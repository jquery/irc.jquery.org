[00:00:14] <coldhead> ?mlm
[00:00:14] <bot-t1> much like myself
[00:00:14] <gnarf> mekwall: seems that thats pulling items out of the original list
[00:00:21] <gnarf> mekwall: other than that its a huge step forward
[00:00:50] <gnarf> leave that in a bot-t1: tell for ryanneufeld maybe ?
[00:01:03] <gnarf> althought who knows if bot-t1 will make it through til tomorrow ;)
[00:02:08] <gnarf> mekwall: the idea was that the original list not lose any items / be sortable itself
[00:03:41] <mekwall> gnarf: alright
[00:03:43] <gnarf> anyway - gnight - if you get another demo, pm it to me so i don't lose it to buffer ;)
[00:03:46] <mekwall> gnarf: on it :P
[00:05:43] <gnarf> so yeah, drag from the original list wouldn't edit the original list HTML at all
[00:05:52] <chrislabeard> okay another question with a select field is there a way to change an option to selected? it seems like .val() only changes whats in the field but not that its actually selected.
[00:06:12] <coldhead> .attr('selected', 'selected')
[00:06:30] <gnarf> chrislabeard: .val() will work on a select - you just have to give it the value of an option
[00:06:34] <gnarf> not the "text"
[00:06:56] <chrislabeard> gnarf: yeah I've given it the value but it seems that the first option still stays selected
[00:11:16] <mishal> hello, how can I detect if jquery ui button is loaded?
[00:11:39] <mishal> if(typeof $.button == 'function') does not work
[00:16:51] <mishal> if(typeof jQuery.ui.button != 'undefined') works ok !
[00:35:11] <mekwall> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/4Rf4Y/
[00:35:14] <mekwall> gnarf: problem solved
[00:35:25] <mekwall> gnarf: just use connectToSortable for the draggables
[00:36:26] <diverdude> Is there any reason why one shouldn't always use $.live() to attach events?
[00:36:48] <mekwall> ?tell ryanneufeld gnarf told me about your problem. here's the solution: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/4Rf4Y/
[00:36:49] <bot-t1> mekwall, Okay.
[00:37:09] <mekwall> diverdude: rather use .delegate
[00:37:17] <mekwall> ?delegate @ diverdude
[00:37:18] <bot-t1> diverdude, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:37:18] <diverdude> mekwall, why is it better?
[00:37:38] <mekwall> diverdude: .live is attached to the whole document, while delegate is attached to a selector
[00:37:51] <mekwall> diverdude: usually, you don't need to attach to the whole document :)
[00:38:08] <mekwall> diverdude: then delegate is much faster
[00:38:12] <diverdude> mekwall, aha i see...and what downside is there to attach to the whole document instead of element
[00:38:28] <diverdude> or i mean selector
[00:38:32] <mekwall> diverdude: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4579117/jquery-live-vs-delegate
[00:39:34] <mekwall> diverdude: its just slower
[00:39:51] <diverdude> mekwall, aha ok...very interesting. Thank you
[00:40:19] <mekwall> diverdude: let's say you have $("a").live(function(){ ... });
[00:40:30] <mekwall> diverdude: that would trigger for all clicks that are made on anchor elements
[00:40:31] <diverdude> yes
[00:41:06] <mekwall> diverdude: while $("#foo").delegate("a", "click", function(){ ... }); would only trigger for clicks on anchor elements that reside within #foo
[00:41:39] <diverdude> mekwall, but what id you really do want anchor events on the entire page?
[00:41:50] <mekwall> diverdude: so a good pratice, always narrow it down to the closest selector
[00:41:50] <diverdude> id=if
[00:42:22] <mekwall> diverdude: well, if you want to attach to the click event for all anchors on the page... then .live is the one to use
[00:42:40] <diverdude> yeah ok.....that makes good sense
[00:42:47] <diverdude> great...thx man :)
[00:43:04] <mekwall> diverdude: $(document.body).delegate("a", function(){ ... }); is the same as $.live("a", function(){ ... });
[00:57:40] <JKarsrud> mekwall: don't you mean $('a').live('click', fn); ?
[01:31:13] <mooKoo> Hi, I need a statement that does smth like this: $("#textField").val("No Text").delay(5000).val(""); this thing here isn't working and I don't know why
[01:33:16] <quicksilver> mooKoo: because delay delays things in queues - mostly animations - and .val() doesn't use any queue.
[01:33:35] <quicksilver> I would just use setTimeout (plain javascript, not jQuery) to schedule the val("")
[01:33:36] <mooKoo> aw damn, makes sense...
[01:45:16] <mcnellis> Is it possible to attach a handler to some selection, and have it apply for elements that are created after the page load? e.g. Have a blank HTML page with <script>$('select').live('change', function(){ alert('foo'); });</script> and then have some script create a <select> on the page, and have the handler be attached when it is created?
[01:48:36] <quicksilver> mcnellis: Yes, that's the point of 'live'
[01:48:43] <quicksilver> (although that's not actualy how it works)
[01:52:06] <JakeyChan> hi ?
[01:52:33] <JakeyChan> is there has query plugin for requesting server with POST in crossing domain ??
[01:53:40] <chewedon> Why am I getting a "missing ) after argument list" error from Firefox with this code: http://pastebin.com/yQ5R1Xx4
[01:53:51] <chewedon> (it's reporting the error is line 31)
[01:54:30] <chewedon> oh hang on, typo in my pastebin, should have a closing } for the funct() {} right after document ready
[01:54:53] <iYuri> hi all
[01:55:02] <chewedon> (my real code does have that close }, I just had a typo when I paste bin, the problem is still there)
[01:55:53] <quicksilver> chewedon: you haven't got a ) for the .ready(
[01:56:23] <chewedon> quicksilver: that's also a typo in my pastebin, sorry -_-!
[01:56:57] <quicksilver> chewedon: well this is pointless.
[01:57:05] <chewedon> Basically, after the page has loaded, i want jQuery to register a few click events for a row of thumbnails I have on my page.
[01:57:07] <quicksilver> chewedon: if you want help you have to paste the *exact* code that actually gives the error.
[01:57:33] <quicksilver> there's no point asking for help with a syntax error and pasting the wrong code which has other syntax errors.
[01:57:41] <iYuri> can somebody explain me what I'm doing wrong?
[01:57:46] <iYuri> I know that I'm missing something
[01:57:50] <iYuri> but I don't know what
[01:57:53] <iYuri> http://pastebin.com/q60BgtJt
[01:58:09] <iYuri> my problem is into line 6 -> $.get
[01:58:24] <iYuri> exactly on the inner $("a.order").click function
[01:58:40] <iYuri> when I first click on the a.order link
[01:58:52] <iYuri> it rightly load the content into the div
[01:58:58] <iYuri> but on the second click
[01:58:59] <chewedon> http://pastebin.com/AcnNb68k
[01:59:02] <iYuri> it does nothing
[01:59:34] <iYuri> there is a way to exit the function or something like that?
[01:59:38] <quicksilver> chewedon: and that gives the same error in FF?
[02:00:24] <chewedon> It's giving this: http://pastebin.com/sMWW99py
[02:00:55] <quicksilver> chewedon: you need () around that anonymous function
[02:01:06] <quicksilver> (function() { ... body goes here })();
[02:01:12] <quicksilver> function() { ... body goes here }();
[02:01:27] <quicksilver> although, also that is quite pointless in the code you've pasted :)
[02:01:47] <quicksilver> why are you creating that function just to call it? You're not doing anything with the scope you've created
[02:02:14] <quicksilver> iYuri: why do you have all this " document.getElementById" ? You are supposed to be using jQuery :P
[02:02:53] <chewedon> well, the thing is when I do the jQuery().click(function () { ... } ); it only binds the code to the last element in the loop
[02:03:25] <chewedon> I want each thumbnail to have call their own "instance" of the function
[02:03:32] <quicksilver> chewedon: OK but to fix that you need to store "i" inside the function
[02:03:35] <quicksilver> you're not doing that
[02:03:42] <quicksilver> so the code you have pasted doesn't actually fix that poblem.
[02:03:45] <iYuri> quicksilver: they are all pieces of codes adapted to what I have to do!
[02:03:53] <iYuri> at the end I will clear the entire code :P
[02:03:54] <chewedon> so function(i) { return function () { ... } } (i);  ?
[02:04:24] <quicksilver> chewedon: yes indeed except you also need the () as I said above.
[02:05:05] <quicksilver> iYuri: I can't really tell, there is too much going on without being able to run it, sorry
[02:06:24] <iYuri> the problem is that I cannot upload the code
[02:06:32] <chewedon> I tried wrapping () around it like ( function (i) { return function() { ... } }(i);)  but now it says missing ) in parenthical
[02:06:40] <quicksilver> chewedon: no.
[02:06:43] <iYuri> because it has a database from where it fetches data
[02:06:49] <quicksilver> (function() { ....})();
[02:06:54] <chewedon> oh ok
[02:08:47] <quicksilver> iYuri: I feel your pain but there is not much I can do. Try to make a smaller example you can show us and you'll probably work it out
[02:09:32] <jrockjiggz> hi.. has anyone used jquery validate for a phone field? the example requires delegate.js but its a dead link..
[02:09:37] <mekwall> JKarsrud: yeah thats what I meant lol
[02:09:37] <chewedon> Doesn't like this, same error: ( function(i) { ... })(i);
[02:10:12] <karim> hi
[02:11:32] <chewedon> ah, there we go
[02:11:37] <chewedon> I needed to remove the ; after (i);
[02:11:49] <quicksilver> yes, in your example you do
[02:11:53] <quicksilver> since it's in an argument list
[02:11:56] <quicksilver> it's not a statement.
[02:12:06] <quicksilver> (it's an expression)
[02:13:29] <chewedon> quicksilver:  thanks for the help :)
[02:16:11] <iYuri> ok quicksilver, i'll try!
[02:16:18] <iYuri> give me a fex minutes:)
[02:18:04] <iYuri> uhmmm....my problem is into the $.get function
[02:18:15] <iYuri> how could i do to make a smaller example? :)
[02:18:22] <iYuri> I need 2 different files
[02:27:12] <slavabulgakov> hi all! I do $("#label").fadeOut(0).delay(1000).fadeIn(0); and getting "Uncaught TypeError: Object irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#%3CObject%3E has no method 'delay'" what's the problem?
[02:27:49] <ravenzz> wat
[02:29:15] <iYuri> http://pastebin.com/q60BgtJt
[02:29:21] <iYuri> a.sce is a simple clickable list
[02:29:32] <iYuri> when clicked it load a content into div.show
[02:29:49] <ravenzz> ?demo @ slavabulgakov
[02:29:50] <iYuri> into this div show, I have other jquery object
[02:29:50] <bot-t> slavabulgakov, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:30:20] <iYuri> like a column edit (a simple image, whne clicked shows a popoum with an editable field)
[02:30:24] <iYuri> and it works fine!
[02:30:36] <iYuri> the problem is that when I click on a.order
[02:30:52] <iYuri> I explain: a.order is a link on the top of a table
[02:30:55] <iYuri> it is a column name
[02:31:06] <iYuri> and when clicke it should reload the div.show content
[02:31:14] <iYuri> passing some params throught $_GET
[02:31:20] <quicksilver> is the table inside div.show, iYuri ?
[02:31:25] <iYuri> yep
[02:31:31] <quicksilver> well once it's been reloaded once
[02:31:35] <quicksilver> then it no longer has event handlers
[02:31:39] <iYuri> I have a php file that create the table
[02:31:51] <quicksilver> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F

[02:34:56] <iYuri> thank you guys!! ^^
[02:35:02] <iYuri> it seems to be quite hard to me
[02:35:10] <iYuri> I'll try and let you know shortly
[02:35:35] <iYuri> or, if you any suggestion to make my correction faster...feel free to tell it ..eheheh
[02:36:17] <iYuri> so, if i'm understanding correctly
[02:36:57] <iYuri> I just have to tell my script: hey, there are new objects to watch
[02:37:13] <iYuri> *handle
[02:39:38] <slavabulgakov> ravenzz: http://futbix.ru/
[02:40:14] <NodeX> use delegate
[02:43:29] <iYuri> should it be right like this?
[02:43:30] <iYuri> http://pastebin.com/S4FUUWuK
[02:43:58] <NodeX> yup
[02:44:42] <NodeX> why do you use jQuery() for some selectors and $.get() ... why ont use $ all the time for your own sanity lol
[02:47:06] <iYuri> eheheh
[02:47:09] <iYuri> you're right
[02:47:20] <iYuri> code still needs to be cleaned
[02:50:24] <iYuri> wooooooooooooooooo
[02:50:27] <iYuri> it works fineeeeeeeeee
[02:50:33] <iYuri> thank you all guys!! :)
[03:00:41] <solsTiCe> hi. I have this code on opera that does not work. $('.hidden').removeClass('hidden'); where .hidden { display: none; } even with a show() it still does not show up.
[03:02:10] <iYuri> what about $('.hidden').attr("style","display: block;") ??
[03:02:12] <iYuri> or inline
[03:03:47] <solsTiCe> yes. I'll try it. but that strange http://jsfiddle.net/deM2Q/ is working on opera
[03:07:09] <iYuri> solsTiCe
[03:07:20] <iYuri> when does you remove the "hidden" class?
[03:07:47] <solsTiCe> on the window.onload
[03:08:54] <solsTiCe> http://jsfiddle.net/deM2Q/1/
[03:09:40] <solsTiCe> isn't window.onload supposed to happen after document.ready ?
[03:12:17] <solsTiCe> oh my. so I am running this code in window.onload because I have a canvas. and use flashcanvas to fall back on IE6-7-8. but running my js in document.ready was too soon because flashcanvas is not loaded at document.ready. so i run it in window.onload instead...
[03:13:25] <blackspotwiggins> solsTiCe, doesnt flashcanvas have a callback for when it's ready?
[03:15:15] <solsTiCe> I don't think so. I llok into that.
[03:29:24] <Hopsy> seen sugaslide

[03:29:43] <Hopsy> -.-
[03:29:54] <Hopsy> where is lampoon ?
[03:32:21] <solsTiCe> that's weirder and weirder. if I add a second class every where and use $('.hidden').show().removeClass() it works but not $('.hidden').removeClass().show()
[03:40:29] <JKarsrud> Hopsy: SugaSlide is on vacation
[03:40:40] <Hopsy> really?
[03:40:41] <Hopsy> owh
[03:40:44] <JKarsrud> yeah
[03:41:29] <JKarsrud> what did you want him for? :)
[03:42:15] <NodeX> has anyone attempted to make a DOM delegate / change plugin // delegating on an element and if it chanegs (new stuff added to it) and applying to those new elements
[03:42:46] <Hopsy> a couple years ago he developed an iphone program if I am not wrong
[03:43:15] <Hopsy> I would to ask him what he used for
[03:45:07] <JKarsrud> NodeX: isn't that just what ?delegate does?
[03:45:13] <JKarsrud> ?delegate
[03:45:13] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:45:22] <NodeX> nope
[03:45:30] <NodeX> it listens for clicks, hovers etc
[03:45:36] <NodeX> I mean when a new element is added
[03:45:43] <JKarsrud> aha, like that
[03:46:17] <JKarsrud> Hmm, don't know of a plugin that does that, no
[03:46:33] <NodeX> kinda a change() but for divs
[03:46:38] <NodeX> and non form elements
[03:46:39] <JKarsrud> mm
[03:46:48] <NodeX> I'd better go make one then lol
[03:46:55] <JKarsrud> Heh, try it :)
[03:47:29] <JKarsrud> iirc, delegate can bind to custom events too, so you could just publish a custom, namespaced event in your code, tho
[03:48:27] <NodeX> good point
[03:49:40] <JKarsrud> Which would be cleaner that writing a plugin that would have to handle all kinds of dom update events etc
[03:50:12] <NodeX> easier to qrite A plugin and make it global.. I'm way into a project and can't go messing now :S
[03:50:59] <NodeX> qrite -> write *
[03:57:38] <JKarsrud> aight, I just know that dom update events etc can be hard to write good, cross browser plugins for
[04:35:26] <Ankabout> can anyone help me fix this error http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/SS8M8/17/
[04:35:40] <Ankabout> I get an error in the console every time the loop resets
[04:35:53] <Ankabout> "Cannot read property of '0' of undefined"
[04:44:12] <apfrod> Ankabout: first off it's eating memory since the recursive function(s) never get to return
[04:44:45] <seutje> and it loops once too many
[04:44:49] <seutje> shouldn't go up to 3
[04:44:54] <Ankabout> apfrod, someone helped me with this, so I'm afraid I don't know how to fix it...
[04:45:20] <Ankabout> seutje, that's what I thought, but I can't seem to find out how to fix that
[04:45:51] <Ankabout> it checks when the last item is reached in the array, and then sets to 0... that should bring it back to the beginning no?
[04:46:09] <apfrod> if(x >= colors.length){ should be if(x > colors.length){
[04:46:36] <apfrod> no wait
[04:46:41] <seutje> nah
[04:46:44] <seutje> just length - 1
[04:47:20] <seutje> just using > would make it error twice
[04:47:30] <Ankabout> ahhh yeah!
[04:47:32] <Ankabout> thanks!
[04:47:36] <Ankabout> damn that I didn't try that
[04:47:38] <dirkpennings> Ankabout, in your loop you're trying to read array[0], [1], [2] and [3] due to your if statement.. http://jsfiddle.net/SS8M8/18/
[04:47:42] <dirkpennings> ah ok
[04:47:48] <Ankabout> and apfrod, how can I stop the error issue?
[04:47:54] <Ankabout> I mean memory issue
[04:47:57] <dirkpennings> many here are quicker than me hehe :)
[04:48:06] <Ankabout> hehe
[04:48:18] <seutje> also, you should probably cache the result of $('html') outside of your loop
[04:48:26] <seutje> chances of that changing seem rather remote
[04:48:47] <Ankabout> would that help page load time?
[04:48:55] <Ankabout> and how?
[04:50:33] <michael_imac> hmm I'm getting Unexpected end of input for this line player_scripts += '<script type="text/javascript">jwplayer("player").setup({"flashplayer": "/javascripts/jwplayer/player.swf", "id": "player", "width": "640", "height": "480", "file": "http://somefile.mp4"});</script>';
[04:51:08] <michael_imac> ideas?
[04:54:37] <apfrod> Ankabout: http://jsfiddle.net/SS8M8/19/
[04:55:10] <apfrod> not sure about self-calling jquery functions.
[04:55:10] <Ankabout> thanks apfrod! does that also stop the memory eating thing?
[04:55:26] <apfrod> Ankabout: no, if that's even a problem
[04:55:49] <Ankabout> nah not really, but you mentioned it :)
[04:57:07] <apfrod> stops rising after a while.. something must clean up
[05:20:03] <sadmicrowave> morning, I'm looking for some help with optimization of ui elements.  I have this demo and I know I could be doing things more efficiently, please help with any suggestions, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/gB4ca/
[05:22:33] <Hooloovoo> sadmicrowave: you could actually create the elements instead of just putting html in a string
[05:22:50] <Hooloovoo> sadmicrowave: but make a working jsfiddle and i'll know more
[05:24:25] <sadmicrowave> Hooloovoo, what about the way I'm getting iHeight.  Is there a way to a) have the height of ui-state-highlight auto adjust so I don't have to declare the height manually, or b) find the height of an element without appending to the dom first? (i know appending and removing dom elements is expensive and would like to avoid where possible)
[05:26:43] <NodeX> It's much more efficient to concat strings and do one big create than to keep adding elements to the DOM
[05:26:56] <NodeX> you are doing it correctly in terms of memory management
[05:27:41] <sadmicrowave> NodeX, ok, what about removes, is detach() less expensive than remove()?
[05:27:55] <NodeX> I use empty()
[05:28:05] <sadmicrowave> ?empty
[05:28:06] <bot-t> .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[05:28:19] <Hooloovoo> sadmicrowave: well, instead of building info like that you can do http://paste.ofcode.org/xvRdDRVFcU3K89eqebuJja
[05:28:24] <NodeX> it removes data and handlers too iirc
[05:28:32] <erichynds> sadmicrowave: detach and remove serve two different purposes
[05:28:35] <Hooloovoo> that way you prolly won't have to append it to the dom to get the height
[05:28:55] <sadmicrowave> NodeX, If I empty() a selector then $('selector').length will still be > 0 right?
[05:29:20] <NodeX> should be yes
[05:30:05] <sadmicrowave> NodeX, well thats not going to work then, once I 'remove' it I don't want length > 0
[05:30:20] <NodeX> what ?
[05:30:29] <sadmicrowave> Hooloovoo, that creates the element but to get the height I still have to append it do the dom, otherwise height = 0
[05:30:33] <NodeX> and no.. I misread what you said
[05:30:43] <NodeX> ?empty
[05:30:43] <bot-t> .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[05:31:00] <sadmicrowave> NodeX, yea, that removes the child elements, leaving the parent container
[05:31:07] <sadmicrowave> or at least thats how it sounds
[05:31:25] <NodeX> dude it removes the element and it's children
[05:31:45] <NodeX> err .. ignore me .. brain fart
[05:32:28] <NodeX> use remove(); to emove the element and its children .. use detach to remove it and keep it's data and events
[05:32:48] <sadmicrowave> NodeX, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/sdyPb/
[05:33:00] <sadmicrowave> lol
[05:33:02] <sadmicrowave> ok
[05:33:08] <NodeX> [13:31:25] <NodeX> dude it removes the element and it's children
[05:33:08] <NodeX> [13:31:45] <NodeX> err .. ignore me .. brain fart
[05:33:12] <sadmicrowave> yea just saw that
[05:34:51] <sadmicrowave> I'm not trying to be difficult guys, just trying to get a handle on these functions to make my doc as lean as possible
[05:39:50] <sadmicrowave> Hooloovoo, so this is your suggestion?: http://paste.ofcode.org/3TE3BXSZ7Wrqm84NtKM6gR
[05:40:21] <code_in> hi
[05:40:51] <code_in> how to submit the text content in the div
[05:42:00] <NodeX> ?
[05:42:06] <NodeX> ?demo @ code_in
[05:42:06] <bot-t> code_in, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:43:51] <code_in> http://jsfiddle.net/uKWqk/
[05:44:14] <NodeX> lol
[05:44:30] <NodeX> a proper demo, there isn't even any javascript in that
[05:45:12] <code_in> i only want to submit the form, a div and a text inside the div.  No javascript is there
[05:45:52] <NodeX> if you cannot be bothered to setup a proper demo or at least trey to then I doubt anyone will help you
[05:45:58] <NodeX> try*
[05:47:19] <code_in> Nodex:  I only want to know wether a div with text inside can be posted as we do other html element like text box, textarea
[05:47:37] <NodeX> $("#your-div").val()
[05:48:46] <code_in> that will give the value of the div, then should i have to do it through ajax?
[05:48:53] <NodeX> yes
[05:50:03] <code_in> is there any disadvantage in doing through ajax, as i have heard it has some restrictions like only some limited number of bytes can be sent
[05:50:25] <NodeX> I have never found any disadvantages except no fil support
[05:50:27] <NodeX> fiel*
[05:50:29] <NodeX> file**
[05:52:33] <sadmicrowave> code_in, there is no limit on bytes that can be sent through ajax, although you may not need ajax.  just put an action='MyPageToLoad.xxx' in your form tag
[05:52:44] <NodeX> err
[05:52:57] <sadmicrowave> unless you are trying to update things on your page without refresh...then use ajax
[05:53:12] <NodeX> he want's to send the text content of a div to a script and normal forms will not do that so ajax must be used
[05:55:16] <sadmicrowave> NodeX, $('input[type="submit"]').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('<input type="hidden" name="myname"/>').val( $('div').text() ); $('form').submit(); .....
[05:55:42] <NodeX> quicker to use ajax
[05:55:44] <sadmicrowave> prevent the submit from firing at first, put the contents of div in a hidden input, then submit the form
[05:55:56] <NodeX> and more efficient
[05:56:31] <sadmicrowave> NodeX, its not quicker if he is going to turn around right after the ajax call and refresh the page anyways...thats just 2 calls to the server instead of 1
[05:56:52] <NodeX> it's quicker and more efficient
[05:57:18] <sadmicrowave> potentially 2 calls is more efficient than 1? hmm? I've never heard that...
[05:57:29] <NodeX> the user has never stated he would refresh the page
[05:57:36] <NodeX> you assumed he would ..
[05:57:39] <sadmicrowave> he never stated he wouldn't
[05:58:06] <sadmicrowave> we are both operating on speculation since he didn't provide a lot of detail
[05:58:10] <Spazholio> Can anyone tell me why the following code works in Firefox, but not in Chrome/Chromium?  http://pastebin.com/zyFyriU5
[05:58:33] <NodeX> are you still on about this lol
[05:58:44] <sadmicrowave> NodeX, your way is correct given the first scenario, and my way would be correct given the second
[05:58:46] <sadmicrowave> lol
[05:58:47] <sadmicrowave> yes
[05:58:59] <NodeX> *yawn*
[05:59:07] <NodeX> Spazholio : what error is given
[05:59:09] <sadmicrowave> wake up and argue with me
[05:59:10] <sadmicrowave> ;)
[05:59:20] <NodeX> go argue in the mirror
[05:59:23] <sadmicrowave> lol
[05:59:26] <NodeX> I have work to do
[05:59:33] <sadmicrowave> not as much fun
[05:59:38] <sadmicrowave> and I don't learn anything
[05:59:46] <Spazholio> NodeX: sorry, should have been more clear.  There is no error given, it just doesn't sort properly.
[05:59:54] <NodeX> well you are argiug with a brick wall becase you will never prove me wrong
[06:00:26] <NodeX> Spazholio : can you log the key ?
[06:00:35] <NodeX> ** the return value of the hasClass() ?
[06:02:39] <Spazholio> NodeX: I can log the return value of hasClass(), but that's correct in both browsers.  Tried logging the key value, but was dealing with a large dataset and it was getting...chaotic.
[06:03:04] <NodeX> break after the first one ? ..
[06:03:22] <NodeX> I would imagine it's got something to do with integer comparison
[06:03:49] <Spazholio> I can trim it down and check again.  And break as well.  Figured I'd try an ask in here to see if it was obvious to anyone right off the bat.
[06:03:51] <NodeX> try this ... var keyA = parseInt($(a).text()); ... var keyB = parseInt($(b).text());
[06:04:24] <Spazholio> k, 1 sec
[06:04:35] <NodeX> sometimes a JS engine will return as strings rather than int's ... and for an int to be greater than a string summit weird is going on
[06:05:58] <NodeX> also ... key A greater than key b =1 ... key a less than key b = 1 ...
[06:06:12] <NodeX> they are returning the same value each time !
[06:06:42] <Spazholio> Negative.  Now it doesn't sort in FF, and Chrome stays the same.  What's odd about it is that in Chrome, when I click the Sort button, the top 2 links change each time.  So you're right - something wonky is going on.
[06:07:28] <NodeX> log the keyA/Keyb in the console and its typeof()
[06:07:40] <Spazholio> Will do.
[06:07:54] <NodeX> I think some of the logix is wonky
[06:10:53] <Spazholio> typeof() is always string, both browsers.
[06:11:02] <NodeX> after parseInt ?
[06:11:31] <Spazholio> Errrr....no.  I took that out.  Because I'm apparently retarded.  1 sec.
[06:11:33] <NodeX> that means one is typecasting and the other isn't .. so normalise it with parseInt() / parsetFloat()
[06:12:57] <Spazholio> Ok, they all return as 'number' now, and all the values are NaN - both browsers.
[06:13:27] <NodeX> can you jsfiddle the code so I can play wiht it ?
[06:14:09] <Spazholio> After googling "jsfiddle" - yes.  Give me a moment.  =)
[06:14:42] <consumerism> i am writing a plugin (my first!), mostly refactoring standalone functions. i had a function which called itself and i can't figure out how to replicate that in the plugin setup. i have var methods = {} like in the plugin documentation, and i tried this.myMethod() but I get an error saying it's not a function. how can i call a function from itself inside a var methods = {} in a plugin?

[06:16:34] <NodeX> ta, gimme a min
[06:17:49] <NodeX> I think it's to much foir the parseInt() function ...
[06:18:34] <Spazholio> How so?
[06:18:41] <sadmicrowave> has anyone else had problems with the newest (2.0) release of niceforms?
[06:19:44] <sadmicrowave> namely issues with malformed css strings and unrecognized functions (i.e. .unload() ) in FF3.6
[06:21:39] <NodeX> 2 mins Spazholio  I have a soloution
[06:27:58] <billcosb> Spazholio
[06:28:08] <billcosb> just drop the parseInt
[06:28:23] <billcosb> var keyA = $(a).text(); var keyB = $(b).text();
[06:28:26] <NodeX> billcosb : it doesnt work
[06:28:38] <Spazholio> billcosb: my initial code is without the parseInt.  And then it works in one of two browsers.
[06:29:04] <billcosb> oh, sorry
[06:29:09] <billcosb> I just tested on ff
[06:29:34] <Spazholio> Yes, so did I.  And then I tested on Chrome.  And there was much swearing, and gnashing of teeth.
[06:31:02] <billcosb> what about String.localeCompare?
[06:31:54] <billcosb> or String.toLowerCase.localeComapre
[06:33:47] <Trisox> hello any one found a workaround for http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=164 ?

[07:05:03] <javascript_noob> when i say print_r($_POST), i am getting Array()
[07:06:24] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:07:44] <billcosb> you should add this - type: "post"
[07:07:59] <billcosb> to your $.ajax settings
[07:08:06] <savolai> hi. how easy would it be to customize http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/ to be horizontal, or does it make sense to use custom stuff like http://www.madeincima.it/en/articles/resources-and-tools/easy-accordion-plugin/ ?
[07:10:25] <drwits> hi guys... jquery newb... i have a page with a bunch of nodes (drupal) with .features class. wanting to target each p:gt(2) on each node
[07:10:36] <drwits> i'm only able to get the first one
[07:17:17] <javascript_noob> $ajax is for get
[07:17:29] <javascript_noob> $.post is for post
[07:18:21] <Hooloovoo> javascript_noob: no
[07:18:25] <Hooloovoo> $.ajax can do both
[07:19:06] <Hooloovoo> $.get does get
[07:21:06] <trose> is there a way to parse a post response with $.ajax or $.post?
[07:21:18] <trose> or does that require something like php?
[07:23:00] <trose> Hooloovoo, do you happen to know? ^^^ I want to access the post response on a page
[07:24:37] <Ruum> hey guys, I have an unordered list, and I need to insert the ' | ' into it, how do I do that?
[07:26:02] <trose> Ruum, I'm not sure what you mean? can you elaborate?
[07:26:29] <Ruum> lets see if I can give you a paste bin:
[07:27:19] <Hooloovoo> trose: you'd have to use a server language
[07:29:11] <trose> Hooloovoo, okay
[07:30:09] <m1chael> im trying to use .change() on a textbox. the code works when i type something in, and leave/unfocus from the textbox. the code will not work if some other code programmically sets the value of the textbox.. how can i get it to work? (without modifying the other code that sets the value in this textbox)
[07:31:45] <Ruum> trose: http://pastebin.com/A6LbWNGW
[07:33:09] <Ruum> trose: since I am working with drupal, I need to know how to modify through jquery and CSS using drupal's stuff.
[07:34:10] <NodeX> drupal :(
[07:34:34] <trose> Ruum, You're trying to just add ' | ' in between each list item?
[07:35:16] <maela> hi
[07:35:31] <NodeX> $("li").each(function(index) {$(this).after("<li>|</li>");}); ?
[07:35:41] <trose> I'm no expert on drupal but it seems like you could do that with jquery using .each and appending ' | '
[07:35:50] <NodeX> ^ ^
[07:35:52] <Ruum> AWESOME NodeX !!!!
[07:35:57] <trose> NodeX++
[07:35:59] <trose> :D
[07:36:27] <NodeX> obvisouly give the LI selector some context
[07:36:28] <Ruum> NodeX: I dont see the append function in there ?
[07:36:37] <NodeX> append what ? ..
[07:36:44] <NodeX> you are not appending anything
[07:36:47] <NodeX> ?after
[07:36:47] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/

[07:37:28] <m1chael> im trying to use .change() on a textbox. the code works when i type something in, and leave/unfocus from the textbox. the code will not work if some other code programmically sets the value of the textbox.. how can i get it to work? (without modifying the other code that sets the value in this textbox)
[07:37:49] <NodeX> oh yer .. might want a not() too!
[07:38:36] <maela> I set a "select" handler for an option. I can access the element that triggered the event usring for example the srcElement in the handler. The problem is that this is a simple HTML Element, it hasn't any of the jquery methods. Is there anyway to apply jquery methods to it? For example... object.parent().
[07:38:47] <NodeX> m1chael : change() is a series of events so you must trigger them ...  .. try with your program .. $("#the-textbox").trigger('change');
[07:39:25] <Ruum> phlp: that is a great idea, expect there is another element that has different text to it that needs to be altered differently.
[07:39:26] <NodeX> maela : it must be a jquery object to apply the methods
[07:40:20] <maela> NodeX: I see. So I must re-search the element in the handler, to get a jquery capable object?
[07:40:28] <NodeX> yes
[07:41:03] <NodeX> it's not slow .. it will fallback to getElementById() where available and classNames also
[07:41:19] <Ruum> phlp: how do I make it so that it only has a specific id?
[07:42:00] <maela> NodeX: thanks. Well it is a bit of a waste to research the tree when I just have the element :D
[07:42:14] <phlp> Ruum: are you asking how to select by id or how to made drupal give that list an id?
[07:42:51] <m1chael> nodex, where would i put that code?
[07:43:00] <NodeX> in your method
[07:43:08] <maela> NodeX: to make it clear. This is what I want to do http://pastebin.com/jTTkm3Jv . It is just 1 line.
[07:43:39] <m1chael> http://dpaste.com/635931/
[07:43:47] <Ruum> phlp: lets start with "how to make drupal give that list an id"
[07:43:53] <m1chael> inside of $(':input[name=customer]').change(function() {  ??
[07:44:02] <NodeX> maela : $(this) would already be the object
[07:44:02] <m1chael> or $(function() {
[07:44:22] <NodeX> so ... ino your calculate funciton .. $(this).parent()... would achieve it
[07:44:22] <maela> NodeX: ahhh!!!. Great then. Just a starter here. Thanks mate.
[07:44:31] <phlp> Ruum: cant help you there ive never used it. i would assume there is a template somewhere you could edit?
[07:44:35] <NodeX> but you might want parents('selector');
[07:44:57] <NodeX> m1chael : if that is where your "program" is doing the changingt hen yes
[07:45:00] <NodeX> then yes *
[07:45:05] <Ruum> phlp: that is fine.  I think I can handle the drupal part.
[07:45:10] <m1chael> the program that is doing to changing i dont really have access to
[07:45:46] <phlp> Ruum: if that class="menu" was id="menu" instead you could do $('#menu li:not(.last)').append('<span>|</span>');
[07:45:47] <NodeX> then you can't trigger a change
[07:46:05] <NodeX> well you can but not in sync with the program unless you cna extend it
[07:46:12] <Ruum> phlp: can you help me tell jquery how to give an element a specific id ?
[07:46:13] <NodeX> can extend it **
[07:47:27] <samtuke> with jquery mobile, do desktop browsers show the same theme / interface as mobiles? can jquery mobile ui only be loaded when mobile browsers are detected?
[07:47:50] <phlp> Ruum: you can do .attr('id','menu') but if you need the id because selecting the right one is a problem then that doesnt help (because you have to select it first to do this)
[07:48:50] <JackBauer24> Anyone know some good plugin to display images in select box? Support for image and text at the same time would be nice.
[07:56:07] <samtuke> Jquery mobile is not intended to also be used for desktop viewing it seems, so is there documentation on combining the jquery frameworks to make a single site appear correctly on both mobile and desktop devices?: "we aim to synthesize a touch-friendly design language that can work well across a range of form factors from smartphone to tablet and a range of *mobile* platforms"
[07:58:25] <phrearch> hello

[07:59:13] <phrearch> phlp: ah thanks!

[07:59:33] <sn0lan_> no problem lad
[08:00:29] <maela> I want to get a select that is below a td with a id name. I'm trying this but it is not working $("select[id="school-full-view-course-week"]). Any help?
[08:01:11] <sn0lan_> $("td#name").children("select")
[08:01:43] <maela> sn0lan is there anyway to look for the select in all the tree below?
[08:01:54] <sn0lan_> how do you mean?
[08:01:54] <maela> not just the level below?
[08:02:08] <maela> td->whatever->select
[08:02:15] <phlp> .find('select')
[08:02:37] <maela> oh, yeah. You're right. I forgot. and can this select be filtered by id?
[08:03:05] <phlp> theres no reason to go through all that if the select has an id. just select it
[08:03:37] <maela> phlp: sorry, I wanted to mean "class". Excuse me.
[08:03:48] <phrearch> hm, is it normal that $('button.btn').live('mouseover mouseout',function(ev) is triggered on mousemove as well?
[08:03:57] <phlp> maela: .find('select.whatever')
[08:04:12] <maela> right. Thanks mate.
[08:04:32] <samtuke> Is it currently best practice to have a separate front end for mobile and desktop using jquery then? If so what are you guys most commonly using - a mobile subdomain or what?

[08:09:18] <bot-t> Simon_d, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:09:24] <Simon_d> $('#DDshirtsize option:eq(3)').val()
[08:09:35] <Simon_d> is it something to do with the eq()
[08:09:56] <NodeX> what is it returning instead ?
[08:10:44] <Simon_d> Small every time
[08:11:03] <NodeX> <options> dont have a value attribute because the <select> paretn has it
[08:11:08] <NodeX> parent**
[08:11:21] <NodeX> sorry they do have the attribute but not val()
[08:11:28] <kborchers> Simon_d: just do $("#DDshirtsize").val(); that will get the selected value
[08:11:32] <NodeX> ^^
[08:11:35] <phlp> val works on options
[08:11:44] <Simon_d> thing is i dont want the selected value
[08:11:51] <NodeX> I'm assuming you want not the selected
[08:11:52] <phlp> if one of them doesn't have a value the text is returned instead
[08:11:57] <Simon_d> I want the 3rd value in the list
[08:12:05] <kborchers> eq(2)
[08:12:09] <NodeX> eq() is zero basede
[08:12:12] <NodeX> based*
[08:12:51] <NodeX> I never knew that options were allowed the use of val() ... not something I've ever tried .. I always wnt the selected lol
[08:13:28] <flashingpumpkin> guys, is it possible to hook .live up to a 'load' event or similar, eg when part of the website got reloaded
[08:13:53] <Simon_d> this is my problem. I don't care what they select I just need to see if the dropdown contains items im expecting
[08:14:11] <NodeX> flashingpumpkin use delegate()
[08:17:17] <jklmnop> does anyone have any examples of a UI tab transition that pushes one panel out while the other slides in?
[08:21:36] <flashingpumpkin> NodeX, ok. But *is* there any event fired when I .append() or .replace() content?
[08:21:57] <NodeX> nope .. I have been looking at writing a plugin for it today
[08:24:31] <phlp> flashingpumpkin, NodeX: livequery can do that http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[08:25:19] <NodeX> it will listen for nodes being updated and fire stuff ?
[08:25:54] <phlp> it will fire a callback when new elements match your selector
[08:26:15] <jbrokc> can anyone help me make this if { } block syncronous? The .prepend() happens before the .addClass(), resulting in nothing being added https://gist.github.com/f5983a96dd5a9a355500
[08:26:25] <NodeX> nice, I always thought it needed an event
[08:26:33] <jomofcw> phlp imo this old plugin was replaced by the .live() core method.
[08:27:15] <phlp> jomofcw: for events yes it can be handled with .live and .delegate but if you just need to know when something new is added to the page then no
[08:27:19] <jomofcw> OK I'm wrong, if it accepts a function to launch for an element which is just appenede
[08:27:23] <jomofcw> appended
[08:27:33] <jbrokc> can anyone help me make this if { } block syncronous? The .prepend() happens before the .addClass(), resulting in nothing being added https://gist.github.com/f5983a96dd5a9a355500
[08:27:34] <NodeX> sweet, thanks phlp
[08:27:34] <jomofcw> OK thanks phlp
[08:27:43] <jbrokc> whoops - twice to the same channel! sorry!!
[08:28:17] <NodeX> jbrokc : there is a synchronous setting in ajax somewhere
[08:28:20] <NodeX> it's in the docs
[08:29:34] <jomofcw> anyway jbrokc I'm not sure about what you're trying to do...
[08:29:58] <jomofcw> adding class or not you should be able to add data anyway...
[08:30:29] <jklmnop> can anyone explain why there is no hide event for tabs?
[08:31:46] <jomofcw> jklmnop you speak about a tabs plugin maybe ?
[08:31:55] <jklmnop> jquey ui tabs
[08:32:18] <jomofcw> And so, that's prbably because the author thinks it's not needed ^^. What are you trying to do ?
[08:32:27] <jklmnop> jomofcw: for some reason there is no tabs hide event
[08:32:46] <jomofcw> What are you trying to do dude ?
[08:33:03] <jklmnop> jomofcw  i'm trying to have the content of the tabs slides push into each other
[08:33:53] <jklmnop> jomofcw: there is an example of the desired effect here http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/int2.html
[08:34:18] <jklmnop> under "callbacks"
[08:35:43] <jomofcw> OK, but imo you don't need any hide event. The fact is, something is showing and so all other is hiding. So you need the show event, and trigger some stuff in it.
[08:35:44] <jomofcw> imo
[08:35:52] <jomofcw> I'm not sure to be clear there...
[08:36:20] <jklmnop> the hide event would have the old tab content in ui.panel
[08:36:21] <jklmnop> that's why
[08:37:15] <trose> what's the easiest way to save a php variable as a javascript/jquery variable? i'm trying var file_path = '<?= $_FILE["file"]["tmp_name"]?>'; but it's reading that as a string literal
[08:38:52] <NodeX> var a = '<?php echo("BAR"); ?>';
[08:39:50] <tydeas> HellO I want to create a jquery plugin. The problem I am facing is that I want to have a function to init some options and then other functions from the same plugin on the same element have access to the same properties and use them.
[08:39:56] <phlp> jklmnop: if you use the select event, it is fired before the selected tab is shown so you can get the previously selected on with $('.ui-tabs-panel:not(.ui-tabs-hide)')
[08:40:37] <jklmnop> phlp: seems like a lousy hack. not sure why there is no hide event.
[08:40:37] <ravenzz> tydeas http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[08:41:18] <phlp> jklmnop: because you havnt yet submitted the patch that adds it?
[08:43:18] <gnarf> .
[08:45:30] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/4Rf4Y/ mekwall solved it for ya
[08:45:39] <ryanneufeld> no fucking way
[08:45:39] <bot-t> (8 hours 8 mins 40 secs ago) <mekwall> tell ryanneufeld gnarf told me about your problem. here's the solution: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/4Rf4Y/
[08:46:06] <gnarf> apparently there is a "connectWithSortable" option
[08:46:07] <gnarf> lol
[08:46:31] <ryanneufeld> fuck off...
[08:46:38] <JKarsrud> that's a really, really old option gnarf and ryanneufeld
[08:46:40] <ryanneufeld> talk about undocumented feayures!
[08:46:50] <ryanneufeld> *features
[08:47:08] <gnarf> i kow
[08:47:18] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i mean, you'll prollly have to change it in 1.9
[08:47:22] <gnarf> but whatever, it works right? :)
[08:47:24] <ryanneufeld> ?tell mekwall thanks dude... would be nice if that feature was in the docs
[08:47:25] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Okay.
[08:48:07] <JKarsrud> is there a diff between connectWith and connectWithSortable tho?
[08:48:31] <JKarsrud> connectToSortable, sorry
[08:48:48] <JKarsrud> ahh, draggable with sortable, right =)
[08:48:50] <JKarsrud> my bad
[08:48:57] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[08:49:03] <tydeas> ravenzz: http://www.virgentech.com/blog/2009/10/building-object-oriented-jquery-plugin.html yout opinion on this?
[08:49:27] <JKarsrud> but it's not really undocumented, is it, ryanneufeld and gnarf?

[08:51:06] <JKarsrud> ryanneufeld: hah :)
[08:51:09] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: gnarf, thanks guys. I totally didn't RTFM enough
[08:51:15] <JKarsrud> Anyways, off to the gym :D
[08:51:15] <ryanneufeld> JKarsrud: you too
[08:51:16] <mekwall> o/
[08:51:17] <bot-t> (3 mins 52 secs ago) <ryanneufeld> tell mekwall thanks dude... would be nice if that feature was in the docs
[08:51:25] <ryanneufeld> mekwall: ignore that
[08:51:28] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i totally DID read the manual, and never saw that option ;)
[08:51:31] <ryanneufeld> it is, I'm blind
[08:51:38] <kborchers> same here
[08:51:41] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I was looking at the droppable
[08:51:41] <mekwall> ryanneufeld: hehe, me too
[08:51:42] * kborchers hide
[08:51:46] <JKarsrud> the docs are kinda hard :D
[08:51:47] <ryanneufeld> not the draggable
[08:51:59] <mekwall> ryanneufeld: to be fair, I found the answer on stackoverflow
[08:52:02] <ryanneufeld> lol
[08:52:21] <mekwall> stackoverflow > most docs
[08:52:23] <ryanneufeld> well, once again the jquery-ui guys blow my mind
[08:52:35] <JKarsrud> haha, you and stackoverflow are just too good of a combo mekwall
[08:52:45] <JKarsrud> anyways, like I said, off to the gym :D
[08:52:51] <mekwall> JKarsrud: gymtard
[08:52:57] <JKarsrud> indeed
[08:53:04] <mekwall> b'bye
[08:53:04] <JKarsrud> gotta look good for the ladies you know :D
[08:53:15] <mekwall> JKarsrud: say that to your gf
[08:53:15] <ryanneufeld> JKarsrud: is brogramming
[08:53:15] <JKarsrud> or the lady, rather
[08:53:23] <mekwall> lol
[08:53:43] <JKarsrud> I'm off!
[08:53:45] <mekwall> JKarsrud: too late, it's on bash.org already
[08:53:50] <JKarsrud> haha
[08:53:52] <JKarsrud> :D
[08:54:05] <ryanneufeld> 90% of that stuff is fake
[08:54:25] <bakers> if var foo = {1:'bar'} makes a new object. Is there a shortcut like that to make an array
[08:54:31] <bakers> var foo = (1,2,3) doesn't work
[08:54:34] <ryanneufeld> and 86% of stats are made up on the spot
[08:55:02] <phlp> bakers: var foo = [1,2,3]
[08:55:07] <mekwall> ryanneufeld: I'm 101%
[08:55:22] <ryanneufeld> I'm over 9000!!!!
[08:55:30] <bakers> phlp: I was so close... thanks
[08:55:35] <mekwall> then I'm 9090? :P
[08:57:03] <ryanneufeld> mekwall++

[09:00:43] <ryanneufeld> <3 bot-t
[09:02:34] <jbrokc> is there a way to call .die() on a filtered jquery selector? so I bind all of these divs with .live("#foo el.class") and then I just want to unbind the ones that are $("#foo el.class.disabled").die() but unfortunately I think .die() needs the same selector. what can I do? it's currently $("#foo el.class").slice(3, $("#foo el.class").length());
[09:02:38] <jbrokc> and yes I know I can cache that selector
[09:03:42] <ryanneufeld> jbrokc: you could use .hasClass in your click logic to just exit the function
[09:03:56] <NodeX> or .. not()
[09:04:08] <NodeX> save the bind entirely
[09:04:22] <jbrokc> NodeX: $("#foo el.class").not(".disabled").die() doesn't work
[09:04:40] <jbrokc> ryanneufeld: it's going to be unbound, so the click handler won't even fire
[09:04:50] <bakers> If I have a an <a> tag and I want to do an ajax call before the user follows the link is that even possible?
[09:04:56] <NodeX> is it a class of disabled or a ":disabled" ?
[09:05:14] <bakers> seems like clicking the a would cause the browser to move on before the ajax has a chance to finish
[09:05:15] <jbrokc> NodeX: class
[09:05:30] <Eviltwin> bakers: You'd probably have to window.location after
[09:06:09] <mekwall> bakers: use event.preventDefault()
[09:06:14] <mekwall> ?.preventDefault @ bakers
[09:06:14] <bot-t> bakers, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:06:24] <bakers> Eviltwin: mekwall On the a tag, and then on success of ajax window.location?
[09:06:34] <Eviltwin> Yes
[09:06:39] <mekwall> bakers: yes, but then why are you using ajax to begin with? ;)
[09:06:57] <bakers> mekwall: My boss wants to "log" everytime some clicks this link
[09:07:16] <mekwall> bakers: ehm...
[09:07:19] <bakers> mekwall: the link is external, so I can't log when the hit it, only before they get there
[09:07:29] <mekwall> bakers: why not just use a proxy-script?
[09:07:59] <bakers> mekwall: What do you mean?
[09:08:06] <mekwall> bakers: what backend language do you use?
[09:08:12] <mekwall> php ? .net ?
[09:08:13] <bakers> mekwall: php
[09:08:31] <muszek> "$(document).ready(function(data) {" produces an error with jslint: "'$' was used before it was defined.".  How do I fix it?
[09:08:34] <JKarsrud> effin' bus.. Arrived way too late, so no gym for me ffs
[09:08:39] <mekwall> bakers: well... out.php?url=<url_here>
[09:08:51] <mekwall> JKarsrud: bwahahaha
[09:08:56] <mekwall> I did it!
[09:09:01] <JKarsrud> yes :/
[09:09:27] <mekwall> bakers: and if you don't want to update your links... you can have jquery do it for you
[09:09:59] <JKarsrud> I need to pick up my gf at 8, and when the bus was 5 minutes delayed, it f'ed up my whole schedule
[09:10:25] <mekwall> bakers: $("a[href^=http://]").each(function(){ this.href =  this.href = "out.php?url="+this.href; });
[09:11:07] <mekwall> bakers: or if you want to mask the proxy url, you could use click and window.location
[09:20:44] <drwits> i'm wanting to hide p:gt(2) on each div as follows... http://pastebin.com/g5jy9xRb
[09:21:10] <drwits> the way i have it hides gt(2) on the whole page
[09:21:32] <drwits> is there a way to target p:gt(2) on each div? thanks a bunch
[09:22:01] <Eviltwin> div p:gt(2)
[09:23:19] <drwits> for some reason it's hiding everything after the third when i do that
[09:23:22] <drwits> every p that is
[09:23:46] <quicksilver> drwits: $('div').each(function() { $(this).find('p:gt(2)').hide(); });
[09:23:48] <sylow> hi guys, i have an url like http://full.com/path/#someid in my content, is there a JQuery function that gets the #someid out of it ?
[09:23:59] <quicksilver> the :gt(2) applies to the top level otherwise.
[09:24:35] <sylow> the link is already an element that I got with href.attr()
[09:24:57] <sylow> attr('href') *
[09:25:57] <quicksilver> sylow: no.
[09:26:09] <quicksilver> sylow: there are a few plugins and scripts around the net that do, though.
[09:26:17] <quicksilver> sylow: google for "jquery parse url"
[09:26:29] <sylow> quicksilver: thanks, probably some substring function could also do it
[09:29:04] <Vinny> yo! Does anyone know of a good reference for jquery optimization for IE ? Some of my code is doing piss poor
[09:29:31] <drwits> thank you quicksilver
[09:33:40] <safzouf> Hi guys
[09:33:58] <safzouf>  I opened jquery.jqzoom
[09:34:10] <safzouf> I don't understant the syntax: function($)
[09:34:18] <safzouf> can anyone clarify?
[09:34:29] <JKarsrud> it's a closure
[09:35:02] <safzouf> what does this mean
[09:35:26] <JKarsrud> if you see in the bottom of the code, there is probably something like }(jQuery), right ?
[09:35:32] <khmer> more specifically it's an anonymous function being used as a closure
[09:35:38] <safzouf> exactly!
[09:35:53] <JKarsrud> khmer: yes, ofc
[09:36:04] <botfather> isnt $ equal to jQuery() ?
[09:36:09] <JKarsrud> not always
[09:36:13] <JKarsrud> and that's the point
[09:36:15] <botfather> sorry just starting with this shizzle ;]
[09:36:28] <safzouf> inside there is a main function:
[09:36:36] <safzouf> $.fn.jqueryzoom = function(options) {  ..........
[09:36:52] <safzouf> where can I find more clarifications about that?
[09:36:54] <JKarsrud> by doing (function($) {})(jQuery); we pass in jQuery as an argument to the function, making sure that $ == jQuery inside that anonymous function
[09:37:12] <botfather> ah ok cool ;]
[09:37:47] <safzouf> stiff confusing guys .. :
[09:37:49] <safzouf> :(
[09:37:53] <safzouf> still
[09:38:04] <safzouf> have you a link, I'll seee it in details
[09:38:12] <tjholowaychuk> how do you grab offset{X,Y} with jquery?
[09:38:17] <JKarsrud> you may not know if some other library or 3rd party overwrites $ to be something else
[09:39:05] <JKarsrud> tjholowaychuk: I think .offset() returns an object with x and y
[09:39:22] <tjholowaychuk> JKarsrud for an event?
[09:39:33] <Ruum> NodeX: what dont you like about Drupal?
[09:39:34] <JKarsrud> for an element
[09:39:35] <JKarsrud> ?offset
[09:39:35] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[09:39:36] <tjholowaychuk> oh
[09:39:38] <tjholowaychuk> damn
[09:39:41] <tjholowaychuk> this is canvas
[09:39:48] <JKarsrud> oh, right
[09:39:49] <tydeas> ravenzz: are you there?
[09:40:01] <tjholowaychuk> grr
[09:40:04] <tjholowaychuk> i hate FF
[09:40:07] <tydeas> ravenzz: you have pointed me to the boilerplate but how can I add more functions to it
[09:40:36] <JKarsrud> tjholowaychuk: hah, yeah :P
[09:41:59] <JKarsrud> tjholowaychuk: but can't you read the element in an event or something?
[09:49:19] <dogarrhea2> so if I have an array of things I would like to post to the server, the only 2 options is to put the contents of that array into a form, or post using "ajax" (hate that buzzword)
[09:51:12] <Edxavier> hi
[09:54:39] <khmer> at this point ajax isn't really a buzzword
[09:54:49] <khmer> it's a colloquialism
[09:55:45] <dogarrhea2> yea it's still a buzzword
[09:55:48] <dogarrhea2> who uses xml these days
[09:56:29] <Ruum> dogarrhea2: if your using jquery your using ajax if your using ajax your using xml
[09:56:44] <dogarrhea2> it works that way underneath?
[09:57:28] <Ruum> phlp: hey I tried that code you gave me and it didnt work :-(
[09:59:03] <phlp> Ruum: which one?
[10:00:10] <Ruum> http://jsfiddle.net/VdVRg/
[10:00:40] <Ruum> I think there is too much else going on with the page, and its not making it happen.
[10:00:41] <multipass> is it possible to count ajax results returned, even more indepth a subset of the results?
[10:01:32] <phlp> Ruum: did you put it in $(document).ready ?
[10:01:43] <Ruum> ya.
[10:02:07] <Ruum> wait... lemme fix that.
[10:04:39] <blez> I try to set a CSS using jquery
[10:04:44] <blez> http://pastie.org/2712565 this is my css
[10:04:52] <blez> that's the jquery: http://pastie.org/2712570
[10:05:03] <blez> using colors instead of images works, but this don't
[10:05:43] <bakers> blez: This looks ok to me, have you tried a jsfiddle.net of it?
[10:05:52] <bakers> blez: Then we can modify it in real time
[10:06:52] <Ruum> phlp: lol yup it worked now!!!

[10:15:31] <dabear> solsTiCe: I thought only opera mobile supported javascript
[10:16:03] <blez> bakers it's hard to separate my css/js from the page
[10:16:03] <solsTiCe> no. well. it's rendered on the server
[10:16:31] <safzouf> any help about closure? (function($) {  ??

[10:19:10] <min|dvir|us> Hi. I need to do something instantly before form submission and instantly after form submission. Any suggestions?

[10:21:33] <`andy> how do you check if an element exists (on a loop or something?), than when it does, run a function?
[10:21:58] <`andy> are there like timers or anything for jquery?
[10:22:29] <dabear> `andy: use livequery

[10:23:24] <`andy> dabear: thanks, ill loook into it
[10:28:39] <min|dvir|us> Hi. I need to do something instantly before form submission starts (but not ends) and instantly after form submission starts (but not ends). Any suggestions?
[10:31:47] <zoned> i'm trying to send an html email and embed my stylesheet in it, is there a way i can use jquery to get css on my page and output it as a string or something?
[10:32:22] <localhost3000> hey all - in ruby how can I read the length of a video file (say, an mp4) ?
[10:33:09] <snover> localhost3000: how is that even a remotely appropriate question for this channel? :)
[10:33:41] <localhost3000> snover: am i in the wrong channel again?
[10:34:50] <localhost3000> snover: lol. sorry :)
[10:40:57] <min|dvir|us> Hi. I need to do something instantly before form submission starts (but not ends) and instantly after form submission starts (but not ends). How?
[10:45:21] <ajax_te> can some one tell me what's wrong in this?http://jsfiddle.net/nd6ft/
[10:46:37] <phlp> ajax_te: you forgot to include data as a paramter for your callback. function(data)
[10:46:52] <melkornemesis> yeap
[10:46:56] <melkornemesis> just wanted to say
[10:47:17] <ajax_te> yeah, phlp
[10:47:22] <ajax_te> thanks
[10:53:35] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: did you manage to wire that demo up with your ajax stuff?
[10:53:49] <ryanneufeld> not yet, I'm at work at the moment
[10:53:58] <gnarf> right on
[10:54:08] <ryanneufeld> I have to sort out how I want to manage the sorting though
[10:54:30] <Ruum> hey phlp listen I already have an id to work with its called : "block-menu-primary-links"
[10:54:46] <ryanneufeld> I might have to re-assign the sort value on every item
[10:55:05] <min|dvir|us> Will $(form).submit() fire my custom handler?
[10:55:17] <min|dvir|us> If so, can I stop it from doing that?
[10:55:20] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: it will trigger, yes
[10:56:13] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: yes - just make a variable in the outer scope, and if ( dontRunSubmit ) return;
[10:56:19] <min|dvir|us> That's gross.
[10:56:33] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: um, its less gross than unbinding the event
[10:56:38] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: and its like one line of code
[10:56:40] <gnarf> so
[10:56:47] <gnarf> whatever reason you think its gross
[10:57:20] <min|dvir|us> gnarf, JS submit() will not trigger an onsubmit handler.
[10:57:44] <phlp> Ruum: $('#block-menu-primary-link li:not(.last)').append('<span>|</span>');
[10:57:55] <melvinram> I'm trying to build a server side assisted grid system for jquery… http://3gd2.localtunnel.com/products on this page, can someone look and tell me why the page is not submitting the form when the fields are being pressed or menu is changed.
[10:58:14] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: then get the form and call .submit()
[10:58:38] <min|dvir|us> gnarf, thanks. :)
[10:58:59] <min|dvir|us> gnarf, how would I get the form from the submit handler? this?
[10:59:04] <ccmonster> anyone able to help with a drawer effect on jquery mobile?
[10:59:10] <ccmonster> i asked in there, but no dice me thinks
[10:59:47] <gnarf> min|dvir|us: of course?
[10:59:57] <gnarf> :)
[11:00:19] <min|dvir|us> gnarf, would that be a jQuery object, or the JS object? If I were to call this.submit(), would it be the JS submit, or the jQuery submit?
[11:00:30] <gnarf> in an event handler
[11:00:33] <gnarf> this is the dom element
[11:00:52] <min|dvir|us> gnarf, so, no jQuery, then?
[11:02:25] <Ruum> thanks phlp !!!
[11:02:45] <phlp> yep :)
[11:24:06] <Ring0`> Hi. I have <label id="lab">SomeText</label>. I used $("#lab").html("NewText"); to change it but it remains like it was. What I do wrong?
[11:24:56] <ccmonster> $('#lab').text()
[11:24:58] <ccmonster> ?
[11:25:08] <ccmonster> $('#lab').text('my new text')
[11:25:25] <ccmonster> I cannot remember what handles labels off the top of my head.
[11:25:35] <Ring0`> ccmonster: text also didn't do the trick
[11:26:24] <phlp> Ring0`: is it in $(document).ready ?
[11:26:51] <rroelofs> Ring0`: also, are you sure #lab is finding your element?
[11:27:27] <Ring0`> phlp: I saw that it blinks with "NewText" and then getting overwritten by "SomeText". I added document.ready but still getting overwritten.
[11:27:34] <Ring0`> rroelofs: yeah, as above :-)
[11:27:36] <ccmonster> console.log($('#lab')); in your console to make sure
[11:28:18] <rroelofs> Ring0`: I would expect $("#lab").html("stuff") to work.  It sounds like something is changing it back right away
[11:28:37] <tydeas> Has anybody used jquery boilerplate ? I am searching to find out how do declare a private method.
[11:29:39] <Ring0`> rroelofs: text/html does work, but it's changing back to SomeText, so yeah, there must be some other trigger
[11:30:22] <skamikaze> tydeas: google module pattern tutorial and you'll get what happens there
[11:30:52] <rroelofs> Ring0`: can you make a fiddle with a stripped down example?
[11:37:55] <tydeas> skamikaze: THe problem is quite specific that I have.
[11:38:06] <Ring0`> rroelofs: I
[11:38:12] <Ring0`> rroelofs: I'm not sure ;/
[11:38:57] <Zerpy> is there any way I can target alert(this.getTrigger().attr("fieldname")? Like getting fieldname of an form element name="Fieldname"?
[11:39:11] <khmer> tydeas: declare a private method by creating a function inside the closure and not exporting it
[11:39:13] <skamikaze> tydeas: var foo = function () { } // this one is private
[11:39:23] <skamikaze> inside the boilerplate
[11:39:40] <tydeas> skamikaze: I need to acces this.options
[11:39:49] <tydeas> for example but this differs in that occasssion.
[11:40:07] <khmer> tydeas: then pass this into the function, rather than executing it in this.context
[11:40:33] <skamikaze> tydeas: wrap object scope ( var that = this) or use Fn.bind() or use jqueryui widget factory
[11:40:56] <skamikaze> i'd go for the ui factory
[11:41:48] <rroelofs> Ring0`:  You're not sure if you can pare it down, or I didn't sufficiently explain jsfiddle ?
[11:41:57] <tydeas> skamikaze: should I return that in the end/
[11:42:00] <Zerpy> alert(this.getTrigger().attr("fieldName").val() == "controller" is that possible to do? attribute is called "fieldName" btw
[11:42:46] <skamikaze> tydeas: that's why i recommended to read a few tutorials first ;) no offense
[11:43:32] <tydeas> skamikaze: no offense
[11:43:33] <tydeas> sorry
[11:44:21] <skamikaze> tydeas: to understand the boilerplate grab that tutorial http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/10/a-plugin-development-pattern
[11:46:47] <tydeas> skamikaze: great resource
[11:51:42] <DofLeFou> Greetings
[11:52:18] <DofLeFou> I m looking for a good plugins … for Step Form Wizard
[11:52:25] <DofLeFou> any recommendation?
[11:53:29] <jo___> hello :)
[11:54:31] <jo___> im trying to put a function to my wordpress theme, i want the search input box to resize when i click on it. can someone help me?
[11:55:04] <ravenzz> DofLeFou mekwall was coding one
[11:55:17] <bitbuzzer> Give it a name or id, select it, and use css()
[11:56:51] <bitbuzzer> Put that in the click() event got the input
[11:57:00] <rroelofs> jo___: one wordpress weirdness is that you have to pass jQuery into the ready function in order to ue the $
[11:57:00] <bitbuzzer> Got= for
[12:03:06] <domino14> i created a 'select'
[12:04:33] <phlp> oh great insurance changes.. "smaller network offering better benefits" sure, sure
[12:10:12] <yedimind> keyup events with a timer, anyone have a link ?
[12:10:58] <ASUChander> If I have a browser with 2 windows open (but in the same security domain), and in Window #2 I do a $(window.opener.document).live('test-event', function() { alert('here!'); }); and then trigger the event in the first window ($(document).trigger('test-event')) the alert never occurs - can anyone explain why please?
[12:11:17] <ASUChander> Window #2 was opened by window #1 (just FYI)
[12:12:30] <ASUChander> Same issue with '.bind' as well, just FYI..
[12:12:32] <mbroadst> does anyone here use the jquery form plugin written by malsup?
[12:14:01] <necromancer> mbroadst yup
[12:15:30] <necromancer> mbroadst: what
[12:15:33] <necromancer> do you need help with?
[12:15:51] <mbroadst> necromancer: cool, maybe you can help me out.. I've got a form that is dynamically loaded into a div element, the actual page contains a script section that calls ajaxForm on the form id of the form right below it.  I'm doing all the validation server-side, so when the submit occurs JSON is returned with either success or failure+validation results
[12:16:15] <mbroadst> when you get an error back, nothing is reloaded in the div, but when I then click submit again nothing happens
[12:16:21] <alessioalex> does anybody here know a good Date-Time js library?
[12:16:59] <necromancer> alessioalex: yeah, it's called the Date object in basic javascript ;)
[12:17:03] <phlp> http://www.datejs.com
[12:17:13] <alessioalex> :))
[12:17:22] <mbroadst> weirder still, if I just put the ajaxForm stuff in a $(document).ready block, and click submit the second time it for some reason reloads the element, and I get a js error stating that $ is undefined
[12:17:40] <necromancer> mbroadst: the docs are a bit confusing, you really only need ajaxSubmit..
[12:17:52] <mbroadst> necromancer: right, well I tried that as well
[12:18:03] <mbroadst> made a function that when called does an ajaxSubmit on that form element
[12:18:04] <necromancer> i usually just do $('#form').ajaxSubmit({ <$.ajax options> });
[12:18:05] <mbroadst> same thing
[12:18:25] <mbroadst> the function is called
[12:18:31] <necromancer> is the proper JSON being returned?
[12:18:41] <mbroadst> but when it gets to ajaxSubmit the second time, the call to ajaxSubmit just does nothing
[12:18:45] <zelaz> anyone working qith jquery flot?
[12:18:50] <mbroadst> no error, no connection to the server, nothing
[12:18:56] <zelaz> I've noticed some strange behavior between version 0.6 and 0.7
[12:19:00] <necromancer> why are you submitting it twice?
[12:19:07] <zelaz> specifically with regard to drawing labels
[12:19:23] <mbroadst> necromancer: because, in my test case here, the first submit is an "error"
[12:19:41] <necromancer> mbroadst: i think you're gonna need to post your code in gist.github.com
[12:19:42] <mbroadst> so I submit the form with a value that does not validate, the response is json giving the validation errors
[12:19:57] <zelaz> is there a special channel for jquery flot maybe?
[12:19:58] <necromancer> might need a multifile gist, one for the base page and one for the ajax-loaded form
[12:20:02] <TeamColtra_Work> http://paste2.org/p/1723684 every time the "load" code is used it seems to just add on to the previous instance... in this I am loading a marquee so what happens is that the marquees are starting to overlap each other
[12:20:11] <necromancer> zelaz: if there was, it would be on the README or docs of that plugin
[12:20:16] <mbroadst> then I change that field to something that passes validation, and ajaxSubmit does nothing
[12:20:20] <TeamColtra_Work> is there an .unload type option?
[12:20:27] <necromancer> zelaz: don't expect to get help with plugins here. depends on how many people are usin git
[12:20:29] <mbroadst> necromancer: yeah thats so tough because there are a number of files involved here no?
[12:20:53] <zelaz> fair enough
[12:21:01] * zelaz expects nothing, generally
[12:21:18] <necromancer> zelaz: doesn't hurt to ask, of course
[12:21:24] <necromancer> mbroadst: you can make multifile gists. just set the filename with the proper extension so it's easy to read
[12:21:35] <necromancer> click "Add another file..." below the code paste section
[12:21:56] <starsinmypockets> why is this null? http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:22:15] <starsinmypockets> ^ http://jsfiddle.net/gkG2e/
[12:23:15] <mbroadst> necromancer: https://gist.github.com/1293509
[12:23:22] <mbroadst> thats the template and its controller
[12:23:55] <mbroadst> necromancer: if this makes sense, the template is ajax loaded into a <div> element on some page
[12:23:57] <Germanaz0> starsinmypockets, http://jsfiddle.net/gkG2e/1/ <solution
[12:23:57] <necromancer> mbroadst: i would advise you to change the name of that function before your boss sees it ;-)
[12:24:08] <necromancer> but i concur as i name all my testing files that :)
[12:24:12] <Germanaz0> is not $('#container').width();
[12:24:20] <Germanaz0> is $('#container').widht();
[12:24:29] <mbroadst> necromancer: :) I'm trying this on my personal repo, a punt for an idea at work
[12:25:40] <jbwiv> guys, when I call jQuery.getJSON and pass it a callback, I get an array or wrapped objects passed into the callback instead of the raw json results. How can I mimic this wrapping outside of these callbacks? Let's say I have a  response from getJSON, but it's not being processed in a callback?
[12:26:24] <mbroadst> necromancer: I think the main problem here is that when the "Update" button is clicked, the div is reloaded
[12:26:28] <Germanaz0> jbwiv, in which language ?
[12:26:28] <mbroadst> somehow it is
[12:26:36] <necromancer> mbroadst: makes sense, but the Python code isn't really what i'm looking for...rather the JSON that it outputs. you can find that by right-clicking the connection in the Net/Network panel of your JS debugger (Firebug for me, on Firefox...but you might use Dev Tools on Chrome or IE)
[12:26:36] <necromancer> mbroadst: but i don't really need to see that, i think you should have a look at it since you'll know if something looks odd
[12:26:45] <starsinmypockets> Germanaz0 - that's ridiculous! Object has no method widht()
[12:26:45] <domino14> is there an equivalent to $.val(value) that actually triggers the 'change' event handler?
[12:26:45] <Germanaz0> is the endpoint in php ?
[12:26:46] <mbroadst> I haven't given it a target
[12:26:48] <domino14> for a form element
[12:27:18] <jjl1> has anyone else seen jQuery.support.boxModel return false in Firefox 6?
[12:27:31] <necromancer> mbroadst: that too, but you're calling onclick improperly. you should be using event listeners
[12:27:38] <Germanaz0> so starsinmypockets why this worked for me ? http://jsfiddle.net/gkG2e/1/
[12:28:02] <savolai> how easy would it be to customize http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/ to be horizontal, or does it make sense to use custom stuff like http://www.madeincima.it/en/articles/resources-and-tools/easy-accordion-plugin/ ?
[12:28:10] <mbroadst> necromancer: you just mean $('button').click...
[12:28:13] <Germanaz0> ahh xD
[12:28:16] <starsinmypockets> Germanaz0 = this doesn't run, I get an error
[12:28:34] <phlp> Germanaz0: it doesnt say null for you because the script fails to run. starsinmypockets your id is mispelled. extra t
[12:28:37] <mbroadst> oh maybe even $('#form').submit?
[12:28:55] <necromancer> mbroadst: that's right
[12:28:56] <necromancer> mbroadst: https://gist.github.com/1293516
[12:29:49] <necromancer> mbroadst: actually overriding the submit action is a much better and easier-to-debug way of doing things. refresh https://gist.github.com/1293516
[12:29:49] <jbwiv> Germanaz0, in javascript
[12:30:29] <necromancer> mbroadst: i added a `return false` at the end of that submit action to fully prevent it from going onto the next page. clicking that button should run the ajaxSubmit but not actually submit the form through the browser (rather than through the Ajax object, which is what's happening right now)
[12:30:52] <starsinmypockets> phlp - hah - it was mispelled in the source as well... damn fingers
[12:31:01] <mbroadst> necromancer: OK, now we're back to the original error. when I click submit a second time now I'm getting "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined"
[12:31:43] <mbroadst> I can confirm that he page is still being reloaded (I'm just console.logging at the top of the template)
[12:33:23] <necromancer> mbroadst: did you say earlier that you needed to load this <script> in an ajax action?
[12:34:02] <mbroadst> necromancer: yeah I have a data tables list view on a page, and this form is loaded dynamically into a <div> on the side of the table when an item is selected
[12:34:47] <jbwiv> Germanaz0, does that make sense? I want to call "var x = jQuery.getJSON("/roles", "", {ajax:true}) and have x set to the same value that r would be set to in this call: "jQuery.getJSON("/roles", "", {ajax:true}, function(r) {})")
[12:35:39] <necromancer> jbwiv: why can't you just var x; $.getJSON([etc], function() { x = response });?
[12:35:58] <necromancer> sorry i guess that should be
[12:36:07] <necromancer> var x; $.getJSON([etc], function(r) { x = r; });?
[12:36:25] <necromancer> considering that's the way you have to do it :)
[12:36:31] <ASUChander> is there a way to make a jquery custom event work across browser windows in the same security domain?
[12:37:45] <mbroadst> necromancer: tough problem right? I've spent most of my day on it..
[12:37:56] <jbwiv> necromancer, if that's the way it has to be, so be it. Just thought it seemed odd to create a function just to set x
[12:38:53] <necromancer> mbroadst: you may be experiencing a bit of a scope issue here. in my experience, ajax-loaded inline <script> tags are unreliable
[12:39:00] <necromancer> they don't respect the libs that have been loaded on the actual page
[12:39:23] <necromancer> a LOT of the time, you can simply put this JS in the success callback method of your ajax call and it fixes the problem
[12:39:50] <necromancer> imo, whenever you can put your JS in a file and include it. just makes things a lot easier to a.) debug and b.) process by the browser
[12:40:03] <mbroadst> necromancer: well, yes I had considered that, however, it becomes very difficult to just put this in the callback of the ajax load
[12:40:13] <mbroadst> I guess I could try that
[12:40:28] <necromancer> mbroadst: what do you mean by "difficult"?
[12:41:09] <mbroadst> necromancer: well this is one of something like 15 forms, so all this could would have to be moved to some central location (because they are mostly being called from a single menu)
[12:41:32] <mbroadst> plus it "feels" right to include the logic for the view in the actual view template file
[12:43:13] <necromancer> mbroadst: when you get into complicated JS applications it's really important to segregate logic from presentation at all times
[12:43:33] <necromancer> mbroadst: consider this, right now your application requests an HTML file with JS. well that's two different formats that the browser has to process now.
[12:43:50] <necromancer> mbroadst: wouldn't it be easier if you just passed JS code or JSON back and forth?
[12:44:34] <mbroadst> maybe, except that the backend provides very nice methods to encapsulate the html "widgets" on the screen and provide validation for them
[12:44:39] <mbroadst> I guess I could serialize those to json
[12:44:55] <mbroadst> thats going to take a lot of redesign though :)
[12:48:27] <necromancer> mbroadst: from what i saw it looked like the backend simply provided a true/false resposne
[12:49:39] <mbroadst> necromancer: well that html file is actually a template, its a sort of minimal one but you can see some of the widgets being loaded in there
[12:52:03] <teamcoltra|party> http://paste2.org/p/1723684 Can someone help explain how I can end the previous "load" before loading again?
[12:52:26] <teamcoltra|party> right now this script is overlapping every time the load is executed
[12:52:45] <mbroadst> necromancer: the thing is, if I put a $(document).ready handler in the template file, it is called each time the div is loaded up
[12:53:03] <mbroadst> I just need to get it to not actually reload the div when submit is being clicked :)
[12:56:33] <mbroadst> necromancer: in fact, now that I think about it, I'm not sure moving this to a function called in the callback of the original load is going to solve anything
[12:57:26] <mbroadst> because the scope issues are occurring after the ajaxSubmit call
[12:59:42] <daveyjoe> Sometimes when I click on an element in a webkit browser it fires a mousedown and mouseup but not not a click. Anybody know why this might be?]
[13:00:09] <PrgmrBill> reticulating splines
[13:04:44] <teamcoltra|party> http://paste2.org/p/1723684 Can someone help explain how I can end the previous "load" before loading again? It doesn't seem like it should be too hard... but I haven't been able to find someone to help me with my problem
[13:07:20] <gizmore> i am trying to develope a browsergame ... should i use <canvas> ?
[13:07:33] <gizmore> (and good evening) :)
[13:11:24] <skh_> Can someone give me a pointer, when using this code, if I scroll too fast, the opacity doesn't change correctly.  Is there anyway to get around this? http://pastebin.com/PhVHfG5E
[13:13:03] <gizmore> skh_: it is probably because too much scroll events processed at once?
[13:13:38] <skh_> gizmore, that's what I'm thinking.. but I'm not feeling smart and can't think of a way to mitigate that
[13:14:02] <gizmore> you could maybe use a setTimeout()
[13:14:10] <gizmore> and kill all timeouts when assigning the current
[13:14:25] <razzi> teamcoltra|party, something like http://paste2.org/p/1723770
[13:14:58] <gizmore> skh_:  like cancelTimeout(t); t = setTimeout(); ... so only one and the very last event will be processed, when scrolling is idle for lets say 300ms
[13:17:45] <teamcoltra|party> razzi: thank you, can you explain what "foo" is supposed to be substituted for?
[13:18:01] <teamcoltra|party> The div as well?
[13:18:24] <devinrolsen> afternoon all.
[13:18:50] <zelaz> that's the callback function, I think ( teamcoltra|party )
[13:19:08] <phlp> skh_: remove the if? when the scroll is > 100 then it wont do anything
[13:20:43] <razzi> teamcoltra|party it's the name of the function
[13:23:21] <skh_> phlp, hmm, yeah, that certainly works.. fires off the css change more times than required tho, is there any disadvantage to that?
[13:24:47] <discountrobot> Guys. im currently fiddling with some MouseEvents.
[13:25:00] <discountrobot> and Chrome picks up toElement just fine
[13:25:11] <discountrobot> but FF and IE wont
[13:25:33] <skh_> phlp, I'll just put in some conditionals.  Should probably stop working, not thinking too clear =)
[13:25:39] <skh_> thanks phlp  and gizmore
[13:25:50] <gizmore> yw :)
[13:26:12] <phlp> skh_: well if you limit the scroll events like gizmore suggested then i wouldnt worry about it. look at this http://ejohn.org/blog/learning-from-twitter
[13:27:03] <gizmore> anyone got a suggestion for me? (i want to create a browser game and wonder if i should use <canvas> for the minimap) anything else that could be used?
[13:28:30] <gizmore> or is it too early for the canvas object? :P
[13:29:32] <skh_> phlp, great reference, thx.
[13:35:42] <impi> hello, i can see my html updated after a ajax call, but when i view source my old element (input values of the form) is still in the source, and the new one isn't, so when i hit submit my form post the first values before the ajax call
[13:36:02] <impi> is there a way i can remedy this?
[13:36:39] <necromancer> gizmore: depends on what browsers you want to support
[13:36:55] <shiryu> Hi, this is my code: http://pastebin.com/H02KVbV3 -- .toggle() works like a charm but any input fields in the children can no longer be checked. Any ideas?
[13:37:00] <shiryu> This is because of the return false;
[13:37:03] <necromancer> gizmore: HTML5 is best run on the most modern browsers, like IE9+
[13:37:06] <gizmore> necromancer: the latest versions should be enough ... like opera11, ff7, IE9
[13:37:22] <necromancer> yeah you should be ok
[13:37:30] <necromancer> gizmore: you doing this in pure JS or are you using a framework?
[13:37:31] <gizmore> ok thank you :)
[13:37:44] <gizmore> pure JS / Jquery ... some "own" framework
[13:37:57] <gizmore> basicall i just need to draw some cells, a few units, some popups
[13:38:28] <gizmore> so i think i don't need a fancy 2d js game framework
[13:38:31] <necromancer> oh ok
[13:38:46] <gizmore> as there is no collisions for example
[13:38:56] <necromancer> well if you need it there's http://gamejs.org/, that's a nice lightweight one
[13:39:04] <gizmore> ok, thanks again :)
[13:39:07] <necromancer> or perhaps http://gamequery.onaluf.org/ :)
[13:39:49] <gizmore> thank you! :)
[13:41:14] <gizmore> gamejs looks ok for my needs ... the gamequery looks way to poweful for me :)
[13:52:36] <falieson> can someone take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/WRCXv/ the show() isn't working
[13:58:34] <phlp> falieson: http://jqfundamentals.com/#chapter-5
[14:03:05] <Camer0n123> why isnt this zoom wokring on the large phone img?
[14:03:06] <Camer0n123> http://www.scratchdummy.com/brand/182
[14:03:15] <Camer0n123> Object #<Object> has no method 'loupe'
[14:03:59] <falieson> phlp: what am I supposed to be looking for in this doc?
[14:04:52] <phlp> falieson: how to attach an event handler. yours is completely wrong
[14:08:28] <Camer0n123> anyone?
[14:09:19] <phlp> Camer0n123: you have a second jquery.js loading after you load the loupe script
[14:09:26] <Camer0n123> oh
[14:15:54] <Aquaguy> Hey there
[14:16:32] <Aquaguy> is there any way to get from an jquery object containing a butnch of text inputs the one with 'foo' id?
[14:16:47] <Aquaguy> something like inputs.get('#foo') or something
[14:17:05] <mmmmbacon> has anyone ever had problems using append in ie?
[14:17:23] <bakers> mmmmbacon: append?
[14:17:24] <phlp> ? filter @ Aquaguy
[14:17:25] <bot-t> Aquaguy, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:17:53] <Aquaguy> phlp, great! thank you so much!
[14:17:56] <mmmmbacon> $("#date").append(new Option(value, value));
[14:17:56] <mmmmbacon>  doesnt seem to work in ie versions < 9
[14:18:07] <mmmmbacon> it works fine in firefox obviously,and safari
[14:18:31] <bakers> mmmmbacon: No I haven't... can you mock something up in jsfiddle.net
[14:18:58] <discountrobot> anyone here a ninja to mouseEvents?
[14:20:04] <bakers> discountrobot: What's your question?
[14:23:13] <mmmmbacon> http://jsfiddle.net/pJYwt/1/
[14:23:15] <mmmmbacon> for example
[14:24:26] <blez> I'm trying to make a listview
[14:24:40] <blez> but when I add many elements it lags
[14:25:45] <mmmmbacon> any idea why that doesnt work?
[14:25:50] <Krinkle> mmmmbacon: That has nothing to do with jQuery or .append
[14:25:59] <phlp> blez: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/03/43439-reasons-to-use-append-correctly
[14:26:35] <Krinkle> mmmmbacon: Option is a native constructor extending the Element object constructor. Not all browsers expose this publicly (such as <IE9)
[14:26:57] <mmmmbacon> ah ok
[14:27:09] <Krinkle> mmmmbacon: Use $('<option>')
[14:27:25] <mmmmbacon> thx
[14:27:27] <blez> http://pastie.org/2714085
[14:27:28] <blez> that's my code
[14:28:03] <blez> and my css: http://pastie.org/2714090
[14:28:17] <Krinkle> mmmmbacon: also, you're self closing + closing the same element
[14:28:20] <Krinkle> <foo /> </foo>
[14:28:29] <Krinkle> either use <foo /> or <foo></foo> not <foo /></foo>
[14:29:11] <phlp> blez: instead of binding events to every item you append look at .delegate http://api.jquery.com/delegate
[14:29:40] <Krinkle> mmmmbacon: http://jsfiddle.net/pJYwt/3/
[14:31:38] <blez> phlp it currently works, but it lags on many elements, will .delegate fix this?
[14:33:16] <phlp> blez: cant say for sure since i dont have all your code but it will definitely be an improvement
[14:34:58] <phlp> blez: you can also use :hover in css which will be faster
[14:36:14] <fogggg> I have an issue with jquery ui.. I have a page with a .live binding to open a dialog, and in that dialog theres an option to open another dialog. When the first dialog is opened only everything works fine, but once the second dialog opens, all the .live events on the original page stop working. Any ideas why that might happen?
[14:36:42] <fogggg> no html is changed on the original page\
[14:36:53] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here recommend jsdoc toolkit or perhaps a better alternative?
[14:37:18] <ProLoser|Work> i find it strange that newlines and carriage returns aren't preserved, nor does it inflect 'namespace' based on closures
[14:38:40] <phlp> fogggg: heres my idea http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false
[14:39:25] <blez> phlp interesting, is it possible to do all the stuff only with css?
[14:41:26] <phlp> blez: there's also :active which is for when the mouse is down on the element
[14:41:56] <blez> I'm more interested at mousedown/click
[14:42:05] <blez> is therea an css event for that?
[14:42:23] <blez> there a*
[14:43:28] <zelaz> anyone around that's worked with jquery flot plugin?
[14:43:49] <zelaz> I'm having some strange behaviour modifying ticks in 0.7
[14:43:50] <phlp> blez: no. they are more like states than events
[14:44:20] <zelaz> it worked properly in 0.6, but for some reason now it looks like it's not looking at tick information from the ticks property when the axis labels are drawn
[14:45:30] <blez> phlp and how is this thing called in the web world? it's not listview
[14:46:00] <blez> http://i51.tinypic.com/dfbktz.png
[14:47:23] <phlp> blez: doesnt really have a name unless you use a ui library. should probably use the ul tag instead of divs which is unordered list
[14:48:08] <blez> maybe I should look up for an image option button
[14:50:19] <fogggg> phlp hrm I read that and it seems possible that its the case but the problem is theres no return false statement in the code for the 2nd dialog
[14:53:02] <fogggg> is there some way i can just put code in the close method of the 2nd dialog to just redo all the bindings of the page? seems like a crappy fix but at this point ill take it\
[14:54:11] <sadmicrowave> anyone know of another json string tester other than JSONLint to verify my json string?
[14:54:54] <phlp> fogggg: what are the live events for?
[14:55:41] <fogggg> click on spans on the page
[14:56:21] <yedimind> hey, iu have a #content container around everything of mine, how do i unwrap all my content and remove the #content container ?
[14:56:40] <fogggg> the 2nd dialog that breaks them doesnt even do anything really, just opening and closing it without it running anymore code causes all the live events to break
[14:56:50] <eddiemonge> snover: could i setup SimpleHTTPServer to serve an index.py file as the default instead of an index.php or index.html?
[14:57:02] <phlp> fogggg: have you tried delegate instead? http://api.jquery.com/delegate
[14:57:11] <fogggg> yeah same result
[14:57:24] <fogggg> works until the 2nd dialog opens
[14:58:05] <fogggg> i really dont get it.. they are just very basic jquery ui dialogs
[14:58:16] <phlp> is it a modal dialog?
[14:58:21] <fogggg> ya
[14:58:43] <phlp> are the spans inside the dialog?
[14:59:05] <snover> eddiemonge: ummm. why would I know that? what is simplehttpserver? :)
[14:59:15] <fogggg> nope
[14:59:26] <phlp> then you cant click them. that's the point of a modal dialog
[14:59:34] <fogggg> after the dialog is closed i mean
[14:59:38] <fogggg> they no longer work
[14:59:45] <fogggg> when both dialogs are closed
[14:59:59] <yedimind> if i have <div id="content"> [multiple child elements here] </div> whats the best way to unwrap all those child elements and get rid of #content
[15:00:40] <phlp> fogggg: hmm i dont know. maybe put it on jsfiddle.net so its easier to help
[15:02:06] <eddiemonge> snover: you know everything! i have yet to ask you something you dont know
[15:02:53] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> is it possible to use <td> tags on the same row to radio buttons?
[15:06:02] <solidus-river> what's the difference between extend and extend --deep?
[15:06:20] <solidus-river> i want to make a copy of an img element that is not at all linked to the current dom element
[15:06:32] <solidus-river> because i then want to remove the origin and replace it with something else and still have the image element available to me
[15:06:45] <solidus-river> however as i'm doing it now (tried with extend and clone) the image element gets deleted
[15:06:49] <fogggg> ah i just realized its not the 2nd dialog thats breaking the events, its the context menu plugin im using to bring it up. crap
[15:06:56] <eddiemonge> yedimind: $('#content').find('> *').appendTo( $('#content').parent() ).end().remove();  might do it
[15:07:19] <juha_> yo
[15:16:11] <imsky> this is a journey into sound
[15:20:03] <m8597> hola
[15:21:04] <initself> I want to run a test on JSFiddle of some google api stuff.
[15:21:07] <initself> Here's what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/eBtDz/
[15:21:22] <initself> What do I need it to look like to work?
[15:21:36] <initself> can you run external scripts on jsfiddle?
[15:22:39] <yedimind> http://kangax.github.com/nfe/
[15:22:43] <yedimind> good read for all you kids
[15:31:43] <falieson>                 $("filter-item").hover(addClass('filter-item-hover),removeClass('filter-item-hover')); every item here is a class, whta am I doing wrong?
[15:32:31] <imsky> filter-item is not a real selector
[15:32:35] <imsky> use .filter-item
[15:32:53] <falieson> yeah, i tried that first, but same problem
[15:38:57] <sadmicrowave> I'm trying to do a simple dynamic array creation much like I would in php but javascript keeps giving me an error saying: aCategories[ e.desc ] is undefined.  http://pastebin.com/abg9Qr0v
[15:39:16] <sadmicrowave> how do I do this same type of array/element creation in js
[15:39:17] <sadmicrowave> ?
[15:41:45] <imsky> falieson: you're also doing the hover callback wrong
[15:41:59] <draginx> If Im setting an img to width:100%; and having CSS scale the height on it's own how do I get that height?
[15:42:14] <imsky> $("img").height() draginx
[15:42:29] <falieson> imsky: yeah,  i figured it out - thanks
[15:42:33] <draginx> imsky: that did NOT work =/
[15:42:39] <draginx> console.log shows "0"
[15:42:45] <imsky> draginx: did you substitute your img selector for "img"?
[15:42:52] <draginx> uhh yes
[15:42:55] <draginx> #main_pic img
[15:42:56] <romankrv> Hi. I have question please help me:   I have code: http://dpaste.com/636187/ and One needs via jquery added block  <div class="caption preview"> Three </div> like in attach dpaste    How it do?
[15:42:59] <draginx> .length = 1
[15:43:43] <imsky> draginx: something's broken on your end
[15:43:46] <draginx> nope
[15:43:49] <imsky> mmm yep
[15:43:57] <sadmicrowave> lol
[15:44:06] <draginx> http://cripplewars.com/charles/top.html see?
[15:44:10] <imsky> let me take a look
[15:44:20] <imsky> yeah i get 593
[15:44:23] <imsky> as an alert
[15:44:26] <imsky> is that what that is?
[15:44:29] <draginx> http://cripplewars.com/charles/file.js
[15:44:38] <draginx> no it says 0 for me in chrome
[15:44:45] <imsky> broken-o-rama
[15:44:56] <draginx> So jquery is broken
[15:44:57] <draginx> weird
[15:45:02] <imsky> ah
[15:45:06] <imsky> i might know why
[15:45:20] <imsky> chrome's being sneaky, it's getting the image object before it loads
[15:45:33] <draginx> right but its caling "ready" beforehand?
[15:45:33] <imsky> so that'll lead to good ol 0-height
[15:45:39] <imsky> well
[15:45:43] <imsky> let me do a quick check
[15:46:00] <imsky> yep
[15:46:00] <romankrv> no answer for me?
[15:46:08] <imsky> if i run $('#main_pic img').height(); in chrome console after it loads, it gets 592
[15:46:16] <imsky> so you just have a synchronicity problem
[15:46:25] <imsky> you need imagesLoaded or .load or something
[15:46:29] <imsky> ?g imagesLoaded @ draginx
[15:46:30] <bot-t> draginx, imagesLoaded() jquery plugin  Gist - https://gist.github.com/268257
[15:46:31] <draginx> I mean if there's a way to just position that white text to the bottom of the image without JS that would be even better..
[15:46:38] <draginx> i need to dl a fucking plugin for this?
[15:46:39] <draginx> lmao
[15:46:41] <sadmicrowave>  I'm trying to do a simple dynamic array creation much like I would in php but javascript keeps giving me an error saying: aCategories[ e.desc ] is undefined.  http://pastebin.com/abg9Qr0v
[15:46:51] <imsky> draginx: use css and abs pos
[15:47:18] <draginx> imsky: tried that
[15:47:20] <draginx> using top:90%;
[15:47:23] <draginx> bottom:0;, etc.
[15:48:05] <imsky> hmm now that i think about it, without a predefined height, this is way too complicated
[15:48:14] <draginx> correct
[15:48:21] <imsky> so do the less complicated thing :)
[15:48:24] <draginx> and of course the client cant have this any other way
[15:48:26] <draginx> nope cant
[15:48:28] <draginx> cause client is a jew
[15:48:35] <imsky> alright bud, take her easy
[15:48:54] <ShaunR> Is there a standard to the type response i should use for AJAX.  For example, returning somthing like 'status' = 'success', 'message' = 'Successful Operation', 'data' = array?
[15:49:10] <draginx> imsky: sorry been trying to deal with this problem for quite some time
[15:49:32] <imsky> sadmicrowave: when you log the variable e, what do you get?
[15:49:40] <ShaunR> I'm basically going to be submit data via ajax and need to show an error if there was an error (and allow the user to fix) or show a success message with some data.
[15:49:56] <imsky> draginx: get imagesLoaded, it'll solve it for you. firefox does this fine, you just need to adjust for chrome
[15:50:02] <Elephant> ShaunR: JSON is a format you can use, but you would still need to have your own error codes/messages/
[15:50:04] <sadmicrowave> imsky, each instance of my object include desc and several other elements
[15:50:15] <imsky> sadmicrowave: just copy and paste plox
[15:50:15] <draginx> imsky: yer ill just use that thanks
[15:50:24] <ShaunR> Elephant: I plan to use json, i was meaning if there was a standard response structure
[15:50:36] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[15:50:39] <imsky> o hallo dare
[15:50:40] <Elephant> eh, it's whatever fits best for the project.
[15:50:52] <ProLoser|Work> ANYONE IN SF LOOKING FOR A JOB?
[15:51:05] <imsky> ONLY THE OCCUPY PEOPLE
[15:51:10] <ProLoser|Work> occupy people?
[15:51:17] <Elephant> I'm using {status_code: X, error_msg: ''
[15:51:19] <Elephant> }
[15:51:26] <Elephant> atm
[15:51:35] <imsky> ProLoser|Work: http://occupysf.com/
[15:51:46] <Elephant> so, 0 and '' for complete

[15:52:16] <ProLoser|Work> i really don't get the point about marching about how shit sucks
[15:52:23] <ProLoser|Work> i don't know what it is supposed to accomplish
[15:52:54] <sadmicrowave> imsky, http://pastebin.com/8uBXXZBz
[15:53:01] <imsky> sadmicrowave: in the future use gist :)
[15:53:31] <imsky> sadmicrowave: is that a verbatim paste or did you clean it up?
[15:54:09] <sadmicrowave> imsky, all I did was add colons between the element name and content for viewing
[15:54:23] <imsky> i don't see any commas
[15:54:27] <sadmicrowave> colons
[15:54:33] <imsky> is this json
[15:54:36] <imsky> or something else
[15:54:45] <ProLoser|Work> If you're interested in a good UI job in Burlingame, send me a message
[15:54:52] <sadmicrowave> imsky, json
[15:55:15] <imsky> doesn't look like it
[15:55:25] <imsky> also, wut: aCategories[ e['desc'] ]
[15:55:32] <imsky> your index is a string?
[15:56:24] <sadmicrowave> what are you talking about?
[15:56:33] <sadmicrowave> e.desc?
[15:58:01] <imsky> ok bro
[15:58:08] <imsky> go to http://jsonlint.com
[15:58:10] <imsky> and paste your json there
[15:58:15] <imsky> and paste it somewhere for me to see
[15:58:22] <imsky> if json lint says your data is not json, it's right
[15:58:39] <sadmicrowave> k hold on
[16:00:03] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: as in bay area?
[16:02:28] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[16:02:39] <ProLoser|Work> i commute from nopa
[16:09:32] <sadmicrowave> imsky, before I go any further can you just tell me if I'm doing the element creation properly? aside from invalid json...
[16:09:59] <eddiemonge> ProLoser|Work: i live in martinez and work in oakland
[16:10:24] <imsky> sadmicrowave: so it is invalid json ;)
[16:10:48] <sadmicrowave> imsky, no I haven't found the invalid part yet, I'm just wondering if what I'm doing is right...
[16:11:08] <imsky> sadmicrowave: well, it looks like some super slow code, and unless the values you set aren't already 0, it's not hard to see why they're seen as undefined
[16:12:08] <sadmicrowave> but e.desc shows a string in console when I log it so it stands to reason that aCategories[ e.desc ] would create an element inside aCategories with the same string
[16:12:50] <imsky> ehh it might, you're just hoping this works
[16:12:54] <imsky> the problem is this, though
[16:12:57] <imsky> aCategories[ e['desc'] ]['drilldown']['categories'][ e['compnt'] ]['count'] += 1;
[16:13:14] <sadmicrowave> imsky, just finished the validation and it is valid json
[16:13:23] <imsky> well i don't see any json, just some formatted data
[16:13:31] <sadmicrowave> no I'm getting an error on the first line not the second
[16:13:44] <imsky> right, well is ['y'] defined?
[16:13:55] <sadmicrowave> error on aCategories[ e['desc'] ]['y'] += 1;
[16:14:15] <imsky> that's what i'm asking
[16:14:18] <imsky> is it defined before hand
[16:14:34] <sadmicrowave> no :/ I thought it would auto start at 0
[16:14:59] <imsky> ?js var x = {}; x.y += 1;
[16:14:59] <bot-t> imsky: NaN
[16:15:08] <sadmicrowave> indeed
[16:15:10] <sadmicrowave> damn
[16:15:37] <sadmicrowave> hold on though, the error is "aCategories[ e.desc ] is not defined" ... nothing about 'y' yet
[16:15:57] <chovy> using jquery-ui's draggable library, how do I dynamically make something draggable? (ie: after an element has been added to the dom with an ajax call, I want to make it draggable).
[16:16:02] <imsky> console.log e.desc, sadmicrowave
[16:16:14] <sadmicrowave> "ELECTICALLY DEFECTIVE"
[16:16:22] <chovy> i already have the class defined as draggable, but it only works for items that were original to the page.
[16:16:23] <sadmicrowave> gives that string
[16:16:37] <imsky> sadmicrowave: ok so does aCategories have a key of "ELECTRICALLY DEFECTIVE"?
[16:16:44] <imsky> or rather, property
[16:17:27] <sadmicrowave> no, not at the time this executes, I"m trying to make the property "ELECTRICALLY DEFECTIVE" on the fly as I iterate through my loop
[16:17:34] <imsky> :(
[16:17:58] <imsky> you are paddling in a boat falling out of a helicopter that's crashing into an iceberg, hoping you can make it in time
[16:18:38] <sadmicrowave> ok, my original question was how to dynamically create array elements with variables
[16:18:46] <sadmicrowave> clearly I'm doing it wrong
[16:18:53] <sadmicrowave> but whats the proper way?
[16:19:11] <imsky> ##javascript bro
[16:20:07] <sadmicrowave> really? your neck deep in this question and you can easily provide 1 line to solve this issue and you transfer to another room
[16:20:26] <imsky> sigh
[16:20:38] <imsky> you're using two indices and you want both of them to exist
[16:20:49] <imsky> i mean you're getting it wrong like 3 levels deep
[16:21:03] <coldhead> harsh, imsky
[16:21:08] <imsky> you need to look at your data structure and then go from there
[16:21:15] <coldhead> sadmicrowave: you're*

[16:34:41] <coldhead> and sultan of my loins
[16:34:46] <abjorn> well, i guess it could technically, since you can make python scripts for ahk, but that wouldn't make ANY sense

[16:47:35] <abjorn> im wearing an xkcd shirt right now
[16:47:37] <imsky> mostly it's just mopey "isn't the universe wonderful" stuff now
[16:47:37] <abjorn> i forgot about that
[16:47:45] <abjorn> not really
[16:47:45] <imsky> or "relationships are hard"
[16:47:46] <abjorn> it was for awhile
[16:47:52] <abjorn> he stopped though
[16:47:57] <imsky> hmm let me check the latest
[16:48:00] <abjorn> probably cause people were like "wtf are you up to bro"
[16:48:11] <abjorn> i think it's cause he got married or something
[16:48:26] <imsky> oh...ok...some anime/manga reference and then a science reference, and some snarky dialogue
[16:48:29] <imsky> good ol randall

[16:48:56] <abjorn> http://xkcd.com/963/ best one in awhile
[16:49:01] <abjorn> yeah sometimes
[16:49:29] <imsky> lol
[16:49:30] <abjorn> everytime I try and do anything in xorg.conf i get pissed off
[16:49:32] <abjorn> so pissed off

[16:49:41] <imsky> is my solution
[16:49:43] <abjorn> rofl
[16:49:46] <abjorn> like
[16:49:51] <abjorn> if you want to use multiple monitors
[16:49:54] <abjorn> it's practically required
[16:49:59] <imsky> orly?
[16:50:00] <abjorn> PLUG N PLAY MONITORS? NOPE
[16:50:04] <abjorn> WHO NEEDS THAT LOL
[16:50:05] <imsky> yeah linux is broken
[16:50:16] <imsky> lot of butthurt these days about gnome3 too
[16:50:21] <abjorn> yeah
[16:50:25] <abjorn> still beats the hell outta KDE though
[16:50:31] <imsky> xfce/lxde baby
[16:50:39] <imsky> and for pure leetness, twm/dwm/awesome
[16:51:17] <imsky> also, browse your webternets with w3m to feel like keanu reeves from the matrix
[16:51:25] <abjorn> lol
[16:51:34] <imsky> i actually do that for HN
[16:51:40] <imsky> screw wasting battery power on firefox
[16:51:53] <abjorn> lolll
[16:53:45] <abjorn> i wanna learn Go but im so lazy
[16:54:21] <imsky> y
[16:54:37] <abjorn> because it seems neat
[16:56:26] <abjorn> Seems nice to have a modern compile systems programming language that doesn't force you to overly abstract everything like Java and doesn't have OOP features that are in no way orthogonal with the C features, like C++.
[16:56:36] <imsky> ...D?
[16:56:50] <abjorn> NO ONE USES D
[16:57:07] <imsky> :(
[16:57:15] <imsky> well fewer people use go :P
[16:57:18] <LuckyBambu> I have a dashboard page with about 7 different divs that I need to fill with data via asynchronous requests... what's the best way to do this? Not trying to have 7 GETs run every 5 seconds
[16:57:32] <abjorn> probably
[16:57:45] <abjorn> butbutbutbut ken thompson and rob pike made Go ;(
[16:57:58] <abjorn> stands for...something? I guess
[16:58:17] <abjorn> I also like the built in concurrency primitives based on passing messages instead of the shared-memory model
[16:58:22] <imsky> that digital mars dude who wrote the badass C compilers wrote D
[16:58:32] <imsky> so i mean, it's not like either language is made by tards
[16:58:45] <imsky> D is just not marginally more useful than C++, that's all
[16:58:55] <abjorn> lol
[16:59:15] <imsky> also if you like passing messages
[16:59:16] <imsky> bro, erlang
[16:59:23] <imsky> way more used than go, and fun to program in
[16:59:25] <abjorn> of course I also like that Go has some functional-ish features, like first-class functions and closures
[16:59:26] <falieson> how do I stick a div to the bottom of the window? I figured position: absolute; bottom: 0; would do it.. but when i scroll the div stays where it is
[16:59:35] <abjorn> yeah I know I know
[16:59:36] <abjorn> I just
[16:59:39] <abjorn> can't get used to erlang
[16:59:47] <imsky> it's just functional programming
[16:59:52] <imsky> do you know scheme or lisp or clojure?
[16:59:56] <abjorn> scheme
[17:00:00] <abjorn> some
[17:00:01] <imsky> so...should be no problem
[17:00:06] <abjorn> never written anything significant with scheme
[17:00:15] <imsky> dude, Wings3D is written in erlang
[17:00:20] <imsky> a widely used 3d modelling app
[17:00:29] <abjorn> I know
[17:00:31] <imsky> it's like writing a raytracer in perl, but it's done
[17:00:34] <abjorn> I have nothing against erlang
[17:00:48] <abjorn> erlang is nice and gets some really fuckin impressive results
[17:01:18] <abjorn> http://i.imgur.com/38UZp.jpg lol
[17:03:04] <abjorn> http://learnyousomeerlang.com/ JavaScript should have one of these "For Great Good!" tutorials
[17:03:08] <abjorn> erlang and haskell have em ;(
[17:03:48] <imsky> javascript isn't nerdy enough
[17:03:52] <imsky> language of the people and all
[17:03:59] <imsky> that's why there's no "learn you a php"

[17:06:49] <catcher> Hi everyone, I'm using the tooltip from here: http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tooltip/any-html.html...   I need to make the entire tooltip linkable (not just the text) - what's the best route there?
[17:07:44] <imsky> abjorn: check out the pencil-drawn cloud
[17:07:56] <abjorn> rofl
[17:09:25] <coldhead> catcher: $('.tooltip').live('click', function () { ... })
[17:09:49] <coldhead> m00nkfish: that is sad
[17:09:52] <zensei> Hey guys. I am trying to create an object with an initializer, like this: var img = $(document.createElement("img"), { src: url }); and then appending it to a div. Allthough, when using this approach instead of doing $('<img src="' + url + '"/>');, it doesn't work. Any ideas?
[17:11:15] <catcher> coldhead, thank you kindly! Any suggestions for what to read to understand what that does?
[17:11:52] <coldhead> ?live @ catcher
[17:11:52] <bot-t> catcher, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[17:12:15] <coldhead> the reason you use live is because that tooltip item might not exist on the page when you define it
[17:12:42] <coldhead> so live says "yo, just a headups, if you later see a tooltip element and somone clicks on it, here's what we're gonna do"
[17:13:04] <coldhead> the non-live form for comparison is see ?bind
[17:13:04] <bot-t> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[17:13:11] <catcher> coldhead, That makes sense, thank you. So the $('.tooltip') attaches it to all elements with that classname?
[17:13:53] <coldhead> yes
[17:13:58] <coldhead> m00nkfish: https://github.com/medihack/massanimate
[17:14:11] <coldhead> haven't tried that but it sounds worth a shot
[17:15:33] <Axsuul> Say I have these tags... var tags = "<ul><li>..</li><li>...</li></ul>", how would I apply jQuery selectors to it?
[17:15:34] <zensei> Anyone who know the issue with the line I posted?
[17:16:23] <catcher> coldhead, so now I need to define a function that sends the user to the location?
[17:16:59] <coldhead> catcher: yup, window.location = 'whatever'; where i have ... should do it
[17:17:38] <coldhead> Axsuul: $('ul'), $('ul li'), $('ul li:nth(2)') etc
[17:18:23] <catcher> coldhead, awesome. The link is dynamically generated, so my goal is to select the href contents of an <a> element, yes?
[17:18:27] <Axsuul> coldhead: but my tags aren't part of the DOM
[17:18:39] <Axsuul> coldhead: its a string
[17:19:00] <coldhead> zensei: the {attr: val} trick you're trying only works where you have $('some html'), jquery doesn't know how to work with Image objects
[17:19:01] <imsky> $(tags)
[17:19:08] <imsky> instant DOM manipulation
[17:19:36] <coldhead> try var x = new Image(); x.src = whatever; $(x).appendTo('whatever') instead
[17:19:51] <coldhead> or $('<img />', {etc}) as imsky is suggesting
[17:20:19] <coldhead> catcher: yes, you can just determine 'whatever' dynamically
[17:20:24] <botfather> guys can i plant a bot in here todo logging ? i am busy writing a markov plugin that i can teach the log files to
[17:20:30] <coldhead> try your best and we'll help get it running if you get stuck
[17:20:48] <zensei> Hi coldhead
[17:20:50] <coldhead> botfather: you can if it's silent and the logs aren't indexable by google
[17:20:59] <botfather> ok cool
[17:21:07] <zensei> according to a jsPerf.com performance test, it should be working with document.createElement
[17:21:17] <zensei> See this: http://jsperf.com/create-element-with-attributes-jquery-1-4-object-vs-att/3 <- last test
[17:21:22] <botfather> sorry
[17:21:25] <botfather> wrong bots
[17:21:27] <botfather> !part
[17:21:31] <coldhead> zensei: i don't see how it couldd because new Image and <img> are different things
[17:21:33] <catcher> coldhead, so helpful, thank you!
[17:21:39] <jsonbot> leaving #jquery chan
[17:21:40] <Axsuul> imsky: ah were you referring to me?
[17:21:58] <Axsuul> I think i found my solution
[17:22:04] <botfather> this is supposed to be my quiet one ;]
[17:22:16] <botfather> also runs in #appengine
[17:22:23] <Axsuul> $('ul', $('<ul><li>..</li><li>...</li></ul>'));
[17:23:05] <zensei> coldhead: That's interesting, I never though of the two as two different things.
[17:23:20] <botfather> 'chan-silent
[17:23:23] <zensei> Allthough, the jsPerf link I sent you, the span seemed to work, so I auto assumed that img would work.
[17:23:37] <botfather> !chan-silent
[17:23:37] <gaemonitor> putting #jquery to silent mode
[17:24:31] <imsky> can anybody read me
[17:24:34] <imsky> hello hello
[17:24:35] <juha_> no
[17:24:35] <snover> no

[17:24:42] <snover> o hey juha_
[17:24:43] <botfather> hehe
[17:24:43] <coldhead> i love that it loudly announces that it's going silent
[17:24:53] <coldhead> botfather: what are you markov chaining for?
[17:24:55] <snover> coldhead: I LOVE THAT YOU LOVE THAT
[17:24:57] <juha_> snover: i have issues reading your messages

[17:25:29] <imsky> !chan-party
[17:25:33] <imsky> come on
[17:25:36] <imsky> you gotta have that
[17:25:49] <snover> twelve amigos blondie righteous literal piano grape!
[17:26:02] <botfather> my dream is that every human on the planet runs his/her/its own bot that he can teach what he thinks is important
[17:26:07] <coldhead> mmm literal
[17:26:08] <juha_> is this the lemon party?
[17:26:16] <coldhead> good luck with THAT, botfather
[17:26:26] <snover> botfather: those are called “children”
[17:26:38] <botfather> yeah i know ambitious
[17:26:58] <botfather> in the real world im a schizofrenic who thinks he is god ;]
[17:27:09] <imsky> joseph
[17:27:12] <imsky> fritzl?
[17:27:13] <coldhead> i'm not sayiing that your project will end in madness, botfather, i'm just saying that everyone who attempts it goes mad
[17:27:25] <juha_> this is sparta
[17:27:27] <botfather> true thing http://tinyurl.com/bart-thate ;]
[17:27:47] <snover> coldhead: bling bling potato see of?
[17:27:54] <botfather> coldhead: i am mad and i am attempting ;]
[17:28:05] <coldhead> botfather: you're proud of it! it might just work
[17:28:22] <botfather> see http://jsonbot.org:10102 it uses tornado .. gonna hook jquery on it for the front end
[17:28:23] <coldhead> i will try to corrupt your databases with nonsense
[17:28:27] <botfather> hehe
[17:28:33] <botfather> ow wait need to enable logging
[17:28:36] <botfather> last command ;]
[17:28:39] <botfather> !chatlog-on
[17:29:16] <juha_> for anyone who is logging this channel to mysql, all i have to say is '; drop database default;
[17:29:33] <botfather> i bought the javascript definite guide from oreilly and read the chapter on jQuery
[17:29:42] <botfather> love the stuff from what i read ;]
[17:29:52] <juha_> botfather: what, jquery is javascript?
[17:30:18] <botfather> juha_: trolling expert ?
[17:30:46] <botfather> sorry im new here so i dont know anybody around ;]
[17:30:48] <juha_> botfather: expert in experting
[17:31:57] <zensei> hmm.. is there a sleep command in javascript/jQuery?
[17:32:03] <zensei> like c# Thread.Sleep()?
[17:32:20] <botfather> coldhead: bot can also do rss feeds so if you ever want to hook up stuff let me know (commit messages form posts etc) .. might get to noisy maybe though its quality noise then ;]
[17:33:04] <juha_> zensei: not by default. what you can do is use setTimeout or check out some sleep plugins
[17:33:21] <zensei> juha_: Allright, thank you ;)
[17:33:40] <juha_> zensei: just google "jquery sleep plugin" and there will be bunch of results
[17:33:53] <catcher> coldhead, should I give my links an ID so I can get the right link specifically? They have classes, which I'm trying to use in my selector, but I'm getting back [object object]
[17:34:21] <zensei> Ok. Why I am asking, is that I prefer exerienced peoples opinions like this rather than just google. I find it a lot better some times
[17:34:54] <zensei> Why I am asking is that I am dynamically loading in some images, and i want them to fade in with a little bit of delay between them, to create a "neat effect"
[17:34:58] <juha_> this is how i feel most of the time: http://imgur.com/gallery/DDmQZ
[17:35:13] <mekapses> Hey…. I have a jQuery click handler to make clickable rows in tables. Everything works fine except if i put a window.open() or window.location in the success function, it dies with an "uncaught exception" error. Any ideas?
[17:36:19] <juha_> zensei: then you should be using setTimeout
[17:36:54] <zensei> right, I am aware of the setTimeout, was just exploring alternatives :)
[17:37:03] <rgr> what do you mean by a little bit of time between them? Explain more.
[17:37:19] <zensei> rgr: Let's say you have 8 images.
[17:37:34] <zensei> and they are loaded basically at the same time, but I want them to fade in
[17:37:41] <rgr> why basically?
[17:37:50] <zensei> but not all at once, like the second start 100 ms after the first and so on
[17:38:01] <zensei> because i think it would look nice
[17:38:56] <rgr> do an each on the selection collection and increment a dely variable in eahc one.
[17:39:03] <rgr> dely==delay
[17:39:20] <juha_> zensei: var images = [img,img,img]; for(i in img){setTimeout(function(){load_img(img[i]);}, 100);}
[17:39:25] <juha_> or something similar
[17:39:28] <eddiemonge> ?queue @ zensei
[17:39:29] <bot-t> zensei, .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[17:39:39] <eddiemonge> zensei: queue them up to animate
[17:39:46] <rgr> var d=0;$("sel").each(function(){blah;d+=100;}) etc
[17:40:26] <zensei> interesting, thank you. appreciated!
[17:41:02] <rgr> queue isnt what he wants based on the description.
[17:41:20] <coldhead> catcher: yeah, IDs should do what you want
[17:41:42] <coldhead> var link = $('#twitterlink').attr('href');
[17:47:46] <Axsuul> does it go.. li.class[attr="foo"] or li[attr="foo"].class
[17:48:29] <Axsuul> because both don't seem to work for me =/
[17:49:20] <nathanw_> hey can someone help me??
[17:50:48] <coldhead> Axsuul: are you trying to match <li attr="foo" class="class"> ?
[17:50:55] <coldhead> because that's what you're asking for
[17:51:26] <Axsuul> coldhead: yep
[17:51:26] <coldhead> the order shouldn't affect the results in any case
[17:51:26] <coldhead> only the speed
[17:52:28] <Axsuul> coldhead: i see, thanks
[17:52:37] <Axsuul> I expect to select by class first
[17:52:39] <Axsuul> would be faster?
[17:52:52] <coldhead> yes, it should be
[17:54:15] <catcher> coldhead, It's very close, but they all keep coming up with the same link value (instead of grabbing it anew for each item).. ideas?
[17:56:16] <java_s> hi, can someone tell me what's wrong here?
[17:56:17] <java_s> http://jsfiddle.net/DdNkZ/
[17:56:36] <java_s> iam not getting the lines splitted
[17:57:36] <coldhead>  The past participle of split is "split", not "splitted".
[17:58:26] <gnarf> you just got coldheaded
[17:58:34] <m00nkfish> welcome to #grammar
[17:58:39] <eddiemonge> zensei: a bit late but did you want something like http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/9MMRQ/
[17:58:56] <juha_> java_s: there's no content inside #txtValue
[17:59:37] <juha_> java_s: also, if i remember correctly, split() function takes only one attribute
[17:59:55] <catcher> In case I got lost in the split, how can I tell my jquery to re-retrieve the attribute I'm selecting? (it's dynamically populated, and always ending up with the first value atm)
[18:00:09] <coldhead> ?p @ catcher
[18:00:10] <bot-t> catcher, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:00:20] <coldhead> show us what yr talking about
[18:00:23] <catcher> kk
[18:01:41] <juha_> catcher: $(element).attr("attribute") or $(this).attr("attribute")
[18:01:47] <java_s> yeahm juha_ , i am mad, i have put content twice,
[18:01:50] <java_s> thanks
[18:01:59] <juha_> indeed you are mad
[18:02:03] <juha_> and this is sparta
[18:02:20] <java_s> all programmers are mad
[18:02:21] <catcher> juha_, that's what I'm doing, but it keeps getting the value of the first item instead of updating it for each in the list. Code coming right up..
[18:02:29] <gnarf> juha_: nope, its #jquery!!!!
[18:02:38] <nathanw_> how do I copy the contents of a <ul> into a <textarea> ?
[18:02:50] <juha_> catcher: wrong selector then
[18:03:24] <Axsuul> coldhead: is there a performance difference selecting classes vs selecting by attribute? If say, both have the same number of DOM elements
[18:03:47] <coldhead> class should be faster, Axsuul
[18:03:56] <coldhead> because the browser supports it natively
[18:04:08] <gnarf> .class > [attr] stuff
[18:04:10] <coldhead> but readability is more important
[18:04:12] <coldhead> ?optimisation
[18:04:12] <bot-t> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[18:04:16] <gnarf> even when the browser supports both
[18:04:22] <snover> coldhead when did you learn how to use the bot?!
[18:04:27] <Peppr_> lol
[18:04:34] <snover> bot-t: you should not talk to strangers.
[18:04:35] <bot-t> snover, Is that a question?
[18:04:53] <nathanw_> how do I copy the contents of a <ul> into a <textarea> ?
[18:05:18] <coldhead> i've been practicing in PM, snover
[18:05:21] <coldhead> also cyber
[18:05:25] <snover> print out a copy of the page, put it on a wooden table, then take a picture of it and paste it into the textarea
[18:05:30] <Peppr_> I second the recommendation from coldhead, on .class > [attr]. Was doing some work with those two lately and found .classes to a good margin faster.
[18:05:37] <juha_> nathanw_: $("textarea").val($("ul").html());
[18:05:45] <nathanw_> thanks :)
[18:05:57] <nathanw_> juha: will that grab all the <li> contents inside it ?
[18:06:18] <coldhead> it doesn't really matter how fast or slow your selectors are because no one will ever visit your site
[18:06:26] <juha_> nathanw_: one way to find it out
[18:06:32] <coldhead> everyone just uses facebook now
[18:06:39] <eddiemonge> ?prop @ catcher
[18:06:39] <bot-t> catcher, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[18:06:39] <juha_> coldhead: indeed
[18:06:41] <Axsuul> coldhead, gnarf: some benchmarks: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6533285/jquery-select-by-class-vs-select-by-attribute
[18:06:47] <nathanw_> finding out... stand by
[18:06:51] <coldhead> thanks Axsuul
[18:06:57] <Axsuul> looks like its 4x faster
[18:07:05] <Peppr_> nathanw_: that will grab the complete HTML of the ul.
[18:07:10] <gnarf> Axsuul: i just tested myself
[18:07:16] <nathanw_> yep grabs html
[18:07:21] <coldhead> Axsuul: you can also write less code :)
[18:07:27] <nathanw_> need it to grab the text contents of each <li>
[18:07:32] <Axsuul> true :D
[18:07:33] <catcher> ahh, interesting..
[18:07:38] <coldhead> who has time for [=""]
[18:07:40] <coldhead> not me
[18:07:40] <nathanw_> is it possible to format the text area with line breaks etc ?
[18:07:43] <catcher> http://jsbin.com/iroqeg/2/edit#javascript,html
[18:07:56] <Axsuul> gnarf: what were your results?
[18:08:01] <juha_> coldhead: using ' instead of " is a real timesaver!
[18:08:10] <coldhead> ooh protip, thx
[18:08:17] <catcher> So how can I hook the item to my jquery if the ID itself needs to change/update?
[18:08:39] <gnarf> Axsuul: class wins
[18:08:40] <gnarf> everywhere
[18:08:41] <coldhead> gnarf's results are usually "GNARF IS AWESOME"
[18:08:49] <Axsuul> gnarf: how bout compared to id?
[18:09:07] <gnarf> Axsuul: id is usually fastest, but tagname#id might actually be quicker
[18:09:21] <gnarf> jsperf.com it
[18:09:30] <gnarf> but realistically
[18:09:31] <juha_> gnarf: i thought that it's slower
[18:09:37] <gnarf> read any article on the performance of css selectors
[18:09:39] <Peppr_> nathanw_ : textarea should listen the  <br /> elements so if your li comes with br's it should format correctly. Unless you want to reformat the li content before you insert it.

[18:09:48] <juha_> gnarf: i thought that element#something is slower than just #someghing
[18:10:02] <nathanw_> Peppr: $("#selectedEquipment").val($("#selectEquips li").text()); seems to work, but no line breaks
[18:10:30] <nathanw_> Peppr: but there are no linebreaks in the <li>'s anyway, can I add them with JQ?
[18:10:46] <Axsuul> gnarf: thanks
[18:10:53] <Peppr_> nathanw_ : start up a pastybin instance where we can tweak there. No sense to spit code out in chat. Sound good?
[18:11:40] <nathanw_> sure, JS fiddle oK ?
[18:11:50] <Peppr_> works for me nathanw_
[18:12:49] <nathanw_> Peppr: will take me a few mins there's a fair bit ..
[18:13:12] <coldhead> this works catcher but i don't understand where your problem is
[18:13:53] <Peppr_> nathanw_ : not the whole page :) we can just have a small sample html to tackle the problem and give you a basic code set to work with . Sound fair?
[18:14:08] <nathanw_> ok
[18:14:17] <juha_> i don't understand anything about anything
[18:14:24] <catcher> coldhead, the "href" contents are populated by php, and keep changing - yet all tooltips keep referring to the first image's href.
[18:14:55] <coldhead> catcher: ah, you are reusing the same ID everywhere?
[18:14:56] <juha_> catcher: wrong selector
[18:15:10] <java_s> catcher, ur code?
[18:15:11] <catcher> Yes, same ID - not sure how to use an updating selector.
[18:15:18] <coldhead> you need to use a class instead if there are multiples
[18:15:28] <catcher> code: http://jsbin.com/iroqeg/2/edit#javascript,html
[18:15:41] <catcher> ahh, okay, I'll try making it a class.
[18:15:50] <juha_> catcher: id is unique to one element
[18:16:32] <coldhead> catcher: http://jsbin.com/iroqeg/3/edit
[18:16:43] <coldhead> that just gets the <a> in the current tooltip
[18:16:54] <coldhead> without worrying about class or anything
[18:16:57] <coldhead> it's egalitarian
[18:18:07] <nathanw_> argh i can't get it to work in js fiddle
[18:19:57] <java_s> try to pass the href value to the tool tip, onmouseover event

[18:21:44] <catcher> coldhead, that makes perfect sense. The URL is coming up 'undefined' for now, but this seems like a great approach.
[18:22:22] <eddiemonge> i am having lots of fun with markdown https://gist.github.com/1294035
[18:22:35] <Peppr_> nathanw_: I am working on a small sample, give me a few secs
[18:22:41] <eddiemonge> well it would be fun if github would stop converting my spaces to tabs
[18:22:53] <snover> no it wouldn’t
[18:22:54] <snover> it would be boring
[18:22:57] <snover> also github doesn’t do that
[18:23:30] <eddiemonge> its been doing it all day for me
[18:23:56] <nathanw_> ok thanks
[18:24:26] <eddiemonge> i think markdown is actually slower than doing pure html
[18:24:59] <gnarf> its a good thing markdown supports pure html
[18:25:11] <nathanw_> its actually doing what I want I just want each <li> that gets put in the text box to be on a separate line
[18:25:19] <nathanw_> using .text at the moment seems to work well
[18:26:08] <eddiemonge> snover: gnarf either of you use jekyll before?

[18:33:30] <nathanw_> mint!
[18:33:45] <nathanw_> how does .map work ?
[18:33:51] <Peppr_> I used a map function on the li, which will give you more control on how to tackle the formatting and potential selection of the li's . In case you need

[18:36:06] <m00nkfish> how can i get the active section in a jqueryui accordion?
[18:36:09] <nathanw_> gonna read a bit more on that cheers!
[18:36:09] <Peppr_> thanks juha_ for the t-bot link.

[18:38:25] <juha_> should i try to get some sleep for couple of hours or stay awake for an hour and go to work..
[18:39:43] <Peppr_> juha_: if you have 3 hours then sleep it ( since the average body needs 3 hours to complete 1 REM cycle ) if not than tough it out, you will be more alert for the most part.
[18:39:52] <Peppr_> But I am not doctor :P
[18:40:11] <juha_> i already slept 6 hours.. i was so tired after work yesterday..
[18:40:15] <Peppr_> *no doctor. Just been my experiences when it sleeping.
[18:40:30] <juha_> now i've been trying to get back to sleep for almost five hours.. :P
[18:40:34] <nathanw_> Peppr: how do I make it double line breaks ?
[18:41:12] <Peppr_> juha_: then cat nap for 45 mins if you already had 6 hours, you will feel more refreshed.
[18:42:30] <Peppr_> nathanw_: updated the code for you. Just add "\n\n" to the join function. http://jsfiddle.net/9mxzd/14/
[18:43:27] <snover> juha_: staring into a box of light does not help you get to sleep
[18:43:37] <juha_> snover: indeed
[18:43:44] <Peppr_> lol, nice touch snover :P
[18:43:49] <nathanw_> genius
[18:44:12] <juha_> snover: but after rolling around for more than enough, i decided to open this brainmelting device
[18:47:58] <Peppr_> quick question to whomever worked with the .load function in jQuery. I need to have a series of links pulled and appended to an html list with ajax. The task is pretty straightforward, but there is SOP issue with this approach since my script will be located on a separate server at all times. I was thinking of making the file json to try to remove the SOP issues, but not sure if that will work. Anyone ever tried something like be
[18:48:31] <Peppr_> *like this before
[18:53:52] <Peppr_> anyone, up for tackling my dilemma? 8-)
[18:55:29] <juha_> so, basically cross-domain calls? you need jsonp for it
[18:57:02] <Peppr_1> I was just simply going to have a .json file of properties that my script would then convert to links.
[18:58:11] <Peppr_1> juha_ : brb making some food.
[19:00:44] <m00nkfish> are there any known issues with creating form elements (<select>, <input>) using jquery in internet explorer?
[19:01:30] <juha_> m00nkfish: live submit
[19:03:27] <LuckyBambu> What would be a "longer" replacement for .load() and specifying an element? I'm trying to reduce my AJAX on a page to one request per 5 seconds instead of 7, so I'd like to load a bunch of elements into a page and then insert them in my current one
[19:04:35] <m00nkfish> juha_: what's that?
[19:05:11] <m00nkfish> oh ive googled. im not using it
[19:05:17] <juha_> m00nkfish: $("form").live("submit",function()); doesn't seem to be working on ie7 and lower, if i remember correctly
[19:05:23] <m00nkfish> my form elements dont use submit at all
[19:05:50] <juha_> LuckyBambu: json is pretty cool for that sort of work
[19:06:31] <LuckyBambu> juha_ I was playing with that, but i'm using CakePHP and it's great... except when you need to do anything manually with the data, if you know what I mean
[19:06:41] <LuckyBambu> It's super messy to deal with the results from any kind of query
[19:06:47] <m00nkfish> im just creating form elements like $("<select/>") then appending them to my html
[19:07:16] <m00nkfish> works in chrome, ff, safari.... in ie, they dont appear :(
[19:07:19] <juha_> LuckyBambu: echo json_encode($array);  ;)
[19:07:31] <LuckyBambu> juha_ If you could see my JSON you would be sad.
[19:07:32] <LuckyBambu> lol
[19:07:39] <juha_> m00nkfish: any errors?
[19:07:40] <LuckyBambu> I just spent the last few hours trying to get something nice to come out
[19:07:47] <coldhead> ?time finland
[19:07:48] <bot-t> coldhead, finland - Time: 5:07am Tuesday (EEST), Weather: Mostly Cloudy, 7C / 45F
[19:07:57] <coldhead> yeesh, juha_
[19:08:01] <juha_> i know
[19:08:06] <coldhead> i know you know
[19:08:12] <coldhead> please know that i know you know
[19:08:14] <juha_> first bus to work comes in 20 minutes
[19:08:15] <m00nkfish> juha: something that is seemingly unrelated from a different script
[19:08:21] <juha_> going to get some sleep t work
[19:08:41] <jaypitidi> how can I get my onFocus="clearThis()" to NOT clear the value once it has been set by the user?
[19:08:43] <juha_> m00nkfish: fix that first
[19:09:05] <juha_> jaypitidi: do you have some default values?
[19:09:45] <jaypitidi> Yes I have a default value set in jquery like: $('#city').val('default value here');
[19:09:47] <juha_> jaypitidi: var value = $("input").val(); if($("input").val() != value) { $("input").clear(); } or something
[19:10:32] <juha_> coldhead: i now know that you know that i know
[19:12:55] <m00nkfish> juha_: is it possible that an error in a different script is preventing form elements being created? all of the other code in my script works fine
[19:13:13] <juha_> m00nkfish: could be
[19:22:37] <stormlifter> How come when i do this: http://dpaste.com/636269/  'obj' isn't in the post?
[19:24:05] <juha_> stormlifter: what does console.log(aoData) give you?
[19:24:45] <stormlifter> The associative array, but for some reason obj isn't in there.
[19:25:15] <stormlifter> http://dpaste.com/636272/ < that's the output
[19:25:25] <stormlifter> I'm thinking I have the wrong syntax for this. Just don't know where.
[19:26:35] <hba> hi all, any documentation about how to filter and prevent the request when using autocomplete? Im using a remote source (json) but i would like to prevent the ajax() request if the text entered by the user match some criterial. does this make sense? :)
[19:26:50] <stormlifter> juha_ figured it out. aoData.push({'name':'obj','value':'{{obj}}'})
[19:27:24] <stormlifter> juha_: that trick of the console thing is awesome :)
[19:28:17] <juha_> stormlifter: oh yeah, javascript isn't like php with arrays
[19:50:46] <Kyuss_> hey
[19:51:04] <Kyuss_> can someone help ?
[19:51:34] <Kyuss_> what does "error: jquerry 1.5 + required" ??
[19:52:03] <Kyuss_> anyone ?
[19:52:46] <Kyuss_> ???
[19:53:28] <Kyuss_> plz
[19:57:56] <falieson> so i'm trying to create a linkdiv class so that I can click on a div and it will be a link, can someone tell me why its not working? http://jsfiddle.net/FBa5D/1/
[20:11:59] <abjorn> *sigh* coldhead, have you ever met a javascript hater that had any arguments that weren't completely basis, vague, or just patently untrue?
[20:12:03] <abjorn> *baseless
[20:13:09] <abjorn> This is so annoying, I'm trying to genuinely have a discussion with this person and change his mind, but all he does is give silly reasons to dislike the language, like that you have to "jump through hoops" to use prototypal inheritance rather than with class-based inheritance. I ask him "How do you have to jump through hoops?" and he gives me no real description.
[20:13:11] <abjorn> It's sad, really.
[20:17:06] <Es0teric> ok, i have this problem -> http://pastie.org/private/slf9rzp98fcgexai7wa & what it is is that it will toggle the overlay on, but it wont toggle it off...
[20:18:13] <jiggawhat> hey guys, I need a simple jquery that can count <li> in a gallery
[20:18:19] <jiggawhat> example
[20:18:25] <jiggawhat> 1 of 4
[20:18:41] <jiggawhat> there's 4 <li> there
[20:18:55] <jiggawhat> I just need the numbers to be automatically updated
[20:19:05] <jiggawhat> here
[20:19:35] <jiggawhat> <p><span>1</span> of <span>4</span></p>
[20:20:20] <jiggawhat> so I want whatever is in those spans to be updated when they press next to go to next LI
[20:20:38] <jiggawhat> trying to figure the easiest way for that
[20:24:11] <Louis11> I have a script that animates images (basically fades to several different images). It works, however whenever the script runs again, the website jumps back to the top of the page. How do I prevent that from happening? http://pastebin.com/iuN61DWX
[20:31:15] <coldhead> abjorn: all a JS hater needs to say is "i don't feel like typing 'function () { }' a thousand times a day"
[20:31:24] <abjorn> lol
[20:31:25] <coldhead> and it's true, that's a chore
[20:31:29] <abjorn> that's true
[20:31:32] <abjorn> I like that Go
[20:31:33] <abjorn> shortens it
[20:31:34] <abjorn> to func
[20:31:39] <Es0teric> em -> http://pastie.org/private/slf9rzp98fcgexai7wa & what it is is that it will toggle the overlay on, but it wont toggle it off...
[20:31:44] <coldhead> and CS shorts it to ->
[20:31:50] <coldhead> they know
[20:31:54] <Es0teric> ** ok, i have this problem -> http://pastie.org/private/slf9rzp98fcgexai7wa & what it is is that it will toggle the overlay on, but it wont toggle it off..
[20:32:23] <abjorn> I don't like ->
[20:33:12] <coldhead> you prefer function () {} ?
[20:33:55] <abjorn> nope
[20:34:02] <abjorn> I think I'll never decide what I like
[20:34:19] <abjorn> cause (args) -> {
[20:34:19] <abjorn>   // body
[20:34:19] <abjorn> }
[20:34:19] <abjorn> just looks awkward to me
[20:34:27] <abjorn> idk why
[20:34:40] <abjorn> it's trivial anyways, it's not worth complaining about
[20:34:52] <abjorn> lol seriously
[20:35:00] <abjorn> this guy complaining that there isn't a "proper" dicitonary type
[20:35:04] <abjorn> in javascript
[20:35:21] <abjorn> objects are fucking dictionaries, there honestly isn't a single feature of a standalone dictionary that you can't do with an object
[20:35:43] <coldhead> the thing is that JS has been hated and vilified for a lot longer than it's been appreciated
[20:35:50] <coldhead> it's like the opposite of nazism
[20:35:56] <coldhead> it's hard to change people's minds
[20:36:07] <coldhead> as soon as they see the swastika they're like "ooh hitler is so bad"
[20:36:12] <abjorn> yeah, because programmers are so inherently closed minded
[20:36:14] <coldhead> and they forget about the love
[20:36:15] <Es0teric> coldhead, are you familiar with lights off/on scripts?
[20:36:23] <abjorn> also lol @ nazi love
[20:36:36] <coldhead> no Es0teric, that is not something i have ever heard of
[20:37:00] <Es0teric> well, coldhead its essentially something like this -> http://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/examples/TurnOffTheLights/#
[20:37:22] <Es0teric> you click, and a black overlay shows.. you click again and the overlay dissapears
[20:37:53] <abjorn> You would think programmers would be inherently intelligent thus open-minded, but it never really works out that way it seems
[20:38:10] <abjorn> "NO THIS WAY IS THE BEST AND NOTHING COULD EVER BE BETTER, AND THIS OTHER THING SUCKS BECAUSE ITS NOT LIKE THIS THING"
[20:38:56] <coldhead> i don't know if that's a fair characterisation of most programmers
[20:38:57] <Es0teric> i cant even figure out why this works for one but doesnt work for the other -_-
[20:39:23] <coldhead> what is not working Es0teric ?
[20:39:58] <Es0teric> coldhead -> http://pastie.org/private/slf9rzp98fcgexai7wa that is not working.. its essentially a lights on/off script just tweaked a little bit
[20:40:03] <abjorn> coldhead: well apparently it is for amateur game devs, because I hang out in #vidyadev and that's 95% of them
[20:40:22] <Es0teric> coldhead, what happens is that when i click to turn off the lights, it works... but when i click to turn them back on, it doesnt remove the overlay
[20:40:47] <coldhead> the secret to convincing games devs of anything is to be john carmack
[20:41:04] <coldhead> not working how, Es0teric ?
[20:41:07] <abjorn> not anymore
[20:41:10] <coldhead> a live demo on jsfiddle is usually better
[20:41:18] <coldhead> because otherwise i have to run it in my imagination
[20:41:20] <abjorn> he's lost acceptance among game devs recently
[20:41:20] <abjorn> :(
[20:41:24] <coldhead> where everything works fine
[20:41:27] <coldhead> abjorn: OH NO!!
[20:41:30] <abjorn> partially because of Rage
[20:41:41] <Es0teric> coldhead, what happens is that when i click to turn off the lights, it works... but when i click to turn them back on, it doesnt remove the overlay
[20:41:41] <abjorn> because it game out buggy and without proper video options
[20:41:43] <abjorn> so theyre like
[20:41:51] <abjorn> "SHITTY CONSOLE PORT, CARMACK SELLING OUT, WAH WAH"
[20:41:56] <coldhead> cool, good description Es0teric
[20:42:13] <Es0teric> so coldhead, this is what happens - click, overlay shows... click overlay stays (doesnt dissapear like it should)
[20:42:22] <abjorn> to be fair idk how a game with such bad graphical bugs could get past the 50 or so QA's that was in the ending credits lol
[20:42:38] <Es0teric> idk how to jsfiddle that code...
[20:43:10] <abjorn> ya gotta
[20:43:11] <abjorn> fiddle
[20:43:15] <insertjokehere> is there a jQuery selector equivelant to the regex '?'
[20:43:18] <insertjokehere> eg, http://jsfiddle.net/cAnvP/
[20:43:31] <insertjokehere> trying to select ae,be,ce but leave de unselected
[20:43:52] <coldhead> Es0teric: http://pastie.org/private/s7cvf9hfryrulctbfj8xmq
[20:44:11] <coldhead> i have changed the order to be more readable (in my opinion)
[20:44:18] <coldhead> i also prefer is() to hasClass()
[20:44:26] <coldhead> and i added a console.log so you can see wtf is happening
[20:44:30] <coldhead> GOOD LUCK
[20:44:57] <coldhead> Es0teric: my guess is the 2nd click isn't being received
[20:45:00] <abjorn> not(.d) should be fine
[20:45:03] <abjorn> @insertjokehere
[20:45:03] <coldhead> because the overlay is catching it
[20:45:09] <insertjokehere> 'find anything with class e that is the child of #a, but exclude anything that is the child of .d'
[20:45:24] <Es0teric> coldhead, i was thinking that too.. but idk how to make that work
[20:45:28] <abjorn> alternatively
[20:45:33] <coldhead> Es0teric: bind to the overlay itself
[20:45:42] <abjorn> .find(".a e, .b e, .c e")
[20:45:48] <abjorn> should work
[20:45:54] <Es0teric> coldhead, bind to the overlay?
[20:46:18] <insertjokehere> abjorn: yeah, was trying to find a way that wouldnt require me to be updating selectors every time the page structure changed slightly
[20:46:27] <coldhead> Es0teric: http://pastie.org/private/25kzciezompmhfa6mf9ca
[20:46:40] <abjorn> is ":not(.d) .e)" not working?
[20:46:42] <coldhead> probably need to change a few other things
[20:46:48] <coldhead> but you see what i mean
[20:47:22] <insertjokehere> abjorn: :not(.d) .e misses things that are children of the top class
[20:47:30] <insertjokehere> see the fiddle i linked to
[20:47:30] <Es0teric> coldhead, uh no.. i dont see what you mean with that..
[20:47:42] <coldhead> ?add @ Es0teric
[20:47:42] <bot-t> Es0teric, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[20:48:00] <coldhead> i added the id of #the__lights
[20:48:06] <coldhead> so you could listen for a click on them too
[20:48:07] <abjorn> Oh, yeah, because ae is a direct child of a, and you're searching for a child of a child, insertjokehere
[20:48:33] <insertjokehere> yeah, gathered that, is there a way to have part of the selector be optional?
[20:48:51] <insertjokehere> eg, in regex you could do something like (:not(.d))? .e
[20:49:09] <insertjokehere> :not(.d) matched 0 or 1 times, followed be .e
[20:49:31] <insertjokehere> or do i have to do 2 selectors, check for children seperate?
[20:49:35] <m00nkfish> is jquery backwards compatible
[20:49:54] <coldhead> Es0teric: http://pastie.org/private/cvhnkvdrpcyjpurxjx8zdg
[20:50:05] <m00nkfish> i think my issues are stemming from the main site using 1.3.2 which i want to upgrade to 1.6.x
[20:50:13] <Es0teric> coldhead, when i clicked on the #tool-dim the first time, it returned false.. but then when i clicked on it again, it returned true, and it returned true again after i clicked it for a 3rd time
[20:51:01] <Es0teric> i am using firebug.. so its telling me all of this
[20:51:29] <coldhead> Es0teric: http://pastie.org/private/n6w9tywspkcir4evgtsa
[20:51:40] <coldhead> that ensures you add/remove from the right element
[20:52:05] <abjorn> insertjokehere: http://jsfiddle.net/cAnvP/1/
[20:52:08] <abjorn> it's kind of
[20:52:09] <abjorn> long
[20:52:11] <abjorn> and roundabout
[20:52:13] <abjorn> lol
[20:52:32] <abjorn> honestly you'd be better off just doing .find(".e, :not(.d) .e")
[20:52:48] <insertjokehere> awesome, thanks
[20:53:20] <coldhead> listen to this dude rufus, he knows what he's talking about
[20:53:22] <abjorn> the filter function method is more flexible though - would work in more cases
[20:53:38] <abjorn> but .find(".e, :not(.d) .e") is shorter, easier to understand, and probably faster
[20:53:44] <abjorn> *shrug* whichever floats your boat
[20:54:08] <coldhead> lol speed
[20:54:16] <abjorn> yeah it probably wouldn't matter
[20:54:18] <abjorn> lol
[20:54:27] <abjorn> micro-optimization, yaaayy!
[20:54:28] <insertjokehere> find(.e, :not(.d) .e) selects all elements
[20:54:47] <abjorn> fucking
[20:54:50] <abjorn> selectors
[20:54:55] <insertjokehere> lol yup
[20:55:05] <abjorn> $("#a .e, #a :not(.d) .e")
[20:55:09] <abjorn> lol
[20:55:09] <coldhead> how do they work
[20:55:15] <abjorn> sorry, #a > .e
[20:55:36] <Es0teric> coldhead, i am currently reviewing the code still.. firefox crashed on me..
[20:55:44] <abjorn> I don't think you can do .find("> .e, :not(.d) .e")
[20:56:12] <abjorn> lol nope doesn't work
[20:56:18] <insertjokehere> $(panel).find("#panel-queueSettings :not(.extraSettingsContainer) .settingItem, #panel-queueSettings > .settingItem")
[20:56:25] <insertjokehere> 2 distinct selectors it is
[20:57:01] <abjorn> lol
[20:57:44] <abjorn> if only & would work in .find to refer to the parent element
[20:58:25] <abjorn> then you'd be able to do find("& > .e, :not(.d) .e")
[20:59:48] <Es0teric> coldhead, the last pastie you gave me makes the page refresh everytime #tool-dim is clicked...
[21:00:28] <coldhead> abjorn: http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved
[21:00:50] <coldhead> yeah i'm not actually doing this for you, Es0teric, i'm just making suggestions
[21:00:57] <coldhead> my new suggestion is fix that problem
[21:01:06] <abjorn> I'm too lazy coldhead
[21:01:07] <abjorn> far too lazy
[21:01:10] <Es0teric> coldhead, that is what i am doing right now
[21:01:15] <abjorn> also the sizzle source is like "whut" to me
[21:01:15] <coldhead> good work!
[21:01:36] <coldhead> abjorn: k let's just wait for parent selectors in CSS
[21:01:44] <coldhead> i'll be dead by then
[21:01:49] <abjorn> or
[21:01:52] <coldhead> but you young people, what a bright future
[21:01:54] <abjorn> now stick with me here
[21:01:55] <abjorn> we could
[21:01:57] <abjorn> work around it!
[21:02:08] <abjorn> lord knows us web devs are used to that >.>
[21:02:10] <coldhead> i resent your use of the word "work"
[21:02:11] <coldhead> it makes me tired
[21:02:15] <abjorn> rofl
[21:02:20] <coldhead> AND ANGRY
[21:02:51] <abjorn> if I had the genius enough to comprehend the sizzle source i totes would try and implement that, though
[21:02:51] <insertjokehere> coldhead: what? and make CSS a sane system? hell, ill probably be dead before that happens, and im not out of uni yet
[21:03:02] <abjorn> nothing can make CSS a sane system
[21:03:10] <abjorn> you'd have to start from scratch
[21:03:37] <brma> hi guys, I need to do a simple script that connect to a server via tcp and receive some numbers every second then update this number on the site somehow, just a simple thing but I dont know anything about javascript/jquery/ajax/whatever if someone can give me a hint on how to do it or where to start learn from and what to learn it would be appreciated
[21:03:43] <insertjokehere> LESS is a step in the right direction
[21:04:04] <insertjokehere> brma: doing it over plain old TCP is not a good idea
[21:04:11] <coldhead> you whippersnappers don't know how good you have it
[21:04:16] <coldhead> i remember before we had CSS
[21:04:32] <rgr> css is pretty consistent now.
[21:04:37] <insertjokehere> if you can get it to spit out some JSON or XML over HTTP, then you are in buisness
[21:04:39] <coldhead> if you wanted a background image YOU USED A TABLE
[21:04:51] <coldhead> AND PAINT SHOP PRO
[21:05:32] <brma> insertjokehere you mean the server provide the data in xml?
[21:05:38] <insertjokehere> yeah
[21:06:17] <rgr> brma: google up jquery.getJSON and php. Oodles of tutorials.
[21:06:37] <insertjokehere> ig you absolutly have to use plain old TCP, then you are probably going to need to use silverlight or flash (*shudder*)
[21:06:40] <rgr> you dont need to know anything about tcp or xml
[21:07:17] <rgr> but sounds to me like you need to understnd the overall picture long before tech specific solutions.
[21:07:20] <brma> but this data is dynamic I mean the server will receive it then forward to the browser
[21:07:37] <rgr> receive it from where?
[21:07:48] <rgr> you mean frm the script in the browser?
[21:07:48] <brma> from another computer
[21:08:15] <abjorn> lol paint shop pro
[21:08:20] <abjorn> i remember that
[21:08:21] <rgr> someone has missed a few lectures it seems -,)
[21:09:03] <m00nkfish> how do i use .noconflict ?
[21:09:19] <brma> its a streaming server, one computer streaming to the server via rtp then I need to get this data and make it available to a browser
[21:09:36] <m00nkfish> specifically in the case where the site i am programming for is running jquery 1.3.2 but i am using 1.6 - i need to be able to run both at the same time
[21:09:37] <brma> thats the scenario
[21:10:08] <abjorn> coldhead: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/sizzle.js#L200 boy I sure wish this source code had like...any comments. I might actually be able to do it if I had ANY context for any of this lol
[21:11:43] <coldhead> yeah i see what you mean
[21:12:32] <abjorn> if the context argument is just the parent element I can maybe do it
[21:13:28] <evil-twin> is there any reason why i get undefined when trying to get data-responsible="John" using .data('responsible') on an input[checkbox] on a .live('change', ... ?
[21:13:34] <coldhead> i love when snover busts out the latin when filing issues for sizzle
[21:13:53] <abjorn> lol
[21:14:18] <coldhead> evil-twin: what does .attr('data-responsible') give you?
[21:14:21] <binaryfus10nz> nice link for multiple slideshows 1 pager jquery cycle http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3003226/jquery-cycle-plugin-one-pager-to-control-multiple-slideshow-on-a-page
[21:15:10] <coldhead> evil-twin: this explains more than you need to know, hopefully: http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[21:15:18] <coldhead> there are some gotchas with dynamically added stuff
[21:16:20] <rgr> brma: you need to read up on the entire overview of web tech. In particular php, ajax, json, jscript/jquery it seems. Oodles of how tos but youre not going to get a canned solution from something so high level and airy fairy. But in a nutshell : php server, sessions, json ($.getJSON), html possibly.
[21:17:02] <coldhead> that was a good canned solution actually :P
[21:18:51] <abjorn> chunker = /((?:\((?:\([^()]+\)|[^()]+)+\)|\[(?:\[[^\[\]]*\]|['"][^'"]*['"]|[^\[\]'"]+)+\]|\\.|[^ >+~,(\[\\]+)+|[>+~])(\s*,\s*)?((?:.|\r|\n)*)/g
[21:18:51] <abjorn> seriously wtf
[21:18:57] <tolland> jquery is far too powerful.
[21:19:01] <abjorn> how can someone comprehend that much regex
[21:19:05] <rgr> where can I see what data() values are reserved? e.g elem.data("events")
[21:19:11] <abjorn> I doubt I could ever in my existence be that adept at regex
[21:19:28] <rgr> it was probably autogenerated
[21:19:51] <rgr> using something like regexp-builder in emacs
[21:20:10] <abjorn> I guess that's possible
[21:20:24] <abjorn> Although I would imagine in the interest of debugging they might avoid that
[21:20:45] <rgr> why? I ti works it works. Its why tools exist to generate them.
[21:21:02] <rgr> stick it in a function and you never need to see it.
[21:21:07] <abjorn> *shrug*
[21:21:13] <wookiehangover> because it needlessly obfuscates your code
[21:21:18] <abjorn> I would be hard pressed to trust a regex generator
[21:21:20] <rgr> depends on needlessley
[21:21:57] <rgr> I would absolutely trust oe if thats what its job is. Its been tested by oodles of others. What next not trust a compiler?
[21:22:35] <abjorn> BECAUSE I SAID SO
[21:22:46] <abjorn> clearly it works though so
[21:22:47] <abjorn> wutev
[21:38:49] <m0nkfish> what the fuck is wrong with jquery :(
[21:38:58] <m0nkfish> x.after(y) works but y.before(x) doesnt
[21:40:28] <m0nkfish> http://pastebin.com/rX8SjKq1
[21:40:32] * m0nkfish kicks javascript
[21:40:55] <abjorn> hey now
[21:41:00] <abjorn> don't blame javascript
[21:41:32] <acidjazz> so i got this popup .. a div that shows as a pulldown menu .. and i want to figure out an easy way to remove it if someone clicks outside of its boundary .. any easy way to do that?
[21:41:42] <m0nkfish> well if it would throw some kind of error message i would actually be able to understand whats going wrong
[21:41:54] <coldhead> m0nkfish: can you get a demo of this behaviour up on jsfiddle?
[21:42:45] <m0nkfish> im not sure, ive never used jsfiddle
[21:42:46] <m0nkfish> ill try
[21:43:00] <abjorn> it should be easy enough
[21:46:35] <m0nkfish> on jsfiddle it works :/
[21:49:09] <m0nkfish> aha ok here we are
[21:49:30] <m0nkfish> http://jsfiddle.net/Jqwcs/
[21:50:10] <m0nkfish> if you comment out the first return statement of the checkboxfilter() function
[21:50:14] <m0nkfish> the div appears
[21:51:52] <Abbas-> guys, i'm trying to hide a .warnings div inside an iframe on my page. . if i do if($'.warnings'){ }, it reports the element exists. but inside that block, i'm doing element.hide() but the warnigns element isn't hidden on the page upon load.
[21:51:56] <Abbas-> what am i doing wrong?
[21:52:26] <m0nkfish> Abbas-: paste code
[21:52:31] <Eviltwin> First of all
[21:52:38] <Eviltwin> if($('.warnings'){ ... }
[21:52:48] <Eviltwin> Rather if($('.warnings')){ ... }
[21:52:58] <Eviltwin> Second that doesn't tell you if it exists or not
[21:53:11] <Eviltwin> if($('.warnings').length){ ... } will
[21:54:24] <m0nkfish> coldhead: any ideas re http://jsfiddle.net/Jqwcs/
[21:54:24] <m0nkfish> ?
[21:55:38] <coldhead> i don't understand, m0nkfish
[21:55:46] <coldhead> i see a handsome looking checkbox!
[21:55:49] <coldhead> it seems to work okay
[21:56:22] <coldhead> oh you know what might be a problem m0nkfish
[21:56:28] <coldhead> you can't return twice from a function
[21:56:32] <coldhead> you only get one shot at that
[21:56:51] <m0nkfish> try removing the first return statement from checkboxFilter()
[21:56:52] <coldhead> the 2nd return never gets a chance
[21:56:58] <coldhead> ah k
[21:57:19] <m0nkfish> the two return statements are just for ease of demonstration - perhaps i should have defined two functions instead
[21:58:05] <coldhead> no we're good, now that i understand
[21:58:17] <m0nkfish> http://jsfiddle.net/Jqwcs/4/
[21:58:35] <m0nkfish> sorry the code is messy in this instance, i just copypasted
[21:58:48] <m0nkfish> as you can see, the "test" text is only present in 3 of the 4 function calls
[21:59:03] <m0nkfish> try running it in internet explorer and its even more of a mess
[21:59:23] <m0nkfish> the text is still present 3 times but there is only one checkbox and one selectbox
[21:59:49] <m0nkfish> i find it a little strange that something this basic would have slipped through the jquery net..?
[21:59:56] <m0nkfish> ill see if i can simplify the demo
[22:02:45] <m0nkfish> here
[22:02:45] <m0nkfish> http://jsfiddle.net/Jqwcs/11/
[22:02:51] <m0nkfish> as simple as they get
[22:04:39] <coldhead> you're right to be skeptical, m0nkfish, jQuery has a lot of unit tests before anything gets committed
[22:04:57] <coldhead> i'm not sure what the problem is but you have a nice demo of the problem
[22:05:13] <coldhead> let's see if we can get gnarf to explain why we're stupid
[22:07:36] <coldhead> you know what i think it is, m0nkfish
[22:07:43] <coldhead> you're returning control
[22:07:52] <coldhead> and the stuff that is appended after isn't part of control
[22:07:57] <coldhead> it's "after" it
[22:08:09] <coldhead> so it just gets lost
[22:08:16] <coldhead> if you do the append inside the functions it works
[22:08:39] <coldhead> if you want to return successive elements like that you might need to wrap them insomething
[22:08:48] <coldhead> and unwrap them when you receive them
[22:10:14] <m0nkfish> you are probably right, but i still think the behaviour is bizarrely inconsistent
[22:10:18] <coldhead> m0nkfish: http://jsfiddle.net/ALSFw/
[22:10:22] <coldhead> that seems to confirm it
[22:10:35] <coldhead> you think after() should add whatever is in after() to the existing set?
[22:11:16] <m0nkfish> i think that .before() and .after() should probably do similar things
[22:11:22] <m0nkfish> http://jsfiddle.net/Jqwcs/19/
[22:11:49] <m0nkfish> here it seems to depend on the return type of the object
[22:12:06] <coldhead> they behave similarly for me here: http://jsfiddle.net/ALSFw/1/
[22:12:18] <Abbas-> oh yeah Eviltwin , .length tells me the element is not there on pge load time
[22:12:22] <coldhead> it's unusual to return jQuery objects as you're doing
[22:12:43] <Abbas-> its a facebook iframe warning inside my page that i'm trying to hide. i had this suspicison, caz the facebook box loads several seconds after the rest of the page is loaded
[22:12:44] <m0nkfish> look specifically at the 2nd and 4th function calls
[22:12:58] <Abbas-> what is the best way to run .hide() after that fb elements are loaded?
[22:13:10] <m0nkfish> the only thing different is the return statement, control.after(text) vs text.after(control)
[22:13:15] <Abbas-> i tried .delay, didn't help me with $('warnings').delay(4000).hide()
[22:13:16] <m0nkfish> yet in the first instance only the control is returned
[22:13:24] <m0nkfish> in the second instance both text AND control are returned
[22:14:01] <m0nkfish> seems that the type of DOM object is having an effect on the method's return value
[22:15:11] <m0nkfish> i wonder how .insertBefore and .insertAfter fare in these cases
[22:15:14] <m0nkfish> probably worth a look
[22:15:49] <soundhorn> :)
[22:16:27] <coldhead> m0nkfish: show gnarf your demo when he's around, he'll know
[22:16:32] <coldhead> he also smells good
[22:18:12] * gnarf raises an eyebrow
[22:18:38] <Eviltwin> Abbas-: .delay() only works for the animation queue
[22:18:47] <Abbas-> oh
[22:19:14] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[22:19:19] <Eviltwin> Scroll down to the bold text
[22:19:23] <gnarf> m0nkfish: have you tried on the edge version?
[22:20:09] <gnarf> and/or can you describe your problem please? :)
[22:20:25] <gnarf> your test case doesn't seem very straightforward
[22:22:00] <coldhead> gnarf: return a.after(b) seems to just return a, whereas return a.before(b) returns a + b
[22:22:02] <m0nkfish> the .before() and .after() methods of DOM objects seem to vary in their return value
[22:22:06] <coldhead> where a and b are jQuery objects
[22:22:12] <gnarf> right right
[22:22:16] <Spadeski> sp
[22:22:17] <gnarf> does it actually return both?
[22:22:19] <Spadeski> sup
[22:22:28] <m0nkfish> gnarf: sometimes?
[22:22:48] <m0nkfish> dependent on the type of DOM object of a and b, apparently
[22:22:55] <m0nkfish> i havent investigated a whole lot
[22:22:56] <Spadeski> http://209.172.30.190/WWWRoot Any suggestions ?
[22:23:05] <m0nkfish> but the jsfiddle demonstration should speak for itself
[22:23:22] <gnarf> m0nkfish: not entirely
[22:23:24] <gnarf> so like
[22:23:49] <gnarf> $("<input>").after("<div>") === [<input>,<div>]
[22:24:39] <m0nkfish> depends on your browser
[22:24:44] <m0nkfish> on chrome:
[22:24:50] <m0nkfish> $("<input>").after("<div>") === <input>
[22:25:06] <m0nkfish> $("<div>").after("<input>") === [<div>,<input>]
[22:25:29] <m0nkfish> on ie:
[22:25:34] <m0nkfish> $("<div>").after("<input>") === <div>
[22:25:55] <patrick99e99> has anyone here used jqplot?
[22:27:33] <gnarf> m0nkfish: try with some other element types
[22:27:37] <gnarf> but check this out too:
[22:28:12] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/C96wD/
[22:28:25] <m0nkfish> god damn x_x
[22:28:29] <gnarf> much more reduced
[22:28:38] <gnarf> also, don't use those self closing xml tags
[22:28:43] <gnarf> unless you're in an xhtml doctype
[22:28:59] <m0nkfish> will jquery automaticall close them?
[22:29:16] <gnarf> m0nkfish: yes
[22:29:22] <m0nkfish> that is nice of it
[22:29:27] <gnarf> you can't make unclosed tags
[22:29:46] <gnarf> anyway, something is obviously different if its a checkbox vs input vs span
[22:30:03] <m0nkfish> but yes i guess my point was "the return value of .before and .after is undefined"
[22:30:18] <gnarf> ?after
[22:30:19] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[22:30:25] <m0nkfish> i dont like undefined return values in my functions! it makes for 6 hours of debugging
[22:31:08] <gnarf> thats just kinda bad tho
[22:31:23] <gnarf> you're putting a "disconnected node"
[22:31:32] <m0nkfish> ok
[22:31:32] <gnarf> trying to "after" it is kinda iffy
[22:31:42] <gnarf> granted the docs seem to say it should owrk
[22:31:47] <gnarf> but it obviously has a bug
[22:31:48] <m0nkfish> well i have fixed it in my code anyway but i really think they should just not return anything !
[22:31:48] <gnarf> :)
[22:31:59] <m0nkfish> or they should work consistently :)
[22:32:02] <gnarf> m0nkfish: you should use .add() if you just want to add something to a set
[22:32:15] <gnarf> .before() and .after() are giving you headaches in this case
[22:32:19] <m0nkfish> cool
[22:33:07] <eddiemonge> <input without an explicit type should be text but its not since its getting added
[22:33:38] <eddiemonge> before and after are returning the correct thing if you use a valid type on input
[22:33:46] <coldhead> m0nkfish: if you could be bothered filing a ticket for this it sure would be nice of you!
[22:34:05] <eddiemonge> ?eval $("<div>").after("<input type='text'>")
[22:34:05] <coldhead> then everytime someone uses it later and it worked it would be because of you
[22:34:06] <bot-t> eddiemonge: TypeError: div is undefined
[22:34:10] <coldhead> leading to longer lasting sex
[22:34:19] <coldhead> sorry wrong window
[22:34:35] <gnarf> bot-t: can't work with the DOM
[22:34:36] <bot-t> gnarf, Concentrate and ask again.
[22:34:51] <coldhead> bot-t: it still won't work, you're not built that way
[22:34:52] <bot-t> coldhead, .delay() - Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[22:35:06] <m0nkfish> coldhead unfortunately it is 6:30am and i am just about ready to slam my head into my pillow
[22:35:17] <m0nkfish> i will try and muster up the will to do it tomorrow
[22:35:21] <coldhead> m0nkfish: godspeed you to sleep then, thank you for your patience!
[22:35:51] <eddiemonge> what? coldhead thanking someone? inbelievabible
[22:36:13] <coldhead> sorry, i've had to much coffee
[22:36:20] <coldhead> now i'm even apologising
[22:36:27] <coldhead> send more paramedics
[22:37:00] <eddiemonge> seriously
[22:38:34] <gnarf> m0nkfish: please try to get a nice reduced case and file a bug
[22:38:43] <coldhead> he will, he's a good lad
[22:39:11] <coldhead> thanks for taking a look gnarf
[22:39:14] <nathanw_> anyone know what causes ' error[object XMLHttpRequest] ' when submitting a webform via ajax ?
[22:39:48] <coldhead> nathanw_: something bad happened?
[22:39:55] <coldhead> can you paste your code somewher?
[22:42:50] <cypha> coldhead, how can I have an <img> tag on my site that points at a file by the name DSC00061(6).JPG
[22:43:15] <eddiemonge> <img src="DSC00061(6).JPG" />
[22:43:28] <nathanw_> coldhead: its so much code, you'll have to view the whole page if that's ok
[22:43:42] <nathanw_> coldhead: it was working earlier I just changed a few things around and now its doing that..
[22:43:55] <nathanw_> but the form is still submitting, I just get that error and the post operations don't happen
[22:44:44] <eddiemonge> just paste the ajax call
[22:45:52] <acidjazz> so if i want to unbind a specific bind
[22:46:00] <acidjazz> i have to store the result of that bind cal right
[22:46:02] <acidjazz> call*
[22:46:07] <acidjazz> then how do i unbind?
[22:46:11] <acidjazz> pass that result into unbind
[22:46:12] <acidjazz> ?
[22:46:22] <acidjazz> var bob = $(window).resize(function() { });
[22:46:26] <acidjazz> bob.unbind(); ?
[22:46:38] <acidjazz> $.unbind(bob); ?
[22:48:20] <nathanw_> http://jsfiddle.net/awRUw/1/
[22:48:26] <nathanw_> i haven't changed that code though
[22:48:39] <eddiemonge> var bob = function() {}; $(window).bind(bob); $(window).unbind(bob);
[22:48:46] <eddiemonge> ?bind @ acidjazz
[22:48:46] <bot-t> acidjazz, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[22:49:43] <eddiemonge> acidjazz actually look at see? unbind
[22:49:48] <eddiemonge> acidjazz actually look at see ? unbind
[22:49:48] <bot-t> .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[22:49:53] <Louis11> anyone know why one of my faders would cause the page to jump back up to the top of the page? I have it called every 5 seconds using setTimeout . . .
[22:52:33] <coldhead> nathanw_: can you just isolate the bit where the error is occuring?
[22:52:43] <coldhead> because i don't even know where you're seeing that message
[22:52:47] <coldhead> in alert or something?
[22:53:55] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ Louis11
[22:53:55] <bot-t> Louis11, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[22:54:33] <Louis11> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/dcRz8/
[22:54:53] <Louis11> I've used this code before, and it worked just fine. But for whatever reason, now it wants to jump after each fade
[22:57:22] <nathanw_> coldhead: it's doing my head in a bit, i'm not sure where to start. I've never seen this error before , can you explain what it means ?
[22:58:53] <coldhead> i have no idea, that's what i'm trying to understand
[22:59:01] <coldhead> where are you even seeing the error?
[22:59:05] <coldhead> in the console?
[22:59:09] <coldhead> on a tshirt?
[22:59:19] <coldhead> is someone calling you at home and reading it to you?
[23:00:37] <bencahill> okay, this is ridiculous...I'm trying to debug a jQuery problem
[23:01:09] <bencahill> so I saved the source to a local file, and when I open that file, it works! but not on the web! WTF?
[23:01:38] <durre> this might be a stupid question :) I'm creating a jquery widget and I can change it's state with something like: $('#widgetContainer').myWidget('option', 'widgetId', widgetId); ... but what If I want to change 5 parameters of the widget? is there an elegant way of sending these parameters?
[23:02:09] <coldhead> bencahill: alert("To see this work properly please come visit my home or office") ?
[23:02:26] <bencahill> lol
[23:02:51] <bencahill> I've been literally trying to solve this for hours...it's code that used to work, but now doesn't
[23:02:53] <acidjazz> graci
[23:02:56] <coldhead> durre: you can usually supply an object literal of params {foo:1, pants: false, aidsL "lol"}
[23:03:28] <nathanw_> coldhead: hahahahahah - SORRY alert message
[23:03:29] <bencahill> but if I save the source and view, it does? I cannot think of any reason for this, except that it works since the html is static?
[23:03:40] <nathanw_> coldhead: standard JS style alert pops up
[23:03:54] <bencahill> maybe some html is dynamically created, and that's why it doesn't work live...
[23:03:55] <eddiemonge> bencahill: thats not really helpful since you arent actually describing what the problem is
[23:04:24] <bencahill> eddiemonge: okay, I'm in the WordPress backend, and I've added jQuery UI autocomplete to an input field
[23:04:49] <eddiemonge> nathanw_: what? you arent console.log'ing that shit?
[23:04:52] <bencahill> eddiemonge: it's pretty awesome, and worked great, until today...not sure what changed, but I have to work with what I have now
[23:05:03] <eddiemonge> link?
[23:05:06] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: ive read all of that .. still has nothing to do w/ my question
[23:05:19] <bencahill> eddiemonge: WordPress backend, i.e. pass-protected
[23:05:21] <acidjazz> can i unbind an event using the .bind's returned object?
[23:05:25] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: the unbind shows how to bind and then unbind a named function
[23:05:52] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: only by using the function that was bound, not taking in the case the function is not named, etc.
[23:05:53] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: no. bind returns the same jquery object that was passed to it
[23:06:20] <acidjazz> so if i have $('bob').click(function() { alert('test'); });
[23:06:29] <eddiemonge> bencahill: the whole thing is in the backend? its not a widget thats on the front end?
[23:06:32] <acidjazz> how do i unbind just that exact alert and not any other .click's on 'bob' ?
[23:06:34] <durre> coldhead: right you are! thanks!
[23:06:39] <bencahill> eddiemonge: this is so bugging me, I'll set up an account so you can see
[23:06:52] <bencahill> eddiemonge: correct, it's for data input
[23:07:09] <acidjazz> eddiemonge: how about var b = $('b').click(function() { alert('test'); }); $('b').unbind('click', b);
[23:07:46] <eddiemonge> var ale = function () { alert('test') };  $('bob').click(ale); $('bob').unbind('click', ale);
[23:08:10] <eddiemonge> acidjazz: again, click returns $('b')
[23:08:33] <acidjazz> oh
[23:08:47] <acidjazz> so i have to define the functions used in a .bind inorder to properly unbind them?
[23:08:58] <coldhead> nathanw_: you must be calling that alert, jQuery doesn't use alert() by itself
[23:09:00] <acidjazz> what if i have multiple binds using the same function w/ different parameters?
[23:09:12] <acidjazz> seems odd
[23:10:56] <nathanw_> coldhead: would a screenshot help??
[23:11:08] <eddiemonge> nathanw_: whats generating the actual alert?
[23:11:46] <nathanw_> eddie: not 100% sure, possibly the CMS
[23:12:04] <eddiemonge> nathanw_: search your javascript for alert(
[23:13:37] <impi> good morning guys,
[23:13:42] <various_artists2> I've got a login field with a watermark.I need to check if the field has been populated by the browser i.e. user has logged in before and browser can remember it. If not  load the watermark. Does anyone know what event I can use to check this as "ready" fires before the browser populates the field.
[23:14:18] <impi> i give a call with jquery to select a radio button, and it "looks like it is selected" but when i submit my form my validation return that it wasnt
[23:14:43] <eddiemonge> various_artists2: look an image placeholder or text?
[23:15:01] <nathanw_> eddie: ok standby..
[23:15:12] <eddiemonge> impi: are you using attr('selected') ?
[23:15:34] <various_artists2> The watermark is text in a div. Sorry is that what you meant?
[23:15:48] <nathanw_> http://jsfiddle.net/awRUw/2/
[23:15:53] <nathanw_> there's alert in the ajax call
[23:16:27] <JackBauer24> Anyone knows a good jquery plugin to display images in form select box?
[23:16:40] <eddiemonge> various_artists2: you cant use html5 placeholder?
[23:17:22] <impi> eddiemonge, im not hey, im using this: jQuery(".payment-methods input:radio[disabled=false]:first").attr('checked', true);
[23:17:27] <various_artists2> eddiemonge: Well the problem is it's not my code I am making changes to a large project.
[23:17:43] <mekwall> good morning
[23:18:04] <eddiemonge> nathanw_: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/awRUw/4/
[23:18:30] <eddiemonge> JackBauer24: like jquery ui autocomplete with a custom renderer?
[23:18:47] <eddiemonge> impi: use see ? prop
[23:18:47] <bot-t> impi, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[23:19:18] <eddiemonge> various_artists2: then without a high settimeout, im not sure of a way
[23:19:29] <impi> eddiemonge, thanks mate
[23:19:53] <eddiemonge> impi: you are using a version of jquery > 1.6 right?
[23:20:03] <various_artists2> Okay thanks, i'll give that a go.
[23:20:12] <JackBauer24> eddiemonge: thanks for pointing that out, I haven't thought of that. I will play with it
[23:20:18] <impi> eddiemonge, no :) im a little hesitant to upgrade will ease into it slowly
[23:21:24] <impi> i think my jquery code is correct, i think it my ajax call that return the new payment gateways that caches the old html? for some reason the old html is still visible after my ajax call when i view source
[23:21:27] <eddiemonge> impi: dive in headfirst
[23:22:05] <eddiemonge> impi: jquery doesnt change the "view source" code. look at in firebug or inspector
[23:30:33] <nathanw_> eddie: ok that's changed the response
[23:31:04] <nathanw_> eddie: now nothing happens when the submit button is clicked - but the form submits (i get the response email) , when its clicked again i get an alert from my validation script
[23:33:17] <nathanw_> brb
