[00:00:48] <flint0131> any one knows how to "smooth" this one? -> http://jsfiddle.net/k9Hq7/ i hate looking at the jumping text.
[00:01:28] <PERECil_> flint: use animate()
[00:05:17] <context> trisox: doesn't work here
[00:05:33] <context> trisox: your example is horrid by the way
[00:05:41] <Trisox> que?
[00:05:59] <context> closest() searches parents, so $(this) == $(this).closest(something) would never match
[00:06:33] <context> oh wait
[00:06:46] <context> trisox: but you did just make me realize how retarded i am
[00:06:56] <blackspotwiggins> context, closest() can match itself
[00:07:25] <context> blackspotwiggins: kk. did not know that.
[00:07:27] <NodeX> closest() goes up the DOM tree
[00:07:50] <context> thnx both, did realize what i was doing wrong
[00:07:53] <context> will have to fix tomorrow morning though :x
[00:08:00] <blackspotwiggins> but you cant compare jquery objects with ==
[00:08:07] <context> nodex: yeah, thought it started at parent not current :/
[00:08:11] <context> err!
[00:08:11] <blackspotwiggins> so you are true in that sense
[00:08:30] <context> .closest() is a jquery object
[00:08:56] <blackspotwiggins> $("#something") == $("#something") is false
[00:09:12] <trufa> I am getting "could not convert javascript argument" when calling a click handler that makes a json request
[00:09:12] <context> ok so that does not work
[00:09:17] <trufa> any ideas?
[00:09:26] <NodeX> trufa : pastebin
[00:09:27] <context> blackspotwiggins: im dealing with single elements
[00:09:39] <blackspotwiggins> i never saw your question, just jumped in :P
[00:09:40] <context> blackspotwiggins: anyway i can like .element() to match them ?
[00:09:51] <NodeX> me either lol
[00:09:59] <blackspotwiggins> ?.is @ context
[00:09:59] <bot-t> context, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[00:10:05] <context> blackspotwiggins: updating fields in a form, but i dont want to update the one currently with focus
[00:10:10] <context> or better yet
[00:10:19] <Trisox> context: use next();
[00:10:19] <blackspotwiggins> filter then
[00:10:25] <context> can i check if $(something) has focus ?
[00:10:26] <trufa> there's nothing to pastebin really
[00:10:26] <Trisox> i only saw your example..
[00:10:33] <Trisox> ?focus
[00:10:34] <bot-t> .focus(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focus" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[00:10:35] <NodeX> .not($(this))
[00:10:36] <trufa> firebug just gives that error
[00:10:37] <NodeX> lol
[00:10:38] <Trisox> ?blur
[00:10:39] <bot-t> .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[00:10:55] <NodeX> ? .not @ context
[00:10:55] <bot-t> context, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[00:11:01] <context> :/
[00:11:04] <context> i get .not()
[00:11:15] <context> .not(':focus') ? is there a :focus :x
[00:11:31] <NodeX> wtf lol
[00:11:42] <context> if ($('blah').not(':focus') {$('blah').val('update this thing');}
[00:11:50] <NodeX> .not() removes elements from the selectors
[00:11:59] <NodeX> that is not how you use it
[00:12:13] <context> i have multiple input items, when one is changed, it changes most of the rest
[00:12:20] <NodeX> context : how are you calling it
[00:12:27] <Trisox> blur?
[00:12:33] <context> BUT if i change the current, it screws with the highlighting since im binding to keyup
[00:12:36] <NodeX> trufa : pastebin your code
[00:13:07] <context> i want faster than 'change' so 'keyup' seems to be the next best thing
[00:13:27] <NodeX> so the current focused one is $(this); on keyup
[00:13:33] <context> unless there is a 'changeThatsFasterThanChange'
[00:13:46] <NodeX> so .....m $('your-selector').not($(this))...do-your-code
[00:13:49] <context> change only happens on blur
[00:14:02] <context> i think ?
[00:14:11] <context> yeah
[00:14:26] <context> so change and blur are practically the same
[00:14:35] <NodeX> err no
[00:14:53] <solidus-river> frum a ui widget, how do i get at this.options.variable from a method call?
[00:14:59] <solidus-river> i tried this.options.name
[00:15:02] <solidus-river> but its ays its undefined?
[00:15:02] <context> well tabbing into an input (it highlights all), clicking '1' doesnt trigger 'change'
[00:15:06] <context> BUT it did change!
[00:15:47] <context> but when you tab out of said input, then change is triggered
[00:15:51] <context> which would also be blur
[00:15:54] <context> since it lost focus
[00:16:09] <NodeX> blur is nothing like change .. they share one similarity
[00:16:13] <trufa> http://pastebin.com/02MDQa9u
[00:16:17] <context> on focus out
[00:16:26] <trufa> I guess the error is when constructing the json
[00:16:34] <context> change probably doesnt get triggered on focus out if pre-value == post-value
[00:16:46] <NodeX> 2nd time $('.your-selector').not($(this)).....
[00:16:50] <NodeX> end of story
[00:17:03] <context> i want trigger on keyup && change
[00:17:07] <context> not keyup || change
[00:17:30] <context> or maybe even keyup ^ change
[00:17:43] <NodeX> .bind( eventType, [eventData,] preventBubble )
[00:17:47] <Trisox> .change(keyup, functio .....
[00:17:49] <NodeX> eventTypeA string containing one or more JavaScript event types, such as "click" or "submit," or custom event names.
[00:18:03] <NodeX> bind('keyup change',function(....
[00:18:10] <Trisox> or that
[00:18:11] <Trisox> ;)
[00:18:13] <context> yes
[00:18:17] <NodeX> 5 seconds on the API revealed that
[00:18:22] <Trisox> indeed
[00:18:23] <context> which gets called on keyup OR change
[00:18:25] <context> not AND
[00:18:43] <NodeX> trufa : what line errors ?
[00:18:46] <context> tabbing INTO an input triggers keyip
[00:18:48] <context> keyup*
[00:18:55] <Trisox> not trying to be a bitch and all.. but api.jquery.com ....
[00:19:15] <context> i cant .val('') an input i tab into, or else it messes up the highlighting.
[00:19:15] <NodeX> of course it does trigger keyup.. wtf do you thinbk releasing the tab key does ?
[00:19:17] <Trisox> read that seriously if you wanna do more with jquery
[00:19:48] <solidus-river> grr, i need one state variable on a ui widget
[00:19:53] <context> thus..... how do i prevent from .val()'ing what has fovcus
[00:19:53] <solidus-river> why are they so complicated with these things
[00:20:03] <context> or only trigger 'keyup AND change'
[00:20:09] <NodeX> omfg... I have shown you twice context
[00:20:13] <Trisox> :D
[00:20:14] <NodeX> read what you are told
[00:20:22] <context> bind('keyup change', ...) is what i have
[00:20:22] <Trisox> NodeX: relax its still early
[00:20:25] <context> IT DOES NOT WORK
[00:20:42] <NodeX> THAT IS NOT WHAT I TOLD YOU TWICE IS IT ?
[00:20:59] <Trisox> context: make a jsfiddle plzz
[00:21:14] <context> nodex: i dont want blur
[00:21:27] <context> you have said blur, and gave me api docs for bind() and trigger()
[00:21:30] <trufa> the error is in an internal jquery file
[00:21:38] <trufa> jquery....js
[00:21:38] <NodeX> I don;t care what you want... you asked how you could not val('') the current focused elementr
[00:21:44] <NodeX> to which I replied twice the way to do it
[00:22:19] <NodeX> trufa : your script has to be triggering it to that erro
[00:22:20] <Trisox> true context try to make your questions more precise helps
[00:22:23] <context> ok! i think i got it. im too damn tired to try right now (as i said) but i will try tomorrow, need to change code a bit
[00:22:32] <context> right now $(this) isnt what it needs to be
[00:22:41] <NodeX> ignored lol
[00:22:47] <trufa> yes the error is probably not in the jquery library
[00:22:58] <trufa> so any tip for debugging this?
[00:23:02] <NodeX> It's definatley not in the jquery library
[00:23:05] <context> nodex: sorry. im tired as hell.
[00:23:36] <NodeX> there has to be something triggering it
[00:23:44] <context> trisox: yeah sorry. irc isn't as simple as seeing it :/ ill be back tomorrow when im full brained :/
[00:24:03] <Trisox> ;) making small jsfiddle snippits helps
[00:24:13] <Trisox> isolate your problem and post it..
[00:25:04] <NodeX> It's going to be one of those days today - I can feel it lol
[00:25:35] <context> trisox: yeah will do tomorrow morning
[00:25:42] <context> night all. sorry nodex
[00:25:50] <Trisox> oke good night to you sir!
[00:27:02] <veera> is jquery supposed to execute the code that is in i a variable, when i only reference it in an if statement?
[00:27:52] <NodeX> eh ?
[00:28:07] <trufa> that error
[00:28:29] <trufa> it points that one of the json parameters I use
[00:28:36] <trufa> can't be converted to the java datatype?
[00:29:14] <NodeX> java != javascript
[00:29:26] <NodeX> Which json parameter is it
[00:31:42] <amit_usual> is there a way to know that a request was made in a pop window
[00:33:08] <veera> Im trying to check if the value is equal to a specific one, if it is not equal, do something. But instead it changes the attribute to the attribute in the variable: http://jsfiddle.net/7UEmK/
[00:36:45] <trufa> so you say it doesn't even attempt to get to java
[00:36:54] <trufa> so it doesn't have to do anything with java
[00:38:42] <context> i imagine .attr('x', 'y') ALWAYS returns the same value
[00:39:38] <context> which... is an array
[00:39:42] <context> which never == 1
[00:39:50] <context> array or jQuery object
[00:39:56] <context> yeah nm jQ object
[00:40:17] <context> veera: hasValue never == 1
[00:40:44] <context> veera: maybe try .. if ($('#Code').attr('value'))
[00:40:57] <context> or just if ($('#Code').val())
[00:41:16] <veera> But i need to check if it matches the number?
[00:41:44] <context> then $('#Code').val() == "whatever"
[00:41:55] <context> .attr(x, y) SETS the attr
[00:42:00] <mekwall> veera: parseInt ... :)
[00:42:01] <context> doesnt do an equality test.
[00:42:18] <veera> Aha, thanks context
[00:42:27] <veera> now i get it, and thanks for explaining so good
[00:42:33] <mekwall> var numbah = parseInt($(elm).val(), 10);
[00:44:09] <NodeX> [08:36:42] <trufa> so you say it doesn't even attempt to get to java
[00:44:09] <NodeX> [08:36:51] <trufa> so it doesn't have to do anything with java
[00:44:16] <NodeX> You don't make sense sorry
[00:45:25] <context> nodex sounds a lot like me when im not slightly drunk and extremely tired.
[00:45:33] <context> sleep for real. night all
[00:48:57] <RaceCondition> if I set data-foo="bar" on an element, will $('#that-element').data('foo') work in all browsers, including IE6?
[00:49:08] <RaceCondition> in (X)HTML, not XML documents
[00:49:35] <RaceCondition> I would test this, but unfortunately I have no access to any Windows machines, nor could I determine this from reading https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js
[00:56:16] <NodeX> RaceCondition : yes I do believe IE6 is data compatible
[00:59:12] <RaceCondition> NodeX: thanks :) great
[01:01:43] <Nemitz> Hi, is this the place to get help regarding jQuery?
[01:01:55] <NodeX> lol
[01:02:02] <NodeX> What's the question
[01:03:08] <Nemitz> I have the LOF slider on my webpage - works like a charm, but i need to make the slideshow pause, when i hover the mouse over a slide
[01:04:00] <Nemitz> Question is, how do i change the LOF settings from my javascript file
[01:04:06] <Nemitz> will do a pastie of the code
[01:04:11] <NodeX> Contact the author lol
[01:05:05] <Spadeski> How do i limit the number of characters in a textarea and set the last three as dots with jquery ?
[01:05:46] <NodeX> bind a keyup and count the length of the val then replace the last 3 with dots
[01:06:55] <Nemitz> http://pastie.org/2642500
[01:09:18] <NodeX> cd ..
[01:09:26] <XeroBytez> anyone know of any good ajax dialog plugins?
[01:10:01] <juha_> morning peeps
[01:10:17] <luxigo> XeroBytez: jquery-ui ?..
[01:10:31] <XeroBytez> tried that, not working out
[01:10:44] <NodeX> Nemitz : you need to look on the author site of the script for a pause method
[01:12:43] <luxigo> XeroBytez: then try google "jquery dialog"
[01:13:21] <Nemitz> Ok, but what i'm actually asking, is how i from my function file can call the settings of the plugin. If you look in the bottom of the pastie, there is some functions to add to the plugin (trying that now) but how can i call the "this.settings.auto=false;" from outside the plugin, in my functions file (the pastie). Sorry for the bad explanation
[01:14:52] <NodeX> for that you need to find the method call of the plugin
[01:16:13] <Nemitz> NodeX: i have now added a method of playpause to the plugin (see outcommented part at bottom of pastie) how will i call that? It looks like playpause:function( manual, item ){
[01:20:02] <NodeX> the plugin needs a hook which is written into the core of it
[01:20:39] <Nemitz> how will i find that hook - i am trying to learn jQuery
[01:21:04] <NodeX> again see the author
[01:21:08] <NodeX> or the project page
[01:22:03] <Nemitz> Well there is no documentation, it's more about understanding jQuery, not sure the author is interested in helping me there :-)
[01:22:26] <NodeX> it's got nothing to do with Jquery... if you can't hook into it then you can't pause it simple
[01:27:33] <RockMeAmadeus> is it possible to chain a .live event to a .one event?
[01:28:01] <cypha> anyone familiar with jquery-tmpl?
[01:38:24] <pujger> What's a good way to spam
[01:39:00] <NodeX> lol
[01:41:50] <trumpete> Can anyone explain why my event handlers stop working if I call append() twice? Demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/8vStn/4/
[01:44:28] <shal3r> jquery fails to read image height when image is loaded but not disaplay in page. this happens only in Firefox
[01:44:29] <diverdude> What do the result and $.map functions actually do? http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1547660579
[01:45:14] <Nemitz> NodeX: thank you for your time, did not learn alot, but i hacked the plugin to do what i want :-)
[01:48:02] <trumpete> Related question: I know for performance reasons it is best to build up elements *before* adding them to the DOM. Does this apply to events as well - should they be bound before elements are added to the DOM? Backbone.js seems to encourage this style of working.
[01:49:53] <ravenzz> trumpete I am not experienced on this topic, but it seems to be logic. Why would you listen for events if there is not any element who could trigger that event?
[01:52:51] <trumpete> ravenzz: It's really about keeping the code cleaner. When I work with Backbone.js I tend to build up all the elements in a backbone "view" and do the event binding so that everything is "ready to go", and then the element can be added to the DOM in one step.

[02:08:26] <hugifrb> Hi, I use the jquery plugin qTip to show nice tooltips. This works fine. My question is, is there a possibility to enable the tooltips for all elements
[02:08:55] <oquidave> hello people
[02:09:12] <hugifrb> at the moment I use $(document).ready(function(){ $('#id_of _element').qtip(); });

[02:09:42] <hugifrb> but then I need to add this qtip function for every elemet
[02:09:49] <oquidave> however it's not working ...any help thanks

[02:54:25] <veera> NodeX: No easier jquery method of doing it? :-)
[02:54:25] <cypha> makes no sense
[02:54:25] <quicksilver> veera: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[02:54:41] <veera> quicksilver: i love you
[02:54:41] <NodeX> veera : no ... you could write a plugin for it
[02:54:41] <nuba> cypha: dunno, different strokes for different folks
[02:55:00] <NodeX> that's text not the he
[02:55:01] <veera> NodeX: but quicksilver just linked?
[02:55:02] <NodeX> href*
[02:55:30] <NodeX> if your link has it in the text then it will work :D
[02:55:55] <quicksilver> well if it was the href you could use '[href*="text"]'
[02:56:15] <quicksilver> but my understanding was veera wanted it in the text not the href.
[02:56:39] <amit_usual> is it possible to popup a window inside facebook iframe

[02:58:39] <BleKohl> Is it possible to combine two contexts?

[02:59:08] <NodeX> you dont need to .. the find is ambiguous
[02:59:20] <NodeX> add() would add the whole selector
[02:59:20] <BleKohl> What do you mean?
[02:59:25] <BleKohl> Uh
[02:59:37] <blackspotwiggins> Blegh, just do $(".foo")

[02:59:53] <NodeX> +)
[03:00:11] <BleKohl> I'm looking for '.foo' in data I loaded with AJAX if it wasn't clear
[03:00:29] <NodeX> add a context
[03:00:35] <BleKohl> how
[03:00:54] <NodeX> $('.foo',$("#the-ajax-response-div"))...
[03:01:08] <BleKohl> Uh, that's what I'm doing?
[03:01:10] <NodeX> will get all .foo's in the element you updated from an ajax call
[03:01:17] <BleKohl> the response is already in $(data)
[03:01:40] <NodeX> ok evidently you know more than me so continue
[03:02:00] <BleKohl> And lol, putting the response in a div
[03:02:14] <NodeX> wth are you on about
[03:02:38] <solars> hey, can anyone tell me why this doesn't work with a checkbox? https://gist.github.com/1264080 it does what I want, but somehow the checkbox is not checked then - how do I have to change this?
[03:03:16] <NodeX> disabled is not a checkbox way of checking it ...
[03:03:35] <NodeX> $("#your-checkbox").prop("checked",true);
[03:03:50] <solars> sorry, what Im doing is, if I click on the checkbox ( if it is checked) an input field is enabled
[03:04:06] <UglyBOB> i'm trying to output this inside a div: $("#regresult").html("okkkkkk");
[03:04:08] <solars> so disabled affects the input, when I click on the checkbox
[03:04:10] <UglyBOB> but it doesn't show
[03:04:23] <solars> NodeX, but somehow the checkbox is then not checked
[03:04:29] <UglyBOB> this is the div: <div id='#regresult'></div>
[03:04:32] <NodeX> jsfiddle solars
[03:04:32] <oquidave> hello, how come jquery does not seem to notice that an element has two or more classes
[03:04:49] <UglyBOB> ah crap, nvm
[03:04:54] <NodeX> UglyBOB remove the # lol
[03:05:20] <oquidave> like <div class='class1 class2'></div>, how can i get the two classes of this div seperately
[03:05:31] <NodeX> split
[03:06:08] <oquidave> i've tried using $('div ').attr('clas') but these will give me 'class1 class2'
[03:06:16] <UglyBOB> I try this: success: function(returndata)
[03:06:16] <UglyBOB> 			{
[03:06:16] <UglyBOB> 				$("#regresult").html(returndata);
[03:06:16] <UglyBOB> 			}
[03:06:22] <UglyBOB> and it doesn't show
[03:07:40] <NodeX> oquidave : var c= $().attr('class'); var cc=c.split(" "); .. now your classes are in array cc ... cc[0], cc[1]..
[03:07:40] <solars> NodeX, hope that works: http://jsfiddle.net/Ea7hC/ the toggle is okay, but the checkbox not checked
[03:08:31] <oquidave> NodeX, thanks it will surely work
[03:08:42] <NodeX> solars : toggle hides / shows things
[03:08:55] <oquidave> NodeX, will try it out

[03:09:42] <gsommer> I'm trying to get tablesort to work with dates - but with limited luck. I've simplified an example here... What am I missing for sorting correctly by date?  (dd/mm/yyyy format)  -> http://it.pharmanord.dk/tablesort/test.html
[03:13:51] <jqueryuser> hi to all
[04:04:18] <Weedjo> hey everyone, I'm looking for a function to "click" automatically at a <a href...> part of an HTML-page for a firefox addon. inside the a href is an ajax call
[04:05:28] <Cork> Weedjo: web content can't click a link
[04:05:45] <Cork> it can trigger click callbacks, but not the "load link" function
[04:07:26] <NodeX> Cork : It can!
[04:07:38] <Weedjo> how?
[04:07:39] <NodeX> $("#my-link").click();
[04:07:41] <Cork> NodeX: no, the browser will block it
[04:07:50] <Cork> that won't trigger the load event
[04:07:55] <Weedjo> I tried .click()  but it wasn't working
[04:07:59] <Cork> only the click events thats bound to it
[04:08:16] <NodeX> He never said anything about the load event
[04:08:23] <Cork> he did
[04:08:25] <Weedjo> ok, so I have to write the ajax request on my own?
[04:08:33] <NodeX> [12:04:15] <Weedjo> hey everyone, I'm looking for a function to "click" automatically at a <a href...> part of an HTML-page for a firefox addon. inside the a href is an ajax call
[04:08:39] <NodeX> am I blind ?
[04:08:53] <Cork> '"click" automatically at a <a href...> part of an HTML-page'
[04:09:03] <NodeX> what part of that says "Load"
[04:09:13] <Weedjo> sorry, i meant loading ;)
[04:09:20] <NodeX> RIght ...
[04:09:21] <Cork> maybe its just be reading too much into it :)
[04:09:23] <Weedjo> [13:08] <Weedjo> ok, so I have to write the ajax request on my own?
[04:09:31] <Cork> Weedjo: ajax can't really fix it either
[04:09:37] <Cork> as that won't replace the current page
[04:09:48] <Weedjo> oh boy :(
[04:09:50] <Cork> Weedjo: what you need to do is do something like window.location = a.href
[04:10:24] <Cork> or to do it the jquery way :)
[04:10:44] <Cork> window.location = $('a').eq(0).attr('href');
[04:10:55] <gsommer> I'm trying to get tablesort to work with dates - but with limited luck. I've simplified an example here... What am I missing for sorting correctly by date?  (dd/mm/yyyy format)  -> http://it.pharmanord.dk/tablesort/test.html
[04:11:09] <Weedjo> well i explain my problem: i want to write an addon which reads the facebook-privacy settings. and if you go there you'll see a lot of "edit settings..." which open ajax-dialog windows. i tried to make it click with click() but it doesn't work and I tried to "fake" the ajax: http://pastie.org/private/qdszxbfozwo4goc7h2zqg
[04:12:07] <Cork> Weedjo: check if the code runs a function and call it instead
[04:12:09] <Weedjo> the problem with you window.location: if I set the browser on the link (http://www.facebook.com/ajax/settings/privacy/connect.php), then it just goes to the startpage of facebook instead of loading the dialog...
[04:12:29] <Weedjo> ok wait
[04:12:34] <Cork> Weedjo: ok, so your not interesting in physically clicking a link
[04:12:46] <Cork> thats what it does namely
[04:14:39] <Weedjo> i just want to get access to the DOM-Node of the dialog-window which pops out when I click the link ;)
[04:20:00] <Weedjo> that is the ajax-answer http://pastie.org/private/gk7fnfkretolkqd8xlmqhw
[04:20:03] <Weedjo> any idea?
[04:25:51] <diverdude> How do I parse an array to json objects?
[04:26:49] <xec> json can be an array iirc
[04:27:14] <diverdude> xec, well its parsed incorrectly in my autocomplete when i set it as source
[04:27:58] <xec> maybe the autocomplete is looking for a specific named property? show us your code?
[04:30:39] <diverdude> xec, here: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1390045274
[04:30:45] <diverdude> the interesting part is in line 22
[04:31:00] <diverdude> what would be the correct way to return the data
[04:31:16] <diverdude> xec, getJSON is wrong for sure.. (i just tested that)
[04:31:45] <xec> doesn't your data var already contain json?
[04:32:19] <aaronmcadam> hmm I want to set a var in firebug
[04:32:27] <diverdude> xec, yes...but in the autocomplete textbox its just being parsed as one character in one line
[04:33:07] <diverdude> xec, do you understand what i mean?
[04:33:16] <xec> not entirely, no
[04:37:23] <xec> diverdude: have you looked at http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[04:41:15] <diverdude> xec, yes thats the one i have been using
[04:41:26] <diverdude> xec, however i cant make it work
[04:44:01] <ericincoldohio> we upgraded browsers from ie7 to ie8.  There is a jquery ui dialog with buttons in it.  When users click on them, it takes two clicks to register.  Anyone ever hear of an issue like this?
[04:45:50] <jibberJabba> hi whats the best way to do browser tests, i know there are tools out there to emulate but i've also read that it is accurate from cs and js point of view
[04:47:26] <cwl77> hi, does anyone know how to increment to the next value for one selector, while already inside a loop for another?  trying to wrap link around image selector but when i refer to the link i only get first one.
[04:47:49] <Weedjo> does anyone knows why I get an error "Error! Status = 200" when I use this jQuery-Ajax command? http://pastie.org/private/qdszxbfozwo4goc7h2zqg When I look with Firebug the requests and answers are the same of my ajax call and the "manual"-made
[04:51:27] <seutje> cwl77: got coads?
[04:51:27] <diverdude> xec, jQuery.parseJSON() was what i was looking for :) Maybe its also good for you to know :)
[04:52:05] <cwl77> seutje: sorry whats that
[04:52:33] <seutje> ?paste @ cwl77
[04:52:34] <bot-t> cwl77, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:53:19] <cwl77> seutje: done that,  what now?
[04:55:07] <seutje> lol rly?
[04:55:30] <seutje> lemme guess the random hash real quick
[04:57:09] <diverdude> when using jquery UI autocomplete, it seems that the if i make a function call in the source-option....this function is called everytime the autocomplete is calling search() method. Why is that?
[04:57:39] <blackspotwiggins> diverdude, that's how it's designed
[04:57:49] <blackspotwiggins> you are given the option to make an ajax request for example
[04:58:23] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins, but....im making ajax request inside this function call in the source-option....that means this ajax call is being done every time
[04:58:31] <blackspotwiggins> well duh
[04:58:33] <diverdude> i am fetching my source using the ajax call
[04:58:41] <blackspotwiggins> that's the point
[04:58:45] <gsommer> I'm trying to get tablesort to work with dates - but with limited luck. I've simplified an example here... What am I missing for sorting correctly by date?  (dd/mm/yyyy format) ->  http://it.pharmanord.dk/tablesort/test.htlm
[04:58:56] <diverdude> but is should only be called once
[04:58:58] <diverdude> not everytime
[04:59:00] <diverdude> thats insane
[04:59:04] <amcsi_work> hello
[04:59:04] <diverdude> only at init
[04:59:07] <blackspotwiggins> why?
[04:59:15] <blackspotwiggins> your term is different every time
[04:59:16] <amcsi_work> how do I get the datepicker object for a datepicker element?
[04:59:21] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins, because the source is just an array which does not change
[04:59:30] <blackspotwiggins> why the fuck are you doing ajax requests then?
[04:59:38] <blackspotwiggins> just load it once
[04:59:47] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins, because i dont want a big array in my code
[05:00:05] <blackspotwiggins> tough shit, you need to have it anyway
[05:00:06] <diverdude> and because hardcoding is bad practice
[05:00:22] <diverdude> damn thats badly designed code that autocomplete
[05:00:26] <blackspotwiggins> who says you have to hardcode it
[05:01:02] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins, well thats the alternative....if not fetching from ajax
[05:01:04] <blackspotwiggins> if you load all of your autocomplete data at once, it doesnt matter if you do it via ajax or some other means, it's still there
[05:01:36] <blackspotwiggins> the point of source function is, for example, to make ajax request based on the term and only fetch the results you need
[05:01:49] <blackspotwiggins> but since it's so badly designed, write your own then
[05:02:07] <xec> lol
[05:02:34] <xec> diverdude: do an ajax up front, save the array in a var, then do your autocomplete business without ajax ;)
[05:02:52] <diverdude> xec, yep
[05:03:29] <xec> was afk, thanks for the parsejson link, didnt know that existed :)
[05:04:34] <diverdude> xec, but kinda wanted to avoid saving it in a variable...since i have a lot of autocomplete boxes on my page....guess ill have to make some array system then
[05:04:54] <cwl77> seutje: paste to you or main? my first time here,
[05:05:37] <xec> cwl77: if you have an url, feel free to paste in channel
[05:05:50] <seutje> cwl77: main, more chance of some1 looking at it
[05:06:07] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins, maybe its not designed then...but its lacking an option then
[05:06:58] <blackspotwiggins> so because you didnt understand how source function was intended to work, its lacking an option?
[05:07:08] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins, an option where at init an array can be fetched from ajax and this array (the source) will be stored internally and used for future lookups
[05:07:11] <cwl77> xec: thanks,  catching on slowly. havent had caffeine yet
[05:07:12] <blackspotwiggins> you are going to have to store the entire array anyway
[05:07:39] <xec> cwl77: what?? caffeine is *essential*!
[05:08:36] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins, problem is if you have 20 autocomplete boxes at the same page and need to maintain and pair autocomplete objects and source-arrays. Each autocomplete object should internally have its source array
[05:08:45] <xec> alas, i cant stand the taste of coffee, so i surround myself with energy drink cans
[05:08:51] <blackspotwiggins> diverdude, thats not a problem
[05:09:03] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins, no its easy to make bad its bad design
[05:09:15] <diverdude> bad=but
[05:09:24] <blackspotwiggins> wtf, because you cant handle 20 autocompletes its bad design?
[05:09:41] <blackspotwiggins> if you pass it an array, it is used "internally"
[05:09:50] <xec> then again, too much caffeine isnt good either *cough*
[05:09:57] <blackspotwiggins> if you pass it a string or a function, it's called on every search
[05:10:00] <diverdude> blackspotwiggins, i can easily handle 20 pairings, but it should f... be stored internally....
[05:10:24] <blackspotwiggins> diverdude, please go fork it. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[05:10:36] <blackspotwiggins> and create your own autocomplete that works, so you cant blame the tools anymore
[05:11:25] <diverdude> i should, but alas i do not have the time for that
[05:11:49] <Elephant> but you have time to be a better code designer than the people at jquery ui...
[05:11:56] <Elephant> rite
[05:12:01] <diverdude> Elephant, i didnt say i was better
[05:12:24] <blackspotwiggins> diverdude, go argue in #jqueryui-dev
[05:13:25] <cwl77> xec:  not sure its right, but here goes. http://jsfiddle.net/BBCGQ/2/
[05:15:18] <xec> cwl77: what is your code supposed to do?
[05:16:10] <inad922> hello
[05:16:19] <gsommer> I'm trying to get tablesort to work with dates - but with limited luck. I've simplified an example here... What am I missing for sorting correctly by date?  (dd/mm/yyyy format) ->  http://it.pharmanord.dk/tablesort/test.htlm
[05:16:20] <inad922> how can I get the tag name of the current element
[05:16:24] <cwl77> part of a slideshow. it works as it is now, but the url is the same for all the images (always first image).
[05:16:29] <inad922> so when I have $(this)
[05:16:35] <inad922> how can I get it's tag name ?
[05:16:54] <blackspotwiggins> this.tagName ?
[05:19:58] <cwl77> i would like  the images to be clickable, so they open the url assigned to it.
[05:20:39] <cwl77> at the moment, it  wraps only the first link and uses that for all of the images.
[05:21:17] <xec> cwl77: http://jsfiddle.net/BBCGQ/4/
[05:22:03] <cwl77> lemme try that quick
[05:23:08] <inad922> thanks blackspotwiggins
[05:27:36] <cwl77> xec:  hi, nope, not quite there.  the link that should show up is the one in the div. (Page1.htm, Page2.htm..) looks like youre using the url for the image. the url on hover, is the last image for all images.
[05:28:55] <cwl77> jquery don't have an option to make the selector move to the next one in a loop, when its not the one being iterated hey?
[05:30:01] <inad922> If I define a click function for an a tag where I change some elements how can I prevent jumping to the top of the page?
[05:30:48] <inad922> ow ok
[05:30:51] <inad922> stupid question
[05:30:56] <inad922> I had # as href
[05:32:08] <ravenzz> ?preventdefault @ inad922
[05:32:09] <bot-t> inad922, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[05:32:37] <diverdude> I have a question...Lets say i have a page which has a lot of data on it in different controls and i want to be able to load the page fast, is it possible load the page, so that it appears and is usable very fast (no dataloading) and after the page has loaded, and behind the scenes while the user is doing other things on the page, the different controls on the page is populated with data?
[05:32:49] <diverdude> i mean can i spawn threads
[05:33:00] <diverdude> and let the threads populate the data in the different controls
[05:33:38] <xec> cwl77: if you can depend on the the html structure you're using to  always be the same, you could use .prev()

[05:34:58] <FinalAngel> does anyone know why $.('test', null); would not delete the cookie?
[05:35:42] <jcrawford> good morning everyone.  I have an .click event on a button where I am getting the value of a text field by id.  However the value always comes back undefined even when I enter a value such as 3 in the text field and click the button, any reason why $("addUsersQuantity").val() would always return undefined?
[05:35:55] <ericincoldohio> I have a UI dialog in asp.net.  It seems after a postback, the browser loses focus of the dialog.  The result is the user has to click on a button that is in the dialog  twice to get it to fire.  Anyone have any ideas about what could be wrong?
[05:36:46] <_dave_h_d> hi all anyone knows how to prevent the whole page submitting when you hit enter on a jquery ui dialog form
[05:36:47] <ravenzz> jcrawford if you are selecting the text field by id you need $("#addUsersQuantity").val()
[05:37:04] <jcrawford> god damn my bad :)(
[05:37:12] <jcrawford> thanks and sorry lol can't believe i missed the #
[05:37:16] <mcella> I guys, is there a way to coordinate multiple effects? I need to slideDown a div and at the same time reduce the height of another div equally to avoid scrollbars, any advice?
[05:37:17] <ravenzz> np
[05:40:34] <adrianp> mcella: you probably want the accordian effect
[05:41:28] <xec> mcella: what you describe is the default behaviour, http://jsfiddle.net/m2TqK/
[05:42:43] * muzone is now playing: Accordion: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpaonSDPw7Y
[05:43:11] <mcella> adrianp: yep, something like that I guess
[05:43:24] <mcella> xec: let me try with another animation that decreases the height of the other div... I don't need to slide it up entirely
[05:43:50] <xec> mcella: yeah just use .animate()
[05:45:59] <adrianp> mcella: or maybe this http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[05:47:03] <WasserDragoon> hello everyone, how to realize this: http://jsfiddle.net/HzDXj/
[05:47:55] <WasserDragoon> it happens in firefox that the text marker is positioned before the value of 2 if i use return false
[05:48:05] <WasserDragoon> didnt tested other browsers
[05:48:23] <_dave_h_d> hi all in query ui dialog forms, when i hit enter key it submits the form, what am i doing wrong?
[05:48:52] <WasserDragoon> as you can see here: http://jsfiddle.net/HzDXj/1/
[05:51:32] <Cizzle> @_dave_h_d do you have a link to demo?
[05:51:39] <cwl77> xec: thanks, but not working.   last url is now url for all images.
[05:51:43] <adrianp> WasserDragoon: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/caret ?
[05:52:54] <WasserDragoon> adrianp hmm ok i could set the caret position manually again but that's not what i want...it would be great to have the default behavior
[05:53:16] <WasserDragoon> because selecting isnt possible as well
[05:53:42] <_dave_h_d> Cizzle: sure http://pastebin.com/sKcbXkja
[05:54:33] <adrianp> WasserDragoon: if the default behaviour is to place the caret at the beginning, you have to modify it
[05:54:44] <adrianp> unless you want to submit a bug report to firefox
[05:54:53] <jugstah> if (!$("input[name='co_applicant_rent_own']:checked".val())){OnClickOrCheck()};
[05:55:00] <jugstah> can anyone tell me whats wrong with this line?
[05:55:04] <jugstah> I've got a ) out of place?
[05:55:16] <WasserDragoon> no, not at the beginning the default behavior is to set the caret on the position i clicked
[05:55:33] <adrianp> jugstah: you're missing a ) after checked"
[05:56:01] <WasserDragoon> i just want to check if i clicked the input, and if so dont go to link href (google)
[05:56:40] <jugstah> adrianp- doh.. thanks man.. just way too early in the morning for me
[05:57:22] <WasserDragoon> like this but i dunno what to do in the if statement http://jsfiddle.net/HzDXj/2/
[05:57:25] <adrianp> WasserDragoon: why do you have the anchor around the <input> if you don't want to follow the link
[05:57:54] <WasserDragoon> adrianp good question, but that's just a little snippet based on my real code
[05:58:51] <WasserDragoon> hmm maybe its better to avoid those stuff :-(
[05:58:53] <adrianp> erm post your real code
[05:59:05] <WasserDragoon> adrianp too much code and design stuff
[05:59:06] <adrianp> you dont need to use the anchor
[05:59:31] <adrianp> bind the .click() to child elements of a <form> and add a selector to exclude <input>
[05:59:44] <WasserDragoon> adrianp sure nvm i'll positioning my input relative to the parent of my anchor tag and outside of it
[05:59:48] <josh_> when retriving html from my db using getJSON it comes with /n/r
[05:59:57] <josh_> but it doesnt have them if i echo them out, what am i doing wrong?
[06:00:42] <adrianp> $('#form > :not(:input)').click(function(){ // go to google });

[06:03:48] <mcella> xec: tnx a lot, I've got it working, just one minor grip, the scrollbar is rapidly flashing when I slideDown the div, I guess is the small time that passes before I call the other animation to decrease height, is there a way to start both at the same time?
[06:05:10] <mcella> doh, sorry for my english (-> passes O_o)
[06:05:28] <mcella> I'm cooked
[06:08:07] <ck> @_dave_h_d I don't see any issues in your code. Do you have this on a page I can see?

[06:15:10] <diverdude> is it possible?
[06:16:41] <red> how do I return the data object from "jQuery.getJSON(node_load_php, function(data) { .."
[06:17:00] <red> (node_load_php is just a variable to my json thingies path)
[06:18:10] <red> I've tried { var foo = data }); and var foo = jQuery.getJSON... -- the latter method at least shows that I have an XMLRPCsomething as the variable, which has a .response with my data in it
[06:18:16] <red> but dunno how to access it from there
[06:19:15] <varnie> $('p'); how can I specify the paragraph's text into that selector?

[06:44:58] <Rushing> anyone know if the jquery form plugin dispatches some secret events for its ajax calls? don't see any in the docs...
[06:45:12] <jigal> seutje: this.id is undefined
[06:45:32] <erichynds> jigal: you're proxying the handler so "this" is no longer a DOM element
[06:45:43] <erichynds> try event.target.id
[06:46:31] <ftwordring> If I have a call to $('a').click and then load more hyperlinks onto the page through another jquery call does the $('a').click() still apply to those new elements?

[06:47:22] <darcyclarke> jeffsmykil console.log !== cool in all browsers... paul_irish's log wrapper on the other hand (http://paulirish.com/2009/log-a-lightweight-wrapper-for-consolelog/)
[06:47:58] <jigal> erichynds: does not work either
[06:48:03] <erichynds> orly
[06:48:22] <erichynds> are you passing in the event object to your handler?
[06:48:46] <jeffsmykil> darcyclarke: Bookmarked for great vengence!
[06:49:22] <daisy> hi - im using datatables with jeditable, with type:select, but i cant work out how to select a default value for the dropdowns - any ideas?
[06:49:57] <daisy> i've tried using selected: $(this).attr('the_key'), but thats not working
[06:50:23] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: I was in your neck of the woods this weekend
[06:50:36] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: were you at jqconf?
[06:51:21] <jeffsmykil> well your neck of the woods in where you live not where you were
[06:51:24] <jeffsmykil> I was in brighton
[06:51:36] <erichynds> nice
[06:51:46] <jigal> erichynds: this is my code http://pastebin.com/aHeXzPai
[06:51:50] <jeffsmykil> i like it there, its a nice area
[06:52:19] <erichynds> jigal: you want the form element? do e.target.form, or $(e.target).closest("form")
[06:52:26] <erichynds> yeah, brighton is nice
[06:52:57] <jeffsmykil> fucking $3 to get across the tobin is robbery though
[06:53:34] <seutje> jigal: oh sry, didn't know u were procying
[06:53:35] <erichynds> loool
[06:53:38] <seutje> proxying even
[06:53:45] <jigal> erichynds: tnx works
[06:54:00] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: the toll taker should have just held a gun to my head
[06:54:31] <Skizu> hey how do you remove the default action for tab?
[06:54:52] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: the best is when you leave the airport they slap you with a $4 tool
[06:54:53] <erichynds> toll
[06:55:04] <Skizu> Like, atm it tabs to a different element, I want it to do a tab in a textarea
[06:55:14] <erichynds> and another $1.25 every other mile on the pike
[06:55:23] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: it's for road "upkeep"
[06:55:31] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: @_@
[06:56:03] <red> how do I return the data object from "jQuery.getJSON(node_load_php, function(data) { .."
[06:56:16] <jeffsmykil> erichynds:  so they can keep the big dig going another 20 years
[06:56:22] <erichynds> YES
[06:56:33] <Skizu> Anyone
[06:56:35] <erichynds> red: impossible
[06:57:00] <erichynds> red: you must do whatever you need to do with the response inside that function
[06:57:17] <varnie> please help me.
[06:57:17] <varnie> http://jsfiddle.net/H76Je/19/
[06:57:20] <Skizu> It doesn't go to another element, but actually does a tab
[06:57:23] <red> erichynds: thanks, ok
[06:57:32] <varnie> why that line does not work?
[06:57:50] <red> its just a json, is it some security measure?
[06:57:53] <White--> red: You can actually use jQuery.ajax in order to send synchronous requests (which will than return the response object)
[06:57:54] <josh_> anyone know why this isnt working http://jsfiddle.net/43u4n/
[06:58:08] <erichynds> varnie: because item isn't in the DOM yet
[06:58:14] <erichynds> varnie: you create the element but haven't put it anywhere
[06:58:22] <red> white--: oh, thought getjson was just shorthand
[06:58:35] <varnie> erichynds, but the next line work
[06:58:37] <red> will try, ty
[06:58:43] <erichynds> varnie: oic oic
[06:59:24] <White--> red: It is actually a shorthand and internall leverages ajax(), however you cannot tell getJSON whether it should work sync or async, whereas you can tell the native function
[06:59:41] <diverdude> I am using the jquery autocomplete like this: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/909098360. The problem is that in line 30 where i do source: autocompleteSources, the array is always empty even though i assign values to it in line 12. Why is it empty? How can this be solved?
[07:00:01] <varnie> I don't get it
[07:00:12] <_dave_h_d> ck: the problem was that I had only one text field
[07:00:12] <erichynds> varnie: because appendTo moves the element around, it doesn't append on each iteration
[07:00:19] <_dave_h_d> and that was my form
[07:00:29] <_dave_h_d> so to fix i needed to add another and then hide it
[07:00:34] <erichynds> varnie: the 2nd line works because you are creating a new element on each iteration and inserting it
[07:00:35] <varnie> wow, it is tricky!
[07:00:39] <varnie> yes I got it!!!
[07:00:49] <Skizu_> Btw
[07:00:54] <varnie> thank you, erichynds.
[07:00:57] <Skizu_> Can anyone answer my question ?
[07:01:15] <Skizu_> Also that guy whos posted http://jsfiddle.net/H76Je/19/
[07:01:16] <varnie> I am just started the learning.
[07:01:24] <Skizu_> Try append() instead of appendTo()
[07:02:57] <Skizu> So can anyone
[07:03:15] <josh_> anyone know why this isnt recieving the JSON? http://jsfiddle.net/43u4n/1/
[07:03:46] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: luckilly i can avoid the mass pike 93 to 95 for me
[07:04:06] <erichynds> yeah that's the way I used to go when I lived up north
[07:04:14] <jigal> is it possible to move a div including its contents from one part of the screen to another?
[07:04:24] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: o rly? like conway north?
[07:04:37] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: vermont
[07:04:52] <jeffsmykil> oh so like 84 to 93 to 95
[07:05:00] <Skizu> josh_ i believe it's due to security
[07:05:06] <erichynds> yup, cept 85 not 84
[07:05:13] <Skizu> You can't load external bs with js as far as i know
[07:05:15] <josh_> Skizu:  can i not do jsonp on jsfiddle?
[07:05:15] <erichynds> 85 to hicksville
[07:05:27] <jeffsmykil> is that through bratlleboro?
[07:05:27] <josh_> bs?
[07:05:34] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: yeah I think so
[07:05:44] <Skizu> bs = bullshit
[07:05:47] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: I went to college in Keene
[07:05:58] <josh_> Skizu:  how should i do it then?
[07:06:02] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: oh nice
[07:06:10] <kborchers> jigal: see ?appendTo

[07:06:21] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: you go to UVM?
[07:06:33] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: nope, champlain.. just down the street though
[07:06:38] <kborchers> $(divToMove).appendTo(newPlace); it does all magic ;)
[07:06:40] <erichynds> sweet area.
[07:06:41] <jigal> kborchers: can i pick it up from one place and put it in another place?
[07:07:01] <kborchers> pick it up?
[07:07:04] <jeffsmykil> yeah so nice to drive through vermont
[07:09:00] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: are you from that area oriinally?
[07:12:30] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: nah I grew up on cape cod, went to VT for school, and moved to boston after graduation
[07:13:03] <jeffsmykil> ahh the cape, not as boring as the vineyard but still torture for a kid
[07:13:32] <erichynds> yes indeed
[07:13:47] <erichynds> especially in the winter
[07:13:53] <jeffsmykil> decent baseball in the summer though if thats your thing
[07:13:57] <erichynds> yup
[07:15:30] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: you catch anyone signifigant play in that league?
[07:16:24] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: yeah, I got to meet when they played down there jason varitek and jacoby ellsbury
[07:16:28] <erichynds> I don't remember anyone else though
[07:16:39] <erichynds> o_O weird sentence
[07:18:05] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: im thanked in this book http://www.amazon.com/Last-Best-League-Summer-Season/dp/0738209015/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1317824267&sr=8-1
[07:18:13] <jeffsmykil> we saved that guys laptop that had the book on it
[07:18:16] <jeffsmykil> no backup
[07:18:23] <jeffsmykil> when i worked at a computer store in college
[07:18:24] <erichynds> haha really?
[07:18:29] <erichynds> ?hi5
[07:18:30] <bot-t> 
[07:18:32] <jeffsmykil> left it bt an open window
[07:18:40] <jeffsmykil> poured on it
[07:19:12] <erichynds> did you see the movie summer catch?
[07:19:21] <jeffsmykil> somehow the logic board fried but the drive did ok
[07:19:24] <jeffsmykil> no i havent
[07:19:28] <erichynds> aww
[07:19:49] <jeffsmykil> you in it?
[07:20:12] <stongo> does anyone if there's a performance difference between using a straight up for() loop versus using jQuery.each()? ie. is one faster than the other?
[07:20:18] <erichynds> no, but they filed it in my home town, and jessica beil is pretty hot in it.
[07:20:22] <erichynds> filmed
[07:20:56] <gsommer> I'm trying to get tablesort to work with dates - but with limited luck. I've simplified an example here... What am I missing for sorting correctly by date?  (dd/mm/yyyy format) ->  http://it.pharmanord.dk/tablesort/test.htlm
[07:20:58] <jeffsmykil> man winters on the cape must be so gross
[07:21:15] <ajpiano> stongo: a for loop is technically faster but jQuery.each gives you a closure which you frequently need anyway
[07:21:46] <ajpiano> stongo: jsperf.com
[07:25:08] <Meehaw> Hello everybody. I'm looking at http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation#Isn.27t_that_nice_and_easy.3F
[07:25:17] <Meehaw> in example section i click "source code"
[07:25:23] <stongo> thanks ajpiano
[07:25:32] <Meehaw> and copy everything to new html file.
[07:25:47] <Meehaw> it doesn't work under ie.
[07:27:15] <diverdude> I am using the jquery autocomplete like this: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/909098360. The problem is that in line 30 where i do source: autocompleteSources, the array is always empty even though i assign values to it in line 12. Why is it empty? How can this be solved?
[07:27:34] <ajpiano> diverdude: because ajax is asynchronous
[07:27:50] <ajpiano> diverdude: there is a demo of using custom remote demo
[07:27:53] <ajpiano> data*
[07:28:11] <ajpiano> you use source: function( req, res) { // }
[07:28:30] <diverdude> ajpiano, yes ok...i have looked at that one....the problem is i want to load the whole array at init
[07:29:12] <ajpiano> so then what you should do is $.get("autocompletedatas", function(data) { $("#foo").autocomplete({source: data});    })
[07:29:16] <diverdude> ajpiano, iirc that demo looks up subresults on the server at each keystrokes
[07:29:50] <diverdude> ajpiano, aha, where do i insert that?
[07:29:53] <ajpiano> ...
[07:29:58] <ajpiano> you don't "insert" it
[07:30:04] <diverdude> ajpiano, ?
[07:30:14] <ajpiano> you change your code so that first you do an ajax call, and then instantiate autocomplete in the callback
[07:30:27] <diverdude> yes ok
[07:30:28] <ajpiano> i'm demonstrating the idea, it's not a magic snippet that fixes the problem
[07:30:30] <diverdude> that makes sense
[07:30:31] <diverdude> yep
[07:30:35] <ajpiano> ok
[07:30:36] <diverdude> just had to understand it
[07:30:39] <ajpiano> cool
[07:30:55] <diverdude> i could do that in document ready i guess
[07:31:01] <jeffsmykil> what icon for up hiarchy down hiarchy #nothingtodowithjquery
[07:31:41] <diverdude> ajpiano, thx for the tip
[07:31:46] <diverdude> gtg
[07:34:35] <_Brandon_> hi, anyone knows a slideshow plugin with progressive image loading, I have a lot of images and every slideshows I've tried loads all of them at once
[07:35:16] <xec> jeffsmykil: what context? usually, (in a file structure for instance) when going "down" a hierarchy, you would select a child element, and not have one icon to "go down"
[07:37:58] <dgx> Hey all. How can I make this feature when the user clicks on <option> once ot shows another element(<select>), when it clicks again, it hides/deletes the second <select>? So far I have this: http://pastie.org/2644037
[07:38:39] <jeffsmykil> xec:  yeah this is an <ul> so they dont contract and expand
[07:39:42] <jeffsmykil> there might be an ASP control that does that
[07:39:56] <xec> oh you mean, like showing and hiding a subset? you could use + and - like oldschool windows explorer or triangles like finder
[07:40:10] <jeffsmykil> yeah currently it loads a new list
[07:40:27] <jeffsmykil> its kind of funky the way the engineer did it
[07:40:35] <jeffsmykil> so i need to go back to him with some ideas
[07:40:38] <xec> funky good or funky bad
[07:40:39] <xec> :D
[07:41:00] <jeffsmykil> funky in that he made it work
[07:41:09] <jeffsmykil> and didn't put much thought into the ux
[07:41:26] <jeffsmykil> but i mean he's an engineer so what can i expect?
[07:41:43] <xec> yeah, that's how things usually go
[07:42:08] <varnie> bye
[07:42:08] <jeffsmykil> and then you beg and plead afterword for them to change it
[07:42:15] <jeffsmykil> and normally they say no
[07:43:31] <jeffsmykil> and then i usually get mad, call them a pretentious douche bag and the process starts again
[07:43:43] <jeffsmykil> "It's the circle of dev-lop-ment"
[07:43:52] <Skizu> Hey
[07:45:00] <jeffsmykil> the funny part is how much assholes dont mind when you call them a pretentious douche bag
[07:46:41] <Skizu> http://jsfiddle.net/m7WbM/2/
[07:46:48] <Skizu> How do i get it to work without the alert
[07:47:30] <jeffsmykil> what is keycode 9?
[07:47:51] <jeffsmykil> oh its tab
[07:49:04] <jeffsmykil> so what are you trying to have happen?
[07:49:13] <jugstah> i have a routine taht fires on keyup; how can i have it fire on page load/refresh?
[07:49:22] <jugstah> .change();?
[07:50:39] <White--> Is there something in jquery to generate a json string out of an object?
[07:50:52] <ajpiano> no, see ?stringify
[07:51:17] <jeffsmykil> Skizu: what are you trying to do?
[07:51:19] <ajpiano> meh, bot-t why are you sleeping
[07:51:36] <josh_> pjanoo
[07:51:46] <bot-t> no, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[07:51:54] <ajpiano> White--: ^^
[07:52:20] <Jayflux> ajpiano:  hows things? I don't seem to see you on this channel as much
[07:52:28] <ajpiano> fine
[07:52:31] <ajpiano> i am busy often
[07:52:41] <Jayflux> i bet
[07:52:54] <jeffsmykil> UGH the russian guy is on the phone
[07:54:03] <timing> Hi guys!
[07:54:21] <timing> Does someone know a plugin creating a scrollbar just like google and facebook have now?
[07:54:41] <timing> if it works on touchdevices it's even better
[07:55:38] <timing> jscrollpane?
[07:55:43] <Jayflux> ajpiano:  whats this .on .off thing about
[07:55:58] <ajpiano> lol
[07:56:07] <ajpiano> it's a unified API for event binding
[07:56:19] <Jayflux> is it what we should be using instead of delegate and live
[07:56:31] <ajpiano> you can choose to do so
[07:56:51] <Skizu> jeefsmykil, I want a tab to appear when I press tab :D
[07:56:54] <warrenparsons> Jayflux: You can read up about .on/.off here - http://blog.jquery.com/2011/09/28/jquery-1-7-beta-1-released/
[07:57:11] <jeffsmykil> Skizu: a tab? like a ui element?
[07:57:18] <Skizu> No
[07:57:19] <Skizu> Like
[07:57:21] <Skizu> Then button
[07:57:24] <Skizu> \t
[07:57:50] <jeffsmykil> so you want a button to show up when you hit tab?
[07:57:53] <Skizu> When you press it for example it normally goes to a different element like an a
[07:58:31] <jeffsmykil> so you are trying to change the default functionality of tabs that everyone on the internet is used to?
[07:58:39] <jeffsmykil> tabs == forms
[07:58:46] <Skizu> NO
[07:58:53] <Skizu> I want when i pres \t
[07:58:55] <jeffsmykil> sorry im trying to understand
[07:58:56] <Skizu> In a textarea
[07:59:02] <Skizu> For a \t to appear basically
[07:59:08] <Skizu> Go to the url and see what i mean
[07:59:10] <jeffsmykil> oh for spaces to appear?
[08:00:02] <Skizu> ye
[08:00:38] <jeffsmykil> like this?
[08:00:38] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/m7WbM/3/
[08:00:58] <Skizu> Kind of
[08:00:58] <Skizu> But
[08:01:08] <Skizu> I want it to appear where my cursor is
[08:01:09] <Skizu> Not at the end
[08:01:10] <Skizu> ;)
[08:01:24] <jeffsmykil> thats not at the end is it?
[08:01:50] <jeffsmykil> so use prepend?
[08:02:05] <aljosa> $("input").attr("name") works but it throws exception if there is no name attr, how can i check if attr name exists?
[08:02:07] <Skizu> prepend does where the cursor is?
[08:02:21] <jeffsmykil> no thats going to take a lot of work
[08:02:30] <jeffsmykil> like an obscene amount of horrifying work
[08:02:55] <jeffsmykil> such a pain to deal with the carrot in forms
[08:03:12] <Skizu> jeff
[08:03:19] <Skizu> You obviously can't do it so
[08:03:20] <Skizu> I cba
[08:03:21] <Skizu> :)
[08:03:41] <jeffsmykil> lol was that reverse psychology?
[08:04:14] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: http://teddevito.com/demos/textarea.html
[08:04:57] <jeffsmykil> so use his plugin
[08:05:10] <jeffsmykil> seems like a lot of code for the one little task
[08:05:35] <FiSHNUGGET> How can I get the server response is async is set to false?
[08:05:42] <FiSHNUGGET> is = if
[08:06:12] <Weedjo> I'm making a firefox extension and I've made a jquery-ajax call http://pastie.org/private/qdszxbfozwo4goc7h2zqg when I look with FireBug everything seems all right, but I get a "Error! Status 200" at jquery... how do I get the response data?
[08:07:28] <kborchers> FiSHNUGGET: why you no use async: true ?  async: false === bad UX
[08:07:48] <FiSHNUGGET> sending data array via post
[08:08:34] <timing> that's not a reason to don't do async?
[08:10:46] <erichynds> ?async @ FiSHNUGGET
[08:10:47] <bot-t> FiSHNUGGET, NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the users ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[08:10:47] <FiSHNUGGET> I thought you had to set async to false to send the data as a $_POST array, but now I see that is not so...
[08:10:49] <Skizu> ajpiano, all that for tab?
[08:10:50] <Skizu> I think no
[08:11:01] <ajpiano> Skizu: cool story bro
[08:12:33] <Phrogz> Anyone have experience in the fastest way to individually show/hide a large number of items? Using .show() and .hide() is only taking 50ms in JS code, but 1-2 seconds for the browser to update the 1500+ items that were changed. I'm hoping there might be a faster way (e.g. via classes?)
[08:12:46] <ryrych> does funcion have to be declared before running to pass jslint?
[08:12:48] <ajpiano> Phrogz: directly manipulating css rules is really fast, see ?jquery.rule
[08:12:50] <bot-t> Phrogz, Rule | jQuery Plugins - Important: The release listed below is not the last. Please download 1.0.1 from here . http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Rule
[08:12:51] <jeffsmykil> omg 1500 items?
[08:13:03] <ryrych> it works but jslint complains about it
[08:13:19] <ericincoldohio> anyone ever have an issue with button click stop workiing in a ui dialog.  But if you click again on them they do?
[08:14:12] <Phrogz> jeffsmykil: Aye; providing an additional filtering level on the methods of http://ruby-doc.org/core/....hrm, though come to think of it, the existing filtering seems faster than what my code was achieving.
[08:14:44] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Are you suggesting something like a unique class/ID on each item, and then changing the CSS rules for those items to show/hide?
[08:15:11] <ajpiano> nothing i said necessitates uniqueness
[08:16:06] <Phrogz> ajpiano: True, but I said "individually show/hide", so in the case where I need to uniquely turn on/off each item, I'd need that. But a good point, on the methods side they're actually in clumps and groups per class already.
[08:16:50] <ericincoldohio> phrogz, what are the items in, a table?
[08:16:55] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Off the cuff, do you guess that if I wanted to show all methods on that URL for a particular set of classes that it would be faster to change CSS rules versus calling .show/hide on each row?
[08:17:11] <Phrogz> ericincoldohio: No, individual <p> 'rows': http://ruby-doc.org/core/
[08:17:42] <ajpiano> probably the former
[08:18:04] <Phrogz> ajpiano: OK, thanks for your wisdom. I'll embark upon that path.
[08:18:12] <jeffsmykil> are those <p> cached?
[08:18:22] <jeffsmykil> or are you doing an ajax call every time?
[08:18:54] <Phrogz> jeffsmykil: No, they're raw in the DOM.
[08:20:15] <jeffsmykil> there has to be a better way to do that then hiding and showing
[08:20:16] <jeffsmykil> ?
[08:20:24] <Phrogz> I'll describe my goal (which I have working) in case it helps: right now, you can type in one of the filters on that page to filter that particular list. I'm adding additional functionality that filtering for a set of classes will only show the set of methods for those classes. Conversely, filtering the methods should show only those classes that own the methods being displayed.
[08:20:44] <jeffsmykil> would a query on a db be faster?
[08:21:20] <Phrogz> jeffsmykil: You're suggesting an AJAX HTTP request/response pair and a database hit instead of looping over 1500 items in JS and changing their visibility (which only takes 50ms in JS)?
[08:21:32] <jeffsmykil> yeah touche
[08:21:44] <jeffsmykil> but it is taking 2 seconds to show hide
[08:22:26] <Phrogz> Yes (or so...I'm not sure how to accurately benchmark the browser update after JS is done).
[08:22:37] <Phrogz> ...I suppose I could setTimeout(...,1);
[08:23:04] <jeffsmykil> that seems neither here nor there
[08:23:15] <Phrogz> Well, I need to know if I've succeeded when I'm done :)
[08:23:17] <jeffsmykil> maybe its just a matter of whether thats acceptable or not
[08:23:26] <jeffsmykil> i mean 1500 items
[08:23:27] <ericincoldohio> couldn't you wrap each group of P's in a div with the unique name related to the class
[08:23:29] * Phrogz goes to find numbers so he knows if the CSS rule-based toggling improves performance.
[08:23:34] <ericincoldohio> then just turn the entire div on/off
[08:23:37] <jeffsmykil> you are filtering you would think it wouldnt be instantaneous
[08:23:45] <Phrogz> ericincoldohio: No, because they are sorted by method name, not class.
[08:24:01] <jeffsmykil> so give them to class names?
[08:24:09] <jeffsmykil> two
[08:24:10] <jeffsmykil> wow
[08:24:14] <Phrogz> jeffsmykil: Yes, which is what ajpiano was suggesting.
[08:24:21] <jeffsmykil> thats what i do
[08:24:26] <jeffsmykil> but with far fewer items than 1500
[08:24:55] <Phrogz> jeffsmykil: Yeah...like I said, I'm noticing that the client-side filtering of method names seems to be faster than what I was describing as an update, so perhaps I'm either lying or it's using a better update method.
[08:25:06] <Phrogz> Anyhow, enough noise from me. Off to code. Will report back when done.
[08:25:20] <jeffsmykil> Phrogz: Im curious to know what you find
[08:25:58] <ericincoldohio> I'd just cache the query results...but I'm lazy like that
[08:26:24] <jeffsmykil> you'd cache every single query?
[08:26:32] <ericincoldohio> well if it's by class
[08:26:45] <ericincoldohio> thought he was going to make a drop down to setup the filtering
[08:27:07] <jeffsmykil> i think its real time typing filtering isnt it?
[08:27:43] <ericincoldohio> that's what I didn't quite understand...i saw the way his text filtering was working...
[08:27:59] <jeffsmykil> it doesnt seem slow to me
[08:28:02] * jeffsmykil shrugs
[08:28:05] <ericincoldohio> me either
[08:28:11] <jeffsmykil> i dont know if thats all the items
[08:28:13] <ericincoldohio> was faster than I could read
[08:30:05] <ericincoldohio> not sure why you'd want to filter 1000+ cryptic items..assumes the user already knows what they want
[08:30:34] <jeffsmykil> yeahj i don think that list has 1500 in it
[08:30:35] <Phrogz> To be clear: there's already the filtering on a per-list basis. My goal is to make it so that when you filter the classes list to get a few classes, only the methods for those classes are shown in the other list. (And vice versa.)
[08:30:50] <jeffsmykil> ooh
[08:30:51] <jeffsmykil> neat
[08:31:20] <Phrogz> FFS. Open page, type $('#method-index .entries p').length in the console.
[08:31:50] * Phrogz closes IRC channel to stop being distracted.
[08:32:16] <inad922> insertafter only works with elements already existing in dom and after works with anything am I right?
[08:37:25] <ohsnap> Hi guys! How can I target the children of $j(this).css({opacity: 0}); ?

[08:41:53] <ohsnap> thanks jeffsmykil !
[08:41:56] <ohsnap> Ill take a look
[08:42:00] <jeffsmykil> yup
[08:42:40] * jeffsmykil elbows ajpiano I HELPED
[08:42:43] <antihero> say I have a bunch of <span class="hi">, how would I get them to all fade out simultaneously?
[08:43:06] <jeffsmykil> give them a common class and fade that class
[08:43:15] <Phrogz> $('.hi').hide(100); ?

[08:43:49] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: one out of a hundred aint bad ;)
[08:43:50] <jeffsmykil> or fadeOut
[08:43:53] <ajpiano> congrats
[08:43:57] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: BAZINGA
[08:44:04] <kborchers> i kid, i kid
[08:44:16] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: I am finding the secret is to just point them to documentation they wont understand like you do
[08:44:17] <antihero> bot-t: But this drives my browser mental when I have lots of them
[08:44:20] <bot-t> antihero, What's so good about jQuery?  SitePoint - http://www.sitepoint.com/whats-so-good-about-jquery/
[08:44:30] <gnarf> it does all magic
[08:44:47] <kborchers> ?.box @ gnarf
[08:44:47] <bot-t> gnarf, Widget do all magic! http://jqbug.com/ui/7738 https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui-box
[08:44:55] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: see what I did there?!
[08:45:03] <gnarf> kborchers: :)
[08:45:29] <kborchers> gnarf: so jealous of your extra days. looks like you guys had a blast!
[08:45:44] <gnarf> kborchers: it was pretty damn fun
[08:45:49] <gnarf> tuesday was - well - not as much fun
[08:45:50] <antihero> The callback function, on fadeOut/In(), when done for multiple elements - is that called once or many times?
[08:45:51] <gnarf> but still awesome
[08:46:03] <gnarf> antihero: once for each element animated
[08:46:16] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: how many people do i have to help before i get the decoder ring?
[08:46:28] <Phrogz> OK, better timing data shows that the problem was NOT the browser. When I have only a few classes displayed it takes ~1ms to find the visible class rows and create a compound CSS selector for them, ~50ms to .hide() all the methods, ~6ms to .show() the right ones, and then the browser takes ~29ms to update the display.
[08:46:34] <antihero> gnarf: Argh, is there a way to get it to happen only once?
[08:46:41] <antihero> else I blow my call stack
[08:46:56] <gnarf> antihero: see ?p
[08:46:57] <bot-t> antihero, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:47:05] <Phrogz> BUT, when all classes are visible, it takes ~6ms to find the list of visible classes, 50ms to hide all methods, and...16 *seconds* to find and show the right methods.
[08:47:08] <jeffsmykil> Phrogz: that doesnt seem bad
[08:47:13] <jeffsmykil> oh there is a but
[08:47:13] <kborchers> ?9000 @ jeffsmykil
[08:47:15] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, [#9000] parseerror in jquery-1.5.1.min.js (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/9000
[08:47:20] <kborchers> damn it
[08:47:26] <Phrogz> Using a compound CSS selector is apparently a bad idea here ;)
[08:47:38] <jeffsmykil> yeah the find would be slow
[08:47:45] <kborchers> ?over 9000 @ jeffsmykil
[08:47:46] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBtpyeLxVkI
[08:48:07] <jeffsmykil> so you are linking the methods and the other stuff via common class names?
[08:48:24] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: im at work, no porn for me
[08:48:49] <Phrogz> jeffsmykil: I am, but then I'm finding them via       $('p.rb-ARGV,p.rb-Array,etc for up to 100 classes')  and apparently that's...not speedy :)
[08:48:50] <kborchers> :P, not porn silly
[08:49:02] <jeffsmykil> yeah find is going to be slow
[08:49:13] <jeffsmykil> someone told me that once
[08:49:41] <Phrogz> If you're interested, here's the current code hack: http://www.pastie.org/2644388
[08:49:43] <antihero> bot-t: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/487763/
[08:49:45] <bot-t> antihero, Couldn't find "http://paste.pocoo.org/show/487763/" in jQuery Docs.
[08:49:51] <antihero> gnarf: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/487763/
[08:49:52] <gnarf> Phrogz: what are you doing?
[08:50:06] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: he's doing some cool stuff imo
[08:50:23] <gnarf> antihero: there are quite a few problems there
[08:50:35] <aljosa> if i have "<div id="d1" /><div id="d2" />" what's the best way to replace div positions?
[08:50:36] <gnarf> antihero: first of all, don't queue animations with setInterval - its just a bad idea
[08:50:36] <Phrogz> gnarf: http://ruby-doc.org/core has a list of classes and methods. Right now you can type to filter one list or the other. I'm adding functionality so that filtering the classes causes only methods for those classes to be shown.
[08:50:58] <antihero> gnarf: I'm only using setinterval to calculate the scroll speed
[08:51:01] <gnarf> Phrogz: okay.... and why are you doing a compound css selector?
[08:51:23] <gnarf> antihero: you can EASILY think your way around this problem though
[08:51:30] <antihero> essentially I want all these elements showing when I'm scrolling, but not when I'm not
[08:51:49] <Phrogz> gnarf: The current implementation (http://www.pastie.org/2644388) finds the list of displayed classes, maps that to their class names, and then joins those with a ','. Now that I know that's the problem, I'll first try just looping instead of compound selector.
[08:51:56] <antihero> gnarf: so how would I do that?
[08:52:36] <gnarf> antihero: bind a scroll event to do a .show, and then debounce a timeout to do the .hide ?
[08:52:53] <gnarf> you probably don't even need the callback of the animate
[08:53:10] <gnarf> Phrogz: you can actually filter via a function
[08:53:12] <gnarf> you know
[08:54:05] <antihero> gnarf: Cool, how on earth do I do that?
[08:54:25] <gnarf> antihero: i'd help you if my plane wasn't pulling up to the gate :)
[08:54:46] <jeffsmykil> TRICKS ON YOU gnarf antihero is your PILOT
[08:54:47] <gnarf> Phrogz: instead of filtering on classnames, just filter on a function that does your regexp match
[08:54:47] <bmp375> gnraf: nice flight ;)
[08:54:52] <Phrogz> gnarf: I do; I had thought that using $('p.foo') would be faster by using getElementsByClassName or querySelectorAll where available versus me testing each.
[08:55:07] <gnarf> Phrogz: well, you already have it limited down to just the <p>'s right?
[08:55:13] <Phrogz> Yes.
[08:55:21] <Phrogz> You think the 'p' is slowing it down?
[08:55:26] <gnarf> so like, which sounds shorter, checking 10000 elements against 100 classes
[08:55:38] <context> to whom was helping me last night: thnx. got everything working now
[08:55:40] <gnarf> or checking 10000 elements against a function that matches an RE
[08:55:43] <gnarf> :)
[08:55:54] <context> haha
[08:55:58] <context> gnarf: neither.
[08:55:59] <Phrogz> gnarf: So you're proposing a RE that is the uniion of all allowed class names?
[08:56:18] <gnarf> Phrogz: depends on the scope of number of elements
[08:56:31] <Phrogz> gnarf 1-100 classes, 1500 methods to show/hide.
[08:56:46] <gnarf> yeah, just make a function for .filter() that returns true/false
[08:57:08] <Phrogz> (Aside:  looping instead of a compound selector takes it from 16 seconds to 26 seconds...so, that's not better ;)
[08:57:10] <gnarf> Phrogz: you might just wanna store something on .data() that says which method/whatever it is too
[08:57:47] <gnarf> Phrogz: is the content ever changing?
[08:57:51] <Phrogz> gnarf: I had considered that. I'll try that, as well as the union regexp solution, as well as (eventually) ajpiano's suggestion of modifying the visibility of 100 CSS rules.
[08:57:59] <Phrogz> gnarf: Not after page load, no.
[08:58:02] <gnarf> Phrogz: if not, while you're parsing the "method" or whatever
[08:58:11] <gnarf> just store an array of all the elems that match each "class"
[08:58:12] <Phrogz> gnarf: Yup, I'm there with you.
[08:58:35] <Phrogz> Almost guaranteed to be faster than the regex filter, I'll do that first.
[08:58:41] <gnarf> then you can be like allelems.hide() elems[ class1 ].show(); elems[ class2 ].show()
[09:04:30] <inad922> if I have a div with several children how do I select a range of elements  from them?
[09:05:24] <kborchers> inad922: what do you mean by range of elements?
[09:05:55] <Phrogz> inad922: By index?
[09:06:51] <inad922> Say I have 20 <img>s in a div. How do I select as an array from 7 to 13?
[09:08:37] <inad922> so like $('div img[7:13]').each(function () { do_something });
[09:09:13] <kborchers> inad922: $(div).children("img").slice(6, 12);
[09:09:25] <inad922> cool thanks kborchers
[09:10:23] <antihero>  bind a scroll event to do a .show, and then debounce a timeout to do the .hide
[09:16:36] <ohsnap> hey
[09:16:38] <here4thegear> using DataTables: I want a dropdown so that user can choose which field to search on or if it's a global search.
[09:17:40] <here4thegear> I can't remember where I've seen this implimented before but any help would be apretiated
[09:19:31] <jiduvah> this should be incredibly easy but I can't find anything that shows me how to do it. How do I open a new page in the same window with JQuery mobile?
[09:23:47] <context> jiduvah: the docs explain this
[09:24:15] <context> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc1/docs/pages/multipage-template.html#one
[09:24:29] <diverdude> How can i select a value in the jquery autocomplete plugin? I need to set the default selected value
[09:25:12] <context> diverdude: im personally finding the jq-ui autocomplete to be rather horrid to deal with myself
[09:26:38] <diverdude> context, why is that
[09:26:55] <context> im finding it to not be extremely friendly :/
[09:27:03] <context> that or im just using it wrong
[09:27:21] <diverdude> hmm yes...i think its ok actually...just need to learn it
[09:27:36] <diverdude> i have not learned it yet
[09:27:41] <diverdude> but still i think its ok
[09:27:47] <diverdude> it will save me some time
[09:27:58] <diverdude> but so far it has been expensive in time
[09:29:01] <inad922> if a tag has a class and I add style "display: none;" to it and then revoke it will that tag be displayed with it's original style defined by it's class or that's just not true?
[09:29:33] <kborchers> diverdude: use the search method of autocomplete to set the value and show the suggestions or just set the val of the input if you just want an initial value
[09:30:12] <kborchers> inad922: as long as you don't remove the class then it will keep those styles
[09:30:31] <inad922> kborchers: I see. Thanks for the help again.
[09:30:34] <context> inad922: it should keep it. you'd be better off just using hide() and show()
[09:31:00] <erichynds> naw, toggling a class is the best
[09:31:16] <erichynds> faster, and maintains a separation of concerns
[09:31:19] <inad922> If I want to do pagination should I just put all the stuff in a div and show/hide them depending on page or someway else?
[09:31:35] <timing> inph0: if the initial data is not that long that's okay
[09:32:09] <timing> but if you talk about 5+ pages with a lot of data you should use ajax
[09:32:16] <timing> inad922: ^
[09:32:27] <timing> inph0: sorry wrong tabcompletion
[09:32:42] <inph0> np
[09:32:45] <inad922> I see. Thanks timing.
[09:34:30] <treas0n> anyway to return a double not an integer from width() ?
[09:35:19] <razzi> treas0n, typecasting?
[09:35:33] <treas0n> Im having an issue with width calculations being off when IE zoom level is 105%
[09:35:35] <razzi> wait, this is jquery .. lol
[09:36:13] <swiggy> what is a goodway to create a hover-style information box (sort of like title="", only with more information inside of it.. no html - just text with formatting)
[09:36:15] <razzi> treas0n in js there is just the number type
[09:36:21] <swiggy> what kind of options do i have?
[09:38:26] <treas0n> dang no floats then...
[09:42:53] <Dirkos> How come that my jquery slide is not performing well? I have some code like: $('#recaptcha-wrapper').slideDown('slow');
[09:43:05] <Dirkos> its more like an instant show() than a slide
[09:43:08] <blindMoe> Dirkos: jsfiddle.net
[09:43:24] <blindMoe> copy your code in there so we can see
[09:44:44] <here4thegear> How do I create a drop down so that the user may select which field to perform a search on.
[09:44:54] <here4thegear> in datatables
[09:45:44] <Dirkos> blindMoe: when running http://jsfiddle.net/BkUsB/1/ it its more working as a shock than its sliding
[09:45:48] <Dirkos> in my dom atleast
[09:47:02] <blindMoe> it is probably a css setting you have on your end
[09:48:13] <Dirkos> well what could it be? Its just a normal div though.. i can show u a live version if you like
[09:50:30] <ravenzz> swiggy http://jsfiddle.net/KJw9v/
[09:51:42] <Phrogz> Alright, this is bafflingly slow. gnarf (and anyone else) check out http://jsfiddle.net/vnjJC/
[09:51:51] <here4thegear> Jquery Datatables plug-in, how do I create a drop down with field names for user to choose from so that when they type into search box, it searches on the field chosen.
[09:51:53] <Phrogz> Do you see the same terrible performance I do if you repeat the steps at top?
[09:52:00] <swiggy> ty ravenzz
[09:52:03] <swiggy> perfect
[09:53:19] <kborchers> Phrogz: wow, yeah that's bad ... let me see if i can play with it a bit
[09:53:29] <Phrogz> kborchers: My thanks!
[09:54:29] <ravenzz> swiggy a little improvement http://jsfiddle.net/KJw9v/1/
[09:55:06] * Phrogz is going to have a talk with the author of this data about better markup when this is done.
[09:55:27] <swiggy> yeah imma do some tweaking on this, but gave me an idea for what i need to do atleast
[09:55:39] <mattmtl> hello, using jquery how can I post a form of only not empty values?
[09:56:34] <Phrogz> kborchers: Interestingly, FF7 shows only 79ms for the browser update the first time, and 150ms for the browser update the second time. Totally reasonable. Chrome is borked?
[09:56:58] <kborchers> hmmm, i didn't look elsewhere but i too am using chrome
[09:57:19] <Phrogz> Two orders of magnitude is very surprising to me.
[09:57:45] * Phrogz goes to pull it out of JSFiddle just in case that's fucking with it.
[09:58:48] <mattmtl> but first, is it possible to post only a subset of field elements?
[10:00:42] <inad922> if I have $('<some_selector>').hide() will this hide all elements that's mathcing?
[10:02:28] <jeffsmykil> inad922: yup
[10:02:36] <Phrogz> Not a problem with JSFiddle. Same problem in Chrome here: http://phrogz.net/tmp/filtering-ruby-doc-core.html
[10:03:00] * Phrogz looks to change the CSS, see if it's a layout problem and not explicit styling.
[10:05:12] <context> WOW !
[10:05:13] <inad922> thanks jeffsmykil
[10:05:17] <context> phrogz: you broke chrome bad
[10:05:54] <swiggy> ravenzz, http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/QqJdZ/1/ what is wrong here?
[10:06:03] <swiggy> i thought i copied it exactly.. but its not showing up
[10:06:21] <swiggy> nvm i think i see it
[10:06:34] <context> phrogz: gotta be something wrong in the js
[10:06:34] <swiggy> nope nvm
[10:10:07] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with a js problem.. i dont know how big a job it is but you can give me a quote.. pm for details
[10:10:23] <ravenzz> swiggy the p is not next to that element
[10:11:02] <Phrogz> context: I don't think so; check my logic, but I think I'm only timing the browser update there. And again, Firefox is 200x faster.
[10:11:03] <swiggy> oh i thought .next finds the enxt p element
[10:11:07] <swiggy> so i need to use .find?
[10:11:09] <swiggy> ?find
[10:11:10] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[10:11:15] <garbagegod> hey guys, i have a question.
[10:11:23] <ravenzz> swiggy you could do something like $(this).siblings('.details:first').whatever
[10:11:41] <garbagegod> I have a page with an ungodly amount of different jquery versions in it, and i would like to be able to just use 1 jquery.js...
[10:11:50] <ravenzz> you should add the class details to the P element
[10:11:56] <garbagegod> but when i try to just use the latest jquery, nothing works.
[10:12:07] <context> phrogz: that filtering code should be able to be done with like 3 lines of code
[10:12:18] <garbagegod> it only works when i use 1.5.1, then 1.8.14, etc
[10:12:30] <garbagegod> but this results in the page having to contain like 300kb of jquery
[10:12:33] <garbagegod> wat do?
[10:12:48] <ravenzz> there is no 1.8.14 version of jquery :o?
[10:13:18] <garbagegod> hmm.. good point o_o
[10:13:24] <Phrogz> context: Do it, then :) And make it fast.
[10:13:30] <ravenzz> the current release version is 1.6.4
[10:13:35] <context> sec
[10:13:37] <garbagegod> jquery-ui-1.8.14-custom.js
[10:13:44] <ravenzz> well that's jquery UI
[10:13:52] <garbagegod> ah
[10:13:56] <garbagegod> there's a difference :(
[10:14:06] <ravenzz> yes
[10:14:09] <ravenzz> http://jqueryui.com/
[10:14:11] <garbagegod> well, thats cool, im sure you guys have had this problem before though
[10:14:27] <garbagegod> is there an "all encompasing" jquery version
[10:14:48] <ravenzz> just require jquery and the jquery UI
[10:14:54] <ravenzz> there are CDN hosted versions
[10:14:59] <ravenzz> so you don't need to host them
[10:15:28] <garbagegod> currently i have jquery 1.2.3, 1.5.1, and the jquery ui
[10:15:35] <ravenzz> garbagegod http://code.google.com/intl/it/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jquery
[10:15:39] <garbagegod> but if i take out 1.2.3, something breaks, and vice versa with 1.5.1
[10:16:16] <garbagegod> but it seemes like the hosted ones wouldnt be any faster
[10:16:19] <context> holy wow.
[10:16:23] <Phrogz> context: FYI, I've updated my local version to remove irrelevant markup and use absolute positioning (just in case there was some float weirdness); problem remains. http://phrogz.net/tmp/filtering-ruby-doc-core.html
[10:16:27] <context> ok chrome is just weird
[10:16:34] <garbagegod> local access vs network access
[10:16:53] <ravenzz> garbagegod that is not "local access"
[10:17:07] <ravenzz> the client is going to request the library
[10:17:12] <ravenzz> not your server
[10:17:29] <garbagegod> ravenzz: i mean ./js/jquery.js -_-
[10:17:35] <garbagegod> that is local
[10:17:42] <garbagegod> not relative to the user, to the server
[10:17:59] <garbagegod> but if it has to make a seperate request to google to get the jquery library, it seems like it wouldnt be any faster
[10:18:08] <garbagegod> is using hosted jquery libraries faster yes or no?
[10:18:14] <ravenzz> well if are developing a website that is going to be served within a LAN
[10:18:17] <ravenzz> you are right
[10:18:23] <ajpiano> garbagegod: the point of using shared CDNs such as google libs is that the user might already have the version cached in their browser
[10:18:33] <garbagegod> oh okay
[10:18:38] <garbagegod> i didnt know that, that makes sense
[10:18:39] <ajpiano> garbagegod: the way to solve your problem is to include the most recent versions of jquery and jquery ui
[10:18:42] <Phrogz> context: I do want to know why Chrome is so broken here, but it's time for me to go to ajpiano's suggestion of rule-based filtering, clearly.
[10:18:43] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. How do I determine the cursor position within a input:text element?
[10:18:45] <ajpiano> and then debug the issues that appear
[10:18:50] <ajpiano> from upgrading
[10:18:57] <ajpiano> not "include an ungodly amount" of jquery
[10:19:11] <garbagegod> but im not even intermediately good at jquery
[10:19:18] <context> phrogz: try doing: $('#class-index .entries p:contains(filter)').show(); $('#class-index .entries p:not(:contains(filter))').hide();
[10:19:21] <garbagegod> i dont feel as though i can debug any issues
[10:19:28] <garbagegod> id rather just leave those 2 libraries in there.
[10:19:31] <ravenzz> that's not the point. he can prevent the browser to cache that
[10:19:34] <ajpiano> garbagegod: what??
[10:19:35] <context> phrogz: seems to be fairly fast here
[10:19:46] <ajpiano> jqueryui and jquery are separately libraries, you *have* to have them both if you want to use jquery ui
[10:19:53] <ajpiano> that's not an "ungodly amount"
[10:20:01] <ajpiano> if you have multiple versions of jquery.js on your page, then that is an ungodly amount
[10:20:02] <garbagegod> i know
[10:20:10] <ajpiano> garbagegod: the only way to learn to debug is to debug
[10:20:11] <garbagegod> im talking about jquery-1.2.3 and jquery-1.5.1
[10:20:15] <garbagegod> whatever
[10:20:19] <garbagegod> ill just leave em'
[10:20:22] <ajpiano> ok
[10:20:34] <ajpiano> i'm sure that will magically fix the problem
[10:20:35] <kborchers> ajpiano: good effort
[10:20:40] <garbagegod> well, i take that back
[10:20:43] <ajpiano> as yoda said once
[10:20:48] <Phrogz> context: Where 'filter' is...what? Does jQuery support looking at variables in the local scope as part of the sizzle contains?
[10:20:49] <ajpiano> Don't, or Do Not - There is no try
[10:20:51] <garbagegod> the jquery 1.2.3 is actually needed for code i wrote myself
[10:20:57] <kborchers> hah
[10:20:57] <ravenzz> maybe you can put the minified versions of each library into the same file?
[10:21:01] <ravenzz> ajpiano is that possible?
[10:21:03] <garbagegod> i dont see why the code wouldnt work with any newer version of jquery
[10:21:05] <garbagegod> ill show you guys
[10:21:09] <context> phrogz: generate the string first
[10:21:11] <Brodingo> what if you like add all the jquereis together and get jquery 6.56.27
[10:21:13] <context> or even
[10:21:23] <Whirl3d> <--probably super simple question: how do you deteremine the cursor position in an input:text element? Googling it has only confused me more.
[10:21:38] <kborchers> Brodingo: lol!
[10:21:39] <Phrogz> context: But if you type in "ar" there will be 6 classes that need to be OR'd together.
[10:21:40] <vladikoff> Brodingo, you can only multiply them
[10:21:52] <context> phrogz: for the methods ?
[10:21:53] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: http://www.jquery-plugin.buss.hk/my-plugins/jquery-caret-plugin
[10:22:07] <context> phrogz: hide() all then show each class at a time ?
[10:22:09] <garbagegod> http://pastebin.com/VYwzbP9K maybe you guys can tell me why this would work with 1.2.3 but not with 1.6
[10:22:14] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, thanks as always.
[10:23:04] <Phrogz> context: Tried that earlier. That takes 22 seconds. If I put CSS classes on all methods and then     .filter( "p.rb-Array,p.rb-Marshal,..." ) for 100 classes I get it down to 16 seconds. :p
[10:23:06] <context> phrogz: personally in that method list id prolly use a data-parent="ClassName"
[10:23:08] <garbagegod> its actually not even the first part that dosent work, its the second part
[10:23:29] <garbagegod> the second document.ready function
[10:23:57] <Phrogz> context: I can ask James to add that, but that's already being added as a data value in the setup script. (Search for "owning-class".) But better than that, I have a direct reference to the list of methods for each parent (search for "method-list")
[10:23:58] <ajpiano> garbagegod: can you try a different pastebin, i can't seem to get to pastebin.com
[10:24:36] <garbagegod> ajpiano: its a really stupid problem, im going to fiddle with it for a minute and see if i can get it before i bother you guys with it
[10:24:42] <ajpiano> awesome
[10:24:43] <garbagegod> thank you though
[10:25:25] <context> hmm, is it possible to change an attribute on a css class itself in JS ?
[10:25:28] <Phrogz> context: In all these cases it's <100ms for the JS code to complete...the problem is with Chrome trying to update all the display:none/display:block. This is why I'm going to move to CSS-rules to try.
[10:25:47] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, if that is your plugin, the demo pages don't seem to work.
[10:25:55] <context> phrogz: gotcha
[10:26:03] <diverdude> ajpiano, using the autocompletion plugin, according to the custom data example where they have label and value, How do I if I have only a value set the default value of the autocomplete plugin?
[10:26:06] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: it isn't
[10:26:36] <Phrogz> context: Yes: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Rule
[10:26:55] <Phrogz> Still, I'm going to have to procedurally create the 100 rules (one for each class).
[10:27:03] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me with a js problem i need a lightbox working.. i dont know how big a job it is but you can give me a quote.. pm for details
[10:27:08] <Phrogz> This calls for more pop-tarts, clearly.
[10:27:21] <Phrogz> LekeFly: Try #css-lance, also
[10:27:46] <LekeFly> Phrogz: ty
[10:27:58] <ajpiano> diverdude: put it as the .val() of the input?
[10:28:29] <garbagegod> okay, its a little bit weird so im afraid i cant figure it out
[10:28:32] <kborchers> diverdude: which is exaclty what i told you earlier
[10:28:36] <Phrogz> Actually...before I 'fix' this, I'm going to pare it down to a simple reproducible test case for Chrome/jQuery devs to debug. This shouldn't be this slow.
[10:28:45] <garbagegod> http://jsfiddle.net/gsM7J/ can you guys show me how to combine those two document.ready functions into one?
[10:28:56] <garbagegod> because im pretty sure whats what's causing the incompatibility
[10:29:09] <garbagegod> the first document.readyfunction works but the 2nd one dosent
[10:29:27] <diverdude> ajpiano, yes but i dont have the string to put...I have only the key...so i need to do something like $('#inputfield').val(autocomplete.getValue('key'))
[10:30:23] <ajpiano> diverdude: so what is your question? i think you need to hack a bit more
[10:30:26] <garbagegod> it might be the way i did the click function though, i made this so long ago i cant remember why its that way
[10:31:20] <diverdude> ajpiano, so my question is given a key (NOT label) how do i find the corresponding label in the autocomplete box and set it as selected?
[10:31:59] <ajpiano> diverdude: i'd cache the data object somewhere and index into it
[10:32:16] <ajpiano> not going through the autocomplete API to just go look at a data structure you have a reference to alrady
[10:32:32] <diverdude> ajpiano, it should already be cached inside the autocomplete
[10:32:41] <diverdude> ajpiano, if i could just gain access to it
[10:33:45] <diverdude> ajpiano, like $('#inputid').val($('#inputid').autocomplete('getVal',key))
[10:33:59] <diverdude> ajpiano, isnt there anything like that?
[10:34:28] <garbagegod> crap
[10:34:41] <ajpiano> i don't know where you're caching it, diverdude
[10:34:55] <garbagegod> can you guys take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/gsM7J/ and tell me why the second document ready function would only work with jquery 1.2.3?
[10:35:37] <diverdude> ajpiano, i am not caching it anywhere....but when i do source:myarray when declaring autocomplete, it must store the data somewhere
[10:35:53] <ajpiano> diverdude: you should just use myarray yourself then
[10:35:54] <garbagegod> http://jsfiddle.net/gsM7J/1/ this
[10:36:06] <here4thegear> I have datatables plugin using server-side processing. Currently the "Search" is global. I'd like to present the user with a dropdown list of fields that they can search by and then allow them to type in their search phrase. How can I accomplish this?
[10:36:09] <ajpiano> the idea that you'd expect "it" to cache it somewhere and then give it back to you
[10:36:17] <ajpiano> when you have it floating right there for you to use
[10:36:28] <diverdude> ok hehe yes of course you are right
[10:37:03] <garbagegod> pleeeeeeeeeease :3
[10:37:11] <ajpiano> garbagegod: there's nothing about this code that is specific to jquery 1.2.3
[10:37:25] <ajpiano> aside from that it is  horribly horribly horribly non performant
[10:37:31] <garbagegod> non performant?
[10:37:50] <ajpiano> you're querying the dom for EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT IN THE DOM and then filtering the class by the regex
[10:38:05] <garbagegod> hmmm.. is there a better way?
[10:38:08] <ajpiano> that's how that selector is interpreted
[10:38:17] <ajpiano> garbagegod: give your elems multiple classes
[10:38:20] <garbagegod> i dont remember why i made it like that, but iirc it was because i needed it to act like a wildcard
[10:38:30] <ajpiano> class="test_cat test_cat_p-123"
[10:38:33] <ajpiano> yah
[10:38:40] <ajpiano> its better to just use multiple classes
[10:38:53] <Cameron> hello
[10:39:01] <Cameron> why cant i get this ajax script to work?
[10:39:01] <Cameron> http://vermilionsite.com/jsstuff/index.php
[10:39:12] <Cameron> in the console it says:
[10:39:24] <Cameron> Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[10:39:34] <Cameron> jquer.min.js:16
[10:39:44] <Cameron> *jquery.min.js:16
[10:39:47] <warrenparsons> You're probably using a single = to check for equality.
[10:39:54] <warrenparsons> When that's only for assignment.
[10:39:55] <objNoob> How can I return an jquery object for a dom element I already have referenced? or do elements have jquery methods already available?
[10:40:00] <kborchers> garbagegod: it may also help to let us know what happens when you remove 1.2.3 see ?doesn't work
[10:40:01] <bot-t> garbagegod, .load() - Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[10:40:08] <Cameron> no warrenparsons i doubt it
[10:40:08] <kborchers> huh?
[10:40:22] <ajpiano> lol
[10:40:23] <kborchers> silly bot
[10:40:23] <Cameron> i thin ki know what its to do with though
[10:40:32] <ajpiano> warrenparsons: you were right, he's using = wrong
[10:40:33] <Cameron> this bit: function(data){
[10:40:33] <Cameron> 		$('select#products').val()=data;
[10:40:33] <Cameron> 	})
[10:40:39] <ajpiano> Cameron: .val(data)
[10:40:51] <Cameron> ah thanks!
[10:41:01] <Cameron> i stil cant get my head round javascript :( lol
[10:41:02] <garbagegod> im giving up for now, maybe ill come back to it later
[10:41:24] <garbagegod> im not good enough with jquery to justify spending 2 hours fixing that function to save 20kb of page size
[10:42:16] <garbagegod> is it normal for the uglyjs minifier to cause a script not to work?
[10:42:18] <ajpiano> garbagegod: it sure would be cool if you showed some proof that it "doesn't work on jquery 1.6"
[10:42:40] <ProLoser|Work> spine.js vs backbone.js ???
[10:42:52] <ajpiano> backbone
[10:43:08] <ProLoser|Work> doesn't the _ dependency bolster the filesize?
[10:43:09] <garbagegod> ajpiano: maybe later, i would but im moving on to other stuff at this point, thanks alot though
[10:43:12] <BarelyFitz> Cameron: also you are selecting '#manufacture' when your select element has id 'manufacturer'
[10:43:22] <Cameron> oh woops thanks
[10:43:29] <ajpiano> garbagegod: your thoroughness is exemplary
[10:43:34] <kborchers> hah!
[10:43:36] <garbagegod> haha, i know
[10:44:07] <garbagegod> but like i said, i dont think my boss would be happy if i spend 3 hours fixing that jquery function just to be able not to include jquery 1.2.3 in the page im doing
[10:44:14] <here4thegear> I have datatables plugin using server-side processing. Currently the "Search" is global. I'd like to present the user with a dropdown list of fields that they can search by and then allow them to type in their search phrase. How can I accomplish this?
[10:44:18] <garbagegod> uglyjs breaks my script :(
[10:45:34] <here4thegear> all my google fu on this brings up ways to filter data but not close to what I'm looking for
[10:45:48] <teamcoltra_work> http://paste2.org/p/1689767 after the script refreshes it doesn't seem to "clean" the old data... so the marquee that was scrolling before still loads, and then the new data kinda competes for who is going to be on screen. Also how can I get it to load immediately when the page loads? Right now I have to wait for it to refresh before it starts
[10:47:18] <garbagegod> great, i cant minify THIS file either.
[10:47:19] <garbagegod> ffs
[10:47:44] <erichynds> garbagegod: do your scripts pass through jshint.com?
[10:48:10] <polygon-pusher> need help selecting http://pastebin.com/DPBj0Cn9, the idea is that I have a list of product divs each with a toggle button to show some more info about that product. I have tired jQuery('.company').toggle(); but I only one the one div just following the show_companyinfo not all .company to show
[10:49:21] <Phrogz> context: Fuuck. The pared-down version doesn't exhibit the problem: phrogz.net/tmp/massiverFiltering.html ;)
[10:49:32] <starsinmypockets> This is kind of stupid, but I'm building a form where I want to use a button to add form fields, however, I don't want the button to submit/refresh the page, just to trigger the jquery event...
[10:49:49] <Phrogz> starsinmypockets: <button type="button">
[10:49:50] <starsinmypockets> and append some  fields to the form....
[10:50:01] <starsinmypockets> Phrogz... k, I'll try that tnx
[10:51:13] <percious> anyone work with flot in here?
[10:51:20] <percious> i need to override the draw function
[10:51:26] <percious> trying to figure out the best way to do that
[10:51:57] <Phrogz> percious: In my experience flot is not easy to patch/extend. (I had to patch it to extract bar graph positions, and it was a horror.)
[10:52:13] <percious> well, i am just trying to tell it not to render on init.
[10:52:20] <context> phrogz: nice ;)
[10:52:30] <percious> easiest way is to pass a marker to the draw method
[10:52:40] <percious> but I can't even get the draw method overridden
[10:53:12] <percious> i tried this: http://pastie.org/2645051
[10:53:18] <percious> but my alert never show
[10:53:19] <percious> s
[10:53:45] <BarelyFitz> polygon-pusher: perhaps $(this).nextAll('.company:first').toggle() would do the trick?
[10:59:02] <PastorBones> I'm getting some weird behavior...would someone mind looking at the console output on www.fortpastor.com/multipleload/multipleload.php and tell me why the second console.log is undefined?
[10:59:33] <PastorBones> it's clearly not undefined as shown in the first console.log
[11:00:32] <Connor__> Question (More of a JS one but oh well). Is it possible to modify a variable value of itself without having to do myVar = myVar + 2;
[11:00:35] <polygon-pusher> Thank you BarelyFitz
[11:01:04] <PastorBones> Connor myVar += 2
[11:01:16] <Connor__> Aha
[11:01:24] <Connor__> Thanks :)
[11:01:30] <PastorBones> you're welcome
[11:02:51] <Connor__> @PastorBones does myVar *= 2 work>
[11:02:53] <Connor__> work?*
[11:02:57] <PastorBones> hmmm, after the first ajax call the array property is undefined, but subsequent updates it's not undefined...wtf?
[11:03:00] <ohsnap> Is there any way to make this a shorter code? http://jsfiddle.net/CkXam/ .info is a child of .destacado
[11:03:02] <PastorBones> Connor, yesh
[11:03:39] <enjoycrf> HAY!
[11:05:28] <BarelyFitz> PastorBones: when the page initially loads, "parsers" shows up as undefined for me. later it gets defined. maybe a timing issue?
[11:06:02] <PastorBones> in that console.log those are being output one right after the other...it clearly shows it IS defined (but I'm getting same behaviour as you)
[11:07:02] <j00bar> howdy! i'm trying to find documentation jqueryui's events - i'm not sure what the "ui" argument is to event handlers. anybody know?
[11:08:43] <PastorBones> I don't see events in the docs either -> http://docs.jquery.com/UI_Developer_Guide
[11:09:12] <PastorBones> J00bar: I guess it relies on Jquery events -> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[11:09:15] <ajpiano> j00bar: it's useful infomrationa bout the event, the contents of that object are listed http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable
[11:09:34] <PastorBones> or that ^
[11:10:17] <ajpiano> PastorBones: i think you're wrapping your thing into an array one too many times
[11:10:29] <j00bar> ajpiano: so for, say tabload, what sort of UI interaction is that?
[11:10:39] <ajpiano> j00bar: the tab having loaded?
[11:10:55] <ajpiano> PastorBones: var sorting = [[2,0],[5,0]];   	$("table").trigger("sorton",[sorting]);
[11:11:04] <j00bar> right, but the UI docs for interactions have draggable, droppable, resizeable, selectable, and sortable
[11:11:05] <ajpiano> now you have an array with an array with arrays inside, instead of an array with arrays inside
[11:11:09] <PastorBones> ajpiano, that's the way it is on the jquery.tablesorter docs (and it works after the first ajax call)
[11:11:38] <j00bar> ajpiano: i'm just trying to find even what object type the ui argument to the event handler is
[11:11:39] <ajpiano> j00bar: the UI widgets also have events that happen
[11:11:45] <ajpiano> j00bar: it's an object
[11:12:03] <j00bar> ajpiano: anything more definitive than "object"?
[11:12:05] <ajpiano> console.dir(ui)
[11:12:14] <kanzie> Im trying to re-factor my code to use the Module-pattern instead of relying on Globals under one namespace. Im curious as to what the general recommendation is on MODULE. Should each module be one class in my application or should MODULE refer to the application as a whole and I declare classes under MODULE like MyModule.ClassFoo, MyModule.ClassBar
[11:12:16] <j00bar> ajpiano: as in some sense of what it might contain?
[11:12:17] <PastorBones> ajpiano, I put the unminified back on there with the console.log output
[11:12:18] <ajpiano> j00bar: it's useful infomrationa bout the event, the contents of that object are listed http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable
[11:12:34] <ajpiano> it's completely specific to each widget/interaction
[11:12:53] <ajpiano> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[11:12:54] <ajpiano> etc
[11:13:09] <j00bar> oooh
[11:13:10] <j00bar> awesome
[11:13:11] <j00bar> thanks
[11:13:15] <JKarsrud> it's the bestests object alive :)
[11:13:29] <glauco29> hi guys
[11:14:18] <glauco29> I need execute a redirect if the mouse stand stoped per 60 seconds
[11:14:37] <glauco29> Javascript or jquery have some event to do it?
[11:14:56] <kanzie> glauco29: the idle-plugin works really well for this
[11:15:04] <kanzie> I think Paul_irish is the author of it
[11:15:05] <juha_> yay, i just got promoted to lead dev <3
[11:15:12] <juha_> also, we're hiring for my old position!
[11:15:14] <juha_> :D
[11:15:25] <kanzie> juha_: congrats, nice job!
[11:15:30] <ajpiano> glauco29: var t = false;  $(document).mousemove(function(e) { t && clearTimeout(t); t = setTimeout( function() {window.location = "http://somewhere.else.com";  }, 60000);    })
[11:15:49] <juha_> kanzie: thanks mate
[11:15:57] <JKarsrud> juha_: congrats! :D
[11:16:02] <JKarsrud> That's awesome
[11:16:27] <juha_> indeed it is!
[11:16:28] <starsinmypockets> Trying to append a variable to these attributes... getting unexpected string error - if anyone wants to do some schooling http://paste.org/pastebin/view/39224
[11:16:39] <kanzie> also, to further clarify what Im trying to achieve here is that my application has certain functions that can be grouped together into classes. Right now all functions are in the global scope under one namespace. I wish to use the module-pattern to group them and make them act a little more like classes. Looking at http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth I wonder if I should consider MODULE to be 
[11:16:39] <kanzie> namespace?
[11:17:07] <starsinmypockets> perhaps I need to wrap that in a function...
[11:17:11] <jugstah> the juha nick looks familiar
[11:17:41] <JKarsrud> kanzie: I'd make one global namespace that modules can live under
[11:17:47] <juha_> jugstah: popular finnish name
[11:18:13] <JKarsrud> kanzie: Check out this article from addy osmani on the topic of namespacing: http://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing/
[11:18:34] <kanzie> JKarsrud: so I do Application.ClassFoo = (function() {});
[11:18:43] <JKarsrud> The way I've done it when not using requirejs is like that, yes
[11:19:25] <JKarsrud> or using $.extend()
[11:19:46] <JKarsrud> for some deep extension
[11:20:59] <jugstah> juha- im sure ive seen your nick on #efnet
[11:21:06] <jugstah> prob not the same person
[11:21:34] <juha_> jugstah: possible that you've seen it, but i haven't been on efnet for years, nor i've never been on a channel called #efnet
[11:22:09] <JKarsrud> juha_: So, what are your responsibilites now that you're lead dev? :)
[11:22:25] <SnackWhack> can I select a table based on a "summary" attribute? I can'
[11:22:30] <juha_> JKarsrud: pretty much same as been for the last couple of years :P
[11:22:41] <juha_> JKarsrud: maybe little bit more meetings and interviews (hopefully!)
[11:22:44] <JKarsrud> SnackWhack: sure, using attribute selectors :)
[11:22:46] <SnackWhack> can I select a table based on a "summary" attribute? I can't change the code that creates this html, but I can hijack it with jQuery:
[11:22:46] <SnackWhack> <table class="dataentrytable" summary="This table displays all valid application types which can be chosen.">
[11:22:48] <JKarsrud> Cool
[11:22:55] <jugstah> juha- yeah i havent seen your nick on efnet in years either... ;-)
[11:23:03] <juha_> JKarsrud: and hopefully interviews that would lead into hires
[11:24:18] <JKarsrud> that's always a good thing ;)
[11:24:41] <JKarsrud> SnackWhack: Why not select on a class instead?
[11:24:48] <JKarsrud> if it has a class?
[11:24:54] <kanzie> You guys reckon a good structure for module-pattern is MyApp.views.FooView=(function(){}), MyApp.controllers.FooController = (function() {}) etc.
[11:25:02] <SnackWhack> JKarsrud: that class is used several times on the page
[11:25:09] <JKarsrud> SnackWhack: for tables?
[11:25:09] <SnackWhack> what you see is what I have to work with
[11:25:22] <SnackWhack> JKarsrud: yes
[11:25:25] <JKarsrud> hmm, ok
[11:25:39] <JKarsrud> Then attribute selectors are the way to go
[11:26:01] <JKarsrud> SnackWhack:
[11:26:01] <JKarsrud> http://jqapi.com/#p=attribute-contains-selector
[11:26:02] <SnackWhack> JKarsrud: actually, on this particular page, there is only one! YES!
[11:26:08] <JKarsrud> Cool =)
[11:26:23] <SnackWhack> JKarsrud: Most of this site uses that class on multiple tables per page
[11:26:33] <SnackWhack> ok, then select by class it is
[11:28:21] <PastorBones> YESH! Adding a callback to the trigger/event fixed my issue since the object property was being defined with a setTimeout
[11:28:50] <PastorBones> so now the subsequent method doesn't actually fire until the trigger has completed it's update
[11:30:46] <SnackWhack> JKarsrud: If I do use attributes does this look right? $('table[summary*=This table displays all valid application types which can be chosen.').hide();
[11:31:25] <JKarsrud> Just put the value in " "
[11:31:42] <SnackWhack> k
[11:32:40] <ngharo> missing closing ]
[11:32:55] <SnackWhack> $('table[summary*="This table displays all valid application types which can be chosen."]').hide();
[11:33:07] <SnackWhack> got it. anks!
[11:33:11] <SnackWhack> tanks!
[11:33:15] <JKarsrud> yeah
[11:37:39] <teamcoltra_work> http://paste2.org/p/1689767 how can I make this also load when the page loads? Right now it only loads after the first refresh
[11:38:44] <UglyBOB> Hi, I have a problem for the last 4 hours and I just am out of solutions to try... So I made some screenshots... I'm implementing an autoscale carousel...
[11:38:51] <UglyBOB> This is how it looks:
[11:38:53] <UglyBOB> Direct path: http://i.imgur.com/gEreA.jpg
[11:38:54] <UglyBOB> Webserver path: http://i.imgur.com/l8tfr.jpg
[11:39:32] <UglyBOB> it's 2 times the EXACT same page, and somehow in IE - if the page is loaded via the webserver, it misses something (I don't know what) and messes up everything
[11:39:38] <UglyBOB> and it works in Firefox for both
[11:39:51] <Whirl3d> If you can use $("[placeholder]") to select all html elements that have the placeholder attribute could you also use $("[somecustom]") to select all html elements with the 'somecustom' attribute?
[11:39:59] <UglyBOB> anyone has a clue what the problem could be?
[11:41:04] <Whirl3d> UglyBOB, it probably is caching the image in one or the other browsers
[11:41:35] <UglyBOB> no, i always refresh with CTRL F5
[11:43:17] <dabear> Whirl3d: yep, you can do that, although it is shit slow
[11:43:19] <MrNicerThenU> can someone here help me out javascript seems pretty dead atm
[11:44:10] <MrNicerThenU> im trying to have my info in a php form post to a javascript form and its into posting
[11:46:01] <Whirl3d> dabear, thanks for the reply. I really just want to add a "default" attribute to a couple of input fields.
[11:46:49] <dabear> Whirl3d: rembmer that $("[default]") is the same as $("*[default]")
[11:47:06] <shodan45> is there a method to move .sortable() items manually?
[11:47:10] <dabear> eg. it select ALL elements on the page, and then filters out those that do not have default attributes
[11:47:17] <dabear> selects*
[11:48:58] <dabear> shodan45: see ?append
[11:48:59] <bot-t> shodan45, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[11:50:16] <shodan45> dabear: doh. plain old jquery >_<
[11:50:22] <dabear> yep
[11:50:23] <shodan45> dabear: thanks :)
[11:52:43] <dabear> I guess you could trigger mousedown, then mousemove and mouseup on the <li> to get that animating effect
[11:55:00] <SnackWhack> can I append options to an array using jQuery?
[11:55:16] <SnackWhack> append key/value pairs I guess I meant to say
[11:55:19] <JKarsrud> .push
[11:56:12] <JKarsrud> but is it an array, or is it an object?
[11:56:42] <bapi_> In order to see if the user hovers an element, is it as east as .hover?
[11:57:17] <JKarsrud> ?hover
[11:57:17] <bot-t> .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[11:58:00] <JKarsrud> .hover(function(e) {  });
[11:58:20] <jonclark> is padolsey's cross-domain-ajax plugin the accepted standard these days?
[11:59:34] <Dave_Stein> hover is way superior to using mouseover and mouseout since it handles all the parent/child crap for you
[11:59:47] <SnackWhack> JKarsrud: it's an array. I'm grabbing the values and text from a drop down and storing that in an array so I can separate the options based on the values
[12:02:22] <diverdude> I have deployed the jquery autocomplete function which works very well now after some work. However, when the keyboard is used to scroll through the list, each object is highlighted and a value is displayed in the textbox. This is great, however its the key and not the label which is displayed in the textbox. How do i make it the label which is displayed in the textbox?
[12:02:49] <Jayflux> why is jQuery.parsejSON not a function
[12:03:21] <ajpiano> Jayflux: either cause you're typing it wrong, or because you have an older version of jquery where it doesn't exist
[12:03:30] <Jayflux> ajpiano im using 1.6.4
[12:03:33] <diverdude> ajpiano, do you know about this issue?
[12:03:34] <Jayflux> it doesnt work
[12:03:36] <ajpiano> then you're probably typing it wrong
[12:03:40] <Jayflux> im not :S
[12:03:55] <Jayflux> it autocompletes everything else parseJSON doesnt come up
[12:03:59] <ajpiano> you did when you typed it in here a minute ago
[12:04:07] <ajpiano> diverdude: try using the focus event
[12:04:07] <Jayflux> weir
[12:04:11] <william__> hello?
[12:04:13] <Jayflux> weird
[12:04:26] <ajpiano> william__: hello
[12:04:41] <Jayflux> ajpiano i will show you a screenshot
[12:04:43] <william__> I am wondering if you could help me with a quick question, I can't find it anywhere in the documentation?
[12:04:47] <ajpiano> ?ask
[12:04:48] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:04:56] <ajpiano> Jayflux: yay i love screenshots
[12:06:07] <diverdude> ajpiano, the focus event is not activated on scroll
[12:06:29] <diverdude> ajpiano, only on select
[12:06:44] <william__> I am using: $("#friendsbox").load('getfriends.php'); to load a DIV with information, this includes buttons with IDs. I was wondering how I would capture 'click' events with jquery as it won't recognise it like it does with pre-loaded HTML?
[12:06:45] <ajpiano> it's activated on... focus... via mouse or keyboard...
[12:06:55] <diverdude> ajpiano, sorry i think i did it wrong
[12:07:04] <diverdude> ajpiano, wait a minute
[12:07:11] <ajpiano> william__: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[12:08:30] <william__> Thank you! Been a massive help, jquery is so smooth to use, moving over from C++ with OpenGL!
[12:08:45] <ajpiano> np :)
[12:08:52] <ajpiano> that's not usually what people are moving over from
[12:08:55] <Ramka> He(eeeeeee)lp ... :-)
[12:08:55] <ajpiano> :D
[12:09:43] <diverdude> ajpiano, perfect...thx man :)
[12:09:43] <Jayflux> ajpiano my bad
[12:09:51] <Ramka> i've been struggling a few with executeSql and callbacks, i seem to be misunderstanding the callbacks, and closures. Anyone would care to help ?
[12:10:18] <diverdude> william__, what did you do with OGL?
[12:10:34] <william__> Haha, I really wanted to play around with AJAX as my experience with HTML and that family is that everything is so static... Jquery has made the web come alive again for me. Also, no need to compile ;D
[12:10:49] <bapi_> anyone familiar with any plugin that mimics the mybb "hold to edit inputbox"?
[12:11:08] <bapi_> basically you hold the mousekey over a input element and eventually you can edit the data
[12:11:22] <diverdude> ajpiano, finally i have set up the autocomplete as I want :) It took forever hehe
[12:11:41] <ajpiano> diverdude: i think you don't know how long "forever" is :p
[12:11:47] <william__> I have been making client>server games for a while now.. Also, I make tutorials for a library called DarkGDK on youtube called 'helpfullprogrammer', that pretty much sums me up. But a tad off topic :L
[12:12:00] <diverdude> ajpiano, haha you had your struggles with it also?
[12:12:04] <ajpiano> no
[12:12:13] <ajpiano> i'm saying that a couple hours to implement a feature
[12:12:23] <Ramka> i'm trying to get the callback put the data back in an array, inside of an object ... or to trigger a method of the object that will take care of doing it. but i'm missing something.
[12:12:25] <ajpiano> and the 4.5 billion years our universe has existed for
[12:12:27] <ajpiano> are way different
[12:12:28] <ajpiano> :D
[12:12:55] <diverdude> ajpiano, ahh hehe well true...i spent more like a couple of days customizing this :D
[12:12:59] <ajpiano> s/universe/planet*
[12:12:59] <william__> *Decides not to go down the whole relativity-time path :L
[12:13:17] <ajpiano> william__: have you experimented with games and JS stuff at all?
[12:13:34] <diverdude> ajpiano, good thing is that i have i now for all future projects to use...just to throw it in there
[12:13:49] <Ramka> :'(
[12:13:58] <william__> Oh now I dare say I have! I worked for a company called turbulenz which made an SDK for making console games in the browser. I learnt javascript in a week to make a 'pong' project.
[12:14:03] <ajpiano> Ramka: best case scenario involves showing some code
[12:14:14] <william__> I forgot about that.... Javascript is a lot like C++ in many respects,
[12:14:21] <Ramka> where can i put it ?
[12:14:31] <ajpiano> ?p @ Ramka
[12:14:32] <bot-t> Ramka, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:15:00] <ajpiano> william__: if you're on the west coast, you might want to checkout http://newgameconf.com
[12:16:18] <oojacoboo> anyone have any good .ajax() function references?  The API is decent, but leaves a lot to be desired
[12:16:29] <william__> I live in England unfortunately ... Looks amazing though, I would love to go to a big event. Problem with programming by myself is that I am really out the know :/
[12:17:27] <JKarsrud> oojacoboo: like what?
[12:17:42] <oojacoboo> JKarsrud: well, I can't figure out why mine isn't working :P
[12:17:45] <ajpiano> william__: ah  for shame!
[12:17:49] <oojacoboo> and I think I need to see more samples
[12:18:15] <JKarsrud> oojacoboo: paste, and I'm sure we can figure something out :)
[12:18:36] <JKarsrud> anyone in here going to Frontend 2011 in Norway next week? :)
[12:18:47] <oojacoboo> JKarsrud: http://jsfiddle.net/tqm3U/1/
[12:18:51] <Ramka> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/dNXnZ/
[12:19:40] <ajpiano> meh, terrible office DNS :/
[12:21:18] <oojacoboo> JKarsrud: http://jsfiddle.net/tqm3U/2/  typo
[12:21:37] <JKarsrud> oojacoboo: well, there seems to be some errors in there, but I don't know if you have them yourself, or if it's just because of jsfiddle
[12:21:50] <oojacoboo> JKarsrud: what errors?
[12:22:43] <JKarsrud> $.fn.cookie is not a function
[12:22:55] <Ramka> ajpiano: all works fine as long as i don't use an object's method
[12:23:07] <ajpiano> i haven't seen the code yet Ramka :/
[12:23:10] <oojacoboo> JKarsrud: it is, it's part of the plugin
[12:23:23] <JKarsrud> oojacoboo: oh, ok
[12:23:27] <oojacoboo> it works too
[12:23:37] <jedimind_> ajpiano, <3
[12:23:38] <oojacoboo> the .ajax() is the only thing that isn't working
[12:24:00] <jedimind_> ajpiano, just gotta tell you you're a life saver (yet again) with http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[12:24:04] <oojacoboo> jedimind: what's up brotha man
[12:24:07] <Ramka> ajpiano: k'
[12:24:08] <jedimind_> ive sent probably 15 people there in the last 2 days
[12:24:19] <jedimind_> oojacoboo, not much man, just getting comfortable at a new gig
[12:24:27] <oojacoboo> yea?  what gig is this?
[12:24:37] <ajpiano> Ramka: building sql strings on the client side is what we call "not a good idea"
[12:25:07] <Ramka> ajpiano: they are used by the web sql stored on the client
[12:25:08] <ajpiano> Ramka: i think you need to do some debugging to find out what 'this' is at the various times you're using it
[12:25:17] <ajpiano> oh ok that's a bit more reasonable :)
[12:25:21] <jedimind_> oojacoboo, just another agency / dev shop got brought on as part of the front end team, but looks like i'll be taking over all web development management
[12:25:27] <JKarsrud> oojacoboo: well, have you tried throwing an errorhandler in there too, to see if that catches something? "Not working" isn't very helpful :)
[12:25:33] <william__> ajpiano: 'building sql strings on the client side is what we call "not a good idea"' - lad point.
[12:26:04] <oojacoboo> JKarsrud: yep, thought about that about 10 min ago, that was part of my search for examples since I don't know the syntax
[12:27:17] <Ramka> ajpiano: what i'm trying to do is to tell the transaction.executeSql( ) to handover the results to an object property, and to trigger a method of the object, so that i can avoid putting setTimeouts all the time
[12:27:21] <JKarsrud> aha. I don't know if .done() or .fail() are implemented in 1.6.3 or if you can still use .success() and .error() on the ajax function, but I bet ajpiano knows ;)
[12:27:42] <ajpiano> you can still use success and error but it's better to do done and fail
[12:27:46] <oojacoboo> JKarsrud: if(data ==1)?
[12:27:50] <ajpiano> if you're using the late-binding thing
[12:28:22] <JKarsrud> oojacoboo: if that's what you expect your data to return
[12:28:35] <oojacoboo> JKarsrud: na
[12:28:38] <oojacoboo> so
[12:28:45] <oojacoboo> done() and fail() aren't in the API
[12:28:50] <ajpiano> Ramka: but 'this' might be changing in a way that you aren't expecting
[12:28:55] <oojacoboo> and I don't know enough about the syntax to take that into action
[12:28:59] <oojacoboo> so where can I read on that
[12:29:18] <ajpiano> oojacoboo: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[12:29:21] <jedimind_> there are so many times that i arbitrarily try a function name in jquery and it turns out it actually exists
[12:29:32] <Phrogz> context: I've finally found the bug. I'm creating a minimal testcase now. This is...deep. :)
[12:29:47] <JKarsrud> oojacoboo: or just read the api doc for .ajax()? it's all in there:  http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.ajax
[12:29:56] <oojacoboo> JKarsrud: I didn't see it there
[12:30:08] <oojacoboo> ummm this isn't the same API :/
[12:30:17] <oojacoboo> what's the diff http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:30:21] <JKarsrud> I mean the success and error handlers
[12:30:35] <JKarsrud> oojacoboo: nothing, I just like jqapi better :P
[12:30:54] <oojacoboo> meh, I like the comments
[12:30:58] <oojacoboo> like php api
[12:31:12] <zoned> using the .attr('attrname','value') method overwrites the specified attribute. is there an 'appendAttr' or equivalent?
[12:31:30] <Ramka> ajpiano, my problem is that the context is lost, and this becomes the DOMWindow instead of the object. using a closure with the buildCallbackFunction() doesn't work.
[12:31:55] <ajpiano> Ramka: you can use jQuery.proxy
[12:32:03] <ajpiano> to bind the scope of the function when it runs
[12:32:06] <ajpiano> ?proxy
[12:32:07] <bot-t> jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[12:32:52] <kborchers> zoned: wat? are you trying to add another attr with the same name? replace is the expected result then
[12:33:08] <zoned> i want to append to the attribute
[12:33:37] <zoned> i suppose i could just call this.attr('name', this.attr('name') + 'appendedVal'))
[12:33:47] <kborchers> yup
[12:33:53] <zoned> thought there might be a nicer way
[12:34:19] <Ramka> ajpiano, cool, will save me some headeaches. Is it failsafe (no memory leaks ?)
[12:34:35] <ajpiano> Ramka: yeah it's fine, i haven't seen any reports about it leaking memory
[12:34:44] <ajpiano> Ramka: the "pure" way to do this is to use Function.prototype.bind
[12:34:51] <ajpiano> but that doesn't exist everywhere
[12:34:53] <diverdude> ajpiano, hehe can i ask you one more question regarding autocomplete?
[12:35:00] <ajpiano> sorry you just used it
[12:35:00] <ajpiano> :p
[12:35:05] <diverdude> damn
[12:37:37] <Ramka> wondering if js would allow me to mess with the database object prototype :)
[12:37:42] <diverdude> ajpiano, ill try my luck anyway :D (dpls dont kill me hehe). I have been looking at the custom example. I want to add a checkbox, and i did like this: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/521472356  But the checkbox goes to the left side of the row nomatter what i do. How do i control this?
[12:38:08] <ajpiano> diverdude: CSS
[12:38:22] <diverdude> ajpiano, yes, but CSS on what?
[12:38:31] <level09> what are some alternative to .html() method ?
[12:38:45] <ajpiano> level09: alternative in what way?
[12:38:50] <level09> for some reason , can't get it to work on iOS  devices
[12:38:54] <ajpiano> lol
[12:39:00] <level09> ajpiano: i'm actually not sure what happens
[12:39:09] <Ramka> level09: .append() .prepend() document.getElementById.innerHTML( ...)
[12:39:11] <level09> trying to write a video tag
[12:39:14] <level09> inside a container
[12:39:29] <level09> Ramka: thanks, gonna try that old school :D
[12:40:12] <Ramka> level09: the html works fine, probably the selector is getting messed up ?
[12:40:23] <Jayflux> anyone know why i can't parse this into a json http://jsfiddle.net/yyKJZ/1/
[12:40:24] <level09> yeah maybe
[12:40:31] <bapi_> how can I by using bind check if the user clicks outside the div or presses enter?
[12:40:32] <level09> well, its hard to exactly identify
[12:40:40] <level09> there is not firebug for mobile safari
[12:40:59] <diverdude> ajpiano, ?
[12:41:01] <ajpiano> Jayflux: http://jsonlint.org
[12:41:09] <ajpiano> diverdude: the elements?
[12:41:18] <Jayflux> ahh thanks ajpiano
[12:41:21] <ajpiano> give the elements a class or whatever when you construct 'em
[12:41:22] <Jayflux> this will be useful
[12:41:24] <diverdude> ajpiano, yeah, but how do i do that?
[12:41:29] <ajpiano> ...
[12:41:32] <Ramka> level09: you can have a simili console by setting the developper option in settings
[12:41:41] <josh99> i see in one js file $(document).ready and in another one JQuery(document).ready. is it ok?
[12:41:46] <ajpiano> josh99: yes
[12:41:56] <diverdude> ajpiano, do they have a class or what? how does their default css look like etc?
[12:42:10] <level09> Ramka: yeah, saw that. does it record console.log stuff ?
[12:42:18] <ajpiano> level09: have you tried using weinre?
[12:42:21] <josh99> ajpiano: so each one being called when it's ready?
[12:42:25] <ajpiano> it's awesome for debugging ios/android stuff
[12:42:27] <level09> ajpiano: never heard of it
[12:42:30] * level09 checking
[12:42:34] <ajpiano> ?g weinre
[12:42:35] <bot-t> ajpiano, weinre - Home - http://phonegap.github.com/weinre/
[12:42:47] <ajpiano> josh99: yep
[12:42:55] <ajpiano> both being called when the dom is ready, actually
[12:43:09] <jedimind_> "fork a weiner on github!"
[12:43:14] <josh99> ajpiano: both at the same time?
[12:43:19] <level09> thanks guys, gonna have a look at that
[12:43:22] <ajpiano> no, one after the other
[12:43:45] <Ramka> level09: objects are converted toString()
[12:44:10] <Jayflux> thanks again for that link ajpiano useful, sorted my problemish
[12:44:12] <josh99> ajpiano: in the order of including them, right?
[12:44:17] <ajpiano> yep
[12:44:23] <josh99> ok. thanks
[12:46:05] <cmaea> I am trying to submit to a page, using $.post('url',{data},function() {});
[12:46:30] <cmaea> however, the url keeps showing up red in firefox and the success function never gets called
[12:46:32] <cmaea> any ideas?
[12:46:51] <ajpiano> sounds like it's 404'ng or otherwise erroring
[12:46:51] <oojacoboo> ah, deferreds are awesome
[12:46:55] <ajpiano> oojacoboo: yep
[12:46:57] <oojacoboo> does that only work with .ajax() ?
[12:47:08] <ajpiano> no you can construct deferreds and use them arbitrarily
[12:47:26] <cmaea> If I type in the full path i can see that it is not a 404
[12:47:30] <oojacoboo> but they aren't built into any other functions, right?
[12:47:37] <ajpiano> oojacoboo: http://lanyrd.com/2011/jquery-sf-bay-area/sdptk/
[12:47:54] <ajpiano> oojacoboo: animations also make a promise() accessible as well
[12:47:59] <josh99> when i have a function, is the body of it being interpretd only when it's being called?
[12:48:12] <oojacoboo> very nice ajpiano thanks
[12:48:20] <juha_> bot-t: tell coldhead he's awesome
[12:48:20] <bot-t> juha_, Okay.
[12:48:23] <Jayflux> ajpiano the json inside is valid according to lint but jquery still gives me errors here http://jsfiddle.net/yyKJZ/2/
[12:49:44] <ajpiano> it's not really jquery that's even breaking, it's breaking the native json parser as well
[12:49:54] <Jayflux> hmm
[12:50:32] <Jayflux> jsonlint validates it though
[12:50:37] <ajpiano> yeah that is weird
[12:51:03] <ajpiano> i'm confused why there's like \r and \n inside of the content of your html object tags there
[12:51:09] <SnackWhack> after a page loads, I'm replacing the html inside of a form with my own html. In that new html I have some radio buttons. How can I bind the new buttons to HTML? Do I do the bind right after I out put the new html? $('form[action*="/pls/test/bwskalog.P_DispNewApp"]').html(myHTML)
[12:51:15] <Jayflux> its content pulled from a db ajpiano
[12:51:28] <ajpiano> you're storing tags in the database as strings
[12:51:30] <ajpiano> ?
[12:51:41] <SnackWhack> How can I bind the new buttons to click events?*
[12:52:20] <Jayflux> ajpiano its just how its being saved into there
[12:52:29] <cmaea> does the backend script that I am calling need special stuff? or can it just simply be "hi"
[12:52:36] <cmaea> or does it need all the proper <html> etc
[12:52:51] <ajpiano> Jayflux: well it's pretty buggered dontcha think
[12:52:59] <ajpiano> cmaea: it can just be "hi"
[12:53:02] <Jayflux> lol yeah ajpiano any ideas?
[12:53:05] <ajpiano> assuming you're requseting plaintext not json
[12:53:08] <ajpiano> nope
[12:53:18] <ajpiano> i amn't the one saving stringifed tags into the DB, your app is
[12:54:06] <cmaea> well maybe there is something wrong with my mod_security rules
[12:54:06] <JKarsrud> amn't? hah!
[12:54:10] <cmaea> that is the last thing I can think of
[12:54:27] <Dave_Stein> hey ajpiano: isnt it bad practice to use .load/post/get instead of ajax since user has less control of success/error callbacks?
[12:54:28] <bapi_> how can I detect the enter key being pressed?
[12:54:38] <cmaea> <bapi_: bind
[12:54:38] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: no
[12:54:44] <Dave_Stein> event.keyCode === $.ui.keyCode.RETURN
[12:54:51] <Dave_Stein> bapi_: ^
[12:54:57] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: sometimes you just don't need that level of control
[12:55:04] <ajpiano> eventually once you get used to it it's weird to use the shortcuts
[12:55:27] <ajpiano> but like, it's not bad practise to use a bicycle before you become a motocross star
[12:55:31] <ajpiano> it's just ... what happens.
[12:55:34] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: yeah we are trending away from all the shortcuts cause we made a wrapper for form handling that will automatically do stuff with error callback of $.ajax
[12:55:50] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i disagree with your analogy but agree with your point haha
[12:55:51] <ajpiano> yeah - most people end up with a wrapper in their apps that normalises all requests
[12:56:01] <ajpiano> most people == me
[12:56:02] <ajpiano> :D
[12:56:15] <Dave_Stein> and Behance haha
[12:56:20] <Dave_Stein> and im sure other companies too
[12:56:30] <ajpiano> heh yeah, i don't think i was the first to come up with that
[12:56:38] <Ramka> $.proxy() very usefull, fixed my pb. thank ajpiano (btw i had a flaw, i did mix up functions ... i've probably been playing too much with the code, then stared at it dumbly...)
[12:56:47] <ajpiano> sweet Ramka
[12:57:03] <Dave_Stein> <3 proxy
[12:58:28] <Gangans> hi

[12:59:20] <Gangans> can someone say any plugin for multiple file uploading?
[12:59:43] <SnackWhack> $('form[action*="/pls/test/bwskalog.P_DispNewApp"]'). <- when I move this to production, 'test' will go away in that string. How would I select that, but only if it contains 'bwskalog.P_DispNewApp'?
[12:59:45] <ajpiano> ?g plupload @ Gangans

[13:01:28] <ajpiano> jaubourg: Ramka
[13:01:31] <ajpiano> Ramka: jaubourg :)
[13:01:38] <jaubourg> Ramka: hi :)

[13:02:01] <jaubourg> Ramka: looking for some training europe-side?
[13:02:02] <ajpiano> Ramka: jaubourg is a member of the jquery team, rewrote $.ajax, etc :)
[13:02:23] <Ramka> jaubourf, ajpiano : great !
[13:02:43] <Ramka> how could we get in touch ?
[13:02:56] <jaubourg> do you speak french by any chance?
[13:03:02] <Ramka> yups
[13:03:37] <jaubourg> ok, so best thing to do is to drop a mail at florent@creative-area.net
[13:03:51] <jaubourg> he's the guy at my company that deals with prices and stuff ;)
[13:04:04] <jaubourg> I'll drop him a mail and tell him you'll contact hime
[13:04:08] <jaubourg> without the e ;)
[13:04:23] <jaubourg> We're based in Paris
[13:04:37] <jaubourg> I personally live in Brussels but it's not far ;
[13:04:39] <jaubourg> )
[13:04:47] <oojacoboo> ajpiano: so screw success: within $.ajax() ?
[13:05:00] <oojacoboo> and instead use.. $.ajax().done() :)
[13:05:14] <Ramka> jaubourg: that will be great. we have good wine here, you have good beer there, both would do ;)
[13:05:15] <ajpiano> oojacoboo: not necessarily
[13:05:23] <oojacoboo> no?
[13:06:07] <jaubourg> Ramka :)
[13:06:16] <ajpiano> i mean, it's a matter of preference, i think you can do whatever you ilke
[13:06:37] <jaubourg> oojacoboo: jqXHR.success === jqXHR.done
[13:06:48] <jaubourg> like... literally
[13:07:00] <ajpiano> jaubourg: he's asking if it's preferable to keep using the success: option to $.ajax({}) or do late-bind
[13:07:03] <oojacoboo> danheberden: was saying that it's better to use .done() so you aren't mix-matching the derreds with your standard execution
[13:07:06] <ajpiano> i think it's immaterial
[13:07:17] <danzik171> oojacoboo: personally i would - i find it nicer to just work with the Deferred style api than ye olde ajax methods, especially if i'm doing some caching in a plain object or something
[13:08:12] <cdera> it looks like $.post() does not send proper Content-Length header; how can we fix this?
[13:08:12] <danheberden> better is relative - that's just my opinion
[13:08:27] <jaubourg> danheberden: it IS better
[13:08:28] <danheberden> but i think it's a good one ;)
[13:08:35] <danheberden> jaubourg NOU
[13:09:19] <oojacoboo> yea, I think so to, easier to just follow that standard than mix/match
[13:09:24] <oojacoboo> too*
[13:10:48] <Whirl3d> I can't decide if I am doing something else wrong, but does $(".textarea").val() work to get the value of the textarea field?
[13:11:08] <ajpiano> yes
[13:11:12] <kborchers> Whirl3d: only if the textarea has a class and there is only one
[13:11:31] <ravenzz> Whirl3d maybe you want to select the $('textarea')
[13:11:45] <Ramka> jaubourg: how do you work, you do custom fit trainings, or have plans ? would you have a website ?
[13:11:45] <Whirl3d> kborchers, thanks. I was asking in general, but your point is well taken. Ajpiano, thanks, ravenzzz, thanks as well
[13:11:48] <bapi_> can I make .bind apply to another div?
[13:11:59] <bapi_> bind.(click in another div.. )
[13:12:15] <ravenzz> yw
[13:12:33] <ngharo> bapi_: you mean bind to two elements?
[13:13:19] <bapi_> I basically want to check if the user clicks outside my div, but im having problems since the div under my main div gets triggered while i click on the div that is ontop of that aswell >.<

[13:13:42] <dabear> ah
[13:13:44] <dabear> hm
[13:14:50] <ngharo> bapi_: kinda sounds like you need to stop the event from bubbling up.  see ?stopPropagation
[13:14:51] <bot-t> bapi_, event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[13:15:04] <Ramka> jaubourg: i've beeped florent. cheers.
[13:15:22] <rgr> I guess this might be a bot obvious but I'm not finding it, how to I run arbitrary code with out making a named function first. e.g something like $("selector").exec(a();b(););
[13:15:46] <danheberden> rgr wat
[13:16:18] <danheberden> $( 'selector').each( function() { $(this).css( 'color', '#FF0000' ); });
[13:16:27] <rgr> thanks
[13:16:38] <kborchers> danheberden === mind reader
[13:16:46] <danheberden> kborchers i do all magic
[13:16:49] <kborchers> hah!
[13:16:51] <rgr> why a mind reader? description is clear enuff..
[13:16:53] <JKarsrud> whoa, I did not read that out of that :P
[13:18:28] <xp_prg> I want to create a mockup screen using jqueryui components, is there a graphical designer tool like qtdesigner to achieve that goal?
[13:21:50] <rgr> Whats the neatest way in jquery to get the href of the first link in the children of element e? Id prefer not to add a tag to the link elements if I cane help it (I could then just find that class and guess use attr to get the href).
[13:22:10] <jcrawford> hello guys.  I had some code that I bound to the ajaxStart and ajaxStop and it worked fine but I only want to block the screen on ajax calls that are external is there a way I can differenciate between external and internal ajax calls in the bind?
[13:22:45] <kborchers> rgr: $(e).children("a").first().attr("href")
[13:22:54] <Ibuprofen> anyone had experience with UI autocomplete? I am having trouble keeping track of wether or not the search method is making matches or not.
[13:23:01] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano kborchers: do you know if I do $('.elements').delegate('td') - is there a way for the callback to know which "element" it came from?
[13:23:23] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: event.target
[13:23:25] <kborchers> event.target
[13:23:50] <jcrawford> anyone know?
[13:24:13] <Dave_Stein> ahhh
[13:24:16] <Dave_Stein> i thought event.target would be the td
[13:24:19] <Dave_Stein> thanks
[13:24:37] <rgr> oh right. nice.
[13:24:48] <Dave_Stein> oh wait crap maybe you guys misunderstood me, my coworker is saying that its the td
[13:24:52] <jcrawford> this is my code that is run on the ajax events: http://jsfiddle.net/aNuQH/ but what I would like to do is ONLY have that code run on ajax events that make EXTERNAL calls, internal calls are fast and no point in blocking the UI
[13:25:03] <kborchers> oh i see what your saying Dave_Stein
[13:25:05] <Dave_Stein> $('.poop').delegate('td') how do i know which poop i came from, NOT the TD :)
[13:25:10] <kborchers> which .element
[13:25:17] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[13:25:34] <Dave_Stein> i feel liek i should be telling my coworker to not use a class as the base for delegate
[13:25:47] <JohnnyDavidson> How would I get mouse coordinates in relation to the element the event is on?
[13:26:10] <Dave_Stein> JohnnyDavidson a combination of $('#el').offset() against the event.X and Y
[13:26:13] <Dave_Stein> i think?
[13:26:22] <JohnnyDavidson> Like if I had $(someimage).mousemove(function(e){});
[13:26:36] <JohnnyDavidson> How would I get the coordinates of the mouse in relation to someimage
[13:26:48] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano kborchers: event.originalEvent.currentTarget - although i feel like theres a better way to get to that
[13:26:48] <ajpiano> jcrawford: you could try using a prefilter, that will give you access to the options of the ajax call and you can check if the url starts with http://
[13:27:01] <snover> Dave_Stein: event.target refers to the lowest clicked element, not necessarily the one that was delegated to
[13:27:02] <jcrawford> ajpiano: could you direct me to something to read about that?
[13:27:17] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: i think that's the best you're going to get
[13:27:17] <ajpiano> jcrawford: http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[13:27:29] <snover> this and event.currentTarget both refer to the element that was in the inner selector
[13:27:31] <jcrawford> thanks
[13:27:35] <Dave_Stein> JohnnyDavidson: i believe youd do $(this).offset() in the callback and compare those numbers with e.X
[13:27:48] <Dave_Stein> snover: my coworker says if he uses originalEvent.target its fine
[13:27:50] <zoned> i have an img with class=infoicon inside a div. $('#div').remove('.infoicon'); doesn't seem to be removing it?
[13:28:21] <kborchers> zoned: is the div's id div?
[13:28:39] <zoned> kborchers, no
[13:28:47] <kborchers> or did you mean $('div').remove('.infoicon');
[13:29:01] <Dave_Stein> JohnnyDavidson: by e.X I meant e.clientX and e.clientY
[13:29:02] <zoned> i have an img with class=infoicon inside a div. $('#myDivsID').remove('.infoicon'); doesn't seem to be removing it?

[13:30:55] <zoned> ahhh
[13:31:00] <zoned> thx :)
[13:31:14] <ajpiano> drupin: jQuery is a JavaScript library, it does not have "website templates"
[13:31:29] <snover> there *is* a property that contains the information you are looking for but it is not documented and I am not going to give you the rope to hang yourself with :)
[13:32:08] <drupin> i know.. but i want to use it on my website ajpiano
[13:32:09] <Phrogz> ajpiano: I need your expertise. Can you please look at http://phrogz.net/tmp/chrome-jQuery-visible-slowdown.html ?
[13:32:24] <ajpiano> drupin: go ahead, no one's stopping you :)
[13:32:37] <Phrogz> I get a 40x-500x slowdown in Chrome depending on whether I create an array before or inside the function. WTF?
[13:33:06] <drupin> ajpiano: i dont know how??
[13:33:16] <Phrogz> context: You too. And garf. This is baffling.
[13:33:21] <bapi_> Or better, can I check that a particular element in my div isn't clicked while I have a .click handler attached to it?
[13:33:25] <ajpiano> drupin: include it, and then attempt to do your task
[13:33:26] <jcrawford> ajpiano: much appreciated that worked perfect for me to check options.url.indexOf('http')
[13:33:45] <ajpiano> drupin: there are many tutorials out there on the net for getting started with jquery

[13:35:53] <jcrawford> ajpiano: but i just realized all my calls are internal lol it's the PHP that is making the external call taking so damn long.  Will have to figure out another way to do this gah
[13:38:16] <jcrawford> got it i just passed another option in the ajax call named blockUI: true
[13:41:20] <oojacoboo> hey ajpiano, does that ajax call and deferreds look good to you?  http://jsfiddle.net/tqm3U/3/
[13:41:55] <oojacoboo> I'm a bit on the learning side here with js :/
[13:42:00] <Phrogz> I'd welcome any suggestions on how to pare down this problem any further. (FWIW, I've determined that it also occurs in Safari, so it's a Webkit bug, not just Chrome.)
[13:42:22] <ajpiano> oojacoboo: it's "function" not "fucntion"
[13:42:26] <oojacoboo> ha
[13:42:31] <oojacoboo> besides that :P
[13:42:38] <ajpiano> Phrogz: yeah if you profile it it's like, 99.8% [native code]
[13:43:23] <ajpiano> but if you do it with the checkbox on, it's 99.9% [native code]
[13:43:45] <context> nm. this said 1.yard == 3.feet #=> false. not gonna touch it anyway
[13:44:00] <ajpiano> Phrogz: calculating the visibilty of every element in that classes jquery object seems to happening more times than it actually happens
[13:44:10] <ajpiano> i mean, more times than necessary
[13:45:08] <ajpiano> Phrogz: when you do showMethodsForClasses and it gets called a bunch of times when you do Find All... you're calculating visibility for all entire collection of classes on every call.... seeme excessive
[13:45:14] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Interesting. So...jQuery bug? Or Webkit? Or both? Doesn't happen in Firefox.
[13:45:35] <ajpiano> i'm pretty sure it's not a jQuery bug
[13:45:49] <ajpiano> i'd be curiuos to see if perf was improved
[13:45:53] <ajpiano> if you used something else besdies :visible
[13:46:02] <ajpiano> but instead set a flag on the elem/in data
[13:46:58] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Good question. The weird part, if you'll notice the output, is that the array returns the same number of items, and the performance of the JavaScript side is virtually unchanged.
[13:47:12] <Phrogz> All the time takes place after the function is done, before the browser updates.
[13:47:25] <ajpiano> Phrogz: but all the time is spent in the browser, not jquery
[13:47:30] <ajpiano> Phrogz: usin console.profile()
[13:47:58] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Baffling. Can you see a flaw with my timing methodology there?
[13:48:20] <Phrogz> I suppose it could be occurring during some GC phase as the function finishes...
[13:48:38] <Phrogz> Oh wait, no, we're saying the same thing.
[13:49:10] <ajpiano> yeah im not sure what is going on at all
[13:49:59] <Phrogz> Thank you. That makes me feel a hair less dumb :)
[13:50:23] <Cameron> anyone??
[13:50:53] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Yes, adding a .shown class to those that are shown and using that in the filter instead of :visible fixes it.
[13:51:04] * Phrogz goes to expand the test case for clarity.
[13:51:10] <Cameron> <Cameron> why wont this canvas work?
[13:51:10] <Cameron> <Cameron> http://vermilionsite.com/Blankk/canvas.html
[13:51:10] <Cameron> <Cameron> there are no errors it just doesnt work
[13:52:16] <Ahrengot> Is there a plugin working like jQuery backstretch, but stretches the background image proportinally 100% inside the container rather than scaling beyond the container to fill the background.
[13:52:20] <Phrogz> Cameron: There are errors when you click.
[13:52:36] <Cameron> oh yeah
[13:52:53] <bapi_> how can I pass on variables to the from the parent to the .bind?
[13:53:07] <Hooloovoo> bapi_: eh?
[13:53:15] <Hooloovoo> you mean like have the vars in the same scope?
[13:53:22] <Cameron> ahah it works!! thanks!!!
[13:54:29] <bapi_> $('#div').mousedown(function() { var test = "hello"; }).bind('mouseup', function() {     reach var test here } });
[13:54:57] <Hooloovoo> bapi_: you should read up on some basic javascript
[13:55:26] <Hooloovoo> bapi_: but what you wanna do is declare it outsice the first event. that way it will be accessible inside both those functions.
[13:55:32] <Hooloovoo> outside*
[13:56:43] <Hooloovoo> bapi_: http://pastebin.com/SkVf0RLW
[14:02:18] <oojacoboo> can someone look at this ajax() request, I am lost or at least give me some pointers on how I can better debug it... http://jsfiddle.net/tqm3U/6/
[14:02:43] <bapi_> Is it possible to add a keypress event to a bind event with mouseup? .bind('mouseup') I want to add a trigger on a certain keypress aswell
[14:03:23] <jedimind_> oh boy jacob
[14:03:35] <jedimind_> are you sure its a good idea to have all that html hardcoded in your js?
[14:03:50] <oojacoboo> jedimind: hell no, it's not a choice grrr
[14:03:54] <jedimind_> and also, .template() is your friend
[14:04:02] <oojacoboo> jedimind: not an option
[14:04:08] <oojacoboo> this is for zendesk integration
[14:04:28] <jedimind_> so? you dont have to use templates in HTML, you can define them in your javascript, only abstract them
[14:04:39] <jedimind_> zendesk = headdesk
[14:04:45] <jedimind_> but i digress
[14:04:55] <oojacoboo> yea didn't know about template()
[14:04:58] <oojacoboo> that sounds cool
[14:05:01] <jedimind_> and dont have time to actually debug your ajax call, but am a big enough dick to point out failures
[14:05:11] <jedimind_> :)
[14:05:15] <jedimind_> YOURE WELCOME
[14:05:23] <oojacoboo> yea...
[14:05:44] <jedimind_> general protips for debugging js: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[14:05:51] <jedimind_> or jq anyway
[14:06:30] <jedimind_> ajpiano, :(
[14:06:34] <ajpiano> wat
[14:06:47] <jedimind_> i cant read http://fixingthesejquery.com on my laptop
[14:06:53] <jedimind_> cuz you disabled vertical scroll
[14:06:54] <jedimind_> silly
[14:06:58] <ajpiano> better than not being able to read
[14:07:06] <jedimind_> that is true
[14:07:08] <ajpiano> i didn't do anything, every single google slides does that
[14:07:09] * jedimind_ shields his eyes
[14:07:15] <ajpiano> jedimind_: ctrl minus
[14:07:17] <jedimind_> just because they're dumb, doesnt mean you have to be
[14:07:19] <ajpiano> cmd
[14:07:22] <Phrogz> ajpiano: 1) It's fine if you use .filter('.visible') instead of .filter(':visible');  2) It's fine if you do    classes.filter(':visible') ... methods.hide();   but bad if you do    methods.hide(); classes.filter(':visible')
[14:08:13] <Phrogz> (That's why it 'works' when called from outside the function...it's the order of those two statements that makes the difference.
[14:12:05] <elpancho> interweb died
[14:12:07] <bapi_> How can I get the value of <input type="text" class="box" value="test"> ?
[14:12:07] <elpancho> as i was saying ...
[14:12:13] <elpancho> ajpiano, you know me, im not happy unless i can complain about something :(
[14:13:22] <oojacoboo> if you have function blah() { return 'whatever';}
[14:13:34] <elpancho> $('input.box').val(); but that is easily googleable
[14:13:40] <oojacoboo> and you are trying to call that return in another function, how would you do that?
[14:13:57] <kborchers> bapi_: if there is only one input with class box $("input.box").val(); otherwise, we need a little more context
[14:14:02] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Updated test: http://phrogz.net/tmp/webkit-jquery-browser-update-slowdown.html   definitely feels like a jQuery bug since the order of of those two jQuery calls has the effect.
[14:14:08] <image_q> hello, I am having issues with the slideDown jquery method, for some reason it works the first time, but after I use slideUp, it stops working. The div still appears but it doesn't slide down, I am using jquery 1.4.2. Please note that it works perfectly in the new 1.6.4 version
[14:14:14] <image_q> any ideas about this bug?
[14:15:22] <BarelyFitz> oojacoboo: what do you mean "call that return in another function"?
[14:15:25] <ajpiano> Phrogz: the effect that jQuery has might be cuasing the slowdown, i don't know if it's jquery's fault
[14:15:33] <ajpiano> image_q: so upgrade
[14:15:41] <ajpiano> jquery 1.4.2 is old
[14:15:43] <image_q> yeah I wish I could
[14:15:46] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Right...but perhaps something that jQuery should work around. I'll be filing in both jQuery and Webkit.
[14:15:46] <image_q> my boss is an idiot
[14:15:48] <ajpiano> what is stopping you
[14:15:58] <image_q> they made crappy code that breaks down in the new version
[14:16:00] <indiefan2a> Hey. I have an li and a parent element and i need to count how many ul's are between the two. is there a way to do this with jquery?
[14:16:02] <ajpiano> Phrogz: file in webkit first and link that pls on jquery
[14:16:07] <oojacoboo> BarelyFitz: well, I have a .then(fucntion()
[14:16:09] <ajpiano> image_q: that's pretty vague
[14:16:31] <oojacoboo> with a .replaceWith() which I want to be what it returned from that other function
[14:16:32] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Will do.
[14:16:37] <oojacoboo> which*
[14:16:46] <indiefan2a> meaning i'm within a sublist, and i need to know how many tiers down i am
[14:16:48] <image_q> is this a popular bug though?
[14:17:02] <image_q> like the slideDown just stops sliding
[14:17:23] <ajpiano> i don't believe so
[14:18:32] <BarelyFitz> oojacoboo: can you paste/fiddle a snippet of your code to give a better idea?
[14:18:42] <WalkWurst> how do I add my own function to an element?  Example, I want to add a .reset() to a #div.dialog()
[14:18:45] <oojacoboo> BarelyFitz: http://jsfiddle.net/tqm3U/8/
[14:19:02] <oojacoboo> toiwards the bottom there after the ajax() request
[14:24:18] <BarelyFitz> oojacoboo: I'm not too familiar with deferred. but I would think that the data that was returned from your .get() call would be passed as an argument to your .then function?
[14:25:06] <oojacoboo> BarelyFitz: I honestly don't know enough about how to pass arguments from function to function to write that properly
[14:25:27] <oojacoboo> like function (whatever) {}
[14:25:36] <oojacoboo> whatever is what's passed to that fucntion and used within it, correct?
[14:25:38] <oojacoboo> like php?
[14:25:48] <BarelyFitz> oojacoboo: yeah, try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/tqm3U/9/
[14:25:57] <oojacoboo> and does it have to be passed to the parent for a child function to use
[14:26:24] <oojacoboo> BarelyFitz: I see
[14:26:32] <oojacoboo> is "data" a reserved var?
[14:26:42] <digitalice> hi
[14:26:46] <digitalice> got a question
[14:26:57] <BarelyFitz> oojacoboo: no, it's just the first param to the function. you could call it "stuff" if you wanted.
[14:27:11] <digitalice> ive got a jquery plugin, and i need to re run it when i add some content in the page
[14:27:14] <digitalice> how can i do that? :P
[14:27:18] <BarelyFitz> ? get @oojacoboo
[14:27:19] <bot-t> oojacoboo, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[14:27:25] <BarelyFitz> that's not it
[14:27:34] <BarelyFitz> ? jquery.get @oojacoboo
[14:27:34] <bot-t> oojacoboo, jQuery.get(url, [data], [callback], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[14:27:36] <oojacoboo> yea, I'm reading the api as well
[14:27:42] <oojacoboo> hasn't helped a lot here
[14:28:07] <oojacoboo> I just don't see the primary function with the $.get() specifying "data" anywhere
[14:28:15] <oojacoboo> so, it's like data was pulled out of thin air
[14:28:17] <BarelyFitz> so in the callback function for a .get, it receives three parameters (data,textstatus,jqxhr)
[14:28:34] <BarelyFitz> you're only interested in the data, so you can just use the first parameter
[14:28:40] <oojacoboo> ah
[14:28:56] <oojacoboo> so it always passes an array like that?
[14:29:10] <Phrogz> ajpiano: FYI: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10432
[14:29:20] <BarelyFitz> it always passes three args to the callback function
[14:29:29] <oojacoboo> I see
[14:30:02] <ajpiano> Phrogz: i have a feeling that my colleagues on the bugs team will want a slightly more pared down testcase :p
[14:30:16] <oojacoboo> this is the most frustrating thing I think I've ever had to deal with
[14:30:29] <oojacoboo> I can't get this ajax call to work for the life of me :/
[14:31:46] <digitalice> hi, how can i reload/re run jquery plugin?
[14:32:09] <Phrogz> ajpiano: I know...it kills me. Removing the timing would simplify the code, but make it harder to see the bug. Making less HTML will also mask the problem. I've spent 5 hours paring this down already, and at this point I need to move on.
[14:32:16] <ajpiano> ok
[14:32:24] <ajpiano> well i'm sure you'll hear back from either webkit or jquery or both :)
[14:32:38] <Phrogz> That's better than the alternative, anyhow ;)
[14:34:05] <rhizmoe> can i get a style check? I'm a noob and trying to figure out if i'm on the right idiomatic tracks: http://jsfiddle.net/t8Lc8/4/
[14:34:39] <s34n> how can I access the xml source of a document that has an xslt stylesheet?
[14:34:41] <Phrogz> ajpiano: Thanks again for your support with that.
[14:34:58] <ajpiano> welcome Phrogz, wish i knew what was goin on better
[14:35:04] <s34n> it gets transformed by the browser before jquery even kicks in
[14:35:41] <rhizmoe> s34n: should you need to?
[14:36:01] <s34n> I need to
[14:40:15] <yedimind> ajpiano, do you still have a link to those standalone zips that microsoft forced everyone to take down ?
[14:40:22] <yedimind> ... standalone IE zips
[14:40:25] <ajpiano> the standalone ies
[14:40:25] <yedimind> forgot the key word there
[14:40:25] <ajpiano> ?
[14:40:29] <ajpiano> hm
[14:40:29] <yedimind> yeah
[14:41:01] <ajpiano> yup
[14:42:58] <yedimind> do you have a link handy or are you upping them or something?
[14:43:23] <yedimind> also, unrelated question, if i have an ajax call im making and need to set a session based on that, how can i pass that session back into the parent? if that makes sense
[14:43:37] <ajpiano> yedimind: oh whoops, i pmed your other nick
[14:43:42] <yedimind> ah
[14:43:59] <yedimind> that one's 30km away, mind re-pming :)
[14:44:04] <ajpiano> yedimind: typically people do that by storing a session token and sending it with all reqs
[14:44:22] <yedimind> what if i dont have the session token until i make the ajax request
[14:46:22] <trufa> I have an input type text in html
[14:46:30] <trufa> then in a button handler
[14:46:57] <trufa> I go
[14:47:00] <trufa> questionContent = $('#newQuestion'),
[14:47:38] <trufa> and it takes it as an htmlinputelement
[14:47:44] <trufa> how do I get the text there
[14:51:45] <Typh> .val()
[14:53:02] <trufa> questionContent = $('#newQuestion'),val()
[14:53:08] <trufa> questionContent = $('#newQuestion'),val()
[14:53:13] <trufa> questionContent = $('#newQuestion').val()
[14:53:25] <yedimind> ruh roh
[14:53:40] <yedimind> ahaha
[14:54:16] <bryricker> Hey guys, can anybody see why I'm getting the JS error here using autocomplete? http://jsfiddle.net/CWW9F/1/
[14:54:44] <bryricker> (type something in then check the JS error log)
[15:00:30] <bryricker> nevermind, I see I have to supply it an object, just like the error says :-p
[15:00:41] <Typh> bryricker: http://jsfiddle.net/CWW9F/2/
[15:00:42] <mastermaw> hi all
[15:00:50] <mastermaw> i'm using jquery and the form plugin
[15:01:26] <mastermaw> i want my processing php script to return html, as well as other variables
[15:01:46] <mastermaw> was going to use JSON to return html but i'm getting a parse error
[15:01:48] <bryricker> Typh: thanks. Jquery has very unclear documentation.
[15:02:04] <mastermaw> what's the best way to return some html? json? xml?
[15:02:21] <mastermaw> when i say return html, i mean a string containing html code
[15:02:45] <yedimind> return it as ... html
[15:02:48] <yedimind> i dont understand the question
[15:02:54] <yedimind> json != html, xml != html, html == html
[15:03:08] <mastermaw> ok
[15:04:08] <mastermaw> i post to a form, i want my form to return a status number, a success boolean and a message
[15:04:24] <Typh> bryricker: I agree
[15:04:24] <mastermaw> and the message is ideally html
[15:04:35] <yedimind> so that sounds to me like you need a json object of sorts
[15:04:44] <BinaryKitten> well you're not returning 1 piece of data mastermaw
[15:04:45] <bot-t> (22 hours 20 mins ago) <aaronmcadam> tell BinaryKitten: think your site is down?
[15:04:58] <yedimind> { "status" : 1, "success" : true, "message" : "<p>This is your message content</p>" }
[15:05:33] <yedimind> then when you get the data back, you can drop the message into your dom like ... $(data.message).appendTo('#messagearea');
[15:05:34] <yedimind> or something
[15:05:58] <mastermaw> that's what i'm doing
[15:06:05] <yedimind> so whats the problem? :)
[15:06:27] <mastermaw> except i'm using php function json_encode
[15:07:00] <mastermaw> eg: 			$jsonArray["message"] = "error";
[15:07:00] <mastermaw> 			$jsonArray["div"] = "signUserUp";
[15:07:00] <mastermaw> 			$jsonArray["html"] = "<div class=\"error\">Blah blah</div>";
[15:07:01] <mastermaw> echo json_encode($jsonArray);
[15:07:37] <yedimind> not a good idea to be pasting code in here
[15:07:42] <mastermaw> yes sorry
[15:08:34] <mastermaw> anyway that causes a parse error within jquery
[15:08:41] <yedimind> so dont use json_encode for the response?
[15:08:42] <yedimind> :)
[15:09:28] <mastermaw> just a normal echo?
[15:09:30] <yedimind> also it should really be "<div class='error'> ... </div>"
[15:10:58] <mastermaw> hmm
[15:11:04] <mastermaw> wonder if that is throwing it
[15:24:28] <zoned> is there a way to center an image inside a div without having the text in that div also centered? and without putting the image inside its own (nested) div?
[15:25:35] <skamikaze> zoned: try margin: 0 auto; and position: relative;
[15:26:22] <zoned> skamikaze, apply that style to the img?
[15:26:34] <skamikaze> yes dude
[15:26:34] <zoned> or it's parent div
[15:26:45] <skamikaze> nope to the img itself
[15:26:49] <zoned> skamikaze, didn't work :/
[15:27:02] <skamikaze> zoned: online example? ;)
[15:28:37] <zoned> ... <html><div id=test style="width:400px;"><img src=test.jpg style="margin:0 auto; position:relative;"/>lipsum</div></html>
[15:28:38] <zoned> in a notepad
[15:28:39] <zoned> lol
[15:31:05] <zoned> skamikaze, if i add "display:block" to that, then it works. but not for IE..
[15:32:04] <skamikaze> <!--[if lt IE 9]><center><![endif]--> ;)
[15:32:11] <skamikaze> just kidding
[15:32:23] <skamikaze> (but could work in that crappy browser)
[15:32:48] <fridgerator> Hi, does anyone have experience with CLEditor (wysiwyg editor)?  I'm trying to load html content (a very small html file with only <p> and <br> tags) into CLEditor, edit the content, and then save what was edited back into the html file.
[15:33:10] <zoned> haha
[15:33:32] <zoned> there's about 60 branches of 'quirks' modes, i bet it would work in one of them!
[15:35:08] <skamikaze> sry not in the mood for an ie fiddle atm ;) (and too lazy to load the vm)
[15:35:16] <skamikaze> what ie you tested?
[15:38:28] <fridgerator> is there a jquery wysiwyg plugin that allows you to load html content, edit, then save the edited content?
[15:40:10] <mastermaw> yedimind
[15:40:17] <mastermaw> $arr = array('message' => 'error', 'div' => 'signUserUp', 'html' => '<strong>error</strong>');
[15:40:18] <mastermaw> echo json_encode($arr);
[15:40:20] <mastermaw> that fails
[15:40:21] <skamikaze> fridgerator: wymeditor
[15:40:53] <mastermaw> but replace 'html' => '<strong>error</strong>' with 'html' => 'error' and it works
[15:40:59] <mastermaw> obviously doesn't like html
[15:41:05] <mastermaw> any idea why?
[15:41:11] <fridgerator> skamikaze thanks i'll check it out
[15:41:58] <mastermaw> anyone know why html seems to throw php's json_encode function?
[15:42:31] <BinaryKitten> mastermaw throw?
[15:43:26] <mastermaw> sorry, it jquery gives a parse error
[15:44:17] <BinaryKitten> there is a couple of plugins for the browsers
[15:44:21] <BinaryKitten> json view
[15:44:38] <BinaryKitten> install that and then call the php location directly
[15:44:41] <BinaryKitten> see what you get
[15:45:03] <skamikaze> mastermaw: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php#example-3214

[15:47:51] <Phrogz> nathanw_: Don't ask to ask, just ask :)
[15:47:55] <nathanw_> gry: http://jsfiddle.net/kpzfx/  - the function i'm trying to make is toggleSelect
[15:48:22] <Phrogz> (IRC is not a cocktail party. Do not introduce yourself to the hostess. Do not politely knock on the door. Barge in and pose your question, and watch the room grow silent and answer you.)
[15:48:37] <nathanw_> I see.
[15:48:39] <nathanw_> :)
[15:48:53] <mastermaw> skamikaze - i'm on php 5.2.9 - before options parameter was added
[15:49:34] <Phrogz> nathanw_: What's your problem/question?
[15:49:51] <rgr> Ive called resizeable on a div containing a textarea. The problem is that despite sizing that div in css some sort of jquery sizeing overrides it on create so they are appearing really small by default and not the default size I have set in css. Any ideas how I get around this?
[15:49:55] <nathanw_> so what I want to make is a function that grabs the contents of the nearest <p> element and inputs into a select. - it needs to check if its there, if it's there it needs to remove it, if it's not there it needs to add it
[15:50:31] <nathanw_> Phrogz: if you go here http://jsfiddle.net/kpzfx/ and look at the toggleDisabled function
[15:50:44] <nathanw_> Phrogz: I think the same thing will work with select
[15:51:18] <skamikaze> mastermaw: php5.2 reached it's end of life just fyi
[15:51:45] <nathanw_> am I making sense ?
[16:01:42] <Phrogz> nathanw_: No.
[16:01:55] <Phrogz> That is neither a question nor a description of a problem.
[16:02:48] <nathanw_> Phrogz: http://www.microhire.com/pacific2012
[16:03:18] <nathanw_> Phrogz: if you scroll down you'll see the product lists, then 3 inputs and a button.       rate, qty, total - add to order
[16:04:02] <nathanw_> Phrogz: There's a select at the bottom called "selected equipment" basically I want to put the product name and quantity into that select as an <option> on click
[16:06:16] <eddiemonge> $('#seletedEquipment').append('<option>'+product+' '+qty+'</option>');
[16:08:05] <nathanw_> eddiemonge: thankyou! i've managed to get it appending a generic text line.      '+product+'     <---- do I have to define that as a variable or something ?
[16:08:30] <eddiemonge> nathanw_: in your click event define it
[16:09:19] <eddiemonge> ?prev
[16:09:20] <bot-t> .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[16:09:24] <nathanw_> eddie: can you run me through how? keep in mind there are multiple elements on the page
[16:10:57] <nathanw_> eddie: currently this function is wrapped with some others in this >  $(this).closest("li").eq(0)    so it starts from the list item
[16:11:33] <eddiemonge> huh?
[16:11:57] <eddiemonge> why 1.4.2?
[16:12:10] <nathanw_> var qty= $.find("input.qty") 		 var product= $.find("p")
[16:12:24] <nathanw_> eddie: it's just what the sites using at the moment...
[16:12:51] <mikesm> How can I set up a mousedown event on a form or textarea? $().mousedown seems to work for everything except the form/textarea
[16:12:52] <eddiemonge> any reason you havent upgraded it?
[16:13:12] <nathanw_> not really, don't want to break any of the other JQ functions on the site...
[16:13:27] <eddiemonge> mikesm: forms themselves dont really have mousedown events. why not use .focus()?
[16:14:34] <mikesm> eddiemonge: focus would work, but what I am trying to do is have a click and drag form/textarea that I can move around. So I need to know mousedown and mouseup events
[16:14:51] <Clanger00> bgiframe.js causing issues with my dialog box in IE9, anyone have any advice? or point me in the right direction?
[16:14:55] <mikesm> eddiemonge, wouldn't focus not allow me to do something like that?
[16:15:38] <mikesm> (unless I guess I unfocus whenever the mouse is not on the Form itself?)
[16:16:06] <mikesm> (No wait I dont think I could even get that to work)
[16:16:54] <nathanw_> eddie: so how do I create an object?
[16:17:02] <eddiemonge> nathanw_:
[16:17:03] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/KqAHE/
[16:17:47] <eddiemonge> mikesm: just use a helper library like jQuery UI see ? .draggable()
[16:17:48] <bot-t> mikesm, UI/Draggables/draggable - http://docs.jquery.com/UI/draggable
[16:19:38] <nathanw_> eddie: thanks! that would work but my code looks like this http://jsfiddle.net/KqAHE/2/
[16:19:43] <mikesm> eddiemonge: I remember looking at that sometime in the past? Would I be able to use draggable() to only change the position of the form when I drag it to an appopriate div?
[16:19:44] <nathanw_> just need to go back a few more elements i think
[16:20:11] <mikesm> For example, say there are 4 divs, and the form can only be dragged into one of those 4 divs. Other than that the form can't be dragged anywhere.
[16:21:27] <mikesm> The dragging is only to decide which of the 4 divs to place the form. Once I know what div the form is to be put in, I just format it myself. So the dragging is used more as a selector rather than a completely free "drag" where you can drag something anywhere on the canvas
[16:23:22] <k1t> hiya folks
[16:23:34] <k1t> anyone know a bit nicer of a way to do this class toggle type deal? http://pastie.org/2646660
[16:24:03] <eddiemonge> mikesm: stop saying form
[16:24:30] <mikesm> eddiemonge: ok what should I say instead?
[16:24:42] <eddiemonge> mikesm: you dont drag the "form" itself. you drag the thing the drag handler is attached to. it could be the form but it probably should be something like a div
[16:26:11] <eddiemonge> nathanw_: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/KqAHE/7/
[16:28:12] <mikesm> eddiemonge: k so I place the "form" in a div and attach the drag handler to this container div, will jQuery know when I have clicked (or mousedown'ed) the container div (rather than the form)/ Even though the container div will be convered by the Form?
[16:28:36] <mikesm> **completely covered
[16:29:19] <mikesm> ..for Draggable(), sorry man if my newbness is missing your point
[16:30:18] <Raniy> The contents of the div, are the div from the context your talking.
[16:31:33] <nathanw_> eddie: this works for me, http://jsfiddle.net/KqAHE/9/
[16:32:21] <nathanw_> eddie: now I just need to get it to check if that <p> has been added - if it has been added, remove it. if it hasn't been added then add it.
[16:34:02] <eddiemonge> mikesm: why do you want to be able to drag around a "form" anyway?
[16:34:24] <BinaryKitten> eddiemonge we are not meant to ask why, just deliver resultss
[16:34:45] <eddiemonge> nathanw_: unique identifiers. use the id of the li and have it be the value of the option or use .data() to store the variable
[16:35:07] <eddiemonge> BinaryKitten: i violently oppose that theory. VIOLENTLY i tell ya
[16:35:54] <mikesm> Raniy: ok wow I figured it out.
[16:36:25] <mikesm> Raniy, I thought and tried about what  you said before lol but I was using a '#' for selecting a class hahaha
[16:37:51] <mikesm> eddiemonge: It's hard to explain, but it's kind of like a forum where you can insert a post in any order (in between any other two posts), so the input form isn't always on the bottom or top or w,e. it can be wherever the user is submitting
[16:38:18] <mikesm> eddiemonge: really it's not like that at all but that's the only practical example I can think of without getting to much into specifics
[16:39:27] <mikesm> So if I am inserting a post at the end and decide to instead insert it between the last and 2nd last posts, then I can drag the form in between those 2 posts and submit whatever there instead of at the end
[16:39:43] <mikesm> ..Just in case you're that curious
[16:43:16] <eddiemonge> mikesm: why not submit the form and then allow them to drag it after its rendered. then you can use sortable
[16:44:27] <mikesm> eddiemonge: you mean just let them drag the div itself that will be displaying what was submitted?
[16:45:51] <mikesm> That could be possible but I will have to rethink the overall structure a bit if I did something like that.
[16:46:01] <mikesm> It's a good idea though, I might use that somewhere actually
[16:47:02] <nathanw_> eddie: so what, give every <p> or <li> element an id and then check of that id has been inputted alreadhy
[16:47:07] <dipser> http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/
[16:47:41] <nathanw_> eddie: i've avoided doing that with my code thus far, can i do it by checking for the text nearest <p> string ?
[16:48:06] <mikesm> what did steve jobs die or someting
[16:48:09] <oojacoboo> wtf
[16:48:12] <nathanw_> steve jobs dead ?
[16:48:14] <nathanw_> O_O
[16:48:19] <oojacoboo> has to be him retiring
[16:48:26] <nathanw_> sounds like he died! lol
[16:48:30] <oojacoboo> can't be true
[16:48:38] <nathanw_> its on the apple site!
[16:48:55] <oojacoboo> I think it's his RETIREMENT
[16:49:08] <oojacoboo> I dunno though
[16:49:09] <mikesm> lol saying the world lost him...
[16:49:12] <mikesm> sounds like death
[16:49:20] <oojacoboo> shit
[16:49:32] <abjorn> yeah
[16:49:36] <abjorn> he died
[16:49:37] <mikesm> maybe they outsourced that little writeup
[16:49:37] <oojacoboo> how?!
[16:49:42] <abjorn> what do you mean how
[16:49:46] <abjorn> he's had fucking cancer
[16:49:47] <abjorn> for years
[16:49:49] <abjorn> lol
[16:49:49] <oojacoboo> sounds like an evil prank
[16:49:57] <nathanw_> lol
[16:50:01] <oojacoboo> yea, but the day after the apple announcement
[16:50:04] <abjorn> this is not in any way surprising
[16:50:05] <ColKurtz> http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/apple-says-steve-jobs-has-died/2011/10/05/gIQAS3ISOL_story.html
[16:50:09] <oojacoboo> so what
[16:50:12] <enjoycrf> thats fake
[16:50:17] <coldhead> who is steve jobs?
[16:50:20] <oojacoboo> yea, exactly
[16:50:31] <abjorn> coldhead: some douchebag who isnt worth our sympathy
[16:50:36] <oojacoboo> gotta be fake
[16:50:54] <mikesm> some say its fake but the majority of the discussion boards conclude its not fake
[16:50:59] <coldhead> whoever he is, the lesson when someone dies is this "glad it wasn't me!"
[16:51:06] <ColKurtz> http://www.npr.org/2011/10/05/123826622/apple-visionary-steve-jobs-dies-at-56
[16:51:06] <vladikoff> http://www.apple.com/ guys
[16:51:09] <mikesm> unless it was hacked
[16:51:17] <abjorn> well, while I wouldn't put such a tasteless publicity stunt past steve jobs, i doubt its faked
[16:51:18] <mikesm> maybe apple.com got hacked who knows
[16:51:32] <oojacoboo> hacked
[16:51:34] <enjoycrf> i dont see it on cnn
[16:51:37] <oojacoboo> hacked, gotta be
[16:51:51] <enjoycrf> maybe steve jobs did it
[16:51:54] <enjoycrf> lol
[16:51:56] <darcyclarke> ...
[16:52:00] <mikesm> watch apple stock
[16:52:03] <darcyclarke> yep
[16:52:05] <mikesm> plummet
[16:52:08] <mikesm> maybe lol
[16:52:09] <oojacoboo> I think that's the point
[16:52:09] <darcyclarke> gunna drop
[16:52:15] <coldhead> i implore you to bitch on twitter about the crappy html on that tribute page
[16:52:16] <oojacoboo> right after the announcement of the 4gs
[16:52:21] <enjoycrf> now he is on virgin air to the island
[16:52:22] <coldhead> that's what he would have wanted
[16:52:36] <coldhead> too much for snover :(
[16:52:38] <mikesm> the island?
[16:52:48] <mikesm> on the TV show Lost?

[16:53:24] <nathanw_> yeah i saw it was an image lol
[16:53:25] <oojacoboo> I doubt that's the address they would have used, but maybe so
[16:54:02] <nathanw_> anyone know how to check if a string has is in an option
[16:54:26] <enjoycrf> guys relax steve jobs is right here
[16:54:52] <stevejobs> did someone call?
[16:54:56] <nathanw_> LOL
[16:55:08] <enjoycrf> ya steve i told them alrady
[16:55:13] <abjorn> go back to being fucking dead you money hungry pig
[16:55:27] <Guest41404> geez, these anonymous pricks!
[16:55:32] <Guest41404> damnit
[16:55:37] <nathanw_> -__-
[16:55:47] <nathanw_> anyone writing jquery in here ?
[16:55:50] <Guest41404> who did that
[16:56:15] <oojacoboo> how'd that happen, how'd I lose my nick like that?
[16:56:50] <abjorn> magic
[16:56:59] <mikesm> this isn't a jquery irc anymore
[16:57:05] <mikesm> it's dedicated to Steve Jobs
[16:57:08] <mikesm> now
[16:57:17] <marekweb> the internet is now about steve jobs
[16:57:31] <oojacoboo> did he died?
[16:57:37] <coldhead> that is so true, marekweb
[16:57:39] <coldhead> well said
[16:57:39] <jowop> i'm trying to think of a way to display live traffic on my website. i really dont want to poll the server for the data since it would be coming in large chunks. i've looked at comet and it looks like the best solution. however i'm having an extremely difficult time trying to find a comet client for jquery. is there really nothing out there except for the one from 2008?
[16:57:41] <mikesm> all my posts are gonna be about the real jesus, Steve

[16:58:38] <abjorn> "When Atari hired Jobs and Woz to write the code for the iconic Atari game Breakout, the pair earned a $5000 bonus for completing the work, largely done by Woz. But Jobs kept the bonus a secret, and only paid his partner $375. When his daughter Lisa was born in 1978, he spent two years denying he was her father. His denials forced her and her mother to support themselves on welfare. In the workplace he's often been described as t
[16:59:03] <abjorn> yeah we should clearly mourn his passing
[16:59:07] <abjorn> im gonna go play rage :D
[16:59:33] <coldhead> take it to #stevejobs for a celebration of his live and #ripstevejobs for a celebration of his death
[17:00:32] <mikesm> it's only a matter of time before Apple falls now
[17:00:37] <troubleman> http://home.no/dwaynie/the_beat.mp3
[17:00:45] <mikesm> Could be 20 years if the core is good enough but I doubt it
[17:01:00] <troubleman> mikesm: vision 2020
[17:01:06] <mikesm> So with Apple down, Micro down, Facebook is looking to assume control over the internet
[17:01:33] <Zelest> when did Apple have control over the internet?
[17:01:45] <enjoycrf> calm down every1
[17:01:48] <mikesm> go.....Google Plus (even though google+ aint that great yet)
[17:02:10] <Dave_Stein> i'm pretty sure Steve Jobs death isn't ruining the company since they already transferred CEOs and people are pretty confident in Cook so far
[17:02:13] <Zelest> love or hate Apple, a great person will be missed.
[17:02:23] <mikesm> Zelest, apple didnt but they were at least another player who would change the game and possible ruin it for someone else aka Mark Zuckerberg
[17:02:32] <coldhead> MY APPLE PRODUCTS HAVE LOST RESALE VALUE!!
[17:02:32] <mikesm> plus Steve Jobs apparently fucking hated Zuckerberg
[17:02:33] <Zelest> the stock will probably go down for a few days.. then return as usual
[17:02:43] <Dave_Stein> correct Zelest
[17:02:56] <coldhead> mikesm: everyone hates zuckerberg
[17:02:57] <Zelest> just as it did when Cooks took over.. or 4S was released :P
[17:02:59] <coldhead> it's the human condition
[17:03:03] <mikesm> lol
[17:03:10] <Dave_Stein> haha true
[17:03:16] <Dave_Stein> but he really is a douche in person soooo
[17:03:19] <mikesm> Yeah but Cook is not the original visionary
[17:03:28] <mikesm> So there is a disconnect there
[17:03:42] <Dave_Stein> there are plenty of companies that go on with a different CEO so I'm not too worried
[17:03:50] <Zelest> mikesm, well, jesus died long ago, yet we have a lot of religious retards around still ;)
[17:03:50] <Dave_Stein> not that i'd worry anyway im not an apple fanboy ha
[17:03:51] <mikesm> only company's with huge monopolies can survive in the tech industry without their true visionary
[17:04:13] <Dave_Stein> also they probably planned out a minimum of 5 years in their pipeline
[17:04:22] <mikesm> Zelest, yes but an idea can always be around, technology gets adopted way faster and loses value way faster than an idea
[17:04:49] <mikesm> (talking aboout hardware more I guess)
[17:05:11] <coldhead> we should all go have candlelit vigils at our local apple stores
[17:05:17] <Zelest> Speaking of which.. Countless people are learning Jobs died on devices that would not exist without his vision. That's a legacy.
[17:05:33] <coldhead> Zelest: you just made me throw up a little
[17:05:41] <Zelest> good for you :)
[17:05:51] <nathanw_> http://jsfiddle.net/8ZvC5/    - how to I rewrite that to check an option and add or remove the option
[17:05:51] <coldhead> I HEARD STEVE JOBS INVENTED THE ALPHABET
[17:06:00] <mikesm> all hail Mark Zuckerberg
[17:06:05] <Zelest> I'm not saying he invented anything..
[17:06:18] <mikesm> the sooner you join his side the less youll suffer down the road
[17:06:22] <coldhead> you're saying he had excellent 20/20 vision
[17:06:23] <Zelest> But he sure pushed the technology field forward by a lot
[17:06:52] <enjoycrf> no he didnt
[17:07:24] <mikesm> Steve Jobs made common visions lucrative
[17:07:26] <mikesm> thats all
[17:07:34] <enjoycrf> macs are great tho but still too expansive
[17:07:36] <mikesm> In the right place at the right time
[17:08:23] <mikesm> How hard is it really to see the first computer, and see that Woznak is a genius that managed to build the smallest personal computer and not think -> hmmmmm we can make a lot of money here
[17:08:51] <mikesm> Takes an IQ of over 125 maybe
[17:09:44] <ckknight> sticking to mainframes is the safe bet, mikesm
[17:09:51] <ckknight> nobody gets fired for recommending IBM
[17:10:11] <mikesm> lol
[17:11:00] <enjoycrf> i better leave
[17:11:05] <enjoycrf> its getting crazy in here
[17:11:16] <enjoycrf> dont want to get trampled
[17:11:32] <cbobo> if i want to do the same thing on two elements how can I do that?
[17:11:53] <cbobo> can I do something like $('#id1').$('#id2').show(); ?
[17:12:05] <Brodingo> a comma will do
[17:12:19] <Brodingo> $('#id1,id2').show()
[17:12:30] <Brodingo> ugh with the # of course
[17:12:32] <cbobo> okay thanks
[17:12:43] <Brodingo> just liek css
[17:13:08] <cbobo> If I want to set the value of a text input box to nothing, I can simply do $("input").val(""); right?
[17:13:15] <cbobo> for all the input boxes
[17:13:38] <eddiemonge> cbobo: yes
[17:13:57] <cbobo> cool, because I know just .val() gives me the value
[17:14:33] <eddiemonge> its a getter and a setter
[17:14:45] <mikesm> Do you guys get paid to sit in this webchat?
[17:14:55] <mikesm> and answer questions
[17:15:01] <coldhead> not that my employer is aware
[17:15:03] <coldhead> but yes
[17:15:29] <mikesm> really? that's sweet
[17:17:26] <cbobo> if I positing something with: margin:0 auto;
[17:17:27] <starsinmypockets> anyone mind giving me a pointer here... http://jsfiddle.net/VkLMS/
[17:17:53] <cbobo> and then I run some jq ui .effects on it, some of the effects make it go all the way to the right while running the effect
[17:17:57] <cbobo> is there a fix for that?
[17:18:05] <starsinmypockets> I'm trying to append a variable to a string such as var i =0; $(this).append("foo" + i);
[17:21:13] <cbobo> http://jsfiddle.net/VkLMS/3/
[17:21:16] <cbobo> like that right?
[17:21:25] <cbobo> how do u get the jsfiddle to run anyway?
[17:21:36] <cbobo> i can't get it to write console.log or anything
[17:22:01] <coldhead> you have a syntax error, cbobo
[17:22:07] <coldhead> which is preventing the script from running
[17:22:09] <coldhead> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string
[17:22:15] <coldhead> line 22
[17:22:36] <coldhead> also a bunch of PHP which it won't know what to do with

[17:24:01] <Phrogz> "Welcome to an hour ago" say the snarky ones who want to appear cooler than thou.
[17:24:17] <kanzie> amid_hasan: yeah an hour ago apple.com has a beautiful tribute
[17:24:26] <coldhead> terribly moving
[17:25:10] <amid_hasan> kanzie i dont give a crap about apple
[17:25:21] <kanzie> amid_hasan: ok
[17:25:24] <amid_hasan> never liked how they supported child slave labor
[17:25:27] <amid_hasan> and factory suicides
[17:25:40] <kanzie> amid_hasan: I noted that down so the information is safe with me now
[17:25:47] <amid_hasan> aggresive borderline negotiations with its vendors to get the best price and make the most profit
[17:25:56] <kanzie> amid_hasan: yes yes, now we can move on.
[17:26:02] <xtrci> hello guys, can anyone help me here? i don't understand why my live search stops working when i change the page for example
[17:26:18] <xtrci> http://dev.markerout.com login : mdiasloureiro@gmail.com password: teste
[17:26:32] <xtrci> in the main page if i do a search in the header it works
[17:26:38] <xtrci> but if i go to someones profile
[17:26:51] <cbobo> o i see lol
[17:26:53] <xtrci> it loads the whole page inside that div
[17:26:55] <cbobo> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/darkiss/96YY3/2/
[17:27:04] <xtrci> http://jsfiddle.net/6qNEs/1/
[17:27:06] <xtrci> here's the code
[17:27:19] <starsinmypockets> coldhead: "foo"+i+"foo" did it - thanks! :)
[17:27:41] <coldhead> huzzah!
[17:27:47] <coldhead> universeinmyeyes
[17:29:35] <juha_> i'm losing my mind over this stupid bug that some stupid dev before me has created ugh
[17:32:40] <coldhead> juha_: try restarting your browser
[17:32:53] <juha_> i'm going to restart my head with some vodka shots
[17:33:48] <kanzie> so doing the module-approach in my code takes away my ability to use google compiler to test casting of every param, is that right?
[17:33:52] <juha_> every time when i think i fixed the issue, it pops back up.. ugh
[17:36:59] <nathanw_> hey can some one help me creating a function
[17:37:07] <nathanw_> http://jsfiddle.net/KqAHE/9/
[17:37:14] <nathanw_> I've got the first half of it working.
[17:38:01] <avent> Hi there
[17:38:31] <nathanw_> Hi
[17:38:37] <avent> I've got a question
[17:38:47] <nathanw_> Sure... i don't know very much though :(
[17:39:04] <avent> It's regarding clone()
[17:39:42] <nathanw_> I haven't used that before sorry
[17:40:13] <avent> Alright
[17:40:26] <avent> Anyone else here who would be willing to help?
[17:41:02] <avent> So many people and everyone is afk D:
[17:42:18] <nathanw_> yeah all afk at tthe moment
[17:42:21] <nathanw_> usually some in here can help
[17:42:47] <avent> I'll just stay put and wait for someone to come :)
[17:42:52] <avent> http://jsfiddle.net/KkTyg/
[17:42:54] <avent> Here's my code
[17:42:55] <nathanw_> same
[17:43:20] <nathanw_> you can remove the html tags you've got in there <script> etc
[17:43:29] <nathanw_> on JS fiddle in the JS section you just put the raw JS in
[17:44:07] <Coderah> avent: dont forget to state your problem. also a rule of this channel is don't ask to ask just ask, so remember that for next time :)
[17:44:23] <Coderah> I will be back in a few and if you still need help I will try
[17:44:37] <nathanw_> Coderah :)
[17:44:41] <avent> http://jsfiddle.net/KkTyg/4/
[17:44:47] <avent> updated code.
[17:45:10] <nathanw_> avent - add in the html for your example
[17:45:24] <avent> it's lengthy
[17:45:28] <nathanw_> coderah let me know when you're back
[17:45:30] <avent> I'll paste the relevant parts
[17:45:33] <nathanw_> avent: doesn't have to be all of it
[17:45:39] <nathanw_> avent: just enough for the JS example to work
[17:46:28] <mikesm> is there any reason to use double quotes like $("") rather than single quotes $('')? Or just preference?
[17:46:31] <avent> http://jsfiddle.net/KkTyg/5/
[17:46:40] <mikesm> do they both mean string?
[17:46:47] <avent> For some reason the cloned element won't insert at all
[17:47:30] <nathanw_> i think its just preference... but not 100% sure
[17:47:41] <blindMoe> avent: did you even read the error console?
[17:47:56] <blindMoe> http://jsfiddle.net/KkTyg/6/
[17:47:59] <blindMoe> mispelling
[17:49:41] <avent> what was mispelled, sorry you lost me. and where can I view the error console?
[17:50:28] <Coderah> avent: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 that will give you info about debugging javascript/jquery
[17:51:13] <Coderah> nathanw_: did you need something?
[17:51:19] <nathanw_> Coderah: thanks for that link!
[17:51:25] <nathanw_> Coderah: yes , one moment
[17:51:59] <nathanw_> Coderah: if you take a look at my page here : http://www.microhire.com/pacific2012
[17:52:20] <avent> Thanks, I'll look into it.
[17:52:20] <nathanw_> Coderah: Scroll down and see the products with , rate, qty and total inputs - then an add to order button
[17:53:08] <avent> brb
[17:53:17] <nathanw_> Coderah: if you put a number in the quantity field and click add, you'll notice a few things will happen. but scroll down til you see the selected equipment text area
[17:53:35] <nathanw_> Coderah: on click it's adding an option with the qty and product name
[17:53:53] <nathanw_> Coderah: but I need toggle functionality the same as the disabled="disabled" function I've got in there
[17:54:17] <Coderah> nathanw_: ah okay you need to remove it the next time you click gotcha
[17:54:58] <Coderah> nathanw_: you can give <options> id's i would do something like that
[17:55:15] <Coderah> nathanw_: then you can do if element exists remove it rather than add it
[17:55:46] <nathanw_> Coderah: exactly, but the id would need to be generated by jQuery and be unique
[17:56:02] <nathanw_> Coderah: because the user may choose to add / remove other products
[17:56:03] <Coderah> why don't we do it by index then
[17:56:24] <nathanw_> how does that work /
[17:56:49] <Coderah> nathanw_: when you add the option set the id to the .index() of the li element that houses the add to order form
[17:57:03] <Coderah> and do the same for removing
[17:57:40] <nathanw_> Coderah, i'll put my current code into a fiddle hold on..
[17:57:45] <Coderah> nathanw_: kk
[17:58:20] <cakehero> What's the best way to have an input text element show a certain format (dollars or percentage for instance)
[18:01:00] <nathanw_> Coderah: http://jsfiddle.net/KqAHE/9/
[18:01:09] <nathanw_> So that's adding the correct contents onclick
[18:01:17] <nathanw_> just need to create the toggle functionality
[18:01:25] <Coderah> nathanw_: alrighty one sec
[18:03:04] <kanzie> has anyone found a good structure for the module-pattern and jsdoc3?
[18:03:57] <avent> For me I got the debugger working, and the error I am getting is this: "$ is not defined" and I do not understand why
[18:04:12] <imsky> i'm gonna miss him
[18:05:40] <Coderah> nathanw_: http://jsfiddle.net/KqAHE/23/
[18:06:28] <cakehero> i miss you imsky
[18:06:51] <imsky> hmm
[18:07:27] <Coderah> avent: assuming you are using jsfiddle make sure you have jQuery selected on the left side instead of mooTools
[18:07:44] <Coderah> avent: that error means jQuery is not included
[18:09:05] <nathanw_> Coderah: Awesome!!! That works
[18:09:13] <nathanw_> Coderah: Now to understand how you did it...
[18:09:31] <Coderah> nathanw_: :) if you have trouble understanding it just ask
[18:10:29] <nathanw_> Coderah: what does this do ?    var $index = $(this).closest('li').index();
[18:10:51] <avent> Coderah: It should be included. I can use other jQuery methods without a problem
[18:10:52] <Coderah> nathanw_: thats grabbing the index of the li element
[18:11:08] <Coderah> so if its the first element its 0 if its the fifth its 4
[18:12:05] <nathanw_> Coderah: is this similar to css z-index?
[18:12:31] <Coderah> nathanw_: nope, that is for setting what object shows over other ones etc
[18:12:56] <Coderah> nathanw_: think of .index() as converting the parent element to an array and then finding the index that the element you have selected is at
[18:13:21] <Coderah> avent: well the error i am getting when i use your jsFiddle with jQuery selected is    Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'inserAtfter'
[18:13:31] <nathanw_> Coderah: sorry I'm not sure what array's are/ how they work
[18:13:36] <Coderah> avent: i am not sure why you are getting the $ error you must have something wrong in a different part of your code
[18:14:15] <Coderah> nathanw_: an array is a way of storing multiple objects (anything) in a variable. Not to be confused with dictionaries/lists
[18:14:28] <Coderah> in a single variable*
[18:15:18] <Coderah> nathanw_: first result on google: http://developer.uievolution.com/docs/en/LangRef/Arrays_Explained.html
[18:15:21] <Coderah> nathanw_: give that a read
[18:15:34] <nathanw_> will do thanks
[18:15:41] <nathanw_> Coderah: so it's just like a group?
[18:16:24] <Coderah> nathanw_: more or less yes an array can be looked at as a group of variables but they don't have names usually its indexes (you can add named variables though)
[18:16:43] <avent> Coderah: How do you see errors on jsfiddle. I have jQuery selected but I don't see any tab for errors
[18:16:59] <nathanw_> Coderah: right so, what you've done in the first line there is set the <li> object as the first (0) index ?
[18:17:00] <Coderah> avent: it is not a tab use your debugger
[18:17:32] <Coderah> nathanw_: incorrect. I am getting the index of the <li> element in relation to the parent <ul>
[18:17:47] <Coderah> so its a unique number based on the order that it was defined
[18:19:09] <nathanw_> OH
[18:19:27] <nathanw_> So you're finding out which <li> it is
[18:20:09] <nathanw_> so <ul><li><li><li></ul>   if the button is clicked on the 3rd one, your first line differentiates it from the 1st and 2nd.
[18:20:32] <Coderah> nathanw_: yep
[18:20:44] <nathanw_> yay!
[18:20:53] <Coderah> nathanw_: since arrays start at 0 index the 3rd would be 2
[18:20:59] <Coderah> nathanw_: whereas the first is 0
[18:21:12] <avent> Coderah: I am not getting any errors. Am I doing somethign wrong? Here's a picture: http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6821/probsz.png
[18:21:29] <avent> something*
[18:21:33] <nathanw_> Coderah: yes.... so the opposite to css z-index. in which 0 is lowest
[18:21:45] <Coderah> avent: click the add book button.. the code that is wrong is inside that event it needs to be triggered to error out
[18:22:02] <Coderah> nathanw_: remove any association to z-index and arrays in your mind :P
[18:22:22] <nathanw_> ok :p
[18:22:40] <nathanw_> I'm not associating but just trying to link it to something i already know
[18:22:50] <avent> Coderah: Thanks. Found the error, let's see if that fixes it
[18:23:06] <Coderah> avent: glad to help :)
[18:24:13] <nathanw_> Coderah: if ($('select option#' + $index).length) {          $('select option#' + $index).remove();    <====   So  $index).length is just another way of finding out if it's there yeah? , if it's there remove
[18:24:35] <avent> Coderah: It didn't fix it. I'll grab some dinner and then I'll be back. Thanks so far though! :)
[18:25:34] <Coderah> Coderah: yeah length is a number that tells you how many objects were returned by the jquery selector.. if its 0 none existed (which can be seen as false in an if statement)
[18:26:16] <nathanw_> awesome, i read that somewhere earlier today
[18:26:28] <nathanw_> ok i understand that statement now
[18:27:17] <nathanw_> 1. finds out which <li> the button has been clicked on.   2. checks if an option exists / removes if exists  3. else creates
[18:27:34] <Coderah> nathanw_: yep
[18:27:40] <nathanw_> wohooo
[18:27:51] <nathanw_> ok some more visuals to do then a tiny bit more JS and its done :D
[18:27:55] <nathanw_> thanks so much for your help
[18:27:59] <nathanw_> where are you from
[18:28:00] <nathanw_> ?
[18:28:24] <bobdobbs> How do I create an array of jquery selectors? So far I have this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/703115/
[18:28:40] <Coderah> nathanw_: np. currently live in Ohio, very seriously hope to move to SF to work at startups
[18:28:47] <bobdobbs> This creates a list of elements. But what I'd like, is a list of selectors to those elements.
[18:30:23] <johnline> http://i.imgur.com/SyKTt.jpg
[18:30:26] <juha_> wtf steve jobs died
[18:30:40] <Coderah> juha_: yes he did..
[18:30:54] <juha_> very sad :(
[18:31:36] <Coderah> juha_: people die every day its always sad. look at what he has done for the world and be glad he lived to do those things :)
[18:31:47] <cbobo> what is the difference between .show and .fadeIn
[18:32:06] <Coderah> cbobo: fadeIn slowly fades the element in by using a CSS property
[18:32:37] <cbobo> but it will also still set the style=display:block; like .show will?
[18:32:47] <Coderah> cbobo: it should
[18:33:27] <cbobo> okay cool
[18:33:37] <cbobo> so diff is one has an effect
[18:33:45] <Coderah> cbobo: yep
[18:40:27] <bobdobbs> I'd like to do a operation on random element inside a target div. How do I create an array that contains jquery selectors that point to the children of my target div?
[18:41:08] <Coderah> bobdobbs: I have never heard of someone doing this but this is how I would do it http://jsfiddle.net/LU6G8/ it only returns selectors that that have classes or id's so that they are unique selectors but you should be able to work it to whatever you want
[18:41:25] <Coderah> bobdobbs: for what you ultimately want to do (what you just said) there is a better way one sec
[18:41:48] <bobdobbs> Coderah: thanks. studying that fiddle now.
[18:42:20] <deadly_jquery> HI
[18:42:42] <deadly_jquery> can someone look into, http://pastebin.com/iRuBevX9
[18:43:09] <bobdobbs> Coderah: yeah, I thought that there might be a better way, because when I googled, I couldn't see anyone generating an array of selectors.
[18:43:12] <deadly_jquery> i am not able to assign the sorted values to textarea
[18:43:26] <Coderah> bobdobbs: its an unconventional idea thats for sure haha
[18:43:31] <bobdobbs> I figured that if no-one else was doing it, I might be framing the problem in the wrong way
[18:44:25] <bobdobbs> Coderah: yeah. My immediate thinking is "this seems to convenient to me? Why is no-one else doing it?"
[18:45:18] <bobdobbs> The problem I'm working on can be solved by "get random element from target, do [thing] to it.
[18:45:35] <miketaylr> you probably want .val() deadly_jquery, not append()
[18:45:38] <bobdobbs> So I figured: first step - get a list of selectors!
[18:46:46] <deadly_jquery> miketaylr: when i try val, only the last value is displayed
[18:47:11] <miketaylr> oh right
[18:47:17] <Coderah> bobdobbs: my immediate thinking would bet get a list of all the children, just because that is easier done. it may or may not be more "expensive" though one sec working on an example
[18:47:25] <Coderah> -bet +be
[18:48:28] <bobdobbs> Coderah: ok
[18:48:53] <Coderah> bobdobbs: this is how i would select a random child element http://jsfiddle.net/LU6G8/2/ it will go down every tree though so if you only want first-level children use .children() instead of .find('*')
[18:49:46] <miketaylr> deadly_jquery: then rebuild the array into a string?
[18:49:58] <bobdobbs> Coderah: Hey man, thanks. That really helps.
[18:50:07] <Coderah> bobdobbs: no problem!
[18:50:10] <bobdobbs> :)
[18:50:31] <deadly_jquery> miketaylr: thought of it, its working fine, nick help
[18:51:20] <deadly_jquery> miketaylr: thanks
[18:51:39] <miketaylr> np
[18:59:32] <Zolrath> I'm not sure if what I want to do is possible/how it would be accomplished but right now I'm making a page that loads older content as you scroll down
[18:59:51] <Zolrath> but if you start somewhere in the middle, I'd like it to load newer content as you scroll up
[19:00:35] <Zolrath> but as is, when it loads new content it pushes the current content down, still leaving you at the top of the page, thus continually loading new content
[19:00:52] <Zolrath> Aside from scrolling the page down in response, is there a way to have new content push the top of the page up?
[19:04:35] <avent> Coderah: I'm back. Another helper here suggested the following: http://jsfiddle.net/KkTyg/6/
[19:05:00] <avent> What does the     event.stopPropagation();     return false; do?
[19:05:28] <Coderah> avent: simply stops the default action from occuring which is completely un-needed pretty much
[19:05:33] <Coderah> avent: in this case anyway
[19:05:42] <bryricker> hey all what function should I look up to select the image within an 'a' tag being hovered over?
[19:05:48] <Coderah> avent: if the A element had an href that would change the page it would stop it from changing
[19:06:59] <avent> Coderah: In other words if pressing the "Add a book"-link would send you to another page, it would prevent this?
[19:07:06] <bryricker> trying to replace an image with text on hover of the link in which it's contained, and then change it back on mouseout.
[19:07:07] <Coderah> avent: correct
[19:07:30] <avent> Coderah: Awesome, thanks. Should I still include it?
[19:07:39] <Coderah> avent: up to you, i wouldn't
[19:07:54] <Coderah> avent: actually.. because you are using "#" as the href that may cause the page to scroll up so leave it in
[19:08:25] <avent> Coderah: Yeah, that's what I was almost thinking. Thanks! This is a great learning experience :)
[19:08:40] <Coderah> bryricker: inside your event $(this).find('img')
[19:08:40] <coldhead> aww
[19:08:47] <Coderah> avent: no problem!
[19:09:14] <miketaylr> more like APhK amirite
[19:09:43] <bryricker> Coderah: thanks
[19:11:58] <avent> Coderah: I implemented it and it works, it still jumps to the top of the page though. Debugger says: event.stopPropagation is not a function
[19:12:17] <Coderah> avent: event.preventDefault i think is the correct one
[19:12:41] <avent> Coderah: I'll try it, thanks :)
[19:16:44] <avent> Codarah: I got it to work with the event.stopPropagation... Let me just quickly figure out exactly how :)
[19:19:12] <bryricker> Coderah: Should I be able to set a variable in the first argument of hover(), and then use it in the second? It doesn't seem to be working but I am probably doing it wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/QY33f/1/
[19:19:24] <avent> Codarah: Ah, I didn't include the .click at first but left it on .ready... Well works like a charm. Thanks so much :)
[19:19:26] <Coderah> bryricker: you will have to set a global variable
[19:19:41] <bryricker> Coderah: and then modify it from within the function?
[19:20:20] <Guest89894> woo irc
[19:20:44] <Coderah> bryricker: yep
[19:20:51] <Guest89894> Anone here know anything about the jqueryui datepicker? is there a jqueryui channel that i should be in?
[19:20:57] <bryricker> Coderah: thanks!
[19:21:41] <Guest89894> having issues with the uuid of a datepicker and not sure if its a bug or by design lol
[19:24:21] <Guest89894>     d.datepicker.uuid = (new Date).getTime();     d.datepicker.version = "1.8.13";     window["DP_jQuery_" + z] = d (end of jqueryUI datepicker, shouldn't d.datepicker.uuid be set to z? z is the uuid used throughout the plugin but it changes it at the end lol, so i have a datepicker that you can't do anything with because the onclick DP_Jquery{time} isnt the same as the object

[19:42:04] <bryricker> No problem! Thanks for the help again, I'll take a look.
[19:42:31] <bryricker> Coderah: Okay, good idea, thanks.
[19:44:26] <nathanw_> anyone ?
[19:45:51] <coldhead> please do
[19:48:32] <Hornet> $('#vidIcon').removeClass('openbound').addClass('active').unbind('click');
[19:48:38] <Hornet> 'missing : after property id'
[19:48:53] <Hornet> am I going mad or is that actually fine?
[19:49:22] <coldhead> that line is fine, Hornet
[19:49:25] <Guest89894> syntactically that looks correct
[19:49:27] <coldhead> it must be something else
[19:49:41] <Guest89894> could be the line before, i get that sometimes
[19:51:23] <Hornet> http://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=4861 well, that's the page
[19:51:47] <Hornet> yes I know it's inline, it's a temporary fix to something
[19:52:27] <Genesis730> hey coldhead
[19:52:38] <Hornet> nvm, got it
[19:52:40] <Hornet> typical
[19:53:57] <harpal> On form submit I would like to open popup modal dialog for confirmation and then If user gives yes in dialog, then submit form, else close dialog box. Here is my code. http://paste2.org/p/1692102
[19:54:49] <harpal> My problem is that when I click on yes button dialog box remain same, as its not submitting form. It try to bind submit function and reopen dialog box. Can any one help me
[19:55:19] <coldhead> Hornet: what was it?
[19:55:31] <coldhead> hi Genesis730
[19:56:44] <coldhead> harpal: i am guessing line 4 might be part of the problem
[19:56:55] <coldhead> the one that says to return false, no matter what
[19:57:41] <harpal> coldhead: But if I remove that line, Than at first time I submit button, then it will directly submit form. it will not wait for dialog box to open
[19:58:20] <harpal> I want to open dialog box when submit, then from dialog box if user click on yes button then it submits form.
[19:59:30] <Guest89894>     $('form#newmember').submit(function() {         $("#confirm").dialog("open");         return false;     }); try changing that to     $('form#newmember').submit(function(e) {         e.preventDefault(); $("#confirm").dialog("open");    });
[20:02:07] <coldhead> harpal: i think you need to submit the form from within the modal handler
[20:02:09] <Genesis730> coldhead: i'm gonna ask again :P are you the one i talked to the other day?
[20:02:20] <coldhead> possibly, Genesis730
[20:02:40] <Genesis730> I had someone in here help me with a database update with animation
[20:02:46] <coldhead> i have a drinking problem
[20:02:53] <coldhead> i have several drinking problems*
[20:02:56] <Genesis730> that was actually like a month ago??
[20:03:07] <coldhead> i had drinking problems a month ago
[20:03:09] <Genesis730> but it changed from 1 to 0 and animated green or red
[20:03:12] <Genesis730> LOL
[20:04:14] <harpal> Guest89894: That didnt helped. Still its not submittting form After dialog box opens
[20:04:24] <Genesis730> coldhead: anyways they said they had a better approach at it and i could check back to get some help
[20:04:47] <coldhead> well show us what you have and i'm sure someone will have ideas
[20:05:09] <harpal> coldhead: That I did, On yes button click I did $('form#newmember').submit();

[20:06:31] <tgodar> hi, search for a span by text() string value would be? "span[text='needle']" ?
[20:07:02] <coldhead> ?contains @ tgodar
[20:07:03] <bot-t> tgodar, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[20:07:21] <tgodar> i get ambigous matches, there params for contains to say exact match only?
[20:08:26] <coldhead> you will have to write a custom function for filter() to get an exact match
[20:08:31] <coldhead> ?filter
[20:08:31] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[20:08:35] <tgodar> suppose i could iterate over matches...
[20:08:43] <tgodar> gotcha.  thanks
[20:10:31] <tgodar> suppose i could just add a an id to the spans and use it too
[20:10:52] <coldhead> or a class
[20:11:14] <abjorn> I feel like getting drunk tonight now
[20:11:23] <tgodar> kinda root of my silly issue, they are unique identifiers
[20:11:58] <coldhead> good luck, tgodar
[20:12:12] <tgodar> ty
[20:12:22] <tgodar> good luck, abjorn
[20:12:44] <abjorn> I'll need it, it takes a lot to get me drunk
[20:12:55] <coldhead> pour one out for steve jobs
[20:12:55] <abjorn> actually, i dont even have enough alcohol to do so
[20:12:56] <abjorn> oh well
[20:13:10] <abjorn> psh
[20:13:15] <abjorn> I ain't wasting alcohol for Jobs
[20:16:27] <abjorn> Well, I'm bored with this Steve Jobs business now. I'm going to program.

[20:16:57] <Guest89894> i swear, my graphic designer is out at like his funeral. he's been gone for 1.5hrs on a 30min lunch break
[20:16:57] <abjorn> well, actually, try and compile V8 then drink heavily when I inevitably run into issues
[20:17:05] <abjorn> hahaha

[20:32:28] <versatiletech> has anyone created a custom validation method with the validation plugin that checks multiple fields, not just one? I'm trying to see if there's a way to do it without having to attach it randomly to one field so that it works.

[20:40:11] <avent> I have my files uploaded to my webserver and there the jquery scripts work like a charm but on my own computer, with the same folder structure and file names it seems to not work. Debugger says: $ is not defined [Break On This Error] $("#add_book").click(function(event){
[20:42:14] <cypha> I need to use jQuery.ajax's 'accepts' or 'headers' options within a script I already have, and I wasn't sure where exactly I should be putting it --> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/example/application.js#L19
[20:42:33] <cypha> do I put it on the main function, or on $('#fileupload').fileupload()?
[20:42:51] <cypha> hi yogurt_truck :)
[20:59:05] <avent> any helpers around?
[21:16:40] <cypha> I need to use jQuery.ajax's 'accepts' or 'headers' options within a script I already have, and I wasn't sure where exactly I should be putting it (the main/unnamed function or $('fileupload')? --> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/example/application.js#L19
[21:18:45] <cypha> ::lots of tumbleweed::
[21:19:27] <context> check the fileupload docs ?
[21:19:34] <cypha> i did
[21:19:40] <cypha> nothing about jquery.ajax
[21:19:58] <context> maybe it doesn't give you a way to override them ?
[21:20:02] <context> check the source?
[21:20:26] <cypha> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/issues/104#issuecomment-2302105
[21:20:27] <socialhapy>  Issue #104 on jQuery-File-Upload, reported by javierv (6m, 3w ago): Request headers in Firefox

[21:21:29] <socialhapy>  Issue #104 on jQuery-File-Upload, reported by javierv (6m, 3w ago): Request headers in Firefox
[21:21:39] <context> says a release was made that lets you override headers.
[21:21:45] <cypha> yeah
[21:22:07] <cypha> but I dunno how to properly add in a jQuery.ajax line
[21:22:26] <cypha> whether it's on the function or on the id# of the upload box
[21:24:05] <context> the it shows examples of hte fileupload() call returning the jqXHR object
[21:24:33] <context> so try calling headers() on it ?
[21:24:52] <cypha> where is a jqXHR object returned?
[21:25:21] <context> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/API
[21:26:07] <context> or try setting accepts: or headers: IN the options
[21:26:14] <context> try things, mess around, break stuff
[21:27:07] <context> options.headers = $.extend(options.headers,
[21:27:18] <context> read the sourcecode... just set headers in the options for fileupload()
[21:27:48] <cypha> jqueryfileupload-ui.js?
[21:27:49] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hi
[21:28:01] <Nicolas_Leonida2> why am I not catching all the textareas here? http://jsfiddle.net/gYQxs/
[21:28:17] <cypha> oh i see
[21:28:25] <cypha> context, but I don't think I'm supposed to alter that file
[21:28:39] <cypha> I think the correct way would be to override that
[21:30:36] <Cork> Nicolas_Leonida2: you should, what fails? (btw id="textX" has to be uniq)
[21:31:16] <yogurt_truck> Nicolas_Leonida2: you have to select jQuery as a framework
[21:31:31] <Nicolas_Leonida2> ok I'm trying this
[21:31:33] <Nicolas_Leonida2> http://jsfiddle.net/gYQxs/3/
[21:31:40] <Nicolas_Leonida2> when I click RUN nothing is alerted
[21:31:55] <Nicolas_Leonida2> even though for each textarea it should alert once
[21:32:28] <Cork> "missing ) after argument list"
[21:32:29] <yogurt_truck> you got syntax errors
[21:32:35] <Cork> error console ftw ;)
[21:33:36] <yogurt_truck> Nicolas_Leonida2: why all the global variables?
[21:33:48] <Nicolas_Leonida2> http://jsfiddle.net/gYQxs/4/
[21:33:55] <Nicolas_Leonida2> ok now it says hi infinitely lol
[21:34:27] <cypha> ok, still at a loss here
[21:35:06] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I'll tell you guys in a second, I'm trying to make this part work out of my project first
[21:36:06] <cypha> context, I still can't figure out where to write a jQuery.ajax funtion
[21:36:08] <cypha> function
[21:36:20] <cypha> i don't see any examples using it either
[21:38:32] <context> you dont write function
[21:38:42] <context> you give headers options IN THE OPTIONS FOR fileupload
[21:38:56] <context> $(whatever your crap).fileupload(OPTIONS GO HERE PUT HEADERS: {WHATEVER});
[21:39:58] <cypha> AHh
[21:40:08] <cypha> ok
[21:40:56] <cypha> context, then what did he mean by jquery.ajax options?
[21:41:08] <cypha> if it all goes under the same jquery-style options anyway?
[21:41:58] <ajpiano> he meant that any options that could be passed to jQuery.ajax can also be passed as options to this plugin as it passes them through to it, presumably
[21:42:39] <cypha> aahh
[21:42:54] <context> the headers options gets passed to $.ajax() when the plugin calls it.
[21:46:39] <cypha> so for example, I put $('#fileupload').fileupload({headers:'text/plain'}); and that did nothing
[21:48:15] <cypha> and interestingly enough, if I use accepts: 'text/plain', I get nothing in the accept header
[21:50:05] <cypha> accepts: 'anything' apparently makes no accept header show up in the request
[22:30:28] <oksushi> if you are looking for a small CMS I recommend textpattern it does have an admin interface though
[22:30:30] <oksushi> gah
[22:30:54] <oksushi> mispaste, sorry peeps!
[22:31:14] <coldhead> thanks for clarifying, oksushi
[22:31:22] * oksushi bows
[22:31:23] <coldhead> i was about to start using textpattern
[22:31:26] <coldhead> but now i won't
[22:31:28] <coldhead> close call!
[22:31:43] <oksushi> every time I type an emdash my IRC client seems to take me to a random channel
[22:41:21] <friskd> When jquery does an ajax delete
[22:41:32] <friskd> the data is not automatically added to the url.
[22:41:46] <coldhead> what is an ajax delete?
[22:42:03] <coldhead> type: 'DELETE' ?
[22:42:05] <friskd> yes
[22:42:57] <coldhead> the docs only say that it's not well supported by browsers :(
[22:43:03] <blackspotwiggins> friskd, only get adds params to url
[22:43:13] <blackspotwiggins> put and delete behave like post
[22:43:50] <blackspotwiggins> the server should not care anyway
[22:44:07] <blackspotwiggins> and you cant do put/delete from regular forms, so it's not an issue tbh
[22:45:42] <friskd> well. I just want to know the standard.
[22:45:47] <friskd> Because technically
[22:45:56] <friskd> a DELETE should not have "post" data
[22:46:00] <blackspotwiggins> how so?
[22:46:16] <friskd> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2752415/restful-issue-with-data-access-when-using-http-delete-method
[22:47:44] <friskd> i guess it really doesn't matter.
[22:48:25] <blackspotwiggins> php has issues
[22:48:40] <friskd> for ex: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-56
[22:48:44] <friskd> if you look at delete
[22:48:54] <blackspotwiggins> i think the first answer is misleading, you should use delete
[22:49:01] <blackspotwiggins> since you are removing a resource
[22:49:02] <friskd> The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource
[22:49:02] <friskd>    identified by the Request-URI.
[22:49:14] <friskd> hence i would assume the the data should be passed via the URI
[22:49:18] <friskd> not POST data.
[22:50:01] <blackspotwiggins> well, the uri defines the resource
[22:50:21] <blackspotwiggins> same as with post or put
[22:50:50] <blackspotwiggins> if you have /item/2 and you PUT stuff there, it seems logical to have the parameters in post form, not in the uri
[23:11:42] <friskd> yea. I went with allowing post data as well.
[23:12:33] <coldhead> blackspotwiggin5 always knows the score
[23:12:41] <coldhead> follow him heedlessly
[23:12:45] <coldhead> it got me where i am today
[23:15:00] <blackspotwiggins> coldhead, isnt this your first day?
[23:17:55] <coldhead> it got me where i am later on today, since this morning*
[23:17:57] <coldhead> thanks blackspotwiggins
[23:18:06] <blackspotwiggins> :)
[23:20:58] <someprimetime> I'm using: $("div").closest(".form-variant"); to select the next form-variant container and perform a toggle on it.. problem is, it's select ALL of them and toggling them...
[23:21:09] <someprimetime> what am i doing wrong, exactly?
[23:21:19] <someprimetime> i tried next() as well, and same thing
[23:21:28] <someprimetime> is there a way to limit the traversal through the DOM?
[23:21:31] <someprimetime> to say 1?
[23:22:18] <blackspotwiggins> someprimetime, use an id?
[23:22:28] <blackspotwiggins> there are probably many divs on your page
[23:22:42] <someprimetime> blackspotwiggins: i wanted to make it as ambiguous as possible but i guess i'll do that instead
[23:23:13] <blackspotwiggins> if you want to select _one_ div, you need to identify the one
[23:23:19] <blackspotwiggins> and the most sensible way is to use id
[23:23:20] <Kambfhase> why dont you look for the next .form-variant from$(this) ?
[23:23:43] <Kambfhase> ie. relative rather than all
[23:23:57] <blackspotwiggins> Kambfhase, why do you think he even has a this?
[23:24:09] <blackspotwiggins> and next() and closest() are not really equivalent
[23:24:35] <Kambfhase> i know, but he said ` to select the __next__ form-variant container`
[23:36:36] <nachtkriecher> can anyone help me sort out my IE problem?
[23:37:00] <nachtkriecher> it's really a CSS question, but the folks at #css seem to be away
[23:37:49] <nachtkriecher> it does involve jquery, so it's not like i have no reason to be here
[23:41:20] <coldhead> without any more details, the only suggestion i have is try {zoom:1}
[23:41:36] <nachtkriecher> haha
[23:41:55] <nachtkriecher> {zoom:1}
[23:42:04] <nachtkriecher> hmm still seems borked
[23:42:33] <coldhead> ben nadel says that fixes 90% of IE CSS issues
[23:42:42] <coldhead> so i guess this is in the other 10%
[23:42:44] <coldhead> whatever it is
[23:42:47] <nachtkriecher> ha
[23:43:14] <nachtkriecher> but where do i put it
[23:43:22] <nachtkriecher> in the css i assume
[23:43:35] <nachtkriecher> but like html level?
[23:43:41] <nachtkriecher> or the element that's "not working"?
[23:46:31] <faraway> nachtkriecher: at the element that does not look/behave correct
[23:47:20] <nachtkriecher> mm, didnt fix it
[23:53:12] <coldhead> nachtkriecher: you never actually said what the problem is
[23:53:25] <coldhead> is why you're not getting great solutions
[23:53:31] <nachtkriecher> ha
[23:53:32] <nachtkriecher> oops
[23:53:34] <coldhead> yo necolas
[23:53:39] <nachtkriecher> i have on two other channels
[23:53:44] <necolas> yo coldhead
[23:53:58] <nachtkriecher> http://www.nachtkriecher.com/scripts/test.php
[23:54:21] <nachtkriecher> so in IE9, the menus that pop up on "Document Type" "Document Status" and "Class Code"
[23:54:36] <nachtkriecher> they are always in the same spot regardless of if you've scrolled or not
[23:55:05] <nachtkriecher> as if they are position:fixed; and not position:absolute
[23:57:03] <nachtkriecher> dang i gotta go soon
[23:57:27] <faraway> nachtkriecher: did you tried to set the "th" to "position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px"
[23:57:35] <nachtkriecher> no i havent
[23:58:25] <nachtkriecher> bam
[23:58:30] <nachtkriecher> that worked
[23:58:31] <nachtkriecher> thanks
[23:58:53] <faraway> nachtkriecher: IE uses an element only as offset parent it position left and right are explicit set
[23:59:02] <nachtkriecher> ah
[23:59:04] <nachtkriecher> i see
[23:59:07] <faraway> nachtkriecher: eh left ant top sorry
[23:59:10] <nachtkriecher> good to know
[23:59:17] <nachtkriecher> thanks man! much obliged
