[00:04:44] <req-> Hi. I use jQuery UI tabs. They set a default style for content inside the tabs, for example links. I would like all my links to be the standard color that is on the users' browser, any idea on how to undo what the tabs set? I thought $('#tabs a').removeClass('ui-widget-content'); would work but it has no effect :&
[00:05:57] <req-> I would use !important to set a custom color, but I want it to be whatever the browser uses
[00:11:19] <prateekp_> https://gist.github.com/3205402  ... this is the code which gives functionality to one button and when i put this code in for loop but then this code gives functionality to last button only .... and if i write code like this  https://gist.github.com/3205408 it gives functionality to 2 buttons .... how can i write in way to give functionality to more buttons without rewriting code
[00:12:15] <NeoNmaNDK> How can i build one plugin there can be using like this $('#id').myObj( options );
[00:15:31] <ram> hai

[00:15:55] <Guest39572> h
[00:16:22] <Guest39572> hai
[00:17:07] <coldhead> great talking to you, Guest39572
[00:17:24] <NeoNmaNDK> coldhead: Thanks, i this is what i need :)
[00:20:52] <ninnypants> anyone here use superscrollorama?
[00:20:58] <Woet> no, you're the first user
[00:21:32] <ninnypants> Woet: I have my doubts about that ;)
[00:21:52] <Woet> then it might be time to ask your actual question rather than looking for topic experts
[00:24:05] <phonebook_> whoa now
[00:24:26] <phonebook_> we are all friends here
[00:24:28] <tw2113> yo ninnypants  :P
[00:24:40] <ninnypants> I'm working with it to set up some simple swipe animations, but on the rewind it doesn't go back to the the start point
[00:24:57] <ninnypants> it stops about 30px before the start point
[00:25:08] <ninnypants> http://bss.bigswing.us/example/
[00:25:21] <phonebook_> not like philossophy were we argue over nonsense and just boot ppl cause we are wrong... no... this is a logc channel where you actually have to be right and cannot win by making shit up or telling a lie
[00:25:41] <coldhead> THAT'S A LIE, PHONEBOOK_
[00:25:47] <coldhead> IF I HAD OPS I WOULD KICK YOU
[00:25:47] <coldhead> etc
[00:25:53] <phonebook_> youre a lie! *CRIES
[00:25:55] <coldhead> sorry that wasn't very convincing
[00:26:04] <coldhead> its my first day in #jQuery
[00:26:14] <blackspotwiggins> you can totally win by making shit up
[00:26:16] * tw2113 is the pope
[00:26:23] <shell0x> ^hi
[00:26:38] <shell0x> how would you post the content of a dynamic html table?
[00:26:44] * coldhead averts his gaze from the pontiff
[00:27:33] <blackspotwiggins> shell0x, $.post("/dev/null", { tables: $("table").html() }) // lol wat am i doing
[00:29:15] <shell0x> blackspotwiggins: how would you do this if you want to post the whole form at a time?
[00:29:37] <shell0x> just add an input field with the content?
[00:30:01] <blackspotwiggins> shell0x, you asked about a table
[00:30:26] <blackspotwiggins> generally setting the method to "post" on a form works
[00:33:15] <shell0x> blackspotwiggins: i did this
[00:33:31] <shell0x> but it seems to ignore the table
[00:33:57] <phonebook_> what is the server language?
[00:34:23] <shell0x> ruby
[00:34:28] <shell0x> i use sinatra for the backend
[00:34:50] <phonebook_> is it metaphysical PHP or jsp... if so ust move to san fransisco and start blowing your own dick... no one can help you here
[00:36:14] <phonebook_> its funny actually because i was having the same problem earlier http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11714019/asp-net-hello-world-ajax-post
[00:37:45] <blackspotwiggins> shell0x, <table> is not supposed to be posted
[00:37:49] <blackspotwiggins> ajax or not
[00:40:08] <shell0x> blackspotwiggins: hmm, thanks
[00:42:54] <crooksey> Hi, currently I have a drag and drop feature working as per the jquery docs (my code http://dpaste.com/777864/) I this works, but I want the items once dragged to be in a fixed position. Can I use drag and drop with tables, then add then when an item is dropped into a table, force it to the bottom row?
[00:48:17] <phonebook_> ive been wrong before but that looks like a homework question
[00:48:30] <phonebook_> you cant ghetto down to the last row with selectors and finds?
[00:50:07] <coldhead> sure, crooksey, in the droppable() stop handler you can use append() to fang it onto the end of the table
[00:50:59] <crooksey> phonebook_: lol not a homework question. Im a python dev (as you can see from my templates) and have been asked to attempt some frontend stuff for a job, just seeing if I can get round it
[00:51:17] <phonebook_> thats cool sry
[00:51:32] <phonebook_> but getting to the last row on drop should be easy in jquery
[00:51:51] <crooksey> No worries, bet you get a lot though, think my homework was all in delphi/pascal
[00:52:21] <phonebook_> i do it like this
[00:52:24] <coldhead> i wish there were more people who had jQuery for homework
[00:52:25] <crooksey> Yea, thanks, once its then in the table, I then need to be able to re-order it, but that part I think I have mastered
[00:52:36] <coldhead> the education system is so HTML4
[00:52:41] <coldhead> XHTML1
[00:52:42] <coldhead> etc
[00:52:48] <phonebook_> ondrop... or whatever $(this).css("border", 5px solid red");
[00:53:09] <crooksey> Yea, good plan
[00:53:20] <phonebook_> and then do .find(li:last) or whatever to get what i want
[00:53:28] <phonebook_> .remove
[00:53:30] <phonebook_> whatever
[00:54:06] <crooksey> coldhead: when I was in COLLEGE I was being taught dreamweaver and html basic elemenets, when I had allready had my own rails framework, was quite hilarious really
[00:54:19] <crooksey> ^ecommerce
[00:54:29] <crooksey> phonebook_: yea thanks
[00:54:34] <phonebook_> sure
[00:55:00] <phonebook_> ..
[00:55:02] <coldhead> that's pretty depressing, crooksey
[00:55:18] <coldhead> this is why it's better to study pure math or literature or something
[00:55:31] <coldhead> etruscan erotic art
[00:55:41] <phonebook_> y?
[00:56:06] <crooksey> Ha, I left after 3 weeks when I could allready do everything on the course, walked into a job with a high salary and no schooling debts
[00:56:26] <coldhead> so you can actually learn stuff in college, instead of wasting time on html lectures when you already have a bunch of rails sites
[00:56:52] <coldhead> crooksey: the downside is you didn't study etruscan erotic art
[00:57:02] <coldhead> well you can always do that later
[00:58:04] <linelevel> Hi, is there any way for me to specify that any link clicked in an iframe opens in the parent? Both the iframe and parent contain pages at my domain.
[00:58:34] <phonebook_> yes
[00:58:49] <phonebook_> you need to target based on the browser
[00:58:59] <phonebook_> sec...
[01:02:22] <blackspotwiggins> coldhead, link me to some of that etruscan art pls
[01:02:40] <phonebook_> nm
[01:02:52] <phonebook_> that stack overflow acount of mine was deleted
[01:02:55] <phonebook_> but yes
[01:02:57] <phonebook_> basically
[01:03:10] <blackspotwiggins> linelevel, target="parent"? just guessing
[01:03:18] <coldhead> blackspotwiggins: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Etruscan_erotic_art
[01:03:36] <phonebook_> you get the iframe and go down to document element or whatever... and then you can jquery to "a" .live..
[01:03:53] <phonebook_> which is trailer trash code
[01:04:04] <phonebook_> but you can make it better once you have reemed out a pth
[01:04:07] <phonebook_> path
[01:04:24] <phonebook_> just never let stack overflow see it or you will get a -15
[01:04:44] <blackspotwiggins> -15.. what?
[01:04:48] <blackspotwiggins> internet points?
[01:05:07] <phonebook_> right... that and they will all make fun of you
[01:05:11] <linelevel> blackspotwiggins: I should have clarified: I could write some js to go through every link every time an AJAX call finishes and modify all the `a[href]` elements it finds to contain `target="_parent"` attributes... I was just hoping there was a better way, like something I could do in a `$(document).on('a[href]', ...)` callback.
[01:05:44] <blackspotwiggins> linelevel, yea there is
[01:05:46] <zulu-gula> how to animate element depending on cursor position? for example: if cursor is 100px from left side I want to animate background 100px per second moving  left. If it's 200px from right side I want to animate background moving 50px per second to right
[01:05:51] <phonebook_> they turn your own question against you!!! they will make your question say.... i love sucking dicks...
[01:05:52] <blackspotwiggins> capture the events from parent
[01:06:08] <phonebook_> and then the is your question because they are op and can make your question what they want
[01:07:18] <jmoney> but that is a correct and valid question
[01:07:43] <phonebook_> not really
[01:07:53] <linelevel> phonebook_: Why is it "trailer trash code"?
[01:07:53] <linelevel> other than the fact that .live() is deprecated?
[01:08:38] <blackspotwiggins> people abusing .live() is bad, nothing wrong with it
[01:08:48] <M1k1> guys how can set charset with jquery please?
[01:08:49] <blackspotwiggins> now they are forced to scope things better
[01:09:11] <phonebook_> trailer trash code because it ignores basic data strutures and algorithms and just runs the same crap over to get any result.... its easy... its ineffecient... it gets it done without giving any care about what is happening.... its poorly written
[01:10:06] <linelevel> blackspotwiggins: so what can I do within the .on() callback to make it open in the parent?
[01:11:13] <t432> this makes sense right? e.g. usage of selector() to append stuff.... $("#statusWrapper ").children.children.eq[0].append(data);
[01:12:29] <BinaryKitten> t432 except its eq(0)
[01:12:38] <coldhead> and children()
[01:13:07] <coldhead> may a thousand nodes be needlessly returned
[01:13:56] <foucist> won't you think of the children?
[01:15:12] <blackspotwiggins> linelevel, gonna try to fiddle it
[01:15:19] <blackspotwiggins> im not 100% on using jquery across iframes
[01:15:42] <phonebook_> ive done this
[01:15:49] <phonebook_> jquery is a good way to go
[01:15:55] <phonebook_> it is
[01:15:58] <phonebook_>  its like this...
[01:16:26] <linelevel> phonebook_: So if binding $(document).on('a[href]') is bad code, what would be a better approach?
[01:17:19] <phonebook_> $.each($("iframe"), function() {$(this)[0].onload = function() { alert("hello world"????}});
[01:17:52] <phonebook_> use
[01:18:43] <phonebook_> $("[href]").on("click" function() { alert ("abc");} );
[01:19:03] <blackspotwiggins> phonebook_, that assumes the iframe has jquery as well
[01:19:28] <phonebook_> does it? ... seriously
[01:19:39] <phonebook_> i thought it drilled down from the master level
[01:19:54] <M1k1> how can set charset for js?
[01:19:59] <jmoney> would that not traverse all nodes looking for href attributes rather than just anchor nodes
[01:20:14] <BinaryKitten> phonebook_ is the content of the iframe on the same domain?
[01:20:42] <jmoney> a[href] ensuring it does a getelementsbytagname first to narrow down the linear scan
[01:20:55] <phonebook_> hold on pls... i have to pou more vodka
[01:21:05] <stenno|work> :|
[01:21:08] <jmoney> sunday night insomnia
[01:21:09] <phonebook_> dont worry aout me being at work in 3 hours... not a problem
[01:21:12] <phonebook_> NOT A PROBLEM!!!!
[01:21:19] * stenno|work awaits jquery 2.0 with excitement
[01:21:23] <jmoney> im on my first beer personally
[01:21:24] <phonebook_> so sad in so many ways
[01:21:41] <BinaryKitten> stenno|work jQuery 2 scares me slightly.
[01:21:50] <gabriel1> phonebook_: from eastern europe?
[01:22:00] <stenno|work> BinaryKitten, i heard awesome things about it, especially relating to IE6-8 :D
[01:22:10] <BinaryKitten> stenno|work that's what scares me
[01:22:22] <stenno|work> its the right thing to do
[01:22:25] <BinaryKitten> i know how my clients think, and they won't care
[01:22:28] <stenno|work> those are anachronism
[01:22:32] <stenno|work> (sp?)
[01:22:52] <phonebook_> anarchists!!
[01:23:01] <jmoney> arachnids!
[01:23:13] <BinaryKitten> phonebook_ also as a note .. don't ever do $(this)[0]
[01:23:16] <phonebook_> the only good bug is a dead bug!
[01:23:29] <BinaryKitten> $(this)[0] === this
[01:23:42] <BinaryKitten> so $(this)[0] is pointless overhead
[01:23:51] <stenno|work> if the framework developers and the web developers work together against the customers, we might get rid of IE6-8
[01:24:01] <stenno|work> wtf why did jquery 1.7 even support IE6
[01:24:13] <BinaryKitten> stenno|work that's a nice dream you have
[01:24:18] <BinaryKitten> shame about reality
[01:24:28] <stenno|work> fair enough :)
[01:24:35] <BinaryKitten> i don't mind it being removed
[01:24:46] <BinaryKitten> i just hope they release the code into a compatability layer
[01:25:07] <stenno|work> i guess that jquery 1.7 will get long-term support like XP or ruby 1.8 ?
[01:25:20] <stenno|work> and with support i mean, non-deprecation
[01:25:44] <linelevel> phonebook_: the iframe has jQuery anyway, so I don't have a problem with that. But the problem with $('a[href').on(...) is that it assumes all the <a>s already exist, and doesn't cover the new ones that will get added via AJAX. My way: $(document).on('click', 'a[href]', ...) will work for future <a>s as well.
[01:25:58] <phonebook_> undeerstood a little better binary
[01:26:11] <phonebook_> never have taken the 15 mintues to get that part
[01:26:28] <phonebook_> i prefer doig it 6 million times
[01:27:02] <phonebook_> okay i want to kow now
[01:27:15] <jmoney> its amazing what constructs a lil organizational cut n paste mentality can give birth to
[01:27:38] <phonebook_> .on("click", function() { /*THIS!?!??! *? }
[01:27:47] <phonebook_> amazing magic
[01:27:57] <linelevel> stenno|work: Earlier this year I added IE8 to my list of browsers that I charge extra to support. Usually once a client sees a price tag next to it it doesn't seem so important to have support for anymore...
[01:28:13] <stenno|work> yeah thats a good attitude
[01:30:13] <phonebook_> i see
[01:30:27] <linelevel> phonebook_: I'm still not sure what to do in my callback though.. so I've intercepted the <a> element being clicked.. how do I cause that to open in the parent? I guess I could do    $(this).attr('target', '_parent'); return true;    but can I open the link via js instead of passing control back to the default action?
[01:30:40] <phonebook_> so i have to break through and work from 1am to 5am to be down with this crowd
[01:30:43] <phonebook_> okay.... okay
[01:30:47] <phonebook_> thats cool
[01:31:07] <phonebook_> cowards
[01:31:07] <blackspotwiggins> linelevel, you can set the window.location on parent
[01:31:33] <linelevel> blackspotwiggins: ah, good point. That's what I should do.
[01:32:55] <linelevel> though I suppose this will interfere with other <a>s on that page that have their own click events. Maybe setting their target and passing on control is the best option.
[01:33:41] <phonebook_> you can namespace them with "click.mya"
[01:33:48] <phonebook_> on off
[01:34:30] <blackspotwiggins> linelevel, maybe
[01:34:31] <EnginA>  hmm, .draggable() options, handle and cancel does not work as the sample on my code. any common pitfalls. ?
[01:34:32] <blackspotwiggins> then again
[01:34:38] <blackspotwiggins> you are binding on load right?
[01:34:44] <blackspotwiggins> it means your handler runs the last
[01:35:09] <linelevel> phonebook_: I'm actually thinking of going a completely non-js route and just putting   <base target="_parent" />    at the top of the iframe'd page
[01:35:21] <blackspotwiggins> that might work as well
[01:35:35] <phonebook_> non-js?
[01:35:47] <phonebook_> im confused
[01:38:34] <phonebook_> you can drill down to onload of nested iframes and individual elements
[01:38:43] <phonebook_> its like 6 lines of jquery
[01:40:03] <phonebook_> ....i dont have the code of course.... it might be illegal for me to post... in fact i shoul dprobably be asleep right now..... my mind should probably be legally required to be sleeping... what a compliment....except....
[01:40:56] <phonebook_> its 4:40 am and this has never been more boring
[01:41:06] <fly-> Hello,
[01:41:23] <fly-> is there a way to detect the height of the contents of an iframe with jquery/js?
[01:41:39] <phonebook_> yes
[01:41:58] <phonebook_> what web browser do you use?
[01:42:01] <fly-> chrome
[01:42:26] <phonebook_> start using safari... both webkit... safari is best for dev
[01:42:31] <fly-> ah k
[01:42:38] <phonebook_> im seriou
[01:42:59] <fly-> well, i do have safari... i'm on a mac
[01:43:00] <phonebook_> do this...
[01:43:27] <Whirl3d> gimme a break. It's a matter of preference. Safari sucks ass in my book. I prefer Chrome hands down
[01:43:46] <phonebook_> in SAFARI.... jquery get your igrame... get the documentelement...get the body... whatever
[01:44:02] <ge2x> Hey people! I have some HTML fetched via $.ajax and can be reloaded anytime by the user and I want it parsed by $.each everytime. How do I do that?
[01:44:32] <jmoney> i like webkit devtools but it does some annoying shit right now
[01:44:49] <phonebook_> then
[01:44:51] <jmoney> often errors propagated out of the call stack don't list the stack trace with links in the console
[01:45:03] <phonebook_> once you get the body or the div
[01:45:10] <phonebook_> use .height
[01:45:15] <phonebook_> the end... you win
[01:45:18] <jmoney> it just gives you the error object with allo the useful properties hidden behind accessors
[01:45:25] <phonebook_> ++
[01:45:25] <jmoney> this is a recent development i have filed a bug
[01:45:44] <fly-> thank phonebook_
[01:45:47] <fly-> i'll take a look
[01:45:50] <phonebook_> wait
[01:45:53] <phonebook_> wait wait
[01:45:55] <fly-> lolk
[01:46:09] <phonebook_> ive been thanked 3 times this night for giving shit advice
[01:46:14] <fly-> hahaha
[01:46:23] <phonebook_> you dont hae to thank me if you dont think my advice is good
[01:46:24] <fly-> well i mean, it sounds reasonable
[01:46:35] <phonebook_> its okay to just say it
[01:46:41] <fly-> say what
[01:46:53] <fly-> you're confirming what i thought i needed to do
[01:46:59] <fly-> if it's wrong, i'll come back and yell at you :)
[01:47:11] <phonebook_> rock on
[01:48:31] <fly-> is there like a dev console or something for safari
[01:48:46] <phonebook_> safari is best
[01:48:58] <fly-> nvm found it
[01:49:14] <phonebook_> good couldnt remember it
[01:49:15] <phonebook_> but
[01:49:24] <phonebook_> they have disable caches
[01:49:27] <phonebook_> and on off js
[01:49:36] <phonebook_> etc
[01:50:36] <fly-> phonebook_: looks like .css('height') is more relevant here
[01:50:59] <fly-> just because it returns the #px as opposed to just #
[01:51:35] <phonebook_> yep, thats good
[01:54:21] <boulet101010> Hi, i just saw someone writing "new Image" to create an img object, i was wondering if kind of "new Media" would exist to create an audio or video object.
[01:55:54] <Whirl3d> so, I thought that $.load() would allow you to load a page fragment if you included the selector in the url. For example target.load("http://mydomain/index.html .sectionContent", function (data) {}); should load only the contents of the div with class='sectionContent'
[01:56:35] <ramkamx> hello, how can i define a callback inside of an object's method, and have the callback populate a property of the object ... ? http://jsfiddle.net/vdw67/
[01:57:32] <ge2x> could somebody please share, how can I make an event that is triggered when there is any ajax request?
[01:57:38] <ge2x> what should be the target?
[01:59:35] <Whirl3d> ramkamx, what are you actually trying to do with $.get('http:/....
[02:00:05] <ramkamx> Whirl3d: actually i'm trying to use webdatabases, but the logic is the same
[02:00:33] <ramkamx> used $.get() to simplify the code in jsfiddle
[02:01:22] <Whirl3d> not familiar with "webdatabases". Is there a reason why you can't use $.ajax()
[02:01:52] <Whirl3d> I don't know the shortcut syntax is all.
[02:02:25] <ramkamx> Whirl3d: if you want, doesn't matter, let's use $.ajax for the purpose of the example
[02:02:53] <Whirl3d> then you want the success handler callback to populate a field in the object of xClass
[02:03:30] <ramkamx> Whirl3d: the point is how can i build a callback function on the fly, that edits the object's properties, and handover this function to another function (like $.ajax)
[02:04:02] <ramkamx> Whirl3d: the code i've put doesn't work, the context is lost
[02:04:20] <Whirl3d> gimme a second to see if I am understanding you...brb
[02:04:50] <gnarf> ramkamx: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy
[02:06:03] <gnarf> ramkamx: http://jsfiddle.net/vdw67/4/
[02:06:26] <ramkamx> gnarf, let me try on the full code, one sec
[02:07:38] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/vdw67/7/
[02:09:57] <ramkamx> gnarf: works, thanks. Is there any memory issues with proxy ? (i entend to use it heavily, maybe put it in workers)
[02:10:22] <gnarf> ramkamx: proxy creates a tiny function
[02:10:48] <ramkamx> gnarf: cheers
[02:11:09] <gnarf> ramkamx: it is a function that has like the scope object and the method in its scope
[02:11:25] <ramkamx> Whirl3d: tried to do var self = this - let me check if i missed something vs your code
[02:11:44] <Whirl3d> gnarf's is MUCH nicer.
[02:12:33] <ramkamx> Whirl3d: yeps, looks nicer :-) i need to understand better how scoping works though
[02:13:01] <ramkamx> "need" = would like to :-)
[02:14:06] <gnarf> ramkamx: scope is pretty damn simple
[02:14:58] <gnarf> ramkamx: each function gets it's own scope per execution, that scope includes any defined vars in the function, and its arguments
[02:15:22] <ramkamx> gnarf: but when you use "this" things gets a bit messier
[02:15:31] <gnarf> ramkamx: "this" is context, not scope
[02:15:46] <Whirl3d> so gnarf, why is it better to use proxy than it is to cache "this"
[02:15:58] <gnarf> although "context" is better than "scope"
[02:16:02] <gnarf> er sorry
[02:16:05] <gnarf> ^^^^
[02:16:06] <gnarf> better :)
[02:16:12] <gnarf> context is inside of the scope
[02:16:21] <gnarf> "this", "arguments", "vars"
[02:16:48] <blackspotwiggins> would it not be easier to use call/apply
[02:16:51] <blackspotwiggins> versus proxy?
[02:16:54] <gnarf> Whirl3d: caching "this" means that the function has to be defined inside of the scope, which if you use $.proxy it doesn't have to be
[02:17:02] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: thats what proxy does
[02:17:14] <blackspotwiggins> yea, seems like unnecessary wrapping
[02:17:29] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L743-768
[02:17:39] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: you still have to create a function to call it in a different scope
[02:17:41] <gnarf> regardless
[02:17:54] <gnarf> proxy is tiny and quick and returns that function for you automatically
[02:17:58] <gnarf> why not use it?
[02:18:16] <gnarf> if you have a "context" and the function, no point in using proxy
[02:18:37] <gnarf> but when you actually want to have a new function - use proxy
[02:18:58] <gnarf> or Function.prototype.bind() if you're developing for only good browsers ;)
[02:20:22] <gnarf> ramkamx: things don't get messy with "this" - it lets you write functions that don't depend on being inside of a scope and can operate only on "this"
[02:20:51] <gnarf> ramkamx: knowing what "this" is in any particular context can be a little tricky, but jQuery makes it pretty simple
[02:21:19] <ramkamx> gnarf: sold. Do you have a good reference for this ("this")
[02:22:07] <gnarf> ramkamx: i hope you don't think the quotes have any special meaning
[02:22:26] <gnarf> ramkamx: this is the context the function is called in, simple
[02:22:57] <gnarf> event handlers are called in the context the event is bound to
[02:23:09] <gnarf> ajax handlers are called in the context of the jqXHR
[02:23:23] <gnarf> animation callbacks are called in the context of the element
[02:23:26] <ramkamx> gnarf: yes, but i don't understand why, when i tried to do var self = this, then define the callback based on self, it didn't work
[02:23:45] <gnarf> ramkamx: it works
[02:23:59] <gnarf> ramkamx: the nice thing about using this...
[02:25:18] <ramkamx> gnarf: i tried doing: var self = this; var callback = function() { var zself = self; zself.propertyName = 321; } i must have missed something
[02:25:24] <gnarf> you don't have to use crazy wrappers if you bind functions that you want in particular contexts;;;
[02:25:36] <gnarf> ramkamx: why zself, you can just edit self
[02:25:51] <gnarf> it works either way
[02:26:14] <ramkamx> gnarf: because of my poor knowledge of contexts & scoping :-)
[02:26:44] <Whirl3d> ramkamx, could it be as simple as you didn't instantiate your class correctly by adding () at the end?
[02:26:54] <Whirl3d> var x=new xclass();
[02:27:03] <gnarf> ramkamx: pointless - scope is scope, and Whirl3d the () are optional
[02:27:14] <Whirl3d> that's why I asked. Thanks.
[02:27:15] <ramkamx> Whirl3d: scared me :-)
[02:27:18] <Whirl3d> lol
[02:27:33] <gnarf> ramkamx: functions = scope
[02:28:02] <gnarf> ramkamx: anything inside a function can reference variables / arguments defined in that functions scope
[02:28:57] <ramkamx> gnarf: right, it works too. I don't know what i did before. must have done it too late. anyway, discovered $.proxy() which is much nicer to write the code
[02:30:48] <ramkamx> gnarf: is jquery working on functions for webdatabase handling ?
[02:31:03] <gnarf> ramkamx: the nice thing about using proxy is that the "callback" can be defined outside of the function too - whereas if you're doing the var self = this; method, anything has to be inside the function that defines var self;
[02:31:20] <gnarf> ramkamx: wtf is "webdatabase" and why would jQuery work on anything related to it..
[02:31:53] <ramkamx> gnarf: a client side sqlite lite database
[02:32:05] <gnarf> ramkamx: oh, i'm sure theres already a good plugin for that
[02:32:09] <gnarf> and or library
[02:32:36] <gnarf> btw, the Web SQL Database is deprecated
[02:33:12] <ramkamx> gnarf: it's quite annoying to use, especially for double commits, because of the callback system (has to deal with 2 callbacks, it's a mess to code)
[02:33:32] <gnarf> IndexedDB is the newer stuff i think
[02:34:10] <ramkamx> gnarf: right
[02:34:11] <blackspotwiggins> with indexeddb, function.prototype.bind would be also quite safe, i think
[02:34:13] <blackspotwiggins> :)
[02:34:57] <gnarf> http://caniuse.com/indexeddb
[02:35:24] <gnarf> http://caniuse.com/#feat=sql-storage
[02:35:40] <gnarf> sorry http://caniuse.com/sql-storage ;)
[02:35:41] <ramkamx> gnarf: cheers for the link. i'm coding for safari ...
[02:36:11] <blackspotwiggins> ahh
[02:36:23] <blackspotwiggins> chrome 7-10 has bind() but no indexeddb
[02:36:56] <blackspotwiggins> well, people using old versions of chrome are a pretty lonely bunch
[02:37:14] <ramkamx> blackspotwiggins: lol. i guess that smartphone manufacturer's arent too happy with hybrid apps potential
[02:37:48] <freazy> hi, why is that not working : $('#content').load(url + ' #content', function(data){
[02:37:52] <freazy> ?
[02:38:19] <gnarf> freazy: define "not working"
[02:38:20] <blackspotwiggins> ramkamx, i fail to see the connection?
[02:38:21] <freazy> and how i can get only the div #content out of data?
[02:38:46] <freazy> i loads me the whole page not only the div #content which i define
[02:39:07] <freazy> without the function all works fine
[02:39:09] <NodeX> unwrap it
[02:39:16] <NodeX> and make sure #content exists
[02:39:23] <NodeX> (in the response)
[02:39:27] <gnarf> freazy: i have always disliked the "jQuery.fn.load"
[02:39:49] <freazy> #content exists what u mean with unwrap?
[02:40:01] <NodeX> ?unwrap
[02:40:11] <ramkamx> blackspotwiggins: recent iOS's are not very friendly with localstorage and client side databases, especially when you use them in hybrid apps (phonegap). localstorage isn't persistent, webdatabase are no longer backuped (you loose the data if you restore).
[02:40:19] <ramkamx> Whirl3d, gnarf, blackspotwiggins : thanks for helping
[02:40:23] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[02:40:28] <gnarf> $.ajax({ url: url, dataType: "html" }).done(function( data ) { $("#content").html( $( data ).find( "#content" ).contents() ) }
[02:40:48] <freazy> ok thx :) that what i need: )
[02:41:00] <NodeX> $(this).children(':first').unwrap(); <--- just add that
[02:41:16] <NodeX> (in your return function)
[02:42:09] <blackspotwiggins> ramkamx, apple is a special case, but LG or nokia or huawei dont make the OS or the browser.. so manufacturers might not be the best word
[02:42:29] <freazy> but isnt it possible only to load a div, because so i use traffic which i dont need?
[02:42:55] <ramkamx> blackspotwiggins: yes, my wording wasn't clear
[02:44:11] <ramkamx> thanks everyone !
[02:47:12] <NodeX> freazy : it still calls the whole page - jquery simply parses out the bits you need
[02:47:34] <devslash> hey guys i have this query code: http://pastebin.com/j4EhEWs1 this is just the skeleton. the function ended: function (event)  gets called when a song finishes playing i put an alert in there to make sure it does get called. but is playtrack() out of scope for the ended function ?
[02:47:41] <NodeX> the load still goes over the wire minus any javascript / image rendering
[02:48:58] <devslash> NodeX: do you know about the scope of javascript functions ?
[02:49:07] <t432> script completely ignores the divs and places content below the divs in html (lined 1-8 are divs as formated in html page) - http://pastebin.com/qCLngYcz
[02:49:19] <NodeX> yes I do, your scope is messed up
[02:49:45] <gnarf> devslash: of course that isn't in scope
[02:49:58] <NodeX> you have 3 x "}" that should be at the end
[02:50:17] <devslash> i know
[02:50:40] <gnarf> devslash: define a vairable in the outer scope, and assign a function to it if you really have to make the "playtrack" function inside the jqPlayer ready callback
[02:50:52] <gnarf> just make sure to check if ( playtrack ) { playtrack(1); }
[02:50:59] <gnarf> that
[02:51:00] <gnarf> or
[02:51:06] <gnarf> you can var playtrack = jQuery.noop;
[02:51:18] <devslash> wtf is that
[02:51:23] <devslash> jQuery.noop
[02:51:29] <gnarf> then inside the jqplayer ready callback, playtrack = function( tracknumber ) { .... };
[02:51:36] <gnarf> devslash: jQuery.noop = function(){};
[02:51:55] <NodeX> http://pastebin.com/WrGrf7Ck <-- maybe that will help Dev0n
[02:52:00] <devslash> what if i move play track to right after $(document).ready(function() {
[02:52:04] <NodeX> devslash **
[02:52:09] <devslash> would that be an easier resolution
[02:52:20] <gnarf> devslash: if it doesn't require anything from inside, of course
[02:52:24] <devslash> yea
[02:52:32] <gnarf> i was assuming it was defined inside because it needed something from the "ready" context
[02:52:47] <gnarf> otherwise why the hell would you define it there?
[02:53:34] <t432> anyone?
[02:55:51] <Altreus> <select> boxes appear to be causing great issue with the mouseleave event. http://jsfiddle.net/cEhkU/
[02:56:03] <Altreus> am i doing it wrong?
[02:56:34] <shell0x> whats the easiest to get the values of all tds in the table rows as json?
[02:57:19] <NodeX> Altreus : what issue?
[02:58:15] <Altreus> NodeX: it triggers mouseleave when I click the select box, even though the mouse, select box and options pane are all within the div
[02:58:33] <Altreus> once that happens it triggers both enter and leave every time I move the mouse
[02:58:40] <Altreus> even if I unfocus the box
[02:58:57] <NodeX> never debug with alert() .. it hangs the engine
[02:59:38] <Altreus> fair enough
[02:59:52] <NodeX> it works completely fine and as expected
[03:00:05] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/cEhkU/1/
[03:01:00] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:01:04] <Altreus> doesn't for me: http://jsfiddle.net/cEhkU/2/
[03:01:13] <Altreus> Whenever I click on the select box it appends "out"
[03:01:24] <Altreus> even though the mouse hasn't moved
[03:01:27] <jomofcw> Is there a way to know the real size (out of any height witdh CSS/HTML defined) of an image, please ?
[03:01:48] <Altreus> NodeX: what browser are you using?
[03:01:52] * Altreus tries ff
[03:01:56] <NodeX> that's because it loses focus
[03:02:39] <Altreus> That's not what I understand "when the mouse leaves the element" to mean
[03:02:50] <Altreus> Focus is an orthogonal concept to where the mouse is
[03:03:50] <majd> Hey #jquery - i know the :lt and :gt selectors, i was wondering if there was a way to get gte and lte (greater than or equal to, less than or equal to) without subtracting 1 from the index
[03:07:04] <NodeX> Altreus : I dont know what your big words mean sorry
[03:07:25] <NodeX> what I do know is mouseout is triggered when the mose moves away from an element OR when it loses focus
[03:10:17] <Altreus> NodeX: The docs don't say this. Also the behaviour is different across browsers.
[03:10:26] <joeyjones> any ideas on a plugin/etc for add/remove table columns/rows of a form table?
[03:11:27] <NodeX> :)
[03:11:43] <NodeX> to which docs are you reffering ? .. jquery ?
[03:11:54] <Altreus> http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/  these ones
[03:11:59] <Altreus> doesn't mention focus at all
[03:12:09] <bastetmilo> hi, I have small problem - I have few input text fields and very long jquery script (but it's not mine) - and every time I try to write something in this fileds page jumps to top. What can possibly make that?
[03:12:31] <NodeX> jquery simply EXTENDS javascript events
[03:12:59] <bastetmilo> It is not happening when I click fiedls
[03:13:06] <bastetmilo> fields*
[03:13:43] <NodeX> in the case of mouseleave it would seem to simulate the event
[03:14:12] <NodeX> perhaps you want "mouseout"
[03:14:26] <Altreus> not really
[03:14:35] <Altreus> Then it would trigger when I point at the select box
[03:15:02] <blackspotwiggins> mouseenter and -leave are native only on IE
[03:15:06] <NodeX> then what exactly is the problem?>
[03:15:10] <blackspotwiggins> for the rest, jquery hacks it together
[03:15:55] <joeyjones> bastetmilo: it would be an event call, i forget the anme, that's sent when the value changes
[03:15:59] <jomofcw> Is there a way to know the real size (out of any height witdh CSS/HTML defined) of an image, please ?
[03:16:02] <joeyjones> bastetmilo: pastebin the script
[03:17:39] <joeyjones> bastetmilo: and if the script is running in an accessible location a link would help as well
[03:18:40] <Altreus> NodeX: I am using mouseleave to detect when to close a menu on my page. The menu has a <select> in it. The menu - <select> and all - disappears when the user interacts with the <select>. This is clearly incorrect, since the mouse has not left the menu
[03:19:03] <NodeX> it has LOST focus though so is intended behaviour
[03:19:05] <bastetmilo> joeyjones: http://inmed.brandsites.pl/konfigurator/ - box before the last, named "osoba zamawiajaca"
[03:19:10] <Altreus> it is NOT intended behaviour
[03:19:17] <berndj> i have stacking trouble: http://mph.bpj-code.co.za/products.php?category=186  When my client (using IE) goes there, the superfish menu goes under the DataTable, and clicking on any of the items brings up a dialog but the arrow of the "show 10 items" stays on top of the dialog. what's up? and how to fix?
[03:19:20] <NodeX> not by YOU no .. but it is by jQuery
[03:19:22] <Altreus> Focus has nothing to do with mouse enter/mouse leave
[03:19:34] <NodeX> Altreus : it does when it's simulated
[03:19:46] <Altreus> Two problems with what you are saying
[03:19:53] <NodeX> then go use another lubrary
[03:19:53] <Altreus> 1) it is a completely irrelevant concept
[03:19:59] <Altreus> 2) It doesn't do it in firefox
[03:19:59] <NodeX> library*
[03:20:14] <NodeX> or fix your script to not listen like that
[03:20:23] <bastetmilo> joeyjones: please don't comment that - I didn't write that script I just trying to get things work :)
[03:20:50] <Altreus> NodeX: Alright, then why doesn't an <input> do it?
[03:21:04] <NodeX> because an input is a self closing tag with no CHILDREN
[03:21:11] <Altreus> You said focus
[03:21:19] <NodeX> omg
[03:21:20] <Altreus> What does the DOM have to do with focus?
[03:21:29] <NodeX> what do you think happens when you click a select box ?
[03:21:48] <NodeX> it focuses on the first <option> or child
[03:21:50] <Altreus> Apparently different things in different browsers
[03:22:01] <NodeX> and you're surprised by this?
[03:22:02] <Altreus> What if it has no options?
[03:22:32] <NodeX> how the hell should I know, what is the point of a select box with no options
[03:22:42] <Altreus> Now you're just getting cross
[03:22:47] <NodeX> not at all
[03:22:55] <NodeX> I dont ask silly edge case questions
[03:23:06] <Altreus> It's not that it's an edge-case question
[03:23:20] <Altreus> it's more that every answer you've given me so far has been testable
[03:23:23] <NodeX> a select box with no options is not edge case ? lololol
[03:23:26] <Altreus> And I've tested them and found them to be wrong
[03:23:30] <NodeX> then go use another library
[03:23:52] <Altreus> You said that it was focus causing the behaviour. So I changed to a different element and determined that it is not focus
[03:23:54] <NodeX> this sense of entitlement with people using open-source libs is breath taking
[03:24:00] <Altreus> Then you said that it was children causing the behaviour
[03:24:09] <Altreus> So I removed the children and found that not to be the case
[03:24:12] <NodeX> NO, I said it's focus and I stand by that
[03:24:28] <Altreus> But that's not true because a normal <input> can take focus without exhibiting the behaviour
[03:24:45] <Altreus> unless you mean something by focus that I don't
[03:25:06] <NodeX> obviously I do
[03:25:12] <Altreus> And even if you're right about that it isn't true of firefox
[03:25:28] <Altreus> firefox doesn't do it until the mouse pointer leaves the select box and moves into the options list
[03:25:33] <joeyjones> bastetmilo: are you able to safely edit the js files?
[03:25:33] <Altreus> which is more reasonable
[03:25:39] <Altreus> albeit slightly pesky
[03:25:42] <NodeX> *yawn*
[03:25:54] <Altreus> look, if you're not prepareed to help, don't
[03:26:03] <Altreus> And if you're not prepared to accept improvements, that's fine
[03:26:06] <NodeX> if(event.target=='select') { .... return false
[03:26:17] <NodeX> improvements .. wht are you on about?
[03:26:18] <astropirate> Anyone looking for a freelance jQuery/Node.js/C++ developer? :) PM me please
[03:26:54] <jamesdotnet> Altreus, could you repeat your original question/issue? I just joined but this sounds interesting whatever it is.
[03:26:58] <Altreus> It seems to me that it would be an improvement if things didn't disappear unexpectedly just because of some arbitrary low-level causes and effects that no one writing jQuery wants to hear about
[03:27:03] <Altreus> jamesdotnet: http://jsfiddle.net/cEhkU/2/
[03:27:19] <Altreus> jamesdotnet: When you interact with a select box, it triggers the mouseleave event on a parent
[03:27:31] <Altreus> jamesdotnet: The behaviour varies by browser but in chromium it triggers immediately
[03:27:33] <bastetmilo> joeyjones: yes
[03:27:58] <Altreus> jamesdotnet: and in Firefox it triggers when the mouse moves into the options, which at least seems like it has a reason
[03:28:50] <NodeX> OMG. for the fifth time. it's caused by focus being lost on the simulation because focus is lost. Each browser behaves differently when a seletc box is clicked. END OF STORY
[03:29:17] <Altreus> Will you stop talking about focus
[03:29:21] <NodeX> to fix ... check the element that triggered the change, match a seletct box, return false
[03:29:29] <Altreus> I've already shown that focus is irrelevant, both empirically and logically
[03:29:51] <Altreus> mouse doesn't move -> mouse cannot possibly have left
[03:29:57] <NodeX> Kid. the behaviour is not going to change
[03:30:10] <NodeX> so either fix your script to look for it or use a different library
[03:30:12] <Altreus> Derogatorily calling me kid. Nice move
[03:30:20] <NodeX> big words lol
[03:30:38] <Altreus> Why are you being rude?
[03:31:05] <Altreus> Do you disagree that unexpected behaviour that is inconsistent across browsers constitutes a bug?
[03:31:09] <NodeX> who is being rude ?... you wont listen or accept a fix for your script, you seem hell bent on arguing somehting that's irrelevant and not going to change
[03:31:23] <Altreus> Do you in fact disagree that undocumented differences across browsers constitutes at least a doc bug?
[03:31:36] <NodeX> yes I do
[03:31:41] <Altreus> Then we will never settle this
[03:31:47] <NodeX> because they are BROWSER flaws not jquery flaws
[03:32:03] <NodeX> when you realise that you will be able to fix your script and move on
[03:32:15] <Altreus> So you disagree that one of the purposes of jquery is to provide browser-independent, consistent behaviour?
[03:32:27] <NodeX> jquery is NOT the cure for every inconsitency in every browser
[03:33:15] <Altreus> That's fair
[03:33:26] <Altreus> But mouseleave is implemented by jquery in both chromium and firefox
[03:33:56] <NodeX> no it's SIMMULATED
[03:34:00] <Altreus> right
[03:34:04] <NodeX> -M
[03:34:08] <Altreus> those words are not mutually exclusive
[03:34:48] <NodeX> omg. jquery fires the simulation for the browsers - what they do with it is not down to jquery
[03:35:03] <NodeX> i/e how they handle the information sent to them
[03:35:19] <NodeX> if you dont understand that then you will never fix your issue
[03:35:24] <NodeX> </done>
[03:35:52] <Altreus> er.
[03:36:03] <Altreus> You're right, I don't understand that
[03:36:08] <Altreus> But I'm willing to learn
[03:36:24] <user1980> ignore me
[03:37:15] <NodeX> if you want to fix your script. trap the event. look for the element that triggered it - normaly $(this); .. check it's "type" / node name, if it's "select" then return false (dont close)
[03:37:31] <Altreus> I understand the fix
[03:37:31] <joeyjones> bastetmilo: i think it might be a segment in your config.js, try removing it and testing to see if it gets rid of it.  otherwise remove one at a time until it stops
[03:37:56] <Altreus> I don't understand what you mean by "jquery fires the simulation for the browsers" -- surely this simulation is part of jq?
[03:38:06] <Altreus> otherwise it would be part of the browser
[03:38:25] <NodeX> you dont need to understand that part because you understanding it wont change your script
[03:38:45] <NodeX> if you want a deeper understanding of it then read the source
[03:39:00] <Altreus> so you're not prepared to teach?
[03:39:20] <Altreus> You chewed me out for not knowing something but won't help me know it?
[03:41:01] <NodeX> It's not my job to teach you the inner workings of an open source library
[03:41:08] <some_dude> harro fliends
[03:41:23] <Altreus> I didn't realise it was your job at all
[03:41:24] <bastetmilo> joeyjones: I know that "sits" in my config.js - but maybe you have idea what could be doing that? I'm not asking for exact function, but the mechanism that would do such a thing
[03:41:25] <some_dude> what's the best way to get multilingual support with jquery?
[03:41:28] <Altreus> You could've explained it by now :P
[03:42:01] <NodeX> I couldv'e yes but it's better for you to read the source and understand it yourself
[03:42:36] <bjensen> I have some weird js date picker behavior I'm trying to debug. I would like to start by removing refences to scripts. Can I do this within firebug in ff
[03:42:37] <bjensen> ?
[03:42:45] <joeyjones> bastetmilo: bastetmilo it would normally be a segment like $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, 0); but could be done in a ultitude of ways
[03:43:32] <joeyjones> the best wya to track it down imho is to figure out which .js file is causing it, and then look for functions called by click on the id, class, element, etc.
[03:43:35] <joeyjones> *way
[03:44:05] <bjensen> joeyjones:
[03:44:10] <bjensen> joeyjones: talking to me?
[03:44:22] <joeyjones> bjensen: not yet :)
[03:44:38] <joeyjones> bjensen: but that does apply really
[03:44:54] <joeyjones> just comment out or remove the .js links in the header
[03:45:06] <bjensen> joeyjones: right, but I am afreid its some weird side effect of some plugin so I was hoping I could unload a js file using firebug
[03:45:35] <bjensen> but does that also unload if a js object has been initialized?
[03:45:38] <joeyjones> bjensen: trying to remove with firebug wouldn't really work, as afaik actions are attached to elements on pageload
[03:45:53] <bjensen> yeah..
[03:46:03] <joeyjones> so just go through in the source :p
[03:47:25] <joeyjones> bjensen: and you could wind up with weird results from disabling through firebug
[03:47:46] <bjensen> yeah I won't try that I am just looking for the best way to debug
[03:49:22] <joeyjones> and i'm still trying to figure out a way to not have to code this myself...
[03:51:53] <jamesdotnet> Altreus: I don't have chromium on this computer, but I do see 3 different behaviors in 3 browsers and agree it is odd/surprising.
[03:52:14] <jamesdotnet> er, nm
[03:55:08] <joeyjones> jamesdotnet: welcome to web development :p
[03:56:13] <jamesdotnet> touche :)
[04:21:28] <saedelaere> hi
[04:22:39] <toooni> hi everyone.. can anybody tell me how i can make the jquery ui datepicker (inline) to work as a normal form field? i used the option altField.. the field gets updated when i choose a date.. but i want to set the default date from this field at beginning too..
[04:22:47] <saedelaere> I add an images to a div.
[04:22:53] <saedelaere> $('#top_pic').prepend('<img id="#imgBackWoman"  src="..." />');
[04:23:36] <saedelaere> now I want  to access this image in another function that is called via setInterval
[04:24:01] <saedelaere> seems like the selector does not work, maybe unknown to jQuery because I added it??
[04:24:05] <saedelaere> confuses me :)
[04:26:03] <quicksilver> saedelaere: note that you have given it an ID with a # in.
[04:26:18] <quicksilver> maybe you meant <img id="imgBackWoman" ... >
[04:26:30] <saedelaere> quicksilver: ahhhh yes :D
[04:26:34] <saedelaere> stupid me
[04:26:38] <saedelaere> thanks so much!
[04:30:54] <shadykhan> how can i make an if then statement and have the condition be if #header has a class?
[04:32:06] <brotspinne> hello. does anyone know how to stop paging or inject a slide on runtime with the jquery cycle plugin? I want to display an advert after each fourth element but this must be dynamic so I can decide when to inject the ad
[04:32:40] <brotspinne> shadykhan: if ($('#header').hasClass('...'))
[04:34:05] <shadykhan> thank you
[04:35:01] <brotspinne> shadykhan: but it's not smart to name an identifier "header" because in html 5 this is a tag
[04:37:54] <brotspinne> no one?
[04:44:12] <soee> any suggestion how mnake scripts liek lightox, fancybox work on elements that are loaded through ajax ?
[04:53:16] <gabriel9|work> why .style() returns different values on Chrome and FF?
[04:54:14] <gabriel9|work> for fixed element, in Chrome return 'auto' and in FF return 'somePixelValue'
[05:07:26] <bastetmilo> hi, me again - I have problem with page jumping to top when I try to write something in input text field - but it only happends in Firefoks... What can make that?
[05:11:02] <pachet> bastetmilo: are you able to demonstrate this in a fiddle?
[05:12:14] <mercenary> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqv-ZzXpeAs
[05:12:44] <bastetmilo> pachet: I can show you the website
[05:13:01] <crooksey> Hi, Im trying to move tr's between tables using jquery and I cant get it to work, can anyone tell me what Im doing wrong? http://dpaste.com/777960/
[05:25:08] <sahbeewah> crooksey: you can't drag/drop table rows
[05:25:40] <crooksey> Well that answers that then, what should I be using?
[05:26:12] <sahbeewah> there's plugins out there, never used them
[05:26:14] <sahbeewah> so try one i guess
[06:03:10] <Crucials> can i have .mousemove() inside .mousedown()? So the that an element only moves if the mouse is clicked
[06:04:01] <lathan> Crucials, technically you can bind the events as such, but I can't tell you if it will work or not
[06:04:08] <lathan> Crucials, is this inside a dragable / sortable ?
[06:04:21] <Crucials> I want to make an item draggable
[06:05:22] <lathan> ?ui draggable @ Crucials
[06:05:28] <lathan> bot-t: are you there?
[06:05:37] <Crucials> :(
[06:05:50] <lathan> Crucials, try this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[06:05:57] <Crucials> So the method im attempting isnt the best one
[06:05:59] <lathan> Crucials, jQuery UI has a lot of good stuff
[06:06:11] <lathan> Crucials, have you tried using it and it didn't work?
[06:06:33] <Crucials> well it did work at first, but then it kept being "pushed" even with mouse not being down
[06:07:17] <lathan> well Crucial, if you .mousedown( bind.mousmouve) when the mouse unclicks, the mousemove event handler isn't stopped
[06:07:33] <faraway> Crucials: there could be many pitfalls if you try to implement dragable yourself, so if ui dragable will work for you it is better to use this, only if you really need to implement it yourself you should do it
[06:07:42] <lathan> .mousedown( bind mousemove).mouseup(unbind mousemove)
[06:07:55] <lathan> faraway, I did try to tell 'em that....
[06:08:17] <Crucials> faraway, I dont really "need" to do it myself. But I enjoy the experimenting and learning process
[06:09:58] <faraway> Crucials: an additionalready sayed:  the mouse up will not always be triggered, e.g. if the mouse up happens outside the browsers window some browsers versions won't trigger mouseup
[06:10:24] <lathan> Crucials, you want to learn? look through the source code of jQuery UI
[06:10:41] <lathan> Crucials, it will be much more valuable to you to use UI and understand the internals
[06:10:54] <lathan> Crucials, and valuable to the community if you help others
[06:12:37] <sahbeewah> is jsfiddle working for anybody else
[06:13:00] <lathan> sahbeewah, doesn't seem like it\
[06:13:44] <sahbeewah> ok thanks
[06:14:14] <lathan> sahbeewah, wait...it loaded...just slow
[06:14:33] <lathan> sahbeewah, it took 40 seconds to load the page...ouch
[06:27:28] <jlebrech> hi, i'm trying to select the current item in a paginator from the following https://gist.github.com/87aafe622ebf71f1768b using a selector, i want to select the number in the li where there is no anchor child.
[06:28:08] <bamarni> what is the simplest way to do an accept / refuse form? I was thinking doing an hidden input and changing its value when a click is done on accept or refuse, but it looks like a workaround
[06:28:53] <lathan> bamarni, $('form').submit(function(){ if(bad){ return false; } })
[06:29:16] <lathan> bamarni, do you want the number inthe html?
[06:29:56] <bamarni> lathan: but this won't submit the form if I return false?
[06:33:22] <lathan> bamarni, correct. returning false does two things. it stops the events browser action: event.preventDefault(), and it stops the event from calling other handlers: event.stopPropagation()
[06:36:34] <bamarni> lathan: but I need to send the form in both cases, the only thinkg is that I'm looking for a way to know wich button has been clickes (approve or refuse); it could be a post parameter, or send to different urls, I don't know how I can simply do the difference.
[06:38:01] <lathan> bamarni, well, if you have two different submit buttons you can tell which one they clicked on server side
[06:38:22] <lathan> bamarni, else, that hidden field option is probably the best
[06:38:49] <surial> Is there any way to make a circular thing which is a click target? I can make square click targets...
[06:39:38] <faraway> surial: so you mean that the outside of the circle will not trigger the click event ?
[06:39:52] <surial> yeah. It doesn't have to be jquery, but I'm guessing I need fancy javascript here.
[06:39:58] <surial> <a href><some thing that is a circle></a>.
[06:40:00] <bamarni> lathan: how can I know? I've tried to put different id, name, but I can't see any info on post parameters
[06:40:58] <lathan> bamarni, the value of the submit button is sent
[06:41:29] <faraway> surial: http://tympanus.net/TipsTricks/HoverClickTriggerCircle/
[06:41:34] <lathan> bamarni, "Accept" or "Reject" will get sent in the "submit" parameter
[06:41:35] <lathan> <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Accept" />
[06:41:35] <lathan> <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Reject" />
[06:42:43] <faraway> surial: it requires Modernizer, and i haven't tested it if it is cross browser, and works everywhere
[06:42:57] <surial> faraway: It's a great start. thanks!
[07:06:25] <gabriel1> var stateReasonArray = $('#state_reason_hidden'); <--- will this fetch the array I have stored in my hidden input element with class "state_reason_hidden"?
[07:07:17] <gabriel1> hmm, perhaps $('state_reason_hidden').val() ?
[07:07:34] <hlveheart> shoky.
[07:07:39] * hlveheart punches shoky
[07:07:51] <shadykhan> i am fading in element removing its class and then fading it back in. But when i do that it fades and removes its class at the same time how can i fix that?
[07:07:52] * shoky slaps hlveheart around a bit with a wakeboard
[07:08:00] * hlveheart grins
[07:08:23] <hlveheart> shoky, can you help my buddy out at all?
[07:08:30] * hlveheart \o's shoky.
[07:08:41] <hlveheart> shadykhan = my buddy.
[07:08:45] <shoky> yarp
[07:08:47] <shoky> o
[07:09:29] <shoky> shadykhan: remove its class in the callback to the first fade animation
[07:09:58] <Zhy> hey everyone I have a table with say 10 rows, now when I pick two rows, how can I determine which one is the first in the dom / table order?
[07:10:17] <shadykhan> shoky can you explain a little bit more jquery isnt my strong suite
[07:10:32] <shoky> Zhy: you can use .index()
[07:10:48] <Zhy> ah great, thanks shoky :)
[07:11:24] <hlveheart> shoky should get a wizard cloak with his name imprinted on it, and under it in gold capitol letters it should state "I am the jquery masta"
[07:11:29] <hlveheart> o.o
[07:12:36] <shoky> shadykhan: http://jsfiddle.net/cUsfx/
[07:12:54] <shadykhan> thanks bro
[07:12:56] <shadykhan> you the man <3
[07:13:44] <anew> if i need to manipulate an element of a class, how do i do it for that specific element if there is no id ?
[07:13:49] <anew> i.e. mouseover
[07:14:22] <shoky> anew: probably with $(this)
[07:14:42] <lathan> gabriel1, first of all: the class selector is the period, so $('.state_reason_hidden'), and second of all: that will return a jquery selection of that element, but not any data stored on it. you probably want to to .val() at the end of that to get the value of the hidden field.
[07:16:06] <lathan> gabriel1, ah, sorry...didn't see your post with the .val() but you need the class-selector "."
[07:16:40] <lathan> hlveheart, sorry shoky, but if there were such a cape it should probably go to ajpiano
[07:16:41] <LineDropper25> Can some1 help me, I cant see msg reponse.. (At least I think so) so ill msg u and tell me on the public chat if you received it, and then just msg me back to see if I cant get it.
[07:16:47] <anew> shoky well first i dunno why this doesn't work here to show you, but on my site this is what i have and when i mouseenter over 'odd' description for both appears.  but i only want description for one to appear.   http://jsfiddle.net/9WTEE/2/
[07:17:54] <shoky> anew you need to choose jquery ;p
[07:18:17] <anew> oh lol
[07:18:38] <shoky> anew: http://jsfiddle.net/9WTEE/4/
[07:18:39] <anew> ok then my real question lol.... how do i make description appear for the element that i am on and not both ?
[07:18:48] <shoky> like i said, with $(this)
[07:18:54] <anew> ah
[07:18:55] <anew> and .next
[07:18:56] <anew> boom
[07:18:57] <anew> thanks
[07:19:12] <anew> btw is there a calmer irc you are in for jquery shoky ? always so many people in here
[07:19:36] <shoky> only us two talking now
[07:19:41] <shoky> seems pretty calm to me ;)
[07:20:02] <lathan> I'm bobbing in and out...
[07:20:07] <codepython777> http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/17/ -- how do i make it work for multiple rating elements?
[07:20:08] <lathan> its the huge list of inactives that's crazy
[07:20:18] <anew> lol
[07:20:32] <shoky> why on earth don't you disable it on your irc client..
[07:20:37] <shoky> show only chat messages plx.
[07:20:49] <anew> can u do that on webchat ?
[07:20:55] <shoky> yes
[07:21:02] <faraway> lathan is doing such a good job that the rest of us don't need so say a thing ;)
[07:21:06] <lathan> haha
[07:21:18] <lathan> well, I am at work....so you guys start picking up more slack :P
[07:21:33] <lathan> you have...
[07:21:38] <faraway> and he is always faster, i think it's not a human :D
[07:21:48] <anew> damn that jfiddle doesnt work on my site .... must be some conflict somewhere
[07:22:55] <lathan> ?bot
[07:22:59] <codepython777> anew: are you trying this -- http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/17/ ?
[07:23:06] <lathan> faraway, you think I'm being fast now?
[07:23:18] <lathan> faraway, you should see it when me and ajpiano used to dual over answer speed
[07:23:22] <anew> wtf is that lol
[07:23:36] <lathan> someone would answer a question and within several seconds we'd give two different answers near simultaneously
[07:23:39] <lathan> *ask
[07:23:44] <anew> was that meant for me codepython777 ?
[07:24:16] <codepython777> anew: I thought you were trying to open this jsfiddle. I was trying to figure out how to get two star rating widgets work on one page -- http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/17/
[07:25:46] <Penguin> How can I do it so if a div is already visable and i toddle another all open ones close http://jsfiddle.net/t5tbe/20/ cheers
[07:27:07] <faraway> lathan: today i do not really follow the channel that much cause i'm deep in some own javascripts problems. it's just the impression i got over the time :D
[07:27:24] <lathan> I do like the rush...
[07:28:05] <shoky> codepython777 you need to give each set of radios a differnet name
[07:28:48] <codepython777> shoky: you mean "rating" should be changed for each set?
[07:28:55] <shoky> yes
[07:29:01] <codepython777> shoky: then I'd have to generate css for each one ! ?
[07:29:02] <shoky> name="rating"
[07:29:07] <shoky> no, you wouldn't
[07:29:16] <shoky> i said change the names of the radios, not change the class of the containing div
[07:29:18] <lathan> codepython777, put a class on them all and put css on that
[07:29:38] <shoky> don't need that, the css is fine as it is
[07:30:04] <codepython777> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/18/ -- something like this?
[07:30:14] <anew> shoky http://pastebin.com/z12WVuCS the first one does not work, but the secod one works... any ideas why ?  problem is second one shows all .description on page
[07:30:35] <anew> first one works in jfiddle but not on live site....
[07:30:43] <shoky> codepython777 yes but you also have duplicate ids for the inputs
[07:30:51] <codepython777> Penguin: Can't you go thru all elements that are open and close them first (at click), then open the one you need?
[07:30:53] <shoky> codepython777 and so your labels for=  are also duplicate, messing things up
[07:31:06] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I'm using jQuery's $.each and I was wondering how I could have code execute after the loop was finished?
[07:31:32] <codepython777> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/20/ ?
[07:31:50] <shoky> codepython777: that's one half , yes
[07:31:56] <shoky> codepython777: the <label for=   need to match
[07:31:59] <codepython777> hold on
[07:32:09] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, is $.each asynchonous? you should just be able to run code after the $.each loop in the code
[07:32:40] <codepython777> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/21/ ?
[07:32:48] <Penguin> codepython777: Im a bit new to this lol
[07:32:52] <shoky> codepython777: it works, doesnt it?
[07:33:08] <codepython777> shoky: yes. In jquery calls, how do i select the correct one?
[07:33:08] <DeltaHeavy|Work> lathan: If I put an alert under the $.each it executes at before the loop finishes.
[07:33:20] <shoky> codepython777: man.. you can figure that out yourself
[07:33:33] <codepython777> k. thanks
[07:34:04] <LindsayMac> gash jquery is so fickle..
[07:34:36] <anew> shoky any idea why this doesnt work live?  top one doesnt work, bottom one does.... http://pastebin.com/z12WVuCS
[07:34:40] <lathan> LindsayMac, actually jQuery makes javascript less fickle
[07:34:59] <LindsayMac> well sure... but its still fickle none the less
[07:35:01] <codepython777> shoky: I tried this -- $("#hash1 .rating input[name=rating][value=3]").prop('checked',true);
[07:35:07] <DeltaHeavy|Work> JavaScript was fickle?
[07:35:36] <shoky> codepython777: we changed their names, remember?
[07:35:43] <DeltaHeavy|Work> jsFiddle of my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/cnpeN/    Won't work in jsfiddle but I get the alert immediately.
[07:35:57] <codepython777> shoky: ! Thanks !
[07:36:14] <shoky> ;]
[07:36:19] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, if LindsayMac thinks jQuery is fickle...then must think javascript....probably all computer scripting/programming
[07:36:42] <shoky> anew: that'd really depend on what you have in your page, i cant know just looking at that
[07:36:52] <LindsayMac> nahhh php is very logical to me..
[07:36:59] <DeltaHeavy|Work> lathan: There's a different between a language being fickle and being bad/unknowable about the language you're using.
[07:37:21] <DeltaHeavy|Work> LindsayMac: PHP and JS are executed in two different ways for different purposes. It's like comparing apples to oranges :P
[07:37:43] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Like right now I'm trying to figure out how to execute code 'X' AFTER code 'Y', which in PHP is like "Just 'X' before 'Y'"
[07:38:10] <anew> shoky just duno where to look for the conflict? in the css ? jq?
[07:38:16] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: the alert is executing AFTER the .each loop
[07:38:20] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: as expected
[07:38:20] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, @fickle...oh I know...just trying to not make fun of him
[07:38:39] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, alerts sometimes get themselves out of order when the all pile up in the queue
[07:38:41] <DeltaHeavy|Work> shoky: Are you sure? It's not for me. How are you determining that?
[07:38:50] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, see this example, both ways work the same: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/RFy3L/
[07:38:50] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: because that's how javascript works
[07:38:55] <hlveheart> lol
[07:39:04] <codepython777> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/9nLPX/24/ -- Got it working, thanks :)
[07:39:11] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, mostly javascript is synchronous. only certain calls fork into seperate thread
[07:39:13] <lathan> s
[07:39:28] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work:  the browser is loading the images in a seperate thread..
[07:39:43] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: if you want something to happen after an image is loaded, use .load()
[07:39:53] <DeltaHeavy|Work> shoky: Alerts halt execution. It doesn't mean the $.each isn't doing what it's doing asynchronous to everything else.
[07:40:00] <DeltaHeavy|Work> shoky: I want something to happen after ALL the images are loaded.
[07:40:16] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: then use .load()
[07:40:35] <DeltaHeavy|Work> That would be after an image is loaded. Not after ALL images are loaded.
[07:40:40] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy|Work: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded/
[07:41:15] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I won't want to use an other library. What I got is fine, I just want to execute code AFTER the $.each
[07:41:34] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: then use .load() for ALL images
[07:41:49] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Then I'd be executing the code each time an image is loaded
[07:42:02] <shoky> yes
[07:42:15] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy|Work: it's not a "library" it's a speciifc event for the *exact thing you want*
[07:42:18] <ajpiano> look at the code for it
[07:42:19] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work that code is executing AFTER the $.each
[07:42:21] <ajpiano> if you don't want to use its code
[07:42:36] <ajpiano> cause it's literally prety stupid for someone to sit here and describe a technique that's documneted in code
[07:42:39] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I want to execute code ONCE after the $.each   I could do something messy with a variable and stuff in the $.each but I'd rather not
[07:42:41] <shoky> the .each doesnt load the images
[07:42:41] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Let me take al ook
[07:42:46] <shoky> it only sets their attribute
[07:42:50] <shoky> that happens instantly
[07:42:52] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy|Work: the load event on images is notoriously fickle
[07:44:05] <DeltaHeavy|Work> ajpiano: 'A jQuery plugin' - From the page. I don't want to add other libraries.
[07:44:06] <lathan> ajpiano, shoky: DeltaHeavy|Work seems to do something with $.each to create the images...or something...not giving full context
[07:44:20] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy|Work: don't be obstinate
[07:44:24] <DeltaHeavy|Work> What I pasted pre-loads images.
[07:44:41] <DeltaHeavy|Work> ajpiano: I'm not. I don't want to use other libraries and stuff for things I'm already successfully doing.
[07:44:56] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/cnpeN/1/
[07:44:58] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I just need to have something execute after the $.each is done executing.
[07:45:29] <ajpiano> oh
[07:45:36] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy|Work: is the action inside of the each itself synchroonous
[07:45:58] <ajpiano> or does it trigger more async action?
[07:46:24] <DeltaHeavy|Work> ajpiano: I need something to execute after the $.each that would be outside the $.each
[07:46:36] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: the .each finishes looping INSTANTLY
[07:46:44] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy|Work: the basic trick is to check the loop iteration you're on and compare it to the .length of what you're iterating
[07:46:45] <ajpiano> sorry i'm ont he phone
[07:47:01] <DeltaHeavy|Work> shoky: That works. I'd prefer another way if possible. For example with animate I can do: $('#something').animate({left: 80}, function() { alert("This happens after'); });
[07:47:16] <DeltaHeavy|Work> shoky: Ok I see now
[07:47:28] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Sorry my 2nd last message was @ ajpiano
[07:47:35] <Brodingo> ajpiano is there a poilte way to say your rude
[07:48:47] <lathan> Brodingo, if you are a colleague
[07:48:56] <Brodingo> ;)
[07:49:32] <lathan> Brodingo, ajpiano's not being rude....it can be verry annoying some of the constraints people put on their work.
[07:49:46] <lathan> Brodingo, and we did just have a 4 person mix-up in communication
[07:49:59] <Brodingo> its ok lathan i was jokes
[07:51:10] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: also check out http://jsfiddle.net/cnpeN/3/
[07:54:02] <shoky> actually http://jsfiddle.net/cnpeN/4/
[07:55:07] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Ok thanks I got it now!
[07:55:14] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: that is no different than "using another library". you ARE obstinate
[07:55:40] <shoky> and you don't listen
[07:55:55] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, shoky, well....copying it into your own source code just means the same amount of data has to be downloaded but in only 1 call, rather than 2 calls that the browser might parallelize
[07:56:29] <LindsayMac> Is there a way to display a pdf in a lightbox-style effect WITHOUT the need for the browser to have the plugin available?
[07:56:30] <shoky> "using a library" and "including another file"  are two seperate things
[07:57:26] <hariom> I want to implement a widget which can inform about the most popular articles based on the RSS feeds users have accessed. Any direction on it?
[07:57:54] <trailbar> anybody recommend a contextmenu plugin for jquery?
[08:01:03] <TorpedoSkyline> so I have a question. Should we worry about users that have their JS turned off? I'm working on a WordPress site that uses plugins but I don't want to modify the code in the plugins because when an update ships all my code is gone. I'd like to add classes to elements using a separate JS file using jQuery, but I'm worried about those users.
[08:01:44] <hlveheart> TorpedoSkyline, not enough people browse without JS enabled.
[08:01:51] <hlveheart> I wouldn't worry so much about them
[08:02:07] <TorpedoSkyline> hlveheart, that's what I'm thinking. And if they don't have JS enabled they generally know.
[08:02:20] <TorpedoSkyline> and devices that don't have JS support besides old Nokia phones? ;P
[08:02:20] <Brodingo> i think there was a yahoo study that said like 97% of people have js enabled?
[08:02:36] <hlveheart> you already have to worry about browser wide compatibility... you shouldn't have to worry about JS disabled browsers
[08:02:41] <hlveheart> lol
[08:02:48] <TorpedoSkyline> +1 hlveheart
[08:02:54] <hlveheart> :)
[08:03:11] <TorpedoSkyline> I'm thinking no one will notice. I don't know anyone with JS disabled and if they do they're living in the 20th century.
[08:03:12] <shoky> +1 he has vagina like my wizard's sleeve
[08:03:24] <hlveheart> Lol
[08:03:27] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky
[08:03:30] * hlveheart grins
[08:03:30] <TorpedoSkyline> wat
[08:03:30] <b-ot> I am so sorry to hear that.My LADY GAGA....
[08:03:42] <shoky> TorpedoSkyline: my apologies
[08:03:46] <TorpedoSkyline> lol XD
[08:03:50] <TorpedoSkyline> shoky, what are your thoughts?
[08:03:56] <timing> Hi!
[08:03:59] <hlveheart> Hi timing.
[08:04:05] <shoky> precisely? "fuck them no-js bastards"
[08:04:09] <hlveheart> ^^^^^
[08:04:12] <hlveheart> ding ding ding ding ding.
[08:04:20] <TorpedoSkyline> haha
[08:04:23] <TorpedoSkyline> Well that's good.
[08:04:26] <shoky> ;]
[08:04:30] <TorpedoSkyline> I'll be using jQuery. ;P
[08:04:32] * pachet browses with js disabled most of the time
[08:04:44] <hlveheart> you're sketchy though
[08:04:48] * hlveheart slaps pachet around a bit with a large trout
[08:04:54] * pachet looks around sketchily
[08:04:59] <hlveheart> lol.
[08:05:15] <TorpedoSkyline> I mean jQuery supports most browsers, and I really don't want to modify the code in a WordPress plugin.
[08:05:23] <timing> I expected .next('.classname') to return the first next element with class="classname". Am I the only one here?
[08:05:28] <hlveheart> most browsers support jquery :P
[08:05:47] <TorpedoSkyline> hlveheart ;)
[08:05:49] <hlveheart> :P
[08:06:12] <hlveheart> http://youtube.com/watch?v=-XsgVtLVyZM
[08:07:04] <shoky> timing: you should only expect what the docs tell you to. you're looking for .nextAll('.classname').first()
[08:07:33] <Shapeshifter> Hi. I'm trying to bind a click event handler to a jquery object but it fails. I'm doing: item = $('<div class="item"/>'); item.click(function() { console.log("test"); }); but this throws an odd error somewhere in jquery: Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object Object].
[08:08:39] <pachet> Shapeshifter: throws an error on the handler assignment? or when the handler tries to execute?
[08:09:22] <Shapeshifter> pachet: I can't really tell because the error is said to be in my jquery.js. It's minified. I should probably get the dev version to see what's happening.
[08:11:03] <shoky> Shapeshifter are you getting the error here http://jsfiddle.net/wGsN6/
[08:11:04] <faraway> Shapeshifter: does the same thing happen if you do $('<div class="item"></div>');
[08:11:29] <timing> shoky: yes ofcourse. after reading the docs I was okay with it. But just wondering if I'm the only one 'expecting' this without reading
[08:11:41] <shoky> timing: no, you're not
[08:11:46] <Shapeshifter> shoky: nope, I just tried myself, it seems to work: http://jsfiddle.net/GE6Uc/
[08:12:06] <shoky> Shapeshifter: then obviously it's not those 2 lines of code by themselves that cause the error
[08:12:43] <shoky> Shapeshifter: reproduce your issue in a fiddle
[08:13:17] <Shapeshifter> shoky: yeah I'll need to look into it.
[08:15:57] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Is there any way to have a callback on .attr where it's already changing (not returning) the value of something? .attr('src', 'images/blah.png', function() { alert("YO"); });
[08:16:27] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: the attribute change happens instantly
[08:16:37] <shoky> DeltaHeavy|Work: just like your .each() loop
[08:17:18] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Yeah, but is there a way to give it a callback?
[08:17:26] <shoky> no, that would be meaningless
[08:17:29] <hariom> I want to implement a widget which can inform about the most popular articles based on the RSS feeds users have accessed. Any direction on it?
[08:18:00] <DeltaHeavy|Work> eg, I had an each, and a bunch of .attr's in there. I want a value to increment as the .attr is called as opposed to it going through the loop
[08:18:06] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Unrelated to my last question just want to know
[08:18:18] <timing> hariom: well, first you have to know which articles the users have accessed
[08:18:36] <shoky> bla.attr('src','bla.jpg');  /* whatever you run here happens AFTER the attribute is already changed */
[08:25:29] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, you could put an intermediate function on attr that triggers an event 'attributeChanged'. but you'd have to do some plugin / "sticking fingers into jquery internals"
[08:25:56] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, or you could just change all your code from $('div').attr('...','''.) to add .trigger('attributeChanged')
[08:26:00] <DeltaHeavy|Work> lathan: I think I'll avoid that. I'll find another way I guess. Thanks!
[08:26:08] <DeltaHeavy|Work> I'll give that a try
[08:26:10] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Thanks!
[08:26:23] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, if you control all the .attr calls, then its just the pain of updating it
[08:29:13] <lathan> DeltaHeavy|Work, the modding way is something this (I will guarantee at least 2 errors in this: var _attr = jQuery.attr; jQuery.attr = function(){ _attr.apply(this,arguments); jQuery(this).trigger('attributeChanged'); };
[08:29:20] <NodeX> attr() has depreciated too iirc
[08:29:35] <NodeX> use prop() ;)
[08:30:01] <lathan> NodeX, is prop supposed to replace all of attr? or just properties vs other things?
[08:30:14] <shoky> attr is not deprecated
[08:30:16] <NodeX> both
[08:30:22] <shoky> each serves a different purpose
[08:30:27] <NodeX> it's more an extension of attr()
[08:30:32] <shoky> no it's not
[08:30:41] <NodeX> ?prop
[08:30:45] <lathan> the doc page does not say it is deprecated
[08:30:47] <lathan> bot-t is gone
[08:30:56] <lathan> ajpiano, was working on a repalcement....but its not on
[08:31:01] <NodeX> it's in the process of depreciating then
[08:31:02] <shoky> attr is for HTML attributes, prop is for DOM properties
[08:31:12] <shoky> NodeX: so wrong
[08:31:13] <lathan> ^^that's what I thought
[08:31:59] <lathan> prop is attributes that have a boolean set / not set value, rather than a string value
[08:32:46] <shoky> no
[08:33:16] <NodeX> prop() works for getting and setting and works for attr() too
[08:33:26] <shoky> depends what
[08:33:30] <NodeX> prop() is all round better at it and should be used where appropriate
[08:33:32] <pachet> misinformation ho!
[08:33:37] <shoky> ;]
[08:33:47] <shoky> anyway, it's all here: http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[08:33:59] <shoky> and here: http://timmywillison.com/2011/When-to-use-.attr()-and-.prop().html
[08:36:12] <gyzmodo> how to use this code <input type="text" placeholder="Name" id="name" autofocus="autofocus" /> but leave placeholder's value in Firefox, IE9 like in Chrome
[08:36:37] <NodeX> eh?
[08:38:32] <DeltaHeavy|Work> gyzmodo: http://www.caniuse.com/#search=placeholder
[08:39:53] <gyzmodo> i've been there
[08:40:13] <gyzmodo> NodeX, http://jsfiddle.net/yXSvQ/
[08:40:50] <gyzmodo> check out it in Chrome and Firefox or IE9 and you will see a problem
[08:42:19] <NodeX> err, that's expected behaviour
[08:42:44] <NodeX> chrome just doesn't remove it until you type a letter - that's browser quirks
[08:42:56] <gyzmodo> yeah, Chrome works like a charm
[08:43:15] <FernandoBasso> Whith this code, var $inputs = $('#form1 :input[type=text]') I've got
[08:43:16] <FernandoBasso> serveral input fields that have the attribute 'name' values like 'f1', 'f2', 'f3', etc. Is it possible to do something like $arr['one'] = {'var1': $inputs['f1'].value, 'var2': $inputs['f2'].value]};
[08:43:19] <FernandoBasso> ['two'] = {'varn': $inputs'fn'].value, etc}... ?
[08:43:38] <gyzmodo> NodeX, any elegant ideas?
[08:44:22] <lathan> FernandoBasso, I think you either want to try $.map, or write a function that returns those...dynamically create the reference
[08:45:31] <NodeX> gyzmodo : bind to the focus of them and check for a keypress and the length of the current value ... if it's <=0 then set the value to the prop("placeholder") ...
[08:45:38] <NodeX> else clear the value
[08:45:47] <FernandoBasso> lathan: Let me see. Thanks.
[08:45:56] <LindsayMac> has anyone used a swipe slider to build an entire mobile website off of.. like a single-page style site?
[08:46:10] <NodeX> it's a hack .. people who are used to placeholders expect thier browser to behave a certain way
[08:46:40] <lathan> NodeX, gyzmodo probably bind to blur to put it back.....the placeholder should reappear when they leave the field if its blank
[08:46:44] <lathan> *blur also
[08:47:28] <gyzmodo> lathan, can you show example? :)
[08:48:59] <NodeX> lathan : that;s implicit
[08:49:23] <FernandoBasso> lathan: Could you give an example on how I could use $.map in that case? Sorry, I'm really lost..
[08:49:39] <lathan> NodeX, are you saying that binding to focus implies binding to blur? in the code, or in your verbage?
[08:50:10] <NodeX> in my explination, what goes up must come down ;)
[08:51:50] <lathan> NodeX, yes. and you and I and other experienced jQuery-ers know that. but most people asking questions don't get that
[08:51:52] <lathan> implicitly
[08:53:30] <lathan> gyzmodo, example: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/kMcMu/
[08:53:39] <gyzmodo> one moment
[08:54:58] <ajpiano> lathan: i am not personally working on the replacement, a replacement is being wokred on :p
[09:00:07] <lathan> oh, excuse me ajpiano lol
[09:00:18] <lathan> don't dash our confidence....
[09:00:34] <lathan> FernandoBasso, I don't understand what type of output you want
[09:01:31] <lathan> you said {'one' : { 'var1': ...,'var2':...}, 'two': {'varn':...}} and I don't understand the difference betwene 'one' and 'two'...seem they both have the whole list, or they each have only 1 element
[09:02:08] <gyzmodo> lathan, is your example without autofocus?
[09:02:23] <FernandoBasso> Actually, I need to groupd 'f1', 'f2' and 'f3' in one array. 'f4', 'f5' and 'f6' in other, and so forth.
[09:02:29] <lathan> gyzmodo, I just triggered the blur handler on begin
[09:02:33] <FernandoBasso> s/groupd/group/
[09:03:20] <lathan> FernandoBasso, in programming terms the operation you are wanting to do is called a map reduce. or grouping
[09:04:19] <rue> map/reduce is a very specific workflow. Just a map function isnt the same
[09:04:48] <lathan> rue he wants to pull the integer out of the name, then group every 3 inputs into a seperate array...sounds like a reduce operation to me
[09:05:09] <sonnie> hi, i use json2html to load JSON data into "data.html". when loading "data.html" in jqueryui's 'tabs' via ajax mode, the screen is refreshed twice. how to stop this?
[09:05:25] <FernandoBasso> I need an array, cotaining 'subarrays', where each subarray contains the next 3 'fn' from all the input fields. But since the input fields have names, and they are always like 'a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3'.
[09:05:58] <FernandoBasso> That is why I thought I'd be able to use those 'a1' etc when retrieving the values.
[09:06:49] <gyzmodo> lathan, thanks
[09:08:45] <rue> FernandoBasso: You could group them by the first character of the name, yes
[09:09:28] <rue> If you can adjust the source data, thatd probably be more sensible, but if not
[09:10:51] <lathan> FernandoBasso, if you can't adjust the letter to group by, you can do this math algorithm to do it: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/EHH9a/
[09:11:29] <lathan> FernandoBasso, rue, regex the integer out of it, then group it by a integer division by 3
[09:12:15] <FernandoBasso> https://gist.github.com/3208092
[09:15:07] <sonnie> i have the same problem as http://www.datatables.net/forums/discussion/5869/jquery-tabs-and-ajax/p1. how to solve it?
[09:15:20] <rue> ^^ That works too, Id just do result[name[0]].push(name); or equivalent.
[09:35:04] <TorpedoSkyline> is it possible to select every element who's number is dividable by three?
[09:35:24] <TorpedoSkyline> So be able to select element 3, 6, 9, 12 in a <ul>?
[09:36:52] <LindsayMac> how do you guys test and debug iphone interactions?
[09:37:44] <ktstowell> TorpedoSkyline: You could write a simple iterator to push them into an array or jq objects, but I just learned this cool thing for doing algorithmic selectors with css at OSCON. Will have to look through my notes though.
[09:38:17] <TorpedoSkyline> ok thanks ktstowell! =)
[09:39:01] <ktstowell> in the mean time though
[09:39:15] <ktstowell> jsut drop the ul in an $.each
[09:39:27] <ktstowell> and do the math on the index
[09:39:35] <ktstowell> to selecte them
[09:39:42] <ktstowell> and push them in an array
[09:39:55] <ktstowell> since you're doing this with js anyways
[09:40:51] <jSpike> hi, can someone answer a question for me? I have a list of elems that have an attribute and text, I also have another elem that has text in it.  So what I want to do is get the attribute from the elem in the list that has the same text as the 2nd element...
[09:41:09] <hlveheart> "hi, can someone answer a question for me?" lol.
[09:41:19] <hlveheart> just ask y0 question. don't ask to ask.
[09:41:19] <hlveheart> ;P
[09:41:27] <TorpedoSkyline> ktstowell, ok I'll research that. Thanks again.
[09:41:32] <LindsayMac> jSpike:  you might be best off showing your work.. if you don't have a live example, use jsfiddle.net
[09:41:39] <hlveheart> ^^
[09:42:03] <ktstowell> I can throw you a fiddle in a min - at work though, about to do our standup
[09:42:12] <jSpike> ok, sry, noob at irc
[09:42:19] <hlveheart> lol
[09:43:17] <LindsayMac> jSpike:  its ok.. saying "can someone help answer my question" is not all that bad..
[09:59:47] <jedahan> whats the best way to iterate over a definition list to associate dd contents with the corresponding dt?
[09:59:51] <jSpike> ok, so my fiddle is here http://jsfiddle.net/jSpike/T4dhH/3/ I want to compare the texts from the div with the list of options and get the attribute of a match
[10:02:38] <TorpedoSkyline> ktstowell, I think I've got something

[10:03:47] <TorpedoSkyline> ktstowell http://pastie.org/4360220
[10:03:55] <TorpedoSkyline> or I could JSFiddle it
[10:03:58] <hlveheart> USE JSFIDDLE. >:/

[10:04:14] * hlveheart takes out his jsfiddle-themed whip.
[10:04:18] <ktstowell>  fiddle or snipt
[10:04:19] <TorpedoSkyline> hlveheart <3
[10:04:21] <jedahan> http://jsfiddle.net/B3MWj/ < something stupid to illustrate what i am trying to do
[10:04:26] <hlveheart> <3 :)
[10:04:30] <ktstowell> but fiddle++ for interactive runtime
[10:06:42] <TorpedoSkyline> ktstowell, hlveheart http://jsfiddle.net/PLbsT/
[10:06:47] <TorpedoSkyline> It's not an array, but hmm.
[10:07:10] * hlveheart \o's TorpedoSkyline
[10:07:52] <TorpedoSkyline> I'm still learning JS, so I need to find a way to find the number id of a item in an array and find out if it's divisible by i + 1 using %
[10:07:59] <ktstowell> An array/object is only necessary if you need the selectors to persist out of the loop
[10:08:06] <TorpedoSkyline> Will either one put more of a hit on the processor?
[10:08:12] <ktstowell> if you're jsut doing one-off manipulation, yer good.
[10:09:13] <TorpedoSkyline> ah ok. so ktstowell, an array would be what I needed to do if I wanted to roll my own selector argument to be able to select those independently of specific content?
[10:10:20] <TorpedoSkyline> or somethin'? =P
[10:10:37] <ktstowell> Yar - you could build your %3 elements into an object/array and do special handling with them - once your iteration completes.
[10:11:00] <ktstowell> like send them to a decoupled function to do modular/bulk processing
[10:11:09] <ktstowell> if this will be a repetitive task
[10:11:19] <ktstowell> I recommend doing that
[10:11:32] <TorpedoSkyline> ok, I don't think I know enough about jQuery to do that yet. So it would be like building your own function to handle these things if I would be doing it a lot.
[10:12:02] <TorpedoSkyline> And for this site that I'm working on it's only something I do on one page.
[10:16:14] <ktstowell> Well my recommendation is less of a jQuery thing and more of a design pattern type thing. Again, if you're jsut doing one-off manipulation, keeping it inside the loop is fine.
[10:16:48] * hlveheart slaps ktstowell around a bit with a large trout
[10:17:02] <ktstowell> I've been trouted
[10:18:43] <Raydiation> ive built a custom script with modernizr to check for gradients, box-shadow, multi-backgrounds, but theres no easy way to just say ok if this fails display a popup right?
[10:18:51] <Raydiation> i have to manually check for those 3 right?
[10:19:57] <ktstowell> Just create an abstracted method that any of them can call on a false return
[10:23:17] <Raydiation> any experience with this? http://imsky.github.com/cssFx/
[10:24:11] <hariom> Can anybody guide on the mobile app development? There are plenty of frameworks like Sencha touch, phone gap and jquery as well. Which is the best one?
[10:24:20] * hlveheart slaps Raydiation around a bit with a large trout

[10:24:26] <hlveheart> >:/
[10:24:40] <TorpedoSkyline> hariom, I like PhoneGap because it's more native.
[10:24:45] <ktstowell> Ah, the trout is a fiddle invoker
[10:25:14] <TorpedoSkyline> hariom, but if you want a real app you need to check out RubyMotion or just code in ObjC.
[10:25:22] <ktstowell> Raydiation:  i'm not sure it's been repurposed to account for the 13 webkit prefixes tat IE adopted.
[10:25:50] <Raydiation> hlveheart: ?
[10:26:31] <ktstowell> hlveheart:  is the #jquery jsfiddle enforcer it seems.
[10:26:56] <hlveheart> I sure am
[10:27:49] <hariom> TorpedoSkyline: any idea on SenchaTouch?
[10:28:29] <TorpedoSkyline> hariom, I've never used it, but it doesn't even look close to a native iOS app.
[10:28:39] <TorpedoSkyline> And those are kind of clunky anyway. =

[10:32:34] <New0> hi everyone. i am trying to use .datepicker() and mark some of the days of events.
[10:37:24] <jita> I am receiving a json in the function, like foo(bar), if i console.log bar, it comes out as http://dpaste.org/dLva3/, but if i console.log bar.id or any other attribute it says undefined, any reason for that ?
[10:40:40] <ktstowell> try bar["id"]
[10:46:01] <xrated> Any of you fine folk have experience with JS Documentation Generators like JSDoc, PDoc, etc
[10:46:06] <xrated> and which one would you recommend
[10:46:29] <Lyndon> I sent a json request to groups.google.com but I get back this: //OK[0,34,25,33,32,31,etc... ] instead of something like {0,34,25,33,32,31, etc...}  how can i get jquery to parse that?
[10:49:35] <t432> anyone know how to trigger an ajax call when browsers scrollbar reaches to the end?
[10:51:36] <Lyndon> t432: google is your friend man... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3962558/javascript-detect-scroll-end
[10:53:11] <DarkSector> I'd like a grid of thumbnails of images to show up and I'd like to select multiple images from it, like when I select it, it gets highlighted and then when I press a button the array of all the image ids gets pushed to my db (request to the server). How do I do this? Is there a Jquery UI plugin for this?
[10:54:11] <Lyndon> what kind of json response is this?  //OK[0,34,25,33,32,31,etc... ]
[10:54:27] <ktstowell> custom header
[10:54:44] <LindsayMac> So i am trying to pick apart this code and understand it but I am stuck on something and maybe you guys can help.
[10:54:48] <ktstowell> looks like they're .join -ing the http header with the return data
[10:54:51] <LindsayMac> this is the thing I am looking it: http://swipejs.com/
[10:55:10] <lvh> Hi
[10:55:17] <LindsayMac> Basically, I can not understand how he links from the tab to the container. I have downloaded the demos and I see that there is a data-tab, but I don't understand how he's doing it
[10:55:28] <sunbeam> is it a problem to keep something like this in your code (when submitting an ajax form) console.log(xhr.responseText); ?
[10:56:09] <ktstowell> you'll have to regex that out and possible be forced to run nested regex to create a recognizable array from the rest of it.
[10:56:18] <ktstowell> possibly*
[10:56:33] <Lyndon> thanks ktstowell
[10:56:47] <lvh> I'm trying to use the Jquery-File-Upload plugin and I'm having some issues. I ran into the point where it's doing what I believe is equivalent to an $.ajax call. I get the following error in my webkit console: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://image.iglsite.test:8082/. Origin http://www.iglsite.test:8082 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. ## I understand the same-origin policy: this is why I set document.domain = "iglsite.test" -- I figured since both 
[10:57:36] <ktstowell> It woult be performance friendly but you could run a split on the first [ then on the [1] substring run another split on the ',' to get your ints
[10:57:48] <t432> Lyndon: what is the "e" parameter?
[10:58:04] <ktstowell> that would be the least brain intensive way to do it.
[10:58:06] <lvh> Also, weirdly, I'm not seeing any OPTIONS requests coming in on my web server, so it's not like I could answer with some CORS headers even if I wanted to. I just figured that that document.domain hack would sidestep CORS entirely??
[10:58:09] <ktstowell> but costly
[10:58:21] <t432> i assume i have to pass this as param everytime i call the function
[10:58:24] <ktstowell> t432:  browser event
[10:58:41] <ktstowell> no, the browser event is doing that for you
[10:59:14] <ktstowell> like when you do "$.click(function(e) { console.log(e)});
[10:59:38] <t432> ah
[10:59:41] <LindsayMac> From what I can tell, he is adding data-tab="[i] to the panels that are meant to be slid, but that is not happening on my install, and I dont know whatr I did differently
[10:59:49] <ktstowell> that is your gateway into hosted event objects
[10:59:58] <ktstowell> play around with console.loggin them
[11:00:07] <ktstowell> and get familiar, some prtty handy stuff
[11:00:23] <Andweeeee> hey guis. I'mhaving some questions, but I don't want to write them here because they'll probably flood the room all of my issues have to do with arrayscan y'all check this out and answer the 3 questions at the top and/or determine what I'm doing is a stupid way of going about it? http://jsfiddle.net/Luhring/TSFbZ/39/
[11:00:46] <Andweeeee> I'll love you forever if you can explain that noise to me.
[11:00:53] <Andweeeee> nohomo.
[11:01:06] <LindsayMac> nohomo?
[11:01:11] <Andweeeee> sorry the code is a little messy
[11:01:18] <Andweeeee> ok slightly homo.
[11:01:32] <hlveheart> :/
[11:01:41] <ktstowell> i lol'd /shrug
[11:01:43] <Andweeeee> well ok if you're a girl, nosexual.
[11:01:53] <ktstowell> so really
[11:01:55] <ktstowell> allhomo
[11:02:02] <Andweeeee> pretty much
[11:02:04] <Andweeeee> lol
[11:02:06] <LindsayMac> Andweeeee:  i'm not sure i like you...
[11:02:18] <hlveheart> ^
[11:02:43] <hlveheart> LindsayMac, are you related to Bernie?
[11:02:48] <hlveheart> lol.
[11:02:53] <hlveheart> :p
[11:03:05] <lvh> People who read my preceding question: I figured it out. document.domain doesn't actually affect XHR at all, just iframes.
[11:03:07] <LindsayMac> yea he's my cousin
[11:03:17] <lvh> Looks like I will need a new approach to make cross-domain uploads work.
[11:03:21] <lvh> Thanks anyway :)
[11:03:25] <Andweeeee> LindsayMac: I meant no offense. if I offended you, I apologize, but if you'd like to explain how i've offended you in a pm or something, by all means <3
[11:03:44] <LindsayMac> Just dont like the idea of homo=messed up
[11:03:46] <ktstowell> lvh: you look into proxies?
[11:04:22] <ktstowell> I don't think he was refering to homo meaning messed up
[11:04:22] <Andweeeee> lol. well i am gay, so it's probably funny to me a little bit out of some irony thing, but yeah
[11:04:34] <lvh> ktstowell: Yeah. The idea is that there's one API domain and many subdomains that basically jsut serve some static HTML/JS/CSS to consume the API
[11:04:34] <ktstowell> i think he was meaning homo = gay
[11:04:37] <LindsayMac> well.. then I guess its ok.. but ya know -
[11:04:44] <hlveheart> Andweeeee. Being gay doesn't mean it's okay
[11:04:44] <hlveheart> lol
[11:05:01] <hlveheart> :9
[11:05:19] <LindsayMac> things come across differently on IRC.... you sounded like a good ol' boy biggot
[11:05:51] <ktstowell> lvh: microservices? are you getting same-origin errors?
[11:05:59] <lvh> Andweeeee: Gender and sexuality is typically a touchy subject. It can be very easy to mis-state your intent, both in person but even more so on the Internet. As a result, people prefer to avoid it altogether.
[11:06:42] <lvh> ktstowell: Yes, I got: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://image.iglsite.test:8082/. Origin http://www.iglsite.test:8082 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[11:06:53] <LindsayMac> lvh:  i am sure he knows it.. but none the less - just prefer to stay away from people who seemly use homo in a derogatory way.. or mostly any way for that matter.
[11:06:56] <lvh> I thought that document.domain = "iglsite.test" would fix the issue. It did not.
[11:06:58] <LindsayMac> but yea. THAT IS NOT JQUERY
[11:07:05] <ktstowell> Though i wish we are all a little more light-hearted, this is #jquery and perhaps not the most appropriate forum for discussing etiquette.
[11:07:29] <ktstowell> lvh and bouncing it off a proxy first isn't working?
[11:08:04] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  thats just one of my subjects that hits a nerve. I have got a dirty sense of humor.. but over IRC you loose the sarcasm or lightness in the tone of voice, so it sounded biggoted. NO BIG DEAL
[11:08:36] <lvh> ktstowell: I didn't attempt that. I really just wanted Jquery-File-Upload to be able to POST a form that has a file input in it to a different domain
[11:08:39] <Andweeeee> yeah i'm definitely not that. it was meant to be a jokei assure you it comes across differently in person. i think it's a contextual thing. but I agree with LindsayMac,
[11:08:50] <LindsayMac> anyone wanna try and help me with a mobile swipe slider issue? I have an example if you can give me your IP so I can let you know. and you gotta look at the site with user agent iphone.
[11:08:53] <ktstowell> I wasn't critiquing anyone, just making a blanket statement.
[11:09:00] <LindsayMac> Andweeeee:  it's all good... no worries.
[11:09:06] <LindsayMac> hail to the gays... lol
[11:09:09] <lvh> I was hoping that CNAMEing image.somerandomsite.com to image.myapiendpoint.com would work
[11:09:27] <LindsayMac> I'm using this http://swipejs.com/
[11:09:32] <silverwind> "Gay" used to be a nice word...
[11:09:36] <ktstowell> lvh: not gonna work man - you need to build a proxy app on your server first. Or just pust everything on AppFog
[11:09:46] <LindsayMac> silverwind:  still is...
[11:09:49] <Andweeeee> xo. the gays are pretty gay. (in the silverwind sense ;-P)
[11:10:01] <ktstowell> AppFog is beast at microservices architecture.
[11:10:10] <lvh> ktstowell: JQuery File Upload laready has two fallbacks for cross domain uploading
[11:10:25] <lvh> ktstowell: It uses CORS for decent browsers and iframes for crappy ones
[11:10:25] <LindsayMac> Andweeeee:  you aren't from P-town by any chance are you?
[11:10:30] <Andweeeee> play on words. that probably doesnt come across the same either. im just gonna drop it. sorry everyone for sounding like a biggot
[11:10:39] <Andweeeee> nah, dude. chi-town.
[11:10:41] <LindsayMac> I met an Andy who was a dev from p-town ...
[11:10:48] <LindsayMac> ahh ..
[11:10:53] <ktstowell> p-town ++
[11:11:09] <LindsayMac> p-town is so fun!
[11:11:25] <ktstowell> lvh: more like failbacks amirite?
[11:11:28] <LindsayMac> if you'venever been - you HAVE to go .. amazingness
[11:11:37] <Andweeeee> i'm just an unemployed UI designer  that evidently doesn't understand arrays and/or :not selectors
[11:11:37] <ktstowell> i live at heres
[11:11:43] <LindsayMac> but anyone wanna help out with a mobile swipe effect? I can not get it to work
[11:11:44] <Andweeeee> is p-town philly?
[11:11:49] <ktstowell> portland
[11:11:52] <ktstowell> i think
[11:11:53] <ktstowell> lawl
[11:11:56] <LindsayMac> provincetown
[11:12:02] <LindsayMac> Provincetown MA
[11:12:07] <ktstowell> i do not kow where that is
[11:12:11] <Andweeeee> oh word. my friend maja goes to brown there
[11:12:17] <LindsayMac> Cape Cod
[11:12:19] <lvh> ktstowell: I don't see why
[11:12:20] <ktstowell> maybe ill just say PDX from now on.
[11:12:33] <lvh> ktstowell: the good browser (ie everything except IE) version is pretty darn sweet
[11:12:34] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  you know Cape Cod? Or Boston?
[11:12:45] <Andweeeee> LOL cape cod! i have best friends from there. you guys say on cape code rather than in cape cod.
[11:12:53] <lvh> ktstowell: It does exactly what it should: safely cross-domain POST with great progress control etc
[11:13:15] <ktstowell> Except in your situation - thus the failback comment, sorry to confuse.
[11:13:22] <LindsayMac> because cape cod isn't a city... so you don't live in it.. you live on it
[11:13:26] <Andweeeee> lindsaymac what's the fiddle thing for you? I'll check it out but I suck at this so i promise nothing
[11:13:31] <lvh> ktstowell: That feature actually works fine
[11:13:41] <lvh> ktstowell: I hacked some access control into my app before, and it worked fine
[11:13:45] <Andweeeee> but cape cod is a place not an object...
[11:13:53] <Andweeeee> well ok it's both.
[11:14:00] <LindsayMac> Andweeeee:  i dont have a fiddle because its kinda reliant on other things, but if you give me your IP i can show you the live example.
[11:14:02] <Andweeeee> and i guess you stand on top of it.
[11:14:03] <lvh> I hacked it back out because I thought that the CNAME + document.domain trick would work on a) all domains b) all browsers, provided I controlled all domains, which is true
[11:14:05] <ktstowell> Yeah - was my own failed attempt at making a joke due to excessive coffee consumption.
[11:14:34] <LindsayMac> Andweeeee:  no.. its kinda an object.. the Cape is the piece of land that juts out to the ocean... It's like the Rockies
[11:14:40] <lvh> and because then I'd get a regular damn form post
[11:14:48] <ktstowell> right
[11:14:50] <ktstowell> hmmm
[11:15:03] <lvh> as opposed to this redirect-to-an-html-file-that-has-some-json-in-it-somewhere-in-an-invisible-iframe
[11:15:06] <LindsayMac> anyways....
[11:15:14] <LindsayMac> now that we've gotten THAT out of the way
[11:15:16] * hlveheart slaps LindsayMac around a bit with a large trout
[11:15:20] <LindsayMac> ouch
[11:15:23] <lvh> in case you were wondering: do you need that for anything other than IE? the answer is of course NO YOU DON'T.
[11:15:24] <LindsayMac> stinky
[11:15:25] <hlveheart> love tap.
[11:15:30] <LindsayMac> lol
[11:15:34] <hlveheart> lol
[11:15:43] <ktstowell> I've had to do just that before
[11:15:44] <Andweeeee> i have an iphone, but giving out my ip address on a public forum based on the topic of the most exploitable language of all time seems like a bad idea. no offense/nothing personal, i've just been burned before
[11:15:48] <LindsayMac> So anyone wanna peek under my skirt? lol
[11:15:54] <Andweeeee> is there a link or something I can follow?
[11:15:58] <LindsayMac> Andweeeee:  you can PM me
[11:16:00] <ktstowell> wat?
[11:16:00] <b-ot> is it possible to write server in json?
[11:16:04] <Andweeeee> you pm me!
[11:16:14] <Andweeeee> can someone help me out with this? http://jsfiddle.net/Luhring/TSFbZ/39/
[11:16:25] <ktstowell> "server in json"
[11:16:41] <ktstowell> Ok - im walking away for a while.
[11:17:10] <johnkpaul> ben_alman: Do you know if there is any existing version of your debounce/throttle plugin that supports multiple timers, dependent on the arguments to the function?
[11:17:27] <ben_alman> targuments to what function?
[11:17:37] <johnkpaul> the debounced function
[11:17:56] <ben_alman> nope
[11:18:05] <ben_alman> so
[11:18:17] <sunbeam> how to have a input button having the text submitting.. for 3 secs, and then submitted! when a form was sent?
[11:18:18] <ben_alman> var fast = $.throttle(100, fn);
[11:18:25] <ben_alman> var slow = $.throttle(1000, fn);
[11:19:02] <ben_alman> var wrapper = function(state) { state ? fast() : slow(); };
[11:19:14] <johnkpaul> ah I see, no I need something different...
[11:19:25] <ben_alman> you'll have to explain
[11:19:25] <johnkpaul> I need fast(1) and fast(2) to use different timers
[11:19:47] <trailbar> so i'm loading a html file in an iframe that appears to use jquery 1.4.2
[11:19:52] <johnkpaul> so if the original fucntion was called with one parameter list, it uses one timer
[11:20:01] <johnkpaul> and if it's called with different parameters, it's uses a second timer
[11:20:07] <johnkpaul> this is for a click tracking system
[11:20:26] <ben_alman> that doesn't seem to make sense to me, if you're calling the original function you've already gotten past the throttler
[11:20:35] <johnkpaul> currently, it works such that the tracking function is called like track('click','leftbutton')
[11:20:38] <trailbar> i'm using jquery 1.7.2 myself - suspect some wierd behaviours are occurring due to both being loaded - am I sol or is there a way to get my iframe (which loads html which uses 1.4.2) working nicely
[11:20:50] <johnkpaul> ben_alman: basically, I need to curry the parmeters, and debounce _that_ function
[11:21:07] <johnkpaul> I can combine some things to make this work, I was justwondering if it was already done
[11:21:13] <ben_alman> heh don't call it currying, call it partial application
[11:21:18] <ben_alman> but nm the pedantics
[11:21:20] <johnkpaul> :) yes, need to re-read your post
[11:21:30] <ben_alman> well it seems hard to follow
[11:21:42] <johnkpaul> you mean the MSDN article?
[11:21:49] <ben_alman> the original function can't be the one that determines what timer to use, it needs to be a wrapper function
[11:22:00] <ben_alman> it = your request here
[11:22:25] <johnkpaul> yes, the wrapper fucntion needs to decide which timer
[11:22:28] <johnkpaul> based on the parameters
[11:22:38] <johnkpaul> so it's a wrapper for debounce that checks the parmeters first
[11:22:47] <ben_alman> but why not debounce it twice
[11:22:54] <ben_alman> hmmn
[11:22:59] <johnkpaul> I need to debounce _by_ the parameters
[11:23:01] <ben_alman> why do you need this?
[11:23:13] <ben_alman> you're going to need to custom write your own logic tho
[11:23:20] <johnkpaul> yeah, I know, that's what I'm planning on doing
[11:23:26] <ben_alman> at least it's super easy
[11:23:35] <johnkpaul> I need to do this because people are clicking buttons manytimes
[11:23:43] <johnkpaul> and it should only be tracked once every second or so
[11:23:55] <ben_alman> but.. ?
[11:24:03] <johnkpaul> and I can't just add track = $.debounce(1000, oldTrack)
[11:24:11] <ben_alman> why not?
[11:24:16] <johnkpaul> because that will debounce every call to track, not dependent on the params
[11:24:28] <johnkpaul> for exaple, if I call track('leftbuttonclick')
[11:24:38] <johnkpaul> I want to be able to call track('rightbuttonclick') immediately after
[11:24:43] <johnkpaul> _not_ debounced
[11:24:51] <ben_alman> var buttonClickTrack = $.debounce(1000, oldTrack); var normalTrack = $.debounce(100, oldTrack);
[11:24:59] <ben_alman> just have 2 debounced functions
[11:25:24] <ben_alman> or just call oldTrack explicitly
[11:25:39] <johnkpaul> well, the way the code is currently setup is taht there is only one entry point to tracking
[11:25:46] <johnkpaul> so I couldn't change all of teh code to use the different versions
[11:25:48] <johnkpaul> at least not easily
[11:26:31] <ben_alman> var trackWrapper = function(state) { state ? normalTrack() : oldTrack(); }; // add .apply here as needed
[11:26:32] <danzik17> johnkpaul: why not just have an event handler and within that handler, branch off of e.which ( or whatever tracks the button ).  each individual button has its own debounced function.
[11:26:36] <ben_alman> like i originally said
[11:27:14] <johnkpaul> ah, well ben_alman, there are many more than right and left click, there are hundreds of differnt options as parameters
[11:27:19] <johnkpaul> let me think about what you just said thoguh
[11:27:24] <Afflicto> I have a list of checkboxes (all dynamically fetched from DB) -- how can  I get the ones checked only via jquery? They are in the form of "<input type="checkbox" name="categories[]" value="1" /> (1 beign the category ID). thanks in advance.
[11:27:25] <ben_alman> you're missing the point
[11:27:32] <lvh> window close
[11:27:33] <ben_alman> write whatever abstraction you want into the conditional
[11:27:34] <lvh> Oops.
[11:28:01] <Afflicto> Also, it needs to be collected and sent as a _POST via ajax. so php can take it as an array of values.
[11:28:02] <NoiseEee> Afflicto: you can't get ones 'checked only via jquery' versus 'checked by some other means' unless you set up a registry to track such things
[11:28:43] <Afflicto> I guess I'll just look through them and make a new array.
[11:28:53] <fusion27> each time I change the select2 drop down on #32 I bind a new change event handler on #82, so if I change #32 3 times, I see the alert() on #83 3 times.  I'm still kinda new to .bind() not entirely sure I'm doing this the right way, but, no matter how many times the users changes #32 can I bind just 1 change event handler to #81 so the alert on #83 only shows once? http://pastie.org/4360584
[11:29:03] <Lyndon> i got it to parse thanks again ktstowell
[11:29:14] <ktstowell> Word, nice work.
[11:29:21] <ben_alman> johnkpaul: https://gist.github.com/3208977
[11:30:28] <andrewhl> how do I send data via an ajax request to a controller? Like... syntax-wise. I've got a rails app that uses jquery to trigger an ajax request. That part works... I just don't know how to package the data. https://gist.github.com/3208878 (Rails knowledge not required here, just look at the coffeescript file)
[11:31:22] <ktstowell> depends on the routing of the framework
[11:31:35] <ktstowell> but most of the time it's:
[11:31:49] <johnkpaul> ah I see what you mean ben_alman
[11:31:51] <t432> you still need some kind of limit function when retrieving data from database when using using endless scroll, right?
[11:31:54] <ben_alman> :P
[11:31:57] <ktstowell> url: " <module if not default>/controller/controller-action
[11:32:03] <johnkpaul> I'll need to add all of the logic that handles these differnet clicks into the wrapper
[11:32:15] <ben_alman> you don't really have a choice
[11:32:17] <johnkpaul> :) thank you for your permission
[11:32:20] <t432> for large scale data
[11:32:34] <ben_alman> it can't be in the debounced function, since if that's getting executed it's already too late
[11:33:09] <johnkpaul> yeah, I knew that, I was asking if there was an extension to your debounce plugin that handled it that way
[11:33:11] <andrewhl> ktstowell: in rails you just need to specify the page that is governed by the controller. In my case, url: "index" works. How can I control exactly what data it sends the controller, though?
[11:33:36] <ktstowell> thats also up to the framework
[11:33:37] <johnkpaul> it makes sense what I need to do, and where to go from here, I'll let you know what I end up with
[11:33:42] <johnkpaul> thank you ben_alman!
[11:33:46] <ben_alman> any time
[11:34:07] <ktstowell> most of them cand do /controller/controller-action/param1/value1/param2/value2  etc
[11:34:33] <ktstowell> you'll have to read up on rails docs or look on SO
[11:34:38] <ktstowell> im not a rails guy
[11:34:45] <andrewhl> ok
[11:35:27] <scalex000> hello
[11:35:33] <scalex000> hello
[11:36:04] <scalex000> I need help how to consume asp.net with jquery.
[11:36:19] <LindsayMac> anyone around here familiar with swipe.js
[11:36:54] <ktstowell> scalex000:  easy: don't use asp.net :p
[11:37:05] <scalex000> hahahahah
[11:37:09] <ktstowell> what version of asp.net are you using
[11:37:13] <scalex000> good, point
[11:37:19] <scalex000> sorry its .net
[11:37:23] <scalex000> 2012
[11:37:42] <ktstowell> (had to spend 5 months  on an asp.net team last year - was awful)
[11:37:48] <ktstowell> 20120 == 4.5?
[11:37:51] <ktstowell> erm
[11:37:54] <ktstowell> 2012*
[11:38:06] <scalex000> ktstowell, I was using .ajax(url...) I get error 500 and 403
[11:38:14] <scalex000> but I dont know why
[11:38:40] <ktstowell> so 500 means your server method is borked
[11:39:35] <ktstowell> if you're forced to use asp.net
[11:39:43] <ktstowell> use asp.net MVC3/4
[11:39:46] <ktstowell> with razor
[11:40:01] <ktstowell> then you'll have built in request routing
[11:40:15] <ktstowell> so you can do easy ajax urls with params
[11:40:31] <ktstowell> otherwise I'm pretty sure you'll have to home-roll something
[11:40:45] <ktstowell> to handle those
[11:41:49] <scalex000> ktstowell, I can call another url with ajax outside the of my site.
[11:42:55] <ktstowell> youll have to use a WSDL proxy to do that, fortunately, .net does have some easy compilers for that.
[11:48:27] <scalex000> what it mean?
[11:48:40] <scalex000> very strange for me
[11:48:54] <scalex000> I put script clause to that webservice
[11:49:06] <harryhcs> hello there! how can i check if all items in one list, is in another list ?
[11:50:20] <lathan> harryhcs, by list do you mean a javascript array, or a jQuery selection?
[11:50:36] <harryhcs> lathan, an array
[11:50:55] <lathan> harryhcs, there really isn't any jQuery feature to help.....
[11:51:21] <lathan> harryhcs, what you want is this native javascript method: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/array_indexof.htm
[11:51:50] <silverwind> Be carefulz0r... that function doesn't work on shit browsers
[11:51:58] <lathan> right
[11:52:01] <silverwind> (Read old IE)
[11:52:17] <lathan> harryhcs, so ignore that.....what you want is a 2 nested loops
[11:52:37] <lathan> harryhcs, 1 to loop through your first list, and the second to try and find the item in the other array
[11:52:59] <garciawebdev> good morning
[11:53:01] <garciawebdev> does someone remember that service that returned a dummy JSON response to every request for testing AJAX calls?
[11:53:19] <silverwind> jsfiddle does it IIRC
[11:54:40] <hlveheart> shoky, you there?
[11:55:09] <hlveheart> ah, rather. Maybe anyone in here can help me with this.
[11:58:17] <phuff> I'm trying to get an animation plugin we're using to respond to $.when() the same way the native jquery things do
[11:58:31] <phuff> But I can't figure out how to get it to trigger the .then() at the end.
[11:59:24] <lathan> what hlveheart
[11:59:26] <lathan> ?
[11:59:29] <hlveheart> hold on
[11:59:30] <hlveheart> typing it lol
[11:59:33] <silverwind> phuff: We'll need more info..
[11:59:38] <hlveheart> It's kinda a big project I'm assuming
[11:59:40] <fastfist> you guys see the internet explorer commercials?
[11:59:49] <silverwind> phuff: You use Deferred, right?
[11:59:49] <phuff> silverwind: https://gist.github.com/435054
[11:59:49] <fastfist> during the olympics
[11:59:54] <phuff> That's the plugin
[11:59:58] <phuff> But I think I see the problem.
[12:00:00] <fastfist> i was like omg lol rofl
[12:00:12] <TorpedoSkyline> fastfist no I haven't.
[12:00:14] <phuff> the this.each() happens much higher up and then uses a timeout to trigger the callback
[12:00:14] <TorpedoSkyline> I'm curious tho
[12:00:20] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/sF6R8/ ... I need to make it so that on every 5 items, it wraps them all 5 in a div with an ID "Pane1", "Pane2" "Pane3" and so on and so forth. Also when a div with a Pane# is created, I need it to add a list item to #buttonHolder with an ID of button1, button2, button3, as well as an href of the Pane1, Pane2, Pane3.
[12:00:34] <hlveheart> I don't know how else to ask such acomplicated question
[12:00:42] <hlveheart> lol
[12:00:49] <silverwind> phuff: There's no mention of Deferred in that plugin...  :/
[12:00:55] <phuff> silverwind: I know :)
[12:01:04] <phuff> silverwind: I think it was patterned after the regular jquery animate()
[12:01:33] <phuff> silverwind: but an older pre-deferred version perhaps
[12:02:01] <phuff> silverwind: But I have never dug into the animate internals before, so I'm having a hard time seeing the magic that lets $.when() work with .animate()
[12:02:05] <phuff> in the regular jquery source
[12:02:51] <lathan> harryhcs, look here: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/JwBrD/
[12:02:55] <harryhcs> lathan, thank you, I for it working with the indexOf methos
[12:03:14] <lathan> indexOf may not work on all browser....the jsfiddle will work
[12:03:57] <harryhcs> lathan, oh i c! darn! ok cool, Ill will do it like that, thats man!
[12:04:01] <hlveheart> lol
[12:04:38] <rgonzalez> i love jquery
[12:05:04] <rgonzalez> ive just reading the ook
[12:05:05] <rgonzalez> book
[12:05:24] <rgonzalez> it is incredible
[12:05:33] <smellynoser> hlveheart, Are you making JS pagination?
[12:05:38] <hlveheart> yea
[12:06:07] <shoky> phuff: $.when works with .animate() because there is a .promise() on jquery objects
[12:06:08] <ktstowell> the the divs in question are static once the page is loaded? i.e you're not adding divs on the fly?
[12:06:15] <ktstowell> so the *
[12:06:16] <hlveheart> right
[12:06:34] <hlveheart> I'm trying to make it so that it's maintainable moving forward whenever you add an item
[12:06:35] <ktstowell> kk - what yer trying to do then isn't so cimplicated, but
[12:06:39] <phuff> shoky: Got a function or place I can look at in the jquery source to see how that works?
[12:06:44] <hlveheart> it's probably not the best way to do it
[12:06:45] <hlveheart>  I know
[12:06:47] <hlveheart> :
[12:06:50] <ktstowell> if you approach in a procedural manner it can get bloated and tedious
[12:07:16] <hlveheart> how do you suggest i do it?
[12:07:18] <shoky> phuff: first of all see http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[12:07:47] <ktstowell> well since you don't have to keep track of divs
[12:07:52] <shoky> (not to learn what a promise is, but to learn of .promise() method)
[12:07:54] <phuff> shoky: okay.  (I know how promises work, I'm just trying to see how jquery uses them internally to make $.when() work)
[12:08:00] <shoky> ^^
[12:08:23] <smellynoser> Is there not already pagination in jQuery UI?
[12:08:30] <phuff> shoky: Right.  I've been looking at it.
[12:08:39] <hlveheart> I'm using bootstrap, there's pagination in there.
[12:08:44] <ktstowell> the only thing you really need to keep track of is naming collision
[12:09:14] <ktstowell> why use another pagination when you can make one yourself and become a moar ubers developer ? :D
[12:09:14] <hlveheart> The pagination is already done. I'd jsfiddle a live example but it'd be tedious lol
[12:09:48] <hlveheart> basically, I have the divs currently static, separating every 10 items
[12:09:56] <hlveheart> but every single time I add an item, I have to manually push everything down
[12:10:00] <hlveheart> it's a pain lol
[12:10:12] <ktstowell> so you are adding divs on teh fly then
[12:10:17] <hlveheart> right
[12:10:21] <ktstowell> gah
[12:10:23] <hlveheart> lol
[12:10:29] <ktstowell> ok
[12:10:29] <hlveheart> bad way to do it?
[12:10:36] <ktstowell> no no
[12:10:44] <ktstowell> just requirements have changed
[12:10:48] <hlveheart> ahh
[12:10:51] <shoky> phuff: the deferred is first set up here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L79
[12:11:20] <hlveheart> Let me link up a live example real quick of my current code so you have an idea of how many items we're talking
[12:11:23] <hlveheart> lol
[12:11:26] <ktstowell> you need then at least two abstracted functions - and this isnt even touching visual DOM manipulation
[12:11:37] <ktstowell> one to keep track of added divs
[12:11:46] <ktstowell> and once it reaches a predifined ceiling
[12:11:55] <phuff> shoky: Ah, interesting.  I don't see that in my version of jquery animate.
[12:11:57] <ktstowell> call another one to gorup and name divs and wrappers
[12:12:00] <phuff> shoky: Maybe it's older code?
[12:12:16] <ktstowell> and buttons
[12:12:26] <ktstowell> can you also remove divs on teh fly?
[12:12:42] <shoky> phuff: $.fn.animate creates a new Animation object
[12:12:42] <hlveheart> wouldn't need to
[12:12:53] <shoky> phuff: most of the code is in the Animation object
[12:12:53] <hlveheart> One sec. Let me upload this live example
[12:12:58] <hlveheart> Links won't work but you'll get the idea
[12:13:06] <phuff> shoky: Yeah we must be using an older version
[12:13:25] <phuff> shoky: It just has a .fn.animate appears to just have a doAnimation() sub function in this version
[12:13:48] <phuff> shoky: thought it still appears to be working with $.when() I think
[12:14:18] <phuff> shoky: We're still on 1.7.1
[12:14:41] <shoky> phuff: then look in the .promise() method
[12:14:48] <shoky> $.fn.promise
[12:16:36] <phuff> shoky: Okay, I see that.  I think maybe I should just be creating a new deferred, though, but I'm not sure how to return it from the function since it's currently returning the jquery object.
[12:17:24] <shoky> phuff: if you want to make something respond to $.when  you'll need a deferred, yeah
[12:17:43] <shoky> well, you'd probably want a deferred, that is ;p
[12:17:50] <phuff> So, how do I return the jquery object so that I can chain, but still make it respond to the deferred I guess is the piece I'm missing.
[12:18:06] <shoky> ah
[12:18:10] <phuff> or rather, still have it handle the deferred properly so that $.when can find the deferred I create.
[12:18:42] <shoky> i'm not sure ;p
[12:19:13] <phuff> Okay :)
[12:19:21] <phuff> that's the part I was hpoing to understand by going over the animate source
[12:19:25] <ajpiano> phuff: var foo = $(".foo").animate(({ }), promise = foo.promise();  $.when( promise ).then( function() { foo.addClass("done") })
[12:19:44] <shoky> he wants his own .animate tho
[12:19:52] <shoky> i think?
[12:19:54] <phuff> Yeah, we're using the aza raskin css animation plugin
[12:20:01] <phuff> That uses css transitions to animate instead of jquery animations
[12:20:17] <ajpiano> ohh
[12:20:20] <phuff> This one here: https://gist.github.com/435054
[12:20:24] <ajpiano> you're definitely going to need a wrapping deferred
[12:20:32] <ajpiano> and then to bind to transitionEnd events and stuff, i would presume
[12:20:33] <phuff> But the pattern it's setup to use is just passing in a callback function
[12:20:57] <shoky> phuff: i think it'd be much simpler if you just decide not so support chaining
[12:21:12] <phuff> shoky: For sure, then I just can return the deferred, right? :)
[12:21:20] <shoky> and return a promise/your own object that implements promise
[12:21:27] <phuff> Right
[12:21:30] <shoky> phuff: best to return its promise, but yeah
[12:21:36] <LindsayMac> I am having a HECK of a time using swipe.js and could use a little help.. the only issue is that for me to show you my code i need to give you access to the live site via IP
[12:21:38] <phuff> Ah yeah, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, I see that.
[12:23:41] <shoky> or, you could just have your own $.fn.myAnimPromise
[12:23:54] <shoky> that returns the promise.
[12:24:04] <shoky> while $.fn.myAnim can still be chained
[12:24:06] <shoky> dunno.
[12:24:07] <phuff> shoky; That's true.
[12:24:18] <phuff> shoky: That's what I wanted to dig into animate() because clearly its' doing this already, right? :)
[12:24:48] <shoky> mm yea but it's all coupled with the .queue stuff i think, i always get tangled when i try to make sense of it ;)
[12:25:04] <phuff> Ah yeah.  That's what the .promise() code refers to :)
[12:30:52] <LindsayMac> anyone wanna give a helping hand in regards to this swipe.js issue? It seems like its not calculating the amount of distance to slide left..
[12:47:11] <cheebs_> hey guys, i'm trying to append a dom object to an existing element, then select that element.  it doesn't seem to be working.  any ideas? (http://pastebin.com/4JziGPXW)
[12:48:30] <ajpiano> .after returns what it was called on, not the new element
[12:49:02] <ajpiano> cheebs_: $("<select>").html( filterKeyData.optoins ).attr("id", "event_filtervalueselect").insertAfter("#event_filtervalue"{)
[12:49:15] <ajpiano> you don't put a # in an id when you are setting something's id
[12:50:43] <scar> what would be the best method to creating a timer-- lets say every 10 minutes if the page is still open (obviously the javascript/jquery would need to be counting) it will check a .php script to see if true or false is returned, and if true, then make a noise?
[12:50:56] <cheebs_> ajpiano: thanks, i'll give that a try
[12:50:59] <ravenzz> you would save a reference to that object also, so you don't have to select it again in the future

[12:58:09] <ajustrun> hey guys, i just finished my website. i wanted to thank everyone here for helping me learn how to code! been an awesome 8 weeks for me! my site is up at http://airbrush.io if anyone wants to check it out
[12:58:20] <jonathancutrell> ajustrun: congrats.
[12:58:21] <AMcP_> ryanneufeld: Deferreds
[12:58:28] <ajustrun> thanks jonathancutrell!

[12:59:58] <jonathancutrell> ryanneufeld AMcP_ anybody have a link to that? :)
[12:59:59] <ajpiano> yeah, that's one i can't wait to have online :p
[13:00:09] <jonathancutrell> I suppose that's a no.

[13:00:29] <jonathancutrell> ryanneufeld: Heh. Event.
[13:01:03] <lathan> spanglesontoast, I suppose you could use a hash tag to save the id of which field was focused, and refocus it when you see that hash tag
[13:01:10] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: it looks like the SF events page is down, is there an archive?
[13:01:33] <ajpiano> http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/ is down?
[13:01:46] <jonathancutrell> not for me.
[13:02:17] <ryanneufeld> events.jquery.com used to link to it
[13:02:18] <ryanneufeld> lol
[13:02:23] <ryanneufeld> so I was being a noob
[13:02:32] <ryanneufeld> or rather, just didn't know the url
[13:03:03] <ravenzz> do you use to upload the talk video somewhere?
[13:03:07] <ravenzz> +s
[13:04:13] <ajpiano> ravenzz: we are going to but they aren't up yet
[13:04:32] <ravenzz> will they be free?
[13:04:37] <ajpiano> yes
[13:04:41] <ravenzz> ok cool
[13:05:04] <hlveheart> lol.
[13:05:05] <jonathancutrell> they better be.
[13:05:12] <jonathancutrell> :)
[13:05:21] <ajpiano> exactly ;)
[13:05:53] <ryanneufeld> jquery !== OReily
[13:08:22] <jonathancutrell> jquery != OReilly, either.
[13:08:49] <lathan> ?bot commands
[13:08:50] <bot-t> jQuery bot commands: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_bot_commands
[13:21:51] <jrockjiggz> so, if i receive my ajax in a variable called data, can't i: $('body').html(data);
[13:22:48] <jrockjiggz> what about: $('body').html( data.find('#someId') );
[13:23:02] <Jon47> jrockjiggz: you could..but if you're just replacing the entire page why don't you just do a standard hyperlink
[13:23:36] <lathan> jrockjiggz, and it would be $('body').html($(data).find('#someId'))
[13:23:46] <lathan> jrockjiggz, but his point about a hyperlink is valid
[13:23:59] <lathan> jrockjiggz, what benefit is it to do it whith ajax when the whole page is replaced?
[13:24:13] <jrockjiggz> yea i'm just trying to identify my problem being theoretical.. i have what you wrote but it will not work
[13:24:45] <jrockjiggz> lathan, i'm trying to emulate fragment ajax
[13:24:58] <lathan> jrockjiggz, you mean what .load does for you?
[13:25:00] <lathan> ?load @ jrist
[13:25:01] <bot-t> jrist, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[13:25:04] <lathan> sorry jrist...
[13:25:07] <lathan> jrockjiggz, ^^^^
[13:25:12] <jrist> no worries lahwran
[13:25:12] <lathan> oops
[13:25:14] <jrist> haha
[13:25:15] <jrist> oh man
[13:25:16] <lathan> ?load-ajx
[13:25:17] <bot-t> lathan, Ajax - The jQuery library has a full suite of AJAX capabilities. The functions and methods therein allow us to load data from the server without a browser page refresh. http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[13:25:17] <jrist> double messup :)
[13:25:19] <jrockjiggz> lol
[13:25:21] <lathan> ?load-ajax
[13:25:22] <bot-t> lathan, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[13:25:25] <lathan> there ^
[13:25:29] <lathan> ?load-ajax fragment
[13:25:30] <bot-t> lathan, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[13:26:01] <jrockjiggz> lathan: i have a custom function that loads ajax through an ajax manager. i'm parsing the url extracting the fragment, and simply:  target.html( $(data).find(fragment) );
[13:26:30] <lathan> okay...with a target object that makes more sense
[13:27:23] <jrockjiggz> if I console.log(data); i get the entire response.   if i console.log(framgent); i get ' #loadDiv'..  so the variables exist..
[13:27:44] <jrockjiggz> i have a <div id="loadDiv"></div> in the response
[13:28:08] <jrockjiggz> i swear...
[13:28:18] <shoky> .find looks for descendants of the root element
[13:28:24] <shoky> (not for the root itself..)
[13:28:52] <shoky> or is that not the root, sorry
[13:29:09] <lathan> ?filter @ jrockjiggz
[13:29:10] <bot-t> jrockjiggz, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[13:29:46] <lathan> ?eval $('#div').find('#div')
[13:29:50] <bot-t> lathan: []
[13:30:01] <lathan> ?eval $('#div').length
[13:30:02] <bot-t> lathan: 0
[13:30:04] <shoky> well..
[13:30:11] <jrockjiggz> lol, shoky. i wrapped the element in a plain <div></div> and it find it!
[13:30:16] <lathan> yep
[13:30:18] <shoky> there you go ;P
[13:30:19] <jrockjiggz> *found
[13:30:21] <lathan> jrockjiggz, take off the wrapper and use filter
[13:30:23] <jrockjiggz> so annoying..
[13:30:27] <jrockjiggz> ah
[13:30:47] <shoky> that's what .load does too, btw
[13:31:05] <scalex000> shoky, have you calll webservicer from jquery

[13:34:31] <scalex000> shoky, its server problem.  :(
[13:34:35] <shoky> ;(
[13:34:50] <scalex000> shoky, any idea?
[13:34:55] <shoky> ...
[13:35:06] <shoky> how about, make your server NOT spit oout a 403?
[13:35:11] <shoky> i think that will take care of it
[13:35:13] <shoky> :\
[13:35:37] <scalex000> shoky, spit out :P
[13:36:03] <shoky> spfhh

[13:47:51] <ABEC5> hey all $('.whatever_class').live('click', function(element) { //need to .hide the div containing element }); little help for a newb?
[13:48:30] <shoky> ABEC5: $(this).closest('div').hide()
[13:50:16] <ABEC5> shoky: not working for me...
[13:50:27] <ABEC5> isn't that dynamically creating the selector?
[13:50:37] <shoky> what selector?
[13:50:41] <ABEC5> this
[13:50:46] <shoky> that's not a selector
[13:50:51] <shoky> it's a reference to the clicked object
[13:50:54] <Andweeeee> please can someone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/Luhring/TSFbZ/39/
[13:50:57] <shoky> clicked element*
[13:51:22] <ABEC5> hmm ok
[13:51:24] <shoky> ABEC5: and i thought you wanted it to be dynamic..
[13:51:39] <ABEC5> correct, i'm obviously doing something wrong...
[13:51:44] <Andweeeee> i've been trying to figure it out for seriously a day and i don't understand what I'm not understanding about arrays. my questions are in the js script http://jsfiddle.net/TSFbZ/34/
[13:51:46] <shoky> yerp
[13:51:46] <xec_> Andweeeee: TL;DR -- care to boil it down?
[13:51:57] <shoky> hiya xec
[13:52:03] * xec_ waves at shoky
[13:52:09] <shoky> o/
[13:52:38] <xec_> ?demo @ ABEC5
[13:52:39] <bot-t> ABEC5, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:53:00] <ABEC5> will do...
[13:53:24] <Andweeeee> i don't know how to ask the question that's what my problem is. if you just read the //******* paragraph that's what i really need explained
[13:54:07] <ktstowell> Andweeeee: it looks like your getElementsbyClassName isn't returning anything
[13:54:20] <xec_> ABEC5: from what you wrote, the snippet shoky gave you should be what you need. .closest() will search upwards the dom tree to find the closest ancestor div to whatever you clicked
[13:54:37] <ktstowell> Andweeeee:  aaaand
[13:54:47] <ktstowell> albumArtArray = albumArt[i];
[13:54:51] <Andweeeee> oh im an idiot sorry i posted the wrong one http://jsfiddle.net/Luhring/TSFbZ/39/
[13:54:53] <ktstowell> this is incorrect
[13:55:02] <Andweeeee> im so sorry.
[13:55:17] <xec_> Andweeeee: your paragraph starts with "so those are the goals," ..?
[13:55:18] <ktstowell> albumArtArray[i] = albumArt[i]; or using .push() would work
[13:55:53] <ktstowell> that's okay my correction still stands
[13:56:01] <Andweeeee> in this one the 3 questions are the first one.
[13:56:10] <Andweeeee> ok. cool;
[13:56:17] <ktstowell> albumArtArray = albumArt[i]; dod you see why that's incorrect?
[13:56:21] <ktstowell> do*
[13:56:34] <bemson> does jquery somehow get the unload event to work in Opera?
[13:56:35] <shoky> tl;dr indeed
[13:56:37] <Andweeeee> OH ok it needed the [i]
[13:56:51] <Andweeeee> is that what you're saying?
[13:56:58] <ktstowell> yep
[13:57:02] <ktstowell> or
[13:57:29] <ktstowell> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_push.asp
[13:58:11] <xec_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push
[13:58:18] <Andweeeee> yeah i don't understand why but the .join() .push() and the other .__() methods (if thats the right word) weren't working when i tried to use them
[13:58:36] <xec_> ktstowell, http://w3fools.com/
[13:59:20] <xec_> Andweeeee: what exactly is your question?
[13:59:43] <shoky> how do i made this list of goals come true
[13:59:51] <shoky> oops
[13:59:54] <Andweeeee> no it's more about arrays
[14:00:34] <derekpioneer> w3schools is helpful most of the time
[14:00:47] <NoiseEee> and wrong a lot of the tim
[14:00:48] <NoiseEee> e
[14:00:50] <ktstowell> xec_:  yeah, i don't go there for personal reference, but i wasn't worried about w3's definition of push
[14:00:50] <NoiseEee> take your chance!
[14:00:59] <derekpioneer> why are they #1 in google?
[14:01:05] <derekpioneer> for everything
[14:01:20] <shoky> because of people like you ;p
[14:01:22] <ktstowell> b/c noobs put them there, lol.
[14:01:26] <xec_> ktstowell: yeah, but as a support channel we should strive to avoid it so beginners won't end up there
[14:01:26] <NoiseEee> because people don't know the difference, and they get a lot of clicks.
[14:01:26] <Andweeeee> i just don't understand what it is i'm doing that is causing them to not do what i think they're doing. because i don't understand what's happening, i havent been able to form the question. ktstowell helped with the albumArtArray[i] = albumArt[i]; thing- it was a simple thing that i missed that i wasnt adding the [i]
[14:01:48] <derekpioneer> xec_: yeah that's true
[14:01:52] <ktstowell> xec_:  agreed.
[14:02:25] <Andweeeee> but there are 3 requests for explanations in here: http://jsfiddle.net/Luhring/TSFbZ/39/
[14:02:51] <Andweeeee> the 3 at the top are what i don't understand and the 4 goals are to explain what it is im trying to do and why
[14:03:11] <xec_> Andweeeee: that fiddle is way too large. if you have 3 questions, make 3 fiddles
[14:03:31] <xec_> Andweeeee: each one should have as few lines of code as possible
[14:03:48] <Andweeeee> not asking for anyone to do the work for me, just asking for resources or something. ktstowell helped out a lot.
[14:03:51] <xec_> Andweeeee: that way we know exactly what you're taking about
[14:04:14] <tyoc213> Hi there how do I select input text wich are editable and in other select inputs not editable?
[14:04:17] <Andweeeee> that's why it's as large as it is though!
[14:04:21] <xec_> Andweeeee: at the moment all you can get is (qualified) guesses
[14:07:54] <Andweeeee> i spent like an hour trying to comment everything so people can see the exact process but i'll try to split the 3 things up if it'll help. i just was trying to include all the information so it'd be easier to see the context.  and theres a TON i left out.
[14:08:21] <Andweeeee> thanks for looking it over in the first place, y'all rule.
[14:11:25] <lahwran> I was pinged?
[14:12:44] <shoky> Andweeeee: FWIW, having a hidden div that you're going to show later on is NOT a ghetto hack :P
[14:13:05] <ABEC5> alright, here's my issue: http://jsfiddle.net/4pL9V/1/ the hide method isn't working inside the getJSON call... probably some newb thing...
[14:13:55] <Andweeeee> lol. i just figured there had to be a more efficient way of doing that
[14:14:20] <shoky> ABEC5: 'this' changes inside the getJSON callback
[14:14:42] <ktstowell> this isn't the same
[14:14:47] <ktstowell> ^^
[14:15:13] <xec_> this matters
[14:15:15] <ABEC5> ok, so i'm going about the check seeing if the post was successful or not...
[14:15:20] <ABEC5> the wrong way
[14:15:29] <shoky> ABEC5: so you need to save/cache it before the getJSON: http://jsfiddle.net/4pL9V/3/
[14:15:30] <ktstowell> console.log(this) often so you know it's pointing to
[14:15:35] <diamonds> what's a good way to test the elements in a STRING containing som ehtml?
[14:15:59] <ktstowell> yes
[14:16:19] <ABEC5> shoky: excellent, a simple answer... thanks :)
[14:16:20] <ktstowell> thats whay on many object methods you'll see something like "var self = this;" repended t them
[14:16:25] <ktstowell> prepended*
[14:16:56] <Andweeeee> real quick- does anyone else in here use aptana studio as an editor? if so do you know how to get multiline comments to fold? they don't have the option it looks like
[14:17:41] <ktstowell> wasn't a fan of aptana
[14:17:51] <ktstowell> vim or sublime text 2 ++
[14:20:57] <Andweeeee> yeah i wasn't at first either but it grew on me.
[14:21:21] <Andweeeee> it was actually kind of a bastard setting everything up, but once i got it, it's pretty cool
[14:37:53] <OomElvis> q: i want to store a div in a variable and then when going through DOM, compare dom elements with the element in the variable to see if theyre the same
[14:38:26] <OomElvis> any ideas?
[14:40:13] <diamonds> anyone know how to turn a DocumentFragment back into its HTML?
[14:44:00] <dogarrhea2> the fuck? Larry Wachowski is now a woman?
[14:44:23] <dogarrhea2> i guess he unplugged the the matrix cord in his pants XD
[14:45:08] <xec_> OomElvis: you can just use === to see if you have the same DOM element
[14:45:23] <shoky> diamonds: var d = document.createElement('div'); d.appendChild( someFragment ); d.innerHTML
[14:45:48] <OomElvis> xec: thanks
[14:46:28] <xec_> OomElvis: would only work on native dom element mind you, not a jquery collection. http://jsfiddle.net/JbwfG/
[14:46:36] <diamonds> shoky: thank you!
[14:46:55] <diamonds> sucks that browser API is so sucky that that hack is required, but it does the trick
[14:47:04] <shoky> it's not a hack
[14:47:09] <dogarrhea2> hrm. how do you debug an iframe in firefox/chrome?
[14:47:13] <shoky> a document fragment doesn't have HTML.
[14:47:15] <dogarrhea2> developer tools only sees the top level page
[14:47:15] <shoky> (i think)
[14:47:35] <xec_> dogarrhea2: you can use cd() to change environment iirc
[14:47:53] <dogarrhea2> cd()?
[14:48:04] <pifantastic> dogarrhea2: In the bottom of Developer Tools you can switch between frames
[14:48:19] <pifantastic> http://grimhappy.com/i/21da1ff.png
[14:49:23] <xec_> dogarrhea2: yes. like cd(myIframeWindow) would give you access to the iframe's environment instead of the toplevel document
[14:49:23] <diamonds> shoky: I mean creating a dummy elem just to stick the fragment in and pull it back out
[14:49:58] <shoky> diamonds: a fragment is just an object in memory of DOM nodes. HTML has nothing to do with it (yet)
[14:50:09] <dogarrhea2> cd is undefined
[14:50:17] <dogarrhea2> i got to it via the other thing
[14:50:25] <diamonds> shoky: I believe it's a Node
[14:50:40] <diamonds> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/DocumentFragment "See Node for a listing of its properties, constants and methods."
[14:50:48] <xec_> dogarrhea2: i assumed you were using firebug https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Cd
[14:51:06] <diamonds> so it has child nodes.  I guess those aren't HTML but I only tenously grasp the difference
[14:51:07] <shoky> diamonds: yes, a DOM node
[14:51:20] <shoky> if you go to https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Node
[14:51:27] <shoky> you won't find any mention of innerHTML or HTML
[14:52:05] <shoky> it's just an object in memory with various fields denoting the properties of the node
[15:03:13] <autolycus> I am using data tablesand I want to delete the rowdoes any one work with data tables here
[15:24:18] <scriptor> given something like $('<div><i>foo</i><div><b>bar</b>') is there any way to only get the top-level elements? In this case only the div and the b
[15:30:10] <scriptor> never mind, .contents() does give the top-level ones

[15:35:52] <mischief> how would i use a javascript value in a jqeury attribute selector
[15:38:01] <dabear> autolycus: after a quick look at the api at http://datatables.net/api, you should be able to fnDraw inside a fnDeleteRow
[15:38:41] <autolycus> I am using the editable and this is how I delete   sDeleteURL:"DeleteData.php",
[15:38:48] <autolycus> so I am not sure how to add that code here

[15:50:07] <mischief> :(
[15:50:27] <shoky> o well.
[15:50:42] <ktstowell> LindsayMac:  beause jqmobile uses the data- html5 api for it's parsing
[15:51:10] <dogarrhea2> cd(iframeidwithoutquotesorwhat) ?
[15:51:14] <ktstowell> data-role="page" tells jq mobile to treat that as a hwhole page
[15:51:31] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  ok.. interesting. I have never used it but making a mobile theme for my site and tryign to work out a little hidden menu button
[15:51:51] <ktstowell> jq mobile actually requires very little scripting to get up and running
[15:52:07] <ktstowell> the first step is getting familiar with recognized data- values
[15:52:08] <zorph> initself, well u can't test the document.write('<script.... using jsfiddle..
[15:52:09] <LindsayMac> ok...
[15:52:13] <ktstowell> they have them on their site
[15:52:19] <dogarrhea2> too bad mobile web development is pointless until browser fragmentation and useless bugs don't get fixed
[15:52:22] <zorph> initself, paste your actual html script
[15:52:27] <LindsayMac> I am going to look into it further. I've used UI but I am going to poke through the site more
[15:52:51] <dogarrhea2> the cd command in firefox did not work.
[15:53:00] <ktstowell> i disagree dogarrhea2 most mobile browsers have better html5 support than desktop ones over a wide user base
[15:53:21] <LindsayMac> mobile development is pointless?? hahaha
[15:53:34] <ktstowell> he mean non-native app mobile development
[15:53:37] <ktstowell> means*
[15:53:41] <dogarrhea2> ktstowell: why doesn't html5 audio,scrolltop, and a whole slew of 2+ year old bugs get fixed
[15:54:13] <dogarrhea2> the onended event or whatever it's called is totallly broken in android 2.3 and earlier
[15:54:27] <dogarrhea2> sounds only play once and neve rplay again on android browsers etc etc
[15:54:29] <mischief> sigh, nobody know how to use a js variable in a jquery selector? :s
[15:54:32] <LindsayMac> browser apps are pretty big right now.. i mean, even to just start with an iphone web app and move forward to different browsers you would be better pressed than not having one at all..
[15:54:34] <dogarrhea2> i'd say support is pretty terribad at the moment
[15:54:50] <zorph> mischief, that's easy
[15:55:03] <mischief> it doesn't seem to be
[15:55:05] <mischief> how do i do it?
[15:55:11] <dogarrhea2> it's still really bad. you can't scrolltop a div ? that's basic html right?
[15:55:13] <LindsayMac> not to mention people will almost ALWAYS have the most recent versions of browsers...
[15:55:19] <ktstowell> you can't combine a js var and string selector will always throw a parse error
[15:55:22] <zorph> $("#myid"+varHere).val()
[15:55:24] <ktstowell> you can use it by itself
[15:55:26] <LindsayMac> so even if it is REALLY bad, the majority of people will update as soon as they can
[15:55:42] <dogarrhea2> LindsayMac, assuming people like to brick their phones on nandroid
[15:55:42] <mischief> zorph: how do i select all elements containing a js value in the attribute
[15:55:51] <dogarrhea2> the browser is intrinsically tied to the operating system
[15:56:08] <LindsayMac> dogarrhea2:  upgrading android os bricks them?
[15:56:16] <mischief> zorph: i.e $('*[name=<insert js value>]').click(function() {})
[15:56:22] <dogarrhea2> LindsayMac, users want to go through that trouble to get a working browser?
[15:56:28] <ktstowell> i saw some wicked mobile demos at oscon this year, some used sound, ill have to pull up the slide decks and look at the code samples on how they got them to work
[15:56:37] <zorph> mischief, http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[15:56:47] <LindsayMac> no but MOST mobile users, especially iphone, but others as well, upgrade as soon as an OS upgrade is available or pretty soon
[15:56:55] <mischief> zorph: i have seen this example
[15:56:59] <ktstowell> b/c in various different lectures it was stated that mobile devies have better html5 supprot than most desktops
[15:57:05] <mischief> zorph: how do you replace "man" with a js value in that example?
[15:57:06] <LindsayMac> and MINIMALLY will only have their outdated OS for a year max befor ethey are due for an upgrade
[15:57:22] <zorph> concatenate
[15:57:30] <mischief> $('input[name*=someJSVar]')
[15:57:35] <LindsayMac> people buy new cell pohnes on an average of every 1.5 years so you will rarely have a user that is using their phone to browse web apps that has an antiquated browser.
[15:57:44] <zorph> no..that's a string..not a var
[15:57:48] <mischief> zorph: could you provide an example?
[15:58:00] <dogarrhea2> ice cream shitwich was not really available for even the galaxy s2 until a few months ago
[15:58:09] <ktstowell> $('input[name="+jsvar+"]')
[15:58:09] <zorph> $('input[name*="'+var+'"]')
[15:58:09] <LindsayMac> mobile web is the future for a lot of web-based application sites... its not as much overhead as native
[15:58:10] <dogarrhea2> "custom rom"
[15:58:17] <ktstowell> first!
[15:58:32] <dogarrhea2> keyword: future
[15:58:47] <dogarrhea2> i want it to work. now. but android is like ie6
[15:59:11] <LindsayMac> So you think you should not develop for web apps until its here?? It's the people who are developing for it now that will be the pros when it is fully rolled out / supported.
[15:59:16] <dogarrhea2> most of the bug tracking items on google's bug tracker have about 50% comments like "still no status?"
[15:59:32] <LindsayMac> well thats why the iphone kills android
[15:59:52] <LindsayMac> their browser has shown to be much more stable as far as I have read and experienced
[15:59:56] <dogarrhea2> LindsayMac, no, you won't be an expert.  no one writes native javascript anymore. that's why there's jquery
[16:00:15] <dogarrhea2> no one cares if you can detect which version of xmlhttprequest to use
[16:00:21] <ktstowell> i only use jQuery for selectors and ajax
[16:00:24] <LindsayMac> what are you talking about? You aren't even making sense a tthis point
[16:00:32] <dogarrhea2> i'm making perfect sense.
[16:00:44] <snover> dogarrhea2: no on writes native javascript anymore false.
[16:00:45] <dogarrhea2> how is hacking an unusable old technology make you an expert in the future
[16:00:47] <snover> one*
[16:00:58] <snover> jquery is not a replacement for javascript
[16:01:00] <dogarrhea2> ok over general, but it's not as common
[16:01:01] <LindsayMac> if you're writing a web app for the WEB that works seamlessly on iphones NOW, when the "future" is here (as you said) they will be much further ahead than you are
[16:01:13] <LindsayMac> javascript is old technology?
[16:01:14] <ktstowell> noobs just starting out will tend to only use jQuery
[16:01:15] <initself> where's the download link for this plugin?
[16:01:16] <initself> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/node/345/release
[16:01:17] <ktstowell> or people in marketing
[16:01:18] <LindsayMac> lol.. now i smell trolling
[16:01:18] <initself> i can't find it!
[16:01:32] <dogarrhea2> you'll definitely have maintenance nightmares
[16:01:41] <LindsayMac> even this newb knows that's completely ridiculous
[16:01:46] <LindsayMac> lol dogarrhea2 ok...
[16:01:54] <dogarrhea2> so, you're happy when you see browser selection code or other such hacks?
[16:01:59] <mischief> zorph: it doesn't work as indended
[16:02:02] <ktstowell> maintenance nightmares can happen in any codebase
[16:02:07] <snover> maintenance nightmares come from people that think jquery can solve their architectural problems
[16:02:14] <zorph> mischief, paste ur code
[16:02:20] <ktstowell> it's up to devleopers to write maintainable, decoupled, well-documented code
[16:02:22] <LindsayMac> snover:  +1
[16:02:23] <dogarrhea2> still, when you have hack code, you don't wnat to see it
[16:02:33] <zorph> bpaste.net
[16:02:35] <dogarrhea2> if(ie 5 or ie 6 or whatever) you don't want to see it
[16:02:40] <LindsayMac> dogarrhea2:  again.. not making sense.
[16:02:45] <dogarrhea2> how am i not making sense
[16:02:50] <dogarrhea2> there's this kind of code in mobile dev right now
[16:02:58] <LindsayMac> because what does that have to do with JAVASCRIPT being outdated?!
[16:03:00] <dogarrhea2> detect if mobile device. detect if safari
[16:03:09] <LindsayMac> and....?
[16:03:09] <zorph> mischief, replace "name" with your actual attribute name..
[16:03:13] <dogarrhea2> you're saying mobile dev is so great
[16:03:17] <LindsayMac> and....
[16:03:24] <dogarrhea2> you're using these kinds of hacks
[16:03:26] <LindsayMac> what does browser detection have to do with it?
[16:03:33] <dogarrhea2> just like ie6 era
[16:03:36] <LindsayMac> how is browser detection a HACK????
[16:03:36] <zorph> mischief, $("element[attr*='something']")
[16:03:44] <ktstowell> because browsers lie
[16:03:51] <ktstowell> use feature detection instead
[16:04:00] <ktstowell> and be clean about it and use modernizr or something
[16:04:01] <LindsayMac> are you saying that because you want to detect for browsers you are using antiquated methods? Give me a break
[16:04:03] <ktstowell> or $.support
[16:04:28] <dogarrhea2> yes.. do that today without a library and people will fire you (for new development)
[16:04:35] <dogarrhea2> on desktop browsers at least
[16:04:37] <LindsayMac> the purpose NOW to detect for browsers is because there is a major difference between mobile and desktop browsing that did not exist before
[16:04:38] <mischief> zorph: i did.
[16:04:51] <LindsayMac> Do waht?? detect a browser?
[16:04:57] <LindsayMac> you make very little sense very often
[16:05:04] <ktstowell> dont browser detect, screen query, and if a smaller res is matched, serve up mobile site
[16:05:10] <zorph> mischief, please bpaste.net
[16:05:11] <initself> can someone help me find the download lnk to think plugin?
[16:05:12] <initself> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/node/345/release
[16:05:15] <initself> i can't find it anywhere!
[16:05:17] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  thats what i've done
[16:05:19] <dogarrhea2> stop saying that and please read the arguments.  who wants to do mobile device detection
[16:05:21] <ktstowell> kk
[16:05:27] <ktstowell> that's not browser detection
[16:05:29] <dogarrhea2> let's face it, android html5 support is soo bad
[16:05:33] <LindsayMac> but i have occasionally made unique themes for sites where i used browser detection
[16:05:40] <dogarrhea2> it's not "wave of the future blah blah" it's now.
[16:05:42] <ktstowell> borswer is where you actually sniff teh user agent
[16:05:47] <LindsayMac> So that makes coding for the web useless?
[16:05:51] <ktstowell> and those headers can be straight up falsified
[16:05:59] <mischief> zorph: it works now :D
[16:06:03] <initself> dude, the download link is non existant
[16:06:04] <LindsayMac> ktstowell:  i know.. i'm using a falsified one now to test my code
[16:06:07] <mischief> $('*[data-like-tag*="' + likeData.tag + '"]').text(likeCount);
[16:06:10] <ktstowell> lol
[16:06:40] <LindsayMac> for a restaurant website.. im not worried about yuppies catching a early bird special hacking into the site and viewing it with the wrong user agent
[16:06:43] <codepython777> I'm planning to read a jquery book -- which one do you guys recommend for beginners -- "Learning jQuery -3rd edition" or "jquery cookbook" ?
[16:06:47] <zorph> mischief, what's the star at the beginning for?
[16:06:58] <LindsayMac> BUT if they did.. it looks "ok" on desktop.. just narrow.. ha
[16:07:02] <dogarrhea2> LindsayMac: "hacking into the site" lol
[16:07:03] <mischief> zorph: any element
[16:07:08] <mischief> no particular html tag
[16:07:09] <codepython777> shoky: any recommendations? :) -- for the book question.
[16:07:19] <LindsayMac> ?
[16:07:54] <dogarrhea2> let's face it, android mobile development is not robust
[16:08:04] <codepython777> I also could read jquery- novoice to ninja -- which one do you guys recommend for beginners -- "Learning jQuery -3rd edition" or "jquery cookbook"  or the first one?
[16:08:10] <LindsayMac> let's face it.. dogarrhea2 has one little catch phrase he picked up on the web somewhere
[16:08:23] <biodegabriel> Hi Guys, I'm having a real hard time iterating over some checkboxes and executing two different things depending on whether .prop("checked" is true. Here's my code. Any advice is appreciated! :) http://jsfiddle.net/qnVVV/
[16:08:28] <dogarrhea2> what works on safari on ios devices is entirely different from android, either way, it's like supporting multiple browsers. it's THAT nightmare all over again
[16:08:30] <LindsayMac> codepython777:  there's loads of free resources on the net
[16:08:57] <codepython777> LindsayMac: I like reading a book -- and as you know, I know nothing about jquery, except for asking for help here :)
[16:09:12] <dogarrhea2> what's the point of native apps if you can do everything the same on mobile browsers.
[16:09:14] <LindsayMac> dogarrhea2:  and you think that desktops are continuous in their support? I mean come on.. so you are also saying desktop web browsing is outdated because ... there are multiple browsers that support different things differenty
[16:09:18] <ktstowell> biodegabriel:  prop can be tricky is .is(':checked')
[16:09:19] <ktstowell> erm
[16:09:21] <biodegabriel> Basically, .prop("checked") is always false. I don't know why....
[16:09:22] <ktstowell> use*
[16:09:29] <biodegabriel> ktstowell: OK i'll try that. thanks!
[16:09:32] <LindsayMac> dogarrhea2:  you can't do EVERYTHING but for many web apps, you CAN do everything yuu need
[16:09:44] <ktstowell>  same true/false return
[16:09:46] <LindsayMac> codepython777:  thats why i said there are a load of resources online
[16:09:55] <LindsayMac> mozilla website has a BUNCH of stuff...
[16:10:00] <dogarrhea2> we don't actually have a working jquery for mobile. Yes. I went there. jquery mobile is just widgets. it does not solve the underlying "scrollTop does not work" bugs "sound doesn't play more than once" bugs and other things
[16:10:01] <zorph> mischief, r u sure the likeData.tag has a value? and that an attribute exists with that value?
[16:10:04] <dogarrhea2> it's a widget library. nothing more
[16:10:23] <codepython777> so  no one reads books these days? :)
[16:10:27] <LindsayMac> and that makes web apps useless.. again, your logic is a mess..
[16:10:30] <ktstowell> and also, biodegabriel, prop works like this: .prop("checked", true), etc
[16:10:34] <mischief> zorph: yes
[16:10:35] <mischief> its working
[16:10:37] <ktstowell> codepython777:  sec
[16:10:38] <LindsayMac> codepython777:  no but the time they come out (in regards to coding) things have changed...
[16:10:45] <LindsayMac> in some cases.
[16:10:56] <zorph> mischief, it's working now?
[16:11:10] <mischief> yes
[16:11:11] <LindsayMac> So i stick with web related content.. even if paid for, i'm happy with real time releases for current trends
[16:11:11] <codepython777> LindsayMac: Learning jQuery 3rd edition is not even a year old
[16:11:17] <codepython777> ktstowell: thanks, waiting.
[16:11:21] <zorph> mischief, so the problem was?
[16:11:42] <mischief> my syntax and string quoting was incorrect
[16:12:02] <LindsayMac> codepython777:  I dont know the roadmap, but when's the next one coming out?
[16:12:18] <codepython777> no idea, the last one just came out
[16:12:18] <LindsayMac> its ALWAYS in development
[16:12:24] <codepython777> I know
[16:12:27] <ktstowell> Anyone who hasn't read this book needs to: http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752
[16:12:27] <LindsayMac> codepython777:  code lots and release often..
[16:12:29] <codepython777> But I dont even have the basics
[16:12:42] <ktstowell> start architecting your js folks
[16:13:19] <dogarrhea2> LindsayMac: we are in a clusterfuck of mobile web dev that parallels the greate netscape vs microsoft battle years ago.  just admit only that. just that.
[16:13:24] <LindsayMac> I am just saying that books are ok, but but you can learn a LOT from the web. Books aren't useless, but you're best off learning about the concepts of the languages from books and learn about things like jquery 3.X via the net
[16:14:06] <LindsayMac> and what does that have to do with being useless to code for? Mobile browsing is NEW.
[16:14:21] <LindsayMac> there's kinks to work out, but there are also some AWESOME things that can be done with mobile browsing
[16:14:50] <zorph> what's a 'book' ? lol
[16:15:07] <LindsayMac> my intern picked up an old record and was like "What's this" ?
[16:15:42] <zorph> wow
[16:16:10] <LindsayMac> I wish i was kiddin
[16:16:11] <LindsayMac> g
[16:17:20] <LindsayMac> trying to decide the best way to simply toggle a menu on tap
[16:17:54] <zorph> the toggle() function is nice
[16:18:10] <codepython777> book recommendations please?
[16:18:27] <LindsayMac> zorph:  i must be doing something wrong OR somethings conflicting..
[16:18:45] <zorph> paste
[16:18:57] <LindsayMac> https://gist.github.com/476945efa6be92874079
[16:19:22] <LindsayMac> zorph:  and then I have only a simple <ul?
[16:20:07] <LindsayMac> https://gist.github.com/6fe505a92c54cdf0d353
[16:20:44] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:21:22] <zorph> LindsayMac, U wanna toggle the whole menu? Or accomplish hover dropdowns?
[16:21:34] <zorph> paste js along with the html
[16:21:35] <LindsayMac> oops.. i am making a fiddle.. that paste was a sad excuse
[16:21:47] <LindsayMac> zorph:  this is for iphone verion of site.. so tap/click
[16:23:54] <LindsayMac> zorph:  this isn't much better but did it on the quick http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/rKsgN/
[16:23:57] <tash1> man I'm having a brain cramp...I have several rows in a table and in one of the <td>'s in each row is a checkbox with an id of 'jobid[12]' or 'jobid[98]' for example.  When someon checks an empty checkbox I want to do something, and vice versa if its checked and they uncheck it.  I can't remember what type of event to use.
[16:24:03] <tash1> .click() ?
[16:24:20] <LindsayMac> zorph:  it works in there, which is the EXACT code from my site, which means I think i have a conflict
[16:25:46] <frewsxcv> Is there an easy way to turn a jQuery object into an array? e.g. $("myElement").children().toArray()[3]
[16:25:50] <LindsayMac> zorph:  i can give you access to my dev site if you can give me your IP
[16:26:24] <frewsxcv> rather than doing, myArray = []; $myElement.each(function () { myArray.push(this) });
[16:26:56] <frewsxcv> makeArray()?
[16:27:25] <systemfault> map...
[16:27:58] <systemfault> (If you don't need filtering..)
[16:28:53] <zorph> LindsayMac, Are you setting up the click callback in a $(document).ready callback?
[16:29:11] <LindsayMac> zorph:  yes...
[16:29:33] <LindsayMac> i am happy to share my site with you.. I actually think its another script conflicting because I was having issues with that more than anything.
[16:29:42] <LindsayMac> my ADD got me sidetracked to this menu thin g
[16:33:20] <frewsxcv> So there is a method called makeArray() http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
[16:33:33] <tash1> http://pastebin.com/9ZY5zzMA the last <td> in that row ... when I click the box I want to console.log the  rel value of the row ... can someone help me with that?
[16:33:41] <frewsxcv> But when I do $("myElement").children().makeArray(), it says makeArray is not a function
[16:34:22] <frewsxcv> Nevermind
[16:35:54] <zorph> Lindrian, check priv msg
[16:36:18] <zorph> Lindrian, sry wrong user
[16:36:49] <tash1> for anyone that saw my pastebin, is this close? alert ( $(this).parent().attr('rel') );
[16:36:58] <LindsayMac> zorph:  got it sorry
[16:37:03] <tash1> hmm, that didn't work ... says undefined
[16:37:35] <LindsayMac> tash1:  can you put your code into jsfiddle.net ?
[16:37:48] <tash1> LinsayMac: just figured it out
[16:37:52] <frewsxcv> Rather, here's my real question: I have an XML tree. I want to get an array of all teh children elements
[16:37:57] <tash1> used you guys as a rubber duck
[16:37:59] <tash1> :)
[16:40:17] <LindsayMac> tash1:  happens to me ALL THE TIME
[16:44:12] <LindsayMac> I have something weird happening on my mobile version of my page. When I go to the  page and view it and checkout the firebug console, I see this GET: thedomainname.com and it just spins and spins.. I dont know what its doing!
[16:45:04] <codepython777> http://jquery.com/ -- this has links to 5 books. Is jquery in action too old to read? Or should i go with Learning jQuery Third Edition?
[16:46:06] <kevinquinnyo> anyone have an idea why this as a greasemonkey script does not work, but does if i just paste it into firebug?  GM_log() does not log inside the function, but logs elsewhere just fine
[16:46:12] <kevinquinnyo> http://pastebin.ca/2175988  ^^
[16:46:49] <kevinquinnyo> wish i could provide the link to debug, but it's secure with sensitive data, i'm hoping someone knows of a "gotcha" or the like, with greasemonkey
[16:46:52] <coldhead> the old books are still relevant, codepython777, you just need to go the extra mile to read up on new things like deferreds and delegation, afterwards
[16:47:08] <rmurphey> and never, ever, ever use .live()
[16:47:25] <coldhead> the core jQuery ideals of CSS selectors and chaining are Timeless and Eternal
[16:48:17] <dogarrhea2> does anyone have a workaround for the onended event not firing for html5 on android?
[16:48:35] <dogarrhea2> basically the problem is the event never firing after an mp3 or other file completes playing
[16:48:47] <dogarrhea2> fires*
[16:50:06] <tash1> I've got some code on my page that will perform a certain function if you checkb a checkbox that isn't previously checked: $( ".schedule-item :checkbox[checked!=checked]" ).on( "click", function( e ) { // do stuff }
[16:50:53] <tash1> what if I add additional checkboxes to my page that aren't checked by default? I don't want to execute the same code ... so can I tell that previous .on() to only do that for checked!=checked and rel=blahblah ?
[16:50:56] <tash1> or something like that
[16:52:38] <kamo> @tash1 The .on() should be setup a acting like a $.live() so that when more become unchecked the page will attach the event
[16:53:46] <dogarrhea2> ARGH. http://gizmodo.com/5913066/developer-explains-why-android-sucks-for-some-audio-apps  <---- this is why it's useless to me LindsayMac
[16:54:19] <LindsayMac> So that makes web development USELESS WORLD WIDE
[16:54:40] <dogarrhea2> web dev on android does suck for sure
[16:55:01] <coldhead> would you say that android is the new ie6?
[16:55:20] <dogarrhea2> yes
[16:56:03] <kamo> @tash1 please look under this heading, "Changing from .live() to .on()", to see what I mean on this site: http://www.andismith.com/blog/2011/11/on-and-off/
[16:56:07] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  and that makes developing for mobile web useless.. supposedly
[16:57:36] <coldhead> i'm very new to jQuery, lucky i don't have to worry about mobile yet
[16:57:47] <dogarrhea2> when there are dozens of devices out there. some with support for smoething. some without, and the older versions not supporting html5 audio at all, that does suck for web development on mobile platforms
[16:59:37] <coldhead> audio in web pages is ambitious
[17:00:31] <dogarrhea2> 1 billion dollars for youtube.. hulu at greater value. both use sound. i wonder
[17:00:51] <shoky> :\
[17:01:30] <dogarrhea2> but they are a very specific use case. click button. play video. click pause. pause video. the end
[17:01:45] <dogarrhea2> i wonder if what i'm doing is impossible for mobile dev
[17:02:00] <LindsayMac> what ARE you doing?
[17:02:03] <shoky> go native go
[17:02:22] <ColKurtz> I wish I had an android
[17:02:26] <LindsayMac> basically you go native when you can because.. well.. people prefer native
[17:02:28] <ColKurtz> so I can prove dogarrhea2 wrong/help him
[17:02:34] <ColKurtz> :P
[17:02:49] <xcv> hat are you doing?
[17:02:51] <xcv> what*
[17:02:51] <dogarrhea2> LindsayMac: thank god you're not in marketing.
[17:03:01] <LindsayMac> dogarrhea2:  erm... what?
[17:03:10] <dogarrhea2> people don't prefer native to browse the web :/
[17:03:15] <dogarrhea2> imagine 1 app per domain
[17:03:23] <LindsayMac> People prefer native for APPLICATION STYLE INTERFACES
[17:03:24] <LindsayMac> christ
[17:03:34] <dogarrhea2> define "application style interface"
[17:03:43] <shoky> non web
[17:03:52] <ColKurtz> what exactly is the app?
[17:04:20] <ColKurtz> idk about you dogarrhea2 but the only thing I use my mobile browser for is a) occasional need to find out some information, or b) find out how to get somewhere/what their address is/what their phone # is
[17:04:27] <ColKurtz> anything like listening to music I use native apps for
[17:04:46] <ColKurtz> I think that represents fairly normal use
[17:04:47] <LindsayMac> if you are trying to create an application on the web that benefits from native interfaces/ interactions and is used on a regular basis.. people prefer native.. if you are making a website mobile friendly and it's an application-like site (like an auto insurance rate system or booking an appointment) then mobile web is fine
[17:04:53] <dogarrhea2> my app is the "find information" type of app
[17:04:59] <ColKurtz> what information
[17:05:10] <LindsayMac> dogarrhea2:  but i thought you said you wanted to play audio...
[17:05:18] <dogarrhea2> that's part of finding things
[17:05:26] <ColKurtz> something involving music doesn't sound like "shit, what's the director fo that movie again??'
[17:05:46] <ColKurtz> finding stuff aided by an audio interface should be a native & desktop app
[17:05:59] <dogarrhea2> yes i know about soundhound and shazam.
[17:06:01] <ColKurtz> well a desktop web app possibly  i mean
[17:06:06] <dogarrhea2> and all those tagging services
[17:06:17] <LindsayMac> dogarrhea2:  so yea.. you developing that as a mobile web app is going to likely flip
[17:06:21] <LindsayMac> and flop
[17:06:41] <xcv> are you going to use the platform's native methods?
[17:06:44] <LindsayMac> interfaces that people use regularly (and i'm assuming you want people to use your interface regularly and in a snap when needed) are native apps.
[17:06:48] <xcv> tyo do the search
[17:06:50] <dogarrhea2> just playing sound
[17:06:57] <dogarrhea2> no dildo vibration
[17:07:58] <kevinquinnyo> nm my question above, solved, as usual, shortly after i give up and ask #jquery ...
[17:08:20] <coldhead> that's what #jQuery is here for, good work kev
[17:08:27] <coldhead> confessional debugging at its best
[17:08:28] <dogarrhea2> really, the main functionality that sounds so simple is this: sequence of mp3 (or other sound format) are being played one after another (they may be short in length, less than 1 second in length)
[17:08:41] <shoky> jquery is for quitters
[17:09:26] <LindsayMac> playing music sound is generally done via a native interface. its how people use their phones..
[17:09:55] <dogarrhea2> here are the problems i run into: plays first mp3 once and does nothing. plays first mp3 in sequence way after the user has said "screw this i'm going home", onended event not firing to play second mp3 in sequence.
[17:10:21] <dogarrhea2> yea i guess it's just native app then
[17:10:22] <LindsayMac> In fact.. everything except looking up wikipedia , directions, addresses, or  a quick article is done via native apps...
[17:11:08] <dogarrhea2> and so you admit.
[17:11:22] <LindsayMac> admit what?? That web apps are useless and no one should code for them?
[17:11:24] <LindsayMac> no way..
[17:11:30] <shoky> that you're not in sales
[17:11:44] <dogarrhea2> and I quote: " In fact.. everything except looking up wikipedia , directions, addresses, or  a quick article is done via native apps"
[17:11:50] <dogarrhea2> seems restrictive.
[17:11:57] <LindsayMac> because there are instances.. like I said where a web application is perfect such as insurance polict stuff, appointment making, etc/
[17:11:59] <dogarrhea2> directions/address is done using the navigation app anyways
[17:12:16] <LindsayMac> dogarrhea2:  not as often as you would think on the directions/addresses...
[17:12:31] <LindsayMac> and I left out the applications because that is a one-off thing for the most part..
[17:12:37] <LindsayMac> I was talking about every day usage
[17:21:54] <dogarrhea2> so ends the monday
[17:23:16] <dogarrhea2> gotta pack up and move my shit
[17:31:41] <fontzter> hi. anyone know if/when there will be a 2012 Boston conference?
[17:42:33] <rmurphey> fontzter: i know there was talk of one but not sure what became of it
[17:50:21] <LindsayMac> does jquery mobile support swipe to next page?
[17:53:10] <LindsayMac> For some reason, I have my containers all set up on one page, and clicking on my elements will bring me to my next panel, but the HOME page isn showing up first
[17:56:25] <frewsxcv> I'm a bit confused. When I do console.log(myJqueryElement), on firefox it shows up as a jquery object, but on chrome it's actually showing me an array of HTML (the contents)
[17:58:27] <haizum> how can i execute some js after an onclick event which opens a new page?
[17:58:44] <haizum> like a link basically
[17:58:56] <haizum> but i need it to run some js on onload
[17:59:04] <coldhead> you want the code to execute in the new page?
[18:02:12] <shoky> frewsxcv: that's just the different browsers displaying different aspects of the object
[18:02:37] <frewsxcv> shoky: how does chrome know to display an array-like object as an array?
[18:02:48] <shoky> frewsxcv: because it is array-like ;P
[18:03:13] <frewsxcv> shoky: if i do $myElement.children(), that returns an array-like object, right?
[18:03:18] <shoky> yeah
[18:03:44] <frewsxcv> so how do you test whether something is truly an array vs. an arraylike ojbect?
[18:04:02] <shoky> mmm
[18:04:07] <shoky> typeof i guess
[18:04:14] <frewsxcv> typeof array === "object"
[18:04:24] <frewsxcv> typeof [] === "object"
[18:04:28] <frewsxcv> rather
[18:04:42] <LindsayMac> I am having a heck of a time with jquery mobile. if anyone has a moment to take a look, i'd be happy to give you access... but need an IP .
[18:04:44] <shoky> yah mm
[18:04:52] <frewsxcv> mm?
[18:04:54] <LindsayMac> I cant seem to figure out why my #home will not load as the home
[18:08:14] <frewsxcv> are all jQuery objects array like?
[18:08:56] <ngharo> si
[18:08:59] <shoky> frewsxcv: yeah
[18:09:08] <shoky> frewsxcv: you can use $.type
[18:09:20] <shoky> (which uses Object.prototype.toString)
[18:09:51] <codepython7771> I want to create a hover effect in which if a table element has the mouse for more than 3 seconds, i pop out a new html page centered on the current page and show more details about the table item. What plugin/library should i look at?
[18:10:03] <shoky> e.g. Object.prototype.toString([1,2]) == '[object Array]'
[18:10:06] <shoky> oops
[18:10:11] <shoky> e.g. Object.prototype.toString.call([1,2]) == '[object Array]'
[18:18:13] <LindsayMac> So i am using <input id="testBt" type="button" data-inline="true" value="Menu"> to try to toggle my menu for jquery Mobile site. I have the code in my header for the button, and it's there, but it just isn't toggling!
[18:18:31] <LindsayMac> sadly, the jsfiddle works.. so i would have to show you my live example
[18:20:12] <LindsayMac> it seems there's  not a lot of good base website examples for jq mobile
[18:23:04] <BoarderX> I'm also developing a small jqm app and it's been a bit painful
[18:23:16] <LindsayMac> BoarderX:  ok so its not me!!!
[18:23:17] <LindsayMac> lol
[18:23:31] <LindsayMac> maybe you can help though.. i'm on the absolutely BEGINING stages and i'm already stuck!
[18:23:41] <BoarderX> I might
[18:23:44] <BoarderX> I make no guarantees
[18:24:03] <LindsayMac> lol.. all i ask is for a quick look!
[18:24:16] <LindsayMac> can i have your iP? I need to give you access to our dev environment
[18:40:44] <yen_> <script> jQuery('.page-links').appendTo('.ogp_single_text p:last').css ({"display":"inline", "margin-left":5px"}); </script>  -- does this look correct? trying to move "next page" at the end of the sentence on this page: http://goo.gl/CUlAF
[18:50:46] <binaryfus10nz> does anyone have any clue why this ajax has been built to have conditionals for IE http://collabedit.com/s6hmr
[19:18:47] <deeprogram> hi ? do you know any plugin make page transition like jquery.mobile ?
[19:18:58] <deeprogram> I only need page transition
[19:19:02] <deeprogram> feature
[19:19:47] <LindsayMac> deeprogram:  swipe.js
[19:19:58] <LindsayMac> i am wrestling with it now.. but its the only one I could get to work
[19:20:04] <deeprogram> LindsayMac: thanks a lot!
[19:20:47] <LindsayMac> deeprogram:  GOOD LUCK! You will need it
[19:21:58] <deeprogram> :D
[19:25:36] <deeprogram> I am building single page app with backbone + requirejs
[19:27:24] <libryder> sounds like fun
[19:27:58] <libryder> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0
[19:28:04] <libryder> everyone needs this in their life right now
[19:28:16] <LindsayMac> deeprogram:  good luck!
[19:28:20] <LindsayMac> you need it
[19:35:18] <coldhead> this is certainly something, libryder
[19:35:41] <hobs_> its catchy even if I dont know a godamn word he is saying
[19:35:49] <hobs_> its just pop music basically
[19:36:38] <coldhead> "The song is characterized by its strongly addictive beats and lyrics, and is thus certain to penetrate the foundations of modern philosophy."
[19:36:39] <hobs_> I was waiting for the ladies to come out
[19:37:01] <coldhead> i thought modern philosophy was predicated on the death of certainty
[19:37:12] <hobs_> fuck that
[19:37:13] <coldhead> so this is food for thought
[19:46:41] <amirite>  /join #perl
[19:47:26] * abletony84 is now playing: http://soundcloud.com/haukeland/jd004
[19:47:29] <abletony84> coldhead: u get that
[19:58:47] <frewsxcv> Does .toArray() return an array of jQuery object or an array of DOM elements
[19:59:26] <libryder> frewsxcv: an array of dom elements
[20:01:41] <frewsxcv> Someone should respond to http://api.jquery.com/toArray/#comment-82427088
[20:01:52] <frewsxcv> It's not very clear what it returns in the docs
[20:02:43] <shoky> huh
[20:02:45] <shoky> All of the matched DOM nodes are returned by this call, contained in a standard array
[20:04:55] <frewsxcv> Something that's kind of annoying, is that if I have multiple elements in jQuery object, and I to .toArray() on it, they both appear the same in Chrome's console
[20:05:12] <frewsxcv> And I have no idea which one is the jQuery object vs. primitive
[20:05:21] <coldhead> do you need to toArray() it?
[20:05:38] <coldhead> it's only my first day using jQuery but i haven't needed toArray yet
[20:05:40] <frewsxcv> Not really, but does that sound right? Should they print the same?
[20:05:46] <shoky> yes
[20:05:53] <shoky> that's just how chrome shows it
[20:06:19] <shoky> +1 on not ever needing to use toArray
[20:06:22] <tw2113> sup :D
[20:06:30] <shoky> ;dZ:DzD:ZD hey boy
[20:06:45] <coldhead> typeof will probably tell you a differen story
[20:06:50] <coldhead> chrome is just trying to be helpful
[20:16:02] <libryder> toArray turns an array of jquery objects, and returns an array of their DOM equivalents
[20:16:25] <libryder> <array of jquery ojbects>.toArray() -> <array of DOM elements>
[20:27:35] <dmishe> Hey, has anybody had an issue with jScrollPane, when resizing window vertically, the native scrollbar shows up for a second
[20:27:45] <dmishe> it is kinda flickers under JS scrollbar
[20:51:09] <tash1> can I set disabled="disabled" somehow with .attr()?
[20:51:19] <tash1> I want to set disabled on a checkbox ...
[20:51:59] <libryder> $('selector').prop('disabled', 'disabled')
[20:52:17] <libryder> tash1: check out prop and removeProp
[20:55:17] <tash1> libryder: will do
[20:55:21] <tash1> I'm going to test that now btw
[20:55:46] <devslash> i use a query file tree and the object is named $('#myMusicStreamer_fileTree').fileTree how do i get the value of root which points to the root folder
[20:59:09] <tash1> libryder: so, should you have to reload the page? Or, will it do it live?
[20:59:12] <tash1> I want the latter
[20:59:26] <tash1> maybe I want .live somewhere in there?
[20:59:33] <libryder> tash1: you have to reload to see the new code
[20:59:49] <rodd> Hi, I'm loading html content from ajax, once I retrieve it I select a specific element that will be appended to the page, the rest wont be used. Something like var contentToBeUsed = $( contentFromAjax ).find('.element');
[21:00:10] <rodd> I'd like to get rid of what is left of contentFromAjax
[21:00:39] <libryder> rodd: you have to understand, that is far too broad of a question to be answered intelligibly
[21:01:25] <devslash> can anyone help me out ?
[21:01:38] <rodd> Well, what I mean is, what will not be used will become "zombies"
[21:01:40] <devslash> i use a jquery file tree and the object is named $('#myMusicStreamer_fileTree') how do i get the value of root which points to the root folder
[21:01:43] <rodd> Idk if GC would get rid of it
[21:03:16] <kerrick> $('#someElement').keypress(someObject.someMethod)
[21:04:07] <kerrick> When a key is pressed, this will cause someObject.someMethod to be called, with "this" set to $('#someElement'), instead of someObject
[21:04:39] <kerrick> This is not the behavior I want; I need "this" to refer to someObject. Is there any way to override jQuery's behavior?
[21:08:02] <rodd> kerrick maybe this http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.proxy ?
[21:17:06] <kerrick> rodd, that did what I needed. Thanks!
[21:17:37] <rodd> welcome
[21:17:50] <devslash> i use a jquery file tree and the object is named $('#myMusicStreamer_fileTree') how do i get the value of root which points to the root folder
[21:21:31] <devslash> is anyone here
[21:22:03] <digipol> sure
[21:23:01] <devslash> i use a jquery file tree and the object is named $('#myMusicStreamer_fileTree') how do i get the value of root which points to the root folder
[21:24:49] <devslash> do you know how to do that
[21:26:19] <devslash> anyone ?
[21:31:24] <heshanh> how do a pass a function name as an argument, i a common function that does a ajax call to insert data to the db. i want to pass in diff function names so i can call them when the ajax function complete4s
[21:41:29] <devslash> is anyone here
[21:42:27] <devslash> hey timing
[21:42:30] <devslash> timoxley:
[21:47:43] <heshanh> no ones here
[21:47:44] <heshanh> lol
[21:51:41] <coldhead> heshanh: http://jsfiddle.net/4jcvR/
[21:56:40] <heshanh> thanks cold, didnt think i'd be that easy lol
[21:57:05] <coldhead> that's probably the only nice thing about JS, heshanh, first class functions
[21:59:06] <heshanh> the other question i have is, when i do $.post. do i need to set a "success" function or would just function(data) works? this is what i have at the moment, i cant get the alert to trigger http://jsfiddle.net/GpeUW/
[21:59:25] <heshanh> i can see the response data in firebug
[22:00:08] <coldhead> jQuery.post( url [, data] [, success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)]
[22:00:14] <coldhead> so you have the right params in the right order
[22:00:15] <heshanh> ignore all the fn[window] stuff i was just teting something
[22:00:56] <coldhead> my guess is that jQuery doesn't feel the request is successful
[22:01:08] <coldhead> if you are asking for JSON and the data you get back is not valid json
[22:01:13] <coldhead> jquery doesn't consider that "success"
[22:01:33] <heshanh> crap, you're right
[22:01:39] <heshanh> im just echoing a string
[22:01:44] <coldhead> that'll do it :)
[22:02:00] <heshanh> worked! thankx again :)
[22:03:27] <coldhead> YOU ARE WELCOME
[22:03:43] <devslash> hey guys I'm debugging my site using firebug. here is the pastebin http://pastebin.com/ET1wgXxL when i issue the command in line 1 i get the output in line 3 of the paste bin. how can i isolate that to only get the value of rel ?
[22:07:20] <devslash> can anyone help me out  ?
[22:08:12] <heshanh> leme see
[22:08:14] <coldhead> $('#myMusicStreamer_fileTree').find('li a:first').attr('rel')
[22:09:43] <devslash> ok thanks
[22:10:19] <devslash> thats exactly what I'm looking for
[22:10:35] <heshanh> probably best not to mix jquery and normal js syntax :S i always find it hard to debug
[22:16:29] <devslash> heshanh: that line is pure query syntax isn't it
[22:17:48] <heshanh> i thought getelementbytag was part of old school js
[22:17:52] <heshanh> could be wrong
[22:18:39] <heshanh> colds answer is pure qj
[22:18:41] <heshanh> jq*
[22:18:52] <devslash> yea thats what i meant
[22:18:58] <heshanh> oh
[22:19:01] <heshanh> yeah
[22:19:15] <heshanh> i meant the original line of code you had
[22:28:17] <LoneStar99> good evening lads
[22:29:31] <LoneStar99> what do you all recommend for a small process bar? have ajax request that sometimes takes a few seconds?
[22:29:48] <LoneStar99> an animated gif?
[22:29:54] <digipol> twitter bootstrap has a nice progress bar
[22:30:02] <coldhead> i think a spinner is a better solution than a bar
[22:30:11] <coldhead> because the spinner says "something is happening"
[22:30:25] <coldhead> a progress bar makes a false promise of how long something will take
[22:31:13] <coldhead> the user will go "oh it's 50% done" and it's not at all
[22:34:22] <LoneStar99> ok a spinner sounds good
[22:34:37] <LoneStar99> so i make an animated gif?
[22:35:02] <heshanh> google images?
[22:35:44] <LoneStar99> http://www.cssload.net/
[22:35:47] <LoneStar99> seems cool
[22:36:12] <heshanh> even better
[22:36:33] <heshanh> wait
[22:36:44] <heshanh> thats html5 isnt it
[22:37:19] <heshanh> i'd personally go with a tiny 1-2kb gif than that
[22:38:18] <LoneStar99> hmm... yeah tiny sounds good
[22:40:49] <LoneStar99> http://ajaxload.info/
[22:40:58] <LoneStar99> seems alot smaller...
[22:42:27] <heshanh> smaller the better :D
[22:46:49] <LoneStar99> yeap
[23:01:02] <Samian> Hello!
[23:01:26] <Samian> Can anyone look at my two resumes and please tell me which spacing looks nicer?
[23:03:06] <coldhead> i think you want #resume-critiques
[23:04:02] <Samian> nice try but that channel is empty
[23:06:03] <coldhead> :(
[23:06:29] <coldhead> carelessly aged fossils and shells waiting in wishing wells
[23:07:25] <digipol> um. why would you ask that in this channel?
[23:08:01] <heshanh> maybe he thought this is #inquiry
[23:08:07] <coldhead> hahahhahah
[23:08:29] <digipol> weird.
[23:08:30] <heshanh> lol
[23:08:56] <digipol> does anyone have a good recipe for cake?
[23:09:09] <digipol> could someone please spellcheck my essay?
[23:09:31] <heshanh> mmmm cake
[23:09:46] <heshanh> 1hr to go home. im gona pick up a big ass blackforest on the way
[23:10:46] <digipol> yes it is that time of day. counting down till home time.
[23:11:06] * Samian sings the blues
[23:44:42] <frewsxcv> So I have this in a constructor http://pastie.org/4363763
[23:44:58] <frewsxcv> But it says Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'push' of undefined
[23:45:20] <frewsxcv> oh, probably because each is overwriting 'this' ?
[23:45:26] <coldhead> exactly!
[23:45:28] <ktstowell> this inside of .find doesn't mean teh same thing
[23:45:31] <coldhead> good debugging, frewsxcv
[23:46:22] <frewsxcv> so what is a recommended route to get what i want. i could make a temporary array, and then set it to this.labels after?
[23:46:30] <ktstowell> most commonly
[23:46:43] <ktstowell> people will resolve teh scope with a dedicated var
[23:46:45] <ktstowell> such as
[23:46:46] <EnginA> autocomplete minLength option does not work here ?
[23:46:49] <ktstowell> var self = this;
[23:46:53] <ktstowell> then
[23:46:57] <ktstowell> inside your $.each
[23:47:09] <ktstowell> say self.labels.push
[23:47:31] <EnginA> anything besides jquery is buggy, what kind of world is this, should I write every piece of widget myself. i hate writing UI elements because it is A LOT of tedious work >:/
[23:48:08] <ktstowell> I write most UI components myself
[23:48:09] <EnginA> I've tried jqwidgets too, which proved to be buggy too.
[23:48:17] <frewsxcv> cool, thanks
[23:48:21] <ktstowell> not a huge fan of jqui
[23:48:36] <ktstowell> too rigid of mark up requirements for most things.
[23:48:46] <EnginA> ktstowell: are they keyboard controllable and give visual feedback on events as they really should ?
[23:48:56] <EnginA> just to satisfy these two conditions is tedious enough :)
[23:49:16] <rabbi1> how can i recall a jquery function or reload the entire jquery dynamically ?
[23:49:27] <ktstowell> visual yes, keyboard depends on the widget
[23:49:41] <coldhead> $.getScript('/path/to/jQuery')
[23:50:02] <ktstowell> my modal, for example, doesn't listen to keyboard events.
[23:51:41] <gabriel1> Guys, if I do a $(this).attr('customAttrib') and this do not contain that attribute, what do attr return?
[23:52:02] <ktstowell> []
[23:52:15] <ktstowell> is what will show in the console
[23:52:30] <gabriel1> empty array?
[23:52:42] <coldhead> gabriel1: undefined
[23:52:55] <gabriel1> hmm, can I compare that to null ?
[23:52:57] <ktstowell> so because that is technically is something, youll have to do .length to check for legit values
[23:53:02] <gabriel1> ah ok
[23:53:21] <coldhead> ?eval null == undefined
[23:53:23] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[23:53:27] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[23:53:27] * bot-t sighs
[23:53:28] <gabriel1> I can do if blah.length > 0 do something
[23:53:43] <ktstowell> yes
[23:53:56] <gabriel1> thanks alot for clarifying
[23:54:00] <gabriel1> cheers
