[02:01:51] <overburn> hey guys
[02:02:34] <overburn> quick question - say i do a $.post , and i store the object in a variable. the thing is when i try to access the response of the object, it's empty. when i console.log the object it's a xmlhttprequest with all the parameters there. any ideas?
[02:04:20] <Robbington> overburn: How are you trying to access it?
[02:05:51] <overburn>  rt.response , rt.responseText , rt['response'] , rt['responseText'] - none work
[02:06:44] <Robbington> Prob something to do with your syntax, Im no expert was just dealing with the same issue recently
[02:06:55] <nlogax> and you are waiting for the request to complete?
[02:07:04] <Robbington> Hey, bit of a noob question, but how can I collate two elements into a single bit of data to send via ajax? $ajaxData = new Array(el1, el2) returns
[02:07:18] <overburn> well, if i console.log(rt) the output is ok
[02:07:31] <overburn> isn't x = $.post(something) blocking?
[02:07:45] <nlogax> overburn, no :)
[02:07:46] <jrockjiggz> Robbington: $('#el1').extend( $('#el2') )
[02:08:17] <jrockjiggz> oh i read your question wrong
[02:08:34] <overburn> nlogax - oh, and how do i wait for it to complete?
[02:08:54] <nlogax> overburn, there is a callback parameter
[02:09:51] <overburn> yeah ,but i can't use anything i do in the callback in the rest of my function :(
[02:09:58] <overburn> as it is async
[02:10:02] <jrockjiggz> Robbington: $data = {'el1': $('#el').data(), 'el2': $('#el2').data() });
[02:10:02] <overburn> any way to make it synchronous?
[02:10:11] <nlogax> just move it around a bit
[02:10:27] <Robbington> jrockjiggz: Cheers
[02:31:12] <poppiez> how does jquery handle FormData objects passed to the ajax data prop?
[03:00:21] <_johnny> hi, i'm having trouble googling the problem, so sorry if this is a dumb question: can i, on a http basic auth protected html page (with jquery loaded) retreive the username? since the auth is sent on the http request header, i'm thinking no, but am i wrong? the reason i'm asking is that i want to pass along the auth to a 2nd server (running different port, which i know is highly insecure)
[03:01:04] <Alex`> Hi guys, in a draggable element i can get the x,y pos with (this.offset().left/top) but this give me the absolute position but I need the position relative of the parrent (dunno if I'm clear :( )
[03:10:23] <Gozzy82> Alex` http://api.jquery.com/position/
[03:12:20] <Alex`> Gozzy82: Why I don't get is when i use position it's dynamic I mean each time I move my draggable item, the x,y change with the pos it dosent, is that normal? should I do offset - position to get the position I want?
[03:12:26] <Alex`> What I ...*
[03:13:02] <Alex`> I mean when i use Offset it's dynamic not possition
[03:14:14] <Gozzy> it says that it should be relative to the parent but i have not ever used this function so i dont really know, what you can do as a simple fix is get offset().left/top and subtract your parent offset left/top from it
[03:15:30] <Alex`> Gozzy: I guess so ;) Thanks ;)
[03:15:35] <Gozzy> perhaps the parent is moving along with the element your getting the position from, you can try going up the .parent() path and check position from there
[03:16:00] <Alex`> Ok i'll try
[03:16:04] <Alex`> thanks !
[03:16:05] <antnash> Hey guys. I'm trying to get something to happen when a div is ready, so I've put  $('#filelist').ready(function() {.....}); but it doesn't seem to be doing anything. I've tried just putting an alert in there but still nada. What could be happening?
[03:16:09] <Gozzy> yw
[03:18:10] <antnash> it doesn't even alert if I do $(document).ready(....);

[03:18:21] <ticktock71> I asked: Why is it outputted in some manner for my Opera browser?
[03:19:44] <Gozzy> antnash $(document).ready(function(){alert('');}); should always work ifnot jquery is not loaded
[03:20:48] <antnash> Gozzy: It's definitely working, because I've got functions defined before that which work

[03:22:47] <Gozzy> antnash then it probally works when you put that statement above all other javascript statements and if that is the case you probally have a unclosed function or missing ;
[03:23:06] <antnash> Gozzy: without jquery loaded, I wouldn't be able to set var fname = $('#fname').value; would I?
[03:23:26] <Gozzy> jup without jquery loaded $ does not exist
[03:23:40] <Gozzy> erm by the way .value?
[03:23:47] <Gozzy> you mean .val();
[03:24:53] <antnash> I do now
[03:24:56] <Afflicto> http://pastebin.com/1zGvS3C5 <- simple click function on an anchor. Why is this not working? :S
[03:26:15] <antnash> Gozzy: Can I just check that this syntax is all correct please http://pastebin.com/943wwsnS
[03:27:16] <antnash> And I just noticed the missing ; on line 12. Added it, but no cigar

[04:12:18] <Gozzy> Kartagis what does not work, if you make a testcase on jsfiddler.net or webdevout.com/test its much easier to help you

[04:38:51] <Kartagis> http://www.webdevout.net/test?01R
[04:39:01] <Kartagis> can anybody help with this?
[04:39:24] <Kartagis> I'm having trouble to get it to work
[04:40:34] <osirisx11> Kartagis: missing your input in the html?
[04:41:02] <osirisx11> btw try out www.jsfiddle.net for these kinds of things
[04:41:09] <Kartagis> osirisx11: where am I missing? oh
[04:41:14] <Kartagis> one sec
[04:42:50] <Kartagis> osirisx11: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0x
[04:43:19] <Kartagis> osirisx11: on jsfiddle.net what should I select?
[04:44:28] <osirisx11> you'll figure it out pretty quickly Kartagis
[04:44:54] <osirisx11> yea this example you've pasted from webdevout is no good
[04:45:01] <osirisx11> it wants javascript ONLY in that ecamscript box i think
[04:45:14] <osirisx11> and you should have an <input> tag somewhere in the html section with the id you're looking for in the js
[04:45:31] <osirisx11> also: <script
[04:45:32] <osirisx11> jQuery(function($){
[04:45:36] <osirisx11> your script tag is not closed there
[04:46:33] <Kartagis> I have an input tag
[04:46:44] <Kartagis> oh, I get it now

[04:49:08] <Kartagis> osirisx11: ^^
[04:50:40] <osirisx11> Kartagis: again, where it says javascript, it wants js only.. not script tags.
[04:51:10] <osirisx11> also Kartagis, you're referencing a script file that is not hosted on jsfiddle, you need to reference it from the web somewhere
[04:51:15] <osirisx11> let me help you
[04:52:21] <osirisx11> this is closer Kartagis http://jsfiddle.net/JJf7n/
[04:52:31] <osirisx11> note jquery on the left is selected
[04:54:44] <Kartagis> hmm, I don't need the <script> tags around the query code?
[04:55:43] <osirisx11> Kartagis: not unless it is in html
[04:55:55] <osirisx11> <script> tags are html.. "javascript" section there acts like an external js reference
[04:56:06] <osirisx11> and in external js, it is not html
[05:00:07] <Kartagis> osirisx11: https://gist.github.com/2319187

[06:23:15] <hlveheart> I thought it might have been my charset, but changing that didn't help
[06:23:16] <rroelofs> just google for web safe fonts
[06:23:49] <hlveheart> sunbeam, you could also use google fonts and they are all web safe.

[06:28:38] <g0th> hi
[06:28:51] <g0th> is there a jquery sort function?
[06:29:00] <g0th> to sort childrens according to some criteria
[06:29:02] <Prashles> ?sort
[06:29:06] <bot-t> Prashles, #255 (Add reverse and sort to jQuery core) – jQuery Core - Bug ... - Opened 6 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/255
[06:29:15] <Prashles> wel that failed
[06:29:31] <g0th> I tried google and jquery docu quickly
[06:29:39] <g0th> probably missed it but I didn't find it at first glance
[06:30:58] <mytoz_> this might do: $($("...").toArray().sort(function() { ... }));
[06:31:12] <g0th> oh
[06:31:26] <g0th> why $() at the end?
[06:31:48] <g0th> I want to rearrange the html elements
[06:31:59] <g0th> while keeping the html container element
[06:32:03] <mytoz_> oh.
[06:32:13] <g0th> by rearrange I mean change the order
[06:32:17] <Trisox> http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[06:32:26] <Trisox> http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[06:32:28] <g0th> what about underscore?
[06:32:49] <Trisox> http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[06:32:52] <Trisox> grrr
[06:32:57] <Trisox> this http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[06:33:06] <g0th> ?
[06:33:08] <Trisox> indeed underscore
[06:33:13] <Trisox> documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[06:33:22] <Trisox> wy cant i post url
[06:33:30] <WebDragon> hey folks
[06:33:36] <Trisox> documentcloud.github.com/underscore
[06:33:37] <g0th> why do you keep repeating the same site 5 times
[06:33:40] <Trisox> documentcloud.github.com underscore
[06:33:50] <Trisox> ?github underscore
[06:33:55] <Trisox> mm
[06:34:06] <g0th> oh, I see, you're just trolling
[06:34:15] <WebDragon> I got this custom slider I built for a client using wordpress custom post types to build them with rather than using normal posts, but I'm having an issue with the pick-it nav where if you click them in rapid succession suddenly they start to overlay each other. I have a .stop(true,true) in there, but I'm apparently DoingItWrong on the slide animation stuff
[06:34:29] <Trisox> http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[06:34:29] <g0th> mytoz_: your command will produce a new html element, no?
[06:34:30] <WebDragon> anyone got a moment to take a looksee ?
[06:35:09] <joeseph> Can I force the append method to not close a <div> tag that I open?  I am running through a loop and close it on the next iteration of the loop.
[06:35:25] <mytoz_> g0th: no, it will just turn the collection of elements to an array, sort the array, and then create a jquery object on that array
[06:35:28] <mytoz_> g0th: http://jsfiddle.net/gUx2T/
[06:36:35] <WebDragon> http://360.client-proof.com/wp-content/themes/360marketing/js/slidebar.js this is the script and http://360.client-proof.com/ this is the page the slider runs on
[06:37:17] <WebDragon> joeseph: stuff an array with the start and end div with the loop in between and THEN append the finished bit
[06:37:19] <g0th> you didn't use to array?
[06:37:59] <g0th> so .sort already works?
[06:38:30] <mytoz_> g0th: yeah, seems so
[06:38:31] <g0th> I have the parent html element and i do modifications to it all the time by doing $(el)....
[06:38:57] <g0th> if I do $(el).sort, $(el) will still work, right?
[06:39:14] <g0th> where is the documentation of jquery's .sort?
[06:39:31] <mytoz_> there doesn't seem to be any
[06:39:41] <g0th> but it is there, hmm
[06:39:43] <mytoz_> I guess jQuery basically uses Array.prototype
[06:39:48] <g0th> ah
[06:39:55] <g0th> and sort will affect only the childrens?
[06:40:04] <mytoz_> so $("...") returns an extended array
[06:40:06] <g0th> not grandchildrens
[06:40:14] <mytoz_> g0th: no, it will affect all the items in the array
[06:40:34] <g0th> hmm
[06:40:44] <g0th> if I want to sort the childrens of a container
[06:40:44] <mytoz_> g0th: when you do $("li") for example, that function returns an array with a bunch of other functions attached to it
[06:40:47] <g0th> what would I do then?
[06:41:34] <mytoz_> g0th: maybe you should read a bit more on how jQuery works beneath the hood
[06:41:38] <g0th> $(cont).find(child selector) ...
[06:42:04] <g0th> no
[06:42:04] <g0th> arg
[06:42:23] <g0th> I just have access to the parent, but from that it should be easy to get access to the childrens
[06:42:34] <g0th> in any case, lets say I have them
[06:42:47] <g0th> and I sort them, that doesn't make much sense to me
[06:43:06] <g0th> will they really be rearrange inside their parent?
[06:43:10] <g0th> what if they have multiple parents
[06:43:13] <g0th> it makes no sense
[06:43:40] <g0th> rearranged*
[06:44:01] <g0th> what I am saying is that sort should be for the "parent"
[06:44:25] <hlveheart> HTML is a very pervy pedo language you know.
[06:44:28] <hlveheart> <g0th> I just have access to the parent, but from that it should be easy to get access to the childrens
[06:44:31] <g0th> if not, resp. if it is based on a "selection", then I don't get how it works
[06:44:31] <hlveheart> o.o
[06:44:52] <g0th> lol ^^
[06:45:14] <g0th> you just made me laugh :)
[06:45:33] <hlveheart> lol :)
[06:45:41] <WebDragon> damn you guys scroll a lot. my question's already off the page
[06:46:02] <sunbeam> hlveheart: hlveheart duncanbeevers thanks
[06:46:09] <hlveheart> =]
[06:47:06] <fang0654> Anyone have any luck using jquery with mod_python, .ajax, and ie8?
[06:48:55] <g0th> what is a jquery element, when viewed as an array?
[06:49:30] <starsinmypockets> Hey mind looking here http://jsfiddle.net/yeJ7g/ ? I want the $mydom object to append every time the button is clicked, but it only works once... I think I
[06:49:37] <g0th> e.g. if I change the ordering of the array, what does that correspond to?
[06:49:41] <starsinmypockets> ... I'm using .clone() incorrectly
[06:51:07] <g0th> starsinmypockets: it is always appending the same thing
[06:51:40] <g0th> the "clones" are just called once
[06:51:58] <starsinmypockets> g0th --  Not sure I understand... I want to append a copy of the selected dom each time the button is pressed
[06:52:11] <g0th> basically put all the code from top inside your function
[06:53:06] <g0th> you want that the cloning happens when you click, right?
[06:53:07] <actwitty__> thanks jquery for bringing me up!! I am now live for private beta invites @ www.actwitty.com - the complete you.
[06:53:11] <g0th> but that's not what's happening
[06:53:23] <g0th> it is only happening once, in the first line
[06:54:19] <g0th> you could make $mydom a function for example
[06:54:42] <g0th> function mydom() = { return $('.foo').clone().add('.bar').clone().add('.baz').clone(); }
[06:55:03] <g0th> starsinmypockets: ping
[06:55:19] <g0th> so can anyone explain to me what jquery's sort does?
[06:56:46] <antnash> Hey guys. I'm having a problem with unchecking all checkboxes. This checks them, but doesn't uncheck them http://jsfiddle.net/3AkEE/1/
[06:58:08] <antnash> got it
[07:00:55] <prodserver> hi
[07:01:06] <prodserver> i am loading a tab control withiin a jquery ui dialog
[07:01:22] <prodserver> but when i open it the second time it loads the tab twice
[07:01:25] <prodserver> and messes up
[07:01:43] <prodserver> how do i use jquery to detect that the tab control is already loaded and not load it again
[07:03:11] <prodserver> hi hi
[07:04:01] <rroelofs> prodserver: could you add the tabs during the create event rather than during open?
[07:04:39] <rroelofs> prodserver: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-create
[07:05:18] <prodserver> ok
[07:05:42] <prodserver> wait what
[07:05:55] <prodserver> that link just takes me to the dialog page?
[07:05:58] <prodserver> whats the create event?
[07:06:33] <prodserver> well the thing is
[07:06:40] <prodserver> the dialog opens up and it loads another page
[07:06:47] <prodserver> and that other page has the tabs in it
[07:07:03] <prodserver> so i dont load the tabs within the dialog really
[07:07:42] <WebDragon> anyone here familiar with the ins and outs of stop() WRT jquery.ui.effects.(slide|fade) and can help me figure out why rapid-clicking on the pick-it nav for the slider at http://360.client-proof.com/ is currently causing some slides to overlay each other instead of staying in succession ? I *thought* I had dealt with that properly but apparently not
[07:07:46] <prodserver> but something wierd the second time i open the dialog i think the tab js is already in the dom
[07:07:58] <prodserver> cause i dont have an iframe in the dialog?
[07:08:01] <prodserver> is that right?
[07:08:06] <WebDragon> I've been poking at it for a while now but can't see where I went wrong with it
[07:08:27] <prodserver> rroelofs: help me man
[07:08:30] <WebDragon> prodserver: try not to use <ENTER> as a comma if at all possible. makes too much scroll
[07:08:37] * hlveheart slaps WebDragon around a bit with a large trout
[07:08:39] <Birliban> hi, with $("tr td").eq(1) i get just one result back, but i want all (second colums) in every tr. howto?
[07:08:48] * WebDragon slaps hlveheart  around a bit with a large NO FISHING ordinance and a hefty fine.
[07:08:49] <prodserver> webdragon: help me out
[07:08:52] <hlveheart> o.o
[07:08:57] <WebDragon> xD
[07:09:03] <WebDragon> I come prepared for trout season
[07:09:06] <hlveheart> prodserver, I hope nobody helps you for being so god damn rudwe
[07:09:08] <hlveheart> Rude*
[07:09:21] <ajpiano> Birliban: $("td:nth-child(2)")
[07:09:32] <hlveheart> that's not how you ask for help man
[07:09:33] * WebDragon slides the carafe of DragonCoffeeâ„¢ over to ajpiano 
[07:09:50] <WebDragon> mornin', mate
[07:09:59] <ajpiano> mornin
[07:10:12] <Birliban> ajpiano, thanks for that! ;-)
[07:11:52] <prodserver> wait
[07:12:02] <prodserver> so i load the page into the dialog with load
[07:12:22] <prodserver> can i load the js once using the create event?
[07:12:47] <hlveheart> Pssst. nobody help him until he apologizes for being so rude on a Friday.
[07:13:06] <WebDragon> hey, it's good friday. be forgiving
[07:13:26] <rroelofs> prodserver: probably, but I can only guess without code to look at
[07:13:53] <hlveheart> ?jsfiddle prodserver
[07:13:57] <hlveheart> i don't know the command
[07:13:58] <hlveheart> <_<
[07:14:13] <rroelofs> ?jsfiddle @ prodserver
[07:14:21] <rroelofs> ??
[07:14:31] <hlveheart> Bot on vacation or something
[07:14:32] <hlveheart> o,O?
[07:15:17] <Birliban> and is there any jquery built in function to make operations fpr a set of selected elements. e.g. $("td:nth-child(2)").text().sum() -> to get the sum if the text in td are numbers? ;-)
[07:15:35] <ajpiano> ?g jquery calculation plugin
[07:15:36] <caniuse> ajpiano: jQuery Calculation Plug-in - http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/calculation/calculation.plugin.htm
[07:16:15] <Birliban> ajpiano, ok, then nothing built in. thanks for the hint
[07:16:17] <prodserver> ok
[07:16:21] <prodserver> well i got new idea
[07:16:30] <prodserver> how do u remove all the html inside a div ?

[07:16:55] <hlveheart> ajpiano, you're too kind
[07:17:01] <hlveheart> I'd of shoved google on him
[07:17:06] <hlveheart> :S
[07:17:28] <WebDragon> easy enough to use the bot to point to the relevant docs
[07:17:43] <WebDragon> which also shows them the api page so they can search that directly in the future
[07:17:52] <hlveheart> but they won't lol
[07:17:59] <hlveheart> especially him.
[07:18:26] <WebDragon> hey, it could happen!
[07:18:35] <sunbeam> is jquery an acceptable way atm for handling forms (simple subscribe form) ?
[07:20:12] <prodserver> emptying the dom didnt work
[07:20:21] <prodserver> ok ill use jsfiddle
[07:27:50] <Oniklus> hello all. I have a question regarding jqgrid. I use the pager edit button to edit the rows in the jqgrid table, but I want a particular row to be not editable. how would I be able to do this?
[07:29:03] <WebDragon> ?stop
[07:29:03] <caniuse> WebDragon: http://i.imgur.com/XOUfd.png
[07:29:03] <caniuse> WebDragon: .stop(): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[07:29:11] <prodserver> does empty remove js too?
[07:29:33] <prodserver> cause its still not working when i call empty before loading the page the second time.  which is wierd
[07:31:41] <pats_Toms> hi, anyone have any idea how to select elements if I have only first symbols of them. For example I have divs #image1, #image2... I want to select all of then with one selector.
[07:32:35] <WebDragon> ajpiano: got a sec on a stop() question?
[07:32:53] <WebDragon> I thought I'd solved this the right way but I seem to be missing something crucial
[07:37:34] <WebDragon> anyone?
[07:37:50] <ajpiano> WebDragon: sorry was afk, whats up
[07:38:12] <WebDragon> ajpiano: heya. I got this slider I built with custom post types in wordpress (which worked a treat!)
[07:38:23] <prodserver> does jquery provide something where it writes html to a div?
[07:38:35] <WebDragon> but for some reason multi-clicking on the pick-it nav causes the slides to overlay sometimes, eventhough I have stop(true,true) on them
[07:38:45] <Birliban> prodserver, ?html
[07:39:06] <WebDragon> ajpiano: site's here: http://360.client-proof.com/ and script here http://360.client-proof.com/wp-content/themes/360marketing/js/slidebar.js
[07:39:48] <Birliban> ?html @podserver
[07:39:49] <caniuse> Birliban: .html(): Set the HTML contents of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[07:39:55] <WebDragon> click rapidly in the pick-it and you get a melange of slides instead of just one
[07:40:23] <WebDragon> and then they keep overlaying as the slides continue
[07:40:51] <WebDragon> I had _thought_ that stop(true,true) would resolve that but apparently I missed something
[07:41:03] <pats_Toms> hi, anyone have any idea how to select elements if I have only first symbols of them. For example I have divs #image1, #image2... I want to select all of then with one selector.
[07:41:15] <WebDragon> or I'm DoingItWrongâ„¢

[07:41:23] <caniuse> pats_Toms: Attribute Starts With Selector [name^="value"]: Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value beginning exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/

[07:42:19] <WebDragon> I really wish that [thing^=value] worked in cases like class="something value-1 something" as well as class="value-1 something something"
[07:42:27] <Qalqi> hello my bulbuls
[07:42:29] <ajpiano> WebDragon: you don't have a call to stop in your handler for the "pickits"
[07:42:32] <ajpiano> so far as i can tell
[07:42:33] <WebDragon> it doesn't separate the elements in the attribute
[07:43:03] * WebDragon blinks
[07:43:09] * WebDragon goes to look at the code again
[07:43:16] <WebDragon> fresh sets of eyes
[07:44:22] <WebDragon> ajpiano: so I seem to have left out the slideitems.each( function () { $(this).stop(true,true) }); from the pickit click
[07:44:36] <WebDragon> un be lievable
[07:44:46] <ajpiano> :|
[07:44:49] <WebDragon> and this is AFTER a half a cuppa dragoncoffee
[07:44:54] <WebDragon> xD
[07:45:11] <WebDragon> thanks bro .. I hate it when I can't see the forest for the trees
[07:46:07] <WebDragon> also left out the stopPropagation()
[07:49:56] <rroelofs> WebDragon: got a recipe for dragonCoffee?
[07:50:08] <hlveheart> what's dragonCoffee?
[07:50:30] <WebDragon> rroelofs: start with a good bean (ethiopian yrgacheffe is a good one. you pronounce that OMG)
[07:50:44] <WebDragon> then get yourself a countertop cappuccino/espresso maker
[07:50:53] <WebDragon> use double the water and a really big cup
[07:51:12] <WebDragon> instead of a densely packed espresso, you get more of a sort of cafe robusto
[07:51:37] <prodserver> is there something like load()  but u can put in html string?
[07:51:45] <WebDragon> easy on the sugar -- I suggest a flavored creamer that's got some sweet in it (international delight hazelnut creamer for example)
[07:51:56] <WebDragon> use a burr grinder rather than a blade grinder
[07:52:05] <prodserver> i mean instead of a url from another page
[07:52:09] <rroelofs> Ah I see.  sounds yummy.
[07:52:13] <WebDragon> if you're really obsessive you can buy your beans green and roast them yourself
[07:52:33] <WebDragon> rroelofs: I discovered the trick with the espresso maker when I broke my coffeepot
[07:52:59] <rroelofs> I'm not that obsessive.  but we do have a roaster in town where you can go to get it roasted to whatever spec you want
[07:53:01] <WebDragon> had a REALLY BIG mug for my coffee, but when I used the amount of water it's suited for with the 2x cups espresso amount of coffee, it came out ZOMG
[07:53:16] <pats_Toms> any one know how to get div id name from "this"?
[07:53:29] <WebDragon> $(this).attr("id") ?
[07:53:59] <pats_Toms> yes, but in variable
[07:54:00] <rroelofs> pats_Toms:  this is already the elemnt, so this.id should alos work
[07:54:16] <rroelofs> assuming you re in an event handler
[07:54:20] <pats_Toms> like, name = this.attr("id");
[07:54:37] <ajpiano> pats_Toms: var name = this.id;
[07:54:45] <pats_Toms> mhm, thanks
[07:54:50] <rroelofs> I swear I want a t-shirt with the slogan "What is 'this'"?
[07:55:08] <SDuncan> morning folks

[08:17:04] <jasonfarrell> yeah it does, i was just hoping to avoid getting a web server on this box :(
[08:17:25] <jasonfarrell> anyone got any recommendations for a server not named apache?
[08:17:25] <SDuncan> story of my life.
[08:17:27] <systemfault> You should have a web server for any serious development..
[08:17:52] <jeffsmykil> IIS?
[08:17:58] <jasonfarrell> on a mac
[08:18:13] <jeffsmykil> iis in a  vm?
[08:18:18] <SDuncan> jason are you ok with apache if it's buried in a package?
[08:18:18] <jasonfarrell> too much work :)
[08:18:31] <jasonfarrell> SDuncan: yeah, i am actually checking the appstore right now see if they have it in package format
[08:18:33] <SDuncan> something like MAMP
[08:18:37] <Logikos> if i had <div id="someid"> </div> and within it were serveral child divs, and i wanted to set the opacity of all child divs except for the first child, to 0, how might i do that?
[08:18:40] * jasonfarrell doesn't install much on this mach
[08:18:40] <systemfault> jasonfarrell: You have a mac?
[08:18:44] <jasonfarrell> systemfault: yeam
[08:18:46] <jasonfarrell> *yeah
[08:18:54] <systemfault> jasonfarrell: Then apache should already be installed (Not 100% sure)
[08:19:02] <jasonfarrell> checking
[08:19:03] <ajpiano> jasonfarrell: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
[08:19:07] <ajpiano> jasonfarrell: run it in any directory
[08:19:18] <SDuncan> @logikos that'd be a css thing mostly
[08:19:19] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: if you could take a look at this I would be very greatful http://jsfiddle.net/PMERc/14/
[08:19:21] <ajpiano> and you will get a dead simple webserver running in the directory when you run it
[08:19:22] <jasonfarrell> yeah i see apache on here
[08:19:30] <jasonfarrell> but i like what ajpiano is selling :)
[08:19:36] <prodserver> hi
[08:19:41] <celeritas> nginx
[08:19:41] <prodserver> instead of function()
[08:19:42] <ajpiano> jasonfarrell: but no PHP, donno if you need that
[08:19:55] <jasonfarrell> no module named SimpleHTTPServer
[08:19:58] <jasonfarrell> err wiat
[08:20:02] <jasonfarrell> sorry, i can't spell :)
[08:20:06] <ajpiano> :)
[08:20:09] <systemfault> PHP 5.4 supposely has a built-in webserver :P
[08:20:14] <SDuncan> @jasonfarrell php and apache all install nicely with MAMP if that's helpful
[08:20:15] <prodserver> i mean $(function () ) which makes it load every time is there something in jquery that runs only once?
[08:20:16] <jasonfarrell> and there it goes
[08:20:31] <jasonfarrell> ajpiano: how do i specify document root?
[08:20:32] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: what am i looking at
[08:20:38] <prodserver> run once per load i mean
[08:20:46] <ajpiano> jasonfarrell: whereevery you execute that command is what the document root will be
[08:20:51] <jasonfarrell> SDuncan: thanks, ill keep that in mind
[08:20:52] <jasonfarrell> ahh
[08:20:53] <jasonfarrell> nice
[08:20:56] <jasonfarrell> thanks ajpiano
[08:21:02] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: upon pusing the center button the yellow dot should be centered along with the red box
[08:21:55] <jasonfarrell> ahh now it works :)
[08:21:56] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: why are you trying to do this with relative position and margin instead of just positioning it absolute?
[08:22:02] <jasonfarrell> someone MIGHT want to add that to the docs
[08:22:14] <jasonfarrell> or am I the only one who plays with Javascript on file:// :)
[08:22:16] <jeffsmykil> because I need to put that yellow square on the "map" in an absolute position
[08:23:14] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: there is no code here even manipulating the position of the #person
[08:23:56] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: right it is attached to the relatively positioned #map
[08:24:32] <ajpiano> jasonfarrell: what should be in the docs for what?  the fact that you need an actual webserver to test ajax?
[08:24:38] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: i'm confused
[08:24:49] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: if you are confused im screwed
[08:25:04] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: you haven't written any code to manipulate the position of the thing that you want to reposition
[08:25:14] <jeffsmykil> the #person gets an absolute position on the #map
[08:25:20] <jeffsmykil> I am trying to move the #map
[08:25:20] <ajpiano> right...
[08:25:30] <jasonfarrell> ajpiano: granted that is obvious,  but I wasn't aware i had encountered ajax yet.  Perhaps just a warning like "Warning: since this is using AJAX to show the dialog, you'll want to be running off a webserver"
[08:25:32] <ajpiano> ohh
[08:25:43] <jasonfarrell> ajpiano: on further inspection, it was my error clearly
[08:25:46] <prodserver> $(document).ready(function () {          $("#tabs").tabs();     });
[08:25:52] <ajpiano> jasonfarrell: that would not be the right place to put that documentation i don't think
[08:25:54] <prodserver> how do i make sure tabs is only ran once?
[08:26:06] <ajpiano> prodserver: it will only be run once
[08:26:09] <prodserver> if i load it into a div and display the dialog
[08:26:12] <ajpiano> unless you load and execute the same code again for some reason
[08:26:15] <jasonfarrell> ajpiano: you're right, perhaps somewhere on the Quick Start or something.  Just so people are in that frame when they hit the main examples
[08:26:20] <ajpiano> you shouldn't be ajaxing in content that has scripts you don't want executed
[08:26:22] <pats_Toms> hi, is there any way to load Nivo slider with ajax?
[08:26:23] <ajpiano> if you don't want the scripts executed
[08:26:25] <prodserver> well i load it into a dialog
[08:26:36] <ajpiano> jasonfarrell: you can file an issue on the jquery mobile repo
[08:26:39] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: was that "ohh" to me?
[08:26:42] <ajpiano> prodserver: then don't
[08:26:50] <jasonfarrell> ajpiano: will doâ€¦. when I have time :)
[08:26:51] <prodserver> how do i make the dialog which has tabs in it work
[08:26:57] <jasonfarrell> thanks again for the assist, i like this simple server
[08:26:58] <prodserver> i need that script on that page
[08:27:08] <jasonfarrell> apache seemed like overkill for this case
[08:27:09] <prodserver> with the tabs but i load that page into a dialog
[08:27:17] <ajpiano> prodserver: you do it by doing it. i don't understand how the code would be executed twice
[08:27:29] <ajpiano> prodserver: the page that has all that behaviour on it should have *all* the javascript
[08:27:43] <ajpiano> it shouldn't be that the dialog loads a page with script in it that then controls itself inside of the dialog
[08:28:03] <prodserver> onclick="javascript:   $('#dialogtab').load('ConfigureSelect/@Model.CompanyConfig.ConfigId'); $('#dialogtab').dialog({ modal: true, height: 250 }); "
[08:28:10] <prodserver> thats is the code use to load the dialog
[08:28:16] <prodserver> is thre something wrong with that?
[08:28:20] <ajpiano> so much
[08:28:39] <prodserver> whats wrong with it?
[08:28:48] <ajpiano> the way that it's architected
[08:28:53] <ajpiano> using onclick javascript
[08:28:58] <prodserver> onclick="javascript:   $('#dialogtab').load('ConfigureSelect/@Model.CompanyConfig.ConfigId').dialog({ modal: true, height: 250 }); "
[08:29:06] <prodserver> why orginal code is this
[08:29:08] <ajpiano> using the loaded page as the "callback" intead of having an actual callback
[08:29:21] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: does what I am trying to do make sense now?
[08:29:32] <prodserver> i dont understand what you mean by the call backs?
[08:30:13] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: not entirely sure really *what* you are trying to center relative to what.  does it work any better if you do margin-top instead of margin-bottom?
[08:30:30] <ajpiano> prodserver: are you familiar with the term "callback" and its connection to the use of Ajax
[08:30:33] <jeffsmykil> yes but margin-top doesn't work in IE
[08:30:36] <prodserver> ajpiano:  is there a way so my script isnt loaded twice?
[08:30:45] <prodserver> im not using ajax
[08:30:57] <ajpiano> yes you are
[08:31:00] <ajpiano> what do you think .load() does
[08:31:01] <prodserver> oh ok
[08:31:36] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: wasn
[08:31:44] <prodserver> how do i make it so the script for the tabs which are on the configureselect page isnt loaded twice?
[08:32:04] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: wasn't sure if you knew why margin-bottom wasn't working in this instance or if you had a better idea how to do this
[08:32:55] <ajpiano> prodserver: you have to make it so that it actually only calls tabs on the thing that just loaded
[08:33:04] <ajpiano> instead of a blanket $("#tabs").tabs() every time you request anything
[08:33:20] <ajpiano> prodserver: your application, as is, is not architected in such a way to facilitate what you're trying to do being particularly effective
[08:33:53] <prodserver> how do i fix it?
[08:34:13] <prodserver> where should i move the $('#tabs').tabs() to?
[08:34:24] <ajpiano> it should be in the callback of the load call
[08:34:30] <prodserver> ok
[08:34:39] <astkfour> i have a countdown and i want to format the diaply this way minutes:seconds -> 00:00 right i am trying to add a 0 infront of any single digit using this if (seconds.length = 1) {seconds = "0" + seconds;} but it adds a 0 infront of single and double digits so 50 seconds would be 050 any ideas how to fix this?
[08:34:52] <ajpiano> prodserver: and don't use an ID, use a class
[08:34:53] <ajpiano> and then you can just do $(this).find(".tabs").tabs()
[08:35:02] <ajpiano> then it will only set the tabs inside of the dialog that just loaded
[08:35:20] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: not really sure why
[08:35:27] <ajpiano> 3rd party position debugging is the worst
[08:35:42] <gnarf> astkfour: a) your if uses an assignment operator instead of == / === to test equality
[08:35:57] <prodserver> how do i add the js to the callback of the load call?
[08:36:07] <astkfour> ah ok let me try those and see what happens
[08:36:07] <gnarf> astkfour: b) make sure "seconds" is a string when that gets called... i.e. seconds += "";
[08:36:34] <astkfour> its not a string
[08:36:52] <gnarf> astkfour: then it wont have a length property
[08:36:57] <ajpiano> prodserver: you have to learn to use the documentation
[08:37:00] <gnarf> why not just check seconds < 10
[08:37:12] <ajpiano> $("#foo").load("url", function() { doSomething();  });
[08:37:31] <astkfour> i didnt think of that let me try that
[08:37:36] <ajpiano> prodserver: or, more accurately, you should be receiving support from your employer on how to approach problems like this
[08:38:09] <prodserver> ajpiano
[08:38:20] <prodserver> the do something part
[08:38:30] <astkfour> perfect! that worked thanks for the tip
[08:38:33] <prodserver> what should i do there?
[08:38:38] <PavelloZ|home> :o
[08:38:40] <ajpiano> that's where you would do the tabs
[08:38:53] <prodserver> is there something in jquery that loads it only once?
[08:39:01] <PavelloZ|home> i wish i had half the patience ajpiano has
[08:39:24] <ajpiano> prodserver: you don't *want* it to "load only once
[08:39:37] <prodserver> ok
[08:39:39] <ajpiano> you want to load the right dialog every time, and then apply tabs to the new content every time
[08:39:53] <ajpiano> prodserver: unfortunately i don't have the bandwidth to be able to walk you through doing this all right now
[08:40:04] <prodserver> seems pretty complicated
[08:40:19] <prodserver> should i load all the pages on the host page and hide it
[08:40:25] <ajpiano> prodserver: do you work somewhere where someone else with more JS experience can help you solve this?
[08:40:26] <prodserver> using display : none
[08:40:38] <prodserver> and not use load
[08:41:11] <prodserver> no unfortunately no
[08:41:38] <ajpiano> that's a real bummer, seems you are in a bit of a pickle then
[08:41:49] <prodserver> well tahts what i thought i was doing with my tabs script on the page itself
[08:42:03] <prodserver> when it loads a new page it will run the script
[08:42:17] <ajpiano> but when that script runs it affects the ENTIRE page you're loading it into
[08:42:18] <prodserver> or does it only run it the first time?
[08:42:49] <prodserver> i dont get the problem exactly is it because the script runs twice or is it because it only runs the first time?
[08:43:01] <hlveheart> brbs
[08:43:33] <ajpiano> i genuinely have no idea
[08:43:39] <prodserver> ok
[08:43:42] <ajpiano> i'm not the one running the code
[08:43:45] <prodserver> well i think i got an idea
[08:43:47] <ajpiano> how am i supposed to know what the problem is
[08:43:49] <prodserver> where i wont use load
[08:43:58] <ajpiano> ok, good luck
[08:44:08] <prodserver> im just gonna load all the dialogs
[08:44:13] <prodserver> on the host page and hide them
[08:45:34] <whoev> how do i get the date that a cookie was created with jquery?
[08:55:17] <pats_Toms> hi, is there any way to get alert when .html content loading is complited?
[08:55:26] <pats_Toms> tb alert()
[08:57:30] <[jasper]> hej guys, when I run a .load ....I can get a callback....will this callback be called when the dom is ready?
[08:57:33] <[jasper]> or just when the load is complete?
[08:57:45] <sunbeam> loading the jquery lib from google (instead of having it on your server) - is it ok?
[08:57:49] <pats_Toms> no, i had that problem hour ago :/
[08:58:01] <pats_Toms> to jasper
[09:01:33] <westg> why deosn't this: http://jsfiddle.net/3QEbE/ go to jQuery.com?
[09:02:24] <pats_Toms> "The website does not permit its content to be displayed in a frame. It must be displayed in a separate window."
[09:06:31] <Grafica> I'm want to use this time picker on my Website http://jongsma.org/software/protoplasm/control/timepicker, but it was set up with an old version of HTML, and I'm using HTML5. I don't know javascript, but the code referencing the javascript needs to be changed to be compatible with HTML5. Where can I paste some code to ask a specific question? Thanks.
[09:06:57] <PavelloZ|home>  ?demo
[09:07:31] <Grafica> Pavelloz|home: R u talking 2 me?
[09:07:57] <PavelloZ|home> yeah, i cant remember which channel got a bot which helps with that
[09:08:07] <PavelloZ|home> anyway - http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:08:09] <PavelloZ|home> there you go
[09:11:24] <[jasper]> pats_Toms ?
[09:14:30] <Grafica> PavelloZ: I just have a question about converting some older HTML code to HTML5, like how would "<script language="javascript"> Protoplasm.use('timepicker').transform('input.timepicker'); </script>" read in HTML5?
[09:16:03] <systemfault> The same? Except that the "language" attribute of script is deprecated IIRC.
[09:16:36] <systemfault> <script type="text/javascript">code here</script> is the way you should do it
[09:17:48] <PavelloZ|home> actually u can even skip the type one
[09:18:13] <systemfault> True :)
[09:18:39] <Grafica> systemfault: Hmmm, I've been coding it without the script type, like "<script src="js/modernizr.js"></script>"
[09:19:10] <systemfault> If it's a file, it's the good way to do it.
[09:19:25] <systemfault> My example was for inline code like your first example.
[09:19:26] <tw2113> win
[09:19:42] <tw2113> for both skipping the type declaration and modernizr
[09:19:50] <Grafica> systemfault: O I C.
[09:20:14] <systemfault> Nothing wrong with declaring the type...
[09:20:19] <systemfault> But yeah, modernizr is a must
[09:20:34] <systemfault> normalize.css too IMHO
[09:20:51] <Parhs> i tried to use Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'easeInOutCirc'
[09:20:53] <Parhs> i get this error
[09:20:58] <tw2113> i recently switched to normalize.css
[09:20:59] <Parhs> although i included jquery ui
[09:21:02] <Grafica> I'll have to check out normalize.
[09:21:17] <tw2113> but will be hard to keep up with its development at times because i deleted a lof of their spacing
[09:21:19] <prodserver> ok
[09:21:46] <tw2113> my god the white space abuse in that file
[09:21:47] <systemfault> tw2113: I never "modify" normalize.css, I build on it.
[09:22:03] <prodserver> i got the data back from my callback function in load .   how do i look in data and apply $('#tabs').tabs() to the data?
[09:22:12] <tw2113> i'm a rebel
[09:22:15] <systemfault> :D
[09:23:06] <PavelloZ|home> i just replaced my reset.css with normalize and i didnt noticed any major changes if any
[09:25:35] <tw2113> that means its working
[09:25:48] <tw2113> unless you simply renamed the file :P
[09:29:52] <tw2113> oops, heh
[09:30:07] <tw2113> i wasn't completely sure which room i was in. I imagined I was in #wordpress
[09:30:33] <prodserver> how do i apply js on a callback data item after find
[09:31:34] <prodserver> onclick="javascript:   $('#dialogtab').load('ConfigureSelect/@Model.CompanyConfig.ConfigId', function (data) { $(data).find('#tabs').tabs(); }).dialog({ modal: true, height: 250 }); "
[09:31:42] <prodserver> can i do that to apply tabs();
[09:33:31] <sphinxxx> prodserver:  theres no callback on find
[09:35:06] <binaryfus10nz> anyone know what its called when you have like a 300px height div and 800px picture that moves up/down ?
[09:35:07] <prodserver> sphinxxx:   im talkin bout onclick="javascript:   $('#dialogtab').load('ConfigureSelect/@Model.CompanyConfig.ConfigId', function (data) { $(data).find('#tabs').tabs(); }).dialog({ modal: true, height: 250 }); "
[09:35:13] <binaryfus10nz> I've seen them just not sure what its called to search for it
[09:36:01] <sphinxxx> what about it?
[09:36:05] <ajpiano> prodserver: you don't want to do $(data).find()
[09:36:14] <ajpiano> prodserver: you want to find the ones that are actually inside of the dom already
[09:36:20] <westg> why is jsfiddle blocking links to google.com
[09:36:21] <westg> weird
[09:36:27] <westg> and yahoo and jquery
[09:37:21] <binaryfus10nz> ajpiano, u know what im talking about?
[09:37:51] <ajpiano> a content slider?
[09:38:56] <prodserver> oh
[09:39:19] <sphinxxx> binaryfus10nz: zoom?
[09:42:31] <binaryfus10nz> not zoom sphinxxx its morel ike a slideshow
[09:42:38] <binaryfus10nz> but the pic moves up/down inside of a container
[09:42:58] <prodserver> ok
[09:43:00] <prodserver> so i didi
[09:43:01] <prodserver> onclick="javascript:   $('#dialogtab').load('ConfigureSelect/@Model.CompanyConfig.ConfigId', function (data) { $('#tabs').tabs(); }).dialog({ modal: true, height: 250 }); "
[09:43:20] <prodserver> taht only still works for the first time .  the second time doesnt work
[09:43:35] <prodserver> what else can i do?
[09:43:43] <ajpiano> prodserver: you need to NOT use an id
[09:43:46] <ajpiano> for the tabs
[09:43:59] <ajpiano> dupliate IDs is bad news
[09:44:01] <prodserver> i tried using class and that made my whole page blank
[09:44:28] <prodserver> for tabs?
[09:44:29] <prodserver> ok
[09:45:31] <binaryfus10nz> this one kinda has it sphinxxx  http://tobia.github.com/CrossSlide/
[09:45:58] <sphinxxx> binaryfus10nz: an image slider?
[09:46:07] <binaryfus10nz> u see how some MOVE inside
[09:46:13] <binaryfus10nz> where the pic is larger than container
[09:47:14] <tw2113> i imagine it just sets the image as the background and then moves its x/y coordinates
[09:47:49] <sphinxxx> its just an image slider plugin with certain options

[10:36:16] <mephux> has anyone ever ran into a jquery selector returning the matches once and the second time []

[10:40:39] <dilvie> seems to work

[10:41:22] <min|dvir|us-work> Anyone?
[10:45:18] <StephenS> hello I need help
[10:45:39] <chee> StephenS: with what!
[10:45:51] <StephenS> I have a input boxes which call js and, I need to do via jquery next: To store temporarly variables and then to process it with PHP
[10:46:05] <StephenS> now I know how to process it with php, but I am struggling to store it temporarly with jquery
[10:48:14] <StephenS> chee ?
[10:49:28] <gnarf> um?
[10:49:47] <dilvie> jeffsmykil: I don't know if there's native support for z-index positioning inside one canvas element, but I can think of a few ways you could roll your own z-index in canvas... for example, you could check out some old 2d parallaxing tutorials... we used to roll that z-index stuff ourselves all the time in the game dev world. =)  http://bit.ly/Hm5nUp
[10:49:53] <gnarf> StephenS: can you try describing that again? it's quite vague
[10:50:00] <gnarf> or maybe too literal
[10:50:09] <gnarf> i can't decide
[10:51:02] <StephenS> hm
[10:51:20] <citizenkeys> on pinterest, when you scroll down and the "Pinners you follow" bar stays to the top, what is that effect called?
[10:51:49] <chee> fixed elements ?
[10:51:56] <citizenkeys> like when you scroll down on a website and a table row heading or something stays at the top once its at the top, what's that effect called?
[10:52:33] <citizenkeys> yeah? it becomes a fixed position element.  but it's not fixed position until you scroll where it's at the top.   there's gotta be a name for that effect?
[10:53:36] <gnarf> citizenkeys: oh - maybe "sticky sidebar" or somethng
[10:57:47] <citizenkeys> gnarf: yeah? apparently they call it sticky sidebar...
[10:59:03] <citizenkeys> or a sticky scroller.
[10:59:25] <StephenS> gnarf I have an id: <input type="text" id="test"> and script bla.js
[10:59:39] <StephenS> now I need to temporary store that variable of test in js
[10:59:41] <StephenS> or jquery
[10:59:53] <citizenkeys> and here's a good example of how to do a sticky scroller: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4907872/changing-an-elements-css-position-after-scrolling-down-the-page
[11:01:02] <Lobosque> there's an aside element in this page that does not appear in chrome. Anyone knows why? http://www.idearium.net.br/mads/advertisements/create
[11:01:10] <Lobosque> sorry! wrong channel!
[11:03:08] <Lobosque> I have an ajax request that works well in firefox, but always fail in chrome.. anyone knows why that happens?
[11:10:10] <min|dvir|us-work> What's a better way to write line 11? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/577074/
[11:13:05] <tw2113> wouldn't the $hiddenIFrame reference on line 11 be better as $this ?
[11:13:11] <tw2113> since you're in that event already
[11:14:48] <gnarf> StephenS: var test = $("#test").val() ?
[11:14:51] <min|dvir|us-work> tw2113, there's no $this.
[11:15:11] <gehsekky> i think he just means "this"
[11:15:19] <gehsekky> but we're in #jquery so he got all excited
[11:15:21] <tw2113> probably mixing up my js and php
[11:15:34] <gehsekky> premature-prefixation
[11:16:13] <min|dvir|us-work> `this` doesn't have a contents() method.
[11:16:24] <gehsekky> yea, so you have to $(this) it
[11:16:34] <aJacom> $('#div').html() changes the innerHTML of a certain element, but what if I want that new html to fade in? Is it ok to use $div('#div').html('newhtml').fadeIn('slow'); ?
[11:16:35] <min|dvir|us-work> gehsekky, but why, if I already have a reference?
[11:16:45] <min|dvir|us-work> That was a rhetorical question.
[11:16:50] <min|dvir|us-work> What's a better way to write line 11? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/577074/
[11:18:38] <min|dvir|us-work> It doesn't seem to display right and feels like a hack.
[11:20:48] <wish^> Hi, i made a sprite in photoshop and made a menu using css positioning.. It works perfectly, the buttons change when i hover over them, but is there any way i can make the selected page always show that button the same as if its being hovered over?
[11:21:58] <iateadonut> i'm traversing up a table column and turning the val('') in a bunch of input fields... i'm doing it like this: $(node).parent().parent().prev('tr').prev('tr').children('td').next('td').children('input').val('').parent().parent().prev('tr').children('td').next('td').children('input').val('');   ... is there an easier way or should i just be going up like this?
[11:24:12] <rroelofs> iateadonut: there's likely a better way but we'll need to see code.  can you create a fiddle?
[11:27:26] <blazedd> I've been searching for a long time, but the search term "jquery gallery" is overflooded with results now. Is there a plugin to handle an interface similar to this: http://puu.sh/oehF
[11:30:37] <iateadonut> rroelofs, http://jsfiddle.net/BjfDT/, but i embarrasingly don't really know how to bind an event to an <a> element without using 'onclick';  i think that's why it doesn't work here.
[11:30:50] <StephenS> how to echo var in jqyeru?
[11:31:02] <iateadonut> echo?
[11:31:14] <iateadonut> do you mean alert for debugging, or do you mean you want it to show up on the page somehwere?
[11:31:16] <tw2113> print ?
[11:32:44] <bsm_nate1> Is there a way to tell JQM to "enhance" a div again?  I show some content, update the div, then need to format the markup again.
[11:32:56] <blazedd> anyone have any idea of a plugin to acomplish this: http://www.webdesignshock.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/jQueryplugin27_thumb.jpg
[11:33:05] <tw2113> appendto() mabe StephenS
[11:33:11] <sphinxxx> bsm_nate1: that depends what you're doing with the div
[11:33:19] <sphinxxx> if its just normal html, it should update automatically
[11:33:20] <ajpiano> bsm_nate1: most of the jqm widgets have a "refresh" method
[11:33:22] <ajpiano> you can call
[11:33:28] <ajpiano> after you add new stuff
[11:33:32] <sphinxxx> yea what ajpiano said
[11:33:47] <tw2113> blazedd why not go to the source of that image and follow the tutorial?
[11:33:51] <bsm_nate1> sphinxxx: ajpiano: its a list element.  I'm emptying it out, then adding a bunch of new <li>'s
[11:34:20] <blazedd> tw2113: that is a mockup of a design, and I find find a plugin for the life of me, trying to save time, but I'm about to make it myself
[11:34:21] <ajpiano> http://www.elijahmanor.com/2011/02/dynamically-appending-elements-to.html
[11:34:59] <bsm_nate1> ajpiano: Just what I was looking for, thanks!
[11:37:01] <sphinxxx> .listview( "refresh" );    is what you want
[11:39:12] <raj> what's the difference btwn using .done() and just putting a function after the original function?
[11:39:12] <Mdgmdm> #-o
[11:41:39] <ajpiano> raj:  $.ajax().done(function(){}) will make sure the code runs *after* the request has actualyl completed
[11:41:57] <ajpiano> whereas $.ajax() someFunction() means someFunction will happen *before* the ajax call has completed
[11:42:14] <raj> ah, ok, understood
[11:42:16] <raj> thank you
[11:43:37] <iateadonut> http://jsfiddle.net/BjfDT/3/ - here it is, bound to the element.  two questions... 1) is there a better way to traverse the DOM?   2) how can you bind and still use the javascript 'this' variable?
[11:43:40] <iateadonut> rroelofs
[11:44:06] <ajpiano> omg
[11:44:30] <raj> iateadonut, you can define 'this' as 'self' earlier
[11:44:33] <raj> and then just use self
[11:44:44] <ajpiano> iateadonut: you can also use event.target instead of 'this'
[11:44:52] <ajpiano> if you want to override what 'this' is for whatever reason
[11:44:57] <ajpiano> iateadonut: this is insane traversal btw
[11:45:11] <ajpiano> like, literally insane
[11:45:37] <ajpiano> iateadonut: why not just like... $("#form").find("input").val("")
[11:45:40] <xec> i like it, it's like a puzzle. or a maze
[11:45:52] <blindMoe> hehe
[11:46:09] <iateadonut> because there are about 100 of these tables on a single page.
[11:46:31] <ajpiano> iateadonut: find the inputs in the one you want to clear and clear them
[11:46:56] <ajpiano> you don't have to literally take the slowestmost specific traversal path to somehow ensure that that won't happen
[11:47:48] <iateadonut> yes, that's my question.
[11:47:56] <ajpiano> well there's your answer
[11:48:13] <ajpiano> what you have here is pretty much a terrible idea
[11:48:31] <ajpiano> $("rootElement").find("input").val("") is what you want
[11:49:00] <iateadonut> thanks, ajpiano
[11:50:18] <rroelofs> iateadonut: I'm glad you got an answer.  real work pulled me away
[11:52:15] <iateadonut> thanks to you too, rroelofs, but i actually didn't understand your answer about defining this as self, which i'll have to google later.
[11:52:26] <iateadonut> i'm sure you put me on the right path, though.  thanks.
[11:52:40] <rroelofs> iateadonut: that wasn't me.  I think you could you could simplify by $(node).closest("table").find("input").val();
[11:52:59] <ajpiano> iateadonut: if you have hundreds of identical tables on the same page
[11:53:21] <ajpiano> you might, and when i say might, i mean definitely definitely definitely want to NOT use IDs
[11:53:33] <rroelofs> :-)
[11:54:42] <iateadonut> yup.  that works.
[11:54:46] <iateadonut> don't use id's?
[11:55:00] <sphinxxx> anyone know much about the google translate object?
[11:55:09] <ajpiano> ?multipleid
[11:55:10] <bot-t> ajpiano, #6030 (JQuery problems with multiple ID Selectors) – jQuery Core ... - Opened 9 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6030
[11:55:17] <ajpiano> ?duplicateid @ iateadonut
[11:55:18] <bot-t> iateadonut, .clone() - Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[11:55:21] <ajpiano> mehhhhh
[11:55:32] <ajpiano> iateadonut: ID's are required to be unique within the entire DOM
[11:55:55] <iateadonut> right.  each table has its own id and nothing else has an id.
[11:55:55] <min|dvir|us-work> I'd like to take the contents of an iframe and replace the current document with them. How?
[11:56:25] <sphinxxx> check for multiple IDs:  http://jsfiddle.net/B2DU5/
[11:56:32] <tw2113> is it just me, or would it be kind of fun to put console.log('$ is undefined') in some minified code and see how many people think they're getting an error but see the code working?
[11:56:59] <iateadonut> how could you tell if people think they're getting an error?
[11:57:23] <tw2113> have them come in asking about it? i dunno, it was a spur of the moment idea
[11:58:25] <ajpiano> iateadonut: so by "nothing else" you meant "every input element" right?
[11:58:26] <ajpiano> input id="nameOnCard"
[11:58:55] <iateadonut> oh
[11:58:57] <iateadonut> how about that.
[11:59:01] <sphinxxx> google translate a mystery to me still
[12:00:32] <Emn1ty> http://tinyurl.com/78e223m - Alright so this gallery here allows you to click the smaller images to change the larger one, and click the larger one to open a gallery. The issue I'm having is that in IE and FF the gallery won't open and I'm not sure why.
[12:01:36] <iateadonut> i'm doing this and it's not causing any errors: nameOnCard = $('#'+type+id+' #nameOnCard').val();  ... but i should change them all to:  nameOnCard = $('#'+type+id+' .nameOnCard').val();
[12:01:52] <iateadonut> or leave a little note to the developer who gets hired after i'm fired for stuff like this to change it.
[12:02:47] <rroelofs> ouch
[12:03:17] <ajpiano> yes, you should use classes
[12:03:37] <tw2113> classes and objects oh my
[12:03:40] <iateadonut> he'll probably appreciate that.
[12:04:05] <rroelofs> iateadonut: or jse input[name=...] since they already have names
[12:07:21] <Emn1ty> anyone?
[12:11:08] <someprimetime> anyone know if there is a way to disable the search box in the jquery chosen plugin?
[12:11:19] <someprimetime> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[12:11:29] <someprimetime> for the standard select
[12:16:04] <iateadonut> changed all to classes as it seemed easier to type '.' than [input=
[12:16:22] <nofxxx> Had anyone managed/tryed to get functionality similar to 'autotab' on mobile? By that I mean you set a char limit on a text input and focus() the next when the limit is reached. Problem is, darn ios and android>3 hides the darn keyboard when you focus another field!
[12:17:04] <nofxxx> not to mention how stupid the number and pattern stuff of html is on mobile, you just can't mask a field and have a numeric keyboard for instance...
[12:17:07] <prodserver> are u seriuos?
[12:17:27] <prodserver> what if ur phone has a hw keyboard
[12:18:37] <nofxxx> prodserver: then you can use my app w/o worry.
[12:18:56] <nofxxx> no one buys bb these days , don't even care about it tbh
[12:19:27] <prodserver> i dont get a bb
[12:19:38] <prodserver> i am talkin bout an andriod with a hw keyboard
[12:20:03] <prodserver> i mean does the problem go away if u had a native app?
[12:20:35] <someprimetime> nofxxx: that's terrible UI
[12:20:42] <someprimetime> to autofocus to the next input
[12:20:57] <someprimetime> ux* rather
[12:21:02] <someprimetime> but seriously that would piss me off
[12:21:14] <prodserver> his ui he designed would piss u off?
[12:21:20] <someprimetime> what?
[12:21:22] <someprimetime> re-read
[12:21:26] <nofxxx> prodserver: did not tryed this native, was trying to shortcut heh
[12:21:40] <prodserver> how come u didnt use rhomobile
[12:21:49] <nofxxx> someprimetime: this way improved work over 500%, and is making my app a good seller
[12:21:49] <prodserver> what are u using?
[12:21:55] <prodserver> jquery mobile?
[12:21:57] <someprimetime> you'd just bind to the keydown and do your logic inside of that
[12:22:01] <someprimetime> it's trivial to do
[12:22:03] <nofxxx> someprimetime: employee don't need to move the hand away from the numeric keypad
[12:22:24] <someprimetime> so if they typed something incorrectly, it'll still re-position me to the next field
[12:22:37] <someprimetime> in which case i have to re-focus the previous field
[12:22:51] <nofxxx> it's just a monkey job stuff, fiscal/financial they need to do... numbers/doocuments/money
[12:22:52] <prodserver> are u serious?
[12:23:04] <prodserver> and they want to do it on a phone?
[12:23:05] <nofxxx> someprimetime: I'm all ears for a suggestion tho
[12:23:31] <nofxxx> prodserver: why not, if it works nice it's a mobile numeric keypad =D
[12:23:44] <prodserver> oh
[12:23:54] <someprimetime> nofxxx: my suggestion is just to not do that. unless you are writing it for *you* personally and it helps improve your workflow, you can't expect everyone to have the same method of filling out forms
[12:23:59] <prodserver> are u making a keyboard?
[12:24:01] <someprimetime> then again i have no idea what it's even for
[12:25:07] <prodserver> well i got an idea
[12:25:15] <nofxxx> someprimetime: I don't agree man, if its really fixedchars autotab is HUGE improvement. for instance, documents, credit card.. something you want to mask
[12:25:17] <prodserver> do u want to hear it?
[12:25:38] <prodserver> mark the textbox type to numeric
[12:25:43] <someprimetime> cool. have fun pissing people off
[12:25:44] <nofxxx> prodserver: no, was trying to use the native keyb...
[12:25:59] <prodserver> then ios would keep the keyboard type to numeric
[12:26:09] <prodserver> instead of letters
[12:26:22] <prodserver> u are talkin bout the numpad right?
[12:26:36] <nofxxx> prodserver: yup
[12:27:41] <nofxxx> have a numeric keypad and mask it is another topic, and impossible too in html5. you can have 1.000.000 on a field for isntance. (two dots)
[12:28:01] <prodserver> so
[12:28:06] <prodserver> the numpad has dots
[12:28:38] <Emn1ty> Can anyone tell me why you can keep clicking over to the same image here? http://localhost/newportcoastauto/profile.php?vin=1FAFP45X02F161926
[12:28:41] <prodserver> i wish irc would put status messages on another window
[12:28:49] <prodserver> its hard to read convos with this constant interruptions
[12:28:56] <Emn1ty> just click on the large image and then click the back arrow.
[12:29:16] <prodserver> where?
[12:29:30] <prodserver> i dont see an image
[12:29:46] <Emn1ty> you don't see the picture of the car?
[12:30:09] <prodserver> no

[12:32:19] <prodserver> nice car site
[12:32:26] <Emn1ty> thanks
[12:32:44] <prodserver> u know the x on carfax is a little low?
[12:32:50] <prodserver> and a different color?
[12:33:28] <Emn1ty> that's their logo
[12:33:52] <prodserver> wow
[12:33:55] <prodserver> i cant believe it
[12:34:03] <Emn1ty> ... i feel I'm being trolled
[12:34:17] <prodserver> people jsut put an x in a different font as a logo these days?
[12:34:50] <devOlsen> as a branding logo?
[12:34:52] <devOlsen> think not.
[12:34:53] <Gotenks_ssj4> im running this script
[12:35:08] <prodserver> u dont think so?
[12:35:08] <Gotenks_ssj4> and i am with some problem
[12:35:25] <Gotenks_ssj4> the chat is loading only the last line
[12:35:33] <Gotenks_ssj4> and not the whole chat
[12:35:36] <devOlsen> as many clients I've worked with I've never been requested to have their logo be replaced with an X.
[12:35:57] <Emn1ty> what are you talking about?
[12:36:01] <Emn1ty> is an image broken?
[12:36:16] <Emn1ty> you are so freaking vague its not helping
[12:36:17] <Gotenks_ssj4> i want know if someone can help me making it work
[12:36:58] <tgodar> how do i do the following but have it do an exact match, not a 'contains' selector? jQuery(":button:contains('Save')").attr("disabled","disabled").addClass("ui-state-disabled");
[12:37:15] <prodserver> well do u consider it broken if there is an x that is offset?
[12:37:18] <prodserver> or not?
[12:37:33] <Emn1ty> no, I consider you an idiot looking for trouble
[12:37:42] <Emn1ty> if you aren't going to be helpful, shut up please
[12:37:53] <prodserver> well whats the problem?
[12:38:05] <prodserver> i dont get the issue
[12:38:13] <Emn1ty> http://www.google.com/search?q=carfax+logo&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=HUZ_T6_KJeTq2QXkm_XwBg&biw=1197&bih=954&sei=IUZ_T5PgC6mC2AXeys3rBg

[12:38:52] <Emn1ty> have you ever heard of carfax?
[12:38:55] <prodserver> yes
[12:39:00] <Emn1ty> then wtf
[12:39:09] <prodserver> why are u askin me this?
[12:39:30] <prodserver> i thought u had an problem
[12:39:38] <Emn1ty> prodserver: "u know the x on carfax is a little low?"
[12:39:50] <Emn1ty> you didn't even try to answer my question.
[12:39:52] <prodserver> ya
[12:40:06] <prodserver> well i was just mentioning but anyways
[12:40:09] <prodserver> what is ur problem
[12:40:11] <Emn1ty>  Can anyone tell me why you can keep clicking over to the same image here? http://www.newportcoastauto.com/profile.php?vin=1J8HH48K66C195983
[12:40:20] <prodserver> what do u mean?
[12:40:21] <Emn1ty> Click the larger image, and then click back
[12:40:25] <prodserver> clickin over the same image
[12:40:30] <prodserver> i dont click the same image
[12:40:36] <Emn1ty> It will gallery the same image multiple times
[12:40:55] <Emn1ty> do I need to get obnocxiously specific with you or should I just stop trying?
[12:41:01] <Emn1ty> obnoxiously*
[12:41:21] <prodserver> are u talkin bout the imagebox that pops up?
[12:41:24] <Emn1ty> yes
[12:41:31] <Emn1ty> click the back arrow
[12:41:32] <prodserver> and then u hit the left pointing arrow?
[12:41:44] <prodserver> back arrow in the browser or the imagepopup
[12:41:45] <Emn1ty> yes, and it gallaries the same image multiple times
[12:41:54] <Emn1ty> i guve up
[12:41:58] <Emn1ty> give*
[12:42:15] <Emn1ty> I can't believe they let trolls like you actually stay in the chat
[12:42:24] <tgodar> how do i do the following but have it do an exact match, not a 'contains' selector? jQuery(":button:contains('Save')").attr("disabled","disabled").addClass("ui-state-disabled");
[12:42:27] <chee> maybe it's his first day using jquery
[12:42:56] <chee> i know it's coldhead's
[12:43:03] <Emn1ty> anyone in their right mind knows what the back button does and that this has nothing to do with that
[12:43:25] <Emn1ty> the back button on the interface of the SITE
[12:43:28] <Emn1ty> not the damn browser
[12:46:07] <chee> do you think you could make a jsfiddle that shows the perblem? it's just there's a lot of stuff here. it's whatever is being run on the click of fancybox-left is it
[12:46:53] <prodserver> oh ok
[12:46:55] <prodserver> i got it
[12:46:56] <Emn1ty> Well i'm just not sure. Cuase fancybox is even set to cyclic. The only thing it could be is that I changed the css for fancybox because the "showNavArrows" wasn't working.
[12:46:57] <prodserver> sorry i was afk
[12:47:13] <prodserver> emn1ty: its because u are on the first image so it cant go back anymore
[12:47:22] <prodserver> thats why the same image keeps showing up when u hit back
[12:47:22] <Emn1ty> click back in the nav
[12:47:29] <prodserver> ya
[12:47:29] <Emn1ty> there are multiple of that image when you do so
[12:47:36] <prodserver> well
[12:47:36] <Emn1ty> go back, then forward again
[12:47:38] <prodserver> listen
[12:47:41] <prodserver> go forward
[12:47:59] <Emn1ty> nvm, not humoring you anymore
[12:48:48] <Emn1ty> chee: I think its the change to the css, but for whatever reason showNavArrows on fancybox doesn't seem to work. If I paste the old css in it works fine and it cycles properly but the arrows won't show at all times.
[12:49:20] <devOlsen> so this happens only when you change the css or leave the orignal css in tack?
[12:49:30] <Emn1ty> only when I change the css
[12:49:42] <Emn1ty> no
[12:49:45] <Emn1ty> I take that back
[12:50:14] <Emn1ty> hm...
[12:50:26] <Emn1ty> i'm can't think right now after all the bs from prod
[12:50:33] <Emn1ty> I need a lunch break
[12:50:44] <chee> i think you want to look at what array or whatever is being built
[12:51:12] <Emn1ty> perhaps, i'll see what's going on and come back after I try a few things
[12:51:17] <chee> that holds the image urls #fancybox-img
[12:51:57] <chee> and make sure it only adds something to the array when the #fancybar-left is clicked, if it isn't the same as the thing that's already there
[12:51:59] <chee> or similar
[12:52:21] <chee> but this is my first day using jquery
[12:53:38] <sphinxxx> can anyone explain to me what the micro SIM card in my sprint iPhone 4s does?
[12:54:17] <devOlsen> sphinxxx, let me get this clear, you want a jquery room to explain what a SIM card for your sprint iPhone 4 does?
[12:54:28] <devOlsen> am I the only one that fails to see logic there?
[12:54:43] <sphinxxx> yes, i do
[12:54:59] <sphinxxx> because its highly likely that someone in here has a sprint iPhone and knows the answer
[12:56:44] <chee> sphinxxx: ##iphone
[12:57:18] <sphinxxx> thanks chee
[12:57:23] <chee> also
[12:57:25] <chee> http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/10/sprint-wont-sell-iphone-4s-with-unlocked-micro-sim-card-slot.ars
[12:58:05] <chee> also https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sprint+iphone+4s+micro+sim+card
[12:58:38] <chee> it's strange to be in a different timezone
[12:58:52] <chee> i'm used to #jquery getting mean and weird during the witching hours
[12:59:02] <chee> now it gets mean and weird at lunch
[13:03:30] <sorahn> anyone here know if elements in spine controllers are supposed to be jquery elements?
[13:05:45] <raj> how can I select <a>mylink1</a> ? $("a[text='mylink1']") ?
[13:05:51] <chee> i don't think so, spine doesn't rely on jquery so i wouldn't imagine so, sorahn
[13:06:36] <johnkpaul> raj: I think it's contians
[13:06:36] <raj> doesn't work
[13:06:36] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[13:06:37] <johnkpaul> ?contains
[13:06:38] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[13:06:38] <raj> neither does value
[13:06:42] <sorahn> thanks chee :)
[13:06:54] <raj> ohh, i see, thanks johnkpaul
[13:07:11] <raj> is that considered slow johnkpaul ?
[13:10:01] <johnkpaul> raj: I don't think that anything is "considered slow", you have to take into account your entire app and what you're circumstances are to make that judgment
[13:10:45] <johnkpaul> I seem to remember that you are very very performance focused, but without making dozens of those queries, you probably won't notice any difference at all
[13:11:51] <raj> wel, I do have that in an each function for an array with about 80 elements
[13:12:41] <johnkpaul> eh, 80 is still pretty low, if you are concerned, I'd jsperf it
[13:12:47] <johnkpaul> or look for an existing jsperf
[13:12:58] <StephenS> how can I process jquerys variables with PHP?
[13:13:03] <raj> that's something I include in my project?
[13:13:10] <StephenS> I am trying with ajax to php but its not working
[13:13:11] <johnkpaul> if you want, it's pretty straightforward to use .filter() insead of :contains
[13:13:17] <johnkpaul> raj: http://www.jsperf.com
[13:13:34] <raj> oh right, I saw this site before
[13:15:04] <raj> oh boy, Tests
[13:15:14] <StephenS> some help?
[13:15:15] <raj> I didn't realize I needed to do that
[13:15:44] <raj> johnkpaul, filter() is the prefered method, performance-wise?
[13:15:57] <johnkpaul> raj: if you don't test, how will you know?
[13:16:07] <raj> i have yet to run a test in any language
[13:16:12] <johnkpaul> there is no "preferred method, performance wise"
[13:16:16] <raj> but god keeps bringing me back to it
[13:16:18] <johnkpaul> it's all dependenet on your situation
[13:16:23] <johnkpaul> why is god doing that?
[13:16:29] <johnkpaul> are you encountering speed issues?
[13:16:39] <raj> nope
[13:16:51] <raj> but 1 way or another, I keep getting nudged to run a test
[13:16:53] <johnkpaul> then this is paranoia? :)
[13:16:59] <raj> haha
[13:17:00] <raj> perhaps
[13:17:38] <johnkpaul> raj: jsperf is definitely good to know, I've used it when I've had to test speed in isolation, but it's very very rare that small performance differences affect the code that I write
[13:17:55] <raj> k
[13:17:58] <johnkpaul> if it's something gigantic, like appending to the dom in a loop rather than using createdocumentfragment
[13:18:02] <johnkpaul> then of course, I will do it the faster way
[13:18:16] <raj> umm, would you show me how to write a test then?
[13:18:16] <johnkpaul> if it's the difference of nanoseconds in thousnads of iterations, I don't worry about it
[13:18:26] <raj> just so I can see how it's done for future reference
[13:18:28] <johnkpaul> raj: jsperf has help pages and a faq
[13:18:35] <johnkpaul> read through them, and look at some other tests
[13:18:43] <johnkpaul> here's one that would interest you
[13:18:43] <johnkpaul> http://jsperf.com/jquery-contains-vs-filter
[13:19:02] <raj> ohh, nice
[13:20:51] <johnkpaul> also raj, when you look at that, take into account that it's only two browsers and FF is version 9
[13:21:02] <johnkpaul> some of the jsperf tests don't have good representations of the whole gamut
[13:21:15] <prodserver> hi
[13:21:16] <raj> ok, noted
[13:21:17] <prodserver> i am back
[13:21:46] <OldCode101> jquery 1.4.2 running datatables extension I get a "c" is undefined. I have run my code through jsHint and cant seem to find the issue with my ajax call
[13:22:33] <prodserver> are u getting a sprint iphone?
[13:22:49] <OldCode101> does anyone know if there is a minimum jquery version for datatables
[13:22:50] <OldCode101> ?
[13:22:52] <johnkpaul> OldCode101: switch to the unminified version
[13:22:59] <OldCode101> ok
[13:23:00] <johnkpaul> it might help knowing the real var name of "c"
[13:23:17] <supsup> who is c not a real var name!
[13:23:22] <supsup> how even
[13:24:27] <prodserver> is sprint iphone worth it?
[13:24:31] <raj> johnkpaul, i don't understand how the :contains test is also using .filter
[13:24:42] <prodserver> i mean which is better iphone or andriod or windows phone 7
[13:24:53] <johnkpaul> supsup: "original" then
[13:26:10] <johnkpaul> raj: it's comparing how fast a filter by using the :contains fake-selector is compared to how fast a filter by using the handrolled function to check the string for a value
[13:27:20] <mengu_> hello everyone. i have a problem. http://paste.pocoo.org/show/577151/ this does not set the contestants. why is that? i believe there is a problem with namespacing there.
[13:27:47] <raj> johnkpaul, hate to say it, but I don't understand
[13:28:27] <johnkpaul> you don't have to hate to say it, we all don't understand some things, but what exactly don't you understand
[13:28:45] <raj> why not just compare using :contains to using .filter()
[13:29:18] <johnkpaul> you could
[13:29:23] <johnkpaul> but one is a selector and one is a method, so that would be apples to oranges
[13:29:28] <johnkpaul> they're trying to even it out
[13:29:44] <johnkpaul> oh I see
[13:29:50] <johnkpaul> it's the names of the tests that are confusing
[13:29:58] <johnkpaul> it shouldn't be named :contains vs filter
[13:30:12] <johnkpaul> it should be "filtering by :contains" vs "filtering by handrolled javascript"
[13:30:33] <raj> oh
[13:30:35] <mengu_> and this is the way it works: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/MgBMRCKqOGtXWm4gGn9c/
[13:30:39] <raj> that makes more sense
[13:30:50] <johnkpaul> mengu_: I think it's because your callback happens afterwards
[13:30:55] <johnkpaul> or, if I undersatnd correctly at least
[13:30:55] <raj> thanks
[13:31:02] <johnkpaul> the $.post is asychronous
[13:31:03] <johnkpaul> no problem raj
[13:31:51] <jeffsmykil> anyone have any idea why this wouldn't respect the margin-bottom
[13:31:51] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/A2j9y/12/
[13:32:52] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: I've seen the issue, I don't know off the top of my head how to fix it
[13:32:57] <johnkpaul> but #css would probably be able t help you
[13:33:16] <jeffsmykil> yeah i popped in there too
[13:33:30] <jeffsmykil> at least it's out there and it's not just me
[13:34:07] <jeffsmykil> I worry with it being late on a friday that no one will bother looking
[13:34:08] <johnkpaul> oh, it's position absolute
[13:34:23] <johnkpaul> if it's positioned absolutely, there's nothing to push
[13:34:50] <f0rkn1ght> jeffsmykil,  Need something ?
[13:34:57] <Logikos> if i was doing: $('.ltTabs').each(function(index){  ... });  .. how might it from within that function refer to a child of this isntance of .ltTabs with the class of .someclass ...
[13:35:07] <johnkpaul> also jeffsmykil, the container is overflow hidden
[13:35:07] <jeffsmykil> which # are you looking at johnkpaul
[13:35:10] <johnkpaul> map
[13:35:41] <Logikos> i understand that i can do $(this).css() for example to change css properties for that instance of .ltTabs ... but supose i wanted to change css properties or animate properties of a specific child ?
[13:36:08] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: made it relative like it should be still no diference
[13:36:13] <xp_prg> hi all, I am trying to understand if I can make indented tabs or not
[13:36:33] <supsup> johnkpaul what about using regex for filter function vs indexof?
[13:36:36] <devOlsen> jeffsmykil, what element are we needing a margin to behave?
[13:36:43] <johnkpaul> Logikos: $(this).find(".someclass")
[13:36:53] <johnkpaul> supsup: no idea, make a jsperf and see
[13:37:02] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: it's not just that, there's a few other css issues
[13:37:03] <devOlsen> reviewing #14 btw.
[13:37:04] <jeffsmykil> it needs to push the map either up or down
[13:37:18] <johnkpaul> oh, there's a 14, I was on 12
[13:37:20] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/A2j9y/16/
[13:38:04] <devOlsen> http://jsfiddle.net/A2j9y/20/ ?
[13:38:07] <Logikos> johnkpaul: ty
[13:38:12] <johnkpaul> Logikos: no problem, have fun
[13:38:39] <jeffsmykil> 20 doesnt work
[13:38:42] <jeffsmykil> look at 16
[13:39:04] <supsup> johnkpaul what is difference of yes / no? won't they just be reverse?
[13:39:07] <supsup> always
[13:39:16] <supsup> i.e., yes = !no
[13:39:24] <jeffsmykil> might have an answer
[13:39:27] <johnkpaul> supsup: what are we talking about?
[13:39:33] <supsup> your jsfiddle
[13:39:37] <supsup> sorry ~ just random
[13:40:22] <StephenS> can someone help me
[13:40:25] <StephenS> Im willing to pay HIm
[13:41:33] <xmaddness> When doing a animate for a width, is there a way to swing to center, rather than swinging to the left?
[13:41:44] <xmaddness> erm to a smaller width
[13:41:55] <xmaddness> 100% -> 80%
[13:47:57] <xp_prg> is there a jquery ui irc channel?
[13:48:04] <sam113101> StephenS: pay me
[13:49:05] <yedimind> xmaddness, center the element? use margin: 0 auto;
[13:49:25] <xmaddness> well, if I do margin: auto it snaps instead of animating
[13:50:37] <johnkpaul> supsup: I thnk you meant my jsperf, I didn't make that, I just googled for it
[13:50:44] <johnkpaul> because raj was asking about contains
[13:53:49] <johnkpaul> xmaddness: I think that you might need to animate the position at the same time as the width
[13:53:54] <johnkpaul> to achieve what you'r elooking for
[13:53:58] <xmaddness> yeah I was hoping to avoid that
[13:54:01] <xmaddness> >_<
[13:54:12] <xmaddness> but I think you're correct
[13:54:28] <johnkpaul> yeah, other than margin auto, there's no other option that I know of
[13:54:42] <johnkpaul> I need to head out though, let me know how that goes xmaddness
[13:54:44] <hlveheart> i margin auto all my shit
[13:54:47] <xmaddness> thanks
[13:56:18] <supsup> johnkpaul: why do i have to compare a boolean result for the regexs to get mirror of other jsperf case?  http://jsperf.com/jquery-contains-vs-filter/2
[13:58:55] <prodserver> sup sup what is jspeft?
[13:58:59] <prodserver> jsperf
[13:59:07] <prodserver> does it see how fast ur js is?
[13:59:12] <supsup> yah
[13:59:16] <prodserver> how
[13:59:31] <supsup> using power of comparison
[13:59:47] <prodserver> it runs ur site in different browsers?
[13:59:48] <supsup> runs code blocks 10000 times or something each then compares run time of each block
[14:00:00] <supsup> no u run the tests it just setups the engine
[14:00:15] <prodserver> tahts cool as shit
[14:00:21] <prodserver> what happens if u have an error
[14:00:38] <supsup> go home and go mountain biking prob
[14:01:11] <prodserver> huh
[14:01:19] <prodserver> who?
[14:03:52] <hlveheart> BYE GUYS

[14:20:05] <prodserver> np
[14:20:42] <lolzie> Hi guys, I have cloned a table which has a bunch of input fields inside it.  When I look to put that clone on the page elsewhere, it contains the values typed into the fields by the user.  How can I reset the input values from the clone?
[14:22:55] <raj> does history.js have a way to collect just the query items?
[14:23:09] <raj> even better, to collect them as a JS object?
[14:23:55] <xec> lolzie: you could select all the inputs in the clone and do .val("") ?
[14:23:57] <razzi> lolzie .. $clone.find('input').val('');
[14:28:09] <lolzie> xec & razzi: thanks, that seems to be like what I want
[14:36:26] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all.
[14:37:13] <razzi> what afternoon, it's the middle of the night
[14:43:04] <JavaLover> guys i'm using this guys code & he says "wrapInner" & it wraps the div with new data, is there a way to do the reverse of this?
[14:43:51] <supsup> ? jsfiddle.net
[14:43:55] <bot-t> supsup, #11507 ($(document).ready() does not work with Internet Explorer 8 ... - Opened 2 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11507

[14:46:32] <JavaLover> soo then is there a reverse of wrapinner?
[14:47:23] <JavaLover> oh there is it's called unwrap
[14:47:27] <JavaLover> that's actually really cool btw
[14:47:38] <JavaLover> http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/   <-- freaking awesome code
[14:47:45] <paul_irish> take off your jqueries, lover
[14:48:04] <JavaLover> i'm sorry what paul?
[14:48:38] <paul_irish> just adding something to the conversation
[14:48:41] <paul_irish> to spice it up
[14:49:11] <supsup> paul_irish:  he loves java anyway.  prob greasy grails user
[14:49:20] <prodserver> is jqueries like dinglyberries?

[14:50:30] <sorrymyeng> hi everybody, why my page scrolls after this function? showOrderRules = function() { $("#order_rules").toggle(); return false; } i mean there is "return false" after all...
[14:51:41] <rroelofs> sorrymyeng:  if your toggle changes the dom in a way that makes the page shorter I can see that happening.  can you make a fiddle?
[14:52:24] <rroelofs> ? jsfiddle @ sorrymyeng
[14:52:24] <bot-t> sorrymyeng, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

[14:54:59] <sorrymyeng> rroelofs: there is some mistake in my fiddle usage, but there is it: http://jsfiddle.net/uakLT/
[14:55:03] <paul_irish> i feel like answering a jquery question
[14:56:35] <rroelofs> removing the <script tag will help
[14:57:30] <rroelofs> sorrymyeng: and yes, if you are at the bottom of the page and you click to show terms, I'd expect the page to scroll to keep you at the bottom.
[14:57:48] <rroelofs> gotta run
[14:57:59] <supsup> i doubt he really ran.
[14:58:31] <paul_irish> likely a trot
[14:59:13] <sorrymyeng> rroelofs: as i can remember it shouldnt scroll, whot should i change in my script to prevent scrolling?
[14:59:47] <Whirl3d> Has anyone made a serial animation engine like "Fuse" for jquery?
[15:01:37] <Woet> Whirl3d: what is fuse and what is a "serial animation engine?
[15:02:30] <Whirl3d> sorry, should have provided context. Fuse was an animation engine in Actionscript 2 that let you put together arrays of animations to be handled sequentially

[15:04:33] <supsup> hey paul given the situation:  a) page has iframe<same domain>  b) iframe creates div with id='dialog' and appends it to the parent.  c) dialog.open is called in iframe.... it opens dialog in iframe instead of parent.  (calling window.parent.$('#myDialog')...opens it correctly) but why does it even open the dialog at all on wrong scope since the selector does not existin in the child iframe.
[15:04:47] <sorrymyeng> http://stackoverflow.com/a/2084774 see this. it is told that there is some error in my "huge" script
[15:05:57] <JavaLover> omg it worked!~
[15:06:00] <JavaLover> WOOHOOOO!
[15:06:03] <paul_irish> WOOHOOOOOO
[15:06:17] <JavaLover> that was so frustrating
[15:06:22] <JavaLover> i'm like "how am I gonna do this this guys code is so complex"
[15:06:26] <z0n3d> as soon as i declare var i = new Image().src = "image src"; does the page go out and retrieve that image?
[15:06:28] <JavaLover> and then I just hacked my way around it
[15:06:39] <JavaLover> he used wrapInner() to add stuff to my existing code
[15:06:50] <JavaLover> and then I used unwrap(); to remove what he added & then redid his function
[15:07:01] <paul_irish> z0n3d: ya
[15:07:10] <JavaLover> the problem was i was transferring a div of code to a new div & it screwed up part of the interface
[15:07:13] <JavaLover> but now it's perfectly fine
[15:08:05] <paul_irish> supsup: because SOP says it can still ahve a reference to a dom element outside its window?
[15:08:12] <paul_irish> iunno thats some weird shit.
[15:08:18] <paul_irish> your guess is as good as mien
[15:08:26] <supsup> k
[15:08:30] <supsup> yah was random
[15:09:17] <lolzie> Sorry for silly qs, really quite new to the jquery paradigm (but I love it) - looking thru docs but a little lost on this one; I've filtered down to a set of inputs (let's call that $inputs), how can I find the one with the name "hello" ?
[15:09:20] <sorrymyeng> guys help me please http://jsfiddle.net/uakLT/3/
[15:10:15] <paul_irish> .filter(selector)
[15:10:17] <paul_irish> lolsy
[15:10:29] <supsup> what kind of scrollin u trying to prevent i don't see any in example u made
[15:11:10] <sorrymyeng> supsup: page scrolls to top if put this code in real page
[15:11:17] <supsup> o
[15:11:27] <supsup> lol return false on click
[15:11:33] <supsup> hurm u do
[15:11:51] <supsup> why u doing onclick like that
[15:12:21] <evilgeenius> I need to 1) slideUp a div, then 2) move it somewhere else on the page, then 3) slide it down again.  I know the code do do each of these actions individually, but the timing is wrong and it looks wierd.  Does jquery have a nice way of doing this?
[15:12:31] <sorrymyeng> and how i should do that instead?o_O
[15:12:58] <supsup> add onclick event prob will fix it..sec trying it out
[15:13:58] <supsup> this work? http://jsfiddle.net/uakLT/5/
[15:15:31] <sorrymyeng> supsup: YES! but... why?
[15:16:36] <supsup> hurm good question my answer would just be a guess tho so i'll let someone else answer.
[15:17:05] <supsup> technically ur suppose to use .on now also i think...i'm still back in the dark ages ofr jquery 1.5
[15:17:06] <lolzie> paul_irish: thanks dude
[15:17:08] <catcher> In an ajax call, does the success handler have to be an anonymous function?
[15:17:17] <supsup> catcher no.
[15:17:55] <catcher> supsup, figured - so how I get the data parameter to the function I'm trying to call? The anon function knows what 'data' is, but a normal call does not..
[15:17:55] <supsup> not sure why .on was made to ruin my day i think
[15:18:34] <supsup> i think u just pass data param like u would to anon
[15:18:56] <catcher> supsup but the word 'data' is undefined in a situation like success: myCallBack(data)
[15:19:51] <catcher> I can just call my function from within the success anon function, and pass data that way. Seems like an unnecessary step though.
[15:21:30] <supsup> hurm yah sec i'll try
[15:21:59] <lolzie> paul_irish: dammit, my incompetency at this is getting on my nerves!  $inputs.filter("[name='hello']") <-- should this return all inputs named "hello" from my list of inputs?
[15:22:12] <dabear> catcher: function myhandler(data){}  and then $.ajax(url, { success:myhandler})
[15:22:12] <lolzie> Doesn't seem to be for me :/
[15:22:25] <paul_irish> it should.
[15:22:35] <supsup> yah what dabear said.
[15:23:18] <dabear> lolzie: it should yes, but not those named name="hellofoo"
[15:23:20] <dabear> or others
[15:23:36] <catcher> dabear, money, thanks
[15:23:43] <lolzie> Ya I understand.  This is strange
[15:24:49] <lolzie> OH it's where my input was named as hello[] (I didn't consider [] as part of the name!)
[15:24:53] <Inazad> Hi there, I use jScrollPane for this page (http://www.houdinithelastescape.com/fr/index.php?p=m). I have the same bug on all the pages, the scrollbar doesn't appears... I always have to refresh the page... No errors in the console... Why this happen ?
[15:25:10] <supsup> sorrymyeng:  it appears this answers your question: http://www.mail-archive.com/jquery-en@googlegroups.com/msg71371.html  it's built into jquery where functions don't have this built in feature.
[15:26:08] <dabear> lolzie: yep, that's what I suspected. it's not an array just because the name has brackets :)
[15:30:12] <Inazad> any idea someone ?
[15:42:45] <catcher> I have json data in this format: http://pastebin.com/TSjw0XYi   - how can I parse or each over each ID?
[15:44:14] <shoky> you can parse with $.parseJSON
[15:44:26] <shoky> you can each with $.each
[15:44:43] <catcher> shoky, agreed, but $.each over the $.parseJSON is not working out.
[15:44:52] <shoky> ?demo
[15:44:53] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:46:21] <WebDragon> any FF 11 people here?
[15:46:57] <Vordreller> here
[15:47:06] <Vordreller> if you mean, using it
[15:47:08] <WebDragon> I got a bit of small jquery adding a multiple-background image overlaid on a linear gradient here http://360.client-proof.com/  in the search box at the top there should be a magnifying glass that disappears when you focus the field
[15:47:22] <WebDragon> works here in opera and chrome but my FF 11 isn't displaying the image -- and I haven't a clue why
[15:47:38] <WebDragon> and I know multiple-backgrounds work in FF because the footer uses them
[15:47:58] <WebDragon> firebug turns up nothing wrt errors in the js I'm using
[15:48:18] <Vordreller> according to the firebug Style panel
[15:48:32] <Vordreller> the rule that shows the search.png is overruled by something else
[15:48:38] <Vordreller> it's there but it's slashed
[15:49:24] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/Gq5H3/
[15:49:30] <Vordreller> so in style.css, line 456
[15:50:21] <WebDragon> Vordreller: yes I'm overriding the search.png image in twentyeleven/style.css with the child theme's 360marketing/style.css definitions
[15:50:25] <WebDragon> so that's perfectly normal
[15:50:29] <Vordreller> k
[15:51:08] <WebDragon> the fiddle above has the code I'm using to add the magnifying glass of my own, to overlay the gradient
[15:51:32] <Vordreller> hmmmm
[15:51:55] <WebDragon> the gradient definition's way too complex to do multiple things with. so I use jquery to prepend it instead to whichever of those gradient definitions the browser's accepting
[15:52:29] <WebDragon> I'm using the definitions generated by http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[15:54:02] <Vordreller> I just tried running some jquery commands through the firebug console on that site
[15:54:10] <Vordreller> and I'm getting back nothing but "undefined" and "null"
[15:55:44] <WebDragon> I've got it running in noconflict mode insofar as I'm aware
[15:56:03] <WebDragon> dunno what WP's default setting is but presumably it's in noConflict mode
[15:56:21] <WebDragon> I know jquery works because the slider and a few other things are working
[15:56:38] <Vordreller> Just tried simply running $(document).ready(function() {});
[15:56:46] <Vordreller> And it says "document" is undefined
[15:56:50] <Parhs> hello guys i downloaded jqueryui but this doesnt work. $("#slideshow").stop().animate({             left:  left        },600,"easeInOutCirc");
[15:57:31] <Vordreller> no, it says it's null
[15:57:34] <Vordreller> my bad
[15:57:55] <WebDragon> Vordreller: jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { });
[15:58:03] <Vordreller> same thing
[15:58:14] <Vordreller> tried it too when I saw you had that in your sourcecode
[15:58:17] <Vordreller> not really necessary
[15:58:19] <WebDragon> I'm using that to wrap both my scripts -- so I'm sure it works
[15:58:21] <Vordreller> that extra $ there
[15:58:35] <WebDragon> the extra $ means that internally in the function I can use $ as i would normally
[15:58:48] <WebDragon> at least, this is what I read on the wordpress site
[15:59:39] <Vordreller> huh
[15:59:47] <WebDragon> jQuery(document).ready(function( $ ) { console.log($) });
[15:59:48] <WebDragon> try that
[16:00:02] <Vordreller> my bad in assuming you pasted the same thing i tried back there
[16:00:09] <WebDragon> http://digwp.com/2011/09/using-instead-of-jquery-in-wordpress/ <-- it's briefly mentioned here as a quick ref
[16:00:09] <Vordreller> no longer returning null
[16:03:40] <Vordreller> I think I found the problem
[16:03:41] <Parhs> hello guys i downloaded jqueryui but this doesnt work. $("#slideshow").stop().animate({             left:  left        },600,"easeInOutCirc");  ?
[16:03:44] <Vordreller> Not entirely sure
[16:03:44] <StephenS> how can I do when I add image to the website to show live preview as thumbnail of that image?
[16:04:03] <Vordreller> WebDragon: in 360marketing.js
[16:04:09] <WebDragon> Vordreller: ok
[16:04:20] <Vordreller> try replacing all $ signs inside the braces with jQuery
[16:04:23] <Vordreller> the word jQuery
[16:04:41] <Vordreller> if what you said back there checks out, $ signs are no longer equal to the jQuery variable
[16:04:48] <Vordreller> so you can't use them to signify that anymore
[16:05:07] <Vordreller> so now you have to use the jQuery function instead of its alias, the $ sign
[16:06:40] <systemfault> He could use a closure...
[16:07:04] <systemfault> (function($) {        write all the code with $ here           })(jQuery);
[16:07:05] <WebDragon> it's strange that it works in Opera and Chrome though
[16:07:13] <Vordreller> I don't rightly recall what a closure is
[16:07:55] <Vordreller> doesn't it have something to do with variables remaining accessible in a different scope?
[16:08:19] <WebDragon> http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script#jQuery_noConflict_wrappers -- this is how wordpress recommends using jquery
[16:08:31] <Vordreller> either way, WebDragon, is it working now?
[16:08:43] <Vordreller> I updated that jsfiddle you made: http://jsfiddle.net/Gq5H3/2/
[16:08:49] <WebDragon> If, for some reason, you want your code to execute immediately (instead of waiting for the DOM ready event), then you can use this wrapper method instead: (regarding your mention of closures, systemfault)
[16:09:03] <systemfault> :)
[16:09:08] <WebDragon> Vordreller: reload in firefox and see
[16:09:15] <WebDragon> http://360.client-proof.com/
[16:09:24] <WebDragon> still working fine in opera and chrome here
[16:09:26] <Vordreller> still not getting a magnifier
[16:10:06] <WebDragon> yeah so it's something FF specific then but I'm still not sure it's jquery. I'm gonna move the script back to how it was (too much pain writing jQuery( instead of $( all over the place
[16:10:56] <WebDragon> ok it's back to how it was
[16:11:11] <WebDragon> it might be a firefox bug
[16:11:28] <WebDragon> but weird to see something like that in FF11 -- I'd expect to see it in far earlier versions
[16:11:30] <WebDragon> maybe
[16:11:42] <WebDragon> I forget when FF implemented css3 multiple backgrounds
[16:11:47] <WebDragon> let alone linear-gradients
[16:12:26] <raj> when is _suid used in history.js?
[16:12:26] <catcher> Any reason it's a bad idea to perform an ajax get inside the success handler of another ajax get?
[16:12:35] <raj> seems random that it shows up
[16:13:21] <shoky> rajy
[16:13:36] <raj> shalom
[16:13:36] * WebDragon ponders some more
[16:13:38] <shoky> catcher that's a bad idea?
[16:13:39] <shoky> ;) raj
[16:13:44] <shoky> wassup
[16:13:54] <raj> still tinkering with history.js
[16:14:00] <catcher> shoky, no?
[16:14:25] <shoky> catcher, was there anything that made you think it's a bad idea?
[16:14:35] <catcher> shoky, timing, I suppose..
[16:14:45] <shoky> what does it have to do with timing
[16:14:56] <catcher> shoky, sounds like I've got my answer, ty
[16:15:10] <WebDragon> damn you firefox. what's wrong with you? why are you falling down when even Opera can keep up just fine
[16:15:18] <shoky> anyway i haven't done much ajax but i don't see a reason why it would be a bad idea
[16:15:25] <shoky> depending on what you're doing, of course..
[16:15:55] <shoky> raj what're you using it for? (i dunno it really)
[16:15:57] <catcher> shoky, yeah, I suppose as long as the data isn't required in a specific order, should be fine.
[16:16:23] <shoky> it could still arrive in a specific order..
[16:16:34] <WebDragon> anyone else have any clues why the js that adds the magnifying glass to the background of the search box (and vanishes it when focused) isn't working on Firefox but IS working in chrome/opera here? http://360.client-proof.com/
[16:17:07] <Vordreller> WebDragon: just tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/bhJtn/
[16:17:13] <Vordreller> returns an empty string
[16:17:17] <raj> shoky, for query parameters
[16:17:27] <shoky> hmm?
[16:17:36] <raj> and so back button works
[16:17:40] <raj> with js
[16:17:43] <shoky> ah
[16:18:02] <raj> it uses hash for older browsers
[16:18:04] <shoky> client wants that?
[16:18:19] <raj> i'm the client
[16:18:26] <shoky> ah ;)
[16:18:35] <raj> so yes :)
[16:18:43] <shoky> why depend on a browser button and how it handles history
[16:18:55] <shoky> instead of making your own buttons/links to wherever you want
[16:18:57] <shoky> in your app
[16:21:14] <raj> shoky, cuz I hate when apps do that
[16:21:47] <shoky> you probably hate when bad apps do it badly ;p
[16:21:59] <raj> i ESPECIALLY loath that
[16:22:00] <mehale> is this syntax ok? $('table#cluster tbody tr#s' + spots.items.pop() + ' td').remove(); // The row wont be removed
[16:22:10] <shoky> raj oks ;)
[16:22:33] <raj> anyway, i have no idea why this _suid is showing up
[16:22:46] <shoky> mehale, syntax seems fine
[16:22:56] <mehale> wtf happens then?? omg!
[16:23:03] <shoky> hm?
[16:23:28] <shoky> raj fiddle smth and i'll work on it with ya ;p
[16:23:54] <shoky> it is passover night
[16:24:00] <shoky> and everything is very closed
[16:24:07] <shoky> <bored
[16:25:36] <WebDragon> Vordreller: http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/wkSBX/
[16:25:43] <WebDragon> works in jsfiddle here. does this work in FF ?
[16:26:11] <Vordreller> no
[16:26:14] <raj> oh snap, I didn't even realize it's passover
[16:26:17] <Vordreller> the Result bar says: "{"error": "Please use POST request"}"
[16:26:21] <raj> no wonder half the town is closed
[16:26:33] <shoky> heh
[16:26:34] <raj> oh, it's good friday too
[16:26:57] <WebDragon> Vordreller: whoops
[16:27:17] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/wkSBX/2/ try this Vordreller
[16:27:27] <WebDragon> this also has the focus/blur bit to hide the magnifier
[16:28:12] <Vordreller> no, no magnifier showing
[16:28:27] <Vordreller> thought the textfield doesn't start at the utmost left of the searchfield
[16:28:47] <Vordreller> though*
[16:29:22] <Vordreller> lol, that "tel" ting I put in there was just some random name I had to come up with for a variable :p
[16:30:39] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/wkSBX/3/  whoops had my padding reversed
[16:30:48] <WebDragon> heh yeah that's ok it still works
[16:30:56] <WebDragon> and the fiddle works in opera and FF here
[16:31:01] <WebDragon> err chrome.
[16:31:02] <WebDragon> not ff
[16:31:11] * WebDragon headdesks at his typo
[16:31:28] <Vordreller> btw
[16:31:34] <Vordreller> searchbox.css({"background":tel});
[16:31:37] <Vordreller> why the curly braces?
[16:31:58] <systemfault> Because he can :/
[16:32:07] <Vordreller> looking at the .css method documentation, I don't see where it accepts JSON as a parameter
[16:32:19] <systemfault> Vordreller: That's no JSON.
[16:32:20] <Vordreller> oh wait it's a ma
[16:32:22] <Vordreller> map
[16:32:27] <systemfault> Vordreller: It's a object literal.
[16:32:31] <WebDragon> weird
[16:32:41] <WebDragon> I also notice in FF the background doesn't get RESET back either
[16:32:46] <WebDragon> when you unfocus
[16:32:56] <systemfault> Vordreller: The idea is that by passing a object, you can change multiple properties in a single .css call
[16:33:14] <WebDragon> Vordreller: WRT the curly braces I got in the habit of that since I am used to typing "background-color" vs backgroundColor with the StudlyCaps
[16:33:28] <Vordreller> :p
[16:33:40] <WebDragon> and what systemfault said about passing multiple values
[16:33:48] <WebDragon> I tend to do that a bit too
[16:34:01] <WebDragon> (mostly while testing stuff)
[16:34:20] <Vordreller> hey WebDragon
[16:34:28] <Vordreller> this works: http://jsfiddle.net/wkSBX/4/
[16:35:02] <Vordreller> however, it does not come back when I click outside again
[16:35:09] <WebDragon> hrm that's odd
[16:35:17] <Vordreller> oh that's my fault
[16:35:21] <WebDragon> i put an alert in each of the focus/blur functions
[16:35:25] <Vordreller> I changed the blur function to "unfocus"
[16:35:32] <WebDragon> and the blur alert comes up before the focus one does
[16:35:35] <Vordreller> blur works
[16:36:20] <Vordreller> So what I did was remove the "+ searchbox.css("background");" part
[16:36:27] <Vordreller> and then it suddenly worked
[16:37:44] <Vordreller> yeah, that searchbox.css("background") is returning an empty string
[16:37:55] <Vordreller> So in the var tel = ...
[16:38:01] <Vordreller> you're left at the end with a comma
[16:38:31] <Vordreller> And that's not exactly a valid line of css, methinks
[16:39:16] <WebDragon> Vordreller: it only worked because you overwrite the background
[16:39:18] <WebDragon> hold on
[16:42:28] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/wkSBX/9/ has the gradient background
[16:42:38] <raj> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/jTqNc/2/?something=asdf;test;xyz&somethingelse=hello;bye
[16:42:43] <WebDragon> and why is .css("background") returning blank ?
[16:42:52] <Vordreller> WebDragon: magnifier ain't showing again
[16:42:57] <WebDragon> yeah
[16:43:00] <Vordreller> probably not set previously
[16:43:01] <raj> not sure why getState() isn't working though
[16:43:08] <raj> i've added history.js to the Resources
[16:43:11] <WebDragon> Vordreller: no it's clearly set in the css
[16:43:21] <WebDragon> VERY clearly
[16:43:33] <WebDragon> even in the earliest examples I'd just used background: white;
[16:44:30] <WebDragon> so the real question is, is this a jquery bug or a firefox big
[16:44:32] <WebDragon> bug*
[16:44:39] <Vordreller> http://jsfiddle.net/wkSBX/10/
[16:44:43] <Vordreller> added a console.log
[16:44:52] <Vordreller> shows up in the firebug console
[16:44:55] <Vordreller> still says empty string
[16:45:44] <Vordreller> odd thing is, other stuff is working
[16:45:48] <Vordreller> like asking for the color
[16:45:53] <Vordreller> returns rgb(255, 255, 255)
[16:46:13] <Vordreller> which is white
[16:46:21] <WebDragon> yup
[16:47:00] <Vordreller> say
[16:47:06] <Vordreller> I'm looking at this css tab
[16:47:16] <Vordreller> and I notice you're overwriting the value on every line
[16:47:35] <Vordreller> or am I seeing that wrong
[16:48:20] <Vordreller> css is interpreted top to bottom
[16:48:40] <Vordreller> so if you give background a value on line 1, and the some more on line 2, far as I know it'll  be overwritten not added
[16:49:02] <WebDragon> Vordreller: ere's a weird one http://jsfiddle.net/wkSBX/11/
[16:49:09] <WebDragon> it finds the gradient
[16:49:15] <WebDragon> but then on blur it goes away again
[16:49:26] <WebDragon> it doesn't restore it
[16:50:05] <WebDragon> Vordreller: that gradient definition provides a pile of fallback for each individual browser implementation that DOESN'T speak css linear-gradient()
[16:50:14] <raj> shoky, sorry, used the wrong history.js
[16:50:15] <ejfox> I'm testing a page out, and there seems to be a request my page is making that makes the javascript take a longggggg time to load- how do I find out what request it is? Like, most of the page will load, but this last extra bit takes like 20 seconds and holds the rest of my javascript up. This is the page I'm talking about: http://ejfox.com/Spring2012EJFox.com/
[16:50:17] <raj> this one works better http://jsfiddle.net/jTqNc/3/?something=asdf;test;xyz&somethingelse=hello;bye
[16:50:23] <WebDragon> so that's all perfectly normal. the browser picks the one it understands and ignores the rest
[16:50:38] <WebDragon> Vordreller: but if you delete ALL that and just put background: white; the problem still persists
[16:51:21] <WebDragon> the reason for the comma in the css added by jquery is to make it a compound background by adding the magnifier to overlay over the gradient
[16:51:34] <Vordreller> odd
[16:51:38] <WebDragon> works perfectly in opera/crome
[16:51:40] <WebDragon> chrome*
[16:51:52] <Vordreller> well, I think we have ourselves a bug in either firefox or firebug
[16:52:17] <Vordreller> can't be a jquery error since it's working in other browsers with the same code
[16:53:17] <WebDragon> AND chrome lists BOTH background images in the 2nd console.log -- the magnifier AND the gradient
[16:53:51] <WebDragon> Vordreller: on the other hand $(this).css("background") should just work in firefox
[16:54:20] <WebDragon> I'm pretty sure it has worked, for a while.
[16:54:31] <WebDragon> SOMEONE would have noticed by now if it hadn't
[16:54:37] <Vordreller> I wonder where to go first to report this issue
[16:54:38] <WebDragon> xD
[16:54:40] <WebDragon> me too
[16:54:46] <WebDragon> ajpiano: you around?
[16:56:14] <Vordreller> anyways, I came here with a question of my own that I haven't asked yet
[16:56:20] <ejfox> (I'ma try once more, apologies) I'm testing a page out, and there seems to be a request my page is making that makes the javascript take a longggggg time to load- how do I find out what request it is? Like, most of the page will load, but this last extra bit takes like 20 seconds and holds the rest of my javascript up. This is the page I'm talking about: http://ejfox.com/Spring2012EJFox.com/
[16:57:11] <Vordreller> I'm planning on writing an RSS reader with mainly jQuery and my instructors want me to make a document listing what I'll be researching, what my milestones will be and how long it'll all take
[16:57:43] <windsurf_> I'm chaining an element effect with a 250 ms duration with a callback that then hides the element again, in 250ms. The callback of that triggers an event but I'm finding the callbacks happen right away while the effects are still going. So, visually the effects are delayed how I want but the callbacks are triggering my event prematurely. Not sure what I'm missing
[16:57:46] <Vordreller> So I sent in a document and apparently there's not enough info in there
[16:58:21] <Vordreller> So I'm wondering what I'm gonna have to be using/researching and what a good amount of time for researching all these things would be
[16:58:34] <Vordreller> for the life of me, I'm so bad at saying "this'll cost me x hours to implement"
[16:58:48] <WebDragon> I'll save this fiddle for later perusal by folks
[16:59:12] <Vordreller> WebDragon: I'll make a post on the jquery forums, asking for advise on where to report this
[16:59:17] <Vordreller> step 1: to make an account :p
[16:59:32] <shoky> raj i'll take a look in a bit
[16:59:38] <windsurf_> Vordreller: the secret is to break it down into small pieces that are easy to attach time to (1 hr here, 2 hrs there). Then add it up
[16:59:55] <Vordreller> myeah, but I think I'm being a bit too general
[16:59:55] <windsurf_> Vordreller: and depending on risk add 50%-100% of your estimate
[17:00:14] <Vordreller> right now I've got "research jquery XML reader" and "research jquery UI3
[17:00:16] <Vordreller> "
[17:00:19] <windsurf_> are callbacks supposed to wait for animation to complete (i.e. hide animation)
[17:00:21] <Vordreller> "juery ui"
[17:00:46] <Vordreller> windsurf_: far as I know, yes
[17:00:47] <windsurf_> yeah so Vordreller  make that a header and break what that entails into smaller pieces.
[17:01:04] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/WebDragon/wkSBX/  new base fiddle
[17:01:04] <windsurf_> Vordreller: the website will have a list of widgets and effects etc . estimate out each of those that you'll be researching
[17:01:17] <WebDragon> Vordreller: use that fiddle I just pasted for reference
[17:01:24] <Vordreller> WebDragon: I will
[17:01:37] <WebDragon> Vordreller: I was just going to ask ajpiano in the morning when I get up
[17:02:19] <WebDragon> Vordreller: if you do paste to the forums about it, leave me a note with the url to the forum post on MemoServ here at freenode
[17:02:28] <WebDragon> /msg memoserv help for details
[17:02:33] <Vordreller> will do
[17:02:41] <Vordreller> been a while since I actually used a memoserv service :p
[17:02:46] <WebDragon> heh
[17:02:58] <WebDragon> it's convenient when you know the denizens are regulars on freenode
[18:00:10] <abjorn> coldhead: Is driving a Fiat 500 a hipster stereotype? Because it should be.
[18:03:20] <JoeyA> Does jQuery have a built-in function for creating a DocumentFragment?  Or should I just $(document.createDocumentFragment()) ?
[18:16:32] <shoky> raj
[18:16:41] <shoky> why do you say it's not working?
[18:35:42] <Logikos> can someone tell me why this is showing an error in consel saying rotate() is not defined

[20:38:29] <hhihihihihih> if you go to jquery.com
[20:38:39] <hhihihihihih> you will see run code
[20:38:52] <vladikoff> hhihihihihih, http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[20:39:05] <smplstk> um, the code that gets run by that is directly above it?

[20:42:23] <shoky> HELLOW
[20:42:29] <hhihihihihih> thing* where it shows you the page your on but when you click on the number it shows you the available page
[20:42:31] <hhihihihihih> pages*
[20:42:55] <Logikos> how can jquery know how many child elements there are in a specific element ?

[21:02:14] <vicatcu> I'm getting a "SyntaxError: invalid label" error on my ajax response - which is returning JSON that Firebug seems to have no trouble parsing...
[21:02:20] <f0rkn1ght> hhihihihihih,  More than needed :)
[21:02:26] <hhihihihihih> nws
[21:02:41] <hhihihihihih> so how do you change your nickname here?
[21:02:53] <vicatcu> how might I go about determining the cause of the error?
[21:03:04] <bishopz> hhihihihihih, i'm happy to help, but i think i could write it from scratch faster than modifying their code, imo
[21:03:05] <vicatcu> hhihihihih: try /nick newnickname
[21:03:33] <hhihihihihih> vicatcu http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3672672/json-data-returns-invalid-label-error
[21:03:50] <bishopz> letmegooglethatforyou hehe
[21:03:58] <hhihihihihih> exactly
[21:04:29] <hhihihihihih> ok so i still dont know how to change my name
[21:04:58] <hhihihihihih> ?
[21:05:22] <hhihihihihih> i think i coloured my name
[21:05:23] <hhihihihihih> no
[21:05:26] <hhihihihihih> :(
[21:05:29] <katya^> does anyone know if there's a plupload channel somewhere?
[21:05:37] <bishopz> this is my github repo yall, first one i've published, let me know if anyone has feedback. I want people to use it. https://github.com/bishopZ/Frame.js
[21:05:42] <vicatcu> hhihihihihihih: my response text is here https://gist.github.com/2324957
[21:05:49] <vicatcu> the key is quoted...
[21:06:24] <hhihihihihih> i dont know that much about ajax
[21:06:55] <hhihihihihih> 7/10 html 7/10 jquery 7/10 javascript ;P
[21:07:13] <bishopz> try just getting the responseText as text and calling JSON.parse on it
[21:07:25] <bishopz> might give you a better error message
[21:07:34] <hhihihihihih> ok ima re join and change my name
[21:07:40] <hhihihihihih> its going to be killallz
[21:07:47] <bishopz> hehe
[21:08:07] <vicatcu> bishopz, the problem is my ajax success handler doesn't get called, it jumps to my failure handler
[21:09:10] <bishopz> are you calling $.ajax or $.getJSON? if $.ajax, what is the content-type specified as? json?
[21:09:37] <vicatcu> $.ajax
[21:09:48] <vicatcu> hang on
[21:11:35] <vicatcu> here is my javascript https://gist.github.com/7965c6e433eef476355f
[21:12:46] <bishopz> ha, async: true, interesting
[21:12:55] <vicatcu> and the response content-type =  text/javascript
[21:13:05] <vicatcu> yea i know that's the default right?
[21:13:28] <killallz> yo
[21:13:31] <vicatcu> anyway... you see anything wrong?
[21:13:38] <killallz> its hihihihihi
[21:13:51] <killallz> nah man i dont know any ajax
[21:13:57] <bishopz> try dataType = 'text'
[21:14:49] <bishopz> it's likely failing because jQuery's trying to auto parse it into json
[21:15:33] <vicatcu> bah! i made dataType: "text json"
[21:15:37] <vicatcu> that seems to make it happy
[21:16:03] <bishopz> unfortunately, the "intelligent guess" jquery does on ajax can't account for all the little strange-ness-esthat happen in http
[21:16:13] <research4oscar> I am trying to figure out how to use ajax in my website.  Should I be messing with learning ajax or pick up a book on jquery. I guess what I am asking is if I am wasting my time in trying to understand ajax first?
[21:16:21] <vicatcu>  ya
[21:16:26] <vicatcu> thanks for the help!
[21:16:38] <bishopz> anytime
[21:17:16] <killallz> reaserchforoscar http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax.asp
[21:17:52] <bishopz> yeah, jquery is the best way to do ajax, imo. i love the motto "write less, do more"
[21:17:58] <killallz> EVERYONE CAN I GET SOME <3
[21:18:08] <vladikoff> killallz, please do not link to w3schools
[21:18:16] <bishopz> hehe
[21:18:18] <killallz> sorry didnt know
[21:18:53] <vladikoff> killallz, it's better if devs use the official docs or MDN :)
[21:19:12] <bishopz> killallz, have you started on the css? can you gist it?
[21:19:28] <killallz> what css
[21:19:29] <killallz> ?
[21:19:36] <bishopz> here's the thing with the slideshow
[21:19:42] <bishopz> i just dont like how it moves
[21:19:45] <killallz> oh nah
[21:19:53] <research4oscar> hey guys trying to understand - what's wrong with linking to w3schools?
[21:19:58] <killallz> there were 2 slide shows 1 verticle one horizontal
[21:20:12] <killallz> he didnt know abbout the hrizontal
[21:20:56] <vladikoff> research4oscar, http://w3fools.com/
[21:21:40] <killallz> wait did you want it aswell
[21:21:43] <killallz> ?
[21:22:22] <research4oscar> @vladikoff: still not sure I understand why its not a good idea to link w3schools excplicitly.
[21:22:28] <bishopz> so the steps would be to (1) fix the CSS, (2) fix the javascript
[21:22:51] <research4oscar> ah> w3fools is a real website. got it.
[21:23:46] <bishopz> fixing the CSS is pretty easy, .sc_menu a { float:left, margin-left:5px; }
[21:23:52] <bishopz> fix the height and width
[21:24:33] <killallz> bishopz
[21:25:01] <killallz> did you want me to do it  or are you helping me do it
[21:25:33] <bishopz> maybe i dont know what you mean by help
[21:25:49] <killallz> i answered his problem
[21:26:11] <killallz> there was a link on how to do a horizontal slider
[21:26:17] <killallz> he seemed happy
[21:26:33] <bishopz> oh
[21:26:39] <killallz> :P
[21:26:43] <bishopz> i see, my bad

[21:27:04] <killallz> ?
[21:27:27] <infid> where can i find a list of all the event names you can pass to .on()?
[21:28:00] <wookiehangover> infid: you can pass anything into on()
[21:28:06] <killallz> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:28:08] <bishopz> any feedback on my github? https://github.com/bishopZ/Frame.js
[21:28:19] <wookiehangover> do you mean you'd like to learn about browser events vs custom events?
[21:28:29] <bishopz> hehe
[21:28:43] <research4oscar> wow! i just read on w3fools and i gotta tell you its the first time i ever heard of this. to think i was considering paying for one of their certificates. yikes!
[21:28:49] <wookiehangover> infid: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event
[21:29:12] <killallz> whats github
[21:29:35] <killallz> oh
[21:29:44] <bishopz> http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/index.html
[21:30:08] <killallz> brb gotta work
[21:30:24] <wookiehangover> bishopz: look into writing some unit tests with qunit
[21:31:29] <tman-> any less users here?
[21:31:37] <bishopz> good idea, thanks!
[21:32:05] <tman-> i'm new to it but am trying to pass a returned value from a js function to a variable within my .less file
[21:32:25] <tman-> such that the width of the selector will change relative to the returned value
[21:32:38] <tman-> i suppose i could just keep it all in js.. but i wantd to know if this is possible.
[21:32:45] <mangoskittle> I believe you can just make it equal to it
[21:33:05] <tman-> @windowWidth: `document.body.clientWidth`;
[21:33:05] <mangoskittle> sorry I just joined and stepped in on that :-p
[21:33:06] <mangoskittle> nevermind
[21:33:12] <tman-> that gives a number
[21:33:16] <tman-> but doesn't add the px
[21:33:20] <tman-> when i do :
[21:33:37] <tman-> width:@windowWidthpx; it puts a space in the generated css
[21:33:41] <tman-> which is invalid
[21:33:50] <tman-> ie, width:330 px;
[21:33:57] <tman-> is there a workaround?
[21:34:04] <killallz> anyone know anything sexy i could add onto my page
[21:34:05] <mangoskittle> uh
[21:34:24] <killallz> not porn
[21:34:27] <killallz> :P
[21:34:34] <killallz> anything that looks cool
[21:34:57] <bishopz> js1k has tons of cool demos
[21:35:07] <tman-> http://dpaste.com/728042/
[21:35:10] <tman-> mangoskittle
[21:35:19] <mangoskittle> so the space is coming from windowWidth?
[21:35:29] <tman-> yea
[21:35:53] <tman-> i need to trim the space out of the result but i don;t know how
[21:35:56] * tman- grumbles
[21:36:19] <killallz> bishop i knew  i liked you
[21:36:23] <mangoskittle> okay but as it it outputs without the space
[21:36:29] <mangoskittle> it is*
[21:36:37] <tman-> if i don't add px
[21:36:40] <tman-> it just dumps a number
[21:36:43] <mindpwned> .animate
[21:36:44] <tman-> which again is incorrect.
[21:36:48] <mindpwned> css sizing
[21:36:50] <mangoskittle> and you're adding the px in the #container line?
[21:36:55] <tman-> here:
[21:37:11] <mindpwned> css sizing is the coolest thing that nobody gets atm
[21:37:23] <mindpwned> css sizing i
[21:37:27] <killallz> ok guys im out

[21:37:45] <mindpwned> css sizing
[21:38:03] <mindpwned> im telling you what to thing
[21:38:04] <mindpwned> k
[21:38:40] <mangoskittle> are you able to add the px to line 1 instead?
[21:38:46] <mangoskittle> PS: I have never done this before lol
[21:39:20] <tman-> if i do that i get:
[21:39:50] <tman-> http://dpaste.com/728044/
[21:40:05] <tman-> yet another invalid version.
[21:41:50] <tman-> hmm weidth
[21:41:57] <tman-> weird i think it's working
[21:42:37] <tman-> weird, firebug needs an update
[21:42:41] <tman-> it's not showing the correct results...
[21:42:57] <tman-> i added a height value to the div and it's working just fine
[21:42:58] <tman-> COOL!
[21:43:02] <mangoskittle> well it looks like you're supposed to have it on the width: bit, and you just add +"px"
[21:43:14] <tman-> yea it was working
[21:43:20] <tman-> i was confused because FB was failing
[21:43:21] <mangoskittle> vOv
[21:43:34] <tman-> and i didn't have a height on the div so the red bg wasnt' shoing up on an empty div.
[21:43:36] <mangoskittle> I forgot why I came here now
[21:43:55] <mangoskittle> oh right
[21:43:57] <jovrtn> and now you'll never leave
[21:44:00] <jovrtn> trapped forever
[21:44:05] <mangoskittle> oh jebus...
[21:45:42] <research4oscar> okay so i spent a little bit of time reading up on jquery vs ajax. giving that i only have a few hours a week and am a slow learning, the best use of my time is jquery.
[21:46:06] <research4oscar> now, can anyone suggest some good resources to learning jquery?
[21:48:03] <mangoskittle> jquery vs ajax?
[21:49:44] <research4oscar> mangoskittle: my initial question was whether my time would be better spend learning jquery or ajax.
[21:50:23] <research4oscar> that is what i meant. as i understand jquery is used for client side interaction and itself makes use of ajax.
[21:51:17] <mangoskittle> I'm confused by your questions because they aren't really comparable
[21:51:23] <jovrtn> ajax is more like a protocol
[21:51:36] <bishopz> "Learning jQuery" by PACKT Press was helpful to me
[21:51:48] <jovrtn> jquery makes it easy to use it without needing to necessarily understand how it works entirely
[21:51:53] <jovrtn> which can be good or bad :P
[21:51:58] <mangoskittle> Everything I leared was googling and using the jquery site
[21:52:00] <bishopz> he means is jQuery the best framework
[21:52:24] <bishopz> @research no one these days does ajax without a framework
[21:52:27] <mangoskittle> and just writing and learning as I go, in the most non-elitist sense of that since its hard to learn fo rme unless I have real life problems
[21:53:10] <bishopz> there are a lot of good tutorials online
[21:54:46] <mangoskittle> can someone look at this for me, and tell me if my question makes a singleounce of sense
[21:54:55] <mangoskittle> trying to work with someone elses animal:  http://jsfiddle.net/zayne/1/
[21:55:25] <infid> all jquery is is dom handling made easy. If you're doing any javascript on the web not using jquery wouldn't make much sense
[21:56:14] <infid> but jquery can't do everything that javascript can do in the browser so you always need a hybrid approach
[21:56:31] <bishopz> var settings = $.extend( true {
[21:56:36] <bishopz> var settings = $.extend( true, {
[22:01:47] <mangoskittle> ?
[22:02:13] <mangoskittle> if I use icon: settings.singleIcon.category1 it gives me exactly what I need
[22:02:52] <mangoskittle> But I can't specify there what category I will use, I need it to be variable
[22:03:12] <mangoskittle> icon: settings.singleIcon."whatevermycategoryis:
[22:03:52] <bishopz> i see
[22:03:58] <bishopz> two ways to solve it
[22:04:05] <bishopz> the easy way and the right way
[22:04:14] <mangoskittle> win-win...
[22:04:57] <bishopz> would this work? settings.singleIcon[settings.category]
[22:05:41] <bishopz> the easy way would be like
[22:06:26] <bishopz> icon: settings.singleIcon + settings.category + '.png' and naming all the images
[22:07:16] <bishopz> i'm not providing much detail there, let me know if i'm confusing you
[22:07:26] <mangoskittle> what is settings.category
[22:07:45] <bishopz> yeah, maybe i'm confused, where is the category set?
[22:08:02] <mangoskittle> This is for google maps
[22:08:03] <mangoskittle> so...
[22:08:10] <mangoskittle> hwo do I explain this...
[22:08:16] <mangoskittle> We have a ton of locations
[22:08:25] <mangoskittle> and the locations all have a category attribute
[22:08:25] <bishopz> what variable contains the category?
[22:08:34] <mangoskittle> its all in an xml file
[22:08:47] <bishopz> then get it out of the xml and put it into a variable
[22:08:50] <mangoskittle> and in the js we read the xml and stuff all the points into an array which we use various parts of it whenever we need
[22:09:14] <mangoskittle> so in this case, when I call to markermakingthingy
[22:09:22] <mangoskittle> I will tell it the specific locations category
[22:09:47] <mangoskittle> which I then need the markermakingthingy to understand to use that category to find that specific setting, and find the image needed to go with that category
[22:10:03] <research4oscar> can anyone recommend a good tool when working with jquery. for example I use firebug for webdev.
[22:10:31] <bishopz> how do you "tell it the specific locations category"
[22:11:24] <mangoskittle> say in the xml every location has several attributes... like..... name, address, category
[22:11:41] <bishopz> are they stored in a varaible?
[22:11:46] <bishopz> variable
[22:11:57] <mangoskittle> all points are read from the xml and put into an array
[22:12:01] <mangoskittle> its a monster of an array
[22:12:15] <mangoskittle> but it would be something like item[20].category
[22:12:19] <mangoskittle> or something like that
[22:12:22] <bishopz> okay!
[22:12:25] <mangoskittle> and you get the category for that location
[22:12:35] <mangoskittle> I need to use that
[22:12:44] <bishopz> then settings.singleIcon[item[20].category]
[22:12:51] <dlam> is there a way to differentiate between an actual click, and one I did via $('...').click();  ?
[22:13:50] <mangoskittle> omg hold on...
[22:14:05] <infid> where can i find a list of all the event names you can pass to .on()?
[22:14:32] <infid> the actual definitive list, not a list of event names that are specific to javascript and aren't used by .on
[22:14:55] <Whirl3d> Hey all, is there an easy way to extend one object with another without increasing the number/variety of attributes. In other words, is there a builtin function that will "fill & replace" the attrbutes of one object with those of another?
[22:15:38] <Whirl3d> $.extend combines the two and creates problems if the second object has more properties that the first
[22:17:12] <bishopz> W3d, i think you will have to write that
[22:18:02] <Whirl3d> Easy enough. Thanks for the reply. Just didn't want to reinvent the wheel like I did before I knew about extend. LOL
[22:18:27] <bishopz> hehe, i did too ;-)
[22:19:27] <bishopz> are there js functions that aren't used by .on()
[22:19:28] <bishopz> ?
[22:19:36] <bishopz> events
[22:21:33] <infid> bishopz: propertychange maybe
[22:23:18] <bishopz> maybe, my guess is that if the browser registers the event, then jquery responds to it
[22:29:50] <infid> you'd think, but i've never seen the nonstandard propertychange event work in .on() in IE where it should
[22:31:37] <infid> "The bind() method uses feature detection to decide how to attach an event to an element. First it checks for "addEventListener" (DOM Events) and then "attachEvent" (IE specific implementation). IE 9 supports both "addEventListener" and "attachEvent" but IE 8 and bellow only support attachEvent"
[22:39:13] <mangoskittle> bishopz, how do I do singleIcon          : {category1:'/images/map/pins/pin-specific-1.png',category-name:'/images/map/pins/pin-specific-2.png'}   and deal with the "-"
[22:39:16] <mangoskittle> is it possible?
[22:52:45] <klawd> hi!
[22:52:53] <klawd> how do i hide by a slide to the right?
[22:53:21] <klawd> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide#overview found this but it's throwing exceptions
[22:57:52] <raj> I'm using $.post() and for some reason, all the keys have [] at the end of them
[22:57:55] <raj> wsup with that?
[22:58:29] <raj> I'm posting an object
[23:22:24] <RA3OR> hi, im using jquery to filter which contents is shown by class, how do i make this: $('a[href=#index]').click(function(){ /* reset to index as if i just loaded site */ });
[23:27:39] <RA3OR> anyone?
[23:27:52] <jrockjiggz> i don't think i understand your question
[23:28:28] <RA3OR> i want a button that  resets the site's content, as if i would've retyped the thefault site url
[23:28:54] <jrockjiggz> $('el'
[23:28:59] <jrockjiggz> $('el').trigger('click')
[23:29:14] <RA3OR> $('a[href=#index]').click(function(){...
[23:29:21] <RA3OR> ?
[23:29:28] <RA3OR> will try
[23:30:27] <RA3OR> nope
[23:31:30] <mangoskittle> uh
[23:31:35] <mangoskittle> why not jus tlink to itself
[23:32:09] <raj> $.post is expecting an array or a string for its data?
[23:32:22] <jrockjiggz> works here: http://jsfiddle.net/BaNCL/
[23:33:11] <jrockjiggz> dataTypeThe type of data expected from the server. Default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, text, html).
[23:33:34] <RA3OR> jrockjiggz: i dont know what to put INSIDE to make it go to 'index'
[23:33:45] <jrockjiggz> what do you mean 'go to' ?
[23:33:50] <jrockjiggz> change the href value?
[23:33:55] <raj> jrockjiggz, ?
[23:33:57] <RA3OR> well, im loading contents by filters
[23:34:08] <raj> i mean, docs say it expects a map or a string
[23:34:30] <jrockjiggz> raj: not sure, try serialize
[23:34:49] <jrockjiggz> you can serialize your array to sent as data
[23:35:04] <RA3OR> http://privatepaste.com/98f5308f9d
[23:35:18] <raj> jrockjiggz, I'm actually trying to send an object
[23:35:26] <raj> it's formated correctly for JSON in fact
[23:36:12] <raj> I did JSON.stringify(mydata) ... but for some reason, that sends {"myobj":["with","all","its","stuff"]}: with that colon at the end?
[23:36:16] <raj> wth is up with that colon?
[23:36:21] <raj> where did it come from?
[23:37:19] <RA3OR> jrockjiggz: pm? ill provide site link
[23:38:13] <jrockjiggz> RA3OR: $container.isotope({ $(a[href=#index]') }); ?
[23:39:11] <raj> jrockjiggz, any idea?
[23:43:16] <raj> also, why does it say I can only send a map or a string here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ but in their example, they are sending an object
[23:44:34] <Morteza_ipo> hi
[23:44:51] <Morteza_ipo> how to append to select tag if that option is not repeated?
[23:49:39] <raj> Morteza_ipo, more details
[23:50:36] <Morteza_ipo> raj:  I have a select tag that have users list
[23:51:00] <Morteza_ipo> and in other panel I have a select , that is users selected
[23:51:14] <Morteza_ipo> but user can select duplicated users
[23:51:20] <Morteza_ipo> I dont want that
[23:51:45] <raj> i'm not really following
[23:51:50] <raj> can you put a sample in jsfiddle?
[23:52:01] <Morteza_ipo> yes
[23:52:05] <Morteza_ipo> wait
[23:54:06] <Morteza_ipo> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/e6Gcu/1/
[23:54:29] <Morteza_ipo> but some part is php , that site can't support
[23:56:21] <raj> well, it doesn't seem to function
[23:56:45] <raj> so, generally, you need to check the .val() of the select item
[23:56:50] <raj> and then remove that option from whatever box you want
[23:57:00] <Morteza_ipo> how?
[23:57:09] <Morteza_ipo> if($('select[name=ready]').find('option').val(me.val()).val())?
[23:57:34] <raj> .remove()
[23:58:03] <raj> no, check the val() of the select
[23:58:25] <Morteza_ipo> need .each?
