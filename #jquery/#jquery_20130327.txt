[00:09:07] <agu10^> I want to trim a string from all whitespace on the left and right, including tabs and newlines. But I want to KEEP the left and right trimmed strings in 2 other variables. Any ideas?

[00:11:54] <aaron1245> With jQuery mobile, can a panel be universal?  The documentation says to put it in a page, however it's sort of counter-intuitive as a panel is typically a navigation item on multiple pages.
[00:43:40] <nits2312> Hey anyone up for jquery ajax related chat???
[01:20:15] <RSDRSDRSD> what is the best method to embed flash?
[01:20:26] <RSDRSDRSD> there is a plugn swfobject
[01:20:30] <RSDRSDRSD> but isn that outdated?
[01:20:41] <titii> Hi friend, how to appedTo - $(this).appendTo('.drop-place .selected-users') - but before span element?
[01:20:53] <titii> Thanx
[01:27:31] <agu10^> How do I fake an accept-language that's different than mine in my browser?
[01:28:08] <Cork> titii: $('.drop-place .selected-users span').first().before(this);
[01:30:46] <RSDRSDRSD> can´t find a method to embed flash or swf objects
[01:31:37] <Cork> RSDRSDRSD: swfobject is used to create the embed/object tag needed on the page
[01:31:42] <Cork> RSDRSDRSD: if you don't want to use it you can just create it manually
[01:32:04] <RSDRSDRSD> isn´t there a native method in jquery?
[01:32:13] <RSDRSDRSD> or a plugin
[01:32:21] <RSDRSDRSD> the one I found seems outdated
[01:32:32] <seutje> swf is outdated
[01:33:32] <RSDRSDRSD> also for playing video in retarded browsers?
[01:34:16] <seutje> http://jquery.thewikies.com/swfobject/examples still seems to work
[01:34:37] <seutje> prolly not maintained anymore
[01:34:51] <Cork> RSDRSDRSD: as long as you have two codecs options there really isn't many browsers that fails
[01:35:15] <RSDRSDRSD> with the video tah you mean?
[01:35:17] <Cork> (ie9< is the only fairly modern one that would fall into that category)
[01:35:20] <RSDRSDRSD> tah=tag
[01:35:28] <Cork> webm and h264
[01:35:38] <Cork> and the <video> tag
[01:36:10] <Cork> opps ie <= 9
[01:37:10] <Giusuppe> RSDRSDRSD http://praegnanz.de/html5video/
[01:38:36] <seutje> oh, if u just wanna show video, I'd go with mediaelement or something
[01:47:02] <Acrack> hello, i'm using the data selector of jquery how to not allow user to select some dates ?

[01:49:00] <Cork> heh
[01:49:03] <Cork> Acrack: ^
[01:49:11] <Acrack> yo Cork
[01:49:14] <Acrack> long time :D
[01:49:43] <Acrack> thanks guyz
[01:49:55] <Cork> wasn't really yesterday no
[01:49:57] <Cork> np
[01:51:16] <titii> cork thank u
[01:53:17] <titii> But i have another problem, i am doing onlick in this selector $('.drag-place .users-department .depart-user').click(function(){, where i am replacing there the element into new selector, and i need click event for new selector, but he remeber the old, why?
[01:53:50] <Cork> titii: from what depth are you replacing the elements?
[01:54:30] <Cork> titii: try $(document).on('click', '.drag-place .users-department .depart-user', function(event) {})
[01:54:49] <titii> cork from .drag-place .users-department to .drop-place .selected-users
[01:55:03] <titii> cork ok...
[01:55:04] <Cork> so .drag-place is always pressent?
[01:55:11] <titii> yes
[01:55:20] <Cork> titii: try $('.drag-place').on('click', '.users-department .depart-user', function(event) {})
[02:00:06] <titii> cork hmmm it doesnt work i made it like this: $('.users-department').on('click', '.depart-user', function(){alert(11);...}) because .depart-user is in .users-department, so it would be enough, but it doesnt work ,,, hmmm
[02:09:18] <titii> cork maybe the on is for non existing elements, but this elements exists
[02:09:20] <titii> i dont know
[02:09:27] <titii> but the on doesnt work
[02:17:14] <titii> Cork: I was changed on for delegate, it looks works man
[02:17:29] <Cork> titii: ah, your on an old version of jquery?
[02:18:04] <titii> 1.4.2
[02:20:09] <daslicht> hello,
[02:20:10] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/bCsvh/
[02:20:20] <daslicht> why is therer the selected index undefined?
[02:21:25] <titii> cork thanks 4 assit ;
[02:22:20] <MrTool> daslicht: try it with $(this)[0].selectedIndex
[02:26:18] <daslicht> tahnks !
[02:26:21] <daslicht> that works!
[02:26:59] <Cork> uh, why not just this.selectedIndex ?
[02:28:07] <daslicht> i try
[02:28:38] <daslicht> ha even better !
[02:28:52] <daslicht> how do i get the data-name of the selected option?
[02:31:27] <sahbeewah> $(selected option).data("name")
[02:31:36] <agu10^> location, location, locationA
[02:32:18] <daslicht> $(selected option).data("name") tis doesnt do a thing
[02:32:31] <daslicht> like to show me how you mean it in my fiddle please?
[02:35:28] <daslicht> this.options[this.selectedIndex] thats how I get the option element but it has no method data()
[02:36:48] <soee> is it possible from sortable option add some attributes to all items >
[02:36:49] <soee> ?
[02:37:47] <sahbeewah> daslicht, http://jsfiddle.net/bCsvh/1/
[02:38:44] <daslicht> Thank you very much , thats working either: $('.licenseSelect option:selected' ).data('name')
[02:39:05] <daslicht> but your approch might be better !
[02:40:20] <sahbeewah> works all the same
[02:40:22] <sahbeewah> soee, what do you mean by "sortable option"?
[02:43:20] <soee> sahbeewah, when calling .sortable(options)
[02:47:58] <sahbeewah> oh alright
[02:48:05] <sahbeewah> don't see why it would have such an option
[02:48:22] <sahbeewah> just do it manually? $.each?
[03:01:11] <spobat> how do i escape a string with jquery?
[03:01:18] <spobat> message = $().text(message).html();
[03:01:31] <spobat> I don't know what to put in $() because there isn't actually any element
[03:01:39] <spobat> i just want to escape `message`
[03:01:55] <Cork> $('<div/>').text().html()
[03:02:18] <spobat> right, that works.
[03:02:38] <spobat> thank you! :)
[03:14:20] <daslicht> can you select a option by its name and not ist value ?
[03:15:20] <daslicht> bakc to the fiddle:
[03:15:20] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/rW2XC/4/
[03:15:33] <daslicht> lets say i save the license name in to teh db
[03:15:52] <daslicht> and now if i recall teh page i like to select the option by nname
[03:15:54] <daslicht> name
[03:16:44] <daslicht> if i just would save the index i would have to create another databse table which just contain the licenses
[03:18:04] <boytoy> Howdy!
[03:18:33] <Cork> daslicht: $(select).val($('select').find('option').filter(function() { return $(this).html() === "Match this"; }).attr('value'));
[03:18:54] <daslicht> thank you very much
[03:18:56] <daslicht> i try it !
[03:19:11] <Ankabout> Can I somehow use animate and toggle for the "left" property?
[03:19:37] <Cork> daslicht: the selectors has a lot of typos though...
[03:19:59] <boytoy> Trying to do a mobile-friendly slider/swiper -- http://jsfiddle.net/k3k8F/ -- so far I got it working using SwipeJS, but is the same thing possible with just jQuery Mobile?
[03:20:00] <daslicht> let me try to use it im my fiddle :)
[03:20:05] <Cork> Ankabout: you would have to store the old values
[03:20:41] <Ankabout> so better to do a callback?
[03:20:45] <daslicht> um I like to select the option by data-name
[03:20:56] <daslicht> lets say i save "CC-BY"
[03:21:16] <daslicht> I liek to select the according option which has the data-name="CC-BY"
[03:21:22] <Cork> boytoy: none of them work for me...
[03:21:43] <Cork> boytoy: why don't you just load touch support onto of the normal jquery-ui slider?
[03:22:11] <boytoy> Cork: what?! none of them? 1st one works here in Chrome
[03:22:39] <boytoy> Cork: Im not able to use jquery-ui for this sadly :/
[03:23:10] <Cork> Ankabout: ah, you mean slide animate
[03:23:18] <boytoy> yes, sorry, not range sliders
[03:23:56] <daslicht> its working : http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/rW2XC/5/
[03:24:05] <daslicht> Captain Cork roxx
[03:24:25] <boytoy> captain cork?
[03:24:27] <daslicht> hehe
[03:24:45] <Ankabout> cork, yes basically I want to move a DOM to the right or left on a click
[03:24:47] <daslicht> it was a cross reference to Star Trek ,,, Captain Kirk
[03:24:48] <daslicht> :)
[03:25:07] <daslicht> <-- euphoric
[03:29:07] <Cork> boytoy: the first one only works in webkit and opera
[03:29:37] <Cork> boytoy: and when you go around (3 > 1 or 1 > 3) it aniamtes in the wrong direction
[03:30:35] <Cork> boytoy: btw type in the 3 group
[03:30:38] <Casperin> I'm trying to send some json to a server, but when it hits the server, it seems like lists has turned into objects with their key being the index (0,1,2,3, etc)â€¦ am I sending the wrong format so it does some automatic conversion? Or what is going on?
[03:31:12] <Cork> Casperin: by lists do you mean array?
[03:31:20] <ladislaw> i noticed in some websites after logging in, the user's name is on the top right hand side along with other menu options stacked next to each other.  How is this done? length of each user's name will vary so I assume the container is somehow being resized?
[03:31:23] <Cork> and if so, how are you creating them?
[03:31:27] <Casperin> yeah exactly :)
[03:31:43] <boytoy> Cork: true true, but what you think though, is the same thing possible using just jquery mobile? from jquery mobile's demos it only seems possible to swipe from page to page not from li to li?
[03:31:59] <Casperin> how? I push attributes into an empty array
[03:32:16] <Anticom> hi all
[03:32:22] <Cork> Casperin: so var a = []; a.push(value); a.push(value); a.push(value); ?
[03:32:24] <Casperin> attributes being objects of settings on something
[03:32:32] <Anticom> is there a way to kind of "declare" the buttons in jq ui dialog in html and not in js?
[03:33:14] <Casperin> something like that, yeahâ€¦ where values are other objects
[03:33:27] <Cork> Casperin: and how are you converting it to json?
[03:34:06] <Casperin> ooohâ€¦ I'm not.. I thinkâ€¦ I think I just assumed that if I only use objects and arrays, with strings and numbers, then everything is fine
[03:34:10] <Cork> Anticom: no sadly not, you can get some of it through classes, but not the hover/active effects
[03:34:22] <Casperin> but I have to parse it first?
[03:34:24] <seutje> Anticom: isn't it just text and a handler?
[03:34:33] <Cork> Casperin: jquery will try to send it as params if you do that
[03:34:38] <Casperin> aah
[03:34:46] <Anticom> seutje but i want to preserve jq ui's "magic" ;)
[03:34:53] <Casperin> so JSON.parse( data ); first?
[03:34:57] <Cork> Casperin: data: { json: JSON.stringify(jsonData) }
[03:35:10] <Anticom> thing is i have different button labels that depend on different states of my application data
[03:35:16] <Casperin> stringify?
[03:35:30] <Cork> ya, you want to convert TO json, not from :)
[03:35:51] <Casperin> hmm
[03:36:03] <Casperin> so it's just saved on the server as a giant blob of text
[03:36:31] <Cork> well you will have to parse the json
[03:36:35] <Selena> hello all
[03:36:39] <Casperin> yeah.. when I get it back
[03:36:40] <Selena> can anyone help me?
[03:36:44] <seutje> Anticom: so like $this.dialog({buttons: [{text: $this.data('ui-button-text');}]}) ?
[03:36:49] <Selena> I have problems with ajax and modal windows
[03:37:10] <Selena> I want to dynamically load content in my modal window
[03:37:16] <Casperin> okay that's perfect Cork. I'll give it a go. Thanks a lot!
[03:37:17] <Casperin> :)
[03:37:29] <Anticom> seutje seems legit :)
[03:37:39] <Casperin> (and bravo for doing multi tasking tech support :))
[03:37:42] <seutje> Anticom: u can set change them at any time with the setter method
[03:37:52] <Anticom> there's no need
[03:38:01] <Anticom> it's just a decision wether an action is payed or not
[03:38:02] <Anticom> ^^
[03:38:29] <Selena> Anyone able to help me with Modal Windows and ajax loading ?
[03:38:36] <feierabendyogi> I'm trying to create a widget people can embed on their site to display a calendar from a central site. Unfortunately I run into errors using getScript and initializing the full calendar. A code snippet can be seen here: http://pastebin.com/ihGwytae
[03:38:58] <Selena> I can't get it working properly, it works only on first click on first link i click.. then the rest have same content all time
[03:39:02] <feierabendyogi> error is Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fullCalendar'
[03:40:36] <Selena> Anyone?
[03:40:39] <feierabendyogi> Also, it works fine if I do not use the getScript method
[03:40:52] <seutje> Selena: use the callback in the getscript call
[03:40:54] <feierabendyogi> but load the fullcalendar.js directly from the html file
[03:40:55] <Anticom> Selena just load your text into your target DOM node and then initialize the dialog
[03:41:12] <Selena> let me give you code i have in pastebin to see
[03:41:48] <Selena> http://pastebin.com/pYhtrv2p
[03:41:49] <ravenzz> Selena do you have testcase?
[03:41:51] <quietschie> Hi, can anybody tell me how to find a input tag that is nested within divs, spans, tables with jquery by its attribute name?? was trying sth. like $('input[name|="KostÃ¼mteil anlegen[Basisteil]"]') but that didn't work in the big context.
[03:41:55] <Selena> Here, take a look please
[03:41:59] <ravenzz> Selena we can't debug text
[03:42:04] <Selena> what is testcase, sorry not aware of it
[03:42:10] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Selena
[03:42:10] <b-ot> Selena: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:42:39] <Selena> Ravenzz, its hard to provide you the jsfiddle since it use database.
[03:42:51] <seutje> feierabendyogi: http://pastebin.com/0fAV0h3e
[03:43:07] <Selena> But take a look at pastebin tell me what you think about it?
[03:43:11] <ravenzz> I don't need the whole applicaton, just a code snippet that reproduce the behaviour
[03:43:19] <Selena> Ok
[03:43:23] <Selena> Let me try do that, thanks
[03:43:27] <Anticom> seutje when was .getScript method introduced? :O
[03:43:32] <Anticom> that's a new one isn't it?
[03:43:40] <seutje> ?getscript
[03:43:41] <ravenzz> Anticom  a while ago
[03:43:42] <feierabendyogi> @seutje: muchas gracias
[03:43:47] <Anticom> cool
[03:43:54] <Anticom> hasta lavista require.js :D
[03:43:55] <seutje> Anticom: it says 1.0
[03:44:17] <seutje> getscript doesn't care about your AMD modules though :P
[03:44:18] <pachet> it's been around a while, yeah
[03:44:21] <ravenzz> Anticom it has nothing to do with RequireJS
[03:44:35] <seutje> Anticom: it's just a convenience wrapper around $.ajax()
[03:44:45] <ravenzz> seutje wrong
[03:45:03] <seutje> cool
[03:45:41] <ravenzz> it just create a new script tag and append it to the DOM, optionally assigning a function onload
[03:45:46] <Anticom> seutje but as you might know software developers are lazy people and condensing functionionality in a single line for a specific but common use case is always a good thing :)
[03:45:46] <ravenzz> iirc
[03:46:05] <systemfault> comparing getScript with require.jsâ€¦. LOL
[03:46:07] <seutje> not sure when I disputed that, but alright
[03:46:32] <ravenzz> seutje you didn't :)
[03:46:34] <seutje> Anticom: I hate .load
[03:46:57] <seutje> so I'm just generally wrong?
[03:46:57] <ravenzz> you couldn't load script from other domains with $.ajax
[03:47:01] <Selena> ravenzz, http://jsfiddle.net/jNHHR/
[03:47:16] <seutje> "This is a shorthand Ajax function, which is equivalent to:"
[03:47:23] <Selena> ravenzz, you have it there, just click on open modal or something and you see the box will appear
[03:47:29] <seutje> guess someone better update the docs then
[03:47:51] <Selena> ravenzz, the problem i have is that the content from that box.. is not dynamically working, only first time. Then the 2nd button will load same as 1st button
[03:48:33] <_MagePsycho> when you scroll down the page, you will see the foloating menu bar at the top: http://jadopado.com/
[03:48:41] <_MagePsycho> what is this called and where to find the plugins
[03:48:45] <ravenzz> seutje I could be wrong, but that's my Vanilla version http://pastebin.com/e7tM1q4c and it works
[03:50:05] <seutje> ravenzz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L697
[03:50:40] <Selena> ravenzz, let me know when you take a look and tell me what you think i made wrong there. Thanks
[03:51:24] <seutje> ravenzz: and here's the get function declaration https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L197
[03:52:36] <ravenzz> seutje yeah
[03:54:18] <chilversc_> can I stop jQuery from automatically removing the script tags for dynamically loaded scripts?
[03:54:58] <chilversc_> the script is part of a larger html fragment that is being added to the dom using append
[03:56:07] <quietschie> Hi, can anybody tell me how to find a input tag that is nested within divs, spans, tables with jquery by its attribute name?? was trying sth. like $('input[name|="KostÃ¼mteil anlegen[Basisteil]"]') but that didn't work in the big context.
[03:56:13] <Selena> ravenzz, http://jsfiddle.net/jNHHR/ here is the link if you can take a look
[03:56:22] <ravenzz> Selena yep
[03:56:26] <ravenzz> hold on
[03:56:46] <Selena> ravenzz, ok sure take your time;p and thanks a lot for your efforts.
[03:57:11] <pachet> chilversc_: no
[03:57:28] <pachet> why do you need to prevent its removal
[03:57:29] <ravenzz> seutje my bad I thought it wasn't possible to do cross-domain requests
[03:57:42] <ravenzz> pachet how getScript is able to do cross-domain requests?
[03:57:47] <seutje> this is the future!
[03:57:54] <chilversc_> pachet: I want to debug the script, but chrome doesn't show the script once its been removed from the dom
[03:58:02] <ravenzz> is it because of the mime-type?
[03:58:22] <chilversc_> and I can't use the //@ script since I do not control the script
[03:58:43] <pachet> ravenzz: you can set cross-domain headers in the request response
[03:58:47] <pachet> if you control the server
[03:58:54] <pachet> ?g CORS nicholas zakas
[03:58:55] <b-ot> pachet: Cross-domain Ajax with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing | NCZOnline â†’ http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/05/25/cross-domain-ajax-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing/
[03:59:17] <ravenzz> pachet sure
[03:59:51] <ravenzz> but I think that it works anyway
[04:00:09] <chilversc_> pachet: so I was hoping for a simple way when developing to temporarily stop the scripts being removed from the dom, otherwise I'm going to have to put this through a proxy of some sort, parse the dom, find the script tag and append a //@ source thing to it
[04:00:47] <pachet> ravenzz: oh im sorry, you're asking about getScript specifically
[04:00:53] <pachet> yes, it works cross domain by definition
[04:01:07] <pachet> just the same way that you can load jquery from google
[04:01:12] <pachet> or an image from AWS
[04:01:21] <ravenzz> ok but why?
[04:01:32] <ravenzz> or how :P
[04:01:49] <ravenzz> is it because there is no restriction on text/javascript
[04:01:50] <ravenzz> ?
[04:02:12] <veQue> ie is a pain

[04:06:41] <quietschie> Hi, can anybody tell me how to find a input tag that is nested within divs, spans, tables with jquery by its attribute name?? was trying sth. like $('input[name|="KostÃ¼mteil anlegen[Basisteil]"]') but that didn't work in the big context.
[04:07:32] <petoo> I am trying to select some text in textarea on double click and not just one word. How should I accomplish this?
[04:09:00] <chilversc_> meh, I can't even patch the script up before adding it to the dom, as var parsed = $(html); strips out the script tag at that moment
[04:09:52] <Selena> anyone can take a look at -> http://jsfiddle.net/jNHHR/ ?
[04:10:17] <Selena> how can i load in the dialog window with ajax dynamic content depending on the id=""
[04:10:27] <StephenS>  how video processing is done on facebook, when someone put link in status bar?
[04:10:38] <anew> how can i set and check cookies without page refreshes ?
[04:11:21] <spobat> how can I animate these appends? http://jsfiddle.net/dHbGm/
[04:11:47] <spobat> I've found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1520178/jquery-using-append-with-effects
[04:11:51] <spobat> but the syntax looks a bit wird
[04:11:52] <spobat> weird*
[04:12:10] <spobat> because I'd end up from 2 to probably 10 lines of code :(
[04:13:40] <pachet> ravenzz: sorry, just got done eating breakfast
[04:13:44] <pachet> that's actually an excellent question
[04:13:56] <spobat> okay, I use .hide().show('slow');
[04:14:01] <spobat> #works
[04:14:06] <Selena> ravenzz is eating atm :)
[04:14:11] <pachet> the real answer is that scripts and images and CSS actually ARE subject to the same cross-origin restrictions
[04:14:15] <pachet> Selena: oh
[04:14:24] <pachet> well, he'll have something to read when he gets back :]
[04:14:34] <Selena> indeed
[04:15:16] <Guest22169> hi all, i have a question about html placeholders on dynamically created form text inputs, any takers?
[04:15:19] <pachet> ravenzz: so while you're able to load and execute a remote script, you're not actually able to see the script contents as text
[04:15:43] <pachet> just as you're not able to see the actual text of a CSS file that you've loaded remotely
[04:15:53] <pachet> or view the pixeldata of images loaded in the same way
[04:16:08] <pachet> but you can apply all of these things to the page
[04:16:23] <pachet> whereas in the case of something like JSON, the text content is the only thing you're interested in
[04:16:50] <pachet> so the fact that you don't have access to that is a little more opaque
[04:17:16] <Stephen-B> HTML Placeholders, in IE9.  The placeholders for static form text inputs work as expected, but those elements that I add dynamically via jQuery don't show the placeholder text as the input is assigned value"", any ideas?
[04:18:57] <pachet> Stephen-B: i didnt think that ie9 supported placeholder attrs
[04:19:41] <Selena> packet can you take for me  a look at http://jsfiddle.net/jNHHR/
[04:20:00] <Selena> I am trying to load in my modal window (dialog window) the content dynamically with ajax
[04:20:29] <mo_roodi> Stephen-B: any chance you can create a fiddle showing us the code?
[04:20:33] <chilversc_> Stephen-B: I tried it, and I don't get placeholders at all, static or otherwise in IE9
[04:20:44] <chilversc_> Stephen-B: this is what you were trying? http://jsfiddle.net/Mgqcd/1/
[04:20:52] <Selena> but i have problems.. it doesn't load it properly, as you can see i request an id="" and each <a class=""> have an different id, but my site will just take the first id that was clicked and ignore rest
[04:21:19] <Selena> so its wroking just on the first button you click
[04:21:31] <Stephen-B> http://37.220.92.92:81/Apply-for-finance-online.asp, the phone numbers have a placeholder that works but the time at address doesnt
[04:21:40] <hekep> http://jsfiddle.net/dSF5t/4/  no pop-up
[04:21:58] <Selena> on the next one, if you click that has different ID it will fail.. it will load same content as first one although i did click on different id
[04:22:03] <Stephen-B> not the time at address is dynamically created (but copying a hidden temp version of the section)
[04:22:06] <Stephen-B> *note
[04:23:23] <anew> hey anyone can help me with cookies ? how can i set them without page refreshes? ajax ?
[04:24:33] <Stephen-B> Anew: You can just call a js function to do the cookies http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp
[04:24:55] <anew> stephen-b the js function would have to do an xhr request wouldnt it ?
[04:25:09] <pachet> Selena: well, AJAX is hard to replicate in jsfiddle
[04:25:24] <pachet> also you're kind of only half leveraging jquery
[04:25:42] <pachet> there's a lot of ducktyping and manual labor that you can factor out since you know you're already using $
[04:25:43] <Selena> But you understood my problem?
[04:25:51] <pachet> only vaguely
[04:25:59] <pachet> i'm probably not the best person to help
[04:26:05] <Selena> so let me explain once again, you see the 2 links?
[04:26:06] <pachet> running around doing morning time things
[04:26:11] <Selena> each link has a id="'
[04:26:13] <Stephen-B> Anew: no
[04:26:30] <Selena> when i click that link my jquery will launch a dialog box
[04:26:41] <Selena> and ajax will extract based on that ID the content
[04:26:44] <pachet> oh
[04:26:46] <pachet> no, it wont
[04:26:46] <Selena> from a php file
[04:26:48] <Stephen-B> Anew: Check out that link I sent you, you can create cookies within the js function
[04:26:51] <Selena> why not?
[04:26:56] <Selena> It works atm, and it does so :P
[04:26:56] <pachet> its getting the first id of all the elements with class 'mata'
[04:26:59] <Selena> i have a ad.php file
[04:27:06] <Selena> ahhh...
[04:27:06] <pachet> so it'll be the same every time
[04:27:08] <Selena> damn it :(
[04:27:10] <Selena> that's my problem
[04:27:15] <Selena> so how i can damnly solve that
[04:27:19] <Selena> that is my issue exactly
[04:27:26] <Selena> it does only first:|
[04:27:31] <Selena> instead of doing it for each
[04:28:12] <pachet> Selena: try replacing $('.mata').attr('id') with $(this).attr('id')
[04:28:21] <pachet> or just 'this.id'
[04:28:24] <anew> stephen-b i thought cookies are sent in the head of a http reuqest?
[04:28:45] <Selena> oh jesus ok :P let me try that... wow if that works you salved my ass. Struggling for 2 days already on this
[04:28:49] <chilversc_> Stephen-B: does this reproduce the problem? http://jsfiddle.net/Mgqcd/1/
[04:29:29] <Selena> packet you mean    url: "ad.php?id=" +  $(this).attr('id'),
[04:29:31] <Selena> this right?
[04:29:57] <Stephen-B> I think i figured it out, I'm using a js fix to allow placeholders to function in unsupported browsers but this fix only runs once on document load, hence the dynamically created elements do not benefit from this, so need to recall the fix when the dynamic elements are added
[04:30:07] <pachet> Selena: yeah
[04:30:25] <Selena> packet you solved it i think :P wow :d i think that was it, jesus!!
[04:30:36] <Selena> packet, let me make few more tests but it seems it works correctly now
[04:31:03] <petoo> who's packet, by the way?
[04:31:15] <Selena> I am trying now to figure out how i can close the dialog box once i open it since its not a plugin
[04:31:27] <Stephen-B> Anew: Are you just looking for a page to create a cookie when it's loaded, or on a user action?
[04:31:31] <Selena> Cuz right now it works, to open it i can see the content that i extract with ajax
[04:31:43] <Selena> but i cannot close it to click on the 2nd link to see it it loads different
[04:32:23] <anew> stephen-b i'm talking about specifically for logins and seeing if the user is authorized to be on ur site
[04:33:23] <pachet> petoo: my doppleganger
[04:34:42] <petoo> I assumed it's you :)
[04:34:54] <petoo> already
[04:37:38] <Stephen-B> anew: tbh you wouldn't use cookies for that since they are easily spoofed, you want to use sessions.  The cookies could be used to allow the user to remember their login details for the site
[04:38:09] <anew> yes that's exactly what i want to do, how can i implement sessions with ajax? is that possible stephen-b ?
[04:38:52] <Stephen-B> anew: yes you can easily use an ajax call to check the credentials and create the appropriate session
[04:39:58] <Grundell> Hello have a site http://dressupinyou.se/prisjamforelse-av-hemlarm/ in the bottom there is a responsive data table, is it possible to make a script that allows you to have MAX x amount of checked boxes when in mobile view? (youll understand what i mean when you see it)
[04:40:10] <ravenzz> pachet uhm interesting, so basically getScript doesn't append a script/link/img to the DOM!?
[04:40:23] <Stephen-B> anew: so you want a login box, that when submitted sends the data via an ajax request to an page that authorises this data and creates the appropriate session.  Then on all the pages you need to check this session variable to confirm that the user is authorised
[04:40:50] <ravenzz> also I wonder how it is "executed"
[04:41:04] <Olive6767> I'm trying to call a function using its name from a string: http://jsfiddle.net/Z7LyL/ => It doesn't work, is this a namespace problem?
[04:41:08] <anew> ok so stephen-b 'check the session variable' has nothing to do with cookies is that correct ?
[04:45:06] <Stephen-B> anew: indeed
[04:45:17] <Stephen-B> sessions are based on the server, cookies on the client
[04:45:32] <anew> ok last question stephen-b ... once the user is logged in and there are no page refreshes after that point
[04:45:45] <anew> with EVERY ajax call do i have to check if user session is logged in?
[04:45:51] <anew> seems like a lot of work for every single ajax call
[04:47:00] <Stephen-B> anew: depends on what you are trying to achieve, but in theory yes, but checking a session variable is simply just a line of code
[04:47:35] <anew> this line of code i would put server side
[04:47:36] <anew> ok
[04:47:42] <anew> i think i am understanding
[04:47:44] <anew> thanks a lot
[04:50:03] <Stephen-B> anew: hope you get on OK with your profect

[05:10:51] <Stephen-B> sorry Olive I'm not sure
[05:12:57] <spobat> hi
[05:13:07] <spobat> how can I check if ANY <input type='text'> is focused.
[05:13:16] <spobat> I don't want to know which, just if.
[05:14:16] <vncatalin> $("..").is(":focus")
[05:14:21] <vncatalin> just like that
[05:15:08] <spobat> ".." really?
[05:15:21] <spobat> where does that check if it's a input type text
[05:15:51] <vncatalin> ".." is the selector :)
[05:16:01] <Cork> $('input[type="text"]').is(':focus')
[05:16:12] <vncatalin> like Cork said
[05:16:51] <spobat> right, I see. Thank you guys
[05:17:05] <Cork> though that said, that is a fairly slow selector, so if you plan to check it a lot make sure to cache the selector
[05:19:30] <spobat> Cork, good suggestions
[05:19:33] <spobat> suggestion*
[05:19:41] <spobat> you mean that I should just put in in a local variable?
[05:19:48] <spobat> global*
[05:19:48] <seutje> yes
[05:20:02] <seutje> well, no, as local as possible
[05:21:10] <spobat> yes, i'm calling it alot. on each click so to say!
[05:21:27] <spobat> seutje, like that? http://ideone.com/ZyKO6I
[05:21:40] <spobat> goal: if no other edittext is focused, focus `submit-message`
[05:21:54] <Cork> spobat: no, but it just before the click handler line
[05:22:07] <spobat> okay, that's a global variable then, right?
[05:22:10] <seutje> this would re-evaluate the selector on each click
[05:22:17] <Cork> if you don't have a scope around the handler; yes
[05:22:26] <spobat> yes, i thought so. But you confused me seutje :D
[05:22:34] <spobat> alright
[05:22:45] <seutje> spobat: http://ideone.com/8O1S9C
[05:22:45] <Cork> spobat: he meant don't make it global if you don't have to
[05:23:23] <Cork> and that is only necessary if you feel you need to hide it
[05:23:24] <spobat> seutje, is this the best practice for things like that?
[05:23:33] <seutje> or if ur making it global, at least namespace it like window.myApp.someVar;
[05:23:35] <Cork> spobat: scopes are you friend!
[05:23:40] <spobat> of course :D
[05:23:50] <seutje> ?g iife
[05:23:50] <b-ot> seutje: Ben Alman Â» Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) â†’ http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[05:23:52] <bot-t> seutje, Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) - http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[05:23:54] <spobat> ty
[05:24:34] <Cork> seutje: there is little point in adding an extra object for global variables
[05:24:43] <spobat> seutje, for now I prefix all globals with _
[05:24:45] <spobat> like _userName
[05:24:53] <Cork> uh
[05:24:58] <spobat> cruel?
[05:25:14] <Cork> _ is usually used for protected names
[05:25:23] <seutje> some use it for constants
[05:25:25] <Cork> so you might get a bit of naming conflict there
[05:25:55] <spobat> for constants I_USE_THIS
[05:25:58] <Cork> js 1.5 don't have constants :
[05:26:03] <Cork> * ;)
[05:31:08] <titii> why in a $('.department-overlay .button-right a').click(function() { ... $('#form-add-department').submit(function(){ ... doesnt work? but $('#form-add-department').submit() works?
[05:31:40] <titii> function in function or what?
[05:34:18] <seutje> .submit() triggers a submit
[05:34:28] <seutje> .submit(fn) binds a function to submit events
[05:34:36] <petoo> How to select all text in textarea, on doubleclick?
[05:34:40] <seutje> this is why I hate the convenience methods
[05:35:03] <seutje> petoo: isn't that native behavior?
[05:35:20] <seutje> or is double click only the word, and tripple click the line?
[05:35:30] <petoo> seutje: not all text can be selected.
[05:36:06] <petoo> suppose you have "How are you " , then it only select the text on which you doublicked
[05:36:15] <petoo> double-clicked*
[05:36:31] <titii> seutje: ok but in a submit function alert doesnt work, why?
[05:36:51] <titii> check this http://chopapp.com/#e2bqf8er
[05:37:35] <seutje> alerts halt execution
[05:38:01] <spobat> is there a jquery-uii channel?
[05:38:25] <seutje> titii: why are u only binding the submit handler after the link was clicked?
[05:38:59] <seutje> petoo: oh like that... I know cross-browser selection ranges are a pain in the ass, so I don't think I'll be much help
[05:39:35] <titii> seutje: because i have there an anchor button to submit the link
[05:39:36] <seutje> but don't most browsers select all the text in a textare upon focus?
[05:39:38] <titii> the form
[05:39:50] <seutje> titii: it would really help to know what ur trying to do
[05:40:03] <seutje> so there's a link, what happens when someone clicks it?
[05:40:19] <seutje> does it submit the form, or does it bind something to be executed when the form does get submitted?
[05:40:38] <scotdb> Is jquery dataTables fnDraw async ?    I call fnDraw and then test for the dataTables_empty class (to see if the table has been populated).   It sometimes returns false when it should be true ...
[05:41:16] <titii> seutje: ok, if i click on the anchor, so first to check my array is not empty if (userInDepartment.length !== 0) then submit the form, you know?
[05:41:51] <seutje> scotdb: the documentation doesn't specify a return value for that method
[05:42:11] <seutje> titii: remove the function in the submit() call
[05:42:21] <seutje> that will trigger submit when clicking the link
[05:43:07] <titii> seutje: ooo i see, i can make an condition on a click event :)
[05:43:24] <seutje> titii: sure
[05:43:34] <titii> :)
[05:43:48] <seutje> but I would bind a handler to the submit event, have that do the conditional stuff and then have the link simply trigger the submit
[05:44:50] <spobat> hi
[05:45:02] <spobat> are these awesome, draggable lists also available vertically?
[05:45:02] <spobat> http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#default
[05:45:14] <titii> seutje: mmm, but for my english its little bit hard to understand what u mean
[05:46:10] <scotdb> seutje : I realise there is no return parameter.   I call "mytable.fnDraw;" and then "if ($'#selector-to-first-td').hasClass("dataTables_empty"))" .... sometimes returns true and sometimes false for the same scenario
[05:47:35] <scotdb> If I put an alert in before the test (so that I build in a delay) it always seems to work
[05:47:55] <seutje> scotdb: oh sorry, I misunderstood
[05:53:48] <scotdb> Looks like there is an fnDrawCallback which will execute once the draw is complete
[05:54:08] <seutje> scotdb: was looking for the same, but their docs are so hard to navigate
[05:54:25] <seutje> I can find an fnInitComplete, but that prolly won't re-run when redrawin
[05:54:26] <seutje> g
[05:55:00] <seutje> oh wow, I just suck at the internet, their docs are fine: http://datatables.net/usage/callbacks
[05:56:37] <scotdb> seutje : I do agree with you on the docs however.   Sometimes I feel like I need a "jQuery for Dummies" (and "Datatables for Dummies")
[05:57:19] <seutje> but... jQuery is like "JavaScript for Dummies"
[05:58:02] <seutje> personally, I don't rly like how datatables' default caching functions work
[05:58:06] <scotdb> Of course my next problem is that I'm populating two tables and I need to take an action if BOTH are empty ... oh joy !!!
[05:58:35] <seutje> like if u page back, it'll re-request the same stuff from the servert
[05:58:38] <seutje> server*
[05:59:16] <scotdb> Actually I'm more than happy to have extra db access ;-)   But then I'm a DB guy pretending to be a programmer
[05:59:39] <seutje> oh, and the fact that you can only customize strings and can't pass in jquery collections or w/e
[06:00:02] <seutje> like, this is my search string: '_INPUT_ <button onclick="javascript:window.jQuery && jQuery(this).parent().children(\'input\').trigger(\'filter\');">Filter</button>'
[06:00:16] <seutje> gross, right?
[06:02:59] <moijk> i seem to have a problem determining which kind of element(s) has the id / class or name i'm asking for. Tried .tagName, .get(0).tagName, [0].tagName, and .nodeName with the same. also prop-variants and attr that i've seen. ideas?
[06:13:32] <Cork> moijk: read the last sentence of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Node.nodeName
[06:14:15] <Cork> attr will always be wrong, but prop('tagName'), .get(0).tagName or [0].tagName doesn't matter
[06:14:18] <Cork> its all the same thing
[06:15:01] <Onkeltem> Hi all
[06:15:43] <Onkeltem> I'm getting error message in Chrome Dev Tools console but I don't understand WHERE the error occurs and can't find the problematic place. Here is the image: http://drupal.org/files/Screenshot%20from%202013-03-27%2017:03:10.png
[06:16:20] <Onkeltem> As you see both message just useless
[06:17:28] <Cork> one ins in Drupal.behaviors.views_infinite_scroll.attach, the other in loadOnScroll
[06:18:05] <Selena> Cork, how can i run this function in a click event? window.onunload = function () { 	dialogFocuser = focusedElement = modal = dialog = body = html = null; }; ?
[06:18:23] <Selena> i put window.onunload() ?
[06:18:32] <Onkeltem> Cork: why it doesn't prints line numbers?
[06:18:46] <Cork> Selena: as your using eventproperties, ya
[06:19:00] <Cork> Onkeltem: drupal.js:76
[06:19:28] <Onkeltem> Cork: it is not implementation of of views_infinite_scroll.attach. The latter is in another file
[06:19:29] <Selena> Ok Cork, lets see
[06:19:54] <Cork> Selena: i would recommend not using those old dom functions though
[06:20:30] <StephenS> what is the event/trigger while starting to type, to show search box?
[06:20:33] <Selena> Cork, what you suggest then? what shall i use?
[06:20:37] <Giusuppe> set your Debugger to pause on errors...
[06:20:50] <Selena> you talk about onunload() ?
[06:21:00] <Cork> Giusuppe: keydown => keypress => keyup
[06:21:27] <Cork> Selena: on<eventname> = function() {} (or even worse on<eventname> = "javascript";
[06:21:29] <Cork> )
[06:22:20] <Onkeltem> Giusuppe: and Chrome Dev Tools can do that?
[06:22:57] <Giusuppe> yes, Sources tab, bottom fourth icons from the left...
[06:23:26] <Cork> not though, it will break deep down into the different frameworks
[06:23:31] <Cork> *note
[06:23:38] <Giusuppe> Click twice, so it becomes purple instead of blue, or it'll break on caught errors too
[06:26:08] <Onkeltem> Giusuppe: thanks a lot!
[06:26:19] <Giusuppe> no problem
[06:26:23] <soee> i have applied sortable on table, now after order is changed this table is updated via ajax - how can i make it again sortable after content is replaced with ajax >
[06:27:56] <Cork> soee: you have to run the sortable on it again, unless you update the old ul list
[06:27:59] <Cork> sorry table
[06:30:00] <soee> Cork, what would be the best way to run it wgain with the same settings if table content is changed on success
[06:30:42] <Cork> add it in a function and call the function again
[06:53:38] <titii> Friend, what specific attribute can i use for some HTML5 elements to mark that element i want to dynamically translate?
[06:54:03] <wroathe> I just set up basic mass vhosting in my config... now on my dev sites I get something along these lines in the apache error log: Request exceeded the limit of 10 internal redirects due to probable configuration error.
[06:54:07] <wroathe> Any thoughts?
[06:54:32] <pachet> titii: Pal, classes?
[06:54:47] <titii> pachet: what is Pal?
[06:54:57] <pachet> a synonym for Friend
[06:55:18] <wroathe> lololol
[06:55:21] <titii> classes is not so good - many classes
[06:55:31] <titii> is not here some more specific?
[06:55:41] <titii> data-lang is only for LI?
[06:56:09] <chilversc_> wroathe: you're being redirected/bounced from url to url, I'd check the http traffic to see what you're being redirected to
[06:57:04] <pachet> titii: when you say you're 'dynamically translating' the content, i'm assuming you're doing that with javascript
[06:57:16] <titii> pachet: yes
[06:57:25] <pachet> if that's the case, you want selector specificity for the sake of performance
[06:58:00] <pachet> in which case, classes should work fine?
[06:58:01] <titii> so class is more performance?
[06:58:16] <titii> pachet: is here some other solution to performance?
[06:58:22] <pachet> sure
[06:58:23] <pachet> use ids
[06:58:36] <titii> :D some else?
[06:59:25] <wroathe> chilversc_: In the error logs it shows a few odd things. I'll post a log again in a few seconds.
[07:01:43] <chilversc_> wroathe: why not also look at what the actual http request/responses are?
[07:02:39] <Selena> pachet, tell me shall i use json datatype for load content on modal window? or just basic ajax?
[07:03:39] <pachet> uh
[07:03:43] <pachet> ajax is not a datatype
[07:05:26] <Thoams> hi - having a spot of trouble with my selector
[07:05:45] <pachet> if you dont specify a datatype, $.ajax will take its cue from the content-type header on the req response from the server
[07:05:54] <wroathe> chilversc_: https://gist.github.com/JustinChristensen/36992945b22445ce7471
[07:06:10] <Thoams> if(jQuery("[rel^=coordinating]:contains(repl)").length == 0)   --   need to look through all elements with rel="coordinating" to find if they contain a given variable, think I'm nearly there but not quite
[07:06:12] <wroathe> chilversc_: I am looking at them... not quite sure why it would do that.
[07:06:19] <pachet> Selena: eg if you omit the dataType prop on the $.ajax parameter obj, and the server returns something with Content-Type : application/json, jquery will still parse that as an object
[07:06:30] <wroathe> Oh, how did I get to jquery?
[07:06:32] <wroathe> Lol
[07:06:35] <wroathe> I thought I was in apache
[07:06:37] <wroathe> cya
[07:10:45] <tomshreds> Hi! I'm getting the hover event on an element in a list. I'd like to know which one (in ascending order) it is. So basically for the third element I'd like to get 3 for example. Any idea on how to quickly do so? The only I found was by looping and counting
[07:11:06] <pachet> ?.index() @ tomshreds
[07:11:07] <bot-t> tomshreds, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:11:29] <tomshreds> nice! thanks
[07:12:58] <shahzad_sab> hi i am using as ajax call to upload a file along with the id using formData object but when i try access formData i am unable to do so, can suggesstion?
[07:13:26] <pachet> access it where
[07:13:29] <pachet> on the server?
[07:13:56] <shahzad_sab> in php
[07:14:03] <shahzad_sab> yes
[07:14:44] <shahzad_sab> i saw in firebug that contents is posted along with the timestamps
[07:15:01] <Thoams> okay, wasn't my fault... stupid markup
[07:15:57] <Thoams> next question:
[07:16:33] <Thoams> need to find out whether or not a given string of text appears in the DOM after a given element
[07:17:22] <Cork> Thoams: dom doesn't really provide a way to find text
[07:19:03] <Thoams> ah, crap.
[07:19:13] * Thoams tries to solve a different problem.
[07:21:11] <DavidScherer> Is there a way to keep the page from moving around when an element changes sizes?
[07:21:59] <Cork> DavidScherer: position all element absolutely
[07:22:28] <DavidScherer> I'm in bootstrap.
[07:23:35] <Cork> DavidScherer: if you modify the page asynchronously after load has triggered, it will jump around
[07:23:57] <Cork> option is to hide the elements, or make it all happen synchronously
[07:24:03] <DavidScherer> What's happening is I query our backend service that returns some formatted HTML. This is stored in a div that collapses when a loading div is un-collapsed. When the POST completes and I have the HTML from the REST I hide the loading div and show the HTML div.
[07:24:40] <DavidScherer> The HTML part can change sizes (depending on what is returned) but since it's close to the bottom of a smallish page the user has to scroll again once it's finished loading and displayed to see the results.
[07:25:53] <Cork> ah, the old offset problem
[07:26:38] <Cork> DavidScherer: a common solution for that is to have some form of padding at the bottom (ex. a footnote) that prevents the collapsing from pushing the page up
[07:27:21] <StephenS> when I do search on div, dropbox div content is wrong.. how can I make it like fb?
[07:28:13] <DavidScherer> Cork: So I need the equivilent of a ton of <br />s below my "working div"?
[07:28:45] <Cork> DavidScherer: or just a margin-bottom
[07:29:01] <Cork> DavidScherer: scroll works through an offset from the top of the screen
[07:29:09] <Cork> but the viewport can't go past the end of the page
[07:29:26] <Cork> so if it hits the end the offset is reduced so it is at the end
[07:29:39] <Cork> that is what triggers your problem
[07:29:41] <DavidScherer> Is there an easy way for the last thing I do in the script to change where the page is positioned in the viewport?
[07:29:54] <Cork> window.scrolltop
[07:31:19] <Cork> ah no
[07:31:22] <Cork> its scrollX on window
[07:31:32] <uArch> hi there... $('.container').mousewheel(function(event, delta) { //Something}); is throwing "TypeError: $(...).mousewheel is not a function"... because all my stuff is inside a function... anyone has some doc about this? how to change the code to work inside a function? I'm not understanding this... thank you in advance
[07:31:36] <Cork> ... scrollY >_<
[07:32:18] <Cork> uArch: are you sure mousewheel has a quick reference in jquery?
[07:32:50] <Cork> try $().on('mousewheel', function() {})
[07:32:59] <uArch> Cork, as a mater of fact, you're right... thanks: <script src="js/jquery.mousewheel.js">

[07:35:37] <ezrafree> hello
[07:35:56] <ezrafree> any reasons why this would be returning null now that i've upgraded to jquery 1.9: inputVal.match(/\./g).length
[07:36:25] <ezrafree> if i console log just inputVal.match it returns "." but then the .length fails
[07:37:00] <Stereo> hi everyone
[07:37:02] <Cork> ezrafree: that command depends on javascript not jquery
[07:37:39] <ezrafree> Cork: that's true, but the failure started occuring only when i upgraded my jquery from 1.8 to 1.9 so i'm just wondering if there's something wrong with my syntax or what
[07:37:43] <Cork> ezrafree: if you can show an example of the string your using it would help
[07:37:56] <Stereo> I'd like to do an ajax call to another domain, and do one thing if I get a 401 error, another thing if I get a 200 back. I'm not even sure that's technically possible?
[07:37:58] <Cork> ezrafree: if its from jquery its not for that line
[07:38:04] <ezrafree> Cork: the string in this case is whatever the user typed into the text input
[07:38:16] <Stereo> will the browser pass the 401 error to the javascript, or will the user get a login/password prompt?
[07:38:25] <Cork> Stereo: cross domain ajax calls is blocked by browsers
[07:38:51] <Cork> ezrafree: i meant i need an explicit example of the problem so i can run it
[07:39:02] <Stereo> what if I use jsonp for the return?
[07:39:03] <amaroks> Hello, does this look good? 	if (!jq instanceof jQuery) { jq = jQuery.noCnflict(); }
[07:39:09] <Cork> cause what your explaining can't be a problem cause
[07:39:17] <Cork> Stereo: jsonp isn't ajax
[07:39:24] <ezrafree> Cork: the error is: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null on line 1387, and that line contains: if (inputVal.match(/\./g).length > 1) {
[07:39:47] <Cork> Stereo: its just a <script src="http://url-to-server.jsonp"></script>
[07:39:49] <Stereo> I know, I meant what if I use jsonp instead?
[07:39:59] <dcherman> ezrafree: that just means your regex didn't match anything.  it's returning null.  null doesn't have .length
[07:39:59] <Cork> ezrafree: code not error message
[07:40:14] <Stereo> Cork: hmm, so the browser *will* prompt the user when it gets a 401 back, won't it?
[07:40:30] <dcherman> ezrafree: if you just want to know if it matches, just /\./g.test( invputVal )
[07:40:35] <Cork> Stereo: don't think it will for a js script tag
[07:41:46] <omani_> I want to run some code inside firebug but I get
[07:41:46] <omani_> SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[07:41:47] <omani_> [Break On This Error] 	
[07:41:47] <omani_> jobQueue([1], [2]) {
[07:42:18] <amaroks> Hello, does this look good? if (!jq instanceof jQuery) { jq = jQuery.noConflict(); }
[07:42:20] <omani_> function name is jobQueue and my params are two json objects
[07:42:37] <omani_> what am I missing. or say where am I missing ;?
[07:42:37] <Cork> omani_: you can't have a {} after a function call
[07:42:50] <ezrafree> Cork: strangely, if i seperate the code out into a jsfiddle, it works: http://jsfiddle.net/UCEQv/
[07:42:53] <omani_> but this is how a function looks like in javascript
[07:43:09] <omani_> I have the whole function defined in console
[07:43:24] <Stereo> to tell you a bit more about what I'm doing - I want to attempt windows ntlm authentication in the background, and fail silently if it doesn't work
[07:43:30] <Grundell> hello, now that im done with my site i was planing to gzip all the js files... how do i do this?
[07:43:36] <Cork> ezrafree: that just means that it happens somewhere else, and it is just visible here
[07:43:57] <Cork> Grundell: enable gzip on the server
[07:44:00] <tw2113> Grundell, i think that'd be more a server method
[07:44:11] <Cork> Grundell: you don't gzip it manually
[07:44:20] <evenicoulddoit> Hi all, I'm upgrading my jQuery UI (and jQuery) - using Migrate which is really good BTW. I'm having trouble with my jQuery UI though because we've been using tabsTemplate which I think is depreciated. The demo here seems to suggest otherwise however: http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation - I think it just needs removing
[07:44:21] <StephenS> what is the best to send and get output? xmlhttp request or to use ajax?
[07:44:28] <Grundell> tw2113: / Cork: ahh okay, thanks
[07:44:47] <StephenS> for live search I currently use window.XMLHttpRequest()
[07:45:09] <Cork> Grundell: ex. http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_deflate.html
[07:45:20] <Grundell> Cork: Merci
[07:45:38] <Cork> StephenS: $.ajax is a compatibility wrapper for XMLHttpRequest
[07:45:45] <Cork> so just use $.ajax
[07:46:02] <ezrafree> dcherman: i tried this but it doesn't work: if (/\./g.test( invputVal )) {
[07:46:27] <BillCriswell> How do you guys store javascript templates? <script>, <div>, separate file, js variable?
[07:47:27] <Cork> ezrafree: define "doesn't work"
[07:47:29] <ezrafree> ah i need to save that regex to an object first
[07:47:36] <Cork> no
[07:47:49] <Cork> ?eval /\./g.test('srhk.sdkfjh')
[07:47:49] <ezrafree> Cork: gladly, it doesn't remove the attribute from the checkbox input as it should.
[07:47:52] <bot-t> Cork: true
[07:48:22] <Cork> ezrafree: check what each code does instead if the entire section works
[07:48:34] <Cork> else you will have problem finding the cause
[07:48:35] <ezrafree> Cork: so you're saying this should work: if(?eval /\./g.test('srhk.sdkfjh')) {}
[07:48:43] <Cork> uh... no
[07:49:02] <ezrafree> Cork: as you can see in the jsfiddle i've been console logging the variables as i go
[07:49:04] <Cork> bot-t reacts to ?eval thats why its there
[07:49:11] <StephenS> Cork, ok and how can I manipulate with search box, when someone click thing outside of input text box, to remove (hide) live box..?
[07:49:14] <ezrafree> Cork: ah ok thanks
[07:49:15] <StephenS> mouseover events?
[07:49:19] <StephenS> ?mouseevent
[07:49:25] <StephenS> ?mouseover
[07:49:39] <bot-t> StephenS, Mouse Events | jQuery API Documentation - Bind an event handler to the click JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/category/events/mouse-events/

[07:49:59] <Cork> StephenS: please don't kill bot-t its a bit slow
[07:50:26] <Cork> ezrafree: ah, i missed that link
[07:51:21] <ezrafree> yeah that test() method isn't working out for me either: http://jsfiddle.net/UCEQv/1/
[07:51:51] <Cork> ezrafree: http://jsfiddle.net/UCEQv/2/
[07:52:01] <Cork> the problem is that you used prop('value')
[07:52:15] <Cork> also don't mix removeAttr and prop
[07:52:27] <Cork> and prop takes true/false for checked, not a string
[07:53:05] <ezrafree> Cork: that's not the expeected behavior. it is supposed to only uncheck the checkbox if there are two or more "periods" in the entered text
[07:53:23] <Cork> ah, then test won't work
[07:53:31] <ezrafree> Cork: thank you though, the above info about mixing prop/removeAttr is helpful
[07:53:36] <Grundell> Cork: should it be enough if i add the AddOutputFilterByType: in .htaccess or do i need to sign on to the appache server and do it ?
[07:54:13] <Cork> ezrafree: http://jsfiddle.net/UCEQv/3/
[07:54:41] <Cork> Grundell: yes, you can enable gzip in htaccess
[07:55:00] <Grundell> Cork: thanks
[07:55:29] <ezrafree> Cork: did you try typing in the input to test? it unchecks the checkbox as soon as you type
[07:56:00] <Cork> ah wait it should go the other way around
[07:56:06] <ezrafree> yeah i see it too
[07:56:18] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/UCEQv/5/
[07:56:18] <ezrafree> http://jsfiddle.net/UCEQv/6/
[07:56:22] <ezrafree> hehe
[07:56:46] <Cork> you need to remove the if case too
[07:56:55] <ezrafree> ahhh
[07:57:02] <ezrafree> yeah yours on /5/ works
[07:57:12] <Cork> and ([] || inputVal.match(/\./g)) will give the wrong effect
[07:57:25] <Cork> i needs to be (inputVal.match(/\./g) || [])
[07:57:49] <Cork> ?eval [] || []
[07:57:50] <bot-t> Cork: []
[07:57:54] <Cork> ?eval null || []
[07:57:55] <bot-t> Cork: []
[07:58:00] <Cork> ?eval [] || [1,2,3]
[07:58:01] <bot-t> Cork: []
[07:58:08] <Cork> ?eval [1,2,3] || []
[07:58:09] <bot-t> Cork: [1, 2, 3]
[07:58:32] <Cork> so you will never get more then 0 with your change
[07:58:40] <StephenS> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/MLB2A/ this works fine, however onclick inside livesearch box, I dont get redirected to link, but only hidden box.. what Im missing?
[07:59:21] <ezrafree> Cork: thanks! it works when i put it into my app now too
[07:59:24] <Cork> StephenS: why are you doing all the compatibility work again, when its already in jquery?!?
[08:00:13] <StephenS> you mean with $.ajax()?
[08:00:17] <StephenS> I mean $.GET
[08:00:30] <StephenS> because Im not sure how to send data with get
[08:01:30] <Cork> StephenS: http://jsfiddle.net/MLB2A/1/

[08:02:09] <omani_> I try to get data like: var data = [ [1364... , 2]. [....] ]
[08:02:46] <StephenS> Cork, and what is trigger for form input text?
[08:02:49] <StephenS> id="livesearch" ?
[08:03:09] <StephenS> I used onkeyup="showResult(this.value)"
[08:03:36] <StephenS> however, id for search input field is already searchinput
[08:03:49] <Cork> StephenS: you have no form handing in your code
[08:03:58] <StephenS> You mean on jsfiddle?
[08:04:09] <Cork> ues

[08:09:46] <aro> is there a way to append an element right inside a tag?
[08:09:58] <StephenS> Well yes it works now, but it works like it used to work with my own code.

[08:10:59] <aro> thanks
[08:11:07] <Cork> StephenS: why sould focusout trigger a page reload?
[08:12:12] <StephenS> Cork: it should not, it should hide search box when clicked outside of input field, however I dont want to hide box when clicked inside box
[08:13:10] <StephenS> is there a way to one dom element not be affected with that?
[08:13:36] <StephenS> $("#searchinput").focusout(function() { $("#livesearch").hide(); //if is inside livesearch do not focusout box.. });
[08:15:13] <Cork> StephenS: is serachinput static on the page; or is it added through the ajax call?
[08:15:19] <StephenS> static
[08:17:31] <Cork> StephenS: http://jsfiddle.net/MLB2A/6/

[08:18:43] <anew> good question
[08:18:52] <Cork> StephenS: its so it can be tested on jsfiddle
[08:19:09] <Cork> you will have to change it to your local url
[08:19:30] <StephenS> not working..
[08:19:44] <jedimind> i have a video asset that's hosted on another domain
[08:19:45] <Cork> ok, then you need to make a full example in jsfiddle
[08:19:52] <Cork> one where the needed parts exists
[08:19:55] <StephenS> Work particular

[08:31:22] <jackw411> :(
[08:31:55] <omani_> TypeError: a is null in jquery.min.js
[08:32:00] <omani_> when I use jQuery.each()
[08:32:03] <omani_> is this a bug?
[08:33:34] <M4d3L-Rabbit> the one coming with jquery.ui
[08:33:42] <Cork> omani_: no, its that you give it something that is not expected
[08:33:56] <Cork> omani_: also you shouldn't develop with a minimized version of jquery
[08:34:19] <omani_> see http://paste.scsys.co.uk/237376?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[08:34:27] <omani_> these are the params I pass to the function
[08:34:36] <omani_> but the function content is different now
[08:34:38] <omani_> nopaste is old
[08:35:03] <omani_> here is current function
[08:35:04] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/237382?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[08:35:24] <Cork> omani_: you reset data each itteration
[08:35:28] <Cork> use .push()
[08:37:03] <omani_> I use push no
[08:37:04] <omani_> w
[08:37:07] <omani_> but still same error
[08:37:16] <omani_> data.push(ticks.value, days.value);
[08:37:22] <Cork> no
[08:37:30] <Cork> data.push([value, value])
[08:37:51] <NoiseEee> dun forget to get up data as an array first
[08:38:03] <omani_> still same error
[08:38:10] <omani_> NoiseEee: yes fixed that.
[08:38:17] <omani_> data = [];
[08:38:30] <omani_> var data = [];
[08:38:44] <NoiseEee> omani_: jsfiddle please.
[08:40:11] <omani_> http://jsfiddle.net/3L4GE/
[08:40:38] <NoiseEee1> omani_: no, with both 'ticks' and 'days' as they are
[08:40:49] <NoiseEee1> omani_: who knows if your .parseJSON is giving you what you think it is?
[08:40:53] <NoiseEee1> basic debugging plz
[08:41:08] <omani_> ticks and days are this
[08:41:16] <NoiseEee1> ...
[08:41:16] <M4d3L-Rabbit> how do I get the autocomplete data from blur event?
[08:41:17] <omani_> the params are the one I pass to the function
[08:41:34] <NoiseEee1> good luck omani_ :)
[08:41:34] <dobalina> anyone know how i can wrap this in a jquery function or something that would prevent the the click() from being continuously executed after it is clicked once?
[08:41:42] <dobalina> or have it an on or off type state...
[08:41:52] <omani_> ? :/

[08:46:29] <omani_> I don't get this.
[08:46:44] <omani_> I don't get jsfiddle.
[08:47:07] <omani_> 'p'.text("hello") even doesn't work
[08:47:13] <omani_> how do I print out something?
[08:47:39] <Cork> $('p').text('hello');
[08:48:11] <omani_> no
[08:48:13] <omani_> doesn't work
[08:48:15] <omani_> see jsfiddle
[08:48:26] <omani_> http://jsfiddle.net/3L4GE/4/
[08:48:34] <omani_> jsfiddle is broken
[08:48:40] <NoiseEee> omani_: its amazing how many things are broken for you
[08:48:54] <NoiseEee> omani_: you're a great bug finder
[08:48:58] <fabioportieri> hi
[08:49:03] <omani_> NoiseEee: well that was rather a joke than..
[08:49:04] <omani_> you know.
[08:49:05] <NoiseEee> omani_: i will stop my sarcasm as soon as you might possibly thing YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG
[08:49:09] <aro> i am trying to show/hide a div when the user mouseovers a container div. is there a way to prevent it from showing/hidng repeatedly?
[08:49:10] <fabioportieri> is bad practice to have multiple document.ready statements?
[08:49:29] <omani_> NoiseEee: I'm really trying to get this to work
[08:49:40] <omani_> and now I'm spending time to get jsfiddle working
[08:49:41] <omani_> I mean
[08:49:49] <omani_> I would like to continue to code on my own stuff
[08:50:09] <omani_> but rather have to "waste" time on jsfiddle just to be able to show you my code.
[08:50:13] <omani_> I mean. sup?
[08:51:03] <omani_> I gave you the jsfiddle link. why don't you guys (who are pros obvoiously) just edit my jsfiddle the correct way
[08:51:13] <omani_> if you all know how to jsfiddle' something.
[08:51:32] <Cork> omani_: http://jsfiddle.net/3L4GE/5/
[08:51:32] <pachet> some of us have to jsfiddle ourselves a salary
[08:51:54] <Cork> omani_: no its just your code that was really broken
[08:52:03] <Cork> so it never ran
[08:52:19] <omani_> thanks
[08:52:44] <Cork> omani_: http://jsfiddle.net/3L4GE/7/
[08:53:34] <omani_> nice
[08:53:41] <omani_> now this is what I call pro coding :)
[08:54:56] <MaximusColourum> what in the heck is $('All').value  trying  to access?
[08:55:11] <MaximusColourum> Not an ID or class selector
[08:55:23] <MaximusColourum> an element named all?
[08:56:17] <MaximusColourum> Should that not be $('#All') if it is trying to access an option w/ id="All"
[08:56:34] <Cork> MaximusColourum: would be an invalid selector
[08:56:39] <Cork> it would try to select <all>
[08:56:46] <MaximusColourum> hmmm
[08:56:54] <Cork> though .value makes me thing thats not jquery
[08:57:11] <MaximusColourum> ah, prototype maybe
[08:57:17] <MaximusColourum> this site has both mixed together
[08:57:37] <M4d3L-Rabbit> how do I throw manually the autocomplete to trigger the source?
[08:58:41] <Cork> omani_: http://jsfiddle.net/3L4GE/9/
[08:58:49] <shmoon> how do you select first 10 children of a parent?
[08:59:09] <Cork> ?.slice @ shmoon
[08:59:09] <bot-t> shmoon, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[08:59:14] <shmoon> hehe thanks
[09:00:08] <shmoon> Cork: they will give me JS objects though not jquery ones right ?
[09:00:18] <shmoon> $('level').slice(0,10)
[09:00:29] <shmoon> $('.level').slice(0,10)
[09:00:48] <Cork> shmoon: nope
[09:01:00] <Cork> you will get a jquery object back
[09:01:19] <Cork> (read the documentation i linked though *ehum*)
[09:01:55] <shmoon> oh sorry so this is a jquery slice implementation
[09:06:02] <okdamn> hey how do i check if element with class .row exists in the dom?
[09:07:06] <deepy> select it and see if you get any result
[09:08:21] <okdamn> how to check results sorry?
[09:08:31] <okdamn> i need a condition if(element exists){}
[09:28:44] <rocky> so... i need to chain ajax requests and the results i'm finding on google so far are all very complicated... i don't suppose there's a jquery plugin some where for this?
[09:32:48] <Andrew_R> rocky: maybe you can use async = false in your ajax requests?
[09:34:45] <Mr_Grim> hey guys
[09:35:24] <Mr_Grim> i have am drawing a circle around a character and for some reason the css does not retain properly when i create a new table row. any suggestions? i have my example up on pastebin
[09:35:27] <Mr_Grim> http://pastebin.com/xTpZWHfP
[09:35:50] <Mr_Grim> the class is called: table_number
[09:39:33] <didiergm> hey guys - I am confused about dynamic page generation in jqm and the use of pagebeforechange
[09:39:49] <Andrew_R> Mr_Grim: on initial load, you have <td><div class="table_number" id="numeric_index_0">0</div></td>
[09:40:11] <Andrew_R> on the rows after you add more rows you have <td class="table_number">1</td>
[09:40:25] <didiergm> e.g. I have a menu which depends on who logs in so from the login dialog, I get the menu content as json and want to generate a new page with a listview
[09:40:45] <koskoz> hi
[09:40:50] <Jester86> hey
[09:41:02] <NotsoFreeman> Whenever I use .prepend in IE it only renders the closing tag, if the text has nothing around it EX 'Test' it shows up, but if it is '<div>Test</div>' it only renders the '</div>' in the DOM.  any ideas?
[09:41:04] <didiergm> Could anyone shed some light or point me to a good read ?
[09:41:12] <Jester86> Man I'm drinking Pepsi for the first time in a long time.. it tastes like shit
[09:41:29] <Jester86> didiergm what kind of read?
[09:41:45] <koskoz> I'm using .text() to get the text of a link, but this text contains html. With .text() the html is not present but I've got lot of whitespaces and line breaks inside it. Except using native js function to work with that there's nothing jquery can do about it to help me?
[09:42:09] <Jester86> the kind of read where you sit in a movie theater and watch and listen to the screen play being read and demonstrated to you?
[09:42:20] <didiergm> Jester86 something about jquery mobile & dynamic page generation from json data - I am confused about navigation/pagebeforechange etc..
[09:43:02] <didiergm> Jester86 the kind of read which explains someting to me :)
[09:43:47] <Mr_Grim> Andrew_R yes correct
[09:43:54] <Mr_Grim> but the circle does not retain its shape on the next table row
[09:44:02] <Jester86> didiergm if you find a good read for that please let me know ;)
[09:44:26] <didiergm> will do anyone else has an idea ?
[09:45:28] <Andrew_R> Mr_Grim: it's because your HTML doesn't match. Fix your addTableRows() function so it makes the same HTML as you have initially
[09:45:55] <Mr_Grim> hmm okay
[09:45:56] <Mr_Grim> sec
[09:47:38] <Mr_Grim> Andrew_R hmm that works
[09:48:10] <Mr_Grim> Andrew_R why does the css not retain when I increment the number?
[09:48:12] <Mr_Grim> whats the deal?
[09:48:15] <shoky> Mr_Grim: no need for all that [0] stuff...  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/AwwHf/1/
[09:48:42] <Mr_Grim> i am also trying to change the id numbers as well
[09:49:17] <Mr_Grim> ahh
[09:49:20] <Mr_Grim> !##$% awesome
[09:50:16] <Mr_Grim> shoky what would be the correct way to change the id numbers for each element?
[09:50:57] <shoky> Mr_Grim: the correct way would probably be to use classes instead, and not increment anything
[09:51:09] <shoky> class="numeric_index"
[09:51:36] <shoky> well, increment only the visible row number ;p
[09:51:39] <Mr_Grim> ahh yeah
[09:51:42] <Mr_Grim> you know whay
[09:51:43] <Mr_Grim> what
[09:51:46] <Mr_Grim> that is a better idea
[09:53:38] <rich97> Hey. Does anyone know why $(document).ready(); would not be firing on an ipad but a $(window).load(); would? I'm using jQuery 1.4.2
[09:55:07] <Zzaichik> stone age jQuery
[09:55:26] <rich97> Zzaichik: No choice :(
[09:55:44] <Zzaichik> sorry man.  and I'm not sure why either.
[09:57:11] <didiergm> rich97 using jquerymobile ?
[09:57:26] <didiergm> or straight jquery
[09:57:38] <rich97> didiergm: No. Just the standard jQuery library. Debugging a legacy thing.
[09:58:59] <didiergm> which browser ? which ios ?
[09:59:00] <didiergm> @rich97
[09:59:29] <rich97> didiergm: chrome AND safari on iOs
[10:01:03] <didiergm> rich97 on older ipad (Ipad 1) had trouble with safari; have you tried to load it on chrome desktop and ensure no syntax error (assuming the app does  apply trick to safari)
[10:01:36] <didiergm> rich97 because document.ready being the core of jq should still work
[10:02:15] <didiergm> rich97 you could try to move the content of .ready() to the bottom of your html
[10:04:02] <goddard> if I put inputs into a form via ajax how can i serialize a form with them in them?
[10:04:19] <goddard> it isn't find the inputs that are loaded via ajax for some reason
[10:04:40] <rich97> didiergm: No syntax errors. Theres a 404 of an image but that's it. And the script is right above the </body> tag...
[10:04:56] <rich97> just seems strange that window load will wory but not document ready
[10:05:26] <rich97> goddard: which jQuery version are you using?
[10:05:34] <didiergm> rich97. hmmmm care to show bit of it on a fiddle ?
[10:06:16] <rich97> didiergm: I can do better than that: http://www.upad.co.uk/rpm1
[10:06:20] <didiergm> goddard do your input have names & ids
[10:06:22] <rich97> it's in address.js
[10:07:21] <rich97> didiergm: crap I forgot it was compressed on live
[10:07:44] <goddard> its version 1.7.2 i think
[10:08:53] <rich97> didiergm: sorry I cant show you the uncompressed code. but it's as simple as $(document).ready(function() {alert('called')}) // this doesn't work
[10:10:10] <didiergm> rich97 you seem to have a frame (rpm1) which get an error 500 on load
[10:10:54] <didiergm> rich97 - I wonder if it is not loading jqeury after jquery ui. at least in the frame
[10:11:31] <rich97> didiergm: well the funny thing is I'm not seeing any 500 errors
[10:11:39] <rich97> only a 404
[10:12:00] <didiergm> rich97 did you write it yourself ?
[10:12:02] <M4d3L-Rabbit> how do I trigger manually the autocomplete to trigger the source?
[10:12:09] <WHTM> I'm trying to implement touch events in a web app on iOS where you can scroll without triggering a touchstart/end, but iOS 6 doesn't seem to be registering .click  or .bind('touchstart', function{â€¦ This is what I have currently and I can't see why it doesn't work, could someone take a look please http://jsfiddle.net/Mzb3C/
[10:12:11] <rich97> didiergm: Hell no :P
[10:12:28] <didiergm> rich97 - so you light live another day :)
[10:12:40] <didiergm> rich97 s/light/might/
[10:13:09] <rich97> didiergm: First it was by russins, then indians, then students and now it's in house.
[10:13:31] <didiergm> rich97 - in house ? file for divorce !!!!!
[10:13:31] <rich97> we are slowly clearing up the mess
[10:13:54] <rich97> lol
[10:14:45] <rich97> didiergm: we are going to throw this code out sometime but it's mission ciritcal so it's not going to happen any time soon.
[10:15:00] <pachet> >'mission critical'
[10:15:01] <pachet> >'students'
[10:15:10] <didiergm> rich97 - I definitively have a 500 on an element T in the frame.
[10:15:17] <rich97> pachet: I'm fully aware i suck at typing thank you
[10:15:19] <didiergm> pachet - yeah ! (sigh)
[10:16:03] <pachet> rich97: it wasn't your typing under critique
[10:16:06] <didiergm> rich97 - I believe pachet was referring to the collision between "mission critical " & "students"
[10:16:16] <didiergm> rich97 anyway
[10:16:39] <rich97> didiergm: oh yeah I'm getting the 500 now
[10:16:43] <didiergm> rich97 you sure jqui 1.8.4 plays nicely with jq 1.4 ?
[10:17:30] <didiergm> rich97 first thing I would do : move all the script thingies into the head section so that you control - at least better the order things do happen
[10:17:53] <didiergm> rich97 I'd remove all the google analytics crap for a wee while whilst you debug the junk
[10:18:22] <rich97> didiergm: The tracking crap doesn't happen on dev.
[10:19:13] <didiergm> rich97 yeas but the scripts are loaded
[10:20:05] <didiergm> rich97 I could be wrong - but it smells (to me) as things not happening at the right time.
[10:20:32] <rich97> didiergm: no they aren't. the scripts dont get put out to the templates on dev.
[10:20:50] <rich97> didiergm: I'm inclied to agree. Let me just switch the JS to the head.
[10:21:10] <rich97> (the tracking scripts)
[10:23:09] <affuuff> im trying to write to div the stuff i load from file, but I want to add <br> with .replace. I can load it to div with this $('#result').load('ihmiset.txt'); but this wont do the trick: $('#result').load('ihmiset.txt', function(data); { var ihmiset = data.replace ("\n", "<br>"); document.write(('#result').ihmiset); or document.result.innerHTML = ihmiset; result is the id of the div
[10:24:39] <rich97> didiergm: Thanks for your help, but moving it didn't solve the iPads woes
[10:25:09] <affuuff> hrmm that last one doesn't make sense
[10:25:15] <rich97> Probably an error I can't see because chrome for ipad doesn't have a console :/
[10:25:18] <rich97> to my knowledge
[10:25:34] <affuuff> i guess
[10:26:10] <Mr_Grim> shoky are you still there? I have some code which unfortunatly depends on having id's in place
[10:26:18] <Mr_Grim> i need to update id's
[10:27:13] <didiergm> rich97 keep digging in that direction - if you look on chrome desktop @ the ressources on the frame - scripts seem to be out of order (ie jquery appears after jquery mobile ???)
[10:27:42] <didiergm> rich97 could it be that jq is loaded twice ?
[10:28:16] <didiergm> rich97 have you had it ever working on ipad ?
[10:28:22] <rich97> didiergm: no
[10:28:39] <rich97> customers are starting to bring it up so I though I'd look into it
[10:28:45] <didiergm> rich97 sure that jq that old actuially works on ipad ?
[10:28:55] <rich97> for the most part yes
[10:29:04] <rich97> other Js on the site works
[10:29:14] <rich97> all using document ready
[10:29:35] <Corrado> I have a button inside a form with an onclick event ... when I can clicci this button to obtain the id of the form that contains it?
[10:29:35] <didiergm> rich97 so THAT page / frame is the trouble.
[10:30:18] <rich97> didiergm: as far as I can tell. tomorrow morining I'm going to strip out all of the unrelated stuff I can
[10:30:56] <NoiseEee> Corrado: whenever you want?
[10:31:05] <didiergm> rich97 a idle thought the document.ready stuff is it in the main or frame ?
[10:31:30] <rich97> didiergm: main
[10:31:38] <rich97> the frame is just tracking stuff
[10:31:47] <rich97> mercenta to be exact
[10:31:58] <didiergm> rich97 'coz there is also one in the frame ....
[10:32:14] <Corrado> i have onclick="foo()" and in foo i want retrive id of my form, muy button is inside the form
[10:32:17] <rich97> which frame?
[10:34:33] <didiergm> rich97 - you're in the uk ? email me you landline if you want we can have a 5' chat. didiergm at gmail dot com
[10:34:36] <affuuff> im trying to write to div the stuff i load from file, but I want to add <br> with .replace. I can load it to div without adding <br> with this $('#result').load('ihmiset.txt'); but for adding <br> this wont do the trick: $('#result').load('ihmiset.txt', function(data); { var ihmiset = data.replace ("\n", "<br>"); document.result.innerHTML = ihmiset; instead it just shows blank on the div. "result" is the id of the div
[10:35:15] <rich97> didiergm: Sure
[10:39:01] <didiergm> rich97 did not get anything. going outside for a quick fag
[10:43:19] <mauke> o hai
[10:48:32] <omani_> do I have to call a function with an array as parameters in double quotes?
[10:48:45] <omani_> to iterate through it with jQuery.each()?
[10:48:49] <omani_> TypeError: a is undefined
[10:48:53] <omani_> is what I get
[10:49:00] <omani_> in jquery....min.js
[10:49:34] <gvo> I have a grid that is in a fieldset within a tab container.  FF displays it fine, Chrome on Centos displays it fine, but Chrome Version 25.0.1364.160 causes the fieldset width to be too small and forces the grid to display a horizontal scrollbar
[10:52:21] <eddiemonge> gvo: thats more of a css issue
[10:52:31] <eddiemonge> but do you have example code anyway?
[10:52:44] <gvo> I took out every css one at a time with no change.
[10:52:45] <eddiemonge> omani_: ? example?
[10:53:02] <eddiemonge> gvo: still css. css determines how something is displayed.
[10:53:03] <gvo> eddiemonge: It's too big for an example.
[10:53:14] <eddiemonge> then actual page?
[10:53:38] <gvo> eddiemonge: I know.  I even drilled down in the debugger and can't find where it's being restrained.
[10:54:06] <gvo> eddiemonge: It has sensitive data.  It's an accounting form for my club.
[10:55:15] <gvo> eddiemonge: This just started happening.  I suspect a new version of Chrome did it.
[10:55:50] <gvo> FF works, old chrome works.  IE doesn't work but never has, surprise surprise.  IE never works on anything I write.
[10:56:06] <eddiemonge> gvo: what are you asking for then if you arent providing anything to help us help you?
[10:57:14] <gvo> Just hoping someone would recognize the problem.
[10:57:18] <hugo_moss> how can i debug a modal popup in internet explorer 9?
[11:02:36] <eddiemonge> use its developer tools? F12
[11:04:21] <dotnetted> Hey all - when using $.proxy while binding to a click event how can I pass the event through to the proxied method? http://jsfiddle.net/s6ZVP/
[11:05:06] <dotnetted> ( I need to e.preventDefault() in foo() )
[11:05:28] <hugo_moss> eddiemonge: when i press f12, the modal popup(im using fancybox), i cant inspect the popup with the white arrow inspector. it doesn't do anything, also i can't find the updates in the dom tree with the popup
[11:07:06] <M4d3L-Rabbit> in autocomplete  change: function (event, ui) {} how do I make autocomplete to call data source?
[11:07:06] <hugo_moss> oh it worked now
[11:07:08] <hugo_moss> i hit refresh
[11:08:30] <eddiemonge> M4d3L-Rabbit: have you looked at the demos?
[11:08:47] <eddiemonge> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote?
[11:10:02] <hugo_moss> im having a problem with fancybox in ie, i have a fixed position navbar at the top using bootstrap, when i click the fancybox popup link, once the popup loads its content, the fixed navbar disappears back to the top and is no longer fixed, when i hit f12, it is in ie9 standards mode, but the problem disappears
[11:11:58] <hugo_moss> actually, it disappears when i mouse over the popup content with my mouse
[11:16:57] <M4d3L-Rabbit> eddiemonge: found it finally $(this).data('ui-autocomplete').search()
[11:23:50] <M4d3L-Rabbit> inside autocomplete.widget().children(".ui-menu-item").each(function() {}  how do I get current item data?
[11:30:51] <M4d3L-Rabbit> all doc I found say $(this).data("item.ui-autocomplete"); but this return me undefined
[11:30:58] <yedi> so I have a $ wrapper for an elements called $w. I also have a selector that will match a bunch of elements including the one wrapped in $w. Is there a trivial way to select all elements except $w?
[11:31:31] <spobat> how can I select by html-content?
[11:31:48] <spobat> Id like to select the <li> with "jquery" as content> http://ideone.com/rs1NUV
[11:31:50] <yedi> i know i can put ids on the potential $w elements and then pull that id from $w and use not(), but I was hoping there'd be a simpler way
[11:32:49] <spobat> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2241826/jquery-get-all-links-with-inner-html-value
[11:36:29] <eddiemonge> M4d3L-Rabbit: what context is that in?
[11:36:44] <eddiemonge> `not @ yedi
[11:36:51] <eddiemonge> ?not @ yedi
[11:36:52] <bot-t> yedi, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[11:37:10] <eddiemonge> ?contains @ spobat
[11:37:11] <bot-t> spobat, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:37:11] <yedi> can i use .not with just a jquery element
[11:37:24] <eddiemonge> yedi: yes
[11:37:43] <spobat> right
[11:43:28] <Onkeltem> I have a list with images, each having "width" and "height" attributes set and I need to know the height of the list, but I get small values like there is no images loaded. Any ideas?
[11:43:55] <M4d3L-Rabbit> eddiemonge: when someone wrote fast a username than use tab, the request doesnt have to finish and doesnt throw propper error if the username wrote is not good.
[11:43:57] <Andrew_R> Onkeltem: are your images floated?
[11:44:45] <M4d3L-Rabbit> so in method change I need to validate if the wrote value match any item from autocomplete source
[11:45:05] <eddiemonge> or positioned absolutely?
[11:45:06] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: no, they have: max-width: 100%; height: auto
[11:45:56] <Mr_Grim> hey any reasony why my table is mangled when i try to clone a row but unhide the first row?
[11:45:57] <Mr_Grim> http://jsfiddle.net/AwwHf/2/
[11:46:06] <Andrew_R> Onkeltem: is there a link you can share?
[11:46:25] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: I'll try... need some time
[11:46:28] <Mr_Grim> i also need to increment the id's
[11:48:00] <eddiemonge> M4d3L-Rabbit: sounds like you need to use combobox then
[11:48:03] <omani_> could someone have a look at this please?
[11:48:04] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/237395?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[11:48:17] <omani_> my charts doesn't show me the values on the yxaxis
[11:48:23] <omani_> what could be the reason?
[11:48:38] <omani_> I think something with tick is wrong.
[11:49:05] <spobat> what does $. ?
[11:49:10] <spobat> $.get() for examlpe
[11:49:10] <omani_> jquery
[11:49:36] <spobat> what?
[11:49:38] <Andrew_R> Mr_Grim: use .show() instead of .css('display', 'inline')
[11:50:00] <omani_> spobat: $. stands for jQuery()
[11:50:10] <spobat> alright, thank you
[11:51:19] <Mr_Grim> Andrew_R thank you
[11:51:28] <hugo_moss> got it fancybox was adding a doctype of html4
[11:53:01] <omani_> any advice?
[11:53:04] <omani_> to my nopaste?
[11:53:15] <Andrew_R> Mr_Grim: I think trows.show() will be fine in your code, no reason to do $(trows[0]).show()
[11:54:05] <Andrew_R> for your other question, right before trows.show(), add a line like $('> div', trows).id('numeric_index_' + rowNumber);
[11:55:20] <Andrew_R> err... attr('id', 'numeric_index_' + rowNumber)
[11:56:28] <Andrew_R> Mr_Grim: http://jsfiddle.net/AwwHf/7/
[11:58:50] <sebumd> hi all, I'm using jQM and running into issues where it loads a page, then goes immediately to the previous page as if I typed window.location(-1); or something.  Is this the proper place to ask the question?  Can't figure out what I'm doing wrong!
[11:59:07] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: http://zf.neganov.ru/ - here is the link. Please open console. There you will see a line: "content.offset().top: 198 content.height(): 15 summ:213 ". The same piece of content is marked by red background â€” it's much higher then values reported in this line
[11:59:43] <eddiemonge> Mr_Grim: you also need to add var i instead of just i = 0 as your way is creating a global variable
[12:00:39] <zoidfarb> I need to make an AJAX request that will return a 301 redirect, but I want to be able to grab the URL that it redirects to. Does anyone know if/how it's possible to do that?
[12:01:05] <zoidfarb> it will be a cross-domain request, too
[12:01:36] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: as you can see, I placed the code which calculates content height into $(document).read(), hoping this will help. But it's not :(
[12:02:01] <mhill> Hey guys, I have an issue with jquery-ui dialogs
[12:02:06] <mhill> I am trying to run multiple instances of a jquery ui dialog on a single page.  Each dialog shows a similar page
[12:02:06] <mhill> with identical markup and css.  How can I distinguish one dialog's css selectors from the other?
[12:04:17] <Andrew_R> Onkeltem: I thought you said you wanted to calculate the height of the container the images are in, ie: .view-content, .view or .pane-content
[12:04:59] <M4d3L-Rabbit> how do I prevent menu to show from jquery autocomplete?
[12:06:05] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: yes, that's right. But 'views-row' is also the container. And I'd like to get it's height and position
[12:07:13] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: the code just takes last row (4th row in current setup) (which becomes red) and adds it's .offset().top to height().
[12:07:33] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: and I wonder why height = 15!
[12:08:34] <Andrew_R>      M content.offset().top: 564 content.height(): 198 summ:762 - M $(document).scrollTop(): 281$(window).height() 481 summ:762
[12:08:44] <Andrew_R> that's what I see in Firefox on the first two lines in the console
[12:09:49] <Onkeltem> Ohhh
[12:10:35] <Onkeltem> I'm in Chrome and my result is "M content.offset().top: 198 content.height(): 15 summ:213"
[12:11:31] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: I confirm â€” see what you said in FF
[12:12:15] <Andrew_R> what is "content"?
[12:14:14] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: in the first two lines (staring with "M") â€” it's actually what 'last' variable keeps. So on first page load it is exactly 4th .views-row
[12:14:51] <Onkeltem> (and it's the last row, until more rows is loaded via ajax)
[12:15:11] <eddiemonge> Mr_Grim: http://jsfiddle.net/AwwHf/8/ i modified everything. the html needs more mods.
[12:17:43] <merrihew> Is there a specific reason why .data(key) retrieves data from HTML5 data- attributes, but .data(key,value) doesn't set HTML5 data- attributes?
[12:18:29] <eddiemonge> merrihew: because it set jQuery data-attributes
[12:18:44] <eddiemonge> which if you are setting, you should also be retrieving with jquery
[12:18:50] <Andrew_R> Onkeltem: I think Chrome may be calculating the height before the image is loaded.
[12:19:01] <Andrew_R> even though you have height="198" it may be ignoring that
[12:19:02] <eddiemonge> to set the actual element then .prop('data-whatev' , val)
[12:19:13] <Andrew_R> what if you move this code to $(document).on('load', function) ?
[12:20:02] <merrihew> eddiemonge Right, I am just wondering why it only works in one direction?  I can use .data to get HTML5 attributes, but not set?  Just doesn't seem consistent.  I do realize you can use .prop or .attr to set HTML5 attributes.
[12:20:11] <awc737> how can I fire my own event in another script, based on one of these events? https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/js/foundation/foundation.magellan.js
[12:20:56] <eddiemonge> merrihew: because it converts the html data to javascript representations. faster
[12:21:27] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: it never even triggers
[12:22:36] <merrihew> eddiemonge OK, thanks.  Do you know if there is a way to search the DOM for data values set via .data(key,value) like you can for HTML5 data- attributes (like $("a[data-key='value']") )?
[12:22:37] <daslicht> hi
[12:22:39] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/jNqRx/#base
[12:22:52] <eddiemonge> awc737: ask zurb?
[12:22:57] <daslicht> I like to intercept all clikc outside the .bubble
[12:23:04] <daslicht> any suggestions how to solve this?
[12:23:43] <awc737> eddiemonge, is that like ask jeeves?
[12:23:53] <eddiemonge> merrihew: if you are setting them, you should already have them and know where they are
[12:24:06] <jezevec> Hi, I want to make invisible dialog. I have no idea where could be problem. Can be problem at this part of my code (http://pastebin.com/RSnaEN5G)? The error is: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dialog'   -- Thanks anybody for help
[12:24:07] <eddiemonge> awc737: no its like ask the people who make the product you are using
[12:24:27] <awc737> eddiemonge, its free open source they don't support it
[12:24:36] <awc737> I"m just asking how to override javascript events I guess
[12:24:42] <awc737> it shouldn't be specific to this product
[12:25:36] <eddiemonge> awc737: depends on the how they are set. you can sometimes extend them or unbind them and rebind them. its easier when you know how they are made to change them
[12:25:36] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: $(document).on('load', function() { .. } isn't triggered in FF too
[12:25:49] <eddiemonge> daslicht: you mean like click to show and then click outside to hide
[12:26:08] <daslicht> yeah
[12:26:09] <daslicht> :)
[12:26:11] <eddiemonge> jezevec: have you loaded jqueryui?
[12:26:15] <daslicht> yes
[12:26:19] <awc737> eddiemonge, its a very short script I linked, but basically I think the answer is this line:
[12:26:20] <awc737> $(this.scope).on('arrival.fndtn.magellan', '[data-magellan-arrival]', function (e) {
[12:26:34] <Andrew_R> Onkeltem: that probably has something to do with the Drupal.behaviors thing it's inside of, I'm afraid I don't know anything about that.
[12:26:50] <eddiemonge> awc737: ok then unbind that and set your own action, or add your handler to that?
[12:27:03] <Andrew_R> if you move your $(document).on('load', function) outside of that whole block and it should fire.
[12:27:13] <daslicht> i try it with event.target.nodeName
[12:27:15] <David_Park_SI_De> I'm doing a tutorial on Jquery and Idk what I'm doing wrong. http://pastebin.com/vjyQUGD4
[12:28:26] <jezevec> eddiemonge: yes, the latest jquery and jqueryui
[12:31:15] <daslicht> solution: http://jsfiddle.net/Py7Mu/
[12:32:35] <David_Park_SI_De> do i put my jQuery functions on a seperate .js file and link it to my html file? Or can I type it directly in?
[12:32:40] <MeXTuX> I have a group of radio options called "category" on change event I need to get the class of the selected radio button (each radio button has a different class and depending on the class I show or hide certain divs). It is something like this <input id="student" type="radio" name="category" value="student" class="student"><input id="employee" type="radio" name="category" value="employee" class="employee">
[12:34:26] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3518436/jquery-height-problem-with-chrome -- $(window).load() did the trick!
[12:35:21] <eddiemonge> jezevec: it didnt seem like jqui was laoded based off that error
[12:35:35] <Andrew_R> Onkeltem: cool :)
[12:37:31] <jezevec> eddiemonge: this is part of my head http://pastebin.com/pcfnhr6Q

[12:39:47] <eddiemonge> please tell me you have a build system that concates them?
[12:41:05] <eddiemonge> jezevec: does console show anything 404'ing or any other errors?

[12:44:38] <jezevec> eddiemonge: this is the only js problem
[12:44:57] <heru> by pressing the slider the website seem to refresh but without the slider
[12:45:20] <eddiemonge> jezevec: live link?
[12:45:52] <eddiemonge> daslicht: my solution could be a better but it binds and unbinds the click on document so it doesnt use up extra resources when it doesnt need to
[12:46:07] <eddiemonge> heru: that doesnt seem right
[12:47:09] <heru> wait, only if u click on the slide button
[12:47:33] <Onkeltem> Andrew_R: thank you for the help!
[12:47:56] <jezevec> eddiemonge: I have it only on my localhost. Every other js file is fine and working
[12:48:05] <sebumd> When I click on an internal page for the first time in jQM, it goes back to the previous page.  The second time it works fine, lol what should I look at?
[12:48:28] <eddiemonge> heru: is your markup the same as the examples?
[12:48:38] <daslicht> nice
[12:48:45] <heru> by clicking the sliderbutton without moving it
[12:50:29] <heru> i think so
[12:51:55] <Mr_Grim> is it possible to get a label tag based on the for value and change that for value?
[12:52:02] <Mr_Grim> if I can do that, I am all set.
[12:52:21] <mgifford> scott_gonzalez - we can try chatting here rather than twitter.  I hate IRC, but know it's useful.

[12:53:41] <jezevec> eddiemonge: I dont get it, but it seems like problem is with jqueryui.. I dont youse it at another part of my code..
[12:54:06] <eddiemonge> Mr_Grim: why would you want to?
[12:54:21] <eddiemonge> mgifford: you hate irc? why? i think its awesome
[12:54:44] <eddiemonge> jezevec: which version of jqui are you using? a custom build? does it have dialog in it?
[12:57:53] <heru> by removing href='#'in jquery.ui.slider.js the bug is gone
[12:57:58] <heru> can this be possible?
[12:58:51] <heru> line 76
[12:59:31] <eddiemonge> heru: your slider probably shouldnt be a link anyway
[13:02:50] <jezevec> eddiemonge: Yes
[13:03:05] <eddiemonge> jezevec: without an example its hard to help
[13:05:09] <jezevec> eddiemonge: Do you know django framework?

[13:37:44] <Mr_Grim> eddiemonge no
[13:37:48] <Mr_Grim> you just asked me why
[13:37:51] <Mr_Grim> thats all i saw before
[13:38:04] <eddiemonge> Mr_Grim: http://jsfiddle.net/AwwHf/8/ i modified everything. the html needs more mods.
[13:38:10] <Mr_Grim> oh awesome
[13:38:38] <eddiemonge> you dont need to use ids
[13:39:10] <Mr_Grim> oh awesome
[13:39:23] <Mr_Grim> eddiemonge i need id's
[13:39:30] <Mr_Grim> because of the widgets im using
[13:39:37] <Mr_Grim> someone wrote some code here that needs id's and labels
[13:39:45] <Mr_Grim> however i already have the id's incrementing
[13:39:52] <Mr_Grim> i just need to change the for reference on the label fields
[13:39:55] <Mr_Grim> and im done
[13:40:15] <Mr_Grim> ill need to refactor that code but i need to show something to my boss today
[13:40:22] <Mr_Grim> that's why ive been doing all of this other stuff
[13:40:29] <Mr_Grim> plus its good to know, i know jquery better

[13:42:23] <systemfault> guideX: Why would you do that?
[13:42:28] <eddiemonge> idr0p: like jqueryui? or dojo?
[13:42:38] <guideX> in safari only, a font doesn't render properly
[13:42:54] <eddiemonge> guideX: because safari renders font differently
[13:43:15] <guideX> I was thinking I could fall back to like arial or whatever when safari
[13:44:07] <Mr_Grim> ill refactor it later
[13:44:10] <Mr_Grim> for now i did: ('label[for="' +  attrval + '"]').attr('for',attrvalNew);
[13:44:27] <guideX> eddiemonge: do you have a better recommendation?
[13:44:35] <eddiemonge> guideX: does it look bad?
[13:44:41] <guideX> yeah only in safari
[13:44:44] <Mr_Grim> that line of code does not work though
[13:44:44] <guideX> looks terrible
[13:45:07] <systemfault> guideX: Where is the font coming from?
[13:45:16] <guideX> it's sitting on the filesystem on the webserver
[13:45:34] <guideX> the font is Swis721CnBTBold
[13:46:04] <systemfault> guideX: Did you use the fontsquirrel font-face generator to create a kit from the original font file?
[13:46:23] <guideX> hmm I did not, I will try that

[13:53:05] <initself> how do i basically map a button to a $(this) class?
[13:53:43] <eddiemonge> initself: is it near that element? can you do $(this).closest, next parent.find etc
[13:54:12] <initself> ah, yes maybe i can do it that way
[13:56:18] <brend_> anybody knows how im suppose to write .val(ui.item.id); in jquery ui 1.10 ?
[13:56:34] <brend_> i guess is using dashes now
[14:00:17] <eddiemonge> brend_: do you know what the difference between dashes and dots is in js?
[14:01:18] <brend_> eddiemonge:  im confuse with the upgrade.. cuz this worked in old versions.. not in the new one
[14:01:37] <eddiemonge> do you know what ui.item.id means?
[14:02:07] <brend_> eddiemonge:  is bringing up the id value of the json
[14:02:13] <Zzaichik> is it â€¦dashes are prettier?

[14:14:09] <RSDRSDRSD> for now it is working, but the logic isn;t as how a plugin should be
[14:14:13] <eddiemonge> DrMabuse: build the game secure?
[14:14:21] <RSDRSDRSD> the code is on http://pastebin.com/T33TnukV
[14:14:35] <RSDRSDRSD> can some one help me to write it the good wat
[14:15:17] <RSDRSDRSD> im struggling a long time
[14:15:31] <RSDRSDRSD> i first used mootools for most rojects
[14:15:42] <DrMabuse> @eddiemonge the most examples what i found was unsecured i look in my console the elements and found the id or image
[14:15:43] <RSDRSDRSD> but now i want to switch to jquery
[14:15:47] <JohnMcLear> hey guys, im trying to find a clean solution for getting the x offset of a character within a Div
[14:15:49] <brend_> nothing
[14:15:57] <JohnMcLear> I search about but found nothing great through search engines
[14:16:04] <JohnMcLear> anyone know of a clean solution that doesn't modify the dom?
[14:16:44] <masentinel900_> Guys!!
[14:16:50] <eddiemonge> DrMabuse: whatt are looking for then?
[14:17:08] <JohnMcLear> hrm

[14:17:16] <eddiemonge> brend_: what is next to the input?
[14:17:23] <Asterokid> Hello, Is it possible that innerHeight() returns wrong values even inside a $(document).ready callback?
[14:18:12] <eddiemonge> Asterokid: no. it returns the correct value. it may not be what you expect though
[14:18:29] <brend_> eddiemonge:  im getting Object[]
[14:18:44] <eddiemonge> brend_: inspect the dom
[14:18:46] <RSDRSDRSD> if I have 3 different elements (input, select and select) what is the best way to write a plugin, while interacting with all elements?
[14:19:37] <RSDRSDRSD> should i write 3 different plugins? and how to interact with the other elements
[14:20:18] <eddiemonge> RSDRSDRSD: are you talking about something like the datepicker in jqui?
[14:20:28] <Asterokid> EddieK: i am doing something pretty simple, it worked perfectly on macos until i tried on windows where the only solution seemed to add a timeout.
[14:20:40] <RSDRSDRSD> no
[14:20:44] <Asterokid> eddiemonge: i am doing something pretty simple, it worked perfectly on macos until i tried on windows where the only solution seemed to add a timeout.
[14:20:46] <Asterokid> :D
[14:21:00] <RSDRSDRSD> I have just 3 different elements and all 3 elements depend on each other
[14:21:06] <RSDRSDRSD> if one changes the other changes
[14:21:19] <RSDRSDRSD> how can I best rearange this in a plugin
[14:21:44] <eddiemonge> Asterokid: is there code somewhere?
[14:22:07] <eddiemonge> RSDRSDRSD: have you looked at the jqui datepicker with range?
[14:22:19] <RSDRSDRSD> not yet
[14:23:14] <RSDRSDRSD> that is one element
[14:25:04] <eddiemonge> RSDRSDRSD: looks like two to me
[14:25:22] <RSDRSDRSD> yes with range it is
[14:26:31] <eddiemonge> Asterokid: why arent you using jquery for that section?
[14:28:20] <brend_> eddiemonge:  i think i know what the problem is.. for some reason in this version the autocomplete creates a hidden span next to the input
[14:28:47] <eddiemonge> Asterokid: is it possible the resources havent loaded yet? you might need to do window.onload
[14:32:34] <Asterokid> eddiemonge: I can try using JQuery yeah... But is document.ready triggered after window.onLoad anyway?
[14:32:54] <eddiemonge> no.
[14:32:58] <eddiemonge> its when the dom is ready
[14:33:06] <eddiemonge> not when the resources are loaded and ready
[14:34:10] <Asterokid> Eddiemonge: how do you make sure you get window and document ready? Nested callbacks?
[14:34:12] <vernonk> Anyone know of a good reason not to load jQuery and jQuery Mobile at the bottom of the document rather than in the head?  The Anatomy article and such show it in the head and I wasn't sure with all of the auto-enhancement stuff that goes on whether it's necessary to include it in the head.
[14:34:54] <eddiemonge> $(window).on('load')
[14:34:56] <Asterokid> eddiemonge: how do you check for resource ready?
[14:35:59] <Asterokid> eddiemonge: so youd replace my $(document).ready for $(window).on('load')?
[14:36:25] <eddiemonge> Asterokid: your js should be at the bottom of the page as well
[14:37:01] <aaron1245> In jQuery Mobile, can panels be universal, or do I need to re-create the HTML for the panel in every page?  Seems like it should be able to be global as panels are typically used for navigation..
[14:37:36] <Asterokid> eddiemonge: could you enlight me on conventions? where should be the js and style includes?
[14:38:03] <Asterokid> eddiemonge: when you say bottom of the page you mean after </body> or after </html>?
[14:41:55] <admin_> hi folks im trying to make a login form using jquery ajax .... are they secure enough?
[14:42:30] <eddiemonge> secure enough for what?
[14:42:47] <DrMabuse> https
[14:43:01] <eddiemonge> you know ajax uses https connections right?
[14:43:04] <vernonk> aaron1245 I don't think you can do a persistent panel.
[14:43:07] <admin_> dont got HTTPS :( my provider wants $25 to set it up ...
[14:43:15] <admin_> well for SSL
[14:43:40] <aaron1245> @vernonk thanks, they should probably add that.  Thought that was sort of a given.
[14:44:35] <eddiemonge> admin_: then how do you expect it to be as secure as the thing its not going to use? ajax uses whichever protocol you tell it
[14:44:47] <vernonk> aaron1245 sure thing. You would need the ability to use a hi-state-persist type class to tie it together between page transitions.  The hard part is that those are keyed off of the ID set up (actual ID not data-id) and as pages are built and injected into the DOM you'd end up with more than a single ID.
[14:45:17] <vernonk> aaron1245 I see what you mean.  Especially considering the use of that for a possibly navigation pattern.
[14:45:22] <aaron1245> @vernonk yeah, I think what I'll do as a bandaid is recreate the panel in every page
[14:45:24] <Lundy> :/ thats why im in here asking about it.... im not too sure about it
[14:46:34] <vernonk> @aaron1245 yeah, looks like unfortunately that's what you'll have to do.  Depending on how you're rendering your pages (if just static, it'll be more of a pain) but you could do some type of include.
[14:47:25] <eddiemonge> Lundy: do you know what ajax is?
[14:47:32] <aaron1245> @vernonk Yeah, this is for a Phonegap app so I can't do any sort of include, but the app is only around 5 pages, so it's not that huge of a deal, just wanted to come here to confirm that I wasn't missing something.
[14:47:38] <aaron1245> @vernonk thanks for your help.
[14:47:59] <vernonk> @aaron1245 makes sense.  Anytime.  Main reason I even jump on here.
[14:51:35] <Lundy> yes I do eddiemonge
[14:55:00] <YammYcoding> helloo guys! What's a good solution with ajax/jquery built-in, for making fast small cruds with php/mysql ?
[14:55:34] <eddiemonge> that
[14:56:19] <YammYcoding> what?
[14:56:47] <eddiemonge> what you said
[14:57:10] <YammYcoding> but this is not a solution per se :)
[14:57:16] <eddiemonge> yes it is
[14:57:42] <eddiemonge> ajax using jquerys built in methods to make fast smll crud operations to your backend
[14:57:46] <YammYcoding> i mean some framework or lib, that helps make fast cruds using jquery/php/mysql
[14:58:21] <YammYcoding> i'm tired of reinventing php cruds with form actions and stuff
[14:58:42] <bluevolcano> .
[14:58:46] <djQuery> ?jqueryform
[14:58:51] <bot-t> djQuery, Form | jQuery API Documentation - Selects all button elements and elements of type button. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/form-selectors/
[14:59:20] <djQuery> YammYcoding, between jquery form and having a standard in the back end you should be able to dynamicaly make all your inserts updates in the back end
[14:59:40] <djQuery> YammYcoding, I typicaly just test to see if I have an id and if I don't I do an insert
[15:00:00] <djQuery> YammYcoding, and the name of my form is the name of the table that the insert update delete happend in
[15:00:36] <YammYcoding> like. i have seen many sites with lots of javascript. no form actions and no refreshes. wonders what are people using for cruds nowadays
[15:00:56] <eddiemonge> YammYcoding: do you know the difference between front-end and back-end?
[15:01:02] <YammYcoding> sure
[15:01:21] <eddiemonge> front end is just sending data to the back-end. the BE then decides what to do with tthat info. all separate transactions
[15:01:35] <YammYcoding> but i'm old style. my js is from 1996, plain code.
[15:01:37] <djQuery> YammYcoding, they are just doing all that stuff backend
[15:01:39] <YammYcoding> php either.
[15:01:49] <YammYcoding> i need to modernize my code style
[15:02:06] <djQuery> YammYcoding, http://cakephp.org/
[15:02:09] <eddiemonge> eww
[15:02:35] <djQuery> YammYcoding, theres mvc frameworks or rails frameworks or if you realy wanna learn something new try node
[15:02:43] <YammYcoding> i have seen cake some years ago, but when i hit the database abstraction i got stuck
[15:02:48] <eddiemonge> http://www.laravel.com/
[15:03:14] <jcp_> i have a script (that i can't edit), which adds a div (#ake) to a page. I've tried to add another div by detecting if #ake has a length. However, I've found that I need to use settimeout with 500ms to get it to work. Is there a better way to determine that a script has loaded and executed?
[15:03:28] <eddiemonge> but again, theres FE and theres BE. they arent the same thing. the BE framework might deliver the FE code but not necessarily
[15:03:36] <YammYcoding> i wanted something lighter for quick cruds, datagrids with sortable columns
[15:04:15] <eddiemonge> jcp_: not really reliably. does it offer an onload or ready callback?
[15:04:54] <eddiemonge> YammYcoding: again, figure out each part individually. got your crud operatons in the BE with a simple exposed API methods then get your FE to talk to those methods
[15:05:40] <YammYcoding> this easy ui from topic, would it help me?
[15:05:46] <jcp_> eddiemonge:  hm, not sure the script is fairly long. It does output the ms it took to load in the console.
[15:06:11] <eddiemonge> will jquery help you? probably
[15:06:26] <eddiemonge> jcp_: look at the documentation for it
[15:06:35] <YammYcoding> i also found a jquery easy ui
[15:06:39] <jcp_> eddiemonge: yea, checking now.
[15:06:55] <eddiemonge> jquery easy ui? you mean jQueryUI?
[15:07:11] <YammYcoding> http://www.jeasyui.com/
[15:07:32] <YammYcoding> it claims its jquery-like
[15:08:32] <eddiemonge> YammYcoding: i think you need to learn the basics first
[15:09:10] <YammYcoding> where do i start with?
[15:09:51] <eddiemonge> like i said, get your BE done first. then you can start learning how to dynamically interact with it using ajax methods
[15:09:56] <djQuery> YammYcoding, all that seems to do is see if there are any items that have a class of easyu-datagrid for example and apply thier data grid to it
[15:10:13] <lenswipe> hey ugy
[15:10:15] <lenswipe> guys*
[15:10:26] <djQuery> l8tr
[15:10:41] <YammYcoding> like making ajax calls from jquery ?
[15:10:45] <lenswipe> can someone help me - I'm trying to pass an argument to the XHR constructor in jQuery and it seems not to be working
[15:11:08] <lenswipe> if i create an XHR object manually and pass the arguments it works but not when I use xhrFields{} in $.ajax or $.ajaxsetup
[15:11:20] <lenswipe> anyone got any ideas what I need to be doing?
[15:11:47] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: what are you trying to do and dont use xhr in your description
[15:12:08] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, It's for a firefox OS app - why shouldn't I use xhr in my description?
[15:12:25] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: im trying to understand your problem
[15:12:59] <Stew-a> lenswipe is trying to use $.ajax in a firefox application, and it needs mozSystem: true passed in the XHR constructor for the request to work
[15:14:03] <Stew-a> which i realise has XHR in the description of the problem, but it can't really be explained otherwise
[15:14:20] <eddiemonge> well that makes a lot more sense at least
[15:15:29] <eddiemonge> have you tried xhrFields: { mozSystem: true } ?
[15:15:52] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, yeah - I tried that and it didn't work
[15:16:04] <lenswipe> I wish I had more info but the Firefox debugger isn't particularly verbose
[15:16:53] <eddiemonge> what version of jquery are you using?
[15:16:58] <lenswipe> uh...lemme check
[15:17:07] <lenswipe> 1.9.1
[15:17:46] <eddiemonge> what happens?
[15:19:25] <lenswipe> the request just fails: jqXHR.status returns "0" and textStatus returns "error"
[15:19:47] <lenswipe> like I said - I wish I could be more helpful but firefox OS isn't particularly good at giving verbose error messages :/
[15:20:18] <eddiemonge> no idea then. sorry thats the limit of my helping with FFOS
[15:20:47] <lenswipe> it's more of a jquery question than an FFOS question
[15:20:49] <lenswipe> but ok
[15:21:08] <eddiemonge> where are you putting xhrFields?
[15:21:25] <lenswipe> i tried it in $.ajax() and $.ajaxSetup()
[15:22:00] <eddiemonge> i know you know better but can i see your code anyway just in case you made a mistake?
[15:23:39] <smftre> I'm building a web app and it's frontend is very js/jquery heavy, I am busy making it even heavier as of the latest version, the prev version called in html panels and then built on top of them, how can I organise js code to not call in html files for this?
[15:23:59] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, by all means - hold on
[15:24:02] <smftre> i'm fine with building the panels using js, but then I will end up with a massively bloated js file
[15:24:15] <smftre> how do you project organise a js app, basically
[15:24:22] <smftre> ^that's pretty much the question
[15:24:26] <eddiemonge> smftre: use templates? or use a framework like backbone, ember or angular?
[15:24:43] <smftre> do you guys recommend one over another?
[15:24:49] <snover> yes, because all of those solve the modularity problem
[15:24:50] <snover> oh wait
[15:25:01] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, http://pastebin.com/U9Z4JSc4
[15:25:42] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, this is what I'm trying to do: http://davidwalsh.name/forums/topic/firefox-os-systemxhr
[15:26:00] <snover> smftre: i recommend dojo for large client-side apps
[15:26:33] <smftre> perhaps this question is termed best as: what is the most commonly used js framework for jquery? :D
[15:26:39] <smftre> that should throw a storm!
[15:26:56] <snover> the answer to that is backbone, though itâ€™s only barely a â€œframeworkâ€
[15:27:18] <RandalSchwartz> I'm looking at using backbone for my jquery projects
[15:27:23] <eddiemonge> snover: isnt that a bit biased? im not saying you are wrong though
[15:27:28] <smftre> thanks guys, I will start there
[15:27:33] <RandalSchwartz> but I may be getting out of that altogether, and using Dart (language) instead
[15:27:34] <snover> eddiemonge: which part :)
[15:27:40] <RandalSchwartz> tired of javascripts limits :)
[15:27:56] <lenswipe> RandalSchwartz, quick question
[15:28:02] <RandalSchwartz> how quick? :)
[15:28:06] <lenswipe> about 2 seconds
[15:28:08] * RandalSchwartz grins
[15:28:08] <lenswipe> RandalSchwartz, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randal_L._Schwartz is this you?
[15:28:10] <eddiemonge> the dojo for everything part
[15:28:12] <RandalSchwartz> yes it is
[15:28:15] <lenswipe> cool :)
[15:28:21] <RandalSchwartz> well - it's a wikipedia page *about* me
[15:28:22] <lenswipe> RandalSchwartz, </question>
[15:28:28] <RandalSchwartz> it isn't literally *me* :)
[15:28:33] <lenswipe> I was more meaning are you the real randal schwartz
[15:28:37] <RandalSchwartz> yes.
[15:28:44] <snover> eddiemonge: i didnâ€™t say everything, i said large client-side apps :)
[15:28:44] <lenswipe> cool :)
[15:28:48] <RandalSchwartz> I host FLOSS Weekly.  I interviewed Resig for that show.
[15:28:52] <RandalSchwartz> that got me liking jq.
[15:28:55] <RandalSchwartz> so I started hanging out here.
[15:28:56] <smftre> haha
[15:28:57] <lenswipe> ah
[15:28:58] <eddiemonge> snover: it was implied
[15:29:12] <RandalSchwartz> when he said he really liked Perl, it cemented it
[15:29:18] <lenswipe> I was thinking I had heard of you before - a quick google search later and I find that wikipedia link
[15:29:20] <smftre> that's quite sad to hang out here :D
[15:29:27] <smftre> you shouldnt tell people that
[15:29:32] <snover> like implied by the part where i suggested a thing with the specific qualifier â€œfor large client-side appsâ€? :P
[15:29:55] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://twit.tv/floss55
[15:30:53] <coldhead> how dare you shamelessly self promote your podcast RandalSchwartz :P
[15:31:11] <RandalSchwartz> heh... who said I was shameless?
[15:31:13] <shalotelli> hi i have a really annoying bug in one of my projects
[15:31:24] <shalotelli> I'm working on a form builder
[15:31:34] <lenswipe> coldhead, to be fair - I did ask him if he was the real Randal Schwartz
[15:31:46] <lenswipe> (I probably spelld that wrong - sorry)
[15:31:55] <coldhead> and to be fair, i <3 randal and was only kidding
[15:31:57] <shalotelli> that creates a json style string based on the selected elements
[15:32:14] <shalotelli> which you can see here https://github.com/shalotelli/form_builder
[15:32:14] <lenswipe> coldhead, :)
[15:32:32] <shalotelli> converting the form to json style is not a problem
[15:32:51] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: have you tried doing a pure XMLHttpRequest to see if it works without jq?
[15:32:51] <shalotelli> â€¦.until i try and convert a select box
[15:33:02] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, yes - and it did
[15:33:26] <shalotelli> for some reason $(element).get(0) doesn't recognize select tag
[15:33:32] <shalotelli> is there a reason why?
[15:33:38] <eddiemonge> shalotelli: whats wrong with serialize?
[15:33:43] <shalotelli> <div class="control-group">
[15:33:44] <shalotelli>     <div class="controls">
[15:33:46] <shalotelli>       <select name="" id="select_basic">
[15:33:47] <shalotelli>         <option value="1">Option 1</option>
[15:33:49] <shalotelli>         <option value="2">Option 2</option>
[15:33:50] <shalotelli>         <option value="3">Option 3</option>
[15:33:51] <shalotelli>       </select>
[15:33:53] <shalotelli>     </div>
[15:33:55] <shalotelli> </div>
[15:33:56] <shalotelli> becomes {"tag":"div","class":"control-group","children":[
[15:33:58] <shalotelli>     {"tag":"div","class":"controls","children":[

[15:34:04] <smftre> wow, pastebin hello!

[15:34:06] <shalotelli>   ]}
[15:34:11] <shalotelli> lol sorry n00b
[15:34:36] * RandalSchwartz wipes the paste from his screen
[15:34:58] <lenswipe> holy....
[15:35:04] * smftre slaps shalotelli with a ..... WET FISH!
[15:35:05] <shalotelli> basically this will be used to create a questionnaire style form and ideally i would like a json object to be able to query against in another part of the system
[15:35:34] <coldhead> the number of lines of outrages against a paste must exceed the original paste
[15:35:45] <smftre> :D
[15:35:46] <eddiemonge> shalotelli: again, whats wrong with serialize? or keeping it as an object and not a strnig?
[15:35:51] <coldhead> we've got a long way to go

[15:38:07] <lenswipe> a sop problem?
[15:38:15] <shalotelli> eddiemonge creating a json string just seemed like the most sensible way to store the form, as multiple people will be filling out questionnaires, and there will be multiple questionnaires i thought a json object would be a good way to figure out what fields there are in the questionnaire and compare them to the results returned
[15:38:18] <eddiemonge> ?sop
[15:38:19] <b-ot> eddiemonge: Requests must respect the Same Origin Policy ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy ). Requesting cross-domain content in javascript is generally prohibited. Seeing OPTIONS requests? See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_access_control
[15:39:11] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: paste that chunk into console and see the error/output
[15:39:57] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: change the dataType to jsonp and try it
[15:40:09] <shalotelli> http://pastebin.com/XrsXY6j2
[15:40:12] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, that wouldn't really work - because of the way firefoxos works it requires that parameter passed in to make XHR requests - because most browsers don't that wouldn't be a problem
[15:40:36] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, changing to jsonp wouldn't work because I need to use a twitter api endpoint that doesn't support jsonp
[15:40:36] <fulminator> hello, can someone help me on this one: http://jsfiddle.net/7Y8hu/
[15:40:37] <Stew-a> eddiemonge: lenswipe and i have tracked down the construction of the XHR in the source code and it's not done the way it needs to be done, so we're trying to modify it now
[15:40:56] <shalotelli> this is the method that transforms the object into an array that can get formatted as json
[15:41:28] <lenswipe> got it working
[15:41:43] <eddiemonge> Stew-a: because its doing xhr[i] = instead of passing it in at creation?
[15:42:13] <eddiemonge> shalotelli: still dont understand why you cant use the object itself but i might be missing things
[15:42:38] <tw2113> *perk* firefox os?
[15:42:52] <shalotelli> the output is saved to the db and rendered later on
[15:42:58] <shalotelli> in another part of the system
[15:43:25] <Stew-a> eddiemonge: yes, that does appear to be a problem, lenswipe dropped it into the constructor and it's working fine now
[15:43:30] <shalotelli> so i just needed to convert it cleanly so that i can do what i need to with it later
[15:43:37] <Stew-a> eddiemonge: but thanks for your help anyway
[15:43:47] <shalotelli> if i just serialize does that have the same general result?
[15:44:21] <eddiemonge> shalotelli: how is it saved to the db?
[15:44:26] <eddiemonge> shalotelli: try it
[15:44:56] <shalotelli> its another guy implementing that part but I'm guessing just in a text field
[15:45:17] <jcp_> thanks eddiemonge finally found the callback. works perfectly
[15:45:22] <eddiemonge> Stew-a: patch or duck punch?
[15:45:46] <eddiemonge> shalotelli: i meant how are you getting it to the db? a post request? localstorage db?
[15:46:19] <shalotelli> ah i see it will be a post request
[15:46:41] <nod_> I'm confused about .attr and .prop, the api isn't totally clear for me, can someone help out? I'm migrating a large code base from jquery 1.8 to 1.9 (code was writting against version 1.4 actually)
[15:46:57] <shalotelli> http://shalotelli.github.com/form_builder/
[15:46:58] <eddiemonge> then serialize might be fine since it converts it to a string anyway. well converts the form data
[15:47:08] <shalotelli> if you look at that
[15:47:11] <shalotelli> its the same form builder
[15:47:27] <shalotelli> but the requirements of my project changed slightly
[15:48:00] <eddiemonge> nod_: did you read http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#attr-versus-prop- ?
[15:48:33] <shalotelli> so rather than just outputting the html source i needed to output the result in a way that can be stored in a database, and somewhere else in the system the result can be pulled from the database to compare a submitted form with the fields it has to know what to expect
[15:48:46] <shalotelli> that definitely didn't make sense but i can't really explain it properly lol
[15:48:48] <shalotelli> sorry
[15:49:15] <shalotelli> we talked in my team and decided that a json object containing the form elements would be a good way to store the data in the database
[15:50:12] <nod_> eddiemonge: yeah I did, still unclear. I got hundreds of .attr in the codebase, like .attr('id') or .attr('aria-autocomplete', 'list')
[15:50:46] <nod_> eddiemonge: should .prop be the default method I need to be using and only .attr in special cases of the other way around
[15:50:46] <nod_> ?
[15:50:47] <shalotelli> so the system lets you create a form, converts the html to a json object and saves it to the db, then somewhere else at a later date it can pull the object from the db, recreate the form from json back to html, be filled out by a user and submitted, then that data can be compared with the form itself to see the key => values
[15:52:21] <nod_> ok this helped: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874652/prop-vs-attr
[15:52:45] <Assimilater> quick question: is there a relatively simple way to interrupt form submissions for validation with just pure jquery or is it hairy enough that it's worth getting the plugin?
[15:54:00] <eddiemonge> Assimilater: bind to the form submit event
[15:55:53] <eddiemonge> $(form).on('submit', function(e) { if ( !validate ) { e.preventDefault(); });
[15:56:28] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: ah, indeed simple. /me tries it
[15:56:40] <Guest84719> hi
[16:07:26] <Assimilater> eddiemonge: works like a charm, thanks
[16:10:26] <mmlac> How do I get the size of the viewport (i.e. ONLY the size the user can actually see)?
[16:10:36] <mmlac> $(window).height() gives me the height of the complete page
[16:11:03] <mmlac> I need sth like document.documentElement.clientHeight apparently
[16:11:47] <mmlac> ok, forget the last comment, that breaks as well
[16:14:40] <mmlac> So why does $(window).height() show me the height of the complete content instead of the viewport?  :(
[16:16:34] <imsky> don't do window.height()
[16:17:09] <imsky> .innerHeight is much better
[16:17:14] <mmlac> setting body width and height o 100% helped. What a crap
[16:17:17] <mmlac> to*
[16:28:10] <Thoams> I still hate vbscript.
[16:28:29] <Thoams> And thank you, jQuery, you're almost as awesome as JSON.
[16:30:18] <danheberden> tw2113: now i feel rotten that i guessed that
[16:30:29] <tw2113> at least it's a free prize
[16:31:13] <jviotti> Hi guys, just a simple question... is there a way to pass a context to $.get callback? There is nothing in the docs
[16:32:49] <tw2113> danheberden, did that image make you think of the titanic?
[16:33:01] <danheberden> tw2113: haha "it's sinkkkkkkking"
[16:33:19] <tw2113> even has a wheel crank or whatever they're called
[16:34:47] <smftre> do you guys use AMD or something similar to split large JS projects?
[16:36:19] <tds5016> hi. Is there a way to add a variable that can be used by a member function of a jquery panel? for example... a variable that both beforeOpen and close can both use?
[16:36:33] <smftre> elaborate
[16:38:07] <tds5016> so basically I need to set a boolean value in beforeOpen then if it's set to true, I need to take an action on it in close.
[16:38:24] <tds5016> I don't want to have this variable in the larger scope, but I technically could, I guess.
[16:42:34] <naeluh> Hi I am try to get my code to work but I am getting an error in webkit Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'position' of null
[16:42:45] <naeluh> I can show  a link if that helps
[16:43:09] <Caelum> I got form reset to work in placeholder.js: http://gist.github.com/5259197
[16:43:32] <tds5016> smftre: does that make sense what I'm looking for?
[16:44:03] <Caelum> naeluh: check if the object you're trying to get the position property from is null
[16:44:31] <naeluh> Caelum: ok how would I go about doing that ?
[16:44:50] <Caelum> naeluh: if (obj) alert(obj.position)
[16:46:00] <naeluh> Caelum: would that be my div or would I use that exact code
[16:46:30] <naeluh> Caelum: obj - mydiv
[16:46:44] <Caelum> naeluh: you shouldn't be getting null for a div
[16:46:52] <naeluh> oh really
[16:47:12] <Caelum> naeluh: can you put something up on jsfiddle or jsbin
[16:47:25] <Caelum> naeluh: then someone here can help you
[16:47:48] <tds5016> one other question... is there a way to get what is currently associated with the swiperight on() function?
[16:48:51] <naeluh> Caelum: well the thing is I have it working its just I just have an issue in webkit where the position in viewport is wrong I can figure why it would be doing this only in webkit and I feel like this error has something to with it
[16:49:35] <Caelum> naeluh: it means you're trying to do something with javascript that's not cross-browser, you should find a way to do it with the jquery API instead
[16:49:38] <naeluh> Caelum: I am using the jquery plugin zoomooz and the maintainer does have time to correct the problem so I am trying to fix it myself
[16:53:45] <naeluh> Caelum: you know what I am just going to scrap it thanks
[16:54:08] <tds5016> or it's even better if I can do something like .off() and then .on() to reenable the action?
[17:02:21] <Asterokid> eddiemonge: thanks all much more reliable when JS is at the end... Basically if I understand well, window onload is called when all the resource are loaded. document onload is not necessary when putting JS at the end.
[17:30:42] <tds5016> hey. is it possible to get the callback I've set on something with $.on?
[17:32:02] <mangoman> how do I get the HTTP request body in a $.ajax statusCode?
[17:35:47] <eddiemonge> you mean get the response from an ajax call?
[17:36:56] <mangoman> yes, using the statusCode (pattern?)
[17:37:21] <eddiemonge> it would be in the success callback
[17:38:09] <mangoman> is there a way to get it in a statusCode function?
[17:38:41] <eddiemonge> what is a statusCode function?
[17:39:39] <mangoman> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ it's passed to $.ajax() for handling individual HTTP response codes
[17:40:27] <eddiemonge> oh. thats what you are talkng about. did you ready it?
[17:40:29] <eddiemonge> If the request is successful, the status code functions take the same parameters as the success callback
[17:43:26] <mangoman> oh, okay
[17:59:42] <omani_> how do I get the names of an object
[18:00:14] <omani_> if my object is: Object { Mon=2, Fri=2, Sun=6 }
[18:00:30] <omani_> I could say obj.Mon or obj.Fri
[18:00:36] <omani_> but what if I don't know the names
[18:00:51] <omani_> and I want to look up how the elements are names
[18:00:52] <omani_> named
[18:00:57] <omani_> is this possible?
[18:03:14] <Changa> Hello: I have a facebook like button, that is hidden. When registration is complete, the div containing the like button is shown using .show(); but the like button only shows up when the page is reloaded. It does not show when the div containing it is called vie .show(); here is the page -> http://edizarca.com/karpaz (sessions are disabled) so a new form will come if you refresh the page to
[18:03:14] <Changa> try again
[18:03:47] <Changa> anyone know how to solve this?
[18:05:22] <coldhead> i suspect facebook isn't bothering to render their magic button in a hidden container
[18:05:48] <coldhead> it might work better if you do the show() and then inject the FB scuzz with .html()
[18:06:00] <coldhead> i pretty much hate facebook though so im not one to ask
[18:25:14] <tds5016> is there a way to get the function associated with an element's on?
[18:25:47] <tds5016> so... $('foo).on('tap', function(){console.log('asdf');});
[18:25:56] <tds5016> is there a way to ge ta copy of the function?
[18:26:01] <tds5016> the*
[18:26:21] <aaron1245> so you can re-use later?
[18:32:31] <tds5016> aaron1245: exactly.
[18:32:51] <tds5016> The actual events are in different views. which is partially why it's problematic.
[18:33:03] <aaron1245> couldn't you just write a function outside and call it in the callback function
[18:33:13] <aaron1245> and pass in whatever vars are changing
[18:33:26] <tds5016> view 1 has view 2 and view 3. view 2 does something that should remove an event from view 1
[18:33:59] <tds5016> aaron1245: that would be straightforward if the two views were to "know about" eachother.
[18:34:27] <aaron1245> ah
[18:34:47] <tds5016> aaron1245: I'm trying to avoid that situation.
[18:35:00] <tds5016> I'm trying to make it so that it'll disable swiperight when you've done swipeleft.
[18:35:25] <tds5016> and it'll disable swipeleft when you've done swipe left. then when you go the oposite direction, it'll reenable.
[18:35:34] <danheberden> swiper, no swiping!
[18:37:58] <gerep> I have a function to validate some fields. I have the password and password_confirmation, how can I check if there is a xxxxxx_confirmation field so I can compare its value with the xxxxxx field?
[18:40:09] <gerep> I'm trying to make something generic so I can use it with any other fields that I need confirmation
[18:44:35] <echoee> hi guys
[18:45:15] <echoee> anyone able to help me with a very peculiar issue regarding iOS touch devices?
[18:46:39] <coldhead> does it relate to jQuery?
[18:46:42] <echoee> essentially, I have a checkbox wrapped arond the label, that when pressed anywhere else but on the checkbox itself, it works, but when you press on the actual checkbox, it works visually (jquery update to render the tick), but it doesnt send the info to the server
[18:47:20] <coldhead> is that even valid html? i didn't think puts could contain things
[18:47:37] <echoee> basically, input type="checkbox" with jquery controlling the span
[18:47:56] <echoee> hmmm, just realised i phased that wrongly
[18:48:17] <coldhead> code speaks louder than words about code
[18:48:20] <echoee> i have a <label> wrapped around an input type="checkbox"
[19:19:59] <b-lew> Can I score some help on this page. http://bvh.delineamultimedia.com/?page_id=2 -> http://bvh.delineamultimedia.com/wp-content/themes/bvh/js/portfolio/superbox.js -> this is what I'm having problems with. It seems to be rendering because everytime I click on the first image I get a new image in the gallery but for some reason the prev and next buttons in the gallery aren't working dynamically.
[19:27:54] <rebel_yell> hey guys for twitter bootstrap is there a reason     e.stopPropagation(); wouldnt work on a dropdown?
[20:06:45] <rebel_yell> hey guys
[20:06:45] <rebel_yell> https://gist.github.com/rebellabs/5260216
[20:07:15] <rebel_yell> quick question so im trying to keep my twtitter bootstrap dropdown open
[20:07:29] <rebel_yell> can someone tell me what might be wrong in that gist
[20:08:39] <rebel_yell> anyone online?
[20:09:50] <rebel_yell> nobdy
[20:09:57] <coldhead> sorry :(
[20:10:19] <rebel_yell> no worries
[20:10:38] <rebel_yell> its bugging me because everywhere i look its the same answer but the answer doesnt work
[20:10:44] <rebel_yell> maybe a fresh pair of eyes could help
[20:13:52] <rebel_yell> coldhead any luck?
[20:14:54] <coldhead> i don't know a damn thing about twitter bootstrap soz
[20:16:17] <rebel_yell> damn
[20:17:21] <Andrew_R> rebel_yell: you said dropdown? maybe you want $('.dropdown-menu select')?
[20:18:44] <rebel_yell> no salt
[20:18:51] <yogurt_truck> there's neither an "input" nor a "select" in a bootstrap dropdown button widget
[20:19:13] <yogurt_truck> so i've no idea where what '.dropdown-menu input' selector is supposed to be
[20:19:24] <rebel_yell> Andrew_R: there is an input because if check off a checkbox i get it to search button click
[20:20:08] <Andrew_R> ok I don't know either, what is the actual output of  <%= check_box_tag 'q[pricecategory_eq_any][]', category %> <%=category %> ?
[20:20:47] <rebel_yell> <input id="q_measurementcategory_eq_any_" name="q[measurementcategory_eq_any][]" type="checkbox" value="0-4,000">
[20:21:03] <yogurt_truck> it doesn't matter what your custom markup is
[20:21:47] <yogurt_truck> bootstrap sets its event handlers to respond to _its_ elements, regardless of what you fill them with
[20:23:14] <rebel_yell> should this stop it though
[20:23:21] <rebel_yell>     e.stopPropagation();
[20:23:22] <lamarus> is there a way with the built in functionality to rotate an image 90 deg over x amount of time
[20:23:31] <lamarus> can that be done with .animate()
[20:23:49] <yogurt_truck> rebel_yell: stop what?
[20:23:58] <yogurt_truck> rebel_yell: ahhh, stop the widget from doing its thing?
[20:24:03] <rebel_yell> the dropdown closing after i click a checkbox
[20:28:41] <Andrew_R> is the drop down a normal select?
[20:29:03] <rebel_yell> its an input select
[20:29:06] <rebel_yell> with li
[20:29:22] <echoee> question, how do you get hte name?
[20:29:31] <echoee> q[measurementcategory_eq_any][]
[20:29:33] <echoee> that name
[20:29:49] <Andrew_R> rebel_yell: what does that mean? Does the HTML look like <select></select> ?
[20:30:09] <Andrew_R> for the dropdown you want to keep open
[20:30:20] <rebel_yell> input input
[20:30:51] <yogurt_truck> Andrew_R: bootstrap's dropdown thing grabs some UL-based markup structure and styles it and gives it a drop down behavior. it's nothing to do with select elements
[20:31:43] <rebel_yell> its wierd because if you google it the known fixx is the stopprognation
[20:31:52] <rebel_yell> but its not working with this scenario
[20:32:41] <Andrew_R> yogurt_truck: thanks, I wasn't sure. if it was a normal <select> it can't be done.
[20:36:56] <yogurt_truck> rebel_yell: re-check your markup or something cause I just tested this on one of my bootstrap sites and it works as expected (only tested on webkit though)
[20:37:33] <yogurt_truck> that is, I added a checkbox to one of my dropdown items and ran $('.dropdown-menu > *').click(function (e) { e.stopPropagation(); })
[20:38:29] <yogurt_truck> works with the '.dropdown-menu input' selector, too
[20:40:18] <rebel_yell> weird
[20:40:23] <rebel_yell> let me try right now
[20:40:25] <yogurt_truck> rebel_yell: strip down your dropdown markup to the bare minimum (remove all that template logic) test it with a dummy checkbox, and go from there
[20:42:22] <yogurt_truck> also make sure there isn't another JS lib messing things up event-wise. like, some built-in frontend functionality of whatever web framework you're using, or something
[20:42:28] <rebel_yell> yogurt_truck: can u gist me one of your working dropdowns
[20:44:31] <Andrew_R> yogurt_truck: maybe you can make this work? The alert doesn't show in FF or Chrome http://jsfiddle.net/Zqx6y/1/
[20:48:08] <Assimilater> Anyone familiar with the treeview plugin? I'm trying to figure out how to work with it to a) on load make sure the selected (blue) node's parent is open and b) when a folder's span is clicked and it's not selected select it and DON'T toggle the display (open or closed) but if it's clicked when selected go ahead and toggle it. Here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DDzNn/1/
[20:48:17] <yogurt_truck> Andrew_R: it works if you fix the syntax error :D
[20:48:42] <yogurt_truck> (missing right parens at the end)
[20:48:43] <Andrew_R> haha :)
[20:49:47] <yogurt_truck> ^ rebel_yell: see Andrew_R's fiddle
[20:49:54] <yogurt_truck> food. bbl
[20:49:57] <Andrew_R> I didn't notice lol... yep working ok after fixing the error

[20:51:28] <SoulShadow> is there an easy way to center an entire page of text?
[20:51:38] <SoulShadow> like something i can put in a div
[20:52:27] <coldhead> <center></center>
[20:52:41] <abjorn> *shudder*
[20:52:42] <coldhead> or div { text-align: center }
[20:52:56] <abjorn> ^
[20:53:03] <Assimilater> SoulShadow: <center> is less prefered, and old. Usee the latter css
[20:53:15] <SoulShadow> mmkay
[20:53:23] <Assimilater> SoulShadow: you can also edit css <div style="text-align: center">
[20:53:43] <coldhead> inline style is no better than <center>
[20:53:53] <Assimilater> a *little* better
[20:54:00] <SoulShadow> that last one worked perfectly, i only needed it for one page
[20:54:11] <SoulShadow> modifying the css for a single page seems overkill
[20:54:50] <RobW> anyone using win8/ie10?
[20:55:03] <Assimilater> double eww
[20:55:07] <RobW> heheh
[20:55:14] <SoulShadow> ie10 is actually pretty damn good
[20:55:15] <SoulShadow> you'd be surprised
[20:55:26] <SoulShadow> MS has come a long way
[20:55:27] <Assimilater> i don't care unless they fixed their box model
[20:55:57] <RobW> its broken in win8
[20:56:22] <SoulShadow> i'm on win8 right now, if you need something tested
[20:56:41] <omani_> anyone knows flot.js?
[20:56:43] <omani_> flotchart?
[20:56:48] <RobW> SoulShadow: have ie10?
[20:56:51] <omani_> I just don't get this plugin
[20:56:56] <coldhead> it's still proprietary software, however sexy
[20:57:12] <SoulShadow> RobW: it's built into the OS, so yes
[20:57:12] <coldhead> can you be more specific about your problem omani_ ?
[20:57:14] <RobW> SoulShadow: can you visit http://sparknh.org/ -- do you see the calendar on the top right?
[20:57:15] <Assimilater> coldhead: oh ya that too
[20:57:47] <coldhead> everything's starting now

[20:59:59] <SoulShadow> i am very thankful for finding jquery, had a client asking for a mobile website and jquery made it 100x easier
[21:00:20] <RobW> SoulShadow: one quick thing
[21:00:23] <RandalSchwartz> thank the resig!
[21:00:33] <RobW> can you try zooming in a little, and then refresh the page? see if it disappears
[21:00:42] <RobW> I wonder if they're accidentally zoomed in.. and the content block disappears
[21:00:43] <SoulShadow> if you can give me 5 mins
[21:01:01] <RandalSchwartz> SoulShadow - jsfiddle!
[21:01:17] <SoulShadow> RandalSchwartz: what about it?
[21:01:41] <RandalSchwartz> use that for your demo
[21:01:48] <RandalSchwartz> if you want help
[21:01:55] <SoulShadow> i got my help already
[21:04:10] <SoulShadow> RobW: it disappears if i have it pinned to a side
[21:04:15] <SoulShadow> but as soon as i maximize it's there
[21:04:28] <RobW> eh?
[21:04:33] <RobW> so like.. if the browser width is too small?
[21:04:35] <SoulShadow> yeah
[21:04:40] <RobW> how small?
[21:04:49] <SoulShadow> i'm on 1920x1080 and i snapped it to half screen
[21:05:01] <SoulShadow> so, 960x1080 was the res
[21:05:07] <Assimilater> Anyone familiar with the treeview plugin? I'm trying to figure out how to work with it to a) on load make sure the selected (blue) node's parent is open and b) when a folder's span is clicked and it's not selected select it and DON'T toggle the display (open or closed) but if it's clicked when selected go ahead and toggle it. Here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/DDzNn/1/
[21:05:07] <SoulShadow> give or take a few pixels for the browser window
[21:05:16] <RobW> that should still be plenty of room no?
[21:05:53] <SoulShadow> it shows up once the sidebar closes
[21:06:08] <SoulShadow> but it's slightly cut off and you can't scroll
[21:06:38] <RobW> SoulShadow; refresh and let me know?
[21:06:55] <SoulShadow> nothing changed
[21:06:58] <RobW> and, is the committees still visible?
[21:07:00] <SoulShadow> want a pic?
[21:07:16] <RobW> sure
[21:07:34] <SoulShadow> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8696693/half.png
[21:07:35] <RobW> i just tried to set the widths of the parents is all..
[21:07:47] <RobW> oh
[21:07:49] <RobW> the calendar is still there..
[21:07:54] <RobW> just cut off
[21:07:55] <SoulShadow> yeah, as i said it gets cut off
[21:07:57] <RobW> not my problem
[21:08:06] <SoulShadow> if the sidebar is expanded the calendar disappears, though
[21:08:15] <RobW> yeah it pushes all content to the right
[21:08:28] <RobW> in her ss, it showed a full screen (1920x1080) and the calendar was completely missing
[21:08:35] <SoulShadow> weird
[21:08:35] <RobW> but the sidebar had already collapsed.. so I know there's no JS error.
[21:08:44] <SoulShadow> and the ss i sent you was 1680x1050 (rdp'd)
[21:08:47] <RobW> eff it. PEBKAC or browser needs reset :o
[21:09:00] <SoulShadow> now comes the fun part for me
[21:09:07] <SoulShadow> figuring out how to put google maps in a dialog box
[21:09:09] <SoulShadow> :|
[21:10:01] * Assimilater goes off to bed, 'night
[21:10:50] <coldhead> bye forever, Assimilater
[21:11:40] <SoulShadow> so googling this it seems maps likes to freak out inside a dialog box
[21:18:16] <rebel_yell> yogurt_truck:  i guess im not loading the plug in correctly :(
[21:18:23] <rebel_yell> because its still not working
[21:20:02] <defsum> Hello, I'm newb to js. How can I load DIV-block and its content (responsiveslides.min.js) into browser just after click-event on specified element. Some kind of lazyload I guess... ?
[21:20:34] <defsum> content of my DIV is list of images, obviously
[21:21:18] <defsum> they're way too much, I need load slider's images only after Click-event on every slider on current page
[21:23:18] <defsum> To put it simply: how can I "lazyload" images in specified DIV by clicking on that DIV?
[21:25:51] <hip2p> here's a first. IE is correctly displaying my site, and chrome and firefox are not
[21:26:29] <hip2p> anyone ever use a popover plugin and have a problem where the popover window appears in the upper left hand corner? It works fine in IE.
[21:29:21] <hip2p> hmm it works when I zoom out
[21:36:57] <hip2p> anyone else here ever use pspad?
[21:41:16] <Vadova> Wizzard of the internet !
[21:41:39] <Vadova> I have a issue that I cant seem to understand
[21:42:28] <Vadova> as far as I get it .prependTo() will insert an element to as 1st object
[21:42:53] <Vadova> but when I combine it with a for loop it seems I get it in reverse order
[21:42:57] <Vadova> what is happening ?
[21:43:21] <rebel_yell> Andrew_R: dude stilll no luck
[21:43:33] <danheberden> Vadova: that makes sense
[21:43:34] <danheberden> if you keep prepending
[21:43:34] <danheberden> you keep adding to the beginning
[21:45:37] <Vadova> hmm I dont understand I'm telling it to add to the beninning but I get 4 3 2 1 0 instead of 0 1 2 3 4 , so how would I go about this using properly in a loop ?
[21:45:54] <Andrew_R> rebel_yell: sorry man, no idea. it's working in the fiddle.
[21:46:12] <danheberden> Vadova: loop backwards? great a node of elements and then append its children? all kinds of possibilities
[21:46:33] <SoulShadow> anyone in here using jquery mobile?
[21:46:39] <danheberden> Vadova: as for understanding, if you were iterating over elements 0 - 4 - and you "prepended" 0, then "prepended" 1'
[21:46:44] <danheberden> you're putting 0 first
[21:46:47] <danheberden> then you're putting 1 first
[21:46:51] <Andrew_R> check to make sure you're setting the click even in a document ready and that you are actually hitting the click function
[21:46:51] <danheberden> then 2, then 3, then 4
[21:46:55] <SoulShadow> my footer is disappearing off the page when i start to scroll, is there any way to force it to always show
[21:47:08] <danheberden> so your ultimate order is 4,3,2,1,0,original-content
[21:47:32] <rebel_yell>       $('div.btn.dropdown-toggle.btn-inverse').click();
[21:47:41] <rebel_yell> im just gonna have it click on the toggle
[21:47:43] <rebel_yell> again
[21:47:47] <Vadova> ou =/
[21:47:59] <rebel_yell> quick question though how do i make it click the right toggle
[21:48:02] <rebel_yell> this ?
[21:48:32] <defaultro> hey guys, assuming we have assigned an url variable in url.js file. For ex: var url = 'http://somesite.com/v2/static/'+hash+'/512/randomizer'; Let's say the current value of the dynamic hash variable is deadb33f. When the webpage is loaded, url will be http://somesite.com/v2/static/deadb33f/512/randomizer'.  How can I update the hash variable without reloading the webpage assuming the value got updated?
[21:49:09] <danheberden> defaultro: make url a function
[21:49:12] <danheberden> url(hash)
[21:49:17] <defaultro> k
[21:49:23] <defaultro> then
[21:49:49] <defaultro> so this url will often get called?
[21:50:10] <Vadova> for some reason it make now less sence =))
[21:50:14] <danheberden> i don't know, it's not my website defaultro :p
[21:50:18] <Vadova> since i'm building a ticker
[21:50:28] <defaultro> no,the url function you suggested
[21:50:41] <danheberden> defaultro: how often do you use the url variable?
[21:51:12] <defaultro> i actually just wanted to be safe but looks like the value will never happen during weekdays
[21:51:21] <danheberden> if it's less than like, 5000 times, you're fine
[21:51:22] <defaultro> will never change
[21:52:03] <defaultro> k
[21:52:07] <rebel_yell> how can i make sure it toggles the right dropdown
[21:52:08] <rebel_yell>   $('.dropdown-menu input').click(function() {       $('#search_button').click();       $('div.btn.dropdown-toggle.btn-inverse').click();     });
[21:54:57] <Commander_Cody> Can someone tell me what's the error in my 3-liner-scroll code: http://jsbin.com/ayijol/5/edit
[21:54:58] <Andrew_R> rebel_yell: maybe .closest() ? $(this).closest('div.btn.dropdown-toggle.btn-inverse').click;
[21:56:26] <rebel_yell> no salt
[21:56:38] <rebel_yell> is closest a thing iv never heard of it thats awesome
[21:56:45] <Andrew_R> ? closest
[21:56:52] <Andrew_R> where my bot?
[21:57:08] <Andrew_R> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[21:57:58] <danheberden> `api closest
[21:57:58] <b-ot> danheberden: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[21:58:09] <Andrew_R> ah thanks
[21:58:19] <b-ot> you're welcome
[21:59:09] <devslash> I've got a problem i can't figure out. in my javascript code I added this line: alert($('.fileTreeCSS li').css('height')); on desktop browsers it displays 18px which is fine. on  mobile browsers like chrome and firefox for android it displays undefined
[21:59:52] <danheberden> maybe there is no height set in those style sheets?
[22:00:00] <danheberden> .height() !== .css('height')
[22:00:04] <devslash> why wouldn't there be ?
[22:00:12] <danheberden> i donno, it's not my site :p
[22:00:13] <devslash> its the same site
[22:00:16] <danheberden> just offering possiblitiles
[22:00:19] <devslash> it uses the same style sheet
[22:00:22] <danheberden> or possibilities even
[22:02:31] <Andrew_R> devslash: and what happens if you use .height() ?
[22:02:58] <devslash> isame thing
[22:03:17] <danheberden> does that element exist?
[22:03:19] <danheberden> for sure?
[22:03:19] <devslash> returns 18 on desktop browsers, undefined in mobile browsers
[22:03:21] <devslash> yes
[22:03:23] <devslash> 100%
[22:04:11] <danheberden> console.log($('.fileTreeCSS li').length) is 1 or more? and the first item isn't collapsed or anythig?
[22:04:38] <devslash> yes
[22:05:26] <Commander_Cody> Sry for noob question, but why does this 3-liner scroll not work? http://jsbin.com/ayijol/5/edit
[22:07:44] <Andrew_R> Commander_Cody: pos.style.position = ((document.documentElement.scrollTop) > 200); 'fixed'; is a syntax error
[22:07:53] <rebel_yell> Andrew_R:  any other suggestions besides closest
[22:09:01] <Andrew_R> pos.style.position = ((document.documentElement.scrollTop > 200) ? 'fixed' : 'normal';
[22:09:08] <Andrew_R> ps not jquery question
[22:10:05] <Commander_Cody> Andrew_R: damn. I just wanted to achieve that: IF u scroll past 200 pixel in browser window, then add a 'position:fixed' to the div
[22:10:07] <Andrew_R> rebel_yell: do you think your .click() on the dropdown button will work? with the code you had, did it open all the checkboxes?
[22:10:52] <Andrew_R> Commander_Cody: wouldn't you change it back to normal if you scroll back above 200px?
[22:10:56] <rebel_yell> it opened the far right now
[22:11:17] <rebel_yell> far right one*
[22:11:28] <Commander_Cody> Andrew_R: yes, I should do that too
[22:12:34] <Andrew_R> pos.style.position = (document.documentElement.scrollTop > 200) ? 'fixed' : 'normal'; -- this will set position to fixed if scrollTop is > 200 or normal if it is not
[22:13:46] <djQuery> whats going on
[22:14:23] <Andrew_R> hey djQ
[22:16:47] <djQuery> hate it when projects expect arbritrary custom attributes in elements
[22:16:48] <Commander_Cody> Andrew_R: the new code http://jsbin.com/ayijol/6/edit still doesnt workâ€¦ What is really missing is probably fundamental understanding at meâ€¦
[22:16:50] <bsdbofh> Hey all, I've got a problem with draggable/sortable. I have class 1 set to draggable, and another class, 2, set to sortable. and I can drag a 1 div from one 2 div into another 2 div… but only once.
[22:16:56] <bsdbofh> After that, I can't drag it anywhere else again.
[22:17:06] <bsdbofh> So, it's like, it gets stuck after one drag/clone.
[22:17:20] <bsdbofh> any ideas?
[22:17:47] <djQuery> bsdbofh, did you look at the connected sortables demo?
[22:17:57] <bsdbofh> yeah
[22:18:03] <bsdbofh> did I not look hard enough? hehe
[22:19:11] <djQuery> bsdbofh, probs
[22:19:48] <djQuery> if you are gonna create a plugin that works on page load without having to be called require that peeps add a class then use real data-atrr names

[22:24:28] <coldhead> it's cool, i'll do it for him
[22:24:32] <coldhead> when do you need it by?
[22:24:45] <anand> @djQuery not so
[22:25:18] <anand> do people here are aware of AWS Cloud Formation
[22:25:47] <anand> i ll explain you what i am going to come out with and its opensource at the end
[22:26:21] <anand> i just need some one to help me out with how to start
[22:26:40] <djQuery> anand, so yo umean the easy part
[22:27:01] <coldhead> open your text editor
[22:27:10] <djQuery> coldhead, whats that?
[22:27:27] <djQuery> coldhead, do you mean MS Word?
[22:27:38] <Andrew_R> Commander_Cody: http://jsbin.com/ayijol/8/
[22:28:03] <Andrew_R> hold on
[22:28:12] <coldhead> you CAN use ms word but you need to put every line as a bullet point
[22:28:21] <coldhead> and then "save as html"
[22:29:50] <anand> @djQuery & @coldhead ya need mainely is that will it can be done with jquery or i need to go with "Flex" or "Flash" for building it
[22:30:11] <Andrew_R> Commander_Cody: http://jsbin.com/ayijol/10/ - 'static' is the correct position to change it back to
[22:30:26] <aaron1245> Anyone well versed with jquery mobile and panels?  I need 5 minutes of someones time, I'll pay.  I've been trying to figure this out all day and I'm going out of my mind...
[22:32:47] <Commander_Cody> Andrew_R: THANK YOU! with this demo I should soon make it runâ€¦ And thanks for helping those noobs as me I don't want to imagine how annoying this must beâ€¦
[22:33:32] <Andrew_R> Commander_Cody: np glad it's working, and I could always disconnect lol :)
[22:33:53] <anand> A builder to create AWS Cloudformation Template with just drag drop and end out should be an JSON in AWS CF Standrard
[22:34:11] <djQuery> Andrew_R, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8418583/can-i-keep-a-div-always-on-the-screen-but-not-always-in-a-fixed-position
[22:34:28] <djQuery> Commander_Cody, ^^^^
[22:34:47] <anand> and the drag drop icons and resources should follow AWS icon standards
[22:34:58] <Commander_Cody> Searched for hours in www but didn't find this oneâ€¦ thanks djQuery!
[22:35:57] <djQuery> Commander_Cody, ques my google foo is better than yours
[22:36:06] <djQuery> this is what I searched on :) https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=css%20keep%20div%20on%20screen%20when%20scrolling&oq=&gs_l=&pbx=1&fp=28bbe2e8b9a25fd4&ion=1&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.44342787,d.b2I&biw=1041&bih=966
[22:38:09] <Commander_Cody> djQuery: far supreme to the problems I searched for
[22:40:00] <djQuery> Commander_Cody, notice how div1 stays in the lower left corner on this one. http://jsbin.com/ayijol/12/edit
[22:43:19] <rideh> $(this).toggleClass('active').siblings().removeClass('active')  will add active, and remove from all siblings, and if it is active - will remove from itself and all siblings right?
[22:43:45] <djQuery> rideh, yes thats what it would do
[22:43:53] <rideh> djQuery: thx
[22:44:23] <djQuery> rideh, BUT you might want to do $(this).toggleClass('active').siblings('.active').removeClass('active')
[22:44:45] <djQuery> so it doesnt have to go through each of the siblings on the siblings that have active on them
[22:45:20] <rideh> if there are only 5, is it better for it to look at each for the class or just pass through and perform the operation anyways?
[22:45:33] <rideh> either way it has to interate through them right?
[22:46:01] <rideh> i won't ever know enougha bout how jQuery works on the backend to know whats best for performance
[22:46:33] <djQuery> rideh, mine will be faster but with only 5 not noticable at all
[22:46:47] <Commander_Cody> djQuery Andrew_R after almost getting desperate, I realize i should have found this far earlier on your stackoverflow link
[22:47:00] <djQuery> but say if you were doing this on a table with 100 rows then definelty mine
[22:47:01] <rideh> djQuery: i'll do what you recommend, rather learn 1 way
[22:47:08] <Commander_Cody> they offer a supreme code and it is not offtopic but in jquery :)
[22:47:47] <djQuery> Commander_Cody, peeps on there take great care to write decent code
[22:48:16] <djQuery> they want high rankings and bad stuff floats to the bottom and good stuff always gets floated to the top
[22:48:20] <djQuery> well most the time
[22:48:52] <Commander_Cody> djQuery: i know this and i would never register thereâ€¦ But in this case this was useful
[22:49:24] <bsdbofh> ugh. yeah I've got nothing. I just don't see why these can be dragged once, but not again. script example: http://pastebin.com/jCwMbD6R
[22:49:26] <djQuery> Commander_Cody, why not register there?
[22:49:35] <Commander_Cody> Will learn jquery in near future
[22:49:43] <Commander_Cody> bc my time is limited
[22:50:14] <djQuery> Commander_Cody, ?tryjq
[22:50:26] <Commander_Cody> i would f.ex be an excellent wikipedia author (have very good allround knowledge and already detected many errors there). But i hate the admin behaviour
[22:50:26] <djQuery> Commander_Cody, try.jquery.com
[22:52:11] <Commander_Cody> and their criteria. the problem with most 'social' things and boards in the www is the people and if a group may offer me best chance to develop skills, i will never join if that means they treat me bad. that's all reason, djQuery
[22:52:23] <djQuery> Commander_Cody, I know a lot about a little, and a little about a lot and google fills in the rest
[22:52:27] <Commander_Cody> djQuery: bookmarked the link, will try it
[22:55:43] <bsdbofh> hmm, i'm seeing some bug talk on this very thing, but that was back on 1.5
[22:55:48] <bsdbofh> surely it's been fixed in 2 years
[23:00:18] <djQuery> bsdbofh, can you put together an actual demo and I will see if I can help
[23:00:51] <djQuery> `demo@bsdbofh
[23:01:10] <djQuery> dang lazy bots   use a jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com
[23:03:45] <suuuuper> Quick question if you guys don
[23:03:49] <suuuuper> t mind.
[23:04:22] <Andrew_R> ` ask
[23:04:30] <suuuuper> Im using isotope and here is a snippet of script im using: $container.isotope('reLayout'); $('html, body').animate({scrollTop:$('.item').offset().top - 100}, 'fast');
[23:04:33] <Andrew_R> djQuery: I'm no good with the bots either
[23:04:55] <suuuuper> now after the relayout i want to scroll to the top of a div
[23:04:56] <Andrew_R> `ask
[23:04:56] <b-ot> Andrew_R: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:05:02] <djQuery> Andrew_R, well it helps when they are actual connected
[23:05:37] <suuuuper> but a lot of times the scroll to top fires before the relayout causing the wrong variable
[23:06:08] <suuuuper> so how do i make the relayout fire, then the scroll to top fire, which gets the correct variable now that relayout has launched
[23:06:14] <djQuery> suuuuper, does isotope have a callout for when relayout is complete
[23:07:51] <suuuuper> djQuery I do not beleive so
[23:07:54] <djQuery> suuuuper, yes it does  $container.isotope('reLayout', function(){$('html, body').animate({scrollTop:$('.item').offset().top - 100}, 'fast');});
[23:08:12] <bsdbofh> djQuery, http://jsfiddle.net/yyB2N/
[23:08:13] <djQuery> suuuuper, looking at the doc now .isotope( 'reLayout', callback )
[23:08:23] <djQuery> suuuuper, http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/methods.html
[23:08:26] <bsdbofh> thanks for the assistance. hell, it's probably just me missing something cause it's late heh
[23:08:42] <djQuery> suuuuper, http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/methods.html#relayout
[23:08:44] <bsdbofh> but in any case, I really do appreciate your eyes on it. :)
[23:10:52] <djQuery> bsdbofh, well I can drag multiple from to-
[23:11:06] <suuuuper> djQuery, so as I understand it callbacks are fired after teh function is complete but im not really sure how to format the code for the callback
[23:11:26] <bsdbofh> you can?
[23:11:33] <Andrew_R> suuuuper: he already gave it to you ^^
[23:11:39] <djQuery> suuuuper, just like this  $container.isotope('reLayout', function(){$('html, body').animate({scrollTop:$('.item').offset().top - 100}, 'fast');});
[23:11:54] <suuuuper> thank you djquery!
[23:12:10] <djQuery> suuuuper, I just moved your code inside a function as the 2nd option of relayout
[23:13:56] <suuuuper> i see, sorry I missed the first time you gave it to me. the code works great
[23:16:04] <djQuery> bsdbofh, you are getting an error when dropping Uncaught ReferenceError: drop is not defined
[23:16:46] <bsdbofh> no
[23:17:17] <bsdbofh> error shows up clean
[23:17:35] <bsdbofh> s/error/error log/
[23:18:28] <Bangalore-Thatha> hi
[23:19:15] <djQuery> bsdbofh, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/yyB2N/4/
[23:19:45] <djQuery> bsdbofh, hit f12 before draggin then go to the console tab and d n d something
[23:19:47] <Bangalore-Thatha> any css guru here?
[23:20:05] <djQuery> Bangalore-Thatha, lots of them in #css channel
[23:20:15] <Andrew_R> Bangalore-Thatha: this is #jquery
[23:21:15] <djQuery> bsdbofh, if (drop == "valid") {   drop is not defined anywhere
[23:21:24] <bsdbofh> djqhttp://jsfiddle.net/yyB2N/5/
[23:21:37] <bsdbofh> djQuery, http://jsfiddle.net/yyB2N/5/
[23:21:41] <bsdbofh> yeah, small update there.
[23:21:55] <bsdbofh> that was my bad destroy clone code
[23:22:49] <djQuery> bsdbofh, hmmm still got a Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'options' of undefined
[23:23:01] <bsdbofh> on 5?
[23:24:04] <rideh> if I do $('.class').click() and click div#obj1.class  will $(this) refer only to div#obj1.class or also to any .class?
[23:24:05] <djQuery> bsdbofh, yes it is still happening in the stop function of draggable
[23:24:28] <bsdbofh> i ditched the stop function on update 5 there, http://jsfiddle.net/yyB2N/5/
[23:24:40] <bsdbofh> it shouldn't be in the script
[23:24:44] <djQuery> rideh, it will refer to the actual .class that was clicked
[23:24:48] <djQuery> I see that
[23:25:14] <djQuery> bsdbofh, no its in the actual jquery-ui.js file that the error is happening
[23:25:16] <rideh> djQuery: by actual do you mean the single instance?
[23:25:25] <djQuery> rideh, yes
[23:25:35] <rideh> djQuery: thats pretty slick thanks
[23:26:05] <bsdbofh> on update 5, i see some css warnings, but nothing in the error logs.
[23:26:21] <djQuery> <ul><li id="id1" class="clickable">1</li>li id="id2" class="clickable">2</li></ul>
[23:27:02] <djQuery> rideh, $(ul).on('click', 'li.clickable', function(e){ console.log(this.id);});
[23:28:46] <djQuery> bsdbofh, move 2 items to done, then move 1 item to in progress
[23:28:51] <djQuery> error occurs
[23:29:08] <djQuery> wierd
[23:29:34] <djQuery> I was able to move all to in progress and all to done with no error but split it up and there are error
[23:29:35] <djQuery> s
[23:29:41] <djQuery> bsdbofh, ^^
[23:30:24] <bsdbofh> hmm, yeah I see that error
[23:30:44] <djQuery> 2 in progress and then 1 in done no error
[23:31:44] <bsdbofh> yep
[23:31:48] <bsdbofh> that's weird
[23:35:24] <djQuery> bsdbofh, no errors http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/yyB2N/6/
[23:36:28] <bsdbofh> hot damn.
[23:36:35] <bsdbofh> okay, so you just used one sortable
[23:36:39] <bsdbofh> and no draggable
[23:36:52] <djQuery> bsdbofh, toldya to look at the connected sortable demo
[23:37:09] <djQuery> bsdbofh, unfort there doesnt seem to be a clone option that way
[23:37:35] <bsdbofh> well, if it doesn't duplicate the item, then i don't need it.
[23:40:07] <bsdbofh> awesome. well, thanks for the help on that man. If you're ever in SFO, I'll buy you a beer! hehe
[23:40:27] <djQuery> bsdbofh, I accept paypal
[23:40:38] <djQuery> how much is a beer up there $100
[23:41:34] <rideh> damn thats slick
[23:41:58] <rideh> welp no reason i cant start doing agile now, i got a project board.
[23:42:02] <bsdbofh> hahaha. almost!
[23:42:13] <bsdbofh> farming expensive out here is what it is.
[23:42:23] <djQuery> bsdbofh, well it is by the time the strippers get to your wallet
[23:42:38] <bsdbofh> rideh: that's exactly what I'm building.
[23:42:54] <bsdbofh> and i'm pulling in the data via SOAP from our ticketing system
[23:43:03] <rideh> i'm certainly working on something that is a bit over my head.. ew soap?
[23:43:23] <bsdbofh> SOAP is an API for accessing data on another web service.
[23:43:30] <rideh> i understand, i'm more of a rest guy
[23:43:40] <bsdbofh> ah, i've never used it
[23:43:50] <djQuery> rideh, soap when done right is just better documented json
[23:43:50] <bsdbofh> in fact, this is the first time i've used soap
[23:44:58] <djQuery> used to support a call tracking app on asp.net and re-wrote the soap to be able to return jsonp
[23:46:18] <djQuery> danm thing only supported IE so had to write my own interface so that other browsers could access
[23:46:19] <djQuery> it
[23:46:23] <bsdbofh> HAH
[23:46:24] <bsdbofh> wow
[23:47:31] <djQuery> bsdbofh, well they were writting the app back when none of the browsers were going for standards just who could add the new cool feature
[23:47:44] <bsdbofh> ah. yeah I gotcha.
[23:48:48] <djQuery> <form src="xmlobject><input col="fld1" />
[23:50:32] <rideh> http://imgur.com/Rbrlupo   im thinking i might need to rethink how to do these filters
[23:51:58] <SoulShadow> i see your first problem already
[23:52:19] <SoulShadow> (osx)
[23:52:20] <rideh> SoulShadow: mac?
[23:52:23] <SoulShadow> :D
[23:52:25] <rideh> haha
[23:52:38] <SoulShadow> windows with linux in a vm = win
[23:52:43] <rideh> well, i went windows -> linux -> mac
[23:52:51] <SoulShadow> why go backwards? :o
[23:52:54] <rideh> i got nixception going on here
[23:53:04] <rideh> i run vagrant with vms for projects
[23:53:50] <rideh> i was running 2 companies and got tired of always having to fix some WPA_something or other or restarting cups or something
[23:55:46] <rideh> got the mac but still had terminal - some better gui defaults out of the box and i didnt have to dick around with iceweasel.  I really have enjoyed my time on osx, plists are dumb as are some other stuff but less headaches than windows or linux thus far.  though it wont last forever, i certainly feel the noose tightening
[23:58:42] <rideh> bsdbofh: is that project opensource? got a link to the repo?
[23:59:02] <bsdbofh> rideh, it most certainly will be. I don't have it up on github yet.
[23:59:37] <bsdbofh> but if you're interested in, i'll put it up on https://github.com/BCWilsonDotCom/ tomorrow
