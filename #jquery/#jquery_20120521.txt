[00:02:29] <nights> how can i at the same time fade and animate position?
[00:02:40] <nights> seem like they only happen after each other
[00:18:16] <martisj> is there a way to debug an ajax call, i.e. check what it sends before it sends it ?
[00:20:38] <ndss56> martisj: check what it sends on the server-side
[00:20:58] <systemfault> martisj: You can check what was sent with your favorite debug tools
[00:25:07] <Back2Basics> Anyone know how  to validate a webform then ajax post json data?  http://jsfiddle.net/K68M7/
[00:29:34] <vlad27aug> nights: you can animate position and opacity at the same time
[00:31:45] <martisj> systemfault: thanks but it's returning server error 500
[00:31:51] <martisj> and other weird thigns happne
[00:32:06] <systemfault> martisj: A 500 is a server error
[00:32:13] <martisj> systemfault: yeah
[00:32:16] <martisj> but how to debug :S(
[00:32:29] <systemfault> martisj: Ask the PHP guy...
[00:33:09] <systemfault> Tell him: Yo, there's a problem with your codeâ€¦. dude.
[00:34:36] <systemfault> martisj: Just saying that you cannot fix a 5xx error with javascript on the client side..
[00:34:39] <martisj> systemfault: well i do the php as well :)
[00:34:47] <martisj> hehehehee
[00:34:51] <martisj> at least try to
[00:35:30] <systemfault> martisj: There's nothing to help you with the message that is sent with the 500?
[00:35:59] <Back2Basics> in the javascript if you have a validate function which calls form.submit();  and another function that has  "$("#form_create_concept").submit({  "   then isn't that function then used to submit the form?
[00:36:02] <anli_> I am using jquery tabs and jquery.cookie.js to save the selected tab, how do I clear the cookie for one tab panel so it will go back to tab one?
[00:36:33] <systemfault> Back2Basics: .submit takes a function as its argument
[00:36:48] <systemfault> Back2Basics: (or no argument if you want to trigger a submit)
[00:37:19] <systemfault> anli_: Just make the cookie "expire"
[00:39:17] <anli_> I dont even know the name of the cookie, I have given a "name" to jquery tabs, but that can have been mangled after that
[00:40:00] <anli_> Hm, maybe all I need to do is to write a submit handler that changes tab to the first
[00:44:45] <Back2Basics> systemfault: so if I put an .ajax call in the form.submit() then it won't try for a normal post?
[00:45:05] <systemfault> Back2Basics: Depends how you do it..
[00:45:28] <Back2Basics> do I need form.preventDefault()
[00:45:44] <systemfault> $('#theForm').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault();   doTheAjaxTransactionhere; });
[00:45:58] <systemfault> Yeah, you need it
[00:47:20] <Martz_> good morning all, anyone knows if it is possible to make a jquery line that redirects the page to a div? I have this function that does stuff, and in the else i want either to redirect to a page, or stop the effect from the button that was clicked
[00:51:49] <BuffBuffBuff> How can i read the value of `<input type="file" name="attachment[]" id="attachment">`  using `alert($('input[name="attachment[][0]"]'));` where it shows `Object Object, but no value`?
[00:52:31] <Lucky--> wow. I cant believe i didnt think of this earlier for php, just serialize the form into a session variable to maintain view state.
[00:52:40] <systemfault> Fuck yeah: http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/05/21/google-chrome-overtakes-internet-explorer-as-the-webs-most-used-browser/
[00:52:44] <Back2Basics> systemfault: is the word "event" actually used or is that a generic for something that I need a specific item for?
[00:52:59] <Lucky--> systemfault: both fkin awesome, and bah big brother
[00:53:11] <systemfault> Back2Basics: You can name it "lol" if you wantâ€¦ but it's an event object
[00:53:22] <systemfault> Back2Basics: People usually use "e"
[00:53:45] <juha_> BuffBuffBuff: never use alert for debugging, that's why there is console
[00:54:11] <poppiez> is it possible to insert different markup at three different divs _at the same time_ to reduce reflows?
[00:54:26] <juha_> BuffBuffBuff: console.log($("input[name='attachment[][0]'));
[00:54:54] <BuffBuffBuff> juha_, returning `undefined`
[00:55:13] <BuffBuffBuff> juha_,  `console.log($("input[name='attachment[][0]').val() );`
[00:55:31] <juha_> BuffBuffBuff: does that selector exist?
[00:55:33] <systemfault> poppiez: Not really
[00:55:54] <BuffBuffBuff> juha_, yes i have `<input type="file" name="attachment[]" id="attachment">` twise
[00:55:54] <poppiez> systemfault: ok :)
[00:56:04] <systemfault> juha_: Not really
[00:56:35] <systemfault> :first exists though
[00:56:44] <systemfault> But there's an event better trick
[00:56:50] <juha_> BuffBuffBuff: try $("input") and then add more complexity to it
[00:57:05] <juha_> systemfault: ?
[00:57:16] <juha_> systemfault: did you mean that for someone else?
[00:57:30] <systemfault> If you want to see the value of a nodeâ€¦ select it in the inspector then it becomes $0 inside the console
[00:57:55] <juha_> BuffBuffBuff: also, i have a typo on my example, i'll give you thousand internets if you can find it
[00:58:46] <systemfault> OMG! That's a lot of internetz
[00:59:57] <juha_> yeah, i always keep extra intertubes with me
[01:01:29] <BuffBuffBuff> juha_, both way `$("input").val()` or `$("input[name='attachment[]']").val()` or `$("input[name='attachment[][0]']").val()` output: undefined
[01:02:09] <systemfault> BuffBuffBuff: Write a testcase then.
[01:02:14] <systemfault> We'll try to help.
[01:03:05] <juha_> BuffBuffBuff: are you calling .val() after you've added some content to the input or before?
[01:03:19] <BuffBuffBuff> YES - juha_
[01:04:31] <juha_> yes for after or before? :D
[01:05:03] <BuffBuffBuff> AFTER - juha_
[01:05:41] <juha_> BuffBuffBuff: ok weird, try console.log($("input")); to see if you get anything
[01:08:06] <poppiez> what's the technique called where images don't load from top to bottom but load right away but is blurry initially?
[01:09:03] <systemfault> progressive/interlaced image loading?
[01:09:39] <ndss56> systemfault: how you implement that?
[01:10:02] <systemfault> ndss56: Not sure.. I think you must save the image that way..
[01:10:20] <poppiez> systemfault: thx :)
[01:10:43] <systemfault> IIRC, people don't often do that because it creates bigger images.
[01:11:02] <systemfault> Like 20/25% bigger
[01:11:30] <ndss56> systemfault: facebook does it.
[01:11:37] <poppiez> systemfault: yeah, that's a huge downside
[01:11:48] <systemfault> ndss56: Not sure what it's supposed to mean..
[01:12:10] <ndss56> systemfault: so basically you need a lower-grade duplicate copy.
[01:12:10] <systemfault> ndss56: Is facebook a new god or something?
[01:12:15] <systemfault> Ahhhh
[01:12:53] <ndss56> systemfault: yeh kinda like a god i suppose.
[01:13:48] <poppiez> interwebz god
[01:13:54] <Back2Basics> when do you use commas and when do you use semi-colons to end statements?
[01:14:09] <systemfault> Back2Basics: You always use semi-colons..
[01:14:26] <systemfault> Back2Basics: Where have you seen that statements end with commas?
[01:14:40] <ndss56> Back2Basics: yes you always end statements with a comma o_0
[01:14:48] <systemfault> wut?
[01:30:39] <cheesypoof20> I'm trying to add up the values of a few text inputs. What's the correct way to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/4nKS9/
[01:31:36] <Dr-Bombay> grr my scroll got stuck again
[01:35:50] <Dr-Bombay> chees: first, check your browser's errors and warnings. Second, don't just assume that a function happens to return what you would like it to return. http://jsfiddle.net/4nKS9/2/
[01:39:58] <cheesypoof20> Awesome thanks, I'm new to javascript. What do you mean by your 'assumption' suggestion?
[01:42:28] <antnash> Hey guys. I'm trying to turn an event handler off, but it's not working, the event still fires. Where am I going wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/JzHYH/10/
[01:45:19] <Lucky--> antnash: event.preventDefault();
[01:45:56] <systemfault> Perhaps even .stopPropagation();
[01:47:05] <Lucky--> Any of you guys got/know of a web service that provides job titles and/or companies?
[01:47:44] <NodeX> anyone know off hand the jquery method to get multiple selected values from a <select multiple="multiple"> ?
[01:47:49] <antnash> So I should do $(document).on('click', '.editor', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); ?
[01:48:59] <antnash> That would be a no, as it didn't work.
[01:49:22] <antnash> By the way, I'm trying to turn off an event handler that I added.
[01:56:52] <systemfault> antnash: Can't  you use .off?
[01:57:50] <antnash> systemdefault, That's what I was trying. If you have a look at the fiddle, it's there but I'm guessing I'm not using it right
[02:00:26] <Milos> A bit of a weird one.
[02:01:08] <Milos> My response.responseText contains RAW CONTENT for the data I need to initiate a download for. How do I manipulate this variable to make the browser treat it as content from a file needing to be downloaded?
[02:02:04] <systemfault> Milos: Perhaps by setting the proper HTTP header
[02:02:14] <Milos> systemfault, I did.
[02:02:18] <systemfault> "Content-Disposition"
[02:02:19] <Milos> systemfault, it's ajax. The headers don't matter
[02:02:20] <systemfault> Ah?
[02:02:53] <Milos> It does what I want if I request the file like you would without ajax, but I need to use ajax.
[02:03:01] <Milos> Hence my responseText contains the data.
[02:03:14] <antnash> Essentially what I'm trying to do is stop the tr click registering if you click on a child text input
[02:04:05] <systemfault> Milos: I don'T think you can :'(
[02:04:14] <Milos> D:
[02:04:34] <systemfault> Milos: You could probably fake it with some kind of iframe transport
[02:04:46] <peiper> som1 expierienced with Chosen-select boxes ? i have an issue making 2 dependent selects with ajax >_>
[02:07:18] <D4> Hello, I'm running into a very odd problem with IE7; it breaks js completely due to: http://jsfiddle.net/gpAGJ/ <-- I need to fix that statement as, now, it's :: backgroundPosition = $this.css('background-position').split(' '),
[02:07:52] <D4> question is, how? What I've got there produces the same error as previously, can I check against $this or should I do $(this) ? .. : ''; etc?
[02:08:04] <duellsy> hey all
[02:08:21] <D4> IE complains about not being able to use split whereas the object is null or not defined -- nonexistant
[02:09:29] <D4> I don't want it to run the .split() if 'this' is null or undefined really to go around the IE7 bug
[02:09:48] <nFFF> D4, $(this) will never be null in that example, .each won't get run on an empty jquery set :|
[02:10:32] <whateverb> why I cant set every rows lowest 'ul' height to every 'ul' http://jsfiddle.net/2qF6w/21/
[02:10:38] <peiper> D4 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6422355/javascript-split-function-not-working-in-ie
[02:10:39] <D4> Well, that particular line is what is causing IE7 to disable all JS as it complains about that being null/undefined
[02:11:32] <nFFF> D4, which line is, $this = $(this); console.log($this);
[02:11:41] <nFFF> check your console, $this won't be null
[02:11:48] <peiper> whateverb, youre mixxing html-heigth with css-heigth use jquery .css() instead of .heigth
[02:12:01] <systemfault> It's height :P
[02:12:12] <peiper> i always fail at the spelling omfg XD
[02:13:28] <D4> nFFF » You are right, it isn't null, they're all set. But for some reason, for some "each" element it is null in IE7, and if I move the lines around some IE still complains specifically about that line with split()
[02:13:42] <D4> peiper » I've read the posts but I'm not sure what you're getting at :)
[02:13:43] <whateverb> peiper, this doesnt work also: http://jsfiddle.net/2qF6w/22/
[02:14:37] <D4> So the "statement" i've got going actually runs since they're always set (i get that), but I really wonder why it says null/undefined. Is it perhaps because I'm using .split(' '); ?
[02:15:43] <nFFF> D4, ok, so console.log($this.css('background-position'))
[02:16:08] <nFFF> make sure that the css property exists on the current element
[02:16:55] <nFFF>  backgroundPosition = $this ? $this.css('background-position').split(' ') : '', // this is redundant, as $this will always exist within each methods callback
[02:17:23] <D4> nFFF » Yeah, hence the question what to do :)) So, they're all set. I get values for each
[02:17:32] <peiper> whateverb, you want to give every ul the heigth of the lowest ul right?
[02:17:43] <nFFF> D4, does console.log($this.css('background-position')) return anything?
[02:17:53] <D4> but IE still says: "SCRIPT5007: Unable to get value of the property 'split': object is null or undefined"
[02:17:56] <whateverb> yes, and separately per $".row"
[02:18:04] <globe_tmp> hi
[02:18:07] <D4> nFFF » Yeah, what I meant just now - I get background position values for each
[02:18:08] <whateverb> per div with class row
[02:18:16] <D4> 50% 10px, 50% 0, etc
[02:18:17] <globe_tmp> guys anybody could give me a little help with this http://pastie.org/3943786
[02:18:46] <globe_tmp> i can get the alert with the data result to print
[02:20:48] <D4> Oh, nFFF - I have to use background-position-x/y: in IE7 :/
[02:21:21] <peiper> whateverb, you have multiple ul's in 1 div so i guess you need to .each trough all ul's and not just the first one
[02:21:43] <peiper> in the html output you see in the 2nd row the first ul of "ONE"'s is working
[02:21:46] <nFFF> :D
[02:22:46] <whateverb> peiper, it gives height:0px to every ul
[02:23:17] <whateverb> so it iterates through all 'ul's
[02:23:49] <peiper> you haven't set any heigth thats why its 0
[02:24:24] <whateverb> here it works for MAX height: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2qF6w/17/
[02:24:31] <whateverb> but I need same thing for MIN height
[02:24:44] <D4> Are there conditional script comments to target IE7? I.e. I'd like to disable a few snippets of JS if the user is running IE7
[02:25:22] <Lucky--> can any of you guys recommend a like "marquee" popup that auto moves left to right for a progress bar
[02:25:31] <Lucky--> but doesnt indicate actual numeric values
[02:25:35] <Lucky--> just that its doing something
[02:25:50] <whateverb> D4, you can put put javascript between <!--[if IE 7]><![endif]-->
[02:26:45] <nFFF> D4, why care about ie 7 :D
[02:27:10] <D4> I'm asking myself the same question, but there's just this thing bugging out in IE7 so I'm like "gaah, it's so close" :p
[02:27:28] <nFFF> seriously fuck ie7 :|
[02:27:35] <nFFF> its about 2% of the internet
[02:27:36] <D4> So now I'll disable this for IE7 instead. Or, try to.
[02:27:41] <nFFF> and the 2% you dont care about
[02:27:43] <Lucky--> nFFF: yea my sentiments exactly
[02:28:40] <whateverb> peiper, I dont get where it gets 0px for every 'ul' because with max height it works perfectly
[02:28:50] <peiper> i see its kinda weird
[02:34:04] <D4> whateverb » Is it possible to do <!--[if !IE 7]> --> <script....> <!-- <![endif]--> using the version in there?
[02:35:02] <nisseni> I have a jquery virtual keyboard which I want to combine with .change() - I can't get it to work, anyone with experience from this?
[02:35:12] <whateverb> D4, http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html
[02:35:34] <D4> whateverb » That's where I'm looking, but it doesn't say if I can use version in there or not, seems I can't
[02:36:49] <whateverb> D4, use <!--[if gt IE 7]> to target greater browser than IE7
[02:37:22] <D4> whateverb » yes but that would run stuff within for IE browsers > 7, but not for the other browsers - right?
[02:38:29] <D4> ah I'll combine that with !IE to be more specific, ty
[02:43:05] <BuffBuffBuff> juha_, not working https://gist.github.com/2761536
[02:44:35] <whateverb> can someone look through my script to give every ul the heigth of the lowest ul right in each $('.row') - http://jsfiddle.net/2qF6w/23/
[02:47:01] <antnash> Hey guys. Why does this not work?
[02:47:04] <antnash> function getList() { $.get('list/xhrList', function(o) { return o; }, 'json');}       var list = getList();
[02:48:55] <BuffBuffBuff> https://gist.github.com/2761536 - Why its not working is it jQuery BUG or Html (screwed) BUG?
[02:50:09] <DaveJ|UK> I'm happily using the jQuery UI helper styles such as ui-state-error on the theme page: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[02:50:19] <DaveJ|UK> But does anyone else think the mark up is excessive?
[02:50:53] <DaveJ|UK> you have 3 block level elements to display something then could be done in 1
[02:51:00] <DaveJ|UK> then=that
[02:51:50] <Whirl3d> i certainly think it's excessive, but then again I don't know anything better off hand..
[02:55:01] <DaveJ|UK> the main thing i dont understand is why they nest a span inside a div for the icon. why don't they just apply the icon to the outer div as a background and add some padding?
[02:56:09] <Haprog> because the icon can be in the middle of text
[02:56:13] <Haprog> so it flows with the text
[02:56:18] <Whirl3d> perhaps it has to do with the styling of the icons. They are likely applying a background image to the div, so the icon has to sit on top of that
[02:56:39] <DaveJ|UK> mmm
[02:56:55] <DaveJ|UK> why would you ever want an icon in the middle of text?
[02:57:12] <Whirl3d> lots of times.  Like next to a phone number
[02:57:18] <Haprog> Why not? Though usually it's just in the beginning or end in case of a button for example
[02:57:40] <globe_tmp> guys anybody could give me a little help with this http://pastie.org/3943786
[02:57:45] <antnash> Hey Whirl3d, any reason this doesn't work...   var list = $.get('list/xhrList', function(o) { return o; }, 'json');
[02:58:46] <Whirl3d> antnash, I wish I could help you, but I haven't had occasion to use .get or JSON
[02:59:30] <NoReGreT> is there a way to display the content of a json object? when i use console.log() i only see [object] which is not useful.. any ideas ?
[02:59:54] <antnash> Whirl3d: I think I might know. Is there some way I can only assign jobList to that after the content has been retrieved?
[03:00:51] <Whirl3d> NoReGreT, have you tried just loggin the JSON object alone ---nothing else in the log()..
[03:01:23] <NoReGreT> Whirl3d: i don't get it, what do you mean
[03:02:04] <Whirl3d> for a while, I was making a stupid mistake where I would do :  console.log("this is my jSON:"+myJSON)
[03:02:18] <Whirl3d> and I would get "this is my object object"
[03:02:34] <NoReGreT> yeah, that would be the output of that
[03:02:42] <Lucky--> Is there an easier way guys then doing this? lol WAY too much typing
[03:02:43] <Lucky--> http://www.pastie.org/private/pvzedo0xlofbdwvcbuisw http://www.pastie.org/private/1m9a8vp7islapoic8xw
[03:02:43] <Whirl3d> but console.log(myJSON) would return the actual object
[03:02:47] <NoReGreT> you have to $.each in order to get results
[03:02:52] <NoReGreT> ah
[03:03:22] <NoReGreT> Whirl3d: cool, taht worked out
[03:03:32] <Whirl3d> also, console.log("this is my json object",myobj)
[03:03:35] <Whirl3d> works too
[03:03:35] <NoReGreT> Whirl3d: but i don't get it, why would adding strings change that..
[03:03:42] <NoReGreT> i see
[03:03:50] <NoReGreT> it gets casted to a string then
[03:03:55] <Whirl3d> right
[03:04:00] <NoReGreT> cool
[03:04:06] <Whirl3d> but pass log an array and it works
[03:06:27] <poppiez> how do I find both img and div tags? $('body').find('img div')
[03:06:56] <Whirl3d> poppiez, $("div, img")
[03:07:12] <poppiez> Whirl3d: thx! :)
[03:07:17] <Whirl3d> np
[03:09:22] <antnash> Whirl3d, How would I just delay for 500ms?
[03:09:47] <Whirl3d> setTimeout(func, 500)
[03:10:45] <i256> hello
[03:11:01] <i256> in this example http://ididitmyway.heroku.com/past/2011/2/27/ajax_in_sinatra/
[03:11:08] <globe_tmp> guys i got this code http://pastie.org/3943980  and the second alert doesn't succeed
[03:11:32] <i256> wha i can read form data from ajax?
[03:14:27] <mi6_x3m> hello what is wrong with selector "#wheel + :image"
[03:14:37] <mi6_x3m> I want to select the first image inside a #wheel div
[03:16:53] <Whirl3d> $("#wheel>img").first()  ?
[03:17:18] <Whirl3d> $("#wheel img:first") ?
[03:18:07] <i256> What I can change data to send and receiwe <form <input text? http://dark-code.bulix.org/a5vy12-81529
[03:18:29] <i256> function(data +word:) ?
[03:18:49] <Whirl3d> the first one assumes that img is a direct child of #wheel, whereas the second one grabs the first image as any descendant
[03:19:31] <DaveJ|UK> Is there a de facto standard WYSIWYG textarea html editor control?
[03:19:36] <DaveJ|UK> for jquery
[03:19:49] <Whirl3d> ive heard tinymce works.
[03:19:50] <DaveJ|UK> im using TinyMCE but it seems a little bloated for what i need
[03:20:32] <peiper> hi i want to use $.get() in an .change event of a select box when i set the selector of change to the id it works when i put it to "select[name='xxx']" it wont execute the request... any ideas?
[03:22:16] <Whirl3d> peiper, can you create a jsfiddle to reproduce the problem?
[03:22:23] <peiper> yep, just a second
[03:22:41] <mi6_x3m> Whirl3d: both don't work
[03:23:25] <Whirl3d> m16_x3m, then you are gonna have to make a fiddle of it so show the problem
[03:23:59] <mi6_x3m> guess so :)
[03:24:41] <whateverb> Whirl3d, can you look at my script to give every ul the heigth of the lowest ul right in each $('.row') - http://jsfiddle.net/2qF6w/23/
[03:25:41] <whateverb> height*
[03:28:21] <peiper> Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/5FUVk/
[03:28:35] <peiper> as you can see its not executing any requests (using firebug)
[03:28:46] <peiper> but when u change select[name.... to #s1 it works
[03:30:34] <Whirl3d> whateverb, change your UL css to display:"table"
[03:31:20] <Whirl3d> what is "chosen"
[03:31:38] <peiper> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[03:31:57] <peiper> its a jquery plugin for select's
[03:33:13] <Whirl3d> peiper, same domain?
[03:33:20] <peiper> jup
[03:33:27] <peiper> its just a subdir
[03:33:50] <peiper> but the request isnt even executed
[03:34:44] <Whirl3d> $(this).val().length...? perhaps just $(this).val()
[03:35:36] <Whirl3d> that'll do it
[03:35:47] <peiper> wow
[03:35:48] <peiper> thanks!
[03:35:55] <Whirl3d> np
[03:38:32] <Whirl3d> well, I am off to get my brain analyzed...it appears my recent MRI indicates some "abnormalities" that require immediate attention...wish me luck.LOL

[04:29:19] <LukeB> Hi
[04:30:03] <LukeB> Anyone else experiencing download issues with the Zip on the UI themeroller - I'm just getting the first 60-odd-kb of the zips?
[04:30:24] <LukeB> Repeatable on OSX, wIndows and multiple machines at one site.
[04:31:09] <LukeB> Any admins about?
[04:31:56] <LukeB> I'd even settle for a static of SouthStreet for 1.8 - I could customise from that.
[04:33:15] <LukeB> Hey guys could you try downloading SouthStreet theme from: http://jqueryui.com/download/?themeParams=%3Fctl%3Dthemeroller - I want to rule out our site connection.
[04:34:48] <LukeB> It's really odd, the download is reporting a larger size, but is giving up at around 69kb. - can anyone else confirm?
[04:36:04] <LukeB> Ok, I'm going to grab the standard themes from the CDN and manually customise - anyone else been able to reproduce this error with the theme-roller?
[04:36:13] <Zhy> LukeB
[04:36:15] <Zhy> same here
[04:36:20] <LukeB> thanks Zhy
[04:36:24] <Zhy> and on top: no themes are displayed for me in the themeroller
[04:36:58] <Zhy> np :)
[04:38:35] <LukeB> Ok - anyone who needs themes in a hurry while this problem persists - the CDN link is: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/south-street/jquery-ui.css
[04:39:04] <LukeB> Good ol stack-overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/820412/downloading-jquery-css-from-googles-cdn
[04:39:55] <LukeB> Anyone know - who I should talk to about getting the theme-roller looked at?
[04:42:12] <jeffsmykil> Why is it so hard for QA to wait to QA things until they are released to QA
[04:42:25] * jeffsmykil smashes head on needless bug reports
[04:42:25] <LukeB> if it's not fixed itself by 5gmt - I'll file a http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[04:42:51] <Zhy> either that or the forum I'd say, LukeB
[04:43:38] <Womkes> Any idea where I can find the plugins site/listing
[04:43:39] <LukeB> cheers Zhy - I can't complain if I don't get involved. I'm very happy with jq+ui
[04:43:41] <Womkes> it is down
[04:43:45] <Womkes> and the archive is down also
[04:45:10] <LukeB> Thanks for the update Womkes - is there a better place for me to look for the status of such things rather than asking on here?
[04:46:14] <LukeB> thanks jeffsmykil
[04:46:19] <Womkes> ...
[04:47:10] <jeffsmykil> why am I being thanked lol
[04:47:14] <jeffsmykil> I just bitched about QA lol
[04:47:47] <LukeB> it wouldn't be a community without contributions - even grumpy ones count :-)
[04:48:18] <jeffsmykil> I also hate when they combine unrelated bugs fwiw
[04:48:27] <xec_> Womkes got thanked too, for bitching about the plugins site being down
[04:48:53] <xec_> what should i bitch about to get some recognition, i wonder? :D
[04:49:03] <Womkes> bitching
[04:49:05] <Womkes> shut up man
[04:49:12] <Womkes> just asking where I might find info
[04:49:14] <xec_> hehe no offence
[04:49:25] <xec_> it was meant as a joke
[04:49:54] <Womkes> Well, IRC is generally full of people who should have been cops
[04:50:01] <LukeB> excuse me good people, I must away to bacon sandwiches and latte - have a good one.
[04:50:12] <xec_> cops? in what sense
[04:51:15] * jeffsmykil completely just guessed the IE 7 machines login
[04:51:40] * jeffsmykil bows
[04:52:59] <jeffsmykil> The other day I got a bug from QA that in the comments all it said was "Cock Inspection"
[04:53:33] <Womkes> In the sense that it is full of people that satisfaction out of telling people off and talking down to them
[04:53:42] <pachet> bet there were some high fives and james spader sunglass tilts in QA over that one
[04:53:45] <Womkes> especially in tech channels
[04:54:11] <jeffsmykil> pachet they meant "Clock inspection"
[04:54:24] <jeffsmykil> whcih I was supposed to decipher as "The inspection page is not loading"
[04:54:28] <pachet> that's what they want you to think!
[04:55:54] <jeffsmykil> pachet: it was a woman
[04:56:02] <jeffsmykil> and a highschool intern at that
[04:56:24] <pachet> !
[04:57:15] <jeffsmykil> what you don't hire hs internes to qa your app?
[04:57:41] <xec_> Womkes: haha, i guess you're right. for what it's worth i really did not mean to offend you, i just found it funny how that luke guy suddenly was thanking everyone active on the channel out of nowhere ;)
[04:58:17] <Womkes> Well ok then, my bad
[04:58:30] <Womkes> just had some bad experiences recently in ##php
[04:58:36] <pachet> speak not its name
[04:58:59] <jeffsmykil> of course im joking about all of this, non of it is actually true
[04:59:24] <Womkes> Asked a valid question imo and some guy whent on a full page tirade on how I was asking it in the wrong channel
[04:59:57] <pachet> every channel is the wrong channel for people who dont want to be a help
[05:05:25] <Bala> in html5 can i access class name to one html to another html
[05:08:47] <jeffsmykil> Bala I'm not sure what you are asking
[05:09:05] <ill1cit> must read between the lines
[05:13:09] <Bala> i have audio src in child page which i need to access from main shell,how can i do that
[05:15:30] <Bala> i have audio src in child page which i need to access from main shell,how can i do that using javascript or jquery
[05:17:28] <Sulaiman> Greetings
[05:18:27] <MariusKarthaus> How do I differ between a click on some text and the click the results after some text is selected?
[05:20:24] <Sulaiman> I have run into a problem, my form doesn't work if I use jquery.mobile, I have added data-ajax="false" to the form element, but $_POST['submit'] doesn't hold any value. It works if I comment out the js reference to the script
[05:21:05] <Sulaiman> the code is using version 1.0a2
[05:21:15] <D4> backgroundPosition = $this.css('background-position').split(' '), <-- any idea how I can set the backgroundPosition without using split()?
[05:25:11] <sbarcteam> hi
[05:29:50] <pachet> D4: what's wrong with split :[
[05:30:21] <D4> pachet » Well, not split() itself but since IE7 and 8 can't seem to handle 'undefined', it breaks JS completely
[05:30:52] <D4> Seems to be because IE7/8 doesn't understand background-position, only background-position-x/y
[05:32:27] <pachet> D4: yeah, sucks but that's the game
[05:32:52] <D4> Yeah so the question is how I'd manage to fix it so it won't break JS in IE7/8 ;p
[05:33:58] <pachet> D4: http://joncom.be/code/jquery-css-background-position/
[05:46:05] <JillesCode> Hey guys, I have a button, and an onclick animate, but when you click the button 6x in a second (or something like that) my whole script/handle crashes.. How can I prevent this?
[05:47:17] <aquatix> JillesCode: maybe disable the button for a bit?
[05:47:36] <aquatix> or have a boolean 'animating' that's true until it's finished
[05:47:44] <aquatix> and your script checks on that
[05:48:34] <JillesCode> aquatix: mhmm good idea!
[05:50:07] <aquatix> JillesCode: yw :)
[05:55:05] <zim> Hi all. I am about to do some stuff using .parent. In the past I have written stuff only to find there is a better/newer function etc. .parent is it the one to use?
[05:56:10] <shoky_> if you're looking for the parent, use .parent
[05:58:44] <zim> ty
[05:58:48] <D4> pachet » Okay, so that would get the position and unit in an object, but still it's setting the position that's not working correctly -- this is where I'm at :: http://jsfiddle.net/j86ju/
[05:59:22] <D4> I need to somehow break the 'else' returned p into p.split(' '); but that doesn't work for some reason
[06:03:26] <xec_> zim: depending on what exactly you're doing, maybe .closest() is an option (rather than chaining three .parent() calls or something)
[06:05:19] <zim> xec_: I am looking at both TY just in the past I have done stuff with things like .live and was pointed at .on so was just making sure that there was no better .foo
[06:07:13] <Famic> zim: http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[06:07:22] <nFFF> D4, why not just do bgpos().split(' ') and move on ? :>
[06:08:16] <zim> Famic: more to the point .live will be deprecated
[06:08:49] <Famic> zim: that is in the article with other useful infos :p
[06:09:12] <zim> Sorry did not read that far as I am using .on
[06:12:54] <Jagan_> hi
[06:13:48] <Jagan_> how to show loading image when i call ajax?
[06:15:08] <NoReGreT> how i can if a json object is empty ?
[06:16:08] <xec_> Jagan_: display it before you do the ajax and hide it in the callback?
[06:16:22] <xec_> NoReGreT: say what?
[06:16:30] <_Nike_> $('#eng').click(function () {
[06:16:30] <_Nike_> $.cookie("Lang", "1", { expires: 7, path: '/' });
[06:16:36] <_Nike_> why don't set the cookie ?
[06:17:05] <NoReGreT> xec_: how can I check if a json object is empty ?
[06:17:30] <NoReGreT> xec_: just == "" ?
[06:17:40] <_Nike_> anyone?
[06:18:46] <xec_> NoReGreT: if your "json" is a string? sure
[06:19:06] <xec_> well, do === in that case
[06:19:18] <NoReGreT> xec_: what if not a string ?
[06:19:55] <Jagan_> xec_ , shoul i use any animated imgae or normal image is enough?
[06:20:03] <xec_> Jagan_: up to you
[06:20:45] <xec_> Jagan_: http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/ is pretty nice for loading
[06:21:10] <xec_> NoReGreT: then what is it
[06:21:17] <xec_> NoReGreT: undefined?
[06:21:23] <NoReGreT> xec_: e.g. i have this http://pastie.org/3944686
[06:21:47] <NoReGreT> xec_: that json is the current value in the loop
[06:22:18] <NoReGreT> xec_: there, i want to check if Tag is empty or not
[06:22:36] <Jagan_> thanks xec, i wil try
[06:23:15] <D4> http://jsfiddle.net/j86ju/1/ <-- how do I return the var 'a' as an array instead of making it an object as it is now, having to access pos.arr ?
[06:23:22] <xec_> NoReGreT: that snippet is incomplete? what is d?
[06:24:00] <NoReGreT> xec_: yes it's not, d.data should be a list of the same json string
[06:24:15] <xec_> NoReGreT: anyway, Tag looks to be an array, you could just check its length
[06:24:42] <NoReGreT> so val.Tag.length ?
[06:26:45] <D4> Anyone able to take a look? :)
[06:28:18] <xec_> NoReGreT: something like that
[06:29:16] <xec_> D4: a *is* an array already?
[06:29:18] <johnkpaul> D4: return a;
[06:29:45] <D4> xec_ yes, and instead of doing .bgPos().arr i'd simply like to do bgPos()
[06:29:51] <D4> johnkpaul » That gives me an exception atm
[06:30:13] <xec_> return a; was my first thought too :P whats the error
[06:30:26] <johnkpaul> D4: that's because you need to change your console.log
[06:30:27] <zim> Ok new Q. Combining objects. http://jsfiddle.net/kzMB9/

[06:32:29] <iconnect> I have a chat system inplace that uses NODE JS, and the only problem i have is when <script> alert(''test"); </script> is done , it acutally runs it rather display plain text. Any ideas?
[06:32:48] <iconnect> is inserted *
[06:33:36] <xec_> isn't there a node.js channel?
[06:33:53] <johnkpaul> yes, #node.js, but that's not really a node question,
[06:33:55] <iconnect> yah but its not really node.js related , it kinda is
[06:34:00] <johnkpaul> iconnect: you need to escape your html
[06:34:19] <iconnect> any easy way to detect so i can escape it?
[06:35:32] <xec_> oh, sorry

[06:36:13] <johnkpaul> np, have fun
[06:36:53] <xec_> zim: not sure, but maybe $.extend() could do the job?

[07:02:53] <Tobsn> lol, missed it ;)
[07:22:44] <tplaner_> so I'm running into an issue with draggable on items which are scaled using css transform -- they're not dragging properly -- there are some tickets open about it which claim it has been fixed in newer versions of jquery-ui, I'm running the latest stableâ€¦am I missing something?
[07:24:37] <ynniv_> has anyone seen mobile safari delay innerHTML updates until the next touch event?
[07:24:57] <Lavezzi91> |link
[07:31:14] <tplaner_> actually my issue is a little more complex then that, its a child of a scaled item that I'm dragging -- here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/DMG4R/
[07:35:19] <ShishKabab> The JQuery UI download is not working for me (download button to the right). In Opera I get a download error, in Firfox I get an empty zip file. Anyone else having this problem?
[07:36:01] <johnkpaul> ShishKabab: other's have reported the same issue here earlier today
[07:36:05] <johnkpaul> others*
[07:36:13] <johnkpaul> I don't know more, but you're not the only one
[07:36:33] <j0rd> anyone know what jquery/jjqui use for automated unit testing with regards to speed
[07:37:12] <j0rd> i  found jquery.simulate.js
[07:37:16] <ShishKabab> johnkpaul: Ok, so at least you know know about it. Do you know of any mirrors I could use?
[07:37:20] <j0rd> anything else I should be looking at?
[07:37:34] <johnkpaul> the google ajax api cdn has it I believe
[07:37:49] <ShishKabab> Ok, thank you!
[07:39:04] <fusion27> I've got a JavaScript object (http://pastie.org/3944993) and I want to wipe out the entry it has for value: "0289f93ffc1e80b04428d5086b1598b7", how do I do that?
[07:40:03] <johnkpaul> !mdn array.splice @ fusion27
[07:40:20] <johnkpaul> fusion27: you have to search the array for the index of the object that you want to remove
[07:40:26] <johnkpaul> and then use array.splice to remove that index
[07:41:30] <fusion27> $.inArray('0289f93ffc1e80b04428d5086b1598b7', groups) is returning a -1
[07:41:52] <johnkpaul> fusion27: that's not how inArray works, you need to write a custom searching function
[07:42:15] <fusion27> iterate over the object until I get a hit then splice?
[07:42:59] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's one way
[07:44:13] <johnkpaul> fusion27: you could also $.filter
[07:44:40] <fusion27> johnkpaul: yeah, I'd love to do this as a jQuery one-liner
[07:45:00] <johnkpaul> :) but why fusion27? beause it's the cool thing to do?
[07:45:14] <chop> say you have "success: function(data)", how do you get the <img> elements from the variable data?
[07:45:20] <fusion27> I want more people to like me :D
[07:45:39] <johnkpaul> fusion27: people will like you based on how uickly they understand your code in the future, not whether or not you use jquery
[07:45:48] <johnkpaul> not that I disagree with your plans
[07:45:58] <johnkpaul> look into $.filter(obj, function(){return boolean;}
[07:46:27] <johnkpaul> chop: data is aan html string?
[07:46:32] <chop> json
[07:46:35] <chop> hmm.
[07:46:38] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: what is the best method for converting time from utc for a situation where the database is in another time zone?  Is it to have the server convert using the client's timezone, or is it to convert client side?
[07:46:38] <danzik17> fusion27: or better yet, add underscore.js into the mix and use their filter/reject methods since it will use native if available.  http://underscorejs.org/#reject
[07:46:42] <johnkpaul> then there are no <img> elements, chop
[07:46:58] <chop> no it's xhtml
[07:47:10] <johnkpaul> chop: then $(data).find("img")
[07:47:17] <KatelyNix> Hi.  I'm trying to force redraw the jQuery-generated content at change of browser viewport size for a 'responsive'.  As I change browser size, the jQuery object's width correctly scales, but the object's fails to redraw to scale.
[07:47:18] <KatelyNix> My simple attempt to fix this -- using "(window).resize(function(){ ... }).resize();" -> e.g., adding lines 161-164 @ http://pastebin.com/us0QAnGw -- doesn't cause any redraw-on-resize at all.  Is my code or approach wrong?
[07:47:34] <chop> johnkpaul: okay. a lot nicer than getelementsbytagname lol
[07:47:52] <chop> what about $(data img)?
[07:48:05] <johnkpaul> chop: that's a syntax error
[07:48:31] <KatelyNix> oops. that's "responsive site" ...
[07:48:45] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: i would probably try to avoid having to do the time conversion on the client side unless there's absolutely no way around it
[07:48:56] <ajpiano> i'd get the client's offset on the server and serve back all the times adjusted
[07:49:45] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: Is there a reasoning behind this that I can bring to my co-workers so they don't behead me
[07:49:58] <johnkpaul> KatelyNix: is that code not being executed when the window is resized?
[07:50:19] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: is the app a single page app where all the data is being rendered on the client
[07:50:25] <coldhead> jeffsmykil: http://www.amnesty.org.au/adp/
[07:50:27] <ajpiano> or are there pages that are rendered on the server...
[07:50:27] <subdesign> hi, can I use php in javascript script tag? i have an if statement in js
[07:50:44] <chilversc_> jeffsmykil: the browser doesn't really make any information available about the local timezone unfortunatly, or any other globalization settings for that matter
[07:50:47] <jeffsmykil> mostly client side via ajax calls
[07:51:24] <jeffsmykil> chilversc not in the http header?
[07:51:39] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: but it is a complex web app
[07:51:45] <jeffsmykil> lots of data being sent back and forth
[07:51:55] <johnkpaul> chilversc_: that's not true
[07:52:05] <johnkpaul> isn't there a .getTimezone() on dates?
[07:52:08] <KatelyNix> johnkpaul: The overall width of the div container wrapping the jQuery object DOES scale -- iiuc, that's simply CSS width set to "width: 98%" working as intended.  The content of the jQuery object, the accorion in this case, fails to redraw to the new container width -- until I page-refresh.  So, i think the right answer to your question is: no, it isn't.
[07:52:12] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: no
[07:52:33] <ajpiano> there's getTimezoneOffset
[07:52:34] <ajpiano> :p
[07:52:36] <johnkpaul> oh really?  I thought there was some way to get the timezone
[07:52:37] <johnkpaul> ah
[07:52:38] <chilversc_> johnkpaul: they really don't, for instance, in windows I can set my short date pattern, but no browser can read that
[07:52:39] <johnkpaul> ha, I was close
[07:52:46] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: but DST is an issue
[07:53:04] <chilversc_> johnkpaul: and a timezone offset won't tell you the country so you still don't know how to render the date
[07:53:13] <johnkpaul> ah, right, it's still closer than nothing
[07:53:16] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: so if we did do the conversion server side, how would it know the time zone?
[07:53:18] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: it's also doable on the client side.  either way you're gonna have to wrap every time you display a time with a call to normalise
[07:53:21] <johnkpaul> yes, locale is a different problem, chilversc_
[07:53:23] <danzik17> what about just converting the date to UTC and getting the unix ticks?  then just to new Date( ticks ) client side
[07:53:44] <chilversc_> johnkpaul: though try to keep all text conversion to the same place, ie format all on the server, or all on the client or it gets even weider
[07:53:50] <johnkpaul> KatelyNix: I don't see where in your code your telling the accordion to resize
[07:53:59] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: i've seen stuff done where you use JS to figure out the timezone offset and then save that to the server for the current user
[07:54:04] <ajpiano> and then serve everything back adjusted
[07:54:14] <chilversc_> johnkpaul: unless you use a date library that lets you specify the exact format to use
[07:54:36] <jeffsmykil> wouldn't the timezone offset change based on DST?
[07:54:42] <KatelyNix> johnkpaul: [07:47] <KatelyNix> My simple attempt to fix this -- using "(window).resize(function(){ ... }).resize();" -> e.g., adding lines 161-164 @ http://pastebin.com/us0QAnGw
[07:55:31] <johnkpaul> KatelyNix: yes, I see those lines, is that supposed to change the size of the accordion?
[07:55:56] <johnkpaul> when I see the name "findActiveSlide" and "calculateSlidePos", I don't expect state to change
[07:56:11] <KatelyNix> johnkpaul: That's my intention.  Clearly, it fails to do so.
[07:56:28] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: just really don't want to make the wrong decission here, as it could seriously hinder us going forward
[07:56:52] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: you might want to do a bit more research beyond me here
[07:56:58] <johnkpaul> :)
[07:56:59] <ajpiano> i'm not 100% sure what the best practise is
[07:57:05] <KatelyNix> johnkpaul: The attempt simply comes from comments such as http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9314439/calling-jquery-functions-dynamically-in-a-html5-responsive-layout.
[07:57:07] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: recomended search terms?
[07:57:11] <jeffsmykil> UTC web apps?
[07:57:38] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2532729/daylight-saving-time-and-timezone-best-practices
[07:57:46] <ajpiano> i googled "best practise time zone"
[07:57:50] <jeffsmykil> tyvm ajpiano
[07:57:53] <johnkpaul> KatelyNix: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#method-resize
[07:59:29] <everytime> hey
[08:00:26] <KatelyNix> johnkpaul: No clue as yet what to do with that.  Or, specifically, what to wrap around what ...
[08:00:49] <johnkpaul> you want to resize the accordion when the window resizes
[08:00:55] <johnkpaul> you already have the code to do _something_ when the window resizes
[08:01:01] <johnkpaul> now you need the code to resize the accordion
[08:01:04] <johnkpaul> that's what that link is
[08:04:32] <KatelyNix> johnkpaul: Right.  Still no clue how specifcally to apply that to the accordion code I'm trying to use.  My jQuery skills are obvisously too new and vastly under-par.  Thanks anyway! I at least I have something relevant to read.
[08:05:51] <johnkpaul> no problem, KatelyNix, you can find a lot more learning materials here http://jqfundamentals.com/
[08:07:50] <KatelyNix> johnkpaul: Yep, found & been reading that already.  I've flailed around for a day+ on this already -- need to get a site into production.  For now, that'll mean removing the jQuery. Thanks again.
[08:08:57] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: "We will re-visit it next itteration"
[08:08:59] * jeffsmykil sighs
[08:09:04] <ajpiano> lol
[08:09:40] <coldhead> sad story, KatelyNix
[08:10:53] <KatelyNix> coldhead: sad?  hardly.  just practical.
[08:11:44] <NodeX> you can bind() to resize

[08:24:52] <skylamer`> bid
[08:24:58] <Keir> if i'm making a POST request with .ajax(), how can i add a key to the post variable so that i can pick it up on the php side?
[08:25:00] <skylamer`> first .empty() then set the text() or val() ? :)
[08:25:11] <skylamer`> Keir data
[08:25:24] <skylamer`> or make it manual with the url: :)
[08:25:31] <bid> thanks
[08:25:41] <Keir> i'm trying to do in php if( isset($_POST['theVar']) ) { do this } but my post just contains parameters without keys
[08:25:42] <bid> can i do it in one row?
[08:26:01] <Keir> sorry typed that before your super quick response, i'll look at .data() now

[08:29:14] <Chopps> hi guys, i need help, i display a gif while the page content is loading in the background, and when the content is fully loaded the gif is removed and the data is displayed, or at least is what i tried to do, but i get this: http://gyazo.com/ce0af57477bd4f3b6674fad4cf17f61e.png the data is displayed before the gif is hidden, can anyone pls tell me what i did wrong?? http://jvholik.info/test/
[08:29:14] <Chopps> < live demo
[08:29:55] <skylamer`> in the window load listener put .hide() after the all data is done :)
[08:30:10] <skylamer`> and then show() the data
[08:35:08] <Chopps> skylamer` this is my code http://pastebin.com/hDGeh3hC so i should just add a $(this).hide() right after $(window).load(function() { ?
[08:35:56] <ziz> Hey guys, using two jquery sliders on the home page of www.doctorackerman.com (plastic surgery site fyi), the both do not populate on IE8 but work elsewhere. According to some IE8 users, it does populate every once in a while.. Any ideas? The site is in WordPress which some of you might hate, but I thought maybe I could find a helpful person out there, thanks!
[08:37:12] <skylamer`> yea in the function
[08:38:53] <the> anyone worked on face recongnitian
[08:38:54] <the> ?
[08:41:32] <Chopps> skylamer` it didnt worked :(
[08:42:51] <skylamer`> can u show the code?
[08:44:31] <evelyette> hi
[08:44:45] <evelyette> I would like to remove certain element but delay the deletion for 10 seconds
[08:44:56] <evelyette> this is what I have now: $('#movediv').delay(10000).remove()
[08:44:59] <evelyette> but doesn't work
[08:45:10] <evelyette> I guess I can't use delay() and remove() together
[08:45:26] <evelyette> any ideas how can I achieve what I need?
[08:46:40] <johnkpaul> evelyette: delay is for use with the animation queue
[08:46:49] <johnkpaul> it doesn't delay anything else
[08:47:12] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn settimeout @ evelyette
[08:47:14] <bot-t> evelyette, window.setTimeout - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
[08:53:21] <poppiez> I have a problem with opera where I slide an image from outside of the window into the window by animating the left value. for about 200 ms the image isn't shown like opera doesn't show images that can't be seen
[08:58:31] <thomedy> so i have come up with a solution but i am worried about one thing
[08:58:57] <thomedy> i have all my content wrapped in a container div and i remove the container...and append the new div
[08:59:09] <thomedy> which now has the the container in it it...
[08:59:21] <thomedy> the end result is ajax only the page i want ever
[08:59:37] <thomedy> but no i have empty divs which could add up...
[08:59:53] <thomedy> how many lines of text/div's will be a problem
[09:00:20] <thomedy> nm i just thought of a solution for that too
[09:00:47] <shoky_> wat
[09:01:27] <thomedy> i just decrement my counter that is in the class name and remove class_name_ + count--
[09:01:29] <thomedy> and im good
[09:02:06] <Chopps> skylamer` sorry for the delay, i was afk, here is the code http://jvholik.info/test/js/tabs_test.js
[09:05:11] <skylamer`> no, Chopps, move .hide() to the function :)
[09:06:00] <fusion27> thanks johnkpaul
[09:07:37] <joo_p23> anybody know of a plugin to do facebook "Write a comment..." box?
[09:08:02] <joo_p23> you click inside the write a comment box and a textbox and your profile picture show up
[09:08:53] <Chopps> skylamer` updated code, can u check if thats what u meant pls?
[09:09:13] <skylamer`> yes maybe
[09:10:57] <Chopps> didnt worked
[09:16:10] <ccapndave> Hey there - I am trying to use $.ajax in IE8 and I keep getting 'SCRIPT5022: Exception thrown and not caught'
[09:24:57] <poppiez> I have a problem with opera where I slide an image from outside of the window into the window by animating the left value. for about 200 ms the image isn't shown like opera doesn't show images that can't be seen
[09:30:19] <coldhead> poppiez: Opera might not request images that aren't visible
[09:30:22] <coldhead> until they're visible
[09:31:01] <poppiez> coldhead: but that's insane, heh
[09:31:12] <poppiez> kind of impossible to create a slideshow
[09:31:15] <coldhead> its bandwidth friendly!
[09:31:28] <coldhead> you can probably preload the images with margin-left: -99999em;
[09:31:40] <coldhead> that probably counts as "visible"
[09:32:39] <poppiez> coldhead: hmm, no doesn't fix it. might be something else in my code then
[09:33:47] <coldhead> poppiez: you wanna check in your debugger that the images are being loaded?
[09:34:02] <coldhead> i assume opera has some kind of network request window
[09:34:23] <LSshock> hi all, im using Jquery UI and when i drag my object to sort it and drop it outside of the rows it animates to the top left corner of the browser, any way of making this better, like moving back to the old position. Or even better add it to the row you dropped it near
[09:36:22] <Cork> poppiez: have you tried reproduce it in a simple script?
[09:36:42] <Cork> ex. put the image outside the view with css and move it in with pure js
[09:36:49] <rroelofs> LSshock: We're probably going to need to see code to offer reasonable suggestions.  can you make a fiddle?
[09:37:14] <LSshock> think so, will do so now
[09:37:20] <rroelofs> LSshock: are you using sortable?
[09:37:28] <LSshock> yes
[09:38:37] <LSshock> any of the settings for revert sometimes gives me the same result (when it goes to the top left than appears back at original location)
[09:39:15] <poppiez> Cork: no, but I could try to do that
[09:39:40] <Cork> poppiez: btw does this happen with images in cache, or is it just when it needs to be fetched=
[09:39:40] <LSshock> i was just saying.. not sure whats causing it
[09:39:42] <Cork> *?
[09:41:28] <poppiez> Cork: if the image has been introduced in the viewport before, it doesn't happen but as soon as I refresh it happens again. I preload all images but it seems like opera gives "n/a" to the preloaded image and 200 OK to the images visible in the window
[09:42:02] <Cork> poppiez: ok, it sounds like opera does like firefox and render on draw
[09:42:18] <poppiez> Cork: okay but it works great in fox tho
[09:42:30] <poppiez> and chrome, safari and IE
[09:42:46] <poppiez> perhaps opera is slow to draw
[09:43:13] <sullitude> What's the difference between on() and bind() ?
[09:43:30] <keith_hyfn> sullitude: http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[09:43:46] <sullitude> keith_hyfn: thanks
[09:44:00] <keith_hyfn> sullitude: np, that always helps me
[09:44:29] <coldhead> good ol' elijah
[09:47:48] <amonat> Looking at the jQueryUI Datepicker source, _dialogDatepicker seems like it's never called. Is it supposed to be called directly by users, or am I missing something? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js#L305
[09:58:03] <niftylettuce> how can one simulate the drag and drop of a local file with a file created using File API or a Blob for instance?
[09:58:24] <niftylettuce> e.g. create file client side, and then drop it on a dropzone
[09:58:39] <niftylettuce> is this detailed in the spec somewhere?
[10:02:30] <mulinux> hi guys
[10:04:30] <mulinux> question: i use jquery.height to get the height from my element: <img src=â€‹"images/â€‹toystory.jpg" style=â€‹"position:â€‹absolute;â€‹ width:â€‹980px;â€‹ height:â€‹auto;â€‹ display:â€‹block !important;â€‹ top:â€‹-98px;â€‹ left:â€‹-123px;â€‹">â€‹
[10:04:58] <mulinux> but in safari i get always 0, instead in ie9, chrome and firefox i get the right integer 390
[10:05:16] <mulinux> someone know about this bug?
[10:06:07] <ndugu> i need help with the jquery cycle plugin
[10:08:32] <mulinux> anybody?
[10:08:36] <rroelofs> mulinux: my first guess would be a timing issue.  do you know if the image has loaded?
[10:09:09] <ndugu> it's really a forum question, so
[10:09:12] <ndugu> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/center-with-jquery-cycle-plugin
[10:09:48] <ndugu> :)
[10:10:03] <mulinux> rroelofs: i tried with document ready and with window.load, both delivers the same => zero
[10:12:37] <tw2113> ndugu http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/center-horz.html
[10:12:44] <ndugu> what's best? jquery cycle or css image gallery?
[10:12:46] <tw2113> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/div-center.html
[10:12:58] <tw2113> jquery cycle center image examples
[10:13:05] <greedo> is there a way to start adding to the DOM at a specific point?
[10:13:09] <tw2113> How do I center my slides inside the slideshow? Check out the center demos: center demo 1, center demo 2
[10:13:11] <ndugu> tw2113: i've read that, but i still can't figure it out
[10:13:24] <ndugu> i'm not a programmer :p
[10:13:51] <tw2113> well your empty css selectors would be part of it
[10:14:00] <tw2113> .slideshow { }
[10:14:01] <tw2113> .slideshow img { }
[10:14:16] <ndugu> so
[10:14:18] <rroelofs> mulinux: how about hooking into images load event
[10:15:06] <ndugu> should i put { margin: auto; display: block } in there or something?
[10:15:18] <tw2113> that'd be a good place to start
[10:15:20] <mulinux> rroelofs: its a slider
[10:15:38] <ndugu> what a riddle
[10:18:24] <ndugu> and?
[10:18:41] <ndugu> answering on the forum would be great
[10:20:51] <tw2113> but i'm not a forum member
[10:20:53] <tw2113> and you're here
[10:20:56] <ndugu> cool
[10:21:44] <ndugu> i can tell them how you solved it :p
[10:23:23] <tw2113> by pointing to the examples the author provided?
[10:23:27] <tw2113> :)
[10:23:30] <ndugu> yes
[10:23:31] <ndugu> :)
[10:24:15] <tw2113> whenever i use the plugin, which is a bit frequently, I tend to read through the site to see if there's any info about what i'm trying to solve
[10:24:23] <tw2113> it's pretty well documentined for what it's worth
[10:24:57] <ndugu> well
[10:25:18] <ndugu> i saw the examples and i've read the forums. maybe i lack the patience and concentration
[10:26:08] <ndugu> i've tried some options
[10:27:48] <ndugu> sigh.
[10:28:43] <tw2113> so you just need a bit more pointed direction
[10:28:46] <tw2113> it's all good
[10:30:21] <ndugu> yes
[10:30:48] <ndugu> i'll hang around if anyone wants to help

[10:43:43] <poppiez> Cork*

[10:48:05] <poppiez> Cork: and the larger the image, the longer it takes for the image to appear. don't know if I can do anything about it
[10:48:26] <Cork> nope
[10:48:52] <Cork> its the exact same thing firefox does, but firefox is a bit more lenient
[10:49:10] <Cork> poppiez: the user can disable the feature, but the web developer can't do anything
[10:49:57] <poppiez> Cork: if I trigger a reflow a second before the transition it might work

[11:10:40] <Raphael> Hello guys!
[11:10:54] <NoReGreT> cakehero: seems i'm in the wrong room xD
[11:11:36] <cakehero> lol oops
[11:11:50] <Raphael> I'm in need of an experienced jQuery plugin developer for refactoring of one of my custom plugins
[11:12:00] <Raphael> Time: Next two days
[11:13:13] <Raphael> It's a paid job â€¦ anybody interested !?
[11:17:12] <Keir__> if i have an object which contains some data, how can i add each value as a custom data attribute to a html node?
[11:17:59] <EyePulp> Keir__: a for loop?
[11:18:59] <EyePulp> Keir__: though I'd question the efficiency of that storage arrangement versus simply storing the entire object under a single .data() value and then doing .data('foo').some_key
[11:19:51] <johnkpaul> Keir__: why do you need it as a data attribute, or do you just want to store it in $.data?
[11:21:24] <Keir__> i think i need it as a data attribute, although to be fair im not very up to speed with $.data - i've got some sliders that generate some data on the fly then i'm storing them as data attributes on the submit button for later use, is this terrible?
[11:22:15] <dch> I have a bunch of script elements like so <script id="mustache-template" type="text/x-mustache-template"> <h1>{{name}}</h1></script> and want to know if I can select them something like $(':text/x-mustache-template') or some sort of $('script').filter('something'). Is there a better way?
[11:22:26] <johnkpaul> no, that's fine Keir__, if you're planning on submitting them with a form, I'd just update a hidden input though
[11:24:07] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery attribute selector @ dch
[11:24:08] <caniuse> dch: Attribute Equals Selector [name="value"] â€“ jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[11:24:16] <johnkpaul> ?attribute selector
[11:24:30] <Keir__> also on a slightly related note, why does doing this - var button = $('<button></button>'); result in [object][Object] when i append the var button to the page?
[11:25:40] <ndugu> ravenzz: no errors on my index page
[11:25:43] <ndugu> i'm a genius
[11:25:43] <dch> johnkpaul: thanks, giving that a go!
[11:26:11] <johnkpaul> Keir__: that should not be the case, demo?

[11:29:20] <ndugu> the only thing i have to fix now are the visible (real) errors
[11:32:39] <ndugu> dreamweaver is cheating
[11:32:44] <ndugu> i is for real
[11:32:57] <ravenzz> it is ok, I was looking at a cached version
[11:33:37] <Keir__> ahh sorry it was my fault (obviously :P) something to do with appending my variable that contained the button to another variable
[11:33:57] <easytiger> can anyone sport why the alert doesn't fire in this little post request?: http://dpaste.org/df2Ur/
[11:33:59] <ndugu> ok
[11:35:20] <easytiger> i'm getting the request through and a value returned ok
[11:36:08] <rroelofs> easytiger: have you tried console.log(data)?
[11:36:28] <rroelofs> where the alert is now?
[11:36:37] <easytiger> rroelofs: no.. one sec
[11:36:48] <b_52globe> hi guys anybody using jQuery.flXHRproxy
[11:36:48] <b_52globe> ?
[11:37:55] <Keir__> but sorry for my slowness, going back to my first question, what would be the best way to add my custom data attr to a button stored in a  var?
[11:38:12] <ndugu> yeah
[11:38:36] <ndugu> i'm also going back to my first question
[11:38:39] <easytiger> rroelofs: no it doesn't log. but outside the callback it does
[11:40:16] <rroelofs> easytiger: I'd bet that your callback isn't firing because there's something off about the status code or data being returned.  What do you see in the newtork panel?  status code? content-type?  data?
[11:42:28] <easytiger> rroelofs: you are a awesome! the http response was of type json
[11:42:31] <johnkpaul> ?data @ Keir__
[11:42:32] <caniuse> Keir__: .data(): Returns value at named data store for the first element in the jQuery collection, as set by data(name, value). http://api.jquery.com/data/
[11:42:46] <easytiger> rroelofs: but i didn't account for that in my jquery post
[11:43:19] <easytiger> removing that seems to have fixed the issue
[11:49:06] <Keir__> ahh thank you, my concept .data was way askew
[11:49:59] <ndugu> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/center-with-jquery-cycle-plugin
[11:50:01] <ndugu> help
[11:51:56] <Keir__> so would you recommend just storing it in .data rather than adding them as data attr, if i'm using the data to send in a form?
[11:52:29] <ziz> Hey guys, using two jquery sliders on the home page of www.doctorackerman.com (plastic surgery site fyi), the both do not populate on IE8 but work elsewhere. According to some IE8 users, it does populate every once in a while.. Any ideas? The site is in WordPress which some of you might hate, but I thought maybe I could find a helpful person out there, thanks!
[11:54:23] <Keir__> i've done both for posterity anyway, just wondering :P
[11:55:37] <dch> The exact match attribute equals  selector works, but fuzzy "contains" doesn't. Am I making any obvious screw-up?
[11:55:40] <dch> with  $('script[type="text/x-mustache-template"]') matches the expected 2 elements (tyvm) as does $('script[type^="text/x-mustache"]'), but $('script[type~="mustache"]') doesn't work as expected.
[11:57:04] <systemfault> dch: Why don't you read about what ~= does?
[12:00:37] <dch> systemfault: I have the manpage open in front of me, I have read it several times, reading it again: it's the "delimited by spaces" bit?
[12:00:41] <Keir__> i'm using an each loop to add the custom data attr but it in firebug it takes a really long time to update them, is this just firebug being slow or is the proces really inefficient do you think?
[12:01:55] <systemfault> dch: It means that $('script[type~="mustache"]') would only target <script type="mustache foo bar lol"> (one of the space separated words is mustache)
[12:01:58] <dch> aha I think I need * instead of ~ -- $('script[type*="mustache"]').
[12:02:04] <systemfault> dch: Right!
[12:02:20] <dch> it appears my 15 years of perl have lead to some incorrect assumptions :-)
[12:02:26] <systemfault> :D
[12:02:29] <dch> thanks systemfault
[12:03:15] <fission6> anyone here use backbone.js or an alterative would like a recommendation on these frameworks?
[12:04:38] <fission6> no one?
[12:07:06] <fusion27> johnkpaul: finally got it, thanks for your help http://caseywise.com/?p=2073
[12:07:16] <johnkpaul> no problem, fusion27
[12:07:31] <johnkpaul> fission6: I have used backbone, I am a fan, there are many alternatives

[12:21:09] <sjeijk> hi all i'm making dynamic divs  and in that  it has a button to add another 1, my problem is the first button works fine, but the 2nd button is not
[12:21:28] <sjeijk> whats a good way to add the functionality to the 2nd button?
[12:21:46] <sjeijk> i will rtfm but only need to know where
[12:23:40] <skylamer`> sjeijk, 'on'
[12:24:01] <sjeijk> thanks
[12:24:36] <ravenzz> is there a way to debug what's going on on an ipad from a laptop?
[12:25:48] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: yes it depends on what you want to debug exactly though
[12:26:21] <sjeijk> ravenzz also there is on the iPad itself a debug setting in safari
[12:26:27] <johnkpaul> ravenzz: http://www.iwebinspector.com/
[12:27:22] <johnkpaul> there's also the phonegap debugger wienre, ravenzz
[12:27:30] <ravenzz> yep but it is like that you don't have that power, like the webkit inspector
[12:28:34] <ravenzz> I also feel like an idiot when I use an ipad, because I don't my own one
[12:28:50] <johnkpaul> :) then buy a used one on ebay or something
[12:29:46] <ravenzz> no I mean, I should fix a bug which occurs only on ipads/iphones
[12:30:07] <ravenzz> but it is not easy to make changes on the fly, and test it
[12:34:57] <dapingwing> hey , how can i convert <td>10 / 10<br>5 / 5<br>5 / 5<br></td> to a jquery array with (10,10,5,5,5,5)
[12:36:29] <Lundy> str_replace("<td>", "(", string); str_replace("<br>" ",", string); .............
[12:36:45] <Lundy> oh in jquery :P
[12:36:52] <danzik17> dapingwing: probably something like $( "td" ).text().split( "/" ).map( function( num ) { return parseInt( num, 10 ); })
[12:38:08] <systemfault> .map doesn't work on older browsers without polyfill...
[12:38:11] <systemfault> AHhhh
[12:38:16] <systemfault> Nevermind :D
[12:38:23] <systemfault> I thought I was on ##Javascript
[12:38:51] <danzik17> systemfault: nah, you're right in this case.  it's a normal array, not a jquery object.  but he can solve that one, not like its hard to do =P
[12:38:54] <johnkpaul> systemfault: it's just as true here
[12:40:06] <dapingwing> doesn't work
[12:40:09] <dapingwing> it says 105 , 55
[12:41:12] <dapingwing> 10,105,55,5 -> should be 10,10,5,5,5,5
[12:42:29] <johnkpaul> dapingwing: take danzik17's code and change it to do what you need
[12:42:38] <johnkpaul> he made the assumption that everything was separated by a /, but that's not the case
[12:45:04] <dapingwing> got it ;)
[12:45:12] <dapingwing> replaced all <br> with /
[12:46:06] <davidangel> Holla at some players.
[12:46:30] <davidangel> I need help with this chunk of code that controls my Content Tabs in a wordpress theme
[12:46:30] <davidangel> http://pastebin.com/FUr3RNcG
[12:46:57] <davidangel> Right now you can't link to a url with the #target and have it open the appropriate tab.
[12:47:14] <davidangel> I'd love for that functionality to exist, but I'm pretty bad with jQuery.
[12:47:28] <davidangel> Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[12:55:41] <wavez> I can't figure out how to make this function iterate through my selection and make a progress bar on each one separately.
[12:55:42] <wavez> http://pastebin.com/v4TxBhrf
[12:55:58] <wavez> Instead, all progress bars come out with the same value.
[12:56:19] <wavez> I tried using .each() but I couldn't make it work
[12:58:55] <shoky_> should work fine with .each
[12:59:49] <shoky_> $("tr .c4").each(function() { $(this).progressbar({ value: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100, 100) }) } )
[13:01:44] <wavez> shoky_, you're right, that does work. When I try to clear the text though, that doesn't work.
[13:02:14] <wavez> oh wait, there it goes
[13:02:21] <shoky_> ;p
[13:02:23] <wavez> thanks shoky_, I don't know what I was doing wrong
[13:02:37] <shoky_> that's where debugging is helpful
[13:02:52] <shoky_> console logs and/or step-debugging
[13:10:05] <wavez> shoky_, I think what I had wrong was the lack of $(function(){
[13:10:13] <wavez> because I don't understand js actually
[13:11:37] <batterhead> anyone ever use nested $.each() like this http://jsfiddle.net/ibike365/5DD9d/
[13:12:21] <batterhead> i'm wondering if there is some convention for the variables in the second function() since I can't use k, v again
[13:14:06] <johnkpaul> batterhead: the second v shadows the first v, what probem are you having
[13:14:38] <batterhead> i need a new variable in the second $.each not the shadow
[13:14:52] <batterhead> just wondering how folks usually name that second set of variables
[13:15:19] <johnkpaul> batterhead: I'd try to name them something close to what they actually represent
[13:15:37] <batterhead> good idea
[13:16:36] <imsky> i'm here, let's do this
[13:18:40] <sirtophat> does the .ajax load encode the data in any way or does it get it exactly as it exists
[13:19:56] <johnkpaul> sirtophat: what do you mean "encode the data"?
[13:20:06] <durre> I'm looking for a rating plugin for jquery. something that can take a div and render the right number of stars & half-stars depending on the rating I put on something like data-rating="3.5"
[13:20:26] <johnkpaul> jquery will convert to json for example if the content type header is sent as application/json or the dataType is set to json
[13:20:41] <sirtophat> I have a bin file on my server containing 0x00 0xaa 0xbb and I'm not sure at what step of retrieving it and parsing it it's turning into all 0x65533
[13:20:49] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery plugin rating stars data attributes @ durre
[13:21:06] <caniuse> durre: jQuery Raty - A Star Rating Plugin - http://www.wbotelhos.com/raty/
[13:21:28] <johnkpaul> sirtophat: check in the network panel of your debugger
[13:22:40] <sirtophat> it's showing it as three question marks in black diamonds, which is what I think 0x66533 is
[13:22:45] <durre> looks just about right, thx!
[13:24:37] <johnkpaul> sirtophat: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2523355/jquery-ajax-can-my-server-return-a-blob-of-data
[13:27:14] <LondonGuy> Is there some documentation of some sort that explains ajax function arguments e.g. event, data, status, xhr... I've noticed that for e.g. if I log "data" to console when it is the second argument of the function what I see in console is different from what I see if I pass it as a first argument if that makes sense. I'd just like to understand these arguments once and for all. Thanks
[13:28:51] <johnkpaul> ?ajax @ LondonGuy
[13:29:37] <LondonGuy> ajax request
[13:29:55] <LondonGuy> for a form
[13:29:57] <xec> LondonGuy: you're talking about the success callback?
[13:30:13] <LondonGuy> Yea
[13:31:32] <xec> ok, i agree the documentation is lacking a bit in that department too. anyway it gets 3 parameters passed, data, textStatus, jqXHR
[13:31:33] <johnkpaul> LondonGuy: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:31:35] <xec> in that order
[13:31:38] <cwr> hi
[13:31:38] <johnkpaul> success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)
[13:32:32] <sirtophat> the new web technology is great but it forgets the most basic things sometimes
[13:33:09] <sirtophat> like that transferring raw data shouldn't need a bunch of hoops to be jumped through
[13:33:19] <LondonGuy> So is that basically the same as these: event, data, status, xhr ignoring the event.
[13:33:34] <LondonGuy> Some code I was looking over had "event" as one of the arguments
[13:33:50] <cwr> I am a completely noob :) Currently I try something like that. I have a link <a href="#" onclick=foo()>. so the function foo() is a standard javascript function. Can I run jQuery Code from inside this function? I tried something like $('p'.hide()); but saw no effect. Am I doing something completely wrong??
[13:34:14] <LondonGuy> when I removed event I noticed that console.log was no longer showing HTMl. instead it was showing f.event
[13:34:37] <skylamer`> check what uyoure writing again, cwr
[13:34:37] <skylamer`> :)
[13:36:09] <shoelessone> strange, anybody know why $('#buildtree > div') would only match the first div?
[13:36:31] <xec> shoelessone: you know what the ">" does?
[13:36:32] <shoelessone> if there are multiple divs that should match it?
[13:36:33] <shoelessone> yes
[13:36:36] <shoelessone> imediate children
[13:36:44] <shoelessone> so the first level divs under neath
[13:36:52] <shoelessone> i'll throw it up in jsfiddle really quick
[13:36:55] <xec> right
[13:37:07] <draginx> Why does var initials = prompt("Enter initials"); always return false?
[13:37:32] <sirtophat> as usual I have to reinvent the fundamental aspects of programming when working with javascript and encode these chip-8 roms in base64
[13:37:54] <cwr> skylamer`: damn :D It is really getting late here. Working now. jQuery is cool stuff...
[13:38:02] <imsky> tell me about it
[13:38:20] <tuubow_> Hi guys i have a question related history.js on github. How to maintain the state of the page on browser refresh button click Any idea.
[13:39:03] <shoelessone> http://jsfiddle.net/6yj2E/
[13:39:10] <xec> draginx: it doesn't?
[13:39:17] <draginx> xec: wrong it does
[13:39:21] <draginx> array(2) { ["certificate_add_value"]=> string(1) "4" ["initials"]=> string(5) "false" }
[13:39:22] <shoelessone> i would hope that three divs would have borders
[13:39:25] <draginx> var dumping $_POST
[13:39:44] <xec> draginx: wha, this is PHP?
[13:39:49] <draginx> its a mixture
[13:39:51] <draginx> of php and js
[13:39:55] <draginx> im cocnerned about the js part
[13:40:01] <draginx> cause alert(initials); does the same
[13:40:02] <draginx> says "false"
[13:40:09] <xec> but you post the server side result?
[13:40:26] <draginx> yes because the consoel.log just says "false"
[13:40:30] <draginx> it says the *same* exact thing
[13:40:37] <xec> doesnt here
[13:40:42] <xec> make a demo?
[13:40:47] <shoelessone> jquery's own example uses <li> elements, which I suppose is more common, but it should work I'd think the same with divs
[13:40:48] <shoelessone> http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[13:40:55] <shoelessone> again, here is my example: http://jsfiddle.net/6yj2E/
[13:41:05] <skylamer`> ur matching tags , shoelessone
[13:41:23] <shoelessone> not sure what you mean :(
[13:41:27] <shoelessone> which makes me feel like a total newb
[13:41:29] <shoelessone> but, there it is
[13:41:47] <shoelessone> I want the imediate children of div#buildtree
[13:41:59] <shoelessone> that's what I though #buildtree > div would give me
[13:42:03] <draginx> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/yydWM/
[13:42:09] <imsky> shoelessone, that would work
[13:42:17] <skylamer`> http://jsfiddle.net/6yj2E/2/
[13:42:26] <skylamer`> look closesly in ur html :)
[13:42:35] <imsky> hey skylamer` what's good pardna
[13:42:49] <draginx> xec: the function wont return :/
[13:43:07] <skylamer`> hi, imsky :D)
[13:43:08] <shoelessone> HA!
[13:43:11] <shoelessone> <3 skylamer`
[13:43:25] <draginx> nvm got it
[13:43:31] <xec> draginx: youre setting it to '' in your if
[13:43:44] <xec> draginx: do comparisons with === not =
[13:43:59] <draginx> ah ty
[13:46:20] <xec> draginx: also, your check_initials function looks like it does exactly the same as prompt already does
[13:47:11] <xec> just a longer name :D
[13:49:03] <wavez> How do I change this code, using .each(), to interate over all my tables?
[13:49:03] <wavez> http://pastebin.com/XhATGays
[13:57:00] <FunnyLookinHat> wavez, err...  $('table').each()  ?  Not sure what you're asking.  :)
[13:58:15] <wavez> FunnyLookinHat, I'm using :gt(1) to skip the first row, but it only works for my first table.
[13:58:18] <FunnyLookinHat> Or maybe you mean $('table tr:gt(1) .c4').each()
[13:58:30] <FunnyLookinHat> Oh that's because you're selecting from all tables, use what I just sent, that should work
[13:58:44] <wavez> I tried that :/
[13:58:56] <FunnyLookinHat> or - $('table').each(function() { $(this).find('tr:gt(1) .c4').whatever });
[13:59:12] <FunnyLookinHat> i.e. loop all tables, and then search within the table
[14:01:24] <DennisCalazansCo> Can any1 tell me about the geolocalization support by jQuery?
[14:01:56] <wavez> FunnyLookinHat, ya, I tried both of those :/
[14:01:57] <wavez> http://pastebin.com/aWphL44n
[14:02:16] <wavez> using $("table").each(function(){
[14:02:22] <wavez> makes the progressbars not show up at all
[14:02:40] <FunnyLookinHat> wavez, hah ok then just do something ghetto with a flag...  like this ( snippet incoming )
[14:03:30] <FunnyLookinHat> wavez, http://pastebin.com/191kskkB
[14:03:38] <FunnyLookinHat> super ghetto but should work if your dom is done correctly
[14:03:57] <FunnyLookinHat> I've never used gt because it never seems to work how I want it to
[14:04:27] <wavez> FunnyLookinHat, ah, fair enough. I'll use this. Thanks :)
[14:07:51] <nFFF> you can just use slice
[14:08:27] <nFFF> $('table tr').slice(1).find('.c4').each(functin(){ });
[14:10:55] <nFFF> $('table tr').slice(1).find('.c4').text('').progressbar({ value: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100, 100) }) // is there any reaosn why you cant chain it?
[14:12:07] <wavez> nFFF, chain it? I'm new to js
[14:12:25] <wavez> oh, I see
[14:13:04] <nFFF> wavez, most jquery functions return a jquery set of objects
[14:13:13] <nFFF> thus you can chain methods onto each other
[14:15:51] <nFFF> also if your tr's are always in <table> then youll find perofrmance beneifts from just doing $('tr')
[14:17:17] <rhizmoe> how common is it to refer to .currentTarget? that seems to smell to me, but i'm a bit n00bl4r
[14:18:01] <imsky> what the hell is currenttarget
[14:18:14] <nFFF> an event property
[14:18:24] <wavez> nFFF, I tried those options you suggested. It seems that .each() has to receive the handle to a function for it to work
[14:18:24] <rhizmoe> nm, it's `this`
[14:18:46] <imsky> lol
[14:20:44] <aidan> Is it safe to include javascript and omit the protocol, like <script type="text/javascript" src="//www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion.js"></script>
[14:20:51] <aidan> seems like a safe way to get HTTP/HTTPS
[14:21:12] <rhizmoe> how can i refer to a div of dynamic id? $.each(foo, function(key,bar){ this.find('...') } // '...' is a div of id:key
[14:22:14] <Anoia> hi ll
[14:22:15] <Anoia> +
[14:22:32] <nFFF> dynamic id?
[14:22:47] <Anoia> what's the best way to get the size of the content of an HTML page?
[14:22:57] <Azra-el> how can i make a div that moves in 10px increments to the left.. say i have a div.. and a button .. button is clicked once .. div translate3d(10px,0,o)... button is clicked twice .. div translate3d(20px,0,0) etc... any way to do it in css alone or javascript is needeed?
[14:22:58] <rhizmoe> nFFF: yeah, i'm looping json of whose keys are ids i need to modify
[14:23:04] <aidan> rhizmoe: $(this).find('#' + yourdiv)
[14:23:09] <rhizmoe> + got it, thanks :)
[14:23:25] <rhizmoe> and ('div#'+foo) is ok?
[14:23:37] <aidan> yes, but div# is kinda ugly
[14:23:49] <aidan> it's redundant
[14:23:57] <aidan> but that's a matter of style, so whatever you're into :)
[14:23:58] <jaredhoyt> rhizmoe: Why does event.currentTarget "seem to smell"?
[14:24:02] <rhizmoe> ah, because ID :)
[14:24:05] <ndugu> i still haven't found an answer
[14:24:09] <ndugu> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/center-with-jquery-cycle-plugin
[14:24:11] <ndugu> to this
[14:24:17] <rhizmoe> jaredhoyt: because as i've found out, it's typically a synonym for `this`
[14:24:28] <ndugu> i want my pictures to be centered without sliding, just fading when you click
[14:24:35] <jaredhoyt> rhizmoe: No, .target and .currentTarget are different.
[14:25:13] <nFFF> jaredhoyt, but currentTarget will always === this surely?
[14:25:33] <jaredhoyt> rhizmoe: It has to do with bubbling. If you had `<p><span>something</span></p>` with a click handler on the `<p>`, and clicked on the span, .target would refer to the span while .currentTarget would refer to the p.
[14:26:06] <nFFF> jaredhoyt, he's talking about currenttarget and 'this' not about target
[14:26:52] <jaredhoyt> In a normal click handler, then yeah I'd imagine this === currentTarget… not actually sure if you're using delegation.
[14:27:20] <nFFF> it doesn't matter
[14:28:48] <jaredhoyt> Ah, apparently IE7/8 have no event.currentTarget and this does not refer to the source element, but the window object instead. jQuery probably corrects this behavior.
[14:29:14] <jaredhoyt> But in basic JavaScript, you would refer to event.srcElement instead in those browsers.
[14:30:23] <sirtophat> turns out the answer was to just not use jquery
[14:30:31] <sirtophat> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/Sending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data
[14:32:32] <imsky> maybe, make sure it works across legacy browsers
[14:33:58] <Ricaz> I have something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/DKbnn/ - but I want to add content in the box. In other words, I want to cycle only the background, not the content. Any clues?
[14:34:06] <sirtophat> I don't want to support legacy browsers
[14:34:09] <Ricaz> I'm not going to use any position:absolute; stuff.
[14:34:39] <sirtophat> supporting old browsers perpetuates malware
[14:35:04] <ndugu> does anyone know how to use the jquery cycle plugin to center images? i want my pictures to fade when you click, in full size
[14:35:24] <ndugu> uh, i have to go
[14:35:25] <ndugu> nevermind
[14:35:45] <imsky> sirtophat, ok, ie9 and firefox 3.6 perpetuates malware
[14:36:04] <Azra-el> guys... if i got a div.. and a button .. how can i animate (with translate3d) that said div a specific increment on each button click?
[14:36:05] <sirtophat> I meant browsers that aren't getting updated
[14:36:57] <Ricaz> Anyone? :)
[14:41:14] <Ricaz> :(
[14:42:56] <Azra-el> anybody can throw me a bone? :P
[14:43:57] <sirtophat> http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/2/2a/104Cubone.png
[14:44:32] <imsky> here i am
[14:44:35] <imsky> who needs help
[14:45:03] <DennisCalazansCo> hi
[14:45:03] <DennisCalazansCo> i need somehelp
[14:45:13] <imsky> just in time too
[14:45:25] <nFFF> Azra-el, Im guessing put your content in the background elements?
[14:45:29] <DennisCalazansCo> do you know something about the Jquery's support to HTML5?
[14:45:48] <imsky> nah never heard of it
[14:46:07] <Ricaz> I have something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/DKbnn/ - but I want to add content in the box. In other words, I want to cycle only the background, not the content. Any clues?
[14:46:15] <Ricaz> I'm not going to use any position:absolute; stuff.
[14:46:27] <nFFF> ricaz, Im guessing put your content in the background elements?
[14:46:48] <Ricaz> No, the content shouldn't be scrolling with it
[14:46:52] <imsky> why not position absolute, ricaz
[14:46:54] <imsky> you're already using it
[14:47:11] <Ricaz> Because I like flow.
[14:47:18] <DennisCalazansCo> imsky, dude, im a front end engineer professional, within freednod net wich are the best channels like javascript css?
[14:47:30] <imsky> DennisCalazansCo, yeah those are good
[14:47:41] <imsky> Ricaz, flow inside your container?
[14:48:00] <Ricaz> The container obviously isn't going to be the only thing on the site.
[14:48:52] <Ricaz> I like the idea of having the content inside the div#container, and then only scrolling the background-image.
[14:48:59] <DennisCalazansCo> imsky: Thank you very much, pal
[14:49:15] <imsky> Ricaz, maybe scroll the background-image then?
[14:49:16] <alexwait> Heya jQuery fans! :D I have a simple jqueryElement.find("text, button, textarea, input") selector I Am running. It returns an object whose lengths' property is "NaN"
[14:49:18] <alexwait> how is this possible?
[14:49:19] <alexwait> :P
[14:49:30] <nFFF> Ricaz http://jsfiddle.net/DKbnn/1/
[14:49:46] <nFFF> :D
[14:49:49] <imsky> countdown to "psh i said no absolutes"
[14:49:49] <imsky> 3
[14:49:50] <imsky> 2
[14:49:50] <alexwait> I have a debugger set on this line for when this happens, and if I run the same statement again in Chrome's watch window, it returns 7 elements, just as I'd expect
[14:49:50] <Ricaz> See, position: absolute;
[14:49:51] <imsky> 1
[14:49:54] <Ricaz> :>
[14:50:35] <Ricaz> imsky yes, why not=
[14:50:38] <DennisCalazansCo> imsky: Are you going to jquery conference in san francisco ?
[14:50:41] <Ricaz> that was my question in the first place
[14:50:56] <imsky> DennisCalazansCo, don't think so buddy
[14:51:14] <StevenCodes> sup everyone
[14:51:25] <nFFF> but what else can you possibly do Ricaz?
[14:51:42] <nFFF> the plugin your using obviously cycles all child elements of container
[14:51:42] <Ricaz> .. I want to know HOW to scroll the background-image in css :P
[14:51:43] <DennisCalazansCo> imsky: since im from brazil, what do you think about going to the conference? it's an international trip
[14:52:00] <Ricaz> .cycle() was just an example
[14:52:04] <nFFF> whats wrong with doing position absolute?
[14:52:25] <DennisCalazansCo> imsky: is it woth the price?
[14:52:26] <Ricaz> I like flow.
[14:52:31] <nFFF> what does that even mean?
[14:52:32] <poppiez> I have a div with position: absolute; top: 49px; bottom: 0; how do I get the height of it? height() doesn't seem to work
[14:52:37] <StevenCodes> let alone that why do that it would look stupid it's just scrolling under something that never moves
[14:52:42] <Ricaz> That I have the content as a child of the container
[14:52:52] <nFFF> wrap them both in a paren container
[14:52:57] <nFFF> simples
[14:53:03] <imsky> Ricaz, http://jsfiddle.net/DKbnn/2/
[14:53:31] <nFFF> ^^
[14:53:31] <DennisCalazansCo> imsky: last year a guy from jquery ui came to brazil
[14:53:52] <imsky> DennisCalazansCo, if you can afford it and want to see america, why not
[14:54:01] <imsky> san francisco isn't exactly posh
[14:54:06] <imsky> so up to you
[14:54:37] <Ricaz> <_>
[14:55:04] <nFFF> Ricaz what do you even mean by flow?
[14:55:06] <DennisCalazansCo> imsky: really? i always thought san francisco would be a nice city to visit. But, ok, man, thank you very much for you attention.
[14:55:08] <nFFF> Im intrigued :<
[14:55:12] <Ricaz> I might as well build my whole site with position:absolute; then
[14:55:25] <DennisCalazansCo> imsky: have a good night
[14:55:27] <nFFF> why?
[14:55:32] <imsky> DennisCalazansCo, it's fine to visit, ironically they have nice brazilian steakhouses. have a good one man, later
[14:55:40] <StevenCodes> Ricaz,  Don't
[14:55:49] <imsky> position absolute ALL the things
[14:55:57] <imsky> shit, pinterest does it
[14:56:03] <Ricaz> yes, that will be easier to manage
[14:56:05] <imsky> you think you're better than pinterest?
[14:56:09] <systemfault> imsky: absolute is for noobs, real men use "fixed"
[14:56:17] <imsky> systemfault, real men also use visibility:hidden
[14:56:21] <imsky> it's there noob! open firebug!
[14:56:24] <StevenCodes> haha
[14:57:07] <imsky> we need to bring art and pretension back into the web dev world
[14:57:17] <imsky> have a monstrous 1MB site where every element is hidden
[14:57:22] <imsky> but if you mouse over it it shows up
[14:57:27] <sirtophat> I love things like that
[14:57:42] <systemfault> imsky: I also miss flash websites that have loading bars...
[14:57:51] <imsky> circular loaders these days systemfault
[14:57:56] * imsky is an old school flash bro
[14:57:58] <systemfault> 0.23/25MB
[14:58:05] <imsky> -1/9MB
[14:58:12] <nFFF> those days where crazy in hindsight
[14:58:22] <imsky> don't make me reminisce you bastards
[14:58:27] <imsky> i'll tell you about "those days"
[14:58:38] <nFFF> 10 minute delays just to load an intro before you can even enter the main site
[14:58:39] <systemfault> At leastâ€¦ with flash, your website looked the same on every browser :P
[14:58:44] <imsky> ^^
[14:58:48] <imsky> by far the best feature
[14:58:52] <StevenCodes> http://stevencodes.herobo.com/?CanvasEnabled=1 ya like that ?
[14:59:06] <imsky> well i see you stole paul irish's idea
[14:59:10] <alexwait> I have a simple jqueryElement.find("text, button, textarea, input") selector I Am running. It returns an object whose lengths' property is "NaN"

[14:59:26] <elguapo99> could someone look at this question please
[14:59:27] <imsky> alexwait, man i don't know who cares
[14:59:29] <StevenCodes> imsky,  Same idea coded different
[14:59:35] <StevenCodes> :)
[14:59:35] <imsky> StevenCodes, do better
[14:59:49] <alexwait> ?
[14:59:51] <StevenCodes> http://stevencodes.herobo.com/?CanvasEnabled=2
[14:59:53] <alexwait> why so rude imsky?
[14:59:54] <StevenCodes> That one nice ?
[15:00:02] <imsky> StevenCodes, that's way better
[15:00:04] <StevenCodes> no that one sucks actually
[15:00:07] <nFFF> StevenCodes you work for free?
[15:00:08] <imsky> alexwait, your question makes no sense
[15:00:16] <StevenCodes> nFFF,  Don't work it's a hobby
[15:00:18] <sirtophat> elements with undefined lengths are the best
[15:00:23] <imsky> yeah
[15:00:23] <alexwait> yes it does :P
[15:00:30] <imsky> ?js 0
[15:00:30] <alexwait> A jQuery selector
[15:00:35] <imsky> bot-t you sonofabitch
[15:00:37] <alexwait> is returning a jQuery onject with a length of "NaN"
[15:00:39] <nFFF> StevenCodes im confused :D
[15:00:40] <systemfault> sirtophat: Only with a bit of salt
[15:00:45] <sirtophat> $("#whatareyoudoing").css("width",tan(90))
[15:00:54] <imsky> ooh tan
[15:00:57] <imsky> Math.tan maybe
[15:01:00] <StevenCodes> nFFF,  Meaning i'm not getting payed for this, so ask away :)
[15:01:01] <sirtophat> yeah
[15:01:26] <nFFF> StevenCodes are you a student or somehting?
[15:01:46] <nFFF> oh sorry, it says low cost fee
[15:01:51] <nFFF> misread that as free
[15:02:11] <StevenCodes> nFFF,  Just made that for fun as a portfolio
[15:02:20] <nFFF> are you indian?
[15:02:24] <StevenCodes> Nah lol
[15:02:27] <StevenCodes> White
[15:02:45] <StevenCodes> are you indian ?
[15:02:45] <nFFF> where abouts you from, you charge $15/hr
[15:02:48] <nFFF> surely 3rd world?
[15:03:00] <StevenCodes> nFFF,  I don't charge at all lol
[15:03:08] <StevenCodes> the site was for fun :)
[15:03:15] <StevenCodes> if I see a project I like I jump on that shit
[15:03:18] <sirtophat> I'd do random web jobs for $15/hr
[15:03:20] <systemfault> I don't even start my editor for under 50$/hour
[15:03:24] <sirtophat> I'm still in school too though
[15:03:35] <StevenCodes> i just graduated :)
[15:05:04] <alexwait> what kind of object could it be where it has a find() function?
[15:05:11] <alexwait> a basic array does not
[15:05:21] <nFFF> jquery objet
[15:05:31] <nFFF> ?find at alexwait
[15:05:31] <caniuse> nFFF: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[15:05:36] <alexwait> nFFF: but the length is NaN
[15:06:54] <nFFF> ok whats the exact code
[15:06:56] <nFFF> sounds wierd
[15:07:05] <nFFF> ?jsfiddle @ alexwait
[15:07:39] <alexwait> I can't give you a jsfiddle that reproduces
[15:07:56] <nFFF> why?
[15:08:03] <alexwait> it's a timing issue :P
[15:08:24] <imsky> alexwait, ok, screenshare then, https://join.me
[15:08:24] <alexwait> I just want to know the general ideas behind why length could EVER be NaN
[15:08:35] <imsky> not gonna debug .length=NaN over irc
[15:08:57] <alexwait> is there any general info out there
[15:09:00] <nFFF> if you were subtracting
[15:09:02] <alexwait> why it could be NAN>?
[15:09:04] <nFFF> or doing any math
[15:09:07] <nFFF> with udnefined
[15:09:08] <imsky> yes, programmer error
[15:09:16] <alexwait> It'd take me a week
[15:09:26] <alexwait> to replicate a system as complicated as the one I am working on to get it on jsfiddle
[15:09:31] <alexwait> I know it's a large tough question
[15:09:44] <alexwait> but I'd like any info on why it could be NaN and then I'd try to intepret if we're doing anything like this
[15:10:41] <nFFF> alexwait if whaetver you are doing .length on doesn' exis
[15:10:45] <nFFF> i.e. undefined
[15:10:49] <nFFF> and you try to do math with it
[15:10:54] <nFFF> you will most likely get NaN
[15:10:54] <alexwait> no math involved
[15:11:00] <alexwait> it' a simple getContainerObject().find()
[15:11:07] <alexwait> containerObject has a length of 1
[15:11:23] <alexwait> I've put in a deugger for when length isn't defined
[15:11:33] <alexwait> if I run the same code in Chrome's watch
[15:11:35] <alexwait> it works fine
[15:11:44] <alexwait> what kind of state could the DOM be in
[15:11:52] <nFFF> who knows
[15:12:00] <nFFF> are we suppose to fire random guesses?
[15:12:02] <nFFF> :<
[15:12:48] <alexwait> yeah I know. it's a bad question I'ms orry :(
[15:12:52] <alexwait> Just so frustrating
[15:12:57] <alexwait> I don't know enough about jQuery
[15:13:00] <alexwait> why is it reacting in this way
[15:13:22] <nFFF> nan stands for not a number if that helps you :>
[15:14:07] <alexwait> ;)
[15:14:23] <nFFF> it would usually happen when you try doing an arithmetic on a non number :>
[15:14:36] <nFFF> so apart from that i cant help
[15:14:47] <alexwait> more than nothing :D
[15:14:48] <alexwait> thanks!
[15:15:06] <imsky> do a typeof of the .find()
[15:15:19] <alexwait> excellent idea! :D
[15:15:54] <alexwait> tysm
[15:16:01] <imsky> what
[15:16:14] <alexwait> thank you so much
[15:16:20] <imsky> for what
[15:16:36] <alexwait> the typeof suggestion
[15:16:40] <alexwait> :D
[15:16:53] <imsky> ok brah have fun in your sarcastic universe
[15:17:05] <alexwait> I wasn't being sarcastic :P
[15:17:08] <alexwait> It is a good idea :D
[15:17:24] <imsky> why
[15:17:28] <coldhead> your sarcasm detection is really good, imsky
[15:17:45] <imsky> coldhead, well it comes from years of- oh i see

[15:24:21] <Mylesmadness> Is anyone here familiar with roundabout(http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout)? I'm having a an issue where the stuff in the boxes doesnt scale with the boxes, and breaks layout. http://mylesmadness.com/New%20Site/
[15:34:42] <MyMorningCoffee> Is it possible to .dblclick from mobile / iOS?
[15:59:49] <lyrae> guys... i have a problem I don't know how to debug =|
[16:00:25] <lyrae> it works on my localhost...but not on the remote server that hosts it. it works in firefox everywhere, but not chrome
[16:04:18] <brl0> is there a method that causes jquery autocomplete to rescan the local data array passed during instantiation?
[16:06:12] <brl0> the goal is new terms created on the fly are then included as candidate matches during a search
[16:06:47] <Mylesmadness> Is anyone here familiar with roundabout(http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout)? I'm having a an issue where the stuff in the boxes doesnt scale with the boxes, and breaks layout. http://mylesmadness.com/New%20Site/
[16:08:52] <brl0> Mylesmadness: looks like you can do a couple of things.. overflow: hidden on #slides, or try and prevent the 'Visit My Github' from wrapping
[16:10:15] <brl0> that is if you're refering to the octocat image appearing outside of the green box
[16:10:27] <brl0> referring even..
[16:11:24] <Mylesmadness> br10: overflow:hidden doesnt play nice on the slides really. and im refering to the everything flowing out the box, I would have assumed the plugin would scale the things in the box.
[16:16:20] <brl0> Mylesmadness: looks like they plugin only resizes the container, and attempts to scale fonts by updating the font sizes.
[16:16:46] <brl0> it doesn't look like it will scale the contents of the 'slide', unless of course they're already relative to the size of the slide
[16:17:54] <Mylesmadness> br10: So I should attempt to use percents?
[16:18:50] <brl0> I tried with a percentage and it appeared to work..
[16:18:58] <brl0> but I only tried it in one browser :D
[16:20:21] <Dr-Bombay> where do I look in the jquery documentation to find out how to run two animations concurrently on the same element
[16:24:34] <antnash> Alright guys. I'm trying to turn an event handler off for an element using $(this).parent('tr').off('click'); which I believe should work, but not having any luck. Could someone have a look at this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/JzHYH/12/ and give me a hint as to where I'm going wrong please
[16:27:24] <ShaunR> i want to use run addClass() to each previous element so i'm tyring to do ('ul li').mouseover(function() { $(this).prev().each().addClass('selected'); }); but that doesnt work, if i remove the each() it works but only adds the class to the previous element.  I want to add it to all the previous elements within that parent
[16:27:27] <Dr-Bombay> what's the effect of the line supposed to be?
[16:29:44] <antnash> Dr-Bombay: It's supposed to turn off the click handler for the parent table row so that when you click within the text boxes it doesn't toggle the check state of the row
[16:30:07] <antnash> There's probably a better way of doing what I want, I just don't know it
[16:31:12] <ShaunR> n/m found prevAll()
[16:32:25] <Dr-Bombay> antnash: "The selector string must exactly match the one passed to .on() when the event handler was attached."
[16:32:56] <antnash> oh, right.
[16:35:39] <antnash> Dr-Bombay: Is there some way I can only register the click within the text input and not the row?
[16:41:39] <brl0> in case anyone was wondering about my question above, you can use the 'custom' source callback that iterates over the local data source each time, tests matches against $.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex, and pow

[16:47:59] <vant> Hi there, I have a conceptual question: I have a form that a user can enter an ISBN into. Once the user has entered 10/13 characters I get information on the book from the Google Books API using .getJSON(). I have bound this to a 'keyup' event. The problem I have is that if the user alt-tabs away and back into the window with the form it re-does the .getJSON().
[16:49:40] <vant> What I was thinking on how to fix that, was to compare the input between the two inputs between two keyup events and compare them; If they are the same, then it will not redo the .getJSON(). I am unsure on how to go about doing that though
[16:49:51] <vant> Maybe there is a better way to do it altogether
[16:50:00] <tystr> Anyony going to mongoNYC?

[17:20:58] <cornellhub> Hello!
[17:21:35] <cornellhub> I'm wondering about a certain functionality of the jQuery .animate() method
[17:21:42] <cornellhub> am I in the right place?
[17:22:25] <cornellhub> my website is here
[17:22:26] <cornellhub> http://cornellhub.com/board/
[17:23:00] <cornellhub> and i'm trying to write a function with animate that will scroll down to the next thread on the main board, pause for maybe 1.5 seconds, then scroll down to the next, then pause for 1.5 seconds, until it's at the bottom of the page and then break
[17:23:28] <cornellhub> there are 18 threads per page so it would obviously be a loop that runs 17 times
[17:23:38] <cornellhub> but how do i write the staggered scrolling animation?
[17:23:47] <cornellhub> i am also trying to use scrollTop()
[17:23:57] <cornellhub> which i have used successfully before, albeit for a simpler funciton
[17:24:01] <antnash> looked at setTimeout?
[17:24:35] <cornellhub> looking up setTimeout
[17:25:05] <cornellhub> like i guess i would want a chained animation too?
[17:27:25] <cornellhub> hold on, i'll show you what code I have
[17:28:48] <cornellhub> I have this so far
[17:28:48] <cornellhub> http://pastebin.com/A30Tn7fE
[17:29:00] <cornellhub> so when I click the "surf" button
[17:29:11] <cornellhub> it should wait 1.5s
[17:29:14] <cornellhub> scroll down 400px
[17:29:18] <cornellhub> 17 times, right?
[17:30:17] <cornellhub> it only works the first time, then fails
[17:30:26] <cornellhub> 18Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[17:30:59] <cornellhub> any ideas?
[17:31:22] <cornellhub> this could be pretty cool if it worked
[17:33:30] <cornellhub> ?
[17:42:32] <cornellhub> agh

[17:49:01] <cornellhub> well i'll be here for a while
[17:58:51] <cornellhub> now i have this
[17:58:52] <cornellhub> http://pastebin.com/6czPsJNi
[18:01:01] <Lucky--> whats the easiest way to get the get parameters a page was called with?
[18:02:39] <bung> im trying to write a small plugin, but I dont really know the best way to have some variables that my private methods can access
[18:02:49] <bung> not sure if that makes sense, having a hard time finding the right search terms
[18:03:46] <bung> for example, in a carousel plugin, a private onClick method wants to know if something is already animating
[18:03:55] <bung> im not sure where or how i'd store that info properly so i have access to it
[18:03:57] <bung> http://pastebin.com/S2EHAbPm
[18:04:34] <bung> line 56 of that paste
[18:04:47] <bung> this is kinda a long question, maybe i should just post on SO
[18:20:35] <cornellhub> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10694634/im-trying-to-make-an-iterative-jquery-scrolling-animation-that-scrolls-through
[18:20:38] <cornellhub> here's mine
[18:31:57] <iLogic> Can you guys tell me why are those <li> on on the listview <ul> are looking so weird on this jquery mobile site? http://eutopia.com.br/op/
[18:32:56] <tw2113> weird in what way?
[18:33:07] <iLogic> looks like it has some very extra padding
[18:33:15] <iLogic> doesn't look like the default at all
[18:33:42] <tw2113> i think the gradients may be tricking your eyes
[18:33:56] <cornellhub> what's that animation you have when clicking a link?
[18:34:16] <cornellhub> oh, you're not actually opening a new page
[18:34:51] <iLogic> I just started messing with it, but it doesn't look right at all
[18:34:59] <iLogic> looks like it has some extra padding
[18:35:50] <tw2113> looks fine on the padding front, in firefox aurora
[18:36:30] <cornellhub> if you don't like it juts edit the css!
[18:37:27] <iLogic> yeah, I know that I can do that..
[18:37:42] <iLogic> but it's supposed to get the default look
[18:38:37] <iLogic> as you see here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-search-inset.html
[18:39:26] <iLogic> the default <li> has 40px height
[18:39:36] <iLogic> mine is getting 73px
[18:39:43] <iLogic> how can you not see that?!
[18:40:16] <iLogic> for some reason mine is getting a weird padding
[18:40:18] <tw2113> ah, now that i have an example, i do see differences
[18:40:28] <tw2113> but for when i was seeing just yours, it looked rather balanced
[18:41:06] <tw2113> maybe you're missing some classes
[18:41:14] <tw2113> <div data-role="page" class="type-index">
[18:41:39] <tw2113> <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
[18:41:54] <iLogic> ok, this is really weird
[18:42:02] <iLogic> i just pasted the example above on my code
[18:42:23] <iLogic> and it's loading the search bar inside another search bar
[18:42:36] <tw2113> the example page also has the listview outside of the page data-role
[18:42:46] <iLogic> ok, I think got it
[18:43:06] <iLogic> lol
[18:43:09] <iLogic> damn
[18:43:23] <tw2113> which part was it?
[18:43:27] <iLogic> sleep deprivation plays strange tricks on your mind
[18:43:40] <iLogic> I was loading the scripts and css twice
[18:43:48] <iLogic> once on the header and again below the footer
[18:44:03] <tw2113> it happens
[18:44:07] <iLogic> haha
[18:44:13] <iLogic> thanks for your attention anyway
[19:14:24] <Fenikkusu> Can someone explain to me why this might not work, in that the appended items do not appear in the DOM? http://pastebin.com/d4EPVMt9
[19:15:55] <Fenikkusu> Ahh Blast I type it wrong. Oh well, you get the point.
[19:19:03] <shoky_> because you're not adding any of those elemtns to the dom
[19:19:06] <shoky_> only to each other
[19:19:33] <Fenikkusu> Despite the element already existing on the DOM?
[19:19:58] <shoky_> ahh didn't notice the div is a selector sorry
[19:20:19] <shoky_> so.. that should work
[19:20:36] <shoky_> but
[19:20:40] <Fenikkusu> That's what I thought as well. Must mean I have an error deeper...blast.
[19:20:43] <Fenikkusu> Thank You
[19:20:49] <shoky_> you're adding a <ul> to a <ul> ...
[19:21:32] <Fenikkusu> Yes, I typed that up directly and realized afterwards I did that xX
[19:21:50] <shoky_> o
[19:24:29] <Fenikkusu> Ahh, missed a '.' on the prior selector. Go figure.

[19:47:57] <rodd> Hi, I constantly retrieve new elements from ajax, and both these new elements and the ones that were already present in the page, are tied to a plugin. My question is, what is a good way (non-repetitive) to bind these elements to a specific plugin? exemple:
[19:47:58] <rodd> http://pastebin.com/WFJek1jM
[19:49:25] <rodd> perhaps setting a custom event bind?
[19:50:29] <devilsbackyard> rodd bind them as the ajax success callback function
[19:52:08] <rodd> devilsbackyard what if, like in the last example, i remove one .range node from newElements, I would have to bind twice
[19:52:21] <rodd> that doesnt look good
[19:54:30] <devilsbackyard> rodd, you will have to do it twice if you are loading them through ajax
[19:54:59] <devilsbackyard> one at the document.ready and other as the ajax success callback
[19:55:50] <rodd> in other words, ill have to do it for every new element?
[19:56:05] <rodd> be it at ready, ajax call, etc
[20:01:26] <aphid> does anyone else picture success kid every time they use a success callback?
[20:02:52] <tw2113> can't say i do
[20:03:35] <aphid> ...oh.
[20:04:07] <tw2113> more power to those who do

[20:57:07] <Houlihan> Hey
[20:57:14] <AngryAsian> Yo
[20:57:33] <Houlihan> Anybody here have any experience with form validation?
[20:58:25] <AngryAsian> what's the problem?
[20:59:03] <Houlihan> I have a form-based user interface with a number of buttons. There are several buttons for different options that must be greyed out until the form is completely filled out. There's also a "Cancel" button which must remain active at all times.
[20:59:34] <Houlihan> The buttons are CSS-formatted DIVs
[21:00:01] <Houlihan> with a sprite background that shifts according to their status: active, hover, or greyed-out
[21:00:33] <Houlihan> Let me grab my laptop and I'll pastebin the code that I have so far
[21:00:57] <AngryAsian> okies. neato. sounds pretty easy just give me some code and I'll fix it. :P
[21:01:34] <Houlihan> OK give me a minutye
[21:01:42] <Houlihan> thanks, by the way
[21:03:40] <[Tyrant]> How do you select an li.class elements excluding one with a certain class?
[21:03:56] <tw2113> ?not

[21:04:02] <tw2113> eh

[21:04:31] <abjorn> oh no, where is bot-t :(
[21:05:04] <roddd> in document ready, I have: $('.element').bind('something', function() {}); - If after I load new elements from an ajax call, will this work? $('.element', newElementsFromAjax).bind('something'); ?
[21:05:35] <Houlihan> AngryAsian: how about I paste this code into JS Fiddle?
[21:05:46] <roddd> sorry
[21:05:48] <Houlihan> seems easier than messing with pastebin
[21:05:57] <roddd> $('.element', newElementsFromAjax).trigger('something');
[21:06:07] <tw2113> jsfiddle > pastebin
[21:06:14] <tw2113> especially when debugging js
[21:06:28] <Cork> roddd: yes it will, you might want to check delegate though
[21:06:32] <Houlihan> Agreed. JS Fiddle kicks ass
[21:06:39] <Cork> (and the new on function)
[21:06:59] <roddd> thanks, Cork I will look into that
[21:07:05] <Cork> ?on
[21:07:06] <caniuse> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:10:53] <psyolus> : Is there any way to get at secure cookies with javascript?
[21:11:01] <Cork> no
[21:11:08] <Cork> thats the point of secure cookies
[21:11:15] <Cork> http only
[21:13:00] <AngryAsian> Houlihan erm.. i was doing other stuff. Did you get it into jsfiddle?
[21:13:19] <psyolus> If only extensions could be exceptions. :/
[21:13:38] <AngryAsian> just put the html in the html place, the css in the css (no need for <style> tags in there) and javascript in the javascript (no need for <script> in there)
[21:14:03] <AngryAsian> and the in the left pick whatever js framework you want to load (jQuery i'd guess in your case)
[21:14:22] <AngryAsian> of course we wont have your images fro the buttons but that's fine
[21:25:49] <Ziber> I'm just starting out teaching myself the basics of jQuery, and I'm running into a problem with .animate(). http://sandbox.liber.in/jquery
[21:26:25] <Ziber> My previous tests have worked fine, and it is my understanding that through the use of .animate() I can dynamically change CSS attributes, so I tried text-decoration:underline.
[21:28:04] <Cork> Ziber: animate won't be able to animate text-decoration, it can't have any intermediate values
[21:28:24] <Cork> (text-decoration can't that is)
[21:28:28] <Ziber> alright, I've updated it to fontSize, one that I see in an example on api.jquery.com.
[21:28:35] <Ziber> Still no luck though.
[21:28:45] <Cork> "Not Found"
[21:28:54] <Ziber> Really?
[21:33:14] <Back2Basics>         .html(ajax_load)
[21:33:15] <Back2Basics>         .load(loadUrl, {language: "php", version: 5});
[21:33:24] <Back2Basics> is that one statement? ^
[21:34:04] <Cork> .load will put the response in the bound element yes
[21:34:10] <Cork> if thats what you mean
[21:36:45] <Ziber> whats "missing exponent" mean?
[21:36:46] <Back2Basics> .load is the continuation of the .html statement
[21:37:48] <Cork> Back2Basics: ah, ajax_load is a placeholder while the content is loaded?
[21:38:02] <Cork> then yes, it can be chained
[21:38:12] <Back2Basics> it's from http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/5-ways-to-make-ajax-calls-with-jquery/
[21:38:59] <snover> if you are using $.fn.load to inject html, you are killing puppies
[21:39:03] <snover> jtlyk
[21:39:16] <Back2Basics> snover: I'm not killing puppies then
[21:47:05] <vl1234> gud morning frnds

[21:52:20] <vl1234> Trsnsport.send       after getting this execution its all gone and come back to the last page
[21:52:55] <vl1234> am getting from error from jquery lib
[21:59:48] <Ukto> hey guys, why does the txtbox.val() not give me any responses in this? http://pastebin.com/vsaDeXCH
[22:00:57] <ArtificialEX> i have yet to find one example of css transform finishing where it ends
[22:03:29] <Ukto> apparently, if I switch to keyup it works
[22:03:31] <Ukto> but only once
[22:03:49] <Ukto> so if i keep typing in the textbox, it only triggers on the first character typed. ?
[22:04:09] <Cork> Ukto: keypress and keydown triggers before the text has been set in the field
[22:04:18] <Cork> so it will be one character behind
[22:04:47] <Cork> html5 input or keyup will trigger when the character has been added
[22:04:58] <Cork> keyup doens't trigger for repeated keys though
[22:05:33] <Ukto> so I need a repeatable keyup
[22:05:54] <Cork> keyup should work unless you hold the key down
[22:08:41] <Jagan_> Hi.
[22:09:45] <Jagan_> How to make jquery dailog box always on center while scrolling too?
[22:10:27] <Cork> thats tough, you could try changing the dialogs position to fixed
[22:10:42] <Ukto> Cork: using keyup, i press 4 3 times, it only trigers the first
[22:11:00] <Cork> ?p @ Ukto
[22:11:01] <bot-t> Ukto, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:14:41] <Ziber> How can I find out if a checkbox is checked or not?
[22:16:17] <Back2Basics> Ziber: .val()  I think
[22:17:11] <Cork> prop('checked')
[22:17:24] <Cork> or is(':checked')
[22:18:58] <Ziber> and for the event, .click()?
[22:19:24] <Cork> what do you mean?
[22:19:44] <Ziber> i wanna trigger something when its clicked, $("input:checkbox#name").click(function() { })?
[22:20:09] <Cork> if you have the element's id just use #id
[22:20:13] <Cork> no need for the rest
[22:20:37] <Cork> but yes, thats a click event listner
[22:21:28] <diverdude> anyone knows if its possible to even set any kind of options for the lightbox lib?
[22:21:50] <Ziber> I'm trying: $("#options").click(function() { $("p#output").text($("#options").is(':checked')); });
[22:21:53] <Ziber> to no avail.
[22:22:22] <Ziber> nvm, had a typo
[22:22:23] <Ziber> lol
[22:22:24] <Cork> Ziber: an id can only exist once
[22:22:32] <Cork> so no need for the element in the selector
[22:22:42] <Cork> $("p#output") <--
[22:22:54] <Ziber> what should i have instead?
[22:22:58] <Cork> nothing
[22:23:02] <Cork> $("#output")
[22:23:10] <Ziber> ooh
[22:23:13] <Cork> if it exists multible times, use class
[22:23:13] <Ziber> i get what you mean
[22:23:29] <Ziber> how do i select all items in a class?
[22:23:39] <Ziber> $(".class")?
[22:23:42] <Cork> yes
[22:23:46] <Ziber> alright
[22:23:51] <Ziber> this is starting to make sense to me
[22:24:04] <Cork> its the same syntax you use in css
[22:24:13] <Ukto> Cork: sorry, i cant get jquery code to run on jfiddle
[22:24:21] <Ziber> i see, thanks
[22:25:04] <Cork> Ukto: do you have a link ( to jsfiddle)?
[22:26:17] <Ukto> http://jsfiddle.net/ydsdj/
[22:27:30] <Ukto> nm, seems to be working on jsfiddle
[22:27:34] <Ukto> but it doesnt on my own site
[22:27:35] <Cork> Ukto: http://jsfiddle.net/ydsdj/1/
[22:27:43] <Ukto> yeah, i didnt have jquery selected heh
[22:28:19] <Cork> you don't want replaceWith
[22:28:29] <Cork> that will remove #txtbox
[22:28:35] <Cork> use html
[22:28:44] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ydsdj/2/
[22:31:11] <Ziber> It's ajax that I need to take values in a form, process them with PHP and get a return value, right?
[22:31:37] <diverdude> anybody used th lightbox2 lib before? How do i set the image button paths?
[22:32:00] <Cork> Ziber: if you need to run server code after the page has been loaded, yes you need to use ajax
[22:33:25] <tw2113> i have to admit, i'm curious of Crockford leaving yahoo is being perceived as a rat jumping ship
[22:34:25] <Ziber> Cork: alright, thanks
[22:34:35] <Ziber> thats my next step, after i play around with jquery some more
[22:37:31] <Ukto> Cork: to be able to do math on numbers in two check boxes, do I have to convert the .val() to an int somehow ?
[22:37:37] <Ukto> otherwise I get NaN
[22:37:47] <Cork> Ukto: yes
[22:37:55] <Ukto> http://jsfiddle.net/ydsdj/3/
[22:37:56] <Cork> ?eval "10" + 16
[22:37:57] <bot-t> Cork: "1016"
[22:38:10] <Cork> ?eval parseInt("43", 10) + 16
[22:38:11] <bot-t> Cork: 59
[22:38:31] <Cork> ?eval 16 + 43
[22:38:32] <bot-t> Cork: 59
[22:38:35] <Cork> opps
[22:38:37] <Cork> ?eval 16 + "43"
[22:38:37] <bot-t> Cork: "1643"
[22:40:00] <Ukto> hmm, I tried using the ParseInt() on the .val() and it didnt seem to make a difference
[22:40:10] <Ukto> each one individually
[22:40:49] <Cork> its parseInt not ParseInt
[22:41:01] <Ukto> er yeah
[22:41:06] <Ukto> i just mistyped
[22:41:11] <Cork> pb?
[22:42:01] <Ukto> http://jsfiddle.net/ydsdj/4/
[22:43:22] <Houlihan> what's a good JQuery table plugin that can do scrolling, multi-column sorting and row striping while allowing multiple lines per record a'la rowspan?
[22:43:46] <Cork> Ukto: http://jsfiddle.net/ydsdj/5/
[22:43:48] <Houlihan> datatables gets broken by multiple lines in a single row
[22:44:05] <Cork> Ukto: id selectors need the # infront of them
[22:50:09] <Ukto> Cork: oh crap, missed that
[22:50:25] <Ukto> cork: hmm, how can I get it to do math with decimal points?
[22:50:32] <Ukto> 4.005 * 2 = 8
[22:50:46] <Ukto> btw, thanks for all the help
[22:53:27] <Houlihan> I have some redundant functions to initialize a number of dialog boxes, and I was planning to do all that work in a for loop using an array to plug in the values. Is that a good approach?
[22:53:44] <Houlihan> Here's the code I'm trying to optimize: http://pastebin.com/W3VfTPg2
[23:01:45] <Ziber> Huh. None of this appears to work in IE.
[23:05:38] <tw2113> what does work in IE?
[23:05:47] <joo_p23> if my div has data-id=20.....<div data-id="20"></div> ... how do I select that div?
[23:06:17] <Houlihan> give it a regular ID
[23:06:28] <joo_p23> ok thx
[23:07:37] <CaMer0n> hello! any jQuery gurus around?
[23:07:47] <tw2113> just peons
[23:07:55] <tw2113> may want to ask anyway
[23:09:15] <CaMer0n> okay thanks.
[23:09:17] <CaMer0n> I am trying to replace an old function without changing the html markup. ie. <a href='#' onclick='expandit(this)' >click</a>without success..
[23:09:53] <CaMer0n> So basically.. how can I recreate this function using jQuery instead of old javascript?
[23:10:42] <Milos> Is there a shorter version of removeClass('error').removeClass('ok');
[23:11:00] <Milos> can it be separated by comma, space, what?
[23:11:35] <Zhy> removeClass('error ok'); should do it
[23:18:29] <diverdude> any suggestions for a lightbox like library where it is possible to set the location of the image buttons and other used resources?
[23:20:32] <tw2113> find an already done one and edit the css?
[23:20:52] <CalebIO> what do you consider "other used resources"?  Like the close button?
[23:20:53] <tw2113> just an initial thought
[23:24:56] <Whirl3d> so, when writing a gallery or slideshow from scratch...what is the preferred method for keeping track of the "current" slide/image?
[23:27:17] <TomWij> var current?
[23:27:47] <Whirl3d> as in a global variable?
[23:28:27] <Rajko> hey
[23:28:40] <Rajko> im doing $('someimg').attr('src', 'newurl);
[23:28:45] <Whirl3d> hey
[23:28:45] <CalebIO> depends on if you want to have the ability to have multiple galleries/slideshows on one page.
[23:28:53] <CalebIO> if you want to think about it in an abstract way.. or a singular way.
[23:28:54] <Rajko> however, this makes it scale all weird if the new src is different size
[23:28:59] <Rajko> how do i make the img element resize itself
[23:29:35] <Whirl3d> Rajko, create a new Image element, then once loaded swap them out
[23:30:07] <Ziber> so whats the deal with IE and jquery?
[23:30:29] <Whirl3d> CalebIO, thanks for the reply. I am hoping to abstract it out as much as possible.
[23:30:33] <juha_> so whats the problem with ie and jquery?
[23:30:36] <Rajko> Whirl3d, how do this
[23:30:51] <CalebIO> Whirld3d, jQuery plugin wise abstraction?
[23:31:21] <Whirl3d> Rajko....var image=new Image(); var img=$(Image); img.load(loadhandler).attr("src", newurl);
[23:32:01] <Whirl3d> CalebIO, yeah. basically. It seems like I need the same basic functionality ALL the time:
[23:32:20] <Whirl3d> something where I have the "current" element and methods for showing/hiding it
[23:33:13] <Whirl3d> Menu's use this concept, slideshows, content handlers, pretty much it's the most common pattern I have found and yet there's no clear way to make this happen consistently
[23:34:36] <CalebIO> how are you wanting to provide it the "map" on which to proceed by?  image1, image2, image3... do you want to define a "generic" DOM structure the plugin can read from?
[23:34:44] <Rajko> Whirl3d, what do i do in the load handler
[23:34:55] <CalebIO> Meaning you create a div with a class called my-slideshow.. and then proceed to figure out the "map" from there?
[23:35:21] <Whirl3d> Rajko, in the load handler, you would say $("originalimage).replaceWith(img);
[23:36:58] <Whirl3d> CalebIO, I was thinking about something where you would select your elements in an array and then declare them a "group" whereby any of them could access the "make current" method and they all would know what to do
[23:37:09] <Rajko> Whirl3d, still does the exact same thing
[23:37:32] <Whirl3d> Rajko, you need to create a jsfiddle so we have something to look at
[23:37:34] <CalebIO> Whirl3d not the way I would personally do it, but that would work.
[23:37:43] <Whirl3d> How would you do it?
[23:38:42] <CalebIO> one sec and I'll write it up for you how I would
[23:39:01] <Whirl3d> wow. Thanks a ton. I really appreciate your input.
[23:39:37] <CalebIO> http://pastie.org/3948520
[23:39:46] <Rajko> Whirl3d, worked in firefox
[23:39:48] <Rajko> not in chrome
[23:39:51] <CalebIO> So basically I'd take that.. that to me is defined that I literally want to go through the images 1, 2, and 3...
[23:39:53] <Whirl3d> Rajko, basically, when you load the image in your load handler, you can resize it, manipulate it as much as you want before afffecting the dom
[23:40:05] <Rajko> image shrinks by 20% after the original gets replaced
[23:40:07] <Rajko> for some reason
[23:40:07] <CalebIO> So that's an example of the DOM.. now the JS..
[23:40:16] <Rajko> maybe some weird div fitting
[23:40:32] <CalebIO> (I'll PM you Whirl3d)
[23:52:26] <Ziber> I want to post some values from a form into PHP and load the result of that PHP back to variable. How can I do that?
[23:54:49] <CalebIO> I'm guessing since we're talking jQuery you're wanting to do it via AJAX?
[23:55:35] <Ziber> Yes.
[23:56:39] <CalebIO> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[23:56:52] <CalebIO> then use a success callback to handle the data.
[23:57:00] <Ziber> I tried $.load("script.php", { variable: $("#values").val() }, function(data) { if (data) { // do stuff } }); but didnt work
[23:57:40] <CalebIO> well $.load doesn't POST..
[23:57:49] <CalebIO> is your PHP expecting a POST?
[23:57:55] <Ziber> Yes.
[23:58:02] <Ziber> I wanted to do this via post.
[23:58:09] <Ziber> Which is why the URL seems helpful.
[23:58:27] <Ziber> That snippet is just me guessing.
[23:58:59] <Cork> $.ajax({ url: "script.php", data: { variable: $('#values').val() }, type: 'post' }).success(function(data) {  });
[23:59:32] <DarkSector> Hello, I am using Sijax and I've set my application to delete an entry from the db if I click on a link and send a request. I want to know how can I update the results without having to refresh the page.
[23:59:49] <Ziber> If I had multiple variables that I was feeding the script, how do I access each one individual from the resulting data variable?
