[00:00:08] <Eviltwin> It does increment
[00:00:14] <Eviltwin> Try clicking the top row of buttons
[00:00:58] <raj> no
[00:01:01] <raj> top row is always 4
[00:01:17] <Eviltwin> i starts at 0
[00:01:37] <raj> oh, wait, bottom doesn't increment either
[00:01:51] <raj> but the bottom shows the correct button index
[00:02:01] <raj> top row shows 4 no matter what
[00:02:05] <Eviltwin> So let's say I have this
[00:02:16] <Eviltwin> var i = 0; while(i < 4) { i++; } console.log(i)
[00:02:19] <Eviltwin> What will get logged?
[00:02:33] <raj> 1
[00:02:38] <raj> 0
[00:02:41] <raj> oops
[00:02:42] <raj> 0
[00:02:42] <raj> 1
[00:02:43] <raj> 2
[00:02:44] <raj> 3
[00:02:48] <Eviltwin> No
[00:02:53] <Eviltwin> The log is outside the loop
[00:02:54] <Eviltwin> Right after it
[00:02:59] <Eviltwin> So it only runs once
[00:03:00] <raj> oh
[00:03:01] <raj> right
[00:03:04] <raj> so just 3
[00:03:10] <Eviltwin> Nope
[00:03:38] <Eviltwin> Just 4
[00:03:52] <raj> how?
[00:03:59] <Eviltwin> The code between the {}'s gets run while i < 4
[00:04:06] <Eviltwin> When it first runs i = 0
[00:04:07] <raj> oh
[00:04:08] <raj> it rnu
[00:04:10] <raj> run
[00:04:11] <raj> right
[00:04:14] <raj> nice
[00:04:21] <raj> got it
[00:04:30] <Eviltwin> This same thing is happening with the for loop here: http://jsfiddle.net/eRdzM/
[00:04:49] <raj> and this for loop in your fiddle is finishing off before click
[00:04:51] <Eviltwin> All of the click handlers refer to the same i
[00:04:52] <Eviltwin> Yup
[00:04:54] <Eviltwin> Exactly
[00:05:22] <Eviltwin> So they all alert 4 because that's the value after the for loop
[00:05:36] <Eviltwin> Now with the $.each
[00:05:43] <Eviltwin> For each index a new function call happens
[00:05:47] <raj> so any variables set within a for loop have the same scope as variables defined at the same level as the for-loop
[00:05:54] <Eviltwin> That new function call creates new variables
[00:06:02] <Eviltwin> A new "i" and a new "name"
[00:06:15] <Eviltwin> raj: Yes, it's as if they were declared outside
[00:06:36] <Eviltwin> Unless you define them inside a function inside the loop
[00:07:35] <raj> got it
[00:07:44] <raj> but inside a for loop i can only have function expressions
[00:08:00] <Eviltwin> Only have function expressions?
[00:08:06] <raj> voided functions
[00:08:25] <raj> oh no
[00:08:27] <raj> that's a conditional
[00:09:29] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/eRdzM/1/
[00:09:32] <Eviltwin> I've added a third form there
[00:09:57] <Eviltwin> It defines an anonymous function inside the loop an executes it
[00:10:19] <Eviltwin> Because there's now a function call for each loop
[00:10:26] <Eviltwin> It makes new copies of those variables
[00:10:47] <raj> any function within a forloop must be within ( ) or voided, no?
[00:11:22] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure what you mean by that
[00:12:20] <raj> if I have a function within a for loop, can i set it equal to a variable within the loop?
[00:12:43] <Eviltwin> Set a variable equal to it?
[00:13:09] <raj> basically can I have a function without parens surrounding it, or being preceded by `void`
[00:13:17] <raj> within a for loop
[00:13:38] <Eviltwin> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/eRdzM/2/
[00:14:11] <raj> oh, well, that answers that
[00:14:39] <raj> Eviltwin, so conditions just can't have functions that aren't surrounded by parens or preceded by void?:
[00:14:56] <raj> *conditionals
[00:15:06] <Eviltwin> Like > < == etc?
[00:15:21] <raj> ya if/else
[00:16:03] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/aYTSH/
[00:16:57] <raj> i meant having a function at the same level as your alerts
[00:17:25] <qMan2> Hi
[00:18:04] <Eviltwin> Oh, are you asking if you can conditionally define a function?
[00:18:18] <qMan2> Would need a little bit of help, what would be the best way to make an image slideshow, where the images is slided in from left to right / right to left? Best way = speed optimised
[00:18:49] <raj> right
[00:18:57] <Eviltwin> Functions get "hoisted"
[00:19:11] <Eviltwin> http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function.scopes
[00:19:13] <raj> even within if/else?
[00:19:18] <Eviltwin> Scroll down to the part about hoisting
[00:19:19] <fRAiLtY-> If I just wanted to send foo and bar to ajax in the data field, what's the correct line of code, data:...
[00:19:21] <raj> k
[00:19:24] <raj> i understand
[00:19:37] <Eviltwin> They get hoisted outside, it's as if they were defined at the top of the function they're inside
[00:19:37] <raj> thank you for the explanations Eviltwin :)
[00:19:44] <raj> twas really good
[00:20:06] <Eviltwin> I know my stuff and I like to help others understand
[00:21:22] <john2x> hi. can I select an :after element with jquery? i have in my css an :after for a header, and I'd like to apply some javascript to the :after part..
[00:21:48] <Cork> john2x: not really
[00:21:52] <Eviltwin> john2x: Don't think so, no
[00:21:56] <Eviltwin> It's a psuedo element
[00:21:58] <Cork> you would have to modify the stylesheate rules
[00:22:02] <john2x> aww
[00:22:03] <Eviltwin> It's not really an element
[00:22:04] <Cork> *sheet
[00:22:16] <Cork> john2x: window.StyleSheets
[00:23:42] <john2x> ok. plan b. I used :after to place a little icon right beside the header. But now I need to put some javascript on that icon. :after isn't feasible anymore. any tips on how to properly place a small icon beside a header?
[00:24:13] <Eviltwin> john2x: Create it and use .insertAfter or .after to add it in the right place
[00:26:11] <fRAiLtY-> I'm trying to send to ajax this: id/testsend with this: data:"id/"+testsend,
[00:26:17] <fRAiLtY-> But it says testsend it undefiend
[00:26:20] <fRAiLtY-> It's just text?
[00:28:02] <Eviltwin> Don't really have enough context
[00:28:50] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: in the second version testsend needs to be a varaible
[00:29:11] <fRAiLtY-> Ah yeah
[00:29:12] <fRAiLtY-> got it
[00:29:14] <fRAiLtY-> duh
[00:29:15] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: or you need to do data:"id/"+"testsend"
[00:29:16] <Trisox> BAM JONGE
[00:29:24] <Cork> <_<
[00:29:26] <Cork> duh
[00:29:28] <Eviltwin> Or just data:"id/testsend"
[00:29:30] <Cork> hmm
[00:33:13] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/bdv6N/ sends data to the url as /matrix/ajax/update/?id/test whereas I need to lose the ? as I'm using magenta and the get parameter works as matrix/ajax/update/id/test instead where id = key and test = value, any ideas?
[00:33:42] <fRAiLtY-> Or is it just a case of dropping data: and appending to the URL?
[00:33:50] <Eviltwin> Done: http://jsfiddle.net/bdv6N/1/
[00:33:51] <Eviltwin> Yes, it is
[00:34:59] <fRAiLtY-> Why is it you always think of these things the second after you ask the question :
[00:36:53] <beasty> morning
[00:36:55] <Eviltwin> That's why I ususally take a few extra seconds before asking :P
[00:37:03] <beasty> i have this var called 'foo.bar'
[00:37:18] <beasty> is there a way that i can write a eventlistener for when it changes ?
[00:38:20] <anli_> When I run a client side script in a asp.net project, the solution explorer spams me with "script block" treeview items, why?
[00:38:27] <Eviltwin> beasty: You can call a function every time you change it
[00:38:30] <Eviltwin> Other than that, no
[00:38:51] <beasty> watch ?
[00:44:49] <raj> I'm betting there's an easier way to do what I want
[00:45:03] <Eviltwin> beasty: http://jsfiddle.net/j8yDR/
[00:45:06] <Eviltwin> How's that?
[00:49:19] <Xotix> how can i prefet jquery/browser to load e.g. an img? e.g. $(html) shouldn't load img's if there are some in the html
[00:49:48] <Eviltwin> Xotix: They need to be added to the document
[00:49:54] <Eviltwin> The body
[00:50:29] <Xotix> Eviltwin, what? I want to prevent it from loading cause the src will be wrong for 100%.
[00:51:00] <Eviltwin> Do var div = $("<div>").append(htmlContainingImgs);
[00:51:16] <Eviltwin> It'll be in a separate document fragment
[00:51:23] <Eviltwin> So they won't load
[00:51:33] <anli_> If anyone here is using visual studio, please help me with this solution explorer artefact: http://imgur.com/aEq5v
[00:51:33] <Eviltwin> Won't try to load
[00:51:46] <Xotix> ok thanks I'm gonna try that
[00:52:07] <Eviltwin> You can make your changes, deatch the elements, and put them into the body
[00:52:12] <Eviltwin> Once they're ready
[00:52:40] <raj> I'd like for every select element that is nextAll to another, to use its value in removing options from prevAll select elements
[00:52:50] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/28/
[00:53:53] <Eviltwin> Hmm?
[00:53:58] <unknown_had> hey all I am trying to get the name of image over which the click() event is done but not be able to do so.
[00:54:00] <Eviltwin> I didn't follow your explanation
[00:54:12] <Xotix> unknown_had:  use this
[00:54:39] <raj> basically, if an option has been selected, I want it knocked out of the list of options for all prevAll elements
[00:54:43] <Xotix> $('img').click($(this)))
[00:55:25] <Flo0815> good morning guys
[00:55:39] <raj> i have like a million for loops in trying to accomplish this
[00:59:11] <Eviltwin> raj: Can they change higher ones?
[00:59:20] <Eviltwin> Can they change a higher one to the value a lower one currently has?
[00:59:47] <raj> higher/lower in terms of precedence?
[01:00:17] <Eviltwin> Sorry, it's late here and I'm not quite following what the expected behavior should be
[01:00:55] <raj> when a selectbox is added, it should not contain options with values that match any of the nextAll elements
[01:01:24] <Eviltwin> By which you mean the <selects> below it?
[01:02:19] <Eviltwin> Actually I gotta go, sorry
[01:02:22] <Eviltwin> Maybe someone else can help you out
[01:02:29] <Eviltwin> G'night
[01:02:51] <Xotix> Eviltwin, it still tries to load them.  http://tinyw.in/E4cZ
[01:03:45] <Eviltwin> I thought they came in through AJAX
[01:04:04] <raj> np thanks :)
[01:05:16] <Xotix> Eviltwin was that for me?
[01:09:00] <Cork> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/QgFMe/5/
[01:09:31] <Cork> Xotix: when you run map on a selection it will jquery wrap the results
[01:09:39] <Cork> so use $.map instead
[01:09:41] <Flo0815> Cork: remember my css-problem yesterday with :first-child?
[01:09:49] <Cork> Flo0815: yes
[01:10:12] <Flo0815> Cork: it works on classes too, the problem were the other divs inside the wrapper
[01:10:26] <Flo0815> Cork: that confused the css
[01:10:28] <Flo0815> somehow
[01:10:44] <Cork> Flo0815: well i didn't explain it correctly either
[01:10:58] <Xotix> ok thanks i'll try it
[01:11:01] <Cork> Flo0815: :first-child matches the first element
[01:11:18] <Cork> its a true or false kind of selector
[01:11:45] <Cork> it doens't filter based on the rest of the selector
[01:17:45] <Xotix> Cork i still get 404 error.
[01:19:00] <Cork> Xotix: try prop('src')
[01:19:33] <Cork> Xotix: btw where do you get the error from?
[01:20:55] <Xotix> from $(myHtml) which i need to use find
[01:21:33] <Cork> that shouldn't trigger loading the images
[01:21:38] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/EQ31zhSQ
[01:21:43] <stagen> whats the declaration for adding text to an element?
[01:21:59] <Xotix> stagen append?
[01:22:00] <Cork> ?.html @ stagen
[01:22:00] <bot-t> stagen, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[01:22:14] <stagen> Ow yea, thanks.
[01:23:17] <stagen> Well actually, I want to add a bit of text to an element, if that makes more sense.
[01:25:09] <Xotix> Cork, if i outcomment erything in the callback http://pastebin.com/EQ31zhSQ and add $(data) 404 errors are thrown. without $(data) no errors are thrown
[01:25:10] <anli_> Is there a way to check if two elements are one and the same beside elem1.get(0) == elem2.get(0)?
[01:25:18] <anli_> A shorter way?
[01:25:34] <Xotix> Cork, someone said, $() actualyl creates html elements and due to that it gets loaded.
[01:26:00] <Cork> anli_: jqelem1[0] === jqelem2[0]
[01:26:26] <Cork> Xotix: it creates a document, but until you attach it to a document that renders it shoudn't load
[01:26:33] <anli_> cork: So there is no equals method?
[01:26:43] <Cork> anli_: no
[01:26:52] <anli_> Its a bit strange :)
[01:27:02] <Cork> you can filter though
[01:27:06] <raj> Cork, is there a better way to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/28/ so lower precedence items (those selects above) conform to any changes a higher precedence item has had? (thereby removing options that have already been used by higher precedence selects)
[01:27:09] <anli_> But then the jQuery team maybe thought they needed to handle arrays with elements
[01:27:14] <Cork> anli_: btw is should do it
[01:27:25] <Cork> anli_: jqelm1.is(jqelm2)
[01:27:32] <anli_> Cool :)
[01:27:38] <anli_> Trying
[01:28:00] <Xotix> Cork, but it does :) So how can i prevent it?
[01:28:11] <Cork> if it does that there you can't
[01:28:51] <Cork> Xotix: only option is to use regex
[01:29:26] <beasty> mm
[01:29:32] <beasty> mkay that was pretty evil
[01:29:48] <beasty> writing a regex to only match belgian numbers
[01:29:55] <beasty> and then send it out to turkey
[01:30:00] <Xotix> I'm rather goign to change my export and do it there, there i don't get 404 cause they exist. But it is a bit uglier. Hmm thanks. :)
[01:32:07] <anli_> What is a good way of unchecking a checkbox, beside cb.removeAttr('checked');?
[01:40:59] <qMan2> If I would like something similair to this site, www.skoda.se/kampanj where I got a slideshow where there is two different moving objects for each slide. How would I do something like that? New to jquery, so some sort of tips for functions etc to use would be great.

[01:50:55] <santosh> If Yes How ?
[01:51:41] <Cork> winforms?
[01:51:48] <Cork> you mean windows native forms?
[01:53:06] <jomofcw> Hello !

[01:54:31] <santosh> yes
[01:55:01] <Cork> santosh: only if they are elements in the page
[01:55:15] <Cork> santosh: can't say i've ever tried so ...
[01:57:32] <qMan2> I found a jquery slideshow, that I thought I modify. But the person that had made it did write everything on one line and called it slides.min.jquery.js
[01:57:54] <qMan2> Is there any parser that could parse it and put it on traditinoal format, or do I have to do it myself.
[01:57:57] <qMan2> Pretty long line :)
[01:59:18] <tw2113> find the slides.jquery.js version
[01:59:35] <tw2113> stop using the minified version to debug/hack on
[02:00:41] <qMan2> tw2113: cant find any non .mini. version
[02:00:44] <qMan2> thats the problem
[02:00:55] <tw2113> where did you get this one from?
[02:01:04] <qMan2> slidejs.com
[02:01:42] <jomofcw> OK my bad, was a script error.
[02:01:42] <tw2113> is it supposed to be an unstyled page?
[02:01:58] <qMan2> slidejs.com site?
[02:02:03] <qMan2> no that should be styled.
[02:02:09] <tw2113> http://slidesjs.com/ perhaps
[02:02:32] <qMan2> oh yeah
[02:02:35] <qMan2> sorry my bad
[02:03:29] <tw2113> looks like you have a slides.jquery.js in the source file
[02:03:33] <tw2113> right next to the minimized version
[02:04:00] <qMan2> have to check it again then. maybe I copied an example folder or such.
[02:04:17] <tw2113> http://slidesjs.com/downloads/slides.zip
[02:05:02] <qMan2> yeah, will play around with it instead.
[02:05:03] <qMan2> Thanks
[02:14:31] <aqeel> hi room
[02:23:16] <Gargoyle> morning peoples!
[02:23:21] <qMan2> I got this, http://agfoto.se/jerker/
[02:23:37] <qMan2> anyone know how I can modify it so that the solid-color hockey-player have its own slide speed
[02:23:47] <qMan2> it should be a little bit faster slide in on that one
[02:23:52] <qMan2> then the background image.
[02:24:41] <Gargoyle> How can I check if $domElement = $('#somethingthatdoesntexist') has an element? console tells me its "[]" but an if comparision for an empty array doesnt seem to work?
[02:25:48] <Cork> Gargoyle: your looking for .length > 0 ?
[02:26:06] <Cork> if($('#somethingthatdoesntexist').length > 0) { /* do something */ }
[02:26:51] <Gargoyle> Cork: Thanks! It's always obvious when someone points it out. (too early, need more caffiene)
[02:29:11] <qMan2> Any ideas on my problem? Irritating.
[02:30:39] <Cork> qMan2: you would have to separate them from the normal image
[02:31:15] <qMan2> Cork: It is two different images
[02:31:35] <Cork> qMan2: i mean you would have to not include them in the normal slite
[02:31:40] <Cork> *slide
[02:31:47] <qMan2> Ah
[02:31:54] <Cork> either do your own animation of them or a separat slide
[02:32:17] <Cork> (never used slider so not sure how you do it there)
[02:32:46] <qMan2> Cork: Have any other idea on how to make something similair? Im not forced to use slider if there is another solution.
[02:33:45] <stagen> Flash
[02:34:47] <Cork> qMan2: you could always bind an action to the prev/next and animate the position of the second image relative to its parent
[02:35:16] <Cork> qMan2: as long as you don't want too much of a difference between the to that should be farly simple
[02:35:23] <Cork> *two
[02:36:02] <qMan2> Only thing that is not optional in this slideshow is that there is two images sliding in at the same time but in different speedes. But always the same two on each slide.
[02:36:24] <qMan2> Trying to do some nice image gallery with sliding in boxes with image caption.
[02:36:43] <Cork> qMan2: and they should slide in the same direction?
[02:37:58] <qMan2> yes
[02:38:40] <qMan2> maybe this slider is not the best solution, but new to javascript / jquery and trying it out seams nice to make a image galleri in it. And
[02:39:05] <qMan2> so Im open for suggestions on other ways to solve it as well.
[02:39:32] <Cork> qMan2: i would do one of the two solutions
[02:39:57] <Cork> qMan2: put the overlay images in its own slider and run the different sliders ontop of eachother
[02:40:12] <Cork> qMan2: or do the slider myself
[02:40:24] <Cork> animate makse it farly simple
[02:41:27] <qMan2> animate is a standard jquery function?
[02:41:33] <Cork> ?.animate
[02:41:34] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[02:42:12] <qMan2> ah nice. Perhaps better to make it from the beginging my self if its not that hard.
[02:42:49] <Cork> if its worth the work depends on how much you want to go outside a normal slizer
[02:42:58] <Cork> *slider
[02:43:04] <qMan2> Cork: Dont need anything special
[02:43:26] <qMan2> but I have to really understand the slider.jquery.js library
[02:43:30] <Cork> well the elements sliding in different speeds are one :)
[02:43:33] <qMan2> if I should make it on top of each other
[02:43:44] <qMan2> Cork: Yeah except that
[02:43:54] <qMan2> :)

[02:46:18] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: as long as you've set the variable when the page renders, your doing it

[02:47:14] <anli_> Is there anyone getting the same runtime behavior as I get using jquery in visual studio? http://imgur.com/aEq5v
[02:49:02] <xec> anli_: no, did you put your javascript in a html file?
[02:49:57] <xec> or worse, in a newsletter? :)
[02:52:16] <qMan2> newsletter should only contain javascript if they are mallicous and contains bad code :)
[02:54:26] <martisj> how do i intercept the default action of a form button?
[02:54:41] <martisj> i need to ask a user for permissions from their facebook account, before i submit the form.
[02:54:53] <martisj> Any ideas or tips/hints would be very much appreciated;)
[02:56:03] <xec> ?submit @ martisj
[02:56:03] <bot-t> martisj, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[02:56:18] <martisj> xec: sweet :)
[02:56:19] <martisj> thnkas
[02:56:42] <martisj> hope it wasn't too much of an el stupido question...
[02:57:53] <xec> not at all, i'm not entirely sure how you would solve it tbh
[02:58:18] <martisj> xec: could i return false if the user doesn't authorize my application?
[02:58:57] <qMan2> Ok, I'm stuck. Dont know how to solev my slides problem.
[02:59:02] <qMan2> solve*
[02:59:14] <xec> martisj: do you know if the user authorized before the submit happens?
[03:00:34] <martisj> xec: i think the facebook.login dialog will let me do a callback function and then i can do stuff based on that.
[03:00:35] <martisj> hmmmm
[03:00:55] <martisj> i have to just close the dialog and redirect the user back to the current page with an alert maybe
[03:00:59] <martisj> I'll see what happens.
[03:01:11] <martisj> still have to add the event handler.
[03:01:19] <martisj> not easy with an mvc thing
[03:01:42] <martisj> *thing / patter
[03:01:42] <xec> you're probably not the first one to attempt this, maybe there's some decent facebook tutorials somewhere
[03:01:43] <martisj> n
[03:01:51] <martisj> xec should
[03:01:51] <martisj> be
[03:02:00] <martisj> still have to get to that part yet
[03:02:01] <martisj> :D
[03:11:04] <Deiu> Hello!
[03:11:44] <martisj> that's weird. eventhough i do return false; at the end of the callback for $('#myform_id').submit(function(){â€¦â€¦â€¦ return false;}); it still redirects to the form action page..
[03:11:48] <Deiu> Is there a way to trigger an event once dynamic elements of a page have finished loading? (dynamic = jquery / ajax stuff that gets appended to the page)

[03:29:04] <martisj> I'm not a prime example and don't always do this myself.
[03:29:08] <martisj> i try.
[03:31:22] <crem> If I create <img> node it won't try to load it until I insert the node to DOM-tree, will it?
[03:40:33] <gee> martisj: I have page in that left side will tell about me and right side will tell about my experience, my hobbies, my collections etc
[03:40:33] <mikkelb> Hello! I need to do a simple contact form - is there a nice and simple jQuery script for this?
[03:40:38] <ribot> hi
[03:40:53] <gee> for this i have tried with JQM
[03:41:17] <gee> in the index.html
[03:41:19] <ribot> if i do a $.post().error(function(e){... how can i alert the nature of an error?
[03:41:39] <gee> i have added a grid-a and two blocks
[03:41:46] <martisj> gee: do you have a working site one could look at?
[03:42:12] <martisj> gee: i didn't say I was going to help you, because frankly I don't know how to help you.
[03:42:25] <gee> martisj: now only im developing that..
[03:42:27] <martisj> Don't know what you're trying to do or what you are having errors with
[03:42:34] <gee> i dnt have any working site
[03:42:43] <gee> <div data-role="page" class="type-interior ui-page ui-body-c ui-page-active"> 	<div data-role="content"> 		<div class="ui-grid-a">                 			<div class="ui-block-a" style="padding-top:150px"><h1>About me</h1></div>                 			<div class="ui-block-b">                           			<div data-role="page" id="one">                             				<div data-role="content" >	 			                            		<p>ONE</p>	 			     
[03:42:48] <martisj> i guess a live site then
[03:42:55] <martisj> paste your code on pastie
[03:43:03] <martisj> jsfiddle.net
[03:46:12] <mikkelb> Is there a nice jQuery contact form?
[03:51:43] <martisj> only the one you make your self :D
[03:51:44] <martisj> mikkelb:
[03:52:29] <mikkelb> hehe
[03:52:41] <mikkelb> martisj: do you at least have a good starting point?
[03:53:09] <martisj> yeah there is some nice stuff at net.tutsplus.com
[03:53:13] <martisj> check it out
[03:53:21] <mikkelb> cool
[03:53:27] <mikkelb> http://jsfiddle.net/Uc2n4/ is all i got so far though
[03:54:37] <mikkelb> martisj: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/build-your-own-captcha-and-contact-form/ right?
[03:55:25] <martisj> could be
[03:55:33] <martisj> there is another one with ajax i think
[03:55:41] <fragy> hi. I have nested ul li structure. And I have a hover function for the top li tag, but it gets triggered by the bottom li's too. How do I fix this?
[03:57:43] <mikkelb> martisj: http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/learn-how-to-ajaxify-comment-forms/ ?
[03:59:13] <martisj> mikkelb: nope not that either
[04:00:16] <mikkelb> martisj: do you know how to narrow this search? http://net.tutsplus.com/?s=contact+form+ajax
[04:00:21] <mikkelb> gives me 146 pages!
[04:01:23] <martisj> yeah good luck :D
[04:01:32] <martisj> i can't remember and don't have time to find it
[04:08:55] <timing> Hi all! Is it possible to read all css properties from a css selector without the selector being in use? For example I have the following css: .area.area-awesome .slide { color: red }. I want to get the property something like this: getPropertiesBySelector('.area.area-awesome .slide').style.color;
[04:09:01] <timing> is this possible?
[04:09:28] <timing> so there is no element with that property (yet)
[04:11:30] <Zogot> timing. What are you trying to do exactly, as there may be a better solution
[04:11:42] <Zogot> timing, as the immediate solution is using .on()
[04:12:12] <timing> I want to preload all the background images which are set in any css file
[04:12:26] <timing> so I want to loop over all properties and check for the background property and preload that img
[04:12:46] <timing> I googled for this, but coundl't find anything dynamic
[04:13:32] <Zogot> timing: and what about just putting all images into a hidden box or so, from the server side
[04:14:20] <timing> http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/update_automatically_preload_images_from_css_with_jquery/ maybe this one?
[04:14:29] <timing> I don't know which images
[04:14:51] <timing> I think that script is what I want
[04:15:01] <Zogot> timing: aye appears to do exactly what you want :p
[04:15:28] <timing> yeah nice!
[04:15:34] <timing> thanks for thinking with me though :-)
[04:19:11] <timing> Looks like that thang works!
[04:20:30] <qMan2> Damn it, cant figure out how to make what I want. Anyone who could help me out please? Would need a slideshow that for each slides slides in 2 different images. At different speedes.
[04:20:45] <qMan2> The background a bit slower then the image in the front that should be rather quick.
[04:21:01] <Zogot> qMan2: and as a slideshow?
[04:21:06] <qMan2> Yes
[04:21:42] <qMan2> Best explained I guess an example would be, but cant find anyone really good other then this one. www.skoda.se/kampanj
[04:21:58] <qMan2> You see the background goes a bit slow and the car moves fast.
[04:22:21] <qMan2> Dont need all that styles or anything, just simple text button under the images is fine.
[04:22:32] <Zogot> qMan2: Really what you'll have I'll think is a slide of a containing div that holds its own images (most probabcut and transparent)...
[04:22:36] <Zogot> aye exactly as that link
[04:22:55] <Zogot> You can see, in the source, its a collection of images.  So the slideshow is 1 bit of JS
[04:22:56] <mikkelb> qMan2: http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/
[04:23:06] <Zogot> and the images going at a certain speed inwards is another
[04:24:06] <qMan2> Yeah, but as not a used programmer more of an designer I'm not that familliar with all that.
[04:24:09] <qMan2> code.
[04:24:27] <qMan2> But as a private project I cant take up any resources from the company or such for this :)
[04:24:41] <Zogot> qMan2: Then look into paralax plugins
[04:24:45] <Zogot> Its very similar
[04:25:03] <qMan2> Ok, thanks will do that.
[04:25:06] <Zogot> http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/ParallaxSlider/
[04:25:12] <Zogot> qMan2: something like that
[04:26:05] <Zogot> qMan2: another 1 http://tympanus.net/Development/ParallaxContentSlider/index2.html
[04:26:33] <qMan2> The first one seams like exactly what I-m looking for.
[04:26:46] <qMan2> The source for it or so, could it be downloaded as a zip?
[04:26:52] <qMan2> so I get the comple thing.
[04:26:57] <Zogot> The first one is just a jquery plugin
[04:27:24] <Zogot> qMan2: http://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/01/03/parallax-slider/ download source button
[04:30:04] <AdvoWork> if ive got $('#view_all_products_for_group td.control').live('click', function () {  how can i remove the binding of that?
[04:30:30] <Trisox> ?die
[04:30:31] <bot-t> .die(): Remove all event handlers previously attached using .live() from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/die/
[04:30:34] <Trisox> ;)
[04:30:48] <qMan2> Zogot: Thank you, will look in to that source.
[04:31:10] <Trisox> AdvoWork: check that
[04:31:19] <Trisox> for bind it is bind and unbind
[04:32:25] <AdvoWork> Trisox, cheers
[04:32:30] <Trisox> you can also $("a").unbind('click') $("a").die('click')
[04:32:37] <Trisox> thats .. the way
[04:32:55] <Trisox> you need $("a").die('click')
[04:33:01] <Trisox> AdvoWork: np
[04:34:52] <AdvoWork> Trisox, perfect :)
[04:34:58] <Trisox> ;)
[04:35:04] <Trisox> thank you come again :P
[04:38:02] <anli_> If I have a list that I got with var foo = $(':checkbox'), can I check how many of them that are checked?
[04:38:28] <anli_> By not looping
[04:39:58] <qMan2> Zogot: You still here?
[04:40:04] <Zogot> qMan2: aye
[04:40:23] <qMan2> Nice, that example is really neat. But there is one thing I can not figure out
[04:40:27] <qMan2> how to disable the thumbnails
[04:40:54] <qMan2> Just removing the html code for them breaks the enitre thing.
[04:49:54] <crashev> how to convert <form id="form"><input type="text" name="some" /></form> to {some: value} ?
[04:50:22] <qMan2> Zogot: Did you see my problem?
[04:50:27] <qMan2> About removing the thumbnails?

[05:38:11] <Chel> hi guys, question is: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9829087/set-img-src-from-already-loaded-to-browser-src-without-querying-a-host-for-this
[05:41:17] <nFFF> Chel
[05:41:20] <nFFF> I don't understand
[05:41:30] <nFFF> you want to change the image src without loading the new image
[05:41:41] <nFFF> I dont understand the purpose
[05:41:53] <nFFF> Deiu, whats the issue?
[05:42:05] <nFFF> Is it something that you can solve with encodeURI()?
[05:42:16] <Deiu> nFFF, I'm trying to pass an URL that contains an anchor (#text)
[05:42:29] <nFFF> ?encodeURI
[05:42:29] <Deiu> I've tried with encodeURI and it doesn't work
[05:42:30] <bot-t> nFFF, #11097 ($.param should allow custom URI encoding) – jQuery Core ... - Opened 3 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11097
[05:42:43] <nFFF> Can you paste your code to jsfiddle.net

[05:43:03] <coppa> Deiu don't know if can help in yoru stuff http://jquery-css.com/automatic-ajax-navigation

[05:44:46] <mikkelb> At http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/ - can anybody tell why my the menus inside "Tjenester" and "Produkter" won't drop down?
[05:44:47] <inc0> I have div with img that is loaded dynamically and can change(ajax), and I want it to be centred at all times
[05:46:15] <mindis|wurk> anyone know a fix for iframefix blocking click events within draggable elements?
[05:46:21] <nFFF> mikkelb, check to make sure jquery is laoded before your script :>
[05:47:10] <anli_> Which event does a ckeditor cause when the user adding text to the editor?
[05:47:10] <krn0> hello
[05:47:31] <mikkelb> nFFF: im pretty sure it is though
[05:48:05] <nFFF> Ok, then throw a console.log in your script to make sure it's working
[05:48:20] <erebel55> I want to be able to read a ctrl+e keypress. should i be using jquery or pure js for this?
[05:48:35] <nFFF> erebel55, either?
[05:49:02] <erebel55> ok, thanks
[05:51:09] <KasperKRK> Hello :)   Maybe someone knows similar script? looks like this -->  http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/1336/sliderl.png
[06:01:58] <mikkelb> nFFF: what you think? just added console.log but i cant see whats wrong http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/
[06:02:48] <mikkelb> wait nevermind i think i know whats wrong after all, sorry for the mess
[06:03:12] <mikkelb> no that wasnt it.. problem still stands
[06:04:05] <mikkelb> aaah.. it was overflow hidden.. damn sorry
[06:08:43] <Chel> nFFF: the problem is, the image is already loaded to the browser cache, and if i want to place it to a modal dialog, it checks server for newer version.
[06:09:31] <stagen> How do I locate the precise relative url to this image guys?
[06:09:32] <stagen> webnative.sp3.dk/webnative/getimage?-f+maczip+-high+-id+1693919+/data/kem/BILLEDARKIV/10-14/100-103/10090-1.jpg
[06:09:44] <stagen> So I get around the shitty zip conversion.
[06:14:30] <nFFF> Chel, so you are wanting to load it from cache?
[06:15:13] <Chel> yes, i found replaceWith make sence, but it removes my original tag
[06:15:35] <nFFF> why do you care about your original tag?
[06:15:36] <Chel> i need to save original and clone to modal, but $.clone() also checks the server
[06:16:07] <Chel> nFFF: because im opening a modal with preview, and original must exists after close a modal dialog
[06:16:13] <erebel55> I have something like this <g> { <svg> { <rect>} }   does anyone know how i can get the rect if i have a handle on the g? this is what i have so far http://jsfiddle.net/r9fRx/5/
[06:16:41] <nFFF> Chel, so in the modal just have a new image tag? and hide old one?
[06:17:23] <nFFF> You can pre load the image using the image object
[06:17:34] <erebel55> in other words how can i get another component from a "this".  I was trying $(this #box0)
[06:19:10] <rroelofs> erebel55: $(this).find("#box0")
[06:19:39] <erebel55> rroelofs: thank you! :)
[06:20:34] <mikkelb> At http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/ - why is the below image cycler blocking the above dropdown menu?
[06:22:27] <nFFF> Chel, like this
[06:22:27] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/KFk8q/
[06:26:22] <mekwall> nFFF, Chel: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/KFk8q/1/
[06:34:16] <nFFF> ?
[06:36:42] <krn0> how do i implement this : http://benthebodyguard.com/index.php
[06:37:21] <stagen> By not asking in here.
[06:38:01] <xec> krn0: you could start with looking at scrollTop
[06:38:17] <stagen> then learn some css.
[06:39:50] <timing> I would say, start with html
[06:39:56] <timing> or mspaint
[06:41:43] <krn0> i know some of html n css
[06:41:59] <krn0> new to jquery n jparallax
[06:42:12] <KasperKRK> Or maybe now somebody knows similar script looks like this? : -> http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/1336/sliderl.png
[06:42:15] <stagen> Might as well give up in advance then.
[06:42:39] <stagen> Does no one write their own effing jQuery anymore?
[06:44:11] <KasperKRK> stagen, If something exist, why write it twice ?
[06:44:13] <noregret> http://pastie.org/3654432 here $(this) is the form
[06:45:16] <stagen> KasperKRK: because by writing it yourself you get it exactly as you want it?
[06:46:12] <Rushing> ?scrollorama @ krn0
[06:46:13] <bot-t> Rushing, Couldn't find "scrollorama" in jQuery Docs.
[06:46:46] <Rushing> krn0: http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrollorama/
[06:48:21] <krn0> wow thanks Rushing n xec that's some heads up
[06:48:32] <KasperKRK> stagen, Yes, if you write it for yourself ;)
[06:50:11] <KasperKRK> if you write it for stupid customer, probably you want end it fast as possible
[06:52:49] <mikkelb> What's the simplest jQuery Contact Form code out there?
[06:52:52] <sggg> hi, a newbie here. just wondering can jquery read and modify a file in file system without php etc.? if it can, how to do it? any plugins? thanks a lot.
[06:53:00] <mikkelb> I need one for http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/
[06:56:03] <BaruchHashem> how do i change multiple CSS elemnts with jscript? .css({...})?
[06:57:07] <gehsekky> BaruchHashem: .css({'height':'100%', 'width':'100%'})
[06:57:16] <BaruchHashem> k thanks
[06:57:49] <claudio> BaruchHashem, they are "properties", not "elements"
[06:58:36] <BaruchHashem> ok thanks
[07:00:41] <noregret> http://pastie.org/3654432 here $(this) is the form
[07:01:46] <BaruchHashem> http://pastie.org/3654526  is this syntactically orrect?
[07:02:47] <claudio> BaruchHashem, almost. Put the () around the selector
[07:03:07] <claudio> $('#menu-item-182 .header .nav li a').css(...)
[07:04:47] <CW_> Hi.  Is there a function to easily encode arrays for sending in a query string?  The ajax functions 4.get and $.post do this automtaically.
[07:04:59] <BaruchHashem> thanks claudio
[07:05:27] <claudio> int64, like... JSON?
[07:05:51] <int64> well, lets say ?I have an array foo.  with values ["apple", "rose", "cherry]
[07:06:16] <int64> the query string will be like foo[]=apple&foo[]=rose&foo[]=cherry
[07:06:32] <int64> I was hoping for a utility funciton to atuomatically do the nice conversion for me
[07:06:37] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm trying to add a datepicker to my bootstrap site, but jQuery UI messes up bootstrap from what I understand. There is a bootstrap datepicker out there but it doesn't work in any version of IE. Any suggestions for alternatives?
[07:06:45] <claudio> int64, jquery have $.serialize
[07:06:49] <claudio> *has
[07:07:07] <int64> yeah I thought that would work, but it seems to do it differently
[07:07:13] <int64> maybe I need to have naother look though
[07:07:15] <int64> thanks
[07:07:37] <claudio> int64, OK, then "No"... :)
[07:08:00] <claudio> int64, what you are doing is more PHP related, in a way
[07:08:19] <claudio> int64, that kind of serialization is mostly PHP, I suppose
[07:08:38] <int64> yeah , but I already have another function which expects the input to come in a certain way
[07:08:42] <int64> and I dont want to rewrite it
[07:08:58] <int64> so I want my front end side to present the data in the same way as the other function
[07:12:59] <noregret> any help please, http://pastie.org/3654432
[07:14:21] <claudio> noregret, div.submit not div .submit
[07:16:29] <noregret> claudio: still empty
[07:17:01] <noregret> claudio: as shown in  console.log($(this).find('div.submit')) ie
[07:17:23] <claudio> noregret, so the "this" is not what you think it is
[07:17:38] <claudio> (or it's not yet loaded)
[07:18:50] <noregret> claudio: console.log($(this)) prints [Object { url="/mon/news/aEmail", type="post", iframeSrc="about:blank", more...}] doesn't that mean that it's the form ?
[07:19:42] <angrywombat> can anyone help me with pulling the .val() on a select box? i have the select option's val set to an int but jquery is passing the string value http://pastebin.com/tM5Njsnc

[07:23:51] <angrywombat> nm, got it
[07:23:55] <noregret> claudio: this is the whole block, http://pastie.org/3654432 no iframe..
[07:26:29] <noregret> claudio: $(this).get(0) gave Object { url="/mon/news/aEmail", type="post", iframeSrc="about:blank", more...}
[07:26:44] <noregret> $(this).get(0).input was undefined

[07:36:12] <Pilate> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/FuaqQ/6/
[07:36:18] <xec> Gates: start with looping through each price, rather than grabbing the text of the first one

[07:38:02] <Gates> Pilate xec coppa: why isnt it just each()
[07:39:10] <erebel55> DarsVaeda: it's just the string that you want to put in the input text element
[07:39:13] <beasty> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/HQjhz/
[07:39:19] <DarsVaeda> my problem is that it does not recognize when the user changes the text in the text field and I grab the content afterwards

[08:22:06] <westg> I've seen it say post soemtimes though

[08:23:26] <Innocentus> hi
[08:23:59] <Innocentus> a list element is removed from a list
[08:24:18] <Innocentus> later the list element should be reintegrated into the list again - at the same position as it has been removed before
[08:24:38] <Innocentus> how can the plugin memorize the last position of the element in the list to reintegrate it?
[08:25:06] <Innocentus> a number wouldn't be sufficient I think because the list can change between removing and reintegrating the element
[08:25:11] <sphinxxx> Innocentus:  you have to store it in a variable that is in the scope of the plugin
[08:25:26] <Innocentus> sphinxxx: yes, this is a good idea - but what has to be stored?
[08:25:55] <sphinxxx> you might need to store the element right before it, then later, search for that element, and insert your saved one after
[08:26:02] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: Collecting mobile browser bugs here for posterity: https://t.co/zoWfUVvp - Please contribute quirks. â˜… http://bit.ly/GVcCxd
[08:27:40] <sphinxxx> Innocentus:  personally i would do it like this:  when you remote it, store the index of it in a variable.  Then, every time you remove or add an element, if you're doing so before the index you saved, you can +1 or -1 to the variable.
[08:27:47] <pmcgovern> brainfart - does .val() work with select dropdowns as well?
[08:27:49] <sphinxxx> then you can just reinsert your element at the index of your variable
[08:27:56] <sphinxxx> remove it*, not remote it
[08:28:06] <chuwiey> hello all, I have a weird issue with hover(). I have a big amount of <li> where inside I have an img where on mouseenter i show() a <span> and on mouseout i hide it. The weird thing is, it works on some of them and doesn't work on others... I have tried to check which ones don't work and which ones do, but i see no difference between them. what i can say is that there is consistency (meaning, that the same items do this over and over 
[08:28:16] <ThemNuts> how do i set the "checked" attribute of a radiobutton with its name and value?
[08:28:44] <Innocentus> sphinxxx: so the plugin has to track all changes on the list, right? otherwise the stored number would become invalid
[08:29:12] <johnkpaul> ThemNuts: $("input[name="+name+"]").attr("checked","checked")
[08:29:20] <sphinxxx> Innocentus:  i don't know what the plugin is, but you can change the plugin to do it
[08:29:39] <Innocentus> sphinxxx: what about replacing the removed li with a hidden place holder li to which the plugin is referencing for to for the original li
[08:29:46] <ThemNuts> need the value aswel johnkpaul
[08:29:51] <Innocentus> *to for the original li
[08:30:00] <ThemNuts> tried different sollutions but no go
[08:30:05] <Innocentus> sphinxxx: what about performance?
[08:30:25] <johnkpaul> ThemNuts: $("input[name="+name+"]").filter(function(el){return $(el).val() === value;})attr("checked","checked")
[08:30:29] <sphinxxx> Innocentus:  that will work too.  i'd have to see a jsfiddle to get more in depth though
[08:30:51] <ThemNuts> wow
[08:30:59] <ThemNuts> why the filter?
[08:31:04] <ribot> why isn't $.post allowed in cross-domains when normal post forms are? is there a way to post with ajax just using normal form post?
[08:31:10] <ThemNuts> thought something like $(':radio[name=my_radio]').val('my_value'); but didn't work
[08:31:24] <sphinxxx> ribot: thats just how it is
[08:31:40] <johnkpaul> ribot: google for the same origin policy
[08:31:48] <sphinxxx> ribot: if the server supports cross domain requests, yeah, otherwise, no, unless you want to try jsonp
[08:31:57] <johnkpaul> ThemNuts: bcecause you want to get the specific radio button with that value
[08:32:17] <ribot> sphinxxx: i have a working solution but only ie throws an error because of it being a cross domain
[08:32:29] <johnkpaul> or actually, ThemNuts try $(":radio[value="+value+"]")
[08:33:21] <ThemNuts> yours gives me: e.nodeName is undefined
[08:33:26] <ThemNuts> k
[08:35:09] <ThemNuts> nah, no go
[08:35:45] <johnkpaul> ThemNuts: the filter did that?
[08:35:52] <Onyx47> Hello, got a werid one here. I have a menu added using a template. I have a live('click') event bound to some links in that menu. The event fires and works properly. However, while I can select any element in that menu I can't modify them. For example: $('#fm-view-menu > li > a > i') selects the element properly but if I try to do removeClass() on it nothing happens. Any ideas?
[08:36:04] <ThemNuts> premume it does
[08:36:15] <ThemNuts> although i got no idea where this e.nodeName comes from
[08:36:41] <johnkpaul> ThemNuts: if you really wan tto know, use the unminified version of jQuery
[08:36:47] <johnkpaul> and then you'll get a more useful line number and error

[08:40:46] <andrew9183> oh boy, our developers have written 3000 lines of jquery and it works tremendously slow in IE7..
[08:40:48] <itatitat> I've a problem
[08:40:53] <andrew9183> our tech lead is not pleased
[08:41:11] <itatitat> how can I know what links I've clicked (I've about 5 links)
[08:41:15] <itatitat> ?
[08:41:23] <Onyx47> johnkpaul, the whole thing is rather large so I just pasted the relevant parts. Everything except the line with removeClass works: http://jsfiddle.net/pRyAw/
[08:41:25] <itatitat> I used the property name for the links
[08:41:36] <magcius> Huh, I'm seeing an issue where my $(document).ready callback isn't being fired
[08:41:38] <itatitat> but........I feel I need something more in my logic
[08:41:46] <itatitat> part
[08:41:48] <johnkpaul> pmcgovern: I'm fairly sure that & is not a valid url part
[08:41:57] <ThemNuts> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/s4e9u/
[08:42:00] <magcius> $.isReady is true, but the readyList deferred is never getting called
[08:42:01] <johnkpaul> try passing that all to encodeURIComponent
[08:42:02] <chuwiey> what reasons should i look for where on some of my elements detect mouseenter/mouseleave and some don't? elements are the same
[08:42:23] <johnkpaul> wait no, that was dumb pmcgovern, of course it is
[08:42:26] <johnkpaul> what is teh value of the select
[08:42:42] <pmcgovern> 'relevance'
[08:42:45] <johnkpaul> Onyx47: can you make it run?
[08:42:46] <itatitat> ey
[08:42:48] <pmcgovern> without the quotes
[08:42:49] <ajpiano> andrew9183: so is the plan to use the heat energy from his anger to supercharge IE7 and make it run faster?
[08:43:25] <johnkpaul> Onyx47: a working example would be good, at face value that selector _should_ work, but it's just really complicated
[08:43:57] <magcius> OK, WTF?
[08:43:59] <Onyx47> johnkpaul, that's yhe weird part, the SELECTOR works, it's just that no method applied to it will

[08:44:54] <johnkpaul> pmcgovern: can you try just replacing that with winodw.location="http://www.google.com"
[08:44:58] <Onyx47> johnkpaul,  I console.log-ed the thing, it selects it, I get no errors thrown, nothing, just silently fails
[08:45:14] <pmcgovern> johnkpaul: I'll give it a shot and report back
[08:45:23] <johnkpaul> Onyx47: so add a breakpoint there
[08:45:35] <ajpiano> Onyx47: you can only call .ready() on $(document)
[08:45:56] <ajpiano> uhoh, i may have just munged two people's problems into one
[08:45:57] <magcius> ajpiano, did you mean to highlight me?
[08:46:12] <Onyx47> ajpiano, does seem that way, yes ^^
[08:46:20] <magcius> Look more closely -- $.fn.ready is not the same as $.ready

[08:46:45] <ajpiano> magcius: can you paste your own code somewhere?
[08:47:04] <magcius> ajpiano, it's complicated

[08:47:17] <ajpiano> magcius: the fact is that document ready works
[08:47:23] <magcius> ajpiano, but how?
[08:47:24] <ajpiano> so you are very likely doing/using something wrong
[08:47:29] <magcius> ajpiano, https://github.com/magcius/sweettooth/blob/master/sweettooth/static/js/dbus.js
[08:47:39] <magcius> ajpiano, the $(document).ready(function() {}) callback never gets called.
[08:48:26] <johnkpaul> pmcgovern: can you try putting that into the console
[08:48:58] <johnkpaul> pmcgovern:
[08:48:58] <johnkpaul> oh
[08:49:01] <johnkpaul> I just looked
[08:49:03] <johnkpaul> you have a syntax error
[08:49:11] <johnkpaul> you're missing the keyword function
[08:49:11] <ajpiano> magcius: why even bother wrapping that in a doc ready there
[08:49:26] <magcius> ajpiano, because I need to ensure that the doc is ready

[08:51:13] <johnkpaul> it shouldn't be the e.nodeName doesn't exist

[09:06:26] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[09:06:38] <johnkpaul> nFFF: closest is for children
[09:06:41] <Onyx47> johnkpaul, Opera's Dragonfly, but they all work the same basically, shouldn't make a difference
[09:07:03] <Onyx47> and yes, tested in other browsers, no dice
[09:07:14] <johnkpaul> so on that object, is there a removeClass peroperty?
[09:07:15] <johnkpaul> property*
[09:07:20] <johnkpaul> ?prevUntil
[09:07:21] <bot-t> .prevUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all preceding siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/prevUntil/
[09:07:59] <johnkpaul> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/9Es2w/1/
[09:08:18] <ThemNuts> yeah its the jquery ui buttons that are causing the problem now. Works great without them
[09:08:19] <nFFF> wierd prev() was the first thing I tried
[09:08:28] <nFFF> Perhaps i missed something
[09:08:29] <nFFF> thanks
[09:08:54] <johnkpaul> nFFF: no problem
[09:09:52] <nFFF> Ah its becuase prev is for immediate preceding sibling
[09:09:59] <nFFF> The markup is actualy different, let me change it
[09:10:11] <nFFF> I simplified it too much :D
[09:10:48] <ThemNuts> lol got the problem: they are selected but i haven't added the 'active' state to the button itself yet, making it not appear checked
[09:11:30] <johnkpaul> ThemNuts: :) that's the complication with the UI frameworks, you have to know what else they're doing to make it look correct
[09:11:48] <johnkpaul> there might be a way to trigger the "checked" event or something
[09:12:46] <nFFF> nvmd, Ill just do parent().prev(), I presumed there might be a method to go up the DOM tree
[09:14:22] <johnkpaul> nFFF: you could make something that recursively checks prev fairly easily
[09:14:32] <johnkpaul> oh, but if it's .parent().prev then no
[09:14:51] <johnkpaul> or at least, there's no obvious understanding of what that is
[09:14:53] <johnkpaul> .aunt()?
[09:14:56] <johnkpaul> .uncle()?
[09:15:35] <jahrichie> need a image gallery that does something like this http://mindsmack.tv/team/ -- any recommendations on stuff that's already somewhat built?
[09:16:29] <Paul_Linney> nFFF: johnkpaul : Try http://jqapi.com/#p=closest
[09:16:48] <anli_> Is it possible to resize a ff window?
[09:16:53] <anli_> (By using script)
[09:18:48] <nFFF> Wait
[09:18:53] <nFFF> Closest is for children?
[09:19:11] <nFFF> I need a break, I cant even think straight right now :D
[09:19:11] <ajpiano> no
[09:19:45] <nFFF> <johnkpaul> nFFF: closest is for children
[09:20:50] <Paul_Linney> nFFF: "the .closest() method searches through these elements and their ancestors"
[09:21:18] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: ^^
[09:21:29] <ajpiano> ps hi johnkpaul :D
[09:21:37] <nFFF> Yea thats what I thought,
[09:21:40] <johnkpaul> :) hey ajpiano
[09:21:51] <nFFF> bene a long day need a break I think this problems are too simple to be fumbling on
[09:22:26] <Onyx47> johnkpaul, ok, this is weird, apparently the removeClass method actually works, according to debugger at least, it seems the browser is not rendering the change though
[09:22:48] <johnkpaul> sorry, will be back
[09:26:56] <erebel55> this is getting so fugly, there has to be a nicer way to do these selection boxes http://jsfiddle.net/r9fRx/12/
[09:34:57] <Innocentus> OK
[09:34:57] <Innocentus> following problem
[09:34:57] <Innocentus> http://pastebin.de/24501
[09:34:57] <Innocentus> it is an ul list where a list item is removed and reintegrated later
[09:35:16] <Innocentus> it should be reintegrated at the same position in the list before it had been removed
[09:35:33] <Innocentus> but using index-based memory for this leads to wrong position after reintegration of list item
[09:35:38] <Innocentus> what do you think
[09:37:52] <martisj> if i have multiple callback functions inside of a $('').submit(function(){// multiple functions with callbacks in here }); what does "this" refer to when inside of the nested callbacks?
[09:39:13] <Innocentus> anyone? :(
[09:39:23] <Innocentus> I even made a nice ascii image for you
[09:41:33] <johnkpaul> martisj: that depends on what those "funtions with callbacks" are
[09:41:52] <johnkpaul> Onyx47: so is it a CSS issue? is the class removed from the dom in the dom inspector?
[09:41:59] <martisj> they are facebook js sdk FB.getloginstatus functions
[09:42:07] <martisj> also is this valid 		var this_form = this;
[09:42:33] <johnkpaul> martisj: yes, that's valid js, you can use that inside your nested callbacks
[09:43:07] <martisj> okay so i could call this_form.submit();
[09:43:07] <johnkpaul> so nFFF and ajpiano, I don't understand the .closest() discussion. how can .closest be used to get .parent().prev()?
[09:43:24] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: Only a few remaining issues to nail down before we can begin final testing for jQuery Mobile rc2. Stay tuned for updates. â˜… http://bit.ly/GVwXTf
[09:43:37] <johnkpaul> martisj: you should try it, but yes, you can
[09:43:41] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: it can't
[09:43:54] <ajpiano> it's just that closest isn't for finding children
[09:43:54] <johnkpaul> ah ok, that's what I thought
[09:44:00] <johnkpaul> ah, got it
[09:44:17] <johnkpaul> I didn't think that's whta it was trying to be used for
[09:44:47] <DarsVaeda> can I bind change with live? or get a workaround? I need it for selection lists
[09:45:07] <martisj> johnkpaul: yeah. Thing is though I did try it but the form doesn't get submitted. there might be too much of a delay, because the login box is a popup and if it is confirmed the dialog closes and the it should call this_form.submit();
[09:45:16] <martisj> but it doesn't happen like that..
[09:45:17] <martisj> hmm
[09:45:18] <Onyx47> johnkpaul, on further inspection I think something is actually reloading the template.
[09:45:36] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @martisj
[09:45:37] <bot-t> martisj, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[09:46:14] <martisj> johnkpaul: yepp hang ten :)
[09:47:07] <martisj> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/PeqzY/
[09:47:12] <johnkpaul> DarsVaeda: I don't think that change bubbles
[09:47:16] <martisj> don't know if that shows you enough.
[09:47:26] <johnkpaul> so I don't think that you can use live
[09:47:38] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: change is artificially bubbled by jquery
[09:47:42] <DarsVaeda> I thought I use click but on the option element itself
[09:47:46] <ajpiano> in 1.4 and above
[09:47:54] <ajpiano> so you can use delegate/on/live etc with it
[09:48:01] <johnkpaul> oh, cool, didn't know that
[09:48:22] <DarsVaeda> ajpiano: can you give a short example?
[09:48:55] <martisj> man it's flippin cold in melbourne now >>>>>>> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.
[09:48:55] <ajpiano> um
[09:49:08] <ajpiano> $(document).on("change", "input", function() {})
[09:49:56] <johnkpaul> martisj: which conditional is actaully being followed?
[09:50:50] <martisj> johnkpaul: if the user is logged in and has authorized the app, the first one is followed, if not a login dialog is shown and if the user agrees, the second one is followed if not alert is shown.
[09:50:52] <Onyx47> meh, I need a break, I'll try to fix this thing later
[09:51:07] <martisj> so when i have already authorised the app all is good.
[09:51:21] <johnkpaul> martisj: and when you try to use this code, this_form.submit() is never called?
[09:51:24] <johnkpaul> and there is also no alert?
[09:51:37] <martisj> let me see if there is an alert
[09:52:01] <martisj> alert works
[09:52:04] <DarsVaeda> ajpiano: ahh...don't have jquery 1.7
[09:52:11] <DarsVaeda> so no .on()
[09:52:16] <ajpiano> DarsVaeda: $("#foo").live("change", fn)
[09:52:25] <ajpiano> you don't need "an example" you need to see ?tias
[09:52:25] <bot-t> Try It And See
[09:52:29] <LordThumper> Would script in a display:none; div still be executed?
[09:52:40] <LordThumper> Sorry I meant display:none; iframe
[09:52:47] <martisj> johnkpaul: no submit() though. Actually i can't really tell you that for sure, because the form point back to the current page.
[09:52:58] <martisj> so it's a bit of a pickle i guess??!
[09:53:15] <johnkpaul> martisj: console.log?
[09:53:17] <DarsVaeda> ajpiano: that's what I tried and did not work, it is also not documented
[09:53:23] <johnkpaul> and persistent console
[09:53:38] <ajpiano> DarsVaeda: what do you mean "not document"
[09:53:38] <johnkpaul> martisj: my bet is that the form is being submitted, and something else is wrong
[09:53:39] <ThemNuts> johnkpaul: do i go the same way about it then? I need to add "ui-state-active ui-state-focus" to the class of the label with attr for of var
[09:53:44] <johnkpaul> the code you showed me looks fine
[09:53:55] <ThemNuts> i mean with the filter
[09:54:04] <johnkpaul> ThemNuts: you can use .attr("checked","checked").addClass("ui-whateer")
[09:54:10] <DarsVaeda> ajpiano: the docu says it works only on click, dblclick and so on, but not on "change"
[09:54:25] <ThemNuts> the thing is it already has values in the class and i need to add some
[09:54:35] <ThemNuts> and its not in the same input but in the label for the input
[09:54:37] <ajpiano> DarsVaeda: that's for jquery 1.3
[09:54:43] <ajpiano> DarsVaeda: i agreed the docs are a touch vauge though
[09:55:01] <ajpiano> because it doesn't explcitly say that there a bunch of events that we artificially bubble
[09:55:14] <ajpiano> change/submit/focus/blur, specfifically
[09:55:50] <ajpiano> the fact that we bubble those events is mentioned in the docs for on, however
[09:55:51] <ThemNuts> nvm got it :)
[09:55:54] <ThemNuts> thanks man
[09:55:57] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[09:56:14] <DarsVaeda> it only says that it works on events that bubble, but does not state which bubble, but I do not know what bubble means anyhow ;)
[09:56:26] <ajpiano> DarsVaeda: understanding that would probably be useful
[09:56:29] <johnkpaul> DarsVaeda: it's worthwhile to learn
[09:56:35] <DarsVaeda> okay then I guess I have another problem in my code
[09:56:37] <ajpiano> i need to go butter this toast
[09:57:02] <johnkpaul> DarsVaeda: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[09:57:09] <johnkpaul> haha, have fun ajpiano
[09:57:30] <DarsVaeda> oh that is bubbeling
[09:57:38] <DarsVaeda> I see, thanks
[09:58:29] <JazIsAtWork> Is there a list of incompatibilities between jquery and IE listed anywhere? I'm running into some ajax problems that only have an effect on IE.
[09:58:46] <EdwardIII> hey, working on something here: https://gist.github.com/2172767
[09:58:58] <EdwardIII> how come that obj.click actually seems to be clicking all the buttons?
[10:00:41] <mikkelb> Hey!
[10:00:42] <EdwardIII> jsfiddle example here: http://jsfiddle.net/paWVx/
[10:00:44] <EdwardIII> click isn't alerting
[10:01:28] <johnkpaul> JazIsAtWork: jquery supports ie6+, so there really shouldn't be any issues with the normal API, buf if you can work it down to a test case, you should submit it
[10:02:16] <mikkelb> Can somebody recommend a supersimple jQuery non-PHP contact form for http://home.no/reddvinylene/test ?
[10:03:07] <mikkelb> All the tutorials I've seen either require PHP or has some real nasty code :/
[10:03:30] <JazIsAtWork> johnkpaul: will do if i can narrow it down enough.
[10:03:44] <Larholm> mikkelb, how would the form send you an email without something on the server?
[10:04:37] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: you're class has a .
[10:05:05] <johnkpaul> and the dom element has no function called click
[10:05:07] <johnkpaul> you need a jquery obj
[10:05:14] <johnkpaul> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/paWVx/1/
[10:05:53] <mikkelb> Larholm: Good question
[10:06:35] <mikkelb> so I gotta use PHP? its my only option (without resorting to a framework or whatever)?
[10:07:05] <Emn1ty> mikkelb: for?
[10:07:20] <EdwardIII> hrm, thanks johnkpaul! i was confused because i wasn't getting a 'method not found' error
[10:07:43] <mikkelb> Emn1ty: for the contact form for http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/
[10:08:05] <Emn1ty> mikkelb: to send the email?
[10:08:27] <Emn1ty> or to validate it?
[10:08:34] <mikkelb> to send email
[10:08:46] <mikkelb> i dont wanna do no validation at this point if thats ok
[10:09:37] <Emn1ty> yeah, you need to use a server side language to process the form and send the email
[10:09:46] <Emn1ty> php, for example
[10:09:53] <martisj> johnkpaul: thanks for the tip on console.log
[10:09:57] <mikkelb> ah ok
[10:09:59] <mikkelb> php it is then
[10:10:04] <johnkpaul> martisj: no problem
[10:10:05] <mikkelb> Emn1ty: can you recommend a nice tutorial?
[10:10:07] <martisj> not rocket science but it helped me :D
[10:10:19] <johnkpaul> :) it's very useful, next to the debugger; statement
[10:10:20] <martisj> johnkpaul: still haven't figured it out yet though.
[10:10:34] <johnkpaul> well, do you know if either of your form.submit()s are being caleld?
[10:10:55] <Emn1ty> mikkelb: https://code.google.com/a/apache-extras.org/p/phpmailer/downloads/list
[10:11:14] <Emn1ty> click on wiki for how to use it
[10:11:55] <martisj> I see that another part of the page breaks, i.e. a 404 from the jwplayer assets.
[10:11:56] <anli_> Seems that a certain xml file cannot be cleaned from ie:s cache
[10:12:00] <martisj> kind of weird to be honset
[10:12:02] <martisj> honest
[10:12:14] <anli_> It doesnt matter how I reload the browser, a certain flash movie will still use the same xml file
[10:12:23] <anli_> Which is not present any longer on the webserver
[10:14:06] <soapyillusions> $('#elem').data('test') cohereces the type of the attr from string to int, I would like it to not do that, is this possible?
[10:17:23] <Aquilas> Hey guys quick question. I have this example in javascript ***jQuery.get( test.php, { 'choices[]': ["Jon", "Susan"]});*** How do I retrieve the choices array value in the test.php file?
[10:20:41] <martisj> johnkpaul: that 404 didn't have anything to do with it
[10:20:46] <KasperKRK> I've got .mouseover function, but I want execute .mouseover function every 100 milliseconds, when cursor is on div. How I can do that?
[10:21:43] <Jon47> KasperKRK: setInterval?
[10:21:46] <martisj> johnkpaul: and yeah it seems like the form gets submitted. It works following the first condition (does not show dialog) but does not work if the dialog is shown.
[10:22:26] <johnkpaul> martisj: so it does not work meaning that the callback never fires?
[10:22:49] <martisj> johnkpaul: following the second condition the page reloads and nothing happens, i.e. different from following the first condition.
[10:23:05] <martisj> johnkpaul: sorry no the callback fires but the page only refreshes.
[10:23:19] <johnkpaul> and what is the intended outcome?
[10:24:43] <rabbi1> i am using jquery.collapser.js ---- i am using the hide/show effect from collapser  plugin on a checkbox, its working good, but unable the check or uncheck the checkbox ....... how to achieve this ?
[10:25:20] <martisj> that the db is checked for whether the user id is in there, if not +1 to counter and display "thanks for vote" message else display "You have already voted".
[10:25:58] <martisj> The you have already voted is shown following the first condition, but not on the second which is the intended outcome.
[10:26:44] <martisj> could it be that the facebook login dialog automatically refreshes the page breaking all current $_post vars?
[10:30:33] <feyd> is there a way to convert a selector to a string? like $('#thing1') to 'thing1'?
[10:31:19] <erichynds> feyd: $("#thing1").selector
[10:31:47] <KasperKRK> Jon47, Yap, but if I put setinterval this function never stop.
[10:31:47] <KasperKRK> http://jsfiddle.net/9swFL/
[10:31:55] <feyd> erichynds: you are the king/queen, that's exactly what I  needed. Thanks
[10:31:59] <martisj> johnkpaul: you've given me some good ideas, any other suggestions?
[10:32:42] <johnkpaul> martisj: sorry, not always paying attention to irc
[10:32:49] <johnkpaul> my first thought is taht when the page is refreshed
[10:32:51] <Jon47> KasperKRK: you can store a handle to the interval created, and delete it when the mouseleave event occurs
[10:32:54] <johnkpaul> is .submit() called again
[10:33:12] <martisj> ahh. that could be it
[10:33:20] <martisj> thus the previous call would be reset
[10:33:35] <johnkpaul> yeah
[10:33:45] <martisj> johnkpaul: (totally get why you don't pay too much attention to irc, it's flippin' crazy... way too much info)
[10:33:56] <martisj> how could i check that?
[10:34:04] <johnkpaul> haha, it's not that, I just often have work work to do :)
[10:34:18] <johnkpaul> hm, put a breakpoint at the firs line of the .submit() handler
[10:34:20] <johnkpaul> and see if it's called
[10:41:57] <martisj> johnkpaul: see if get's called twice right?
[10:41:59] <ericbarnes> Is there anyway to mock a keypress for qunit testing?
[10:42:05] <johnkpaul> martisj: yeah
[10:42:06] <smallcapsdude> ahoy
[10:43:10] <smallcapsdude> Question for jQueryUI folks: How do I detect onchange() in an already created Calendar. (I am not allowed to modify the widget constructor).
[10:43:49] <monk12> hey all, i am using the 'masked input' plugin, and want to apply it on a dynamic ajax created input... i want to use the new 'on' syntax vs  'live' syntax. I saw this done before by doing something like this for a datepicker: http://pastebin.com/tntt95dv , not sure how to apply for 'masked input'
[10:44:58] <smallcapsdude> I'm thinking about monkeypatching something, I have a reference to the widget object: https://gist.github.com/2173116
[10:45:02] <monk12> dont want to use another plugin like 'livequery'. just 'on' method. i looked in firebug, and not sure how to see what that element has... in Firebug html tab view, i see a 'rawMaskFn', but not sure how to check for that.
[10:45:17] <smallcapsdude> ajpiano: howdy
[10:45:47] <ajpiano> hi
[10:45:49] <ajpiano> uch
[10:45:49] <ajpiano> datepicker
[10:46:02] <smallcapsdude> yeah, datepicker
[10:46:25] <smallcapsdude> Problem is that it's created in a wrapper, by a Java Component
[10:46:41] <smallcapsdude> I cant attach any callbacks to it except onselect
[10:46:59] <smallcapsdude> which apparently triggers before new date is written to dom :/
[10:47:06] <GhostCat> Hi, does anyone have any drupal experience?
[10:47:14] <ajpiano> you can add callbacks any time you want, smallcapsdude
[10:47:22] <ajpiano> wait, what
[10:47:29] <ajpiano> why don't you just attach a change event to the input element?
[10:47:35] <gdoteof> i am getting a syntax error : unexpected token ')' on line 6 of this
[10:47:39] <gdoteof> http://pastie.org/3655750
[10:47:43] <gdoteof> idgi
[10:47:53] <bonks> Is there a simple way with jquery to drag and drop a text file and capture it's contents?
[10:48:11] <ajpiano> gdoteof: wth is .click.post
[10:48:27] <smallcapsdude> ajpiano: because it will never trigger if value= attribute is modified by JS: http://jsfiddle.net/bKgUw/
[10:48:37] <ajpiano> smallcapsdude: yea, i realised that right after i said tht
[10:50:14] <gdoteof> ajpiano: um.  i thought i was saying if something with the selector h2/h3 (those should be #h2,#h3 actually) is clicked on then do the post
[10:50:23] <Edler> Where can i find copywriters on irc ?
[10:50:29] <ajpiano> gdoteof: you've like, written jquery before, right?
[10:50:33] <martisj> johnkpaul: i haven't finished debugging it yet, but say it does get submit twice how do i prevent it from doing so?
[10:50:51] <ajpiano> gdoteof: $("foo").click(function() { $.post("whatever", {});  })
[10:50:56] <smallcapsdude> ajpiano: i considered doing setTimeout within onselect() to wait for input[value] to be updated, but no go
[10:51:01] <Zzaichik> gdoteof: That is some wild and crazy code. You can't do what you're attempting in that manner buddy.  .code(function() {  $.post() });
[10:51:06] <gdoteof> ajpiano: a little.
[10:51:06] <Zzaichik> ahh ajpiano beat me to it
[10:51:07] <gdoteof> i see
[10:51:16] <gdoteof> i thought i could string them together magically
[10:51:19] <ajpiano> smallcapsdude: i was gonna suggest something hacky along those lines
[10:51:23] <Zzaichik> .codeâ€¦   = .click()
[10:51:33] <smallcapsdude> ajpiano: oh noes
[10:51:35] <gdoteof> k, tyvm
[10:51:55] <monk12> think i got it: $('#QI18').data('rawMaskFn') stored in data
[10:53:40] <martisj> johnkpaul: so the form is being submitted once
[10:54:00] <martisj> johnkpaul: once following the second condition.
[10:55:00] <martisj> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/VAFHQ/
[10:56:29] <johnkpaul> martisj: so once the page refreshes, who clicks submti again?
[10:56:35] <improwizacja> someone uses aptana 3?
[10:56:48] <martisj> johnkpaul: no one.
[10:56:54] <martisj> really weird
[10:56:58] <johnkpaul> then how can it get to the second case?
[10:57:01] <johnkpaul> .submit() isn't called again
[10:57:16] <gdoteof> well now that i fixed that noobery i am still getting essentially the same error, just a line lower http://pastie.org/3655794
[10:57:22] <improwizacja> johnpaul do you use aptana 3/
[10:58:53] <improwizacja> Someone pls someone use aptana3?
[10:59:10] <johnkpaul> haha improwizacja, perhaps try #aptana?
[10:59:31] <improwizacja> ther is not aptana room
[10:59:50] <improwizacja> what do you use for jquery?
[11:00:33] <improwizacja> there is no hope?
[11:01:18] <improwizacja> johnkpaul what do you use for jquery?
[11:01:32] <johnkpaul> vim
[11:01:41] <improwizacja> vim is free?
[11:01:59] <martisj> johnkpaul: i like your style
[11:02:13] <gdoteof> improwizacja: vim costs only time
[11:02:18] <martisj> johnkpaul: tried sublime text 2 with vintage mode ?
[11:02:44] <Zzaichik> vim is awesome, aptana seems pretty decent, I use Textmate most though
[11:02:56] <johnkpaul> martisj: no, I haven't
[11:03:05] <johnkpaul> it took me a while to learn vim, but now I am very comfortable with it
[11:03:20] <martisj> johnkpaul: i think it's pretty powerful and it has some of the power of vim.
[11:03:27] <gdoteof> vim too me a while too but now i have made everything else in my life act more like vim
[11:03:33] <martisj> johnkpaul: anyway i was wrong before, the form isn't getting submitted at all.
[11:03:39] <martisj> johnkpaul: i pooped in my pants.
[11:04:42] <martisj> johnkpaul: so now i know it's not getting submitted, any way to make sure it does after returning from the popup dialog?
[11:06:25] <improwizacja> marstisj what do you use for jquery?
[11:07:42] <martisj> johnkpaul: again i was wrong it does get to the second condition. and submits. but it doesn't show a message. is it server side then?
[11:07:47] <martisj> improwizacja: sublime text 2
[11:07:59] <martisj> and the jquery docs
[11:08:01] <martisj> a lot
[11:09:22] <tw2113> mmm sublime text
[11:11:32] <improwizacja> hughfdjackson you are using aptana 3!!!
[11:12:12] <martisj> improwizacja: does it matter?
[11:12:22] <martisj> thanks for your time johnkpaul
[11:12:30] <martisj> going off to bed now
[11:12:36] <martisj> thanks y'all
[11:12:40] <martisj> nighty night
[11:17:14] <feyd> I'm using .load() to grab some data from a page, specifically the span#data element. Load will grab the element you specify and all child data, but is there a way to JUST get the child data without carrying the parent along with it?
[11:17:48] <ctk> anyone have any experience with kendoui grids?
[11:20:55] <Innocentus> hi
[11:21:11] <Innocentus> When I add a new element to another one as children, are global css rules respected then?
[11:22:44] <JeffJassky> hey, guys. I'm using jquery UI sortable() and the "scroll" option doesn't seem to work. When I get near the edge of a screen it doesn't scroll at all. I have scroll set to true, scrollSensitivity to 100 and scrollSpeed as 100. No errors coming up in firebug - just doesn't work.
[11:22:49] <ravenzz> Innocentus yes
[11:23:05] <feyd> Innocentus: of course
[11:23:14] <feyd> Innocentus: style cascade down, hence the name
[11:23:50] <JeffJassky> doesn't work in firefox or webkit.
[11:23:50] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[11:24:04] <ravenzz> :d cute bawt
[11:24:25] <JeffJassky> okay so I'll elaborate: doesn't work means that nothing happens when i try to run it. There is no output as I said. There is no error as i said. i hope that helps.
[11:25:38] <JeffJassky> it sorts just fine. everything works as expected. The problem is the lack of scrolling.
[11:26:33] <feyd> this may seem really silly, but why don't any of my jquery methods work unless they're wrapped inside the $(document).ready(function())?
[11:27:01] <JeffJassky> feyd because they're probably executing before your dom even exists.
[11:27:18] <feyd> true
[11:28:00] <feyd> well then I have an issue. I'm making a .load() request when a select element changes using the .change() handler. It works, but it only works once, all subsequent attempts fail
[11:28:15] <feyd> no errors to be found
[11:28:40] <JeffJassky> is the select itself being replaced during the .load()?
[11:30:12] <JeffJassky> caniuse: Any thoughts?
[11:30:19] <wycks> whats up the jquery ui versioning why is 1.8.6 instead of 1.8.06
[11:32:14] <ajpiano> wycks: what versioning system has people use leading 0s before single digit numbers
[11:32:19] <feyd> JeffJassky: no, the option children are changed though
[11:32:59] <JeffJassky> feyd: I don't think that should be a problem as long as the select itself isn't being replaced.. i'm not sure what the problem would be
[11:33:05] <termleech> I have a page using jquery and jquery mobile that has a bunch of links on it, i'm trying to do something when the link is clicked
[11:33:20] <wycks> ajpiano ya i need coffee brain not working
[11:33:23] <termleech> so i have links that look like this <a href="#3" class="listing-href">Test</a>
[11:34:03] <termleech> and I have attached a handler to the link $('#parent-div').delegate('.listing-href', 'click', function() { alert($(this).attr('href') });
[11:34:07] <feyd> JeffJassky: wait, I'm an idiot, sorry. The problem I'm having is changing the .text() of a span. Same thing, it works once, but never changes after the initial event
[11:34:09] <termleech> however the alert always only says #
[11:34:12] <termleech> on any mobile device
[11:34:15] <termleech> ios or android
[11:34:17] <termleech> but works fine in chrome
[11:34:24] <termleech> does anyone have any ideas?
[11:34:29] <feyd> JeffJassky: no nevermind, i'm even dumber than ever thought possible, forget everything I said
[11:38:30] <cdkdang> hi need help with jqueryui autocomplete. i have mocked up a working product order page which auto creates new rows and adds autocomplete functionality to the row
[11:38:58] <cdkdang> see http://123.243.115.50/test/orders1.html
[11:40:17] <cdkdang> but would like to add have additional information in the drop down autocomplete field as per jqueryui demo here http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[11:41:36] <cdkdang> but when i add the data renderItem function on the demo page i get unexpected identifier
[11:41:40] <Itrace> Could anybody help me figure out something? I'm trying to animate the position of two elements. I can do that, but I need to run the function continuously. How can I do that? Here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/RjGxH/
[11:42:18] <BrassMan> hey, any jQuery mobile-knowledgeable guys around? I asked in #jquerymobile but it looks dead in there
[11:42:26] <cdkdang> see http://123.243.115.50/test/orders2.html for the identifier issue
[11:44:02] <BrassMan> and/or anyone who knows a better place to look, I guess :P
[11:47:20] <feyd> any way to strip out the parent element from a .load() method? It returns '<span>text</span>' and I just want it to return 'text'
[11:48:11] <GhostCat> How could someone go about showing the current coordinates of the mouse position over an image in a tooltip next to the mouse cursor?
[11:48:47] <feyd> GhostCat: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4582625/jquery-tooltip-that-follows-mouse
[11:48:54] <GhostCat> feyd, Thanks!
[11:58:16] <feyd> any way to strip out the parent element from a .load() method? It returns '<span>text</span>' and I just want it to return 'text'
[12:00:01] <catcher> feyd, you can grab a reference to the span and use .text()
[12:00:08] <LordThumper> Hey. I have some script that I would like to run in an iframe
[12:00:29] <feyd> catcher: will that work within the .load() method?
[12:00:37] <LordThumper> The iframe src is an html page on another sub-domain. When the script is finished I would like to notify the parent page
[12:00:40] <LordThumper> Is it possible?
[12:01:20] <feyd> $('element').load("get.aspx #data", {t:'price', q:$qty, p:$prod, d:$desc}); is what I use now, but can you do .load("get.aspx #data".text(), {t:'price', q:$qty, p:$prod, d:$desc}); or something?
[12:01:23] <LordThumper> Doing top.foo = "bar" made chrome trow an exception
[12:01:35] <LordThumper> throw*
[12:01:41] <LordThumper> "Unsafe script"
[12:02:15] <catcher> feyd, the text in the span contains the url you're trying to load?
[12:02:25] <improwizacja> hi
[12:03:11] <tehfedaykin> ok, I have an each statement, I'm saving each number returned as a var, but i need each var appended to the end of a string var
[12:03:18] <feyd> catcher: that was a bad example. The text in the span holds just a string. The load request returns <span id=#data>the string I want</span>. I just need to run .unwrap() on the result, but theres not an easy way to do that. I may just end up doing a $.get() instead
[12:03:20] <johnkpaul> LordThumper: you can't do that across domains
[12:03:51] <GhostCat> Is there an element-specific pageX and pageY?  I'm trying to determine where the mouse was click on an image, but can I avoid having to calculate it from the entire page?
[12:03:53] <johnkpaul> LordThumper: http://consumer.easyxdm.net/wp/
[12:05:10] <johnkpaul> GhostCat: in jquery I don't think so, but you can get something to help from here http://webcodingeasy.com/Javascript/Get-relative-cursor-positions
[12:05:14] <LordThumper> johnkpaul: Do i need a library?
[12:05:19] <johnkpaul> LordThumper: yes
[12:10:46] <jrockjiggz> in chrome, how can I search for a specific function to find what file it resides in? when i search 'function DisplayPage()' i get not found.. as if it's limiting the scope to a single file...
[12:11:11] <feyd> catcher: ugh, I got nothing. I tried loading the whole thing into a hidden element, then working with the data after it's loaded, but I still have problems
[12:11:33] <GhostCat> johnkpaul, I'm working in drupal for this, I'm not sure how helpful it's going to be to use the entire page, since the page where the information is needed gets recorded, and differs from the position on the page where it is used because of the way the css differs
[12:13:05] <kborchers> cdkdang: remove the ; from line 50
[12:13:17] <johnkpaul> GhostCat: I didn't say to use the entire page
[12:13:52] <catcher> feyd, I'm unclear why you wouldn't be able to access the contents of the span with $(this).next().text() or something like that..
[12:13:53] <cdkdang> kborchers
[12:14:05] <cdkdang> you gave me the answer just as i fixed it :)
[12:14:12] <cdkdang> thanks heaps anyway
[12:14:16] <johnkpaul> GhostCat: that page that I snet you has an example of calculating the x and y offset from an element
[12:14:20] <feyd> catcher: because I'm working in the .load() handler, and you don't get that syntax in it
[12:14:38] <kborchers> cdkdang: you bet, sorry i just saw your question but glad you got it
[12:14:48] <cdkdang> i was beginning to lose hope. i couldn't see the problem after an hour looking and comparing the damn scripts!
[12:14:56] <hgf> hello
[12:15:14] <hgf> what file upload plugin do you recommend?
[12:15:14] <cdkdang> kborchers nah man i really appreciate that you even looked at it.
[12:15:41] <cdkdang> bye
[12:18:15] <catcher> feyd, can you give the span an ID and reference that instead?
[12:19:04] <catcher> Ah, I see you do, #data..
[12:19:36] <feyd> catcher: that's exactly what is happening. I'm loading data from another page using .load(), specifically the #data element. The jquery .load() handler will return <span id="data">string</span>, thats just what it returns. The only way to work with the data is to work with it after it's loaded, and Im having difficulty even with that
[12:31:51] <mikkelb> I'm trying to make the simplest JS+PHP contact form possible - http://jsfiddle.net/2jXPn/1/ - are there any ways I can simplify / improve this though?
[12:46:37] <tehfedaykin> can anyone give me some advice on an each function?
[12:47:40] <Zzaichik> possibly - can I see it?  (jsfiddle.com it up)

[13:07:34] <monk12> hey all, quick question. i am looking at an input and going up to its parent, and if it doesnt have a .loading_circle, i want to add it to the last span in that div...
[13:07:45] <monk12> Without the check, its: $('#'+ zip ).parents('.subquestion').find('span:last').after('<div class="loading_circle"></div>');
[13:08:00] <monk12> but i want to add a check to see if loading_circle is NOT there, then add it.
[13:08:11] <monk12> any ideas for a quick thing i can put in the one-liner?
[13:10:00] <ravenzz> ?hasClass

[13:11:52] <NoReGreT> i appended smoe text, and i want that text to last for a couple of seconds and disappear, i want something like .effect('highlight') but applying it to the text didin't work out, what could i do in this situation ?
[13:13:05] <Zzaichik> .animate()
[13:13:13] <ravenzz> highlight is a jQuery UI effect
[13:13:24] <ravenzz> so you need to include the library
[13:14:15] <NoReGreT> Zzaichik: i want it to disappear afterwards
[13:14:22] <NoReGreT> ravenzz: i'm aware of that, it's already included
[13:14:26] <tetradon> I'm getting a parseerror - syntaxError coming from a ajax error callback function. I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this issue because my script is syntactically correct. For some pages, the script runs fine and for other pages it doesn't.

[13:15:13] <Zzaichik> .delay.animate({ opacity: 0 });
[13:15:23] <Zzaichik> .delay(2000) that is
[13:15:42] <monk12> hey ravenzz... so has() also checks descendents. Easier to do a 'hasNot' type selector function but none exists. I could i almost want to use not() but with a find since not checks the current element and not the children... $('.subquestion').find('.loading_circle').not(??).after(<div ...'addStuff>')  it
[13:15:45] <tetradon> it says the error type is "unexpected_token". I'm using json objects and at the end I have a curly brace which I'm assuming would be the unexpected_token
[13:17:52] <ravenzz> monk12 you want to select any descentant which has not the .loading_circle class?
[13:19:05] <endolphin> https://gist.github.com/2174556 can someone please tell me what's wrong iwth this
[13:19:14] <endolphin> i wrote it from scratch because of laziness
[13:19:28] <endolphin> seems right, but apparently isn't (doesn't prevent default or issue any alerts)
[13:19:38] <monk12> ravenzz, so lets say <div class="parent"> is the container and it has many <spans> in it... I want to add a <div class="ajax_loading" /> after the last span, only if its not there already.
[13:19:49] <Eviltwin> ?event.preventDefault @ endolphin
[13:19:54] <bot-t> endolphin, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[13:20:04] <endolphin> yeah i know
[13:20:05] <endolphin> it's in there
[13:20:18] <Eviltwin> endolphin: Look at the page
[13:20:20] <endolphin> sans parentheses (which i deleted earlier because stupid)
[13:20:26] <endolphin> still, no alert at the beginning
[13:20:48] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ endolphin
[13:20:48] <bot-t> endolphin, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:20:49] <tetradon> however it's adding the curly brace by itself
[13:20:55] <endolphin> ugh
[13:21:01] <monk12> so lets say i had $('.parent').find('span:last').after('<div class="ajax_loading" />'); each time a character  is typed in.. but it could add many ajax-images there if user types fast, and response is slow. so i only want to add one div if its not there
[13:21:04] <tetradon> anyone ever experienced this kind of issue before?
[13:21:16] <endolphin> no way
[13:21:21] <Eviltwin> endolphin: Help us help you if you want help
[13:21:37] <endolphin> i'm just asking if anyone sees an error in that code
[13:21:37] <craZZter> Hmmm... I'm pretty new to jquery but can's seem to find an answer... I've got at selected form. I post it to a PHP page by using 'serialize' and $.post. On the PHP page I receive a string like "foo1=bar1&foo2=bar2". What is the proper way to turn it into something usable?
[13:22:01] <Eviltwin> Well you shouldn't have dropped the parens
[13:22:10] <endolphin> that's part of it
[13:22:13] <Eviltwin> No idea what inspired you to do that
[13:22:30] <endolphin> satan obviously
[13:23:02] <Eviltwin> I would try putting alert(jQuery(".formval").length) right before
[13:23:09] <endolphin> oh
[13:23:14] <Eviltwin> See if you're actually selecting anything
[13:23:16] <ravenzz> monk12 1 sec, I have to be ready, because my friend is coming to pick me up. brb
[13:23:17] <endolphin> there was an extra }) at the end of the application.js
[13:23:18] <endolphin> O_O

[13:43:20] <johnkpaul> sorush20_: how do you know it's the 'home page'?
[13:43:48] <sorush20_> johnkpaul: its a joomla page .. would you check the url?
[13:44:09] <sorush20_> johnkpaul: or the document title tag
[13:44:11] <johnkpaul> I don't know if that's really the best way to do it, but yes, you can check window.location
[13:44:14] <johnkpaul> or the title tag
[13:44:23] <johnkpaul> does joomla not have a way to add javascript to particular pageS?
[13:44:50] <sorush20_> johnkpaul: don't know but will do it manually for now.. let me know if yo find something.
[13:45:43] <NoReGreT> can someone tell me why this doesn't work out: .delay(2000).effect('blind').empty() .. the text doesn't even show up, it gets directly deleted..

[13:46:16] <sorush20_> same as $('title')
[13:47:03] <sorush20_> this is my first script by the way
[13:47:38] <Eviltwin> NoReGreT: .empty() isn't part of the queue
[13:47:39] <johnkpaul> $("title").text()
[13:48:11] <NoReGreT> Eviltwin: then how can I achieve what i want
[13:48:28] <Eviltwin> Use a callback
[13:48:40] <Eviltwin> NoReGreT: http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/
[13:48:40] <johnkpaul> so who's going to jqueryconf in san francisco
[13:48:51] <Zzaichik> :(
[13:49:06] <Eviltwin> NoReGreT: For the callback paramater you can specify a function that gets called when the effect is done
[13:49:12] <johnkpaul> I'm debating getting one of the last early bird tickets
[13:55:37] <bonks> How do I pass data containing special characters to getJSON()?
[13:57:25] <Eviltwin> bonks: The same way you pass data not containing special characters?
[13:57:31] <Eviltwin> I don't understand the issue
[13:58:57] <johnkpaul> bonks: do you mean how to urlencode it for jsonp?
[13:59:06] <johnkpaul> ?mdn encodeuricomponent

[13:59:13] <bonks> i'm calling an api and passing a base64 value
[13:59:14] <johnkpaul> whoa
[13:59:56] <sorush20_> <script>function hideslide(){if $("title").text(!Home){$('slide').hide()}else{ }}</script>
[14:00:17] <bonks> http://domain.com/api/blah/base64 <-- how can i ensure getJSON('http://domain.com/api/blah/', {value: base64}) the base64 is a valid url
[14:00:36] <johnkpaul> bonks, look into encodeURIComponent
[14:00:39] <johnkpaul> ?encodeURIComponent
[14:00:43] <bot-t> johnkpaul, param.diff on Ticket #2726 – Attachment – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - This is the change, but I think I won't be able to apply it as many people/servers don't expect this to happen. http://bugs.jquery.com/attachment/ticket/2726/param.diff
[14:00:47] <bonks> ok thanks
[14:01:40] <sorush20_> is my little script okay
[14:01:44] <sorush20_> its not working
[14:02:46] <iateadonut> i have a table that holds a few more tables (for good reason; it's displaying data, and payment data, etc).
[14:03:32] <iateadonut> in one of my <tr>'s, i am toggle()'ing a table within it, and the screen stays inline with the top of the <tr>
[14:03:48] <iateadonut> but in the <td> next to it, the screen jumps around when i toggle() the table within it.
[14:03:55] <iateadonut> i wonder what the difference could be.
[14:04:39] <bonks> "The length of the query string for this request exceeds the configured maxQueryStringLength value." -- I can fix this, but is there a proper way to send long strings in a url?
[14:04:48] <willgretz> Hello, I have a carousel that I use animate to slide, when I am done sliding the items sliding are 1/10 off what they should be
[14:07:13] <robhol> Anybody have any idea why this doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/ePNYXnMX   The load() is definitely being called, it's definitely the right URL, the Firefox console shows "OK", but it doesnt look like it's calling the callback. setText does what it's supposed to.
[14:07:20] <johnkpaul> bonks: there's a 4k limit
[14:07:21] <johnkpaul> in the url
[14:07:30] <johnkpaul> by the http standard I'm fairly sure
[14:08:05] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[14:08:08] <ProLoser|Work> i have a complex issue
[14:08:18] <ProLoser|Work> i need to remove elements, but i need to also put them back
[14:08:25] <johnkpaul> bonks: the 4k limit is in most browsers, the standard has a 414 error response code to describe that situation
[14:08:29] <johnkpaul> is this jsonp?
[14:08:44] <ProLoser|Work> like remove them from the dom
[14:08:51] <johnkpaul> and what's the purpose of this? are you really doing a lookup on a gigantic piece of search data
[14:08:56] <johnkpaul> ?detatch @ProLoser|Work
[14:08:57] <bot-t> ProLoser|Work, .detach() - Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[14:08:58] <bonks> johnkpaul: i dont think so, i'm just creating a simple rest api
[14:09:08] <ProLoser|Work> johnkpaul: how do you put them back?
[14:09:12] <bonks> johnkpaul: i'm just converting file contents via javascript
[14:09:16] <johnkpaul> bonks: so is this particular rest method actually indempotent
[14:09:22] <johnkpaul> ?append @ProLoser|Work
[14:09:23] <bot-t> ProLoser|Work, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[14:09:33] <ProLoser|Work> johnkpaul: it loses the order
[14:09:40] <ProLoser|Work> how can i retain the spot i removed it from?
[14:09:51] <johnkpaul> you have to keep track of where you removed it
[14:10:00] <johnkpaul> you need to have some hook element that it is appended/prepended to
[14:10:01] <ProLoser|Work> what if i remove multiple items?
[14:10:12] <johnkpaul> ProLoser|Work: then you need to keep track of that in your own code
[14:10:23] <ProLoser|Work> i'm trying to remove elements instead of hide/show so that :last-child and :first-child work properly
[14:10:25] <bonks> johnkpaul: so far I have an event handler when a user drag and drops a file, it is opened with a FileStream which text is Base64, and passed to the api in a long url. i can't think of another way
[14:10:32] <johnkpaul> jquery on it's own won't keep track of that for you, but it will let  you 'detach' an element to be put back later
[14:11:05] <johnkpaul> ProLoser|Work: so then just insertAfter the last child
[14:11:09] <johnkpaul> ?insertAfter
[14:11:10] <bot-t> .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[14:11:21] <johnkpaul> bonks: but why does it have to be a get?
[14:11:26] <superdmp> ProLoser|Work: are you https://github.com/ProLoser/AnythingSlider?
[14:11:28] <johnkpaul> if you're making a rest api
[14:11:35] <ProLoser|Work> superdmp: yes
[14:11:51] <superdmp> ProLoser|Work:  cool - and thanks!
[14:11:56] <superdmp> for https://github.com/ProLoser/AnythingSlider
[14:12:00] <johnkpaul> why not use post or put?
[14:12:01] <bonks> johnkpaul: i don't know what i'm doing? still learning. what is a better way?
[14:12:11] <ProLoser|Work> lol np, but it's a work of multiple contributors
[14:12:21] <MagmaRules> Hi guys, is there any libs for jquery that for widgets that allow me to easily build layouts? I stumbled across http://ukijs.org/ and i was amazed how fluid the layouts with splitters and all are =)
[14:12:24] <ProLoser|Work> mot tie works on it mostly nowadays, and chris coiyer started it
[14:12:43] <bonks> johnkpaul: can I do that with getJSON? because i want to capture the "converted" results
[14:12:54] <superdmp> i know, but it's nice to be able to thank at least someone for these things now and then
[14:13:00] <ProLoser|Work> lol
[14:13:01] <johnkpaul> no, you can do it with $.post
[14:13:03] <johnkpaul> ?post
[14:13:03] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[14:13:06] <ProLoser|Work> touche
[14:13:15] <johnkpaul> and you can still get the converted results that are passed back
[14:13:39] <ProLoser|Work> if you want i'm trying to get more twitter followers: twitter.com/artengineered lol
[14:13:39] <bonks> johnkpaul: interesting, i'll try that

[14:14:27] <raj> johnkpaul, is there a better way to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/ajyxd/28/ so lower precedence items (those <select>s above) remove any <option>s higher precedence <select>s have already used?
[14:14:41] <raj> the code on my server is VERYVERY messy
[14:14:46] <raj> and i'm certain there must be a better way to do this
[14:15:04] <raj> i have soo many nests of ifs and fors
[14:16:13] <robhol> I have no idea what's wrong here: http://pastebin.com/ePNYXnMX   The load() is definitely being called, it's definitely the right URL, the Firefox console shows "OK" (no errors), but it doesnt look like it's calling the callback. setText does what it's supposed to.
[14:17:37] <djarinjer> is there any reason *not* to use the widget factory?
[14:18:14] <supsup> robhol check your data perhaps make sure it's what u expect.
[14:18:26] <robhol> which data?
[14:18:31] <supsup> (data)
[14:18:43] <robhol> as I said, it's not being called at all
[14:18:45] <supsup> the response
[14:19:15] <supsup> i dont use $.get i use $.ajax for everything so yah not sure maybe rewrite it using .$ajax
[14:20:03] <GhostCat> I'm using Jquery.append() to add div elements to a div by click.  As I add them in the interface, the newer divs get added lower and lower, is there a way to prevent this without compensating mathematically?
[14:20:33] <robhol> supsup: hrm... will try that
[14:20:40] <supsup> then maybe u can add console to the different properties
[14:20:45] <supsup> to find out where it's breaking
[14:20:47] <carpeliam> does the new(ish) $.when offer support for handling parallel deferreds? i don't see it in the api, but i'm probably missing something
[14:20:50] <supsup> like beforeSend and stuff
[14:22:01] <supsup> also whats up with your functions having { on new lines
[14:22:11] <robhol> I prefer them on new lines :p
[14:22:12] <supsup> Crockford would not like it
[14:22:39] <supsup> u need to watch this ...sec i'll find it
[14:23:15] <supsup> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=taaEzHI9xyY
[14:23:16] <robhol> I'm not looking for a brace-position conversion, thanks, I just want to figure out why this thing isn't doing anything :p
[14:24:54] <bonks> now is there a way to format encoded html for displaying on the page? like proper identing
[14:26:24] <crutex> Ìû
[14:26:31] <sorush20_> on this page www.sorushnazari.com/tiempolatinolondres how do I hide the div slide when the I'm not on the home page and i'm on any other page?
[14:27:41] <robhol> That's odd- after adding document.writeln-s I get "attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope"
[14:27:57] <robhol> around the .get line, that is, supsup
[14:28:11] <sphinxxx> sorush20_: check against window.location.href
[14:29:16] <johnkpaul> raj: what is the issue in your code?
[14:29:18] <sphinxxx> so check that, if you're on homepage, do what you need to do
[14:30:08] <sphinxxx> GhostCat: what exactly are you trying to do?
[14:30:22] <raj> johnkpaul, if something other than the lowest precedence select is changed, it needs to adjust all lower precedence selects' options to remove the one that's now being used (and add back whichever was removed before)
[14:30:35] <supsup> not sure what you mean robhol
[14:30:53] <GhostCat> sphinxxx, Thanks for your time!  I want to click to add an image over an existing div, I need this to happen multiple times, right now I'm using display:inline-block, but I still get horizontal drift equal to the width of the image
[14:31:14] <johnkpaul> raj: that's a pretty complicated requirement, what is the particular problem you're havingwth this code
[14:31:23] <robhol> Added document.writeln calls around the $.get("fngldfjng") line to see if they'd show up - now that error shows up in the console. Both lines are written, btw
[14:31:34] <GhostCat> The images should display at an absolute position irrespective of one another, but relative to the parent element
[14:31:36] <sphinxxx> GhostCat:  can you make a jsfiddle of the problem
[14:32:02] <GhostCat> sphinxxx, um... i'm kind of working tightly integrated with drupal
[14:32:07] <GhostCat> sphinxxx, let me see what i can do
[14:32:10] <sphinxxx> images all the same size?
[14:32:14] <GhostCat> yes
[14:33:02] <sphinxxx> its hard for me to visualize the problem
[14:33:09] <sphinxxx> if you can make just a simple demo i can help maybe
[14:34:52] <robhol> Bah, after some googling it looks like that error was unrelated, apparently document.write(-ln) shouldn't be used
[14:34:56] <GhostCat> sphinxxx, I can't really do a demo of this, it's kind of woven into drupal in a bunch of places, I can explain better though!  Imagine a div 500x500, you can click anywhere and an image of a house will appear.  I need those images to appear *exactly* where clicked.  Right now every time I click, the image appears 60px to the right, cumulatively (the width of the house images).
[14:35:30] <sphinxxx> how big are the images?
[14:35:54] <sphinxxx> and you're using the click event in query for the mouse position of the click?
[14:35:55] <GhostCat> sphinxxx 60x60
[14:36:11] <GhostCat> I'm using onmousedown, hold on ill find the line
[14:36:36] <sphinxxx> set position of the image absolute,  and the div relative.  then left and top should be x and y of the mouse click, respectively
[14:36:41] <sorush20_> its too complicated for me at the moment.. I would rather someone did the code for me
[14:36:42] <sphinxxx> if its off, its an issue with merging or padding
[14:36:49] <sphinxxx> margin*
[14:36:56] <GhostCat> $('.container').mouseup()
[14:37:31] <GhostCat> is the code, and then it runs through some math to get the position and uses ('.container').append() to place the image in a div
[14:38:30] <sphinxxx> just make a jsfiddle of your js code
[14:38:32] <GhostCat> sphinxxx, I just set the images' margins to 0px, it doesn't seem to be an issue there
[14:39:04] <GhostCat> let me see what i can do
[14:40:20] <Misiur> Hi. How can I select object && prevAll elements?
[14:41:34] <Misiur> Like $(element).next().prevAll()
[14:43:17] <johnkpaul> Misiur: there's a way to add back the original selector
[14:43:23] <johnkpaul> but it's escaping my memory at the moment
[14:43:24] <dabear> Misiur: .andSelf()
[14:43:54] <Misiur> dabear: Awesome, thanks
[14:57:44] <superdmp> the lightboxes that should appear when selecting the images at http://v029.medcn.uwcm.ac.uk:8000/imagetest/ won't work in IE (I tested 6-8) - but after lots of testing, I discovered that it seems only over http
[14:57:57] <superdmp> if the files are loaded from local storage, they do work
[14:58:18] <superdmp> over http, there is some sort of JS error
[14:58:29] <superdmp> any suggestions what on earth might be happening?
[14:59:18] <initself> so, my form gives me this
[14:59:24] <initself> prod_num=CMH20T%2FU%2F830%2FG12
[14:59:27] <initself> in my url params
[14:59:33] <initself> is that called url encoding?
[14:59:51] <initself> and is there an easy jquery or javascript function that converts it back to "normal" for me?
[14:59:56] <raj> johnkpaul, the code I pasted nothing, but the code I'm actually using, a lot...it's very complicated...i thought there might be an easier way to do it, using that fiddle as a base
[15:02:32] <initself> $.URLDecode maybe

[15:03:25] <initself> dabear++ # dabears
[15:05:03] <initself> dabear: am i going crazy doing stuff like this?
[15:05:04] <initself> var hashes = window.location.href.slice(window.location.href.indexOf('?') + 1).split('&');
[15:05:13] <initself> instead of using this plugin that you referred me to?
[15:05:23] <dabear> do whatever floats your boat
[15:06:48] <supsup> superdmp its because it does not know what type of img it is...there maybe some setting u can tell fancybox that what media type it is
[15:07:52] <superdmp> supsup:  it's not linking to an image - it's linking to a fragment if HTML, for example: http://v029.medcn.uwcm.ac.uk:8000/arkestra-imageset-item/66/
[15:08:24] <superdmp> but that does work when the fragment of HTML is in a local file
[15:09:48] <supsup> your clicking on an img no?
[15:10:03] <supsup> err
[15:10:05] <supsup> an anchor tag
[15:10:08] <supsup> that refrences an image
[15:10:15] <superdmp> supsup:  no
[15:10:22] <superdmp> it doesn't reference an image
[15:10:28] <supsup> ah i see ok
[15:10:43] <superdmp> the href of the anchor is for example: http://v029.medcn.uwcm.ac.uk:8000/arkestra-imageset-item/66/
[15:11:03] <supsup> maybe u have to tell it it's not media.
[15:11:25] <superdmp> i am telling it that it's a "type": "inline"
[15:11:44] <superdmp> if the html fragment were part of the original page, it would work
[15:12:04] <superdmp> and if it were loading the fragment as a file rather than http, it would work
[15:12:13] <superdmp> and naturally, it works in all the proper browsers
[15:12:32] <superdmp> but in IE, over http, when the fragment is a separate resource - nope
[15:15:48] <superdmp> I am going to bed to curse IE in my dreams
[15:16:16] <supsup> its something to do with inline... hard to debug because u have compressed versions of that fancy box on your server
[15:16:23] <supsup> or minified
[15:20:16] <RodrigO23> Ola pessoal
[15:20:22] <RodrigO23> Hi
[15:24:08] <blazedd> Does anyone have any experience with the quicksand plugin?
[15:24:33] <RodrigO23> Quicksand
[15:34:18] <raj> any quick/easy way to have each element take the name of its .prev() element, and the .prev() element take the name of its .prev() element, and so on, until no more prev siblings?
[15:40:04] <dabear> raj: there is of course there is no such functionality. if you need to do that, then code it
[15:40:15] <thenarlynin> How do I prevent a call to .html() from scrolling to the top of the page
[15:40:19] <MercuryTW> hello all. I'm having some confusion with jQuery.get(). How do I use the object that's returned? I'm calling for json, and I want it as a string, however doing an alert(result) returns [object Object] rather than a string. what do?
[15:40:23] <dabear> using .each, attr etx
[15:40:43] <nFFF> MercuryTW, console.log(result)
[15:40:46] <raj> k, just seeing if can make my code a little more efficient
[15:40:50] <nFFF> check ur properies cuz
[15:40:54] <raj> it's sooo freaking nested
[15:40:59] <MercuryTW> nFFF. Thanks trying now.
[15:41:19] <raj> nFFF, was that like a gangsta "cuz" ?
[15:41:32] <nFFF> MercuryTW, your chrome/firefox console, will present you with a treat
[15:41:37] <nFFF> raj of course :>
[15:41:42] <raj> nice
[15:42:00] <nFFF> gotta represent
[15:42:06] <raj> word up
[15:42:25] <Whirl3d> Y'all from the south?
[15:42:35] <nFFF> even worse, the UK :<
[15:42:36] <MercuryTW> yeah... that's not what I wanted lol. It's a bunch of code it seems. is it a promise object? if so, how do I block and retrieve the contents
[15:42:38] <raj> N up S down
[15:43:21] <raj> speaking of UK gangstas http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an_STKm-524
[15:43:25] <Whirl3d> I thought "represent" was a local thing here in the ATL
[15:43:38] <raj> nah son, worldwide
[15:43:53] <nFFF> lol ushers brought it to the world
[15:44:16] <nFFF> MercuryTW, you tell me what type of object it is
[15:44:24] <nFFF> your server returns it :|
[15:44:42] <MercuryTW> it should be a text/plain json
[15:44:50] <dabear> MercuryTW: ajax is async
[15:45:04] <MercuryTW> i know. but I can't deffered.
[15:45:14] <dabear> huh
[15:45:25] <dabear> the returned object IS a deferred object
[15:45:27] <MercuryTW> right
[15:45:44] <MercuryTW> i want to block and retrieve the object "being promised"
[15:45:50] <MercuryTW> but I don't know how.
[15:46:22] <dabear> $.when($.get("fooo.html")).then( function(html) {  alert(html) }   )
[15:47:51] <MercuryTW> neat.
[15:48:16] <nFFF> looks like pseudo code , kudos if it works ha :p
[15:48:50] <dabear> read the docs dude
[15:48:52] <dabear> it works
[15:49:21] <tw2113> documentation works?
[15:49:29] <tw2113> awesome :D
[15:49:38] <nFFF> :>>
[15:49:42] <dabear> funny
[15:49:43] <dabear> not
[15:50:25] <MercuryTW> seems like it works, but I need it to block
[15:51:20] <dabear> no, you need to understand that ajax should be async
[15:51:22] <MercuryTW> bah. I could desynchronize (is that even a word?) my code
[15:51:24] <dabear> and not sync
[15:51:25] <EugenA> i'm trying to use backstretch jquery plugin, but i'm getting error: $ is undefined
[15:51:59] <MercuryTW> dabear: I will do that, but right now I'm just testing my business logic. is there a kludge in the mean time?
[15:52:04] <dabear> MercuryTW: any code depending on the result of the html should be placed in  the .then handler
[15:52:17] <EugenA> 1) jquery is loaded, then 2) backstretch is loaded
[15:52:32] <dabear> MercuryTW: yep
[15:52:42] <dabear> and that is to place code inside the handler
[15:52:54] <MercuryTW> omg science
[15:52:56] <MercuryTW> good call
[15:53:37] <dabear> if you ever think of writing a business app that's using blocking io then you have a problem
[15:53:45] <MercuryTW> no no lol
[15:54:04] <MercuryTW> "business logic" as in the part of my code that does the heavy lifting
[15:58:52] <BrassMan> how do I write a selector to include and object AND all of its parents?
[15:59:10] <nFFF> ?parentsall
[15:59:11] <bot-t> nFFF, Child Selector (“parent > child”) - Selects all direct child elements specified by "child" of elements specified by "parent". http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[15:59:12] <nFFF> maybe
[15:59:39] <nFFF> ?parents
[15:59:40] <bot-t> .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[15:59:55] <BrassMan> it's the "and" part that I'm trying to figure out
[16:00:26] <BrassMan> $(e.target).parents() gets me the parents but not the object itself
[16:01:16] <nFFF> just use
[16:01:17] <nFFF> ?add
[16:01:17] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[16:02:11] <nFFF> $(e.target).parents().add($(e.target)); ?
[16:02:18] <nFFF> theres probably a better way though
[16:02:53] <BrassMan> $(e.target).parents().add(e.target) worked just fine!
[16:02:56] <BrassMan> thanks :D
[16:03:16] <nFFF> :>
[16:03:22] <blazedd> Is there a way to animate css scale?
[16:03:29] <nFFF> It doesn't seem very elegant, but if it works I guess :<
[16:03:44] <Poetro> blazedd: what do u mean?
[16:04:13] <Poetro> blazedd: u can animate any propery, but u may have to write some custom code
[16:05:04] <johnkpaul> BrassMan: .andSelf()
[16:05:09] <johnkpaul> ?andSelf @BrassMan
[16:05:09] <bot-t> BrassMan, .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[16:05:34] <dogarrhea2> hi all
[16:05:40] <blazedd> Poetro I'm trying to animate between scale 0.0 and 1.0
[16:06:03] <dogarrhea2> when i have a display:none and do css("display","inline-block"), the browser ignores it
[16:06:08] <Poetro> if it is numeric, and accessible through .css then u should have no problem
[16:06:09] <BrassMan> works too, thanks
[16:06:17] <dogarrhea2> it will briefly display the element, the quickly go back to display:none
[16:06:18] <dogarrhea2> how do i fix it
[16:06:57] <BrassMan> while I'm at it, it would be awesome if anyone knew a fix for:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/560 ; it's jquery mobile specific, but #jquerymobile is nonresponsive
[16:06:58] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #560 on jquery-mobile (JamesNK; 1y, 3m ago): jQuery Mobile + iframe causes the parent page to jump to the iframe when a link is clicked
[16:07:19] <MercuryTW> hot damn. it works
[16:07:45] <MercuryTW> thanks nFFF and dabear. much appreciated

[16:10:29] <MercuryTW> I mean to say my code does real
[16:11:06] <Es0teric> how do i do a switch/case with inArray ?
[16:12:02] <Poetro> Es0teric: why would u do that?
[16:12:29] <Es0teric> Poetro because i want it to do something when it detects a word in the url.. then switch the styles to fit to the url
[16:12:34] <Poetro> ?inArray
[16:12:34] <bot-t> jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[16:12:36] <Es0teric> and i have different url's to actually switch to
[16:12:43] <Es0teric> Poetro i KNOW how to use inArray
[16:12:48] <Es0teric> i am saying
[16:13:08] <Poetro> why dont u just use .map?
[16:13:14] <Poetro> .each?
[16:13:16] <Es0teric> set a variable in $.inArray(var1, array1); then switch/case var1
[16:13:30] <alp> hi guys. simple question. I have a div it is $('.new') (.length is 1), I want to append it to #comments. $('#comment').append($('.new')); does not do anything, no reaction on console, any ideas why this might happen?
[16:13:54] <dogarrhea2_> so, display:none cannot be overriden in jquery
[16:13:56] <MercuryTW> I mean to say "Gracious. The esoteric mechanations known formally as 'jQuery' are functioning in such a manner as to be in accordance with the criteria of successful execution of my computer software which I designed at the outset of my development process."
[16:13:56] <dogarrhea2_> known issue?
[16:14:12] <Poetro> dogarrhea2_: what do u mean cannot be overridden?
[16:14:29] <nFFF> MercuryTW very well said.
[16:14:37] <dogarrhea2_> .css("display","inline-block")  <--------- this will briefly show the item for less than a second
[16:14:45] <dogarrhea2_> and then go back to being "display:none"
[16:14:49] <dogarrhea2_> if there is a class that is applied that reads "display:none"
[16:16:07] <Poetro> dogarrhea2_: div.css('display', '');
[16:16:21] <nFFF> dogarrhea2_ paste your code
[16:17:03] <Poetro> ?css
[16:17:03] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[16:18:36] <alp> guys why x.appendTo(y) cuts y and pastes it into x? I want to copy y to x.
[16:18:47] <Poetro> alp: then copy it
[16:18:47] <alp> sorry appendTo -> append.
[16:18:51] <Poetro> ?clone
[16:18:52] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[16:19:04] <Poetro> and then append it
[16:19:09] <Es0teric> ok so i have this -> http://notey.it/n/Njg
[16:19:41] <Poetro> Es0teric: wow... why dont u case on tevnt
[16:19:51] <Es0teric> Poetro what?
[16:19:57] <Poetro> Es0teric: u basically now SET the tevnt
[16:20:08] <Es0teric> oh snap
[16:20:09] <Es0teric> right
[16:20:27] <Es0teric> so then it would be case "job" :
[16:20:28] <Poetro> switch (tevnt) {case 'job': whatever; break; }
[16:20:29] <Es0teric> right?
[16:20:31] <Es0teric> yea
[16:20:44] <alp> Poetro: but how can I also clone binded events?
[16:20:58] <Poetro> alp: did u read the docs i linked?
[16:22:02] <Es0teric> Poetro i did that right? but now for some reason, it still reads the first case
[16:22:39] <Poetro> ?demo
[16:22:39] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:23:05] <Es0teric> -_-
[16:24:18] <Es0teric> Poetro how am i supposed to do.. location.pathname on jsfiddle?
[16:25:15] <Poetro> Es0teric: just some code example... it doesnt have to have location or anything
[16:28:55] <Es0teric> Poetro http://jsfiddle.net/ttMR6/1/
[16:29:57] <Poetro> Es0teric: but tevnt is not ever filled
[16:30:16] <Es0teric> Poetro what do you mean?
[16:30:29] <Poetro> Es0teric: u dont assign any value to it
[16:30:39] <Es0teric> exactly, the value would be assigned in the case
[16:30:50] <Poetro> Es0teric: but based on what?
[16:30:58] <Es0teric> based on what i type
[16:31:06] <Es0teric> its supposed to grab a word in the array
[16:31:11] <Es0teric> and if it matches that word
[16:31:15] <Es0teric> change said elements
[16:31:26] <Es0teric> but this array would come from the url split
[16:31:42] <Poetro> but u dont do anything with the array, just check if a value is present
[16:31:53] <Es0teric> yea
[16:32:15] <Poetro> Es0teric: i think u should work with $.each instead
[16:32:21] <Poetro> or just a for loop
[16:32:26] <Es0teric> no loops
[16:32:39] <Es0teric> you know what? i'll just do else/if
[16:32:41] <Es0teric> then remove class
[16:32:56] <Es0teric> because thats all i really want
[16:33:33] <Es0teric> wait
[16:33:36] <Es0teric> that won't make any sense
[16:35:26] <Poetro> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/Poetro/ttMR6/2/
[16:36:09] <EugenA> why i'm getting error $ is undefined if jquery is loaded??
[16:36:18] <Es0teric> ohhhhhh, Poetro i didn't think of it like that
[16:36:18] <Es0teric> lol
[16:36:31] <Poetro> EugenA: maybe jQuery is NOT loaded
[16:36:48] <Poetro> EugenA: or it is in noConflict mode
[16:36:53] <EugenA> Poetro: i've checked that, it is loaded
[16:37:05] <Poetro> EugenA: how did u check that<
[16:37:36] <EugenA> 1) networt tab of firebug 2) clicked in source code on js file
[16:37:38] <tw2113> are you loading jquery before your script that you're trying to use?
[16:37:40] <daverau> Conceptually, how would I go about adding day-by-day saving & pagination to this page? http://daverau.info/happy/
[16:38:10] <EugenA> tw2113: jquery is loaded before all scripts
[16:38:12] <Poetro> EugenA: did u add your script to load after jQuery
[16:38:21] <EugenA> Poetro: sure
[16:38:36] <Poetro> EugenA: and did u check that nothing has made jQuery to be in noConflict?
[16:38:41] <Poetro> ?noConflict
[16:38:41] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[16:39:03] <EugenA> i know nothing about "noConflict"..
[16:39:24] <Poetro> EugenA: it resets back the $'s value to what it was before jQuery was loaded
[16:39:33] <tw2113> a dumb luck answer...instead of $() just try jQuery()
[16:39:40] <Poetro> EugenA: you still should have access to jQuery variable
[16:40:11] <Poetro> EugenA: like Drupal 7 does add jQuery noConflict
[16:40:50] <Poetro> unless someone totally removed jQuery from the global namespace with jQuery.noConflict(true)
[16:41:14] <EugenA> Poetro: yes, i'm trying to use backstretch script with Drupal 7
[16:41:36] <Poetro> EugenA: then use the jQuery variable name instead of $
[16:41:54] <Poetro> or check some of the already loaded JS files for how they do it
[16:42:02] -Poetro- EugenA: like
[16:42:31] <Poetro> (function ($) {  yourcodehere; }(jQuery));
[16:42:34] <EugenA> working
[16:43:22] <EugenA> thanks
[16:43:49] <Poetro> EugenA: u should look at JS files in the misc directory for further guidance on the topic
[16:44:58] <daverau> I'm not sure how to approach saving multiple days worth of this form to local storage; right now it saves only the current day, but I'd like to save multiple days.

[16:46:08] <otiuk> what's the best way to detect if someone left a field empty?
[16:46:38] <nFFF> .val
[16:46:41] <nFFF> length
[16:48:40] <ProLoser|Work> anyone know of a json generator for testing purposes?
[16:48:44] <ProLoser|Work> that i can include in my app?
[16:49:16] <Poetro> ProLoser|Work: what kind of JSON would u want to generate?
[16:49:23] <ProLoser|Work> just a templated one
[16:49:28] <ProLoser|Work> i don't get how it matters
[16:49:43] <otiuk> nFFF: what event to bind to?
[16:50:08] <Poetro> ProLoser|Work: every language have a function to spit out json... why would u want a generator?
[16:50:17] <nFFF> probably when they click the form submit button
[16:50:19] <Poetro> u build an object and convert it to json
[16:50:28] <nFFF> check the form to see  if any values are empty
[16:50:30] <otiuk> i'd like to detect while they are filling it in
[16:50:46] <ProLoser|Work> Poetro: i want junk data
[16:50:47] <Poetro> otiuk: maybe check on blur, focus, change
[16:51:14] <otiuk> ya i have been trying to catch it with blur.. but for some reason it isn't work
[16:51:16] <otiuk> ing

[16:57:13] <GhostCat> Is there a way to change the contents of a tag without effecting its formatting and structure using jquery?
[16:57:19] <ProLoser|Work> johnkpaul: got a non-node version?

[16:59:33] <RedLabor> anybody familiar with dumbFormState? I'm trying to extend it to save multiple days worth of journal entries for this simple form: http://daverau.info/happy/
[16:59:34] <Poetro> GhostCat: what do u mean?
[16:59:37] <Poetro> .text?
[16:59:43] <Poetro> ?text
[16:59:43] <bot-t> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[16:59:56] <GhostCat> Poetro, I have a div containing a form, the form needs to stay intact but the ID# that the user sees needs to change
[17:00:05] <GhostCat> It's just written in plain old markup
[17:00:14] <GhostCat> But it doesn't have an element unto itself
[17:00:14] <Poetro> GhostCat: what id#?
[17:00:24] <GhostCat> I'll paste a line, just a sec
[17:00:34] <Poetro> GhostCat: there are ways to do that imo
[17:00:42] <Caphalex> Hey. How can I provide the following feature: In MS Word if I want to insert a table I can choose using the  mouse the number of rows and cols... I'd like to make something, too - How could I do that?
[17:00:52] <otiuk> Poetro: does it matter if the text field is named something and the id is set to start?
[17:01:44] <Poetro> GhostCat: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-replacetext/examples/replacetext/
[17:01:56] <GhostCat> <div id="num2"><form>#3:<input type="text" name="name2" onfocus="execute(2)"><button value="button" onclick="dostuff(2);" type="button">Action</button></form></div>
[17:01:57] <Poetro> otiuk: not really
[17:02:10] <otiuk> ok cool lemme see if i can make it work
[17:02:11] <GhostCat> Poetro, In the above, the "#3" needs to change to a "#2" to match the rest of the pointers
[17:02:23] <Poetro> GhostCat: ^^
[17:02:26] <GhostCat> I've already gone through and modified the other fields with .attr()
[17:02:33] <GhostCat> .text is still what I'm looking for?
[17:02:47] <Poetro> GhostCat: no, that plugin from Ben Alman
[17:03:52] <RedLabor> would you guys use a plugin to save form data to local storage? or do it from scratch?
[17:04:04] <GhostCat> Poetro, Wouldn't there be a way to do it without a plugin?  That seems messy for such a simple task jquery should be able to do by itself
[17:04:10] <johnkpaul> ProLoser|Work: no but maybe with node browserify?
[17:04:27] <Poetro> GhostCat: then just look at the source and grab what u need
[17:04:44] <Poetro> GhostCat: it is not a trivial thing
[17:05:04] <Poetro> GhostCat: but the plugin is just a few lines of code
[17:05:58] <otiuk> Poetro: i am thinking jquery isn't loading or something because it doesn't focus when document loads.. and then when i manual click on the field and then hit tab nothing happens... what's the easiest way to make sure jquery.js is loading?
[17:06:37] <Poetro> otiuk: check the network tab to see how all the scripts are loading in the order u expect them
[17:07:13] <Poetro> otiuk: and if u r using a framework it might add jQuery.noConflict, like Drupal does
[17:08:09] <otiuk> no framework.. lemme check network
[17:09:09] <otiuk> Poetro: it shoes jquery loading like #5 but the code i'm adding is on page would that make a different?
[17:09:13] <otiuk> difference*
[17:09:44] <Poetro> otiuk: is your code AFTER jquery is loaded
[17:09:58] <Poetro> like is it after the jquery.js script tag?
[17:10:29] <otiuk> yes it's the next line after those is the <script type="text/javascript"> then next line: $(document).ready(function() {
[17:10:51] <Poetro> otiuk: and do u c any errors in the console tab?
[17:10:53] <otiuk> meaning the on page javascript is right after the imported
[17:12:34] <otiuk> SyntaxError: Invalid character '\u8203'
[17:13:32] <Poetro_> otiuk: then u should fix that
[17:13:55] <otiuk> $(document).ready(function() {
[17:15:50] <otiuk> i don't know which character it is
[17:26:42] <venxi> hello
[17:26:52] <venxi> i'm trying to get text from a div at http://commitcode.com/nn/ace/
[17:27:05] <venxi> i have: var a = $(".ace_layer ace_text-layer ace_line").text();
[17:31:52] <otiuk> poetro: anyway to have it not automatically add the the "you missed a form field" notice when you focus on the field?
[17:32:07] <shoky> venxi, that would select all <ace_line> tags that are inside <ace_text-layer> tags that are inside tags with 'ace_layer' class
[17:32:15] <shoky> which is hardly what you want
[17:34:54] <venxi> each one of those is a class of a div. so if i want to get all the text in all the ace_line div classes then what would be best. i'm trying var a = $(".ace_layer .ace_text-layer .ace_line").text();
[17:35:44] <otiuk> poetro: anyway to have it not automatically add the the "you missed a form field" notice when you focus on the field?
[17:36:20] <venxi> here is what the dom looks like: http://commitcode.com/p/r/57qr233Gpzb.html
[17:36:53] <shoky> venxi, i think you want $(".ace_layer.ace_text-layer .ace_line").text();
[17:37:42] <shoky> though that selectes multiple divs
[17:40:59] <Lattyware> Hey all, I'm trying to use autocomplete, but my form doesn't change in any way.
[17:41:01] <Lattyware> http://pastebin.com/vGTfKuU7
[17:41:20] <Lattyware> That's the relevant code, can anyone see anything glaring wrong with it?
[17:44:02] <venxi> ah, i missed a div
[17:44:14] <venxi> here is the paste. one of the div's has no id or class name
[17:44:15] <venxi> http://commitcode.com/p/r/xW4c8e4vekq.html
[17:44:30] <venxi> what is the easiest way give that to get all the text from ace_line div's
[17:46:18] <shoky> $('div.ace_line').text() ?
[17:47:03] <venxi> lol, nice! thanks :)
[17:47:59] <shoky> np ;p
[17:48:14] <catcher> Lattyware, you should try renaming your function to something other than 'autocomplete'.
[17:48:38] <Lattyware> and there is something I didn't even think about
[17:49:03] <reddobowen> Hey there everyone, would someone be able to help me with a colour box problem? If you go to this page, http://www.sphilipevans.co.uk/whatson?locale=en you'll see a click here to view the latest newsletter button. That loads up perfectly in a colour box, however if you click on the calendar, to say the 11th of march, and click the newsletter link which appears in the area below, that just loads on a separate page? Wh
[17:49:03] <reddobowen> I doing wrong? :)
[17:49:13] <Lattyware> catcher: Still the same renaming it to 'ac'
[17:49:37] <catcher> Lattyware, you renamed the function and the call to it?
[17:49:48] <Lattyware> yeah
[17:50:33] <jahrichie> Hey guys, i'm using a link to activate a slide in my carousel href="javascript:stepcarousel.stepTo('companyDirectors', 1)"   --  I need that click to also scroll that div to the top of the screen also, what's the easiest way to do this? I obviously can't use a inner # link, is there something I could do wit ha class or id that's easy?
[17:51:03] <Lattyware> It's just odd - all of the things I can thing to test work.
[17:51:54] <jahrichie> i can link you if you want
[17:53:11] <Lattyware> ah, am I being a derp, I think it adds &term=term not just the term
[17:53:14] <Lattyware> let me try presuming that
[17:56:04] <Lattyware> Nope, still nothing.
[17:56:44] <catcher> Lattyware, do you have it on a public site?
[17:57:50] <Lattyware> no, I'm testing on my machine
[17:57:53] <Lattyware> I'm afraid
[17:58:34] <catcher> Lattyware, have you firebugged for errors, and checked to make sure the dropdown isn't being obscured by an aggressive z-index below it?
[17:59:33] <otiuk> poetro: anyway to have it not automatically add the the "you missed a form field" notice when you focus on the field?
[18:00:37] <Lattyware> ah, I got it working, I had another script that was failing and causing the error
[18:00:38] <Lattyware> ugh
[18:00:59] <Poetro> otiuk: u just check if the field is focused
[18:01:02] <catcher> Lattyware, glad it's worked out!
[18:01:04] <Lattyware> sorry, cheers for the help - I was looking at firebug but didn't notice it.
[18:01:15] <Lattyware> full derp on my part.
[18:01:16] <Poetro> otiuk: like subscribe to the focus event
[18:01:18] <Lattyware> but there we go
[18:01:37] <otiuk> lol sounds easy just wish i knew more of jquery to get it accomplished
[18:01:39] <catcher> Lattyware, will you do me a favor and check if it works if it's called 'autocomplete'?
[18:02:01] <Lattyware> sure
[18:02:03] <catcher> Lattyware, curious if it's smart enough to namespace like that.
[18:02:15] <Poetro> otiuk: like .on('focus', function () {})
[18:02:31] <Lattyware> catcher: Yup, just tested, works fine
[18:02:44] <Lattyware> so apparently so
[18:02:52] <catcher> Lattyware, bummer, that confuses things.
[18:02:53] <Poetro> otiuk: and then set up a variable, to not add the notice, then clear that on blur
[18:03:24] <Lattyware> hrm, that's interesting, it's not styling the autocomplete list, however
[18:03:28] <otiuk> ok so i could do a $('.required').focus(function() { $(this).next('.notice) { notice.text(''); });
[18:03:31] <otiuk> or something like that?
[18:05:00] <Poetro> otiuk: $('.required').focus(function() { $(this).next('.notice).text(''); });
[18:05:18] <Poetro> or something similar
[18:07:28] <oojacoboo> with .on() if you're delegating, how do you call the object for which the event is being delegated?
[18:07:28] <otiuk> ya i add that in but then it gives the page an unexpected eof?
[18:07:44] <oojacoboo> it's not $(this) or $(event.target)
[18:08:12] <Poetro> otiuk: maybe use a better editor / ide that highlights closing brackets
[18:08:36] <Poetro> or does linting
[18:09:02] <oojacoboo> anyone?
[18:12:34] <otiuk> ya it was a missing quote... but it doesn't reset span on focus :/
[18:15:29] <shoky> oojacoboo, event.delegateTarget perhaps
[18:15:31] <raj> can I trust that .children() will always be in the same order?
[18:15:37] <oojacoboo> shadykhan: na
[18:15:42] <oojacoboo> shoky: *
[18:15:56] <oojacoboo> $(event.target) was correct, it was something else causing the issue
[18:16:00] <oojacoboo> thanks though
[18:16:37] <otiuk> Poetro: i just removed keyup and keypress and then it leaves the span empty until they try to get out of the field without typing something
[18:17:02] <Poetro> otiuk: that is another solution
[18:17:34] <otiuk> will that work for select and checkboxes and what not too/
[18:30:19] <RobW> jqueryui.. how can I use datepicker() and select a date, then automatically populate another field with +1 month?
[18:45:52] <shoky> RobW, just use the onSelect event
[18:55:10] <RedLabor> How to I turn this data structure into a javascript object I can turn into JSON? http://pastebin.com/cN9jifJu
[19:00:52] <syborg> RedLabor: in your code the variable happy is a javascript object
[19:01:24] <syborg> I think you might find the JSON object's stringify of some use
[19:01:28] <RedLabor> syborg to turn that into json I stringily?
[19:01:37] <syborg> http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_Section_15.htm#Section_15.12
[19:01:45] <RedLabor> will do, thanks
[19:02:02] <RedLabor> I just wanted to be sure I was on the right track for building that object
[19:02:48] <RedLabor> syborg how would you add a new date node? happy.push()?
[19:04:40] <syborg> RedLabor: happy['some-new-date'] = {};
[19:04:59] <RedLabor> syborg ah ok, sweet! that makes sense
[19:32:57] <RedLabor> syborg if I wanted to output just a happy.date, how would I do that? something like happy.index
[19:35:07] <syborg> RedLabor: happy['index']
[19:36:04] <syborg> you can loop through all the properties of the object with $.each(happy, function (index, value) { .. });
[19:36:38] <RedLabor> great, thanks so much
[19:36:40] <RedLabor> this is super helpful
[19:42:54] <jerricao> hello. when developing a jquery plugin, can i store the jquery object in data()?
[19:43:50] <jerricao> element.data( "myPlugin", this ) from within the plugin code?
[19:46:23] <syborg> jerricao: Yes, you should be able to do that. The .data method allows you to attach data of any type
[19:47:43] <syborg> realize though that javascript pases objects by reference so its really a pointer to this that you'd be storing
[19:48:51] <RedLabor> syborg Thanks for all your help. is there a way to jump indexes, like next/prev happy['index'].next?
[19:49:04] <jerricao> should i just be using the widget factory to avoid all these little things?
[19:49:50] <syborg> jerricao: I don't know what you are doing but probably yes
[19:50:10] <jerricao> is there any reason really not to?
[19:51:34] <gdr> something's just about to break
[19:52:00] <syborg> jerricao: if you need something highly customized that wont be reused, widget factory may provide too much overhead but generally its a good thing
[19:52:55] <jerricao> okay i should just use it then :)
[19:55:41] <syborg> RedLabor: If you need more than just accessing the properties directly or looping, you can turn it into an array with $.makeArray and use stand array iteration conventions
[19:55:58] <syborg> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
[19:58:47] <RedLabor> syborg my object will be filled with dates, but not always sequential so I'm wanting to navigate prev() through the object without searching or turning the entire potentially large JSON object into an array
[19:59:04] <Whirl3d> when preloading images for a slideshow, I can load them sequestially into the same img element, just applying the new src attribute and handling the load callback,, right. There's no need to have multiple img elements during preload is there?
[20:01:50] <RedLabor> syborg i see arrays are better for order, so I'll investigate that more. thanks
[20:02:02] <syborg> RedLabor: I'd probaby store the dates as epoch, then insert sorted
[20:02:42] <syborg> integers are always better when comparing
[20:02:56] <RedLabor> yeah good call
[20:27:21] <hagabaka> I'm trying to get a grid-table which I can edit by cell, add/remove columns, and examine values as a nested array. Is there a plugin that does those and as few other things as possible?
[20:38:20] <equilibrium> hi ppls, pls help i'm having a simple problem using the jquery-ui toggle button widgets... they display and visually toggle, but i cant seem to trigger their actions in the way the regular jquery-ui buttons work with $('#navigatebtn').click(function() ...
[20:39:11] <equilibrium> need some sort of onUpdate tag perhaps and use the .checked property
[20:39:35] <equilibrium> but i'm not sure whether it needs to be declared as a checkbox in some other way.. :-s
[20:46:41] <coldhead> equilibrium: perhaps you could use ?on
[20:46:41] <bot-t> equilibrium, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:46:53] <coldhead> instead of click()
[20:48:11] <equilibrium> thanks, am lookin at it
[20:49:27] <equilibrium> ah yeah, i had googled up one post which used 'live' which looks like older version of 'on'...
[20:49:34] <equilibrium> msut be the way to go
[20:52:36] <equilibrium> ah got working i think now
[21:06:21] <RedLabor> syborg hey mate, would this JSON format serve me better so I can find by date, but iterate next/prev easily? http://pastebin.com/GfTuPpMs
[21:09:55] <syborg> RedLabor: That doesn't look valid...
[21:10:08] <RedLabor> yeah, i'm not sure how to structure it
[21:10:36] <RedLabor> trying to give each entry a numbered index
[21:10:57] <RedLabor> I should just keep date as a child node
[21:12:06] <syborg> if you want a numbered index, why not just use an array and have the date be a property of each object in the array?
[21:28:40] <AlbireoX> Hi, how would I get a raw file as a string encoded in base64?
[21:30:29] <systemfault> AlbireoX: Using a server-side proxy?
[21:33:52] <AlbireoX> systemfault: is this the only way?
[21:34:59] <systemfault> XHR2 I guess...
[21:35:07] <systemfault> Not really compatible though.
[21:39:31] <psiame> when developing a jquery plugin ( widget factory in this case ) what's the conventional way to add a global function to the namespace?
[21:40:16] <snizzzzle> I have syntax errors somewhere in my javascript code.  How can I get information abotu what the errors are and at which line?
[21:40:30] <snizzzzle> U know like running gcc...
[21:41:54] <coldhead> firebug/web inspector/your preferred browser's debugger should show you in the console
[21:42:00] <coldhead> props for coming to JS from GCC
[21:43:43] <tw2113> mmm inspectors
[21:49:21] <toothr> snizzzzle, jshint can help too for catching some crap
[21:54:50] <_zoggy_> need to update topic, 1.7.2 is out
[22:03:43] <krn0> hello
[22:08:23] <systemfault> Is it me you're looking for?
[22:11:56] <krn0> killing time lol
[22:14:16] <jmoreira81> question about ajax....
[22:16:14] <jmoreira81> what's the url '/flight/'? http://pastebin.com/z6V9XAAx
[22:53:13] <Whirl3d> so if I append an image element to the dom and assign a load handler to it, then add a data object to it, apply the src , does it lose the data object when it loads?
[22:54:17] <donCams> i wonder how much they paid the developer for this site http://www.barneysvideoresume.com/
[22:59:03] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: It shouldn't, can you reproduce in a fiddle?
[23:01:24] <Whirl3d> pifantastic, thanks for the reply. I think I just found my error. Rahter than enclosing my img tag in a <img> to add a new image to the dom, I used $("img").appendTo(".....I think that'll solve the problem. Thanks.
[23:02:02] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: yep, that would do it
[23:02:10] <Whirl3d> well, maybe not. I'll setup a fiddle to try it out
[23:04:00] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/Wq6NM/
[23:06:33] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Jat8n/
[23:06:48] <Whirl3d> So I take it the argument returned from load is not what I thought it was
[23:07:40] <someprimetime> is it possible to insert text dynamically with a <br> in it? like say i want to go $('#js-target-div').text($(this).attr('alt')); $('#js-target-div').html('<br />') <-- insert that within the text i just inserted but like maybe halfway through the text
[23:08:31] <someprimetime> say the alt="Register or login to favorite this" and I want to grab the alt, put it into a target div, and then additionally insert a <br /> in the middle of the alt text just inserted e.g.: Register or login <br /> to favorite this
[23:09:20] <Whirl3d> you can insert any html string and apply it. So, yes, you should be able to.
[23:10:48] <pifantastic> Sorry Whirl3d, I dropped for a second
[23:11:08] <Whirl3d> $(target).html($(elem).attr("alt").replace("login", "login<br />")); shoudl work
[23:11:23] <someprimetime> what native js methods allow me to insert within a string? woudl i just split the string into two parts and then add the additional one and join the 3?
[23:11:47] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: well it's not always going to be the text login
[23:11:52] <someprimetime> it'll just be half of the length
[23:12:16] <pifantastic> someprimetime: JavaScript does not have any native string formatting methods.
[23:14:06] <Whirl3d> so, how do I keep from losing the reference to the thing I am loading inside the callback for a load handler?
[23:14:36] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: did you see my example?
[23:14:41] <pifantastic> Seemed to work for me
[23:14:52] <Whirl3d> in other words, $(someImg).load(handleLoad).attr('src", url)...    sorry, I didn't. Lemme look at it.
[23:17:06] <Whirl3d> This is an attempt to make a simple serail preloader.
[23:18:04] <Whirl3d> complete out of context, and probably has some other issues since I just yanked it from a bigger script...http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Jat8n/3/
[23:19:13] <Whirl3d> its gotta be the parameters of my load handler. A jquery event is being passed to the load handler, not the image element.
[23:22:14] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: yeah, you want to use $(this) in your load handler to get the element
[23:23:32] <Whirl3d> I just figured that out. .But when I pass it to the addSlide function, I must mess it up again.
[23:24:04] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: `this` will be the DOMElement, $(this) will make it a jQuery object
[23:24:34] <Whirl3d> Okay, it helps if you use the same data parameter names...duh!
[23:24:37] <Whirl3d> lol
[23:24:41] <Whirl3d>  Thanks for your help.
[23:25:20] <pifantastic> np
