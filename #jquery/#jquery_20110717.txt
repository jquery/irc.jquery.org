[00:26:39] <sonuloveu> good morning Jquery :)
[00:27:02] <dr0id> morning buddy
[00:41:24] <sonuloveu> dr0id, I have one question in jquery can you help me out?
[00:42:51] <dr0id> I can
[00:42:57] <dr0id> but have to leave for now, brb later
[00:44:11] <dr0id> ask your question anyway
[00:50:34] <coldhead> yes, ask anyway
[00:53:49] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me what methods are available to me in jquery so i could prevent the thumbnails on the right from "rewinding" (i'm currently using scrollTo, and i think that's what's causing it). just looking for ideas of what function/plugin to read up on...
[00:53:56] <ezrafree> Linkadmin: http://www.websightdesigns.com/demos/slider-thumbs-down-clickable/
[00:54:10] <ezrafree> oops, not Linkadmin, i meant that to say "link: "
[00:55:34] <ezrafree> http://jsfiddle.net/rSpeJ/2/ <-- maybe this link is easier
[01:03:32] <Shazer2> jQuery 1.4.4?
[01:06:06] <ezrafree> Shazer2: i'm not really picky which version it's done in... that's what was selected by default i believe
[01:06:16] <sonuloveu> coldhead, I have three extension
[01:09:46] <coldhead> i see
[01:18:52] <Shazer2> omg.
[01:18:55] <Shazer2> WHY
[01:22:04] <ezrafree> Shazer2: ?
[01:22:19] <coldhead> counsel must show relevance
[01:22:34] <Shazer2> ezrafree
[01:22:39] <Shazer2> im trying to check a condition
[01:22:46] <Shazer2> of whether both passwords entered
[01:22:55] <Shazer2> are the same, they are, yet it says registration is successful!
[01:22:56] <malinens> How to check if selector has selected element? I use .remove mothod but it'ssometimes workd and sometimes dosn't work...
[01:23:27] <coldhead> Shazer2: you are sure you're not comparing one of the fiels with itself?
[01:23:32] <coldhead> fields*
[01:23:41] <Shazer2> else if ($rpassword != $rrpassword) {
[01:23:41] <Shazer2> 		echo $count == 0 ? "diffpass:true" : "diffpass:false";
[01:23:41] <Shazer2> 	}
[01:23:47] <Shazer2> 100percent sure
[01:25:33] <Shazer2> ah
[01:25:35] <Shazer2> i changed the check
[01:25:36] <Shazer2> echo $rpassword != $rrpassword ? "diffpass:true" : "diffpass:false";
[01:25:42] <Shazer2> buttttttt
[01:25:46] <Shazer2> it still goes false
[01:25:48] <Shazer2> o.O
[01:27:31] <Shazer2> coldhead
[01:27:32] <coldhead> http://codepad.org/mHsLHpYH
[01:27:33] <Shazer2> you there?
[01:27:41] <coldhead> really looks like they should fail if they're different
[01:28:09] <coldhead> http://codepad.org/UevIqBzD
[01:28:18] <coldhead> they match if you cast them to numbers
[01:28:21] <coldhead> so don't do that :)
[01:32:54] <Shazer2> echo $rpassword != $rrpassword ? "diffpass:true" : "diffpass:false";  <--- this reads to me as, echo out boolean of if passwords match if its true diffpass:true else diffpass:false
[01:33:31] <coldhead> uh echo is weird
[01:33:36] <ezrafree> http://jsfiddle.net/rSpeJ/2/ <-- can anyone take a look at this and tell me how to avoid the "rewinding" after it goes through all the thumbs on the right?
[01:33:40] <coldhead> try echo (stuff here)
[01:33:42] <coldhead> or print
[01:35:02] <Shazer2> coldhead
[01:35:02] <Shazer2> nothing
[01:35:04] <Shazer2> so annoying
[01:35:42] <coldhead> #php, Shazer2?
[01:36:17] <ezrafree> i was just wondering if i'm even in #jquery ;)
[01:36:40] <Shazer2> ezrafree, HAHAHAHA
[01:36:46] <Shazer2> go solve your simple problem
[01:36:51] <Shazer2> and stop spamming the same question
[01:36:52] <Shazer2> hurr
[01:38:44] <ezrafree> Shazer2: thanks that was such a helpful point in the right direction, heh
[01:38:47] <MoTiOnXml> djQuery: -> priv.
[01:40:04] <coldhead> ezrafree: you just want it to stop when it gets to the end?
[01:44:14] <coldhead> don't feel obliged in any way to answer

[01:44:32] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[01:57:49] <Shazer2> is there a way to update sql with jquery?
[02:15:19] <juha___> yes
[02:20:43] <movexig> So, uh, I have a problem in need of a solution. tl;dr, I have an XMLDocument I got from an xmlhttprequest, which I wrap with jquery and attempt to use find() on, but it never finds anything, even when I know they exist. What could be the issue?
[02:21:28] <coldhead> jQuery isn't great at handling xml
[02:21:42] <coldhead> are you telling jQuery to expect XML?
[02:21:54] <movexig> Not explicitly. What do I need to do?
[02:22:11] <movexig> I should add that this is a GreaseMonkey script, by the way.
[02:22:18] <coldhead> if you load with ajax() you can specify the XML datatype
[02:22:20] <coldhead> check the docs
[02:22:22] <coldhead> ?ajax
[02:22:22] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[02:23:04] <movexig> Since this is GreaseMonkey, I am using GM's xmlhttprequest facility, and no jQuery.ajax.
[02:23:11] <movexig> *not
[02:23:19] <movexig> I do have an XMLDocument object, though.
[02:24:20] <coldhead> so then you just go $(ur_xml) ?
[02:25:12] <coldhead> there is also
[02:25:19] <coldhead> ?parsexml
[02:25:20] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery.parseXML() - Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[02:25:24] <coldhead> lol sex
[02:25:24] <movexig> Yes. But when I attempt to .find() on that object, it finds nothing.
[02:25:35] <movexig> Even though I know the named nodes exist.
[02:25:56] <coldhead> so maybe try var $thing = $.parseXML( ur_xml );
[02:26:14] <coldhead> $thing.find('grossxml')
[02:26:37] <coldhead> and if that doesn't work, try retrieving ur_xml as a string, not XML, and use parseXML on that
[02:26:48] <coldhead> and if that doesn't work i'm out of ideas, sorry
[02:27:03] <movexig> It is a string, and it is parsed, and I have a valid XMLDocument. jQuery just won't find anything in it.
[02:27:20] <coldhead> i understand
[02:27:38] <coldhead> i am suggesting ways you can help jQuery get its head around the XML
[02:27:53] <coldhead> which is what seems to be the problem
[02:32:49] <movexig> $.parseXML just seems to crash.
[02:33:46] <movexig> Bah, the X(H)TML isn't as well-formed as I had expected. Oh well.
[02:34:24] <movexig> All right, change of plans, change of question. Is there a convenient way of traversing a string of tag soup HTML with jQuery?
[02:46:32] <yrik_> Is it possible to automatically show default jquery-mobile ajax loader when I call $.post()?
[03:15:40] <ExpertOrBust> Hey guys do I need to use labels in my forms?
[03:15:47] <ExpertOrBust> for jquery
[03:17:14] <coldhead> god no
[03:17:20] <coldhead> that would be very rude of jQuery to demand that
[03:21:48] <callumacrae> I'm trying to use .serialize to serialize a form, but it isn't working as expected
[03:21:51] <callumacrae> http://jsfiddle.net/mtLWj/
[03:22:18] <callumacrae> It should produce post_id_list[]=73&action=approve
[03:25:00] <movexig> Well, for the record, I got it to work, though it was more complicated than expected.
[03:29:07] <coldhead> wanna talk about it, movexig ?
[03:29:48] <movexig> Sure. In the end, I had to circumvent jQuery and do it with native functions.
[03:30:00] <movexig> createContextualFragment solved the issue, since it can parse tag soup.
[03:30:08] <coldhead> god thanks for nothing, jQuery
[03:30:12] <movexig> Still couldn't wrap that with $() though, but getElementsByTagName did it.
[03:30:17] <coldhead> ah okay, thanks for sharing
[03:30:29] <movexig> And I could wrap each individual node that returned, so.
[03:31:15] <coldhead> better to avoid bad formed xml huh
[03:33:09] <movexig> Well, it's HTML, and a page I don't have control over.
[03:33:32] <coldhead> yeah i figured
[03:33:37] <coldhead> a curse on the original author
[03:34:42] <coldhead> callumacrae: http://jsfiddle.net/mtLWj/1/
[03:35:20] <callumacrae> Still need the action, but I guess that can't be done using .serialize - where in the event itself would I find it?
[03:35:55] <coldhead> i would just use ajaxform
[03:36:00] <coldhead> or failing that, see how it does it
[03:36:21] <coldhead> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[03:37:24] <callumacrae> Thanks, I'll try that
[03:39:05] <Shazer2> coldhead
[03:40:02] <coldhead> hi
[03:40:29] <Shazer2> do you know if its possible to access an array in a while loop with jquery from a php file
[03:40:47] <Chib> codeception?
[03:40:55] <coldhead> lol Chib
[03:41:18] <coldhead> i don't understand what you mean, Shazer2
[03:41:29] <coldhead> i can think of a few things which you might mean which work
[03:41:33] <coldhead> but please be more specific
[03:41:39] <Shazer2> okay
[03:41:59] <Shazer2> you know when you fetch fromma database (SELECT) then you do while ($rows = mysql_fetch_array(query)) {}
[03:42:09] <coldhead> yes
[03:42:13] <Shazer2> i need to access $rows['username'] from jquery
[03:43:23] <coldhead> echo '<script> var this_is_js = "' . $rows['username'] .'"; </script>'; ?
[03:46:27] <Shazer2> how do i access from another file? (js)
[03:47:51] <coldhead> in your someotherfile.js you will be able to access this_is_js
[03:48:05] <coldhead> alert( this_is_js );
[03:48:33] <coldhead> like how you can access jQuery from somefile.js even though jQuery is defined in jQuery.js
[03:57:55] <Shazer2> coldhead
[03:57:56] <Shazer2> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object DOMWindow] has no method 'toArray'
[03:58:36] <coldhead> i didn't say anything about toArray
[03:58:41] <coldhead> ?p @ Shazer2
[03:58:41] <bot-t> Shazer2, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:58:47] <coldhead> show me the code you're running
[03:58:53] <coldhead> the JS
[03:59:22] <coldhead> callumacrae: any joy?
[04:00:15] <callumacrae> It works, now I just need to persuade the people I'm coding for to let me include it xD
[04:01:01] <coldhead> tell them it's been around for a long time and is actively debugged and developed support etc etc
[04:01:13] <coldhead> its heavily tested
[04:01:51] <dr0id> dam
[04:02:02] <dr0id> Shazer2: how do we make it now ?
[04:02:04] <callumacrae> "really shouldn't be needed, jQuery provides most of what you need" :(
[04:02:45] <Shazer2> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/h2p5E/
[04:04:02] <coldhead> callumacrae: jQuery isn't really needed, javascript provides everything you need >: |
[04:04:33] <Shazer2> :/
[04:05:02] <callumacrae> XD
[04:05:33] <ezrafree> coldhead: no, when it gets to the end I want it to just keep cycling through. that is, when it gets to the end just show the first one and start over, looping through infinitely...
[04:05:33] <Shazer2> coldhead
[04:05:35] <Shazer2> what about for me
[04:05:58] <coldhead> i am trying to fix your thing too, Shazer2
[04:06:02] <coldhead> don't worry little fella
[04:06:16] <ariefbayu> guys, I've question. I don't know what keyword to use on google. Here's the situation: I want to have scrollable element inside div. This element is scrollable using mouse drag left or right.
[04:06:27] <ariefbayu> what's the proper query to google?
[04:08:00] <skython> I have a problem with the jquery.ui slider, when i focus any input field and then hover over the slider its displayed like a link to my site followed by a '#' . Is there a way to disable this behaviour ?
[04:09:35] <Shazer2> ok colehead
[04:09:38] <Shazer2> coldhead*
[04:10:04] <coldhead> Shazer2: your code does not have toArray so it is not clear where the error is occuring. you need to try commenting out different lines of your code until the error goes away. then you will know what to fix
[04:12:19] <coldhead> callumacrae: http://jsfiddle.net/rSpeJ/7/ is that what you mean?
[04:12:47] <callumacrae> 911 -> ?
[04:12:51] <callumacrae> ?*
[04:13:16] <coldhead> beg pardon, callumacrae
[04:13:23] <coldhead> ezrafree: : http://jsfiddle.net/rSpeJ/7/ is that what you mean?
[04:13:28] <coldhead> too much beers >: |
[04:13:49] <Chib> blasphemy!
[04:14:08] <Chib> as an australian, i take issue with your comment sir
[04:14:21] <Shazer2> no more error coldhead
[04:14:22] <Shazer2> but
[04:14:25] <Shazer2> no working code
[04:14:26] <Shazer2> lol
[04:14:54] <Shazer2> its just the trouble of getting a var from php into jquery
[04:14:55] <Shazer2> annoying
[04:15:56] <Chib> can't you just drop it in a hidden span with an id somewhere?
[04:15:58] <coldhead> no it is something else, Shazer2
[04:17:00] <Shazer2> echo "<script>var userJS = " . $rows['username'] . ";</script>";
[04:17:16] <ezrafree> coldhead: that example appears to still be "rewinding" so to speak. that is, the thumbs on the right are going downwards, and then once they are done they go upwards back up to the first one. any way to just make it constantly revolve? i don't mind writing the code myself i'm just not sure where to even start to do that... looking for advice...
[04:17:53] <Symbi0nt|GER> i need to execute two jquery things after another
[04:18:16] <Symbi0nt|GER> first is jQuery.extend .. is there a nice way to wait until the first is ready?
[04:18:38] <coldhead> i don't know then, ezrafree
[04:19:07] <coldhead> i don't understand the rewinding apparently
[04:20:07] <ezrafree> coldhead: if you speed it up it's easier to see what i mean: http://jsfiddle.net/rSpeJ/9/
[04:20:30] <Shazer2> coldhead
[04:20:31] <Shazer2> it is

[04:22:49] <Shazer2> im out of ideas now
[04:25:04] <RobertV-> anyone know if jsfiddle.net has a shortcut key to run code (instead of having to click 'run' with the mouse)?
[04:26:00] <Shazer2> ctrl+s
[04:26:16] <coldhead> Shazer2: try replacing userJS with window.userJS everywhere
[04:27:10] <RobertV-> ctrl+center

[04:38:52] <sonuloveu> hmm
[04:38:53] <dr0id> you have to upgrade your plugins!
[04:39:03] <sonuloveu> thing is that 1.4.1.min.js
[04:39:39] <sonuloveu> how to upgrade plugins lol
[04:39:44] <coldhead> ezrafree: http://jsfiddle.net/rSpeJ/12/
[04:39:57] <dr0id> by fixing the erroneous code - if you have written them, then it shouldn't be hard
[04:39:57] <coldhead> close as i can get off your description
[04:40:20] <dr0id> if its third part, then visit their websites - they might have uploaded the newer versions of the plugins that work with newer jquery versions
[04:40:23] <coldhead> if you need it to seem to scroll endlessly, man, you use a plugin for that shit :)
[04:40:28] <dr0id> nah
[04:40:34] <dr0id> I wrote my own custom code for enless scrolling
[04:40:37] <dr0id> heh :P
[04:40:43] <dr0id> WHERE'S THE FUN ? :O
[04:40:48] <coldhead> Shazer2: http://jsfiddle.net/h2p5E/3/ what i suggested can definitely work
[04:41:16] <coldhead> ezrafree: dr0id is volunteering to fix everything for you :D

[04:42:11] <coldhead> wait i think i remember that, dr0id
[04:42:11] <dr0id> coldhead: ohh, I was mistaken. I was talking about enless scrolling for pagination actually, heh
[04:42:21] <Shazer2> i am deleting users with jquery via URL ($_GET)
[04:42:26] <coldhead> someone we did one for that kept cloning <li>s forever until it ran out of RAM
[04:42:27] <Shazer2> so i need to post the username
[04:42:32] <dr0id> Shazer2: use POST bro
[04:42:32] <Shazer2> to the delete file
[04:42:39] <dr0id> no bro, post the user id
[04:42:40] <Shazer2> and set $_GET['user'] to the posted un
[04:42:47] <dr0id> you do every thing wrong bro
[04:42:53] <dr0id> how you gonna become mark zuck like that ?
[04:42:56] <dr0id> HOW ? :S

[04:44:34] <SoulRaven> hi
[04:44:58] <SoulRaven> i have some buttons on UI dialog, and i can't put icons on buttons
[04:45:10] <coldhead> Shazer2: http://jsfiddle.net/h2p5E/5/
[04:45:24] <SoulRaven> any ideea way? and how i init icons on button, when buttons are in ui dialog?
[04:45:47] <coldhead> you see how that uses the idea i was talkking about? if not, please ask more exhausting questions impatiently
[04:51:13] <sweb> how can i insert html to start of element ?
[04:51:15] <callumacrae> coldhead: Nah, the resulting string would have action=approve in it
[04:52:37] <SoulRaven> how to init button from ui dialog
[04:56:21] <coldhead> callumacrae: you don't want that? WHAT DO YOU WANT
[04:56:37] <coldhead> ?prepend @ sweb
[04:56:38] <bot-t> sweb, .prepend(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[04:57:00] <callumacrae> clicking Approve would result in action=approve&post_id_list[]=73
[04:57:16] <callumacrae> and disapprove would result in action=disapprove&post_id_list[]=73
[04:57:27] <callumacrae> It's fine though, I think I've persuaded them to use ajaxForm
[04:58:05] <coldhead> in my browser i see action[disapprove]=Disapprove&post_id_list[]=73
[04:58:11] <callumacrae> I reduced it from 911 lines to 145 by removing the features that we wouldn't need xD
[04:58:39] <coldhead> which is what the form seems to generate
[04:58:59] <coldhead> but i salute your file trimming, good luck!
[04:59:28] <callumacrae> I meant should, not would
[04:59:30] <callumacrae> >_<
[05:00:01] <SoulRaven> if i have multiple classes like this: addbutton, editbutton, printbutton, resetbutton
[05:00:22] <SoulRaven> how i select all the classes based only on the subfix of the class
[05:00:36] <SoulRaven> something like '*.button'
[05:00:40] <coldhead> suffix*
[05:00:41] <SoulRaven> or something
[05:01:02] <dilvie> do any of you use a shim for es5 features like forEach, filter, map, reduce, etc..?
[05:01:16] <SoulRaven> coldhead: ?? button*
[05:01:17] <SoulRaven> ?
[05:01:36] <coldhead> $('[class$="button"]') // slow
[05:01:57] <coldhead> it's better to give them classes like class="add button", class="edit button"
[05:02:14] <coldhead> then you can just use $('.button')
[05:02:21] <coldhead> make classes work for you!
[05:02:41] <SoulRaven> i want to do this, because i have some buttons, on ui dialog, and i can't unit the icons on the buttons
[05:03:09] <coldhead> well good luck with that
[05:05:15] <coldhead> dilvie: coffeescript? :D
[05:05:45] <dilvie> coldhead: um..
[05:06:40] <dilvie> I think I'll just copy-and-paste from mdn
[05:11:18] <sweb> how can i load my template from file from URL ? $( ??????? ).tmpl( data )   .appendTo( "body" );
[05:12:31] <dilvie> or maybe I'll just use underscore. =)
[05:13:02] <dilvie> sweb: check out the jquery load method
[05:13:19] <dilvie> sweb: you can skip the appendTo step
[05:14:45] <Shazer2> sweb
[05:14:48] <Shazer2> is your last name schwebel?
[05:15:25] <dr0id> ssup Shazer2
[05:15:32] <sweb> Shazer2, no men
[05:19:18] <daniel2011z> is it $('input[name=foo]') or $("input[name='foo']")
[05:19:52] <molavy> hi
[05:20:06] <molavy> why this submit form work just one time
[05:20:07] <molavy> http://jsfiddle.net/tjtd8/4/
[05:20:55] <molavy> when i use live instead of one in this line
[05:20:56] <molavy>    $("#changeform form").one("submit",function(event) {
[05:22:29] <molavy> form submitting time increasing  every time i click on "save change" button
[05:24:18] <coldhead> daniel2011z: you should ise the quotes
[05:24:20] <molavy> if i 2 time click on it ,at first time it submit 1 time and second time it submit 2 time
[05:24:21] <coldhead> use*
[05:24:36] <coldhead> no quotes is deprecated
[05:25:02] <daniel2011z> coldhead: you mean $("input[name='foo']")
[05:25:12] <coldhead> yes
[05:25:49] <daniel2011z> coldhead: when has it been deprecated?
[05:25:54] <molavy> any idea?
[05:25:58] <dr0id> coldhead: what ?
[05:27:07] <daniel2011z> no quotes is deprecated for some reason
[05:27:29] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[05:27:40] <coldhead> Quotes are mandatory.
[05:27:52] <dr0id> heh
[05:27:55] <coldhead> i don't know that they were ever allowed
[05:27:57] <towst> coldhead: why?
[05:28:03] <coldhead> without them i mean
[05:28:05] <towst> i mean what's the benefit
[05:28:30] <dr0id> you should do $('input[name="foo"]')
[05:28:46] <molavy> no idea?
[05:28:48] <coldhead> the benefit is your code is technically correct >: \
[05:29:04] <dr0id> heh
[05:29:04] <coldhead> also jQuery can probably parse your selector faster
[05:29:07] <daniel2011z> dr0id: yes
[05:29:13] <coldhead> or some voodoo crap, who knows
[05:29:14] <towst> circular reasoning much? :)
[05:29:16] <dr0id> mainly because in CSS we do input[name="foo"]
[05:29:22] <coldhead> it's only my first day using jQuery
[05:29:24] <towst> all right
[05:29:27] <dr0id> yeah, mine too
[05:29:49] <coldhead> molavy: my idea is that you are probably binding a new submit handler everytime you click
[05:30:03] <coldhead> but your code is too complicated for me to see where it is happening
[05:30:15] <coldhead> try redoing it from scratch, it should be cleaner :)
[05:30:27] <molavy> at end line's of js code
[05:30:57] <molavy> in function changeformload_submit(event,object,link,callback)
[05:31:49] <coldhead> $("#changeform form").unbind('submit').one("submit", function(event) {
[05:32:04] <coldhead> $("#changeform .exit").unbind('click').one("click", function(event) {
[05:32:59] <coldhead> that would be my quick fix, if i never had to look at the code again or deal with the people who would have to work wuth it later :)
[05:33:10] <coldhead> and i wouldn't even test it, i'd just say CASE CLOSED
[05:33:21] <coldhead> and go for a walk
[05:33:29] <coldhead> brb: going for a walk
[05:34:01] <coldhead> incidentally i think many of you are terribly rude and ungrateful
[05:34:10] <coldhead> and you should think hard about that
[05:38:23] <Shazer2> ?cc
[05:38:23] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[05:45:46] <molavy> coldhead:your code don't work,but as idea i change your quick fix code to :$("#changeform form").unbind('submit').bind("submit", function(event) {
[05:45:53] <molavy> and it work
[05:46:06] <molavy> thank you man
[05:47:32] <daniel2011z> molavy: just say thank you and be done with it :)
[06:04:15] <daniel2011z> Hmmm...this doesn't work on an ssl page..strange. jQuery(document).ready(function(){ alert("test"); });
[06:05:35] <juha___> daniel2011z: are you loading jquery from https?
[06:06:16] <daniel2011z> juha___: a http that gets redirect to same page but as https
[06:07:27] <daniel2011z> juha___: for example http://bog.com gets redirect to https://blog.com
[06:08:55] <daniel2011z> juha___: browser source shows script in head.... strange. Obviously in ssl mode jquery is not loaded
[06:09:20] <daniel2011z> juha___: or jquery is blocked in ssl mode?
[06:09:33] <lastk> hey guys, I have inserted some html dinamicaly on my form, but this is not styled with my theme, how I can apply the style? I know if is only a select I need do: $('select').selectmenu(); but I have a lot of inputs there
[06:09:52] <juha___> daniel2011z: try loading from https and not http https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js
[06:10:41] <daniel2011z> juha___: i'll try that
[06:11:58] <daniel2011z> juha___: actually src="https://..." so now even more strange
[06:12:40] <juha___> daniel2011z: do you have errors in console?
[06:13:08] <daniel2011z> juha___: i'll check.
[06:14:42] <daniel2011z> juha___: you know how to check errors in console in IE8?
[06:15:44] <juha___> f12
[06:17:51] <daniel2011z> juha___: and where are errors shown in f12?
[06:18:11] <wizbit> anybody here managed to get collapsable menus with arrows working?
[06:22:43] <callumacrae> Hmm, jquery.form.js suffers from the same bug that I was before
[06:34:27] <skython> why is the jquery-ui slider handle an anchor ? it shows a url if i hover over it. is there a way to disable that ?
[07:03:14] <mYrN> Hello! I have a custom metabox for wordpress using jquery to use the built in mediauploader to upload files for a imageslider. I can add more fields via javascript, and the problem arouses when i do just that. I can insert the imagelink perfectly in the first field, but if i add another field and try to add a new imagelink in that - it overwrites the otherone. I cant get the .prev() bit working
[07:03:14] <mYrN> correctly is my guess, but how do i get it to Just write it in the label Right above and not All of them? http://pastebin.com/BUJQvK3J
[07:08:46] <mYrN> anyone? :<
[07:11:31] <fgfg> hi
[07:25:30] <pr0ton> hello
[07:25:38] <pr0ton> how do you automatically resize divs

[07:31:59] <Anticom> hi all
[07:32:35] <Anticom> i'm trying to get the jq ui autocomplete running but somehow i'm failing all the time... would be nice, if someone could take a look at it http://jsfiddle.net/fTHYx/
[07:53:57] <grid_> hey
[07:55:09] <clewe> hello, is there a jquery equivelent to json_encode ?
[07:55:31] <Onions> jquery is an "addon" to js... why not use normal json_encode ?
[07:56:01] <clewe> so theres js function json_encode ?
[07:57:21] <Onions> erm
[07:57:31] <Onions> i thought there was
[07:58:44] <hurdos> Hello
[07:59:10] <clewe> hi
[07:59:11] <poim> why fadeIn but mouseenter?
[07:59:54] <hurdos> I think JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. So js should have native encode method for json
[08:01:01] <Anticom> however there is no native encoding method afaik
[08:01:09] <Anticom> but there a few nice plugins
[08:01:12] <Anticom> just google it
[08:01:51] <hurdos> why? eval() is native method for me
[08:29:38] <Fox`> why does outerHeight on an element of 45px + a top margin of 5 give me 47?
[08:30:13] <Fox`> oh border is 1px. so that's 47
[08:30:32] <Fox`> how do i return the height of the element + margins?
[08:31:34] <Fox`> ok ok ok i need to read the docs first
[08:37:23] <iaj> I got several p objects which are > 3 lines... Is there an easy way with jQuery to show 3 lines of those p, with a `More...' below, and if someone clicks that More... it's getting expanded?
[08:39:42] <rewt> you could make another div with just the short contents and show/hide them
[08:40:01] <Anticom> iaj i would to it by character count --> .lengh
[08:40:29] <Anticom> iaj if($('p').lengh > 500) { split into two spans, hide second and display "more..."link }
[08:40:58] <Anticom> sorry $('p').html().lengh
[08:41:17] <iaj> wow... the splitting into two spans, thats a bit of a task I guess
[08:41:23] <Anticom> is it?
[08:41:47] <iaj> for me, it is :)
[08:42:08] <Anticom> use native javascript .substring(from, to)
[08:42:09] <Anticom> ;)
[08:42:20] <Anticom> and then store it into temp-variables
[08:43:35] <iaj> hmmm that sounds even more difficult :D
[08:44:01] <Anticom> then simply $('p').empty().append('<span class='teaser'>' + tmp1 + '</span>').append('<span class='more'>' + tmp2 + '</span>').append('<span class="readMore">read more...</span>');
[08:47:14] <Anticom> can i use $('.selector').each(function() {..do stuff here with each object..});
[08:47:17] <Anticom> ?
[08:47:23] <Anticom> or wouldn't that work?
[08:50:00] <Segaja> Anticom: sounds right
[08:50:33] <Segaja> Anticom: in the internal function this will represent the current element
[08:53:59] <Anticom> iaj solution should be somewhat like that: http://jsfiddle.net/kU6JY/1/
[08:54:12] <Anticom> somehow it doesn't work right now, maybe the others can help debugging it
[08:54:56] <Anticom> could it be, that inside the each i've got to use this instead of $(this) ?
[08:56:12] <Anticom> i still think, that each was the wrong method :/
[09:05:24] <Anticom> iaj http://jsfiddle.net/kU6JY/2/ now only the .show() is buggy... got no time to inspect dom... there got to be some issue with that
[09:06:04] <Anticom> and it's got to be color instead of font-color in css ;)
[09:06:12] <iaj> Anticom; wooooooow, thanks man
[09:07:12] <Anticom> you're welcome
[09:07:35] <Anticom> you could extend that substring thing with while-loops to make sure, that you don't cut of the text in the middle of the word
[09:07:35] <iaj> that looks pretty interesting
[09:07:49] <iaj> I'll try to get the hang of it
[09:08:23] <Anticom> just copy it to a local file, so that you can inspect it better with firebug, then you'll figure out the dom navigation issue
[09:08:25] <Anticom> hf
[09:08:28] <Anticom> gotta go
[09:11:01] <iaj> thanx: ))
[09:11:05] <iaj> so nice!
[09:14:37] <beute> hey I need a little help if someone is available... i am trying to position an element with absolute, but it is showing up off by 1 px when viewing in different browsers.
[09:17:50] <Mazenwrq> hi
[09:17:56] <Mazenwrq> i have this example:
[09:17:58] <Mazenwrq> http://sixrevisions.com/tutorials/javascript_tutorial/create-a-slick-and-accessible-slideshow-using-jquery/
[09:17:59] <Mazenwrq> it's very good to me. but i want from it slid the Container after a moment.
[09:18:01] <Mazenwrq> how i can do it?
[09:20:36] <Mazenwrq> ?
[09:20:45] <Mazenwrq> help me please
[09:23:04] <Mazenwrq> no anyone
[09:24:23] <onykage> anyone know what would cause .submit(); not to work?
[09:28:25] <smplstk> onykage: a broken form ?
[09:33:36] <onykage> smplstk: no the form works fine if you click the button
[09:41:30] <donCams> hello
[09:41:34] <alex88> hi guys, a plugin that can give me this loading effect? http://photos.alexnetwork.it/photography/citta i have to change this because it reduces the line width everytime an image don't fit :/
[09:44:30] <donCams> sorry. i really suck at this. here it goes, if I have a var declaration inside a func var $parent = $('#parent_id'); would that get declared every time I call the function?
[09:44:53] <alex88> donCams: ofc, and you can't access it from outside
[09:45:02] <donCams> fuuu
[09:45:15] <alex88> ty :D
[09:45:37] <donCams> so there would be a chance of memory leak, right? :(
[09:46:13] <alex88> well, i've no idea if when the function is terminated the var is destroyed, but i think yes
[09:46:50] <onykage> question is to vague for me, can i see a pastie?
[09:47:34] <onykage> anyone know what would cause a form to refuse to be submitted with javascript but works fine if you click it?
[09:47:51] <donCams> i have a set of links that when clicked will activate the function
[09:47:56] <onykage> do you have to take away to actualy html submit or something?
[09:48:34] <donCams> so maybe I just have to unset the variables then
[09:48:38] <donCams> will that work?
[09:52:01] <alex88> donCams: if you are afraid of memory leaks you should
[09:53:01] <hariom> I want to create a simple login form that will validate the username/password using ajax. How this should be implemented? Modal window?
[09:53:18] <alex88> load() will work hooked to an image?
[09:53:48] <alex88> hariom: or just a div with some fadein/out hide/show or what yo want
[09:54:57] <hariom> alex88: yea that will be good too. Looking for light weight login form. I guess fadein/out would add better looks in terms of animation
[09:55:00] <donCams> i should what?
[09:55:47] <alex88> hariom: and make that perfect using also a full page black div for focus onto the login form, there are pre-done plugins for that
[09:55:54] <alex88> like jquerytools if i'm not wrong
[09:56:44] <hariom> alex88: I don't want to add another plugin. That would be a network overhead. Login is very small part of the entire site.
[09:57:13] <onykage> anyone ever seen this?
[09:57:14] <onykage> document.getElementById("settingsform").submit is not a function		document.getElementById("settingsform").submit();
[10:03:35] <Gorkyman> hey guys... I have some json data comming from ajax call... how can I decode json back to some object or array ?
[10:07:05] <Gorkyman> got it
[10:10:25] <knubbze-> Hi, is it allowed to ask questions regarding technologies that use jquery here? I am using nivoslider and I can't get it to actually slide through the pictures
[10:11:46] <knubbze-> it is always displaying the picture that I specify in startSlide, but it won't actually start sliding :(
[10:13:27] <knubbze-> oh, js console says `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'substr' of undefined' I think I might have a look at what it is trying to substr
[10:13:40] <KingTarquin> I'm doing an AJAX request from within jquery UI tabs, should all the stylesheets and javascript files from the document which performed the AJAX request be relevant in the document which responded to the AJAX?
[10:15:20] <knubbze-> fixed it myself, sorry for bothering y'all :)
[10:16:16] <qin> Hi there, can someone point me to explanation of (class="nav101 nav102"): var className = $(this).attr('class'), midNum = /\bnav(\S+)/.exec(className)[1], selector = '.nav' + midNum; The "/\bnav(\S+)/", what regrep is it?

[10:20:29] <cbdg> hi, having trouble getting images returned with auto complete
[10:22:11] <eddiemonge> cbdg: what do you mean images returned? are you sending the images as data or a string to their location?
[10:23:17] <cbdg> got basic jquery ui autocomplete working
[10:23:33] <cbdg> but using this function its not: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/930159/jquery-autocomplete-images-with-options
[10:24:09] <cbdg> with this php script:
[10:24:14] <cbdg> <spam>
[10:24:17] <cbdg> while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($query, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {                 $row_array['id'] = $row['tId'];                 $row_array['value'] = $row['topic'];                 array_push($return_arr,$row_array);             } }         /* Free connection resources. */         mysql_close($connect);         /* Toss back results as json encoded array. */         echo json_encode($return_arr);
[10:24:23] <cbdg> </spam>
[10:24:43] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ cbdg
[10:24:44] <bot-t> cbdg, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[10:25:06] <cbdg> sorry
[10:25:33] <eddiemonge> and you should be using the mysqli extension in case php really does kill off the mysql stuff
[10:27:11] <eddiemonge> {  $array[] = array( 'id'=>$row['id'], 'value'=>$row['topic']);  }  echo json_encode($array)
[10:27:25] <eddiemonge> no need for the extra array_push
[10:28:29] <ajpiano> cbdg: the jQuery UI autocomplete and the bassistance autocomplete in that demo have different APIs
[10:28:43] <ajpiano> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data should show you have to present custom data with the jQuery UI autocomplete
[10:30:05] <pr0ton> !autocomplete
[10:30:15] <pr0ton> ?autocomplete
[10:30:15] <bot-t> jQuery UI - Autocomplete Demos & Documentation - The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. Here the suggestions are tags for programming languages, give "ja" (for Java or JavaScript) a try. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[10:33:17] <cbdg> what would be good is getting the source for images.php here http://view.jquery.com/trunk/plugins/autocomplete/demo/
[10:34:36] <eddiemonge> why? the source for that doesnt matter. all you need is a page that returns valid json with the correct data
[10:37:47] <cbdg> eddiemonge: ok, will work with what you gave me so far, thanks
[10:39:36] <Engin> any super kick ass solution for multiple image uploading ?

[10:40:12] <ghufran> hi. i am trying to hide all the div elements which have a certain class but i can't seem to get it to work. I'm doing $("#client_create_form .msg-info")[0].hide() . But i get Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'hide'
[10:41:05] <ajpiano> ghufran, you only want to hide the first one ?
[10:41:23] <ajpiano> hide is a jQuery method, you can't call it on a DOM element, which is what you're getting back when you do [0]
[10:41:46] <ghufran> ajpiano, no. i want to hide them all. tried using .each after the selector (which didn't work either) so i decided to check on the first one
[10:41:53] <ajpiano> just do
[10:42:03] <ajpiano> g $("#client_create_form .msg-info").hide();
[10:42:57] <KingTarquin> I'm using tr:odd on a class which is in a table requested by AJAX from jQuery UI Tabs, but it doesn't appear to be adding the class to it.
[10:43:01] <ghufran> oh! thanks ajpiano .. so when to use each and when not to use it?
[10:43:22] <ajpiano> ghufran: most jQuery methods implicity iterate over the entire set of elements
[10:43:33] <ajpiano> .each() is when you need to do some arbitrary logic to each element
[10:44:31] <ghufran> ajpiano, i also tried changing the css using .css('display', 'none') which said css is not a method :S
[10:44:42] <ajpiano> that's cause you can't call jQuery methods on DOM elements
[10:45:28] <Engin> ajpiano, thank you buddy
[10:50:10] <Engin> ajpiano, couldn't see it on examples, it looks like they don't support displaying thumbnails before uploading ?
[10:50:22] <ajpiano> dunno, haven't used it
[10:50:46] <Engin> :D
[10:58:03] <posplaw> Hello everyone. I checked out some drag-and-drop plugins for uploading files. But each one starts uploading right after the dropping file. I would have the one that only changes standard input file button, letting user to upload image only at submitting form.

[11:14:58] <eddiemonge> oops meant that for grid_
[11:15:21] <eddiemonge> xsamurai: ids should start with letters
[11:15:59] <eddiemonge> xsamurai: and why arent you using .val()?
[11:16:02] <xsamurai> eddiemonge: it shouldnt be a cause for it to not work though
[11:16:07] <xsamurai> i tried val() it didnt work
[11:16:07] <grid_> hey eddiemonge
[11:16:12] <xsamurai> i get undefined in my code

[11:16:37] <eddiemonge> xsamurai: got a live link?
[11:16:56] <grid_> eddiemonge: i never tried your suggestion, i google it, besides i try it, do you think you can help me?
[11:17:20] <eddiemonge> grid_: ok. there are a lot of plugins but not all of them are good. jquery ui's dialogs are really nice and work
[11:18:10] <posplaw> so no suggestions for my problem?
[11:18:22] <eddiemonge> xsamurai: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-id
[11:18:34] <xsamurai> eddiemonge: unfortunately nope, but i think this is due to the fact that in my code the selects are dynamically being added
[11:19:07] <eddiemonge> posplaw: so you want to be able to drag images into a form but only have them upload when the form is submitted?
[11:19:15] <grid_> eddiemonge: can you drag it? i think i found the project page, i havent not seen i could drag it yet
[11:19:45] <posplaw> eddiemonge: right, just modifying somehow input file button to drop file here, not choosing it from the pc
[11:19:50] <eddiemonge> xsamurai: like i said, ids have to start with letters
[11:19:59] <eddiemonge> grid_: yes you can. see ? dialog
[11:20:01] <bot-t> grid_, UI/API/1.8/Dialog - Overview Options Events Methods Theming jQuery UI Dialog Overview A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
[11:20:01] <xsamurai> k let me give it a try
[11:27:51] <grid_> eddiemonge: i found this one: http://example.nemikor.com/basic-usage-of-the-jquery-ui-dialog/ looks ok
[11:28:42] <eddiemonge> grid_: why dont you just look on jqueryui.com?
[11:30:51] <eddiemonge> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[11:31:23] <grid_> eddiemonge: that one that i gave has no background fade
[11:31:29] <Soopaman> is there any way to write a handler that triggers on patterns typed into a text input field?
[11:31:44] <grid_> that page i have opened right now, it has no background fade options included i think
[11:32:30] <grid_> eddiemonge: modal form has one :)
[11:33:22] <callumacrae> How can I check whether a selector matches an element I have?
[11:34:33] <eddiemonge> $('selector').length
[11:34:48] <posplaw> eddiemonge: no ideas?
[11:35:22] <eddiemonge> posplaw: nope sorry. might have to look into a flash solution for maybe how someone else does it like facebook
[11:36:43] <grid_> eddiemonge: do you think you can adjust the model overlay screen? i see now lines that will move on the screen: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal
[11:37:05] <sean``> posplaw, look at plupload
[11:37:20] <grid_> diagonal lines
[11:48:06] <alexk> what's the best way to modify a css attribute so that elements which will be appended later will apply the style of the modified class?
[11:48:49] <sean``> alex88, $('<style>.class { prop: val; }</style>').appendTo ('head')
[11:49:41] <alexk> sean``: that's an interesting approach... thank you
[11:56:52] <alex88> sean``: damn, i was thinking someone replied my question :D
[11:57:24] <sean``> soz alex88 :p
[11:58:47] <alex88> is there and image onload fade-in plugin?
[11:59:45] <sean``> that's really easy to do
[12:00:04] <alex88> i've tried using load() or ready() but it doesn't fire on cached images
[12:00:12] <sean``> there are also treshhold plugsin, that fade the image in when they come into your view area
[12:00:18] <Engin> this plupload keeps the upload and form post very much separate
[12:00:31] <Engin> and i don't see a way to get a unique identifier for the whole upload process
[12:00:38] <Engin> so i can bind it to the form data later on at least
[12:00:45] <sean``> ?preloading
[12:00:46] <bot-t> Simple Preloading: $("<img/>").load(function(){}).attr("src",newsrc) <--- Note that you bind the load callback before changing the image src.

[12:01:26] <alex88> sean``: oh tons of stuff..let me organize it :)
[12:06:44] <grid_> eddiemonge: i dont want to use a big api on my page
[12:07:01] <grid_> instead i just want a good modal draggable dialog
[12:08:34] <Dagoat> Hi... I've got two problems with UI .dialogs and Validate.. anyone give me a hand?  http://jsfiddle.net/c6YEx/1/
[12:09:37] <Dagoat> The 2nd dialog thinks it's part of the 1st one. I've read a ton of articles and questions about it, but I can't seem to get it straight
[12:10:10] <grid_> i'm working with jquery popup, that is freeware, i want to use my popup in the middle of my page, i want it to be opened in the center of my page within modal mode, i could do this already, but i have to press the center button after i open it in modal mode, i want to open it with 1 click in the center in modal mode, can someone help me? here is my popup http://grid.heliohost.org/index-jQuery1.4.html
[12:10:59] <alex88> sean``: imagesLoaded fires when all images are loaded, not only ones inside the selector..
[12:16:17] <ajpiano> grid_ $("#sampleformdiv").jqpopup_open(this.id).jqpopup_toCenter();
[12:16:24] <ajpiano> put that in the handler that you want to do both
[12:16:28] <ajpiano> grid_: also i must say
[12:16:35] <ajpiano> that has to be one of the shittest jQuey plugins i've ever seen
[12:17:14] <ajpiano> the API is godawful, it violates all sorts of plugin organisation, API, and performance best practises
[12:20:20] <grid_> ajpiano: i just deal with it because i want to bring my website online, after that, i will choose another popup
[12:20:47] <grid_> ajpiano: i will try to replace the handler with your code, have you tried it? did it work?
[12:20:56] <ajpiano> yes, it should work just fine
[12:26:14] <Dagoat> Updated my fiddle, I forgot the button handlers. If anyone could check this out I'd appreciate it
[12:26:16] <Dagoat> $("#registerShow")
[12:26:16] <Dagoat> .button()
[12:26:16] <Dagoat>             .click(function() {
[12:26:16] <Dagoat>                 $('#registerPop').dialog("open");
[12:26:16] <Dagoat>                 });
[12:26:16] <Dagoat> $("#loginShow")
[12:26:16] <Dagoat> .button()
[12:26:17] <Dagoat>             .click(function() {
[12:26:17] <Dagoat>                 $('#loginPop').dialog("open");
[12:26:18] <Dagoat>                 });
[12:26:18] <Dagoat> });
[12:26:19] <Dagoat> shit
[12:26:20] <Dagoat> sorry
[12:26:31] <Dagoat> http://jsfiddle.net/c6YEx/2/
[12:26:37] <grid_> ajpiano: ok, well, i tried to replace $("#sampleformdiv").jqpopup_open(this.id,true); with your given code but it didnt do anything
[12:26:59] <grid_> that handler will open the modal popup the normal way without center
[12:32:00] <grid_> ajpiano: i think we are very close, can you give it another try? atleast it will center with 1 click, it must also bring it to the sceen in modal mode
[12:32:32] <ajpiano> bro
[12:32:44] <ajpiano> there's a jqpopup_toCenter() method
[12:32:52] <ajpiano> clearly you have to call it on the same element
[12:33:06] <ajpiano> at some point during the handler
[12:33:08] <ajpiano> experiment with it some
[12:33:12] <ajpiano> i got it to work on the console
[12:33:14] <ajpiano> but now i am leaving the house
[12:33:15] <ajpiano> sorry
[12:34:03] <grid_> i got it to work anyways
[12:34:04] <grid_> thanks
[12:34:15] <grid_> oh you are going, see you :)

[13:00:29] <djQuery> sykopomp: try focusing something first
[13:01:35] <sykopomp> djQuery: I tried doing document.body.focus(), $("selectsomething").get(0).focus(), etc.
[13:01:41] <sykopomp> no go -- I have to click first.

[13:03:08] <Dagoat> I have a problem with two dialogs on the same page, can anyone give me a hand? I also have a validate problem, but it's subordinate to the other.  http://jsfiddle.net/c6YEx/2/
[13:03:38] <Dagoat> I've tried about 15 different suggestions from various sites for dealing with it
[13:07:04] <sykopomp> hmm, actually. http://jsfiddle.net/TrAx8/ even this basic one doesn't really do what I'd like.
[13:07:48] <sykopomp> (I'm not sure a jsfiddle will be much help in my case...)

[13:10:51] <ElCapitanMarklar> hey i have a list that I am dynamically adding li items to but my changes arent showing up when running on a server, works fine localhost
[13:11:04] <ElCapitanMarklar> i have tried doing $('list').listview('refresh') but that gives me the error Uncaught cannot call methods on listview prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[13:11:16] <ElCapitanMarklar> when i inspect the ul code in the page it has the updated html with the added items but they just dont display
[13:11:22] <Soopaman> sykopomp: possibly by .setfocus to the page?
[13:11:57] <sykopomp> Soopaman: on the document, or the window?
[13:12:04] <ElCapitanMarklar> and i am running the listview('refresh') after the page has loaded too. well after
[13:12:19] <Soopaman> any ideas on pattern matching based on characters relative to the cursor within a input/textarea?
[13:12:43] <sykopomp> Soopaman: not to mention, there doesn't seem to be a .setfocus.
[13:12:44] <Soopaman> syko, try either
[13:13:00] <sykopomp> there's a .focus(), but I've already tried document.body.focus(). No go on that one.
[13:13:32] <bjhaid> hi I get a certain GET request hitting my server in the backend, and I want to use polling to display it in the front-end to a particular  client with an id included in the backend, any suggestions on how to actualize this?
[13:14:24] <CodaBrink> Hello, I'm using the animate method on a div, and I want to move it to the left just off of the screen and no further. Is there a way I can evaluate something like "left: '-=$(this).position().left+$(this).width()'"?
[13:15:34] <CodaBrink> Basically, is there a way to evaluate a variable into that string? Or do I need to go the long way with concatenating strings?
[13:17:14] <djQuery> CodaBrink: see ?ui.position
[13:17:14] <bot-t> CodaBrink, Utility script for positioning any widget relative to the window, document, a particular element, or the cursor/mouse. Does not need ui.core.js or effects.core.js. http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[13:17:35] <DannyZB> don't use that thing
[13:17:36] <DannyZB> it
[13:17:40] <DannyZB> it's awful
[13:17:46] <djQuery> CodaBrink: course you will need turn of the flip
[13:18:07] <DannyZB> I tried it and it kept having bizzare behaviours
[13:18:15] <DannyZB> it handles complex page templates poorly
[13:18:28] <djQuery> DannyZB: so you didnt use it right so it must suck?
[13:19:48] <systemfault> djQuery: That's the way it works :P I always blame the tools instead of admitting my incompetence :P
[13:20:51] <djQuery> DannyZB: what is the bug # that u submitted?
[13:25:00] <bjhaid> please is there anyway I can get to pull some GET request sent to my server by a soap application to display on a client's web interface
[13:29:31] <sykopomp> fwiw: http://jsfiddle.net/TrAx8/4/ still exhibits the behavior I'm talking about. Maybe there's something I'm not getting about browsers?...
[13:29:48] <alex88> sean`: only working method was to use <img onload= thing
[13:32:14] <d4rklit3>  djQuery, window.open sets off the pop up blocker
[13:32:22] <d4rklit3> i just want to make a <a> link and then click it on w/ js
[13:33:44] <djQuery> well the same reason that there are popup blockers for that is probably the same reason it wont work to trigger a click on a <a> to make it seem like the user clicked it
[13:37:18] <DannyZB> finally ! chatzilla
[13:37:38] <sykopomp> issue resolved: funky fx plugin is to blame. All is right in the world.
[13:39:49] <DannyZB> whos having trouble with jQuery?
[13:49:10] <molavy> hi
[13:53:26] <molavy> hi
[13:54:27] <molavy> is there any one?
[13:58:21] <florsignol> hi, i'm having touble using $('[href|="#"]') to select any elements
[13:58:58] <KingDosser> florsignol: Try putting a * before the [href]
[13:59:28] <KingDosser> florsignol: You are trying to select all elements that have a href starting with # right ?
[13:59:41] <florsignol> that's right
[14:00:05] <KingDosser> Did that work for you?
[14:00:10] <florsignol> although i have a few in the document, it doesn't seem to select any
[14:00:56] <KingDosser> florsignol: Try: $('*[href^="#"]');
[14:01:03] <florsignol> however using [href*="#"]
[14:01:07] <florsignol> selects them all
[14:01:27] <KingDosser> The one I just posted should select any that start with a #
[14:03:39] <florsignol> KingDosser: thanks, it seems to work
[14:03:49] <KingDosser> florsignol : No worries :)
[14:04:27] <DannyZB> !!
[14:04:52] <djQuery> florsignol: and $('a').find(''[href*="#"]')    would work a lot faster
[14:05:06] <djQuery> well if the qoutes were right in it
[14:05:36] <DannyZB> isnt it $('a').find("[href*=#]') ?
[14:07:13] <djQuery> nope its $('a').find('[href^="#"]')
[14:07:36] <DannyZB> what does it need to do?
[14:07:46] <djQuery> starts with #
[14:07:52] <DannyZB> oh right
[14:13:05] <Assimilater> hey, i've been having this problem with making buttons sortable: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/sortable-buttons and i'm thinking i need to rethink my gui design. I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas? (in practice usage example (truncated): http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/vBZ6C/)
[14:13:42] <Assimilater> the goal is to allow the user to determine the sorting order and direction (asc desc)

[14:17:15] <r0binn> hi
[14:17:43] <r0binn> somebody knows how can I have 3 different forms using SWFUPLOAD in the same page?
[14:18:01] <r0binn> 0 information in internet
[14:19:07] <DannyZB> ask on the forum there
[14:19:15] <florsignol> CodaBrink: are you trying to change the positon of these elements?
[14:19:17] <DannyZB> plugin questions rarely get answered here
[14:19:22] <r0binn> this is the code
[14:19:24] <r0binn> http://www.pastie.org/2228417
[14:19:29] <CodaBrink> florsignol: Yes, fetch and change.
[14:19:42] <florsignol> make sure that the .position() method is on a jQuery object
[14:19:51] <CodaBrink> florsignol: I'm changing the position through the animate method.
[14:20:04] <CodaBrink> florsignol: How do I convert cloud to a jQuery object?
[14:20:36] <DannyZB> Try sorrounding cloud with a jquery function
[14:20:40] <DannyZB> ie $(cloud)
[14:20:45] <CodaBrink> ahh
[14:20:49] <florsignol> did you try .each()
[14:20:59] <DannyZB> he's already using it
[14:21:25] <r0binn> sorry, that's it ! http://showusyoursnips.com/samuel-r-w-east/forms/uploads/amazon-s3-swf-upload-multiple-files
[14:21:28] <florsignol> within .each() make sure you use $(element).position() ...
[14:21:45] <r0binn> how can I use that for multiple forms? there are several options using asking for id's, i need classes
[14:21:45] <DannyZB> r0binn : how good is swfupload?
[14:21:47] <CodaBrink> Awesome, that worked.
[14:21:49] <CodaBrink> Thank you
[14:21:54] <DannyZB> I'm using plupload and it has multiple issues
[14:22:05] <r0binn> DannyZB: it works nice
[14:22:12] <r0binn> but I have several forms in the same page
[14:22:14] <florsignol> CodaBrink: you're welcome
[14:22:15] <DannyZB> handles chunked uploads well?
[14:22:23] <r0binn> and i don't know how to use it for multiple forms
[14:22:32] <DannyZB> whats the problem ?
[14:22:41] <DannyZB> usually plugins just take an id
[14:23:15] <r0binn> ok but i need 3 different forms, select these 3 files in each form, push a single button and launch the uploads directly to amazon
[14:23:17] <r0binn> you understand?
[14:25:22] <DannyZB> yes
[14:25:33] <DannyZB> iwll check
[14:25:41] <r0binn> ok thank you VERY MUCH
[14:27:52] <DannyZB> is swfupload capable of multiple file uploads?
[14:28:45] <DannyZB> and if it is why are you splitting it into multiple forms
[14:29:37] <`teh1> hey
[14:29:43] <r0binn> because I need to set different parameters for each one
[14:29:46] <`teh1> let's say i have a ul with 5 li's inside
[14:29:57] <`teh1> let's say the 3rd li is a class of "sel"
[14:30:11] <DannyZB> what you basically need
[14:30:14] <`teh1> is there a selector to get everything before that li, and is there one to get everything after?
[14:30:18] <r0binn> for example, first form is a video (mp4), and should be called: <user>_<event_id>_video_preview
[14:30:22] <r0binn> you understand?
[14:30:28] <DannyZB> let me see if I got this right
[14:30:34] <DannyZB> you have say .. 3 uploader objects
[14:30:38] <DannyZB> which are seperate from eachother
[14:30:41] <r0binn> yes
[14:30:52] <DannyZB> and what you need is a javascript callback which calls the 3 of them>?
[14:31:26] <`teh1> is there a way to select every sibling element before a certain one, and a different way to select everything after?
[14:31:27] <r0binn> I have 3 forms, I need to create 3 SWFUpload instances (different post params for each one)
[14:31:39] <r0binn> And a single button which begin the uploads
[14:31:47] <r0binn> so, each form has its own progress bar
[14:32:02] <DannyZB> so whats the problem?
[14:32:09] <r0binn> I don't know how to do it :\
[14:32:19] <DannyZB> have the button click the 3 upload buttons
[14:32:40] <DannyZB> SWFUpload.instances -> it's obvious SWFUpload was designed to handle this
[14:32:54] <r0binn> DannyZB: in the source code
[14:33:01] <r0binn> it's not ready to multiple forms
[14:33:16] <r0binn> some attributes are calling for ids, instead classes
[14:33:32] <DannyZB> show me the code
[14:33:34] <r0binn> button_placeholder_id: "spanButtonPlaceHolder",

[14:34:39] <DannyZB> ...
[14:34:53] <r0binn> and this line: swfu = new SWFUpload(settings);
[14:34:53] <r0binn>  ?
[14:35:06] <r0binn> mmmmmmmmm
[14:35:08] <r0binn> let me see
[14:35:28] <DannyZB> it sounds like you're just confusing yourself to me
[14:35:34] <DannyZB> it's quite trivial
[14:35:43] <pr0ton> is there any way i can save my jquery ui themes online?
[14:35:46] <pr0ton> in case i wanna change it?
[14:35:54] <r0binn> DannyZB: these link is just what I need
[14:35:57] <DannyZB> pr0ton : themeroller
[14:36:08] <r0binn> the only difference is that I need a single button to upload the 3 files
[14:36:15] <DannyZB> r0binn: It's the first google result for "SWFUpload multiple instances" lol
[14:36:37] <r0binn> ok I was looking for SWFUpload multiple uploads :D
[14:36:44] <pr0ton> DannyZB, i can save them online?
[14:36:47] <pr0ton> and edit later?
[14:36:53] <pr0ton> so far i could only create and then download it
[14:36:54] <DannyZB> ofcourse you can
[14:37:01] <Assimilater> any ideas anyone? ^^
[14:37:04] <DannyZB> themes are always stored online
[14:37:11] <DannyZB> the moment you edit the css and image files they change
[14:37:11] <pr0ton> how do i do that?
[14:37:20] <DannyZB> you know how to use themes right?
[14:37:25] <pr0ton> yeah
[14:37:26] <pr0ton> i meant this
[14:37:29] <pr0ton> i created a theme now
[14:37:34] <pr0ton> and i've entered all settings online
[14:37:39] <DannyZB> nonononono you missed my point
[14:37:44] <pr0ton> now i want to load this theme next timei visit the page
[14:37:49] <DannyZB> that online thing is just some dumb toy
[14:37:53] <pr0ton> i dont want to set all values again
[14:38:01] <DannyZB> the themes it creates are simple image and css files
[14:38:07] <DannyZB> just edit them
[14:38:07] <pr0ton> yeah i know that
[14:38:10] <pr0ton> ok
[14:38:18] <pr0ton> but the tool is useful
[14:38:22] <pr0ton> since i can see how it looks realitme
[14:38:42] <DannyZB> personally I mostly avoid jQuery themes
[14:38:50] <DannyZB> most sites have absolutely no need for them
[14:38:54] <`teh1> agreed
[14:39:03] <Assimilater> pr0ton: when you edit the theme it stores all data in GET so you can bookmark the page
[14:39:15] <pr0ton> Assimilater, thanks!
[14:39:33] <DannyZB> woah >< totally got you wrong there my bad
[14:40:36] <Assimilater> any ideas anyone? ^^ (am i going to have to repost the question? :P )
[14:41:00] <DannyZB> if the questions is "any ideas anyone?"
[14:41:07] <DannyZB> then you don't need to repost it
[14:41:09] <Assimilater> it's not
[14:41:13] <Assimilater> it's back like 40 minutes ago
[14:41:30] <Assimilater> hey, i've been having this problem with making buttons sortable: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/sortable-buttons and i'm thinking i need to rethink my gui design. I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas? (in practice usage example (truncated): http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/vBZ6C/) the goal is to allow the user to determine sorting order and direction
[14:42:50] <DannyZB> what problem are you running into with sorting buttons ?
[14:43:08] <Assimilater> well using input[type="button"] or button will not work with sortable
[14:43:12] <Assimilater> see the first link in the forum post
[14:43:32] <Assimilater> so i went about doing $(a_span).button() and had spacing/highlighting issues
[14:44:25] <Assimilater> i'm wondering if there would be a better approach than using ui buttons that might solve the highlighting/spacing issues i'm facing
[14:44:31] <Assimilater> and still 'look nice' to the user
[14:44:46] <dwarder> does this mean an element that has class "rad" and its name attribute equals to "month": $("[name=month] .rad")   ?
[14:45:28] <Assimilater> dwarder: i don't think so the space indicates .rad is inside the element with attr('name') == 'month'
[14:45:45] <Assimilater> dwarder: try $('.rad[name]"month"')
[14:45:49] <Assimilater> oops
[14:45:49] <Assimilater> nvm
[14:45:56] <Assimilater> dwarder: try $('.rad[name="month"]')
[14:46:05] <Assimilater> sleepy fingers :P
[14:46:12] <DannyZB> assimilater : nothing works there for me
[14:46:14] <dwarder> i see, thanks :)
[14:46:19] <DannyZB> all the layout is messed up in firefox 4
[14:46:31] <DannyZB> can you state what you are trying to do with words?
[14:46:34] <Assimilater> DannyZB: the point is that buttons can not be dragged with sortable (in the first link)
[14:46:45] <DannyZB> Assimilater : sounds like a bad idea
[14:46:52] <DannyZB> too much freedom is bad for the common user
[14:46:59] <DannyZB> a button needs to stay where it is
[14:47:11] <Assimilater> that's what i was wondering
[14:47:23] <Assimilater> what would be better
[14:47:27] <DannyZB> notice how most software handles flexible layouts
[14:47:36] <DannyZB> place buttons in groups on draggable panels
[14:47:46] <DannyZB> if you're so keen on doing it
[14:47:51] <Assimilater> i need to let the user say "sort by total first, then by name" or "sort by name" and "high to low numbers" or "z to a"
[14:48:05] <Assimilater> so i'm wondering what might be a more sensible gui
[14:48:30] <DannyZB> I barely got what you were trying to do there
[14:48:36] <DannyZB> it's all over the place
[14:48:42] <Assimilater> ya....
[14:48:50] <ejo> Got a $.getScript() question here... if I use getScript to load and execute some javascript, I guess the script that is loaded doesn't end up in the DOM, so how would I debug it with Firebug or other tools?  Is there a way to load script into the DOM and then execute it so that debugging is possible?
[14:49:21] <DannyZB> ejo
[14:49:23] <Assimilater> basically there are many ways i need to allow the user to short the list generated (with ajax)
[14:49:23] <DannyZB> yes there is
[14:49:46] <DannyZB> jQuery('<script/>').attr('src', url).attr('id','lang_'+LangMap[i][i2]).appendTo('head');
[14:49:54] <DannyZB> a snippet from my code
[14:50:01] <DannyZB> replace "lang_ blah blah blah
[14:50:04] <DannyZB> with your script
[14:50:24] <DannyZB> nono one sec heh
[14:50:26] <DannyZB> 	jQuery('<script/>').attr('src', url)
[14:50:31] <ejo> I know I can just load some script into the DOM like that. sure.  But how would it ever be read by the javascript interpreter?
[14:50:38] <DannyZB> yes it would
[14:50:42] <ejo> unless I exec it?
[14:50:50] <DannyZB> oh
[14:50:56] <DannyZB> of course you should execute it
[14:50:57] <d4rklit3> is there a way to grant focus on an object on the page (a swf)
[14:51:19] <ejo> cool, thanks. Yes, it's just some function definitions which i then need to make use of afterward (using a success callback, of course).
[14:51:31] <DannyZB> d4rklit3 > give it a tabindex and use .focus()
[14:51:40] <DannyZB> not sure it would work but it's worth a shot
[14:52:02] <ejo> So, final question: am I right that $.getScript() does not place your script in the DOM anywhere, and doesn't have an option to do so?
[14:52:27] <DannyZB> ejo : I have no clue tried to use it and it just kept having all sorts of errors
[14:52:46] <ejo> (just because its syntax is nice and clean, would be nice to use as shorthand)... happy to use $.ajax and callbacks or your method otherwise.  No prob
[14:52:55] <ejo> ok, thx again.
[14:54:39] <Assimilater> DannyZB: do you have a suggestion that doesn't involve buttons?
[14:54:58] <DannyZB> what is the page about?
[14:55:03] <DannyZB> whats the content?
[14:55:12] <Assimilater> well i gave some sample content...
[14:55:26] <Assimilater> the content is a list of contacts the user has created on the site
[14:55:31] <Assimilater> this page is about displaying all info about them
[14:55:45] <Assimilater> that dark gery box that says "John Call" is one of hopefully hundreds
[14:55:57] <Assimilater> i want the user to be able to say what the sorting order is
[14:56:22] <Assimilater> ie show the list in order of last name DESC THEN Quality Total ASC
[14:56:25] <Assimilater> or the opposite
[14:56:39] <DannyZB> http://tablesorter.com/docs/
[14:57:05] <DannyZB> it's a table plugin
[14:57:06] <Assimilater> you see problem with that, the inner contents of each contact
[14:57:11] <Assimilater> requires that i not use tables
[14:57:16] <Assimilater> the markup would be horrendous
[14:57:16] <DannyZB> why not?
[14:57:22] <Assimilater> click  on view
[14:57:28] <Assimilater> and notice the kind of stuff that's in there
[14:58:06] <DannyZB> seriously I'm getting a headache just trying to follow that markup
[14:58:12] <DannyZB> just tell me whats the issue
[14:58:19] <Assimilater> well i am not using tables
[14:58:22] <DannyZB> sound exactly like the kind of data I would put in a table
[14:58:31] <Assimilater> well there's mroe data than name phone email etc
[14:58:37] <Assimilater> with each contact there are *multiple* notes
[14:58:42] <Assimilater> *multiple* reports
[14:58:47] <Assimilater> *multiple* follow up reminders
[14:58:54] <DannyZB> just a thought
[14:59:03] <DannyZB> why not use a more advanced ajax menu?
[14:59:03] <Assimilater> and *multiple* other things that the user executes from this page
[14:59:12] <DannyZB> What I would do:
[14:59:13] <Assimilater> well that's what i'm trying to create
[14:59:21] <DannyZB> Organize the basic data in a table
[14:59:28] <DannyZB> and use slide-out menus for the rest
[14:59:42] <DannyZB> or dynamically add rows with sliding data
[15:00:01] <DannyZB> ie a row with one cell below the user thats created with jQuery once a user is clicked
[15:00:03] <Owner_> I keep getting a json parse error for my json ajax replies, even though i set the Content-Type to application/json
[15:00:30] <DannyZB> below a contact *
[15:00:55] <DannyZB> you don't want to overload the user with data , most of it should be hidden until requested no?
[15:01:01] <Assimilater> right
[15:01:05] <Owner_> Do I need to wrap the json in parens?
[15:01:14] <Techdeck> if I .cancel() an ajax request, is there a way to know the "error" is abort and not anything else?
[15:01:29] <DannyZB> owner > json data is usually created with built-in functions what are you trying to do?
[15:02:06] <Owner_> DannyZB: return json when an ajax request is made
[15:02:09] <Assimilater> idk every time i try and think of a solution with tables, it gets sticky (especially since i would prefer the data be displayed the way it is, i already have my php script written to allow for the sorting order to be changed, provided i can come up with an interface for the user to do just that)
[15:02:21] <Owner_> DannyZB: firebug has no problem parsing the returned json
[15:04:15] <DannyZB> are you using jQuery.getJSON ?
[15:04:34] <DannyZB> assimilater :
[15:04:41] <DannyZB> from experience with the app I just built
[15:04:48] <DannyZB> it's simpler to just use JSON
[15:04:55] <DannyZB> then you can change the design as much as you please
[15:05:15] <DannyZB> or very basic ajax-returned markup without any styling
[15:06:50] <DannyZB> anyway how I would organize it : in a table, with basic data , and with rows with links for any advanced data
[15:06:54] <Assimilater> DannyZB: i'm not sure if you're takling to me or owner about JSON (never heard of it)
[15:07:02] <DannyZB> you 2
[15:07:16] <DannyZB> JSON is a protocol for inter-language communication
[15:07:22] <DannyZB> ie between PHP and JAVASCRIPT
[15:07:34] <DannyZB> you pass an array directly and javascript parses it as an array
[15:08:30] <DannyZB> the best thing about it is you can do cross-domain requests
[15:08:57] <Assimilater> eh
[15:08:58] <Owner_> I think I just needed double quotes around my object keys. :|
[15:09:18] <Assimilater> this just seems like more work than it's worth getting into this stuff...idk
[15:09:23] <Owner_> DannyZB: cross-domain request is just a req to another server?
[15:09:51] <DannyZB> owner_ : a different domain , sometimes several servers have the same domain
[15:10:05] <Owner_> ok
[15:10:44] <Assimilater> DannyZB: also be aware that the makrup in my fiddle is a copy paste from firebug (ie after javascript code has executed) it's not exactly what is coming back from php
[15:11:14] <DannyZB> I don't know what it is but it's a mess
[15:11:42] <DannyZB> anyway I told you what I think , whatever you do later remember who the user is
[15:12:50] <DannyZB> guys , I need opinions on a welcome page
[15:12:58] <DannyZB> apps.facebook.com/diskonline
[15:13:06] <DannyZB> http://apps.facebook.com/diskonline
[15:20:11] <franksoncharles> hello everyone
[15:20:56] <DannyZB> evening
[15:21:08] <franksoncharles> I'm having an issue with $.get(), would anyone here happen to be intimately familiar with it?
[15:21:33] <DannyZB> whats the issue
[15:22:21] <franksoncharles> I'm declaring a variable at the start of my script, then within the callback function of the $.get that variable is given a value
[15:22:26] <Phelms215> Hey guys http://jsfiddle.net/2SvGS/ can someone take a look at this function
[15:22:35] <Phelms215> I am trying to call a blur inside of a blur and its not working
[15:22:36] <Phelms215> :(
[15:22:37] <franksoncharles> but if I call the variable anywhere outside the callback function it is undefined
[15:23:04] <DannyZB> thats javascript not jquery
[15:23:11] <DannyZB> the variable is in the scope of the callback
[15:23:19] <DannyZB> declare it before you call $.GET
[15:23:22] <franksoncharles> I did
[15:23:22] <bjhaid> Hi, please is there anyway I can get notified with jquery when a get request hits my backend server?
[15:23:37] <franksoncharles> I declared it first thing, its a global variable
[15:23:48] <DannyZB> well you did something else wrong
[15:23:56] <DannyZB> variables don't magically get undefined
[15:24:06] <Phelms215> franksoncharles I believe in the function you need to declare it as a global var
[15:24:10] <Phelms215> if you dont its only for that function
[15:24:18] <Phelms215> and u now have 2 versions of the same function
[15:24:25] <Phelms215> I bet if you did alert(variable);
[15:24:31] <Phelms215> you would get the pre function value
[15:24:55] <DannyZB> phelms215: when did he say he declared it twice?
[15:26:44] <Phelms215> he said he did at the start of the script, then in the function
[15:27:06] <franksoncharles> so just to test
[15:27:26] <Phelms215> how are you declaring the var outside of the function
[15:27:30] <franksoncharles> at the top of my script I have var frank = "test";
[15:27:32] <Phelms215> did you do window.varName ?
[15:27:36] <DannyZB> frank , phelms is right , show us the source
[15:27:45] <Phelms215> do window.varName to global the variable inside the function
[15:28:03] <franksoncharles> oh?
[15:28:29] <Phelms215> then whenever the var is grabbed it pulls windows rather than local functions version
[15:28:36] <d4rklit3> how would i grab a swfobject w/ jquery
[15:28:43] <d4rklit3> can i just do $("MovieName")
[15:28:57] <Phelms215> maybe assign an id to it ?
[15:29:07] <Phelms215> on the <object>
[15:30:15] <d4rklit3> i can use
[15:30:19] <d4rklit3> document[name]
[15:30:25] <d4rklit3> to grab it
[15:30:29] <d4rklit3> but i want to grant it focus
[15:30:30] <DannyZB> e4kli5v - I think thats exactly what you do
[15:30:36] <d4rklit3> thought i could do it w/ jquery
[15:30:49] <DannyZB> jquery is just a wrapper .. it does the same thing in this case
[15:30:50] <molavy> hi,why this alarm show increasing every time i click on link,one for once click ,twice for second time
[15:30:52] <molavy> http://jsfiddle.net/JNe4r/4/
[15:31:18] <nbari> hi guys, sorry if this is offtopic but just wondering if any of you have any experience using the goddady web-hosting plans and if I can know your feedback
[15:31:52] <d4rklit3> DannyZB yeah but can i just do focus() on the dom element without jquery
[15:32:17] <molavy> please click some on it and see what happe
[15:32:57] <DannyZB> it doesn't matter
[15:33:04] <DannyZB> do it with jquery for better looking syntax
[15:33:16] <d4rklit3> lets say hte object has and id
[15:33:24] <d4rklit3> i just do #ID
[15:33:27] <d4rklit3> in jquery wrapper
[15:33:30] <franksoncharles> http://jsfiddle.net/yR7FK/1/
[15:33:34] <franksoncharles> that's it
[15:33:38] <DannyZB> yea
[15:33:41] <franksoncharles> obviously the file isn't there
[15:33:59] <DannyZB> why window.frank!?
[15:34:07] <DannyZB> just use frank= something
[15:34:11] <molavy> after fadeout it fadein again and again to finish number of click,but i want it previous run completely killed and and not just show for last click
[15:34:18] <molavy> any idea?
[15:34:20] <franksoncharles> what's his face told me to, I wasn't using window before
[15:34:41] <DannyZB> seriously?
[15:34:46] <DannyZB> never had such an issue
[15:34:51] <franksoncharles> http://jsfiddle.net/yR7FK/3/
[15:34:54] <DannyZB> don't think you need window
[15:35:15] <franksoncharles> if you put the alert inside the callback it returns the data from thue get
[15:35:24] <franksoncharles> move it outside and you get test
[15:35:42] <molavy> no idea?
[15:35:49] <molavy> http://jsfiddle.net/JNe4r/4/
[15:36:35] <molavy> i want show it for last click
[15:37:27] <molavy> please click some on "click me" for result,(it show up some time no just one time)
[15:37:47] <Phelms215> @franksoncharles your declaring it wrong
[15:38:28] <franksoncharles> how do I need to declare it
[15:38:40] <Phelms215> h.o
[15:39:37] <molavy> no answer?
[15:41:07] <Phelms215> http://jsfiddle.net/yR7FK/13/ < -- how you would but an example is http://jsfiddle.net/yR7FK/16/
[15:43:22] <franksoncharles> that doesn't work
[15:43:37] <franksoncharles> http://jsfiddle.net/yR7FK/17/ <-- look
[15:44:05] <franksoncharles> the problem is that the variable isn't being treated like a global variable inside the callback function
[15:44:59] <franksoncharles> I need to get the data from the get outside that function
[15:49:42] <molavy> oh,there is really no answer,i want you Placing the satellite in orbit
[15:49:45] <molavy> ?
[15:50:04] <franksoncharles> could this be a bug?
[15:50:37] <molavy> there is no idea?
[15:50:57] <Phelms215> i dont think so,  it looks like its just the $.get is returning an object
[15:51:02] <Phelms215> thats why its fucking up everything after it
[15:52:09] <franksoncharles> hmmmm
[15:52:30] <franksoncharles> know of any other ways to pull the contents of a file like that?
[15:52:37] <molavy> some help please
[15:52:40] <Phelms215> http://jsfiddle.net/yR7FK/32/
[15:52:48] <Phelms215> that should owrk
[15:52:52] <Phelms215> work** test with an actual file ?
[15:53:12] <molavy> http://jsfiddle.net/JNe4r/4/
[15:53:30] <Gorkyman> anyone experienced with fancybox?
[15:53:54] <franksoncharles> I've used orangebox a bit, its similar
[15:54:00] <franksoncharles> super easy to use too
[15:54:46] <molavy> please help me
[15:55:01] <Phelms215> has any1 ever called a blur inside of a blur before?
[15:55:06] <Phelms215> and molavy with what?
[15:55:19] <molavy> http://jsfiddle.net/JNe4r/4/
[15:55:21] <Gorkyman> i'm looking for a way to show fancybox right away when page is requested
[15:55:31] <Gorkyman> so taht user cant click anything
[15:55:47] <molavy> please click some time with no delay on "click me"
[15:56:13] <Phelms215> @gorkyman - should be simple.. just wrap the call in a $(document).ready(function () { // info here });
[15:56:28] <molavy> i want it show up jast for last click,but it show for every click
[15:57:03] <Gorkyman> Phelms215: yeah.. problem is that document can be ready after few sec
[15:57:32] <Phelms215> well jquery isnt loaded until that point either when dom is ready
[15:57:33] <Phelms215> @molavy
[15:57:43] <Phelms215> what are you trying to do ? when I click click me it says alert box
[15:57:55] <franksoncharles> gorky, set the page to hidden by default, and make drawing it a callback after the fancybox is shown
[15:59:30] <franksoncharles> you can load the contents of the page even if the css is hiding them
[16:00:23] <molavy> ok,click some click on it without delay,it show up again after it completely disappear .i want it show up for last click and last runing function killed completely
[16:01:06] <molavy> Phelms215,i want it dont appear after some second again,
[16:01:30] <molavy> it disappeared
[16:01:47] <Phelms215> you have fadeOut(3000); attached to it
[16:02:14] <Phelms215> http://jsfiddle.net/JNe4r/5/
[16:04:26] <molavy> that is because i want disappear alertbox automatically.
[16:07:00] <molavy> i don't tell  my need correctly, when you click on "click me" it appear and disappear automatically,all thing is true here.
[16:08:02] <molavy> but when you click some time fast on "click me" it appear and disappear and appear and disappear and ...
[16:08:16] <Phelms215> oh
[16:08:16] <Phelms215> h.o
[16:09:13] <molavy> i want when i click on it fast last run function kill and just last click run function
[16:10:12] <franksoncharles> so apparently its because $.get is an ajax request, and is running asynchronously
[16:10:33] <franksoncharles> so its not necessarily finished what its doing by the time the js is done running
[16:10:51] <molavy> pervious run's function kill and just last function run and show last alertbox
[16:10:53] <Phelms215> add a delay?
[16:11:05] <Dagoat> Anyone around with a thing for the validate plugin?
[16:11:44] <molavy> Phelms215,this is about me?
[16:13:12] <Phelms215> http://jsfiddle.net/JNe4r/8/
[16:13:15] <Dagoat> I have multiple forms scattered around that I want to run validate on, but I also want to have other buttons to do things in the course of the form. I know about class="cancel", but that actually cancels the form. I need to make buttons that are not bound to the stupid validate within the form.
[16:13:17] <Phelms215> is that what you want?
[16:14:44] <molavy> no,it don't  change code for show up just last click and stop previous run's
[16:27:57] <molavy> no idea?
[16:31:37] <molavy> there is really no idea?
[16:32:03] <molavy> Phelms215:no answer about this issue?

[17:05:11] <Shazer2> :/
[17:06:58] <beute> hey all, how do i select the next list item from one that has been selected... i'm trying to do this:         var nextchoice = $(this):nth-child(1)).text();
[17:07:08] <crossy> hi there
[17:07:24] <beute> also my first choice is set to this         var choice = $(this).text(); and that code works.
[17:08:22] <crossy> im having a problem while using jquery for the mouseover crossfade effect (it doesn't work in IE, the images sit below each other) and have pinpointed the problem to IE not allowing you to do it with images over 500px

[17:09:20] <beute> dilvie:  thank you aswell
[17:09:30] <Shazer2> can someone help me?
[17:10:19] <dilvie> Shazer2: your question doesn't make any sense.
[17:10:50] <dilvie> Shazer2: First of all, if you want to update something, you don't use GET - you use POST.
[17:10:53] <qom2> nooby question here, but how do I +1 so that the index can't be "0"? – return jQuery(el).attr('id') + ' = ' + (jQuery(el).index();
[17:11:12] <Shazer2> dilbie
[17:11:18] <Shazer2> dilvie*
[17:11:22] <Shazer2> i update from the URL
[17:12:09] <beute> dilvie: the fix...         var nextchoice = $(this).next().text(); ... thank you!!
[17:12:18] <crossy> im having a problem while using jquery for the mouseover crossfade effect (it doesn't work in IE, the images sit below each other) and have pinpointed the problem to IE not allowing you to do it with images over 500px. any idea how to get around this?

[17:19:48] <qom2> seriously
[17:20:06] <qom2> how hard can it be to addition
[17:20:06] <qom2> :(
[17:20:12] <qom2> don't get it
[17:20:29] <dilvie> qom2: it's not hard to add.
[17:20:33] <Shazer2> omg.
[17:20:35] <Shazer2> dilvie
[17:20:38] <Shazer2> this is NOT working
[17:20:41] <Shazer2> ive tried everything
[17:20:51] <dilvie> shazer2: code?
[17:21:01] <dilvie> jsfiddle.net
[17:21:11] <dilvie> qom2: you too.. jsfiddle.net
[17:21:16] <dilvie> let's see what you're trying to do
[17:21:20] <dilvie> and then maybe somebody can help
[17:21:45] <qom2> well, this is all I got: jQuery(el).index();
[17:21:51] <qom2> and it can return "0", I don't want that
[17:21:52] <Shazer2> dilvie: its near impossible to use jsfiddle for this
[17:21:54] <Shazer2> as i use php too
[17:21:59] <madprops> how can I make a overflow:hidden div scrollable?
[17:22:02] <qom2> so wanna do a ++, but it won't work
[17:22:19] <dilvie> madprops: change it to overflow:scroll
[17:22:44] <madprops> dilvie, no
[17:24:02] <snover> Shazer2: time to stop working on it for a while, or find a new career
[17:24:28] <Shazer2> no snover
[17:24:33] <Shazer2> its not a career
[17:24:35] <Shazer2> its a hobby..
[17:24:42] <Shazer2> and i bet not even you would know whats wrong with it
[17:24:44] <Shazer2> its weird
[17:24:54] <snover> I’m sure it isn’t :)
[17:25:23] <snover> You are right I wouldn’t know what is wrong though since you are not providing any actual code, just complaining that it “doesn’t work” :)
[17:25:31] <Shazer2> snover: http://jsfiddle.net/rjCk5/
[17:26:41] <snover> that code isn’t even complete enough to show where userJS comes from
[17:27:47] <dilvie> qom2: are you trying to transform the index into a number to display to the user that doesn't start with 0?
[17:27:58] <qom2> exactly
[17:28:07] <qom2> and failing miserably
[17:28:18] <Shazer2> dilvie

[17:28:35] <Shazer2> snover*
[17:28:35] <Shazer2> http://mysticpaste.com/view/9479
[17:28:47] <snover> errrrr.
[17:28:50] <dilvie> qom2: var displayIndex = +$(el).index() +1;
[17:28:54] <snover> ?101 @ Shazer2
[17:28:55] <bot-t> Shazer2, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[17:28:55] <dilvie> gotta go.
[17:29:11] <madprops> do I have to add the mousewheel plugin or is it built in?
[17:29:28] <snover> no fucking kidding it doesn’t work, you keep redefining the userJS variable over and over again in each new script block
[17:30:28] <Shazer2> everytime the page is loaded?
[17:30:30] <Shazer2> how is that wrong?
[17:30:56] <snover> var userJS = "user 1"; var userJS = "user 2"; var userJS = "user 3"; var userJS = "user 4";
[17:31:01] <snover> ?eval var userJS = "user 1"; var userJS = "user 2"; var userJS = "user 3"; var userJS = "user 4"; userJS;
[17:31:02] <bot-t> snover: "user 4"
[17:31:36] <Shazer2> but shouldn't it get what I click in the loop
[17:31:40] <Shazer2> where it fetches the array
[17:31:43] <snover> what?
[17:32:26] <Shazer2> shouldn't userJS be whatever one i click
[17:32:35] <Shazer2> seeing as I fetch all users in the while loop
[17:33:13] <snover> I don’t know why you are under the impression that JavaScript could possibly know anything about the context of the server-side code
[17:33:29] <qom2> is there some easier way to make sure that index isn't "0"? http://pastie.org/2229194
[17:33:30] <snover> or that even if it did know, how that would help
[17:33:50] <Shazer2> how else would i do it though? because this is the only way ican think of
[17:34:01] <snover> ?101 @ Shazer2
[17:34:01] <bot-t> Shazer2, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[17:34:04] <Shazer2> no
[17:34:10] <snover> yes.
[17:34:10] <Shazer2> i wouldnt read new to javascript
[17:34:14] <Shazer2> it wont have the answer
[17:34:23] <Shazer2> because ive already read it
[17:34:29] <snover> not very close apparently.
[17:35:06] <madprops> does jquery have built in mousewheel support or i need a plugin?
[17:35:08] <Shazer2> so are you resorting to ?101 because not even you know? ok
[17:35:27] <snover> No, I am resorting to 101 because you are being a help vampire.
[17:35:31] <snover> ?vampire @ Shazer2
[17:35:31] <bot-t> Shazer2, Stop Being a Help Vampire! http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/
[17:35:42] <ajpiano> madprops https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel
[17:36:10] <snover> ajpiano: can you provide a reasonable analogy here for me?
[17:37:06] <ajpiano> uhm
[17:37:15] <abjorn> =o
[17:37:30] <madprops> ajpiano, i see it has not being updated since 2010 is it reliable?
[17:37:36] <ajpiano> yes
[17:37:41] <ajpiano> mousewheels haven't really changed much
[17:37:54] <Shazer2> snover
[17:37:57] <Shazer2> i explained my question clearly
[17:37:59] <Shazer2> i get no answer
[17:38:02] <Shazer2> and you give me ?101
[17:38:07] <Shazer2> thats totally being a help vampire
[17:38:08] <Shazer2> hurrr
[17:38:20] <snover> The answer to your question lies in your understanding the basics of how javascript works
[17:38:30] <snover> which is what that book supplies
[17:39:11] <snover> Instead of acknowledging this, you instead try to goad me into giving you the answer on a silver platter by claiming I don’t know what I am talking about
[17:40:26] <ajpiano> Shazer2: you certainly have not explained your problem clearly, and i am inclined to agree with snover that the reason your code is failing is something to do with a fundamental misunderstaning of some javascript basics
[17:42:06] <abjorn> oh, shits goin down in here, i see
[17:42:27] <Shazer2> its not.
[17:42:33] <Shazer2> why does it work for other things?
[17:42:39] <Shazer2> but not this?
[17:42:47] <ajpiano> what is "it" and what "other things" are we talking about
[17:44:00] <Shazer2> promotion/demotion = it
[17:44:06] <ajpiano> ok
[17:44:14] <Shazer2> other things like processing logins and registration
[17:44:24] <ajpiano> so you're asking a bunch of strangers why one arbitrary piece of functionality on your website is working
[17:44:26] <ajpiano> and others aren't
[17:44:29] <ajpiano> nobody knows
[17:44:32] <Shazer2> ^
[17:44:36] <Shazer2> exactly, nobody does know
[17:44:41] <abjorn> why would they
[17:44:46] <ajpiano> .why does that state of affairs surprise you?
[17:44:47] <Shazer2> because you have 0 knowledge
[17:44:58] <abjorn> ...lol
[17:45:13] <Shazer2> and he laughs because its true
[17:45:24] <ajpiano> "Why Do Certain Features Not Work While Others Do on Shazer2's Website" is not something that is part of being a well rounded web developer
[17:45:25] <abjorn> No, I'm laughing because you have no idea who ajpiano and snover are
[17:45:39] <abjorn> Because if you did you wouldn't be saying that
[17:46:53] <abjorn> Now there's no reason to get so frustrated here, Shazer2. This is a place where you can get help, but you have to have reasonable expectations.
[17:47:22] <abjorn> No one here is obligated to give you help, and there may not always be someone able to give you help - but they will try, if you approach it the right way.
[17:47:28] <ajpiano> yes.  posting a bunch of php that renders a tiny bit of javascript and then asking why your features don't work right is not going to get you to the answer
[17:47:41] <naomi> can someone take a quick look at this simple dom manipulation question? http://jsfiddle.net/
[17:47:45] <naomi> i'm stumped ^
[17:47:53] <ajpiano> naomi: wrong link ;)
[17:47:54] <abjorn> I think you pasted the wrong link, naomi
[17:48:04] <naomi> wups, forgot to save http://jsfiddle.net/a7Rk3/
[17:48:30] <danieliser> i have a function in dbclick for all divs that are children of .sort.. this works fine unless i add another div to .sort. the new divs dont get the click function. any ideas?
[17:48:40] <Shazer2> abjorn
[17:48:40] <ajpiano> naomi: use a combination of wrapAll and nextUntil
[17:48:42] <ajpiano> ?wrapAll
[17:48:43] <bot-t> .wrapAll(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[17:48:43] <Shazer2> I'm really sorry.
[17:48:44] <ajpiano> ?nextUntil
[17:48:45] <bot-t> .nextUntil([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[17:48:56] <Shazer2> I'm an impatient person, and when I don't get my way I get the shits.
[17:49:04] <abjorn> lol that's a nice way of putting it
[17:49:08] <abjorn> "I get this shits" I like that
[17:49:29] <Shazer2> Can you explain who ajpiano and snover are?
[17:49:41] <Shazer2> I apologise also, ajpiano, snover and abjorn.
[17:50:12] <ajpiano> Shazer2: i'm the jquery project developer relations lead, snover is a former core committer
[17:50:18] <ajpiano> Shazer2: it's ok
[17:50:21] <Shazer2> omg.
[17:50:23] <Shazer2> i'm so sorry.
[17:50:30] <abjorn> lol
[17:50:33] <danieliser> any ideas on my question?
[17:50:37] <abjorn> it's fine, Shazer2
[17:50:43] <abjorn> no need to apologize to me, anyways
[17:50:46] <abjorn> I just joined this party :D
[17:50:48] <ajpiano> you just have to understand what the standards are for asking an insightful question and paring it down to an issue that someone who isn't like, a developer on Your Site can assist with
[17:51:10] <abjorn> @danieliser: sounds like you need .live
[17:51:12] <Shazer2> ajpiano: it's just that the problem I am facing is so incredibly difficult to explain
[17:51:36] <naomi> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/a7Rk3/2/
[17:51:42] <naomi> is this the best way ?
[17:51:56] <abjorn> looks bueno naomi
[17:52:01] <ajpiano> Shazer2: it sounds like the problem is you have some loop structuer on the server side and you are expecting that information that is availalbe in the server side loop will be available in the client side
[17:52:06] <naomi> abjorn: thanks :)
[17:52:16] <ajpiano> yep looks goo
[17:52:32] * abjorn wiggles for great good
[17:52:58] <danieliser> abjorn: any credit to this http://jupiterjs.com/news/why-you-should-never-use-jquery-live
[17:53:02] <ajpiano> Shazer2, one thing that would help is putting a demo together with only JS/html/css - no php would probably help a lot
[17:53:19] <Shazer2> ajpiano: i don't know how it is possible without the php
[17:53:20] <Shazer2> but i will try
[17:53:31] <ajpiano> Shazer2: take the output of the php
[17:53:34] <ajpiano> and go to the page
[17:53:36] <ajpiano> and do view source
[17:53:41] <ajpiano> then you have the rendered output of the php
[17:53:57] <abjorn> @danieliser: He's not exactly wrong but he's not exactly right - things like .live have certain uses, and shouldn't always be used. But there are cases like yours where it's appropriate.
[17:55:01] <abjorn> Well, at least I assume it may be appropriate for you, I don't know the specifics of what you're doing.
[17:55:27] <abjorn> But "never" use live is kind of strong wording to use.
[17:56:10] <Shazer2> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/744cN/4/
[17:56:14] <Shazer2> here is sort of what i need
[17:56:50] <snover> Shazer2: do you understand the concept of passing arguments to functions?
[17:57:15] <ajpiano> Shazer2: do you have multiple versions of this being output onto your page
[17:57:21] <danieliser> abjorn: making a drag/drop form editor to work with jquery form wizard plugin.. currently getting editor functionality working but demo so far is at http://sandbox.wizardinternetsolutions.com/forms/
[17:57:25] <ajpiano> and each one does something like userJS = "someUserName"
[17:58:56] <danieliser> abjorn: i have the fields sortable and dbclick to edit options..works fine for fields loaded at pageload.. but any fields added by jquey dont get the function..
[17:59:03] <abjorn> @danieliser: Well, if you're working with widgets, you may not want to use live. You could just make the event handler for the click function a named function and bind it whenever you create the new element.
[17:59:11] <Shazer2> ajpiano: multiple versions?
[17:59:18] <Shazer2> let me explain one more time, ill try be as clear as possible
[17:59:32] <danieliser> abjorn: i tried that.. isnt working the way i figured..
[17:59:39] <ajpiano> Shazer2: like, this function promoteUser appears multiple times on the same page
[17:59:44] <ajpiano> each in a <script> tag
[17:59:50] <ajpiano> that is being generated by php?
[17:59:56] <abjorn> @danieliser: Well, try and put up an example of what you're doing on jsfiddle
[18:00:08] <snover> ajpiano: yes.
[18:00:15] <snover> ajpiano: or well
[18:00:24] <snover> WHATEVER YOU DO IT
[18:00:48] <abjorn> lol
[18:00:51] <ajpiano> Shazer2: if you have multiple script tags on a the same webpage
[18:00:53] <ajpiano> and one is
[18:00:55] <abjorn> ahhh, my bladder beckons
[18:01:04] <ajpiano> <script> foo = "bar"; </script>
[18:01:06] <ajpiano> and the second one is
[18:01:07] <Shazer2> alright, so in php I select all the users from the database, i output all usernames and display a link each to all of them that executes promoteUser() or demoteUser() based on their level (admin, normal).. when i am clicking promote on one user (Garry) it promotes him to admin refreshes and then when i press promote on another user (Skitzed) it says that Garry is already admin, yet I am clicking
[18:01:08] <Shazer2> the link next to Skitzed.. I presume it si keeping Garry in userJS and not updating for some reason
[18:01:21] <ajpiano> <script> foo = "baz"; </script>
[18:01:24] <danieliser> abjorn: nvm  found it. called the dbclick function when i created a new tab but forgot to add it to the new field funtion
[18:01:32] <ajpiano> there is only ONE "foo" variable for the wholy page
[18:01:42] <ajpiano> and it will be updated to the value of the last thing that updates it
[18:02:29] <Shazer2> ok ajpiano
[18:02:39] <ajpiano> this is known as the Global Scope
[18:02:43] <Shazer2> echo "<script type='text/javascript'>var userJS = '" . $rows['username'] . "';</script>";
[18:02:45] <Shazer2> but im doing that just once?
[18:02:54] <abjorn> @danieliser: Oh, cool :)
[18:02:59] <Shazer2> or is it setting it for each user in the while loop, ajpiano?
[18:03:16] <ajpiano> Shazer2: you have a "while" loop, and each out echos out that script?
[18:03:33] <Shazer2> yes
[18:03:34] <Shazer2> correct
[18:03:36] <ajpiano> right
[18:03:37] <ajpiano> so then
[18:03:47] <ajpiano> so if you had 40 names
[18:03:50] <ajpiano> it would set the variable 40 times
[18:03:56] <ajpiano> and the variable would be equal to the 40th name
[18:04:17] <ajpiano> Shazer2: a much better approach would be to like, store some information in the dom and get it back out in the event handler
[18:04:35] <ajpiano> i will make a quick demo that will HOPEFULLY illustrate the concept you should be using
[18:05:12] <Shazer2> ajpiano: i actually understand why it does that now
[18:05:17] <Shazer2> amazing what happens when i listen and explain
[18:05:21] <ajpiano> ok that is good :)
[18:05:22] <Shazer2> also ajpiano is this you: echo "<script type='text/javascript'>var userJS = '" . $rows['username'] . "';</script>";
[18:05:25] <Shazer2> wait..
[18:05:26] <Shazer2> lol
[18:05:32] <Shazer2> https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1396366703/twitpic_pool_reasonably_small.png
[18:05:33] <Shazer2> there
[18:05:39] <ajpiano> haha yep
[18:05:40] <abjorn> Am I the only one who imagines an orangle, muscley douchebag from jersey everytime he sees the name "DOM"?
[18:05:46] <ajpiano> abjorn: NOPE
[18:05:47] <ajpiano> :D
[18:05:58] <abjorn> :D
[18:06:12] <danieliser> abjorn++
[18:06:37] <abjorn> lol
[18:07:24] <Shazer2> ajpiano: did you make the fiddle?
[18:07:27] <Shazer2> /demo
[18:07:31] <ajpiano> Shazer2 http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/744cN/7/
[18:07:55] <abjorn> Phillipa
[18:08:10] <danieliser> does this channel do the ++ props?
[18:08:20] <ajpiano> danieliser, kinda, it depends if the bots are sleeping
[18:08:37] <abjorn> the bot that does that doesn't sleep much tho
[18:08:43] <abjorn> unlike bot-t :(
[18:09:02] <danieliser> isnt that the point of a bot they are always on?
[18:09:20] <ajpiano> theoretically
[18:09:24] <abjorn> Well, it's gotta run on a computer, and not everyone can keep a bot running on their computer all day
[18:09:26] <ajpiano> botty has been a little flakey lately
[18:09:34] <abjorn> also sometimes they break...
[18:09:50] <sdwrage> Hey all. I am currently trying to create a layout that is newspaper-like but am using a pdf generator that has javascript support but no css3 support. Is there any plugin that would allow me to split a div's text up into two columns at a specific height?
[18:09:52] <Assimilater> can anyone help me figure out ui's how ui's classes work. I created as much as this by copy pasting styles but i'd prefer to use js to add the classes already in the ui theme: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/sv7Rb/
[18:10:04] <abjorn> I have a VPS I run my bot (on another chan) on, but it's written in Node so it's stability is questionable ;(
[18:10:38] <danieliser> cant they be setup on a vps with a cron job to kill and restart the process everyso often? thats what ive got for my website screenshot generator
[18:10:53] <Assimilater> holy crap reading through that i get the message i'm tired...i'm trying to do something *like* a button and i want to use events like ui's js does to add the classes of a button, but am not sure how to do it
[18:10:53] <abjorn> It could, but bot-t doesn't run on a VPS.
[18:11:20] <snover> it does
[18:11:24] <abjorn> It does?
[18:11:25] <snover> yes
[18:11:27] <abjorn> Coldhead, you lie
[18:11:35] <snover> not that it matters
[18:11:38] <snover> tempsy is mia
[18:11:48] <abjorn> I've never seen temp01 talk, like
[18:11:48] <abjorn> ever
[18:11:53] <Shazer2> err
[18:11:54] <Shazer2> ajpiano
[18:11:56] <snover> he used to talk all the time
[18:11:57] <Shazer2> im so confused now
[18:11:59] <snover> then he disappeared
[18:12:13] <abjorn> shame
[18:12:18] <danieliser> i found that my thumbshot setup would freeze or close every now and then so i set it to kill and restart every 5 minutes
[18:12:28] <snover> big shame
[18:12:30] <snover> we miss him
[18:12:33] <abjorn> Yeah, my bot crashes like every day.
[18:12:33] <snover> COME BACK TEMP01
[18:12:57] <abjorn> Cause Node is like "lol gonna reset your TCP connection"
[18:14:07] <Shazer2> ajpiano
[18:14:08] <Shazer2> you there?
[18:14:19] <ajpiano> Shazer2: yes
[18:14:21] <Assimilater> if someone is willing to work with me on this i'd much appreciate it, I've got a ways to go through new jquery ui territory :S
[18:14:23] <ajpiano> you didn't ask a question though :p
[18:14:32] <ajpiano> Assimilater: look at the dialog source code :p
[18:14:41] <sdwrage> Hey all. I am currently trying to create a layout that is newspaper-like but am using a pdf generator that has javascript support but no css3 support. Is there any plugin that would allow me to split a div's text up into two columns at a specific height?
[18:14:45] <Assimilater> dialog?
[18:14:51] <abjorn> I'd help but I haven't used jquery-ui much
[18:15:08] <ajpiano> lol i don't konw why i said dialog
[18:15:08] <Assimilater> and the soruce code is hard for me to read...it being all compressed and everything
[18:15:19] <ajpiano> Assimilater: um, the unminifed code is mighty available
[18:15:23] <danieliser> get the full
[18:15:29] <Assimilater> uniminified....
[18:15:33] <ajpiano> Assimilater: you know there is a jQuery UI button widget
[18:15:41] <Shazer2> ajpiano: i don't understand how that works
[18:15:43] <Assimilater> ya unfortunatley it's not *quite* what i want
[18:15:49] <Shazer2> how can I do this within the while loop
[18:15:51] <Shazer2> on each username
[18:15:51] <Assimilater> i want a button with a break down the middle
[18:15:58] <Assimilater> essentially two buttons in one
[18:16:08] <Assimilater> and the right half
[18:16:11] <Assimilater> to be when you click it
[18:16:12] <Assimilater> a menu
[18:16:18] <ajpiano> Shazer2: you don't write the javascript in PHP
[18:16:26] <ajpiano> you don't have to output that javaScript inside the while loop, at all
[18:16:30] <ajpiano> it only needs to be declared once
[18:16:34] <ajpiano> and it handles all the cases on the page
[18:16:44] <ajpiano> there is not a one to one releationship between functions and elements on the page that use the functoins
[18:17:01] <ajpiano> Shazer2: have i already directed you to the jQuery Fundamentals book?
[18:17:06] <Shazer2> :/
[18:17:15] <Assimilater> ajpiano: i would be delighted if you could tell me there's an easier to way to make two buttons in one like the visual i have on the fiddle and when you click the right half you see a ui menu (like autocomplete)
[18:17:41] <Shazer2> where do i outpit javascript then ajpiano?
[18:17:52] <ajpiano> Shazer2: you put a script tag at the bottom of the body
[18:18:37] <ajpiano> Shazer2: with all due respect you do have a fair bit to learn about this whole javascript thing, i think you should probbaly spend some time reading or whatnot
[18:18:51] <ajpiano> if js is only a hobby for you, then you have no deadlines, so you should try to learn things the right way
[18:19:01] <ajpiano> i feel like we had this conversation a couple days ago p
[18:19:24] <Shazer2> ajpiano
[18:19:27] <Shazer2> firstly i just wanna ask something
[18:19:46] <Shazer2> how can i declare userJS once without getting ALL usernames in the while loop?
[18:20:00] <ajpiano> don't  declare it in the while loop
[18:20:05] <ajpiano> also... don't generate your javascript in php
[18:20:19] <abjorn> ^^^^
[18:20:45] <Shazer2> so how do i get all the users?
[18:20:50] <Shazer2> to declare on userJS?
[18:21:06] * Assimilater just realized there's an ajpiano and abjorn, the ajp versus abj was confusing me, lol
[18:21:10] <ajpiano> you embed the data in the DOM and then you have a handler that is able to fetch is
[18:21:14] <abjorn> I once did a bunch of JavaScript debugging for a client who had a Mobile ASP.NET Project that did...a lot of generating JavaScript in the C# and ASP Templates...it was a nightmare.
[18:21:19] <abjorn> lol assimilater
[18:21:21] <Shazer2> ajpiano
[18:21:25] <ajpiano> Assimilater: i would probably make one ui button and another custom element and use some css to position them
[18:21:27] <Shazer2> embed the data in the DOM? O.O
[18:21:36] <ajpiano> Shazer2: just like i did in that example
[18:21:40] <ajpiano> there is one handler for all anchors
[18:21:41] <abjorn> .data!
[18:21:51] <ajpiano> and when clicked, it goes and gets the previous element in the DOM and reads its text
[18:21:52] <ajpiano> or something
[18:21:56] <ajpiano> along those lines
[18:22:12] <Shazer2> ajpiano: but my usernames are in a db
[18:22:15] <Assimilater> ajpiano: custom element? you talking about the autocomplete menu?
[18:22:19] <Shazer2> i dont just specify them
[18:22:20] <ajpiano> no i mean like, a div
[18:22:21] <ajpiano> :p
[18:22:38] <Assimilater> i'm sure, but just to be double sure, you looked at my fiddle?
[18:22:40] <ajpiano> Shazer2: you could do var arrayOfUsers = [];
[18:22:44] <abjorn> Wait, I forget, does .data actually store it in the DOM, or just related to a DOM element...
[18:23:01] <ajpiano> Shazer2: and then in the while loop, arrayOfUsers.push("username");
[18:23:07] <ajpiano> and then eventually there will be an array of users in javascript
[18:23:11] <ajpiano> abjorn: just related
[18:23:15] <ajpiano> everything is in jQuery.cache
[18:23:18] <abjorn> ah yeah
[18:23:25] <ajpiano> Assimilater: i did
[18:23:34] <abjorn> Still can't use data- attributes everywhere, right?
[18:23:48] <ajpiano> you can use data-attributes everywhere
[18:23:49] <Assimilater> ajpiano: ok so you're talking two buttons, use css to get rid of half the border radius and position them? I'm understanding correctly?
[18:23:50] <ajpiano> they just do something different
[18:23:55] <Assimilater> actually that is a lot simpler, lol
[18:24:00] <ajpiano> Assimilater: yeah, that's what i'd do probably
[18:24:03] <ajpiano> and i'd use the UI classes
[18:24:08] * Assimilater nods
[18:24:20] <ajpiano> Assimilater, also, toggleClass("class", trueOrFalseSwitch) is your friend
[18:25:01] * Assimilater never heard of toggleClass
[18:25:07] <ajpiano> Assimilater: also, so is .html(function(currentHtml) {  return currentHtml == "foo" ? "bar" : "foo";   });
[18:25:09] <Assimilater> but it makes sense... there's a whole bunch of toggle stuff in jquery
[18:25:11] <ajpiano> or some other idiom
[18:25:27] <ajpiano> ?toggleClass
[18:25:28] <bot-t> .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[18:25:33] <abjorn> Man, this Cyberbully ABC movie is hilarious
[18:25:36] <ajpiano> ?html(function)
[18:25:37] <bot-t> .html(function): Set the HTML contents of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/#html2
[18:26:02] <Assimilater> lol, never thought of using a function in html()
[18:26:09] <Shazer2> ajpiano
[18:26:10] <Shazer2> im lost.
[18:26:30] <Assimilater> ajpiano: can i get your IRC hours? :P You're the most helpful person on this channel! haha
[18:26:39] <abjorn> irc hours lol
[18:26:39] <ajpiano> Assimilater: it's jsut a convenient form of .each(function() { $(this).html( $(this).html() + "foo" );  }):
[18:26:49] <ajpiano> haha Assimilater
[18:26:52] <abjorn> Shazer2, you really need to take a step back and start from the ground up with JavaScript, I think.
[18:26:53] <ajpiano> i am ALWAYS WATCHING
[18:26:55] <ajpiano> is ;)
[18:27:02] <ajpiano> Shazer2: i'm sorry
[18:27:04] <ajpiano> that you are lost
[18:27:21] <abjorn> That eloquent javascript is a good start...
[18:27:31] <Shazer2> :(
[18:27:33] <ajpiano> Shazer2: do you have any like, friends or colleagues in real life who you could ask to spend a couple hours with you
[18:27:36] <ajpiano> explainign this stuff
[18:27:40] <ajpiano> because it is a really heavy lift
[18:27:50] <Shazer2> ajpiano: no, i'm the only person at my school most probably whod oes web development
[18:27:54] <ajpiano> there are a lot of abstract concepts that you need to understand
[18:28:24] <ajpiano> Shazer2, high school, college ?
[18:28:40] <Shazer2> year 10, high school
[18:28:49] <ajpiano> aha, so you're definitely on a bit of an island
[18:28:55] <abjorn> I was gonna say, what college doesn't have web devs...
[18:29:04] <ajpiano> there are a LOT of really good books out there
[18:29:04] <Shazer2> im young, 15
[18:29:08] <ajpiano> on like Web Application Development
[18:29:18] <ajpiano> that can explain things to you like how to separate your serverside code from clientside, etc.
[18:29:20] <abjorn> That's around when I got started, Shazer2 c:
[18:29:28] <ajpiano> i started around then too :)
[18:29:33] <abjorn> Well, with web development, anyways
[18:29:37] <abjorn> been programming since I was like 12
[18:30:06] <Shazer2> ajpiano
[18:30:14] <Shazer2> does Alex Sexton use this chan?
[18:30:34] <abjorn> He's in here right now
[18:30:38] <ajpiano> he's been known to, why do you ask
[18:31:07] <Assimilater> lol, you guys got a leg on me on web dev on starting, i started this last august, i just turned 18 at the time
[18:31:14] <Assimilater> from 13-18 i stuck with compiled languages
[18:31:21] <ajpiano> oh man i love looking at my website from when i was 15 , 10 years ago, on web.archive
[18:31:27] <abjorn> lol
[18:31:32] <abjorn> my stuff at the time was horrendous
[18:31:37] <abjorn> I'd seen better stuff on geocities
[18:31:45] <ajpiano> http://web.archive.org/web/20010407141922/http://ajpiano.topcities.com/index2.htm
[18:31:46] <ajpiano> LOL
[18:31:54] <abjorn> lol
[18:31:59] <abjorn> whats sad is that sbetter than my first stuff
[18:32:09] <snover> oh man, you had the paint shop pro filters going and everything too huh
[18:32:13] <abjorn> Imagine a green background with yellow text and no images
[18:32:18] <ajpiano> any "blog" where the date and time consists of you tpying the date and time into some raw html
[18:32:23] <ajpiano> is baller
[18:32:58] <abjorn> I applaud the douglas adams book
[18:33:11] <ajpiano> also like, whoa, i totally didn't realise how bad the whole Free Credit Report thing was about to get over the ensuing 10 years
[18:33:24] <abjorn> lol
[18:33:35] <snover> prescient, but not enough
[18:33:54] <abjorn> now we have those disturbing commercials with the "credit scores" in spandex
[18:34:50] <abjorn> Anyways, Shazer2, Alex is signed in here a lot, but I don't think he actually participates in the channel much these days.
[18:35:07] <Assimilater> ajpiano: lol, a bit easier on the styling side :P http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/sv7Rb/2/
[18:35:16] <Assimilater> now about the menu....
[18:35:36] <Shazer2> whats his name
[18:36:02] <abjorn> slexaxton
[18:36:30] <abjorn> porque?
[18:37:35] <Shazer2> oh ok
[18:37:37] <Shazer2> wondering
[18:38:11] <abjorn> ajpiano: When's there gonna be another yayQuery? :<
[18:38:21] <ajpiano> eventually
[18:38:39] <ajpiano> ;)
[18:38:43] <Shazer2> well, idk what to do now
[18:38:46] <abjorn> lol which I guess means you are all pretty busy :p
[18:38:48] <Shazer2> this has halted me
[18:39:07] <Assimilater> so how can i make a menu (like what's used in autocomplete) appear when the right button gets clicked?
[18:39:29] <abjorn> Well, if this is a hobby you're working on, Shazer2, maybe you need to start smaller and simpler?
[18:39:35] <SlexAxton> what do i not do?
[18:39:42] <abjorn> oh hai
[18:39:46] <abjorn> sorry for highlighting you
[18:40:00] <abjorn> shazer2 was asking if you were in here
[18:40:23] <SlexAxton> sup Shazer2 ?
[18:42:05] <Shazer2> not much
[18:42:12] <Shazer2> was just watching that superclassy inheritance video on vimeo
[18:42:14] <Assimilater> ajpiano: still with me?
[18:42:25] <ajpiano> Assimilater: um, not really
[18:42:26] <ajpiano> :p
[18:42:29] <Assimilater> haha
[18:42:33] <Assimilater> can i persuade you back? :P
[18:42:37] <ajpiano> haha
[18:42:42] <Shazer2> no idea how you guys understand all this
[18:42:44] <bobdobbs> Hey guys. I've got a function that I'm trying to call. I make the call and get no errors, but the function doesn't do anything.
[18:42:54] <Shazer2> developer tools ^
[18:42:57] <bobdobbs> http://www.pastie.org/2229263
[18:43:13] <bobdobbs> The code is for this page: http://gogo/contact.html
[18:43:30] <bobdobbs> The function uses an ajax post.
[18:43:33] <ajpiano> Shazer2: spending a lot of time w/ it and letting the next 5 years do their magic will help a lot ;)
[18:43:44] <bobdobbs> Watching with firebug, the ajax request never happens.
[18:43:51] <danieliser> how can you clear a variable in a foreach loop? ive tried setting it = '' and unset().. not working
[18:44:11] <ajpiano> danieliser, a property of an object?
[18:44:27] <danieliser> sorry meant to say php
[18:45:55] <ejo> ajpiano, where does $.getScript() actually put the javascript that it obtains?  does it just get executed but never stored in the DOM?
[18:45:58] <Shazer2> ajpiano: you still there?
[18:46:19] <Assimilater> >:|
[18:46:22] <ajpiano> ejo: it inserts it into the <head> and then removes it
[18:46:40] <ejo> interesting.. I wonder why no option to keep it somewhere... would help with debugging
[18:46:43] <abjorn> woah, people, there are other people here than ajpiano lol
[18:47:04] <bobdobbs> oh wait... it seems to be working
[18:47:05] <Assimilater> abjorn: can you help me get an autocomplete menu to appear on button push as opposed to text input? :P
[18:47:05] <ajpiano> Assimilater: what are we trying to do here
[18:47:05] <danieliser> getting options in a string, exploding to array and then extruding options.. problem is say 1 has option label, 2 doesnt. well 2 gets 1s label and then 3 gets its own..
[18:47:08] <ejo> thanks for the answer, I wouldn't have known it was temporarily in <head>
[18:47:16] <Assimilater> ajpiano: ^^
[18:47:16] <bobdobbs> I must have missed something in my debugging process.
[18:47:32] <ajpiano> Assimilater: an "autocomplete" menu or just a jQuery ui menu that has some hardcoded choices in it ?
[18:47:33] <abjorn> Assimilater: Well, I mean...well...fuck, now I look stupid.
[18:47:36] <bobdobbs> I think I got my local dev and dev scripts mixed up.
[18:47:44] <Assimilater> abjorn: lol, sorry
[18:47:55] <abjorn> lol well I can try, if I take a look
[18:48:00] <Assimilater> ajpiano: there's a 'menu' that's like not attached to autocomplete?
[18:48:20] <ajpiano> Assimilater,yep, autocomplete just creates a "menu" out of the results it fetches
[18:48:34] <Assimilater> ajpiano: oh, i didnt' see that in the ui widget docs....
[18:48:40] <delinquentme> soo i've got a little json string coming in as .. well as string .. how do i convert it into JSON in jquery .. so that i can chop it apart?
[18:48:41] <ajpiano> it's not released yet
[18:48:48] <ajpiano> check out the latest jquery ui on git
[18:48:51] <Assimilater> ajpiano: ah, well yes that's what i want
[18:48:54] <ajpiano> "menu" is there in 1.8, just hidden
[18:49:09] <Assimilater> ajpiano: i can barely figure out git....lol i started fiddling with it the other week
[18:49:19] <Assimilater> but i don't have time to really learn it before i leave for mongolia
[18:49:20] <ajpiano> Assimilater: we got you covereed
[18:49:27] <ajpiano> Assimilater: http://bit.ly/jquigitjs
[18:49:27] <abjorn> @delinquentme: jQuery will parse that for you
[18:49:29] <ajpiano> Assimilater: http://bit.ly/jquigitcss
[18:49:39] <ajpiano> those are the latest jquery ui js and css, rebuilt every hour or something
[18:50:00] <Assimilater> oh i can bookmark this :)
[18:50:02] <Assimilater> yay!
[18:50:09] <abjorn> @delinquentme: If a ajax request receives JSON it will parse it into a JavaScript object.
[18:50:23] <abjorn> In jQuery, that is
[18:50:26] <delinquentme> abjorn, it comes in as a string though
[18:50:31] <delinquentme> string >> json
[18:50:34] <Assimilater> anyways
[18:50:34] <delinquentme> is what im after
[18:50:40] <Assimilater> ajpiano: so ya, i want a hard coded menu
[18:50:46] <abjorn> Oh so it's not actually JSON/
[18:50:47] <abjorn> ?
[18:50:56] <delinquentme> correct
[18:51:03] <delinquentme> its ins JSON format
[18:51:07] <delinquentme> however its a string
[18:51:14] <abjorn> well then it's still json
[18:51:26] <abjorn> that's what I mean, a string of json data will be parsed by jquery
[18:51:27] <delinquentme> its coming in through an AJAX with a ton of other data
[18:51:42] <delinquentme> {"SQL":"128","SALES":"128","WEB BASED":"115","MARKETING":"137"}
[18:51:47] <Assimilater> ajpiano: (you should be able to see the ul i'm wanting to make the menu from on my fiddle)
[18:52:31] <abjorn> Yeah, delinquentme, if that's the response the ajax request is getting then jquery will parse it
[18:52:38] <delinquentme> kk
[18:53:03] <ajpiano> Assimilater: you'll have to give me a few, can't look at it quite yet
[18:53:17] <Assimilater> ajpiano: k
[18:53:41] <abjorn> hmmm lets see whats on netflix to watch tonight
[18:55:08] <ejo> So, I'm (after some user input on a page) loading some javascript using $.ajax() and appending it to the <script> element that is the last element in <body>.  This works, in the sense that the javascript thus loaded becomes useable, the functions in it are able to be run.  That's great.  Now my remaining problem is that Firebug doesn't see the newly appended script.  I mean, it shows it...
[18:55:10] <ejo> ...under HTML, but it doesn't turn up in Firebug's Script tab.  Any suggestions?
[18:55:56] <abjorn> Try it in chrome dev tools maybe
[18:56:08] <ejo> in other words just a firebug limitation?
[18:56:17] <abjorn> Maybe, or you could be using it wrong.
[18:56:19] <ejo> I just want to know if I'm doing something not quite complete on this side
[18:56:24] <abjorn> I've never tried debugging that sort of thing with firebug
[18:56:38] <ejo> fortunately I don't actually have a bug at this point :)
[18:56:59] <ejo> it's just that I'd be happier if the appended script would show up in the debugger's script awareness
[18:57:09] <ejo> maybe I'll ask the firebug folks.
[18:57:49] <misterm> ejo: you're appending it the script tag, or creating a new one?
[18:58:05] <Assimilater> ejo: well also in the console you can see the response html when you click on the ajax request
[18:58:11] <abjorn> awww yeah The Naked Gun is on Netflix
[18:58:32] <delinquentme> so if im getting random values back fro both my keys and values .. how do i get the first key of a json string .. is s = json string .. shouldn't s[0] do this?
[18:58:44] <Assimilater> ejo: oh debugging....never really tried using firebug's debugger...
[18:58:53] <Assimilater> just lots of console.log()'s :P
[18:59:49] <ejo> misterm: I appended it to the script tag.  Maybe if I create a new one firebug would notice?
[19:00:27] <ejo> Assimilater: sure, I'm receiving the script via AJAX as intended, it's getting inserted into the DOM properly, and then I'm able to call the js/jquery code within it.  It's all working great.
[19:01:00] <ejo> Assimilater: the only 'problem' is that firebug doesn't seem to realize that I just added a bunch of js functions to the existing script on the page, so it can't set breakpoints in them etc. in case I needed to.
[19:01:08] <misterm> ejo: it's worth a shot...it's a little unusual to be altering the contents of a script tag
[19:01:16] <ejo> & If you haven't used firebug's debug probe it's awesome.
[19:01:32] <misterm> ejo: I'm pretty sure chrome developer tools will recognize appended script tags
[19:01:56] <ejo> misterm: yeah, I was starting to think that.  I think I'll mock it up with a new script tag with a src attribute as if it had been loaded initially
[19:01:59] <L1> Say I had $('.foo').before('<p>' + $(this).data('bar') + '</p>'); In that example $(this) doesn't work, is there a way of getting a reference to the current '.foo'?
[19:02:20] <ejo> Yeah I'm happier with chrome/chromium lately in that regard
[19:02:38] <d4rklit3> why is it so bad to leave console.log methods in your script that mozilla has to make it so the most widely used version of their browser breaks on anytime that happens
[19:02:40] <Assimilater> L1: $('.foo') affects all .foo
[19:03:31] <L1> Assiimlater: yes, and I want a reference to the current .foo - is it not possible using this syntax? Would I need to explicitely itterate over each .foo, applying my logic? Say, with $.each('.foo' ...
[19:03:39] <misterm> L1: you would do var foo = $('#whatever'); foo.before('<p>' + foo.data('bar') + '</p>');
[19:03:52] <misterm> L1: or if there's multiple foo, loop through them
[19:04:02] <Assimilater> L1: there is no 'current foo' if you modify all of them....
[19:04:13] <L1> Ahh, I see
[19:04:16] <Assimilater> L1: i've only seen '$(this)' inside jquery callback functions
[19:04:17] <L1> Thank you both :)
[19:04:39] <Jester831> hmmm, I could use some help with http://wbo.guavaworksdev.com/ --- I'm getting the error that "Uncaught TypeError: Object function (E,F){return new o.fn.init(E,F)} has no method 'fancybox'"
[19:05:34] <Assimilater> ajpiano: if you're still here, i don't mean to be a bother but i was wondering if i could get a timeline on what 'a few' means
[19:05:41] <Jester831> I have the associated css, and dependencies all loaded in the proper order, and the js in question is derivative of another working piece I had
[19:05:50] <ajpiano> Assimilater: i am like walking Shazer2 through DOM traversal 101
[19:05:51] <ajpiano> it might be a while
[19:05:52] <ajpiano> :p
[19:05:59] <abjorn> rofl
[19:06:03] <Assimilater> lol, k
[19:06:28] <Assimilater> so now i know to work on another task :P
[19:06:40] <misterm> Jester831: how would one reproduce the error?
[19:06:44] <delinquentme> abjorn, so im not sure that it happens automatically? .. i just ran this:  http://pastebin.com/R0dsH1dq   and it definitely didnt split it up into 8 chunks .. instead it broke them at every letter...
[19:06:46] <Jester831> click on a ring
[19:07:04] <Jester831> under pick your material
[19:07:14] <ajpiano> Assimilater: see what you can't figure out from these demos :) http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/menu/index.html
[19:07:39] <abjorn> I'm not really sure what you're trying to do delinquentme
[19:07:59] <systemfault> Hmm, the lead dev of firebug just said bye bye and is going to work with the chrome dev tools team, cool :)
[19:08:22] <abjorn> lol
[19:09:07] <ajpiano> Assimilater: pretty sure the contextmenu example is exactly what you're looking for
[19:09:16] <Assimilater> ajpiano: that it is :)
[19:09:22] <delinquentme> abjorn, the string:    s ={"SQL":"128","SALES":"128","WEB BASED":"115","MARKETING":"137"}   <, has variable values and keys .. and i want to get the keys and values .. normally if the keys were static it would just be s['SQL'] etc.. but since they arent .. how do i select them?
[19:09:29] <ejo> misterm: looks like the DOM isn't happy about having another whole <script> ... </script> inserted between the existing one and the </body> tag.  It forcibly removes the <script>...</script> tags from what I insert, forcing the contents of the inserted js to show up as just text.  And I did use the 'type="text/javascript"' attribute
[19:09:40] <ejo> so maybe I'll stick with just appending inside the one existing script section
[19:09:58] <Jester831> where you able to reproduce the eror misterm?
[19:10:02] <misterm> ejo: inserting a script tag should work, it's the standard technique...if it's not you're doing something wrong
[19:10:03] <Jester831> error*
[19:10:24] <misterm> Jester831: yea, it looks like an error with the plugin
[19:10:32] <misterm> Jester831: are you loading the scripts in the right order?
[19:10:59] <abjorn> @delinquentme: use something like for(var name in s) { // dostuff }
[19:11:10] <Jester831> misterm: yup, jquery > fancybox > buildabrand
[19:11:21] <ejo> misterm: even if another script tag is already there?  I simply used $.after to insert it.
[19:11:59] <misterm> Jester831: doesn't look like it to me
[19:12:16] <ejo> maybe I should just insert an empty script tag with src="(URL for the desired script bit on my server)" and let the browser fire another request, instead of doing the request in ajax?
[19:12:41] <misterm> ejo: depends on what you're doing
[19:12:58] <Jester831> misterm: hit refresh with chrome network monitoring on, they're listing and load correctly there
[19:12:59] <ejo> yeah, there are different consequences for each approach in terms of document ready etc.
[19:13:56] <ejo> misterm: I would do the latter, but I want to execute some statements as a success callback, that's why I was AJAXing in the body of the script rather than just setting a tag with a src attribute and letting the browser do it.
[19:14:32] <ejo> If I set an empty tag and let the browser load the js from the src attrib, how do I make sure my next statements execute only after that is successful?  Just add another document.ready?
[19:16:25] <ejo> oh, i could probably bind to the <script> element's load event
[19:18:44] <Assimilater> ajpiano: well i essentially modeled the demo's code but it's not quite behaving the same, i'm wondering would this code not work on a (slightly) older version of ui? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/sv7Rb/4/
[19:19:19] <misterm> Jester831: it's most likely a conflict with the WP JS, version conflict, problem with noConflict
[19:20:00] <misterm> Jester831: clearly for whatever reason fancybox isn't getting initialized properly, so I'd try taking out things until it works to track down the issue
[19:20:23] <Jester831> misterm: I guess that just doesn't make sense, being as I'm using that same config with the default wp js/noconflict in another site
[19:20:38] <Jester831> kk
[19:21:23] <misterm> ejo: depends on what you mean
[19:22:18] <ajpiano> Assimilater: i'm pretty that any complex menu based stuff like that demo relies on 1.9
[19:22:54] <Assimilater> a huh...is it released?
[19:23:11] <bfred> how do I find the scroll height of an overflow:scroll element?
[19:23:14] <Assimilater> or should i just use those bookmarks? :P
[19:24:06] <ajpiano> Assimilater: it's not released
[19:24:22] <ajpiano> using the git verison of 1.9 in production might not be the best idea :p
[19:24:34] <Assimilater> ajpiano: what then should I use?
[19:24:53] <ajpiano> you could try using one of the milestone releases
[19:24:54] <ajpiano> OR
[19:25:02] <ajpiano> like, if you are happy with the way it's working
[19:25:07] <ajpiano> save it and keep it and source it locally
[19:25:11] <ajpiano> cause the git version will change with every commit
[19:25:22] <ajpiano> and then you never know if some bug gets introduced
[19:25:26] <Assimilater> well i didn't mean pop the bookmarks in my head element
[19:25:28] <bfred> bfred: scrollWidth
[19:25:30] <Assimilater> i meant download the current bookmark
[19:25:48] <Assimilater> is ther a milestone with menus?
[19:25:59] <delinquentme> insert string onto end of array in jquery?
[19:26:34] <misterm> delinquentme: you don't need jQuery for that
[19:28:24] <Assimilater> ajpiano: i guess i could include just popup.js and menu.js (i need both and only those, right?)
[19:28:34] <ajpiano> Assimilater, you'll have to test
[19:28:50] <ajpiano> it could rely on changes to widget/core in 1.9
[19:28:50] <ejo> This is odd... I can append arbitrary text to <head> or <body> but I can't append <script type="text/javascript" src="/foo.com/somescript.js"></script>.  When I try to do the latter, no such item shows up in the DOM.
[19:28:54] <ajpiano> that won't be there if you're on 1.8
[19:29:10] <Jester831> ahhh figured it out misterm:: another dev overrode my header.php, and did loaded 1.3.1 js
[19:29:15] <Jester831> jquery
[19:29:51] <ejo> oh wait... it's because document.createElement('script') did not create an open/close tag pair, only the open.  So what I tried to insert into the DOM was a syntax error.
[19:30:06] <ejo> i mean was an open element without a close so it's ignored
[19:30:09] <misterm> Jester831: yea, I figured it was something like that
[19:30:25] <delinquentme> inserting html inside a specific div?
[19:30:30] <delinquentme> .append is after
[19:30:43] <Jester831> kind of irritates me, being as the first thing i did when updating was fix loading, and remove that crap code left behind for me
[19:32:52] <Assimilater> error: this.hoverable is undefined
[19:32:59] <Assimilater> ajpiano: hoverable...what would that be in?
[19:33:05] <ajpiano> not sure
[19:33:20] <ajpiano> Assimilater: you're going down a deep dark route trying to mush together bleeding edge code together with 1.8
[19:33:40] <Assimilater> ajpiano: you're probably right...what's the closest milestone? :P
[19:34:14] <ajpiano> ?g jQuery UI Milestone 5
[19:34:16] <bot-t> ajpiano, jQuery UI 1.9 Milestone 5  Tabs Redesign  jQuery UI Blog - http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/05/jquery-ui-1-9-milestone-5-tabs-redesign/
[19:34:51] <ajpiano> Assimilater, there may have been some nice menu fixes in there since then
[19:34:52] <Assimilater> oooh
[19:34:58] <ajpiano> bt
[19:35:02] <ajpiano> YMMV, give it a shot
[19:35:33] <Assimilater> YMMV?
[19:35:44] <bobdobbs> Hey guys. I'm  having trouble with my ajax function again. I'm getting data back from the server, but my success callback isn't firing. This makes me sad.
[19:35:56] <bobdobbs> This is the function: http://www.pastie.org/2229556
[19:36:17] <bobdobbs> This is the page that with the script: http://gogos.sunil.co.nz/contact.html
[19:36:26] <bobdobbs> What am I doing wrong?
[19:36:42] <bobdobbs> The php script is returning data,and running to it's end without errors.
[19:36:46] <misterm> bobdobbs: how does one recreate the error
[19:37:16] <bobdobbs> Well, after you hit 'send', there should be an alert.
[19:37:38] <bobdobbs> at the moment, the callback just throws up an alert if we get to it.
[19:37:59] <misterm> bobdobbs: protip - don't use a minified jQuery for development
[19:38:03] <bobdobbs> if I understand correctly, that callback should be called as long as anything comes back
[19:38:11] <bobdobbs> misterm: ahh.
[19:38:19] <ajpiano> Assimilater, your mileage may vary
[19:38:33] <misterm> bobdobbs: mind you I'm not saying that has anything to do with your problem, but it sure makes figuring things out much easier
[19:38:41] <bobdobbs> right
[19:39:15] <bobdobbs> mind you, in the past I've had things not work with the minified version that work with the expanded version.
[19:39:29] <bobdobbs> only once though.
[19:39:43] <bobdobbs> I'll swap that out anyway.
[19:41:00] <bobdobbs> ... and it looks like you or someone is testing that form... I'm seeing mail come in.
[19:41:05] <misterm> bobdobbs: yea, right now jQuery is throwing an error, so that's probably whats stopping the success callback
[19:41:20] <bobdobbs> ok
[19:41:25] <bobdobbs> how did you see it?
[19:41:35] <misterm> bobdobbs: in the console
[19:41:38] <bobdobbs> I'm not seeing any come up in the firebug console.
[19:41:41] <bobdobbs> interesting...
[19:41:51] <bobdobbs> you using fb or something else?
[19:41:54] <misterm> chrome
[19:42:02] <bobdobbs> interesting
[19:42:12] <bobdobbs> I'll do the swap, and see what we can see...
[19:42:48] <misterm> bobdobbs: I get an error in FF as well
[19:43:09] <bobdobbs> ok
[19:43:17] <bobdobbs> even more interesting
[19:43:28] <misterm> bobdobbs: do you have FF set up to show errors?
[19:44:39] <jaypitidi> I'm using jquery hash change plugin and it is adding a hash to every link on my page. is there a way to make it so it will only add the hash for my ajax script?
[19:45:09] <bobdobbs> misterm: yes. set to see all errors. I can see errors from missing image file for that page.
[19:45:21] <bobdobbs> Might be a problem with my version. checking...
[19:45:37] <misterm> bobdobbs: the appropriate settings in about:config and everything?
[19:45:37] <ejo> misterm: I think my problem might just be firefox and firebug.  I can insert <script type="text/javascript" src="/mysite/myscript.js"></script> in head or body and the browser gets it and loads the script from the src URL.  But the text of the loaded new script does not show up in the DOM anywhere.
[19:45:40] <bobdobbs> oh. I'm a dumbass...
[19:45:48] <bobdobbs> I'm using a 1.8.05b
[19:45:53] <bobdobbs> Im' using a beta. shame
[19:46:13] <ejo> in other words it works, but the desired side effect of having the script's text be there where I can read it in View Source or a debugger just doesn't happen.
[19:47:19] <ejo> Am I trying to do something that is just not supported?  I'm only trying to alter the current page so that more javascript is in it, as if the additional script had been loaded at original page load, except waiting to load this stuff until the user takes certain actions, so that the initial page load won't be as heavy on js.
[19:47:41] <ejo> seems like a pretty common case.
[19:47:48] <ejo> Again, i'm getting what i want, the late loaded script works...
[19:47:55] <ejo> it's just a bummer that it doesn't appear in the DOM for inspection.
[19:49:19] <bobdobbs> misterm: ok, after swapping out the jquery scripts, on my local version, the callback now fires.
[19:49:48] <bobdobbs> misterm: remote works now too.
[19:50:57] <Assimilater> ajpiano: ya it seems there are some issues with the mile stone when it comes to menus :S http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/sv7Rb/7/
[19:51:16] <ajpiano> yeah,
[19:51:22] <ajpiano> from here though
[19:51:31] <ajpiano> you're good to probably pull in newer versions of the components you need from git
[19:51:36] <ajpiano> if you're happy with how it works
[19:52:07] <Assimilater> i am partly concerned about reverse compatability with the rest of my site, but i can't imagine any changes terribly serious....
[19:52:50] <bobdobbs> misterm: locally, I just did another swap. I'm pulling the latest minified version from the google cdn, and the callback is still firing.
[19:53:21] <bobdobbs> misterm: thanks for the help :)
[19:53:40] <Assimilater> ajpiano: if i include the same min and also include the components will they override nicely? or will i get redefinition errors?
[19:55:01] <ajpiano> um, just straight up overriding the components after should be fine
[19:55:09] <ajpiano> but it's redundant
[19:55:10] <ajpiano> :
[19:55:11] <ajpiano> :/
[19:55:27] <Assimilater> ya.....
[19:55:33] <Assimilater> i guess it's component by component then...
[19:59:50] <justicefries> ohai
[20:00:20] <Assimilater> ugg, still not quite getting it to behave :S http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/sv7Rb/8/
[20:11:40] <jaypitidi> how can I limit the hashchange plugin to only work on the ajax portion of my website?
[20:18:27] <Assimilater> ajpiano: this works: http://callserver.dyndns.biz:81/jquery-ui-1.9m5/demos/menu/contextmenu.html but this doesn't http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/sv7Rb/9/ help? lol
[20:32:06] <delinquentme> so im doing jquery magic .. and im using a selector .. however .. instead of adding a color to the object with XXX selector (a class)  .. i just want to change the color of the class

[20:54:03] <ghufran> hi. i am making an ajax call which is binded to submit of a form. The whole thing is inside document.ready. It works if i load that form directly but not if the form is loaded through ajax. any ideas/solutions?
[20:54:38] <tbranyen> ?delegate @ ghufran
[20:54:38] <bot-t> ghufran, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[20:56:33] <ghufran> tbranyen, so i should get rid of the document.ready block altogether and do this outside that context, right?
[21:00:06] <Assimilater> it seems ajpiano is no longer with me atm, can anyone else here help me with a couple things? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/sv7Rb/14/ one) I tried migrating some of my code to use toggle as opposed to click and i'm wanting to get it to toggle on-load, but the button doesn't display if i use $(obj).toggle({data}).toggle() two) I'm trying to get a menu to appear when the second button gets clicked, but the commented code breaks down
[21:09:04] <Assimilater> it's a ghost channel in here......
[21:09:25] <rroelofs> Assimilator:  toggle is just a fancy click
[21:09:41] <Assimilater> rroelofs: so how can i get it to load the initial value?
[21:09:50] <rroelofs> add .click() after your toggle, before your next()
[21:09:55] <vladikoff> i would not want to live in the same town with someone called "Assimilater" D:
[21:10:05] <Assimilater> vladikoff: lol? why?
[21:10:08] <vladikoff> >_>
[21:10:11] <Assimilater> rroelofs: oh...i see...
[21:10:13] <rroelofs> The Borg is always with us :-)
[21:10:15] <KingDosser> Hey Guys
[21:10:59] <Assimilater> yay problem one of two solved
[21:11:16] <Assimilater> problem two: http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/sv7Rb/15/ that menu is behaving in ways i don't understand
[21:11:21] <vladikoff> hey KingDosser!
[21:11:40] <KingDosser> How's it going vladikoff :)
[21:11:53] <vladikoff> KingDosser, not bad! you?
[21:11:56] <Assimilater> the weird part is this behaves as i want: http://callserver.dyndns.biz:81/jquery-ui-1.9m5/demos/menu/contextmenu.html
[21:12:08] <Assimilater> and i'm using the same js (at least i think i am...)
[21:12:42] <KingDosser> vladikoff: Good thanks :)
[21:12:50] <vladikoff> noice!
[21:17:05] <Assimilater> well this fixes the alignment but why aren't they clickable? is it because they're not anchors? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/sv7Rb/16/
[21:19:52] <K1ng> anyone here used western union?
[21:19:52] <bot-t> (93 hours 30 mins ago) <coldhead> tell K1ng please change your quit message to something less offensive
[21:19:56] <rroelofs> Assimilator, I haven't used the ui menu widget before, but I would guess that making them links would fix it.

[21:38:10] <Assimilater> <script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.core.js"></script><script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.position.js"></script><script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.widget.js"></script><script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.menu.js"></script><script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.button.js"></script><script src="../../ui/jquery.ui.popup.js"></script>
[21:38:19] <Assimilater> and put in <script src="../../ui/jquery-ui.js"></script> it dies
[21:38:54] <Assimilater> that ui folder came straight from the development bundle on milestone 5: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/05/jquery-ui-1-9-milestone-5-tabs-redesign/
[21:39:13] <Assimilater> is it possible that jquery-ui.js doesn't have all the components in it?
[21:45:28] <Assimilater> ghost town again....
[21:48:36] <innociv> Maybe if we had 10 more people t'd be active
[21:48:52] <innociv> And yes it's posible that you don't have all the componants of jquery ui.  Use the google url
[21:51:04] <vladikoff> Assimilater, what was your current/second issue again?
[21:51:53] <encompass> Hi guys, is there a way to remove a dom object and place it in a variable?
[21:52:12] <encompass> Or would it be better to just hide the data and somehow reference to it?
[21:52:59] <systemfault> encompass: check .detach
[21:53:19] <systemfault> and .remove
[21:53:29] <systemfault> depending if the node has associated data
[21:54:48] <Assimilater> sorry didn't see the flag
[21:55:05] <Assimilater> vladikoff: the issue is one that the list popping in is getting button stylings for some weird reason
[21:55:14] <Assimilater> the second issue that i'm hoping is the reason for the issue
[21:55:22] <Assimilater> if i modify this page: http://callserver.dyndns.biz:81/jquery-ui-1.9m5/demos/menu/contextmenu.html#Utrecht
[21:55:35] <Assimilater> to use the complete ui js instead of the components
[21:55:42] <Assimilater> you can't click on the list items
[21:55:46] <encompass> systemfault: yup, detach was exactly what I was looking for, I assume I can put that in an array?
[21:55:48] <Assimilater> or rather it doesn't do anything
[21:56:05] <encompass> The detached object can be put in an array correct?
[21:56:28] <systemfault> AFAIK, yes.
[21:56:41] <vladikoff> Assimilater, hmmm
[21:57:03] <Assimilater> innociv: does google have milestone 5?
[21:57:21] <innociv> I'm not sure.
[21:57:29] <innociv> I use an old version anyway
[21:57:38] <Assimilater> innociv: which means you don't have access to menus
[21:57:49] <innociv> Menus eh?  Sounds neat
[21:57:50] <Assimilater> which is what i'm trying to make work :P
[21:59:18] <Assimilater> ajpiano: you're always watching? part of me hopes that's not true because if it is it means you're ignoring me right now... (at which point i'd rather know >:| )
[22:01:05] <innociv> Na I think ajpiano is the type to be more blunt.
[22:02:00] <Assimilater> ya me too
[22:02:26] <Assimilater> he also seems to have a sense of humor about it }:)
[22:03:21] <gnrlbzik> i have a container with the list if items
[22:03:25] <gnrlbzik> it has set height
[22:03:50] <gnrlbzik> with scroll bar
[22:04:07] <gnrlbzik> i need to scroll to specific list item within
[22:05:01] <Assimilater> i'm about to the point to post it on forums, and go to sleep
[22:05:04] <Assimilater> it's late :S
[22:12:50] <Assimilater> if anyone find a fix, i'll be immensly grateful: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/having-problems-using-menu-from-milestone-5
[22:12:56] <Assimilater> g'night all
[22:13:02] <encompass> gn
[22:14:20] <innociv> Er.  Can I do something like OuterClass.prototype.InnerClass.prototype.icFunction = function(){};   If that did work, the context of "this" would be innerClass.  Is there any way to go "back" to get the "this" of OuterClass?
[22:21:11] <gnrlbzik> That post?
[22:22:05] <innociv> ?
[22:22:23] <gnrlbzik> i thought Assimilater was going to post a link
[22:22:30] <gnrlbzik> oh well
[22:22:38] <gnrlbzik> then let me ask again
[22:22:45] <encompass> he must be famished
[22:22:58] <gnrlbzik> i have a container with overflow
[22:23:03] <gnrlbzik> producing scrollbar
[22:23:22] <gnrlbzik> and i need to find a position of specific element within
[22:23:28] <gnrlbzik> so i can set .scrollTop
[22:23:46] <gnrlbzik> if i use .position()
[22:24:04] <gnrlbzik> the top value
[22:24:47] <gnrlbzik> depends on where that element part of the visible area or outside of it
[22:25:14] <gnrlbzik> is there a way to pint point to specific position relative to scroll bar?
[22:27:15] <TK_> i need help desparately
[22:27:32] <TK_> anybody here to help me?
[22:27:42] <encompass> TK_ just ask, we all need help :)
[22:27:42] <gnrlbzik> just ask question
[22:27:49] <anissaa> i have image name from database, now how can i add a column with this image in  jqgrid??
[22:28:42] <TK_> i can loop animation
[22:28:48] <TK_> can't
[22:29:09] <encompass> TK_: is it a gif or what is it?
[22:29:49] <TK_> no, it,s css div color animation
[22:30:03] <gnrlbzik> there is callback function
[22:30:08] <TK_> trying to use animate()
[22:30:15] <gnrlbzik> that is executed at the end of the animation
[22:30:28] <gnrlbzik> why dont you call animation again with it?
[22:30:34] <encompass> can you post what you curretnly have?  Does it currently animate?
[22:30:49] <TK_> yes
[22:30:56] <TK_> { 	$color = ['#FFFF00', '#006600', '#0000CC', '#FFFFFF', '#FF6600']; 	$seq = ['#seq1', '#seq2', '#seq3', '#seq4', '#seq5']; 	for(var i = 1; i < 6; i++) 	{ 		 		//for(var j = 0; i < 5; i++) 		//{  			$('$seq'+i).animate({ backgroundColor: $color[i-1] }, 1500).animate({ backgroundColor: "#333333" }, 2000); 			 		//}     } }
[22:31:27] <TK_> i was trying to use for loop
[22:31:29] <encompass> apperently you are not used to IRC... please paste your stuff in someplace else than here.
[22:31:45] <gnrlbzik> and past link to here
[22:31:54] <TK_> yes i am new to irc
[22:32:12] <gnrlbzik> alright, any how, i need help to : )
[22:32:21] <gnrlbzik> i have container with scrollbar
[22:32:29] <encompass> TK_: go here... http://jsfiddle.net and paste your code there then give the link here.
[22:32:34] <gnrlbzik> and i have list inside
[22:33:29] <encompass> TK_: my guess is that your looping correctly, but really realy fast, so the animations happen all at once.
[22:33:39] <gnrlbzik> i need to set scroll bar position to view a specific element inside.
[22:33:56] <gnrlbzik> whats the proper way to find position of the element
[22:34:05] <gnrlbzik> so that i can set scrollTop()
[22:34:50] <encompass> TK_: you could try to wait or something with setInterval and then break out of that when it's done. But I personally have never dealt with that issue.
[22:35:36] <gnrlbzik> any ideas?
[22:36:01] <TK_> encompass_ i am new to jQuery, this is my first codeing
[22:36:16] <encompass> are you new to javascript as well?
[22:36:23] <TK_> hmm
[22:36:56] <gnrlbzik> if i use offset() i get relative position to viewable area of element
[22:39:11] <encompass> TK_: Take a look at this...http://kirupa.com/developer/actionscript/setinterval.htm he is using setInterval and clearInterval... they may do better for you
[22:40:43] <encompass> I am out, see you guys
[22:41:37] <gnrlbzik> bye
[22:42:15] <gnrlbzik> any one not yet a sleep
[22:49:53] <TK_> encompass_ r u there
[22:53:05] <gnrlbzik> he is gone
