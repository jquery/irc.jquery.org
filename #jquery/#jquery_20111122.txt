[00:02:20] <Xotix> No one knows a xml validaton against xsd made with js. Don't like to code the validation against an xsd by myself :P
[00:03:32] <new2net> is there some reason  $( "#w4ecb56e68bf04" ).datepicker({date-format: 'yy-mm-dd'});  would not be valid? (specifically the options string)
[00:04:05] <Cork> date-format isn't a valid key
[00:04:22] <Cork> 'date-format' or remove the -
[00:04:45] <new2net> GAH!!! thank you Cork... ^_^ you sniped it
[00:04:54] <Cork> (not sure that datepicker expects)
[00:07:11] <new2net> hehehe :3 you called it... Another question if I may. In my previous JS experience I noticed arrays ending with a comma (EX:   .datepicker({dateformat: 'yy-mm-dd',});       ) seemed to have issues in IE, is it correct to remove the comma or does it not matter?
[00:07:43] <Cork> new2net: thats an object and not an array
[00:07:53] <Cork> but ya its correct ie will puke over trailing commas
[00:08:06] <Cork> so make sure to always remove them
[00:08:16] <Cork> (both in arrays and objects)
[00:08:42] <new2net> Cork. right. OK... I am using this library and wanted to contact the author (a PHP JqueryUI wrapper) with my updates for his missing widgets, and I happened to notice he didn't remove the trailing comma from the widget's optionString.
[00:09:38] <Cork> uh, you mean he left trailing commas?
[00:09:45] <Cork> cause the code can't fix those errors
[00:10:26] <Cork> cause its the ie parser that halts if they exist, so the code never runs
[00:36:45] <Murugaratham> is there any benchmark on the significance of performance gain by compressing/packing js files?
[00:37:05] <Spadeski> Murugaratham: comes in oen file instead of using multiple libraries idk
[00:37:25] <Murugaratham> if it's only 1 file, is it really worth compressing
[00:41:39] <Guest13124> info.push($("#" + info[0] + "_in").text);
[00:41:43] <Guest13124> why won't this work?
[00:42:01] <new2net> Cork, right. every widget with options would have their options looking like this ({option1: 1, option2: 2,})  with a trailing comma.
[00:42:02] <Cork> .text() not .text
[00:42:07] <Cork> Guest13124: ^
[00:42:14] <Guest13124> info[0] exists, and contains 11-9-2011
[00:42:29] <poppiez> anything similar to jgestures out there but with more events? need stuff like doubletap, touchcancel etc.
[00:42:34] <Cork> new2net: ya, that will error in ie
[00:43:19] <Cork> Murugaratham: theres quite a lot of paramters to take into account
[00:43:59] <Cork> Murugaratham: when your talking about transfer speed, you don't care about number of characters, but number of tcp packages
[00:44:35] <Cork> Murugaratham: so sometimes just losing one character can have quite big inpacts

[01:14:24] <slite> I have a cookie set on domain level, and its sent to the server on new requests, but its not listet if i log document.cookie. Any idea how to show it/remove it using jquery?
[01:16:24] <eightfold> should this: $('.pxField:contains("800"):.pxField:not("1280")').('.PreviewSizes:last-child').hide();
[01:17:07] <eightfold> hide    .PreviewSizes:last-child   if     .pxField   contains "800" and does not contain "1280"?
[01:17:59] <eightfold> i can hide something like parent().parent().hide();     but i can't seem to hide        a specific class, like .PreviewSizes
[01:18:13] <aaronmcadam> contains is for dom objects
[01:18:27] <aaronmcadam> oh woops
[01:18:30] <aaronmcadam> .contains
[01:18:33] <aaronmcadam> ignore meee
[01:19:01] <aaronmcadam> eightfold: you're :not should have a :contains
[01:20:18] <eightfold> aaronmcadam: .pxField:not:contains ?
[01:20:24] <aaronmcadam> somebody bump the topic
[01:20:31] <aaronmcadam> no u need to bracket them
[01:20:37] <aaronmcadam> or use .not
[01:21:08] <aaronmcadam> eightfold, you should use .filter() instead of trying to chain selectors like that
[01:21:17] <aaronmcadam> ?filter @ eightfold
[01:21:17] <bot-t> eightfold, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[01:21:49] <eightfold> aaronmcadam: hm, ok. but it seems to work. it's just that i can't target and hide .PreviewSizes. just need a quick fix for now. but i'll read up on filters
[01:22:08] <aaronmcadam> quick fixes never get refactored
[01:22:12] <aaronmcadam> tht code sucks :D
[01:22:28] <aaronmcadam> then add a .find infront
[01:22:34] <aaronmcadam> or preview
[01:22:36] <aaronmcadam> of*
[01:23:15] <eightfold> aaronmcadam: i trie d .find  before  .('.PreviewSizes:last-child').hide();    but didn't work either
[01:23:23] <aaronmcadam> eightfold: jsfiddle
[01:23:25] <aaronmcadam> your code
[01:23:28] <eightfold> aaronmcadam: okay

[01:45:08] <robertstuttaford> does anyone know of a jquery plugin which does this scrolling behaviour on https://www.simple.com/? with the nav at the top that updates as you scroll
[01:53:33] <yan_nick> hey guys, can you tell me why this doesn't work ? http://jsfiddle.net/ptZWJ/2/
[01:55:12] <Cork> yan_nick: do you have the plugin loaded in your page?
[01:56:17] <yan_nick> Cork: yes it's included you can see that the h2 is getting a font size from the script
[01:56:18] <yan_nick> https://raw.github.com/davatron5000/FitText.js/master/jquery.fittext.js
[01:56:31] <yan_nick> style="font-size:32.903450348309px" or sth like that
[01:57:09] <Cork> yan_nick: no i can't not in the snippet you posted
[01:57:19] <Cork> thats why i asked
[01:57:23] <Cork> ok, so what isn't working?
[01:58:17] <yan_nick> Cork: the resize
[01:58:26] <yan_nick> Cork: i thought it fit the text to the full width and height
[01:58:37] <yan_nick> Cork: view-source:http://fiddle.jshell.net/ptZWJ/1/show/light/
[01:58:45] <Cork> you mean stretch the text?
[01:59:23] <Cork> yan_nick: '$("h2").fitText is not a function'
[02:00:42] <yan_nick> Cork: yeah, any idea?
[02:01:04] <Cork> "[2011-11-22 10:58:44] <Cork> you mean stretch the text?"
[02:01:20] <yan_nick> Cork: yes
[02:01:33] <Cork> you can't stretch text like that
[02:01:38] <Cork> css can't do it
[02:01:54] <yan_nick> Cork: but fittext.js does that
[02:02:21] <Cork> no it adjusts the elements font size so the estimated width fit on screen
[02:02:37] <Cork> http://fittextjs.com/img/fittext_screens.png
[02:02:38] <yan_nick> Cork: but why then view-source:http://fiddle.jshell.net/ptZWJ/2/show/light/ doesn't work
[02:02:48] <yan_nick> Cork: that's right
[02:02:50] <yan_nick> i need that
[02:03:06] <eightfold> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/abmTH/
[02:03:21] <Cork> yan_nick: uh... you just said you wanted to stretch the font height and size
[02:03:31] <Cork> the size sets the height
[02:03:38] <Cork> its proportional
[02:03:39] <yan_nick> Cork: the width
[02:05:00] <Guest13124> width: 90%; height: auto; in css?
[02:05:20] <Guest13124> that'd stretch/keep the aspect ratio of the image in css
[02:05:26] <Cork> that't only effect the element dimentions
[02:05:29] <Cork> not the text size
[02:05:39] <Guest13124> oh, i thought it was about an image.
[02:05:42] <Cork> that'll
[02:06:24] <XMan2012> my captcha is working on one site but another site, it doesnt work.... i am using the same code(100%) but... it always loads first "Error!" on the captcha image
[02:06:30] <Guest13124> font-size: 90%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; then?, not sure if it's going to work
[02:06:40] <XMan2012> can you please have a look on these examples...
[02:06:46] <XMan2012> http://samirayousefi.com/test/   Here is works
[02:06:46] <yamahaalex37> is there a simple setsaturation effect in jquery
[02:06:55] <Cork> Guest13124: ya, but it won't stretch the text size, it will still keep its proportions
[02:06:57] <yamahaalex37> i want all menu thumbnails grey or darker until hovered
[02:07:03] <XMan2012> http://metodum.com/test/index.php  ... here it doesnt work
[02:07:37] <Guest13124> Cork: font-stretch: expanded; ?
[02:07:42] <Cork> Guest13124: and you can't just set a percent on size, if you want the word to take the full width of the element
[02:07:54] <Cork> Guest13124: it still only stretch a bit
[02:08:08] <Cork> its styling hinging for the browser
[02:08:09] <XMan2012> Do i need special sitting for this captcha ?
[02:08:44] <Cork> yamahaalex37: saturation, you mean to calculate the new rgb value?=
[02:08:47] <Cork> -=
[02:09:50] <yamahaalex37> nah, i was looking to have black thumnails until hovered Cork
[02:09:56] <yamahaalex37> but i suppose fadeTo will do alright
[02:10:21] <Cork> yamahaalex37: you can't set that type of saturation at all in css
[02:10:35] <Cork> yamahaalex37: you would have to add elements ontop or a color behind
[02:11:29] <yamahaalex37> oh ok
[02:11:40] <yamahaalex37> i think fadeto is better for what i needed anyway
[02:12:02] <Cork> yamahaalex37: what can do it is embeded svg, but ya, its better to fade

[02:21:27] <clockwize> hey guys, how would i find a node with data-id="blah" on it?
[02:23:19] <Cork> clockwize: you would have to do an attribute search through the dom
[02:23:32] <Cork> clockwize: its often better to add a class or id to the element
[02:24:11] <Cork> $('*[data-id="blak"]') (the star can be skipped, but this ilustrates what the selector will do)
[02:25:52] <deleted> hello, i'm creating a wordpress plugin & i got a problem with the .load() by jquery, someone can help me?

[02:27:11] <deleted> huhu ok, just i have to pass object (or take the $wpdb var on my .phtml called) with .load() . Is it possible?
[02:28:27] <Cork> deleted: you would have to echo the php value so that the js can get hold of it, but ya you acn
[02:28:28] <Cork> *can
[02:29:50] <deleted> so don't pass the var with the $_GET Method ( url.phtml?var=value
[02:30:01] <deleted> ?
[02:30:32] <deleted> i don't realy understand you answer
[02:30:38] <Cork> deleted: uh.. do you want to putput the value in the javascrip request or find a value the script sends?
[02:30:44] <Cork> *output
[02:31:44] <Cork> that is, in what end do you have the data you want to get, and where do you want to get it
[02:32:43] <deleted> i got a var ($wpdb => Wordpress DB) on my action called by jQuery. I have to pass it to an other phtml file called by the .load()
[02:32:49] <deleted> (pastebin if you want)
[02:33:22] <Cork> is the $wpdb a jquery element or what?
[02:33:27] <Cork> is it a php variable?
[02:33:46] <deleted> $wpdb is a PHP var
[02:34:26] <Cork> ok so you want the php variable passed to js and then sent through another request
[02:34:51] <Cork> deleted: then you first have to pass the variable to the javascript or echo it into the .load url string
[02:34:59] <mazzachre> When selecting '#board fieldset' will <form id="board"><fieldset>...<fieldset> (the inner fieldset) not be selected? And how do I make all of them selected?
[02:35:18] <Cork> deleted: cause right now you only have it on the server side, so the client doens't know about it
[02:35:32] <solsTiCe> hi. normally CAche-Control and ETag headers are only needed to get a If-None-Match being send by the browser to get a 304. when I try to use ifModified: true, on a ajax get with jquery I never see the If-None-Match header being sent. why ? is this a bug ? in the doc, I see "jquery 1.4 check for etag header too". does that mean later version do not ?
[02:35:37] <Cork> deleted: and there by can't pass it anywhere
[02:35:41] <mazzachre> Oh it does... sry, something else is wrong...
[02:36:06] <deleted> Cork: yes that's the problem, but i don't realy understand how you want to echo it
[02:37:21] <Cork> deleted: if you generate the code .load('<your-url>?wdpd=<?php echo $wdpb; ?>
[02:37:36] <Cork> deleted: but this only works if what you have there isn't a class, like a database connection class
[02:37:54] <Cork> deleted: cause then it can't be recreated by the reseavin script
[02:38:41] <Cork> deleted: just so i have it sait, you have to remember js and server is a network connection appart, everything sent is text so only what can be passed as text can get from server to client and back
[02:38:50] <Cork> sait==said
[02:39:53] <lilmikey> hi
[02:40:52] <lilmikey> in a for loop, how do I set add a pause before the next instance starts?
[02:41:10] <Cork> lilmikey: you don't that would freez the page
[02:41:23] <Cork> you iterate over the list with setTimeout
[02:41:24] <lilmikey> I meant a delay
[02:41:31] <Cork> same thing
[02:41:48] <deleted> Cork: i know it, this is not realy the problem, it's realy hard to explain :s , i have 3 files. First is the WordPress controller witch is feeding my datas. Second is my JS file who call my controller for getting the data & call (.load()) my Third with the data
[02:42:08] <deleted> Cork: my problem is i need a WordPress var in the Third
[02:42:26] <Cork> deleted: what kind of data is in the variable?
[02:42:56] <donCams> deleted, is that for a wordpress plugin/theme?
[02:43:12] <deleted> Cork: http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb
[02:43:22] <deleted> donCams: yep, it's for a plugin
[02:43:35] <Cork> deleted: ugg thats a mysql connection
[02:43:40] <Cork> you can't pass that over js
[02:43:45] <Cork> not posible
[02:43:47] <donCams> deleted, you need wp_ajax and/or wp_ajax_nopriv
[02:43:48] <deleted> on my third file, i haven't got the $wpdb
[02:43:55] <clockwize> is there a better way than $(".blah").length > 0
[02:44:11] <deleted> this is plugin ?
[02:44:18] <Cork> clockwize: nope thats the best way to see if the class exists
[02:44:19] <deleted> what they do ?
[02:44:31] <lilmikey> i dont get it.
[02:44:32] <deleted> are they doing?*
[02:45:07] <clockwize> why is there not a $(".blah").exists()?
[02:45:17] <lilmikey> 	for (var i = 0; i < 45; i++){
[02:45:18] <lilmikey> 		setTimeout(function(){
[02:45:18] <lilmikey> 			$("#element").rotate(i);
[02:45:18] <lilmikey> 		}, 2000);
[02:45:18] <lilmikey> 	};
[02:45:18] <Cork> clockwize: cause it would be slower
[02:45:26] <lilmikey> whats wrong here?
[02:45:29] <clockwize> no it wouldn't
[02:45:37] <Cork> lilmikey: doesn't work like that, and don't paste code in the channel
[02:45:41] <donCams> deleted, they are action hooks. better ask #wordpress
[02:45:46] <lilmikey> sorry.

[02:48:54] <deleted> donCams: there is no "wp_ajax_nopriv" plugin :s

[02:49:35] <donCams> deleted, that's not a plugin :(
[02:50:14] <Cork> lilmikey: a warning though, that code is async so code around it will have to take that into account
[02:50:21] <deleted> huhu, lol ... ok i haven't understand, this is hook ?
[02:53:58] <solsTiCe> I don't understand. previoulsy ajax query were ached and I had to specify cache:false to bypass. now I want them to be cached and there are not by defautl. and even ith cache:true...
[02:54:30] <lilmikey> Cork: so it's not possible to do it with a for loop?
[02:54:59] <Cork> lilmikey: it is, but the interface would hung until the loop is done
[02:55:16] <Cork> some browsers won't even render changes you've done
[02:55:29] <lilmikey> ok.
[02:55:51] <Cork> + until the loop ends

What else to use? Anyone uses something that works?
[02:56:22] <Cork> lilmikey: callback for complete?
[02:56:26] <lilmikey> yes
[02:56:34] <Cork> before the return; in the if statement

[03:05:08] <MariusKarthaus> I need to replace part of an object P by 'overlaying' a similar structured object O. This is what I want: http://jsfiddle.net/XAHSV/1/ does anyone know the correct operation for this?
[03:06:22] <Nicke\> Aamir: Hmm I use it on mouseout event and it works one time then the effect disappears.
[03:08:00] <Aamir> MariusKarthaus: you already have p.b.b2 = { x:1,y:2 }. Don't know but see ?extend
[03:08:01] <bot-t> MariusKarthaus, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[03:08:15] <Aamir> ?demo @Nicke\
[03:08:16] <bot-t> Nicke\, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[03:09:09] <yamahaalex37> so if i wanted to change the <span> text within a div
[03:09:13] <yamahaalex37> would this be the correct selector
[03:09:15] <yamahaalex37> $(#divMenuTitle).children(#span).text("Software");
[03:09:56] <MariusKarthaus> Aamir: if I use extend p.b1 will disappear
[03:09:58] <Aamir> yamahaalex37:  $('#divMenuTitle span').text('Software') or  use .find
[03:10:15] <MariusKarthaus> Aamir: and I want to keep b1, just replace b2
[03:11:22] <tempel> ?append
[03:11:22] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[03:12:58] <Aamir> MariusKarthaus:  try console.log( $.extend({}, p.b, o.b) )
[03:13:26] <yamahaalex37> thank you that worked Aamir
[03:13:35] <MariusKarthaus> yes the problem is that I do not know the name of 'b' or how deep the trail will be.
[03:13:44] <yamahaalex37> but if i use mouseover to change a div, why doesnt it change back when im no longer hovering
[03:13:53] <yamahaalex37> i shouldnt have to change it back each time, if it's just a mouseover
[03:14:20] <Aamir> MariusKarthaus:  in .extend read about the first param [deep]
[03:14:58] <Nicke\> Aamir: http://xail.se/dizvild/ <- So, the problem is when you hover over fast multipile times it get stuck and then disappears.
[03:16:00] <Aamir> Nicke\:  worked for me :/
[03:16:32] <Nicke\> Try again
[03:18:54] <Aamir> try $('.dropdown', this).slideUp(0).stop();  instead of $('.dropdown', this).hide().stop();
[03:19:30] <Aamir> sorry   $('.dropdown', this).stop().slideUp(0)
[03:19:40] <MariusKarthaus> Aamir: Let me explain what I'm trying to do. I have an object (p) that has a  non-recursive directory structure.  the object o has the directory structure of a subdir (could be many levels deep) of a single directory found somewhere in p. The 'keys' in o specify the path. the corresponding subdirectory content in P needs to be replaced by the information found in o
[03:20:45] <Aamir> MariusKarthaus:  you need recursive loop and compare keys and values of two objects :|
[03:21:36] <MariusKarthaus> Aamir: ok i'll code that then, I was hoping there might be a nice way to do this using jquery thank you
[03:21:56] <Nicke\> Aamir: nvm, got it working with this: $(this).find('.dropdown').delay(200).stop(true, true).slideDown(300);
[03:21:58] <Aamir> MariusKarthaus: yes there be a better way I am sure :)
[03:22:16] <Aamir> Nicke\: cool :)
[03:25:15] <yamahaalex37> why should i have to reset span text each time mouseout
[03:25:18] <yamahaalex37> if im only setting it for mouseover
[03:25:53] <yamahaalex37> is there a simple way on mouseout to revert to default
[03:28:42] <mazzachre> Anyone using a color selector with a new version of jquery?
[03:29:23] <mazzachre> The EXColor one from modcoders does not work with jquery 1.5.2
[03:39:38] <Nicke\> What should I use as the option in the "effect( effect, [options], [speed], [callback] )"?
[03:39:54] <Nicke\> it's jquery ui

[03:51:48] <Kingsy> can someone help me debug a fault in IE ?
[03:51:56] <ravenzz> ?load @ ramkam2011
[03:51:57] <bot-t> ramkam2011, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[03:54:05] <Kingsy> check this out --> http://www.giftedjewelry.com/57824.html <-- you can see the similar items what is supposed to be a jcarousel is totally messed up in IE, if you look at that page in firefox and chrome its fine..
[03:54:44] <Kingsy> I also have another version of the website (different domain) but the same code and in IE it works.. I can paste the link for that if someone wants to see.. I am totally stumpted. I have tried removing all js from the head that doesnt have anything to do with the jcarousel.. I have also tried comparing the files from the broken site and the working site and they are the same as far as I can
[03:54:44] <Kingsy> see.
[03:55:39] <ramkam2011> ravenzz: nope. doesn't work. the event is not triggered. Code: html+= '<object width="1000px" height="1500px" type="application/pdf" data="'+pdfUrl+'" id="objpdf"></object>';
[03:55:39] <ramkam2011> 	$('#pdf').html(html).load(function() { console.log('loaded'); });;
[03:57:04] <ramkam2011> nor:  $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#pdf').html(html); $('#objpdf').load(function() { console.log('loaded'); });
[03:59:36] <ramkam2011> i'll use a ajax call on base64 data, gives more control on the loading
[03:59:57] <ramkam2011> anyone here btw ?
[04:00:28] <EdwardIII> hey
[04:01:49] <ravenzz> mh
[04:02:08] <ramkam2011> hello :-)
[04:02:09] <EdwardIII> so i'm pulling in a dialog using ajax with obj.load.dialog(...
[04:02:22] <ravenzz> ramkam2011 $('#pdf').hide(); $(window).load(function(){ $('#pdf').show(); });
[04:02:24] <ravenzz> i guess
[04:02:55] <EdwardIII> should i be able to access the elements that are getting pulled in from the other page?
[04:03:00] <subdesign> hi
[04:03:11] <EdwardIII> i mean something like this: https://gist.github.com/1385509
[04:03:14] <Kingsy> ravenzz: fancy helping me with spot the difference? something is off here, and I cant find it
[04:03:35] <ravenzz> wait I didn't read your Q
[04:03:38] <EdwardIII> #current_resource_id exists, but in the html doc that getting pulled in
[04:03:41] <ramkam2011> ravenzz: the event load is not triggered
[04:03:43] <subdesign> if I want to refresh a page with a plugin's callback function, how to do that in general?
[04:04:01] <ramkam2011> safari shit :-)
[04:04:09] <ramkam2011> (good shit btw)
[04:04:11] <ravenzz> ?g preload pdf jquery @ ramkam2011
[04:04:12] <bot-t> ramkam2011, jQuery Image Preload Plugin - http://www.farinspace.com/jquery-image-preload-plugin/
[04:04:13] <Kingsy> ravenzz: np, in IE take a look at http://www.giftedjewelry.com/57824.html   <-- broken jcarousel in iE         http://www.qpjewellers.com/17824.html  <--- working jcarousel in iE
[04:04:55] <Kingsy> ravenzz - both sites work however in FF and chrome
[04:05:19] <ravenzz> are you talking about the Similar items carousel?
[04:05:26] <Kingsy> ravenzz: yeah
[04:05:28] <ramkam2011> ravenzz: thx
[04:05:38] <ravenzz> oh right let me check
[04:06:08] <Kingsy> ravenzz: np, heh you will see on giftedjewelry its like 1000's of pixels high.. totally messed up
[04:06:27] <Chib> subdesign: window.location.reload()
[04:06:46] <subdesign> oh , i forgot window.
[04:06:49] <subdesign> trying
[04:06:54] <Kingsy> ravenzz: what makes it more confusing is the fact that qpjewellers has exactly the same code as far as I can see
[04:07:44] <lcof> scrollbar does not show up with jScrollPane : http://jsfiddle.net/zYpy9/4/, help greatly appreciated
[04:08:05] <EdwardIII> i guess if i can see it in inspect element then it must be in the DOM, so i should be able to access it via jquery
[04:08:17] * EdwardIII scratches head
[04:08:34] <subdesign> Chib: thx working
[04:10:09] <Kingsy> ravenzz: what do you think? confusing huh?
[04:12:10] <ravenzz> eheh yep
[04:12:25] <ravenzz> anyway I notice that IE calculates a wrong width/height for each LI
[04:12:44] <Kingsy> ravenzz: yeah that is literally the only difference I can spot
[04:12:57] <ravenzz> but I don't know why
[04:13:11] <Kingsy> and those are generated by js.. so if the code is the same the output should be
[04:13:25] <Kingsy> its insane
[04:13:33] <ravenzz> it is man
[04:13:52] <ravenzz> I hate those plugins. Whom make calculations
[04:14:24] <Kingsy> I honestly don't know what to do
[04:14:37] <ravenzz> why don't you try to replace that carousel
[04:14:52] <Kingsy> ravenzz: what do you mean?
[04:14:57] <ravenzz> it should be done in minutes
[04:15:02] <ravenzz> use another plugin
[04:15:20] <Kingsy> ah right, use a different plugin all together you mean?
[04:15:24] <ravenzz> yes
[04:15:35] <ravenzz> it is hard to debug on IE :[
[04:15:42] <Kingsy> yeah I guess I could but how annoying is that.. I really want to find out why its doing it
[04:15:46] <Cork> it is
[04:16:14] <ravenzz> and actually I should prepare the launch
[04:16:15] <ravenzz> :P
[04:17:22] <Kingsy> Cork: you got any ideas?
[04:17:43] <Cork> Kingsy: whats the question?=
[04:18:02] <Kingsy> IE take a look at http://www.giftedjewelry.com/57824.html   <-- broken jcarousel in iE         http://www.qpjewellers.com/17824.html  <--- working jcarousel in iE <-- code is the same
[04:18:24] <Kingsy> Cork: under SIMILAR ITEMS
[04:19:46] <EdwardIII> ho hum
[04:21:32] <kollapse> Hello. I have this here piece of code that blocks all user input except some keys. How do I make it allow Ctrl+A, Alt+F4 shortcuts and such ?
[04:21:48] <Kingsy> Cork: any thoughts?
[04:21:54] <Double_Rainbow> hello everyone
[04:22:34] <Double_Rainbow> i have a string like this: " '\r\n\r\n380\r\n\r\n'" however, when i use trim() on it, i still get the same string:  '\r\n\r\n380\r\n\r\n'
[04:22:41] <Double_Rainbow> any advise?
[04:22:51] <Double_Rainbow> woops
[04:22:56] <Double_Rainbow> wrong #channel
[04:23:34] <Jon47> kollapse, try typing them  and in your intercept code check what event code gets passed (it might be different on different systems?) and then allow those specific events to pass through
[04:24:09] <NARKOZ> anybody knows why this alerts the same ids.length on every checkin? http://pastie.org/2903001
[04:24:35] <ramkam2011> ravenzz: is there a size limit to the $.get or $.post response ?
[04:25:06] <kollapse> Jon47: I can't, for the keydown event, for example Ctrl is 17 and A is 65, yet Ctrl+A will be 65 as well because the last typed character is A.
[04:25:39] <Jon47> so you need to store the last TWO typed characters
[04:25:43] <Jon47> and check them both?
[04:26:16] <Jon47> or some very confusing use of mousedown/up to figure out when 17 is pressed by 65 is still down..
[04:26:25] <kollapse> No, because if I type Ctrl and after 10 seconds A, it will interpret it as Ctrl+A
[04:26:32] <kollapse> Which it clearly isn't.
[04:26:36] <Jon47> read my last message
[04:26:43] <kollapse> You mean keydown/up ?
[04:26:48] <Jon47> oh yeah
[04:26:50] <Jon47> sorry
[04:27:03] <kollapse> Confusing -> good word. :)
[04:27:31] <Jon47> what's your intention with this code?
[04:27:50] <Jon47> why not just trap the specific events you're interested in, rather than trapping everything and mkaing a huge list of exceptions
[04:28:11] <Cork> Kingsy: ugg your using multible frameworks...
[04:28:13] <EdwardIII> hrm, dialog.focus() triggers every time a dialog is clicked, but dialog.open() triggers before the elements inside the dialog exist. i want something in between?
[04:28:20] <Cork> Kingsy: but no not really
[04:28:39] <Cork> Kingsy: try pushing it through jslint and see what it throws at you
[04:29:25] <kollapse> Jon47: Well I am trying to prevent the user from typing anything in a text box other than numbers and periods. But I also don't want to remove standard functionality like Tab, arrow keys, delete and backspace.
[04:29:43] <kollapse> And preventing Ctrl+A, Alt-F4, F5, Ctrl+W is not good.
[04:29:55] <Jon47> yeah i see that..
[04:31:09] <ramkam2011> any workarounds on $.get() response size limitation
[04:31:15] <Kingsy> Cork - sorry what is jslint?
[04:32:58] <EdwardIII> grr
[04:33:21] <EdwardIII> jquery dialogs are pulling my pein
[04:33:24] <Kingsy> Cork: the online tool that you paste code into does give me anything useful at all.. it says stuff like "no space between this and that" <-- if you get me
[04:34:41] <Kingsy> Cork: but I don't think its the code in the plugin cos the exact same code/plugin is used on the other working site (qpjewellers)
[04:35:14] <Cork> Kingsy: ie is kinky with variable names and commas and a few other things
[04:35:19] <Cork> so it can still be the code
[04:36:18] <Kingsy> Cork: how can it be the code if qpjewellers (working) and giftjewelry (not working) have exactly the same jquery.jcarousel.min.js file ?
[04:36:40] <Cork> Kingsy: the js in the webpage can differ
[04:36:41] <ramkam2011> help ... how to workaround the response size limitation of jquery ajax call ?
[04:37:06] <Cork> response size limit...
[04:37:14] <Cork> thats the xhr response size limit
[04:37:29] <Cork> your sendin enormus amount of data...
[04:37:48] <ramkam2011> yes
[04:37:48] <Pathogen-X> Limit the record size of the replies...
[04:37:53] <Kingsy> Cork: so, what exactly am I pasting into http://www.jslint.com/ <--? the contents of jquery.jcarousel.min.js I assume?
[04:37:56] <ramkam2011> but i had the problem a long time ago
[04:38:03] <Pathogen-X> Likewise.
[04:38:17] <Cork> Kingsy: no the js you have inline in the page
[04:38:36] <ramkam2011> and if remember right, the limitation comes from jquery, not from xhr (it works fine if i do basic code without jquery)
[04:39:24] <EdwardIII> i guess what i really want is something like $(modalBox).load(this.href).dialog({
[04:39:27] <EdwardIII> oops!
[04:39:33] <Anime> hmm, i had some <img> inside <li>'s which worked fine with some jquery code. i just changed those to be a <li> with a sprite sheet. it was $("div ul li img") and now i changed to $("div ul li") and it doesn't work anymore, any ideas?
[04:39:34] <Kingsy> Cork: where? I don't have any js inline that has anything to do with the jcarousel
[04:39:58] <Cork> Kingsy: if an earlier code block fails to parse the parser stops
[04:40:10] <Cork> Kingsy: so it doens't matter if its related as long as its run before
[04:40:11] <EdwardIII> like this: https://gist.github.com/1385580 # but where 'ready' is a real method heh
[04:40:52] <Kingsy> Cork: so if an eariler code block runs and fails, it could cause the jcarousel to run but run faulty?
[04:41:15] <Cork> ramkam2011: jquery just wraps the xhr object and passes on the response data, it adds no limitation what so ever
[04:41:19] <EdwardIII> #current_resource_id doesn't become available until *after* the dialog has finished loading it's contents....
[04:41:25] <Kingsy> Cork: because the jcarousel is running its just coming back with the wrong widths and heightsa
[04:41:25] <EdwardIII> any tips you absolute jquery pros?
[04:41:54] <Cork> Kingsy: it can cause function to not exist if the parser halts yes
[04:42:14] <Cork> Kingsy: it all depends on where the error exists
[04:42:26] <ramkam2011> Cork: ok, i'll try. Is there a plugin to send data in chunks ?
[04:42:43] <Cork> ramkam2011: uh, thats controlled by the server
[04:43:09] <Cork> ramkam2011: but if you hit the max size of the http body, you will have performance problems
[04:43:17] <Cork> better think over what you send
[04:45:12] <EdwardIII> hrm maybe i should do a seperate ajax callback for the i.d.... but c'mon, what a palavar
[04:45:40] <Pathogen-X> ramkan2011:  I got around it by just using limit statements on the SQL backend and sending the responses in chunks that way.  Limit 0,100; limit 101, 200, etc.
[04:46:31] <eightfold> can someone take a look at:
[04:46:31] <eightfold> http://jsfiddle.net/abmTH/2/
[04:46:40] <ramkam2011> Cork: planning to load the data in localStorage then use it when needed
[04:47:02] <eightfold> i want to hide .PreviewSizes based on what pxField says
[04:47:14] <Cork> ramkam2011: send a few records at a time instead then
[04:47:20] <ramkam2011> Cork: working on mobile webapps, and i want to optimise the amount of data that is transfered
[04:47:25] <Cork> ramkam2011: like 50-100
[04:47:58] <ramkam2011> Pathogen-x: yups, cheers
[04:48:37] <ramkam2011> Cork: acutally i'm loading pdf data in base64 ...
[04:49:49] <Cork> ouch
[04:50:00] <ramkam2011> lol
[04:50:16] <Cork> ramkam2011: think about that the amount of data your sending will have to be stored multible times in memory before its saved
[04:50:24] <Cork> so you don't want to have too big a blocks
[04:50:34] <Cork> cause you will exast the memory on the mobile device
[04:50:51] <ramkam2011> pdftk chunks the pdf file by pages
[04:50:56] <ramkam2011> then i display the page
[04:51:40] <ramkam2011> it's in the memory limitations of the mobile device, i haven't noticed slowdowns
[04:54:58] <SargoDarya_> Hey guys, any idea on how I could correct an elements position in jquery uis draggable bind?
[04:56:28] <beasty_> hi all
[04:56:45] <beasty_> i have this issue with a $.get()
[04:56:59] <beasty_> and a $.each()
[04:57:40] <Xotix> I have a <img> and would like to apply it a upload function. so if you click on the img, you get an upload. how can i do that? I could trigger a hidden form but maybe, there is something better?
[04:57:52] <Benn> eightfold:
[04:57:54] <Benn> http://jsfiddle.net/j4KGR/
[04:57:59] <beasty_> http://pastebin.com/UYfZYrPA
[04:57:59] <Benn> try something like that?
[04:58:05] <beasty_> that's the source
[04:58:29] <Benn> to be able to link the right Preview Div to the right pxField div
[04:58:33] <Cork> Xotix: no you can't easily submit files uploads without a full form
[04:58:44] <beasty_> Xotix: http://www.uploadify.com/demos/
[04:59:03] <beasty_> where did sean disapear to ?
[04:59:45] <ruby_on_tails> i got a bunch of css stuff to display in a grid, each of them is a compelte css piece and has its own css styles, now the problem is when they are put in a grid the css may conflict, is there anyway to apply each of their css properties to them only ? maybe using a parent lock or something ?
[04:59:53] <Xotix> Cork, so i could create a hidden form. make a function which triggers it (should be possible i hope somehow) and apply that on the img?
[05:00:01] <Xotix> beasty_: thanks i'll take a look at it
[05:00:49] <Cork> Xotix: the point of my comment is that file uploads is a mess right now
[05:00:53] <ruby_on_tails> can i force the css of a particular set of elements to apply only to children of a particular div ?
[05:01:01] <eightfold> Benn: thanks, but sorry it wont work. what i'm trying to do: if div.pxField DOES contain "800" and DOES NOT contain 1280, hide div.previewSizes. sorry for the capitals, just there for readability :)
[05:01:08] <ruby_on_tails> i cant edit the CSS because its a gallery wiht css coming as inputs from users

[05:01:37] <ramkam2011> Cork: is there a way to detect if the data of an <object> is loaded ?
[05:01:55] <Xotix> Cork, yes, and im asking whats the nicest solution for my case :) So using a hidden form with a trigger function is good, bad? :)
[05:01:56] <Cork> ramkam2011: normally, but nor always
[05:01:56] <ruby_on_tails> Cork is famous, mhmmm...
[05:02:17] <Cork> ramkam2011: it normally triggers an load event see ?.load

[05:02:48] <Cork> Xotix: it will reload the page, and might not be what you want
[05:02:51] <ramkam2011> Cork: yes, tried .load() doesn't work on : <object type="application/pdf" data="'+pdfUrl+'" id="objpdf"></object>

[05:03:35] <Xotix> just use ajax together with it, somehow. hmm i'm gonna read a bit. thanks
[05:03:42] <ramkam2011> ruby: i do :)
[05:03:45] <ruby_on_tails> anyone knows the answer to my question ?
[05:03:50] <Cork> ramkam2011: not sure you can load pdfs in object...
[05:04:02] <ramkam2011> Cork: yes you can :-)
[05:04:10] <Cork> ramkam2011: browsers normally needs plugins for that
[05:04:21] <ramkam2011> in safari, the plugin is builtin
[05:04:35] <ramkam2011> a bit tricky to set the correct layout, but it works
[05:04:36] <Cork> isn't that a bit one sided?
[05:04:43] <Cork> building for one specific browser?
[05:04:57] <ramkam2011> it is
[05:05:13] <Kingsy> I gave up on that fault.. it was doing my head in..
[05:05:17] <ramkam2011> mobile safari doesn't handle flash
[05:05:37] <Cork> ramkam2011: i never agree to do things like that my self
[05:05:42] <Cork> its just bad for the net
[05:05:55] <ramkam2011> Cork, i'd be happy to discuss a viable solution then
[05:05:55] <Cork> it brings ie4-6 back all over again
[05:06:10] <EdwardIII> ie6 brings tears to my eyes
[05:06:25] <ramkam2011> I need to display a pdf file inline, whatever the device
[05:06:54] <Cork> don't sniff if the browser can handle it, and if it doesn't tirgger it to start the needed app
[05:06:58] <ramkam2011> converting the pdf in other formats doesn't work too well
[05:07:04] <Cork> *don't; sniff
[05:07:25] <Cork> ramkam2011: i don't know of any os that can't handle pdf
[05:07:29] <ramkam2011> sniff ? (sorry i'm french)
[05:07:44] <Cork> heck my old nokia phone from 2005 can do it
[05:07:49] <lilmikey> I would like to store a variable for the clients session. It will be used in jquery. I build my site with html5. should I use the native html5 function, or jquery? is there any difference?
[05:07:55] <Cork> ramkam2011: feature test
[05:08:05] <Cork> see if the browser understands application/pdf
[05:08:07] <ramkam2011> Cork: i need to display the pdf inline on a webpage so that i can have my own controls, like, tagging, bookmarking, etc
[05:08:12] <Cork> if not then load it as a new tab
[05:08:27] <EdwardIII> anyone got a tip on how to get data from inside a dialog box after it loads? open even actually gets called before the contents of the dialog box are loaded!
[05:08:34] <Cork> ramkam2011: you could always use pdf.js :)
[05:08:41] <Cork> ?g pdj.js

[05:08:52] <ramkam2011> Cork: i've seen that and another one, it's still in early dev
[05:08:58] <Cork> i know
[05:09:11] <Cork> it still works quite well though
[05:09:14] <SargoDarya_> Any way to change the position of an draggable object in mid drag?
[05:09:22] <ramkam2011> Cork: meanwhile ... i'm trying to find workarounds
[05:09:32] <ramkam2011> Cork: are you working on pdf.js ?
[05:10:06] <lilmikey> SargoDarya - maybe using Timers?
[05:10:08] <Cork> ramkam2011: nope but i'm following it
[05:10:11] <EdwardIII> if i bind to the focus event i can get data but then it's triggered everytime the visitor clicks somewhere in the dialog box
[05:10:14] <ramkam2011> Cork: ok i'll give it a try then
[05:10:16] <Cork> ramkam2011: i like the idea a lot
[05:10:26] <ramkam2011> Cork: yes, it would be great
[05:10:30] <lilmikey> I would like to store a variable for the clients session. It will be used in jquery. I build my site with html5. should I use the native html5 function, or jquery? is there any difference?
[05:10:35] <SargoDarya_> lilmikey: no.
[05:10:41] <ramkam2011> Cork: but seems mission impossible to me (performance limitations ?)
[05:11:03] <Cork> ramkam2011: pdf isn't that complicated to read
[05:11:11] <Cork> ramkam2011: and it uses canvas to render
[05:11:18] <Cork> so its farly fast
[05:11:27] <SargoDarya_> It should be possible to change it through $(this).data('draggable').offset.click.top which I don't really get because it seems to be relative to the document instead of the parent element
[05:12:26] <lilmikey> yea
[05:12:38] <lilmikey> use position() instead
[05:12:46] <lilmikey> it's relative to the parent
[05:13:01] <ramkam2011> Cork: i'll give it a try, i'm running out of options to be net friendly :)
[05:13:06] <SargoDarya_> it doesn't work like that in jquery ui draggable. That's the problem
[05:13:14] <lilmikey> (instead of offset)
[05:14:03] <SargoDarya_> Yea, I know. I tried that already but that doesn't seem to work
[05:14:18] <SargoDarya_> weird...
[05:14:28] <SargoDarya_> I try something different, thanks anyways
[05:14:44] <EdwardIII> heh i can't be the only person who's ever wanted to do this
[05:15:29] <SargoDarya_> Edward: What's the exact problem?
[05:17:29] <EdwardIII> SargoDarya_: i want to get a value from a hidden field from a dialog box which gets it's content via .load()
[05:17:32] <EdwardIII> SargoDarya_: https://gist.github.com/1385509/cd755982588139098fa068a5cecab3db72bb4dc3
[05:17:34] <ramkam2011> Cork: hum, pdf.js, not yet heh ... http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/web/viewer.html   shows nothing on safari, just blank pages
[05:17:37] <EdwardIII> tried using promise() but no luck
[05:18:01] <Cork> ramkam2011: pitty, well then your "screwd" i guess...
[05:18:14] <Cork> ramkam2011: i'm glad you tried at least
[05:18:29] <EdwardIII> SargoDarya_: also tried using dialog's builtin events 'open' and 'create' but they both seem to trigger before the content actually loads
[05:18:54] <EdwardIII> i tried guessing at 'ready' but no joy
[05:19:17] <EdwardIII> i guess the load is happening asynchrounously so i somehow need to be notified when it finishes
[05:19:45] <kollapse> pdf.js fails on Opera, apparently it has JavaScript errors (DOMException)
[05:20:09] <kollapse> It only works on Chrome, on FF it shows me seriously messed up fonts.
[05:23:14] <Anime> i had <div><ul><li><img> and this $("div ul li img").mouseover, it worked. i removed the <img> and made all the <li>'s background from a sprite sheet and changed the jquery to $("div ul li").mouseover. it doesn't work anymore. anyone knows why's that?
[05:23:58] <Jon47> Anime - the theory is sound, can we see an example?
[05:24:37] <Anime> let me put it on fiddle, a sec
[05:25:12] <lilmikey> whats the best way of storing a simple variable to use in jquery for the session?
[05:26:23] <kollapse> lilmikey: Cookies ?
[05:26:35] <lilmikey> jquery cookie plugin?
[05:26:45] <kollapse> Sure
[05:27:16] <kollapse> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2010/09/jquery-cookies-getsetdelete-plugin.html
[05:27:40] <kollapse> Note: If you don't specify the expiry date the cookie is trashed when you close the browser. So this can act as a session variable.
[05:27:41] <Cork> lilmikey: your reloading the page?
[05:27:52] <lilmikey> yea
[05:28:04] <lilmikey> I only want it for the session.
[05:28:18] <lilmikey> it will be used for navigation
[05:28:28] <Cork> lilmikey: then ya session cookie or in the servers session store
[05:28:45] <lilmikey> i prefer client side i think
[05:29:00] <Cork> session cookies can live for very long though
[05:29:00] <kollapse> Safer on server-side.
[05:29:03] <kollapse> Less tampering.
[05:29:20] <Cork> its sent to the client anyway, so doesn't really matter
[05:29:33] <blackspotwiggins> lilmikey, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage#sessionStorage
[05:29:48] <kollapse> Cork: I mean server-side session variables, not cookies.
[05:30:06] <Cork> kollapse: i know, but as the data is used in js, its not much difference
[05:30:11] <Anime> Jon47: http://jsfiddle.net/gSyaa/
[05:30:36] <lilmikey> blackspotwiggins: I wanted to use sessionStorage but it's not supported in ie7
[05:31:00] <Cork> lilmikey: theres another option query params
[05:31:01] <blackspotwiggins> fuck ie7
[05:31:11] <blackspotwiggins> dont support it
[05:31:14] <Cork> if its not a lot of data that is
[05:31:25] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: few can do that
[05:31:58] <EdwardIII> SargoDarya_: ah, cracked it - load() takes a callback, i used that instead, brilliant!
[05:32:03] <blackspotwiggins> it's less than 15% usage
[05:32:22] <Cork> cross the globa ya
[05:32:38] <Cork> but its much more for some areas, and some type of visitors
[05:32:40] <blackspotwiggins> actually 5%
[05:32:43] <beasty_> anyone that can tell me why my second $.each() isn't working ? http://pastebin.com/UYfZYrPA
[05:32:59] <kollapse> Anime: Why are you using 'top' and 'left' if you don't have absolute positioning ?
[05:33:03] <blackspotwiggins> http://www.netmarketshare.com/report.aspx?qprid=3&qpaf=&qpcustom=Microsoft+Internet+Explorer+7.0&qpcustomb=0
[05:33:30] <Anime> i actually do, its just a part of the whole thing
[05:34:17] <Cork> beasty_: you shouldn't use array when your creating objects
[05:34:33] <Cork> use {}
[05:34:39] <lilmikey> why the cookie plugins dont show up on jquery.com anymore?
[05:34:39] <Jon47> Anime you're missing a close paren on this line : tip.html($(this).html(e.target.id);
[05:34:47] <Jon47> read the js console, it tells you where the errors are
[05:35:13] <kollapse> Anime: You can reduce that code to this - http://jsfiddle.net/gSyaa/3/
[05:35:14] <Anime> i closed it and ran, seems like it didnt save
[05:35:32] <Jon47> you gotta hit "update" to get a new short link
[05:35:42] <Anime> oh.
[05:35:44] <kollapse> Or Ctrl+S
[05:37:26] <Jon47> jsfiddle seems to be borked right now
[05:37:37] <kollapse> Myeah... weak servers :/
[05:37:49] <Anime> yep lol, still didn't load /3/
[05:38:38] <kollapse> It seems like another case of "the server in my bedroom".
[05:38:59] <Jon47> i think it handles a shitload of traffic
[05:39:02] <Jon47> and it's a free service
[05:39:08] <Jon47> so i'm not gonna complain
[05:40:02] <kollapse> Anime: Here - http://jsfiddle.net/gSyaa/4/
[05:42:44] <Jon47> this line is baffling: tip.html($(this).html(e.target.id);
[05:43:05] <Jon47> even if you add the closing paren.. why would you want to change the html of the li you just moused over?
[05:43:07] <atdiehm> so I was looking at docs and got some conflicting info... if I want to fire an event when either a page is closed, or browsed away from.... unload() seems like my function, but the docs say browsers don't implement it all the same.... is there a "best" way to make sure a function gets called when a page is navigated away-from / closed....
[05:43:46] <Cork> Jon47: not really it changes the currents elements content and replaces whats in tip with the current element
[05:44:21] <Jon47> you don't think that's weird?
[05:44:50] <kollapse> Of course it's weird, You don't replace an element's html with another element.
[05:45:01] <kollapse> At most you replace an element's html with another's html.
[05:45:04] <kollapse> But not with the element itself.
[05:45:05] <ramkam2011> Cork: pdf.js and "all browsers compliant" ...  hum, Uint8Array and Uint32Array aren't implemented yet in safari ;-)
[05:45:26] <ramkam2011> Nice day to the jquery team, always a pleasure to drop by here
[05:46:32] <Anime> yeah, it worked
[05:46:43] <Anime> my bad about that line :-|
[05:47:00] <Anime> thanks jon, kollapse
[05:49:37] <Jon47> np Anime
[06:12:16] <Robbington> Hey, can anyone tell me why this would break my code? $('.more-views-side-scroller:first-child').hide();

[06:14:53] <Robbington> Sorry, should have said the class selector is an Ul
[06:15:35] <Robbington> So I'm jst trying to get the first li in a ul
[06:16:34] <kollapse> Robbington: Try $('.more-views-side-scroller li:first-child').hide(); ?

[06:27:12] <mazzachre> Is there a color picker that works on IE? I have used wheelcolorpicker http://www.jar2.net/projects/jquery-wheelcolorpicker/demo but it seems to not do anything on IE machines
[06:29:07] <lilmikey> has anyone used the animated rotation plugin?
[06:29:51] <lilmikey> http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/
[06:29:54] <lilmikey> that one
[06:30:58] <Zelest> won't a regular .animate() do?
[06:31:23] <VeXii> not if he wants IE support
[06:32:01] <Zelest> does IE support HTML3 yet? :P
[06:32:14] <Zelest> if you use a broken client, expect a broken web.
[06:32:26] <VeXii> did html3 (css 2.1) have rotate?
[06:32:47] <blackspotwiggins> how are css2.1 and html3 related
[06:33:10] <Zelest> it's not.
[06:33:20] <VeXii> css 2.1 is about youre best wish if youre supporting html3 browsers
[06:33:24] <Zelest> I more meant that IE is just so far behind every other browser :P
[06:33:40] <blackspotwiggins> ie9 seems decent
[06:33:44] <blackspotwiggins> 10 even more so
[06:33:51] <Zelest> indeed, and they do have rotate
[06:33:57] <blackspotwiggins> their upgrade schedule leaves much to be desired tho
[06:33:58] <Zelest> hence, IE is supported by my book :)
[06:34:26] <lilmikey> actually, that plugin isnt
[06:34:32] <lilmikey> working in IE
[06:34:33] <lilmikey> :)
[06:34:43] <lilmikey> for anything but images
[06:34:49] <lilmikey> and i want to rotate divs.
[06:34:51] <blackspotwiggins> why would you want to give ie peasants rotation anyways
[06:35:01] <VeXii> so do more then 50% of IE users use IE9? i doubt it
[06:35:05] <lilmikey> you know, customers.
[06:35:10] <blackspotwiggins> let them see the content in  plainest way possible
[06:35:18] <blackspotwiggins> you are the reason ie persists then..
[06:35:45] <lilmikey> oh come on!
[06:35:49] <seutje> VeXii: u can rotate using a matrix filter in IE
[06:35:58] <lilmikey> anyways, i wont get it working.
[06:36:00] <VeXii> yeap
[06:36:01] <HardPhuck> how can i get absolute position of a deeply nested element, relative to the window
[06:36:04] <seutje> ?g DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Matrix
[06:36:05] <bot-t> seutje, Matrix Filter - MSDN - Microsoft - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533014(v=vs.85).aspx
[06:36:15] <VeXii> hentence why he is using a support plugin
[06:36:28] <blackspotwiggins> yea use chrome frame plugin
[06:36:29] <lilmikey> how should i animate the rotation?
[06:36:31] <blackspotwiggins> problem solved
[06:36:35] <lilmikey> is there some css3 code
[06:36:37] <seutje> lilmikey: very carefully
[06:36:58] <lilmikey> i saw some code on html5rocks slides
[06:37:03] <lilmikey> but they dont even work in mozilla
[06:37:06] <seutje> HardPhuck: offset?
[06:37:18] <HardPhuck> not working, I get offset().left = 0
[06:37:34] <HardPhuck> but it's not 0, because the page is centered horizontally
[06:37:57] <seutje> ?paste
[06:37:57] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:38:47] <HardPhuck> this is the code: console.log($('div.tempshade').offset().left);
[06:38:57] <HardPhuck> http://schuberthdev.gforcesm.com/categories/motorcycle/support/owners-manual/
[06:39:00] <HardPhuck> this is the site
[06:39:10] <HardPhuck> if you hover over the main menu next to logo
[06:39:17] <SargoDarya_> Any idea if I can overload the plus operator for my object?
[06:39:32] <seutje> lilmikey: FF>=4 supports animations afaik
[06:39:33] <HardPhuck> the white background should scroll across the whole width, and I want to reposition it
[06:39:48] <min|dvir|us_> Hi. I cannot position a jQuery UI dialog displayed within an iframe in Safari and Chrome.
[06:39:53] <lilmikey> seutje yes but I mean rotation
[06:39:58] <lilmikey> animated rotation
[06:40:04] <min|dvir|us_> Any thoughts?
[06:40:55] <min|dvir|us_> Seems like http://forum.jquery.com/topic/dialog-position-not-honored-within-an-iframe-in-chrome is having the same problem.
[06:41:49] <seutje> lilmikey: works for me!
[06:42:05] <lilmikey> ok, will try that
[06:45:19] <seutje> lilmikey: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/JXTzY/
[06:46:38] <kollapse> Hmm. Considering the fact that elements with ids should be unique, will "$('#id')[0].id" be faster to execute than "$('#id').attr('id')" ?
[06:46:51] <seutje> HardPhuck: u kidding me, right?
[06:46:59] <blackspotwiggins> i think "id" will be fastest
[06:47:04] <seutje> HardPhuck: the element ur targetting is display: none;
[06:47:05] <blackspotwiggins> as you are selecting by id in the first place
[06:47:19] <HardPhuck> seutje: my bad, sorry, missed that, anyway I've fixed it
[06:47:22] <HardPhuck> thanx
[06:47:41] <kollapse> blackspotwiggins: Also, in a jQuery loop, "this.id" looks much nicer than "$(this).attr('id')"
[06:48:09] <lilmikey> seutje that looks cool, thanks
[06:48:12] <blackspotwiggins> you didnt understand
[06:48:37] <blackspotwiggins> in the case of $("#asd")[0].id vs $("#asd").attr("id") just "asd" is always fastest
[06:49:49] <kollapse> blackspotwiggins: I did understand, just stated that this.id will look nicer than all those paranthesis.

[06:51:52] <seutje> Robbington: I take it you meant $('li').data('events'), yesh?
[06:52:10] <Xotix> i need a good jquery plugin for ajax image upload with a good documentation.

[06:55:27] <min|dvir|us_> The Facebook canvas.
[06:55:28] <DualDetroit> They talk about not being tied to the DOM, but it seems it is quite tied to the DOM with the views.
[06:55:29] <seutje> min|dvir|us_: ur not trying to style it from the top frame, are u?
[06:55:34] <min|dvir|us_> No.
[06:55:38] <beasty_> bah anyone up for helping a array noob p:
[06:55:41] <min|dvir|us_> I would if I could.
[06:56:04] <seutje> too bad it doesn't work like that :P
[06:56:16] <beasty_> http://pastebin.com/UYfZYrPA this is what i tried
[06:56:18] <beasty_> but failed
[06:56:28] <Robbington> Seutje, Here is a pastebin of where I have go to. http://pastebin.com/u6EtXHuq
[06:56:30] <lilmikey> seutje: how would you do that using jquery animation?
[06:56:33] <min|dvir|us_> seutje: it's a browser issue.
[06:56:34] <DualDetroit> beasty_: Underscore.js saved my life when I was a streetcoder.
[06:56:38] <min|dvir|us_> Works reliably in IE and Firefox.
[06:56:42] <lilmikey> i mean the rotation
[06:56:45] <min|dvir|us_> Works on my Chrome, nobody else's.
[06:56:53] <min|dvir|us_> Doesn't work on Safari.
[06:56:59] <seutje> mighty odd
[06:57:06] <Robbington> What I am looking to do is on click event remove the li and add it to the bottom of the list, to simulate a scroller. But the li has a click event on it that I need to get as well
[06:57:23] <min|dvir|us_> Remember, it's an iframe containing a jQuery UI Dialog containing an iframe.
[06:57:33] <min|dvir|us_> Might that have something to do with it?
[06:57:46] <seutje> lilmikey: like any other animation? .animate('property', 'value') ?
[06:57:55] <lilmikey> ye
[06:58:40] <g0rd0n> i am having a problem with sorting in datatables.... basically i want to sort by name, but people starting for example with Ü will come after Z instead of after U... anyone knows how to change that behavior?
[06:59:06] <min|dvir|us_> Is Safari typically more restrictive against XSS?
[06:59:43] <seutje> beasty_: think ur looking for an object instead of an array
[07:00:06] <Xotix> does uploadify use flash?
[07:00:24] <DualDetroit> Mah momma writes JavaScript to pay da bills and my daddy is in da crib for dealin. :(
[07:01:03] <beasty_> seutje: can you give me some pointers ?
[07:01:21] <DualDetroit> The crackhome I live in is a mess, I need to learn backbone.js
[07:01:27] <min|dvir|us_> beasty_: Just replace [] with {}.
[07:01:40] <min|dvir|us_> (Only where you have exactly [].)
[07:01:40] <polorix> Just looked at this channel, first think i read..DualDetroit's stuff hahaha
[07:03:24] <seutje> beasty_: http://pastebin.com/vaw730MU

[07:09:49] <mazzachre> Help! I can't seem to make this UI work... I need a color selector and a font selector, they are both there on the jqueryUI theme roller page, but I can't use them...
[07:10:38] <lilmikey> seutje: thats chrome of course
[07:11:13] <mazzachre> I have used the color picker widgets I can find in plugins on jquery, but the one that actually works, does not work in IE
[07:14:48] <lilmikey> seutje: did you take a look at it?
[07:15:18] <xivix> What's y'all's response to the guys over in ##javascript that say jQuery is terrible?
[07:16:25] <Chib> @_@
[07:16:28] <Chib> is my response
[07:16:54] <hashar> hello there :)
[07:16:58] <xivix> Chib: That's a different facial expression in every font.
[07:17:05] <hashar> is there anyone from the TestSwarm team around ?  :-)
[07:17:32] <kollapse> $('##javascript').some().say($('framework:any').isBad());
[07:19:45] <lilmikey> Can any1 tell me why this doesn't work? its animated -webkit-transform http://jsfiddle.net/Sfgwk/
[07:20:06] <lilmikey> this one: http://jsfiddle.net/Sfgwk/1/
[07:21:12] <kollapse> lilmikey: Heh, I don't think jQuery has *-transform animation support. :)
[07:21:30] <seutje> lilmikey: sry, was out for a smoke
[07:21:33] <lilmikey> i dont think so either :(
[07:21:37] <lilmikey> np
[07:21:43] <kollapse> Make a plugin for it ?
[07:21:57] <lilmikey> there already is one
[07:22:07] <lilmikey> and id use it but i cant get the easing right:)
[07:22:30] <lilmikey> http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/
[07:22:32] <lilmikey> its here
[07:23:29] <lilmikey> it uses this easing: http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[07:23:36] <lilmikey> and that doesn't have linear.
[07:24:03] <kollapse> Wouldn't canvas to a better job than *-transform ?
[07:24:06] <mazzachre> What colorpicker plugin is jqueryUI theme roller using?
[07:24:17] <seutje> lilmikey: https://github.com/zachstronaut/jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale/ might be of interest
[07:24:24] <lilmikey> i did that
[07:24:27] <m_e> hm... so jquery has only like 8 widgets? no things like datatable, treeview etc.?
[07:24:33] <lilmikey> but it's not good for small angles
[07:24:39] <fzzbt> is it possible manipulate a file select widget's selected file to an arbitrary File object which i want to pass to it? I want to update the file selection if the user drags and drops a file to it, so that it doesn't just say "No file chosen".
[07:24:57] <fzzbt> but the dropped  file
[07:25:04] <kollapse> m_e: Actually jQuery UI has the widgets.
[07:25:08] <lilmikey> as it doesn't really animate
[07:25:58] <seutje> lilmikey: u have syntax errors btw
[07:26:11] <lilmikey> please point out :)
[07:26:14] <seutje> key/value in an object is separated by a colon, not a comma
[07:26:36] <lilmikey> yea that what i thought! you used coma :)
[07:26:52] <lilmikey> seutje> lilmikey: like any other animation? .animate('property', 'value') ?
[07:27:00] <lilmikey> I wasnt really sure.
[07:27:06] <seutje> that's not an object, that's just 2 strings
[07:27:32] <seutje> also, ur fiddle didn't include jQuery
[07:29:11] <Xotix> has anybody used this before? http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[07:29:19] <lilmikey> ok
[07:29:40] <lilmikey> i still dont know which objects separated by coma you mean
[07:31:02] <m_e> is there any good and easy datatable plugin?
[07:31:15] <Xotix> m_e datatables.net
[07:32:12] <m_e> thx
[07:33:03] <seutje> lilmikey: http://jsfiddle.net/Sfgwk/5/
[07:33:06] <seutje> almost... there...
[07:33:53] <lilmikey> nice!!
[07:36:36] <seutje> lilmikey: there we go, ur syntax for .animate() was slightly off http://jsfiddle.net/Sfgwk/6/
[07:37:06] <sente> Xotix: i've used that before
[07:37:33] <sente> i'm using it currently actually, with some difficulty though
[07:38:40] <lilmikey> awesome.
[07:38:44] <seutje> lilmikey: those top 2 bits are plugins btw
[07:38:52] <lilmikey> yes
[07:39:59] <Xotix> sense i wanted to recreated that http://www.zurb.com/playground/ajax_upload? but they use ajaxupload, seems to be an old version of it. Can you maybe help me getting it set up? Since there is no demo or explaintion on how the plugin works, what it does, what i have to care about in the php file etc. im quite lost.
[07:53:53] <datlap>  div 1 and div 2 that are next to each other. div 2 is a lot longer than div 1. when user scrolls downs, both divs roll down. how can i anchor div 1 when div2 scrolls down using jquery
[07:54:03] <majd> Hey #jquery - i have a div in my application that must toggle height on click between a fixed height (say 100px) and a height that automatically fits content that is called in an ajax request. How can i do that?
[07:55:05] <majd> i realize that this is a multi-layered question, i have  a solution, but it's not working as well as i want it to...

[07:59:46] <EdwardIII> it's saying it has no method close, which kinda makes sense because it hasn't been turned into a modal dialog box yet
[08:01:42] <EdwardIII> functional soup
[08:01:52] <EdwardIII> any pointers for this sort of thing in general?
[08:02:00] <lilmikey> seutje: i don't know if thats just me
[08:02:12] <lilmikey> but im seeing some strange behavior :) with that script
[08:02:37] <lilmikey> basically, sometimes it stops in the bottom (default) position for a few seconds
[08:03:12] <lilmikey> but i think that only happens on my site
[08:03:17] <lilmikey> might be other performance errors
[08:03:23] <lilmikey> anyway, the code is awesome
[08:05:52] <ryanneufeld> kollapse: interesting, that mootools and jquery are evenly matched, they probably both use the same underlying native methods
[08:06:37] <paul_uk> hey all, im trying to get all the li elements and not those a class.  I'm trying this: .parents('ul').find('li.show:not([@class]), li.hide:not([@class])')  can anyone point me to the right syntax?  thx
[08:07:06] <seutje> 'li.show:not(.class)'
[08:07:18] <seutje> class is a className, right?
[08:07:23] <kollapse> ryanneufeld: Dojo was slower for you too ?
[08:07:29] <ryanneufeld> kollapse: slowest
[08:07:30] <paul_uk> seutje, no class as in class="something"
[08:07:38] <seutje> yea, that's className
[08:07:52] <ryanneufeld> li.show:not(.something)
[08:08:07] <seutje> paul_uk: or do u want to exclude elements that have a class attribute?
[08:08:21] <ryanneufeld> will match <li class='show notSomething'> but not <li class="show something">
[08:08:23] <seutje> coz then it would never match anything afaict
[08:08:24] <paul_uk> seutje, i want to exclude elements that have a classname yes
[08:08:30] <paul_uk> ryanneufeld, you got it wrong :P
[08:08:36] <seutje> but "show" is a classname
[08:08:48] <seutje> so u want them to have a classname of "show" but no classname at all?
[08:08:53] <ryanneufeld> paul_uk: no, I'm sure i have it right
[08:08:57] * seutje 's head just exploded
[08:08:59] <paul_uk> seutje, I have 2 li tags that have no class and I want to exclude them
[08:09:03] <paul_uk> seutje, mine too!

[08:09:55] <kollapse> paul_uk: $("li").filter(":not([class])")
[08:10:00] <phlp> li.show will exclude them since they dont have the class show (or any class)
[08:10:27] <ryanneufeld> paul_uk: if they have class="show" or class="hide"  or no class at all
[08:10:44] <seutje> paul_uk: but when ur matching elements with class "show", wouldn't that automagically exclude those that don't have a/that class?
[08:10:46] <ryanneufeld> then you can just select $('li.show, li.hide')
[08:11:01] <ryanneufeld> seutje: yes, it would

[08:39:05] <CodeZombie> when hiding a div using slide (hide('slide', { direction : 'up' }), I'm noticing that the element below this element being hidden doesn't move up with the slide, it waits for the slide to finish. Is this intended functionality?
[08:39:40] <ryanneufeld> CodeZombie: intended perhaps not, but it depends on your markup
[08:45:03] <ryanneufeld> CodeZombie: could be your CSS/Markup is causing the phenomenon

[08:48:40] <CodeZombie> I actually just found the issue

[09:10:48] <skamikaze> fission6: working example from a booking software rendering x elements of 1 map at once
[09:11:07] <fission6> skamikaze: have you explored backbone.js, i am reading about it now
[09:12:06] <skamikaze> fission6: just read a bit bout that, not using it. I'm using jqueryui and my own class/mixins stuff
[09:12:26] <fission6> ok
[09:13:59] <faraway> skamikaze: hmm there was a "dead" iexplorer.exe in the process list, now after killing it, everything works again
[09:14:15] <skamikaze> faraway: .. :D
[09:14:26] <negev> ryanneufeld: that kind of sort of helped, but the row looks all messed up as its being dragged :/
[09:14:35] <skamikaze> faraway: sometime they'll release a real browser dude
[09:14:42] <ryanneufeld> negev: you'll need to do some css
[09:14:48] <negev> why?
[09:14:58] <negev> surely the table is already styled, why is the dragged stuff different?
[09:17:20] <faraway> skamikaze: currently i don't have the money for cryogenics ;) but it would be enough if ie6 would die :D
[09:20:53] <skamikaze> faraway: put ie7 on that wish list too
[09:24:20] <faraway> skamikaze: a big wish .. but i don't believe it will die soon. i don't want to know how many companies use xp with ie7 cause they cannot upgrade cause of some software.
[09:25:03] <skamikaze> faraway: that's no reason to use ie 7 in the real web
[09:29:17] <faraway> skamikaze: thats definitely true but tell this the so called "microsoft certified administrators" which, cause of upgrade process, don't install ofter browser then IE â¦ this is sometimes really frustrating.and even if they do, tell the employers to use two browsers ;)
[09:30:22] <datlap> i have a div class="sidebar" that  changes from relative to fixed whenever user scrolls down. it works but the div also jumps oustide of my container div. any idea?
[09:31:39] <faraway> datlap: i think you need to give the container around the fixed alement also a e.g. "position: relative" with a right and left value
[09:32:45] <faraway> datlap: i think fixed is like absolute relative to its offsetParent
[09:33:17] <faraway> datlap: but better ask in #css
[09:33:18] <datlap> faraway: i just need a top fix and keep everything else relative. can i do that?
[09:39:34] <keybo> how do i say if array is not empty in php
[09:40:57] <Evil_Donut> join #php
[09:41:13] <ekujawski> if (!empty($array))
[09:41:29] <k0rnel> !count($array)
[09:45:14] <sk8ball> is there intellisense files for vs 2010 for jquery 1.6.4?
[09:47:23] <phlp> sk8ball: http://appendto.com/community/jquery-vsdoc
[09:49:21] <sk8ball> phlp, awesome thx!
[09:50:58] <sk8ball> also, are there any breaking changes from 1.6.4 to 1.7?
[09:53:00] <phlp> sk8ball: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/03/jquery-1-7-released
[09:53:36] <sk8ball> phlp, one more thing... can i have multiple vsdoc/intellisense files installed at the same time for diff versions of jquery?
[09:53:43] <ryanneufeld> 1.7.1 is out
[09:53:59] <sk8ball> will it know which one to use automatically?
[09:54:32] <ryanneufeld> sk8ball: if you want more than one jquery version installed, you'll need to use no conflict. see ?.noConflict()
[09:54:32] <bot-t> sk8ball, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[09:55:29] <phlp> sk8ball: i believe it goes by whatever you have added to the page
[09:55:57] <fission6> anyone want to recommend me a template framework?
[09:56:03] <fission6> for handling json data
[09:56:21] <ryanneufeld> fission6: any template library can handle that
[09:56:35] <ryanneufeld> ?g jquery template plugin @ fission6
[09:56:36] <bot-t> fission6, Templates  jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
[09:57:55] <fission6> thats no longer being supported
[09:58:40] <Techdeck> hey guys. I'm trying to use amazon cloudfront, but I'm having some issues with $.post() requests. Anyone here works with cloudfront and knows how to get around it by any chance?
[09:58:44] <sk8ball> ryan, im talking about in different projects
[09:59:32] <sk8ball> can i have multiple versions of jquery intellisense files, and vs know which one to use based on the version of jquery being used in the projet?
[09:59:40] <sk8ball> project*
[10:00:31] <phlp> sk8ball: it appends -vsdoc.js to the end of your file you have added to the page and if that file exists with intellisense markup then it uses that
[10:03:03] <sk8ball> i see, so for jQ 1.7, i'd use jquery-1.7-vsdoc.js and then replace it with the minified version when ready for production
[10:03:20] <sk8ball> if im working on a project using jquery 1.6.4 id use that -vsdoc.js
[10:03:29] <phlp> yes
[10:03:34] <sk8ball> k
[10:03:35] <sk8ball> ty
[10:05:41] <Techdeck> anyone? :(
[10:07:14] <v29a> hey there. im currently trying to get the jqueryui demo to run locally on my machine - it works for queries on array, but as soon as i try to plugin json data it just does the json query and then displays the loading animation for half a second but displays nothing.
[10:07:14] <v29a> does anybody have any clues?
[10:07:41] <v29a> i used the demo code from http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/remote.html
[10:11:17] <thcipriani> v29a: code?
[10:15:06] <v29a> thcipriani: http://pastebin.com/J5Un0gt2
[10:15:35] <v29a> thcipriani: i basically took the sample code and put my url in
[10:16:30] <v29a> thcipriani: json looks like this: http://pastebin.com/AnNrwk1K
[10:16:55] <v29a> and autocomplete calls the url as i said ..
[10:20:42] <thcipriani> v29a: Looks like your source needs to be a string, array or callback
[10:20:49] <thcipriani> you
[10:21:04] <thcipriani> 'll have to do your AJAXin' seperate, my guess
[10:21:34] <v29a> huh?
[10:22:05] <v29a> isnt that a string that im handing for the source param?
[10:24:32] <v29a> thcipriani: it behaves the same way when i use the script from the example as source (ie http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/search.php)
[10:25:18] <aaronmcadam> that's not a string
[10:25:27] <aaronmcadam> ?eval [{"id": "gps", "value": "gps", "label": "gps"}]
[10:25:28] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: [{"id": "gps", "value": "gps", "label": "gps"}]
[10:25:37] <aaronmcadam> ?eval typeof [{"id": "gps", "value": "gps", "label": "gps"}]
[10:25:37] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "object"
[10:25:44] <aaronmcadam> well duh hehe :D
[10:26:14] <aaronmcadam> that's an array with one element
[10:26:18] <aaronmcadam> ?eval [{"id": "gps", "value": "gps", "label": "gps"}].length
[10:26:19] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: 1
[10:26:23] <aaronmcadam> see?
[10:26:31] <v29a> aaronmcadam: i think thcipriani was talking about the source parameter
[10:26:37] <v29a> which is source: "http://localhost:8000/ajax_select/ajax_lookup/globalsearch",
[10:26:42] <aaronmcadam> source?
[10:26:45] <aaronmcadam> you mean url?
[10:26:56] <aaronmcadam> ah right
[10:26:59] <v29a> the source parameter for jqueryui autocomplete
[10:27:02] <aaronmcadam> yeah needs to be quoted
[10:27:06] <aaronmcadam> obvs
[10:27:59] <v29a> but i still dont get what he meant ... because imo in the line i just pasted im handing a string
[10:29:05] <Dave_Stein> is there a way to use deferred for something like $.when( ( a == 2 ) ).then().... i know that syntax is not the answer, just looking for something that might do it
[10:29:41] <aaronmcadam> what?
[10:29:48] <phlp> v29a: what's the status code of the response?
[10:29:51] <aaronmcadam> if it took a long time for a to equal 2 maybe
[10:30:06] <v29a> phlp: on my localhost its 200
[10:30:11] <Dave_Stein> im using labJS and want to wait for that to complete and something else to complete
[10:30:15] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: if u had an asynchronous function that was assigning a, then u could use a Deferred yes
[10:30:15] <lilmikey> if (a = 2) { do this and that }
[10:30:20] <dabear> aaronmcadam: nope
[10:30:33] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: wait for what to complete?  2 ajax requests?  what's a?
[10:30:42] <Flawless> What's the right way to connect a link to some javascript? $("selector").click() ?
[10:30:44] <v29a> phlp: localhost:8000, where the webserver is running
[10:30:45] <aaronmcadam> most likely u don't want to do that with a script loader tho
[10:30:50] <Flawless> I mean, I'd like it to also work using keyboard navigation
[10:31:00] <Dave_Stein> im using LABjs to load JS and a custom one to load CSS onto the page. i awnt to wait for both to complete
[10:31:03] <Dave_Stein> *want
[10:31:12] <aaronmcadam> there's callbacks already with it
[10:31:12] <dabear> aaronmcadam: you can implement your own promises though. so if you have a job that is async and takes a lot of time, you could do $.when(myjob()).then...
[10:31:17] <danzik17> LABjs doesn't provide a completed callback or something?
[10:31:23] <Dave_Stein> yeah there's the wait function
[10:31:28] <aaronmcadam> that's what I meant dabear, I didn't ask the question
[10:31:32] <Dave_Stein> but i need to wait until "wait" fires along with another async call
[10:31:59] <dabear> dave_stein: you can implement your own promises though. so if you have a job that is async and takes a lot of time, you could do $.when(myjob()).then...
[10:32:23] <aaronmcadam> are u modules too tightly coupled?
[10:32:28] <aaronmcadam> s/u/ur
[10:32:38] <Dave_Stein> dabear: that's what I'm doing for my ajax calls, but unsure how to miimc when using labJS since it only has the wait function and it's not an ajax call, it slaps the scripts onto the page
[10:32:41] <phlp> v29a: have you tried doing the ajax request yourself like the jsonp example?
[10:32:46] <aaronmcadam> sounds like they're probably too interdependent
[10:33:10] <dabear> Dave_Stein: labjs?
[10:33:13] <Dave_Stein> well when a user switches a tab in my app, ineed to load the css for the page and the JS, without refreshing, so that's what im watiing for before initializing stuff
[10:33:20] <v29a> phlp: not yet ... ill look it up and report ..
[10:33:22] <Dave_Stein> dabear: yeah check it out, its a great lazy loader
[10:33:32] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: does labjs have a callback when stuff is done?
[10:33:44] <aaronmcadam> should do
[10:33:46] <Dave_Stein> yeah the wait function which i'd be able to use if i wasn't also waiting for another async call
[10:33:55] <dabear> Dave_Stein: you wanna implement a labjs loader -> jquery.promise ?
[10:34:21] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: simple.  just do something like var imwaiting = jQuery.Deferred();  in the wait callback, call imwaiting.resolve()
[10:34:38] <danzik17> Dave_Stein: then just do jQuery.when( imwaiting, myotherajax).done(function() {...})
[10:34:41] <Dave_Stein> danzik17: thanks I think that's what I was looking for
[10:34:43] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[10:35:16] <aaronmcadam> ?cc
[10:35:17] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[10:35:24] <Dave_Stein> i wasn't sure of just calling x = $.Deferred()
[10:35:26] <Dave_Stein> :)
[10:35:44] <jubby> Hey all! I have this code tossing a reference error: ReferenceError: Left side of assignment is not a reference.
[10:35:46] <jubby> https://gist.github.com/1386465
[10:35:49] <Dave_Stein> took me long enough to finally get to using deferred ha
[10:35:55] <Dave_Stein> jubby: you are messing up syntax in an object
[10:36:00] <Dave_Stein> most likely
[10:36:05] <Dave_Stein> oh i see :)
[10:36:13] <Dave_Stein> you can't make a value set something
[10:36:22] <Dave_Stein> your gist is like writing 'banana' = 'yellow';
[10:36:35] <aaronmcadam> wowzies
[10:36:42] <jubby> Dave_Stein: So how would I change those values?
[10:36:45] <Eviltwin> $('.product-side-nav li a').attr('rel',$('.product-side-nav li a').attr('href'))
[10:36:49] <aaronmcadam> s/=/:
[10:36:51] <Dave_Stein> thats how
[10:36:55] <Dave_Stein> from Eviltwin :)
[10:37:15] <aaronmcadam> yucky
[10:37:20] <aaronmcadam> use the dom dood
[10:37:23] <ajpiano> wat
[10:37:37] <dabear> w0t
[10:37:43] <aaronmcadam> [0].href and [0].rel dammit
[10:37:48] <ajpiano> $(".product-side-nav li a").attr("rel", function() { return this.href });
[10:37:49] <aaronmcadam> hehe :D
[10:37:58] <jubby> Dave_Stein: Eviltwin : Beautiful! Thanks guys!
[10:38:00] <Dave_Stein> i hate when i see .attr('id')
[10:38:02] <aaronmcadam> yes was just wondering about that
[10:38:02] <ajpiano> jubby: ^^
[10:38:12] <Eviltwin> Oh, more than one
[10:38:21] <Eviltwin> That could be a problem
[10:38:42] <Eviltwin> Use ajpiano's suggestion
[10:38:53] <aaronmcadam> sexuals
[10:39:01] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: are u coming to England for jquery conf?
[10:39:09] <ajpiano> i don't think so
[10:39:13] <aaronmcadam> aw man :(
[10:39:23] <jubby> Unfortunately the plugin Im using is written like that =P
[10:39:25] <aaronmcadam> too busy at the start of next year?
[10:40:00] <aaronmcadam> anyone coming to jquery conf?
[10:40:34] <tomasm-> hi, is there a plugin,etc that can replace a url's standard '#foo' anchor reference? so it can use that for elements given an id="foo" attribute, too....
[10:41:20] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: yeah, traveling then already
[10:42:20] <aaronmcadam> aw alrighty ajpiano :)
[10:42:40] <aaronmcadam> i met Rebecca 2 weeks ago, was great!
[10:43:01] <Dave_Stein> is there a way to remove doneCallbacks from a deferred?
[10:43:24] <aaronmcadam> like an unbind?
[10:43:26] <dabear> Dave_Stein: why do you wanna do that?
[10:43:38] <dabear> reject the deferred?
[10:43:44] <Dave_Stein> reject will still run callbacks
[10:44:08] <Dave_Stein> so if a user goes from tab a to tab b before the prior ajax calls are finished, i can say "dont try to load tab a anymore"
[10:45:04] <Dave_Stein> i had my own way of doin somethin like that but im tryin to see if i can just switch over to deferred all the way, hence the back to back questions
[10:45:28] <aaronmcadam> would be an interesting blog post Dave_Stein
[10:45:42] <Dave_Stein> if i end up sticking with that file i just might do that
[10:45:52] <Dave_Stein> i can probably fold deferred into it if anything
[10:45:55] <aaronmcadam> plz do :)
[10:46:05] <dabear> Dave_Stein: doneList is an internal variable, it is not exposed afaik
[10:46:22] <aaronmcadam> sounds hacky too
[10:46:24] <Dave_Stein> oh thanks i was gonna look into that
[10:46:34] <phlp> Dave_Stein: .abort() the ajax?
[10:47:07] <Dave_Stein> phlp: i'd need to cache the references to the ajax to abort it. i was thinking about that but i don't need to .abort it. if the user clicks A then B, it's no big deal if it continues to download A for if they go back
[10:47:45] <Dave_Stein> for my current object, i basically register an event like "dataloaded" and say i'm waiting for 3 things to be done. when each thing is done i call a function to increament the count. when it htis 3 it runs the callback
[10:47:58] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: are there any gotchas to do with mirroring bbone functionality with $.Callbacks that you've found?
[10:48:00] <Dave_Stein> but i can remove the callbacks
[10:48:05] <dabear> Dave_Stein: according to docs, if you .reject a deferred, the fail list of callbacks will be called
[10:48:20] <Dave_Stein> oh i see, the fail callbacks would do the .abort
[10:48:39] <Dave_Stein> that's not a bad option, i just don't know if i actually want to abort based on what i said
[10:48:42] <aaronmcadam> could point them to $.noop if u needed to
[10:49:00] <Dave_Stein> aaronmcadam: none that i've noticed so far. i have it in one production app and 2 in development
[10:49:06] <aaronmcadam> nice
[10:49:20] <aaronmcadam> it's cool taking concepts from bbone tho
[10:49:25] <Dave_Stein> i don't want fail to point to noop in case one day i need something for a fail, i think i'd be misuisng it
[10:49:31] <Dave_Stein> yeah i was talkin to ajpiano about it last week
[10:49:43] <Dave_Stein> i have my own backbone mvc withotu the backbone, just jquery + 2 functions from BB
[10:49:51] <aaronmcadam> are u using controllers?
[10:49:53] <Dave_Stein> ill be writing more about it, events was just my first post
[10:49:54] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[10:49:57] <aaronmcadam> cool
[10:50:20] <aaronmcadam> It'd be nice if there was a nice overview of why bbone doesn't have them and moves them into the view
[10:50:35] <Dave_Stein> i think that's fine on simpler apps
[10:50:42] <aaronmcadam> the best explanation i've seen is peepcode's topfunky making the correlation between desktop apps
[10:50:50] <Dave_Stein> my controller is ujst a singleton object anyway
[10:50:55] <aaronmcadam> ah right
[10:51:07] <aaronmcadam> you bind controllers to each sub view?
[10:51:47] <Dave_Stein> i have views that automatically hook up stuff when they are initialized. the controller figures out what needs new. most times im not using new, but adding to a collection that will do that for me
[10:52:13] <Dave_Stein> so my controller logic is super basic saying get me this data, make a collection, and pump it with objects using the data i AJAXed in
[10:52:39] <aaronmcadam> cool
[10:52:46] <Dave_Stein> and those objects are my views or models
[10:52:53] <aaronmcadam> and then model changes are just published to the views as normal?
[10:53:09] <Dave_Stein> yeah that's what im using my events for
[10:53:12] <aaronmcadam> nice
[10:53:42] <Dave_Stein> like Events.bind( 'item.updatedname', function( val ) { this.name.html( val ); });
[10:53:51] <Dave_Stein> so my models fire those things
[10:54:38] <Dave_Stein> i might put some more automated stuff in, in the future. i just like starting basic and putting on the pieces i need instead of having a beast at start with things i dont use
[10:54:56] <Dave_Stein> jquery is a minor exception although ai use a large large amount of the available functions :)
[10:55:15] <aaronmcadam> oh yeah
[10:55:22] <aaronmcadam> a nice modular system
[10:55:32] <mitchdaniel> cant figure out why i keep getting this error cont.delay is not a function any ideas ?
[10:56:20] <mrryanjohnston> Why would someone do something like $('.my-input').each(function() { $(this).click(function() { }); }); vs this $('.my-input').click(function() { });
[10:56:28] <mrryanjohnston> The second one seems like the better solution in my head
[10:56:40] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: check this out, Nic Zakas' slides http://t.co/ez0HFuNk
[10:56:56] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: using the Mediator pattern for modular js
[10:57:25] <Dave_Stein> cool thanks ill read in a bit
[10:57:34] <mitchdaniel> cont.delay(200).animate({'opacity':'0.0','top':'50px'},{duration:1,queue:false}); is th eine im referring to
[10:57:44] <aaronmcadam> yeah had the awesome pleasure of seeing his talk about it
[10:59:49] <Dave_Stein> im flipping through it now
[11:00:05] <Dave_Stein> yeah modules rock, that's why i like the events thing i made, nothing is coupledi n any way and run with or without the others
[11:00:20] <aaronmcadam> around slide 59
[11:00:40] <Dave_Stein> im on 38 :)
[11:01:04] <aaronmcadam> heh cool
[11:01:15] <subr00t> im using jQuery UI to render tabs in an index, one tab contain a products list, is there a way that when deleting a product will re-render the same index with the same tab?
[11:01:24] <Dave_Stein> so his sandbox looks like my controller theoretically
[11:01:30] <aaronmcadam> exactly right
[11:01:39] <aaronmcadam> that's how he introduced the talk
[11:01:55] <aaronmcadam> that this was the Controller part that Bbone doesn't include
[11:02:18] <Dave_Stein> its funny cause he says the module can access sandbox but shouldnt access non-native globals, but sandbox is a non-native global :)
[11:02:29] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[11:02:35] <Dave_Stein> i love how he calls it Core
[11:02:37] <aaronmcadam> I think it's the one exception maybe
[11:02:42] <Dave_Stein> that's what we call ours :)
[11:02:47] <Dave_Stein> yeah it is i was just being an ass about semantics
[11:02:48] <aaronmcadam> cool
[11:02:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah :)
[11:02:59] <Dave_Stein> my events is really living in $.Core.Events and our php lib is Core also
[11:03:23] <aaronmcadam> cool man
[11:03:32] <aaronmcadam> I still need to look at how to write APIs
[11:03:35] <aaronmcadam> code for resuse
[11:03:39] <aaronmcadam> reuse*
[11:03:41] <mitchdaniel> can anyone help me out with an error ?
[11:04:04] <aaronmcadam> I've got my own lib of stuff all nicely abstracted
[11:04:15] <z0ned> i have a function wrapped inside a $(document).ready() { ... } when i navigate to the page, everything works fine. however if i am already on the page, and refresh, it's as if the code is never being fired ??
[11:04:18] <aaronmcadam> but it's just how to even name things can be hard
[11:04:54] <Dave_Stein> yeah naming sucks, although reading this makes me feel good cause thats how ive been writing.
[11:05:01] <Dave_Stein> z0ned that is really weird, do you have a code snippet?
[11:05:23] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: I use ther $.extend pattern everywhere
[11:05:33] <aaronmcadam> probably too much haha
[11:05:56] <aaronmcadam> every method is customisable based on an opts obj literal
[11:06:16] <Dave_Stein> jquery $.extend?
[11:06:18] <aaronmcadam> with sensible* defaults
[11:06:23] <Dave_Stein> i used to do that
[11:06:26] <aaronmcadam> *I may have no sense
[11:06:28] <Dave_Stein> but i took the extend from BB
[11:06:32] <Dave_Stein> to make my objects
[11:06:36] <subr00t> im using jQuery UI to render tabs in an index, one tab contain a products list, is there a way that when deleting a product will re-render the same index with the same tab?
[11:06:39] <Dave_Stein> mixin is closest to actual objects like PHP
[11:06:41] <aaronmcadam> ah cool yeah makes sense
[11:06:42] <z0ned> Dave_Stein, if i am inside document.ready, would that mean that all the images have loaded already?
[11:06:49] <Dave_Stein> z0ned: nope
[11:06:51] <aaronmcadam> yeah mixins
[11:07:21] <z0ned> Dave_Stein, that's the problem then (i assume). where can i put my code so that i know the page has loaded?
[11:07:48] <skamikaze> z0ned: window.onload == all images are loaded
[11:08:27] <Dave_Stein> skamikaze: i never needed to wait for all images to load... is that the dif between document and window load?
[11:09:04] <skamikaze> Dave_Stein: depends on what browser you pick there ;)
[11:09:31] <Dave_Stein> yeah i thought so, gotta be careful of suggesting answers that are browser specific
[11:10:24] <z0ned> skamikaze, now it works in all but IE9 :(
[11:10:28] <skamikaze> Dave_Stein: ie dom ready detection is awkward but it's basically that
[11:10:47] <subr00t> im using jQuery UI to render tabs in an index, one tab contain a products list, is there a way that when deleting a product will re-render the same index with the same tab?
[11:10:53] <subr00t> please guys i need help
[11:11:14] <skamikaze> z0ned: used that? $(window).bind('load', function () {
[11:12:15] <z0ned> skamikaze, no difference. only IE has troubles though.
[11:12:32] <skamikaze> z0ned: got a gist for me?
[11:12:35] <z0ned> i was previously using $(window).load(function() {
[11:12:56] <skamikaze> z0ned: or jsfiddle/paste whatever
[11:12:58] <v29a> phlp: so i tried getting the json with $.getJSON("http://localhost:8000/ajax_select/ajax_lookup/globalsearch?term=a", function(data) { alert(data); }); but i do not get the alert ...
[11:13:11] <v29a> even though the webserver is queried
[11:13:36] <aaronmcadam> is it valid json
[11:13:44] <aaronmcadam> and see ?alert
[11:13:44] <bot-t> Forget alertâuse console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâs built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[11:13:48] <z0ned> skamikaze, it's a bit complicated since what i am doing is trying to use pixastic to change a bunch of images to grayscale once they're loaded. can't really upload the images to jsfiddle..
[11:13:55] <skamikaze> v29a: is it the same port for the page?
[11:14:05] <skamikaze> (same origin policy ftw)
[11:14:08] <v29a> skamikaze: no
[11:14:18] <skamikaze> ?jsonp @ v29a
[11:14:18] <bot-t> v29a, JSONP, Quickly Â« plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[11:14:33] <jedimind_> does :hidden not catch display: none ?
[11:14:50] <z0ned> subr00t, why don't you just use jquery to remove that item from the list when you delete ?
[11:14:52] <skamikaze> z0ned: a code example and a bit markup maybe?
[11:15:27] <v29a> skamikaze: ill read up on jsonp ... but i think its the different source if there is any security policy or something :/
[11:15:51] <subr00t> z0ned, i code with rails, and im a noob, have you some links to mention?
[11:15:57] <skamikaze> v29a: as i said - same origin policy strikes there
[11:16:11] <z0ned> subr00t, select the ID of the div, and call .remove()
[11:16:15] <skamikaze> ?faq @ subr00t
[11:16:19] <z0ned> $('#divID').remove()
[11:16:48] <subr00t> z0ned, will that remove the db record also?
[11:16:51] <skamikaze> subr00t: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[11:17:06] <z0ned> subr00t, no, javascript is client-side. why would that remove the db record?
[11:18:08] <subr00t> z0ned, in my case i need to call a destroy action to remove the record then i want to render the same tab automaticly
[11:18:26] <aaronmcadam> ?@hidden
[11:18:32] <aaronmcadam> ?:hidden
[11:18:38] <aaronmcadam> ha i killed it
[11:19:08] <z0ned> subr00t, use an ajax call to call some server-side script to remove the item from the DB, then use an onComplete callback to remove whatever element from the page
[11:19:13] <aaronmcadam> Dave_Stein: right I've added your blog to my rss, hope I don't miss your blog posts on this stuf
[11:19:19] <aaronmcadam> s/stuf/stuff
[11:19:20] <z0ned> ?ajax @ subr00t
[11:19:42] <Dave_Stein> i tweet when i write posts, i havent written often, but ill be writing more soon
[11:19:48] <Dave_Stein> esp since i haev at least one person interested ha
[11:20:14] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[11:20:20] <subr00t> thx z0ned, now i know where to look and how to think :)
[11:20:28] <aaronmcadam> I'm trying to get a dev specific feed, doesn't seem to be one?
[11:20:35] <KodeKamel> Hey guys.  I'm fairly new to jquery, and I have searched for a solution or best practice to redirect a page.  I'm honestly not as noob as that sounds, but I can't seem to solve this simple little issue. window.location.href = "http://www.google.com/";  Just simply stops working.  I've tested in multiple browsers, and It "HAS" worked.  My question:  "Is window.location.href = url;  the right way to redirect?"
[11:21:43] <z0ned> KodeKamel, unless someone else chimes in, that's the way i've always done. or do it in PHP using headers.
[11:21:48] <aaronmcadam> KodeKamel: have u tried just "window.location=.,,,"
[11:21:50] <skamikaze> KodeKamel: it's better to send a 301 header and redirect from server side
[11:22:00] <aaronmcadam> true
[11:22:16] <z0ned> what skamikaze said
[11:22:29] * skamikaze hides
[11:22:43] <ravenzz> or use iframes
[11:22:45] * ravenzz trolls
[11:22:51] <skamikaze> :P
[11:22:54] <aaronmcadam> use ajax!
[11:23:24] <z0ned> skamikaze, here's the problem from earlier: http://jsfiddle.net/tP4zH/
[11:23:31] <z0ned> not really much to see......without images
[11:23:35] <z0ned> or the pixastic library
[11:23:35] <aaronmcadam> why isn't there a way to prioritise tweets
[11:24:01] <aaronmcadam> like "hey, I care about what @Dave_Stein says, let me know!"
[11:24:19] <ravenzz> z0ned you can add resources (libraries) on jsfiddle
[11:24:24] <z0ned> aaronmcadam, can't you subscribe to someones tweet?
[11:24:40] <skamikaze> z0ned: use a simple class selector http://jsfiddle.net/tP4zH/1/
[11:24:54] <KodeKamel> skamikaze:  Thank you for that.  That's not done within jquery correct?  and haha at ravenzz:
[11:25:09] <z0ned> KodeKamel, that would be done with something server-side (like php)
[11:25:14] <skamikaze> KodeKamel: nope, it's your backend (php, ruby, ..)
[11:25:23] <ravenzz> KodeKamel or plain js
[11:25:34] <aaronmcadam> just had to make a custom list
[11:25:50] <z0ned> skamikaze, are you saying its the selector that IE could be having troubles with?
[11:26:08] <KodeKamel> understood.  Thank you to everyone for the assist.
[11:26:10] <z0ned> because the "complex" selector works fine everywhere else
[11:26:39] <skamikaze> z0ned: just a maybe as attributes and camelCase can be fuggi fuggi
[11:26:41] <KodeKamel> I hate to ask simple questions,  so thanks for being helpful.
[11:26:41] <skamikaze> :)
[11:27:46] <skamikaze> z0ned: it's maybe ie9 ignoring the camelcase - just guessing here
[11:30:53] <z0ned> skamikaze, doesn't seem to make a difference.
[11:31:24] <ravenzz> what about $(window).load(function() { $('.container img').foo() });
[11:31:55] <skamikaze> z0ned: what says console log in ie9?
[11:32:23] <z0ned> not sure i even have developer tools installed
[11:32:27] <z0ned> let me do that quick
[11:33:31] <z0ned> log shows nothing
[11:33:59] <z0ned> it's funny that sometimes it works. i think it has to do with whether the images have loaded or not
[11:34:09] <skamikaze> z0ned: and it works in any other browser? (log without calling that plugin please)
[11:35:21] <skamikaze> z0ned: you can use ajaxHooks from jaubourg if anything fails https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/
[11:35:50] <skamikaze> z0ned: or try it with an ugly setTimeout call
[11:36:00] <z0ned> if anything i'll just make two sets of images, one in grayscale and one in color. i really wanted to do it all in JS though :/
[11:36:22] <Dave_Stein> aaronmcadam: haha
[11:36:32] <Dave_Stein> i think that's what lists are for :)
[11:36:44] <Dave_Stein> and i see you added me to one
[11:36:45] <Dave_Stein> haha
[11:37:11] <z0ned> skamikaze, it was previously behaving the same in chrome, until i changed it to window.load as you suggested. that's why i think the problem is the images not being loaded yet.
[11:37:12] <skamikaze> z0ned: if you use that plugin you can fetch the images by ajax and bind them all at once using deferreds
[11:37:41] <z0ned> is window.load browser specific?
[11:38:00] <skamikaze> window.onload should fire after evrything is loaded so no
[11:38:05] <skamikaze> afaik
[11:38:09] <z0ned> strange then
[11:39:13] <z0ned> skamikaze, if i sit and hold f5, i can see the page refreshing over and over, and sometimes the images are gray, sometimes they're not. so that's definitely got to be what it is..
[11:41:58] <Emn1ty> I need some help with functionality for setting a time to see if a person has held onto the mouse for an extended period of time. RIght now I want the person to select images if they want to delete them, but if they decide to move them for it to not select them.
[11:42:30] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use javascriptmvc?
[11:42:48] <Emn1ty> time = timer*
[11:49:18] <skamikaze> bye all
[11:50:23] <Haraldson> Emn1ty: This is already handled by the click event, which is onrelease and not onpress
[11:50:41] <imsky> i long for combat
[11:50:41] <bot-t> (18 hours 20 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky ........
[11:50:47] <Haraldson> the user could choose to keep their mouse button pressed, move it away, and the click event wouldn't be triggered

[11:59:02] <winterpk> but I don't want them to overlap
[11:59:04] <pifantastic> I guess it chops off the bad '8' for not being octal?
[11:59:09] <Souvent22> hello.
[11:59:10] <pifantastic> and it becomes 01
[11:59:14] <Emn1ty> anyone have experience making a timer that returns true or false and a way to attach it to an mousedown call?
[11:59:26] <Souvent22> does anyone know if the $.cookie function uses only a "header" call, and not a full page request to retrieve the cookies?

[12:01:01] <merkoth> does anyone know why $.ajax would throw an error with no error code? I'm just getting a 0 and "error"
[12:01:09] <ryanneufeld> winterpk: you might just have to do some kind of collision detection

[12:02:48] <ryanneufeld> winterpk: nope

[12:13:36] <Mkop> office is so frikkin empty
[12:13:39] <Mkop> I am BORED
[12:14:10] <jutnux> Where you work Mkop?
[12:14:24] <Mkop> at a hospital in Bronx, NY
[12:14:44] <ragas> how do i result = <script>...</script>;
[12:15:08] <Mkop> ragas: script tags don't return a result.....
[12:15:29] <jutnux> Are you a nurse? Or a sysadmin? :L
[12:15:36] <Mkop> developer
[12:15:40] <ragas> they generate output; how do i catch that?
[12:16:08] <Mkop> I work on internal apps (90% web-based) for data analysis of lab results and the like
[12:16:24] <jutnux> Oh right.
[12:16:25] <Mkop> ragas: how do they generate output? document.write()? some function or another?
[12:16:26] <jutnux> Sounds fun.
[12:16:32] <Mkop> it is
[12:16:35] <Mkop> my job is awesome
[12:16:44] <jutnux> Got a poto of your setup?
[12:16:46] <jutnux> photo*
[12:16:56] <Mkop> no
[12:16:57] <Dave_Stein> if i do $.when( a() ).then( foo );
[12:17:05] <Dave_Stein> if a returned the AJAX request, what is foo getting as an argument
[12:17:11] <Mkop> nothing interesting to see though. a computer with three monitors
[12:17:20] <jutnux> Ah right.
[12:17:20] <Dave_Stein> i remembre reading this at some point somewhere heh
[12:17:30] <jutnux> Do they run Mac or Winslows?
[12:17:35] <Mkop> Dave_Stein: tias?
[12:17:57] <Dave_Stein> ?
[12:17:57] <Mkop> jutnux: we're almost entirely a windows shop
[12:18:01] <Mkop> try it and see
[12:18:09] <Dave_Stein> ah yeah was about to
[12:18:20] <Mkop> that's my way of saying "i got no clue" :-)
[12:18:22] <Dave_Stein> i just remember there's a specialcase where it turns into an array of arguments instead of one thing if i pass a b c instead of just a
[12:19:15] <Mkop> jutnux: some servers for out of the box systems run on unix OSes, but all of the servers run by my group are windows boxes
[12:19:21] <Dave_Stein> ah it will pass back 2 arguments, first being the JSON response ( well my php has a json header ) and the second is the XHR
[12:19:42] <jutnux> Oh right.
[12:19:44] <merkoth> does anyone know why $.ajax would throw an error without an error code?
[12:19:56] <Mkop> does jquery act differently based on the Content-type header? if it does, I should look into setting that response properly
[12:22:43] <Dave_Stein> Mkop it does autodetection for AJAX calls
[12:23:02] <Dave_Stein> all my AJAX calls pass back the right header so $.ajax doesn't need to get the type passed everytime in js
[12:23:04] <Mkop> meaning that `response` is an object instead of a string?
[12:23:10] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[12:23:22] <Mkop> oh, good to know
[12:23:28] <Dave_Stein> indeed
[12:29:56] <Emn1ty> Does anyone have a better solution to uncheck boxes if you move the item they are attached to? http://pastebin.com/8gbb1QPZ
[12:34:54] <Mkop> Emn1ty: instead of adding/removing class you can just do if ($(this).is(':checked'))
[12:35:17] <deed02392> How do I set the inner html of an element using jquery without having it escape the string?
[12:35:21] <Mkop> style comment: I recommend semicolons always
[12:36:06] <Mkop> deed02392: $("#element").html(str)
[12:36:28] <deed02392> nah that's what i'm using Mkop, it seems to escape characters in 'str'
[12:36:45] <Mkop> deed02392: maybe .text() is what you want?
[12:37:00] <Mkop> if neither of those do what you want, please post an example on jsfiddle.net
[12:37:14] <Emn1ty> i can worry about the overall syntax later, what I need to do is make it so that if I drag the image or if I hold it for a certain amount of time for it to remove the class/check from the form.
[12:37:32] <Emn1ty> as it is now, the time gives me the log but doesn't actually remove the styling
[12:37:56] <deed02392> basically it's a greasemonkey script which modifies a template element on a web page, but when I use html(str) I end up with instead of: "[% _.each(data.artists, function(artist)", something like "[%%20_.each%18data.artists, function..." etc
[12:38:07] <deed02392> which of course means the template data doesn't get parsed anymore
[12:38:43] <Mkop> deed02392: maybe it's a greasemonkey quirk?
[12:38:47] <Mkop> seems weird
[12:39:46] <Mkop> Emn1ty: have you considered using jquery-ui's draggable() interaction?
[12:39:54] <aaronmcadam> ah
[12:40:00] <Mkop> might be easier than dealing with raw DOM events yourself
[12:40:00] <aaronmcadam> needs to be escaped
[12:40:02] <deed02392> i suppose it could be Mkop
[12:40:04] <deed02392> but it doesn't seem likely
[12:40:17] <ajpiano> deed02392: are you trying to use string manipulation to modify a template inside of a script tag that in turn has embedded js in the template?
[12:40:20] <Emn1ty> i'm using a dragsort plugin
[12:40:28] <ajpiano> sounds... nausea-inducing
[12:40:31] <Emn1ty> but I'm triying to add selection functionality to it
[12:40:43] <deed02392> I am indeed ajpiano
[12:40:51] <Mkop> nausea++
[12:40:52] <Emn1ty> so you can select and delete certain images from the list of reorderable images
[12:41:03] <deed02392> I'm a nub, it's the only way I know how
[12:41:05] <aaronmcadam> what in the fook?
[12:41:43] <Mkop> as an aside, ajpiano I still owe you a pull request
[12:41:46] <Mkop> I haven't forgotten
[12:42:14] <aaronmcadam> whatcha workin on Mkop?
[12:42:17] <Mkop> Emn1ty: I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to do. having difficulty following
[12:42:26] <Mkop> aaronmcadam: stupid grunt reorganizing
[12:42:30] <ajpiano> Mkop: no porb
[12:42:33] <Mkop> why do you ask?
[12:42:33] <aaronmcadam> ah
[12:42:34] <Emn1ty> you can either move the images around and reorganize them
[12:42:41] <aaronmcadam> sorry was just curious :)
[12:42:50] <aaronmcadam> reorganizing or refactoring hehe
[12:42:54] <Emn1ty> OR you can select images and then delete them (in which case it highlights the one just clicked)
[12:42:54] <jedimind_> ajpiano, whats the best way to find a number of elements, but exclude ones that are currently hidden (though not hidden on the element itself, but their container)
[12:42:56] <Mkop> do you mean "what am I doing this hour" or "what do I do in general"?
[12:43:14] <jedimind_> :hidden also doesnt seem to capture display: none; from what i can see
[12:43:24] <ajpiano> .filter(":visible")
[12:43:26] <aaronmcadam> yeah I meant what ya up to
[12:44:03] <Emn1ty> the drag functionality is a plugin, and the click functionality is my own script which is working. What I need to do now is make it so that if you drag them, they lose their clicked status. I would use .click but it doesn't work so I'm stuck with .mousedown
[12:44:05] <jedimind_> will that propagade through parents too ?
[12:44:29] <jedimind_> <div style="display: block"><input /></div> $('input').filter(':visible'); will that return 0 ?
[12:44:33] <ajpiano> jedimind_: pretty sure it will work
[12:44:42] <ajpiano> huh
[12:44:45] <ajpiano> that input is visible.
[12:44:50] <jedimind_> err display: none
[12:44:50] <jedimind_> i meant
[12:44:56] <jedimind_> brain not functioning
[12:45:57] <QuietKode> In VS 2010 when I type $., $.ajax is not one of the autocomplete options (using jquery 1.7)
[12:46:01] <QuietKode> is that normal?
[12:46:01] <ajpiano> jedimind_: i believe it is
[12:46:43] <Mkop> are we arguing about whether jedimind's brain is functioning?
[12:47:09] <QuietKode> seems to be missing a host of jquery autocomplete options, anyone else run into this?
[12:47:19] <Emn1ty> Mkop: I've added the ability to select images on top of a drag and drop reordering plugin. What I need to do now is make it so that if you do drag and drop it it doesn't get mark as selected
[12:47:34] <Emn1ty> marked*
[12:47:41] <jedimind_> filtering for visible seems to have done the trick, thanks ajpiano
[12:48:03] <QuietKode> autocomplete = intellisense
[12:48:11] <Mkop> is $(this).closest('input[type="checkbox"]').checked=false; correct syntax?
[12:48:18] <ajpiano> nope
[12:48:29] <ajpiano> jquery objects don't have a checked property
[12:48:49] <Mkop> Emn1ty: ^^
[12:48:56] <ravenzz> :checked
[12:48:57] <ravenzz> ?
[12:48:59] <ajpiano> .prop("checked", false);
[12:49:09] <Emn1ty> its working though
[12:49:16] <Emn1ty> just not for the deselection
[12:49:17] <aaronmcadam> [0].checked ajpiano ?
[12:49:19] <ravenzz> oh he need to check it
[12:49:28] <ajpiano> would also work
[12:49:37] <aaronmcadam> cool
[12:49:52] <Norgus> can someone help me with a problem I'm having dynamically assigning functions to some elements?
[12:50:03] <Mkop> Emn1ty: I give up. you're using code that shouldn't work and you wonder why it sometimes doesn't work
[12:50:11] <Norgus> http://pastebin.com/1as2p23F
[12:50:12] <Emn1ty> lol
[12:50:24] <Norgus> please (teary eyes)
[12:50:30] <imsky> pls sir
[12:50:39] <Emn1ty> then what would be a better way to write that?
[12:51:05] <datlap>   i put my map in a div id="map" and load it via function load() {}. before i dont have ajax in my pagination so load() gets called whenever user clicks next. now i have ajax so load() doesnt get called. how do i call it
[12:51:22] <Mkop> Emn1ty: first fix the syntax to be correct. then post on jsfiddle so people can test it and see what is and isn't working
[12:51:55] <ajpiano> Norgus: what isn't working
[12:52:08] <ajpiano> there is so much bizarre about your approch here
[12:52:09] <fubeca> does anyone have experience using jquery within a webview in ios?
[12:52:22] <ajpiano> like chiefly the fact that you're re-querying the DOM to get the elements you just created
[12:52:56] <ajpiano> Norgus: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[12:53:17] <fubeca> bump: does anyone have experience using jquery within a webview in ios?
[12:53:18] <Norgus> I'm not using AJAX
[12:53:32] <ajpiano> Norgus: i know you aren't
[12:53:36] <ajpiano> the same situation applies though
[12:53:47] <Norgus> but I did just get a sugestion from someone to change how I bracket something
[12:54:19] <ajpiano> if you're adding elements on the fly you should be using event delegation, case closed
[12:54:42] <ryanneufeld> ?cc
[12:54:42] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[12:55:01] <Norgus> what should I read?
[12:55:03] <ryanneufeld> ?on @ Norgus
[12:55:03] <bot-t> Norgus, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:55:22] <ajpiano> the link i just sent you
[12:55:43] <Norgus> I'll check both links from just now i guess, thanks
[12:55:48] <ajpiano> Norgus: if you dismiss content based on the URL slug, you're gonna miss out on a lot of things
[12:56:10] <Norgus> ok
[12:56:51] <ryanneufeld> Norgus: ajpiano is on the jquery board, guy knows his isht, if he's giving you a url, you'd be better for reading it :)
[12:57:02] <ajpiano> ;)
[12:57:21] <ryanneufeld> ?hi5 @ ajpiano
[12:57:22] <bot-t> ajpiano, âµ
[12:58:06] <chrisvwebdev> this discussion intrigues me : )
[12:58:34] <Norgus> busy reading now, thank you ^^
[12:58:39] <gma> is it possible to persuade $.ajax that the data passed to the error callback (as xhr.responseText) is actually going to be JSON, so I don't need to eval it?
[12:58:39] <gma> or should I just wrap it in eval() ?
[12:59:07] <danzik17> gma: just use jQuery.parseJSON, don't use eval.
[12:59:15] <gma> danzik17: okay, thanks
[12:59:16] <chrisvwebdev> eval is evil
[13:04:47] <ryanneufeld> gma: or use dataType:'json
[13:04:51] <ryanneufeld> '
[13:04:57] <ryanneufeld> in your ajax options
[13:05:43] <Mkop> does that affect xhr.responseText? or just response? gma asked specifically about xhr.responseText though I guess there's no reason to just use response
[13:07:33] <Emn1ty> Mkop: I have it up now - http://jsfiddle.net/CrMGC/1/
[13:07:45] <Mkop> I need to focus on work. hopefully someone else will take a look
[13:08:03] <Emn1ty> ok
[13:08:52] <Emn1ty> If anyone wants to assist me in getting it so that if you hold the mouse for too long or move the mouse while selecting the item it will remove the class and selected status from the checkbox that would be great, code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/CrMGC/1/
[13:10:53] <aaronmcadam> would be helpful if u selected jquery from the list ;)
[13:11:57] <dlareg> hi
[13:12:07] <aaronmcadam> the code's incomplete Emn1ty
[13:12:29] <Emn1ty> it should be fine now
[13:12:38] <aaronmcadam> $("#listImages").dragsort is not a function
[13:12:51] <aaronmcadam> $("#listImages li img") is null
[13:13:11] <gma> ryanneufeld, Mkop: cheers, but parseJSON has done the job nicely
[13:13:14] <aaronmcadam> you've still not select jq from the Choose Framework widget
[13:13:23] <gma> I assumed that dataType only affected the data passed to the success call back
[13:13:39] <Emn1ty> just a sec, let me relink
[13:13:44] <Emn1ty> http://jsfiddle.net/CrMGC/11/
[13:16:52] <aaronmcadam> Emn1ty: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/CrMGC/12/
[13:17:24] <Emn1ty> :\ so it works for me but not for you...
[13:17:34] <lduros> is there a jQuery method that would allow me to make a string out of an entire html document, possibly including doctype?
[13:17:35] <Emn1ty> wtf
[13:17:46] <lduros> from DOM to a serialized string of the entire document?
[13:18:03] <aaronmcadam> get nothing in the Result pane
[13:18:15] <party2droid> lduros, like $("html").html();
[13:18:19] <party2droid> or
[13:18:23] <aaronmcadam> not sure the doctype is included in the dom
[13:18:26] <Emn1ty> where did those [0] come from?
[13:18:45] <party2droid> $.get("/url",{},function(data){alert(data);});
[13:18:47] <aaronmcadam> u need to unroll the jquery obj to a dom one
[13:18:52] <winterpk> Does anyone know a workaround for the verticle resizeable bug mentioned here: http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui/browse_thread/thread/a9af69765a98b630
[13:18:56] <aaronmcadam> [0] gives access to the DOM object
[13:19:17] <Emn1ty> but in my example, without those the code works...
[13:19:25] <sylow-> Hi, I have some divs that act as buttons. I'd like to get '123' from a div like <div data-test="123">foo</div> when clicking on it, but $(this).data('test') is undefined. I must be doing something wrong?
[13:19:27] <aaronmcadam> doesn't make sense
[13:19:32] <Emn1ty> i know
[13:19:48] <lduros> party2droid: so does that return the innerHTML value or something?
[13:20:07] <lduros> party2droid: is there a way to get the <!doctype> too, which is outside the html element?
[13:20:11] <party2droid> it returns the entire document
[13:20:14] <party2droid> $.get
[13:20:28] <lduros> $.get?
[13:20:29] <party2droid> there has to be a more sensible way
[13:20:33] <party2droid> wait wat wait
[13:20:39] <party2droid> $(document).html();
[13:20:40] <party2droid> try that
[13:20:48] <lduros> hmm let's see :-)
[13:21:29] <Emn1ty> aaronmcadam: doesn't the fact that I'm directly targeting the object type grant me access to it on a dom level?
[13:21:56] <lduros> party2droid: i'm getting null from it
[13:22:02] <party2droid> derp
[13:22:30] <party2droid> http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[13:22:36] <lduros> and $('html').html(); will get everything inside <html>, but not the <html> tag itself
[13:22:39] <lduros> which is an issue
[13:22:41] <party2droid> or
[13:22:49] <party2droid> try $('html').parent().html()
[13:22:57] <party2droid> although
[13:22:59] <party2droid> that might not work
[13:23:00] <lduros> let me see :-)
[13:23:17] <lduros> null
[13:25:57] <lduros> hmm
[13:26:10] <party2droid> why do you want the doctype?
[13:26:21] <lduros> coz it's for a firefox extension
[13:26:25] <lduros> i'm sandboxing some html content
[13:26:28] <party2droid> http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/showthread.php?t=45170
[13:26:30] <lduros> so then i need to take it out
[13:26:41] <lduros> so far all the stuf f i've tried doesn't work
[13:26:43] <party2droid> google is your friend
[13:26:50] <lduros> so i wondered maybe there was something in jquery that would be helpful
[13:27:02] <lduros> party2droid: thanks :-)
[13:27:03] <party2droid> theres a native method which will do just fine
[13:27:18] <winterpk> Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong with my resizable containment option (http://jsfiddle.net/winterpk/K8L4c/). I just want to contain the apptDiv's to the parent table.
[13:27:29] <lduros> the serializeToString()? that can't work for me, not in all cases
[13:27:52] <lduros> party2droid: oh you mean the document.doctype
[13:27:57] <lduros> yeh ok, thanks, that's good
[13:28:10] <lduros> but now even $('html').html() doesn't get the outer <html> element
[13:28:30] <lduros> sometimes too there's some commenting for IE etc
[13:28:37] <lduros> to show different elements
[13:28:44] <lduros> well, maybe I don't care about that though
[13:28:45] <lduros> :-)
[13:28:49] <lduros> since i use firefox
[13:38:50] <sylow-> ok.. *happy* , found a solution to my problem with attr(). $(this).attr('test'); gives what I want

[13:39:55] <TehRabbitt-Work> any ideas?
[13:41:35] <exaboy> is there a Modernizr equivalent that adds the browser to the <html>? i know jQuery.browser can detect but i don't want to manufacture something myself...
[13:42:21] <shesek> exaboy, you mean as a class?
[13:42:40] <DualDetroit_> Yo yo yo, mah name is Sam Nom and my dad is a touch tone phone. My crack home's a mess, I can't learn backbone.js -- so I wrote my own MVC framework with nested views, nested controllers, and nested models called detroit.js!
[13:43:23] <exaboy> yeah sure, just as Modernizer does it so you get something like <html class="ie ie6 etc..."
[13:43:28] * DualDetroit_ has ported Sizzle's selector engine to select nested models

[13:50:46] <ryanneufeld> Mkop: LOL
[13:51:42] <Geneller> hi Everyone, somebody, any clue to focus an input after an ajax request is complete ?
[13:51:42] <Mkop> why do I have to be so pedantic? if I was willing to do sloppy work, I would be home by now....
[13:52:32] <DualDetroit_> primeras: I don't need no English, I gots mah Detroiter twang.
[13:53:01] <primeras> DualDetroit, I don't understand

[13:54:28] <exaboy> ROFL!
[13:54:30] <Mkop> ooh, stories!
[13:54:44] <DualDetroit> jaequery: Yo yo listen up, mah name is Sam Nom and my dad is a touch tone phone. My crack home's a mess, I can't learn backbone.js -- so I wrote my own MVC framework with nested views, nested controllers, and nested models called detroit.js!
[13:54:46] <Mkop> yet another thing to break up the monotony of my day and delay my departure home
[13:55:09] <ryanneufeld> DualDetroit: your last comment made me concerned it was gonna get brokeback up in here
[13:55:21] <DualDetroit> ;)
[13:55:41] <jaequery> ok my turn, are there any difference in performance using the hashtags+routing to load up views and me just loading them via ajax?
[13:55:46] <DualDetroit> I'm only gay when it comes to putting Madonna in my pants.
[13:55:48] <ryanneufeld> no one needs nested views... PSH
[13:55:55] <jaequery> ok my turn, are there any difference in performance using the hashtags+routing to load up views versus* me just loading them via ajax?
[13:56:27] <DualDetroit> jaequery: Nested views are great.
[13:56:39] <ekkis> Geneller: what would be wrong with .focus()?
[13:56:49] <jaequery> i just want to know in terms of performance
[13:57:25] <Geneller> hi ekkis, i dont know
[13:57:56] <ekkis> Geneller: you don't know about that method? or you don't know what's wrong with using it?
[13:58:14] <ekkis> does anyone here know about $('script')?
[13:58:16] <Geneller> after the ajax request is complete i do something like $('#SearchApellido').focus();
[13:58:27] <Geneller> but i does not work
[13:58:58] <Geneller> even i've trying this
[13:59:02] <Geneller> $('#SearchApellidos').live('ready', function() {
[13:59:04] <Geneller> 					$(this).focus();
[13:59:05] <Geneller> 				});
[13:59:17] <ekkis> Geneller: when you say "after" - how exactly are you doing that?
[13:59:18] <Geneller> but it doesn't work either
[13:59:22] <ekkis> ah... I see
[13:59:45] <primeras> please help. how i do
[13:59:56] <ekkis> Geneller: show me how you make the ajax call
[14:01:00] <Geneller> ekkis: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1913151332
[14:01:14] <ekkis> primeras: I looked at your pastebin... so what's wrong with it?
[14:01:54] <Emn1ty> alright, so I'm back and asking if anyone has a better solution for what I have going on here: http://jsfiddle.net/CrMGC/11/
[14:02:03] <primeras> ekkis, that code auto refreshing page. okay but, refresh then html form not working
[14:02:39] <Geneller> ekkis: after i write the html in line 5 i try to focusin into the $('SearchApellido') input
[14:03:10] <ekkis> Geneller: 2 suggestions: use /success/ instead of /complete/ (and see if it helps - you might be erroring out) and do $('#SearchApellidos').focus()
[14:03:48] <Geneller> i already tried $('#SearchApellidos').focus() but it doesn't work
[14:03:54] <Geneller> let me try again
[14:04:07] <ekkis> primeras: so the timeout fires, fades, but fails to load? what does "html form not working" mean?
[14:04:20] <ekkis> Geneller: try it with success instead of complete
[14:05:04] <ekkis> Geneller: I doubt the .live() approach will work because the field will be ready before you issue the live event
[14:05:27] <datlap> i have this func $('#ajax_table_result').html(table); in ajax_get_update(). how do i pass this new table to function load() { var map ....} so the map can be reloaded w/ the new table?
[14:06:38] <ragas> ns$("#details").click(function (event) { $("#info_container").show(); });  seems to be well-formed, but its not working.
[14:06:45] <Geneller> ekkis: you are such a genius, thank you so much buddy
[14:07:00] <Geneller> it works with succes
[14:07:02] <Geneller> s
[14:08:23] <primeras> ekkis, example: http://adililhan.com/fs/examples/
[14:08:37] <primeras> please open page. and wait 3 second auto refresh
[14:08:47] <ekkis> Geneller: in general, you should have an error handler because otherwise you don't know when something failed
[14:09:09] <primeras> and one checked and send
[14:09:12] <primeras> not working
[14:09:34] <ekkis> primeras: it seems to reload fine
[14:09:37] <ekkis> what's not working?
[14:09:58] <primeras> one check box
[14:10:02] <primeras> and press send
[14:10:06] <ekkis> ok
[14:10:19] <ekkis> when I do it just reloads again
[14:11:31] <primeras> ekkis, what :S :/
[14:11:33] <Geneller> ekkis: $('#SearchAppellidos') has value, when its focused then cursor is at beginning of the value, is possible to put the cursor at the end of the value ?
[14:11:56] <ekkis> primeras: does the form submit properly if you disable the auto-refreshing?
[14:12:06] <Geneller> what i'm trying to do is a custom paginate
[14:12:22] <ekkis> Geneller: you might be able to do it with .select()
[14:12:29] <Geneller> so it would be much easier if the cursor would stay at the end
[14:12:46] <ekkis> if I recall it takes parameters for beginning and end of the selection which you can set to be the same and thus position the cursor
[14:13:12] <primeras> ekkis, no. all page must refreshing
[14:14:03] <ekkis> primeras: I would suggest you place the timeout inside of $(function() { ...here... })
[14:14:28] <ekkis> primeras: and test to make sure the form will submit properly without the refreshing
[14:18:30] <darkstar999> What does the greater-than symbol do here?   document.querySelectorAll(".css-chart > p em");
[14:18:43] <Emn1ty> asking if anyone has a better solution for what I have going on here (image resizing and a statement for if you move the image): http://jsfiddle.net/CrMGC/11/
[14:19:09] <zalun> could someone check if 1.7.1 is working fine on jsfiddle? I'm on a tablet - just added it
[14:19:21] <VeXii> darkstar999: like in CSS it selectes the first chiled p em tag of .css-chart
[14:19:21] <Haprog> darkstar999: it's a basic css selector. it means a direct child (not any grandchild)
[14:19:28] <primeras> ekkis, http://pastebin.com/8nPzUJ7s that?
[14:20:07] <Haprog> VeXii: no. :first-child is a different selector.
[14:20:14] <ekkis> primeras: your parens are messed up
[14:20:25] <darkstar999> thanks VeXii and Haprog
[14:20:52] <primeras> parens?
[14:21:36] <Jak2000> hi all
[14:21:43] <VeXii> hello
[14:22:24] <Jak2000> any basic tutorial for work with Jquery and Mysql?  i want insert and select some records (and yes google know but any advice ) ? thx
[14:24:01] <shesek> Jak2000, "jQuery and MySQL"? I guess you mean "jQuery and AJAX" + "<Some-server-side-language> and MySQL"
[14:25:41] <Jak2000> shesek yes! any advice of ebook or url?
[14:25:54] <Emn1ty> Does anyone has a better solution for what I have going on here (image resizing and a statement for if you move the image): http://jsfiddle.net/CrMGC/11/ ?
[14:27:18] <Eviltwin> Emn1ty: I can't really tell whta you're trying to do
[14:27:38] <Emn1ty> i have code that adds a class to the image and checks the checkbox in the same div
[14:28:15] <Emn1ty> what I am trying to do is, combined with a drag functionality, is make it so that if you try to drag it or move it around it removes the selected class and checkmark
[14:28:27] <Emn1ty> that way if you are just trying to move the image, it doesn't select it as well
[14:28:40] <Emn1ty> but for some reason I'm having trouble with that part
[14:40:15] <ccmonster> ok i have a json array, i want to filter and return only the elements that match values from another array
[14:42:37] <rroelofs> ccmonster: the first thing that comes to mind is using $.each to spin through the array and save the matches to another array.
[14:44:05] <rroelofs> ooh $.grep !
[14:45:01] <ccmonster> yea, grep was the first thing I thought of, but how do i match against the array?
[14:45:07] <ccmonster> will $.filter work ?
[14:45:29] <ravenzz> yep
[14:45:31] <Eviltwin> There is no #.filter
[14:45:36] <Eviltwin> $.filter*
[14:45:38] <ravenzz> filter()
[14:45:51] <ccmonster> indeed. just .filter()
[14:46:08] <ccmonster> anywho, not sure wha the best route is, filter(), $.grep, $.each
[14:46:18] <Eviltwin> What's the goal?
[14:46:22] <marshy> hey
[14:46:48] <marshy> I'm using $.ajax to handle the submitting of a form
[14:48:05] <Eviltwin> marshy: Congrats?
[14:48:16] <Geneller> hi, i'm trying to set the position of the cursor in a textarea, but i've been not able, any help ?
[14:48:22] <marshy> lol
[14:48:38] <marshy> Eviltwin: i accidentally sent it without completing
[14:48:39] <marshy> doing so now
[14:49:24] <marshy> I want the contents of a form to submit to submit to TWO actions. So I'm using $.ajax to handle the submitting for the first action. I have set "async: false " so that the first post completes before the 2nd one happens. I want the 2nd request to be a standard http post because i need it to forward them to another page.
[14:49:29] <Eviltwin> Geneller: Look at this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/401593/javascript-textarea-selection
[14:49:47] <marshy> But what's happening is that the form is redirecting to the 2nd page without completing the ajax request.
[14:49:50] <ccmonster> Eviltwin, iterate over an array, and return the items where item.name == [1,2,3] , but i dont think i can do an array like that as a match from
[14:49:55] <marshy> Even though I have async set to false.
[14:50:24] <Geneller> Eviltwin: yes, i look that, but i dont get it
[14:50:34] <Eviltwin> marshy: Don't use async: false, it's not a good solution
[14:51:02] <Eviltwin> marshy: Do something more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/h54dd/
[14:51:05] <ravenzz> perform the 2nd one on the 1st success
[14:51:15] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: Where the item.name is one of those?
[14:51:22] <ccmonster> yea
[14:51:37] <Eviltwin> Is items a jQuery collection?
[14:51:41] <ccmonster> return item.name = ['this','that','the other']
[14:51:48] <ccmonster> or something to that effect,
[14:51:54] <ccmonster> one of those
[14:51:54] <Eviltwin> What?
[14:52:09] <Eviltwin> you mean check if it's one of those three, right?
[14:52:17] <ccmonster> yea, if so, return
[14:52:37] <ravenzz> ?inarray @ ccmonster
[14:52:38] <bot-t> ccmonster, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[14:53:10] <marshy> Eviltwin: that's.... beautiful
[14:53:13] <ccmonster> hmm ravenzz ...
[14:53:40] <marshy> Eviltwin: I don't understand what that ajax function is doing though
[14:53:53] <ravenzz> indeed i didn't read the question. I read just the Eviltwin's last sentence so I could be wrong
[14:53:58] <Eviltwin> marshy: This is an example of validation
[14:54:17] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: So what's the larger problem?
[14:54:27] <marshy> Eviltwin:  do  i need that fake $.ajax function
[14:54:28] <Eviltwin> Trying to filter if the name is one of a set of things?
[14:54:40] <Eviltwin> marshy: Ignore that part
[14:54:44] <marshy> k thx
[14:55:15] <marshy> Eviltwin:  $("#form1").trigger("submit",true);  <---- this won't be recursive?
[14:55:26] <Eviltwin> marshy: Look at the first line inside the handler
[14:55:33] <ccmonster> i think $.grep + inArray() does the trick
[14:55:41] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: It should
[14:55:52] <Eviltwin> If you need to do it a lot, create an object instead
[14:55:58] <Eviltwin> And use key lookups to see if it exists
[14:56:25] <ccmonster> ah, and do $.each(obj, function(k,v){}) you mean?
[14:56:48] <ccmonster> or durn the items im matching FROM into an obj?
[14:57:20] <Eviltwin> var lookup={};$.each(["foo","bar","foobar"],function(k,v){lookup[v]=true;});
[14:57:35] <Eviltwin> Then if(lookup[this.name]) in your other loop
[14:57:40] <minna> Im trying to update an element using ajax, but all i get is a white page and an error in jquery. "attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope" 		state = "rejected"; " What does this mean?
[14:58:44] <Eviltwin> marshy: Are you using document.write?
[14:59:09] <Eviltwin> minna: Are you using document.write?
[14:59:41] <marshy> :)
[14:59:43] <minna> Eviltwin: using $.get, nothing special.
[14:59:49] <minna> Eviltwin: 1.7 jquery
[14:59:56] <Eviltwin> No where in your code do you use document.write?
[15:00:15] <minna> Eviltwin: document.write?
[15:00:38] <Eviltwin> minna: Do you know how to make a jsFiddle?
[15:00:49] <minna> Eviltwin: Not with ajax no.
[15:01:12] <Eviltwin> pastebin?
[15:01:22] <ravenzz> ccmonster http://jsfiddle.net/Qc9bR/
[15:01:45] <minna> Maybe it's because i'm trying to replace the same content from the response?
[15:01:58] <minna> Hm
[15:02:17] <ravenzz> hey minna
[15:02:19] <ravenzz> sup?
[15:02:31] <minna> ravenzz: swearing at this ajax call :-)
[15:03:10] <marshy> Eviltwin: that's a thing of beauty
[15:03:16] <ravenzz> nice :p
[15:03:20] <ravenzz> what ajax call?

[15:03:46] <minna> ravenzz: using jquery 1.7 i only get a blank white page on the whole page.
[15:03:49] <marshy> testing...
[15:05:13] <ravenzz> you don't need to supply an empty data object
[15:05:36] <ravenzz> also }); is a plus :p maybe a wrong paste
[15:05:52] <minna> ravenzz: you mean {} ?
[15:05:58] <ravenzz> yes
[15:06:23] <minna> ravenzz: Like this then http://jsfiddle.net/TtWU8/2/
[15:06:26] <ravenzz> where do you get that error?
[15:06:27] <minna> yeah it was a wrong paste :)
[15:06:44] <ravenzz> you miss a semicolon
[15:06:47] <Eviltwin> minna: Have you looked at $.load?
[15:06:50] <ravenzz> at the end of $test declaration

[15:07:43] <JohnnyL> How do you turn on and turn off hidden property in jQuery
[15:07:43] <JohnnyL> ?
[15:07:59] <Eviltwin> JohnnyL: ?
[15:08:55] <minna> ravenzz: How do i use $.ajax with this?
[15:11:20] <minna> ravenzz: I made some changes, going to test them.
[15:11:47] <ravenzz> I am back
[15:12:06] <ravenzz> well you should read the $.ajax doc
[15:12:11] <ravenzz> it is pretty short
[15:12:23] <minna> Will do :)
[15:12:41] <Eviltwin> I'd argue the $.ajax docs are longer than a lot of other ones
[15:12:59] <jedimind_> that doesnt say much :)
[15:13:51] <Yaazkal> Hello, How can I find the distance in pixels between html element and one of the window side... I don't need the distance taking as a reference another html element or body, because if you scroll then the distance between the element and the window (well, viewport) will change.
[15:14:19] <Eviltwin> ?.offset @ Yaazkal
[15:14:20] <bot-t> Yaazkal, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[15:14:56] <ravenzz> ahah shut up. otherwise she won't read that
[15:15:06] <Yaazkal> Eviltwin: but offset gives me the distance taking as a reference the document, right ?
[15:15:12] <Yaazkal> not the viewport
[15:15:42] <ajpiano> Yaazkal: you have to do $(elem).offset(top) - $(document).scrollTop() i believe
[15:15:59] <Eviltwin> SOmething like that
[15:16:03] <Yaazkal> ajpiano: I will try
[15:16:27] <Yaazkal> thanks Eviltwin and ajpiano, Will check and let you knoe
[15:16:30] <Yaazkal> know*
[15:18:48] <tfitts> is showing a div on .ajaxstart and hiding it on .ajaxstop the best way to have a loading indicator show up for ajax requests?
[15:20:33] <Yaazkal> ajpiano: It works !! Thanks a lot, I was missing the $(document).scroll... that you told me :)
[15:20:35] <Yaazkal> ajpiano++
[15:26:45] <duck_> wasn't sure where to report this, but the link to jQuery board Google group at the bottom of http://jquery.org/about/ links to the old, non-existent group. (link text reads "publicly available online")
[15:28:22] <ajpiano> duck_: thanks, i think i can take care of that
[15:28:39] <duck_> ajpiano: np
[15:28:45] <minna> ravenzz: Hm, i tried with .ajax and i get the data, but nothing get's replaced. http://jsfiddle.net/TtWU8/3/
[15:29:31] <ravenzz> minna what is on data ?

[15:34:08] <dov23> Hi, I am having a weird problem.  Can someone look at this please?
[15:34:09] <dov23> http://pastebin.com/VfByE29t
[15:36:00] <dov23> is this a normal way to set a value for an input element? $("#edit-field-vid-und-0-value").val(params.id);
[15:36:29] <minna> ravenzz: Now it's working better :-)
[15:36:37] <minna> ravenzz: Thanks! :-)
[15:36:48] <ravenzz> cool
[15:36:50] <ravenzz> yw
[15:40:28] <Ox41> Suggestion for best tooltip ?
[15:40:31] <cool> Please suggest a lightbox solution which can work with dynamically generated images. For example, I have a PHP script which generated 4-5graphs and echoes those png directly to browser. I tried jquery.lightbox-0.5 plugin but it didn't work because it expects png extension in markup but my image has .php script as src!
[15:41:13] <jedimind_> ZOMG!
[15:42:21] <opie_> dov23. what's up?
[15:42:37] <opie_> dov23: http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboudreau/tvCrY/
[15:44:17] <dov23> opie_: I don't see any difference
[15:44:42] <opie_> are you just asking about the use of val()?
[15:44:51] <cool> Anyone here knows on how to implement lightbox on dynamically generated images which are not saved on server but directly echoed into browser?
[15:47:49] <dov23> opie_: yesâ¦ it seems like it's not setting
[15:50:10] <heshanh> does .blur works in ie?
[15:51:33] <opie_> well you handler is kind of funky
[15:51:39] <opie_> not sure what that code is doing exactly
[15:51:58] <opie_> will onUploadComplete ever becalled before document.onready
[15:51:59] <dov23> opie_: funky in what sense?
[15:52:16] <dov23> opie_:  it's a callback that gets triggered externally
[15:52:19] <dov23> my alerts work fine
[15:52:24] <dov23> just doesn't set
[15:52:37] <opie_> hmmm
[16:01:30] <thomedy> okay i just got off the phone with  a web dev company... and i would love some feedback on my portfolio before i send it
[16:01:33] <thomedy> if you dont mind
[16:02:04] <hooloovoo> thomedy: just paste a link
[16:02:08] <thomedy> thank you
[16:02:16] <thomedy> www.lcchico.com
[16:02:34] <thomedy> www.thomedy.com/nondescript
[16:02:34] <marshy> Eviltwin: I tried that code
[16:02:42] <thomedy> www.thomedy.com/gormd
[16:02:52] <thomedy> the last 2 i built in alittle over a day...each.../
[16:03:00] <marshy> Eviltwin: The ajax request completes
[16:03:08] <thomedy> and the second one is tied to a nda so its nature is a bit vague
[16:03:14] <marshy> Eviltwin: but the original form does not submit
[16:03:51] <thomedy> i know how to take criticism so please be honest however i am human so please be polilte
[16:04:25] <hooloovoo> thomedy: i can't see much javascript anywhere there
[16:04:34] <hooloovoo> not that's not part of a drupal plugin at least
[16:05:00] <thomedy> really wait what one did you look at the first is a little js the other 2 more so
[16:05:27] <thomedy> the first one is the first i ever did the second two are far more involved
[16:05:53] <hooloovoo> thomedy: yes but have you written any of the javascripts?
[16:06:20] <thomedy> im sorry i dont' understand... are you asking if i wrote the js myself or where the js is
[16:06:56] <hooloovoo> thomedy: i'm asking if you wrote any javascript on any of those sites. if you did what file are they in?
[16:07:33] <thomedy> with nondescript its inline because it is the first draft concept for a client which got rejected for a more simple idea
[16:08:13] <thomedy> and the gormd is buried a bit into a file deep in the directory
[16:08:38] <thomedy> since gormd is intentionally simpler to show i could its just a simple slide show on hover
[16:09:01] <thomedy> i just want to make sure that the behavior and appearance is good/alluring/dynamic
[16:09:35] <thomedy> the js got droped for the most part in the lcchico for one reason or anothe rits just in my portfolio
[16:10:42] <thomedy> in nondescript almost all of the behavior is based in js

[16:20:26] <ldexterldesign> sup bros
[16:21:00] <ldexterldesign> how can i delay this function? full_screenshot_height(); - it can be on any event, don't care
[16:21:59] <ldexterldesign> full_screenshot_height().delay(1000); doesn't work?
[16:27:35] <whatthepoop> using jQuery Validate and writing the errors to my own container (#validation_error) via errorLabelContainer, how can I set the focus/scroll that container? it seems to be focusing on a somewhat-arbitrary place on the page (right around first field) even when I set "focusInvalid: false"
[16:33:26] <Eaven> so I have this function to add/remove dynamic fields for my form...
[16:33:52] <Eaven> anyway i added return false so that the click wouldnt make the page jump to the top through chrome/ff
[16:34:00] <Eaven> but on mobile safari it still jumps to the top
[16:34:57] <Eaven> http://pastie.org/2906363
[16:39:09] <GoSox> Can you add data to the live URL without reloading the page? The idea being that you would simulate a GET request while actually submitting the form ajax-ily using jquery?

[16:58:42] <Eviltwin> Yeah, you're right.
[16:58:42] <AndIrc_> is here someone who can speak German ?
[16:59:00] <Eviltwin> I can speak English. That's almost the same, right?
[16:59:09] <hooloovoo> Eviltwin: yes, almost.
[16:59:21] <imsky> sprechen zie doich
[16:59:23] <whatthepoop> I figured my issue out.. seems you can't scroll to a hidden element?, so I had to show() it first
[16:59:38] <hooloovoo> you can scroll to elements?
[16:59:47] <hooloovoo> had no clue =P
[17:00:34] <Eviltwin> whatthepoop: I believe a lot of the height/width/position/offset methods actually reveal the element to do their calculations
[17:00:40] <imsky> wrong
[17:00:45] <imsky> double wrong
[17:01:00] <Eaven> blahh
[17:01:03] <Eaven> http://pastie.org/2906363 my add_field and remove_field function cause jquery to scroll back to the top of the page rather acknowledging the return false and not scrolling to the top
[17:01:08] <Eaven> in mobile safari
[17:01:26] <whatthepoop> Eviltwin: hmmm, I've got no clue what was going on then... I assumed the same, though I'm pretty new to jquery/js so who knows.. it seems to work now when I show it first, though
[17:01:57] <tck> hi

[17:07:22] <tck> eviltwin
[17:07:23] <imsky> tck, just ran your message through like 5 languages in google translate: "I have to explain in English I have a question, it is difficult"
[17:07:34] <imsky> man, the days of babelfish crap are gone
[17:07:43] <imsky> damn translators are getting good

[17:10:33] <imsky> wat
[17:11:00] <scorphus> is it possible to query REST with jQuery?
[17:11:29] <Guest34758> Im curios to know how to deal with getting a php array into jquery.  I need a particular result issued depending on what that array comes back with. Im not sure where in that process (before using json or after its converted over to javascript) to have that done.  Looked up the php channel here but it seems to be invite only.
[17:11:57] <tck> wat?
[17:12:37] <tck> imsky : What do you mean ?
[17:13:10] <imsky> lol
[17:13:26] <imsky> tck you crazy german
[17:13:27] <GoSox> haha i needed php to talk to jquery, so i have this code that is funny because when you look at it through a browser, it looks like hard-coded "if ('no' === 'yes')"
[17:14:15] <tck> im not crazy ... :/
[17:15:27] <MJW1982> anyone know the best way?
[17:15:49] <imsky> i know many best ways
[17:16:02] <imsky> are you asking about the best of the best ways?
[17:17:37] <MJW1982> Well, imsky: since I am dealing with something starting in php and needing to get to jquery (through json), I just am not sure where in the process to put the conditionals to issue the qtips (qtip is a jquery library) for specific terms that may come up in the php array
[17:18:38] <GoSox> anyone know what this is all about?
[17:18:39] <GoSox> /<![CDATA[

[17:20:55] <GoSox> so its for really ancient browsers?
[17:22:35] <ekkis> yip
[17:22:47] <GoSox> oh google, you so craaaaazy
[17:23:00] <ekkis> there are lots of specialised browsers out there that don't recognise script tags
[17:23:13] <ekkis> anyone here know why this doesn't work? var x = $('<div class="y">xxx</div>'); x.find('.y')
[17:24:11] <ramkam2011> hi there, is there any jquery command that fixes inconsistencies in the <body /> ?
[17:24:16] <tck> i try to explain it: i wanna use jquery dialog . the content of this dialog is saved in a separate phpdata. this data needs a ID which it gets from the link . i just wanna click the link (a href), the page should post the id to the separate php data, the result of this php data should be send back and the dialog should Pop up
[17:24:32] <ekkis> ramkam2011: inconsistencies?
[17:24:53] <ramkam2011> ekkis: bad tags
[17:24:58] <Eaven> so what the fuck
[17:25:02] <ramkam2011> rogue tags ...
[17:25:09] <GoSox> what the fuck indeed
[17:25:16] <ramkam2011> lol
[17:25:26] <GoSox> ramkam2011: a jquery function to validate html? nope youll want an html validator for that
[17:26:06] <Eaven> why the fuck does mobile safari suck so much
[17:26:16] <GoSox> because you're doing it wrong
[17:26:26] <Eaven> i just want to hit my add field dynamically button and have it add the field without scrolling to the top of the page ;x
[17:26:28] <Eaven> http://pastie.org/2906363
[17:26:29] <Eaven> :(
[17:26:35] <zelrik> it s an apple product
[17:26:37] <Eaven> well help me understand the ways of the force yoda
[17:26:39] <Eaven> no shit
[17:26:43] <Eaven> but nevermind all that
[17:27:13] <tck> i try to explain it: i wanna use jquery dialog . the content of this dialog is saved in a separate phpdata. this data needs a ID which it gets from the link . i just wanna click the link (a href), the page should post the id to the separate php data, the result of this php data should be send back and the dialog should Pop up . how can i put the id variable into the a href link and how should i write the javascript?
[17:27:26] <ramkam2011> GoSox: The console says that it fixes tons of stuff when triggering and $('div').each(); maybe it's the browser that does the fixes
[17:28:31] <GoSox> wow the newest Opera browser hides the GET variables in the URL, that is so confusing when your developing
[17:28:39] <ekkis> ramkam2011: you mean unclosed tags?
[17:28:46] <ekkis> what are "rogue" tags?
[17:28:49] <ramkam2011> ekkis: yep
[17:28:55] <ekkis> tags the browser doesn't know it just ignores
[17:29:08] <ekkis> that's the job of the browser, not jquery
[17:29:09] <ramkam2011> ekkis: yep...
[17:29:14] <ramkam2011> :)
[17:29:28] <ramkam2011> that's what i thought
[17:29:32] <ramkam2011> thx
[17:32:00] <tck> i hope someone can understand my problem..
[17:34:48] <tck> i wanna use jquery dialog . the content of this dialog is saved in a separate phpdata. this data needs a ID which it gets from the link . i just wanna click the link (a href), the page should post the id to the separate php data, the result of this php data should be send back and the dialog should Pop up
[17:34:51] <qq99> I'd like to bind an event to mousemove, but I'd like it only to fire every n ms, what's the best approach?
[17:41:09] <ekkis> qq99: keep time in a global variable and do a diff every time your trigger fires
[17:41:25] <ekkis> if the diff is greater than your threshold, allow firing, otherwise get out
[17:41:43] <qq99> ekkis, thanks, that's what I'm onto now, just checking to see what's the best method, I assume javascripts Date object?
[17:42:16] <ekkis> yip
[17:43:22] <tck> ekkis please help me too
[17:43:44] <GoSox> ekkis: help me three!
[17:44:18] <ekkis> tck: sorry, I don't use dialogues
[17:44:27] <ekkis> don't know anything about them
[17:44:38] <ekkis> GoSox: what do you need?
[17:44:45] <GoSox> nothing just bustin gballs
[17:45:04] <ekkis> heh
[17:45:18] <ekkis> GoSox: do you know why my code doesn't work?
[17:45:38] <ekkis> var x = $('<div class="y">xxx</div>'); x.find('.y')
[17:45:43] <tck> ah. okay
[17:45:50] <GoSox> here's a question, can I have multiple ID's on a page, even if I'm going to treat them the same at all times?
[17:47:11] <GoSox> nevermind, even if you can, i'm sure you can't put a span inside the href attribute of an <a>, back to plan b
[17:47:34] <cgiGeek> any way to capture an input type image value amongst many ? <input type=image src=image.gif name=field1 value=somevalue>
[17:47:46] <timwis> Hey guys, is there a way to flash that error box in jQuery Mobile, perhaps even with your own custom error? (The one that says Error Loading Page)
[17:49:17] <minna> This is going to sound silly, but, i have namespaced a few functions and they run fine when the script load, but how do i run the function manually in the console?
[17:50:19] <coldhead> when you say namespace you mean you have wrapped them in a closure?
[17:50:29] <minna> I have namespaced them like this: var utils = window.utils || {};  utils.method = function(){ my function }; and run it like this utils.method();
[17:51:25] <Eaven> http://pastie.org/2906363 my add_field and remove_field function cause jquery to scroll back to the top of the page rather acknowledging the return false and not scrolling to the top. how can i keep it from scrolling up to the top of the page.
[17:51:36] <coldhead> so in the console window.utils.method() should work
[17:51:42] <coldhead> and you can even drop the window part
[17:52:55] <minna> coldhead: Hm, then i get not defined. I have wrapped them in this: jQuery(function ($) {  my namespaced functions   });
[17:53:01] <ekkis> cgiGeek: capture them?
[17:53:06] <minna> Maybe that's the problem?
[17:53:34] <ekkis> cgiGeek: first select the tags you want, then get their attributes
[17:53:52] <ekkis> cgiGeek: $('input [type="image"]').attr('value')
[17:53:56] <ekkis> something like that
[17:54:03] <cgiGeek> ekkis: awsome, thanks
[17:55:17] <ekkis> minna: looks fine to me; what's the issue?
[17:56:32] <minna> ekkis: I keep getting utils.method is not defined.
[17:56:42] <minna> It sure is defined, it's running when the script loads!
[17:56:58] <minna> Though i cannot start it manually in the console.
[17:57:35] <ekkis> minna: is utils defined?
[17:57:39] <ekkis> can you look at it?
[17:57:46] <coldhead> minna: if you attach them to window inside your $() they should remain accessible
[18:00:09] <minna> Damnit, i'll just make a fiddle, this is driving me insane.
[18:01:58] <minna> http://jsfiddle.net/ADSXw/
[18:02:14] <minna> Now im trying to run the function in the console, but it's not working.
[18:03:16] <initself> console.log('foo'); should print in Firebug in the console if inside $(document).ready(function(){ }); right?
[18:04:37] <initself> am i doing it wrong?
[18:04:38] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/mahNV/1/
[18:05:20] <minna> initself: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'tablesorter'
[18:05:25] <initself> where do you see that?
[18:05:48] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/mahNV/4/ works
[18:05:49] <minna> initself: Chrome console
[18:05:50] <coldhead> yow
[18:05:54] <initself> i am using FF
[18:05:59] <minna> yow?
[18:06:02] * initself tries.
[18:06:39] <minna> coldhead: Can you run the function manually in the console?
[18:06:41] <initself> where do you get Firebug for Chrome?
[18:06:52] * initself tries.
[18:06:52] <minna> initself: not needed, it's built in
[18:07:11] <initself> i dont know how to enter directly into the Firebug console
[18:07:19] <initself> oh i see the prompt
[18:07:31] <initself> Yes I can.
[18:07:47] <initself> Firebug doesn't seem to be showing any errors at all.
[18:09:46] <minna> ASDFGH!!!
[18:10:32] <minna> What the fuck is wrong with jsbin now...
[18:10:34] <initself> If I have a .toggle that I know works...
[18:10:41] <initself> wouldn't it show up in the Console?
[18:10:46] <initself> when i click it?
[18:11:17] <minna> No.
[18:11:33] <initself> not even
[18:11:34] <initself> $("button").click(function () {   console.log('booh');  $("#plines").toggle(); })
[18:12:16] <minna> That should write booh in the console yes
[18:12:27] <initself> Strangely, it doesn't.
[18:12:33] <initself> It's like my console is just unresponsive.
[18:12:35] <minna> But jsfiddle uses iframe for the preview, so no console data will show.
[18:12:40] <initself> right
[18:13:10] <Eaven> you all suck.
[18:13:10] <Eaven> js
[18:13:17] <Eaven> and not javascript nerds
[18:13:21] <Eaven> :D
[18:13:29] <initself> neith alert not console.log work
[18:13:36] <initself> wtf is wrong with my shit?
[18:13:48] <minna> initself: In you'r local environment?
[18:14:16] <initself> true
[18:14:37] <minna> Hm, i don't know. Can you upload the html?
[18:14:38] <DarkHouse> hey guys, I have a little problem, I'm trying to scroll a page using a draggable - http://jsfiddle.net/ny9LQ/ - but it just goes haywire and scrolls too fast, throwing the drag thing off the page, http://staging.citrusmedia.com/grandview/foundation/holiday
[18:14:55] <DarkHouse> console.log(y) gives me the proper values though
[18:15:42] * initself determines that he wasn't even running his script.
[18:16:10] <initself> can you have two scripts that both run $(document).ready(function() ?
[18:16:16] <DarkHouse> yes
[18:16:18] <minna> Yeah
[18:17:09] <minna> Seriously, i press render, and i see the javascript code... http://jsbin.com/ositil/3/edit#source
[18:17:13] <initself> wow, i was making a big assumption.  I'm all fixed.
[18:17:14] <minna> Is something wrong with jsbin?
[18:21:47] <DarkHouse> nevermind, turns out my issue is a bug with jqueryui http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5009
[18:23:05] <Prot> hmm where did include many go?
[18:23:05] <Prot> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/include
[18:23:59] <minna> is variable name "Test" the same as "test"?
[18:24:05] <Prot> no
[18:24:09] <minna> Ok
[18:25:04] <jen__> Is there open source code for file uploading files to my server from the browser?  I need someone to send me 1.5GB.
[18:25:20] <jen__> Perhaps something Jquery/php?
[18:30:50] <ekkis> how do I get a list of attributes in jquery?
[18:30:55] <ekkis> .attr() doesn't do it
[18:31:53] <Prot> ekkis: you can't
[18:31:58] <VeXii> jen__: if you need that much i think you better use a flash/java app or a ftp client
[18:31:59] <Prot> use regular javascript to get the attributes object
[18:32:14] <ekkis> Prot: really? that's so sad
[18:32:22] <Prot> sad cause you want it?
[18:32:35] <aca20031> sad becuase jquery seems to do everything else, seems an odd thing to not support
[18:32:35] <VeXii> ekkis: why do you need the list?
[18:32:47] <jen__> VeXii: user not savvy enought to use ftp client...they can only do drag/drop.
[18:32:53] <Prot> anyone know if $.getScript is now the prefered way of including scripts?
[18:33:02] <Prot> is there something wrong with modifying the header?
[18:33:29] <VeXii> jen__: http is realy suckt for 800+ mb files. try lokking in to flash/java app then
[18:33:44] <jen__> how about python/django?
[18:34:18] <VeXii> tbh think uploadify (jQ plugin) have a flash app for big file uploads have a look at that
[18:34:33] <Prot> use 'jquery file upload'
[18:34:40] <Prot> its nice, doesn't use flash
[18:35:05] <VeXii> how do it do it then?
[18:35:21] <Prot> you download it
[18:35:23] <Prot> and then you use it
[18:35:30] <Prot> its a plugin
[18:35:34] <VeXii> i never got good results on 800 mb + files but i do suck at server config
[18:35:46] <Prot> thats a server issue entirely
[18:35:54] <ekkis> VeXii: I need to copy all the attributes to another node
[18:36:07] <ekkis> aca20031: precisely
[18:41:38] <black_warlock> whats wrong here
[18:41:40] <black_warlock> onClick=" if(document.getElementbyid('fupload')==null {alert('pip')});"
[18:41:58] <coldhead> not enough jquery
[18:42:02] <VeXii> :D
[18:42:08] <coldhead> and you're using onclick like it's the 1980s
[18:42:10] <BinaryKitten> also, getElementById
[18:42:19] <black_warlock> ye corrected that alr
[18:42:44] <BinaryKitten> also if need ) before {
[18:43:21] <BinaryKitten> also drop the inline if you can
[18:43:26] <BinaryKitten> it's never nice
[18:43:55] <black_warlock> its just a simple check
[18:44:18] <black_warlock> uff doesnt work
[18:44:39] <black_warlock> if(document.getElementById('fupload')==null){alert('pip')};
[18:46:38] <VeXii> what error do you get?
[18:47:02] <cgiGeek> is that for nginx upload progress ?
[18:47:25] * BinaryKitten thinks .o0O( 2:46am is a good time to sleep )
[18:47:29] <VeXii> worked in chrome whith javascript: infront :p
[18:47:51] <DarkHouse> anybody know how i can make something draggable without using the jqueryui draggable plugin?
[18:48:45] <DarkHouse> i know that seems like a stupid thing to ask for, but there's a bug with the draggable plugin that means i can't use it
[18:48:46] <black_warlock> use silverlight :P
[18:49:21] <VeXii> html5 :D
[18:51:21] <black_warlock> god now the script alert the msg but still pass !
[18:51:33] <black_warlock> O.o
[18:51:56] <VeXii> "pass !" ?
[18:52:54] <shesek> DarkHouse, won't it make more sense to ask about the bug and how to fix it, rather than deciding not to use it at all?
[18:53:18] <DarkHouse> shesek: ok, how do i fix this bug http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5009
[18:55:54] <DarkHouse> here's what i'm trying to do. i have a little drag thing that needs to scroll the page - you can check it out here http://staging.citrusmedia.com/grandview/foundation/holiday - the value i'm passing to $(window).scrollTop(y); is what it should be, but for some reason it makes the draggable go haywire, causing it to like exponentially scroll and ends up flying off the page (just scroll your
[18:55:54] <DarkHouse> mousewheel to get it back)
[18:57:00] <DarkHouse> after playing with it for a while, and searching the web, i found that it's a bug due to the fact that it's in a fixed container, which can't change
[18:57:13] <DarkHouse> apparently that bug was posted 2 years ago and hasn't been resolved.
[18:57:45] <DarkHouse> so, i just want to build my own little custom draggable.
[18:58:42] <acidjazz> mmhmm tryin to get us to donate?
[18:59:02] <black_warlock> i wrote the function not inline
[18:59:11] <black_warlock> still doesnt work
[18:59:14] <minna> how do i log what a function does?
[18:59:15] <black_warlock> it continue !
[18:59:43] <black_warlock> for errors ?
[18:59:44] <Eaven> http://pastie.org/2906363 my add_field and remove_field function cause jquery to scroll back to the top of the page rather acknowledging the return false and not scrolling to the top. how can i keep it from scrolling up to the top of the page.
[18:59:53] <black_warlock> minna for errors ?
[19:00:01] <black_warlock> open the error console
[19:00:24] <minna> black_warlock: everything.
[19:00:28] <DarkHouse> acidjazz: sure, just send it to paypal@darkhousemedia.com :D
[19:00:30] <acidjazz> DarkHouse: u need to position static that scroller
[19:00:55] <DarkHouse> but, won't that make it move with the page then?
[19:01:08] <acidjazz> ah i mean fixed and u did
[19:01:14] <DarkHouse> yeah
[19:01:20] <black_warlock> console web under tools
[19:01:23] <acidjazz> the wheel works
[19:01:29] <DarkHouse> yeah
[19:01:30] <acidjazz> just not the drag
[19:01:35] <DarkHouse> exactly
[19:01:49] <acidjazz> console.log scrollTop DarkHouse
[19:02:16] <DarkHouse> but, if i comment out the $(window).scrollTop(y); and just do console.log(y); it gives me the expected values
[19:02:26] <DarkHouse> and the dragger works fine
[19:02:40] <DarkHouse> but as soon as i uncomment $(window).scrollTop(y); it goes nuts
[19:02:52] <acidjazz> do both
[19:03:26] <acidjazz> its repeating itself
[19:03:28] <acidjazz> calling itself
[19:03:32] <acidjazz> upon it executing
[19:03:38] <acidjazz> waterfalling until it hits hte bottom
[19:03:47] <acidjazz> maybe a return false or something
[19:03:50] <acidjazz> so it stops repeating
[19:03:52] <DarkHouse> maybe it is, i don't see how, it's just done in the 'drag' callback
[19:05:07] <DarkHouse> i did console.log(y) and console.log($(window).scrollTop()); and they both return the same values, even though the dragger is way off the screen now
[19:05:31] <DarkHouse> but, oddly enough, nothing outside of the min and max range i have
[19:06:39] <DarkHouse> I think the draggable plugin is trying to move the dragger when the window scrolls, even though it shouldn't
[19:09:03] <black_warlock> wtf why doesnt work this crap
[19:09:05] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/wY2A6/2/
[19:09:11] <DarkHouse> it's like it's trying to compensate for how much the window scrolled, which then moves the dragger, causing another drag callback to fire, and that's why it loops
[19:14:05] <Eaven> how do i make mobile safari not jump to the fucking top of the screen after clicking a jq button link ;x
[19:14:12] <Eaven> ive added return false everywhere
[19:14:32] <Eaven> it already had e.preventDefault
[19:14:39] <Eaven> replace_in_content
[19:15:08] <blueadept> would anyone know why how i'm looping this array incorrectly? http://pastie.org/private/crgtpxggt5ym8cdtqpqaq
[19:15:24] <blueadept> the jquery only runs for the last array item
[19:17:42] <blueadept> wait n/m, i know why
[19:18:38] <initself> can you create a url that's job is to store a parameter that the page itself will use?
[19:18:41] <initself> http
[19:18:44] <initself> like....
[19:19:06] <initself> <a href="mypagedon'tgoanywhere?param=foo">My Foo</a>
[19:19:08] <initself> or something like that?
[19:20:36] <initself> why isn't this legit?
[19:20:37] <initself> alert($(this).text);
[19:20:48] <acidjazz> text()
[19:21:21] <initself> acidjazz++
[19:21:33] <letterpress> if i've bound multiple keypress events to the document, how do i unbind one particular one? is there a better way to go about the cleanup than bind/unbind?
[19:21:44] <initself> so instead of looking for text(), I'd rather look for a "hidden parameter". What's the best way to do that?
[19:22:01] <initself> right now I'm using a <p>
[19:22:06] <initself> should i be using something else?
[19:22:10] <shesek> initself, linking to a URI that starts with `?` will send it to the same page
[19:22:25] <initself> shesek: i think that's what I am after.
[19:22:41] <acidjazz> letterpress: pass the function to unbind what you passed to bind
[19:23:23] <acidjazz> $(document).unbind('keypress', funciused);
[19:23:34] <initself> shesek: but, I dn't want it to actually send the query.
[19:23:43] <initself> I just want to be able to click it and run my javascript
[19:23:46] <letterpress> o yeah thanks acidjazz. the whole function, i see.
[19:23:51] <acidjazz> initself: in your <a> add somethign like <a data-param="bob">
[19:23:53] <initself> and have that item have a "paramter" in it.
[19:23:59] <acidjazz> initself: then $(this).data('bob') will give you that
[19:24:00] <initself> but this is valid html?
[19:24:01] <initself> data-param="bob">
[19:24:09] <acidjazz> data-* is valid html
[19:24:11] <acidjazz> which is why jquery has .data
[19:24:14] <initself> really!?
[19:24:16] <acidjazz> (newly learned it myself)
[19:24:17] <initself> wow, that' sprett ycool
[19:24:19] <acidjazz> yes itll pass w3
[19:24:24] <initself> whoa
[19:24:31] <initself> we're both late to the party, i guess!
[19:24:35] * initself tries.
[19:24:36] <acidjazz> letterpress: thats why u should name the func you pass to your binds so that u can reference that func name
[19:24:46] <shesek> acidjazz, no - `.data()` existsed before the `data-` attributed, it was recently used to support reading those attributed too
[19:24:50] <shesek> but it has other uses aswell
[19:25:08] <letterpress> yup thx
[19:25:41] <acidjazz> shesek/initself: http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[19:25:46] <initself> 19:23 < acidjazz> initself: then $(this).data('bob') will give you that
[19:25:51] <initself> but WHAT will it give you?
[19:26:03] <acidjazz> <a data-bob="thisvalue">
[19:26:14] <initself> but this is HTML 5
[19:26:19] <initself> right?
[19:27:00] <initself> it probably doesn't matter that it's HTML 5, I'm guessing, as long as my jQuery does the right thing?
[19:27:17] <acidjazz> otherwise add a custom attribute but its not as valid
[19:27:30] <acidjazz> like <a custom="thisvalue"> can be grabberd w/ $(this).attr('custom')
[19:27:34] <acidjazz> but i recommend data- over that
[19:27:48] <acidjazz> there are other ways, its all preference
[19:28:10] <initself> but i'm not gonna break IE6, right?
[19:30:29] <dov23> Hi, so I have a weird situation.  I have an input field of type text and when I do $('#id').attr('id' = 'Hello'); it changes in the rendered html, but when I do $('#id').val('Hello'); nothing happens
[19:32:47] <minna> How do i change a part of an attribute value?
[19:33:35] <perverse> dov - you have your syntax wrong i believe
[19:33:36] <initself> acidjazz: I can't manipulate that value like: $(this).data('opt_out_flag') = 0;
[19:33:39] <initself> ?
[19:33:44] <perverse> $('#id').attr('id', 'Hello');
[19:33:48] <perverse> should do what you wish
[19:34:02] <perverse> (note the comma, not an =)
[19:34:05] <devaholic> $('#id').attr('id' = 'Hello') is not javascript
[19:34:37] <perverse> it's not valid javascript, no
[19:34:46] <enerel> when i use a scroller with (jqueryUI other js) it does not work
[19:35:14] <acidjazz> cant he $(this).data('opt_out_flag', 0);
[19:35:16] <devaholic> this channel >_>
[19:35:21] <initself> acidjazz: that's what I'm trying
[19:35:39] <initself> doesn't seem to be working
[19:35:42] <initself> no errors, tho
[19:35:43] <acidjazz> or try $(this).attr('data-opt_out_flag', 0);
[19:36:31] <initself> acidjazz: that'll be too bad if that's the solution, methinks
[19:37:36] <initself> my does jsfiddle default to MooTools and not jQuery
[19:38:09] <acidjazz> i dont know but i blame jimmy wales' face
[19:39:16] <initself> hahah

[20:04:08] <ragas> 'foo' is the ID of an input field, which uses an image to submit.  so to swap the image for a better one, I'm using  $('#foo ').attr('src').replace("this.jpg","that.jpg"); Does that look about right?
[20:04:44] <initself> does this look right?
[20:04:45] <initself> $.getJSON('http://web-test.candelacorp.com/estatus/json/estatus_opt_out.pl', $(this).data(), function(data) {
[20:04:59] <initself> specifically the $(this).data() part?
[20:05:18] <Eviltwin> If that's the data you're trying to send...
[20:05:36] <initself> what does
[20:05:37] <initself> b.createDocumentFragment is not a function
[20:05:37] <initself> [Break On This Error] this[f]:this[f],f>0||e.cacheable||this...agments={};c.each({appendTo:"append",
[20:05:41] <initself> mean?
[20:06:10] <initself> i'm assuming it's because of the "data" i'm trying to pass?

[20:06:35] <Eviltwin> Do you know what a stack trace is?
[20:06:42] <initself> yes
[20:07:46] <initself> maybe i need to turn my object into JSON first?
[20:07:55] <initself> to get something more like: { name: "John", time: "2pm" }
[20:09:33] <misteranderson99> my.penis.Action(masturbation.Quickie);
[20:09:45] <initself> ya, cuz modifying to a normal thing doesn't blow up my code

[20:10:08] <black_warlock> im not good with js
[20:10:08] <kborchers> misteranderson99: please stop
[20:10:32] <initself> something like $("body").append(JSON.stringify(div.data("plant")));

[20:13:53] <Eviltwin> initself: http://jsfiddle.net/XjDfM/2/
[20:15:26] <initself> Eviltwin: I'm not seeeing that fiddle address my issue?
[20:15:35] <Eviltwin> It's your fiddle...
[20:15:43] <acidjazz> works fine hrre
[20:15:45] <initself> ya, but it doesn't have my updated code?
[20:15:59] <Eviltwin> "my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/XjDfM/"
[20:16:07] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/XjDfM/3/
[20:16:22] <initself> this part is jacked
[20:16:23] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/XjDfM/3/
[20:16:25] <initself> JSON.stringify($(this).data())
[20:16:49] <initself> data() has more than "just" the parameters I want.
[20:16:55] <initself> is there a way to prevent that?
[20:17:08] <Eviltwin> You just send the parameters you want...
[20:17:25] <initself> i thought it would be cool to just pass the whole damn thing somehow.
[20:17:44] <initself> i mean, the url ends up looking like this:
[20:18:08] <initself> http://pastebin.com/PMWw0fbt
[20:18:41] <initself> i bet there's no quick and dirty way here
[20:19:36] <Eviltwin> Well what do you want it to look like?
[20:20:07] <initself> http://web-test.candelacorp.com/estatus/json/estatus_opt_out.pl?email_addr=joseph.marchena%40graybar.com&opt_out_flag=1
[20:21:40] <Eviltwin> Try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/XjDfM/4/
[20:21:45] <ragas> my neck is so frikkin sore from aligning pixels for the last several days.
[20:22:03] <initself> Eviltwin: that's what I did do to genearte that URL.
[20:22:15] <initself> but that forces me to have to specify my fields
[20:22:35] <initself> i was exploring not having to do that, to just simply pass .data and turn it into JSON.
[20:22:47] <initself> It doesn't seem like that's possible given the kind of object that .data() is
[20:23:48] <Eviltwin> You're not the only one who uses .data()
[20:24:01] <Eviltwin> Event listeners are tracked that way too
[20:24:49] <acidjazz> lol .dara does a craplosd read the docs
[20:24:59] <acidjazz> sry on pho.e
[20:25:09] <acidjazz> beertime
[20:25:21] <initself> do the docs say, if you just want your parameters and nothing else, do this?
[20:25:30] <initself> i'm not seeing that
[20:25:52] <acidjazz>  kmpile a paeams areay or obj or make a func that doez it
[20:27:00] <Eviltwin> initself: You can do .data("mystuff",{})
[20:27:09] <Eviltwin> And then only access keys in "mystuff"
[20:27:50] <initself> Eviltwin: but my .data is being bulit using the data-param thing in my html
[20:27:56] <Eviltwin> Right
[20:28:02] <Eviltwin> You won't be able to do that the same way
[20:28:07] <Eviltwin> So the choice is yours
[20:28:08] <initself> That's what I'm saying.
[20:28:10] <Eviltwin> Extract the keys you want
[20:28:13] <Eviltwin> Directly
[20:28:16] <initself> Eviltwin: Right, that's what I did.
[20:28:18] <initself> I'm good now.
[20:28:34] <initself> I just wish data-param would just give me a simple data store with only what I put in it.
[20:28:43] <initself> But it probably needs the extra sugar for some reason.
[20:30:18] <Eviltwin> It's not reasonable to say "I wish global scope was only for me"
[20:30:24] <initself> hehehe
[20:30:31] <initself> I can see that. ;)
[20:33:48] <initself> if a url returns valid json, should you get a 500 error?
[20:34:05] <Eviltwin> A 500 error is a server wrror
[20:34:24] <initself> i bet it's permissions
[20:34:27] <initself> Eviltwin++
[20:36:56] <initself> if Firebug reports 200 OK but then it shows read and doesn't print any Response, what does that mean?
[20:37:12] <initself> Because the URL, when I run it directly, returns valid JSON.
[20:40:04] <initself> my success function doesn't execute, so the url shows success, but jQuery doesn't like what's being returned.
[20:41:57] <Eviltwin> If it's not valid JSON and you're trying to parse it as JSON, it won't be happy.
[20:42:19] <initself> i might be doing a cross domain request
[20:43:06] <Eviltwin> Well you can't do cross-xomain AJAX
[20:43:21] <initself> right, i'm on the same domain with a different host name
[20:43:32] <CodeZombie> does anyone know if there's a version of jquery.mousewheel that works with 1.7?
[20:43:32] <initself> i'm gonna just make a symlink, should fix it
[20:43:42] <CodeZombie> mousewheel 1.3 is broken
[20:44:39] <initself> there we go
[20:49:35] <initself> Eviltwin++

[20:49:40] <initself> thanks for your help

[20:50:11] <edgy> Hi, sometimes I see things like $("li") or $("ul li") or $("ul > li") is there any difference? because after all li would come after a ul!
[20:53:11] <Eviltwin> edgy: There are ol's
[20:53:29] <edgy> Eviltwin: ah!
[20:53:50] <edgy> Eviltwin: and regarding the ">" why is it used sometimes?
[20:54:07] <Eviltwin> "ul li" means an li anywhere inside a ul
[20:54:15] <Eviltwin> "ul > li" means an li immediately inside a ul
[20:54:19] <Eviltwin> A child instead of a descendant
[20:56:39] <lukekarrys> #jquerymobile-dev
[20:57:18] <edgy> Eviltwin: awsome! thanks
[22:15:49] <ekkis> anyone around interested in a tough challenge?
[22:16:47] <AllStruck> meh
[22:17:32] <AllStruck> are you interested in asking a question or something?
[22:18:22] <ekkis> AllStruck: here's my problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8234215/where-are-scripts-loaded-after-an-ajax-call
[22:22:13] <AllStruck> boil it down man
[22:22:26] <AllStruck> what time is it there?
[22:23:40] <ekkis> AllStruck: the thread has gotten long but basically, I need to load a div with some html
[22:23:50] <ekkis> the html will include scripts
[22:23:53] <AllStruck> using ajax
[22:24:00] <ekkis> those scripts want to see themselves but they can't
[22:24:10] <AllStruck> scripts don't want things
[22:24:21] <AllStruck> :P
[22:24:21] <ekkis> yes, as you can see, main.html uses ajax to do the load
[22:24:38] <AllStruck> are you like loading in scripts with ajax?
[22:24:39] <ekkis> the script can't see itself when it's loaded dynamically
[22:24:59] <AllStruck> you mean the script doesn't process when it's loaded by ajax?
[22:24:59] <ekkis> yes, see main.html in the posting
[22:25:09] <ekkis> no, it does process
[22:25:22] <AllStruck> what do you mean it doesn't see itself?
[22:25:30] <ekkis> but the reference in the script (see plugin.js) to $('script') doesn't contain itself
[22:27:44] <enerel> http://www.mongolianairlines.com/test/ c_old.last is not a function, is it jQuery conflict?

[22:44:55] <muhoo> from firebug, how can i get access to a function defined like jQuery(function($) { function foobar(){ ..}); ?
[22:45:08] <muhoo> i tried foobar() and $.foobar() with no luck
[22:46:11] <Eviltwin> muhoo: You can't
[22:46:19] <Eviltwin> It's not possible
[22:47:57] <ekkis> muhoo: you can't
[22:47:59] <muhoo> what?
[22:48:07] <ekkis> you declared the function inside a closure
[22:48:11] <muhoo> um, well maybe i'm asking the wrong question
[22:48:18] <ekkis> with the closure ends, it cleans up
[22:48:36] <Eviltwin> ekkis: Um... not exactly
[22:48:58] * ekkis used the wrong nomenclature again
[22:49:14] <ekkis> I don't know what the hell I'm talking about, never mind me
[22:49:16] <muhoo> how can i define a function from somewhere in the middle of a page, so that it is accessible from anywhere?
[22:49:28] <Eviltwin> window.foobar = foobar
[22:49:34] <ekkis> muhoo: function myfunc() {}
[22:50:34] <muhoo> so what would be the purpose of jQuery(function($) { function foo(){}) then?
[22:50:52] <Eviltwin> muhoo: What are you trying to do?
[22:50:56] <muhoo> i guess i'm asking: what exactly is that jQuery(function($) doing?
[22:51:19] <sasori> hi, do you guys know any alternative for jquery's calendar ?
[22:51:23] <muhoo> eviltwin: i'm trying to understand some code i inherited
[22:51:24] <Eviltwin> It allows you the privacy of that scope
[22:51:45] <sasori> i meant, an alternative for this ? http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[22:52:05] <muhoo> is jQuery(function($) a long form of say $(), or $(document) or something?
[22:52:22] <muhoo> or $(document).ready?
[22:52:27] <Eviltwin> $(function(){}) means $(document).ready(function(){})
[22:52:43] <Eviltwin> And $(document).ready passes jQuery as the first arbument of that function
[22:52:51] <muhoo> awesome, thanks. so jQuery(function($) means?
[22:53:15] <Eviltwin> Means OnDomReady, run that code
[22:53:21] <Eviltwin> And allow it to use $ instead of jQuery instead
[22:53:26] <Eviltwin> Even if there's a noConflict
[22:53:57] <muhoo> so jQuery(function($) { }) is the same as $(documen).ready(function(){}) then?
[22:54:32] <Eviltwin> If there's no jQuery.noConflict()
[22:54:41] <muhoo> hm, ok
[22:54:56] <muhoo> if there is?
[22:55:09] <EchoBravo> dimensional rift.
[22:55:13] <muhoo> heh
[22:55:20] <Eviltwin> Then jQuery(document).ready(function($){})
[22:55:24] <muhoo> thermal discouragement jquery
[22:55:26] <enerel> http://www.mongolianairlines.com/test/ c_old.last is not a function, is it jQuery conflict?
[22:55:31] <Eviltwin> If you're writing a plugin
[22:55:39] <muhoo> i'm not
[22:55:48] <Eviltwin> Generally that's done as (function($){...})(jQuery);
[22:57:57] <muhoo> hmm, so if there's an arg passed, then $(function(){}) is really $(function(jQuery){}), right?
[22:58:12] <muhoo> because the function doesn't have 0 args, it has 1, right?
[22:58:32] <Eviltwin> enerel: This is jQuery 1.3.2
[22:58:34] <Eviltwin> That's why
[22:58:46] <Eviltwin> muhoo: Not really
[22:59:00] <Eviltwin> Functions can accept any number of args and be fed any number of args
[22:59:53] <muhoo> so if i have foo(){}, i can call foo(bar, baz, quux) ?
[22:59:58] <Eviltwin> Sure
[23:00:10] <Eviltwin> ANd if you have foo(bar, baz, quuz){}
[23:00:11] <muhoo> and the arg show up as an array i guess
[23:00:12] <Eviltwin> You can call foo()
[23:00:23] <Eviltwin> bar, baz, and quuz will all be undefined
[23:00:45] <Eviltwin> In any function, there's an array-like thing called arguments
[23:00:59] <muhoo> ok, i get it. like perl or bash
[23:01:06] <muhoo> shift
[23:01:07] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[23:01:09] <Eviltwin> Well
[23:01:20] <Eviltwin> More like my($bar,$baz,$quuz)=@_;
[23:01:35] <muhoo> aha
[23:01:45] <Eviltwin> The original arguments array remains unchanged
[23:02:00] <muhoo> and $ is an alias for jQuery, correct?
[23:02:32] <Eviltwin> By default, yes
[23:02:43] <Eviltwin> If you call jQuery.noConflict(), it undoes that alias
[23:02:49] <muhoo> i'm starting to see the horizon now
[23:03:14] <muhoo> aha! so that's whhat noconflict is, ok
[23:03:49] <Eviltwin> Some things like WordPress do noConflict automatically
[23:06:04] <muhoo> so. is window.foo() the way to make a function available to firebug? if foo has to be declared inside a documentready?
[23:06:33] <muhoo> i'm just trying to get a handle on this stuff from a repl, firebug by default.
[23:07:13] <shesek> muhoo, unless you're in a break point inside a scope - yes, the function has to be stored as a property of the global object (window in browser environment) to be accessible from Firebug
[23:07:13] <enerel> Eviltwin: sorry what do you mean?
[23:07:26] <muhoo> cool, thanks
[23:07:32] <shesek> (or as a property of a property, etc)
[23:07:32] <Eviltwin> Any functions or variables defined in another function are only accessible to that scope
[23:07:47] <muhoo> right, it's lexical scope IIRC
[23:07:58] <muhoo> and there are closures out the wazoo in js and jquery it seems
[23:08:02] <Eviltwin> enerel: What version of jQuery is this: http://www.mongolianairlines.com/test/js/jquery-1.6.4.min.js
[23:08:08] <shesek> muhoo, not much different than how you would access that function anywhere else, really - nothing special about firebug
[23:08:21] <enerel> Eviltwin: oh
[23:08:31] <enerel> the name is different
[23:08:45] <Eviltwin> It is
[23:08:47] <Eviltwin> Fix that
[23:08:52] <enerel> thanks
[23:09:16] <Eviltwin> I don't know why but I've seen 1.3.2 mislabeled a bunch
[23:10:00] <enerel> Eviltwin: thanks a lot
[23:10:07] <enerel> it was pain in the ass
[23:11:19] <scar2> is there a jquery/javascript way to change scrollbars, or just css?
[23:11:46] <Eviltwin> Meaning what/how?

[23:23:42] <StPiere> hello, i have an input field i a want to recognize tab character, like '\t'  .. var delimiter = $('#field').val();   if (delimiter == '\t\) {...} ... but the if condition is false ... can someone help?
[23:24:03] <StPiere> sorry, if (delimiter == '\t')
[23:25:58] <StPiere> the field is an input field <input type="text" id="#field" name="field"/>
[23:26:20] <StPiere> typo, <input type="text" id="field" name="field"/>
[23:33:12] <krz> how do i append after a div
[23:33:56] <StPiere> krz, $(insert element).insertAfter('div')
[23:34:11] <c_t_montgomery> StPiere: you need to use a keyDown event handler, then test and see if the event's keyCode is equal to 9 (tab keyCode) (making a jsfiddle right now to show you)
[23:34:21] <krz> thnx
[23:34:25] <StPiere> thanks c_t_montgomery
[23:34:35] <StPiere> krz, welcome
[23:36:37] <StPiere> c_t_montgomery, i want to input in the field the text \t  , not the tab
[23:37:01] <c_t_montgomery> ah, so if you type \t, not press tab?
[23:37:06] <StPiere> yes
