[00:01:22] <coldhead> joshualibrarian: http://jsfiddle.net/sEjfR/4/
[00:01:26] <coldhead> missing a #
[00:01:35] <coldhead> and jQuery, not Jquery
[00:01:48] <coldhead> also declare before using
[00:02:33] <joshualibrarian> coldhead:  I see... declare before using...
[00:02:50] <earlyMorning> I have a little (~500 lines of code) jquerymobile app fully working. I need someone with a good knowledge of jquery to add few functions to that app, today, in about 3-4 hours. If you think you can do it, pm to discuss how much it will cost me
[00:03:40] * joshualibrarian sighs... doesn't explain why my actual code isn't working though...
[00:04:12] <Monkeypaws> coldhead - i had to make it 	if($("input#spectator").is(':checked'))   'spectator' is the label of the checkbox
[00:05:17] <Monkeypaws> ty for the help
[00:08:56] <coldhead> joshualibrarian: did you see how my version with the code reordered and the bugs removed actually worked?
[00:09:10] <coldhead> does that still not clear it up?
[00:10:11] <Xotix> hi
[00:10:25] <joshualibrarian> coldhead: no, you fixed the test case... but my actual widget in my actual code still isn't running...  very strange seeming behavior...
[00:10:53] <Whirl3d> Xotix, hi
[00:11:03] <Xotix> what could cause tbodyChildren.eq(0).outerHeight(true) to give me a wrong height?
[00:15:07] <joshualibrarian> coldhead: http://regenerativefuture.org
[00:15:57] <joshualibrarian> coldhead: the console.log statement in the index.html works which is right before the call to the widget... however, the console.log statement in the _create of the widget isn't running.  :(
[00:16:06] <Whirl3d> does .eq() return the dom element?
[00:16:31] <Whirl3d> nope.
[00:16:45] <systemfault> It returns a wrapped node.
[00:16:54] <systemfault> .get does what you want
[00:17:28] <Whirl3d> I was looking at xotix's question. I always get .get and .eq mixed up for some reason.
[00:17:34] <Whirl3d> xotix do you have a fiddle to look at?
[00:18:23] <Xotix> Whril3D yes. No, i'll try to create one.
[00:18:47] <Validatorian> I'm making a browser extension, and I want to detect when google is redrawing post (like what happens when you scroll to the very bottom of https://plus.google.com/ and it loads more posts automatically) -- anyone have a suggestion on how to detect this?
[00:19:17] <Whirl3d> handle the scroll event
[00:19:47] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, cna you give me a hand? http://jsfiddle.net/Nuypz/2/
[00:20:04] <wodemaye_> the (X) button is broken.
[00:20:12] <Validatorian> how do you mean, Whirl3d
[00:20:49] <wodemaye_> paste a valid link in the box, and press tab.  then you can try scrolling with red arrows.
[00:21:30] <wodemaye_> but when you click X the $('#none').click() handler seems to execute, then un-execute if that makes sense.
[00:21:35] <wodemaye_> i mean its work becomes undone.
[00:21:49] <wodemaye_> and what it produces on the page gets destroyed somehow.
[00:23:19] <coldhead> joshualibrarian: it works when i run it from the console
[00:23:19] <joshualibrarian> If I change the name of the function, it errors out, so clearly it SEES the function... but it just doesn't seem to be running!
[00:23:19] <Whirl3d> your handler for $("#none") never gets called
[00:23:32] <coldhead> which means you probably need to wrap your code in .ready()
[00:23:37] <joshualibrarian> coldhead: huh?
[00:23:42] <joshualibrarian> coldhead!
[00:23:44] <joshualibrarian> oooooooh
[00:23:52] <coldhead> ?ready
[00:23:52] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[00:24:56] <joshualibrarian> coldhead:  aaah!  that was it.
[00:25:30] * joshualibrarian had been messing with that for like two hours!  THANK YOU!
[00:26:19] <Whirl3d> actually, wodemaye_, it seems to work for me...
[00:26:29] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Nuypz/5/
[00:28:19] <Whirl3d> wodemaye_, it even adds the second thumbnail, just doesn't show it  (access it with next)
[00:28:50] <coldhead> joshualibrarian: happy hacking!
[00:32:03] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, not for me.
[00:32:07] <wodemaye_> i'm uploading screenshots.
[00:32:59] <coldhead> i'm having a nosebleed
[00:33:56] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, http://imgur.com/a/SKVI7
[00:34:00] <wodemaye_> coldhead, sorry to hear that.
[00:34:29] <coldhead> eh i'm enjoying it, frankly
[00:34:47] <Whirl3d> wodemaye_, maybe I'm missing you, what is it supposed to do?
[00:35:12] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, loading: http://i.imgur.com/Rx1Rnh.png
[00:35:23] <wodemaye_> upon pasting URL: http://i.imgur.com/M6wZV.png
[00:35:44] <Whirl3d> it does that
[00:35:53] <wodemaye_> <1 second after pasting URL (technicall after blurring box too.) http://i.imgur.com/ZyZ0Sh.png
[00:36:07] <wodemaye_> and then 2 seconds after blurring linkbox:
[00:36:15] <wodemaye_> http://i.imgur.com/Rx1Rnh.png
[00:36:30] <wodemaye_> oops, i screwed uip the annotations.
[00:36:37] <Whirl3d> so, it's supposed to clear the image just loaded when you click x
[00:37:49] <robban666> Anybody know where I can find a plugin that will add widgets to a frontpage(dashboard), and also order them on the frontpage.
[00:38:19] <wodemaye_> I get this: http://i.imgur.com/Rx1Rnh.png, paste/blur and get this: http://i.imgur.com/M6wZV.png, but sadly only for a split second before it dissappears again to return to this: http://i.imgur.com/Rx1Rnh.png.
[00:39:24] <dr0id> lol u uze jquery?
[00:39:26] <Whirl3d> did you want the new thumbs to be added to the list of existing thumbs or to replace them?
[00:39:58] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, basically, it's a link sharer.
[00:40:24] <Whirl3d> so yes or no on the replace thumbs?
[00:40:26] <wodemaye_> You paste a link, and it suggests images.  This is a static suggestion set for the thumbnails, and assumes you pasted enwp.org/Thomas_Jefferson.
[00:40:37] <Whirl3d> got ya
[00:40:42] <wodemaye_> If you don't like any of the suggested thumbnails, then you hit the (X).
[00:40:43] <thinkerbell> I used jquery ui's show effect fade and fade works, meanwhile when I browse jquery ui's show() effects, fade isn't one of them, wierd, I wonder what other effects work but are not listed
[00:40:50] <Whirl3d> and you select your favorite img to represent it
[00:40:51] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, still with me?
[00:40:56] <wodemaye_> Exactly.
[00:41:03] <Whirl3d> gimme a minute
[00:41:14] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, yuhuh.
[00:43:27] <Xotix> Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/LKgjZ/ the code is quite old. Make the result window big.  But somehow, in jsfiddle it is correct.
[00:52:16] <Morteza_ipo> ohi
[00:52:17] <Morteza_ipo> hi
[00:52:29] <Morteza_ipo> my jquery cant work in IE
[00:52:30] <Morteza_ipo> $('select[name=group_id] option').click(function(){
[00:52:40] <Morteza_ipo> which part have problem?
[00:52:54] <wodemaye_> Morteza_ipo, dude, just don't support IE.
[00:52:56] <rohanrhu> hello
[00:52:58] <rohanrhu> i need help
[00:53:22] <Cork> Morteza_ipo: ie doens't support events on options
[00:53:28] <Morteza_ipo> wodemaye_: how to solve it?
[00:53:42] <Morteza_ipo> Cork: how to solve it?
[00:53:44] <Cork> you would have to check on select and calculate the mouse position
[00:54:06] <Cork> options isn't a real element in ie
[00:54:18] <Morteza_ipo> Cork : $('select[name=group_id]').click(function(){
[00:54:18] <Morteza_ipo> ?
[00:54:24] <Cork> they merge into a native dropdown
[00:54:27] <wodemaye_> Morteza_ipo, by scrapping IE.
[00:54:33] <Cork> Morteza_ipo: yes
[00:54:42] <rohanrhu> $.ajax is working from page at localhost but it's returning empty on the webhost
[00:54:43] <Cork> then event.pageX
[00:54:44] <Morteza_ipo> wodemaya: scrapping?
[00:55:07] <rohanrhu> can you help me?
[00:55:19] <Morteza_ipo> Cork: really? I think it is'nt good
[00:55:21] <Cork> rohanrhu: your requesting same domain?
[00:55:46] <rohanrhu> Cork: yes it's working on localhost but it's not working on same domain
[00:55:58] <Cork> rohanrhu: thats not what i asked
[00:56:13] <Cork> rohanrhu: your ajax call is it aimed at the same domain as your page?
[00:57:07] <Morteza_ipo> how to run a function if user browser is IE?
[00:57:25] <Morteza_ipo> on click event
[00:57:36] <coldhead> ?browser
[00:57:37] <bot-t> jQuery.browser: Contains flags for the useragent, read from navigator.userAgent. We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser may be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[00:57:45] <rohanrhu> Cork: $.ajax and form action url are in the different two domain
[00:57:50] <Cork> Morteza_ipo: you could $.browser, but feature detection is normally the recomended solution
[00:58:00] <Cork> rohanrhu: then thats your problem
[00:58:08] <Cork> rohanrhu: ajax isn't allowed cross domain
[00:58:26] <Cork> rohanrhu: it needs to be on the same domain
[00:58:40] <Xotix> Cork he can with some workarounds
[00:58:42] <Morteza_ipo> Cork : you said me work with pageX! this is not stable!
[00:58:53] <Cork> Xotix: not workarounds that work in all browsers
[00:59:00] <Morteza_ipo> coldhead: yes
[00:59:17] <rohanrhu> Cork: what can be do?
[00:59:30] <Cork> rohanrhu: proxy it on your site
[00:59:39] <wodemaye_> coldhead, could you give me a quick hand?
[00:59:40] <Xotix> Cork, of course. Porbably he has to use 2 workaorounds, one for ie one for the others.
[00:59:57] <Cork> Xotix: ya, and one of them could just be used for all of them
[01:00:06] <coldhead> not just the moment wodemaye_, found a gross bug in my own coads
[01:00:19] <wodemaye_> coldhead, eww.
[01:00:29] <wodemaye_> good luck.
[01:00:39] <wodemaye_> yt, Whirl3d ?
[01:00:44] <Xotix> Cork doesn't jquery.form.js support al lbrowser and falslback on the iframe hack for ie?
[01:00:56] <Cork> Xotix: not for cross domain
[01:01:28] <Cork> XDomainRequest is broken if you want to submit a form
[01:01:42] <Cork> and iframes can't get data if you want to send to a different domain
[01:01:53] <Whirl3d> wodemaye_, sorry. gimme just a second. I'm reworking your stuff to try it a different way.
[01:02:19] <rohanrhu> Cork: ok then i must write a php with curl for return action url's content
[01:02:21] <Xotix> Cork h yeah. Iirc i used xhrDomainRequest for IE and for all other brwoser i've used cors. he also could just set the document.domain = 'foo.com';
[01:02:44] <Cork> Xotix: document.domain only works for sub domains
[01:02:55] <wodemaye_> Whirl3d, no worries.
[01:03:24] <Morteza_ipo> Thanks guys
[01:03:25] <Morteza_ipo> bye
[01:03:31] <Cork> Xotix: and like i said xdomainrequest is broken as you can't send x-www-form-urlencoded
[01:03:39] <Xotix> Cork, hmm? if he hass foo1.bar.com and foo2.bar.com and he sets it to bar.com, they can talk but i don't know how limited.
[01:03:44] <Cork> and most severs depends on it
[01:03:55] <Cork> Xotix: thats sub domain ya
[01:03:57] <Xotix> Cork, he can parse it on php side with 2 lines of code.
[01:04:13] <Cork> Xotix: sigh. ya and thats my original sugestion
[01:04:36] <Cork> its the only cross browser solution for the moment
[01:06:27] <Xotix> rohanrhu: e.g.             $postdata = file_get_contents("php://input");  parse_str($postdata, $_POST);  the post data must be encoded like get vars.
[01:10:40] <itatitat> I've a problem
[01:10:47] <itatitat> I'm using some libreries (datepicker, etc)
[01:10:59] <itatitat> the problem is that I want to use those libreries with a new content loaded by ajax with load()
[01:11:35] <itatitat> and doesnt work
[01:13:37] <Xotix> I'm having a problem getting the correct height. It worked, the code s quite old but something is now different and causes it to breake. http://tinyw.in/BLrg click on show at newsletter 543. open js console and refresh. any idea? Atm, I'm using height(); but it doesn't matter, it always gives me the same.
[01:15:22] <Xotix> if you type $('#editor > table > tbody').children().height() into the console it gives you the correct height
[01:17:42] <chx> what is the simplest way to get the page reload on a 403 ajax error?
[01:18:34] <Whirl3d> crap. What's dom exception 8
[01:19:46] <Xotix> chx $ajax has statusCode:
[01:19:53] <Xotix> never used it, check docs.
[01:21:46] <lb> which part of the formelement does the serializeArray() function use to make it the key in the encodedstring? the name or the id attribute of the element?
[01:22:23] <Xotix> lb check the source?
[01:23:02] <lb> willdo, thought it would be faster if somebody around here knows it ;)
[01:24:11] <lb> Xotix: ok it's using the name attribute
[01:26:01] <NodeX> it uses name... I'ds cannot have [] as they are illegal chars
[01:26:20] <NodeX> id's *
[01:29:07] <itatitat> ey guys
[01:29:19] <itatitat> why after to load new content by using load()
[01:29:30] <itatitat> my functions doesnt work?
[01:29:34] <Woet> ?demo @ itatitat
[01:29:34] <bot-t> itatitat, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:30:58] <joshualibrarian> coldhead:  why oh why does my text not wrap?  It wraps when I don't call the widget!  http://regenerativefuture.org
[01:33:02] <Cork> joshualibrarian: #intro gemoves position: absolute
[01:33:07] <Cork> *becomes
[01:33:10] <itatitat> this is the idea
[01:33:10] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/8hC2R/
[01:33:26] <itatitat> I cant put all the code because is heavy
[01:33:30] <itatitat> but the idea is that
[01:33:51] <joshualibrarian> Cork:  and it sholdn't?  but it's width is still set.
[01:35:19] <Cork> joshualibrarian: the parent is width: 3204px
[01:35:35] <joshualibrarian> Oh!
[01:35:36] <Cork> and intro doesn't have a width or right
[01:35:58] <Cork> absolute positioned element doens't have reference to the content
[01:36:08] <Cork> so it will adjust to the width of the content
[01:36:12] <Cork> (of its content)
[01:36:20] <Woet> itatitat: please create a live WORKING demo
[01:36:40] <itatitat> ok, but in that demo there is a library...
[01:36:46] <itatitat> can I make anyway?
[01:36:59] <Cork> joshualibrarian: not sure how panels, works, never used it, but the set values will more or less ensure that the text won't ever wrap
[01:37:11] <Woet> itatitat: for starters, pick jquery instead of motools.
[01:37:15] <Woet> itatitat: yes, it works fine
[01:37:22] <itatitat> oh perfect
[01:37:56] <woozly> guys, how to wait until $.ajax data comes back?
[01:37:56] <joshualibrarian> Cork: YAHA!  I added a set for the width of the panel as I set it to absolute, to the original panel width, not the triple big one.  It worked great!  :)
[01:38:16] <woozly> I need to wrote some func, like: var data = getAjaxData('somescript.php');
[01:38:25] <woozly> and then work with 'data' var
[01:38:38] <woozly> async: false not working :(
[01:38:45] <woozly> method: 'POST'
[01:38:53] <woozly> type: POST i mean
[01:39:27] <Xotix> I ave some code which gets the height and does something. It gets triggered on load and later on by user actions. If it was triggered by the suer action, it works but if it get triggered within load it doesn't. the height is wrong. why?after load, the dom doesn't change anymore (expect i do it with js) correct?
[01:39:31] <azk> can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/jsyRn/1/ I get variable undefined or NaN errors on the second function even though I observe the db call to be correct?
[01:44:18] <Dr-Bombay> xotix: it's triggered on load of what, and checks the height of what
[01:44:54] <Whirl3d> wodemaye_, pm me
[01:46:14] <itatitat> ey guys
[01:46:21] <itatitat> a question about jsfiddle
[01:46:32] <itatitat> is possible to add a new panel for example for html?
[01:46:58] <wodemaye_> itatitat, the topleft one is for html.
[01:47:10] <Xotix> Dr-Bombay: basically this http://pastebin.com/kFvgJGNG the same function gets triggered by some sortable. and then it is correct. but triggered liek that, it's wrong
[01:47:15] <itatitat> yes...but im using load() in my example, so I need another html
[01:47:20] <itatitat> to make a demo
[01:48:01] <Woet> itatitat: "testing ajax requests" has it's own pane on the left.
[01:48:14] <itatitat> oooooggg
[01:48:15] <itatitat> genial
[01:48:46] <_dave_h_d> hi all, is(':animated') does not seem to work on mobile safari if you click twice fast enough, anyone know of a solution to this problem?
[01:49:41] <_dave_h_d> or tap rather
[01:50:14] <Xotix> Dr-Bombay:  i can give you a demo.
[01:53:55] <chx> what is the simplest way to get the page reload on a 403 ajax error in jQuery 1.4? statuscode is 1.5.
[01:54:45] <Xotix> get it yourself, check the source of 1.5 or return a string by the server containing the code.
[01:55:29] <Cork> chx: attach an error handler and redo the ajax call on status 403
[01:56:30] <Xotix> Cork the problem is detecting the 403 i think
[01:57:16] <Cork> $.ajax().error(function(xhr) { if(xhr.status === 403) {} });
[01:57:48] <chx> thanks.
[02:01:51] <itatitat> fuck
[02:01:56] <itatitat> I cant create my example with ajax
[02:02:00] <itatitat> in jsfiddle
[02:02:05] <Cork> you can
[02:02:17] <Cork> it has ajax callbacks
[02:02:29] <Cork> check the options in the left bar
[02:02:33] <Tram> Good morning all, anyone knows if its possible to make a jquery function, that when you press a button in a div, that you can find out the ID of the div the button is in?
[02:03:06] <Woet> Tram: yes, that is possible.
[02:03:11] <Cork> Tram: is the function meant to be called from a click on the button?
[02:03:21] <Xotix> Tram $(this).attr(id)
[02:03:29] <Cork> Xotix: no
[02:03:34] <phryk> I am trying to add an event listener to an element I added with .append(). Strangely this doesn't work at all.
[02:03:34] <Cork> read the question
[02:04:18] <Tram> Yes Cork, i'll make a jsifddle example
[02:04:19] <Tram> sec
[02:04:30] <nFFF> $(this).closest('div').attr('id')
[02:04:36] <phryk> Even when I use a totally generic selector like 'li', all <li>-elements trigger the defined event handler, only the <li> elements I added with append() not.
[02:04:42] <rethus> how can i load a pdf-file into a modal-dialoge?
[02:04:49] <Cork> Tram: make sure to reproduce the nesting your planing to use
[02:04:54] <phryk> Oh wait, I actually append later on…
[02:05:11] <rethus> i only got the sourcecode of the file if i do $("#dialoge1").load("bild1.pdf").dialog({modal:true});
[02:05:18] <Cork> phryk: use delegated event listners
[02:05:27] <phryk> delegated?
[02:05:37] <Cork> phryk: it makes the page faster too
[02:05:40] <Cork> ?.delegate
[02:05:41] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:05:43] <Cork> ?.on
[02:05:46] <bot-t> Cork, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:05:49] <Cork> (check the delegate section)
[02:05:49] <phryk> I'm sorrym, I'm not very much into js.
[02:07:31] <phryk> Cork: Ah, thanks lemme try that :)
[02:08:05] <itatitat> why my ajax in jsfiddle doesnt work?, i saw the documentation
[02:08:12] <itatitat> is the same example than another
[02:08:13] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/ysK2Q/5/
[02:08:52] <phryk> Cork: Does the element I have as 'this' in the delegate call already have to exist?
[02:08:56] <Cork> itatitat: request.HTML isn't jquery
[02:09:03] <itatitat> ouch
[02:09:12] <Tram> Here is the example of the 'find out in what div the button that got clicked is in' :http://jsfiddle.net/YnaXz/ i really hope someone can help me
[02:09:20] <Cork> phryk: no, the event function is called when the event is triggered
[02:09:29] <phryk> (for instance ('ul#foo').delegate <-- the ul#foo, does this already have to exist?)
[02:09:34] <phryk> ah, okay
[02:09:43] <Cork> phryk: no
[02:09:59] <Cork> ul#foo need to exist
[02:10:18] <Cork> its when you add as selector in the delegated function that doesn't need to exist
[02:10:19] <Bubbi> Hey Ya'll, is there a specific channel for "jQuery Mobile help" or is it also in this channel?
[02:11:10] <phryk> Ah, okay, then I'll have to build a little hashmap first :)
[02:11:38] <Cork> Tram: http://jsfiddle.net/YnaXz/1/
[02:11:56] <Monkeypaws> does window unload not work in chrome?
[02:12:10] <Cork> phryk: this in the event will be the element you match
[02:12:26] <Cork> phryk: and if your using farly new jquery use on instead
[02:13:16] <Cork> phryk: $('#existingParent').on('click', 'li', function() { this.nodeType == 'LI' });
[02:14:57] <joshualibrarian> When I cal $(selector).css({}) does it wipe out the existing css tags on the element?
[02:15:07] <Cork> no
[02:15:25] <itatitat> ok........is not jquery
[02:15:30] <itatitat> ................how is using jquery?
[02:15:39] <itatitat> because I'm using only load()
[02:15:45] <Cork> itatitat: use similar data points but use $.ajax
[02:16:03] <Tram> thanks Cork, you are the best!
[02:16:06] <itatitat> ok
[02:16:11] <Bubbi> Using jQuery Mobile, I need to get the height of an element on the 'pageinit' event (recommended for jQuery Mobile), i've tried with $('#element').width(), but it returns 0. It is as if the element is hidden when the 'pageinit' event is running. Does anybody have any help as what I might be doing wrong?
[02:16:35] <Monkeypaws> I need a way to delete an entry from the database if a user exits the page, i was going to use .unload but that isn't working.  Any way to do something like this when the user leaves?
[02:17:20] <Bubbi> joshualibrarian: If you want to delete the entire style-tag, then you can $(selector).attr('style','');
[02:17:31] <Bubbi> joshualibrarian: actually there is a removeAttr()
[02:17:48] <Bubbi> joshualibrarian: so you can do this: $(selector).removeAttr('style')
[02:18:08] <joshualibrarian> Bubbi: I actually wanted the opposite, I was suspecting that my call to css was removing the existing size.
[02:18:35] <joshualibrarian> nope.  :(
[02:19:23] <Bubbi> joshualibrarian: ah okay :-) But short answer is, as Cork wrote: No (it does not remove existing css)
[02:19:29] <Cork> itatitat: http://jsfiddle.net/ysK2Q/7/
[02:21:37] <Bubbi> Monkeypaws: There is a onbeforeunload(). But the thing is, that when a user leaves a page, it is not alway going to allow a HTTP request (I haven't figured out yet, how to do it)
[02:22:01] <lb> oh thanks NodeX , did't see it up there because there were no highlight and i was focusing on my work again.
[02:22:51] <Bubbi> Anybody here have experience with jQuery Mobile..? I'm in need of some assistance with getting the dimensions of an element on 'pageinit', and all I seem to get, is 0px..
[02:23:21] <Cork> Bubbi: might be the elements are hidden when you check them
[02:23:45] <Cork> Bubbi: never used jquery mobile so can't say
[02:25:16] <rethus> how can i display the image in a dialoge with this script: http://jsfiddle.net/pbFes/1/
[02:25:35] <Bubbi> Cork: Yes, it exactly seems as if they are, but as far as I can read from the documentation, the 'pageinit' event is the equavalent to the 'ready' event for standard jQuery. And I can't really find any documentation as what to use then..
[02:25:38] <Monkeypaws> Bubbi - would it run a script?
[02:26:45] <itatitat> thanks Cork:
[02:27:10] <Bubbi> Monkeypaws: Yep, it would be able to run a script, but I have had some trouble with it aborting XHR (Ajax-requests), when the page exists
[02:27:16] <Cork> rethus: http://jsfiddle.net/pbFes/2/
[02:27:17] <Monkeypaws> ok
[02:27:39] <xenaxon> formbutton_id.substr(-8,8);
[02:27:48] <xenaxon> how do I make substr return me only the rest of the string
[02:27:52] <xenaxon> without the last 8 characters
[02:27:52] <xenaxon> ?
[02:27:56] <Cork> rethus: you might want to delay that dialog('open') until the image is loaded
[02:28:17] <rethus> Cork: thanks. but the image is still open in a new window
[02:28:50] <Cork> rethus: that doens't make sence
[02:29:33] <rethus> i wan't to open it in the dialoge. but if i click on your jsfiddle-code on a image, it opens in a new browser-window
[02:29:36] <Cork> rethus: you don't have jquery ui on jsfiddle so if you mean there its another matter
[02:30:05] <Lachezar> Hello. Is there a jQuery plug-in for AJAX-Suggest of objects (ID and Name pairs)? Suggest and Autocomplete plugins work only for name fields.
[02:30:13] <rethus> ah, ok. sorry. i don't mind that it was a jquery-ui-feature
[02:30:35] <Cork> rethus: http://jsfiddle.net/pbFes/3/
[02:30:41] <Cork> the css is still missing thought
[02:30:44] <Cork> *though
[02:30:58] <Lachezar> !!autocomplete
[02:31:03] <phryk> Cork: $("ul#bscontrols-" + index).delegate is not a function :(
[02:31:21] <Cork> phryk: what version of jquery are you using?
[02:31:23] <Bubbi> Lachezar: There are a few plugins for that. jQuery UI contains one, that is quite good, but I recommend searching on google for some other variants, if you need something else. just search for "jQuery Autocomplete"
[02:31:25] <phryk> Cork: the selector is not the problem, I tried it with just $('ul')
[02:31:42] <phryk> Cork: 1.3.2
[02:31:48] <Cork> ugg thats old
[02:31:49] <phryk> argh
[02:32:02] <phryk> I just saw at the documentation of delegate() …
[02:32:07] <Cork> it predates delegate
[02:32:24] <Cork> you might be able to use live
[02:32:25] <Lachezar> Bubbi: I'm here after I searched Google. Didn't find one that uses a pair of fields for the ID and Name. Only plugins for completing text-as-you-type, which is _not_ what I need :-/
[02:32:26] <Poetro> it has live though
[02:32:26] * Cork checks
[02:32:36] <phryk> Cork: live?
[02:32:37] <Poetro> i think it was 1.2.6
[02:32:39] <Cork> ya, barly
[02:32:41] <Poetro> or something
[02:32:43] <Cork> no 1.3
[02:32:48] <Cork> ?.live @ phryk
[02:32:49] <bot-t> phryk, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[02:32:55] <Lachezar> Bubbi: There is such a component built on top of prototype, but I'm trying to migrate to jQuery.
[02:32:57] <MikeH> Hi, if I have a load of checkboxes, is there an easy, efficient way to see if they are all checked? They are setup as an "array" and all have the same class defined.
[02:33:01] <itatitat> OK
[02:33:04] <itatitat> here is my example
[02:33:07] <itatitat> finally
[02:33:09] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/ysK2Q/9/
[02:33:11] <Cork> phryk: you should try to update jquery thought
[02:33:27] <phryk> Cork: the version is pretty much bound to the cms, which is a really old version of drupal.
[02:33:44] <phryk> (Not my choice, sadly I can't do anything about it)
[02:33:45] <egrouse> sounds exploitable!
[02:33:56] * egrouse leet hax
[02:34:15] <phryk> egrouse: If you'd have seen how that thing is set up, the old cms version would be the least of your concerns…
[02:34:20] <phryk> Gladly I'm not the admin.
[02:34:21] <egrouse> :)
[02:34:35] <phryk> Well if I was it'd be set up a lot better anyways :D
[02:34:52] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/ysK2Q/10/
[02:34:54] <Cork> phryk: check jquery_update
[02:34:55] <Bubbi> Lachezar: complete-as-you-type is the "base" functionality, but most of them have the option of inserting key/value in each of their own fields. I have used this one (a bit outdated, but still working): http://jquery.bassistance.de/autocomplete/demo/  try the "single bird (remote), to see an example
[02:35:04] <Cork> ?g drupal jquery_update @ phryk
[02:35:05] <bot-t> phryk, jQuery Update | drupal.org - http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update
[02:35:24] <phryk> also: why does jquery accumulate a huge load of functions that basically do the same thing?
[02:35:30] <phryk> like delegate, on and live ?
[02:35:46] <Cork> phryk: they'r depricated in 1.7
[02:35:51] <egrouse> i thought similar about the servers we were given to use at Uni to host are uni work… they were so outdated, like bash v2 and shit
[02:36:00] <Cork> phryk: but its backwards compatibility
[02:36:15] <phryk> Cork: jquery update is already installed, I'll check if it has the lates version though…
[02:36:18] <Cork> phryk: its just 3 lines of code, so not much cost
[02:36:24] <Poetro> MikeH: var checkboxes = $('#checkboxes').find('input[type=checkbox]'); alert(checkboxes.length === checkboxes.filter(':checked').length)
[02:36:35] <phryk> Cork: Still, confusing about the API :P
[02:36:40] * phryk likes stable APIs
[02:36:59] <Cork> phryk: first a plugin implemented .live
[02:37:14] <MikeH> Poetro: I figured out a different way pretty much immediately, but thank you. I appreciate the help.
[02:37:15] <Cork> phryk: it was liked to it more or less got imported into jquery
[02:37:30] <Ricaz> Anyone got experience using the slider plugin for UI?
[02:37:41] <Cork> phryk: it has its problems with its structure though, so it was modified to delegate (thats a much better syntax)
[02:37:44] <Ricaz> It behaves very weird.
[02:37:45] <phryk> Cork: also jquery_update is at the latest version for d6 (Drupal 6 to jQuery 1.3.2)
[02:38:05] <Cork> phryk: and all of them has been replaced with on in 1.7
[02:38:10] <phryk> I like that it's being cleaned up though. :)
[02:38:11] <Cork> phryk: sucks
[02:38:26] <phryk> Cork: I'll do it with live then.
[02:38:39] <Cork> phryk: not sure what i think about on, the removal of live is good though
[02:38:48] <Cork> phryk: only solution
[02:38:48] <phryk> My backup plan would've been to add the function calls hardcoded into the generated html i append() :P
[02:39:01] <phryk> But I'd like to get around that, since it's ugly as heck.
[02:39:31] <Cork> phryk: live has the same syntax as bind
[02:39:32] <phryk> Cork: Any clue how long the API is going to be stable from now on? (If I start developing with the current 1.7 version)
[02:40:10] <Cork> phryk: phryk: 1.5 1.7 broke some backwards compatibility
[02:40:18] <Cork> part from that its been quite stable for me
[02:40:38] <Cork> 1.5 actually broke it so bad a site i have is still on 1.4 cause of it
[02:40:42] <itatitat> ey!, someones can help me?, I've made a demo, but I dont know why fail my code.
[02:40:44] <kwilliams> Hey guys, could anyone tell me why this statement would evaluate as false in the context of the last element of the tags_en[] collection?
[02:40:45] <kwilliams> $(this) == $('input[name="tags_en[]"]:last'
[02:40:57] <kwilliams> $(this) == $('input[name="tags_en[]"]:last']) *
[02:41:11] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/ysK2Q/12/
[02:41:13] <Cork> this === $('input[name="tags_en[]"]:last'])[0]
[02:41:19] <Cork> kwilliams: ^
[02:41:27] <kwilliams> Ah nice.
[02:41:39] <Ricaz> Anyone got experience using the slider plugin for UI?
[02:41:41] <Cork> kwilliams: objects is always uniq if you create a new one
[02:41:53] <Cork> kwilliams: dom objects can be compared though
[02:42:15] <gurde> hi
[02:42:52] <gurde> in IE, why when loading an image in the load() callback the .complete is always false?
[02:42:58] <phryk> Cork: Sounds fair enough. My first jquery stuff is likely to get replaced by me within ~6months or so anyways :P
[02:43:08] <joshualibrarian> If I have a jquery collection of div's, how can I neatly fetch them all, I need to see all their heights...
[02:43:38] <Cork> phryk: if i remember correctly 1.3 broke a lot of stuff for me back then
[02:44:01] <Cork> don't have any of those stuff left though :)
[02:44:07] <NodeX> josh .. $('div');
[02:44:47] <Xotix> how can i disable the scrolling o the parent window when the scrolling is at its max in the cild window without disableing it in the parent window (stupid to support for all brwosers)
[02:44:51] <Cork> gurde: you mean you set the src on an image tag in the loaded html?
[02:45:05] <gurde> no
[02:45:19] <Poetro> itatitat: what do u mean u do not know?
[02:45:31] <phryk> Cork: How long did it take from 1.3 to 1.5 and from 1.5 to 1.7? I guess there's at least 2 years between each?
[02:45:45] <itatitat> after to add the new link
[02:45:52] <itatitat> I need to run the script of thickbox
[02:45:58] <gurde> Cork: i have this: $(new Image()).load(render).attr('src', src); in render() { this.complete -> always false }
[02:46:01] <itatitat> but I dont know why is not working
[02:46:12] <Cork> phryk: http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Past_Releases
[02:46:13] <gurde> but just with IE
[02:46:19] <Poetro> itatitat: what is NOT working?
[02:47:13] <itatitat> OK. At first I make click in a link. This link by load()-ajax, add a new content from another page. In this content there is another link. This link need to run an script, thickbox
[02:47:23] <phryk> Cork: Thanks for the info :)
[02:47:24] <gurde> Cork: any ideas?
[02:47:32] <Cork> gurde: not sure, that sounds like it should work
[02:47:45] <itatitat> this link using thinkbox load a new content (ajax again) to show the content in a nice window with dark background
[02:48:02] <gurde> well, in ie 8 it always gives me false
[02:48:24] <itatitat> but I dont know why this script (and the rest of my page), dont run scripts after to be loaded by ajax
[02:48:50] <itatitat> im reading a lot, and studying, but I cant guess the solution...
[02:49:18] <Bubbi> Lachezar: Were you able to use the link I sent you?
[02:49:43] <yannickoo> hey guys, can you tell me why the ul closes when i hover english? http://jsfiddle.net/9B4hc/2/
[02:50:21] <Cork> gurde: btw why do you need to check this.complete?
[02:50:37] <Cork> gurde: the .load event means the image is loaded, so why check it again?
[02:51:11] <gurde> Cork: in IE8 there is a strange behaviour
[02:51:41] <kwilliams> Cork: Don't suppose you could be awesome enough to explain why this returns -1 in the context of a $('input[name="tags_en[]"]') element?
[02:51:44] <kwilliams> index = $('input[name="tags_en"]').index(this);
[02:51:57] <rethus> Cork: now i try to set iframe with the link. but something seems not to work... did you see where my misstake is? http://jsfiddle.net/pbFes/4/
[02:51:59] <gurde> Cork: can i give you a link?
[02:52:00] <kwilliams> Not very experienced with object arrays in jQuery :(
[02:52:36] <Cork> kwilliams: name="tags_en[]" != name="tags_en"
[02:52:39] <gurde> Cork: https://gurde.com/2012/02/zoom-jquery-photo-gallery-plugin/ using IE8 click the images at the end of the article
[02:52:58] <kwilliams> I know, but all the elements are called tags_en[].
[02:53:08] <kwilliams> So they become an array at the backend.
[02:53:17] <gurde> after it opens use arrow keys to navigate, after a while the container is not getting resized, don't know why
[02:53:24] <Cork> kwilliams: you might want name^="tags_en"

[02:54:13] <yannickoo> xec_: cool thanks, but can you tell me my misstake?
[02:54:16] <Cork> kwilliams: the name must match exactly if your using =
[02:54:48] <xec_> yannickoo: mouseout triggers on child elements (the li) as well, iirc
[02:55:02] <yannickoo> thanks
[02:55:47] <xec_> yannickoo: you could also use mouseleave instead
[02:55:49] <kwilliams> Cork: Never mind, was a problem between my keyboard and chair. Forgot the [] in the selection tag.
[02:56:01] <Cork> :)
[02:57:21] <gurde> Cork: can you please take a look?
[02:57:27] <phryk> Cork: I seem to be too stupid about js… http://npaste.de/nE4/ With this I get two alerts (showing 0 and 1), but blockslideShow is always called with 1 as the value of the second argument… :(
[02:58:14] <Cork> gurde: sorry i don't have the time to dig through a plugin
[02:58:38] <Cork> phryk: you only use the live selector once
[02:58:49] <gurde> i wrote it
[02:58:51] <Cork> phryk: you need to make it handle all elements that match your selector
[02:58:59] <itatitat> is like if ajax only worked the first time
[02:59:08] <itatitat> to load the first content, and in the second time no...
[02:59:35] <gurde> Cork: the code is here: https://gurde.com/wp-content/themes/gurde/js/zoom.js
[02:59:50] <gurde> Cork: method render()
[03:00:33] <phryk> Cork: The selector is different for each call… I want different <li> elements to call the same function, but with different arguments…
[03:02:23] <Poetro> itatitat: you have to run the scripts by yourself
[03:02:33] <Poetro> jQuery will not run any script returned by AJAX
[03:02:48] <rethus> why is the dialoge with my iframe not shown? http://jsfiddle.net/pbFes/7/
[03:04:07] <Poetro> rethus: b/c it has no content?
[03:04:40] <gurde> Cork: the thing is, sometimes the width and height of the image is 0, but just in IE8, that is why I checked .complete property
[03:04:45] <itatitat> ok!
[03:04:48] <gurde> Cork: do you have another suggestion?
[03:05:30] <rethus>  Poetro: the image should be shows, which is in the href as link
[03:05:35] <itatitat> yes, I know there is an error because I need another html file
[03:05:45] <itatitat> but in my computer I've that file
[03:06:01] <itatitat> that file only have plain html
[03:06:06] <itatitat> Poetro:
[03:06:31] <Xotix> I have an div within that div an ul. i want to make that ul scrollable. what plugin does support this?
[03:06:48] <itatitat> the problem is that with new content recently added with ajax, functions (using again ajax) dont work
[03:06:53] <Poetro> rethus: but the dialog is over the links, so u cannot click on those
[03:06:58] <itatitat> I dont understand what happen
[03:08:04] <Poetro> itatitat: after the HTML is loaded, u need to initialize the lightbox after the append
[03:08:16] <itatitat> wowow....................................
[03:08:30] <itatitat> with document.ready()?
[03:08:41] <Poetro> the docuemtn is already ready
[03:08:50] <itatitat> with trigger?
[03:08:56] <Poetro> so u just have to run code after the .append(data)
[03:09:15] <Poetro> i dont know if trigger will help
[03:09:20] <itatitat> jummmmmmmmmmmmm, ok, is logic
[03:09:23] <Poetro> as that might ruin a lot of code
[03:09:52] <itatitat> but I havent code, only a library and some parameters in some links
[03:09:53] <Poetro> itatitat: so maybe some code would run twice
[03:09:59] <itatitat> ajam...
[03:10:24] <Poetro> itatitat: which could be bad... like click handlers added twice etc
[03:10:55] <itatitat> I understand
[03:11:15] <itatitat> but the question is, How can I initialize the execution of that library?
[03:11:39] <Poetro> itatitat: maybe look up the library documentation?
[03:11:46] <itatitat> yes of course
[03:12:12] <rethus> mhh, didn't get it to work http://jsfiddle.net/pbFes/8/

[03:31:05] <Ricaz> I basically want to convert datatype smallmoney to int or double.
[03:32:06] <shoky> Ricaz i've used the slider plugin
[03:32:31] <Ricaz> shoky mine is acting really weird, like stepping up when you pull it down sometimes
[03:32:49] <shoky> mine worked fine
[03:32:55] <lcj> shoky - it gives an array and when I expand it I get all kind of functions and things that I am not that interested in - just options elements and attributes
[03:34:09] <shoky> lcj: $('select option').each( function() { console.log( this, this.whatever, $(this).whatever ) } )
[03:35:30] <Ricaz> shoky how did you init it? I have min:0,max:5,step:1,slide: function(){}
[03:36:25] <shoky> i used mostly the defaults
[03:36:31] <shoky> min 0 max 100 step 1
[03:36:54] <shoky> what does your slide function do
[03:39:40] <lcj> thanks shoky - I don't know why Firebug wants to give me the entire tree for each - using chrome it looks ok (also for the first one I had) - I'll go for chrome for now, but if anyone knows how to avoid this in Firebug I'd like to know
[03:43:34] <shoky> ya in chrome is gewd
[03:45:17] <nFFF> lcj why not just use chrome ? :>
[03:47:28] <lcj> nFFF - I'll do that for now - I have just gotten to familiar with Firebug's way of CSS-fiddling - and I don't find chrome as intuitive and smooth (or can I cycle through attributes/values in chrome somehow?)
[03:47:58] <Cork> lcj: firebug expands prototype by default, thats the difference
[03:49:32] <Cork> lcj: so the arrow in the dom tab "Show Own Properties Only"
[03:49:56] <lcj> yeah Cork - but sometimes that is a little overkill - can I add something to console.log that outputs a readable format?
[03:50:53] <Cork> lcj: not nativly no
[03:51:39] <Cork> never seen that as a problem thought
[03:51:54] <lcj> OK - I'll use chrome for that and Firebug for CSS then ;)
[04:01:49] <shoky> or use the line of code i posted and output exactly what u want ;P
[04:03:48] <raj> goodmorning shoky
[04:05:19] <Tasser> is it possible to surround my current DOM element with a <div> (or any other) tag?
[04:06:14] <raj> Tasser, var cnts=$('#yourcurrentelement')
[04:06:45] <raj> and then $('#yourcurrentelement').replace('<div>' + cnts + '</div>')
[04:06:51] <raj> oops, replaceWith
[04:07:04] <Tasser> will that destroy current bindings due to reinsert?
[04:07:55] <Tasser> s/current/currrent jquery/
[04:08:19] <raj> probably
[04:11:58] <varnie> hello
[04:12:05] <Tasser> moving around (via #append) destroy bindings?
[04:12:23] <varnie> is it possible to make href's text invisible while leave its background untouched?
[04:12:39] <varnie> opacity changes both the text and its background.
[04:12:51] <Tasser> varnie, set the text to the background color?
[04:13:07] <varnie> the background is an image
[04:14:38] <Tasser> replace the element with an empty text element of the same size?
[04:15:28] <varnie> smth like $(hrefItem).text('   '); // ?
[04:17:04] <Tasser> beware of variable-sized fonts
[04:17:41] <varnie> I guess it should be "&nbsp;" instead
[04:17:42] <Tasser> I'm not sure if you can call 'width()' on a text element, but try that and replace it with a inlined div (or span) with that set size
[04:18:25] <Tasser> I see a shitload of problems with that workaround...
[04:18:40] <raj> or try .css('width')
[04:18:49] <Tasser> raj, what of likebreaks?
[04:18:52] <Tasser> ehh linebreaks
[04:19:02] <xec_> you can't set width on an inline element
[04:19:27] <shoky> morning raj
[04:19:36] <raj> how can I set a variable that's a bunch of different dom elements?
[04:19:43] <raj> how goes it shoky?
[04:19:45] <xec_> you could try inline-block if you don't care about old versions of IE
[04:19:49] <varnie> yeah;)
[04:19:50] <shoky> raj im gonna one up you ;P
[04:19:56] <shoky> [14:05:20] <Tasser> is it possible to surround my current DOM element with a <div> (or any other) tag?
[04:19:59] <raj> i don't doubt it
[04:19:59] <shoky> ?wrap
[04:20:00] <bot-t> .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[04:20:07] <raj> haha, god damnit
[04:20:09] <shoky> ;D
[04:20:17] <Tasser> shoky, \o/
[04:20:17] <shoky> there's also .unwrap
[04:20:27] <raj> does that maintain bindings?
[04:20:42] <Tasser> does append maintain bindings?
[04:20:48] <shoky> hmm more than .replace i thnk
[04:21:07] <shoky> well
[04:21:19] <shoky> yea i dont see why it shouldnt
[04:21:35] <shoky> raj ok
[04:21:42] <raj> I want $somevar to be =$('#someelement') and $('#someotherelement'). How can I do that?
[04:21:42] <shoky> got an exam in an hour~ :\\
[04:21:51] <raj> ohh, then you need to get off irc

[04:27:30] <shoky> ;)
[04:27:31] <X4n4X> yay
[04:29:31] <Tasser> raj, except looping? I don't think so...
[04:30:35] <raj> weak
[04:30:51] <azk> So, I think my loop is returning  the value before my db query finishes
[04:30:54] <azk> how do
[04:31:03] <shoky> loop?
[04:31:38] <azk> hold on
[04:32:06] <shoky> E_HOLDING_HORSES
[04:32:18] <azk> https://gist.github.com/2470333
[04:32:25] <azk> warning
[04:32:28] <azk> horrible code ahead
[04:32:44] <azk> line 26
[04:32:45] <shoky> loop?
[04:33:11] <azk> there's a for loop in line 18
[04:33:12] <shoky> loop.
[04:33:39] <azk> I need to query for each ssl that pops up
[04:34:08] <azk> and the db.view makes that query, I can see it in chrome console. But the variable is always returned undefined
[04:34:32] <shoky> setTimeout(function() {
[04:34:32] <shoky> 									return data1.rows.value;
[04:34:32] <shoky> 								}, 10000);
[04:34:37] <shoky> wtf?
[04:34:44] <azk> yeah
[04:34:48] <azk> that's something I was trying out
[04:34:56] <azk> le derp
[04:35:00] <azk> disregard that
[04:35:14] <shoky> trying to return a value from the outer function? :)
[04:35:25] <kborchers> raj: is this what you meant by adding a column to a table? http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/BjxuP/
[04:35:26] <shoky> nice try ;P
[04:35:56] <raj> kborchers, yes, but a bit more complicated
[04:36:23] <raj> I need to define a column and set it equal to a variable
[04:36:26] <azk> shoky: what do you mean?
[04:36:31] <shoky> azk. nvm
[04:36:45] <shoky> azk, so it seems the db request is asynchronoous..
[04:36:47] <azk> I edited it for clarity btw
[04:36:48] <raj> then later I need to do $('#mytable').append(mypreviouscolumnvar)
[04:36:54] <shoky> so obviously, the loop will keep going
[04:37:03] <raj> not sure how to tackle this one
[04:37:06] <shoky> regardless of how long it takes to query the db
[04:37:15] <shoky> not that i know anything about querying dbs from js
[04:37:25] <azk> ok
[04:38:04] <raj> kborchers, any ideas?
[04:38:42] <azk> Hmm
[04:38:48] <azk> I'll try adding async: false to both
[04:38:55] <shoky> that's a big ew
[04:39:04] <shoky> ?async @ azk
[04:39:04] <bot-t> azk, NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[04:39:05] <azk> I know it is
[04:39:33] <c0d3rg1rl> why does this work in FFox and not IE with 1.7.2? http://jsfiddle.net/K9y7Z/ - seems like a bug in jquerys document.createElement code
[04:39:35] <azk> I just wanted to see if that would make it better
[04:39:38] <azk> apparently it doesn't
[04:39:41] <shoky> heh
[04:39:42] <c0d3rg1rl> IE7
[04:40:05] <c0d3rg1rl> in FFox the <content123> is created and can be used, in IE7 not
[04:41:04] <c0d3rg1rl> another small problem is the style="" which is not used in IE7
[04:48:37] <bean77> I have a string which is valid (checked by jsonlint) json and want to get the json object -> $.parseJSON(data) works in all browsers except IE (v7) which claims that the data is invalid ... there is nothing documented about this in the jQuery API ?
[04:48:42] <shoky> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/BjxuP/2/
[04:48:46] <soee> hi, i have code like this: <ul id="T"><li class="A"><span class="X"></span></li><li class="B"></li></ul> now how can i check if ul#T has child with class B and if so do some action with span in child with class A ?
[04:49:19] <raj> shoky, exactly what I did :)
[04:49:25] <raj> thank you though
[04:49:25] <shoky> ;D
[04:50:09] <itatitat> ey guys
[04:50:20] <itatitat> after to use load to load a new content in my page
[04:50:36] <quicksilver> soee: $('#T').has('.B').find('.A span').html("boo")
[04:50:40] <itatitat> I execute a selector
[04:50:54] <itatitat> but the problem is that selector not select anything of the new content
[04:50:59] <itatitat> only from the old content
[04:51:16] <shoky> did you add the new content to the DOM ?
[04:51:20] <itatitat> javascript doesnt know tanything about the new DOM
[04:51:23] <itatitat> yes
[04:51:34] <itatitat> how can I select something of the new content?
[04:51:35] <shoky> then any selector you run after adding it should find it
[04:51:58] <itatitat> jummmmmmm...yes....I thought that...
[04:52:00] <itatitat> ok
[04:52:03] <itatitat> im goint to try
[04:52:04] <itatitat> again
[04:53:01] <c0d3rg1rl> What's the difference between jquery element creation and document.createElement? If I create the element in native JS, it works fine in IE, if I create it with jquery, it fails, updated example with native code: http://jsfiddle.net/K9y7Z/1/
[04:53:16] <Zhy> itatitat, I had the same issue, I used the selector in a ajaxComplete call ... like this : $(document).ajaxComplete(function(){ /* whatever you wanna do */ });
[04:53:30] <itatitat> ajaxComplete...
[04:53:36] <itatitat> aaaaaaaaaah
[04:53:36] <Zhy> but on a side note - how would one add the newly loaded content to the DOM ? I though that would happen automatically
[04:53:42] <itatitat> ok, the complet called to axax
[04:53:44] <itatitat> ajax
[04:53:54] <itatitat> ajam
[04:54:41] <Zhy> :)
[04:54:46] <ablomen> c0d3rg1rl, $('<content123 id="content123" should be $('<div id="....
[04:55:31] <c0d3rg1rl> ablomen: no, I want a <content123> tag
[04:55:47] <ablomen> c0d3rg1rl, that does not work in older ie's
[04:56:15] <c0d3rg1rl> ablomen: it works fine in native JS, look at my example
[04:56:23] <itatitat> but the problem is I'm using Load
[04:56:25] <c0d3rg1rl> it does not work with jquery though
[04:56:34] <bean77> is it necessary to escape some stuff for IE but not in other browsers - which is not made by jQuery? (my json is like: {"graph":"<ul id=\"myId\">someHTML..."} )
[04:57:43] <quicksilver> c0d3rg1rl: completely non-standard elements like <content123> are not officially supported by any browser in HTML documents.
[04:58:04] <quicksilver> c0d3rg1rl: I would really recommend against working with them; you'll have to do all your own careful testing and evaluating of how each engine behaves
[04:58:11] <quicksilver> and it varies by doctype and quirks mode.
[04:58:27] <itatitat> guys I cant find new elements in DOM after to use load()
[04:58:30] <Zhy> itatitat, I'm using load, too, and in conjunction with ajaxComplete it works fine
[04:58:31] <soee> quicksilver, ok i tested it but i desrcibed it wrong
[04:58:37] <itatitat> ok
[04:58:41] <itatitat> I'll study that option
[04:58:49] <quicksilver> c0d3rg1rl: (you can use them in XML, though for those browsers which support XML documents)
[04:58:55] <Zhy>     $("#sideRegisterContent").load("/"+controllerName+"/add div.sideRegWrap");
[04:58:55] <Zhy>  that's what is loaded on button click and then I have:
[04:59:20] <soee> quicksilver,  <ul id="T"><li class="A"><span class="X"></span></li><li class="B"></li></ul> - action on span X sould be done only if next element after li.A is li.B
[04:59:22] <Zhy> $(document).ajaxComplete(function(){     $('.entryDetailOptionButton').button();});
[04:59:27] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: it depends on how complex the string you provide is
[04:59:34] <Zhy> I don't know whether that's the usual way it's done, but it works for me :)
[04:59:46] <itatitat> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[04:59:47] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: if you give it a simple tag it just runs createElement
[04:59:49] <c0d3rg1rl> quicksilver: The other <contentXXX> elements are created via XML, but I have to add some more manually later. That's when I run into the problem.
[04:59:54] <itatitat> I was watching, yes yes, look fine
[05:00:02] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: if not it uses a createDocumentFragment solution
[05:00:19] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: so the style/id are the problem?
[05:00:44] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: it has to match /^<(\w+)\s*\/?>(?:<\/\1>)?$/
[05:00:59] <Cork> else it uses the buildFragment function
[05:01:56] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: so if you give any attributes inline it becomes a fragment
[05:02:10] <Cork> why that fails in ie is another matter
[05:02:27] <Cork> i use that a lot and it works fine in ie > 5.5 at least
[05:02:51] <Cork> so it looks like its something special in your fragment that fails
[05:03:20] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: thats a good explaination, this works in IE: $('<content789 />').attr('id', 'content789').appendTo('#elem');
[05:03:46] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: Thanks a lot
[05:03:54] <c0d3rg1rl> quicksilver: Also thanks a lot
[05:04:04] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: just guessing, but ie needs you to create an unknown element before its confy with it
[05:04:13] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: that might be what hits you
[05:04:34] <smykes> I need to pick some brains.  I have an advanced search menu that slides out of a search box at the top of the page.  The advanced searc hides when the cursor is out of it for half a second.  The issue is that the browser things that being in a <select> inside of the advanced search is out side of it so it disapears.  Thoughts?
[05:04:54] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: so document.createEleemnt('content789'); somewhere before you try to create the fragment might be all thats needed
[05:05:01] <Cork> *Element
[05:05:04] <Tasser> can I bind dom inserts?
[05:05:15] <Cork> Tasser: not cross browsers
[05:05:32] <NodeX> livequery will do it
[05:05:35] <Tasser> Cork, how much corss browser?
[05:05:56] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: thanks, If I do it like this it works: http://jsfiddle.net/K9y7Z/2/
[05:05:59] <Cork> Tasser: only works in farly new versions of webkit and gecko
[05:06:19] <Cork> opera and ie is out of the question
[05:07:05] <Tasser> Cork, should do
[05:07:20] <Cork> NodeX: livequery does it through a constant going timer, and thats waistfull to the xstream
[05:07:31] <itatitat> OK is working with ajaxComplete
[05:07:43] <Cork> ?mdc DOMSubtreeModified @ Tasser
[05:07:52] <bot-t> Tasser, DOM event reference - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/DOM_event_reference
[05:08:08] <Zhy> itatitat: great, I have been searching for that for quite some time myself and was relieved when I found it ^^
[05:08:25] <Tasser> Cork, deprecated?
[05:08:31] <koichirose> Hello everyone! I successfully added the new JS FileAPI to my file input so I can preview images before uploading them. I'd like to do the same with file inputs with 'multiple' attribute, but jquery is returning only one selected file. Anyone knows how to get them all?
[05:08:32] <itatitat> jajajaja, fuck!!!!, yes!, sometimes i desesperate with javascript
[05:08:35] <smykes> anyone know of a snippet of code that will fire into the console every time the cursor moves into another element?
[05:08:47] <Zhy> smykes: It's got something to do with event bubbling and capturing, best you look those two things up, I had the same problem but unfortunately I had to focus on other things f irst so I don't have a definite solution for you
[05:08:47] <itatitat> really sometimes is wonderfull, but when the Dom change, and all those problems....i desesperate
[05:09:02] <itatitat> thanks for your time
[05:09:03] <itatitat> thanks a lot
[05:09:12] <smykes> Zhy Thank you, that is certainly something to go by
[05:09:18] <Zhy> not a problem :) glad I could help
[05:09:29] <Tasser> Cork, oke, looks like it sucks.
[05:09:36] <kborchers> smykes: look into mouseenter/mouseleave instead of mouseover/mouseout
[05:09:42] <Cork> Tasser: ya, its costly cause it causes events for every time the dom is changed
[05:09:49] <smykes> Zhy you didn't yell FIDDLE, so right away thats something
[05:09:59] <NodeX> it's only costly if you make it costly
[05:10:02] <smykes> kborchers already using mouseleave and mouseenter
[05:10:19] <Cork> Tasser: mutation listner is on its way, with a less event like approch, though its support is even worse
[05:11:12] <Cork> Tasser: http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#mutationobserver
[05:12:26] <Zhy> smykes: yeah, that's because I knew EXACTLY what you meant, having run into the same problem :D kindly let me know your findings, as I said I might still need a solution for that myself :)
[05:12:29] <Tasser> Cork, nah, I'll try to hook stuff somewhere else
[05:12:40] <Cork> Tasser: thats the best solution ya
[05:13:03] <smykes> Zhy I wouldn't need a solution if QA hadn't found the bug ;)
[05:13:17] <smykes> Zhy I am using chosen, so in anything other than IE7 or IE 8 it works fine
[05:14:47] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: FYI: a document.createElement('content789'); and then $('<content789 id="content789" />') does not help. I have to use $('<content789 />').attr({ ... }) - then all works fine.
[05:14:48] <Zhy> ah ok , thanks , I will look into that :)
[05:14:54] <smykes> Zhy I am using bind I wonder if i switch to on if it will work
[05:15:14] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: interesting
[05:15:39] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: yes. so I actually consider it as some form of bug, not sure if in IE or jquery
[05:16:02] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: sounds like a compatibility bug in jquery
[05:16:08] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: yes.
[05:16:18] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: if its a bug or lack of implementation in ie is irelevant
[05:16:25] <smykes> kborchers are you of the same opinnion?  bubbling?
[05:16:40] <Cork> jquery should handle it, its the point of it after all
[05:16:56] <Zhy> smykes: humm ... dunno ^^ wouldn't take too much time to try, would it?
[05:17:07] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: so I found a jquery bug?
[05:17:22] <kborchers> smykes: yes, somewhere your event is bubbling to a point where it gets handled when you don't want it to but without seeing what you're doing it's hard to tell what's going on
[05:17:27] <smykes> Zhy sorry I'm a talker out louder
[05:17:44] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: i think so, it might already be known though
[05:17:51] <Cork> check the bug tracker
[05:17:53] <smykes> kborchers if i work up a jsfiddle will you take a look?
[05:18:00] <Zhy> smykes: I don't mind you sharing your thoughts, worst thing that could happen is that you mention something that might help others
[05:18:27] <kborchers> smykes: sure ... i'm at work but i can give it a quick look
[05:19:03] <smykes> thanks kborchers probably take me 20-30 minutes to work something up
[05:22:07] <friendly123386> hi all anyone around does mobile app design and development i have few quetsions
[05:25:13] <Xotix> is it possible that animate is  a lot slower than hide(slide) etc?
[05:25:32] <Cork> no, hide uses animate inside
[05:26:23] <Cork> hide: function() { return this.animate( genFx("hide", 3), speed, easing, callback); }
[05:26:27] <Cork> (simplified)
[05:27:01] <bean77> or is it necessary to use a external javascript parser for json ?
[05:27:34] <Cork> bean77: if you get your json over ajax, jquery has built in parser
[05:28:08] <Cork> just make sure the mimetype is correct
[05:28:38] <raj> shoky, good luck
[05:28:48] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: can't find a related bug in tracker. I wrote a complete test-case here: http://jsfiddle.net/fuNth/ - Can you post a bug, I do not have an account on the tracker and am not familiar with the tracker-rules etc.
[05:29:17] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: file one your self, its always best if the one that found it is the one reporting it
[05:29:26] <Cork> it makes it easier if the developers has folloup questions
[05:30:44] <bean77> Cork: I use the ajaxSubmit() from jQuery-Form Plugin
[05:31:13] <bean77> where I get back a string (which is the json)
[05:31:32] <Cork> ?.parseJSON
[05:31:32] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[05:31:46] <bean77> than I call $.parseJSON(data) which works in all browsers except IE
[05:31:59] <Cork> O_o
[05:32:06] * Cork checks what parseJSON does
[05:32:17] <Cork> i expected it to have a workaround for ie, else its pointless
[05:32:53] <bean77> I think so too but have no clue what to do in IE
[05:32:58] <Cork> bean77: parseJSON should work in it
[05:33:00] <Cork> *ie
[05:33:12] <Cork> return ( new Function( "return " + data ) )(); <-- for ie
[05:33:17] <aro> how can i make text glow once and return back to its normal state?
[05:33:34] <jcp_> anyone know how i can make this sidebar stop before it hits the footer? http://jsfiddle.net/9QRER/2/
[05:33:34] <Cork> aro: animate and callback?
[05:33:34] <chilversc_> bean77: simple way is to use JSON2.js so that browsers without native support get a window.JSON object
[05:34:14] <friendly123386> anyone design apps or is this just web based development
[05:34:21] <aro> yeah but what property do i use to make it 'glow'
[05:34:59] <Bubbi> Anybody that can tell me which event to hook up on to get the width of an element while using jQuery Mobile? I've tried with pageinit, as it is the recommended event, like the ready-event in normal jQuery. If I use pageinit, i get '0px', as if the element is hidden..
[05:34:59] <Cork> text-shadow
[05:35:05] <aro> can jquery animate text-shadow?
[05:35:14] <Cork> only works in browsers that supports it thought
[05:35:48] <Cork> ?.textShadow
[05:35:50] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".textShadow" in jQuery Docs.
[05:35:58] <Cork> ?g jquery.textShadow
[05:35:59] <bot-t> Cork, Text Shadow | jQuery Plugins - Plugins - jQuery - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/textshadow
[05:36:34] <Bubbi> friendly123386: Can only talk for myself, but I only use jQuery for normal web based development, but if you are looking for a way to use jQuery with a phone App, then PhoneGap could be a framework to look at?
[05:37:30] <ablomen> bean77, jQuery implements a fallback for ie's lower then 8, so you'r problem lies somewhere else, are you sure it's valid json?
[05:38:34] <ablomen> (test the json string in jsonlint.com)
[05:38:36] <friendly123386> well i have a app in development and its almost complete, its done in phonegap and thats not my issue,  as im not a coder or developer i was wondering how hard it would be to change the design of my app once completed.or if it was better to have fixed now.
[05:40:26] <bean77> ablomen: yes i think so jsonlint does say YES
[05:40:59] <ablomen> ok, then it's somewhere else in your code, can you show us the code that handles the data?
[05:41:18] <bean77> I will prepare a example one moment
[05:41:56] <Bubbi> friendly123386: If you use phonegap, then it should be as easy as changing design on a website. It all depends on how good the application was thought through at the development phase. If you are lucky, it could take 1-3 hours, but if wasn't very well developed, then you could be looking at 20+ hours of recoding to change the design. It really depends on the development phase
[05:42:00] <smykes> zhy you still around?
[05:42:21] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: have filed a ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11620 - feel free to add info about createDocumentFragment etc. Thanks.
[05:43:28] <Cork> c0d3rg1rl: don't think i have much to add
[05:43:59] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: I hope I got the right "technical" wording, my first bug-report ever
[05:44:11] <Cork> sounds fine to me
[05:44:54] <smykes> Cork any idea why hideSearchPanel() can't be found?  http://jsfiddle.net/T6z2j/2/
[05:45:13] <smykes> I seem to be having a monday morning
[05:46:05] <Cork> smykes: your using a string in setTimeout
[05:46:07] <smykes> that should be http://jsfiddle.net/T6z2j/6/
[05:46:18] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/T6z2j/7/
[05:46:28] <Zhy> smykes: yeah sorry, I'm here ... gotta read what you wrote
[05:46:52] <Cork> smykes: never ever EVER use strings in setTimeout/setInterval
[05:47:00] <smykes> huh someone told me too
[05:47:02] <smykes> strange
[05:47:33] <Cork> if your using strings they'r always refered to in the global scope cause strings dosen't have a scope
[05:47:55] <bean77> ablomen: http://pastebin.com/z62yctQk
[05:48:37] <smykes> ok kborchers in IE 8 or IE 7 http://jsfiddle.net/T6z2j/10/  try selecting something at the bottom of the select
[05:49:13] <smykes> thanks Cork
[05:49:22] <Cork> np
[05:53:11] <ablomen> bean77, ok i tried parsing it with the fallback function, the problem is the escaped quotes
[05:53:50] <bean77> so what would be the IE specific workaround?
[05:53:56] <ablomen> bean77, they need to be escaped twice, so it ends up as '{    "success": "true",    "graph": "<p id=\\"myID\\">test</p>" }'
[05:54:15] <Zhy> smykes: I cannot check the behaviour for IE btu on chrome, the div hides (or slides up again) when I have t he select box open but my mouse is over ... white space.. is that how it should be or should it not hide at all when the select box is open?
[05:54:27] <bean77> can I do that wich .replace(xyz) ?
[05:54:59] <Cork> you don't need to dubble escape untess you give the json in a javascript inline string
[05:55:33] <Bubbi> say Aye, if you have used jQuery Mobile
[05:56:53] <NodeX> nay
[05:56:53] <bean77> Cork: do you mean $.parseJSON("'"+data+"'")
[05:57:13] <Cork> bean77: no
[05:57:53] <Cork> if you send json over ajax { "key":"<elm id=\"value\"></elm>" } is what you want
[05:58:08] <Cork> if its an inline string in the script it needs to be escaped for the string key
[05:58:21] <Cork> var data = "{ "key":"<elm id=\\"value\\"></elm>" }";
[05:58:32] <ablomen> Cork, bean77 >> see http://jsfiddle.net/KsXwg/
[05:58:46] <Cork> the extra \ is for the wrapping string quotes
[05:59:03] <ablomen> that's the function that jquery uses (with the native implementation stripped out
[05:59:23] <Bubbi> God damm.. I mean Allah Dammit it :-)
[05:59:52] <nascro> Hey folks, good morning from Illinois. Can someone offer me some feedback on why multiple divs are showing up in the container below the photos when multiple photos are hovered quickly? http://bit.ly/JZHeNR
[06:00:53] <smykes> http://jsfiddle.net/T6z2j/10/ kborchers not sure if you saw it the first time sorry (anyone welcome to look) IE7/8 unable to select from the bottom of the dropdown
[06:02:24] <Cork> ablomen, bean77: http://jsfiddle.net/KsXwg/2/
[06:04:52] <Zhy> smykes:  I cannot check the behaviour for IE btu on chrome, the div hides (or slides up again) when I have t he select box open but my mouse is over ... white space.. is that how it should be or should it not hide at all when the select box is open?
[06:05:07] <kborchers> smykes: this is definitely not perfect but should get you on your way. sorry i can't dive in much more http://jsfiddle.net/T6z2j/13/
[06:05:16] <shwaiil> Q: Having a container with z-index 2, and a element in its back z-index 1, how could I make one nested element of the last, be clickable if container is in top ? The nested element on the back is visible! Thanks for looking
[06:05:21] <varnie> suppose I wrapped inner myElement; how would I unwrap it from that element in the end?
[06:05:44] <varnie> e.g, I did "$this.wrapInner($('<span style="display:none;"/>'));" and later I want to unwrap it back.
[06:06:12] <smykes> thanks kborchers
[06:06:21] <smykes> Zhy that is not good behavior :/
[06:06:25] <Cork> varnie: normally you should just leave the elements you need in the html
[06:06:55] <Cork> varnie: but you can take the children of the wrapper element and append it to the original parent
[06:07:23] <shwaiil> or if it's possible to change the index of nested element, or set it to a diferent parent trough js or something like that :T
[06:07:36] <Zhy> smykes: check kborchers solution whether it suits your needs, I would have advised something like that
[06:07:54] <smykes> overSelect = !overSelect;this line just makes overSelect the opposite of what it was?
[06:08:24] <kborchers> smykes: yeah
[06:08:41] <smykes> i also didn;t know you could chain variables like that
[06:08:45] <Zhy> smykes: you toggle the variable so while the select box is focused, the div cannot be hidden
[06:08:46] <bean77> ablomen: I inserted your pjson function and called pjson(data) which also leads into INVALID JSON or was this not what you intended to do with this?
[06:09:26] <smykes> zhy yeah that part i got i just didn;t know you could do that
[06:10:01] <nascro> Regarding my first comment, is there some sort of timer element to the fadeIn/fadeOut method that needs to finish before another one begins?
[06:10:35] <Zhy> smykes: I must admit I didn't know that either :D
[06:10:43] <nascro> @kborchers do you still live in Chicagoland or did you move for the new gig?
[06:14:01] <smykes> Zhy yeah this is going to be tricky :.
[06:14:03] <smykes> :/
[06:14:03] <ablomen> bean77, no it was an example, but what Cork showed, it should work, it seems your ajaxSubmit plugin thingy screws something up
[06:14:20] <ablomen> s/what/as
[06:14:31] <coppa> if anyone interested : iScroll with easy pullUp/down to refresh, lazyload and polite scroll : https://github.com/binarymind/xscroll
[06:14:51] <ablomen> you might have to tell it you are getting json, not html or other content
[06:15:03] <kborchers> nascro: still in Naperville ... working from home :)
[06:15:21] <smykes> kborchers small world my GF is from Naperville
[06:15:45] <kborchers> smykes: small indeed :)
[06:16:06] <smykes> she of course has seen the light and moved to Boston ;)
[06:16:11] <nascro> @kborchers Excellent :)
[06:16:46] <bean77> ablomen: so I have to replace all the thinks like " to &quot; and so on ?
[06:17:15] <Cork> bean77: no
[06:17:27] <Cork> check whats shown in the textarea in to the right
[06:17:40] <Cork> s/in/to/
[06:18:04] <kborchers> smykes: heh, i do like Boston ... i know some awesome JS folks in Boston that work at Bocoup
[06:18:46] <coppa> I'm shipping up to boston \o/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-64CaD8GXw
[06:18:46] <bean77> Cork: but thats exactly whats in my data variable
[06:19:07] <Cork> bean77: make sure thats what you actaully get in your js variable
[06:19:11] <smykes> kborchers erich is here
[06:19:39] <MikeH> How can I set the value of a select? Is there a nicer way than looping through the option's and checking if the value is equal to what I want?
[06:20:33] <smykes> MikeH $("foo").val("bar");
[06:21:46] <smykes> MikeH or more like $("select.foo").val("bar");
[06:23:39] <kborchers> smykes: why don't you have him fix your mouseenter issue? ;)
[06:23:54] <smykes> he isn;t in here right now ;)
[06:27:45] <raj> I've got an array with some strings defining dom elements. myarray=['<td></td>','<td><canvas></canvas></td>','<td><td>']. I'd like to select the canvas element being created, and make a jquery object out of it. console.log( $(myarray[1]).find('canvas')) is just giving me [<canvas>]
[06:27:56] <phryk> can i somehow perform an action on all *but* the first item of a selection?
[06:27:59] <raj> but it isn't a jquery object
[06:28:25] <smykes> Zhy I think I have a solution
[06:28:26] <raj> ?not @phryk
[06:28:26] <bot-t> phryk, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[06:28:43] <smykes> Zhy http://jsfiddle.net/T6z2j/21/
[06:28:55] <Zhy> smykes: thanks, I'll look into it
[06:28:55] <phryk> raj: Thanks, that seems to be exactly what I want :)
[06:29:00] <smykes> Zhy shit
[06:29:03] <Zhy> xD
[06:29:05] <Zhy> not?
[06:29:05] <smykes> i just realized im in firefox
[06:29:07] <raj> np
[06:29:10] <Zhy> dang
[06:29:10] <smykes> lol
[06:29:17] <Zhy> browser jet lag =/
[06:29:54] <jcp_> anyone know how to make the "scroll" sidebar stop before it hits the footer div? http://jsfiddle.net/9QRER/2/
[06:30:17] <Zhy> I thought kborchers's solution would work with IE, it does not ?
[06:30:37] <smykes> trying
[06:30:50] <smykes> yeah it does
[06:30:58] <smykes> but you have to click again for it to hide
[06:31:24] <smykes> or go in then go out
[06:31:38] <smykes> it seems blur doesnt fire until you click somewhere outside of the select
[06:31:40] <smykes> i tried change
[06:31:43] <smykes> but that didnt work
[06:31:55] <Zhy> Oh .. I see.. if I click a 1 that is above the div, it hides, if I click one of the last few, it doesn't
[06:34:39] <anli_> Strange, when I hide and show a div, some elements becomes selected
[06:34:44] <anli_> Or how to express it
[06:34:49] <anli_> Marked up
[06:35:23] <polishedguy94> Hello
[06:35:24] <smykes> how do you get the html in full screen again in jsfiddle?
[06:36:03] <polishedguy94> How  to make an ajax which posts data to server and fetches response of the server?
[06:36:35] <bluepnume> Hi -- is there a way to select all input elements with no value?
[06:36:54] <bean77> Cork: iam really sorry but this seems to be exactly whats in my variable ...
[06:37:14] <polishedguy94> I have tried $.post and a success callback where I make $.get to the '/' but obviously it load whole original page not a little piece of information which servers sends
[06:37:39] <anli_> Maybe the handler needs to return false
[06:37:47] <anli_> If its a response of a button click
[06:37:57] <Cork> bean77: then it should work
[06:38:10] <raj> Mr. Cork, any thoughts for me?
[06:38:12] <raj> :)
[06:38:12] <Cork> bean77: can't say anything more then that without seeing the code
[06:38:16] <Cork> heh
[06:38:22] <Cork> raj: whats the question?
[06:38:44] <raj> I've got an array with some strings defining dom elements. myarray=['<td></td>','<td><canvas></canvas></td>','<td><td>']. I'd like to select the canvas element being created, and make a jquery object out of it. console.log( $(myarray[1]).find('canvas')) is just giving me [<canvas>] without a collapsible dropdown (the way jquery objects have)
[06:40:11] <Cork> raj: [<canvas>] is what a jquery selection normally looks like
[06:40:22] <Cork> (in object inspection)
[06:40:43] <raj> Cork, what about all the properties associated with a jquery object?
[06:40:52] <raj> that show up with that collasible dropdown
[06:40:56] <Cork> they'r on the prototype
[06:41:23] <Cork> raj: what are you looking for?
[06:41:38] <Cork> the dom?
[06:42:21] <raj> Cork, oh, I'm mistaken
[06:42:22] <polishedguy94> I want my script to post some data and then fetch the response from the server but my script doesn't work, link: https://raw.github.com/rozsmiechanykapelutek/Shortenize/master/public/javascripts/alias.js
[06:42:27] <raj> that's when there's additional children
[06:42:35] <Cork> ah
[06:42:39] <raj> sorry about tha
[06:42:42] <raj> t
[06:43:20] <Cork> polishedguy94: the response comes in the success callback
[06:43:26] <Cork> no need for the extra get call
[06:45:11] <polishedguy94> Cork: then how do I refer tro the response data?
[06:45:30] <Cork> success: function(data) {}
[06:45:38] <polishedguy94> thanks a lot
[06:45:47] <Cork> polishedguy94: your responding to the request from the client
[06:46:02] <Cork> else it would be a request with no response, followed by a new request with the response
[06:46:20] <Cork> and then you would have to have something to connect the two calls
[06:46:40] <itatitat> ey guys
[06:46:58] <itatitat> i need to discover which element is the origin of an event
[06:47:03] <itatitat> but the problem, for exemplo
[06:47:08] <itatitat> example
[06:47:22] <itatitat> y I do $(this).attr('name')
[06:47:27] <itatitat> is that the result is "undefinied"
[06:49:17] <polishedguy94> Cork: Works like a charm! Insane!
[06:53:46] <timkuijsten> how can i add extra attributes to the datepicker on extra initialization? i'd like to add "data-bypass" to all <a> of the datepicker..
[06:53:58] <timkuijsten> s/extra//
[06:57:00] <itatitat> why if I do this I get only an error
[06:57:01] <itatitat> event.target.closests('a')
[06:57:09] <itatitat> is not fine?????.......i dont know
[06:57:32] <itatitat> I always receive the same error. event.target.closests is not a function
[06:57:38] <itatitat> but it is a function
[06:57:44] <rworth> $(events.target).closest('a')
[06:57:49] <itatitat> ouch!
[06:57:52] <itatitat> that hurt me
[06:58:46] <xec_> yeah, rworth, stop hurting people! -.-
[06:59:19] <rworth>  /o\
[07:06:05] <raj> Cork, I'd like to drawImage onto that canvas from the list. Can I do that?
[07:06:14] <raj> even though its just a list of strings
[07:06:35] <christo_m> hi, im doing a .each over a bunch of key value pairs , the keys happen to be mysql timestamps
[07:06:41] <christo_m> is there a way to look ahead to the next key?
[07:07:55] <raj> christo_m, it's not ordered, cuz it's an object, so I don't think there's a concept of next
[07:08:09] <raj> afaik
[07:09:00] <christo_m> raj: well, im trying to compare the current timestamp, with the one ahead.
[07:09:05] <Slydder> hey all. I am trying to get the the checkboxes in a checkbox array that are checked and it just isn't working for me. I have tried varying forms of: $j("input[name='csn_user_categories[]':checked").each
[07:09:05] <christo_m> you're saying theres no way to do this?
[07:09:23] <Slydder> and nothing seems to work.
[07:09:39] <christo_m> raj: just so you know im dealing with a select box.. so if theres another iteration method i can use, let me know
[07:09:41] <raj> Slydder, you haven't closed your input
[07:09:55] <Slydder> raj: that's just the beginning of the block
[07:10:09] <raj> Slydder, maybe put the keys all in a sorted array
[07:10:16] <Slydder> that is not working. until that is working the rest of the block is unimportant
[07:11:08] <raj> Slydder, you are missing a ]
[07:11:12] <Slydder> there is a way to access the checked attr/prop (which I have tried variants of) and I just can't get it working in this instance
[07:11:36] <Slydder> raj. yes I am.
[07:11:38] <Slydder> I thank you
[07:12:21] <Slydder> raj. works like a charm. thanks a lot
[07:12:58] <shwaiil> Q: Let's say I've done var el = $('#myEl'); and I have a bind like: el.hover(); I'd like to know, how could I add more elements to this hover action ? for example, if I didnt associated $('#myEl') to var el, I could $('#myEl, .otherElements'). Not sure if clear, but any help is appreciated thanks!
[07:13:12] <christo_m> raj: apparently i can use some 'eq' sorcery
[07:13:19] <raj> shwaiil, I tihnk so
[07:13:21] <raj> *think
[07:13:52] <smykes> Zhy I can;t think of anything
[07:14:27] <itatitat> jummmmmmmmm very strange guys
[07:14:39] <christo_m> raj: okay heres a thing, ive parsed the options into a json array instead
[07:14:41] <itatitat> I'm trying to discover in which link I made click
[07:14:43] <christo_m> and its available in my view
[07:14:44] <itatitat> with event.target
[07:14:46] <itatitat> work fine
[07:14:58] <christo_m> raj:  is there a way now to iterate over this json array and compare i++ with i, i being current index?
[07:15:10] <raj> yep
[07:15:13] <raj> i+1
[07:15:14] <itatitat> but the second time I make click in another link, he tells me that I made click in the shame link that before
[07:15:22] <christo_m> raj: using what kind of loop?
[07:15:22] <JA|2> itatitat use django
[07:15:33] <itatitat> XD
[07:15:33] <raj> put ur code in jsfiddle, and I can tell you better
[07:15:36] <smykes> i wish normal <select>s had a callback when they closed
[07:15:37] <itatitat> ok
[07:15:40] <christo_m> my codes bad
[07:16:44] <Zhy> smykes: sorry was occupied with some other things... I'll let you know should I have an idea concerning the select thingy... will be back here in about 45 minutes
[07:17:01] <smykes> Zhy thanks would appreciate it
[07:17:07] <christo_m> raj: i cant exactly do i+1 because the indexes arent ints
[07:17:21] <raj> you said it's in a json array
[07:17:42] <christo_m> raj:  yes
[07:17:50] <christo_m> its like {mysqlstamp : military time, }
[07:17:50] <raj> array's have integer indexes
[07:17:58] <raj> that's a json object
[07:18:07] <raj> you haven't accomplished anything by doing that
[07:18:14] <christo_m> okay well
[07:18:16] <raj> and btw, that's incorrectly formatted for a json object
[07:18:17] <christo_m> thats the format its in
[07:18:34] <christo_m> Object { 2012-04-05 15:30:00="3:30:00", 2012-04-05 15:35:00="3:35:00", 2012-04-05 16:05:00="4:05:00", more...}
[07:18:43] <raj> keys need " "
[07:18:53] <raj> anyway, make an array of the keys, and then sort that array
[07:19:07] <raj> and then use that array to get whatever next key you want
[07:19:10] <christo_m> the keys are sorted already.
[07:19:22] <christo_m> raj: okay, just so you know what im doing
[07:19:49] <christo_m> raj: im trying to dynamically change a box for a booking interval, so i select a time to start, and then update the interval im allowed, by the next stamp that isnt booked
[07:20:00] <christo_m> so as you can see, 3 30 to 3 35 is okay, but 3 35 to 4 05 is booked
[07:20:13] <christo_m> because timestamps should be apart by some interval, in this case , 5
[07:20:24] <christo_m> if they arent apart by 5, then i must have a booking, and i should make the interval 0,
[07:20:32] <christo_m> so i want to check the next timestamp ahead
[07:20:39] <christo_m> and see the difference is interval, from the current timestamp
[07:25:42] <raj> christo_m, what I suggested would be how I'd handle it
[07:26:21] <itatitat> ey guys
[07:26:24] <itatitat> I've a problem
[07:26:32] <itatitat> just now I added a new content to my web page
[07:26:35] <itatitat> with ajax
[07:26:57] <itatitat> mmmmmmmmmm, in resumen
[07:27:01] <smykes> is there a way to tell what element the cursor is currently in?
[07:27:14] <xmaddness> yeah
[07:27:21] <xmaddness> 1 sec
[07:27:35] <itatitat> after to add a new content with ajax, if I make click in a new element I obtain always with event.target that I made click in the last link, not the recent link
[07:27:38] <xmaddness> document.activeElement
[07:28:16] <itatitat> ooooooooooooooh
[07:28:17] <itatitat> nono
[07:28:22] <itatitat> I know............
[07:28:27] <itatitat> I belive is closest
[07:28:29] <itatitat> the function....
[07:28:34] <itatitat> maybe is that
[07:28:35] <smykes> that returns an object xmaddness
[07:28:45] <itatitat> javascript is giving me another thing
[07:28:47] <Jon30> In my html I have something like this: <li style="margin-left:20; z-index:5">Test1 </li>. I want to be able to get this object based on its z-index value. So something like this:  $('li[style="*zindex=5*"]') ...this doesn't work though, I am looking for the right syntax
[07:29:16] <JA|2> itatitat: atb
[07:29:22] <itatitat> telme
[07:29:25] <itatitat> tell me
[07:34:48] <raj> I've got an array with some strings defining dom elements. var myarray=['<td></td>','<td><canvas></canvas></td>','<td><td>']. I've selected the canvas element being created with var mycanvas=$(myarray[1]).find('canvas'). And I'm then doing a drawImage into that canvas. But how can I place this new and improved canvas element back into the original myarray?
[07:35:34] <Jon47> myarray[1] = mycanvas.text() ?
[07:36:29] <raj> Jon47, really?
[07:36:38] <raj> it's not text, though, for one
[07:37:14] <Jon47> raj what do you want to add to your array exactly?
[07:37:24] <Jon47> the dom element?
[07:37:31] <raj> yep
[07:37:38] <xmaddness> Does anyone know of a canvas channel/
[07:37:40] <Jon47> myarray[1] = mycanvas[0]
[07:37:43] <Poetro> raj: just myarray[1].appendTo(document.body)
[07:37:58] <raj> xmaddness, #canvas
[07:38:07] <k1t> hey hey folks good mornign
[07:38:09] <k1t> morning*
[07:38:14] <raj> Jon47, that'll be the canvas with the drawn image?
[07:38:24] <xmaddness> raj doesn't exist
[07:38:39] <raj> xmaddness, sorry, ##canvas
[07:39:05] <k1t> any reputable ninjas up for contract?
[07:39:10] <Jon47> that will be the dom element, i hoenstly don't know much about how the canvas is represented
[07:39:22] <cortexman> is it me or is chrome's inspector semi retarded?
[07:39:28] <k1t> excuse me if this is the wrong channel for such things, but the stuff I have is strictly jquery/js work
[07:39:36] <cortexman> my first line of code didn't have a semicolon at the end.. and it was completely confused.
[07:39:40] <smykes> kit there is a freelance channel iirc
[07:39:53] <k1t> smykes: ##iirc ??
[07:40:14] <xmaddness> raj: yeah I found it, thanks
[07:40:17] <k1t> lol sorry if that went right over my head
[07:42:46] <teetimus> where can i find some complex examples using each() ?
[07:43:46] <jillescode> hey guys, I have a div (#list) with a li with 5 names in it, I want those 5 names into a javascript array, how would I do this?
[07:43:47] <MikeH> teetimus: define complex?
[07:43:54] <MikeH> What are you trying to do?
[07:44:06] <jillescode> 5 li's with 5 different names*
[07:44:31] <teetimus> MikeH, examples that make you go wow, i could have thought of that?
[07:45:36] <MikeH> jillescode: something like $('li').each(function(e){ somearray[] = e.html(); } ?
[07:45:56] <jillescode> MikeH: I'll try that 1 sec
[07:46:20] <ajpiano> teetimus: .each is an iterator that gives you a closure, it's not the type of thing that makes you go "wow"
[07:46:24] <MikeH> It's very rough, and the syntax may not be 100%
[07:46:30] <MikeH> but the idea should work
[07:47:04] <ajpiano> MikeH: jillescode that's when you use map
[07:47:13] <ajpiano> ?g when to use jquery's map methods
[07:47:46] <teetimus> $('tabe tr td').each() if i put a table in an each loop, how might i select more than one *type* of element within that table?
[07:48:35] <teetimus> pick them out specifically
[07:49:44] <teetimus> is it possible?
[07:50:02] <nFFF> $(this).find
[07:50:41] <raj> Jon47, I can't do what you suggested, cuz notice how the canvas object is btwn a <td></td>
[07:51:52] <raj> I've got an array with some strings defining dom elements. var myarray=['<td></td>','<td><canvas></canvas></td>','<td><td>']. I've selected the canvas element being created with var mycanvas=$(myarray[1]).find('canvas'). And I'm then doing a drawImage into mycanvas. But how can I place this new and improved canvas element back into the original myarray?
[07:52:08] <mbrevda> how can I parse chucked data as it comes in?
[07:52:49] <Jon47> raj I think you might want to build a document fragment then
[07:52:55] <Jon47> but honestly I don't see what hte point of all this is
[07:53:16] <thinkerbell> !l
[07:53:54] <Jon47> raj: http://ejohn.org/apps/workshop/adv-talk/#6
[07:57:52] <Jon30> In my html I have something like this: <li style="margin-left:20; z-index:5">Test1 </li>. I want to be able to get this object based on its z-index value. So something like this: $('li[style="*zindex=5*"]') ...this doesn't work though, I am looking for the right syntax
[07:58:28] <xec_> raj: myarray[1] = $($(myarray[1]).find('td').html(mycanvas)); FTW!!
[07:58:34] <jillescode> so guys, I have like 200 thumbnails to load, and after it's loaded it shows 2 arrows to scroll trough them, not I want my loading.gif to show untill my whole picture div is loaded, how would I do this?
[07:58:34] <xec_> harharhar
[07:58:40] <Jon47> Jon30 you can't really use css applied styles to search in the DOM like that
[07:59:00] <Jon47> recommendation would be to use a css class to apply that syle, and then search the DOM for nodes with that class
[07:59:05] <xec_> no wait
[07:59:14] <Xotix> How do i set the height of the whole scrollbar of jScrollPane?
[07:59:25] <xec_> raj: myarray[1] = $($(myarray[1]).find('td').html(mycanvas)[0]); maybe? :D
[07:59:33] <xec_> i give up
[08:00:29] <xec_> my point was this: code often speaks to you. in this case it is shouting "doing it wrong!"
[08:00:44] <smykes> my code calls me names :/
[08:00:46] <mdhopkins> hi, getting uncaught reference error: defined is not defined" in a query mobile plugin. have jq and jqm linked. what am I missing? https://gist.github.com/a69176797d839ee605de
[08:00:46] <johnkpaul> raj: you're trying to update a canvas that is in memory?
[08:00:54] <johnkpaul> and not in the DOM?
[08:01:04] <raj> right
[08:01:12] <johnkpaul> also, I agree with xec_, this is not the right way to do it
[08:01:26] <johnkpaul> oddly overengineered, what are you really trying to get done here?
[08:01:31] <johnkpaul> you want to write to a canvas that is hidden?
[08:01:42] <raj> I have columns I'm trying to add onto a table
[08:02:02] <raj> so each <td> of the column is sitting in an array
[08:02:24] <raj> I had no problem when I was working with rows
[08:02:35] <raj> but with the column, I'm updating a regular old array
[08:02:40] <johnkpaul> so the canvas has nothing to do with it
[08:02:43] <raj> so I need to put the canvas with the drawn image back into the array
[08:02:53] <raj> right
[08:02:55] <johnkpaul> you have an array of strings that are like <td></td>, and you want to put that into a tr that is already in the dom?
[08:02:56] <raj> it could be any elemen
[08:02:57] <raj> t
[08:03:10] <raj> right
[08:03:14] <raj> I'm doing that using each()
[08:03:28] <johnkpaul> so you have a tr somewhere that you're adding this to
[08:03:40] <xec_> smykes: my code speaks to me all the time, but often in chinese, and i have no idea what it's on about
[08:03:57] <johnkpaul> $("tr").append(arrayOfTds.join(""));
[08:04:05] <johnkpaul> should do what you're looking for, raj
[08:04:30] <raj> there are multiple tr's though
[08:04:59] <raj> can I do this? data.column_array[1] = $canvas.wrap('<td></td>')[0]
[08:05:19] <raj> cuz it doesn't seem to be working
[08:05:58] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @raj
[08:05:58] <bot-t> raj, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[08:06:02] <mdhopkins> where is the "define" function defined?
[08:06:05] <johnkpaul> this seems overcomplicated
[08:06:13] <johnkpaul> mdhopkins: looking for ##php?
[08:06:24] <xec_> raj: i don't think that would work no
[08:06:41] <mdhopkins> johnkpaul: no, i have a query mobile plugin that is trying to call that function. i don't know what i'm missing.
[08:06:45] <ajpiano> mdhopkins: define comes from an AMD loader
[08:06:51] <xec_> raj: but like johnkpaul said, something to work with would be nice, see ?demo
[08:06:51] <bot-t> raj, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:07:00] <ajpiano> i don't think you are meant to be using the jquery mobile plugins standalone
[08:07:02] <raj> k
[08:07:12] <mdhopkins> ajpiano: Where do I get the AMD loader? I am including jquery mobile in my header.
[08:07:26] <ajpiano> mdhopkins: are you familiar in the slightest with the term "AMD" or is that the first time you have ever seen it
[08:07:51] <mdhopkins> first time. i've never used query mobile before. i want its abstracted click/tap library.
[08:08:06] <ajpiano> so yeah, this is gonna be a bit of a complicated thing
[08:08:11] <mdhopkins> that's okay.
[08:08:14] <ajpiano> if you've never even heard of what AMD is
[08:08:46] <ajpiano> it's a dependency management and script loading system ... it stands for "asynchronous module definition"
[08:08:50] <mdhopkins> here's the gist of my includes. i'm using jquery's libraries without issues.https://gist.github.com/a69176797d839ee605de
[08:09:01] <ajpiano> loaders like http://requirejs.org and curljs use it
[08:09:08] <ajpiano> and jquery mobile uses it for dependency management
[08:09:17] <ajpiano> but i don't think it's meant to be exposed at all from jqm
[08:09:48] <ajpiano> mdhopkins: i'm not entirely sure that individual modules from jqm are able to be pulled out atomically like htat
[08:10:24] <mdhopkins> ajpiano: I tried not including it, but then my code says the vmousedown method can't be found. feel like i'm missing something stupid here.
[08:10:35] <ajpiano> i don't really know
[08:10:48] <ajpiano> mdhopkins: Wilto here works on jqm, might be able to assist if you re-ask your question
[08:11:17] <xec_> i thought you had to choose between normal jQuery and jQuery mobile? looks like you got both?
[08:11:23] <Wilto> Reporting in.
[08:11:52] <ihsw> when inside of a mouseenter callback, doing $(e.target).parent() is returning an [Object object], why? i need all the regular jquery methods but they're not available
[08:12:44] <ajpiano> mdhopkins: ^^
[08:14:10] <johnkpaul> ihsw: a jquery object is still a regular object, and it will have a toString of [Object object]
[08:14:17] <johnkpaul> ?eval $().toString()
[08:14:19] <bot-t> johnkpaul: "[object Object]"
[08:14:39] <johnkpaul> if the jQuery methods aren't available, then there's some other problem
[08:15:23] <ihsw> johnkpaul: i'm getting 'Object [object Object] has no method' whenever i try $(e.target).parent().attr("foo")
[08:15:53] <johnkpaul> hmm, in IE?
[08:15:57] <johnkpaul> can you switch $ to jQuery
[08:16:03] <johnkpaul> ?jQuery().toString()
[08:16:05] <ihsw> Chrome, and switchign to jQuery does nothing
[08:16:06] <bot-t> johnkpaul, #5523 (overrided toString not copied in IE by $.extend)  jQuery ... - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5523
[08:16:30] <johnkpaul> can you give the rest of the error
[08:16:33] <johnkpaul> or does it just say "has no method."
[08:16:48] <ihsw> johnkpaul: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'hasAttr'
[08:16:49] <mdhopkins> Wilto: Hi, i've got a problem trying to use vmousedown and query mobile in general. i updated the gist to contain all the info. https://gist.github.com/a69176797d839ee605de
[08:16:55] <xec_> ihsw: what is the e variable?
[08:17:04] <xmaddness> event
[08:17:14] <ihsw> xec_: it's the first parameter in a mouseenter/mouseleave callback
[08:17:38] <xmaddness> e.target refers to the target the event occured on
[08:17:59] <xec_> xmaddness: only if it's supplied to the function as "e" ;)
[08:18:00] <ihsw> more specifically $(".foo").live({mouseenter: function(e){}, mouseleave: function(e){});
[08:18:11] <xec_> which was my point, but it seems ihsw got it right
[08:18:40] <xec_> ihsw: just in case you could try console.log(e) and see what you get, just to make sure
[08:18:59] <ihsw> $(e.target) reports the correct element, but and $(e.target).parent() also returns the correct element, but after .parent() it has no regular jquery methods
[08:19:26] <xec_> that doesn't sound right
[08:21:08] <Wilto> mdhopkins: At a glance, it looks like this one might be on us. Let me check up on it real quick.
[08:21:22] <mdhopkins> Wilto: thanks, much appreciated.
[08:22:44] <xec_> ihsw: works in my mockup: http://jsfiddle.net/kvxg7/
[08:25:14] <ihsw> xec_: that looks good, i'm sure it's a problem on my end...i'm going to continue investigating
[08:25:47] <Wilto> mdhopkins: You can’t really include individual files that way—in the repo, we’re using Require.js to bind everything together. If you try to pull one file and include it after the fact, it’s gonna look for Require.js and break. You can, of course, remove the Require.js-specific code.
[08:26:11] <Wilto> But the fact that you’d need to include …vmouse.js again could indicate that something else is wrong.
[08:27:25] <JA|2> itatitat:
[08:27:57] <Wilto> mdhopkins: Would you mind filing an issue with a test case, so we can look into this?
[08:28:09] <mdhopkins> Wilto: sure, I can do that. link?
[08:28:14] <xec_> was i mistaken by the way? is it fine to include both normal jquery and jquery mobile?
[08:28:28] <DrMabuse> hello all
[08:28:32] <Wilto> mdhopkins: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues
[08:28:41] <Wilto> And a test case using jsfiddle would be awesome.
[08:28:43] <Wilto> Appreciate it.
[08:28:55] <itatitat> jai2:
[08:29:01] <itatitat> JAI:
[08:29:17] <itatitat> JA|2:
[08:29:40] <DrMabuse> i have one Question about load() i d an ajax() this on send me html now i each the item list inside and want to get the height() and width() from my image but is always 0
[08:31:11] <DrMabuse> thats my code http://paste.pocoo.org/show/586039/
[08:31:45] <DrMabuse> anyone can show me an example i mean load tell eme when the img is finished
[08:31:52] <DrMabuse> but it doesn't looks so
[08:31:56] <mdhopkins> xec_: tried not including query and i get query not defined in query mobile.
[08:32:04] <mdhopkins> not including jquery*
[08:32:06] <xec_> right
[08:32:19] <xec_> it's just built on top i guess
[08:32:48] <mdhopkins> xec_: this is bringing back all my college fears about c++ not compiling. :( of course this wouldn't work for me.
[08:34:02] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, jQuery has to be in there.
[08:34:13] <Wilto> It’s a jQuery UI kind of thing, built on top of jQuery.
[08:37:59] <sekretskwerl> How can I make Typeahead from Bootstrap work when it is passed an Object? I need to keep the object's id and its 'name' attribute, but I want Typeahead to display the names, then when I click a name it fills the hidden input field with that element's id. So far, I have been unsuccessful at this.
[08:40:33] <lotus> hey, I'm trying to filter images from dropped html -- I'm using $(e.originalEvent.dataTransfer.getData('text/html')).filter('img'); but it returns blank. Running just the first bit: $(e.originalEvent.dataTransfer.getData('text/html')) returns the span that contains the image and nothing else, but running e.originalEvent.dataTransfer.getData('text/html') returns all the html -- any help?
[08:42:37] <lotus> I guess I'm wondering how to create a collection from a string of html?
[08:44:50] <ihsw> curious...the method 'hasAttr' is not available, but 'attr' is
[08:44:56] <xec_> you can just dump a html string in the jquery function $(htmlString)
[08:45:10] <cortexman> ihsw it's overloaded to get/set
[08:45:13] <lotus> xec_: That's what I did, but it returns only a list with the parent element
[08:45:37] <cortexman> i'm near the end of my rope on this: http://jsfiddle.net/BevNM/  just want it to append a couple of links to a div, but it never happens
[08:45:38] <lotus> i.e. $("<span><div><img src="..."></div></span>");
[08:45:40] <lotus> returns only span
[08:45:42] <xec_> lotus: if you only wanted images do .find("img")  on it?
[08:46:05] <lotus> xec_: I did filter('img') in console and it returns an empty list?
[08:46:22] <lotus> xec_: hah find
[08:46:26] <lotus> xec_: I love you
[08:46:29] <smykes> xec_ is there any way to know whether or not the dropdown options are showing in a <select>
[08:46:41] <xec_> right, find looks at descendants and filter looks at top node(s)
[08:47:19] <xec_> smykes: like, if it's open or not?
[08:47:23] <smykes> yeah
[08:47:26] <xec_> no idea :D
[08:47:34] <smykes> blue isn't workable
[08:47:43] <smykes> because you have to click off it for it to trigger
[08:47:48] <smykes> if its closed it could still have focus
[08:47:55] <xec_> blue?
[08:48:02] <smykes> blur
[08:48:05] <xec_> oh right
[08:48:48] <JA|2> itatitat: what time we finish?
[08:48:58] <itatitat> 15 min
[08:49:09] <JA|2> itatitat: done XD
[08:49:36] <lotus> xec_: will find also grab the img tag if it's the only element/
[08:50:05] <xec_> lotus: as long as it's not the top level element. if it might be you'll need to wrap it first
[08:51:05] <xec_> lotus: something like $("<div>").html(myString).find("img")
[08:55:27] <mdhopkins> Wilto: not sure if jsfiddle will help you. I am using query mobile 1.10. Also, I'm creating a sprite animation with images generated by PHP. is it okay to create an issue without a jsfiddle test?
[08:57:38] <raj> can I build up a jquery object without appending it to the dom?
[08:58:03] <illoomn8> is there a way to specify an or operand in the initial $("#thisid" || "#thatid").soon ?
[08:58:21] <Wilto> mdhopkins: The goal is to create the smallest case wherein you can reproduce the issue, as independent of your codebase as possible—the more you can pare it down, the more easily we’ll be able to solve the problem.
[08:58:37] <mdhopkins> Wilto: okay, I'll see what I can do.
[09:04:48] <mdhopkins> Wilto: Ah, figured it out. you have to do .bind('vmousedown', function() {}) not .vmousedown. DURRRR. thanks.
[09:05:12] <Wilto> Oh, didn’t even see that—good catch.
[09:09:42] <nFFF> raj, what do you mean exactly, jQuery objects are a collection of DOM objects,
[09:10:11] <raj> nFFF, I'd like to create DOM objects to be appended at a later time
[09:10:28] <raj> but I need them to be jquery objects so I can work with them in the mean time (before appending them)
[09:11:14] <nFFF> $('<div class="hai">hai</div>')
[09:12:07] <nFFF> ?eval var x = $('<div class="hai">hai</div>'); console.log(x);
[09:12:08] <bot-t> nFFF: TypeError: div is undefined
[09:12:35] <nFFF> ignore the bot it should work :D
[09:14:40] <gho5t> is using $(".something:first-child") faster than :first or .first()
[09:15:02] <nFFF> who knows, but .first() reads better imo
[09:15:38] <gho5t> I need to know. I am programming the space shuttle and it needs to be fast
[09:15:47] <danzik17> gho5t: it's faster, but it's also different - make sure it's what you want.  between :first and .first(), they're the same, but .first() is faster.
[09:15:48] <Jon47> .first is faster than :first
[09:15:56] <quicksilver> gho5t: nFFF: first-child is of course completely different from first
[09:15:56] <Jon47> what he said ;)
[09:16:08] <quicksilver> is an apple faster than an orange?
[09:16:11] <gho5t> right. first-child will work in my case
[09:16:27] <gho5t> so if it's fastest, I want to use it
[09:16:29] <gho5t> which it sounds like it is
[09:16:55] <nFFF> :o
[09:20:35] <raj> nFFF, k, thanks. somehow still having issues
[09:20:43] <raj> johnkpaul, you askd for a mock up, so --> http://jsfiddle.net/nfRSV/
[09:22:29] <c0d3rg1rl> Cork: FYI, the bug about createElement which I submitted earlier has been closed, it will not be fixed.
[09:22:44] <c0d3rg1rl> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11620
[09:24:54] <johnkpaul> raj: so the issue with your code is that you're appending the string
[09:25:02] <johnkpaul> when the string is passed to jQuery, it creates _new_ dom elements
[09:25:15] <raj> k
[09:25:20] <johnkpaul> not the one that you created on line 10
[09:25:50] <raj> that's why I wanted to replace the string with the updated $canvas I created
[09:25:52] <johnkpaul> so you need to store that jQuery object, and use that when you append, and that will use the underlying dom element
[09:25:57] <raj> but I need it wrapped in <td>
[09:26:04] <johnkpaul> ?wrap @raj
[09:26:05] <bot-t> raj, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[09:26:17] <johnkpaul> I'm confused about something though....
[09:26:20] <raj> wrap didn't do it though, not sure why
[09:26:30] <johnkpaul> you want the same canvas to appear in multiple rows?
[09:26:35] <johnkpaul> so you need multiple canvases
[09:26:40] <raj> multiple columns
[09:27:00] <johnkpaul> for each tr, you are appending a new canvas
[09:27:04] <johnkpaul> is that not intended behavior?
[09:27:25] <raj> no, I'm appending each item in column_array
[09:27:38] <raj> to its corresponding tr
[09:28:08] <johnkpaul> ooh, I see
[09:28:33] <johnkpaul> this is more complicated than it needs to be, give me a few minutes and I'll get back to you
[09:28:52] <raj> kk, thanks
[09:35:36] <johnkpaul> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/nfRSV/1/
[09:36:39] <mdhopkins> Having trouble disabling JQM's ajax link hijacking, but everything seems to check out. What am I missing? https://gist.github.com/57b94d4f4fe340515217
[09:38:16] <IconicSchema> mdhopkins: $.mobile.ajaxEnabled=false
[09:39:37] <mdhopkins> IconicSchema: thanks very much.
[09:41:08] <IconicSchema> np
[09:41:53] <mdhopkins> I really wish I could just get at those mouse/tap abstractions without all the cruft.
[09:44:23] <shwaiil> Q: I've tryed to do a simple autoclear on inputbox, but it's not working. Can someone have a look ? I'm not finding the error in my logic http://jsfiddle.net/JgSn9/1/
[09:44:26] <shwaiil> Thanks for looking!
[09:46:03] <johnkpaul> shwaiil: works fine for me here in hrome 17
[09:46:30] <johnkpaul> oh, no it's not, it is removing the text in al sitautions
[09:46:36] <shwaiil> johnkpaul: doesn't work for me, you see, if you put some text, diferent from "email..." it goes back to "email..."
[09:46:41] <shwaiil> johnkpaul: yeah :P
[09:47:26] <shoky> hlo
[09:49:10] <johnkpaul> shwaiil: so the logic is off
[09:49:13] <johnkpaul> what you're saying is this...
[09:49:18] <johnkpaul> whenever the input focuses or blurs
[09:49:31] <johnkpaul> either set it to empty, or set it to the default text
[09:49:37] <johnkpaul> you have no option for leaving it alone
[09:50:02] <mdhopkins> when I click on my page I see blue outlines around some of my elements that I can toggle off by clicking on them. Does anyone know how to disable this? Can't find it in docs.
[09:50:11] <mdhopkins> That's a JQM question ^
[09:50:32] <shwaiil> johnkpaul: I see
[09:50:51] <johnkpaul> shwaiil: it is much more obvious if you remove your crazy ternary
[09:50:58] <shwaiil> I think I found the error
[09:52:04] <IconicSchema> shwaiil: if you use that method for placeholders you will run into problems if you are trying to validate client side as well
[09:52:27] <shwaiil> IconicSchema: can you give me a example ?
[09:52:46] <IconicSchema> Your default content is being added to the value, if someone submits the form it will have your default content
[09:54:13] <shwaiil> IconicSchema: I see. Thanks =D
[09:54:24] <IconicSchema> yep just keep that in mind :D
[09:54:39] <xmaddness> is nth-child 0 or 1 indexed?
[10:00:12] <raj> johnkpaul, so .get(0) is doing some magic?
[10:00:19] <johnkpaul> ?get
[10:00:19] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[10:00:25] <gnarf> don't use .get( 0 )
[10:00:28] <gnarf> use [ 0 ]
[10:00:54] <gnarf> use .get() if you want negative indexes, otherwise [] is better for retrieving a single element
[10:01:43] <raj> johnkpaul, why are you redefining column_array in line 8?
[10:02:00] <raj> what's $ in the second argument?
[10:02:08] <raj> is that making them all jquery objects?
[10:02:10] <johnkpaul> yes
[10:02:20] <raj> cool
[10:02:48] <raj> don't I have to put $canvas back into column_array?
[10:02:51] <raj> after altering it
[10:03:04] <johnkpaul> ?tias
[10:03:04] <bot-t> Try It And See
[10:03:20] <raj> ?ok
[10:03:21] <bot-t> raj, QUnit/ok - http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit/ok
[10:04:47] <johnkpaul> :)
[10:05:12] <raj> johnkpaul, does .get(0) keep it as a jquery object?
[10:05:30] <gnarf> raj: no, .get(0) returns a DOMElement
[10:05:36] <gnarf> .eq(0) returns a jQuery
[10:05:39] <raj> then why not use [0]?
[10:05:52] <gnarf> raj: see above: use .get() if you want negative indexes, otherwise [] is better for retrieving a single element
[10:06:08] <qvarkk> i get "myfunction is not a function" do to a missing js-include. how can i remove all functions calls to .myfunction()? or should i override myfunction() to only return false?
[10:06:09] <raj> k
[10:06:12] <raj> cool

[10:07:14] <shoky> i dunno ;S
[10:07:19] <shoky> its over thats the main thing ;)
[10:07:59] <raj> haha
[10:08:00] <raj> tru
[10:08:26] <qvarkk> shoky:  ?
[10:08:41] <shoky> qvarkk: just remove the calls..
[10:08:47] <mathew_boston> I'm having a weird problem where sorting sometimes doesn't work when using jQuery UI Sortable with slideToggle. Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/BNJzB/46/

[10:09:16] <shoky> my first answer told you hod
[10:09:17] <shoky> how
[10:09:21] <shoky> SEARCH
[10:09:22] <shoky> wtf
[10:09:30] <IconicSchema> geez people are rude
[10:10:23] <mathew_boston> it's weird because it seems to break depending on the window scroll position
[10:12:10] <mdhopkins> Has anyone ever seen blue lines like this caused by JQM? I haven't been able to get rid of them yet. http://imgur.com/TRF5u
[10:14:48] <mathew_boston> I'm wondering if it's a jQuery bug
[10:14:56] <jaequery> is it possible to create an entire iphone app, in html5?  and im not talking about mobile-optimized websites
[10:15:06] <johnkpaul> jaequery: look into phonegap
[10:15:28] <tw2113> boo native app preferred over web app boo
[10:15:38] * tw2113 cowers in the corner. Don't hurt me
[10:16:04] <jaequery> i dont get it
[10:16:22] <jaequery> did you mean, native apps is better?
[10:16:35] <tw2113> i would prefer web apps over native
[10:16:41] <tw2113> but that's me being picky and open source elitist
[10:16:45] <tw2113> http://www.phonegap.com/
[10:19:29] <jaequery> tw2113: thats really cool
[10:19:58] <jaequery> tw2113: just how easy/hard is it to start deploying iphone apps if you are already a html5 developer?
[10:20:07] <Jon47> i would love it if web apps could interact with some of the things that native apps can - push notifications and badges and such, i use native apps when i have to :(
[10:20:08] <tw2113> i dunno
[10:20:10] <tw2113> i'm not an iphone app dev
[10:20:12] <shoky> mathew_boston: 'drop' is a 'droppable' event, not a 'sortable' one
[10:20:17] <tw2113> i've only had an iphone for 16 days
[10:21:36] <IconicSchema> its recieve isn't it?
[10:22:53] <mathew_boston> Thanks! I tried removing the 'drop' section, but I still see the same issue
[10:22:59] <Noeble> question: I do a few jsongets on a page of mine. Works fine! Except in IE8+.. it seems like IE caches the resaults.. so if I change something it wont show when I refresh. How can I solve this?
[10:23:39] <tw2113> uninstall IE8 :)
[10:23:48] <tw2113> otherwise i'm going to hell for being mouthy
[10:23:56] <IconicSchema> mathew_boston: try calling .sortable("refreshPositions") when toggling the accordian
[10:24:22] <Noeble> tw2113: I asume your talking to me =) And it wont be popular towards my end users =)
[10:25:03] <tw2113> check for IE and if it is, give them a huge Firefox logo with the download link
[10:25:06] <tw2113> or if you're slightly more cruel, Chrome
[10:27:16] <jaequery> is http://jquerymobile.com/ for mobile site development or mobile app development?
[10:28:12] <IconicSchema> its for site development, but can be used for native development too by using something like http://www.phonegap.com
[10:28:38] <jaequery> so what is phonegap? is it like a js to native compiler?
[10:28:51] <raj> johnkpaul, works beautifully
[10:28:53] <raj> thank you
[10:28:59] <johnkpaul> awesome, no problem
[10:29:26] <prc384> hello jquery
[10:29:38] <IconicSchema> jaequery: http://www.phonegap.com
[10:29:48] <mdhopkins> solved my earlier question. :) var cnt = $(".ui-page").contents(); $(".ui-page").replaceWith(cnt);
[10:29:59] <smykes> ajpiano is there like an onclose event for <select>s?
[10:30:12] <smykes> ajpiano on blur isn't cutting it
[10:30:16] <ajpiano> smykes: no
[10:30:31] <smykes> ajpiano will you look at something for me?
[10:30:50] <ajpiano> i can take a peek
[10:31:02] <raj> johnkpaul, should I be calling it `column_array` or `$column_array`?
[10:31:12] <raj> like does that .map create a proper jquery object?
[10:31:26] <johnkpaul> raj: it creates an array of jquery objects
[10:31:29] <raj> k
[10:31:31] <raj> cool
[10:31:32] <smykes> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/T6z2j/50/
[10:31:35] <johnkpaul> column_array itself is not a jquery object
[10:31:46] <smykes> ajpiano that kind of does what I want but its buggy
[10:31:58] <smykes> ajpiano like if you select two options quickly right after one another
[10:32:09] <ajpiano> i don't know what you're trying to do
[10:32:10] <mathew_boston> IconicSchema, I tried that but no luck.
[10:32:18] <ajpiano> but it's painful to use
[10:32:19] <ajpiano> :|
[10:32:23] <jcp_> any ideas on how i could stop the sidebar from overlapping the footer? http://jsfiddle.net/9QRER/2/
[10:32:37] <smykes> ajpiano it is advanced search
[10:33:01] <ajpiano> that explains it 0% more
[10:33:05] <raj> johnkpaul, how is altering $canvas, altering the actual element within the array?
[10:33:08] <smykes> ajpiano the idea is you can select from the dropdown even when it is off the searchPanelWrapper and it doesn't disapear
[10:33:21] <raj> I thought it would have created a new element in that variable
[10:33:28] <IconicSchema> jcp_: using z-index
[10:33:52] <ajpiano> smykes: sorry this is a bit too much for me to dig into right now
[10:33:54] <jcp_> IconicSchema: on the footer so it cuts it off?
[10:34:06] <smykes> ajpiano I understand
[10:34:12] <ajpiano> i would advise like, replacing the native <select> with a js progressive enhancement of it though
[10:34:16] <smykes> ajpiano thanks for at leas tlooking
[10:34:19] <ajpiano> if you need such gradular control of all these events
[10:34:23] <ajpiano> granular*
[10:34:28] <smykes> ajpiano I am using chosen
[10:34:43] <smykes> but it degrades back to normal dropdowns in 7 and 8
[10:35:05] <ajpiano> bummer :|
[10:35:24] <smykes> yes, much suck indeed
[10:36:01] <ajpiano> smykes: you could consider creating a less complex interface for < ie8
[10:36:03] <IconicSchema> jcp_: #aside { z-index:1; } #footer { position:relative; z-index:2 }
[10:36:23] <smykes> ajpiano it is 8 and 7
[10:36:26] <smykes> yeah I guess I could
[10:36:57] <Juv1228> anyone here mind telling me how this looks?
[10:37:02] <Juv1228> http://hs.juvsoft.com:8888/

[10:37:47] <ajpiano> heh
[10:38:28] <shoky> Juv1228: it looks like a media player. with no media. lots of blank spac
[10:38:29] <shoky> e
[10:38:42] <Juv1228> shoky, what browser?
[10:38:48] <shoky> chrome
[10:38:52] <smykes> if ajpiano says it cant be done it cant be done
[10:39:04] <shoky> the slider is moving even tho i didn't click
[10:39:20] <Juv1228> hmm, oh. derp. it loads the tracks dynamically, on a different port
[10:40:00] <Juv1228> i had this thing working mint, and i lost all the html/css/javascript
[10:41:12] <Virtuall> Hi guys. Is there any ready-to-use incremental text input handling code/plugin? With timeouts and stuff, but not directly tied to some ajax service?
[10:42:03] <shoky> wat
[10:43:34] <raj> can I do $('table>tbody:last>tr') to select the tr's of the last tbody?
[10:43:58] <shoky> thinkso

[11:07:26] <jrred> can someone help?
[11:12:25] <gehsekky> jrred: if you could deconstruct your problem to its simplest state and put it up on jsfiddle.com, you'd probably get a lot more offers to help
[11:14:29] <catcher> jrred, how is the jquery function querying the script for the data?
[11:15:44] <jrred> thanks gehsekky, i put it up here: http://jsfiddle.net/EySVx/ this is a bit complex because it's using flask
[11:16:09] <jrred> catcher: it's happening in this function: function(data) {$("#result").html(data.result);
[11:16:36] <kapo7789> 2rhodesjason: http://jsfiddle.net/jfEsR
[11:16:41] <catcher> jrred, where does the action to fetch the data happen though?
[11:16:45] <kapo7789> maybe recursion should help?
[11:17:09] <catcher> jrred, ah, the click handler, I see your code now.
[11:17:46] <jrred> catcher: also, this is what the script is returning: {"response": ["Coffee?", "Haworth Coffeehouse", "David's Bagels and Coffee Roasters",

[11:25:05] <jrred> any ideas catcher?
[11:25:32] <vl1234> no no
[11:26:27] <catcher> jrred, you may try adding format: "json" to your .getJSON args
[11:26:57] <jrred> catcher: where would that go?
[11:27:01] <rhodesjason> jrred: interesting! unrelated question: how are you getting that div to _move_ instead of just fade in and out?
[11:27:20] <jrred> rhodesjason: i think you're talking to someone else!
[11:27:34] <rhodesjason> jrred: I certainly am
[11:27:35] <kapo7789> 2vl1234, use overflow: hidden
[11:27:38] <jrred> haha
[11:27:39] <rhodesjason> good catch
[11:27:46] <rhodesjason> let's try this again
[11:27:53] <rhodesjason> kapo7789:
[11:27:56] <rhodesjason> kapo7789: interesting! unrelated question: how are you getting that div to _move_ instead of just fade in and out?
[11:28:00] <kapo7789> ))
[11:28:16] <catcher> jrred, above your 'a: ' line
[11:28:55] <kapo7789> rhodesjason: id' like to know how this happend also, but i guess it's just how things apperar/dissapear using show/hide func
[11:29:11] <catcher> jrred, what is your goal with the a: b: c: lines?
[11:29:27] <jrred> those are catching values from 3 different forms
[11:29:32] <rhodesjason> haha wait what? you didn't mean to make it animate like that? i use hide() and show() all the time and never get that effect…
[11:29:41] <jrred> basically passing parameters
[11:29:42] <rhodesjason> kapo7789: ^^
[11:29:42] <catcher> jrred, I see
[11:29:59] <kapo7789> regarding your problem, you can use global var, incrementing on every recur(), so you could limit your loop to any iterations u need
[11:30:28] <vl1234> hi hi http://jsfiddle.net/VqhJ7/ see this example
[11:30:36] <kapo7789> rhodesjason: it's all there, i don't have hidden code there))
[11:31:06] <jrred> sorry to ask cather but do you mind telling me exactly where format: "json"  would go? is it before the {

[11:36:25] <catcher> jrred, if your success handler is getting the data back properly, that won't help.  Can you console.log your data in the success handler?
[11:37:17] <jrred> catcher: not sure what that means
[11:38:11] <vl1234> bot-t.....am not understand........better u see this example http://jsfiddle.net/VqhJ7/6/
[11:38:21] <jrred> i can see the response in the network tab in chrome
[11:39:35] <vl1234> how to truncate that last word........that 'here'
[11:39:50] <vl1234> \its simple but i dont know how to do it
[11:39:55] <catcher> jrred, are you using a debugger?
[11:40:05] <catcher> firebug, etc.?
[11:40:12] <jrred> yes, using the chrome inspector
[11:41:35] <catcher> jrred, http://jsfiddle.net/EySVx/2/
[11:41:45] <catcher> jrred, then watch your console, and have a look at the response.
[11:41:57] <ian_> hello. i need to create a function that gets triggered whenever any other function is called. how can I accomplish this?
[11:43:08] <swe_ET> ian_: sorry but why ? :)
[11:43:22] <catcher> jrred, oh - I think you want data.response instead of data.result in your success handler
[11:44:16] <RoaDin> Heya All, could someone take a look at my code and tell me what I'm doing wrong to make it hide agian http://jsfiddle.net/tcJHQ/1/ there is a version that I have that is using a var that work, but I'm trying to make the code work with less.
[11:44:31] <jrred> catcher: this is what came back on the console: http://cl.ly/312t462N3R0n0d1x1c0Q
[11:44:55] <ian_> swe_ET: boss demands it. is this possible?
[11:45:07] <jrred> data.response returns an error along with those objects
[11:45:40] <catcher> what's the error for data.response?
[11:45:57] <jrred> Uncaught Error: NOT_FOUND_ERR: DOM Exception 8
[11:46:30] <catcher> jrred, is this what you have now? http://jsfiddle.net/EySVx/3/
[11:46:54] <jrred> shoot, forgot to change data.response on the console.log one sec

[11:48:58] <jrred> catcher: btw, i changed html(data.response) to text(data.response) and the error went away, but it still didn't render the results
[11:49:05] <catcher> jrred, ah, I think it's because you're trying to html-ify an array. You should .each() through them and append them.
[11:49:39] <jrred> how so catcher?
[11:50:44] <catcher> jrred, sec
[11:52:33] <primeras> please help :(

[12:00:08] <primeras> shoky, well, I write just console.log(e); ve I looked matches.. later console.log(e.originalEvent.target.value);

[12:00:19] <shoky> primeras, 1 sec
[12:00:25] <primeras> okay
[12:01:20] <RoaDin> Could someone take a look at this and tell me whats wrong with it? http://jsfiddle.net/tcJHQ/1/
[12:02:31] <catcher> RoaDin, you're using css set instead of get in your conditionals

[12:03:30] <catcher> np
[12:03:42] <raj> any way to see objects in IE, the way they are in chrome and ff?
[12:03:57] <RoaDin> was half asleep when I wrote it, I guess I should of reread it this morning.
[12:04:04] <raj> IE just shows "[Object object]", the way the other browsers do if I did an alert() of an object
[12:04:18] <Eviltwin> You can render them into HTML

[12:15:08] <minna1> There is a CMS script that runs a function, is there any way i can "tap into it" and run my own function instead when it is executed?
[12:15:29] <monk14> BaruchHashem, you want something like this?:  $('.class,.class2,.class3').addClass('classAll');

[12:20:22] <JAAulde> minna: monitor when a func runs: var foo = function(){console.log('original foo functionality');}, bar = foo; foo = function(){console.log('original foo about to run...'); bar();};
[12:22:11] <minna> So im wrapping the function in a function, then when original function executes the wrapped function also runs?

[12:39:09] <rhodesjason> ian_: whenever _ANY_ other function is called, ever?
[12:40:27] <ian_> rhodesjason: hmm i suppose a finite list of functions. i am looking for an alternative to making the function call in each of about a dozen possible subsequent functions the user could trigger
[12:40:28] <blar42> hello all; have a question about using the $('#id') selector and i'm not sure how to properly google it, so i thought i'd drop in here
[12:41:34] <blar42> trying to iterate an array containing element id names, then get the value of inputs with those id's, so var x=['#id1', ...] and for (i in x){ $(i).val()---do something
[12:41:50] <ian_> rhodesjason: like, if i had an array of function names, could i attach a 'before function' to get called whenever a function within my array is triggered?
[12:41:52] <blar42> when i try to select elements in that manner, i keep getting empty arrays
[12:41:59] <IconicSchema> ian_: you can use .trigger() https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CEUQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.jquery.com%2Ftrigger%2F&ei=UbCVT-icEaOO2wXn7vDtBA&usg=AFQjCNGLuGYHWWeQhKsrAr93zESrhmMFEw
[12:42:00] <IconicSchema> oops
[12:42:07] <IconicSchema> lol sorry http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:42:40] <blar42> is there some reason the selector function would not evaluate the string values contained in the variables?
[12:42:54] <blar42> or am i missing something in how jquery is supposed to be used?
[12:45:34] <pifantastic> blar42: no, that should work

[12:49:30] <shoky> grab?
[12:51:10] <bobsuncle> shoky: yes, what .text() does
[12:51:23] <NoiseEee> bobsuncle: http://jsfiddle.net/TYr3n/1/
[12:51:24] <shoky> the input has no children

[12:52:34] <shoky> sure way for him to learn nothing ;p
[12:53:09] <IconicSchema> I find reading code examples extremely informative
[12:53:09] <bobsuncle> sorry, I had $('label') there before
[12:53:15] <blar42> pifantastic: trying to figure out jsfiddle; how do i go about getting a link to what i've entered?
[12:53:28] <shoky> of course they're informative..
[12:53:38] <blar42> oh; perhaps the "save" button was my answer
[12:53:38] <pifantastic> blar42: just save your fiddle and it will generate a unique link
[12:53:42] <sphinxxx> bobsuncle: you want $('input').parent('label').text();
[12:53:42] <blar42> pifantastic: http://jsfiddle.net/HmMmW/
[12:53:43] <pifantastic> blar42: yep
[12:53:50] <shoky> information is always available
[12:54:13] <bobsuncle> sphinxxx: I had exactly that before and it worked in 1.7.1, however when I upgraded to 1.7.2 it now returns [object Object]
[12:54:31] <sphinxxx> bobsuncle:  i can't say for 1.7.2, i only use 1.7.1
[12:54:39] <blar42> pifantastic: just sketching that out - not sure that i have this wired properly yet
[12:54:43] <sphinxxx> but that jsfiddle is on 1.7.2 and it seems to work fine
[12:54:57] <bobsuncle> humm yeah, let me try it on my code
[12:55:20] <blar42> pifantastic: http://jsfiddle.net/HmMmW/1/  i was missing a semicolon
[12:56:42] <IconicSchema> you couldalways to it this way: http://jsfiddle.net/7EDSz/1/
[12:57:53] <pifantastic> blar42: http://jsfiddle.net/HmMmW/3/
[12:58:07] <pifantastic> that is a more "jQuery" way to do it
[12:58:17] <pifantastic> but you never want to use alert()
[12:58:22] <pifantastic> never ever ever
[12:58:38] <ctk> Just curious... this works, but I wonder if there is a better way to handle it http://jsfiddle.net/ibike365/uVsZA/
[12:58:39] <blar42> heh; thx.  i'm more c# dev than js
[12:58:46] <pifantastic> blar42: no worries
[12:59:01] <pifantastic> blar42: never use "for var x in" to iterate through an array in javascript
[12:59:08] <blar42> why so?

[13:05:48] <ctk> anyone?
[13:06:47] <bobsuncle> yeah, I still get [object Object].. I think it's related to this: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9427#comment:16
[13:08:03] <pifantastic> ctk: I dont see why you need that bind at all
[13:08:21] <pifantastic> ctk: althought I would need to see more code to say that for sure
[13:08:39] <ctk> it's a method in a singleton object
[13:09:05] <ctk> so I don't have access to this inside the click event otherwise
[13:09:34] <pifantastic> hmm
[13:09:35] <ctk> so when I bind (this) to it, I lose it's this
[13:09:43] <ctk> in the click
[13:09:55] <pifantastic> So bindOptionClickEvents doesnt really do anything?
[13:10:05] <sphinxxx> bobsuncle:  yea that seems to be the car if its empty
[13:10:08] <pifantastic> because that IIFE doesnt return anything
[13:10:08] <sphinxxx> case*
[13:10:21] <pifantastic> so you never actually call/use bindOptionClickEvents
[13:10:31] <pifantastic> seems like you would be better served with a Singleton.init()
[13:10:39] <pifantastic> and then you would not need the bind
[13:10:49] <pifantastic> as you would be in the scope of the Singleton
[13:10:55] <ctk> Yeah I could do that
[13:11:07] <ctk> you mean Singleton.handClickEvent()
[13:11:31] <ctk> was just kind of curious more than anything... this works
[13:12:52] <bobsuncle> sphinxxx: it's not, I really don't get it, it works in jsFiddle, but not in my code
[13:13:47] <bobsuncle> and it stopped working when I upgraded to 1.7.2
[13:13:52] <bobsuncle> the HTML hasn't changed

[13:30:32] <xmcp> Hey huysWe have had everything working for weeks. This morning, without a code update to the parts that would impact this(all we added was an IE detection script), all cross domain ajax requests started failing. We have crossdomain.xml setup, we are sending the Access-Control-Allow-Origin * header, and we are setting the cookie like var=val; expires=Mon, 23-Apr-2012 20:33:43 GMT; path=/;
[13:30:33] <xmcp> domain=.ourdomain.com
[13:30:33] <xmcp> 3 coders, all at a loss.
[13:30:35] <xmcp> Any ideas? I'll take anything that does not include the illuminati.
[13:30:42] <bobsuncle> pifantastic: it does, the string is '[object Object]'... this is really pissing me off
[13:30:53] <pifantastic> bobsuncle: What are you passing to $.trim?
[13:30:57] <pifantastic> why dont you console log that?
[13:31:02] <pifantastic> and see what it is?
[13:31:44] <pifantastic> bobsuncle: you could also set a breakpoint there and take a look at what is going on

[13:32:46] <bobsuncle> pifantastic: yeah, i've done that, thanks.. the problem is with .text().. in 1.7.1 it returned the actual text inside the label, and in 1.7.2 it returns [object Object]
[13:33:16] <pifantastic> bobsuncle: why does that not happen in the fiddle?
[13:33:28] <bobsuncle> pifantastic: i have *no* idea
[13:33:58] <xmcp> Any ideas on why cross domain requests that previously worked would suddenly start failing?
[13:33:58] <NoiseEee> bobsuncle: the answer is because thats not hte problem
[13:34:09] <pifantastic> bobsuncle: right^
[13:34:21] <pifantastic> bobsuncle: $.trim did not change *at all* in 1.7.2
[13:34:35] <bobsuncle> not trim(), it's .text()
[13:34:36] <NoiseEee> xmcp: did the response server stop allowing CORS?
[13:34:40] <pifantastic> grr
[13:34:42] <pifantastic> you are right
[13:34:43] <pifantastic> :D

[13:35:03] <pifantastic> but same goes for text()
[13:35:10] <xmcp> Nothing major changed on the server.
[13:35:21] <pifantastic> nope, i lie, text() did change!
[13:35:31] <bobsuncle> i know, that's what I was telling you
[13:35:55] <bobsuncle> in 1.7.1 my same code worked as expected.. in 1.7.2 .text() returns [object Object]!
[13:35:58] <yedimind> pifantastic, i think that the .text() did change
[13:36:14] <pifantastic> indeed
[13:36:26] <bobsuncle> ... and I'm really not sure why it's not displayed right in the jsFiddle.. bug?
[13:36:31] <xmcp> Cookie successfully sets to the main domain AND subdomains(we can tell if we visit it outside of ajax). And the access-control-origin header sends.
[13:36:49] <xmcp> The browsers just suddently decided not to send if the request originates with ajax
[13:37:29] <pifantastic> bobsuncle: I guess the point we're trying to make is that you should assume the bug is not in jquery.text(), because that is a *very* well tested function
[13:38:11] <bobsuncle> pifantastic: i know, it's probably something I need to change in my code to make it work again, such as what this comment aluded to: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9427#comment:16
[13:38:27] <bobsuncle> but I don't know what to change :-S
[13:38:30] <yedimind> its probably a pebkac bug of sorts
[13:38:53] <bobsuncle> could be
[13:38:57] <pifantastic> bobsuncle: are you passing something to text()
[13:39:20] <bobsuncle> pifantastic: no, the code is pretty much this: http://jsfiddle.net/7Sz6T/
[13:39:42] <bobsuncle> except that it works in jsFiddle :-S
[13:40:01] <pifantastic> bobsuncle: if you console.log($(this).parent('label').text()) what do you see?
[13:40:16] <pifantastic> what object is being toString()'d to give you "[Object object]"
[13:41:15] <bobsuncle> pifantastic: i get [ label.radio ] (the label object)
[13:41:52] <bobsuncle> which in 1.7.1 gave me the untrimmed string
[13:42:27] <pifantastic> and what about console.log($(this).parent('label')) ?
[13:42:44] <pifantastic> btw, you only need .parent()
[13:42:44] <bobsuncle> the same thing
[13:42:57] <bobsuncle> yea, you're right
[13:42:58] <shoky> rhodesjason: see console log in http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/emDAT/14/
[13:44:55] <bobsuncle> pifantastic: I guess the issue is with the <input> inside the label.. if it's there, text() returns the input object instead of the text... :-S
[13:46:42] <pifantastic> bobsuncle: if that is true, why does it work in the fiddle?
[13:47:16] <bobsuncle> pifantastic: excellent question :-)
[13:47:47] <bobsuncle> i'll just take the input out of the <label> and call it a day.. /sigh
[13:47:59] <IconicSchema> wait
[13:48:04] <IconicSchema> just do it how I mentioned earlier...
[13:48:59] <IconicSchema> http://jsfiddle.net/7EDSz/1/
[13:49:19] <IconicSchema> or instead of text use .get(0).innerText
[13:52:42] <rhodesjason> setTimeout is the devil
[13:53:59] <bobsuncle> IconicSchema: thanks, I'm trying that but e.srcElement is undefined?
[13:54:19] <bobsuncle> and .get(0).innerText as well.. ummm
[13:56:28] <IconicSchema> bobsuncle: show me what your doing
[13:57:32] <bobsuncle> IconicSchema: $('input[type="radio"]').click(function(e) { var data = $.trim(e.srcElement.labels[0].innerText); }
[13:58:58] <IconicSchema> what version of jquery are you using?
[13:59:09] <t1m_> hey guys, how to apply jquery functions to elements loaded via .ajax?
[13:59:30] <Brodingo> ?on @ t1m_
[13:59:30] <bot-t> t1m_, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:59:44] <t1m_> Brodingo: 1.6.2
[13:59:46] <IconicSchema> bobsuncle: your not closing the click function
[14:00:12] <Brodingo> ?delegate @ t1m_
[14:00:12] <bot-t> t1m_, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:01:12] <t1m_> Brodingo: should i use delegate or update to 1.7+ and use .on ?
[14:01:48] <Brodingo> if you can update
[14:02:31] <Brodingo> not sure what your situation is but using the latest is always nice :)
[14:02:41] <bobsuncle> IconicSchema: I am, further down.. srcElement is undefined for the click event (?)
[14:02:52] <t1m_> Brodingo: updating should be no problem, thanks :)
[14:03:47] <IconicSchema> use e.target
[14:06:30] <bobsuncle> IconicSchema: yeah, just noticed srcElement is not supported in Firefox.. this did it: e.target.parentElement.textContent
[14:07:33] <NoiseEee> bobsuncle: but why are you switching to vanilla JS when jquery is there?
[14:07:49] <NoiseEee> have you debugged?  is that in fact your problem?
[14:07:57] <bobsuncle> NoiseEee: because jQuery.text() is broken for me in 1.7.2
[14:08:24] <NoiseEee> and that 'fixed' it for you?
[14:08:25] <itatitat> ey guys
[14:09:08] <bobsuncle> NoiseEee: well, it returns the text that I need
[14:10:03] <itatitat> why getScript doesnt work me?
[14:10:13] <bobsuncle> anyways, thanks IconicSchema and pifantastic for the help :-)
[14:10:20] <itatitat> after to load a new content with ajax I want to load a new libreries
[14:10:27] <itatitat> by using getScript
[14:10:42] <itatitat> but I'm seeing my script doesnt any script
[14:16:46] <itatitat> hi
[14:16:51] <shoky> hy
[14:23:43] <kukku> Hi guys, does anyone know how to force a HTTP/1.0 ajax request
[14:23:53] <kukku> we have an old server we need to communicate with
[14:51:43] <sunbeam> damn i need to use a font which is 11mb and there is no way i can use it apart from with image replacement. what would you guys do?
[14:51:46] <sunbeam> use another font?
[14:53:46] <cgreninger> might run it through FontSquirrel's generator and see if it can shrink it down?
[14:55:03] <sunbeam> font squirrel's max is 2mb
[14:55:56] <creativecag> try font2web
[14:59:11] <sunbeam> creativecag: thanks, but same issue :(
[15:00:28] <sunbeam> creativecag: The file is too large, the file may not be larger than 512k.
[15:02:12] <creativecag> sunbeam: that sucks. I'm stretching a bit here but if it contains multiple faces, can you find a version online that just contains the one specific style you want?
[15:02:51] <sunbeam> creativecag: i can't, it's a font that was included in some software package 3-4 years ago
[15:04:29] <creativecag> sunbeam: i don't know what your computer skills are but if you are comfortable enough, you could install FontForge and see if it might help you out getting it to a size that you can manage. other than that, I think I'm out of initial ideas.
[15:05:56] <sunbeam> creativecag: ok thanks anyway
[15:06:07] <creativecag> sunbeam: no prob
[15:11:16] <sidc> i have a page that is loaded into a jquery dialog but the page that is loaded has click event handlers on it so the first time the dialog opens everything works fine but the second time the click events are loaded again and is causing the event to not fire anymore
[15:11:28] <sidc> how do i make it so the event is only loaded once
[15:17:47] <creativecag> I'm not certain I understand the question exactly but if you are loading the popup dynamically, use $(this).live('click',function() instead of $(this).click()
[15:18:06] <creativecag> sidc: directed at you
[15:28:16] <ML74> what's the best way to preload images?
[15:29:46] <Wilornel> ML74: preload?
[15:29:56] <ML74> yes, preload images
[15:31:16] <shoky> stackoverflow says ajax
[15:31:27] <shoky> force retrieval of the images with ajax
[15:32:14] <Wilornel> Why would you need an images preload? In which situation?
[15:32:16] <shoky> otherwise, just use Image objects
[15:32:47] <shoky> Wilornel: when you plan to show a lot of photos and dont want to wait in the middle of the slideshow for a load of the next pic
[15:33:03] <shoky> so you.. pre-load
[15:33:23] <Wilornel> oohh okay
[15:33:33] <Wilornel> Nice! :P
[15:33:39] <Wilornel> Oh guys
[15:33:48] <Wilornel> does .each() work with variables?
[15:33:52] <shoky> did you try?
[15:33:56] <shoky> did you read?
[15:34:25] <Wilornel> I
[15:35:07] <Wilornel> executing a function for each matched element
[15:35:09] <Wilornel> elements
[15:35:15] <Wilornel> That's not variables...
[15:35:19] <Wilornel> So I guess you cannot?
[15:35:48] <ajpiano> Wilornel: everything you can do in javascript, you can "do with variables"
[15:35:59] <sidc> live works
[15:36:01] <shoky> Wilornel see ?$.each
[15:36:02] <bot-t> shoky, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:36:08] <shoky> derp
[15:36:12] <Wilornel> element!
[15:36:13] <shoky> ?jQuery.each
[15:36:13] <bot-t> jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[15:36:16] <shoky> that one^^
[15:36:22] <Wilornel> oh
[15:36:23] <Wilornel> array
[15:36:26] <Wilornel> Ok cool
[15:36:40] <sidc> creativecag: live works but now evey time i open the popup it executes the click even an extra time for each time i open the dialog
[15:36:58] <shoky> sup ajpiano
[15:37:13] <ajpiano> workin, just foolishly poking my head in :p
[15:37:24] <shoky> ;]
[15:37:41] <sidc> ajpiano: is there an unbind with live()?
[15:37:46] <ajpiano> ?die
[15:37:47] <bot-t> .die(): Remove all event handlers previously attached using .live() from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/die/
[15:37:56] <Wilornel> Woaw
[15:38:10] <shoky> deth
[15:38:11] <Wilornel> For how long you guys have been using jquery/ coding?
[15:38:19] <sidc> ok thanks
[15:38:19] <shoky> um
[15:38:42] <shoky> jquery maybe 6 months. coding since i was 8 ;s
[15:38:49] <Wilornel> seriously??
[15:39:02] <shoky> yas?!?!
[15:39:22] <Wilornel> Wow
[15:39:43] <shoky> whatz the wow
[15:40:09] <shoky> everyone's got hobbies
[15:44:33] <Wilornel> true
[15:44:41] <Wilornel> I gamed at this age....
[15:44:49] <joobie> hey guys.. anyone know how to display items in the "add new record" dialog box within jqgrid?
[15:44:57] <joobie> i can get it popping up, but no items appear
[15:48:10] <JAAulde> What up, my homies?
[15:48:12] <teetimus> when i use find() to select multiple elements from a table using an each loop they are placed in a single string but i need them to be separate
[15:48:17] <teetimus> how can i do that?
[15:48:52] <teetimus> $(this).find(span,div)   returns one string :(
[15:51:29] <JAAulde> teetimus: `$(this).find(span,div)` doesn't return a string. anyway, make a JSFiddle example of how you are currently doing it, and explain what you really want
[15:51:38] <JAAulde> ?JSFiddle @teetimus
[15:51:38] <bot-t> teetimus, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[15:54:17] * JAAulde sings "Hello again to all my friends, together we can play some rock and roll." and does a little dubstep
[15:56:53] <teetimus> JAAulde, http://jsfiddle.net/x8Fbj/1/
[15:57:08] <JAAulde> teetimus: taking a look
[15:57:12] <teetimus> its actually $(this).find(span,div) .text()
[15:57:40] <JAAulde> right, got ya
[15:57:42] <teetimus> i am try to print the text in a column but separately based on the class
[15:57:48] <teetimus> trying*
[15:58:05] <gnarf> teetimus: $(this).find("span,div").map( function() { return $(this).text(); } ).get()
[15:58:14] <JAAulde> ok, so .text() takes the text of all elements in the collection (and their children) and concats it
[15:58:52] <JAAulde> teetimus: as gnarf has shown, you need to use one of the collection iterating methods to hit each element individually (.map, .each, etc)
[15:59:15] <teetimus> i am using each()
[15:59:41] <teetimus> oh
[15:59:53] <sidc> ajpiano: can you do live('show', function() {});
[15:59:54] <teetimus> an each() with an each()?
[15:59:57] <teetimus> within..
[16:00:03] <sidc> or does that not work?
[16:00:36] <JAAulde> teetimus: you're eaching the results of 'table.bfmTbl', but not the results of the inner find. yes, you can each within an each
[16:05:40] <JAAulde> teetimus: http://jsfiddle.net/JAAulde/x8Fbj/2/
[16:05:52] <teetimus> i got it to work
[16:05:58] <JAAulde> cool
[16:06:37] <teetimus> thnx guys. and ill try your paste JAAulde
[16:06:47] <JAAulde> teetimus: no prob
[16:06:51] <JAAulde> i'm outty
[16:12:44] <sidc> how do u unload what was loaded using load()
[16:12:57] <shoky> .html('')
[16:13:44] <shoky> or .empty() i guess
[16:18:49] <Whirl3d> anybody got a suggestion for windows 7 local test server? XAMP and WAMP both suck ass, any others?
[16:19:18] <ColKurtz> install an apache PHP stack yourself?
[16:19:51] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I'll prolly piece together apache, mysql, php myself locally. bah
[16:19:55] <ColKurtz> what's so bad about WAMP or XAMP?
[16:20:07] <ColKurtz> WAMP works great for me.
[16:21:07] <Whirl3d> Xamp's windows download is broken and I just uninstalled WAMP after fighting for an hour with it because it couldn't alias a project folder because I did a non-standard install (I don't like shit installed on c:/)
[16:21:41] <shoky> hmm
[16:21:47] <shoky> virtualbox ;S
[16:22:35] <Whirl3d> I'm half tempted to use dropBox, lol
[16:22:44] <shoky> lolwat
[16:22:57] <shoky> srsly why not just virtualbox ;P
[16:23:06] <Whirl3d> lookin' it up now
[16:23:08] <shoky> oh
[16:23:13] <shoky> its like vmware
[16:23:18] <shoky> virtual pc
[16:23:26] <shoky> just run linux ;p
[16:25:01] <Wilornel> Guys, what am I doing wrong?
[16:25:02] <Wilornel> https://gist.github.com/2474419
[16:25:29] <Wilornel> I try to assign a value to an array, but I get the error: Cannot set property '0' of undefined
[16:25:57] <shoky> Wilornel: var secondArray;
[16:26:01] <shoky> secondArray is undefined
[16:26:07] <shoky> then you're doing secondArray[index] ...
[16:26:18] <Wilornel> well
[16:26:21] <shoky> try var secondArray = [];
[16:27:12] <Wilornel> Looks like it works ! :D
[16:27:16] <shoky> ;D
[16:27:24] <Wilornel> but now...
[16:27:27] <shoky> understood what the prob was?
[16:27:30] <Wilornel> yeah
[16:27:33] <shoky> cool
[16:27:35] <Wilornel> The variable was not an array
[16:27:39] <Wilornel> right?
[16:27:46] <shoky> it was undefined, yeah
[16:28:31] <Wilornel> ok so now. If I do console.log(secondArray[0]); , I will get something like {+id:+'0',+user:+'bob' }
[16:28:48] <Wilornel> But If I do secondArray[0]['user'], it does not work
[16:29:04] <Wilornel> it says: undefined
[16:29:09] <shoky> why should it
[16:29:16] <Wilornel> uhm
[16:29:20] <Wilornel> Why it should work?
[16:29:22] <shoky> dude. be more precise. enough with 'something like'
[16:29:58] <Wilornel> ok so now. If I do console.log(secondArray[0]); , I will get {+id:+'0',+user:+'bob'+}
[16:30:08] <shoky> as a string?
[16:30:12] <Wilornel> yes
[16:30:16] <Wilornel> it will be a string
[16:30:22] <shoky> so its a string. you cant do ['user'] on a string
[16:30:28] <Wilornel> :O
[16:30:38] <Wilornel> wait...
[16:30:39] <shoky> well maybe you can. but thats not what you want
[16:30:47] <Wilornel> Then how can I pass an array using ajax??
[16:31:14] <shoky> you can $.parseJSON  if you had a JSON string
[16:31:21] <Wilornel> I thought of doing this on server side: echo "{ id: '$id', user:'$user' }
[16:31:30] <shoky> i don't know what  {+id:+'0',+user:+'bob'+}   is supposed to be though
[16:32:26] <Wilornel> webdeveloper.com "send variables through ajax"
[16:33:18] <Wilornel> Wow
[16:33:19] <Wilornel> Sorry
[16:38:42] <Wilornel> How can I send an array through ajax??
[16:39:17] <shoky> you have your server output a JSON string representing an array
[16:39:29] <Wilornel> yeah
[16:39:32] <shoky> like "['wow':'cow']"
[16:39:32] <innociv> So I was wondering... localStorage limit is per domain, right?  So I can have 0.storage.domain.com 1.storage.domain.com hub.storage.domain.com and hub stores a list to sort the data from the other localSTorages?
[16:39:39] <Wilornel> Ihave to "eval" it
[16:39:46] <shoky> don't eval anything
[16:39:56] <innociv> That's an object not array.
[16:40:09] <Wilornel> So I need JSON to decode it?
[16:40:19] <shoky> Wilornel: $.parseJSON parses JSON
[16:40:53] <Wilornel> OHHH OKAY
[16:41:07] <Wilornel> So I transform the string into a javascript object
[16:41:12] <Wilornel> then I can manipulate it
[16:41:30] <shoky> jquery transforms it, yes
[16:41:58] <Wilornel> yeah jquery does all the hard work
[16:42:23] <shoky> technically not really ;P
[16:42:26] <shoky> but yeah.
[16:44:07] <Wilornel> Why the hell would I have an unexpected token +???
[16:44:26] <Wilornel> respObj = eval("(" +secondArray2[index] +")");
[16:44:44] <shoky> you dont listen huh
[16:45:09] <Wilornel> ok sorry
[16:45:16] <Wilornel> I just deleted that line
[16:45:27] <Wilornel> Now I can manipulate the object
[16:45:34] <shoky> you said you have pluses+ in your string, i dunno
[16:45:53] <Wilornel> that what is the JSON string
[16:45:59] <Wilornel> ok so wait
[16:46:45] <Wilornel> https://gist.github.com/2474419
[16:46:47] <Wilornel> Updated
[16:47:05] <Wilornel> There should not be any string, only javascript object
[16:47:29] <Wilornel> When I do the console.log, it says: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token +   jquery.js:564
[16:48:39] <catcher> Wilornel, parjeJSON?
[16:49:41] <Wilornel> GOD!
[16:50:05] <xmaddness> yes?
[16:50:39] <shoky> unghhhhh
[16:50:39] <Wilornel> xmaddness: lol
[16:50:46] <Wilornel> shoky: still same thing...
[16:51:10] <shoky> what do you want me to do about it?
[16:51:29] <beancurd> fix it fix it fix it fix it
[16:51:41] <Wilornel> but
[16:51:51] <xmaddness> damn netsplits
[16:51:56] <Wilornel> I do not understand what to do
[16:52:02] <beancurd> http://emotibot.net/pix/1274.jpg
[16:52:35] <shoky> Wilornel how about properly explaining the problem , not just half sentences and 'buts' and 'still same thing' <-- how the hell are we supposed to know what you're referring to?
[16:52:38] <shoky> THINK
[16:52:42] <shoky> then talk
[16:52:50] <shoky> we'll gladly help
[16:53:30] <xmaddness> see if you can reproduce the problem on jsfiddle
[16:58:16] <Wilornel> In order to parse something, looks like there should not be any +
[16:58:33] <bricker88> Hello… I have a document element and want to find run jquery methods on it, but it's telling me stuff like Object [object HTMLDocument] has no method 'find'… how can I turn it into a jquery object?
[16:59:29] <shoky> Wilornel that string with pluses that you showed is not proper JSON. those pluses are illegal
[16:59:52] <Wilornel> yeah That's what I found out. I am trying to find a way to replace them with spaces
[16:59:56] <shoky> Wilornel why are you calling that decodeURIComponent ?
[17:00:19] <shoky> if you just console.log(value)  what do you get
[17:00:30] <Wilornel> because in "somefile.php" i did an urlencode()
[17:00:38] <shoky> why?
[17:00:57] <Wilornel> Well...
[17:01:06] <Wilornel> Because I had to split in the main webpage
[17:01:19] <Wilornel> So in the somefile.php I divided them by #
[17:01:41] <Wilornel> looks like I should just restrict the users from typings this characters in the description and all should be good...
[17:01:54] <Wilornel> Now I have to deal with pluses and that's even worse...
[17:02:26] <Wilornel> Ok thanks alot shoky, I know what to do now, I'll try to fix it and I'll come back
[17:02:30] <Wilornel> Thanks again :P
[17:02:37] <shoky> np
[17:04:51] <shoky> bricker88: $( yourElement )
[17:06:24] <callen> is anyone aware of any good widgets with locked sliders?
[17:06:37] <shoky> locked?
[17:06:53] <bricker88> shoky: indeed, thanks!
[17:07:01] <callen> I found one, but it was awful.
[17:07:07] <callen> shoky: imagine if you will, that you have three slider bars
[17:07:15] <shoky> oh, that slide to unlock crap?
[17:07:16] <callen> shoky: they need to total 100, in all.
[17:07:18] <callen> shoky: no!
[17:07:18] <shoky> erm
[17:07:20] <shoky> ok
[17:07:21] <callen> shoky: like an EQ
[17:07:33] <callen> shoky: but they have to be locked to a total of 100, and each slider has a range of 0-100
[17:07:43] <callen> so they have to rebalance each time one of their brethren changes :)
[17:07:57] <callen> I found one such widget built on jQuery UI, but it was awful and buggy.
[17:07:59] <shoky> so why not jqueryui slider
[17:08:05] <shoky> works fine for me
[17:08:26] <callen> it doesn't have locking.
[17:08:50] <shoky> that's very simple to do..
[17:09:26] <callen> I think you'll find that writing a bug-free balancer is trickier than you think.
[17:09:32] <shoky> i don't think you'll find a slider widget that happens to have functionality for changing its value based on a bunch of other sliders
[17:09:37] <callen> you have to do a bunch of bounds checking.
[17:09:45] <callen> there *was* one, but it was buggy.
[17:09:48] <callen> that's my point.
[17:09:51] <shoky> it seems utterly simple to me..
[17:10:00] <callen> shoky: then hit up jsfiddle and do it.
[17:10:07] <shoky> aight ;)
[17:10:07] <callen> if you think it's so easy.
[17:10:17] <shoky> i do, i may be wrong ;)
[17:10:19] <callen> I'm in the middle of JS Hell trying to make one that doesn't have pathological behavior.
[17:12:02] * xmaddness lives in js hell all day long
[17:12:32] <callen> shoky: you do realize what I'm saying right?
[17:12:40] <callen> shoky: I'm not saying they're locked to the same values or differences of each other
[17:12:57] <callen> shoky: I'm saying they're locked to a given total, and that you have to dynamically rebalance them without creating invalid totals or individual values.
[17:13:17] <callen> such that they would equal 33 - 33 - 34, but if you increased 34 to 50, the other two would decrease to bring the total to 100 again.
[17:14:01] <shoky> yea gotcha ;p
[17:17:19] <xmaddness> sounds like just a little math trickery to me
[17:18:17] <callen> the math is the easy part
[17:18:23] <callen> catching the pathological cases is the hard part.
[17:18:28] <callen> well "hard"
[17:18:30] <callen> more like irritating
[17:18:34] <callen> you have to be thorough.
[17:18:55] <xmaddness> Well, how many sliders do you have?
[17:19:13] <nishttal2> i am using the autocomplete dropdown and having problems getting the onchange event.. can someone please help
[17:19:31] <xmaddness> Just create a slider object, and give it a currentVal and a maxAvailable val
[17:20:11] <callen> xmaddness: three
[17:20:27] <callen> xmaddness: I have access to those values, it's not that simple.
[17:20:46] <xmaddness> well the rest is just implementation
[17:21:04] <callen> ...
[17:22:47] <xmaddness> The way I would do it it to cause the slider to only be increased by what is available. Set its max possible value to be whatever is left. Make it so none can be slid up unless this number is > 0
[17:23:09] <xmaddness> On slide up to available, trigger the updated number available
[17:23:30] <xmaddness> make it so that is its all maxed out, none can be increased
[17:23:41] <xmaddness> Once the decrease one, it become part of available
[17:23:42] <callen> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5ZLL/826/
[17:24:59] <catcher> is there something like find() that will match elements that are lower in the DOM but aren't descendants?
[17:25:32] <xmaddness> thata selector or a method?
[17:25:39] <callen> catcher: _.filter out the children?
[17:25:46] <callen> out of the results of find, that is.
[17:26:01] <catcher> callen, the find() won't find it, as I'm trying to find something that isn't a descendant.
[17:26:14] <ngharo> ?siblings
[17:26:14] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[17:26:24] <justinhjohnson> ?closest
[17:26:25] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[17:26:34] <catcher> it's unfortunately not a sibling either.
[17:27:02] <callen> catcher: so you just need to select for it?
[17:27:17] <catcher> and closest() goes up...
[17:27:21] <catcher> hang on, example coming up
[17:28:58] <catcher> http://jsfiddle.net/mEBCn/
[17:29:22] <catcher> I should've used class instead of ID, these are dynamically generated and repeated.
[17:30:15] <catcher> the button needs to toggle the very next div called "forToggle", but not the rest (there are many more below)
[17:30:18] * callen eye twitches
[17:30:38] <coslo> hi can you tell me how to add an element to an accordion?
[17:30:45] <philaneous> hi I'm having trouble with a query
[17:30:57] <xmaddness> See I would have approached this differently
[17:30:58] <philaneous> i would appreciate if someone could give me some pointers
[17:31:27] <coslo> i tried this:
[17:31:38] <coslo> $('#accordion').append('<div> <h3><a href="#">blah</a></h3> <div>text</div> </div>').accordion('destroy').accordion();
[17:31:46] <coslo> but the problem is it messes up the css for some reason
[17:31:53] <catcher> I guess I'll be using some parent() calls..
[17:31:54] <coslo> text gets shifted into the wrong shelves etc
[17:32:19] <coslo> do you have any idea how this is possible? i googled and found differnt suggestions, tried them, most often found the suggstion i pasted and it does not work
[17:32:26] <justinhjohnson> catcher, why don't you just use a class selector?
[17:32:36] <philaneous> catcher: whats up
[17:32:38] <justinhjohnson> if you're dynamically generating the classes, tag the button and the div with the same class
[17:32:47] <justinhjohnson> or a data attr
[17:32:52] <coslo> or any idea what i am doing wrong?
[17:32:55] <philaneous> catcher: remember helping me with that api
[17:32:59] <catcher> hey philaneous, sure do
[17:33:11] <philaneous> hey I was wondering if u might have insight
[17:33:23] <philaneous> why my flickr api only gives me results on a monday
[17:33:31] <philaneous> when i query a search
[17:33:57] <catcher> philaneous, it only gives you results *on* monday or *from* monday?
[17:34:15] <philaneous> from
[17:34:20] <catcher> justinhjohnson, because selectors are rad
[17:34:32] <ML74> how can i count the number of li elements in a <ul> using query?
[17:34:34] <ML74> **jquery
[17:34:41] <philaneous> any query i search i get results from images that were taken on a mondayh
[17:34:46] <philaneous> or uploaded
[17:34:49] <philaneous> on a monday'
[17:35:10] <catcher> ML74, $('ul.yourClass li').length
[17:35:19] <xmaddness> ML74 yeah what he said
[17:35:26] <xmaddness> beat me to it
[17:35:28] <xmaddness> :P
[17:35:41] <philaneous> catcher: http://sulley.dm.ucf.edu/~ph713302/dig4503/semesterProject/
[17:35:45] <catcher> philaneous, odds are you're querying the API for a specific date..
[17:35:59] <philaneous> i was but i took the unix date stamp off
[17:36:04] <philaneous> my get thumbs php
[17:36:13] <philaneous> so it would produce any result
[17:37:17] <catcher> philaneous, getThumbs.php says you're not passing any parameters to the API.
[17:38:09] <philaneous> so hows it searching then?
[17:38:55] <catcher> philaneous, can you post a working model of the problem to jsfiddle?
[17:39:06] <philaneous> sure
[17:44:46] <philaneous> http://jsfiddle.net/ZexxY/
[17:44:47] <philaneous> catcher
[17:44:52] <philaneous> i can't upload the php files
[17:44:54] <philaneous> how do i do that
[17:45:47] <philaneous> catcher:
[17:47:08] <catcher> philaneous, no need - these results are coming from the espn api, there's nothing in your getThumbs.php
[17:47:18] <philaneous> i know
[17:47:21] <philaneous> because I'm using
[17:47:22] <philaneous> 2 apis
[17:47:28] <philaneous> the espn api is fine
[17:47:31] <catcher> kk
[17:47:33] <philaneous> its giving out the headlines
[17:47:45] <philaneous> but the flickr api
[17:47:57] <philaneous> is what is using the getThumbs
[17:48:05] <philaneous> and get photo
[17:48:07] <catcher> philaneous, you're not getting any data from your getThumbs though, you're seeing the alt text from the html.
[17:48:31] <philaneous> post a query on the search
[17:49:06] <catcher> the api can't use your php, it's the other way around..
[17:49:35] <catcher> so what you need to do is have your PHP make a REST call to the flickr api, and then you can query your php via ajax.
[17:49:53] <catcher> looks like flickr doesn't accept a json call but can return json data, so this is probably your best bet.
[17:50:14] <philaneous> well what do i change for it not to give out pictures on a monday
[17:50:19] <philaneous> right now thats all its doing
[17:50:39] <catcher> philaneous, where do you see results from a monday?
[17:50:47] <philaneous> thats what I'm trying to explain to you
[17:50:48] <philaneous> it works
[17:50:50] <philaneous> right now
[17:50:52] <philaneous> go here
[17:50:58] <philaneous> http://sulley.dm.ucf.edu/~ph713302/dig4503/semesterProject/home.html
[17:51:04] <philaneous> scroll
[17:51:05] <philaneous> down
[17:51:10] <philaneous> and then type basketball
[17:51:24] <philaneous> the date is may21st
[17:52:08] <philaneous> all the pictures you click on are uploaded on a monday
[17:52:51] <philaneous> do you see what I'm saying
[17:53:30] <xmaddness> not all of them
[17:54:06] <xmaddness> I se a lot of them from the 23rd
[17:54:09] <shoky> callen: not done yet but this is what i got so far :P http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/N63wV/4/
[17:54:50] <xmaddness> I love sliders that increase them selves automatically
[17:54:55] <catcher> philaneous, you're getting responses from 4/22 and 4/23
[17:55:02] <xmaddness> makes it so easy to fine tune them to what I want
[17:55:03] <xmaddness> :P
[17:55:25] <catcher> and 4/21
[17:55:27] <xmaddness> there are some from 4/21 also
[17:55:38] <xmaddness> 02/2011
[17:55:39] <catcher> ha
[17:55:46] <xmaddness> erm
[17:55:50] <xmaddness> 2/11
[17:55:51] <philaneous> but they're all on monday
[17:56:06] <philaneous> 4/21?
[17:56:09] <philaneous> what did u search
[17:56:13] <philaneous> xmaddness?
[17:56:13] <shoky> callen: ok its not UTTERLY simple. takes some work, but you get there in the end :P
[17:56:17] <xmaddness> basketball
[17:56:40] <catcher> philaneous, <photo id="6961631974" ... datetaken="2012-04-22 14:51:21" datetakengranularity="0" />
[17:57:24] <philaneous> catcher:  huh
[17:57:28] <xmaddness> Are those sliders intended to adjust themselves as one is changed? What if I don't want one increased when I decrease the other?
[17:57:41] <philaneous> u got one without that date
[17:57:56] <xmaddness> <photo id="7104227655" owner="58062355@N06" secret="f88c4e6b37" server="8149" farm="9" title="DSCN0566" ispublic="1" isfriend="0" isfamily="0" datetaken="2012-04-21 13:41:13" datetakengranularity="0" />
[17:57:57] <catcher> philaneous, yeah, you're getting lots back, with several dates
[17:58:17] <philaneous> all I'm seeing is mondays
[17:58:17] <xmaddness> <photo id="7105387077" owner="46694135@N06" secret="8232c16ddf" server="8155" farm="9" title="DSC_0862" ispublic="1" isfriend="0" isfamily="0" datetaken="2012-04-23 12:03:45" datetakengranularity="0" />
[17:58:18] <philaneous> man
[17:58:18] <catcher> philaneous, flickr api gives back 100 by default, maybe you're only displaying a few.
[17:59:33] <philaneous> dude every picture i click and look up the date
[17:59:36] <philaneous> its on a monday lol
[17:59:36] <coslo> hi guys can you tell me how to add an element to an accordion?
[17:59:39] <coslo> i tried this:
[17:59:42] <coslo> $('#accordion').append('<div> <h3><a href="#">blah</a></h3> <div>text</div> </div>').accordion('destroy').accordion();
[17:59:46] <coslo> but the problem is it messes up the css for some reason
[17:59:50] <coslo> text gets shifted into the wrong shelves etc
[17:59:59] <coslo> i googled and found differnt suggestions, tried them, most often found the suggstion i pasted and it does not work
[18:00:10] <catcher> philaneous, it's possible the date taken is different from the date uploaded too
[18:00:14] <coslo> can you help me?
[18:00:56] <philaneous> catcher: i search in flickr basketball
[18:01:03] <philaneous> i get different results with different dates
[18:01:04] <philaneous> on mine
[18:01:06] <philaneous> i get mondays lol
[18:01:08] <philaneous> w/eeee
[18:01:56] <catcher> philaneous, I'm looking at what flickr is giving you back on your site, and it includes many dates.
[18:02:11] <catcher> promise
[18:02:18] <xmaddness> philaneous: same here
[18:02:32] <xmaddness> I 'm looking directly at the response from the api
[18:02:53] <philaneous> noooo
[18:02:56] <philaneous> u guys don't get what I'm saying
[18:03:07] <philaneous> it only returns pictures taken on mondays from different months LOL!!!
[18:03:15] <philaneous> so like may 21
[18:03:24] <philaneous> november 21
[18:03:35] <philaneous> u see what I'm saying
[18:03:35] <philaneous> guys
[18:03:58] <catcher> philaneous, 4/21, 4/22, 4/23
[18:04:09] <catcher> philaneous, just seems to be the most recent 100
[18:04:19] <philaneous> ok what did u type to get 4/21
[18:04:22] <philaneous> i wanna see this
[18:04:30] <catcher> debug console, look at XHR response
[18:04:31] <xmaddness> philaneous: 1 sec incoming
[18:10:06] <catcher> gotta roll y'all..
[18:11:24] <xmaddness> philaneous http://screencast.com/t/pYJfuhmkR
[18:11:44] <coslo> hey i am using this function call:
[18:11:55] <coslo> $.get(url, function(data){ $(data).appendTo("#element"); });
[18:12:10] <coslo> the url returns a string 'Hello World!<br><br>'
[18:12:23] <coslo> but this string is not added to #element, only a single '<br>'
[18:12:23] <philaneous> xmaddness: ok thanks
[18:12:25] <coslo> do yuou know why?
[18:12:51] <coslo> can you read my words btw?
[18:12:53] <coslo> or am i muted
[18:12:59] <callen> shoky: I think I like yours better than mine, not sure.
[18:12:59] <coslo> can somebody pls highlight my name?
[18:13:25] <philaneous> xmaddness: well i guess its filtering
[18:13:29] <coslo> hi philaneous
[18:13:38] <philaneous> sup
[18:13:41] <coslo> i feel like i am a ghost :(
[18:13:47] <coslo> can anybody help me a bit?
[18:13:48] <philaneous> lol
[18:13:49] <catcher> philaneous, I suspect this is your issue: if(intervalDate.getDay() == 1 && countPhoto < 40) {
[18:14:01] <coslo> i dont understand this behavior
[18:14:03] <xmaddness> anyone else getting this weird feeling?
[18:14:15] <xmaddness> like, the channel is being watched or something?
[18:14:18] <coslo> i console.log(date)'ed it and it shows  the right string
[18:14:25] <coslo> but for some reason it only appends '<br>'
[18:14:37] <coslo> xmaddness: what do you mean, watched?
[18:14:38] <philaneous> catcher: what do i change that to?
[18:14:45] <philaneous> I'm watching right now
[18:14:53] <catcher> philaneous, well it depends on what you want it to do..
[18:15:03] <ngharo> coslo: thats odd.  try $('#element').append(data); for kicks
[18:15:11] <philaneous> i just want it to show all pictures
[18:15:12] <philaneous> man
[18:15:24] <catcher> then get rid of the if altogether :-P
[18:15:29] <catcher> and the closing brace
[18:15:32] <coslo> ngharo: i find that on google and tried exactly that and i got the same result :|
[18:15:38] <coslo> thanks for helping btw
[18:15:51] <catcher> philaneous, that'll fix it
[18:15:59] <catcher> really gotta roll, gl
[18:16:17] <ngharo> coslo: sounds like you're returning malformed html
[18:16:23] <coslo> is the data automatically filtered or someting?
[18:16:30] <callen> shoky: yeah, I definitely like yours better than mine, thank you so much for hacking that up!
[18:16:33] <philaneous> sorry coslo
[18:16:37] <philaneous> i don't know how to help you
[18:16:40] <coslo> ngharo: actually i just wrote a php file containing 'Hello World!<br><br>'
[18:16:49] <coslo> ngharo: and then i pointed the url to that file
[18:16:59] <coslo> ok np philaneous
[18:17:07] <ngharo> try <br/>'s
[18:17:11] <coslo> oh ok ngharo
[18:17:39] <callen> shoky: nice mutex :P
[18:17:45] <shoky> callen i think i got a nice solution. some would say its inefficient but screw them, 1 sec ;)
[18:17:53] <shoky> heh thx
[18:17:55] <callen> shoky: nah I love it man!
[18:18:00] <philaneous> haha
[18:18:03] <philaneous> i fixed it
[18:18:05] <callen> shoky: the use of a mutex is a brilliant way to create exclusive rebalancing behavior.
[18:18:08] <philaneous> xxmaddness
[18:18:13] <philaneous> i know whats wrong man
[18:18:16] <xmaddness> philaneous
[18:18:24] <coslo> damn this is weird, same behavior
[18:18:27] <shoky> callen: :)
[18:18:30] <philaneous> xmaddness: if i fuck with the count
[18:18:31] <xmaddness> oh? It is probably in the php
[18:18:33] <philaneous> in the JS file
[18:18:37] <coslo> i am using <!DOCTYPE html> btw so <br> should work
[18:18:40] <philaneous> it changes my results
[18:22:32] <coslo> oh it was just a color issue
[18:22:43] <coslo> for some reason it didnt assume the same color as the text that was already there
[18:22:48] <coslo> it used the background color automatically
[18:22:50] <coslo> weird shit
[18:22:59] <coslo> it adjusted to different background colors
[18:23:05] <xmaddness> its innefficient
[18:23:08] <xmaddness> :P
[18:23:10] <xmaddness> jk
[18:24:08] <coslo> why the fuck does it do that?
[18:24:21] <coslo> it uses the background color for text, how stupid is that?
[18:25:02] <ngharo> ask your stylesheet bro
[18:25:04] <coslo> oh sorry i was wrong
[18:25:11] <beancurd> validate your css.
[18:25:29] <beancurd> missing } or ; probably.
[18:25:37] <coslo> actually i added a <span style="color:foo">Hello World!</span><br><br> and then it worked but NOT because of the color but because of the SPAN
[18:25:58] <coslo> so this is weird, apparently it wants the string to start with a <tag>
[18:26:06] <coslo> otherwise it just removes the text
[18:26:10] <coslo> is this a bug?
[18:26:40] <coslo> i tried leaving the color out and it still works with a simple <span>Text</span><br><br>
[18:26:48] <coslo> probably a bug
[18:26:59] <Bankzilla> whats your code?
[18:28:06] <coslo> $.get(url, function(data){$('#element').append(data)});
[18:28:23] <ngharo> sounds like css problems
[18:28:40] <coslo> ngharo: no i looked in the chrome inspector and there was only a <br> in the dom
[18:28:47] <ngharo> ?demo
[18:28:48] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:28:53] <coslo> and if i highlighted it there was no text ngharo
[18:28:59] <coslo> ok let me try that

[18:29:21] <whoisthis> http://jsfiddle.net/MjQKA/
[18:29:21] <Bankzilla> ill brb, mock up a jsfiddle an i'll overlook it if you can replicate the error
[18:29:33] <whoisthis> I'm actually trying to make something more complicated, but I can't get resizable to work at all :(
[18:29:42] <shoky> callen: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/N63wV/8/
[18:30:19] <Getty> is there any statistics about how many first time javascript users use jquery? (or anything related to javascript newcomers and jquery)
[18:31:12] <coslo> ngharo: err i cannot create ajax calls there
[18:31:48] <shoky> callen: a bit cleaner: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/N63wV/10/
[18:32:31] <ngharo> whoisthis: add the css -- http://jsfiddle.net/MjQKA/1/
[18:33:40] <whoisthis> hmm
[18:33:46] <whoisthis> thanks, but wait a second
[18:33:54] <whoisthis> it's not everything :)

[18:38:40] <xmaddness> okay, no set those sliders to the following config. 9, 13, 21, 4, 9, 12, 9, 13
[18:38:41] <whoisthis> basically, I want #handle to be the handle
[18:38:45] <xmaddness> s/no/now
[18:38:52] <xmaddness> gl
[18:39:23] <xmaddness> :P
[18:39:29] <shoky> :P
[18:39:35] <shoky> hey i didnt design the thing!
[18:39:40] <xmaddness> lol
[18:39:48] <xmaddness> Its good though
[18:39:52] <shoky> ;)
[18:39:56] <xmaddness> it does what he was after
[18:40:02] <shoky> aye
[18:40:08] <xmaddness> but, question is is he after the right thing :P
[18:40:18] <shoky> yep ;P
[18:41:55] <whoisthis> I'm wondering if maybe switch from jquery-ui to interface library
[18:42:09] <whoisthis> (I don't use other jquery ui things anyway)
[18:43:50] <xmaddness> I used the accordion once, but I hacked it out
[18:43:57] <xmaddness> I tend to just do everyting custom
[18:44:11] <xmaddness> well, the suff I get paid to do that is
[18:44:14] <xmaddness> :P
[18:44:24] <shoky> custom from scratch?
[18:44:33] <xmaddness> using base jquery
[18:44:40] <shoky> kool
[18:44:43] <xmaddness> all plugins
[18:44:46] <xmaddness> lots of em
[18:44:57] <xmaddness> currently the codebase for the js alone is at about 77k lines
[18:45:11] <xmaddness> pre minified of course
[18:45:24] <shoky> any public?
[18:45:29] <xmaddness> not yet
[18:45:33] <xmaddness> but it will be soon
[18:45:36] <shoky> kool kool
[18:46:11] <xmaddness> if your in the us you will probably hear about it :)
[18:46:22] <xmaddness> Unfortunaletly I can't say more than that though
[18:46:52] <shoky> i'm not ;)
[18:47:07] <xmaddness> lol then you might still
[18:47:11] <shoky> ;p
[18:47:16] <xmaddness> not sure how much they advertise overseas
[18:47:38] <shoky> i avoid ads like the plague
[18:47:43] <shoky> in any media
[18:48:23] <dimez> any jquery / wordpress ninjas in here for hire?

[18:52:27] <shoky> iz it w0rking??
[18:52:31] <Wilornel> changed*
[18:52:35] <shoky> pluses???
[18:52:41] <Wilornel> Uhm well a part of it
[18:52:53] <shoky> pluses stink man
[18:53:01] <Wilornel> Wait
[18:53:05] <Wilornel> there are no more pluses
[18:53:08] <Wilornel> only spaces :P
[18:53:09] <shoky> YAY
[18:53:12] <Wilornel> yeah
[18:54:02] <Wilornel> Ok so now, I do var secondArray = $.parseJSON(firstArray[index]); console.log(secondArray.itemname);
[18:54:23] <Wilornel> the console.log will only write: $itemname....
[18:54:36] <shoky> Huh
[18:54:46] <shoky> what does it say when you console.log(secondArray)
[18:55:01] <shoky> or console.log(firstArray[index])
[18:55:29] <Wilornel> when I do console.log(secondArray) it outputs: object -> And then you have all the variables
[18:55:41] <shoky> properties
[18:55:42] <Wilornel> like a dropdown
[18:55:44] <Wilornel> yeah
[18:55:47] <shoky> whut
[18:55:48] <Wilornel> exactly, properties
[18:55:55] <shoky> does it have itemname ?
[18:55:56] <Wilornel> im on chrome
[18:55:59] <Wilornel> sec
[18:56:01] <xmaddness> attributes*
[18:56:04] <xmaddness> :P
[18:56:04] <Wilornel> yeah
[18:56:06] <whoisthis> hmm, no way interface library will do it
[18:56:09] <Wilornel> waiitt
[18:56:11] <shoky> naw, properties
[18:56:11] <whoisthis> no alsoResize, for once
[18:56:15] <Wilornel> ok I think I found the problem
[18:56:15] <shoky> attributes is html plz
[18:56:16] <Wilornel> wait
[18:56:18] <xmaddness> lol I know
[18:56:27] <xmaddness> its still an object
[18:56:35] <xmaddness> Im jk though
[18:56:37] <xmaddness> I use both
[18:56:43] <whoisthis> http://jsfiddle.net/MjQKA/3/
[18:56:49] <shoky> WELlllllllll javascript objects have properties not attributes ;p
[18:56:54] <xmaddness> heh
[18:56:56] <whoisthis> any help on this still appreciated - i want #handle to be a handle
[18:57:19] <shoky> whoisthis, what?
[18:57:22] <shoky> who??
[18:57:27] <ngharo> whoisthis: see the 'handles' option in the docs.  It seems to explain how to do it.
[18:57:35] <shoky> oh there was a fiddle
[18:58:02] <whoisthis> hmm, I think I already tried handles
[18:58:06] <whoisthis> but maybe I did something wrong
[18:58:12] <Wilornel> Aighhtttt thanks alot shoky! :P
[18:58:14] <whoisthis> http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/post/426818005/jquery-ui-resizable-custom-handle-syntax found this, let me try
[18:59:09] <shoky> lol wat did i do
[18:59:37] <Wilornel> You made me realise that my properties had only $variable as variables, no strings
[18:59:44] <Wilornel> I messed up in my php so yeah
[18:59:49] <Wilornel> thanks a ton! :P
[18:59:52] <shoky> Wilornel pleaaaaaaase take a good look at this, even if you've watched it before:
[18:59:56] <shoky> ?ftj @ Wilornel
[18:59:57] <bot-t> Wilornel, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[19:00:15] <Wilornel> Oh cool
[19:00:17] <Wilornel> never saw it
[19:00:21] <shoky> cool :)
[19:00:21] <Wilornel> I'll take a look
[19:00:23] <Wilornel> anyways thanks :P
[19:00:27] <shoky> it's worth your time
[19:00:31] <shoky> np
[19:00:37] <xmaddness> http://jsfiddle.net/MjQKA/3/  <-- this?
[19:01:13] <whoisthis> hmm, seems to work
[19:01:20] <whoisthis> I must've did something stupid, oh well :)
[19:01:25] <whoisthis> s/did/done
[19:03:33] <shoky> huh
[19:03:50] <shoky> the pink block is supposed to be a resize handle?
[19:05:35] <Bankzilla> hmm you can't seem to pull it on a diagonal either
[19:09:57] <xmaddness> I mean really, the handle is he border
[19:10:24] <xmaddness> So in this case I may just do a border right and bottom and make it 20px.
[19:12:53] <MudMonkey_> Hi all. I am trying to find out why I can't get prop("checked",true) to work on 1.7.2 (but attr works)
[19:13:36] <shoky> well this works: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/MjQKA/5/
[19:14:00] <shoky> following what that blog post said
[19:14:28] <shoky> MudMonkey_ can you jsfiddle it?
[19:15:19] <MudMonkey_> shoky yep, 1 sec
[19:16:17] <shoky> is it a dynamically loaded checkbox ;S ?
[19:17:03] <MudMonkey_> hmmm.... it is working in jsfiddle :|
[19:17:15] <shoky> what did you do differently
[19:17:16] <MudMonkey_> No it is not dynamic, but it is hidden. That shouldn't matter though
[19:17:54] <MudMonkey_> Let me double check. Thanks shoky, this has given me a hint :)
[19:18:00] <shoky> ;]
[19:34:04] <MudMonkey_> shoky, still there?
[19:34:18] <beancurd> nooooooooooooooooooooo
[19:34:40] <beancurd> LEAVE SHOKY ALONNEEEE
[19:34:43] <beancurd> T__T
[19:34:47] <MudMonkey_> :|
[19:34:54] <beancurd> :O
[19:35:36] <MudMonkey_> Oh it seems that prop("checked", true) on a hidden element doesn't work - but attr does.
[19:35:47] <MudMonkey_> I can't find this documented anywhere

[19:39:48] <richmond> how do i update a 1.5.2 jquery version to 1.7.2 without messing up?
[19:40:44] <shoky> i think except maybe the .prop/.attr thing there wasn't anything huge that should break yer app
[19:40:44] <Bankzilla> MudMonkey_ the checkbox is checked for me
[19:41:12] <MudMonkey_> Bankzilla really? with prop?
[19:41:17] <Bankzilla> yup
[19:41:21] <MudMonkey_> :O
[19:41:32] <richmond> it broke the animation =( couldn't find the solution yet
[19:41:32] <Gent> anyone know of a CDN with prettyPhoto plugin?
[19:41:37] <Bankzilla> even tested with unchecked and it changes it
[19:41:50] <dshap> hey all - i'm working on a browser extension and i'm trying to figure out the best way to determine when the browser's URL has changed and when the next page is finished loading.  i have a simple interval that compares window.location.href to what it was the last time, but the problem is i don't know how to figure out when the next page is done loading.  i tried $(window).load() but that doesn't seem to fire repetitively.  any ideas what i c
[19:41:50] <dshap> do here?
[19:41:52] <MudMonkey_> what browser are you using?
[19:41:58] <Bankzilla> firefox
[19:41:58] <shoky> MudMonkey_ but it works: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vmA5u/1/
[19:42:32] <Bankzilla> How were you testing it?
[19:42:43] <shoky> what do you mean
[19:42:46] <shoky> by looking at it
[19:42:50] <Bankzilla> @ MudMonkey_
[19:42:56] <shoky> oh sry
[19:43:28] <MudMonkey_> I was looking at the console output in firefox and chrome
[19:43:41] <shoky> what output
[19:43:56] <MudMonkey_> and it didn't add the "checked=checked" output I was expecting
[19:43:58] <fission6> how can i ajax submit a form, is there a way to get a data structure of all the form fields?
[19:44:02] <shoky> because that's the attribute
[19:44:10] <shoky> MudMonkey_ it's not supposed to add checked=checked
[19:44:19] <shoky> the DOM property was set fine
[19:44:24] <shoky> as you can see
[19:44:38] <MudMonkey_> I can see it now........
[19:45:47] <Bankzilla> @dshap: use $(document).ready(function{//});
[19:45:56] <MudMonkey_> hmmm, so prop doesn't actually add any code to the element - that news to me.
[19:46:04] <Bankzilla> That will fire after all dom objects are loaded
[19:46:11] <richmond> does google still host the cdn version of jquery 1.5.2?
[19:46:14] <MudMonkey_> Thanks guys for all your info
[19:46:25] <dshap> Bankzilla: tried this and it's still not working.  i think it may have something to do with the webpage that the extension is made for using an iFrame - would that be relevant?
[19:46:39] <shoky> ?serialize @ fission6
[19:46:40] <bot-t> fission6, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[19:47:34] <shoky> MudMonkey_ the html attributes are generally static and serve only as instructions on how to build the dynamic DOM
[19:47:39] <dshap> Bankzilla: yea actually don't think that's it.  this is definitely not firing repetitively
[19:47:39] <Bankzilla> dom would work even if in an iframe, although you'll have to reference to it differently if you're trying to get the url of the ifram
[19:48:01] <Bankzilla> I think to check if is an iframe, use if(top === self)
[19:48:27] <dshap> Bankzilla: it's an extension for use with Facebook.  when i have the extension loaded and i'm navigating facebook, $(document).ready() is not getting called every time i change pages
[19:48:55] <richmond> this template uses jquery 1.5.2 http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/34640.html
[19:49:33] <fission6> thanks shoky
[19:50:11] <MudMonkey_> shoky Thanks. new knowledge greedily accepted and stored :)
[19:50:36] <shoky> ;]
[19:51:47] <Bankzilla> dshap: try top.location.host save that and compare on every page change
[19:52:42] <dshap> Bankzilla: not sure how you are suggesting that i'd run code "on every page change"
[19:52:57] <dshap> Bankzilla: but i already have page change detection working by having an interval that runs every 100ms and then compares window.location.href
[19:53:17] <dshap> Bankzilla: the problem is that i need to call a function when the page changes, and i need it to run *after* the next page is loaded
[19:53:52] <dshap> Bankzilla: since a new page takes multiple seconds to load, running my function as soon as the location.href changes doesn't work
[19:53:56] <dshap> Bankzilla: see what i'm saying?
[19:54:53] <dshap> Bankzilla: i could resort to checking a DOM element that i know will change when the page changes, as opposed to checking window.location.href, but i feel like that's kind of a hack
[19:56:40] <Bankzilla> dshap: if you're able to continuously check the windows location, then why not assign a var on first page load then everytime after that check if it's the same as the current window.location if not run and else condition
[19:57:41] <dshap> Bankzilla: that's exactly what i'm doing.  here's what happens:  user clicks a link, interval detects that window's location has changed, function runs, but it runs so quickly that the new page hasn't even started loading.  the DOM has the old page's elements when the function runs
[19:57:54] <dshap> Bankzilla: the whole point of detecting the window location change is to run script on the *new* page
[20:09:05] <ZeuZ> Suppose I want to change the content of a <td> that has been clicked, how can I refer to the clicked <td>?
[20:09:39] <ZeuZ> I mean, $(document).on('click','td',function(){ //change stuff in clicked td });
[20:09:50] <ZeuZ> but how to refer to that td in particular in that function?
[20:10:01] <fission6> how do i get a value from a seralized form
[20:11:38] <tocka> hey guys
[20:11:59] <tocka> Im getting an error after I press any submit button
[20:12:01] <tocka> wtf ? http://jsfiddle.net/fLBVZ/2/
[20:12:36] <tocka> nvm
[20:12:39] <tocka> :)
[20:13:10] <fission6> any ideas for me?
[20:13:53] <shoky> what do you mean fission6
[20:15:01] <fission6> well i used serialize for the form and then posted using $.post which is a sucess, but in the post call back i want to get the value of one of the form fields, its odd that theres not a serializeToJSON or something
[20:15:28] <shoky> ZeuZ:  $(this)
[20:16:02] <ZeuZ> shoky, thanks
[20:17:04] <shoky> fission6 but you already have the form itself
[20:23:45] <johnkpaul> ?eval var obj={};"b=2&c=3&d=4".split("&").map(function(str){return str.split("="}).map(function(arr){obj[arr[0]]=arr[1];});obj;

[20:24:13] <bot-t> johnkpaul: {"b": "2", "c": "3", "d": "4"}
[20:24:30] <johnkpaul> @fission6 because I was somewhat bored
[20:24:43] <johnkpaul> but, shoky is right, don't use that, use the form itself
[20:26:48] <shoky> gnight ;p
[20:26:51] <MTPrower> Hiya awesome fun peeps.
[20:27:35] <ZeuZ> shoky, suppose I immediately after click want to unbind the event for ONLY that <td>
[20:27:50] <ZeuZ> why doesn't $(this).off('click'); work?
[20:27:50] <lenswipe> hey guys
[20:27:55] <lenswipe> i need help with some json
[20:28:29] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/J49KdvMN
[20:28:40] <pifantastic> ?one @ ZeuZ
[20:28:40] <bot-t> ZeuZ, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[20:28:48] <lenswipe> if i have something like that, can i traverse it using response.room.suite to get "VC-10" ?
[20:28:51] <lenswipe> is that legal?
[20:29:09] <pifantastic> yes
[20:29:13] <pifantastic> that is how you do it
[20:29:25] <MTPrower> I'm building a site and I know almost nothing about iframes or jquery, and very little even about PHP. I don't have the resources to pay someone to do anything for me. I need to duplicate a toggle button that brings out an iFrame. I have Firebug to help, but I simply don't know what I'm looking for. Can someone direct me to a channel or a tutorial or maybe help me here?
[20:29:25] <ZeuZ> pifantastic, thanks! gonna check that
[20:29:31] <lenswipe> strange because im getting undefined in my ajax success callback
[20:29:45] <lenswipe> pifantastic, want a pastebin?
[20:30:42] <lenswipe> pierreee, http://pastebin.com/J6QygRbP
[20:30:43] <lenswipe> err
[20:30:44] <pifantastic> lenswipe: fiddle is better
[20:30:44] <lenswipe> pifantastic, *
[20:30:47] <lenswipe> ok
[20:30:50] <ZeuZ> pifantastic, hmm, that has an undesired effect though, it unbinds the action for all <td>s
[20:31:14] <pifantastic> lenswipe: you are specifying the dataType as html, but it's json
[20:31:21] <lenswipe> oh shit, of course
[20:31:37] <ZeuZ> $(document).one('click','td',function() {
[20:31:37] <ZeuZ> 	var contenidoPrevio = $(this).html();
[20:31:37] <ZeuZ> 	$(this).html('<input name="data" value="'+previousContent+'"/>');

[20:31:42] <ZeuZ> sorry, long paste
[20:31:45] <pifantastic> ?p @ ZeuZ
[20:31:45] <bot-t> ZeuZ, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:32:05] <lenswipe> pifantastic, that fixed it, thank you so much
[20:32:12] <lenswipe> a fresh pair of eyes makes all the difference!
[20:32:14] <lenswipe> bye
[20:32:57] <ZeuZ> pifantastic, seems like .one() ain't what I'm after..
[20:33:01] <MTPrower> Does anyone know where I can find help finding and duplicating a button that toggles an iFrame on my site so that I can put it somewhere else on my site?
[20:33:18] <ZeuZ> The idea is unbind it right after it's clicked
[20:33:28] <ZeuZ> so maybe I'm using off() wrongly?
[20:33:59] <ZeuZ> $(this).off('click'); won't cut it, though and I'm not sure why
[20:34:36] <MTPrower> I know you guys are busy handling one problem already, but can anyone see me here? Just so I know?
[20:35:11] <ZeuZ> neither does: 	$(document).off('click',$(this));
[20:35:33] <Bankzilla> MTPrower I don't get your question
[20:35:33] <ZeuZ> It can't be too far off that
[20:35:41] <pifantastic> ZeuZ: http://jsfiddle.net/bBbxq/
[20:35:53] <MTPrower> Bankzilla: Oh good. I'm not invisible /nosarcasm
[20:36:20] <Bankzilla> why are you needing to duplicate a toggle button
[20:36:22] <pifantastic> ZeuZ: it's a bad idea to use html() though, you probably want .text()
[20:36:24] <MTPrower> Bankzilla: I have an iframe on my site that opens with a button. The problem is, the button is too hard to find. I want to move it to somewhere else on the page.
[20:36:50] <Bankzilla> MTPrower, do you want to move the button entirely?
[20:37:00] <Bankzilla> Can be achieved with html and css
[20:37:18] <MTPrower> Bankzilla: that would be nice, but I think it would complicate things. I think it would be less destructive to actually make a second button
[20:37:31] <MTPrower> Bankzilla: not that I really know anything to begin with : /
[20:37:49] <Bankzilla> MTPrower: I'll open a private chat and help you sort it
[20:37:56] <MTPrower> Bankzilla: I appreciate it
[20:40:34] <ZeuZ> pifantastic, http://190.16.86.49 user:test pass:test --> Even though I took your advice, to the bare foot, it doesn't work
[20:41:12] <ZeuZ> no <td> responds to it
[20:41:59] <pifantastic> ZeuZ: because you are not waiting for the $(document).ready event
[20:45:06] <ZeuZ> I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong then, it is inside $(document).ready($("td").one('click', ...
[20:51:15] <Cork> ZeuZ: you need to give an function to ready
[20:51:26] <Cork> you can't run commands as its arguments
[20:52:02] <Cork> ZeuZ: $(document).ready(function() {});
[20:58:33] <vl1234> gud mornin to every1
[20:59:24] <vl1234> http://jsfiddle.net/VqhJ7/6/ see this example and here i want to truncate r not display the extra word.........
[20:59:56] <vl1234> am tried the example last night but am not able to find the solution
[21:00:05] <ZeuZ> Cork, http://codepad.org/Khv6Yp3A --> Still, not working...
[21:00:28] <vl1234> its possible in jquery r css itself we have do some crazy things
[21:01:15] <Cork> ZeuZ: i see nothing in that code snippet that would prevent it from working
[21:01:24] <Cork> ?demo @ ZeuZ
[21:01:24] <bot-t> ZeuZ, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[21:01:49] <beancurd> vl1234: whut
[21:02:07] <ZeuZ> Cork, 190.16.86.49 user:test pass:test
[21:02:19] <ZeuZ> Cork, click Inventario for the <td>s to show
[21:03:09] <beancurd> vl1234: http://jsfiddle.net/VqhJ7/7/
[21:03:09] <vl1234> @beancurd.....Ar u seen my example
[21:03:19] <beancurd> do you mean like that?
[21:03:32] <beancurd> also, dropping random vowels is really confusing dude -_-
[21:04:16] <Cork> ZeuZ: your ajax loading your table, so the td doesn't exist when the ready triggers
[21:04:40] <ZeuZ> Cork, true that
[21:04:50] <Cork> ZeuZ: so you need to use the same delegate syntax your using for the other click events
[21:05:01] <ZeuZ> Cork, tried.
[21:05:10] <ZeuZ> Cork, the problem is unbinding them right after the click
[21:05:15] <vl1234> @beancurd.....may i know wt did
[21:05:27] <beancurd> text-overflow: ellipsis;
[21:05:28] <vl1234> @beancurd.....may i know wt u did
[21:05:37] <Cork> ZeuZ: you can't really do that with a delegated event
[21:05:50] <ZeuZ> What do you suggest?
[21:05:56] <vl1234> @beancurd....thankzzzzzz ill back
[21:06:15] <Cork> ZeuZ: you can move the one event listner into the success function of the ajax call
[21:08:26] <ZeuZ> Cork, tried doing that as you suggested, the problem is, the next td I click won't respond to the event
[21:09:02] <Eviltwin> Fucking badass Google homepage
[21:09:39] <ZeuZ> Eviltwin, fucking a! zipper yay! :P
[21:10:02] <ZeuZ> Cork, back on track, what you suggested works fine, for just one <td>, not for all of them..
[21:11:47] <ZeuZ> Cork, it would ideally need to work for any <td>
[21:12:24] <Bankzilla> Anyone know when pastie.org went down?
[21:12:28] <spoonybard> how can i tell jquery to only return the second column of a table?
[21:12:47] <Cork> ZeuZ: then you need to set a value on the td that you check if its been clicked or not
[21:12:53] <Cork> ?.data @ ZeuZ
[21:12:53] <bot-t> ZeuZ, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[21:13:14] <Cork> ZeuZ: .one is not an option if you want that
[21:14:17] <ZeuZ> Cork, not following you quite there
[21:14:36] <Cork> ZeuZ: when a click happens on an element set a value through data
[21:14:53] <Cork> and then check if that data is set
[21:15:03] <Cork> if it is, don't do anything
[21:16:25] <ZeuZ> Still not following, as that would also lead to a behaviour not wanted
[21:17:49] <ZeuZ> Guess I'll just sleep it off, and then re-read the data() function
[21:18:28] <Cork> ZeuZ: if your using one; that would mean the event triggers once, not once per element
[21:18:47] <Cork> once per page load, then the event listner is gone from all elements
[21:19:37] <Cork> ZeuZ: one is a form of bind, so it can only bind to element thats in the page
[21:20:49] <Cork> ZeuZ: theres a way around that by doing what delegate does on your own, but that means the filter would be per all elements of the interesting type in the page
[21:21:29] <ZeuZ> although it seems like that's what I'm after apparently
[21:21:53] <Cork> ZeuZ: so you want it to stop listning on one td element if you click another?
[21:22:38] <ZeuZ> In reality, the complete idea is that once you click a <td>, you change the data, hit enter, then it goes back to being a normal <td> with just text
[21:23:01] <Cork> and the other td elements?
[21:23:09] <Cork> (the ones you didn't click)
[21:23:10] <ZeuZ> Same behaviour
[21:23:19] <ZeuZ> (for when I click them)
[21:23:34] <Cork> ya, but thats not the behavior i describe
[21:23:42] <Cork> td1, td2, td3
[21:23:53] <Cork> if you click td1, td1-3 dies
[21:24:14] <Cork> if thats not what you want you need to use data
[21:25:20] <ZeuZ> Thing is I don't understand the how et all
[21:25:52] <ZeuZ> $(document).data('td',function(){....}); ?
[21:26:36] <Cork> ZeuZ: http://jsfiddle.net/RYkmM/
[21:31:25] <ZeuZ> Cork, yay! Thanks! :) That's half the problem though, how would I bind the "enter" key to the <input> ?
[21:31:45] <Cork> ZeuZ: same way
[21:32:04] <Cork> first you need to figure out if you need to do it delegated or not
[21:32:14] <ZeuZ> Thing is this way you described works, but I don't fully understand why
[21:33:13] <Cork> ZeuZ: delegated event listners work by binding on an existing parent then check the event.target element
[21:33:39] <Cork> ZeuZ: the the event.target element match the selector you have it triggers the function
[21:34:03] <Cork> ZeuZ: dom event bubbling/propagation is what makes this posible
[21:34:42] <Cork> ZeuZ: if you click ex. the td, the click fist fires on the td, then the tr, then tbody, table ... up to body followed by document
[21:34:52] <Cork> fist==first
[21:35:31] <Cork> ZeuZ: thats why you can't use one, cause there is only one event listner for all the elements your after
[21:35:57] <Cork> ZeuZ: so instead you set a value on the element that has been clicked and check for that
[21:36:11] <Cork> and you get the effect your after
[21:37:41] <ZeuZ> What about the keypress?
[21:39:16] <Cork> ZeuZ: like i said, you need to figure out if you need it to be delegated or not
[21:41:04] <shouryuken> whats is this called?  find('td:eq(2)')
[21:41:33] <shouryuken> putting a jquery function inside a selector like that
[21:42:17] <Cork> shouryuken: a selector?
[21:42:39] <Cork> your not really puting a function inside it
[21:42:48] <shouryuken> Cork, where in the api does it say you can put a function there
[21:42:56] <Cork> you just psudo selectors
[21:43:19] <Cork> well its not really a function, its a psudo selector that sizzle uses to locate and call a function
[21:43:44] <Cork> not thought that its always slower then calling the function directly
[21:43:48] <Cork> *note
[21:49:31] <aro> has anyone used zeroclip with jquery? or rewritten the zeroclip js file to work with jquery?
[22:06:07] <Whirl3d> Evening all. I would like to be able to store the function name of an initialization function in the markup for a div, how do I then call that function?  <div class='contentPage' data-init="initPage'>some stuff</div>
[22:07:41] <shouryuken> how can i avoid concatenating sub tags when Im using text()?
[22:08:09] <coldhead> find() something more specific or use html()
[22:10:37] <shouryuken> coldhead, i dont think find() will work with nth-child() and i dont want html, just text
[22:14:00] <shouryuken> $('table td:nth-child(2)') is what my code looks like
[22:31:04] <coldhead> shouryuken: if $('table td:nth-child(2)') is selecting multiple elements and you want to handle them separately, perhaps you want to use ?each
[22:31:04] <bot-t> shouryuken, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[22:31:17] <coldhead> or use ?map
[22:31:17] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[22:31:49] <shouryuken> coldhead, i am using each but some of the td tags have sub spans with text inside them
[22:32:03] <shouryuken> and i dont want that sub text
[22:32:36] <coldhead> .find(':not(sub)')
[22:32:45] <coldhead> or possible .filter(':not(sub)')
[22:33:23] <abjorn> bitchess
[22:34:36] <coldhead> abjsy
[22:34:41] <coldhead> you win the txjs lottery?
[22:35:26] <shouryuken> didnt work ('table#flightmatrix td:nth-child(2)').find(':not(span)').each()
[22:35:56] <jrred> hey guys, i'm super new at javascript and need a bit of guidance, i've got a python script which is returning json based on a call from a form, (i.e you type "search string" and it returns a list of stuff), i'd like to build a form that automatically pre-populates results based on that search string so you can select one of the options, for example, you type "coffee" and you get the list back of coffee shops. All the logic on how to get that
[22:36:07] <abjorn> coldhead: no ;-;
[22:36:14] <abjorn> I am very sad
[22:37:13] <coldhead> jrred: your message was truncated at "All the logic on how to get that"
[22:37:31] <coldhead> abjorn: i don't mean to be rude but you suck
[22:37:32] <jrred> …All the logic on how to get that list is all sorted by the python script, the issue for me is how to get the correct form setup on the javascript side, any tips at all would be welcome.
[22:37:44] <coldhead> get one of the late issued tickets or i will kill you
[22:37:44] <abjorn> And I don't mean to be kind but you're a cocksucker
[22:38:26] <jrred> it's very similar to the typeahead widgets on the jquery website but it's not quite because it requries a full string to be entered first
[22:38:49] <jrred> err "autocomplete" i think is what they're called
[22:38:51] <coldhead> jrred: you probably want to use ajax() to fetch the data, each() to iterate over it in the success handler and for more details you probably want to read a tutorial
[22:39:27] <jrred> any tips on where to find a decent tutorial for it? i've been looking and kind find it, i think i'm using the wrong terminology when searching
[22:39:40] <jrred> can't* not kind, i need sleep
[22:40:00] <coldhead> jrred: this one is pretty fresh http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/theme-development/add-jquery-autocomplete-to-your-sites-search/
[22:40:18] <shouryuken> coldhead, this returns the string in the sub tag which i dont want $('table#flightmatrix td:nth-child(2)').find(':not(sub)').each(function ()
[22:41:04] <coldhead> shouryuken: inside the each(), maybe if ($(this).is(sub)) return;
[22:41:13] <jrred> coldhead, so this is technically autocomplete even though the results aren't based on the string? for instance, the search string "coffee" shouldn't return "coffee XYZ, etc." it can return results like "Peet's Coffee"
[22:41:16] <coldhead> if that still doesn't get it we're going to need to see a demo
[22:41:48] <coldhead> jrred: the broad general is the same, you're asking the data for something ajaxy and doing something with what it returns
[22:41:57] <coldhead> squint your eyes, it's almost the same
[22:42:09] <jrred> alrighty
[22:42:18] <jrred> i'll read over that tutorial, thanks a bunch
[22:42:31] <coldhead> jrred: if you can get the browser and the server talking and link us to your working demo we can help you finish it
[22:42:53] <jrred> i've got most of it done :) i just need the last piece, that form
[22:43:32] <coldhead> good luck!
[22:45:57] <jrred> coldhead, i get lost in these tutorials fast when they start throwing about calling php pages
[22:46:23] <abjorn> coldhead: You should see Cabin in the Woods. Shit was bitchin. That trailer was so very misleading
[22:46:37] <Whirl3d> Only I would ever have a client that wanted 2 points of thickness added to their logo font without increasing the size of the seriffs. jeesh
[22:49:15] <coldhead> abjorn: people i admire are saying good things about it, it's on my list
[22:50:01] <abjorn> awwww you admire me
[22:50:16] <coldhead> jrred: can you just pretend PHP is standing for "Properly Handled by Python"?
[22:50:26] <coldhead> i will abjorn, if you get a txjs ticket
[22:50:44] <abjorn> I wish ;-;
[22:51:00] <jrred> coldhead, i like that
[22:51:41] <jrred> i read sentences like "If you can’t find searchform.php in your theme, then it’s probably using the default mark-up which is almost identical." and i'm like….wat.
[22:54:26] <coldhead> ugh those tutorials suck
[22:55:14] * jrred nods head
[22:56:18] <abjorn> which tuts
[22:58:51] <jrred> the one pasted above by coldhead
[23:00:56] <coldhead> JS tutes that aren't server side neutral
[23:04:01] <abjorn> oh werd
[23:04:02] <abjorn> yeah
[23:27:10] <jrred> coldhead, you still around?

[23:36:50] <coldhead> jrred: just debuggin something, won't be long
[23:36:55] <Jagan_> tell any gud website to study regular exp
[23:37:00] <jrred> cool, thanks
[23:37:39] <Whirl3d> Jagan, just download regexbuddy
[23:37:45] <Cork> ?g regular expresion @ Jagan_
[23:37:45] <bot-t> Jagan_, Regular expression - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression
[23:37:49] <Cork> uh
[23:38:03] <Cork> Jagan_: http://www.regular-expressions.info/
[23:38:18] <coldhead> read O'Reilly's Mastering Regular Expressions, case closed
[23:38:54] <abjorn> ^
[23:38:57] <Jagan_> Can  anyone tell me how to allow only mactched regular Expression values to enter into text field?
[23:39:04] <abjorn> Just read the first few chapters, though, the rest is basically reference
[23:39:17] <vitomd> http://www.rubular.com/
[23:40:21] <Whirl3d> jagan, capture each keystroke and compare the input value with your regular expression. If it matches, add the character to the input value, if not, ignore it
[23:43:03] <Zhy> What could be the reason(s)  that ajax pagination doesn't work after the first loading of a new table page? it works once, but then the javascript doesn't work at all (function which colours even and uneven table rows in different colours doesn't work either)... this is the case when I try to update (load the content into) a div that surrounds the pagination part and the table, when I only
[23:43:03] <Zhy> update a div surrounding the table, it duplicates the whole content, so I have the pagination twice (works as intended when using the non-duplicated pagination, still ne javascript in the duplicated part... I'm using CakePhp but cannot fathom whether it might be a JQuery/Ajax thing I'm missing since it's the Javascript that's missing after page load, so I'm asking here
[23:43:13] <Jagan_> ok thanks whilrl3d
[23:43:17] <abjorn> There's some HTML 5 stuff for it, you could make a jQuery plugin that does what Whirl3d said when it's not available
[23:43:19] <abjorn> polyfills!
[23:44:53] <Whirl3d> Zhy, let me be the first to say: build a jsfiddle with your use case and maybe we can help. Otherwise, it's a crapshoot.
[23:46:33] <Zhy> will try, Whirl3d, gotta see how to put into a fiddle what Cake generates
[23:47:35] <Whirl3d> Zhy, you might have to make two fiddles.  one with the raw html from cake that works. and then one with the "updated" content that doesn't.
[23:49:05] <hemangpatel> Cork : they fixed all problem in new version of tinymce.
