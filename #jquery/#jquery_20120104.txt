[00:14:03] <Hypah> ajax.googleapis.com flagged as a phishing site by opendns tonight.... great
[00:24:48] <cs32> what is the best way to handle views within a jquery plugin?
[00:25:42] <cs32> let's say i've got a jquery plugin that is an enhanced list view consisting of rich items (divs for the sake of this example) that have their own behaviors
[00:26:06] <cs32> should those divs be handled by a separate plugin?
[00:31:58] <cs32> is anyone paying attention? :)
[00:32:59] <xec> yes, but i have no answer :D
[00:34:15] <cs32> xec: :) It seems like something that people should have addressed in the past
[00:34:35] <cs32> xec: but i can't, for the life of me, find anything that shows how this should be done.
[00:38:52] <leipie> hello
[00:39:00] <leipie> I have a question
[00:39:04] <zChris> go on
[00:39:43] <leipie> I'm trying to load a page segment from a loaded page segment in a div defined in the containing page
[00:40:14] <leipie> and the loaded part ends up in a completely different place
[00:40:32] <cs32> the jquery plugin documentation at http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring says that you should invoke methods on your plugins by passing a string containing the method name to the plugin function. most of the plugins i've looked at don't do this. why is this?
[00:41:11] <leipie> zChris so I do $('#history_segment').load('/history)
[00:42:04] <leipie> and the result end up somewhere in the loaded segment in a newly created table tag magicly with the same id
[00:42:30] <grosboulet> Hello
[00:43:43] <leipie> zChris do you understand my problem?
[00:44:56] <grosboulet> If I use dataType in $.ajax() I have an error "parameter". I define dataType: "xml", and the url returns xml... What does this error mean ?
[00:48:08] <leipie> anyone know why $('div_id').load('url) would load in a different place in the DOM?
[00:50:18] <grosboulet> leipie: $.link() ?
[00:52:03] <leipie> grosboulet: sorry?
[00:53:27] <grosboulet> the function link() in jquery does near same thing ?
[00:54:20] <leipie> the documentation says it is for form fields
[00:55:16] <Cork> leipie: have you checked if the id exist multible times in the dom?
[00:55:41] <grosboulet> so you don't want to move a form field...
[00:56:05] <leipie> Cork: Yep, it did before and now magicly a new table tag appeared with the id of the selected div
[00:56:06] <mazzachre> Can I listen for an event when an input field is updated?
[00:56:18] <Cork> grosboulet: jquery doesn't have a function .link
[00:56:24] <mazzachre> A normal text or hidden field
[00:56:25] <leipie> Cork: if I check with firebug the div is selected
[00:57:12] <Cork> leipie: just before the .load do console.log($('[id="div_id"]').length);
[00:57:24] <Cork> then run the call and see what the console shows
[00:58:57] <grosboulet> mazzachre: .bind()
[00:58:58] <leipie> Cork: hmm length == 4
[00:59:13] <Cork> leipie: so you have 4 elements in the dom with that id
[00:59:19] <Cork> thats why you get the problem
[00:59:31] <Cork> id's can only exist once
[00:59:41] <Cork> every thing else and you get problems
[01:00:59] <leipie> Cork: thanks, I'll continue debugging ;)
[01:01:11] <Cork> np :)
[01:01:15] <mazzachre> grosboulet: Ya, but bind what? I have bind('change', function() {alert('MOO!')}); currently, but it never moos...
[01:01:37] <mazzachre> Which is strange.. I would expect it to moo actually
[01:01:48] <Cork> mazzachre: is this element replaced in the duration of the page?
[01:01:59] <Cork> or are you adding the listner before the element is added?
[01:06:49] <mazzachre> Cork: No, the element stays there and is not replaced... It is hidden, but before I do the listener... I have a widget that enhances an input field, first thing I do is this.element.hide().bind('change', {self: this}, function(event) {alert('MOO!')}); (The self is going to be used when I actually see this starting to work)
[01:07:42] <Cork> mazzachre: is the event triggered when you move focus?
[01:07:54] <Cork> (make the change, and move focus)
[01:10:29] <domcat> is it possible to blur images/content with JS (or css?)
[01:11:27] <mazzachre> Cork: I just did it via script... I did $('input').val('something'); and nothing happened, except ofcause the value changed, I can read the new value, but the event was not triggered.
[01:12:05] <Cork> mazzachre: .val() doesn't trigger events
[01:12:20] <Cork> change is only triggered by user input
[01:12:43] <coldhead> ?trigger
[01:12:51] <coldhead> oh you stupid bot-t :(
[01:12:56] <mazzachre> Cork: Ah...
[01:13:06] <coldhead> bot-t: tell bot-t i miss you bro
[01:13:18] <mazzachre> Then it makes sense...
[01:14:11] <mazzachre> Now the million dollar question, should I care about that? :D Or should I just let it be and let users use the widget options to change the value...
[01:14:19] <mazzachre> That is.. other programmers (or myself)
[01:24:51] <fRAiLtY-> Hi guys, I've got a pastebin here with a block of PHP/HTML code that I need to be in a nodeValue as per the pastebin, can anyone tell me what I need to do to avoid errors? http://pastebin.com/sbGvHgRK
[01:29:59] <aaronmcadam> ?php @ fRAiLtY-
[01:30:06] <aaronmcadam> ?botsnack
[01:30:15] <aaronmcadam> gr
[01:30:22] <fRAiLtY-> There's nothing wrong with the PHP, it's embedding it into the Java part I need help with aaronmcadam
[01:30:24] <aaronmcadam> basically don't show us php show us the output
[01:30:30] <fRAiLtY-> As the " marks will get confused :x
[01:30:45] <fRAiLtY-> The output is an image box, it's just a picture
[01:30:52] <aaronmcadam> why aren't u using a templater anyway
[01:31:06] <aaronmcadam> or are you doing "my first php app"?
[01:31:20] <fRAiLtY-> It's part of magento, I'm trying to make a javascript switcher to switch the image to a video on click of a link
[01:31:27] <fRAiLtY-> Using the code that's already there, just adding javascript
[01:31:44] <fRAiLtY-> I've got the switcher working, now I need to drop the Magento code into the Javascript to make it switch correctly
[01:31:53] <fRAiLtY-> That's where I've hit a snag
[01:33:09] <TheNoOne> hi .. i'm trying to create a balloon with animate() ... i'd like to y position in a sinus-shape and x position linear but i cant put this into one animate statement and if i'm putting it one after another it not gets extecuted at the same time ... how can i manipulate x and y with different functions at the same time using animate?
[01:34:07] <fRAiLtY-> aaronmcadam: I have a div called "switch" which holds the content, would it be better to have the image(php) part loaded in the div already then try and use javascript to just display it to none and view the video do you think?
[01:35:06] <aaronmcadam> yeah fRAiLtY-, if you're hitting the server just to retrieve the image
[01:35:15] <aaronmcadam> i've not looked at ur code, don't have time
[01:42:41] <TheNoOne> got it .. 'queue: false' :)
[01:47:53] <fRAiLtY-> Now modded, getting somewhere I think, http://dev.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing/5000-a6-fsc-300gsm-flyers.html <-- when image is clicked (and when page loads) it displays image which is right. When video is clicked it displays video text but I want the image to disappear, then re-appear when image is clicked again, how? https://gist.github.com/1559327
[02:00:55] <branant> Is there a way to delay() a slideDown()?
[02:01:44] <Cork> branant: you need to use the callbacks
[02:02:08] <branant> Cork: so $('#status').delay(800).slideDown(300); is not good enough?
[02:02:26] <Cork> uh...
[02:02:36] <Cork> nothing triggers the delay there
[02:02:46] <Cork> if thats all you need to use setTimeout
[02:02:53] <Cork> *all you want to do
[02:03:56] <Cork> setTimeout(function() { $('#status').slideDown(300); }, 800);
[02:04:42] <branant> Thanks will give that a pop.
[02:31:51] <talin_> hello
[02:32:05] <Deele> Hi
[02:32:37] <talin_> i have some DIVs and a text that i can click to display them. by default, they are hidden. right now, i can click a text and display all of them.. but i would like display a new one each time i click the text
[02:32:42] <talin_> is that possible?
[02:33:17] <talin_> like, i click the text and it displays the div called "one", i click the same text again and it displays the div called "two"
[02:33:21] <talin_> and so on
[02:33:25] <Deele> talin_: is it possible to paste your code in jsfiddle.net?
[02:33:34] <talin_> Deele: sure
[02:34:01] <Deele> meanwhile, could someone help me optimize those elem.find's @ my code? http://jsfiddle.net/Deele/yM7hF/
[02:35:50] <branant> Anyone see what might be wrong with this: $('h2#foo').animate({scrollTop: $(this).offset().top}, 500);
[02:35:55] <branant> (its not working)
[02:36:49] <talin_> Deele: strange, it works in browser but not in jsfiddle
[02:36:50] <talin_> http://jsfiddle.net/zECHz/
[02:37:50] <Deele> branant: to use $(this), encapsulate params in function() { }
[02:39:05] <branant> Deele: How?
[02:39:46] <MisterSpeaker> Can anyone suggest a better way to do this: http://pastebin.com/tWppDrsD - its just grabs all links on a page, finds the currently focused link, then focuses on the next link. I feel like I'm missing a simple one-liner, rather than the two operations.
[02:39:57] <Deele> branant:  $('h2#foo').each(function() { $(this).animate({scrollTop: $(this).offset().top}, 500); });
[02:40:35] <Deele> talin_: so, what did you wanted to achieve?
[02:41:25] <branant> Deele: still not working. the actual scrolling effect is whats missing.
[02:42:02] <Deele> branant: any errors in console?
[02:42:09] <branant> No :(
[02:43:26] <Deele> branant: try recreating your situation at jsfiddle.net
[02:43:27] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to js/jquery and wonder which is a common way for this: i have a loginform, after submitting data the server logs me in or redirects a url with /?loginerror … i don't want to have a page reload for this. if the server returns this error i just want to display an error at the form like addClass('error') … someone a hint for me?
[02:44:41] <Deele> talin_: you needed to add jquery framework to make it work http://jsfiddle.net/Deele/zECHz/1/
[02:45:55] <talin_> Deele: aaah. hmm, i think my code works now. it's ugly, but it works
[02:48:12] <MisterSp_> mightym: Then you need to submit the form via $.ajax rather than a regular submit post back. You have to handle both the success and error cases though!
[02:49:00] <mightym> MisterSp_: ok, thx a lot, ill check $.ajax
[02:50:42] <branant> Deele: have a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/8Jpjv/
[02:52:32] <Deele> branant: let's see..
[02:53:35] <fRAiLtY-> Anyone have any idea why this doesn't toggle between the 2 divs? http://pastebin.com/F3mc0uFW
[02:53:44] <fRAiLtY-> The link click does nothing
[02:54:57] <Deele> branant: so, what do you want to scroll?
[02:55:39] <branant> Deele: when the a#foo or a#bar is linked, instead of just skipping to the named anchor it should smoothly scroll to it
[02:56:04] <branant> s/linked/clicked
[02:56:10] <Deele> branant: you mean, "IT" -> screen/viewport?
[02:56:21] <branant> yup
[02:56:33] <branant> its the only thing with a scroll bar, right? ;)
[02:58:02] <Deele> branant: then you have first mistake
[02:58:16] <Deele> branant: you should make document scroll, not h2
[02:59:39] <iamcurio> how can i make the page fade out before loading the next page when i click a menu link
[02:59:41] <iamcurio> ?
[03:00:03] <branant> Deele: awesome! now should I use html, *, or window?
[03:01:42] <Zogot> Would love some feedback on http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/aFNwA/  Any better ways to write it, still pretty new to JS
[03:11:27] <Deele> branant: sry, had some network problems... see http://jsfiddle.net/Deele/8Jpjv/1/
[03:11:32] <mightym> MisterSp_: so far i understood how to send my form via post without a reload, but how do i catch the error url, and not redirect to a new page?
[03:12:46] <branant> Deele: thanks. does event.preventDefault(); stop the default named anchor behavior?
[03:14:05] <Deele> branant: yes
[03:14:20] <branant> Deele: smarty pants. thanks :)
[03:14:51] <mightym> MisterSP_: this is what i have so far http://pastie.org/3124107
[03:15:58] <zipace> hi, is the googleapis link for jquery down for anyone else (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js)?
[03:16:14] <zipace> quite a few sites are currently malfunctioning for me because of that
[03:16:34] <cheshair> zipace, same here
[03:16:46] <zipace> oh, whew, good to know
[03:16:49] <Deele> zipace: its working
[03:16:54] <Deele> zipace: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js
[03:16:56] <zipace> i was panicking and thought it's a network problem
[03:17:07] <cheshair> zipace, I thought it was due to some opendns banning
[03:17:20] <zipace> Deele, sorry, i'm getting a 404 for that url
[03:17:25] <cheshair> s/it was/it is/
[03:17:37] <Deele> zipace: no delay for me...
[03:17:42] <zipace> cheshair, are you serious about that? do i really have to stop using opendns because of that? :(
[03:18:00] <cheshair> zipace, Deele, what dns are you using?
[03:18:05] <zipace> opendns
[03:18:17] <Deele> cheshair: none
[03:18:43] <cheshair> zipace, i don't think you have to stop, i guess it's just some temporary malfunctioning
[03:18:56] <zipace> let's hope it is indeed just temporary
[03:18:56] <cheshair> Deele, none? you mean you run your own, don't you?
[03:20:17] <Deele> cheshair: I use the one ISP gave
[03:20:24] <cheshair> zipace, this can help http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/117839/ajax-googleapis-com-blocked-by-opendns-confirmation
[03:20:38] <cheshair> Deele, well that's not none :-)
[03:20:48] <Deele> :)
[03:20:48] <zipace> relevant: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/117839/ajax-googleapis-com-blocked-by-opendns-confirmation
[03:21:02] <cheshair> zipace, gotcha! :-)
[03:21:04] <zipace> cheshair, haha, same fools, same thought
[03:21:21] <cheshair> :)
[03:24:48] <zipace> this is truly frustrating
[03:31:03] <zipace> maybe its related to the SOPA stuff everyone is talking about (http://www.extremetech.com/computing/111543-google-amazon-facebook-and-twitter-considering-nuclear-option-to-protest-sopa)
[03:40:57] <caruso_g> Hi, I am having issues with tabs, they are no more working on my site after I upgraded WP to 3.3. I also tried with the basic example on jqueryUI but it doesn't work as well. You can take a look at it here: http://www.triridemtb.com/news/miscellaneous/happy-year/
[03:41:16] <zipace> cheshair, it's working again :P
[03:41:33] <zipace> apparently someone at opendns got their shit together
[03:41:35] <cheshair> zipace, really?? nice to hear that!
[03:42:07] <caruso_g> when I try `$('#tabs').tabs()` in the console I get the following error: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined`
[03:42:40] <cheshair> zipace, no doubt it's been rather terrifying... all this mess to have your sites perfectly running and then such 3 hours down
[03:43:05] <_|Nix|_> Hey! So, what's the status of .super for accessing the superclass of jQuery widget factory-based widgets? There was gonna be something like that, IIRC ...
[03:43:37] <_|Nix|_> I'm finding that I'd rather not chain up to a specific class, in case I later rearrange my class hierarchy ...
[03:43:46] <zipace> cheshair, hmhm, well, since roughly each and every javascript powered site uses jquery, that is
[03:44:03] <zipace> i just wonder why they flagged it as phishing in the first place
[03:45:15] <cheshair> zipace, still not working here though
[03:45:33] <zipace> oh :(
[03:48:22] <caruso_g> any issue?
[03:48:58] <xec> caruso_g: maybe your jQuery is too old?
[03:49:54] <caruso_g> xec:  it is the latest version. 1.7.x :(
[03:51:29] <xec> caruso_g: oh right, i looked at the wrong file. what is jquery.tools.min.js?
[03:52:19] <silv3r_m00n> hi there, here is a menu on the page and I want to make it fixed so that when the list is scrolled down , the menu stays visible (like gmail) , please suggest a few plugins
[03:52:34] <caruso_g> xec: it is a library we are using for scrollable effects. Really nice, you can find it here: http://flowplayer.org/tools/index.html
[03:53:05] <xec> and tabs as well?
[03:53:29] <caruso_g> xec: do you think they could conflict?
[03:53:50] <xec> caruso_g: well, when i test .tabs() i get an error from that file
[03:54:58] <caruso_g> xec: I thought it too, tried to disable it but still tabs don't work
[03:55:10] <caruso_g> xec: it is three days I am trying to debug it, I am hopeless :(
[03:56:25] <mightym> well thank you anyway!
[03:56:30] <caruso_g> xec: please, refresh now, I disabled it.
[03:58:06] <xec> caruso_g: the error disappeared at least
[03:58:27] <xec> caruso_g: and the #tabs div got a .ui-tabs class set on it
[03:58:39] <xec> caruso_g: did you include the jquery ui css?
[03:58:54] <caruso_g> xec: nope
[03:59:25] <risky_s> non-related html php question
[03:59:37] <risky_s> how do I execute a php file from a input button?
[04:00:21] <risky_s> onclick="file.php"
[04:00:22] <risky_s> ?
[04:01:47] <caruso_g> xec: now the function .tabs() returns no error, so do you think it is just a CSS issue? I mean, the initial states of visible/hidden containers? Could be… :O
[04:01:57] <xec> risky_s: in html5 you can do formaction="file.php" i believe
[04:02:31] <xec> caruso_g: maybe, try including the css and see :)
[04:04:29] <risky_s> does formaction need the button to be in a form?
[04:04:40] <risky_s> my button needs to open up a PDF file
[04:04:55] <xec> why don't you just use a link?
[04:05:20] <risky_s> the pdf file is being generated from a php file
[04:05:37] <xec> link to the php file?
[04:06:01] <caruso_g> xec: it is working… :)
[04:06:14] <xec> caruso_g: nice :)
[04:06:23] <caruso_g> xec: I owe you a beer
[04:11:00] <fatninja> I was using jquery validation class , I was submitting the form with <input type='submit' value='Go'> thing, since I switched to <a href='javascript: document.form.submit()'>Go</a>
[04:13:09] <fatninja> it doesn't validate anymore
[04:17:01] <xec> fatninja: you should avoid inline scripting, use unobtrusive methods instead
[04:17:12] <fatninja> unobstrutive ?
[04:17:41] <xec> i.e. put any and all javascript in its own file(s), not mixed in with html
[04:18:33] <xec> so, if you want an a element to submit a form, you can do something like: $('a').click(function(){ $('form').submit() });
[04:20:14] <xec> of course, ID's are a much better choice for selectors, but you get the idea
[04:21:32] <fatninja> yes , I'm trying this now
[04:23:12] <seutje> hmz, trigger method doesn't support multiple events at once?
[04:23:20] <seutje> like $foo.trigger('keyup focus')
[04:23:37] <seutje> feeling silly doing $foo.trigger('keyup').trigger('focus')
[04:25:46] <fatninja> the thing is now it verifies it but then it goes to the href='' value..
[04:25:47] <fatninja> this is weird
[04:28:37] <Trudko> guys I want to find out all elements which id start with "SomeString_someNumber_someNumber. I know values except the middle someNUmber...
[04:29:47] <Cork> Trudko: best solution is: use a class
[04:30:07] <Cork> else you would have to resort to attribute search
[04:30:16] <Trudko> Cork I agree, but I frea I cant use it
[04:32:39] <Cork> Trudko: the best you can do is something like: $('*[id$="_someNumber"]').filter('*[id^="SomeString_s"]
[04:32:49] <Cork> ')
[04:34:32] <JSM87> Hi guys, I have a plugin that has a configuration option auto: 0 - I would like to create a button that when pressed sets that option to auto:1 to hopefully change the behaviour of the plugin on the fly. Is this possible? If so, how. Thanks
[04:35:05] <xec> fatninja: you can use event.preventDefault() to prevent the browser from following the link, (where "event" is the 1st argument in the handler, like .click(function(event){ etc.. }) )
[04:35:21] <phobia> Hi! :) Are there any way of selecting the element before something? like for this html: http://pastie.org/3124476 I want to select the li before and after .target. Is it possible? I can get the li after by doing $('.target + li'), but not the before element
[04:36:28] <xec> phobia: you could use .next() and .prev()
[04:37:12] <phobia> xec: I was hoping to do it just using a selector, but it might not be possible then? :)
[04:37:54] <xec> phobia: not that i know of
[04:42:02] <ghinda> does anybody know a plugin to implement data Models? something similar to JMVC's Model
[04:43:14] <phobia> xec: ok, thanks though :)
[04:43:23] <Famic> hi
[04:43:29] <Famic> is there a way to check the http return code of a url ?
[04:44:07] <Trudko> Cork: ok will check it
[05:14:10] <eshlox> hi, <div><div><input name="a" /></div></div> its possible to set class for first div when i have only $(element.form)? i want <div class="x"><div><input name="a" /></div></div>, i can find label for this input using $(element.form).find("label[for=" + element.id + "]") but how find div two levels above?
[05:15:09] <x-ip> hi, i'm getting an error in firebug console that says: getpkg_progress_status is not defined, but i have that function defined http://pastebin.com/jweVTu8w , surely i am doing something wrong in js, what am i doing wrong ?
[05:15:15] <seutje> paren().parent() or parents().eq(2) or something
[05:16:14] <seutje> eshlox: setInterval("getpkg_progress_status()", 3000); -> setInterval(getpkg_progress_status, 3000);
[05:16:27] <x-ip> thanks seutje :)
[05:16:31] <x-ip> trying that
[05:16:42] <seutje> not sure if that'll fix ur problem, but using a string is evil
[05:16:54] <seutje> oh, sry eshlox, the parent parent shizzle was for u
[05:17:01] <eshlox> ;-)
[05:17:46] <seutje> why the blank divs though? causes nothign but headaches
[05:17:49] <_dave_h_d> hi all, the function "remove" has suddenly started appending it self to an array as an array element, am I doing something wrong?
[05:18:12] <seutje> _dave_h_d: WAT?
[05:18:33] <seutje> u mean all arrays have a remove function?
[05:18:41] <seutje> method*
[05:18:58] <udp> _dave_h_d: you added it to the Array prototype?
[05:19:01] <seutje> smells like some1 fucked ur Array prototype
[05:19:12] <udp> are you looping through the array with for .. in?
[05:19:24] <udp> you should always use for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; ++ i) for that reason
[05:19:51] <eshlox> seutje: ok, it works, thanks
[05:19:53] <seutje> yea, or u'll have to go all .hasOwnProperty() and u rly don't wanna go there
[05:20:01] <max> test
[05:20:04] <max> hello
[05:20:47] <seutje> it works!
[05:21:58] <is_null> hi all, i have to re-order elements based on a javascript array of objects, question is: is there any particular technique or function i should know to do it right(tm) ?
[05:23:00] <Cork> is_null: yes use array .sort
[05:23:19] <Cork> give it a function and compare the objects members you want to compare
[05:23:24] <Cork> ?mdc array sort
[05:23:25] <bot-t1> Cork, sort - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Sorts the elements of an array in place. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[05:23:43] <seutje> might have to detach first
[05:24:26] <_dave_h_d> udp: what is the best strategy when it comes to dealing with this?, remove the function each time?
[05:24:58] <seutje> _dave_h_d: just don't for in
[05:25:14] <_dave_h_d> seutje: what should one do instead?
[05:25:24] <seutje> udp | you should always use for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; ++ i) for that reason
[05:25:36] <seutje> although I'd cache the length value :P
[05:25:41] <udp> _dave_h_d: it's not actually in the array, it's in Array.prototype - so you couldn't remove it from the array if you tried
[05:25:52] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/2lbgkfm7y0javseia2og - I have two date fields, from and to - I want the from date to be from today, and the to date to be the time after, can't seem to figure it out
[05:26:04] <_dave_h_d> udp: so how should one deal with it?
[05:26:14] <udp> _dave_h_d: either find out what's adding it to Array.prototype, or just don't use for .. in
[05:26:19] <seutje> there's a glitch in the matrix
[05:26:49] <sacho> using for..in to loop over an array's elements is very redundant. Why have an array at all then?
[05:27:00] <seutje> INORITE?
[05:27:17] <seutje> I guess ppl from PHP are used to not rly having arrays at all
[05:27:22] <seutje> so they just threat it all the same
[05:27:45] <sacho> sure, php arrays are really badly named.
[05:29:35] <is_null> Cork: the array is sorted server side, but i wonder how i should move html elements: 0) copy into variable (el = $('foo')) 1) remove the field (el.remove()) 2) put it in the right place (place.before(el)) ?
[05:30:05] <is_null> or is there a function to move an element *like* el.moveBefore(place)
[05:30:29] <Cork> ?.insertBefore @ is_null
[05:30:29] <bot-t1> is_null, .insertBefore(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements before the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[05:30:45] <Cork> you can only have a dom element once in the dom, so insert will move it
[05:30:53] <Industrial> Hey. I want to slide an element (block) into the page, and another out. How do I do this?
[05:31:25] <Cork> ?.animate @ Industrial
[05:31:25] <bot-t1> Industrial, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[05:32:12] <is_null> Cork: excellent, thanks
[05:32:18] <seutje> is_null: I often do this by simply re-appending them to their container in the order of my sorting array
[05:33:01] <_dave_h_d> so seutje: never user for in? and use for instead?
[05:34:09] <udp> _dave_h_d: yes, unless it's an Object you're iterating through
[05:34:19] <Cork> _dave_h_d: exactly, thats the best practis
[05:34:46] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/2lbgkfm7y0javseia2og - what am I doing wrong? When selecting "from" date, I can only select the same date in "to"...
[05:35:03] <ghinda> would it be possible to bind a custom event using .bind, and be able to aceess it like event(properties), without having to use trigger?
[05:35:18] <Cork> ghinda: no
[05:35:27] <_dave_h_d> seutje: but if it is an object use for in?
[05:35:49] <ghinda> Cork: would it be possible to make a plugin run only on certain objects? that way I could use .fn and have a similar behaviour
[05:35:51] <Cork> _dave_h_d: and don't forget to use hasOwnProperty
[05:36:01] <Cork> _dave_h_d: else you don't know what your counting
[05:36:05] <_dave_h_d> Cork: yes i know that one
[05:36:15] <Ilian> Hi
[05:36:17] <_dave_h_d> all my code pass through most brutal jslint settings
[05:36:21] <Cork> ghinda: not really
[05:36:31] <ghinda> Cork: oh man.. thanks anyway!
[05:36:46] <Ilian> is there a way to use jquery-ui-i18n with different dateFormat settings the the locale one?
[05:37:09] <Ilian> i.e. I only need the text translation, not the regional stuff
[05:37:13] <udp> _dave_h_d: remember jslint is quite ... opinionated
[05:37:23] <_dave_h_d> so seutje: still not really sure how to solve the issue of having my prototype function appearing as an element?
[05:37:37] <_dave_h_d> by not using push?
[05:37:39] <udp> there's definitely a glitch in the matrix
[05:37:43] <udp> by not using for .. in
[05:37:53] <udp> that's all
[05:37:59] <nisseni> anyone?
[05:38:31] <Cork> _dave_h_d: prototype functions is always shown in console.log, no way around that
[05:38:40] <seutje> _dave_h_d: if u can't use a regular for loop, u'll have to use hasOwnProperty, which is flipping annoying
[05:38:54] <_dave_h_d> seutje: cool
[05:39:06] <udp> _dave_h_d: you could make your own function to print the array that doesn't include members of the prototype
[05:39:29] <_dave_h_d> udp: the problem is i am using dynatree
[05:39:33] <seutje> tbh, that function shouldn't even be there
[05:39:43] <seutje> something is doing evil shit on ur page
[05:40:08] <seutje> tbh, I don't really see the point of a remove function on arrays
[05:40:32] <udp> splice!
[05:41:06] <seutje> well, it might do something else entirely
[05:41:35] <seutje> for all I know, it might create an ascii clock to float after ur mouse
[05:45:36] <tcurdt> jquery mobile loads a page via ajax. both pages have an element of class "navigation" ... in pageinit/pagechange/pageshow I now see multiple of these elements. I guess one from each page.
[05:46:13] <tcurdt> that's a problem for my init code ... at least I would need to know what the element from the current page is
[05:47:31] <tcurdt> shouldn't the old page be removed from the DOM before pageinit/pagechange is being called?
[05:49:19] <Trudko> will I save some time if I don't do $(this) twice but rather I do var thisEl = $(this) and then use thisEl twice?
[05:53:58] <Guest303> Can i ask for help here?
[05:55:03] <sirfilip> hello
[05:55:19] <sirfilip> what is the best jquery tree plugin out there
[05:55:27] <sacho> Trudko: yes

[05:58:09] <jac0bz1> Hi!
[05:58:24] <Guest303> Can anybody please help me with this (simple) script - http://pastebin.com/iW72s81n - i want to just send the form i have without page refhresh - without validating ANYTHING, just send the damn form and display success message!
[05:58:50] <Guest303> PS.: Yes - I'm a TOTAL Newbie with no understanding of JavaScript
[05:59:19] <Trudko> sacho: and do I have to? I am using find. each does jquery make it automaticly converty it to jquery objec or do I need to do it bymyself.
[05:59:31] <Guest303> Or maybe - You know where to point me? What tutorials i should search for etc?
[05:59:50] <jac0bz1> Guest303: What does the console say?
[05:59:53] <Guest303> I only need to send the form, no validations or anything fancy
[06:00:01] <Guest303> ..without page refresh.
[06:00:08] <jac0bz1> we got that allready
[06:00:38] <Guest303> Any help is greatly appreciated!
[06:01:00] <Guest303> PS.: Found the script i showed @ http://www.9lessons.info/2009/04/submit-form-jquery-and-ajax.html
[06:01:22] <jac0bz1> Guest303: What is the problem with the code? What does the console say? Does "join.php" exists?
[06:02:03] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/2lbgkfm7y0javseia2og - what am I doing wrong? When selecting "from" date, I can only select the same date in "to"... I want to be able to select all dates after the "from" date
[06:02:09] <Guest303> but this damn thing validates all those fields - I on the other hand just want to send a form that just updates a field in the mysql database
[06:04:13] <jac0bz1> Guest303: http://pastebin.com/euGfs6My
[06:04:20] <jac0bz1> not tested
[06:04:53] <fatninja> does anyone have any idea how to remove the horizontal scrolling bar from a fancybox ? (changing width of the div doesn't seem to work… )
[06:05:40] <jac0bz1> fatninja: I havent used it, but i guess it include content throuh an iframe?
[06:05:59] <fatninja> it is possible , I don't know it that well either
[06:06:16] <jac0bz1> check the output in the console
[06:06:40] <fatninja> no iframe
[06:07:51] <jac0bz1> use overflow: hidden
[06:08:22] <jac0bz1> or auto
[06:09:09] <fatninja> hm
[06:09:35] <fatninja> let me see if there is another way, because on smaller width divs it worked, I may have some bogus css rule
[06:10:40] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ fatninja
[06:10:48] <Eviltwin> ...
[06:10:52] <Eviltwin> fatninja: fixingthesejquery.com
[06:11:09] <Eviltwin> They walk you through the dev tools
[06:11:16] <Eviltwin> And you can see the CSS viewer
[06:11:28] <Eviltwin> Shows you all the rules applied to an element in the order of precidence
[06:12:46] <fatninja> oh , that is very nice
[06:12:52] <fatninja> ty for sharing
[06:13:44] <gnarf> there's also a really good video on the chrome dev tools by paul irish from google IO
[06:17:51] <nocturnal> I'm learning how to submit a form with jquery and it's not working well because the form keeps being submit the old way. as if preventDefault() had no effect. http://swehack.se/kontakt.html it starts on line 61
[06:18:19] <nine2five> hey there
[06:18:47] <edulterado> hi there, I was trying to show a div which was hidden with CSS by using toggle(), it works as expected, but when adding "this" for preventing bubbling the animation to other divs with the same class, the code doesn´t work
[06:18:53] <edulterado> here it´s the code, it´s pretty simple: http://pastebin.com/rf7ewtbc
[06:19:08] <edulterado> I don´t understand why "this" doesn´t work there
[06:20:12] <nine2five> edulterado: well, i'm not an jquery-master, but I think you should read $(this) vs this chapter once again.
[06:20:28] <nine2five> I don't know the answer, but I still find this difference really tricky
[06:20:43] <nine2five> I have a question about validation plugin
[06:21:06] <nine2five> names of inputs contain special characters
[06:21:15] <nine2five> e.g. name="form[title]"
[06:21:29] <edulterado> thank you, nine2five :) i will clarify myself that difference
[06:21:46] <Cork> edulterado: is .service-links.collapsed children to .service-links-button ?
[06:21:47] <nine2five> now I want to set some rules for each of that inputs
[06:21:53] <ilrisopatrone> hi guys
[06:22:14] <Cork> edulterado: if yes, then your code should work
[06:22:23] <edulterado> Cork: that´s it, no, they´re completely independent
[06:22:33] <nine2five> http://pastebin.com/6xiAseYu this is the way I made it
[06:22:33] <Cork> then remove , this
[06:22:36] <edulterado> that makes sense
[06:22:53] <ilrisopatrone> I've set a basic demo of what i'm trying to achieve here http://jsfiddle.net/A5mxh/ What i'm trying to do is to keep the menu div stuck at the top as you scroll into it. How could i do that?
[06:23:11] <nine2five> unfortunately form[title] doesn't work. is there any possibility to do that ?
[06:23:17] <edulterado> Cork, if I remove it, how can I prevent bubbling the animation of other divs in the page with the same class?
[06:23:21] <Cork> nine2five:: you need to use strings
[06:23:30] <nine2five> so
[06:23:42] <Cork> "form[title]":
[06:23:43] <nine2five> instead of form[title] i should use "form[title]"
[06:23:48] <Cork> yes
[06:23:48] <nine2five> thank you very much
[06:24:00] <Eviltwin> nine2five: You need to put your .submit code inside that $(document).ready block
[06:24:03] <jminuscula> hi there :)
[06:24:08] <Cork> edulterado: bubbling?
[06:24:23] <Cork> edulterado: you mean that the pressed link takes all elements on the page?
[06:24:30] <edulterado> Cork: exactly
[06:24:43] <fatninja> I have an image and I have a $("").click action on it, how do I make it so when the mouse is over it , it will look like a hand, the way it transforms when you hover a link
[06:24:54] <Cork> edulterado: hows the relation between button and .service-links?
[06:25:01] <Cork> sibling?
[06:25:07] <Cork> inside a sibling container?
[06:25:09] <edulterado> no, they´re two independent divs
[06:25:16] <jminuscula> I want to add a node with a click event to a series of other nodes. If I use global_node.insertAfter(e) the content is added, but the event is lost
[06:25:36] <Cork> edulterado: and they arn't positioned relative to eachother in any way (in the dom that is)
[06:25:38] <Eviltwin> nocturnal: You need to put your .submit code inside that $(document).ready block
[06:25:38] <jminuscula> I've found that inserting a global_node.clone(true) does the trick; is this clone mandatory?
[06:25:55] <edulterado> Cork: they´re contained under the same div
[06:25:57] <Eviltwin> fatninja: That can be done with CSS and :hover
[06:26:13] <Cork> edulterado: and each par has there own parent?
[06:26:16] <nine2five> Cork: can validation rules be established for elements having specific class ?
[06:26:28] <Cork> nine2five: donno
[06:26:33] <Eviltwin> fatninja: http://rainbow.arch.scriptmania.com/css/css_cursor_control.html
[06:26:36] <kul> I would like to add id to <li> elements available in my page. how shall I do that ?
[06:26:37] <edulterado> Cork: both have the same parent container
[06:26:52] <kul> I know its something to do with array
[06:27:11] <Cork> edulterado: then do $(this).parent().find(".service-links.collapsed")
[06:27:18] <nocturnal> Eviltwin: oh I see
[06:27:29] <edulterado> Cork: thank you, I´ll explore that
[06:27:38] <nocturnal> Eviltwin: I actually pulled it out of there because it didn't work hehe but I've been editing a lot of it so maybe I fixed whatever wasn't working before.
[06:30:06] <nocturnal> now it works
[06:31:25] <_ramo> hi
[06:31:39] <_ramo> how can i send data via post to a resource per ajax?
[06:31:51] <nine2five> any symfony2 developer here ? I have a question related to both symfony2 and jquery
[06:31:59] <Trudko> guys I want to change name and id( i know i should not change id) of element shoiuld I use prop or attr?
[06:32:48] <Shwaiil> hi
[06:33:39] <Shwaiil> Q: How valid is to do this in doctype html5, for a element let's say <a href="" title=""></a> add non html attr like <a my-special-attr="" href="" title"></a> ? Tks for looking!
[06:34:00] <Shwaiil> Note: I'm seeing lots of people doing this in their scripts, that's why i'm asking, because I've allways sticked with classes and IDs
[06:34:09] <ablomen> Shwaiil, use data- attributes
[06:34:14] <Shwaiil> Any comments are appreciated
[06:34:20] <ablomen> they are valid (google data attributes if you want)
[06:34:25] <Eviltwin> http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[06:34:26] <Shwaiil> ablomen:  tks for looking! data attributes ?
[06:34:31] <Shwaiil> hmmm ok ok i'll check that thanks :D
[06:34:37] <Shwaiil> didnt knew about it
[06:35:53] <ablomen> also, you can easily get at them with jquery by for example doing: html> <a href="#" data-foo="bar"></a> js> $("a").data("foo"); // returns "bar"
[06:37:22] <fatninja> I have an image that on click has $("#form").submit(), but it doesn't submit, <input type="submit"> works, this doesn't… I put an alert('a') so it enters in the function , but does not submit.
[06:37:53] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ fatninja
[06:37:53] <bot-t> fatninja, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[06:38:06] <Shwaiil> ablomen: thanks :)
[06:38:43] <fatninja> can I use query in jsfiddle ?
[06:38:52] <ablomen> fatninja, yes
[06:38:55] <fatninja> ok
[06:39:27] <fatninja> I also use a jq validator plugin
[06:39:28] <fatninja> ..
[06:39:52] <ablomen> fatninja, put a script tag in the html part to an online version of the plugin
[06:40:07] <Eviltwin> Actually use Add Resources on the left
[06:40:10] <Eviltwin> And reference it there
[06:40:14] <ablomen> ah even better

[06:43:41] <O_> hello
[06:47:10] <djnewbie> hi all, i have a page using jquery that uses ajax on the form post to validate and save the form submission before doing more work on the page. It works fine. But..(always a but), I want to employ a site-wide jquery function to disable all submit buttons on the site when the form submit is clicked - and then execute the submit function. I"ve got code to do this, and works - except when the form submits are ajax calls. Instead of posting the ajax
[06:47:37] <O_> I have a problem with chrome, blockUI plugin and the .data() method.
[06:48:23] <sphinxxx> is history.js only needed if you want to support history in non-html5 browsers?
[06:48:50] <O_> when i try to unblock the ui the plugin tries to get var data = $el.data('blockUI.history');
[06:49:25] <O_> and an exception is thrown at acceptData: function( elem ) {
[06:49:56] <O_> at "var match = jQuery.noData[ elem.nodeName.toLowerCase() ];"
[06:50:20] <O_> toLowerCase() - undefined method
[06:50:37] <O_> it only happens for chrome
[06:50:40] <diverdude> Is there a jquery framework similar to FAYE for pub/sub messaging for the web? (http://faye.jcoglan.com/node.html) ?
[06:50:42] <O_> not for ie nor ff
[06:52:06] <tcurdt> is there way for the header bar in jquery to be sticky across pages?
[06:52:47] <Eviltwin> djnewbie: Something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/TTfYT/
[06:53:04] <Eviltwin> O_: Are you unblocking the same element youblocked?
[06:53:11] <tcurdt> ...and by jquery I meant jquery mobile
[06:53:37] <O_> any one ever encountered such a problem with acceptData?
[06:54:06] <diverdude> any1?

[06:56:33] <Chopps> does jquery have a method to check if some value is an integer?
[06:56:49] <Eviltwin> Chopps: What do you mean?
[06:57:09] <diverdude> Eviltwin, hmm that looks really small...
[06:57:23] <Chopps> i want to check if a value is an integer, does jquery have any function that checks that?
[06:57:41] <djnewbie> Eviltwin: that doesnt have a wrapper, and generally there's only one submit button on a given page. I just want a global wrapper so I dont have to add code to disable each and every button for every form on every page on a website - which will then call the form's custom submit.
[06:57:58] <Eviltwin> diverdude: There's not a lot to pub sub
[06:58:18] <necromancer> faye rules
[06:58:39] <necromancer> diverdude: you can use Faye with jQuery iirc
[06:59:01] <diverdude> necolas, really?
[06:59:03] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/bT5R4/ (using jQuery Cloud Zoom) - can somebody help me find the bug that's causing 1px of the entire right side of the zoomed image to get cut off?
[06:59:06] <diverdude> necromancer, ^
[06:59:06] <necromancer> diverdude: yeah you don't need it... http://railscasts.com/episodes/260-messaging-with-faye?view=asciicast
[06:59:18] <troubleman> Eviltwin: got a reply from the author, he said it had to be a minor bug..
[06:59:18] <necromancer> just make an ajax request to your-faye-server/faye
[06:59:52] <necromancer> Faye just handles the server part, but it's HTTP so you can just make a regular ajax request to it
[06:59:53] <diverdude> necromancer, ahhh really fancy
[06:59:57] <diverdude> necromancer, i like this
[07:00:10] <necromancer> yeah faye is my fav
[07:00:23] <diverdude> necromancer, can i see what you used it for?
[07:01:00] <necromancer> diverdude: the only time i've used it really was in the "Meet Node.JS" tutorial
[07:01:00] <faustFederel> hello, I'm using jquery draggable on a td element (helper: clone, appendTo: 'body'). when the helper is dropped on a droppable it isn't deleted by jquery (as it normally should?) and I get this error message in the web console : " $(this).data("draggable") is undefined"
[07:01:16] <faustFederel> any idea?
[07:01:42] <diverdude> necromancer, oh ok... it just sounded like you had done a lot of IM systems :)
[07:01:54] <necromancer> diverdude: no, but i've done a lot of research into them
[07:02:04] <fatninja> ok I give up , I will js fiddle this..
[07:02:07] <diverdude> necromancer, are you planning to make one?
[07:02:13] <necromancer> kind-of
[07:02:37] <necromancer> diverdude: i designed an XMPP-based radio station, essentially, but i haven't coded it
[07:02:50] <diverdude> necromancer, nice...in the future or right about now?
[07:03:16] <necromancer> instead of connecting to a constantly-running audio stream, the pub/sub system simply pushes tracks to your computer
[07:03:33] <necromancer> so while you're listening to one track, another downloads in the background
[07:04:10] <necromancer> so you can seek and re-listen to tracks or DJ talk spots in the middle of the show, then go back to where you were before or the "right now" option which snaps you to the most recent track
[07:04:44] <necromancer> it's pretty huge though i don't think i'd be able to develop it on my own
[07:05:04] <troubleman> allow me to rephrase
[07:05:20] <necromancer> if anyone out there steals this idea, please /msg me and hire me because i'd rather work on it than run the ship
[07:05:35] * necromancer doesn't have the capital or connections to start a company
[07:05:57] <xrated> Okay, so, I stole your idea
[07:06:00] <xrated> and named it soundcloud
[07:06:47] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/bT5R4/ (using jQuery Cloud Zoom) - can somebody help me find the bug that's causing 1px of the entire right side of the zoomed image to get cut off?
[07:06:50] <troubleman> I tried "adjustX: -1" but that also pushed the left side 1px further away. Can't have that.
[07:06:53] <troubleman> My friend Eviltwin pointed out that the problem might be that 550/315 = 1.746 and 840/480 = 1.75. So I tried with matching ratios, unfortunately to no avail: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/bT5R4/
[07:06:57] <troubleman> I contacted the jQuery Cloud Zoom author. He figured it might be a minor rounding error bug. So I figured I'd ask y'all for help to maybe speed up the process.
[07:07:00] <troubleman> If you help us out, I'll let you borrow my beach hut in Ambryn (French Polynesia) for about a month or so: http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ambryn/interesting/show/
[07:07:01] <diverdude> necromancer, it sounds very nice
[07:07:21] <necromancer> thanks diverdude :)
[07:07:24] <Eviltwin> troubleman: http://jsfiddle.net/bT5R4/10/
[07:07:51] <djnewbie> Eviltwin: got it, i  have to bind the code to disable the button to the submits instead of defining a class based click function, and manually calling the submit afterward. thx
[07:08:27] <diverdude> necromancer, i will most definitly dive into FAYE for my task here
[07:09:44] <Tomashe> hey guys
[07:09:45] <necromancer> diverdude: yeah the reason why i wanted to use XMPP for my thing is performance, since a lot of data is being carried over it. but for simple pub/sub messaging, Faye is totally what you need. a lot of reason why pub/sub hasn't taken off as quickly as it should have is because it was cumbersome and annoying to set up
[07:10:00] <Tomashe> http://pastie.org/private/a9vycpprewizj9yqimavra why the data= is undefined?
[07:10:41] <necromancer> Tomashe: data is scoped improperly
[07:10:43] <troubleman> Eviltwin: daaaaaaaaaaamn!
[07:10:47] <troubleman> what did you do? :D
[07:10:58] <Tomashe> so what should i do? how can i retrive it
[07:11:02] <necromancer> Tomashe: when you define a variable as a function argument, it is only available in the definition for that function
[07:11:27] <Tomashe> but i run the function data = GetOp($(this).val());
[07:11:31] <Eviltwin> troubleman: Lines 121 & 122 and 127 & 128
[07:11:37] <Eviltwin> I added a +1 in there
[07:11:39] <Eviltwin> http://pastebin.com/FhEwajNa
[07:11:42] <Tomashe> shouldnt it put the retuned data inside the new data var ?
[07:12:48] <necromancer> Tomashe: https://gist.github.com/1560461
[07:13:12] <troubleman> amazing stuff man..
[07:13:20] <troubleman> EVERYBODY GIVE IT UP FOR EVILTWIN!!!!!!
[07:13:27] * troubleman makes wild party noises
[07:13:31] <Tomashe> yes this is what i did at start but i want to do it with outside function, and want to understand what i did wrong and how to solve it for future
[07:13:32] <necromancer> Tomashe: $.post/$.ajax is asynchronous. you have to design your application so that it embraces this asynchronous nature
[07:13:34] * troubleman runs up next to Eviltwin and poses in front of the cam
[07:14:40] <necromancer> Tomashe: `return data` in your pastie returns the var data, but it's in the callback. so it returns to wherever the callback is executed, which doesn't get saved to a variable
[07:14:52] <troubleman> Eviltwin: please accept http://www.zshare.net/download/552763591f4802ce/ as a token of my appreciation for your support
[07:14:59] <necromancer> Tomashe: you're expecting the value of GetOp() to be `data`, which it won't be because there's a nested function in there
[07:15:28] <Tomashe> i c
[07:15:32] <Eviltwin> troubleman: I accept contributions to my beer fund here: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255 :P
[07:15:49] <troubleman> chuckles
[07:15:54] <necromancer> Tomashe: what would make sense to do in this case is declare `var data;` before you make the POST, then set `data = response` in the callback, THEN `return data` in GetOp
[07:16:05] <necromancer> Tomashe: the problem is, GetOp() will execute and finish before $.post() finishes
[07:16:08] <necromancer> so you can't do that either
[07:16:10] <DynamicFail> I have a system I work with that is configured with an xml file currently hand modified. I wanted to build a sexy configuration tool with jquery for a drag and drop style configuration. However I'm a little confused on how to successfully handle setting up the Page initially based on the XML file and then how I would rewrite the xml file based on how it was modified after the page was complete. Any suggestions on where to look for inspiration?
[07:17:32] <ilrisopatrone> any idea why does the "menu" section flickrs when stuck on to the top? http://jsfiddle.net/A5mxh/1/
[07:17:34] <Eviltwin> troubleman: Tell the author he owes me $30 for my time :P
[07:18:08] <Eviltwin> ilrisopatrone: I don't see any flickering
[07:18:38] <ilrisopatrone> Eviltwin: hmm sorry, i meant why does it goes behind the black bar, while it should just stick there :(
[07:18:40] <troubleman> i will for sure =))
[07:19:16] <ilrisopatrone> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/A5mxh/2/ now it will be strange
[07:19:28] <troubleman> "Bug fix by this dude called Eviltwin. He says you owe him $30 for his time: http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255"
[07:19:54] <necromancer> Tomashe: https://gist.github.com/1560461 is what i'd do. (i edited the gist)
[07:21:12] <Eviltwin> ilrisopatrone: I can't find any references for this plugin. Have you tried? https://github.com/kuzeko/StickyHeaders
[07:21:37] <ilrisopatrone> Eviltwin: I'll take a look at it right now, thanks!
[07:25:32] <Zogot> ilrisopatrone: any reason your not using position fixed instead of js?
[07:25:51] <Eviltwin> Zogot: Ho would you do it with just CSS?
[07:26:09] <Eviltwin> It needs to switch from normal positioning to fixed when you scroll to it
[07:26:52] <Zogot> ah, i didn't read up the logs on what exactly he was aiming for.  But doesn't bootstrap do the same?
[07:27:30] <DynamicFail> Eviltwin, Do you know of any examples of something web related that reads an xml file allows the user to modify things then writes an xml file bsed on those modifications?
[07:27:56] <Eviltwin> "web related"?
[07:29:04] <DynamicFail> Eviltwin, Well I figured Jquery is great for the actual visual representation of the file and the modification
[07:29:14] <DynamicFail> but I have trouble on how to handle the actual data.
[07:29:38] <DynamicFail> initial generation of the layout and then somehow writing an xml file based on div structure
[07:30:44] <mocas_> hi,
[07:31:01] <mocas_> how can I select all images inside in a A
[07:31:09] <mocas_> ('a.img') ?
[07:31:21] <Eviltwin> mocas_: It's a CSS selector
[07:31:32] <Eviltwin> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#pattern-matching
[07:32:28] <Eviltwin> a.img means an A tag with class "img"
[07:33:29] <ilrisopatrone> Zogot: I'll have a search bar on top, and then as you scroll down, a slideshow, and then the header sticks to the search bar and content goes under it
[07:33:49] <mocas_> so it? ('a img')
[07:33:51] <mocas_> I guess
[07:34:00] <Eviltwin> Yes
[07:34:08] <mocas_> thks Eviltwin
[07:41:23] <ShadowChancellor> hey i'm trying to use the .on() method to handle certain elements that get loaded into the page after the document is ready
[07:41:50] <ShadowChancellor> but it seems that .on('load', <selector> … doesn't do the trick
[07:42:13] <ShadowChancellor> is there a different eventType than 'load' that can be used?
[07:42:40] <Eviltwin> I don't believe load events bubble
[07:42:52] <Eviltwin> So I don't believe you can use the selector with them
[07:42:58] <James13433> I have about 4 or 5 values in a form, that when the div is hidden I don't want to be submitted, is there anyway I can stop the submitting?
[07:43:59] <ShadowChancellor> would $(<selector>).on('load', <callback>… work then?
[07:44:03] <NoiseEee> James13433: make is disabled
[07:44:24] <NoiseEee> James13433: but if you don't want a hidden input submitted,  why is it even in your form?
[07:44:24] <James13433> make what is diabled?
[07:44:38] <NoiseEee> James13433: sorry i misunderstood
[07:44:48] <Eviltwin> ShadowChancellor: Yes but it would only bind to events that exist currently
[07:45:19] <NoiseEee> James13433: have your submit function check to see if the div is hidden, and if so, stop the submit event
[07:45:20] <James13433> NoiseEee basically those values should only be shown when a user is adding a seperate item, and the values set the config of that item.
[07:45:35] <James13433> NoiseEee but I want some of the values still.
[07:46:09] <NoiseEee> James13433: sorry im confused by what you want, but if you don't want hidden form fields 'submitted', mark the inputs disabled
[07:47:38] <ShadowChancellor> EvilTwin: What would be the best way to bind functions to elements that don't yet exist when they are loaded? Can you use on() for that? Or is there a better method I'm not considering?
[07:47:55] <Eviltwin> ShadowChancellor: There is no way to bind functions to elements that don't exist
[07:48:40] <ShadowChancellor> Eviltwin: lol well, you just saved me a lot of time trying to figure that one out :)
[07:48:58] <Eviltwin> .on has a syntax that seems like it does that
[07:49:14] <Eviltwin> $(document).on("click", "a", function() { alert("Hi") });
[07:49:18] <agabel_> I'm having trouble getting json data from a remote url.  Can someone take a look at my code to see what I'm doing wrong?
[07:49:19] <Eviltwin> If you do that
[07:49:30] <Eviltwin> When you click on an <A> tag (even if it didn't exist when you made that call)
[07:49:35] <Eviltwin> It will cause the alert to show
[07:49:42] <Eviltwin> But it uses event bubbling
[07:49:49] <Eviltwin> And binds to the click event on the document
[07:49:58] <Eviltwin> The "load" event doesn't bubble
[07:50:08] <Eviltwin> So it won't work with that syntax
[07:50:43] <xckpd7> question: instead of having to manually capture every input inside of a form with jQuery, is there a way to get jQuery to capture any data that would have been submitted to the server regularly? basically all inputs except submit in a form (because I don't want to have to loop through every input... there must be an easier way)
[07:51:00] <jeffsmykil> stupid IE 7 and it's stupid float bug
[07:51:05] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: see ?.serialize and see ?.serializeArray
[07:51:05] <bot-t> xckpd7, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[07:51:06] <bot-t> xckpd7, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[07:51:24] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin can you hatch a plot to kill IE 7 off?
[07:51:27] <CrazyThinker> Is there any alternatives to jquery templates
[07:51:31] <ShadowChancellor> Eviltwin: Thanks for the explanation. It makes a lot more sense now why it won't work!
[07:51:44] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: commendations
[07:51:48] <xrated> CrazyThinker, there are a few javascript-based templating solutions
[07:52:05] <xrated> Twitter just releases hogan.js
[07:52:08] <xrated> released*
[07:52:28] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I just throw up a "This browser is not supported" on anything IE
[07:52:39] <xrated> Eviltwin, you're kidding right? o.O
[07:52:59] <Eviltwin> Yes
[07:53:09] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: I have this stupid float bug
[07:53:28] <Eviltwin> Have you dropped in #css?
[07:53:40] <jeffsmykil> you have been in there right?
[07:53:43] <xckpd7> jeffsmykil: yeah... #css
[07:53:44] <jeffsmykil> because I did
[07:53:53] <jeffsmykil> but if you have been in there you know why i asked that
[07:54:01] <xckpd7> ask again
[07:54:05] <xckpd7> in #css
[07:54:14] <Eviltwin> A friend of mine is in there sometimes
[07:54:22] <Eviltwin> He was rapid fire helping like I do in here
[07:54:23] <agabel_> http://jsbin.com/esukij/5     This is giving me a parseerror.  Can someone explain why please?
[07:55:38] <Eviltwin> agabel_: Can you throw that in a jsFiddle? For some reason JS Bins never work for me?
[07:55:44] <agabel_> sure
[07:56:48] <agabel_> http://jsfiddle.net/5WChE/
[08:00:13] <andrew9183> agabel: it doesn't look like the server is of content-type /json
[08:00:21] <andrew9183> just text/html;
[08:00:23] <Eviltwin> I don't think it supports JSONP
[08:00:39] <danzik17> Eviltwin: it does, just not with the callback "callback"
[08:00:47] <danzik17> agabel_: try adding jsonp: "cb" to your ajax call
[08:01:39] <agabel_> danzik17: ok that gives me a success message at least
[08:01:49] <ghinda> did anybody try this out? https://github.com/crystal88/jquery.observable any performance hits? seems to turn each obj into function
[08:02:01] <agabel_> danzik17: where did you get that cb from?
[08:02:26] <danzik17> agabel_: the docs.  http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/documentation.html
[08:02:30] <Eviltwin> Also, see ?alert
[08:02:30] <bot-t> Also, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[08:03:00] <Eviltwin> agabel_: JSONP requires a callback function of some kind
[08:03:22] <agabel_> oh wow. I can't believe i missed that.  Thank you
[08:03:25] <ilrisopatrone> Eviltwin: that plugin you linked me to is almost what I need. The only difference is that it creates a new element at the top instead of just sticking it. Do you know if its possible to use it other way?
[08:03:54] <Eviltwin> Personally, I think copying is a better solution
[08:04:03] <Salah> Is there a way to use prototype alongside jquery without using jquerys no-conflict? (does prototype have a no-conflict mode?)
[08:04:05] <Eviltwin> Otherwise the height of the content changes
[08:05:12] <Eviltwin> Salah: I'm not sure but you can always do window.$ = window.jQuery to make the $ be jQuery (as long as jQuery is loaded)
[08:05:42] <ilrisopatrone> Eviltwin: hmm i see, looks like ill just have to change the css then, ill give it a try
[08:07:34] <Salah> Eviltwin, yes but I simply need to make a request to prototype, but $ refers to jquery. (99% of the code is written in jquery, but there is always one smartass that just have to mess it up). So I need to make 1 simple request to prototype
[08:07:35] <ringocub> Hey guys, are there any known issues with JQuery .css method and teh web tool kit?
[08:08:06] <James13433> NoiseEee decided best way will be to unset all the values within that div onclick, thanks for your help
[08:08:26] <Eviltwin> Salah: If you do window.$ = window.jQuery after both libraries have loaded, you should be able to use $ or jQuery to refer to jQuery and Prototype to refer to Prototype
[08:08:34] <NoiseEee> James13433: np :)
[08:09:36] <NoiseEee> James13433: fwiw, if those values are something only for JS, there's no harm in adding <script>var importantValues = {"name":"rob","age":22};     and just hitting up the JS instead of putting things in a form that at the end of the day, probably don't belong there
[08:11:09] <Salah> Eviltwin, I tried, but it gives me the error "Prototype is not a function" (this may be the wrong channel, but the prototype channel is almost dead)
[08:11:34] <Eviltwin> Salah: I don't work with Prototype so I can't help you, sorry
[08:11:46] <Salah> Eviltwin, thanks anyway :)
[08:11:55] <Odin1> hi there
[08:12:31] <Odin1> i have a question — is it possible to store templates for jquery template plugin in external file?
[08:13:02] <James13433> just one problem, I need to delay the default action untill the values are cleared.
[08:13:11] <CrazyThinker> xrated, have you used dust?
[08:13:22] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: .serialize() will work for posting as well?
[08:13:33] <xckpd7> like POST instead of GET
[08:14:03] <James13433> event.preventDefault(); prvents it but how do I run it again when im done.
[08:14:15] <xrated> CrazyThinker, no
[08:14:29] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Uh...
[08:14:30] <NoiseEee> James13433: d.geBID('formID').submit();
[08:14:33] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: nevermind I'll try to figure this out, thanks
[08:14:46] <NoiseEee> mind my crappy short forms
[08:15:31] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4
[08:15:55] <danzik17> Odin1: yes.  you'll need to just use ajax or something like requirejs' text plugin to load the template.
[08:17:23] <andrew9183> is jquery templating going to be supported in future releases?  i just read it was decided it wasn't going to be put past beta
[08:17:38] <tcurdt> any jquery mobile people here?
[08:18:02] <Eviltwin> tcurdt: #jquerymobile
[08:18:05] <Eviltwin> It's in the topic
[08:18:05] <Odin1> danzik17: how fast is it? i'm writing a local application that is running  in webkit  withing the Qt application
[08:18:20] <Odin1> so all files will be stored locally
[08:18:22] <danzik17> andrew9183: no, it's a deprecated plugin.  should probably use something else for new projects.
[08:18:25] <tcurdt> Eviltwin: sorry ... was hidden
[08:18:28] <tcurdt> thx
[08:18:38] <danzik17> Odin1: dunno, try it =P
[08:19:44] <James13433> Grr
[08:20:17] <Odin1> danzik17: thanks. once it's not supported anymore, what alternatives do we have?
[08:21:22] <danzik17> Odin1: there's plenty of results if you look on google ( more than i know off the top of my head ).  personally, i'll be using either hogan.js or in the future handlebars.js .
[08:22:15] <ilrisopatrone> Eviltwin: Do you think it's possible to center the menu div? http://jsfiddle.net/A5mxh/3/ Since it's position is fixed, I can't do margin: 0 auto 0 auto;
[08:22:52] <Odin1> danzik17: ok, thanks. i googled first :) but the only adequate thing was this jquery plugin. ok. i'll try this two. thanks
[08:23:41] <Eviltwin> ilrisopatrone: Sounds like a #css issue
[08:24:17] <ilrisopatrone> Eviltwin: that's true, ill head there ;)
[08:25:42] <James13433> For some reason e.preventDefault() doesnt seem to want too do anything :/
[08:26:53] <Eviltwin> James13433: Bet you 100:1 it's because you're not using it right or because your listener's not actually getting fired
[08:26:55] <James13433> does it need to be high up? like in the head?
[08:27:35] <James13433> Eviltwin, well it is because it does the other stuff I need, just afterwards.
[08:29:29] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ James13433

[08:30:18] <tokam> I am having problems with a jquery effect on IE 8 at this page https://www.seolista.de/user/register
[08:30:34] <tokam> if you select Umsatzsteuerpflicht : ja not all fields are shown, why is that?
[08:50:47] <AdvoWork> if ive got <label for="stock"></label> how come: $( '#stock' ).parent().find( 'label' ).text(stock); wouldnt work?
[08:51:10] <jedimind> crosspost: hey guys, can anyone recommend a tool for doing some metrics testing between javascript and css3 animations ?
[08:51:40] <tfitts> does anyone know if there is a simple way to serialize a form and implode arrays so I can have ?checkbox=1,2,3 instead of ?checkbox[]=1&checkbox[]=2&checkbox[]3
[09:00:09] <fission6> anyone here use any web app js frameworks, a la spine batman backbone knockout  along with jquery
[09:01:11] <t4nkd> hey jquery -- is there a resource for patching .map() to work with IE <9?
[09:01:49] <erichynds> jquery's .map?
[09:01:50] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[09:02:01] <t4nkd> yapp
[09:02:12] <Eviltwin> jQuery's .map does work with IE <9...
[09:02:40] <t4nkd> Weird, it doesn't work here; maybe I did something else wrong? https://gist.github.com/9160ca0c1ff3dec14c25
[09:02:55] <t4nkd> I've just read in about 4-5 different SO posts that .map doesn't work with IE <9
[09:02:58] <Jon47> eviltwin i think they test pretty thoroughly in versions < 9, are you sure about that?
[09:03:05] <t4nkd> And I can confirm that, the above function works in IE 9
[09:03:18] <erichynds> t4nkd: return a.id == i ? a : null;
[09:03:39] <t4nkd> Okie, I'll try that, thanks
[09:03:58] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: You probably want to see ?.grep for this job
[09:03:58] <bot-t1> t4nkd, jQuery.grep(array, function, [invert]): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[09:04:13] <Eviltwin> As it's pretty much exactly what you're trying to do
[09:05:28] <t4nkd> Okay, I'll give that a shot then
[09:05:52] <t4nkd> erichynds: appreciate the ternary
[09:07:06] <Eviltwin> erichynds: I think it may need to actually be "undefined" not "null"
[09:07:13] <erichynds> nah, it's null
[09:07:14] <Eviltwin> To do what he wants
[09:08:06] <t4nkd> Hrm, I get the same console error with .grep() as .map()
[09:08:23] <t4nkd> And again, it's only IE <9, every other browser works as intended
[09:08:36] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: What if none of them match?
[09:08:46] <t4nkd> In only IE <9?
[09:08:51] <t4nkd> I'm testing the same data
[09:08:52] <fission6> Eviltwin: do you use any other libraries or frameworks in your dev work?
[09:09:07] <erichynds> t4nkd: grep/map return an array, not an obj
[09:09:14] <erichynds> oh, i missed the [0]
[09:09:16] <erichynds> nevermind me
[09:09:18] <t4nkd> yeah :(
[09:09:29] <vdclouis> could someone help me out with a school mini-project? http://jsfiddle.net/uWYjH/1/
[09:09:42] <t4nkd> I mean, I guess I could use jlinq?
[09:10:46] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: Throw an alert in the .map/.grep if it matches
[09:10:48] <Eviltwin> And see if any do
[09:10:52] <t4nkd> okie
[09:12:37] <fission6> Eviltwin: anything? or do you just use js and jquery
[09:12:51] <Eviltwin> fission6: Sorry, missed the question
[09:12:55] <Eviltwin> Mostly just JS and jQuery
[09:13:28] <fatninja> I have a link, <a href="/test">Test</a> , how can I use jquery to confirm my request something like Are you sure you want to go there ?
[09:13:50] <tfitts> fatninja: have you read any documentation on jquery?
[09:13:52] <fission6> hmm ok, i am considering backbonejs any thoughts Eviltwin
[09:14:10] <fatninja> tfitts: ok..
[09:14:12] <Eviltwin> I think it's a fantastic idea to try new things
[09:14:26] <udp> fatninja: bind to click, display your confirmation dialog, return false, navigate (or don't) on close of the confirmation dialog
[09:15:03] <Eviltwin> fission6: see ?.click
[09:15:04] <bot-t1> fission6, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[09:15:33] <Eviltwin> Err
[09:15:38] <t4nkd> Eviltwin: Erm, I think I'm messing this up: 'if (a.id == i) return alert("it does");'
[09:15:39] <Eviltwin> fatninja: see ?.click
[09:15:40] <bot-t1> fatninja, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[09:15:52] <fatninja> I am doing this
[09:16:07] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: if(a.id == i) { alert("it does"); return a; }
[09:16:08] <fission6> yeah
[09:16:13] <fatninja> $(location).attr('href',$(this).attr('href'));
[09:16:14] <fatninja> 	alert($(this).attr('href'));
[09:16:20] <fatninja> it shouldn't alert anything...
[09:16:23] <fatninja> but it does
[09:16:27] <LoreVTEC> Hi! can someone please tell me why my image is not fading in? Here is a test: http://jsfiddle.net/lorenzo/yu8yg/
[09:16:36] <fatninja> and if I think about it, it's not a good idea
[09:16:47] <Eviltwin> LoreVTEC: Talk to #css
[09:16:59] <Eviltwin> jQuery doesn't support CSS3 animations
[09:17:31] <LoreVTEC> but im just adding a class right?
[09:18:31] <LoreVTEC> i think the problem has to do with the fact that im adding the image to the dom, because if i do the same with an image that already exists it works

[09:26:20] <billwalton> i need to bind the keydown event (to check for tabs) in a plugin but cannot get anything but 'undefined' for the event object
[09:26:46] <billwalton> anybody got a link that might help
[09:26:53] <Eviltwin> billwalton: How'd you bind?
[09:27:48] <billwalton> $(document).keydown( function(event) {advanceOnTab() }  );
[09:28:09] <Eviltwin> And where are you trying to access the event?
[09:28:13] <billwalton> i also tried using $(document).on("keydown"...
[09:28:51] <billwalton> trying to access in the advanceOnTab() function
[09:29:03] <Eviltwin> But you're not passing it to the advanceOnTab function
[09:29:14] <billwalton> var advanceOnTab = function(event) {...}
[09:29:31] <Eviltwin> Do $(document).keydown(advanceOnTab) instead
[09:29:44] <billwalton> hmmmm....
[09:29:59] <z0ned> what's the best way to set a default value for a function arg?
[09:30:16] <billwalton> cool.  i'll try that.  thanks.
[09:30:50] <z0ned> myVar = myVar || defaultVal;    doesn't work if you pass in false
[09:30:52] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Do you undersatnd why this won't alert 2? http://jsfiddle.net/NHht2/
[09:31:21] <Eviltwin> z0ned: myVar = myVar !== undefined ? myVar : defaultVal
[09:31:37] <Eviltwin> Unless you're trying to set it to undefined

[09:31:42] <billwalton> Eviltwin:  still learning
[09:31:49] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ billwalton
[09:31:49] <bot-t1> billwalton, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:31:54] <Eviltwin> You definitely need to go through that then
[09:32:01] <Eviltwin> The first linl
[09:32:02] <Eviltwin> link*
[09:33:18] <billwalton> will do.  the parameter passing, or not, is unfamiliar
[09:33:33] <Eviltwin> Have you ever programmed before?
[09:33:41] <billwalton> oh yes
[09:33:45] <Eviltwin> What langauges?
[09:34:10] <billwalton> started in C, x86 assember
[09:34:24] <billwalton> been working in Ruby / Rails for the past 6 years
[09:34:24] <Eviltwin> So you know about passing arguments to functions?
[09:34:37] <billwalton> i thought i did
[09:35:02] <leo2007> In this call form $(function), is function invoked for each element?
[09:35:36] <Eviltwin> So lets say I have int foo(int i) { bar(); } int bar() { printf("%i\n", i); } int main() { foo(2); }
[09:35:36] <gnarf> leo2007: $( fn ) is an alias for $( document ).ready( function )
[09:35:39] <Eviltwin> What happens?
[09:35:59] <leo2007> gnarf: thank you ;)
[09:36:02] <Eviltwin> leo2007: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[09:36:13] <Eviltwin> leo2007: All the things the $() can do
[09:36:50] <leo2007> Eviltwin: thanks, although the page takes too long  to load.
[09:37:03] <Eviltwin> leo2007: So read it once and remember :P
[09:37:12] <leo2007> done!
[09:37:45] <Eviltwin> So what does jQuery(function($) { ... }) do?
[09:39:04] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Have an answer?
[09:39:09] <Eviltwin> Try compiling it if you don't know
[09:39:20] <Eviltwin> billwalton: With <stdio.h>
[09:39:58] <billwalton> Eviltwin: sorry.  no, i don't know yet
[09:40:09] <Eviltwin> That's C code
[09:40:16] <Eviltwin> int foo(int i) { bar(); } int bar() { printf("%i\n", i); } int main() { foo(2); }
[09:40:44] <Eviltwin> I thought you did C before
[09:40:51] <billwalton> years ago
[09:41:04] <Eviltwin> :/
[09:41:09] <Eviltwin> This is pretty basic
[09:41:41] <billwalton> bar takes no argument
[09:41:47] <billwalton> that code should fail
[09:41:47] <peterschmidler> Happy new year. Is there an easy way to switch two links? http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/hhZtM/
[09:41:52] <Eviltwin> Correct
[09:42:05] <Eviltwin> Because "i" is undeclared in that scope
[09:42:09] <billwalton> correct
[09:42:25] <Eviltwin> billwalton: Same thing happens here in JavaScript: http://jsfiddle.net/NHht2/
[09:42:36] <Eviltwin> bar takes no arguments
[09:42:39] <billwalton> context works differently in javascript, i thought
[09:42:39] <Eviltwin> And tries to reference "i"
[09:43:07] <Eviltwin> That context only applies to functions defined inside other functions
[09:43:12] <Eviltwin> Something you can't do in C
[09:43:14] <billwalton> which is why i'm confused about the recommendation you made
[09:43:27] <billwalton> the event is not passed in
[09:43:35] <Eviltwin> If you aren't defining functions inside other functions, it works exactly like C does
[09:43:41] <billwalton> yet 'in' is where I need it
[09:43:42] <Eviltwin> There's a global scope and a local scope
[09:43:52] <nicholasschulz> how do you create a function in jQuery?
[09:44:10] <Eviltwin> ?jsisjs @ nicholasschulz
[09:44:10] <bot-t1> nicholasschulz, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[09:44:29] <Eviltwin> Or if you're asking about adding $("span").foobarzed()
[09:44:32] <Eviltwin> See this: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[09:45:54] <peterschmidler> Sorry, the fiddle was not saved properly. Again: can I switch two links? http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/hhZtM/
[09:47:06] <peterschmidler> How can I get the third link?
[09:47:39] <Eviltwin> peterschmidler: Are they in some sort of container? Do they have IDs?
[09:48:10] <peterschmidler> They are in the same container but have no ids http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/hhZtM/7/
[09:48:14] <nicholasschulz> Why doesnt this work? http://jsfiddle.net/BvdwE/
[09:48:33] <billwalton> Eviltwin: thank you. not passing in the event element, and binding rather than invoking in the init function, worked.
[09:49:21] <billwalton> i'm not sure i understand why all the examples i googled up explicitly passed the event object though
[09:49:50] <billwalton> http://api.jquery.com/keydown/
[09:49:53] <billwalton> for example
[09:50:15] <billwalton> more studyin' to do, i reckon

[10:40:55] <blimey> hi eviltwin yes, much better way of explaining it.
[10:41:07] <Eviltwin> peterschmidler: The space disappears because there's technically a text node between them that doesn't move

[10:45:55] <Eviltwin> It creates a new version and adds a number at the end
[10:45:59] <Eviltwin> You need to share that new link
[10:46:11] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: Or "Set as base"
[10:47:15] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/MwNTZ/
[10:47:20] <LekeFly> Anyone that could take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/KfSys/ I want just one "inner div" to move at click
[10:48:06] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: Still no "Down"?
[10:48:32] <eternity13> how do i trigger alert() 5seconds after $(window).load() ?
[10:48:36] <Eviltwin> Or done better: http://jsfiddle.net/MwNTZ/5/
[10:48:47] <Eviltwin> Sorry, this: http://jsfiddle.net/MwNTZ/4/
[10:48:53] <Eviltwin> Was the minor change you needed to make
[10:49:03] <Eviltwin> This is a much better design though: http://jsfiddle.net/MwNTZ/5/
[10:49:20] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: Nice one...
[10:49:33] <Eviltwin> eternity13: setTimeout
[10:50:43] <blimey> eviltwin a:replace fixes[id] with newFixes b:do nothing  c: add(push)  newFixes[id] to fixes array
[10:50:56] <eternity13> yea thanks
[10:51:02] <catcher> Any ideas why jquery ui's autocomplete isn't trying to do any matching from a json source, but matches fine with a local array of strings?
[10:51:47] <catcher> when I use json, it shows me all results regardless of input.
[10:53:12] <Eviltwin> LekeFly: http://jsfiddle.net/KfSys/1/
[10:53:54] <blimey> catcher, maybe worth checking if the arrays look exactly the same if you have both local and json and inspect in firebug?
[10:54:55] <blimey> sorry catcher, i misunderstood
[10:55:52] <niloy> hey guys, wassup
[10:57:06] <catcher> blimey, not a bad thought - but alas even formatting exactly the same makes all results pop up
[10:57:23] <LekeFly> Eviltwin: Thanks! comparing to see what i did wrong now : )
[10:57:49] <Eviltwin> blimey: http://jsfiddle.net/bBsxf/1/
[10:57:54] <laughahol> i'm setting the document title to blah ... but it's not saving in the cpe browser
[10:57:58] <laughahol> anyone know?
[10:58:00] <laughahol> why?
[10:58:16] <niloy> cpe?
[10:58:31] <laughahol> customer premises equipment
[10:58:44] <laughahol> i.e. ff or chrome or ie
[10:59:00] <laughahol> but i know when i have gmail, it saves the (1)
[10:59:04] <niloy> what code are u using?
[10:59:31] <laughahol> document.title = 'blah' ... but also if they title is already set then i'm directly setting <title>blah</title>
[10:59:34] <laughahol> on load
[11:00:08] <niloy> try document.head.title
[11:00:15] <Eviltwin> blimey: Although if they all have deviceid's and the ordering for fixes doesn't matter, I'd suggest doing this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/bBsxf/2/
[11:00:41] <Eviltwin> (Obviously the order of newFixes matters)
[11:02:53] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: Why does this work var active = $("a.active"); active.insertAfter(active.next()); and this doesn't $("a.active").insertAfter(active.next());
[11:03:08] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: Sorry, I know...
[11:04:14] <Eviltwin> You don't define active in the second
[11:04:24] <Eviltwin> You can do $("a.active").insertAfter($("a.active").next());
[11:04:31] <Eviltwin> But then it looks up a.active twice unnecessarily
[11:04:42] <laughahol> niloy, that doesn't evne change the title any more
[11:05:28] <Matiasu> Hey guys :)
[11:06:06] <Matiasu> $("<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js\"></script>").load(function() {alert("done!");}).appendTo("head");
[11:06:19] <Matiasu> why it doesn't show the alert?
[11:06:39] <Matiasu> it does load the script but it doesn't executes the callback
[11:07:29] <dabear> ?getscript @ Matiasu
[11:07:29] <bot-t1> Matiasu, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[11:07:41] <Matiasu> oh, nice
[11:07:50] <Matiasu> ok, but now I want to know why it doesn't work
[11:08:20] <dabear> because the load event is something different
[11:08:25] <dabear> ?load
[11:08:25] <bot-t1> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[11:09:13] <jeffsmykil> is it really this hard to position a datepicker window, or am I just that stupid
[11:09:14] <Matiasu> "The load event is sent to an element when it and all sub-elements have been completely loaded. This event can be sent to any element associated with a URL: images, scripts, frames, iframes, and the window object."
[11:09:34] <Matiasu> dabear, it seems it should work anyway
[11:09:54] <dabear> Matiasu: no
[11:09:57] <Matiasu> in the example shown there it says "As soon as the image has been loaded, the handler is called."
[11:10:02] <Matiasu> ok, I'm getting it wrong then
[11:10:15] <dabear> .load is for things like <img src>
[11:10:17] <peterschmidler> How could I rewrite this so that it works: $("a"):last.index()
[11:10:28] <dabear> where you have an image that downloads async
[11:10:38] <dabear> peterschmidler: .last()
[11:10:40] <Matiasu> but... This event can be sent to any element associated with a URL: images, SCRIPTS, frames, iframes, and the window object.
[11:10:45] <blimey> Eviltwin, for each newFix object compare it's deviceID property i.e."704004" to each fixes deviceID property, if it finds a match then replace the correct fixes object with newFixes one, if it doesn't find a match then add the newFixes object to the array for fixes ibjects
[11:10:49] <Matiasu> it says it works with "scripts"
[11:11:13] <peterschmidler> I'd like to know the position of the last element or the amount of elements.
[11:11:20] <ngharo> Matiasu: script tags are actually stripped out and eval, they dont actually get put into the DOM so i dont think events can be bound to them
[11:11:37] <peterschmidler> dabear: $("a").last.index() does not work either
[11:11:52] <ngharo> Matiasu: use $.getScript
[11:11:53] <dabear> peterschmidler: I says .last()
[11:12:11] <dabear> said*
[11:12:28] <peterschmidler> dabear: I heard but I don't get it
[11:12:43] <dabear> you said .last.index()
[11:12:49] <dabear> there is a difference there
[11:12:50] <peterschmidler> dabear: I'm tired, sorry.
[11:12:59] <Matiasu> I will ngharo, but I wanted to add CSS files dynamically as well, now I think I will have the same problem. I will try anyway, thanks
[11:13:03] <Matiasu> thanks both
[11:13:23] <Eviltwin> blimey: Version 4 does exactly that
[11:13:34] <Eviltwin> blimey: Version 5 uses an object instead to make the look up faster
[11:15:09] <rubial> i am editing a blogger template using jquery plugin
[11:15:11] <rubial> if (window.location.href == "http://www.adilxaid.blogspot.com") alert("yooo"); else alert("noooo");
[11:15:22] <rubial> this code always alerts nooo
[11:15:27] <LekeFly> Hmm.. Eviltwin say i need the button outside of slidemarginleft..  i tryed to solve it with css but no luck.. is it even possible? :P http://jsfiddle.net/KfSys/1/
[11:15:53] <Eviltwin> Outside where?
[11:15:54] <rubial> what can be the problem
[11:15:59] <Eviltwin> Above? Below?
[11:16:12] <rubial> the location url and the string is exactly same
[11:16:16] <LekeFly> Eviltwin: Right :P
[11:16:16] <Eviltwin> LekeFly: Get it to look the way you want and I'll see if I can help you with the jQuery
[11:16:23] <LekeFly> Alright
[11:17:01] <Trudko> guys I want to change name of subject why this did not work ? http://jsfiddle.net/zCjQZ/
[11:17:08] <Eviltwin> rubial: window.location.href == "http://www.adilxaid.blogspot.com/"
[11:17:36] <Trudko> I have tried attr also but same thing
[11:18:01] <Eviltwin> Trudko: $("t") is not how you get an element with ID "t"
[11:18:06] <Trudko> lol
[11:18:11] <Trudko> of course i dont
[11:18:14] <Eviltwin> Trudko: It uses CSS selectors: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#pattern-matching
[11:18:28] <Trudko> yes I know that I forgot # omg.
[11:18:34] <Trudko> well this is embarassing
[11:18:47] <Trudko> and should I use attr or prop?
[11:19:04] <Eviltwin> Depends on whether you want to change the attribute or the property :P
[11:19:04] <rubial> Eviltwin: thanks buddy .. i am such a noob
[11:19:14] <Eviltwin> Trudko: see ?.attr and see ?.prop for more info about when to use which
[11:19:15] <bot-t1> Trudko, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[11:19:15] <bot-t1> Trudko, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[11:19:56] <Matiasu> ok, it works perfectly well with $.getScript, now I have the same problem with CSS files!
[11:20:47] <Matiasu> $("<style href=\"http://static.jquery.com/files/rocker/css/screen.css\"></style>").load(function() {alert("foo")}).appendTo("head")
[11:21:03] <Eviltwin> Matiasu: ... <link href="..."> ...
[11:21:11] <LekeFly> Eviltwin: Does this make any sence? http://jsfiddle.net/KfSys/1/ :P
[11:21:44] <Eviltwin> LekeFly: That looks exactly the same as what I sent you
[11:21:45] <Matiasu> arghhh. I was using <style>code</style> and then I added an href with a URL to show you here lol
[11:21:46] <Matiasu> never mind
[11:22:14] <LekeFly> Eviltwin: Ops http://jsfiddle.net/KfSys/2/
[11:22:29] <Eviltwin> LekeFly: Why is one of these not like the other?
[11:22:37] <Matiasu> $("<link href=\"http://static.jquery.com/files/rocker/css/screen.css\" />").load(function() {alert("foo")}).appendTo("head")
[11:22:57] <LekeFly> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/KfSys/3/
[11:23:08] <Eviltwin> Is that actually where you want it?
[11:23:39] <LekeFly> Well the css is pretty basic once i have it outside of "slidemarginleft"
[11:23:43] <Eviltwin> K
[11:24:26] <hexasquid> Which is more correct? ( typeof obj.member === 'undefined' ) or ( typeof obj.member === undefined ) or does it not matter?
[11:24:32] <LekeFly> like it was before when i floated the button right the "inner" slided above the button.. height was like 30px
[11:24:59] <ddubs> 'undefined' is a string 'undefined' != undefined
[11:25:25] <Eviltwin> LekeFly: http://jsfiddle.net/KfSys/4/
[11:25:46] <Eviltwin> hexasquid: The second one is not only less correct, it's incorrect
[11:25:56] <Eviltwin> It will always be false
[11:26:01] <Eviltwin> typeof only returns a string
[11:26:19] <hexasquid> right so I'd compare a string to a string
[11:26:30] <Eviltwin> Correct
[11:26:36] <hexasquid> ty
[11:26:54] <hexasquid> makes a bunch of sense
[11:28:43] <d4red3vil> Hello, how can I select element when I have id of his child?
[11:29:09] <Eviltwin> $("#myid").parent()
[11:29:35] <d4red3vil> Tnx
[11:31:50] <digitalfiz> anyone know much about the validation plugin?
[11:32:31] <digitalfiz> I have a form that is wrapping a tabbed wizard and for some reason validation only validates the currently showing fields. I need it to validate for every tab.
[11:33:24] <someprimetime> how come when you click the << arrows, the area where the thumbnail appears is white instead of easing in like when you click the >> arrows? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/K9EYk/
[11:34:24] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: That's because these aren't symmetric
[11:34:33] <Eviltwin> With the left click, you actually need to move it then animate
[11:34:41] <someprimetime> ahh, right
[11:34:45] <someprimetime> cause it's being prepended, right?
[11:34:58] <someprimetime> therefore, nothing exists before it until that happens
[11:35:03] <Eviltwin> Yup
[11:35:14] <someprimetime> any suggestions on making that transition cleaner?
[11:35:20] <Eviltwin> The left one?
[11:35:56] <someprimetime> yes
[11:36:12] <elb0w> Anyone have anything they prefer other than facebox?
[11:36:27] <someprimetime> elb0w: try twitrectangle
[11:36:31] <someprimetime> ha jk ;)
[11:36:37] <elb0w> lol
[11:36:46] * elb0w totally wasnt googling that as you said it
[11:37:00] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/K9EYk/1/
[11:37:22] <`Korvin> Https://github.com/Koolvin/MineSweeper/blob/development/MineSweeper.js#l60-65 << doesn't work when you double click the text within the div, only when you click the empty space around the text
[11:37:30] <`Korvin> Any idea why?
[11:37:35] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: you evil genius, you. Exactly like that. ha! thanks :)
[11:37:56] <Eviltwin> `Korvin: Is this your code?
[11:37:59] <`Korvin> Yes
[11:38:33] <Eviltwin> `Korvin: Add a preventDefault on mousedown for the same element
[11:38:45] <`Korvin> Hmm
[11:38:52] <`Korvin> One sec
[11:39:12] <Eviltwin> Also I believe $('.block','.minefield') is slower than $('.minefield .block') and it's definitely slower than $('.minefield').find('.block')
[11:39:20] <Eviltwin> Not that it matters too much
[11:40:27] <`Korvin> 		$('.block').click(function(e){
[11:40:27] <`Korvin> 			e.preventDefault;
[11:40:27] <`Korvin> 		});
[11:40:28] <`Korvin> Didn't work
[11:40:40] <Eviltwin> I'm saying mousedown
[11:40:42] <`Korvin> Oh mousedown
[11:40:43] <`Korvin> Alright
[11:40:45] <gnarf> `Korvin: might help if you called preventDefault()
[11:41:04] <Eviltwin> It's e.preventDefault() not e.preventDefault
[11:41:10] <Eviltwin> To prevent default
[11:41:14] <`Korvin> Yeah
[11:41:17] <`Korvin> Didn't work either
[11:41:40] <`Korvin> $('.block div').mousedown(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); });
[11:41:56] <`Korvin> I tried both variations: $('.block') and $('.block div')
[11:43:16] <meoblast001> quick question
[11:43:29] <meoblast001> with Google Chrome.. is it possible to monitor functions added to jQuery
[11:43:41] <meoblast001> so i can detect when they're added, when removed, when changed, etc
[11:43:44] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/h2QUS/
[11:43:49] <gnarf> hey `Korvin - do you think you could call $(this) one more time in your code btw?
[11:43:56] <Eviltwin> meoblast001: Nope
[11:44:08] <meoblast001> dang, that could make things a lot harder
[11:44:11] <gnarf> the $() isn't free ;)
[11:44:13] <meoblast001> somehow, a function is being removed
[11:44:20] <Eviltwin> gnarf: No, but $(this) is cheap
[11:44:28] <gnarf> Eviltwin: but still - not free
[11:44:36] <Eviltwin> He's making Minesweeper...
[11:44:55] <`Korvin> Gnarf, I ran several tests caching and not caching, there was do difference below 1e9 iterations.....
[11:45:23] <jamieyg3> hi... i want to use jquery to remove a <tr> block... is this possible?
[11:45:50] <NoiseEee> jamieyg3: $(trReference).remove()
[11:46:03] * gnarf shrugs, ignore the best practice - whatever ;)
[11:46:07] <jamieyg3> thanks!
[11:46:32] <jamieyg3> my next question is a bit harder... how do i get a reference to this <tr> if it doesn't have a class or id?
[11:47:03] <NoiseEee> jamieyg3: by getting to it via the DOM, either as a parent/child of something you do know, or using .find() or any other means
[11:47:10] <`Korvin> Eviltwin, what were you displaying in that jsfiddle?
[11:47:15] <Eviltwin> jamieyg3: You need some information that's true for that <tr> and not true for the others
[11:47:18] <`Korvin> Both the same
[11:47:26] <jamieyg3> i think find is what im looking for, ill look into it thanks!
[11:47:40] <Eviltwin> `Korvin: One might get selected while the other won't
[11:47:49] <blimey> Eviltwin, thank you very much, exactly what I was trying to achieve.
[11:48:29] <jamieyg3> it has a unique image name in it <tr><td><img src='unique' /></td></tr> so i guess i can find that image and get it's parent, does it sound like im heading in the right direction?
[11:48:37] <`Korvin> But that still doesn't fix my problem
[11:48:41] <`Korvin> As these are working equally
[11:48:52] <gnarf> restate the problem?
[11:48:54] <`Korvin> I'll see if I can make a jsfiddle replicate my issue
[11:48:57] <`Korvin> One sec
[11:49:05] <Eviltwin> jamieyg3: Still not ideal but better I guess
[11:49:22] <jamieyg3> is there a better way? sorry im new to jquery
[11:52:09] <gnarf> jamieyg3: if you are clicking on something inside the <tr> you could use $( this ).closest( "tr" )
[11:52:29] <jamieyg3> no, its somewhere else on the page
[11:53:03] <gnarf> jamieyg3: okay, well how is the link generated?
[11:53:12] <jamieyg3> its not a link
[11:53:13] <gnarf> and / or the table?
[11:53:28] <gnarf> jamieyg3: ?demo
[11:53:40] <jamieyg3> its just a table row with an image... then somewhere else in the page i want to have jquery remove that table row
[11:53:40] <gnarf> ?demo @jamieyg3
[11:53:40] <bot-t1> jamieyg3, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[11:53:50] <jamieyg3> ok just a sec
[11:56:12] <fris> do all browsers support pjax? (push state + ajax) ? https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[11:56:21] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Improved: http://jsfiddle.net/K9EYk/2/

[11:56:59] <voronika> is that pbxphreak?
[11:57:02] <Eviltwin> fris: scroll down
[11:57:08] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: you thank have to do that
[11:57:12] <someprimetime> err h/o
[11:57:16] <someprimetime> what did i just say?!
[11:57:20] <someprimetime> thanks! you didn't have to do that
[11:57:32] <`Korvin> Eviltwin, I can't replicate, and I can't get it to work =[
[11:57:44] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: If you slow down the animation, you'll see on the version before, it actually jumped a bit before animating
[11:58:20] <fris> Eviltwin ahh missed that
[11:58:22] <Eviltwin> Because they have some spacing
[11:58:30] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: ahh i see what you're saying now
[11:58:42] <someprimetime> today i learned about using offset()
[11:58:47] <digitalfiz> how do i check if a block has a block inside it with a certain class?
[11:59:01] <digitalfiz> like if(my block has sub block.class)
[11:59:23] <Eviltwin> digitalfiz: http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[12:02:09] <jeffsmykil> can i give the buttonimage for ui datepicker an additional class?
[12:02:18] <geoid> greetz
[12:02:35] <peterschmidler> Thanks forum, good night.
[12:03:08] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[12:03:12] <Eviltwin> The options are listed there
[12:03:27] <geoid> http://pastie.org/3126858
[12:03:28] <geoid> How can I pass a variable to my HS.ui.Spinner method?
[12:06:07] <Eviltwin> geoid: http://pastie.org/3126869
[12:07:33] <Swimming_Bird> is there a way to detect if a click event happend on an element or any of its children?
[12:08:00] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: what do you think would be some good options to add to this carousel to make it more dynamic/modular? some options i'm thinking of include: only showing one more thumbnail when clicking right/left, showing the entire row when clicking right/left, the ability to add a url and grab the thumbnails from there and load them in, record mousedown time (if > X ms then speed up animation)
[12:08:02] <Swimming_Bird> or specifically bind to when a click event happens anywhere BUT an element or its children (with .delegate() or something)
[12:08:04] <geoid> Eviltwin genius :)
[12:08:20] <someprimetime> including, rather
[12:08:51] <someprimetime> geoid: Eviltwin is like the oksushi of #css
[12:12:59] <karega|aniasis> Is there anyway I can detect where my mouse is hovering all the way up to the body tag?
[12:13:32] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: There are already quite a few slideshow plugins for jQuery
[12:14:24] <digitalfiz> is there a selector for display: none?
[12:14:38] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: As for modularity, start by reading this: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[12:14:42] <Eviltwin> digitalfiz: There's :hidden
[12:14:50] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[12:14:54] <digitalfiz> for some reason the validator plugin only sets display to none instead of making the error elements go away
[12:15:13] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: true, this is more of a learning experience for me. and thanks! i have always wondering how to right a "true" plugin
[12:15:16] <digitalfiz> so i need to check for label.error and it doesn't have display: hidden
[12:15:35] <Eviltwin> $("label.error:not(:hidden)")
[12:15:50] <digitalfiz> ok cool ill try that
[12:16:06] <Eviltwin> Or I think $("label.error:visible")
[12:16:15] <digitalfiz> this is what i have right now
[12:16:23] <digitalfiz> $(".sidetab:has(.error)")
[12:16:25] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[12:16:29] <digitalfiz> as i am trying to get all the tabs with errors in them
[12:16:36] <Eviltwin> $(".sidetab:has(.error:visible)")
[12:16:46] <digitalfiz> ill try that thanks
[12:17:05] <digitalfiz> blast
[12:17:10] <digitalfiz> back to square one lol
[12:17:16] <Eviltwin> ?
[12:17:18] <karega|aniasis> Eviltwin, any ideas of howto determine whether my mouse is hovering
[12:17:19] <digitalfiz> it only works on the currently visible tab
[12:17:52] <Eviltwin> karega|aniasis: I usually see it done via something like var isHovering = false; $("#element").hover(function(){isHovering=true}else{isHovering=false});
[12:17:58] <Eviltwin> Then whenever you want to check, you just look at isHovering
[12:18:21] <Eviltwin> see ?.hover
[12:18:23] <bot-t1> .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[12:19:33] <te-brian> I have a table where I want 'guides' that show you the which row and column you are hovering.  Here is a simplified snippet from the actual app. http://jsfiddle.net/Zwmch/1/  .  The problem is that when you hover the contents of the tds, the event does not bubble up anymore.  Note: I have to use jQuery 1.3.x.
[12:19:38] <karega|aniasis> Eviltwin, but I have another element that is absolutely positioned where the mouse is.  I want to determine where the mouse is hover on element 'below' that element
[12:19:53] <Eviltwin> Oh, that's a different story
[12:20:23] <karega|aniasis> Eviltwin, I am using padolsey's zoomer and it creates a zoom element.  I want to get the element that is below that zoom element.
[12:20:28] <Eviltwin> karega|aniasis: You're going to bind to mousemove, use the event pageX and pageY and the element's .offset() and .width() and .height() to check
[12:20:51] <Eviltwin> I think you can figure out how to put those pieces together
[12:20:54] <karega|aniasis> Eviltwin, I figured that.
[12:21:18] <digitalfiz> Eviltwin: :css(display,none)
[12:21:26] <digitalfiz> but how do i do the opposite of that?
[12:21:33] <karega|aniasis> Is there an easy way to determine what element is in a coordinate rectangle?
[12:23:11] <digitalfiz> never mind bad suggestion from stack overflow lol
[12:23:28] <jamieyg3> how can i find a <td> with css "width:500px" in it?
[12:23:44] <jamieyg3> there is no class or id on this <td>
[12:23:54] <sphinxxx> anyone ever used an api for getting shipping labels for either ups or usps?
[12:24:26] <te-brian> Any ideas?  (see above)
[12:24:35] <Eviltwin> digitalfiz: :not(...)
[12:24:47] <Eviltwin> karega|aniasis: Pretty simple math
[12:24:56] <Eviltwin> te-brian: This is it with a proper .delegate: http://jsfiddle.net/Zwmch/2/
[12:25:41] <Eviltwin> And actually it works with yours too: http://jsfiddle.net/Zwmch/3/
[12:25:47] <te-brian> Eviltwin: Unforunately.. I can't use jQuery 1.7 or even 1.4 for that matter... if the problem is with the hacked delgation.. do you see a quick fix in the version I have?
[12:26:24] <te-brian> Eviltwin: wait.. what? whats the difference
[12:26:41] <Eviltwin> te-brian: I didn't know if my technique would work with your fake .delegate or not
[12:26:45] <Eviltwin> So I tried it with the real one first
[12:28:06] <te-brian> Eviltwin: ahh.. $(this) .. vs. $(e.target)
[12:28:06] <Eviltwin> Oh, do you mean the difference from your code?
[12:28:13] <te-brian> Eviltwin:  hmmm
[12:28:31] <Eviltwin> "this" inside the handler refers to the element you bound to
[12:28:39] <Eviltwin> e.target refers to the element that triggered the event
[12:28:43] <te-brian> Eviltwin: I guess that makes sense... the delegation is setting 'this' whereas e.target is the lowest level of the event
[12:28:50] <Eviltwin> "this" will always be a td.vote
[12:28:51] <te-brian> Eviltwin: yep.. makes total sense
[12:28:54] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[12:28:56] <digitalfiz> Eviltwin, I figured it out. validator has a feature to add a success class to the label so i can check :not(.success)
[12:28:59] <digitalfiz> thanks for the help
[12:28:59] <te-brian> Eviltwin: thanks so much for taking a look
[12:29:20] <te-brian> Eviltwin: Delegation is such a savior :)   the original table has > 5000 tds
[12:29:24] <Eviltwin> digitalfiz: You're welcome
[12:29:28] <Eviltwin> te-brian: Nice chart by the way
[12:29:35] <te-brian> shipping labels for either ups or usps?

[12:35:09] <crankharder> is there a better plugin that can help me out?
[12:35:27] <gnarf> crankharder: use a templating plugin
[12:35:51] <gnarf> ?templates
[12:35:52] <te-brian> crankharder: google javascript templating... some starting points .. jqtpl  mustaches hogan
[12:35:53] <bot-t1> gnarf, Templates - These documentation topics concern the jQuery Templates plugin (jquery-tmpl), which can be downloaded from: http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl . http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/

[12:36:23] <vargadanis> hello everyone! do you know of a good plugin for jquery that helps me create rounded corners?

[12:36:37] <gnarf> vargadanis: straight css?
[12:36:42] <gnarf> border-radius ?
[12:36:53] <vargadanis> gnarf, not cross broswer supported
[12:37:02] <vargadanis> IE FTW :)
[12:37:18] <gnarf> vargadanis: let IE suffer
[12:37:20] <gnarf> who cares?
[12:37:30] <gnarf> IE can see boxes
[12:37:35] <Eviltwin> crankharder: Also, rather than $("<input>").attr("name", "foo").attr("type", "text").attr("value", "")
[12:37:50] <Eviltwin> crankharder: You can do $("<input>",{name:"foo",type:"text",value:""});
[12:39:12] <gnarf> jamieyg3: add a class or id to it?
[12:39:47] <jamieyg3> i can't

[12:41:13] <min|dvir|us> Does .prop('checked', true) fire .change()?
[12:41:14] <xckpd7> question: Let's assume I have different modules on the page, and I want the module themselves to hold their own error / success messages. Let's assume I want to use a templating library to separate html from the javascript, let's assume I want to put a script tag inside of the actual module with the temlating. Could I toss the values that would go into the templates, inside the module or script tag inside the module?
[12:44:02] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: I do not believe it does but all you need to do is chain on a .change() to trigger it
[12:44:43] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: I suggest looking at some kind of script encapsulation mechanism
[12:44:48] <Eviltwin> Doesn't have to be very complicated
[12:45:06] <Eviltwin> Could be as simple as using objects for namespace
[12:46:20] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: how do I do this, but so it works:  $(".ui-datepicker-trigger").appendTo($("#dob").next());
[12:46:37] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: That entirely depends on what you're trying to do
[12:46:57] <jeffsmykil> i want to move an element after the element it is currently before
[12:48:37] <jeffsmykil> but the element it is before foes not have a unique identifier
[12:50:17] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: i want to move an element after the element it is currently before but the element it is before foes not have a unique identifier
[12:51:57] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: how about this... basically where I am at right now, is I'm going to need to create a switch statement for different types of forms I have, which will assist in displaying different feedback for how you fill out the form. Is there a good way to be able to pass data from a block of html to a javascript function working on it?

[12:52:48] <nicholasschulz> is there a way to "redirect" a clicked button to another buttons functions? If I click Button2 I want the jQuery to act just like if I clicked Button1…
[12:52:55] <xckpd7> I can do a switch statement but I think it's ugly.... eventually the server will handle letting the javascript know which messages to display... I'm wondering if there is a way to give the Javascript the messages to display from the actual modules themselves
[12:53:00] <gnarf> nicholasschulz: see ?trigger
[12:53:00] <bot-t1> nicholasschulz, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/

[14:11:28] <john> Eviltwin: yep, exactly
[14:11:41] <Eviltwin> john: You can do $(document).delegate(":not(#foo)","click",function(){/*untoggle*/});
[14:11:56] <john> ohhh cool
[14:12:03] <Eviltwin> Lann: A DOM element as an object
[14:12:04] <Eviltwin> ?
[14:12:18] <john> Eviltwin: but will it still try and toggle it when it's closed?

[14:17:48] <zarf> Hi
[14:17:50] <zarf> I have a 5-column table and would like to add an extra column between #1 and #2.
[14:17:56] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Before any datepickers are made
[14:18:03] <zarf> (Its contents should be a function of #1, but for now I'm just trying to add the column.)
[14:18:13] <zarf> The best I can come up with is http://paste.pocoo.org/show/530075/
[14:18:24] <zarf> which only does it in rows #0 (header) and #1.
[14:18:37] <zarf> Can anyone suggest how to get the new cell in every row?
[14:18:37] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: so in document ready should work?
[14:19:10] <Eviltwin> john: A little different: http://jsfiddle.net/p4RZv/
[14:19:32] <Eviltwin> But same idea
[14:19:49] <john> Eviltwin: wow, thanks!  :)
[14:20:01] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: As long as it's before you make the datepickers
[14:20:41] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: and that should make it so it doesn't base the position off the window size?
[14:21:46] <Eviltwin> zarf: If you only have THs in the header row and TDs in the other rows, you can probably just use 'table th' and 'table td' instead of :first and :not(:first) on the trs
[14:22:01] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I don't work with jQuery UI, don't ask me
[14:22:19] <zarf> Eviltwin: thanks, i'm off to try this
[14:23:52] <Eviltwin> zarf: I suspect rather than eq, you want nth-child (see ?:eq) (see ?:nth-child)
[14:23:53] <bot-t1> zarf, .eq() - Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[14:23:54] <bot-t1> zarf, :nth-child() Selector - Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[14:25:11] <zarf> bot-t1: i'm reducing the set of matched columns, not rows
[14:25:13] <bot-t1> zarf, .filter() - Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:25:17] <zarf> bot-t1: (the eq(1) is so a cell will be after column #1)
[14:25:18] <bot-t1> zarf, Stored "(the eq(1)".
[14:26:16] <Eviltwin> zarf: Explain exactly what you're trying to do
[14:26:46] <zarf> bot-t1: add a column between columns #1 and #2 of my table
[14:26:46] <bot-t1> zarf, Plugins/Tablesorter/tablesorter - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Tablesorter/tablesorter#2 of my table
[14:27:46] <Eviltwin> So, two things to think about
[14:28:24] <Eviltwin> 1) I made the observation that the header row only contains th's and that the other rows only contain td's
[14:28:27] <zarf> Eviltwin: you were right about :first and :not(:first)
[14:28:30] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:28:52] <zarf> removing them changes nothing -- but doesn't solve my problem either
[14:28:55] <Eviltwin> 2) You want to insert after nth one within each tr
[14:29:05] <zarf> Eviltwin: yes
[14:29:17] <Eviltwin> eq on a collection will return exactly one element
[14:29:28] <Eviltwin> So unless you want to insert exactly one <td>
[14:29:30] <Eviltwin> It's not the right answer
[14:29:37] <Eviltwin> Which I why I turned you to nth-child
[14:29:41] <zarf> if it were after the last column i could use .append()
[14:29:51] <Eviltwin> Where you are using eq(1), you want to use nth-child(2)
[14:29:54] <zarf> maybe i can do this and permute columns at the end?
[14:30:07] <Eviltwin> Where you are using eq(1), you want to use nth-child(2)
[14:30:33] <zarf> Eviltwin: thanks, will (try to) try this
[14:31:36] <Eviltwin> BBL
[14:32:07] <zarf> Eviltwin: yah, it works!

[14:40:29] <doom777> sarkis: that's hard to believe, since it's simple string concatenation
[14:40:37] <JSM87> Hi guys, im using this plugin. It has a parameter called auto: - When I load the plugin I have auto :1 - my question is, how can I create a button which when clicked sets auto:0 on the fly? Heres the plugin http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/js/jcarousellite_1.0.1.js
[14:41:26] <doom777> hello, how do I add an event to an element replacing all other events of that type?
[14:41:56] <krambiorix> i try to use the fullcalendar plugin and in a script i want to call a function in that plugin like: 		$("#testlink").fullCalendar("slotSelectionMousedown"); --> but the function slotSelectionMousedown isn't called, can someone help ?
[14:42:52] <someprimetime> so i declare a variable which contains a dom object called li. then i have a function, and within that, i declare a (similarly named) variable which has the exact same dom object. for some reason, the global one keeps incrementing, but the other one stays the same. is there a reason for this? http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/K9EYk/3/ check out the lines right below function rightClick()
[14:43:33] <someprimetime> i'd like to just be able to set that object variable once, and not have to re-declare it within the function (to just pass it in for later)
[14:43:39] <someprimetime> i'm trying to make this thing as DRY as possible
[14:47:24] <fatninja> Does anyone know how to use fancybox to include an external link ? I have a list of users and an Edit button and the thing is I want to create a custom form for the user...
[14:49:29] <fatninja> don't bother answering, I think I know how
[14:49:44] <LordThumper> You mean the custom form is in another page?
[14:50:03] <fatninja> LordThumper that form was being generated by a .php , because it takes some info from the database
[14:50:04] <LordThumper> What is a custom form anyways?
[14:50:23] <LordThumper> So you click the link on a.php
[14:50:27] <LordThumper> And the form is on b.php?
[14:50:51] <fatninja> well the thing is I have let's say 10 users in a table in a.php, and when I click edit I want a window-popup to appear
[14:51:21] <fatninja> with all the data completed, so editing can be done easy
[14:51:34] <fatninja> *window-popup = fancybox
[14:51:37] <krambiorix> so in another script i want to call that inner function, can someone take a look at it? How can i call it : http://pastebin.com/UiXyf6u4
[14:51:48] <LordThumper> But where is the form html? On a.php?
[14:51:58] <crankharder> is there a forerunner in the jquery-indexeddb-plugin scene?
[14:52:20] <fatninja> b.php generates the form, because I call it like b.php?userid=n
[14:52:28] <LordThumper> Ajax?
[14:52:42] <fatninja> well… it seems I can do it easier
[14:52:52] <dabear> krambiorix: save to a global variable. like window.foo = function slotSelectionMousedown(ev) { ...
[14:52:54] <fatninja> using fancy box iframe
[14:53:16] <LordThumper> or you could populate on a.php then use fancybox inline
[14:53:26] <dabear> krambiorix: then do window.foo()
[14:53:50] <krambiorix> dabear, save to global variable where? in the plugin or in the script where i want to call it?
[14:54:09] <fatninja> oh, so you're saying just make an edit form in a.php, and then retrieve the data into that form using ajax, is that right ?
[14:54:27] <dabear> save the function to a global variable where you define it
[14:54:27] <LordThumper> Yeah
[14:54:38] <dabear> and then call if with that global function
[14:54:58] <fatninja> LordThumper : also a good idea, but my way seems simpler ( to me at least )
[14:55:35] <LordThumper> fatninja: Fancybox fires an event when it is opened, you could send the ajax request then, and populate the form with that
[14:56:04] <fatninja> I don't handle ajax too well… this is why it's simpler the other way
[14:56:12] <LordThumper> Yeah I understand that
[14:56:31] <fatninja> your way is more elegant, I agree with that
[14:56:37] <LordThumper> Not very experienced with Ajax requests myself.. apart from Asp.net UpdatePanel
[14:57:28] <LordThumper> Yeah I don't see anything wrong with an iframe FancyBox
[14:57:42] <krambiorix> dabear, or can i make a new function in (function($, undefined) { that calls that slotSelectionMousedown ?
[14:58:45] <Entomo> #mo
[14:58:58] <dabear> krambiorix: sure, as long as you have a reference to it. when you define an inner function, only the containing function will have access to it
[14:59:18] <dabear> unless you create a way for other functions to access it
[14:59:28] <dabear> which I explained how to do earlier
[14:59:28] <krambiorix> dabear, okay great, i'll test it
[14:59:30] <someprimetime> how would I add an element directly after a container e.g. <div id="foo"> <stuff I want to add here></div>
[14:59:40] <someprimetime> because append() and after() adds it directly after the </div>
[14:59:42] <dabear> why you would need inner funtions is something that beats me though
[15:00:01] <dabear> you don't need it here, and you generally don't ever need it when doing jquery stuff
[15:00:40] <krambiorix> dabear when i creat a new function with window.foo = function test() -> the other functions don't work anymore
[15:00:41] <dabear> someprimetime: ?append adds it inside, which is what you want
[15:01:27] <dabear> krambiorix: generally, you should now javascript before beginning with any framework, at least a general understanding
[15:01:40] <dabear> ?101
[15:01:40] <bot-t1> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[15:01:52] <someprimetime> dabear: yeah, but it seems to be adding it at the very end before the closing div
[15:01:56] <krambiorix> dabear, i read jquery fundamentals
[15:01:58] <someprimetime> and not right after the declaration of the div
[15:02:22] <dabear> someprimetime: see ?before
[15:02:22] <bot-t1> someprimetime, .before(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/before/
[15:03:13] <dabear> krambiorix: there is *no* need for nested functions here
[15:03:24] <someprimetime> dabear: is there a way to do like before + 1?
[15:03:50] <krambiorix> dabear those nested functions are in the plugin
[15:04:09] <someprimetime> so <div id="foobar"><div id="blah"></div></div> is how it currently is.. i want to add something in between <div id="foobar"> and <div id="blah">
[15:04:11] <dabear> solve it in another way. most likely you can just adda a function handler with and then .trigger a handler manually
[15:04:20] <someprimetime> not before <div id="foobar"> or not after <div id="foobar">
[15:05:52] <dabear> krambiorix: function foo(){ function bar(){};  window.heybaz = bar;  }; then do window.heybaz() from anywhere below that definition
[15:06:28] <tfitts> $.ajax(dataType: 'json', crossDomain: true, jsonp: myCallback, url: 'http://www.example.com/data.js', success: function(data){ console.log(data) }});
[15:06:48] <dabear> krambiorix: also note that you proboly have an ev parameter to the function, so you should probably use window.heybaz(someeventobject), which seems complicated. that's why .trigger seems a better solution
[15:06:56] <JSM87> Hi guys, im using this plugin. It has a parameter called auto: - When I load the plugin I have auto :1 - my question is, how can I create a button which when clicked sets auto:0 on the fly? Heres the plugin http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/js/jcarousellite_1.0.1.js
[15:07:15] <tfitts> what else do you need in an ajax request to fire off a cross-server jsonp request that returns results?
[15:07:25] <dabear> someprimetime: see ?prepend
[15:07:26] <bot-t1> someprimetime, .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[15:08:14] <someprimetime> dabear: woot thanks :D
[15:09:04] <dabear> someprimetime: next time, just go to http://api.jquery.com/ and in the "search jquery" field, type "insert"
[15:09:12] <someprimetime> word thanks
[15:10:09] <krambiorix> dabear: i get window.heybaz is not a function
[15:10:55] <dabear> krambiorix: then you are calling it before the function definition. I also told you basically you are doing it wrong.. use events instead
[15:11:32] <dabear> event binding/triggering, see ?bind and ?trigger
[15:11:32] <bot-t1> .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[15:11:38] <dabear> ?trigger
[15:11:39] <bot-t1> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[15:15:02] <dabear> krambiorix: for basic usage, see http://jsfiddle.net/DHrGw/2/
[15:15:11] <dabear> if you need to do it that way
[15:15:46] <z0ned> i have an array of google.maps.InfoWindow's ... for (var iw in infoWindows) { console.log(iw); }     gives me the index of the iterator, rather than an InfoWindow object .... why?
[15:16:33] <dabear> z0ned: that is unrelated to jquery. infoWindows[iw] will get you the object though
[15:17:05] <z0ned> dabear, i thought the whole point of for..in loops was that the variable was the object, not the index?
[15:17:46] <dabear> z0ned: nope. read again. you'd want a "for each" which is somewhat unsupported
[15:20:36] <krambiorix> dabear , well in that function you showed i try to call other functions in that plugin but they aren't called
[15:20:47] <dabear> z0ned: a normal for loop is most often easier. remember that you also have to add an hasownproperty check to avoid looping over prototype values
[15:21:12] <dabear> krambiorix: I have no idea what you are saying :p
[15:22:31] <krambiorix> dabear: the function you pasted on jsfiddle, i put that in the plugin code and in that function  (bar) i call a function from that plugin
[15:25:01] <dabear> please don't copy/paste. I was providing some code for you to understand what I was typing in english to you here
[15:25:40] <dabear> also note that you shouldn't do this. use events and triggers
[15:26:55] <dabear> Anyways, I'm going to bed, c ya
[15:32:20] <zzzed> hi, i used jhxhr=.ajax(...) to get a jQuery XmlHTTPResponse object, but now, don't know what property or function to use to access the returned XML, any help please?
[15:36:58] <Eviltwin> zzzed: It's actually XmlHttpRequest
[15:37:49] <Eviltwin> zzzed: Read this section: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[15:38:05] <ProLoser|Work> what's the best wysiwyg?
[15:38:07] <Eviltwin> And you should see how to get the retuned XML
[15:38:19] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: I've been poking at jWYSWIYG
[15:38:31] <Eviltwin> Except spelled right
[15:38:57] <fatninja> I need some ajax guidance, and by guidance I mean a link. Jquery APi isn't very clear
[15:39:13] <ProLoser|Work> do you like it?
[15:39:13] <fatninja> It's clear, but learning by examples is the best
[15:39:52] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Meh, I've not yet seen a good WYSIWYG that also works in IE
[15:40:42] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ fatninja
[15:40:42] <bot-t1> fatninja, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:40:43] <zzzed> yes, it says the XmlHttpRequest object has a .responseXML property, but the value is 'undefined'
[15:40:55] <Eviltwin> zzzed: When are you accessing it?
[15:41:27] <zzzed> in the .ready function after doing myXML=.ajax(...)
[15:41:34] <fatninja> Eviltwin I just anticipated the answer : ' Have you read that f*** manual ? '..
[15:41:59] <Eviltwin> fatninja: That depends on the question if the answer is right there in the manual, I'm going to RTFM you
[15:42:12] <Eviltwin> zzzed: It won't be there until it's finished fetching
[15:42:26] <Eviltwin> zzzed: Which isn't until the success/error/complete fires
[15:43:03] <Eviltwin> fatninja: But you haven't actually asked the question yet
[15:43:52] <fatninja> I want to receive some data from a .php file, and I get more than one value, like an array and I have absolutely no idea how this can be done, I don't even know what to search on google
[15:44:15] <Eviltwin> What does the data you get look like?
[15:44:17] <Eviltwin> Or is that up to you?
[15:44:18] <krambiorix> can someone help me with this: how can i pass the event from the script function to the plugin function ? http://jsfiddle.net/c9Stb/2/
[15:45:04] <Eviltwin> krambiorix: I'm going to get you half way there and see if you can get the rest of the way
[15:45:16] <Eviltwin> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/c9Stb/3/
[15:45:54] <fatninja> Eviltwin: something like $firstname, $lastname, bla bla, I get like 8,9 variables
[15:46:38] <Eviltwin> fatninja: $.ajax (and AJAX in general) won't get any data the PHP script doesn't print/echo
[15:47:20] <Eviltwin> krambiorix: Do you know what you need to do to finish it?
[15:47:20] <krambiorix> Eviltwin, thx it worked
[15:47:23] <Eviltwin> K
[15:47:31] <fatninja> Eviltwin: I will echo the data in the PHP, like Firstname LastName bla bla , how do I get it from there
[15:47:44] <Eviltwin> fatninja: So let's say the script is /foo.php
[15:48:10] <Eviltwin> fatninja: $.get("/foo.php", function(data) { /* any echo'd text is accessable in the data var */ });
[15:49:03] <Eviltwin> fatninja: You see how it has a callback, right?
[15:49:22] <Eviltwin> Not like var data = $.get("/foo.php");
[15:49:29] <fatninja> Eviltwin: got it
[15:50:04] <fatninja> so now I have data which contains my output from foo.php
[15:50:11] <Eviltwin> Yes, as text
[15:50:27] <Eviltwin> Now if you're trying to get a structure
[15:50:28] <fatninja> yes, now this text is separated by spaces, and I think I can make it work from here
[15:50:31] <Eviltwin> Or a bunch of variables
[15:50:34] <fatninja> yes..
[15:50:35] <Eviltwin> I suggest you use JSON encoding
[15:50:58] <Eviltwin> server side, you can do <?php echo json_encode($array); ?>
[15:51:11] <Eviltwin> And client side you can do $.parseJSON(data)
[15:51:16] <fatninja> so it is possible
[15:51:17] <Eviltwin> And you'll get essentially the same structure
[15:51:32] <fatninja> but will it work with associative arrays ?
[15:51:39] <Eviltwin> Or $.getJSON("/foo.php", function(data) { ... });
[15:51:47] <Eviltwin> And it'll parse it for you internally
[15:51:49] <krambiorix> Eviltwin, the only thing is that slotSelectionMousedown isn't been called anymore when i added that event
[15:51:56] <Eviltwin> Associative arrays will be stored as objects
[15:52:04] <Eviltwin> Array arrays will be stored as arrays
[15:52:15] <Eviltwin> This is a description of the encoding: http://json.org/
[15:52:27] <Eviltwin> And it also happens to be 100% valid JavaScript syntax
[15:52:32] <Eviltwin> Gotta go, BBL
[15:52:41] <fatninja> I think I can handle it from here, ty for your time :D
[15:53:11] <LordThumper> Yeah JSON is awesome, can convert custom javascript objects to .NET data types with a good serialization library
[15:53:53] <LordThumper> Eviltwin: Do you know if you can pass a data parameter by reference instead of by value in javascript?
[15:54:02] <LordThumper> To a function i mean
[15:56:58] <nicholasschulz> Is there a simple way to check if the user has enabled javascript? Because my page is run entirely on javascript, so I probably should show a message if the user don't have it enabled. I thought of doing something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/tvjxV/
[15:58:24] <udp> nicholasschulz: looks like you're getting the frontend and backend mixed up there

[16:06:25] <TeddyMurray> anyone know any image cropping jquery plugins?
[16:09:02] <DanielBasic> Question about .keydown(). I have this code so far: var avatar = $('#avatar');
[16:09:03] <DanielBasic> $(document).bind('keydown', 'up', function() {
[16:09:03] <DanielBasic> 	avatar.animate({'bottom': '+=20px'}, 'fast');
[16:09:03] <DanielBasic> 	console.log('up');
[16:09:03] <DanielBasic> });
[16:09:04] <DanielBasic> $(document).bind('keydown', 'down', function() {
[16:09:04] <DanielBasic> 	avatar.animate({'bottom': '-=20px'}, 'fast');
[16:09:04] <DanielBasic> 	console.log('down');
[16:09:05] <DanielBasic> });
[16:09:21] <DanielBasic> and when I press any key, all the up and down functions respond, why?
[16:11:16] <someprimetime> what would be the best way to add a div AROUND a bunch of content?
[16:11:27] <BinaryKitten> DanielBasic it doesn't work that way
[16:11:36] <BinaryKitten> ?g jquery keyz
[16:11:37] <bot-t1> BinaryKitten, jQuery Keyz Plugin | BinaryKitten's Development Dropbox - http://binarykitten.me.uk/dev/jq-plugins/259-jquery-keyz-plugin.html
[16:11:54] <someprimetime> wait would wrap() work for this?
[16:11:57] <BinaryKitten> DanielBasic that will give you that functionality
[16:11:59] <DanielBasic> thank you
[16:12:08] <BinaryKitten> someprimetime yes
[16:12:18] <someprimetime> BinaryKitten: cool thanks :D
[16:12:26] <BinaryKitten> $(somecontent).wrap('<div>')
[16:14:41] <imsky> wooo
[16:37:14] <fatninja> in javascript can you have variable within a variable ?
[16:41:24] <fatninja> I have an object data.firstname and var i = "firstname"; , how can I use i to access data.firstname ?
[16:44:33] <Eviltwin> fatninja: data[i]
[16:44:44] <Eviltwin> fatninja: data.firstname === data['firstname']
[16:44:46] <fatninja> it really works ?
[16:44:59] <Eviltwin> It really does
[16:45:41] <fatninja> and if I have an object ( complex array in php ) like : data.rights.module , is it the same as data.rights['module'] ?
[16:46:19] <fatninja> I mentioned complex array in php because it becomes an object after I return it from json
[16:50:57] <fatninja> it works nvm :D
[16:54:11] <LordThumper> .find() is for direct descendants right?
[16:54:54] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: No
[16:54:57] <Eviltwin> That's .children
[16:55:22] <Eviltwin> fatninja: I would try opening the PHP script inthe browser
[16:55:27] <Eviltwin> And taking a look at the JSON
[16:55:29] <Eviltwin> It's pretty human-readable
[16:55:56] <LordThumper> Yeah that's right... I must be using the wrong selector... thanks Eviltwin
[16:55:56] <fatninja> Eviltwin yes yes, I looked at it , it's awesome. I just never knew data.x = data['x'] in js
[16:56:13] <Eviltwin> Yeah, and it's badass
[16:56:22] <Eviltwin> Because it goes even further than that
[16:56:30] <Eviltwin> var x="show"
[16:56:35] <Eviltwin> $("#foo")[x]();
[16:56:41] <Eviltwin> Is the same as $("#foo").show();
[16:56:56] <Eviltwin> How slick is that?
[16:57:02] <fatninja> nice, never knew js is as flexible as php
[16:57:14] <Eviltwin> I consider it to be more flexible
[16:57:24] <Eviltwin> Namely with the way it does OO
[16:57:48] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: If you use a selector like "> .foo" then I think it's child-only
[16:57:53] <nomad111> hi, i am animating setting the 'top' of a div element and noticing that there is artifacting as a result. is there anything i can do to remedy this?

[16:59:19] <nomad111> Eviltwin: I wish I had the time *whisper* i'm at work *whisper*
[16:59:39] <Eviltwin> nomad111: Well unfortunately I have no idea what you mean
[16:59:44] <Eviltwin> So unless you can show me, I can't really help you
[17:00:17] <nomad111> that's ok, i thought it might have been a common issue people encounter
[17:04:42] <fatninja> I have something like $("#blabla #bla").click(function(){}); is there a way in this selection to access #blabla #blu, something like his parent..
[17:05:08] <Eviltwin> ?
[17:05:59] <fatninja> ok, let me tell it practical : I have a table and on each row, two checkboxes, one for read one for write, I want to make it so when you click write, automatically it checks read, and if you uncheck read it will uncheck write.
[17:06:24] <fatninja> I made something that works but I think it's too stupid.

[17:11:37] <Eviltwin> velts: Don't cookies get sent with XKR?
[17:11:44] <LordThumper> "this" inside the function to get the element that triggered the event

[17:19:53] <fatninja> is it possible to use jq validation class to check if at least one checkbox is checked within the form ?
[17:20:32] <aLiEn___> $('input[type=checkbox]:checked').length > 0
[17:20:33] <Eviltwin> It's easy to test using jQuery. Not sure if it's built in
[17:21:51] <fatninja> I see..
[17:22:10] <aLiEn___> fatninja it help you?
[17:22:37] <fatninja> aLiEn___:  yes, I was using something similar but type=checkbox looks nicer :D
[17:23:00] <Eviltwin> You can also do $(":checkbox:checked").length but it's not any faster
[17:23:24] <fatninja> even nicer :))
[17:23:28] <aLiEn___> =)
[17:23:29] <Eviltwin> Well $("input:checkbox:checked").lenth
[17:23:34] <Eviltwin> Will be the same speed
[17:23:36] <Eviltwin> .length
[17:24:49] <aLiEn___> Eviltwin nice
[17:25:00] <udp> we concluded that [type=checkbox] is faster than :checkbox yesterday
[17:25:13] <Eviltwin> Well it can be
[17:25:54] <fatninja> :))
[17:27:02] <snover> Eviltwin: :checked is a valid CSS3 selector, so it will be faster for engines that support it
[17:27:09] <snover> :checkbox is never a valid CSS selector
[17:28:11] <someprimetime> why exactly am i not able to use my global variable "li" within my function rightClick() without it giving me a bunch of erroneous incremental values?
[17:28:14] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/K9EYk/6/
[17:28:32] <someprimetime> if you view the console log after pressing right a bunch of times, you'll see what i'm talking about
[17:28:52] <someprimetime> it seems to be incrementing the width instead of keeping it at the image width/height + margin (which should be 85 in this particular case)
[17:29:05] <someprimetime> the reason I ask is because I'm trying to make this as DRY as possible
[17:29:22] <Eviltwin> snover: Works just fine here
[17:30:03] <udp> Eviltwin: did you mean someprimetime?
[17:30:03] <snover> Eviltwin: what works just fine there?
[17:30:20] <Eviltwin> Sorry, that was for someprimetime
[17:30:30] <snover> GEEZ
[17:30:51] <SkyFlyer> The events I'm now sorting.  However there are about 400 of them.  is this a good way to do it? it's working, but slow.. http://jsfiddle.net/khh2f/1/
[17:31:05] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah, it should still work, but let me turn it on to show you what i'm talking about.. the reason i left it like this was so you could see the difference in values being generated between the variable "li" and the other variable "list
[17:31:08] <someprimetime> +"
[17:31:13] <Eviltwin> SkyFlyer: That's slow?
[17:31:49] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/K9EYk/7/
[17:32:04] <Eviltwin> SkyFlyer: If you're sorting 400 items and a comparison callback is slow, you're doing more than sorting 400 items
[17:32:24] <diverdude> If i open 2 windows with firefox and log into my homepage which uses session to identify the user, i am logged in both FF windows. Is there a way to have a different session in each FF window?
[17:32:34] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: What's different?
[17:32:44] <someprimetime> click right more than 2 times
[17:32:46] <aLiEn___> i found a one bug in webkit
[17:32:48] <someprimetime> it goes haywire
[17:32:49] <SkyFlyer> ok, so you guys don't see anything wrong with that?
[17:32:51] <aLiEn___> http://www.aliengames.com.br/bug.html
[17:33:07] <aLiEn___> click in botton.. after press F12
[17:33:45] <udp> aLiEn___: F12?
[17:33:50] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: You mean when you don't make the list inside rightClick and leftClick?
[17:34:00] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah
[17:34:09] <someprimetime> when i use the var li declared @ the top
[17:34:13] <aLiEn___> udp yes
[17:34:17] <LordThumper> Click what?
[17:34:18] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: That's because the list order changes
[17:34:19] <aLiEn___> udp see link
[17:34:26] <Eviltwin> When you shuffle
[17:34:27] <LordThumper> No errors come in console
[17:34:28] <udp> aLiEn___: odd, it appears right away in FF but not in chrome
[17:34:54] <aLiEn___> udp chrome or safari
[17:34:57] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: So you either need to shuffle the list or  regenerate it
[17:35:10] <LordThumper> aLiEn: Using Chrome, no errors here
[17:35:12] <udp> aLiEn___: you should wait until the DOM is ready before appending it to the ul anyway
[17:36:29] <doritoDan> Hi
[17:36:30] <doritoDan> $('a').click(function(event){ return false; });
[17:36:39] <doritoDan> Shouldn't this stop the redirection followed by a link press?
[17:37:01] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: Of any links in the document when that code is run
[17:37:06] <doritoDan> yes
[17:37:07] <LordThumper> aLiEn: Tried the same site in FF, same behaviour
[17:37:12] <Eviltwin> Are you doing it on document ready?
[17:37:13] <doritoDan> I can't get it to work on my site.
[17:37:17] <doritoDan> No, I'm not.
[17:37:18] <aLiEn___> udp how?
[17:37:32] <doritoDan> The coding example didn't provide me with any additional code
[17:37:38] <doritoDan> How idiotic.
[17:37:40] <doritoDan> Thanks.
[17:37:40] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: Before document ready, there are NO links in the document
[17:37:44] <doritoDan> ok
[17:37:46] <Eviltwin> There's nothing in the document
[17:37:47] <udp> aLiEn___: with jquery's .ready()?  or whatever else you want to use
[17:37:48] <doritoDan> I understand.
[17:37:54] <Eviltwin> K
[17:37:56] <doritoDan> Thanks.
[17:38:05] <Eviltwin> What version of jQuery are you using?
[17:38:55] <doritoDan> The latest one.
[17:39:36] <Eviltwin> Do $(document).on("click", "a", function() { return false; }) to block all links current and future but only bind one event listener
[17:39:51] <Eviltwin> Using event bubbling / delegation
[17:40:22] <Eviltwin> Or as a shortcut (for either syntax) $(document).on("click", "a", false);
[17:40:37] <Eviltwin> You use the false instead of function() { return false; }
[17:40:43] <fatninja> Can you uncheck all checkboxes at once ? $("#editUserForm input[type=checkbox]:checked").prop('checked','false'); <- does not work..
[17:41:00] <Eviltwin> fatninja: That's because it's false, not 'false'
[17:41:16] <doritoDan> Thanks Eviltwin, it worked.
[17:41:30] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: That can also be done before doc ready if you want
[17:41:37] <Eviltwin> Not that there's any good readon to
[17:41:38] <fatninja> *facepalm*
[17:41:39] <doritoDan> aight
[17:41:39] <Eviltwin> reason*
[17:42:45] <aLiEn___> udp see again http://www.aliengames.com.br/bug.html
[17:43:43] <udp> yeah that's pretty odd (doesn't happen in FF though)
[17:44:36] <udp> maybe a webkit thing
[17:46:08] <LordThumper> What is the bug?
[17:46:25] <LordThumper> I am getting "bug" text attached to the li element
[17:46:26] <udp> the "BUG" text doesn't appear immediately when you click the button
[17:46:38] <udp> at least for me (and presumably aLiEN___) when using chrome
[17:46:39] <LordThumper> Immediately here
[17:46:42] <LordThumper> Using latest Chrome
[17:46:55] <LordThumper> v16
[17:47:13] <udp> 16.0.912.63
[17:47:26] <LordThumper> Yeah same... strange
[17:47:29] <aLiEn___> 16.0.912.63 m
[17:47:37] <aLiEn___> very strange
[17:47:48] <LordThumper> yeah... How long is the delay?
[17:47:49] <udp> LordThumper: which operating system?
[17:47:56] <LordThumper> Win7 x64
[17:47:57] <doritoDan> Eviltwin: I have another strange problem. I'm selecting an element named #foo.open after which i event.preventDefault() and then toggleClass('open') followed by toggleClass('closed')
[17:47:58] <udp> I can't get it to show at all now
[17:48:01] <aLiEn___> LordThumper no delay
[17:48:03] <udp> it used to show after opening the debugger
[17:48:08] <aLiEn___> yes
[17:48:17] <doritoDan> however, when i click on the link when it's #foo.closed, it runs the same damn script
[17:48:23] <doritoDan> even though the script explicitly selects #foo.open
[17:48:26] <LordThumper> no delay.. then what is the problem?
[17:48:40] <doritoDan> Do you know why?
[17:49:11] <LordThumper> I am getting the "bug" text attached immediately after clicking the button
[17:49:16] <LordThumper> Whether or not Console is open
[17:49:26] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: Can you reproduce it in a jsFiddle?
[17:49:30] <doritoDan> ok
[17:50:47] <aLiEn___> LordThumper test in safari
[17:52:18] <doritoDan> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/ePRbJ/
[17:52:40] <doritoDan> As you can see, on each click it switches the class of #foo
[17:52:48] <doritoDan> even though the script only selects #foo.open
[17:52:53] <doritoDan> How is this possible?
[17:53:18] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: ahh ok
[17:55:43] <LordThumper> doritoDan, that is because that event is bound when document is ready
[17:55:52] <doritoDan> LordThumper: What do you mean?
[17:55:54] <LordThumper> When the class is still 'open'
[17:56:09] <LordThumper> That means if you change the class, it will still trigger the event
[17:56:17] <doritoDan> Why
[17:56:21] <doritoDan> That's really bad.
[17:56:29] <doritoDan> How can I prevent it?
[17:56:50] <LordThumper> Ok I will try to fix your problem, but Eviltwin has probably fixed it for you already
[17:56:55] <doritoDan> ok
[17:56:57] <doritoDan> thanks a lot
[17:58:11] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: http://jsfiddle.net/ePRbJ/1/
[17:58:49] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: Can also be done as http://jsfiddle.net/ePRbJ/2/
[17:59:41] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: Are you trying to make it not trigger when you click the second time?
[18:01:23] <Eviltwin> $(".open") selects all elements that match have the class "open" right now
[18:01:30] <Eviltwin> And builds a collection out of them
[18:01:48] <Eviltwin> Then to each item in that collection, it will bind an event listener for the "click" event
[18:01:59] <Eviltwin> Regardless of how the classes change
[18:02:19] <Eviltwin> The collection will still be those same elements
[18:02:20] <doritoDan> Eviltwin yes
[18:02:23] <Eviltwin> Unless you make a new collection
[18:03:13] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: If you want it to only apply when it currently has that class, you need to check in the listener
[18:03:19] <Eviltwin> And behave conditionally there
[18:04:23] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ePRbJ/3/
[18:04:26] <someprimetime> how would i rewrite: $('#carousel_ul:not(:animated)') if i put $('#carousel_ul'); into a variable?
[18:04:52] <Eviltwin> carousel.not(":animated")
[18:05:32] <someprimetime> ah didn't know I could use . instead of :
[18:05:35] <someprimetime> thanks Eviltwin :)
[18:06:15] <Eviltwin> The :not() in the selector actually ends up calling the .not() method
[18:08:14] <doritoDan> Eviltwin: Alright.
[18:08:15] <doritoDan> Thanks pal.
[18:08:21] <krambiorix> does anyone know where i can find some jquery contractors?
[18:08:52] <Eviltwin> I do 15-minute jQuery gigs
[18:08:55] <Eviltwin> $100 a piece
[18:09:19] <krambiorix> Eviltwin, you have cheaper "friends" ?
[18:09:30] <Eviltwin> Not that know jQuery
[18:10:24] <krambiorix> any website to find good contractors for jquery?
[18:10:39] <jstonne> Hello Eviltwin
[18:10:57] <Eviltwin> krambiorix: I have no idea but let me know if you find one
[18:11:01] <Eviltwin> You're not the first to ask
[18:11:13] <krambiorix> :-)
[18:12:11] <jstonne> I'm looking for isDeferred(); eviltwin. What would you suggest
[18:12:13] <someprimetime> krambiorix: i'd go with Eviltwin if i were you
[18:12:26] <krambiorix> lol
[18:12:35] <krambiorix> someprimetime, that could get pretty expensive
[18:12:37] <someprimetime> dude knows his shit
[18:12:39] <Eviltwin> jstonne: This? http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[18:12:50] <someprimetime> depends what you'd need done though ;)
[18:13:12] <jstonne> Doesn't come with $.isDeferred(); etc…  i need to test if an object is a deferred object.
[18:13:35] <Eviltwin> Why do you need to test if an object is a Deferred?
[18:15:53] <jstonne> yeah good question, maybe i need to rethink what I'm doing.
[18:16:47] <Eviltwin> Looks like internally jQuery uses something along the lines of object && $.isFunction(object.promise)
[18:17:26] <jstonne> oh I have a function that expects a deferred object…. but typeof=="object" doesn't cut it. :-)
[18:17:41] <jstonne> ah okay that'll work Eviltwin.
[18:17:59] <jstonne> Thanks dude.
[18:18:14] <Eviltwin> Not a guarantee
[18:18:49] <jstonne> yeah if an object comes with a promise property… then it'll pass the test.. but i think it'll work for no.
[18:18:50] <jstonne> now*
[18:19:14] <Eviltwin> jstonne: When jQuery uses that test, it immediately makes a .promise() out of it
[18:19:25] <jstonne> i see
[18:30:19] <doritoDan> Eviltwin: How can I check if the user's mouse is not hovering over a div?
[18:30:26] <doritoDan> er, cursor*
[18:44:19] <Eviltwin> Sorry, AFK'd for a bit there
[18:45:18] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: You should first see ?.hover to detect when the mouse enters and exits
[18:45:18] <bot-t> doritoDan, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[18:45:28] <doritoDan> yes but
[18:45:41] <doritoDan> how can i check whether the user is NOT hovering over a specific element
[18:45:49] <Eviltwin> Why?
[18:45:55] <doritoDan> popup menu
[18:46:13] <Eviltwin> Links inside a popup menu
[18:46:15] <Eviltwin> ?
[18:46:17] <doritoDan> ye
[18:46:18] <doritoDan> s
[18:46:35] <Eviltwin> Bind to those links in particular and stopPropagation
[18:47:32] <Eviltwin> That'll prevent it from getting to the overarching delegate preventDefault for all A's
[18:48:06] <Eviltwin> I presume that's what you're trying to do
[18:49:45] <Eviltwin> Make sense?
[18:56:17] <doritoDan> Eviltwin I'm not sure I understand
[18:56:17] <doritoDan> but
[18:56:20] <doritoDan> I'll look into it
[18:56:21] <doritoDan> thanks pal
[18:56:29] <Eviltwin> Do you know what event bubbling is?
[18:58:44] <doritoDan> Uh
[18:58:44] <doritoDan> No
[18:58:46] <doritoDan> I don't think so
[18:58:50] <doritoDan> Why?
[18:58:52] <Eviltwin> Let's say I have <div><span><b><a>Foo</a></b></span></div>
[18:59:00] <Eviltwin> And I have a click listener on the span
[18:59:06] <Eviltwin> And a click listener on the A
[18:59:15] <Eviltwin> And the user clicks the "Foo" text
[18:59:20] <Eviltwin> What event listener gets triggered?
[18:59:32] <doritoDan> yes I understand the logic behind doing this
[18:59:36] <doritoDan> I just don't understand how to do it technically
[18:59:37] <doritoDan> :)
[18:59:47] <Eviltwin> So answer the question
[18:59:58] <Eviltwin> Click listener on the SPAN and another one on the A
[19:00:02] <Eviltwin> And I click the text "Foo"
[19:00:05] <Eviltwin> Which one gets triggered?
[19:00:42] <doritoDan> I don't understand any of the terminology you're using but logically you'll want to run a check on a wrapper to complement the anchor's click area and ensure that the popup doesn't close when you leave it
[19:00:49] <Eviltwin> Oh
[19:00:55] <Eviltwin> Lets say my body is <div><span><b><a>Foo</a></b></span></div>
[19:01:13] <Eviltwin> And I have $("span").click(function(){alert("X!")})
[19:01:24] <Eviltwin> And $("a").click(function(){alert("Y!")})
[19:01:36] <Eviltwin> And the user clicks on the "Foo" text
[19:01:43] <Eviltwin> Do they see any alerts?
[19:02:07] <doritoDan> I don't know, I haven't tried. I'm guessing the user only gets X considering that clicks are normally ignored like that in HTML
[19:02:26] <doritoDan> when you superimpose two anchors over each other
[19:02:30] <doritoDan> the bottom one is ignored
[19:03:55] <RLa> i guess you gotta try
[19:04:12] <Eviltwin> doritoDan: http://jsfiddle.net/qNn94/
[19:04:58] <RLa> so it gets propagated upwards
[19:05:06] <Eviltwin> It "bubbles"
[19:05:10] <RLa> if you do not cancel it
[19:05:30] <Eviltwin> The "bottommost" element gets its handlers triggered first
[19:05:38] <Eviltwin> And then each element all the way up to the top
[19:05:44] <Eviltwin> The document
[19:06:30] <doritoDan> Eviltwin: Ah, alright.
[19:06:32] <doritoDan> I understand.
[19:06:39] <doritoDan> THe name "bubbling" makes sense then. :P
[19:06:53] <Eviltwin> If in the one with the alert("Y!"), I were to stopPropagation(), the alert("X!") wouldn't get triggered
[19:07:09] <Eviltwin> Unless I clicked outside the A but still inside the SPAN (not actaully possible in this case)
[19:07:18] <doritoDan> What does stopPropagation do?
[19:07:48] <Eviltwin> Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/qNn94/1/
[19:07:53] <Eviltwin> Clicking Foo and Bar
[19:08:19] <Eviltwin> See what happens
[19:08:54] <Eviltwin> Then try this: http://jsfiddle.net/qNn94/2/
[19:09:19] <Eviltwin> And see the difference in behavior
[19:10:04] <doritoDan> Ah
[19:10:04] <doritoDan> yeah
[19:10:06] <doritoDan> I see
[19:11:11] <Eviltwin> .delegate uses event bubbling to accomplish its goal
[19:12:29] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/qNn94/3/
[19:13:00] <doritoDan> Hm
[19:13:01] <doritoDan> Alright
[19:13:03] <doritoDan> I'll check this out then.
[19:13:12] <doritoDan> I'll have to do some fiddling around. :P
[19:13:12] <Eviltwin> Notice that if you click "Foo"
[19:13:20] <Eviltwin> The SPAN click actually triggers before the A delegate
[19:14:12] <Eviltwin> This is because delegate does there is catch events that bubble all the way up to the top (are done bubbling and the bubbling wasn't stopped)
[19:14:53] <Eviltwin> So now let's make things more interesting
[19:14:54] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/qNn94/3/
[19:15:08] <Eviltwin> Err
[19:15:12] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/qNn94/4/
[19:16:19] <Eviltwin> Notice what happens when you click Foo and click Bar
[19:17:28] <doritoDan> Yeah
[19:17:30] <doritoDan> Eviltwin
[19:17:35] <doritoDan> I understand htis but
[19:17:36] <Eviltwin> So now check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/qNn94/5/
[19:17:38] <doritoDan> I'm still sort of new
[19:17:44] <doritoDan> give me some time to digest your examples
[19:17:47] <doritoDan> I gotta play around with this
[19:17:49] <LordThumper> Can I return a variable of type integer and null in the same function?
[19:17:50] <Eviltwin> Then go back through
[19:17:55] <Eviltwin> You have logs, right?
[19:17:59] <LordThumper> As I understand int is a primitive data type
[19:18:00] <doritoDan> Ah, cool
[19:18:01] <doritoDan> Yeah
[19:18:03] <doritoDan> I have logs.
[19:18:07] <doritoDan> Go ahead. :)
[19:19:05] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: You can return anything you want from a JavaScript function
[19:19:09] <Eviltwin> It's entirely loosely typed
[19:20:33] <LordThumper> Ah awesome thanks
[19:23:39] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: http://jsfiddle.net/DrPdY/
[19:23:49] <CrazyThinker> Anyone use mustache with jquer?
[19:24:35] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: That function returns a whole bunch of different types
[19:25:14] <LordThumper> Thanks :)
[19:26:33] <LordThumper> Yeah only limitation I noticed so far is the lack of support for passing a parameter to a function by reference instead of by value
[19:26:37] <cloudsben> hi there
[19:26:38] <doritoDan> Eviltwin: Thanks for the help.
[19:26:42] <doritoDan> I'm fiddling around with this. :)
[19:26:44] <doritoDan> Much appreciated pal.
[19:26:52] <doritoDan> =D
[19:26:52] <LordThumper> But that's a minor issue
[19:27:40] <Eviltwin> LordThumper: Instead of function x(a) { a = 3; } var b = 2; x(b); alert(b);
[19:28:00] <Eviltwin> YOu can do function x(a) { a[0] = 3; } var b = [2]; x(b); alert(b[0]);
[19:28:39] <Eviltwin> Or function x(a) { a.r = 3; } var b = {r:2}; x(b); alert(b.r);
[19:29:19] <LordThumper> Ah I see, nice solution
[19:29:43] <Eviltwin> Arrays and Objects are always passed by reference
[19:29:51] <LordThumper> Setting the reference inside the function instead of in the parameter list
[19:31:13] <Eviltwin> Another useful thing is closures
[19:31:31] <Eviltwin> Even if you don't know what they are, if you've used jQuery, you've used them
[19:51:24] <lrvick> Anyone know a way to inject @media queries directly within jquery
[19:51:30] <lrvick> in a way the browser will see right away?
[19:51:37] <Eviltwin> ?
[19:52:06] <Eviltwin> I believe you need to add a new <style> tag with CSS in it
[19:52:15] <lrvick> things like "@media screen and (max-width: 800px){}
[19:52:34] <lrvick> i dont think $.css() can deal with that
[19:52:43] <lrvick> just create a style tag and append to head?
[19:52:47] <lrvick> haw, i guess that works
[20:14:00] <ari5av> <div id="x"><div class="y">foo</div></div> <--- if I have this HTML, I want to duplicate Y on a certain event.  basically adding another row to what isn't actually a table.  would this work?  $('#x .y').filter(':first').clone().appendTo('#x');
[20:14:48] <innociv_> What is the proper way to move something, and all the dom with it?  If I do $(selector containing elements that have some javascript attached to them like tinymce or ckeditor).appendTo(somewhere else) it shows the html for tinymce and ckeditor but they don't actually function
[20:17:25] <Eviltwin> ?tias @ ari5av
[20:17:26] <bot-t> ari5av, Try It And See
[20:17:41] <someprimetime> innociv_: try http://api.jquery.com/on/ ?
[20:17:46] <someprimetime> or delegate()
[20:17:51] <Eviltwin> ari5av: But I would do $("#x .y").first().clone().appendTo("#x") instead
[20:18:11] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: do you recommend first() because :first relies on css support?
[20:18:14] <innociv_> Erm, in what way?
[20:18:16] <someprimetime> because i've heard it's slower
[20:18:39] <innociv_> What does moving html and the dom have to do with events?
[20:18:53] <someprimetime> well when you say the objects aren't functional, you might need to bind the events to the on() method
[20:19:05] <someprimetime> this is needed when you are adding new elements to the dom iirc
[20:19:08] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Then you've heard wrong, :first causes a call to .first()
[20:19:14] <innociv_> I want to copy what they already have...
[20:19:17] <innociv_> And there is a ton of stuff :\
[20:19:31] <Eviltwin> innociv_: You want to copy or move?
[20:19:35] <innociv_> I probably want clone..
[20:19:35] <innociv_> Move.
[20:19:44] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: what about this: http://jsperf.com/jquery-css3-not-vs-not ?
[20:19:55] <someprimetime> granted, that's for not()
[20:20:01] <Eviltwin> innociv_: Try .detach() then .appendTo()
[20:20:15] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: And that's precisely the problem
[20:20:26] <innociv_> I need to move .me to the top in <ul><li class="not-me" /><li class="not-me" /><li class="not-me" /><li class="me" /></ul>
[20:20:26] <Eviltwin> Some of the pseudo selectors are CSS3-supported
[20:20:42] <Eviltwin> Some are Sizzle or jQuery additions which are not suppored by any browsers
[20:21:28] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Which is why you have to be particularly careful
[20:22:02] <someprimetime> ah, so you are saying that css3 support for pseudo selectors gets in the way of query and obfuscates what method one should use?
[20:22:18] <innociv_> Eviltwin, looks like that worked.
[20:22:30] <someprimetime> i always try to use query instead of of css3 pseudo selectors though
[20:22:32] <someprimetime> jquery*
[20:23:36] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsperf.com/first-vs-first-2
[20:24:03] <Eviltwin> Pseudo selectors were added as a convenient syntax for filtering elements
[20:24:16] <someprimetime> oh damn
[20:24:16] <ari5av> Eviltwin: thanks for the advice.
[20:24:19] <someprimetime> 30%slower
[20:24:31] <Eviltwin> Many of them are part of CSS3
[20:24:46] <Eviltwin> Sizzle and jQuery decided to support other filters too
[20:24:57] <Eviltwin> As a result, tnose filters need to be processed in JavaScript
[20:25:00] <Eviltwin> those*
[20:25:57] <someprimetime> ah ok, so it's just an additional layer which is unnecessary
[20:26:30] <Eviltwin> Unnecessary?
[20:27:07] <someprimetime> the css3 pseudo-selectors
[20:27:13] <someprimetime> right?
[20:27:26] <LordThumper> Necessary when you don't have an alternative ;p
[20:27:31] <Eviltwin> You could argue that the attribute selector is "unneccessary"
[20:27:34] <Eviltwin> As long as you have an alternative
[20:27:49] <jstonne> milliseconds of differences don't bother me.
[20:28:12] <Eviltwin> Or that being able to specify descendants or siblings in a selector is unnecessary
[20:28:19] <Eviltwin> Because you can always put an ID or class on something
[20:28:21] <LordThumper> Might cripple your calculator though
[20:28:45] <LordThumper> :P
[20:28:47] <Eviltwin> Nothing is strictly "necessary"
[20:29:00] <Eviltwin> But pseudo selectors are designed to be a sort of filter and even an extension
[20:29:03] <jstonne> lol
[20:29:07] <Eviltwin> Like in the case of the :hover CSS3 selector
[20:29:21] <Eviltwin> Anyway
[20:29:24] <Eviltwin> Long story short
[20:29:47] <Eviltwin> Some selectors can be optimized by using querySelectorAll()
[20:29:51] <Eviltwin> A feature of many modern browsers
[20:30:04] <Eviltwin> In which the selector is proccessed in C/C++
[20:30:08] <Eviltwin> Which is a fuckton faster than JavaScript
[20:30:19] <Eviltwin> But others can't
[20:30:20] <someprimetime> hell yeah
[20:30:53] <Eviltwin> So these: http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#selectors
[20:31:00] <Eviltwin> Are the (somewhat) agreed upon CSS3 selectors
[20:31:34] <Eviltwin> And not all of those are supported by jQuery because they don't make sense
[20:31:41] <Eviltwin> Like :hover or :focus or ::first-line
[20:31:49] <someprimetime> yeah wtf is E:lang(fr)
[20:31:52] <someprimetime> lame.
[20:31:57] <Eviltwin> Based on the document language
[20:32:04] <Eviltwin> Anyway
[20:32:06] <Eviltwin> Moving on
[20:32:19] <Eviltwin> querySelectorAll (ideally) recognizes these
[20:32:30] <Eviltwin> Now you pointed me to http://jsperf.com/jquery-css3-not-vs-not
[20:32:39] <Eviltwin> Where the selector is faster than the method
[20:32:47] <Eviltwin> That only applies for browsers that support QSA
[20:33:11] <someprimetime> h/o a sec.. move back for a quick sec. you said the selector is processed in C/C++..  how is that possible when it's being rendered in the browser?
[20:33:39] <Eviltwin> You can do element.querySelectorAll("selector goes here")
[20:33:53] <Eviltwin> And as long as it's a valid CSS3 selector (and the browser supports it)
[20:34:03] <LordThumper> someprimetime: Well I only know that Chrome can run compiled C++ through Native Client
[20:34:12] <Eviltwin> The selector processing and matching is done by the browser itself in C/C++
[20:34:46] <someprimetime> ahh ok
[20:34:49] <Eviltwin> If it's not a valid CSS3 selector or the browser doesn't support it, obivously it can't work that way
[20:35:05] <Eviltwin> So Sizzle (the selector engine that powers jQuery) does that work in JavaScript instead
[20:35:17] <Eviltwin> Which can be significantly slower
[20:35:31] <someprimetime> ah that's what Sizzle is
[20:35:33] <Eviltwin> Now you pointed me at this: http://jsperf.com/jquery-css3-not-vs-not
[20:35:41] <Eviltwin> Where the selector is faster
[20:36:00] <Eviltwin> That's because the whole selector is supported by querySelectorAll
[20:36:07] <Eviltwin> Now check this out: http://jsperf.com/jquery-css3-not-vs-not/11
[20:36:07] <someprimetime> so the native method using querySelectorAll is the ideal way to do it, since it could potentially be rendered in C/C++
[20:36:20] <someprimetime> but jQuery uses this thing called Sizzle which does it in js, thus making it slower by comparison
[20:36:26] <Eviltwin> CSS3's :not(...) only supports a "simple" selector
[20:36:42] <Eviltwin> And :not(#header) is not a "simple" selector
[20:36:48] <Eviltwin> So that processing needs to happen in Sizzle
[20:37:07] <Eviltwin> So the selector becomes slower again
[20:37:27] <Eviltwin> :first isn't a CSS3 psuedo selector
[20:37:29] <tash> is $('#id").click(function() { alert('test'); }); an ok way to do an on click?
[20:37:31] <Eviltwin> So it also happens in Sizzle
[20:37:34] <Eviltwin> Crazy, huh?
[20:37:40] <someprimetime> yeah.. makes sense though now
[20:37:47] <tash> I'm just going off of a .change I was using, so curious is all
[20:37:57] <Eviltwin> tash: A hell of a lot better way to do an onclick than an onclick
[20:38:19] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://sizzlejs.com/
[20:38:20] <tash> Evintwin: is that sarcasm?
[20:38:24] <Eviltwin> Look at "Selector Features"
[20:38:41] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: he meant onclick() inline
[20:38:48] <someprimetime> err Taggnostr
[20:38:50] <someprimetime> fuck sorry
[20:38:54] <someprimetime> that was meant to go to TASH
[20:38:56] <Eviltwin> tash: No, binding with .click is a much better way of doing it than <a onclick="alert('test')"></a>
[20:38:58] <someprimetime> haha jesus colloquy
[20:39:03] <someprimetime> you piece of shit irc client (sometimes)
[20:39:43] <someprimetime> alright well you convinced me to change a lot of my pseudo selectors in http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/K9EYk/8/
[20:40:12] <Eviltwin> Why?
[20:40:14] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: so did the jQuery core team write sizzle?
[20:40:24] <Eviltwin> All of these operations take less than a millisecond
[20:40:28] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: idk, it just seemed cleaner
[20:40:39] <someprimetime> more "pure" imo
[20:40:49] <Eviltwin> Unless you're doing them over 5,000 times in a row
[20:40:59] <Eviltwin> Not even going to be noticed by the user
[20:41:11] <tash> Evintwin: thanks
[20:41:12] <someprimetime> oh well i've got slight OCD
[20:41:29] <Eviltwin> Sizzle was done before jQuery I believe
[20:41:45] <Eviltwin> But I don't actually know
[20:41:51] <someprimetime> i mean, in theory it sounds cool though
[20:41:54] <someprimetime> pseudo selectors
[20:42:06] <someprimetime> it abstracts things more for the end user
[20:43:22] <Eviltwin> It means that when done right in a modern browser, a complicated bit of processing can be handed off to C/C++ instead of being done in JavaScript
[20:45:27] <Eviltwin> Anyway
[20:45:48] <Eviltwin> What's more interesting is how the matching works
[20:45:57] <jstonne> very clever Eviltwin.
[20:46:29] <Eviltwin> For example if you have "table tr td" as a selector
[20:46:41] <Eviltwin> Do you know how it matches that?
[20:48:13] <Eviltwin> Older selector engines found every <table> in the document
[20:48:23] <Eviltwin> Then within each of those found every <tr>
[20:48:35] <Eviltwin> And then within each of those found every <td>
[20:49:00] <Eviltwin> "Left-to-right" or "Top-to-bottom" matching
[20:49:09] <Eviltwin> Modern selector engines start by finding every <td>
[20:49:21] <Eviltwin> Then filters those down by checking if they're inside a <tr> that's inside a <table>
[20:49:31] <Eviltwin> "Right-to-left" or "Bottom-to-top" matching
[20:49:53] <Eviltwin> And it's faster in most cases
[20:50:51] <Eviltwin> With an LTR parser for "table > tr > td"
[20:50:59] <Eviltwin> You might optimize by finding every table
[20:51:13] <Eviltwin> And only check for <tr>'s as immediate children
[20:51:22] <Eviltwin> Then only for <td>'s as immediate children of those
[20:51:41] <Eviltwin> Avoid searching the whole DOM after finding the <table>s
[20:51:58] <Eviltwin> With RTL, it'll find all <td>s and filter just like it did before
[20:52:14] <Eviltwin> Which means with RTL "table td" is faster than "table > tr > td"
[20:52:20] <Eviltwin> Always
[20:53:01] <Eviltwin> And I'm talking to myself again
[20:54:06] <RLa> i have heard that v8 implements lot of "builtins" in javascript itself
[20:54:17] <RLa> not sure about dom functionality tho
[20:54:49] <Eviltwin> Things like sorting an array with .sort
[20:56:17] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: no you aren't
[20:56:34] <someprimetime> was talking to my boss for a sec sorry
[20:57:29] <someprimetime> the top up approach seems smarter to do
[20:57:37] <someprimetime> in the table tr td example
[20:57:42] <Eviltwin> Which is why it's "modern" :P
[20:57:51] <Eviltwin> The reason you should be aware of it
[20:58:24] <Eviltwin> Is lets say you do "form.active :checkbox"
[20:58:39] <Eviltwin> And there's only one <form> with class "active" at a time
[20:58:51] <Eviltwin> And it only had a few elements in it
[20:59:18] <Eviltwin> With LTR, it would find the <form>s and filter down to those with class "active"
[20:59:20] <tp43> what is good drop down menu that doesn't have too much styling
[20:59:29] <Eviltwin> Then search every element in there for checkboxes
[20:59:36] <Eviltwin> Which wouldn't be so bad
[20:59:50] <Eviltwin> But with RTL, it goes through every element
[21:00:05] <Eviltwin> In the entire document
[21:00:12] <Eviltwin> And filters down to the ones that are checkboxes
[21:00:33] <Eviltwin> Then sees if they're in a <form> with class "active"
[21:00:52] <danzik17> :checkbox is a bad pseudo to begin with =P  ( yes i know its just an example )
[21:00:53] <Eviltwin> A lot more time consuming
[21:01:03] <Eviltwin> Well bad for two reasons
[21:01:19] <Eviltwin> One because it's not a CSS3 pseudo selector
[21:01:24] <Eviltwin> It's a Sizzle one
[21:01:35] <Eviltwin> And because it's equivalent to [type=checkbox]
[21:01:38] <Eviltwin> Which is an attr selector
[21:01:53] <Eviltwin> Which is one of the slowest types of CSS3 selector
[21:02:33] <danzik17> yup.  the second can be sent to qSA, the first can't.  should be filtering on input[type...] anyway of course
[21:02:43] <Eviltwin> Yup
[21:02:55] <Eviltwin> So it was a contrived example :P
[21:03:03] <someprimetime> that sucks
[21:03:10] <someprimetime> in the RTL example mentioned above
[21:03:33] <danzik17> yea but as dumb as it is, i've done the same thing and seen people actually use my BS examples in projects
[21:03:38] <Eviltwin> It's why you should be aware
[21:03:42] <someprimetime> i didn't know attr was a css3 selector?
[21:03:46] <danzik17> then i'm like no! :(
[21:04:15] <pooja> Hello
[21:04:17] <someprimetime> i typically only use [type=] thought
[21:04:30] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Still no faster than any other attr AFAIK
[21:04:34] <danzik17> it's not, it's CSS2
[21:04:35] <danzik17> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#attribute-selectors
[21:05:24] <someprimetime> interesting
[21:06:02] <Eviltwin> danzik17: For the purposes of helping people understand, I've included $("*").bind("click", function() { console.log(this.nodeType) })
[21:06:07] <Eviltwin> In some example code
[21:06:25] <Eviltwin> Guess what ended up in production
[21:07:02] <danzik17> apparently code that hadn't been peer reviewed =P
[21:07:19] <Eviltwin> Not reviewed by me for sure :P
[21:07:28] <Eviltwin> Not sure about my coworkers
[21:07:39] <Eviltwin> It's the danger of snippets
[21:08:43] <danzik17> eh, my biggest issue is:  1.  people still don't use jshint.    2.  don't copy and paste my examples, keep the damn code DRY, ktksbai.
[21:09:51] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: is there a reason you put that in there?
[21:10:02] <someprimetime> as it just counts any click?
[21:10:15] <Eviltwin> Because they didn't understand how the event bubbling was happening
[21:10:16] <someprimetime> i mean quantitatively is it useful for something in particular?
[21:10:19] <Eviltwin> Especially with .delegate
[21:10:19] <someprimetime> ah
[21:10:35] <Eviltwin> There was a lot going on in the page
[21:10:40] <Eviltwin> And it was getting canceled somewhere
[21:10:57] <someprimetime> ah gotcha
[21:10:59] <someprimetime> makes sense
[21:13:01] <someprimetime> danzik17: word on DRY
[21:13:08] <someprimetime> never heard of jshint though
[21:13:27] <danzik17> jslint?
[21:13:29] <someprimetime> oh it's just jslint?
[21:13:41] <someprimetime> yeah crockford's thing
[21:13:46] <danzik17> as someone stated, it's jslint with less crocklamations.
[21:13:55] <someprimetime> haha ncie
[21:13:58] <someprimetime> nice, rather
[21:14:18] <someprimetime> i've been using jsfiddle more and more for stuff
[21:14:28] <someprimetime> it's quite nice to be able to get feedback/clean up syntax/use jslint on it
[21:14:58] <someprimetime> but of course when i'm on a production server in a branch within a vim screen it's a little difficult to do so
[21:15:29] <danzik17> well, that begs the question - why are you coding on a production server?
[21:16:30] <Eviltwin> 'Cause there's no development and deployment process? :P
[21:16:38] <danzik17> That's the ticket.
[21:16:43] <someprimetime> why did i say production
[21:16:45] <someprimetime> meant dev
[21:16:59] <someprimetime> i'm too much of a noob to be doing that
[21:17:23] <danzik17> "I don't always write javascript, but when I do, I do it in production" - The most interesting man in the world.
[21:18:39] <danzik17> if this is a dev server - A.  i think there's a vim jslint plugin, but not 100% since im below even newb in vim  B.  install node.js and the jshint module from there to run it
[21:19:21] <Eviltwin> "I don't always write code, but when I do, I do it in production so I can see the results right away." -Someone who doesn't understand dev
[21:20:23] <danzik17> don't worry about it.  my editor has undo.  that's almost as good as source control.
[21:20:25] <someprimetime> danzik17: yeah, it's no worries. i'll just copy and paste and run it through jslint (or now jshint)
[21:20:34] <someprimetime> yeah, escape+u
[21:20:36] <someprimetime> ctrl+r
[21:20:37] <someprimetime> fine for me
[21:20:42] <danieliser> trying to replace commas and i get no return if i try .replace(',',' ');
[21:21:12] <someprimetime>  /sarcasm
[21:21:25] <someprimetime> everyone always hates on me for using vim
[21:21:32] <someprimetime> i appreciate it though
[21:21:35] <someprimetime> i started with vi
[21:21:53] <Eviltwin> Learn emacs :P
[21:21:54] <someprimetime> vim was like graduating to getting an actual license. you can still drive, but it's more fun
[21:22:07] <someprimetime> ha! sounds like all my co-workers
[21:22:24] <danzik17> eh, screw both of em.  notepad++ for me.
[21:22:36] <someprimetime> looks foreign to me every time i look around and then they come to help me out and go "well let me see if you can do this emacs command in vim…. oh guess not"
[21:22:44] <danieliser> any ideas?
[21:22:46] <someprimetime> i use netbeans for my personal stuff though
[21:22:59] <lanmower> ahem...
[21:23:01] <someprimetime> but then again i use php for my personal stuff and pylons @ work
[21:23:04] <lanmower> http://jquery.hohli.com/
[21:23:07] <lanmower> o.O
[21:23:09] <someprimetime> back on topic
[21:23:51] <someprimetime> that looks really ugly
[21:24:02] <someprimetime> i'm not a fan of people trying to bind two languages together
[21:24:24] <danieliser> nobody?
[21:24:27] <lanmower> while I'm well aware of this. . .
[21:24:45] <someprimetime> danieliser: what are you replacing?
[21:24:48] <lanmower> don't you think its quite amazing how the syntax remains so pure?
[21:24:49] <someprimetime> commas with what?
[21:25:02] <danieliser> it is the .val() of a text input
[21:25:17] <danieliser> spaces
[21:26:10] <danieliser> do i need to convert it to a sting somehow?
[21:26:19] <lanmower> at the moment I've got all my javascript squished out of the project in client libraries. . . this makes me wonder how neccesary that really is.
[21:26:39] <lanmower> not that I'd just use it but still. lol
[21:39:54] <jstonne> hahaha, crocklamations.
[21:41:15] <abstrusenick> is it possible to change doctype with javascript after the page has been rendered?
[21:44:02] <danieliser> how can i strip the space off the end? does trim work?
[21:44:22] <Cork> ?.trim
[21:44:22] <bot-t> jQuery.trim(str): Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[21:44:33] <danieliser> kewl.. knew the answer to my own question
[21:49:10] <context> is there a check/uncheck event or do i just bind to click and check for :checked ?
[21:49:31] <Eviltwin> The latter
[21:49:34] <context> kk
[21:49:49] <context> <4 thnx
[21:53:26] <zarf> Hi
[21:53:29] <zarf> Suppose $(this) is the table row tr at http://paste.pocoo.org/show/530228/
[21:53:36] <lrvick> hey all. I am trying to create an array of jquery 'LI' objects, then populate them all into a UL in one go with a $('<ul>',{html: li_objects})
[21:53:38] <zarf> I can extract 'Mountain View' as $(this).find('td').eq(1).text()
[21:53:41] <lrvick> but it seems that does not... work
[21:53:46] <lrvick> whats the right way to do it?
[21:53:48] <zarf> but how do I extract 'http://google.com'?
[21:53:58] <zarf> (I've tried things like $(this).find('a').eq(0).attr('href') to no avail.)
[21:54:32] <lrvick> zarf: that should be pretty straight forwward
[21:54:37] <lrvick> can you jsfiddle an exmaple?
[21:54:56] <zarf> yeah it ought to... but not for me apparently
[21:55:37] <Cork> zarf: $(this).find('a').attr('href') should work just fine
[21:56:09] <Eviltwin> lrvick: I'd do something like var ul = $("<ul>"); $.each(li_data, function(i, data) { $("<li>",{text:data}).appendTo(ul) });
[21:57:43] <zarf> Cork: mmmh, at least that gives *some string*, but not the one I expected. Let me investigate
[21:58:45] <Cork> zarf: how many columns and how many links do you have in your table row?
[21:59:37] <zarf> Cork: more than in the example I posted :(
[22:00:48] <zarf> Cork: so I think your suggestion gives me an array.
[22:00:50] <zarf> (I put your suggestion in a variable s and added alert(s) but this gives me a bunch of successive alerts with *parts* of urls in each)
[22:03:13] <lrvick> Eviltwin: that works then.
[22:03:16] <lrvick> guess thre is no nicer way
[22:03:19] <lrvick> thanks :-)
[22:14:26] <xananax> Hello,I have a weird situation here; I am defining a custom event: "next.sslider":function(evt,disable){}; and I am triggering it through $wrapper.trigger('next.sslider',disable); disable is a jquery collection. If I console.log() before line 1, it is still a jquery collection; but inside the event function, it becomes a normal dom node
[22:14:43] <xananax> before first line: "[a.previous #, a.next #]"
[22:15:05] <xananax> then the trigger gets called; in the trigger: "<a class="previous disable" data-sslider="previous" href="#" title="previous">"
[22:15:14] <xananax> is this expected behaviour?
[22:17:48] <lincolnn> quiet night
[22:18:12] <Cork> xananax: the parameter to trigger should be an array, each of them will be its own argument to your event listner
[22:18:19] <context> wow FML !
[22:18:20] <context>         apply      = parent.find('input[id$=_amount'),
[22:18:26] <context> i just wasted a half hour
[22:18:43] <context> i told myself after doing this like 5 times yesterday to LOOK FOR THE DAMN ]
[22:19:05] <xananax> Cork: Oooh I had not caught this. Thanks a lot
[22:19:29] <Cork> context: jet another reason to always quote your attribute values in selectors
[22:20:06] <context> cork? jquery will complain ?
[22:20:26] <Cork> context: no, but 1. its MUCH easier to catch
[22:20:45] <context> well, i started using vim a couple days ago instead of textmate as my primary editor
[22:20:52] <Cork> 2. sometimes the selector will fail cause the text in it conflics with selectors (not applyable in this case)
[22:20:57] <context> i never had this issue with textmate. for some reason vim doesn't put the closing ] in there
[22:21:02] <context> but it does everywhere else
[22:31:24] <danieliser> how would i prevent a form from being submitted when a user presses enter in a specific box?
[22:32:32] <Cork> danieliser: you would have to catch keycode 13 and preventDefault the event
[22:32:45] <danieliser> tyvm Cork
[22:32:55] <danieliser> thats what i needed i believe..
[22:33:23] <danieliser> its e.preventDefault correct?
[22:33:31] <Cork> yes
[22:33:35] <danieliser> ty again
[22:33:39] <Cork> you need to do it on each input element though
[22:33:57] <Cork> or rather as a delegate or on (depending on version of jquery)
[22:35:00] <danieliser> no i am writing an autocomplete plugin for an app im working on. got up/down buttons cycling through returned results but when pressing enter the form submits instead of doing what i setup enter to do
[22:39:45] <zarf> lrvick, Cork: actually $(this).find('a').eq(0).attr('href') was working, what was wrong was later in my code
[22:39:53] <zarf> Pardon the noise, and thanks for the suggestion to make a minimal example -- that's how I sorted it out
[22:41:13] <lrvick> :-)
[22:41:24] <lrvick> i do similar often
[22:50:09] <mehrdad_> hey guys
[23:03:05] <mehrdad_> how do u define a new referenc with the same name as another one and add the previous functionality to the new one as well?
[23:03:33] <Eviltwin> What?
[23:03:34] <mehrdad_> i mean kind of like inheritance mechanism in OO languages C# etc
[23:03:40] <Cork> mehrdad_: a new reference to what?
[23:03:58] <mehrdad_> see, it is a reference to a function i guess
[23:04:01] <mehrdad_> it is like this
[23:04:02] <Cork> mehrdad_: your talking about jquery plugins?
[23:04:09] <mehrdad_> window.Date= function() {
[23:04:14] <mehrdad_> or it is a return type
[23:04:17] <jstonne> you're probably talking about object prototypes
[23:04:18] <mehrdad_> yes
[23:04:22] <mehrdad_> yes yes
[23:04:41] <mehrdad_> in another library there is a date object
[23:05:17] <Cork> mehrdad_: window.Date = function Date() {} should give it the correct name
[23:05:30] <mehrdad_> and that date object is assigned with a return value of a function later
[23:05:37] <nocturnal> if I'm using .append to add html code. then that html code does not seem to be covered by my document.ready. do I need to use onclick for example to tie an event to it?
[23:05:46] <mehrdad_> ah
[23:05:47] <mehrdad_> let me see
[23:06:39] <jstonne> the moment you append the html code, it exists within the DOM, then you bind the click event to the element.
[23:06:51] <jstonne> so on click is unnecessary.
[23:07:05] <jstonne> document.ready is irrelevant.. unless the element that you're appending to doesn't exist yet.
[23:07:16] <jstonne> which means you have another problem beforehand.
[23:07:35] <mehrdad_> Cork: there is a function defined in the Date object early on
[23:07:43] <mehrdad_> in the datejs library
[23:07:59] <mehrdad_> and the jq plugin modifies the Date object like i said above
[23:08:08] <jstonne> anyway mehrdad_: function contractors / prototypes. if you read that one up, you''ll understand how it works.
[23:08:10] <mehrdad_> that function now is undefined
[23:08:13] <jstonne> constructors*
[23:09:04] <Cork> mehrdad_: i'm not sure what it is your trying to do
[23:09:38] <Cork> mehrdad_: if the funtion is undefined its not accessable unless you have the old original function ref stored
[23:09:58] <aro> has anyone seen this error with datepicker? Cannot modify properties of a WrappedNative
[23:10:38] <jstonne> var someClass = function(n) { this.value = n; return this; };  someClass.prototype.increment = function() { this.value++; return this };  var instance = new someClass(1);  x.increment(); console.log(x.value); // returns 2
[23:11:17] <hendry> I want to match a PRE element with a class like: class="brush: js; class-name: 'jsbox';highlight: [2]"
[23:11:20] <hendry> How do I do that?
[23:11:32] <mehrdad_> Cork, yeah i guess it is stored in a var in the modifying function, but the names i guess conflict, let me put a sample in pastebin
[23:12:00] <Cork> mehrdad_: better if you use jsfiddle or jsbin
[23:17:12] <mehrdad_> Cork, sorry i did it already,k hope it is clear http://pastebin.com/WtGTVnSE
[23:17:38] <mehrdad_> ah hold on
[23:17:41] <mehrdad_> one moment plz
[23:17:45] <mehrdad_> gotta edit it
[23:19:52] <Cork> mehrdad_: window.Date.prototype = $._gDate.prototype; should work
[23:20:40] <Cork> hmm but... that looks wrong...
[23:20:59] <Cork> this.prototype = $._gDate.prototype; should put the prototype on the wrong element
[23:21:13] <Eviltwin> You may have difficulty overwriting built-in objects and object prototypes
[23:21:28] <Eviltwin> Sometimes it doesn't like it when you try to tamper with those
[23:21:33] <Cork> ya
[23:21:38] <Cork> but i think this is even worse
[23:21:48] <aro> why would my datepicker object not function? i can see that it has the 'hasDatepicker' class - but when I click on it, nothing happens
[23:21:55] <Cork> i think it actually puts the Data.prototype on window.prototype
[23:22:04] <Eviltwin> Gotta go, best of luck
[23:23:23] <mehrdad_> Cork, a little tidy up http://pastebin.com/biJZrL1c
[23:23:55] <mehrdad_> yeah i guess it has something to do with prototypes
[23:24:24] <mehrdad_> the window.Date object is used by the datejs library for its own functions like parseExact
[23:24:26] <Cork> mehrdad_: the first lib needs to load first
[23:24:46] <Cork> else your code, as it looks will fail
[23:25:20] <mehrdad_> let me play with ordering
[23:25:38] <mehrdad_> but i guess there is dependency stuff which will break it
[23:25:40] <Cork> the internal variable $D will point to the original object, and you can't update it without modifying the lib
[23:25:45] <mehrdad_> let me check it tho
[23:26:53] <mehrdad_> the original object which is Date is modified in the jq plugin file right?
[23:27:18] <mehrdad_> i mean the function definition in the jq file
[23:28:26] <Cork> mehrdad_: no its replaced
[23:28:47] <Cork> mehrdad_: the first library replaces it, the second one stores a ref to the old one
[23:29:58] <mehrdad_> first is datejs, and second is jquery plugin which has this line window.Date= function Date() {
[23:30:23] <Cork> mehrdad_: i meant in the order you put it in the paste bin
[23:30:31] <mehrdad_> ok
[23:31:00] <mehrdad_> so i have to correct the replace stuff in the jq plugin
[23:31:24] <mehrdad_> window.Date should have the functionality of the old one
[23:31:30] <mehrdad_> the functions and stuff
[23:32:40] <mehrdad_> changing their loading orders breaks the whole thing down
[23:32:46] <Cork> mehrdad_: if the first lib in your pb loads first
[23:32:50] <Cork> everything should work
[23:33:09] <Cork> cause then the second lib will store a pointer to the correct lib
[23:36:41] <mehrdad_> there are lots of dependency between js files
[23:36:45] <mehrdad_> and there are many of them
[23:36:58] <mehrdad_> changing orders raises more errors
[23:37:03] <mehrdad_> i cant do that
[23:37:19] <mehrdad_> it takes time even if it is possible
[23:37:23] <Cork> then you need to patch the libs
[23:37:37] <mehrdad_> cant i just correct the reference pointer stuff
[23:37:38] <mehrdad_> ?
[23:37:47] <Cork> no as the varaible is internal
[23:37:58] <Cork> you don't have access to it outside the lib
[23:38:05] <Cork> the problem is var $D
[23:38:26] <mehrdad_> w8, let me think about it
[23:39:53] * dr0id w8's
[23:40:31] <mehrdad_> see, what i want to do is this: add the functionality of the old Date object to the new one which is replaced by the function return value, something like newdate+=date thing
[23:41:39] <mehrdad_> there are loads of stuff going on in the damn js libs, datejs jquery prototypes and json....it is confusing
[23:41:57] <mehrdad_> mainly because i have little familiarity with them
[23:42:10] <mehrdad_> so is it possible to do something like above?
[23:44:54] <mehrdad_> see http://pastebin.com/hZqnchqD
[23:45:14] <mehrdad_> that is that prototype thing anyway?
[23:45:51] <mehrdad_> shouldnt it add just the older obj methods to the new one at this line? 			this.prototype = $._gDate.prototype;
[23:47:37] <Soopaman> anyone here good with regex patterns?
[23:49:55] <beasty> morning
[23:50:24] <beasty> mm i think i'm doing somthing wrong
[23:50:36] <mehrdad_> Cork, sorry man, i almost know shit about js
