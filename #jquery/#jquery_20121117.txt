[01:05:02] <cisforcojo> hey guys, i'm creating a table (one week in a calendar) and want to drag and drop batch tickets onto it for a production plan. Any ideas on how I might generate the table and then add the 'batch ticket' divs onto it, snapped to the respective 'td' because on 'start date'?
[01:05:12] <cisforcojo> it's a bit complex and i'm not sure where to begin
[02:26:56] <eimer> Hey
[02:31:13] <eimer> Im trying to make a draggable div, which revert to the first-startposition, if it was dragged to the left. Otherwise it should be normally draggable. http://jsfiddle.net/HuQD4/2/ << There are 2 Problems. I cant drag the div more than one time and there is nothing revert.
[02:50:09] <molavy> i using bootstrap using jquery
[02:50:54] <molavy> i want create trigger when popover hide
[02:51:03] <molavy> and do some actions
[02:51:09] <molavy> any idea?
[02:51:55] <molavy> something like : $(".popover").on("hide",function(...
[02:52:01] <molavy> any idea?
[02:53:03] <molavy> there is no idea how can i detect something hide
[02:53:23] <molavy> i use this :
[02:53:23] <molavy> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#popovers
[02:53:44] <molavy> and show up a form element
[03:00:27] <molavy> there is no idea?
[03:14:59] <Guest21584> i dont think there is a "hide" event
[03:15:12] <Guest21584> so you wont be able to bind that
[03:15:53] <Guest21584> you probably have to trigger the tooltip when you hide the element
[03:16:15] <Guest21584> how what triggers the hide molavy?
[03:22:41] <anew>  http://jsfiddle.net/UmjDS/7/ can someone tell me what 'e' is here in line 3? i dont understand (jq noob)
[03:26:56] <anew> pls anyone
[03:29:01] <anew> please jesus
[03:29:58] <_zoggy_> event
[03:30:20] <_zoggy_> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:30:35] <_zoggy_> if you look there you can see all the arguments of .on inside the function
[03:31:47] <anew> _zoggy_ very noob question here - why is event needed to be passed as an argument here ?
[03:32:07] <_zoggy_> if you want to act upon it
[03:32:33] <anew> http://api.jquery.com/category/Events/?rdfrom=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.jquery.com%2Fmw%2Findex.php%3Ftitle%3DAPI%2F1.3%2FEvents%26redirect%3Dno
[03:32:35] <anew> so this list
[03:32:41] <anew> every single one needs an event parameter ?
[03:32:47] <_zoggy_> no
[03:33:02] <_zoggy_> if you removed that console line that prints out what it is.. you wouldnt need to have it
[03:33:31] <_zoggy_>             file.onload = function(e) {
[03:33:31] <_zoggy_>                 $(img).attr('src', e.target.result).aeImageResize({
[03:34:35] <_zoggy_> its just basic coding, if you plan on using it.. you need to define it so when its passed you can reference
[03:35:20] <anew> if i remove the console line i dont even need it ?
[03:35:46] <anew> i thought it was mandatory for on()
[03:40:01] <anew>  http://jsfiddle.net/y38X5/ i guess here is as simple as it gets.......function(event) event = the event object that gets executed... where is that objct ?

[04:30:11] <Croves> Hello
[04:30:12] <Croves> Hey guys. I have a lot of inputs, and I have to get all the values and separate it with commas. Is there a easy way to do this w/ jQuery?
[04:49:32] <eimer> Im trying to make a draggable div, which revert to the first-startposition, if it was dragged to the left. Otherwise it should be normally draggable. http://jsfiddle.net/HuQD4/2/ << There are 2 Problems. I cant drag the div more than one time and there is nothing revert. The same concept is used here: http://timeline.verite.co/ If you're trying to drag the timeline befor year 1880 it reverts you to 1880.
[04:49:47] <eimer> any ideas?
[04:59:28] <eimer> ? :(
[04:59:29] <bot-t> :(
[05:03:19] <renown> I have a distributed deployment of 30+ server hosting special purpose applications, i'm planning to write a GUI that can send / receive control messages to/from these 30+ hosts, these controls range from very low-level operations to any complex queries. Is jQuery accurate for such accomplishments?
[05:06:56] <shoky> eimer: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/HuQD4/6/
[05:09:12] <ShawnRisk> I have slides of the slideshow all overlay ontop of each other when this loads, is there a way to fix this? I want to just see the first slide once everything loads not the slides ontop of each other.  Here is a jsfiddle of the full code: http://jsfiddle.net/FEXAQ/20/
[05:09:14] <eimer> shoky, wow! Not bad. But if you drag it first to right and THEN to left, there is no revert.
[05:09:45] <shoky> eimer: because you don't reset the 'startleft' position..
[05:10:04] <shoky> you only set it once in the 'create' callback
[05:11:20] <eimer> Ahhh yes. Thanks a lot shoky :)
[05:12:00] <shoky> eimer: http://jsfiddle.net/HuQD4/7/
[05:12:55] <eimer> yeah!!
[05:18:37] <ne14u> i have questions about jquery documentation page, and i'm looking for someone who have permissions on wiki
[05:21:14] <ShawnRisk> shoky: did you see my question?
[05:21:26] <ShawnRisk> ask?
[05:21:32] <ShawnRisk> ne14u: just ask
[05:24:23] <ne14u> ShawnRisk: i translated http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries this article, but i cannot edit this page, because seems its protected now.
[05:24:46] <ne14u> I am looking someone to reopen that page for edit, or edit it for me
[05:24:56] <ShawnRisk> ok
[05:26:34] <ShawnRisk> ne14u: I have no access to that
[05:27:17] <ShawnRisk> ne14u: did you put your question up on #jquery-dev ?
[05:27:44] <ne14u> ShawnRisk: Okay, thank you for your effort. I searched a page like http://codex.wordpress.org/Documentation_team this one
[05:27:53] <ne14u> to see team members and contact with them, but i didnt found.
[05:28:25] <ShawnRisk> ne14u: try the other room
[05:28:29] <ne14u> okay
[05:34:00] <shoky> ShawnRisk: use css to fix that
[05:34:55] <ShawnRisk> shoky: yes but how?  If you want me to move to the css room I can do that
[05:35:06] <shoky> display:none ?
[05:35:09] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/G3Ex5/4/ - how do I show all non-sponsored posts normally? I.e. with no cycling, like http://reddit.com
[05:36:23] <ShawnRisk> shoky: on which element?
[05:37:28] <shoky> ShawnRisk: the ones you don't want displayed.. the slides other than the first..
[05:38:11] <ShawnRisk> shoky: isn't that jquery?  Like saying destory the others that are not active?
[05:38:33] <shoky> huh?
[05:38:46] <shoky> jquery doesn't have a say as to what is displayed on page load
[05:39:00] <shoky> that's html+css
[05:39:19] <shoky> well, you could do inline js but nevermind that
[05:39:42] <ShawnRisk> shoky: let me try what you said
[05:42:56] <ShawnRisk> shoky: okay I believe it is working now but on load the first slide loads and the first image of the slide takes a few seconds to load.  How do I load the slide after the image is loaded?
[05:50:05] <ShawnRisk> shoky?
[05:58:04] <shoky> ShawnRisk: sorry kinda busy. you prolly need to adapt the code a bit to work with the css you added, donno
[05:59:29] <ShawnRisk> shoky: okay thanks

[07:41:47] <alex12> in the example the data variable is being returned but i tried returning count also and it didn't work either
[07:42:09] <batmanbond3d> are you getting the data in your PHP script
[07:42:31] <alex12> if i paste the function in my dev console i get an array of items back
[07:42:32] <batmanbond3d> like are you getting { 'action' : 'getProdcuts' }

[07:53:15] <jessica> Need help, want to use this json list-funiks.com/invoice/phonebook/dropdown-ajax/get-list.php?getlist=contactname       in my jquery code
[07:53:21] <jessica> can any1 help me ?
[07:53:29] <johnkpaul> ?getJSON @jessica
[07:53:30] <bot-t> jessica, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[07:53:32] <jessica> my jquery code-http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[07:54:18] <johnkpaul> jessica: take a look at this example http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[07:56:48] <jessica> this is embarrasing i know, but as i am new, i am wondering instead of search.php, shall i copy my url ? http://funiks.com/invoice/phonebook/dropdown-ajax/get-list.php?getlist=contactname  ?
[07:57:48] <johnkpaul> jessica: you should try that and see what happens
[07:58:02] <jessica> kk
[08:00:58] <jessica> johnkpaul :: its coming undefined aka undefined
[08:01:09] <johnkpaul> jessica: what is "it"?
[08:01:53] <jessica> here-http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote   just replaced search.php with http://funiks.com/invoice/phonebook/dropdown-ajax/get-list.php?getlist=contactname
[08:02:16] <johnkpaul> jessica: you copied and pasted that code to your own domain?
[08:02:45] <jessica> my php code has Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
[08:02:54] <johnkpaul> jessica: the json returned from your PHP does not conform to the correct frmat
[08:02:56] <jessica> so i have just made a test.html page on my laptop
[08:03:04] <johnkpaul> jessica: read the autocomplete docs, it explains
[08:03:20] <johnkpaul> it says you need something like {value:"", label:""}
[08:03:31] <jessica> but i am using the same to accompilsh another task
[08:03:46] <jessica> check this out-  http://jsfiddle.net/h5gH6/
[08:04:23] <johnkpaul> jessica: so why can't you change the JSON?
[08:05:31] <jessica> in jsfiddle example its working right and the format is also correct i am sure
[08:07:20] <dblosevn> jessica: that service doesnt apear to support jsonp
[08:08:05] <jessica> its supporting, u need to select onload and jquery 1.7.2 on left side
[08:08:25] <dblosevn> jessica: http://funiks.com/invoice/phonebook/dropdown-ajax/get-list.php?getlist=contactname&callback=test
[08:08:37] <dblosevn> its not wrapping the packet in a callback
[08:09:09] <jessica> [{"contactname":""},{"contactname":""},{"contactname":""},{"contactname":""},{"contactname":""},{"contactname":""},{"contactname":"Yuuii"},{"contactname":"From mob"},{"contactname":"Agh"},{"contactname":"saurabh"},{"contactname":"a"}]
[08:09:10] <johnkpaul> dblosevn: it doesn't need to be jsonp, jessica says she setup CORS
[08:09:19] <dblosevn> oh got you
[08:09:33] <dblosevn> i came in after that i guess
[08:09:37] <jessica> this is the correct answer, i just copied
[08:09:48] <jessica> so my php url is returning correct
[08:10:08] <jessica> need to join that result here-http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[08:10:51] <johnkpaul> jessica: after your first json call, change your "obj" on line 5 of your fiddle and change it into what's needed to create the autocomplete
[08:12:10] <jessica> shall i follow jsfiddle or the url, u gave me  ?
[08:12:46] <johnkpaul> jessica: both?
[08:12:48] <johnkpaul> I don't realy know what you mean
[08:13:16] <jessica> jsfiddle is a dropdown example i made
[08:13:23] <jessica> and its working fine
[08:13:35] <jessica> now i want to make an autocomplete
[08:13:42] <jessica> with same php result url
[08:14:03] <johnkpaul> jessica: oh, you're getting rid of the current one that is working fine?
[08:14:05] <johnkpaul> you don't nee dboth?
[08:14:35] <jessica> :) noo, i want to make a fresh new autocomplete from my url
[08:18:20] <johnkpaul> jessica: then why not change your php to match what jquery ui is expecting?
[08:18:49] <jessica> its exactly like that i believe
[08:20:01] <johnkpaul> jessica: no, it's not
[08:20:01] <johnkpaul> jessica: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[08:23:26] <dblosevn> jessica: http://jsfiddle.net/tAPwD/
[08:24:02] <johnkpaul> :) yes! that ^ @jessica
[08:24:15] <johnkpaul> if you can change the JSON, don't know if that's the best way to go, but it'll work
[08:24:42] <jessica> its working
[08:24:59] <dblosevn> jessica: duh i did it my stuff always werks :-P
[08:25:21] <jessica> isnt it ?? now still you think i need to change the json
[08:26:35] <dblosevn> jessica: you should change your response to match what autocomplete epects being you were unwilling i wrote a hack to morph your jason packet to a packet the autocomplete accepts, this is uneeded and you should change your response
[08:28:12] <dblosevn> JesseC: your returning [{name: value}, {name:value}] when autocomplete expects [value,value]
[08:28:23] <dblosevn> grr @jessica not JesseC
[08:29:00] <jessica> kk
[08:29:02] <jessica> got it
[08:29:26] <jessica> dblosevn, ou got my pm ?
[08:30:06] <dblosevn> hmm maybe she want my number :-)
[08:30:35] <johnkpaul> ha
[08:30:40] <johnkpaul> jessica: don't PM without asking
[08:31:26] <johnkpaul> jessica: dblosevn is right, and I agree with him, if you can change your PHP, you should, hacking it on the frontend doens't make sense if nothing else relies on the old PHP
[08:31:56] <jessica> got it
[08:36:52] <dblosevn> grr this is pissing me off, http://sebringrealtor.com/ theres 2 sliders on this page both work but if they are both activated at the same time it screws up the animation on the second one and it stops in the wrong place
[08:36:57] <hitesa> are there any IT consulting companys in the USA, firms that sell you to big companys and pays you bad (outsourcing)?
[08:37:34] <dblosevn> ill gladly sell you to a big comapny and pay you bad
[08:38:01] <dblosevn> lmao
[08:38:45] <hitesa> how outsourcing works in the US?
[08:39:06] <hitesa> it company sells you to bmw at 500$ day
[08:39:14] <hitesa> and pays you 100$
[08:39:15] <hitesa> ?
[08:39:33] <hitesa> are there only direct contracts in US ?
[08:40:17] <dblosevn> well thats a different kind of outsourcing, but yes bmw pays 500 and the firm pays you maybe 50-60 bucks
[08:40:31] <EvoGamer> outsourcing works the same the world over, only the pricing is different
[08:40:48] <hitesa> in portugal
[08:41:12] <pachet> in soviet russia, work outsources you
[08:41:13] <hitesa> 100% consulting companys on the capital
[08:41:32] <dblosevn> lol @pachet
[08:42:00] <hitesa> outsources you to BNP-PARIBAS at 400euros days and pays you 1100euros month
[08:42:01] <hitesa> lol
[08:42:10] <hitesa> outsources you to BNP-PARIBAS at 400euros day and pays you 1100euros month
[08:42:35] <dblosevn> anyways totally off topic lol whats this have to do with #jquery lmao
[08:42:36] <hitesa> and you stay there  1years 2 years 3 yeas...
[08:42:44] <EvoGamer> hitesa: it's that same practices across the EU and most of the world
[08:43:58] <hitesa> people in IT almost cant leave with 1100 euros in lisbon a room costs 300 euros
[08:44:00] <hitesa> lol
[08:44:44] <dblosevn> anybody got any ideas on where to start on my problem?
[08:45:19] <dblosevn> im thinking the first slider is stopping all the animation timers and its prematurely stopping the second slider in the process
[08:53:33] <dblosevn> well what the hell, thats not the problem at all now all my sliders are wrong, the first tick is right then every tick after is just a little more off
[08:53:44] <dblosevn> they all worked perfectly last night
[09:06:51] <hitesa> IT companies pay well in US?
[09:09:01] <pachet> lol
[09:24:24] <Cameron_> how do i attach one element to another that moves?
[09:24:33] <Cameron_> so that when one moves the other follows it?
[09:28:08] <jessica> its there any way to safeguard .js code ????
[09:28:46] <Foxhoundz> safeguard?
[09:29:02] <Foxhoundz> You could obfuscate your code, but I don't see any need
[09:29:19] <Foxhoundz> Chances are, if you have sensitive logic in your code that shouldn't be seen by users
[09:29:22] <Foxhoundz> push it to the server
[09:29:33] <jessica> but people can download js
[09:29:58] <jessica> or say it like, i have to give html and js files to my client, now i dont want him to see my code
[09:30:18] <jessica> now can i decode it so that it can never be seen ?
[09:30:34] <Foxhoundz> Oh...so you're doing a web design for a client but you don't want them to poach your work before paying up, eh?
[09:30:59] <Foxhoundz> Well, the only way I can think of is to simply obfuscate the code or just provide screenshots.
[09:31:10] <jessica> its not like this
[09:31:24] <jessica> i am making an invoice app for my client but i dont want him to get the code
[09:33:06] <Foxhoundz> Well, he's going to have access to the code regardless of what you want. You can take measures to make it harder to decode by obfuscating it and throwing dummy logic to throw them off, but they will have access to it since it's a JS is a client side language.
[09:33:43] <Foxhoundz> since JS is a client side language*
[09:34:57] <jessica> how can i obfuscate it ?
[09:37:21] <Foxhoundz> jessica, there are packers and minifiers out there. But there is always the possibility that the code might be restored to its original state
[09:37:33] <Cameron_> how do i attach one element to another that moves?
[09:37:59] <Cameron_> it's a draggable element
[09:38:06] <Cameron_> i want another div to follow it when it's moved
[09:38:09] <jessica> hmmmm
[09:47:21] <Foxhoundz> Cameron_, something like this: http://jsbin.com/uyisap/2/ ?
[09:48:42] <enderx86> (seeing how the html channel is dormant): i have an <input type"submit" value="sort"> button and the text ('sort') displays to the lower right of the button, as opposed to being centered, such that some of it is even cut off. How do I fix this?
[09:49:24] <enderx86> imho this should not be default behavior.
[10:00:39] <shoky> ?demo @ enderx86
[10:00:40] <bot-t> enderx86, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[10:08:15] <mackzor> ah ok
[10:09:28] <mackzor> jsfiddle is for javascripting online?
[10:10:44] <mackzor> okay, so i need help, no image load on http://jsfiddle.net/ESv5K/1/ any1?
[10:12:46] <mackzor> nvm, chat is sloooooooooow :[ hehe,i'll google
[10:14:05] <Foxhoundz> mackzor, check your console
[10:18:55] <DeltaHeavy_> mackzor: Please only come here for help after you've exhausted other available resources (Google). Also, IRC isn't meant to be like an MSN IM conversation.
[10:19:45] <wroathe> He left.
[10:20:04] <DeltaHeavy_> Derp, didn't see that.
[10:20:07] <Foxhoundz> Interesting
[10:20:12] <Foxhoundz> And here I was fixing up his code
[10:20:14] <Satoebbi> DeltaHeavy_ : i still here wirth my question. can you help how can i google forward to find answers?
[10:20:15] <Foxhoundz> his loss :<
[10:21:52] <DeltaHeavy_> Satoebbi: Find the tool you need, and figure out how to use it to accomplish your task. I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to do anyway.
[10:34:23] <Satoebbi> so, i have this code. working well, but i want to change the height of - in example - the 1st and the 5th element. http://jsfiddle.net/mQAp2/
[10:35:00] <Satoebbi> can i do without if/els and adding one more line?
[10:37:23] <Satoebbi> i hope there is some other function near slice() to do that.
[10:42:37] <wroathe> Satoebbi: use eq in your selector or something like that
[10:43:04] <wroathe> http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[10:44:10] <wroathe> It's good that people come to irc to ask questions but my god some of this code is bad.
[10:44:12] <Satoebbi> as i find eq can't do that
[10:44:54] <Satoebbi> yes wroathe, we are learning..
[10:47:43] <eltoro> hey guys i know i'm completely off topic, but really don't know who to ask for … can someone tells me if is there any slang or smaller word/phrase to say "one hand washes the other"

[10:56:22] <wroathe> Satoebbi: Yours is good too.
[10:56:29] <wroathe> I thought you specifically needed just the 3rd and 5th element.
[10:56:29] <Satoebbi> thx 4 help
[10:56:38] <wroathe> Satoebbi: But if nth child does what you want perfect.
[10:56:52] <Satoebbi> oh. i see

[11:03:08] <eltoro> :)) ciao guys!
[11:05:31] <dblosevn> wroathe: .filter is used when there isnt a selector already that will select what you need
[11:25:43] <mihi> I found several references in forums about jqueryui themeroller becoming open source, but I cannot find the source? Didn't it become open source?
[11:26:29] <mihi> if not, what is the preferred way of giving users/tenants a way to change some colors of the theme? create multiple w/ themeroller and diff them to find where to change the colors?
[11:40:07] <karolyi> did any of you experienced the weird behaviour of webit based browsers that a form gets submitted if there's only one input element and a disabled submit button?
[11:40:49] <karolyi> i mean, by pressing enter on the input widget
[11:41:16] <karolyi> however, when i have more than one input elements in a form with a disabled submit button, it does nothin on pressing enter
[11:41:23] <karolyi> safari/chromium
[11:45:00] <mihi> karolyi: most browser submit forms with ony one input element even if there is no submit button at all (search forms) but don't do so if there is more than one
[11:45:40] <karolyi> mihi: is that behaviour specified somewhere? because firefox does not behave that way
[11:45:56] <karolyi> test here: http://jsfiddle.net/9LQM6/1/
[11:46:43] <dblosevn> karolyi: cant say i have had that problem, you could try $('form').submit(function() { if ($(this).find('input[type="submit"]').prop('disabled')) { return false; }});
[11:47:56] <karolyi> dblosevn: actually i want to submit in any case, i have an onsubmit event bound to the submit where i handle things, but my problem is that webkit submits twice when i bind a submit to the enter keypress
[11:48:34] <dblosevn> do that, after submitting the first time then
[11:48:41] <dblosevn> or before doesnt matter
[11:48:57] <dblosevn> that will only stop the submit if the button is disabled
[11:49:09] <dblosevn> the button wont be disabled on the first goaround
[11:49:15] <dblosevn> it will be on the second
[11:49:30] <dblosevn> so it will stop the second post
[11:50:39] <dblosevn> also i only get one alert in chrome
[11:50:45] <karolyi> checking if the form is submitted the second time is an awful workaround, i thought i could handle this more userfriendly but as it seems, i will need that workaround
[11:51:36] <karolyi> dblosevn: the jsfiddle was only to test out if the form gets submitted if it has only one element. try it with firefox
[11:51:42] <dblosevn> has nothing to do with userfriendlyness as the user doesnt see the code, another workaround would be to throw a hidden element in the form
[11:53:56] <karolyi> well if that's the case, then firefox has a faulty implenetation
[11:54:00] <dblosevn> ya that is weird, i tried disabling the form as well and that didnt work either
[11:54:17] <dblosevn> firefox lost all my trust after there 9 releases last year
[11:54:25] <abletony84> hmmmm
[11:54:55] <dblosevn> how a broswer goes from version 6 to 18 in one ear still baffles me
[11:54:58] <karolyi> okay, so i will need to build the workaround in
[11:55:07] <dblosevn> *year
[11:55:30] <karolyi> dblosevn: i got into development with firefox plugins recently too... it's a nightmare, i can tell
[11:55:52] <dblosevn> ya, i used to do plugins for firefox but there api changes so much its not worth it anymore
[11:56:35] <karolyi> okay, so i think we know who's really responsible for the incompatible workflow here
[11:56:46] <dblosevn> its not me lol
[11:56:47] <karolyi> thanks anyway
[11:57:22] <karolyi> i thought there's something wrong with chromium, but as it came out, it's firefox, again :/
[11:57:32] <dblosevn> ya, ive had the opposite problem in the past before, trying to get submit on enter to work without a button
[11:58:17] <karolyi> you can do that easily, bind a keypress event on the input event, and then element.closest('form').submit()
[11:58:38] <karolyi> *input element
[11:59:00] <dblosevn> ya didnt want to do a keypress though, thats how i solved it though
[11:59:06] <mihi> karolyi: sorry, apparently opening another firefox when already 1.8 of 1GB RAM is used is enough to get my machine swap to death :D
[11:59:37] <karolyi> i have a real complicated widget code built up anyway for my customized input elements (capslock sensing, more difficult design, etc), it was easy to implement there
[11:59:37] <dblosevn> thats the other reason i nuked firefox its memeory management is like non existant
[11:59:43] <mihi> anyway, IE does submit the form, Opera and Firefox do not. If there is no submit button at all (not even a disabled one) all 3 browsers do submit :D
[12:00:38] <karolyi> mihi: it's not the submit button what's really important, it's the thing what happens on pressing the enter
[12:01:24] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/G3Ex5/4/ - how is it possible to show all non-sponsored posts outside of the whole cycling thing, just like http://reddit.com?
[12:01:30] <karolyi> a second really annoying thing is in gecko, that a disabled submit button does not emit _any_ event
[12:02:26] <karolyi> i would really glad to use a f'in click event, but i solved it anyway
[12:02:55] <abletony84> karolyi: im glad u did
[12:03:54] <karolyi> abletony84: if you're not interested, then it's not for you.
[12:04:23] <abletony84> karolyi: but some people are forced to be interested in it due to the circumstances
[12:04:50] <abletony84> right?
[12:04:58] <abletony84> i mean, it's called a job
[12:05:36] <karolyi> abletony84: and other people are smart enough to ignore it, as i was in the middle of a conversation. obviously, thats not you.
[12:06:58] <dblosevn> karolyi: ya this is the only way i could get it to work http://jsfiddle.net/q4FSz/
[12:09:04] <dblosevn> karolyi: I would expect a disabled element not to fire any events
[12:09:18] <dblosevn> as it is disabled
[12:09:22] <karolyi> dblosevn: in webkit, they do
[12:10:19] <dblosevn> thought you just said they didnt
[12:10:54] <dblosevn> oh nevermind misread your statement
[12:11:13] <dblosevn> but still i would expect a disabled element to be disabled
[12:11:23] <karolyi> dblosevn: well what you achieved here is the counterpoint what i want to do but this is also a good solution. i will need the submit event in any case, with the disabled submit button, but with the check-double-submit workaround i'll be able to achieve it
[12:12:09] <dblosevn> although the problem your having isnt the submit button firing click and propagting the click to the forms submit handler
[12:12:19] <karolyi> dblosevn: it is disabled, for example clicking on the disabled submit button won't submit the form, but you can catch the click event anyway
[12:12:35] <karolyi> dblosevn: yes, it was another topic
[12:12:38] <dblosevn> on enter the forms submit handler is being fired bypassing the submit buttons click handler
[12:13:52] <karolyi> dblosevn: you mean the jsfiddle example? not when it has more input elements
[12:14:26] <karolyi> (and the submit button is disabled)
[12:14:48] <dblosevn> weird
[12:14:57] <dblosevn> the buttons click handler is fired onenter
[12:15:03] <dblosevn> as well as submit
[12:15:11] <jerkface03> What's the proper way to remove a child element from its parent?
[12:15:21] <dblosevn> but when the button is disabled its click handler doesnt fire
[12:15:25] <karolyi> jerkface03: child.remove()
[12:15:27] <jerkface03> $("#childElemId").remove()?
[12:15:31] <jerkface03> k
[12:15:39] <dblosevn> karolyi: http://jsfiddle.net/q4FSz/1/
[12:15:46] <karolyi> dblosevn: you mean you get the onclick event?
[12:15:54] <dblosevn> in chrome theres no click fired once the button is disabled
[12:16:12] <dblosevn> click it clear the alerts then click it aain
[12:16:18] <dblosevn> the alerts dont fire
[12:16:51] <dblosevn> which is what i would expect
[12:16:52] <karolyi> oh shit
[12:16:54] <karolyi> wait
[12:17:25] <karolyi> not when there's a <span> child in the button element, that's what jquery ui's button does
[12:18:09] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/q4FSz/2/ same effect
[12:18:41] <karolyi> hm, something's weird then here
[12:18:46] <karolyi> give me a sec, testing
[12:19:29] <karolyi> hmmm
[12:19:38] <karolyi> thats really weird
[12:19:54] <senorc> whats wrong?
[12:21:28] <joshsmith> has anyone tried doing anything with jQuery inside Gmail?
[12:21:51] <dblosevn> joshsmith: that would problly be a clusterfuck lmao
[12:22:06] <ajpiano> i have
[12:22:11] <dblosevn> joshsmith: id definitely noconflict it before attempting anything
[12:22:14] <Lexflex3000> Hi
[12:22:18] <ajpiano> i wrote a chrome extension for gmail
[12:22:27] <joshsmith> ajpiano: I'm trying to do the same atm
[12:22:30] <Lexflex3000> (offtopic) is anyone here using dasKeyboard with blue switches?
[12:22:37] <joshsmith> is it as big a PITA as I'm imagining it will be?
[12:22:48] <ajpiano> nope
[12:22:57] <ajpiano> there's definitely some weird quirks to being in there
[12:23:12] <ajpiano> joshsmith: i built http://www.cirrusinsight.com/ for a client
[12:23:16] <jerkface03> How do I check if a dom element is not attached to the document in JQuery? Or maybe even not attached to a certain element? .parent()?
[12:23:33] <joshsmith> ah yes, heard of it
[12:23:37] <ajpiano> oh , rad
[12:23:43] <ajpiano> yeah, that actually has the same codebase for chrome and ff
[12:24:04] <joshsmith> I can't even trigger a click event
[12:24:28] <ajpiano> that was actually one of the the things i remember being tricky
[12:24:56] <joshsmith> or, similarly, listen on certain events
[12:25:02] <karolyi> dblosevn: ah yes, i got it
[12:25:19] <ajpiano> joshsmith: yeah, i think they are stopping a lot of event propogation themselves, likely
[12:25:21] <karolyi> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/q4FSz/4/ , try clicking on the submit button with firefox and then wit webkiy
[12:25:24] <karolyi> *webkit
[12:25:28] <joshsmith> that's what I figured
[12:25:33] <ajpiano> i remember the process being a lot of hit-and-miss
[12:25:42] <ajpiano> trying to remember what we worked out for simulating events
[12:26:13] <Foxhoundz> jsfiddle is limited in the number of libraries you can preload with it
[12:26:14] <dblosevn> karolyi: the click event is being bubbled to document
[12:26:16] <Foxhoundz> why not use jsbin?
[12:26:30] <karolyi> dblosevn: yes, but ont with firefox/gecko
[12:26:34] <karolyi> *not
[12:26:36] <dblosevn> karolyi: that is expected as you are clicking on the document
[12:28:01] <ajpiano> joshsmith: quite frankly, i remember our approach being mostly trying to "read" from gmail, and adding our own things into it
[12:28:09] <ajpiano> but not trying to "get it to do stuff"
[12:28:25] <dblosevn> karolyi: just means firefox implemented it differently, techinically chrome does it right, the button is disabled does not fire any events, the document is not disabled it does fire events
[12:28:38] <joshsmith> ajpiano: right, that seems fairly straightforward
[12:28:41] <ajpiano> also i worked on it in may of 2010 so it's been awhile
[12:28:44] <joshsmith> but actually getting it do stuff doesn't
[12:29:19] <karolyi> dblosevn: yes, that's what i expect too, but as it seems firefox is either buggy, or they just have an other understanding how disabled elements should behave
[12:29:50] <karolyi> and i was really PC now
[12:29:59] <dblosevn> karolyi: I would never bind a click event to the document though so its doubtful i would have that problem, if your concerned with the behavior submit a bug
[12:32:09] <karolyi> dblosevn: i did it to handle a blur on my input widget which had more than one html elements within, to set the element defocused when it is clicked outside of these elements... but i rewrote it already, it seems working now without binding to click events on the document
[12:33:01] <karolyi> dblosevn: still i think that the i should get the click event on the document level, to disabled elements
[12:33:07] <karolyi> -the
[12:35:46] <karolyi> i have a friend who has a developer friend at mozilla, and he's also using chromium to develop :)
[12:35:52] <dblosevn> karolyi: thats hard to say on one hand i would expect to get the click at the document level and on the other i dont
[12:36:31] <dblosevn> id be curious what the w3c specs say about that
[12:37:00] <karolyi> dblosevn: well in my opinion, it should bubble up, even on disabled elements
[12:38:56] <karolyi> i did a search on it in bugzilla, the first result: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329509
[12:39:45] <karolyi> reported in 2006 :D

[12:48:34] <dblosevn> lol
[12:49:41] <railer> okay, so basically i have a site with some content, and i want too catch that content and put it in a .html file, but i really have no clue how to do this. i red about the load() thingy, but obviously that does only work on the same sever
[12:52:04] <karolyi> railer: are you able to modify the other sites http headers?
[12:52:25] <railer> nope, it's just a site like google or youtube
[12:52:51] <karolyi> railer: then you will need to do this with a backend, php for example
[12:52:58] <railer> i want to do this, because i want to be able to sort the things of the site out i'm not interested in

[12:53:31] <railer> but how? i red something about setting up a proxy, but again, i have know idea how
[12:53:42] <dblosevn> @railer
[12:53:56] <karolyi> railer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3506208/jquery-ajax-cross-domain
[12:54:24] <dblosevn> karolyi: he wants to do more then proxy it, he wants to scrape the data modify it and then return it
[12:54:58] <abletony84> hey at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/G3Ex5/3/ how do i unhide all non-sponsored li's?
[12:55:05] <karolyi> dblosevn: can be done in backend and frontend too... but the pulling of the data should be done in backend
[12:55:09] <dblosevn> karolyi: the proxy is the first step but he needs to learn how to write a screen scrape so he can do the mods
[12:55:40] <dblosevn> I would never write a clientsided scrape lol no need to put all that work on the client
[12:56:07] <railer> okay, i should have told you that im not aware of php or js
[12:56:21] <dblosevn> ?learn @railer
[12:56:22] <bot-t> railer, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[12:56:23] <karolyi> railer: then you're gone have a hard time
[12:56:30] <karolyi> *gonna
[12:56:32] <dblosevn> then learn php
[12:56:45] <railer> dblosevn thats what i wanna do here, right?
[12:57:40] <dblosevn> no were here to help you when you have problems, were not here to teach you a language, it is assumed if you are here you have at least a basic understanding of javascript and jquerye
[12:57:55] <mowol> im trying to do this on my own page http://jsfiddle.net/utQZ7/ - but on my page i always get an error that the requested content can't be loaded. Any ideas?
[12:59:02] <railer> yes i have, i know the basic stuff about php, but this cross site request is just breaking my back, i'm not able to deal with it, because this is the more advanced stuff
[12:59:59] <karolyi> railer: you should write a php scipt that fetches the url at the server side, and give the result to your javascript code in response of your ajax call to the php scipt
[13:00:27] <karolyi> mowol: does #box have the box id after applying the fancybox?
[13:00:47] <railer> and why can't i just export the content in a JSON and import it then again via jquery?
[13:00:52] <mowol> karolyi yes
[13:01:05] <karolyi> mowol: then its the css
[13:01:29] <karolyi> mowol: remove the display:none after applying fancbox
[13:01:33] <mowol> karolyi thats why i want to use the content parameter. It works fine if i use the href parameter, but then the css affects the result
[13:01:45] <dblosevn> mowol: you should use a code repo that allows hotlinking
[13:02:00] <dblosevn> this is forbidden: http://fancybox.net/js/fancybox-1.3.4/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.js
[13:02:22] <karolyi> oh yes, okay
[13:02:42] <karolyi> railer: export json from where?
[13:02:55] <mowol> dblosevn its only for the fiddle
[13:03:12] <dblosevn> http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fancybox/2.0.4/jquery.fancybox.pack.js allows hotlinking
[13:03:14] <railer> from the site i want to fetch the content, or isn't that possible?
[13:05:43] <karolyi> railer: you can't access another site from your JS code, unless you are able to apply the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header on the other side, which you apparently aren't
[13:06:55] <dblosevn> mowol: http://jsfiddle.net/utQZ7/2/
[13:07:11] <railer> oh okay, so i've understand that thing know (: i'm gonna try some things out with the suggestions you made and hopefully get something thats working like it's supposed to (: thanks for your help (;
[13:07:41] <mowol> dblosevn interesting
[13:09:44] <mowol> dblosevn i cant get that to work
[13:09:51] <karolyi> glad to be a help
[13:10:03] <dblosevn> ?demo @mowol
[13:10:04] <bot-t> mowol, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:10:31] <dblosevn> youll have to show me your code thats not working, i cant just guess what your doing wrong
[13:11:52] <mowol> dblosevn the problem is all the other things going on, on the site im afraid
[13:12:21] <abletony84> anybody able to help and i will make them a song?
[13:12:30] <dblosevn> mowol: exactly my point if i cant see your problem in context no one will be able to provide you a solution
[13:12:54] <mowol> dblosevn it wasnt meant like that, sorry. Im just fed up with problems on this site, and this site in general
[13:13:00] <karolyi> abletony84: :D wait
[13:14:41] <dblosevn> abletony84: ask, before i leave already lmao
[13:15:03] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/G3Ex5/4/ - how is it possible to show all non-sponsored posts outside the whole cycling thing, like on http://reddit.com?
[13:15:10] <dblosevn> suns almost off my tv so i can almost play black ops 2 again
[13:15:16] <abletony84> I'll put the song up on http://soundcloud.com/abletony84 later today
[13:16:45] <anew> i have some on page jq that is not clearing on cache when i refresh the page, what do i do ?
[13:17:22] <karolyi> abletony84: i don'w know reddit.com, do you want to copy the non-sponsored classes out of the structure?
[13:18:03] <anew> anyone ?
[13:18:34] <abletony84> karolyi: well the jquery cycle plugin hides all my li's so i can cycle back and forth between them (like reddit.com's sponsored posts at the top there)
[13:19:00] <abletony84> karolyi: i'd very much like it to only hide and cycle my li's with the "sponsored" class
[13:19:55] <abletony84> (i guess i could make two uls, one for sponsored and one for regular, but that'd complicate the backend side of things)
[13:20:02] <karolyi> abletony84: then i think it's easier to remove the sponsored classes from the dom, before the cycler gets initialized (or maybe afterit, too)
[13:20:52] <mowol> dblosevn i have version 1.3.4 of fancybox.. Maybe i should just update it
[13:21:26] <karolyi> abletony84: there you have it: http://jsfiddle.net/G3Ex5/5/
[13:21:29] <abletony84> karolyi: ill look into that thanks
[13:21:35] <abletony84> hey now
[13:22:38] <karolyi> anew: be more precise pls
[13:22:50] <abletony84> karolyi: the sponsored posts should be cycled, the non-sponsored posts should display normally below
[13:23:08] <karolyi> abletony84: i see.. wait
[13:23:28] <dblosevn> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/gKku4/1/
[13:23:39] <mowol> dblosevn now its working. Updated the version and rearranged the elements. Thanks for your help buddy
[13:23:57] <dblosevn> mowol: np
[13:23:59] <anew> karolyi i have <script>  $(document).ready(function () { console.log('hello'); }); </script>  ... if i change console.log to 'this' or anyting else, and hit refresh i still see 'hello' in the console.......
[13:24:00] <abletony84> there we go!
[13:24:10] <anew> i dont know why when i hit refresh the js is not updating
[13:24:37] <dblosevn> abletony84: would have been far easier if non sponsered had a class
[13:24:46] <karolyi> yep
[13:24:57] <dblosevn> abletony84: its way easier to find something then it is to not find something
[13:25:20] <abletony84> oh i see
[13:25:50] <karolyi> anew: it's a html caching problem then, not a jquery one
[13:26:00] <abletony84> but there'll only be like 2-3 sponsored posts vs 2-3.000 non-sponsored posts, not sure how i feel about adding a class to all of those
[13:26:06] <karolyi> anew: try hitting shift-refresh
[13:26:20] <karolyi> anew: that reloads the cache too
[13:26:26] <abletony84> bless you guys though dblosevn and karolyi ill make something nice for both of you, hold up
[13:27:23] <anew> still didnt do it
[13:27:24] <anew> so weird
[13:27:49] <dblosevn> now for some black ops 2
[13:28:28] <dblosevn> well
[13:28:31] <dblosevn> actually
[13:28:39] <dblosevn> it works withonly sponsered having a class
[13:28:39] <karolyi> abletony84: you can use the inverse selector for finding the li's not having the sponsored class: $('li:not(.sponsored)')
[13:28:43] <anew> lol nevermind , officially an idiot
[13:28:46] <anew> as if i wasnt before lol
[13:30:16] <abletony84> karolyi: great thanks for that
[13:33:44] <abletony84> karolyi: any special elements u want in your song?
[13:34:02] <dblosevn> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/XH5Za/
[13:34:08] <dblosevn> like that forinstance
[13:34:14] <karolyi> abletony84: not necessary to create anything, support is free:)
[13:34:50] <dblosevn> that way you dont loop 3k elements you only loop the sponsered ones
[13:35:37] <dblosevn> you were approaching it backwards, you always want the least reps possible, so put all the posts in another ul then move the sponsered ones to the cyle
[13:35:38] <abletony84> thank you so much guys
[13:36:15] <abletony84> oh indeed
[13:36:56] <dblosevn> my last example does just that
[13:37:12] <abletony84> :)
[13:37:33] <abletony84> words cant express my gratitude though so ill do my best to express it through music
[13:37:39] <abletony84> any special elements u want in your song dblosevn?
[13:37:51] <dblosevn> not really a trance guy
[13:37:51] <karolyi> the guy got hooked up on ableton
[13:37:54] <abletony84> maybe something from black ops 2? :)
[13:38:14] <dblosevn> im more house / d&b / dub
[13:38:17] <abletony84> dblosevn: i dont make trance
[13:38:40] <abletony84> karolyi: hehe you guessed right
[13:38:48] <brettfrable> http://progrium.com/localtunnel/
[13:38:51] <brettfrable> so useful
[13:39:12] <dblosevn> i clicked through some of your stuff sounded kinda trancy i usually save that stuff for when i roll lmao
[13:39:26] <dblosevn> i tried to get into that stuff
[13:39:27] <abletony84> dblosevn: could probably try house / d&b / dub for you np
[13:39:42] <dblosevn> spent 1300 on a bad ass controller
[13:39:52] <dblosevn> spent 3 weeks trying to make a wobble and gave up
[13:39:53] <abletony84> haha nice
[13:40:23] <dblosevn> i guess i found out later you need another effects controller to make a wobble
[13:40:33] <karolyi> huh? what for?
[13:40:59] <karolyi> i use no controllers, i mean i don't have them here... they're 800km away from me
[13:41:26] <abletony84> sweet, so both of u are producers?
[13:41:26] <dblosevn> the ddj-t1 doesnt support the effects required to make a wobble
[13:41:45] <brettfrable> dblosevn - you can make a wobble easily.
[13:41:48] <karolyi> abletony84: just a hobbist one... http://soundcloud.com/karolyi
[13:41:59] <dblosevn> and i wanted to get into dub, and failed
[13:42:10] <brettfrable> you don't even need a controller
[13:42:15] <abletony84> interesting
[13:42:18] <brettfrable> just a copy of ableton / fruity loops
[13:42:20] <brettfrable> and massive
[13:42:22] <brettfrable> and your set
[13:42:27] <karolyi> indeed
[13:42:28] <dblosevn> everybody i saw used external effects to acheieve it
[13:42:31] <abletony84> yes
[13:42:35] <brettfrable> just use massive
[13:42:42] <abletony84> or ableton's own operator
[13:42:47] <brettfrable> it's so easy.
[13:42:51] <brettfrable> some stuff i've done
[13:42:55] <brettfrable> residoom.bandcamp.com
[13:42:55] <karolyi> dblosevn: you just need to know the theory of it, how it is generated, and basicly thats it... plenty of tutorials on youtube
[13:43:10] <dblosevn> i was using traktor with the ddj-t1
[13:43:18] <brettfrable> check out my stuff
[13:43:20] <brettfrable> dblosevn
[13:43:25] <brettfrable> residoom.bandcamp.com
[13:43:41] <dblosevn> i got close, but not like you can do with a cdj and effects board
[13:43:49] <brettfrable> this is probably the best thing i ever did - http://residoom.bandcamp.com/track/nxtlvl
[13:44:11] <dblosevn> need to go out to my truck lol
[13:44:16] <dblosevn> laptop doesnt do it justice
[13:44:23] <karolyi> dblosevn: which effect did you missed for the dubby feeling?
[13:44:26] <brettfrable> no no - it probably doesnt
[13:44:43] <dblosevn> need phaser, high cut
[13:45:10] <Jimmv> brettfrable:  is good
[13:45:17] <brettfrable> http://residoom.bandcamp.com/track/new-jack
[13:45:19] <dblosevn> could isolate the wobble but bot control the speed of the phaser
[13:45:19] <karolyi> i'm not into dubstep
[13:46:13] <dblosevn> the effects controller in traktor is lacking
[13:46:18] <karolyi> although i did a track once, as an online content for a book
[13:46:42] <karolyi> dblosevn: i guess you mean dubstep, not dub :)
[13:46:43] <brend_> dblosevn: who are u dancing with?
[13:47:09] <dblosevn> karolyi: was unaware there was a difference
[13:47:27] <dblosevn> brend_: you if your boobs are big enough?
[13:47:36] <brend_> lol
[13:48:02] <brend_> i got a new bra
[13:48:18] <dblosevn> now i have some pretty serious dubstep/d&b tracks live out in cali
[13:48:32] <dblosevn> acidently found this underground club in LA was the shit
[13:48:42] <brend_> Are u in comolombia?
[13:48:53] <dblosevn> i was all upstairs and they had a 2 man country band
[13:49:36] <brettfrable> what y'all think of this
[13:49:37] <brettfrable> http://3rnp.localtunnel.com/
[13:49:38] <dblosevn> i was so almost ready to leave and we walked out the backdoor, and boom there was techno, i followed the techno to the basement and it was huge
[13:49:39] <karolyi> dblosevn: dub is more relating to reggae
[13:49:47] <brettfrable> and for the record
[13:49:49] <brettfrable> dubstep is dead.
[13:49:53] <brettfrable> check out TNGHT
[13:49:58] <dblosevn> suuuure it is lol
[13:50:20] <brettfrable> http://soundcloud.com/tnght
[13:50:26] <dblosevn> most everybody i know spins d&b, but they all do a few dubstep tracks
[13:50:32] <brettfrable> http://soundcloud.com/baauer
[13:50:36] <karolyi> i don't know if dubstep is dead, never liked it, so never cared to listen to it :)
[13:50:41] <brettfrable> those are two of my faves right now
[13:50:54] <brettfrable> not really dubstep
[13:50:57] <brettfrable> but absolutely awesome.
[13:51:08] <brend_> shitty music
[13:51:17] <brettfrable> not at all.
[13:51:29] <brend_> rock and roll is real music
[13:51:57] <brend_> and justin bieber
[13:52:01] <brend_> lol
[13:52:31] <karolyi> not to mention direction one
[13:52:34] <dblosevn> wow, your banner that name isnt allowed to be spoken here
[13:52:43] <karolyi> or whatever they're called
[13:52:45] <dblosevn> direction one? lmao
[13:52:49] <brend_> haha
[13:52:49] <brettfrable> direction one is awesome!
[13:52:50] <dblosevn> one direction maybe
[13:52:59] <brend_> erection one
[13:53:14] <brettfrable> one erection!
[13:53:17] <karolyi> the amount of lameness is really high
[13:53:25] <dblosevn> but what if i got more then one erection?
[13:53:28] <brettfrable> karolyi - check out my band.

[14:03:21] <dblosevn> i almost went to rio this year :-(
[14:03:31] <karolyi> brettfrable: is it really your band?
[14:03:35] <dblosevn> didnt have my passport on me
[14:03:40] <brettfrable> yeah
[14:03:47] <brend_> what have u visited in south america
[14:04:32] <karolyi> brettfrable: Unfortunately, this video is not available in Germany because it may contain music for which GEMA has not granted the respective music rights.
[14:04:34] <dblosevn> nothing, would have been my first trip, Caterpillar did an event in rio, and they were having issues with some software I wrote so they were gonna fl me out there to fix it
[14:05:16] <dblosevn> i was already on vacation in florida though and forgot my passport
[14:05:25] <karolyi> this is the point where the proxying starts.
[14:05:58] <brend_> i suggest colombia
[14:06:13] <brend_> heaven of beers and girls
[14:09:46] <brend_> i just realized i have a really good spaguetti code haha
[14:10:14] <karolyi> some say, callbacks are the new goto
[14:13:56] <dblosevn> brend_: theres such a thing?
[14:14:10] <brend_> dblosevn: yaap
[14:14:26] <dblosevn> brend_: then you will never write anything for me lmao
[14:14:53] <brend_> dblosevn: i know im too newby
[14:15:18] <dblosevn> im hungry
[14:15:34] <karolyi> welcome to the club
[14:15:40] <brend_> grab some food dude
[14:16:02] <dblosevn> bout too, maybe an asian hooker while im at it
[14:16:13] <brend_> hahaha
[14:16:28] <brend_> dont tell me u dream with asian girls?
[14:16:41] <dblosevn> i try not too do much dreaming when im with em
[14:16:52] <brend_> haha
[14:17:10] <brend_> well theres a lot of asian ppl in america
[14:17:32] <dblosevn> you dont say
[14:18:11] <brend_> think i will get the Xperia S
[14:24:09] <brend_> dblosevn: got a new one for you.. if i need to initialize an autocomplete field when i clone a new row should i need to use event delegator? cuz its only initializing when the page loads
[14:25:04] <dblosevn> if its a new autocomplete, id just initalize it when you clone the row
[14:25:32] <brend_> im doing that
[14:25:55] <dblosevn> $('selector').clone().autocomplete(...
[14:26:11] <brend_> actually im doing this
[14:26:20] <brend_> http://jsfiddle.net/4XZMb/953/
[14:26:56] <brend_> at the end when i append the row autocompleteSo($('#tableSo tr').eq(numberExistingRows - 1));
[14:28:06] <dblosevn> brend_: id just do it when you clone the row
[14:28:16] <dblosevn> no need to go find what you already have all overagain
[14:28:35] <brend_> what do you mean
[14:29:37] <Cameron_> add image dynamically not loading
[14:30:22] <dblosevn> autocompleteSo($row); @brend_
[14:31:14] <brend_> instead of autocompleteSo($('#tableSo tr').eq(numberExistingRows - 1)); ?
[14:31:29] <dblosevn> ya thats just silly
[14:31:39] <brend_> let me see
[14:31:41] <dblosevn> being you already have a reference to the node in $row
[14:32:55] <dblosevn> and i thought we went over this the other day id is a prop not an attr
[14:33:16] <brend_> dblosevn:  yes i have changed that
[14:33:25] <brend_> its an old fiddle
[14:33:48] <brend_> changed to classes
[14:35:04] <brend_> dblosevn:  if i say u are the man.. u are the man
[14:35:17] <dblosevn> im the man anyways
[14:35:31] <brend_> not at night
[14:35:38] <dblosevn> it is night
[14:35:39] <EvoGamer> of course, if you're not, then you're not :P
[14:35:53] <axyz> helloo
[14:36:00] <axyz> sorry for double o
[14:36:04] <dblosevn> ooleh
[14:36:10] <dblosevn> *oolleh
[14:36:24] <axyz> i am using slickgrid which uses jquery for dom manipulation
[14:36:42] <dblosevn> i swear  that said stickgrid lmao
[14:37:37] <axyz> my problem is that sometimes the viewport width is not computed well; they're using this formula
[14:37:43] <axyz> viewportW = parseFloat($.css($container[0], "width", true));
[14:38:05] <axyz> this line looks very strange; it's like a set of width but with value true ?
[14:38:16] <axyz> and the result it;s the actual width ?
[14:40:23] <dblosevn> im not even seeing $.css as a function
[14:40:52] <dblosevn> I know $('selector).css is a function but cant find docs on jQuery.css
[14:41:22] <axyz> if used with 3 values it acts like a setter
[14:42:35] <dblosevn> im thinking that, but not understanding why set width to true
[14:43:07] <axyz> me neither
[14:43:10] <dblosevn> eg why i was trying to see if there were docs for $.css that differed from jQuery(selector).css
[14:43:19] <axyz> and this line ruins everything
[14:43:40] <axyz> when i hide the grid this line returns a width of 1.931... instead of 1371
[14:43:50] <dblosevn> eg.. like $.each is completely different from $(selector).each
[14:44:26] <axyz> http://api.jquery.com/css/#css2
[14:44:27] <tw2113> $.each() you have to pass in manually what to iterate over
[14:44:30] <dblosevn> try removing the line and using meta viewport
[14:44:39] <tw2113> $(selector).each iterates over the matching selectors
[14:44:54] <dblosevn> tw2113: I know that im just saying they are 2 different functions for 2 different tasks
[14:45:02] <tw2113> :)
[14:45:05] <tw2113> just helping clarify
[14:45:25] <dblosevn> tw2113: i was hoping to find different documentation for $.css
[14:45:36] <NielsNL> Hello, i hoop this is the right place to ask this question on development: For a big project we would gladly use the selectable widget. Sadly there some (reported) bug's that we see, that is a no go for the project. I have read that the fixes should be done in version 2.0. Is there anyway you can do some of them a bit faster then that... i think we can setup some funding for this.
[14:45:37] <dblosevn> as i have never seen it used like that
[14:45:57] <axyz> i know
[14:46:55] <dblosevn> axyz: try removing that line or commenting it and <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"> add that to the head of your document
[14:47:43] <dblosevn> let the browser determine the width of the viewport
[14:49:28] <dblosevn> axyz: it also doesnt make sense that they appear to be setting the width and returning the value they set it
[14:49:51] <dblosevn> which really leads me to believe $.css has a different behavior then we expect
[14:52:31] <axyz> yes; looks very strange but the guy from slickgrid is very good and probably he knows something
[14:54:38] <jerkface03> Anyone know how to prevent wrapping in a jquery mobile text area?
[14:54:58] <EvoGamer> hi guys, I'm trying to .load() an XML file, but I need it to respect the newline chars in the XML (rather than rely on <br/>). Any ideas how I can do this?
[14:55:23] <dblosevn> hmm css: function( name, value ) { is defined but also css: function( elem, name, numeric, extra )
[14:56:46] <k1ng> 5w
[14:57:10] <dblosevn> so there definitely is 2 different behaviors for $(selector).css vs $.css
[14:57:46] <k1ng> 5w
[14:58:37] <k1ng> 5w
[14:58:41] <dblosevn> $.css(element, name, true returns a float
[14:59:17] <dblosevn> $.css(element, name, false returns an int
[15:03:55] <dblosevn> so in short he is not setting a value to width he just specifying that he wants a float back from width
[15:06:34] <axyz> ok
[15:06:44] <axyz> so so the line is correct then
[15:06:51] <dblosevn> ya
[15:07:09] <dblosevn> container[0] just isnt the right width
[15:07:43] <dblosevn> or maybe because its hidden and hasnt been rendered yet, it cant accurately compute the width
[15:08:31] <axyz> well, i have the list page, then dbl click on some element and the edit page (other div) is shown; after getting back to list page, the width changes ...
[15:08:36] <axyz> don't know why
[15:09:57] <dblosevn> is the "edit page" a child of the list?
[15:10:24] <dblosevn> might be what ever lightbox like plugin your using to display the div screwing with the width
[15:10:50] <dblosevn> when it is closing
[15:11:30] <axyz> edit page and list page are separate divs; no parent-child relationsho[
[15:12:12] <dblosevn> dunno then i still think it has something to do with when the edit div closes, its changing something in the grid
[15:12:57] <dblosevn> is this a jquery mobile project?
[15:13:17] <axyz> most probably when the edit page closes something bad is happening; it;s not mobile
[15:14:02] <dblosevn> im lost without seeing it ive done all i can :-) and learned something too i guess, dont know if ill ever use it though lol
[15:14:50] <axyz> ;) thanks; i have a deeper look tomorrow to see what's happening when the edit page closes
[15:15:51] <dblosevn> but hey i rememebr telling my math teacher id never use algebra too lmao
[15:17:01] <axyz> :)
[15:19:21] <EvoGamer> I always wondered why my Teacher was talking about Al G's Bra
[15:19:45] <axyz> have a good day/night
[15:19:47] <axyz> bye
[15:22:01] <EvoGamer> hi guys, I'm trying to .load() an XML file, but I need it to respect the newline chars in the XML (rather than rely on <br/>). Any ideas how I can do this?
[15:22:25] <dblosevn> EvoGamer: was anware algae had a bra
[15:22:59] <dblosevn> dont think you can @Evogamer
[15:23:30] <enderx86> I want to send the contents of a text area to a web service, and render the returned HTML. Can I do this with the following code: http://pastebin.com/GBDjBDLM? Is this the best way to do it?
[15:23:36] <dblosevn> youd have to convert newlines to br on the server
[15:23:54] <dblosevn> xml collapses whitespace
[15:24:42] <dblosevn> if the whitespace is in there you can try outputting to a pre tag
[15:25:42] <dblosevn> enderx86: ya that will work
[15:25:56] <enderx86> is it the best way?
[15:26:06] <enderx86> p.s. thanks for looking at my code
[15:26:55] <dblosevn> its clean enough, i tend to use the shorthand methods for that but they do the same thing in the end
[15:28:10] <enderx86> what are the shorthand methods?
[15:28:32] <dblosevn> could be written as $.post('/sort', {list: $('textarea').val()}, function (ret) { $('div').html(html); }, 'html');
[15:28:56] <enderx86> oh, i've never used the $.post function
[15:28:58] <dblosevn> sorry $('div').html(ret);
[15:29:13] <dblosevn> its just shorthand for what you did
[15:29:19] <enderx86> what's the advantage of $.ajax over $.post if you're doing a POST request?
[15:29:30] <dblosevn> does the exact same thing just less code
[15:29:34] <dblosevn> hence shorthand
[15:29:39] <enderx86> hehe i see, thanks
[15:30:11] <dblosevn> $,ajax also gives you the failure hook where $.post does not
[15:30:35] <enderx86> oh, interesting
[15:30:46] <enderx86> i see there is also a $.get, do you ever use that?
[15:30:59] <dblosevn> ya when i dont need to post :-)
[15:31:12] <enderx86> i see, so it's another shorthand for $.ajax
[15:31:16] <dblosevn> yes
[15:31:42] <dblosevn> same exact syntax
[15:32:14] <dblosevn> $.get(url, {/*params*/}, callback, returntype
[15:32:32] <enderx86> cool, thanks
[15:32:49] <enderx86> i feel like i'm learning jquery function by function, haha
[15:33:06] <dblosevn> i also use $.ajaxStart and $.ajaxStop a lot
[15:33:25] <dblosevn> to make global loading screen handlers
[15:34:11] <dblosevn> coupled with blockUI its insane, automatically blocks and unblocks the screen while doing ajax requests
[15:35:28] <dblosevn> eg like $.ajaxStart(function() { $.blockUI(); }); $.ajaxStop(function() { $.unblock(); });
[15:36:22] <batmanbond3d> dblosevn: Wow, and I made my own blockUI because I didn't know such a thing existed, learn a lot from reading responses here
[15:36:54] <dblosevn> ya blockUI is awesome, even has a growlUI option
[15:37:03] <batmanbond3d> what is that?
[15:37:09] <dblosevn> like the growl notifications in osx
[15:38:06] <dblosevn> http://www.malsup.com/jquery/block/#demos
[15:38:10] <enderx86> okay, so my form isn't exactly submitting properly. it ends up re-directing to /?sort=Sort&random_list_size=. is there something wrong with this form? here it is: http://pastebin.com/vSeFtBvC
[15:38:12] <dblosevn> scroll down to growl
[15:38:17] <dblosevn> then click run
[15:38:20] <enderx86> (combine that with my above jquery in pastebin)
[15:39:28] <batmanbond3d> dblosevn: that is a cool tip
[15:41:14] <dblosevn> enderx86: what am i looking at?
[15:41:29] <dblosevn> your orginal paste wont do anything as sort is not an html element
[15:41:33] <rhizmoe> hi all, can i use multiple selectors the same as i do in css? something like $("input#foo, input#bar")... ?
[15:41:52] <dblosevn> $('sort').submit(f should be $('form').submit(f
[15:42:06] <enderx86> dblosevn: it's a form that submits a list to a web service. the web service sorts it and returns it in formatted html
[15:42:11] <brend_> god.. this is working bad
[15:42:29] <enderx86> dblosevn: the jquery i showed you controls the 'sort' button's submit, sending the list to the web service
[15:42:33] <dblosevn> again sort is not an html element
[15:42:48] <rhizmoe> nm, shoulda googled.
[15:43:24] <dblosevn> youd need $('form') or add an id to the form hence id="sort" then you could do $('$sort').submit
[15:43:35] <dblosevn> rhizmoe: yes lol
[15:44:01] <dblosevn> jquery supports all css selectors plus some that jquery added as well
[15:44:12] <enderx86> oh, i can't just select it based on name? input type="submit" name="sort"
[15:44:28] <dblosevn> button doesnt have a submit method
[15:44:32] <dblosevn> form does
[15:44:35] <enderx86> oh
[15:44:42] <enderx86> okay
[15:44:45] <dblosevn> youd bind click on the button submit on the form
[15:44:50] <enderx86> then i have another problem: i have two submit buttons in one form
[15:44:55] <enderx86> one submit button generates a random list in the text area
[15:44:58] <enderx86> the other sends the list to the web service
[15:45:13] <dblosevn> although being its a submit button youd just bind submit on the form and it would cover enter key press and click
[15:45:13] <enderx86> how can i respond separately to both submit functions?
[15:45:25] <dblosevn> ok
[15:45:33] <dblosevn> in that case you dont want to use submit
[15:47:11] <enderx86> what should i use instead?
[15:47:45] <dblosevn> you could enderx86: http://pastebin.com/MEpL5ig3
[15:48:35] <enderx86> thanks!
[15:48:39] <dblosevn> that way the submit button still submit
[15:48:40] <dblosevn> s
[15:48:49] <dblosevn> and the other button fires the ajax call
[15:48:51] <enderx86> so submit is a form function, and click is an input type=button function
[15:49:10] <dblosevn> yes well in this case yes
[15:49:29] <dblosevn> i changed the other button to a button so it wouldnt fire a submit
[15:49:47] <dblosevn> e.preventDefault() would have stopped that too
[15:50:00] <enderx86> i see
[15:50:03] <enderx86> thanks for your time
[15:50:07] <dblosevn> np
[16:01:39] <brend_> got a doubt
[16:02:08] <dblosevn> turn it inside out
[16:02:10] <enderx86> best-practice question here. if i'm going to have one or more helper functions in my javascript, should i put all my code inside the anonymous function passed to my initial document-ready call? or should i pass a start function to document-ready that way i escape the braces so to speak?
[16:02:56] <dblosevn> maybe im tired, but i didnt get that
[16:03:44] <dblosevn> oh, if im neevr going to use it again i generally put it all in my onready
[16:03:59] <dblosevn> no need for it to take up memory if it will never be used again
[16:05:11] <brend_> lets say i have a form like this.. is it possible to input the data from the div to the server http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[16:05:42] <dblosevn> brend_: that made no sense
[16:06:15] <brend_> which part
[16:07:11] <dblosevn> are you saying you want to imediately submit the value on select?
[16:07:22] <enderx86> dblosevn: so is it okay to have $(function() { var f = function() {...} }); ?
[16:07:48] <enderx86> i.e. to define functions inside of the anonymous function passed to onready
[16:07:51] <dblosevn> enderx86: ya f only persists until onready completes
[16:08:03] <enderx86> i see, that way you take up less memory
[16:08:07] <enderx86> correct?
[16:08:17] <dblosevn> and keep the namespace clear at the same time
[16:08:27] <brend_> dblosevn:  yes sir
[16:09:11] <enderx86> dblosevn: i'm still a bit confused. if my onready code is called when a form is submitted, doesn't the code/functions persist until the submit event?
[16:09:41] <dblosevn> brend_: select: function( event, ui ) { $.post('/your-ajax-service', {selected: ui.item.id}, function (ret) { yourcallback code })}
[16:10:37] <dblosevn> well yes if there are listeners definied in the onready it will still persist in memory, however they still wont clutter the namespace
[16:10:52] <enderx86> i see
[16:11:22] <dblosevn> in other words you wont end up with a window.f
[16:11:42] <dblosevn> f will be scoped to the onready
[16:12:34] <enderx86> and if i have $(document).ready(function() { [...] var f = function() {...} }); then f will persist in the case of a submit event?
[16:12:54] <anew> stupid question but in jq .hide() ... while the page is loading it always shows what it is supposed to be hiding - any way to hide it from even being shown on page load ?
[16:12:56] <enderx86> i.e. if i have a listener inside the onready function, it will be able to use a helper function inside the onready function, when the event comes
[16:17:23] <dblosevn> enderx86: yes
[16:17:50] <dblosevn> anew: hide it with css show it with jquery
[16:18:31] <dblosevn> anew: either style="display: none;" or add a class to it
[16:22:14] <brend_> dblosevn:  is this fine? http://jsfiddle.net/anuka/
[16:23:21] <dblosevn> ya but not sure why you put an extra code block in there
[16:23:49] <dblosevn> brend_: http://jsfiddle.net/anuka/1/
[16:24:32] <anew> tthanks dblosevn i'm such a noob
[16:24:50] <dblosevn> anew: no problem we all were at some point
[16:25:43] <brend_> idk if im blind but im seeing the same
[16:26:19] <dblosevn> your blind
[16:26:48] <dblosevn> you had {{$.post('/employees.php', {selected: ui.item.id}, function (ret) { alert(ret); })}}
[16:27:17] <brend_> ow
[16:27:17] <dblosevn> still works but no reason for the extra code block
[16:27:18] <brend_> yes
[16:27:20] <brend_> i get it
[16:27:46] <brend_> the whisky is getting me blind
[16:31:47] <brend_> anyways this should be working better if i .prependTo an input text
[16:32:03] <dblosevn> um
[16:32:12] <dblosevn> not so much
[16:32:31] <brend_> i mean if i want to stores the values in the div
[16:32:38] <brend_> store*
[16:32:46] <dblosevn> prependTo expects an html element
[16:32:54] <dblosevn> well do that to
[16:33:29] <dblosevn> you said you wanted to send the data to the server on select i gave you the code to do that
[16:33:40] <brend_> i would use a table instead a div
[16:33:59] <dblosevn> the code i gave you wont put it in anything just send it to the server
[16:34:12] <brend_> dblosevn:  yes i know
[16:34:26] <dblosevn> anyways now im starving so next lol
[16:42:41] <enderx86> does input type="text" have a value function?
[16:43:18] <enderx86> $('#mytextarea').value() works but not $('#myinput').value()       :-/
[16:45:19] <wroathe> enderx86: .val()
[16:45:34] <enderx86> what?!
[16:45:56] <enderx86> textarea has value() but input has val()?
[16:46:00] <enderx86> why the inconsistency :-(
[16:46:00] <dblosevn> enderx86: $().value isnt even a function i dont think
[16:46:19] <dblosevn> i thought it was always .val
[16:46:21] <enderx86> oh
[16:46:37] <dblosevn> ?.value
[16:46:42] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[16:46:43] <enderx86> i see. i had $('textarea').value() but i never tested it - it probably would have generated an error
[16:47:31] <dblosevn> you would have got element has no method value had you tried that
[16:48:02] <dblosevn> .get(0).value would work though
[16:52:41] <digs> http://jsfiddle.net/zxfhp/1/ - I am trying to figure out how to replace or fix that while loop. Basically, I have a bunch of UI dialogs that are automatically created. The $("div."+idname).parent().nextAll('.ui-dialog').find('textarea').val(valueToCopy); line works great. However, I am not sure how to do this for the AJAX call.
[16:53:12] <brend_> hate roached
[16:53:15] <brend_> roaches
[16:53:25] <begriffs> I'm having what I think might be a timing problem with jquery. I am loading it dynamically into a page by creating a script element. In the onload callback, I attempt to use jquery like so $('BODY, BODY *').each(function () { … });
[16:53:37] * begriffs However I get an error in Chrome:
[16:53:45] <begriffs> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLBodyElement> has no method 'each'
[16:53:45] <begriffs> onScriptsLoaded
[16:53:47] <begriffs> k jquery.min.js:2
[16:53:48] <begriffs> l.fireWith jquery.min.js:2
[16:53:49] <begriffs> y jquery.min.js:2
[16:53:50] <begriffs> c.onload.c.onreadystatechange jquery.min.js:2
[16:54:16] <begriffs> When I run the script a second time on the same page it works. Is jquery not fully initialized?
[16:55:29] <dblosevn> begriffs: dont flood the channel
[16:55:42] <dblosevn> begriffs: are you trying to load jquery async?
[16:55:47] <dblosevn> if so that wont work
[16:56:26] <dblosevn> the second time it works because it pulls it from cache
[16:56:58] <begriffs> dblosevn: is there a workaround for loading async? Like try loading it async twice every time, so the second time will hit the cache?
[16:57:33] <dblosevn> the only way that will work is if your loader has a callback for all scripts loaded and use that instead of dom ready
[16:57:46] <dblosevn> domready will fire long before your async scripts are loaded
[16:58:42] <dblosevn> this is evidenced in the log you pasted
[16:58:53] <dblosevn> jquery was loaded `after` the exception
[16:59:35] <dblosevn> that onScriptsLoaded is probally the best place for your domready code
[16:59:49] <dblosevn> and id still wrap it in a domready incase the dom isnt ready yet
[17:00:20] <dblosevn> because theoretically the loader could fire onScriptsLoaded before domready if it pulled everything from cache
[17:01:14] <digs> That while loop I have works, it just hangs. I think the only thing that is wrong is my condition.
[17:01:20] <digs> while($("div.dialog-form"+(startingPoint+1).toString()))
[17:01:36] <digs> I just want to see if that class exists, if not, bail.
[17:01:49] <begriffs> dblosevn: can you take a look at my code? The loading stuff happens at the very end of this file: https://github.com/begriffs/css-ratiocinator/blob/master/css.js
[17:01:50] <digs> There was a ! in there.
[17:02:02] <digs> err no, there wasn't.
[17:03:35] <dblosevn> begriffs: id put it in  function onScriptsLoaded() {
[17:03:37] <lyda> i've got $(this).bind('keyup change' ...) working fine on a textarea.
[17:04:20] <lyda> it does a getjson on a url, but it's doing it for every keystroke.
[17:05:02] <lyda> is there a way to get it to be less eager - maybe run every 10 keystrokes or every 10 seconds?
[17:05:57] <begriffs> dblosevn: the script is meant to be pasted into the Chrome js console, so it's never actually part of a page. Maybe this is incompatible with using jquery.
[17:06:11] <dblosevn> or do this @begriffs http://pastebin.com/nWZnTt9h
[17:07:09] <hugo_moss> can someone tell me the proper way to make two ajax getjson requests and a callback function follow a proper order by using promises and deffered objects?
[17:09:00] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: honestly id do something like $.get('/firsturl', {params}, function(ret) { $.get('/secondurl', {params}, function(ret) { }); });
[17:09:34] <dblosevn> far less confusiong the promosies and deffereds
[17:11:04] <dblosevn> and i cant type for crap today im totally done lol
[17:11:25] <brend_> hey ho lets go
[17:11:56] <hugo_moss> dblo, isnt get just shorthand for $.ajax?
[17:12:09] <hugo_moss> the ajax request is still asynchronous isnt it?
[17:12:13] <dblosevn> ya, but i nested the second get
[17:12:24] <dblosevn> i didnt feel lke typing out the $.ajax code
[17:12:39] <dblosevn> yes the calls are async
[17:12:48] <hugo_moss> they are non-blocking methods, i need to have them in a particular order
[17:12:52] <dblosevn> also yes the calls will execute in the order i tell them too
[17:13:09] <dblosevn> as call 2 doesnt run until call1 completes
[17:13:31] <dblosevn> then youd do your real callback on call2 response
[17:13:59] <hugo_moss> hmm i tried that
[17:14:06] <hugo_moss> and it didnt work for some reason
[17:15:07] <dblosevn> hugo_moss: http://pastebin.com/xSs4R1R4
[17:15:30] <hugo_moss> wait
[17:15:35] <hugo_moss> if i do a get inside another get
[17:15:41] <hugo_moss> the inner get will execute
[17:15:44] <hugo_moss> but it wont block
[17:16:02] <hugo_moss> so code after it might run before the second ajax is finished
[17:16:03] <dblosevn> none of it will block its ajax
[17:16:07] <dblosevn> no
[17:16:21] <dblosevn> the callback wont fire until both have completed see paste
[17:16:58] <brend_> well im done for today.. got to go out and see some (  .  Y  .  )
[17:17:02] <hugo_moss> right
[17:17:04] <hugo_moss> the callback
[17:17:04] <brend_> se ya dblosevn
[17:17:10] <hugo_moss> but what if you put code after the callback
[17:17:24] <dblosevn> then oviously it will run prematurely
[17:17:24] <hugo_moss> after the get
[17:17:41] <dblosevn> put all code that cant run before the callback in the callback
[17:19:32] <dblosevn> if you use my code exactly how it is only updating the urls and params, youd put all the code in function callback(ret1,ret2) that will have both responses in it when its fired
[17:21:01] <dblosevn> see ya brend_ :-)
[17:24:03] <dblosevn> or you could eliminate the callback function and do evertyhing in the callback of call 2 i just did it like that so you could clearly see what was happening
[17:50:22] <redgetan> what lib do u guys recommend for inplace edit?
[17:50:35] <redgetan> jeditable looks good, im currently leaning towards it
[17:59:59] <dblosevn> ive used jeditable in the past
[18:00:45] <dblosevn> redgetan: worked like a charm
[18:10:04] <RonWhoCares> is there a way for JQuery to check in a 'Checkbox' when a SELECT option has been accessed?
[18:12:05] <RonWhoCares> what I am trying to do is have a checkbox indicate which records have been updated
[18:12:12] <RonWhoCares> by the users
[18:44:13] <hugo_moss> dbloseven: you there?
[18:46:11] <hugo_moss> well your idea worked, kind of. i have a live method inside a jcarousel itemLoadCallback function, and i have inside that callback function, the nested ajax calls, with the final call back function in the innermost ajax function.  i have alerts setup, and for some reason, the innermost callback function gets run more than once? i dont know why.
[18:47:18] <hugo_moss> its actually looping like 10 times
[18:48:09] <hugo_moss> oh shit
[18:48:11] <hugo_moss> i think i got it
[18:55:11] <hugo_moss> nope
[19:00:03] <RonWhoCares> hi hugo_moss
[19:00:03] <acidjazz> so im trying to do page transitions w/ opacity: 1 and .show() and .hide()
[19:00:19] <acidjazz> i got css3 transitions assigned to these classes to animate them
[19:00:26] <acidjazz> but .show() and .hide() isnt delaying to show the animation
[19:00:45] <acidjazz> like $(element).addclass('fadeOut').hide();
[19:01:03] <acidjazz> do i really have to get ghetto and setTimeout(function() { $(element.hide(); }, 500); ?
[19:04:17] <AndiM> hey guys, anyone here use Drupal and Jquery?
[19:05:32] * nightfly_ would imagine so
[19:06:29] <AndiM> In that case, has anyone had any experience simulating a click of the "add another item" button on a node edit's node reference field using jquery, if so, how :) ?
[19:06:42] <RonWhoCares> Does anyone know how to use JQuery to change a checkbox when a select is changed?
[19:10:24] <acidjazz> a select is changed?
[19:10:45] <acidjazz> you try .attr('selected', true); ?
[19:11:19] <RonWhoCares> I want it so when a select is changed the checkbox for that row is checked
[19:32:40] <hugo_moss> this is a bitch
[19:42:33] <hugo_moss> i have a question, why would you want to send data back to the server? like in get( url, { something: "something" } )
[19:47:31] <tw2113> to do something with it
[19:47:44] <tw2113> that can't be done on the client side
[21:26:50] <ezyang> How well does jQuery interoperate with other libraries which make addEventListener calls? Are there known gotchas?
[22:38:17] <someprimetime> ? noconflict @ ezyang
[22:38:17] <bot-t> ezyang, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[22:38:48] <ezyang> Hm, not quite
[22:39:06] <ezyang> Actually, I've already figured it out: has to do with trigger() only hitting jQuery handlers and not "real" handlers
[23:01:17] <giusy> ciao
[23:01:21] <giusy> !list
