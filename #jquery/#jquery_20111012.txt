[00:00:53] <solidus-river> would $('this').id return the id as a string?
[00:00:59] <solidus-river> i wisht erhe were an interactive console i could try this out in
[00:01:54] <Spadeski> solidus-river:  Yes it does cause it may be any characters in the id tag
[00:02:04] <Spadeski> Not just numbers
[00:02:26] <mooKoo> question: I have a <select id="A"><option value="X">Y</option></select>. Now, with $("#A").val(); I get the X, as expected, but what if I want the Y instead?
[00:03:05] <solidus-river> Spadeski: thats what i want but it doesnt seem to be working
[00:03:16] <Spadeski> solidus-river:  show me
[00:03:37] <solidus-river> http://www.pastie.org/2681428
[00:03:48] <solidus-river> thats from the debug console, so after the command it gives the output
[00:04:15] <Spadeski> mooKooL try $("#A #X").val()
[00:04:38] <z51> try $("#A").text()
[00:05:01] <z51> returns all text inside #A
[00:05:12] <z51> 'Y' in this case
[00:05:40] <Spadeski> Yeah nice
[00:05:46] <solidus-river> Spadeski: nevermind it was in an object i needed to get it out first
[00:05:59] <Spadeski> solidus-river:  No problem :p
[00:06:33] <mooKoo> z51: but there is not just that one option
[00:07:12] <mooKoo> erm well, yeah...
[00:07:18] <Spadeski> z51 Any experience with Draggables ?
[00:07:25] <mooKoo> select the selected ;) ...
[00:07:44] <RobertoBlanco> got a question... I am using Fancybox to have an iframe URL in a Pop-Up. Now i have to add "?image=xyz" to the URL, but the Fancybbox will not work anylonger with a "?" in the URL - any Ideas?
[00:09:10] <mooKoo> z51: $("#A option:selected").text(); is the thing :) thx for getting me there :)
[00:09:40] <z51> ^^
[00:09:56] <z51> Spadeski, nope
[00:09:57] <solidus-river> is the $(this) object also wrapped in a jquery object? what about this.elem
[00:14:18] <solidus-river> hmm $(this).id this.id this.elem.id $(this)[0].id
[00:14:19] <solidus-river> all fail
[00:14:42] <z51> $(this).attr('id')
[00:14:45] <z51> ?
[00:19:08] <Trisox> waiting for ios5 to release..
[00:21:37] <smurfke> why
[00:21:47] <smurfke> any advancements to jquery?
[00:22:05] <smurfke> safari gets updated probably
[00:34:14] <danieliser> ie7 height auto.. when i use slideDown() the object slides down to the bottom of the screen then snaps back to the correct size.. works fine in all others
[00:34:26] <danieliser> ideas?
[00:49:04] <nospinzy> where can i find a basic ajax table for a database

[01:29:39] <asi> hi. I need to extract 'section-lead-management' form this string "view view-feature-tour view-id-feature_tour view-display-id-attachment_3 section-lead-management" how can i do it
[01:29:42] <ProLoser|Work> i'm nodding off
[01:30:38] <NodeX> var a = str.split(" "); var myVar=a[(a.length-1)];
[01:31:04] <ProLoser|Work> if i call $.when() multiple times, on the same request/function, does it cache the results after the first call and then just immediately fire subsequent calls?
[01:31:05] <NodeX> str being your string @ asi
[01:31:30] <ProLoser|Work> or does it start the whole query process all over again, only queueing up requests per call of when?
[01:32:23] <ProLoser|Work> like if i do $.when(foo()); $.when(foo()); does the second $.when() fire off the entire foo() request all over again?
[01:33:10] <NodeX> i've never used it ... best to do a quick test and see
[01:33:53] <WalterTamboer> Hello everybody
[01:34:06] <Thomas_> anyone had the problem of a jquery datepicker not showing properly?
[01:34:14] <Thomas_> it should pop up at input focus
[01:34:22] <Thomas_> it's there, it has the calendar in it (in the source code), but it's like it's hidden behind everything
[01:34:29] <Thomas_> increasing the z-index doesn't solve the problem
[01:34:34] <Thomas_> had this problem before but can't remember the solution ..
[01:34:55] <WalterTamboer> Quick question: When is one supposed to create a jQuery plugin and when should one create a new widget? What is the fundamental difference?
[01:37:39] <asi> NodeX: perfect! Thanks
[01:41:09] <ProLoser|Work> how can i prevent items that have already been executed from being executed more than once? http://jsfiddle.net/a4GVA/
[01:49:46] <newn> Hi there
[01:51:54] <aaronmcadam> mornin doods
[01:52:45] <newn> Does anyone know how i can get the value of a .find command used on a xml object
[01:53:01] <newn> $(this).text doesnt work
[01:54:26] <quicksilver> "the value of a .find command"
[01:54:29] <quicksilver> I'm not even sure what you mean.
[01:54:40] <newn> ok
[01:54:54] <aaronmcadam> think he means the returned set
[01:55:05] <newn> i used a webservice by using the soap message
[01:55:12] <aaronmcadam> eesh
[01:55:36] <NodeX> I thought soap was what people washed with
[01:55:36] <quicksilver> .text() works on XML but it only returns the text parts AFAIK
[01:55:41] <aaronmcadam> have u got the xml?
[01:55:46] <newn> lol
[01:55:53] <newn> yes ive got it
[01:55:56] <aaronmcadam> cool
[01:55:57] <z51> xml.find('text').text()
[01:55:59] <aaronmcadam> what do u want to do
[01:56:18] <z51> xml <text>123</text> returns 123
[01:57:09] <z51> a = $('<xml1><xml2>123</xml2></xml1>').find('xml2').text()
[01:57:09] <z51> "123"
[01:58:01] <newn> this is my response $(xmlHttpRequest.responsetext)
[01:58:27] <aaronmcadam> ha yeah
[01:58:55] <Thomas_> anyone had the problem of a jquery datepicker not showing properly?
[01:58:59] <newn> an then i used after this i used the .find('xzy')

[02:09:51] <rahmen> Hi! I'm adding a loading icon to my page. Under it it says "Downloading..." during the time I download. Then I want to edit the text to "Parsing..." or whatever. But the parsing is done in a function in the script (not ajax) so the first problem is that the text never changes although I have that row before the function call. And problem two is that the loading gif freezes since it's busy...
[02:09:53] <rahmen> ...parsing. And when the parsing is done the loading icon dissapears as it should. So I want to tell the script to focus on changing the text to "Parsing..." before making the function call or maybe I can tell it to create a new thread to make the loading status updates? How am I supposed to handle this? Thanks in advance!
[02:10:42] <blazento> hi im using jquery ui sortable. i'm still trying to make sense of the serialized data that it's giving me on update. Does this look right? {"sort"=>"menu[]=1&menu[]=2&menu[]=4&menu[]=3"}
[02:11:31] <NodeX> anyone use delegate() much ?
[02:24:59] <alaing> NodeX: I do
[02:25:26] <NodeX> when I have to listen to all classes without passing it a context why is it better than live
[02:25:46] <NodeX> i.e $(document.body).delegate('.class','click'.....
[02:26:20] <NodeX> from what I can tell that does the same as live() with the same amount of resources .. I'm working out why I should switch
[02:30:18] <alaing> with live the events  travels up to body where the listener is places
[02:30:37] <alaing> delegate allows you to place the listerner closer to the source
[02:30:39] <NodeX> yer but so it does in delegate
[02:30:48] <NodeX> when I use document.body
[02:31:00] <alaing> dont use body
[02:31:06] <NodeX> no choice
[02:31:23] <alaing> so you completely replace/remove your page content?
[02:31:32] <NodeX> $("a").delegate(".classname",'click'... doersnt work
[02:31:37] <NodeX> doesn't*
[02:32:22] <NodeX> however if I use an #id in a wrapper it works fine ... what I am trying to work out is if delegate behaves the same as live when the selector is wide
[02:33:06] <NodeX> I find it more efficient in this current project where many things in different places with the same classname have to be listened to and they are in different contexts
[02:33:36] <alaing> no you not using it correctly
[02:33:50] <NodeX> rather than multiple delegate() listners it's more efficient (in my instance) to use live as it cuts listners down by 10 times
[02:34:06] <alaing> so you want to "listen for .classname?
[02:34:10] <NodeX> yer
[02:34:35] <alaing> what is the parent element for .classname is it the body?
[02:34:38] <NodeX> but what I assumed would work $("a").delegate('.class'... didnt work
[02:34:43] <NodeX> it will be yes
[02:35:26] <alaing> $('a') wouldn't work
[02:36:14] <alaing> hmmm
[02:36:24] <NodeX> I understand that $(document.body).delegate('.class' is the way
[02:36:25] <NodeX> but how is that different from using live() with a context ---> $(".class","body").live('click'...
[02:36:49] <NodeX> I dont see how one is more efficient than the other seeing as delegate just wraps live with more context
[02:36:49] <alaing> see normally you would be adding/removing/replacing content on part of your page not you whole pag
[02:37:07] <NodeX> the3 page is weird
[02:37:36] <alaing> I dont think in your case it would be any more efficient
[02:37:43] <NodeX> for example to send a message to a user you click on <a class="message-user" ... but that is in multple places around the page so there is no context
[02:38:04] <NodeX> I didn't think it would be - just thought I would check with someone who has experience
[02:38:14] <NodeX> ** experience with delegate
[02:38:23] <alaing> example  in my cms it uses table-based layouts whcih have tables within tables. now when i used live it would take around 5 secs to fire say a click event
[02:38:32] <NodeX> ouch
[02:38:39] <NodeX> I never traverse that deep
[02:38:50] <NodeX> and my live is allways in a loose sense anyway
[02:39:23] <NodeX> now I also have some ammo for all the live() haters lmfao
[02:39:36] <alaing> but when I used delegate and placed it in the parent element it fired in less than 1 sec
[02:40:02] <NodeX> yer .. live() is the same if you pass a context
[02:40:10] <NodeX> as that's all delegate does lol#
[02:40:21] <NodeX> it turns live
[02:40:49] <NodeX> $('.selector').live() into $('selector','#parent'..
[02:41:34] <NodeX> anyway ty for the brainstorm
[02:41:53] <StHa> Hello. I wish to use the onerror event handler. How can I use this? I am using version 1.4.2 and need it for the general window.onerror equivalent
[02:42:09] <rahmen> Was I not clear with my question or is this not a common thing? A loading image that is threaded or somehow prioritized so it does not freeze?
[02:42:45] <NodeX> rahmen : please repeat
[02:42:56] <NodeX> StHa : you will need to be a bit more verbose
[02:43:39] <rahmen> NodeX: I pastebinned it since it was a long question: http://pastebin.com/ME0HafG6
[02:43:58] <NodeX> sorry I had to restart my IRC - I didn't see it :)
[02:44:35] <NodeX> rahmen look at $.when
[02:44:38] <NodeX> ?when
[02:44:39] <bot-t> NodeX, jQuery.when() - Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[02:44:42] <nospinzy> anyone have a good tutorial on how to do a simple datagrid
[02:45:08] <nospinzy> can someone help me gather info realy quick on what i need to be looking for
[02:45:12] <alaing> NodeX: I remember there was a yayquery podcast which discussed delegate vs live
[02:45:21] <nospinzy> i want it to function like this http://coupondivas.com/coupon-database.html
[02:45:30] <nospinzy> i just dont know where to start
[02:46:00] <NodeX> I read a few casts but no-1 really knew why one was better than the other .. so I looked at the source and it just wraps live with more context
[02:46:25] <NodeX> nospinzy : tablesorter
[02:46:42] <NodeX> http://tablesorter.com/docs/
[02:47:02] <NodeX> $i<=10;$i__
[02:47:10] <NodeX> oops
[02:47:16] <nospinzy> ok i guess i can start with that
[02:47:23] <alaing> NodeX: http://vimeo.com/9767602 fastward to 04:50
[02:47:29] <rahmen> NodeX: Is this the way to do it? $.when(function() { *update loading text* }).done(*start parsing*); <-- This would be good enough for me but it would still make my gif freeze right?
[02:47:42] <nospinzy> the only thing is that it dosnt have an option to go to more data
[02:49:00] <StHa> I have a problem in which I cannot use the window.onerror because it is probably being used already. and now I'd like to call the onerror event handler
[02:51:16] <StHa> But I read it wasn't working properly within 1.4.2
[02:51:43] <NodeX> rahmen : I have never used it but it's what you need
[03:10:39] <fpauser_> how to address the last created tab?
[03:11:00] <dogarrhea2> hrm ui.draggable stops having $.data. why does it do this
[03:12:17] <dogarrhea2> seems like the draggable item you put $.data on should still have that data.. why does it not have that data anymore in the droppable drop: method? bug? limitation?
[03:15:34] <fpauser_> [jquery-ui-1.8.6] How to add data to a dynamically created tab?
[03:21:54] <dogarrhea2> hmm i'll ask later int he morning
[03:21:55] <dogarrhea2> but seems like a huge bug
[03:34:28] <negev> hi, what could cause javascript to stop executing after dropping content into a div?  im doing an ajax call using jquery, then doing $('#content').html(data);   and then if i put alert('test'); on the very next line i get nothing
[03:34:51] <dogarrhea2> why does no one care about documentation bugs
[03:35:14] <NodeX> dogarrhea2 ?
[03:35:26] <NodeX> ?p @ negev
[03:35:27] <bot-t> negev, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:38:34] <negev> i just said what the code was :/
[03:39:56] <NodeX> :)
[03:47:34] <dogarrhea2> what the heck is a ui.helper
[03:49:25] <dogarrhea2> well. looks like draggable/droppable data is out of the question with the broken way that jquery ui does things
[03:50:26] <NodeX> then don't use it
[03:51:06] <NodeX> or perhaps pastebin your code and we can help
[03:52:25] <dogarrhea2> nodex, do you know why ui.draggable is cast to some object that throws away $.data()?
[03:52:49] <NodeX> it sets it's own data on the object iirc
[03:52:58] <dogarrhea2> so it's basically broken
[03:53:05] <NodeX> which would remove any data already there
[03:53:15] <NodeX> no - it's expected behaviour
[03:53:18] <dogarrhea2> one would think ui.draggable is actually the original draggable object with data..
[03:53:40] <dogarrhea2> expected from developers who didn't want to code an extra very intuitive use case?
[03:53:41] <NodeX> it does when I've used it int he past
[03:53:50] <dogarrhea2> when did it change?
[03:53:52] <NodeX> I can make something draggable and add / remove with data() on it
[03:54:47] <NodeX> pastebin your code
[03:55:03] <dogarrhea2> k this is gonna take a bit of time
[03:55:15] <NodeX> just the bit that';s trying to get/set data() will be fine
[04:00:08] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/PkDQQ/2/ i just put down the logic in mind.. hard to debug on jsfiddle
[04:00:39] <dogarrhea2> and you can't really drag things around in jsfiddle
[04:01:34] <poisttu> hi is there a way of converting a link <a href> to an object similar to $(location), where i could separate hash, search and base of the link?
[04:01:43] <NodeX> try using the other method of data
[04:02:30] <NodeX> this.parentDiv.data("objectify"{"someString":"theSlider"});
[04:02:44] <NodeX> that is what ui uses and this way it "extends" rather than overwrites
[04:02:55] <NodeX> sorry
[04:03:21] <NodeX> infact no it's right lol the "this" threw me
[04:03:58] <NodeX> this.parentDiv.data("objectify",{"someString":"theSlider"}); <--- typo
[04:05:36] <dogarrhea2> so basically all of http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/ should be eliminated from the internet
[04:05:50] <NodeX> it's a different method
[04:06:20] <dogarrhea2> that doesn't work from what i'm hearing
[04:06:39] <NodeX> it works for me
[04:08:42] <dogarrhea2> ugh
[04:08:53] <dogarrhea2> i don't know what to do anymore
[04:08:59] <dogarrhea2> ui.draggable should just have the data..
[04:09:07] <NodeX> it does
[04:09:09] <dogarrhea2> i'm not even removing anything
[04:09:10] <NodeX> it extends it
[04:09:23] <NodeX> when you add your data like that you are rmeoving it not UI
[04:09:27] <NodeX> removing*
[04:09:43] <raccoon_> poisttu: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/urlParser
[04:10:05] <dogarrhea2> i don't get it
[04:10:16] <dogarrhea2> how is using that way wrong? it's in the docs
[04:10:26] <NodeX> it's the wrong method
[04:10:41] <dogarrhea2> so the docs are wrong.
[04:10:46] <NodeX> no
[04:10:50] <NodeX> you are using the wrong method
[04:10:53] <dogarrhea2> i tried the other way too btw. $data(...) not defined or some other error
[04:11:19] <NodeX> that's not a helpful error and it's probably due to the way you are calling it
[04:11:39] <NodeX> Prior to jQuery 1.4.3 (starting in jQuery 1.4) the .data() method completely replaced all data, instead of just extending the data object. If you are using third-party plugins it may not be advisable to completely replace the element's data object, since plugins may have also set data.
[04:12:00] <dogarrhea2> jQuery.data(document.body, 'bar', 'test'); <---- this is in the docs
[04:12:03] <dogarrhea2> so that is incorrect?
[04:12:14] <NodeX> IT;'s the WRONG method for the 5th time
[04:12:19] <quuxman> I've got an interesting problem: I have a bunch of elements with id attributes that are used in many places (css files, other js files, etc). I want to be able to duplicate these in the DOM, while maintaining their CSS behavior from their id attribute
[04:12:21] <dogarrhea2> so the docs are wrong.
[04:12:28] <dogarrhea2> please point me to the correct method
[04:12:33] <dogarrhea2> i'm just going by the docs for the last time
[04:12:36] <NodeX> I already have
[04:12:43] <quuxman> but without having duplicate ids, which causes undefined weird behavior
[04:13:00] <NodeX> $(selector).data("object",{"key":"value"});
[04:13:20] <Cork> ?.data
[04:13:20] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[04:13:27] <quuxman> is there some way I can clone an elements CSS, along with its inherited styles?
[04:13:31] <NodeX> or from my previous time that I showed you how ... this.parentDiv.data("object",{"key":"value"});
[04:13:46] <Cork> you can stor anything in data , there is no limit to its structure
[04:13:53] <NodeX> if you are using jquery <1.4.3 it will get overwritten no matter what
[04:14:16] <NodeX> COrk : one extends one doesn't .. he is using the one that overwrites
[04:14:30] <Cork> ah
[04:14:37] <poisttu> raccoon_: yes, perfect thanks
[04:15:27] <quicksilver> it was only ever the .data({...}) form that overwrite, as far as I am aware
[04:15:38] <quicksilver> the .data(key,value) was always safe
[04:15:46] <NodeX> noipe
[04:15:52] <seutje> sometimes I wonder if ppl intentionally destroy indentation and readability stuff from their code when pasting it to jsfiddle
[04:16:05] <NodeX> the same thing screwed with my head about 2 years ago
[04:16:28] <quicksilver> anyway it doesn't matter unless someone is using jQ 1.4.0 ... 1.4.3
[04:16:34] <quicksilver> which they shouldn't be :)
[04:16:37] <NodeX> yer ..
[04:17:06] <quicksilver> also, jQuery.data(elt,key,value) should work just as well as $(elt).data(key,value)
[04:17:12] <quicksilver> although I always prefer the way the latter looks
[04:17:31] <NodeX> jQuery.data(elt,key,value) <-- overwrites
[04:17:33] <blazento> i've been building a custom slideshow and i would like to take this progress bar idea from this website: http://palantir.com/... they have three squares on the lower-right corner where, the box is empty upon starting a new slide and when the box fills up, the slide changes. what do you recommend to impliment this? I thought of using jquery's built-in progress-bar but so far no luck
[04:18:00] <NodeX> mebbe it's fixed in 1.6.4 but it certainly used to and since then I have not bothered wiht it in favour of the other way
[04:18:48] <dogarrhea2> ok. thanks for sorting me out Nodex
[04:18:58] <dogarrhea2> "The jQuery.data() method allows us to attach data of any type to DOM elements in a way that is safe from circular references and therefore free from memory leaks" <----- this is EXTREMELY misleading
[04:19:06] <dogarrhea2> using the word "attach" instead of "overwrite"
[04:19:35] <NodeX> I suppose it kinda is misleading
[04:19:53] <NodeX> and it did me in too when I started with it
[04:24:38] <quicksilver> NodeX: jQuery.data(elt,key,value) does not overwrite
[04:25:03] <quicksilver> NodeX: in jQuery versions: 1.2.6,1.3.2,1.4.4,1.5.2 or 1.6.2
[04:25:06] <quicksilver> tested in jsfiddle.
[04:25:25] <quicksilver>     console.log('foo = ' + $.data(elt,'foo') + ' bar = ' + $.data(elt,'bar'));
[04:25:29] <quicksilver> http://jsfiddle.net/u4NAr/
[04:25:51] <quicksilver> dogarrhea2: it doesn't overwrite.
[04:25:57] <quicksilver> unless you reuse the same key, of course.
[04:26:14] <NodeX> as I said it used to
[04:26:21] <NodeX> and I havn't bothered since then
[04:26:56] <quicksilver> it doesn't in any jquery version I had available to test
[04:27:03] <quicksilver> and I highly doubt it's responsible for dogarrhea2's problem
[04:27:10] <quicksilver> which, I suspect, is just caused by writing the wrong code
[04:27:30] <NodeX> It was a problem in a jquery of about 2 years back
[04:28:10] <NodeX> Unfortuncatley I can't remember the version and it's of no consequence anyway because it's int eh past :)
[04:29:28] <quicksilver> dogarrhea2: in conclusion, the docs aren't wrong, or particularly misleading, jquery data doesn't overwrite in general, and your problem must be something else.
[04:30:04] <dogarrhea2> well, the data disappeared
[04:30:15] <dogarrhea2> and the docs make no mention of this and used the word "attach"
[04:30:24] <dogarrhea2> which should never mean "things disappear"
[04:30:45] <dogarrhea2> i'm a very literate person (at least in English and Chinese).
[04:31:26] <quicksilver> dogarrhea2: yes. jquery data should not make data disappear.
[04:31:31] <quicksilver> and, it does not do that.
[04:31:41] <quicksilver> either you have found a bug in jQuery, or you are doing something else wrong.
[04:31:46] <quicksilver> to my mind the latter is more likely.
[04:31:55] <quicksilver> unless you show us your code it's going to be hard to be sure.
[04:32:02] <dogarrhea2> eh it's up there.
[04:32:11] <dogarrhea2> and it's using draggable so jsfiddle won't work too well
[04:32:23] <quicksilver> I saw one tiny jsfiddle which doesn't let me reproduce the problem.
[04:32:25] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/PkDQQ/2/
[04:32:43] <dogarrhea2> well it's done now. i'm using the 2 parameter vs 3 parameter data
[04:33:08] <dogarrhea2> i'm not going to upload images 15 mb worth of files
[04:33:13] <NodeX> heh
[04:35:21] <dogarrhea2> time to take a nap.
[04:36:54] <quuxman> so nobody has any thoughts on this duplicating element problem?
[04:37:37] <NodeX> clongin ingerited styles ?
[04:37:43] <NodeX> inherited *
[04:38:00] <quicksilver> NodeX: dogarrhea2's problem was that he was mixing $.data() and $(elt).data()
[04:38:09] <mydoghasworms> Is either the $.html() or tmpl() (from the official template plugin) methods asynchronous? How can one tell if a method is async?
[04:38:12] <quicksilver> NodeX: they are different data stores you can't set to one and read from the other.
[04:38:18] <NodeX> quicksilver : that's what I said it was lol
[04:38:20] <quuxman> NodeX: yeah, that's one possible solution I guess
[04:38:50] <NodeX> more specifically I said UI extends to use the $().data() method
[04:40:32] <quuxman> I want all the CSS that applies to an element to "stick to it" after I clone it and remove the id
[04:40:47] <NodeX> I highly dount you can do that quuxman
[04:40:51] <NodeX> doubt *
[04:41:21] <quicksilver> NodeX: nothing to do with UI though
[04:41:24] <NodeX> a plugin to search the DOM parents and get it's parent CSS yeh sure but what about browser inherited CSS .. default margins etc
[04:41:28] <quicksilver> NodeX: you can demonstrate this problem without UI
[04:41:33] <NodeX> quicksilver : w/e - it's done
[04:41:41] <NodeX> I really don't care lol
[04:42:07] <quuxman> I guess the only reasonable solution is to not use id attributes in css, though that means I have a bunch of css to change
[04:43:56] <quuxman> the underlying problem is that I want to manipulate various elements, and then have them return to their original state. The easiest way is to clone the original hidden element, manipulate it, then remove it
[04:43:59] <lata> A lot of tutorials says that you have to put jquery code in the <head> â€“ is this absolutely nessesary?
[04:44:40] <NodeX> quuxman : they should re-inherit if they are put back in place no ?
[04:44:50] <NodeX> lata : no
[04:44:52] <quuxman> lata: generally best to put it in the head before any other script files, because if you use jquery, everything ends up depending on it
[04:44:57] <NodeX> it's advisable for page speed to not
[04:45:32] <NodeX> page speed -> page speed score
[04:46:02] <quuxman> NodeX: no, the problem is when I clone the original element, and then insert it, I now have to elements with the same id, which doesn't work
[04:46:11] <quuxman> *two
[04:46:12] <lata> thx
[04:46:18] <NodeX> remember that downloads are blocking so while it's downloading scripts / css the page can't render
[04:46:43] <NodeX> modern browsers allow upto 8 parralell downloads (per host) so it's not a major problem
[04:47:03] <NodeX> but it will still inherit it's parent CSS quuxman
[04:47:30] <NodeX> if I add an LI to a UL that has no margin the LI still has no margin unless I specifically set it
[04:47:55] <NodeX> you can grab the whole CSS as an object iirc and re-apply it
[04:48:12] <quuxman> NodeX: ahah! I thought you were just saying you can't do this
[04:48:22] <NodeX> no you wanted inheritence from it's parent
[04:48:28] <NodeX> i.e fonts etc
[04:48:35] <NodeX> that's what I thought you meant lol
[04:48:47] <quuxman> NodeX: ah, I misused "inheritance"
[04:49:16] <quuxman> how do you copy the whole CSS object?
[04:49:27] <NodeX> 1 sec I jsfiddle it to test
[04:50:02] <quuxman> Actually, it's more complicated than that
[04:50:25] <quuxman> because the CSS matches child elements of what I want to clone
[04:50:40] <quuxman> like "#foo h2 { blah blah }"
[04:51:20] <NodeX> hmmz
[04:52:07] <quuxman> NodeX: indeed. This has been puzzling me for hours
[04:52:15] <NodeX> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/754607/can-jquery-get-all-css-styles-associated-with-an-element
[04:52:19] <NodeX> that will get the CSS for you
[04:52:30] <NodeX> not sure on the other atm
[04:52:33] <NodeX> lemme think about it
[04:56:06] <quuxman> Probably the best solution would be to just use the original element and not duplicate them
[04:56:20] <quuxman> But then I have to be very careful how I modify them
[04:57:46] <energee> i would like to use this hovrintentent script but would like both elements to be at the same hierarchy http://jsfiddle.net/WLjCv/24/
[04:58:30] <sanjeev_> how to get a div zoom with it's content too
[04:58:39] <energee> (because the function executes when hovering over the "show this" div as well
[04:58:44] <energee> )
[04:59:02] <quuxman> I'm realizing there's quite a bit of code depending on these id attributes
[04:59:11] <quuxman> FML

[05:01:27] <romankrv> Hi. What is best way for next case: I have two <select> and I chenge item in one select and other select must change own items (<option>)  How work with it?
[05:03:10] <quuxman> romankrv: hmm, that's a pretty commun UI pattern... First you need a data structure containing your option tree...
[05:04:28] <quuxman> romankrv: if you have just two <select>s, it could simply be an object / dictionary
[05:05:29] <quuxman> romankrv: where the keys are the values of the first select, and the values are lists of name/value pairs for populating the second select
[05:05:42] <sanjeev_> how to get a div zoom with it's content too
[05:06:34] <quuxman> sanjeev_: use the transform property
[05:06:42] <quuxman> sanjeev_: all browsers support a version of it
[05:06:52] <romankrv> quuxman: without js?
[05:07:13] <quuxman> sanjeev_: style='transform:scale(1.2)'
[05:07:42] <quuxman> romankrv: without JS? You're in the wrong channel
[05:08:29] <romankrv> no I want to use jquery for that
[05:08:47] <romankrv> exist some demo url for that?
[05:12:33] <ravenzz> Is there a way to have the same handler for 2 events?
[05:13:18] <quicksilver> ravenzz: $(blah).bind('mouseenter mouseleave',handler)

[05:15:16] <cambrian> Good morning! I have a SlickGrid (think spreadsheet) that is populated with default data on $(document).ready. The SlickGrid has a onCellChange method that will use an ajax call to save any changes you make to the data in the grid. I also have an area to apply filters and return a filtered dataset. It triggers on form submit, posts the filter requirements, returns the filtered data, then uses
[05:15:16] <cambrian> the jQuery .replaceWith to replace the old grid with a new grid object. This is done within the scope of the button.click event, so when the function ends, the grid.onCellChange method is not being triggered anymore. Code: https://gist.github.com/feb704a94034c22aa68f  How can I update the SlickGrid object without replacing it, or how can I make the slick.onCellChange method availible once the
[05:15:16] <cambrian> button.click function has been triggered?
[05:15:49] <energee> is there a better way to write this? http://jsfiddle.net/WLjCv/33/
[05:15:54] <quuxman> romankrv: oh, excuse me for not making that an I'm Feeling Lucky link
[05:17:34] <romankrv> quuxman: thx
[05:19:30] <ravenzz> quicksilver I am trying to do something like http://pastie.org/2682599
[05:20:32] <ravenzz> I could replace hover with mouseenter/leave and then bind('mouseenter focus') and bind('mouseleave blur')
[05:20:41] <ravenzz> Is that right?
[05:23:03] <WalterTamboer> Quick question: When is one supposed to create a jQuery plugin and when should one create a new widget? What is the fundamental difference? My guess is that a widget should be created for a UI control and a plugin for logical control. But why are there so many UI controls made as plugins than?
[05:23:08] <quuxman> ravenzz: are you still working on a hover intent thing?
[05:23:55] <quicksilver> ravenzz: erm I'm a bit confused
[05:24:21] <ravenzz> quicksilver I need to do the same stuffs on hover/focus
[05:24:48] <quicksilver> well hover isn't a true event it's a pseudo event as far as I know
[05:24:49] <ravenzz> focus = when you select the links with tab
[05:24:58] <quicksilver> what's wrong with just doing what you're doing now?
[05:25:03] <ravenzz> well let's say mouseover/leave
[05:25:32] <quicksilver> what are you trying to do different, though? what makes you unhappy about the way you're doing it now?
[05:25:51] <quicksilver> (hover uses mouseleave under the hood AFAIK)
[05:25:55] <ravenzz> actually I wrote that twice http://pastie.org/2682624
[05:26:11] <ravenzz> and that sucks
[05:26:29] <quuxman> ravenzz: because if you're wrestling with hover issues, I'd highly recommend Three Dub Media's hover plugin
[05:26:30] <ravenzz> quuxman uh?
[05:27:15] <quicksilver> ravenzz: so don't write it twice.
[05:27:20] <quicksilver> ravenzz: make it a function/give it a name
[05:29:23] <quicksilver> ravenzz: http://pastie.org/2682651
[05:29:40] <quicksilver> ravenzz: 'in' is illegal as a variable name and even if it wasn't it would be a bad choice :)
[05:29:44] <quicksilver> but you get the idea.
[05:31:00] <ravenzz> yep I have done the same thing
[05:31:00] <ravenzz> ty
[05:33:51] <cambrian> Anyone know how I can make an object and it's methods availible outside the scope of an event function (.click) that already triggered?
[05:35:07] <quuxman> just declare the variable outside the scope of the event handler, and assign to it inside of it
[05:35:37] <quuxman> and by "outside" I mean in a parent scope
[05:37:09] <cambrian> quuxman: OK, so I can declare it in document.ready ... inside document.ready I can have an event handler where I assign it an object, and when the event handler ends, the object and it's methods will remain?

[05:51:06] <cook1es> Is there anything I can do to make the animation of .slideToggle not begin from above the actual position?
[05:52:16] <soahccc> NodeX: http://pastebin.com/HwAu9NzE I switched from prototype, maybe I have an error in my logic
[05:53:23] <NodeX> which vars are bign overwritten
[05:53:28] <NodeX> being *
[05:54:23] <kswedberg> soahccc: to start, change $.extend(settings, options); to $.extend({}, settings, options);

[05:55:51] <jorisw> Hi plz. Can I catch a click on an iframe? Not the content of the iframe, just the iframe. i.e. catch a click on a Like button.
[05:56:21] <NodeX> if it's not a remote source yes
[05:56:33] <jorisw> The iframe is local, but the iframe source is remote.
[05:56:45] <NodeX> then no
[05:56:56] <Cork> jorisw: cross domain blocks all events except load
[05:57:21] <Cork> posibly unload, not sure there
[05:57:33] <jorisw> Cork: So a click event on the local iframe element is never fired?
[05:57:57] <Cork> exactly as your actually clicked in the dom of the other site
[05:58:01] <soahccc> kswedberg: Well then my options aren't used at all
[05:58:14] <jorisw> I thought maybe both could be fired. Don't see why the local click event couldn't be fired also.
[05:58:46] <Cork> jorisw: events bubble, you don't have two click positions
[05:58:55] <jorisw> ok, tyvm
[05:59:03] <Cork> just like you can cancle key events to the browser from an input field
[05:59:04] <kswedberg> soahccc: sorry. spoke too soon. just a sec.
[05:59:14] <Cork> *cancel
[05:59:26] <juha_> when is somebody going to release toffeescript?
[05:59:40] <NodeX> soahccc : try .. this.opts= $.extend...
[05:59:41] <aaronmcadam> sticky syntax?
[06:01:03] <soahccc> NodeX: The thing is, the options are not the problem. The problem are the other variables (where I save the elements in). I just save them in normal variables as prototype provides objects, instances so there is a scope by default. I think this is different in jquery, isn't it?
[06:01:37] <NodeX> I dont know what's getting overwritten so I can't help
[06:01:38] <soahccc> line 19 to 22
[06:01:52] <soahccc> I define them in line 2
[06:02:01] <NodeX> use var
[06:02:06] <NodeX> you are making them global
[06:02:11] <NodeX> var id=...
[06:02:54] <NodeX> var will make them in that scope / itteration of each()
[06:02:56] <soahccc> NodeX: Then I can't access them in other functions
[06:02:56] <kswedberg> NodeX: he's var-ing them in line 2
[06:03:17] <soahccc> I just need to save variables for each instance of the plugin
[06:03:36] <NodeX> then they are getting overwritten in the scope kswedberg
[06:03:40] <NodeX> wtf lol
[06:04:05] <aaronmcadam> oh hey kswedberg congrats on getting the new book out, got it beside me, haven't dug in yet,do u cover Deffereds?
[06:06:11] <kswedberg> aaronmcadam: thanks! yeah, Deferreds/Promises in chapters 11  and 13
[06:06:29] <aaronmcadam> ah thanks man!
[06:06:41] <soahccc> NodeX: I think I need $(this).data is this right?
[06:06:51] <aaronmcadam> kswedberg: anything else a more advanced user like me would like?
[06:08:28] <aaronmcadam> So Animations and AJAX return promises now
[06:09:21] <kswedberg> aaronmcadam: chapters 9-13 are more or less "advanced" chapters. and chapter 8, developing plugins, has some good stuff
[06:10:15] <kswedberg> yes! calling .promise() on an animation is clutch!
[06:10:30] <aaronmcadam> cheers kswedberg :) i wrote to the reviewer guy from packt about the possibility of any advanced js books coming out. it's tough to find a book that doesn't rehash the basics every time. tho i do understand why books are released like that
[06:10:52] <aaronmcadam> ya I came across that on danherberden's awesome Deffered slides site
[06:11:28] <aaronmcadam> for those of u who aren't following: danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/
[06:12:44] <kswedberg> aaronmcadam: I know what you mean. publishers like to hit the "sweet spot" in terms of potential purchasers.
[06:12:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah :)
[06:13:58] <aaronmcadam> kswedberg: books like http://recipeswithbackbone.com/ will always be viable enough
[06:14:19] <aaronmcadam> just it's nice to have a printed book
[06:15:37] <kswedberg> yeah. that looks like a neat book. wasn't aware of that one. books like that one are probably more viable when self-published.
[06:16:02] <aaronmcadam> yeah, I've bought that one, haven't read it yet!
[06:16:15] <aaronmcadam> just finishing off a jqmobile and bbone project, nearly there
[06:17:05] * NodeX shudders at the thought of JS as a template solution
[06:17:08] <aaronmcadam> you been playing with anything cool lately kswedberg?
[06:17:13] <m4xx> i'm trying to create my own context menu. this is what i've for my init function. can anyone offer a more elegant solution? i think i could do this a much better way: http://paste2.org/p/1705159
[06:17:33] <aaronmcadam> Have you had a look at Ender?
[06:18:14] <NodeX> m4xx : is that cross browser ?
[06:18:20] <m4xx> don't know yet
[06:18:37] <m4xx> i test in firefox and fix for everything else
[06:18:39] <NodeX> it isnt
[06:18:57] <NodeX> if you are trying to replicate a right click menu then there is 3 cases
[06:18:59] <NodeX> iirc
[06:19:02] <aaronmcadam> you'd need to make sure u supress all defaults
[06:19:21] <NodeX> of which there is 3 iirc - maybe more now with more chrommes
[06:20:01] <m4xx> my main concern is the way im testing for my target
[06:20:05] <kswedberg> aaronmcadam: just a cursory look. I've been using a homespun Rakefile to do a lot of that stuff. but I like the idea of letting someone else do all the hard work for me. ;)
[06:20:24] <m4xx> if i have a label in a table cell, it captures the click on the cell
[06:20:25] <aaronmcadam> true, an npm for the frontend looks awesome
[06:20:52] <NodeX> you're walking up the DOM from * which is a bad idea
[06:21:00] <m4xx> yeah
[06:21:05] <NodeX> well up to your #id
[06:21:30] <NodeX> capture on #id and use closest('.selctor-you-are-looking-to-find');
[06:21:51] <m4xx> the closest is going to go up similar to parent, correct?
[06:21:58] <soahccc> yeah $(this).data does work for me :)
[06:22:25] <NodeX> yer
[06:22:29] <NodeX> ?closest
[06:22:30] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[06:22:38] <m4xx> yeah,
[06:22:46] <m4xx> so if i do the click on the #table
[06:22:54] <m4xx> it's not going to register when i click the cells
[06:23:10] <NodeX> it will
[06:23:10] <m4xx> or on a label with in the cell
[06:23:13] <m4xx> hmm
[06:23:17] <NodeX> the table is the parent
[06:23:25] <NodeX> anything inside the table will call a click
[06:23:47] <NodeX> $(this); will be the table .. you are watching document for it ...
[06:23:59] <kswedberg> soahccc: I've been playing with that plugin pattern a bit. this one is in a state of disarray at the moment, but maybe you can glean some ideas from it? http://pastebin.com/QTVV59N0
[06:24:02] <NodeX> I built one a year ago .. I'll see if I can dig it out
[06:25:03] <jeffsmykil> Basic javascript question: http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWqw/12/  How come my code doesn't make the first table look like the second?
[06:25:04] <danieliser> ie7 height auto.. when i use slideDown() the object slides down to the bottom of the screen then snaps back to the correct size.. works fine in all others
[06:25:22] <m4xx> ahh, now i see where i went wrong
[06:25:26] <soahccc> kswedberg: The thing is that I only have "this" if I call these methods on the element but if I want to call them inside the plugin I have to pass the data around
[06:25:56] <soahccc> kswedberg: Now looks like this --> http://pastebin.com/duVmbR1u
[06:26:35] * alaing is waiting for iOS5 to be released today
[06:27:24] * jeffsmykil gives js fiddle a little kick
[06:27:27] <soahccc> alaing: Do you know (maybe) how to clone a iphone filesystem to restore it as it is?
[06:27:47] <jeffsmykil> actually like this http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWqw/13/
[06:28:29] <jeffsmykil> alaing: that's going to be the slowest download ever
[06:28:32] <DaveJ|UK> Anyone know of a plugin that displays a modal "Loading" dialog after a link or a button is clicked?
[06:28:40] <alaing> soahccc: itunes should be able to do it for you
[06:28:52] <DaveJ|UK> I have a control panel that performs some complex operations that can take a few seconds to return, and users and repeatedly clicking
[06:29:14] <jeffsmykil> DaveJ|UK:  is it an ajax post or a normal post?
[06:29:20] <DaveJ|UK> normal
[06:29:30] <alaing> jeffsmykil: i know i've been checking the apple support forum and laughing at some people asking what time will it be release and has it been release or is it just them not getting the release today
[06:29:32] <DaveJ|UK> GET if its a normal link
[06:30:11] <soahccc> alaing: I mean as it is. exactly. with all modifications (jailbreak, cydia apps & settings, own modifications) and so on
[06:30:12] <jeffsmykil> couldn't you use the jquery ui modal dialog box and put a spinner image in it when you start the post?
[06:30:17] <gnarf> DaveJ|UK: disable the link after the click?
[06:30:29] <jeffsmykil> ooh that's a better idea from gnarf
[06:30:40] <DaveJ|UK> people would think its broken
[06:30:46] <DaveJ|UK> it needs to let them know it is doing something
[06:30:52] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: pleased to be looking?  http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWqw/13/
[06:30:57] <gnarf> or, use a modal if you want - but its going to be interrupting
[06:31:11] <DaveJ|UK> it works well in Plesk
[06:31:15] <jeffsmykil> DaveJ|UK: you could turn the cursor into the waiting cursor?
[06:31:23] <jeffsmykil> on click
[06:31:45] <DaveJ|UK> i dont think thats obvious enough for most users but it would be a good addition
[06:31:57] <DaveJ|UK> it definitely needs a modal
[06:32:06] <jeffsmykil> then just use the jquery modal
[06:32:09] <NodeX> I disable my buttons while things are happening then on success I re-enable them
[06:32:11] <jeffsmykil> and append a spinner on post
[06:32:52] <DaveJ|UK> Nodex: that assumes AJAX
[06:32:56] <jeffsmykil> personally I like to flash the words THINKING in bright red whenever a user clicks a button
[06:33:05] <DaveJ|UK> ..
[06:33:11] <DaveJ|UK> ids2u
[06:33:12] <kswedberg> DaveJ|UK: you could use http://malsup.com/jquery/block/
[06:33:14] <jeffsmykil> sorry, not being rude just silly
[06:33:25] <jeffsmykil> i think jquery ui has a modal dialog
[06:33:43] <alaing> soahccc: if not I'm sure theres an app.  Dont know I've never had to clone a iphone
[06:34:05] <jeffsmykil> i wonder if carbon copy cloner can clone an iphone alaing
[06:34:27] <soahccc> alaing: Just asked :) I saw a possibility that you might know that
[06:35:12] <kswedberg> DaveJ|UK: or, like other people said, if you're already loading jQuery UI, use something like this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal
[06:35:53] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: you can't just put partial html into shit with append
[06:36:03] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: build a string, then append the whole thing?
[06:36:09] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: oh...
[06:36:26] <alaing> soahccc: iDrive lite? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9h4gSXkYrg&feature=related
[06:36:54] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: I did not know that was a caveat of append
[06:37:49] <gnarf> well like append always appends right
[06:37:57] <jeffsmykil> right
[06:38:03] <jeffsmykil> but i thought if cut it up like this
[06:38:06] <jeffsmykil> the appends would line up
[06:38:12] <gnarf> so its adding a new tr for each of those things cuz its being put outside of the last tr
[06:38:39] <jeffsmykil> but there is no closing tr on the first pme
[06:38:45] <gnarf> its added
[06:38:45] <jeffsmykil> one
[06:38:53] <gnarf> because its not valid without it
[06:38:59] <jeffsmykil> ah
[06:39:00] <gnarf> you have to append real HTML
[06:39:17] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: the DOM works in terms of Elements, not strings
[06:39:18] <jeffsmykil> when you say real you mean valid?
[06:39:29] <gnarf> yes
[06:39:30] <ajpiano> so when you're building elements from strings, you have to build entire Elements
[06:39:39] <gnarf> also, what ajpiano said
[06:39:42] <jeffsmykil> so i should have a variable
[06:39:47] <ajpiano> if you don't, jQuery will make those things into elements
[06:39:49] <jeffsmykil> and just build that variable using this method
[06:39:57] <jeffsmykil> then append the string value of the variable
[06:40:07] <kswedberg> jeffsmykil: it would probably make more sense to build up the html into a single string or whatever and then append it all at once.
[06:40:52] <jeffsmykil> it isn't push for strings
[06:40:54] <jeffsmykil> that's arrays
[06:40:56] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: i hope you realize you just had 2 team members and a UI guy all give you the same advice ;)
[06:40:59] * jeffsmykil grabs his js book
[06:41:18] <jeffsmykil> that's because im so beloved
[06:41:26] <kswedberg> lol :)
[06:41:31] <Hopsy|2> Can someone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/E4MbS/
[06:41:46] <jeffsmykil> ty
[06:41:54] <gnarf> um
[06:42:15] <gnarf> Hopsy|2: .parents().filter("ul").length ?
[06:42:35] <Hopsy|2> lets see if that works :p
[06:42:41] <Hopsy|2> parents ?
[06:42:43] <Hopsy|2> with s ?
[06:42:46] <gnarf> ?parents
[06:42:46] <bot-t> .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[06:42:52] <gnarf> parent only goes one step
[06:43:07] <Hopsy|2> ow now my script works
[06:43:17] <Hopsy|2> http://jsfiddle.net/E4MbS/1/
[06:43:22] <gnarf> you could also just .parents( "ul" ).length
[06:43:31] <gnarf> you don't want find
[06:43:39] <Hopsy|2> yes that was the next step :p
[06:43:42] <gnarf> find looks within each of the elements for more ul's
[06:43:43] <Hopsy|2> thanks
[06:44:00] <jeffsmykil> can I concat a string?
[06:44:33] <jeffsmykil> to the end of it i mean
[06:44:55] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: += ?
[06:45:03] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/E4MbS/3/ @Hopsy|2
[06:45:24] <gnarf> your parents().find() method would have found 4 uls there
[06:45:31] <gnarf> actually it would have found ALL the ul's on the page
[06:46:00] <Hopsy|2> ahh, got it
[06:46:47] <Hopsy|2> I never have seen the parentsss function
[06:47:27] <gnarf> Hopsy|2: also, note the difference between .filter( "ul" ) and .find( "ul" )
[06:47:47] <alaing> just me or does js fiddle break in ie7
[06:48:00] <gnarf> alaing: editing is broken in low ies
[06:48:14] <gnarf> alaing: but the site itself should stull run the demo correctly
[06:48:45] <gnarf> also, you can add /show to the the fiddle URL to test just the output if you want - i find that helps
[06:48:46] <alaing> grrr....like resiizing the panels. is dead slow and not responsive.
[06:49:01] <gnarf> alaing: thats what you get for trying to use IE7 ;)
[06:49:15] <Hopsy> I still dont know the difference :(. filter does filter the whole page? and find stops after found one element?
[06:49:24] <aaronmcadam> you can use the cool show feature too
[06:49:25] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/QvhhD/show/
[06:49:25] <gnarf> Hopsy: way off
[06:49:30] <gnarf> Hopsy: see ?filter
[06:49:30] <bot-t> Hopsy, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[06:49:33] <aaronmcadam> gnarf, did u know that :D
[06:49:52] <illourr> question: _END vs closing out php and writing html.
[06:50:20] <gnarf> Hopsy: filter goes through the "matched set" and filters it down to be only things matching the selector
[06:50:25] <gnarf> so .parents() gets all the parents
[06:50:34] <gnarf> and filter can limit it to only things that are UL
[06:50:57] <gnarf> were .find() actually searches >from< each item in the matched set down
[06:51:13] <Hopsy> and closest?
[06:51:33] <gnarf> Hopsy: closest is a little strange
[06:51:35] <gnarf> ?closest
[06:51:35] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[06:51:37] <Hopsy> :P
[06:51:54] <gnarf> it checks itself, then .parents() looking or the first item to match the selector

[06:52:33] <m4xx> NodeX: don't suppose you dug up those conditionals did ya?
[06:52:36] <gnarf> .closest( "ul" ) for instance would only find zero or one UL's

[06:52:57] <Hopsy> okay, thanks for your help
[06:53:01] <kborchers> heh
[06:53:12] <NodeX> m4xx : I can't find them lol
[06:53:12] <empireoflight> how can I use load() to replace the contents of a div with the contents in an external html file? Not just append the contents of the external file to whatever's in the div
[06:53:22] <NodeX> which is gutting because I need them in a few days myselkf
[06:53:23] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWqw/18/ I am using += incorectly?
[06:53:25] <m4xx> oh well, thanks for lookin =]
[06:53:29] <NodeX> nps
[06:53:41] <jeffsmykil> empireoflight: empty the div first?
[06:53:43] <m4xx> if i find 'em i'll pass 'em your way =]
[06:53:50] <empireoflight> aha
[06:54:04] <jeffsmykil> .empty()
[06:54:14] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, quotes, mofo - do you use them?
[06:54:19] <kborchers> hah
[06:54:27] <kborchers> i was about to say similar
[06:54:34] <jeffsmykil> blackspotwiggins: i can haz quotes?
[06:54:51] <blackspotwiggins> srsly, in the 6 months you have idled here, you have not mastered string types in js
[06:54:52] <NodeX> nice one m4xx :)
[06:54:53] <blackspotwiggins> wtf
[06:55:01] <NodeX> hehe
[06:55:09] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: if you use quotes properly, strings tend to concatenate much better
[06:55:16] <aaronmcadam> haha
[06:55:23] <jeffsmykil> yes yes laugh at me all of yo
[06:55:25] <aaronmcadam> yeah "better" as in "they work"
[06:55:34] <jeffsmykil> i will feed off of your glee muwahahahah
[06:55:40] <aaronmcadam> why don't u just use join
[06:55:47] <aaronmcadam> it's actually faster than concatenation ;)
[06:55:55] <NodeX> join ftw
[06:56:00] <jeffsmykil> someone told me to use +=
[06:56:24] <jeffsmykil> isnt join only for arrays?
[06:56:34] <aaronmcadam> ?eval ['this', 'is', 'the', 'string', 'jeffsmykil', 'can\'t', 'concatenate'].join( ' ' )
[06:56:35] <empireoflight> jeffsmykil thanks for that
[06:56:36] <jeffsmykil> blackspotwiggins: and im y defense I don't think it's been six months
[06:56:37] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "this is the string jeffsmykil can't concatenate"
[06:56:50] <aaronmcadam> see?
[06:57:14] <blackspotwiggins> rly?
[06:57:16] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: that still requires proper quotes though so ....
[06:57:17] <illourr> they should add a section on stackoverflow with irc channels like this one..
[06:57:21] <aaronmcadam> hahah yeah
[06:57:30] <aaronmcadam> it's a fuckin string tho
[06:57:31] <jeffsmykil> yes yes im the moron
[06:57:33] <aaronmcadam> that's so simple
[06:57:53] <jeffsmykil> i will make sure to laugh at you when any of you come to me with a music theory question@!
[06:57:55] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery/2011-03-28
[06:58:08] <blackspotwiggins> so ok, 5.5 months
[06:58:27] <kborchers> sorry jeffsmykil, i'll lay off now. just helps to debug your own scripts as much as possible before throwing your code out for others to see ... and mock ;)
[06:58:28] <blackspotwiggins> actually 6.5
[06:58:41] <jeffsmykil> i apologize
[06:58:49] <jeffsmykil> i am adequately demoralized, thank you
[07:00:03] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: im tryin to use a deceptive cadence but it dont works right
[07:00:27] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you probably suck lolrlorosz
[07:00:35] <ajpiano> can i show you my staves
[07:00:37] <jeffsmykil> do you have parallel octaves or fifths lolororoz
[07:00:47] <ajpiano> lol wat is parell fifth
[07:00:55] <ajpiano> rules r made to be broken
[07:01:03] <jeffsmykil> tell that to js
[07:01:38] <NodeX> I have a diaper that won't scale properly, I keep making poopy's but it never refers to the current data() on teh element.. shall I blame the parent()
[07:02:48] <danieliser> ie7 height auto.. when i use slideDown() the object slides down to the bottom of the screen then snaps back to the correct size.. works fine in all others
[07:02:51] <danieliser> ideas?
[07:03:16] <blackspotwiggins> ie7 is retarded, and it's the least used IE, skip it
[07:03:22] <NodeX> IE7 is a bk
[07:03:29] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: first you must master the rules then you can break them.  charlie parker didn't start by playing random notes
[07:03:44] <ajpiano> yeah everyone knows charlie parker started as a valet
[07:03:48] <ajpiano> that's how he got his nickname
[07:03:49] <ajpiano> charlie "parker"
[07:04:01] <jeffsmykil> nickname == bird
[07:04:07] <jeffsmykil> or yardbird
[07:04:31] <jeffsmykil> all you suckers went to school for CS or engineering, I went for something useful, Music lol
[07:04:37] <NodeX> me too
[07:04:41] <NodeX> sound engineering
[07:04:49] <ajpiano> i went to school for music, but switched to theatre
[07:04:51] * NodeX is self taught
[07:04:55] <ajpiano> :x
[07:04:58] <gnarf> i never went to school
[07:05:07] <jeffsmykil> I went for music ed
[07:05:10] <jeffsmykil> i taught music
[07:05:22] <muzone> jeffsmykil: can we hear some of the music you've made?
[07:05:24] <NodeX> I went to rain hell on teachers :P
[07:05:25] <jeffsmykil> i can play every instrument at a sixth grade level
[07:05:32] <blackspotwiggins> "something useful, Music" compared to engineering
[07:05:55] <NodeX> CS taught in school is bad anyway .. it teaches bad robot programming
[07:06:00] <Coderah> NodeX: self taught = win
[07:06:03] <NodeX> no flare ... all the best programmers are self taught
[07:06:11] <blackspotwiggins> depends on the school i think
[07:06:14] <NodeX> not bound by the BS imo
[07:06:16] <muzone> jeffsmykil: can we hear some of the music you've made?
[07:06:19] <muzone> ha
[07:06:21] <Coderah> NodeX: well said.
[07:06:28] <blackspotwiggins> if you look past the bs examples, the theory is quite useful
[07:06:32] <jeffsmykil> muzone: what you want to hear my senior recital?
[07:06:47] <NodeX> I constantly get paid to -fix- other's mistakes who have degrees in CS
[07:07:01] <jeffsmykil> i said all of this tongue and cheek...
[07:07:07] <NodeX> It's not even bad mistakes - most are just silly
[07:07:14] <jeffsmykil> i know engineers don't get social cues and all but... ;)
[07:07:16] <NodeX> LMFAO
[07:07:32] <NodeX> I thought that said rectum then for a second
[07:08:04] <m4xx> damn near killed 'em
[07:08:24] <NodeX> anyone got a select list of array containing the world timezones and offsets in seconds from GMT so I dont have to make one?
[07:08:28] * NodeX begs
[07:08:32] <m4xx> People with CS degrees are either brilliant or morons
[07:08:52] <m4xx> in my experience anyway
[07:08:55] <jeffsmykil> i took two or three courses in college for CS i couldn't deal with the people
[07:09:01] <NodeX> there are a few exceptions to the rule
[07:09:18] <NodeX> but in general a bad teacher will teach bad code
[07:09:30] <jeffsmykil> a bad teacher will teach a book
[07:09:52] <m4xx> I'm self taught also, the only thing I don't like are the things that I don't know that I don't know.
[07:10:03] <NodeX> for example .. CS with reisig would produce good coders ... CS with Bill gates would produce robots
[07:10:09] <jeffsmykil> i like those things, makes it an adventure
[07:11:16] <NodeX> I like the google doodle today clol
[07:11:17] <jeffsmykil> ok I have added my quotes like a champ, now I get the undefined at the beginning of the string from the var value; declaration
[07:11:26] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: yeah, it's fun
[07:11:40] <NodeX> pastebin jeffsmykil lol
[07:11:48] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/ZXWqw/21/
[07:12:22] <cruxst> Why exactly GOOG think Number as a single primitive is a flaw?
[07:12:29] <NodeX> var value='';
[07:12:32] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: I'm sure I would love your parallel octaves
[07:12:48] <jeffsmykil> NodeX: I guess that makes sense
[07:12:49] <NodeX> will cast as a string
[07:12:51] <NodeX> lol
[07:13:14] <ajpiano> yeah man, a couple parallel octaves in the low end, slam it home babe
[07:13:41] <jeffsmykil> recipe for red ink
[07:13:57] <NodeX> get white ink and add blood ?
[07:13:59] <jeffsmykil> and ridicule like i have received today from some professor
[07:14:16] <jeffsmykil> oh i see what you did there NodeX!
[07:14:17] <ajpiano> i stopped doing music theory in college for the same reason i never did CS - it's  like, not enjoyable in academia
[07:14:49] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: I dont think i learned anything in music theory in college until level 4/4 when we did german, italian and french 2nds
[07:15:09] <ajpiano> i didn't make it that far
[07:15:21] <NodeX> I can barely play the triangle lol
[07:15:29] <ajpiano> i stopped in 2nd semester when i had a condescending french prof
[07:15:37] <jeffsmykil> the hand muting on triangle is trickier than you may think
[07:15:49] <NodeX> I mean hitting it once a bar lol
[07:15:50] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: I had a cuban one that looked like sam the eagle
[07:15:54] <m4xx> is .bind('contextmenu') cross browser?
[07:16:02] <ajpiano> m4xx: yes
[07:16:07] <NodeX> which is weird as I've got mad rhythm and hand ear coordination
[07:16:17] <m4xx> awesome
[07:16:20] <NodeX> I dont think it is ajpiano
[07:16:30] <NodeX> iirc opera 9 sucks
[07:16:41] <ajpiano> opera 9 is irrelevant
[07:16:55] <NodeX> corrs browser maenas it's not
[07:17:00] <NodeX> cross *
[07:17:04] <ajpiano> that's not true
[07:17:15] <ajpiano> opera 9 is old as hell at this point, opera users tend to upgrade quickly
[07:17:20] <jeffsmykil> ooh a semantic fight on the internet, this should end well!
[07:17:28] <blackspotwiggins> i bet links2 does not support it as well, not crossbrowser
[07:17:47] <jeffsmykil> wasn't it lynx?
[07:17:49] <aaronmcadam> lynx!
[07:17:50] <aaronmcadam> :D
[07:17:54] <m4xx> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1870880/opera-custom-context-menu-picking-up-the-right-click
[07:17:57] <m4xx> =[
[07:18:05] <blackspotwiggins> there is lynx, links and links2, and elinks IIRC
[07:18:29] <jeffsmykil> huh
[07:18:30] <pr0ton> so i have this method that is delayed inside a loop, how do i access the iterator inside the loop, if i access, it usually gives me the last (since the loop has terminated)
[07:18:33] <jeffsmykil> yeah you are old blackspotwiggins
[07:18:37] <NodeX> http://testground.finnrudolph.de/js/right_click_menu/ <--- look at the source m4xx
[07:18:41] <ajpiano> pr0ton: use a closure
[07:18:49] <blackspotwiggins> jeffsmykil, knowing stuff = old?
[07:19:03] <NodeX> and the source js ... and find the line suppressBrowserMenu
[07:19:10] <NodeX> shows you how to hack it
[07:19:12] <jeffsmykil> when you have that vivid of a memory of browsers before netscape 2 probably
[07:19:25] <quicksilver> NCSA Mosaic
[07:19:31] <blackspotwiggins> they are rather current
[07:19:35] <quicksilver> I can still see the icon as if it was yesterday
[07:19:41] <quicksilver> however, links I use almost every day
[07:19:55] <jeffsmykil> lynx is quite old, isn't it?
[07:19:59] <blackspotwiggins> links 2.3 was released this summer i think
[07:20:37] <aaronmcadam> ah, based on vim?
[07:20:49] <blackspotwiggins> browser based on vim??!
[07:20:57] <aaronmcadam> that's what it says
[07:21:11] <aaronmcadam> "HTML written in VIM."
[07:21:11] <NodeX> lynx rules
[07:21:21] <pr0ton> ajpiano, ok, so something like var f = function(iterator) { /*code*/ }; f();
[07:21:23] <m4xx> why would e.preventDefault not exist? earlier versions of jquery?
[07:21:40] <aaronmcadam> preventDefault is js tho
[07:21:41] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, sounds weird
[07:21:51] <m4xx> ah
[07:22:01] <ajpiano> pr0ton: for ( ... ) {  (function() { })(i)  }
[07:22:13] <pr0ton> ajpiano, ah cooler, thanks :)
[07:22:15] <ajpiano> pr0ton: or just use jQuery.each(objorarray fn)
[07:22:21] <quicksilver> ajpiano: "HTML written in VIM" refers to the web page.
[07:22:26] <quicksilver> erm
[07:22:27] <quicksilver> aaronmcadam: ^^
[07:22:33] <aaronmcadam> yesyes
[07:22:41] <quicksilver> links is not based on vim. that webpage was written in vim.
[07:23:07] <NodeX> vim blows. ... MS notepad ftw
[07:23:08] <aaronmcadam> trying to find out which renderer to png it's using
[07:23:10] <NodeX> lmfao
[07:23:23] <blackspotwiggins> notepad :D
[07:23:32] <blackspotwiggins> only ms word is worse as a text editor
[07:23:44] <NodeX> MSword rulez the pack
[07:23:47] <Haprog> vim ftw. I use it for writing/editing PHP/HTML/JS regularly. And Notepad++ on Windows
[07:24:11] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, that you? http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HhgewoBjiEg/Rf__y3LLAGI/AAAAAAAAAyE/S-abd9bryXg/s320/WORD.bmp
[07:24:14] <jeffsmykil> notepad ++ for the win
[07:24:16] <Haprog> blackspotwiggins: or wordpad
[07:24:41] <pr0ton> ajpiano, still same :(
[07:24:56] <ajpiano> pr0ton: i haven't seen your code tbh
[07:25:02] <ajpiano> so i don't know what's wrong
[07:25:25] <jeffsmykil> however he knows what's wrong with mine!  I'm a moron!
[07:25:40] <pr0ton> ajpiano, http://pastebin.com/R5jJRnqz
[07:25:58] <pr0ton> ajpiano, 11 to 35 is the closure
[07:26:15] <ajpiano> pr0ton: why aren't you just enclosing the entire contents of the loop
[07:26:31] <Haprog> I like Notepad++ for: highlighting, tabs, ftp/sftp integration, easy record/play macros, changing charset and EOL character support, regex search/replace, etc. :)
[07:26:31] <ajpiano> i think you should just use $.each( path, function(i) {    });
[07:27:42] <ajpiano> pr0ton: also you aren't passing the 'i' into the closure
[07:27:51] <ajpiano> well, you're passing it but you're not receiving it
[07:28:00] <ajpiano> so it's just using the I that has persisted post-for-loop
[07:28:09] <ajpiano> again it's a lot simpler to just use $.each here..
[07:30:13] <Cade> can someone take a look at this? I'm trying to have images fade out from right to left, revealing another image underneath, and cycling through continuously. Not only is it not working correctly, but it keeps crashing by browser. http://pastebin.com/kk57y3zS
[07:30:46] <danieliser> ie7 height auto.. when i use slideDown() the object slides down to the bottom of the screen then snaps back to the correct size.. works fine in all others
[07:30:50] <danieliser> no ideas then?
[07:31:12] <Cade> There is a function, "repeat" that is supposed to get called after 5 seconds, but it's getting called as soon as the page loads.
[07:32:00] <ajpiano> Cade: you have to pass a *reference* to the function if you want to use it as the callback
[07:32:06] <ajpiano> right now you are executing it
[07:32:29] <ajpiano> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[07:33:03] <rayvan> good morning gentlemen
[07:33:45] <rayvan> how would you approach targeting an element that has the same class across many rows on click?
[07:33:57] <jeffsmykil> give them unique IDs?
[07:34:19] <context> rayvan:  click.....
[07:34:27] <context> or you want a specific item
[07:34:36] <context> or any one of them
[07:34:36] <rayvan> specific item that was just clicked
[07:34:48] <context> single it out... in SOME way
[07:34:54] <context> id, another class, a data- tag
[07:34:56] <context> anything...
[07:35:01] <ajpiano> rayvan: $(".foo").click(function() { $(this).doSomething();  })
[07:35:01] <jeffsmykil> i give them unique IDs target the class on click, then find the att(id)
[07:35:20] <jeffsmykil> and again his idea is better
[07:35:23] <Cade> Ok. How do I set that up since the function is going to keep getting called every five seconds?
[07:35:26] <rayvan> theres no way to just filter it to the element clicked?
[07:35:31] <context> he just said he wanted a single item
[07:35:33] <context> not any of them
[07:35:43] <jeffsmykil> rayvan: look at ajpiano's response
[07:36:06] <ajpiano> rayvan: the clicked element is always 'this' and 'event.target' inside of the handler
[07:36:07] <context> re-word your question
[07:36:09] <rayvan> i would like to avoid id's if possible, as the markup is being generated automatically through the backend
[07:36:10] <ajpiano> you don't have to "target" it
[07:36:26] <cruxst> Cade, do repeat not repeat()
[07:37:00] <rayvan> i can potentially use one of the parent elements that has a unique row number...however it has multiple classes, class="row row-2 row-blah"
[07:37:28] <rayvan> is parents() bad for performance though?
[07:37:33] <ajpiano> rayvan: if you need to traverse to the row itself, you can do $(this).closest("tr")
[07:37:40] <ajpiano> rayvan: use closest instead of parents
[07:37:48] <rayvan> ok ill try that thank you
[07:37:54] <cruxst> Cade $("#slice" + i).delay(5000 + i).animate({ opacity: 0 }, "slow", repeat); // note removed parentheses
[07:38:06] <jeffsmykil> sorry i made that harder for you ajpiano
[07:38:11] <ajpiano> twss
[07:38:26] <jeffsmykil> indeed
[07:38:44] <rayvan> so i can traverse the count of the markup since I don't have the number...? like .closest("div span div") ?
[07:39:16] <Cade> Ok. I did that. It's not crashing any more, but now it's fading across once, then it just keeps snapping to the next picture.
[07:39:36] <rayvan> how would i know how to grab the specific unique class out of the classes is my question i guess
[07:42:02] <cruxst> Cade: you need to use timers
[07:42:23] <danzik171> rayvan: so you want a specific class but don't know the class?  do you at least know the class prefix and do you want the greatest number or something?
[07:42:46] <rayvan> i know the prefix, it is consistent
[07:42:55] <Cade> Never mind. I wasn't resetting the opacity correctly.
[07:43:05] <rayvan> danzik171: ^
[07:43:36] <danzik171> rayvan: ok.  how are you deciding what the id/number of the class is then?
[07:43:54] <cruxst> Cade, congrats. now go refactor this thing
[07:44:37] <rayvan> danzik171: thats the hiccup i'm trying to work on...i need to grab the one class out of the other classes in that parent row
[07:45:06] <Cade> refactor?
[07:45:09] <rayvan> even if I had an id, i'd still have to determine the number on click
[07:45:26] <Cade> Is performing 300 simultaneous but staggered fades not something that a browser should be expected to handle?
[07:45:28] <rayvan> well...maybe i just make it a separate nested element...
[07:45:31] <danzik171> rayvan: and how are you determining the number?
[07:46:16] <rayvan> its a sequence of rows...on click of the inner element
[07:46:23] <rayvan> not sure if thats the answer youre looking for danzik171
[07:46:56] <danzik171> rayvan: not really - it'd be easier to understand this if you create a ?fiddle
[07:47:14] <danzik171> bah - whats the bot shortcut for that
[07:47:23] <Cade> cruxst, what do you mean "refactor"?
[07:48:02] <cruxst> Cade there are many things you're doing that aren't considered good practice for JS
[07:48:19] <Cade> Such as?
[07:48:29] <Aquaguy> Hey there people.
[07:48:32] <dpy2> hi guys
[07:48:48] <dpy2> does anyone know how to get the bounding box of a css3-transformed DOM element?
[07:49:15] <cruxst> Cade using delay() instead of timers, doing $("#slice" + i) four times in a row
[07:50:11] <Aquaguy> I'm trying to create a plugin, $.alert({text: 'Some text'}); I know how to do plugins when instead of doing $.alert() I do $('#foo').alert();
[07:50:28] <Aquaguy> is there any way to create a custom function for the $ object?
[07:50:39] <Aquaguy> such as $.get or $.ajax
[07:51:24] <Cade> do you mean this timer? http://plugins.jquery.com/project/timers
[07:51:47] <jomofcw> How could I catch all A element except those which have a parent that match the selector #myID ?
[07:51:53] <cruxst> Cade, I mean setTimer()
[07:52:01] <cruxst> ?timers

[07:52:23] <Aquaguy> anyone?
[07:52:24] <cruxst> no not those
[07:53:00] <cruxst> Aquaguy: $.alert = function(){alert()}
[07:53:18] <cruxst> Aquaguy: $ is merely an object
[07:53:31] <Aquaguy> oh ok
[07:53:32] <Aquaguy> thanks
[07:57:51] <m4xx> any one care to offer some constructive criticisms? http://jsfiddle.net/upDvP/2/
[07:59:04] <necromancer> how much damage does having a selector in the DOM ready do when it's not being used on every page/
[07:59:16] <necromancer> like i have a selector $('.replaceText")...it's not on EVERY page but it's on every form
[07:59:32] <ajpiano> m4xx: why don't you actually use the jquery ui widget factory
[07:59:41] <necromancer> if i put that in the dom ready, would it slow down my site noticeably?
[07:59:57] <m4xx> ajpiano: i'm not sure what you mean
[08:00:02] <ajpiano> necromancer: it certainly will not be noticable, but it is pointless
[08:00:11] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[08:00:16] <ajpiano> m4xx: there's a constructor function that is used to construct jquery ui widgets
[08:00:21] <ajpiano> with the API you've essentially built here
[08:00:29] <aaronmcadam> necromancer: you *could* make the element an id that'd be faster but meh
[08:00:30] <ajpiano> m4xx: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory
[08:00:44] <ajpiano> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[08:00:47] <necromancer> aaronmcadam: nah it's supposed to be applied to multiple items...it's a default text for form fields
[08:01:39] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[08:01:40] <ajpiano> m4xx: also, there *is* a menu component in the upcoming jquery ui 1.9 release :)
[08:01:49] <aaronmcadam> ah is that being revisited?
[08:01:59] <aaronmcadam> I remember that being tried out ages ago
[08:02:01] <ajpiano> m4xx: in other words, my feedback is, you've done a good job finding out what the reasonable pattern is :)
[08:02:31] <Cade> Ok, I now have it as: $.timer(5000 + i, function (timer) { $(eid).animate({ opacity: 0 }, "slow", repeat) });
[08:02:49] <ajpiano> m4xx: doing $.proxy(foo.bar, baz)() is kind of insane... compared to useing foo.bar.call( baz );
[08:03:13] <aaronmcadam> isn't $.proxy just doing that anyway?
[08:03:25] <aaronmcadam> or does it do extra checks on the context ajpiano ?
[08:03:28] <m4xx> yes, perhaps you're right ;[ i learned that on stack yesterday
[08:03:30] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: the point of proxy is typically to set the context once, and then use it later
[08:03:33] <aaronmcadam> to the srouce viewer :D
[08:03:40] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah
[08:03:49] <ajpiano> not like, wrap the function every single time and call it straightaway
[08:04:04] <Hopsy> The youtube video gnarf showed me last night is still funny, about the [object Object] issue
[08:04:04] <m4xx> i see your point, thank you
[08:04:16] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah
[08:04:23] <aaronmcadam> it's a cache really looking at the code
[08:04:25] <aaronmcadam> ?
[08:04:28] <ajpiano> m4xx: you should definitely take a look at the widget factory
[08:04:34] <ajpiano> it *is* this
[08:04:54] <ajpiano> only without you having to roll all the argument parsing and other infrastructur
[08:05:06] <ajpiano> also checkout the jquery ui menu widget http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/menu/contextmenu.html
[08:05:30] <cruxst> ajpiano: ddid you get sad after DART was announced?
[08:05:42] <ajpiano> no
[08:05:48] <quuxman> anybody here know some basic color theory?
[08:05:59] <aaronmcadam> haha I saw an article on hacker news about a dart to js compiler, like wtf is the poin
[08:06:01] <snover> Why does everyone keep making it uppercase?
[08:06:01] <aaronmcadam> t*
[08:06:01] <bot-t> (5 hours 36 mins ago) <coldhead> tell snover Committed revision 141200.
[08:06:06] <cruxst> ajpiano: but not euphoric either, eh?
[08:06:07] <snover> Itâ€™s not DoubleClick DART
[08:06:27] <ajpiano> cruxst: pretty skeptical of whether it'll actually be relevant
[08:06:28] <gnarf> quuxman: define color theory?
[08:06:36] <aaronmcadam> how u mix colours?
[08:06:46] <ajpiano> or just some trendy thing that generates a lot of handwringing and doesn't really change the game impactfully
[08:06:48] <quuxman> gnarf: Well, I want the fully saturated version of a given RGB color
[08:06:58] <m4xx> when using .call() is it .call(<context>,[arg1],[arg2]...) ?
[08:07:11] <gnarf> ?color
[08:07:11] <bot-t> Color Animations - Adds the ability to do color animations to jQuery. Version 2 is currently in beta: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/31/jquery-color-v2-beta-1-released/ jQuery 1.4+ required - Older versions http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[08:07:19] <gnarf> version 2 can do that
[08:07:20] <ajpiano> m4xx: yes, but you can also use .apply( context, [a, b, c] )
[08:07:37] <m4xx> awesome
[08:07:39] <quuxman> I found a formula on Wikipedia to get the hue angle from the RGB components, but I'm feeling to lazy to derive the saturated RGB from the hue angle
[08:07:49] <m4xx> i very much appreciate both of you're input =]
[08:08:03] <gnarf> quuxman: $.Color( "#abcdef" ).saturation( 1 );
[08:08:24] <quuxman> gnarf: welll shiit :)
[08:08:33] <gnarf> quuxman: although i suggest using the version on git
[08:08:35] <gnarf> instead of beta 1
[08:08:39] <gnarf> there have been some bugfixes
[08:09:01] <gnarf> http://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[08:09:14] <Cade> cruxst, I have this now http://pastebin.com/D7e1hrtv and it's snapping from the first picture to the second and then not doing anything.
[08:09:52] <cruxst> quuxman: http://mjijackson.com/2008/02/rgb-to-hsl-and-rgb-to-hsv-color-model-conversion-algorithms-in-javascript
[08:10:59] <aaronmcadam> quuxman: you could dig into SASS and find out how they do it
[08:11:06] <aaronmcadam> lighten/darken functions
[08:11:29] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: jQuery Color v2 has an API to edit colors
[08:11:33] <gnarf> to do just that sort of thing
[08:11:36] <aaronmcadam> noice
[08:11:50] <aaronmcadam> SASS' funcs are awesomey tho :D
[08:12:43] <quuxman> gnarf, cruxst: thanks, those are both quite helpful
[08:13:17] <quuxman> aaronmcadam: Yeah, I'm planning on using SASS for this project, but haven't implemented it yet
[08:13:34] <aaronmcadam> cool
[08:13:35] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: $.Color( "#abcdef" ).lightness( "-=0.25" ); -- 25% "darker"
[08:13:42] <aaronmcadam> sexy
[08:14:20] <Cade> I mean this. http://pastebin.com/2bfN8rhq forgot to pass in the id.
[08:14:32] <aaronmcadam> SASS: lighten(#ccc, 20%)
[08:14:41] <aaronmcadam> so not too much of a diff really
[08:15:25] <Cade> Now it's not even going to the next picture any more.
[08:18:16] <Cade> Can someone take a look at that and tell me what I'm doing wrong? It has something to do with the timer lines.
[08:19:11] <jomofcw> Anyone who use colorbox, the jQuery plugin ? please.
[08:19:49] <jomofcw> I would like to know if it's possible to get the colobox element ? Currently I'm doing $('#cboxLoadedContent') to get it but...
[08:22:15] <jomofcw> else, is it possible to easily extend jquery plugin like colorbox ?
[08:23:02] <amcsi_work> I'm trying to unbind and event by namespace from $(document.body). The event I want to unbind is the same event that is currently running. I called unbind with namespace and it does not remove the event (it is still listed in $(document.body).data('events')). Is this normal?
[08:23:21] <Andrew131> How can I retrieve a variable based on a string?  I.E. string is "1" and I want to get variable Marker1
[08:23:49] <ablomen> jomofcw, extend it how? do you want to add an html element to it or do you want it to make you coffee?
[08:24:38] <rahmen> Anyone had any trouble with Ã¥Ã¤Ã¶ and charset utf-8 when printing stuff from the js file to the page? The chars dispaly normally if I write them directly to the html file. Only having trouble when it comes from the js file.
[08:24:42] <ablomen> jomofcw, it has events you can bind to (and then "this" is the element) so you can easily add some stuff
[08:24:50] <smplstk> every time somebody says "coffee" on IRC, take a sip
[08:25:29] <jomofcw> ablomen make cofee could be good :)
[08:25:33] <ablomen> smplstk, join #coffeescript, you will never sleep again
[08:25:53] <jomofcw> ablomen $(this) return me a A element :/.
[08:27:24] <ablomen> jomofcw, oh yeah i might be mistaken, console.log(arguments) << it should be in there somewhere
[08:27:34] <ablomen> its been a while since i played with that
[08:27:57] <cruxst> Cade: for one, your getNextPic is buggy
[08:28:38] <ablomen> anyway time to go home, jomofcw there is also a colorbox google group in case this does not work
[08:28:55] <jomofcw> ablomen thanks for your help :)
[08:28:58] <m4xx> Where is the jquery summit held?
[08:31:38] <aaronmcadam> isn't it online?
[08:31:50] * alaing wonders how many iphones will be bricked after apple release iOS5
[08:33:22] <necromancer> alaing: 3GS should still be ok iirc
[08:33:32] <necromancer> 3GS and up
[08:34:19] <Celes> I have a question.. a designer wants me to create scroll bars that look like apple .. does a plugin for this exist?
[08:34:41] <DaveJ|UK> why would they want to do that?
[08:34:57] <Celes> they hate the default windows scroll bars..
[08:35:10] <alaing> Celes: use a different browser
[08:35:30] <Celes> we have to make the browser cross compatible
[08:35:50] <Celes> and soo.. im thinking of using scrolls.js or something
[08:35:53] <DaveJ|UK> ask them: if they were using safari on their apple mac and they came across a website that had Windows scrolls bars, would they think that was sensible?
[08:36:26] <necromancer> Celes: jScrollPane maybe?
[08:36:46] <Celes> yeah thats what Im thinking
[08:36:53] <Celes> DaveJ|UK I know its a stupid request
[08:36:59] <DaveJ|UK> its just a dumb idea, its bad user interface design
[08:37:22] <Celes> the designer doesnt do web a lot
[08:37:25] <Accelerator> Is there a jQuery code I can use to replace a certain string of text on a form submit?
[08:37:26] <Celes> soo.. you can imagine..
[08:37:45] <Accelerator> Eg. If a text box has "foo" in it, when the user clicks submit, replace that with "bar" before processing the form
[08:37:47] <DaveJ|UK> you shouldnt be shy about telling them what will work and what wont

[08:41:06] <DaveJ|UK> you can change the colour, not sure about anything else
[08:41:10] <DaveJ|UK> it WILL look retarded though
[08:41:28] <Cade> What do you mean? It cycles through the images array, then repeats, and keeps repeating.
[08:43:47] <Cade> every time you call it, it gives you the next one in the series, or the first one if you've hit the end of the array.

[09:13:23] <icfantv> can someone help me with a .clone() question?
[09:14:06] <icfantv> specifically, is there a "proper" way to fix elements with "id" attributes?
[09:14:23] <icfantv> after cloning but before adding to the dom
[09:16:04] <icfantv> anyone?
[09:17:21] <Eviltwin> icfantv: Remove the IDs?
[09:17:47] <Eviltwin> If you still need IDs on them, you need to come up with your own scheme for deciding what they are
[09:17:49] <DaveJ|UK> Is there a selector for not in class?
[09:17:53] <DaveJ|UK> or attribute does not contain
[09:18:06] <aaronmcadam> ?not @ DaveJ|UK
[09:18:07] <bot-t> DaveJ|UK, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[09:18:21] <DaveJ|UK> ah thats cool

[09:18:48] <aaronmcadam> but should be ok
[09:19:13] <icfantv> the block level element i'm cloning has checkboxes w/ labels and unfortunately labels require that their targets have IDs for them to work.
[09:19:26] <icfantv> i just didn't know if there was a proper way to fix the IDs when cloning
[09:19:40] <aaronmcadam> sphinxxx: respond.js?
[09:19:49] <aaronmcadam> or whatever it's called
[09:20:25] <aaronmcadam> icfantv: do u have to clone them?
[09:20:35] <icfantv> no, but i was hoping to avoid duplicate HTML
[09:20:36] <aaronmcadam> icfantv: will js templating not do the same thing?
[09:20:57] <icfantv> aaronmcadam:  i've not heard of js templating, what is it?
[09:21:01] <aaronmcadam> you could pass something to the templater to make them unique

[09:45:40] <m4xx> What am I doing wrong? the _create method never get's called, _init works just fine :    http://jsfiddle.net/upDvP/6/
[09:47:07] <feathersanddown> uhm, is always needed an anonymous function to work ?? i've nested named function inside another anonym function
[09:47:23] <feathersanddown> and it doesn't execute, only bind =)

[09:50:10] <halcyon1234> m4xx: This is just an example. I'm trying to do other things that may/may not prevent default based on if the radio is checked (and other factors). But the first radio clicked checks itself, and then runs the click handler.
[09:50:32] <halcyon1234> m4xx: In all other cases, the click handler runs before the browser switches the selected radio button.

[09:57:11] <context> dogarrhea2: did you read the docs?
[09:57:15] <jedimind> dogarrhea2, well i mean, i could go there and read the documentation for you ...
[09:57:20] <jedimind> but id have to bill you for my time
[09:57:21] <dogarrhea2> i have read it.
[09:57:30] <m4xx> can you do it out loud so i can hear it too?
[09:57:31] <context> funny.
[09:57:34] <dogarrhea2> but anyways i experimented a bit and now i can do value: 2
[09:57:41] <context> took my about 5 seconds to find it
[09:57:47] <jedimind> lol
[09:58:05] <context> i didnt even have to click the arrow for what 'options: value' meant
[09:58:41] <context> dogarrhea2: jquery has some of the friendliest docs over other js libraries

[09:59:34] <halcyon1234> Weird. Updated the fiddle with an Alert. If I click a Radio, it switches. Then e.preventDefault() happens. Then the click handler exists, and *THEN* the radio button revents back to the originally selected button.

[10:00:49] <dogarrhea2> the data 2 argument vs 3 argument

[10:02:28] <danzik171> sphinxxx: Yes.
[10:02:30] <dogarrhea2> i always encounter this kinds of "doesn't behave how i'd expect" kind of things... when i make something draggable, it automatically turns the position relative and will ignore css position:absolute
[10:03:30] <dogarrhea2> but the doc doesn't say "call css("position":"absolute") on this after u create it even if you have css, because it will overwrite the value before it's added to the DOM and then continue to ignore your css after it's added to the dom"
[10:06:57] <Aquaguy> is there any way to extend an object adding some new methods to it
[10:07:39] <Aquaguy> for example, I've defined $.alert() is there any way to define $.confirm() and make that confirm method be a extended 'version' of the alert?

[10:10:49] <meinmkv> tried using $parseJSON but i get the same result.
[10:11:11] <danzik171> meinmkv: use dataType: 'json' in your ajax call

[10:29:58] <Cade> can someone explain to me how to pass parameters into a callback function?
[10:31:06] <dp> reading up on sortable, it suggests using sortable("serialize") for form submissions as well. is there an example of using this method with a form submit?
[10:39:15] <Cade> how do you pass parameters into the callback of a timer function when the values will change by the time the code gets run?
[10:43:12] <NickWebHA> I always do timers like this: setInterval(function() { /* code */ }, 1000 / ticks_main); or just include the name of an existing function. This way the function can get "fresh" data each time it is run.
[10:43:57] <NickWebHA> Obviously your time parameter does not have to be 1000 / ticks_main.
[10:44:48] <superjacaman> hey guys anyone know any font face generator like font squirrell?
[10:45:20] <danzik171> Cade: make a function that accepts your value(s) and returns a new function that'll be used in the timer
[10:45:44] <Cade> so you use the regular javascript timer, not one of the jquery timer plugins?
[10:46:32] * muzone is now playing: http://soundcloud.com/user4438121/angel-reflections-d-m-funk
[10:46:43] <Cade> There are going to be a LOT of timers here, like a few hundred, and I'd like to associate each of them with an element.
[10:47:09] <NickWebHA> Can anyone tell me why http://jsfiddle.net/47BwE/ is having an issue with pulling the data out of data() later in my code? Setting data("clean") seems to remove data("tile_h/tile_h"). I am using the latest version of jQuery.
[10:47:50] <Cade> danzik, can you show me an example?
[10:48:14] <Cade> I don't do that much javascript. I'm mainly server-side.
[10:48:35] <danzik171> Cade: make a reduced example on ?jsfiddle and i'll do it real quick
[10:49:21] <gnarf> Cade: um
[10:49:33] <gnarf> Cade: can you please restate the question for me?
[10:50:10] <gnarf> NickWebHA: also, setInterval isn't very "best-practice" anymore
[10:50:12] <gnarf> ?setInterval
[10:50:12] <bot-t> http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[10:50:42] <Cade> It's missing the timer plugin here http://jsfiddle.net/8A94s/
[10:51:00] <gnarf> Cade: what are you trying to acheive?
[10:51:25] <NickWebHA> gnarf: No? I just picked up JavaScript again after a few years. What is the norm now?
[10:51:36] <gnarf> Cade: cuz it seems to me like you should probably just be using an animation callback
[10:51:41] <gnarf> ?setInterval NickWebHA
[10:51:42] <bot-t> gnarf, Couldn't find "setInterval NickWebHA" in jQuery Docs.
[10:52:05] <gnarf> ?setInterval @NickWebHA
[10:52:05] <bot-t> NickWebHA, http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[10:52:23] <NickWebHA> I will check that out. Thanks
[10:52:23] <NickWebHA> .
[10:52:32] <Cade> I'm going to have an image on the page. The image will fade away from right to left, like a transparency gradient, revealing another picture underneath. a few seconds later, it will happen again, and the cycle of images will keep repeating.
[10:53:06] <gnarf> Cade: definitely sounds like you need an animation callback with a timeout
[10:53:13] <gnarf> or even .delay()
[10:53:30] <gnarf> you can do something like elem.fadeIn( 1000 ).delay( 2000 ).queue( nextSlide )
[10:53:32] <Cade> animation will only fade the whole thing at once, not right to left.
[10:53:50] <gnarf> Cade: you can do whatever fancy animation you want
[10:53:51] <Cade> I was originally using delay. Someone here told me to use a timer function.
[10:54:01] <danzik171> Cade: gnarf is probably right about the animation callback, but just for your knowledge: http://jsfiddle.net/8A94s/1/
[10:54:25] <Cade> Fine. How do I do a moving transparency gradient with .animate()?
[10:54:46] <gnarf> Cade: how were you plan on doing it without animate?
[10:55:08] <NickWebHA> gnarf: Yeah, I have done that a few times in previous projects. I implemented all the same fail safes with setInterval() with minimal code. I could imagine a case for either way.
[10:55:29] <Cade> By splitting the image up into a bunch of divs and fadeOut()ing each of them seperately.
[10:56:00] <gnarf> Cade: http://gfyackle.com/js/slideshow.js
[10:56:06] <Cade> no, animate(). Yes, I am using animate. But it needs to be on a delay
[10:56:20] <gnarf> Cade: there is actually a demo...
[10:56:22] * gnarf hunts
[10:57:00] <gnarf> Cade: check out blockfade: http://gnarf.net/jquery-ui/tests/visual/effects.all.html
[10:57:06] <NickWebHA> Is there anything special I should know about data()? Setting data a second time seems to erase the first set in the latest version.
[10:57:14] <gnarf> Cade: so what you're asking is possible
[10:57:31] <gnarf> Cade: but even then, that just makes your "fade" function more complex
[10:57:42] <gnarf> you'd do something like
[10:58:01] <ProLoser|Work> hey gnarf
[10:58:04] <ProLoser|Work> checkout this awesome shit i wrote
[10:58:14] <ProLoser|Work> deferreds + caching: http://jsfiddle.net/a4GVA/3/
[10:58:36] <gnarf> for( var i=0;i<parts.length;i++ ) { parts.eq(i).delay( i * 100).fadeOut(500); }
[10:59:11] <Cade> This http://gfyackle.com/js/slideshow.js isn't the whole thing, is it?
[10:59:39] <gnarf> Cade: yeah, it is
[10:59:49] <gnarf> Cade: it doesn't do the blockfade stuff
[10:59:58] <gnarf> but thats just a simple "sildeshow"
[11:00:08] <gnarf> does the main slideshow on http://gfyackle.com/
[11:00:09] <Cade> so how do I do the blockfade?
[11:00:15] <gnarf> your "advance" function
[11:00:55] <gnarf> Cade: the code for those split effects is pretty abstracted
[11:01:52] <gnarf> but you can probably steal this function https://github.com/lindstroem/jquery-ui/blob/split/ui/jquery.effects.split.js#L110-170

[11:05:27] <Cade> My function creates a bunch of divs inside the main div, each of which will display one sliver of the image. is that what you're talking about?
[11:05:49] <Ogredude> ngharo:  yep!  But looking closer it looks like it's loading jquery ui twice
[11:07:46] <gnarf> Cade: "pieces"
[11:08:48] <Ogredude> ngharo:  okay nevermind, I misread it, one of those is the jquery ui css
[11:10:01] <Ogredude> https://gist.github.com/1282043 <-- There's the scripts that are being included.
[11:10:39] <ngharo> link to live page?
[11:10:52] <Cade> gnarf, yes?
[11:11:23] <afeijo> how to reload the whole page if my js is running inside a modal box (fancybox) ? location.reload() wont work
[11:11:41] <Ogredude> ngharo:  let me get you a login
[11:12:32] <ngharo> afeijo: should work unless there is a frame involved
[11:12:38] <afeijo> yes, iframe
[11:12:41] <afeijo> but, I just found something
[11:12:44] <afeijo> from fancybox itself, testing
[11:13:03] <ngharo> parent.location.reload() might work
[11:13:34] <Ogredude> ngharo:  PM
[11:14:00] <Cade> gnarf?
[11:14:32] <afeijo> ngharo, thanks!!!
[11:15:36] <gnarf> Cade: gotta run afk for ~30 minutes
[11:15:38] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/rKrHu/ is where i got
[11:15:43] <gnarf> doesn't work
[11:15:47] <gnarf> for a reason im not too sure of yet
[11:15:53] <gnarf> but thats how i'd organize it i think
[11:29:23] <Cade> god damn it.
[11:32:03] <Ogredude> Cade:  I agree completely.
[11:35:27] <kenperkins> anyone know how to detect if width is set via css versus the browsers computed width?
[11:37:29] <starsinmypockets> This is strange.. I'm using jquery to generate a button, then I want trigger an event when that button is clicked, but it won't do it http://pastebin.com/apMnt7KY
[11:40:49] <ngharo> ?delegate @ starsinmypockets
[11:40:49] <bot-t> starsinmypockets, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:41:21] <ngharo> use delegate for your generated button click event
[11:42:02] <bfrog> if I need an element position in terms of the browser view window how would I get those?
[11:42:04] <ngharo> starsinmypockets: your code is binding click to an element that doesnt exist at runtime
[11:42:43] <ngharo> ?offset @ bfrog
[11:42:43] <bot-t> bfrog, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[11:42:47] <starsinmypockets> ngharo - got you... thanks
[11:43:27] <Krinkle> I used to think that $.getJSON automatically adds "callback=?" to the query string and uses a <script> tag â€“ if the request goes cross-domain.
[11:43:32] <Ogredude> ngharo:  I'm completely in the dark on the difference between .delegate and .live and how to decide which to use for any particular circumstance
[11:43:38] <Krinkle> however right now it appears not the case (1.6.4)
[11:43:43] <bfrog> is there a native dom function/property for that or is that done by jquery by recursing the dom tree
[11:44:03] <ngharo> Ogredude: don't worry about it too much.  1.7 has .on() to rule them all
[11:44:30] <Cade> Ogredude, I don't suppose you want to take a look http://jsfiddle.net/8QLwu/
[11:44:32] <Krinkle> ?on
[11:44:33] <bot-t> Krinkle, Selectors - Each action we perform with jQuery requires a target; for example, in order to hide or show an element on the page, first we must find that element. To do so, we rely on jQuerys selector expression... http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[11:44:54] <ngharo> on() - http://blog.jquery.com/2011/09/28/jquery-1-7-beta-1-released/
[11:44:55] <Cade> Ogredude, I don't suppose you want to take a look http://jsfiddle.net/8QLwu/ I corrected a couple errors and filled in the css that was on the guy's site.
[11:45:02] <Ogredude> ngharo:  neat!
[11:45:19] <Ogredude> Cade:  I'll look, but I can't promise anything...  I'm not very good at js yet
[11:46:21] <Ogredude> Cade:  well to start with, stick those images on the web somewhere and use the full links to them.  That fiddle's getting 404 on all the images.
[11:48:46] <Cade> I found some different images and put them in
[11:49:52] <gnarf> Cade: digging into it - got it kinda working
[11:49:54] <pensfan> anyone know what's wrong with my selector here?
[11:49:54] <pensfan> $("#prev ~ table > .extra").toggle();
[11:50:29] <pensfan> trying to get my older brother who is a table and all elements of that table with the class "extra"
[11:54:48] <Ogredude> Cade:  I think your markup is wrong, the script appears to be looking for a div and you don't have any.  Also, I don't see anything in there that actually starts the slideshow running.  Any reason for that particular slideshow script?  I've had good luck with http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ myself.
[12:00:09] <Cade> fuck. I originally had it as divs, then I saw that the css was all for ul/li. I changed it to a list, but forgot the part I changed in the javascript
[12:00:26] <Cade> Yeah. gnarf gave it to me
[12:01:23] <Cade> I want a slideshow where I can have a transparency gradient moving across the image from right to left.
[12:01:55] <Cade> I can modify that one to do that, but I need to get it working first
[12:02:29] <Cade> I changed it to "li" in the code but it still didn't work.
[12:03:30] <gnarf> Cade: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/HNZJV/3/
[12:03:33] <gnarf> thats where i'm ad now
[12:03:37] <gnarf> a little more functional
[12:04:41] <tcpsyn> Ok. I'm stuck. I'm working with some jquery ui tabs and trying to force a refresh. The only way I can get my content to refresh is to change the current tab with tabs('select') and then switch back. Am I missing something ridiculous?
[12:05:09] <tcpsyn> $("#"+clickedtab).tabs('select',current_tab);
[12:05:11] <Elephant> just use the load
[12:05:19] <Elephant> errr .load()
[12:05:29] <Elephant> and call it on the selected tab
[12:05:44] <tcpsyn> Elephant: load doesn't work at all. All my logic is in the select:
[12:05:46] <gnarf> Cade: might be a little more readable
[12:06:10] <Elephant> hrmmm, I don't have my code right in front of me. But I do just that.
[12:06:18] <tcpsyn> http://pastebin.com/aSNCzdsS
[12:06:27] <tcpsyn> that's how I've been doing my tabs.
[12:07:18] <Elephant> oh okay, yeah, it's not .load(), it's .tabs('load', $("#tabs").tabs("option","selected") )
[12:07:59] <gnarf> Cade: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/HNZJV/4/
[12:08:21] <gnarf> is that the effect you were looking for?
[12:09:10] <tcpsyn> Elephant: yea, doesn't do anything. $("#"+clickedtab).tabs('load',current_tab); .. nothing
[12:09:15] <tcpsyn> no error.. no change. nothing
[12:10:20] <gnarf> Cade: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/HNZJV/5/
[12:10:38] <electric_U> anyone ever use the jformer library?
[12:11:14] <Cade> Close enough that I can do the rest, but it doesn't work when I copy it over to my page.
[12:11:39] <Aquaguy> is there any way to make something like $('div#someDiv').close = function () { // doo something }
[12:11:40] <Aquaguy> ?
[12:11:55] <gnarf> Cade:  you can change the vars at the top http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/HNZJV/6/
[12:12:00] <tcpsyn> Elephant: ohhh. might be because my .button class is inside the loaded content
[12:12:01] <gnarf> Cade: use that one, just fixed a little bug
[12:12:15] <gnarf> Cade: change .slideshow / "li" in the code
[12:12:31] <gnarf> the only big thing in the css to care about is the fact that unless it has the .shown class its not shown
[12:12:53] <gnarf> Cade: removed some dead code: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/HNZJV/7/
[12:13:33] <tcpsyn> nope.. that's not it
[12:14:23] <Cade> I have the shown class on the first one and it still isn't showing up
[12:14:50] <Cade> oh. wait
[12:17:09] <Cade> I'm not using img tags in my own code, I'm using background images, so the hight and width needed to be on the li.
[12:18:01] <Cade> It's progressing through the images, but it's just snapping from one to the next, and after it goes through all of them the last one disappears and the page just stays white.
[12:18:19] <tcpsyn> Ok, So I can select a different tab, but not the same one.
[12:18:25] <tcpsyn> and load does absolutely nothing
[12:19:29] <gnarf> Cade: needs a .show() before the .addClass('shown')
[12:19:30] <Aquaguy> is there any way to make something like $('div#someDiv').close = function () { // doo something } ??
[12:19:33] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/HNZJV/9/
[12:20:19] <dabear>  Aquaguy, you mean make a function that can be reused. then yes. $.fn.close = function(){  /* do something*/}
[12:21:18] <Aquaguy> dabear, I want it to be for that element only, I dont want to reuse ir for other elements
[12:21:31] <gnarf> Cade: as far as flashing from one to the next goes, sounds like something isn't working in the piecer
[12:21:37] <gnarf> you might have to debug that one on your own
[12:21:47] <gnarf> cuz the fiddle obviously works
[12:21:54] <Cade> It was working fine in jsfiddle
[12:22:18] <gnarf> Cade: i think i know what it might be
[12:22:24] <gnarf> you said you needed to add width/height
[12:22:28] <gnarf> to the li
[12:22:44] <gnarf> if that was done in the ul.slideshow li.shown it wont carry over in the "pieced" version
[12:22:54] <gnarf> the "pieced" version is not inside ul.slideshow
[12:22:59] <gnarf> its just in a div sitting in the main body
[12:23:28] <Cade> I added it in the css
[12:23:58] <m4xx> I've gotten my first widget almost done. My selector is '#my_table .table_row'. in my widget, in my click events this.element always refers to the first .table_row in #my_table. i'de like it to return the .table_row that was 'clicked'
[12:23:58] <gnarf> Cade: what i mean to say is that "ul.slideshow li.shown"  wont match the "clone"
[12:24:11] <gnarf> Cade: so you might need to just do li.shown { width;height; }
[12:24:15] <DualDetroit> Help. :(
[12:24:33] <dabear> Aquaguy: no, if you do $('div') two times, you don't get the same object. you get two different jquery objects
[12:24:43] <bobbytek> How can I map an array of arrays to an array of arrays easily?
[12:24:48] <Cade> right. I see it
[12:24:55] <bobbytek> jQuery.map seems to flatten the structure
[12:24:55] <dabear> Aquaguy: see http://jsfiddle.net/NvjCp/
[12:25:07] <gnarf> Aquaguy: $("#somediv").data("close", function() {});.... $("#somediv").data().close();
[12:25:17] * DualDetroit has 42 million Javascript and CSS files to load in now that DualDetroit has a million plugins and 7 frameworks. ;-(
[12:25:21] <bobbytek> ah, I think I see how
[12:25:37] <gnarf> bobbytek: its tricky, but you can return an array containing an array
[12:25:44] <gnarf> and it gets "flattened" to an array
[12:25:47] <bobbytek> ya
[12:25:49] <bobbytek> saw that
[12:25:51] <bobbytek> thanks!
[12:25:58] <Cade> But the pieces that are being created outside the ul have their own height and width hardcoded
[12:26:12] <gnarf> ?js $.map( [[1],[2],[3]], function( elem ) { return [ elem ]; });
[12:26:13] <bot-t> gnarf: [[1], [2], [3]]
[12:26:19] <Cade> Both the outer one and the inner ones
[12:26:23] <gnarf> ?js $.map( [[1],[2],[3]], function( elem ) { return [ elem[0], elem[0]*2 ]; });
[12:26:24] <bot-t> gnarf: [1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6]
[12:26:27] <cruxst> DualDetroit: contactenate the shit out of those and use requirejs or equivalent
[12:26:35] <gnarf> ?js $.map( [[1],[2],[3]], function( elem ) { return [[ elem[0], elem[0]*2 ]]; });
[12:26:36] <bot-t> gnarf: [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6]]
[12:26:45] * DualDetroit has too many javascripts in da house.
[12:26:47] <gnarf> Cade: does that make sense?
[12:27:06] <gnarf> bobbytek: ^^^ those three examples make some sense?
[12:27:19] <DualDetroit> cruxst: How do I concatenate them if I ever want to change them? I don't want to be editing one big JS file
[12:27:51] <gnarf> Cade: the divs that contain them do, but the li itself doesn't
[12:27:56] <cruxst> DualDetroit: generally you wanna do it when you deploy
[12:28:07] <cruxst> DualDetroit: using an automated build tool
[12:28:27] <rayvan> DualDetroit++
[12:28:37] <cruxst> DualDetroit: or at least a server-side concatenation library such as Rails' Sprockets
[12:29:08] <gnarf> preferably minifiied and gzipped too :)
[12:29:11] <cruxst> Asset Management of some sort
[12:29:15] <DualDetroit> rayvan: Motown madness, yeah!!!
[12:29:26] <cruxst> gnarf: gzipped is enough, minified + gzipped = overkill
[12:29:30] * DualDetroit doesn't have Rails
[12:29:39] <Cade> I took the height and width from ul.slideshow and an added them to ul.slideshow li
[12:29:46] <cruxst> DualDetroit: what do you have? there are options for everyone!
[12:30:18] <Cade> What should I have done?
[12:30:20] <DualDetroit> cruxst: I could run a Python CGI script that concatenates the files
[12:30:37] <cruxst> DualDetroit: bingo, dont forget to cache the result
[12:30:50] <bobbytek> gnarf, yep, thanks again :)
[12:31:19] <gnarf> Cade: its not contained in the ul.slideshow anymore
[12:32:07] <gnarf> Cade: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/HNZJV/10/
[12:32:21] <gnarf> made the container have a class "slideshow-container"
[12:32:24] <gnarf> so you can target those now
[12:32:36] <gnarf> .slideshow-container li, .slideshow li
[12:32:39] <gnarf> or something
[12:34:30] <Cade> It works!
[12:34:32] <tcpsyn> this is really weird.
[12:34:35] <Cade> Awesome!
[12:34:42] <Cade> Thanks, both of you
[12:34:56] <orolo> i have a ajax data return of  {"5": "foo", "2" : "bar" }; when i access it via data.row[0] and .each(), it comes out alphabetical where 2 and 5 are reversed. how do i stop that?
[12:38:50] <orolo> here's a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/zpTFR/1/
[12:49:47] <michael_mbp> hi
[12:50:24] <eddiemonge> hi
[12:50:41] <michael_mbp> I want to do something like $("#"+file.id).add("div").addClass("meta").add("ul").add("li").html(json_response.meta) << instead I want to update various bits of my json response to multiple li's
[12:50:44] <michael_mbp> ideas?
[12:52:43] <falieson> does anyone have a script or can link me to one that will expand all accordions when a visitor press ctrl+f
[12:53:28] <michael_mbp> that'll disable browser find though?
[12:54:44] <yakko> falieson it's quite easy to do
[12:57:36] <pensfan> how do i get the previous sibling of "this"
[12:57:48] <pensfan> gaaaah
[12:58:10] <eddiemonge> $(this).prev()
[12:58:17] <eddiemonge> usually
[12:58:34] <ravenzz> any idea why the focus/blur doesn't get fired here http://79.27.105.180:8080/beta/
[12:58:35] <ravenzz> ?
[12:58:56] <ravenzz> use the tab to navigate
[13:00:06] <yakko> ravenzz $('.name, .twitter, .www, .email').bind('mouseenter focus', highlight).bind('mouseleave blur', init);
[13:00:16] <ravenzz> what?
[13:00:20] <m4xx> Can someone give me some input on how i could properly get the last clicked item? http://jsfiddle.net/QYn9Z/2/
[13:00:26] <yakko> ravenzz use the $('sel').live('blur', fn); command instead
[13:00:32] <ravenzz> why live?
[13:00:38] <yakko> ravenzz live istead of bind
[13:01:04] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: maybe because those elements dont have a focus?
[13:01:06] <yakko> live will support events on html that has been added after the loading of the page, like ajax
[13:01:49] <pensfan> anyone have any idea why this isn't toggling the rows that have a class of "table_extra_row" $(this).prev('table > .table_extra_row').toggle();
[13:01:51] <ravenzz> yakko that elements are not added by ajax or something
[13:01:59] <yakko> li, span and p elements don't haven focus event, <a> has
[13:02:02] <yakko> eddiemonge +1
[13:02:06] <kenperkins> has anyone written a jquery plugin or similar for interacting with document.styleSheets?
[13:02:13] <ravenzz> eddiemonge what?
[13:02:29] <pensfan> eddiemonge, k it isn't that then ... $(this).prev('table > .table_extra_row').toggle(); isn't selecting rows of that table with that class then
[13:02:30] <falieson> yakko: really? how's that
[13:02:49] <ravenzz> eddiemonge, yakko infact the focus is for the navigation
[13:03:13] <ravenzz> should I remove the other elements?
[13:03:24] <eddiemonge> pensfan: $(this).prev('table').children('.table_Extra')
[13:03:42] <pensfan> eddiemonge, why doesn't it allow me to do it the other way?
[13:03:48] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: they are responding to the mouseover, not to focus and blur. focus and blur apply to inputs
[13:03:53] <ravenzz> also it is strange that it works with live
[13:04:01] <eddiemonge> pensfan: because you are trying to do selections in a selection
[13:04:11] <pensfan> i thought it allowed that
[13:04:23] <ravenzz> eddiemonge not to links?
[13:04:35] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/VuKjH/1/
[13:04:51] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: not links either
[13:05:55] <ravenzz> uhm but you can select focused links in CSS
[13:06:02] <ravenzz> a:focus { /* foo */ }
[13:06:06] <antihero> If i have a div that's 100% wide, 20% height, and fixed position 80% from the top, how would I have it animate to "slide in" from the bottom?
[13:06:34] <ravenzz> eddiemonge also I would to know why it work with live()
[13:06:35] <falieson> yakko: reall, how's that?
[13:07:10] <yakko> ravenzz you can get a full list of supported elements here http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/blurfocus.html
[13:07:48] <yakko> ravenzz BIND will interact with the real native event dispatching from HTML/JAVASCRIPT
[13:07:50] <ravenzz> yep
[13:08:09] <yakko> ravenzz whereas LIVE will put jquery to simulate these events for you ;)
[13:08:39] <ravenzz> i see
[13:08:44] <ravenzz> that's weird
[13:08:47] <ravenzz> but ok
[13:08:47] <yakko> it's actually very easy
[13:08:53] <yakko> always use live()
[13:09:00] <falieson> does anyone have a script or can link me to one that will expand all accordions when a visitor press ctrl+f
[13:09:10] <yakko> don't use $('a#aa').click(), always use live
[13:09:10] <pensfan> eddiemonge, http://pastie.org/2684960 still not working
[13:09:18] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ pensfan
[13:09:19] <bot-t> pensfan, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[13:09:20] <_zoggy_> i hear its better to use delegate and not live
[13:09:33] <eddiemonge> dont use $('a#aa') either. use $('#aa')
[13:09:35] <_zoggy_> unless you need to chain events
[13:09:40] <saimon69> hello there
[13:09:43] <eddiemonge> _zoggy_: it is
[13:09:54] <ravenzz> yep I am not that noob
[13:09:56] <ravenzz> ty
[13:09:59] <ravenzz> guys
[13:10:00] <saimon69> can i manipulate a select tag in a hidden layer with jquery 1.4.3?
[13:10:12] <antihero> how would I get a scrollable div to scroll to a location?
[13:10:20] <yakko> eddiemonge selectors were not the scope of the question
[13:11:12] <yakko> eddiemonge but I just learned a new one, it likely IS FASTER to have less descriptive selectors
[13:11:36] <pensfan> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/cQdAj/
[13:12:32] <eddiemonge> yakko: $('#aa') maps to doc.getelebyid where $('a#aa') goes through regex first
[13:13:01] <_zoggy_> a#aa is bad as it has to search every a for #aa rather than just search for #aa
[13:13:31] <ravenzz> eddiemonge anyway as quirksmode say Links have focus
[13:13:59] <falieson> anyideas how I can make all accordion elements expand when ctrl+f is pressed?
[13:14:18] <_zoggy_> listen for key press for that combination, then do your action
[13:14:52] <_zoggy_> tons of plugins out there for hotkey binding too
[13:15:49] <eddiemonge> pensfan: you need to use .find() instead of .children() as you arent looking for immediate descendants
[13:15:57] <pensfan> okay
[13:15:58] <pensfan> thank you
[13:16:08] <pensfan> i actually knew that back in the day
[13:16:12] <pensfan> just getting back in
[13:17:02] <falieson> _zoggy_: I'm actually doing a lot of googling and I can't find a code snippet which realy works for what I'm trying to do, then again I don't under jS great
[13:17:54] <_zoggy_> falieson, just go to google and search for jquery hotkey plugin
[13:18:01] <_zoggy_> jquery lint: Selectors should be as specific as possible, not overqualified and never "class only"
[13:18:15] <_zoggy_> not sure i agree with never 'class only'
[13:18:29] <ch3mical> Why not?
[13:19:45] <eddiemonge> _zoggy_: what is that from?
[13:20:08] <_zoggy_> from http://firequery.binaryage.com/ jqlint
[13:20:53] <_zoggy_> https://github.com/jamespadolsey/jQuery-Lint
[13:21:01] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: focus works with bind on link tags: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/VuKjH/2/
[13:21:06] <eddiemonge> no live required
[13:22:02] <eddiemonge> _zoggy_: yeah class only is fine
[13:22:27] <jbrokc_> can hasClass take multiple classes?
[13:23:00] <snover> ?tias @ jbrokc_
[13:23:01] <bot-t> jbrokc_, Try It And See
[13:23:01] <ravenzz> eddiemonge so it should work with bind('focus') as well!?
[13:23:07] <snover> or read the api documentation
[13:23:10] <snover> one or the other
[13:23:24] <_zoggy_> ?hasClass
[13:23:25] <bot-t> .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[13:23:29] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: yes. try it in that example
[13:23:46] <jbrokc_> _zoggy_ & snover looks like no
[13:24:05] <ravenzz> eddiemonge that's weird. Because it doesn't here :[ I mean..that was my original solution
[13:24:10] <_zoggy_> i would think no since its called hasClass not hasClasses
[13:24:16] <eddiemonge> jbrokc_: can you see the comments on that page?
[13:24:24] <ravenzz> eddiemonge with live() it works :\
[13:24:32] <jbrokc_> eddiemonge: i switched to .is()
[13:24:35] <ravenzz> would you take a look at it again?
[13:24:38] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: then there is something else going on. are you adding the elements after calling that code?
[13:24:49] <ravenzz> no
[13:24:58] <ravenzz> no ajax or dom manipulation
[13:27:19] <ravenzz> eddiemonge http://79.27.105.180:8080/beta/
[13:28:09] <eddiemonge> ravenzz: because you are calling the focus on the paragraph and not the link
[13:28:17] <ravenzz> ...
[13:28:24] <CannedCorn> can you not animate a textarea?
[13:29:03] <ravenzz> eddiemonge look at the #header
[13:29:25] <ravenzz> I have an unordered list
[13:30:16] <jedimind> congratulations
[13:30:21] <jedimind> i have an ordered list
[13:30:23] <jedimind> i win
[13:30:37] <CannedCorn> hrm
[13:30:48] <ravenzz> \o/
[13:30:57] <CannedCorn> does it not work if you call animate on a focus
[13:31:28] <Guidewire> anyone here familiar with Easel.js?
[13:33:04] <ravenzz> eddiemonge well, I am tired and I make stupid errors
[13:33:25] <ravenzz> I am binding focus on each LI
[13:33:31] <eddiemonge> seems overly complicated
[13:33:42] <ravenzz> no to the links
[13:34:37] <monstaRtruck> hey
[13:34:57] <monstaRtruck> is it possible to select 2 classes like $('.this .that')
[13:35:12] <monstaRtruck> where class="this that"
[13:36:59] <dabear> monstaRtruck: how would you do that in css?
[13:37:01] <monstaRtruck> got it thx its .this.that
[13:37:15] <monstaRtruck> its for things likethis:
[13:37:30] <monstaRtruck> class="nicecheckbox $row->id"
[13:37:47] <monstaRtruck> while im applying a class
[13:37:48] <dabear> do you have an uglycheckbox as well?
[13:37:51] <monstaRtruck> i am search by class id
[13:38:11] <monstaRtruck> uglycheckbox?
[13:38:34] <dabear> yep
[13:38:37] <monstaRtruck> why
[13:38:42] <dabear> I see you have a nicecheckbox
[13:38:48] <monstaRtruck> oh
[13:38:51] <monstaRtruck> just an example
[13:39:01] <monstaRtruck> i thot u meant my method was bad
[13:39:19] <monstaRtruck> which is pretty leet
[13:39:41] <monstaRtruck> btw opposite of nice is rude
[13:39:43] <dabear> well, you seem to be generating a unique set of two classes for each checkbox?
[13:39:52] <monstaRtruck> actualy its mean
[13:39:56] <monstaRtruck> nice != mean
[13:39:56] <dabear> e.g. nicecheckbox_foo1 ?
[13:39:58] <monstaRtruck> not ugly
[13:40:04] <dabear> why not use an id instead?
[13:40:05] <monstaRtruck> ugly != pretty
[13:40:14] <dabear> #foobar_baz1
[13:40:20] <monstaRtruck> sorry im past that kind of iding garbage
[13:40:30] <monstaRtruck> and underscoring lol
[13:40:35] <monstaRtruck> thats why we have jQ
[13:40:41] <dabear> what
[13:40:44] <dabear> wat
[13:40:51] <monstaRtruck> lol_id sounds more like old js
[13:41:07] <dabear> how is that related to js at all?
[13:41:22] <dabear> this is a class name / id of an html element
[13:41:29] <monstaRtruck> ok and how would u select ur checkbox with 1 line
[13:41:43] <dabear> if you need to uniquely identify a checkbox, use an id
[13:41:46] <dabear> not a class
[13:41:52] <ajpiano> monstaRtruck: it's the same as in css
[13:41:55] <ajpiano> $(".foo.bar")
[13:42:06] <monstaRtruck> i kno aj already done thx
[13:42:20] <monstaRtruck> dabear is trying to send me back to 1999
[13:42:36] <monstaRtruck> dabear gime ur code
[13:42:39] <dabear> monstaRtruck: lol, so you are seriously avoiding using underscores in a jquery selector, because it reminds you of old js?
[13:43:01] <monstaRtruck> $('#id .class')?
[13:43:41] <dabear> what is the problem, though?
[13:43:48] * dabear dont get it
[13:43:48] <monstaRtruck> anyways today is wed oct 2011
[13:44:03] <monstaRtruck> first the prob is done its selecting
[13:44:08] <monstaRtruck> the prob is this:
[13:44:19] <monstaRtruck> many checkboxes with a class
[13:44:49] <monstaRtruck> <input class="c $id">
[13:45:10] <monstaRtruck> to select i use $('.c.$id')
[13:45:14] <dabear> why cant you have <input id="$id" ?>
[13:45:23] <dabear> -?
[13:45:31] <monstaRtruck> well write me how ud select it
[13:45:47] <dabear> $("#$id")
[13:45:53] <khmer> oh hey look it's everything wrong with jquery right here
[13:45:55] <monstaRtruck> and if u had other elements
[13:46:02] <monstaRtruck> w the same id
[13:46:16] <dabear> monstaRtruck: do you know what id stands for?
[13:46:17] <monstaRtruck> ud do thisone_$id
[13:46:30] <dabear> id=identificator
[13:46:32] <monstaRtruck> dabear im done talking to u now
[13:46:40] <dabear> you are not supposed to have multiple elements with the same id
[13:46:42] <monstaRtruck> stop being nerdy
[13:46:47] <khmer> lol
[13:46:59] <khmer> this guy writes jquery WHILE SKATEBOARDING
[13:47:02] <khmer> profiling is for CHUMPS
[13:47:11] <khmer> who don't use AXE BODY SPRAY for th'DATES!@!!
[13:47:19] <monstaRtruck> exactly khmer thx
[13:47:25] <monstaRtruck> we out
[13:47:29] <khmer> have you ever used jsperf bro
[13:47:34] <khmer> super hardcore bro
[13:48:02] <monstaRtruck> dabear i dont want to be rude
[13:48:11] <monstaRtruck> but im working on an SVG app
[13:48:31] <khmer> why that's outrageous
[13:48:44] <monstaRtruck> it has lots of checkboxes for each layer
[13:48:47] <monstaRtruck> with the same id
[13:48:55] <monstaRtruck> i think i kno what im doing
[13:49:07] <khmer> hahahaha
[13:49:18] <monstaRtruck> i could even wrap the whole layer in a parent div
[13:49:22] <khmer> you sure do, buddy, you sure do
[13:49:22] <monstaRtruck> and give that the id
[13:49:38] <dabear> you must be some kinda genious
[13:49:48] <dabear> worshipped be THOUSANDS
[13:49:50] <khmer> like i said: *while skateboarding*
[13:49:56] <khmer> upside down
[13:50:08] <monstaRtruck> dabear id like to see ur suggestions
[13:50:25] <dabear> oh, and Cookies
[13:50:26] <khmer> kickflip, $("#check-box.ckbx[xxtreme=true]").each()
[13:50:49] <monstaRtruck> exactly why i have to scrap your code
[13:51:08] <dabear> monstaRtruck: you haven't really asked anything I haven't answered. use an id #foo. or use .this.that
[13:51:41] <khmer> (function(eXtReMe_dO0d,t0t4l_l4m3r){ /* the universe */ }(me,u)
[13:51:42] <monstaRtruck> id wont work
[13:51:47] <khmer> )
[13:51:48] <ajpiano> monstaRtruck: typically when you have many like elements, and each has a distinct id, you end up with something like <input class="foo" id="foo-21" />
[13:52:22] <monstaRtruck> monstaRtruck> sorry im past that kind of iding garbage
[13:52:22] <monstaRtruck> <monstaRtruck> and underscoring lol
[13:52:22] <monstaRtruck> <monstaRtruck> thats why we have jQ
[13:52:38] <ajpiano> so do
[13:52:51] <monstaRtruck> $(".layercheckbox."+node.id+"").attr("checked", "checked");
[13:52:59] <monstaRtruck> this is what i did it works im done
[13:53:19] <khmer> i'm dying laughing here
[13:53:19] <monstaRtruck> i googled it before u could respond piano
[13:53:21] <monstaRtruck> so thx
[13:53:29] <ajpiano> monstaRtruck: what are you trying to prove, exactly.
[13:53:44] <monstaRtruck> that i dont want to use class-id
[13:53:53] <ajpiano> ok, we're all super stoked for you
[13:53:58] <ajpiano> selecting elements by ID is for suckers
[13:54:04] <monstaRtruck> yep
[13:54:05] <khmer> you should definitely put i on github
[13:54:25] <monstaRtruck> github is for nerds
[13:54:33] <khmer> oh sorry, deadjournal
[13:55:09] <kswedberg> selecting elements by ID is super slow! let's all select elements by multiple class names instead!
[13:55:37] <khmer> jquery has achieved its chief aim of obsoleteing the underscore
[13:55:37] <monstaRtruck> its the same
[13:55:49] <ajpiano> monstaRtruck: it's actually not even the same
[13:55:55] <khmer> monstaRtruck: seriously have you ever run jsperf or done a profiler or anything
[13:56:19] <monstaRtruck> well if u have 2 classes 1 of which is unique it is
[13:56:26] <ajpiano> no it isn't.
[13:56:41] <kswedberg> monstaRtruck: not. even. close.
[13:56:43] <khmer> he won't talk to me! is it because i'm a nerd
[13:57:23] <JohnnyDavidson> Does anyone know a site
[13:57:28] <monstaRtruck> ok id give ur code a look
[13:57:29] <JohnnyDavidson> where I can upload javascript files?
[13:57:30] <monstaRtruck> show me
[13:57:37] <vladikoff> JohnnyDavidson, Facebook
[13:57:49] <ajpiano> monstaRtruck: give me a minute
[13:57:50] <JohnnyDavidson> where on facebook?
[13:58:07] <linusoleander> Is it somehow possible to add a base domain to $.get, $.ajax and so on?
[13:58:07] <linusoleander> I want this line $.get("/random") to equal $.get("http://example.com:123/random");
[13:58:11] <smplstk> vladikoff: >:|
[13:58:14] <linusoleander> Is that possible somehow?
[13:58:20] <ajpiano> linusoleander: use an ajaxPrefilter
[13:58:27] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax
[13:58:55] <linusoleander> ajpiano: Perfect, thanks!
[14:00:08] <jedrek> I can't seem to get .scrollTop() to give me a real number for the scroll position of my iframe from within the iframe
[14:00:38] <smplstk> jedrek: is the content in the iframe from the same domain?
[14:00:49] <jedrek> nope
[14:01:03] <cesconix> Can i pass variable (var direction = 'left') in $(elemen).position().direction?
[14:01:04] <smplstk> you can't execute JS on a page with externally loaded content
[14:01:09] <miketaylr> ?sop
[14:01:09] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[14:01:18] <smplstk> ^^
[14:02:00] <jedrek> well, i'd like to get the position of my iframe from within that iframe, or would it's position be considered an attribute of the top element?
[14:02:03] <ajpiano> monstaRtruck: http://jsperf.com/id-vs-unique-class
[14:03:21] <khmer> DAMN ajpiano beat me
[14:03:33] <Remon_> Hey, does anyone have any experience with Google Apps?
[14:04:09] <monstaRtruck> i need many checkboxes of the same id tho
[14:05:12] <khmer> no, you don't
[14:05:21] <khmer> maybe you think you do, but you really mean the same name
[14:05:29] <ajpiano> monstaRtruck: it's woefully invalid to have elements with duplicate ids
[14:05:55] <ajpiano> monstaRtruck: it's perfectly reasonable for you to use classes in this circumstance if there are multiple elements that actually conform to that "class"
[14:06:11] <monstaRtruck> right
[14:06:19] <khmer> http://jsperf.com/jquery-class-selector-versus-id-selector <-- got the same result
[14:07:01] <khmer> 98% slower
[14:07:03] <monstaRtruck> of course searching for thisid is gona be faster than searching for an id in a set of ids
[14:07:11] <monstaRtruck> khmer i get it
[14:07:30] <monstaRtruck> one doesnt search while the other does
[14:07:43] <monstaRtruck> one selects
[14:07:47] <monstaRtruck> the other searches
[14:07:50] <monstaRtruck> durrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[14:07:51] <snover> you did get the part where having multiple identical IDs is invalid right?
[14:08:00] <khmer> i think you should definitely skateboard more and turn your hat to the side
[14:08:03] <khmer> it's been awesome chatting
[14:08:04] <monstaRtruck> snover stay out of this
[14:08:17] <khmer> don't steal ice creams from the convenience store and stay in school
[14:08:19] <khmer> cheers mates
[14:08:33] <monstaRtruck> khmer id like to see ur code
[14:08:35] <snover> Thanks for the offer, but no, I think I will involve myself in your discussion.
[14:08:53] <monstaRtruck> ok guys i actaully have a job to do
[14:10:22] <monstaRtruck> instead of giving everything a unique-this-stuff-here_id
[14:10:44] <monstaRtruck> so it can be a microsecond faster
[14:10:48] <ajpiano> we aren't saying you should give everything a unique id by any means if the elemnts aren't unique anyway
[14:11:11] <ajpiano> all we're saying is this whole "underscores are irrelevant and ids are bad" business isn't related to reality
[14:11:18] <monstaRtruck> ill save that kind of optimizing for my opengl engine
[14:12:28] <monstaRtruck> all im doing is utilizing jQ for its coolnes right piano?
[14:13:05] <ajpiano> i don't purport to know your motivations
[14:14:17] <monstaRtruck> khmer hates me bad
[14:14:20] <monstaRtruck> lol
[14:16:13] <ericlewis> what's the class variable for event to get the scroll direction from .scroll?
[14:18:04] * jedimind blinks
[14:28:22] <mobile> o
[14:31:56] <cruxst> someone should release a series of videos that explain how selector engine is built internally
[14:35:50] <monstaRtruck> here is a lil something
[14:35:51] <monstaRtruck> /æŒ‡é’ˆå›žé€€æŸ¥æ‰¾æ˜¯å¦æœ‰ç©ºæ ¼å¦‚æžœæœ‰åœ¨å€’æ•°ç¬¬ä¸€ä¸ªç©ºæ ¼å¤„æ¢è¡Œ
[14:35:51] <monstaRtruck> 					var spacePos = this.findSpace(txt,i,maxLine);
[14:35:54] <monstaRtruck> hmmm?
[14:48:34] <webdev5> for ui resizable can you resize other than right and down?
[14:50:14] <context> webdev5: with JS anything is possible
[14:50:40] <webdev5> ok how?
[14:51:07] <context> write an event handler when something is resized to modify its css properties for its positioning
[14:51:22] <context> hell you could probably do it with just css
[14:51:31] <webdev5> ok I'll try that, thanks context
[14:55:31] <webdev5> it's done with side: {top:true}
[15:00:39] <webdev5> handles: 'n, e, s, w'
[15:02:43] <Y_Ichiro`laptop> What would cause console.log "size is: " + $("#element").size
[15:02:59] <Y_Ichiro`laptop> to do
[15:03:01] <Y_Ichiro`laptop> size is: function () { return this.length; }
[15:03:37] <ajpiano> Y_Ichiro`laptop: the fact that you are not executing the function., instead you're referencing it
[15:03:45] <ajpiano> .size() or .length
[15:04:09] <Y_Ichiro`laptop> wow
[15:04:30] <Y_Ichiro`laptop> .size() and .size is the same thing in ruby lol
[15:04:36] <Y_Ichiro`laptop> totally did not see that
[15:05:03] <ajpiano> THIS. IS. JAVASCRIPT.
[15:05:04] <ajpiano> lol
[15:06:23] <patbam> hi everyone. i'm trying to figure out how to play a series of clips of an <audio> file: http://jsfiddle.net/snifty/KBdJ6/1/ i'm not sure how to queue it up
[15:08:49] <pvgrif> is there a way to change a property of a class in jquery
[15:09:21] <pvgrif> instead of selecting all the elements of that class
[15:09:39] <pvgrif> css class i mean
[15:10:46] <context> as far as i know you can add/remove classes. but not modify the class itself
[15:10:57] <ajpiano> pvgrif: see ?g jquery rule flesler
[15:10:58] <bot-t> pvgrif, Ariel Flesler: jQuery.Rule - http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html
[15:11:00] <context> would make it a living hell for debugging i imagine
[15:12:10] <pvgrif> ok thanks
[15:16:14] <linusoleander> Does the OPTIONS type exists? Like GET and POST
[15:22:41] <jodaro> hiya
[15:23:04] <jodaro> i'm trying to get navigation of a nested cycle slideshow working within each nested element
[15:23:28] <jodaro> seems to stop navigating to the next inner slide
[15:23:49] <jodaro> https://gist.github.com/1282833
[15:24:10] <jodaro> if anyone has experience and has a second to take a look i'd appreciate it
[15:34:38] <webdev5> how do you make a newly appended element draggable?
[15:35:53] <snover> how do i search documentation?
[15:38:15] <webdev5> such the wisecracker snover
[15:38:28] <webdev5> funny :)
[15:45:49] <Aristata1> how do I put a listener on a radio button for when it's selected/deselected
[15:49:29] <Aristata1> cool
[15:53:28] <JakeSays> hmm. is it not possible to post json to a server?
[15:54:16] <coldhead> it definitely is possible, JakeSays
[15:54:22] <coldhead> i do it every day
[15:54:24] <JakeSays> coldhead: thats what i thought
[15:55:03] <JakeSays> i set contentType='text/json', but the post data is form encoded
[15:55:53] <coldhead> can you create the JSON yourself and send it as a string?
[15:56:01] <coldhead> the browser doesn't know how to do it for you
[15:56:32] <JakeSays> ah so i stringify and send the text as the post data?
[15:56:34] <Brodingo> JSON't
[16:00:57] <juha_> coldhead: i need a bigger boat
[16:02:00] <JakeSays> coldhead: heh. that did the trick. thanks.
[16:05:55] <tommyvyo_> does anyone know the name of the plugin that resizes text to fit a div? like one line will be really big and the next will be small, etc
[16:06:00] <romankrv> Hi. What is different a $.get and http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ when one need to use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ but not $.get() ?
[16:06:04] <K1ng> how do i make var jq = jquery?
[16:06:11] <coldhead> juha_: don't we all
[16:06:16] <K1ng> without noConflict()
[16:07:37] <coldhead> did you try what you just wrote there?
[16:07:47] <coldhead> if you properly capitalize the Q it should work
[16:10:15] <juha_> if i ever get a bigger boat, i'm going to fill it with bananas
[16:10:33] <coldhead> i will not board this vessel
[16:12:25] <juha_> it's your loss
[16:12:26] <K1ng> thanks coldhead :D
[16:16:36] <coldhead> bananas make me uncomfortable
[16:16:43] <coldhead> they're the devil's fruit
[16:18:06] <juha_> but god designed them to be easily grabbed and opened, fits perfectly into your hand
[16:18:09] <juha_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGMuIyBK5P4
[16:18:33] <juha_> your mind will blow after that video
[16:24:52] <coldhead> this video changes everything
[16:25:01] <coldhead> i thought my iphone was well designed!
[16:25:12] <coldhead> but now it seems like a piece of crap
[16:25:19] <coldhead> NB I don't own an iphone
[16:26:47] <juha_> i hope that they would relese a banana phone
[16:27:08] <coldhead> talk to god about it
[16:27:21] <ProLoser|Work> hello
[16:27:21] <juha_> god would go bananas if i would
[16:31:00] <Xinil> using jquery 1.6.4, anyone think of a reason $('#id').data('status','test'); wouldn't work?
[16:31:34] <Xinil> $('#id').html('test'); does
[16:31:34] <coldhead> the ID does not exist?
[16:31:42] <coldhead> hmm!
[16:31:46] <Xinil> indeed
[16:31:54] <coldhead> in what sense doesn't it work?
[16:32:01] <coldhead> you can't later retrieve that data?
[16:32:03] <Xinil> firebug/chrome don't detect
[16:32:32] <Xinil> oh, interesting
[16:32:35] <coldhead> what if you say on the next line alert( $('#id').data('status') );
[16:32:47] <juha_> console.fucking.log
[16:32:49] <Xinil> it actually DOES change, but firebug/chrome don't show the change in web developer
[16:32:55] <coldhead> data() shouldn't be visible in the html
[16:33:01] <coldhead> it stores it magically
[16:33:06] <Xinil> i see
[16:33:06] <coldhead> it's not attr()
[16:33:10] <Xinil> thanks :)
[16:33:20] <coldhead> who debugs the debuggers etc
[16:33:25] <coldhead> good luck Xinil
[16:34:14] <juha_> Xinil: for future debuggins, try something like this: $("#id").data("lol", "monkeyballs"); console.log($("#id").data("lol"));
[16:34:58] <coldhead> he probably does, juha_
[16:35:04] <coldhead> i was the idiot talking about alert()
[16:35:25] <coldhead> sometimes i just don't have the energy to say "do you have firefox? open the console" etc
[16:35:33] <coldhead> then later i get coffee
[16:35:50] <juha_> that's just because you're afraid of the vengeful hand of bananagod
[16:36:21] <juha_> coldhead: i just assume that everyone knows about console
[16:37:00] <coldhead> you are a better man than me
[16:37:05] <coldhead> for i am a woman
[16:37:14] <coldhead> with beautiful flowing black hair
[16:37:21] <coldhead> like a toxic river
[16:37:30] <coldhead> running down my naked back
[16:38:58] <juha_> you're not allowed to wear any clothes or is it just a "down under thing" ?
[16:39:53] <coldhead> i have a terrible skin condition
[16:40:37] <juha_> well that explains... nothing
[16:41:32] <coldhead> one doctor described it as "like the consistency of oatmeal"
[16:42:20] <juha_> oatmeal the comic?
[16:42:28] <juha_> that's pretty sweet skin condition
[16:53:42] <tommyvyo_> ANYONE?!?!?! http://i.imgur.com/XIaWn.jpg
[16:55:09] <yakko> tommyvyo_ IDK, maybe cuffon may do it
[16:55:18] <tommyvyo_> i don't think so
[16:55:35] <tommyvyo_> i can remember the documentation looked like but google isn't bringing anything up other than TextFill()
[16:58:16] <tommyvyo_> .... problem solved :) http://www.zachleat.com/bigtext/demo/
[16:59:41] <mikesherov> gnarf, you here?
[17:07:58] <bobbytek2> less.js
[17:08:01] <bobbytek2> discuss
[17:09:24] <coldhead> i'm told it will obsolete css
[17:09:52] <warrenparsons> I use it. It comes in handy, but also comes with its own set of drawbacks.
[17:10:20] <coldhead> doesn't everything
[17:10:59] <devildue> ANSWER ME!
[17:11:12] <bobbytek2> warrenparsons, such as?
[17:11:22] <bobbytek2> What about built time less?
[17:11:37] <coldhead> i have no record of your question, devildue
[17:11:52] <coldhead> perhaps something has gone wrong
[17:12:04] <warrenparsons> bobbytek2: It reformats all CSS to multiline, potentially (definitely, in my case) making line number references in Firebug or Chrome Dev Tools useless.
[17:12:28] <warrenparsons> Kind of a pain.
[17:12:42] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: multiline? or do you mean single line?
[17:12:43] <mikesherov> yeah, but you can also use LESS server side to generate the relevant css
[17:12:56] <mikesherov> so you write in less, generate the css, and serve the css straight up
[17:13:07] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: I write 99% of my CSS as single line. Less outputs it as one rule per line.
[17:13:30] <mikesherov> it certainly won't obsolete CSS, but it may obsolete writing in straight up css
[17:13:46] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: eww. besides you should serve the unminified for dev and minified for production
[17:13:48] <mikesherov> same way as jQuery obsoleted a lot fo writing in vanilla javascript
[17:13:56] <warrenparsons> mikesherov: Its biggest benefits are variables and concatenation. I'm not sold on the functions.
[17:14:10] <mikesherov> variables and mixins
[17:14:18] <mikesherov> and shorthand is sweet
[17:14:38] <warrenparsons> I don't like the mixins. They obfuscate too much, and are pretty unnecessary if you're using OOCSS.
[17:14:53] <fridgeratorr> I am trying to use the uploadify plugin to upload files.  I am working locally, uploading the files to a folder in my home directory.  It is not working because I believe I have to set some permssions to the folder.  To what group or user would I give permissions to?
[17:15:20] <eddiemonge> fridgeratorr: you arent running a local web server?
[17:15:46] <mikesherov> Yeah, sure, but what nested rules
[17:15:47] <fridgeratorr> eddiemonge yeah i am
[17:15:48] <mikesherov> way clearer
[17:16:07] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: I'm not minifying anything on Dev. I just prefer to write rule sets with fewer than four or five rules on a single line. Less gets in the way of that.
[17:16:27] <eddiemonge> fridgeratorr: then you shouldnt have file permission errors unless you have it setup wrong
[17:16:32] <bobbytek2> Okay, so is less pretty popular or just starting to gain recognition?
[17:16:53] <snover> warrenparsons: no it doesnâ€™t.
[17:16:59] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: i think your code gets in the way. that becomes unreadable. use whitespace. its your friend
[17:17:13] <bobbytek2> devildue, please don't message me
[17:17:33] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: I think you're getting a little too hung up on my personal coding style preference in CSS.
[17:17:49] <necromancer> haha check out this funny ass picture http://i.imgur.com/XIaWn.jpg << pro click zone
[17:17:49] <snover> LESS is a superset of CSS, so if you wanna put 5 on a line, go for it
[17:17:53] <necromancer> it's so good
[17:17:56] <necromancer> you gotta love it
[17:17:59] <snover> Everyone you work will will hate you
[17:18:01] <snover> but you can totally do it
[17:18:05] <snover> with will*
[17:18:22] <warrenparsons> snover: The problem is that Less parses it to multline, making line numbers in browser tools useless.
[17:18:44] <bobbytek2> warrenparsons, why not use static less?
[17:19:09] <warrenparsons> bobbytek2: I'm not sure what you mean.
[17:19:21] <bobbytek2> generated server side
[17:19:26] <bobbytek2> less -> css
[17:19:40] <bobbytek2> for example, for grails you can use https://github.com/davidmarquis/grails-lesscss
[17:19:46] <warrenparsons> bobbytek2: The parsing is done server side, via Java.
[17:20:01] <snover> warrenparsons: but of course your line numbers would change anyway even if you didnâ€™t do that because the resulting CSS would not have the variable at-rules and things.
[17:20:11] <eddiemonge> via java? not ruby?
[17:20:20] <snover> pretty sure LESS is a JavaScript library guys.
[17:20:30] <snover> and by â€œpretty sureâ€ I mean â€œI use it regularlyâ€ :)
[17:20:31] <bobbytek2> via rhino (javascript enginer for java)
[17:20:43] <bobbytek2> *engine
[17:20:44] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: Yes, the sites I work on are mostly Java-based.
[17:21:26] <warrenparsons> snover: The line numbers are only changed because the Less engine only outputs as one rule per line.
[17:21:29] <abjorn> ew java :)
[17:21:42] <eddiemonge> abjorn: i didnt want to say but +1
[17:21:51] <abjorn> lol
[17:21:52] <snover> warrenparsons: and does not output mixins, and does not output variable at-rules, and does not output nested rules because of course that is impossibleâ€¦
[17:21:56] <bobbytek2> I should say java byte code
[17:22:08] <snover> If you are using *any* feature of LESS, the output is different
[17:22:12] <bobbytek2> I prefer groovy to java (and ruby for that matter)
[17:22:15] <snover> it is a preprocessor
[17:22:17] <snover> that is what preprocessors do
[17:22:18] <warrenparsons> snover: I don't use mixins or nested rules. Just the variables and concatenation feature (on Staging/Prod)
[17:22:39] <snover> warrenparsons: variable at-rules are not included in the output.
[17:22:49] <khmer> i'm suspicious of using less or sass in a production environment
[17:22:49] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: maybe its trying to tell you something ....
[17:22:53] <khmer> to me they are prototyping tools
[17:22:59] <khmer> and they don't necessarily generate fast or readable css
[17:23:07] <snover> ffs.
[17:23:17] <snover> the output is not *supposed* to be readable.
[17:23:23] <snover> and it is not an optimizer.
[17:23:30] <bobbytek2> It could be though
[17:23:33] <snover> if you write shitty CSS rules you will get shitty output
[17:24:06] <bartmax> if you write shitty ___ you will get shitty ___ (fill in the blanks with whatever you want)
[17:24:21] <khmer> well, not necessarily
[17:24:33] <bobbytek2> I really detest css for not adding at least some of less' features
[17:24:38] <bobbytek2> variables are key
[17:24:40] <snover> Because of the cascading nature of CSS and the inability of a CSS preprocessor to know what sort of document its output will be used with, it is basically impossible to perform any meaningful â€œoptimizationâ€ of CSS
[17:24:45] <khmer> you can write good less that will produce css with too highly stacked selectors
[17:25:04] <warrenparsons> snover: You're pretty much missing the point here: I write most of my CSS with all the rules on a single line. That way the selectors line up nicely at the left gutter, and my CSS files are far shorter in line count, making maintenance easier. My single problem with Less is its insistence on breaking the association between line numbers in the source file and those output to the browser.
[17:25:05] <snover> khmer: who cares? you, and nobody else. even the people that write css engines say it is the engineâ€™s job to optimize, not the author
[17:25:33] <khmer> snover: it's not much of an optimization, compared to JS or HTML optimizations, but CSS rendering is a significant part of pageload
[17:25:43] <snover> warrenparsons: and you are missing the point that you cannot use a preprocessor and get the same line outputs because the entire purpose of a preprocessor is to modify the inputâ€¦
[17:25:46] <khmer> snover: and, my sainted self cares, plus at least one other person
[17:25:57] <khmer> snover: one minute, i'm going to bring you the PAIN
[17:26:16] <khmer> snover: http://smacss.com/book/selectors
[17:26:17] <snover> warrenparsons: if you want identical output in the browser then never ever use a minifier or a preprocessor
[17:26:22] <warrenparsons> snover: Which is a pretty strong argument against using a preprocessor for something as simple as CSS.
[17:26:29] <snover> CSS is not simple.
[17:26:37] <warrenparsons> The syntax is very simple.
[17:26:40] <khmer> as he says, the delta between the best and worst cases is 50ms
[17:26:41] <bartmax> warrenparsons: I can't agree more.
[17:26:58] <snover> CSS is an endless pit of despair that will fuck you in the ass every time you create anything non-trivial with it
[17:27:04] <snover> because its specificity rules suck
[17:27:12] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: how is single line css maintenance easier?
[17:27:25] <bartmax> snover: looks like you need to learn a little bit more of, css IS simple... reaaalllly simple.
[17:27:42] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: All (most) selectors line up at the left gutter. Line count is much smaller so there's less scrolling.
[17:27:44] <bobbytek2> too simple
[17:27:46] <snover> bartmax: or you need to create something that is non-trivialâ€¦
[17:27:49] <bobbytek2> hence less
[17:27:52] <eddiemonge> bartmax: lol snover knows all
[17:28:04] <bartmax> eddiemonge: I use single line css and It's way better for maintenance
[17:28:11] <bartmax> snover: already did lots of non-trivial....
[17:28:17] <warrenparsons> snover: Specificity is much less of a problem if you take advantage of something like OOCSS.
[17:28:26] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: you should be scrolling anyway. search. line counts dont matter in dev
[17:28:36] <bartmax> snover: you can take a look at futbolea.com (it's like 3-4 years old, but youll get the point)
[17:28:38] <eddiemonge> *shouldnt
[17:28:57] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: Thanks for the advice, but I'm pretty happy with the way I write my CSS.
[17:29:19] <eddiemonge> bartmax: what is the point of that example?
[17:29:50] <bartmax> eddiemonge: wasn't for you, for snover asked me for something not-trivial... inside pages site are...
[17:30:12] * warrenparsons can't remember the last time he did something trivial in CSS.
[17:31:55] <eddiemonge> single line css makes finding the individual rules fucking hard while making the selectors easy to find. selectors are easy to find with a search, individual rules arent. so make it more readable for the individual rules and dont worry as much about arranging the selectors
[17:32:32] <snover> bartmax: Iâ€™ve decided I want all the links on the site to be underlined, except for the ones in a container with a class .foo which are used in random places throughout the site with no consistent parent structure. Oh, you canâ€™t do that, because you have used 9000 ID selectors.
[17:32:33] <snover> good job.
[17:33:07] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: When there are too many rules on one line, yes it can become "too fucking hard" to pick them out. Which is why I write *most* of my CSS singleline, you know, the vast majority of selectors with only a handful of rules? Past a certain threshold of readability, I break it into multiline.
[17:33:11] <bartmax> .foo {!important} ... pfff
[17:33:26] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: Seriously, this isn't a religion.
[17:33:38] <eddiemonge> it kind of is
[17:33:56] <snover> nâ€¦ot reallyâ€¦
[17:34:09] <eddiemonge> !important === vomit-in-my-mouth. should be avoided like ... well like vomit in mouth
[17:34:34] <bartmax> snover: and btw, it's a nightmare to maintain what you suggest... anyway i don't you to tell me what is good/bad :) lol
[17:34:36] <eddiemonge> snover: n-ot for me
[17:34:46] <snover> bartmax: and it is EXTREMELY COMMON
[17:34:50] <snover> and this is why CSS is not trivial
[17:34:52] <snover> and is a piece of shit
[17:34:55] <snover> sorry, not â€œsimpleâ€
[17:34:58] <bartmax> snover: you said css isn't simple, and for me, it's super dupper simple
[17:35:25] <snover> the fact that I just asked for a very common and straightforward thing and you had to resort to using !important shows pretty clearly that CSS is not simple
[17:35:50] <bartmax> snover: no, you just asked for a ver common and straightforward ANTIPATTERN i do not do/like
[17:35:57] <snover> if CSS was simple you would go â€œoh no problem! Iâ€™ll just add a rule with a specificity of :link+1â€
[17:36:00] <bartmax> if you do that, you need to take that consideration, i dont
[17:36:03] <bartmax> simple
[17:36:08] <bartmax> you can write css so many ways...
[17:36:10] <warrenparsons> snover: If you're using ID selectors for style in the first place, you're doing something wrong.
[17:36:11] <snover> bartmax: you do realise that is how every single widgeted system on the universe worksâ€¦right?
[17:36:20] <snover> warrenparsons: I agree with you 9000%.
[17:36:36] <snover> warrenparsons: bartmax is the one using them
[17:36:40] <warrenparsons> Ahh.
[17:36:41] <snover> and the one insisting that CSS is â€œsimpleâ€
[17:37:00] <K1ng> i have multiple forms with class "askq_id" and its contain a table.. how do i make click() work with all table on all forms
[17:37:03] <snover> ID selectors in CSS is like using a nuclear bomb to dig a hole
[17:37:13] <warrenparsons> snover: Using it isn't simple. It requires a lot of thought and seat time to get it mostly right. The syntax is very simple, though.
[17:37:15] <imsky> damn unpretty
[17:37:31] <eddiemonge> k1ng  $('askq_id').find('table')
[17:37:46] <snover> the fact that the syntax started out simple is part of the reason we are in this mess to begin with, I think.
[17:38:08] <snover> like html, itâ€™s a document styling language that has been repurposed into application styling
[17:38:12] <warrenparsons> snover: Granted. Variables should have been included from the beginning.
[17:38:14] <snover> and it sucks badly at it.
[17:38:16] <snover> very very badly.
[17:38:30] <snover> warrenparsons: bert bos ranted at length about how horrible an idea variables in css were
[17:38:50] <snover> he is one of the creators of css
[17:38:51] <snover> you do the math :)
[17:38:57] <imsky> lrn2css
[17:38:58] <warrenparsons> snover: He can rant all he likes. Doesn't change the fact that not having them is a daily pain in the ass.
[17:39:11] <snover> CSS itself is a daily pain in the ass
[17:39:15] <snover> specificity could be fixed incredibly easily
[17:39:30] <snover> or at least, made much less ass-pain-y
[17:39:31] <bartmax> lol
[17:39:49] <warrenparsons> snover: Again, give OOCSS a try if you haven't. It doesn't "fix" CSS, so to speak, but it makes it far less painful to use.
[17:40:09] <snover> all they need to do is separate element targeting from rule priority
[17:41:19] <imsky> preach brother snover
[17:41:39] <snover> warrenparsons: what are you talking about? http://oocss.org/ this?
[17:41:51] <bobbytek2> http://www.pixelastic.com/blog/201:7-advices-to-start-using-oocss-as-a-coding-practice ?
[17:42:45] <warrenparsons> snover: Yep, that's it. I'm not making much use of the .mod section, as I haven't quite been able to make it fit with a marketing website. But many of the concepts have been hugely beneficial when applied to basic styling.
[17:42:57] <warrenparsons> BRB - puppy has to go out.
[17:44:16] <snover> the purpose of css is to separate style from markup, not to bake it into the classes on the elements like â€œsizeXofYâ€
[17:45:05] <warrenparsons> And we're back. So glad the puppy does his business quickly anymore...
[17:45:07] <snover> though honestly at this point in the game it probably doesnâ€™t matter
[17:45:19] <imsky> hallelujah!
[17:45:31] <warrenparsons> snover: It's a tradeoff, really.
[17:45:59] <warrenparsons> snover: I'd rather deal with slightly more presentation in my classnames and more classes on elements than the hell that is specificity wars.
[17:47:07] <eddiemonge> if you dont use id's how would style something like a page header?
[17:47:23] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: What do you mean?
[17:47:31] <snover> eddiemonge: donâ€™t be a troll
[17:47:58] <devildue> ip-45-113.bnaa.dk
[17:48:11] <eddiemonge> im not. im generally curious. if there is only one element on a page (and only ever will be one), are you suggesting to still use a classname instead of an id?
[17:48:18] <snover> YES.
[17:48:35] <eddiemonge> so in essence you are just replacing "id" with "class"
[17:49:18] <warrenparsons> We recently had to add four more devs to our frontend team of two on this project (total of 6 now) due to an accelerated timeline. We've gotten in each other's way far less than usual, largely due to the OOCSS concepts and relying heavily on classes that we defined in the first six weeks of the project. Honestly, it's been a huge benefit.
[17:49:43] <snover> in order to make it possible to actually change some styles in the header
[17:49:49] <snover> that might be shared other places in the code
[17:49:53] <snover> without having to double up your rules for no reason
[17:49:57] <snover> s/code/markup
[17:50:34] <eddiemonge> i can do that with ids
[17:50:36] <bartmax> snover: you are dropping id (a great tool [not overused like my 4 years old example]) out of css for no reason. do u ever had to maintain a site ?
[17:50:45] <perverse``> it's all about maintainability eddiemonge, it's not necessarily about declaring styles to one thing only, and there will only ever be one of that thing... but you should be declaring common styles in a common class
[17:51:05] <warrenparsons> What perverse`` said.
[17:51:08] <perverse``> e.g is every single declaration in that unique object not going to be anywhere else?
[17:51:08] <snover> eddiemonge: it is like a gang war
[17:51:12] <eddiemonge> perverse``: i do that. but i also use ids to target unique things
[17:51:32] <perverse``> for example, you could have a class that just makes text a certain colour, and then another class that makes a certain amount of padding
[17:51:33] <eddiemonge> i dont do things like #id .class a  though. or i try not to
[17:52:02] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: IDs provide no advantages in styling over classes, and have huge downsides when it comes time to override rules you specified in an ID-based descendent selector.
[17:52:06] <snover> eddiemonge: doesnâ€™t particularly matter if you didnâ€™t, that ID selector rules all other non-ID selectors
[17:52:28] <perverse``> there is one advantage to using ID's, imperceptibly, slightly faster rendering
[17:52:33] <perverse``> in theory anyway
[17:52:42] <bartmax> perverse``: and then you html looks like class="certain_color certain_padding stupid_clear somenicetextshadow thebeautifullbossgradientcolors ...." <-- wacala
[17:52:48] <perverse``> but it's not worth the drawbacks in maintainability imo
[17:52:53] <eddiemonge> since im only targeting one thing when using ids, over writing selectors is a non issue
[17:52:57] <perverse``> sure bartmax, but that's fine
[17:53:33] <perverse``> and i mean it's up to the developer to not get retarded with modularity i suppose
[17:53:34] <bobbytek2> Is it?
[17:53:42] <bartmax> perverse``: ok, i think totally different, i use it totally opposite to that. and yes, it's faster rendering on devices with no such common pc processors.
[17:54:06] <snover> bartmax: you would probably improve your rendering speed more if your selector chains were shorter.
[17:54:08] <perverse``> explain to me why it isn't, bobbytek2?
[17:54:40] <perverse``> agreed, short selector chains is more important than class vs id, because the parser begins from the end of the chain and works its way to the front
[17:54:43] * warrenparsons used to use IDs for styling. But he found a 12-step program and got a sponsor.
[17:54:57] <bartmax> and the, someone ask you to change some 'style' on some unique item and you go and see if you have a class that do that (or likely) or write a new class... no difference from stlye="..."
[17:55:00] <perverse``> so even if u are declaring by #id .blah .blah - you're still getting a slow render regardless, it's only faster on the last "hop"
[17:55:15] <snover> CSS engines evaluate RTL which means every time you use a child selector you are requiring (naÃ¯ve) CSS engines to walk all the way up to the root of the DOM instead of being able to just check each element on its own
[17:55:21] <snover> CSS engines are actually significantly smarter than this
[17:55:23] <bartmax> snover: i know.
[17:55:33] <snover> but if we are going to talk about â€œmaking it fasterâ€, start there
[17:55:33] <perverse``> honestly guys, have a look at 960.gs if you don't believe in the benefits of classes vs ID's
[17:55:35] <snover> not with ID selectors
[17:55:43] <snover> anyway Iâ€™m outta.
[17:55:45] <snover> here.
[17:55:46] <ragas> ive got a jquery slideshow that i could use some help understanding.  It works, but i need to extend the functionality. http://pastie.org/2683737  trying to randomize the first slide.
[17:55:50] <perverse``> the power of that system is pretty incredible for what is essentially a bunch of stylesheets
[17:56:02] <bartmax> bye
[17:56:05] <warrenparsons> perverse``: We make use of 960 on nearly every project.
[17:56:13] <perverse``> 960 is brilliant
[17:56:22] <bartmax> perverse``: ok, that's it... i think 960 sucks :D lol
[17:56:24] <perverse``> i was an unbeliever until i used it
[17:56:31] <n|ne> unless your visitors are vision impaired
[17:56:40] <perverse``> in what ways does it suck, bartmax?
[17:56:58] <warrenparsons> And it's even more brilliant when you make variants of all the grid classes that are 2px narrower so you can apply borders directly to them when needed without everything going kablooie :D
[17:57:25] <n|ne> but it still sucks if you need to increase the font to thumb-sized letters
[17:57:30] <bartmax> perverse``: because i think the other way around... a X section has a Y way of rendering, here there and everywhere else. not a X style is used in N things .
[17:58:04] <warrenparsons> ... of course that wouldn't be necessary if box-sizing worked in certain MS products...
[17:58:07] <eddiemonge> 960 sucks in that it requires a lot added to the mark up
[17:58:19] <perverse``> well, im glad im not maintaining your codebase, but whatever works for you i suppose
[17:59:00] <bartmax> perverse``: i think the same lol
[17:59:06] <bartmax> it works for me, yes
[17:59:10] <bartmax> really great
[17:59:15] <eddiemonge> ragas: that would probably be better as a plugin. if nothing else it will make it "together"
[17:59:58] <m0nkfish> can someone suggest a plugin that i can use to represent a 1-5 rating (a star-based system or similar)
[18:00:30] <eddiemonge> i like how on the 960 site, a lot of (if not all) are using id based selectors heavily and yet that is the example site to look at for classes vs ids
[18:01:08] <eddiemonge> m0nkfish: that will require a backend to save the ratings so its kind of big
[18:01:36] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: There are a total of three ID attributes on the homepage. What are you talking about?
[18:01:45] <perverse``> eddiemonge - there are very few styles assigned by id on the 960.gs site?
[18:01:50] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: im talking about the example sites
[18:01:56] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: Ahh
[18:02:05] <eddiemonge> you know, "real" sites
[18:02:10] <perverse``> the example sites are built by users
[18:02:20] <m0nkfish> eddiemonge: it's simply to represent the ratings
[18:02:20] <perverse``> i think?
[18:02:24] <m0nkfish> i already have them in numerical form
[18:02:43] <m0nkfish> however, i want to build a js-based filter
[18:02:55] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: I build "real" sites constantly. And neither I nor my team (well, they're getting there) use IDs for styling.
[18:03:14] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: example site?
[18:03:15] <n|ne> why?
[18:03:17] <bartmax> perverse``: you should try to do 'my way' someday... probabilly you will dislike it, but ... who knows.
[18:03:25] <n|ne> it's a speed issue?
[18:03:30] <perverse``> i used to do things your way bartmax
[18:03:32] <eddiemonge> because the 960 site is designed to use its grid. not reflect real content
[18:03:37] <perverse``> im quite familiar with it
[18:03:37] <bartmax> perverse``: ok :)
[18:03:47] <perverse``> but working with other team members, the codebase became unweildly
[18:03:54] <eddiemonge> m0nkfish: what do you mean by filter?
[18:03:59] <perverse``> making concurrent changes to sites and whatnot became... messy
[18:04:08] <n|ne> warrenparsons, why do you never use ID for styling?
[18:04:13] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: http://www.peerlessfaucet.com/index.html is a fairly recent one.
[18:04:28] <warrenparsons> Before I started using OOCSS.
[18:04:51] <bartmax> perverse``: i should be missing something... i don't know :)
[18:04:52] <warrenparsons> n|ne: We just had a long discussion about it, but long story short: because they're a pain to override.
[18:05:01] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: you are using id's on that site. highly unoptimized and slow ids
[18:05:09] <n|ne> i see - thanks warrenparsons
[18:05:11] <eddiemonge> .header.main is basically an id
[18:05:23] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: And you have a problem with vocabulary.
[18:05:24] <perverse``> no it's not, lol
[18:05:46] <perverse``> that is not at all like an id
[18:05:56] <warrenparsons> .header.main is a class and subclass, if you must know.
[18:06:17] <warrenparsons> From before we started really using HTML5 native tags, which we are doing now.
[18:07:12] <bartmax> warrenparsons: lots of id selectors there
[18:07:22] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: do you/would you ever you .header.main anywhere else?
[18:07:42] <eddiemonge> or .footer.main?
[18:08:17] <bobbytek2> What about ie6?
[18:08:27] <perverse``> he may (or should) have common properties set in header
[18:08:28] <bobbytek2> subclasses don't work there
[18:08:31] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: You're missing the point. .header.footer are generic classes to act as counterparts to the similarly-named HTML5 elements, and could be used in many different contexts. The .main subclass is to indicate they are "main" or global to the site.
[18:08:33] <perverse``> such as font size, font colour, etc
[18:08:39] <perverse``> padding perhaps
[18:08:41] <perverse``> margins even
[18:08:43] <warrenparsons> bobbytek2: IE6 is not a concern.
[18:09:00] <perverse``> and then properties that are only applicable to "main" in main, obviously
[18:09:07] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: so then the "main" is a unique element right?
[18:09:19] <perverse``> not necessarily
[18:09:38] <perverse``> or he may want to use the exact same set of styles, but with a different font colour for a header on another page
[18:09:47] <warrenparsons> perverse``: Exactly.
[18:10:01] <perverse``> so he can shift into header.blue
[18:10:07] <perverse``> or some such
[18:10:11] <warrenparsons> And bartmax, most of the IDs are intended for use as JS hooks, not style hooks.
[18:10:23] <eddiemonge> going through the stylesheet, i see only .header.main used. and its used like that consistently
[18:10:36] <bartmax> what if i want to change the font-size of <h1>Ask A Coach</h1>
[18:10:44] <bartmax> i inspect and see body#site-home div.faucet-coach h1
[18:11:07] <bartmax> if that isn't UNIQUE, how do i know if im not changing ANYTHING else if i go for font-size:48 to 54
[18:11:14] <perverse``> then i would say it's likely a commonly used colour on your template, if your designer has any sense for design
[18:11:24] <warrenparsons> bartmax: Yeah, you do. It's unfortunate that it's there, but what can I say? No site is perfect. But the one I'm working on now is better than the one that came before, and so it goes.
[18:11:28] <perverse``> and you should have a class for that colour/boldness configuration
[18:11:40] <kborchers> Wow, did I accidentally join #css?
[18:11:41] <perverse``> <h2 class="blueBold">
[18:11:46] <eddiemonge> bartmax: yeah that example is really bad, for either side of the argument
[18:11:47] <bartmax> warrenparsons: i understand that, it's ok... we all have this type of things.
[18:11:53] <eddiemonge> kborchers: yeah
[18:12:08] <bobbytek2> I feel somewhat responsible
[18:12:17] <bobbytek2> I asked about less and got more :P
[18:12:23] <perverse``> lol
[18:12:45] <eddiemonge> my point is that on that site .header.main could easily (and probably should) be replaced with #headermain. it would work much faster
[18:12:58] <bartmax> i dont like the full of class elements... i don't see a benefit over style="lots of names with values" ....
[18:13:05] <warrenparsons> I can say, however, that if there are any ID selectors used for styling on my current project, I sure as shit didn't write them. And if I do spot them, the party responsible will be refactoring it.
[18:13:17] <perverse``> in my experience, working with ID's works up to a point.. but once you're working on big systems with multiple developers, modularity and maintainability are your key concerns
[18:14:08] <eddiemonge> and id is perfectly valid as a css selector. in fact, that is one of the things it is specifically meant for in the html spec
[18:14:09] <bartmax> perverse``: still, you don't need ids (i dont use much of them) to have a cleaner and defined elements with its properties instead of a bunch of grouped properties
[18:14:36] <warrenparsons> perverse``: Very much so. Most of my projects span several months and have 2-4 frontend devs working on them at any one time. Compatibility with that situation is critical.
[18:14:43] <perverse``> i really think we're discussing this at different levels
[18:15:01] <perverse``> it's not invalid to declare a style by id, there is nothign inheritly wrong with doing that
[18:15:02] <eddiemonge> perverse``:  i agree. im not saying use ids for every single element, im just saying use them when you are styling a unique element that wont be anywhere else
[18:15:05] <perverse``> it is valid any way you cut it
[18:15:16] <perverse``> however, from a best practices point of view, it's just not ideal
[18:15:35] <bartmax> perverse``: isn't ideal also to have every div with at least 3 classes...
[18:15:44] <perverse``> why isn't it, bartmax?
[18:16:12] <perverse``> it's absolutely ideal to be able to completely transform boxes in a modular way, by adding and removing class names from your markup
[18:16:26] <warrenparsons> Once you get used to just the spacing section of OOCSS, you'll never go back to setting margins and padding individually on every selector.
[18:16:26] <bartmax> perverse``: just do style="clear:both; color:red; text-weight:bold" and you have your 3 classes :)
[18:16:34] <IanWizard-Cloud> Greets :)
[18:16:41] <m0nkfish> eddiemonge: i retrieve a list of js objects which will have a rating property (a number from 1-5). i am currently using a select (combo box) as user input for the minimum rating of a displayable object
[18:16:48] <perverse``> but then i can't use that same declaration in 50 different spots, bartmax
[18:16:53] <eddiemonge> the class over id argument is a newer one that i have yet to see a valid reason for. yes for most cases, you should be using classes but a lot of elements in a site are unique and so using classes for that (as well as usually having an id for js) is just wasteful to me. use the id that is already there instead of doing something like .header.main.top
[18:16:55] <perverse``> that is a hopeless argument
[18:17:05] <bartmax> perverse``: what's the difference : class="clearfix" to style="clear:both"
[18:17:08] <perverse``> and the complete opposite of what im suggesting, actually
[18:17:18] <lenswipe> hey guys
[18:17:18] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: Do you work in a team environment, on sites that have multiple CSS files?
[18:17:21] <lenswipe> can someone help me?
[18:17:24] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: yes
[18:17:25] <perverse``> nothing bartmax, but what if you have 5 properties assigned to "clearfix"
[18:17:42] <eddiemonge> m0nkfish: you lost me there
[18:17:43] <perverse``> and you want to assign those same 5 properties to 4 divs?
[18:17:52] <lenswipe> im using fadeout() and i have a div containing ul, li, a
[18:17:57] <lenswipe> several lis
[18:18:01] <perverse``> and then you have another 3 properties that you want on only 2 of those divs
[18:18:03] <bartmax> perverse``: you are doing style markup on your html, just using css to gorup 3 or 4 properties.
[18:18:15] <perverse``> absolutely not bartmax
[18:18:16] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: And you don't find yourself fighting with other devs over specificity? Using !important at the 11th hour when your timeline has gone tits-up and you've been in the office for 14 hours?
[18:18:24] <imsky> holy shit
[18:18:28] <imsky> i'm away like an hour
[18:18:28] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: you have to actually state a problem to get an answer
[18:18:37] <imsky> and you're still talking about why you don't know how to shot css
[18:18:39] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, im in the process of doing so
[18:18:45] <m0nkfish> eddiemonge: basically i'd like to replace a combo box that has the options 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 with an input that more accurantely reflects the nature of the data (the data is a 'rating')
[18:18:47] <lenswipe> i want it so that when my mouse is no longer in the <div> fadeout is executed, however this seems to happen when i stop hovering over the first li
[18:18:50] <lenswipe> can someone help?

[18:19:58] <perverse``> well your point of view isn't accepted as good practice, bartmax, but you can continue as you please

[18:20:07] <bobbytek2> it seems as though css development has gone full circle

[18:20:19] <perverse``> you're not very open to discussing the topic, just refuting anything i say with incorrect assertions
[18:20:20] <bobbytek2> I tend to agree with bartmax
[18:20:21] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, then try and point your mouse and the second item in the dropdown
[18:20:30] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, thats the problem - but i dont understand why its doing that :/
[18:20:41] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: in IE? because chrome is fine

[18:21:57] <bartmax> i just cant...
[18:22:06] <Rusty_Mr-JS> thank you bobbytek2
[18:22:16] <warrenparsons> I think the biggest disservice to frontend devs has been the lie that you can redesign a real site just by swapping out the CSS. That's where most of the dogma around keeping your classes completely semantic, and enforcing that idea with draconian rigor, stems from. IMO
[18:22:43] <bobbytek2> I also agree
[18:22:53] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, you know what?
[18:23:03] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, theres no second item in the list is there...
[18:23:05] <bartmax> and of course, I do a mix... for something really generic like a ok button site-wide i use it like a generic class... but for main parts i dont.
[18:23:06] <bobbytek2> And a similar argument goes to tables vs. semantic markup
[18:23:10] <lenswipe> i forgot i was logged into the site
[18:23:18] <perverse``> well i mean if you think declaring thing sin style="" is equal to what we're saying, i'm going to struggle to make you understand the benefits bartmax
[18:23:29] <eddiemonge> bobbytek2: not really. there is no debate in that one
[18:23:32] <eddiemonge> tables are bad
[18:23:35] <perverse``> because you're either trolling me saying that, or arn't at a level of understanding required
[18:23:39] <eddiemonge> thats universally agreed upon
[18:23:52] <bobbytek2> I don't know about that eddiemonge
[18:23:57] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, try now
[18:24:00] <perverse``> and i don't say that to be a jerk, the only thing i can suggest is looking at how 960.gs works, realising the power it actually grants you, and work from there
[18:24:03] <bobbytek2> They are good for tabular data for sure
[18:24:08] <eddiemonge> bobbytek2: unless you are doing html emails, tables are bad for layout
[18:24:12] <bobbytek2> And for layout sometimes
[18:24:20] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, hover over "Home" and watch what happens when you try and get to the second item in the dropdown menu
[18:24:24] * warrenparsons finds it much harder to build a simple page with tables than a very complex page with modern technologies. And he used to be able to do unholy things with tables and frames back in the day.
[18:25:00] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: paste the relevant code at jsfiddle since there is a lot to dig through on your site
[18:25:01] <bartmax> perverse``: im just traspolating the concept... also, if my product list has a padding-left of 20px and my header p too, there's nothing that bind them together to use a same .leftGeneralPadding class ... because it would be impossible to update.
[18:25:16] <bartmax> in my 'really humble' pov..
[18:25:18] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, okay
[18:25:27] <perverse``> ok bartmax, taking your example
[18:25:29] <bobbytek2> So http://giveupandusetables.com/ no longer applies?
[18:25:43] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: and id recommend learning about chaining
[18:25:44] <perverse``> you have .paddingLeft { padding-left: 20px; } in your stylesheet
[18:26:01] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, okay
[18:26:07] <perverse``> and that is assigned to all of your .articleHolder divs, or whatever
[18:26:14] <bartmax> ok
[18:26:15] <bobbytek2> Or was that just a passing phase and then came blueprint, 960 et al?
[18:26:25] <perverse``> you get a request from management that the padding on the site has to change
[18:26:30] <perverse``> the gap is too big
[18:26:32] <eddiemonge> bobbytek2: "The hacks and conditional comments ruin our clean markup" tables ruin the clean markup
[18:26:32] <perverse``> it should be 10px
[18:26:32] <warrenparsons> See? .paddingLeft is ugly IMO. But something like .plm (padding, left, medium) is fine.
[18:26:45] <perverse``> im just using it as an example warrenparsons
[18:26:54] <warrenparsons> perverse``: I figured. Just opining.
[18:27:03] <perverse``> now if you had delcared each of your paddings for your divs in the style=""
[18:27:10] <perverse``> you would need to change the markup of every div in the system
[18:27:18] <perverse``> and if you had declared all your paddings by id on each of the divs
[18:27:29] <perverse``> you would need to change each of the css declarations
[18:27:35] <bobbytek2> so it's nothing more than redirection?
[18:27:39] <bobbytek2> er, indirection
[18:27:42] <bartmax> perverse``: good, starting to understand. What if you need to change ONLY the header padding ?
[18:27:42] <eddiemonge> bobbytek2: im not sure what the site is. yeah if you like shitty code that no one likes then use tables. if you want a layout that can never change then use tables
[18:27:55] <perverse``> but using classes, you would need to only change the one common declaration
[18:28:00] <devildue> Where do I get shit?
[18:28:07] <perverse``> then you would use specifity to change it, bartmax
[18:28:09] <devildue> Err, where can I find someone who has access to Ancestry.com?
[18:28:22] <bartmax> perverse``: so you override the rule ...
[18:28:40] <perverse``> well, you wouldn't have paddingLeft as a class assigned to that div anymore
[18:28:41] <eddiemonge> devildue: stop trolling
[18:28:45] <perverse``> as that padding is no longer applicable

[18:29:13] <bartmax> perverse``: so you remove the class from the HTML to remove the padding...
[18:29:37] <perverse``> potentially bartmax
[18:29:46] <perverse``> in this example you could do it 2 ways
[18:29:50] <eddiemonge> which means your HTML markup is no longer semantically correct. it is now your styling layer as well
[18:30:19] <perverse``> if you had other properties in paddingLeft that were still applicable, you would just add a class and declare, with added specificity, your new padding values
[18:30:36] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/BJmbU/2/
[18:30:39] <perverse``> if nothing in paddingLeft applied to the div any longer, then you could remove it altogether
[18:31:05] <bartmax> perverse``: i somehow see that it's not so ugly that I thought.. instead, you are touching HTML to change style, that something i don't 'like'... also, you could potentially end up with over specificity over classes that you really dont need anymore... i should try it. Over the air, i don't like it at all.
[18:31:24] <bartmax> perverse``: problem is you don't know how many divs have paddingLeft, so it will be forever on your css...
[18:31:50] <perverse``> view source -> ctrl+f -> "paddingLeft"
[18:31:57] <perverse``> ?
[18:31:57] <bartmax> unless you use some parser to see which classes aren't used among a whole site.
[18:32:00] <perverse``> grep?
[18:32:17] <bartmax> perverse``: yes, you can build a parser in C++ too ...
[18:32:19] <bartmax> that's not the point
[18:32:33] <perverse``> no system is perfect, bartmax
[18:32:37] <bobbytek2> the point is that web development is messy
[18:32:40] <warrenparsons> bartmax: If you standardize on using classes for spacing/padding that are separate from your more module-specific classes, it becomes second nature. An element either has a particular spacing class or it doesn't.
[18:32:48] <bartmax> i know, i see the pros and cons now... before, i was only seeing cons :)
[18:32:48] <perverse``> the benefits of doing things this way, as i said, are generally maintainability
[18:33:03] <bobbytek2> That's why I was hoping that less could help out in some of these regards
[18:33:09] <perverse``> having site wide declarations that can be changed quickly and efficiently by teams of developers
[18:33:19] <bobbytek2> Sounds like things are moving backwards
[18:33:24] <abjorn> http://xkcd.com/
[18:33:24] <abjorn> ^ the most true thing of all time in all existence
[18:33:33] <bartmax> thanks for the enlightment perverse`` and believe me, i will css code with this in mind, i may try it. If it makes my life better is welcome, look like? very unlikely.
[18:33:36] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: make it easier: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/BJmbU/5/
[18:33:40] <bobbytek2> The way I use to program with css before I new about now outdated techniques...
[18:33:59] <lenswipe> ok
[18:34:00] <perverse``> generally what i find is that using this method, my stylesheets end up much smaller
[18:34:13] <perverse``> with a bit of extra markup, because you rarely ever declare the same property twice
[18:34:16] <bartmax> perverse``: that's really interesting
[18:34:34] <bartmax> perverse``: except if you html is full of classes...
[18:34:41] <perverse``> it's just a tool for oyu to use, bartmax, i hope it evolves your code
[18:34:46] <perverse``> it's not always going to be applicable
[18:34:52] <perverse``> id's arn't like, redundant or anything, lol
[18:35:05] <perverse``> but it is a powerful way to look at things
[18:35:35] <bartmax> perverse``: everything evolves codes and thats why i like this type of discussion... i guess works similar way for u 2
[18:35:43] <perverse``> definitely
[18:35:48] <perverse``> :)
[18:36:10] <perverse``> i guess the good thing about being challenged too, is that it makes you look at what your doing and the reasons for it, too
[18:36:57] <bartmax> perverse``: wont be the first time doing something so wrong thinking it's the best way :)
[18:37:18] <perverse``> bah i do it daily, lol
[18:37:37] <warrenparsons> It's called refactoring.
[18:38:01] <bartmax> warrenparsons: yea... im addicted to it :)
[18:38:59] <warrenparsons> bartmax: But seriously, give what perverse`` was describing a chance. Look up OOCSS for a more structured approach. It has changed the way I approach my CSS and made life a hell of a lot easier.
[18:39:26] <bartmax> warrenparsons: without a doubt i will
[18:39:42] <perverse``> yeah, it made my life easier too, and i think what i realised too is that my life being easier as a programmer is more beneficial than render speed or whatever too
[18:39:48] <perverse``> too too too too
[18:39:49] <perverse``> lol
[18:40:16] <perverse``> unless a job specifically needs every single millisecond of render speed, that is
[18:40:39] <warrenparsons> In that case there are better ways to optimize than trying to cut down on the number of classes you're using.
[18:40:49] <perverse``> yeah i would agree with that
[18:40:54] <bartmax> warrenparsons: agree too
[18:40:55] <perverse``> too
[18:41:06] * warrenparsons base64 image encoding FTW
[18:41:09] <bartmax> ;)
[18:41:45] <bartmax> just you mention it... what tool do u use for base64 image encoding to css ?
[18:41:47] <bartmax> manually ?
[18:41:57] <warrenparsons> The homepage on my current project will make a sum total of 1 http request for an image. The other 3 non-inlined images will be lazy-loaded into a rotator after the load event fires.
[18:42:02] <warrenparsons> Thanks to base64 encoding.
[18:42:53] <warrenparsons> This is the one I use http://websemantics.co.uk/online_tools/image_to_data_uri_convertor/
[18:43:24] <warrenparsons> And always recompress your PNG files before using it. It helps.
[18:43:27] <Wardrop> If I want to define a whole load of prototype functions, is it safe to do something like: MyObject.prototype = { myMethod: function () {} }
[18:43:45] <Wardrop> That won't override built-in prototype methods will it?
[18:44:27] <bartmax> Wardrop: i suggest stay away from prototype.... unlease, you are using prototype lib.. :)
[18:44:58] <Wardrop> bartmax: Really, why's that? I thought prototype was the most effecient way of defining "classes" in JavaScript.
[18:45:10] <Wardrop> I'm not talking about modifying the prototype of any built-in objects.
[18:45:38] * warrenparsons still thinks imposing classical OO concepts on JS is a bastardization.
[18:46:36] <Wardrop> I want to be able to manage state of many of the same types of objects. Using objects only seems logical.
[18:46:48] <perverse``> funny you say that warrenparsons, i've been using entwine/concrete lately for jquery and it's actually really awesome, lol
[18:46:54] <bartmax> Wardrop: why no Function MyObject() { var myMethod = function() {}  }
[18:46:57] <perverse``> https://github.com/hafriedlander/jquery.entwine
[18:47:23] <Wardrop> bartmax: Because you're redefining the same method for each instance. It's not as effecient.
[18:47:43] <warrenparsons> perverse``: Very interesting.
[18:47:49] <Wardrop> new MyObject() will recreate "myMethod" everytime it's instantiated.
[18:47:56] <devildue> Do you have access to http://www.ancestry.com and could look up a person's name?
[18:47:58] <perverse``> yeah warrenparsons, i've been supremely impressed with the patterns i've been able to achieve
[18:48:01] <perverse``> in fact, check this out
[18:48:12] <warrenparsons> devildue: You do realize this is a discussion channel for jQuery, right?
[18:48:28] <perverse``> http://www.pastie.org/2686415
[18:48:54] <perverse``> basically i've got a whole page of ".NPanel", and i have a common sendrequest method that exists for each of those dom objects
[18:49:07] <perverse``> now each of these panels could be different panel types
[18:49:15] <perverse``> like TreePanel or EditPanel
[18:49:44] <perverse``> basically each of THOSE panel types have different, individual methods that all use the common sendrequest method to send their ajax requests through
[18:49:45] <warrenparsons> So .entwine is basically generating a UI block here?
[18:50:16] <perverse``> and there's a common controller on the server side that grabs the requests and pipes them off to their individual controllers to actually do the work
[18:50:43] <perverse``> the server then sends back relevant data and a callback function (CallbackName), which is then fired on the individual panel
[18:50:45] <warrenparsons> Very cool.
[18:50:50] <perverse``> yeah, it's pretty funky
[18:50:56] <perverse``> only scratching the surface, too
[18:51:33] <warrenparsons> Bookmarked. I know my counterpart on the Programming team will dig this too.
[18:51:42] <perverse``> :)
[18:52:03] <devildue> They see me mowin' my front lawn
[18:52:04] <devildue> I know they're all thinkin' I'm so
[18:52:05] <devildue> White and nerdy
[18:52:07] <devildue> Think I'm just too white and nerdy
[18:52:07] <devildue> Think I'm just too white and nerdy
[18:52:08] <devildue> Can't you see I'm white and nerdy
[18:52:09] <devildue> Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
[18:52:10] <devildue> I wanna roll with the gangstas
[18:52:12] <devildue> But so far they all think I'm too
[18:52:13] <devildue> White and nerdy
[18:52:14] <devildue> Think I'm just too white and nerdy
[18:52:14] <devildue> Think I'm just too white and nerdy
[18:52:15] <devildue> I'm just too white and nerdy
[18:52:15] <warrenparsons> He's pushing real hard to start using the Play framework as a replacement for Spring, et al.
[18:52:17] <devildue> Really, really white and nerdy
[18:52:18] <devildue>  
[18:52:20] <devildue> They see me mowing my front lawn
[18:52:20] <devildue> I know they're all thinking I'm so
[18:52:21] <devildue> White and great at math and science but socially unskilled and
[18:52:22] <devildue> unaccepted
[18:52:24] <devildue> Think I'm just too white and nerdy
[18:52:25] <devildue> Think I'm just too white and nerdy
[18:52:26] <devildue> Can't you see I'm white and nerdy
[18:52:27] <devildue> Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
[18:52:28] <devildue> I want to go places with the gangsters
[18:52:28] <devildue> But so far they all think I'm too
[18:52:29] <devildue> White and nerdy
[18:52:31] <devildue> Think I'm just too white and nerdy
[18:52:31] <devildue> Think I'm just too white and nerdy
[18:52:33] <devildue> I'm just too white and nerdy
[18:52:34] <devildue> Really, really white and nerdy
[18:52:35] <devildue> First in my class here at MIT
[18:52:44] <perverse``> ah yeah warrenparsons
[18:52:45] <Brodingo> aww
[18:52:48] <perverse``> i havent worked with either
[18:53:07] <warrenparsons> perverse``: Spring works well enough, but it's a lot of overhead.
[18:53:17] <perverse``> yeah
[18:53:35] <perverse``> im more of a scriptboi, generally php+ client side stuff
[18:54:05] <warrenparsons> perverse``: I am by nature as well, but I've worked in primarily JSP-based environments the last seven years.
[18:54:13] <perverse``> only through laziness i suppose, like any developer you can get sorta comfy in your native environment, haha
[18:54:25] * warrenparsons still hates Java.
[18:54:28] <perverse``> rarely a good thing really
[18:54:36] * warrenparsons ... but not as much as he hates .NET.
[18:54:40] <perverse``> yeah, lol, i hate java purely from a user POV
[18:54:50] <perverse``> java apps are just typically clunky, still to this day imo, lol
[18:55:02] <perverse``> ugh yeah, .NET
[18:55:15] <warrenparsons> Server-side Java can be highly performant. It's just *heavy.*
[18:55:31] <perverse``> yeah, it's not particularly efficient
[18:55:35] <perverse``> is it even good on solaris?
[18:55:41] <perverse``> does solaris even still exist? lol
[18:55:48] <perverse``> i assume it does
[18:55:54] <warrenparsons> Couldn't say. Not my end of things.
[18:55:58] <perverse``> ah fair enough
[18:56:44] <perverse``> im not sure what the benefits are of java these days in any sense... aside from cross platform stuff i guess
[18:56:55] <warrenparsons> I know enough to write lightweight logic in the display layer, edit a controller file (with review by an engineer), etc. I'm the only frontend dev they trust to do that.
[18:57:05] <perverse``> haha yeah
[18:57:40] <warrenparsons> perverse``: The biggest benefit, if you can call it that, is its huge install base in the corporate world.
[18:57:44] <perverse``> seems to me that scripting languages can do pretty much anything you need faster than java on the server side anyway... im sure there are reasons to go java though
[18:57:56] <perverse``> ah yeah, big install base
[18:58:03] <warrenparsons> Most of the major corporate sites are either Java or .NET.
[18:58:04] <perverse``> also lots and lots of legacy stuff no doubt
[18:58:35] <warrenparsons> And working for an agency with largish clients, that's what we work on.
[18:58:54] <bobbytek2> why not grails warrenparsons ?
[18:59:02] <bobbytek2> or at least groovy
[18:59:15] <warrenparsons> bobbytek2: Because the clients usually have a chosen technology.
[18:59:22] <bobbytek2> I have used about 4 java web frameworks and the difference is night and day
[18:59:45] <bobbytek2> it runs on tomcat and uses best of breed java technologies
[19:00:00] <warrenparsons> Please don't ever use the term "best of breed." You sound like a sales asshole.
[19:00:02] <warrenparsons> ;)
[19:00:03] <bobbytek2> It just makes things so much quicker to develop
[19:00:24] <bobbytek2> Whatever, grails rocks
[19:00:30] <bobbytek2> What are you using?
[19:00:36] <warrenparsons> So I've heard. But in the end it's not my call.
[19:00:55] <warrenparsons> Mostly Spring on the Java side. I don't know what the .NET kids are using these days.
[19:01:10] <bobbytek2> Spring MVC?
[19:01:13] <warrenparsons> Yeah
[19:01:35] <bobbytek2> Grails is based off spring mvc, hibernate, sitemesh etc.
[19:01:40] <K1ng> what would be best way to get to form from <table><tr><td> HERE </td>
[19:02:03] <bobbytek2> Just makes them suck less
[19:02:15] <K1ng> <form><table><tr><td> HERE </td></tr></table></form>
[19:02:16] <K1ng> ?
[19:02:27] <bobbytek2> Way less :)
[19:02:33] <warrenparsons> bobbytek2: You're barking up the wrong tree. I'm frontend. Besides, my counterpart on the programming team wants to move us off Spring and onto something like Play. But we're generally a very busy shop, and finding time to test and prove a new technology isn't easy.
[19:02:44] <K1ng> jq('.pollResultsBar').parent().parent().parent().find('input')
[19:02:47] <kborchers> ?closest @ K1ng
[19:02:47] <bot-t> K1ng, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[19:02:50] <bobbytek2> Fair enough
[19:03:09] <bartmax> K1ng: closest
[19:03:14] <K1ng> ok
[19:03:18] <warrenparsons> I have it a lot easier, just because I don't generally need permission to do things in new ways.
[19:04:01] <warrenparsons> Hoping to drop IE7 support completely in 8-12 months.
[19:04:14] <K1ng> jq('.pollResultsBar').closest('form').find('#answer')
[19:04:15] <K1ng> yay
[19:04:43] <kborchers> K1ng: No
[19:04:45] <bartmax> K1ng: mmmm no
[19:04:59] <K1ng> ?
[19:05:01] <bartmax> K1ng: 1st, if you do .find('#answer') it means there's only one. (ID)
[19:05:07] <bartmax> so you should use $('#answer')
[19:05:18] <K1ng> there is multiple #answer :p
[19:05:23] <kborchers> Nooooooooooo
[19:05:27] <bartmax> K1ng: then, don't use an ID selector (#)
[19:05:31] <K1ng> and multiple forms
[19:05:48] <kborchers> Id's are unique!
[19:06:04] <K1ng> in whole html?
[19:06:09] <kborchers> Yes!
[19:06:15] <bartmax> K1ng: Yes, in whole html. now, why you start with the .pollResultsBar
[19:06:16] <K1ng> ah
[19:06:29] <K1ng> .pollResultsBar is TD's class
[19:06:30] <bartmax> K1ng: actually, getById return 1 element... not a list of elements.
[19:06:32] <warrenparsons> K1ng: This video is for you http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r5aAhNk4Ws
[19:06:34] <K1ng> just for test
[19:07:03] <bartmax> K1ng: why you don't code all around your form(s) ?
[19:07:32] <K1ng> bartmax, i dont know what that mean
[19:08:33] <bartmax> K1ng: i don't know what you are trying to do, but you can $('form').each(function() { $this = $(this); $answer = $this.find('.answer'), etc... and create the events... })
[19:09:34] <K1ng> i am creating a poll like facebook
[19:10:01] <bartmax> ok. (don't use facebook, but i know how a poll works)
[19:10:20] <bartmax> so you have basically a form with some option and when you submit you want to ... ?
[19:10:32] <bartmax> mark if the answer is correct or not and show the real answer etc ?
[19:10:35] <K1ng> yeah
[19:10:43] <K1ng> no
[19:10:50] <bartmax> ok, you want to .... ?
[19:10:53] <K1ng> you can add option to poll.
[19:10:58] <K1ng> hold on
[19:11:18] <K1ng> http://puu.sh/6VaU
[19:11:41] <bartmax> ?
[19:12:07] <warrenparsons> IRC skills are failing me...
[19:12:23] <bartmax> that's one form...
[19:12:27] <bartmax> not multiple
[19:12:41] <K1ng> just for test :)
[19:12:50] <K1ng> there will be more :)
[19:12:58] <bartmax> more for what ?
[19:13:05] <K1ng> more questions?
[19:13:13] <bartmax> ok.
[19:13:27] <bartmax> so you have a question and you enter 'option' as possible reponses?
[19:13:31] <K1ng> people can add their own answer and vote on them
[19:14:03] <K1ng> NodeX, you can add an option, if not listed on the poll, then vote on it :)
[19:14:11] <grom358> http://pastebin.com/00pv2XA6 . Can think of better way to make the selected item be on top?
[19:14:16] <coldhead> you okay warrenparsons?
[19:15:17] <bartmax> k1ng ok, so you submit the form, save the option on DB and list all the options... dont see what needs to be done in js, apart from ajax support.
[19:16:26] <K1ng> since its only got one hidden. so i have to change the value of the hidden and submit the form
[19:16:31] <bartmax> K1ng: you know you can create anywhere inside the <form /> tag a <button type="submit">submit</button> right ?
[19:16:43] <K1ng> yes
[19:17:13] <bartmax> K1ng: why would you need to change the value of a hidden input ?
[19:17:16] <K1ng> but its going to work with hit enter and click :). people will be allowed to change vote
[19:17:24] <K1ng> to submit?
[19:17:35] <K1ng> erm
[19:17:41] <K1ng> i dont know
[19:22:43] <xjiujiu> Hi
[19:23:39] <bartmax> K1ng: http://pastebin.com/hxnvr9m6
[19:24:00] <bartmax> K1ng: something like that
[19:26:38] <K1ng> to be honest, you have no idea what i am doing
[19:26:59] <bartmax> i dont :D â–¼
[19:33:29] <warrenparsons> Dang. I leave for 15 minutes and the party dies.
[19:34:31] <ericlewis> this is probably a stupid question but anyone hear of gettingElementsByCSS?
[19:37:49] <rhizmoe> is that a book or something?
[19:38:30] <ericlewis> nah...
[19:38:33] <ericlewis> lol
[19:38:38] * warrenparsons has heard of querySelectorAll...
[19:39:37] <ericlewis> hmm that's interesting
[19:39:58] <ericlewis> almost looks like a jquery method
[19:40:36] <warrenparsons> That's because it's based on the same idea as the Sizzle engine.
[19:41:03] <warrenparsons> And Sizzle uses it under the hood for browsers that support it.
[19:42:47] <ericlewis> cool
[19:42:53] <ericlewis> is it not widely a supported method?
[19:43:09] <luite> I have some div with a wide table that I want to use in a jquery-ui dialog, unfortunately the dialog is too small: the table falls outside the dialog.
[19:43:31] <warrenparsons> This page lists it's browser support - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Document.querySelectorAll
[19:43:33] <context> make the dialog bigger ?
[19:43:38] <warrenparsons> er...its (gah!)
[19:43:48] <luite> how can I make sure that it's big enough without scrolling? code here: http://jsbin.com/ijifiv/edit#preview
[19:44:22] <luite> context: yeah I can specify a width in pixels, but then people with other browser settings, like a bigger font size, might still see a scrollbar
[19:44:37] <warrenparsons> IE7 is basically the only browser in common usage (or that I support) which doesn't implement it.
[19:44:40] <luite> so I really want it to automatically size to the contents, somehow
[19:45:06] <context> luite: can you define em width ?
[19:45:57] <luite> context: how many em is a table... you'd need to know the font being used, the width of the individual charachters, way too hairy imho
[19:46:33] <luite> at least I'd highly prefer another solution if there is one :)
[19:46:50] <luite> (required browsers: IE9+, recent firefox, chrome, safari)
[19:49:16] <warrenparsons> luite: You could grab the outerwidth of the table when it renders and update your dialog's width to accomodate it. #justThrowingShitOutThere
[19:50:46] <luite> warrenparsons: hmm, yeah that's possible, but isn't there a way to use css or something similar, to make sure that the containing div is at least as wide as the table?
[19:51:25] <luite> perhaps it's more a css problem than a jquery problem, I'm not sure
[19:51:25] <warrenparsons> The containing div, absent a set width, will always be as wide as the table.
[19:51:50] <luite> warrenparsons: that's not true, ee my example and resize your window
[19:52:05] <tfitts> does anyone here have experience using jquery/jquery mobile with iphones and html5 manifest/offline mode?
[19:52:08] <luite> (at least in safari 5.1.1 here)
[19:52:57] <warrenparsons> It is true, your dialog has a set width, however.
[19:53:16] <luite> warrenparsons: what is true?
[19:53:43] <warrenparsons> My prior statement about containing divs, widths, etc.
[19:53:46] <warrenparsons> Not that it matters.
[19:53:56] <luite> if I resize my browser window, make it narrower than the table, some of the letters are outside the border of the div
[19:54:57] <warrenparsons> Anyway, why are you using a table in the first place?
[19:55:35] <luite> warrenparsons: well this is just an example, in my real content I have a table with some information for the user
[19:55:46] <warrenparsons> I hope it's tabular data.
[19:55:50] <luite> yes
[19:56:11] <warrenparsons> The thing is I think you're going to need to set a width, at least as a starting point.
[19:57:19] <luite> yeah the reason that I have a table is that I don't always know the size of all the contents. some columns may need to be wider due to the content (images). so the problem is that I don't know the exact size in advance
[19:57:29] <warrenparsons> The dialog element needs a width, or it's going to end up the full width of the browser window, being a block-level element.
[19:57:35] <luite> and I have multiple similar dialogs, all with different kinds of tables
[19:58:59] <warrenparsons> Yeah, there's really nothing in CSS that will work in concert with the JS-set width of the dialog to get you where you need to be.
[19:59:12] <warrenparsons> You pretty much have to override that width in JS when needed.
[19:59:47] <luite> hmm ok
[20:01:22] <warrenparsons> Which actually gives me some food for thought on the dropdown nav panels on my current project, and a way to remove the need to set their width explicitly in CSS...
[20:39:11] <abjorn> :( Dennis Richie
[20:39:24] <coldhead> vale, dennis ritchie
[20:39:30] <Tuxiscool> Hello. Does anyone know of a tool for creating image carousels that can show part of the 'next' and 'previous' image if the current image doesn't occupy all the available space?
[20:41:25] <coldhead> Tuxiscool: it's probably faster to write something yourself than it would be to find something with that feature
[20:42:04] <Tuxiscool> Right. Oh well.
[20:42:32] <coldhead> i can't think of one that does it because i habitually write my own now
[20:42:53] <grom358> http://pastebin.com/DC9HZ7h5 ... why is my animate doing the animation from the original location?
[20:43:15] <cypha> coldhead, do you usually have a non-js route on your websites?
[20:43:18] <Tuxiscool> coldhead: A habit quite familiar to me in a different arena.
[20:43:21] <cypha> for people that don't have it enabled
[20:43:31] <coldhead> Tuxiscool: http://www.lemmonjuice.com/demos/carousel/example4.html
[20:43:38] * abjorn cries for Dennis Ritchie
[20:43:48] <coldhead> googling for jQuery carousel variable gives a lot of promising leads
[20:44:17] <coldhead> cypha: back when men wore hates, i did that ALL the time: the entire site without JS and then JS added on top of that
[20:44:21] <coldhead> hats* lol
[20:44:33] <luite> warrenparsons: I found out how to do it: first set display: inline-block; on the containing div, to make sure it doesn't get narrower than its contents. then open the dialog with the default 300px width. then query the width of the div (now inside the dialog, new styling), and resize the div with .dialog('option'...) if it's wider than the default width
[20:44:44] <coldhead> but nowadays there's no time for that, and people without JS can eat balls
[20:44:47] <luite> and another call to recenter
[20:44:50] <coldhead> it's sad :(
[20:45:03] <cypha> coldhead, i just realized fb has no fallback
[20:45:09] <Tuxiscool> coldhead: Thank you!
[20:45:17] <coldhead> that's the way of the world now cypha
[20:45:22] <cypha> and if I do the whole site without a fallback, my html look a WHOLE lot cleaner in programming
[20:45:24] <coldhead> but in our hearts we know it's wrong
[20:45:30] <cypha> exactly!
[20:45:53] <coldhead> i would recommend only doing sites you don't care about
[20:46:06] <cypha> well, it's my own site
[20:46:12] <coldhead> and then <noscript>Seriously, you're missing nothing</noscript>
[20:46:17] <cypha> so you think I should have a fallback if I care about it?
[20:46:27] <cypha> lmao
[20:46:30] <coldhead> cypha: do you expect to have many non-JS users
[20:46:39] <coldhead> and is your site still crawlable without JS?
[20:46:48] <coldhead> it should at least be crawlable
[20:46:48] <cypha> i never met anyone that didn't have it enabled
[20:46:53] <coldhead> if it's inaccessible
[20:46:55] <cypha> crawlable, meaning?
[20:47:03] <coldhead> that google can still reach all the content
[20:47:07] <coldhead> ?w googlebot
[20:47:08] <bot-t> coldhead, Googlebot - Googlebot is the search bot software used by Google, which collects documents from the web to build a searchable index for the Google search engine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlebot
[20:47:11] <coldhead> that guy
[20:47:15] <cypha> right
[20:47:18] <cypha> but how can I make sure of that?
[20:47:39] <coldhead> at the very least, ensure there is an actual link to every page
[20:47:46] <coldhead> that is accessible without JS
[20:47:48] <cypha> on the main page?
[20:48:01] <coldhead> but that's pretty much a non-js fallback right there
[20:48:10] <cypha> ya
[20:48:12] <coldhead> on the main page or on a page linked to by other pages
[20:48:15] <coldhead> somewhere it can find it
[20:48:23] <cypha> ur saying have a link that goes to another page that has a link that goes to data
[20:48:25] <coldhead> if this is just a portfolio site i wouldn't bother
[20:48:30] <iszak> hi coldhead
[20:48:44] <coldhead> i'm saying you want every URL accessible withotu JS
[20:48:50] <coldhead> even if they're not fully functional
[20:48:50] <cypha> k
[20:48:58] <cypha> sounds good
[20:49:07] <coldhead> g'day northern iszak!
[20:49:30] <iszak> don't remind me...
[20:49:32] <abjorn> lol what
[20:49:33] <cypha> coldhead, lay the tips on me, I could use them
[20:49:34] <cypha> :)
[20:51:45] <coldhead> winter in the UK is magical, iszak
[20:51:49] <coldhead> i envy you
[20:51:53] <coldhead> roasted chestnuts
[20:51:55] <iszak> it's nearly 5 AM and I want to die
[20:51:58] <coldhead> mulled wine
[20:52:03] <coldhead> saint swibben's day
[20:52:07] <grom358> nvm
[20:52:08] <grom358> fixed it
[20:52:13] <paul_irish> HE FIXED IT
[20:52:18] <Eviltwin> Hmm?
[20:52:33] <coldhead> good work grom358
[20:52:37] <coldhead> you're an inspiration
[20:52:41] <abjorn> I think
[20:52:43] <abjorn> we should take
[20:52:48] <abjorn> a minute of silence for dennis ritchie
[20:52:54] <abjorn> okay that's probably not gonna happen
[20:53:54] <coldhead> i think we should cat some wave files to /dev/null for him
[20:54:15] <iszak> only cat? why not mv
[20:54:33] <coldhead> because i love my wavs
[20:55:06] <iszak> wavs are for fools! flac is for pros
[20:55:50] <Eviltwin> Nice of paul_irish to momentarily grace us with his presence :P
[20:55:58] <paul_irish> sup twinsies
[20:56:23] <Eviltwin> The usual
[20:56:30] <Eviltwin> Avoiding declaring variable if at all possible
[20:57:11] <coldhead> hey at least it keeps you off the streets right?
[20:57:25] <Eviltwin> That it does
[20:57:29] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/JVpGU/
[20:57:36] <abjorn> cat myheartwillgoon.wav > /dev/null
[20:58:34] <iszak> I think cat <file> > /dev/kmem is better
[20:58:37] <iszak> someone should do it
[20:58:46] <abjorn> lol
[20:58:55] <Eviltwin> cat /dev/urandom > /dev/kmem
[20:59:00] <iszak> even better Eviltwin !!

[21:08:35] <abjorn> hi cypha
[21:08:43] <coldhead> cypha: the legal thing is true, the UK are very serious about that
[21:08:59] <coldhead> but you have to assume some disabled person would ever want to use your site
[21:09:01] <cypha> so all sites have to be fully accessible in the UK?
[21:09:11] <coldhead> apparently so
[21:09:19] <cypha> wow
[21:09:27] <coldhead> i don't know about prosecutions
[21:09:35] <coldhead> but they publish standards you're supposed to adhere to
[21:09:55] <cypha> wow
[21:09:58] <cypha> for any old site?
[21:10:01] <cypha> or only pay-for sites/
[21:10:02] <cypha> ?
[21:11:37] <coldhead> any old site, i believe
[21:11:40] <coldhead> but i am not a lawyer
[21:12:14] <cypha> interesting
[21:12:59] <cypha> so does that only affect you if you have servers there?
[21:13:45] <coldhead> or if the owner is based there?
[21:13:47] <coldhead> i'm not sure
[21:32:08] <cypha> instead of $("#loggedin_js").tmpl(data).appendTo("#loginarea"); is there a method that will replace the contents of #loginarea instead?
[21:35:02] <rhizmoe> cypha: html

[21:36:45] <Skillfulllbus> Hello all
[21:37:14] <Skillfulllbus> I have a query regarding jquery
[21:37:44] <Skillfulllbus> how do I access json data using jquery?
[21:38:01] <cypha> Skillfulllbus, it's in the callback function of $.ajax
[21:38:49] <Skillfulllbus> I'm trying that but I'm not able to fetch it. Moreover I want to use it in template api
[21:39:28] <Skillfulllbus> should i share the json value?
[21:39:44] <cypha> $("#template_id").tmpl(data).appendTo("#targetdiv")
[21:40:13] <cypha> or target whatever
[21:41:29] <Skillfulllbus> ok
[21:47:45] <Skillfulllbus> @cypha
[21:48:05] <Skillfulllbus> Here is the link to the json object and the jquery template http://jsfiddle.net/tijivarghese/nqCfm/
[21:49:18] <cypha> sorry, I haven't worked with nested json stuff yet
[21:49:51] <cypha> you can try just using activity as a variable
[21:50:07] <cypha> and then activity.date.event
[21:50:10] <cypha> or whatever

[22:14:33] <Kimbo> Hi... when I use $.post, my php server no longer recognises the request as a POST type.  Any ideas?
[22:18:25] <Kimbo> Anyone?
[22:19:11] <coldhead> your server is being naughty
[22:19:24] <coldhead> post() sends a bona fide POST request
[22:19:35] <coldhead> would you care to paste your JS somewhere?
[22:20:03] <cypha> haha
[22:21:20] <Kimbo> coldhead, where can I post it?
[22:21:48] <Es0teric> alright, i have this and it doesnt work.. http://pastie.org/private/galasgtarcpiwrsvdgma <--- for some reason, the event to click and show the black overlay works but to click the same element and remove the black overlay doesnt

[22:25:47] <bbk> hi
[22:25:57] <ndss56> hi
[22:26:16] <bbk> animate({top:top}); is adding the top to its initial top offset in firefox
[22:26:58] <coldhead> Kimbo: try posting something simpler, just for testing
[22:27:11] <bbk> it is working fine in chrome and IE
[22:27:26] <coldhead> replace the serialize thing with {foo:666, bar:'aids'}
[22:27:29] <coldhead> or similar
[22:27:33] <coldhead> and see if that POSTs
[22:28:21] <Kimbo> coldhead: I was mistaken.  It is recognising as a post.  I obviously have some other problem on the server side...  Thanks!
[22:28:35] <coldhead> ah good luck Kimbo

[22:56:33] <humorous> hi.  does jquery have a stack data structure or i have to use one of its plugins?
[22:57:46] <coldhead> you can't just use arrays, humorous ?

[22:58:11] <mydoghasworms> Has anyone else come across the problem of a dialog not showing when you do an ajax call in IE 8?
[22:58:25] <coldhead> certainly not, mydoghasworms
[22:58:34] <mydoghasworms> coldhead: It seems I am not alone: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6991621/jquery-dialog-is-not-displayed-with-ajax-in-the-ie
[22:58:45] <mydoghasworms> It works in FF.
[22:58:50] <coldhead> ajax and a dialog should be very much unrelated
[22:58:58] <mydoghasworms> You would think so, yes.
[22:59:50] <mydoghasworms> I tried even with just a plain div that I show before firing off the ajax call, and it exhibits the same behaviour.
[22:59:53] <coldhead> are you using the same kind of beforeSend technique?
[23:00:08] <coldhead> right, so it's not dialog related :)
[23:00:10] <mydoghasworms> No, I am just showing the dialog prior to making the call.
[23:00:20] <coldhead> paste us your code?
[23:00:22] <coldhead> ?p @ mydoghasworms
[23:00:22] <bot-t> mydoghasworms, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:00:37] <mydoghasworms> But do you have IE8?
[23:00:57] <mydoghasworms> Because it does not appear in other browsers.
[23:02:06] <mydoghasworms> OK, give me about 5-10 minutes to try set it up on jsfiddle.
[23:03:17] <mydoghasworms> coldhead: Do you know of any service on the internet I can call that would take a few seconds to execute?
[23:04:34] <coldhead> most of the AJAX methods on the site i am working on :\
[23:04:44] <coldhead> no i can't think of any immediately
[23:04:54] <coldhead> also you can't ajax call to a remote domain
[23:04:59] <coldhead> so that won't help you
[23:05:30] <dismist> yah u can
[23:05:44] <coldhead> oh, i withdraw that then
[23:05:58] <coldhead> you can mock AJAX on jsfiddle but i have no experience with it
[23:06:10] <coldhead> you might be able to simulate a delay with that
[23:06:20] <mydoghasworms> Let me check the docs/examples on jsfiddle.
[23:06:27] <mydoghasworms> Make that 10-20 minutes...
[23:07:04] <mydoghasworms> Duh. There is a whole section in the sidebar labeled "Testing Ajax requests" :-)
[23:07:23] <coldhead> good old jsfiddle
[23:07:40] <coldhead> i won't even test in ie9, mydoghasworms, i just want to check that it looks sane
[23:10:20] <mydoghasworms> OK, in that case let me just create a paste somewhere.
[23:10:32] <dismist> u ever consider de-wormin that motherfucker?
[23:10:45] <mydoghasworms> dismist: You are dismissed.
[23:11:16] <dismist> take care of that dog motherfucker
[23:15:40] <coldhead> now now
[23:16:21] <dismist> dismiss deez nuts motherfucker
[23:23:36] <sasori> question: what could possibly is the problem with jquery datepicker when I click the input form, the datepicker appears, and after i chose a date, the box calendar still is there
[23:23:48] <sasori> unless i tick somwehere in thes screen to get rid of it
[23:24:07] <dismist> sounds like the intended functionality
[23:24:40] <sasori> but after I chose a date, the calendar box, stays there
[23:25:21] <coldhead> if the demos don't do that, you may have an extra event handler which is catching the click and ignoring it
[23:25:44] <sasori> ok..need to dig..thanks
[23:25:45] <dismist> why does acrobat update 19 times a day
[23:26:11] <coldhead> because they make it a better product 19 times a day
[23:26:15] <coldhead> you should thank them!
[23:26:27] <dismist> i fucking hate them for making that program
[23:27:07] <mydoghasworms> dismist: Why don't you use Evince?
[23:29:29] <dismist> i hate pdfs
[23:29:35] <mydoghasworms> coldhead: Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/FDVGB/ I think you will find it to be quite sane. As usual, however, I can't replicate the problem, because running it like this in IE works, but I am doing exactly the same in my app.
[23:29:36] <dismist> why dont you deworm your dog
[23:30:08] <mydoghasworms> Because my dog does not get worms 19 times a day.
[23:30:29] <sasori> i noticed my problem is only occurring on IE browser :(
[23:30:33] <dismist> adobe would deworm the fuck out of it if it did
[23:30:37] <sasori> any idea how to fix it ?
[23:30:44] <dismist> you know why? because they make shit better
[23:30:45] <mydoghasworms> sasori: Welcome to the club!
[23:31:11] <dismist> youre watching your dog die out of laziness
[23:31:35] <dismist> at least vick made it quick and glorious for them to die like gladiators
[23:32:06] <dismist> i think he even drowned/electrocuted some of the poor performing ones
[23:39:22] <sasori> hi, just wanna ask if , that recursive popping of the calendar box of jquery datepicker only happens in IE at your ends ?
[23:43:19] <mydoghasworms> sasori: Sorry, I don't have a problem with the calendar, but like you, I have a problem that only happens in IE.
[23:43:49] <mydoghasworms>  /s/calendar/datepicker/
[23:45:07] <coldhead> mydoghasworms: that is seriously uncontroversial, you're right
[23:45:07] <sasori> ok
[23:45:16] <coldhead> what jQUery version are you using?
[23:45:23] <coldhead> and does using the latest make any difference?
[23:47:05] <mydoghasworms> 1.6.1. I haven't tried a newer version, because I am using lots of plugins and I am likely to break something if I do.
[23:47:37] <mydoghasworms> I actually thought of reverting to 1.5.something, because I am half sure it used to work there.
[23:48:00] <mydoghasworms> My only problem is that I can't see on jQuery UI what the supported jQuery version is for each jQuery UI version.
[23:49:43] <coldhead> yeah i just wanted to make sure you were out of the 1.4s
[23:49:53] <coldhead> in the land of the new .ajax()
[23:57:05] <mattyh88> hey, i'd like to do the following: http://pastebin.com/PxCbBkvU but this doesn't work in IE, it does in FF en chrome
[23:57:46] <mattyh88> ( i is declared of course)
