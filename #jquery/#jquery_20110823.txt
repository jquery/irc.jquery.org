[00:01:29] <cheshair> hi! i have a table with rows that can collapse or expand when i click on them (some kind of accordion then). here comes the code: http://dpaste.com/600936/ the point is that all my rows expand or collapse simultaneously; on the contrary i would like to select only the row i click on; is this possible?
[00:02:25] <Cork> cheshair: try $(this).find('.expandable').slideDown()
[00:02:45] <Cork> s/slideDown/slideToggle/
[00:03:05] <cheshair> cork, i just ran into another kind person with the very same name on another chan :-)
[00:03:14] <Cork> nope :)
[00:03:17] <cheshair> cork, i'll check it out immediately
[00:03:47] <hrwath> maybe it was Corn or Fork?
[00:04:30] <Cork> forkMe huh? :D
[00:04:38] <cheshair> Cork, it works like a charm! thanks!!!
[00:04:52] <Cork> np :)
[00:15:28] <Guest95139> Hello, is it possible to add callbacks to arbitrary functions? I would like to take any function which I know animates an Element and add my callback to this function.
[00:15:56] <coldhead> animate takes a callback, would that work?
[00:16:34] <Cork> Guest95139: to answer you'r question, no javascript functions don't have a default handle of callbacks
[00:16:37] <Guest95139> coldhead: I think not, because I'm receiving the function after it was written
[00:16:40] <Cork> the function has to handle it them self
[00:16:49] <Guest95139> ok
[00:17:41] <Guest95139> do you think it would be possible to make animation functions return deferred objects?
[00:17:52] <Guest95139> (then one could add arbitrary callbacks I think)
[00:19:19] <Cork> Guest95139: lets backup a but
[00:19:24] <Cork> *bit
[00:19:32] <Cork> sigh
[00:19:47] <Cork> Guest95139: to start with could you take a simpler nick name=
[00:19:51] <Guest95139> sorry
[00:19:58] <Cork> /nick <new nick>
[00:20:08] <coldhead> sup pangel
[00:20:34] <Cork> pangel: is it ok, to get notified when the function is run?
[00:20:50] <Cork> and do you have a way to find these functions?
[00:21:01] <pangel> Unless you also get to know the exact duration of the animation, no.
[00:21:38] <Cork> then i think you might be out of luck
[00:22:20] <pangel> I won't find these functions, no. The goal is to have objects define their own animations, but pass those functions to a global "animation handling" objects which will add teardowns at the end of the animations.
[00:24:22] <Cork> *WEEEE*... http://developers.slashdot.org/story/11/08/22/2332217/Serious-Crypto-Bug-Found-In-PHP-537
[00:24:43] <Cork> why have unit tests if you don't run them >_<
[00:33:49] <danieliser> how can i do something similar to delagate but without an event.. so that new items with class button get initialized when they enter the dom tree?
[00:34:11] <pangel> Cork: the solution is to use el.promise().done(...)
[00:35:19] <yan__nick> Hey guys, I have something like '<span id="prev-123">Previous</span>' - How can I get the 123?
[00:35:31] <yan__nick> With .replace() ?
[00:35:45] <juha_> Cork: ehh.. gg php team
[00:37:11] <coldhead> ? $('<span id="prev-123" />).attr('id')
[00:37:12] <bot-t> coldhead, .hide() - Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[00:37:16] <coldhead> ?eval $('<span id="prev-123" />).attr('id')
[00:37:17] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[00:37:19] <juha_> hey coldie!
[00:37:24] <coldhead> ?eval $('<span id="prev-123" />').attr('id')
[00:37:24] <bot-t> coldhead: TypeError: div is undefined
[00:37:29] <coldhead> OH FUCK YOU BOT
[00:37:40] <juha_> coldhead: i missed you yesterday, i had something funny to say to you, but can't remember it anymore, so fuck you
[00:38:10] <coldhead> yan__nick: var the_num = $('<span id="prev-123" />').attr('id').match(/(\d+)/)[1]
[00:38:13] <coldhead> something like that
[00:38:21] <coldhead> thanks for that juha_
[00:38:25] <juha_> <3
[00:38:26] <coldhead> it sounds great
[00:38:33] <Cork> yan__nick: $elm.attr('id').split('-')[1]
[00:38:50] <coldhead> mine is more robust, Cork
[00:38:52] <yan__nick> thanks coldhead  and Cork
[00:39:04] <coldhead> but thanks to cork's law: ALWAYS DO WHATEVER CORK SAYS
[00:39:33] <Cork> coldhead: sure it is, never said it wasn't :)
[00:39:38] <coldhead> Cork's law is like Cork's love
[00:39:41] <coldhead> hard and fast
[00:39:45] <juha_> :D
[00:39:52] <Cork> coldhead: the question might be if its needed
[00:40:00] <Cork> and split is faster then the regex match
[00:40:33] <coldhead> pfft, speed speed speed
[00:40:47] <coldhead> i remember when we measured CPU speed in megahertz
[00:41:10] <danieliser> how can i do something similar to delagate but without an event.. so that new items with class button get initialized when they enter the dom tree?
[00:42:16] <danieliser> or do i have to reinitialize any content that gets loaded via ajax?
[00:43:44] <yan__nick> Can I bind a click event in an .each() function=
[00:43:46] <yan__nick> ?
[00:43:59] <aaronmcadam> yea
[00:44:29] <aaronmcadam> are you trying to attach click handlers to a group of elements yan__nick
[00:44:29] <yan__nick> aaronmcadam: $elm.each(function() { $(".bar").click(function() { ... }); }); ?
[00:44:42] <yan__nick> aaronmcadam: no
[00:44:52] <blackspotwiggins> yan__nick, why would you bind the same function over and over again
[00:45:01] <aaronmcadam> looks like you are
[00:45:07] <yan__nick> blackspotwiggins: because i need a var which is in my gallery
[00:45:07] <aaronmcadam> use delegate for that
[00:45:13] <danieliser> every time you clicked it you would get the results many times
[00:45:15] <blackspotwiggins> ???
[00:45:35] <aaronmcadam> rethink your solution there
[00:46:12] <danieliser> how can i initialize new .buttons without having to call $('.buttons').buttons(); every time i load new content?
[00:46:24] <danieliser> similar to delegate but no event..
[00:46:34] <Cork> danieliser: you can't
[00:47:15] <Cork> danieliser: you could create a wrapper function that does it for you if you like
[00:47:26] <danieliser> Cork: so i need to call $('buttons).button(); any way to only apply it to those not already applied to
[00:48:00] <Cork> danieliser: you can filter out by the class added by jquery-ui
[00:48:22] <danieliser> Cork: brilliant.. didnt even consider that.. thanks..
[00:48:31] <Cork> danieliser: $('button:not(.ui-button)')
[00:52:33] <Rinthe> what does .src do?
[00:52:51] <aaronmcadam> that's not a method
[00:53:04] <aaronmcadam> just a property
[00:53:09] <courpse> I've a tree that starts off expanded, every branch as a class of branch, and a class of branch_X.
[00:53:48] <Myx0x3> Hey, i need some help.. http://pastebin.com/K4UCRJFW i want to toggle each div, but seems problem to toggle id's? the ID's is generated by PHP so i have no static control over them..
[00:53:59] <courpse> I have $('.branch').toggle(); but only the first instance of branch is toggled, when i open the brnach, the rest is already expanded,.
[00:54:19] <courpse> Any points on what to look for?
[00:54:50] <oquidave> hello i want to show hide an item dropdown menu on click by user using jquery...here is my sample code.THANKS.. http://pastebin.com/aPgfvbLF
[00:58:24] <yan__nick> Hello again :) How can I get "slideshows" in my two click functions? http://pastebin.com/pseYKYLA
[01:03:05] <Cork> yan__nick: its in the parent scope, so just use it
[01:03:14] <Cork> (as your already doing)
[01:03:23] <yan__nick> Cork: but my current code doesn't work
[01:03:32] <yan__nick> i cannot get the slideshows variable in my .click function
[01:04:04] <Cork> cause its not slideshow, but slideshows
[01:04:30] <yan__nick> fail
[01:05:17] <yan__nick> Cork: fuck Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'cycle' of undefined  :c
[01:05:48] <Cork> yan__nick: what does console.log(slideshows); show you?
[01:05:58] <yan__nick> Cork: all slideshows as id
[01:06:01] <Cork> (ex. if you call it before the "prev" call)
[01:06:18] <Cork> yan__nick: ya, but check that the object exists and is what you expect
[01:07:09] <yan__nick> Cork: yeah the object is filled, but first thanks for your help
[01:07:13] <yan__nick> i'm on my on way now ;D
[01:07:48] <Cork> yan__nick: then next do console.log(slideshows[id])
[01:07:57] <Myx0x3> is it possible to toggle an div with the same id as the A link?
[01:08:12] <blackspotwiggins> Myx0x3, two elements can not have same ids
[01:08:18] <yan__nick> Cork: ah! .parent().parent()
[01:08:28] <Cork> :)
[01:08:38] <yan__nick> Cork++
[01:09:34] <Myx0x3> blackspotwiggins: how should i do it then? with classes?
[01:09:47] <blackspotwiggins> that's one option
[01:10:02] <Myx0x3> but how do you get your A class "id" then?
[01:10:34] <Myx0x3> ($'.'+id)?
[01:10:59] <blackspotwiggins> that syntax most likely will not work
[01:11:03] <Cork> Myx0x3: use data-
[01:11:14] <Cork> give the alink the id of the relative div in there
[01:12:11] <blackspotwiggins> or, #divid  as href
[01:12:24] <Myx0x3> like this? http://pastebin.com/h7SAHaGD
[01:13:04] <Cork> Myx0x3: <a class="toggle" href="" data-id="b10"> $('.toggle').click(function() { $('#' + $(this).data('id')).toggle() });
[01:13:45] <Myx0x3> aha! ill try that.. have to change all PHP..
[01:14:20] <Myx0x3> JS or jquery is not my best side, hehe
[01:15:41] <kitikonti> anyone knows why in this code only in ie9 the line 21 dont work? if i remove the setTimout it will work. http://pastebin.com/WuUwY9Yq
[01:16:40] <madprops> is there an official way to make ajax file uploads?
[01:17:06] <Cork> madprops: only in newer browsers
[01:17:11] <blackspotwiggins> madprops, formdata
[01:17:16] <Cork> madprops: with older browser theres only hacks
[01:18:03] <madprops> sounds good
[01:18:06] <Myx0x3> Cork: btw, the divs are more then one, i dont think ID is an option there.. is it the same but ill just change # for .?
[01:18:25] <blackspotwiggins> with older browsers its either iframe porn or getAsBinary() stuff
[01:18:33] <Cork> Myx0x3: sure (but change data-id to data-class or something)
[01:18:48] <madprops> blackspotwiggins, i cant find anything about formdata
[01:19:12] <blackspotwiggins> ?lmgtfy formdata @ madprops
[01:19:13] <bot-t> madprops, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=formdata
[01:19:24] <Myx0x3> Cork: $(this).data('id') -> $(this).class('id') and data-class instead of data-id?
[01:19:33] <kitikonti> anyone an idea?
[01:19:39] <Myx0x3> ooh, sorry $(this).data('class') **
[01:19:45] <Cork> ya
[01:22:09] <courpse> Does jsfiddle support jquery?
[01:22:17] <ravenzz> of course
[01:22:29] <courpse> yeah, my bad, didnt see the framework stuff.
[01:22:46] <courpse> http://jsfiddle.net/3uuPr/
[01:23:19] <courpse> Why does it start off detracted, But all the rest are still open after clicking the first 'invitees: 1' button?
[01:23:32] <courpse> Like, it should close every branch.
[01:25:06] <Rinthe> http://codepad.org/FiNRH1nl sometimes when I go to a new image. and click .zoom (hotkeyed) too fast, the image will show off centered (css positions not applied to them) any idea why that is?
[01:27:07] <Rinthe> it's not that I click too fast anymore. it seems to be off centered the first time i click it
[01:27:16] <Rinthe> i turn it off and click it again, it's centered
[01:30:08] <duttons> hi all.. I have just invested in a new jqm plugin but it seems to have a problem with rotation.. you seem to have to swipe the screen before it detects the rotation has changed.. any ideas or any good code snippets for orientation?
[01:31:23] <Rinthe> anyone?
[01:32:59] <madprops> did jquery-ui merge with jquery or is it still a separate library?
[01:34:22] <Woet> it's separate.
[01:35:00] <Narhir> can I somehow convert a "normal input field" trough jquery and make it a "upload file input field" ?
[01:35:41] <courpse> $('.class').attr('type', 'file'); perhaps?
[01:36:24] <Cork> Narhir: most browsers will not allow you to do that
[01:36:51] <Haprog> you can replace an input field with another though
[01:36:56] <anli_> Is there a dropdown plugin in jquery ide?
[01:36:59] <Haprog> or any other element
[01:37:06] <Cork> yup
[01:37:22] <anli_> eh, jquery ui
[01:37:27] <Cork> anli_: its in the making, but not in release yet
[01:37:38] <Rinthe> http://codepad.org/FiNRH1nl sometimes when I go to a new image. and click .zoom (hotkeyed) for the first time, the image will show off centered (css positions not applied to them). I close it and open .zoom again, it'll be centered. any idea why that is?
[01:37:46] <Cork> anli_: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/selectmenu/index.html
[01:38:00] <courpse> http://jsfiddle.net/3uuPr/ How come only the first div with class branch toggles, but the rest stay open? after opening it back up (Clicking on the Invites: X grayed out item,)
[01:38:13] <anli_> ah, yeah, that link
[01:38:47] <courpse> About 8 of em have divs with class 'branch' and only 1 toggles when using $('.branch').toggle();
[01:38:48] <courpse> :/
[01:41:52] <rhandom2> trying to work away several jquery not defined issues, probably caused by jscript conflicts. Trying to add jQueryNoConflict to http://jsfiddle.net/rhand_js/6L7h9/
[01:41:56] <rhandom2> no luck yet
[01:42:08] <Cork> courpse: class is a reserved word
[01:42:23] <courpse> Hummf.
[01:42:43] <rhandom2> tried an alias, general jQuery.noConflict(); .. still jquery not defined in same function
[01:43:10] <Rinthe> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1944280/determine-original-size-of-image-cross-browser anyone know how i can use this function?
[01:43:13] <Rinthe> does it return anything?
[01:43:24] <courpse> Cork, No difference with it changed.
[01:44:04] <Woet> Rinthe: .width should work fine
[01:44:21] <Rinthe> Woet: not when you only have an image URL
[01:44:37] <Woet> Rinthe: is there a reason you want to do that client side instead of server side?
[01:44:58] <Rinthe> Woet: http://codepad.org/FiNRH1nl sometimes when I go to a new image. and click .zoom (hotkeyed) for the first time, the image will show off centered (css positions not applied to them). I close it and open .zoom again, it'll be centered. any idea why that is?
[01:45:32] <Rinthe> I think it's acuse im getting the image width height from somethign that doesn't exist yet thats why it only works the second time
[01:46:05] <courpse> Cork, The callback function on toggle() should trigger for each item toggled? or for the whole call as one?
[01:46:44] <cheshair> hi! i have some issues with expandible rows in a table: http://dpaste.com/600980/ expanding doesn't work, any tips? (a bit different from what i asked a few minutes ago)
[01:46:56] <courpse> Humm, for each, and that does trigger correctly.
[01:47:13] <courpse> :(
[01:47:30] <cheshair> i guess i have to properly use next or a similar method
[01:47:37] <courpse> I'm guessing that when clicking the first branch, if there are other toggled branches inside, its opening them to make em viewable.
[01:48:38] <rhandom2> how can I add a working noconflict option to http://jsfiddle.net/rhand_js/6L7h9/ ?
[01:49:00] <Rinthe> anybody?
[01:55:25] <ravenzz> Rinthe did you try load()?
[01:56:02] <Rinthe> ravenzz: I think i got it to work
[01:56:08] <Rinthe> im not too sure exactly what it does tho
[01:56:11] <Rinthe> load()
[01:56:33] <Rinthe> my problem is that the image sizes are zero because they haven't loaded yet the first time
[01:56:47] <ravenzz> yup
[01:56:55] <ravenzz> ?load @ Rinthe
[01:56:55] <bot-t> Rinthe, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[01:57:02] <Rinthe> this forces the wait for image to load or something?
[01:57:18] <Myx0x3> how come this not work? http://pastebin.com/C2DAAASy i want the text to change after i show it, and change again when i hide it..
[01:57:27] <ravenzz> The load event is sent to an element when it and all sub-elements have been completely loaded. This event can be sent to any element associated with a URL: images, scripts, frames, iframes, and the window object.
[01:57:29] <kaputtmacher> hi all
[01:57:59] <ravenzz> Rinthe it is an event handler
[01:58:11] <Rinthe> revenzz: i see. but here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1944280/determine-original-size-of-image-cross-browser
[01:58:28] <ravenzz> e.g. $('img').load(function() { alert('wow is loaded') });
[01:58:29] <Rinthe> revenzz: wait.. thats just javascript
[02:04:21] <mazzachre> Is it possible to stop an ajax call from being redirected? Say the resource I request sends a 302 "somewhere", but instead of automatically loading that "somewhere" with another ajax request it stops and let me handle that situation?
[02:04:21] <blackspotwiggins> mazzachre, webkit redirects automatically, firefox doesnt IIRC
[02:04:21] <blackspotwiggins> until firefox 6 or 7 that is
[02:04:21] <mazzachre> Hmmm... and I can't stop webkit from doing it? Or new firefox etc?
[02:04:21] <blackspotwiggins> no
[02:04:23] <blackspotwiggins> don't think so
[02:04:30] <mazzachre> Damned... that was stupid :(
[02:04:54] <mazzachre> So I have to make 2 different backend handlers for ajax calls and posts based on browser capability for such :(
[02:05:24] <blackspotwiggins> just dont respond with 302?
[02:05:33] <blackspotwiggins> if you have xhr
[02:05:53] <mazzachre> blackspotwiggins: Ya.. but then what to do for browsers that don't do ajax? Like mobile IE?
[02:07:33] <Rinthe> ravenzz: is this possible, IMG_URL.load(function() { alert('wow is loaded') });
[02:09:08] <ravenzz> you should bind the event on an element
[02:09:21] <ravenzz> read the documentation
[02:09:45] <Rinthe> hm
[02:09:58] <blackspotwiggins> mazzachre, you can determine if the request is xhr on the server side.
[02:15:39] <dwarf_code_red_X> hi
[02:15:45] <dwarf_code_red_X> is it possible to use JQ to select a dropdown option?
[02:16:54] <JKarsrud> sure, set the value of the dropdown?
[02:17:01] <anli_> Hm, seems like I cannot choose anything in theme roller anymore
[02:17:14] <anli_> What is included? All?
[02:17:24] <anli_> Ah, sorry, found it
[02:19:51] <JKarsrud> dwarf_code_red_X: http://jsfiddle.net/dEbPf/
[02:20:31] <mazzachre> blackspotwiggins: Oh.. how?
[02:21:41] <blackspotwiggins> mazzachre, xhr sets certain headers
[02:21:58] <blackspotwiggins> surprised that you do ajax without knowing stuff like that
[02:22:24] <mazzachre> blackspotwiggins: I don't normally do frontend work... but suddenly is needed to :s
[02:24:32] <brianpWins> how do you debug a really deep error? I'm getting an uncaught syntax error but it's wicked deep in the jquery library
[02:25:20] <mazzachre> X-Requested-With is that always set? By all browsers?
[02:28:11] <anli_> Hm, cant find jquery ui selectmenu in theme-roller
[02:28:14] <anli_> Should it be there?
[02:29:09] <blackspotwiggins> mazzachre, it is set by jquery
[02:29:34] <mazzachre> brianpWins: Normally that means you are giving wrong arguments... I have not seen that so far.. but get the development version then, it is not minified, so easier to debug
[02:29:35] <blackspotwiggins> brianpWins, you go up the stack trace until you find a line with your code
[02:29:59] <anli_> What? Does jquery add a custom header?
[02:31:20] <brianpWins> hmm the stack it's giving me is only 3 traces none of which is mine. I have no doubt it's something I'm passing in wrong somewhere. but oddly enough everything is working it's just really bugging me seeing the error in the console
[02:33:43] <Myx0x3> how can i change text with toggle and not "forget" the old text?
[02:34:14] <brianpWins> Myx0x3: manually store the original text first
[02:34:24] <Myx0x3> brianpWins: how?
[02:35:00] <brianpWins> Myx0x3: depends on what your toggling i suppose
[02:36:07] <Myx0x3> brianpWins: http://pastebin.com/Mat0yvj5 i want it to change after it toggles..
[02:36:26] <Myx0x3> i want the text to toggle*
[02:37:02] <Myx0x3> and i cant set the text static couse it some php loops involved.. and this is outside the php..
[02:38:53] <loris> any reliable way to trigger an event when the browser window gets focus (ie: switched back from another tab) ?
[02:39:43] <oquidave_> hello can i specify more than one class for an event handleer like $(".class1, .class2, class3").mouseleave(function(("this").hide();))
[02:39:44] <brianpWins> Myx0x3: you'd do something like
[02:40:15] <brianpWins> var oldNmae = <? $myPHPVariableName ?>
[02:40:20] <brianpWins> before you toggle it
[02:40:35] <brianpWins> so whatever the php is about to call get stored as a JS variable
[02:41:02] <apollo13> hi, is there a page which describes the event types that are available for $.live?
[02:41:27] <apollo13> essentially I am looking for an event when a element is added to the dom
[02:42:07] <Myx0x3> brianpWins: i can't do that.. the PHP is sperate from the Jquery
[02:42:21] <Myx0x3> separate*
[02:42:25] <brianpWins> Myx0x3: then how are you getting the php variables into the toggle names anyway
[02:42:40] <brianpWins> you have to cross paths at some point. wherever that is. store it in a js variab;e
[02:43:51] <anli_> What is "ThemeRoller ready"?
[02:44:06] <Myx0x3> ill use data-classes witch sets an "id" and jquery takes that and toggles it.. maybe i can set name="" in the div and use it inside jquery?
[02:44:35] <apollo13> anli_: I guess the plugin uses classes which conform to http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[02:45:25] <Cork> Myx0x3: i don't think i explained one thing before, theres a reason i used data- attributes
[02:46:09] <Cork> Myx0x3: and thats cause thats a reserved attribute prefix in html5, so it won't ever conflict with other attributes
[02:46:39] <Myx0x3> Cork: but can i send more then one thing with it? couse i already sends an "id"
[02:47:05] <Cork> Myx0x3: your not really sending anything, its just a prefix
[02:47:12] <Cork> you can use it how many times you want
[02:47:26] <Cork> data-1="" data-name="" data-something=""
[02:47:50] <cheshair> Cork, do you happen to know how to solve this? http://dpaste.com/600980/
[02:47:55] <Myx0x3> couse i want it to say "show more from $PHPSHIT" and when i click show more.. it toggles.. and change text to hide, and when i click hide it toggles and change back to Show more from..
[02:48:03] <anli_> apollo13: hm, found it on github, but the styles seems fubared
[02:48:06] <anli_> https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui/tree/selectmenu/ui
[02:48:31] <Cork> cheshair: its .next() not .next
[02:48:34] <Myx0x3> Cork: aha! cool! well ill use that
[02:48:45] <anli_> Maybe I also have to download the styles :)
[02:48:49] <Myx0x3> Cork: i thougt i coulnt use more then id and class, hehe
[02:48:55] <apollo13> anli_: that's a fork of jquery-ui and as such probably expected to be broken sometimes
[02:48:56] <Cork> :D
[02:49:08] <anli_> aha
[02:49:20] <Cork> Myx0x3: anything starting with data- is free for the taking :)
[02:49:23] <anli_> hm, uses an old jquery.js...
[02:49:28] <anli_> must try
[02:49:34] <apollo13> anli_: I would try official jquery ui releases
[02:49:45] <Myx0x3> Cork: cool :) and IE6 -> IE8 hates it?
[02:50:25] <cheshair> cork, thanks! it works now! (even though it doesn't show any slide behaviour... it suddenly collapse and shows some graphical imperfection some of the borders width change)
[02:50:39] <anli_> But that selectmenu seems interesting
[02:50:54] <Cork> cheshair: you can't do all that much on table rows/cells
[02:51:59] <cheshair> Cork: really? how am i supposed to do? throw away table stuff and only rely on divs?
[02:52:02] <Cork> Myx0x3: the cool thing about it is its backwards compatible
[02:52:14] <noob> any one how can i correct this  http://jsfiddle.net/Dxsuq/2/
[02:52:15] <noob> ?
[02:52:19] <Cork> Myx0x3: and validators ok with it as long as you use the html5 doctype
[02:52:27] <Cork> <!doctype html>
[02:52:44] <Myx0x3> Cork: okay, cool!
[02:53:00] <noob> http://jsfiddle.net/Dxsuq/2/   i am trying to addcolumns and delete columns here  can anyone look into the problem please
[02:53:09] <fRAiLtY-> Hi guys, I've got a form I'm trying to replace the submit button with a loading image with, it doesn't seem to be working though. Can anyone help? http://pastie.org/2416000
[02:53:33] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: don't dubble post
[02:53:37] <Cork> ask in one channel at a time
[02:54:10] <fRAiLtY-> Well as I got it off stackoverflow, I'm not sure whether it's relevant to jQuery or general Java, hence why I asked twice.
[02:54:17] <noob> the error is addColumns is not defined
[02:54:22] <noob> how can i correct it
[02:54:26] <noob>  any idea?
[02:54:46] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: still ask in one channel, wait for some answers; if none, ask in the other channel
[02:54:52] <Cork> but give it a few minutes at lest
[02:54:55] <Cork> *least
[02:55:12] <noob> okay Cork can you answer my question?
[02:56:22] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: give the form an id, and replace $("mail") with $('#<your id>')
[02:56:31] <krz> how do i get the value of an item that was selected in a select element?
[02:56:56] <Cork> krz: $('select').val()
[02:57:17] <krz> thanks
[02:57:44] <noob> is my question very noob or is it very tough...cause i am not getting answers for it :P
[02:57:51] <noob> i guess its very noob
[02:58:12] <ravenzz> can you ask again? i wasn't here
[02:58:26] <noob> http://jsfiddle.net/Dxsuq/2/
[02:58:29] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Submit button disappears, no image appears
[02:58:45] <formers> fRAiLtY-: why do you use .one ?
[02:58:47] <noob> i am not able to add columns, error is addcolumn is not defined
[02:58:50] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/2416000
[02:59:00] <fRAiLtY-> formers: Not sure, copied it from stackoverflow
[02:59:04] <ravenzz> noob this is plain javascript
[02:59:07] <ravenzz> not jquery
[02:59:16] <noob> okay
[02:59:52] <noob> i tried doing something like this using jquery as well but to no use
[02:59:56] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: do you have a live site?
[02:59:58] <formers> frality: it will unbind itself hanve;t seen anyone use it in this way
[02:59:59] <Cork> that should work
[03:00:19] <fRAiLtY-> http://www.blackwellprint.co.uk/send/
[03:00:35] <fRAiLtY-> formers: It's meant to stop the form being re-submitted whilst it's loading apparently?
[03:01:45] <krz> i get syntax error with total = (.25 * 10%) + .25;
[03:01:47] <krz> why so?
[03:02:16] <Cork> krz: 0.25 not .25
[03:02:34] <NiLon> 10% ehem?
[03:02:44] <NiLon> you have no second operator for that mod
[03:02:55] <krz> Cork: still the same result
[03:03:20] <NiLon> total = (0.25 * 0.1) + 0.25;
[03:03:37] <krz> thanks that works
[03:03:42] <formers> frality: its working for me
[03:03:49] <ilon> hey, stop the hilight
[03:04:03] <NiLon> wut
[03:04:06] <formers> the only thing is that loading of the image is slower than the form submission
[03:04:25] <ilon> NiLon: i have hilight on ilon :(
[03:04:25] <dwarf_code_red_X> <JKarsrud> dwarf_code_red_X: http://jsfiddle.net/dEbPf/ <-- Thanks.
[03:04:34] <dwarf_code_red_X> I forgot my highlighting was deactivated.
[03:04:46] <NiLon> ilon hehe, but why it matches nicks?
[03:05:00] <ilon> NiLon: sloppy regexp
[03:06:02] <formers> fRAiLtY-: Instead of doing what you are, do you think you can show and hide a element instead of creating the image element
[03:06:04] <formers> ?
[03:06:58] <fRAiLtY-> I don't mind how I do it really, I just want the button to "disappear" in favour of a loading image, just for user experience. I know 0 about javascript though, I'm a php man :x hence why I used stack overflow
[03:08:02] <keirlavelle> hi, can anyone tell me if i am sending a form via ajax, is there a way in teh success callback to prevent the form from being sent again, i'm not sure why but a form I am sending is being sent multiple times on occasion
[03:08:34] <krz> why does parseInt(0.50) return 0 ?
[03:08:44] <fRAiLtY-> See anything Cork ?
[03:09:39] <krz> if i have a string '0.50' how can i implement this as an integer without rounding up or down
[03:09:46] <krz> parseInt looks like its rounding
[03:10:45] <formers> fRAiLtY-: Are you able to create the image next to the send button, with a display of none. then replace your current code of " $(":submit").replaceWith("<img src='images/loading.gif' alt='Executing...' />");" with $(":submit").css('display', 'none').siblings('#loading').css('display', 'inline-block');
[03:12:04] <ravenzz> noob http://jsfiddle.net/QBfJA/1/
[03:12:07] <formers> Or you could pre-load it somewhere else. Your problem really is that the image is loading and the form is submitng and you don't have enough time to show the effect
[03:13:20] <noob> ravenzz its not working
[03:13:25] <ravenzz> yes..
[03:13:28] <ravenzz> it work
[03:13:46] <ravenzz> did you read the comment?
[03:13:47] <krz> anyone?
[03:14:12] <fRAiLtY-> formers: At the moment that form would take 4 secs to execute anyway which should be plenty of time no? Does the image have to be contained in a div called #loading yeah?
[03:14:22] <ravenzz> noob ok look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/QBfJA/2/
[03:14:51] <formers> Frailty : doesn't really matter if it is in a div or not
[03:16:08] <fRAiLtY-> So it would work like this? <p style="text-align:center;"><input type="submit" name="submit" value="Send"> 					<img src="images/loading.gif" style="display:none;" /></p>
[03:16:21] <krz> ok parseFloat seems to work
[03:16:24] <formers> fRAiLtY-: When I tried your site, and just submitted the form I saw "Executing..." and then it went to index.php. When I placed a breakpoint and executed the code manually, the image came up in a second or two. When I placed the breakpoint after the previous breakpoint same reaction.
[03:16:49] <oquidave_> srvmax
[03:17:09] <noob> ravenz thanks was able to do that in the previous one
[03:17:14] <noob> made border =1
[03:17:42] <formers> fRAiLtY-: Yeah, if it is created at the time the form is loaded you don't have to worry about the latency for the image to load.
[03:17:43] <noob> can i also set the width for that cell as well?
[03:18:53] <formers> keirlavelle: Hi, is the form submitting twice when you are doing it or when another user (customer) is using it ?
[03:19:13] <ravenzz> noob yes, css http://jsfiddle.net/QBfJA/3/
[03:20:24] <keirlavelle> when a customer is using it
[03:20:25] <fRAiLtY-> formers: http://pastie.org/2416092 unfortunately it doesn't work, the button disappears and the script takes it's usual ~5 secs to process... no image :(
[03:20:34] <keirlavelle> formers: sorry, when a customer is using it
[03:21:29] <formers> fRAiLtY-: add id='loading' to the image tag
[03:22:46] <fRAiLtY-> Excellent, works! Thanks a bunch!
[03:23:34] <formers> keirlavelle: I had the same problem at a client not long ago, where we were making a ajax call on a form. The form was being submitted multiple times because we weren't providing feedback to the user that it has been submitted. Therefore we changed the text of submit button, disabled it so that they couldn't submit it twice. on the sucess function we re-enabled it
[03:23:46] <formers> fRAiLtY-: np
[03:24:36] <formers> keirlavelle: Or do what fRAiLtY- is doing/has done (replace the submit button with an image)
[03:25:13] <noob> ravenzz it is working now thanks
[03:25:54] <noob> http://jsfiddle.net/QBfJA/4/
[03:26:09] <formers> fRAiLtY-: I'm assuming that you are going to add further validation to that form, if you are then I wouldn't use .one since it will unbind itself. use click instead ?
[03:26:25] <formers> or rebind it
[03:26:34] <fRAiLtY-> Ok, I'm going to add validation to check fields etc yes. So just remove .one and replace with .click ?
[03:26:53] <noob> can i include a js file in fiddle?
[03:27:01] <ravenzz> yes
[03:27:13] <ravenzz> it should be hosted somewhere
[03:27:22] <formers> fRAiLtY-: .one = This method is identical to .bind(), except that the handler is unbound after its first invocation.
[03:27:24] <ravenzz> then you can include it from "Add Resources"
[03:27:40] <formers> http://api.jquery.com/one/
[03:27:58] <noob> okay..thanks for that
[03:30:49] <keirlavelle> formers: I actually have in my success callback $('#sendform').hide(); but somehow the form gets resent sometimes
[03:31:10] <keirlavelle> is there a way to actually unbind the submit function to make it impossible to resend?
[03:31:50] <formers> Yeah I suppose, .one()
[03:32:28] <fRAiLtY-> formers: That's what I'm trying to do, make it not possible to resend the form whilst it's working :o
[03:32:33] <fRAiLtY-> is .one correct then?
[03:32:58] <formers> see above for example from fRAiLtY- however, once it is unbound you would need to rebind it somewhere else.
[03:33:20] <oal> When I do $('#someinput').keypress... and call $(this).val() it doesn't show the last character I typed into the input. How to fix that?
[03:34:18] <oal> Or is there another way to get the content of the input field on any change? .change seems to only work when the user presses enter etc.
[03:34:59] <formers> fRAiLtY-: I haven't used .one before, if you do use it then once it has executed it will unbind itself so you will need to re-bind it if you want ot use it again. Both will work, however, since you have to rebind the submit to re-use it then it seems to be a waste of code
[03:37:14] <fRAiLtY-> By executed how do you mean? When the script finishes you get redirected to another page anyway?
[03:38:46] <murrrley> Hey. I'm trying to fetch json from a .js file with getJson, but can't make it work (Probably something really basic and simple..). html + .js: http://pastebin.com/2J8giqX5
[03:40:45] <mercury_> Hi. I want to get some data from blob mysql with ajax jquery and php. I get in response data in binary. How can i get data with header changed ?
[03:41:17] <keirlavelle> fRAiLtY- : do you have the same issue, preventing a form from being submitted more than once?
[03:41:56] <fRAiLtY-> I don't have an issue at the moment I don't think, just trying to avoid it. My script takes time to execute, I don't want it to be executed again whilst it's working etc
[03:42:42] <formers> fRAiLtY-: Check this out, I've done a test case : http://jsfiddle.net/22hX4/ click on the button twice
[03:43:59] <formers> sorry try this: http://jsfiddle.net/22hX4/1/
[03:45:46] <formers> If you click on it the first time it will display an alert, click ok on the alert. Then click on the alert again then nothing happens... So if you put in validation and prevent the form from being submitted then the user will not be able to submit the form
[03:46:47] <formers> sorry i meant click on the button again then nothing happens
[03:47:47] <formers> keirlavelle: : check out http://jsfiddle.net/22hX4/1/
[03:57:54] <keirlavelle> formers: aha! i've only just realised what you're saying lol ( i'm simple like that ) i've been trying to recreate the environment that the client is submitting the form multiple times to no avail and baffling myself and now I realise ( thanks to you ) that they are just hammering the submit button while the form processes lol
[04:00:15] <jorick> can someone please help me with this code? http://pastebin.com/tTt6bmHd i'm trying to set a click handler on all objects that have a certain classname
[04:01:10] <formers> keirlavelle: No problem, glad to be of help. That took me a couple of days to work out at that clients work, couldn't for the life of me figure it out since I was breaking at each point and only receiving a single entry in the database etc...
[04:01:44] <jorick> for some reason, jQuery is calling my event handler on the leaf node on which i clicked, instead of the node on which i defined the handler
[04:02:07] <sean`> OHAI
[04:02:56] <loris> jorick: just do $('.views-row .views-field-title').click(function() { console.log(this.className);}); ?
[04:03:29] <formers> jorick : haven you just tried : $('.views-row .views-field-title').click(function(){....});
[04:03:43] <formers> or what loris said
[04:04:47] <jorick> dropping the each is pretty cool… and it seems it works with "this" instead of "event.target". I could go on a little bi
[04:04:59] <jorick> whoops pasting
[04:05:00] <keirlavelle> formers: thanks for that, what would the correct point to hide the submit button, using the beforeSend callback?
[04:05:11] <sean`> Hi
[04:05:14] <sean`> can someone help my jqueries
[04:05:16] <loris> yeah avoid each, jquery selectors are way more performant here
[04:05:38] <formers> keirlavelle:  yeah
[04:06:03] <keirlavelle> formers: thanks man much appreciated, its been doing my head in all these duplicates i've been getting
[04:06:04] <formers> sean`: you cna probably help yourself
[04:06:15] <formers> no problem
[04:10:40] <NoReGreT> if i want an <a href='..'> to not go there, i just return? or is there something else
[04:13:33] <juha_> formers: no need to be rude, it's most likely sean's first day
[04:14:26] <formers> juha_: sean` used to help me
[04:14:38] <formers> in this chan
[04:14:55] <juha_> oh, really
[04:15:03] <juha_> so, it's his second day?
[04:15:17] <formers> unless its a different sean`
[04:15:35] <_|Nix|_> Hi! I have canvas = $("<canvas/>", { width: 256, height: 256 }).text("Colour picker canvas"); ... now, how do I call getContext("2d") so I can actually draw something? I've tried var context = canvas.get().getContext("2d"); but that gives me "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object HTMLCanvasElement] has no method named 'getContext' ...
[04:16:33] <jorick> $("<canvas/>") works? i'd say it needs to be $("canvas"), no?
[04:16:40] <jorick> (i'm pretty new to this too)
[04:16:53] <formers> Noregret: sorry, where don't you want it to go ? Are you saying that you have a link <a href="secondPage.html">mylink</a> and if someone clicks on it then it shouldn't go to secondPage.html ?
[04:17:03] <NoReGreT> formers: right
[04:17:10] <Cork> jorick: use [0]
[04:17:18] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[04:17:23] <_|Nix|_> jorick: I want to create a new canvas element.
[04:17:26] <NoReGreT> formers: is 'return' sufficient ?
[04:17:31] <_Rui_> hello, I'm using jQuery Mobile and I need to refresh a list, where exactly should I invoke the "refresh()" function?
[04:17:42] <_|Nix|_> jorick: That's how you do it - pretty sure ...
[04:18:50] <Cork> _|Nix|_: have you appended the canvas on the dom?
[04:19:35] <formers> NoReGreT: yeah it is
[04:20:12] <NoReGreT> formers: but is there another method for that? since i remember that i did it before differently
[04:21:03] <formers> NoReGreT: you could have something like this <a href="secondpage.html" id="asd">link</a> and script $("#asd").click(function(){return false;});
[04:21:12] <formers> There's other ways to do it as well
[04:21:25] <_|Nix|_> Cork: I don't think so ...
[04:21:31] <_|Nix|_> Cork: Do I need to?
[04:21:55] <Cork> _|Nix|_: many properties fail to work on element not connected to the dom
[04:21:59] <Cork> so ya, try that
[04:22:04] <_|Nix|_> Cork: Thanks!
[04:26:50] <NoReGreT> formers: what is another way ?
[04:28:20] <formers> <a href="JavaScript:void(0);">asd</a>
[04:28:44] <jedimind> hey, quick question, i have a form submit inside jquery mobile im trying to hijack and prevent default action from happening
[04:29:00] <NoReGreT> formers: i remembered, it was preventDefault(), is it the same ?
[04:29:04] <jedimind> but preventDefault() does nto seem to be doing the trick, im guessing jquery mobile is still attempting to submit it
[04:29:52] <cachemoney> is there a way i can pass a callback to .append that's called when everything is appended and ready (causing some nasty race conditions since everything is async)
[04:30:34] <formers> NoReGreT: yeah you can use prevent default something like $("$
[04:31:24] <formers> NoReGreT: yeah you can use prevent default something like $("#myid").click(function(event){event.preventDefault(); ... other code... });
[04:31:44] <nachoelg> hello
[04:31:47] <cachemoney> or is there a way to make .append block?
[04:32:10] <Cork> block?
[04:32:29] <formers> nachoelg: hello
[04:32:37] <Cork> cachemoney: block what?
[04:32:38] <nachoelg> I have a question about dragging files and post them
[04:33:00] <nachoelg> Ihave been trying to do it
[04:33:09] <nachoelg> I could drag the files and read them
[04:33:14] <cachemoney> Cork: block anything else from happening until it finishes appending and everything is ready
[04:33:14] <nachoelg> but not post them
[04:33:31] <Cork> cachemoney: no not really
[04:33:40] <cachemoney> Cork: I have a nasty race condition and i wanna be able to know when .append is done
[04:33:53] <nachoelg> I was wondering if anyone could help me out
[04:34:07] <Cork> cachemoney: save a variable when you start and reset it when your done
[04:34:11] <formers> Cork : you can do it if a state is managed
[04:34:17] <Cork> cachemoney: append is syncron so it should work fine
[04:34:21] <cachemoney> Cork: how do i know it's "done"?
[04:34:58] <Cork> window.appinding_new_elements = true; $elm.append('text'); window.appinding_new_elements = false;
[04:35:26] <cachemoney> Cork: yeah, i tried that, and it seems append is behaving asynchronously
[04:35:28] <Cork> cachemoney: only situation when you can get race around append, is through ajax or timer events
[04:35:30] <nachoelg> maybe this is not the right room to ask this question
[04:35:38] <cachemoney> Cork: there's ajax
[04:35:38] <Cork> cachemoney: it doesn't
[04:36:06] <cachemoney> .append is being called inside a $.getJSON
[04:36:20] <cachemoney> dunno if that makes a difference
[04:36:28] <Cork> it doens't
[04:36:40] <Cork> append is basciallt a wrapper for appendNode
[04:36:47] <Cork> and thats a dom function
[04:36:53] <Cork> *basically
[04:37:17] <cachemoney> hmm ok
[04:37:18] <cachemoney> thanks
[04:37:22] <cachemoney> must be something else in my code
[04:37:51] <jedimind> anyone know why jquery mobile might potentially be preventing my e.preventDefault from not sumbitting a form ? (data-ajax="false" is already set)
[04:40:58] <NoReGreT> I got <div id='div'><div class='cl'></div> some text </div> how can i remove "some text" from there ?
[04:41:14] <michaelr525> hey people
[04:41:35] <michaelr525> anyone knows of a jquery autocomplete plugin that mimicks as much of google instant?
[04:41:51] <NoReGreT> or then again replace it with something else
[04:43:03] <formers> NoReGreT: wrap it in a span
[04:43:13] <formers> to get the direct access to that node
[04:43:21] <jomofcw> NoReGreT use getContents
[04:43:22] <blackspotwiggins> NoReGreT, you can select the textnode with pure dom
[04:43:22] <formers> or a iv
[04:43:32] <jomofcw> ? contents()
[04:43:33] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[04:45:09] <NoReGreT> blackspotwiggins: what do you mean
[04:45:31] <blackspotwiggins> $(".cl")[0].nextSibling iirc
[04:45:57] <NoReGreT> jomofcw: contents reads it, i want to set it (remove it)
[04:46:30] <stygyan> hello guys. anyone can recommend a simple dropdown plugin?
[04:46:39] <NoReGreT> or put something in its place
[04:47:03] <Cork> stygyan: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/selectmenu/index.html
[04:47:04] <formers> stygyan: drop down list ?
[04:47:05] <nachoelg> any one has use the drag and drop to send file to the server?
[04:47:12] <stygyan> thank you, Cork :)
[04:47:15] <stygyan> oh no
[04:47:17] <stygyan> dropdown menu
[04:47:57] <Cork> stygyan: you mean a menu bar or a context menu=
[04:47:59] <Cork> *?
[04:48:01] <stygyan> menu bar
[04:49:35] <Cork> stygyan: no experience there, but you could have a look at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/38666403/Menubar
[04:49:58] <Cork> (and there poc http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/menubar/default.html )
[04:53:06] <formers> stygyan: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu
[04:53:46] <stygyan> thank you, Cork  and former :D
[04:54:15] <hariom> I have a legacy application that has html pages written in tal. I am creating a new page that will have radio buttons to filter which page to load. How to load a page dynamically ?
[04:54:23] <formers> that's for the upcoming jquery ui menu but there are links of other plugins to check out if you cannot wait
[04:54:55] <Cork> ?.load @ hariom
[04:54:55] <bot-t> hariom, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[04:55:03] <Cork> bah
[04:55:22] <Cork> hariom: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[04:56:35] <stygyan> thanks for the help
[04:56:38] <stygyan> i'm going to have some lunch
[04:56:53] <NoReGreT> jomofcw: ?
[04:57:59] <jomofcw> NoReGreT you could iterate each element then, and use the core DOM JS thing to delete it
[04:58:45] <hariom> Cork: will that be able to parse tal expressions? It is like parsing a django template that is done at the server side.
[04:59:20] <jomofcw> NoReGreT http://api.jquery.com/contents
[04:59:37] <jomofcw> Just look at the first example
[05:00:11] <jomofcw> hariom dunno what are you talking about but just remeber taht doing template with JS is a bad idea.
[05:00:40] <Cork> hariom: no you will have to generate html that the browser can understand
[05:00:47] <jomofcw> worse idea ever imo ^^
[05:01:13] <Cork> hariom: alternativly you can use something like jquery template http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
[05:01:34] <hariom> jomofcw: I want to load an html page that has a template language something like Django's template page.
[05:02:14] <jomofcw> hariom you have to parse/process this template server side before
[05:02:40] <jomofcw> and then, as Cork said, you have to send to the the browser a real HTML thing.
[05:02:50] <hariom> Cork: http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/ this is not possible in my case. Is there any way to get it parsed and then load ? something like form action does
[05:02:54] <jomofcw> HTML, XHTML, XML or whatever you need
[05:03:09] <jomofcw> but not something that need to be full parse/processed by JS.
[05:03:31] <jomofcw> hariom that's a server side scruipt problem
[05:03:36] <jomofcw> not a jQuery thing
[05:03:37] <Cork> hariom: the template plugin is the only alternative i know of, beside plain html
[05:03:38] <casiodk> Hu guys... Im trying to submit a search form with an AJAX call in my Ruby on Rails app... Heres the jQuery code... http://pastie.org/2416077  - But i get this error and nothing is happening : [2011-08-23 12:16:06] ERROR bad URI `/[object%20Object]?_=1314094566413'.
[05:03:40] <jomofcw> imo
[05:03:42] <NoReGreT> jomofcw: you mean like $('.cl')[1] ? that returned undefined... not sure how to use the core DOM thing...
[05:03:49] <casiodk> Can anybody help please
[05:04:21] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, $(this.action) is prolly wrong
[05:04:48] <casiodk> ok, what should i do instead
[05:04:56] <casiodk> i thought it was the .serialize method
[05:05:00] <blackspotwiggins> not wrap it in $()
[05:05:28] <blackspotwiggins> why dont you use :remote => true in the form?
[05:05:42] <jomofcw> NoReGreT $("#mytarget").contents().filter(function(){ return this.nodeType != 1; }).remove();
[05:05:44] <casiodk> $.get($(this.action), this.serialize(), null, "script");
[05:05:47] <casiodk> like that?
[05:05:55] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, can you read?
[05:05:57] <blackspotwiggins> seriously?
[05:06:07] <casiodk> $.get(this.action, $(this).serialize(), null, "script");
[05:06:15] <casiodk> like that?
[05:06:47] <NoReGreT> jomofcw: if i want to use nodeType == 3, how can I print the matched text ?
[05:06:54] <casiodk> sorry, im a beginner, u may spell it out for me :)
[05:07:10] <formers> NoReGreT: why don
[05:07:21] <formers> t you wrap in span element ?
[05:07:39] <NoReGreT> formers: since im' not the one generating it
[05:07:56] <jomofcw> NoReGreT $("#mytarget").contents().filter(function(){ return this.nodeType == 3; }).text(); but not sure, try it.
[05:07:56] <casiodk> i followed a railscast tutorial, he didn´t use remote true
[05:07:57] <formers> fair enough
[05:08:34] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, to do what exactly?
[05:08:35] <NoReGreT> i'm not sure of the difference between find() and filter()
[05:09:15] <blackspotwiggins> NoReGreT, filter works on current set
[05:09:20] <blackspotwiggins> find searches down dom
[05:09:25] <casiodk> blackspotwiggins, i wanna send search params via an ajax call, an re render search partial
[05:09:35] <jomofcw> NoReGreT find will find something in the selected element (children etc.), filter will just iterate each element in the set and return only those that return true for the filter.
[05:09:36] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, so why are you using script type?
[05:09:50] <jomofcw> blackspotwiggins is right and clearer than me ^^
[05:09:59] <casiodk> blackspotwiggins, im really not sure
[05:10:00] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, just use :remote => true on the form and bind to "ajax:success" to render whatever you need
[05:10:07] <NoReGreT> :)
[05:10:28] <casiodk> blackspotwiggins, can you give me a pastie example
[05:10:45] <blackspotwiggins> not rly
[05:10:52] <casiodk> as i said, im a beginner...
[05:11:00] <blackspotwiggins> yeah i got that
[05:11:14] <blackspotwiggins> well, start by throwing current js out
[05:11:16] <NoReGreT> so i removed that text, i want to put it its place a textarea, append isn't quite useful since running the event several times will insert many textareas, while i want only one. how is it possible
[05:11:21] <blackspotwiggins> and trying the form with :remote => true
[05:11:29] <blackspotwiggins> you are using rails3 i assume?
[05:11:29] <casiodk> well bind to "ajax:success" doesnt mean anything to me
[05:11:33] <casiodk> yes
[05:11:37] <casiodk> 3.09
[05:11:46] <blackspotwiggins> ok, if/when the request works properly
[05:11:55] <jedimind> i have options i'm defining, and am using <input data-validation="{required: true}"> and attempting to $.expand the default options with data-validation set; but $.expand(options, $(this).attr('data-validation')) is not doing the trick, im guessing i have to do something to data-validation first ?
[05:11:56] <jomofcw> NoReGreT do you try to just wrap it in a textarea ?
[05:12:03] <NoReGreT> i'll try replaceAll
[05:12:11] <NoReGreT> jomofcw: no, i didn't try
[05:12:15] <casiodk> the search request is functioning without ajax
[05:12:17] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, first you need this
[05:12:19] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs
[05:12:33] <jomofcw> NoReGreT $("#mytarget").contents().filter(function(){ return this.nodeType == 3; }).wrap('<textarea>');
[05:12:46] <jomofcw> It will do the job only once
[05:13:07] <jomofcw> because next time you run it, the text node won't be a children of #myTarget anymore
[05:13:09] <casiodk> blackspotwiggins, yes ok
[05:13:31] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, when you include that script you can use rails helper methods for ajax
[05:13:37] <blackspotwiggins> like aforementioned :remote stuff
[05:13:49] <blackspotwiggins> and you can bind to event called "ajax:success"
[05:14:00] <blackspotwiggins> that triggers when the request was successful
[05:14:15] <blackspotwiggins> from there you can replace current html with that returned by partial
[05:14:21] <blackspotwiggins> makes sense?
[05:14:30] <casiodk> blackspotwiggins, ok, ill give it a try
[05:15:04] <casiodk> blackspotwiggins, yes sort of... Maybe ill come back with more Q´s :)
[05:15:05] <casiodk> blackspotwiggins, thx
[05:15:38] <NoReGreT> jomofcw: not sure why, but that wrapped the text and added another 3 textareas !
[05:15:50] <NoReGreT> so 4 textareas in total
[05:15:56] <oal> :visible returns no objects, but I know there are some visible. Why?
[05:16:39] <formers> does anyone know of a good spinbox (numeric or other values of a list)
[05:16:41] <formers> ?
[05:29:46] <NoReGreT> I want to insert a textarea, append isn't quite useful since running the event several times will insert many textareas, while i want only one. how is it possible
[05:31:08] <davegarath> Hi all, I have a little problem. I'm trying to exec a item.load of a table but the content don't change. I tried to exec a item.hide() and it works; I tried to get url manually and I cat get content. How can I investigate why my item.load doesn't work ?
[05:32:30] <fRAiLtY-> I have this script http://www.blackwellprint.co.uk/send/ which replaces the submit button with a loading gif when it's submitted, however I have validation on the fields so if they're blank it displays a warning. If a field is blank and someone clicks submit, the warning displays fine but then the submit button changes to the gif. Can I only make it change when all fields are full?
[05:32:45] <davegarath> I tried also to add function() { alter('test'); } to my .load but I don't see any alert  :(
[05:33:10] <davegarath> I don't understand where I'm wrong
[05:34:57] <yan__nick> hey guys, how can i fade out my div after 7 secs? http://jsfiddle.net/cqQJx/
[05:35:19] <yan__nick> it should being at the same time like my .animate()
[05:41:39] <mc_plectrum> my dom looses focus and i have to call an event twice, before it gets triggered
[05:42:22] <mc_plectrum> i tried $(document).focus(); but it does not help... what can i do to trigger the event directly at the first call?
[05:44:46] <yan__nick> Here you can see that http://jsfiddle.net/93mcy/
[05:46:56] <yan__nick> Sorry, this one http://jsfiddle.net/Ldaqc/ *
[05:52:05] <Getty> its unbelievable....
[05:52:17] <Getty> 867 people and dead....
[05:53:39] <jedimind> do you have a question ?
[05:54:25] <Getty> nah, not really, or if you ask, can you point me to a good overview of all the jquery-ui CSS classes?
[05:54:51] <Getty> i was just here when we had 50 people and we switched the culture, i dont like the new culture ;) so silent
[05:54:58] <yan__nick> Getty: :D
[05:55:26] <Getty> i mean CSS class => effect, or is the themeroller already "thats all we got"?
[05:55:35] <Getty> "effect" ;) style
[05:56:13] <Getty> I talk for example about this stuff like ui-state-error
[05:56:39] <Getty> i also would like to use the widget style just as plain element on the page, and i THINK the CSS of UI was prepared todo so, its just hard to find that documentation
[05:57:50] <jedimind> last i checked themeroller basically covered everything you may need, without disecting by hand
[05:58:59] <jedimind> sigh jquery mobile is giving me such a headache
[05:59:17] <jedimind> not really because of mobiel itself but because i'm trying to rush to get something done, and i dont know enough about jmobile to do it properly
[05:59:28] <NoReGreT> what nodeType points to a <div>? is there one that does?
[05:59:53] <jedimind> would anyone happen to know if there's a handler to trigger data-role="none" on a form (to avoid form input replication) on or off
[06:01:54] <melvinram> I'm trying to write an if statement that checks if any of the radio buttons for a set of radio buttons are selected. Is there a way to do this?
[06:02:46] <erichynds> $('input[name="foo"][checked]').length > 0
[06:03:36] <melvinram> erichynds: thanks, let me try
[06:04:49] <Nico___> does anyone has an idea what's wrong with this? The click is registered (showed an alert before) but the ajax doesn't get executed :(
[06:04:50] <Nico___> http://pastebin.com/SsZdEEYK
[06:06:01] <melvinram> erichynds: that didn't work.
[06:06:19] <melvinram> erichynds: I have: if ($('input[name="ncm[cost_center_type]"][checked]').length > 0) { ... }
[06:07:21] <erichynds> works for me http://jsfiddle.net/PLHRq/
[06:07:56] <casiodk> blackspotwiggins, http://pastie.org/2416660 ... can you tell me what im doing wrong please
[06:08:16] <erichynds> melvinram: you can also do $('input[name="foo"]').is(":checked")
[06:08:21] <NoReGreT> how can i find() everything *except* '#id' for example
[06:08:40] <melvinram> erichynds: ya got it working by doing if ( ! $('input[name="ncm[cost_center_type]"]').is(':checked') ) { ... }
[06:08:53] <melvinram> erichynds: I think I had the logic wrong in the last one
[06:08:58] <Aple> Anyone know of a plugin that just continually scrolls/loops? Kinda like a marquee tag or something?
[06:08:58] <erichynds> werd
[06:11:54] <Nico___> does anyone have an idea why this won't work : http://pastebin.com/SsZdEEYK , using ajax to POST an object... :(
[06:12:28] <Nico___> can't even get to my view (controller: AjaxController the action is of type jsonresult, named: AddDefaultValue
[06:13:00] <NoReGreT> how can i find() everything *except* '#id' for example
[06:14:08] <erichynds> NoReGreT: $("div:not(#id)") will give you all divs... you could use * for everything, but it's not recommended
[06:14:51] <casiodk> Im also having trouble with ajax and jquery...  http://pastie.org/2416660
[06:15:45] <Nico___> can ajax transfer values with an underscore in the name?
[06:15:53] <casiodk> Can anybody take a look and give me some pointers as to why this doesnt work
[06:16:27] <NoReGreT> erichynds: it's actually like so: <div id='div'><div class='adiv'></div>other stuff that should be removed</div> i wan to keep 'adiv' and remove everything else in 'div'
[06:16:38] <casiodk> Im gettin this strange error message [2011-08-23 14:49:29] ERROR bad URI `/[object%20Object]?_=1314103769375'.
[06:17:24] <erichynds> NoReGreT: $("#div").children(":not(.adiv)").remove()
[06:18:03] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, dude
[06:18:07] <blackspotwiggins> i told you to remove your old js
[06:18:23] <casiodk> Ive tried and tried, could not get it working
[06:18:41] <casiodk> ive installed jquery:ujs
[06:18:45] <casiodk> though
[06:19:09] <blackspotwiggins> well until you remove that bit, you'll get that same error
[06:19:44] <NoReGreT> erichynds: it's not running, nothing is happening
[06:20:14] <erichynds> console.log the selectors and make sure they're matching elems
[06:20:29] <casiodk> Hey :) i just removed the javascript completely, and now it works :)
[06:20:34] <casiodk> me happy, thanks
[06:21:53] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, you are still not doing it completely correctly tho
[06:22:07] <blackspotwiggins> instead of returning js you should return html
[06:22:17] <blackspotwiggins> and handle the replacement on the main script
[06:22:26] <casiodk> No... What do you mean?
[06:23:07] <casiodk> Ok? How to do that?
[06:23:40] <casiodk> I also got a problem with the hidden fields in the form not being passed along
[06:24:39] <blackspotwiggins> casiodk, well, using that ajax:success event i mentioned earlier
[06:25:05] <casiodk> ok, where do i put that, and how?
[06:25:41] <casiodk> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3501317/rails3-rails-js-and-jquery-catching-success-and-failure-of-ajax-requests
[06:25:52] <casiodk> Cant get this to work...
[06:26:15] <blackspotwiggins> ugh
[06:26:30] <blackspotwiggins> im not doing any more work for you, please try to learn something for yourself
[06:26:35] <blackspotwiggins> i've told you everything you need
[06:26:38] <blackspotwiggins> some things twice
[06:28:28] <NoReGreT> erichynds: what should i see in the console if the selectors match ?
[06:28:37] <erichynds> the DOM elements
[06:29:33] <casiodk> i appreciate, still i can not just guess the code, and the things ive tried so far didnt work with .bind method
[06:30:49] <anli_> I want to extrude, using the coordinate arrows, but they dissapear when I use E
[06:31:08] <NoReGreT> erichynds: does this look wrong, $('.goog-trans-section').children(":not(.goog-trans-control)").remove() since each selector used to match before, but not in this one...
[06:35:21] <rndstr> how do I get the datepicker instanceI attached to a certain element?
[06:36:58] <aaronmcadam> ?filter @NoReGreT
[06:36:58] <bot-t> NoReGreT, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[06:38:39] <NoReGreT> erichynds: i found the issue, it's that this will select elements but not text, why is that
[06:39:27] <aaronmcadam> that doesn't make sense
[06:40:30] <Aple> Anyone know of a plugin that autoscrolls images continuously?
[06:40:33] <Aple> Like.. loops them.
[06:40:34] <NoReGreT> aaronmcadam: what i wrote will match the ones other than the not() but not text... not sure if that's clear..
[06:40:35] <Aple> Without a pause.
[06:40:42] <groenroos> When a user clicks on a button, I add a css file to the DOM. Is there any way to pre-load the file without applying the CSS rules to the page?
[06:40:56] <erichynds> NoReGreT: deleting an element will delete the text inside it
[06:41:21] <aaronmcadam> uh..k
[06:42:00] <NoReGreT> erichynds: i know, but the text next to the element isn't matched
[06:42:36] <erichynds> ok, then use contents(), filter the text nodes, and remove them. or move the div outside its container, then delete the container
[06:57:33] <ratrace> Hi. using .fadeOut() on already hidden element (display:none) makes teh element become suddenly visible and then fades out. Is this a known bug? Couldn't find anything in teh tracker. jQuery 1.6.2
[07:02:03] <rahmen> Hi! I'm making a lot of jsonp-ajax calls and I'm looking for a way to implement a load indicator. Since the calls are async I can't find a good solution. Any ideas?
[07:02:29] <sadmicrowave> rahmen, do the calls have to be async?
[07:03:13] <rahmen> sadmicrowave: jsonp calls have to be yes - as I understand it. (since it's not a regular function call but rather a reference)
[07:03:40] <das3zehn> hi. I'm looking for a way to save the name of a checked checkbox on check in a cookie - but in a way that allows me to save multiple values in one cookie (cookie content should look like foo||bar||m00h) and if a checkbox is unchecked by the user delete the name of the checkbox from the cookie content: uncheck foo results in a cookie value of bar||m00h - any ideas?
[07:04:25] <ezflashback> i have a short question ... im working on http://shop.be-broke.de/ ... i would like to put the splatter image at position over the menu ... like here ... http://www.soundscan-mixshow.com/ ... something like a overlay ... do you know how to do it?
[07:04:58] <ajpiano> das3zehn $("input:checkbox:checked").map(function() {  return this.name }).get().join("||
[07:05:01] <sadmicrowave> rahmen, but the way I understand ajax is regardless of function call or reference call, async lets the javascript on client side continue while waiting for a response from ajax.  Async: false will disable that
[07:05:03] <ajpiano> das3zehn $("input:checkbox:checked").map(function() {  return this.name }).get().join("||") even
[07:05:22] <aaronmcadam> sexy
[07:05:23] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave: you can't put async false on a jsonp call
[07:05:24] <ajpiano> it's always gonna be synchronous
[07:05:27] <vladikoff> ezflashback, css
[07:05:32] <ajpiano> asynchronous*
[07:05:49] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: and you shouldn't do that anyway. synchronous calls are icky and bad UX
[07:06:08] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, yea I remember reading that
[07:06:16] <ezflashback> im working in the css ... asked elsewhere ... but nobody responded in the other channel
[07:06:37] <kborchers> nothing worse than the browser locking up ... people thinks its borked

[07:06:54] <das3zehn> ajpiano I'm no "pro" when it comes to jquery but as far as I read your code this just reads the status of the checkbox on page load - not on click, or do I have some brainbug?
[07:07:00] <hariom> how to make iframe automatically expand to content's width and height ?
[07:07:05] <ajpiano> das3zehn: brainbug
[07:07:11] <das3zehn> k - thx :)
[07:07:15] <ajpiano> you use that code inside of a checkbox change event
[07:07:18] <ajpiano> or when the form is submitted
[07:07:23] <ajpiano> or whenever you want to
[07:07:40] <das3zehn> aight - I'll try my best.... not the best day to code for me today
[07:07:40] <das3zehn> ...
[07:07:46] <rahmen> kborchers: you have any ideas how to implement a loader? I've got quite a few requests on one action. So I'd like to lock everything and display a loding symbol. But I don't know when the ajax calls are done.
[07:08:41] <kborchers> rahmen: hmmm, if you really want to "lock" everything, you could use a modal dialog that shows your info is loading and then remove it when done
[07:09:26] <ezflashback> i try it now ^^
[07:09:28] <boily> hello all!
[07:09:55] <rahmen> kborchers: But I can't just put "start dialog"-function before the calls and "end dialog"-function after. Since it will instantly end the dialog because of the async... How is this supposed to be implemented?
[07:10:24] <aaronmcadam> close the dialog from your callback
[07:10:34] <kborchers> rahmen: open dialog before and then close it in the final callback
[07:10:52] <ajpiano> rahmen: $.when( $.getJSON(), $.getJSON(), $.getJSON() ).then(fn)
[07:11:02] <aaronmcadam> hahah :D
[07:11:06] <ajpiano> rahmen: or $.when.apply(null, arrayOfAjaxCalls)
[07:11:06] <kborchers> ajpiano++
[07:11:08] <aaronmcadam> ?$.when
[07:11:09] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, jQuery.when() - Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[07:11:17] <aaronmcadam> nice
[07:12:43] <boily> I have a little question. On a page I'm working on, there is a button where I want some kind of highlight with extra information when I mouse over it. I'm trying to put a dialog around it. I managed to get the position right, but I'm having trouble with the z-index. What should be the right values to make the dialog appear under the button, but above the surrounding elements?
[07:13:03] <rahmen> ajpiano: will this work? $.when(my-function-that-does-all-the-ajax-stuff()).then(fn) ?
[07:13:54] <ajpiano> rahmen: if your function that does the ajax stuff's return value is an observable (a call to $.ajax or one of the helper methods or a Deferred.promise())
[07:14:50] <aaronmcadam> does that just publish a success event of sorts
[07:15:23] <ajpiano> something like that
[07:15:39] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:15:49] <rahmen> ajpiano: what if the function calls X number of ajax requests? Can I return them all in an array? :)
[07:16:14] <ajpiano> rahmen: yes, then you'd use that that $.when.apply(null, arrayofajaxcalls).then(fn) syntax
[07:16:25] <aaronmcadam> on the road to inception part deux there surely tho
[07:16:44] <ajpiano> nope
[07:16:53] <ajpiano> i use that pattern all the time, it's the bomb
[07:17:09] <aaronmcadam> sequential ajax calls that run in order really?
[07:17:20] <ajpiano> they don't run in order
[07:17:32] <ajpiano> the .then() just fires when they've *all* completed
[07:17:36] <aaronmcadam> right, but the then func waits for them to succeed?
[07:17:41] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:17:41] <ajpiano> yup
[07:18:08] <kborchers> ajpiano: does the then wait for success or just complete?
[07:18:33] <rahmen> ajpiano: and to return an ajax observable I return the ajax call like this? return $.ajax( url: ..., dataType: jsonp, success: ....);
[07:19:25] <ajpiano> .done == success, .fail == error, .then  == success, fail, .always == complete
[07:19:25] <shomon> hi, how do I test that $('#transf3').hide(); has been called?
[07:19:28] <ajpiano> rahmen: yup
[07:19:34] <hariom> how to make iframe automatically expand to content's width and height ? and what if iframe's content has ajax call that dynamically increases the content in the iframe ?
[07:19:38] <ajpiano> rahmen: this requries jquery 1.5+
[07:19:41] <ajpiano> fyi
[07:19:45] <kborchers> nice! yeah, i was just reading the docs.
[07:20:02] <christianredding> Could someone help me, I'm trying to change the dayNamesMin in date picker, but i keep getting thrown syntax errors, so i'm obviously not implementing it correctly. The code shown in http://pastebin.com/BhbHpMyf is what i'm using to pass the date clicked to some other code, i need the dayNamesMin to work with that..
[07:20:35] <ezflashback> <vladikoff> ... do you have a msn adress?
[07:20:36] <rahmen> ajpiano: ok, thanks alot! :) best help in #jquery I've seen so far :)
[07:21:06] <ajpiano> :)
[07:21:11] <aaronmcadam> nice
[07:21:12] <shomon> is it if(('transf3)'.css('display')!="none") to test if a "hide" has been called on a div?
[07:21:26] <tbranyen> awww, best help in #jquery :) +1 to ajpiano
[07:21:33] <ajpiano> rahmen: always much easier to help the helpable
[07:21:36] <aaronmcadam> first time I actually looked at the new ajax stuff
[07:21:51] <aaronmcadam> or more clearly, got it
[07:21:55] <aaronmcadam> hehe cheers adam :)
[07:22:14] <ajpiano> shomon: i'd use if ($("#foo").is(":hidden")) { }
[07:22:18] <aaronmcadam> I've not had any need for the deferred stuff yet tho
[07:22:35] <ajpiano> once you know how it works, it's a lot easier to identify use cases for it
[07:22:50] <shomon> aaah thanks very much ajpiano !
[07:22:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:25:31] <rahmen> ajpiano: Can you clearify when "then" is called? when success is called or when success is done?
[07:25:40] <nvictor> hola
[07:25:46] <ajpiano> i believe it's called when all locally defined option callbacks are done
[07:25:48] <nvictor> is there a way to prevent a plugin from executing?
[07:26:53] <aaronmcadam> how do u mean nvictor
[07:27:04] <aaronmcadam> on the non existence of some element maybe?
[07:27:07] <rahmen> ajpiano: hmm.. it seems to be called before success is done... I'll look closer into it
[07:29:14] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: here's the thing
[07:29:44] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: most plugin just attach themselves to elements (in my case fancybox would attach itself to my anchor)
[07:30:16] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: now i don't want the anchor default behaviour (opening an iframe) to work at all if there are errors on the page
[07:30:22] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: doesn't work :(
[07:30:42] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: i need a way to prevent fancybox from doing anything, but the API is not helping
[07:30:52] <aaronmcadam> if there are errors??
[07:31:12] <aaronmcadam> there's a beforeShow method
[07:31:21] <nvictor> for real?
[07:31:22] <aaronmcadam> why don't you do if ( test ) { return; }
[07:31:25] <aaronmcadam> yep
[07:31:30] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: awesahm!
[07:31:37] <nvictor> where is the doc?
[07:31:38] <aaronmcadam> haven't u read the api?
[07:31:50] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: :lol: i have it opened here
[07:31:54] <rahmen> ajpiano: This is what I do: http://pastebin.com/N54ppYaL It looks fine right?
[07:32:04] <aaronmcadam> ha you just said it wasn't helping
[07:32:05] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: http://fancybox.net/api
[07:32:12] <ajpiano> seems reasonable
[07:32:24] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: maybe we are not talking about the same api?
[07:32:32] <aaronmcadam> i'm talkin bout fancybox ye
[07:33:02] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: where do you find beforeshow? :lol:
[07:33:51] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: nvm there is a onStart
[07:33:54] <aaronmcadam> k
[07:35:00] <rahmen> ajpiano: but I put an alert in the then-function and an alert in the end of an ajax call. And the then-alert appears before the ajax call's alert.. I'm not sure I've misunderstood you or not.
[07:35:15] <ajpiano> i might just be wrong about the timing there
[07:35:32] <Aple> I have a question. I've defined a var in my jQuery wrapper in my <head>. Then I go to document.write it in my <body> and it doesn't show. Any ideas?
[07:36:21] * aaronmcadam remove the write method from Aple's brain
[07:36:31] <Aple> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/463044/
[07:36:46] <Aple> I mean, shouldn't that work though?
[07:36:52] <kborchers> Aple: no
[07:36:58] <aaronmcadam> don't do it that way
[07:37:04] <Aple> kborchers: Why not?
[07:37:10] <Aple> Isn't that what document.write does?
[07:37:14] <kborchers> your document.write will run before document.ready
[07:37:15] <Aple> Or is the var getting trapped in jQuery?
[07:37:20] <Aple> Ah.
[07:37:43] <aaronmcadam> try not to use doc.write anyway dude
[07:37:48] <kborchers> plus, why are you document.writing
[07:37:51] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: where did you find the beforeShow method?
[07:38:03] <aaronmcadam> I can't remember dude
[07:38:11] <nvictor> duuuude :)
[07:38:19] <nvictor> there is no beforeShow method :lol:
[07:38:33] <aaronmcadam> there's something similar
[07:38:36] <Aple> I was just trying to learn some JS :)
[07:38:48] <Aple> Trying to write an autoscrolling/looping carousel for images
[07:38:53] <Aple> So they seamlessly marquee
[07:38:56] <aaronmcadam> well learn it the right way
[07:39:06] <kborchers> Aple: if you have to dynamically add text to that h1, give it an id, then instead of setting a var just do $("#hiID").text("your new text");
[07:39:06] <Aple> Well, crap, tell me how
[07:39:35] <Aple> Thanks
[07:39:38] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with onStart nvictor
[07:39:51] <Aple> Works
[07:39:53] <aaronmcadam> onStart 	null 	Will be called right before attempting to load the content
[07:41:22] <kborchers> ?g Eloquent JavaScript @ Aple
[07:41:23] <bot-t> Aple, Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming - http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[07:42:06] <zoned> bot-t, is that for plain JS, or some jquery as well?
[07:42:07] <bot-t> zoned, Outlook good.
[07:42:12] <zoned> hahaha
[07:42:19] <zoned> kborchers^
[07:43:30] <kborchers> zoned: well, since jQuery is JavaScript ...
[07:43:34] <panchot> If you want to learn jquery, first learn plain js
[07:44:38] <panchot> "Javascript: The good parts" is pretty good
[07:44:39] <panchot> http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748
[07:44:59] <kborchers> This is another good one http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/
[07:45:46] <kborchers> and then for jQuery http://jqueryenlightenment.com/
[07:46:09] <zoned> i don't need to learn javascript. but i am new to jquery. i've written some stuff in jquery, but none of it is very elegant because i don't really know all of the powerful functions. i basically just use it for selectors and triggering events. that's why i hang out here :P
[07:46:32] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:46:39] <ajpiano> if you don't understand language concepts you're not going to ever "know all the powerful functions"
[07:46:43] <aaronmcadam> just playin with the new http://yuilibrary.com/ site
[07:46:46] <ajpiano> jquery isn't a spellbook that you use to cast magic on the DOM
[07:46:47] <aaronmcadam> cool stack it's built on
[07:46:57] <aaronmcadam> http://yuilibrary.com/about/
[07:47:26] <panchot> you can maybe read nice plugins code
[07:47:27] <panchot> like
[07:47:42] <panchot> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[07:48:03] <panchot> http://devthought.com/projects/jquery/textboxlist/
[07:48:11] <panchot> to see how to write elegant code
[07:48:14] <panchot> in jquery
[07:48:15] <aaronmcadam> jquery plugin boilerplate
[07:48:48] <Woet> is it possible to get the computed html from jquery?
[07:49:05] <Woet> e.g. <div id="html"><span id="hi"></span></div> and then $("#hi").text('hello');
[07:49:07] <aaronmcadam> do u meant mutated html?
[07:49:14] <Woet> i then want to get <div id="html"><span id="hi">hello</span></div>
[07:49:46] <aaronmcadam> if you did $("#hi").text('hello');
[07:50:06] <aaronmcadam> then $('#html').html() would return that line yea
[07:50:44] <zoned> ajpiano, why are you acting like someone who's an expert at JS is all of a sudden an expert at jquery?
[07:50:59] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[07:51:00] <ajpiano> lol, great way to phrase that
[07:51:05] <aaronmcadam> too right
[07:51:26] <aaronmcadam> because JavaScript is the best jQuery plugin don't you know that zoned
[07:51:35] <ajpiano> zoned:  because understanding the language concepts in javascript as they are applied in jQuery will greatly facilitate one's ability to efficiently and effectively use jQuery
[07:52:00] <aaronmcadam> and you then begin to undestand jQuery's real usefulness too
[07:52:11] <dr0id> jquery is useful ?
[07:52:14] <kborchers> ajpiano: or you could just use $.unicorn for everything ... yes, i brought it out again ;)
[07:52:15] <aaronmcadam> once you look at how to do DOM stuff with vanilla code
[07:52:22] <zoned> i understood jquery's usefulness the first time i used a selector and .each
[07:52:54] <aaronmcadam> what other languages do you use?
[07:53:03] <aaronmcadam> do you use rails without knowing ruby?
[07:53:59] <zoned> i've used c++ without knowing c :)
[07:54:14] <ajpiano> c++ is a different language than c, it's not a library on top of C
[07:54:16] <panchot> not the same
[07:54:21] <dr0id> many people learn rails without learning ruby
[07:54:24] <AdamCarter> Hi! I'm having an issue while doing an AJAX Jsonp cross domain request in opera... It works for every other browser, but in opera the callback is never called, nor the "error callback"... Any idea what this might be? or how to debug this to see what is happening? Opera 11.50 JQuery 1.6.1.
[07:54:27] <panchot> c is a subset of c++
[07:54:37] <panchot> jquery is a javascript framework
[07:54:51] <aaronmcadam> library i'd say but I digress
[07:54:51] <ajpiano> dr0id: they don't, in turn advocate, that it would be a bad thing for them to gradually learn more ruby and understand how that can help them write better rails apps
[07:55:10] <panchot> trueless
[07:55:13] <panchot> library
[07:56:39] <aaronmcadam> i'd love to have a team member turn round with that attitude though
[07:57:11] * ajpiano turns round with that attitude
[07:57:15] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:57:23] <aaronmcadam> it's ok if it's you dude :P
[07:58:18] <aaronmcadam> willingness to learn is the best thing about people in here though
[07:58:39] <aaronmcadam> just a shame some choose to ignore our advice sometimes
[08:00:11] <melvinram> I'm trying to do $(".ncm_form input[@name='ncm[cost_center_type]']").change( function() { ... } but it's giving this error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [@name='ncm[cost_center_type]']
[08:00:23] <ajpiano> melvinram: get rid of the @ in your attribute selectors
[08:00:30] <aaronmcadam> melvinram: that's xpath
[08:00:45] <aaronmcadam> deprecated since 1.4 or so?
[08:00:53] <aaronmcadam> maybe 1.3.2?
[08:00:57] <aaronmcadam> can't remember
[08:01:26] <zoned> i have a .change() function on 10 text boxes which calls some ajax that calls a php function. i trigger these .change()s in a loop, but it seems as if there's some race conditions, because the code doesn't work properly. if i debug it, and step through each .change slowly (or put in some alerts, or something), everything works perfectly. i've tried settings async=false, it is noticably slower/works better, but still isn't rig
[08:01:27] <zoned> ht.
[08:01:36] <Travis-42> I want to run a function when all links with ".requires-auth" are clicked that checks if the user is authenticated and if not, cancels any other events on the link and performs an action. I'm a little confused how to cancel click events on specific links when this happens (stopPropagation and preventDefault wouldnt work here)
[08:01:54] <melvinram> ajpiano: thanks... that got rid of the rror
[08:02:39] <nvictor> guys
[08:02:42] <nvictor> i'm trying this $('</a>', {'class':'iframe', 'href':'/cart/addressreview/'}) .fancybox().click();
[08:02:46] <aaronmcadam> yeah Travis-42 similar problem came up here last week
[08:02:59] <nvictor> but jquery is complaining, what's wrong with it?
[08:03:06] <melvinram> ajpiano: but that doesn't trigger the event on change for some reason
[08:03:09] <Travis-42> aaronmcadam, heh, so what was the solution? :-)
[08:03:10] <panchot> travis: use return false;
[08:03:17] <aaronmcadam> don't u mean <a/>
[08:03:27] <ajpiano> melvinram: maybe the selector is not selecting any elements
[08:04:09] <Travis-42> panchot, that doesn't solve the problem
[08:04:31] <balgarath> anyone know if I can make jquery-ui .autocomplete limit itself to the current word? I'm wanting to autocomplete on # or @ keypress for individual words
[08:04:33] <kborchers> ?stopImmediatePropagation @ Travis-42
[08:04:33] <bot-t> Travis-42, event.stopImmediatePropagation(): Keeps the rest of the handlers from being executed. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[08:04:38] <jeffsmykil> Im dealing with an ASP service that is expecting List<int>, anyone know anything about that with json?
[08:04:39] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: ok thanks :)
[08:05:17] <Travis-42> kborchers, that might work, if I could guarantee that my .requires-auth click handler would fire first. Do you know how to do this?
[08:05:19] <zoned> jeffsmykill, json is really more of a map than a list. use a different data structure
[08:05:41] <jeffsmykil> zoned: like soap?
[08:05:48] <aaronmcadam> xml?
[08:06:24] <kaputtmacher> hi there
[08:06:32] <jeffsmykil> zoned: so it's impossible?
[08:06:35] <aaronmcadam> you can pass lists in json anyway
[08:06:43] <kaputtmacher> can someone help me with a callback problem on infinitescroll ?
[08:06:57] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam: you can or, cannot?
[08:06:58] <zoned> ^ but if you're just passing a list back and forth, couldn't you juse use a regular array?
[08:07:01] <cohitre> ? ask @ kaputtmacher
[08:07:01] <bot-t> kaputtmacher, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:07:31] <jeffsmykil> zoned: I haven't tried sending a normal array yet
[08:07:31] <aaronmcadam> you need to serialize it though
[08:07:46] <aaronmcadam> nothing wrong with using json there i don't thikn
[08:07:48] <aaronmcadam> think*
[08:07:54] <jeffsmykil> aaronmcadam, serialize the array?
[08:08:01] <melvinram> ajpiano: nvm, turns out the event was getting triggered but I was handling it with a buggy function
[08:08:06] <kaputtmacher> i use infinite scroll for loading images on my wordpress portfolio website. the images are modified on wi ndowload via jquery. some grayscale clone of the images is created
[08:08:19] <aaronmcadam> or maybe send it as a string
[08:08:19] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: ok the other issue
[08:08:32] <jeffsmykil> yeah string doesnt work
[08:08:35] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: how do i turn a dynamically created element into a jquery object?
[08:08:35] <kaputtmacher> these clones are missing when content is loaded via ajax
[08:08:40] <jeffsmykil> especially since it wants an int
[08:08:47] <nvictor> jeffsmykil: strings forever \o/
[08:08:57] <Travis-42> basically I need a way to figure out how to guarantee that one event handler (".requires-auth").bind would trigger before ("#specific-link").bind so that I can cancel others. anyone know if this is possible?
[08:09:08] <kaputtmacher> because the grayscaleclone method is not executed on these loaded images
[08:09:14] <jeffsmykil> nvictor: I'm just interacting with someone elses webservice
[08:09:29] <kborchers> Travis-42: hmmm, i think it's possible but not exactly sure how. i think they fire in the order they are bound so if you can bind in the order you want, that may do it. ajpiano?
[08:09:32] <aaronmcadam> you need to send a string anyway as the data
[08:09:45] <kaputtmacher> infinitescroll gives me the option to use a function on callback, but i don't know how to adjust my code for thiks callback
[08:09:56] <danzik17> Travis-42:  Yes (kind of) but I don't know if the method I'm using is kosher.  I'm messing with the event order using stuff that jQuery doesn't explicitly expose
[08:10:01] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: $($('<div/>')) <---- does not work
[08:10:06] <kaputtmacher> if i just paste this snippet, nothing happens: http://pastebin.com/paMJxuVA
[08:10:08] <aaronmcadam> nvictor: if u need to use jq's methods, wrap what u want in a $()
[08:10:08] <danzik17> The alternative is to bind that event before the one you want to prevent
[08:10:09] <Travis-42> kborchers, that could work, but I don't know that I want to rely on always adding events in the correct order -- that seems like something that will fail eventually
[08:10:13] <zoned> jeffsmykill, just make your ajax call and see what your data object is when it returns, then figure out how to work with it.
[08:10:18] <ajpiano> that and a little bit of event.stopImmediatePropagation()
[08:10:19] <aaronmcadam> wtf
[08:10:19] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: well i did :lol:
[08:10:28] <aaronmcadam> you're already creating a jq object doing that
[08:10:35] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: for real?
[08:10:35] <jeffsmykil> zoned: getting a 500
[08:10:37] <aaronmcadam> ...
[08:10:39] <jeffsmykil> thats the issue
[08:10:43] <jeffsmykil> about serialization
[08:10:44] <aaronmcadam> $ === jQuery ?
[08:10:54] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: why doesn't fancy get work on it then?
[08:10:54] <kborchers> ajpiano: yeah, he wants to make sure nothing fires before the one that stops immediate though
[08:10:56] <AdamCarter> I've a webserver which answers some jsonp content with a 200 OK. If I only change the response to 201 Created the web page stops working in opera (It's a cross domain ajax jsonp request with opera 11.50 and jquery 1.6.1). It stills works in every other browser... Any idea why the 201 response "breaks" Opera? Or is this behavior correct/intended?
[08:11:07] <ajpiano> kborchers: yeah he'll have to rely on binding order :/
[08:11:25] <kborchers> that's what i thought Travis-42 ^^
[08:11:30] <aaronmcadam> different solution needed then
[08:11:42] <danzik17> Travis-42:  I doubt this is sanctioned by the team, but after you add your event, you can do element.data('events').click.shift( element.data('events').click.pop())
[08:11:50] <Travis-42> ajpiano, kborchers.. alright, thank you
[08:11:52] <danzik17> It works for me, but don't expect that to be supported
[08:11:53] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: $('<a/>').fancybox() <--- fails
[08:12:02] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: undefined method
[08:12:09] <Travis-42> danzik17, yea... that has it's own issues, but maybe I can consider that too
[08:12:18] <aaronmcadam> cuz u don't call it like that i don't think
[08:12:19] <nvictor> i have the impression that a jquery object is not returned
[08:12:27] <aaronmcadam> i thought it was $.fancybox, not $.fn.fancybox
[08:12:33] <kborchers> danzik17: yeah that sounds like it would work but a little scarier than relying on binding order
[08:12:44] <aaronmcadam> otherwise you're not loading fbox properly
[08:12:56] <SirCmpwn> donburks: poke
[08:13:03] <danzik17> kborchers:  It does work (I use it), but I have no illusions about support for it being maintained through versions, so care is definitely needed
[08:13:32] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: scratch what i previously said, a jquery object is returned
[08:13:36] <kborchers> yeah ... either way has it's pitfalls :/
[08:13:45] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: only without the plugins bindings... weird
[08:14:06] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: it is $.fancybox
[08:14:11] <nvictor> what's the difference?
[08:14:17] <ajpiano> danzik17: i appreciate both your craftiness and your understanding of the realities of using undocumented APIs :D
[08:14:18] <aaronmcadam> on how you call it
[08:14:26] <nvictor> ohh i see
[08:14:37] <nvictor> so how do i call it?
[08:14:42] <aaronmcadam> like the data method, right
[08:14:48] <aaronmcadam> there's $.data( ... )
[08:14:56] <aaronmcadam> and $( elem ).data()
[08:15:00] <ezflashback> hi @all
[08:15:12] <aaronmcadam> that's the diff between $.data and $.fn.data
[08:15:17] <aaronmcadam> follow nvictor
[08:15:23] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: you lost me :)
[08:15:26] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[08:15:34] <aaronmcadam> can u not see the different
[08:15:39] <aaronmcadam> difference*
[08:15:44] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: i was doing $('<a/>').fancybox()
[08:15:53] <aaronmcadam> so then you can't call it like that
[08:15:54] <ezflashback> i want to delete the lines in the table displayed at position user6 ... http://shop.be-broke.de/
[08:16:04] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: so i have to do $.fancybox($('<a/>')) ?
[08:16:13] <aaronmcadam> probably not exactly like that
[08:16:17] <aaronmcadam> but yea u got the idea
[08:16:24] <nvictor> aaronmcadam: k, thanks
[08:16:31] <aaronmcadam> np
[08:16:40] <pangel> upgrading from 1.5.2 to 1.6.2, a call .attr('class') now returns undefined instead of "". .prop('class') returns "", but I thought no change was needed for this upgrade.
[08:16:56] <aaronmcadam> nvictor: you know u can pass a url to fancybox
[08:17:18] <ezflashback> how do i do it?
[08:17:46] <aaronmcadam> so you could call fb with url : $( link )[0].href or somethin
[08:18:15] <aaronmcadam> pangel why don't u use [0].className?
[08:18:44] <pangel> aaronmcadam: I could, but the point is that I'm surprised that I have to change code when upgrading jQuery.
[08:19:00] <aaronmcadam> yea I kno
[08:19:02] <pangel> plus I don't understand the exact reason for this behavioral change
[08:19:15] <aaronmcadam> separation of interpreted dom props
[08:19:22] <aaronmcadam> and actual html i think
[08:19:59] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, how to discover if an element has just an event attached?
[08:20:01] <aaronmcadam> somebody correct me if need be
[08:20:28] <hariom> How to get the height of the iframe window?
[08:21:06] <balgarath> anyone know if I can make jquery-ui .autocomplete limit itself to the current word? I'm wanting to autocomplete on # or @ keypress for individual words
[08:21:17] <mbutubuntu> hariom, from the iframe? or from the parent?
[08:21:22] <hariom> I have a page that has iframe and embedding another page. I want my parent page & embedded page to dynamically increase height as the content in the embedded page increases or reduces
[08:22:03] <mbutubuntu> hariom, you could get height so: $('yourFrameId').height()... I think it could work...
[08:22:29] <gnarf> aaronmcadam: Yer right - pangel: .prop("className") should work too
[08:22:35] <hariom> mbutubuntu: trying it out.
[08:22:51] <aaronmcadam> cheers for clarifying gnarf
[08:22:53] <gnarf> but [0].className is gonna be quicker
[08:22:59] <pangel> gnarf: yes, I stated this in my original message
[08:23:02] <aaronmcadam> yeh i use that all the time
[08:23:44] <gnarf> pangel: you can always attrHook / propHook a replacement if you need to - we attrHooked most of the BC sticky points
[08:23:58] <gnarf> .attr("class") isn't that often used
[08:24:05] <pangel> gnarf: BC?
[08:24:13] <gnarf> backwards compat
[08:24:29] <pangel> gnarf: thanks for the advice about attrHook
[08:24:44] <pangel> gnarf: what other issue did you run into?
[08:24:48] <gnarf> pangel: I'd suggest updating your code tho
[08:25:01] <gnarf> .attr("checked") etc
[08:25:15] <pangel> gnarf: ok
[08:25:19] <gnarf> most uses of .attr() should probably be .prop() in 1.6
[08:25:34] <aaronmcadam> i tend to use is(':checked') for that
[08:25:53] <gnarf> [0].checked is still fastest :)
[08:26:57] <pangel> gnarf: except when I can measure a performance issue, I tend to favor readability and to stay at one API level.
[08:27:17] <pangel> gnarf: but that's pretty subjective :)
[08:28:03] <aaronmcadam> ah cool I'll start using that gnarf :)
[08:28:42] <aaronmcadam> returning a property rather than calling a method is always for the best obviously
[08:29:11] <zoned> i have 10 text inputs, each box depends on the preceeding (sometimes more than just one) boxe's value. each box has a .change associated with it which performs an ajax call. i'm trying to programmatically insert text into these boxes, so i select them, and add text to each one, then call it's .change function. setting ajax's async=false does not fix it, however stepping through the code manually/slowly makes everytihng work p
[08:29:11] <zoned> erfect. any ideas?
[08:30:04] <gnarf> ?p @zoned
[08:30:04] <bot-t> zoned, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:30:10] <mbutubuntu> hariom, did it work?
[08:30:59] <hariom> mbutubuntu: that doesn't work. It doesn't change the height as the content in embedded window increases. Embedded window show a scrollbar. What I need is to change the height of embedded window (iframe) if the content in the embedded grows.
[08:31:04] <loris> Ajax calls : any idea why jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders() would not return any custom headers ?
[08:31:32] <mbutubuntu> hariom, ok... but did that query gets the iframe height?
[08:31:48] <hariom> obviously it will .height() provides that
[08:32:39] <hariom> mbutubuntu: any solution on increasing the height as the content grows?
[08:34:55] <hariom> How to get the embedded window's height ? Embedded window is an iframe that has an ajax query and keep on increasing the content. How to increase the height of the iframe and its parent window so that there is no need for scrollbar
[08:35:43] <JKarsrud> check for the contents() height?
[08:36:18] <jmar777> hariom: is the iframe in the same domain?
[08:36:20] <JKarsrud> I suppose you can be able to bubble events out of the iframe to hook onto or something, not sure tho :)
[08:36:43] <hariom> jmar777: yes
[08:37:08] <mbutubuntu> hariom, you could try .parent() but I don't remember if it works... has your frame a jquery instance?
[08:37:54] <hariom> I can only put jquery in my parent window but not in embedded window (i.e. in iframe src page)
[08:38:20] <JKarsrud> hariom: then what is that iframe using to ajax its content?
[08:38:44] <jmar777> hariom: in the parent window, you should be able to do something like: window.updateChildIFrameHeight = function(height) { /* do stuff */ };
[08:39:23] <jmar777> hariom: and then in the iframe, whenever the height has been adjusted, do something like: window.top.updateChildIFrameHeight($(window).height())
[08:39:59] <hariom> JKarsrud: iframe src is a page that I can't change. It has ajax that pull some content and keep on increasing (or may be decreasing). I only have control over parent page
[08:40:02] <mbutubuntu> hariom, var obj = window.parent.frames[0]; is the obj if the parent page has only 1 frame...
[08:40:08] <mbutubuntu> than you can use obj as you want...
[08:40:15] <JKarsrud> hariom: aha, like that
[08:40:17] <pangel> gnarf: I don't understand something: is it possible for an attribute to be not set while the corresponding property is set?
[08:41:07] <gnarf> pangel: yes, properties change
[08:41:22] <gnarf> attrs generally don't
[08:43:02] <JKarsrud> hariom: since you don't have control over that page, I guess it would be hard to publish an event to hook onto to update your content... Does the page load the content by click, or by som auto stuff?
[08:43:21] <pangel> gnarf: does this mean that we cannot just upgrade the code to use prop() instead of attr(), but that we also have to check for undefined everywhere (instead of being able to assume a non-existent value would give us an empty string) ?
[08:43:55] <gnarf> pangel: it really depends on which prop/attr you are looking for
[08:43:58] <gnarf> not everything is a prop
[08:43:58] <JKarsrud> if it's by click/whatever, you could listen to that event by going $('#iframeId').contents().find('whatever').click(handlerThatUpdatesHeight)
[08:45:03] <JKarsrud> but everything is an attr, gnarf?
[08:45:40] <pangel> gnarf: ah... I will use attrHook and propHook to always return empty strings when the value is undefined. I don't see any downside
[08:46:07] <gnarf> pangel: the downside is changing the behavior expected by other peoples plugins
[08:46:20] <gnarf> what prop/attr in particular are you concerned about here?
[08:47:47] <pangel> none in particular, but there is a significant code base. I can read up on the topic, then look at all the places where we call attr() and decide if we should use prop() instead, then explain to everyone what to do next time they write js code.
[08:48:08] <pangel> or I can keep the old behaviour. Plugins are a problem, though.
[08:49:15] <hariom> JKarsrud, Jmar777, mbutubuntu: I got this link from google. http://jbscdev.blogspot.com/2007/08/automatic-iframe-height-sizing-using.html but it doesn't seem to work
[08:49:37] <mbutubuntu> hariom, :-(
[08:56:21] <mbutubuntu> hariom, I've found a goo solution for you
[08:56:26] <Elephant> woot
[08:56:55] <hariom> mbutubuntu: what is that?
[08:57:08] <mbutubuntu> hariom, you should give an ID to the iframe... from the iframe you can get this var obj = window.parent.document.getElementById('iframeId');
[08:57:31] <mbutubuntu> it will work... having the element you can set up the height whenever you want
[08:58:30] <mbutubuntu> hariom, tested on chrome... maybe it will work also on Gecko... you should test it on IE
[08:58:55] <AdAlpha> Hi guys, needed a bit of help. Can't figure out how I could scroll the page auto once I've slideDown a div.
[08:58:58] <AdAlpha> http://jsfiddle.net/RhMEW/
[08:59:17] <mbutubuntu> hariom, if tou have jquery in the iframe you should set up the height so: $('iframeId').css('height', 'HEIGHT');
[08:59:40] <AdAlpha> it's a bit a la "Tumbl'r " to give an idea.
[09:00:32] <mbutubuntu> hariom, I'm going away... I hope my help was useful
[09:00:34] <mbutubuntu> hello folks
[09:01:14] <mbtez> can someone help me debug my fancybox?
[09:01:52] <hariom> mbutubuntu: thanks. Trying it out
[09:02:15] <mbtez> http://decoratordetectives.heroku.com/favorite_rooms/ <-- doesn't work, i have NO idea why
[09:02:29] <mbtez> i followed the fancybox instructions to the letter
[09:02:46] <mbtez> you click on the images and it just opens them in another window
[09:03:06] <mbtez> in another tab instance, or w/e you call it
[09:05:23] <_ramo> hi
[09:06:19] <tub_> hey ho
[09:07:15] <SirCmpwn> so imagine an online shopping medium, where after a search, all results are shown in a grid with small amounts of content per cell
[09:07:25] <tub_> i'm tryint to load a json file with $.getJSON but always get an error. i'm doing something like this: http://privatepaste.com/646ef8e910/asfdasdf  but always get an alert with "error"
[09:07:30] <SirCmpwn> on the left is a visualization of your shopping cart
[09:07:39] <SirCmpwn> and users can drag items from the grid into the cart
[09:07:42] <tub_> the file on the same place where the script relies
[09:07:46] <SirCmpwn> any ideas on how this would best be implemented?
[09:07:52] <tub_> does anybody has an idea what's going wrong here?
[09:07:57] <SirCmpwn> tub_: I'll look
[09:08:17] <nvictor> i'm not sure about it
[09:08:30] <enjoycrf> whats goin on
[09:08:33] <nvictor> but it seems like return; isn't working in anonymous functions
[09:08:47] <AdAlpha> d/c, sorry I repost. need help on a sliding div implemented into a footer http://jsfiddle.net/RhMEW/
[09:09:18] <AdAlpha> if someone can take a look at it, that would be great!
[09:09:18] <mbtez> if there's a conflict with "$"
[09:09:20] <SirCmpwn> is key.json valid JSON?
[09:09:21] <mbtez> how do i figure out what it is?
[09:09:39] <tub_> SirCmpwn: i don't know, i have to check it, just a second
[09:09:48] <enjoycrf> sorry can not help noobs
[09:09:53] <SirCmpwn> that would be the first thing to look into

[09:10:12] <AdAlpha> this part's working
[09:10:27] <djQuery> whatsw the prob?
[09:10:30] <AdAlpha> yea, I've post above how you guys think I could autoscroll
[09:10:38] <AdAlpha> on the content in the hidden div
[09:10:52] <AdAlpha> so that user's don't missed that
[09:11:10] <tub_> SirCmpwn: do you know a json checker?

[09:11:52] <tub_> hehe
[09:11:53] <SirCmpwn> jeffisabelle: you have to code your server in brainfuck

[09:46:21] <Gho5t> use .eq
[09:47:51] <Gho5t> Is there a way to make jqGrid load data without using ajax
[09:48:35] <Foxandxss> You can also load local data
[09:49:12] <Gho5t> yeah i see that option
[09:49:15] <Gho5t> but i'm not sure how that works
[09:50:15] <Gho5t> but to give the backstory, i have 3 grids on a page and all of them use the same grid data except it's filtered differently. i don't want to have to make a separate call for each grid
[09:54:52] <djQuery> Gho5t: thought there was an additional plugin to get it to work agains tables that allready had data
[09:55:01] <Gho5t> oh yeah?
[09:55:06] <Gho5t> that'd be sweet
[09:55:06] <enjoycrf> is there a way to sort array or object
[09:55:10] <enjoycrf> whatever is easier

[09:58:53] <Foxandxss> Gho5t, sorry, was AFK. you can load the data once and use local data on the 3 grids
[09:59:08] <Gho5t> how exactly?
[09:59:11] <Gho5t> np
[09:59:48] <perturbedpanda> kind of an odd request - I'm trying to find good resources/books so my staff can learn jquery and css. Anyone have any recommendations?

[10:04:37] <Godfather_> i trien to select an option from a select when its ready, i tried this: http://pastebin.com/mM5fh57T  but it doesnt work ?
[10:05:15] <FelicianoX> Godfather_, give the options an id
[10:05:18] <Gho5t> plus loadonce disables the pager
[10:05:34] <Godfather_> FelicianoX, and then?
[10:05:39] <Segaja> Godfather_: select the id
[10:05:39] <kborchers> bgy: you would serialize the form and send that as the data in post see ?post

[10:05:48] <FelicianoX> oh yeah soz
[10:05:49] <FelicianoX> lol
[10:05:51] <jeffsmykil> why cant i just do this?
[10:05:52] <jeffsmykil> var serialized = finalElementID.serializeArray();
[10:06:00] <dutton> hi all just a quick question.. how do I show a hyperlink inside a var array?
[10:06:22] <fris> anyone know of a plugin like datepicker, but for addresses like google map?
[10:06:27] <Godfather_> Segaja, the select has an id
[10:06:39] <Godfather_>         $("#alojamiento").val("Biniamar");
[10:07:23] <FelicianoX> name='alojamiento' that's not an id
[10:07:36] <Godfather_> FelicianoX, see on the right of the name, i inserted an id
[10:07:45] <FelicianoX> Yeah i see it
[10:07:45] <Godfather_> <select name="alojamiento" id="alojamiento">
[10:07:51] <Segaja> FelicianoX: .val(#id) sounds like setting the value to #id
[10:07:54] <Gho5t> god i hate the jquery plugins search
[10:07:56] <Segaja> Godfather_: not the select
[10:07:56] <rawburt> hello, I'm using jQuery with CakePHP and I get this error when calling $('#id).datepicker(); 'Error: d(a).zIndex is not a function' in jquery-ui-1.8.6.custom.min.js line 499... any ideas?
[10:07:57] <Segaja> the option
[10:08:03] <FelicianoX> yeah my bad Segaja
[10:08:04] <_newb> my jquery ajax call returns HTML + JSON but the json object isn't recognized as an object... any suggestions?
[10:08:12] <Gho5t> how is it that i can search http://plugins.jquery.com/search/node for jqgrid and nothing comes up
[10:08:15] <FelicianoX> <option id="option1">bleh</option> etc.
[10:08:20] <Viliasas> Hello, i'm trying to make jQuery UI Dialog work like a tooltip on imagemap area. How could i position dialog near mouse. At the moment it positions only from window. Here's my function http://pastebin.com/1j1S9C1u
[10:08:25] <JKarsrud> _newb: how can you return BOTH html + json?
[10:08:29] <Segaja> right and then $('#option1').val()
[10:08:43] <Godfather_> Segaja, ?
[10:08:50] <Godfather_> i dont want to change the value of the option
[10:08:56] <Godfather_> i want to change the value of the select
[10:08:57] <FelicianoX> you're not changing it
[10:09:01] <Segaja> Godfather_: read what FelicianoX writes
[10:09:19] <_newb> JKarsrud: ajax fills a div with an image (src, imagemap), and below that a JSON object, that's being treated as text, i think.. instead of an object.

[10:09:20] <bot-t> rawburt, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:09:31] <Segaja> ah, i think i know that you want Godfather_
[10:10:00] <Segaja> you want to add a selected="selected" attribute to the option
[10:10:04] <JKarsrud> _newb: yes, probably because the response headers are set to html
[10:10:19] <Segaja> should be $('#option1').attr('selected', 'selected');
[10:10:25] <JKarsrud> returning two types of data in one response will always be kinda tricky
[10:10:27] <Segaja> or something like that
[10:10:36] <Godfather_> Segaja, this could be
[10:10:57] <Godfather_> i want instead the first option of the select is selected , select an another option
[10:11:32] <Segaja> Godfather_: than what i said
[10:11:38] <Segaja> give the option you want to select an id
[10:11:40] <FelicianoX> So like, automatically select option 3 when the page is loaded? do what he said
[10:11:58] <Segaja> and use $('#someid').attr('selected', 'selected');
[10:12:20] <noob> will table drag and drop jquery plugin work for columns as well?
[10:12:29] <_newb> JKarsrud: can i tell it to be both HTML & JSON?
[10:13:08] <noob> when i include the jquery script in my html it functions properly but if i include it in a different file and include the file in html
[10:13:12] <noob> javascript doesnt work
[10:13:34] <ravenzz> _newb can't you return the image url and the other stuffs as json?
[10:13:52] <Aple> Brodingo: Cycle isn't working as expected. Care to look at this barebones example and see what I'm doing wrong? http://pressedweb.com/example/cycle/
[10:13:54] <_newb> ravenzz: as two separate ajax calls?
[10:14:00] <ravenzz> same call
[10:14:19] <ravenzz> all the data you need in json format
[10:14:26] <noob> ravenzz any idea regarding my problem
[10:14:29] <ravenzz> what's wrong with that
[10:14:55] <noob> not working if i have my jscript in separate file and include the file in html
[10:14:59] <Godfather_> Segaja, http://pastebin.com/zXWiH3ZE
[10:14:59] <Godfather_> this doesnt work
[10:15:00] <_newb> ravenzz: dunno. :) i'll give it a try, though :D
[10:15:05] <noob> but it wokrs properly if i include that in html file
[10:15:16] <noob> the jscript i mean
[10:15:42] <_serial_> noob: are you trying to declare something before its implemented i wonder?
[10:16:31] <noob> i din get you
[10:16:38] <ravenzz> like json_encode(array("image" => array("url" => "http://foo.com/foo.png", "title" => "foo"), "misc" => array( OTHERDATA ) ));
[10:16:38] <Segaja> strange Godfather_ it should work... FelicianoX any idea?
[10:16:41] <noob> i have all y jquery script in one file
[10:16:44] <ravenzz> _newb ^
[10:16:45] <noob> my*
[10:17:01] <noob> and i have included that file in my .html
[10:17:03] <_serial_> basically are you calling jquery functions before jquery is included via the script tag?
[10:17:10] <noob> nope
[10:17:22] <Godfather_> Segaja, here theres info about it, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/314636/how-do-you-select-a-particular-option-in-a-select-element-in-jquery

[10:18:13] <_serial_> :)
[10:18:15] <Godfather_> Segaja, $('#alojamiento option:contains("Biniamar")');  should be something like this
[10:18:46] <noob> i can not give  ademo on this
[10:18:49] <noob> on jfiddle
[10:19:01] <noob> it is not possible to upload folders and stuff
[10:19:03] <ravenzz> a live example?
[10:19:11] <ravenzz> is it hosted somewhere?
[10:19:17] <noob> no
[10:19:21] <noob> local
[10:19:32] <noob> the problem is of including files very basic
[10:19:38] <Segaja> Godfather_: that is the filter. but the id should work
[10:19:50] <ravenzz> ok ask me again.. in One row :P
[10:20:02] <ravenzz> i didn't saw the question
[10:20:05] <ggarri> hi
[10:20:23] <ggarri> is there other way to do '$('.arrow:even')' ??
[10:20:33] <noob> if i have the jquery script in my html file everythigns okay but if i have the jquery script in a different javascript file and i include that file.. javascript is not working then
[10:20:34] <_serial_> noob: what does the error console tell you?
[10:20:48] <noob> its giving an error on the widget
[10:21:00] <_serial_> do you have firebug installed?
[10:21:04] <noob> that not related though its some other js file a lib basicaly
[10:21:06] <noob> yes
[10:21:18] <_serial_> what does the javascript console say?
[10:21:24] <ravenzz> noob is your code snippet within the ready() function ?
[10:21:41] <noob> yes
[10:21:51] <adv_> can i mix js and jquery inside <script> tags?
[10:22:00] <ravenzz> then answer to _serial_
[10:22:05] <noob> $("#usersettings").dialog is not a function
[10:22:22] <Godfather_> Segaja, can you see my page?
[10:22:27] <noob> which is a differnet js file a libraray thats not an issue i guess
[10:22:33] <nvictor> ey
[10:22:51] <nvictor> is there a way for making $.post() synchronous?
[10:22:52] <ravenzz> do you forgot the round parentheses?
[10:22:54] <kborchers> adv_: jQuery is JS
[10:23:07] <ravenzz> $("#usersettings").dialog();
[10:23:07] <Segaja> Godfather_: i just testet it. it works for me
[10:23:11] <Segaja> which page do you mean Godfather_ ?
[10:23:23] <Godfather_> i did it this using $('select[name=alojamiento]').val('Biniamar');   before, but in this page doesnt work
[10:23:30] <kborchers> nvictor: don't do that ... if you need post to be synchronous, you're doing it wrong
[10:23:43] <noob> okay it says the functions which i am trying to use are not definged
[10:23:44] <Segaja> Godfather_: i used the id stuff i gave you
[10:23:49] <nvictor> kborchers: ok :)

[10:25:47] <noob> yes
[10:25:55] <_serial_> hmm..
[10:25:57] <nvictor> kborchers: and the code that follows tests an error variable
[10:26:01] <itsme_really> i thought he was busting on somebody... his name is 'noob'....
[10:26:01] <noob> its in the same directory...this is a very weird problem
[10:26:07] <hariom> I have a link in iframe that when clicked, takes to a new page but it tries to load the new page in embedded window itself. How to load it in parent window?
[10:26:19] <kborchers> nvictor: so test your return in the success callback of post
[10:26:22] <nvictor> kborchers: and it succeeds all the time (even on error, because the data is not in yet)
[10:26:38] <nvictor> kborchers: yep, the callback :)
[10:26:42] <nvictor> kborchers: i mean :(
[10:27:00] <kborchers> the callback will not fire before the data has arrived
[10:27:06] <_serial_> noob: dont mean to offend, but when you include the path to your js code, is the correct?

[11:11:05] <dabear> seems there is a poling of an image involved
[11:11:16] <JKarsrud> ggarri: np, I know it worked ;) :D
[11:11:23] <ggarri> xD
[11:12:28] <JKarsrud> engaged: uhm, it's not even ajax, it does a full reload of the page.. Atleast it was here
[11:12:46] <engaged> its reloading the whole page on every number change?
[11:12:52] <swiggy> i have a series of checkboxs, and i want a function to fire if none of the checkboxs are selected - how would i do this?
[11:12:55] <engaged> for me it just displays a fake blurred image then a new number
[11:13:44] <djQuery> jeffsmykil: got it workin on my machine but having problem publishing it because of the stupid verizon router
[11:14:23] <pamelafoxx> (question) im using jquery plugins for tooltips and image lightboxes, but i don't want them for people browsing on small mobile screens. i have some JS that checks user agent but I could also check window width/height/total dimensions or both. any consensus on what is best?
[11:14:40] <swiggy> djQuery, your usually the man to help me - how do i tell if no checkbox's are selected?
[11:15:11] <zebarto> hi guys, got a question regarding an ajax request and calling "getResponseHeader" on the xhr object
[11:15:21] <JKarsrud> engaged: aha, I see, I though you meant somewhere else...
[11:15:28] <zebarto> I cannot receive the set-cookie header
[11:15:41] <zebarto> by calling xhr.getResponseHeader('set-cookie')
[11:15:53] <WebDragon|away> craziness. just felt virginia's earthquake (5.8) all the way up here in north delaware
[11:15:55] <JKarsrud> It's just looping throught the serviceRequestStreamArray set at the bottom of the page
[11:15:58] <dabear> engaged: there are functions addBlur, hideBlur and updateRequest in that page which you can look at
[11:16:05] <zebarto> but the header is set in the response
[11:16:18] <JKarsrud> at the bottom of the head, sorry
[11:16:23] <WebDragon|away> whole neighborhood's outside going WAT at each other, cuz none of them have ever been through one before apparently
[11:16:49] <djQuery> swiggy: $('input[type="checkbox"]':checked').length
[11:18:57] <engaged> dabear: got it, fake counter except for initial number
[11:18:58] <engaged> t
[11:18:58] <engaged> hanks
[11:19:55] <dabear> engaged: seems like they actually just fake it. for each 5 seconds they are calling addblur, then half a second after they are hiding it and increasing the counter with 1
[11:19:58] <dabear> so yeah
[11:21:01] <dabear> engaged: learn to use google chromes on subthree modification dom breakpoints
[11:21:13] <dabear> and the js beautifier builtin to chrome
[11:21:17] <dabear> and you would see that
[11:27:40] <adv_>  hm i'm using  $.post("http://127.0.0.1/proj/params.php", jsondata2); . $_POST['jsondata2'] is empty from the php page
[11:27:43] <adv_> any ideas?
[11:28:49] <swiggy> shouldnt it be
[11:28:58] <swiggy> 'jsondata2='+jsondata2
[11:29:53] <adv_> swiggy, can you elaborate?
[11:30:57] <orolo> is there a new css3 prefix creator? and is it jQuery? i read something about it but never bm'd it.
[11:32:19] <dabear> adv_: you are passing the contents of the variable jsondata to $.post
[11:32:44] <adv_> dabear, yes jsondata is just a string, it's not actual json data
[11:32:53] <adv_> var jsondata ="foo";
[11:33:18] <adv_> so how can i display the contents from the php file?
[11:33:36] <dabear> it cannot know what it should be called on the serverside
[11:33:48] <dabear> it needs to be serialized
[11:33:48] <ale> How can I check for duplicate id's? I have <p id="1"></p> <p id="2"></p> <p id="1"></p>...How can I check and delete one of the dupicated ids?
[11:34:07] <dabear> $.post("test.php", { foo:"John", time: "2pm" } );
[11:34:10] <dabear> for example
[11:34:25] <dabear> then $_POST["foo"] and "time" will be available
[11:34:56] <dabear> adv_: anyway, on the server you can do var_dump($_POST) to see the data
[11:35:10] <adv_> dabear, hm thanks but what if i have time as a js variable with the content already in?
[11:35:29] <dabear> adv_: foo: bar
[11:35:34] <dabear> {foo: bar}
[11:35:39] <dabear> if bar has the contents
[11:35:40] <swiggy> adv_ you need to serialize your data
[11:35:51] <swiggy> your server does not know what to 'call' your data
[11:36:01] <adv_> ah!
[11:36:02] <swiggy> $_POST[$key] => $value
[11:36:08] <swiggy> you need to set the $key
[11:36:13] <swiggy> you are only setting the value
[11:36:19] <dabear> ale: select all p's, sort them and do a loop after
[11:36:35] <dabear> if the last p had an id rqual to the current p, then it is a duplicate
[11:36:41] <MoTiOnXml> anyone here have experience customizing popups in tiny-mce?
[11:36:47] <swiggy> $_POST['name'] = 'foobar'     would be     var string = 'name=foobar';
[11:36:48] <ale> dabear: thanks
[11:37:27] <dabear> ale: .sort is available, but is not documented. it is similar ( or actually identical) to the array sort method
[11:37:28] <ale> dabear: should I use $.each?
[11:37:43] <dabear> so, see ?mdc array sort
[11:37:44] <bot-t> so, sort - MDN Docs - Sorts the elements of an array in place. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[11:38:56] <ale> dabear: but why should I short it? Actually, the id's are not number
[11:39:31] <kborchers> ale: the bigger question is why does your markup have duplicated id's to begin with?
[11:39:57] <adv_> thnaks guys
[11:40:47] <dabear> ale: ??
[11:41:23] <dabear> sorting makes sure that all elements following one and another arranged by id
[11:42:17] <dabear> if you have ten elements with ids 1,2,3,3,4,5,5,5,6,7 is is far easier to remove those duplicates
[11:42:35] <dabear> than if their sorting is random
[11:43:08] <danzik17> ale:  or you can do this - http://jsfiddle.net/HJLH2/
[11:43:52] <ale> danzik17: cool, thanks!
[11:44:42] <mightym> hey guys I'm trying to learn js and query by playing arroung with a safari extension… when calling alert($('html')); in my js i get a alert [object Object] which seems to my correct … but f.e. $('body').addClass('.rotate'); doesn't seem to have any effect
[11:44:58] <kborchers> ?alert @ mightym
[11:44:59] <bot-t> mightym, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[11:45:15] <SirCmpwn> ^++
[11:45:51] <jmar777> mightym: no . in addClass string
[11:45:59] <jmar777> mightym: e.g., $('body').addClass('rotate');
[11:46:23] <mightym> jmar777: ah … lets try this :-) thx a lot mate!
[11:46:34] <jmar777> mightym: np

[11:48:20] <dutton> hi all.. anyone good with external links in JQM?
[11:49:59] <dutton> When I link back from external back to the JQM site, the back button on the JQM for its previous page dissapears?  any ideas why and how to fix?
[11:50:20] <aka-fat> I have just been using $.when.apply($, promises) and I want to confirm there isn't a more "correct" way to do that.
[11:50:42] <grid_> hey
[11:51:37] <grid_> can somebody help me arround: http://jsfiddle.net/AdrVN/1/ ? once i resize the browser, the dialog has to picked the width and height from demo again
[11:52:08] <kborchers> aka-fat: no, i think that is the correct method
[11:53:38] <dabear> ale: and same for strings: http://jsfiddle.net/LS26y/1/
[11:53:44] <ale> thanks :D
[11:54:24] <dabear> there is as you see, many ways to accomplish ones goals
[11:54:40] <brianpWins> I'm sending an ajax request. that according to chromes network tab is sending a 200 ok response and the proper html/js i'm expecting but it's firing my failure callback ?
[11:55:01] <kborchers> ?demo @ brianpWins
[11:55:02] <bot-t> brianpWins, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:58:28] <aka-fat> kborchers: thanks for the confirmation :)
[11:58:55] <Bower^> I'm working with a web API that doesn't need a callback value in the GET request (at least examples don't show one) and when I make calls to it, I get an empty response within the firebug console. The status code indicates the query was successful so what am I missing here? Some links would be appreciated
[11:59:25] <Bower^> I'm using $.getJSON() btw
[11:59:26] <danzik17> kborchers:  Is there a quick wiki somewhere on those irc shortcuts?  Would certainly be handy for answering stuff
[12:00:47] <kborchers> danzik17: there used to be but it hasn't been up for months and don't even remember the URL. i just learned most of them from being in here all the time ;)
[12:01:52] <brianpWins> hmmm jsfiddle just makes my content disappear when I click anything lol
[12:02:45] <kborchers> danzik17: the ones i use most often are demo, p, g(does a google search) and then almost every bit of the api is accessible too like see ?ajax
[12:02:45] <bot-t> danzik17, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:02:45] <tiemonster> Is there a decent coverage tool for QUnit? JSCoverage doesn't seem to be maintained.
[12:03:30] <danzik17> kborchers:  Thanks - much easier than crawling the docs to get the links
[12:03:46] <detain> oh shit did 1.6.2 just come out ?
[12:03:57] <kborchers> much easier! very frustrating when the bot decides to take a nap which is pretty often :(
[12:04:02] <Rinthe> is it possible to get the image height and width from an image URL only? the image is not even loaded on the page yet.
[12:04:13] <gnarf> detain: 1.6.2 has been out for a while
[12:04:35] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[12:04:35] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[12:04:46] <gnarf> bot-t: Are you going to be here all day?
[12:04:46] <bot-t> gnarf, You may rely on it.
[12:04:47] <detain> honestly ? wow i feel kinda oblivious then.. i thought i stared at that title every day
[12:05:00] <kborchers> bot-t: why do you lie?
[12:05:01] <bot-t> kborchers, It is decidedly so.
[12:05:09] <gnarf> ?g jquery 1.6.2
[12:05:10] <bot-t> gnarf, jQuery:  jQuery 1.6.2 Released - http://blog.jquery.com/2011/06/30/jquery-162-released/
[12:05:26] <gnarf> 1.6.3 will prolly be out monday
[12:05:26] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/Y4Kgg/ -- how do i filter through the inputs to check to see if they are null/empty?
[12:05:32] <swiggy> .find or .each?
[12:05:50] <m1chael][> when using an auto complete feature with (let's say a huge customer database), how is the customer id selected and the customer name shown?
[12:06:01] <gnarf> swiggy: what do you want to do ?
[12:06:11] <gnarf> you might be able to just serialize the form
[12:06:15] <gnarf> ?serialize
[12:06:16] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[12:06:19] <gnarf> ?serializeArray
[12:06:19] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[12:06:37] <swiggy> for each input (checkbox, textbox) i want to check if they are null/empty before submitting the form
[12:06:58] <gnarf> and I assume tell the person which empty inputs they need to fill out?
[12:07:19] <swiggy> yes
[12:07:26] <swiggy> with $(this).focus()
[12:07:32] <swiggy> i would like :)
[12:07:37] <enjoycrf> hey
[12:07:38] <enjoycrf> how many pxls is a row
[12:07:39] <enjoycrf> textarea
[12:07:54] <gnarf> prolly better to use each then
[12:07:55] <kborchers> ?validate @ swiggy
[12:07:56] <bot-t> swiggy, Plugins/Validation/validate - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[12:07:58] <gnarf> but yeah
[12:08:02] <gnarf> look at a validation plugin
[12:08:05] <Bower^> Can someone please explain how I can get data from http://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/track.search?&apikey=008dd01ef8f4324fe1e9c60b0ea5a9d4&q_artist=Public+Enemy&q_track=Fight+the+power into my program? I've worked with two other APIs and they work fine because you specify the callback function in the URL but this API doesn't seem to work like that
[12:08:17] <swiggy> thank you but i dont want to use validate plugin
[12:08:55] <Bower^> I just get an empty response
[12:09:10] <Bower^> with a "successful" status code
[12:10:44] <Rinthe> is it possible to get the image height and width from an image URL only? the image is not even loaded on the page yet.
[12:11:10] <d4rklit3> h
[12:11:10] <d4rklit3> i
[12:11:37] <d4rklit3> so i have xml from .ajax call
[12:11:58] <swiggy> does ' break; '  break from an .each();
[12:12:13] <jmar777> swiggy: no
[12:12:20] <swiggy> how do i break out of an each?
[12:12:23] <d4rklit3> there is some data that looks like this <nodes><node id="1" /><node id="2" /></nodes>   I am trying to find <node> by its id attribute
[12:12:24] <swiggy> return false; doesnt end it
[12:12:26] <d4rklit3> how do i do this
[12:12:47] <swiggy> nevermind
[12:12:53] <swiggy> return false does break it
[12:12:56] <swiggy> must of forgot to save
[12:13:13] <swiggy> kborchers, gnarf -- http://jsfiddle.net/Y4Kgg/4/
[12:13:21] <swiggy> works perfect, without plugin :)
[12:13:25] <swiggy> very small code too
[12:13:55] <kborchers> swiggy: alert sucks and doesn't tell me what field is wrong or why.
[12:14:23] <ravenzz> swiggy just return; ?
[12:14:49] <kborchers> swiggy: and do you care if i enter forty-four in age or tomorrow as the date? your code won't validate that
[12:15:03] <ravenzz> swiggy with return false; you break the $.each() loop
[12:15:12] <ravenzz> "We can break the $.each() loop at a particular iteration by making the callback function return false. Returning non-false is the same as a continue statement in a for loop; it will skip immediately to the next iteration."
[12:15:32] <enjoycrf> how wide is the size or textarea col
[12:15:44] <enjoycrf> like textarea col="1"
[12:15:49] <enjoycrf> how many px is that
[12:15:58] <dutton> When I link back from external back to the JQM site, the back button on the JQM for its previous page dissapears?  any ideas why and how to fix?
[12:16:01] <dutton> hi all.. anyone good with external links in JQM?
[12:16:22] <kborchers> enjoycrf: why do you need to know? and i'm sure it's not the same across browsers
[12:16:23] <jmar777> swiggy: that will also force values on all inputs on the page, not just in the submitted form
[12:16:34] <Rinthe> is it possible to get the image height and width from an image URL only? the image is not even loaded on the page yet.
[12:16:40] <swiggy> kborchers, its a fiddle - you can adjust it to however you want to use it
[12:16:46] <swiggy> you do not need to take it 'serious'
[12:16:51] <enjoycrf> cause this wordwrap function takes that size
[12:16:54] <gnarf> enjoycrf: you can style textarea's with css width and heights
[12:16:59] <enjoycrf> i kno
[12:17:00] <enjoycrf> lol
[12:17:06] <enjoycrf> not a noob thx
[12:17:17] <gnarf> and you can read the width/height of the textarea with .width() and .height()
[12:17:24] <enjoycrf> omfg
[12:17:36] <ravenzz> Rinthe no
[12:18:34] <grid_> hey ravenzz
[12:18:51] <ravenzz> hey grid_
[12:19:28] <gnarf> enjoycrf: um... "textarea col="1" how many px is that"
[12:19:30] <gnarf> you asked
[12:19:46] <enjoycrf> no i didnt
[12:20:02] <gnarf> enjoycrf: not my fault you're asking noob questions :)
[12:20:21] <gnarf> so this isn't you: http://cl.ly/2V133Y222J1D1x38031Y
[12:20:31] <thinkt4nk> heh
[12:20:51] <enjoycrf> nope
[12:21:17] <jmar777> swiggy: maybe something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Y4Kgg/5/
[12:21:29] <grid_> ravenzz: i'm still doing a little tweak on the jquery code of yesterday, i made it a little bit smaller (will add the overlay again) now i want to get the height and width of the demo again to drag the window when i resize the browser, can you look http://jsfiddle.net/AdrVN/1/ ?
[12:21:59] <Bower^> Can someone please explain how I can get data from http://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/track.search?&apikey=008dd01ef8f4324fe1e9c60b0ea5a9d4&q_artist=Public+Enemy&q_track=Fight+the+power into my program? I've worked with two other APIs and they work fine because you specify the callback function in the URL but this API doesn't seem to work like that, I just get an error in my firebug console
[12:22:58] <tomasm-> anyone know if its possible to use jquery for dom manipulation in a tinymce plugin? tinymce has it's own dom tools that royally suck
[12:23:07] <ravenzz> grid_ you need to center the dialog when you resize the window?
[12:23:18] <SinnerNyx> is there a better ui tree then jstree (http://jstree.com)? jstree looks perfect but I'm a little hesitant using prereleases
[12:23:24] <jmar777> Bower^: looks like you need to specify format and callback: https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/input-parameters
[12:23:42] <enjoycrf> im trying to wordwrap dynamicly when resizing the textbox
[12:23:46] <enjoycrf> this is insane
[12:23:46] <jmar777> Bower^: e.g., http://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/track.search?&apikey=008dd01ef8f4324fe1e9c60b0ea5a9d4&q_artist=Public+Enemy&q_track=Fight+the+power&format=JSONP&callback=foo
[12:24:37] <Bower^> I'm so sure I tried it with a callback in the GET request like that and it didn't work. I never actually spotted that on the page though so I'll have another crack
[12:24:39] <Bower^> thanks jmar777
[12:24:40] <grid_> ravenzz: no, if you first open the browser you can drag the window in the size of the div demo, when you resize your browser it will pick another size you can drag it, it should get the new size and width with a resize of the browser again
[12:25:41] <detain> do buttonset()'s have to be created seperately , or can i put a class on all of them and declare them all at once  (without them being linked together as a single buttonset)
[12:26:05] <grid_> ravenzz: so it has to set the size again in the variable somehow, like it does in the beginning, the first launch
[12:26:10] <ravenzz> grid_ oh i see..but i am sorry i have to go, we may figure it out tomorrow, or just ask to someone else
[12:26:48] <grid_> ravenzz: sure, hopefully someone will read with us, see you tomorrow :)
[12:27:15] <SinnerNyx> is there a better ui tree then jstree (http://jstree.com)? jstree looks perfect but I'm a little hesitant using prereleases

[12:27:27] <Rinthe> http://codepad.org/B2yr1vrt why isn't the image loading?
[12:27:50] <enleth> Hi. I'm looking into QUnit right now, and while it does seem nice for checking "backend" code that does something and returns a result to be asserted, there are apparently no examples, articles or any other coverage for unittesting code that actually does something in a webpage. Any pointers here?
[12:30:10] <enleth> Other JS unit test packages I'm looking at also give those naive "check if the function returns 1" examples without regard to how JS is actually used - inside an existing page, not a testing interface that outputs a series of test results.
[12:31:43] <Bower^> jmar777, http://jsfiddle.net/JGAr6/ - can you see anything wrong with that?
[12:32:46] <Rinthe> aynoen?
[12:33:51] <Behl> Hi, I'm building a plugin for lazy loading of groups of elements and I'm running in to some trouble. What I'm trying to do is feed the plugin with data that needs to be loaded in to some divs as well as some settings so I can control how they are loaded. Thing is, I have no clue how to go about this and the documentation is not giving me anything. http://jsfiddle.net/TobiasBerg/wZfRj/3/ Bear in mind that I just started using jQuery :) Any help would
[12:33:52] <Behl> greatly appreciated.
[12:34:07] <ggarri>  how I could avoid that a div catch the event focus ?
[12:34:15] <ggarri> for example when you have 2 divs in the same position and you want to just one take the focus event

[12:43:43] <jeffsmykil> is there a good way to round a number in javascript without if statements
[12:44:36] <razzi> yeah Math.floor
[12:44:39] <thinkt4nk> Math.floor
[12:44:40] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: Math.round() ?
[12:44:49] <jeffsmykil> oh forgot abll about math.floor
[12:44:57] <jeffsmykil> ty

[12:45:11] <razzi> hey
[12:45:12] <grid_> whats up?
[12:45:27] <razzi> not much, u?
[12:45:46] <razzi> did you solve that dialog problem?
[12:45:47] <grid_> not much, just idle here
[12:46:14] <grid_> parts of it
[12:46:30] <razzi> your first idea whould work
[12:46:34] <grid_> not finished yet
[12:46:50] <razzi> get w/h of window, then set the drag area
[12:47:21] <matt_sa> how do I get the HTML of a jquery object? .html() captures the innerHTML of the object, but not the object (or outer div) itself
[12:48:01] <tbranyen> matt_sa: there are a few one liners for that
[12:48:14] <grid_> razzi: i came to this right now http://jsfiddle.net/AdrVN/1/ only thing is it has to get the width and height again in the var when the browser will resize
[12:48:34] <matt_sa> tbranyen: what would you suggest?
[12:48:46] <grid_> razzi: i remade the demo div
[12:49:17] <grid_> i could bound it to the body, html of document also, but that's not the best way i could work with
[12:49:31] <razzi> macabre you problably could do it yourself using js .nodeName()
[12:49:45] <razzi> matt_sa*
[12:50:26] <matt_sa> razzi: .nodeName is a method for what object?
[12:50:45] <razzi> js dom elements
[12:51:04] <matt_sa> yeah, $("#foo")[0].nodeName() doesn't exist
[12:51:29] <razzi> sorry, no brackets
[12:51:36] <razzi> it's a property, not a method
[12:51:57] <matt_sa> razzi: right, and all I get back is "DIV". not the actual div class or contents of it....
[12:52:25] <razzi> didn't you want something like <div> innerthtml </div> ?
[12:52:34] <razzi> if not, i misunderstood you
[12:52:52] <kborchers> matt_sa: what are you trying to do? depending on that you could try ?clone
[12:53:01] <kborchers> ?clone @ matt_sa
[12:53:02] <bot-t> matt_sa, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[12:53:03] <matt_sa> razzi: <div class="foo"><h1>something</h1></div> yet if I do $(".foo")[0].innerHTML or $(".foo").text(), I only get <h1>something</h1>, not the div itself
[12:53:22] <matt_sa> kborchers: sorry, i'm just trying to get the text from a jquery object - not anything nested within it
[12:53:29] <razzi> hmm yeah getting all the attributes might be tricky
[12:54:04] <matt_sa> well… i just want a single string of all the HTML from that jquery object
[12:54:05] <matt_sa> that's all
[12:54:23] <grid_> razzi: can you think with me how i could set the size again (in the variable) the size where you can drag the dialog, when the browser will resize? there are options like dragStart: function() { etc
[12:55:41] <razzi> grid_ what was the original issue again?
[12:56:46] <razzi> matt_sa try kborchers suggestion, clone it
[12:57:02] <grid_> i asked in the first place how i could work withit in combination with the ie8 issue, you know it drags there behind the edges of the browser, it will mess up jquery background plugins
[12:57:06] <matt_sa> razzi: what the hell would i do with a clone I couldn't get from the original object… ?
[12:57:10] <razzi> put it inside another div, select div and get html
[12:57:39] <jmar777> Bower^: sorry, was afk
[12:57:42] <jmar777> looks right to me
[12:57:46] <Bower^> I got it working man
[12:58:02] <Bower^> instead of callback : '?' I just added it to the URL
[12:58:03] <Bower^> :)
[12:58:14] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/ADkHm/  I'm trying to toggle div's depending on radio checkbox selection.   Is there a better way to go about doing it (my example is working)
[12:58:25] <grid_> razzi: it must stay now in demo, that div, it will always resize perfect this demo div, but the dialog will not get the size accordingly when the browser gets a resize
[12:58:26] <jmar777> Bower^: oh ya, missed that. good catch
[12:58:47] <kborchers> matt_sa: if you just want the html then try this $("<div>").append("#foo").html();
[12:58:51] <Bower^> Thanks the input anyway man, always appreciated :)
[12:58:55] <Bower^> for the*
[12:58:55] <razzi> grid, is there going to a fullsized div in your final page too?
[12:59:11] <enleth> A follow-up to the previous question: is there a JS testing framework (preferably using QUnit) that would load a page in a frame, perform tests on it and report the result? So I don't have to include the tests in the page itself, but can see the results of the test as if I were manually using the page.
[13:00:29] <grid_> razzi: this div will be in my final page, but i may just hide it until the dialog will show up, i will use .hide() and .show() for that
[13:00:46] <grid_> i will probably remove the border 1px too
[13:01:12] <grid_> it's just there to get a visual look right now
[13:01:13] <matt_sa> kborchers: is there an easy way to remove a .wrap() tag?
[13:01:20] <matt_sa> or just set the HTML to innerHTML i guess
[13:02:17] <kborchers> matt_sa: right, just do $("#foo").replaceWith($("#foo").html()); i think should work
[13:02:49] <Guest78810> I have a quick question about tablesorter if anyone is up for it.
[13:02:51] <grid_> razzi: do you get my goal?
[13:03:04] <matt_sa> kborchers: you'd think this would be a common thing...
[13:04:21] <kborchers> matt_sa: sorry forgot about see ?unwrap

[13:04:54] <CyberK_Muenchen> hallo
[13:04:58] <CyberK_Muenchen> i have question
[13:05:06] <razzi> grid_, yeah
[13:05:40] <CyberK_Muenchen> what can i doing, if i will open 2th Tab with jQuery after FORM_send?
[13:06:56] <CyberK_Muenchen> i work with 2 tabs with 2 FORMs... and if i send from second form daten it would be open first tab automatish... ((
[13:08:28] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/ADkHm/  I'm trying to toggle div's depending on radio checkbox selection.  Is there a better way to go about doing it (my example is working)
[13:10:59] <CyberK_Muenchen> it must be only with jqTAB...

[13:15:21] <dutton> anybody good with JQM?
[13:15:25] <jeffsmykil> someone remind me how to combine two .css functions on the same element?
[13:16:13] <SirCmpwn> http://google.com/search?q=combine+.css+functions+same+element
[13:17:24] <dutton> has there been any movement on the back button issue on JQM?  is there any way to just link backwards and forwards with  hrefs instead? the ajax caching doesnt really seem to work well as the button dissapears if the page is refreshed
[13:19:03] <grid_> razzi: yes, that is doing it, how strange i just came myself with a solution also :) but your solution is more good
[13:19:26] <b1lly> does this json object look right http://pastie.org/2418542
[13:19:34] <razzi> what did you do?
[13:20:36] <dabear> b1lly: http://jsonlint.com/
[13:20:39] <dabear> check there
[13:21:05] <dabear> no, is the short answer
[13:21:16] <Glasswalker> Hey, I have the following javascript: http://pastebin.com/44Eyi7Sj the problem is the outer json query (setshipcontact) is being executed, but the inner query (getshiptypes) is not being executed at all
[13:21:52] <Glasswalker> According to dev tools in chrome if I put a breakpoint at line2 there, the code never reaches the breakpoint.
[13:22:08] <Glasswalker> But the server does show successful hit against /ajax/setshipcontact
[13:22:22] <Glasswalker> Any idea why?
[13:22:48] <Glasswalker> (I'm cascading them like this because I want setshipcontact to complete (commit data to db) before I then query the available ship types)
[13:23:57] <julioalbertodeho> Hi, i got a question, i'm using cross domain ajax with jsonp and i'm getting a text/html response, how can i process that response?
[13:25:43] <dabear> Glasswalker: that's kinda difficult to say. errors like these might occur if an ajax call is made to a remote domain, though
[13:25:52] <dabear> ?dermo @ Glasswalker
[13:25:53] <bot-t> Glasswalker, UI/API/1.8/Accordion - Make the selected elements Accordion widgets. Semantic requirements: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[13:26:01] <dabear> ?demo @ Glasswalker
[13:26:01] <bot-t> Glasswalker, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:26:37] <kborchers> Glasswalker: what does setshipcontact return? if it's not returning JSON, that call is failing and your success callback is not firing. you probably shouldn't be using getJSON to update the DB but use see ?ajax
[13:26:38] <bot-t> Glasswalker, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:27:03] <kborchers> or get or post just not getJSON
[13:31:41] <julioalbertodeho> anyone?
[13:32:57] <tomasm-> is it possible to get one controller to 'redirect' to another controller while still preserving $this->data ? i have an items controller and item_requests controller, and upon adding an item_request it should show the main page with the list and the add form
[13:36:52] <tomasm-> oops, wrong channel
[13:37:26] <kborchers> julioalbertodeho: i believe if you play with the dataType option of .ajax() you can get that to work. see ?ajax
[13:37:27] <bot-t> julioalbertodeho, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:39:49] <matt_sa> besides using else clauses, is there any way to make ajax requests synchronous?
[13:39:53] <matt_sa> lol
[13:39:55] <matt_sa> nevermind!
[13:40:49] <kborchers> matt_sa: you should not do that. synchronous ajax is an oxymoron since the first A stands for Asynchronous. it just created a bad user experience
[13:41:19] <SirCmpwn> you could
[13:41:29] <julioalbertodeho> well, let me explain better, i'm doing a cross domain ajax request with dataType:'jsonp', but the response i get is in text/html format, i get a syntax error because the response is html, so when i check the response on firebug's network tab i can see the html but i don't know how to process it
[13:41:30] <SirCmpwn> makeRequest(); while (!isDone()) { }
[13:42:13] <kborchers> julioalbertodeho: try dataType: "jsonp html"
[13:42:29] <julioalbertodeho> ok, let me try
[13:45:46] <oal> I can't seem to understand all the asynchronous stuff in javascript... Or I do think I get it, but it always fails when I try to use it. Is there a good, short, concise guide explaining it?
[13:47:42] <Flayks> hi there
[13:48:08] <Flayks> it's possible to avoid the multiple parent() in my js ? http://jsfiddle.net/Flayks/y9e2A/
[13:48:32] <lordcaos> Hello
[13:49:33] <danzik17> Flayks: $(this).closest('div.select')
[13:51:04] <Flayks> danzik17: oh yes... great
[13:51:06] <chipnt> Hi everyone. I need to know how can i pass javascript variables "compte" and "uid" to a .load request: $('#ajaxreponsec').load('mypage.php?compte='compte'&uid='uid); <- what do i need to fix here
[13:51:15] <kborchers> Flayks: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/y9e2A/1/
[13:51:52] <Flayks> kborchers: ok, closest is the solution... thanks a lot :)
[13:53:18] <mwarning> Hi, I try to load some dome using $('#content').load(url + " #main"); while the content get's inserted, the code from <script> tag doesn't seem to be included or even executed. Any idea what happens?
[13:58:57] <julioalbertodeho> It doesn't work
[14:00:23] <CodeZombie> could use someone elses head for a moment... I've got a table... you can view it here: http://dev.codezombie.org:3000/admin this table, has nested elements. When you click the up/down buttons in a row, that row should move up/down respectively. However, I can't seem to figure out how to take into account the nested elements when using jquery. Suggestions would be welcome, this is my second day on this problem, and I Just seem to be going in circles.
[14:00:26] <julioalbertodeho> when i use dataType : 'jsonp html', it doesn't return anyr response
[14:00:37] <mattp_> _.max(_.flatten(raw.history), function(val) { return val[1]; });
[14:00:55] <mattp_> when i use underscore, does this always return the true value of raw.history immediately?
[14:01:00] <mattp_> or do i need to do that function compile thing
[14:02:28] <CodeZombie> I thought about doing a full table re-render after the ajax call, but that seems a bit much
[14:02:42] <CodeZombie> might as well skip ajax at that point
[14:03:11] <limeyd> CodeZombie: do you have control of the html?
[14:03:17] <CodeZombie> limeyd: yes
[14:03:58] <limeyd> then why not actually nest the content
[14:04:19] <CodeZombie> I did try nesting it under a tbody tag, to group the rows.. however, I came across 2 issues
[14:04:39] <CodeZombie> 1) When wrapping the parent, and it's children in a tbody tag, they were no longer "siblings" of the rest of the rows...
[14:04:47] <julioalbertodeho> ...
[14:05:11] <CodeZombie> 2) when wrapping just the nested elements, the "root level" rows were able to get between the parent, and the nested rows.
[14:05:38] <limeyd> how about using a ul/li and a table for each row
[14:05:39] <CodeZombie> https://gist.github.com/1163957
[14:05:52] <CodeZombie> ouch
[14:05:58] <CodeZombie> that sounds like a pain
[14:06:02] <CodeZombie> haha
[14:06:11] <limeyd> really?
[14:06:30] <limeyd> the js would be easier
[14:06:44] <limeyd> and the html/css would be more complex
[14:06:57] <CodeZombie> that would also cause issues between my search box, and the table... since I would now have to search multiple tables
[14:08:36] <limeyd> how deep can the nesting go?
[14:08:43] <CodeZombie> infinite
[14:08:51] <CodeZombie> not ideal, but it's a requirement
[14:09:00] <kborchers> julioalbertodeho: can you show me your code and a link to the JSONP source? see ?p
[14:09:00] <bot-t> julioalbertodeho, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:09:02] <RobW> anyone have suggestions for what plugin to handle swiping with?

[14:09:53] <SirCmpwn> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/mobile-events-documentation
[14:10:01] <limeyd> you could id a row and give each child a class of the row and move all rows down/up by one with the given class
[14:10:54] <GoGoGarrett> I'm trying to validate a form, I have 2 radio buttons that hide/show div's depending on the one clicked,  I want to validate the one that's showing, but disregard anything that's not.. how do I go about doing that?  I'm using the .validate plugin
[14:11:08] <CodeZombie> limeyd: that just might work
[14:11:15] <CodeZombie> I'll play around with that, thanks
[14:11:25] <limeyd> CodeZombie: that would move children then give each level a class and prior to moving get all rows of the level
[14:12:13] <limeyd> CodeZombie: insert after next('.some level class')
[14:12:31] <_newb> Error: JSON.parse: bad control character in string literal ... is there any way to debug which bad character this might be?

[14:13:00] <CodeZombie> ha!
[14:13:03] <mbutubuntu> hello folks

[14:13:28] <TomLeyton> hey question, if an element is hidden (with .hide), if I use .find, will it find it?
[14:14:05] <enjoycrf> this.text.replace(/\n/, " ");
[14:14:10] <enjoycrf> something is up
[14:14:11] <Segaja> TomLeyton: you should. .find looks in the DOM tree and the hidden element is still in that tree
[14:14:31] <enjoycrf> does that need escaping?
[14:14:35] <enjoycrf> this.text.replace(/\n/, " ");
[14:14:49] <julioalbertodeho> or here http://jsfiddle.net/FmgZA/
[14:14:57] <TomLeyton> thanks
[14:15:18] <Segaja> enjoycrf: i would say yes
[14:15:27] <enjoycrf> how
[14:15:36] <Segaja> /\\n/
[14:15:41] <enjoycrf> i tried that
[14:15:46] <Segaja> and?
[14:15:47] <enjoycrf> it got even weirder
[14:15:51] <enjoycrf> is that correct
[14:16:08] <Segaja> hm it would be my guess
[14:16:48] <Segaja> did you try .replace("\n", " "); ?
[14:16:52] <Segaja> without the regex
[14:17:09] <enjoycrf> no
[14:17:10] <enjoycrf> thx
[14:17:24] <enjoycrf> i keep overthinking it
[14:17:30] <enjoycrf> ive mede this mistake before
[14:17:38] <Segaja> i don't know it will work
[14:17:39] <enjoycrf> i jus <3 using regexp
[14:18:14] <Segaja> someone said to me a while back: Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.
[14:18:56] <enjoycrf> yeah thats ppl who dont know regexp
[14:19:10] <kborchers> julioalbertodeho: not sure how to get that working
[14:19:49] <TonyWanis> Hello

[15:13:20] <CannedCorn> if i wanted to use smoothness i would just embed this? <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css" type="text/javascript"></script>
[15:13:27] <limeyd> the images for rollovers right
[15:13:59] <CannedCorn> yeah it's still not working
[15:14:00] <CannedCorn> hrm
[15:14:02] <limeyd> no link it http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css
[15:14:06] <CannedCorn> anything i can check
[15:14:12] <CannedCorn> link it?
[15:14:14] <CannedCorn> oh right
[15:14:15] <CannedCorn> it's not js
[15:14:23] <limeyd> lol
[15:14:33] <FLeiXiuS> Im getting clearInterval(); undefined..is this normal?
[15:16:44] <limeyd> CannedCorn: ok i got it working http://pastie.org/2419046
[15:16:51] <CannedCorn> yup
[15:16:55] <CannedCorn> got it, thanks guys
[15:16:59] <limeyd> np
[15:17:01] <CannedCorn> it was totally that I wasn't linking
[15:17:10] <CannedCorn> you are the man!
[15:17:12] <CannedCorn> thanks so much
[15:17:30] <limeyd> some days i where the thinkers cap other days not so much
[15:17:37] <limeyd> *wear
[15:17:42] <limeyd> see i lod you
[15:17:46] <CannedCorn> can you add text overlay to this thing
[15:17:54] <CannedCorn> like % inside
[15:18:55] <limeyd> you'd have to do that yourself a append the html to #progressbar
[15:20:02] <limeyd> and probably set the two divs to postition:absolute
[15:21:47] <limeyd> CannedCorn: you could roll your own and basically have a background-positioned:-N% and text in there
[15:21:54] <SEJeff> I've got a div that is hidden / selected using slideToggle()
[15:22:03] <SEJeff> That div contains a text input
[15:22:29] <SEJeff> I'm trying to run $(...textinput).focus() in the slideToggle() callback so that once the slideToggle is complete and the input is visible, focus it
[15:22:34] <SEJeff> what is the right way to do that?
[15:23:15] <CannedCorn> limeyd ok cool
[15:24:02] <limeyd> CannedCorn: goodluck
[15:24:26] <dravekx> anybody good with jQuery tabs? I need a little script help. :S
[15:27:07] <dravekx> I need to make these into tabs: http://jsfiddle.net/37Khy/4/
[15:27:57] <guy> can jquery convert object-array to JSON?
[15:33:44] <impi> hello, i have to construct url where i add #cat=12  or ?prod=10 and i am already using https://github.com/allmarkedup/jQuery-URL-Parser but it seems like i am building it wrong..is there perhaps a better solution?
[15:35:37] <dravekx> why isnt this working? http://jsfiddle.net/37Khy/8/
[15:37:01] <Kaapa> hey there - I'm facing this issue with jquery 1.6: http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/issues/detail?id=621 . For some reason, now document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]
[15:37:15] <Kaapa> sometimes returns undefined (sorry for the newline)
[15:40:11] <FLeiXiuS> Is there an event that happens before ajax:loading
[15:40:21] <dravekx> ugh
[15:40:26] <dravekx> why do I have no tabs....
[15:42:55] <impi> dravekx, your tabs are screwed man..
[15:43:01] <impi> checkout jquery ui tabs
[15:43:06] <impi> or jquery tools tabs
[15:43:19] <impi> it's easier...and even your markup+css is not right
[15:44:06] <impi> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[15:44:08] <mrchess`> anyone know if .bind() is busted in jquery 1.6.2 for binding drag events?

[16:01:48] <michael-i> Hi all. I'm wondering if I can still somehow access the returned data in an .ajax call when the return code is error: 409? My web service returns meaningful data along with those codes and I see the error() callback does not have access to it.
[16:11:07] <discountrobot> is there a smart chrome app that lets you turn  javascript on/off without the NoScript hassle?

[16:57:43] <daleharvey> does anyone know what <script type="text/javascript" src="https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js"> {lang: 'en-GB'} </script> does?
[16:58:07] <daleharvey> in javascript terms
[16:58:54] <coldhead> it loads that JS into your page
[16:58:56] <coldhead> from google
[16:58:59] <coldhead> >: \
[16:59:20] <daleharvey> yes, but what does the json contents do
[17:01:33] <coldhead> i would guess it sets the language to english (great britain)
[17:01:37] <coldhead> but how i do not know
[17:06:54] <danheberden> daleharvey it just loads the plusone.js file - the {land: 'en-GB'} part isn't parsed by the browser because you supplied a src attr
[17:07:06] <danheberden> it get's manually found and parsed by the plusone.js script
[17:09:11] <coldhead> how does it do that?
[17:09:17] <coldhead> crazy magic?
[17:09:39] <danheberden> coldhead there's a magic wand involved, yes
[17:09:44] <danheberden> speaking of which, would you like a werthers?
[17:09:55] <daleharvey> ah yeh, its that eval( scripts[ scripts.length - 1 ].innerHTML ); thing
[17:10:09] <daleharvey> cheers, I thought I recognised it, but was a little wtf for a moment
[17:10:35] <danheberden> that code looks completely impervious to errors
[17:10:57] <daleharvey> well JSON.parse in this case :P
[17:11:48] <abjorn> coldhead help me
[17:11:53] <abjorn> i think my personal trainer is trying to kill me :(
[17:12:14] <danheberden> ( with a magic wand, no doubt )
[17:12:22] <abjorn> Nope, with a smile on his face.
[17:15:30] <imsky> oh
[17:15:34] <imsky> hello there sir
[17:15:43] <fayimora> hiya
[17:16:23] <coldhead> lol abjorn
[17:16:31] <coldhead> you deserve death for having a personal trainer
[17:16:37] <coldhead> ACCEPT WHO YOU ARE
[17:16:46] <imsky> a natural born wigglar?
[17:17:22] <coldhead> TESTIFY
[17:21:09] <abjorn> coldhead i do not :(
[17:21:16] <abjorn> and no imsky, i cant even wiggle ;-;
[17:21:23] <imsky> WE MUST WIGGLE
[17:21:26] <imsky> FOR HUMANITY
[17:27:44] <RobertV> anyone know if it's possible to export an HTML5 canvas into an image or at least save the pixel state to a variable?
[17:28:04] <coldhead> it's possible
[17:28:09] <coldhead> google knows a lot more about it :)
[17:33:33] <tbranyen> RobertV: sure, you can get a base64 version of it
[17:33:46] <tbranyen> you can get the raw image data as well
[17:40:45] * abjorn struggles to wiggle
[17:40:48] <abjorn> i did all i could imsky
[17:41:34] <imsky> lol
[17:41:37] <imsky> are you having
[17:41:41] <imsky> a difficult time wiggling
[17:42:50] <abjorn> I am
[17:42:53] <abjorn> it's a travesty
[17:43:18] <imsky> lol
[17:43:24] <imsky> work keeping you down?
[17:48:08] <GoGoGarrett> I have 5 radio check boxes (1 - 5) to rate 5 different options, and I don't want any of those 5 options to contain the same vote value,  how would I go about doing this?
[17:48:25] <GoGoGarrett> input:radio -> each function ->>
[17:50:08] <imsky> err
[17:50:19] <seancurtis> GoGoGarrett: can you explain the problem a bit better?
[17:50:45] <GoGoGarrett> Sure thing. http://jsfiddle.net/A86zR/ here's my fiddle
[17:50:50] <seancurtis> <input type="radio" name="vote" value="1" />
[17:51:20] <GoGoGarrett> I have agency a-e.  You can vote 1-5 for each of them, but for each Agency a - b - c -e ect, I don't want them to be able to vote the same number for all of them (example, no 5'5'5'5'5)
[17:51:34] <seancurtis> why not?
[17:51:43] <GoGoGarrett> Just what my client asked for
[17:52:12] <seancurtis> so what they really want is a 1-5 and the clients as the option?
[17:52:36] <seancurtis> sorry - rating the Agency by 1-5?
[17:52:51] <GoGoGarrett> yeah, rate the agency 1 - 5, (it's like a voting form)
[17:52:56] <GoGoGarrett> and he wants each agency to be unique
[17:54:14] <imsky> hmm
[17:54:21] <imsky> seems like you shouldn't be using jquery
[17:54:25] <imsky> this is an html problem
[17:55:03] <GoGoGarrett> how would I go about fixing it within pure html?
[17:55:13] <imsky> easy
[17:55:19] <imsky> instead of "agency"->rating mapping
[17:55:24] <imsky> do rating->"agency" mapping
[17:56:11] <GoGoGarrett> Explain more so, I'm not fully understanding
[17:56:22] <seancurtis> imsky: still doesn't stop you selecting the same agency for multiple ratings
[17:56:34] <imsky> seancurtis: yeah BUT WE'LL DO IT LIVE
[17:56:39] <b1lly> lets say I had a object like this http://pastie.org/2419660      , how would I return 252352.cash (value)
[17:58:00] <seancurtis> once selected you need to disable it from the other options
[17:58:22] <b1lly> json object *
[17:58:23] <GoGoGarrett> So if they select say "value 5" from group 1
[17:58:27] <GoGoGarrett> disable all value 5's in all other gorus?
[17:58:31] <GoGoGarrett> groups*
[17:58:47] <GoGoGarrett> thanks, I'll work with that idea and see what I can do, good idea. :]
[17:58:55] <imsky> hmm
[17:58:59] <imsky> if you did do it with jquery
[17:59:06] <imsky> it'd be possible to make a cleaner interface
[17:59:25] <GoGoGarrett> I didn't design or create the web page, i was contracted stricly to make it functional :
[17:59:25] <GoGoGarrett> :/
[17:59:50] <coldhead> maybe you should use a functional language like clojurescript then
[17:59:56] <coldhead> or a lib like underscore
[17:59:57] <imsky> WAT
[17:59:58] <coldhead> har har har
[18:00:07] <coldhead> SHUT UP U ALL
[18:00:13] <imsky> clojurescript oh lord
[18:00:20] <imsky> jaboscript IS functional
[18:00:34] <imsky> remember thy crockford
[18:01:02] <b1lly> how do i return the value of an object? when i do an alert it just alerts ("[Object object]")
[18:01:13] <imsky> objects don't have values lolwat
[18:01:19] <coldhead> crockford i go to for weight loss advice moreso than lambda
[18:01:37] <imsky> snob
[18:01:41] <coldhead> b1lly: provide a toString method
[18:02:02] <coldhead> i'm about as much of a snob as he was a fatty
[18:02:06] <coldhead> which is quite a lot
[18:02:46] <imsky> at least he wrote a guide
[18:03:02] <coldhead> illustrated guide
[18:04:08] <imsky> lol you're a crockford iconoclast
[18:04:12] <imsky> a new breed of js hipsters
[18:04:20] <b1lly> coldhead: hmm?
[18:04:31] <b1lly> http://pastie.org/2419660
[18:04:48] <seancurtis> GoGoGarrett: something like this - but you need to return available radio options back into the pool: http://jsfiddle.net/A86zR/5/
[18:05:12] <seancurtis> GoGoGarrett: eg if you choose 1 for Agency 1, 2 for Agency 2 but then go and change Agency 1 to 3
[18:05:18] <seancurtis> the rating 1 is not returned
[18:05:26] <seancurtis> should be an easy fix though
[18:05:39] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks a lot man, :]
[18:05:43] <seancurtis> :)
[18:10:10] <b1lly> do i need to do something to my object
[18:10:27] <b1lly> before i can return a object.blah ;?
[18:10:44] <coldhead> object = new object()
[18:10:57] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[18:11:26] <imsky> close one
[18:25:38] <coldhead> cool borges doodle
[18:26:11] <imsky> link me brah
[18:27:37] <coldhead> http://www.google.com.au/logos/2011/jorge_luis_borges-2011-hp.jpg
[18:30:52] <imsky> wat a champ
[18:31:13] <GoGoGarrett> seancurtis http://jsfiddle.net/A86zR/6/  this solution, sucks.  I tried doing if attr disabled, remove attr disabled,  but I couldn't get it to work, how can I allow them to uncheck and let the value be used again
[18:32:03] <imsky> hahahaha
[18:32:10] <imsky> i love the phrase
[18:32:14] <imsky> "this solution sucks"
[18:32:21] <GoGoGarrett> haha, honest.
[18:32:23] <PrgmrBill> there was a dramatic pause too
[18:32:27] <PrgmrBill> this solution<comma> sucks
[18:32:44] <GoGoGarrett> exactly as was meant to be read. haa
[18:33:28] <coldhead> seancurtis: YOU SUCKS
[18:34:42] <imsky> EVERYTHING SUCKS
[18:34:47] <imsky> WE'LL DO IT LIVE
[18:35:11] <seancurtis> GoGoGarrett: :(
[18:35:46] <GoGoGarrett> Basically what I need to do is, = if this number is currently disabled, remove the disabled, and disable the one that was currently selected
[18:35:55] <GoGoGarrett> :/ give me a few more minutes i'll tinker some more
[18:38:01] <johnwarren> What's the best way for jQuery to grab the last number in a CSS selector value, like the -23 in "background-position: 0 -23"? I feel like I should know this but I can't remember.
[18:38:46] <coldhead> ?eval '0 -23'.split(' ')[1]
[18:38:47] <bot-t> coldhead: "-23"
[18:39:32] <snover> ?eval /([0-9-.]+)$/.exec('background-position: 0 -23')[1]
[18:39:32] <bot-t> snover: "-23"
[18:39:47] * seancurtis grumbles about helping people in here then being told the solution SUCKS
[18:39:58] <snover> YOU SUCK
[18:40:04] <GoGoGarrett> no, not your solution sucks
[18:40:09] <GoGoGarrett> My solution with a reset button
[18:40:17] <min|dvir|us> Hi. I was wondering if resizing a window also resizes document.
[18:40:23] <coldhead> i think everyone agrees that seancurtis sucks
[18:40:32] <johnwarren> Oh ok! Thanks, I don't think anyone sucks. But JSLint will tell me not to use "eval"
[18:40:33] <coldhead> it's an unrelated matter
[18:40:59] <min|dvir|us> Anyone?
[18:40:59] <johnwarren> ok
[18:42:11] <seancurtis> coldhead: :(
[18:43:55] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/A86zR/7/  <- I'm almost there haha
[18:44:13] <coldhead> sorry seancurtis, wrong window
[18:44:21] <coldhead> seancurtis is ne plus ultra
[18:44:50] <min|dvir|us> Where is .clean called?
[18:45:00] <min|dvir|us> Furthermore, what does it do?
[18:47:17] <dravekx> help.
[18:48:19] <dravekx> I need to take this code http://jsfiddle.net/37Khy/12/ and make it look like this (or similar): http://i.imgur.com/uXJcV.png can someone help?
[18:49:41] <seancurtis> GoGoGarrett: here, I hope this one doesn't SUCK: http://jsfiddle.net/A86zR/8/
[18:49:58] <GoGoGarrett> seancurtis i never said your solution sucked, I was talking about MY code, where I had just put a reset button
[18:50:01] <GoGoGarrett> your code helped me tons
[18:50:20] <imsky> haaha
[18:50:23] <imsky> "here you go fucker"
[18:50:31] <seancurtis> heh
[18:50:52] <GoGoGarrett> :[ sorry
[18:50:58] <GoGoGarrett> didn't mean to give the wrong idea.
[18:51:03] <seancurtis> GoGoGarrett: can't guarantee how performant it is :)
[18:51:12] <seancurtis> just pulling your leg mate - it's all good :)
[18:52:11] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks a lot :]
[18:55:41] <jartron> a hoy hoy
[18:56:58] <jartron> anyone in here?
[18:57:28] <seancurtis> maayyyyyyyyyyybe
[18:57:53] <jartron> anyone want to help me figure out some .append goings on?
[18:58:33] <seancurtis> just ask the question in the channel jartron and available people will answer :)
[18:59:14] <jartron> I'm trying to append a bunch of social media link garbage after the page has finished loading
[18:59:45] <jartron> they're generated with php and there is more than one group per page
[19:00:51] <seancurtis> using jquery to append them?
[19:01:00] <min|dvir|us> Where is .clean called?
[19:01:01] <min|dvir|us> Furthermore, what does it do?
[19:01:10] <seancurtis> can't you just generate it using php jartron?
[19:01:40] <jartron> yeah but I want to append the stuff after the page is ready as it triples the load time
[19:01:56] <seancurtis> min|dvir|us: that's the second time you've asked that question since I've been in here and I have NFI what context you're talking about?
[19:02:16] <min|dvir|us> seancurtis, in that case, don't worry about it.
[19:02:49] <seancurtis> min|dvir|us: well either give some context so people can answer you or stop spamming the question :)
[19:03:20] <min|dvir|us> seancurtis, it's a pretty cut-and-dry question. jQuery has a function called clean.
[19:03:40] <min|dvir|us> I am asking about it because it's processor-intensive, as Firebug shows in the profiler.
[19:04:02] <min|dvir|us> There is no reason that information would help you answer the question.
[19:04:11] <seancurtis> min|dvir|us: I just searched api.jquery.com for .clean and couldn't find a reference to it...
[19:04:14] <seancurtis> ?clean
[19:04:15] <bot-t> seancurtis, clean | jQuery Plugins - Allows you to validate the introduction into a text box data in a time format (HH: MM) which only lets you enter a time in correct format. Example: 23:15 1:15, Would not let you enter for example: ... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/clean
[19:04:22] <jartron> I asked the same question on stack exhange awhile back - there is an example of the code there too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6861878/delay-loading-for-specific-elements-with-jquery
[19:05:21] <min|dvir|us> I have no textboxes.
[19:05:24] <min|dvir|us> Nothing needs validation.
[19:05:33] <min|dvir|us> I never call .clean.
[19:05:49] <min|dvir|us> Plus that's a plugin.
[19:06:00] <seancurtis> min|dvir|us: which plugin is it in?
[19:06:05] <min|dvir|us> It's in core.
[19:06:19] <detain> if i have a bunch of buttonsets ... can i set them all up at once w/ like    $(".stats_buttonset").buttonset();      or do i have to do each set of them w/ individual calls?
[19:06:20] <seancurtis> jartron: you have some php stuff in that js - is the JS inline on the php page or in an external file?
[19:06:33] <jartron> seancurtis: inline
[19:07:15] <seancurtis> jartron: and what's the problem?
[19:07:34] <seancurtis> do you have an element on the page matching the ul selector?
[19:08:00] <jartron> seancurtis: I just can't get it working correctly. I guess it's a syntax issue.
[19:08:08] <jartron> yes
[19:08:33] <seancurtis> yeah not sure - got a live example page we can look at?
[19:08:53] <jartron> I'll put something together
[19:11:43] <jartron> http://geek.computron5000.com/
[19:12:13] <jartron> and the appending happens here: http://i.imgur.com/PY4IV.png
[19:14:17] <seancurtis> min|dvir|us: you can inspect the source code for jquery here: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.2.js looks like clean() is called within the buildFragment method
[19:14:30] <jartron> sorry theres so much other stuff going on on that page. If you want I can make a cleaner example.
[19:17:10] <seancurtis> it's ok
[19:17:26] <seancurtis> the script tag inside the appended content is screwing up the append
[19:17:32] <seancurtis> it's a pretty dirty way of doing it
[19:17:42] <seancurtis> explain to me again why you can't just put it in the page?
[19:19:46] <jartron> because all those requests increase the load time like crazy. This way the content loads first. What would be a cleaner way to do it?
[19:20:26] <seancurtis> well you could try adding the defer attribute to the script tags
[19:20:47] <seancurtis> the requests happen anyway - adding defer means at least it'll not block the page
[19:21:18] <seancurtis> can't really do it for the ifram
[19:21:19] <seancurtis> iframe
[19:21:46] <seancurtis> so just have php write out the ul and li's but then add "defer" to the inside of those script tags
[19:22:02] <seancurtis> <script defer>...</script>
[19:22:14] <seancurtis> you don't need type="text/javascript" btw
[19:22:16] <Matt470> hello
[19:22:38] <jartron> alright, defer is new to me. I'll read up on it.
[19:23:09] <Matt470> if someone would be so kind to help, I'm trying to create a countdown clock
[19:23:35] <jartron> http://i.imgur.com/gEvgs.png - Only supported by IE?
[19:23:41] <seancurtis> jartron: check out some of the perf posts by Steve Souders and Paul Irish :)
[19:24:13] <Matt470> I'm having trouble splitting up the hours to minutes and seconds
[19:25:56] <seancurtis> jartron: sorry - should be async not defer
[19:25:59] <min|dvir|us> Matt470, what do you have?
[19:26:03] <seancurtis> and don't use w3schools - they're shite
[19:26:06] <min|dvir|us> An integer number of hours?
[19:26:18] <Matt470> yeah
[19:26:20] <min|dvir|us> jartron, http://w3fools.com
[19:26:29] <jartron> haha
[19:26:38] <min|dvir|us> jartron, that's not a joke. Go there.
[19:26:45] <min|dvir|us> Matt470, what makes you think that there are seconds when you have a whole number of hours?
[19:27:35] <jartron> I am henceforth converted.
[19:27:54] <Matt470> ?, I want to show 59 seconds then when it reaches 0 it'll -1 minutes and when 60 minutes are up -1 hour
[19:27:56] <bot-t> Matt470, Couldn't find ", I want to show 59 seconds then when it reaches 0 it'll -1 minutes and when 60 minutes are up -1 hour" in jQuery Docs.
[19:28:16] <seancurtis> jartron: http://davidwalsh.name/html5-async
[19:28:23] <Matt470>  I want to show 59 seconds then when it reaches 0 it'll -1 minutes and when 60 minutes are up -1 hour
[19:28:29] <Matt470> and so forth
[19:28:31] <min|dvir|us> I understand this.
[19:28:35] <min|dvir|us> Matt470, you are not communicating with me what information you have.
[19:28:47] <min|dvir|us> You have the current time.
[19:28:51] <min|dvir|us> (That is a given.)
[19:28:59] <Matt470> yes
[19:29:02] <min|dvir|us> Do you have the time to which to countdown?
[19:29:11] <Matt470> date, yes
[19:29:11] <min|dvir|us> Or do you have the length of time between now and the end?
[19:29:22] <Matt470> yep
[19:29:29] <min|dvir|us> Which one?
[19:29:43] <Matt470> all
[19:30:09] <Matt470> var for date to go to, var for curtime and var for difference
[19:30:14] <min|dvir|us> Excellent.
[19:30:22] <min|dvir|us> What units does the difference have?
[19:30:35] <Matt470> seconds
[19:30:44] <min|dvir|us> So it is an integer number of seconds.
[19:30:58] <Matt470> yes
[19:31:14] <min|dvir|us> To be clear: you have the number of seconds between curtime and 'date to go to', yes?
[19:31:25] <Matt470> yes
[19:31:32] <min|dvir|us> It would have been wise to say that at first.
[19:31:41] <Matt470> I multiplied it by (60*60), oh sorry
[19:32:23] <min|dvir|us> Matt470, it's fine. You should try to give as much important information as you can to the people that are helping (but only important information so as to not cloud their minds).
[19:32:35] <min|dvir|us> In any case, if you're stupid, you can do what you're trying to do.
[19:32:41] <min|dvir|us> But you're not.
[19:32:46] <min|dvir|us> So we're going to do it a different way.
[19:32:55] <ArtzStudio> <span id="countdown">October 15, 2011 9:00</span>
[19:32:56] <ArtzStudio> <script>
[19:32:56] <ArtzStudio> (function(){
[19:32:56] <ArtzStudio> var targetElem = document.getElementById("countdown"),
[19:32:57] <ArtzStudio> 	targetDate = new Date(targetElem.innerHTML);
[19:32:57] <ArtzStudio> function countdown() {
[19:32:57] <ArtzStudio> 	targetElem.innerHTML = Math.abs( Math.floor( ( new Date().getTime() - targetDate ) / (1000 * 60 * 60) )) + " Hours Remain!";
[19:32:58] <ArtzStudio> 	setTimeout(countdown, 10000);
[19:32:58] <ArtzStudio> }
[19:32:58] <ArtzStudio> countdown();
[19:32:58] <ArtzStudio> })();
[19:32:59] <ArtzStudio> </script>
[19:33:09] <kborchers> ArtzStudio: don't do that!
[19:33:09] <min|dvir|us> Don't paste in the channel.
[19:33:11] <ArtzStudio> sorry
[19:33:20] <min|dvir|us> ArtzStudio, http://paste.pocoo.org
[19:33:37] <ArtzStudio> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/463401/
[19:33:56] <min|dvir|us> Matt470, what you want to do is to use a greedy algorithm.
[19:34:21] <min|dvir|us> You're going to convert this integer number of seconds to seconds, minutes, hours, and possibly days.
[19:34:25] <min|dvir|us> Possibly years.
[19:34:40] <min|dvir|us> And every second, you're going to use this function on this integer.
[19:34:54] <min|dvir|us> This way, you're not storing seconds, minutes, hours, and days.
[19:34:58] <min|dvir|us> You're computing them every time.
[19:35:05] <min|dvir|us> Makes sense?
[19:35:17] <Matt470> oh ok, yeah
[19:37:16] <Matt470> I can do this, thanks
[19:37:31] <min|dvir|us> Matt470, function getHoursMinutesSeconds(differenceSeconds) { hours = differenceSeconds / 3600; minutes = (differenceSeconds / 60) % 60; seconds = differenceSeconds % 3600; return [hours, minutes, seconds] }.
[19:37:50] <min|dvir|us> Whoops.
[19:37:55] <min|dvir|us> Matt470, function getHoursMinutesSeconds(differenceSeconds) { hours = differenceSeconds / 3600; minutes = (differenceSeconds / 60) % 60; seconds = differenceSeconds % 60; return [hours, minutes, seconds] }.
[19:39:31] <min|dvir|us> Of course, you can continue further with days and years. All you need to know is how many seconds go in a year.
[19:44:40] <jartron> Me again. Async works beautifully for except for in this case: http://i.imgur.com/YoYxh.png  Any ideas on how I could make it happen?
[19:48:53] <ArtzStudio> jartron: does this have to work in IE
[19:48:58] <jartron> nope.
[19:49:18] <ArtzStudio> i don't think inline scripts can be marked 'async'
[19:49:28] <ArtzStudio> is it getting executed before the external script
[19:49:29] <ArtzStudio> ?
[19:51:08] <ArtzStudio> guess i should ask, define not "working"
[19:51:30] <jartron> the reddit button isn't being displayed.
[19:52:29] <jartron> artzstudio: and yes, async seems to be working on a few other social media inline scripts
[19:52:53] <ArtzStudio> i've never async'ed the reddit button
[19:53:03] <ArtzStudio> on their page http://www.reddit.com/buttons/
[19:53:19] <ArtzStudio> looks like inline script is before external .. shouldnt make a diff tho
[19:53:59] <jartron> yeah I switched them to see if it affected anything
[19:54:16] <ArtzStudio> ah.  and it works without 'async' ?
[19:54:24] <jartron> yeah
[19:54:27] <ArtzStudio> have u tried <script defer instead
[19:54:47] <ArtzStudio> should have same effect, i.e. not block render
[19:54:51] * coldhead np: sonic youth - star power
[19:56:58] <jartron> dosen't seem to work in defer either
[19:57:05] <jartron> *with defer
[19:57:38] <jartron> I guess I could host the script locally with the parameters?
[19:59:46] <ArtzStudio> the reddit script locally?
[20:00:00] <ArtzStudio> probably not ideal if they update it, etc
[20:00:33] <ArtzStudio> ah i see why
[20:00:38] <ArtzStudio> they are guilty of using document.write
[20:00:40] <ArtzStudio> http://www.reddit.com/static/button/button3.js
[20:00:46] <ArtzStudio> you can't async scripts w/ document.write
[20:01:11] <ArtzStudio> they must be publicly shunned.
[20:01:32] <jartron> that widget is such a POS
[20:01:35] <ArtzStudio> you might be able to rewrite their cript
[20:01:45] <ArtzStudio> all its doing is appending params to an iframe
[20:03:12] <ArtzStudio> i'll rewrite it maybe tomorrow if u can wait :)
[20:03:15] <jartron> thats a fine idea artzstudio
[20:03:40] <ArtzStudio> make a little jQuery plugin out of it
[20:03:48] <jartron> I'll give you like $20 about it
[20:03:54] <ArtzStudio> $(.mydiv).reddit();
[20:04:36] <jartron> All I'm trying to do is make it load last
[20:04:49] <ArtzStudio> yerp
[20:04:59] <ArtzStudio> can't do anything with that document.write there
[20:05:05] <jartron> A few of those widgets on a page slows it down like crazy
[20:06:30] <ArtzStudio> yep, same with like button, google +, etc.
[20:06:38] <ArtzStudio> i have jquery plugins that speed them up significantly
[20:06:42] <ArtzStudio> loading them on demand, etc
[20:07:23] <jartron> yeah. I origianlly came here looking for a way to .append a list of social widgets after the page is ready...but that got messy with all of the <scripts> inside
[20:07:54] <jartron> ideally the content would load - then the social stuff
[20:08:22] <ArtzStudio> yeah thats pretty ez with jquery
[20:08:32] <ArtzStudio> just snag all the placeholders and initialize them
[20:08:50] <ArtzStudio> email me dave@artzstudio.com and i will hook u up
[20:15:32] <echosystm> does jquery have any date/time functions?
[20:15:38] <echosystm> like say ISO 8061 parsing?
[20:15:39] <jartron> artzstudio: sent an email thanks a bunch for your help
[20:15:52] <ArtzStudio> cool
[20:16:23] <jartron> I'm out. Thanks everyone!
[20:19:36] <MagBo> greetings, gentlemen. I try to use jQuery.form plugin and it works perfectly for file uploads IFF the port isn't specified i.e. http://myhost.com
[20:19:51] <ArtzStudio> echo: does the Date() object not do the job
[20:20:06] <ArtzStudio> (not jquery)
[20:20:34] <MagBo> but once I type in port number like http://myhost.com:8080 it says Permission denied to get property Window.document
[20:20:44] <MagBo> ideas?
[20:21:04] <echosystm> ArtzStudio: nope
[20:21:17] <echosystm> ISO 8061 is only implemented in chrone, ff 4.0+, ie 9.0+
[20:21:43] <ArtzStudio> ah.  did u ask google
[20:21:55] <echosystm> i think im going to go back to dojo, i want to use jquery because its what everyone else uses, but it seems to have piss weak functionality
[20:22:08] <echosystm> yeah, google just gave me datejs etc.
[20:23:01] <coldhead> most people love piss weak functionality i guess :(
[20:23:04] <coldhead> poor fools
[20:25:56] <Twelve-60> MagBo: are you uploading to the same port as the form is on?
[20:26:40] <MagBo> well, form action is just `action="/upload"`
[20:26:52] <coldhead> we'll know where when we get there you said
[20:26:52] <MagBo> does that mean that the answer is `yes`?
[20:33:59] <MagBo> Twelve-60, lol, I reduced my problem a bit
[20:34:26] <MagBo> Twelve-60, the matter is that files can be uploaded to the first webserver I run on my machine only
[20:35:03] <MagBo> if I run myhost:8080 first  file uploads work for it
[20:35:13] <MagBo> but not for myhost:80
[20:35:21] <MagBo> and vice-versa :D (wtf)
[20:37:30] <ArtzStudio> echo - this work? http://marcgrabanski.com/articles/jquery-date-plugin
[20:37:53] <ArtzStudio> seems like a good plugin idea if it doesnt exist yet
[20:43:26] <ngharo> you could easily parse iso 8061 date by massaging the data a bit and passing it into a Date() object
[20:44:08] <coldhead> gross
[20:47:34] <ngharo> ;)
[20:48:26] <LeoJweda> Hi, so what DOES .ui-helper-clearfix do?
[20:51:39] <ngharo> echosystm: actually Date.parse() does parse iso 8061 ...
[20:51:45] <MagBo> it applies float wrapping properties to parent elements
[20:53:16] <ngharo> ?j var t = Date.parse('1993-01-23T22:26Z'); var d = new Date(t); d.toDateString();
[20:53:17] <snover> ngharo: not quite.
[20:53:18] <bot-t> ngharo, Couldn't find "j var t = Date.parse('1993-01-23T22:26Z'); var d = new Date(t); d.toDateString();" in jQuery Docs.
[20:53:27] <ngharo> ?js var t = Date.parse('1993-01-23T22:26Z'); var d = new Date(t); d.toDateString();
[20:53:28] <bot-t> ngharo: "Sun Jan 24 1993"
[20:55:26] <ngharo> i miss the 90s
[20:55:41] <LeoJweda> MagBo: Yes, I read that, but what does that mean?
[20:57:00] <MagBo> LeoJweda, what exactly isn't clear from that description?
[20:57:41] <LeoJweda> MagBo: To me, float wrapping is overflow:auto;
[20:57:58] <snover> LeoJweda: that is a rather bad way to do it.
[20:58:15] <LeoJweda> snover: really? I thought that was the best way :-/
[20:58:53] <snover> It can cause spontaneous scrollbars and, of course, you can’t adjust content outside to appear of the bounds of the containing box
[20:59:47] <LeoJweda> snover: So I should just apply .ui-helper-clearfix instead?
[21:02:23] <snover> if you are using jquery ui, and you need a clearfix
[21:02:56] <LeoJweda> snover: thanks :)
[21:04:17] <LeoJweda> sorry for the possibly-dumb questions but I'm looking for a "panel" widget which is pretty much a non-draggable dialog box used to divide content on the page. Is there a jqueryui widget gallery I can look for that in or should i just create it myself?
[21:04:53] <LeoJweda> Also, can I create it based on dialog (some kind of inheritance) or do i have to create the whole thing from scratch?
[21:06:44] <MagBo> o7
[21:07:11] <snover> LeoJweda: sounds like you are doing something kind of complex and app-ish?
[21:09:45] <LeoJweda> snover: no, not really… I'm thinking of using the panels to list objects (kinda like the main page of stack overflow, except I have a description too), I figured panels look nice and a quick mockup shows that they do indeed look great
[21:15:21] <snover> so you want a…um…div.
[21:16:04] <LeoJweda> snover: yes, that looks like a dialog :D *deja vu*
[21:16:25] <snover> what does a dialogue look like? a…box.
[21:18:11] <LeoJweda> snover: well, that's pretty much what i have now: 3 divs (a container, the header, and the content)
[21:18:31] <LeoJweda> snover: it's just that that feels generic enough for it to be its own diget
[21:18:38] <LeoJweda> s/diget/widget/
[21:20:16] <aaairc> is it bad to have an html attribute that has a lot of text... like 5 paragraphs of text?
[21:20:35] <snover> aaairc: it would tend to indicate you are doing something wrong. DOM is not your own personal storage site.
[21:20:41] <LeoJweda> aaairc: style?
[21:21:51] <aaairc> for example, if i had a page with 50 result objects... in my case they are local events... i could store the description of each event in a div attribute, and then when a specific event is clicked on, i don't do a page load or even an ajax call i just pull the description off the attribute (it more often than not would only be 1 paragraph... a couple sentences)
[21:22:44] <aaairc> the other option i see is to do an ajax call just for the description text each time an event is clicked on... but i figured if text isn't that big a deal to throw on as an attribute... i would just pull all the text at once on the initial page load
[21:23:30] <ngharo> there are plenty of other saner ways to store that data
[21:23:41] <ngharo> like hidden div, js array, etc
[21:23:57] <aaairc> what makes those ways saner?
[21:24:30] <ngharo> when you want to display the description, you place it in a div I would assume?
[21:24:32] <khmer> aaairc: DOM is not optimized to store that much data in an attribute
[21:24:41] <khmer> aaairc: i think ajax is the best way to do this
[21:24:48] <khmer> aaairc: lighter page, data on demand
[21:25:04] <danzik171> aairc:  That's a lot of extra data you're sending down, I wouldn't do it.  Do an ajax call, and if the data never changes, cache the results in an object on the response
[21:25:30] <LeoJweda> aaairc: sane = using things for their intended purpose… or close to it.
[21:26:24] <aaairc> LeoJweda: I would first have to know the intended purpose of html attributes... which i didn't... which is why i asked the question in the first place
[21:27:32] <LeoJweda> aaairc: set different properties of each tag, i.e., the source of an img tag, the colspan of a td, the width of a div, etc
[21:29:15] <danzik171> aairc:  Some data is fine to put in the DOM, hence the HTML5 data-* tags.  Just don't abuse it by storing novels in each tag, especially if that doesn't isn't necessarily needed all the time
[21:29:49] <danzik171> s/doesn't/data
[21:30:06] <aaairc> danzik171: so i am using that data-* tag... i'm just trying to find out at what point it would be considered abusing it
[21:30:46] <khmer> aaairc: attributes are descriptive
[21:30:53] <khmer> aaairc: not narrative
[21:31:05] <khmer> aaairc: your attributes should describe your content, not be your content
[21:31:13] <khmer> aaairc: semantic web lol nrghhnr
[21:31:32] <snover> heh khmer
[21:31:54] <khmer> sorry hairball
[21:32:11] <khmer> it's funny, i'm actually writing a domain-specific language using only html5 right now
[21:32:38] <khmer> i could serialize a data object right into one of the data- attributes if i want to
[21:32:39] * LeoJweda wonders how one can store content in an attribute while keeping one's html valid
[21:32:43] <danzik171> aaairc:  It sounds like this data would be better retrieved via ajax - if it never changes, stick it in localStorage
[21:35:04] <khmer> yeah localStorage is a good idea
[21:35:13] <aaairc> khmer: so in my Controller, on page load, i grab all the events out of the database for that page... and then i send those event objects, with all the related data over to my template engine, which then grabs the necessary information out of the event objects and builds out my event html divs that are then sent to the web browser... so right now, whether i like it or not, the way my web framework (or more specifically my persistence lay
[21:35:13] <aaairc> currently set up... all the event description text is pulled from the database and sent to the template engine within the web server. from this point it sounds like everyone is telling me not to pull the event description text within the template engine and add it as an html data- attribute. instead, do an ajax call (meaning to trips from database to template engine within the server, delivering the same information... still only one tr
[21:35:13] <aaairc> the browser with the data)
[21:35:29] <aaairc> danzik171: could you explain localStorage a little?
[21:35:35] <aaairc> or point me to a link
[21:35:46] <coldhead> ?g dive into html5 local storage
[21:35:47] <aaairc> not sure what that means/is... i'm still pretty new
[21:35:47] <bot-t> coldhead, Local Storage - Dive Into HTML5 - http://diveintohtml5.org/storage.html
[21:35:52] <coldhead> that guy ^^
[21:35:59] <aaairc> thnx
[21:37:58] <khmer> aaairc: if localStorage wouldn't be appropriate for this use case, due to event objects etc., then it sounds like you need a session provider
[21:38:42] <aaairc> khmer: to be clear... when i say event objects... i mean like 50 cent is playing at the astro dome... so like local band events
[21:38:54] <khmer> ohhhh.
[21:38:59] <khmer> so you're not doing evented i/o
[21:39:03] <coldhead> lol
[21:39:08] <khmer> also, 50 cent is playing at the astrodome?
[21:39:15] <coldhead> lol fiddy
[21:39:32] <khmer> the astros don't even play at the astrodome!
[21:40:59] <aaairc> lol
[21:43:27] <aaairc> so in this case since i meant like i have a page of data objects... in this case local music events... that have a title, description, artist bio... i could each put data-attributes on my local event divs on the outset with all the info... meaning i send more text over the wire to the browser... lets say 50 paragraphs of text... or i do an ajax call each time an event is clicked on grabbing each paragraph of text on demand
[21:48:04] <danzik171> aaairc: The question is, do you expect this data to be needed every single time you load this page, or is someone going to look at a single event and then leave
[21:49:14] <aaairc> danzik171: someone could look at a single event an leave... but if text isn't really that big of a deal in terms of size/sending it to the browser... i was thinking it may not be worth the added complexity to start doing ajax calls
[21:49:22] <aaairc> *and
[21:50:05] <aaairc> danzik171: i'm actually just learning how to do an ajax page load... this is all new to me... so i may also be exagerating that added complexity in my head
[21:51:23] <danzik171> aaairc: Just take some time and mess around with it then to understand it.  Make a test page with an empty <div>, and try to populate that div with the contents of www.google.com via ajax or something.
[21:52:27] <ndss56> if (message.length != 0 && message != " ") {} <-- does not fix problem if there are a bunch on white spaces.
[21:53:00] <SirCmpwn> doesn't jquery have a trim() function?
[21:53:11] <SirCmpwn> or a isNullOrWhitespace function?
[21:53:17] <ndss56> does it?
[21:53:36] <ndss56> where would trim() be under?
[21:53:37] <aaairc> danzik171: so your saying 50 paragraphs of text on a page load versus 2 is a big enough deal i should do ajax loading for it... that that will make a difference in speed, etc?
[21:53:39] <SirCmpwn> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[21:53:51] <ndss56> cheers SirCmpwn
[21:53:54] <SirCmpwn> that will remove leading and trailing whitespace.  In a string of only whitespace, the result is ""
[21:53:57] <SirCmpwn> have fun
[21:56:49] <danzik171> aaairc: Possibly speed a bit.  Either way will accomplish what you want to do, but imho the "right" way to do this is via an ajax call and then caching the results.
[21:57:03] <danzik171> aaairc: It's up to you to pursue it or not.
[21:57:31] <ndss56> danzik171: how you cache the results?
[21:57:36] <aaairc> danzik171: anything you could point me towards in terms of caching the results? how that works...
[21:57:42] <aaairc> same question
[21:59:39] <devdrinker> on a Mac OS X 10.5 host using Virutlabox 4.x, with an Linux guest (X gui), operating in full screen mode (with relevant vboxvideo vboxsf etc..)  when I move the mouse to the top of screen the mac os x toolbar drops down, how can I prevent this?
[21:59:43] <devdrinker> sorry wrong window
[21:59:58] <sonuloveu> lol
[22:00:03] <sonuloveu> lack of sleep?#
[22:00:33] <danzik171> aaairc: This might be a bit much, but something like http://jsfiddle.net/uRWNu/
[22:01:21] <danzik171> Or you can replace that cache object with localStorage like I suggested earlier.
[22:02:28] <aaairc> danzik171: so when you say pull the descriptive text wtih ajax and then cache it... you are just caching it for the time the user is on the page... when he does a new page load, the cache would be cleared?
[22:02:52] <danzik171> aairc: Correct.  Unless you use localStorage which is not cleared
[22:03:07] <aaairc> danzik171: okay that makes sense to me
[22:03:11] <aaairc> thx
[22:03:58] <ndss56> danzik171: not familar with the syntax var cache = {};
[22:04:25] <ndss56> is that javascript array?
[22:04:29] <danzik171> ndss56: It's just an object, nothing special
[22:04:33] <aaairc> its just any variable... in this case a map object
[22:05:35] <ndss56> so caching is just storing the data in a variable.
[22:06:07] <coldhead> ?eval var cache = {}; cache.some_property = 'now assignable';
[22:06:08] <bot-t> coldhead: "now assignable"
[22:06:26] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[22:06:26] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[22:06:35] <coldhead> sure you are, botsy
[22:06:54] <aaairc> lol
[22:07:18] <ndss56> how you assign a method to the object cache = {}
[22:07:40] <aaairc> thats just javascript i think
[22:07:42] <aaairc> not some special method
[22:08:02] <aaairc> like a way to define a key value pair
[22:08:13] <aaairc> so a way to specify a map key
[22:08:15] <ndss56> danzik171: why didn't you do cache.id = data? instead of cache[id] = data?
[22:08:55] <gf3> those are not equivalent
[22:08:59] <danzik171> ndss56: Because then you'd be setting the property "id" and it would get clobbered every time you made a request
[22:09:36] <gf3> ?eval var id = "pee", cache = {}; cache.id = "poo
[22:09:37] <bot-t> gf3: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
[22:09:41] <gf3> ?eval var id = "pee", cache = {}; cache.id = "poo"; cache
[22:09:42] <bot-t> gf3: {"id": "poo"}
[22:09:45] <danzik171> ndss56: Or actually, you would have one successful request - all subsequent ones would return cache.id (whatever the first request was, regardless)
[22:09:49] <gf3> ?eval var id = "pee", cache = {}; cache[id] = "poo"; cache
[22:09:50] <bot-t> gf3: {"pee": "poo"}
[22:10:23] <gf3> consider those two lines of code, ndss56 ↑
[22:10:32] <ndss56> examining now
[22:13:33] <ndss56> dont get it
[22:13:52] <ndss56> i must be dumb
[22:14:24] <gf3> ndss56: {"id": "poo"} vs {"pee": "poo"}
[22:17:00] <ndss56> i get it but why can't you do cache.id = data? instead of cache[id] = data?
[22:17:23] <gf3> for the very reason I have just shown you
[22:17:35] <gf3> they yield two totally different results
[22:17:35] <ndss56> ok i think i get it
[22:18:17] <ndss56> gf3: how to define a method for object cache
[22:18:32] <gf3> ndss56: same as any other value
[22:19:02] <ndss56> gf3: you mean like this var cache  = function () {}
[22:19:32] <gf3> ?eval var cache = { amount: 7 }; cache.dicks = function(){ return this.amount + " ROFLz" }; cache.dicks()
[22:19:32] <bot-t> gf3: "7 ROFLz"
[22:19:37] <gf3> ndss56 ↑
[22:20:16] <ndss56> gf3: well done
[22:21:31] <ndss56> ? eval var cache.amount = 7; cache.dicks = function(){ return this.amount; };
[22:21:32] <bot-t> ndss56: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[22:21:37] <ndss56> ?eval var cache.amount = 7; cache.dicks = function(){ return this.amount; };
[22:21:38] <bot-t> ndss56: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[22:21:57] <danheberden> i am really diggin' y'alls creative object's
[22:21:58] <gf3> ndss56: you haven't defined cache anywhere
[22:22:09] <ndss56> u didnt either before
[22:22:20] <danheberden> "var cache ="
[22:22:25] <danheberden> MIGHT be declaring a var
[22:22:46] <ndss56> ?eval var cache = {}; cache.amount = 7; cache.dicks = function(){ return this.amount; };
[22:22:47] <bot-t> ndss56: <function () {return this.amount;}>
[22:23:36] <ndss56> thats werid
[22:23:37] <gf3> ndss56: good, now don't forget to call your function to see the result
[22:24:03] <ndss56> ?eval var cache = {}; cache.amount = 7; cache.dicks = function(){ return this.amount; }; cace.dicks();
[22:24:04] <bot-t> ndss56: ReferenceError: cace is not defined
[22:24:07] <aaairc> khmer: in terms of returning just the descriptive text data i need using the ajax requestion... should i send it in a json or xml format from the server, in then parse it using jquery?
[22:24:10] <ndss56> ?eval var cache = {}; cache.amount = 7; cache.dicks = function(){ return this.amount; }; cache.dicks();
[22:24:11] <bot-t> ndss56: 7
[22:24:15] <ndss56> :D
[22:24:39] <ndss56> gf3: you are a good teacher.
[22:24:43] <Cork> ?eval var cache = {}; cache.amount = 7; cache.__defineGetter__('dicks', function(){ return this.amount; }); cache.dicks
[22:24:43] <bot-t> Cork: 7
[22:25:53] <ndss56> Cork: don't see the point in wrapping dicks()
[22:26:02] <Cork> its not a wrapper
[22:26:14] <danheberden> wrapping dicks is the shit
[22:26:25] <Cork> ?eval var cache = {}; cache.amount = 7; cache.__defineSetter__('dicks', function(val){ this.amount = val; }); cache.dicks = 8; cache.amount
[22:26:26] <bot-t> Cork: 8
[22:27:23] <coldhead> that would never work in real life
[22:27:28] <Cork> ol
[22:27:44] <coldhead> la
[22:27:56] <Cork> xd
[22:28:17] <danheberden> why not jsut reduce the object to a func?
[22:28:18] <Cork> i should prob reboot this comp to fix this annoying focus problem
[22:28:40] <danheberden> ?eval var cache = function wat() { return wat.amount; }; cache.amount = 7; cache();
[22:28:40] <bot-t> danheberden: 7
[22:28:53] <danheberden> GIN CODING
[22:28:59] <gf3> ?eval var cache = { amount: 7, get dicks(){ return this.amount }, set dicks(n){ this.amount = n } }; cache.dicks = 9; cache.dicks
[22:29:00] <bot-t> gf3: 9
[22:29:26] <danheberden> those are some hot getters and setters there gf3
[22:29:33] <ndss56> gf3: thats the way it should be done :)
[22:29:43] <danheberden> ndss56 ITS A TRAP
[22:29:43] <gf3> danheberden: I quite like your function solution
[22:29:58] <danheberden> gf3 i had a framework like that that pulled apart the obj keys
[22:30:02] <ndss56> why is it a trap
[22:30:10] <danheberden> so , like, cache( 'wat.omg' ); would get the wat.omg inside
[22:30:17] <danheberden> felt snazzy
[22:30:28] <danheberden> and could reduce to a failsafe in templates 'n shit if wat.omg wasn't defined
[22:30:29] <Haprog> oh, I didn't even know you could have getters and setters defined like that in js. good to know.
[22:30:33] <gf3> danheberden: noice!
[22:30:40] <danheberden> ndss56 i'm just kidding mate
[22:30:50] <gf3> danheberden: I started writing an ORM that used pretty getters/setters that mapped to methods
[22:30:57] <danheberden> gf3 is a fucking genius, so take whatever he says as biblical goodness
[22:31:13] <coldhead> Haprog: check for browser support before trusting your life to it, k?
[22:31:17] <Haprog> ok
[22:31:30] <ndss56> im gf3 new apprentice
[22:31:32] <ndss56> lol
[22:31:33] <danheberden> would that allow hooks? like - mine had the ability to add pre and post hooks to the action side of the mvc
[22:31:54] <coldhead> someone is going to write a life support machine in JS
[22:31:56] <gf3> danheberden: yeah, I called them "filters"
[22:31:58] <coldhead> and then run it on IE6
[22:32:02] <gf3> danheberden: can you see this file? https://raw.github.com/gf3/Supermodel/master/example/object-store.js?login=gf3&token=f6d1540dcd17e08c61b3659fee50fba4
[22:32:14] <danheberden> aye
[22:32:40] <danheberden> is that it, supermodel?
[22:32:50] <gf3> it might not make any sense without context, but yeah
[22:32:52] <danheberden> and should your token be public?
[22:32:54] <gf3> example usage
[22:33:03] <gf3> no idea
[22:33:19] <danheberden> ah, guess it's not your api key so should be coo
[22:33:44] <gf3> danheberden: basically you just set up your get/set methods, and all you do is return a value
[22:33:54] <gf3> and everything else is taken care of
[22:34:09] <danheberden> gf3 me likey
[22:34:18] <gf3> when you use an instance, it will map the props (via getters/setters) to your methods
[22:35:10] <coldhead> lol supermodel
[22:38:01] <ndss56>  return $.when ( cache[id] ) <-- what does this mean?
[22:38:50] <coldhead> ?when @ ndss56
[22:38:51] <bot-t> ndss56, jQuery.when() - Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[22:38:51] <ndss56> and why can't it be written as return if ( cache[id])
[22:39:02] <coldhead> it's deferred
[22:40:02] <danheberden> $.when( mayReturnNowOrLater )
[22:40:39] <coldhead> i don't get deferred either
[22:40:43] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[22:41:11] <gf3> welcome, coldhead
[22:41:27] <ndss56> i don't get deferred
[22:41:45] <ndss56> doc assumes you know what deferred means.
[22:42:17] <gf3> deferred == put off to a later time
[22:42:41] <ndss56> gf3: what sort of objects or ajax calls would respond later in time?
[22:44:49] <gf3> ndss56: anything asynchronous
[22:45:32] <ndss56> gf3: odd ive seen many ajax examples that don't use $.when()
[22:46:30] <gf3> ndss56: that's because $.when is the new hawtness
[22:46:54] <ndss56> what does hawtness mean?
[22:47:00] <manuel_> it's the shizzle though, a pleasure to use
[22:47:40] <ndss56> when was it introduced into jQuery?
[22:47:59] <ndss56> 1.5
[22:48:24] <ndss56> why was there a need for $.when()?
[22:49:16] <ndss56> ahh i see, its more for when you have two or more deferred objects.
[22:49:34] <ndss56> not sure you would use it if you had one object..

[22:53:33] <danheberden> WAT
[22:54:30] <ndss56> danheberden: are you the maker of jquery?

[22:56:04] <ndss56> awesome
[22:57:42] <ndss56> danheberden: why does your website need an API?
[22:58:41] <danheberden> wat
[22:59:37] <ndss56> API
[22:59:37] <ndss56> Coming soon! Keep an eye on the Lanyrd blog.
[23:01:57] <danheberden> ndss56 that's not my site - the vid is on vimeo and that's just what google found first
[23:02:03] <CodeZombie> this crap makes me never want to use tables again
[23:02:40] <ndss56> danheberden: ok
[23:06:32] <mercury_> i know that this is jquery but i have question if someone knows anythink about CKEDITOR ?
[23:08:06] <ndss56> never heard of it. what is it?
[23:08:26] <mercury_> wysiwyg editor
[23:08:58] <mercury_> awesome editor btw :)
[23:09:45] <CodeZombie> been working on this solution for a while... Right now, I'm using just plain http requests (no ajax) to re-arrange the order. However, it was brought to my attention that a client side solution might be more appealing... The issue is dealing w/ the nested table data here... I can't figure out a way with jquery to determine which items should be nested, and thus not re-ordered.... Suggestions welcome.
[23:09:49] <CodeZombie> http://misc.dev.codezombie.org/stuff/tables.html
[23:10:10] <CodeZombie> this is just demo code btw... heh, in case it wasn't obvious
[23:11:23] <CodeZombie> to see the exact issue, you just click down, next to the "parent" item... You'll see it moves down, where it shouldn't.
