[00:00:05] <krazyj> coldhead: those variables are accumulating/incrementing correctly
[00:00:22] <krazyj> Whirl3d: i decided to just keep the button, it's not being removed anymore
[00:00:27] <Whirl3d> coldhead, its the same advice you are giving  him
[00:00:27] <krazyj> this is a different problem
[00:00:34] <krazyj> lol no it's not!
[00:00:39] <krazyj> totally different problem :D
[00:00:45] <Whirl3d> but it's the same issue
[00:00:49] <krazyj> no. wrong.
[00:00:55] <Whirl3d> you need  to delegate your event handlers
[00:00:58] <krazyj> that issue was about a .click() binding
[00:01:03] <krazyj> this is about a totally different binding
[00:01:12] <Whirl3d> your code is a mess. It could be simply handled by one delegated event handler
[00:01:19] <Whirl3d> just like your click code
[00:01:26] <coldhead> krazyj: i would rewrite this code and have ONE function that is smart enough to work out the magic numbers and IDs it needs, rather than generating the code on the fly and appending it to individual elements
[00:01:36] <coldhead> Whirl3d style
[00:01:39] <Whirl3d> and for someone new here, you sure got all the answers, doncha
[00:02:01] <coldhead> aw don't be like that, Whirl3d
[00:02:44] <coldhead> krazyj: do you know what we mean about doing it in a single function?
[00:02:55] <krazyj> still working it out
[00:03:32] <Whirl3d> funny, my trigger elements are when someone says, WRONG. I can't stand that. I never say someone is wrong, just that there are other, possibly better, ways to do it. But to tell a total stranger that is trying to help that he/she is wrong. wow that pisses me of.
[00:03:36] <Whirl3d> *off
[00:03:49] <ifoundwaldo> I am using the jQuery UI. 	$('#content').tabs(); with a div #content holding a navigation<ul> with <li>'s and below that <div>'s for each tab from the <li> . for some reason when the page loads it starts on the last <li> Not the first one.
[00:04:13] <ifoundwaldo> can't seem to find any reason for this
[00:04:27] <coldhead> its not worth getting pissed about, Whirl3d
[00:04:27] <Whirl3d> but coldhead, thanks for the advice--sorry to be confrontational
[00:04:37] <coldhead> there is an unlimited supply of rude and stupid people
[00:04:38] <ifoundwaldo> and the select method isn't working
[00:04:42] <coldhead> you gotta roll with it
[00:04:49] * krazyj is rude and new
[00:04:50] <krazyj> sorry
[00:04:50] <Whirl3d> Yeah, other stressors. I learn from you every day.
[00:05:17] <coldhead> we're cool, krazyj
[00:05:22] <Whirl3d> krazyj, it's all good.
[00:05:31] <coldhead> no one is going to have their arms hacked off tonight
[00:05:45] <coldhead> at worst, someone will file their nails
[00:06:03] * Whirl3d is filing my nails as I type
[00:06:15] <coldhead> also bill murray is on twitter http://twitter.com/#!/billl_murry/status/196057815368994817
[00:06:16] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from billl_murry: I've been chatting with a 13 year old girl online. Then I found out she is a undercover cop. How cool is that for someone her age. ★ http://bit.ly/JEwrwp
[00:07:55] <ifoundwaldo> Any idas?
[00:08:05] <Whirl3d> ifoundwaldo, sorry, I'm reading back to see your problem.
[00:08:14] <ifoundwaldo> thank you.
[00:08:44] <TylerWhitney> is there something wrong with getting a value of a radio button like this? $('input:radio[name=cpreference]:checked').val()
[00:08:50] <Whirl3d> ifoundwaldo, this is a great opprotunity for jsfiddle
[00:08:51] <iateadonut> d1 = [[0,117],[1,132],[2,142],[3,132],[4,139],[5,156],[6,92]];
[00:08:51] <iateadonut> $.plot($("#placeholder"), [ d1 ]);
[00:09:03] <iateadonut> that works.  with directly writing the javascript that way.
[00:09:29] <iateadonut> but if i get that same string from ajax, i can't seem to get that same function to work.
[00:09:31] <Cork> TylerWhitney: $('input[name=cpreference]:radio:checked')
[00:09:36] <Whirl3d> if you aren't familiar with it, just check it out. It's a great sandbox for issues like this. Paste your code in a "fiddle" and share the link back here.
[00:09:41] <Cork> TylerWhitney: sub selectors should always be last
[00:09:44] <krazyj> coldhead: so, in essence, the suggestion was to switch to .on instead of .bind?
[00:09:46] <ifoundwaldo> okay.
[00:09:51] <Cork> *psudo-selectors
[00:09:51] <coldhead> yes, krazyj
[00:09:54] <TylerWhitney> ahh
[00:09:57] <krazyj> coldhead: check and still no dice :(
[00:09:58] <ifoundwaldo> let me check it out
[00:09:58] <coldhead> a single on() that will work everywhere
[00:10:07] <TylerWhitney> Cork: thanks... I think its that messing up my .ajax request
[00:10:12] <coldhead> i'm not saying replace your bind() with on(), krazyj
[00:10:23] <coldhead> i'm saying redo the code so it calls on() only once
[00:10:41] <coldhead> and the handler you provide to on is smart enough to work out which elements it needs to work with
[00:11:53] <krazyj> coldhead: so much design is such… + Add Item submit button… you click it. it adds two uniquely ID'd fields (ID name generated on the fly)… one is an input, one is a label, then binds the two together on 'keyup'…. how could all of this be one method?
[00:12:05] <iateadonut> all i'm doing is taking an array, json_encode ing in php then sending it back.
[00:12:44] <Whirl3d> krazyj, imagine one method listening for all those clicks, and keys. It would know what to ad d and ehere to add it.
[00:12:45] <NodeX> make sure they are coming back as Integers not strings
[00:13:18] <Whirl3d> and it wouldn't ever duplicated because you got one function handling it all. Add as many elements as you want and the same function works it out for you
[00:13:24] <krazyj> ah… i just don't understand that design pattern, i guess
[00:13:39] <coldhead> krazyj: i'll do you a teensy demo of the principle
[00:14:06] <ghjk> TylerWhitney, Cork: is the :radio pseudo-selector defined in the CSS spec?
[00:14:15] <ghjk> I never heard of it
[00:14:40] <Whirl3d> a simpler case is this:   you have five navigation buttons. Each button can handle it's own linking/hovering/etc. or you could have one function that listened to all the button's events and handled it. Then if you hadded 50 navgation buttons, that same code would still be able to handle all 50 new buttons.
[00:15:44] <Whirl3d> so in your code, you setup the top-most element to handle all the necessary adding, moving, math, etc. And then it doesn't matter how many children it has, it can still handle it.
[00:15:51] <admin0> hi .. is it possible to group vegetables into multiple checkboxes and onclick select via something .. like vitamin A, some begs ..check vitaminB, some another vegs ,  vitamin C and some from A some from B
[00:16:07] <krazyj> Whirl3d: hmmm ok
[00:16:18] <admin0> i don't need validation, just group based checkboxes ..  but one member can be a part of multiple group
[00:16:29] <Whirl3d> coldhead is working out a demo for ya. It'll make a lot more sense when you see it.
[00:16:35] <ravenzz> are method/variables/others in a isolated environment when they are wrapped in a (function(){ })();
[00:16:36] <ravenzz> ?
[00:17:03] <Whirl3d> ravenzz, it's called a closure, and yes.
[00:17:10] <ravenzz> yep
[00:17:18] <ravenzz> maccheroni english
[00:17:41] <Whirl3d> ?
[00:18:21] <Whirl3d> admin0 yes
[00:18:23] <ravenzz> nvm I forgot about the word 'closure'
[00:18:46] <iateadonut> had nothing to do with the JSON at all!
[00:18:48] <Whirl3d> admn0, the way you would handle it is that you would assign multiple classes to your elements and select that way.
[00:19:39] <admin0> i have 10 vegetables ..  and say 5 vitamins ..   A B C D E  .. .. among the 10, each can be a part of diff vitamin group ..
[00:19:49] <admin0> Whirl3d: so I need to give id to each checkbox and toggle it from somewhere ?
[00:19:52] <Whirl3d> For example, an apple might have the vita, and vitb class added to it. When the button labeled "vitamin a" was clicked, you would find all of the element in the .vita class and click them
[00:20:03] <admin0> oh oh
[00:20:24] <Whirl3d> so if vitamin G was in all of them, they all get selected.
[00:20:32] <Whirl3d> when the g button is pushed
[00:20:37] <iateadonut> class="A B"
[00:21:44] <iateadonut> .bind( 'onclick', function() {  vitamin=$('#vitaminThing').val();  $('.'+vitamin).toggle() }
[00:22:13] <huntedmitch> Nice
[00:22:37] <huntedmitch> .bind huh?
[00:23:11] <huntedmitch> .on maybe? :-)
[00:23:14] <TylerWhitney> in my .ajax request why would using the option - contentType: "multipart/form-data" and POST not show up in $_POST in PHP, but when I leave it default its fine
[00:23:17] <Whirl3d> admin0, you could just have all your veggies in <li> elements. Then, go through each vegetable and assign it's vitamin classes like <li class='vita vitb vitc'>Apple</li><li class='sugar spice nice'>girls<li> and then your could have a button that when clicked, looked up all ".vitc" elements and added a ""highlightRed" class or something.
[00:23:17] <iateadonut> yeah
[00:23:37] <iateadonut> i mean, i was just trying to show how to make vitamin A vegetables disapper is all.
[00:23:44] <admin0> let me try once ..
[00:23:53] <iateadonut> now that you mention it, 'onlick' should be 'click'
[00:24:26] <iateadonut> and if #vitaminThing is a select element, it should be $('#vitaminThing option:selected').val()
[00:24:54] <coldhead> krazyj: this demo doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/AYz7F/
[00:24:59] <coldhead> i'm not sure why
[00:25:05] <coldhead> but if it DID work it would show you what i mean
[00:25:18] <iateadonut> because we should all be in bed now.  that's why.
[00:25:56] <coldhead> i feel that
[00:26:01] <coldhead> i am presently watching the sun set
[00:26:27] <coldhead> Cork, Whirl3d: why the fuck is my $('p').on('click') not working
[00:26:56] <iateadonut> $('#p') maybe?
[00:27:23] <coldhead> i'm selecting <p>, not id="p"
[00:27:31] <iateadonut> $('#p').on('click', function() { alert 'ok'; });
[00:27:36] <krazyj> coldhead: thanks for the demo
[00:27:38] <coldhead> this is the worst first day of jQuery i have ever had
[00:27:50] <iateadonut> it's been the worst day since yesterday.
[00:27:54] <krazyj> i'm still confused how to fix this across binded inputs and labels :P
[00:28:08] <coldhead> ANYWAY krazyj the point is you should be able to find the sibling elements with $(this).closest('something')
[00:28:19] <coldhead> OR if they're not siblings you can use ?data
[00:28:20] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[00:28:32] <coldhead> to store some metadata to help the handler find the associated elements
[00:28:33] <iateadonut> where's your <p> in the jfiddle?
[00:28:43] <krazyj> ok, i can see… but i have everything with unique IDs already built tho :P
[00:28:50] <coldhead> iateadonut: var $input = $('<p class="athing">click here</p>');
[00:29:03] <iateadonut> ah
[00:30:33] <rootcoma> http://pastebin.com/EEPuUY8h Is there a cleaner way to express this. (feel free to tell me it's a dumb question)
[00:30:34] <iateadonut> because you have to repeat part of that function within the function add_a_thing()
[00:30:39] <iateadonut> coldhead
[00:31:03] <iateadonut> you have to repeat that $(p).on function within that function so that it binds to the element that was just created.
[00:31:22] <coldhead> no you don't, iateadonut
[00:31:27] <coldhead> that's the point of on()
[00:31:33] <coldhead> you can bind to stuff that doesn't exist yet
[00:31:48] <iateadonut> really?
[00:31:48] <iateadonut> wow
[00:31:50] <Cork> well its the point of delegated events, on its for all event bindings :)
[00:32:00] <coldhead> SO WHY THE FUCK DOESN'T IT WORK FOR ME CORK
[00:32:03] <coldhead> I TRIED MY HARDEST
[00:32:05] <coldhead> I AM GOING TO CRY
[00:32:08] <iateadonut> http://jsfiddle.net/qwz6a
[00:32:14] <rootcoma> let it out. Don't be ashamed
[00:32:15] <iateadonut> i know that's not what you want though.
[00:32:16] <Ghan> good morning
[00:32:19] * Cork pats coldhead's head *there there*
[00:32:22] <iateadonut> probably dont' even look at it.
[00:32:43] <krazyj> OK!. got a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/f245B/
[00:32:47] <krazyj> don't hate my terrible, shitty code
[00:32:54] <krazyj> click '+Add New Item' twice
[00:33:07] <coldhead> the fact that this somehow magically fixes it ONLY MAKES ME MORE UPSET, iateadonut
[00:33:08] <krazyj> start typing in the *first* 'Item Name:' field that was added
[00:33:13] <Ghan> how do i get the text in the div with the class description when the checkbox is checked. .prev('.description') doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/tKbnd/
[00:33:17] <krazyj> notice that it modifies the THIRD 'New Item' string, above
[00:33:36] <krazyj> however, hit it again, notice that the newest added field modifies the last 'New Item' string
[00:33:42] <iateadonut> glad i could be of service.
[00:33:56] <iateadonut> sometimes when i can't figure something out, i go take a long poop and it occurs to me thenn.
[00:33:58] <krazyj> coldhead: can you figure this out? :)
[00:34:07] <iateadonut> so those are my two pieces of advice.
[00:34:09] <iateadonut> good night!
[00:35:01] <Whirl3d> Admin0, here is a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Fwtpj/28/
[00:35:16] <krazyj> Whirl3d: trade you http://jsfiddle.net/f245B/
[00:36:15] <admin0> Whirl3d: Thank you
[00:36:25] <admin0> i will try to modify it by adding checkboxes
[00:37:17] <Whirl3d> coldhead, I had a different understanding of .on
[00:37:47] <coldhead> its because you are using globals, krazyj
[00:37:51] <krazyj> ?
[00:37:58] <coldhead> even if you bind on() with current = 3
[00:38:04] <coldhead> if current later becomes 30
[00:38:09] <coldhead> and you run the handler
[00:38:11] <coldhead> it sees 30
[00:38:12] <coldhead> and uses that
[00:38:13] <krazyj> d'oh
[00:38:22] <krazyj> so that's how javascript manages variables...
[00:38:26] <krazyj> and memory
[00:38:36] <Ricaz> Can anyone recommend a good paging plugin?
[00:38:38] <krazyj> how do i use the variables statically
[00:38:44] <Whirl3d> I never thought of on as being attached to non-existing items. I thought that you would use .on on the parent of the non-existing items.
[00:38:54] <Whirl3d> what you describe sounds like .live()
[00:39:12] <Whirl3d> (which I know is the bastard father/son of .on and bind and all that)
[00:39:35] <krazyj> coldhead: so what to do here?
[00:40:21] <coldhead> krazyj: i think your choices are either struggle vainly for hours to try to deglobalise those vars
[00:40:31] <coldhead> OR rewrite it cleanly from scratch
[00:40:35] <krazyj> wat.
[00:42:37] <krazyj> coldhead: i only use those global vars in this section of code, if this is something i can do quikly
[00:42:52] <krazyj> there's no way for me to stay 'make a copy of these variables'?
[00:43:38] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/f245B/1/
[00:43:43] <coldhead> thats what i tried to do there
[00:43:48] <coldhead> but i doubt it will work
[00:44:08] <coldhead> you're going to remain in this purgatory until you lose the globals all together
[00:44:17] <Ghan> anyone? how do i get the text in the div with the class description when the checkbox is checked. .prev('.description') doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/tKbnd/
[00:44:43] <Cork> Ghan: you mean the parent div?
[00:44:58] <Cork> or hows the structure?
[00:45:05] <krazyj> coldhead: didn't work :(
[00:45:07] <Ghan> stucture is in the fiddle
[00:45:24] <Cork> ah! missed the link
[00:45:29] <Ghan> :P
[00:45:47] <krazyj> coldhead: so what are some ways i could track my total number of elements - and use that data in element names - outside of using globals?
[00:46:04] <Cork> Ghan: $(this).closest('.input').prev().text()
[00:47:16] <Cork> Ghan: or if you might have element inbetween $(this).closest('.input').prevAll('.description').last().text()
[00:48:36] <krazyj> Cork: any ideas? my global variables are blocking me: http://jsfiddle.net/f245B/
[00:49:13] <Ghan> no luck Cork
[00:49:28] <krazyj> coldhead: ok… so i could get the previous value and use a method to extract the number and use that for my new value
[00:49:34] <krazyj> *previous element
[00:49:35] <Cork> Ghan: where are you selecting from?
[00:49:44] <Whirl3d> krazyj, here is a simple .on handler: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/AYz7F/3/
[00:49:44] <dsfsdf> .
[00:49:46] <krazyj> and use a method to extract current indices from the ID name of the previous element
[00:49:50] <dsfsdf> hi
[00:50:41] <Ghan> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/tKbnd/1/
[00:51:04] <Ghan> have a bunch of checkboxes
[00:51:07] <Whirl3d> the holder element listens for the click event,  if it's an "incrementButton" , it strips the number off the end of it's text and adds the number of other incrementButtons to the end of the new button's text. Adds the new button and handles it.
[00:51:12] <coldhead> krazyj: not that i'm terribly experienced in such matters but i get the feeling a clean rewrite without globals will be faster than trying to inflate this corpse
[00:51:26] <krazyj> Whirl3d: i see what you're doing there
[00:51:36] <Ghan> need to gather all the checked ones and the text out of the description div prev to that checkbox
[00:51:39] <Whirl3d> But do you see how it applies to hwat you are wanting.
[00:51:50] <krazyj> yeah
[00:52:31] <Whirl3d> Cool. Than I bet you can rewrite your code quickly and get just the result you want.Plus, it will be easier for us to help if you get stuck.
[00:52:33] <krazyj> Whirl3d: count the number of elements present versus use a stored index variable, yrs?
[00:52:49] <Whirl3d> I haven't even looked at your case.
[00:53:01] <Whirl3d> past the first glance. The details are yours
[00:53:12] <Whirl3d> you could store the data in each elements data object
[00:53:41] <Whirl3d> or however you wan tto get at the data. But do it once...in one place, with one handler and it will work for all of them in the future
[00:53:57] <Cork> Ghan: http://jsfiddle.net/tKbnd/3/
[00:55:32] <Cork> Ghan: or a bit cleaner http://jsfiddle.net/tKbnd/4/
[00:57:27] <coldhead> i've only been coding for 20 years though
[00:57:27] <coldhead> YMMV
[00:59:45] <Ghan> Cork: got it !
[00:59:49] <Ghan> thnx!
[01:03:06] <Whirl3d> coldhead, I thought you just started yesterday...that's what you said
[01:06:06] <farhad2161> how can i replace all "hello" to "bye" in a page when the page loaded compeletly?
[01:10:36] <Whirl3d> krazyj, here is another example of how you could use .on to handle multiple things in one method. I made a simple function that listens for clicks. If it's an "add" button, it adds a new button with an amount to the window. Clicking on that green button, adds it's value to a "total" below and removes the button
[01:11:13] <Whirl3d> imagine how much of a mess it would be trying to bind and unbind click events to so many buttons being added, then removed, then added. One function to rule them all.
[01:16:18] <Whirl3d> farhad2161, maybe something like:  var textElements=("['text']"); textElements.each(function () {var txt=$(this).text().replace("hello","bye"); $(this).text(txt);});
[01:16:41] <Whirl3d> farhad2161, ther's prolly a better text element selector $(":text') even
[01:17:48] <rethus> how can i execute a php function with ajax (to cache external files on local disk).
[01:17:48] <rethus> Thats functions need much time to copy 11000 Files. So i may try to start the script... and before timeout (59 seconds), the script should start again... and again... and again, till all stuff is loaded
[01:18:03] <Whirl3d> what is the easiest way to tell if a div has other elements in it? $(div).children().length?
[01:18:17] <Cork> yes
[01:18:18] <NodeX> or size()
[01:18:28] <NodeX> length is probaly faster
[01:18:43] <Cork> theres no size()
[01:18:53] <Cork> your thinking about another language?
[01:18:54] <NodeX> ?size
[01:18:54] <bot-t> .size(): Return the number of elements in the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/size/
[01:18:58] <NodeX> lol
[01:19:04] <Cork> O_o'
[01:19:06] <NodeX> ;)
[01:19:17] * Cork wacks api.jquery.com
[01:19:17] <NodeX> it's all about size! .. that's what she said!!
[01:19:19] <Cork> :/
[01:19:24] <Cork> it didn't list it when i searched
[01:19:42] <NodeX> the API search is pretty bad
[01:19:49] <NodeX> I get better results using google
[01:19:52] <Cork> its a bit of a pointless function though
[01:20:03] <NodeX> yer it's pointless
[01:20:05] <Cork> all it does is return this.length
[01:20:13] <NodeX> but length doesnt chain does it ?
[01:20:23] <Cork> nether does .size
[01:20:23] <Whirl3d> I am trying to tell if a div came "preloaded" or whether I need to load external content. I'm afraid that .children().length wiill return false positives if just the "structure" pieces are available...hmmm
[01:20:50] <Cork> NodeX: or if you mean ex. $().css().length, ya that works fine
[01:21:27] <NodeX> no i meant ... var foo= $().size().someThing();
[01:21:40] <NodeX> but I can't think right now how I would ever use that!
[01:21:43] <Cork> NodeX: that won't work
[01:22:01] <NodeX> then yes it's a pointless function/method
[01:22:04] <Cork> NodeX: you can't do that
[01:22:11] <Cork> size() returns the length not a jquery object
[01:22:16] <NodeX> I dont care lol, it's not me who was asking
[01:22:25] <NodeX> I use length anyway
[01:22:31] <Cork> its you who brogth up .size() :)
[01:22:39] <NodeX> they both work!
[01:22:59] <Cork> sure, but one is just a function that returns the other
[01:23:03] <Robbington> Hi, I am trying to get the responseText from an ajax call for reCaptcha, I see the call is sucessful and the the right response is given when I console.log out the response object, but when I console.log out the object.responseText I get undefined. What am I doinf wrong?
[01:23:07] <NodeX> [09:21:56] <NodeX> then yes it's a pointless function/method
[01:23:20] <Whirl3d> var pages=section.find(".page");
[01:23:21] <Whirl3d> 		pages=pages.filter(function () {if ($(this).children().length) {return null} return $(this);});
[01:23:51] <Cork> Robbington: by object you mean the jqxhr ?
[01:24:58] <Robbington> cork, I have a pastebin of my code if you could take a look? http://pastebin.com/2Ev008ZK
[01:25:10] <rethus> how can i execute a external php-function via ajax, that needs much more time than max_execution in php give... and recall it, till all needed stuff is done?
[01:25:34] <NodeX> rethus : your serverside should be handling it
[01:25:49] <rethus> what you mean?
[01:25:53] <Cork> Robbington: you can't return values from the callbacks
[01:26:07] <NodeX> your PHP script should be doing the work not jQuery after the initial request
[01:26:30] <Cork> Robbington: $.ajax returns a jqxhr object and you can return that object
[01:26:35] <rethus> NodeX, but it takes longer than max_timeout.. so i need ajax to trigger the script again and again
[01:26:39] <NodeX> if you really need *ajax functions to do it then you'll have to poll your PHP script
[01:26:48] <Cork> Robbington: but you need to bind the .success handler from where you want it
[01:26:59] <NodeX> if it takes longer than max timeout then the script isnt working anyway
[01:27:56] <rethus> so i think maybe this way:
[01:27:56] <rethus> php_functions break loop after 59 seconds ( 1second before timeout) and give the actual csv-row back... jquery get this, and trigger the php-script with the csv-row as offset again.
[01:28:01] <NodeX> What i would suggest you do is dont overload your PHP for no reason .. install a message queue like rabbitMQ or somehting and let that take care of it
[01:28:03] <Ricaz> If I have 10 elements with the same class (.item) and I want to split them into groups of 4 to only display one group at a time?
[01:28:34] <NodeX> then if you need the status of the queue then poll a script to find it out
[01:28:41] <rethus> NodeX: k, if you can tell me another way to copy more than 11000 external files for caching to local folder... i'll be glad
[01:28:51] <rethus> or even get this in less than 60 seconds :)
[01:28:53] <NodeX> set_time_limit(0)
[01:29:15] <rethus> k, i'll try it
[01:30:23] <Ricaz> Anyone? :)
[01:30:32] <henn1nk> if/close
[01:30:58] <NodeX> There was no question Ricaz, just a statement
[01:31:11] <Robbington> cork: I am unsure what you mean, could you give me an example or point me in the right direction?
[01:31:36] <Ricaz> If I have 10 elements with the same class (.item) and I want to split them into groups of 4 to only display one group at a time, how do I do that?
[01:31:38] <Ricaz> better?
[01:31:55] <NodeX> yourArray.slice(0,4);
[01:32:12] <NodeX> then 5,8
[01:32:18] <NodeX> sorry 0,3 then 5,8
[01:33:15] <Ricaz> and I put them into an array by just using $('.item')?
[01:35:15] <NodeX> you can probably do somethingt like  var list=$('.item'); .. for (i=0;i<=3;i++) { console.log(list[i]); list.shift(); }
[01:36:01] <NodeX> that will log 4 items removing the last item/object from the list each time
[01:36:21] <Robbington> cork: Scratch that, its early and I was just being thick. thanks for your help. :)
[01:37:05] <Cork> Robbington: sorry about the delay, got a bit busy
[01:50:49] <Robbington> cork: Actually, still struggling with this, so I have set up a success : function(reponse) which returns the textReponse I want, but request.success still returns the whole object and I cant get to the string...
[01:51:15] <Cork> Robbington: no you missed the point :)
[01:52:04] <Cork> function wrapper() {return $.ajax() }; wrapper().success(function(data) {});
[01:52:21] <Cork> Robbington: you can't EVER return data from the connection
[01:52:31] <Cork> its async so you need to wait for it
[02:00:18] <Robbington> cork: But surely that is what I am doing, I am assigning the request varible to jQuery.ajax({}) inside my function verifyCaptha and verifyCaptcha returns request. but verifyCaptcha.success = object.
[02:00:39] <Robbington> and object.responseText = undefined.
[02:00:51] <Cork> Robbington: could you pb the updated code?
[02:00:58] <Cork> (preferably in jsfiddle)
[02:05:17] <Robbington> cork: Sure, any help is greatly appricated. http://jsfiddle.net/m5euQ/
[02:24:17] <Ricaz> I'm confused as how to do this. I want to only show 4 items at a time. Then show the next 4 items when a button is clicked. I having trouble splitting up the items. Here is the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/uqgJ5/2/
[02:27:58] <sanova> hi
[02:28:51] <Ricaz> I guess you can't add the slice to an array?
[02:28:55] <sanova> is there a way to have datetimepicker with dropdown hours and minutes and not slide bar?
[02:46:36] <JTallis> Here is a snippet http://pastebin.com/N4yLBZjv from http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring and I'm not understanding it very well. I've never used prototype before, arguments isn't defined from what I see... and .apply - I have never used this before. Can someone explain what it 's actually doing?
[02:51:07] <Whirl3d> arguments refers to the arguments passed to a function
[02:51:32] <Whirl3d> function (a,b,c) { a, b,c are "named arguments"
[02:52:08] <Whirl3d> but javascript doesn't stop there, you could have any number of additional arguments or ignore those "named" arguments all together when passing "arguments" to a function
[02:52:57] <Whirl3d> Apply changes the scope of the function you are applying
[02:53:33] <dejan777> $(window).resize not working in ie 8 for me :0 anybody knows what's wrong?
[02:53:51] <JTallis> So 'arguments' is a predefined variable?
[02:54:17] <Cork> JTallis: its defined inside all functions yes
[02:55:03] <JTallis> Ok, and by this ... Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 ), in that snippet you basically call that function with the method and it's args. It slices the array so it cuts away the first arg (the method)
[02:55:03] <JTallis> Yes?
[02:55:12] <Whirl3d> dejan777, hold on, I'm consulting my crystal ball....
[02:55:39] <Whirl3d> dejan777, oh, it says you made a mistake somewhere in your code...and that you should paste it to jsfiddle if you want help.
[02:55:43] <Cork> JTallis: it handles arguments as an array and returns everything except the first one yes
[02:56:05] <JTallis> the .apply method just applies the arguments?
[02:56:14] <Whirl3d> and the scope
[02:56:15] <dejan777> Whirl3d oh well.. all i am doing on window resize are some width/height changes of some elements and it works perfectly in all other browsers... only it ie it isn't working at all :(
[02:56:34] <Cork> JTallis: appy and call takes what will be this as the first argument
[02:56:37] <Cork> *apply
[02:56:54] <JTallis> Why is 'this' passed to it?
[02:57:00] <Whirl3d> wow, in that case, I'd have to say: THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG IN YOUR CODE. but I don't know what your code looks like, so why not paste a copy of it to jsfiddle for help.
[02:57:15] <Cork> ?eval function t() { print this; }; t.call(5);
[02:57:17] <dejan777> NO MY CODE IS PERFECT
[02:57:17] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[02:57:18] <dejan777> :D
[02:57:22] <dejan777> ok thx anyway
[02:57:26] <Whirl3d> undoubtedly.
[02:57:29] <Cork> ?eval function t() { print(this); }; t.call(5);
[02:57:30] <bot-t> Cork: 5
[02:57:58] <JTallis> I don't understand that that is doing...
[02:58:00] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing Where I have the "more…" jQuery at the top of the page on the short description, it works great, however when I click a drop-down box (below it) it removes the more part form above,  why?
[02:58:10] <Cork> JTallis: see ?mdc call and see ?mdc apply
[02:58:11] <bot-t> JTallis, apply - MDN - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[02:58:25] <Cork> bot-t: you fail! :/
[02:58:26] <bot-t> Cork, Yes.
[02:59:24] <Whirl3d> JTallis, basically what that line says is: "using the first element as "THIS" for the function, apply the rest of the arguments to it and run the fucnction.
[03:00:21] <dejan777> Whirl3d i have created a function, let's call it calculations( ). if i call the function on document ready it works good but if i call it on window resize it doesn't work at all X_X that's why i am so confused... ok i will post on jsfiddle
[03:00:48] <Whirl3d> Right on.
[03:01:51] <JTallis> is "this" passed to the .apply function so that the functions are able to access variables defined in the global scope?
[03:02:28] <JTallis> and functions.
[03:03:41] <Xotix> How can exclude a form element from beeing submitted?
[03:06:22] <Whirl3d> This is basically what I have taken away from all that confusing closure /plugin stuff.   when you create a plugin that you want to be able to use like $(element).pluginName(props);    you are actually extending the jquery.fn function whifch all jquery objects have access to. But you could also offer the $.pluginName(elements, opts) to extend the jquery object....so it doesn't require $(someelement)
[03:06:22] <Whirl3d> .plugin     it's just $.plugin
[03:06:49] <Ricaz> I'm trying to use this: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide
[03:06:54] <Ricaz> is it outdated or something? doesn't work.
[03:11:45] <Whirl3d> Then, to change between the two plugin nomenclatures, a lot of plugins do something like: $.plugin=function (sel, opts) { ///since a selector was passed as the first argument, what I really want is the $.fn.plugin , but appplied to that selector. so, you would do $(sel).pluginName(Array.prototype.slide.apply(arguments, 1))    which looks confusing but really isn't.
[03:15:23] <Whirl3d> you could do [a,b,c].slice(1) to return [b,c]   for example, because [a,b,c] is an array. Since we want that same functionationality, but we don't have a literal array (arguments is an objectspecial case), we borrow the functionality from Array's constructor and apply it to arguments, passing 1 as the parameter...we wished we could just do arguments.slice(1);
[03:16:24] <Fox`> Can you not check if a checkbox is checked if it's already checked via the checked="checked" attribute?
[03:16:47] <Whirl3d> yes
[03:17:22] <Whirl3d> Ricaz, it still works. Perhaps you could post an example of it failing to jsfiddle and we could help
[03:17:42] <Ricaz> Okay
[03:18:10] <Whirl3d> Xotix, let me look back at the logs for the last week to see how many people have answered that question for you. Maybe it'll jog your memory a little. If not, I'll see what I can do. brb
[03:19:45] <Xotix> Whirld3d, hm? I never asked anything about forms. :) Anyway its okay, don't bother
[03:19:48] <Xotix> but thx
[03:25:36] <GoGGo> Hi, everybody, I have a problem with the fancybox plugin, after an ajax request, when the content is loaded the fancybox stuff doesn'work but the others events are bworking properly
[03:31:09] <Sabe> Hi
[03:31:24] <JTallis> Sorry Whirl3d I've been afk - I understand the slice part. However you go on about 2 different plugins now, .plugin and .pluginName which threw me off. I basically when I made plugins before, added more than one namespace to a plugin, but I also do var Func = function ( .... ) { ... }
[03:31:41] <Sabe> I would like to give a break in this list after every third element but not the first. Actually I would like to have a max of 3 icons on every row. http://jsfiddle.net/v3xuS/1/
[03:31:43] <JTallis> and looking on the plugin docs, adding more than one namespace is wrong.
[03:31:50] <JTallis> well, bad... is the term they used.
[03:31:54] <Sabe> thank you. Trying to figur it out but just not wrking
[03:32:14] <Xotix> Can someone tell me what forms.jquery.js uses for the ajax uploading? I know that it uses iframe for the ie but for all other browser it does what?
[03:32:53] <JTallis> So I looked to try find a better way to handle my plugins, but it's just confusing.
[03:33:17] <Whirl3d> right. The convention is to check your list of methods agains the first argument and if the first argument is a method, calll that method with the rest of the arguments.   slideShow('"stop")   for example
[03:34:18] <Whirl3d> JTallis, what does your plugin do?
[03:35:53] <JTallis> http://pastebin.com/vD0AK4YZ I attempted to add comments to the snippet I provided earlier. Stuck on the else if though. I've got plugins for password meters, scrollbars and numerous things but I wanted to ideally look at how you are suppose to do plugins
[03:36:13] <Ricaz> so my paging script kinda works now, but it only works for one list at a time. Can anyone help me with making the same script work seperately for two lists?: http://jsfiddle.net/uqgJ5/4/ - if the second .box is outcommented, it works fine
[03:38:00] <Ricaz> I'm thinking making the groups an array with 2 arrays (one for each list), but I dont know how
[03:38:11] <tomThumb> Hi
[03:39:59] <tomThumb> I was trying slidetoggle and attached it to the click event of a button.  Now in Firebug console if I execute slidetogge() it works properly but if I click the button the div dissapers and appears again.  The same thing happens when I execute the jQuery("#myButton").click() function.
[03:40:19] <tomThumb> Any pointers?
[03:40:53] <chow> Hi, how can i know if data contains a certain string or text in jquery?
[03:41:20] <tomThumb> chow, just put alert(data) somewhere in the code.
[03:42:01] <chow> tomThumb, i did but now i want to make a condition in case the data contains a certain string, i am sending different text to data each time..
[03:42:54] <tomThumb> chow, I thing javascript has some sort of regexp functions.
[03:44:24] <tomThumb> chow, check http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_obj_regexp.asp
[03:44:55] <Whirl3d> sorry JTallis, I added commments to your tooltip plugin
[03:44:57] <chow> i dont think i need regexp because its a static word, but thanks for giving me a hint, now i know what to do :)
[03:45:40] <JTallis> the tooltip thing was a snippet from http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring I was just trying to understand it.
[03:45:54] <Ricaz> creating arrays in arrays.. :s groups[i].push(allItems.slice(x, y)); why doesn't it work?
[03:47:16] <Fox`> When I do $('#mycheckbox:checked').length I get 11 for unchecked and 12 for checked o_O
[03:55:07] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing Where I have the "more…" jQuery at the top of the page on the short description, it works great, however when I click a drop-down box (below it) it removes the more part form above,  why?
[03:57:34] <dwarder_> what does this mean var pushNewFreeBusy = function(_f) {if (_f.isValid()) newFreeBusys.push(_f);};
[03:57:44] <dwarder_> does _f means something special in jquery
[03:57:45] <dwarder_> ?
[03:58:27] <nFFF> no just naming style
[03:58:38] <nFFF> _ usually represents private
[03:59:00] <nFFF> as javascript doesn't actually have native private, public, protected etc member types like in other langugaes
[03:59:28] <dwarder_> i see
[03:59:32] <dwarder_> nFFF: thanks
[03:59:54] <nFFF> dwarder_, more useful when you have multiple people working on a project
[04:00:07] <nFFF> lets you co-developers how methods are intended to be used
[04:00:37] <dwarder_> nFFF: i just don't understand where they get the _f in the code
[04:01:08] <dwarder_> nFFF: trying to dig weekCalendar jqury ui plugin
[04:01:13] <nFFF> it's passed in as an argument
[04:01:31] <nFFF> pushNewFreeBusy(thiswillbe_f)
[04:02:49] <dwarder_> nFFF: how this construction is called, where can i get more info about it?
[04:03:07] <nFFF> no idea what you mean
[04:03:09] <nFFF> :|
[04:05:18] <dwarder_> nFFF: ok, i guess i just need to understand that if i assign a certain var that is a function a value with an anonymous function that has _f as an argument, that modified argument in the anonymous function will be an argument to the first function?
[04:07:29] <nFFF> sounds like inception
[04:08:11] <dwarder_> nFFF: does it sound like a right logic, at least? :)
[04:08:15] <dwarder_> sounds*
[04:08:18] <dwarder_> oops
[04:08:21] <dwarder_> sound*
[04:09:02] <nFFF> I dont understand the sentence, so not sure
[04:09:06] <nFFF> Perhaps someone else can help
[04:09:16] <dwarder_> nFFF: thank you
[04:09:47] <tobyg> sup
[04:10:00] <nFFF> _f is obviously an object that is being passed to pushNewFreeBusy, _f has a function isValid() that returns a boolean
[04:10:17] <nFFF> if it returns true, its pushed onto the array newFreeBusys[]
[04:15:05] <joris> Hi. What is the preferred way of transporting a variable from the scope where $.post() is called, to the scope of its callback function?
[04:19:19] <Ricaz> Can you do something like this? $(this).parent().attr('rel', '+=1');
[04:20:26] <fRAiLtY-> Why can I not echo PHP in these tabs? http://jsfiddle.net/J2LV7/1/
[04:20:52] <joris> what do you mean echo PHP ?
[04:21:35] <JTallis> What happens when you try fRAiLtY? This is more of a PHP issue than a jQuery issue.
[04:22:24] <fRAiLtY-> The php output is nothing. I'm running it on a live site and the php doesn't seem to execute within the js tabs. Outside of it it's fine
[04:22:28] <fRAiLtY-> I'm just trying to understand why
[04:22:40] <JTallis> Whats the link to the live site?
[04:22:41] <fRAiLtY-> It's not a php question as such as the php works, it's just feeding it through the js tabs
[04:22:50] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[04:22:58] <fRAiLtY-> The FAQ and Reviews tab at the bottom has some PHP in it
[04:23:02] <fRAiLtY-> shows blank
[04:23:10] <fRAiLtY-> But if I put it elsewhere outside of the js tabs it's fine.
[04:23:45] <lupian> hello
[04:24:08] <JTallis> .productquestions-summary and .ratings have a display: none;
[04:24:10] <JTallis> on the inline styling.
[04:24:26] <pedro370> greetings. I'm trying to generate a dynamic list of links based on a JSON string. I want to be able to click on the links and pass a value to a function. I've tried with JSON2HTML plugin but was not successful. Any suggestions?
[04:24:33] <joris> yeah. its neither JS nor PHP, just a CSS problem
[04:24:42] <JTallis> and so does everythin else in there, fRAiLtY
[04:24:58] <lupian> i wrote a jquery code in a header.php , with index.php works while other pages .php does not work ... why?
[04:24:59] <fRAiLtY-> JTallis: Really? How are you seeing that
[04:25:11] <joris> fRAiLtY-: Web Inspector in Chrome or Safari
[04:25:29] <joris> fRAiLtY-: right click the empty space and hit Inspect Element, browse the result source code
[04:25:38] <joris> It's got display:none all over
[04:25:47] <JTallis> ^ that's if he's using chrome
[04:25:52] <JTallis> or firebug with firefox
[04:26:07] <fRAiLtY-> Ok, on another note, http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing Where I have the "more…" jQuery at the top of the page on the short description, it works great, however when I click a drop-down box (below it) it removes the more part form above,  why?
[04:26:37] <pedro370> this is my code atm without the JSON2HTML version http://jsfiddle.net/wLeEL/
[04:27:22] <lupian> Why my jquery's code work only in index.php? If i open other php pages of my web site , does not work.....
[04:28:34] <fRAiLtY-> JTallis: Nono, only the active tab has display:block, the others rightly have display none. But in tab 2 I have a php echo. Select Tab 2 (FAQ & Reviews) and check the inline style then, it's block.
[04:28:57] <JTallis> Look here fRAiLty- http://vvcap.net/db/OrotwTjfeejYL3zu_BTF.htp
[04:29:03] <JTallis> It's an image with inspect elem open
[04:29:25] <JTallis> I hovered over tab 2 so it's highlighted the content, but everything in it is display: none
[04:29:27] <pedro370> has anyone here used JSON2HTML
[04:29:41] <txm> Afternoon, could anyone help with a negated select? <div class="professional"> and this is good var inputs = $('div.users.form > form > fieldset > div'); but .. this not() works on all elements, not just the divs I've captured :( $(inputs+':not(type)').hide(999);
[04:36:09] <fRAiLtY-> JTallis: got it, ta
[04:36:21] <fRAiLtY-> Any help with the other issue?
[04:36:23] <fRAiLtY-> the more… thing?
[04:37:34] <JTallis> do your drop downs have any js attached to them, fRAiLty?
[04:38:44] <rethus> can someone tell me whats wrong here?
[04:38:45] <rethus> click on "Filter, than add Filter.... there is a button "more"... click it repeatly....
[04:38:45] <rethus> now the image in front of the line should remove the line.... but the handling on this buttons take no effct:
[04:38:45] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/suther/LAQ9F/embedded/result/
[04:39:05] <rethus> you can see the sourcecode if click upper-richt on plus
[04:40:49] <fRAiLtY-> JTallis: prototype I think
[04:41:35] <rethus> each line of filter has a own id like filterRow_1... filterRow_2

[04:45:02] <Trisox> ?on
[04:45:03] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:45:09] <Trisox> take a look at that
[04:45:48] <PhonicUK> hey all
[04:46:08] <Trisox> .on('click', fun...
[04:46:44] <Trisox> rethus
[04:47:23] <rethus> Trisox: k, i'll try this. But only to learn something... what do you think, why i need to do this? cause many buttons named class="deleteFilterRow"?
[04:47:50] <Trisox> no cause you dynamicly add a new one and there is no event binded to it
[04:47:52] <Trisox> so...
[04:47:58] <Trisox> ;)
[04:48:21] <rethus> ah, i understand. when does events bind to the elements normaly
[04:48:34] <Trisox> when dom is done?
[04:48:47] <Trisox> then events get attached most of the time
[04:49:00] <Trisox> ill dont get in to detail
[04:50:05] <rethus> k, but example didn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/suther/LAQ9F/6/embedded/result/
[04:50:35] <rethus> normaly return false should prevent from submitting the form
[04:51:01] <lupian> i wrote a jquery code in a header.php file , when i load this file from index.php , works ... if i load header.php from other php pages , the jquery code does not work ... why?
[04:52:12] <rethus> check your source-code, where your inclusion-path is...
[04:52:17] <pachet> is it inline within the script tag, or do you specify a src?
[04:52:20] <pachet> sounds like a bad path
[04:53:00] <rethus> ../jquery.js is not in every context point to jquery.js... so use getcwd in php or absolute path
[04:53:01] <lupian> i wrote it beetween <script></script> in head
[04:54:18] <rethus> show example-files on jsfiddle or pastebin.com
[04:54:28] <rethus> Trisox: any idea?
[04:54:32] <Trisox> rethus: your $('.deleteFilterRow').on('click',function() { doesnt do anything
[04:54:48] <lupian> ok i post it
[04:55:14] <rethus> it wirte a text to firebug-console and return false to prevent from page new loading...
[04:55:24] <rethus> but this not work Trisox:
[04:57:38] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/LAQ9F/7/
[04:57:39] <Trisox> there
[04:58:36] <rethus> so "live" is the magic?
[04:58:46] <pachet> it's definitely not magic
[04:58:46] <Trisox> on should work
[04:59:36] <Trisox> somekind of magic !!
[05:00:14] <rethus> :D great. thanks. So i keep in mind, if creating html-tags after DOM_Create, i have to register these elements with live to catch events of it
[05:00:58] <rethus> but please tell me, what that line do:
[05:00:58] <rethus> e.prevendDefault();
[05:01:21] <Trisox> e.prevendDefault lol
[05:01:22] <Trisox> typo
[05:01:23] <Trisox> :D
[05:01:47] <Trisox> e.preventDefault

[05:16:21] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/HD6FA/
[05:16:48] <LordThumper> checbox change is still fired even if I preventDefault() in the onclick handler
[05:16:56] <rethus> i think i know it know
[05:17:11] <rethus> on('click',function...
[05:17:50] <lupian> then this is my header.php file with jquery code http://pastebin.com/ZefdumX4
[05:18:12] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/suther/HD6FA/1/
[05:18:18] <rethus> this works right now?
[05:18:22] <lupian> if i load header.php in my index.php , it works ,but with other pages does not work
[05:18:39] <LordThumper> Would really appreciate it if someone gave it a look
[05:19:20] <rethus> sign your files... which is index.php
[05:20:12] <rethus> first one is header, second one index.php?
[05:20:27] <rethus> lupian:
[05:20:27] <lupian> yes
[05:20:51] <lupian> i mean the second script in header file
[05:21:05] <rethus> so here is a realy easy way to find your error on your own...
[05:21:06] <rethus> Do you have installed firebug?
[05:21:12] <lupian> yes
[05:21:29] <rethus> so oben your file, where jquery not works.
[05:22:06] <lupian> when i open the page with firebug i see all ok
[05:22:14] <lupian> the path its right
[05:22:21] <LordThumper> rethus: http://jsfiddle.net/HD6FA/1 code hasnt changed
[05:23:08] <rethus> lupian: couldn't be, otherway, jquery would work... so so this...
[05:23:22] <rethus> oben HTML-view in firebug
[05:23:44] <rethus> open your node Head... an open your script-file-tags
[05:24:05] <lupian> ok now i try again
[05:24:42] <rethus> LordThumper  http://jsfiddle.net/suther/HD6FA/2/
[05:25:07] <rethus> lupian: did you see the js-code inside of this tag, or only a 404 error warning
[05:25:51] <_|Nix|_> Hey! D'you guys know if there's a channel on freenode where I can ask n00b CSS questions?
[05:26:18] <rethus> #web or #cc
[05:26:20] <lupian> rethus: i dont see a 404 error
[05:26:21] <rethus> s
[05:26:27] <rethus> #css
[05:26:36] <lupian> rethus: i see all ok like in index.php file
[05:26:39] <_|Nix|_> rethus: Thanks!
[05:26:46] <rethus> np
[05:26:58] <lupian> i see same code
[05:27:28] <shoky> LordThumper: change event fires BEFORE click event
[05:27:31] <rethus> so if your jquery is load well, go on and debug with firebug the script... step by step
[05:28:10] <lupian> hmm ok now i look again ...
[05:28:30] <rethus> to help you debugging ... put your (HTML)-Code to jsfiddle
[05:28:36] <rethus> (not your php-code)
[05:28:49] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net
[05:29:28] <lupian> ok now i post it
[05:30:51] <lupian> rethus: do you need all pages ?
[05:31:02] <rethus> maybe post both one... with index.php include... and other file include
[05:31:11] <rethus> only your result-HTML-output
[05:31:15] <lupian> ok
[05:31:53] <rethus> don't forget to tell, what the js-script should do (you not tell it till now)
[05:32:46] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/suther/HD6FA/2/
[05:32:47] <LordThumper> ?
[05:32:52] <LordThumper> Doesn't even work
[05:34:37] <lupian> then this is the index.php http://jsfiddle.net/WUVXG/
[05:34:53] <lupian> it's a banal script
[05:34:59] <rethus> LordThumper: what for you need such a script... don't see, wehy onclick should prevent change-event
[05:35:12] <lupian> i wanted do a reset button :D
[05:35:57] <rethus> copy the sourcecode of your css-file upper-right css-boc
[05:36:00] <rethus> box

[06:17:42] <arnpro> hey guys, im making a game UI, all driven with jquery, however the events and other stuff are attached to classes and by finding .parent() and stuff, my question is how can I stop the user from firebugging the code and taking advantage of it? what are best practices for this kind of things?
[06:18:20] <shoky> nice question
[06:18:36] <Lachezar> Hello. Newbie here. I have extended autocomplete to suit my needs, but I'm doing it in every instance. How do I sub-clas autocomplete so that I do not need to copy-paste my extensions?
[06:19:22] <Lachezar> Currently: $(function(){ $('#field').autocomplete({...much here...})});
[06:19:23] <shoky> arnpro: i assume minifying and/or obfuscating the code isn't enough for you?
[06:20:16] <Twilo> shoky: how can i get the complete content?
[06:20:27] <arnpro> don't think so, shoky, because the user could simply change classes of the dom elements, and unexpected behavior may happen, isn't there any way to like attach events and behaviors to the elements themselves? like even if user touches dom, UI keeps going as expected
[06:20:44] <shoky> Twilo: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CCSQp/3/
[06:21:02] <shoky> arnpro: is this a multiplayer game?
[06:21:10] <shoky> or something with highscores?
[06:21:35] <shoky> arnpro you can't stop the user from controlling their own browser...
[06:21:53] <shoky> unless you wanna use flash or some crap ;)
[06:23:21] <arnpro> I understand... yea JS will only be for the UI, the validations will be server side aswell, so no problem, however I was wondering if there's something else I'm missing about js programming to avoid this kind of stuff
[06:23:29] <shoky> you could also just make the game on a canvas and get more hardcore with the graphics making it harder for the user to just change something by changing an element's class
[06:25:06] <Ankabout> how do I add something to the end of a URL in a jquery script?
[06:25:15] <Ankabout> I want to add an anchor to the end of the URL
[06:25:36] <Twilo> shoky: that is not the complete content of the variable responseText, that is only the content from the first div\
[06:25:55] <shoky> Twilo: jquery is not a string manipulation library
[06:26:07] <shoky> javascript has enough of that
[06:27:16] <Lachezar> I want to follow jQuery style, but I'd like to use two elements. How to do that? $('#field1', '#field2').process(...)
[06:28:15] <arnpro> Lachezar: if you're talking about 2 selectors, $('#field1, #field2').process(...) is enough I think
[06:28:37] <Chib> yep
[06:28:47] <shoky> Twilo: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CCSQp/4/
[06:28:49] <Twilo> http://jsfiddle.net/CCSQp/5/
[06:28:52] <Lachezar> arnpro: Really? And how would the function look like? How do I declare such a function?
[06:28:58] <shoky> hah :)
[06:29:06] <Twilo> :-)
[06:29:10] <Jon47> Lachezar: if you provide two parameters to the jquery function it uses a different function signature, the second parameter is the "context" to search within for the css selector in the first parameter
[06:29:14] <shoky> mine is prettier
[06:29:21] <shoky> !
[06:29:28] <Twilo> jo, thanks
[06:29:32] <Chib> Lachezar: exactly as you wrote it
[06:30:21] <Lachezar> Jon47: So that's a no, can't do that... Damn. Back to new Suggester(document.getElementById(), document.getElementById()) :(
[06:30:54] <Jon47> Lachezar: no no, you can just use the comma in the first parameter, the css selector string, just like in CSS, to match multiple selectors…
[06:30:54] <Chib> Lachezar: what are you trying to do?
[06:31:51] <Lachezar> Chib: Suggester component. Similar to Autocomplete, but has an ID field and a Text field.
[06:32:23] <shoky> Lachezar you can declare any function on jQuery objects by: $.fn.myPlugin = function(...) {...}
[06:33:05] <Chib> you're confusing him with too much info (:
[06:33:16] <shoky> he's confusing us with too little
[06:33:25] <Chib> true (:
[06:33:45] <Lachezar> No, not really. I am looking forward to this, but jQuery makes the weird JavaScript look even weirder 9which I thought was not possible). No offense meant!
[06:33:47] <Chib> Lachezar: why do you need 2 elements to do that?
[06:34:10] <shoky> i'm sure at least 6 people here were offended by that
[06:34:17] <shoky> outrageous
[06:34:38] <Lachezar> Chib: User writes in the text field, a pop-up with matching elements' name shows, user selects one, ant the ID of that element is put in the hidden IDD field.
[06:34:43] <Lachezar> IDD = ID.
[06:35:30] <Lachezar> shoky: Sorry. I come from Java and C, and C++, and JavaScript has evolved like a ZERG :). jQuery made it look easy to use but a NIGHTMARE to understand.
[06:35:43] <shoky> lol
[06:35:59] <Lachezar> And I _NEED_ to understand.
[06:36:10] <shoky> Lachezar: what don't you understand
[06:36:20] <qvarkk> jquery nested sortables - can someone give me a hint to create a nice list sort function with hierarchy?
[06:36:25] <Lachezar> shoky: Easy question with no easy answer :(
[06:36:41] <shoky> make us a demo on jsfiddle.net
[06:37:00] <Chib> you should run through some of the basic tutorials, it's actually pretty  easy to understand once you go through those: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[06:37:10] <johnkpaul> ?learn @Lachezar
[06:37:10] <bot-t> Lachezar, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[06:37:16] <Lachezar> shoky: There is a library that does that, but it's prototype based... Let me dig it out...
[06:37:21] <omnipotent1_> Hi, I'm looking for an image zoom plugin that doesn't zoom in if the photo isn't big enough to warrant it.  Any suggestions?
[06:37:24] <shoky> wat
[06:38:39] <shoky> you only wanna zoom in on big photos?
[06:38:45] <omnipotent1_> yeah
[06:39:14] <shoky> what makes small photos not zoom-worthy?
[06:39:26] <omnipotent1_> because they get grainy
[06:39:31] <Lachezar> shoky: http://ajaxtags.sourceforge.net
[06:40:11] <shoky> Lachezar: i have no idea why you're giving me this link
[06:40:27] <Lachezar> shoky: new AjaxJspTag.Autocomplete('/suggest.do', {source: 'userName', target: 'userId', parameters : 'pattern={userName}'});
[06:40:49] <shoky> hmmm?
[06:41:28] <Lachezar> shoky: That's what the library does: attaches to the userName field, where you can write stuff, and it will pop-up matching users, when the user chooses one it puts the user ID in the userId field.
[06:41:47] <Lachezar> shoky: And it uses AJAX to obtain the list of matching users.
[06:42:02] <shoky> hokay
[06:42:07] <wild_oscar> I'm looking for an eye candy element, tooltip style, that can be populated with contents taken from an ajax call. ie, user clicks "more info" and the info is retrieved and shown in a pretty tooltip
[06:42:15] <wild_oscar> any suggestions on what to use?
[06:42:23] <Lachezar> shoky: An autocomplete field is used to fill in the text, a suggester is used to select one out of many.
[06:42:41] <Lachezar> shoky: An alternative to a <select> where you can have many and many elements.
[06:43:10] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: what is your question? ajaxtags doesn't use jQuery, I don't believe
[06:43:47] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: Yes, it does not. I need to use jQuery and I am trying to achieve the same goal... :(
[06:44:01] <shoky> which is?
[06:44:07] <shoky> oh
[06:44:07] <johnkpaul> have you looked at the jquery ui documentation for their autocomplete?
[06:44:11] <johnkpaul> you can do it with very similar syntax
[06:44:21] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: I am pretty close. I made it work.
[06:44:22] <Shwaiil> hi
[06:44:29] <Lachezar> Now I need to package it for reusal.
[06:44:38] <johnkpaul> shoky: he wants to imitate a jsp (java world) library with jQuery
[06:44:43] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: and I hit a hard rock there.
[06:44:54] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: you built your own autocomplete from scratch?
[06:44:55] <Shwaiil> Q: How to get the selector as string ? Let's say for $('.foo') get 'foo' ? How to do that ? thanks
[06:45:13] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: No, *of course* not. Extended autocomplete()
[06:45:37] <johnkpaul> extended jquery ui's autocomplete?
[06:45:44] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: Yep.
[06:45:48] <johnkpaul> Shwaiil: .selector on your jquery object
[06:45:56] <johnkpaul> ?eval $(".foo").selector
[06:46:05] <shoky> !
[06:46:22] <Shwaiil> johnkpaul: thanks for looking. I'll test that again, I think it wasn't available, or when, returned empty string
[06:46:26] <Shwaiil> just a sec
[06:46:37] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: so what do you mean "for reuse"?
[06:46:38] <shoky> jkp thnx, i wish i didnt know what jsp's were ;)
[06:46:51] <Xotix> Does Cors work for ie8,9?
[06:47:02] <johnkpaul> shoky: :) I actually didn't mind JSPs after El syntax in version 3 I think?
[06:47:10] <johnkpaul> taglibraries were horribly annoying though
[06:47:16] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: For the time being it looks like this: $('userName').autocomplete({... lot of stuff here...}).
[06:47:22] <rethus> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-close whatsfor the event, and ui parameter in the beforeClose function?
[06:47:34] <johnkpaul> Xotix: 8+ I believe
[06:47:39] <shoky> ahh we haven't used barely any EL at all heh
[06:47:45] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: ok, what's wrong with that
[06:47:49] <johnkpaul> shoky: oh, then I feel bad for you
[06:47:50] <xckpd7> question: I'm researching performance tips... seeing that using a for statement is more efficient than each... but what if I need to do $(this).html()?
[06:48:06] <qawsedrf> i am having some problem with jquery ui. click event on anchor tags do not trigger in dragable, anyone faced similar issue ?
[06:48:06] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: I want it to be like this: $('userName').my_autocomplete({target: 'userId', source: '/path/to/service.svc'});
[06:48:15] <johnkpaul> shoky: you use the usebean and write's everywhere? that's hell
[06:48:15] <shoky> jkp: i'm sure if done properly they're fine. it's just a huge sloppy mess at my workplace ;)
[06:48:49] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: ok, so have you read about how to write jquery plugins? if you already have it working as an extension of autocomplete, it is comparatively trivial to make it into a jquery plgugin
[06:48:56] * Lachezar Has ejected JSP from J2EE: Freemarker FTW!!!
[06:49:00] <shoky> jkp: just horrible html mixed with java mixed with javascript mixed with sql mixed with anything you wanna mix ;)
[06:49:18] <johnkpaul> ah, yes, that is a different story, I've seen some jsp's that make sql queries and I ran away
[06:49:23] <shoky> :)
[06:49:29] <Xotix> johnkpaul: thx
[06:49:40] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: if everyone else agreed with you, we'd be better off, but sadly jsp is a standard and part of every servlet container ootb
[06:49:42] <johnkpaul> Xotix: no problem
[06:50:03] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: shoky: The sql tag libraries are the horror. They were made to make jsp like php :)
[06:50:06] <shoky> hopefully soon we're gonna rebuild our whole web platform, the right way
[06:50:16] <qawsedrf> i am having some problem with jquery ui. click event on anchor tags do not trigger in dragable, anyone faced similar issue ?
[06:50:26] <Xotix> johnkpaul but for what does ie use it? IE doesn't allow post request cross domain anyway, you have to use xdomainrequest. right?
[06:50:36] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: Whether to use JSP or not is _MY_ choice. And I chose Spring + JPA + Freemarker.
[06:51:30] <johnkpaul> Xotix: yes, it doesn't have the same interface, but I'm pretty sure that there are shims for it out there
[06:51:45] <Xotix> johnkpaul shims?
[06:51:48] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: then you are in a good position to make those decisions
[06:51:55] <Twilo> shoky: when the html code has new lines, then the output html code includes the word undefined http://jsfiddle.net/CCSQp/6/
[06:51:58] <Ankabout> how would I find an element that has a certain text?
[06:52:03] <johnkpaul> Xotix: http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/
[06:52:12] <Ankabout> it's nested in 2 other elements
[06:52:21] <omnipotent1_> hey johnkpaul
[06:52:33] <johnkpaul> ?:contains @Ankabout
[06:52:34] <bot-t> Ankabout, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[06:52:44] <johnkpaul> hey omnipotent1_
[06:53:05] <Ankabout> oh cool, thanks johnkpaul
[06:53:12] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: It seems to me, I'll have to stick to a function that does all the necessary wiring up to avoid repeating myself.
[06:53:12] <johnkpaul> Ankabout: no problem, have fun
[06:53:34] <Ankabout> johnkpaul, and can I simulate a click on that element?
[06:53:39] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: yeah, so you can extend jQuery.fn to do that
[06:53:39] <Ankabout> without someone actually clicking
[06:54:02] <johnkpaul> Ankabout: yes, you can, but depending on what you want that click to do, it is more or less complicated
[06:54:09] <shoky> Twilo: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CCSQp/8/
[06:54:10] <Lachezar> $('input[type="button"]').click()

[06:54:13] <bot-t> Lachezar, addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns  GitHub - https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns
[06:54:29] <Ankabout> johnkpaul, it's just that my script works on click, and I now need it to work on a different way as well
[06:54:37] <Twilo> shoky: ok, but why?
[06:54:49] <Lachezar> johnkpaul: Thank you. Reading.
[06:54:59] <johnkpaul> Lachezar: no problem
[06:55:05] <johnkpaul> Ankabout: what is the "it" that should work in a different way
[06:55:16] <johnkpaul> if everything is just a normal event handler, .click() will work
[06:55:19] <johnkpaul> or .trigger("click")
[06:55:25] <johnkpaul> which is better, IMHO, because it is more explicit
[06:55:29] <Ankabout> johnkpaul http://jsfiddle.net/ankabout/uEySB/
[06:55:42] <johnkpaul> if the "it" is something like opening a file input dialog, or clicking on a anchor tag, you can't use .trigger("click")
[06:55:50] <Ankabout> that's a simplified version for jfiddle, but that's the general idea
[06:56:21] <johnkpaul> Ankabout: I don't see what you're tring to do
[06:56:23] <shoky> Twilo: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CCSQp/9/
[06:56:25] <johnkpaul> where is the simulated click?
[06:56:41] <Ankabout> right now the paragraphs animate when you click a menu link
[06:57:06] <Ankabout> I want to animate the page if the anchor in the URL is different, so I can link directly to a certain menu item
[06:57:30] <Ankabout> hmm but wait... it doesn't have to animate...
[06:57:32] <Ankabout> nevermind :)
[06:57:38] <Ankabout> thanks, you helped me figure it out
[06:57:44] <shoky> Twilo: and now it also keeps the newlines: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CCSQp/10/
[06:57:50] <johnkpaul> :) ok, no probelm
[06:58:25] <Twilo> shoky: ok
[06:58:27] <wild_oscar>  I'm looking for an eye tooltip/popup element that can be populated with contents taken from an ajax call. ie, user clicks "more info" and the info is retrieved and shown in a box, which can be manually closed. any suggestions on what to use?
[06:58:55] <jedimind> yes, jquery is a good tool for that
[06:58:59] * jedimind ducks
[06:59:44] <Xotix> if i have an iframe with a differnet domain loaded i can't access its content right?
[06:59:46] <Famic> how can we scroll t he page to a given offset ?
[07:00:07] <shoky> ?scrollTop
[07:00:08] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[07:00:17] <shoky> get/set
[07:00:23] <johnkpaul> Xotix: yes, that is correct
[07:00:33] <johnkpaul> not domain offiically, but origin
[07:00:34] <johnkpaul> ?sop
[07:00:35] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[07:00:38] <Xotix> but i can use postMessage?
[07:00:42] <johnkpaul> ^^ @ Xotix
[07:00:45] <johnkpaul> yes
[07:00:49] <rethus> whats the best way to check if empty select-fields or input fields in a form appear ? http://jsfiddle.net/suther/LAQ9F/9/
[07:00:52] <Xotix> ok i'll test that
[07:00:53] <Xotix> thx
[07:01:40] <Famic> shoky: what about animating to it ?
[07:01:52] <shoky> Famic: you can .animate() the scrollTop
[07:02:56] <Famic> shoky: how would you do that ?
[07:03:23] <Famic> I tried $('window').animate({scrollTop:value},2000,'easeInOutCubic'); I get an error
[07:04:03] <Hippie_> what method do I use to check if user isnt focused on a textarea anymore?
[07:04:48] <Twilo> shoky: sorry for the inconvenience, why does the onclick handler not appended?
[07:04:52] <Famic> Hippie_: I guess you want .blur()
[07:04:56] <Twilo> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/CCSQp/11/
[07:06:33] <shoky> Famic: try $('body')
[07:07:07] <Famic> shoky: same thing : f.easing[i.animatedProperties[this.prop]] is not a function
[07:07:19] <Famic> I tried window, html and body
[07:07:24] <shoky> did you include jquery ui?
[07:07:44] <Famic> nope
[07:07:52] <shoky> looks like you're missing the easing functions
[07:08:39] <batterhead> is jsfiddle down or is it just me?
[07:08:50] <shoky> just u
[07:09:17] <Famic> shoky: without easing there is no error but it doesn't work either
[07:09:42] <shoky> Famic: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/PyE8g/
[07:10:00] <shoky> Famic: http://css-tricks.com/examples/SmoothPageScroll/
[07:10:22] <Famic> shoky: thanks
[07:10:54] <shoky> Twilo: the jquery object doesn't store the HTML (afaik), it stores DOM elements (javascript objects)
[07:11:11] <Xotix> changing the windows.domaine (or was it document.domain?) to a different one causes that i can't set it back to the origin one, right? why?
[07:11:14] <Twilo> shoky: ah ok
[07:11:14] <shoky> Twilo: just parse the HTML textually
[07:11:20] <shoky> if you really must
[07:13:38] <diverdude> rethus: hmmm it tries to load mycontentflow.css which does not exist. There is however a mycontentflow.css.example. Is it that file it wants or what?

[07:14:45] <karelbarel> hello all, i would like to check whether result of: var $div = $('div#div_id');  is "empty" but unfortunately i don't know how to do it. I tried if ($div <> null) {...} but it did not work for me, could somebody give me a hint how to do it please?
[07:15:36] <Hippie_> why wouldnt $("#country").change(function() { alert('boom'); }); work?
[07:15:39] <rethus> diverdude: what you talking about? CoverFlow-plugin

[07:17:54] <svenjacobs> I am trying to use a BASE tag to point my website to a particular directory, and I have JQUERY POSTS that call a particular file - in Firefox and Chrome, the website takes into consideration the BASE tag preceding, but in IE, it doesn't...
[07:18:04] <svenjacobs> does anyone know if this is typical or may I just be screwing things up?
[07:18:33] <rethus> diverdude: for me it works quite well... maybe see the clean and easy documentation on the page
[07:18:45] <rethus> normaly it's setup within 10 minutes
[07:19:40] <rethus> you didn't need contentflow
[07:19:50] <rethus> i mean the mycontentFlow.css
[07:21:09] <diverdude> rethus: but if i dont rename mycontentflow.css.example to mycontentflow.css, it tries to load mycontentflow.css...and gets an error
[07:21:21] <rethus> so rename it
[07:21:31] <Xotix> how do i get the content of an iframe which has a different domain loaded?
[07:21:42] <diverdude> rethus: just find it strange
[07:22:14] <rethus> it's not my plugin, and i only use it onced.. but it have done his job realy great
[07:22:31] <rethus> many things in the world are realy strange... but work ;)
[07:22:42] <diverdude> rethus: where do you use it?
[07:22:53] <rethus> internal financial page
[07:23:15] <diverdude> rethus: so you use it for graphs?
[07:23:54] <rethus> for images (png and jpg)
[07:24:16] <diverdude> rethus: you use any of the add ons?
[07:29:10] <qvarkk> can someone please explain what "helper" is to me? http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#option-helper
[07:29:13] <lupian> rethus : i solved that problem! Thank you ! :D
[07:29:17] <Ar-ras> I appended few elements, but when i try to select them, they are not selected

[07:29:53] <rethus> diverdude: yes, "white"
[07:32:08] <VadtecWk> I am biding to the click event of a submit button for a form, is there any way to make the click event not fire until a $.post() has returned? I've tried using .preventDefault() on the click event and then manually firing the .submit() using a timer, but when the .submit fires, its not actually saving the form for some reason
[07:34:13] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk:  i dont think so
[07:34:25] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk: post is a asynchronous call
[07:34:55] <diverdude> rethus: hmm it feels kinda jumpy when dragging the slider dont you think?
[07:35:02] <VadtecWk> Ar-ras: right, though i know this particular post will return within 1000ms, so my timeout is set at 1500ms
[07:35:11] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk: thats not good
[07:35:21] <VadtecWk> im just trying to figure out why the hell its not submitting the form
[07:35:34] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk: well you return false
[07:36:02] <VadtecWk> Ar-ras: actually, no, it doesnt return false, i return true on purpose
[07:36:25] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk: maybe the post request is aborted on page reload
[07:36:37] <VadtecWk> Ar-ras: thats what im leaning towards
[07:36:54] <VadtecWk> hence the use of the timer delay for form submission
[07:37:37] <diverdude> rethus: the problem is if there are few images
[07:37:46] <diverdude> rethus: as if the slider is to rigid
[07:37:53] <rethus> how can i validate my dynamic forms ? http://jsfiddle.net/suther/LAQ9F/11/
[07:38:05] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk: maybe you should use different approach
[07:38:13] <bambams> Anybody know of a plugin that allows radio buttons to be deselected? :\
[07:38:27] <GamrGrl> I have a question about the jQuery function jQuery.get().   Due to a Custom CMS for a client of mine, I'm forced to write JS to an external JS and include it into the template.   Because of this, the jQuery.get() call is in an external file.   The URL that is requested... If I don't specify a domain name and use a relative URL, is it relative to the page that loaded the script (Webpage), or...
[07:38:29] <GamrGrl> ...the location of the JS file that called it?
[07:38:54] <VadtecWk> Ar-ras: i really wish i could...*** really really really *** wish i could, sadly, I cannot because it would take an entire re-write of this app, and I dont have that kind of time
[07:39:36] <[1]Bram> Good morning. We are developing our next big website project with jquery as JS framework. I'm looking for a good lightweight lightbox plugin which is actively maintained and have options for various types of media (images, inline html, youtube etc.). There are hundred thousand different implementations on the internet. Could someone point me in the right direction?
[07:40:05] <rethus> ?lighbox
[07:40:10] <bot-t> rethus, plugins.jquery.com - We've been looking to provide a higher-quality, spam-free experience at the plugins site for some time, and a major error on our part forced us to shut down the current site before we could put the... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/lighbox
[07:40:40] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk: than ask for more mone
[07:40:40] <Ar-ras> y
[07:40:56] <bambams> GamrGrl: jQuery(<selector>, [ <document> ]); // Does that help?
[07:41:05] <[1]Bram> rethus, lightbox is just for images
[07:41:17] <rethus> i know, i only call the bot
[07:41:18] <VadtecWk> Ar-ras: lol...doesnt work that way on this project
[07:41:19] <rethus> ?bot
[07:41:19] <bot-t> ?bot-t
[07:41:25] <VadtecWk> i wish... lol
[07:41:28] <rethus> whats your name ?bot
[07:41:46] <rethus> ?bot
[07:41:46] <bot-t> ?bot-t
[07:41:59] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk: well i would send that post, wait till it comes back, sent form serialized per ajax and get result as json (e.g. result=true) and redirect to new page
[07:42:17] <rethus> how can i validate my dynamic forms ? http://jsfiddle.net/suther/LAQ9F/11/
[07:42:55] <VadtecWk> Ar-ras: i would use a similar approach if i had the time to redesign this app, i just need to do some extra accounting when the button is clicked, and for whatever reason, i can only get it to work 50% right now
[07:43:09] <GamrGrl> bambams: Uhh.. no. Not really...  Example:  Page is here:  http://domain.com/     JS is stored here:   http://securecontent.domain.com/file.js         File.js has a request to:   http://securecontent.domain.com/openme.txt      If a page on domain.com loads the file.JS file,  the jQuery.get() url...  Is it relative to the JS file, or the page?  I thin I figured out the answer, though, when...
[07:43:11] <VadtecWk> ill keep bashing on it and either declare it fubar or fix it
[07:43:11] <GamrGrl> ...jQuery returned the entire domain.com page...
[07:44:08] <diverdude> rethus: rason i found it strange is that on the documentation page: http://www.jacksasylum.eu/ContentFlow/docu.php its says nothing about renaming the mycontentflow.css.example file
[07:44:08] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk:  how about writing function for submit
[07:44:15] <diverdude> rethus: rason = reason
[07:44:27] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk: than you give parameter which says sent post or sent form
[07:44:42] <GamrGrl> So... then I need to change my question.  Due to the file needing to be on a different server than the page I'm working on, is there a way to load a TXT file from a different domain for parsing? ... I hate custom CMS'.
[07:44:54] <VadtecWk> Ar-ras: i think id rather just take a big hammer to it ;)
[07:45:00] <rethus> diverdude: so send the developers an email, of fill a bug-report... somebody code, and other ones make software better with the response they give
[07:45:07] <VadtecWk> ill figure it out, still tracing some of the other JS on the page
[07:45:12] <VadtecWk> making sure its not getting in the way
[07:45:40] <Ar-ras> VadtecWk: when form is submittted it doesdo post, and in post success you do form submit but with parameter that says no post, directly sent form
[07:46:08] <Hookah> i have $('select'), i want to know t he amount of options t his <select> has. how do i go about doing this?
[07:46:57] <GamrGrl> bambams:  Oop I read that wrong.  I'm looking into that now
[07:48:30] <Ar-ras> Hookah: http://www.electrictoolbox.com/jquery-count-select-options/ 5 sec of google
[07:49:15] <rethus> in which way does this jquery-ui-form comes to "novalidate" ? http://jsfiddle.net/suther/LAQ9F/12/
[07:50:33] <Ar-ras> rethus: maybe you should quit your job and let real programmers do it
[07:53:25] <arnpro> why does jQuery API specifically says not to bind to beforeunload, and instead should bind directly to the window.onbeforeunload??? according to 2nd answer in: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1889404/jquery-ui-dialog-onbeforeunload
[07:53:31] <rethus> Ar-ras: k, show how you would solve it, if you are a real one ;)
[07:55:56] <Ar-ras> rethus: give me money and i do it.. if no money than ask for help but not for solving your whole projec
[07:55:57] <Ar-ras> t
[07:56:54] <GamrGrl> Yeah, no... jQuery(<selector>, [ <document> ]);   Does not help what I need at all...  I need to call an external file, not find something on the inside of the current document.
[07:56:58] <rethus> i ask for help and you answer with nonsense
[07:58:42] <austinallen> Wow Ar-ras we ARE the real programmers
[08:00:15] <Ar-ras> austinallen: idk about you... but yeah. the thing is... rhetus posts a shitload in jsfiddle and asks something we cant see iimmediatly in that code
[08:00:42] <Ar-ras> so rethus what is your specific question? debugging your whole form for you?
[08:00:54] <smykes> Is there a special javascript way to make a certain DIV not use a certain style sheet?
[08:01:54] <austinallen> removeClass() smykes?
[08:02:00] <rethus>  form works quite well, only try to add validation to it.
[08:02:20] <Ar-ras> rethus: do you use something like jquery.validate?
[08:02:30] <rethus> yes
[08:02:34] <austinallen> i use Plain javascript for form validation mostly
[08:03:54] <diverdude> rethus: do you know how to instruct the contentflow to just use the natural size of the images and not stretch them?
[08:03:59] <Ar-ras> i usually make most validation on serverside.... less pain in the ass
[08:04:56] <austinallen> Yeah, but i only use Client Side Validation when i want to give feedback to the user without a refresh or for the data to be sent to the server
[08:05:34] <austinallen> I don't use javascript as much as i thought i would have when i learned it a while back...
[08:05:36] <xckpd7> question: can anyone look at this and tell me what I'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/rYEe2/ short piece of code
[08:06:15] <austinallen> What exactly are you aiming at doing member:xckpd7?
[08:06:24] <xckpd7> I'm trying to truncate words & show a more link... but I'm dropping 1 word when I do it... if you look in the html, THISWORDMISSING is gone
[08:07:26] <xckpd7> if you look at the link... I'm trying to truncate at a certain amount of words
[08:07:38] <austinallen> Yeah.
[08:07:38] <xckpd7> or characters
[08:08:04] <shoky> xckpd7: you're splitting the text in the middle of the word
[08:08:26] <diverdude> rethus: nvm
[08:08:39] <Ar-ras> i removed the whitespace
[08:08:47] <Ar-ras> and it works ? xckpd7
[08:09:00] <xckpd7> shoky: if you add an extra letter to (penatibus), you'll see it then works
[08:09:25] <Ar-ras> xckpd7: how about trimming whitespace before checking length etc.
[08:09:33] <xckpd7> shoky: there is a certain bounds at which it doesn't work correctly... just looking for a proper method because
[08:10:12] <xckpd7> Ar-ras: don't follow you. my code will work !if! the character limit doesn't cut the word in half
[08:10:16] <Ar-ras> http://jsfiddle.net/rYEe2/1/
[08:10:22] <xckpd7> my code assumes it will be cut
[08:10:26] <atula> if anyone is on Hacker News, I would love some comments/suggestions/upvote: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3924028 thank you.
[08:10:32] <shoky> xckpd7: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/rYEe2/2/
[08:10:41] <shoky> xckpd7 you're cutting the missing word
[08:10:45] <shoky> with the .substr()
[08:11:27] <Ar-ras> i thought your word is missing should be visible
[08:11:45] <shoky> (change it to showChar++ to bring penatibu back
[08:11:46] <shoky> )
[08:12:07] <Ar-ras> xckpd7: http://jsfiddle.net/rYEe2/1/ <-- so with trim it is showing
[08:12:14] <xckpd7> Ar-ras: http://jsfiddle.net/rYEe2/3/
[08:12:29] <BillCriswell> Can you guys think of a way to basically mimic this in an easily updatable way? http://www.fleetsafety.com/outfit-dodge-charger-front
[08:12:31] <xckpd7> Ar-ras: when the content changes, it still cuts off 1 word
[08:12:50] <BillCriswell> He didn't like my original idea, which was http://www.fleetsafety.com/servlet/-strse-template/outfit/Page?tsetlock=store_version3&vehicle=Charger :-/
[08:13:47] <Ar-ras> sry mate, g2g back to my work, found my solution 30 min ago :D
[08:13:52] <xckpd7> shoky: is the link you posted cuts off the word 'penatibu'
[08:14:02] <shoky> xckpd7: <shoky> (change it to showChar++ to bring penatibu back
[08:14:36] <shoky> oh

[08:30:16] <rethus> austinallen: so how would you check, if selectbox has a value?
[08:30:16] <rethus> $("select option:selected).each(function(){ this.val()} ?
[08:31:12] <arnpro> does re-binding event on an element brings perfomance issues?
[08:31:18] <atrigent> is there a way to check whether an event handler, such as a delegation, has been added to an element?
[08:31:33] <nickelnick> http://pastie.org/3854357 - how come my click only gets picked up twice..once for open once for close
[08:31:34] <atrigent> like .hasDelegation(selector, event) or something like that
[08:31:35] <austinallen> i usually would do an if-else statement
[08:31:36] <nickelnick> or more/less
[08:31:45] <dpy> hi guys
[08:32:21] <nickelnick> i feel like i need to unbind/rebind or something
[08:32:24] <dpy> does anyone see why clicking on this SVG image (embedded using the embed-tag) doesn't show the popup/alert?   http://jsbin.com/acuwof
[08:33:00] <arnpro> atrigent: im sort of asking same as you, see if this helps you (1st answer): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6361465/how-to-check-if-click-event-is-already-bound-jquery
[08:33:43] <atrigent> arnpro: thanks!
[08:40:20] <dpy> nm, the embed-tag doesn't seem to support events in chrome and FF (while it should according to the standards), fixed by using a plain div with the SVG as bg img.

[08:44:04] <diverdude> rethus: did you use the ContentFlowGlobal.setAddOnConf ?
[08:44:47] <rethus> diverdude: i use only the naked plain code... with white-plugin
[08:47:00] <ThrushAAX_> nickelnick: I think you are fogetting to remove the fullBio class in the if statement...
[08:47:27] <GamrGrl> Grrrr.... Why do Wysiwyg editors even run my javascript.  .... I can't make this easy for anyone to edit.
[08:49:03] <silverwind> GamrGrl, The question is "why do you use a wysiwyg editor?"
[08:49:46] <GamrGrl> silverwind: My client's forced to use a company CMS.  It's wysiwyg, period.  Editing the source literally edit's the source as the browser writes it.
[08:50:10] <silverwind> GamrGrl :(
[08:50:46] <GamrGrl> silverwind: Because of that, I cannot paste Javascript code in, and I'm forced to use external JS calling. It's not so bad.  But, the wysiwyg runs it anyway... and one of my script deletes the contents of a DIV ... which is needed in the wysiwyg.
[08:53:24] <GamrGrl> My client wants a mini slideshow of text, basically... like random quotes. It will scroll the panels out and in.  No biggie on a regular server...  I make a text file, import it with jQuery, and parse and do whatever... But on this server, all uploaded files are stored on a separate server for content.
[08:53:29] <silverwind> GamrGrl, That's a very strange CMS :/ It doesn't make it easy to add JS :/
[08:54:53] <GamrGrl> Images, Txt, Documents, etc... They're all stored offsite.  I can call JS and other awesomes from there.  Except my client is NOT 'technically inclined'.  Senior gentleman.  He needs to be able to either edit things through the wysiwyg or edit a text file.    I can't do the text file option, as the JS that runs runs it within the webpage's domain. But it needs to get the TXT file off of the...
[08:54:55] <GamrGrl> ...content domain.  Big no no. Not allowed cross domain loading.
[08:55:28] * GamrGrl bangs head.
[08:55:37] <silverwind> I can't see any way around this :/
[08:56:39] <GamrGrl> Neither can I....   Rfhg... I hate custom business CMS'... This one's on .NET, too.  So no special goodie scripts either.
[08:58:31] <GamrGrl> Ooo... Maybe I got an idea... The WYSIWYG runs inside an ID named text area... I could use JS to see if that ID exists, and if so, avoid running my script.
[09:08:06] <GamrGrl> Bloody wysiwyg is called through a script after my code runs.  Rgh.. Hmm...
[09:09:04] <scriv> Hey guys, a question: I'm working with a django based CMS. One of the forms has a dropdown field. I was wondering how I would access the choice selected from the dropdown through jquery.
[09:10:27] <scriv> I tried $("id_fieldname").length but it always returns 0, regardless of choice.
[09:14:04] <Mohsen_Hassani> How can I iterate over this JSON? {1: [item, item1],6: [item2- item]}
[09:14:05] <GamrGrl> YES!!!  I got it!!!!  *dances*  I checked to see if the page the script is being run on is in a frame or not.  The WYSiWYG was in a frame... So it won't run code if it's in a frame, but it will when it's not!  YAYAYAAYA!  *falls over*
[09:14:46] * jedimind picks GamrGrl up and dusts 'em off
[09:14:49] <jedimind> you should be more careful
[09:15:29] * GamrGrl shrugs, "I'm glad I got this done.  Took me 3 hours to figure out.... It should NOT have taken that long.  I'm just glad... I thought I was going to have to give up."
[09:18:10] <xckpd7> question: I figued out how to truncate text in an element... but turns out there will probably be multiple elements inside the element that I want to truncate. So imagine 6 <p /> elements in a div. I'm trying to truncate based on word count, unfortunately it looks like it sometimes leaves elements unclosed?
[09:18:48] <diverdude> Are there any neat html5 tricks for creating custom upload buttons or is it still the same difficult hairy stuff as it always was?
[09:19:07] <xckpd7> so if I truncate by 50 words and I'm in the middle of a paragraph, it doesn't work out. how would I truncate but take properly closing elements into account?
[09:22:56] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: It'll be way easier to strip the HTML out.
[09:24:42] <GamrGrl> diverdude>  http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_button.asp
[09:29:10] <smykes> Is there a way to eliminate a style sheet being used for a certain <div> if the stylesheet is included in the header?
[09:30:52] <DanGer> awau
[09:31:44] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: sure but the field I'm rendering is from a rich text editor... so I'm trying to make a compromise (like if there is more than 1 element, just strip all remaining elements)
[09:32:01] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: if there is only 1 element, strip it to 50
[09:33:56] <scriv> Question: Is there something about django fieldsets that stops jquery from being able to apply hide and show to elements in the fieldset?
[09:34:11] <juha_> bot-t: tell coldhead i said hi
[09:34:12] <bot-t> juha_, Okay.
[09:35:23] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: Not sure I'm following you there.
[09:36:39] <diverdude> GamrGrl: hehe i know about html buttons ;)
[09:36:50] <diverdude> GamrGrl: already
[09:37:17] <GamrGrl> diverdude:  No worries, I was more meaning for you to see the HTML5 section of it.    That page has HTML5 content so you can see if there were any neat stuffs.
[09:37:55] <diverdude> GamrGrl: but for file uploads its harder
[09:38:21] <GamrGrl> Yeah, the upload button is browser indipendant.  Can't control it's look
[09:39:07] <rethus> how can i get the encapsulating div with class FilterRows from a function each.. to option:selected?
[09:39:22] <rethus> parent(".filterRows") ?
[09:45:37] <smykes> do the contents of an iframe take on the styles of the page it is embeded in?
[09:46:43] <johnkpaul> smykes: no
[09:46:54] <smykes> that is a good thing
[09:46:56] <smykes> thank you

[10:18:06] <skylamer`> u have to put apreventDefault()
[10:19:06] <diverdude> skylamer`: here is a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rWHCf/

[10:23:01] <brettster> hey guys

[10:25:36] <yango> hi. I'm using datatables with keytable and jeditable. The behavior I'm seeing is that when jeditable is triggered (and the input form appears) and I press <tab>, keytable captures it and finishes jeditable, BUT (and here's the thing I want to debug) the focus ends being OUT of the table. I see that keytable uses stopPropagation and preventDefault, so I'm not sure how to proceed to debug this problem
[10:25:53] <brettster> eh
[10:25:59] <brettster> it was because i was using id's
[10:26:01] <brettster> and not classes
[10:27:35] <yango> Another relevant thing is that keytable by itself works okay, so it's the interaction between jeditable and keytable
[10:27:50] <yango> is there a way to see the ordering of events and why could this be happening?
[10:28:57] <Voziv> Is the jquery ui spinner only available in 1.9? If so how stable is 1.9 to use with production applications?

[11:26:47] <johnkpaul> Famic: there are only two by default, they're listed in the animate docs
[11:26:57] <johnkpaul> linear and swing
[11:27:00] <johnkpaul> @animate @Famic
[11:27:21] <johnkpaul> ?animate @Famic

[11:28:35] <Famic> johnkpaul: what about jqueryui then? is there a list/demo page ?
[11:28:39] <johnkpaul> m0dmd: this.id

[11:31:48] <Famic> johnkpaul: what parts of jqueryui would I need at minima to have those available ?
[11:33:17] <BobSermon> Hii, I'm getting Origin  is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin, i googled it and they are telling me that i use a source that isn't on my domain put the ajax call is on the same url as my domain so i don't get the error someone that can help
[11:34:30] <johnkpaul> m0dmd: :) I know what you mean, but it's all just javascript under the hood
[11:34:43] <johnkpaul> Famic: I don't actually know, I bet you can choose easings in their download builder
[11:35:00] <m0dmd> When we drive nice cars like jQuery, we don't bother to look under the hood
[11:35:02] <johnkpaul> BobSermon: same URL meaning what?
[11:35:03] <m0dmd> LOL
[11:35:04] <johnkpaul> ?sop @BobSermon
[11:35:04] <bot-t> BobSermon, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[11:35:26] <johnkpaul> m0dmd: but when you do look under the hood, you get a lot of appreciation for it

[11:35:53] <iamjarvo> so this is more or a debug js question. in firebug it shows me the ajax request under console. where does it do it in chrome?
[11:35:53] <tomasm-> hi, is there any way I can safely open a dialog/modal from the https version of the site while still on the http version of the site? I know cross-domain ajax isn't supported, but what about loading a secure ajax dialog from a non-secure page?
[11:36:26] <iamjarvo> network xhr?
[11:37:17] <BobSermon> johnkpaul: my page is on http://sermonbob.be/home and the ajax call is to: http://www.sermonbob.be/contact/sendMail so it will never work?
[11:37:20] <johnkpaul> iamjarvo: network tab
[11:37:35] <johnkpaul> BobSermon: it will not work unless you setup cross origin resource sharing
[11:37:36] <johnkpaul> or jsonp
[11:37:40] <johnkpaul> why not just redirect to www/?
[11:37:58] <johnkpaul> tomasm-: you mean using an iframe?
[11:39:38] <jtoy>  I have jQuery.ajaxSetup({ 'beforeSend': function(xhr) { xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", "text/javascript") } })  but rails and jquery are unable to communicate still,  rails sends the data but jquery doesn't get anything back
[11:39:40] <jonathancutrell> is Paul Irish around? Sneaky guy
[11:39:55] <jtoy> is  there anything else I'm supposed to do?
[11:40:00] <jtoy> this is driving me crazy
[11:40:09] <tomasm-> johnkpaul, no this is an ajax call.... but im guessing the only way that will work is via iframes (not really an option)
[11:40:23] <BobSermon> johnkpaul: how to setup that sharing?
[11:40:30] <m0dmd> lol this is like jquery's query
[11:40:34] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: got a weird CSS related issue in Safari, was gonna see if you would take a look.
[11:40:52] <jedimind_> jonathancutrell, #css is probably better for that
[11:41:04] <jonathancutrell> jedimind_: Thanks, I appreciate the suggestion
[11:41:29] <johnkpaul> tomasm-: the only straightforward way would be using an iframe, yes
[11:41:34] <jtoy> anyone
[11:41:43] <johnkpaul> tomasm-:  and BobSermon, if you really need to communicate across domains, you need to use cross origin resource sharing, which you can google for
[11:41:50] <johnkpaul> or jsonp, which you should also google for
[11:42:22] <johnkpaul> jtoy: what do you mean rails sends the data?
[11:42:22] <BobSermon> johnkpaul: what do you preffer?
[11:42:29] <johnkpaul> BobSermon: if I were you, I'd redirect to www
[11:42:54] <jtoy> johnkpaul: in my rails logs, it shows the request was received and successfully called
[11:43:37] <raj> does doing .show() remove a 'hidden' class if it exists?
[11:43:42] <BobSermon> johnkpaul: the thing is as i use just www the url he makes is : http://sermonbob.be/www.sermonbob.be/contact/sendMail 404 (Not Found)
[11:44:46] <johnkpaul> jtoy: you say the request was recieved and that rails sends the data, can you see that in your network tab or firebug?
[11:45:00] <Trisox> raj:  no it uses css styling
[11:45:19] <johnkpaul> BobSermon: no, I said redirect
[11:45:37] <raj> so if I want an element hidden on page load, I usually add .hidden onto it, and have .hidden{display:none;} in my css
[11:45:38] <Trisox> it can change css use firebug or what ever to inspect ;)
[11:45:50] <raj> should I not then use .show()/.hide() for that element?
[11:45:50] <jtoy> johnkpaul: yes, i see the data
[11:45:57] <jtoy> from chrome's inspector
[11:46:10] <BobSermon> johnkpaul: its funny why a stupid ajax contact form does that stupid things :s
[11:46:13] <Trisox> yes but the .show changes the display
[11:46:13] <jtoy> but query doesn't accept it
[11:46:14] <Trisox> :)
[11:46:14] <jtoy> jquery
[11:46:20] <raj> Trisox, yeah
[11:46:23] <Trisox> the class stays the same
[11:46:25] <raj> but the .hidden is still on the element
[11:46:30] <Trisox> yes
[11:46:34] <raj> which seems messy
[11:46:43] <Trisox> else removeClass ;)
[11:46:45] <raj> should I just play with the hidden class instead of using .show()/.hide()
[11:46:45] <raj> ?
[11:46:49] <Trisox> ?removeclass
[11:46:49] <bot-t> .removeClass([className]): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[11:46:53] <Trisox> no
[11:46:55] <raj> i know what removeClass is
[11:47:15] <raj> just always removeClass
[11:47:16] <raj> k
[11:47:19] <Trisox> no
[11:47:25] <raj> oh, then?
[11:47:37] <Trisox> use show hide you dont need the class if you dont want the element to be hidden at dom ready
[11:47:57] <johnkpaul> ?demo @jtoy
[11:47:58] <bot-t> jtoy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:48:19] <Trisox> calling .hide on ready is messy use css for that
[11:48:29] <raj> Trisox, I want the element hidden at dom ready
[11:48:34] <raj> that's why the class is there
[11:48:51] <Trisox> well thats the way to go then
[11:48:57] <raj> what is?
[11:49:02] <Trisox> like you do now
[11:49:16] <raj> and removeClass() anytime I do .show() ?
[11:49:23] <jtoy> johnkpaul: I'm 95% sure its the headers, is there a way i can see from chrome the hedaders set?
[11:49:30] <Trisox> no just show
[11:49:31] <johnkpaul> yes, in the network tab
[11:49:39] <Trisox> what you got now is good
[11:49:40] <raj> Trisox, but then .hidden is still on the element
[11:49:48] <raj> just thought it seemed messy
[11:49:52] <raj> but if that's kosher, ok
[11:49:59] <Trisox> sure wy not
[11:50:16] <jtoy> it says text/javascript
[11:50:37] <jtoy> johnkpaul: is there a way i can confirm jquery is setup properly to receive it?
[11:51:05] <johnkpaul> oh, so you're trying to send javascript through an ajax call?
[11:51:07] <johnkpaul> to be executed?
[11:51:08] <Trisox> raj: using css chaining is not messy either ;) class="niceroundborder hidden" is proper
[11:51:21] <johnkpaul> what is your datatype, jtoy, it should be "Script"
[11:51:23] <Trisox> ?ajax success
[11:51:24] <bot-t> Trisox, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:52:02] <Trisox> if you want to load javascript try require js
[11:52:04] <jtoy> johnkpaul:  it should be "text/javascript"
[11:52:12] <jtoy> johnkpaul:  shouldn't this print out wtf:  jQuery.ajaxSetup({ 'beforeSend': function(xhr) { xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", "text/javascript");  alert('wtf'); } });   it doesnt
[11:52:19] <Trisox> http://requirejs.org/
[11:52:25] <abjorn> text/jaboscripts
[11:52:26] <johnkpaul> jtoy: by itself, no, that should not print out anything
[11:52:33] <johnkpaul> or rather, that should not alert anything
[11:52:34] <Trisox> jtoy:
[11:52:56] <johnkpaul> Trisox: or, for a one off smaller solution, you can use getScript
[11:53:04] <Trisox> yes true
[11:54:19] <jtoy> johnkpaul: so how can I know its set properly then?  and why doesn't that do the popup?
[11:54:26] <Famic> I am handling the scroll to an anchor manually and returning false so that the default scrollTop doesn't happen. Is there a way to still have the url change ?
[11:54:41] <johnkpaul> jtoy: ajaxSetup just sets up some properties that will be used in subsequent ajax calls
[11:54:46] <johnkpaul> it doesn't perform any ajax calls
[11:55:04] <jtoy> oh, i thought it calls that every time before the ajax call is sent
[11:55:12] <Trisox> Famic: e.preventDefault
[11:55:21] <Trisox> ?preventDefault
[11:55:22] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:55:34] <johnkpaul> jtoy: beforeSend _is_ called before subsequent ajax calls
[11:55:42] <johnkpaul> but that line of code that you sent, doesnt' cause any ajax call to happen
[11:56:20] <jtoy> johnkpaul: yes, i have the ajax working already, the call goes through, when i click my ajax link, it should then print wtf?
[11:56:25] <Famic> Trisox: that stops the default scrollTop but the url doesn't get updated
[11:57:05] <johnkpaul> yes jtoy, it should
[11:57:08] <Trisox> mmm ?paste
[11:57:19] <jtoy> so then something is broken, :(
[11:57:56] <jtoy> hmm, ok calls wtf now
[11:58:13] <omnipotent1_> is there a way to test :hidden ignoring parents?
[11:58:32] <Famic> Trisox: http://demo.lindicible.com/lusine/
[11:58:43] <Famic> you gotta scroll a bit to see the menu
[11:58:49] <jtoy> it still does not display the data even though it is text/javascript
[11:59:02] <Trisox> oee fancy
[11:59:02] <Trisox> :D
[11:59:13] <jtoy> johnkpaul: do i need to modify my ajax call:   $.get('/lists/new', {twitter_user_id : twitterUserId},function(data){  alert(data); }     ?
[11:59:46] <johnkpaul> jtoy: add an error handler, and check if tat is being called
[11:59:52] <johnkpaul> and if that is being called, check the error message
[11:59:56] <Trisox> let me check
[12:03:00] <jtoy> johnkpaul: there is an error:  .error(function(d) { alert(d); });  -> object object
[12:03:13] <johnkpaul> jtoy: console.log(d) not alert
[12:04:25] <jtoy> johnkpaul: it seems fine
[12:04:48] <jtoy> johnkpaul: statusText: "OK"    ,   responseText is the html
[12:05:18] <Xotix> hi
[12:05:55] <jtoy> hmm, not  quite sure what is wrong, the data is in the error
[12:05:57] <Xotix> i'm trying to post to a iframe http://pastebin.com/BLGT9SAz why does this not work? the form doesn't care about the target.
[12:06:05] <jtoy> i don't actually know what the issue is
[12:06:05] <johnkpaul> jtoy: it's html?
[12:06:11] <johnkpaul> the responseText should be javascript
[12:06:36] <jtoy> johnkpaul:  it can't be html?   i want to the ajax call to just get html
[12:07:04] <johnkpaul> jtoy: but you went through all of that trouble to set that you accept javascript
[12:07:33] <jtoy> is that the actual issue though?  that is the standard way to do it in rails/jquery land i thought
[12:08:57] <johnkpaul> jtoy: can you remove your ajaxsetup code
[12:08:59] <johnkpaul> and try
[12:09:21] <Woet> Xotix: iframes have been EOL for 20 years, please try again
[12:09:40] <Xotix> woet eol? this is a common hack.
[12:10:01] <Woet> Xotix: a common hack to do what exactly?
[12:10:12] <New0> hi everyone, how can i create a JS funciton that control a flash var in AS3?
[12:10:28] <jtoy> johnkpaul: same issue
[12:10:36] <Trisox> Famic:  no idea :S
[12:10:38] <Xotix> woet, pseudo ajax cross domain file upload
[12:11:08] <Famic> Trisox: is it supposed to work as described ?
[12:11:18] <Woet> Xotix: cross domain file upload? what?
[12:12:06] <Trisox> i was thinking     window.location = $(this).attr('href');`
[12:12:25] <Trisox> but that makes it even scroll when return false used
[12:12:26] <Trisox> hehe
[12:12:27] <Xotix> woet yes. a cross domain file upload. from foo.bar.com to xxx.bar.com  ajax style but faked anyway why isn't it targeting my iframe?
[12:12:46] <Trisox> ajax upload doesnt work with old ie versions
[12:12:58] <magmento> Am I correct in saying that if I use .clone() to make a duplicate object that it will not respond to any events that are in place if its cloned after the page has finished loading?
[12:13:02] <jtoy> hmmmm
[12:13:13] <Xotix> Trisox i support ie8+ nothign else i dont care about ie7
[12:13:26] <Trisox> k lucky your
[12:13:33] <johnkpaul> Trisox: one of the arguments to the error handler is a message
[12:13:36] <johnkpaul> that describes the error
[12:13:39] <johnkpaul> sorry ^^ jtoy
[12:13:54] <johnkpaul> I don't rememer which parameter it is, but you can look at that to find out what the error is
[12:13:56] <Xotix> Trisox :P and anyway, this is not ajax because i'm using an iframe. it is a normal http post request. but somehow i don't get it working
[12:14:22] <Trisox> ?pupload
[12:14:23] <bot-t> Trisox, Having trouble with jQuery variable scope in an image upload plugin - http://wordpress.org/support/topic/having-trouble-with-jquary-variable-scope-in-an-image-upload-plugin
[12:14:26] <Trisox> oh
[12:14:48] <Trisox> i use mostly http://www.plupload.com/
[12:15:16] <Xotix> Trisox too fancy but thanks
[12:15:20] <Trisox> :)
[12:15:54] <jtoy> johnkpaul: parsererror
[12:16:03] <Trisox> ajax is also fancy wy not use <input type=file/>
[12:16:14] <Trisox> ;)
[12:17:37] <Trisox> Xotix: as long as you stay of applets brrr ;-)
[12:17:43] <Xotix> for normal ajax upload i recommend forms.jquery.js works perfectly but not cross domain like i'd need it
[12:17:53] <Trisox> :(
[12:18:17] <Trisox> wy crossdomain?
[12:19:20] <johnkpaul> jtoy: parse error implies that it is still being sent as javascript
[12:19:25] <johnkpaul> what is the response type
[12:19:29] <johnkpaul> from your rails app
[12:19:32] <johnkpaul> it should be text/html
[12:19:33] <Xotix> because i'm doing some image transformation and hosting service together with a jquery plugin to initialize the file input. the idea is to use that iframe hack together with CORS to be able to accees its content.
[12:19:37] <Xotix> Trisox
[12:20:37] <Trisox> mm goodluck i hate iframes :D
[12:20:41] <Trisox> brrr
[12:21:06] <Xotix> Trisox, shouldn't be that hard, have done some iframe posting before but atm i'm stuck and no body seems to know. :(
[12:21:51] <Trisox> cant you upload to your own domain then insert the url in to the iframe?
[12:22:06] <Trisox> dunno rambling something
[12:22:24] <johnkpaul> Xotix: this is how to "ajax" upload images?
[12:22:27] <Trisox> so you got an absolute image location to analyse
[12:22:35] <johnkpaul> Xotix: http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[12:22:40] <johnkpaul> I have used that very successfully in the past
[12:23:20] <silverwind> Most of the time, I use the jquery iframe transport plugin for that
[12:23:41] <tw2113> i just try to avoid iframes when i can
[12:23:42] <jtoy> johnkpaul: fixed
[12:24:00] <johnkpaul> jtoy: good, what did you change
[12:24:02] <Trisox> tw2113: mostly that
[12:24:03] <Trisox> :D
[12:24:04] <Xotix> johnkpaul i need it cross domain the plugins don't support this. forms.jquery.js is better (i liek it more) there you can set that is uses the iframe hack and the upload actualyl works but i rather want to do it my own if i have to use the iframe for every browser anyway. So, how do i target an iframe with an html form? :) but thanks
[12:24:16] <jtoy> dataType set to htm
[12:24:17] <jtoy> html
[12:24:23] <jtoy> what a waste of time :(
[12:24:28] <johnkpaul> ah, good jtoy
[12:24:32] <johnkpaul> at least you got it working
[12:24:40] <jtoy> johnkpaul: thanks, appreciate the help
[12:24:47] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun
[12:25:03] <Trisox> xotix from the iframe dom up?
[12:25:11] <johnkpaul> ?g form submit target @ Xotix
[12:25:12] <bot-t> Xotix, HTML form target Attribute - http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_target.asp
[12:25:15] <Trisox> like window.parent?
[12:25:30] <BillCriswell> Do you guys use HTML5 elements or just <div>'s on your sites? I love everything about HTML5 minus having to use an html5shim
[12:25:47] <Xotix> johnkpaul i've posted my html ( http://pastebin.com/BLGT9SAz ) this doesn't work.
[12:25:54] <brianloveswords> Ugh, why is bot-t linking to w3schools.
[12:26:06] <johnkpaul> ha, that's a good point, brianloveswords
[12:26:08] <Trisox> Xotix: this window.parent.$(window.parent.document).trigger('complete');
[12:26:13] <tw2113> i blame the government brianloveswords
[12:26:18] <Trisox> inside the iframe..
[12:26:23] <jstout24> if I have an input box and many other elements reference the value… what's the best way to change the value on every referencing element on form submit?
[12:26:26] <brianloveswords> It's _definitely_ an illuminati conspiracy.
[12:26:45] <Trisox> :>
[12:26:45] <jstout24> and keep in mind, I have about 15 pages and don't want to have to "custom" code it each time
[12:26:56] <Xotix> Trisox i can't access the iframes content because its cross domain. for that i need to enable cors. (an http header)
[12:27:07] <johnkpaul> ?g form submit target -w3schools.com
[12:27:09] <bot-t> johnkpaul, javascript - HTML form with two submit buttons and two "target ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/942772/html-form-with-two-submit-buttons-and-two-target-attributes
[12:27:14] <Xotix> anyway first i haveto get that target working...
[12:27:25] <johnkpaul> :(
[12:27:27] <johnkpaul> at least it's on topic
[12:28:35] <jstout24> not really though
[12:28:41] <Xotix> johnkpaul did you mean me? i've also read some stackoverflow about this but can't figure out any error. :( thx for the link
[12:29:01] <johnkpaul> Xotix: no, that was just a test to see how the bot treated -w3schools
[12:29:12] <jstout24> i can easily bind an action to a form's ajax submit then change the values everywhere else by handcoding the selectors
[12:29:18] <jstout24> but i want to centralize it
[12:29:26] <Xotix> johnkpaul ah :P
[12:29:27] <gweedo767> having a little problem, trying to get the offset of a div after another div has been slideDown()'ed
[12:29:39] <gweedo767> but the callback after slideDown is reporting their old positions for some reason
[12:29:40] <Trisox> Xotix: this suposely gives you iframe access parent.frames['frame_name'].document.getElementById('id').innerHTML = 'updated_value';
[12:30:22] <Trisox> i love to hear your final solution ;-) worth a blog post or something
[12:30:42] <Trisox> brb
[12:30:48] <Xotix> Trisox probably not because it's cross domain but thanks. Anyway, i need to get the upload working before i have to access it's content :) thx, it's some kind of exam will be published but in german.
[12:33:35] <magmento> Am I correct in saying that if I use .clone() to make a duplicate object that it will not respond to any events that are in place if its cloned after the page has finished loading?
[12:35:54] <gweedo767> $("#sidemarkAllContainer").load("/sidemarkall.php", {mode: 'view', items: items}, function() { $("#sidemarkAllContainer").slideDown("slow", "linear", function() {
[12:36:06] <gweedo767> doing that, but when I call $("#sidemarkAllContainer").height(), I get 0
[12:36:13] <gweedo767> even though there is definitly content in that div post the load()
[12:38:35] <ShooterMG> i'm using jeditable with a multiselect plugin. i'm having a problem with sending the selected values to the server. if i give the data the name "values", and select the values 1,2,3 and hit submit, the resulting php $_POST['values'] = 3 (the last value that was selected) instead of $_POST['values'] = '1,2,3' or something
[12:39:14] <ShooterMG> because the request looks something like ?values=1&values=2&values=3
[12:39:42] <ShooterMG> at least I think that's why
[12:40:19] <Trisox> Xotix: das ist oke
[12:40:28] <jtallis> Is it possible to combine these two: $("#chatMessage").val(""); $("#chatMessage").focus();
[12:40:28] <jtallis> ?
[12:40:35] <Xotix> ;)
[12:41:06] <|PiP|> if im using the jquery.validate plugin, how can i ensure all forms (current, future ones returned with ajax) validate as well?
[12:41:27] <Trisox> ich kann das ein klein bisschen
[12:41:39] <Trisox> <--dutch
[12:41:54] <Trisox> jtallis: chaining ;-)
[12:42:04] <Trisox> $("#chatMessage").val("").focus();
[12:42:22] <Trisox> should work
[12:42:45] <jtallis> Oh, I knew about that .. I just thought .focus() would attempt to focus the value rather than the field... i'll try.
[12:46:36] <Xotix> johnkpaul trisox i got the problem. the name="myIframe" seems not to work or be reserved. myIframe1 works. . .
[12:47:02] <Trisox> :D hehe weird
[12:47:05] <Trisox> jtallis: http://jsfiddle.net/Ud2mr/
[12:47:08] <Trisox> like that?
[12:47:47] <jtallis> Ya :P
[12:48:01] <Trisox> :)
[12:48:31] <Trisox> http://speakerdeck.com/u/addyosmani/p/the-jquery-essentials-1 <-- good read
[12:48:45] <Trisox> if your rusty or new
[12:49:25] <Trisox> Xotix: i never heard of myIframe beeing reserved
[12:49:46] <Xotix> Trisox me neither. Anyway, i'll investigate that later
[12:57:57] <Trisox> Xotix: dont seem to find any cases with my search terms where it is reserved.. myIframe is used a lot in examples thats about it
[12:58:06] <gweedo767> so no takers on why .height isn't updating after a .load and .slideDown?
[12:58:25] <Trisox> let me read
[12:59:10] <Trisox> try $("#sidemarkAllContainer").css('height')
[12:59:29] <gweedo767> that returns it with 'px' on it right?
[12:59:31] <Trisox> does give you extra px extention ;)
[12:59:35] <Trisox> yup
[12:59:43] <gweedo767> let me see if it atleast returns right
[12:59:53] <Trisox> slice that off or replace the px
[13:00:17] <gweedo767> sidemarkAllContainer height: 0 common.05.02.2012.js:1021
[13:00:18] <gweedo767> other height: 0px
[13:00:22] <gweedo767> :(
[13:00:28] <MyNameIsDavid> .outerHeight ?
[13:00:36] <Trisox> indeed other option
[13:00:41] <Trisox> can you show me the page?
[13:00:58] <Trisox> ?paste
[13:00:58] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:01:29] <gweedo767> give me a sec...its a mess someone else made that I am having to add something to
[13:01:49] <New0> $('#songs-view td').click( call_function ); how to?
[13:02:02] <dabaR> I've got this selector: input:hidden [value="IMG_0053.png"]
[13:02:22] <dabaR> But it is not selecting this element: <input type="hidden" value="IMG_0053.png" name="photo-names[]">
[13:02:27] <Trisox> $('#songs-view td').click(function(){  thisisyourfunction();  });
[13:02:28] <dabaR> Why's that?
[13:02:36] <freeed> Is there are method / selector to select elements with certain css? I.e. can I select all elements that do not have left: 0px ; specified?
[13:02:44] <freeed> *a method
[13:03:04] <Trisox> cause it doesnt work like thad :)
[13:03:19] <New0> Trisox, so how can i add a callback funcitno?
[13:03:36] <Trisox> just told you
[13:03:42] <Trisox> or you can do this
[13:03:47] <dabaR> Also, how do I change the selector to make it select the said element?
[13:04:00] <Trisox> (function(){}).trigger();
[13:04:16] <New0> Trisox, hoo tnx
[13:04:21] <Trisox> :)
[13:05:20] <Trisox> $('input[value="IMG_0053.png"]').is(':hidden'); try that
[13:05:49] <dabaR> I am fine with just 'input[value="IMG_0053.png"]' if it worked
[13:05:55] <dabaR> There aren't more than one elements like that
[13:06:07] <dabaR> I'll try that again
[13:06:36] <Trisox> ;-)
[13:06:37] <dabaR> Nothing
[13:06:41] <dabaR> That's why I added :hidden
[13:06:54] <dabaR> I should make a fiddle probably
[13:06:59] <Trisox> 1 sec
[13:07:36] <New0> is this how should look? https://gist.github.com/2588887
[13:08:40] <dabaR> That's ridiculous
[13:08:47] <dabaR> http://jsfiddle.net/3fErN/
[13:09:03] <dabaR> It outputs result to my firebug, not the results square
[13:09:22] <Trisox> prop = attr
[13:09:43] <Trisox> ?prop

[13:10:17] <Trisox> attr('id')
[13:10:24] <New0> ah ok
[13:10:26] <Trisox> ;)
[13:10:43] <ajpiano> dabaR: you need to get rid of the space in your selector
[13:10:57] <New0> and now ? https://gist.github.com/2588887
[13:10:59] <ajpiano> a space is a descendant selector
[13:11:38] <dabaR> Nice
[13:11:42] <dabaR> Thank you very much
[13:11:52] <Trisox> omg how did i miss that
[13:11:53] <Trisox> lol
[13:11:56] <Trisox> hey ajpiano
[13:12:00] <ajpiano> hi trisox
[13:12:26] <Trisox> hows the new-ish job ;-)
[13:12:32] <Trisox> didn know you switched
[13:12:38] <ajpiano> wat
[13:12:51] <ajpiano> i've been at this job for 1 year and 5 months :p
[13:12:53] <New0> i thiink now it's should work. right? https://gist.github.com/2588887 this is the owl code
[13:13:13] <New0> neeeeh don't work
[13:13:22] <Trisox> i know bocoup i didnt know
[13:13:34] <Trisox> i was on there website saw your name adam i was hu.. didn know that
[13:13:44] <ajpiano> hehe :)
[13:14:06] <Trisox> New0: your getting the id of the td right
[13:14:17] <New0> ok i have the <object id="myFlashMovie">  so why it's not working?
[13:14:19] <Trisox> #songs-view td got an id
[13:14:22] <New0> no
[13:14:28] <Trisox> well thats what your saying
[13:14:40] <Trisox> ;)
[13:14:57] <ajpiano> New0: uh.... $("#foo") doesn't return a function
[13:15:06] <New0> #song-view < this is the id. nested td when click. no?
[13:15:18] <ajpiano> New0: your code essentially says $("#myFlashMovie")("ExternalInterfaceExample")
[13:15:20] <Trisox> can you make an jsfiddle?
[13:15:51] <Trisox> ajpiano: othere than that
[13:16:18] <New0> realy? so ... need to click one of the td. when do, then play the song number...
[13:17:08] <Trisox> no lol $('#songs-view td') = $(this)
[13:17:19] <Trisox> if you ask for that attr id
[13:17:21] <Trisox> you get that
[13:17:35] <Trisox> if you give some html to go with your js it would help
[13:17:52] <New0> ok
[13:18:15] <New0> same link? https://gist.github.com/2588887
[13:18:25] <Trisox> anything
[13:18:31] <New0> but u right. i forgot to put an id
[13:19:03] <New0> and it's also need to be the first td i think
[13:19:05] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you around?
[13:19:32] <Trisox> renderd html plz :)

[13:23:13] <New0> hoo come on :) :D anyway i just added an id to the td
[13:24:33] <New0> ok now i fixed it https://gist.github.com/2588887  Trisox
[13:26:38] <jeffsmykil> how come the console prints this correctly but the page prints it incorectly?
[13:26:39] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/wNve4/1/
[13:26:51] <New0> or maybe $('#songs-view td:first').click(function(){  ?
[13:27:10] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: whats up
[13:27:24] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: will you take a look at something for me real quick like?
[13:27:29] <ajpiano> already am
[13:27:32] <jeffsmykil> ty
[13:27:47] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: you shouldn't make your constructor take this long arg list, there's neater ways to do this
[13:28:14] <jeffsmykil> teach me, lay your knowledge smack down upon my brain
[13:28:23] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: you can't just take a complex object and have it stringified magically into the dom
[13:28:23] <Trisox> New0: what is ExternalInterfaceExample
[13:28:29] <ajpiano> console.log is for ddebugging stuff, the DOM isn't
[13:28:35] <someprimetime> ajpiano: congrats on the apt find
[13:28:43] <ajpiano> someprimetime: thanks! :)
[13:28:53] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: am i better off doing this with an xml file?
[13:28:54] <ajpiano> just happy it's over :)
[13:28:58] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: whaaaat no
[13:29:01] <someprimetime> yeah apt hunting is no fun
[13:29:11] <jeffsmykil> im house hunting, now THAT is no fun
[13:29:16] <New0> Trisox, should be a functino inside AS3 but let me check
[13:29:18] <Trisox> me 2
[13:29:47] <someprimetime> yeah that's no fun either especially if it's with your wife/ S/O
[13:29:57] <Trisox> New0: then you got me lost :D
[13:30:04] <someprimetime> thankfully i'm still single and live by myself at the time
[13:30:13] <Trisox> indeed lol
[13:30:20] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: where do i put the octave ;)
[13:30:32] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano just building scales for now
[13:30:37] <ajpiano> ah
[13:30:49] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: this is where something like backbone really starts to help you
[13:31:03] <ajpiano> but first you should learn the basic way of doing it first with just pure js
[13:31:04] <jeffsmykil> i havent heard of that
[13:32:03] <ajpiano> it's client side mvc
[13:32:14] <ajpiano> so you can work with collections of models
[13:32:20] <ajpiano> ie, collections of Notes
[13:32:28] <ajpiano> ?g backbone.js

[13:32:45] <Xotix> i'm trying to access the content of an iframe. the iframe permission denied. why should cors not work with an iframe?
[13:32:54] <New0> ok, Trisox the JS fucntino should run a ActionScript 3 funciton but don't realy know why there is two cuntion here. i will check. but it should send AS3 a var
[13:33:11] <ajpiano> Xotix: how would cors *work* with an iframe
[13:33:25] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: so the way im trying to do it is totally wrong?
[13:33:34] <ajpiano> no
[13:33:46] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: it's just a layer on top of doing what you're doing now
[13:33:51] <freeed> Hey all.. I've got an image with height="100%" width="auto", but $('.myImage').width() just returns 0 not the computed width.. any ideas how I can get the actual computed width of the img?
[13:33:52] <ajpiano> but first you have to undertand what you're doing now
[13:34:06] <jeffsmykil> i thought i did
[13:34:16] <Xotix> ajpiano cors enables cross resource sharing, so if the page which gets laoded by the iframe containts that header, i should be able to access it via js form the main page which contains the iframe, shouldn't i?
[13:34:42] <ajpiano> Xotix: it doesn't just "magically enable cross origin resource sharing"
[13:34:56] <Xotix> ajpiano i've set the header and checked that of course
[13:35:03] <ajpiano> Xotix: it is a particular thing for certain types of ajax-y request
[13:35:13] <ajpiano> it doesn't just mean you can grab an iframe and manipulate its contents, so far as i know.
[13:35:20] <ajpiano> i could be wrong, but i don't believe it does
[13:35:35] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: where can I read more about what I'm trying to do?
[13:37:01] <freeed> Oh, nevermind - the image was in a display: none ; container. My bad.
[13:37:10] <Xotix> ajpiano accessing an iframe with cross domain content doesn't work due to the same origin policy doesn't it?
[13:37:18] <ajpiano> Xotix: correct
[13:37:22] <jstout24> i created a plugin that essentially binds a form event using "on"… if i do something like, "$('form').submittable(); $('form').submittable({ complete: function() { … });", how can i unbind any matched form elements from the first bind and give it to the second bind
[13:37:23] <New0> Trisox, hey. i'm not sure if this will help https://gist.github.com/2588887 but look at the end. i tool a snippet
[13:38:26] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/wNve4/3/
[13:38:46] <Xotix> ajpiano so and cors does say to the browser "this domain is okay, don't block it". As you said, e.g. you can make an cross domain ajax request like this. So if an iframe loads a page containing that header, shouldn't it also work?
[13:39:56] <ajpiano> Xotix: what cors "says to the browser" isn't exactly a technical way of describing it
[13:39:57] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: digesting
[13:40:16] <Xotix> ajpiano http://enable-cors.org/
[13:41:00] <ajpiano> Xotix: as far as i know, cors involves the browser, when it makes an cors request to another domain, it preflights the request with a special request first to see if the request is allowed
[13:41:17] <Trisox> fock i thought he needed an json parse...
[13:41:21] <Trisox> hehe
[13:41:25] <ajpiano> which isn't the same at all as trying to grab the content window of a different domain, at all
[13:41:45] <ajpiano> Xotix: next time google "cors iframe"

[13:42:46] <Xotix> ajpiano thanks
[13:45:42] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: looking up .extend now
[13:45:54] <iateadonut> i have a function that i need to call in two different places.
[13:46:17] <iateadonut> one of those places is the success: callback for $.ajax
[13:46:22] <iateadonut> but i'm not sure how to do that.
[13:46:30] <iateadonut> i need to pass 'data' to that function.
[13:47:12] <ajpiano> iateadonut: give the function a name and pass it by reference
[13:47:30] <iateadonut> yeah.  that did it.
[13:47:52] <iateadonut> 		success: function(data) {
[13:47:52] <iateadonut> 			myFunction(data);  }
[13:47:52] <ajpiano> function foo(data) { alert( data ); }     $.ajax({success: foo});
[13:48:09] <iateadonut> i needed to pass the data from successful ajax, though
[13:48:14] <iateadonut> that's why i had to do the above.
[13:48:42] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: per usual I appreciate  your help
[13:49:07] <ajpiano> iateadonut: no you don't
[13:49:16] <Xotix> ajpiano so how can i post a message from my iframe to it's parent or receive the content of the iframe? postMEssage needs to have the same domain. they are totaly different so i cant set it to the same domain.
[13:49:58] <ajpiano> iateadonut: if you jsut pass the function by reference it will receive the same arguments as if you did it as an anonymous function
[13:50:21] <Xotix> ajpiano a i read it wrong sry! Thank you a lot for this help, really! have a nice day
[13:50:30] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: is there a good way to search those objects?
[13:51:29] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: in a word... looping
[13:51:39] <ajpiano> but this is where you typically want some basic filtering semantics
[13:51:50] <ajpiano> which you can get from underscore.js
[13:51:55] <ajpiano> ?g underscore.js @ jeffsmykil
[13:51:57] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Underscore.js - Open Source - DocumentCloud - GitHub - http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[13:52:03] <bill-barriere> do you guys see anything inheritly wrong with that? http://pastebin.ca/2143557
[13:52:09] <iateadonut> ajpiano, right you are
[13:52:23] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: so much to learn :(
[13:52:29] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: yea
[13:52:35] <iateadonut> so much to learn :)
[13:52:41] <bill-barriere> am i takling this problem the right way? i just want to get the result of the radio box selection back to the page and be able todo some more sql query with it
[13:52:48] <johnkpaul> bill-barriere: .name()?
[13:53:32] <iateadonut> jsfiddle is usually the way to show examples rather than pastebin
[13:53:32] <johnkpaul> there isn't a .name() on a string "#selection" or on a jquery object
[13:53:37] <bill-barriere> i dunno... i just want to have this data somewhere i can access it from php
[13:53:56] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano each is already in jquery why do you need it in underscore too
[13:54:08] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: because some people don't use jQuery
[13:54:18] <Trisox>           ("#selection").name(ref); ?
[13:54:24] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: also undersscore's .each has the same argument order as Array.prototype.forEach
[13:54:27] <ajpiano> which some people like
[13:54:51] <jeffsmykil> ah i thought this was jquery dependent
[13:54:54] <bill-barriere> Trisox, i really have no idea what i am doing, never did any javascript and/or jquery before
[13:55:17] <Trisox>           ("#selection").name(ref);
[13:55:19] <Trisox> OH
[13:55:22] <Trisox> http://speakerdeck.com/u/addyosmani/p/the-jquery-essentials-1
[13:55:24] <Trisox> THERE
[13:55:32] <johnkpaul> :)
[13:55:32] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: one more question?
[13:55:55] <ajpiano> ok
[13:55:57] <iateadonut> is there somethinng like jsfiddle that will support a php script that can be called with $.ajax?
[13:56:14] <Trisox> jsfiddle got echo
[13:56:18] <ajpiano> iateadonut: you can mock your ajax requests on jsfiddle and just tell it exactly what string you want it to return
[13:56:26] <bill-barriere> 60minutes! omg... give me the 5 minute of less resume ;)
[13:56:33] <iateadonut> ah.
[13:56:37] <ryanneufeld> iateadonut: http://codepad.viper-7.com/
[13:56:41] <Trisox> testing ajaxrequests right side bar
[13:56:45] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: how would I access the note part inside of notes[0][0], notes[0][0][Notes] doesnt seem to work
[13:57:02] <ryanneufeld> notes[0][0].notes
[13:57:10] <ajpiano> ^^
[13:57:19] <jeffsmykil> underined
[13:57:20] <iateadonut> ok, well, then, bill-barriere, that's probably the way to show a script to ask for help.
[13:57:26] <jeffsmykil> oh dur
[13:57:39] <jeffsmykil> exxcelent
[13:57:45] <jeffsmykil> cant wait to hammer on some of this this weekend
[13:57:49] <jeffsmykil> thanks ajpiano
[13:58:06] <ajpiano> cool yea it's a lot to bite off
[13:58:12] <ajpiano> but you will learn a lo
[13:58:13] <ajpiano> lot
[13:59:10] <jeffsmykil> learn by doing and making experiments
[13:59:17] <jeffsmykil> i dont learn well reading documentation
[13:59:44] <ajpiano> exactly
[14:00:08] <Trisox> :D
[14:00:26] <Trisox> making experiments is more fun 2
[14:01:11] <Trisox> i'm off for a while like 9 hours or so cu
[14:01:19] <lacrymology> what's a selector that will match "#id_content_{en|es|fr|whateverlanguage}"? if "whatever" can't be done, or isn't the best way, a defined list is OK
[14:02:16] <ryanneufeld> I'm pumped for JQ Con SF this year!
[14:02:46] <ajpiano> wooooooooooooo
[14:02:52] <ajpiano> I HOPE SOMEONE MAKES THE SCHEDULE BE AWESOME
[14:03:08] <New0> anyone here know some flash?(as3) just need to call as3 functino from js already in flace but dunno how to implement
[14:05:09] <ryanneufeld> New0: there is a way in AS3 to call a JS function, there is some setup involved, but it's not hard. ?g as3 call js function
[14:05:38] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: yeah, last year I missed out one talk cause there were two I wanted to attend so I had to make a call
[14:05:49] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: this year it's single track!
[14:05:57] <New0> ryanneufeld, the other way around. call as3 from JS
[14:05:57] <ryanneufeld> :O
[14:06:09] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: but i mean, any conf where you don't have that dilemma is the problem
[14:06:13] <ajpiano> you're supposed to have that problem, lol
[14:06:14] <ryanneufeld> New0: you can do that too, again google is your friend
[14:06:36] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I learned so much last year, and met some pretty cool people, yourself included
[14:06:39] <johnkpaul> I need to book my flight ajpiano
[14:06:42] <johnkpaul> I keep forgetting
[14:06:46] <ajpiano> ... me too :p
[14:06:47] <New0> ok. then the right word? to type. can someone help?
[14:06:48] <New0> tnx
[14:06:53] <ajpiano> both flights and solid peeps :)
[14:07:05] <johnkpaul> :)
[14:07:17] <ryanneufeld> I can't wait to go again. My tix and flight were booked within 30mins of me asking my boss to send me
[14:07:31] <johnkpaul> ryanneufeld: lucky
[14:07:33] <Emn1ty> send you where?
[14:07:42] <johnkpaul> Emn1ty: jquery conf 2012
[14:07:45] <johnkpaul> SF
[14:07:50] <Emn1ty> hm...
[14:08:04] <Emn1ty> never gone to any technology conferences
[14:11:54] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: how long till we can get our grubby mitts on jqui 1.9?
[14:11:54] <ryanneufeld> also, is YayQuery done?
[14:13:19] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: not sure... ask kborchers :p
[14:13:25] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: it's sleeping....
[14:13:30] <ajpiano> with the fishes, it seems :x
[14:13:43] * kborchers hides
[14:13:49] <lacrymology> is there a way of selecting #id_suffix1 #id_suffix2 #id_suffix3?
[14:14:10] * ryanneufeld pokes kborchers 'I see you hiding there! C'mon out!'
[14:14:34] <ajpiano> ?attributestartswith @ lacrymology
[14:14:35] <bot-t> lacrymology, [attribute^="value"]: Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value beginning exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[14:14:39] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: that's too bad, I hope it wasn't due to some falling out
[14:14:49] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: no not at all
[14:14:59] <ajpiano> just busy busy
[14:15:05] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that was my assumption
[14:15:29] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: we're getting closer every day ... just really busy and not quite there yet
[14:15:46] <lacrymology> ajpiano: so '[id^="prefix_"]'?
[14:15:50] <ajpiano> ?tias
[14:15:51] <bot-t> Try It And See
[14:15:56] <ajpiano> you should use another selector in there as well
[14:15:57] <ajpiano> a tag or class
[14:16:03] <ajpiano> those regex-only selectors are pretty bad on their own
[14:16:40] <someprimetime> yeah those selectors are garbage
[14:18:21] <lacrymology> what about something like $("#id_1").or("#id_2").or("#id_3").stuff()?
[14:18:40] <ryanneufeld> lacrymology: do those elements have a common class?
[14:18:53] <jsmonkey> Has anyone used jquery mobile? what does it give you? is any extra lib like angular or backbone recommended to have beside jquery mobile or is jquery mobile even needed?
[14:18:56] <ryanneufeld> lacrymology: if so then $('.classname') would be a better way to find them
[14:19:09] <danzik171> ajpiano: i thought those attribute selectors were legit QSA ones, not anything sizzle is doing - or am i mistaken? ( or are they just slow anyway )
[14:19:12] <ryanneufeld> jsmonkey: I have, it's pretty much a complete framework at the moment
[14:19:49] <ryanneufeld> jsmonkey: m.metrolyrics.com is an example. jquery mobile is useful depending on your use case. For us it made sense
[14:19:55] <jsmonkey> how about event callbacks when certain things like a swype etc happens?
[14:20:05] <ryanneufeld> jsmonkey: have you read the docs?
[14:20:33] <ryanneufeld> jsmonkey: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/api/events.html
[14:20:33] <jsmonkey> not yet. so many options and examples site can only tell the good parts. so wanted to talk to someone who has used it
[14:20:40] <lacrymology> ryanneufeld: if they did, I wouldn't be asking =)
[14:20:42] <BillCriswell> http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/effects/ie6/ Memories =')
[14:21:10] <ajpiano> danzik171: yea but in older browsers, which is where it really matters, it's worst of all
[14:21:27] <ryanneufeld> jsmonkey: start with the docs and see if the current methodology is something you'd like to work with. If so, then giver
[14:22:39] <lacrymology> this is generated code, it's all the same to me to just repeat the code, or to wrap the call three times, whatever, but I wanted to generate better JS
[14:23:04] <jsmonkey> ryanneufeld: thanks for the tip

[14:30:12] <barh> echoing yes for every number
[14:30:13] <barh> wtf

[14:35:16] <kamoricks> You can process this server-side, with libgd or something, or client-side, with creative use of canvas.
[14:36:45] <Amplified_> it has to be client side and with jQuery..
[14:36:55] <Amplified_> I'm a beginner..
[14:39:02] <kamoricks> Well, JQuery doesn't really have much for <canvas>. You just need to use the 9-parameter version of drawImage().
[14:39:55] <barh> uhm, i need help with if statement
[14:40:08] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ barh
[14:40:09] <bot-t> barh, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:40:31] <barh> i want to print break everytime "count" is divided by 4
[14:40:44] <barh> every 4 pictures i want to insert break
[14:41:53] <jtallis> How would I remove an element after it's faded out? Is the only possible by doing $("elem").fadeOut(500, function() { $(this).remove(); }); ?
[14:42:23] <kamoricks> Amplified_: In-channel, please.
[14:42:35] <Amplified_> ok, sorry.
[14:42:44] <Amplified_> Is it ok to paste code here?
[14:42:59] <kamoricks> No.
[14:43:01] <kamoricks> ?p @ Amplified_
[14:43:02] <bot-t> Amplified_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:44:06] <Amplified_> aight thanks
[14:44:23] <barh> check this http://fixee.org/paste/mpnryxh/
[14:44:46] <barh> it inserts break every image
[14:45:00] <barh> i want it to insert break every 4th image
[14:45:05] <kamoricks> barh: That isn't jquery. That isn't even javascript.
[14:45:19] <barh> i know but php channel is locked
[14:45:24] <barh> you guys know php too
[14:45:24] <Amplified_> kamoricks: ok, here it is http://jsfiddle.net/YbpCk/
[14:45:28] <jtallis> You need to identify yourself, barh
[14:45:28] <barh> and might help me..
[14:45:32] <jtallis> basically register your nick.
[14:45:37] <jtallis> then you can join #php
[14:45:46] <barh> cant you help me?
[14:46:00] <jtallis> the issue isn't actually php either.
[14:46:15] <barh> i'm sure most of you know php.. or if statement..
[14:46:15] <jtallis> I don't think.
[14:46:41] <barh> is there anything wrong with my code?
[14:46:56] <kamoricks> barh: Yes. It's not javascript.
[14:47:03] <barh> argh
[14:47:07] <jtallis> Put an inline-block styling on your image tags
[14:47:27] <barh> what you mean by?
[14:47:38] <jtallis> wait, is it actually putting in line breaks, or are the images just separating?
[14:47:53] <barh> break every 4 images
[14:47:55] <kamoricks> Amplified_: http://jsfiddle.net/YbpCk/1/ seems to be working fine, if that's what you want. I thought you were doing some sort of dynamic resizing.
[14:49:21] <barh> how to identify?
[14:49:38] <Amplified_> kamoricks: I want the original picture to change when the screen is smaller than 600 px (in this chase), to a temporary picture which is much smaller in size. But the script isnt working at all.
[14:49:56] <Amplified_> screen/window
[14:50:50] <Amplified_> The script doesn't replace the picture with the temp.jpg.
[14:51:15] <kamoricks> Amplified_: It does for me. Try it yourself. http://jsfiddle.net/YbpCk/2/ .
[14:52:10] <kamoricks> Amplified_: Note that it'll stick at whatever size it was when the page was loaded, so you proably want to put that in a $(window).resize() handler.
[14:53:01] <jtallis> barh, http://codepad.org/GONIJLsO if something like that doesn't work for you ... then add style="display: inline-block;" to your image tag, if you follow my php correctly it should place the line breaks in the correct spot. So if it doesn't work after what I just said, go to #css and try there.
[14:53:25] <barh> kk
[14:53:28] <barh> ty
[14:53:36] <jtallis> if they wont help, then hopefully #php would. /msg nickserv register email@email.com yourpassword
[14:53:38] <jtallis> or something like that
[14:53:42] <jtallis> then /msg nickserv identify yourpassword
[14:53:45] <jtallis> then /join #php
[14:53:56] <jtallis> I'l leave now.
[14:54:05] <fserrano> Quick question: inside .get() I validate data and if success I want to remove parent, but it's not working. Variable in loopback issue? I can post code...
[14:54:38] <Shai-Tan> Is this the right place to ask questions regarding jquery-mobile?
[14:55:18] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks.
[14:55:29] <jonathancutrell> How can I sort elements by whether or not they have a class applied?
[14:55:50] <jonathancutrell> basically I need to sort li elements with a certain class to the top of a ul
[14:55:59] <jonathancutrell> I know to detach and then run sort(a,b)
[14:56:13] <jonathancutrell> but I think I may have the algorithmic side incorrect.
[14:56:26] <Amplified_> kamoricks: great, I got it to work now
[14:57:06] <Amplified_> yeah, the picture is the same size as it was before I hit reload.
[14:59:33] <Amplified_> kamoricks: how do I make the temp pic, say: 100x100 instead of 500x500?
[14:59:49] <kamoricks> Amplified_: .attr('width', 100); .attr('height', 100);
[15:00:03] <kamoricks> Amplified_: But it'd probably be better to change temp.jpg's size on the server, no?
[15:00:35] <Amplified_> kamoricks: yes, its smaller then the original, but resizes.
[15:00:51] <Amplified_> Donno if I've screwed up somewhere else thought..
[15:00:53] <kamoricks> How does a JPG resize? It's a JPG.
[15:03:21] <Amplified_> I think it's bound by the % size
[15:03:57] <kamoricks> Amplified_: There were no CSS styles in the paste, nor were there width or height params.
[15:04:07] <Amplified_> I know. :-3
[15:05:14] <Amplified_> kamoricks: updated, http://jsfiddle.net/YbpCk/3/
[15:06:16] <kamoricks> Amplified_: Yes, "width: 70.36708860759494%" will specify the width.
[15:07:44] <Amplified_> Yeah, fixed it :-)
[15:08:14] <Amplified_> kamoricks: how do I make the temp img clickable, to show the real picture?
[15:08:23] <Amplified_> in original size
[15:08:31] <diverdude> im trying to load the content of a filereader into an <img> tag, like this: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/663965823   I can see when i look at the img.src in line 7 and 9 that it changes, and in line 9 its some long binary value. But the actual image on the screen is not updated. What am I missing since the image is not changing?
[15:10:01] <kamoricks> Amplified_: $("#pic1").click(function () { ... });, plus probably something from jquery-ui to lightbox out an image.
[15:12:58] <Amplified_> kamoricks: http://jsfiddle.net/YbpCk/4/ <- Something like this?
[15:13:43] <kamoricks> Amplified_: Yes, that'll do exactly what you told it to, and that would be one of many reasonable possibilities.
[15:14:13] <Amplified_> kamoricks: To bad it doesn't work :P
[15:14:39] <Amplified_> kamoricks: The temp image is unclickable :/
[15:15:00] <diverdude> strange thing is that if i create a new img node and append it, the image is shown ok
[15:17:57] <Shai-Tan> Is it possible to limit the size of the jquery-mobile display when viewed from a desktop?
[15:18:28] <Shai-Tan> like, apply a max-width of some kind to it?
[15:19:03] <kamoricks> Amplified_: http://jsfiddle.net/YbpCk/5/ <- Key bits are making sure the page loads before executing bindings by putting your things inside an on-load callback ($(function() { ... })), using $(window).resize() to appropriately detect changes, and using console.log() to detect whether things are called.
[15:23:23] <bill-barriere> meh is there a way to simply stuff html in some json without having the damn thing screw everything it think it should escape
[15:23:53] <bill-barriere> eg if i put <h2>blah</h2> in some data it stupidly escape </h2> to <\/h2>
[15:24:50] <Amplified_> kamoricks: I see. Sorry for being a total newbie
[15:28:38] <vacho> what function do I use to make a json submission to a php file?
[15:31:05] <Amplified_> kamoricks: Im afraid ttp://jsfiddle.net/YbpCk/5/ doesnt work. Now the temp picture doesnt load when screen size is 450 :<
[15:32:24] <kamoricks> Amplified_: Is 'replaceImages' invoked?
[15:36:50] <bill-barriere> is hate javascript with a passion :/
[15:36:58] <bill-barriere> s/is/
[15:37:02] <bill-barriere> I
[15:37:09] <kamoricks> And sed, apparently.
[15:37:47] <Amplified_> kamoricks: I think so, I copied what you wrote in jsFiddle
[15:38:12] <kamoricks> Amplified_: Don't think. Breakpoint, or at least, console.log().
[15:40:52] <bill-barriere> kamoricks, but way more for javascript, i want to go back in time and go bomb netscape office, sorry mozilla fan, but this obomination should not had been allowed to live
[15:44:47] <Amplified_> kamoricks: The whole script stopped working using your latest build
[15:45:04] <kamoricks> Amplified_: With what error?
[15:46:39] <Amplified_> kamoricks: no error, but the original picture doesn't get replaced
[15:46:52] <kamoricks> Amplified_: Is replaceImages ever invoked?
[15:47:02] <Amplified_> kamoricks: No
[15:47:35] <kamoricks> Amplified_: Not even on line 12?
[15:49:08] <Amplified_> kamoricks: would you mind just checking my html for me? I feel so clueless
[15:49:34] <Amplified_> It's ok if you don't have time or such
[15:49:45] <kamoricks> Well, I'm sort of getting you to learn how to debug yourself.
[15:50:52] <rakm> can someone tell me what's wrong with this ajax call syntax. i have a feeling that i'm horribly off.
[15:51:33] <Amplified_> kamoricks: yeah I understand, but firebug doesn't give me anything when I ran the latest build.
[15:51:44] <Amplified_> and no error massages
[15:51:49] <rakm> http://pastie.org/3856272
[15:52:01] <kamoricks> Amplified_: Doesn't give you anything? What do you mean, "doesn't give you anything"? No console.log() statements? Did you modify the function to include a console.log() statement?
[15:52:34] <Amplified_> kamoricks: hold on, I actually get the console.log('picture clicked') when I click the picture
[15:53:01] <Amplified_> kamoricks: sorry about that.
[15:53:13] <kamoricks> Amplified_: Okay, so it's recognizing that the picture is being clicked. You know that that function is being invoked. However, that's not the question. The question is whether replaceImages is being invoked.
[15:53:57] <gaius65> What's the proper way to go up the dom tree, something like $('input[type="submit"]').up('form');
[15:54:16] <kamoricks> rakm: Uh. Yeah. What are you trying to do?
[15:54:31] <gaius65> (the function up doesn't exist)
[15:54:50] <rakm> kamoricks trying to submit an ajax request to a rails action
[15:55:10] <Amplified_> kamoricks: Seems so, I put down a log and it seems to work
[15:55:42] <kamoricks> rakm: Did you look at the examples on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ ?
[15:57:19] <rakm> yeah, looking on there now, but getting confused using it with rails
[15:57:30] <kamoricks> rakm: The server technology doesn't matter.
[16:02:45] <Amplified_> kamoricks: Thanks for the help, I'm off to bed.
[16:04:25] <ColKurtz> what type of request rakm ?
[16:04:28] <ColKurtz> GET? POST?
[16:04:48] <rakm> ColKurtz it's a custom action in one of the controllers
[16:04:52] <rakm> Get
[16:04:55] <rakm> GET req
[16:05:06] <ColKurtz> and it needs to return what data?
[16:12:59] <coldhead> juha_: hi
[16:26:11] <rakm> alright let's try this again. Colkurtz, sorry was trying to wrap my head around this
[16:26:27] <rakm> here's the original onclick event handler
[16:26:27] <rakm> <div onclick="<%= remote_function :url => {:action => :select, :id => results_row.id} %>" >
[16:26:28] <ColKurtz> np
[16:26:43] <ColKurtz> ummmmmm
[16:27:03] <rakm> i removed the id
[16:27:15] <ColKurtz> okay sorry, I don't know about coding javascript in ruby
[16:27:16] <rakm> and here's the framework for the ajax i want to convert it to
[16:27:16] <ColKurtz> lol
[16:27:17] <rakm> http://pastie.org/3856407
[16:27:54] <rakm> the remote_function is an old rails helper that just allows asynchronous requests
[16:27:59] <rakm> nothing too special i don't think
[16:28:29] <rakm> the only two things I should have to pass in are the action and the and id
[16:28:47] <rakm> i'm storing the id in data-id attribute
[16:28:56] <ColKurtz> which should be represented by RESTful URL routing right?
[16:29:20] <rakm> not RESTful unfortunately…the action to submit to is a custom action
[16:31:06] <ColKurtz> well if it's a GET request then it needs to be represented by a URL
[16:32:36] <rakm> not sure what kind of request it is actually.. i mean…the old code doesn't specify
[16:35:21] <ColKurtz> a GET request makes a request for a resource from a URL. It requests data. It can be a normal static HTML page, or it could be a search with the URL parameters like /go/to/search?term=search%20phrase.
[16:38:05] <coldhead> cool story ColKurtz
[16:38:25] <ColKurtz> I'm trying to help rakm understand
[16:38:28] <ColKurtz> not tell stories
[16:38:29] <ColKurtz> i give up
[16:39:00] <ColKurtz> you do it coldhead you're better at this
[16:39:03] <coldhead> i'm kidding, Colonel K
[16:39:13] <ColKurtz> :P
[16:39:25] <coldhead> i didn't see the context, i just read your story in isolation
[16:39:30] <coldhead> and deemed it a cool story
[16:39:46] <coldhead> good old rakm
[16:40:05] <rakm> got disconnected, are we still talking about my predicament
[16:40:38] <ColKurtz> lol
[16:40:54] <ColKurtz> In isolation it is a pretty cool story
[16:41:05] <rakm> what story
[16:41:13] <ColKurtz> >random guy ranting about REST and GET vs POST
[16:41:25] <rakm> damnit, i missed it
[16:41:44] <ColKurtz> I could do that in the street in nyc for change.
[16:41:46] <ColKurtz> my new startup
[16:53:28] <vacho> someone please: http://pastebin.com/URCPjc7N
[16:56:00] <Bankzilla> vacho: why are you posting PHP code in a javascript channel?
[17:25:43] <blendedbychris> this is probably a stupid question but can i modify something inside of an iframe with jquery?
[17:26:37] <austinallen> Yes blendedbychris
[17:27:01] <austinallen> JQuery can modify any HTML element registered in the DOM
[17:27:04] <blendedbychris> austinallen: have a hint?
[17:28:21] <blendedbychris> i'm trying like #myIframe video (which is inside of hte iframe)
[17:28:25] <tw2113> wouldn't it be just like selecting dom elements outside of the iframe?
[17:29:22] <blendedbychris> i'm guessing i'm going to run into this issue
[17:29:22] <blendedbychris> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/364952/jquery-javascript-accessing-contents-of-an-iframe
[17:30:08] <danzik17> blendedbychris: try it.  if the iframe is pointing at another domain, then you're correct, you're going to run into the same origin policy.
[17:30:51] <blendedbychris> hrm
[17:31:46] <tw2113> easy solution? ditch the iframe :)
[17:31:54] <blendedbychris> well
[17:32:00] <tw2113> but with video, i can understand not being able to too
[17:32:08] <blendedbychris> yea I have another idea
[17:32:26] <tw2113> hire a guy to hold a monitor for your website?
[17:32:26] <blendedbychris> what's a good way to detect ios or I should say <video> capable MOBILE devices?
[17:33:30] <Lyfesaver> hello everyone =)
[17:34:01] <danzik17> blendedbychris: ?g modernizr
[17:34:16] * tw2113 can't believe he forgot modernizr
[17:34:33] <Lyfesaver> When nestling two jQuery UI accordions, how do I keep the exterior accordion open when I make one of the inner accordion items active?
[17:34:53] <blendedbychris> how about $.support for <video> ?
[17:35:47] <danzik17> blendedbychris: jQuery's focus isn't browser capability detection, use modernizr.
[17:37:18] <blendedbychris> looks more complicated than i need atm … i don't need to learn another library i have about 20mins to fix this eh
[17:37:57] <tw2113> why not just use the video tag and a flash fallback?
[17:38:00] <coldhead> ?ydinop

[17:42:30] <tw2113> *runs away for the lame pun*
[17:43:14] <coldhead> the pun itself is pretty lame but the word spelunker more than compensates
[17:43:15] <coldhead> you done good, son
[17:43:36] <tw2113> i blame Carmen Sandiego for knowing that word
[18:08:56] <coldhead> i'm thinking of getting a club sandwich for lunch
[18:08:59] <coldhead> any objections?
[18:15:10] <tomvolek> HI, I a have a generated html which there is a check list in it with several check marks, I am trying to check marks all these selections at page load time,  I am using this jquery line, but doesnt work, it can be seen at(http://pastie.org/3849957),  any thoughts ?
[18:26:38] <coldhead> tomvolek: the first part of your selector is matching <body> and then you ask for next()
[18:26:41] <coldhead> there is no next()
[18:26:45] <coldhead> try removing the next()
[18:31:37] <tomvolek> ok , let me give a try
[18:33:41] <tomvolek> $('.page-node-add-activity-boards-list .menu-item-form').find('.form-item input[type=checkbox]').each(function(){         $(this).attr("checked","checked");     });
[18:34:02] <tomvolek> coldhead i made it like above and still didn't work
[18:36:11] <ccapndave> Hey all - I am using a $.Deferred to do a bunch of asyncronous calls to populateTorch, each of which has another asyncronous call in it.  However for some reason I can't figure out the done() block never gets called.  If I make populateTorch syncronous it works.  Any ideas would be massively appreciated https://gist.github.com/2590836
[18:40:56] <Eviltwin> For one thing, it's just dfd = $.Deferred();
[18:41:41] <Eviltwin> Also you can do torch.populateUsers(dfd.resolve);
[18:42:18] <Eviltwin> Are you sure the callback is getting called?
[18:42:25] <Eviltwin> Oh actually
[18:42:26] <Eviltwin> Yeah, that's why
[18:42:37] <Eviltwin> The fix I suggested should take care of it
[18:42:50] <Eviltwin> Because there's only one dfd variable in this scope
[18:42:59] <Eviltwin> The loop goes
[18:43:03] <Eviltwin> Each time it replaces dfd
[18:43:11] <Eviltwin> So when the callbacks happen
[18:43:17] <Eviltwin> They all try to resolve the last dfd
[18:44:47] <iateadonut> i'm working on a function that creates a large div next to the node that was clicked.
[18:44:54] <iateadonut> this is how i've got it now:
[18:44:55] <iateadonut> $(node).html(originalHtml + "<div class='keywordGraphDiv'></div>");
[18:45:38] <iateadonut> this makes a large graph, but i want to make sure it only makes the div once, and next time you click on it, it will delete the div.
[18:45:52] <ccapndave> Eviltwin: Aha
[18:46:36] <ccapndave> Eviltwin: I cut out some code for clarity; actually there is some other stuff that happens before resolve in the callback.  How can I make dfd not get replaced in this case?
[18:47:33] <ccapndave> Eviltwin: You are my hero by the way; I have been fighting with this for hours :)
[18:49:14] <ccapndave> Eviltwin: Ah, I figured it out.  Thanks so very much
[18:49:28] <Eviltwin> Rather than for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { /* code */ }, do for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) (function(i) { /* code */ })(i);
[18:49:36] <Eviltwin> And copies will be made for variables
[18:53:52] <ccapndave> Eviltwin: Here, at last, is the working version (in coffeescript) https://gist.github.com/2591228
[18:58:05] <someprimetime> is coffeescript worth learning?
[18:58:14] <someprimetime> like what benefit would i get over normal js
[18:58:19] <someprimetime> i've been contemplating learning it
[18:58:21] <Eviltwin> Some things are more succinct
[18:58:32] <Eviltwin> It uses a more ruby-like syntax
[18:58:54] <someprimetime> ah so leaving off semi-colons to maintain ultimate hipsterness
[18:58:55] <someprimetime> nice
[18:59:22] <coldhead> tomvolek: try running that code from your console, one part at a time
[18:59:32] <someprimetime> i do like how square = (x) -> x * x  is the equivalent to square = function(x) { return x * x; };
[18:59:33] <someprimetime> kinda coo
[18:59:34] <coldhead> so try just the first selector, before the .find()
[18:59:41] <coldhead> and make sure that returns something
[18:59:44] <coldhead> then add the find
[18:59:47] <coldhead> check that
[18:59:50] <coldhead> and so on
[18:59:56] <coldhead> then you can find the bit that is broken
[19:07:10] <tomvolek> ok thanks coldhead
[19:07:35] <iateadonut> i'm trying to bind a function to the every <td> in the first column of a table.
[19:07:56] <iateadonut> $('#ranking_report tr td') - that selects EVERY <td>;  i'm looking for only the first <td> after EVERY <tr>
[19:08:17] <ajpiano> iateadonut: $("#ranking_report td:first-child")
[19:09:29] <iateadonut> wow.  thanks.
[19:09:44] <iateadonut> (i was trying :eq(0) before)
[19:13:35] <pifantastic> Anyone need help?
[19:13:45] <pifantastic> I'd be down to help someone
[19:13:47] <pifantastic> 'bout now
[19:14:13] <coldhead> pifantastic: why do bad things happen to good people?
[19:14:46] <coldhead> i have a follow up question: how do i make a girl like me and how do i know if she does?
[19:14:51] <WillMarshall> Hey! When I'm using JQuery.ajax with get - is there any way I can get the full URL that's generated back out?
[19:16:05] <hothead> coldhead: the trick is to wear designer skirts
[19:16:19] <hothead> WillMarshall: interesting though
[19:16:21] <hothead> thought*
[19:16:33] <coldhead> brb designer skirt shoping
[19:16:38] <systemfault> WillMarshall: You should know the URL since you used it for your ajax call
[19:16:38] <WillMarshall> Well, I want to keep it matched via pushstate
[19:16:48] <WillMarshall> systemfault: the URL including the params string...
[19:17:05] <WillMarshall> systemfault: I can build it myself, but I'd rather ask Jquery for it so I'm not implementing the same construction twice
[19:17:14] <systemfault> Ahhh ok
[19:17:15] <coldhead> i would set up a proxy and get it out of the logs
[19:17:49] <WillMarshall> Nah, I know the URL already
[19:17:56] <WillMarshall> I just want to be able to yoink it programmatically
[19:18:03] <WillMarshall> Rather than relying on a coincidentally parallel build
[19:18:14] <coldhead> eloquently stated
[19:18:27] <coldhead> and nice capitalisation
[19:18:40] <hothead> WillMarshall: no, it doesn't look like it is part of the jqxhr object
[19:18:48] <WillMarshall> hothead: Bugger. Oh well
[19:20:29] <xp_prg> is there an onreset event?
[19:20:45] <hothead> WillMarshall: if you use $.ajax you can do this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3828104/how-to-get-request-url-in-a-jquery-get-ajax-request
[19:20:55] <hothead> xp_prg: like, the reset button?
[19:21:17] <Lyfesaver> When nestling two jQuery UI accordions, how do I keep the exterior accordion open when I make one of the inner accordion items active?
[19:22:01] <xp_prg> ya
[19:22:59] <hothead> xp_prg: just bind to the click event for that reset button
[19:23:49] <hothead> Lyfesaver: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/479270/jquery-nested-accordion-menu
[19:24:06] <hothead> although I imagine if you're nesting accordions you've probably got a UX problem on your hands
[19:24:14] <Lyfesaver> ty hothead, i did read that, but even using that code it stillwont stal open =(
[19:24:25] <Lyfesaver> ya
[19:24:27] <Lyfesaver> for sure
[19:24:37] <xp_prg> hothead you are wise beyond your years
[19:29:02] <hothead> Lyfesaver: that code totally works: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/w9rzU/
[19:29:47] <Lyfesaver> good call, hothead. I am digging into my CSS =) thx
[20:30:59] <coldhead> tomvolek: any luck?
[20:39:49] <coldhead> well it looks like all the cases are closed
[20:39:52] <coldhead> great work everyone
[20:39:57] <coldhead> lets close this channel now
[20:40:07] * hotass flips large toggle switch on the wall
[20:40:19] <StevenCodes> haha @hotass
[20:40:27] <hotass> whoops, forgot I was still hotass
[20:40:38] <StevenCodes> haha!!
[20:40:54] <pifantastic> my bad, was just visiting some other channels

[20:41:45] <StevenCodes> thanks
[20:52:23] <gavin_huang> I bind some events (delegated & non-delegated) with .on(). is it possible to only remove non-delegated ones? the docs says if you pass "**" to .off() has the selector param, it will only remove delegated events. i would like to do the opposite of it. is it possible?
[21:00:11] <Bankzilla> gagiven_huang: I was going to do delegate/ non-delegate, except i went a more direct approach try .nextAll() and .prevAll()
[21:00:22] <Bankzilla> ?nextall @ gaving_huang
[21:00:23] <bot-t> gaving_huang, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[21:02:11] <gavin_huang> Bankzilla, you mean bind handlers directly to elements? well, that's not quite what I'm look for. but thanks anyway. If I can't find another way, I will try it. :)
[21:03:54] <Cork> gavin_huang: it is doable, but you would have to extend jquery
[21:04:06] <Cork> gavin_huang: its not exposed in the api
[21:05:22] <Cork> gavin_huang: (that was for your original question)
[21:07:45] <gavin_huang> Cork, that's good to know. at least help me comfirm that I didn't miss anything in the docs. I'm creating a ticket for it, hope they would expose an API. :)
[21:10:19] <lifeiscontent> how can I get the width of an element without its border?
[21:10:43] <gavin_huang> done: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11693
[21:12:40] <gavin_huang> lifeiscontent, you can try .width() + parseInt(css('border-left-width')) * 2
[21:12:47] <gavin_huang> or .outerWidth() - parseInt(css('border-left-width')) * 2
[21:13:09] <Cork> ?.innerWidth @ lifeiscontent
[21:13:10] <bot-t> lifeiscontent, .innerWidth(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding but not border. http://api.jquery.com/innerWidth/
[21:13:23] <gavin_huang> forget the first method
[21:13:52] <lifeiscontent> Cork: see, I tried that but I got the same exact output as Width and outerWidth… but I am also using jQuery 1.5 :/
[21:14:21] <Cork> ?demo @ lifeiscontent
[21:14:22] <bot-t> lifeiscontent, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[21:14:33] <gavin_huang> I guess I have to the docs again. :D
[21:14:51] <Cork> it should have 1.5.x in there if i remember wrong
[21:15:00] <Cork> *if i don't remember wrong XD
[21:15:38] <pifantastic> lifeiscontent: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/GZeBu/2/
[21:23:28] <shoky> gavin_huang: why not just give the delegated events a differnet namespace than the non-delegated
[21:24:26] <Cork> shoky: you can't remove everything except a namespace
[21:24:46] <shoky> what?
[21:25:02] <Cork> shoky: he wants to remove everything thats not delegated
[21:25:25] <shoky> ok , that's everything with namespace 'myEventsNotDelegated'
[21:25:49] <Cork> shoky: he might not have control of the other event binders
[21:25:59] <shoky> he said he's binding them
[21:26:12] <shoky> with .on
[21:26:33] <shoky> that's what my answer is based on, at least ;p
[21:26:35] <Cork> no he said he bound some delegated handlers
[21:26:43] <shoky> <gavin_huang> I bind some events (delegated & non-delegated) with .on().
[21:26:48] <Cork> and wants to remove everything else
[21:26:58] <shoky> <gavin_huang> I bind some events (delegated & non-delegated) with .on(). is it possible to only remove non-delegated ones?
[21:27:33] <Cork> ah... linebreak >_<
[21:27:49] <shoky> ^_^
[21:28:29] <Cork> its freeking annoying when irc breaks the line at just the right position so you risk missing part of the text :/
[21:28:45] <shoky> breaks? what do you mean
[21:29:07] <gavin_huang> shoky. I'm sure namespace can help here, and if we use multiple namespaces it can be more elegant: '.myevent. myeventdelegated'. but I think the API should be symmetrical. if you can remove all & delegated only directly, why not non-delegated only?
[21:29:08] <shoky> i only miss any text when someone writes something too long
[21:29:11] <Cork> the text wraps
[21:29:39] <pifantastic> gavin_huang: all delegated events are attached to the same element
[21:29:51] <shoky> gavin_huang: because it's better to code more elegant
[21:30:05] <pifantastic> so they're easier to remove
[21:30:26] <shoky> Cork so you can see the rest on the next line :P
[21:30:56] <Cork> shoky: sure, & non-delegated was just put in between the timestamps so i missed it
[21:31:17] <shoky> ok i accept your.. excuse :P
[21:31:20] <gavin_huang> pifantastic, yeah, i know that. but IMHO, if you can do that, it's more elegant: $('div').off('click', "*|")
[21:31:36] <gavin_huang> "*|" is the invented part. :)
[21:31:40] <Cork> shoky: no excuse, its a what happend, its still my error
[21:32:03] <gavin_huang> which removes non-delegated handlers only
[21:32:19] <shoky> Cork ok , jk;p
[21:32:23] <Cork> i would prob go with !** or similar
[21:32:37] <Cork> *| is none obvius
[21:32:40] <shoky> this is the opposite of elegant
[21:32:46] <shoky> (all of these examples0
[21:32:47] <shoky> )
[21:33:06] <shoky> for edge cases
[21:33:29] <shoky> won't be surprised if the "**" option is removed sometime in the future
[21:34:02] <Cork> well namespace is elegant as long as you know what events is bound
[21:34:14] <Cork> its when you don't that it becomes a problem
[21:39:32] <shoky> gnight
[21:39:40] <gavin_huang> shoky, night
[22:00:51] <iateadonut> i'm trying to rebind a function to a <td> ('click'), when i click a span within that <td>, but when i rebind it, it acts as if the click that rebound it also activated the function.
[22:01:01] <iateadonut> i would like to rebind without activating the function.
[22:05:41] <coldhead> i dreammmmmed a highway back to youuu
[22:05:41] <iateadonut> $.stopPropagation(); did it.
[22:07:25] <iateadonut> no it didn't
[22:07:36] <iateadonut> it merely broke my function
[22:24:43] <infid> anyone know why when i send a string that contains french accented characters via the 'data' attribute of $.ajax, it ends up being converted to an html &entity; ?
[22:27:23] <iateadonut> Cork, coldhead, any idea?
[22:27:36] <iateadonut> infid: datatype
[22:27:43] <iateadonut> http://jsfiddle.net/SM9EL/ - here's an example.
[22:28:19] <iateadonut> run it and click on any one of the words in the first column of the table.
[22:28:25] <iateadonut> then click on [close]
[22:28:43] <iateadonut> then uncomment this line:   //$('#ranking_report td:first-child').on('click', function() {    keywordGraphs(this);    });
[22:28:48] <iateadonut> and then try again
[22:28:52] <iateadonut> you can see it makes it go through a loop.
[22:29:02] <iateadonut> how can i stop that loop?
[22:30:20] <infid> iateadonut: well, I need it to post as json
[22:31:58] <iateadonut> maybe you can try a metatag that shows your page is utf8?
[22:34:09] <infid> already am
[22:35:51] <iateadonut> did you try in your js source code, data: { whatever: 'fancy french character' }  - as a literal string that way you can see if the conversion happens before or after ajax gets a hold of it?
[22:39:24] <infid> yeah
[22:39:30] <infid> .val() is doing it
[22:39:37] <infid> i think
[22:40:53] <iateadonut> when you do 'alert( .val();' does it display correctly?
[22:41:10] <infid> yeah
[22:43:53] <infid> doesn't make any sense
[22:44:17] <infid> it's fine in the javascript side, it's the second that it gets to the server that it's converted to the &entity;
[22:44:31] <infid> even though the server is currently not doing anything but printing the value it got from the client's ajax call
[22:44:31] <Wilornel> Guys what the hell am I doing wrong?
[22:44:42] <systemfault> EVERYTHING!
[22:44:50] <systemfault> j/k

[22:45:16] <Wilornel> Here
[22:45:25] <Wilornel> Its the function from learningjquery
[22:45:53] <coldhead> infid: i've fixed similar issues before by utf-8ing headers everywhere
[22:46:20] <coldhead> but man, europeans ruin everything with their fancy languages
[22:46:30] <coldhead> 7 bit AMERICAN ascii was good enough for jesus
[22:46:34] <coldhead> and it's good enough for me
[22:46:52] <systemfault> Wilornel: That's a strange testcase because usually, you would listen to the "submit" event and not the "click" event for an input type="submit"
[22:47:01] <infid> coldhead: how do you set the encoding in the ajax call?
[22:47:11] <infid> coldhead: because the meta tag on the js is alreayd set to utf-8
[22:47:18] <coldhead> oh right
[22:47:18] <Wilornel> systemfault: but it still should work, right?
[22:47:25] <systemfault> Y U NO LIEK MY ÉÉÉÀùç?

[22:53:06] <systemfault> I mean.. JSON is by definition utf-8 afaik
[22:53:09] <Wilornel> what causes my function to fail?
[22:53:30] <systemfault> Wilornel: I can only guess because I cannot test.
[22:53:36] <Wilornel> Why not?
[22:54:09] <systemfault> Wilornel: Because it doesn't make sense to add a click handler to a submit button.
[22:54:23] <Wilornel> ......
[22:54:25] <Wilornel> who cares?
[22:54:31] <Wilornel> you can add a click handler to text...
[22:54:33] <Wilornel> It also works
[22:54:40] <Wilornel> I changed it to submit and it doesnt work...
[22:54:55] <coldhead> can you guys all keep chatting until my paste of shame is utterly scrolled into oblivion?

[23:05:46] <iateadonut> did you take a look at it?
[23:05:49] <iateadonut> (thanks)
[23:12:12] <coldhead>  i looked but i don't understand the problem
[23:22:00] <iateadonut> maybe this will make more sense: http://jsfiddle.net/SM9EL/1/
[23:22:13] <iateadonut> i want to NOT be able to click on the big white box that appears.
[23:22:19] <iateadonut> to make it disappear.
[23:22:45] <iateadonut> so i use: //$(node).unbind();
[23:22:50] <iateadonut> but i can't rebind.
[23:24:25] <iateadonut> also, i'm using $(document).ready(function () {  working in firefox, but doesn't work in chrome.
[23:25:17] <iateadonut> wondering if there's a better function to use that waits until more stuff is loaded?

[23:30:33] <coldhead> that waits for all images :(
[23:31:16] <coldhead> iateadonut: rather than bind and unbind
[23:31:25] <coldhead> why don't you just make the handler more intelligent
[23:31:32] <coldhead> so it knows whether or not to close
[23:32:10] <coldhead> i do this kind of thing: .on('click', function (e) { if ($(e.target).is('somethingspecial')) return;
[23:33:00] <coldhead> ya feel me?
[23:42:52] <iateadonut> trying that, but is this what i'm supposed to do:   { if ($(e.target).is('#divThatIDon'tWantToTriggerFunction'))  coldhead
[23:43:52] <coldhead> that should work
[23:44:04] <coldhead> except 'return' instead of 'coldhead'
[23:44:52] <farhad2161> how can i find and change the color of an <a> tag that contain onclick="test()" in my page? i do not want to set id or class for  <a> tag
[23:45:49] <coldhead> iateadonut: thusly http://jsfiddle.net/dfEgY/
[23:46:21] <coldhead> you can't really do it, farhad2161
[23:46:30] <coldhead> you shouldn't be using onclick anyway
[23:46:57] <coldhead> $('a[onclick="test()"]').css('color', 'eggplant') might work
[23:47:02] <coldhead> but i feel bad just typing it
[23:47:25] <gloomer> lol
[23:49:23] <iateadonut> yes, that works.
[23:49:38] <iateadonut> BUT, there's so many other elements within that element, and all of them still...
[23:49:51] <coldhead> iateadonut: http://jsfiddle.net/dfEgY/1/
[23:50:01] <coldhead> ?closest @ iateadonut
[23:50:01] <bot-t> iateadonut, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[23:50:02] <iateadonut> is there an .isnot?
[23:50:22] <coldhead> just reverse the conditional
[23:50:25] <coldhead> ! .is()
[23:50:48] <coldhead> but the second thing using closest is better because it checks the element and its ancestors
[23:50:56] <iateadonut> oh, duh.
[23:51:10] <iateadonut> ah
[23:51:17] <farhad2161> coldhead: it worked but why you feel bad just typing it
[23:52:13] <coldhead> because you shouldn't be using onclick
[23:52:26] <coldhead> and you even more shouldn't be asking jQuery to find things based on your use of onclick
[23:52:31] <coldhead> onclick is so last century
[23:52:47] <coldhead> your html should not contain any javascript
[23:52:54] <coldhead> and onclick does exactly that
[23:53:12] <coldhead> every time you use it, an unbaptised child is killed
[23:53:39] <iateadonut> coldhead.  thanks.
[23:55:01] <coldhead> good luck iateadonut !
[23:55:36] <iateadonut> it works.
[23:55:41] <Xotix> how would i do an ajax file upload ( no plugins please.
[23:55:52] <farhad2161> coldhead: It does not work in IE :(
[23:56:12] <coldhead> good, you shouldn't do it anyway farhad2161
[23:56:19] <iateadonut> coldhead, may i pm you?
[23:56:49] <coldhead> Xotix: you are basically asking "how can i spend weeks reinventing a wheel and struggling to test it properly and everywhere"
[23:56:54] <coldhead> it's a very sad story
[23:57:00] <coldhead> if you must, iateadonut
[23:57:07] <coldhead> it better be about nude pictures though
[23:57:31] <coldhead> Xotix: you can start on your highway of despair by trying to do it with an iframe
[23:57:39] <coldhead> god help you
[23:58:40] <Xotix> coldhead, so i'd need to use basic xmlhttprequest and build it. I can't just use e.g. $.post/$ajax on a form and it dfoes the magic? Coldhead, i'm goign to to the iframe for sure for ie (its a cross domain file upload with pseudo ajax) but i wanted to use it as a fall back and use xmlhttprequest v2 for other browsers. But if its a hard way, i will stick with the iframe for every browser.
