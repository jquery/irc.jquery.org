[00:08:42] <fRAiLtY-> Any logical reason why this line:  window.opConfig = new Product.Options([]); would give me "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" ?
[00:08:54] <granden> http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/narrowing/ - This is acctually pretty close to what I'm looking for. But would like a jquery plugin or similair. Anyone familiar with one? Difference here is the list get smaller and is seperated from the filter box?
[00:18:04] <cat3> howdy, folks!
[00:19:49] <Whirl3d> granden, I think the autocomplete will work the same way.
[00:25:18] <lanken> I have a $("td").click event that runs $.getJSON , and then tries to set the background color of the <td> to a value from the JSON
[00:26:22] <lanken> I tried to use $("this").css("background-color",data["color"]); as the function to set the color of <td>, but it appears that I need a different $.("this")
[00:26:35] <lanken> err, s/$./$/
[00:28:14] <rindolf> lanken: $("this") will find an element called <this>
[00:28:20] <rindolf> lanken: maybe you want $(this)
[00:28:31] <aqeel> remove quotations
[00:29:11] <lanken> sorry, I copied it over wrong. This is the line I have now.		$(this).css("background-color", data["color"] );
[00:34:20] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/d8nuzkrtfwqupbdvdqvig - the post link works, but the remove() function doesn't. If the post-link isn't active, the remove() does work, however.
[00:53:09] <lanken> rindolf: I did a workaround using .addClass and .removeClass
[00:53:12] <lanken> rindolf: http://jsfiddle.net/6G8d3/
[00:53:27] <rindolf> lanken: OK.
[00:53:32] <lanken> rindolf: it feels like this can't be the best way of doing it, but I hope this illustrates what I'm trying to do.
[00:54:12] <lanken> the problem is that $(this) doesn't work in the scope of the function called by $.getJSON
[00:54:30] <rindolf> lanken: it is a good idea to manipulate classes instead of tempering with the CSS itself.
[00:55:11] <rindolf> lanken: getJSON can only be done from a local host.
[00:55:16] <lanken> rindolf: I need to tamper with the CSS. The background color is on a server-side DB
[00:55:18] <rindolf> I think.
[00:55:33] <rindolf> lanken: ah.
[00:55:35] <lanken> rindolf: the JSON is working fine on my testing machine
[00:56:33] <lanken> rindolf: yeah, it's a local host. I'm just wondering how to identify "the-element-which-was-clicked" inside the function that's executed on successful JSON retrieval.
[00:57:30] <Shadowofmir> Hi guys, i have a little problem... :/ i do not get back the elements i create. Here is the code
[00:58:00] <rindolf> lanken: well, it won't work on jsFiddle.
[00:58:27] <Shadowofmir> http://jsbin.com/welcome/63083/edit
[00:59:54] <lanken> rindolf: I posted it there so that you can see what I'm trying to do. I just need the $(this) from the line  ----  $(this).addClass("working");  --- to be accessible inside here ---- .getJSON('url', function(data) { *** in here ***; }) ---
[01:00:15] <rindolf> lanken: then do var that = this;
[01:00:41] <rindolf> lanken: this is very fickle.
[01:01:00] <lanken> rindolf: should I do, like, var obj = $(this) , and then refer to obj inside of the getJSON function? I guess I can try it.
[01:01:15] <lanken> rindolf: ok, cool.
[01:01:39] <lanken> rindolf: I see. I'm currently just kind of trying to work out comms end-to-end...I'll try to avoid this kind of nonsense in the future.
[01:01:53] <rindolf> lanken: comms?
[01:02:22] <lanken> rindolf: AJAX, etc.
[01:02:25] <rindolf> lanken: yes, var obj = $(this) should work too.
[01:02:29] <rindolf> lanken: communications?
[01:02:31] <lanken> rindolf: just want to make sure I can get the data and play with it.
[01:02:41] <lanken> rindolf: right, communications.
[01:03:02] <Shadowofmir> This is evil :D....
[01:03:48] <lanken> rindolf: sweet, working now :)
[01:05:12] <Shadowofmir> ... yea i saw, it's funny but != true
[01:10:13] <rindolf> lanken: <lanken> rindolf: sweet, working now :) - excellent.
[01:10:27] <rindolf> lanken: BTW, there are some JS debuggers such as Firebug.
[01:11:00] <rindolf> But real mean use alert!
[01:11:02] <lanken> rindolf: is that the "inspect" plugin for FF?
[01:11:22] <lanken> rindolf: I deleted like 5 alert() calls before posting it...
[01:11:34] <lanken> I'm currently on Chrome
[01:11:34] <rindolf> lanken: ah.
[01:11:47] <rindolf> lanken: Firebug is a different extension.
[01:12:05] <rindolf> lanken: there's also Chromebug and something built-in in Chrome.
[01:12:06] <lanken> the built-in HTML and CSS inspector is nice, and I'm hitting the Console occasionally, which is how i can see the JSON errors on JSFIDDLE
[01:12:16] <trinadh_> chrome dev tools
[01:12:19] <rindolf> Well, Opera has Dragonfly and MSIE has something of its own.
[01:12:40] <rindolf> lanken: anyway, are you familiar with debuggers of other languages?
[01:12:57] <lanken> rindolf: hah, what's giving me awayL
[01:12:57] <rindolf> lanken: like breakpoints, watch values, REPL, etc.?
[01:13:04] <lanken> rindolf: not much, no.
[01:13:10] <rindolf> lanken: OK.
[01:14:24] <rindolf> lanken: well, see this - http://thecodecentral.com/2007/08/01/debug-javascript-with-firebug (didn't read it - just found it in a web search).
[01:15:40] <rindolf> lanken: back in my days, I debugged C and C/C++ code using the Turbo C++ 3.0 (for DOS) debugger.
[01:18:14] * rindolf also uses the perl debugger (perl -d) even though it's not too popular among Perl developers.

[03:00:21] <anew> $(.body).delay(); is this legit ?
[03:00:49] <trinadh> nisseni: you want to slide them all up
[03:01:00] <nisseni> trinadh: or remove(), w/E
[03:01:34] <nisseni> trinadh: remove() seems to be working, not slideUp, only applies to one

[03:02:06] <nisseni> trinadh: thanks tho :)

[04:08:33] <psyolus> Ah. I'm silly. Never mind.
[04:11:53] <johnline> hello i need help with a funtion that is supposed to detect whether and object is visible on the fly
[04:11:54] <johnline> http://jsfiddle.net/pukCb/1/
[04:20:45] <trinadh_> johnline: what is meant by on the fly..
[04:21:39] <AQEEL> johnline: visibility makes use of visibility property of css and not display none....it is visibility hidden or visible
[04:21:42] <trinadh_> johnline: a function fires when some event takes place. http://jsfiddle.net/pukCb/1/
[04:21:46] <johnline> it seems like its not always checking whether the img is visible, only on dom load
[04:22:26] <trinadh_> johnline: yes thats what it will do as it is written to fire on dom load
[04:22:32] <johnline> /2/ ?
[04:22:45] <trinadh_> http://jsfiddle.net/pukCb/3/
[04:24:13] <johnline> thanks for the help
[04:24:40] <trinadh_> AQEEL: I think he wants to know if the image is being visible to user or not.., am i right jhonline:
[04:24:42] <johnline> i read somewhere that :visible also checks for the display:block etc
[04:25:09] <johnline> i have slideshows that hide and show imgs via display:none/block
[04:25:35] <AQEEL> why not use prebuild, show() and hide() methods
[04:25:41] <johnline> so i am trying to make some code that checks for when all the last-childs of the slideshows are shown, to have it then trigger an event
[04:25:57] <johnline> its kinda set in its ways
[04:26:30] <trinadh_> johnline: then evry time the image is shown fire the function to check
[04:26:31] <NodeX> is(":visible");
[04:27:04] <trinadh_> AQEEL: how long have you been back.. ?
[04:27:08] <trinadh_> :)
[04:27:15] <AQEEL> .is() is good to use in such situation
[04:27:21] <AQEEL> just now
[04:27:29] <trinadh_> k
[04:28:42] <johnline> i will show what i am up to, the code is bad atm i know, i'll refactor at the end: http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/data/xmas2012/
[04:30:29] <johnline> so the code that i am trying to create checks when all 25 squares are on the last img, to trigger a congrats
[04:35:11] <trinadh_> johnline: see if this would get you an idea of how to check.. , http://jsfiddle.net/pukCb/4/
[04:35:26] <trinadh_> see you all
[04:35:33] <AQEEL> bye
[04:35:56] <AQEEL> johnline: since all your pictures have last state..
[04:36:22] <AQEEL> why not simply triger after all images reached the last state
[04:36:52] <AQEEL> like if img reached last state. and no more image to shuffle,....congrats
[04:38:03] <johnline> wew i think this is what i need
[04:38:24] <johnline> i did try doing that with the slideshow plugin, but it only works for automated slideshows
[04:39:40] <AQEEL> may be you did not tweak the right place
[04:39:50] <johnline> spent a lot of time on it lol
[04:40:01] <AQEEL> i can help you
[04:48:53] <mazzachre> I have been asked to create an abomination :( And so I have... http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/p8jkW/1/ Just wondering if anyone have a though (or link to such) about how to better manage easy access to two different functions on a single object simply...
[04:50:10] <mazzachre> In the actual system singleclick opens a simple edit dialog where some select properties of the element can be changed and updated, doubleclick opens the element in its own view with all properties accessible for changing.
[04:51:42] <mazzachre> Also in above code, can I feed the event into the setTimeout function?
[04:54:18] <AQEEL> i dont see you dbl click
[04:55:37] <AQEEL> mazzachre: http://www.addedbytes.com/download/javascript-cheat-sheet-v1/png/ ...see event handlers
[04:55:48] <mazzachre> AQEEL: I don't... I make a timeout on the click and if it is clicked again I run one function otherwise I run the other
[04:56:58] <mazzachre> I know my event handlers... My problem is if you add both click and dblclick to the same element, the click will always be run (as a click is essentially the first part of a dblclick and a dblclick is essentially two clicks in a row)
[04:56:59] <AQEEL> http://jqapi.ru/..see event helpers under events
[04:57:23] <AQEEL> why not use built in dblclick
[04:57:54] <mazzachre> as I wrote before... if I attach both, then click will be run in either case (before dblclick)
[04:58:16] <AQEEL> then you are coding something wrong
[04:59:38] <AQEEL> mazzachre: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5471291/javascript-with-jquery-click-and-double-click-on-same-element-different-effect
[05:02:44] <mazzachre> AQEEL: I have a working solution (which I personally think is cleaner than what they are supposing on stackoverflow) I was wondering more what other people do in similar situations... To avoid this, because it is not nice in an interaction view.
[05:04:53] <AQEEL> they say there is a plugin for that
[05:07:21] <AQEEL> mazzachre: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/FixClick
[05:07:26] <AQEEL> googling for it
[05:08:18] <AQEEL> may be there is a better plugin
[05:11:27] <mazzachre> lol, I have reinvented the wheel...
[05:12:09] <lidenbrock> hello. How can I create a dynamic link using jquery?
[05:12:45] <mazzachre> lidenbrock: what do you want to do? what do you mean by a dynamic link?
[05:13:39] <lidenbrock> a link that uses a variable to be defined
[05:14:05] <lidenbrock> I want to concatenate a fixed link with a value
[05:14:14] <lidenbrock> for example lidenbrock.com/12
[05:14:21] <mazzachre> lidenbrock: OK, I get it
[05:14:57] <mazzachre> lidenbrock: Well, you can set the link to # then use on('click') to set window.location to the place you want to go from a function..
[05:15:30] <mazzachre> lidenbrock: Or you can use the place you set the value you need appended, to change the href attribute of the anchor you use...
[05:16:14] <AQEEL> mazzachre: http://jsfiddle.net/VfJU4/1/
[05:16:44] <lidenbrock> mazzachre: I'm a newbie to jQuery. How would I have to type that?
[05:17:21] <AQEEL> lidenbrock: welcome to jquery
[05:17:46] <mazzachre> lidenbrock: http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/w8MhX/
[05:17:58] <mazzachre> lidenbrock: Sry... was just making you an example ;)
[05:19:01] <Guest4039> Can anyone please help finding out why http://pastebin.com/kdEkSzrg imgPerSlide and imgCount is undefined when creating the object like this  - <script>gallerySlider = new imageSlider('600','186','3','.13','80');</script> this is just driving me crazy, as I am defining those variables..
[05:19:37] <AQEEL> new is evil
[05:20:00] <mazzachre> lidenbrock: http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/w8MhX/1/ sry...
[05:20:11] <mazzachre> lidenbrock: Forgot to set framework to jquery :p
[05:20:20] <AQEEL> mazzachre: did you see the fiddle
[05:20:57] <mazzachre> AQEEL: Ya, mine is better :o) If not as versatile... http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/p8jkW/2/
[05:21:23] <mazzachre> AQEEL: And I am not looking to solve the problem, I am looking for otherways to do the interaction instead of having click and doubleclick on the same page...
[05:21:59] <mazzachre> lidenbrock: Did this answer your problem?
[05:22:28] <AQEEL> i c and btw your console log is not showing any result on my side
[05:23:25] <Guest4039> Anyone, please?
[05:24:06] <mazzachre> Guest4039: Don't use new...
[05:24:33] <murr4y> hi, after updating from 1.7.1 to 1.8.3, outerWidth() doesn't work in some contexts - does anyone know why that could be?
[05:25:24] <AQEEL> 1.8 is a major shift, lots of things will break
[05:26:03] <AQEEL> they did remove some depricated stuff in 1.8
[05:26:18] <Guest4039> mazzachre, that does not change anything, still those two count as undefined
[05:26:34] <NodeX> new is not ALWAYS evil
[05:26:39] <NodeX> that's a misconception
[05:26:49] <murr4y> AQEEL: true, but outerWidth isn't deprecated
[05:26:57] <AQEEL> i know but it depends how much one understands it
[05:27:04] <ruby_on_tails> hello peeps
[05:27:12] <AQEEL> NodeX:
[05:27:28] <AQEEL> no not outerwidth but what you are using this with
[05:27:48] <ruby_on_tails> whats up ?
[05:28:13] <AQEEL> your entire code, you need to inspect..
[05:28:21] <murr4y> AQEEL: it's being used in chosen, here's the line that breaks: https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/blob/master/chosen/chosen.jquery.js#L352
[05:28:27] <mazzachre> Guest4039 Depends on your scope I guess... Would need to see the page to see what is going on... It might very well be defined in one scope and undefined in the scope you try to use it
[05:30:03] <Guest4039> mazzachre, it works on jsfiddle, if I set the jquery to load : "no wrap (head)"
[05:31:03] <ruby_on_tails> hello bot-t
[05:31:03] <bot-t> ruby_on_tails, :)
[05:31:15] <ruby_on_tails> `weather
[05:36:30] <mazzachre> Guest4039 Then you most likely have a scope error on your own page...
[05:38:14] <Guest4039> mazzachre, I pm'ed you
[05:39:24] <Guest4039> mazzachre, and the weird thing is that 3 out of 5 variables are defined, but only two fail to..
[05:39:56] <murr4y> AQEEL: it turns out outerWidth() doesn't work on <select> anymore
[05:40:38] <frantz> Is there a way to add swiping functionality to this piece of code? $('#suprflickrLB .lbImage .lbLeft').bind('click').click(function()
[05:41:00] <frantz> right now its just click, and I'm looking for a way to "swipe" and have the same results as a click would
[05:41:39] <AQEEL> guess you have to read the change log
[05:54:19] <jrockjiggz> I have a form i'd like to disable/enable certain fields.. I do not want these fields to be sent with POST..
[05:54:43] <jrockjiggz> fields.. rather, form sections.. (entire DIVs)
[05:55:27] <jrockjiggz> I was thinking I can serialize a div as the formData... var formData = $('div.active').serialize();
[05:55:46] <jrajav> Don't do that.
[05:56:09] <jrajav> Just use a jQuery selector to disable all 'input' (or whatever) children of whichever div you want to act on
[05:56:25] <jrajav> And then in your onsubmit selectively remove or clear fields that are disabled
[05:57:39] <jrockjiggz> jrajav: if the fields are disabled, i shouldn't need to remove/clear them.. no?
[05:57:50] <jrockjiggz> actaully, yes i would...
[05:58:25] <jrockjiggz> but then, the form would be 'reset' on each submit.. i might not always want that
[05:58:42] <jrajav> Eh, I think you're right
[05:58:55] <jrajav> Disabled fields probably aren't sent with forms
[05:59:01] <jrajav> It's been forever since I worked with them directly
[05:59:26] <jrajav> And yeah, you shouldn't normally clear form fields
[05:59:49] <jrockjiggz> i believe disabled won't send
[06:00:05] <jrajav> So just disable the divs with selectors
[06:00:49] <jrajav> Something like $('#mydiv input').prop('disabled', true)
[06:01:49] <jrajav> :input prob better than input actually
[06:26:01] <greengriminal> Can someone point me in the right direction of using the jquery dialog. I have a table and I want to be able to click on any particular <td> and the jquery dialog appears. I tried the following and this doesn't work $('#myTable td').click(function(){   $('myDialog').dialog('open'); });
[06:29:38] <shoky> greengriminal: $('myDialog') looks for <mydialog> elements
[06:29:44] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/wo78t4gb96h2i6gnkjvnw - I never really understood datepicker - my problem is that when I change "to"-date, the "from"-date is changed to todays date. No idea how to get around this.
[06:37:17] <greengriminal> shoky: I understand that. What I have is a table that is generated using RoR that looks like the following: https://gist.github.com/4328517 not sure if you have much understanding but you can see that from the application.js I tried to set the <td> element when it is clicked and then open 'create_booking' which is a paritial
[06:37:30] <shoky> nisseni: didn't understand the problem
[06:38:31] <shoky> greengriminal: do you have any <mydialog> elements?
[06:38:41] <shoky> greengriminal:  or any <create_booking> elements?
[06:39:16] <shoky> greengriminal:  no, you don't. so  $('myDialog')  or $('create_booking')  is wrong
[06:40:33] <greengriminal> shoky: I used $('myDialog') as an example that I got from a SO question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1224729/using-jquery-to-edit-individual-table-cells
[06:40:56] <shoky> greengriminal: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[06:41:03] <shoky> greengriminal: they meant $('#myDialog')
[06:41:13] <shoky> don't copy & paste.. learn
[06:41:46] <greengriminal> shoky: Wasn't copying and pasting was just using an example. I didn't attempt to use that SO answer that was provided
[06:42:16] <shoky> greengriminal: you know the difference between $('myDialog') and $('#myDialog') ?
[06:42:41] <greengriminal> yeah one's a class and one's an Id
[06:42:45] <shoky> wrong
[06:42:51] <shoky> greengriminal: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[06:43:14] <shoky> even if what you said is true
[06:43:57] <shoky> i dont think you have any element with class 'create_booking'
[06:45:13] <greengriminal> shoky: Okay
[06:52:40] <johnline> hey guys can someone help me with length?
[06:52:42] <johnline> http://jsfiddle.net/pukCb/5/
[06:53:09] <johnline> i am trying to get it to count how many elements match what was defined, then trigger when that count is reached
[06:55:38] <pachet> johnline: http://jsfiddle.net/nf34e/
[06:56:11] <johnline> wow thanks pachet
[06:56:40] <ohcibi> hi, is there something like a button action event? for example when i listen for submit on a form, any event like pressing enter, on a form field, clicking the submit button, pressing enter on the submit button and so on are fireing this event, is there anything for a simple <button> ?
[06:57:31] <pachet> buttons are just elements that submit forms when clicked
[06:57:40] <pachet> so i guess the click event is what you're imagining?
[07:00:08] <ohcibi> pachet: which isnt fired if someone hits enter when he focusses the element
[07:00:40] <deadalus> hello, what would be the best way to display a set of link in a dropdown menu after a successful login event? I'm using the bootstrap framework btw.
[07:00:47] <deadalus> a set of links*
[07:00:57] <pachet> ohcibi: right, that's the form submit event
[07:01:14] <pachet> browsers just do users the favor* of assuming they want to submit if they hit enter
[07:01:22] <pachet> it doesn't correlate with a button element
[07:03:58] <nisseni> shoky: I've got two fields, one field "From" another "To", say these fields says From: 2012-01-14 and To: 2012-06-13. Now I want to edit the "To"-field to 2012-12-30. Then the "From"-field automatically changes to todays date.
[07:04:33] <nisseni> shoky: it's like "from" isn't "allowed" to be smaller than todays date
[07:08:48] <shoky> nisseni:  it's bcz of that  'minDate: +0'
[07:09:19] <nisseni> shoky: ah, thanks! :)
[07:12:42] <hateIE> rawwrr
[07:15:33] <hateIE> when using getJSON .. i use   $.each(json, function(k, v) { console.log(v.eventcount); }); but it triggers twice when theres only 1 result .. any idea?
[07:16:42] <hateIE> one of the iterations is null .. is that expected behavior
[07:16:44] <hateIE> ??
[07:18:42] <tombatron> hateIE, got a sample of the json that is being parsed?
[07:18:49] <hateIE> i think its something screwy with $.each because if i log the json object to the console there is only 1 child object made up from the json
[07:18:59] <hateIE> which is right
[07:20:48] <hateIE> tombatron http://www.souliqradio.net/newsite/eventmanager/createevent.html
[07:21:03] <hateIE> function getAllDetails()
[07:23:34] <hateIE> er

[07:24:26] <marcomartins> Hi
[07:24:30] <marcomartins> I need some help
[07:24:33] <marcomartins> I'm a jquery noob
[07:24:50] <marcomartins> why this doen't work?
[07:24:51] <marcomartins> https://gist.github.com/6e11c5277962c112d8f4
[07:25:08] <marcomartins> the if cannot tell me that the request is isXmlHttpRequest
[07:28:52] <tombatron> hateIE, gimme a sec i'm looking
[07:29:30] <delinquentme> really simple way to generate IDs for objects?
[07:29:35] <delinquentme> like an ID number
[07:30:04] <hateIE> tombatron i just did a little change so the objects have a index number just to show the is truely on 1 result
[07:30:14] <hateIE> there is **
[07:31:53] <hateIE> md5 delinquentme
[07:32:14] <hateIE> nm my brain driffted of to php land
[07:33:49] <tombatron> hateIE, so when i do an "$.each" over {"":{"eventname":"sadfsdfasd","eventdate":"2012-12-28 12:00:00"}} it iterates once
[07:34:21] <Pilate> yep, why would you expect anything else?
[07:34:31] <suppp> hi i'm trying to $.post() some data to a url, but I would actually like the $.post() to load the new page for me and not work in an ajax fashion. I'm basically looking for a way to post some parameters from javascript, to the backend, which will generate a new page for me
[07:34:38] <tombatron> Pilate, I unno
[07:35:06] <suppp> any thoughts on how i can achieve this with jquery elegantly ? ( a non elegant way would be i guess doing a window.location = "newurl.html?uglyparam=string"
[07:35:13] <mikecmpbll> suppp: build a url with params
[07:35:14] <mikecmpbll> oh
[07:35:17] <suppp> :D
[07:35:18] <Pilate> suppp: look at $.load
[07:35:25] <suppp> thanks pilate will do now
[07:35:42] <marcomartins> no help for me pls?
[07:36:11] <Pilate> marcomartins: thats not the final output, nobody could tell you why it doesnt work
[07:36:28] <hateIE> weird
[07:36:29] <Pilate> for instance, is 'url: {{ path('signup') }},' supposed to be quoted?
[07:36:47] <rightnow|w> Im doing an $.ajax() call with window.location as URL, and some addition query strings with data: {}.. Do anyone know how i can get the full ajax call URL inside the .success() or .done() callback? Including both the URL, and the data.
[07:37:16] <marcomartins> Pilate: yes, sorry. The submission is made to the controller, but on the controller the condition         if($request->isXmlHttpRequest()) is not met so it doesn't enter there
[07:37:23] <Pilate> rightnow|w: make your request from within a context that you have the url
[07:37:39] <suppp> Pilate : load is cool, but i dont think is what i need, since it doesnt change the page as i need to . I have a rails page that generates and i need to post some params to it before i generate it
[07:37:45] <Pilate> marcomartins: no, thats not the final output the browser sees, period, which is what we need
[07:38:13] <rightnow|w> Pilate, sorry i dont understand what you mean.
[07:38:30] <hateIE> when the inspector reports the undefined value from v.eventname its saying that its saying its from the $.each
[07:39:30] <Pilate> rightnow: something like: function getUrl(url) { jQuery.get(url, function () { console.log(url) })}
[07:39:48] <marcomartins> Pilate: humm, ok but the final output of the brower is the next step as I have a return on the controller
[07:39:50] <Pilate> hateIE: why are you iterating over an object with jquery?
[07:39:59] <marcomartins> how can I dump it?
[07:40:09] <Pilate> marcomartins: if thats the final output, 'url: {{ path('signup') }},' is not valid javascript syntax
[07:40:15] <Pilate> when you have the final version, feel free to pastebin again
[07:40:23] <rightnow|w> Pilate, problem is i need it with the data: {} aswell
[07:40:41] <Pilate> so add a fucking data parameter, do you not know javascript?
[07:40:59] <marcomartins> Pilate:  it is twig
[07:41:16] <hateIE> because its the only way to act on the multiple json results from $.getJSON ..
[07:41:17] <Pilate> marcomartins: it is not the final output so asking questions is pointless
[07:41:37] <rightnow|w> Pilate: i solved it! thanks! it was as easy as using this.url inside the success()
[07:41:39] <Pilate> hateIE: what the hell are you talking about
[07:41:49] <delinquentme> so there isn't a very jquery-idomatic way to generate numbers to append to the end of an ID name ... some_awesome_div-3
[07:42:07] <delinquentme> I mean I could just increment a var? but that seems kind of brutish?
[07:42:35] <hateIE> returning complex json result as in an array of multiple values
[07:42:43] <Pilate> that's not an array
[07:42:44] <rightnow|w> $.ajax({}).done(function () { alert(this.url); });
[07:42:47] <Pilate> if you had an array, each would work fine
[07:42:51] <Pilate> you dont, you have an object
[07:42:53] <marcomartins> Pilate: but it is where the info is processed
[07:43:04] <marcomartins> Pilate: I'm really noob about js and jquery =/
[07:43:07] <marcomartins> sorry
[07:43:08] <Pilate> marcomartins: if you dont understand what im asking nobody here will ever be able to help you
[07:43:15] <Pilate> you HAVE TO PASTE THE FINAL OUTPUT THAT THE BROWSER SEES
[07:43:20] <Pilate> not what youre templating
[07:43:37] <hateIE> Heh
[07:43:38] <hateIE> as far as php is concerned its a array
[07:43:38] <hateIE> last time i checked
[07:43:54] <Pilate> nope, arrays dont have keys
[07:44:02] <Pilate> your object has keys, and is not an array
[07:45:45] <Pilate> arrays look like this: [1,2,3]; objects look like this {'1':1,'2':2,'3':3}
[07:45:54] <jrockjiggz> ^^
[07:49:09] <hateIE> any way regardless .$each does not care it just iterates the "json objects" that were created from "json_encode" by the php
[07:51:19] <AQEEL> hi channel
[07:51:21] <Pilate> hateIE: lol, you clearly have no idea what youre doing
[07:51:33] <AQEEL> ??
[07:51:38] <AQEEL> what is he doing
[07:51:53] <AQEEL> reinventing the wheel
[07:52:00] <hateIE> Plate your on some serious crack fella
[07:52:45] <suppp> $.ajax({url: "/events/new", async: false});  ... shouldn't this load a new page ?
[07:52:53] <hateIE> i suggest you google "json complex php jquery"
[07:53:39] <Eviltwin> suppp: Depends on what you mean by "load a new page"
[07:53:44] <Eviltwin> And please don't use async: false
[07:53:46] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[07:54:00] <ow1n> If I use $("button").on("click",function(){...} is that supposed to attach to newly-created instances of "button?"
[07:54:17] <Eviltwin> ow1n: Not to instances created after you run that code, no
[07:54:25] <hateIE> its funny because I dont know what terminology would please you .. the INSPECTOR of chrome even knows its a OBJECT
[07:54:29] <hateIE> you must talk bullshit language
[07:54:38] <suppp> Eviltwin : i mean i want to load a new page . refresh the current page ... not sure how to express it . i want it to work just as if i were clicking on a regular <a> link , but post some data as well
[07:54:44] <ow1n> Thanks Eviltwin
[07:54:44] <hateIE> tell a php programmer its not an arary then
[07:54:45] <hateIE> you mug
[07:54:49] <hateIE> fucking prat
[07:54:49] <Eviltwin> hateIE: Can you call JSON.stringify on the object and send the result to us in a pastebin
[07:55:35] <Pilate> "INSPECTOR of chrome even knows its a OBJECT" you were just trying to tell me its an array? lol
[07:55:46] <Eviltwin> suppp: The best way I know to do that is to create a <form> element with the appropriate hidden <input>s and then you add it to the DOM and .submit() it
[07:56:01] <hugo_moss> http://jsfiddle.net/Nx7La/  <--- why is this not alerting 300px?
[07:56:08] <Eviltwin> $.ajax is for when you don't want to navigate
[07:56:15] <Eviltwin> And you want to stay on the same page
[07:56:22] <Pilate> hugo_moss: because CSS doesnt use the equals sign
[07:56:42] <hugo_moss> oh sh*t
[07:56:42] <Eviltwin> hugo_moss: width:, not width= for .main_container
[07:56:48] <hugo_moss> brain fart
[07:56:50] <suppp> Eviltwin: thanks then ... i remember async false used to change the page for you a few years ago. but maybe it was the dojo one ... too bad it's not being used anymore . tx will go with the form
[07:56:51] <hugo_moss> thanks gentlemen
[07:57:17] <Eviltwin> suppp: Yeah, jQuery's $.ajax definitely doesn't do that
[07:58:39] <hugo_moss> obviously a container with a certain width who has children, has children with the same width because its bounded by that containers width. but w3c says that width is not inherited from its parent? what do they mean by inherited?
[07:59:10] <hugo_moss> why does that fiddle alert with 300px for inner_container?
[07:59:24] <Pilate> inherit, the same meaning as real life, it takes on the properties of its parent
[07:59:30] <Eviltwin> An inherited property means the children will effectively have the same property set
[07:59:58] <Eviltwin> The inner container is a block element so it fills the width
[08:00:01] <hugo_moss> right, it says that that property's value, width, is not inherited at w3schools
[08:00:10] <hugo_moss> why would they say that?
[08:00:27] <Eviltwin> Because it's not...
[08:00:37] <Pilate> its a property of block level elements not inheritance
[08:00:54] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/RjZRc/
[08:01:00] <Eviltwin> Notice how these do not have the same width
[08:01:00] <hugo_moss> but block level elements inherit it?
[08:01:57] <Eviltwin> Block elements will try to fill the available width
[08:02:08] <Eviltwin> But padding will cause it to be smaller than the width of its parent
[08:03:03] <johnline> thanks for the help pachet
[08:03:07] <johnline> im done here for now
[08:03:09] <johnline> http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/data/greetings2012/
[08:05:14] <hugo_moss> so theyre all computed basically
[08:05:21] <hugo_moss> computed != inherited
[08:05:25] <Eviltwin> Correct
[08:05:43] <hugo_moss> is there a guide somewhere like w3schools about how things are computed?
[08:06:05] <Eviltwin> http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp
[08:06:07] <Spikes> Guys, since 1.9 removes data('events') method, is there any alternative?
[08:06:13] <Eviltwin> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html
[08:06:24] <Eviltwin> Spikes: Why do you need to access .data('events')?
[08:06:46] <Spikes> Eviltwin, to get list of events bound to a certain element
[08:06:49] <johnkpaul> Spikes: there's a migrate plugin if you really need it
[08:07:09] <Spikes> Eviltwin, helpful in certain cases
[08:07:14] <Eviltwin> Like what cases?
[08:07:20] <Eviltwin> If it's for debugging that's one thing
[08:07:21] <Spikes> Eviltwin, is it important?
[08:07:32] <Eviltwin> If it's for a production library, it's a horrible practice
[08:07:37] <hugo_moss> thanks eviltwin
[08:08:02] <Spikes> Eviltwin, well, it's not the case
[08:08:16] <johnkpaul> Spikes: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-migrate-plugin
[08:08:35] <Spikes> johnkpaul, thanks, seen it, just wanted to make sure that there's no other way
[08:08:52] <kaylee> if I've got jquery triggering an alert when any element with a specific class is clicked… how can I figure out which type of elemenet was clicked?
[08:08:57] <johnkpaul> Spikes: there probably is, but that's the _supported_ way
[08:09:04] <andrew9184> hey guys, i'm looking for advice on writing a plugin.  i've written one and it contains alot of functions, and in the init, i'm just doing this.foobar(element, options) like several times for different functions.  is there a better way to do this ?
[08:09:30] <hugo_moss> eviltwin: so if i said a container is to have a width of 300px, the inner box including margin, border, padding, and content all equal 300px
[08:09:36] <Eviltwin> kaylee: this.type ?
[08:09:42] <Eviltwin> this.nodeName ?
[08:09:43] <kaylee> ah, thanks
[08:10:26] <kaylee> :/ $(this).type gives me undefined
[08:10:30] <Eviltwin> hugo_moss: These sort of questions are really out of the scope of #jquery
[08:10:38] <Eviltwin> kaylee: Didn't say $(this) :P
[08:10:41] <AQEEL> andrew9184:  http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[08:10:45] <Eviltwin> And you want .nodeName or .tagName
[08:10:53] <kaylee> oh
[08:11:23] <kaylee> shiny!
[08:11:24] <kaylee> thanks!
[08:11:54] <hugo_moss> <Eviltwin> But padding will cause it to be smaller than the width of its parent   <---- so when you said this, you mean padding of the inner boxes will cause the available widths to be smaller
[08:12:06] <andrew9184> AQEEL: I've read that many times already
[08:12:25] <AQEEL> then your plugin should be good to go
[08:12:26] <hugo_moss> oo i thought i was in css
[08:12:28] <hugo_moss> sorry
[08:12:32] <hugo_moss> are you in #css?
[08:12:35] <Eviltwin> No
[08:12:38] <hugo_moss> because i was just curious what you meant
[08:12:40] <kaylee> yay, that's working
[08:13:09] <AQEEL> that skeleton is really a huge help
[08:13:45] <kaylee> and I know this is a stupid question, but sometimes I get things a little confused
[08:13:53] <hugo_moss> do you mind if i message you eviltwin?
[08:14:16] <kaylee> if I've got a few different steps I want to do, but I want to make sure A is finished before B happens… how do I do that?
[08:15:04] <wroathe> kaylee: Can you be more specific?
[08:15:07] <andrew9184> in the init call of the plugin, is it normal to be calling other methods with this.  ie this.foo1() this.foo2() this.foo3() ?
[08:15:09] <Eviltwin> hugo_moss: I'd prefer if you didn't
[08:15:29] <wroathe> kaylee: If you want to ensure the sequential order of things in Javascript it's usually done with callbacks
[08:15:40] <kaylee> well, I'm having some difficulty getting google analytics events triggered
[08:15:57] <hugo_moss> oh
[08:15:58] <hugo_moss> ok
[08:16:08] <kaylee> would be really nice if I got some kind of feedback from the push
[08:16:11] <hugo_moss> sorry
[08:16:18] <computer2000> anyone pls help: i am currently loading scripts with ajax depending on which scripts are needed by the current page. is this a situation where i should start using require.js or some other modular js system?
[08:16:31] <wroathe> kaylee: can you post code? If something isn't working there's a good chance you have something wrong
[08:16:33] <kaylee> or at least something to let me know that it DID actually finish before I go to a new page
[08:16:55] <wroathe> kaylee: the .push just puts method calls on a stack that analytics uses after it finishes loading.
[08:16:58] <Eviltwin> hugo_moss: This might help: http://jsfiddle.net/7TzyR/
[08:17:54] <kaylee> http://pastebin.com/Y1TerCuc

[08:19:14] <wroathe> Eviltwin: I think your mother is just fine.
[08:19:54] <Eviltwin> How about we stay on topic
[08:20:29] <wroathe> Eviltwin: Speaking of topic, the topic says use jsfiddle.
[08:20:51] <Eviltwin> Well it's recommended
[08:20:51] <Eviltwin> ?paste
[08:20:52] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[08:21:20] <wroathe> Eviltwin: It's also recommended that we stay on topic :P
[08:21:27] <wroathe> Eviltwin: Doesn't mean it's required.
[08:21:47] <wroathe>  /troll

[08:22:08] <wroathe> Eviltwin: <3
[08:22:16] <firstclassfunc> is there a way to make jquery log all errors or other helpful info? or even when do $('someSelector') when it returns an empty array?

[08:24:42] <andrew9184> hi eviltwin !
[08:24:52] <Eviltwin> computer2000: require.js would probably be helpful
[08:25:17] <delinquentme> does anyone happen to have a jsperf running a number of different selectors? ... Just to see if say *= is faster than |= ?

[08:25:45] <hugo_moss> <Eviltwin> But padding will cause it to be smaller than the width of its parent <--
[08:25:52] <hugo_moss> oops
[08:25:53] <Eviltwin> hugo_moss: Dude...
[08:25:58] <computer2000> Eviltwin: i just dont get how to implement it for my needs... right now im just checking in a master script on what page i am and then loading the needed scripts dependent on that
[08:26:42] <hugo_moss> that statement doesnt make sense to me
[08:28:10] <wroathe> kaylee: kaylee https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/eventTrackerGuide
[08:28:39] <wroathe> delinquentme: http://jsperf.com/jqselectorstest
[08:29:34] <kaylee> yes, I've read through both of those and tried all of it
[08:29:37] <zfly9> hey guys can anyone tell me why goo.gl/SWgMY when you click on Free Case Evaluation, and it uses the jQuery anchor to slide down to the form, in IE9 (maybe lower too) the footer breaks, kind of hides behind the body of the page
[08:29:54] <kaylee> it would be REALLY nice if they had a FULL working example rather than a bunch of snippets
[08:30:11] <kaylee> I suspect I've got things ordered wrong or something
[08:30:26] <hugo_moss> eviltwin: only the inner boxes padding is affected by the width of the container, because the width only specifies the width of the content and not the border padding margin, so i dont understand what you were saying with that statement
[08:30:34] <Eviltwin> hugo_moss: Pretend I never said anything
[08:30:44] <NoiseEee> kaylee: does _gaq exist?  your debugger/console isn't complaining about anything?
[08:30:44] <Eviltwin> I clearly don't know what I'm talking about
[08:30:50] <Eviltwin> Ask in #css
[08:30:52] <hugo_moss> no no im not trying to say that
[08:30:58] <Eviltwin> No, I am
[08:31:04] <hugo_moss> its not true
[08:31:16] <hugo_moss> im just trying to understand what i meant
[08:31:22] <hugo_moss> i didnt mean to offend you
[08:31:26] <Eviltwin> I don't know what I meant
[08:31:37] <kaylee> NoiseEee: yes. _gaq is set up as provided copy/paste from the ga settings/config
[08:32:01] <kaylee> NoiseEee: with the code I pasted to fixee, no complaints to console in firebug
[08:32:13] <NoiseEee> kaylee: and what about when you tell firebug to break on all errors?
[08:32:23] <wroathe> kaylee: Can you post a link to the site you're working on?
[08:32:34] <wroathe> kaylee: I think NoiseEee is probably onto something
[08:33:39] <wroathe> kaylee: I see the problem
[08:33:43] <wroathe> https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/methods/gaJSApiEventTracking
[08:33:46] <wroathe> Look at opt_value
[08:33:47] <firstclassfunc> Eviltwin: ok, thanks.. what about a plugin that does this?
[08:34:10] <Eviltwin> firstclassfunc: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-lint/
[08:34:14] <kaylee> NoiseEee: that IS with break on all errors
[08:34:19] <kaylee> wroathe: no
[08:34:48] <wroathe> kaylee: The fourth argument needs to be an integer and not a string
[08:35:09] <kaylee> wroathe: I'm not providing a 4th argument
[08:35:13] <kaylee> it's optional
[08:35:26] <wroathe> kaylee: I'm silly
[08:35:29] <wroathe> kaylee: ignore me
[08:35:50] <firstclassfunc> Eviltwin: that seems to be what I'm looking for, thanks!
[08:36:01] <wroathe> kaylee: Actually
[08:36:16] <wroathe> kaylee: the documentation says that you need to pass undefined for the fourth param if you don't intend to use it
[08:36:35] <wroathe> kaylee: Wait, no it doesn't say that.
[08:36:38] <wroathe> kaylee: Ignore me again
[08:36:43] <kaylee> when I try _trackEvent rather than _gaq.push .. I get "_trackEvent is not defined"
[08:37:11] <zfly9> no one??
[08:41:19] <NoiseEee> kaylee: shouldn't your arguments be in different order?  https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/methods/gaJSApiEventTracking#_gat.GA_EventTracker_._trackEvent
[08:42:25] <kaylee> hum… maybe I need to have this function grab the tracker then push to it
[08:43:19] <kaylee> NoiseEee: shouldn't really matter which string I put in category, action or label, the're all strings
[08:43:31] <NoiseEee> kaylee: you have "click" as your first argument.
[08:43:34] <kaylee> I'm getting nothing in ga Events
[08:43:35] <NoiseEee> actually Click
[08:43:43] <NoiseEee> right because you're not tracking it properly
[08:44:14] <kaylee> still, string is a string
[08:44:24] <kaylee> how I choose to group them shouldn't matter
[08:44:31] <kaylee> and I have tried it with other strings
[08:44:53] <NoiseEee> kaylee: no, if you're trying to track clicks but not passing it in the correct order to the method, how can it track clicks?!
[08:45:40] <kaylee> does this make you happier?  _gaq.push('_trackEvent', 'mycategory', 'myaction', 'mylabel');
[08:45:55] <NoiseEee> yep
[08:46:01] <NoiseEee> with myaction being 'click'
[08:46:26] <kaylee> doesn't matter
[08:46:55] <kaylee> those are just labels, for grouping. as long as the person looking at the data knows what they represent, that's what matters
[08:47:15] <andrew9184> if i have two methods in a plugin that use a similar element, should i be declaring a global variable in the scope of the plugin and use that variable instead of defining it twice within each method ?
[08:47:29] <NoiseEee> kaylee: well then i'd probably take this to their support boards/forum.
[08:47:39] <kaylee> I have another idea
[08:47:49] <kaylee> may have a scope problem
[08:51:06] <slick-> I have a submit button for my form, and I'm doing event.preventDefault(); so I can make sure the person checked a radio button
[08:51:14] <slick-> if they  did, i wanna submit the form
[08:51:22] <slick-> how do i make it so that it submits the form
[08:51:23] <slick-> if its valid
[08:52:18] <zfly9> hey guys can anyone tell me why http://westvirginiaindustrialaccidentlawyer.com/contact/ when you click on Free Case Evaluation, and it uses the jQuery anchor to slide down to the form, in IE9 (maybe lower too) the footer breaks, kind of hides behind the body of the page
[08:59:57] <Saaether> zfly9 IE is reporting a error because it looks like you have some random code floating there doing nothing "(this).find("img")"
[09:00:02] <vlad_starkov> Question: is there better solution to mask input value besides http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin ?
[09:00:56] <trololozla> I currently have $(".slider-right").live('touch click',function()  what should I change, so it would only work on that .slider-right which is inside this id?
[09:02:23] <andrew9184> you should specify a context or a #id
[09:02:30] <andrew9184> selecting my class is expensive
[09:03:24] <catcher> My $.ajax() success handler is returning the time it took to get the data at the end of the string, hosing my data.  How do I tell it not to?
[09:05:21] <catcher> ah, nm
[09:05:23] <zfly9> Saaether, got rid of it, thanks...
[09:05:28] <zfly9> but still broke
[09:06:14] <AL13N_work> how can i close i dialog() i haven't opened yet?
[09:06:37] <AL13N_work> it's been created dynamically, but it doesn't need to be opened, so i'd like to close it
[09:06:57] <Saaether> zfly9 i just tried it in IE8 and it worked ok for me
[09:07:20] <zfly9> Hmm I'm trying in IE9 and nothing
[09:07:28] <zfly9> (well I mean it's still not working right)
[09:08:06] <Saaether> it scrolled down, it limited what i was able to enter, it submitted and redirected me to the thank you page
[09:08:11] <Saaether> is it supposed to do anything else?
[09:10:03] <zfly9> saaether, do you have IE9?
[09:10:17] <Saaether> i should, let me check my other vm's
[09:10:33] <rindolf> Hi all. http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/ - does anyone see any show stopping problems with the navigation menu here, as opposed to the one here - http://www.shlomifish.org/ ? Can I make it live on the main URL?
[09:10:39] <zfly9> Saaether, should I send you a pic?
[09:11:16] <Saaether> ok getting email error in IE9
[09:11:37] <Saaether> nvm
[09:11:43] <Saaether> had a extra period
[09:11:48] <Saaether> seems to work ok in IE9
[09:13:03] <zfly9> ok let me show u
[09:13:11] <zfly9> nothing to do w the contact form..
[09:14:53] <zfly9> http://imgur.com/lbNXT top is how it looks prior to the anchor slide, bottom is how it looks after
[09:15:02] <zfly9> it scrolls down, then once it hits, breaks like that
[09:16:44] <rideh> how do I limit the scope of a selector to inside of the $().each parent ?
[09:19:18] <rideh> i'm trying to sum  (cost x qty) for a number of rows. I select the rows with $('div.material').each   but when I  $('p.qty').text() i get all of the p.qty concatenated from the whole page.
[09:19:23] <zfly9> Saaether ^
[09:21:48] <rideh> nvm. i need to use .find
[09:24:32] <jrockjiggz> I have multiple <input type="text"> with same name, i'm disabling the last 2, but my POST is sending a blank one.. ideas?
[09:25:35] <jrockjiggz> oh nm.. it works
[09:25:36] <pachet> highly recommend not using duplicate names if you're using the form submit event to send the post data
[09:25:58] <Eviltwin> Well they all get passed
[09:26:15] <Eviltwin> It's a question of how the server deals with it
[09:29:01] <zfly9> Saaether figured it out
[09:29:59] <lanken> I need to call a variable in the "params" argument of $.animate
[09:31:22] <lanken> right now, I'm trying to use $(jquerypattern).animate({ background-color: data[data_key], }, 300 );

[09:31:57] <firstclassfunc> can jquery create a JSON string from an object or must I look elsehwere?
[09:32:33] <NoiseEee> JSON.stringify(
[09:32:58] <kaylee> NoiseEee: motherfucker!
[09:33:07] * kaylee grumbles
[09:33:18] <NoiseEee> whatup kaylee, what was the deal
[09:33:24] <kaylee> in viewing the events, I forgot to update the date span
[09:33:32] * NoiseEee throws a tomato at kaylee
[09:33:35] <firstclassfunc> NoiseEee: yeah I use that, but I like to support all browsers even IE7
[09:33:39] <kaylee> the events pushed with the category "Click" WORKED!
[09:35:49] <kaylee> *grumble grumble*
[09:36:02] <kaylee> so many things have changed since then I'm not entirely sure what was missing
[09:36:08] <kaylee> or rather what I've changed sincethen
[09:36:50] <lxsameer> is it possible to add some function to onload event of "document" from inside of a different function ?
[09:39:27] <firstclassfunc> NoiseEee: hmm, I can use JSON.stringify in firebug but can't use it in my JS code. Why is that?
[09:39:56] <firstclassfunc> hm, one second
[09:40:19] <firstclassfunc> nevermind
[09:48:45] <kaylee> OOOOH HOW I LOVE EDITOR HISTORY!!!!!!!
[09:49:07] <obert> kaylee: then you missed svc tools
[09:50:14] <kaylee> obert: don't usually commit broken shit
[09:50:47] <obert> svc history is much more powerfull than editor undo;)
[09:52:26] <saml> how can I submit a form that's cross domain.. that requires basic authentication?
[09:53:23] <kaylee> in this instance, I'm content with what I have
[09:53:48] <obert> :)
[09:54:21] <obert> do you know how to check ctrl++ zooming browser beauvier?
[09:54:30] <obert> maybe there's a js that i misse
[10:08:41] <VictorCL> someimtes when I send text on ajax , it adds the folloginw text " jquery17349239234234_2342"

[10:09:18] <NoiseEee> its cache-breaking
[10:25:58] <Krisostoomus> Hello!
[10:26:20] <Krisostoomus> Anyone knows how to disable some table row sorting in tablesorter?
[10:26:48] <Krisostoomus> I have in that row data of totals.
[10:28:38] <VIctorCL23> hi i have some trouble for some time t hat I cant be able to fix
[10:29:13] <VIctorCL23> when I send some text with ajax it adds this text : jQuery17038233554447289575_1344253048575? to the end of the string
[10:29:30] <VIctorCL23> it only happens to some people , I am not able to reproduce this behaviour ..
[10:33:25] <Rovak> i just made a first attempt at creating a jQuery plugin, i could use some comments on how to improve the code https://github.com/Rovak/InlineAttachment
[10:35:10] <pachet> Rovak: always safer to break out the return to a new line
[10:35:16] <pachet> you're not sure this will expose .each
[10:36:00] <pachet> $.fn.foo = function ( params ) { var set = $(this); set.each(---> do stuff); return this; };
[10:36:08] <pachet> that way you offload the hassle of ducktyping onto $
[10:37:51] <Rovak> thanks, gonna fix that
[10:39:46] <Rovak> hmm, placing the $this variable outside the .each scope now fires the event on every textarea on the page
[10:40:37] <Rovak> pachet: like this https://gist.github.com/4330725?
[10:42:24] <delinquentme> is there a method I can call on an object to check if its undefined?
[10:42:35] <delinquentme> something like arr[0].nil?     and get "true"
[10:42:58] <pachet> um, if it's undefined, it won't be an object
[10:43:06] <Rovak> typeof variablename == "undefined"
[10:43:07] <pachet> if ( typeof foo.bar === 'undefined' ) {
[10:43:09] <pachet> ^
[10:43:52] <Rovak> pachet: i changed the gist, it works now, is this the way you suggested?
[10:47:02] <pachet> Rovak: https://gist.github.com/4330765
[10:47:27] <pachet> i'm just saying that letting jquery do your ducktyping is a win-win
[10:48:33] <Rovak> ah thanks :)

[10:54:04] <Bilupto> Problem related to Jquery mobile theme: Hello I am using jquery mobile version 1.1.1. For my application, I am using jquery mobile themeroller for colors and look. But I am having some problem. When I am using the theme, there are some kind of underline for checkbox and Text area, but not for other input types. Here is the picture: http://i48.tinypic.com/11scc2w.png
[10:54:27] <Bilupto> I am new to jquery. So I need help on this issue.
[10:54:58] <snowfox_ben> For some reason jQuery Validate is throwing this error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'settings' of undefined" when there are multiple forms on the same page. See our live site: http://aahom.org/support/donations
[10:55:11] <snowfox_ben> Same code works fine here: http://aahom.org/support/donations/operating-support
[10:58:26] <wachpwnski> how do I get the content length of an ajax header?
[10:59:14] <wachpwnski> or an ajax repsonse?
[10:59:23] <wachpwnski> I am getting truncated response values
[10:59:31] <BillCriswell> snowfox_ben: Does jQuery.validate run on all forms automatically?
[10:59:41] <snowfox_ben> I have it doing so
[10:59:52] <snowfox_ben> $("form").validate();
[11:00:15] <BillCriswell> snowfox_ben: Where is that line and is there anything else in there?
[11:00:57] <snowfox_ben> http://aahom.org/sites/all/themes/aahom/scripts/functions.js?mf10db
[11:02:08] <snowfox_ben> a couple import lines...
[11:02:47] <snowfox_ben> jQuery.validator …. Is used later to check for currency format, basically.
[11:02:59] <snowfox_ben> Then $("form").validate();
[11:03:33] <snowfox_ben> That validation is working on the first form on that page
[11:03:54] <snowfox_ben> but, not the second and third. and then I am getting the error in the js console
[11:07:20] <BillCriswell> snowfox_ben: What if the forms don't share the same name? Same error?
[11:07:37] <snowfox_ben> Good question, I can test that now
[11:07:53] <snowfox_ben> they oddly enough all have the same ID…which makes no sense to me and is not in the markup...
[11:07:56] <scar> how can i use preventDefault() for when someone SUBMITS a form? i prevented default upon the actual submit button, but if someone is in a textbox and they hit ENTER, it will submit the form. is there an action for this?
[11:08:37] <BillCriswell> snowfox_ben: Yeah, that's not exactly legal in the HTML world.
[11:08:42] <snowfox_ben> I know.
[11:08:57] <BillCriswell> Dang internets. =(
[11:09:01] <snowfox_ben> I will try the name thing first, because I see that in the markup
[11:09:18] <supsup> you hack the EEPROM yet got pi ready.
[11:09:21] <snowfox_ben> the ID…I think that is the third-party donations tool they are using, that is awful
[11:10:44] <BillCriswell> That's never any fun.
[11:11:03] <scar> nevermind, found it
[11:11:10] <scar> .submit() returning false;
[11:11:20] <katsh> how can i use xpath to search for every div with a pattern in it? the equivalent of '[class*=editable-text]'
[11:11:54] <goddard> i have a css drop down menu and a set of jquery tabs.  My drop down menu always pops under my tabs
[11:11:55] <snowfox_ben> BillCriswell: I changed the name and the ID changed to match…but the error still shows up
[11:11:59] <goddard> how can i have them pop on top?
[11:12:15] <snowfox_ben> If I remove the other two forms from the page, the error goes away
[11:13:03] <Saaether> goddard you need to set the z-index on your menu to be higher then the tabs
[11:13:22] <Krisostoomus> Why don't I have icons in jquery tablesorter?
[11:13:32] <hye> I am migrating from server side html procesing to front-end javascript processing of html, via Json data feeds and etc... before I would render the html in the server side, now I use JSon data to create the html in client side... is there any major problems I might face?  Other then leaking my entire data sets to client?
[11:14:35] <goddard> Saaether: i set it to like 9999999999 and it still pops under
[11:15:45] <Saaether> goddard try setting position:relative on your menu
[11:15:51] <goddard> ok
[11:16:37] <BillCriswell> snowfox_ben: Hmm, not sure what the issue is then.
[11:17:27] <snowfox_ben> BillCriswell: Dang.
[11:20:35] <Krisostoomus> Why is my tablesorter not working??
[11:20:46] <BillCriswell> snowfox_ben: What if you do $('form').each(function(e) $(this).validate(); }); instead of $('form').validate(); ?
[11:23:24] <snowfox_ben> OoOO!
[11:23:35] <snowfox_ben> Error gone.
[11:23:40] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeeeeet.
[11:23:58] <BillCriswell> I'd expect the way you originally approached it to work, kind of weird it didn't.
[11:24:23] <snowfox_ben> Thanks BillCriswell
[11:24:27] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[11:24:30] <snowfox_ben> You want a coffee? :)
[11:24:39] <BillCriswell> No thanks, never touched the stuff!
[11:24:47] <snowfox_ben> gasp!
[11:25:21] <BillCriswell> I know! I do appreciate the offer, though.
[11:25:24] <snowfox_ben> I gotta wrap up one last component to this form, but don't go anywhere….(unless you have to)
[11:25:57] <BillCriswell> haha I'll be around I'm sure.
[11:28:17] <rindolf> Krisostoomus: hi.
[11:28:24] <rindolf> Krisostoomus: where can we find it?
[11:28:34] <rindolf> Krisostoomus: if you want, you can use jsFiddle.
[11:28:46] <rindolf> Krisostoomus: and there's a jQuery plugin for it I think.
[11:35:11] <snowfox_ben> Final piece…i want to run this function when the form is not form[name="donate"]
[11:35:13] <snowfox_ben> $('form input[name="submit"]').click(function (e) { .. }
[11:35:26] <snowfox_ben> Do I use .not()?
[11:35:51] <BillCriswell> snowfox_ben: $('form:not([name=donate]').submit(function(e){}); might be your safest bet.
[11:36:09] <snowfox_ben> ahh, that is what I was goofing with…but had it wrong
[11:36:09] <BillCriswell> Since a form can be submitted without you clicked the submit button.
[11:36:19] <BillCriswell> without you clicking*
[11:36:23] <snowfox_ben> ahhh
[11:36:26] <snowfox_ben> Good point too
[11:36:27] <snowfox_ben> Hmm
[11:36:30] <snowfox_ben> Dang! Thanks
[11:36:34] <BillCriswell> Welcome!

Here is the picture: http://i48.tinypic.com/11scc2w.png. Need Help.
[11:58:09] <kegster> im trying to use ajax and progressbar, but is there any way to maybe set a cookie to store the progressbar value since i cannot access session data via js?
[12:01:05] <BillCriswell> veQue: Awesome read.
[12:01:10] <matip> Hello guys
[12:01:17] <CIDIC> in jqmobile does it call document.ready multiple times? I am trying to use backbone.js with query mobile and it seems to do that.
[12:01:37] <veQue> BillCriswell: agreed
[12:01:58] <BillCriswell> I always find myself caught up in shit no one will notice but me.
[12:02:52] <matip> Using .animate() I have to change the left property of two elements and when it's done, I execute a function to complete the transition
[12:02:53] <matip> the code is something like that:   elem1.animate(...); elem2.animate(...., function...)
[12:03:08] <BillCriswell> veQue: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis pretty much describes me.
[12:03:17] <matip> the problem is that the first element starts the transition some ms earlier than the second
[12:03:24] <matip> and i'ts noticeable
[12:03:44] <veQue> same here
[12:03:45] <matip> is there any way to do something like          [elem1, elem2].animate(..., function() {...})
[12:03:50] <matip> ?
[12:05:09] <jeremy-> Does anybody know how to parse/display the bson object _id using jquery (so i can store it in a datatable for later use).
[12:05:28] <jeremy-> I've found jQuery.parseJSON but I'm still a little confused how to use it
[12:05:43] <jtm> what's the best way to hide an element if there is a click outside of it?
[12:07:16] <matip> any idea guys?
[12:08:52] <kegster> if im using ajax to run a process.. and that process sets session var at increments so another ajax call can check the session var--- that seems really inefficient. is this a recommended way?
[12:08:56] <jeremy-> Nevermind, by sheer luck i realised datatables already uses a parsejson like plugin and i could automagically get nested bson objects by referencing the identifier ($id)
[12:09:31] <CIDIC> in jqmobile does it call document.ready multiple times? I am trying to use backbone.js with query mobile and it seems to do that.
[12:13:56] <zoned> anyone here ever used isotope?
[12:14:14] <zoned> or masonry
[12:14:29] <BillCriswell> zoned: I've looked at it... a lot. Never used it for anything though lol
[12:14:34] <BillCriswell> zoned: What's the questions?
[12:15:49] <zoned> so i've got everything set up and working correctly. but let's say one column has 3 "blocks" and one only has 2. since each block has padding, this makes the height of the two columns different. how do you solve this?
[12:16:32] <zoned> assume that the the column with two blocks has a large block which is 2x the height
[12:16:47] <zoned> so if there was no padding, the heights would be equal.
[12:18:02] <BillCriswell> zoned: Why are you concerned about the heights of the columns individually? Are you trying to put content under it or do you just want the columns to be equal height for another reason?
[12:18:24] <zoned> BillCriswell: my layout is 100% height, so it's purely horizontal.
[12:19:36] <BillCriswell> I think I'd need to see an example in front of me to understand the situation better.
[12:24:13] <zoned> BillCriswell: http://ge.tt/6X7AsoT/v/0?c
[12:25:16] <zoned> see how the total height of the two columns is 300px, but because of the extra box there is more padding in column 1, thus increasing column 1's total height.
[12:26:57] <greengriminal> Can someone please explain why my jquery dialog may not be working: https://gist.github.com/4331630 I am simply trying to get it to open when I click on the table cells.
[12:27:40] <zoned> i could write some JS to go through and figure out that you need to decrease the padding in column 1 by 33% or increase column 2's by 50%, but that sounds rather difficult, and i sense that i must be doing something wrong, and this shouldn't be a problem?
[12:30:11] <BillCriswell> zoned: I don't believe it's built to behave like that. There's really no "columns" with masonry. It' just absolutely positioned divs so I'm not sure how you'd handle that.
[12:31:09] <zoned> I keep thinking there's probably a built in option to do padding (and then this is handled by the plugin), but I just can't figure it out.
[12:31:19] <BillCriswell> zoned: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/layout-modes.html maybe masonryHorizontal ?
[12:31:27] <zoned> BillCriswell:  I am using masonryHorizonta;
[12:32:06] <BillCriswell> Did any of the other layout modes get you close?
[12:32:10] <itatitat> guys I'm suffering a redirect even using  preventDefault when  I make click in a submit button, my code is this: https://gist.github.com/4331688
[12:33:35] <BillCriswell> itatitat: You want the submit event on the form, not the submit button.
[12:34:12] <itatitat> mmmmmmmmmmmmm, I dont understand...
[12:34:33] <itatitat> how would be it?
[12:35:01] <BillCriswell> itatitat: Right now you have a submit event on an input element. You want the submit even on the form element.
[12:35:17] <itatitat> ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuUUUU!, right
[12:35:25] <itatitat> now I understand, yes!
[12:35:33] <itatitat> thanks a lot
[12:35:37] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:35:45] <zoned> BillCriswell: masonryHorizontal is the only one that works for my design, because I want to scroll horizontally only
[12:35:52] <Comartin> i need help with my validate function, http://jsfiddle.net/williamcomartin/M6vGb/14/
[12:36:06] <Comartin> its not returning any errors or doing anything at all
[12:36:16] <Comartin> can anybody spot something i cant.
[12:37:19] <BillCriswell> zoned: I think the way you mentioned is the only way to get it how you'd want it. If the heights of the items are going to be different it's going to get tricky.
[12:37:44] <zoned> BillCriswell: the heights of the items aren't different though
[12:38:06] <zoned> 100+100+100 = 200+100 … it's the padding that makes the difference, because you have 2 paddings vs 3 paddings
[12:38:32] <zoned> and i find it odd that isotope wouldn't include a way to do padding anyway? who wants all their blocks lined up
[12:41:26] <BillCriswell> zoned: I think the way you said is the only way to get it. You'll need to check the offsets to figure out "column height" and adjust it based on that.
[12:43:26] <fission6> how can i get an object representing form data?
[12:43:37] <BillCriswell> fission6: serializeArray()
[12:44:16] <fission6> ok thanks
[12:44:34] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[12:45:42] <shoky> zoned: i've never used isotope/masonry and no idea if this will help, but if the issue is just a css one, maybe box-sizing: border-box  would help?
[12:45:50] <fission6> any reason why that snot a map structure BillCriswell
[12:45:54] <fission6> its just name and value
[12:45:58] <scar> what is a _safe_, or conventional minimum miliseconds for a setInterval() ?
[12:46:19] <scar> oops thats javascript huh
[12:47:13] <BillCriswell> fission6: Did you want something like [{ "age":"28" },{ "eyes":"Brown"}] ?
[12:47:25] <fission6> uh huh
[12:47:47] <fission6> well tighouth the outer list
[12:47:50] <fission6> array
[12:48:21] <BillCriswell> I think you'd have to create that on your own.
[12:50:19] <zoned> shoky: not a bad idea, i'll find out what happens!
[12:51:42] <manou> hello, I have a js code between $().ready(function(){...}; one is a click event handler for a class, and elements with this class are created by ajax as return html code. The problem is this click is not handle, I need to return the click event code with the html returned code ... can i solve this situation ?
[12:52:14] <shoky> manou: use event delegation with .on()
[12:52:19] <shoky> ?on @ manou
[12:52:20] <bot-t> manou, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:53:03] <shoky> manou: for example  $('#staticContainer').on('click', '.someClass', function() { ... })
[12:54:48] <manou> this is not working 		$(".remove_tag").on("click", function(){
[12:54:48] <manou> 			alert( 'hola' );
[12:54:48] <manou> 		});
[12:55:04] <fission6> how would i select all radio inputs which are selected and that have a name like 'question-*'
[12:55:20] <shoky> manou: right, read about "Event Delegation" at the docs for "on"
[12:55:27] <shoky> manou: and look at my example.
[12:55:36] <BillCriswell> $('input[type=radio][name^=question]') fission6.
[12:56:03] <shoky> manou:  for example..  $('body').on('click', '.remove_tag', function() { alert('hola') })
[12:56:06] <manou> the element that fires the click is identified by a class, not a container
[12:56:20] <shoky> manou: the class is also there, but not in the $(...)
[12:56:33] <shoky> manou: in the $(...) you need to put an element that already exists when the page is loaded
[12:56:46] <shoky> manou: an eleemnt that contains .remove_tag elemetns
[12:56:46] <fission6> BillCriswell: thats close, that selects all them not the ones which were selected (clicked on by the user)
[12:57:03] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[12:57:07] <manou> yeap, got it... thanks
[12:57:15] <BillCriswell> $('input[type=radio][name^=question]:checked') maybe?
[12:57:40] <fission6> find('input[type=radio][name^=question]:checked')
[12:57:41] <fission6> yep
[12:57:52] <shoky> ?:radio
[12:57:52] <bot-t> :radio: Selects all elements of type radio. http://api.jquery.com/radio-selector/
[12:57:53] <shoky> ;p
[12:58:42] <BillCriswell> :radio[name^=question-]:checked ?! lol
[12:58:56] <BillCriswell> SO many different ways. That's a good thing though I'm sure.
[13:03:20] <BillCriswell> fission6: http://jsbin.com/ikifeg/1/edit  might be what you want for the serialize issue? Not sure if there's a better way to do that... probably, though.
[13:04:01] <fulminator> hello, can I get some help please on this: http://jsfiddle.net/tTLB9/3/ I am trying to save numeric input from a textbox in an array that will be added to localStorage, but only the last numbers are store. What I am missing? And how to access that array later in code?
[13:05:08] <rindolf> fulminator: did you serialise it to JSON?
[13:05:17] <fulminator> it is working if I change = to += in the line: localStorage['booksBought'] += booksBought;
[13:05:35] <fulminator> yes, but I delete the code with serialise for simplicity of snippet
[13:05:43] <fulminator> that is not important in my question
[13:06:03] <fission6> yep ended up with something quite close thanks BillCriswell will post some code for review when all done
[13:06:04] <karolyi> fulminator: why do you use booksBought[lsLen] and then booksBought?
[13:06:12] <rindolf> fulminator: you should use booksBought.append or something.
[13:06:29] <rindolf> fulminator: lsLen is the localStorage length, not the array's.
[13:06:40] <rindolf> karolyi: hi, again.
[13:06:47] <karolyi> rindolf: ohai
[13:07:40] <fulminator> yes, lsLen is localStorage length. and the key for my array. Every time the user click, lsLen updates, and so array[lsLen] is ready to receive a new data
[13:07:50] <fulminator> oh, wait, it should be lsLen+1
[13:08:36] <karolyi> fulminator: your code does not make much sense to me now
[13:09:31] <karolyi> fulminator: if you'd like to append your new value to the booksBought variable, and booksBought is an array, then you should simply use booksBought.push()
[13:11:00] <rindolf> karolyi: what's up?
[13:11:16] <karolyi> fulminator: also, localStorage won't have a lengths, since it is a string indexed array a.k.a. object
[13:11:27] <karolyi> -s
[13:11:36] <kripster> doppey question, but what is the correct way to position a button, jquery or css??
[13:11:59] <karolyi> kripster: huh?
[13:12:09] <karolyi> rindolf: the sky?
[13:12:48] <kripster> as in, if i want to move the search button to the right of the screen do i use css styling or jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/UmPz7/
[13:13:30] <karolyi> kripster: i suggest float:right
[13:13:32] <rindolf> karolyi: http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-fact-chuck-35
[13:14:11] <karolyi> rindolf: hah you just created that
[13:14:36] <fulminator> karolyi: I have tried with .push(), makes sense this way, however now the codes doesnt works: here is update: http://jsfiddle.net/tTLB9/4/
[13:15:09] <karolyi> fulminator: booksBought.push($('#txtNr').val())
[13:15:45] <kripster> so if i have set my class on the button to  class="ui-btn-right why is it not on the right handside of screen?
[13:16:03] <fulminator> oh, I see
[13:16:14] <fulminator> gee, thank, it's working perfectly!!!!
[13:16:25] <fulminator> :D:D many thanks karolyi
[13:17:02] <karolyi> kripster: do you have a .ui-btn-right css selector?
[13:18:52] <kripster> yeah got it thx
[13:19:17] <fulminator> kripster are you building a phonegap app?
[13:19:36] <kripster> nope, y?
[13:19:54] <fulminator> because you are using jquery.mobile
[13:20:58] <rindolf> karolyi: no, not just now.
[13:21:03] <rindolf> karolyi: a while ago.
[13:21:34] <karolyi> rindolf: right after fixing your jqtree? :)
[13:21:45] <TelFiRE> What's the best way to get a simple slide-toggle in mobile? slidetoggle itself (or animate) with jQuery just doesn't perform at all... CSS doesn't support going between "auto" and 0, and I'm afraid to load a whole library like jqmobi or something just for two slidetoggles but wondering if that's how I should indeed do it
[13:23:29] <karolyi> TelFiRE: 'a whole library' is sometimes just a jquery widget, do have no fear to load them, when css animation is not enough for you
[13:23:39] <karolyi> s/do/so/
[13:23:55] <TelFiRE> so for that particular case do you know of such a widget that works well?
[13:24:39] <karolyi> TelFiRE: actually haven't developed with jqmobile for a while, but back then i used the one from the builtins
[13:25:25] <TelFiRE> Oh ok thought you were saying like a jquery.mobiletoggle.min.js or something like that which wouldn't use mobi. Ok well I guess I will delve into the mobile library and see how it works
[13:26:24] <acidjazz> man this is the weirdest behavior
[13:26:32] <acidjazz> i resized a bunch of divs in jquery
[13:26:43] <acidjazz> and even in console.log I keep getting the original size
[13:26:57] <rindolf> karolyi: no, way before. ;-)
[13:27:18] <rindolf> karolyi: maybe we should share some more jokes about Chuck Norris and jQuery.
[13:27:25] <karolyi> ?demo @acidjazz
[13:27:26] <bot-t> acidjazz, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:27:40] <kripster> has anyone used phonegap for developing mobile apps, is it any gd?
[13:27:53] <rindolf> “Chuck Norris can write valid jQuery programs in one character. And they work”
[13:28:08] <rindolf> Well, it's not too good.
[13:28:52] <karolyi> rindolf: try harder
[13:29:04] <rindolf> karolyi: well, I'm  not in the mood.
[13:29:52] <Wolf_22> I'm not sure if I'm asking the right question here, so bear with me... When you bind a click event to an element, is that the same as using <element>.click(function(){...} and if so, why would you have to bind a click event anyway?
[13:30:21] <NoiseEee> Wolf_22: for the most part, its the same in that you are assigning a handler when an event occurs
[13:30:24] <karolyi> rindolf: google is your friend: http://benalman.com/news/2009/12/john-resig-javascripts-chuck-norris/
[13:30:49] <NoiseEee> Wolf_22: inline JS is a bad idea because it confuses markup and behaviour; we want to separate that in the same way we ditched <font> tags and now use CSS files
[13:31:08] <NoiseEee> Wolf_22: also, assigning events properly lets you add handlers without overwriting existing ones
[13:31:38] <fulminator> guys, how I get an array from a saved in localStorage array? var arr = split(JSON.parse(localStorage['booksBought'])); It doesnt works this line please help
[13:32:10] <kripster> any ideas how i can style the following button to mimic clicking it? http://jsfiddle.net/UmPz7/6/
[13:33:21] <karolyi> fulminator: what exactly do you want to achieve?
[13:33:46] <Wolf_22> NoiseSee: So it really just boils down to preferred syntax?
[13:33:55] <DoctorMonocular> hey everyone! Per the advice of wroath here yesterday I switched out some custom code for the cycle plugin to make my "gallery" work. It was a little trickyt to make it all work with the way I'm displaying stuff. Now I have one more detail I need to figure out. First, here's the page: http://art.petermichaud.com -- now, if you expand the window to be very large (bigger than 1920 wide) what SHOULD happen is that the image
[13:33:55] <DoctorMonocular> should stretch to fill the window (maintaining the aspect ratio). That used to work, but cycle puts a width and height directly on the gallery element, so it's set to 1920px max, which isn't what I want at all. I can't figure out how to change it without hacking the plugin though, and I'd like to avoid that. Any help?
[13:34:16] <karolyi> kripster: add a :hover, :active and so on, see jquery ui's button styles
[13:34:30] <Wolf_22> NoiseSee: Because there's been instances where I tried to do something like element.click() or whatever but found out later that I needed to use element.bind('click'... instead.
[13:35:01] <fulminator> karolyi: I am having booksBought saved in localStorage. it's an array JSON.stringify. Now I want to loop trough that array in localStorage
[13:35:24] <fulminator> so I tought put it in an array and use a for loop will be ok
[13:35:52] <karolyi> Wolf_22: element.click() and element.bind('click' is the same, however element.bind is deprecated, element.on is the new flavour
[13:36:20] <karolyi> fulminator: but why do you need to stringify it?
[13:36:34] <lanken> is there a .foreach method for hashmap objects?
[13:36:41] <Wolf_22> karolyi: Ah, I see. I guess we all have to keep up with the Joneses then. :.) Thanks for the insight.
[13:36:59] <fulminator> karolyi: http://jsfiddle.net/tTLB9/5/
[13:37:38] <fulminator> no, strinify is not needed. it's a number array actually.
[13:38:20] <karolyi> lanken: i don't know any hashmap object in javascript, maybe you mean objects?
[13:38:43] <lanken> karolyi: yes, I mean objects.
[13:38:57] <karolyi> lanken: there's Object.keys() for you
[13:39:49] <karolyi> fulminator: that's what i told you earlier. since localStorage is an object, is has no .length
[13:40:08] <karolyi> lanken: or you can use foreach on objects too
[13:40:27] <oojacoboo> what's too large of a json set?
[13:40:35] <oojacoboo> for the browser to handle
[13:40:41] <karolyi> lanken: for (key in object) {}
[13:41:20] <karolyi> oojacoboo: depends on key/value sizes, but i'd say thousends of key/value pairs in an object notes a bad structure
[13:41:36] <karolyi> *thousands
[13:41:40] <oojacoboo> mm
[13:41:41] <fulminator> can someone help me please on getting data from localStorage array here: http://jsfiddle.net/tTLB9/6/
[13:43:58] <karolyi> fulminator: are you listening to me ?
[13:46:21] <fulminator> yes, I am trying
[13:46:54] <fulminator> I can't figure it out how can I access a single item in localStorage
[13:47:36] <karolyi> fulminator: like i said, there's no localStorage[2]
[13:47:52] <karolyi> fulminator: just like there's no localStoragel.length
[13:48:41] <fulminator> but I am not trying to access localStorage2, I am trying to access localStorage['booksBought'][1]
[13:49:06] <fulminator> i.e. the firsth item from booksBought array
[13:49:13] <karolyi> fulminator: then why don't you just write localStorage['booksBought'][1] ?
[13:51:31] <fulminator> because it is not working?
[13:53:11] <karolyi> fulminator: i don't see any reason why it shouldn't
[13:53:40] <fulminator> I swear.
[13:53:46] <fulminator> you try it on jsfiddle
[13:54:37] <karolyi> fulminator: this is the third time i'm telling you: localStorage _DOES_NOT_HAVE_ an .length property
[13:56:36] <fulminator> ok, it doesnt have a length property
[13:56:45] <fulminator> but then, how to access a specific item?
[13:57:30] <karolyi> fulminator: like i told you. if you know the keys name, then simply write it like you did
[13:58:04] <fulminator> booksBought is = [1, 2, 3]
[13:58:14] <fulminator> how can I access item no 2?
[13:58:36] <fulminator> I'm sorry, I just don't understand localStorage
[13:58:48] <karolyi> fulminator: booksBought[1]
[13:59:31] <fulminator> in code please?
[14:00:07] <karolyi> fulminator: that's the code. the second element from the array booksBought is booksBought[1]
[14:00:14] <fulminator> I have found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3138564/looping-through-localstorage-in-html5-and-javascript :D
[14:00:29] <fulminator> this is what I acctually wanted
[14:00:52] <fulminator> to loop trough localStore like it is an array
[14:03:01] <karolyi> fulminator: ah, wait
[14:03:18] <DoctorMonocular> ok, maybe you guys can help with something easier.  I've set the slides and container to NOT resize, which is good. However, it's setting my container to about 50% larger than the width of my slides, and I have no idea why.  I can't even see where that wdith would be set, or any reason that it would be expanded that wide from its contents? #art_frame is the element in question: http://art.petermichaud.com/#about
[14:03:57] <karolyi> fulminator: loop though it as it would have been an object: for (key in localStorage) {}
[14:04:03] <karolyi> *through
[14:05:18] <BillCriswell> Maybe no the best place to ask, but do any of you use Chrome's developer tools? I keep doing stylesheet changes in it but I keep clicking links like an idiot and losing my styles. Is there a way to get reload my edits?
[14:06:11] <karolyi> BillCriswell: make your changes, then select them and copypaste to your css files, that's what i do
[14:06:35] <MistuhKurtz> yeah, one thing I really wish chrome dev tools would do is open links in a new tab when you middle-click or ctrl+click
[14:06:37] <karolyi> DoctorMonocular: where should i see the problem? i son't see any unwanted scrolling
[14:06:37] <BillCriswell> karolyi: Damn. The answer I didn't want. =(
[14:06:40] <MistuhKurtz> like firebug does
[14:07:06] <MistuhKurtz> I just end up doing right click -> open in new tab all the time
[14:07:08] <fulminator> ty god, karolyi, I just made my self understood. :)
[14:07:45] <karolyi> MistuhKurtz: chrome does open links in a new tab when you open them with middle click or ctrl-click (or command-click in OSX)
[14:08:04] <Brodingo> you can save changes your make in dev tools
[14:08:05] <Brodingo> somehow
[14:08:29] <kripster> could someone let me know how to override a jquery form background to an image background, i thought this would work but no luck
[14:08:38] <karolyi> MistuhKurtz: the problem is, how would chrome save your changes if you're editing a remote sites stylesheet?
[14:08:52] <BillCriswell> MistuhKurtz: Hmm... $('a').attr('target', function(){ return "_blank"; }); might be in my future lol.
[14:08:55] <MistuhKurtz> I'm not trying to accomplish that
[14:08:59] <kripster> .ui-page {
[14:08:59] <kripster>     background-image:url([Wallpaper.png]);
[14:08:59] <kripster>     background-repeat: repeat;
[14:08:59] <kripster> }
[14:09:18] <MistuhKurtz> yeah it does open them up in a new tab in sources tab
[14:09:34] <MistuhKurtz> for some reason I've always preferred opening it new a new browser tab, i guess there's just more room
[14:09:35] <NoiseEee> kripster: whats with the [] ?
[14:09:37] <karolyi> kripster: don't use [] brackets
[14:09:54] <MistuhKurtz> use single- or double-quotes instead
[14:10:12] <karolyi> quotes aren't even needed
[14:11:15] <karolyi> MistuhKurtz: if you'd like to have more place, you can pop out the developer plugin
[14:11:22] <kripster> .ui-page {
[14:11:22] <kripster>     background-image:url(CSS\Images\Wallpaper.png);
[14:11:22] <kripster>     background-repeat: repeat;
[14:11:22] <kripster> } this stil doesnt work
[14:11:42] <karolyi> kripster: use slashes instead of backslashes
[14:13:30] <kripster> nope still nothing
[14:13:40] <DoctorMonocular> karolyi -- the issue is that the images are almost twice the size they should be, they are set to  min-width of 100% and their container is way larger than they are AND way larger than the screen itself. The container should always we exactly the same width as the screen
[14:13:55] <karolyi> kripster: then you might have mistyped your image path, this should work
[14:14:28] <b-ot> mwahahaha
[14:15:09] <fulminator> karolyi: localStorage isn't persistent? if I reload my page, localStorage resets?
[14:16:09] <karolyi> DoctorMonocular: ah, i see now. wait, i already had the same problem fixed once
[14:16:44] <DoctorMonocular> yay 8)
[14:17:21] <karolyi> fulminator: it should be persistent, however not every browser supports local storage. see http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage
[14:17:39] <karolyi> DoctorMonocular: nice pictures btw
[14:18:40] <fission6> i have the following, http://dpaste.org/f81fB/ when the user selects a radio i want to enable the button at the bottom, what select can i use on the input change() handler
[14:21:23] <fulminator> karolyi: http://jsfiddle.net/tTLB9/7/ the same runs in the browser moz 17. When I refresh the page, localStorage get empty. Am I missing something here? Please reply
[14:22:51] <NoiseEee> fission6: click
[14:23:25] <fission6> huh?
[14:24:18] <NoiseEee> find the event, then get the closest div, and find the first <a> fission6
[14:24:46] <DoctorMonocular> thanks karolyi! Any luck on the container width?
[14:26:03] <fission6> ok
[14:26:38] <karolyi> DoctorMonocular: bad news, if you want to resize your picture keeping the aspect ratio, you're going to need JS code implemented on it
[14:27:27] <DoctorMonocular> karolyi it already works great if the container is the correct size though?
[14:27:55] <karolyi> fulminator: please wait
[14:29:22] <karolyi> DoctorMonocular: it will work if you have the container sized correctly but think on the fact that not every user has the same desktop resolution, so your nice pictures might get resized in a way that either on the right side, or the bottom side will have empty space left
[14:30:32] <karolyi> DoctorMonocular: you can have width:100% and height:auto, so the aspect ratio of the picture remains the same, but what if the height of the viewport is so tall that you picture won't fit vertically?
[14:30:43] <karolyi> *your
[14:31:45] <DoctorMonocular> karolyi, maybe I'm not being clear enough, let me explain. Before I was using cycle I had it working fine with some css magic. That css magic is still in place and works great. However, it works because the image tracks the size of its container
[14:31:56] <DoctorMonocular> generally the container is 100% of the width of the window
[14:32:11] <DoctorMonocular> but for some reason I don't know, the container is being set to much larger than that
[14:32:28] <DoctorMonocular> now, if you see that container (#art_frame) in the inspector to have width:100%
[14:32:39] <DoctorMonocular> you'll see everything start to work just perfectly the way I want
[14:32:46] <DoctorMonocular> no matter how big or small the window the gets
[14:33:15] <DoctorMonocular> I guess maybe I just answered my question though, lemme try just setting the css rule...
[14:34:16] <karolyi> :D
[14:34:31] <fulminator> karolyi: http://jsfiddle.net/tTLB9/7/ the same runs in the browser moz 17. When I refresh the page, localStorage get empty. Am I missing something here? Please reply
[14:34:41] <karolyi> fulminator: please wait
[14:34:55] <fulminator> oh, okay. I thought you didnt see that.
[14:34:59] <DoctorMonocular> yay! it DOES work when I add teh rule. The FOUSC is bad, but I can fix that
[14:35:12] <DoctorMonocular> check it out now, it resizes correctly
[14:36:33] <karolyi> DoctorMonocular: is it okay for you that certain parts of the images are being hidden because of the different sizes of browser windows?
[14:37:32] <DoctorMonocular> yeah, I have to be ok with it because otherwise the ratio has to change or some part of the screen will show with an image
[14:37:48] <DoctorMonocular> the art doesn't have to displayed perfectly, just enough to get the idea (and hopefully buy… 8)
[14:38:56] <kripster> ok I am loosing the will to live, if my css files is in my image folder and I have saved my image that i want for my background then why doesn't this work at all?    .ui-page {
[14:38:56] <kripster>     background-image: url(Wallpaper.png);
[14:38:56] <kripster>     background-repeat: repeat;
[14:38:56] <kripster> }
[14:39:00] <karolyi> DoctorMonocular: maybe if you're familiar with jquery widgets, you can use this code i wrote earlier: https://github.com/karolyi/Forum/blob/master/js/widget/backgroundChanger.js
[14:39:07] <rindolf> fulminator: you need to read booksBought from the localStorage.
[14:39:21] <rindolf> fulminator: or work directly on the localStorage consistently.
[14:39:49] <rindolf> fulminator: do you understand coarse-grained persistence?
[14:40:02] <fulminator> no
[14:40:10] <fulminator> this is my 1th day with localStorage
[14:41:32] <RudyValencia> so I'm creating an element dynamically with jQuery and it's not inheriting CSS that we have applied on the classes the created object has. it's also not recognizing events that apply to it.
[14:42:29] <rindolf> fulminator: OK, then localStorage is global and persistent.
[14:42:39] <rindolf> fulminator: but you need to access it explicitly.
[14:42:45] <karolyi> fulminator: -> rindolf
[14:43:29] <karolyi> fulminator: you have to access your booksBought key directly
[14:43:37] <rindolf> fulminator: and if you do « var booksBought = [];» it is run everytime you reload the page, because a page does not remember the normal JS var variables.
[14:43:46] <kripster> how can i locate the location of my saved wallpaper so i can correctly apply it to background-image: url(Wallpaper.png);?
[14:43:52] <rindolf> fulminator: and you're overriding the one in localStorage.
[14:44:44] <karolyi> RudyValencia: did you insert your element to the dom?
[14:45:30] <karolyi> kripster: is your Wallpaper.png in the same directory as your css file which contains this setting?
[14:45:51] <robert__> karolyi: RudyValencia and I .append() it where we want it; that should work, right?
[14:46:08] <karolyi> ?demo @robert_
[14:46:09] <bot-t> robert_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:46:12] <kripster> yeah
[14:47:10] <fulminator> that's true, ty
[14:47:17] <karolyi> kripster: are you developing on http://localhost? or are you using your local file system?
[14:47:43] <kripster> karolyi: on localhost
[14:47:59] <robert_> bah.
[14:49:13] <karolyi> kripster: does your image load when you replace the css filename in the http://localhost url to your wallpaper.png?
[14:49:23] <robert_> karolyi: One moment, please... :D
[14:49:32] <rindolf> fulminator: you're welcome.
[14:49:46] <kripster> karolyi: yeah
[14:50:01] <RudyValencia> karolyi: http://75.71.137.61:3000
[14:50:10] <fulminator> ty guys, I calling a day
[14:50:20] <RudyValencia> instead http://75.71.137.61:3000/sign-in
[14:50:28] <fulminator> I still didn't finished the app, though...
[14:50:44] <karolyi> kripster: did you try it or just saying it?
[14:51:37] <kripster> karolyi: got it working, trial and error
[14:52:52] <robert_> karolyi: click the second link RudyValencia pasted. it's pretty obvious. :D
[14:52:59] <robert_> (the bug, I mean.)
[14:53:44] <karolyi> robert_: what should i see here?
[14:54:42] <robert_> the "Incorrect Email Address or Password. Please try again" div should have a style on it.
[14:54:53] <karolyi> kripster: then it should work, what browser do you have?
[14:54:56] <robert_> (karolyi)
[14:55:50] <karolyi> robert_: which styles should be applied to it, in which files?
[14:56:31] <robert_> it's in the page source, not in a .js file
[14:56:36] <kripster> yeah its working, thx karolyi
[14:56:42] <awc737> is there any reason a dynamically appended element would not register a click event?
[14:56:47] <karolyi> wtflol okay
[14:57:07] <karolyi> awc737: because it's dynamically appended.
[14:57:21] <awc737> so I'm not going crazy
[14:57:24] <karolyi> robert_: okay, and wchich one?
[14:57:24] <coldhead> awc737: did you delegate the event handler to some parent with on() or delegate() ?
[14:57:39] <awc737> I never used delegate()
[14:57:45] <karolyi> ?delegate
[14:57:46] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:58:10] <grafi> bot-t is always being so helpful
[14:58:18] <grafi> its amazeballs
[14:58:21] <awc737> that is interesting. so jQuery initially delegates all events to all elements, on a page load?
[14:58:34] <karolyi> awc737: xcuseme?
[14:58:54] <awc737> how do normal DOM elements not need to be delegated?
[14:58:58] <awc737> click events just work
[14:59:07] <karolyi> awc737: it's called event bubbling
[14:59:38] <karolyi> robert_: name the classes that are not applied
[15:03:01] <awc737> karolyi: coldhead: should I now use a delegate anon function in place of my click anon function? this element is sometimes and sometimes not dynamically appended
[15:03:17] <awc737> because it appears to work fine for both cases
[15:04:11] <coldhead> delegation is for when you have elements already in the page AND when elements are added later
[15:04:19] <coldhead> it will work with both
[15:04:26] <coldhead> so it's probably what you want
[15:04:41] <awc737> why use plain old $(element).click, in place of delegate?
[15:04:44] <karolyi> coldhead: so it's better OR then AND :)
[15:05:01] <coldhead> it's inclusive or, yes
[15:05:34] <coldhead> awc737: because if you're not adding elements dynamically click() is (conceptually) simpler
[15:06:11] <karolyi> awc737: you can append the click event to your newly created elements manually, or you can use delegate too, it's the same achievment with different methods
[15:07:06] <jobelenus> I'm having trouble searching for a specific problem I'm experiencing: basically, when moving quickly between pages button active states aren't being triggered - even though the link is triggered and the new page loads… i can't replicate this problem in the jquerymobile demo.. so I'm curious about what could be causing it (if i take my time in hitting buttons on pages, the active states work just fine)
[15:14:17] <sheilablackrose> Hi guys i got a complicated problem. I have a table with rows an a checkbox in each. I would like to get the values that are only distinct to all  http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/
[15:16:39] <robert_> karolyi: sorry, styles. it's a style tag that's supposed to be appended to the error messages; and when they're being appended, nothing's happening...
[15:18:04] <karolyi> robert_: name the classes that are not applied
[15:22:51] <fedora_newb> What does one need to do when using the validator plugin to validate a form created via ajax?
[15:23:49] <fedora_newb> I include the javascript before the form is shown. However, it never stops the form from submitting.
[15:24:45] <karolyi> fedora_newb: i don't know any form validator plugin but you have to catch the submit event, and do an event.preventDefault() to prevent the browser from submitting the form
[15:26:07] <fedora_newb> karolyi, I have it working on another form but the form I am currently working on is dynamically pulled in via ajax. Used to I would use livequery on such stuff...but not sure about this plugin.http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[15:27:46] <karolyi> fedora_newb: me neither. but when it dinamically creates the form, you have bind to the form elements submit event after inserted in the dom, or use delegate() to bind any form elements submit event later on
[15:32:24] <karolyi> sheilablackrose: state your problem more precisely please.
[15:33:56] <acidjazz> is it possible to break out of an .each in jquery
[15:34:25] <karolyi> acidjazz: not that i know of
[15:35:03] <sheilablackrose> hey karolyi. i want th evalues of only the distinct id of t hehidden field
[15:36:31] <karolyi> acidjazz: however: We can break the $.each() loop at a particular iteration by making the callback function return false. Returning non-false is the same as a continue statement in a for loop; it will skip immediately to the next iteration.
[15:37:17] <karolyi> thats also something new to me
[15:38:03] <karolyi> sheilablackrose: i don't really understand you, sorry
[15:40:16] <user_corrupt> I'm trying to add a jQuery plugin into a WordPress theme and I am getting the error "jQuery is not defined" the very last line of code in the jQuery script is throwing the error...here is the page in question: http://www.petarivcec.com/intuitivewebdesign.com/
[15:41:16] <karolyi> user_corrupt: i don't see any jquery includes in your pages source
[15:41:24] <anew> http://pastebin.com/YDwmarrP anyone can help me with this?
[15:41:32] <anew> how do i get idToDeleteLater down to the other function?
[15:42:09] <user_corrupt> karolyi: jQuery is included in WordPress, and I tried including it manually just in case, and still nothing worked
[15:42:17] <karolyi> anew: how about calling it from postobject()
[15:42:28] <anew> what do u mean?
[15:42:37] <karolyi> user_corrupt: look at the generated source, i don't see any jquery includes there
[15:43:09] <wroathe> user_corrupt: Quite literally jQuery is not defined. That's not really an error so much as it's a statement of fact.
[15:43:16] <wroathe> user_corrupt: Define jQuery, problem solved.
[15:43:59] <karolyi> anew: http://pastebin.com/Fq91w7Vy
[15:44:38] <wroathe> karolyi: Did you get your analytics thing figured out?
[15:44:48] <mfoxdogg|work> Hi all anyone here can help passing an array to an ajax get, eresulting address is http://localhost:55713/_admin/shop/product/bulk-site-view?{%22ids%22:[1020,1021]} , this is the code http://jsfiddle.net/5rhL9/
[15:44:53] <karolyi> wroathe: which one do you mean?
[15:45:09] <user_corrupt> i included link to jquery and though im not getting those errors, the plugin still isnt doing anything
[15:45:33] <anew> karolyi i cant do that
[15:45:33] <user_corrupt> i just didnt understand how jquery could not be in there since its supposed to always be included with wordpress
[15:45:36] <anew> i need them to be seperate
[15:45:48] <anew> i cant have line 6
[15:45:49] <anew>  in there
[15:46:27] <karolyi> anew: then define idToDeleteLater right after the script block
[15:47:27] <wroathe> karolyi: I thought you were having an issue with hover and trackEvent
[15:47:43] <user_corrupt> anyway, the plugin works here: http://www.petarivcec.com/intuitivewebdesign.com/wp-content/themes/theme/kwicks/kwicks.html but not when I add it to wordpress theme
[15:47:46] <user_corrupt> any ideas?
[15:47:51] <karolyi> wroathe: i'm not sure it was me
[15:48:04] <anew> got it karolyi thanks !
[15:48:09] <karolyi> user_corrupt: you're using a rather old version of jquery there,what i see
[15:48:20] <user_corrupt> ok, ill try newer
[15:49:17] <wroathe> karolyi: Might not have been
[15:49:34] <karolyi> mfoxdogg|work: why are you using GET?
[15:50:21] <mfoxdogg|work> karolyi: to get the html for the dialog and various other selections based on the data, then that form in the dialog goes to the post
[15:50:55] <karolyi> mfoxdogg|work: and what exactly is your problem?
[15:51:09] <mfoxdogg|work> look at tghe resulting Url
[15:51:25] <karolyi> mfoxdogg|work: so?
[15:51:36] <mfoxdogg|work> MVC can't understand that
[15:52:12] <karolyi> mfoxdogg|work: you're passing an escaped JSON object in the query part of the url, that's what your code does
[15:52:56] <karolyi> mfoxdogg|work: what you do with that data on the server side, is up to you.
[16:11:53] <eedfwchris> Anyone know a quick an dirty way to make this ease back out instead of snap to the bottom http://myinstachristmas.com/media/instagrid
[16:12:05] <eedfwchris> I know i can create a custom easing but I don't have a math degree.
[16:16:59] <robert_> karolyi: it isn't classes, I'm telling you- it's a style="" tag that isn't getting applied.

[16:29:00] <karolyi> robert_: should it be on the #ajaxSigninError div?
[16:29:23] <robert_> yeah, that would be the div.
[16:29:46] <karolyi> robert_: and where is the JS code which creates it?
[16:31:01] <robert_> karolyi: line(s) 72 - 77 in the html source.
[16:33:02] <karolyi> robert_: i don't see any style tag applicance there, where do you add the style?
[16:33:59] <karolyi> *style property
[16:34:12] <robert_> karolyi: juery corners applies it.
[16:39:46] <karolyi> hmm
[16:51:39] <karolyi> robert_: try to replace $("#notification-list").append(element); to $("#notification-list").append($(element));
[16:52:40] <karolyi> robert_: line 76
[17:06:42] <Fallout2man> So odd question, but I need to simulate the behavior of an <a href="#hashlink">Link To paragraph</a> style internal document link, but by via JS. Allow me to explain. My company wants to put up an html5 ad in a digital magazine and the viewport will be much smaller vertically than the entire add and they want vertical swipes to forward them like an anchor to particular portions of the ad in a specific order.
[17:07:29] <Fallout2man> But for that to work I need to be able to automatically pan the viewport to specific parts of the page, and not sure how I'd achieve that via JS.
[17:07:55] <karolyi> robert_: $("#notification-list").append($(element).clone());
[17:08:15] <karolyi> robert_: the problem lies here, i can see that clearly, only the solution is not clear to me
[17:09:40] <karolyi> Fallout2man: simple: get the position of the element, and scroll to it, meanwhile preventing the default behavior on your link
[17:10:18] <Fallout2man> karolyi: But how do I do procedurally scroll the viewport with JS code? Never done that before...
[17:10:51] <karolyi> ?postition @Fallout2man
[17:10:57] <karolyi> ?position @Fallout2man

[17:11:59] <Fallout2man> that's for retrieving it, not setting it.
[17:12:26] <karolyi> Fallout2man: with scrolltop, you can also set the vertical position
[17:12:43] <Fallout2man> karolyi: Hrmm, will try out, thanks! :D
[17:13:32] <karolyi> robert_: $("#notification-list").append($(element).clone());
[17:14:38] <Fallout2man> karolyi: Yes, this is just what I wanted. Thank you! :D
[17:16:28] <karolyi> huge vertical ads, genius ...
[17:17:03] <karolyi> RudyValencia: ?
[17:17:28] <RudyValencia> yes?
[17:17:42] <karolyi> RudyValencia: perhaps you can change the code i suggested
[17:18:16] <karolyi> before i go to sleep :D
[17:18:24] <RudyValencia> Still no effect
[17:19:37] <karolyi> RudyValencia: ok, then try this: $("#notification-list").append($('<div/>').append($(element)).html())
[17:20:36] <Oni_> hi :) how can I replace a src of "58982-c-320x194.jpg" with "58982-c-377x400.jpg" using jquery ?
[17:20:52] <RudyValencia> Ah, it's receiving styles now, but rounding is not occurring.
[17:21:39] <RudyValencia> Never mind, just had to specify the appropriate option
[17:21:40] <karolyi> RudyValencia: yes, you have to use after that part: $('#ajaxSigninError').corner('10px')
[17:21:44] <RudyValencia> got it :)
[17:22:03] <karolyi> RudyValencia: however, i think this would be worth filing a bugreport to jquery
[17:22:17] <RudyValencia> I used "#notification-list .notification" as the target for corner
[17:22:34] <RudyValencia> yeah, robert_ and I will file it
[17:22:55] <karolyi> RudyValencia: do you see what the core of the bug is?
[17:23:00] <RudyValencia> not really
[17:23:23] <RudyValencia> append() isn't updating the DOM?
[17:24:12] <karolyi> RudyValencia: after parsing your xml response, somehow jquery internally parsed the xml root tag as a second document tag or IDK, but the thing is, the element got appended to the DOM, but not into jquery internals
[17:24:35] <RudyValencia> Ah
[17:25:17] <RudyValencia> So the best way to describe this is that jQuery is updating the DOM on append() but not its own view of the document?
[17:25:18] <karolyi> RudyValencia: what's more interesting is, clone() wouldn't solve the problem, although it generates a clone of that dom node, the only help was to 'export' the content as a string, and then let jquery reparse it
[17:26:46] <karolyi> RudyValencia: yes, i think so, however it does with HTML, the problem could have been that your response was text/xml
[17:27:22] <karolyi> RudyValencia: that could cause your element not properly inserted into jquerys internals
[17:27:53] <karolyi> RudyValencia: change your Content-Type:text/xml
[17:28:04] <RudyValencia> OK
[17:28:06] <karolyi> RudyValencia: to Content-Type:text/html
[17:28:15] <RudyValencia> I'll have robert_ look into sending it as HTML
[17:28:24] <karolyi> RudyValencia: and then revert your code, test with it, let's see what happens
[17:29:18] <dlam> anyone know how to go about debugging why a .animate() complete callback isn't getting called sometimes?   seems like if i do the thing to start the animation, and then scroll off screen quickly the callback isnt called
[17:29:19] <karolyi> RudyValencia: if changing your content type to text/html fixes it, i don't know if it is still a bug, or purposely done so
[17:29:25] * dlam groans
[17:30:04] <RudyValencia> lemme see if I can get him to change it to text/html
[17:30:07] <karolyi> Oni_: that's not jquery's job, its simple JS string manipulation
[17:31:02] <karolyi> dlam: whoa, are you able to reproduce it with a clean start?
[17:31:47] <RudyValencia> karolyi: same thing happens whether it's text/html or text/xml
[17:32:04] <karolyi> RudyValencia: wait, let me test
[17:32:13] <dlam> ehhh not 100% sure what you mean,  but i'm some touchstart/touchmove/touchend to trigger a animate()
[17:32:25] <dlam> maybe touch stuff jquery animate no like -_-
[17:32:28] <RudyValencia> wait
[17:32:32] <RudyValencia> it's still xml
[17:32:35] <Oni_> karolyi: how can I replace the "77x400" part with "20x194" ?
[17:32:37] <RudyValencia> lemme change it once more
[17:34:41] <karolyi> RudyValencia: hm, actually your response should be an XML, shouldn't be parsed with jquery, i think
[17:34:46] <RudyValencia> oh
[17:35:07] <RudyValencia> well, we're trying to figure out how to return a sign-in error to this page if you get the wrong uname/password
[17:35:16] <karolyi> RudyValencia: it should be parsed with http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_parser.asp
[17:35:21] <Oni_> karolyi: should I use RegExp?
[17:35:40] <RudyValencia> I'll send Rob that link
[17:35:48] <karolyi> Oni_: you can use whatever you want to, depends on what repetitive replaces you must do
[17:36:11] <karolyi> RudyValencia: you can still file a bug, but i think the reply would be as mine
[17:36:17] <coldhead> if the expressions you're replacing are regular...
[17:36:29] <Oni_> it's always the same expression
[17:36:32] <karolyi> RudyValencia: but let me recode the js part for you
[17:36:37] <RudyValencia> it's OK
[17:36:45] <RudyValencia> we'll try xhr
[17:37:15] <karolyi> RudyValencia: why don't you just use JSON data format?
[17:37:30] <RudyValencia> we will also look into that
[17:37:49] <RudyValencia> trying to get a hold of robert_
[17:38:15] <karolyi> RudyValencia: i'd suggest to use it, and then create your element from the html source encapsulated in a JSON response
[17:38:19] <RudyValencia> OK
[17:38:46] <karolyi> RudyValencia: and also, then you wouldn't have to use the (overly complicated) xml parser
[17:39:00] <RudyValencia> robert_: you there?
[17:39:07] <RudyValencia> (he's my partner in this)
[17:39:25] <RudyValencia> I'm the frontend guy
[17:39:40] <karolyi> RudyValencia: xml replies are so yesterday :) i would not stick to it if it's not necessary
[17:39:51] <RudyValencia> yeah, let's see what he thinks perhaps
[17:39:58] <RudyValencia> I'm trying to tap him
[17:40:22] <Oni_> basically I retrieve an image src like this http://somepath/58982-c-377x400.jpg and replace the "377x400" part in it with "320x194"
[17:40:43] <karolyi> dlam: i mean, create a clean html code, and try to recreate your problem there, amybe you could end up something obvious you're missing
[17:40:48] <Oni_> the numbers never change
[17:41:10] <karolyi> dlam: and if not, it can still be understood more easily by others
[17:41:19] <dlam> ohhhh yeah good idea
[17:41:34] <coldhead> Oni_: like this http://jsfiddle.net/3GFE9/ ?
[17:42:09] <robert_> yeah; I'm here sortof
[17:42:29] <coldhead> hi robert
[17:42:33] <RudyValencia> robert_: karolyi suggested using JSON with an HTML response in place
[17:42:35] <karolyi> Oni_: when it is always the string '377x400', then you can simply user replace() on it
[17:42:36] <coldhead> always a pleasure
[17:42:43] <Oni_> coldhead: yes, I will try that
[17:42:50] <RudyValencia> instead of xml
[17:42:57] <Oni_> karolyi: ok
[17:43:07] <karolyi> -r
[17:43:08] <robert_> I already tried json
[17:43:11] <robert_> it won't work
[17:43:41] <robert_> karolyi: because json doesn't lend itself very well to doing cross-domain stuff.
[17:44:17] <karolyi> robert_: i don't see any crossdomain stuff in your code
[17:44:49] <robert_> karolyi: that form posts to :3000 so I can debug the application logic
[17:44:59] <karolyi> coldhead: you don't need a regexp there at all
[17:45:19] <karolyi> robert_: give me the url again, please
[17:45:44] <s34n> can jquery cycle's progressive option be used to load non-image slides progressively via ajax?
[17:45:58] <karolyi> s34n: explain
[17:46:16] <coldhead> karolyi: i don't NEED a lot of things, i just enjoy regular expressions
[17:47:04] <s34n> karolyi: I want to display non-image slides, but I want tp pull the content of those slides from other documents.
[17:47:30] <karolyi> robert_: well the url is on port 3000 too
[17:47:31] <s34n> karolyi: So I can define each slide in its own document
[17:47:39] <karolyi> robert_: but you can use JSONP too
[17:48:01] <WeThePeople> how do i make a popover for a image
[17:48:17] <karolyi> robert_: and by using ajax it doesn't matter if its json or xml, the crossdomain rules apply
[17:48:25] <xenome> any jquery mobile experts in the house?  I'm stuck on how to align elements withing a ui-grid
[17:48:47] <s34n> xenome: how many columns?
[17:49:00] <s34n> xenome: align horizontally?
[17:49:01] <xenome> two, one block has two control buttons, the other has a slider
[17:49:04] <xenome> yessir
[17:49:24] <xenome> so right now my buttons are way high, while the slider is lower down
[17:49:33] <s34n> xenome: jsfiddle
[17:49:45] <xenome> do I have to have an account to do that?
[17:49:52] <s34n> xenome: no
[17:50:10] <s34n> xenome: ok. so you want to align vertically?
[17:50:17] <xenome> yes
[17:50:20] <xenome> i'm sorry
[17:50:24] <karolyi> s34n: i'd suggest to use hidden iframe/iframes for that, so the browser can cache up the full content, and then simply load it, then it'll come from the cache
[17:51:38] <xenome> never used jsfiddle before, how do I include jqmobile?
[17:52:02] <s34n> xenome: add urls in manage resources
[17:53:51] <karolyi> there's no grid in the official jquery ui stable
[17:54:20] <s34n> karolyi: jquery mobile?
[17:54:38] <karolyi> ah okay
[17:54:49] <karolyi> wan't thinking on THAT one
[17:54:54] <karolyi> *wasn't
[17:55:04] <karolyi> s34n: got my reply on the other topic?
[17:55:17] <s34n> karolyi: yes
[17:55:38] <s34n> karolyi: thx
[17:56:23] <karolyi> RudyValencia: robert_ ?
[17:57:00] <RudyValencia> yeah, sorry, got pulled away
[17:57:38] <Oni_> karolyi, coldhead : thank you it worked
[17:59:00] <coldhead> hooray
[18:01:38] <xenome> s34n: http://jsfiddle.net/QSgaK/6/
[18:02:08] <xenome> s34n: I added colors to show the regions
[18:02:31] <xenome> i'd like both of those items in the grid to be aligned vertically
[18:02:32] <karolyi> RudyValencia: i'm about to go away now, but tell robert_ that cross-site-scripting rules apply to xml requests too, since it's an ajax principle, and does not depend on the content type
[18:03:10] <karolyi> RudyValencia: suggested reading is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[18:04:54] <RudyValencia> thanks
[18:05:53] <s34n> xenome: don't pm. I'm looking at your fiddle
[18:06:02] <xenome> roger that
[18:07:44] <defaultro> hey guys, i want to set a global variable to something when any value in my form changes. How can I do that?
[18:08:09] <defaultro> like globalFieldsUpdated = true;
[18:08:28] <defaultro> how can I monitor the input fields in my form?
[18:08:39] <robert_> karolyi: hm?
[18:09:08] <karolyi> robert_: scroll up
[18:09:44] <veQue> stead fast rules o discussing cost?
[18:10:06] <veQue> I'm not a negotiator,
[18:10:06] <WeThePeople> how do i make a popover for a image, ie popover the current webpage to view a larger image
[18:10:19] <robert_> yeah but :3000 is for debugging
[18:10:34] <robert_> it's supposed to crosspost to SSL
[18:10:36] <veQue> but if i were to just throw out a number to a person and say $800, how should i justify the number?
[18:10:44] <robert_> or post normally to SSL
[18:10:55] <robert_> depending on whether or not you have javascript enabled
[18:10:55] <karolyi> robert_: from an ssl host i guess
[18:11:30] <robert_> I said "crosspost", that login page is unsecured. although there's nothing saying we couldn't do that
[18:12:40] <karolyi> robert_: if you're posting to another port, it is already XSS
[18:13:02] <s34n> xenome: I show them aligned vertically -- if I make the frame wide enough
[18:13:08] <robert_> karolyi: yeah, I know.
[18:14:11] <xenome> hmm, I get the top of the buttons aligned with the top of the label
[18:14:14] <s34n> xenome: I'm not sure what the colors are supposed to illustrate
[18:14:38] <xenome> i'd like the bottom of the buttons aligned with the bottom of the slider
[18:14:42] <xenome> it was to show the regions
[18:14:44] <xenome> that's all
[18:15:10] <s34n> oh. I get it
[18:15:34] <karolyi> robert_: anyway, just that you know that it doesn't matter if you use XML or JSON replies
[18:16:21] <vali123> hey, anyone here using raphael js ?
[18:16:25] <xenome> i'm not sure why I can't just say, put whatever is in ui-block-a on the bottom of the block
[18:21:16] <s34n> xenome: I don't know. sorry
[18:21:32] <s34n> xenome: unfortunately, I've got to run
[18:33:09] <xdjuj> Hi
[18:33:20] <xdjuj> Is there a "recent" alternative to jQuery BBQ ?
[18:33:43] <xdjuj> Or is jQUery BBQ still the best way to use hashtag/history with Ajax ?
[18:34:42] <coldhead> xdjuj: i believe the "best" way now is to use a shim like https://github.com/devote/HTML5-History-API
[18:34:55] <coldhead> which uses native support when it's available
[18:35:01] <karolyi> xdjuj: that's a difficult story to be honest, but if you've come to the part where you need a URL router, i suggest trying other frameworks, i personally am experiencing with dojotoolkit now
[18:37:10] <xdjuj> I actually have just few pages in a website in an overlay
[18:37:19] <xdjuj> The content is loaded with Ajax
[18:37:55] <xdjuj> There is a link to the "real" page, but I want to replace the "real" page by the overlay
[18:38:09] <MistuhKurtz> xdjuj BBQ is nice for a quicker implementation
[18:38:31] <xdjuj> Yep but it's not "too old" ? :)
[18:38:38] <xdjuj> 2 years since last update :)
[18:41:01] <MistuhKurtz> well if it's a big complicated app I would recommend an MVC library
[18:41:40] <xdjuj> It's a simple website :)
[18:42:09] <xdjuj> I just have 3 pages in an overlay for "graphism" purpose :)
[18:42:18] <MistuhKurtz> this html5-history-api thing isn't very clear to me after a quick read
[18:42:44] <MistuhKurtz> if it was up to me I would just use BBQ because it works fine, I know the plugin author writes good code, and I'm already familiar with it
[18:43:31] <coldhead> using the official API has the virtue of it being the official API
[18:43:38] <karolyi> MistuhKurtz: the history api is clear, the only problem is, it's not supported everywhere, and also some browser implemantations differ
[18:43:53] <coldhead> whence the shim
[18:44:13] <xdjuj> Yep
[18:44:17] <MistuhKurtz> yeah I'm not going to argue against that
[18:44:36] <xdjuj> So I guess BBQ is the best way at this time, even if History API seemed to be cool
[18:44:57] <karolyi> yup
[18:45:19] <coldhead> it's cool AND the official standard way to do it
[18:45:30] <xdjuj> I already have full links on my <A>, i'm just catching them to open it in an overlay
[18:45:30] <tw2113> coldhead, just found it
[18:46:02] <xdjuj> coldhead sure, but it's not IE10 proof :)
[18:46:02] <coldhead> found what
[18:46:23] <coldhead> for which case various shims exist :)
[18:47:59] <enderx86> I'm trying to hide a div using $('#mydiv').hide(), but it won't hide... does it have to do with the fact that this div is a bootstrap container?
[18:49:07] <coldhead> see what's happening in the CSS, enderx86
[18:49:14] <coldhead> there may be a dislay: block!important somewhere
[18:49:19] <xdjuj> Have a look in Firebug enderx86
[18:49:24] <coldhead> or you may be selecting the wrong thing
[18:49:54] <xdjuj> Using .addClass("hide") could even be a great option enderx86
[18:50:19] <enderx86> Where "hide" is a pre-defined bootstrap class? Or my own custom class with visibility: hidden?
[18:50:27] <xdjuj> coldhead thanx for the tip, I will have a better look at all this http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html
[18:50:35] <xdjuj> enderx86 your own custom
[18:50:54] <xdjuj> display: none; or things like that
[18:51:40] <coldhead> yeah that's the goto reference, good luck xdjuj
[18:51:50] <xdjuj> It's great because you "know" that you've "hide" the div :) If you want for example re-open every hidden div, you can trigger the ".hide" (or whatever) divs
[18:52:14] <xdjuj> It's sometime easier enderx86
[18:52:19] <coldhead> i personally like .invisible {display: none}
[18:53:06] <xdjuj> I use "cache" because it's the french version :p
[18:53:29] <coldhead> tres bien
[18:53:30] <xdjuj> But the fact it that it's sometimes great to add a class instead of using hide (or doing both)
[18:55:05] <xdjuj> Thanx for all your answer, I need to sleep, 4 hours left before get up… :) Have a good night/day or whatever you want !
[18:55:06] <xdjuj> ++
[18:56:38] <coldhead> you little QT pie
[18:56:39] <enderx86> coldhead: $('#testdiv').css('display: none'); doesn't do the trick
[18:57:03] <coldhead> $('#testdiv').css('display', 'none');
[18:57:05] <enderx86> and testdiv isn't even a bootstrap class
[18:57:05] <coldhead> or
[18:57:20] <coldhead> $('#testdiv').css({'display': 'none'});
[18:58:49] <enderx86> coldhead:   $('#testdiv').css('display', 'none'); nor $('#testdiv').css({'display': 'none'}); do the trick
[18:59:18] <enderx86> could it be complicated by the fact that (a) it's a static file on a java application server (jetty) (b) i'm using bootstrap?
[18:59:32] <coldhead> not obviously
[18:59:42] <coldhead> what happens if you run that selector in the console
[18:59:49] <coldhead> or firebug or web inspector
[19:00:05] <enderx86> it works when I do it in the console
[19:00:07] <coldhead> doe $('#testdiv') return anything?
[19:00:09] <enderx86> hah...
[19:00:16] <coldhead> so it might be synchronisation
[19:00:24] <coldhead> is your code in $(document).ready () ?
[19:00:31] <coldhead> or is the script loading at the end of your html?
[19:00:37] <coldhead> and is it actually being loaded?
[19:00:54] <coldhead> sadly i must away to lunch. good luck sir
[19:01:01] <coldhead> or ma'am
[19:01:06] <enderx86> sir :-) yeah, i'm an idiot
[19:01:19] <enderx86> i deleted $(document).ready() elsewhere, and forgot to add it back in
[19:01:24] <coldhead> we're all of us idiots but some of us are loooking at the stars
[19:01:37] <enderx86> hah, that sounds vaguely literary
[19:01:54] <enderx86> have a good lunch, coldhead
[19:02:00] <coldhead> thanks babe
[19:04:54] <sheilablackrose> hi guys i got a complicated issue. i have a table with rows n a checkbox in each row. each row also has a number of hidden fields with id. i would like to get only the common ids of th ehidden field for the checkbox that is checked. http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/
[19:06:46] <R00tk3y> What sheil?
[19:06:54] <R00tk3y> You want t oget the one trhats are checked
[19:07:14] <WeThePeople> how do i make a popover for a image, ie popover the current webpage to view a larger image\
[19:08:17] <sheilablackrose> yup
[19:08:26] <sheilablackrose> so like if i check the first n second checkbox
[19:08:34] <sheilablackrose> the common ids form each field only will b returned
[19:08:56] <tw2113> aren't IDs supposed to be unique?
[19:09:05] <R00tk3y> Yeah this isn't even right
[19:09:14] <R00tk3y> Inputs aren't even in a form
[19:09:24] <R00tk3y> type="hidden" ?
[19:09:30] <R00tk3y> id="3"
[19:09:43] <sheilablackrose> yup im recreating what i need
[19:10:00] <R00tk3y> You could use on $('input').on('change', function()
[19:10:21] <sheilablackrose> so if th efirst n cesond checkbox is check only ids 1 n 2 will b retrived
[19:10:46] <R00tk3y> Amd ise
[19:10:49] <R00tk3y> And use*
[19:11:01] <R00tk3y> $(e.target)
[19:11:26] <defaultro> how can I use jquery to monitor changes in an input text field?
[19:11:36] <R00tk3y> if($(e.target).attr('id') == 1))
[19:11:57] <R00tk3y> Defaultro, the whole form of input fields, or one specifically?
[19:12:06] <defaultro> any field in a form
[19:12:28] <R00tk3y> $('form').on('change', function()
[19:12:29] <defaultro> when a field gets modified, I'd like to assign true to a global variable
[19:12:46] <defaultro> what does that do R00tk3y ?
[19:12:57] <R00tk3y> If something on your form changes
[19:12:58] <defaultro> that monitors anything on the form?
[19:13:02] <R00tk3y> It calls a function
[19:13:03] <defaultro> wow, that is awesome! :)
[19:13:07] <defaultro> that's what I need
[19:13:14] <R00tk3y> And you can use
[19:13:22] <R00tk3y> a java object to store your settings
[19:13:35] <R00tk3y> var FormChangedField = {}
[19:13:37] <defaultro> $('form').on('change', function(setGlobal));
[19:13:44] <R00tk3y> Well
[19:13:50] <R00tk3y> Yeah I think it does pass the this
[19:13:53] <defaultro> setGlobal is a function
[19:13:56] <R00tk3y> Then use
[19:14:14] <R00tk3y> var fieldChanged = $(this).attr(id);
[19:14:20] <R00tk3y> And then
[19:14:43] <R00tk3y> Hmm
[19:14:50] <defaultro> will my code above work?
[19:14:51] <R00tk3y> I wonder how you would dynamically push it
[19:15:48] <R00tk3y> Well setGlobal would be the this, I believe
[19:15:54] <defaultro> k
[19:17:09] <defaultro> $('form').on('change', setGlobal) <- is this proper?
[19:17:20] <defaultro> function setGlobal() {.....}
[19:17:43] <R00tk3y> Yeah
[19:17:47] <defaultro> k
[19:17:50] <defaultro> :) thank
[19:17:53] <defaultro> Thanks
[19:17:55] <defaultro> I'll try it
[19:18:09] <R00tk3y> Make sure its defined before it though
[19:18:40] <sheilablackrose> R00tkey help me plz
[19:18:47] <R00tk3y> Whats up Sheila?
[19:19:03] <defaultro> yup
[19:25:53] <defaultro> R00tk3y, i have an error in the syntax
[19:26:10] <defaultro> $('form').on('change'), setGlobal);
[19:26:18] <defaultro> I am missing an open parentheses
[19:26:45] <martisj> is addy osmani ever in here
[19:26:47] <martisj> ?
[19:26:55] <defaultro> $('form').on('change', setGlobal);
[19:26:57] <defaultro> :)
[19:28:15] <defaultro> R00tk3y, it didn't see any change in the form
[19:28:42] <defaultro> i used the id
[19:28:51] <defaultro> i'll use $('form') for now
[19:30:17] <defaultro> yup, it doesn't know where to find $('form')
[19:30:32] <R00tk3y> Hello
[19:30:44] <defaultro> hi
[19:30:45] <R00tk3y> Defaultro, show me the code
[19:30:48] <defaultro> it din't work
[19:30:49] <defaultro> ok
[19:31:08] <defaultro> $('form').on('change', setGlobal);
[19:31:23] <defaultro> then setGlobal is a very simple function
[19:31:30] <defaultro> it doesn't jump there
[19:31:34] <defaultro> I'm using firebug
[19:32:07] <R00tk3y> Oh you know what
[19:32:11] <defaultro> k
[19:32:31] <R00tk3y> I thought you could use .on('change'), I thought it would be the main function that .change calls
[19:32:45] <R00tk3y> But I guess I assumed, and you know what they say about assuming lol.
[19:32:53] <defaultro> :P lol
[19:33:05] <R00tk3y> .change(yourFucntion)
[19:33:16] <defaultro> what would be the whole line?
[19:33:28] <defaultro> $('form').change(setGlobal);
[19:33:29] <R00tk3y> $('form').change(function()
[19:33:30] <R00tk3y> {
[19:33:32] <R00tk3y> }
[19:33:34] <R00tk3y> );
[19:33:36] <defaultro> oh
[19:33:40] <defaultro> doing it now
[19:33:43] <R00tk3y> Thats for anonymous function
[19:33:51] <R00tk3y> You could just pass the name of the function in
[19:34:02] <defaultro> or call inside
[19:36:27] <defaultro> doesn't work
[19:36:31] <essial> I know this isn't jquery-specific but still -- With HTML 5 canvas, when I set the size to greater than the render size, it obviously upscales the image, and in the process blurs the crap out of it. Is there a way to disable filtering and simply let me pick the nearest neighbor style of rendering instead?
[19:36:41] <R00tk3y> Defaultro
[19:36:43] <R00tk3y> Show me all your code
[19:36:45] <defaultro> maybe, I should put it on main and not call it after condition
[19:36:45] <R00tk3y> jsfiddle.com
[19:36:56] <defaultro> looks like that code is a listener
[19:37:39] <essial> i'm attempting to do a retro-esque 320x240 scaled up to the display. the scailing and internal 320x240 size work great, centers great.. but the bluring is horrid
[19:38:06] <R00tk3y> Yes it is
[19:43:35] <essial> answered my own question, they added imageSmoothingEnabled to the canvas spec
[19:47:04] <R00tk3y> Defaultro
[19:47:07] <R00tk3y> Did you figure it out?
[19:47:26] <defaultro> no, I'm trying to figure out how I should write it in jsfiddle
[19:47:49] <defaultro> here, let me tell you want I want to do
[19:48:03] <defaultro> imagine there is a form that is shown on the screen'
[19:48:28] <defaultro> there is an input field called firstname and has a current value of R00tkey
[19:48:51] <defaultro> beneath the form, imagine there are other links to other names like defaultr0 for example
[19:49:09] <defaultro> when I click on defaultro link, I want to check if the form was altered
[19:49:33] <defaultro> is it clear?
[19:50:38] <defaultro> maybe, I can put the old values to a global variable once the form gets opened. Now, when I click outside, I can use .val() and compare it to the global variable
[19:51:29] <defaultro> if (global.firstname == $('.firstname').val()) { console.log("values are the same"); }
[19:51:48] <defaultro> do you like that approach R00tk3y ?
[20:11:45] <sheilablackrose> hi anyone here?
[20:12:13] <coldhead> sure why not
[20:12:28] <sheilablackrose> im trying to get the values of the hidden field that is checked but only th eismilar values http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/8/
[20:12:37] <sheilablackrose> please help
[20:24:50] <tw2113> here's a question sheilablackrose, why so many hidden fields? what is their purpose?
[20:26:08] <snover> they’re bashful
[20:26:11] <snover> leave them alone
[20:26:13] <snover> bully
[20:26:49] <sheilablackrose> its
[20:26:54] <sheilablackrose> a bvalue retrived from a db
[20:27:00] <sheilablackrose> a value
[20:27:02] <sheilablackrose> a values
[20:27:17] <sheilablackrose> so i need to get those values when the checkbox is click
[20:28:04] <tw2113> so you're trying to store data that will be used to query a db via ajax at a later step?
[20:28:13] <tw2113> store and retrieve, i should say
[20:28:19] <coldhead> you can't have duplicate IDs, sheilablackrose
[20:28:24] <coldhead> they have to be unique
[20:28:40] <sheilablackrose> yes
[20:28:58] <sheilablackrose> that actually determines another models checkboxes
[20:29:34] <sheilablackrose> so if there is only one common id say flagid 1  than the next model that will popup will only have one checkbox with the value 1 n that value will b saved
[20:30:47] <sheilablackrose> any idea how i can get the values?
[20:31:02] <tw2113> i'm not even sure if hidden fields are the best way to go about this
[20:31:21] <sheilablackrose> well im fine with anything as long as it doesnt display n i cn retrive the values
[20:31:29] <coldhead> at least you have some idea what is trying to be achieved, tw2113
[20:31:32] <coldhead> i envy you
[20:31:43] <tw2113> "something" is my only answer
[20:31:49] <sheilablackrose> if u guys find thi sconfusing imagine me
[20:32:24] <tw2113> well you generally know what you need to do
[20:32:30] <tw2113> you just don't know how to approach it
[20:32:32] <forsto> is JQuery a typo in this page? http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[20:32:35] <tw2113> coldhead and i are guessing
[20:32:37] <sheilablackrose> ok just say i figure out how to get all the values of the fields that i need. how do i compare them to get only the similar field
[20:32:46] <sheilablackrose> whats the logic for that
[20:32:47] <sheilablackrose> ?
[20:32:51] <coldhead> sheilablackrose: if you can maybe write up a comment on jsfiddle about what you're trying to achieve and the data you're working with and how you want it to look, tw2113 will help you make it happen
[20:33:02] <tw2113> coldhead lies!
[20:33:05] <tw2113> it's his 2nd day
[20:33:07] <sheilablackrose> hahaha
[20:33:33] <tw2113> not sure what part you're talking about forsto
[20:33:41] <coldhead> i'm not sure that matters, forsto
[20:33:55] <coldhead> he means the capital J in JQuery in the title
[20:34:00] <tw2113> did someone type jqueery?
[20:34:07] <tw2113> ah
[20:34:14] <forsto> It just looks strange
[20:34:24] <sheilablackrose> my god i cnt even get this test to work     $('.documentCheckBox').click(function () {
[20:34:24] <sheilablackrose>     alert("hi");
[20:34:25] <sheilablackrose>     });
[20:34:30] <sheilablackrose> :(
[20:35:11] <tw2113> i have it working fine
[20:35:21] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/10/
[20:39:08] <sheilablackrose> y it didnt work in mine
[20:39:27] <sheilablackrose> anyway tw2113 can you help me with this? to get the distinct value?
[20:39:27] <tw2113> my theory is you had mootools loaded on the left instead of jQuery
[20:39:38] <sheilablackrose> whats mootools?
[20:39:47] <tw2113> a different javascript library
[20:39:56] <sheilablackrose> ic
[20:42:01] <tw2113> am i obligated to show how i do it if i manage to succeed?
[20:42:18] <sheilablackrose> pleaseeeeeeeeeee
[20:42:37] <tw2113> am i obligated to say i'll even succeed at all?
[20:42:53] <coldhead> less talk more action
[20:43:14] <sheilablackrose> it should be easy for you seen u helping with stuff i cnt even understand :)
[20:43:27] <tw2113> doesn't mean i know what i'm doing
[20:43:31] <tw2113> i could be talking latin
[20:43:54] <coldhead> the stuff you can't understand is usually building from a more coherent basis
[20:44:06] <sheilablackrose> lol
[20:44:09] <coldhead> rather than a whole bunch of hidden inputs with duplicate IDs
[20:44:14] <halluz> Hey all, looking for some help with some hover action: http://jsfiddle.net/dLc3u/14/ Basically, I have a link that has an image in the middle of it, and when the link is hovered, the image needs to switch to a different color of the image to match the link hover behavior
[20:44:15] <coldhead> purpose: unclear
[20:45:34] <munderwo-work> Hi all. IM having trouble running down some memory leaks. in the following snippet http://jsfiddle.net/wJQEE/ is the variable largeVariable ever going to freed by the garbage collector?
[20:45:48] <munderwo-work> and if not, how do people get around this limitation?
[20:46:00] <coldhead> halluz: http://jsfiddle.net/dLc3u/15/
[20:46:03] <coldhead> no JS needed
[20:46:54] <sheilablackrose> well basically its a field from a database that has an xml of string values. so for each row there is a doc. n in each doc there is a array called flagids. those are the hiddenfields value
[20:47:17] <sheilablackrose> here what i did so far still have no clue http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/11/
[20:47:54] <coldhead> munderwo-work: http://jsfiddle.net/wJQEE/1/
[20:47:56] <coldhead> use a closure
[20:48:25] <halluz> coldhead: That's actually what I started with, but for some reason it will only show me the updated image when the image is hovered
[20:48:57] <coldhead> halluz: are you messing with an <img> src or a background-image CSS property?
[20:48:59] <halluz> nvm, im stupid
[20:49:04] <tw2113> sheilablackrose, from the looks of it, you're selecting ALL of the hidden items regardless of what checkbox you clicked
[20:49:15] <coldhead> best wishes for the rest of your life, halluz
[20:49:19] <halluz> haha
[20:49:23] <halluz> thanks
[20:50:35] <munderwo-work> coldhead: right. The issue I have is that im using backbone. so its more complicated than my simple example. have you used backbone before?
[20:50:37] <tw2113> i'm trying to figure out what makes each hidden value special or relevant
[20:50:45] <coldhead> yes i have, munderwo-work
[20:51:36] <coldhead> tw2113: is it love?
[20:51:43] <coldhead> is it love that makes them relevant?
[20:51:45] <tw2113> and why each checkbox has a different amount of hidden values associated with its row
[20:52:21] <coldhead> munderwo-work: have you asked in ##documentcloud ?
[20:52:36] <coldhead> if you can get a hold of tbranyen he is a good guy to ask about backbone stuff
[20:52:39] <sheilablackrose> yup thats why i need to get the similar ones
[20:52:48] <coldhead> he's online if you wanna PM him
[20:52:48] <tw2113> you need organization first
[20:53:05] <sheilablackrose> like if checkbox 1 has hidden value 1 n 2 while checkbox 2 has hidden value 1
[20:53:07] <munderwo-work> coldhead: yeah, there doesnt seem to be anyone answering over there.. im just doing up a quick code snippet of what im doing..
[20:53:07] <sheilablackrose> i only retrive 1
[20:53:13] <munderwo-work> i'll try tbrayen
[20:53:19] <tw2113> no you retrieve them all
[20:55:25] <tw2113> jsfiddle sucks! long live jsbin!
[20:55:43] <sheilablackrose> its like this. i have a table called documents. it has a dynamic created row based on th enumber of docs in the db. each row has a checkbox. in each doc there is an array of string flagids. diff doc can have diff amount of ids. what i need is that when a check box is click it gets the flagids from it. but if more than one checkbox is click it will get only the similar ids
[20:56:50] <tw2113> how do you mean similar IDs?
[20:57:25] <coldhead> munderwo-work: this is the most work i've done with backbone https://github.com/coldhead/conversational-latin -- it does nothing special regarding GC but if you find a nice fix and feel like applying it you are very welcome
[20:58:11] <munderwo-work> coldhead: i've asked tbranyen over on ##documentcloud so i'll see how it goes. my snippet is http://jsfiddle.net/YqKmj/ if you have 5 mins to see if im doing anything stupid
[20:58:35] <coldhead> i've paged tbranyen for you, he's far more expert than i :P
[20:59:09] <sheilablackrose> wel like doc1 id = 1  flagids = {1,2,3,4,5} name = test, doc2 id=2 flagids = {1,2,4,6,7} name = test2, doc3 id = 3 flagids = {1} name = test3
[20:59:12] <sheilablackrose> something like that
[20:59:20] <munderwo-work> coldhead: thanks heaps.. this is really frustrating me... as I just dont understand how to get around it.
[21:00:45] <tw2113> and each checkbox is supposed to represent one doc ?
[21:01:10] <coldhead> munderwo-work: have you checked with the chrome profiling tools that memory is actually being leaked?
[21:01:32] <sheilablackrose> yup
[21:01:53] <sheilablackrose> im using the doc id as the checkbox id
[21:02:43] <munderwo-work> coldhead: yeah thats why i'm going down this path :) I've got a cleanup function that *should* be getting rid of everything. when it does the jsheap size is about 10MB. when the colleciton isnt cleaned up for whatever eason the heapsize is like 50MB (its a pretty large collection that we use all over the place. hence why memory usage is really important)
[21:03:02] <tw2113> and the hidden fields are meant to be the flagIDs?
[21:03:29] <sheilablackrose> yeah
[21:03:40] <sheilablackrose> should i have not used hidden fields?
[21:03:44] <tw2113> coldhead, dare me to introduce data attributes?
[21:03:56] <sheilablackrose> i dont want the values to be displayed
[21:04:02] <tw2113> they won't be
[21:04:33] <sheilablackrose> ic
[21:05:06] <coldhead> tw2113: double dare you
[21:05:20] <coldhead> i will make out with my armpit on cam if you can get it across the line
[21:05:33] <tw2113> trying to remember if data-attributes can do anything but string, and have something like commas
[21:05:42] <coldhead> (Armpit makeout offer not good outside Portugal)
[21:06:05] <sheilablackrose> .....
[21:06:14] <sheilablackrose> is there another meaning for armpit?
[21:06:23] <coldhead> i hope not
[21:06:41] <coldhead> although that does remind me of a terrible maria bamford joke
[21:06:46] <coldhead> better not to go there
[21:07:04] <tw2113> i know who she is
[21:07:59] <coldhead> let's be friends forever tw2113
[21:08:01] <sheilablackrose> do u guys know each other?
[21:08:06] <enderx86> In the bootstrap grid system, is it okay if I have multiple divs inside a row that aren't a spanx class, and multiple divs inside a spanx div?
[21:08:07] <sheilablackrose> ...
[21:08:15] <coldhead> it's my first day knowing tw2113, sheilablackrose
[21:08:16] <tw2113> he's...coldhead
[21:08:17] <coldhead> but so far so good
[21:08:30] <tw2113> i think he wants me
[21:08:42] <coldhead> enderx86: that question made me throw up in my mouth a little
[21:08:52] <coldhead> isn't there a ##bootstrap channel or something?
[21:09:30] <enderx86> coldhead: there are only 10 people there
[21:09:45] <enderx86> is it a #javascript question?
[21:09:46] <coldhead> aw :(
[21:09:51] <coldhead> oh god no
[21:09:59] <coldhead> nothing is ever a #javascript question
[21:10:03] <coldhead> you'll be torn to pieces
[21:10:11] <sheilablackrose> tw2113 you are a female?
[21:10:30] <tw2113> only in an alternate universe
[21:10:32] <coldhead> let's avoid discussing gender, sir
[21:10:53] <coldhead> no good can come of it
[21:11:05] <coldhead> just heartbreak and veneral disease
[21:11:16] <sheilablackrose> lol
[21:14:40] <coldhead> even further away than when you were here
[21:15:38] <sheilablackrose> this what i got so far n it stoped working http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/13/
[21:16:07] <sheilablackrose> oh nevermnd that wont work
[21:16:14] <sheilablackrose> it cnt distinguish which row
[21:16:32] <sheilablackrose> i think i need a table id?
[21:17:41] <coldhead> you should have as many IDs as possible
[21:18:25] <tw2113_too> fake ids are fake
[21:18:30] <tw2113_too> and they never fool bouncers
[21:19:00] <edude03> How would I submit a form without calling the forms submit handler?
[21:20:21] <edude03> I'm catching the submit event so calling form.submit() causes a loop :/
[21:23:17] <sheilablackrose> tw2113 HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[21:24:55] <tw2113_too> i feel no obligation or guaranteed success
[21:25:21] <sheilablackrose> well better than what i have so far
[21:25:33] <tw2113_too> unless, you know, i make things worse
[21:25:51] <coldhead> but could you, tw2113_too, could you really
[21:26:29] <scar> tw2113, have you ever used webrtc?
[21:26:34] <tw2113> nope
[21:26:38] <tw2113> i've heard of the term though
[21:26:43] <scar> just curious if you liked it.
[21:26:57] <tw2113> couldn't tell ya
[21:26:58] <scar> real time audio/video, etc into web apps
[21:28:10] <coldhead> this is a good/scary webrtc app http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/webcam-displacement/
[21:28:37] <tw2113> why does attr() never seem to work on IDs?
[21:28:43] <coldhead> rmill is going to add webrtc to http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/
[21:28:50] <coldhead> aren't you rmill
[21:28:59] <coldhead> WHOSEAGOODBOYYESYOUAREYESYOUARE
[21:29:03] <coldhead> etc
[21:34:06] <sheilablackrose> tw2113 any idea ?
[21:34:19] <tw2113> on what? life?
[21:34:51] <sheilablackrose> the code
[21:34:58] <tw2113> the konami code?
[21:35:01] <tw2113> i think it's awesome
[21:35:09] <tw2113> up up down down left right left right ba select start
[21:35:12] <tw2113> *thumbs up*
[21:35:17] <sheilablackrose> :)
[21:39:20] <coldhead> ?fweep
[21:39:20] <bot-t> coldhead, KLOMP
[21:45:29] <tw2113> best i have http://jsbin.com/aqanar/1/edit
[21:45:42] <wroathe> DoctorMonocular: Did you get your problem figured out yesterday?
[21:46:07] <sheilablackrose> thanks tw2113
[21:46:13] <sheilablackrose> ill study the code
[21:46:14] <tw2113> i guarantee nothing
[21:46:22] <tw2113> and any breakage is coldhead's fault
[21:46:36] <tw2113> not much there
[21:47:16] <tw2113> and i'm sure if i knew all the details of the project at hand and was responsible for solving it, i'd come up with something more awesome
[21:51:18] <sheilablackrose> tw2113 i dont quite getthe code bt its basically giving out all the array right
[21:52:11] <tw2113> it's likely highly inefficient
[21:52:33] <tw2113> but it should be pushing the data-flagid attributes into an array
[21:52:44] <tw2113> not sure how to unset them if someone unchecks a box
[21:52:49] <khurram> hi guys
[21:52:56] <khurram> i want to compare 4 different variables and return true if they all hold the same value can some one suggest a quick robust comparision in javascript. please
[21:52:59] <sheilablackrose> can u look a this
[21:53:09] <tw2113> do i have to
[21:53:35] <sheilablackrose> please
[21:53:44] <sheilablackrose> how do i say get the values of the next td
[21:53:45] <sheilablackrose> ?
[21:53:58] <khurram> if( a == b == c == d) is that the right way in javascript ?
[21:54:18] <tw2113> whatever i put up isn't dependent on adjacent table cells
[21:54:29] <tw2113> each checkbox relates to itself
[21:55:27] <sheilablackrose> yup so your code get all the string right is there away to compare it with each other
[21:55:27] <sheilablackrose> ?
[21:55:32] <sheilablackrose> than get only the distinct one
[21:55:43] <sheilablackrose> can i show u a code i did in c#?
[21:55:52] <tw2113> i wouldn't understand c#
[21:55:54] <sheilablackrose> may b u cn figure something fom that
[21:56:04] <tw2113> i'm no c# developer
[21:58:14] <sheilablackrose> how can i say get the next td ?
[21:58:23] <coldhead> sheilablackrose: you might have better luck in here during the US daytime when there are lots of C# developers to help you, like ajpiano
[21:58:44] <sheilablackrose> yeah but im short on time
[21:58:48] <sheilablackrose> var hiddenFields = $(this).next('td').find("input[type='hidden']");
[21:58:55] <sheilablackrose> is that the way to say get the next field?
[21:59:00] <sheilablackrose> next td fields?
[21:59:28] <coldhead> that looks like it might work, sheilablackrose
[21:59:36] <sheilablackrose> but it doesnt :p
[22:00:12] <coldhead> $(this).closest('td').nextAll('td:first').find(':hidden')
[22:01:50] <sheilablackrose> coldhead http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/15/
[22:01:53] <sheilablackrose> it says 0
[22:03:29] <sheilablackrose> $(this ) is now refering to the current checkbox right. so $(this).find('td') will mean the checkbox td right? so $(this).find('td').next('td') will b the td im looking for?
[22:04:19] <sheilablackrose> damnnn
[22:04:20] <sheilablackrose> doenst work
[22:04:52] <coldhead> find searches children
[22:05:06] <coldhead> you probably don't have a td inside your checkbox
[22:05:21] <coldhead> to search forr ancestors you want to use ?closest
[22:05:21] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[22:05:42] <coldhead> $(this).closest('td').nextAll('td:first')
[22:06:01] <coldhead> will find you the first next sibling td if this is a child of a td
[22:07:53] <sheilablackrose> ic
[22:08:32] <sheilablackrose> why not just closet td
[22:08:36] <sheilablackrose> why do you need next all
[22:08:39] <sheilablackrose> n td:frst
[22:08:48] <coldhead> don't you want the next td?
[22:08:56] <coldhead> if you don't want the next td don't use next or nextall
[22:08:59] <coldhead> just use closest
[22:09:36] <coldhead> it's all an effort
[22:09:49] <sheilablackrose> yeah i wnat th enext td
[22:10:06] <sheilablackrose> so basically closest td will get you the td the checkbox is in? than next all gets you the next one
[22:10:06] <sheilablackrose> ?
[22:10:16] <coldhead> yes
[22:10:18] <coldhead> ?tias
[22:10:19] <bot-t> Try It And See
[22:10:57] <sheilablackrose>   var hiddenFields = $(this).closest('td').nextAll('td:first').attr('id'); should get me the id of the td right
[22:11:07] <sheilablackrose> but it gets undefined
[22:11:43] <coldhead> try console.log( $(this).closest('td').nextAll('td:first') )
[22:11:52] <coldhead> and see if it's actually matching anything
[22:13:53] <sheilablackrose> it says td
[22:14:01] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/16/
[22:16:16] <sheilablackrose> oh ait its working without th efirst
[22:19:05] <coldhead> i am surprised anything works
[22:19:11] <coldhead> your table isn't valid html
[22:19:18] <coldhead> you don't close your <td>s
[22:19:24] <coldhead> it's all very scary and upsetting
[22:19:31] <coldhead> i think i have to go home to be alone for a while now
[22:22:29] <R00tk3y> Okay why would javascript run the next lines of code while an ajax request is waiting?
[22:22:33] <R00tk3y> Is there a way to prevent this?
[22:26:06] <R00tk3y> Anyone here?
[22:27:29] <kborchers> ?ajax101 @ R00tk3y
[22:27:30] <bot-t> R00tk3y, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[22:27:48] <sheilablackrose> eh i thouh i did
[22:29:20] <R00tk3y> Right kborchers
[22:29:22] <R00tk3y> Its going to be tricky
[22:29:36] <R00tk3y> Because the form also Validates password before it
[22:29:41] <R00tk3y> then it validates the email to the server
[22:30:13] <trinadh> R00tk3y: just place the code in success function which you want to run only after the request is completed, or make the ajax call synchronous
[22:30:27] <R00tk3y> I cant
[22:30:36] <R00tk3y> Because they have the ability to update there password or email
[22:30:40] <R00tk3y> They dont have to update both
[22:31:07] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/20/ now there is anothe rproblem
[22:31:11] <R00tk3y> It has to ask the server if the email is valid, and if it is then its allowed to send the whole form over
[22:31:31] <R00tk3y> I think I got a way to do it
[22:31:32] <R00tk3y> brb
[22:31:54] <coldhead> good luck weirdos
[22:32:37] <sheilablackrose> how cn i make an array in an array
[22:32:38] <sheilablackrose> ?
[22:35:35] <trinadh> sheilablackrose: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] ?
[22:36:14] <sheilablackrose> somethoing like myarray = [{ids:[]}]
[22:36:39] <sheilablackrose> so i would have name1 ids 1,2,3   name2 ids 3,4,5
[22:38:21] <trinadh> sheilablackrose:  You mean associative array.. its same as creating an object in javascript..
[22:38:56] <sheilablackrose> ic how do i do that
[22:39:03] <sheilablackrose> or actually would u look at my codes?
[22:39:18] <sheilablackrose> i might not even need one but im not good with the syntax
[22:39:29] <sheilablackrose> i know there is a way in c# but not in jquery
[22:39:35] <trinadh> sheilablackrose: looking ..
[22:39:49] <trinadh> sheilablackrose: oh.. how would you do in c#
[22:39:59] <sheilablackrose> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5815046/how-to-form-an-array-of-arrays-in-jquery
[22:40:02] <sheilablackrose> im stuck here
[22:40:09] <sheilablackrose> right now i have all the rows n all the values
[22:40:19] <sheilablackrose> i need some way to compare them n to retrive the distinct
[22:40:57] <sheilablackrose> sorry wrong one
[22:40:58] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/20/
[22:41:07] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/zqCNN/21/
[22:41:10] <sheilablackrose> this the latest
[22:41:24] <sheilablackrose> i have no idea what to do about the logic
[22:42:54] <trinadh> your code gives you an array of container, with an object, so to get first of flagids, i will have to call container[0].flagids[0]
[22:43:20] <sheilablackrose> but it only stores one when i try to click on the second box it throws n error
[23:38:40] <lxsameer> how can i select all the element inside of an element with "SOMEID" id
[23:39:15] <halluz> $("#SOMEID").contents()
[23:44:14] <coldhead> halluz++
