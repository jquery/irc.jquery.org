[00:12:46] <min|dvir|us> Hi. Is there any way to trigger an event with a custom event object?
[00:16:21] <TheRiot> Why is this.textBox.position.width changing between the start and end of this code?  http://jsfiddle.net/hdVNG/
[00:17:18] <TheRiot> it doesn't appear to be deep copying
[00:22:21] <TheRiot> textBox.position is an instance of a class.  could jquery possibly not be copying that?
[00:32:14] <raj> is something wrong with this? $(document).css({"background-color": "red"})
[00:33:20] <rtyler> can I view HTTP headers returned from a specific $.ajax() call or is that not really visible from the javascript layer?
[00:33:21] <TheRiot> The syntax is $(document).css("background-color", "red");
[00:33:50] <raj> that too doesn't work
[00:35:35] <rtyler> nevermind, I think I found a workaround
[00:35:39] * rtyler heads back to work
[00:37:26] <smares> if I want to dynamically create an image and be notified when it loaded, can I use $('<img/>', { src: '...', load: function() { ... } })?
[00:37:56] <smares> or do I have to create it without the src property and add it afterwards?
[00:41:32] <TheRiot> oh, are you trying to set the background of the entire page?
[00:41:54] <TheRiot> if so, I think you'd want to do $("body").css("background-color", "red")
[00:50:37] <tw2113> $("body").css("background-color", "#c0ffee");
[00:50:39] <tw2113> ;)
[00:51:20] <min|dvir|us> There's nothing wrong with .css({ backgroundColor: 'red' }).
[00:51:29] <tw2113> but i wanted to spell out coffee
[00:51:43] <min|dvir|us> (Yes, that works.)
[00:52:08] <tw2113> if only it wasn't a light blue
[00:54:30] <TheRiot> haha
[01:07:39] <min|dvir|us> tw2113: actually closer to green.
[01:08:37] <tw2113> nonetheless not a great color imho
[01:16:03] <TylerWhitney> its similar to the sky
[01:16:32] <TylerWhitney> er.. the tint color of the ocean in cozumel, mexico
[01:22:49] <min|dvir|us> Who wants to see this thing I just made?
[01:25:40] <JohnyBlack> i do
[01:28:05] <min|dvir|us> JohnyBlack: http://jsfiddle.net/N8XFS/1/
[01:32:14] <TylerWhitney> i dont get it
[01:32:27] <min|dvir|us> TylerWhitney: shows you if you typed your password in right without a form submission.
[01:33:04] <TylerWhitney> AHA
[01:33:10] <TylerWhitney> weird
[01:33:22] <TylerWhitney> time saver
[01:34:18] <TylerWhitney> I really like this
[01:35:21] <TylerWhitney> really creative and cool use case
[01:41:04] <min|dvir|us> TylerWhitney: thank you.
[01:41:59] <JohnyBlack> min|dvir|us: nice one ;D
[01:49:02] <_zoggy_> i know there is a jshint and jslint.. but is there a jquery*lint/hint /
[01:49:21] <_zoggy_> and can anyone recommend a jshint var set to use with jquery code
[01:49:42] <_zoggy_> tweaking a build script and noticed that were using the defaults currently
[01:55:14] <TylerWhitney> there is a jquery checkbox can be used on jshint.com
[02:46:39] <krn0> hi
[02:47:03] <krn0> anybody around?
[02:52:35] <Aster> Uh.
[03:00:33] <kaolti> hey everyone
[03:01:29] <kaolti> im using jquery to load page content with the load function and I'm getting Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #/en/hardware-types/routers/
[03:01:40] <kaolti> cause im adding # for the url hashtag
[03:01:56] <kaolti> anyone knows how to solve this?
[03:02:05] <kaolti> the load does work tho, but im getting this error
[03:14:41] <Kottizen_> Good day everyone! I'm making a little PM function for the users on my website. Users can send PMs to everyone, not only those they have as friends. However, to make it easier to contact friends, I've added a friend list to the left.
[03:14:45] <Kottizen_> When clicking a friend's name, that name will replace whatever's already in the "Till:" input box. My question is, is it possible to make the friend's name fly and land in that box? It's not mandatory, everything works, but it'd be cool to have. Here's what it looks like: http://simplest-image-hosting.net/png-0-vcn765
[03:15:36] <Kottizen_> Currently I just have this simple jQuery to replace the user name: $('#username')val(clicked_user);
[03:29:35] <krillep> I'm adding script nodes to the DOM dynamically to include js-files. But when i remove the node, the script file is still visible in chrome's dev. tools "script-tab". As a result, the same script file appears several times in the script tab after a while... Does any one have a solution to this?   (I'm not using jQuery for this but pure JavaScript)
[03:43:39] <michael_mbp> hi all
[03:43:51] <michael_mbp> I've got an array which I'm watching as '1: "No, CPD only"'
[03:44:12] <michael_mbp> However, `if (str[1] == "No CPD only"){` isn't triggering?
[03:53:27] <Phiphel> michael_mbp, forgot a komma in there?
[03:53:51] <michael_mbp> a comma where?
[03:54:13] <Phiphel> == "No[HERE] cpd ... "
[03:54:35] <michael_mbp> OMFGGGGGG
[03:54:37] <michael_mbp> thanks!
[03:54:40] <Phiphel> :D
[03:54:41] <Phiphel> np
[03:56:01] <michael_mbp> thanks sooo much
[03:56:08] <michael_mbp> you don't know how long I was debugging this!
[03:56:31] <Phiphel> heh, you can stare yourself blind on those things. We've all been there. :)
[04:00:21] <michael_mbp> hey Phiphel what's the trick with fadeIn() to give that yellow flash?
[04:01:27] <Phiphel> I'm not sure. But it sounds like animate() more than fadeIn()
[04:01:41] <Phiphel> But I don't know what yellow flash you're talking about.
[04:01:59] <michael_mbp> ah it's just an animation effect I've seen in many examples
[04:02:15] <michael_mbp> yellow 'flash' and the content fades in… I'll check animate() thanks
[04:02:52] <michael_mbp> ahh effect("highlight", {}, 1500);
[04:03:38] <Phiphel> That's part of JQUI iirc.
[04:04:09] <michael_mbp> hmm yeah
[04:10:52] <Bartzy> Hi
[04:11:05] <Bartzy> $('body') is exactly the same as $(document.body) ?
[04:11:09] <Bartzy> Which should be used ?
[04:20:50] <michael_mbp> thanks Phiphel
[04:21:07] <Phiphel> np
[04:21:16] <Phiphel> Bartzy: the first one.
[04:21:41] <Bartzy> Phiphel: They're the same logically ? Why the first ?
[04:22:12] <Phiphel> Because it's the selector syntax for jq.
[04:22:47] <Phiphel> The other one is mixing (and making it harder to read and edit) your code.
[04:54:52] <krn0> any ecommerce site with jquery/jparallax on it?
[05:02:46] <vampire_weekend> help moi
[05:03:04] <vampire_weekend> The inserted record has been constantly repeating
[05:05:17] <vampire_weekend> please help me I'm not that good with jQuery
[05:10:10] <vampire_weekend> problem I had is when I'm clicking a checkbox
[05:10:25] <vampire_weekend> it will insert the same record all over again
[05:11:24] <johnkpaul> vampire_weekend: your checkbox has some jquery event handler attached?
[05:11:33] <vampire_weekend> yes
[05:11:37] <johnkpaul> perhaps try using .one() instead of .click()
[05:11:40] <johnkpaul> ?one @vampire_weekend
[05:11:41] <bot-t1> vampire_weekend, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[05:12:15] <vampire_weekend> this is my fiddle
[05:12:15] <vampire_weekend> http://jsfiddle.net/kYXdR/
[05:14:10] <johnkpaul> so it seems like whatever you do, you should be making sure that your server side validates this as well
[05:14:28] <Nomikos> On jQueryUI->selectable (http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/) does anyone know where the dotted selection rectangle comes from while dragging? I don't see it locally, plugin works fine though
[05:14:46] <johnkpaul> but vampire_weekend, why ar eyou sending your ajax call on change instead of submit of the form?
[05:15:04] <vampire_weekend> I don't have a button
[05:15:35] <vampire_weekend> so it's no convenient methodology?
[05:15:39] <vampire_weekend> Shhhhooots
[05:16:09] <johnkpaul> convenient methodology?
[05:16:17] <johnkpaul> your jsfiddle does have a button
[05:16:17] <vampire_weekend> sorry
[05:16:20] <johnkpaul> it's a button called "go"
[05:16:44] <vampire_weekend> yes I just placed it there cos later I will change
[05:16:55] <vampire_weekend> the alert
[05:17:04] <vampire_weekend> to the color of the button
[05:17:18] <vampire_weekend> I don't think I'm heading on the right track
[05:17:33] <johnkpaul> Nomikos: I don't know, but now I really do want to know
[05:18:50] <johnkpaul> Nomikos: I think that it is the div with class "ui-selectable-helper"
[05:18:56] <johnkpaul> that gets appended to the dom while the selection is happening
[05:19:02] <johnkpaul> are you using the default jqueryui css file?
[05:19:07] <johnkpaul> I bet that includes it
[05:19:14] <Nomikos> hmmmmmm....
[05:19:24] <Nomikos> I am not, I was afraid it'd be something like that
[05:19:36] <johnkpaul> vampire_weekend: I don't think that you should be sending an ajax call every time you change the value of the input, if the form will be sumbitted latter
[05:19:44] <johnkpaul> Nomikos: that's ok, just downlaod that css, and see how it does it
[05:19:51] <johnkpaul> you don't have to use the whole file to get that effect
[05:20:17] <vampire_weekend> that would cost time cos I'm no jQuery expert I get confused everytime
[05:20:21] <vampire_weekend> meepmeep
[05:21:10] <johnkpaul> vampire_weekend: are you modifying someone elses code or building this yourself? that code is fairly advanced for someone who is no expert and gets confused every time
[05:21:31] <vampire_weekend> I made it myself
[05:21:40] <Nomikos> johnkpaul: yep, it's something to do with that :-) when I add a style rule for it a new rectangle appears with those properties. not at the right place of course :-p but that'll be it then
[05:21:50] <alystair> I'm getting Access-Control-Allow-Origin errors while developing on local machine, how do I get around this?
[05:22:06] <Nomikos> johnkpaul: now that I know where to look I'll save it for later though, thanks
[05:22:15] <alystair> (on ajax stuff)
[05:22:43] <Nomikos> alystair: are you specifying the ajax file with a full url?
[05:22:50] <johnkpaul> Nomikos: no problem, have fun, all you probably need to do is add "position-absolute;border:1px dotted black;" go that class
[05:23:06] <alystair> no... it's on my local machine? :S
[05:23:29] <johnkpaul> alystair: those errors would only happen if your ajax call is made to a url outside of the same origin policy
[05:23:30] <Nomikos> alystair: yah ok, just double-checking. that's odd, then
[05:23:38] <johnkpaul> the most common non obvious reason for this is http requesting to https
[05:23:47] <Nomikos> not using the <base href=''> tag either?
[05:24:37] <Nomikos> johnkpaul: damn, that was too easy :-p fixed it for me, thanks
[05:25:05] <johnkpaul> :)
[05:25:16] <alystair> Nomikos... nope just $.getJSON('as.json',function(data){ ... in JS
[05:25:56] <alystair> "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.'
[05:26:22] <johnkpaul> alystair: oh
[05:26:26] <johnkpaul> are you on chrome
[05:26:29] <alystair> yep!
[05:26:30] <Nomikos> hmmm.. are you loading the current page directly, as in file:/// ?
[05:26:31] <johnkpaul> and is this using the filesystem
[05:26:38] <johnkpaul> yeah, Nomikos, I think that's it
[05:26:41] <alystair> yes filesystem and on chrome
[05:26:44] <johnkpaul> the file protocol isn't handled the same way
[05:26:46] <alystair> yeah directly
[05:26:47] <johnkpaul> as http
[05:26:51] <johnkpaul> serve it
[05:26:53] <johnkpaul> and it'll be fine
[05:26:57] <alystair> :/
[05:27:06] <alystair> no way to override this eh
[05:27:13] <johnkpaul> the easiest way to do that for me is python -m SimpleHTTPServer
[05:27:23] <johnkpaul> that just throws up the current filesystem dir to localhost:8000
[05:27:30] <johnkpaul> no code or config whatsoever
[05:27:33] <johnkpaul> really  nice for quick development
[05:27:36] <Nomikos> alystair: unless you want to get into padded JSON :-)
[05:27:37] <johnkpaul> alystair: not in chrome
[05:27:54] <Nomikos> johnkpaul: neat trick, that
[05:27:56] <johnkpaul> or JSONP as Nomikos said, but that'd _defintiely_ need a server
[05:27:57] <mo0nykit> I have a DOM element whose visibility I can toggle. Its height is normally bigger than the window height. How do I prevent automatic scrolling when I display that element?
[05:28:09] * alystair loads up wamp -_-
[05:28:10] <johnkpaul> Nomikos: yeah, it's really useful for us front end people
[05:28:14] <Nomikos> oooh, he's not using a server at all
[05:28:24] * alystair is supremly lazy
[05:28:26] <johnkpaul> alystair: if you have python installed, don't go through the time
[05:28:48] <johnkpaul> I guess in windows you might not
[05:29:10] <johnkpaul> mo0nykit: what do you mean automatic scrolling?
[05:29:12] <alystair> hmmm I have it installed...
[05:29:26] <johnkpaul> there should be an added scrollbar, but not any movement of the page just because of visibility:viible
[05:29:32] <Nomikos> alystair: if you have enough RAM/CPU (and who doesn't, these days), you might look into virtualbox/vmware for webdev stuff
[05:30:00] <Nomikos> but python might be easier, I have no experience there
[05:30:05] <johnkpaul> mo0nykit: also, this might be a more appropropriate question in #css
[05:30:08] <Nomikos> (for this usecase, anyway)
[05:30:19] <mo0nykit> johnkpaul: For example, I'm at the top of the page, then I toggle the display that TALL element. When I display it, the window automatically scrolls to the bottom.
[05:31:24] <mo0nykit> johnkpaul: I already set the CSS to html, body {overflow: hidden}, so I figured some JS or jquery might do the trick. Any idea?
[05:31:35] <Nomikos> hey, that SimpleHTTPServer trick works here too, neat
[05:31:49] <alystair> wtf I have a webserver running on port 80 already
[05:32:12] <johnkpaul> mo0nykit: then something else is not overflow hidden, can you show a jsfiddle live example?
[05:32:18] <johnkpaul> Nomikos: yeah, it shoudl work pretty much everywhere
[05:32:42] <Tobbi> Does anyone know why my AJAX request won't work from Safari, but does in firefox?
[05:32:45] <mo0nykit> johnkpaul: I'll try to overflow hidden the tall element
[05:33:03] <Nomikos> Tobbi: not without more info
[05:33:28] <mo0nykit> johnkpaul: no good. Let me type up a jsfiddle
[05:33:33] <Tobbi> Nomikos, I can give you an example code, if that would help, although it's embedded into the source of my webserver, so it wouldn't help much as standalone.
[05:34:04] <Nomikos> Tobbi: though, one thing I know is Safari is more picky about mimetypes, if you're using PHP try adding header('Content-Type: application/json');
[05:34:28] <Nomikos> (or maybe that only helps to make it /entirely/ validating..)
[05:34:36] <Tobbi> I think it's Python.
[05:35:32] <Tobbi> Nomikos, The code is this: https://github.com/mozilla/kitsune/pull/545/files#L0R384
[05:35:33] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on kitsune by tobbi (2d, 18h ago): Auto Complete functionality for the article field in Kitsune
[05:36:32] <Nomikos> Why are you using XMLHttpRequest when there's jQuery to normalize the browser differences?
[05:36:55] <Nomikos> See if the Safari web inspector spits out any errors
[05:37:41] <Tobbi> Nomikos: I was using XHR to see if it changes anything. And, to be honest, the second part works.
[05:37:49] <Tobbi> It's the first $.ajax that doesn't work.
[05:39:26] <mo0nykit> johnkpaul: See this http://jsfiddle.net/KtX2T/
[05:40:14] <Nomikos> Tobbi: nothing wrong that I can see, but that doesn't mean that much.. web inspector say anything?
[05:40:33] <Tobbi> Unfortunately not.
[05:40:51] <Tobbi> I'll try forcing the request method to GET, not sure if jquery does it automatically.
[05:41:11] <Nomikos> Can you see the ajax request go through, and come back?
[05:41:46] <Tobbi> hold on.
[05:42:31] <mo0nykit> Is there some way I can prevent the window from scrolling automatically? http://jsfiddle.net/KtX2T/2/
[05:42:49] <Tobbi> Nomikos, I can see it go through. The Network tab says something with the URL.
[05:43:02] <Tobbi> And in the console window of my web server, I definitely see a request for that URL.
[05:43:48] <Tobbi> Hold on.
[05:44:03] <Tobbi> This looks weird, I need to investigate.
[05:44:33] <Nomikos> Debugging step #1: get as much information as you can :-)
[05:44:48] <Nomikos> for which web inspectors are great
[05:45:48] <Nomikos> mo0nykit: it's not happening with my browser (FF). what you /could/ do if needed, is save the current scrolling position at the start of the event, and re-set it to that at the end
[05:46:07] <Nomikos> bit of a hack, but it may work for your case/browser
[05:46:08] <Tobbi> Nomikos, For some reason, the query returns no results.
[05:46:17] <Tobbi> However, it does on Firefox
[05:46:32] <Nomikos> Tobbi: could it be dependent on session/cookies?
[05:46:36] <mo0nykit> Nomikos: Thanks, I'll look it up
[05:47:07] <Tobbi> Nomikos, No, it's the locale of the browser. I simply fail.
[05:47:24] <Tobbi> It works because one browser is en-US and the other is de (where it doesn't work)
[05:47:38] <Nomikos> huh. that's not the first place I'd have looked either
[05:48:10] <scalebyte> I have something like this:  checkAllCommunities = $(".knome-check-all-communities") how can I add one more class to it?
[05:48:21] <Tobbi> I will try to translate the one article into German (or at least have a test document).
[05:48:25] <Tobbi> then see if that works.
[05:48:37] <Nomikos> scalebyte: $('.foo, .bar') just like in CSS
[05:48:52] <scalebyte> Nomikos: thanks
[05:50:20] <Innocentus> hi
[05:50:22] <Innocentus> anyone here? :)
[05:50:39] <Nomikos> about 844 people, give or take
[05:55:23] <johnkpaul> mo0nykit: what browser are you using
[05:55:28] <johnkpaul> I do not see that behavior in CHrome 17
[05:55:30] <johnkpaul> on osx
[05:55:43] <johnkpaul> when I hit spacebar, my window stays where it is
[05:55:54] <johnkpaul> also, you're using .toggle() which is using the display property, not the visibility property
[05:56:02] <johnkpaul> which is what I thought you said originaly
[05:58:09] <alystair> ok so now I got the ajax loading from local http... except $.ajax,.get etc don't actually run the function once the json is grabbed? :|
[05:59:18] <alystair> success callback never.. called?
[05:59:30] <johnkpaul-afk> alystair: have you checeked the error callback?
[06:01:18] <Innocentus> there is a div with a horizontal scrollbar
[06:01:45] <alystair> hrm looks like an error :P
[06:03:16] <alystair> how do I get the actual error to show
[06:03:22] <mo0nykit> johnkpaul-afk: I'm using the latest Chrome on OSX
[06:03:30] <alystair> jquery site doc isn't really specific
[06:07:10] <alystair> nvm got it
[06:07:15] <alystair> the UI of this site is crazy :/
[06:08:07] <Innocentus> now I want to add two arrows which scrolls the scroll view of the div to left and to right
[06:08:09] <Innocentus> there is a div with a horizontal scrollbar
[06:08:19] <Innocentus> and it should be a soft scrolling
[06:08:32] <Innocentus> when the right side or left side is reached, the content should wrap over
[06:08:36] <Innocentus> like an endless content
[06:10:52] <Hephaistos> anyone here familiar with node.js?
[06:11:27] <alystair> Hephaistos - how about #node.js
[06:11:40] <Hephaistos> no-one around right now
[06:12:10] <Hephaistos> I don't have a problem
[06:12:21] <Hephaistos> just want to talk about node, I'm curious about it
[06:17:05] <mo0nykit> johnkpaul-afk: Dang! It was caused by the SmoothScroll extension on Chrome. It works as I wanted it to on Safari
[06:25:10] <lopret> hi
[06:25:27] <lopret> is there any way to using td colspan with jquery datatables ?
[06:26:16] <Innocentus> Hi
[06:27:02] <Innocentus> I want that images in LIs in an UL list are downloades sequentially - image in first LI is downloaded first, then image in second LI etc
[06:27:18] <Innocentus> how can I do this with JQuery because appearently this cannot be done without JavaScript, right?
[06:28:30] <Innocentus> anyone?
[06:28:59] <lopret> you can code javascript for it
[06:29:50] <LeMike> Hi there. I like to have a reference to an object that i add. But "var ref= $('#foo').append('<p>');" doesn't give me that, even if i seperate them in two variables the rference is somehow lost. how do i solve this?
[06:31:42] <Nomikos> Innocentus: also, jQuery *is* JavaScript, so if it can not be done in JS it's unlikely to be able with jQuery
[06:31:55] <Innocentus> yes
[06:31:58] <Innocentus> you are right
[06:32:00] <Nomikos> s/able/possible/
[06:32:19] <Innocentus> but it is possible to force a sequential loading of images depending on their order in an UL li?
[06:32:22] <Innocentus> would be cool
[06:33:08] <Nomikos> my first guess would be to hand the image loading to JS instead of having it done automatically by the browser - you'd give an array of image urls to JS, have it create Image objects for them, set the src, and attach an onload event that puts them in the DOM
[06:33:32] <lopret> Innocentus: you can do it
[06:33:37] <Nomikos> .. if, of course, that is not more hassle than it's worth :)
[06:33:38] <lopret> it s simple
[06:33:49] <lopret> first get the ul tag second count li tag
[06:33:57] <lopret> and add trigger to li tag
[06:34:03] <lopret> and start one by one
[06:34:21] <Innocentus> ok
[06:34:29] <Innocentus> what kind of trigger? a downloaded-trigger?
[06:34:35] <Innocentus> the images should also downlad in background
[06:34:52] <Nomikos> LeMike: create the object as a jQuery object first, then append it?
[06:35:00] <lopret> for example
[06:35:17] <lopret> <li>< a href="imageurl"></a></li>
[06:35:19] <Nomikos> LeMike: then you should still have the created-variable name as reference
[06:35:42] <lopret> var n = $('#UlList > li').size();
[06:36:14] <lopret> for(i=0; i<n; i++ ) {  send ajax get request to server download file to browser }
[06:37:11] <lopret> trigger mean when you finished download create a object
[06:37:20] <lopret> for flagging
[06:37:37] <lopret> and check it from control loop
[06:37:48] <Nomikos> I think setting an img.src also triggers downloading the image? if you do it with ajax you end up with a large binary blob instead
[06:38:08] <Nomikos> which, well, you could use that in a data-url, but..
[06:38:43] <lopret> if you know about coding or programming
[06:38:47] <lopret> you can do it
[06:39:02] <lopret> if you dont know it mus be pain in the pass :)
[06:39:16] <Nomikos> sure, but foo = new Image; foo.src = theURL; might be easier :)
[06:39:36] <lopret> Nomikos: maybe but it has a lot of way to do it
[06:39:39] <Nomikos> looping through the LI's is the same, of course
[06:39:43] <Nomikos> right
[06:40:16] <lopret> for example i am in a dead end
[06:40:30] <lopret> there is no way to exit
[06:41:11] <lopret> how can i use td colspan with datatables i dont know datatables plugin support colspan
[06:41:25] <Nomikos> never used those, sorry
[06:41:28] <lopret> my english is not enough for this
[06:42:19] <raj> why can't I do .css on an element that's created by js?
[06:42:34] <K3|Chris> raj: you can
[06:43:44] <raj> it isn't working for some reason
[06:44:11] <K3|Chris> ydiw
[06:44:15] <K3|Chris> fiddle it
[06:44:55] <raj> $('.single').css("background-color", "red");
[06:45:00] <Innocentus> lopret: thank you
[06:45:08] <Innocentus> lopret: is there also a plugin or should I make an own for this?
[06:45:09] <Nomikos> try backgroundColor
[06:45:09] <raj> but if I put in style.css it works
[06:45:34] <Nomikos> .css() is funny like that, doesn't like '-' in property names. I forget why..
[06:45:39] <Innocentus> lopret: an other thing: can I leave the images inside the lis in ul and remove them with javascript so we get a fallback if javascript is not available?
[06:45:43] <raj> Nomikos, didn't work
[06:45:45] <K3|Chris> Nomikos: because JS is like that
[06:45:59] <lopret> yes you can
[06:46:01] <Nomikos> Yeah, there's a W3C rule about something like that I think
[06:46:11] <K3|Chris> $('.single').css({backgroundColor: "red"});
[06:46:16] <raj> I can make $('body') red
[06:46:31] <Nomikos> raj: you did use an uppercase C for Color, right?
[06:46:38] <lopret> if browser is not support javascript than you cannot remove li because
[06:46:48] <lopret> your javascript code will not work
[06:46:58] <lopret> but you can load images dynamically
[06:47:13] <lopret> if javascript not accepted by browser
[06:47:21] <alystair> is there a way to return json as an array and not an object
[06:47:27] <lopret> load a default content what you want to show
[06:47:41] <lopret> other vise change li html with image data
[06:47:49] <lopret> then start your function
[06:47:50] <raj> Nomikos, yes I did
[06:47:57] <raj> but I'm saying, I can make body red
[06:48:04] <K3|Chris> raj: did you try mine?
[06:48:07] <raj> i can't make this dynamically created div red
[06:48:08] <Innocentus> lopret: I mean, the images are in the LIs by default, but if the browser got javascript, it removes the images before the browser begins to download the images (in wrong order)
[06:48:18] <Innocentus> lopret: and then the javascript will download the images itself and places them in
[06:48:20] <K3|Chris> raj: are you setting the color after you make it?
[06:48:28] <raj> yes
[06:48:54] <raj> actually, no
[06:48:57] <raj> not necessarily
[06:49:14] <raj> how can I make sure it runs only after it's there?
[06:49:57] <lopret> so if browser support javascript you want to download images
[06:50:21] <lopret> if its not images cannot be downloaded
[06:50:27] <lopret> am i understand right ?
[06:52:10] <BinaryKitten> alystair can you clarify your request please?
[06:52:49] <BinaryKitten> JSON technically always does objects.
[06:53:02] <BinaryKitten> but
[06:53:05] <Innocentus> lopret: if the browser doesn't support javascript, the images are downloaded in a wild, non sequential order (what is normal with those browsers)
[06:53:39] <Innocentus> lopret: if the browser does support javascript, the images are removed _before_ the browser can download them in wrong order and the javascript downloads them then in correct, sequential order
[06:53:59] <Innocentus> lopret: the question is, can the javascript remove the images fast enough to prevent a download from the browser
[06:54:04] <lopret> ok first code your content for unsupported browser
[06:54:11] <BinaryKitten> wtf?
[06:54:20] <BinaryKitten> why does it matter that much on the order of download?
[06:54:24] <K3|Chris> Innocentus: you still think we should cater to non-js browsers?
[06:54:25] <lopret> than check it if browser javascript supports
[06:54:42] <lopret> change order and load images one by one
[06:55:02] <lopret> i am assuming he is trying to a photo viewer
[06:55:07] <Innocentus> lopret: is a javascript check necessary at all if the javascript is simply executed and removes the images
[06:55:25] <Innocentus> lopret: well yes, something with many images in a horizontal row
[06:55:54] <Innocentus> lopret: can a javascript remove images on a page _before_ the images are downloaded by the browser?
[06:56:10] <lopret> from different page
[06:56:21] <lopret> you have to control it when user access your webpage
[06:56:53] <Innocentus> lopret: the same page
[06:57:08] <Innocentus> lopret: so a script is started directly when the page is loaded by user
[06:57:27] <Innocentus> lopret: and then it removes the images (which are for non javascript browsers) to prevent that the browser downloads them at all, because this is done by the javascript in correct order
[06:57:40] <lopret> you cant do this on same page
[06:57:42] <alystair> how does one iterate an object
[06:57:47] <lopret> because if browser shows images
[06:57:47] <alystair> trying to figure out how .each() actually works.
[06:57:53] <lopret> it start directly download
[06:58:00] <Innocentus> lopret: so the browser is faster than the script, right?
[06:58:06] <alystair> hard to find in source code :/
[06:58:10] <lopret> eys
[06:58:12] <lopret> yes
[06:58:25] <lopret> you have to check it from another page
[06:58:29] <Innocentus> lopret: damn
[06:58:54] <lopret> because if you do it directly
[06:58:59] <lopret> images loads two times
[06:59:09] <lopret> first browser load images
[06:59:19] <lopret> and second if javascript active javascript download images
[06:59:21] <Innocentus> lopret: yes, this I want to avoid
[06:59:22] <lopret> its sucks
[06:59:34] <lopret> you have to control from another page
[06:59:35] <Innocentus> lopret: so we let the images as they are, right?
[06:59:39] <Innocentus> ok, thank you
[06:59:44] <lopret> yes
[07:01:18] <raj> how do I make a change to all div's with a class, except the one that was clicked?
[07:01:38] <raj> without using var
[07:03:24] <Lynd> raj... you can change css attribute on that class if that what you mean?
[07:03:43] <Lynd> or you mean looping all div with that class to change the content inside of it? or change the style?
[07:04:45] <lopret> raj: search about  .each()
[07:04:47] <lopret> function
[07:06:01] <Innocentus> lopret: There is a DIV which is horizontally scrollable showing three elements at the same time, the user should be able to scroll the items by three at a time (so the three next / previous items are visible) by clicking arrow-images
[07:07:15] <Innocentus> lopret: is there a nice plugin / way for this`?
[07:07:22] <lopret> jquery ui
[07:07:24] <lopret> :D
[07:07:26] <lopret> pagination
[07:07:34] <raj> lopret, I want to change the background of every element with the class .single, except the one that is clicked (this is all in the callback of a click function)
[07:08:21] <lopret> dive a id for your div
[07:10:13] <lopret> function SelectAll( e ) { for(i=0; i<your_div_count; i++ ) if ( your_div_id == e ) continue; addClass(div_id); }
[07:10:43] <lopret> addClass is just a simple function is only adding class to div
[07:10:53] <lopret> you have to code that function
[07:12:33] <K3|Chris> raj: simple, change the color of all of that class, then change it back for $(this)
[07:12:52] <K3|Chris> or make a selector that removes $(this)
[07:12:59] <lopret> K3|Chris: yes this is defintly better and simple solution
[07:13:35] <BinaryKitten> wtf @ that selectAll code
[07:14:09] <K3|Chris> $(".class").not(this).css();
[07:14:15] <K3|Chris> lopret: that should work
[07:14:23] <BinaryKitten> divjqueryresult.not(this).addClass(x)
[07:15:53] <lopret> http://www.datatables.net/forums/discussion/9054/datatables-colspan#Item_1
[07:15:55] <lopret> any idea ?
[07:16:27] <Innocentus> lopret: but in this case, it is paginated scrolling a scrollable div
[07:17:58] <lopret> Innocentus: i am sorry but my english is not enough for understand your  word
[07:18:49] <Innocentus> lopret: what language is your mother tongue?
[07:19:10] <lopret> turkish
[07:21:50] <Innocentus> lopret: can't speak this at all, sorry
[07:21:57] <Innocentus> lopret: but thank you for your help so far :)
[07:22:21] <lopret> maybe francais ?
[07:23:09] <Innocentus> oui :)
[07:23:09] <Innocentus> un peau
[07:23:11] <Innocentus> j'essaie
[07:24:03] <CasW> Does anyone here know whether $.load uses GET or POST?
[07:24:06] <Innocentus> il y a un div scrollable et seulement trois elements peut être visible
[07:25:17] <Innocentus> lopret: en cas l'utilisateur scrolle le div, les prochanies trois elements être fait visible

[07:27:55] <johnkpaul-afk> ?load @CasW
[07:27:55] <bot-t1> CasW, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:28:00] <raj> any idea why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/
[07:28:08] <raj> can I not use randomnumber?
[07:28:13] <johnkpaul-afk> that says that it is equivalent to get
[07:28:28] <Deele> hey, what was that trick, with controlling scroll position of element?
[07:28:55] <johnkpaul-afk> ?eval 10*"hello, raj";
[07:29:00] <bot-t1> johnkpaul-afk: NaN
[07:29:05] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: that's why it doesn't work
[07:29:10] <c00kiemon5ter> hi people
[07:29:11] <CasW> johnkpaul-afk: I was talking about http://api.jquery.com/load/
[07:29:11] <raj> oh
[07:29:19] <raj> so how should one do that?
[07:29:31] <johnkpaul-afk> CasW: sorry, that's actually the link I expected the bot to give you
[07:29:36] <johnkpaul-afk> read that page, and you'll see that it uses get
[07:29:53] <CasW> Ah, okay, thanks
[07:29:54] <c00kiemon5ter> does anyone use/recommends some really simple time/clock and date plugin? just showing the time and date
[07:30:19] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: for loop?
[07:30:27] <raj> there we go :)
[07:30:28] <raj> thanks
[07:30:47] <johnkpaul-afk> :) no problem
[07:33:47] <raj> hmm...still not working here http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/1/
[07:33:52] <Innocentus> How to transform an existing floating inline DIV to a position: absolute one without changing the visible position of it?
[07:33:59] <raj> probablynot noticing something silly
[07:34:19] <raj> i love that I need help creating my example for another issue
[07:34:52] <Barncat> here's an easy one (i think) if anybody's feeling helpful, I just suck at js http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9755162/go-through-large-javascript-array-one-item-at-a-time-to-avoid-timeout-errors
[07:35:30] <Pooky5> hi guys, I have question. How can i select only first element? For example $("#div legend") it select all legend in <div> bat what if I want only the one?
[07:35:35] <Pooky5> *only the first
[07:36:04] <raj> Pooky5, $('#div legend:first') i tihnk
[07:36:06] <raj> *think
[07:36:09] <c00kiemon5ter> .first() ?
[07:36:18] <c00kiemon5ter> css could do it too
[07:36:44] <raj> johnkpaul-afk, do you see an issue with that fiddle?
[07:37:44] <Lynd> Barncat: you will need a function that execute 1 row and return true or false (true if row exist and false if it doesnt)
[07:37:51] <Lynd> then use timer to call the function
[07:37:55] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: you didn't intiialize your loop var
[07:38:04] <Lynd> and a global variable that increment each time until the function return false
[07:38:06] <johnkpaul-afk> i is undefined
[07:38:14] <johnkpaul-afk> ?eval undefined < 100
[07:38:16] <bot-t1> johnkpaul-afk: false
[07:38:21] <Lynd> for (var i = 0; i < myarray.length; ++i) {
[07:38:24] <raj> oh, geez
[07:38:39] <Lynd> oh sry, wrong guy, i was talking about barncat
[07:38:47] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: how do you debug? you need to look into the firebug/chrome step debugger or console.log
[07:38:52] <Pooky5> thanks
[07:39:07] <raj> .list is null?
[07:39:11] <Barncat> thanks Lynd I'll give it a shot
[07:39:35] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/2/
[07:39:37] <johnkpaul-afk> it works
[07:40:01] <Lynd> setInterval('functionName()',1000);
[07:40:10] <Lynd> that would call the function in 1s
[07:40:25] <Lynd> just use timer to recall the function each 10ms or 1ms
[07:40:38] <Lynd> and make function to execute 1 row at a time each time
[07:41:11] <Lynd> so javascript stop and get called back each time, so hopefully it won't receive the question to stop the script cuz it taking to long
[07:41:31] <Innocentus> QUESTION: How can a LI being animated to another UL?
[07:42:04] <raj> johnkpaul-afk, what's the difference btwn http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/2/ and http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/1/ ?
[07:42:08] <Lynd> anotherUL.animate(LI);
[07:42:08] <raj> they look identical
[07:44:19] <Lynd> for(var i;i<randomnumber;i++){
[07:44:26] <Lynd> i isn't initialized
[07:44:49] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: look at like 2 of your js
[07:44:56] <johnkpaul-afk> you write var i;
[07:44:58] <Lynd> for(var i=0;i<randomnumber;i++){
[07:45:04] <Lynd> that the fix
[07:45:05] <johnkpaul-afk> that's equivalent to saying var i = undefined;
[07:45:13] <johnkpaul-afk> and then, in your condition, you're chekcing ...
[07:45:20] <johnkpaul-afk> ?eval var i;i<5;
[07:45:22] <raj> oh, i see
[07:45:23] <bot-t1> johnkpaul-afk: false
[07:45:28] <johnkpaul-afk> it will always be false
[07:45:40] <raj> even though I type it in and click Run, it doesn't actually register the change
[07:45:43] <raj> unless I save
[07:45:46] <raj> even though it shows
[07:45:56] <johnkpaul-afk> are you sure you have jquery selected as the library
[07:46:05] <johnkpaul-afk> on the left of jsfiddle
[07:46:13] <johnkpaul-afk> the /1 link says mootools
[07:46:44] <raj> you are right
[07:46:50] <raj> sorry
[07:47:02] <raj> so, anyway, my actual question is, why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/4/
[07:47:25] <raj> I'm expecting a clicked .single to turn red
[07:47:36] <raj> and not other one be red
[07:48:01] <raj> and if any area that isn't .single is clicked, nothing should be red
[07:48:28] <raj> i'll eventually be trying to have ctrl+click and shift+click to do their usual functions too
[07:49:06] <K3|Chris> .on('click' ? that's not jQ syntax
[07:49:14] <raj> it's new
[07:49:24] <raj> i hope it has good browser support though
[07:49:25] <K3|Chris> what's the point?
[07:49:34] <deed02392> hey guys
[07:49:38] <K3|Chris> what's wrong with .click() ?
[07:49:38] <raj> i dunno, it's apparently preferred
[07:49:54] <Lynd> raj the code does get executed on click
[07:50:03] <Lynd> so it your
[07:50:09] <Lynd> $('.list>.single').removeClass('selected');
[07:50:10] <Lynd> $(this).addClass('selected');
[07:50:12] <Lynd> that is the issue
[07:50:23] <deed02392> I can't get the :last selector modifier to work - both :first and :last give the same element even though the array returned by $('script[type="text/x-template"]#tmpl-track-actions'); returns two elements
[07:50:26] <raj> without the $(document) portion, it works
[07:50:26] <Innocentus> Lynd: so this is enough for an animation? really
[07:50:37] <deed02392> surely that is incorrect?
[07:50:38] <Lynd> as far as i know what is the selected class?
[07:50:40] <Innocentus> Lynd: anotherUL.animate(LI);
[07:51:27] <K3|Chris> I can't make heads or tails of your selectors
[07:51:39] <Innocentus> QUESTION: How can I move an element one up?
[07:51:52] <Innocentus> I want to transform a child to a silbing element
[07:51:55] <deed02392> K3|Chris, me?
[07:52:03] <K3|Chris> no Lynd
[07:52:05] <raj> Lynd, me?
[07:52:06] <deed02392> oh
[07:52:43] <Lynd> [10:50] <Innocentus> Lynd: anotherUL.animate(LI);
[07:52:47] <Lynd> i wasn't serious -_-
[07:52:53] <Lynd> i couldn't comprehend the question
[07:52:54] <deed02392> any thoughts as to what could be wrong with the selector here?
[07:52:56] <Innocentus> ok
[07:53:00] <Innocentus> :)
[07:53:24] <deed02392> the pure fact that the array it returns finds two elements yet both first and last return the same one is some indication to an issue right? a bug in jquery perhaps?
[07:53:30] <Innocentus> Lynd: but could you tell me, how to move an A-Element which is nested inside some containers to the document?
[07:53:34] <Innocentus>  /body
[07:54:35] <Innocentus> QUESTION: How can I move an element from one container to another?
[07:55:40] <raj> Lynd, you're right, it doesn't work with that selector either
[07:55:43] <K3|Chris> appendTo
[07:55:52] <raj> '.list>.single' is valid though
[07:55:53] <raj> no?
[07:56:38] <K3|Chris> valid but the wrong selector for this
[07:56:47] <raj> why's that?
[07:56:48] <K3|Chris> E > F an F element child of an E element
[07:56:53] <raj> i'm trying to select .single
[07:57:05] <K3|Chris> .list.single
[07:57:06] <raj> .single is a child though
[07:57:10] <K3|Chris> it is?
[07:57:23] <raj> yep
[07:57:35] <K3|Chris> ah, did you notice that "this is a test" isn't in a div?
[07:58:03] <raj> how's that possible?
[07:58:13] <raj> it's in .list
[07:58:25] <K3|Chris> yeah but not in .single
[07:58:26] <raj> but why's that matter?
[08:02:25] <Lynd> wont you need 1 click event on each child
[08:02:33] <Lynd> your click event is on the parent?
[08:03:01] <Lynd> and you want to edit the child that was clicked, but i don't well not sure exactly what your trying to do...
[08:03:21] <raj> my click event is on .single
[08:03:24] <raj> afaik
[08:03:45] <raj> i want clicking on .single to make the background red, and make all other .single's not red
[08:03:51] <Lynd> send me the link again
[08:04:00] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/10/
[08:06:08] <K3|Chris> ".on('click', '.single', function(event)" looks wrong to me, and I have no idea what it's supposed to do
[08:06:20] <K3|Chris> do you even have an event function?
[08:06:41] <raj> sure it does
[08:06:52] <raj> function(event){
[08:06:59] <K3|Chris> ...
[08:07:04] <K3|Chris> not what I meant
[08:07:10] <K3|Chris> do you have an actual function named event?
[08:07:13] <K3|Chris> that's what you
[08:07:16] <K3|Chris> you're calling
[08:07:54] <K3|Chris> jslint gives errors
[08:07:58] <raj> huh?
[08:08:05] <K3|Chris> "Problem at line 3 character 9: this is undefined"
[08:08:15] <Lynd> hum your right
[08:08:16] <Lynd> alert($(this).html());
[08:08:19] <Lynd> return hi
[08:08:22] <raj> does jslint not use math?
[08:08:51] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: are you using the code here http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/10/?
[08:09:00] <raj> yeah
[08:09:09] <johnkpaul-afk> ?on
[08:09:10] <bot-t1> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:09:36] <Lynd> what is
[08:09:37] <Lynd> $('.list>.single').removeClass('selected');
[08:09:39] <Lynd> suppose to do?
[08:09:54] <Innocentus> K3|Chris: Chris, will appendTo remove the element from its old container and add it to the new container? The element is already on the page.
[08:09:56] <raj> remove the selected class from all .single elements
[08:09:58] <K3|Chris> removes .selected from .single inside .list
[08:10:11] <raj> and then adds that class to the currently clicked .single
[08:10:14] <K3|Chris> Innocentus: read the documentation
[08:10:24] <Innocentus> ok
[08:11:07] <Lynd> k so
[08:11:07] <Lynd> $(this).addClass('selected');
[08:11:10] <Lynd> doesn't work
[08:11:11] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[08:11:24] <johnkpaul-afk> Lynd: that's because .on binds this to the element that on was added to
[08:11:26] <johnkpaul-afk> so it is the list
[08:11:31] <Lynd> change your css
[08:11:38] <Lynd> .selected {background-color:green;}
[08:11:52] <raj> i've got a mistake
[08:11:56] <raj> in the css
[08:12:03] <raj> .single.selected
[08:12:05] <raj> not .list
[08:12:09] <Lynd> oh that why
[08:12:15] <johnkpaul-afk> ah, yes
[08:12:26] <johnkpaul-afk> I was wrong, this is bound to the individual element
[08:12:41] <K3|Chris> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/17/
[08:12:43] <johnkpaul-afk> maybe event.relatedTarget
[08:12:53] <Lynd> .list.selected {background-color:green;}
[08:12:56] <Lynd> doesn't seem to work
[08:13:01] <Lynd> .selected {background-color:green;}
[08:13:02] <Lynd> work
[08:13:26] <raj> yeah, cuz list doesn't have a selceted class
[08:13:28] <raj> .single does
[08:13:46] <raj> however, notice that adding in the $(document) line makes it not work?
[08:13:51] <Lynd> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/18/
[08:14:06] <Lynd> does that work better?
[08:14:47] <raj> that's the same
[08:14:53] <Lynd> oh sry
[08:14:53] <Lynd> .single.selected {
[08:15:04] <Lynd> k what your issue?
[08:15:12] <raj> ok, but adding the $(document) line kills it
[08:15:48] <raj> that line is supposed to remove the selected class from any .single if any area outside of a .single element is clicked
[08:16:01] <Lynd> oh
[08:16:59] <antaranian> hi ladies
[08:18:50] <Lynd> raj
[08:18:51] <Lynd> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/22/
[08:20:01] <raj> it runs the document function anyway
[08:20:05] <Lynd> i know
[08:20:46] <daxroc> Afternoon all
[08:20:54] <Lynd> is there a way to cancel the click event?
[08:21:05] <Lynd> when the click on the first one occur?
[08:21:13] <Lynd> terminate the event, i think i've seen similar code
[08:21:40] <Lynd> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[08:21:44] <johnkpaul-afk> normally, you can use stoppropagation
[08:21:52] <johnkpaul-afk> but using on in this fashion, it's useless
[08:21:52] <daxroc> I'm doing an $.ajax post request, Would doing this across domains fail ?
[08:21:54] <Prajjwal> e.stopPropagation
[08:21:57] <raj> i dunno why i can't just select everything except a class
[08:22:29] <Lynd> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/23/
[08:22:34] <Lynd> fixed
[08:22:48] <Lynd> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/24/
[08:23:05] <Lynd> is that what you want?
[08:23:30] <Prajjwal> raj: You can filter out the class that you dont want - http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[08:24:17] <raj> Lynd, i'm not really liking the code, but yes, that's the functionality i'd like to attain
[08:25:09] <raj> Prajjwal, no, i'd like to select document, except .single
[08:25:20] <raj> not()?
[08:26:46] <Lynd> k well then need to figure out how to filter out a section...
[08:28:02] <Prajjwal> raj: Select whatever elements you want and filter out elements that have a class of single. Read the documentation http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[08:29:08] <raj> Prajjwal, i think that filters in
[08:32:48] <citizenkeys> why doesn't this work: $('.dlg > form').submit(function(event) { $.ajax({ var formValues = $(this).serialize(); type: "POST", url: "forms/index.php", data: formValues, success: function() { $(this).each(function(){ this.reset(); }); } }); });
[08:33:51] <citizenkeys> my issue is that $(this).each(function(){ this.reset(); }); doesn't work.  browser tells me "this.reset is not a function".
[08:35:06] <Lynd> raj: i think your filter for not single does work
[08:35:11] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: and Lynd, I'm sorry, I have to learn to stop trying to say something when I'm really afk
[08:35:15] <johnkpaul-afk> I'm not paying enough attention
[08:35:24] <Lynd> but the issue is when the click is on the single, it get propagated on the background page
[08:35:30] <Lynd> and that one is triggered anyway
[08:36:01] <Lynd> $(document).on('click', ':not("div.single")', function(event){
[08:36:08] <Lynd> get executed 3 times on 1 click
[08:36:10] <alystair> where do I find the .each() iterator?
[08:36:17] <alystair> is there one?
[08:36:49] <Lynd> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[08:37:07] <alystair> not that each
[08:37:09] <alystair> jQuery.each
[08:37:32] <Lynd> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[08:37:40] <citizenkeys> lynd: i had this problem before? it's a pain in the ass...
[08:37:50] <alystair> jQuery.each doesn't have an index var Lynd :|
[08:38:19] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: does this look better http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/26/
[08:38:20] <Lynd> I don't even know what you want to do, you just asked
[08:38:21] <Lynd> where do I find the .each() iterator?
[08:38:28] <citizenkeys> lynd: your solution is to use event.stopImmediatePropagation();
[08:38:49] <Lynd> there shouldn't be an index variabled for a each loop
[08:38:51] <johnkpaul-afk> here, you only bind one event handler to document
[08:39:03] <alystair> Lynd - get the current index #, so if it's on the 2nd pass it should have the value of '2'
[08:39:06] <guest999999> Hey guys, is there a way to check the incoming bytes of an AJAX request before it's completed?
[08:39:07] <Lynd> citizenkeys: raj want a better solution
[08:39:38] <Lynd> citizenkeys: i'm the one who gave him the stoppropagation method -_- your just repeating what i said earlier
[08:39:55] <citizenkeys> lynd: event.stopImmediatePropagation() will solve the problem real quick.  event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation() won't necessarily work.
[08:40:11] <johnkpaul-afk> guest999999: you mean like to display a progress meter?
[08:40:20] <guest999999> johnkpaul-afk: yup :)
[08:40:28] <citizenkeys> event.stopPropagation() and event.stopImmediatePropagation() are not the same thing.
[08:40:29] <Lynd> actually, event.stopPropagation() does work for this case
[08:40:46] <johnkpaul-afk> using XHR on it's own, I don't believe so, I think that only the readystates are what you can bind to
[08:40:46] <Lynd> as it is the current event that need to be stopped and it goes from top object to bottom object
[08:40:54] <citizenkeys> my question is, why doesn't this work: $('.dlg > form').submit(function(event) { $.ajax({ var formValues = $(this).serialize(); type: "POST", url: "forms/index.php", data: formValues, success: function() { $(this).each(function(){ this.reset(); }); } }); });
[08:40:57] <Lynd> so till it the top div that he want, it should work
[08:41:21] <guest999999> johnkpaul-afk: well, I don't have to bind to a state if I can just check the incoming bytes on a timeout interval
[08:41:38] <johnkpaul-afk> guest999999: well, readystates are all you can bind too
[08:41:40] <johnkpaul-afk> to*
[08:41:42] <alystair> Lynd - I'm using objects not arrays, how would I get the current iteration value of the each function?
[08:41:45] <johnkpaul-afk> guest999999: is this for a fileupload?
[08:41:48] <Lynd> guest999999: you can't check the 2nd byte of the data your receiving... as far as I know...
[08:41:55] <Lynd> it only work when received entirely
[08:41:56] <johnkpaul-afk> if so, there are many xhr/flash solutions out there
[08:42:07] <johnkpaul-afk> yeah, Lynd is right, it is only when the readystate changes
[08:42:09] <Lynd> I believe there a function to get the size of the data, so based on the total size you can decide what to do
[08:42:34] <guest999999> johnkpaul-afk: this is for async request data from server, not upload
[08:42:38] <Lynd> the header variable can be obtained without downloading the content
[08:42:40] <alystair> with arrays you get a numerical index by default, not so with objects... guess I should need to create my own enumerator?
[08:42:55] <johnkpaul-afk> guest999999: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/progress/raw-file/tip/Overview.html
[08:43:03] <johnkpaul-afk> it's coming in the future, what you need exactly
[08:43:13] <johnkpaul-afk> I think that FF and chrome already support parts of the progressevent interface
[08:43:37] <johnkpaul-afk> guest999999: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/76976/how-to-get-progress-from-xmlhttprequest
[08:45:42] <kaolti> heya everyone
[08:45:54] <kaolti> im using jquery to load page content with the load function and I'm getting Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #/en/hardware-types/routers/
[08:45:58] <guest999999> johnkpaul-afk: hmm... if it's not supported yet then I may continue without it
[08:45:58] <raj> johnkpaul-afk, what's wrong with http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/16/ ?
[08:46:01] <kaolti> the load does work tho, but im getting this error
[08:46:21] <alystair> so there's no way to access the iterator in $.each?
[08:47:18] <alystair> (for arrays this is non-issue, but need the value for objects)
[08:48:34] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: nothing, I thought you didn't find that code understandable or something
[08:49:06] <raj> no, that was Lynd's I wasn't very fond of
[08:49:13] <raj> it worked well, just didn't like the arrangement
[08:49:23] <raj> this code is the code I started with (besides the bugs)
[08:49:34] <raj> taking out the $(document) line makes it work
[08:50:40] <johnkpaul-afk> alystair: what do you mean the iterator
[08:50:57] <johnkpaul-afk> if you pass an non-array object to jQuery.each, you get key,value as parameters
[08:51:35] <johnkpaul-afk> ?eval var obj = {"hello":"alystair"};jQuery.each(obj,function(key,value){/do what you want with key value})
[08:51:38] <bot-t1> johnkpaul-afk: SyntaxError: unterminated regular expression literal
[08:52:15] <johnkpaul-afk> inside that function, key will be "hello" and value will be "alystair"
[08:52:21] <alystair> "hello" = "hello" and not 0,1,2,3,etc...
[08:52:33] <alystair> as it is in arrays
[08:52:46] <johnkpaul-afk> it is exactly what it is in array
[08:52:47] <johnkpaul-afk> s
[08:52:52] <johnkpaul-afk> arrays are numerically indexed objects
[08:52:57] <johnkpaul-afk> so it is giving you key,value
[08:53:09] <johnkpaul-afk> you want to give them an order? objects in javascript are orderless
[08:53:15] <alystair> exactly, and I want a numerical index on an object that doesn't have numbers
[08:53:44] * alystair will just make his own
[08:54:31] <johnkpaul-afk> perhaps http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
[08:54:37] <johnkpaul-afk> I've never used it for this purpose
[08:54:52] <johnkpaul-afk> but you should try it
[08:55:42] <raj> mr. paul, any ideas?
[08:55:47] <alystair> ?eval var o={"test":13,"another":37},i=0;$.each(o,function(k,v){i++;});console.log(i);
[08:55:49] <bot-t1> alystair: 2
[08:55:55] <alystair> well, that was zzz
[08:58:58] <alystair> that's all I needed :|
[08:59:22] <alystair> was just hoping that $.each had a built-in numerical index, which I guess it does but isn't accessible
[09:01:41] <kenthree> how can I get [checked] to return elements with the attribute checked?
[09:01:45] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: you're asking me?
[09:01:50] <kenthree> it seems it only works for one that have the property set too
[09:01:56] <johnkpaul-afk> say the persons whole nick, and then they'll notice faster
[09:02:17] <johnkpaul-afk> what is the problem? I thought that Lynd's solution worked for you
[09:02:46] <johnkpaul-afk> kenthree: isn't the jquery extension selecter called ":checked"?
[09:03:08] <kenthree> checked returns boxes that are truly checked
[09:03:25] <Munger> Hi. I'm populating a nav bar from an ajax call like so --- http://paste.pocoo.org/show/567453/     How can I assign the click function to each element added?
[09:03:35] <kenthree> but imagine a poorly made framework adds the attribute checked without actually ticking, what then?
[09:03:59] <raj> johnkpaul-afk, yes
[09:04:41] <raj> I'd like for a click on anything except for .single to removeClass('selected') from all .single's
[09:04:44] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/16/
[09:04:58] <johnkpaul-afk> didn't I send you a solution to that a while ago
[09:05:02] <raj> currently, the $document line doesn't work
[09:05:08] <raj> no? i musta missed it
[09:05:09] <johnkpaul-afk> kenthree: look into .prop
[09:05:29] <Lynd> raj you can make that the .list click event stop the propagation of the click
[09:05:31] <johnkpaul-afk> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/26/
[09:05:33] <Lynd> instead of the .single
[09:05:49] <johnkpaul-afk> or what Lynd said
[09:06:16] <raj> cool
[09:06:17] <kenthree> johnkpaul-afk: yeah, i'm using jquery mobile which appaently isnt using prop correctly, so I have checkboxes with the attribute check="checked" but element.checked (the property) is false
[09:06:32] <raj> Lynd, i think I was avoiding stopPropagation
[09:06:32] <kenthree> typo^ checked*
[09:06:50] <raj> i don't feel comfortable I think cuz i don't understand why it's propagating
[09:06:52] <johnkpaul-afk> oh wow kenthree, jq mobile has a bug like that?
[09:06:55] <Lynd> oh nice johnkpaul, i had that in my head but didn't knew how to put it down
[09:07:27] <johnkpaul-afk> thanks, so raj, does that code make sense to you?
[09:07:35] <raj> yes
[09:07:38] <Lynd> raj just thing about a div in a div in a div, a click on the top div will be triggered for a click in all the div below it including the main page as a click
[09:07:38] <raj> sure does
[09:07:39] <raj> thank you
[09:07:42] <johnkpaul-afk> kenthree: I'm surprised, but maybe it's just something I don't understand, prop should do it
[09:07:45] <Lynd> it propagate from top to bottom
[09:08:13] <raj> Lynd, k
[09:08:20] <raj> i thik that makes a little more sense now
[09:08:21] <rocktop> hi how to make this popup closed after the specify time ? http://jsfiddle.net/84VzA/
[09:08:43] <Munger> How do you assign a click function to a dynamically created item?
[09:08:58] <raj> the reason I was trying to separate the code though, is because now I'm trying to create a ctrl+click function
[09:09:03] <raj> johnkpaul-afk ^^
[09:09:19] <Lynd> munger...
[09:09:20] <raj> and your code combines the click functinoality with clicking outside .single
[09:09:23] <Lynd> just look at this
[09:09:23] <Lynd> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/4/
[09:09:38] <Lynd> he add a click event dynamically and tell what function to be called
[09:11:05] <Munger> Lynd, Isn't that adding the function to the entire list and not the individual elements?
[09:11:14] <johnkpaul-afk> so raj, check for the keyup event in another handler
[09:11:18] <johnkpaul-afk> ?keyup @raj
[09:11:19] <bot-t1> raj, .keyup(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keyup" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[09:11:21] <Lynd> it add the function to all element of the class
[09:11:24] <Lynd> for that one indeed
[09:11:30] <johnkpaul-afk> I actually need to head out, but I'll be back, good luck raj and kenthree

[09:52:24] <Nomikos> rocktop: try http://jsfiddle.net/84VzA/8/ - the first two lines can go outside the jQuery $(function) stuff
[09:52:43] <Nomikos> rocktop: that works in local testing, I can't get it to work in jsfiddle also somehow
[09:54:06] <Innocentus> HI
[09:54:08] <rocktop> Nomikos: ok checking ...
[09:54:09] <Innocentus> QUESTION: $(\'#selected\').prepend(\'<li></li>\');
[09:54:18] <Innocentus> How can I get the prepended instance?
[09:54:19] <Innocentus> directly, I mean
[09:54:34] <Innocentus> because var test = $(\'#selected\').prepend(\'<li></li>\'); will lead to an instance to #selected, not to li
[09:54:34] <Innocentus> please help
[09:55:24] <Nomikos> .children(':first') or somesuch, I forget
[09:55:27] * Nomikos tries
[09:55:37] <K3|Chris> :first-child
[09:56:15] <erebel55> ngharo: hmm well i set the viewBox but i'm still having trouble getting it http://jsfiddle.net/p3vq5/23/
[09:56:17] <K3|Chris> http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/ - http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/ - http://api.jquery.com/first/
[09:56:21] <erebel55> thank you for pointing that out
[09:56:34] <Nomikos> http://jsfiddle.net/4vvwy/6/
[09:57:47] <erebel55> i'm starting to wonder if viewBox is the best way to implement zooming
[09:58:26] <Innocentus> Nomikos: and I thought I can directly get instance of the newly created element
[09:58:35] <Innocentus> ok, so I will do it afterwards with a selector.
[09:59:04] <Nomikos> Innocentus: most jQuery methods return the object on which they were called
[09:59:20] <Innocentus> alright
[09:59:22] <Innocentus> thank you
[09:59:37] <Innocentus> damn
[09:59:40] <Nomikos> the ones that don't mostly sit under http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[10:00:44] <Nomikos> Can anyone see why this /doesn't/ work? http://jsfiddle.net/4vvwy/7/
[10:01:05] <ngharo> erebel55: hmm that's weird.  I can see the attributes on the dom element
[10:01:30] <ngharo> erebel55: http://jsfiddle.net/p3vq5/25/ here's a different way to get it
[10:02:35] <daxroc> Can you post data using $.ajax cross domain ?
[10:02:58] <Nomikos> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[10:03:05] <kenthree> you cannot
[10:03:05] <Nomikos> daxroc: ^
[10:03:31] <daxroc> Nomikos: JSONP uses get not POST
[10:03:41] <Nomikos> darn
[10:04:01] <erebel55> ngharo: thanks so much, so i shouldn't use the split function then? is this an ok method for implementing svg zooming or would you go about it a different way?
[10:04:30] <daxroc> kenthree: what about building a form and having jquery submit it ?
[10:04:47] <ngharo> erebel55: i have absolute zero experience with SVGs
[10:04:52] <Nomikos> daxroc: then I'd use serverside code as a proxy, and ajax to that
[10:04:59] <daxroc> nm, didn't think that one out
[10:05:22] <ngharo> erebel55: but yes, you dont have to split anything; you have all four viewbox values as .x, .y, .height and .width
[10:05:41] <daxroc> Nomikos: not an option.
[10:06:23] <erebel55> ngharo: right, thanks so much :)
[10:06:27] <daxroc> posibly create an iframe build a form and have jquery submit it ?
[10:06:47] <daxroc> *hidden
[10:07:06] <Nomikos> daxroc: you don't have a serverside language that can post data and accept the results?
[10:07:41] <ngharo> erebel55: css zoom is another possible option
[10:07:59] <erebel55> i'll look that up
[10:09:01] <daxroc> Nomikos: I do, it's not the problem. The ajax requests arent refered from a client html5 app so a proxy wouldn't work in this instance.
[10:09:22] <daxroc> *arent - are
[10:09:35] <Nomikos> daxroc: I didn't mean an actual proxy server, sorry, just the concept
[10:10:06] <Nomikos> ajax to your own server with the required data, have php (say) post that to the remote server, accept the results, send those back to jQuery
[10:10:16] <kenthree> I think he wants the app to be 100% autonomous
[10:10:35] <Nomikos> then I yield.
[10:12:06] <daxroc> Nomikos: Thats a proxy tho , app  -> my server code -> remote -> myserver code -> app. That works for most it's just that the requsting side is remote to my server there not on the same domain. So that method doesn't work
[10:13:50] <Nomikos> ah right
[10:16:31] <ngharo> daxroc: is your app running local file:// or something?
[10:18:47] <daxroc> ngharo: no, its running on an embeded browser
[10:19:03] <daxroc> ngharo: much like air
[10:20:12] <ngharo> so it's still being served up via a webserver, right?
[10:20:51] <daxroc> ngharo: yes, I can only use javascript / html on that server.
[10:21:05] <erebel55> dang my context menu got messed up now that I added zoom. now it appears when i right click anywhere on the screen. I only want it to appear when i right click on the svg. http://jsfiddle.net/p3vq5/31/
[10:21:19] <ngharo> daxroc: no php? that's lame
[10:35:19] <TheRiot> Does anyone have a solution to this issue?  http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10014
[10:38:42] <snover> TheRiot: the solution to that issue is to understand how javascript works and use it correctly
[10:38:43] <bot-t1> (2 hours 28 mins ago) <rmurphey> tell snover you should put your article in google docs or something so i can add comments
[10:40:52] <TheRiot> how am I using it incorrectly?
[10:45:43] <lahwran> how would I run a function on all elements selected?
[10:45:51] <lahwran> I want to reverse the content of all selected elements
[10:46:10] <TheRiot> snover, could you give me a term or something I could google?
[10:47:35] <lahwran> oh .each()
[10:52:23] <snover> TheRiot: as far as I can tell that issue is complaining that jQuery does not clone the prototype of an instance of an object
[10:52:50] <nFFF> TheRiot can't you just prototype myclass ?
[10:53:04] <nFFF> and make b a new object of it myclass
[10:53:23] <snover> though it is kind of hard to tell
[10:53:32] <snover> and there was no testcase
[10:53:59] <TheRiot> I have an object with a class inside.  That just looked similar to what I have.
[10:54:07] <raj> how do I say if there is a click NOT on an element of a particular class, do something
[10:54:42] <RachelR> Trying to return my JSON values into JQuery buttons.  Anyone see why this is returning a 'button is not defined' error in phonegap?  Completely new to jquery, I apologize if it's an easy error I am over looking http://somobetech.com/jqscript.txt
[10:55:23] <nFFF> raj, $(document).on('click', function(e){ if (e.target.className != 'hai') { alert('ohhai') });
[10:55:33] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all. Could someone advise me on the best way to implement the toggle method for a custom animation to "show" or "hide" a div. It would show on click, hide on a child(.closeButton)'s click.
[10:55:37] <Nomikos> RachelR: you have to initialize button before using it
[10:56:04] <RachelR> Is the initialization outside of the loop?
[10:56:19] <Nomikos> RachelR: yeah, just go var button = ""; or so
[10:56:34] <nFFF> TheRiot, put your code on jsfiddle.net
[10:56:44] <RachelR> Thank you, I'll give it a shot
[10:57:10] <Nomikos> RachelR: and I'm guessing you want $("#content").append(button);, but outside the loop as well
[10:57:27] <Nomikos> or you'll get a lot of duplicate buttons, seems to me
[10:58:15] * Nomikos gives up on his script and goes to find food
[11:03:11] <RachelR> crap, now it's complaining about not being able to pull the data.
[11:04:17] <RachelR> http://www.somobetech.com/jqscript.txt  --ERROR: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined at file
[11:04:37] <imsky> sunday sunday sunday
[11:07:56] <nFFF> RachelR, your using the value in the json as an array?
[11:08:26] <TheRiot> okay, I have something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/5mbdL/
[11:08:33] <Whirl3d> how do I get the css definition of a class that I have not assigned?
[11:08:57] <RachelR> Took that out, it's now -- button += '<a href="#" data-role="button">' + project.name + '</a>';
[11:09:31] <RachelR> Doesn't result in any errors, but there aren't any buttons on my emulator either :( ha
[11:09:32] <nFFF> RachelR, do console.log(json.results)
[11:09:37] <nFFF> and see what it returns
[11:09:52] <nFFF> also you are doing button += and then appending it
[11:10:11] <nFFF> within the each loop, you do realise it's going to end up with a fuck load of duplicate button
[11:10:21] <nFFF> you don't need the += I assume
[11:10:31] <RachelR> No I don't
[11:10:55] <RachelR> I'm taking examples from all over the map and forget to update - my bad.
[11:11:31] <Barncat> this is so stupid but I've been stumped on it all morning, can anybody show me (specifically) how to process this array one item at a time so I don't get timeout errors?  http://pastebin.com/JkFVDVmy
[11:12:35] <nFFF> TheRiot, and whats the issue
[11:14:42] <TheRiot> I'd like "template.position.width" to stay at "100px"
[11:15:14] <TheRiot> how could I clone "template" in a way that would allow that
[11:16:10] <RachelR> Still no buttons show, but not Errors either
[11:16:59] <nFFF> RachelR, log your json to the console to check the id's/values....
[11:18:38] <snover> TheRiot: you’d have to do it yourself. jQuery.extend doesn’t do anything for non-plain objects
[11:19:04] <raj> thanks nFFF
[11:19:10] <raj> what is e.target, btw?
[11:19:35] <raj> cuz click already has a selector
[11:19:40] <raj> so what's the use for e.target?
[11:19:44] <nFFF> native javascript event property
[11:20:00] <TheRiot> Okay, understood.  What's the difference between a plain and nonplain object?
[11:20:09] <nFFF> returns the target of your click
[11:20:09] <TheRiot> and thanks!  :)
[11:20:38] <raj> nFFF, does it return the deepest dom node?
[11:21:24] <nFFF> exactly
[11:21:25] <RachelR> Threw the logging in there. --[object Object],[object Object],[object Object] at file:///android_asset/www/index.html:20
[11:21:35] <raj> cool
[11:22:04] <snover> TheRiot: a plain object is…an object
[11:22:05] <snover> {}
[11:22:08] <snover> plain object ^
[11:22:20] <snover> i.e. not an instance of something
[11:22:24] <TheRiot> okay
[11:22:32] <TheRiot> And would this be considered a bug?  Or is it by design?
[11:22:50] <TheRiot> that jQuery.extend doesn't clone non-plain objects
[11:23:23] <snover> who knows. probably by design.
[11:23:51] <TheRiot> alright, thanks again!
[11:25:07] <RachelR> nFFF, is that what you wanted to see in the log?
[11:25:31] <BillyJoe> I load images dynamically. They are large and take ~5 seconds to appear. How can I make the images fadeIn() instead of just displaying at once?
[11:25:50] <raj> nFFF, what's wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/34/
[11:26:04] <raj> once I added the document code at the bottom, it stopped working
[11:26:21] <diegoviola> hi
[11:28:44] <nFFF> raj, the firs issue is all your elements have the class single
[11:29:18] <raj> yeah
[11:29:58] <raj> i want .selected to be removed from all the elements if there is a click not on .single
[11:31:43] <Whirl3d> how do you get the css properties of a class that is not assigned to any element in the dom? I tried cloning an element and applying the class, but it didn't work.
[11:32:49] <nFFF> raj
[11:32:50] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/35/
[11:33:24] <nFFF> Whirl3d, I don't hink you can, just assign it to an empty element and check ?
[11:33:52] <RachelR> Hm, showing [Object object] three times in the log (correct amount).  Is that correct behaviour or should it be logging actual values?
[11:34:11] <raj> nFFF, broke ctrlkey
[11:34:15] <nFFF> raj, I just put else
[11:34:29] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/sH4UH/9/
[11:34:31] <nFFF> but youd probably want to change hat to if (e.target.className == single
[11:34:35] <raj> what do you mean?
[11:34:39] <raj> oh
[11:34:40] <raj> k
[11:35:03] <Whirl3d> I keep getting some error uncaught typeError Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[11:35:29] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/35/
[11:35:49] <raj> that's the same
[11:35:50] <nFFF> RachelR, I have no idea what your server is returning, or the format it's in
[11:36:03] <raj> i think you pressed Run instead of Update
[11:36:37] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/37/
[11:36:46] <raj> still broken in 37
[11:36:53] <nFFF> what is?
[11:37:01] <raj> ctrl key
[11:37:29] <raj> ctrl+click should be making the clicked item toggle
[11:37:54] <RachelR> I've been able to grab the values before and they return w/ any regular HTML attr.  When I add the jQuery "button" is when I can't seem to get it working.
[11:38:39] <RachelR> Just JSON, http://somobetech.com/test.php
[11:39:23] <nFFF> raj, when I press ctrl and click, it removes the green bg?
[11:39:53] <raj> yes
[11:39:58] <raj> but it should be adding it too
[11:40:37] <systemfault> RachelR: What's wrong?
[11:43:08] <RachelR> systemfault, I'm trying to pull JSON values down and put them into Jquery buttons.  No luck so far.  No errors are logged but the emulator shows no buttons either.  http://somobetech.com/jqscript.txt
[11:44:07] <systemfault> RachelR: What browser do you use?
[11:44:24] <systemfault> Have you checked its webinspector?
[11:45:27] <RachelR> I'm using Chrome but does that matter if I'm loading the app into an emulator?  Using phonegap framework
[11:45:41] <systemfault> I don't think it matters
[11:48:12] <nFFF> raj, i see, wierd it should toggle it
[11:48:54] <alystair> is there a way for me to input more than one value for the not equal selector?
[11:50:30] <RachelR> Is there another way to create a button for each JSON value?
[11:51:25] <systemfault> RachelR: You're sure it's not the ajax transaction that fails?
[11:52:05] <RachelR> Let me test it with just plain html attributes
[11:52:24] <nFFF> raj, it should be e.target but that doesn't work either
[11:52:24] <nFFF> wier
[11:54:09] <Whirl3d> does an unattached element have .css properties? I keep getting an error Cannot call method "replace" of undefined when I get the css of an unattached element.
[11:54:43] <systemfault> RachelR: I did some quick tests and curl seems to return me a 406 on that request

[11:56:06] <Whirl3d> nFFF, thanks for the reply. I am familiar with the api. I'm just not sure why it's not working.
[11:56:16] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/sH4UH/16/
[11:56:48] <Whirl3d> I log right before each step until i find the step that is messing up and it's the one where I try to pull the css attributes from the unattached element.
[11:58:26] <nFFF> yea..
[11:58:34] <nFFF> i just told you why..
[11:59:04] <raj> nFFF, any ideas?
[11:59:28] <RachelR> Cool, got it returning the values. but they aren't showing up as jquery buttons, just regular links...
[12:00:34] <Whirl3d> is that new? I thought .css() would return all the css properties. It should at least. Thanks for the reply. Sorry about the hassle
[12:03:13] <nFFF> Yea it doesn't Im not even sure how you would get the all css properties of an element
[12:03:24] <nFFF> if inline it's easy
[12:03:38] <nFFF> but i don't even know if it can be done
[12:03:42] <nFFF> maybe theres a plugin
[12:03:52] <nFFF> raj, sorry not sure why it doesn't work
[12:04:01] <RachelR> Link property is there but doesn't look like the data-role="button" is applying. http://somobetech.com/ss.gif
[12:04:35] <raj> nFFF, what was wrong with my original code?
[12:05:48] <raj> nFFF, I think this one http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/34/
[12:05:55] <raj> it works without the document line on the bottom
[12:06:09] <raj> it seems logical
[12:06:12] <raj> i dunno what I'm missing
[12:06:44] <raj> propagation?
[12:08:40] <RachelR> Is there some reason I'd need to refresh it so it displays correctly?  Just trying to figure out why it'll only pick up the link attribute
[12:12:26] <nFFF> raj, it's strange I honeslty don't know why both don't work
[12:15:49] <raj> nFFF, you know what's funny
[12:16:05] <raj> if I put an alert above the `if` in the document function, it works
[12:16:12] <Whirl3d> Okay, I have this working basically like I want it. but it's a lot of really ugly and unnecessary code, I think. Could someone help me to implement .toggle in this situation. It seams like this could be easily handled with one toggle handler..
[12:16:26] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/sH4UH/25/
[12:16:36] <raj> nFFF, http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/46/
[12:16:53] <Whirl3d> btw, thanks nFF for the css heads up.
[12:16:58] <nFFF> raj
[12:16:59] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/48/
[12:17:30] <raj> nope, still doesn't work
[12:18:10] <nFFF> how?
[12:18:13] <nFFF> it does for me
[12:18:25] <nFFF> wait
[12:18:31] <nFFF> now it doesn't work if you click of it
[12:19:11] <raj> right
[12:19:18] <raj> plus it did something weird by selecting all
[12:19:25] <raj> on the first click
[12:19:36] <raj> i think i'm getting closer with this http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/49/
[12:19:42] <raj> i added stopPropagation
[12:20:00] <raj> but now it doesn't work clicking document
[12:21:03] <raj> what's the opposite of .is()?
[12:21:06] <raj> like isnot() ?
[12:21:21] <raj> i had a typo
[12:21:24] <raj> i think my last one will work
[12:21:30] <raj> if i can do isnot
[12:22:09] <raj> cool
[12:22:11] <raj> it works now
[12:22:22] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/51/
[12:22:36] <raj> thanks nFFF  :)
[12:23:19] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/52/
[12:23:48] <nFFF> ah ok, you got it two, sorry the issue was literally stoppropagation, cant believe i didn't think of that
[12:24:02] <raj> well, I only added that at 50 or something
[12:24:17] <raj> the alert helped me figure out that it was a propagation issue
[12:24:29] <Innocentus_> hi again
[12:24:33] <raj> nFFF, is there an '.isnot' method of some sort?
[12:24:42] <Innocentus_> I am looking for a plugin, is this the right channel for some recommendations?
[12:25:34] <nFFF> ?not
[12:25:35] <bot-t1> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[12:25:36] <Innocentus_> I already asked here before
[12:25:55] <raj> don't think that's the opposite of .is
[12:26:25] <nFFF> it is if you use a jqury object
[12:26:30] <Innocentus_> So before I start writing an own plugin (oh) I would like to be sure that there isn't already something which can be used.
[12:26:34] <nFFF> ?not(jquery object)
[12:26:36] <bot-t1> nFFF, .not() - Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[12:27:11] <Innocentus_> There is a horizontally scrollable div. Now the user should be able to click on arrows < > in order to scroll the div left or right.
[12:27:23] <Innocentus_> This of course can only be done with javascript / jquery
[12:27:55] <nFFF> im so hungover im not even making sense, im going to stop
[12:27:55] <nFFF> gl
[12:28:06] <raj> :)
[12:28:09] <raj> see ya nFFF
[12:28:09] <nFFF> not() should work though
[12:28:11] <raj> thanks again
[12:28:24] <raj> i just changed .is to .className = 'single'
[12:28:30] <raj> for continuity
[12:29:09] <nFFF> Can't you do !$('.foo').is
[12:29:30] <raj> yeah, true that
[12:29:41] <raj> nFFF, i do have a trickier issue i'd like to solve
[12:29:45] <raj> if u have a minute
[12:29:56] <nFFF> Im not sure id be much help right now :D
[12:30:35] <raj> shall i send for a water?
[12:30:43] <raj> :)
[12:33:02] <nFFF> :d
[12:33:07] <nFFF> ill try though
[12:33:10] <nFFF> whats the problem
[12:33:21] <nFFF> If i sit up it may help me concentrate
[12:34:17] <raj> so I'd like for a click made while shift is pressed to add the selected class to all .single elements in btwn and including the clicked item (from the last item that had 'selected' added to its class) http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/54/
[12:35:19] <raj> i probably need an additional class for the last selected item
[12:39:49] <foo> I'm trying to digest how a page works. Is there any tools to see what happens when I click on something/do something on the website? eg. if I click on this tab, it runs this function, located on this file/line, hmm
[12:44:14] <nFFF> raj http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/56/
[12:44:42] <Whirl3d> but raj, since it appears that you are trying to emulate the default behafvior of click, shiftclick and ctrl click on windows, you will have to consider what to do when you shift-click on an element that is a ways from from your original click then shift click on an element on the other side....
[12:45:45] <raj> Whirl3d, good thinking...but I actually don't mind if it just highlights both sides in that case
[12:45:57] <raj> unless you think that'll be annoying
[12:46:38] <Whirl3d> I like it when shift selects between the closest selected item and the clicked item. Regardless of whether it's expanding on one side or the other
[12:46:45] <Whirl3d> Same with deselect method.
[12:47:17] <raj> Whirl3d, but that's what it would currently do
[12:47:24] <raj> nFFF, that doesn't seem to work
[12:47:38] <Whirl3d> If you shift click on an selected element, it should remember the last clicked place and deselect all of them. (whether selected or not)
[12:49:08] <raj> deselect?
[12:49:14] <raj> you mean select?
[12:50:35] <foo> Right now I am working on a site that has tabs that expand a div, using jquery. I'm trying to set up hash tags in the url, so #thistab automatically loads the page with a certain tab expanded. I'm having problems figuring out what code is being executed when the tabs run, though. Any tips on how to find this? Can't seem to find it in chrome web inspector. thanks
[12:52:31] <safire> http://safire.us:3000 <-- can anyone tell me why slideToggle() is instant here?
[12:53:33] <K3|Chris> if it ever loads
[12:54:10] <K3|Chris> I can't see any toggle
[12:54:28] <K3|Chris> how would I activate it?
[12:54:29] <safire> click on the sql query
[12:54:32] <safire> sorry
[12:54:47] <K3|Chris> just takes me to another page
[12:55:18] <safire> It hides it for me..
[12:55:43] <K3|Chris> please fiddle...
[12:55:52] <safire> fiddle?
[12:56:03] <K3|Chris> your site is slow as all hell and I can't find your JS
[12:56:57] <foo> in jquery, how can I activate/simulate a mouse click? eg. I want to say, "take this div and simulate a mouse click, so that whatever events that are supposed to fire on click do so"
[12:57:21] <systemfault> foo: .click() on it
[12:57:35] <foo> systemfault: are you being sarcastic?
[12:57:42] <foo> systemfault: lol, jk. #facepalm. will do ;) thank you
[12:58:29] <daxroc> foo: there is also trigger()
[12:58:49] <systemfault> .trigger('click') is the same as .click()
[13:00:41] <safire> I don't understand how it's slow.. instant for me..
[13:00:47] <foo> daxroc / systemfault - thanks a ton guys :)
[13:06:08] <Whirl3d> raj, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/qqLkJ/77/
[13:06:55] <Whirl3d> by attaching the on handler to the parent list element, your code will be more efficient...one handler instead of +-11

[13:33:31] <Innocentus_> QUESTION: Why is a function not found in f.ex. a mousedown-handler of an html element when it is defined in appendOnReadyScript?
[13:33:52] <raj> Whirl3d, why does using the parent do anything differently?
[13:34:21] <Whirl3d> raj, when you add another element later on, the parent will still be able to handle it
[13:34:36] <raj> what element am I adding?
[13:34:40] <Whirl3d> if you attach it to the individual elements, you have to be sure to bind the element each time.
[13:35:07] <Whirl3d> Also, you can have 11 little .on statements cluttering up memory or 1. Whcih is better?
[13:35:18] <raj> i understand that 1 is better
[13:35:31] <raj> but i wasn't understanding how 1 was being used instead of 11
[13:36:20] <Whirl3d> when assign the .on handler to the parent of the .single items, then the $(e.target) represents the item clicked.
[13:36:27] <Whirl3d> that's only 1 assignment.
[13:37:11] <Whirl3d> the other way, every .single item had its' own .on handler.
[13:37:15] <raj> oh
[13:37:21] <raj> i see what you mean
[13:37:21] <Innocentus_> can anyone help me? :)
[13:37:37] <raj> so e.target can select the deepest element there
[13:37:43] <raj> i like it
[13:37:48] <raj> thanks
[13:37:58] <Whirl3d> innocentus_ is that jquery?
[13:37:59] <raj> Whirl3d, what's with all the math?
[13:38:00] <raj> :)
[13:38:05] <raj> Math.min...?
[13:38:38] <Whirl3d> I found that for some reason if you didn't slice from smalll index to large it would mess up. So Math.min gives you the smaller index
[13:39:06] <Whirl3d> allowing you to select between the smaller index (whether the one clicked or the previous one clicked) and the larger index.
[13:40:25] <Innocentus_> yes
[13:41:16] <Whirl3d> so basically, if you click on item 5 and then click on item 8, no problem it'll slice between (5,8). b ut if you click on 8 and then shift-click on 5, slide(8,5) was messing up. So I took Math.min to get the smaller index and selected slide(5,8) which was our goal.
[13:42:44] <Whirl3d> innocentus, never heard of appendOnReadyScript, nor do I understand what you mean by f.ex.a
[13:43:45] <Whirl3d> *slice not slide. sorry
[13:46:58] <Whirl3d> anybody know of a string list of attributes or propertes that can be set using .css() ?
[14:02:11] <Innocentus_> I got a strange problem: I defined a function in jquery on ready script
[14:02:30] <kaolti> hey everyone
[14:02:32] <Innocentus_> but the function cannot be found when called inside an event handler-attribute f.ex. onclick="function();"
[14:02:37] <Innocentus_> any ideas?
[14:03:02] <mbeenen> the document isn't ready as it's parsing the html, so the function won't be defined at that point?
[14:03:14] <Whirl3d> define the function outside of the ready wrapper
[14:03:39] <kaolti> im using jquery to load() content on my page and changing the url by adding a hash tag. I am getting: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #/en/hardware-types/usb/ , however when I paste the same code in the console it loads just fine without any error
[14:03:45] <kaolti> any idea what could be causing this?
[14:04:36] <Whirl3d> kaoti, that is gonna require a fiddle. It sounds like a scope issue, but without seeing yoru code, there's no way to tell.
[14:04:48] <kaolti> okay gimme a sec
[14:06:13] <kenthree> is there a global function to stop any ajax calls going on?
[14:07:53] <kaolti> kenthree, here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/qXkvG/
[14:08:25] <kaolti> it doesnt work but at least you can take a llook :D
[14:08:26] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[14:08:55] <kenthree> kaolti: I think that was for Whirl3d
[14:09:14] <mbeenen> kenthree: Not that I'm aware of, but you could probably write a simple wrapper function for your ajax calls that holds onto the requests in an array, and then another quick function to abort them all?
[14:09:51] <kenthree> mbeenen: I see..
[14:10:07] <Whirl3d> kaoti, do a console.log(window.location.hash);
[14:10:20] <kaolti> yes sorry, it was for Whirl3d
[14:11:32] <kaolti> caniuse, it doesn't work because it;s supposed to load a part of another page and change the url. Im not sure if that can be done on jsfiddle
[14:13:11] <Whirl3d> kaoti, I think caniuse is a bot designed to catch common claims by channel participants that make it difficult to help. I'm not sure, though
[14:13:29] <uf0_work> sup guys
[14:13:44] <uf0_work> having a bit of an issue here. check this link
[14:13:46] <uf0_work> http://jsfiddle.net/67A9w/3/
[14:13:54] <uf0_work> it works on .click
[14:14:02] <uf0_work> but I want it to work on .hover
[14:14:06] <uf0_work> and nothing happens
[14:14:21] <uf0_work> referring to
[14:14:21] <uf0_work> $('.lead_pagination li').click(function()
[14:14:43] <Whirl3d> kaoti, I would also suggest that you wrap your "mainContent" div in a div that holds both your "loader" div and your "mainContent" . Then, fade your mainContent out completely, show the loader panel, load the content, hide the loader panel, show the main content.
[14:15:44] <Whirl3d> right now you are fading the content to .1 opacity (barely visible) and placing your loading message in it (not hardly visible) and then loading over the top of it.
[14:16:58] <Whirl3d> kaoti, I found a couple of other things. i'll fiddle them for you
[14:17:23] <kaolti> thank you, I didnt add all the fade in fade out stuff to keep it simple for now
[14:19:44] <uf0_work> update, forgot one thing
[14:19:44] <uf0_work> http://jsfiddle.net/67A9w/4/
[14:20:14] <kaolti> Whirl3d, by the way Im using hashchange plugin to detect hash change in the url
[14:21:08] <uf0_work> let me be a bit more specific
[14:21:20] <uf0_work> in the link provided everything is working as expected
[14:21:28] <uf0_work> i'm trying to convert what's there
[14:21:31] <uf0_work> to a hover
[14:21:37] <uf0_work> the pagination currently works on click
[14:21:57] <Innocentus_> mbeenen: but I waited until the document finished
[14:21:58] <uf0_work> and it triggers the correct slide
[14:22:10] <uf0_work> what I want instead is to trigger on hover
[14:22:45] <uf0_work> so if I hover over one of the pagination items and it chooses the current slide
[14:22:59] <uf0_work> change .click to .hover isn't working
[14:23:07] <uf0_work> that's where i'm stuck..
[14:23:32] <mbeenen> Innocentus_: hmm, maybe I misunderstood. You're adding the event handler just on an element inline, as part of the onclick attribute, right?
[14:24:10] <kaolti> this is the value of window.location.hash: #/en/hardware-types/routers/
[14:24:16] <Innocentus_> inline
[14:24:20] <mbeenen> Innocentus_: I was saying that, at the point the document is being parsed, and it runs into that element with the onclick attribute, the function you assigned there hasn't been defined, because the javascript won't run until the entire document has been parsed.
[14:24:24] <Innocentus_> onclick="somejqueryplugincall();"
[14:24:27] <kaolti> the original link is the same without the # in the front
[14:24:38] <Innocentus_> I get the error only when I click onto it and triggering the handler
[14:24:41] <Innocentus_> not during loading
[14:25:18] <smplstk> lol Whirl3d
[14:25:28] * smplstk winks at Whirl3d
[14:25:42] <smplstk> caniuse is my bot
[14:30:40] <uf0_work> any ideas?
[14:31:44] <Whirl3d> kaoti, this is my rough rough draft. But it should give you an idea of what I think you want....I need to check for typos, etc.
[14:32:51] <K3|Chris> uf0_work: clowns are scary
[14:33:04] <kaolti> Whirl3d, thanks a lot, do I just check the originial fiddle link?
[14:33:10] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/qXkvG/3/
[14:34:25] <kaolti> thanks! will check it out now
[14:35:34] <uf0_work> K3|Chris: referring to this http://jsfiddle.net/67A9w/4/
[14:35:44] <mbeenen> Innocentus_: Ah, ok. I don't know exactly how the bindings for inline elements, but this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FNXcH/, exhibits the same behavior you're describing. It looks like the function may need to be defined at the time the element is parsed.
[14:36:48] <uf0_work> K3|Chris: the clowns are in the last slide
[14:37:03] <uf0_work> currently works on click trying to make it work on hover
[14:37:42] <Innocentus_> mbeenen: so what to do now? would a plugin work instead?
[14:37:42] <foo> http://jsfiddle.net/zfoo/8uFZX/ - why doesn't the why tab load up extended with this accordion example? hmm
[14:37:54] <Innocentus_> mbeenen: should jquery bind the event to it?
[14:40:22] <mbeenen> Innocentus_: Depends on your situation, but if possible, usually I find it simplest to perform the binding (likely using jQuery) after defining the handler, in the javasciprt.
[14:41:03] <mbeenen> Innocentus_: It's usually a bit more maintainable doing the binding in javascript as opposed to inline in the html, as well.
[14:41:19] <Innocentus_> and then it works?
[14:41:19] <Innocentus_> ok
[14:44:08] <Whirl3d> Kaoti, with comments: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/qXkvG/4/
[14:48:55] <foo> I have an accordion, and I'm trying to programmatically open one of the tabs, but I can't seem to figure it out for the life of me: http://jsfiddle.net/zfoo/8uFZX/ - any suggestions? thanks
[14:52:32] <kaolti> Whirl3d, I had to add the the commented part back which changes the url on click and now im getting the same error
[14:53:16] <Whirl3d> kaoti, the reason you don't want to change the url on click is because that's the function of capturing the hashchange event
[14:53:39] <Whirl3d> you make your links change the hash tag (Just the part behind the #) and then parse the new hash tag to load your content
[14:54:13] <Whirl3d> this allows you to avoid having to reload the page. It captures the Hash change event (hashchange)
[14:54:32] <daxroc> inner link
[14:54:34] <kaolti> exactly thats why I have location.hash = this.pathname;  right?
[14:55:00] <Whirl3d> so you setup a system like: #hardware   for your links would load "/hardware/page.html #index") into your div
[14:55:11] <Whirl3d> but then you don't need the click handler
[14:56:45] <Whirl3d> if your anchor element has the href value of  "#hardware' , then when it's clicked, it will ask for the current page with the new hash added to the url.
[14:57:20] <Whirl3d> so somePage.html#hardware is loaded and you click a link with href="#software" and the new url is somePage.html#software...no page load
[14:57:41] <Whirl3d> if you set the href ="/hardware" then the page is going to load "/hardware" new
[14:58:13] <kaolti> hm I have a different url structure set up though
[14:58:18] <kaolti> can I send you the link to the page?
[14:58:44] <Whirl3d> sure. I'll check it out
[14:58:56] <kaolti> http://baseforall.ca/en/networking/hardware/
[14:59:17] <Whirl3d> All you have to do is figure out a consistent way to change your page hash into your url structure
[15:00:47] <Whirl3d> simplstk, I love caniuse.
[15:01:04] <Whirl3d> lol, smplstk, lol
[15:02:10] <Whirl3d> kaoti, where is the problem?
[15:03:11] <kaolti> sorry, on the page Ive sent you if you click routers or usb drives, they should load the posts from those categories to the right side
[15:03:35] <kaolti> it gives me Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #/en/hardware-types/routers/
[15:04:19] <Whirl3d> where is your load script? what line/file
[15:04:45] <kaolti> ajax.js has all the javascript you've sent me
[15:06:08] <kaolti> http://baseforall.ca/wp-content/themes/twentyeleven/js/ajax.js
[15:06:52] <Whirl3d> oh. Here's what I would do. Rather than put the url to load into the anchor's href attribute, but a unique has identifier like #usb  or maybe #hardware-usb  then in your anchor element, put the actual url in a data-url attribute or something.
[15:08:02] <Whirl3d> kaoti, add a line that says "console.log(url);   at about line 22
[15:08:17] <Whirl3d> then try it and see what the console gives you before the error
[15:09:57] <Whirl3d> or I suppose you could change your markup to add the hash character before the path.....then your hashchange would work.
[15:10:35] <Whirl3d> so your anchor elements would look like href="#/en/hardware/usb " or what have you.
[15:11:25] <Whirl3d> but if you are going to use load and want to load a specific section of a dodcument, you have to make sure you are passing the document's url. That means index.html after a directory if you only suppply the directory in your hash
[15:11:56] <kaolti> hmm give me just a second
[15:12:06] <Whirl3d> np
[15:19:10] <wycks> If I need to clone something using .draggable, should I do that on the start event? or is there a better way?
[15:20:26] <kaolti> Whirl3d, I think I'm missing something. this is how I think the current script should work: When one of those links are clicked the hash is changed which is basically adds # + the href of the link to the current url in the browser.  This will trigger the hashchange function which load the location.hash minus the # in the front + #items, and this is basically the href of the link + #items
[15:23:10] <Whirl3d> except that you have/had the href of the link equal to a completely different url.
[15:23:19] <Whirl3d> your href should only be a hash value
[15:23:30] <Whirl3d> like "#pathtofile"
[15:24:15] <Whirl3d> so since your new content is a completely different path, your url won't actually reflect that. It will show the same path, same url, just a different hash value
[15:24:59] <Whirl3d> when a link is clicked, it makes the url==it's href
[15:25:33] <Whirl3d> behind the scenes if you add just a has value in your href, it adds it to the current url
[15:26:11] <Whirl3d> so "#hello" will actually have the href value of ("http://www.whatever.com/whateverpath/file.html#hello")
[15:26:50] <kaolti> I see so right now the problem is that the href in my links has the full path
[15:27:17] <Whirl3d> if you have an href="/path/file.html" then, behind the scenes, the href value ends up loading ("Http://www.waheterver.com/path/file.html")
[15:27:34] <kaolti> got it
[15:27:43] <Whirl3d> right. You need to find a way to encode your url as a hash...
[15:28:12] <kaolti> you think the full url in the href is causing the javascript and therefore the load not working?
[15:28:36] <Whirl3d> It doesn't fire a hashchange event for a new url
[15:28:53] <Whirl3d> it only fires the hash change event for a new hash.
[15:29:05] <Whirl3d> that's why I got rid of your click handler on your anchor element.
[15:29:50] <Whirl3d> you could put it back and then in the click handler, use: window.location.href=this.attr('href")...but then that's what happens automatically anywys
[15:31:00] <Whirl3d> so, the two ways to get your content would be to assign event handlers for click events on anchor elements. Then manually load the new content and return false (to prevent the browser from loading the new page)
[15:31:26] <Whirl3d> or you could just put the "#" hash in front of your href value and let the hashchange handler handle it.
[15:31:36] <Whirl3d> either way should work fine.
[15:33:11] <kaolti> Oh I got it, I will just add the # to the href of the links
[15:33:55] <Whirl3d> lol, yup
[15:41:04] <foo> Is there anyway to shrink this code? Looks like I don't need to define a function every time, hmm. http://jsfiddle.net/zfoo/Suqsz/
[15:41:47] <kaolti> hehe the load does work now, thanks man!
[15:42:37] <kaolti> can I change the hashtag that is added after the url to anything I want as long as I load the correct page right?
[15:43:15] <Whirl3d> correct.
[15:43:32] <kaolti> awesome, thanks again
[15:43:37] <Whirl3d> I also include a check in the hashchange handler to see if a global variable is set
[15:43:44] <Whirl3d> like MANUALHASH=true;
[15:43:57] <kaolti> why do I need that?
[15:43:58] <Whirl3d> so that I can change the hashtag without firing the hashtag handler
[15:44:15] <kaolti> oh
[15:44:20] <Whirl3d> so, if you are scrollling through contents and you want to update the url (making it bookmarkable or something)
[15:44:42] <kaolti> yea that could be usefull
[15:44:52] <Whirl3d> or if a non-anchor element causes you to load new content and you want a record without using the default hashchange
[15:44:59] <Whirl3d> 8)
[15:45:32] <Whirl3d> But it's important to know that in your document ready script, you need to check for the hash change
[15:45:50] <Whirl3d> That makes it possible to bookmark content.
[15:46:09] <kaolti> yep that works now
[15:46:33] <Whirl3d> in other words, if I load your home page with the hash #subcontent-content  then it needs to load the sub-content-content immediately.
[15:57:59] <foo> anyone see anything wrong with this? doesn't seem to be working?http://pastebin.com/0GcB3i6W

[16:04:04] <melkornemesis> hi guys
[16:04:36] <imsky> Munger: wrap that html in a jQuery object
[16:04:58] <Munger> imsky, Got an example link?
[16:05:01] <imsky> $("<li/>").append($("<p/>").text(row.title));
[16:05:03] <imsky> for example
[16:05:10] <Munger> OIC
[16:05:29] <melkornemesis> is this in jQuery SOMEHOW possible? https://gist.github.com/a923fc4ba9941b46699c
[16:05:48] <imsky> melkornemesis: what are you trying to do?
[16:05:49] <coldhead> nice syntax
[16:05:55] <imsky> coldhead: you shut your fat face
[16:06:02] <imsky> <p />
[16:06:03] <Munger> imsky, Ah. Not quite. I need a variable holding a reference to that object
[16:06:10] <imsky> Munger: which object
[16:06:22] <Munger> The <li>
[16:06:33] <melkornemesis> immortal: somehow pass to the anonymous function this (Search object) as argument
[16:06:36] <imsky> so what's the problem? .append() returns the object
[16:06:41] <coldhead> that was uncalled for imskers
[16:06:48] <imsky> var li  = $("<li />").append("whatever");
[16:06:52] <imsky> coldhead: <3
[16:07:12] <Munger> imsky, Thanks. Still getting used to the syntax
[16:07:21] <imsky> Munger: np, jquery takes a while to figure out
[16:07:34] <imsky> melkornemesis: how about making Search an object instead?
[16:07:46] <imsky> var Search = {search:function(){this.bla = 1}}
[16:08:09] <melkornemesis> imsky: i cant, i am doing this in already existing function :(
[16:08:28] <melkornemesis> just asking, if there is a way
[16:08:34] <uf0_work> hey guys, having some trouble here
[16:08:39] <imsky> ok then set a variable "bla" to this before the .renderSomething definition
[16:08:40] <uf0_work> have a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/67A9w/4/
[16:08:42] <imsky> then in the callback, use bla
[16:08:47] <uf0_work> everything works as expected
[16:08:59] <uf0_work> but i'm now trying to make the trigger on hover
[16:08:59] <melkornemesis> imsky: bla?
[16:09:02] <uf0_work> versus .click
[16:09:13] <Munger> imsky, So $("<li/>").append($("<p/>").text(row.title));   creates the <li> and closing </li> tags?
[16:09:16] <imsky> melkornemesis: any variable name works, just capture the "this" context before you do the callback
[16:09:20] <imsky> Munger: yeah exactly
[16:09:24] <uf0_work> so basically $('.lead_pagination li').click(function() to $('.lead_pagination li').hover(function()
[16:09:28] <Munger> imsky, Weird :-)
[16:09:30] <uf0_work> but that doesn't work for whatever reason
[16:09:43] <imsky> Munger: <li /> implies <li>,/li>, it's a self-closing syntax
[16:10:29] <unseensoul> Hi
[16:11:25] <uf0_work> instead of click event essentially mouse over or hover
[16:11:26] <uf0_work> http://jsfiddle.net/67A9w/4/
[16:12:26] <Krinkle> Munger: When working with the html document from JavaScript one doesn't handle in html strings anymore (so not like a .html document), but we handle with elements
[16:12:48] <Krinkle> Munger: So you can't insert something like '<li>…' and later '</li>'
[16:13:02] <Krinkle> Munger: Instead you create a LI element and insert the element as a whole in the document
[16:13:28] <Munger> Krinkle, I realise that, it's just the jquery syntax I'm trying to get my head around
[16:13:47] <Krinkle> Munger: Yes, because jquery uses "<li>" to create a new element it appears to be a HTML string
[16:13:59] <Krinkle> but in actual fact jquery snips out "li" and calls document.createElement("li")
[16:14:23] <Krinkle> $('<li>').append( $('<p>').text(row.title) );
[16:14:28] <Krinkle> does the same thing
[16:14:46] <iarfen> Hi!!
[16:15:19] <iarfen> How I can do an ajax request that sends the information inside an input type='file' tag?? I need to send the file, not just text or numbers (that is what I know how to send for now)
[16:15:20] <iarfen> ??
[16:16:27] <imsky> iarfen: there are many solutions out there, like jquery form and http://www.webtoolkit.info/ajax-file-upload.html
[16:18:33] <Munger> So this      var li = $("<li/>");   var p = $("<p/>");   $(p).attr( 'md5', row.md5 );    $(li).append( $p );    should work?
[16:19:05] <imsky> yep, except your $p references the wrong variable
[16:21:02] <Munger> I'm trying to store an 'md5' attribute in the <p>
[16:21:34] <imsky> ok
[16:21:41] <Munger> That item receives a click event and I need to retrieve a value
[16:22:14] <imsky> $("p").click(function(){alert($(this).attr("md5"))})
[16:23:42] <Munger> Yeah. I already get the events and handle them. I'm just trying to break down the syntax in my head
[16:24:44] <Hopsy> coldhead: save this in your bookmark http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=U8NNHmV3QPw
[16:27:29] <Munger> imsky, Actually, I've been using livequery -- $('#content li p') .livequery('click', function( event ) { ..... }
[16:27:44] <imsky> what's this livequery
[16:28:04] <Munger> http://brandonaaron.net/code/livequery/docs
[16:28:26] <imsky> last updated 2 years ago
[16:28:27] <imsky> yeaah
[16:28:32] <imsky> ?on
[16:28:33] <bot-t1> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:28:36] <imsky> this is what we use now
[16:28:46] <wycks> anyone familiar with using .draggable with .clone maybe have a min to look at this, http://jsfiddle.net/rGUma/1/, I can't figure out the way to stop cloning the draggable if it's inside the .drop-zone box
[16:29:04] <tw2113> ack! wycks found me
[16:29:15] * tw2113 scampers into hiding
[16:29:27] <wycks> aha, ill stop stalking you if you know the answer
[16:29:38] <tw2113> that takes brains
[16:29:42] <tw2113> and i'm a scarecrow
[16:29:53] <coldhead> oh thanks Hopsy
[16:30:09] <Hopsy> yw coldhead
[16:33:06] <blah> so i'm having trouble with pageX and PageY with ie9
[16:33:07] <bot-t1> (725 hours ago) <RedFox2> tell blah sss
[16:35:41] <AngryAngel> I'm having an issue with "Jquery Slideshow" (Coin Slider) http://workshop.rs/2010/04/coin-slider-image-slider-with-unique-effects/    It works while on the main page, however it doesn't seem to function as it should once I am on a different page (not the main page).
[16:37:13] <AngryAngel> Any help would be appreciated as I am too stupid to realize what to do.
[16:37:43] <eddiemonge> are the subpages different somehow/
[16:37:55] <AngryAngel> Could I pm you with links?
[16:38:12] <AngryAngel> It would make a lot more sense then
[16:38:31] <eddiemonge> you cant just paste them here?
[16:38:35] <AngryAngel> I can
[16:38:41] <AngryAngel> http://moonlightmedia.tv/
[16:38:44] <blah> if i resize a browser window, should the pageX and pageY properties change behaviors?
[16:38:52] <blah> as it does in ie9. but not in Chrome.
[16:38:52] <AngryAngel> Click anywhere and you'll see what I mean
[16:41:01] <AngryAngel> eddiemonge, did you have a look?
[16:41:38] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: did you look at the console errors?
[16:41:59] <AngryAngel> There aren't any as far as I'm aware.
[16:42:22] <AngryAngel> My knowledge of jquery/css is very basic. I've been working with it for around a week.
[16:42:35] <AngryAngel> I've worked on that website for 3-4 days...
[16:42:47] <eddiemonge> there are a ton of console errors
[16:42:59] <AngryAngel> I bet lol
[16:43:09] <Che-Anarc> I have the following URL: http://json.mmotraffic.com/url/?affiliate_=6351&creative_=1843860   in my script how can I get what the url returns to a simple string? ... just cant seem to get my head round how $.getJSON  should be used.
[16:43:21] <eddiemonge> mostly due to the fact the coin-slider plugin you are using is using an old version of jquery loaded from a relative path to a place that doesnt exist
[16:43:45] <AngryAngel> If that was the case
[16:43:49] <AngryAngel> It wouldn't work at all :p
[16:43:52] <eddiemonge> Che-Anarc: thats not valid json
[16:44:09] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: yes it would. because its relative to the root of your site, which the index page is
[16:44:16] <eddiemonge> ?ftj @ AngryAngel
[16:44:17] <AngryAngel> I could use a newer version but it's not necessary for that particular thing
[16:44:17] <bot-t1> AngryAngel, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[16:44:40] <Che-Anarc> eddiemonge   oh?  -  what is it then? and what should be doing?
[16:44:55] <AngryAngel> eddiemonge, so my solution is to simply change the jquery version?
[16:45:24] <Che-Anarc> eddiemonge  I just need what that url returns to a string to be able to know what assets to load
[16:45:37] <eddiemonge> Che-Anarc: that page has a ('link') which i dont know what it is supposed to be
[16:46:00] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: no. not even close. you need to learn the difference between relative and absolute url paths
[16:46:20] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: and then find a wordpress plugin that actually looks to see if jquery is enqueud or not already
[16:46:37] <AngryAngel> You are behaving exactly as an annoying teacher would
[16:46:46] <eddiemonge> Che-Anarc: so is it supposed to be a text string or json like the url implies?
[16:46:50] <AngryAngel> You want me to do things which I should, but they are not necessary
[16:46:58] <Che-Anarc> eddiemonge   a url
[16:47:01] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: they are necessary
[16:47:16] <daxroc> Gota love irc eh
[16:47:19] <eddiemonge> Che-Anarc: in string or json format?
[16:47:50] <Che-Anarc> eddiemonge   I'm not quiet sure to be honest... I'm using a webservice that is very poorly commented.
[16:48:12] <smplstk> Che-Anarc: example URL?
[16:48:43] <AngryAngel> eddiemonge, if you don't know the solution you could just say so.
[16:48:45] <Che-Anarc> URL: http://json.mmotraffic.com/url/?affiliate_=6351&creative_=1843860   = what it returns is what I need
[16:48:55] <eddiemonge> Che-Anarc: and poorly written from the looks of it
[16:49:05] <disappearedng> Hey how do I say '/rooms/123/'.match('/rooms/' + /^\d{1,}$/) ?
[16:49:21] <daxroc> Che-Anarc: it's not json, but you should be able to parse the url out
[16:49:27] <eddiemonge> Che-Anarc: you need to have it be parsed as a string and then manipulate it to pull out just the url
[16:49:31] <smplstk> ya - def not json
[16:49:42] <Che-Anarc> Can someone exemplify?
[16:49:50] <smplstk> Che-Anarc: sec
[16:50:03] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: i do know the solution. you need to learn what a relative url path is and then you will see how your site is broken
[16:50:16] <daxroc> Che-Anarc: use $.get and parse the response
[16:50:37] <smplstk> haha eddiemonge
[16:50:50] <AngryAngel> Yes that is hilarious
[16:50:53] <AngryAngel> Let's all laugh at him
[16:50:54] <AngryAngel> HAHAHA
[16:50:58] <smplstk> rule #1, relative vs absolute paths
[16:51:20] <smplstk> Angry Angel is Angry.
[16:51:53] <AngryAngel> Are you a comedian? You must be.
[16:52:30] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: open chrome. open your site in chrome. open then console. look at the errors. then see ? lmgtfy relative url path
[16:52:31] <bot-t1> AngryAngel, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=
[16:52:40] <blah> so, position() for ie9 doesn't really find the position of the element
[16:52:43] <imsky> oh bot-t
[16:52:45] <eddiemonge> ?lmgtfy relative url path @ AngryAngel
[16:52:46] <bot-t1> AngryAngel, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=relative+url+path

[16:53:27] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: if you want me to actually fix your errors for you, i charge an hourly fee. paid up front
[16:53:32] * imsky gets the popcorn
[16:53:41] <imsky> AngryAngel: i'll do a better job with less attitude
[16:53:54] <eddiemonge> if you want my help to help you solve your own problems, then listen to what im saying instead of arguing with me
[16:54:26] <snover> imsky: you? less attitude? :)
[16:54:29] <Che-Anarc> smplstk  am getting an example?
[16:54:30] <eddiemonge> imsky you are a riot. i think i need a shield from you lol
[16:54:35] <imsky> eddiemonge: <3
[16:54:38] <imsky> snover: </3
[16:54:47] <snover> imsky: whatever baby you know you love it
[16:54:49] <blah> someElement.position() returns 8 in ie9, and in chrome it returns 600
[16:54:54] <smplstk> Che-Anarc: I don't think there's anything you can do with this on the front-end
[16:54:56] <blah> what is up with that?
[16:54:57] <AngryAngel> * Added imsky!*@* to ignore list
[16:55:00] <smplstk> since it's not actual json
[16:55:03] <AngryAngel> * Added smplstk!*@* to ignore list
[16:55:07] <AngryAngel> More comedians - please go ahead.
[16:55:08] <smplstk> there's no way to handle it :(
[16:55:08] <imsky> oh wow
[16:55:13] <AngryAngel> eddiemonge, I'm reading http://www.ibdhost.com/help/path/
[16:55:16] <imsky> yeah screw that guy lol
[16:55:38] <smplstk> wait, which guy?
[16:55:42] <blah> so is position() bugged in ie9?
[16:55:45] <eddiemonge> Che-Anarc: $.get('whateveryoururlis', function(data) { v d=data.replace("('), '').replace("')", ''); }, "text")
[16:55:48] <imsky> the dude who just put you on ignore smplstk
[16:55:53] <smplstk> one "lol" and people start blocking you :(
[16:56:04] <imsky> i know right
[16:56:07] <imsky> i know his type too
[16:56:11] <imsky> butt status: clenched
[16:56:14] <smplstk> How to drive the interweb: 101
[16:56:25] <AngryAngel> eddiemonge,
[16:56:27] <eddiemonge> always good to ignore the chan ops
[16:56:36] <smplstk> ah well.
[16:56:36] <imsky> snover's an op
[16:56:36] <AngryAngel> I had the "url path" issue before
[16:56:42] <eddiemonge> blah: shouldnt be. might just be your implementation of the code. got a demo?
[16:56:43] <imsky> snover loves all humanity
[16:56:44] <AngryAngel> And the site wasn't functioning as it should
[16:56:51] <snover> UR AN OP
[16:56:56] <imsky> PLZ OP ME
[16:56:57] <AngryAngel> But when I changed the path, then the "Coin Slider" started working.
[16:57:00] <daxroc> smplstk: oh gaawd no, we're all gona die
[16:57:03] <imsky> CUZ I DONT FEEL OP
[16:57:04] <snover> A MOVC OP
[16:57:08] <imsky> a wat
[16:57:08] <snover> BOOM
[16:57:10] <AngryAngel> So when you said that "url path" is the issue, I don't think that it is.
[16:57:12] <blah> Math.round((bar.parents(".outerContainer").position().left)) will print two different values
[16:57:20] <blah> depending on which browser i am using. ie9 and chrome some newer version
[16:57:23] <imsky> Math.round of an integer? lmao?
[16:57:32] <imsky> oh wait it might be a float if you're bad at animation
[16:57:40] <Che-Anarc> smplstk   how do you mean?... all I know is that what this url returns varies.. I just want to be able to call it and get what it returns so as to be able to use that link.
[16:57:59] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: ok go ahead and visit http://moonlightmedia.tv/2012/03/16/testing-31/wp-content/themes/traction/javascripts/coin-slider.js and then tell me why it doesnt work
[16:58:06] <daxroc> blah: solution = stop using ie9  :D
[16:58:06] <smplstk> I know, but it's not actual JSONP
[16:58:08] <smplstk> so
[16:58:18] <blah> daxroc..
[16:58:20] <smplstk> same orgin policy prevents you from parsing the data on the front end
[16:58:22] <blah> that's not a solution
[16:58:27] <smplstk> origin :/
[16:58:43] <Che-Anarc> eddiemonge  I think that line is not correct.
[16:58:46] <blah> and yes imsky, the bar is animatible/draggable
[16:58:54] <eddiemonge> Che-Anarc: its not valid json so unless the string is the same format all the time its going to be hard
[16:58:54] <smplstk> ?sop @ Che-Anarc
[16:58:55] <bot-t1> Che-Anarc, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[16:59:04] <imsky> blah: roger sir
[16:59:21] <blah> maybe i'll try to cook something up in jsfiddle demonstrating
[16:59:28] <blah> but if it is actually an inconsistency, what's the solution?
[16:59:34] <AngryAngel> Ah-ha
[16:59:37] <blah> besides "don't use ie9"
[16:59:40] <AngryAngel> 2012/03/16/testing-31/wp-content/themes/traction/javascripts/coin-slider.js
[16:59:50] <AngryAngel> It's because I have "2012/03/16/testing-31" in the beginning.
[16:59:54] <AngryAngel> That's why it's behaving that way.
[16:59:57] <AngryAngel> Isn't it..?
[16:59:58] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: ... relative vs absolute paths ...
[17:00:00] <smplstk> lolwat
[17:00:01] <Shai-Tan> I have a dropdown menu, with an onchange. When a value is selected, a form is generated and place asynchronisly below the dropdown. One of the fields on the dropdown is a jquery ui datepicker, but it does not work. Do I need to do something with the reponse to make this work?
[17:00:11] <AngryAngel> So if I was to write ../wp-content/themes/traction/javascripts/coin-slider.js
[17:00:17] <AngryAngel> Would it work?
[17:00:25] <eddiemonge> ?tias @ AngryAngel
[17:00:26] <bot-t1> AngryAngel, Try It And See
[17:00:35] <AngryAngel> Alright
[17:00:48] <eddiemonge> Shai-Tan: you have to call the UI after you load the content
[17:00:59] <smplstk> "* Added smplstk!*@* to ignore list"
[17:01:05] <smplstk> >:|
[17:01:08] <imsky> smplstk: lol
[17:01:16] <imsky> i don't care that he ignores people
[17:01:23] <imsky> but that he publicizes it
[17:01:31] * smplstk sets mode +k +b
[17:01:36] <Shai-Tan> eddiemonge: how would I do that, as the form is generated after the page is loaded?
[17:01:36] <smplstk> ALL THE THINGS
[17:01:40] <imsky> laoaaol
[17:01:56] <smplstk> *rageface*
[17:02:03] <AngryAngel> It does work.
[17:02:06] <imsky> k-line that bredren
[17:02:09] <AngryAngel> So you see, I didn't actually need what you said
[17:02:15] <AngryAngel> To learn the difference between the two
[17:02:21] <smplstk> ...
[17:02:23] <AngryAngel> I just needed to know what's causing it
[17:02:32] <AngryAngel> And by seeing the full URL I was able to determine what the issue was
[17:02:52] <AngryAngel> Anyway, thank you.

[17:03:21] <eddiemonge> Shai-Tan: however you are bringing the content in, in that callback call .datepicker() or whatever method you are using
[17:03:47] <foo> Can someone look over these lines. See anything wrong with 'em ? http://pastebin.com/deLG1iHb - hmm, not working and not too sure
[17:04:16] <Shai-Tan> eddiemonge: I see, so in my .change function in this case
[17:04:18] <eddiemonge> foo: you need to wrap the click functions in function() { your code }
[17:04:23] <blah> bah. I can't even create a simple test case in ie9 jsfiddle is erroring.
[17:04:28] <blah> while it is not erroring in chrome
[17:04:29] <blah> http://jsfiddle.net/XXzcH/2/
[17:04:44] <eddiemonge> Shai-Tan: if you .change is doing an ajax call then you need to do it in the ajax callback, or use a deferred
[17:04:45] <foo> eddiemonge: ah, even if the function is already defined?
[17:04:51] <creati29> how do i create html elements that have multiple nested children with jquery such as div -> h1 'hello, p 'hi /div
[17:04:54] <imsky> smplstk: maybe that's why he's angry
[17:04:58] <blah> SCRIPT5: Access is denied.   select.js, line 134 character 7 SCRIPT5: Access is denied.   select.js, line 134 character 7 SCRIPT5: Access is denied.   select.js, line 134 character 7
[17:05:03] <imsky> he keeps ignoring people on irc and ends up friendless

[17:05:39] <eddiemonge> foo: its not defined. you cant do .click( somefunction(withArgs) ). it has be .click( someFunction ) or .click( function() { somefunction(withArgs) })
[17:05:43] <blah> SOP?
[17:05:50] <smplstk> ?tell AngryAngel smplstk still loves you
[17:05:50] <bot-t1> smplstk, Okay.
[17:05:53] <foo> eddiemonge: aha, ok, thank you
[17:05:57] <creati29> or is the best method just to place the html in a variable and append it when needed?

[17:06:05] <imsky> oh god wat
[17:06:14] <Shai-Tan> eddiemonge: thanks for you help/time
[17:06:21] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: still there?
[17:06:26] <blah> wow this is really annoying.  so how the heck am i supposed to put  up a test case demonstrating this bug
[17:06:30] <AngryAngel> Sure
[17:06:31] <bot-t1> (2 mins 21 secs ago) <imsky> tell AngryAngel i'll poop in your bed
[17:06:31] <bot-t1> (41 secs ago) <smplstk> tell AngryAngel smplstk still loves you
[17:06:38] <smplstk> haha
[17:06:44] <imsky> hahaha jackpot
[17:06:48] <eddiemonge> couldnt resist
[17:06:52] <imsky> thanks eddiemonge
[17:06:53] <smplstk> wait he blocked us both?
[17:06:56] <imsky> yes
[17:07:01] <AngryAngel> Yes both of you
[17:07:07] <blah> [17:01] <@smplstk> "* Added smplstk!*@* to ignore list"
[17:07:09] <AngryAngel> But blocked is not the word that you should use
[17:07:11] <imsky> aw you bleedin heart
[17:07:15] <imsky> you unignored us
[17:07:21] <imsky> or maybe never ignored us in the first place
[17:07:24] <imsky> you just wanted attention
[17:07:27] <AngryAngel> eddiemonge, any other amazing jokes?
[17:07:32] <AngryAngel> Or unnecessary things I should research?
[17:07:33] <imsky> well that bed is still getting pooped in
[17:07:43] <AngryAngel> When someone asks about religion
[17:07:46] <smplstk> sharing is caring, we're all trying to help.
[17:07:47] <AngryAngel> Tell them to read bible
[17:07:49] <eddiemonge> blah: i know its not different, but try this http://jsfiddle.net/XXzcH/4/
[17:07:50] <AngryAngel> They'll get their answer!
[17:08:10] <smplstk> cool story, bro
[17:08:16] <AngryAngel> It's not a story.
[17:08:19] <AngryAngel> It's a suggestion.
[17:08:24] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: yes unnecessary to learn the basics so that you can troubleshoot it by yourself
[17:08:32] <imsky> eddiemonge: wait what's this guy's deal?
[17:08:38] <imsky> i was too busy threatening soiled beds
[17:09:09] <AngryAngel> Well telling someone to read 1000 unnecessary lines is slightly stupid.
[17:09:17] <AngryAngel> A better way would be to tell them what their error is.
[17:09:25] <smplstk> learning is stupid, mmhmm
[17:09:40] <AngryAngel> I'm not trying to learn, I'm trying to make it work.
[17:09:45] <imsky> yea i get all my jquery knowledge from fox news
[17:09:47] <blah> anyone know what HTML1115: X-UA-Compatible META tag ('IE=EmulateIE7') ignored because document mode is already finalized.  4 HTML1115: X-UA-Compatible META tag ('IE=EmulateIE7') ignored because document mode is already finalized.  4 HTML1115: X-UA-Compatible META tag ('IE=EmulateIE7') ignored because document mode is already finalized.  4 means?
[17:09:53] <AngryAngel> :)
[17:10:19] <smplstk> I know you're trying to make it work, but trust me, you'll remember this the next time you encounter a similar mistake
[17:10:26] <smplstk> whereas if somebody just blurted out the fix
[17:10:27] <smplstk> you'd forget
[17:10:31] <AngryAngel> Not really
[17:10:44] <AngryAngel> I didn't try and learn, I just tried to fix the mistake.
[17:10:46] <eddiemonge> if i didnt know the basics, i couldnt have figured out your problem in the 2 seconds
[17:10:53] <AngryAngel> And when I saw the full link, I knew what it was.
[17:11:03] <AngryAngel> I will remember it anyway, because it was important to me.
[17:11:04] <eddiemonge> i pretty much knew what your issue was when you described it
[17:11:08] <smplstk> so then we're all cool bros again
[17:11:09] <AngryAngel> I tried to fix it a few times, I was unable to.
[17:11:11] <smplstk> hooray internet!
[17:11:16] <AngryAngel> Exactly that.
[17:11:17] <daxroc> AngryAngel: I hope you enjoy making many more
[17:11:17] <imsky> internet for the wins
[17:11:28] <eddiemonge> but its because i know the difference between what an absolute path and a relative one is and how each is written in a site
[17:11:47] <AngryAngel> But I didn't
[17:11:50] <eddiemonge> because i read some articles and tutorials and guides and learned
[17:11:54] <AngryAngel> And I determined the problem within 5 seconds
[17:11:57] <eddiemonge> not just had someone fix it for me
[17:12:01] <imsky> oh lord
[17:12:02] <AngryAngel> So eventually I would've understood :p
[17:12:09] <imsky> banish thee to thine code editor already
[17:12:16] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: really, you said you had been working on it for awhile and couldnt figure it out
[17:12:21] <foo> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/LTNx7RJR - ok, I think I did this right. For some reason, though, it doesn't scroll properly. hmm.
[17:12:23] <AngryAngel> That's right
[17:12:26] <AngryAngel> That's why I said "eventually"
[17:12:28] <AngryAngel> :-)
[17:13:15] <blah> ok it looks like this is the actual test case i'm looking at: http://jsfiddle.net/XXzcH/7/
[17:13:26] <blah> ie9 and chrome inconsistencies. maybe i'm using position where i shouldn't
[17:13:37] <AngryAngel> My point is that you could've said because "the path in front is the problem" or something along those lines
[17:13:43] <AngryAngel> I would've learned and fixed my mistake that way
[17:13:52] <imsky> let's talk about the fixed problem some more
[17:13:56] <AngryAngel> But by telling someone to do research on such a small error is a bit silly
[17:14:00] <AngryAngel> Yeah I'll stop now
[17:14:03] <AngryAngel> Thanks again eddiemonge
[17:14:20] <smplstk> AngryAngel: absolute vs relative is like how to make the webs
[17:14:37] <eddiemonge> foo: http://jsbin.com/eyipip/edit#javascript  what is it that you are clicking on and what is it you think you are scrolling to?
[17:14:45] <smplstk> sorry for not fixing faster and making it easier for you?
[17:14:51] <AngryAngel> I forgive you.
[17:15:19] <smplstk> that's ok, I forgive you too
[17:15:26] <blah> why does IE9 log -0.25 and chrome logs 62 in the test case?
[17:15:33] <AngryAngel> Didn't ask for forgivness :p
[17:15:36] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: i wasnt telling you do research on a small error. i was telling you to learn the basics of web development. and by me saying relative path, if you knew what it was you would have understand the error immediately after that instead of causing everyone in this room anguish
[17:16:07] * b0x OH THE ANGUISH!! \o/
[17:16:09] <eddiemonge> i aplogoize room for all the drama.
[17:16:09] <blah> wahh, focus on the real problem of position() not working
[17:16:13] <blah> you're causing me anguish
[17:16:17] <imsky> holy christ
[17:16:20] <imsky> take it to pm pl0x
[17:16:20] <eddiemonge> please lets get back to solving actual problems
[17:16:41] <blah> my problem is probably harder/more interesting anyways
[17:16:49] <AngryAngel> Definitely.
[17:16:56] <smplstk> my problem is aids.
[17:17:02] <smplstk> who can fix that for me?
[17:17:08] <AngryAngel> A gun.
[17:17:13] <blah> a monkey with aids.
[17:17:36] <blah> Tragic Johnson's money
[17:19:37] <blah> hrm. position relative doesn't seem to be the culprit
[17:19:45] <smplstk> what happens in IE9?
[17:19:53] <BillyJoe> For some <img> elements, I do .fadeOut('slow', callback), and in the callback I set the .load to a callback that calls .fadeIn(), and then I set the src attribute to a new image. This works perfectly in firefox, but in IE9 all images end up with "display: none;". What can be the cause?
[17:20:30] <AngryAngel> Whenever the page is loading, the images pile up/stick out. How can I prevent that/hide them while it loads?
[17:20:38] <AngryAngel> http://moonlightmedia.tv/
[17:20:51] <AngryAngel> Some, probably most of you won't even notice that, because you have decent Internet.
[17:20:54] <blah> smplstk, it prints -0.25 in ie9
[17:20:59] <blah> in chrome it prints 62
[17:21:16] <blah> when i take out the margin attributes, ie9 console gets a SCRIPT5: Access is denied.   select.js, line 134 character 7 SCRIPT5: Access is denied.   select.js, line 134 character 7 SCRIPT5: Access is denied.   select.js, line 134 character 7
[17:21:30] <blah> but somehow i think this is unrelated to my problem
[17:21:35] <smplstk> AngryAngel: typically you would hide them, display: none, and show them once the page has loaded
[17:21:44] <eddiemonge> ?fouc @ AngryAngel
[17:21:45] <bot-t1> AngryAngel, Avoiding the FOUC v3.0  Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/
[17:21:59] <blah> oh well i'll just not use position() then.. it's broken
[17:22:02] <AngryAngel> I'll have a look
[17:22:03] <AngryAngel> Ty
[17:23:02] <smplstk> AngryAngel: that artcile is more related to fonts, but the same concept applies.
[17:23:38] <eddiemonge> you typically dont want to use display: none unless you dont care about people that have js disabled
[17:23:45] <eddiemonge> which most dont seem to
[17:23:50] <smplstk> ya
[17:23:53] <smplstk> this is true.
[17:24:03] <AngryAngel> Well I don't care about them.
[17:24:03] <smplstk> I guess I don't care, trolololo
[17:24:03] <imsky> yeah i don't care about those people
[17:24:12] <AngryAngel> Since only a few people do that.
[17:24:27] <imsky> oh you don't have js enabled? have fun living in 1994
[17:24:44] <eddiemonge> i should ammend that to include people who dont care about getting sued
[17:24:51] <smplstk> to be fair, those _were_ some shaddy times.
[17:24:55] <eddiemonge> for accessibility issues
[17:25:06] <blah> does position() need explicit coordinate information of the parent?
[17:25:16] <daxroc> Who has js disabled now ? what percentage of users. and are they your target anyway
[17:25:18] <blah> i know the demo only sets margins/padding
[17:25:19] <AngryAngel> So since I am such an imbecile
[17:25:23] <AngryAngel> Could someone tell me exactly what to do
[17:25:29] <AngryAngel> To fix this small issue
[17:25:31] <smplstk> eddiemonge: you can build accessible JS sites
[17:25:37] <blah> daxroc, people with phones have javascript disabled
[17:25:42] <smplstk> so like, blind people can't sue you...
[17:25:44] <blah> it's called iphone and android apps.
[17:25:47] <blah> duh.
[17:25:50] <blah> welcome to 2008
[17:26:07] <smplstk> um, iphone and android have JS enabled.
[17:26:19] <blah> a cocoa app doesn't touch javascript
[17:26:30] <blah> i'm not talking about the in phone embeded browsers either
[17:26:42] <blah> anyways, any more insite on position()?
[17:26:54] <daxroc> blah: why, and there prob not your intended audience tho. I wouldn't care for users that disable it, detect they dont have it enabled and make fun of them !
[17:27:29] <AngryAngel> smplstk?
[17:27:34] <blah> winderp is a different story but yea.
[17:27:40] <blah> ok time to hack a different way of getting parent position
[17:27:44] <blah> bye
[17:28:00] <AngryAngel> I'll say bye to make you help me later
[17:28:03] <AngryAngel> Bye blah!
[17:33:58] <blah> o wow it's already a known issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8836777/jquery-position-not-working-in-ie9
[17:34:00] <blah> position is useless
[17:34:34] <blah> i can't stop finding bugs in jquery/jquery ui waahhhhh
[17:35:50] <imsky> cause you're a terrible person
[17:35:51] <blah> time to refactor all position code to use offset now..
[17:36:10] <AngryAngel> Whenever the page is loading, the images pile up/stick out. How can I prevent that/hide them while it loads?
[17:36:24] <AngryAngel> (How can I use "display:none" function) in http://moonlightmedia.tv/
[17:36:43] <blah> it's because open source is unstable in general ... which is why they still want to charge you 100 million dollars an hour to fix their broken code. but its' free. boo hoo. now i know where to monkey patch. laters.
[17:38:03] <foo> I have this: $('.navigation1 > .practice').click(function() { ... } - but, inside that class, I have a href="#something" - does the fact that a href="#something" cancel out the fact that it was clicked on? or no?
[17:38:08] <AngryAngel> :l
[17:38:51] <TylerWhitney> foo: no
[17:39:02] <foo> TylerWhitney: thanks, something else must be broke here, then
[17:39:46] <TylerWhitney> if you continue to have trouble feel free to pastebin or jsfiddle and I should be around to take a look
[17:42:22] <foo> TylerWhitney: http://pastebin.com/GBMEw3QD - I tried to optimize the code, but my version (on top) doesn't work (but the version on bottom does) - am I missing something simple here? hmmm
[17:42:26] <foo> TylerWhitney: thank you!
[17:44:23] <AngryAngel> TylerWhitney, can you help me as well?
[17:49:21] <foo> TylerWhitney: eg. they should both do the same thing, but they don't
[17:51:34] <infid> if you attach a click event to a div, and the div gets resized, will the click even still work?
[17:53:11] <TylerWhitney> inifid: yes it should
[17:53:15] <TylerWhitney> foo: looking now
[17:55:34] <foo> TylerWhitney: Thanks! brb
[17:56:01] <coldhead> sorry for your loss TylerWhitney
[17:56:13] <coldhead> whitney houston was a unique talent
[17:56:15] <coldhead> :(
[17:56:26] <eddiemonge> coldhead: where were you earlier?
[17:56:44] <coldhead> taking a wizz?
[17:56:55] <TylerWhitney> foo: why are you using "this" in your scrollit function and
[17:57:02] <TylerWhitney> "html, body" in the below version
[17:57:59] <eddiemonge> foo: can paste latest code plez?
[17:58:28] <TylerWhitney> eddiemonge: he pasted here http://pastebin.com/GBMEw3QD
[17:59:20] <TylerWhitney> foo: I don't think its much more optimized above than below... but you're trying to scroll, the "this" would return the element you've got not html,body
[17:59:45] <AngryAngel> eddiemonge, that link didn't really help.
[18:01:18] <TylerWhitney> AngryAngel: why don't you CSS display: none and then use .ready to display them?
[18:01:50] <AngryAngel> I wouldn't know where to insert them.
[18:02:06] <TylerWhitney> I don't quite understand the problem looking at this link: http://moonlightmedia.tv/
[18:02:09] <TylerWhitney> what is wrong?
[18:02:19] <AngryAngel> Well you have a decent Internet
[18:02:23] <AngryAngel> So you CANNOT see the problem
[18:02:25] <TylerWhitney> lol
[18:02:33] <AngryAngel> The problem is that those images stick out/pile on top of each other
[18:02:36] <AngryAngel> While the page is loading
[18:02:57] <AngryAngel> I'll show you an image, 1 moment.
[18:03:02] <TylerWhitney> Whatever images are stacking up either put style='display:none;' on them or do it on their class/id in your CSS file
[18:03:25] <TylerWhitney> THEN in $(document).ready() do a .show() on that id/class
[18:03:44] <TylerWhitney> brb
[18:04:31] <AngryAngel> http://i.imgur.com/xhN3h.png
[18:04:41] <AngryAngel> After 2-3 seconds it's fine (it's what you see)
[18:05:56] <AngryAngel> TylerWhitney, alright
[18:05:57] <jahrichie> I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction.  I'm using a jquery ui slider code (http://pastebin.com/0NDtJuXe)-- I need to format the dreamA amount with commas.  I've tried some jquery number formatting stuff and js examples also and nothing is working right.  any recomendations are welcome
[18:06:03] <AngryAngel> I'll do that, hopefully without messing up too much :-)
[18:06:21] <jahrichie> I apologize i messed up that link http://pastebin.com/0NDtJuXe
[18:07:23] <RandalSchwartz> ajpiano?
[18:07:55] <ajpiano> what's up RandalSchwartz ?
[18:08:03] <RandalSchwartz> "the check is in the mail" :)
[18:09:23] <eddiemonge> jahrichie: have you looked at a page like http://www.queness.com/post/9806/5-missing-javascript-number-format-functions
[18:09:36] <AngryAngel> TylerWhitney, this is the "document ready" code
[18:09:38] <AngryAngel> http://pastebin.com/1aLJRsDP
[18:10:05] <AngryAngel> The name of my ID is "coin-slider"
[18:11:50] <jahrichie> eddiemonge: i've seen the second solution, I must be doing something wrong
[18:12:06] <jahrichie> the amount is being calculated on the fly bu the slider, is that perhaps why?
[18:13:51] <eddiemonge> jahrichie: probably.
[18:15:10] <eddiemonge> when oh when will people stop using pastebin?
[18:16:39] <jahrichie> haha
[18:16:43] <jahrichie> jsfiddle?
[18:16:53] <jahrichie> what should i be using
[18:16:59] <jahrichie> i'm very new to this, apologies
[18:17:47] <eddiemonge> jahrichie: without knowing anything else http://jsfiddle.net/qhnVc/
[18:19:02] <jahrichie> eddiemonge: i tried that
[18:19:11] <jahrichie> no go
[18:19:24] <jahrichie> i had  it sowewhat figured out the other night
[18:19:29] <jahrichie> it was little buggy
[18:19:33] <jahrichie> i should go back and try to clean that up
[18:19:36] <AngryAngel> How can I use ".show()" with DIV ID?
[18:20:21] <jahrichie> #id
[18:20:21] <AngryAngel> $('.DIVHERE') .show()     ?
[18:20:29] <jahrichie> not .divhere
[18:20:31] <jahrichie> #divhere
[18:20:35] <eddiemonge> jahrichie: if you turn that jsfiddle into a demo of your code it might help
[18:20:35] <jahrichie> savy ?
[18:20:48] <AngryAngel> Class/ID whatever

[18:26:57] <AngryAngel> Thank you TylerWhitney
[18:30:09] <astkfour> how do you detect an element with a space in the class name this wont work if ($("img.Suspicious Mushrooms").length > 0) {alert("Found Suspicious Mushrooms!");}
[18:33:28] <letterpress> astkfour classes can't have spaces in their name. those are two different classes, .Suspicious and .Mushrooms.

[18:35:14] <AngryAngel> Visually they both look exactly the same.
[18:36:52] <AngryAngel> I'll stop asking questions when I fix this problem
[18:37:07] <AngryAngel> I already asked for plenty of help :p
[18:37:40] <astkfour> ok so the person who made the site doesnt know coding edict lol
[18:37:55] <astkfour> can ID have spaces?
[18:38:41] <AngryAngel> No
[18:38:50] <AngryAngel> And even I'm certain that the answer is no
[18:38:53] <AngryAngel> And I know shit
[18:39:33] <AngryAngel> It would be wonderful if someone could come up with a solution
[18:40:28] <johnkpaul-afk> AngryAngel: can you ask your question again?

[18:41:55] <letterpress> angryangel maybe if you rephrased we'd understand what you're asking. what sliding images?

[18:42:47] <AngryAngel> If you click on that, you will not.
[18:42:54] <letterpress> oh do you know about the javascript console angryangel?
[18:43:02] <letterpress> there are 10 errors shown in the second page
[18:43:02] <eddiemonge> jahrichie: you have to include a jQuery UI theme file in the resources section
[18:43:03] <AngryAngel> I know nothing. Sorry.
[18:43:23] <eddiemonge> letterpress: i tried to teach that but AngryAngel just wants the fix, not the reasoning or knowledge behind the fix
[18:43:25] <AngryAngel> Those errors are probably from unnecessary divs
[18:43:43] <AngryAngel> eddiemonge, I already fixed that issue haven't I
[18:43:58] <AngryAngel> As an example, before it used to be:
[18:44:03] <letterpress> might i recommend this? http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[18:44:04] <AngryAngel>     <script type="text/javascript" src="wp-content/themes/traction/javascripts/coin-slider.js"></script>
[18:44:10] <AngryAngel> Then I changed it to this and it worked:
[18:44:12] <jahrichie> eddiemonge: as you see if you paste the comma codes above that function it doesnt work  :-(
[18:44:12] <johnkpaul> AngryAngel: it's because jquery is loaded in one
[18:44:14] <johnkpaul> but not the other
[18:44:14] <AngryAngel>     <script type="text/javascript" src="../wp-content/themes/traction/javascripts/coin-slider.js"></script>
[18:44:57] <AngryAngel> johnkpaul, that's what I think as well, but isn't my "path" fixed?
[18:45:03] <AngryAngel> I mean is it still a problem?
[18:45:09] <eddiemonge> AngryAngel: seriously, open chrome, open the console inspector and actually LOOK at the errors
[18:45:21] <AngryAngel> I only have FF & IE
[18:45:35] <AngryAngel> & firebug
[18:45:45] <jahrichie> AngryAngel: upgradey our firefox and use the inspector
[18:46:15] <johnkpaul> haha
[18:46:28] <johnkpaul> yes, AngryAngel, listen to them, begin to learn how to debug
[18:46:36] <johnkpaul> but it is still a problem, you are using relative, not absolute paths
[18:46:48] <AngryAngel> Okay
[18:47:11] <AngryAngel> Pretty sure it's a very simple solution
[18:47:17] <AngryAngel> But all of you want the beginners to spend their time
[18:47:32] <AngryAngel> Looking for one thing and learning 1000000000000 unnecessary while doing so
[18:48:05] <letterpress> i said 10 javascript errors ;)
[18:48:16] <tw2113> sounds like a deal to me
[18:48:20] <tw2113> oh, we're not bartering?
[18:48:39] <letterpress> actually they're not all javascript errors
[18:49:14] <AngryAngel> Helpful
[18:49:24] <eddiemonge> for the 1000000000000000000 time ...absolute paths vs relative paths ...
[18:49:25] <letterpress> all you need to do is read about the javascript console, use it, and i think the path will be much clearer for ya.
[18:49:28] <AngryAngel> Just not on my forehead
[18:49:29] <letterpress> yup
[18:50:33] <johnkpaul> AngryAngel: complaining about free help isn't going to get you anywhere, here, to skip the google step for you
[18:50:33] <johnkpaul> http://webdesign.about.com/od/beginningtutorials/a/aa040502a.htm
[18:50:55] <johnkpaul> you shouldn't need to learn that many unneccessary things, just read that, and you'll get what you need
[18:51:13] <AngryAngel> I was actually reading that since 3 mins ago
[18:51:17] <AngryAngel> +/-
[18:54:34] <eddiemonge> jahrichie: http://jsfiddle.net/8Ec3d/12/
[18:55:05] <jahrichie> eddiemonge: you are the man
[18:55:23] <jahrichie> ytmnd
[19:02:23] <AngryAngel> Figured it out..
[19:02:31] <AngryAngel> And exactly like I said - a very simple solution
[19:02:37] <AngryAngel> And those "lessons" were not helpful
[19:02:40] <AngryAngel> They just mess with your head
[19:05:15] <pr0ton> can anybody suggest a nice photo uploader for jQuery?
[19:05:43] <jahrichie> pr0ton: what are you uploading the images for?
[19:05:46] <jahrichie> and doing with
[19:05:50] <jcp_> is it possible to lazy load images in a for loop? http://jsfiddle.net/dy9hQ/
[19:06:15] <pr0ton> jahrichie, i need to display them. and then send them onto the server to be stored statically somewhere
[19:06:48] <jahrichie> i'd use php for htat
[19:07:00] <jahrichie> or a bacend
[19:07:02] <pr0ton> ...
[19:07:09] <pr0ton> i wasnt asking for the backend part
[19:07:11] <pr0ton> i know how to do that
[19:07:15] <jahrichie> ohhh
[19:07:17] <jahrichie> ok
[19:07:18] <pr0ton> i wanted to know if there is some nice jquery frontend
[19:07:25] <jahrichie> TONS
[19:07:31] <pr0ton> anyway for backend the most optimal thing to use is amazon s3 ;)
[19:07:52] <jahrichie> http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/
[19:08:03] <jahrichie> that's a server
[19:08:09] <pr0ton> just checking it out
[19:08:10] <pr0ton> looks nice
[19:08:10] <jahrichie> not a programming language
[19:08:13] <jahrichie> or
[19:08:25] <jahrichie> jquery drag and drop uploaders is what i'd go for
[19:08:35] <jahrichie> depending on what browser support you need
[19:08:43] <pr0ton> ah ok
[19:08:46] <jahrichie> glick!
[19:08:49] <jahrichie> gluck!
[19:08:53] <pr0ton> so what it does is, do ajax uploading
[19:08:56] <pr0ton> and then references that url
[19:10:03] <jcp_> when i try to lazy load a bunch of images within a for loop, just works for the last image http://jsfiddle.net/dy9hQ/
[19:10:05] <pr0ton> woohoo, so it seems like imgur has a javascript api that allows cross domain requests
[19:10:06] <pr0ton> http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/03/the-shortest-image-uploader-ever/
[19:11:41] <astkfour> so if an id has space in it whats the best way to detect it ?
[19:12:12] <astkfour> i also tried this with no luck if ($("img[id='Suspicious Mushrooms']").length > 0) {}
[19:14:53] <letterpress> astkfour well id's shouldn't have spaces. this is madness.
[19:16:49] <coldhead> letterpress++
[19:16:59] <johnkpaul> astkfour: http://jsfiddle.net/bdF2g/
[19:17:05] <johnkpaul> that's how you figure it out
[19:17:11] <johnkpaul> but it is madness
[19:22:27] <scr3am> astkfour: if( $(...).match(/ /) ) ???
[19:22:59] <astkfour> lol i just want to alert if found
[19:23:47] <astkfour> its for an online game i'm making an extension to alert me when a picture shows
[19:25:01] <scr3am> so if an id has space in it whats the best way to detect it ?  if( $(<ID>).match(/ /) ) { alert('i alert you'); }
[19:26:36] <astkfour> is match some type of regex?
[19:26:46] <scr3am> yeah...
[19:27:12] <scr3am> match(/ /) <--- search for space
[19:29:51] <eddiemonge> 3.2.3.1 The id attribute
[19:29:51] <eddiemonge> The id attribute specifies its element's unique identifier (ID). The value must be unique amongst all the IDs in the element's home subtree and must contain at least one character. The value must not contain any space characters.
[19:30:01] <eddiemonge> http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/elements.html#concept-id
[19:30:13] <eddiemonge> astkfour: there you go. ID's must not contain any space characters
[19:30:16] <eddiemonge> ever
[19:30:33] <eddiemonge> so if yours do, you must fix them post haste
[19:30:34] <scr3am> accidentally?
[19:31:02] <johnkpaul> astkfour: I gave you a solution
[19:31:04] <johnkpaul> no?
[19:32:25] <eddiemonge> dont give solutions for things that should not exist. thats not good
[19:32:37] <astkfour> just to clearify this is not my website its for an extension
[19:32:43] <johnkpaul> :) I was hoping at the time that he was trying to root them out
[19:32:45] <astkfour> i see john thank you look at it now
[19:32:59] <johnkpaul> and needed this in order to not manually search his code for them
[19:34:57] <scr3am> johnkpaul: solution looks great... question i always use .attr(), you used .prop()... i thought .prop() would be for things like checkbox ( checked ) , you know what i mean?
[19:36:10] <astkfour> johm that looks for all divs right? i only need these http://pastebin.com/LekuxfDc
[19:36:26] <ragnok> hello, i'm learning javascript and jquery. i noticed that ajax calls are mostly done with php in tutorials over the net. how would i do jquery/ajax calls to a node.js server?
[19:36:41] <johnkpaul> scr3am: I know the difference, but to be honest, I don't know when to use one over the other in this case
[19:36:47] <johnkpaul> prop is for proeprties of the dom element
[19:36:56] <johnkpaul> attribute is for attributes of the dom element in the html
[19:36:58] <johnkpaul> id is both
[19:37:09] <scr3am> ahhh, good man...
[19:37:22] <johnkpaul> ?prop @scr3am
[19:37:23] <bot-t1> scr3am, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[19:37:27] <johnkpaul> I just read that
[19:37:48] <johnkpaul> astkfour: yes, the code I gave you was for divs
[19:38:33] <johnkpaul> it should be trivial to change it to work for the tags you are looking for
[19:38:34] <scr3am> yeah, i know, so if i continue using attr i am safe...
[19:39:07] <scr3am> cool... i just noticed it in your code...
[19:40:13] <scr3am> johnkpaul: do you have 2 minutes looking on some code i've written a few days ago?  just curious if it's totally crap or something useful
[19:40:27] <johnkpaul> sure
[19:40:33] <johnkpaul> and then I'm going to bed :)
[19:43:17] <scr3am> yeah...
[19:43:33] <scr3am> so it's basically for the functionality you see there
[19:44:00] <infid> how do you check if $(".foo") exists?
[19:44:28] <infid> if ($(".foo") != []) ?
[19:44:37] <ngharo> check .length
[19:44:48] <infid> thanks
[19:47:25] <zzz> Is there a best practice for getting a simple popup box to follow the cursor?
[19:48:07] <astkfour> thanks johnkpaul i just have one more concern this finds all img tags what would i do to narrow it down to a specific id
[19:48:34] <ert3> hey guys anyone know of a plugin that has both grid and tabular view for data
[19:48:56] <ert3> see I'm running data out of a DB and right now i have it coming out tabular for the sake of using data tables
[19:49:06] <ert3> however another part of the interface needs to be a bit more graphical
[19:49:21] <ert3> so i wanted to have little buttons in a grid for similar data
[19:50:11] <ert3> I know I can just change the way the data is output but I'm looking for those cool prebuilt Jquery features seen in data tables like live searching
[19:50:19] <ert3> mostly asking as time is a factor for me
[19:54:16] <zzz> Anybody?  Displaying a simple textbox that follows the mouse cursor?
[20:02:58] <ngharo> ?mousemove @ zzz
[20:02:58] <bot-t1> zzz, .mousemove(handler): Bind an event handler to the "mousemove" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/
[20:03:57] <quizme> if i'm iterating over  an array, how do I get the 0th to the (i-1)th elements?
[20:04:35] <quizme> Array.slice ...
[20:09:08] <tylerwillingham> Would anyone mind taking a look at the following code? https://gist.github.com/097c93fb529bca687531 I have a project that I need to wrap up and another developer that knows javascript far better than I do wrote this and the images aren't actually changing. Apparently my brain went to sleep because I need some help to point me in the right direction to get this up and functioning
[20:18:34] <ert3> tylerwillingham: you have better luck with the jackals in javascript
[20:18:43] <ert3> at least they respond
[20:18:47] <tylerwillingham> hahaha
[20:18:50] <ert3> everyone here is probably asleep
[20:19:00] <ert3> or lurking
[20:19:05] <ngharo> that code looks awfully familiar
[20:19:13] <ngharo> tylerwillingham: you'd be better asking an actual question
[20:19:25] <ert3> OH DEAR GOD
[20:19:30] <ert3> don't do that man you scared me
[20:19:54] <tylerwillingham> awfully familiar?
[20:20:32] <ert3> work with enough programers your bound to see some one else's style of programing
[20:20:47] <ngharo> i swear i wrote that last night for someone
[20:21:18] <tylerwillingham> nah i think we were all drinking last night
[20:23:03] <ngharo> quite possible
[21:03:54] <abjorn> jayqweriez
[21:06:52] <ert3> jayqweriez
[21:07:37] <abjorn> yes, sir
[21:07:38] <abjorn> that is correct
[21:07:41] <systemfault> As long as it's not gayQueery... :/
[21:07:57] <abjorn> for some reason i could believe that being a thing
[21:08:34] <abjorn> gayqueery is a channel populated exclusively by coldhead
[21:10:36] <coldhead> your claim demeans homosexuals
[21:11:22] <abjorn> you make a good point
[21:11:55] <abjorn> man, you really can't do that to other ajax/dom libs
[21:12:00] <abjorn> gaytype...protogay?
[21:12:03] <abjorn> do...gay?
[21:12:05] <abjorn> gayjo?
[21:17:06] <ngharo> jayquarry
[21:17:11] <frewsxcv> if i have <a> <meow>hello</meow> <b> <meow>hola</meow> </b></a>, and i do $("a"), how do i get only the direct child of the selected element?
[21:17:15] <abjorn> jaboscrapts
[21:17:28] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/KXNDb/ JAYQUARRY
[21:17:40] <abjorn> ?children
[21:17:40] <bot-t1> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[21:17:57] <abjorn> or $("a > *")
[21:18:01] <abjorn> though that's slow
[21:18:27] <abjorn> just like coldhead
[21:18:51] <systemfault> :/
[21:18:54] <frewsxcv> thanks abjorn
[21:18:58] <systemfault> What has coldhead done? :(
[21:19:03] <abjorn> guess that's all he needed..
[21:19:04] <abjorn> lol
[21:19:11] <abjorn> what hasn't coldhead done?
[21:19:21] <coldhead> anything of note
[21:19:22] <abjorn> this is just how we initiate noobies, it's coldhead's first day
[21:19:28] <ngharo> coldhead raped and murdered a child in 1988
[21:19:33] <abjorn> woah
[21:19:46] <coldhead> it's cool, i was a child then myself
[21:19:52] <systemfault> Pff....
[21:20:04] <systemfault> Priest did that before he did.
[21:20:06] <abjorn> Is it sad that that actually makes it seem better to me?
[21:20:10] <Guest29257> i have just been looking for the newest step by step instructions for jquery and code school is my only real find , i can find much older websites but aside from jquery.com where do you go for junior level instruction on jquery?
[21:20:57] <abjorn> http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html
[21:20:59] <abjorn> ^ there
[21:21:32] <Guest29257> thank you
[21:21:34] <abjorn> np
[21:22:18] <Guest29257> does asking question in IRC ever help or do only like to deal with people that know what they are doing?
[21:22:51] <abjorn> nah ask whatever you want
[21:23:05] <abjorn> all skill levels brah
[21:24:17] <Guest29257> is this room fairly populated on the regular or does it go dead for long periods of time, are there certain times that people come , i am not a regular IRC person but i would like to talk to people that are familar with jquery?
[21:24:21] <abjorn> it's weird that I come back to work on an old C++ project after not using C++ for months and it's only gotten easier since the last I used it
[21:24:28] <abjorn> well
[21:24:37] <abjorn> there's usually 600-800 people in here at any given time
[21:24:44] <Guest29257> word
[21:24:45] <caniuse> Guest29257: bond
[21:25:03] <abjorn> chances are there's someone in here who can help you when you need it
[21:25:05] <Guest29257> how do i change my name from guest to something more eloquent?
[21:25:09] <Guest29257> it wouldnt give me my nicholas handle
[21:25:13] <abjorn>  /nick omgimsoawesome
[21:26:45] <Guest29257> i am at the point where i can install jquery and interact with jquery plugins but i cant write my own plug in
[21:26:47] <abjorn> If you find a name you like you might want to register it so no one  else can use it
[21:26:55] <abjorn>  /msg nickserv register omgimsoawesome omg@omg.com
[21:27:08] <abjorn> werd
[21:28:16] <Guest29257> anyways
[21:30:36] <anthonyrose> can i ask someone to look at something
[21:30:48] <abjorn> that's such a meta question
[21:30:49] <abjorn> go ahead
[21:30:49] <coldhead> anthonyrose: did you look at http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[21:30:54] <anthonyrose> http://www.writealot.us/melissa
[21:31:02] <anthonyrose> its my first decent jquery website
[21:31:23] <anthonyrose> that uses the template i have wanted to be smart enough to use for like two yeas
[21:31:24] <anthonyrose> years
[21:31:28] <abjorn> nice
[21:31:47] <anthonyrose> i modded the old navigation to the new navigation
[21:31:57] <anthonyrose> and it was a feat of personal brilliance for me
[21:32:05] <anthonyrose> but the background image is too large
[21:32:10] <abjorn> that it is
[21:32:15] <anthonyrose> but i love the ide
[21:32:17] <anthonyrose> idea
[21:32:24] <anthonyrose> i was hoping to get some feedback on how to improve the site
[21:32:39] <anthonyrose> what would you suggest to get an ambient background
[21:32:45] <anthonyrose> that i can lay text over
[21:32:47] <anthonyrose> just color?
[21:32:49] <anthonyrose> css gradient?
[21:33:06] <abjorn> You might be interested in this, anthonyrose: http://joelb.me/scrollpath
[21:33:41] <anthonyrose> i have seen that , does it use a solid background that is unmoving?
[21:33:45] <anthonyrose> a fixed background?
[21:34:43] <abjorn> afaik
[21:35:09] <anthonyrose> abjorn: can you work with larger amounts of information with it, i mean it looks like you can only do so much wit that set up and if you use too much information it will look strange
[21:35:30] <anthonyrose> <abjorn> it looks like only sparse information works with that
[21:35:34] <abjorn> I wouldn't think so. As long as it doesn't take up more than a page
[21:35:46] <abjorn> each point on the path, that is
[21:35:46] <anthonyrose> ill play with it
[21:35:55] <abjorn> I'm not necessarily suggesting it
[21:35:57] <abjorn> for your site
[21:36:03] <abjorn> your site just reminded me of that
[21:36:06] <anthonyrose> i have seen it
[21:36:10] <anthonyrose> i love jquery motion
[21:36:13] <anthonyrose> i love it
[21:36:20] <anthonyrose> i love a site that has smooth motion on it
[21:36:26] <anthonyrose> horizontal sites are my favorite
[21:36:34] <anthonyrose> because they seem so elegant to me
[21:36:44] <anthonyrose> with the jquery smooth motion
[21:45:32] <Whirl3d> spam much?
[21:46:54] <abjorn> no u
[21:46:58] <Whirl3d> lol
[21:47:01] <Whirl3d> sometimes
[21:47:09] <coldhead> GUYS HALP WHAT IS THIS ERROR MEANS Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'appendTp'
[21:47:57] <abjorn> for a second I didn't see that it was you, coldhead, and I took that seriously
[21:48:16] <abjorn> i was about to be very dissapoint son
[21:48:16] <Whirl3d> coldhead, is this your first day using jquery?
[21:49:16] <coldhead> someone in ##php fix for me
[21:49:35] <coldhead> jQuery.fn.appendTp = jQuery.fn.appendTo;
[21:54:49] <abjorn> man, if jquery started being lenient with spelling mistakes like that I think I'd give up on life
[21:55:05] <coldhead> method_missing() <3
[21:55:31] <coldhead> and the jQuery mascot can popup and say "Did you mean, appendTo?"
[21:55:41] <abjorn> dearjesus
[21:56:02] <coldhead> "It looks like you're writing a plugin. Would you like to use one of Ben Almond's?"
[21:56:04] <abjorn> what kind of future are you imagining for us you villain
[21:56:13] <abjorn> >almonds
[21:59:22] <coldhead> it could happen
[21:59:38] <coldhead> i think there's a method_missing analog in a proposed ecmascript
[21:59:50] <coldhead> which should be in browsers A MILLION YEARS FROM NOW
[22:47:17] <pr0ton> from a file input field, how do i get the file object?
[22:48:07] <Eviltwin> In JavaScript?
[22:52:28] <nights``> hi

[22:52:58] <Eviltwin> nights``: Sounds like a question for #css
[22:53:10] <nights``> hmm
[22:53:12] <nights``> really?
[22:53:39] <coldhead> those guys love CSS
[22:53:41] <nights``> i try to ask there
[22:53:45] <coldhead> they're mad for it
[22:53:45] <nights``> sure they do
[22:53:49] <coldhead> weirdos
[22:54:40] <Escherial> hey, anyone have a recommendation for an easy-to-use library for dragging and dropping elements in a vertical list?
[22:55:00] <Escherial> preferably using a dedicated handle for each one, and allowing for easy addition/subtraction from the list
[22:57:48] <Eviltwin> Escherial: Have you looked at jQuery draggable/sortable?
[22:58:14] <sgo11> hi, I am a newbie. can anyone suggest a good tutorial for jquery? The official document I found is really hard to follow. they don't explain anything. All the basic stuff like variables, arguments, syntax etc.. They are basically not for beginners, even if the doc says it's for beginner... thanks a lot.
[22:58:45] <coldhead> sgo11: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[22:59:12] <sgo11> coldhead, thanks a lot. :)
[22:59:18] <coldhead> have fun sgo11
[22:59:30] <sgo11> coldhead, cheers. ^_^
[23:09:31] <coldhead> a womannn
[23:09:42] <coldhead> down therrrre
[23:17:21] <LukeNukem> coldhead, down where
[23:17:23] <sgo11> Can anyone suggest an open source jquery cms project which is written by jquery only? no php etc... thanks.
[23:18:03] <LukeNukem> sgo11, it wouldn't be a cms if it had no server side language
[23:18:06] <LukeNukem> unless it used node.js
[23:18:35] <LukeNukem> maybe js can work with mongodb and it has been written that way
[23:18:55] <Escherial> Eviltwin: a bit; i found it daunting a year ago when i took a look at it
[23:18:59] <Escherial> i'll check it out again, though
[23:19:05] <LukeNukem> sgo11, ooh i found this, might interest you http://code.google.com/p/editease/
[23:19:11] <LukeNukem> editEase - no fuss, no database, no worries
[23:19:52] <sgo11> LukeNukem, ok. I just want to create a simple home page which have some links and texts with a good looking UI. just wondering if there are any existing ones that I can use. I think jquery should be enough for this purpose. I really won't use php. thanks a lot.
[23:21:56] <LukeNukem> sgo11, well you could do that yourself without a cms :)
[23:22:34] <LukeNukem> sgo11, check this out http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
[23:25:58] <sgo11> LukeNukem, I knew bootstrap. it does not support IE6. with php, I will choose wordpress, but I kinda don't like php at all. I am a newbie on javascript div things. in jquery tutorial, I don't find any good doc regarding creating a good layout UI homepage. thanks. :)
[23:27:16] <LukeNukem> sgo11, you're wasting your time with wordpress, its annoying and to make  sexy something out of it you will most probably prefer plugins with obsolete support
[23:27:35] <LukeNukem> when you encounter an issue, you go to their channel- they sent you to another channel from where you get sent back to the wp channel
[23:28:08] <LukeNukem> if you are going to use a software, i would suggest phpbb3 or this http://www.tomatocms.com/ << you can style this with a visual editor or somethin
[23:28:55] <coldhead> i would just open a weebly account, spend 5 minutes on it and open a nice imported beer
[23:29:00] <coldhead> and then let the good times roll
[23:29:13] <LukeNukem> ew weebly
[23:29:13] <LukeNukem> :\
[23:29:24] <coldhead> drag and drop, bitches
[23:29:35] <LukeNukem> wordpress is quite good actually, i just prefer to code mine on my own :3 or use something i can put more time into
[23:29:47] <LukeNukem> coldhead, i used to use that when i was 11, good times
[23:30:05] <coldhead> i thought you were 11 now
[23:30:16] <sgo11> LukeNukem, OK. I will not touch php at all. so wordpress is not my choice. :) I think I will study jquery from scratch and make my own then if there is no existing framework that uses only jquery (no php). thanks.
[23:30:16] <coldhead> do you mean you used it earlier today?
[23:30:34] <LukeNukem> ^yep :)
[23:30:44] <LukeNukem> would you like to see?
[23:30:57] <coldhead> sgo11: jQuery is for the browser, it doesn't have anyway to store or publish blogposts
[23:31:07] <coldhead> that's what PHP etc do
[23:31:20] <coldhead> you can't replace them with jQuery
[23:31:23] <coldhead> they do different jobs
[23:31:36] <sgo11> coldhead, I just want a homepage. that's all. and some texts and links to .html files.
[23:31:47] <coldhead> sgo11: you don't need a CMS at all then
[23:31:52] <coldhead> you just need a text editor
[23:32:04] <coldhead> LukeNukem: i would like to see
[23:32:12] <coldhead> we're talking about your site, right
[23:32:20] <LukeNukem> yup yup
[23:32:28] <coldhead> you're not threatening to blind me
[23:32:29] <coldhead> oh good
[23:33:03] <LukeNukem> http://i.imgur.com/Gu7Gm.png
[23:33:32] <coldhead> you're in .au LukeNukem
[23:33:37] <sgo11> coldhead, right. but I am new on this. just want to use an existing one if there are any. if no, I will have to study jquery from scratch. most of tutorials are about animation etc.. they don't talk about making a good homepage layout. thanks.
[23:33:40] * coldhead takes notes
[23:33:58] <coldhead> sgo11: they're different skills
[23:34:03] <coldhead> i know how to makes a website work
[23:34:07] <coldhead> but i can't make it look good
[23:34:10] <LukeNukem> ^same here
[23:34:16] <coldhead> i usually have to get either a woman or a gay man design it for me
[23:34:40] <LukeNukem> sgo11, you use those tutorials and combine everything together to make it attractive
[23:34:46] <coldhead> sgo11: you might like to ask in #html5 for some design resources
[23:34:48] <LukeNukem> either way, jquery is mainly dom editing n stuff
[23:34:55] <LukeNukem> or #css
[23:35:01] <coldhead> #css are freaks
[23:35:02] <LukeNukem> coldhead, what do you mean in au
[23:35:14] <coldhead> you have a tab about perth
[23:35:21] <coldhead> i assumed perth, western australia
[23:35:28] <sgo11> yeah, they are different skills. that's why I was asking about cms. :) I would like to support IE6, so html5 is not an option. maybe, I just grep a php cms...
[23:35:30] <LukeNukem> eh?
[23:35:31] <LukeNukem> perth?
[23:35:33] <LukeNukem> dafuq?
[23:35:45] <LukeNukem> sgo11, there is a way to make html5 work on IE6
[23:35:59] <coldhead> Web Design Perth, it says, in the tab, in the screenshot
[23:36:01] <coldhead> well never mind then
[23:36:02] <sgo11> LukeNukem, really? how? never heard of it.
[23:36:05] <coldhead> let's get on with our lives
[23:36:08] <LukeNukem> coldhead, oh that :)
[23:36:12] <LukeNukem> thats some site i had open yesterday
[23:36:27] <LukeNukem> sgo11, yeah but if you are building it entirely in js think about this, what if the user has js disabled?
[23:36:30] <coldhead> let us never speak of this again
[23:37:02] <LukeNukem> then you're website is completely useless, but you can set a <noscript> tags for fallback
[23:37:03] <LukeNukem> :D
[23:37:17] <coldhead> your*
[23:37:25] <sgo11> LukeNukem, I will never consider a user who disables js. If they disable js, then I don't support them. :D
[23:37:37] <coldhead> that's the right attitude, sgo11
[23:37:53] <coldhead> i have no pity for people who disable JS
[23:38:02] <coldhead> they are used to everythig being broken anyway
[23:38:05] <coldhead> they expect it
[23:38:19] <TravisD> Does jquery have a cross-browser solution for binding to mousescroll events? $(element).scroll(…) does not seem to have the same effect as element.addEventListener("mousescroll", …) in chrome
[23:38:20] <LukeNukem> sgo11, thats what i do for IE using bastards
[23:38:31] <LukeNukem> they have an internet, they have a pc, yet they dont have an html5 browser
[23:38:34] <LukeNukem> so i ditch them
[23:38:58] <coldhead> TravisD: that's probably not the best supported event in jQuery's arsenal
[23:39:07] <coldhead> there are a few plugins that might make it better
[23:39:11] <coldhead> did you look at any of them?
[23:39:30] <TravisD> coldhead: Thanks.  I haven't looked at any plugins yet, but maybe I will check them out
[23:39:37] <sgo11> LukeNukem, well, users may not know what html5 is. users may not even know how to copy and paste their files in explorer. so, I have to support IE6. back to original question, you said there was a way to support html5 in IE. what is it? thanks.
[23:39:51] <TravisD> coldhead: I'm trying to capture scroll events on a canvas. Do you know of a better way to do that?
[23:40:28] <LukeNukem> sgo11, http://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/make-html5-elements-work-in-old-ie/
[23:40:36] <Cork> TravisD: why don't you just use on('mousescroll') ?
[23:41:12] <LukeNukem> Cork, hey man, i finished that thing..would you like to see a screenshot
[23:41:28] <imakewebthings> Cork: if he's referring to the mousewheel event, jQuery doesn't normalize the mousewheel event (its got a different event name in Gecko)
[23:41:37] <sgo11> LukeNukem, got it. thanks a lot. :)
[23:41:40] <Cork> LukeNukem: sorry but i don't remember what "that thing" is :), butsure
[23:41:43] <TravisD> Cork: I don't think that works in all browsers
[23:41:50] <imakewebthings> ergo, jquery.mousewheel
[23:41:52] <coldhead> whence the plugins
[23:41:58] <coldhead> lol
[23:41:59] <LukeNukem> Cork, the keyup thingie with a timer :D
[23:42:00] <coldhead> latin <3
[23:42:06] <Cork> ah
[23:42:19] <coldhead> GOOD TIMES
[23:42:28] <TravisD> Ah ,thanks :) I've never used a jquery plugin but I guess there is a first for each
[23:42:34] <TravisD> er, a first for everything.
[23:43:29] <LukeNukem> Cork, http://i.imgur.com/Y34Am.png
[23:44:08] * Cork nods
[23:44:38] <LukeNukem> so whaddaya think
[23:44:56] <coldhead> i think skrillex is an abomination
[23:45:28] <LukeNukem> what does abomination mean
[23:45:39] <coldhead> ?define abomination
[23:45:41] <bot-t1> coldhead, abomination - (noun) The feeling of extreme disgust and hatred; abhorrence; detestation; loathing; as, he holds tobacco in abomination.
[23:46:02] <coldhead> what about the adjectival sense, bot-t1
[23:46:02] <bot-t1> coldhead, Better not tell you now.
[23:46:04] <coldhead> WHAT ABOUT IT
[23:46:44] <aro> what is an auto executable function?
[23:47:01] <Cork> aro: (function() {})();
[23:47:11] <aro> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9765768/rapid-ajax-requests-with-jquery-results-in-a-syntaxerror
[23:47:15] <aro> im trying that, but it doesnt work
[23:48:25] <aro> i dont know where to put the 'autoexecutable' function
[23:49:08] <aro> (this isnt my post, just pertinent to what i have going on)
[23:50:35] <aro> what do i do?
[23:51:02] <coldhead> aro: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[23:51:22] <coldhead> that's the nitty gritty on what that guy thinks will solve the problem
[23:51:37] <coldhead> read that and see if the solution makes sense
[23:52:01] <coldhead> even if it doesn't, you can just start wrapping things in IIFEs and see what happens
[23:52:08] <coldhead> maybe something good! maybe something bad :(
[23:54:12] <aro> okay cool , tahnks!
[23:54:49] <aro> why does he call himself cowboy
[23:54:52] <aro> thats not very original
