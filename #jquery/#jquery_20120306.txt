[00:03:12] <initself> I need help figuring out how this .bind actually gets executed:
[00:03:13] <initself> http://code.google.com/p/tablesorter/issues/detail?id=2#c4
[00:03:22] <initself> Do I need to .trigger it?
[00:03:49] <initself> $("table").tablesorter().trigger.......
[00:03:54] <initself> is that what the dude means?
[00:13:04] <D4> How do I target a <li><span this>text</span><form..><form.. value="108"></li> <-- the span where it's form > input with name="something" has value="something else"?
[00:14:32] <D4> It's <li class="item"><span>text</span><form ...><input type="hidden" name="someName" value="someVal" /></form></li> <-- I need to grab the span where the value is someVal
[00:14:44] <jita> any idea why this does not work without the $.getScript("/static/js/filter.js"); line ?
[00:15:07] <jita> http://jsfiddle.net/D6A6H/
[00:15:24] <initself> got it

[00:20:06] <__composern> hi
[00:20:55] <__composern> is there any function grabbing first row  for jquery datatables plugin
[00:23:03] <__composern> any type help appreciated
[00:27:39] <d1rkp1tt> Hi all, I am trying to get jquery UI slider working and following the guide here: http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started
[00:28:08] <d1rkp1tt> At the moment, it seems to have rounded the corners on my text box... but not much is happening
[00:28:22] <d1rkp1tt> Are there detailed instructions to follow anywhere ?
[00:29:27] <initself> __composern: isn't that just gonna be grabbing the first row in a table?
[00:30:40] <__composern> initself: yes but when user search somethink the first row going to change
[00:31:05] <initself> right, it is pretty complicated....
[00:31:18] <__composern> table content and first row changes dynamically
[00:35:57] <d1rkp1tt> Well I have the slider showing now.. just need to get the value into my form
[00:37:29] <poppiez> imagine firing $.getScript('http://example.com/stuff.js'); right after each other. is it possible to make sure it only fetches once while firing each callback individually?
[00:37:41] <poppiez> (native in jQuery - I could, of course, create the logic myself)
[00:39:05] <Cork> poppiez: two ways
[00:39:25] <Cork> make the script set a variable you set
[00:39:47] <Cork> or set a variable when you get the callback event to getScript
[00:40:09] <Cork> s/variable you set/variable/
[00:41:04] <poppiez> Cork: if I set the variable after the callback event I'd risk fetching stuff.js twice, right?
[00:42:40] <Cork> poppiez: if you fire them that rappidly, yes
[00:42:52] <poppiez> Cork: I mean, _right_ after each other :P
[00:42:54] <Cork> so set a variable before you do $.getScript
[00:43:05] <Cork> and check if that variable is set
[00:44:56] <poppiez> Cork: yeah but I still need each callback to fire when the script has been fetched
[00:46:01] <poppiez> Cork: this is my code right now: http://pastie.org/private/5sz825c8anpe58v43mj0wa
[00:46:21] <poppiez> imagine firing loadMaps right after each other (e.g. two scripts that depend on maps)
[00:46:45] <poppiez> pastie screwed the formatting a bit - I hope it's ok
[00:47:01] <ga> hai'
[00:48:11] <Cork> poppiez: like i said; you set a varaible and set if beore you make the call
[00:48:28] <Cork> *set it
[00:49:18] <Cork> poppiez: if you want to make it a little bit safer you can add an error callback that resets the variable
[00:49:31] <Cork> (or retries, if you prefer that)
[00:49:34] <poppiez> Cork: you mean a boolean that checks if loadMaps has been fired before? I don't see that fixing the problem. that would mean the second script that fires loadMaps will fire the callback right away even though the script hasn't loaded yet
[00:49:43] <gnagno> hello all
[00:50:37] <gnagno> can someone help me with this fiddle please? http://jsfiddle.net/gnagno/VD8N8/
[00:50:42] <d1rkp1tt> found more documentation...
[00:50:56] <d1rkp1tt> all good now, much appreciated :p
[00:53:57] <Cork> ?ask @ gnagno
[00:53:58] <bot-t> gnagno, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:54:44] <gnagno> Cork, I think it was a direct question :)
[00:54:51] <AdvoWork> Hi there, got a really small section of code: http://pastebin.com/QJeST64U  basically i call $post and get some information from a file, this works fine, but within that im setting a variable, i alert it, and then after the post I basically alert again. The second alert after the post fires before the post, any ideas why? as it alerts blank
[00:55:38] <Cork> gnagno: "can someone help me with this fiddle please" falls into asking if someone wants to help
[00:55:47] <Cork> just ask what you need help with
[00:56:15] <gnagno> Cork, I think in english this is the polite form for asking for help :)
[00:56:27] <gnagno> I can't say "help me with this ...."
[00:56:35] <Cork> gnagno: in english, yes, on irc it just waists ppls time
[00:56:44] <Cork> and that makes ppl cranky
[00:57:19] <Cork> gnagno: read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:57:36] <gnagno> Cork, ok help me with my fiddle now: http://jsfiddle.net/gnagno/VD8N8/ ( you told me to ask in this form :P )
[00:57:44] <Cork> ...
[00:57:54] * Cork smells a troll...
[00:59:05] <Strfns> I think there's just a communication breakdown here
[00:59:23] <LukeNukem> can someone tell me if this is valid code >> http://pastebin.com/h4kBEvH1
[00:59:24] <Strfns> gnagno, what exactly is your question is what Cork is asking, I think.
[00:59:34] <LukeNukem> i do if statement inside .html
[00:59:35] <LukeNukem> ide says its wrong but
[00:59:42] <LukeNukem> someone here gave me the code so yeah
[01:00:13] <gnagno> Strfns, my first message was: "can someone help me with this fiddle please? http://jsfiddle.net/gnagno/VD8N8/ " I think it's clear enough :)
[01:01:18] <iLearn> Hello good people
[01:01:31] <aro> hello
[01:04:24] <AdvoWork> anyone know how to use datatables and inline editing, BUT client side only, don't need any updates?
[01:04:33] <iLearn> I have this criteria, i have <span id="latitude"></span>...am hoping to use this #latitude
[01:04:48] <iLearn> to change the value...like btw the spans
[01:05:53] <LukeNukem> iLearn, what?
[01:06:10] <LukeNukem> you want to change the value of that span element iLearn ?
[01:06:47] <Strfns> gnagno, you had to use #out instead of .out and also wrap element in $()
[01:07:11] <iLearn> LukeNukem: yes
[01:07:31] <Strfns> gnagno, http://jsfiddle.net/aejur/
[01:07:39] <LukeNukem> iLearn, ok $("#latitude").html("stuff in here");
[01:07:44] <iLearn> LukeNukem:  so that it reads: <span id="latitude">[supplied value]</span>
[01:07:49] <gnagno> Strfns, thank you it's working now :)
[01:07:56] <iLearn> LukeNukem: is there a better way of achieving this kind of stuff?
[01:08:01] <gnagno> I was accessing it with class instead of with id :)
[01:08:07] <LukeNukem> iLearn, not that i know of, .val is for input fields i believe
[01:09:07] <LukeNukem> iLearn, you could put the span in a parent element called maindiv and then do something like $("#maindiv").html("<span id='latitude'>Value here</span>");
[01:09:56] <LukeNukem> iLearn, its client side so i wouldn't worry about speed or anything xD
[01:10:27] <iLearn> LukeNukem: okay.
[01:10:50] <LukeNukem> its fun, you'll see :D
[01:14:35] <Xotix> i have a form with an hidden element. If you click on the submit button, i'd like to change the value of the hidden element, how do i do that? http://pastebin.com/dZyyEUZw

[01:15:41] <Cork> <input type="submit"> ?
[01:15:48] <Cork> <button> <a> ?
[01:16:10] <Xotix> type=submit yes

[01:34:43] <D4> i.e. it isn't found..
[01:35:46] <Cork> nFFF: look earlier in your code, wfm
[01:36:24] <nFFF> wfm?
[01:36:49] <Cork> Works For Me
[01:37:21] <D4> Anyone?
[01:37:51] <AdvoWork> I'm doing: $(".dblclick").bind("click", function() {  which works fine on static events that were generated on page load, but im adding a table row, with that classname, but that then doesn't work. Any ideas why please?
[01:37:54] <nFFF> yea sorry think it was an old console log
[01:38:02] <nFFF> any idea why im getting 0 for pali?
[01:38:02] <AdvoWork> its definately got the same class name
[01:38:04] <Cork> Xotix: body is the outer most element
[01:38:10] <nFFF> I've changed it slightly
[01:38:13] <Cork> Xotix: you can't use find to filter the selection
[01:38:16] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/WQSvm/1/
[01:38:35] <nFFF> Trying to figure out biggest palindrome from product of two three digit numbers
[01:39:01] <Xotix> Cork ,so how can i search for body within a var?
[01:39:08] <nFFF> err change first and seocnd to 999 :>
[01:39:39] <Xotix> if i use document it works with find, don't get it why it doesn't when using a var.
[01:39:59] <Cork> nFFF: don't you mean > 0 ?
[01:40:14] <bigkevmcd> AdvoWork: use .on or .live (depending on your version of jQuery)
[01:40:15] <Cork> first = 1000 first < 1000 means zero loops
[01:41:27] <nFFF> Yea silly mistake
[01:41:28] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/WQSvm/2/
[01:41:32] <nFFF> but this still doesn't work
[01:41:37] <D4> if ($(listitem).length) <-- how can I check if it doesn't have, e.g. !($(listitem).length) ?
[01:41:46] <nFFF> D4, correct
[01:42:07] <Xotix> Cork, what should i use then? And why does it work if i use document?
[01:42:28] <D4> nFFF » That gives unexpected identifier
[01:42:55] <D4> do I do < 0 or.. == 0 or.. wut!
[01:43:32] <gnagno> Xotix, first = 100; first >= 0; first--
[01:43:47] <Xotix> gnagno: wong person
[01:43:54] <gnagno> sorry Xotix  :)
[01:44:18] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/Mzbjh/
[01:44:28] <nFFF> ^^ D4
[01:44:43] <nFFF> gnagno, you mean me?
[01:44:45] <Cork> Xotix: filter
[01:45:05] <nFFF> my issue is with: product.toString().substring(0, product.length / 2);
[01:45:15] <D4> nFFF » oh, I put it one step too early, thanks
[01:45:17] <nFFF> substring(0, product.length / 2); // this is not working
[01:45:18] <Xotix> Cork, and why does it work with $(document)?
[01:45:20] <Cork> nFFF: first > 0; second > 0; and substr not substring
[01:45:26] <gnagno> nFFF, maybe yes it was for you
[01:45:42] <nFFF> yea Cork, I fixed that
[01:45:55] <Cork> substr too?
[01:45:58] <gnagno> nFFF, if you're the one about palindrome I suggest you to make a separate function to check if a string is palindrome
[01:46:45] <gnagno> something like function palindrome(integer){ if( integer == integer.revert)return true; return false }
[01:47:02] <gnagno> you have to find something to use instead of integer.revert
[01:47:22] <nFFF> shit i know what to do
[01:49:33] <xarxer> Hi.. I have a php class with a static function which return value I want to get with ajax.. Do I really need a third file to call from the javascript?

[01:53:09] <Cork> nFFF: and additionally for you old code break; doesn't get you out from the first loop
[01:56:01] <kollapse> Hi. Isn't there any better way of injecting HTML than $(el).html("Really long huge multi-line html text string that is nigh incomprehensible");  ?
[01:56:23] <Cork> kollapse: no
[01:56:42] <Cork> you can break it up into dom operations if you like
[01:56:53] <Cork> but then its not html :)
[01:57:05] <kollapse> That will just decrease performance.
[01:57:12] <kollapse> Or do you mean native JS DOM handling ?
[01:57:25] <Cork> thats basically the same thing
[01:58:18] <nFFF> Cork, any idea why this isn't playing game: http://jsfiddle.net/WQSvm/4/
[01:58:54] <kollapse> Well I guess I'll have to change the colors in my IDE so JS quotes aren't painted in blood eye-hurting red.
[01:59:01] <Cork> uh... why on earth would you do that??
[01:59:22] <nFFF> To reverse a string ? :>
[01:59:30] <Xotix> Cork, i don't get it. What's wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/tAYDv/1/
[02:00:10] <Cork> nFFF: "1234567".split(/(.)/).reverse().join('')

[02:03:03] <nFFF> Xotix, exactly :>
[02:03:13] <Cork> nFFF: you need to convert the number to a string
[02:03:32] <Cork> ?eval 1234567.toString().split(/(.)/).reverse().join('')

[02:04:59] <nFFF> ok yea thanks
[02:05:03] <nFFF> thinkit might work now
[02:05:12] <nFFF> but my brwoser crashes before i can find the palindrome :<<
[02:06:55] <Cork> Xotix: what your doing isn't really posible
[02:07:08] <Cork> you trying to handle a comple html document
[02:07:37] <Cork> meta tags, doctype and so on doesn't really parse
[02:07:42] <Cork> (no end tags)
[02:10:13] <Cork> nFFF: i don't think it crashes, but it will puke over the big long freez
[02:10:18] <gnagno> nFFF, http://jsfiddle.net/WQSvm/1/
[02:10:29] <Cork> nFFF: when your doing that long loops you need to use timers to let the event queue work
[02:11:14] <AdvoWork> i've got some really basic code here for inline editing. It works so when I click the field it opens the editable box, but then does nothing. http://pastebin.com/RcQx0Rng Any ideas why? I think its because of .live  but I need that because the td is dynamically generated :S
[02:11:21] <Xotix> Cork, again why does example 1 work and example 2 doesn't? http://jsfiddle.net/tAYDv/3/
[02:12:45] <Cork> Xotix: firstly jsfiddle alreay adds doctype, header and so forth, so adding it is actaully broken html
[02:12:45] <AdvoWork> it works fine on non-dynamically generated elements.
[02:13:36] <Cork> Xotix: and if you remove the extra code you get three undefined

[02:15:07] <Andres75> http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/try.html
[02:15:13] <Andres75> Any ideas?
[02:15:34] <Xotix> Cork, it works on my normal page if i pass the document directly. So wheres the difference between $(document) and havin some var with html?
[02:16:02] <Cork> Andres75: uhh. your script tags is outside the html document...
[02:16:15] <Cork> put it before </body> or in head
[02:16:42] <Andres75> lol you are picky :D ... done
[02:16:58] <Cork> Xotix: your example doesn't work so donno
[02:17:12] <nFFF> gnagno, the problem with that method is that it doesn't work with odd length palindromes
[02:17:17] <nFFF> it was a newb mistake
[02:17:23] <Cork> Andres75: that wasn't really picky, but its an invalid html document, so might as well fix it
[02:17:43] <Engin> easiest way to retrieve and present an XML ?
[02:18:08] <Andres75> sure I was kidding, I done it already

[02:18:16] <paissad>     $('#foobar').text("HELLO");
[02:18:18] <Engin> is xslt applicable ?
[02:18:28] <Cork> Andres75: its a bit too much code to find it through skimming the code
[02:18:35] <Cork> and i can't put more time then that right now
[02:19:19] <paissad> if i do ->     $(xml).append('<div id = \'foobar\'>').setText('HELLO');, ... the text 'Hello' is not into the DIV :/
[02:19:20] <Andres75> if you want a pointer, problem must be in setUpScene, gets the wrong IDs
[02:19:48] <Cork> paissad: setText isn't a jquery function
[02:20:06] <paissad> Cork, ah ok
[02:20:26] <paissad> Cork, and then, it's not possible to do what i want in one line ?
[02:20:44] <Cork> just use .text('HELLO')
[02:21:00] <Cork> you need to move it around though
[02:21:10] <Cork> $(xml).append(('<div id = \'foobar\'>').setText('HELLO'));
[02:21:14] <Cork> opps
[02:21:18] <Cork> $(xml).append(('<div id = \'foobar\'>').text('HELLO'));
[02:21:26] <Cork> ...

[02:25:46] <johanhar> Hi. When I e.g got a selector like this: $("#element input:radio"). Are there any "exists" function, to see if the element exists?
[02:26:02] <Andres75> check the length
[02:26:16] <Xotix> Cork, why can't i apply filter() with body on a html object? Where can i ready about that? I don't understand, why there should be a difference between an li tag and a body tag within an html object.
[02:26:19] <johanhar> Okay, thanks.
[02:26:45] <Andres75> $(selector).length > 0 it exists

[02:28:20] <Cork> uh.. it is dom
[02:28:25] <Cork> you don't need to convert it
[02:29:15] <Cork> and you would have to do a full parser sweep to convert an html document to a dom tree
[02:29:22] <LordThumper> Hey does anyone know of a good form validator plugin?
[02:29:27] <Cork> as you can't do it by adding elements to an existing one
[02:29:33] <tocka> morning :)
[02:31:53] <dpn`> hmm, i can check checkboxes but not uncheck them
[02:31:59] <dpn`> tried both attr() and prop()
[02:32:35] <Andres75> @Cork -> Do you know someone I might ask for some help?
[02:32:35] <LordThumper> Did you try removeAttr("checked") ?
[02:32:36] <dpn`> oh i'm a noob.. was setting it to "true"  not true
[02:32:51] <dpn`> thanks LordThumper :)
[02:33:00] <LordThumper> np
[02:39:38] <Cork> Xotix: cause your trying to handle a document as dom elements
[02:39:41] <Cork> and they'r not
[02:43:46] <LordThumper> Does anyone know of a good form validator plugin?
[02:45:48] <Andres75> bassinstance
[02:45:54] <Andres75> just google it
[02:59:19] <Xotix> Thanks Cork btw.    Another question: http://tinyw.in/BLrg Why does the $.post() not work in IE9?
[03:00:07] <Cork> Xotix: XMLHttpRequest doesn't support csp in ie
[03:00:17] <Cork> you need to use XDomainRequest instead
[03:00:29] <Cork> and it can't do post btw
[03:01:53] <Xotix> Cork thanks
[03:02:18] <designaholic> Xotix: or use some kind of JSONP if u need domain stuff
[03:02:35] <designaholic> +xdomain
[03:03:00] <Cork> that sucks though
[03:03:13] <Xotix> using jquery forms should do the trick for me without doing a lot of complicated ie fixes.
[03:03:22] <Cork> i would rather use a proxy script on the same domain
[03:03:55] <D4> <tbody><tr class="item"><td>Item</td><td class="qty">2</td><td><form><input /></td> <-- how do I reach that "qty" where $(this) is the <form><input <<- ?
[03:03:58] <designaholic> Cork: what do you think causes problems with JSONP ?
[03:04:24] <D4> $(this).closest('td') gives me the <td> whereas the form resides in, I need the qty one
[03:04:30] <Cork> designaholic: your loading and executing javascript from a different domain
[03:04:31] <Xotix> Cork, would be a possibility thanks
[03:04:44] <Cork> designaholic: theres many reasons that could leak information
[03:04:57] <Cork> (information like passwords or what not)
[03:05:13] <nFFF> D4. $(this).parentsAll('td')[0]
[03:05:23] <nFFF> I think its parentsall
[03:05:27] <nFFF> ?parentsall
[03:05:29] <nFFF> mayube jsut parents
[03:05:31] <nFFF> ?parents
[03:05:38] <Cork> you want closest
[03:05:40] <Cork> not parents
[03:05:45] <bot-t> nFFF, Couldn't find "parentsall" in jQuery Docs.
[03:05:46] <bot-t> .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[03:05:48] <designaholic> Cork: okay, I'm just using that for an JSON response, so actually there no execution of any js beside of cb(â€¦)
[03:06:07] <nFFF> Cork, closest returns the first matched parent
[03:06:11] <Cork> designaholic: if its jsonp then, yes there is
[03:06:29] <Cork> nFFF: yes, but it does it more efficient then parents[0]
[03:06:45] <nFFF> Yea, but its not the first parent he wants
[03:06:49] <D4> I did closest('tr').find('.qty') is that ok?
[03:06:59] <Cork> should work fine
[03:07:00] <nFFF> [0] was an example to show he can access it as an array
[03:07:59] <nFFF> D4 that won't work
[03:08:10] <D4> it does
[03:08:12] <nFFF> actually it will
[03:08:17] <nFFF> sorry read tr as td :>
[03:10:50] <nFFF> I wonder whats fastest, do you know Cork? $(this).parents('td')[1]; or $(this).closest('tr').find('.qty') ?
[03:12:20] <Aamir> nFFF: http://jsperf.com/sometest/2
[03:12:45] <nFFF> Aamir, but this is closest then find
[03:13:02] <nFFF> also I wonder how it is compared to parentNode.parentNode
[03:16:31] <mathi> hi
[03:17:20] <mathi> how can I exclude all the textarea's from my selector?
[03:20:02] <Xotix> If you have e.g. a set of buttons, eahc got an id, and you got a function. You could do onClick="func(id)". How do i do that with jQuery? Where should  save my parameter?
[03:20:23] <cesaro> ive been just using like
[03:20:32] <cesaro> $(#buttonid).click
[03:22:07] <Xotix> You missunderstood me. Your solution would be, binding the parameter as the id and the doo $(.button).click($(this).attr(id)) that would work, hm
[03:36:44] <Pupeno_W> What does $(function() {}) do? when is that function run?
[03:37:02] <quicksilver> Pupeno_W: it's shorthand for $(document).ready()
[03:45:51] <Andres75> I have broken the problem down to a single image: http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/try.html
[03:46:04] <Andres75> still it renders only the last set...
[03:49:25] <Fox`> if you change the width and position of an element using the animate call do they happen simultaneously or are they queued?
[03:55:05] <jomofcw> Fox` simultaneous
[03:59:10] <phrearch> hey
[03:59:29] <phrearch> is it possible that jquery's ajax function wont interpret the response coming from the request?
[03:59:46] <phrearch> i have some plain text that i want to process, without having it escaped
[04:01:14] <nFFF> your callback function should recieve the data
[04:01:29] <nFFF> if your request returns the string it should work fine
[04:08:17] <D4> I'm adding a <form> with jQ inside a .post() but using it reloads the page, what do I need to do?
[04:10:10] <StevenCodes221> d4 when you catch the submit of the form add return false; to the end
[04:11:03] <D4> StevenCodes221 » I'm already doing that.. I'm "posting", but if there is nothing to begin with, I need to add an entire <tr>stuff</tr>, and some of the stuff includes yet another form
[04:11:33] <StevenCodes221> eh ask me in like 2 hours lmao
[04:13:29] <rami_> Hello. What would be the jQuery selector for all <rect> in this http://pastebin.com/KZshVkf0 ? thanks in advance
[04:14:29] <Alex________> hi all
[04:14:34] <helllen> helllo
[04:14:49] <Alex________> how're u?
[04:15:02] <helllen> how can I have a connector for two posibilities
[04:15:05] <helllen> for example
[04:15:09] <helllen> X1 or X2
[04:15:24] <helllen> '#id1 or #id2'
[04:15:33] <helllen> something like that
[04:15:34] <helllen> ??
[04:15:37] <Alex________> what do you mean when say connector
[04:18:12] <Alex________> doe's anybody add spiner to page? What is the best way to do that?
[04:18:49] <Alex________> For example while sending ajax request
[04:20:56] <Aamir> helllen:  $('#id1, #id2')
[04:21:10] <ascii`> Hi, i'm new to jquery, trying to use the integrated version in wordpress, my code is similar to "jQuery(document).ready(function($) { function foo() { alert(23); } setInterval('foo()',100); });" but i get an undefined reference to foo() in the setInyerval(), probably for a scope issue, may i request your help? :D
[04:21:20] <Aamir> ?ajaxsetup @alex____
[04:21:21] <bot-t> alex____, jQuery.ajaxSetup(options): Set default values for future Ajax requests. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[04:21:34] <helllen> <Aamir>
[04:21:35] <helllen> thanks
[04:22:02] <Aamir> ascii`:  you have document.ready inside document.ready ?
[04:22:12] <Alex________> bot-t thanks
[04:22:23] <Alex________> i'll try
[04:22:35] <ascii`> Aamir, sorry can you expand?
[04:23:02] <ascii`> the code is inside a page body
[04:23:20] <Aamir> ascii`:  pops sorry misread
[04:23:25] <Aamir> opps* :|
[04:25:20] <phrearch> ehm, is it possible to hide the loading cursor while doing an ajax request?
[04:25:33] <Aamir> ascii`:  try   setInterval(foo,100); }
[04:26:09] <Aamir> phrearch: cursor doesn't change when you make an ajax request i guess :|
[04:26:33] <phrearch> Aamir: it may be specific for the browser/os, but i get a waiting cursor
[04:27:17] <Aamir> humm no idea mate, forcing cursor to default using css will not be a good idea
[04:27:54] <ascii`> Aamir, foo not defined as before :\
[04:28:22] <Aamir> ascii` var foo = function(){ your code }
[04:29:33] <ascii`> Aamir, same with that
[04:29:45] <ascii`> do i have to use an anonymous function?
[04:30:21] <Aamir> ascii`:  http://jsfiddle.net/s9PgK/
[04:31:22] <Cork> ascii`: the problem is that you used a string to setInterval
[04:31:31] <Cork> replace it with a function pointer and the rest should work fine
[04:31:44] <Cork> you don't need to use an anonymus function
[04:32:13] <Aamir> ascii`:  see above:  Aamir :  ascii`:  try  setInterval(foo,100); }
[04:32:15] <ascii`> Cork, very true, thanks a lot! Aamir thanks you too :)
[04:32:47] <Aamir> ascii`:  http://jsfiddle.net/s9PgK/1/ :D
[04:32:59] <ascii`> :))))
[04:33:40] <jeffsmykil> Recomended table plugin that does ajax and can do real time filtering via a text box?
[04:35:57] <freakabcd> Aamir, i didn;t get that example. I thought it should become faster and faster as it progresses
[04:36:10] <freakabcd> cos you are setting up too many setInterval()s
[04:36:23] <Aamir> freakabcd:  no its just one
[04:36:45] <Aamir> calling foo after every 100 ms
[04:36:52] <freakabcd> eh.. setTimeout is the one you want, right?
[04:37:26] <Aamir> freakabcd:  it was reply to ascii` code so not sure what he is trying to do :)
[04:37:40] <Cork> freakabcd: no setinverval calls on an aprox interval the same function
[04:37:56] <Cork> freakabcd: setTimeout only calls once
[04:38:08] <freakabcd> Cork, yeah, but on the next run you call it again, no?
[04:38:18] <ascii`> it's a slideshow
[04:38:38] <Cork> freakabcd: you can use setTimeout for that yes
[04:38:58] <faraway_> hi. i have an element and now i wan't to listen to a mouse down event for all children with a certain class. i tried this: element.on("mousedown","> .the-class",  â€¦ )  which does not work. i want to use the ".on" cause the list with ".the-class" elements is dynamic
[04:38:59] <Cork> freakabcd: but setInterval runs until you call clearInterval
[04:39:12] <freakabcd> Cork, that particular example: http://jsfiddle.net/s9PgK/2/
[04:39:20] <freakabcd> notice the difference with using setTimeout
[04:39:29] <Cork> freakabcd: that only runs once
[04:39:32] <freakabcd> it prints the = only once
[04:39:33] <freakabcd> why?
[04:39:40] <Cork> as your never setting the next setTimeout
[04:39:42] <freakabcd> on the next run it should schedule it to be run *again*
[04:40:03] <freakabcd> wait lol
[04:40:19] <freakabcd> that set* call is *outside* the function
[04:40:26] <Cork> freakabcd: this is the same as the setInterval http://jsfiddle.net/s9PgK/3/
[04:40:26] * freakabcd blames his eyesight!
[04:41:11] <skylamer`> what's best suited for clientside templating ( jquery tmpl, knockoutjs, jade ... ) ? :)
[04:41:42] <Cork> skylamer`: my recomendations would be jqote2
[04:41:57] <Cork> ?g jqote2
[04:41:59] <bot-t> Cork, jQote2 – Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code - http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[04:42:19] <skylamer`> is it simple and light?
[04:42:25] <Cork> yes
[04:42:39] <Cork> and its the fastest one at the moment
[04:42:55] <skylamer`> but isnt really 'more' developing?
[04:43:00] <skylamer`> https://github.com/aefxx/jQote2
[04:44:05] <StevenCodes22> anyone here know about legal issues with website or know a room?
[04:44:14] <Cork> skylamer`: well there isn't any open bugs that talks agenst it
[04:44:45] <skylamer`> idk
[04:45:05] <Cork> skylamer`: its quite normal for jquery plugins to go silent from time to time
[04:45:07] <AdvoWork> i've got some basic code that sets a field to editable: http://jsfiddle.net/D4Btg/ which works perfectly, but now im trying to say, after its finished editing then allow me to do an alert. Where I have the alert now it just alerts as soon as I click in the field and wont then make editable. Any idea how I can call it afterwards?
[04:45:37] <StevenCodes22> f*n science homework is teaching me about domain names wtf?
[04:45:47] <Cork> skylamer`: and the next will most likly be part of jquery-ui
[04:46:08] <Cork> skylamer`: they'r taking ovcer the tmpl project, but starting from scratch
[04:46:22] <Cork> *over
[04:46:29] <jeffsmykil> Best jquery table solution with live filtering?
[04:46:56] <skylamer`> tmpl waz guud
[04:47:04] <skylamer`> so may be knockjs, or with jade
[04:47:10] <skylamer`> http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating/357
[04:47:43] <skylamer`> jqote near ~ 1 000 000
[04:47:44] <skylamer`> xaxa
[04:48:25] <skylamer`> itz fast
[04:50:16] <skylamer`> https://github.com/olado/doT this get more faster
[04:56:24] <faraway_> could someone look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/nVgm6/   i want the same selector as i use for find with the .on statement
[04:56:54] <Alex________> bot-t are you here?
[05:01:44] <Andres75> anyone up for some jquery weirdness?
[05:01:56] <Andres75> http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/try.html

[05:03:13] <aqeel> hi room
[05:05:10] <poppiez> can this be done in a cleaner way (replacing a class)? $('html').removeClass('not-awesome').addClass('awesome');

[05:06:35] <aqeel> no
[05:06:51] <aqeel> $('html').toggleClass('not-awesome','awsome')
[05:07:05] <poppiez> hmm, I read the docs earlier. it said second argument wanted a boolean?
[05:07:39] <poppiez> hmm, "not just truthy/falsy"
[05:07:44] <poppiez> oh well. thx a lot! works :)
[05:07:48] <aqeel> .toggleClass( className, switch )

[05:18:15] <aqeel> jslint shows your code having some errors
[05:19:49] <D4> aqeel » Well.. It's running.
[05:20:28] <aqeel> yes it does but error free is much better to have .....sometimes missing semi colon do intend to give headaches
[05:21:02] <mllie> I have a problem in IE, when opening a window with window.open the parent window gets focused and the new opened window is hidden behind the parnet window. How can I fix that?
[05:21:13] <D4> That page gives me headaches, complaining about a space too much? if( something ) <-- sigh.. not really my issue atm, I need to be able to run the function again at line 56 - not fix the syntax lint says :p
[05:21:30] <aqeel> ok...
[05:24:22] <aqeel> try to have a habbit of placing if (){}.....in this format
[05:24:28] <tankblergh> can someone recommend at good table sorting plugin?
[05:24:50] <sj0bidoo> is there simple way to resize an image if it's width exceeds a certain variable ? Found a few examples, but they all set max width AND max height.i only need to scale the image if it's width is larger than X. And preferably not to only set size to 50%..rather than set width = x and scale height accordingly :)
[05:26:55] <Zogot_> tankblergh: datatables
[05:31:05] <tankblergh> thanks
[05:31:17] <aqeel> sj0bidoo.......max height and max width have no visual effect on the palcement.....if the element indeed is larger then it will take that into account.....max is only used so that resizing browser windows will not drop the height and width from that set max height and max width
[05:31:33] <Andres75> still no go with this -> http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/try.html
[05:31:35] <Andres75> any help?

[05:45:54] <andreas83> D4 so to speack ....   one soloution could be: make a onclick, hehe or maybe the fadein have a callback where you can add your click handler
[05:45:57] <billiejean> farkie why you not use jsfiddle ?

[05:58:02] <freakabcd> Farkie, works now
[05:58:05] <Farkie> :)
[05:58:08] <freakabcd> what was the problem again
[05:58:09] <freakabcd> ?
[05:58:52] <Farkie> the button
[05:58:56] <Farkie> sorry
[05:59:01] <Farkie> Vague as could be
[05:59:24] <freakabcd> what do you men the button? i meant to ask how did you fix it
[05:59:26] <Farkie> erm, the "test code" button didn't submit
[05:59:28] <Farkie> i have no idea
[05:59:43] <Shambat> are ajax queries inherently slower than a regular http get via browser? I have some $.ajax() queries that are a lot slower (x5-10) than accessing the data via browser directly...
[05:59:49] <freakabcd> what? it works now and wasn;t before, right?
[05:59:52] <Farkie> used $(function()) {
[06:01:39] <gnagno> is it possible to search for an element given another element as scope? for example I already did something like myelement = $("#elementid"), and now I want to find the element with id = anotherid which is one of his descendent
[06:02:03] <aqeel> yes u can
[06:02:04] <Andres75> $('#elem').find()
[06:02:22] <freakabcd> other than jquery and prototype is there anything else that provides the $('mydiv')  way of selecting stuff ?
[06:02:55] <Cork> extjs if i remember correctly
[06:03:09] <gnagno> Andres75, is that for me?
[06:03:17] <Andres75> yup
[06:03:43] <gnagno> thank you very much then :)
[06:03:44] <freakabcd> ok thanks. i'm looking at some code and can't find anywhere that it loads jquery or prototype and yet it uses $('mybox). ... liberally and i can;t seem to find out why it works!
[06:03:46] <Aamir> Andres75:  $('#elem').find('#anotherid')
[06:04:08] <Aamir> oppps its for gnagno
[06:04:12] <Cork> $('mybox') doesn't sound like jquery
[06:04:27] <Cork> freakabcd: what does inspecting $ give you ?
[06:04:39] <Andres75> <mybox>
[06:04:45] <Cork> (a link would help)
[06:04:52] <Cork> no i meant the function $
[06:05:00] <Cork> not a call to it with ('mybox')
[06:05:08] <AdvoWork> anyone know why when im doing: var row = $(this).closest("tr").get(0);oTable = $('#table').dataTable();	var aData = oTable.fnGetData(row);console.log(aData);  its showing the old original data that was generated, rather than what i've just changed it to?

[06:05:56] <webguynow> http://pastebin.com/bZyq5apm
[06:06:05] <Cork> AdvoWork: cause your storeing a pointer to the old dom element
[06:06:20] <Cork> AdvoWork: dataTable most likly replaces the entire table or something like that
[06:06:51] <aqeel> my problem stay puts....
[06:07:24] <webguynow> based on array.contains(obj) in JavaScript  SO link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/237104/array-containsobj-in-javascript  which also mentions jQuery  Array#inArray.  Suggestions most welcome
[06:08:25] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[06:08:44] <freakabcd> Cork, on webconsole in FF, $ simply returns function $(x) {return document.getElementById(x);}
[06:09:09] <Cork> freakabcd: and $.fn or $.prototype?
[06:09:30] <aqeel> click link1 in main menu then one link in submenu now click submenu button 2 times

[06:15:00] <freakabcd> Cork, is it in there? i mean jquery or some other lib is loaded from basic.js ?
[06:15:29] <kampsun> there's function $(x) { ... } in that file
[06:15:45] <Cork> nope just a minimalistic function to handle getElementById
[06:16:07] <aqeel> any please look into my issue
[06:16:47] <Cork> freakabcd: so its no framework, just a wrapper function to reduce document.getElementById to $
[06:17:03] <freakabcd> lol, my eyesight
[06:17:16] <xec> what a welcome
[06:17:19] <aqeel> o.O....

[06:19:25] <Andres75> do you know where I can find someone that i can hire to solve my problem?
[06:21:04] <billiejean> andreas75 use friverr
[06:21:42] <Andres75> what's that
[06:22:21] <AdvoWork> Cork, what part is referencing the old pointer?
[06:22:25] <billiejean> see fiverr.com
[06:23:54] <D4> I'm appending a form withing .post() and I need this form to use the ajax .post() as well - How can I re-initiate the code so this newly appended form also 'works'?
[06:24:01] <D4> within* even
[06:24:55] <nFFF> what do you mean work? does your post request return a html string (form) ? that your then appending to an element within the DOM?
[06:25:06] <xec> D4: "appending a form" means adding form controls?
[06:25:28] <D4> xec » Actually .append('<tr>....<form etc>')
[06:25:42] <xec> oh i see
[06:25:53] <D4> I'm in turn using this form to run the .post() but, inside the post it's not.. well, loaded/usable/working
[06:26:13] <webguynow> (Help or PMs welcome) I'm trying to find the index of a sibling link, when it is clicked (have pastebin and similar code examples to model from) but need a better method - so far, not working
[06:26:34] <xec> D4: well, you can bind to the form after you created it, or use a delegate to listen to events on elements that do not exist yet
[06:27:05] <xec> webguynow: do you have a live demo?
[06:27:09] <D4> Anything that will fix this atm is so much appreciated ;p What would be best? I don't know how to do either so if you could elaborate I'd love it!
[06:27:54] <webguynow> http://pastebin.com/bZyq5apm
[06:28:43] <xec> D4: well, assuming you have a container element that you will put the new form in you can do $(".container").on("submit", "form", function(){ console.log("will work on new forms added"); });
[06:28:52] <webguynow> but I'll also throw it in Tinkerbin or Fiddle
[06:28:57] <xec> i think...
[06:28:58] <xec> :D
[06:29:12] <D4> Aha, yes I do have a container - Here's the ugly snippet I'm running now:
[06:29:48] <D4> https://gist.github.com/986d9fca3c16cb5a2c61 <-- so could I at line 2 change the .click to something like .on("submit")... ?
[06:32:11] <webguynow> can run a little easier here: http://tinkerbin.com/RDknNTY1
[06:32:20] <webguynow>  no console though
[06:32:29] <xec> D4: i think maybe i have misunderstood you. where is this append call?
[06:32:57] <D4> xec » line 55ish
[06:33:30] <xec> ah i see it, one long line :D
[06:33:51] <nFFF> D4, is the response from your request all valid etc?
[06:33:59] <D4> yeah, for now.. as it isn't really working as I want it to, and that is only one of 2 forms to be added, but the "function" of post etc doesn't work
[06:34:20] <D4> nFFF » Well, the other stuff works, but that "append" is used when there isn't anything.. like "first" time adding
[06:34:54] <nFFF> so response isn't null?
[06:34:57] <D4> So, first time adding add the form to add more of that, or remove (decrease) but it doesn't function since the jQ .post() stuff is already done and appending this after simply doesn't work
[06:35:08] <nFFF> and returns a valid obj?
[06:35:32] <xec> D4: it's a bit too much code to just see what it's doing - the click event you define at line 2 - you want this to trigger on submit of the new form as well?
[06:35:33] <D4> nFFF » It adds the stuff with append, but the stuff added doesn't function
[06:35:57] <D4> xec » Yes, if that is possible.. It was .submit() first, then I changed to .click() hoping it would fix the 'added' form
[06:36:13] <D4> xec » But, my attempt at doing it is commented at line 60
[06:36:23] <xec> okay, then yes - you can use .on() instead and it might do the trick
[06:36:34] <D4> simply just .on instead of .click?
[06:36:50] <nFFF> well on('click'
[06:36:54] <xec> D4: no, read the doc, see ?on
[06:36:54] <bot-t> D4, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:37:03] <nFFF> you need to bind to the parent element
[06:37:22] <billiejean> hello how to make link work when i want to change tabs ?
[06:37:24] <xec> D4: essentially, you bind to the parent container element (that always exists) and then filter using the second argument
[06:38:11] <xec> D4: something like $(MY CONTAINER SELECTOR).on("submit", MY FORM SELECTOR, function(){ console.log("will work on new forms added"); });
[06:38:48] <D4> xec » What would the container selector be, the container holding the form selector?
[06:39:06] <xec> D4: yes. any common parent
[06:39:17] <xec> or ancestor
[06:39:51] <xec> you could even do $(document).on(... etc
[06:41:42] <D4> xec » So if <td class="forms"><form ...><input /></form><form.. I could do $('.forms').on('submit', '.wl_add_item, .wl_remove_item', function() {}); ?
[06:42:09] <D4> where the <form class is wl_add_item/wl_remove_item
[06:43:43] <xec> D4: um. if you're nesting tables, then yes - perhaps
[06:43:56] <xec> D4: as long as .forms isn't something you add via ajax later on
[06:44:07] <D4> it isn't, it's "already" there
[06:44:15] <AdvoWork> don't suppose anyone here has a really good understanding of Datatables/Jeditable ?
[06:44:24] <xec> good, then it should "work" :D
[06:45:01] <D4> xec » When clicking on the new <input /> form element the page "reloads"
[06:45:17] <xec> awesome, so it works!
[06:45:47] <D4> Hm, well, the .append() works, but when using what's appended the page reloads, which I'd like to prevent hence using the .post() stuff
[06:46:26] <xec> D4: any chance you could make a demo? ignore the ajax part, just add to the dom on a click or something
[06:46:42] <g[r]eek> Hi fellas. I'm using jquery ajax() to update a list of elements dynamically. Once the list is loaded, I'd like to highlight one of the list elements. What's the best way to do this?
[06:47:19] <Cork> g[r]eek: add a class to the element
[06:47:31] <xec> billiejean: we need (a lot) more information to know what you're talking about. and, seeing is believing= see ?demo
[06:47:31] <bot-t> billiejean, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:48:37] <Lichurec> Hi there
[06:48:55] <D4> xec » I'll try to do a jsfiddle as well
[06:49:46] <g[r]eek> Cork, thanks. Ok so I've got a class on the elements. I'm calling ajax() from my_function(), and then after I call ajax(), I proceed to highlight the specified class. However the highlighting code is run before the ajax() method - which is asynchronous - loads the list. And unfortunately I cannot edit the ajax() method's success callback function. I was wondering if there's a way to "delay" the highlighting code until the other function
[06:49:46] <g[r]eek> (which contains the ajax call) completes. But I can see now that editing the callback is my only option.
[06:51:26] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[06:51:46] <microhxo> I am having trouble with this....  $("this").attr("id") is undefined
[06:51:50] <pachet> why not just have the CSS class itself do the highlighting
[06:52:23] <aqeel> main menu...link 1.....sub menu link one.....again sub menu link one......sub menu works by clicking 2 times?
[06:53:55] <xec> webguynow: tinkerbin isn't great for debugging code depending on libraries. could you make it a jafiddle instead? also remove anything that isn't relevant, and add your question in a comment on a relevant place
[06:56:42] <Jon47> I noticed that when you type in a textarea, the value property changes but the actual DOM text node returned by the jquery .text() method retains the initial value, does anybody know if this is consistent across browsers?
[06:57:46] <BillCriswell> Jon47: I believe it's consistent. You want to use .val() on it.
[06:58:25] <Jon47> BillCriswell thanks, i checked FF10 and Chrome 17.. probably better make sure IE does it too, but it seems legit
[06:58:50] <Jon47> i'm interesting in using the .text() value to determine the "initial" value of the textarea, to compare the val() to in order to see if it's changed
[06:59:22] <BillCriswell> Jon47: Got it.
[07:01:47] <xec> D4: i did some testing and it looks it's better to listen to click than submit
[07:02:01] <xec> D4: http://jsfiddle.net/FkEYC/
[07:02:44] <BillCriswell> xec: What are you trying to do?
[07:02:51] <xec> no, i had a typo in my test with submit, ignore that, it works --> http://jsfiddle.net/FkEYC/1/
[07:03:19] <xec> BillCriswell: trying to help D4 :D he's adding a form in an ajax call and listening to clicks in it
[07:03:30] <chris_w> If I wanted to remove all the elements with the class 'tmp' from inside and element called #myPage, would it be :  $('#myPage').find('.tmp).remove();
[07:03:46] <aqeel> no
[07:03:50] <chris_w> or is that just removing the elements from the results of find()
[07:04:09] <BillCriswell> chris_w: That should work just fine, minus the syntax error.
[07:04:12] <aqeel> $("*").removeClass("tmp");
[07:04:26] <aqeel> * ==> all elementsw in the entire page
[07:04:30] <chris_w> I don't want to remove the class, I want to remove all elements with that class
[07:04:37] <aqeel> yes
[07:04:40] <chris_w> and I only want to remove elements with that class inside #myPAge
[07:04:41] <BillCriswell> aqeel: That's overkill.
[07:04:43] <aqeel> ok...
[07:04:44] <xec> aqeel: reread the question
[07:04:47] <chris_w> :)
[07:05:04] <aqeel> i know but he said all elements/......
[07:05:11] <BillCriswell> chris_w: You can just do $('#myPage .tmp').remove() as well.
[07:05:15] <xec> aqeel: "inside #myPage"
[07:05:29] <xec> aqeel: plus, removeClass removes the class name, not the element...
[07:05:35] <chris_w> BillCriswell, that's neater
[07:05:41] <aqeel> sorry for that part...but attr()
[07:05:57] <chris_w> I don't want to remove the class name, I want to destroy all elements with that class
[07:06:02] <aqeel> i agree it is overkill but people ask in thus way
[07:06:06] <chris_w> BillCriswell, will try that now thanks
[07:06:30] <BillCriswell> He said he wants to remove all elements with the class "tmp" inside "#myPage". Not remove the class name.
[07:06:41] <aqeel> i got it...
[07:06:43] <xec> aqeel: we all have brainfarts, it's OK, just try not to stick to the bad ideas you have ;)
[07:06:59] <aqeel> not bad but i am useds to too mshort cuts
[07:07:35] <aqeel> any how cheers
[07:07:39] <chris_w> BillCriswell,  where do I send the cheque? :)
[07:07:41] <aqeel> ;)\
[07:07:51] <chris_w> thanks all
[07:08:07] <aqeel> ;)
[07:08:07] <chris_w> I'm starting to realize how madingly powerful jquery is
[07:08:14] <aqeel> yup
[07:08:29] <aqeel> it sure is.....like hell in heaven or otherway around...
[07:08:44] <chris_w> I'm working on my first (propper) mobile app using JQM
[07:08:48] <aqeel>  but again no human is perfect
[07:08:55] <BillCriswell> You can send it to John Resig.
[07:09:20] <D4> xec » Bah, seeing your example working so fluidly and trying to 'incorporate' it failing badly haha! I don't get it
[07:09:31] <aqeel> lol
[07:09:36] <xec> aqeel: http://jquery.org/donate :D
[07:09:37] <aqeel> this is code...
[07:09:42] <xec> sorry, chris_w ^
[07:09:56] <chris_w> ha! That's ok, there is no cheque....
[07:09:58] <xec> aqeel: this is SPARTA!!
[07:10:11] <aqeel> lets roll then....
[07:10:17] <aqeel> ugghhhhhhhhh
[07:10:25] <aqeel> ;)
[07:11:46] <BillCriswell> chris_w: Haha. I know what you mean.
[07:12:09] <aqeel> hey please any why my sub menu is not working on one click
[07:12:29] <chris_w> I'm really missing a bit of software from back in my hard-core IRC days, kirc, which had this cool ticker mode so It could sit at the top of the screen and just scroll the conversation going on.
[07:14:59] <fof> D4: instead of attaching handlers to each new element added, you just attache one to a container element along with what child elements to trigger it on
[07:15:00] <fof> i think
[07:15:39] <BillCriswell> fof: yup.
[07:16:46] <aqeel> u can use on (instead of attaching handlers to each new element added, you just attache one to a container element along with what child elements to trigger it on)
[07:16:51] <Chopps> hi guys, i have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/sWCyN/1/ what i need to do is execute the on change event on document ready, can anyone help me out with this please? thank you so much
[07:18:13] <BillCriswell> D4: It seems like $('.some-form').on('submit', function(e) {}); with 1.7 should handle this without you having to use event delegation.
[07:20:59] <AdvoWork> don't suppose anyone here has a really good understanding of Datatables/Jeditable ?
[07:22:27] <nFFF> Chopps
[07:22:29] <nFFF> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/sWCyN/2/
[07:24:11] <nFFF> BillCriswell, you can't bind directly for future elements
[07:24:24] <nFFF> ?on or ?delegate
[07:24:26] <bot-t> nFFF, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:24:56] <nFFF> but delegate is now replaced by on
[07:25:12] <nFFF> all delegation in 1.7 is done with on() afaik
[07:25:59] <DerekPioneer> can i edit js files on remote sites using chrome's developer tools and have the changes be reflected?
[07:26:01] <BillCriswell> nFFF: What does the "As of jQuery 1.7 .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method" mean?
[07:26:22] <DerekPioneer> like if i went to yahoo.com and opened up one of their javascript files and put an alert at the top in chrome's developer tools
[07:26:29] <DerekPioneer> would that alert come up when i ran that function?
[07:26:37] <DerekPioneer> i can't figure out if i'm just doing something wrong or this isn't possible
[07:26:39] <BillCriswell> Ah I see what I did wrong now.
[07:26:45] <Chopps> oh damn i got disconnected and my bnc buffer is not working, did i miss something regarding my question after this: <nFFF> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/sWCyN/2/ ?
[07:27:21] <nFFF> Chopps, .. is that what you wanted?
[07:27:37] <nFFF> BillCriswell, that you should now use on()
[07:28:23] <Chopps> nFFF yes like that but without removing the on change event
[07:28:26] <Chopps> thanks
[07:29:00] <BillCriswell> nFFF: Got it.
[07:29:07] <nFFF> Chopps, what do you mean?
[07:29:40] <nFFF> you mean simply cut and paste your event into document.ready?
[07:29:46] <nFFF> are you inable of doing that yourself?
[07:31:19] <Chopps> nFFF, if u noticed i had an on() function, to be able to change the contents of the 2nd select, and you removed it, i dont want to remove it, i need it, but i also need to execute the same code the on() funcion has on document.ready
[07:31:55] <nFFF> so copy and apste it into document.ready?
[07:32:00] <nFFF> Am I missing something here?
[07:33:32] <Chopps> nop, ure not, but i was trying to reuse the on() function, but i guess this will have to do
[07:34:19] <Carlitta87> i cant get my javscript to do a nice flash jump to an anchor :/ is scrollTo outdated or sumthing?
[07:36:28] <BillCriswell> What's a flash jump?
[07:42:13] <LordThumper> When should I declare my event handlers?
[07:42:29] <LordThumper> Such as $("#div").on('click',function ())
[07:42:46] <LordThumper> In $(document).ready() ?
[07:43:07] <b-lew> is there anyway to make this page scroll vertically but not horizontally? http://ocp.delineamultimedia.com/HTML/horizontal.html
[07:43:21] <JackBauer24> LordThumper: yes
[07:43:28] <LordThumper> For some reason my event handlers attached twice when put in $(function () { })
[07:43:36] <LordThumper> are attached*
[07:44:33] <LordThumper> Probably something to do with Ajax
[07:44:59] <darcyclarke> LordThumber test case?
[07:45:24] <darcyclarke> or perhaps you're doing something like: are you doing $(function(){ $(document).ready(function(){ ... }); }); ?
[07:45:38] <darcyclarke> which is the same thing twice
[07:46:07] <LordThumper> No just $(function () { })
[07:46:39] <LordThumper> I removed the document.ready tags and the event handlers are still fired
[07:46:45] <LordThumper> once this time
[07:46:55] <darcyclarke> nice
[07:48:12] <LordThumper> This is strange
[07:48:35] <aqeel> chopps clone your function to reuse
[07:48:36] <LordThumper> Seens Chrome loads resources after their ancestors are all visible
[07:49:05] <TheKaiser> has anybody tried using draggable droppable with appendTo?
[07:49:06] <LordThumper> And runs the script inside the container automatically
[07:50:17] <LordThumper> For example <div id="bar" style="display:none;"><img src="foo"/></div>
[07:50:44] <LordThumper> The img is only loaded when/if #bar is display:block;
[07:51:03] <LordThumper> So confused atm
[07:53:46] <aqeel> what u want to do...
[07:53:54] <aqeel> load image at background
[07:54:03] <aqeel> or hide first then show?
[07:54:32] <aqeel> if u want to load image at background can make use of 2 div and zindex
[07:56:22] <LordThumper> <div id="foo"><script type="text/javascript">$("#bar").on('click',function () {})</script></div>
[07:56:33] <LordThumper> When foo starts as display:none
[07:56:56] <LordThumper> And becomes display:block, the script inside is automatically executed
[07:57:12] <LordThumper> Is that normal behaviour or am I missing something?
[08:00:01] <joikus> I'm trying to fireoff a $.get when you scroll near the bottom, but only once, http://pastebin.com/DSGXPyvM
[08:00:11] <joikus> right now it does it tons of times
[08:04:40] <LordThumper> For someone reason document.ready is fired for the second time after I open a Fancybox
[08:04:44] <LordThumper> some*
[08:08:11] <TheKaiser> hey
[08:08:28] <TheKaiser> any idea how to make a draggable appendTo a droppable?
[08:08:42] <Chopps> <aqeel> chopps clone your function to reuse < anyone knows how to do that?
[08:09:17] <raj> Chopps, how do you reuse a function?
[08:09:19] <raj> name it
[08:10:03] <Chopps> just call it again?
[08:10:34] <raj> i don't know the details of what you're trying to do, but yes, if you wanna use a function again, it needs to be named...and then you can just call it again
[08:17:27] <b-lew> is there a jQuery fix for overflow-y:scroll; in ie7?
[08:24:36] <jita> Any idea why this code does not work http://dpaste.org/DOgcY/ ?
[08:24:43] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm trying to do a $.getJSON() with JSONP from another domain, but the response content-type is text/plain, so I'm getting the error "Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/plain" - any way to get it to work?
[08:24:45] <jita> when the division is updated using ajax
[08:24:48] <jita> it stops working
[08:25:38] <timwis> n/m
[08:30:50] <jkrebs> is there a similar function to .get(), but instead of returning a dom element it returns a jquery object ?
[08:31:51] <jkrebs> or should i do $(elems.get(5))
[08:32:58] <Heshanh> how do u select all the next() elements
[08:33:34] <AaronCampbell> I see a lot of various options for grabbing all external links on a page with jQuery, but I'm wondering if there's an "accepted" method that's as optimized as possible
[08:33:54] <AaronCampbell> Example of several options:

[08:34:39] <optikalmouse> anyone know how to debug sticky windows/
[08:34:39] <optikalmouse> ?
[08:34:56] <optikalmouse> jquery keeps closing the window after a few seconds and after I hover out of it.....
[08:35:06] <optikalmouse> makes it impossible to debug the CSS for it :S
[08:37:03] <timwis> Is there a way to catch if a $.getJSON() with JSONP failed? as in the URL didn't work or something?
[08:37:39] <timwis> .error() doesn't seem to work with JSONP
[08:37:53] <ag4ve> how do i get at one level up?

[08:41:10] <nFFF> isn't that the same thing? :<
[08:41:37] <jkrebs> nFFF: i can't use .eq() to first get index 4 and then .eq() to get index 6

[08:46:27] <LukeNukem> Hello, if i use php to echo my html in html comments, i can use jquery to remove those comments and display it as normal html content right
[08:46:40] <LukeNukem> but keeping the view source commented sort of way
[08:48:01] <Lichurec> LukeNukem: why would you want to do so?
[08:48:44] <LukeNukem> Lichurec, make it a bit more tougher for people to just randomly steal my website design and its format or interface
[08:49:40] <gnagno> suppose I have a piece of dom containing an image resource is it possible to "copy" this image to some other part of my dom without making another request to the server and leaving a copy in the original position ?
[08:49:45] <Lichurec> LukeNukem: that's pointlessâ€¦ whatever you push to the browser - is easily copyableâ€¦ and placing parts of the page as "comments" won't help you with that
[08:51:18] <Lichurec> LukeNukem:  theoretically JS has no access to HTML commentsâ€¦ theoreticallyâ€¦ practically - you may read sth like: http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1563-jQuery-Comments-Plug-in-To-Access-HTML-Comments-For-DOM-Templating.htm
[08:51:20] <fof> you could obfuscate your js if you really want
[08:52:47] <Lichurec> gnagno: browser should not re-request the file if it has it in a local cacheâ€¦ so simple .clone() should work
[08:52:56] <LukeNukem> Lichurec, i was wondering how facebook did it o.o
[08:53:16] <gnagno> thank you Lichurec
[08:53:33] <gnagno> I didn't try with clone()
[08:53:42] <Lichurec> gnagno: but testing would be suggested ;)
[08:54:14] <gnagno> yes, I am testing by following the apache log to see if there's another request
[08:54:55] <Lichurec> practically - I think it's more a engine matter than language matterâ€¦
[08:56:21] <Lichurec> LukeNukem: you can manually traverse the DOM looking for commentsâ€¦ alwaysâ€¦
[08:56:35] <LukeNukem> traverse?
[08:57:15] <Lichurec> have you read the article I sent you? You have a live example there ;)
[08:58:24] <Lichurec> yes - traverse: go trough every single node and check if it is a comment node or notâ€¦
[08:58:58] <maxer69> what json does my php need to return in order to get a success message when doing $.ajax?
[08:59:23] <Eviltwin> It needs to return JSON
[08:59:37] <Eviltwin> And have a successful status code
[08:59:54] <chris_w> I think {} will even work for a success
[09:01:50] <domcat> is there any way to add gaussian blur effect to element?
[09:02:14] <Eviltwin> Not widely supported
[09:02:17] <maxer69> im returning $return['Success'] = true; with json_encode and still not working- do i have to specify a return type or something?
[09:03:36] <chris_w> maxer69,  is it on the same domain?  Are you falling for the cross-domain problems ?
[09:03:37] <nFFF> :D
[09:03:45] <chris_w> maxer69, I don't set output headers on mine
[09:04:37] <chris_w> maxer69, in theory,  $tmp = array(); echo json_encode($tmp);     will even work
[09:04:43] <K3|Chris|Work> anyone knows a way to make $(".ItemDiv:nth-child(6n+2)") and $(".ItemDiv:nth-child(6n+3)") wrapped in a div?
[09:04:58] <K3|Chris|Work> but otherwise still the same place in dom order etc
[09:05:10] <Eviltwin> Comma them together
[09:05:21] <Eviltwin> And appendTo a new div
[09:05:23] <chris_w> maxer69, what's the console log saying when you try to request it?
[09:05:24] <ag4ve> if i do something like $('thing').each( function() { this.add(something); } ) is jquery going to try to write to the dom for each iteration of the loop?
[09:05:49] <K3|Chris|Work> Eviltwin: thanks I'll try that, but wouldn't that put the new div at the end of that list?
[09:05:53] <Eviltwin> ag4ve: Not with .add
[09:05:55] <ag4ve> .... or is it smart enough to push onto a stack and do all the work at the end?
[09:06:19] <Eviltwin> What?
[09:06:31] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ ag4ve
[09:06:32] <bot-t> ag4ve, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[09:07:27] <ag4ve> i was wondering whether jquery does any optimization or not
[09:07:55] <nFFF> ag4ve, there's no explicity memory allocation in javascript/jquery
[09:07:56] <Eviltwin> ag4ve: It does in certain situations but I still don't understand the situation
[09:08:04] <artiintell> how to check whether mcdropdown is changed
[09:08:07] <Eviltwin> Hence I'd like to see code
[09:08:18] <artiintell> can someone write down the syntax for me?
[09:08:33] <nFFF> Eviltwin, he's basically asking if you can add objects to the stack rather than heap
[09:08:39] <nFFF> or if it does
[09:08:45] <Eviltwin> No...
[09:09:00] <Eviltwin> Apparently you don't know what the jQuery stack is
[09:11:34] <maxer69> chris_w the firebug response is {"Success":true}
[09:11:49] <ag4ve> so, some methods will do in-place dom updates and others will collect the information and update all at once. i'm guessing that if you update elements in one place it will happen with one update...?
[09:12:17] <chris_w> maxer69, so that's the json generated by php
[09:12:24] <chris_w> anything being logged in the Console?
[09:12:41] <ajpiano> ag4ve: .add doesn't touch the dom, it manipulates the jquery collection in memory.  if you do $(".foo").each(function() {  $(this).append("bar"); }); it will touch the DOM on every iteration of the loop
[09:13:29] <JAAulde> i reeeeea;;y want to use Eric Hynds' notification UI widget as its UI themable and, we'', it's written by Eric. According to http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/a-jquery-ui-growl-ubuntu-notification-widget/ however, the last update to it was in Jul 2010
[09:13:47] <JAAulde> Anyone use it or know anything about it's stability or compatibility with newer jQ/UI ?
[09:13:53] <ajpiano> erichynds might
[09:14:04] <erichynds> that's because the code is perfect and does not require updating
[09:14:04] <JAAulde> ha, yes, I suppose he might
[09:14:09] <initself> I've been using tablesorter() like this: $("table").tablesorter();
[09:14:17] <initself> never mind
[09:14:18] <erichynds> JAAulde: mekwall has a fork that is better
[09:14:19] <JAAulde> erichynds: that's what my UX guy said.  I just wanted to confirm! :D
[09:14:28] <Latiwa> hello @ all,is there an jquery GER channel?my english is not so good^^
[09:14:35] <JAAulde> erichynds: ok, will Google it.  thanks!
[09:14:44] <JAAulde> erichynds: I assume it's UI themable?
[09:14:58] <erichynds> JAAulde: yeah. https://github.com/mekwall/jquery-ui-notification
[09:15:57] <JAAulde> erichynds: super, thanks a lot.
[09:16:05] <erichynds> np
[09:16:34] <ag4ve> ajpiano: ok thanks, i've started looking at jquey optimization (and benchmarking) and finding some interesting stuff....
[09:17:02] <ajpiano> ag4ve: have you seen http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/03/43439-reasons-to-use-append-correctly
[09:17:08] <Latiwa> ok i will try it in english^^ my question is,can i change the following script http://codeassembly.com/Simple-chained-combobox-plugin-for-jQuery/ that the input in the dropdown boxes came from my mysql database?because with this i have to add more than 200 things in the file =/
[09:17:11] <initself> Latiwa: try your best!
[09:17:29] <skylamer`> hey, how i can cache some JSON for a minutes, then retrieve it ?
[09:17:34] <ag4ve> ajpiano: nope, thanks
[09:17:35] <JAAulde> mekwall: ping
[09:18:02] <initself> skylamer`: store it serverside?
[09:18:22] <pif> hi, how can I jquery'fy event.target?
[09:19:23] <Latiwa> how can i change this script http://codeassembly.com/Simple-chained-combobox-plugin-for-jQuery/ that the inputs in the dropdown boxes come from my mysql database?
[09:20:08] <artiintell> nobody can help me?
[09:20:29] <artiintell> or there is someone who is able to answer my request?
[09:20:44] <initself> Latiwa: have you considered using JSON?
[09:21:20] <Latiwa> what?
[09:21:24] <initself> Latiwa: Write a script on the backend (in PHP or Ruby or Perl or whatever) that connects to your database and then returns JSON to your jQuery object.
[09:21:41] <Eviltwin> artiintell: We don't claim to be experts on all of the plugins
[09:21:51] <Eviltwin> I'm not familiar with the one you mentioned
[09:22:16] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/jFEEg/ # my selector in getCSVData() is all the .tablesorter tables on my page.
[09:22:30] <Eviltwin> Latiwa: They show an example PHP script there where they're adding static results
[09:22:37] <initself> How can I pass a paramter to getCSVData that specifies only the table in question?
[09:22:50] <Eviltwin> You want to do the same with the data from your MySQL
[09:22:55] <initself> I need to specify the table that I .insertbefore on
[09:23:31] <Eviltwin> onclick="getCSVData"
[09:23:35] <Eviltwin> Then $(this)
[09:23:43] <Eviltwin> Well
[09:23:48] <Eviltwin> Not quite
[09:24:50] <initself> don't i need to identify WHICH table I am inserting before?
[09:25:00] <initself> And pass that as a parameter to getCSVData?
[09:25:04] <Eviltwin> There are a couple options
[09:26:10] <D4> I'm trying to use .length to determine if something is empty and I'm "emptying" by using .remove on .post, but the value of .length isn't being updated so the check fails, however if I reload the page it checks outside .post() and there it's "ok", but above .post. How do I update .length within post to hold the actual information ? I'm removing, so it should be 0 but console.log shows 1 (still).
[09:26:15] <D4> Sweet, that made sense..
[09:26:31] <Latiwa> can someone help me with 2 scripts?in german^^
[09:27:14] <JAAulde> mekwall: when you get a sec, I was looking at https://github.com/mekwall/jquery-ui-notification based on a recommendation. your demo site (linked from that page) seems to be down. Also, do you expect this to work well with jQ 1.7.1 and UI 1.8.18, or is that something you haven't looked into yet?
[09:28:12] <f4stra> anyone know if the page source of the a google results page gives you the URLs of the ten results it gives you? ctrl+f then typing their addresses doesnt
[09:28:48] <JAAulde> mekwall: also, in your repo, both jquery.ui.notification.js and jquery.ui.notification.min.js are minified
[09:29:06] <initself> Eviltwin: did Goodtwin capture you?
[09:29:13] <Eviltwin> initself: Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jFEEg/1/
[09:30:14] <Eviltwin> Also keep in mind that you should only have an ID once in the page
[09:30:21] <Eviltwin> So I'd remove that id="csv_text"
[09:30:40] <Eviltwin> Oh and you're not using the onclick="getCSVData()" any more
[09:30:59] <Eviltwin> This also wasn't a working example
[09:31:10] <Eviltwin> Which is what we're looking for with jsFiddle
[09:31:22] <D4> I'm doing .remove within .post and then counting using .length. Problem is even though .remove was executed before checking the length, it still has the old value before the removal, anyone able to tell me how to go around this?
[09:31:23] <initself> Eviltwin: isn't onclick="getCSVData()" out of the picture with your code?
[09:31:40] <Eviltwin> Yes
[09:31:59] <initself> i am just going to remove it
[09:32:03] <ajpiano> D4: .remove() doesn't remove elements from a given set, it removes them from DOM
[09:32:07] <Eviltwin> Yes
[09:32:37] <ajpiano> D4: var foo = $(".foo");  foo.length == 4; foo.remove();  foo.length == 4;
[09:32:44] <Eviltwin> You want .not() to construct a set without those elements
[09:32:50] <D4> Ah, manually setting the length after?
[09:33:05] <ajpiano> no
[09:33:07] <ajpiano> i'm saying
[09:33:11] <ajpiano> that afterward, the length is still the same
[09:33:15] <ajpiano> that's expected behaviour
[09:33:25] <Latiwa> http://www.codespuds.com/chained-select-boxes-using-php-mysql-ajax/ is this script posting something in my mysql or did it ready some things?
[09:33:26] <D4> yeah, sorry - that's what I'm experiencing, so that's right - how'd I solve it?
[09:33:39] <ajpiano> D4: query the dom again?
[09:35:32] <D4> ajpiano » Thing is, outside my $(document).on(.... I'm still in $(dociment).ready(..., the removal is done within the .on and then within .post. When I remove the last of something, I'd like to check if empty, if it is.. fadeOut() a specific element
[09:35:54] <ajpiano> $("#foo").is(":empty") ?
[09:36:32] <D4> ajpiano » When will :empty be true? As in, if I'm checking like this right now: $('.parts_list .list table tbody tr').length
[09:36:49] <ajpiano> ?tias
[09:36:50] <bot-t> Try It And See
[09:37:00] <nFFF> whats wrong with checking the length?
[09:37:20] <D4> What ajpiano told me earlier, it's expected to be 1 even though I'm expecting it to be 0
[09:37:34] <ajpiano> a new query should produce a length of 0
[09:37:44] <ajpiano> but referring to the cached set would get its length
[09:37:54] <ajpiano> D4: the point is, all you've done is describe your poblem using sentences
[09:38:01] <ajpiano> if you want an authoritative diagnosis, see ?demo
[09:38:02] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:41:35] <initself> don't know if this is too little info....
[09:41:49] <Eviltwin> If you're asking that question...
[09:41:50] <initself> var orgOrderCol = cache.normalized[0].length - 1; // 'normalized.0.length' is null or not an object
[09:42:15] <initself> now this doesn't seem to outright break my page, but is there an obvious fix?
[09:42:25] <initself> or do you need to know what cache is?
[09:42:29] <Eviltwin> That was too little information
[09:42:32] <initself> ya....

[09:46:56] <One-Man-Bucket> hi
[09:47:11] <One-Man-Bucket> we need to get jquery-ui sortable to accept elements from a native drag and drop event
[09:47:17] <One-Man-Bucket> anyone know if this has been done before?
[09:47:53] <Eviltwin> One-Man-Bucket: So not draggable/droppable through jQuery UI?
[09:48:23] <ajpiano> One-Man-Bucket: reasonably confident that that isn't going to end in success for ya
[09:48:25] <ajpiano> hate to say it
[09:51:37] <One-Man-Bucket> we have a "kinda working" hack
[09:51:51] <initself> Eviltwin: any flippin idea why only IE reports that error but not Firebug?
[09:52:09] <Eviltwin> Try Firebug Lite in IE
[09:52:18] <One-Man-Bucket> which is a shame, since now there's no way for us to pull the functionality or demand that we get time to remove frames from our app
[09:52:28] <One-Man-Bucket> "it already works, kinda. just fix it"
[09:52:49] <Eviltwin> Sounds like you're pretty screwed then
[09:53:12] <ajpiano> One-Man-Bucket: management giving you the ol' "you've already given us a horse, now just strap on a horn and give us a unicorn" routine?
[09:53:27] <D4> ajpiano » I'm failing to build a test case, would a nopaste help? I was thinking of doing a new, what you call a query, but I don't know what that means. Or if you've got a spare min I could PM a live url and simply show you?
[09:53:57] <initself> jesus firebug bookmark WORK!
[09:54:36] <One-Man-Bucket> our approach was to catch the dragenter event in the target frame and manually trigger mousemove on dragover, mouseup on dragend and mousedown on dragenter
[09:54:55] <One-Man-Bucket> trigger these on a jquery-ui draggable that's connected to a couple of sortables
[09:56:15] <initself> Eviltwin: ok, I installed it. no error shows up.  and there's no longer a "Error on the Page" exclamation.
[09:56:20] <initself> any ideas?
[09:56:38] <initself> ah, now there is
[09:56:47] <ajpiano> D4: send me the link, i'll take a quick look but might have to run in like 4 minutes
[09:56:51] <initself> it only happens when there are no JSON records to process.
[09:57:05] <initself> but Firebug doesn't seem to care, just IE.
[09:58:15] <initself> cache.normalized[pos[0]][pos[1]] = config.parsers[pos[1]].format(
[09:58:25] <initself> Ok, if config doesn't print in console.log....
[09:58:32] <initself> does that mean it is empty?
[09:58:34] <ccmonster> hey, what's the best way to pre-set a link's value that I'm doing image replacement on? I have 5 buttons that I want to pass a unique value from to an ajax function
[09:58:46] <initself> or that it isn't getting to this point in the code?
[09:59:14] <initself> there's the bug
[09:59:18] <initself> i see now!
[09:59:31] <One-Man-Bucket> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1704324/frames/frameset.html

[10:02:29] <LukeNukem> http://notey.it/n/Mjg
[10:02:40] <LukeNukem> i have mentioned the issue in comments in the bottom of the paste..i cant make a live test
[10:03:01] <skyer2000> what is the best way to switch between a normal website and a jquery mobile version?
[10:03:04] <LukeNukem> i can put an alert inside the if statement and a body.append that works but the status_controls_...thingie does not
[10:03:18] <LukeNukem> skyer2000, what exactly do you mean?
[10:03:20] <skyer2000> i usually just switch out stylesheets, but the extra functionality would be great without creating a completely different mobile site
[10:03:32] <rabbi1> how can i create a multicolumn sub menu while the number of submenu's are dynamic ?
[10:05:29] <oojacoboo> how can I simply validate a floating point integer?
[10:05:52] <oojacoboo> parseFloat() ?
[10:06:26] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquery: Announcing the jQuery Foundation - http://t.co/htqtPS1D â˜… http://bit.ly/yc2HJy
[10:08:05] <techouse> can i do somethins like this
[10:08:16] <techouse> $(this).style.display = 'none';
[10:08:43] <oojacoboo> techouse: $(this).hide();
[10:08:47] <techouse> or do o have to go like $(this).attr('style':'display:none');
[10:09:16] <techouse> oojacoboo yea, that works wverywhere, except ie7/8 is giving me some trouble
[10:09:26] <techouse> so i'm writing my own animate
[10:09:30] <oojacoboo> sounds like another issue
[10:09:40] <Majicpanda> .toggle() is a good function as well
[10:09:44] <oojacoboo> you can use style(display, none)
[10:10:07] <techouse> yea, but can i use the js object.style.display on a jquery object?
[10:10:16] <techouse> that's what i wanna know
[10:10:18] <oojacoboo> techouse: sure
[10:10:22] <techouse> oky :)
[10:10:56] <skyer2000> no ideas on switching between a desktop / jquery mobile site? any methods like switching stylesheets?
[10:11:29] <oojacoboo> skyer2000: use a diff url
[10:11:34] <oojacoboo> or domain even
[10:11:39] <skyer2000> and a different site?
[10:11:45] <oojacoboo> no, domain
[10:11:51] <oojacoboo> akaâ€¦ m.mydomain.com
[10:11:53] <oojacoboo> for mobile
[10:15:59] <skyer2000> oojacoboo, do you then do a conditional at the beginning of the page to check for the domain and load necessary scripts?
[10:16:07] <skyer2000> it seems like 2 different sites will need to be maintained
[10:16:20] <initself> Eviltwin: Ok, dude, I debugged a big ass plugin I know nothing about and got rid of errors and kept the functionality I know about, at least.
[10:16:57] <initself> So now I am back to your suggestions that you gave me.  Everything cosmetically looks great, I just have to rows in my exported tsv..

[10:18:48] <skyer2000> oojacoboo is there a library you use to check the UA?

[10:19:32] <Craig2048> hi all.  in response to the user clicking a selection in an option/listbox, how can i get a count of the number of selected items?  (note that clicking does not always mean it will be one)
[10:19:47] <techouse> can i target a displayed div by simply doing $('div[style="display:block;"]').blabla?
[10:19:57] <Craig2048> seems i need to combine the this with :selected but i don't know the syntax.
[10:23:15] <Craig2048> i would have thought it would be: $this.css(':selected').length
[10:23:18] <Craig2048> but that doesn't seem to work
[10:23:56] <ag4ve> is there any difference between doing i.val(''); or i.replaceWith('');?
[10:25:22] <erichynds> Craig2048: $(this).find(":selected").length
[10:26:34] <Craig2048> erichynds: perfect!  thanks a bunch!
[10:28:23] <Emn1ty> can someone else test this patch and see if it works? It keeps breaking for me: http://code.google.com/p/flot/issues/attachmentText?id=282&aid=5754939623986415417&name=flot.draggable.r229.patch&token=735f2af75a89ebf5291c9eb25ce55eb3

[10:29:03] <LukeNukem> quick doubt
[10:29:16] <LukeNukem> say i have a div element, like so <div id='test'> </div>
[10:29:26] <LukeNukem> append puts whatever inside the quotes inside the div tags right?
[10:29:44] <Emn1ty> yes
[10:30:32] <Emn1ty> $('#test').append('<p>foo</p>')

[10:32:56] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all. I would like all of my "a.nav" elements to be handled by a single handler function. What is the best way to approach this? A plugin class or delegate or...? any advice?
[10:33:45] <someprimetime> is the best way to get a count of all the form tags within a class of $('.grid_9 form').each(function(index) { console.log(index); }); ?
[10:34:06] <Whirl3d> $(".grid_9 form").length
[10:34:07] <hashpuppy> what's wrong with .length?
[10:34:26] <Emn1ty> initself: might it have to do with the fact there is nothing with the class tablesorter?
[10:35:08] <initself> <table class="tablesorter" style="width: 300px">  ?
[10:35:19] <Emn1ty> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'each' of null
[10:35:21] <initself> first line
[10:35:29] <initself> Emn1ty: where the heck do you see that?
[10:35:37] <Emn1ty> console
[10:35:50] <initself> Emn1ty++
[10:36:08] <initself> i dont understand why, since that is the class of my table.
[10:36:10] <someprimetime> Whirl3d and hashpuppy yeah that works
[10:36:11] <someprimetime> thanks
[10:36:20] <someprimetime> thought for some reason i'd have to traverse through them all first
[10:36:48] <initself> it would help if i turn on jQuery
[10:36:49] <initself> initself--
[10:36:58] <initself> WHY IS MOOTOOLS THE DEFAULT
[10:37:01] <Emn1ty> lol
[10:37:17] <hashpuppy> someprimetime: would be the case if it returned an iterator, but it returns an array
[10:37:51] <someprimetime> hashpuppy: does javascript's native length method traverse them or something? where is that value tied to (internally)?
[10:37:51] <initself> ok, check it
[10:37:51] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/ner8r/6/
[10:38:01] <initself> console.log('here') doesn't print
[10:38:05] <someprimetime> aka how does .length work in this case
[10:38:09] <Whirl3d> is this acceptible js?   [pageRef, topicRef]=href.split("-");
[10:38:09] <initself> does that mean the "click" function isn't binding?
[10:39:04] <erichynds> Whirl3d: no, unfortunately
[10:39:43] <hashpuppy> someprimetime: i don't know the implementation details, because it's up to each browser.  but, i assume they just increment length when elements get added/removed
[10:39:52] <someprimetime> hashpuppy: interesting thanks
[10:40:05] <Whirl3d> erichynds, thanks for the reply. is it better to cache the split results and assign the pieces afterwards or does it matter to split it twice
[10:40:09] <Emn1ty> initself: does .find() look for elements based on css syntax?
[10:40:24] <erichynds> Whirl3d: prolly just split it once so you're not repeating yourself
[10:40:39] <Whirl3d> great. Thanks for the help.
[10:40:51] <Emn1ty> initself: or does it check to see if the element has any attributes with that value?
[10:41:22] <KevlarSoul> Am I wrong or would this be perfect for mobile web design? http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/?transition=page
[10:41:38] <mattyh88> hey i'm getting a 'uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined' error. jquery file is loaded
[10:42:04] <mattyh88> https://gist.github.com/50f456de29c80020226f
[10:42:35] <erichynds> mattyh88: does it work if you use the word "jQuery" in place of $ ?
[10:43:00] <mattyh88> erichynds: no
[10:43:11] <erichynds> you probably haven't loaded jquery correctly then
[10:43:34] <erichynds> or you have another piece of code that calls jQuery.noConflict(true), but the former is more likely
[10:43:53] <Emn1ty> mattyh88: http://jsfiddle.net/6HFPz/ - works fine
[10:43:55] <erichynds> check yo net panel in firebug or webkit inspector
[10:45:01] <mattyh88> Emn1ty: yes .. but some how it's not loading the jquery. In my chrome dev bar, it says the jquery file is loaded correctly
[10:45:11] <Emn1ty> check console
[10:45:36] <mattyh88> it says "Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined"
[10:45:50] <Emn1ty> then jQuery is not defined.
[10:45:56] <Emn1ty> do you have a link?
[10:46:02] <mattyh88> site isn't online
[10:46:03] <erichynds> are you trying to use jQuery before it's been loaded?
[10:46:22] <mattyh88> don't think so
[10:46:24] <erichynds> and check for a plugin or something calling noConflict(true)
[10:48:54] <mattyh88> ah wait, i actually was trying to use jquery before it was loaded ..
[10:49:03] <mattyh88> always used to defined the script tag at the bottom of the body page
[10:49:07] <mattyh88> *define
[10:49:12] <mattyh88> *body tag
[10:52:43] <KevlarSoul> wow just found this: http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[10:53:31] <Craig2048> is there a way to search up the dom in a way that includes siblings or does it just do descendants?
[10:53:43] <Craig2048> err descendants = parents, i guess
[10:54:21] <erichynds> not with one method, not
[10:54:22] <erichynds> no*
[10:54:54] <Jon47> ancestors ;)
[10:54:55] <Craig2048> i guess i just need to get the parent and then search for immediate siblings, going up.
[10:55:10] <Jon47> .parent().siblings()
[10:55:28] * Craig2048 tries that...
[10:55:36] <erichynds> or go to some far top-level element once, then find()
[10:57:29] <Craig2048> thx both.  i think parent().siblings('.my-class') did the trick.
[11:03:46] <Whirl3d> if you clone an element that you select by id, the clone doesn't copy the id attribute, does it?
[11:04:23] <raj> .find() looks within nested elements?
[11:04:29] <raj> or the length of the page?
[11:04:38] <raj> length of the html
[11:04:53] <Eviltwin> ?find @ raj
[11:05:06] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: It does copy the ID
[11:05:10] <initself> Emn1ty: parity error crash, ugh
[11:05:12] <Eviltwin> raj: http://api.jquery.com/find/
[11:05:20] <raj> you're your own bot
[11:05:22] <raj> awesome :)
[11:05:55] <raj> so descendants, ok great
[11:06:02] <bot-t> raj, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[11:06:03] <raj> then how can I get to the lowest decendent?
[11:06:11] <raj> someone cheated
[11:06:12] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, other than on some peculiar semantic level, what is the logic behind having an element with a duplicate id?
[11:06:47] <raj> like the very last .find('ul')
[11:07:01] <raj> i mean, the very deepest
[11:07:30] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: A clone should be a clone
[11:07:38] <Eviltwin> And clones have all the same attributes
[11:07:41] <Eviltwin> And IDs are attributes
[11:07:50] <Eviltwin> Therefore a clone will have the same ID
[11:08:00] <nights> hi
[11:08:17] <nights> how do i set the data to be returned so that i can use it in my success function?
[11:08:20] <nights> for .ajax()
[11:08:22] <Eviltwin> When a clone is made, it's actually made ina a document fragment
[11:08:31] <Eviltwin> A separate document
[11:08:44] <Whirl3d> Oh, that's what I couldn't figure out...
[11:08:50] <Eviltwin> So it's not a violation of the unique ID per document requirement
[11:09:07] <Eviltwin> If you immediately put it in the current document then it is
[11:09:33] <Whirl3d> perfect.  Thanks, as always for your help
[11:11:55] <raj> how can I get the very deepest .find('ul') so I can collect each li within it?
[11:12:11] <raj> .find('ul:last') ?
[11:13:01] <Whirl3d> so if I clone an element, remove it's ID attribute, then call load using the pagefragment syntax, can I still use the complete callback handler? The api doesn't say if it is available for page fragment loading.
[11:16:34] <paissad> guys, i'm trying to have this selectmenu http://filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_ui_selectmenu_an_aria_accessible_plugin_for_styling_a_html_select/,  but i'm blocked
[11:16:56] <paissad> here is what i did ----> $('#id').selectmenu();
[11:17:17] <paissad> where #id is the id of the <select></select> i want to customize
[11:17:23] <Whirl3d> and one last thing about loading page fragments: I want to load a fragment with a given id into a div...will the newly loaded fragment still have it's id or can I assign the id to container I am loading into...
[11:17:38] <Whirl3d> sorry, but .load behaviors are hard to tias...
[11:20:07] <jsumners> I'm working on a application that relies on every AJAX request being a CORS request. When I send a POST, jQuery does the CORS request as expected. But when I send a GET, jQuery isn't sending any CORS headers at all. How can I force a GET to send the correct headers?

[11:34:09] <LukeNukem> anyone?
[11:34:25] <LukeNukem> nvm
[11:34:26] <jason_stoudt> LukeNukem: the same way you do it with any other element
[11:36:29] <IamTrying> Is there any open/free same/alternative this? http://codiqa.com/
[11:38:37] <eddiemonge> IamTrying: they have a free plan. but i find it best to just write the code myself
[11:39:16] <IamTrying> eddiemonge, write less get more. Drag and drop :)
[11:40:00] <eddiemonge> IamTrying: http://jquerymobile.com/
[11:41:10] <IamTrying> Does this has all jQuery 1.7.1 functions? specially the $.ajax and basic stuffs? e.g: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/02/28/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-1-0-rc1/
[11:41:35] <eddiemonge> IamTrying: yes, if you use jquery 1.7.1
[11:43:41] <IamTrying> OK - thanks
[11:45:48] <IamTrying> Where to get those templates for jQuery? http://www.crestron.com/products/apple_mac_iphone_ipod_ipad_control/ipad_control_custom_gui_gallery.asp
[11:46:20] <Eviltwin> Wlere to get some random company's templates for jQuery?
[11:46:28] <IamTrying> I am tired with crestron/extron. Need something in jQuery drag n drop (write less get more).
[11:46:53] <jsumners> IamTrying, you're not trying very hard
[11:47:07] <Eviltwin> You actually need to do some work every once in a while
[11:47:31] <jedimind> Eviltwin, who told you that ?
[11:48:24] <Eviltwin> No one told me that, I'm telling him.
[11:49:02] <IamTrying> Well front of me and behind me two crestron/extron developers build in 5 minutes. And iWithJQueryTake 2 hours by muscle hand code writing.
[11:49:12] <IamTrying> They do drag and drop "write less ge more"
[11:49:33] <Eviltwin> So use them then?
[11:49:41] <Eviltwin> Obviously it's the library, not the dev
[11:49:58] <Woet> the dev is a lie
[11:50:01] <blindMoe> hehe
[11:50:21] <eddiemonge> IamTrying: and most drag and drop interfaces produce some pretty crappy code
[11:50:51] <Woet> eddiemonge: that doesn't matter, time is most important!
[11:51:29] <ag4ve> how do i get out of a for loop without returning? i've tried last and next and both seem to terminate the closure i'm inside
[11:51:36] <Eviltwin> break
[11:51:38] <IamTrying> eddiemonge, my boss is liking more other developers who write faster. not my muscle handed coding
[11:51:56] <ajpiano> ag4ve: break;
[11:52:12] <eddiemonge> Woet: yeah i hate places like that
[11:52:17] <Eviltwin> JavaScript has break and continue, not next or last
[11:52:20] <Eviltwin> This isn't Perl
[11:52:30] <eddiemonge> IamTrying: then your boss is an idiot
[11:52:40] <IamTrying> eddiemonge, yes. 5min vs 2 hour is huge
[11:52:57] <ag4ve> ajpiano: works, thanks (again)
[11:53:06] <eddiemonge> but which is more maintainable, more compliant, more browser friendly, more performant?
[11:53:09] <Eviltwin> IamTrying: Maybe you need to write more reusable code
[11:53:19] <Eviltwin> So that you're not spending 2 hours on every UI
[11:53:26] <Eviltwin> Maybe 4 hours the first time and much less after that
[11:53:46] <eddiemonge> if you are just doing static content with super simple designs, then yeah just do whatever is fastest
[11:53:55] <IamTrying> Crestron/Extron has a Gui builder. Where you can drag things and Gui is ready. Connect them to home/car door/automation in 10 minutes your home is automaetd.
[11:53:56] <[jasper]> hej guys, anyone in here using datatables...maybe someone can tell me how to make the table a certain width and height?
[11:54:03] <eddiemonge> but if you want to make something that actually has meat to it, you are probably going to need more
[11:54:19] <IamTrying> IjQueryTake 2 hours in Gui, and then cabling/wiring take 2 days to impress now others.
[11:54:25] <Borad> I wanna know how to make scroll event like this http://solidpink.com.au/
[11:54:41] <jsumners> IamTrying, so buy their product
[11:54:53] <IamTrying> jsumners, i am doing 5 years and now tired.
[11:55:09] <Borad> anyone can tell me how to make something like this http://solidpink.com.au/ ?
[11:55:23] <Whirl3d> when I do $("<div/>").load("/somedir/index.html #intro",function (data) {console.log(data);}); I'm getting the entire index.html document rather than just the #intro fragment...any ideas why?
[11:55:39] <eddiemonge> Borad: that is annoying. and please dont spam. ask your question, wait a bit and if no answer then you can ask again. like once every 10 minutes
[11:55:49] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: but does it insert the right data into the element?
[11:56:10] <Borad> <eddiemonge> ok sorry
[11:56:11] <Whirl3d> no
[11:56:21] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, it discards all of it
[11:56:30] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, thanks for the reply, btw
[11:56:34] <arnpro> what's the best way to an element, from a div, to another??? like element.clone(), then div2.append() then div1.empty() or hows better?
[11:56:41] <ajpiano> it *discards* all of it? so nothing gets inserted?
[11:56:52] <ajpiano> arnpro: appendTo() etc will move an element
[11:57:01] <ajpiano> $("#foo").appendTo("#bar") will move foo, not copy it
[11:57:03] <Whirl3d> http://paigeharvey.net/admin/temp/home.html
[11:57:06] <ajpiano> (unless there are multiple destinations)
[11:57:16] <ajpiano> arnpro: so you just can use append directly
[11:57:19] <eddiemonge> arnpro: think you left off a word there
[11:57:25] <arnpro> thanks ajpiano
[11:57:32] <arnpro> what you mean eddiemonge
[11:57:33] <eddiemonge> Borad: and look at the source code for that sie
[11:57:35] <eddiemonge> site
[11:57:42] <eddiemonge> arnpro: reread your question
[11:58:01] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: what do i click on
[11:58:01] <IamTrying> Never mind. I thought there was something of jQuery "write more lesser and get mucher with our new drag n drop - generation"
[11:58:14] <Whirl3d> sorry, click on Gallery
[11:58:37] <arnpro> eddiemonge: you're right, hehehe, but our brains make it work... ajpiano understood it :p hehe
[11:58:39] <eddiemonge> IamTrying: those arent jquery. those are 3rd party companies
[11:59:06] <IamTrying> Yea sadly its true. thanks a lot. Have fun.
[11:59:37] <eddiemonge> well that was just odd
[11:59:49] <Borad> eddiemong , i inspect elemnts but i couldnt get it
[11:59:49] <jsumners> That's one word for it
[12:00:24] <Borad> eddiemong ,whats the event that trigger scroll move and return numbers to control background positions
[12:00:25] <Borad> ?
[12:00:53] <jason_stoudt> Borad: there's no special functionality about the scrolling on this page
[12:01:10] <eddiemonge> Borad: look at the source. you probably want to look at the novo slider or whatever that is
[12:01:37] <arnpro> ajpiano: is there something similar like appendTo() to "put it before X element", like prepend
[12:02:09] <eddiemonge> ?prepend @ arnpro
[12:02:09] <bot-t> arnpro, .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[12:02:17] <eddiemonge> prependto @ arnpro
[12:02:21] <eddiemonge> ? prependto @ arnpro
[12:02:21] <bot-t> arnpro, .prependTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the beginning of the target. http://api.jquery.com/prependTo/
[12:02:34] <arnpro> awesome
[12:03:24] <Eviltwin> Borad: Have you seen this? http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrollorama/
[12:04:00] <RandalSchwartz> yeay - http://blog.jquery.com/2012/03/06/announcing-the-jquery-foundation/
[12:04:24] <Borad> <Eviltwin> wow you rocks man
[12:04:30] <Borad> thks so much
[12:04:38] <Eviltwin> Borad: It took me a bit to track that back down
[12:04:45] <Eviltwin> But it sounded like what you were looing for
[12:04:47] <Eviltwin> looking*
[12:04:57] <Borad> yeah exactly
[12:05:07] <Borad> ++Eviltwin
[12:06:07] <someprimetime> how can i add an event listener to have it be reset within a loop?
[12:06:53] <someprimetime> basically i'm looping through a filelist object and am uploading each file within it.. i'm adding a progress eventListener but it's calculating progress for all files, and not each individual one
[12:08:06] <solidus-river> what plugin does jquery use to filter dom elements?
[12:08:13] <solidus-river> i know it uses another open source project but i forget which one
[12:08:31] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, if you are looking at my issue, I just solved it. I was identifying the wrong fragment in the url
[12:08:42] <ajpiano> solidus-river: Sizzle. it's not a "plugin" and it was originally part of jQuery until it was extracted into a standalone selector lib that jquery uses
[12:08:46] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: i had a feeling
[12:08:50] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: sorry i got distracted lol
[12:11:40] <theshanergy> I've got a riddle for someone. I'm currently using :gt(2) to grab every element except for the first two within a div. How would I go about grabbing every element except for the *last* two instead?
[12:13:40] <ajpiano> theshanergy: var foo = div.find(".foo");  foo.slice( 0, foo.length -2 );
[12:14:05] <Eviltwin> ":not(:last):not(:last)" :P
[12:15:08] <theshanergy> ajpiano: foo, being the parent div?
[12:15:12] <ajpiano> yep
[12:15:23] <ajpiano> being your jquery reference to it
[12:15:27] <ajpiano> so however you want to get the collection
[12:15:37] <ajpiano> do collection.slice( 0, collection.length - 2 )
[12:15:51] <Woet> does someone know a jquery plugin for nice and clean lists with folders and possible sub folders? like http://jquerylist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/codeExplorer.png on the left
[12:15:53] <ajpiano> that probably works a lot faster for doing the :gt(2)  as well, if you care :)
[12:16:31] <theshanergy> so, the slice is going to return the two elements and I can just do whatever to them (in this case .hide())
[12:16:47] <eddiemonge> Woet: seems jsTree is pretty popular. cant say if its good or not though
[12:17:24] <eddiemonge> ?lt
[12:17:25] <bot-t> :lt(index): Select all elements at an index less than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/lt-selector/
[12:17:36] <Eviltwin> I've used jsTree before and it has suited my needs without too much trouble
[12:18:00] <eddiemonge> but i guess you would need to know how many elements for lt
[12:18:10] <eddiemonge> or does it take negative numbers?
[12:18:25] <Eviltwin> I don't think it does
[12:18:42] <Eviltwin> Although .slice does actually
[12:18:46] <eddiemonge> yeah i was checking the source now to see if it does
[12:19:04] <Eviltwin> $(".foo").slice(0, -2);
[12:22:42] <eddiemonge> i sometimes forget that jQ collections are array-like
[12:23:17] <theshanergy> I can't figure this slice thing out
[12:23:18] <theshanergy> code here: http://jsfiddle.net/2havj/
[12:23:35] <theshanergy> basically I want to create var hiddenElements, and hide them all
[12:23:44] <theshanergy> then toggle them at will
[12:23:53] <eddiemonge> theshanergy: .length instead of .size()
[12:25:42] <theshanergy> changed it to length, though that's just for my return if it doesn't have enough elements to hide
[12:25:56] <theshanergy> this line: var hiddenElements = rowElements.slice( 0, hiddenElements.length - 2 ).hide();
[12:25:58] <theshanergy> isn't working
[12:26:13] <theshanergy> bah, rowelements
[12:26:17] <theshanergy> I think I see the issue
[12:27:09] <eddiemonge> theshanergy: with the exception of a few small changes, it seems fine
[12:27:24] <theshanergy> still isn't working..
[12:28:30] <Whirl3d> so, i hear that it's a good idea to use .css to tranform your content into a format that is compatible with the device you are using. So, is there a way to do that with jqMobile or do I still have to do a seperate mobile site?
[12:33:58] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: you mean CSS and not .css()? like with media queries?
[12:34:16] <eddiemonge> if so, then yes
[12:34:45] <Whirl3d> lol, sorry. I meant CSS, thx. And how?
[12:34:46] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: it really depends on your strategy. you can have a separate site if you want or you can make the existing site responsive
[12:35:08] <ag4ve> why isn't my appendTo working here? http://paste.scsys.co.uk/185402
[12:35:16] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: take a look at http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrolldeck.js/decks/responsive/
[12:35:21] <ag4ve> ... working == appending option to select
[12:35:24] <Whirl3d> I'm strarting from scratch and want to build it so that it is compatible for any device without having to do UA checks
[12:35:34] <ag4ve> ... ie, innerHTML (iirc)
[12:35:46] <eddiemonge> ag4ve: you want append, not appendTo
[12:35:56] <Whirl3d> *starting
[12:36:02] <eddiemonge> your options should go into the select, not the other way around
[12:36:33] <Jon47> Whirl3d the prevailing strategy these days is feature detection rather than browser sniffing, so you detect what features your client's browser supports, and deliver them an experience based on that - the window size of the browser or device can be thought of as a "feature"
[12:36:54] <Jon47> you can use this to decide how the content should appear, what size images to download, etc..
[12:37:07] <ag4ve> eddiemonge: yup, works :)
[12:38:14] <Whirl3d> fyi, the link you provided doesn't work too great for my system: I am running Chrome (latest build) on Windows 7 on a 37" monitor...it doesn't cook up right at all.
[12:38:47] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: really? you should fork it and fix it
[12:38:53] <eddiemonge> what doesnt work on it?
[12:39:21] <Whirl3d> 3/4 of the pages are cut off . The text for the headlines when animating, jump lines an wrap wildly
[12:39:46] <Whirl3d> it looks about like jqmobile does on my desktop browser...
[12:40:14] <JAAulde> Are any UI folks in here familiar with the progrssion of UI's tooltip (1.9)
[12:40:15] <JAAulde> ?
[12:40:27] <ajpiano> JAAulde: what about the progression of it
[12:41:44] <JAAulde> ajpiano: I had ported a version back for use in 1.8 and it worked.  I have upgraded to jQ 1.7.1 and UI 1.8.18 and as a part of that upgrade and updating plugins. So I went back to http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138112/Tooltip and extracted the newest version fo the code, but get an error for ._bind() not being defined
[12:41:59] <Blaker0111> Hi. Can you have an HTML page that has multiple calls to $j = jQuery.noConflict(); and $j(document).read(); ? Example code: https://gist.github.com/1988844
[12:42:03] <ajpiano> ._bind is a 1.9 widget factory method
[12:42:19] <JAAulde> so I just wondered what the ins and outs of the latest changes involved, and if I should bother pulling it forward
[12:42:25] <JAAulde> ajpiano: ahh, ok
[12:42:27] <JAAulde> makes sense
[12:42:40] <JAAulde> I think I can stick with the older stuff I have for this setup
[12:42:44] <JAAulde> seems to be working
[12:43:02] <eddiemonge> Blaker0111: the multiple .ready() blocks yes
[12:43:35] <eddiemonge> Blaker0111: and you can for the noconflict, but you generally use that with multiple jquery versions or to change the $ to something else so another library doesnt steal it
[12:44:09] <JAAulde> I'm def looking forward to 1.9!
[12:44:38] <eddiemonge> im looking forward to 2.0
[12:44:51] <JAAulde> overrated
[12:44:54] <eddiemonge> when everything is all nice and shiny and consistent and clean
[12:45:01] <bitwise_> anyone using specit? im getting uncaught exception when using beA, beAn matchers- complains to use Qunit.equal instead of Qunit.equals
[12:45:24] <Blaker0111> eddiemonge: Thanks for that info. I am experiencing some really odd results, so maybe the jquery plugin im using (in the spot of Object from the example code) throwing up. Thanks eddie.
[12:46:15] <Krenair> What method returned by jQuery('#example') could I use to remove the content of the element (set it to '')?
[12:46:35] <bitwise_> Krenair: empty
[12:48:14] <Krenair> bitwise_, perfect, thank you!
[12:50:00] <eddiemonge> i wonder what the perf/memory difference is in using .empty() vs .html("")
[12:50:36] <gehsekky> does .html() deal with unbinding stuff?
[12:50:40] <gehsekky> or does that even matter
[12:51:46] <eddiemonge> if you remove an element completely, browsers are supposed to remove their bindings and things but im not sure they always do
[12:53:04] <gehsekky> yea, that's also what i figured. i've started to use .empty() though instead of just blind .html('')
[12:54:08] <mutedia> I've got a form, I was using a textinput for the search field and it worked okay but the integration with safari mobile wasn'T perfect
[12:54:16] <mutedia> I'VE since switched to an input type="search"
[12:54:43] <mutedia> but it breaks everything, my ajax form won't work in safari.. in chrome it works but after a few seconds it just reloads the page
[12:54:50] <mutedia> after retrieving the results
[12:55:32] <gehsekky> is search an option for input type?
[12:55:39] <mutedia> yeah
[12:55:47] <gehsekky> mind = blown
[12:55:59] <mutedia> it skins it with a little magnifying glass and an X to clear it
[12:56:07] <gehsekky> oh nice
[12:56:40] <gehsekky> mutedia: you might be better off linking a jsfiddle in here with your code
[12:57:30] <mutedia> the thing is it worked as input type="textinput"
[12:57:59] <mutedia> I guess IC ould go back and just bind a key to it
[12:59:08] <ag4ve> should html be quoted in '' or "". i've done both and i don't do any js interpolation, so either way has worked. however, i've got a file where i've used both.
[12:59:09] <mutedia> text not textinput
[12:59:20] <eddiemonge> mutedia: were your bindings/ajax dependant on the text being input="text"?
[12:59:21] <mutedia> it depends
[12:59:40] <mutedia> hmm, it's set to val
[12:59:45] <mutedia> but the thing is, in chrome it gets the results
[12:59:52] <mutedia> but 5 seconds after it reloads the page
[12:59:58] <ag4ve> "<p id='" + thing + "'>" vs '<p id "' + thing '">'
[13:00:10] <mutedia> I like '<  better
[13:00:23] <Woet> Eviltwin / eddiemonge: know any tree plugins that work with jquery ui themeroller?
[13:01:22] <mutedia> think I broke it trying to fix it, i'll be back in a short while
[13:02:01] <gehsekky> ag4ve: i like single quotes for js, but jquery standards say strings should be in double quotes iirc
[13:03:18] <eddiemonge> gehsekky: only for core code
[13:03:22] <eddiemonge> your code is up to you
[13:03:50] <ag4ve> ok, so no standrd for js, but jq double quotes strings. sounds good.
[13:03:59] <eddiemonge> ag4ve: i use double quotes unless i know im going to have strings with HTML attrs, then ill use single quotes on the outside. sometimes
[13:04:29] <eddiemonge> var str = "string";  var html = '<a href="hello.html">Hi</a>';
[13:04:40] <eddiemonge> that way html strings look more like html strings
[13:04:52] <eddiemonge> although the quotes are interchangeable so it doesnt matter much
[13:05:22] <gehsekky> ^ this
[13:05:39] <teratorn> anyone know how to programmatically close a qtip popup?
[13:07:09] <eddiemonge> gehsekky: ^ that?
[13:08:23] <gehsekky> :P
[13:08:23] <mutedia> alright, my bad
[13:08:46] <mutedia> I had e.preventDefault(); but not e.stopPropagation();
[13:10:23] <Laura_> Hi. How do I do a prototype noConflict ?
[13:10:34] <Laura_> I have lots of jquery files and a few prototype files
[13:10:44] <Laura_> id rather write the noconflict into the prototype side
[13:11:26] <mutedia> doesn'T jquery have namespaces?
[13:11:36] <mutedia> I'm not well versed but I remember reading about it
[13:26:33] <fission6> how can i have a div pulse in and out a few times?
[13:27:18] <mehale> how do I match input type select or text?
[13:27:34] <fission6> :select?
[13:28:55] <eddiemonge> mutedia: other than jQuery? no
[13:29:06] <eddiemonge> did you read about custom namespances in here?
[13:29:34] <eddiemonge> temp01: are bot-t's stats page anywhere anymore?
[13:29:46] <eddiemonge> bot-t: tell temp01 are bot-t's stats page anywhere anymore?
[13:29:47] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Okay.
[13:30:24] <mutedia> [type="text"]
[13:30:39] <eddiemonge> Laura_: prototype as in the library?
[13:31:19] <mutedia> I read this book called , Master mobiles web apps with jquery  mobile and I think there was a chapter on namespaces
[13:31:51] <mutedia> and mehale http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[13:33:16] <eddiemonge> mutedia: are you talking about event namespaces?
[13:33:35] <eddiemonge> like http://api.jquery.com/event.namespace/
[13:33:46] <mehale> mutedia: tnx
[13:35:01] <eddiemonge> fission6: animate it on a setTimeout with an optional counter
[13:35:28] <mutedia> sorry, I'm doing jquery mobile at the moment so I'm not sure what's specific to mobile and what's not
[13:36:29] <eddiemonge> mutedia: im not sure what your question it
[13:36:44] <xiam> i'm currently working on this project http://jsfoo.org, it's like a repository for plugins, do you think it's useful?
[13:37:17] <[jasper]> hej guys, anyone here that can tell me how to remove the pagination in datatables?
[13:37:37] <mutedia> hmm, laura asked a question about noConflict and I Was wondering myself if namespaces were a solution
[13:37:51] <mutedia> but it's not really a question I have since I'm not dealing with any other libraries
[13:38:51] <eddiemonge> xiam: why wouldnt you concat the scripts together?
[13:39:01] <gehsekky> i thought they already had a repository for plugins called github
[13:40:46] <eddiemonge> xiam: what is the issue its trying to solve?
[13:42:58] <xiam> eddiemonge: they're server concatenated and compressed, surely you can do it by hand but sometimes it becomes a repetitive task, that's what I'm trying to avoid.
[13:43:02] <Emn1ty> initself: glad I could help, sorry for not responding I was out of the office.
[13:43:29] <xiam> *served
[13:43:48] <LukeNukem> Hello, i notice certain websites have this feature where it says "are you sure you want to leave the page" when you are typing something into an input form
[13:44:00] <LukeNukem> and decide to leave the page..its usually shown in the browsers style
[13:44:08] <LukeNukem> but certain websites have override this
[13:44:09] <LukeNukem> how to do that?
[13:44:16] <snover> you canâ€™t â€œoverrideâ€ it.
[13:44:37] <LukeNukem> snover, how is it done?
[13:44:56] <Emn1ty> LukeNukem: there are two ways I can think of: 1) check for page unload or 2) check what the url is and redirect them to the appropriate page if its an outbound link
[13:46:39] <ezio> is there a way to have an outer div receive a click event but find out what inner div was clicked?
[13:46:40] <cilkay> Hello. I'm trying to modify the Classes menu in WYMeditor. I haven't found any useful docs on it. I'd be grateful for even an RTFM answer if you can point to useful docs.
[13:46:59] <Emn1ty> can someone attempt to use this patch and tell me if it works? http://code.google.com/p/flot/issues/detail?id=282
[13:47:28] <Emn1ty> i'm having trouble with it and i'm a nub when it comes to patching files
[13:47:43] <nFFF> ezio, sure
[13:47:51] <nFFF> check e.target in the event handler
[13:48:09] <ezio> ty
[13:48:24] <Emn1ty> ezio: is there a reason for it registering the click?
[13:48:39] <Emn1ty> nvm
[13:49:07] <ezio> i'm trying to reproduce a custom select box
[13:49:23] <mehale> how do I select form inputs type text or select? I tried $(':input[:text][:select]'); but it gets everything
[13:49:37] <eddiemonge> xiam: how is it different from including the scripts directly then?
[13:50:39] <nFFF> ezio, thats easy :D
[13:50:41] <eddiemonge> ?input @ mehale
[13:50:42] <bot-t> mehale, :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[13:50:52] <eddiemonge> ?:text @ mehale
[13:50:52] <bot-t> mehale, :text: Selects all elements of type text. http://api.jquery.com/text-selector/
[13:51:07] <eddiemonge> mehale: you should check out this page: see ? selectors
[13:51:08] <bot-t> mehale, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[13:51:14] <Emn1ty> mehale: $('input[type="text"]')
[13:51:49] <nFFF> ezio, i would use ?change() and position your custom <span> select element ontop over the select
[13:51:50] <bot-t> ezio, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[13:51:59] <fission6> any points on the coding of this snippet? http://dpaste.org/8jePy/
[13:52:40] <[jasper]> anyone here that used datatables?
[13:52:41] <ezio> nFFF, i'll look at that
[13:52:44] <ezio> ty
[13:55:25] <xiam> eddiemonge: the only difference is that you can load many scripts with a single line of code, $.foo(['ui', 'lightbox', 'sprintf']); rather than linking .js and .css files directly
[13:55:54] <fubhy> hey
[13:56:08] <fubhy> is there a way to solve this in a simpler way? http://jsfiddle.net/W5mfe/
[13:56:19] <fubhy> there is no "hasnot()" right?
[13:57:21] <blup> is there a way of getting the width/height of a div i'm appending? i keep getting 0
[13:57:29] <oojacoboo> fubhy: why do you need the has(event.target) ?
[13:57:39] <eddiemonge> fission6: var $involved = $(this) instead of line 3
[13:57:48] <eddiemonge> fission6: and chain them together
[13:58:11] <Emn1ty> blup: .clientWidth and .clientHeight should work
[13:58:15] <fubhy> oojacoboo it checks whether the click event occured inside or outside of a toggleable element and then deactivates the modal that is attached to the toggle if the click occured outside
[13:58:23] <eddiemonge> fission6: actually...   $(this).text("Apply Now!").fadeIn("slow") replaces lines 3-5
[13:58:28] <Emn1ty> blup: that gives you the visible height and width of the element.
[13:58:46] <oojacoboo> fubhy: why wouldn't you include this in that event then?
[13:58:49] <fubhy> oojacoboo so basically "does $('.toggleable') have 'event.target' as a child element"?
[13:58:53] <xiam> eddiemonge: and that's the general approach, but I have very few plugins in the repo right now.
[13:59:12] <eddiemonge> xiam: i think you should make that clearer. i didnt get that from that page. although if people are going through that much effort, a build process would still be better
[13:59:50] <fubhy> oojacoboo how would you do it?
[14:00:01] <blup> Emn1ty: thanks, i'll try that
[14:00:06] <oojacoboo> make the event a function fubhy
[14:00:10] <nFFF> xiam, so a plugin to load multiple plugins :D
[14:00:58] <fubhy> oojacoboo i dont understand what you mean i am afraid
[14:01:41] <xiam> eddiemonge: thank you
[14:01:52] <Emn1ty> blup: np, if it doesn't work just say something and I'll mess around in jsfiddle to give you a working example
[14:02:27] <eddiemonge> fubhy: whats your markup?
[14:03:35] <oojacoboo> fubhy: I'd have to see more code and the whole thing to tell you for sure, but where you're setting toggleable, why wouldn't you use that event for controlling this?
[14:04:02] <xiam> nFFF: well, I have just a few plugins but yes, that's the idea.
[14:06:13] <fubhy> oojacoboo this is the entire Drupal behavior: http://jsfiddle.net/uSJBa/
[14:06:19] <fubhy> its really simple actually and it works
[14:06:49] <fubhy> it allows me to place jquery toggleable modals, dropdowns, etc. anywhere on the site that have a switch named ".toggle" somewhere
[14:07:07] <fubhy> and whenever the .toggle switch is pressed, the parent ".toggleable" element becomes ".toggled"
[14:07:33] <fubhy> so its really straight forward... only that this whole .has.not ... seems not 100% optimized
[14:08:13] <oojacoboo> it's just doing a sanity check to see if it's within the DOM with <body>
[14:08:16] <oojacoboo> right
[14:09:13] <oojacoboo> or the reverse rather, I don't really know, I don't understand what the purpose of the $('body).click() event is all about
[14:09:20] <fubhy> everytime you click somewhere it closes all .toggleables that are not descendants of the click event
[14:09:54] <oojacoboo> so why not do an if parent doesn't exist then?
[14:10:05] <oojacoboo> off the original targets
[14:10:08] <eddiemonge> fubhy: http://jsfiddle.net/uSJBa/2/
[14:10:14] <eddiemonge> maybe
[14:10:24] <eddiemonge> my logic might be backwards
[14:13:31] <fubhy> eddiemonge oojacoboo thanks
[14:17:18] <versatiletech> what's the word we use a lot in web development that means "repeating some unnessarily"?
[14:17:48] <oojacoboo> the opposite of a singleton
[14:17:49] <eshlox> hi, http://pastebin.com/kAREfd3f how send result from url (line 2) to .each (lin 5)?
[14:18:18] <versatiletech> not that. Keep spitting out words. :D
[14:18:34] <ajpiano> DRY
[14:19:01] <versatiletech> this word is probably more common with usability
[14:24:14] <Ariel_Calzada> hi, i'm using jquery tab with jquery datatables. In a tab i load with ajax an html that contains a datatable, but the css of datatables are not loaded any idea?
[14:24:32] <xiam> versatiletech: they say "reinventing the wheel" or "k.i.s.s." or "dry"
[14:24:55] <andrew___> Ariel_Calzada: You're not calling $("mytable").datatables()
[14:24:57] <andrew___> Or whatever.
[14:25:02] <andrew___> Not after you actually load the table.
[14:27:25] <Ariel_Calzada> andrew___: thanks i'll view
[14:27:34] <eddiemonge> versatiletech: modular?
[14:27:41] <eddiemonge> widget?
[14:27:47] <versatiletech> hmm still
[14:28:23] <versatiletech> for some reason my brain is saying the word "incongruant" is somehow related to this word
[14:28:54] <eddiemonge> eshlox: you want to get something from ajax and then loop through those results doing a new ajax request for each?
[14:29:14] <jedimind> mmmmmmmmmidget
[14:30:03] <versatiletech> ok, think of this situation. There's two buttons on a page that do the same thing. It's determined that the extra one is unnecessarily there. The word to describe this.
[14:31:11] <jedimind> redundant
[14:31:14] <jedimind> useless
[14:31:15] <jedimind> popsicle
[14:31:20] <versatiletech> redundant!!!!
[14:31:28] <versatiletech> that's the word!
[14:32:12] <versatiletech> jedimind: the force is with you
[14:32:23] <oojacoboo> ha
[14:32:31] <oojacoboo> that's just a common english word

[14:33:00] <versatiletech> yep, I've used it a lot to describe things in web development
[14:34:17] <eddiemonge> jedimind: what the heck is a internet+ certification?
[14:34:42] <jedimind> its some eceptionally antiquated shit
[14:34:56] <eddiemonge> does it mean you know how to use the internet?
[14:34:57] <versatiletech> eddiemonge: another reason to cheat you out of money
[14:35:02] <eddiemonge> i want that certification!
[14:35:18] <jedimind> its comptia
[14:35:34] <jedimind> it's retarded, if you know what the A+ certification is, its basicalyl the same silly thing
[14:35:36] <jedimind> but for the internets
[14:35:42] <jedimind> like "what does HTTP stand for?"
[14:35:52] <jedimind> also stop stalking me

[14:38:44] <]Darker[> I am looking for a jquery slideshow that, instead of moving beetween different images, just displays a portion of a very huge image. Do you know if something like that is already written?
[14:41:54] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, can you help me with an abstract problem I am having?
[14:42:55] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: i suck at abstract art. i dont understand it
[14:43:13] <Whirl3d> trust me this isn't art. LOL
[14:43:39] <Whirl3d> I think it's a closure, but not certain.
[14:43:45] <jedimind> eddiemonge, i know right
[14:44:48] <__composern> i've terribly problem with jquery datatables plugin
[14:44:58] <__composern> +jquery-ui
[14:45:14] <viking> is there a place to download jquery's themeswitcher source? all that i can find is the JS file, which references things from jqueryui.com
[14:45:21] <viking> i'd like to install it locally
[14:45:44] <viking> without having to download each thing seperately
[14:45:58] <Whirl3d> I have a collection of .container elements that each have a means of animating from hidden to visible and then adding the class "active" to indicate that they are, well active. So I need to be able to call the .container that's 5 levels deep and tell it to activate. But not until all of it's ancestor containers are ".active"...
[14:46:15] <Whirl3d> It's probably about 3 lines of code and I am just not getting it.
[14:46:49] <tomasm-> hi, does jquery have a way to see if an object/hash has properties or is just empty?
[14:47:51] <eddiemonge> viking: themeswitcher or themeroller?
[14:48:03] <viking> themeswitcher
[14:48:23] <viking> well, i guess themeswitcher uses themeroller, hmm
[14:48:31] <viking> so maybe what i need is themeroller :)
[14:48:36] <rroelofs> tomasm-: if it is a jquery object use .length
[14:49:12] <tomasm-> rroelofs, no, it's a standard hash object... I stumbled across $.isEmptyObject(), which I think is the best way
[15:09:21] <Whirl3d> recursion? anybody? I need a recursive activate/deactivate method for a list of nested elements
[15:09:58] <coldhead> Whirl3d: if this doesn't apply, it's still worth knowing http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[15:11:23] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: have a function that calls itself. in it check to see if there is a child and then animate it and in the animations callback call the parent function again
[15:12:00] <eddiemonge> oops guess i should have looked at your response coldhead
[15:12:02] <andrew___> eddiemonge: Recursive
[15:12:05] <andrew___> You are welcome.
[15:13:51] <Whirl3d> colhead, thanks for the link...it may apply to what I need, but I'm not sure
[15:14:01] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: it does
[15:14:40] <Whirl3d> basically if you have an anchor element that asks for #section-page-topic, the topic can't be seen until the page is, and the page can't be seen until the section is..
[15:15:16] <Whirl3d> So I thought I would call activate(topic) and topic would check it's parent for "active'
[15:15:36] <Whirl3d> if not, it would call active on it's parent with a callback that activate the topic
[15:15:52] <Whirl3d> and then the page would do the same thing to the section.
[15:16:18] <Whirl3d> the section doesn't have an ancestor, so it tells the currently active section to shut down
[15:16:32] <Whirl3d> which gets tricky because it has to check it's current page
[15:16:39] <Whirl3d> which has to check its current topic
[15:17:06] <eddiemonge> sounds confusing sounds confusing sounds
[15:18:05] <Grafica> Hi, I'm a newbie. Does anyone know of some code I could use on an HTML5 & CSS3 Website for rollover navigation buttons with up and down states?
[15:18:25] <Eviltwin> http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/
[15:21:01] <Grafica> Eviltwin: It looks over my head, but I'll make an attempt. Thanks.
[15:22:39] <acidjazz> is it possible to unbind an event inside its handler
[15:23:13] <ajpiano> acidjazz: yes
[15:23:19] <mutedia> those buttons are not aligned properly in firefox
[15:23:23] <ajpiano> so many different ways
[15:24:04] <Eviltwin> acidjazz: One common usecase is already addressed here: http://api.jquery.com/one/
[15:24:35] <ajpiano> and otherwise you can either use a named function or just call unbind("click") or whatever in the handler,
[15:25:42] <coldhead> lol "one common"
[15:25:46] <coldhead> i see what you did there
[15:27:57] <eddiemonge> mutedia: you are right. you should file a bug ticket or see if one exists in bugs.jqueryui.com
[15:27:59] <acidjazz> Eviltwin: ooo
[15:28:28] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: you see that? the submit button style is inconsistent
[15:28:59] <ajpiano> wasn't looking :p
[15:29:11] <ajpiano> just sat down a second ago, shouldn't be doing so at all :p
[15:29:45] <Eviltwin> I know how that goes
[15:32:17] <coldhead> slackers
[15:34:31] <eddiemonge> inorite!
[15:39:26] <Grafica> Eviltwin: For the rollover buttons, what is the "text" option for?
[15:41:16] <gataraid> I need some help, I cannot figure this out for the life of me.  I'm trying to get a image gallery type interface but that slides the "sponsors" across an area defined that is static but the seperate images themselve slide to the right and left.
[15:41:45] <gataraid> Like a carousel but not messing with the sizing of the seperate images.  I hope I made sense.
[15:42:03] <gataraid> If someone could please point me in the direction of something to read, it would be greatly appreciated.
[15:42:41] <coldhead> have you read james joyce's ulysses? that's very good
[15:42:52] <coldhead> also alice's adventures in wonderland
[15:43:33] <Grafica> Will someone help me to create rollover buttons? I'm a newbie, and not very good at programming.
[15:43:35] <gataraid> I meant in regards to my problem, sorry.
[15:44:20] <Eviltwin> gataraid: Can you make a demo of what you're working with at jsFiddle.net?
[15:44:28] <eddiemonge> Grafica: CSS a:hover, a:active
[15:44:52] <gataraid> Eviltwin I'm back at square one atm
[15:45:40] <Eviltwin> I mean like the HTML structure you're looking at
[15:45:41] <coldhead> roll to see who goes first
[15:46:03] <Grafica> eddiemonge: Do you recommend using http://jqueryui.com/demos/button?
[15:46:44] <gataraid> http://www.kag-consulting.co.uk/ - the space below on the main homepage is the area I'm working with.  I was going to place two arrows on each side and then have them slide in one seperate logo/sponsor/etc at a time
[15:47:31] <Eviltwin> So arrows, not just continuous scroll?
[15:47:57] <eddiemonge> Grafica: depends on what you are doing, but generally yes
[15:48:01] <gataraid> Eviltwin right
[15:48:13] <gataraid> Not a continous scroll
[15:49:10] <theshanergy> I've got a new problem for you wise folks. I have a form submitting via ajax.. The form submits properly, and I then ajax load the new content, along with a brand new form.. My issue is this: if a user (after having successfully submit the form) decides to refresh his browser, his old form values appear in the brand new form. Is there a way to prevent this from happening?
[15:49:11] <Eviltwin> So what happens if a non-integer number of images fit within the width?
[15:49:52] <Grafica> eddiemonge: I had a navigation menu in Flash, and I want to convert it to HTML5 & CSS3, so I exported the buttons images from Flash, but I'm lost with JQuery.
[15:51:06] <gataraid> Eviltwin they going to be scaled to fit properly

[16:15:45] <Whirl3d> Okay, I think I got the recursive thing to work, now I can't get callbacks to work: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/eUrSF/29/   any suggestions?
[16:16:51] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[16:24:29] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[16:24:50] <Eviltwin> The first argument to an event handler is the event
[16:24:52] <Eviltwin> Not a callback
[16:24:59] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure what callback you think it would be
[16:26:48] <Whirl3d> doh! Thanks. Just needed to add the e, to the activateItem and deactivateItem params...works now
[16:27:08] <Whirl3d> Thanks for catchin that
[16:30:52] <Whirl3d> Cool. Now anywhere that I have an anchor element of class .nav with href=section-page-article, it'll load correctly. Woot!
[16:33:19] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, I think this is a better solution for deferreds, but then again, I'm always hoping to find a need to learn deferreds...lol
[16:34:30] <nocturnal__> my event handlers are clashing with each other. for instance, when I click on this button "$(#dealCreationFlowDealOrderingBottom #cancel)" it also executed the event handler for $("cancel")
[16:35:43] <nocturnal__> I tried unbind too, but that did not help much
[16:36:10] <Whirl3d> try preventDefault() or return false
[16:38:37] <nocturnal__> Whirl3d: how come the first selector encapsulates $("cancel") tho ?
[16:40:00] <Whirl3d> $("#deal... #cancel") is the same as $("#cancel");
[16:40:02] <eddiemonge> nocturnal__: you are targeting #cancel with that selelector
[16:42:58] <nocturnal__> Whirl3d: is there a way to differentiate between the two in the selector?
[16:43:19] <Whirl3d> a comma
[16:44:12] <Whirl3d> $("#deal...., #cancel").click(function (e) {});   will apply the same function as the click handler for both elements.
[16:45:53] <nocturnal__> I think this might work $(#dealCreationFlowDealOrderingBottom#cancel) ?
[16:56:25] <nocturnal__> Whirl3d: comma does not solve the problem
[16:56:31] <nocturnal__> returning false does
[16:56:36] <nocturnal__> but I do not want to do it that way

[17:21:36] <Ted1> hi, there!
[17:21:54] <Ted1> can anyone help me in a jquery doubt? :/
[17:22:08] <raj> if I'm doing .bind("change_state", myfunc) and then function myfunc(e, data) { }; do i need to pass 'e' and 'data' to myfunc within .bind() as well?
[17:22:50] <Ted1> Ey Raj, do you know how to get the childs of a active parent active also?
[17:23:13] <raj> what?
[17:24:03] <Ted1> I have a list of <span> after 1000 seconds it turns active, and is changing to the next after 1000 secondsâ€¦ how to get the childs of that <span> actives?
[17:25:44] <Ted1> no?
[17:26:21] <mutedia> children()
[17:30:02] <Ted1> mutedia,but how can they be removed after the parent is not active?
[17:31:09] <Ted1> i have done this: var toggleSlide = function() {
[17:31:09] <Ted1> Â  Â Â $("#slider span.active").removeClass().next().add("#slider span:first").last().addClass("active");
[17:31:10] <Ted1> Â  Â Â $("#slider span.active").has(".spanz").addClass("ready");
[17:31:10] <Ted1> };
[17:31:10] <Ted1> setInterval(toggleSlide, 1000);
[17:31:32] <raj> if I'm passing .bind() a named function--> .bind("change_state", myfunc); function myfunc(e, data) { }; do i need to pass 'e' and 'data' to myfunc within .bind() as well?
[17:32:42] <VooDooNOFX_> e and data are passed in by the event you're binding to.
[17:33:07] <Ted1> VooDooN, can you help me? :/
[17:35:16] <Ted1> If i have a list of <span> with childs inside and i want to make them active/deactive when the parent are active/deactive by a timmer how can i do that? sorry i am a newbie.
[17:37:00] <blindMoe> $('.active').children().addClass('active');
[17:37:03] <blindMoe> something like that?
[17:37:37] <blindMoe> I don't think you can monitor an element for when a class changes on it so you may need to just add the code in when the class is added ( if it is done via js at least )
[17:40:08] <Ted1> humâ€¦.
[17:40:15] <Ted1> can i show you what i am doing?

[17:41:32] <Ted1> can you see it? i am almost doing what you say about the childrenâ€¦ but they dont get the class active :(
[17:42:33] <bhar> I have a jquery guestion
[17:42:50] <tw2113> you come to the right place
[17:43:08] <bhar> I am going to change the colors of the pixels of a png image(which is in base64 format). This is my source code:  var myImg = new Image(); myImg.src = <...>; //"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGQAAABkCAYAAABw4pVUAAABQklEQVR4nO3bC27CMBAFQ"; myImg.onload = function() {     var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");     var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");     ctx.drawImage(myImg,0,0);     var imgd = ctx.getImageData(0, 0
[17:43:29] <bhar>  for (i = 0; i <imgd.data.length; i += 4) {         imgd.data[i]   = 255;         imgd.data[i+1] = 0;         imgd.data[i+2] = 255;     }     ctx.putImageData(imgd, 0, 0);     $("#Cell").append(myImg); } the problem is that when I check the value of imgd.data[i] (before changing the color), it is zero for every i. the original image is shown, but the color does not change. Do you know why?
[17:44:12] <bhar> you can see my question here: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-change-the-color-of-a-base64-encoded-png-image-in-jquery
[17:44:22] <bhar> I would appreciate any help
[17:45:13] <Logikos> bhar, i wont be much help, but it will be easier for anyone to help you if you can just put a quick example in jsfiddle.net then post the url
[17:46:05] <tw2113> no PMs Ted1
[17:46:12] <Ted1> trueâ€¦ sorry
[17:47:56] <Ted1> Can anyone help me? i have a list of <span> and i want when the <span> is active the child span became active too and when the parent span is deactive then the child is deactive too, this transition is made by a timmerâ€¦ i have the problem here:  http://jsfiddle.net/MS5DV/8/
[17:49:01] <bhar> <Logikos> thanks, I am trying to do so.
[17:52:53] <Logikos> Ted1: do you mean that when a parent span is set to a class of 'active' you want its childeren span nodes to be set to class active also?
[17:53:58] <Ted1> Logikos, yes!
[17:54:13] <Ted1> but when the parent span is not active the childs are not too
[17:54:31] <Ted1> i have done this so far, Â http://jsfiddle.net/MS5DV/8/ if you want to take a look
[17:54:47] <Logikos> ok, i'm not great at this, but i'll play with it to see if i might be able to figure it out
[17:56:05] <Ted1> thank you a lot!! honestly
[17:57:21] <Ted1> I HAVE DONE IT!!!!
[17:57:31] <Ted1> heres the solution.
[17:57:37] <Ted1> here is the solution.
[17:57:48] <Ted1> http://jsfiddle.net/MS5DV/6/
[17:57:57] <Ted1> Logikos i have done it!
[17:58:02] <Ted1> Thank you
[17:59:21] <Logikos> great, i'm kinda new to javascript, but i enjoy a challenge so i was gonna try, but it would have taken awhile
[17:59:23] <Logikos> glad you got it
[18:00:27] <Logikos> hmm, that example does not apear to be doing what i thought u wanted ... but glad your happy with the result
[18:02:04] <Ted1> humâ€¦ what you though it was what i wanted?
[18:02:13] <Logikos> although now that i think about it, unless you need to the class for other js referenceing ... if it was just for styleing ... you could have acomplished it with css ... by changing .active { } to .active, .active span { }
[18:02:34] <Ted1> and the timmer? :/
[18:03:23] <Logikos> i didnt mean to get rid of the javascript, i jus tment to add the css to get the first example you posted to have the .active style affect both the node made .active and its childern span elements
[18:03:43] <Logikos> which is what i thought you wanted, you would still need the javascript to loop though the parents .. but css could have applyed the style to both
[18:05:14] <Ted1> yes, but this is a small portion of what i wantâ€¦ let me finish and i will show you
[18:05:16] <Ted1> :)
[18:33:22] <zduffy> How would I access Base in this json encode array? http://pastebin.com/K0ycne4r
[18:35:35] <IgnisDiabolus> zduffy: using $.ajax()?
[18:35:50] <zduffy> IgnisBiabolus: Yes
[18:36:21] <IgnisDiabolus> on the success: function(json){ var base = json.Base; }
[18:36:40] <IgnisDiabolus> dataType: 'json'
[18:38:25] <zduffy> This is the function I'm using, and it always selects TotalPrice: http://pastebin.com/XWYwU1sm
[18:39:21] <zduffy> I'm assuming because .val(price.toFixed(2) selects the first number in the array?
[18:39:43] <bhar> I am going to change the colors of the pixels of a png image(which is in base64 format). This is my source code:  http://jsfiddle.net/4TVCf/2/ http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-change-the-color-of-a-base64-encoded-png-image-in-jquery the problem is that when I check the value of imgd.data[i], it is zero for every i. the original image is shown, but the color does not change. Do you know why?
[18:40:40] <alexr2> zduffy what do you mean it always selects totalprice?
[18:41:25] <zduffy> alexr2: I have a three classes to display the array, and it always displays TotalPrice
[18:44:22] <alexr2> I don't get what problem you're having?
[18:46:39] <feathersanddown> sorry, but still don't understand how to select all inputs elements, something like this?: $('input')
[18:47:23] <alexr2> feathersanddown Yes, that will select all input elements
[18:47:35] <IgnisDiabolus> feathersanddown: yes...
[18:47:45] <IgnisDiabolus> $('input, textarea, select')
[18:48:12] <feathersanddown> but why I get null  from ff console  ?
[18:48:28] <IgnisDiabolus> feathersanddown: can you recreate it in jsfiddle?
[18:48:32] <alexr2> ^^
[18:49:40] <feathersanddown> let me see
[18:51:34] <feathersanddown> http://jsfiddle.net/UtEgd/
[18:52:13] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net/UtEgd/1/
[18:52:19] <alexr2> $('input') selects your input elements..?
[18:53:14] <feathersanddown> that is my question, how to select whole inputs
[18:53:49] <feathersanddown> ah!, ok... let me see...
[18:54:20] <feathersanddown> yes
[18:54:21] <feathersanddown> it does
[18:54:31] <feathersanddown> but why not in firebug console ?
[18:54:34] <feathersanddown> directly ...
[18:54:49] <alexr2> No clue, I don't use firebug
[18:55:00] <feathersanddown> aarrrgghh
[18:55:13] <niplnutz> So i got this odd problem, it seems after a recent update of chrome, my ajax post calls are broken if they are done after a jquery..load(), only on chrome.  The posts get turned into gets and post back the whole form as html regardless of options.  Anyone else seen this?
[18:55:13] <feathersanddown> start to manually debug it
[18:56:07] <niplnutz> regardless of .ajax or .post
[18:56:56] <alexr2> niplnutz jsfiddle :-)
[19:04:23] <IgnisDiabolus> hi feathersanddown
[19:04:40] <CharlesBroughton> Chances are someone could answer this easily:  When I'm doing alert($('#username').value) I am getting "undefined" regardless of the value of the field with that ID.  Same thing goes for when I try .nodeValue
[19:04:59] <CharlesBroughton> Or with jQuery am I supposed to use some sort of getValue() instead?
[19:05:17] <IgnisDiabolus> feathersanddown: http://jsfiddle.net/UtEgd/2/ sorry for the delay
[19:05:42] <IgnisDiabolus> CharlesBroughton: $('#username').val();
[19:06:05] <IgnisDiabolus> which is equal to document.getElementById('username').value;
[19:06:17] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: :/  Why .val();  That doesn't even make sense (compared to JS), was there reasoning for the choice of function name, or does value have some other meaning in jQuery?
[19:06:44] <IgnisDiabolus> in the aspect, i have no idea... ask the core developers
[19:07:00] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: Let me guess, I can't do .className or .nodeValue in a set method can I?
[19:07:16] <IgnisDiabolus> of course, if you want to set the value you can do $('#username').val('a custom value');
[19:07:29] <niplnutz> alexr2: Im new to fiddle, never had a problem like this before, but basically this is it: http://jsfiddle.net/pUezn/
[19:07:32] <IgnisDiabolus> .addClass()
[19:07:51] <IgnisDiabolus> and .removeClass()
[19:08:08] <niplnutz> If I dont do the load it works fine, if I do the load it makes the post a get and sends everything via HTML, not json.  And it doesnt succeed
[19:08:24] <niplnutz> But this is only for chrome and only showed up the last week
[19:09:04] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: And setting the class?  .setClass() ?
[19:09:43] <niplnutz> Its like the ajax engine is borkened, any way to reset it?
[19:10:08] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: Seems there is no .setClass :/
[19:10:20] <IgnisDiabolus> .addClass() does that
[19:10:32] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: Yeah well... kinda need to remove existing classes too...
[19:10:44] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: Without knowing what they are.
[19:10:58] <IgnisDiabolus> .attr('class', '');
[19:11:05] <niplnutz> I just realized I am running Dev branch, I guess this is an issue for chrome....
[19:11:22] <niplnutz> I hope they dont push this bug to stable :|
[19:12:05] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: Heh, and now .val('test'); isn't actually changing the value, nor is it erroring out :/
[19:13:06] <niplnutz> brb going to flip back to stable see if it persists.  If it goes away I guess I will submit a bug to chrome.
[19:14:09] <raj> can neither bind nor each take a named function?
[19:14:36] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: Seems also that in FF if I set $('#username').attr('class', 'field valid'); the rendering engine does not bother updating, field still shows as if it didn't have the "valid" class.
[19:15:43] <IgnisDiabolus> CharlesBroughton: http://jsfiddle.net/mJxSP/
[19:16:47] <IgnisDiabolus> please read the docs. it's actually easy to use jQuery
[19:17:08] <IgnisDiabolus> it makes js coding, easier... imo
[19:18:21] <xp_prg> what is the best way to invoke json on a form submit?
[19:24:25] <oojacoboo> what format do you guys use for your js for comments for functions?
[19:24:41] <oojacoboo> do you use the phpdoc format, or a custom one, or is there a js comment standard, or?
[19:25:19] <oojacoboo> scriptdoc?
[19:25:22] <IgnisDiabolus> oojacoboo: what format is this? http://pastebin.com/uYwQNXQE
[19:25:31] <IgnisDiabolus> jk
[19:25:33] <oojacoboo> IgnisDiabolus: phpdoc
[19:25:52] <IgnisDiabolus> i use that... but my comments are not that verbose
[19:26:04] <IgnisDiabolus> and it doesn't really generate documentation :\
[19:26:10] <oojacoboo> I just didn't know if it was considered taboo to do that
[19:26:12] <oojacoboo> with js
[19:26:49] <intlrc> i just use a variation of javadoc above each function header with params and return
[19:26:51] <oojacoboo> I've only seen thisâ€¦ http://scriptdoc.org/specification.htm/
[19:27:14] <oojacoboo> mmm, wtf
[19:27:36] <IgnisDiabolus> what's that site?
[19:27:44] <oojacoboo> no idea, don't go there
[19:28:04] <oojacoboo> I got it from this article :/
[19:28:04] <oojacoboo> http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/programming-and-development/write-javascript-documentation-with-the-scriptdoc-standard/575
[19:28:10] <oojacoboo> apparently it's changed?
[19:28:17] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: http://jsfiddle.net/kKpba/
[19:29:54] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: No errors, and no text changes.
[19:30:05] <intlrc> oojacoboo: were you asking about a cooments automator for js?
[19:30:23] <oojacoboo> na, just about what standards are most accepted
[19:30:35] <intlrc> ah ehe
[19:30:37] <oojacoboo> it appears that no one can agree on one, so it's a wild west it appears
[19:30:45] <intlrc> scriptdoc looks to me another variation of javadoc
[19:30:53] <oojacoboo> similar to phpdoc as well
[19:31:07] <intlrc> yeha, phpdoc is too another variation of javadoc
[19:31:07] <CharlesBroughton> If anyone can help with that JSFiddle I linked, I'd appreciate it.
[19:32:05] <oojacoboo> what do you say farnsworth, "the fiddler on the fucking roof"
[19:35:00] <CharlesBroughton> http://jsfiddle.net/kKpba/1/ is an update on the post with a ... stricter JS, still not working though even though it's technically "correct" and produces no errors when run.
[19:36:17] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: set them as vars for starters
[19:36:27] <oojacoboo> don't create a new object each time
[19:36:46] <intlrc> you can save a lot of lines
[19:36:49] <intlrc> using instead             var target = (e.target) ? e.target : window.event.srcElement;
[19:37:05] <CharlesBroughton> intlrc: Unfortunately that doesn't handle the third possibility (safari)
[19:37:34] <CharlesBroughton> This is dev code anyways, I'm more interested in why it doesn't work versus the lint says, I'll work on that later.
[19:37:40] <CharlesBroughton> Thanks for the input though :)  Definintely useful.
[19:38:18] <intlrc> CharlesBroughton: sorry, i was unware of that safari bug
[19:38:35] <intlrc> i always use the instruction above
[19:39:10] <CharlesBroughton> intlrc: Yeah, unfortunately with Safari (god I hate browser compat) certain versions return (for whatever dumbass reason) the child of the vent as the "event target"
[19:39:16] <CharlesBroughton> instead of the event itself.
[19:39:19] <CharlesBroughton> target **
[19:40:29] <intlrc> yeah, i am gonna check that
[19:40:42] <intlrc> btw, what isn't working on your code?
[19:42:07] <CharlesBroughton> Check the run, if you type anything in the pass boxes... the warning isn't updated at all, and no errors are outputted.
[19:42:37] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: did you create vars?
[19:42:46] <oojacoboo> don't create new objects each time
[19:43:13] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: Shouldn't change a thing, at all.  That's performance vs lack of errors / output.  However; I have done this and am updating the fiddle.
[19:44:32] <CharlesBroughton> Yeah, even with variables (shouldn't have helped anyways, and it didn't) still nothing happens.
[19:44:35] <CharlesBroughton> http://jsfiddle.net/kKpba/2/
[19:48:52] <intlrc> CharlesBroughton: i am sorry, but with me it just fires the console with ca not defined error, you know why?
[19:49:04] <intlrc> Uncaught ReferenceError: ca is not defined
[19:49:13] <CharlesBroughton> intlrc: Shouldn't, ca is the function I defined in the JS section of jsfiddle :/
[19:49:16] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: why are you using val() for a div?
[19:49:33] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: That's what the guy above said to use when I was trying .value
[19:49:41] <oojacoboo> why wouldn't you use html?
[19:49:44] <oojacoboo> or content?
[19:49:46] <intlrc> CharlesBroughton: yeah i know, that's why i don't understand
[19:49:49] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus said *
[19:50:15] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: .innerHtml / .val should all work, yes?
[19:50:35] <IgnisDiabolus> CharlesBroughton: you were refering to an input element earlier
[19:50:47] <IgnisDiabolus> and your example was document.getElementById('username').value
[19:50:57] <CharlesBroughton> Even if that was the issue, why isn't the class change firing either?
[19:51:04] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: where is the event?
[19:51:22] <oojacoboo> why aren't you using onBlur for the password inputs?
[19:51:27] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: What do you mean where's the event?  jsfiddle'd all the code relevent...
[19:51:58] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: The fields are all generated with a method and a variable name / attrs, I sent the onKeyUp to all of them.
[19:52:05] <CharlesBroughton> Again, this doesn't help the code not working.
[19:52:18] <IgnisDiabolus> i figure you should check your code and stop blaming jQuery
[19:52:23] <oojacoboo> alert your vals
[19:52:27] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: The code isn't erroring, etc.
[19:52:33] <oojacoboo> how is it firing?
[19:52:34] <IgnisDiabolus> jQuery is working fine. use console.log()
[19:52:40] <CharlesBroughton> The .val() alerts with correct values when tested on the site.
[19:52:54] <oojacoboo> then make a fiddle that works
[19:52:58] <IgnisDiabolus> use the .on() event listener instead of putting onKeyUp
[19:53:02] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: Seems to be firing fine, when I type in the boxes the function fires.  If I put a alert('test'); at the bottom, it shows the alert box.
[19:53:26] <IgnisDiabolus> $('#idSelector').on('keyup', function(e) {});
[19:53:36] <oojacoboo> no
[19:53:40] <CharlesBroughton> This is one of those "I don't like your code."
[19:53:45] <oojacoboo> you don't need to bind the event
[19:53:46] <CharlesBroughton> not "This is why it's not working"
[19:54:25] <CharlesBroughton> The actual code is running on https://secure.academyintl.net/register.php , the registration is nonfunctional at the moment of course, but the validation is supposed to work.
[19:54:32] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: it's one of thoseâ€¦ "I have no clue why it looks so complex to password check"
[19:54:55] <IgnisDiabolus> hehe
[19:55:00] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: The ca() function is the general "validate form" function.
[19:55:08] <oojacoboo> which is called by an event?
[19:55:11] <CharlesBroughton> Firebug console reports no errors / warnings / etc.
[19:55:17] <oojacoboo> b/c there isn't one that I see in this fiddle
[19:55:23] <CharlesBroughton> -_-
[19:55:36] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: Look at the HTML, it's called everytime you onKeyUp in the text boxes.
[19:55:45] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: It's meant to do live validation, as the comments would suggest.
[19:55:51] <oojacoboo> lol
[19:55:53] <oojacoboo> don't do that!
[19:56:04] <CharlesBroughton> Validate usernames as available / not taken as people type, etc.
[19:56:04] <oojacoboo> that's deprecated shit ayway
[19:56:09] <intlrc> oojacoboo: does the event fire with you?
[19:56:14] <IgnisDiabolus> oojacoboo: i told you he should use the .on listener
[19:56:19] <raj> what's the difference btwn find() and next()?
[19:56:25] <CharlesBroughton> Ugh, look; I'll go put an alert in there for you.
[19:56:27] <oojacoboo> IgnisDiabolus: no he shouldn't
[19:56:45] <CharlesBroughton> What was that debugger?  console.log(msg); ?
[19:56:48] <IgnisDiabolus> raj, find() finds a child element, next() goes to next sibling element
[19:56:51] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: rewrite your event into your js, not hte DOM
[19:56:57] <oojacoboo> then paste back the fiddle
[19:57:17] <IgnisDiabolus> why shouldn't he? he wants to validate on every keyup
[19:57:19] <IgnisDiabolus> :)
[19:57:22] <raj> IgnisDiabolus, does a sibling have to be an element of the same type?
[19:57:42] <oojacoboo> IgnisDiabolus: and why can't that be in the js??
[19:57:53] <oojacoboo> you don't put that in the DOM, that's deprecated anyway
[19:57:57] <IgnisDiabolus> isn't bind in the JS?
[19:58:01] <oojacoboo> ><
[19:58:08] <IgnisDiabolus> wtf i'm confused
[19:58:13] <CharlesBroughton> Interesting, when I added a console.log() the blocks are magically changing their text now, but the class change is not working however.
[19:58:15] <oojacoboo> me too, you're making no sense
[19:58:23] <IgnisDiabolus> lmao
[19:58:25] <IgnisDiabolus> sorry dude
[19:58:51] <IgnisDiabolus> he got onKeyUp on every input element. i'm suggesting he removes that and bind in his js file instead...
[19:58:58] <IgnisDiabolus> using the .on() jQuery function
[19:59:07] <oojacoboo> IgnisDiabolus: binding isn't necessary
[19:59:15] <oojacoboo> no .on()
[19:59:19] <oojacoboo> not needed
[19:59:23] <IgnisDiabolus> so $('input').on('keyup', function(e) {});
[19:59:32] <IgnisDiabolus> why? how does he know when to validate?
[19:59:34] <CharlesBroughton> Oi, this whole "do your events this way" doesn't sotp the whole " it's not working " thing.
[19:59:35] <oojacoboo> no, just .keyup
[19:59:47] <raj> IgnisDiabolus, will .find find something a few layers in?
[19:59:48] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: you can do it right, or I'm not helping
[19:59:51] <oojacoboo> that's how it works
[19:59:51] <IgnisDiabolus> freaking same
[19:59:58] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: You guys don't even know what "right" is.
[20:00:07] <oojacoboo> cool, g/l then
[20:00:07] <CharlesBroughton> You're argueing over "DO THIS", " NO, DON'T DO THIS "
[20:00:11] <IgnisDiabolus> CharlesBroughton: you know what's right... :)
[20:00:17] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: Is saying something about binding
[20:00:27] <intlrc> CharlesBroughton: i guess it's cause, in my case i can't seem to fire the event
[20:00:27] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: is saying against **
[20:00:30] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: Is saying to :/
[20:00:40] <CharlesBroughton> intlrc: Firebug console is showing all those logs when I type in it now.
[20:00:46] <IgnisDiabolus> CharlesBroughton: my bad. oojacoboo is right. .on would remove every event on input
[20:01:00] <oojacoboo> no it wouldn't
[20:01:04] <IgnisDiabolus> wtf. i'm gonna take some lunch. you talk to oojacoboo. my mind's a blur
[20:01:04] <CharlesBroughton> -_-
[20:01:11] <oojacoboo> binding is only needed if the DOM is being altered
[20:01:19] <oojacoboo> it's going to setup the event on itself
[20:01:44] <IgnisDiabolus> CharlesBroughton: use .keyup then
[20:01:54] <CharlesBroughton> As I said, this is dev code.  Wehn I finish the generator that actually puts these pages together, (when I implement the jQuery / JS handler) I can have it do proper bindings, however; at the moment, varpass2.attr('class', 'someclasses'); isn't working.
[20:02:17] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: if you don't know how to fix it, you should listen
[20:02:36] <oojacoboo> and the first issue is that this code is utter crap
[20:02:46] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: I don't have a means to drop a large chunk of jQuery code into the jQuery onload handler.  It's not "not listening" it's "impossible".
[20:02:49] <oojacoboo> and DO NOT put your events in your DOM
[20:03:37] <CharlesBroughton> As you notice, I'm using google's API loader, which means I'd need access to the callback function to put a binder, which is not possible without me finishing implementation of the JS parser in the generator here, hence why it's an inline js block at the moment.
[20:04:44] <CharlesBroughton> The only way around this would be to rip a large chunk of the HTML generator out of the application and drop a static file in there for testing.
[20:04:57] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: why not use .addClass()
[20:05:20] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: Because I need to remove all existing classes first; without knowing what they are.  Classes could be anything field and invalid / valid are test classes.
[20:05:37] <IgnisDiabolus> for one. i'm getting ca not defined
[20:05:43] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: removeClass()
[20:05:55] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: Again, without knowing what they are.
[20:05:56] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: With the generator, class names are more likely to be aax aay aaz
[20:06:14] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: I don't see why you're getting that, when there's a big "function ca(e)" thing as the first line.
[20:06:15] <CharlesBroughton> :/
[20:06:20] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: you can remove all with that
[20:06:48] <oojacoboo> but you're doing it fine with the attr
[20:06:51] <oojacoboo> that's pretty clean actually
[20:07:51] <PressedWeb> Newbie question here: How do I say "If you click this element OR this other element do..." ?
[20:08:09] <PressedWeb> Basically assign multiple elements to the same event
[20:08:16] <oojacoboo> $("element").click(fucntion() {});
[20:08:27] <oojacoboo> function*
[20:08:38] <IgnisDiabolus> http://jsfiddle.net/tzRXY/
[20:08:44] <IgnisDiabolus> CharlesBroughton: please try
[20:09:07] <oojacoboo> IgnisDiabolus: ;)
[20:09:11] <CharlesBroughton> IgnisDiabolus: Lol, in your code you return false in there.  I can't actually type into either password box.
[20:09:15] <PressedWeb> oojacoboo: Yeah, but multiple elements. Like p.hello and div.goodbye ?
[20:09:24] <oojacoboo> PressedWeb: sure
[20:09:40] <intlrc> PressedWeb: assign an event handler to a parent div of all those elements, and check the e to see witch children matches
[20:09:51] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: so rewrite it, the event works though, that's the point
[20:11:14] <IgnisDiabolus> i just copy pasted :)
[20:11:42] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: I don't get it, the event works fine in my testsite I linked, as well it also runs in the fiddle for me... :/  Firebug console shows it all, etc.
[20:12:21] <IgnisDiabolus> i'm gonna have my lunch. good luck
[20:12:27] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: I put an alert in there and it didn't fire with anything on the inputs
[20:12:33] <oojacoboo> so, I consider that not working
[20:12:40] <oojacoboo> I didn't spend much more time past that
[20:12:57] <PressedWeb> Ok
[20:12:58] <CharlesBroughton> https://secure.academyintl.net/register.php  Use your favourite console and enjoy the console.log spam
[20:13:36] <oojacoboo> ok?
[20:13:41] <oojacoboo> so it works, what's the issue?
[20:14:06] <intlrc> yeah on that page it works
[20:14:27] <oojacoboo> except his code sucks and you can't re-evaluate
[20:14:31] <CharlesBroughton> -_-  The class is not changed...
[20:14:51] <CharlesBroughton> The whole reason why I've been sitting here for 30 mins asking.
[20:15:00] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: it did change
[20:15:04] <CharlesBroughton> Is because the class is not changing, the field is not re-rendering as a red box as it should when it's invalid.
[20:15:05] <oojacoboo> it added invalud
[20:15:07] <oojacoboo> invalid
[20:15:14] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: Sure, the text is changing, but the background color and border isn't.
[20:15:25] <oojacoboo> in your css use .field.invalid
[20:15:31] <oojacoboo> for your invalid styles
[20:15:58] <oojacoboo> NO SPACE
[20:16:34] <oojacoboo> then next time, maybe you should phrase your question as just that, instead of assuming you know the issue
[20:16:40] <oojacoboo> or even what you're doing for that matter
[20:17:58] <intlrc> well i am off to bed, cya guys*
[20:18:09] <CharlesBroughton> oojacoboo: No change, since the space doesn't change / mean anything.
[20:18:27] <oojacoboo> CharlesBroughton: are you serious!?
[20:18:35] <oojacoboo> a fucking space means it's a nested child element
[20:18:45] <oojacoboo> .field.invalid means it's the same element
[20:18:52] <oojacoboo> you don't even understand css
[20:18:59] <oojacoboo> I'm done speaking with you, g/l
[20:28:36] <billy_> how to make the tab work propelly http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#jquery
[20:29:07] <billy_> http://jsfiddle.net/7XHqL/
[20:29:22] <billy_> how to make the tab working propely
[20:31:24] <Anphonic> Can someone look at this and perhaps see why its not entering the if loop, though the condition is correct?
[20:31:29] <Anphonic> http://jsfiddle.net/uTaAH/
[20:38:58] <billy_> any body can help me ?
[20:39:09] <billy_> http://jsfiddle.net/7XHqL/ i want to make the tabs working propely
[20:47:11] <Logikos> billy_: first of all you have mootools selected as your framework
[20:47:34] <Logikos> consol reads: $(document).ready is not a function
[20:47:39] <Logikos> because jquery isnt loaded
[20:48:42] <Logikos> after selecting the right lib, consol shows: $("#tabs").tabs is not a function
[20:48:52] <Logikos> if your useing firebug you can view your consol very easily ?
[20:49:14] <billy_> http://jsfiddle.net/7XHqL/2/ ok he right is here :D
[20:51:51] <Logikos> next, i'm not saying this is the reason for your problem but: <img src="http://lorempixel.com/output/people-q-c-200-200-9.jpg" data-alternate="http://lorempixel.com/output/people-q-c-200-200-4.jpg">
[20:52:05] <Logikos> data-alternate is not a valid paramater....
[20:53:04] <Logikos> attribute rather
[20:54:30] <billy_> some one create plugin for , if im hover the image the image will change
[20:57:11] <Anphonic> Can someone look at this and perhaps see why its not entering the if loop, though the condition is correct?
[20:57:12] <Anphonic> http://jsfiddle.net/uTaAH/
[20:58:34] <Mage> your code is very hard to read
[20:59:16] <Logikos> Anphonic it is entering the loop: http://jsfiddle.net/uTaAH/1/
[21:00:01] <Logikos> well, it is entering the conditional your checking in consol
[21:00:34] <Mage> div#ap_pht_wrapper doesn't exist
[21:00:38] <Mage> v0v
[21:01:10] <Anphonic> Thats why its created and prepended inside the loo[
[21:01:14] <Anphonic> loop*
[21:01:24] <Anphonic> without the if, it works great.
[21:01:26] <Mage> neither does divArtWrapper apparently
[21:01:54] <Anphonic> var divArtWrapper =, first var created
[21:01:59] <Mage> yes
[21:02:00] <Mage> it's empty
[21:02:02] <Mage> it's an empty array
[21:02:07] <Mage> it prints out [] at the console
[21:02:31] <Mage> then you prepend html to that empty array (so nothing changes)
[21:02:37] * Anphonic sees why and wonders who turned off all the titles
[21:02:41] <Mage> then you try and reference the id that you've just prepended (to nothing)
[21:02:53] <Anphonic> yeah I see why now, it was staring me in the face
[21:03:03] <Mage> to avoid this in the future, you may want to try a lot more console.log things
[21:03:12] <Mage> to use an overused meme, console.log ALL THE THINGS
[21:03:17] <Anphonic> its dependant on the title being turned on and someone turned them off
[21:03:27] <Mage> :)
[21:03:36] <Mage> I also don't know anything about .find or .siblings
[21:03:39] <Mage> i have never used those before
[21:03:44] <Mage> so i dont know if they're supercoolfast or bad
[21:03:45] <Mage> v0v
[21:04:13] <Anphonic> I had to go about a convoluted way of getting the images since we were unable to add classes till recently
[21:04:49] <Anphonic> so had to get the sibligns of the sibling of the h2 :/
[21:06:41] <Anphonic> Thanks for making me look at it cross eyed
[21:10:24] <PressedWeb> Hey guys, how do I stop in-page anchors from jumping to the top of the page?
[21:10:38] <PressedWeb> I'm trying a[href="#"] e.preventDefault() to no avail.
[21:12:30] <digitalmediaguy1> Good Eveningâ€¦ I have been looking for a jQuery plugin that is a "quad-directional infinite scroller" LOL... Basically I am looking to build an infinite grid of images where you can scroll and scroll in any direction and have it load content dynamically?!
[21:13:08] <digitalmediaguy1> I have found examples for up and downâ€¦ but has anyone ever done all four directions?
[21:13:58] <Logikos> kinda like google maps?
[21:14:04] <Cork> ?p @ PressedWeb
[21:14:05] <bot-t> PressedWeb, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:15:10] <Cork> digitalmediaguy1: right and down should be simple, up and left is the tricky ones
[21:15:55] <Cork> digitalmediaguy1: and with images you prob want to remove them after a few grids, to reduce the memory usage
[21:16:37] <PressedWeb> Cork: HTML:  <a href="#">Foo</a>    JS:  $('a[href="#"]').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[21:17:01] <PressedWeb> Basically just trying to get it to stop jumping to the top of the page everything an anchor with # is clicked on
[21:17:07] <Cork> PressedWeb: make a fully working example
[21:17:32] <PressedWeb> Ok, 1 second.
[21:17:33] <Cork> your code should work, so just the partial won't show why it doesn't work for you
[21:18:29] <xiam> digitalmediaguy1: sounds fun
[21:21:24] <PressedWeb> Cork: Actually, it does seem to work (I was testing on images before).
[21:21:56] <PressedWeb> Cork: Still having trouble with the images causing that jump though. No idea what's up with it, but now that I think about it, it's not that big of a deal.
[21:22:41] <Cork> PressedWeb: do you get the # in the url bar?
[21:23:07] <PressedWeb> Not with the images
[21:23:20] <PressedWeb> I  have an onClick event firing when you click on an image
[21:23:27] <PressedWeb> And it jumps to the top of the page for some reason
[21:23:39] <Cork> well, to be able to help you i need to see the code in action
[21:24:49] <PressedWeb> Cork: http://pressedweb.com/sandbox/cheryl/
[21:25:23] <Heshanh> is there a way to find if the page has scroll?
[21:25:24] <PressedWeb> The "slider" thing. If you click on one of the images, it expands the content appropriately, but will also jump to top of the page.
[21:25:24] <munderwo> hi all. Im trying to do a cross domain request. As far as I can tell im doing everything right. My code is doing an OPTIONS request, getting back a 200 with the right headers, but when it does a POST it seems like chrome is cancelling it? anybody got any ideas on how.why or what to troubleshoot?
[21:25:46] <PressedWeb> Heshanh: What do you mean by page has scroll? If the viewport has a scrollbar?
[21:25:56] <Heshanh> yeah
[21:26:16] <Heshanh> i... got a strange issue and css is getting me no where.
[21:26:21] <PressedWeb> if ($(body).height() > $(window).height() ) { ... }
[21:26:30] <PressedWeb> Maybe... I'm no jQuery guru, but you could try that
[21:26:32] <Anphonic> PressedWeb: you can leave the href="#" off and the anchors will still work
[21:26:44] <Heshanh> i have a footer i need to fix to the bottom of the page, it works if theres no scroll. i need to remove pos:abs if theres scroll on a style
[21:27:04] <PressedWeb> Anphonic: Not worried about the anchors anymore. Realized they were working. It's the onClick event tied to my images in my slider
[21:27:11] <Anphonic> ah ok
[21:27:34] <Cork> Anphonic: no it won't
[21:27:42] <Heshanh> thanks that line will do the trick :)
[21:27:47] <Cork> Anphonic: old ie's doesn't show the a tag if you remove the href
[21:27:48] <PressedWeb> O yah?!
[21:27:58] <PressedWeb> Woot! I'm an uber l447 hax0r!
[21:28:27] <Cork> PressedWeb: anyway as i can't fiddle with the code (as you didn't make one), i can only guess
[21:28:28] <PressedWeb> Cork: I suspect it might have something to do with the fadeOut/fadeIn stuff.
[21:28:39] <Cork> but i suspect its caused by the fadeout
[21:28:51] <Cork> fadeout will set display:none when its done
[21:29:03] <Anphonic> Cork: true, but unless its a hard requirement, coding towards anything less than 8 is getting ridiculous
[21:29:03] <Cork> and that will make the page contract
[21:29:15] <Cork> PressedWeb: and cause your jump
[21:29:35] <Cork> PressedWeb: use animate({ opacity:0 })animate({ opacity:1 }) instead
[21:30:34] <Cork> Anphonic: if your usaing a tags using href="#" is a good practis actually
[21:30:52] <Cork> Anphonic: though i'm a big advocat of stopping to abuse a tags completly
[21:31:08] <Cork> if its not a link; don't use a tags
[21:31:19] <Cork> use the element you already have or add a span
[21:31:26] <PressedWeb> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/zpsBw/
[21:31:37] <PressedWeb> Yeah, I think you're right.
[21:31:49] <PressedWeb> While I was writing the fiddle I got that sneaking suspicion
[21:32:27] <Anphonic> Cork: true, I have only done that once recently and that one on an image map I didn't have time to redo, silly getting in a hurry and taking shortcuts :
[21:32:29] <Anphonic> :P
[21:32:46] <PressedWeb> Cork: Yup, works perfect now with opacity.
[21:32:56] <PressedWeb> Funny how display:none destroys the element :\
[21:34:08] <Cork> PressedWeb: it doesn't destroy
[21:34:09] <PressedWeb> http://jsfiddle.net/zpsBw/1/
[21:34:16] <Cork> it means the element taks no space
[21:34:25] <Cork> so what you see is actually expected behavior
[21:34:41] <Cork> PressedWeb: http://jsfiddle.net/zpsBw/2/
[21:35:09] <PressedWeb> Hm..
[21:35:49] <PressedWeb> I suppose it doesn't "destroy" destroy like .remove()
[21:35:56] <Cork> nope
[21:36:07] <PressedWeb> But it's definitely not something I'd expect.
[21:36:07] <Cork> display: none; means height:0;width:0;
[21:36:27] <PressedWeb> Seems like fadeOut() should automatically animate({ opacity:0 })
[21:36:28] <Cork> visibility: hidden; doesn't make that change
[21:36:38] <Cork> it does
[21:36:49] <Cork> and when the animation is complete it sets display: none
[21:36:56] <PressedWeb> Bleh
[21:37:24] <PressedWeb> Maybe there should be a separate function for that. Like fadeOutAndHide()
[21:37:36] <Cork> or right display: none; removes margins and things like that too
[21:37:42] <Krinkle> PressedWeb: But fadeOut is a very simple wrapper for animate() if you don't want it to set display none, just use animate()
[21:38:12] <Cork> PressedWeb: normally when you hide element you don't want them to take place on the page when its removed
[21:38:12] <PressedWeb> Krinkle: Yeah. It's easy enough. Is this explained on the fadeOut page?
[21:38:14] <Krinkle> No point in making more 1 line aliases that "nobody" uses.
[21:38:21] <Cork> PressedWeb: so the default action is actually expected
[21:38:24] <Krinkle> PressedWeb: Good point :) Lets find out
[21:38:26] <Krinkle> ?fadeOut
[21:38:27] <bot-t> .fadeOut([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[21:38:29] <Cork> uh not expeted
[21:38:32] <Cork> but wanted
[21:38:42] <Krinkle> "The .fadeOut() method animates the opacity of the matched elements. Once the opacity reaches 0, the display style property is set to none, so the element no longer affects the layout of the page."
[21:38:54] <Krinkle> Yep :)
[21:39:19] <Cork> rfm then ;P
[21:39:20] <Krinkle> PressedWeb: There is also fadeTo()
[21:39:22] <PressedWeb> I see, but maybe there should be a little note about how this may or may not affect functionality
[21:39:26] <Krinkle> ?fadeTo
[21:39:27] <bot-t> .fadeTo(duration, opacity, [callback]): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[21:39:38] <Krinkle> I think fadeTo(0) doesn't set display none
[21:40:41] <Cork> PressedWeb: the amount of corner cases fadeOut can affect is actually quite large
[21:41:08] <PressedWeb> fadeTo works well: http://jsfiddle.net/zpsBw/3/
[21:41:23] <PressedWeb> "corner cases" like mine?
[21:41:24] <Cork> so i actually think it falls on the developers chair to know how the page works
[21:41:28] <Cork> yes
[21:41:34] <PressedWeb> Gotcha
[21:41:42] <PressedWeb> Well, appreciate the help guys
[21:41:47] <PressedWeb> Learned a couple things ;)
[21:41:57] <Cork> other probems i've seen is ex. fading inline elements
[21:42:04] <Cork> and elements around it jumps around
[21:42:10] <Cork> or problems with padding and so on
[21:42:14] <Cork> overflow: hidden...
[21:42:21] <Cork> the list goes on and on
[21:42:27] <Krinkle> yeah, it's not uncommon, but in those cases fadeOut is simply not the function you wanna use
[21:42:42] * Cork nods
[21:43:05] <Cork> actually some of them is exatly what fadeOut is meant for
[21:43:20] <Cork> you just need to adjust your css and dom structure for it to work
[21:43:50] <PressedWeb> Either of you have ability to update API?
[21:44:04] <Cork> nope
[21:44:18] <PressedWeb> If so, I might add a little note about how display:none affects the layout.
[21:44:26] <PressedWeb> I didn't realize ;)
[21:44:43] <Cork> PressedWeb: uh... thats basic knowlage about css
[21:45:08] <Anphonic> Basic is a relative term though
[21:45:24] <Krinkle> PressedWeb: http://jsfiddle.net/zpsBw/4/
[21:45:26] <Krinkle> this one is also fun
[21:45:31] <Anphonic> Should it be? no, but it is
[21:45:34] <Krinkle> changes the image when opacity is 0
[21:45:59] <Cork> Anphonic: before you start writing webpages you should learn some of the basic things
[21:46:16] <PressedWeb> Cork: I'm pretty "okay" at css and I didn't fully understand how display:none worked
[21:46:23] <Krinkle> http://jsfiddle.net/zpsBw/5/ (more stable)
[21:46:29] <Cork> valid html, css selectors, and the basic old css properties
[21:46:36] <PressedWeb> yayaya
[21:46:37] <Cork> PressedWeb: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/display
[21:46:44] <Krinkle> ?display
[21:46:46] <bot-t> Krinkle, .toggle() - Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[21:46:55] <Krinkle> Hm.. maybe implement a fallback to MDC
[21:47:03] <Krinkle> MDN*
[21:47:03] <Cork> ?mdc css display
[21:47:11] <Cork> ?mdn css display
[21:47:19] <Krinkle> Grr, you've thought of everything :)
[21:47:22] <Cork> hmm that should work... >_>
[21:47:25] <Krinkle> brbr
[21:47:30] * Cork pokes bot-t
[21:48:32] <Anphonic> I know I still have a lot to learn, been doing web stuff 15+ years off and on before able to do it full time
[21:49:06] <Anphonic> but I know I have a lot to learn and well, read read read, play play play, etc and before you know it, you've got it mostly figured out.
[21:49:39] <PressedWeb> Cork, Krinkle: Friggin' gurus... Always making me feel inferior about my code... :*(
[21:49:57] <Cork> PressedWeb: never feel inferior
[21:50:05] <Cork> take it as a learning experience
[21:50:15] <Cork> its how you learn new stuff
[21:50:20] <Anphonic> PressedWeb: Don't, someone always knows more and use it as drive to learn more
[21:50:37] <PressedWeb> Yeah right! I'm stupid and my eyes are set too close together!
[21:51:18] <PressedWeb> (  ._. )
[21:51:20] <Anphonic> PressedWeb: look at it this way, at work, i'm amazing and work magic with css/jquery
[21:51:21] <Cork> PressedWeb: if you really want to feel inferior go to a channel where the guys developing one of the js engins hang out
[21:51:27] <Cork> then you have a reason :)
[21:51:36] <tw2113> (  . ) ( .  ) ?
[21:51:45] <tw2113> *runs away*
[21:51:47] <Anphonic> here? I'm just your average joe who needs a hand and can sometimes give one. Makes me want to learn more
[21:53:01] <Anphonic> Cork: I like my small amount of noninferiouness today, so I think I'll stay out lol
[21:53:46] <Cork> :D
[21:54:41] <Cork> i guess its similar to when someone talks to the one developing the compiler for there prefered language :)
[21:55:01] <Cork> you alreayd realice how little you know
[21:55:16] <Cork> *always
[21:55:17] <coldhead> already* realise*
[21:55:25] <coldhead> always**
[21:55:30] <Cork> :)
[21:55:34] <Anphonic> Reminds me of hearing my dad talk of writing in machine lang
[21:55:40] <coldhead> ?hi5
[21:55:40] <bot-t> â‹°âµâ‹±
[21:56:06] <Anphonic> or seeing his notepads of binary, that he did for fun
[21:58:11] <Cork> notepads of binary?
[21:59:24] <Anphonic> yeah, this was oh, 25 years back?
[21:59:59] <digitalmediaguy1> Sorryâ€¦ I disappearedâ€¦ Yeahâ€¦ I found a tutorial for doing a "bi=directional infinite scrolling" but it was just for up and downâ€¦ and it was smartâ€¦ it loaded a max of three blocks/divs/pages/whatever to the page at a time so it didn't get get huge
[22:00:11] <Cork> Anphonic: i don't follow what you mean with "notepads of binary"
[22:00:34] <Cork> Anphonic: is it a binary he wrote by hand letting him take notes?
[22:00:44] <Cork> a note on the binary from notepad?
[22:00:46] <Cork> or what?
[22:00:48] <Anphonic> Cork: notepads he fill with binary writing code
[22:00:54] <digitalmediaguy1> urghâ€¦ I dunno where to start!
[22:00:54] <Anphonic> wrote by hand
[22:00:55] <Cork> ah
[22:01:28] <IgnisDiabolus> geek
[22:02:30] <Cork> Anphonic: i have a fend that as his master's thesis made an advanture game written in hex
[22:02:49] <Cork> he frightend me a bit when he converted numbers :D
[22:03:08] <Anphonic> designed our own satellite controller out of a "modern" touch tone keypad and other parts, used a regular receiver but you programed in the azimuth elevation etc in and the dish (c-band) oreinted its self
[22:03:20] <Anphonic> hahaha wow, more power to him!
[22:03:47] <Anphonic> wow, I cannot type tonight.
[22:04:02] <Cork> he could more or less instantly convert any number to hex
[22:04:28] <Anphonic> That, that is some mathmatical smarts
[22:04:31] <Cork> and calculating two three hex numbers was like; native :)
[22:05:28] <Anphonic> If math frustrated me less quickly, i suppose I could do ok with up to algebra lol.
[22:05:38] <Anphonic> but converting to hex in my head...
[22:05:58] <Cork> i love math my self, but thats beyond me by far
[22:07:18] <Anphonic> I started not liking it after changing schools, in pre-algebra the teacher said "now I know this is all review but..." in the previous school, we had spent the fist semester review basic math
[22:07:41] <Cork> ouch
[22:07:48] <Anphonic> me vs algebra = algebra > me
[22:07:56] <Cork> heh
[22:08:25] <Anphonic> little thing called pride, kept me from asking for help. Learned better since those days
[22:08:52] <Cork> heh never had the limitation :=)
[22:09:10] <Cork> i drove my math teaher mad one lecture cause i couldn't grasp what he meant
[22:09:21] <Anphonic> haha
[22:09:26] <Cork> he actaully let me go home and reset for the next day
[22:09:35] <Cork> and ya, he was right, that was the cause :)
[22:09:38] <raj> how can i collect all the classes for each element within a div and save it as json so I can use it later?
[22:09:58] <Cork> raj: eacg classes?
[22:10:02] <Cork> *each
[22:10:08] <raj> yeah
[22:10:11] <Cork> raj: you mean like the class attribute?
[22:10:16] <raj> yes
[22:10:33] <raj> some have multiple class attributes
[22:10:37] <raj> well, multiple classes
[22:10:39] <raj> one attribute
[22:10:54] <Cork> raj: $.map($('div').find('[class]'), function() { return this.className; }));
[22:11:17] <Cork> 'div' should be the starting element you want to use
[22:11:35] <raj> ok, trying it
[22:12:06] <Anphonic> Thanks for the reminder raj, I have to figure out how to collect data from a json feed and output it in Joomla.
[22:12:39] <raj> Cork, is there a beforeRefresh or beforePagechange event?
[22:12:49] <raj> oh wait, nm
[22:13:15] <Cork> onunload
[22:13:25] <Cork> or rather unload and beforeunload
[22:13:49] <raj> is that annoying to the end-user?
[22:14:00] <raj> to have to wait after they've chosen to exit?
[22:14:15] <Cork> you can't force them to wait with unload
[22:14:28] <Anphonic> it can be, as long as its not an unusually long amount of time
[22:14:28] <Cork> and not really with beforeunload either
[22:14:41] <Cork> you can't count on it
[22:14:45] <raj> oh ok
[22:14:52] <raj> well, that's no prob, i've got an alternative
[22:15:07] <raj> how can I reapply all the same classes to the same element?
[22:15:14] <raj> i mean, same elements
[22:15:23] <Cork> if the user clicks the close button on the tab you have no control except to ask the browser to show a dialog asking them to confirm
[22:15:34] <raj> yeah, i don't wanna do that
[22:16:01] <Cork> raj: do you have so you can identify the element?
[22:16:09] <Cork> adding classes is simple
[22:16:18] <Cork> identifying them is the hard part :)
[22:16:28] <aqeel> hi room
[22:16:29] <raj> i wanna replace all current classes with the classes i'm about to reapply
[22:16:49] <aqeel> use toggleClass()
[22:16:51] <raj> it's the same ('#mydiv')
[22:16:53] <raj> it's the same $('#mydiv')
[22:17:14] <Anphonic> ^^
[22:17:25] <Cork> raj: if you want to add it to #mydiv its just useing attr('class') or className
[22:17:35] <raj> right
[22:17:38] <raj> but the way we did map
[22:17:40] <Cork> raj: if you mean siblings to #mydiv you have a harder time
[22:17:52] <Cork> uh.. Ã„*children
[22:17:56] <raj> so that it collected all classes of each child within #mydiv
[22:18:25] <Cork> ya, you first have to have a way to mapp your saved class names to the respective element
[22:18:40] <Cork> and thats where it gets tricky
[22:18:48] <raj> k, so how can I collect it properly, so I can easily reapply?
[22:19:08] <raj> each element has a unique id #
[22:19:13] <Cork> ah
[22:19:17] <Cork> thats better
[22:19:46] <Cork> raj: $.map($('div').find('[class]'), function() { return {id:this.id, className:this.className}; }));
[22:19:48] <raj> in fact, it would be even better if I could use my data-cb-id
[22:19:54] <raj> attribute
[22:20:55] <Cork> raj: $.map($('div').find('[class]'), function() { return {id:$(this).data('cb-id'), className:this.className}; })); then
[22:21:06] <raj> ohh, i should be more specific. each <li> has a unique id
[22:21:19] <raj> there's also a <ul> element with no clsas
[22:21:20] <raj> class
[22:21:22] <raj> or id
[22:21:43] <raj> will that affect it?
[22:21:50] <Cork> raj: $(data, function(i, obj $('div').find('[class]'), function() { return {id:$(this).data('cb-id'), className:this.className}; })); then
[22:21:53] <Cork> bah...
[22:22:04] * Cork hates that ' is so close to enter >_<
[22:22:04] <padi> does anybody know where to find the irc for jasmine bdd framework?
[22:22:10] * Anphonic nods
[22:23:12] <Cork> raj: and to set again $.each(data, function(i, obj) { $('div').find(obj.id).attr('class', obj.className); });
[22:23:22] <raj> Cork, is the ul thing a problem?
[22:23:37] <Cork> as they don't have a class no
[22:23:38] <raj> in that it has no id or class
[22:23:44] <raj> k
[22:23:46] <raj> good
[22:23:53] <Cork> if you want to make sure replace find('[class]') with find('li[class]')
[22:24:11] <Cork> that should make the selector a little bit speedier too
[22:24:21] <Cork> (prob not noticable)
[22:24:39] <raj> also, what's $(data) ?
[22:24:50] <Cork> $.each(data,
[22:24:56] <Cork> the first was a stray enter :)
[22:25:14] <Cork> data is your stored array of class names
[22:25:25] <raj> wait, i think that confused me
[22:25:40] <raj> would you mind just repasting how to collect and then how to reapply?

[22:36:48] <Anphonic> SO what is the best way to pull values from a json query?
[22:37:08] <Cork> uh... query?
[22:37:21] <Cork> if you mean a json string convert it to a javascript object
[22:37:28] <Anphonic> yeah, that ^^
[22:37:34] <Cork> JSON.parse should do that for you
[22:37:45] <Cork> $.ajax and friends can do it too
[22:37:59] <Cork> $.getJSON for example
[22:38:02] <Anphonic> that's one thing i've been 'trying' to read on
[22:38:07] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/LmBz4/....................jailbreak.webege.com.hk
[22:38:30] <aqeel> sorry.....http://jsfiddle.net/LmBz4/............................jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[22:38:40] <aqeel> fiddle and site link
[22:39:19] <raj> Cork, everything is just undefined
[22:39:34] <raj> classmap = $.map($('#colors').find('li[class]')
[22:40:50] <raj> could $(this) be referring to something else since it's within a .bind function?
[22:41:12] <Anphonic> echo it to check?
[22:41:38] * Anphonic pulls back out of php
[22:41:41] <Anphonic> console.log*
[22:42:38] <raj> looks like it's Window test
[22:42:47] <raj> whatever that means
[22:42:51] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/LePDU/1/
[22:45:43] <raj> Cork, that looks like it picked it up :)
[22:46:00] <Cork> thats the miss remembering i talked about :)
[22:46:15] <Cork> ($.map doesn't set this)
[22:48:56] <aqeel> so how can i implement 2 routes on one button having two ocassions
[22:49:27] <raj> Cork, also, i didn't tell you it was part of .bind =T
[22:49:42] <Cork> shouldn't matter
[22:50:22] <Cork> aqeel: you could pick route through adding a class on the button
[22:50:36] <Cork> or inside the event
[22:50:52] <aqeel> but the class is clashing...
[22:51:23] <aqeel> if the button is off it does not have the class and clashes with when have the class
[22:52:33] <aqeel> no class.......toggle class on,class off......have class toggle class off.class on
[22:52:50] <Anphonic> when its is off, simply add another class to it
[22:53:04] <Cork> or use :not()
[22:53:10] <Cork> or .not
[22:53:23] <Anphonic> ^^
[22:53:23] <Cork> ?.not
[22:53:24] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[22:53:50] <aqeel> ok thanks giving it a try
[22:53:51] <Cork> ?.has is another option
[22:53:57] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery API - Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/
[22:54:02] <Cork> ?.has
[22:54:03] <bot-t> .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[22:54:08] <raj> Cork, any harm in having two chained binds?
[22:54:12] <Cork> bot-t: picky huh?
[22:54:12] <bot-t> Cork, Yes.
[22:54:38] <Cork> raj: not really
[22:54:47] <raj> Cork, cuz binding multiple events simultaneously is showing "click" without quotes around it http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[22:54:54] <Cork> each event listner bound to the dom makes it slower, but thats it
[22:55:02] <raj> and that gives me a syntax error in console with my custom event
[22:55:26] <raj> since my custom event has a . in it
[22:55:37] <Cork> raj: thats an object
[22:55:43] <Cork> .bind({})
[22:55:46] <raj> shouldn't objects have quotes?
[22:55:51] <raj> for the key
[22:56:01] <Cork> no, json demands it
[22:56:06] <Cork> but not objects
[22:57:50] * Anphonic has had a lightbulb go off as his brainpower dims
[22:59:14] <raj> Cork, basically, this never alerts http://paste.ofcode.org/KRsPQciii8JAvvVrFPu7xa
[23:00:00] <padi> Hi I have a question about making a jquery plugin work with jasmine bdd framework. It seems that a can't make toHaveBeenCalled() pass even if the function is indeed called. Here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/623ebb71090339f667b0
[23:00:06] <Cork> raj: and the custom event change_state is triggered by a plugin?
[23:00:17] <raj> yeah
[23:00:26] <raj> it's a custom event of the plugin
[23:00:36] <raj> as is load.jstree
[23:00:49] <raj> but they never said it could work with multiple events in 1 bind
[23:00:55] <raj> I just saw that in .bind()'s docs
[23:01:02] <Cork> raj: actually i'm not sure if you can use namespaces in object declarations
[23:01:02] <raj> perhaps it's not allowed?
[23:01:19] <raj> k, so just chain binds?
[23:01:34] <Cork> i can have a look if you give me a min
[23:01:44] <raj> of course
[23:03:26] <Cork> hmm weird
[23:03:34] <Cork> can't see a reason why it wouldn't work
[23:03:39] <Cork> the code is simple enough
[23:03:50] <Cork> ?src on: function( types, selector, data, fn, /*INTERNAL*/ one ) {
[23:03:51] <bot-t> Cork, No results found for "on: function( types, selector, data, fn, /*INTERNAL*/ one ) {".
[23:03:56] <Cork> O_o
[23:04:10] <katya^> probably a fairly simple question: can I use jQuery.each to do something for elemements that meet a certain criteria? I want to add an onclick event to elements generated programatically, and have it call $('body').load( the href of the link originally ) (reasoning, and tell me if i'm wrong, it's simpler than adding extra code to do it when creating the initial items)
[23:05:07] <Cork> katya^: you can but you prob want to use delegate instead
[23:05:15] <Cork> ?.on
[23:05:17] <bot-t> Cork, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:05:57] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[23:06:15] <raj> so Cork would you just suggest chaining the binds then?
[23:06:33] <katya^> well, I mean the main issue is getting the collection of elements that meet a certain criteria
[23:06:59] <Cork> raj: what version of jquery are you using?
[23:07:28] <raj> 1.7
[23:07:32] <raj> .1 i thikn
[23:07:35] <raj> think
[23:07:35] <Cork> katya^: the best solution to do that is to set a class on those elements
[23:07:49] <raj> or whatever the latest is
[23:07:52] <raj> i got it two days ago
[23:08:13] <katya^> Cork: so there's no way to say "okay, get me a list of elements which are children of elements of class .post" or something?
[23:08:50] <katya^> and specifically ,such elements that are hyperlinks
[23:08:56] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/Q25hW/ wfm
[23:08:57] <raj> $('.post').find()
[23:09:03] <Cork> so it sounds like its something else
[23:09:27] <Cork> raj: make sure the js parses and things like that
[23:10:17] <raj> you mean validate with jslint?
[23:10:57] <katya^> i'm not sure there's much point in using jquery.load for this since it's not really going to save on bandwidth, just reduce flicker a little
[23:11:36] <katya^> unless there's a better way
[23:11:51] <katya^> and then i'll have to think about reworking everything xD
[23:11:55] <katya^> bloody asp.net
[23:22:11] * Anphonic rubs his eyes
[23:22:18] <raj> Cork, it was loaded instead of load
[23:22:40] <raj> =I i'm driving myself nuts
[23:22:59] <Anphonic> raj: I know that feeling all too well
[23:23:01] <katya^> web development does that, it's normal
[23:23:07] <Anphonic> ^^
[23:23:33] <Anphonic> I had to restore our corporate site 2x today, stupid out of date components and trying to update them
[23:23:40] <Anphonic> fubared it 2x
[23:26:06] <raj> Anphonic, at least you get paid to fubar
[23:26:10] <raj> :)
[23:26:16] <raj> i'm fubarring all on my own
[23:26:18] <raj> for free
[23:27:03] <Es0teric> how do i hide all <p> tags in a container after the first?
[23:27:49] <raj> after the first what?
[23:28:28] <Es0teric> raj, i haveâ€¦ a div that contains multiple <p> tags
[23:28:36] <Es0teric> i just want to show the first one then hide the rest
[23:28:39] <raj> $('p').not('p').first() maybe
[23:28:46] <raj> $('p').not('p').first().hide() maybe
[23:28:58] <Es0teric> i see...
[23:29:00] <Es0teric> thats a start..
[23:29:10] <Es0teric> also - do you watch The Big Bang Theory?
[23:29:16] <raj> haha
[23:29:18] <raj> yes
[23:29:23] <Es0teric> lol
[23:29:24] <Es0teric> man
[23:29:28] <Es0teric> that show is so awesome
[23:30:24] <xec> raj: that looks horribly wrong - what would $('p').not('p') return exactly?
[23:30:57] <xec> Es0teric: try $('div p + p').hide()
[23:31:14] <Es0teric> xec, would that hide the others and just keep the first?
[23:31:34] <xec> Es0teric: in theory
[23:31:39] <raj> i meant not first p
[23:31:47] <Es0teric> alright, i'll give it a shotâ€¦ give me a min xec
[23:32:10] <xec> raj: i know what you meant, and what he said, i just don't see how your code would ever work
[23:32:39] <Anphonic> raj: I feel like im fubaring for free lol
[23:33:00] <Anphonic> and ugh, big bang theory? My wife loves that and I can't stand it.
[23:33:12] <raj> laugh track is too loud in that show
[23:33:38] <Anphonic> whats his face, the tallest of them?
[23:33:49] <patrickvw> Anphonic: The blond girl is nice :-)
[23:33:53] <Anphonic> yeah there's a guy like him, except stupid, in my oracle DB class
[23:34:37] <Anphonic> patrickvw: Yes, yes she is lol. but so is our new spokesmodel at work. All I gotta say is danica patrick? move over honey!
[23:35:09] <patrickvw> lol
[23:35:38] <raj> how do you say None in javascript?
[23:35:53] <raj> if (myvar!=None) {} ?
[23:36:01] <xec> undefined ?
[23:36:03] <Anphonic> null
[23:36:05] <Anphonic> ?
[23:36:41] <xec> raj: you probably also want !== not !=
[23:37:32] <Anphonic> depends on context, string: "" int: null (if my tired brain remembers right"
[23:37:33] <patrickvw> Question, Recently i began to use JsFiddle. The code is working fine in my browser but not in Fiddle?? Why?
[23:37:53] <xec> patrickvw: jsfiddle is in your browser!
[23:38:06] <Anphonic> patrickvw: are you using the correct framework?
[23:38:18] <xec> patrickvw: have you added the resources required?
[23:39:00] <patrickvw> Yep only diverence is the UI. My own script is 1.8.18 and in fiddle is 1.8.16
[23:39:14] <xec> patrickvw: have you added the jquery UI css?
[23:39:18] <Anphonic> <-- made that mistake while bleary eyes a few weeks ago. mootools onLoad != jquery ondomready
[23:39:39] <patrickvw> onload jQuery 1.7.1
[23:39:50] <Es0teric> man.. gotta LOOOVE css-> $('#recent_projects_container #projects_page + #projects_page').hide();
[23:40:17] <Anphonic> <3 siblings() too
[23:40:19] <xec> Es0teric: IDs are unique
[23:40:25] <xec> Es0teric: that looks like a mess :P
[23:40:34] <Es0teric> xec, how do i refine that?
[23:40:35] <Es0teric> lol
[23:40:56] <StevenCodes22> $('#projects_page').hide();
[23:40:59] <xec> Es0teric: use classes if you need multiple instances
[23:40:59] <StevenCodes22> lol
[23:41:30] <Es0teric> xec, yeah yeah yeah.. but thats not what i am trying to do here...
[23:41:44] <xec> Es0teric: your selector should never match anything
[23:41:44] <Es0teric> i thought i was supposed to hide the <p> but the <p> is inside #projects_page
[23:42:18] <xec> Es0teric: and there is only one #projects_page right?
[23:42:19] <Es0teric> xec, i am still trying to do the same thing i started with hereâ€¦ just now its id's instead of <p>
[23:42:32] <xec> Es0teric: you really need to learn HTML first, CSS second and then javascript
[23:42:33] <Es0teric> xec, I KNOW about ID's and classes.. i'll change that later
[23:42:37] <raj> xec, I'm passing in a string 'null' from my server so it can be compared to null
[23:42:54] <raj> since i can't pass in `null` (not the string)
[23:43:01] <Es0teric> xec, i have to learn more about HTML and css because i dont follow best practices?
[23:43:08] <Es0teric> the w3c validator wouldnt complain
[23:43:11] <raj> that was my rationale for !=
[23:43:13] <xec> raj: if you have a string "null" and want to see if that is what it is, use myVar === "null"
[23:43:14] <Es0teric> because i am doing this in HTML5
[23:43:16] <Anphonic> if (myVar !== null)
[23:43:27] <xec> or the other way like Anphonic says
[23:43:37] <raj> so !== ?
[23:43:42] <raj> or !=== ?
[23:43:47] <Anphonic> !==
[23:43:52] <xec> Es0teric: is #projects_page unique?
[23:43:58] <Es0teric> xec, no its not
[23:44:05] <xec> Es0teric: then i beg to differ
[23:44:05] <raj> thanks
[23:44:14] <Es0teric> dude it doesnt MATTER
[23:44:15] <xec> Es0teric: the validator would complain
[23:44:17] <Es0teric> ALL I HAVE TO DO
[23:44:18] <xec> Es0teric: it DOES
[23:44:23] <Es0teric> DUDE
[23:44:26] <Es0teric> ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CHANGE FROM
[23:44:28] <Es0teric> # TO .
[23:44:31] <patrickvw> On the internet you can find tons of examples on how to use sortable, but i can't find how to store and reload the order
[23:44:46] <patrickvw> so i build something myself
[23:45:18] <patrickvw> There is a problem with it. Is here someone who can help with it
[23:46:01] <xec> Es0teric: i'm not trying to piss you off, but you seem to make fundamental mistakes, and seeing as we can't guess how your page is structured we have to assume your selector is correct - which it cannot be
[23:46:03] <StevenCodes22> Dude Es0teric calm down lol
[23:46:38] <Es0teric> xecâ€¦ lets be real here
[23:47:02] <Es0teric> if i am doing the SAME THING i am doing with <p> at what point in time would you think that what i am trying to do changes?
[23:47:13] * Anphonic is going to be real... asleep!
[23:47:14] <Anphonic> night
[23:47:15] <raj> I'm trying to run $.each({{myvar}}) only if my template variable {{myvar}} is not 'null'
[23:47:32] <xec> Es0teric: if you're trying to do the same, why did you change the selector
[23:47:41] <xec> Es0teric: take a step back, and make a demo in jsfiddle, it's often more useful to show what you mean than to argue about it
[23:47:48] <raj> but even with an if statement preceding it, it throws an error within .each if myvar is null
[23:48:05] <xec> raj: can you make a demo too? :)
[23:48:08] <raj> how can I protect that?

[23:49:11] <aro> no you won't
[23:49:16] <StevenCodes22> lol

[23:49:18] <patrickvw> Can someone help with sortables
[23:49:22] <xec> it's not that hard to write a small snippet of html to show us, is it, Es0teric?
[23:49:52] <Es0teric> xec
[23:49:56] <Es0teric> give me a minute
[23:50:00] <xec> ok
[23:50:15] <raj> xec, http://71.232.89.204:8080/test
[23:50:38] <StevenCodes22> raj super slow
[23:50:51] <raj> yeah, well, it's running off my vbox
[23:51:19] <StevenCodes22> raj but good job
[23:51:27] <D4> How do I execute .fadeIn() only if the element is "hidden" previous to fading in
[23:51:31] <raj> haha, good job for what?
[23:51:37] <StevenCodes22> the little clicker thing
[23:51:39] <D4> i.e. don't fade in if it's already visible
[23:51:40] <xec> D4: you can use :visible i think
[23:51:49] <StevenCodes22> tree navs
[23:51:50] <StevenCodes22> w.e
[23:52:03] <raj> oh, i'm trying
[23:52:11] <D4> so $('.myThing:visible').fadeIn()?
[23:52:18] <D4> Or how are those :stuff used?
[23:52:21] <xec> D4: ye
[23:52:29] <D4> Thanks
[23:52:35] <raj> xec, line 1082
[23:52:42] <raj> $.each(null
[23:52:42] <xec> raj: what file?
[23:52:49] <raj> just go to the source
[23:53:22] <xec> $.each(null ?? you're looping through nothing?
[23:53:42] <raj> yeah, it's a template variable
[23:53:44] <raj> oh, crap
[23:53:46] <raj> fixed
[23:53:53] <raj> 'null' !== 'null'
[23:54:03] <raj> i had null !=='null'
[23:54:25] <xec> um
[23:54:38] <xec> it still doesnt make any sort of sense to try and loop through null
[23:54:44] <D4> xec » So, :hidden would perhaps be what I'm after since I only want to fadeIn if it's previously hidden? :visible didn't act as I intended, it didn't show the element at all ;p
[23:54:53] <raj> xec, it's not going to
[23:55:09] <xec> D4: yeah, sorry, of crouse
[23:55:11] <xec> course*
[23:55:15] <raj> $.each(null) ... here null will be replaced by something else if it exists
[23:55:26] <xec> raj: how?
[23:56:11] <One-Man-Bucket> i have a dragover event that i want to use to create a corresponding mousemove event
[23:56:21] <D4> Does .hide() have a callback function? So I can do .hide( function() { $(this).fadeIn() } ?
[23:56:31] <One-Man-Bucket> is there some way i jquery i can "clone" the dragover event?
[23:56:34] <xec> ?hide @ D4
[23:56:34] <bot-t> D4, .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[23:56:46] <Es0teric> xec -> http://jsfiddle.net/WQn7s/
[23:56:48] <One-Man-Bucket> like a deep clone
[23:57:00] <sj0bidoo> Does anyone know why this scriptsnippet make my page jump to the top everytime the loop runs to change slider of my slideshow: http://pastebin.com/V7U8iWvd   ? :)
[23:57:08] <xec> Es0teric: that HTML is invalid
[23:57:16] <sj0bidoo> The slideshow works fine..but it keeps making the page jump to the top on every slide :/
[23:57:19] <Es0teric> xec, i will CHANGE IT later
[23:57:42] <StevenCodes22> ?
[23:57:54] <xec> Es0teric: okay, then you can fix your javascript after that
[23:58:25] <Es0teric> xec, how difficult is it going to be to switch the js?
[23:58:27] <Es0teric> from # to .
[23:58:34] <Es0teric> this is jquery, not raw js
[23:58:38] <xec> Es0teric: it won't work with IDs
[23:58:42] <D4> xec » .hide() seems to be similar to .fadeOut() -- Reason I ask is because of this :: https://gist.github.com/435df4eeaa1e47e368a9  <--- The "problem" I'm experiencing is when the 2nd argument in that is true, it begins a fadeOut(300) then another for 600, so they, together, don't look so well. Any idea how I can modify it so it acts smoother? ;p
[23:59:21] <Es0teric> xec
[23:59:27] <Es0teric> give me a minute
[23:59:52] <Es0teric> xec -> http://jsfiddle.net/WQn7s/2/
[23:59:54] <Es0teric> there
