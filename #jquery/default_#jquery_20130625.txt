[00:28:14] <platinoid> Hey guys, Can someone point out where am i going wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/8bm9R/. I am trying to display a hidden textbox when a particular option is selected

[00:31:57] <seutje> platinoid: jsfiddle runs the script from the script tab inside a window onload function
[00:32:16] <seutje> this causes your functions to be scopes when not explicitly defined on the window object
[00:32:43] <seutje> because you are using the onchange attribute on the select element, it's being run in the global scope, where it does not exist
[00:33:23] <seutje> to be scoped*
[00:48:56] <dash_> Hello, how to pass data to template in jQuery-File-Upload?
[00:59:55] <seutje> dash_:  uploadTemplateId: 'template-upload',
[00:59:59] <seutje> downloadTemplateId: 'template-download',
[01:01:36] <dash_> seutje: ok but it's just ID of template to use, but I need to extend data which are sent to template for example add uniq ID of file
[01:03:58] <seutje> dash_: u need logic in the templates?
[01:06:57] <seutje> dash_: the file upload plugin seems to provide a plethora of callbacks and if all else fails, u can add logic to the template
[01:12:50] <eagspoo> In query mobile, is the idea for multiple pages that the footer be duplicated on each page?
[01:14:00] <_Jens> eagspoo: i think you'd have more luck asking that in #jquerymobile-dev :)
[01:14:07] <eagspoo> thanks
[01:21:15] <dash_> seutje: By overriding uploadTemplate settings parameter you can easily use template by calling tmpl(id, dataPassToTemplate) and also pass parameters by extending variable dataPassToTemplate, thanks for help, it works now
[01:21:46] <seutje> dash_: oh, nice
[01:38:10] <oberhamsi> regarding: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14045
[01:38:27] <oberhamsi> i am surprised .append() etc do not allow documentFragments
[01:39:51] <oberhamsi> i expected "htmlString or Element or jQuery" to include fragments since they are elements?
[01:40:51] <Stephan_> I have a quick question: I have a tr that has a .click event, but in the tr there's buttons.. if i click the button (inside tr) the click event is triggered.. is there a way when you click a button the tr.click event wont fire?
[01:42:41] <sacho> yes.
[01:43:07] <sacho> how are you binding the click event handler?
[01:43:30] <Stephan_> $('tr').click(function(){})
[01:45:45] <sacho> you could use event.stopPropagation in the button's handler
[01:46:18] <oberhamsi> is this supported: $elementInDom.append(documentFragment) ?
[01:46:24] <Cork> yes
[01:46:40] <oberhamsi> Cork: was that yes for me? :)
[01:46:43] <Cork> yes
[01:46:52] <oberhamsi> because i issued a bug and got feedback it isn't http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12392
[01:47:09] <Cork> $elementInDom.append(documentFragment), $elementInDom.append(htmlstring), $elementInDom.append(jqueryObject) is all the same thing
[01:47:31] <sacho> oberhamsi, documentfragments aren't elements.
[01:47:43] <Cork> $('htmlstring') will generate a fragment
[01:47:43] <oberhamsi> sacho: ! that's what i thought too. they are nodes but not elements
[01:47:58] <oberhamsi> and internally jquery takes a lot of effort to cleanly deal with documentfragemtns
[01:48:19] <Cork> well not a lot
[01:48:23] <oberhamsi> if you look at my bug report.. it seems i'm running into IE trouble which is internally dealt with by jquery.
[01:48:26] <Cork> but yes it has code to handle fragments
[01:48:45] <oberhamsi> hm, okay. i'm reading the jquery code related to fragments...
[01:48:53] <sacho> ok?
[01:49:22] <oberhamsi> depending on whether append(fragement) is supported or not, the bug is grave or not :P
[01:50:10] <Stephan_> @sacho thanks, got it working!
[01:50:25] <sacho> It's not supported, as the bug's handler mentioned
[01:50:31] <Cork> sacho, oberhamsi: check createSafeFragment
[01:50:43] <oberhamsi> sacho: i see, thank you. i thought so.
[01:53:56] <platinoid> So the problem is that I want a text-box to appear when a certain option is selected, It works when the select field has multiple options but when it is the only option the text-box remains hidden, Js fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/8bm9R/2/
[01:55:25] <platinoid> Any help?
[01:55:52] <Cork> platinoid: run the function on load too
[01:56:11] <Cork> and... don't use inline event attributes
[02:05:07] <pkug> i have a small app which draws graphic given some input, it grabs and handles the "submit" event and does everything on the fly, no URL parameters are used.. no i want to be able to link certain graphs which means i probably need to handle URL parameters but making it from scratch off the top of my head would require a lot of code i suppose.. are there any easy ways/good practices to handle this logic ?
[02:07:50] <_Jens> pkug: can you generate some sort of token to save the dimensions in?
[02:08:29] <platinoid> Cork: trie onLoad(), Not working
[02:09:17] <Cork> platinoid: $(function() { showField($('selector')[0]); }) something should work

[02:35:35] <ExxKA> Hi guys. How do I keep jquery ajax requests from following 302 redirect?
[02:38:43] <sfdcNoob-lunch> ExxKA: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10013812/how-to-prevent-jquery-ajax-from-following-a-redirect-after-a-post
[02:39:46] <ExxKA> sfdcNoob-lunch, I am more enlightened now.. But its a non-solution really :)
[02:39:50] <ExxKA> Thanks sfdcNoob-lunch
[02:40:27] <Cork> well it's actually not even a limitation in javascript
[02:40:43] <Cork> it's a specification in the xmlhttprequest
[02:40:44] <sfdcNoob-lunch> ExxKA: YW reminds me to change my nick

[02:43:33] <b0nes> hi guys can somesone help me on this?
[02:43:46] <b0nes> http://jsfiddle.net/M4RWt/
[02:43:57] <b0nes> its showing [object]
[02:44:05] <b0nes> instead of the actual object
[02:53:13] <Cork> b0nes: it depends on the console
[02:53:24] <Cork> b0nes: some consoles doens't display the content of objects
[02:53:30] <Cork> use JSON.stringify() for those
[02:54:42] <Cork> b0nes: also you're using arrays as objects; you should use {}; for those
[02:55:12] <Cork> ah, sorry read wrong
[02:55:13] <asher^> anyone know how to prevent a .focus() from triggering a click event?
[02:55:37] <Cork> asher^: make the element not focusable
[02:56:02] <asher^> im trying to focus the element, i just dont want it to trigger the click
[02:56:18] <Cork> those are two different things
[02:56:24] <Cork> both will trigger
[02:56:44] <Cork> click if you click the element, and focus if the element can get focus and gets it from the click
[02:56:49] <asher^> i mean im trying to focus programatically, not by clicking
[02:57:05] <Cork> .focus() shouldn't trigger click
[02:57:38] <asher^> hmm ok, maybe angular is doing it then. thanks
[02:58:32] <Cork> asher^: http://fiddle.jshell.net/nUyaa/show/

[03:19:36] <titii> Hi friends, i am using one custom plugin -> $.fn.liquidcarousel = function(options) { ... and here i would create my function - buildItems(), and how can i use this function from outer? $('#liquid').liquidcarousel().buildItems(); ? But this dont works. How it works?
[03:20:26] <Cork> titii: normally you would make it accessable through liquidcarousel('buildItems')
[03:20:36] <Cork> and have the main function proxy it
[03:20:48] <Cork> or you would have to return an object with the functions as a member of it
[03:21:06] <Cork> titii: widgetfactory might be interesting to have a look at
[03:22:28] <titii> Cork: i was inspiring with widget factory, but maybe not enough :) I have to understand it, but i dont know exactly what u men
[03:23:03] <titii> Cork: and widget factory looks else like that liquidcarousel
[03:23:58] <Cork> (function($) { LiquidCarosuel = {}; $.fn.liquidcarousel = function(name, options) { return LiquidCarosuel[name](); }; })(jQuery); kinda thing
[03:24:38] <Cork> (opps missed the var before LiquidCarosuel there)

[03:30:02] <Joe7> Q: Using DatePicker, the hover classes are not getting added anymore over any days. Any idea how can that go wrong?
[03:30:58] <Cork> titii: the way the plugin is written no function is exposed outside it
[03:31:32] <sfdcNoob> Joe7: which datepicker? http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ ?
[03:32:07] <titii> Cork: I see, so maybe its more problems to adapt it like make a function outside of this plugin
[03:32:28] <Cork> titii: well you need to expose it
[03:33:04] <skypce> hello
[03:33:09] <titii> Cork: it is hard?
[03:33:19] <Cork> titii: i already told you how

[03:33:59] <skypce> but in console returns me always 0
[03:34:09] <titii> Cork: i know, but dont know how to get it together
[03:34:11] <skypce> how can i do the opposite?
[03:34:22] <Cork> skypce: does #about have a scroll area?
[03:35:20] <skypce> Cork Yes

[03:52:24] <Olivius67> Hi there
[03:56:01] <Olivius67> question: I have an object with properties like obj.prop1, obj.prop2, obj.prop3 I would like to access obj.propx with x being a variable containing a number (in this case 1, or 2 or 3), does anyone know how I could do so?
[03:56:32] <progzer> Olivius67: obj['prop'+index]
[03:56:49] <Olivius67> ho array syntax
[03:56:58] <Olivius67> didn't think about it, thx :-)
[03:57:44] <progzer> Excuse me, I'd like to switch the (jQm) data-iconpos on clicking a particular element. I tried using .jqmData, to toggle between 'left' and 'notext' (in a footer), but the components didn't redraw.
[04:04:18] <boytoy> progzer: I think most people in here make their own designs and only use jQuery Mobile's structure CSS
[04:05:57] <Venko> Hey guys, odd request: I'm trying to transmit a large amount of data to a URL via POST. I have the data in this sort of format "var1=val1&var2=val2&var3=val3" but it cannot be transmitted via GET, it must be POST. Does anyone know of a JQuery library that will make this easier for me or will I have to make 200 odd hidden input fields on a form and submit that?
[04:06:52] <Cork> Venko: why not just $.post(url, { var1:val1, var2:val2... }
[04:07:43] <Layke> I'm using a plugin, and I'm not sure I can change some of the options on the fly... After I initialize it with default options, I'd like to be able to change the value of one of the options after init... This is what I'm using... https://github.com/aeberhard/redactor/blob/master/files/redactor/redactor.js
[04:08:42] <Layke> For example, based on a domNode, I'd like to alter one of the plugins objects properties
[04:11:04] <Joe7> sfdcNoob: yes the official jquery one http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ idd
[04:12:16] <Joe7> .ui-state-hover is not getting added to days, unlike on the examples there etc. It *used to* work, no idea what can it conflict with or how can one fck that up :)
[04:12:42] <progzer> Thanks boytoy. I think I found my answer - .trigger('create')
[04:19:01] <Venko> Cork: Does that return the output HTML from the url?
[04:19:26] <Cork> ?jquery.post @ Venko
[04:19:27] <bot-t1> Venko, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[04:19:29] <Venko> So I could just do document.value=$.post(url {var1:val1,....});
[04:19:36] <Cork> no
[04:19:41] <Cork> read the documentation
[04:19:48] <Venko> Alright thanks for the link :)
[04:20:38] <Venko> I do believe this is just what I need. Thank you :)
[04:21:13] <progzer> Hmm, I guess trigger doesn't work
[04:21:38] <boytoy> progzer: Damn
[04:23:19] <progzer> What's odd is the first time I try to read data-iconpos using jqmData, I get undefined. even though the attribute is set in the initial markup when the page loads.
[04:25:03] <boytoy> progzer: Sorry dunno mate
[04:50:17] <nysos> hello, i am totally new with jquery and was trying my hands with jquery ui but am not able to run a simple program, can anyone help me getting started.
[04:50:35] <nysos> http://pastebin.com/R9ejvcmE
[04:51:37] <nysos> http://pastebin.com/EwMbKwaT
[04:53:03] <sacho> please use jsfiddle to illustrate your problem
[04:53:34] <progzer> Can someone share some example usages of jqmData. The docs just link to the regular $.data method for usage but say use jqmData instead of the regular one.
[04:54:00] <Venko> hey, sorry just a follow on question: with the parameters to $.post()'s second parameter is it OK to have linebreaks between data? e.g. {val1:"val1",val2:"val2",...} is the same as {val1:"val1",LBval2:"val2",LB...} where LB is a linebreak.
[04:54:01] <progzer> My markup has certain properties, but when I try and trace them at runtime, I get undefined.
[04:54:11] <Venko> I have a lot of parameters so want the source to be readable
[04:54:19] <progzer> Venko, yes
[04:54:34] <Venko> Thanks. I thought it would be but thought I should double check
[05:11:05] <sfdcNoob> Joe7: u still around?
[05:19:42] <boytoy> Trying to make different slides have different heights at http://jsbin.com/evehis/1/edit -- but what's wrong with my customHeight variable? The slider stops working once I uncomment it.
[05:26:47] <Nancy2012> is there any plugin for uploading file with drag n drop feature.like this.... http://blog.asana.com/2013/04/drag-drop-file-uploading-at-your-service/
[05:28:04] <sammich> http://html5demos.com/dnd-upload
[05:29:08] <progzer> Eh? $.data correctly works, but $.jqmData doesn't return results on the same element.
[05:29:57] <arschmitz> progzer: the only thing jqm data does is allow namespacing
[05:31:10] <MariusIT> any ideea why the same code, dosen't work in real time implementation? http://jsfiddle.net/uwYgM/1/ on jsfiddle works great ...
[05:31:54] <_jgr> do you have the same version as on jsfiddle?
[05:32:16] <MariusIT> 1.9.1, yea
[05:32:36] <sammich> what doesn't work...exactly?
[05:32:37] <_jgr> work backwards from the paste
[05:32:49] <progzer> $.data($('#dynamic').children(":jqmData(role=footer)").children()[0]);  retuns an object.
[05:32:55] <progzer> $.jqmData($('#dynamic').children(":jqmData(role=footer)").children()[0]);  returns undefined.
[05:33:16] <progzer> Very odd.
[05:33:35] <MariusIT> i tryed to remove the css and i seem to get a one time trigger, the textarea slides up and that's it
[05:33:47] <sammich> why are they separate ready functions?
[05:34:43] <MariusIT> never tough to combine them :P
[05:36:06] <Nancy2012> sammich: my problem is that.. i cant use html5
[05:36:26] <Nancy2012> becoz of different browser compatibity
[05:37:59] <_jgr> make the browser compatible
[05:38:06] <_jgr> modernizr exists for a reason
[05:38:14] <sammich> polyfills*
[05:38:14] <_jgr> as does htmlshiv (ships with modernizr)
[05:38:19] <_jgr> ^
[05:38:57] <sammich> why are there two selects, Nancy2012?
[05:39:30] <Nancy2012> client wants this.. :(
[05:39:34] <Nancy2012> that is way..
[05:39:42] <Nancy2012> i found one..
[05:39:46] <Nancy2012> i think u would work
[05:39:46] <Nancy2012> http://fineuploader.com/
[05:39:59] <Joe7> sfdcNoob: around yep w some delay, shooot! :)
[05:40:34] <sfdcNoob> Joe7: u shoot
[05:40:44] <sfdcNoob> gimme some jsfiddle
[05:41:03] <seutje> opera is always so neglected in these browser support tables :(
[05:41:37] <sammich> wonder how many paid for jQuery plugins there are
[05:42:34] <Joe7> sfdcNoob: right, let me try to trim the fat off the page and copypaste the relevant stuff, gimme a min
[05:43:01] <seutje> haha, that fineuploader exposes a global object under the name "qq" :')
[05:43:29] <seutje> every time you call it, it feels like you're complaining about something silly
[05:44:10] <sammich> Nancy2012: I wonder if it's better to filter 'target' out, slideUp everything else
[05:45:09] <Nancy2012> sammich: i think i can use html5
[05:45:10] <Nancy2012> ;)
[05:45:19] <Nancy2012> so i have now alot of options
[05:45:35] <sammich> I'm pinging the wrong person :|

[06:02:56] <sammich> it's
[06:02:59] <sammich> I don't know
[06:03:00] <lord4163> Hooloovo1: I only find the link with the version name inside, I'm looking for a link with latest
[06:03:01] <Cork> ?g google cdn libraries
[06:03:01] <b-ot> Cork: Libraries - Google Developers → https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[06:03:01] <sammich> on
[06:03:03] <bot-t> Cork, Libraries - Google Developers - https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[06:03:04] <sammich> jquery.com
[06:03:16] <sammich> oh, latest
[06:03:17] <Venko> sammich: The only difference I can see is that it now freezes the browser whilst waiting for a response. It still doesn't execute any code in .done(function(result){...});
[06:03:43] <sammich> that's probably because it's waiting for a result
[06:03:54] <sammich> that's the syntax I use
[06:04:01] <lord4163> sammich: Do you know if there is a link for that?
[06:04:13] <Venko> Yeah but once it gets a result it unfreezes and then doesn't execute anything inside the done function
[06:04:46] <sammich> it should do
[06:05:57] <sammich> there are a couple ways of doing it http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[06:06:32] <lord4163> sammich: ?
[06:06:45] <Venko> sammich: I've been using that for reference. It doesn't seem to want to play ball regardless
[06:07:08] <granden> Hi, Anyone here who could help me with the jquery.cookie-plugin? I got a bit of trouble. When I try to do $.cookie('yearrestriction','yes'); on a click I get this error message. TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$.cookie('yearrestriction','yes')')
[06:07:25] <Venko> Unless it's not succeeding I guess :-\
[06:07:30] <granden> I have included the jquery.cookie.js before my js-code.
[06:09:07] <lord4163> I'm looking for //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/latest/jquery.min.js or something like that???
[06:09:58] <sammich> Venko: seems like the most obvious case. Check your network tab

[06:11:49] <lord4163> sammich: It's sad there isn't one :(
[06:15:45] <gandul> is there anything wrong in this code ?
[06:15:46] <gandul> http://pastie.org/8078626
[06:16:40] <sammich> extra $(
[06:20:09] <gandul> still doesn't work
[06:21:16] <sammich> {'margin-top':'-'+$height+'px'}
[06:21:41] <Olivius67> I define an object in an $(function(){var my_object = {...};}); statement, then later on the same page I try to call a method of this object from another $(function(){...}); statement and receive "my_object is undefined error". Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
[06:22:06] <gandul> oh ...
[06:22:14] <gandul> i removed both ( and )
[06:28:03] <seutje> `g javascript functional scope
[06:28:04] <b-ot> seutje: Functions and function scope - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope
[06:28:08] <seutje> Olivius67: ^
[06:28:24] <seutje> variables only live within the function the are *declared* in
[06:28:59] <sammich> this is a fairly common theme among all programming languages
[06:29:05] <sammich> fairly common *
[06:29:06] <c4ptnh00k> morning
[06:29:08] <seutje> if u want to explicitly put variables in the global scope, attach them to the window object (but please use a logical namespace)
[06:29:27] <seutje> like window.myApp.myObject = {}
[06:29:58] <seutje> lotsa ppl are used to block scope instead of functional scope\
[06:30:10] <seutje> all them Cs!~
[06:31:24] <c4ptnh00k> rule of thumb = never put a variable in the global scope if you can help it. As programmers we should know how to use functional scoping
[06:31:47] <Olivius67> seutje: thx, reading on mozilla doc
[06:31:49] <Olivius67> ...
[06:32:15] <sammich> but something has to belong in the window scope... (stops being facetious)
[06:33:01] <c4ptnh00k> sammich: what belongs there is already there
[06:33:07] <netiul> what is the recommened way to bind to click events on dynamically loaded a-elements from within a ui-widget?
[06:33:40] <sammich> I'm being facetious, you need something on the window scope, such as your first function
[06:34:10] <c4ptnh00k> netiul: depends. could always use $('selector').click()
[06:34:19] <netiul> i thought i would just do this._on(this.element, 'a', { click: /* stuff */ });
[06:34:46] <c4ptnh00k> sammich: Ah I see what you did there..
[06:34:49] <titii> Cork: hey, i change it, i think it is like u mean it. Now I have var methods = { init: function (options) {... and close: function (modal_id) {... but how can i read the variables from init in close?
[06:35:28] <netiul> c4ptnh00k, the selector is any 'a' inside widgets element
[06:35:30] <sammich> still trying to make sense of block scope, even having done C/C++ for 3 years
[06:35:34] <sammich> :(
[06:35:52] <Steve^> Some of my jquery UI widgets are being overwritten by a third party library that is loaded afterwards - is it possible to still access the jquey UI widgets, perhaps under a different name?
[06:35:54] <sammich> at uni, so I guess the lesson learned there was, 'pay attention'
[06:36:29] <seutje> c4ptnh00k: I often expose things intentionally in case someone else wants to override bits
[06:36:37] <seutje> bits I didn't think of making overridable
[06:37:25] <c4ptnh00k> seutje: and that would be bad practice. You can always just expose it to the outer function and let the user override that function and use it there
[06:37:47] <seutje> the outer function is an iife, usually
[06:39:11] <c4ptnh00k> There are some reasons people feel the need to polute the global scope and the very few who know how to do that the right way have a firm understanding of closures
[06:41:51] <seutje> that damn near broke my condescension-meter!
[06:41:53] <titii> Hey Friends, http://pastebin.com/ZXSXcsXV please check out the line 141.
[06:43:15] <c4ptnh00k> titii: pass it into the function
[06:54:01] <JosephDuffy> Hi everyone. Is it possible to use the sortable UI API to keep an <ul> sortable, but only draggable via a specific part of it (e.g. an image at the left of <li>'s)

[06:57:30] <sacho>  /msg bot-t help
[06:57:37] <sacho> Woops.
[06:57:57] <sacho> ?learn @ quanticka
[06:57:58] <bot-t> quanticka, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[06:58:12] <quanticka> thanks
[06:58:16] <sacho> there's also http://learn.jquery.com/
[06:59:24] <_jgr> api.jquery.com
[07:03:31] <_jgr> http://overapi.com/jquery/
[07:05:05] <sacho> that's old.
[07:07:39] <_jgr> I would just start reading through those, get some knowledge of what is available in jquery
[07:08:18] <MariusIT> now it's really frustrating, optimized the function a little more but still can't run it in browser, any ideeas? http://jsfiddle.net/uwYgM/4/
[07:08:27] <MariusIT> works on jsfiddle
[07:09:05] <jedimind> MariusIT so whats the problem exactly?
[07:09:11] <jedimind> if it works in the fiddle ...
[07:09:50] <MariusIT> idk why it dosen't run in my implementation, i was hoping i could get some ideeas about debugging
[07:10:05] <jedimind> check your console
[07:10:35] <MariusIT> firebug console empty
[07:10:46] <jedimind> it just doesnt function at all ?
[07:11:51] <MariusIT> yes, it's not firefox problem, does the same in chrome
[07:12:01] <jedimind> url ?
[07:12:30] <MariusIT> 2 sec
[07:12:54] <joker_89> how can i use json with utf8?
[07:13:24] <shoky> MariusIT: you're adding another 'focus' on each textarea, for each click on a .codebox
[07:13:39] <shoky> another 'focus' handler*
[07:14:23] <shoky> MariusIT: also   $this = $(this);   is wrong.  add 'var' to it
[07:15:06] <MariusIT> another "focus handler" ?
[07:15:10] <shoky> yes
[07:15:19] <MariusIT> allready has one by default?
[07:15:20] <shoky> on each click, you're adding a focus event handler to all textareas
[07:15:23] <shoky> no
[07:15:34] <MariusIT> i'm comfused
[07:15:35] <shoky> it has yours, and it has another one of yours on each click
[07:15:55] <shoky> first click -> you add a focus handler.   2nd click -> you add ANOTHER focus handler.   3rd click -> .. etc.
[07:16:22] <MariusIT> you're referring to "$this.select();" ?
[07:16:27] <shoky> no.
[07:16:34] <shoky> referring to:   $('.automarkup').focus(function() {
[07:17:31] <MariusIT> well the click is made on .trigger, not on .textarea
[07:17:37] <MariusIT> that's why i add another one
[07:17:44] <shoky> its made on .codebox
[07:17:45] <shoky> and so what?
[07:17:58] <shoky> on each click on a .codebox, you're adding one more "focus" handler
[07:18:00] <MariusIT> hmmm
[07:18:25] <MariusIT> you're write, i can eliminate it
[07:18:31] <MariusIT> thanks
[07:20:01] <jedimind> right*
[07:21:31] <MariusIT> ermm, i can't figure out how to remove that focus and keeping the id
[07:21:49] <MariusIT> *keep
[07:22:28] <shoky> what id
[07:22:41] <MariusIT> $('.automarkup').focus(function() {
[07:23:17] <shoky> just move the .focus outside of the click handler.. http://jsfiddle.net/uwYgM/5/
[07:23:41] <shoky> (that's not an id, btw)
[07:24:45] <MariusIT> aaaa
[07:24:48] <MariusIT> ok
[07:26:54] <MariusIT> thank you
[07:28:33] <_jo_> Silly question: why does (a in [a, foo, bar]) return false in Javascript?
[07:28:44] <_jo_> It seems like 'in' works correctly for numerics and strings, but not for objects.
[07:30:18] <_jo_> Hmm.  Nevermind.  Just looked it up.
[07:30:19] <dcherman> _jo_: "in" checks for the presence of a property in an object, not for the presence of an item in an array
[07:30:35] <_jo_> Ah.  Thanks dcherman.
[07:31:02] <_jo_> I'm derping with JS and Python at same time.  Wires crossed.  :P
[07:31:02] <_jo_> Thanks again.

[07:55:23] <elfman> thanks!
[07:58:10] <Nancy2012> any idea guys.. i m using html5 drag n drop feature for upload content.. but my problem is i have a popup where i drag n drop the file from my PC. but it works when u dont use popup(overlay window), and it wouldnt work on popup window.. any idea..?? i tried to use fancybox and now i m using the jquery core functionality … the problem is the same
[07:58:20] <Nancy2012> here is my code.. http://jsfiddle.net/fzzLp/
[07:59:21] <Nancy2012> my file upload content is loaded on the popup window… n when i drag n drop for uploading.. it wourldnt work..
[08:00:02] <Nancy2012> but if i dont use popup window.. which means.. i load the div on the underneath of page. then it work..
[08:01:37] <boytoy> Nancy2012: just my speculation but couldn't you add another drag and drop thing as an invisible opacity 0 layer on top of the popup?
[08:02:27] <Nancy2012> yes.. i can try this..
[08:04:22] <boytoy> also all usability experts I've talked to warn against popups. they say they're so 1990. 1) people must demaximize their windows, 2) load the folder with the files, 3) calibrate the browser window with the folder with the files to facilitate the drag and drop, 4) perform the drag and drop (with the danger of the file dropping elsewhere if you're sloppy, i.e. sensitive material could end up on your google drive etc.), 5) user must close folder with 
[08:04:59] <halcyon1234> .data() question: I'm stuck using 1.4.3.  If I give an HTML element the attribute data-some_id="1", can I do $(this).data("some_id") and get 1?
[08:05:14] <halcyon1234> Or is it a different syntax-- or does 1.4.3 just not autopickup data attributes?
[08:07:15] <shoky> halcyon1234: that syntax is correct
[08:07:18] <Nancy2012> i tried.. but doesnt seem work  :(
[08:07:33] <Nancy2012> i think it is impossible :(
[08:07:54] <Nancy2012> becoz i tried to use fancybox, jquery lightbox and few other lightbox
[08:07:59] <halcyon1234> Thanks, Shoky.
[08:08:07] <Nancy2012> but having the same problem everywhere
[08:08:08] <Nancy2012> :(
[08:08:11] <boytoy> Nancy2012: what about jquery mobile's popup? it's so simple
[08:08:18] <halcyon1234> Nancy: I missed the question, I know a bit about fancybox. Can you repeat the question?
[08:08:31] <Nancy2012> sure...
[08:08:46] <boytoy> jquery mobile changed my life
[08:09:31] <halcyon1234> boytoy: jqm is pretty cool. Haven't tried the latest version. Don't try to mix it with early versions of IE, though. It's like trying to get oiled cats to mudwrestle in jello.
[08:09:35] <Nancy2012> i m using html5 drag n drop feature for upload content.. but my problem is that i have a popup where i load a div holdingi do drag n drop the file from my PC. but it works when u dont load div on the popup(overlay window), and it wouldnt work on popup window.. any idea..?? i tried to use fancybox and now i m using the jquery core functionality … the problem is the same
[08:09:52] <Nancy2012> jquery mobile is maily for mobile edition
[08:10:16] <boytoy> halcyon1234: hehe
[08:10:53] <boytoy> Nancy2012: that's what most people seem to think, but really it's just a modernization of jQuery UI meant for the next generation of web apps
[08:11:53] <halcyon1234> boytoy: You have to compromise a bit on both sides to make a 1 codebase that works on both mobile and desktop, but you get a nice product by doing the whole site from JQM.
[08:12:03] <halcyon1234> Nancy:  The div with the upload, is it an inline div, or an iframe?
[08:12:10] <boytoy> halcyon1234: i wouldnt know i block all users with IE 9 or less.. they just make out a mere 5% of the traffic so..
[08:12:22] <Nancy2012> i m not using type
[08:12:34] <wcwrel> is there a reverse .each() ?
[08:12:41] <boytoy> halcyon1234: true that.. i found a nice way to serve different pieces of html/js/css to desktop and mobile though.. thank god
[08:12:47] <halcyon1234> boytoy: You don't block them, but you have to put some hacks in place. IE8 and less don't like the ajax navigation transistions, etc.
[08:13:16] <Nancy2012> sorry.. i m using type inline...
[08:13:20] <Nancy2012> wait. i show u

[08:15:42] <quuxman> is there anyway to get the dimensions of a background-image?
[08:15:48] <quuxman> or do I have to move it into an <img>?
[08:15:54] <halcyon1234> I wonder if the problem is that you're doing content: $("#dropbox").html(). I admit I haven't used FB for your scenario before.  Can you try one quick change...
[08:15:56] <shoky> wcwrel:  $( $(selector).get().reverse() ).each(...)
[08:16:16] <halcyon1234> Change the .uploadbtn into an anchor tag, with href="#dropbox", and remove the content: option.
[08:16:22] <halcyon1234> I'm curious if that works.
[08:16:46] <Nancy2012> suer..
[08:16:56] <TelFiRE> I haven't really seen this used before and it works in most browsers but in FF is saying that the variable is undefined. -- $currentForm = jQuery(event.target).parents('form'); -- Can anyone provide any insight?
[08:16:58] <halcyon1234> It may be that the content: .html() is duplicating or cloning your dropbox element, and putting it whoknowswhere in the dom.  Maybe.
[08:17:19] <Nancy2012> but.. should i use fancybox on it.. ???
[08:17:27] <shoky> TelFiRE: what variable?
[08:17:38] <TelFiRE> shoky: $currentForm
[08:17:41] <boytoy> halcyon1234: well i block them :D
[08:17:52] <TelFiRE> It's being called from a form input.submit
[08:18:07] <boytoy> halcyon1234: http://blog.chromium.org/2013/06/retiring-chrome-frame.html
[08:18:11] <halcyon1234> Nancy: It's hard to say if you should or shouldn't. If it works, use it. Otherwise mabye look into using the native jqueryUI popup.

[08:21:20] <halcyon1234> Nancy, which version are you using? fb 1.3.4 or fb 2+?
[08:22:06] <halcyon1234> Also, try wrapping #dropbox in <div style="display:none">, and remove the display:none from #dropbox itself.
[08:22:49] <halcyon1234> Is there a reason you're trying to do this in a popup, rather than just "click .upload, expand and scroll to #dropbox, drag and drop"?

[08:25:38] <Nancy2012> i have been trying since this morning to fix it up..
[08:25:45] <Nancy2012> and i really spent too much time on it :(
[08:26:15] <halcyon1234> Nancy: Sorry, I'm a bit stumped. I don't know the 2.0 version too well. Have you posted to the Facnybox google group? There's usually some pretty good responses.
[08:26:16] <halcyon1234> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fancybox
[08:26:32] <halcyon1234> Client requests. Fun. =)
[08:28:21] <Nancy2012> yes.. but my problem is not on fancybox
[08:28:31] <Nancy2012> i tried to use another lightbox..
[08:28:36] <Nancy2012> and having the same problem
[08:28:37] <Nancy2012> :(
[08:29:09] <Nancy2012> i think.. drag n drop file upload wouldnt work on popup
[08:29:16] <Nancy2012> it seems totally impossible
[08:29:17] <Nancy2012>  :(
[08:32:44] <verism> boytoy: I've been looking around for something to serve different code for desktop & mobile - can you elaborate?
[08:33:32] <halcyon1234> I think it's possible, it's just that most popups will do weird stuff with the DOM on the element they're showing. Have you used Firebug or something after the popup? It could be removing the elements from the form, for example.
[08:34:22] <halcyon1234> I really think that's the root of the problem: after the popup, the DOM's wrong, and the drop isn't going to the right place.  I'm not 100% sure how to fix it, but I think if you follow that lead, it might help.
[08:38:38] <Nancy2012> what lead???
[08:40:35] <TelFiRE> shoky: Sorry this took me so long.  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/kBIix
[08:42:15] <Nancy2012> halcyon1234: can i ask u something..
[08:42:21] <Nancy2012> if i dont use content         : $("#dropbox").html(),
[08:42:40] <Nancy2012> then it wouldnt load div content
[08:42:47] <Nancy2012> there is any alternative way
[08:47:42] <darkfrog> is there any way to measure the height of a container?  I want to know how tall the container needs to be to encapsulate all of its children.  I know I can write something to accomplish this, but I'm hoping that jQuery will help me out here. :)
[08:48:25] <jedimind> why would you have to set the height with javascript ?
[08:49:00] <darkfrog> jedimind: I want to set this container to be the height of screen unless it needs more space than that in which case it should create scrollbars (it's absolute positioned)
[08:49:12] <jedimind> why is it absolutely positioned ?
[08:49:13] <darkfrog> well, the container wouldn't create scrollbars
[08:49:34] <Eviltwin> darkfrog: You may also want to look into this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.scrollHeight
[08:49:36] <darkfrog> jedimind: I'm writing a web page builder
[08:49:45] <jedimind> http://www.pud.ca/misc/testcase/fullheight.html
[08:49:55] <jedimind> that doesnt explain why you're absolutely positioning it
[08:50:17] <darkfrog> Eviltwin: ah, that might help...
[08:51:02] <darkfrog> jedimind: it's a fairly complex system and would rather not debate how I came to the conclusion right now...just trying to figure out a solution to my current problem
[08:51:14] * jedimind shrugs
[08:51:36] <jedimind> im not debating because im bored, im asking because there are probably easier solutions to your problem
[08:51:37] <jedimind> but i digress
[08:51:40] <jedimind> do your thing
[08:53:03] <elfman> newbie - regarding the accordion widget,,   i asked this before, but seems to not work i want to assign lat and long coords to each section  ie each <h3> and grab it from the returned object im guessing ui.newheader . the
[08:53:26] <elfman> ui.newHeader
[08:53:32] <darkfrog> jedimind: I understand and can appreciate your point, I'm not trying to come off like a jerk, it's just a fairly elaborate problem and though mostly centralized about consistent coordinate systems it is more complex than that.
[08:54:00] <jedimind> darkfrog <3
[08:54:03] <darkfrog> hehe
[08:54:04] <TelFiRE> Is there a problem with this line in a function being called by a input button? It works well in browsers except FireFox, where the variable returns undefined. $currentForm = jQuery(event.target).parents('form');  -- Here is a codepen: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/kBIix
[08:54:53] <TelFiRE> And the FF error: ReferenceError: event is not defined
[08:55:40] <shoky> elfman: ui.newHeader.data('lat')
[08:55:52] <Eviltwin> TelFiRE: Do this instead: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ufBIa
[08:56:03] <Eviltwin> If you're going to use jQuery, use jQuery
[08:56:15] <Eviltwin> And please God never use the event handler attributes
[08:56:26] <Eviltwin> onclick="..." is evil
[08:58:21] <TelFiRE> Eviltwin: Really appreciate, will give that a shot. Yeah I would have approached this whole thing very differently, I'm coming in on it late :p
[08:59:00] <Eviltwin> elfman: By lat and long I assume you just want to be able to associate arbitrary data
[08:59:05] <Eviltwin> Not like move it on the page
[08:59:37] <shoky> he said before- <elfman> newbie -  this is more an html question , but i want to attach lat and long coordinates to <h3> tags, so i send them to a function when clicked on , how do i do that?
[08:59:45] <shoky> and was told to put data-lat and data-long
[09:00:04] <TelFiRE> Eviltwin: is the click function the only thing you changed?
[09:01:14] <defaultro> morning folks, which one is correct for disabling checkbox? .attr('disabled', false) or .attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[09:01:42] <Eviltwin> darkfrog: The latter is more correct
[09:01:49] <Eviltwin> * defaultro: ^
[09:02:01] <elfman> http://jsbin.com/umuquz/1/edit
[09:02:01] <shoky> .prop('disabled', true)
[09:02:02] <defaultro> thanks
[09:02:19] <defaultro> shoky: is that for me?
[09:02:20] <elfman> shoky => http://jsbin.com/umuquz/1/edit
[09:02:32] <shoky> elfman: check your html
[09:02:42] <shoky> elfman: don't you see the data-lat and data-long in the headers?
[09:02:55] <shoky> <h3>Section 1 lat="90" long"90"</h3>
[09:03:05] <shoky> that's not what i told you to do.. look again
[09:03:12] <elfman> ok
[09:03:55] <elfman> yep, sorry, im rusty, out for a few years
[09:04:04] <Eviltwin> Uh huh
[09:04:22] <shoky> defaultro: yeap
[09:04:48] <elfman> sorry guys, followed a different drummer for a while
[09:05:32] <defaultro> thanks shoky
[09:06:18] <defaultro> is something wrong with the disabling of an input button? I'm wondering why when I hover the mouse on the button, it is still reacting. I was thinking that once I added disabled, it won't react anymore. <input id="disableUserOption" class="btn" type="button" value="Disable User" disabled="disabled">
[09:06:39] <shoky> disabling means clicks are disabled
[09:06:48] <shoky> the action of the checkbox is disabled
[09:06:55] <poseidon> Is there a way for me to change the background color and color of a div, without animating
[09:07:08] <poseidon> Everything I search for leads me to color animation, but I don't want to animate
[09:07:44] <shoky> poseidon: .addClass() preferably..  or .css() works too
[09:08:18] <defaultro> shoky: ok. How can I make it look it's greyed out?
[09:08:48] <defaultro> btw, the .prop(disabled, true) for my checkbox worked
[09:08:50] <shoky> defaultro: disable it?
[09:09:15] <defaultro> now, I would like to disable a button  as if it's greyed out. I mean, like a regular image
[09:09:15] <Eviltwin> If you happen to set the variable disabled to "disabled"
[09:09:53] <defaultro> it's disabled but not sure why the image changes when I hover it
[09:10:25] <shoky> what image
[09:11:07] <sacho> the image, of course
[09:11:22] <shoky> ahhhhh
[09:11:26] <defaultro> i'm checking it now if there are 2 images
[09:11:31] <defaultro> highlight and unhighlight
[09:11:44] <defaultro> our QA testers might complain about it :)
[09:11:46] <shoky> defaultro: stop talking nonsense, we can't see what you're doing if you don't share it with us
[09:12:03] <defaultro> oh sorry, I was referring to a button
[09:12:20] <shoky> not really
[09:13:40] <defaultro> looks like it's not an image button. It's type=button
[09:13:51] <defaultro> so maybe a css that allows the highlighting
[09:14:38] <elfman> shoky , so when i try this, it says its undefined, how can i just see the value ?  : activate: function( event, ui ) { alert("hello " +        ui.newHeader.data('lat')      )}
[09:14:57] <shoky> elfman: i'm guessing your html is still bad
[09:15:52] <TelFiRE> Eviltwin: Hmm, seems like this isn't even submitting the form and I'm not sure why
[09:16:24] <defaultro> I didn't find anything in css related to hover, focus or webkit transition
[09:17:06] <shoky> defaultro: neither did we. it must be in your head
[09:17:29] <elfman> <h3 lat="90" long="90">Section 1 </h3>  ?
[09:17:39] <shoky> elfman:  and what did i tell you to do?
[09:18:00] <elfman> sorry i lost connection
[09:18:28] <shoky> elfman: go find out yourself, see ?data
[09:18:30] <bot-t> elfman, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[09:18:38] <elfman> ok
[09:18:40] <shoky> elfman read that link, all of it ^
[09:19:15] <elfman> got it, thanks!
[09:19:49] <shoky> quick reader
[09:20:02] <elfman> :-)
[09:22:02] <defaultro> maybe, this is the line that makes the highlighting, background-image: linear-gradient(#E7E7E7, #BFBEBE);
[09:22:21] <defaultro> when I hover over the values, i see the same grey colors
[09:22:36] <shoky> `demo @ defaultro
[09:22:36] <b-ot> defaultro: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:22:43] <defaultro> ok
[09:23:48] <DarkGhost`> anyone help me with tinymce?
[09:26:07] <defaultro> shoky: here you go. I don't want to affect other buttons. http://jsfiddle.net/kK9Hn/
[09:26:39] <shoky> defaultro: i thought you said there isn't anything related to hover in the css...
[09:26:51] <defaultro> i was wrong
[09:26:56] <defaultro> i saw it lately
[09:27:38] <defaultro> updated: http://jsfiddle.net/kK9Hn/1/
[09:27:50] <defaultro> how do I grey out disable user button>
[09:28:00] <defaultro> while not affecting the other button?
[09:29:07] <shoky> defaultro: here's one way  http://jsfiddle.net/kK9Hn/2/
[09:29:13] <defaultro> oh, I think i can do this, $('disableUserOption').css('background-image: "");
[09:29:15] <defaultro> looking
[09:29:35] <shoky> mm prolly not ideal the way i did it though
[09:30:02] <defaultro> got it
[09:30:12] <defaultro> it has more scores that's why it took precedence
[09:30:15] <shoky> especially as it wouldn't work if you switch the order of the css statements
[09:30:19] <defaultro> i forgot the css term :)
[09:30:30] <defaultro> which would not work?
[09:30:41] <shoky> i mean this  http://jsfiddle.net/kK9Hn/3/
[09:31:13] <sakurazaki> hello there, We are looking for a talented graphics designer for a website, we are willing to pay for the work and if we see you are worth, we might hire you for more future works. Pm me if interested :)
[09:31:21] <defaultro> oh, what would be ideal solution then?
[09:31:57] <danheberden> defaultro: i think you're looking for the work specificity
[09:32:01] <danheberden> *word
[09:32:08] <defaultro> yeah, that's it :)
[09:32:10] <Reck> Shouldn't this alert when I scroll on my webpage? $(window).scroll(function(){ alert('hello'); });
[09:32:35] <defaultro> but in shoky's example, specificity didn't effect
[09:32:45] <shoky> defaultro: do you care about IE<9 ?
[09:32:54] <defaultro> not right now
[09:32:55] <shoky> because otherwise there's :disabled
[09:33:12] <defaultro> what would be the code for it?
[09:33:27] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/kK9Hn/5/
[09:34:08] <defaultro> cool
[09:34:18] <defaultro> what about this code I am thinking
[09:35:02] <defaultro> create a new css entry say .disableHovering {background-image: ''} not sure if code is right. Then one our code, I'll add class
[09:35:19] <defaultro> one/in
[09:36:04] <shoky> the '' isn't correct css

[09:57:45] <winegoddess> i have to call a page that expects this format domino.com/?searchcriteria&foo=bar&foo2=bar2   where search criteria isn't part of a key=value pair.  would you recommend modifying the action to append the searchcriteria?  (there are two ways of searching so query is being used to modify the format)
[10:01:45] <Eviltwin> winegoddess: I'd recommend keeping it up front personally

[10:02:46] <winegoddess> i need to have it be domain.com/?searchcriteria&blah=1

[10:40:17] <Seb-> hey, are there any recommended alternatives to jQuery Mobile (for use with Phonegap)? jQM has flickering and bugs/performance issues on older devices. I'd love to be able to get a decent, simple UI
[10:42:27] <boytoy> Seb-: https://github.com/watusi/jquery.mobile.simultaneous-transitions maybe?
[10:42:57] <boytoy> or wait for jquery mobile 1.4. no alternatives as far as i know.
[10:43:19] <boytoy> Seb-: why u need to make it a native app in the first place whats wrong with mobile web?
[10:43:32] <boytoy> camera etc. will all soon be accessible via html5 so
[10:44:03] <Seb-> boytoy: because the app isn't supposed to be hosted on a server..?
[10:44:04] <TelFiRE> dabear: I know this, I didn't write it, but it is what it is. I have already tried several ways of changing it to be called from the JS instead, but can't get the function to call or call correctly. Open to suggestions.
[10:44:21] <boytoy> seems to me that whole native sphere is just an excuse for java developers to keep programming in java. the only real benefit of a native app is the extra publicity one gets from google play / the app store
[10:44:40] <defaultro> shoky thanks
[10:44:41] <boytoy> Seb-: so ur going native in order to save $5 bucks /mo on hosting?
[10:44:45] <Seb-> boytoy: the app connects to a device on the local WiFi using socket.io for realtime communication
[10:44:52] <Seb-> jesus christ you're an ignorant pessimist
[10:45:20] <boytoy> hehe
[10:45:26] <Seb-> so instead of developing a native app that clients can install, you expect me to tell them they'll need 24/7 internet access and pay extra for hosting
[10:45:31] <Seb-> because boytoy didn't agree with native apps?
[10:46:47] <boytoy> Seb-: dunno im just repeating what i heard in #phonegap
[10:47:09] <boytoy> honestly though im just looking for excuses to abandon my own phonegap projects, didnt mean to seed doubts in ur mind brotherman
[10:47:10] <Seb-> that's not even including the wasted space because of the browser's URL bar. on new devices, that's not a problem. but on older phones, they don't have too much extra space.
[10:47:50] <boytoy> true the url bar is an issue
[10:48:03] <Seb-> boytoy: nah, I was a bit too snappy. but yesterday I've had someone question my methods as well, while the method I was using was an absolute requirement because of limitations.
[10:48:10] <boytoy> and i think the majority of mobile phone users use old devices? so yeah good point
[10:48:13] <Seb-> instead of giving an answer to a problem, people just try to create more problems :/
[10:48:38] <boytoy> i feel u man
[10:50:12] <boytoy> Seb-: but yeah the flickering is the reason the latest jquery mobile has transitions disabled by default
[10:50:37] <Seb-> boytoy: the flickering also happens without transitions ;)
[10:50:54] <Seb-> fixed navbar + older device = tap the screen & the menu flickers
[10:51:08] <winegoddess> i am able to format the action to domain.com/?searchterm which i expect it to then ust add &foo=bar - but when i submit, it is getting changed back to domain.com/?foo=bar  is there a way to preserve this?
[10:51:32] <boytoy> damn
[10:51:41] <boytoy> Seb-: which older devices are we talking about?
[10:52:06] <defaultro> shoky: i got it fixed
[10:52:08] <Seb-> boytoy: GT-S5660, Android 2.3.6
[10:53:02] <boytoy> thats weird i've never experienced that. but then again im using the pure jquery mobile structure without any themes, made my own
[10:53:19] <Seb-> I do have an HTML5 responsive UI
[10:53:25] <Seb-> but that one is kind of made for desktops
[10:53:28] <Seb-> so while it works, it's not optimal
[10:54:02] <Seb-> I did notice Intel's App Framework
[10:54:04] <boytoy> cool
[10:54:08] <Seb-> and it looks incredible + fast
[10:54:14] <boytoy> yo winegoddess how r u doing mama
[10:54:21] <Seb-> but I can't find anyone with experience + no tutorials
[10:54:23] <boytoy> Seb-: i gotta check that out
[10:54:30] <winegoddess> hey there boy toy :)
[10:54:38] <Seb-> boytoy: app framework is the new jqmobi
[10:55:00] <Seb-> if you copy their code from github, the kitchensink looks awesome
[10:56:27] <boytoy> wow
[10:56:57] <winegoddess> boytoy: its been a while since i have had to touch form inputs, but there is a weird format where it is not based on key-value pairs, and I'm having a hard time getting it to that format.  its domain.com/?searchterm&foo=bar  - i can get the action set just before submit so it looks like this, but then it loses what i have after the ? and grabs the key=values...
[10:57:44] <Seb-> winegoddess: why don't you add hidden values to your form instead of changing your action?
[10:58:13] <winegoddess> the search is either of a catalog or the website - two different actions
[10:58:32] <winegoddess> but i think i may have found somethgin i can try - setting searchterm="" nothing…works on the catalog
[10:58:36] <Seb-> <input type="hidden" name="foo" value="bar">
[11:00:19] <Eviltwin> winegoddess: http://jsfiddle.net/67DK7/1/
[11:03:38] <Seb-> boytoy: tried Intel App Framework?
[11:04:02] <gandul> there is somethign weird going on with javascript in IE 8 on this site, it just freezes, if i disable js, it works.. how can i debug it ? http://www.bestinboating.com/
[11:05:25] <Seb-> gandul: so far, there's a 404 on that page. IE9 doesn't freeze for me.
[11:05:36] <winegoddess> Eviltwin: where shall i send you cookies??????????????????
[11:06:22] <winegoddess> that worked perfectly. i kind of thought i needed to initiate the change to the new window…but thought i could manipulate the vaue and let it handle it. i guess not?
[11:10:03] <gandul> Seb: IE 8
[11:10:11] <gandul> if you switch to IE 8 in developers mode
[11:14:44] <shoky> gandul: disable all the plugins... start enabling them one by one
[11:38:41] <defaultro> how do I prevent mouse or keyboard from going inside a text input? Even if it's disabled, I can click on it but not type
[11:39:25] <defaultro> looks like I may need to use a different event other than keyup
[11:39:44] <defaultro> what even would it be if text input gets entered with characters?
[11:39:48] <defaultro> even/event
[11:40:51] <defaultro> i'll try change
[11:41:55] <whistlee> how do I assign $ to jquery ?
[11:42:05] <defaultro> change event didn't work
[11:43:22] <defaultro> .change worked but it has to lose focus on the input box
[11:43:40] <defaultro> is there an event where we don't have to lose focus?
[11:43:44] <Seb-> defaultro: what are you trying to do?
[11:44:33] <defaultro> i have a textbox and a disabled Save button
[11:44:43] <defaultro> when I update a textbox, it enables the Save button
[11:45:09] <defaultro> i used .change event and it works after I remove the cursor out of the input box
[11:45:32] <Seb-> defaultro: .keypress?
[11:45:37] <defaultro> i don't like keyup because when I put cursor on a disabled input box, it enables my Save button
[11:46:06] <Seb-> .keydown + .keyup = .keypress
[11:46:22] <defaultro> i'll try
[11:47:08] <Seb-> do you have a textbox AND an input box? or am I misunderstanding?
[11:47:28] <Seb-> input is disabled, save button is disabled. typing in the activated textbox enables the save button?
[11:48:13] <defaultro> sorry, an input box
[11:48:31] <defaultro> i tried keypress on the disabled input box, it enabled my Save button
[11:48:49] <Seb-> then why are you hooking the keypress event to the disabled input?
[11:48:53] <defaultro> there are 2 input boxes
[11:49:08] <defaultro> one input box is enabled and the other one is disabled
[11:49:09] <Seb-> or why aren't you checking if $(this) is enabled inside the event?
[11:49:18] <jkoudys> Can $.removeClass() use a wildcard? I'm trying to remove all classes that start with a string
[11:49:26] <defaultro> ok, i'll try that
[11:49:49] <defaultro> i'll have to recode using coffeescript :(
[11:50:50] <Seb-> defaultro: I doubt you do
[11:51:19] <Seb-> jkoudys: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2644299/jquery-removeclass-wildcard
[11:51:35] <jkoudys> Seb-:  thanks! That's what I need
[11:51:43] <defaultro> i got it
[11:54:31] <culh> I need to keep updating a msg list (chat) and am using setInterval() recursevely, but it seems to be taking too much cpu and not respecting the interval I passed. What other methodology can I use instead?
[11:55:29] <Seb-> culh: you don't need to call setInterval() recursively
[11:55:46] <Seb-> only once, it'll then keep calling it until you use clearInterval()
[11:55:47] <eddiemonge> culh: use settimeout
[11:56:00] <eddiemonge> or even better websockets/socket.io
[11:56:11] <Seb-> but yes, socket.io is better
[11:56:43] <defaultro> Seb-: I'm very close. The disabled input box is not enabling my Save button anymore. Now I need to fix the event. Currently, it's keypress. When I press cursor up and down, it enables the Save button. I only want it to become enabled when a character has been added or deleted. The event change will work but only when we lose focus on the input box which is kinda confusing for a tester
[11:57:15] <Seb-> defaultro: on keypress, check $(this).val()
[11:58:00] <Seb-> or check e.keyCode/e.which
[11:58:13] <defaultro> k
[11:59:42] <eddiemonge> if ( this.value !== '' ) { $save.removeProp(disabled) } else { $save.prop(disabled, true) }
[12:02:54] <culh> Seb-: I'm calling a second function recursively, in the setInterval() like so http://pastebin.com/gv5PsTQg
[12:03:08] <culh> But after a few runs it doesn't seem to respect the interval anymore
[12:04:47] <eddiemonge> culh: i dont think you know what setInterval is
[12:04:52] <Seb-> ^
[12:05:47] <eddiemonge> ?mdn settimeout @ culh

[12:06:00] <eddiemonge> ugh
[12:06:30] <eddiemonge> culh: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.settimeout
[12:07:22] <verism> is there a way to prevent users hitting the enter button from triggering a form submit - but still allowing them to use returns in text areas?
[12:07:42] <Seb-> verism: .keypress(), if e.which == 13, prevent default
[12:08:12] <Seb-> although a multi-line textarea shouldn't submit the form anyway?
[12:08:17] <Seb-> by default
[12:10:15] <verism> thanks - i'll give it a go
[12:10:40] <verism> i figured a multiline area wouldn't trigger a submit - just didn't want to disable the key entirely
[12:13:41] <bartmax> verism: $('form').on('submit', function(e) { if (e.which == 13) return false; });
[12:14:01] <eddiemonge> verism: no, a return in a textarea doesnt submit the form
[12:14:27] <eddiemonge> disabling enter in a form is kind of bad ux
[12:14:51] <bartmax> eddiemonge: on intranet apps actually it could be pretty good ux. depend on context.
[12:15:01] <verism> eddiemonge: yeah, i'm aware of that - i only want the enter key to have a line return
[12:15:29] <boytoy> Seb-: yo, nope i havent
[12:15:30] <eddiemonge> bartmax: give me a use case for it.
[12:15:34] <boytoy> winegoddess: did u get it fixed?
[12:15:37] <defaultro> Seb-: I am able to capture e.keyCode now
[12:16:02] <bartmax> eddiemonge: a table edit where pressing enter key next to the current item on same field.
[12:16:04] <defaultro> however, what would be the values for acceptable ascii codes like for email address
[12:16:05] <boytoy> was away there
[12:16:09] <dsf> hi
[12:16:25] <joker_89> hi
[12:16:26] <verism> in my scenario, it's a shopping cart where users may enter different values for each item, but the total is automatically calculated - disabling enter stops them from leaving the cart page
[12:16:40] <joker_89> wichi is a good code for scroll down update in jquery?
[12:17:44] <bartmax> verism: yes, table edits ... is the most common pattern for disable the enter key functionability.
[12:18:05] <verism> ah, didn't realise it had a specific term
[12:18:10] <verism> thanks
[12:18:16] <bartmax> verism: it didn't i just make it up myself :D
[12:19:06] <eddiemonge> bartmax: thats not really a form.
[12:19:33] <bartmax> eddiemonge: yes and no. it's a form of multiple forms.
[12:19:42] <bartmax> which is not currently allowed
[12:19:48] <defaultro> Seb-: keycode is returning 0 for all alphabets
[12:20:22] <bartmax> eddiemonge: because you want to submit all data entered in one shot. but each 'row' is a form of it's own.
[12:20:28] <bartmax> or should be
[12:20:48] <bartmax> it's a common problem and there's no much solution to it. BUT, i can suggest another approach.
[12:20:56] <defaultro> e.which works
[12:21:16] <bartmax> instead of prevent the form submit on the enter key
[12:21:26] <bartmax> blacklist the items that should not trigger it.
[12:21:28] <eddiemonge> bartmax: in that scenario, you dont really want a form at all. just a bunch of boxes with event handlers
[12:22:08] <bartmax> eddiemonge: depends.. actually it's a form in the way that you maybe need all those input to be processed by the server
[12:22:15] <bartmax> eddiemonge: for data persistance or whatever
[12:22:30] <eddiemonge> bartmax: yeah, event handlers. ajax calls on blur or whatever
[12:23:05] <bartmax> eddiemonge: using ajax is a valid approach but you are actually submiting on enter (or blur) or whatever
[12:23:19] <bartmax> eddiemonge: ajax only 'shadows' the problem because there's no redirect but isn't a solution per se
[12:24:35] <bartmax> eddiemonge: using ajax without a form actually what you are doing is changing the way inputs works, in my view it's the same as altering the function of the enter key.
[12:24:44] <bartmax> both valid
[12:24:52] <bartmax> depending on context one could be better than the other
[12:25:55] <eddiemonge> bartmax: i could argue this with you but i dont feel like it and its mostly a matter of semantics
[12:26:07] <verism> bartmax: $('form') could be $('#form-id') right?
[12:26:10] <bartmax> eddiemonge: in that I agree 100% :D
[12:26:16] <bartmax> verism: sure
[12:26:26] <verism> hmm, then something's amiss
[12:26:32] <verism> it submits as usual
[12:27:30] <eddiemonge> verism: whats your code?
[12:27:31] <bartmax> verism: my code is on('submit') should be on ('keypress') I think
[12:28:30] <aro> is there an upload plugin that will essentially let a user select some files, click next to go to the next page, and have it start uploading on the next page in the background while they fill stuff out?
[12:29:17] <verism> same thing occurs
[12:29:19] <verism> odd
[12:29:51] <verism> jQ('#contact-form').on('keypress', function(e) {
[12:29:52] <verism>     if (e.which == 13)
[12:29:53] <verism>     return false;
[12:29:55] <verism> });
[12:30:02] <bartmax> this works:
[12:30:03] <bartmax> $('form').on('keypress', function(e){if (e.which === 13) {return false;}});
[12:30:23] <eddiemonge> ? preventdefault @ verism
[12:30:23] <bot-t> verism, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[12:30:37] <verism> of course
[12:30:53] <bartmax> eddiemonge: can you prevent default of sumit on a keypress event ? don't think so
[12:31:16] <bartmax> but im not sure
[12:31:55] <eddiemonge> no need to do it on keypress. bind it to the submit event
[12:32:14] <bartmax> eddiemonge: how to get the key from the submit event ? I didn't know you can get it
[12:35:11] <eddiemonge> bartmax: oh you might be right. im checking the event object for the trigger
[12:35:24] <bartmax> may I suggest another approach ?
[12:35:53] <bartmax> $('input.prevent-enter-key-submit').on('keypress', function(e){if(e.which === 13) {return false;} });
[12:35:56] <verism> i'm using the most convoluted development process atm - please bear with me
[12:36:17] <bartmax> and on all inputs you want to invalidate the enter key as submit, just add the class prevent-enter-key-submit (or whatever name you come up with)
[12:36:22] <verism> this approach i like the look of
[12:37:25] <bartmax> verism: this way, you can enable the code like global without affecting any form. and having the option to add a class to any input you want to prevent the enter submition.
[12:37:45] <bartmax> so you are doing it explicit
[12:38:15] <bartmax> which imo is quite preferable for this type of task
[12:38:46] <taar779> I'm trying to catch a 404 response but everything I've tried doesn't work! .fail() and setting statusCode in the config doesn't catch the error response … I'm not sure what else to try. My ajax call: https://gist.github.com/Taar/8e01a5334d6fc340f0f5
[12:38:57] <Eviltwin> bartmax: It'd probably be better to delegate that
[12:39:14] <Eviltwin> bartmax: $(document).on('keypress', '.prevent-enter-key-submit', function () { ... });
[12:39:23] <bartmax> Eviltwin: right!!!
[12:39:41] <bartmax> Eviltwin: way better
[12:39:56] <eddiemonge> taar779: did you try complete?
[12:40:16] <bartmax> verism: the Eviltwin suggestion only binds 1 event instead of 1 event per input. 100% recommended.
[12:40:16] <arschmitz> taar779: from the ajax api documentation for error "Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and cross-domain JSONP requests."
[12:40:22] <eddiemonge> i guess you tried it sort of with done
[12:40:58] <verism> ha - i was just writing it that way anyway
[12:41:02] <arschmitz> taar779: is your request cross domain?
[12:41:04] <bartmax> nice :D
[12:41:16] <verism> however, it's still not working
[12:41:20] <taar779> arschmitz: I completely missed that paragraph … and yes it's a cross domain request.
[12:41:32] <Eviltwin> taar779: Then you're somewhat out of luck unfortunately
[12:41:34] <bartmax> verism: console errors ?
[12:41:48] <verism> do both enter keys have the same code? - no, no errors
[12:41:57] <Eviltwin> taar779: A good JSONP endpoint shouldn't actually respond with anything other than status code 200
[12:42:03] <bartmax> verism: not sure
[12:42:07] <Eviltwin> taar779: And should have the "real" status code in the body somewhere
[12:42:13] <Eviltwin> Or at least an option for it to have that behavior
[12:42:48] <verism> n/m - doesn't work for either
[12:42:51] <verism> curses
[12:42:52] <bartmax> taar779: you can make a 'proxy' and make the request server-side
[12:42:54] <taar779> Eviltwin: Normally yes, but for this case it's trying to access static json files.
[12:43:07] <Eviltwin> taar779: Uh...
[12:43:20] <Eviltwin> taar779: Static JSON files that are just JSON?
[12:43:28] <Eviltwin> Not JSON with padding
[12:43:40] <bartmax> verism: don't know why :D
[12:43:49] <verism> jQ('#cart-form').on('keypress', 'input', function(e) {     if (e.which == 13) {     e.preventDefault;    };    });
[12:43:59] <taar779> Eviltwin: Yes. I have no control over this. They have to be static json files.
[12:43:59] <verism> anything obviously wrong with that?
[12:44:12] <Eviltwin> taar779: You can't change the format of the files?
[12:44:16] <verism> sorry, i'm ridiculously sleep deprived and probably missing something
[12:44:23] <Eviltwin> taar779: Add anything to them?
[12:45:16] <shoky> verism:  ()
[12:45:29] <taar779> Eviltwin: Yes but the url it built on the fly so the possible json names are endless. This is what I just wanted to catch the 404
[12:45:38] <taar779> url is**
[12:46:18] <Eviltwin> taar779: So using AJAX to fetch JSON and JSONP are completely different things
[12:46:41] <Eviltwin> AJAX allows you to request arbitrary data from URLs that satisify the same origin policy
[12:46:44] <verism> aha!
[12:46:49] <verism> thank you all
[12:47:04] <taar779> Eviltwin: I have to use JSONP since the files are cross-domain
[12:47:09] <Eviltwin> JSONP is a technique that allows you to circumvent cross-origin policies assuming you can control the format of the data there
[12:47:25] <Eviltwin> JSON looks like this: { "foo": "bar" }
[12:47:44] <Eviltwin> JSONP looks like this: myCallbackFunctionName({ "foo": "bar" })
[12:48:06] <Eviltwin> That function call is very important and is the only reason JSONP works
[12:48:44] <taar779> Eviltwin: correct, one of the json file looks like so https://gist.github.com/Taar/23b02da7a16719218353
[12:50:05] <Eviltwin> Okay, are you ever going to possibly be trying to fetch two of these at the same time?
[12:50:16] <Eviltwin> Two different JSON files
[12:51:07] <taar779> Eviltwin: No just tries to grab one of those files at once
[12:52:26] <Eviltwin> Okay, well you're not going to be able to get an error/fail handler for non-successful JSONP requests
[12:52:48] <Eviltwin> But this should work and you won't actually need to include the + '?callback=?'
[12:52:49] <chrispercol> hi, I am trying to load a datepicker function which doesn't fire from a javascript include...however if I paste the same datepicker function in the chrome console and hit enter the datepicker then works...any thoughts?
[12:53:12] <Eviltwin> But be warned that if ever two requests with the same callback name happen at the same time bad things will happen
[12:53:54] <dalnet22> anyone know why jquery would return an incorrect $(window).width() in my android phone's browser?
[12:54:24] <dalnet22> it's saying that my phone's width is 980px in both landscape and portrait
[12:55:11] <taar779> Eviltwin: It seems that way. I don't think I'll ever run into that issue since another ajax can't be sent until the current one is complete but I'll keep that in mind for future reference, thanks
[12:55:15] <eddiemonge> dalnet22: because its not measuring device width but page width
[12:55:53] <Eviltwin> taar779: JSONP is really designed to work where you can specify an arbitrary callback name as a parameter and it'll respond with a call to that name
[12:56:17] <Eviltwin> taar779: What you're doing here is really just loading a script
[12:57:32] <dalnet22> fixed it. I had to add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
[12:57:32] <Eviltwin> taar779: In fact you should be able to accomplish the same result with this: http://pastebin.com/9msHANGC
[12:58:02] <Eviltwin> dalnet22: Yeah, otherwise the browser pretends it has a bigger window
[12:58:36] <taar779> Eviltwin: Interesting, but would you be able to catch the 404 with that method?
[12:58:59] <Eviltwin> taar779: You can't catch the 404 with any method that uses JSONP
[12:59:12] <Eviltwin> Limitation of the technique
[12:59:26] <Eviltwin> <script> tags weren't designed to be used as a transport layer
[12:59:45] <taar779> Eviltwin: But the code you just sent me isn't using JSONP? Or is that a cross-domain limitation?
[13:00:03] <bartmax> jquery ui datepicker
[13:00:04] <bartmax> getDate()Returns: Date
[13:00:04] <bartmax> Returns the current date for the datepicker or null if no date has been selected.
[13:00:22] <bartmax> I have problem when model binding null instead of '' for the datepicker
[13:00:24] <Eviltwin> taar779: It is actually technically JSONP
[13:00:28] <chrispercol> how do I troubleshoot jquery not firing on doc ready to load a datepicker, yet if I paste the doc ready code in chrome console after page load the datepicker then works?
[13:00:30] <bartmax> is there anyway to change that behaviour ?
[13:01:23] <shoky> bartmax: wat?
[13:01:34] <taar779> Eviltwin: yeah you're right, it totally is just JSONP.
[13:01:40] <bartmax> $(element).datepicker('getDate') returns null when the input is empty
[13:01:57] <bartmax> so when i convert to json and send via ajax, the request looks like : date : null
[13:02:14] <shoky> $(element).datepicker('getDate') || ''
[13:02:19] <bartmax> ok
[13:03:20] <shoky> chrispercol: what does "jquery not firing on doc ready" mean
[13:03:46] <Eviltwin> taar779: This is a fully-functional JSONP: http://pastebin.com/YagVQ4Ra
[13:03:58] <shoky> chrispercol: are the inputs in the DOM already on docready?
[13:04:09] <bartmax> shoky: mmm still setting null
[13:04:18] <bartmax> current = $(element).datepicker("getDate") || '';
[13:04:19] <Eviltwin> Although usually with a delete window[cbname] in that anonymous function before the cb(data). Forgot that
[13:04:21] <bartmax> current = null ?!??!
[13:04:49] <boytoy> he'll be back
[13:05:01] <shoky> bartmax:  current === null   ?
[13:05:10] <boytoy> wrong channel
[13:05:19] <bartmax> shoky: debuggin .... let me see, looks pretty weird
[13:05:34] <croop2> HI.. i was checking this chart library highcharts.. i was wondering how does it shows in this example http://jsfiddle.net/wvT85/ the stackTotal in the tooltip option and if its possible to get a difference instead a total
[13:05:35] <taar779> Eviltwin: Huh, very interesting.
[13:05:44] <joker_89> hi i am using jquery scroll, how can i wait for the result of the first call?
[13:05:47] <chrispercol> <shoky> this is what is confusing me...if I run the my doc ready code in an include file the input and datepicker dont work...if I paste the same doc ready code in the console after the page has loaded the input and datepicker work
[13:06:29] <shoky> chrispercol: and my 2nd question?
[13:06:52] <chrispercol> the inputs are in the dom on doc ready, yes
[13:07:08] <shoky> chrispercol: then make a jsfiddle/demo/pastebin
[13:07:26] <shoky> chrispercol: that reproduces your problem
[13:07:53] <chrispercol> knew you would say that ;-) might be a job to reproduce
[13:08:03] <joker_89> :S
[13:08:04] <spobat> is .text() faster than .html() ?
[13:08:10] <shoky> no
[13:08:22] <spobat> html is faster?
[13:08:25] <shoky> maybe
[13:08:59] <mvpgraff> Trying to get two form actions
[13:09:01] <mvpgraff> http://jsfiddle.net/RTk9e/1/
[13:09:03] <croop2> any suggestion?
[13:09:06] <mvpgraff> does that seem correct?
[13:09:24] <spobat> it is just a <span id="a">info</span>
[13:09:33] <spobat> ^ what is the fastest way to get "the info" ?
[13:09:38] <spobat> .html() +
[13:09:42] <spobat> + = {
[13:09:44] <spobat> ?
[13:09:59] <BillCriswell> .html() would do.
[13:10:35] <mvpgraff> Hi NoiseEee
[13:10:55] <spobat> BillCriswell: is this the fastest way too?
[13:11:07] <spobat> this method is called like a thousand times :)
[13:11:18] <joker_89> anyone know how can i wait unitl ajax event it's done wiht a scroll page whih dinamically append new data?
[13:11:35] <spobat> jaequery: use callbacks
[13:11:53] <joker_89> me?
[13:12:16] <BillCriswell> spobat: this.innerHTML may be a bit quicker than $(this).html()... but 1000 times isn't much
[13:12:48] <shoky> spobat: actually maybe .text() is faster in that case
[13:13:01] <spobat> shoky: :O
[13:13:04] <shoky> but hardly, nothing you'll notice
[13:13:05] <bartmax> shoky: mmm... I have this problem, the object in javascript starts with null values for empty values. like { var1 : null , var2 : null } and when I post that using $.post() the request became var1=null,var2=null ... is that ok ? is the supposed behaviour ?
[13:14:36] <bartmax> shoky: im using knockout.mapping so I don't have all control of the viewmodel on the javascript object. actually i like it to be null on javascript, just want to omit them on the request at the $.post event. is that even possible ?
[13:14:41] <bartmax> something like 'ignore-null' ? :D
[13:20:42] <shoky> bartmax: "supposed behaviour" of what?  i dunno, i just build up my data object manually when i wanna send it, and JSON.stringify it
[13:22:50] <shoky> spobat: i said that only based on http://jsperf.com/jquery-text-vs-html/22
[13:23:44] <spobat> is this any pattern or is this just crap?
[13:23:44] <spobat> http://ideone.com/ZVMP1w
[13:24:15] <spobat> shoky: i stumbled upon that too and i think it's pretty clear about it :)
[13:24:42] <shoky> spobat: looks like just crap :P
[13:26:32] <BillCriswell> I got a lot of shit done not really helping out in here lol
[13:26:45] <bartmax> shoky: yes sorry. I found the culprit is ko.mapping ignore undefined but not null values, and I want to ignore null values also.
[13:26:51] <shoky> mvpgraff: that doesn't look correct, nope
[13:26:57] <bartmax> ko.mapping.toJS that is
[13:27:38] <spobat> shoky: alright
[13:28:13] <shoky> bartmax: yah i never got into ko.mapping too much, at least not for unmapping
[13:28:45] <bartmax> shoky: im actually thinking on mapping this by hand...
[13:29:08] <shoky> bartmax: that's how i roll, for now
[13:30:22] <joker_89> why it's imposible to use the scroll function and dind't do multiple calls at same time?
[13:31:02] <boytoy> At my click-to-expand kitten photo slider at http://jsbin.com/evehis/1/edit -- why won't "height: customHeight" update on the completion of the slideToggle of each kitten?
[13:32:22] <oojacoboo> anyone using jqui mask?
[13:32:25] <shoky> boytoy: 1st.. you set the height: customHeight once on page load.. and thats it
[13:32:48] <shoky> boytoy: 2nd.. that var customHeight in the complete callback is just a local variable in that callback
[13:33:48] <tankblergh> hi! I want to use fadeOut to make a div of mine disappear, but I want it to wait for 5 seconds before it starts the animation. What would the best practice be?
[13:34:11] <shoky> ?delay @ tankblergh
[13:34:11] <bot-t1> tankblergh, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[13:34:39] <tankblergh> ok, i'll give that a shot, thanks!
[13:36:40] <spobat> hi
[13:36:49] <gandul> i have a site, if you view it in IE 8 the content would just disappear and the browser will be stuck, any ideas why ? http://tinyurl.com/qd65kga
[13:36:50] <mvpgraff> shoky yea i already tested it
[13:36:50] <mvpgraff> :D
[13:37:05] <spobat> is there an event for "input changed" for a text input form field?
[13:37:17] <spobat> considering keypress, CTRL+V inserts etc
[13:37:26] <boytoy> shoky: hmmm i see.. so it should be a global variable in that callback?
[13:37:46] <shoky> boytoy: that would affect a global variable yeah, but it wouldn't solve #1
[13:39:05] <boytoy> shoky: interesting.. so i should find a way to reset customHeight after that callback then?
[13:39:55] <mvpgraff> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/RTk9e/4/
[13:40:00] <mvpgraff> that look better?
[13:40:01] <mvpgraff> lol
[13:40:14] <wcwrel> how can i get the input box that is currently focuseed?
[13:40:18] <wcwrel> if there is one
[13:40:42] <oojacoboo> wcwrel: :focus?
[13:40:49] <wcwrel> good call

[13:42:20] <boytoy> shoky: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2814325/reset-variable-in-javascript-jquery am i on the right track?
[13:42:52] <boytoy> if so ill have something to look forward to for tomorrow morning over a delicious cup of bob marley's coffee
[13:44:19] <shoky> boytoy: no
[13:44:51] <shoky> boytoy: if the plugin doesn't have a way for you to update its options.. yer kinda screwed
[13:45:29] <boytoy> oh.. oh no
[13:45:49] <shoky> boytoy: why are you taking  $('.slide').height()  anyway
[13:45:54] <shoky> that's the height of the first .slide
[13:46:37] <boytoy> shoky: i pictured it'd measure and set the height of each slide individually?
[13:47:02] <boytoy> so much for that delicious brew of coffee
[13:47:33] <shoky> ;P
[13:48:42] <boytoy> previous versions of http://slidesjs.com had an autoHeight feature though, dunno where that went
[13:48:44] <grafi> who wants coffee anyway ...
[13:48:44] <wcwrel> how do i check if the selected td is a part of the last <tr> in the whole table?
[13:48:48] <mvpgraff> shoky ignore that last one :p

[13:49:00] <boytoy> grafi: not tasty for ya?
[13:49:23] <grafi> nope :P
[13:49:34] <boytoy> =)
[13:50:08] <shoky> mvpgraff: 1. why do you have multiple options selected in a non-multiple select?   2.  what makes you think the .val() will be "value1, value2"
[13:50:32] <mvpgraff> well I need multiple options
[13:51:20] <mvpgraff> either way, I only used one value to test and it's still not working
[13:51:42] <il> in this jsfiddle:  (  http://jsfiddle.net/Jf4vB/32/  ), how can I get the text to go back to normal after 1 second of glow without an extra click?
[13:52:37] <wcwrel> how do i get the next input box after $('#ipt_1') ?
[13:53:00] <shoky> mvpgraff: if you select only one value then it definitely won't be equal to "test1, test".  you've answered neither of my questions
[13:53:30] <shoky> wcwrel: what do you mean by next?
[13:53:36] <wcwrel> taborder
[13:53:54] <wcwrel> or html order
[13:54:12] <shoky> no idea about taborder really
[13:54:12] <culh> I wanna build a js function assync to check for bd updated data, then send a flag to the user's browser. Where should I start?
[13:54:24] <shoky> and about html order, you'll have to say what you mean exactly
[13:54:27] <wcwrel> taborder IS html order (except if user specifies tabindex=
[13:54:47] <wcwrel> i have an input element and i want to focus the one in the next row
[13:55:00] <shoky> "next row"
[13:55:34] <wcwrel> i just want the next input element
[13:55:46] <wcwrel> $('input') gets a bunch of inputs in order
[13:55:54] <wcwrel> now i have $input a specific input in that list
[13:55:56] <mvpgraff> shoky 2. I was thinking that it would mean for both values, if selected then change action attribute. 1. dont understand the question
[13:57:26] <sysdef> maybe a small example would help
[13:57:33] <wcwrel> $(this).nextAll('input').first().focus();
[13:57:36] <wcwrel> does that do it?
[13:58:12] <shoky> wcwrel: only if they are siblings
[13:58:28] <myosotis> why not just use $(this).next('input'); assuming that selects the element you want
[13:58:33] <wcwrel> argg it seems like i'm going to have to iterate
[13:58:39] <wcwrel> and check my list
[13:58:39] <shoky> myosotis: that's only for directly next element
[13:58:53] <myosotis> oops
[13:59:00] <wcwrel> i need to basically grab all inputs and iterate until it is found and then grab the next one
[14:00:00] <shoky> mvpgraff: http://jsfiddle.net/RTk9e/6/
[14:00:22] <shoky> mvpgraff: you can't select multiple options in a non-multiple select
[14:00:55] <mvpgraff> oh
[14:01:04] <mvpgraff> hmm i see what you did
[14:01:13] <shoky> and .val() returns an array for a multiple select
[14:03:10] <bartmax> how to remove a property of an object ? let's say : obj = { name : 'bart' , lastname : 'calixto'}, how can i delete the property lastname ?
[14:03:17] <Gho5t> delete lastname
[14:03:22] <shoky> wcwrel:  var inputs = $('inputs');  inputs.eq( inputs.index(this) + 1 ).focus();
[14:03:23] <bartmax> Gho5t: ty
[14:03:41] <wcwrel> shoky, :thanks exactly
[14:04:06] <shoky> er $('inputs') is wrong but you get the gist
[14:10:50] <croop2> HI.. i was checking this chart library highcharts.. i was wondering how does it shows in this example http://jsfiddle.net/wvT85/ the stackTotal in the tooltip option and if its possible to get a difference instead a total
[14:16:06] <`teh1> If I create a jquery plugin, say, for an input, and I call this: $('.manydifferentinputs').MyPlugin();, is it equiv of calling MyPlugin on each inidividually, or is $(this) in the plugin a match to all the inputs
[14:16:16] <boo> Is there a way of getting the id of the object on which mouseenter just occured? I'm trying to do $('ul',this).mouseenter ,,, And I would like to set the first child ul elemenent of the selected ul to be visible..
[14:16:21] <`teh1> im thinking the latter makes less sense
[14:16:53] <`teh1> boo $(this).attr('id')
[14:17:04] <`teh1> inside the event
[14:17:15] <`teh1> handler
[14:17:35] <boo> `trh1 so $(this) inside the event is the element selected, not the global one, allright
[14:18:09] <`teh1> boo depends
[14:18:16] <`teh1> you can use e.target for the specific one selected
[14:19:13] <boo> teh1, so in the mouseenter case, I should use e.target?
[14:19:34] <`teh1> mouseenter(function(e){e.target})
[14:21:56] <shoky> `teh1: it highly depends on how you wrote your plugin
[14:22:22] <shoky> `teh1: if it's:  $.fn.MyPlugin = function() { return this.each(function() { .... }); }
[14:22:35] <`teh1> ohhh THATS how
[14:22:36] <shoky> `teh1: then it's on each
[14:22:38] <`teh1> okay =D thanks
[14:22:40] <`teh1> easy
[14:22:49] <`teh1> easy bulletproof fix
[14:23:25] <shoky> `teh1:  http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[14:23:47] <`teh1> ah
[14:23:58] <`teh1> the tutorial i read a few months back didnt have the each() bit
[14:24:07] <`teh1> thanks man
[14:25:04] <shoky> boo: this.id
[14:26:28] <boo> allright, thanks!
[14:26:47] <boo> shoky, is that the case always>
[14:27:14] <shoky> boo: that'll always give you the id of the element "this"
[14:27:41] <shoky> boo: but now i read what you wanna do, i don't see why you need to get the id for that
[14:28:12] <boo> shoky, what I want to do is to make the first child of the selected ul element visible
[14:28:21] <shoky> boo: $(this).children('ul').first().show()
[14:28:39] <shoky> boo: umm but.. you have a <ul> as a child of <ul> ?
[14:29:09] <boo> shoky, well ul is a child if li
[14:29:13] <boo> basically a dropdown menu
[14:29:37] <shoky> which do you want to show
[14:30:40] <display1> when you start you jquery script, how to create an immediately called function inside of it?
[14:30:42] <shoky> $(this).children().first().show()  will show the first child (the <li>)

[14:32:02] <display1> huh
[14:32:12] <shoky> display1: (function() { ... })();
[14:32:34] <display1> shoky, yes, can I put that inside a $(function() { ...} block?
[14:33:02] <shoky> display1:  you can.. i doubt you need to, though
[14:33:12] <shoky> usually it's the other way around
[14:33:28] <Seb-> jquery.mobile-1.1.1.min.js:59 - 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'c.replace'). What am I missing here (aside from the outdated jquery mobile, this isn't the issue)?
[14:34:31] <shoky> Seb-: jsfiddle/demo
[14:35:22] <display1> shoky, this is what I want to run http://pastebin.com/AE5wV7Uf
[14:35:46] <shoky> display1: ok?
[14:35:51] <Seb-> shoky: paid template, license doesn't allow copying. the error is in jquery.mobile-1.1.1.min.js itself so I don't know what code I should copy.
[14:36:05] <display1> shoky, but it crashes my browser and jsfiddle
[14:36:26] <shoky> Seb-: just cause the error originates there doesn't mean it's not an error in your own code
[14:36:55] <Seb-> shoky: I know, which was my point. I don't know what code to copy, since 1) I didn't write it and 2) error originates in jquery mobile
[14:37:07] <shoky> display1: then i guess you don't wanna run that
[14:37:28] <display1> shoky, yeah, maybe if I wrap it in the IIFE
[14:37:33] <shoky> display1: you're running an infinite loop that just adds more and more timeouts (a setTimeout doesnt block..)
[14:37:43] <shoky> display1: has nothing to do with an IIFE
[14:37:49] <shoky> display1: your loop is wrong
[14:38:01] <display1> shoky, oh
[14:38:12] <display1> shoky, just get rid of the while(true)
[14:38:17] <display1> shoky, thx so much
[14:38:25] <grafi> lawl
[14:39:10] <shoky> Seb-: can't help you, then
[14:39:35] <shoky> Seb-: you can look at the stacktrace of the error in the console to see where the problem might really be
[14:40:35] <display1> http://jsfiddle.net/gMvFF/ it only runs once
[14:41:14] <shoky> display1: you sure about that?
[14:41:51] <shoky> display1: oh oops
[14:42:13] <Seb-> shoky: how can I display the stack trace? I'm only seeing the actual error (Chrome).
[14:42:32] <shoky> display1: jsfiddle doesn't let you reload the fiddle, i guess
[14:42:46] <display1> shoky, I changed it: http://jsfiddle.net/gMvFF/1/
[14:42:54] <display1> shoky, but I can bet its working eh
[14:43:15] <shoky> Seb-: if there's a little triangle next to the error then it has a stack trace, you can click on it
[14:43:31] <shoky> display1: ew, no
[14:43:46] <Seb-> shoky: unfortunately, it doesn't
[14:43:48] <display1> shoky, what do you mean
[14:44:08] <shoky> display1: why would you want to reload on an interval.. after the first reaload, the page reloads anyway
[14:44:20] <shoky> display1: so you're back to the same page, but reloaded
[14:44:36] <display1> shoky, cause the page has an admin page, so people edit it, and they want to see the update
[14:44:37] <shoky> display1: also, using strings for setTimeout/setInterval is very bad practice
[14:45:02] <shoky> display1: but once you reload it, the interval you set is dead anyway (because you reloaded...)
[14:45:06] <display1> shoky, it was better the way I had it before?
[14:45:27] <shoky> display1: yes
[14:45:46] <display1> shoky, oh, you just need to reload it, you don't need an interval cause its reloaded.
[14:45:59] <shoky> d'oh
[14:46:15] <Seb-> shoky: I enabled every possible debug tool, even manually jumping through the code and now it didn't crash.. with it disabled, it crashes.
[14:46:37] <shoky> Seb-: sorry to hear
[14:46:46] <display1> shoky, so I don't need setTimeout either, I just need to wait and call reload()
[14:46:52] <shoky> lol..
[14:47:08] <shoky> how do you propose to wait without setTimeout?
[14:48:45] <display1> shoky, yeah, you said it was better
[14:49:08] <shoky> with setTimeout, yes
[14:49:14] <sammich> a big busy-wait for-loop sounds like a plan
[14:49:30] <display1> shoky, window.setTimeout(function() { location.reload(); }, 10000);
[14:49:41] <display1> shoky, it will only ever run once at a time, cause you always reload.
[14:50:44] <display1> shoky, but if I had something other than reload() in there, it would repeatedly do that block every 10000ms or whatever time you specified right, but in our case we reload the page, so it always starts back at scratch and never goes past 1 cycle
[14:51:03] <display1> shoky, but setTimeout is meant to cycle otherwise is what I'm asking
[14:51:11] <shoky> no
[14:51:17] <sammich> meta reload tag?
[14:51:25] <shoky> setInterval is the one that repeats
[14:51:28] <display1> shoky, only runs once? its just a wait
[14:51:47] <display1> shoky, cool. so its best to use setTimeout cause we reloading anyway
[14:52:00] <shoky> donno if its best, but its definitely better
[14:52:12] <display1> if I weren't reloading, and I wanted to repeat the block, then instead I would have to use setInterval
[14:52:22] <display1> ok I got it.
[14:52:29] <grafi> dolphinately
[14:52:31] <display1> shoky, thx man
[14:52:33] <shoky> or call setTimeout again when the timeout expired
[14:52:40] <shoky> (NOT in a while loop)
[14:52:55] <display1> well, the page reloads, so its get called anyway
[14:53:14] <shoky> you got it
[14:59:29] <boytoy> At this jQuery Mobile panel -- http://jsbin.com/ayulow/5/edit -- if you scroll all the way down, how to prevent the content from jotting back up once you load the panel by clicking "Click me"?
[15:00:51] <nerk> eek, jquery mobile.
[15:02:21] <boytoy> Or is this more of a CSS issue?
[15:03:42] <Seb-> boytoy: recommend not using jquery mobile
[15:03:53] <display1> shoky, I am putting an if(navigator.onLine) test inside, so now I better use setInterval eh?
[15:04:18] <boytoy> Seb-: how come?
[15:04:26] <Seb-> boytoy: it's heavy, slow, unresponsive
[15:04:32] <Seb-> and many others things
[15:04:42] <boytoy> Seb-: even the themeless one?
[15:04:50] <boytoy> Seb-: the 1.4 roadmap looks pretty bright though
[15:05:01] <boytoy> all those flickering issues you mentioned earlier are destined to be gone by then
[15:05:01] <shoky> display1: i dont think navigator.onLine is supported much
[15:05:11] <boytoy> and after all, it's jquery
[15:05:14] <Seb-> boytoy: that's too optimistic
[15:05:23] <display1> shoky, yeah, but I only need it to work on this single browser.
[15:05:27] <Seb-> it's jquery mobile, that's a bit different
[15:05:41] <display1> shoky, it doesn't work in FF but it works in Arora and Chrome
[15:05:44] <boytoy> yeah but it's the same bloodline if you will
[15:05:47] <boytoy> has the same name lol
[15:06:02] <shoky> display1: okz
[15:06:09] <Seb-> it tries to fix too many things and it sacrifices performance
[15:06:23] <Seb-> it's called jquery mobile but only works so fluid on a desktop
[15:06:36] <boytoy> hehe yeah true that
[15:06:54] <boytoy> but I trust you report all bugs you encounter to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?
[15:07:09] <Seb-> boytoy: I most certainly do not, I gave up on jquery mobile a while ago
[15:07:26] <boytoy> to me jquery mobile is great now, and it's only getting better. i spoke to some of the folks on the core team they said their main priority is slimming it down for 1.4
[15:07:47] <display1> shoky, but it failed! http://jsfiddle.net/FXPc8/
[15:07:57] <Seb-> it'll take more than one update to fix the main issues :)
[15:08:21] <shoky> display1: not for me
[15:08:38] <display1> shoky, let me make a test case then
[15:08:53] <shoky> display1: and remember that jsfiddle doesnt let you reload like that
[15:09:32] <boytoy> Seb-: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-planning looks kinda promising though
[15:09:35] <shoky> oh it doesnt let you only if you clicked Run
[15:09:48] <boytoy> Seb-: we need your help though so please dont abandon us
[15:11:10] <Seb-> boytoy: compared to alternatives, jquery mobile is one of the worst performing frameworks :)
[15:11:22] <boytoy> Seb-: not to mention what they've already done: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog
[15:11:34] <Seb-> I like jQuery, but jQuery Mobile is a long way behind
[15:11:56] <boytoy> Seb-: yeah maybe so but to me the glass is half full
[15:12:22] <boytoy> my app is pristine, so what if it takes a few extra milliseconds to do this or that, the average joe or jane i doubt will notice
[15:12:30] <Seb-> a glass being half full depends on the state of the glass before its new state: if it was empty, it is now half full. if it was full, it is now half empty.
[15:12:43] <Seb-> but in the context of jquery, jquery isn't even at 50% yet compared to other frameworks
[15:12:55] <Seb-> so while it would be great if they could improve performance, I don't expect it to be soon
[15:13:14] <Seb-> boytoy: with jquery mobile, you're not talking milliseconds
[15:13:28] <Seb-> you're talking constant flickering, unsupported (older) devices
[15:13:39] <display1> doesn't work
[15:15:02] <shoky> ?doesn't work
[15:15:03] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[15:15:31] <boytoy> Seb-: i must admit ive not tested it on all devices out there only browserstack where flickering is kinda hard to detect i guess
[15:16:39] <boytoy> Seb-: cool u raise awareness of this issue though im definitely noting this down
[15:17:33] <Seb-> I wouldn't recommend using jQuery Mobile but if you want to use it solely for "support", try cutting down on the transitions, don't use persistent navbars, etc.
[15:17:57] <Seb-> basically, use jQM without any of its features
[15:18:10] <shoky> Seb-: do you have the same complaints for jqmobile newer than 1.1.1 too?
[15:18:22] <Seb-> shoky: yes, I'm talking about the latest version :)
[15:18:27] <shoky> oks
[15:18:38] <Seb-> the 1.1.1 example was for an existing template, I just contacted the author
[15:18:52] <shoky> i was just curious, i don't use it myself
[15:19:19] <Seb-> I tried using it before, didn't work. used it yesterday and today again as a test and it was just as bad
[15:19:46] <Seb-> with a fully static page, on android 2.3.6 + phonegap, tapping the page (only had the text "Hello World") made the header and footer flicker
[15:20:05] <mvpgraff> shoky
[15:20:13] <mvpgraff> so i couldnt get it to work cause idk
[15:20:14] <mvpgraff> lol
[15:20:22] <display1> if you load a page, and then lose internet connection, why doesn't the page stay up anymore, it used to in the old days
[15:20:24] <mvpgraff> and went a different way that works now
[15:20:25] <mvpgraff> with ajax
[15:20:41] <shoky> mvpgraff: k ;] i dont really remember what your issue was anyways
[15:20:58] <mvpgraff> the two actions in a form
[15:21:07] <shoky> display1: maybe because you're reloading? :]
[15:21:10] <boytoy> Seb-: any chance this'd help? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5431
[15:21:15] <mvpgraff> D:
[15:21:35] <Seb-> boytoy: no it doesn't, I've tried all possible "fixes"
[15:21:40] <shoky> mvpgraff: o. changing action on a form should work fine
[15:21:42] <boytoy> oh lord
[15:22:14] <shoky> Seb-: is it the same with no phonegap?
[15:22:16] <mvpgraff> either way, i got it work with ajax, now i'm trying to do a redirect after the submit, so i had created a function so onclick would redirect, but the function is causing the ajax to not submit to the second action hehehehe
[15:22:24] <Seb-> shoky: it is even worse without phonegap
[15:22:28] <shoky> heh k
[15:22:36] <Seb-> phonegap = local files, so it loads stuff pretty fast
[15:22:48] <Seb-> so if you're using JQM, I'm assuming it might work fluid on the latest devices but even then that's just a maybe
[15:23:14] <boytoy> okay Seb- if you're as pessimistic come 1.4 im dropping jquery mobile for sure :)
[15:23:17] <boytoy> lulz
[15:23:37] <Seb-> boytoy: I'll probably keep following jQM to see if it gets better :) but I doubt it
[15:23:53] <Seb-> that being said, while I like jQuery, I often use an alternative as well
[15:23:58] <shoky> Seb-: what's your go-to alternative
[15:24:22] <Seb-> shoky: Intel's App Framework is fast. really fast. but I lack experience
[15:24:27] <Seb-> other than that, I develop my own UIs
[15:24:47] <Seb-> no frameworks except for lightweight js
[15:25:31] <Seb-> I'd love to use intel's framework a bit more
[15:25:39] <Seb-> even on the old android 2.3.6 I mentioned, it worked flawlessly
[15:25:52] <Seb-> switching themes, transitions, ajax, everything
[15:26:25] <boytoy> hmmm
[15:26:31] <boytoy> wait ajax has problems on jquery mobile too?
[15:27:01] <Seb-> boytoy: ajax works fine, what I meant was dynamically loading external pages with a transition
[15:27:04] <display1> shoky, it only reloads if there is an internet connection.  If I get rid of that whole block all together, I still have the same issue
[15:27:06] <Seb-> I just shortened it to "ajax"
[15:27:13] <boytoy> oh like that yeah yeah
[15:27:17] <boytoy> but man
[15:27:25] <boytoy> this intel thing looks hot though, thanks for the heads up
[15:27:45] <shoky> display1: what do you mean by "the page doesn't stay up anymore" ?
[15:27:48] <Seb-> intel's framework is awesome, I don't understand why not more people talk about it
[15:28:24] <display1> shoky, if I unplug the internet, after a min or so, intead of seeing the web page, I will see an error message, 'check you internet connection' or something like that
[15:28:36] <display1> shoky, it happens in firefox and chrome, but Arora keeps the page up
[15:28:47] <shoky> display1: and you're sure you're not reloading?
[15:29:05] <display1> shoky, yep, I got rid of the whole block for testing that behaviour.
[15:29:20] <display1> shoky, let me try again
[15:29:21] <shoky> sounds odd
[15:30:50] <arschmitz> Seb-: I see you have a lot of complaints about jQuery Mobile but say you dont file issues
[15:31:15] <arschmitz> Seb-: why dont you file issues we cant fix things if we dont know about them?
[15:31:17] <Seb-> arschmitz: they're mainly issues already filed and I don't actively use the framework anymore
[15:31:24] <display1> shoky, problem with arora is it doesn't go fullscreen.  Ok, I have the whole block commented out, and I have the page loaded on all three browsers, and then I am gonna disconnect and wait and see what happens.  brb
[15:31:25] <Seb-> so there's no need ;)
[15:32:17] <arschmitz> Seb-: ok well hope we can address some of these with 1.4 also note that the change log is updated as we go that is not a full list of things for 1.4
[15:32:36] <arschmitz> Seb-: every time we make a change we add it to the change log so we dont forget
[15:32:40] <display1> shoky, Yep, only Arora browser keeps the page up
[15:33:28] <Seb-> arschmitz: I'll probably test the framework again in the future, maybe 2 releases from now. for now, the framework is too heavy for mobile devices.
[15:33:42] <shoky> display1: adunno
[15:33:54] <arschmitz> Seb-: actually much of the "heavyness" is being fixed for 1.4
[15:34:26] <arschmitz> Seb-: we have changed the theme and eliminated Dom manipulation by 50%
[15:34:44] <mvpgraff> shoky http://jsbin.com/odidil/2/edit the redirect happens, but it causes the second post to not work... - _ -; the second post works if I remove the redirect,
[15:35:05] <arschmitz> Seb-: you also mentioned persistant nav bars i noticed these are fully rethought for 1.4 for true persistant flicker free navbars
[15:35:23] <Seb-> arschmitz: I noticed you're going to use benchmarks now, that might help :) have you ever had the chance to try intel's framework?
[15:35:44] <arschmitz> Seb-: we actually have people from intel who work on jQuery Mobile
[15:36:10] <shoky> mvpgraff: then put the redirect in the callback for the 2nd post?
[15:36:57] <arschmitz> Seb-: we are also adding options to be able to essentially eliminate all dom manipulation by sending pre enhanced content
[15:37:51] <Seb-> arschmitz: ah, that's an important feature. especially for phonegap apps, I assume it'll speed it up noticeably?
[15:38:27] <arschmitz> Seb-: yes dom manipulation is the heaviest operation you can do on a page generally
[15:38:45] <girsnoopy> Hey guys, can anyone tell me how to get icons in a nav menu to align to the left? Im not having any luck and ive tried many methods.
[15:39:08] <girsnoopy> the icons keep appearing above the text for each unordred list item
[15:39:16] <arschmitz> Seb-: one sad downside of phonegap is that for some reason phone makes have decided to basicly handicap webviews
[15:39:36] <arschmitz> Seb-: on average a webview runs js at 1/2 the speed of the phones normal browser
[15:39:49] <shoky> seriously?
[15:39:58] <Seb-> I've noticed as well, although 1/2 is a bit of an exaggeration
[15:40:03] <shoky> that sounds very lame
[15:40:03] <Seb-> maybe 70 - 80% :)
[15:40:05] <jkoudys> Is there a way to just update the entire class set, not using addClass/removeClass. As in 'replace the current class="" with this string' ?
[15:40:09] <arschmitz> Seb-: nope thats from actual tests
[15:40:18] <arschmitz> it averages 50%
[15:40:42] <arschmitz> Seb-: though iv never seen a reason why phone makers do this
[15:40:46] <Seb-> arschmitz: from my tests with multiple frameworks, it seemed like 70-ish, but I could have just been lucky
[15:40:47] <shoky> jkoudys: .attr('class', 'bla')
[15:41:06] <jkoudys> oh that's straightforward
[15:41:06] <arschmitz> Seb-: yeah and either way thats a major handicap
[15:41:13] <jkoudys> shoky:  thanks
[15:41:57] <Seb-> arschmitz: iirc, I read something about having set a low target SDK version
[15:42:13] <Seb-> which lets newer devices scale back and disable some features that improve performance
[15:42:23] <Seb-> (if you didn't set the target SDK to a high version *)
[15:43:39] <girsnoopy> <li><a href="hotels.php"><i align="left" class="ui-icon-hanger"></i> Hotels & Rentals</a></li> is making my icon appear above the text not to the left. Any idea whats wrong?
[15:44:06] <Seb-> girsnoopy: using framework?
[15:44:21] <girsnoopy> Im using jQuery 1.3.1 but I am new to the framework
[15:44:50] <girsnoopy> *mobile
[15:44:55] <Seb-> ah :)
[15:45:08] <arschmitz> Seb-: anyway we are working hard to improve performance and we be very welcome to any suggestions you have in addition to what we are doing already
[15:45:30] <Seb-> girsnoopy: data-iconpos ?
[15:46:39] <Seb-> arschmitz: I'm a performance guy. if a framework needs anything, it's speed and optimal code, not fancy features :) because I can write my own code to add the fancy things but I can't rewrite the entire framework to make it faster
[15:47:21] <girsnoopy> yeah ive tried that, Im not sure if it should go in an <i> tag or not but thats how stanfords mobile page does it, im trying to mimic them.
[15:47:30] <girsnoopy> still doesnt seem to work
[15:47:43] <arschmitz> Seb-: another thing not sure if you have done this already but using the download builder to slim down or remove uneeded pieces is something we very much advice
[15:48:51] <Seb-> girsnoopy
[15:48:52] <Seb-> <li><a href="hotels.php" class="ui-icon-hanger">Hotels & Rentals</a></li>
[15:49:19] <Seb-> arschmitz: I have :)
[15:49:41] <Seb-> although theoretically, filesize shouldn't decrease performance once the file is loaded
[15:49:47] <Seb-> and on phonegap, it's a local file, so it should be fast
[15:50:08] <arschmitz> Seb-: actually thats not entirely true you have to consider the time to run all the extra code
[15:50:33] <arschmitz> every widget needs to be initalized and every widget needs to search a page when loaded to see what elements need to be enhanced
[15:51:25] <Seb-> well, true, but that's initialization
[15:51:39] <Seb-> I should note I usually prefetch my pages if I have them externally
[15:51:46] <Seb-> (in phonegap apps)
[15:51:53] <arschmitz> Seb-: if you have done much with JQM performance you will have noticed currently our biggest bottle neck is buttonMarkup
[15:52:47] <arschmitz> Seb-: buttonMarkup has essentially been eliminated in 1.4 there are no wrappers for buttons any longer and no inner elements are added
[15:54:10] <beshoo> how can i use keypress on JQM
[15:54:23] <Seb-> beshoo: jQM = UI
[15:54:28] <Seb-> arschmitz: you also said something about persistent navbars?
[15:54:33] <arschmitz> Yes
[15:54:38] <beshoo> $('#_phone_number').on('keypress, keydown', function(event) {....}
[15:54:45] <arschmitz> now you can place the tolbar outside the page
[15:54:49] <beshoo> on PC , it works
[15:54:56] <beshoo> but on mobile it is not !
[15:55:10] <arschmitz> and it will maintain as forever until you remove it
[15:55:21] <arschmitz> and being outside the page its not effected by trnasitions
[15:56:00] <arschmitz> Seb-: so its truly persistent instead of faking it
[15:56:09] <Seb-> true, that'll help with transitions :P
[15:56:19] <arschmitz> it also improves page load speed
[15:56:27] <arschmitz> because you only need to send on inital page load
[15:56:31] <beshoo> please advice ?
[15:56:37] <arschmitz> and after that you can send JUST the page div
[15:56:49] <Seb-> btw, on android 2.3.6 (GT-S5660) + phonegap, fixed navbar didn't work either. when not in fullscreen mode, you couldn't make it disappear. when in fullscreen mode, it just disappeared & came back without transition
[15:56:53] <Joe7> hi
[15:56:58] <Seb-> I'm not sure if there's an issue for that on github
[15:57:06] <beshoo> <Seb-> so i can not do it ?
[15:57:25] <Seb-> beshoo: desktop & mobile are the same files?
[15:57:31] <beshoo> yes
[15:57:33] <mvpgraff> shoky
[15:57:41] <Seb-> if so, it should both work. are you sure you loaded all your js files as well and didn't forget one on mobile?
[15:57:41] <mvpgraff> found out I was just missing a ,
[15:57:42] <mvpgraff> D:
[15:57:49] <arschmitz> you will also be able to place panels and popups outside the pages so you dont need to place these in every page less download and less to initalize
[15:58:17] <Joe7> dear knights of Js: http://jsfiddle.net/xdS8f/ <- can u tell me pls how to get that to validate _all_ inputs, all 2 shown and the extra ones after clickin 'add extra input' too?
[15:58:34] <beshoo> yes i am sure
[15:58:54] <beshoo> it just dos not hock the mobile keyboard
[15:59:06] <Seb-> Joe7: $('input') ?
[15:59:21] <beshoo> $('#_phone_number').on('keypress, keydown', function(event) {
[15:59:55] <Seb-> beshoo: try: $('...').keypress(function(){});
[15:59:57] <beshoo> $(window).load(function(){  $('#_phone_number').on('keypress, keydown', function(event) {} }
[16:00:18] <Joe7> Seb-: can that get away with multiple/array matches? Had the impression I'd need to do an each..just like I do in the js there
[16:02:48] <Seb-> Joe7: yes, you'd have to use each
[16:02:51] <Seb-> what is not working exactly?
[16:04:15] <Seb-> oh, I see what you mean
[16:04:35] <Seb-> but that's because you loop over them in init()
[16:04:48] <Seb-> and you don't add rules to new input forms
[16:05:12] <Seb-> wait, I just noticed your addAddress() calling init() o.o
[16:07:02] <Seb-> Joe7
[16:08:04] <Seb-> your validation works, I'm not sure what's not working? when you add new inputs, you all add them with the same name. so while validation will work on all of them, you'll only see the output behind the first input
[16:08:55] <mvpgraff> i hate commas :l
[16:09:49] <blindMoe> f'ing commas
[16:10:13] <blindMoe> I am working with a csv file right now that I have to convert that has 700,000 lines ... I am _really_ hating commas right now ;)
[16:10:28] <sammichToo> regex if your friend
[16:10:30] <sammichToo> is*
[16:11:05] <systemfault> It's about using the right tool for the job..
[16:11:25] <systemfault> You can find a real csv parser for any language...
[16:11:47] <Seb-> shht
[16:11:50] <sammichToo> suppose I had an application, that I wrote in the window namespace (entirely). I can really just put the whole thing in an IIFE and call it a day?
[16:11:52] <Seb-> manual csv parsing sounds hilarious
[16:13:10] <sammichToo> you know, to prevent clashing and overall safer design
[16:13:37] <systemfault> Seb-: s/hilarious/like a waste of time
[16:13:44] <mvpgraff> how about i just realized my ajax post isn't validating my form... The validation goes off, but then it still f'ing posts!!!
[16:13:59] <Seb-> systemfault: depends on the person doing it. not me = hilarious. me = waste of time.
[16:14:07] <systemfault> Ah :D
[16:26:19] <Joe7> Seb-: validation does NOT work on all of them! It only validates the _1_st input. Page submits withn 2nd/3rd/etc being empty just fine
[16:26:25] <Joe7> That's the prob :>
[16:27:00] <Seb-> Joe7: validation does work, it adjusts the label and everything
[16:27:15] <Seb-> but like I said, all your inputs have the same name
[16:28:39] <Joe7> yeah but they have [], that should work, shouldn't it?
[16:29:25] <Seb-> I'm not sure if you can do that with text inputs?
[16:29:58] <Seb-> I doubt it
[16:30:03] <Joe7> works just fine on the backend, as it gets sent through as an array
[16:30:25] <Joe7> as in, all inputs (when filled that is)
[16:30:31] <Seb-> the validation messes up though
[16:31:07] <Joe7> but euhm, do you get me? The form is not suppused to submit if any of the inputs is empty
[16:31:16] <Seb-> validation requires only the first to be filled in correctly
[16:31:17] <Joe7> but it DOES submit with empty 2nd input
[16:31:29] <Joe7> why just the first? I meant to apply it to all
[16:31:57] <Joe7> that's why I have
[16:31:59] <Joe7>  $('#addressDiv').find('.locationDate').each(function () {
[16:31:59] <Joe7>         $(this).rules("add", {
[16:31:59] <Joe7> etc
[16:32:06] <Joe7> which should match all, shouldn't it?
[16:32:16] <Seb-> Joe7: it validates the one you're currently typing in. text displayed in the label = the one you're currently typing in. but when you submit the form, it only needs to validate the first one
[16:32:48] <Seb-> if you give them different names, they all need to be validated when the form submits
[16:33:12] <Seb-> http://jsfiddle.net/xdS8f/2/  (note: don't click "Add Extra Input", I only modified the 2nd input)
[16:38:08] <Joe7> Seb-: ack, didn't even think this can be the problem, but apparently it is, jquery doesn't support arrays out of the box. Thx man.
[16:38:51] <Seb-> Joe7: it might just be the validation plugin :)
[16:39:01] <Joe7> yeah meant that sorry ;>
[16:47:14] <guhcampos> I'm trying to use jquery on a local file, being accessed through file:// - but every time the file loads all $("#id").click() functions are called automatically. Is this expected? Is there a limitation for using query locally?
[16:51:52] <Seb-> guhcampos: there are some limitations, but nothing should be wrong with .click()
[16:53:39] <guhcampos> Weird. Is there something wrong with this code: http://pastie.org/8080607 (I'm kind of a javascript noob, so it might be something stupid)
[16:53:49] <robinwkurtz> Anyone able to help with novice jquery/javascript
[16:53:53] <Joe7> Seb-: so I need http://www.codeboss.in/web-funda/2009/05/27/jquery-validation-for-array-of-input-elements/ . But I hate the hacky way, do you happen to know if its possible to override checkForm() method of validation instead? :o
[16:53:57] <guhcampos> every time the page loads I get two alerts, one for loja01 and the other for loja02
[16:54:38] <Seb-> guhcampos:  $('#id').click(function() { alert('text'); });
[16:55:21] <Seb-> see if you used that right while I help out Joe7 for a sec :)
[16:56:02] <guhcampos> np, Hmm I know I can use the anonymous function stuff but since it's a single function that can be called on click() from an undefined number of buttons, I'd prefer to call it from outside
[16:56:06] <Seb-> Joe7: that's not a hacky way, it counts the elements and loops them. it's more of a fix than a hack.
[16:57:01] <Joe7> yeah but I don't want to alter the file of validation directly..not to mess up the path for future updates. Would like to override/overload this function externally
[16:58:00] <robinwkurtz8> Looking for help with slideToggle
[16:58:11] <guhcampos> i mean, define it only once and just apply it's call on the click events
[16:58:39] <Seb-> guhcampos: don't forget semicolons
[16:59:52] <guhcampos> ouch, Seb- python syndrome
[17:00:40] <Seb-> guhcampos: I doubt that'd fix it though :) I've seen that kind of thing before and it still worked
[17:02:43] <Seb-> guhcampos: anonymous function fixes it
[17:02:50] <guhcampos> Ow come on, why does th anon function works? http://pastie.org/8080623
[17:03:03] <guhcampos> Seb-: yeah just got to the same conclusion. Weird stuff Oo
[17:03:47] <guhcampos> lol
[17:03:55] <guhcampos>      $('#comprar_loja01').click(function () { comprar("01", "02");}); -> this works as expected
[17:04:03] <Seb-> guhcampos: .click(handler(eventObject))
[17:04:26] <Seb-> you don't have eventObject as param, so maybe jQuery ignores your definition and thinks you're using .click() without params
[17:04:28] <Seb-> to initiate a click?
[17:04:46] <Joe7> Seb-: I found a supposed-to-work way to override checkForm() of validation: $.validator.prototype.checkForm = function () {} but doesn't do a thing :P should it? ;>
[17:05:22] <Seb-> Joe7: if you override it, you need to reimplement it
[17:05:36] <Seb-> but yes it can work, just don't forget to load your override after the library loaded ;)
[17:06:48] <Seb-> guhcampos
[17:06:55] <RyanD> Can someone explain to me the difference between $('this').attr('id') and just this.id
[17:06:56] <Seb-> I realized why your function gets called
[17:07:05] <RyanD> I'm inheriting an insanely laggy bit of 1.7 code
[17:07:22] <Seb-> RyanD: you mean $(this) or $('this') ?
[17:07:25] <RyanD> err
[17:07:26] <RyanD> no quotes
[17:07:27] <RyanD> sorry
[17:07:47] <Seb-> both are similar, $(this).attr('id') is the safe jQuery way
[17:07:52] <RyanD> but SUPER laggy
[17:08:00] <RyanD> performance tests indicate ~25-30x slower
[17:08:07] <RyanD> i recognize in one case
[17:08:20] <RyanD> not finding the ID returns undefined (jquery way), and the other will return an empty string
[17:08:34] <RyanD> i'm just curious if there are any other particular gotchas / things to watch out for, or if they're basically a straight replacement
[17:09:12] <RyanD> i figure that just building in a check for value_returned = "" and using this.id would STILL be faster than utilizing the jQuery way
[17:09:12] <Seb-> .attr() is also used to use the same code cross-browser
[17:09:16] <RyanD> but I could be wrong
[17:09:34] <Seb-> so if you're going for faster, not using jQuery might be faster
[17:09:36] <RyanD> Seb-: How are they different across browsers? Basically, I'm trying to go through an endless ~1600 line piece of spaghetti code
[17:09:41] <RyanD> full rewrite isn't an option
[17:09:46] <RyanD> just based on time constraints
[17:09:54] <RyanD> ~1600 line bit, ~2 days. Ugh.
[17:10:24] <RyanD> Lots of dom manipulation, state kept in DOM, I'd have been smart and done it with templates and NOT kept the fucking state in the DOM, but this wasn't me :).
[17:10:35] <Seb-> RyanD: in your example, not much is different. but some browsers don't like this.that.then stuff. e.g. window.myNamedDiv vs window.getElementById('myNamedDiv')
[17:11:03] <RyanD> right
[17:11:16] <Seb-> note to self: call stuff 'foo' and 'bar' instead of 'myNamedDiv' ;-;
[17:11:19] <RyanD> i'm just curious what those are
[17:11:30] <RyanD> basically, i just want to know what i'm getting myself into
[17:11:45] <RyanD> the crux of it is that I need to speed this the hell up in a very short amount of time
[17:11:54] <RyanD> and it seems like the MAJORITY of the slowdown is just in selectors
[17:12:06] <Seb-> RyanD: http://vanilla-js.com/
[17:12:07] <RyanD> and looping through them
[17:12:18] <RyanD> two days.
[17:12:19] <RyanD> two.
[17:12:27] <RyanD> Rewriting this isn't particularly an option at all.
[17:12:37] <Seb-> too bad, check the ops/sec on vanilla js
[17:12:42] <RyanD> Trust me, I'd *much* rather do that, but adapting it to a framework in this amount of time isn't possible.
[17:13:29] <Seb-> jquery $jq('#test-table'); vs vanilla-js document.getElementById('test-table'); = 350 557 ops/sec vs 12 137 211 ops/sec
[17:13:35] <RyanD> i can read mate :)
[17:13:45] <Seb-> some people don't like clicking links ;)à
[17:14:42] <RyanD> tbh
[17:14:47] <Seb-> I understand you can't switch frameworks, you can switch out selectors for stuff that works on all browsers
[17:14:49] <RyanD> this project SHOULDNT have anything to do with the dom nearly
[17:14:51] <RyanD> right
[17:14:56] <RyanD> and that's my plan
[17:15:03] <RyanD> i'm just curious if there's much else i can do
[17:15:04] <Seb-> .getElementById() works just fine without framework
[17:15:15] <RyanD> some of it is a real mess
[17:15:20] <Seb-> in all honesty, I doubt it. I'm assuming the structure isn't optimal either
[17:15:23] <RyanD> using the element whose id starting with xxxxx
[17:15:31] <RyanD> its 1600 lines of straight spaghetti.
[17:15:39] <RyanD> its really a total trainwreck
[17:16:15] <Seb-> I would start with the obvious, then maybe if load time is no issue, implement both jQuery and vanilla-js and start changing the bottlenecks to vanilla-js
[17:16:19] <devnill> I'm working with the npr api to get a list of mp3s but the response returns a m3u playlist file which contains the mp3 string. Is there a method similiar to jsonp which would allow me to request the data?
[17:16:20] <Seb-> but let the rest run on jquery for the time being
[17:17:13] <RyanD> any collision issues between the two?
[17:17:43] <devnill> When I try a jsonp request on the .m3u file I get 'unexpected end of input' because it isn't valid json
[17:17:55] <Seb-> RyanD: not that I know of
[17:18:27] <Seb-> jQuery is $(), vanilla-js is not that.
[17:25:03] <shoky> devnill: the API server has to support jsonp for it to work. or it has to support CORS. or you gotta make a serverside proxy
[17:33:46] <shoky> devnill: but i see that api does support jsonp
[17:36:30] <shoky> devnill: http://jsfiddle.net/6q5gf/
[17:39:26] <horacsio> any jquery programmer here?
[17:40:08] <shoky> `ask
[17:40:08] <b-ot> shoky: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:41:33] <horacsio> I want to hide/show a div but the animation movement should go to the middle of the div, instead hide/show up or down
[17:44:18] <karlmh> horacsio: i've been studying jquery over the last few weeks, so i'm no expert, but maybe i can help
[17:44:34] <karlmh> horacsio: so how can i help?
[17:47:11] <horacsio> karImh: I only have this code: http://pastebin.com/iBJq4mBd
[17:47:22] <horacsio> which makes a div slide up or down
[17:47:59] <horacsio> I need that div to slide top and bottom to a particular position
[17:49:00] <horacsio> lets say the div height is X and it's slided top and bottom to top20% for example
[17:50:57] <horacsio> or till top: 50px;
[17:51:04] <horacsio> karImh: got the idea?
[17:56:16] <horacsio> karImh: need to go
[17:56:23] <horacsio> get back tomorrow
[17:56:24] <horacsio>  ;)
[18:34:46] <raj> I can't loop in tampermonkey
[18:34:49] <raj> oops
[19:23:01] <bytephilia> How can I move a set of elements above their respective parents?
[19:31:31] <k_sze[work]> Ugh. I have this minified jQuery scrollTo plugin, but I don't which implementation it is exactly.
[19:31:49] <k_sze[work]> I don't *know* which implementation it is exactly.
[19:32:02] <k_sze[work]> I know there are a few on the net.
[19:40:10] <d3m0n> k_sze[work]: http://jsbeautifier.org/
[19:40:37] <EwokFartPorn> Unminifies yo code, broseph
[19:40:59] <tw2113> won't re-add comments though
[19:41:18] <d3m0n> bytephilia: parent();
[19:42:00] <mvpgraff> http://pastebin.com/463f0bqH it's posting to the second one, not posting to the first? Anything worng?
[19:55:20] <__machine> i have <div class="images"><div class="image">...</div><div class="image">...</div>...</div> ... when i do $('div.image:last-child', $('div.images')) ... i get the last div inside every div.image AND the div.image:last-child ... wtf? how do i get just the last div.image (so i can clone and duplicate it)?
[19:56:26] <cardguy1000> When using $.ajax what qualifies as success?  the documentation says "A function to be called if the request succeeds." but I'm not quite sure what that means, I have a 200 OK response but it's not calling success
[19:57:23] <d3m0n> _machine: you're second selector is why it selects all .images class.
[19:57:31] <d3m0n> $('div.images')
[19:58:22] <oojacoboo> anyone have a good tooltip plugin they use?
[19:58:31] <bubblehead> tipsy
[19:58:37] <oojacoboo> I was use tipsy, but seem to have issues with 1.9
[19:58:51] <oojacoboo> and was checking out tooltipsy, but I can't see to do proper delegation with it
[19:59:00] <d3m0n> qTip
[19:59:15] <oojacoboo> d3m0n: is it pretty flexible?
[19:59:19] <d3m0n> Or Twitters Bootstrap tooltip, you can just get the minified js from it
[19:59:26] <oojacoboo> no bootstrap here
[19:59:34] <d3m0n> You dont need bootstrap to use it
[19:59:46] <d3m0n> I like to take pieces from bootstrap sometimes, tooltip being one of them
[20:00:01] <bubblehead> didn't they spin off tipsy? I could be wrong.
[20:00:02] <d3m0n> They offer seperated downloads for the scripts
[20:00:17] <oojacoboo> bubblehead: who?
[20:00:18] <d3m0n> Not sure bubblehead
[20:00:34] <bubblehead> bootstrap. I thought they forked tipsy. Not sure though.
[20:01:37] <oojacoboo> d3m0n: this bootstrap tooltip looks like what I want, does this use jquery?
[20:01:42] <oojacoboo> I see $()
[20:01:47] <d3m0n> yep
[20:01:58] <oojacoboo> alrighty
[20:02:24] <oojacoboo> do you know if you can delegate it?
[20:02:41] <oojacoboo> delegate the binding that is, for the event
[20:03:23] <oojacoboo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9958825/how-do-i-bind-twitter-bootstrap-tooltips-to-dynamically-created-elements
[20:03:25] <oojacoboo> :)
[20:03:30] <d3m0n> :)
[20:04:16] <oojacoboo> Inspired by the excellent jQuery.tipsy plugin written by Jason Frame; Tooltips are an updated version, which don't rely on images, use CSS3 for animations, and data-attributes for local title storage.
[20:04:30] <d3m0n> Well well
[20:04:49] <oojacoboo> perfect then, since I've been using tipsy for 4 years
[20:04:51] <d3m0n> bubblehead was right :)
[20:05:07] <bubblehead> yay! A rare occasion.
[20:06:03] <bubblehead> you are having problems with tipsy and 1.9 b/c .live doesn't work since 1.7, right? You need to fix it to use .on
[20:07:13] <oojacoboo> bubblehead: I fixed that
[20:07:31] <oojacoboo> was still having issues with it firing and honestly didn't want to dive into it enough to find out why
[20:07:42] <oojacoboo> I've updated so many libs today, it's just update day
[20:08:06] <bubblehead> ten 4. Those are fun days (insert sarcasm).
[20:39:04] <sammichToo> long shot: I have everything inside an IIFE, and I want to call the occasional function from console to debug it. Obviously they're not in scope and I already return some object to the window scope. But is there a way to return the whole scope/context? So I'd just be able to do       var retVal = (function() { /* bunch of functions*./ }()); retVal.aFunc()?
[20:39:54] <sammichToo> that is, without naming everything in the return of that IIFE
[20:41:19] <AfroTurf> i tried to delegate ("body").on("click", $(this)... and no matter where i clicked it the event triggered.  trying to do the equiv of $(this).live()
[20:41:49] <sammichToo> what is $(this)?
[20:42:36] <AfroTurf> sammichToo: ah sorry bad example
[20:42:51] <AfroTurf> $("a.btn")
[20:43:50] <sammichToo> so that's $('body').on('click', $('a.button'), handler)?
[20:44:26] <sammichToo> or is it $('a.button')
[20:44:32] <sammichToo> .on(...)
[20:46:15] <AfroTurf> it's in a plugin $(this) is whatever.. however my question pertains to the correct way to do .live() approach
[20:47:41] <sammichToo> $(selector).on(event, 'another_selector', function() { /**/ });
[20:48:17] <sammichToo> if you leave out 'another_selector' it's effectively a bind
[20:48:38] <sammichToo> afaiu
[20:48:53] <AfroTurf> sammichToo: so in my example $("a.button").on("click", "body",... to delegate from the body tag inward ?
[20:50:04] <sammichToo> hmm, I think the 'another_selector' is actually run as a '.find()' on $(selector)
[20:51:27] <sammichToo> it binds on $(selector).find('another_selector'), bubbles to $(selector), and calls the handler
[20:52:27] <AfroTurf> sammichToo: hmm for me $("body").on('click', 'a.btn',..) doesn't do that. i'll try a fiddle and see what happens
[20:52:30] <AfroTurf> thanks for your help
[20:53:19] <sammichToo> no worries
[20:55:25] <AfroTurf> sammichToo: ya it works if i supply another_selector in quotes just not $('another_selector')
[20:57:34] <Tark> hello guys! I have a problem. http://pastebin.com/XTGBsqZL -- I need to get src of the image in div, but...
[21:01:50] <Tark|3> god damned 3G
[21:12:42] <Tark|3> why the hell find is not a function?
[21:13:22] <oojacoboo> ?
[21:14:16] <Tark|3> oojacoboo, http://pastebin.com/XTGBsqZL
[21:15:56] <Tark|3> oh, I somehow got the success
[21:16:40] <Tark|3> thanks for your help
[21:17:43] <oojacoboo> lol live is deprecated bro
[21:17:49] <oojacoboo> g/l
[21:26:12] <AfroTurf> http://jsfiddle.net/dKHNv/ what's the correct way to set the selector argument on line 8?
[21:29:57] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: do you need to bind that to the document?
[21:30:12] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: either that or "body"
[21:31:29] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: i want to bind my event in a plugin though.. so $("a").awesomePlugin()
[21:32:18] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: I'm honestly not sure… I would have thought that'd work with the object, but obv it expects the selector
[21:32:56] <oojacoboo> you could just get the selector from the object I guess and pass it in
[21:32:56] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: right.. $(document).on("click"), "a").. works np
[21:33:22] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: ah yes where do i read about doin that
[21:33:23] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: right
[21:33:34] <AfroTurf> that's what i was thinking
[21:33:59] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: .selector?
[21:34:39] <AfroTurf> lol removed in 1.9
[21:34:49] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/dKHNv/1/
[21:34:54] <oojacoboo> seems to be working in 1.9.1 there
[21:35:22] <oojacoboo> but yea
[21:36:01] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: i'm just going to end up refactoring everything.. damn
[21:36:25] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: http://jsfiddle.net/dKHNv/2/
[21:36:27] <oojacoboo> there :)
[21:37:05] <Validatorian> I'm having a scope issue -- I have a to 'return true'; in a function, but in order to detect whether I should return true, I need an anonymous jquery function around it, so when I 'return true' it's outside of the scope -- any ideas? https://gist.github.com/Valid/4398cb2e27a27f9483e2
[21:37:08] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: still gives the unexpected result
[21:37:10] <garthk> Using jquery-mobile 3: if I manage to keep my app to a single page, could I use the #-based navigation and "pushState" to match my document structure?
[21:37:17] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: unexpected how?
[21:37:23] <oojacoboo> it's triggering the click event for me
[21:37:28] <oojacoboo> logging
[21:37:50] <AfroTurf> click anywhere in the result box
[21:38:15] <oojacoboo> oh
[21:38:31] <garthk> Validatorian, could you close around $scope again?
[21:38:45] <garthk> Oh, hang on.
[21:38:55] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: i'm going to update this in a plugin example
[21:38:55] <garthk> Validatorian: where do you need that 'true' to go?
[21:39:40] <Validatorian> garthk: the working code would be: 'exitMenu: function () { return true }'
[21:40:08] <Validatorian> I am going to make a non-anonymous function, that should work...
[21:40:49] <Validatorian> hrm, no
[21:41:07] <garthk> Validatorian: didn't think so. Ok, so return true is for the click handler… is the problem that $scope is undefined?
[21:41:41] <garthk> I'd be surprised, there, but I only tend to close around one level of stack. :)
[21:41:46] <Validatorian> garthk: No, the 'return true' just isn't hitting the exitMenu function, it's constrained to the jquery event handler (I believe)
[21:42:23] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/dKHNv/3/
[21:43:06] <garthk> Validatorian: well, of course. You attached a handler to $(document)'s click event. You're trying to return from inside that handler. If you want to return to exitMenu's caller, move the 'return true' outside the $(document).one(…) argument.
[21:43:08] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: almost works.. it's triggering both now for only clicking one. but you at least have to click one
[21:43:16] <oojacoboo> yea
[21:43:45] <Validatorian> garthk: Well yea, but the 'return true' needs to only happen after the click, so how would I do that outside of the .one()?
[21:44:16] <garthk> Validatorian: you can't. You're calling document.one, then returning. You've already returned. You don't get to return again.
[21:44:55] <Validatorian> the return should only happen after the click, not on creation of the event handler, as I understand it?
[21:45:45] <garthk> The 'return true' in function (e) { … } returns to $document's click handler.
[21:46:07] <Validatorian> right -- that's the problem. I'm trying to find the solution :)
[21:46:27] <Validatorian> I need it to return to the exitMenu function
[21:46:27] <garthk> Validatorian: the statement beginning in line 9 ends in line 14. Then you fall off the end of exitMenu, thus returning.
[21:46:44] <garthk> Validatorian: well, that's impossible. Find another mechanism for doing what you want.
[21:46:57] <Validatorian> any suggestions for an alternate mechanism?
[21:47:35] <garthk> Validatorian: no, because I know not the faintest bloody thing about $scope.categoryMenu.menuAim. I bet if you look for gists containing some or more of those terms, though, you might find a hint.
[21:47:59] <Validatorian> naw, that's just angular nonsense, they are just jquery objects, should have cleaned that up
[21:48:14] <Validatorian> $scope.categoryMenu is basically $('#menu')
[21:48:53] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/dKHNv/4/ this is the only way i can get it to work property
[21:49:08] <AfroTurf> s/property/properly
[21:49:30] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: I think you need to use the method params of the each loop
[21:49:53] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: good idea
[21:53:29] <Validatorian> garthk: FWIW, this is what I'm trying to do: https://github.com/kamens/jQuery-menu-aim/issues/9 -- I need this to return true when there's a click outside of the menu, the way it's implemented, I can close it by returning 'true', so I need to do that when there's a click, just not sure how to code that.
[21:53:41] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: no luck
[21:53:46] <oojacoboo> :/
[21:54:02] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: assign an data-id?
[21:54:51] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: ya that's one way but http://jsfiddle.net/dKHNv/4/ way would require less refactoring
[21:55:09] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: sure, but that sucks :P
[21:55:17] <AfroTurf> ya
[21:55:27] <AfroTurf> i can't be the only person who's had this issue
[21:55:35] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: you should be able to get the array of objects from the jquery object though
[21:55:43] <oojacoboo> so no need to repass the a
[21:56:04] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: start logging some things and look at the objects
[21:56:09] <oojacoboo> see what you can take out and make work
[21:57:04] <Validatorian> figured it out -- well, an alternate way that works just as well, anyhow
[21:57:10] <Validatorian> thanks for your help, garthk
[21:57:24] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: it makes sense to pass the selector though..
[21:57:53] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: I guess
[21:59:51] <garthk> Validatorian: no worries.
[22:04:31] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: well idk.. maybe someone else here knows
[22:04:55] <oojacoboo> AfroTurf: I'd give it a deeper look if I wasn't so deep in stuff of my own right now
[22:05:10] <oojacoboo> but you should be able to specify each direct object within the collection
[22:05:27] <AfroTurf> oojacoboo: ya no worries man i appreciate the help
[22:07:46] <AfroTurf> anyone know how to properly delegate a selector with .on  http://jsfiddle.net/dKHNv/3/

[22:24:24] <Nancy2012> I have a question.. I am using html5 drag n drop on my fancybox popup window.. but it doesnt seem work on overlay window ?? But when i dont use overlay window(popup), it works(when i load that specific div on the parent window)

[22:29:24] <oojacoboo> I'm going with a bug, but maybe I'm missing something here
[22:31:04] <Jellyg00se> Nancy2012: you need to look more into jquery and how the doms interact wiith each other would be my "guess"
[22:31:35] <Jellyg00se> apart from that, grab your bollocks mate, do somerthing radical and do something for the best :)
[22:41:33] <Nancy2012> Is it possible to enabled just one main div on the overlay window.. ??
[22:41:52] <Nancy2012> disabled all parent divs too..
[22:42:24] <Nancy2012> my problem is …. my html5 based file upload alóng with drag n drop feature wouldnt work on overlay..
[22:42:40] <Nancy2012> so i decided to do something.. which just focus on overlay window..
[22:43:00] <Nancy2012> and disabled all divs for onfocus..
