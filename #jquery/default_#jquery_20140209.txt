[00:48:21] <scathen^C> hey all. I am building an extension that alters youtube pages (which works fine). The problem Im having is that when you click on a new video in youtube it acts like a single page app, and loads the new video without reloading the page. Any ideas how I can detect that event so I can rerun my code?
[01:03:11] <xqo> is it possible to load other pages without displaying them? So that you can load a page before a user tries to open it?
[01:23:33] <tlm> hi all
[01:23:57] <tlm> wondering if function parameters are optional by default ?
[01:24:46] <tlm> in most other languages, function params are made optional by going func( param="" ) or func( param=0 )
[01:24:58] <tlm> obv, this does not work in jQ
[01:25:17] <systemfault> Yes they are... but unfortunately, JS doesn't support default values
[01:25:21] <warrend> hi
[01:26:06] <tlm> thanks systemfault, so `Yes they are...` optional by default ??
[01:26:20] <tlm> I did not notice any errors in console
[01:26:28] <tlm> when I omitted a param
[01:26:44] <vinky> tlm, each option gets undefined if you dont add them AFAIR
[01:26:45] <systemfault> tlm: They're undefined.
[01:26:48] <warrend> i use window.location.hash to go to an anchor, however if the content wasn't yet rendered, the position on the page becomes incorrect
[01:26:51] <warrend> how can i fix that?
[01:26:59] <vinky> s/add/pass/
[01:27:01] <tlm> ahh thanks that clears it up
[01:27:04] <tlm> ty guys
[01:27:09] <TheJHNZ> if(requiredfield.hasClass('validation-required') && requiredfield.val() == '') {
[01:27:15] <TheJHNZ> for some reason this isnt working
[01:27:28] <tlm> ( although, I should have just debegged it ) ;)
[01:27:33] <ph88> what reason might that be TheJHNZ  ?
[01:27:41] <TheJHNZ> ahh
[01:27:42] <TheJHNZ> :-)
[01:27:45] <tlm> o/
[01:27:53] <TheJHNZ> i have no idea
[01:27:54] <TheJHNZ> :<
[01:28:17] <ph88> :<
[01:28:22] <ph88> try debugging it
[01:28:51] <TheJHNZ> var requiredfield = $(this).closest('form').find('textarea, input');
[01:29:06] <TheJHNZ> i want to select the textarea or input with the class 'validation-required'
[01:29:19] <TheJHNZ> how would i add that to this selector ?
[01:30:25] <systemfault> .find('textarea.validation-required, input.validation-required');
[01:30:38] <TheJHNZ> ty <3
[02:14:16] <SteveBenner09> has anyone developed with IgniteUI
[03:03:58] <Choicefresh> Hi. I'm sort of new to jQuery. I have a button that I'm trying to change the click handler for so it will pass a pointer to a Parse object, but for some reason $('body').on('click', '.addFriend', addFriendTrigger(hangUsers[curUser])); results in addFriendTrigger being called for a different button
[03:04:54] <Choicefresh> i was doing $('.addFriend').on('click', addFriendTrigger ...) before
[03:06:13] <systemfault> Choicefresh: What you're doing doesn't make sense.
[03:06:42] <systemfault> $('body').on('click', '.addFriend', addFriendTrigger(hangUsers[curUser]));  Would call addFriendTrigger(hangUsers[curUser]) then assign its return value as the handler
[03:07:01] <systemfault> So.. if it returns nothing.. it would be the same as doing: $('body').on('click', '.addFriend', undefined);
[03:07:05] <Choicefresh> systemfault: well i'm creating buttons in an array and want each one to be associated with an object
[03:07:56] <systemfault> Okay? Do you have a code we could take a look at
[03:12:48] <Choicefresh> systemfault: It's sort of a mess... I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm not sure you want to see it lol
[03:17:34] <systemfault> Choicefresh: The only thing you need to know is that the third parameter is a function
[03:17:51] <systemfault> So.. the name of a function without calling it.
[03:18:51] <Choicefresh> if hangUsers[curUser] is a pointer, how can i store a reference to it and attach it to the button so that it can be accessed from the action handler later?
[03:21:58] <systemfault> Is curUser a index?
[03:21:59] <Choicefresh> kinda in the process of making the code readable. it's from a hackathon
[03:25:46] <Choicefresh> curUser is an index, yeah. sorry, missed that message
[03:26:01] <Choicefresh> i'm iterating through hangUsers in a for loop
[03:27:25] <systemfault> Then you could store the object or even the index on the node at the beginning and then set your handler
[03:28:11] <systemfault> Are you creating a button per user?
[03:30:18] <Choicefresh> yeah. oh the index is a good idea; that might work
[03:31:24] <systemfault> That makes your handler a lot simpler
[06:14:33] <nhqe> hey guys, any idea why I'm getting this jerky motion on my slideDown animations? http://bymasque.com/ (services section)
[06:20:21] <neredsenvy> Um I tried finding this via google but not much luck. Is there a jquery plugin for a panel that would slide from bottom up and would be fixed at the bottom of the page.
[06:20:56] <neredsenvy> Like a button would be fixed to the bottom of the page and once you click it a panel would slide up from the bottom towards top
[06:32:58] <bumbar> $('input[type="text"]').blur(function() {...});  this should bind to every input with text type on the page, right?
[07:02:38] <Adlai> how can I get jQuery to return the current listeners on an event?
[07:05:34] <ravenzz> $._data(elem, "events")
[07:08:13] <Adlai> ravenzz: I got that much from google, but what do I do with the returned value?
[07:08:52] <ravenzz> Adlai console.dir($._data(element, "events"))
[07:11:03] <Adlai> ravenzz: I get closure objects with lots of self-references and no source locations :-\
[07:11:28] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[07:11:56] <Adlai> poke my way through webapps
[07:12:03] <Adlai> figure out how the web works
[07:25:12] <Adlai> ravenzz: OK, got it. Some weirdness in console.dir's presentation algorithm, but I found a way around it.
[07:25:15] <Adlai> thanks :)
[07:57:11] <casaper> Hello. To get myself to know a bit of jQuery and JS, i made this http://j.mp/1d8Nx4W experiment with the usage of REST, Jquery. It is the $.ajax and my function getValuesOfCurrency I'm talking about. I get i'ts return, and the object contains something like values.responseJSON, that is visible in console.log(values). But trying to access console.log(values.responseJSON) it is undefined. Why?
[08:04:37] <danheberden> casaper: because when you're looking at that object in console, it has already resolved
[08:04:39] <shoky> casaper: ajax is asynchronous, the callback is called much later than when "return targetCurrency;"  is executed.. you want:  function getValuesOfCurrency(..) { return $.ajax(...); }        then to use it:   getValuesOfCurrency().done(function(values) { console.log... });
[08:04:40] <danheberden> thus your data is there
[08:04:51] <shoky> oi
[08:04:54] <danheberden> heh
[08:05:13] <danheberden> or in your code, casaper, you do values = getValuesByCurrency() and that does the ajax stuff
[08:06:03] <danheberden> in that function, you could return the ajax request: return $.ajax(...); and in your code where you use values, use the approach shoky said
[08:06:47] <danheberden> also, learn about deferreds and promises and you'll understand more, have more fullfillling relatonships, and get richer
[08:06:56] <danheberden> two of those aren't guaranteed, though
[08:07:27] <casaper> danheberden: first of all, thx for taking a look. ok, I'm a bit too slow to get this all sorted. I'll look into it straight away
[08:07:32] <casaper> danheberden:
[08:07:37] <shoky> ?ajax101
[08:07:38] <b-ot> shoky: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpg and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[08:07:55] <casaper> danheberden: so in JS i cannot pass on this objects from one function to another?
[08:08:12] <danheberden> casaper: you can, but remember it's asynchronous
[08:08:19] <danheberden> this jqXHR object you get back from ajax
[08:08:24] <danheberden> so wherever you want to use it
[08:08:35] <danheberden> you'll be passing a function to run when it's ready
[08:08:39] <Velveeta> you can pass that promise object around to different functions and let them all attach callbacks to it
[08:09:01] <danheberden> casaper: i use your situation as an example of why people have troubles and should use promises here: vimeo.com/22687950
[08:10:39] <casaper> danheberden: ok, looking at it. I seem still to misunderstand this asynchronic nature. the Obj is there and next line it isn't, without even hopping to another scope. But obviously I'll have to dig myself quite abit deeper to understand then ;-) Thank you
[08:11:24] <shoky> casaper: if you want to execute something AFTER the ajax is complete (only then you have the values it returned), you must do that in a callback e.g. a .done(..) callback
[08:11:41] <Velveeta> well, it *does* hop to another scope, an asynchronous request is issued by the browser, and it periodically checks up on it to see if it's completed, and if it's not, it continues processing your other code
[08:11:57] <shoky> if you do something outside of a callback (like your console.log(values))  it will run BEFORE the ajax response has arrived
[08:12:11] <Velveeta> when it detects that the request has completed, it then notifies the listeners that are waiting for that data that "hey, data is ready for you now, here it is" and executes your callbacks
[08:12:32] <casaper> Velveeta shoky: I see. I just need to get beter understanding of the scope then
[08:12:54] <shoky> the issue is less one of scope, more one of time
[08:13:11] <Velveeta> right, think of it as multithreaded within a single thread, it's more task-switching
[08:13:15] <casaper> I'm plugin the vimeo video post given by danheberden into my brainfogetters ;)
[08:13:44] <Velveeta> lots of things that rely on time to complete will hand execution power back to the js engine and say go ahead and keep executing your stuff, i'll let you know when i'm ready for further processing
[08:13:50] <danheberden> casaper if you aren't familiar with the concept of functions as objects, i'd research that as well
[08:14:26] <casaper> danheberden: actually I am, but as it seems not really in JS.
[08:15:42] <casaper> danheberden: I'd consider a function as a object as a method
[08:16:03] <danheberden> ?jqf
[08:16:04] <Velveeta> did you mean 'an object with a method'?
[08:16:10] <danheberden> hmph
[08:16:21] <casaper> yeah
[08:16:31] <shoky> ?ftjq
[08:16:31] <b-ot> shoky: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[08:16:32] <shoky> ?
[08:16:45] <casaper> so obj.functionobj would be obj' s method
[08:17:08] <danheberden> there we go
[08:17:10] <danheberden> ?jqf
[08:17:10] <b-ot> danheberden: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[08:17:22] <shoky> oo
[08:17:22] <Velveeta> so that's not entirely accurate, think of it more as a first-class object that's directly executable, kind of like you can do var foo = 5 or var foo = new Number(5); one is a primitive, the other is an actual object
[08:17:56] <Velveeta> a function is something that can be directly invoked, but it's *also* a fist-class object that you can append properties to
[08:18:15] <Velveeta> you can totally do something like this: function foo () {}   foo.bar = true;
[08:18:29] <casaper> so say functionobj.mytitle = "abc"
[08:18:38] <danheberden> and then function omg(datFunction){ datFunction(); };  omg(foo);
[08:18:46] <danheberden> (as an example of first-class)
[08:19:07] <Velveeta> in fact, the jquery ui widget factory does something similar with its $.widget factory function, there are $.widget.extend and $.widget.bridge properties on it that are additional functions using $.widget as a namespace for themselves
[08:19:37] <shoky> heh don't need to go that far.  $ is a good example
[08:20:27] <shoky> $('#mydiv')  a function,  with properties:  $.ajax
[08:20:36] <danheberden> casaper the reason i mention passing functions around is that's what you do when you create an anonymous function
[08:20:55] <danheberden> something like var handle = function(e){ console.log('clicked!'); } $(document).on('click', handle);
[08:20:58] <Velveeta> shoky: good point :)
[08:21:12] <danheberden> where you just pass functions around to be called at a later date
[08:21:26] <danheberden> thus, when you say "hey, server, go get something" you need a way to say "also, do this when you're done"
[08:21:35] <danheberden> and you have to do that by passing in something that can be _ran_
[08:21:45] <danheberden> which is ... wait for it... a function \o/
[08:21:56] <danheberden> until we get yields anyway
[08:21:57] <casaper> danheberden: so thats where my timing and existance trouble (or better misunderstanding) all comes from. Because ajax is actually function $(ajax){function ajax(){}} sort of
[08:22:13] <Velveeta> are yields coming w/ es6? i can't remember
[08:22:21] <danheberden> kind of - it uses deferreds to have a nice api around this problem
[08:22:37] <danheberden> so that the object you get back has some nice methods defined to accept and use those callbacks
[08:22:54] <danheberden> so when you say var jqXHR = $.ajax(params)
[08:23:15] <danheberden> you have this object with a tidy api. jqXHR.then(callback)
[08:23:22] <danheberden> where callback is ran when the thing finally resolves
[08:23:24] <davison> New to jQuery.  Wondering how to toggle visibility of multiple divs using same class name.  I.e. Hide all divs, show only specific div of the header that was clicked (so that i don't need seperate class or ID for each div or click(function(){$(class).toggle()} )
[08:23:44] <danheberden> that video i linked to you demonstrates that
[08:24:15] <danheberden> davison just select what you want via the selector
[08:24:31] <danheberden> $('.allthosethings').hide() or whatever
[08:24:49] <danheberden> or $('.allthosethings').toggleClass('youknowwhattodocss')
[08:25:10] <casaper> Thx 2 all: danheberden, Velveeta, shoky
[08:25:14] <Velveeta> davison: you can just set your css up to something like this: .container div.someClass { display: none; } .container.show div.someClass { display: block; }
[08:25:19] <Velveeta> casaper: no problem
[08:25:39] <Velveeta> davison: and then just add a class to your parent div, which will toggle the visible state of the child divs
[08:25:55] <davison> I understand that, but i dont want to toggle visibility of ALL children
[08:26:15] <Velveeta> well that's why you need to give a special class name to the ones you do want to toggle
[08:26:16] <davison> wondering if i can detect specific child that was clicked (in my case, UL, but any selector really)
[08:26:19] <Velveeta> hence the div.someClass
[08:26:26] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha
[08:26:35] <davison> wondered if i could do it without specific class name, as currently im doing it via ul1, ul2 etc
[08:26:46] <davison> (not the actual names...but you get the idea)
[08:27:01] <Velveeta> well if you only want to toggle visibility of the click target itself, you can do something like this: $('.container').on('click', '.someClass', function () { $(this).show(); })
[08:27:24] <Velveeta> that'll bind 1 event listener to the top-level container, and fire for any child with class "someClass"
[08:27:35] <Velveeta> although that should probably say $(this).children().show()
[08:27:48] <Velveeta> because if it's already invisible to be shown itself, then you can't really click on it :D
[08:32:32] <davison> ah, think i found a solution.  I basically have <h>List title><ul>.....</ul>.  $('.titleClass').click(function(){ $(this).next('ul').toggle();});  Does exactly what i'm looking for, only hiding the ul directly following the header.
[08:33:21] <Velveeta> awesome
[08:35:09] <davison> I should probably actually continue my reading.  Coming from knowledge (and teaching) of various other languages, tend to just dive in feet first, but none of experience is in web, so js and jQuery is a bit of a step.
[08:36:31] <Velveeta> make sure you don't skip over the foundational js ;)
[08:36:49] <Velveeta> it's so easy to jump right in with a framework these days, that most people don't bother to learn the guts of the language, or why frameworks are able to do what they do
[08:38:41] <davison> Yeah.  I do like to pick up the material when doing something substantial, so actually purchased several books.  JS - Definitive, JS & jQuery - Missing Manual and JS Allonge.  Any experience or opinions on these books ?
[08:40:12] <Velveeta> i have the definitive guide, but haven't read it, and haven't heard of the other 2, so can't really comment on any of them :)
[08:57:09] <LoneStar99> howdy folks.
[08:59:36] <LoneStar99> what is the deal with values from an input box and on click sending to an ajax function,  keep getting an error unless I hardcode a value in the <input type=text" id="foo" value="123">  -> $('#foo').val(); -> works
[09:00:30] <Velveeta> can you make a jsfiddle demo out of what you're trying to do that isn't working for you?
[09:00:31] <LoneStar99> <input type="text" id="foo"> -> $('#foo').val(); -> causes jquery error....
[09:00:58] <LoneStar99> Velveeta: ok let me get something simple togethere
[09:04:02] <Velveeta> i just whipped one up actually, but i got an empty string as i would expect
[09:04:04] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/L6G5W/
[09:04:57] <Velveeta> are you wrapping your code in a document.ready?
[09:09:54] <LoneStar99> yeap
[09:10:22] <LoneStar99> Velveeta: trying to simulate my code... almost ready
[09:10:28] <Velveeta> ok
[09:16:07] <LoneStar99> Velveeta: --> http://jsfiddle.net/85c2e/  do not seem to get an error =(
[09:18:19] <Velveeta> yeah, the value property exists on the dom node even if you don't define an attribute for it, so jquery should just return whatever the value of that property is, which would be an empty string… i'm not sure why you're getting undefined unless it's not finding your element for some reason.. if you console.log($('#foo')) do you get a valid return?
[09:19:54] <LoneStar99> Velveeta: just changed some code, will test brb in about 10mins
[09:20:00] <Velveeta> ok
[09:24:52] <LoneStar99> Velveeta:  what about getting the text input box which has not yet been set as value??  does that make sense?
[09:25:11] <Velveeta> not exactly
[09:25:22] <Velveeta> getting its value before the value has been set?
[09:26:19] <LoneStar99> Velveeta: ok brb let me test something else
[09:26:25] <Velveeta> ok
[09:28:48] <LoneStar99> Velveeta: for your help will send you an invite for free php/mysql dev hosting
[09:29:23] <Velveeta> thanks, but i already have a host i'm perfectly happy with :)
[09:29:44] <Velveeta> besides, i don't accept any payment for help in here, that's what i'm here for :)
[09:30:39] <LoneStar99> well not payment, just free and in beer =) lol
[09:30:54] <LoneStar99> ok brb need to debug before you take off
[09:31:02] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[11:00:01] <wondernment> jquery adds a pointer style to my imgs and removes the margin style
[11:00:14] <wondernment> could someone help?
[11:00:29] <Velveeta> jquery doesn't come with css itself… are you talking about jquery ui or mobile or something?
[11:00:49] <wondernment> im talking about adding images with .css
[11:01:14] <wondernment> I've tryed both to add the css seperately and inline
[11:01:41] <Velveeta> are you talking about setting a background-image?
[11:01:42] <wondernment> can i paste it for you
[11:01:55] <wondernment> adding images to a div
[11:01:55] <Velveeta> yes, go paste it into something like jsfiddle or jsbin
[11:01:58] <wondernment> thanks
[11:07:00] <wondernment> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/sx643/
[11:07:22] <wondernment> my problem is the space on the right after you search
[11:08:12] <decx> good lord, how do you do not get lost in all these repetitions
[11:09:05] <wondernment> i would use server-side, but I don't have the time
[11:09:12] <wondernment> i kinda want it to be client side
[11:09:33] <Velveeta> so, i don't see jquery doing anything to any margin in these img's
[11:09:55] <systemfault> decx: What repetition?
[11:09:56] <Velveeta> and i'm not quite sure what you mean by "my problem is the space on the right after you search"
[11:10:29] <decx> systemfault are we looking at the same fiddle?
[11:10:51] <wondernment> after you type something into champstext, if you look in firefox web dev the inline margins are deleted
[11:11:06] <wondernment> i just want to keep the margins, so the document looks uniform
[11:11:36] <Velveeta> in chrome it's working fine, but i'll take a look at it in FF
[11:11:44] <wondernment> alright thanks
[11:12:06] <Velveeta> but i should add that you already have css properties in place for #champsdiv img { margin: 1.5px; } so there's no reason to have inline styles applying those same properties
[11:12:25] <wondernment> alright, cool
[11:12:54] <wondernment> i just added them because after you run the jquery, margins get deleted
[11:13:05] <wondernment> could it be my pc? :o
[11:13:20] <Velveeta> it shouldn't matter what the pic is, because the margin is external to the node itself
[11:14:09] <wondernment> i thought that
[11:14:27] <wondernment> are you seeing that there aren't any margins after you type something in
[11:17:21] <Velveeta> in FF, i'm seeing all of the matching images appear for an instant and then completely disappear
[11:17:35] <wondernment> woh
[11:17:35] <Velveeta> this code is full of problems, i'm retooling it for you :)
[11:17:40] <wondernment> alright thanks!
[11:22:10] <decx> looking forward to your approach Velveeta here's mine http://jsfiddle.net/tLsQr/
[11:22:50] <Velveeta> i'm getting close to finished, had to copy/paste it into sublime so i could do a lot of multi-line editing to trim the fat :)
[11:23:02] <wondernment> thanks
[11:23:05] <decx> yeah i didnt bother with that at all ha

[11:35:15] <Velveeta> lonestar99: you can have the variable declared externally to the keyup function, but you need to update it in your keyup function, or else it's only going to find the value it was at document.ready
[11:35:55] <Velveeta> wondernment: no problem, since all of your images were following the same format, you can just store them as data in an array and match against them in keyup, then draw your image tags from the matching data pieces and inject them all at once
[11:36:17] <Velveeta> lonestar99: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/85c2e/3/
[11:38:38] <LoneStar99> Velveeta: ok, the issue is I have about 4+ ajax call that relie on the var, do not want to be redundant in coding, but that is the only way?
[11:40:04] <Velveeta> there's nothing redundant about that… if the ajax vars depend on the current state of that input, you have 2 options, 1) either grab the state fresh for each ajax call, or 2) on keyup, update a more global version of that variable (like what you're doing in the current fiddle) and use that variable in each of the ajax functions
[11:41:34] <LoneStar99> Velveeta: ok makes sense, let me tweak my code ...
[11:41:40] <LoneStar99> thanks, brb
[11:44:31] <LoneStar99> that is working, just need to tweak alot more =(
[11:45:16] <Velveeta> :)
[11:51:45] <decx> nicely done on the search Velveeta
[11:51:55] * Velveeta tips his hat.
[11:52:17] <decx> why not return image.toLowerCase().indexOf(value) != -1; for inline search?
[11:53:42] <decx> i havent thought it through but maybe there's a reason to not do it ;)
[11:54:47] <lonesoldier728> hey was just wondering how to remove an item from a map function on an array i.e x is each map item, so if(x === 0) { remove item code}
[11:55:21] <Velveeta> decx: because i wanted it to search from the beginning of the string, as opposed to a total partial string match
[11:55:54] <Velveeta> lonesoldier728: if you return null from a map callback, it'll skip that item in the final output
[11:56:02] <Velveeta> so if (x === 0) { return null; }
[11:56:21] <lonesoldier728> yeah ok
[11:56:28] <lonesoldier728> but then it leaves a hole
[11:56:31] <lonesoldier728> i have an idea let me see
[11:57:06] <Velveeta> it shouldn't leave a hole.. it should not add anything to the array that's output
[11:57:25] <Velveeta> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[11:57:34] <Velveeta> null or undefined, to remove the item
[12:00:27] <lonesoldier728> hm ok
[12:00:31] <lonesoldier728> let me try
[12:19:23] <__joshua__> lonesoldier728: [].filter
[12:35:11] <MariusIT> hey guys, i'm using the fallowing script to fetch data via jSON http://jsfiddle.net/LjREb/ but it has a problem, it dosen't know the initial height of the data that will be placed there, and on the first click .features-content works jerky. Example here: http://www.extremetop.com/
[12:35:16] <MariusIT> how can i trick it?
[12:39:14] <__joshua__> mariusit: what are we clicking for an example?
[12:39:26] <MariusIT> the red FEATURES button
[12:41:00] <__joshua__> you don't like the way that the initial data there is replaced?
[12:41:39] <MariusIT> yes, it's not smooth
[12:42:15] <msafi> So, I did element.append($('<a>stuff</a>')) then console.log(element), but I can't see <a>stuff</a> any where in the log?
[12:42:54] <__joshua__> thats right.  get rid of dummy data?
[12:43:05] <msafi> Any ideas where to find <a>stuff</a>?
[12:47:28] <gordian> anyone have a good rec for an all around HTML5 audio player?
[12:50:38] <msafi> Very strange. What possibly can make my appended() element not to appear?
[12:51:25] <__joshua__> not appear in the dom? or not appear to run?
[12:52:26] <msafi> __joshua__: It just doesn't get appended in the HTML structure. After I do elementFoo.append(elementBar), I can't find elementBar any where in the console.log(elementFoo)
[12:53:46] <__joshua__> and that line is definately running?
[12:54:23] <__joshua__> do elementFoo.append(elementBar); debugger;  then check
[12:57:21] <gordian> msafi: do you have a jsfiddle?
[12:58:19] <msafi> gordian: not yet. There are a lot of dependencies, making a fiddle wouldn't be easy.
[12:58:26] <msafi> Will make one later if I couldn't solve it.
[12:58:38] <gordian> then try removing some of your dependencies and see if it works
[12:58:46] <msafi> ok
[12:58:50] <gordian> if it does then it's a dependency issue
[12:59:13] <msafi> Though I find it interesting that the very next line after element.append, I do a console.log and I can't find the new element
[12:59:29] <msafi> What could be interfering with it between these two lines?
[13:00:35] <gordian> how is anyone supposed to have any idea if we can't see your code and you yourself said "there are a lot of dependencies"
[13:00:39] <msafi> What's also interesting, is that hovering over element.append when using "debugger" shows different result from what console.log showed
[13:06:59] <__joshua__> console.log shows the CURRENT state, not what was there when console.log was executed
[13:07:27] <msafi> __joshua__: that's news to me!
[13:08:29] <msafi> __joshua__: so var foo = 1; console.log(foo); foo = 2, would print 2?
[13:08:58] <__joshua__> probably not, as foo is not an object
[13:09:33] <msafi> __joshua__: so var foo = { foo: 1 }; console.log(foo.foo); foo = { foo: 2}, would print 2?
[13:10:11] <__joshua__> doesn't for me
[13:10:19] <msafi> Or even if we don't print the object property, but the object itself, i.e. console.log(foo)
[13:10:20] <__joshua__> but if you want to safely log stuff, you need to clone it
[13:19:58] <Tomashe> hey guys in js , if i got few funtions in a row like DoThat1(); DoThat2(); the second function could be runing before the first one ended to do its calculations inside?
[13:20:19] <Tomashe> and if yes , how can i make a function delayed untill the first one is over
[13:21:50] <Velveeta> tomashe: you should look into promises
[13:22:27] <Tomashe> can u show me an example of how to do it with 2 functins
[13:22:35] <Tomashe> cuz i know promises but im not sure about 2 functions
[13:22:50] <Tomashe> like DoThat1().promise().DoThat2(); ?
[13:22:59] <rmurphey> DoThat1 would need to return a promise
[13:23:06] <rmurphey> which DoThat2 would react to
[13:23:08] <Tomashe> hmm
[13:23:18] <Tomashe> an example please
[13:23:33] <Tomashe> DoThat1().promise().DoThat2();  < this wont work?
[13:23:57] <rmurphey> not if DoThat1 doesn't return an object with a promise method
[13:24:11] <Tomashe> hmm
[13:26:29] <Tomashe> i still dont get it and i was reading the jquery promise doc
[13:27:08] <rmurphey> http://jsbin.com/bineb/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:27:53] <__joshua__> actually, DoThat1 would have to return a deferred
[13:27:54] <Tomashe> i see
[13:29:41] <Tomashe> hmm
[13:30:30] <Tomashe> so there is not way to do that with regular function hmm
[13:30:30] <Tomashe> damn
[13:30:58] <rmurphey> how do you mean? without modifying the function?
[13:31:17] <Tomashe> yes i want to make a normal function with normal return object
[13:31:22] <Tomashe> without promise inside
[13:31:30] <rmurphey> if you do doThat1(); doThat2(); then doThat2 will always run second
[13:31:40] <rmurphey> the only problem occurs if doThat1 is doing something async
[13:31:41] <rmurphey> is it?
[13:31:52] <Tomashe> yes but if doThat1() got ajax request
[13:31:53] <Tomashe> yes
[13:31:55] <Tomashe> exactly
[13:32:02] <rmurphey> so just return the ajax request from doThat1
[13:32:11] <Tomashe> im returning
[13:32:12] <rmurphey> the ajax request acts as a promise
[13:32:17] <Tomashe> ohh
[13:32:18] <Tomashe> great
[13:32:34] <Tomashe> so DoThat1().done(DoThat2);
[13:32:53] <rmurphey> assuming you are using $.ajax or similar, yes
[13:32:57] <Tomashe> yes
[13:33:03] <rmurphey> just do var dfd = $.ajax(...); return dfd;
[13:33:08] <Tomashe> there is a way to use the returned object from DoThat1 into the second function?
[13:33:45] <rmurphey> the second function will get as arguments the same args that were passed to the success fn i think
[13:33:54] <rmurphey> use your console to find out :)
[13:33:54] <Tomashe> hmm
[13:34:06] <rmurphey> you may also want to look into .pipe()
[13:34:22] <rmurphey> or maybe it's just called .then() now, i think .pipe() got deprectaed
[13:35:15] <Tomashe> now im all confused hehe
[13:35:21] <rmurphey> read up on promises
[13:35:25] <Tomashe> if my first function got return data;
[13:35:32] <Tomashe> how do i use that return on the second function?
[13:35:49] <rmurphey> just give a try what i said above
[13:35:56] <Tomashe> ok
[13:35:56] <rmurphey> doThat1().done(doThat2);
[13:36:02] <Tomashe> lets try
[13:36:05] <rmurphey> with doThat1 returning the $.ajax request
[13:36:20] <rmurphey> and use your console to see what gets passed to doThat2
[13:38:26] <Tomashe> yep im trying it right now :) hope it will work man
[13:38:59] <tw2113> console is one of the best things to come to js development
[13:42:35] <FriendlySeal> no wai
[13:42:38] <FriendlySeal> alert is fine
[13:42:45] <FriendlySeal> alert() is best
[13:43:36] <tw2113> wow, an 87.5% success rate for spelling words
[13:44:33] <FriendlySeal> wow 99% tards on irc
[13:45:15] <tw2113> is it really so bad that i want to understand you in case you end up offering good information to everyone?
[13:46:47] * __joshua__ 2 cents. debugger > console
[13:46:49] <FriendlySeal> lets all get crazy now
[13:47:10] <FriendlySeal> __joshua__, debugger?
[13:47:24] <FriendlySeal> link?
[13:47:25] <__joshua__> yeah, the keyword debugger.
[13:47:44] <__joshua__> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger
[13:48:18] <FriendlySeal> __joshua__, which one u use
[13:48:42] <__joshua__> um, the first one?
[13:49:31] <FriendlySeal> where do i dl it
[13:49:54] <__joshua__> what browser are you using?
[13:50:00] <FriendlySeal> iceweasel
[13:51:56] <__joshua__> so, do use it.  put the word 'debugger' somewhere in your code.  done
[13:52:23] <FriendlySeal> ooo leme try
[13:52:42] <Tomashe> weird it gives me done. is undefined
[13:53:28] <FriendlySeal> cool
[13:53:34] <FriendlySeal> i see the current functions info?
[13:53:44] <FriendlySeal> i see vars this and self
[13:53:53] <FriendlySeal> and arguments rOptions
[13:54:27] <rmurphey> Tomashe: can you put your code somewhere?
[13:55:41] <Tomashe> hmm
[13:59:45] <Tomashe> yes
[14:00:26] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/L5vU7/
[14:00:59] <rmurphey> don't return in the done
[14:01:24] <__joshua__> the deferred is superfluous
[14:01:25] <rmurphey> return 4.ajax
[14:01:34] <Tomashe> wait wait
[14:01:37] <rmurphey> http://jsfiddle.net/WKCf5/
[14:02:04] <__joshua__> what are you trying to achieve, tomashe:?
[14:02:06] <rmurphey> Tomashe: i would recommend that you pause and spend a few hours reading about promises and deferreds and understanding them
[14:02:40] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/WKCf5/1/
[14:02:42] <Tomashe> this is the original
[14:02:47] <Tomashe> without me trying do to stuff
[14:03:13] <rmurphey> here is an article that i wrote about deferreds a long time ago http://rmurphey.com/blog/2010/12/25/deferreds-coming-to-jquery/ there have been about a billion written since then
[14:03:23] <Tomashe> i just want the second function to run AFTER the ajax result came to use it in the second function as X = data
[14:03:43] <Tomashe> i will read it
[14:05:21] <shoky> Tomashe:  http://jsfiddle.net/L5vU7/2/
[14:05:45] <__joshua__> tomashe: here is a function that does a ajax request, then takes the result to do another, then again http://jsfiddle.net/WKCf5/2/
[14:06:13] <__joshua__> shoky's is probably more helpful for you
[14:06:20] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:06:42] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:06:49] <Tomashe> why not return data after the .done inside
[14:07:03] <rmurphey> because that's not how javascript works :)
[14:07:10] <rmurphey> that will return from the function passed to .done()
[14:07:11] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:07:15] <Tomashe> i see
[14:07:16] <rmurphey> but it won't return from the external function
[14:07:17] <Tomashe> ok mates
[14:07:18] <Tomashe> thanks
[14:07:18] <rmurphey> which is what you need
[14:10:21] <FriendlySeal> duuuuur
[14:10:31] <FriendlySeal> gah im so dumn
[14:16:16] <Tomashe> thanks
[14:18:53] <busla> Hey all, does anyone have a clue why bootstrap popovers would not work when used in rendering elements in a js file... but DO work in the HTML file?
[14:19:05] <busla> js file: http://bpaste.net/show/yKaHSQlLK35O8R6xJaDY/
[14:19:14] <busla> html file: http://bpaste.net/show/mHCxWKl80sTaYXFA54Nz/
[14:19:35] <busla> as you can probably see .. it´s my first night of jQuery :-)
[14:19:54] <relipse> $shimmy = $dibby; <-- is there js reference issues when using assignment? Do i need to clone?
[14:26:11] <__joshua__> can you please make a jsfiddle or something?  more fun to debug
[14:26:13] <Tomashe> Another question, there is a way to add to a json string another object directly? or i should convert it into an object and then push the object?
[14:26:35] <__joshua__> tomashe, same thing
[14:27:11] <__joshua__> $.extend(my_object, JSON.parse(some_json_string));
[14:27:39] <Tomashe> i see
[14:28:16] <Tomashe> why extend?
[14:28:18] <Tomashe> why not push or something
[14:28:57] <__joshua__> push is only defined for arrays
[14:29:48] <Tomashe> ok so how do i put at the begining of my object a new object
[14:30:09] <Tomashe> append?
[14:30:10] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:30:56] <Tomashe> add?
[14:31:01] <shoky> objects don't have a beginning. be more precise
[14:31:04] <__joshua__> beginning?
[14:31:25] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:31:30] <__joshua__> do you have an object, or a special object called an array?
[14:31:32] <FriendlySeal> .shift
[14:31:43] <FriendlySeal> will apend to front
[14:31:50] <shoky> shift is for arrays as well
[14:31:55] <Tomashe> let say i got { "test":"1" },{"test2":"2"} when i loop it "test" output first
[14:32:06] <FriendlySeal> thats a array
[14:32:06] <__joshua__> [ { "test":"1" },{"test2":"2"} ]?
[14:32:09] <shoky> are you forgetting the []
[14:32:09] <FriendlySeal> yes
[14:32:12] <FriendlySeal> dood
[14:32:16] <FriendlySeal> its not posible the other way
[14:32:16] <Tomashe> yeah
[14:32:18] <FriendlySeal> omfg
[14:32:19] <FriendlySeal> idiot
[14:32:27] <__joshua__> be nice
[14:32:32] <shoky> FriendlySeal: enough with the yodeling and offensiveness
[14:32:32] <FriendlySeal> calm down
[14:32:55] <Tomashe> yeah calm down FriendlySeal, first time working with json object in such a way
[14:32:59] <Tomashe> im familiar with arrays
[14:33:16] <FriendlySeal> no i was talking to ppl helping u
[14:33:24] <FriendlySeal> saying that its array of obj
[14:33:31] <FriendlySeal> like it could be something other lol
[14:33:34] <FriendlySeal> duuuuur
[14:33:43] <Tomashe> now im confused
[14:33:51] <FriendlySeal> ok look
[14:33:56] <FriendlySeal> [] list
[14:34:02] <FriendlySeal> {} obj
[14:34:02] <Tomashe> im using that $.parseJSON(data); to convert my json into object
[14:34:08] <FriendlySeal> [{},{}]
[14:34:11] <Tomashe> data = json string
[14:34:13] <FriendlySeal> array of obj
[14:34:25] <FriendlySeal> right it automaticly will do that
[14:34:34] <FriendlySeal> its all part of json format
[14:34:40] <__joshua__> right tomashe.  So, to prepend it to your array, Myarray.shift(JSON.parse(json_string));
[14:34:42] <Tomashe> So how do i insert there a new OBJECT
[14:34:44] <FriendlySeal> thats all there is to it
[14:34:49] <FriendlySeal> just push
[14:34:49] <Tomashe> ok so short
[14:34:51] <Tomashe> ok
[14:34:56] <FriendlySeal> list.push({})
[14:34:56] <Tomashe> thanks
[14:35:02] <FriendlySeal> or
[14:35:08] <FriendlySeal> list.shift({})
[14:35:26] <shoky> unshift, really
[14:35:34] <__joshua__> yeah, unshift, sorry
[14:35:37] <FriendlySeal> which one is shift again?
[14:35:43] <Tomashe> ok thanks guys
[14:36:15] <FriendlySeal> see
[14:36:23] <FriendlySeal> i turn ur average pedantry
[14:36:33] <FriendlySeal> into something useful
[14:37:21] <FriendlySeal> ohoh yas
[14:37:27] <FriendlySeal> shift is remove
[14:37:58] <FriendlySeal> Tomashe, just do like a week of c++ and ull kill all these nerds
[14:38:25] <Tomashe> ok time to test :)
[14:53:55] <perldork> Hey list.unshift() prepends to the beginning of the array, list.shift() removes the first element from the array.
[14:54:42] <__joshua__> yep
[14:55:06] <perldork> oops missed the last few lines of that whole convo :p .. derp.
[15:06:28] <Var> Hi, does anyone here know why a jQuery UI slider would stop working after the first use?
[15:06:58] <Var> I have calls to $(document).unbind(); would this cause adverse effects?
[15:41:34] <Tomashe> $.stringifyJSON
[15:41:53] <Tomashe> is that possible i get here "no method"
[15:42:15] <shoky> JSON.stringify(..)
[15:42:32] <FriendlySeal> Tomashe, stop making up syntax lol
[15:42:44] <FriendlySeal> ur not writing a book
[15:42:55] <Tomashe> hehehehee
[15:42:58] <Tomashe> sorry mate
[15:43:06] <Tomashe> :x
[15:53:01] <HenryCH> Hi guys. I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'draggable' "  trying to call draggable on a div with "$("#box").draggable();", I include the jquery library first, then the jquery UI, then that script. Any idea what could be the problem?
[15:53:14] <Tomashe> wondering, there is a way to get specific element from array like in php have $array[3] for example
[15:55:46] <FriendlySeal> same thing
[15:55:49] <FriendlySeal> in all langs
[15:55:55] <hypfer> hi, i have a div with margin 0% (not shown) on the left side. I want it to appear when the mouse is near the left screen edge. how?
[15:56:11] <FriendlySeal> in js also works for obj too
[15:56:13] <tplaner> hey guys I'm working on a fairly simple plugin, I was using bootstrap plugins as a guide, however the more I'm getting into it the more it seems like they might not be the best reference...they seem kinda poorly written?
[15:56:31] <hypfer> well.. i'll ask again tomorrow
[15:56:32] <hypfer> sleep
[15:57:48] <tplaner> the main reason they look like they might be poorly written is because they place event handlers outside of the plugin scope...which is not suggested in any plugin guides I've read
[16:01:10] <Var> I still have problems trying to get this slider in my JS UI to work... It will slide once, then not respond to any input. Has anyone else had this problem?
[16:01:37] <FriendlySeal> ya
[16:01:44] <FriendlySeal> i had same thing
[16:01:46] <__joshua__> var, are you getting a console error?
[16:01:50] <FriendlySeal> with slidetoggle
[16:02:03] <FriendlySeal> but try slideUp slideDown
[16:02:05] <FriendlySeal> that works
[16:02:14] <FriendlySeal> and fade works
[16:02:15] <Var> I do not get a console error and have not called slidetoggle; I can provide links detailing my problems on stack overflow, github, and possibly heroku in a minute
[16:02:52] <Var> Sorry, seal, I'm not sure I follow
[16:03:18] <Var> are those options I want to set when instantiating the slider?
[16:03:51] <FriendlySeal> no i duno y it doesnt work w multi instance
[16:03:57] <FriendlySeal> but the others do
[16:04:28] <Var> Strange... I'm using a single, normal slider with minrange
[16:04:34] <FriendlySeal> oh
[16:04:35] <Var> it works fine in the demo page, but not in my app
[16:04:43] <__joshua__> var, post a jsfiddle.
[16:05:14] <Var> I was told to do that last night, but I am not sure that I can implement a fiddle using the code I have since it uses a library I wrote
[16:05:36] <Var> (I'm a noob, so please understand if I say something dumb)

[16:30:19] <Designrfix> hey guys, i'm having a problem with something... i'm using scrolltofixed to float this skyscraper div but for some reason it seems to popup a bit too early when scrolling down ... ex: http://designrfix.com/resources/100-photoshop-cs6-tutorials      (the skyscraper below latest news in the sidebar)     codebin linky: http://codebin.org/view/bbc19370
[16:30:29] <Designrfix> any help mucho apreciated! :p
[16:31:53] <Designrfix> i wonder if its just me (my browser) or if someone else is experiencing it
[16:44:57] <Designrfix> woo nevermind... found an easier way :)
[17:16:38] <burnt> hi there, I can referance a css selector in jquery using $('.main-menu').css(); but what If I want to referance ".hrmenu > ul > li.item a" can I just do $('.hrmenu > ul > li.item a').css(); ? thanks in advance
[17:22:45] <burnt> wow 754 people and no one talking
[17:23:46] <Velveeta> burnt: yep, jquery will take any valid css selector you throw at it
[17:23:50] <FriendlySeal> there all bots
[17:24:40] <FriendlySeal> plus they leave their computers on and waste our energy
[17:24:50] <FriendlySeal> and polute the planet
[17:27:56] <burnt> Velveeta cool, thanks
[17:35:55] <pom_life> I've created a small program that generates an 8x8 board and iterates over each space giving it a random color. What would be the best way to create a table dom element and set the properties equal to the result of this table> ----------> http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/zrKH4/1/
[17:37:20] <Velveeta> pom_life: so your program generates the 8x8 board just in a data structure, and you want to apply that data structure to an 8x8 table afterwards?
[17:38:04] <pom_life> Velveeta: Precisely. Each td in the table with be a 64x64 square with background-color: color, where 'color' is the value of that space in the structure.
[17:39:20] <Velveeta> well, there's really only one way to do that, which is gonna be to iterate over the table, tr by tr, and td by td, and apply that color somehow, either as an inline style via the .css() function, or by adding predefined css class names to each td
[17:39:29] <Velveeta> and have those class names apply the background color
[17:39:42] <jedimind> or maybe not use a table
[17:39:52] <jedimind> and just use a list and that way you can avoid the logic of having to close a ,tr>
[17:40:06] <pom_life> Velveeta: I know I can create 8 <tr></trs> with 8 <td></tds> in it, and assign each an id... that seems wasteful.
[17:40:29] <pom_life> Velveeta: This dom element will be a "game board" for a player, so it needs to be a table
[17:40:35] <Velveeta> well, you don't need to assign each one an id unless you need to maintain an easy handle to them, if you're just assigning background color anyway
[17:40:36] <jedimind> pom_life: <ul> with 64 LIs, then li:nth-child()
[17:40:42] <jedimind> or eq()
[17:41:10] <pom_life> I'm assigning BG color right now, but eventually each tile will be an object with properties
[17:41:13] <Velveeta> but yeah, that's about the only way to do it, wasteful as it may seem, if you have a completely randomized board, you have to individually assign those values to each element of that grid
[17:41:52] <pom_life> I'm just not sure how to take a table like that, and start the iteration process.
[17:42:18] <Velveeta> i suppose you could use .index() to force each td to look up its own index in the list, and its parent (tr)'s index in that list, and then look up those indexes in your data structure to figure out what its color should be
[17:43:55] <Velveeta> something like this (at the bottom): http://jsfiddle.net/zrKH4/2/
[17:44:23] <Velveeta> er i guess you'd then have to take the value in that board data structure, and look *it* up in your applyColor function to get the actual color name
[17:44:50] <Velveeta> but you're still iterating over 64 td's doing it that way, so it's technically no less wasteful
[17:46:51] <pom_life> what exactly is .each()? I suppose i'll look it up.
[17:47:03] <Velveeta> it's just a function for iterating over a jquery collection
[17:47:09] <Velveeta> fires a callback for each element in the collection
[17:47:40] <pom_life> and .index() lists the [x] value of each td, right?
[17:48:28] <Velveeta> yep, with no arguments, it returns that element's index in relation to all of its siblings
[17:48:35] <FriendlySeal> .each can be used for any object
[17:48:44] <FriendlySeal> or list
[17:48:52] <FriendlySeal> i mean array
[17:48:55] <BillCris_> Why the hell is the html5 shiv so huge.
[17:49:22] <Velveeta> billcris_: i've only read through that thing once, but there's a lot of shit going on in it
[17:49:47] <Velveeta> i just use a doctype and a css reset and cross my fingers
[17:50:32] <BillCris_> Velveeta: Haha.
[17:50:50] <BillCris_> I think IE8 wouldn't allow you to style them if you just do that?
[17:51:18] <BillCris_> I thoguht the whole thing was basically just document.createElement( newHTML5Elements )
[17:51:45] <Velveeta> yeah, for legacy IE, you have to use the document.createElement trick, and before it encounters any in the document, or else it just won't render them
[17:52:08] <Velveeta> post IE-8, the spec says that any unknown elements should just be treated as inline unless you specific different styles for them
[17:52:19] <BillCris_> Velveeta: Truth, but I just install the shiv via bower and it was 4.7MB.
[17:52:27] <Velveeta> yowza
[17:52:36] <BillCris_> Just threw me off.
[17:55:19] <BillCris_> True Detective in 5 minutes. Awwww snap.
[17:59:04] <FriendlySeal> sounds nerdy
[17:59:06] <pom_life> Velveeta: In the example you gave me, where would I need to put the table as a dom element?
[17:59:32] <Velveeta> pom_life: that depends on where you want it to live, you'd just stick it into the dom wherever you want it placed
[17:59:56] <pom_life> Let's say I have <table id="GameBoard"></table> with 8 trs and 64 tds.
[18:00:00] <BillCris_> FriendlySeal: Oh it is.
[18:00:04] <BillCris_> Well not really.
[18:00:19] <pom_life> Would I put $('#GameBoard td') ?
[18:00:32] <Velveeta> pom_life: yepyep
[18:01:26] <FriendlySeal> luv ur passion
[18:03:45] <pom_life> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/zrKH4/3/  ----> It's not understanding tdIndex. Does it have to do with $this?
[18:05:00] <Velveeta> nope.. you had to reference currentBoard.board: http://jsfiddle.net/zrKH4/4/
[18:05:34] <pom_life> Velveeta: So many thanks. A lot of times it's the simple things that get you!
[18:05:41] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[18:06:20] <TheJHNZ> tryhing to figure out this code..
[18:06:30] <TheJHNZ> it works in one place of the site, but not another
[18:06:35] <pom_life> Using that iteration, I can simply assign each td a "javascript id" without having to give each a "css id"!
[18:07:12] <Velveeta> pom_life: you could reference it by coordinate if that's what you mean, without having to assign actual id's, yes
[18:07:17] <TheJHNZ> http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/nq
[18:07:36] <TheJHNZ> for some reason this code only works on the first menu
[18:08:05] <pom_life> Velveeta: What do you call the coordinate system that programming uses? Because of the row/index system, 0,5 is 5,0 in cartesian coordinates
[18:08:32] <Velveeta> pom_life: you just refer to it as array indexes typically, vs "coordinates"
[18:08:59] <Velveeta> so you have a multidimensional array w/ 2 dimensions, which correspond to coordinates, but you're just referencing array indexes
[18:09:03] <pom_life> I see. You work in the industry?
[18:09:10] <Velveeta> yep
[18:09:24] <pom_life> I start school in the fall :]
[18:10:11] <Velveeta> good luck w/ that :)
[18:10:29] <TheJHNZ> http://i.imgur.com/9p9wGaN.gif
[18:10:45] <pom_life> Yep. I plan on studying hard, and working on a portfolio in my spare time. I plan on having a lot of examples of my work when I apply for internships down the road.
[18:10:52] <TheJHNZ> why is the second one clicking off when you click inside the menu? code: http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/nq
[18:11:21] <Velveeta> thejhnz: is this anyplace publicly that we can see it in action?
[18:12:00] <TheJHNZ> pm?
[18:12:36] <Velveeta> sure
[18:21:02] <pom_life> Velveeta: What's the typical way to add a div into a dom object dynamically? Is it .push()?
[18:21:38] <Velveeta> nope, use jquery's append or appendTo functions
[18:21:43] <Velveeta> `api append @ pom_life
[18:21:43] <b-ot> pom_life: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[18:28:36] <relipse> Any jquery gurus in here?
[18:28:47] <relipse> Is var $nw = $from_td; using a shallow copy?
[18:29:15] <Velveeta> if $from_td is an actual object, then it's not a copy at all, it's assigning a reference to the same object
[18:29:20] <Velveeta> so if you edit one, it will affect the other
[18:29:34] <relipse> var $nw = $from_td;  $nw = $from_td.parents('td').last(); <-- IS original $from_td now totally screwed up?
[18:29:50] <relipse> $from_td is something like $('td.foobar')
[18:30:16] <Velveeta> in that case, $from_td should be fine
[18:30:19] <relipse> ok so yes that is my problem I think
[18:30:24] <relipse> i dont think so
[18:30:32] <pom_life> Velveeta: I'm trying to add a div, #UserPiece, to currentBoard.board[0][0]. I've assigned an id to each tile, and id = 0 is where I want to append the UserPiece div. I'm not sure how to reference that id in a way that I can append to, though. ---->http://jsfiddle.net/zrKH4/8/
[18:30:34] <Velveeta> you're only overwriting the value of $nw, you're not modifying the object it was pointing to
[18:30:35] <relipse> i think $from_td is getting jacked
[18:30:50] <Velveeta> nope.. if that's the case, then something else is going on to cause it
[18:30:54] <Velveeta> that variable assignment wouldn't do it
[18:31:13] <relipse> i'm going to fiddle this to prove it
[18:31:37] <Velveeta> it would be like if you said var foo = new Object(); foo = new Array();
[18:31:59] <Velveeta> you're only overwriting the memory pointer that foo is referencing, you're not modifying what it was previously pointing to
[18:32:43] <Velveeta> pom_life: currentBoard.board is just a multidimensional array, it doesn't actually hold a reference to any place in the dom
[18:33:16] <pom_life> It seems things would be easier for me if I could "attach" them, and then just modify the array. Is that not possible?
[18:33:35] <Velveeta> you could do something like $('#GameBoard tr:eq(0) td:eq(0)') to grab that specific cell, if you know which corresponding array indexes you're wanting to muck with
[18:33:51] <Velveeta> and yes, you can attach those dom references to your board, i'll modify your fiddle to show you how
[18:33:58] <pom_life> That'd be awesome
[18:34:52] <Velveeta> it's gonna involve some more in-depth setup initially though
[18:36:24] <pom_life> Velveeta: If you can comment it, I'd pick up on it a lot quicker. I mean, if you have time.
[18:37:36] <GuffyJarvis> if I have a div with an image element inside of it and I want to reference the class of that image inside of that specific div - how would I write the selector? ie; $("#divID:imgClass")
[18:39:22] <Velveeta> pom_life: here you go, with a few comments: http://jsfiddle.net/zrKH4/10/
[18:39:39] <relipse> Velveeta: ok so you were right
[18:39:40] <relipse> http://jsfiddle.net/gK24T/2/
[18:39:46] <Velveeta> guffyjarvis: $('#divID .imgClass')
[18:40:18] <relipse> Velveeta: this was the statement I was worried about: var $nw = $from_td;
[18:40:38] <Velveeta> yeah you should be fine w/ that statement, you're just telling it "for now, $nw points at the memory location where $from_td is stored"
[18:40:54] <GuffyJarvis> thanks velveeta
[18:40:58] <Velveeta> and then later you're telling it "forget where you used to point, now you point to the location of $from_td.parents('td').last()"
[18:41:02] <Velveeta> guffyjarvis: you're welcome
[18:41:24] <relipse> but velveeta, look at the function grabTd in the fiddle
[18:41:30] <relipse> if the check fails it returns itself
[18:41:39] <relipse> which could be my problem
[18:41:55] <relipse> how do i return a copy instead?
[18:42:03] <Velveeta> ahhhh i see what you're asking now
[18:42:12] <Velveeta> if you want to make an *actual* copy, you need to use $.extend
[18:42:38] <relipse> well i'm just trying to figure out why my program broke after I added <divs> inside my tds
[18:42:40] <Velveeta> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/gK24T/3/
[18:43:05] <Velveeta> oh ok, well that's a whole different question… let me take a look at the markup
[18:43:18] <relipse> that's genius
[18:43:31] <relipse> thanks for the help, i'm going to try it so i may be back in a few asking more questions
[18:43:49] <pom_life> Velveeta: Why does --->  currentBoard.board[0][0].css('background-color','black'); <--- not adjust the background color correctly? What would be the correct way to reference the element contained within?
[18:43:59] <pom_life> ohh
[18:44:03] <pom_life> I need to use .element.css?
[18:44:15] <Velveeta> pom_life: currentBoard.board[0][0].element.css( … )
[18:44:18] <Velveeta> yep
[18:44:26] <pom_life> Wow! This stuff is so intuitive.
[18:44:29] <Velveeta> relipse: no problem, i'll look at it in the meantime
[18:44:37] <pom_life> What server languages do you work with?
[18:44:48] <relipse> node.js
[18:44:56] <Velveeta> pom_life: currently just c# and nodejs
[18:45:16] <Velveeta> but i'm a front end engineer, so i don't have much reason to touch the server-side code these days
[18:45:37] <pom_life> Would you recommend node.js over PHP if I'm slightly experienced in PHP and have no knowledge of node.js?
[18:46:20] <Velveeta> relipse: this should do what it looks like you're trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/gK24T/4/
[18:46:21] <relipse> totally different pom
[18:46:41] <pom_life> Say I just want to access mySQL databases with Javascript.
[18:46:46] <pom_life> What's that, JSON? AJAX?
[18:46:54] <relipse> velveeta ummm
[18:46:59] <Velveeta> relipse has a point, nodejs is awesome at asynchronous types of tasks, like disk i/o, request/response transactions, querying db's, etc, but it's not super at cpu-intensive operations
[18:47:21] <relipse> so if you pass the TD it will return the same td
[18:47:28] <relipse> if you pass a child, it will return the parent TD?
[18:47:30] <relipse> right?
[18:47:37] <relipse> thanks for the code-review velveeta
[18:47:45] <relipse> and refactor :)
[18:47:51] <Velveeta> we typically use nodejs as a middleware layer between the client and a c# back end that queries to mssql, or if we don't need to hit the server or do anything cpu-intensive, we do it in node and offload to mongodb for noncritical storage
[18:47:56] <Velveeta> relipse: yepyep
[18:49:02] <ezl> im having trouble with .on() not binding events in IE9, running jquery 1.7 -- works fine in FF, chrome, safari.  can anyone point me in the right direction (google and SO aren't helping)
[18:49:40] <Velveeta> ezl: it would help if we knew what actual problem you were experiencing in IE9
[18:52:03] <pom_life> Velveeta: Do you do any work with canvas?
[18:53:49] <Velveeta> not really, i know how to work with it, but we don't use it for much in my product
[18:54:45] <TheJHNZ> Velveeta: how would you wait for a reply before continuing ?
[18:55:10] <TheJHNZ> like wait for a return
[18:55:14] <FriendlySeal> i made a photoshop like app in canvas
[18:55:33] <FriendlySeal> it was for realestate flyers
[18:55:33] <TheJHNZ> would the function need to be a boolean ?
[18:55:52] <FriendlySeal> it was tied to a database too for dynamic data
[18:55:55] <FriendlySeal> prety sweet
[18:56:03] <Velveeta> thejhnz: sorry, i forgot what your original question dealth with
[18:56:08] <FriendlySeal> was = is lol
[18:56:33] <TheJHNZ> oh my last question was fixed yeah :)
[18:56:55] <Velveeta> thejhnz: so you have something executing asynchronously now, and you need to be alerted when it's finished, to continue something else's execution?
[18:57:34] <TheJHNZ> well i have a function which sends a notice to the user, i want it to wait for a return to continue the other function
[18:57:39] <TheJHNZ> so like a 'are you sure'
[18:57:52] <TheJHNZ> and if they click confirm, it returns true and the original function continues
[18:58:10] <TheJHNZ> but at the moment it seems like the function is running fully and not waiting for a return
[18:58:36] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha, you should either use a confirm() dialog for that, or else roll your own and make it event-driven so that the rest of your code doesn't execute until it alerts it's ready
[18:59:17] <Velveeta> the confirm() dialog will block the execution of your code until it receives a response
[18:59:40] <TheJHNZ> oh i'm not wanting to use the browsers one
[18:59:53] <Velveeta> yeah i was about to say if you use the confirm() function, you can't control the styling
[19:00:00] <TheJHNZ> http://joshua.geek.nz/s/JHNZ02-10-15-59-57.png
[19:00:14] <TheJHNZ> (ignore the horrible button)
[19:00:23] <TheJHNZ> (the styling)
[19:00:24] <TheJHNZ> :p
[19:00:39] <Velveeta> so if you want your own look, then you'll want to bind your code that does the actual deletion, to an event listener
[19:00:57] <Velveeta> and when you display the confirm dialog to the user, if they confirm, trigger the event to cause that code to execute
[19:00:57] <TheJHNZ> hmm
[19:01:11] <ezl> I'm using .on() to bind checkboxes to recalculate a price on http://demo.rentapplication.net/customize/
[19:01:11] <TheJHNZ> well it just goes to a link
[19:01:21] <TheJHNZ> so should i just send the link to the alert box ?
[19:01:22] <ezl> it works in chrome, firefox, and safari, but not on IE 9 and IE 11
[19:01:33] <TheJHNZ> and when they click confirm it just goes to the href
[19:01:45] <Velveeta> ezl: python's throwing up at me on that link right now
[19:01:51] <FriendlySeal> stupid favicons
[19:01:57] <FriendlySeal> y dotn they ever work
[19:02:22] <FriendlySeal> ok now it works after browser close
[19:02:37] <Velveeta> thejhnz: you should store the destination url in a data- attribute on the anchor, and bind a custom click event to the anchor to launch your confirm dialog
[19:02:46] <ezl> Velveeta: oh that sounds bad. what does that mean exactly? for me a page just loads. are you seeing a server error?
[19:02:48] <FriendlySeal> stupid browsers
[19:02:59] <Velveeta> ezl: yep, TypeError at /customize/
[19:03:07] <ezl> oh cool
[19:03:29] <Velveeta> thejhnz: and then when they confirm, just grab the data attribute from the anchor, which is storing the url, and direct the browser to it (or issue an ajax request to hit that url)
[19:03:56] <ezl> (that page is normally behind an authentication wall, just tried to open it up to make it easier for debugging. but i was authed so i didn't realize)
[19:04:27] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha
[19:05:38] <ezl> Velveeta: http://demo.rentapplication.net/customize/ -- this is showing as working now for unauthed viewers for me
[19:06:05] <ezl> basically just trying to make the price update with checkbox updates. but can't get IE to recognize that the checkboxes are being clicked (those checkboxes are added to the DOM after page creation)
[19:06:21] <Velveeta> yeah that's loading better now
[19:07:25] <grafi> Velveeta http://laravel.io/bin/3mw#4-6,14-21 :D
[19:08:18] <Velveeta> grafi: was it you that mentioned laravel to me the other day? i don't think it was….. so what am i looking for in this link?
[19:08:35] <grafi> you are looking for the beatiful line highlighting ^^
[19:08:55] <grafi> click somewhere, I dare you :D
[19:09:32] <Velveeta> i just did… i don't like it toggling previous selections though, when i shift-click past a highlighted block ;)
[19:09:59] <grafi> ha
[19:10:07] <grafi> meh :P
[19:10:12] <Velveeta> ezl: so i think i see the code block in question: $(document).on("change", "#reports .checkbox input:checkbox", function() {
[19:10:32] <ezl> yes
[19:10:42] <grafi> still its working very well :)
[19:10:44] <Velveeta> and that should work for dynamic elements
[19:10:56] <Velveeta> grafi: right, w/ the exception of that bit i don't like, it works just fine
[19:11:03] <ezl> right i thought so too -- it works for chrome/ff/safari
[19:11:11] <ezl> but even ie11 just skips that block
[19:11:16] <Velveeta> ezl: and i don't currently have IE9 available to test on, i'm in the middle of migrating from my old work laptop to my new one
[19:11:35] <Velveeta> and i haven't installed my VM images for those things yet, nor my vmware :)
[19:11:45] <ezl> ok, well thanks anyways. at least it passes the initial sniff test. will keep tinkering.
[19:12:03] <Velveeta> what happens if you uncheck a box and then click somewhere else?
[19:12:18] <ezl> nothing. only the box unchecks.
[19:12:20] <Velveeta> i know that some browsers don't like to fire a change event for some elements until the value is a) changed and b) blurred
[19:12:25] <Velveeta> hm, damn
[19:13:17] <Velveeta> let me see if i haven't deleted my VM's off of my old laptop real quick, one minute
[19:13:21] <ezl> i even tried manually doing: $(document).on("change", function() {console.log("hi");}) in the debugger AFTER the elements have been inserted in the dom
[19:13:26] <ezl> and for some reason that only fires once
[19:13:31] <ezl> which was weird to me
[19:14:32] <ezl> does it make a difference if i change the scope of the first selector? instead of $(document) to something closer to where the dynamically added element is being inserted?
[19:16:14] <Velveeta> well it *shouldn't* matter, as change should bubble all the way up unless something is killing its propagation
[19:16:40] <Velveeta> now it's always best to bind as close to the container that's gonna host that content as possible, to reduce the amount of bubbling necessary
[19:19:03] <ezl> k i'll push it closer
[19:19:15] <Velveeta> well i'm loading a VM right now to try this in IE9
[19:21:56] <ezl> Velveeta: much appreciated -- i've got an ie9 instance up too that is not working
[19:22:17] <Velveeta> well hopefully mine can not work just as well as yours doesn't work :)
[19:26:18] <Velveeta> ok, i can reproduce it in my IE9, let me see if i can figure out the problem
[19:26:33] <ezl> yay! at least we have confirmed that its broken!
[19:26:38] <Velveeta> yep
[19:31:23] <pom_life> Velveeta: I've added a rudimentary control system. What would be an efficient way to check if the user was about to move out of bounds, and only run the code if the position is legal? --->http://jsfiddle.net/zrKH4/14/
[19:32:59] <Velveeta> pom_life: in the case of up, make sure they're not on tr:first, down, that they're not on tr:last, left, not on td:first, right, not on td:last
[19:35:19] <Velveeta> ezl: i can't find anything obvious about this that would hint at why it's failing
[19:35:36] <Velveeta> aha! yes i do
[19:35:48] <Velveeta> you have more than one element in that page with an id of "reports"
[19:36:28] <pom_life> Velveeta: How would I phrase that in an if statement?
[19:36:44] <ezl> hmm... doh.
[19:37:38] <Velveeta> pom_life: you'd probably want to use a switch/case statement instead, but even better would be to avoid using switch/case ever ;) http://ericleads.com/2012/12/switch-case-considered-harmful/
[19:40:08] <ezl> Velveeta: changed to .reports -- still fails in IE and works in chrome :(
[19:40:26] <Velveeta> ok, let me refresh and check it
[19:40:41] <ezl> thanks Velveeta
[19:45:39] <ezl> .
[19:51:43] <lawroy> I'm trying to get a loading text to display when loading an iframe. the code works on jsfiddle, but I can't get the same code to work in my test enviornment or on jsbin. What am I doing wrong? http://jsbin.com/farok/1/
[20:00:59] <Velveeta> ezl: so, weirdly enough, the only way i can see to get it to behave is if i use just ":checkbox" for that 2nd parameter
[20:01:20] <Velveeta> if i add any of the other path qualifiers to it, it seems to ignore that selector match
[20:04:27] <ezl> Velveeta: that makes it behave in ie?
[20:04:35] * ezl tries
[20:04:46] <Velveeta> also, if i force a breakpoint w/ debugger; in my console-attached listener, and output $(this)[0].outerHTML, i get the checkbox
[20:04:59] <Velveeta> but if i try to output $(this).parent()[0].outerHTML, it throws an error
[20:05:09] <Velveeta> and examining $(this).parents() shows me a jquery collection of length 0
[20:05:31] <Velveeta> for some reason, it's not seeing it as part of the dom, which seems impossible, since it's receiving a click event from it as part of the dom
[20:06:14] <ezl> (thats honestly above my level of understanding...)
[20:06:45] <Velveeta> well outerHTML is a valid property in IE, and should show you the markup for the current element, including itself
[20:06:52] <Velveeta> whereas innerHTML just shows you its children
[20:07:05] <Velveeta> so i was trying to make sure i had a valid path in the parent tree to match that selector
[20:07:29] <Velveeta> and it seems as if it's not even attached to the document, but it fired with $(document).on('click', ':checkbox') so it had to be attached to the document in order to trigger that listener
[20:07:55] <ezl> ok -- so the breakpoint you're adding is inside the block that is supposed to fire on a checkbox change, correct?
[20:08:51] <Velveeta> yep
[20:09:05] <Velveeta> and when i examine 'this' it's the checkbox, and when i examine 'this.parentNode' it's null
[20:11:12] <ezl> awesome.
[20:11:22] <ezl> floating child nodes with no parent
[20:11:28] <ezl> somehow magically nested all the way in the document
[20:11:41] <ezl> but still an orphan
[20:12:01] <ezl> ok, well i think i need to quit staring at this for a bit. maybe another approach tomorrow.
[20:12:08] <lawroy> I'm trying to get a loading text to display when loading an iframe. the code works on jsfiddle, but I can't get the same code to work in my test enviornment or on jsbin. What am I doing wrong? http://jsbin.com/farok/1/
[20:13:26] <Velveeta> ezl: yeah, that's about what i got out of it, some magical orphaned node that's attached enough to broadcast its events, but then not actually attached
[20:13:40] <gr_fi>  /set theme mithru
[20:13:45] <gr_fi> woop
[20:13:46] <gr_fi> oô
[20:14:35] <ezl> going to try to see if i can just do this without jquery.
[20:14:43] <ezl> Velveeta: thank you very much
[20:14:50] <ezl> my brain is toast
[20:14:56] <Velveeta> no problem, sorry it didn't work out
[20:15:13] <Velveeta> lawroy: i'm looking at yours, you should be able to do it with .on('load'), but that doesn't seem to be working
[20:17:49] <lawroy> Velveeta: I can't get it to work no matter what I do. but it works on jsfiddle for some reason
[20:24:07] <Velveeta> here you go lawroy, this seems to work: http://jsbin.com/farok/4
[20:24:20] <Velveeta> http://jsbin.com/farok/4/edit to see the actual code
[20:25:09] <Velveeta> i prefer this method though, with .on('load'… http://jsbin.com/farok/5/edit
[20:40:24] <Vaughn> hey all, had a bug/issue with jQueryUI dialog scroll bars: http://stackoverflow.com/q/21666590/1004324 - looking for a workaround, I couldn't find it in bug tracker or anywhere online
[20:41:17] <Velveeta> is this on one of the newer versions of jquery ui?
[20:42:06] <alexkinnee> Hey all
[20:42:11] <Velveeta> hey
[20:42:14] <alexkinnee> Anyone in San Diego right now?
[20:42:29] <Vaughn> no, this issue has been around since forever i think, since many years ago
[20:42:48] <Vaughn> just decided to look into a fix haha
[20:42:54] <Velveeta> vaughn: well, i know that in one of their more release minor version number bumps, they switched the way their moveToTop function operated
[20:43:33] <Velveeta> they're not using a zindex solution to move things around, they're actually moving the dialog in the document, detaching and reattaching the current dialog to the front of the line of the other dialogs, so that it sits on top of them
[20:43:54] <Velveeta> that could cause the scrollbar position to reset, the act of detaching and reattaching it in the dom
[20:44:06] <Vaughn> ah, okay
[20:44:47] <Velveeta> and i'm not sure of what a workaround would involve, other than altering the core of the dialog widget… however, you could use the widget factor to overwrite the moveToTop function itself, and call _super from within your function override to try to future-proof it
[20:45:04] <Vaughn> i've been tinkering with "saving" the scroll bar position, but haven't found a set of events that i can "attach" on to properly
[20:45:14] <Velveeta> and maybe log the scrollTop to a data attribute on it, and check for that after moveToTop, and reset the scrollTop
[20:45:30] <Vaughn> i'll take a look at that
[20:45:32] <Velveeta> yeah i'm pretty sure it doesn't broadcast any events for a move to top operation
[20:45:53] <Vaughn> thanks
[20:45:53] <lawroy> Velveeta: that works perfectly, and I finally understand the code. thanks!
[20:46:14] <Velveeta> lawroy: good to hear :)
[20:46:20] <Velveeta> vaughn: no problem, good luck
[20:50:38] <Vaughn> was able to find a lot of info with "moveToTop": http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9166
[20:50:41] <pom_life> Velveeta: You still here?
[20:50:48] <Velveeta> pom_life: yep
[20:51:17] <Velveeta> vaughn: yep, that description sounds spot on
[20:54:17] <pom_life> Velveeta: I've added movement and facing direction. I've programmed a spell called "ray" that transforms the four square in front of you in any direction red. --->http://jsfiddle.net/zrKH4/17/
[20:54:36] <pom_life> Velveeta: The problem is that if a square it targets doesn't exist, the whole thing fails.
[20:55:07] <pom_life> Velveeta: Can you use this problem to teach me a little about try/catch/finally? I think I can do an error handling to determine if the target spaces exists. If it doesn't, execute the spell minus that target.
[20:56:40] <Velveeta> pom_life: well, you shouldn't need to use try/catch/finally in this instance, you should just have it increment its x or y coordinate up to 4 times, stopping when it hits the first or last in any direction, but i can teach you about try/catch/finally regardless, although you should know that there's a performance hit for using them
[20:57:37] <pom_life> What situations would absolutely require error handling?
[20:58:01] <Jattenalle> anything that requires something
[20:58:13] <Jattenalle> err, like, a login (shitty example stay with me)
[20:58:24] <Jattenalle> if the required data doesnt exist, you really need to know
[20:58:31] <pom_life> You mean something that, were it to fail, the entire script would be pointless?
[20:58:32] <Jattenalle> since the data is vital
[20:58:37] <Jattenalle> yeah, pretty much
[20:58:49] <Jattenalle> anytime you absolutely must have something, that's where you'd do that
[20:58:53] <pom_life> I see
[20:58:58] <Velveeta> but that's typically the kind of thing you check for with a condition vs a try catch
[20:59:06] <Jattenalle> personaly, i tend to just check with a typeof or somesuch instead
[20:59:07] <Jattenalle> ^^
[20:59:11] <Velveeta> right
[20:59:28] <Velveeta> here's a decent article about try/catch: http://www.developerknowhow.com/javascript-trycatch-performance-hit/
[20:59:53] <Jattenalle> poor IE :P
[21:00:40] <Velveeta> heheheh
[21:00:47] <pom_life> Velveeta: Right now I have the targets set as four individual variables. Would it make more sense to have "Target" be a list of coordinates, and have all the coordinates in "Target" be affected? I could check if a targeted space exists before pushing it to the target Array, and at the conclusion change all the coordinates inside target to red
[21:01:34] <Velveeta> pom_life: yep, or you could just run a loop and increment your appropriate coordinate, and then check to see if it exists, and if so, fire the callback to turn it red, and just loop that 4 times
[21:01:45] <Velveeta> the first time it fails, bail out of the loop
[21:02:08] <pom_life> what's the code to check if something exists?
[21:02:21] <Jattenalle> typeof is a quick way
[21:02:30] <Velveeta> you can use if (typeof currentBoard.board[index] === 'undefined')
[21:02:45] <pom_life> sweet
[21:02:47] <Jattenalle> if(typeof soemthing!='undefined') //it exists!
[21:02:47] <Velveeta> i've found typeof to be more fault tolerant in IE also, than just comparing to undefined itself
[21:03:21] <Velveeta> if you do this: if (currentBoard.board[index] === undefined) it'll choke sometimes and say "currentBoard.board[index] is undefined"
[21:03:39] <Velveeta> and then you scratch your head and say "no shit? that's what i was checking"… and change it to a typeof check, and it works without throwing an error
[21:07:01] <pom_life> Velveeta: You know anything about python?
[21:08:21] <Velveeta> not really, that's one i haven't bothered to pick up yet, and for the past 3 years now, i've specialized entirely in front end development
[21:09:16] <pom_life> I see. There's a method for an object in python called __repr__(self) that changes an objects "tag" to whatever you return
[21:09:49] <pom_life> For example, if you have a list that looks like --> list = [object, object]
[21:09:59] <pom_life> and object is equal to well, an object
[21:10:16] <pom_life> you can set object's __repr__(self) to represent as "A shiny object"
[21:10:22] <pom_life> so whenever the list is logged to console,
[21:10:30] <Velveeta> gotcha, that sounds similiar to javascript's .toString() method
[21:10:53] <pom_life> Instead of print(list[0]) saying [Object object]
[21:11:08] <pom_life> it'll say [A shiny object]
[21:11:12] <Velveeta> right
[21:11:22] <pom_life> Is there similar functionality in JS?
[21:12:06] <Velveeta> yep, .toString()
[21:12:27] <pom_life> How would you use it to determine how an object self-identifies?
[21:12:39] <Velveeta> by default, .toString() has its own implementation that will output [object Object] or "foo" or 5 or whatever that native js primitive type has for its toString implementation
[21:13:11] <Velveeta> but you can modify that function, it's overwritable, so that if you create a js function as a constructor, you can also make its prototype.toString method return whatever you want
[21:13:17] <Velveeta> i'll whip up a fiddle to demonstrate
[21:15:10] <Velveeta> here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/3BtL4/
[21:16:28] <pom_life> Moving from python to JS, dealing with prototyping has been a challenge
[21:16:54] <Velveeta> yeah, i don't know if python has a traditional inheritance model, javascript's is based on object prototypes vs class definitions
[21:18:23] <pom_life> what are the advantages of prototyping and why doesnt javascript officialize the normal method?
[21:18:53] <Velveeta> well one advantage of prototyping is resource footprint
[21:19:48] <Velveeta> with a traditional inheritance model, you create a class definition full of member properties and methods, and when you instantiate it, you're instantiating that entire class definition into 1 instance variable
[21:20:33] <Velveeta> this can lead to huge resource bloat if you're instantiating craptons of classes, the only shared memory across those instances is if you specify something as a static member
[21:20:56] <Velveeta> with a prototype, the "class definition" is stored in 1 spot in memory, and every object instance inherits a pointer to that memory location
[21:21:24] <pom_life> That seems useful for scalability
[21:21:30] <pom_life> Which is a big deal in webdev, isn't it?
[21:22:01] <Velveeta> so if you have 50 prototype methods that just act on data properties on your object, instead of using the storage space of 50 functions * N instances + however many instance properties * N instances, you use space for 50 functions one time, and then however many instance properties * N instances
[21:22:09] <Velveeta> definitely, because we work in a black box
[21:22:24] <Velveeta> we never know what the client environment is going to be unless we're allowed to dictate those terms, which is very rare
[21:23:07] <Velveeta> we have to try to ensure that code executes w/ consistent performance on a windows XP machine with 1 gig of ram vs a windows 8 or mac or linux box that are running multi-core processors and craploads of ram
[21:23:44] <Velveeta> so prototypes are definitely handy for slimming your resource footprint, and once you wrap your head around using them properly, they're every bit as powerful as a traditional inheritance model
[21:24:28] <pom_life> when you add a method to a constructor throug prototyping, won't your code have random prototypes sprinkled throughout it whenever you need to add a new method?
[21:25:09] <Velveeta> are you talking about if you add a method to a prototype at runtime?
[21:25:25] <vardarac> Is it alright to post Heroku/GitHub links here? My code is not well suited to a fiddle
[21:25:39] <Velveeta> think of the prototype itself as 1 giant static object that everything inherits from, any modifications you make to the prototype are instantly live and available on all instances that inherit from it
[21:25:56] <Velveeta> vardarac: all we care about is being able to see a working demo
[21:44:03] <pom_life> Velveeta: Can you show me how you would accomplish this? I've fixed the "ray" spell, but now I'm implementing a "blast" spell. The initial target is a single space three away from the direction the user is faces. I want "collateral" to be the nine spaces surrounding it. Those need to be colored red too.
[21:44:17] <pom_life> eight spaces surrounding it*
[21:44:49] <pom_life> i was planning on checking if each of the 8 squares exists, and if it does, adding it to an array variable
[21:44:58] <Velveeta> that sounds reasonable
[21:45:01] <pom_life> and then changing all the variables in the ray to background-color, red
[21:45:38] <pom_life> but I don't know about checking if an object is in an array
[21:46:15] <pom_life> http://jsfiddle.net/3BtL4/1/
[21:46:59] <Velveeta> but for now, i don't have time or energy to delve into that too deeply, i've been working on an article for the past hour or so, and the wife is beckoning me to come help her make my lunch for tomorrow, and it's almost midnight so i'm about to go offline for th enight
[21:47:19] <pom_life> Oh, okay! Well I can't tell you how appreciative I am of you.
[21:47:25] <pom_life> Do you come around these parts often?
[21:52:24] <vardarac> Is there anyone here who could help me with this jQuery UI slider?
[21:52:37] <vardarac> I can change its position once, but after that it stops working.
[21:52:48] <vardarac> I can link to a demo by pm if need be
[22:00:06] <Velveeta> pom_life: i'm in here most days, yes, just say my name and it'll pop up an alert to let me know someone's calling
[22:00:34] <Velveeta> and on that note, i'm out
[22:00:46] <thepro4ever> Velveeta Velveeta Velveeta !!
[22:00:50] <Velveeta> :D
[22:01:07] <thepro4ever> do you pop up like beetle juice or state farm?
[22:01:16] <thepro4ever> one is good and one is bad, i'm not sure which though
[22:01:32] * Velveeta dangles a dollar bill on a fishing line over thepro4ever's head.
[22:01:49] <thepro4ever> you can go back to chillin
[22:02:04] <Velveeta> i'll probably still be working on my article some in bed, maybe over an episode of ds9
[22:02:12] <Velveeta> maybe
[22:02:29] <Velveeta> adios!
[22:02:40] <thepro4ever> my gawd people still watch ds9
[22:04:25] <Jattenalle> vardarac, sure
[22:40:20] <Junior> yello ;)
[22:43:09] <pom_life> Hiya :]
[22:45:54] <vardarac> All right
[22:45:59] <vardarac> I've figured out my issue
[22:46:03] <vardarac> $(document).off breaks sliders
[22:46:21] <vardarac> But why? Is there any way I can keep it from doing that after an $(doc).off command is issued?
[22:52:16] <Jattenalle> vardarac, sounds really odd
[22:52:50] <vardarac> Yeah, I have this method that swaps groups of DOM elements
[22:53:03] <vardarac> it unbinds all existing events before swapping to another group
[22:53:18] <vardarac> the problem is, it seems that jqui has its own document-level handlers that it uses for sliders
[22:53:27] <vardarac> so if i used $(document).off it breaks jqui
[22:53:30] <jphase> vardarac: sounds like you're unbinding the events that your slider needs from your document
[22:53:48] <vardarac> hmm
[22:54:07] <vardarac> can key press events be bound at the div level rather than at the document level
[22:54:14] <jphase> yes
[22:54:28] <vardarac> and those events apply to all children of that div?
[22:54:43] <jphase> they will by default
[22:54:57] <jphase> dom elements "bubble" up to their parents unless stopPropagation is called on them
[22:55:33] <vardarac> I get how that works for things like event.currentTarget
[22:55:40] <vardarac> i'm not so clear on it with keypresses though
[22:58:06] <jphase> vardarac: http://jsfiddle.net/sPLaR/
[22:58:51] <jphase> keypress event will fire on the focused input and bubble up to the parent (div in that case) where the keypress event is attached
[23:03:10] <Jattenalle> unless you stop the event propagation
[23:04:02] <jphase> yeah, we covered that heh
[23:04:26] <vardarac> Weird
[23:04:48] <vardarac> I'm playing with the fiddle right now, and have the vent listener bound to the div the text input comes in
[23:05:07] <vardarac> when focus is on input, the keypress event fires
[23:05:15] <vardarac> but when i click the div itself and try to get keypress events, nothing happens
[23:06:38] <jphase> vardarac: if you want a div to have keypress events it will need a tabindex
[23:07:01] <jphase> or most things that don't have keypress out of the box for that matter
[23:07:38] <jphase> it needs to have an active focus for the keys to work
[23:07:51] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/sPLaR/2/
[23:11:38] <vardarac> Cool, thanks... So it's as simple as, when I build jQuery elements, adding any sort of tab index to it?
[23:12:22] <jphase> for elements that don't normally accept input
[23:15:15] <vardarac> Thanks for your help jphase
[23:15:19] <jphase> np
[23:22:08] <raj> should LGPLv3 be a concern?
[23:23:02] <Cork> raj: depends on where you plan to use it
[23:23:20] <raj> can I use it like apachev2?
[23:23:36] <Cork> yes and no
[23:23:46] <raj> what's the no?
[23:24:05] <Cork> you have more demands for keeping the source open with gpl
[23:24:14] <raj> oh
[23:24:33] <Cork> you HAVE to provide the modifications, and the code that touches gpl3 code
[23:24:50] <Cork> lgpl makes a difference for dynamically linked libraries
[23:25:19] <raj> so if I modify the code, i have to distribute the original as well?
[23:25:54] <Cork> no you need to distribute your changes (if you provide the changed program)
[23:26:22] <Cork> meaning you have to provide the source if you distribute a program with gpl3 code in it
[23:26:38] <Cork> and that include the code for your changes
[23:26:39] <systemfault> he said lgpl thought, no?
[23:26:54] <Cork> as long as it is in the same program it is the same thing
[23:27:01] <Cork> like i said "<Cork> lgpl makes a difference for dynamically linked libraries"
[23:27:58] <Cork> in that lgtp doesn't viral into programs linked to them
[23:28:01] <Cork> while gpl does
[23:28:06] <vinex08> is there a jquery code that will match the box ( whatever is higher ) side by side??
[23:28:09] <Cork> *lgpl
[23:28:11] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/L4ukj/
[23:28:44] <Cork> vinex08: not natively; but yes i've seen plugins that do that
[23:29:32] <raj> thanks Cork
[23:29:52] <Cork> raj: though i'm no expert
[23:29:59] <raj> lies
[23:30:16] <Cork> so you should talk with someone if you think you might break the lgpl restrictions
[23:30:34] <raj> no, I'm just deciding on which library to use based on its license
[23:30:38] <Cork> raj: i'm far from copy right expert...
[23:30:39] <raj> I want to error on the side of being safer
[23:30:57] <raj> so I won't use LGPL
[23:31:02] <vinex08> ok thanks,
[23:31:10] <raj> because I don't know what I'll do with the script in the future
[23:31:15] <raj> I want to leave my options open
[23:31:47] <Cork> i have no problem with (l)gpl; but some companies do
[23:32:25] <Cork> though ya, mpl is prob my fav
[23:32:57] <Cork> apache is too lose and gpl is too strict
[23:33:30] <raj> what do you mean "too" loose?
[23:33:44] <raj> isn't that good?
[23:34:15] <Cork> it means someone can take your code and convert it to not open source
[23:34:17] <Cork> so depends
[23:34:35] <Cork> apache basically just say you can't sue the original developer
[23:34:44] <Cork> every thing else is fine
[23:35:03] <Cork> (there is a few other demands, but nothing to keep the code open)
[23:35:23] <Cork> mpl is a mix, it demands that the code that is made open stays open
[23:35:42] <Cork> but you are free to make close source changes, as long as you provide the open source parts
[23:59:48] <lite> So ive got a massive memleak problem and im trying to figure out if the reason is that we suck at using jquery responsibly. Do I have to manually delete handlers like $(".foo").on("barEv", func); or do these vanish when .foo gets removed ?
