[00:14:50] <dwarder> how would you run several ajax requests one after another?
[00:15:25] <dwarder> the thing is the url contain params and they are in an array
[00:15:45] <dwarder> and the amount of requests equals the lenght of the array
[00:21:19] <dwarder> the iteration in this thing is what confuses me
[00:22:15] <dwarder> if the amount of requests was known i would just .pipe them
[00:22:35] <Cork> dwarder: you would have to daisy-chain the ajax calls
[00:22:51] <dwarder> daisy-chain?
[00:22:57] <Cork> meaning make one call from the success or complete callback from the earlier one
[00:23:28] <dwarder> Cork: can you please jsfiddle?
[00:23:45] <Cork> $.ajax().done(function() { $.ajax() })
[00:24:28] <dwarder> Cork: i don't know the amount of requests beforehand
[00:24:47] <dwarder> Cork: i have an array wich contain Ajax url params
[00:25:02] <dwarder> Cork: the amount of AJax requests is the length of the array
[00:25:05] <Cork> then use a function that works through the array
[00:25:11] <Cork> and then call it from the done callback
[00:25:59] <Cork> function next(i) { $.ajax(urls[i]).done(function() { next(++i); }); }; next(0);
[00:26:58] <Krisostoomus>  has anyone tried to send private messages with soundcloudautomatically? I can send only 1 message when I open a browser, I have to close it and startagain when I want to send next message. Take a look at http://pastebin.com/n8zENZrS  .  I use this for private messaging.
[00:29:15] <dwarder> Cork: ohh, i thing i understand, thank you
[00:29:18] <dwarder> think*
[00:36:09] <nafta> anyone around?
[00:36:16] <Krisostoomus> me
[00:36:19] <dwarder> nah
[00:36:40] <Cork> ?ask
[00:36:40] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:39:40] <dwarder> Cork: maybe he feels lonly ;)
[00:39:54] <Cork> might be
[00:39:58] <dwarder> and didn't mean to ask questions
[00:40:21] <dwarder> lonely*
[00:48:34] <joroci> can i ask to ask :P
[00:49:03] <joroci> please don't hang me if i ask
[00:58:10] <SDr> hi jquery, what's the recommended up-to-date substitue for jquery.tmpl ?
[01:02:11] <dwarder> Cork: what if need to way for execution of such fucntion? can't figure out where should i put a defered object http://jsfiddle.net/gLmuK/
[01:02:19] <dwarder> way = wait
[01:02:52] <dwarder> can i use it like this $.wait(next())
[01:02:55] <dwarder> ?
[01:03:13] <Cork> dwarder: need to execute?
[01:03:28] <Cork> dwarder: what you have there is a loop
[01:04:00] <dwarder> Cork: this is your function you gave me for sequential ajax request with array of urls
[01:04:01] <Cork> dwarder: this is an async for loop http://jsfiddle.net/gLmuK/1/
[01:04:41] <dwarder> Cork: this is related to the answer you gave me earlier
[01:05:04] <Cork> for a sync format of the same would be for(var i = 0; i <= urls.length) {}
[01:05:26] <Cork> dwarder: the wait comes from the callback from the ajax call
[01:05:33] <dwarder> Cork: would for loop wait for ajax requests to finish?
[01:05:36] <dwarder> will*
[01:05:42] <Cork> no
[01:05:51] <Cork> you can't use a normal loop
[01:07:03] <Cork> dwarder: next will be called for each iteration in the loop
[01:07:37] <dwarder> Cork: i want to wait all the requests to finish (when i call next(0)) and then execute soemthig else that needs the info it got for ajaxes, i.e. $.wait(next(0)).them(my_other_stuff) ...
[01:07:55] <dwarder> then*
[01:08:05] <Cork> dwarder: does the ajax calls need to be called one after the other
[01:08:09] <Cork> or doesn't the order matter?
[01:08:10] <dwarder> yes
[01:08:12] <dwarder> it does
[01:08:24] <dwarder> hmm
[01:08:27] <Cork> then you need to run the "then" call in the if case up there
[01:09:55] <dwarder> Cork: on the second though, i think it doesn't matter if they go one after another but i need to know when they all have finished execution
[01:09:59] <dwarder> thought*
[01:10:39] <Cork> then you can collect them all in an array and then do $.when.apply(null, list).then(function() {})
[01:13:16] <dwarder> Cork: list is the list of Ajax requests? right $.when.apply(null, Ajax(),Ajax()).then(function() {}), null is by convention?
[01:13:51] <Cork> dwarder: if you have a known number of ajax calls you do $.when($.ajax(), $.ajax(), $.ajax())
[01:14:02] <Cork> but if you don't know the number you do
[01:14:19] <son> I'm trying to write some functional test that checks for the existence of google analytics pixel on the pages
[01:14:22] <Cork> var list = []; list.push($.ajax()); ... $.when.apply(null, list)
[01:14:32] <dwarder> ohh, this is cool
[01:14:45] <son> I think GA script inserts the pixel to the page
[01:14:49] <son> But
[01:15:01] <son> seems the pixel is not inserted into the DOM
[01:15:13] <son> When I view the page source, did not see it either
[01:15:35] <son> Do you have any recommendations for me on how to query for that pixel?
[01:15:54] <son> can be done also with pure JavaScript
[01:16:29] <son> The pixel looks as: http://www.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif?utmwv=9.9.9&utms=99&utmn=123456
[01:23:15] <sammych> Is $.wrap() safe to use on existing init'd widgets?
[01:25:00] <sammych> Working with a platform at work which generates widgets for you, but I want to wrap it all up in my own code
[01:25:50] <Cork> sammych: from looking at the code it looks like it should work
[01:26:00] <Cork> but i have memory of wrap breaking things
[01:26:50] <sammych> damn
[01:27:10] <sammych> guess I need to do some testing
[01:27:26] <sammych> the widgets are MVC type things
[01:27:48] <sammych> they're built with Dojo and have masses of data backing them
[01:28:17] <sammych> I have to bail now. I'll have to do some testing
[01:41:50] <Snoopal> can me someone help with submitting a form after an ajax call? http://pastebin.com/82DHM5AN don¬¥t know why, but form won¬¥t be submitted
[01:42:26] <Cork> Snoopal: $('#AccountIndexForm')[0].submit()
[01:43:33] <Snoopal> Cork: instead of return true; ?
[01:43:46] <Cork> Snoopal: return is pointless in an ajax callback
[01:44:08] <Cork> Snoopal: the callback runs after the outer event has ended
[01:44:18] <Cork> so you can't return values to it
[01:48:14] <Snoopal> Cork: did this and get error "cannot call method 'submit' of undefined. http://pastebin.com/9PjDamfd but its the same selector as above
[01:48:55] <Cork> Snoopal: then you don't have a form with that id
[01:49:18] <Snoopal> but as you can see $('#AccountIndexForm').submit( <-- it is triggered by that
[01:49:25] <Snoopal> AH
[01:49:26] <Snoopal> TYPO
[01:49:28] <Snoopal> damnit
[01:50:02] <Snoopal> thanks man! :)
[01:55:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> i love how jquery goes quiet about 2-3 hours agi

[03:25:43] <shafox> does jquery works in email like in gmail/yahoo/outlook/live ???
[03:26:01] <ShawnRisk> If go to: ecosanity.org & you click on one of the thumbnails. Then hover over another image and mouseout, does that image stay on top? If so, I want the image I clicked to be showing off mouseout. Code: http://pastebin.com/uUYQsRcd
[03:32:40] <Cork> shafox: well it should, though most clients block javascript in emails
[03:33:07] <shafox> Cork: how to embed social plugins in email ??
[03:33:11] <Acrack> hi
[03:33:29] <Cork> shadda: it's just html you can add the scripts to the email
[03:33:54] <Cork> shafox: though as it is external resources the user will have to allow the scripts for them to be loaded
[03:33:57] <Acrack> im trying to select next "li" on an autocomplete input with down arrow can someone tell me what's wrong on my fiddle please ? http://jsfiddle.net/9W5wZ/1/
[03:34:09] <shafox> Cork: does script tag evaluate at the runtime ?
[03:34:22] <Cork> shafox: what?
[03:35:12] <shafox> Cork: if I put the javascript in a script tag then would that run at the time of opening that email ?
[03:35:43] <Cork> shafox: it's html, it runs just like it normally works in html
[03:35:48] <Cork> except it won't run by default
[03:36:09] <shafox> Cork: ok thanks for clarifying :)
[03:36:41] <Cork> Acrack: http://jsfiddle.net/9W5wZ/2/
[03:37:43] <Acrack> Cork im trying to select next li of the next "ul"
[03:40:04] <Cork> Acrack: http://jsfiddle.net/9W5wZ/3/
[03:41:54] <Acrack> thanks Cork im checking it :p
[03:46:27] <Falko_> no it doesnt
[03:47:00] <Cork> what doesn't?
[03:47:18] <joroci> it
[03:47:23] <ShawnRisk> any ideas on my  question?
[03:47:23] <Falko_> jquery doesn't work in email... @shafox asked that
[03:47:24] <joroci> :)
[03:47:44] <shafox> Falko_: okies .
[03:47:45] <Cork> Falko_: jquery works as long as javascript works
[03:47:58] <Cork> and that is what i said
[03:48:09] <Cork> javascript is blocked by default in most clients
[03:48:10] <kpl> How do I check if an element has a specific "data-" attr?
[03:48:28] <Cork> kpl: you want to select based on it or check it?
[03:49:20] <kpl> I have added some "data-" to an element, andthenlater want to check if it has been added to a specific element.
[03:49:22] <Falko_> use .attr("data-blabla") to retrieve the data-blabla attribute
[03:49:28] <ShawnRisk> Cork: any thoughts?
[03:49:59] <Cork> kpl: if($(this).data('name') !== undefined) {}
[03:50:14] <kpl> If I use .attr() .prop() or data() and the attr does not exist, then I get an error. So I suppose I need to check if it exists before accessing it.
[03:50:43] <Cork> ShawnRisk: if you could create a demo (jsfiddle.net) it would be easier to tell
[03:50:59] <Cork> kpl: no you shouldn't get an error
[03:51:50] <kpl> Cork: Firebug report an error: TypeError: $(...).data(...) is undefined.
[03:52:00] <ShawnRisk> Cork: did you visit ecosanity.org?
[03:52:04] <Cork> kpl: then $ isn't jquery
[03:52:45] <Cork> ShawnRisk: i don't have time to search in live pages
[03:53:05] <ShawnRisk> oh
[03:53:22] <ShawnRisk> there is no search it is upfront
[03:56:48] <kpl> Cork: Maybe it can be solved in another way. I have created an element and added a class="ae-textfield" and an input having data-ae-width="50" to it. Then, I want jQ to process it: var textfield=$(".ae-textfield>input"); if(textfield.length!=0){textfield.each(function(){ and here I want to get my data-ae-width if it exists
[03:58:34] <Cork> kpl: do you want to do anything else with the list of textfields?
[03:58:57] <Cork> you can just do $(".ae-textfield>input[data-ae-width]") if you don't
[03:59:21] <kpl> Not except for within "each" to call some jQ passing some data-parameters
[04:00:19] <Cork> kpl: but $(...).data(...) implies that $ is not jquery or possibly a very old one
[04:00:40] <Cork> or rather the error you get from taht
[04:00:43] <kpl> I'm using "each" because I need to check for different data-properties before using jQ to transform the input to whatever.
[04:01:00] <Cork> kpl: ok, can you make a fiddle?
[04:01:08] <Cork> this is getting to be too much psudo code
[04:08:48] <kpl> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Evc4L/
[04:10:52] <kpl> If I use data("aeWidth"), then I get the value
[04:10:56] <cusco> kpl: the selector is [data-ae-width]
[04:11:06] <cusco> kpl: the selector is $("[data-ae-width]")....
[04:12:06] <Cork> kpl: http://jsfiddle.net/Evc4L/1/
[04:12:08] <kpl> cusco: Can I use multiple such selectors to get different data-properties into different variables
[04:12:41] <Cork> kpl: if you want to work with multiple values from the different input fields, it is faster to just loop them
[04:13:09] <kpl> Cork: so you just removed "data-"?
[04:13:13] <Cork> yes
[04:13:21] <Cork> data() is only for data- attributes
[04:16:23] <kpl> So this works in the fiddle, and testing if .data("something")!==undefined now also works in my app. Thanks.
[04:20:06] <dwarder> does jquery has a func that can give me day of the week (Mon, Tue, Wed etc) from date format 2013-10-11
[04:20:35] <joroci> jquery-ui
[04:20:36] <Cork> dwarder: no, but except for the strings you can get it from native js

[05:16:01] <PhonicUK> am I right in understanding that .on can apply events to elements that don't yet exist?
[05:16:22] <Cork> PhonicUK: not really
[05:16:39] <Cork> PhonicUK: you can create delegated event listeners
[05:16:53] <Cork> that listen for events that bubble up from child elements and matches a selector
[05:17:06] <PhonicUK> right
[05:17:06] <Cork> see ?.delegate for a description on how it works
[05:17:10] <Cork> ?delegate
[05:17:11] <b-ot> Cork: Older/Non-recommended way to do event delegation with jQuery. For new projects, use the second form of .on, .on(event, selector, handler) instead.
[05:17:18] <Cork> ...
[05:17:30] <Cork> yay.. they've made the bot even less useful...
[05:17:32] <PhonicUK> lol
[05:17:37] <PhonicUK> no worries I got it
[05:17:44] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[05:18:09] <PhonicUK> I tell teh container that I'm interested in click events from its yet-existant childs of a specific type
[05:18:13] <PhonicUK> and I end up with the bubbled event
[05:18:37] <Cork> PhonicUK: those event bubbles normally too
[05:18:54] <Cork> but you can add a selector that must match the target element before the callback is fired
[05:19:03] <PhonicUK> right, will this be the element that caused the event or the parent that is getting the bubbled event?
[05:19:09] <PhonicUK> 'this' rather
[05:19:52] <Cork> $('constant parent').on('click', 'selector based from the parent that matches the element your interested in', function() {})
[05:20:11] <PhonicUK> yup got it
[05:20:20] <Cork> but read the delegate page it explains it quite well
[05:27:59] <PhonicUK> ok this is cool
[05:28:19] <PhonicUK> desktop chrome knows whether or not the device has a touchscreen :D
[05:33:18] <Joey__> PhonicUK probably only when it is multi-touch? I doubt it will know when the touchscreen just works as a mouse
[05:33:36] <hirsty> Hi all in jquery can i sort a select box with window.opener?
[05:33:56] <hirsty> (JS adding to a parents alphabetically sorted select box)
[05:34:11] <PhonicUK> Joey__, no idea, not got a single touch device
[05:34:27] <PhonicUK> this is on my Surface Pro it recognises it
[06:00:37] <ShawnRisk> If go to: ecosanity.org & you click on one of the thumbnails. Then hover over another image and mouseout, does that image stay on top? If so, I want the image I clicked to be showing off mouseout. Code: http://pastebin.com/i0BhnjaL
[06:05:57] <ShawnRisk> oops
[06:33:12] <lite_> so uhm. im digging around in some very old code here trying to locate a problem where the dialog for changing passwords was running horribly. this is what i found http://pastebin.com/5cvDyUXj
[06:40:12] <Cork> lite_: what version of jquery?
[06:40:47] <lite_> the one just before .live got deprecated ?
[06:41:01] <PhonicUK> huh, this is cute
[06:41:13] <PhonicUK> you can detect if the client has a touchscreen without javascript
[06:41:18] <PhonicUK> just using a media query
[06:41:40] <Cork> lite_: depricated or removed?
[06:41:45] <lite_> removed
[06:41:56] <lite_> 1.7.1 i believe we're using
[06:41:58] <Cork> lite_: then i would recommend trying to replace live with delegate
[06:41:59] <lite_> wow this is a mess
[06:42:15] <Cork> it means changing the syntax a bit
[06:42:31] <Cork> cause that is the only costly call i find in there
[06:42:44] <aleub> PhonicUK,  u cant afaik, theres a proposal for that but nothing usable right now, best way would be modernizer or something like that
[06:42:48] <Cork> and even that shouldn't be too bad
[06:42:58] <PhonicUK> aleub, you can - I was just saying that you can :P
[06:43:21] <PhonicUK> via @media (pointer:coarse)
[06:43:26] <Cork> ya, media queries is quite competent
[06:43:42] <PhonicUK> ive used it to make my buttons bigger if I browse to my page with my tablet
[06:44:01] <lite_> i was under the impression that $overlay.find("input[name=ok_button]").button({ disabled: true }); was expensive as well
[06:44:14] <lite_> Cork:  what makes live bad/expensive?
[06:44:34] <Cork> lite_: when you want to add the live listener it will loop all the existing elements in the page
[06:44:41] <Cork> but won't use the matching results
[06:45:12] <lite_> oh boy
[06:45:29] <lite_> so why not just use .on('keyup') ?
[06:45:54] <Cork> it would be on('keyup', 'selector') but ya that works too
[06:46:14] <Cork> $(document).on('keyup', '.password-overlay .input1, .password-overlay .input2'
[06:46:24] <Cork> would do the same as your current call
[06:46:31] <Cork> except for the useless search through the dom
[06:48:31] <lite_> feels like its also a problem that on each keyup $overlay, val2 and val2 is reassigned to the same thing
[06:49:32] <Cork> most of the calls should be fairly cheap
[06:49:47] <Cork> cause they mostly just modifies classes on the elements
[06:50:42] <Cork> hmm the button calls might actually trigger reflow
[06:50:56] <Cork> and so is the text() calls
[06:51:31] <Cork> lite_: have you tried commenting out the different calls and see the effect from that?
[06:51:41] <lite_> good call :p
[06:51:49] <Cork> though yes, the code isn't pretty :)
[06:52:14] <lite_> look at the annotations the first line here was written in 2011
[06:52:21] <lite_> 3 different authors throughout the years
[06:53:08] <Cork> the problem i have with it isn't so much the age as that it should have used variables more
[06:53:28] <Cork> it is quite a bit of repetition in there
[06:53:50] <Guest26080> what will method.done do?
[06:54:30] <Cork> ?api deferred
[06:54:30] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[06:54:35] <Cork> ?api jQuery.deferred
[06:54:35] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[06:54:57] <Cork> Guest26080: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[07:03:07] <Guest26080> http://pastie.org/8472059  I have a function on line 1 and line 53 is calling that. but as its ajax function, it always returns false (as the response of ajax is returned after the function executed.). How can make the function return the boolean at line 18 AT the function call return.
[07:07:53] <monk3y> Guest26080: make the ajax call setting async: false?
[07:08:43] <monk3y> Guest26080: so it doesn't complete early and then can return the boolean.  But if that's a performance or logic issue, use promises to update whatever once the ajax is done.
[07:11:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you there
[07:11:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> any one familiar with iscroll jquery plugin
[07:12:09] <Cork> moneal: never use async: false except for in beforeunload events
[07:12:51] <Cork> Guest26080: you should refactor the code to not use return values like that
[07:15:09] <Guest26080> Cork,  then? how can i know that the ajax call was successfull or not?
[07:15:27] <Cork> Guest26080: by using the callbacks it provides
[07:15:55] <Cork> if(make_ajax_call()) {}
[07:16:05] <Cork> becomes make_ajax_call().done(function() {})
[07:16:31] <Cork> or make_ajax_call(function() {})
[07:16:35] <Cork> if you prefer that syntax
[07:18:17] <Guest26080> Cork,  do you mean .done   as a callback?
[07:18:30] <Cork> Guest26080: that is one way yes
[07:18:35] <Guest26080> hm
[07:19:01] <Cork> function make_ajax_call() { return $.ajax(); }; make_ajax_call().done(function() {}).done(function() {}).done(function() {})
[07:19:17] <Guest26080> Cork,  can you show that on my code without changing the ajax method very much?
[07:21:00] <brettfrable> anyone know how i would find the id of a visible div on the page inside a #slider section
[07:21:11] <Cork> Guest26080: http://jsfiddle.net/gqt7P/
[07:21:18] <brettfrable> and store that id in a variable
[07:21:38] * Guest26080 looks
[07:21:50] <Cork> brettfrable: depends on what you mean by visible
[07:21:58] <brettfrable> display: block
[07:22:21] <Cork> var id = $('slider div[id]:visible').attr('id')
[07:23:21] <bigbugjava> I need a tutorial for validate.js, a good one if you can. anyone has 1?
[07:23:33] <Cork> brettfrable: * var id = $('#slider div[id]:visible').attr('id')
[07:23:48] <brettfrable> you sure thats it?
[07:23:53] <Guest26080> Cork,  but how will the if() know whether ajax returned with success of failure
[07:24:03] <Cork> Guest26080: there is no if
[07:24:15] <Cork> i remove the if statement and replaced it with the callback
[07:24:41] <Guest26080> how will callback evaluate
[07:24:58] <Cork> done is called if the ajax call was successfule
[07:25:03] <Cork> *successful
[07:25:14] <Cork> and if you want error it is fail(function() {})
[07:25:34] <Guest26080> i also need line 44 to 48 inside the if (or replaced).  meaning that it will only run if ajax was successeded
[07:25:37] <joroci> yea brettfrable he and i are sure :)
[07:25:37] <Cork> Guest26080: and it is passed onto the ajax call so it will execute just like if you had defined it inside the ajax call
[07:25:42] <Guest26080> hm
[07:25:52] <Guest26080> oh
[07:26:24] <Guest26080> hm. i should move line 44 to 48 inside the .done(fucnion) then.  but now i cant. as it will loose the scope?
[07:26:25] <Cork> Guest26080: another positive part is that you can get data if you want it
[07:26:44] <Cork> Guest26080: scopes are inherited
[07:26:52] <Guest26080> get data ? how
[07:27:03] <brettfrable> 		var id = $('#slider div[id]:visible').attr('id');
[07:27:03] <brettfrable> 		$('#slide-two').click(function(){
[07:27:03] <brettfrable> 			$(id).hide();
[07:27:03] <brettfrable> 		});
[07:27:04] <Cork> done(function(data) { data })
[07:27:07] <brettfrable> that's not working?
[07:27:24] <joroci> brett put it on fiddle or something
[07:27:28] <dboskovic> I've been working tonight on a jquery plugin that allows for faux media queries on containers (not just windows). Basically you can code an element to be responsive to the context it's placed in, not just the whole window. I'd love any thoughts. https://github.com/dboskovic/contextAdaptive
[07:27:30] <Cork> brettfrable: don't dump code in the channel
[07:27:54] <Guest26080> Cork,  hm. ok I can also get (response) also? like in success: function(response)
[07:28:00] <Cork> brettfrable: also why are you going the long way over id if you want the dom element
[07:28:12] <Cork> Guest26080: that is just variable names
[07:28:17] <Cork> the content is the same
[07:28:26] <brettfrable> I'm just using that as an example
[07:28:29] <Cork> you can call it what ever you like
[07:28:34] <brettfrable> i need to do more than that depending on what div is visble
[07:28:46] <Guest26080> Corey,  oh. so data == response
[07:28:57] <Cork> brettfrable: you need to locate the element you want and make sure the element actually match the selector
[07:29:04] <brettfrable> no
[07:29:18] <brettfrable> just need to find a way to store the visible id of the div in a variable
[07:29:21] <brettfrable> then run if statements
[07:29:34] <brettfrable> depending on what div is visible on click
[07:29:38] <Cork> brettfrable: the code i gave you will grab the first visible element
[07:29:58] <Cork> but it isn't guaranteed that it is the same element your looking for
[07:30:16] <Cork> and i have absolutely no way of telling
[07:30:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone familiar with iscroll jquery plugin
[07:30:36] <Guest26080> Cork,  thanks. iam implementing it
[07:30:40] <brettfrable> its not working
[07:30:45] <Cork> Guest26080: good luck
[07:30:56] <Guest26080> thx
[07:31:08] <Cork> brettfrable: then you need to either provide more data or do some digging
[07:31:48] <joroci> brettfrable all visible divs?
[07:31:59] <brettfrable> i have three divs
[07:32:01] <brettfrable> two hidden
[07:32:03] <brettfrable> one hidden
[07:32:05] <brettfrable> on click of button
[07:32:11] <brettfrable> i want to find the visible one
[07:32:13] <brettfrable> and hide it
[07:32:13] <Guest26080> Cork,  do you prefer this http://jsfiddle.net/gqt7P/1/      or the one you gave?
[07:32:35] <joroci> so there is only one div visible
[07:33:19] <Cork> Guest26080: are those two doing the same thing?
[07:33:32] <Guest26080> yes but what is your preference?
[07:34:00] <Cork> oh now i see
[07:34:04] <Cork> the success argument
[07:34:09] <Guest26080> ya
[07:34:20] <joroci> brettfrable: http://jsfiddle.net/T72LW/
[07:34:21] <joroci> like this?
[07:34:24] <Cork> Guest26080: i personally like the deferred, cause it lets you add multiple callbacks if you want
[07:34:29] <Cork> Guest26080: but it doesn't really matter
[07:34:34] <Cork> and i use both
[07:35:09] <joroci> or http://jsfiddle.net/T72LW/1
[07:35:47] <Cork> joroci: or just $('#slider div:visible')
[07:35:48] <Cork> :)
[07:35:54] <joroci> yea :_
[07:35:55] <joroci> :)
[07:35:56] <Cork> and that was the selector i gave him before
[07:36:10] <joroci> i just retyped it and that's what came out:)
[07:36:45] <joroci> brettfrable: http://jsfiddle.net/T72LW/2/
[07:36:47] <joroci> :)
[07:36:47] <nisseni> I have got alternate images in a webshop, when clicking an image it fetches the value of an input, when clicking another image I get the value as well, however, when clicking the same image twice I don't get a returned value on the second click, any ideas?
[07:37:17] <Cork> nisseni: code please
[07:37:24] <joroci> Cork you are also a mind reader?
[07:37:38] <joroci> ;)
[07:37:48] <Cork> ^^
[07:38:15] <joroci> I need a time machine
[07:38:27] <Cork> what for?
[07:38:39] <joroci> I need to go 3 days into the future
[07:38:48] <Cork> ok?
[07:39:02] <joroci> "Somehow" i'm getting married in 2
[07:39:12] <Cork> ah
[07:39:19] <Cork> nervous huh?
[07:39:26] <joroci> like hell
[07:39:35] <Cork> congrats btw
[07:39:40] <joroci> thx
[07:41:10] <Guest26080> Cork,  multiple call backs like function ajaxMoveTask(taskId, initialParentBoxId, destinationParentBoxId, success, complete, onError) ?
[07:41:58] <Cork> Guest26080: ajaxMoveTask(...).done(function() { alert('worked'); }).done(function() { alert('yup!'); }).fail(function() { alert('nope' })
[07:42:21] <Cork> Guest26080: * ajaxMoveTask(...).done(function() { alert('worked'); }).done(function() { alert('yup!'); }).fail(function() { alert('nope'); }).fail(function() { alert('it failed'); });
[07:42:57] <Cork> Guest26080: all the done functions will be called if the ajax call succeeded, and all the fail ones if it had error
[07:43:11] <Cork> there is also an always callback that is called (like complete)
[07:43:57] <Cork> that means you can keep returning the value from the function up the parent tree and append listeners if you need to
[07:44:00] <nisseni> Cork: http://pastie.org/private/k0uqlucujl2xxi99fgzmg - I don't get the return of the productType value when I click the second time
[07:44:04] <joroci> why add more than one done callback
[07:44:04] <joroci> ?
[07:44:38] <Cork> joroci: if different part of the code in the page needs to do separate things without knowing what the other one did
[07:45:12] <Cork> it isn't often that it is usefull
[07:45:17] <Cork> but when it is it helps a LOT
[07:45:57] <joroci> i see
[07:47:08] <Cork> nisseni: you only run the code to check that value once on page start
[07:47:33] <Cork> so if it changes later on it won't be reflected by the code
[07:48:14] <nisseni> Cork: but it never changes, I'm just not getting the value in return when clicking the same .alt-image twice
[07:48:29] <Cork> nisseni: what return are you talking about?
[07:48:36] <nisseni> Cork: the value of the input
[07:48:49] <nisseni> Cork: it's simply a hidden value
[07:48:50] <Cork> logonizable?
[07:49:01] <Cork> nisseni: you don't check the input value
[07:49:05] <Soltis> Is there a reasonably easy way to take a form and convert the inputs into a data structure?
[07:49:07] <Cork> you store the state it had on page load
[07:49:15] <Cork> and then never check it again
[07:49:28] <nisseni> Cork: yeah, in the var logonizable or textable
[07:49:32] <Cork> ?api serializeArray @ Soltis
[07:49:32] <b-ot> Soltis: .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[07:49:46] <Cork> nisseni: so that variable goes undefined for you or what?
[07:50:02] <nisseni> Cork: not even undefined, I get nothing in return
[07:50:18] <Cork> it's a boolean it doesn't return anything...
[07:50:27] <Cork> it is true or false nothing else
[07:50:42] <nisseni> Cork: I've logged it in the console, and the first time I click the .alt-image I get 2 in return, second time clicking .alt-image element I get nothing in return
[07:50:53] <Cork> 2..
[07:50:57] <Cork> its a boolean...
[07:51:01] <nisseni> Cork: logonizable is boolean, the value is 2 in this case
[07:51:14] <Soltis> Cork: That's kind of the idea, but way too primitive to be entirely useful.
[07:51:14] <nisseni> Cork: yeah if the value is 2 or 4, logonizable is true
[07:51:15] <Cork> no the element might be 2
[07:51:23] <Cork> nisseni: but that only matters on page load
[07:51:32] <Cork> after that it won't affect anything
[07:51:51] <nisseni> Cork: I know, but then it should be constant true, right?
[07:52:08] <Cork> nisseni: if the input was 2 or 5 on page load yes
[07:52:24] <Cork> oppÂs
[07:52:28] <Cork> *2 or 4
[07:52:31] <nisseni> Cork: but as I'm saying, when I click the alt-image which checks if logonizable is true, then I get true in return the first click, not the second click
[07:52:37] <nisseni> Cork: you swedish?
[07:52:45] <Soltis> Cork: I suppose, however, that a selector, some mapping, and serializeArray will do the trick . . .
[07:53:23] <nisseni> Cork: but if I click another element with class alt-image I get true in return
[07:53:54] <Cork> nisseni: well to start with, you can't define variables inside if statements
[07:54:03] <Cork> they will be uplifted out of the if statement
[07:54:34] <Cork> so i would recommend doing something like var logonizable = ($('#productType').val() == 2 || $('#productType').val() == 4); instead
[07:55:26] <Cork> nisseni: the only thing i can think of that could cause the variable to be lost like you said is if the gc is finding the variable unused
[07:58:39] <nisseni> hm, doesn't that has the same effect as making the if-statement?
[07:59:16] <Cork> nisseni: no
[07:59:25] <Cork> cause the way you do it you get true or undefined
[07:59:28] <Cork> instead of true or false
[07:59:53] <nisseni> Cork: ok, tried your way, didn't work
[07:59:57] <Cork> you could add an else statement if you prefer that
[08:00:16] <Cork> nisseni: do you have the code working somewhere?
[08:00:35] <nisseni> Cork: only locally :/
[08:00:44] <Cork> try reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net
[08:00:53] <Cork> else i can't really help you much more
[08:00:59] <Cork> the code looks ok as it is
[08:02:30] <baordog> I'm trying to put an icon in a jquery-ui menu. Of course the icon wants to appear in a different line. I've tried making the <li>s inline block, or putting a div with inline block in the <li> - how would I get the images paired with the menu items, and not on a new line?
[08:03:09] <Cork> baordog: inline-block is one way
[08:03:34] <baordog> To be specific, neither of those things worked.
[08:04:00] <baordog> I'm not sure why jquery-ui would sort of ignore my div, but it appears to do that.
[08:08:09] <Guest26080> Cork,  thanks
[08:08:18] <baordog> If I put the <li> in a div, it doesn't work, and if I put the text and the image in a div it also does not work.
[08:08:33] <Cork> baordog: li's inside div isn't valid
[08:08:46] <Cork> lis can only have ul or ol as parent
[08:09:01] <baordog> I know; I was trying to see if it would work since the legit thing didn't work.
[08:09:17] <baordog> That's why I suspect that maybe, there's some special way of putting icons in a jquery-ui menu?
[08:09:54] <Cork> baordog: http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/#option-icons
[08:10:04] <baordog> No no no that's not what I mean.
[08:10:17] <baordog> As in a icon left justified to the side of each text in the menu
[08:10:32] <baordog> Menu does the icons for sub menus automatically, of course.
[08:11:02] <Guest26080> can 'click' be replaced by some page load event in $(document).on('click', '.drop-menu-button', function(e) { ?
[08:11:03] <nisseni> Cork: now it doesn't even seem to work
[08:11:05] <nisseni> http://jsfiddle.net/hQ6zU/
[08:13:55] <joroci> nisseni you got a syntax error
[08:14:16] <Cork> nisseni: you have some php code left in the page on line 31 and 37
[08:14:38] <Cork> uh 33 and 37 :)
[08:15:18] <nisseni> http://jsfiddle.net/hQ6zU/1/
[08:15:19] <baordog> http://pastebin.com/eDhvmJyZ see
[08:15:37] <nisseni> now it works, and as you see, the link disappears as I click the one already selected
[08:15:50] <nisseni> and that's because it's not returning the logonizeable state
[08:17:03] <nisseni> Cork: ^^
[08:17:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> iscroll plugin anyone?
[08:18:57] <Cork> nisseni: http://jsfiddle.net/hQ6zU/2/
[08:19:12] <Cork> nisseni: $('#' + image_id).hasClass('changeableArea') becomes false on second click
[08:19:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you around
[08:19:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you around

[08:19:41] <baordog> If you think that my markup is broken, please let me know.
[08:19:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> gotta a question for you
[08:19:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> have you heard of a plugin called iscroll
[08:19:55] <baordog> So far as I know, I'm doing this right but I need to know if jquery just doesn't allow this.
[08:19:59] <grafi> nope
[08:20:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> :(
[08:20:10] <nisseni> Cork: why is that?
[08:20:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> damn i was hoping to get some help with the new verison
[08:20:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: http://cubiq.org/fyi-iscroll-is-out-of-beta/comment-page-1#comment-40921
[08:20:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> provides the intertial scrolling and rubberband effect to anny scrolling area
[08:21:36] <grafi> √¥√¥
[08:21:53] <grafi> cool
[08:22:01] <Cork> nisseni: duplicate id's
[08:22:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[08:22:09] <Cork> nisseni: http://jsfiddle.net/hQ6zU/3/
[08:22:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> prblem is this new version is missing some stuff
[08:22:39] <nisseni> Cork: got it, big thanks!
[08:22:45] <nisseni> gotta run, thanks :)
[08:22:50] <Cork> nisseni: yw
[08:23:56] <joro> stupid disconnects :|
[08:24:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: you know about iscroll js scroll plugin
[08:24:24] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: i know of it
[08:24:43] <Cork> i've looked at it way back, but opted to not use it
[08:24:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> are you familiar with the latest code
[08:24:54] <Cork> no
[08:24:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> they just updated to 5.0.5
[08:25:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> there is a feature that is missing that I was hoping you could help me locate
[08:25:37] <Cork> well look at the source file
[08:25:44] <joro> nisseni you fixed it?
[08:25:45] <Cork> it or the documentation :)
[08:25:55] <Cork> joro: ya it's found
[08:26:47] <joro> nice
[08:29:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: doc is not ready for iscroll5 i am confused where i should look in scroll4 at the releventcdoe
[08:29:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> i mena i thin the scroll bar is dependant on the amount the end of the page is "pulled"
[08:34:38] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: sorry i can't help, i haven't use that new lib at all
[08:34:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> ugh
[08:34:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> but if you are familar with the old lirary
[08:35:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> i might be able to mod the new script to include it
[08:35:25] <Cork> well familiar in the form i looked at how it worked ~2 years ago and decided i didn't like it
[08:36:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> what you sue as alternative
[08:36:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> *use
[08:36:05] <Cork> haven't ever used it in a production site
[08:36:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmmm
[08:36:19] <Cork> native scrolling mainly
[08:36:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause i know this thing would be really usefull for people trying to build hybrid apps
[08:36:53] <Cork> my big problem with iscroll is exactly that it isn't native
[08:37:08] <Cork> and scrolling a page shouldn't be controled by js if it doens't have to
[08:37:21] <Cork> additional problems was that it broke to easy
[08:37:41] <Cork> anyway; i'm off
[08:45:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: thats the thing it runs on cs
[08:45:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> *Css
[09:05:22] <Mrgoose> In jquery mobile 1.4 is it possible to have a panel outside of a page? so that it can be shared by all pages
[09:14:47] <arschmitz> Mrgoose: yes it is possible
[09:26:01] <walidvb> guys, i'm looking for a slideshow plugin that is responsive, supports thumbnails for pager, and has good touch support.
[09:26:22] <walidvb> cycle2 has 2, but it's touch support is not 1:1. i like glide, but no slideshow
[09:29:17] <wizerda> can someone help me wriite the jquery to make this button show and hide the form? http://jsfiddle.net/25By2/1/
[09:31:28] <logikos> i'm trying to append a stylesheet to the head, which happens but the styles contained within the sheet do not affect the document... i'm doing $('<link src="URL" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"').appendTo('head');
[09:31:44] <logikos> in firebug i can see the link is added, and the file loaded if i expand it i can see the css
[09:31:50] <logikos> but none of the css rules are being applied
[09:32:07] <shoky> wizerda: you can call .toggle() or .show()/.hide() on it.. if you want to stick to the max-width like you have it, you'll need to add overflow:hidden to the form if you want the content hidden
[09:32:07] <logikos> is there some other way i need to append it to have the browser interpret the css ?
[09:33:20] <dboskovic> wizerda: http://jsfiddle.net/dboskovic/25By2/2/
[09:34:15] <wizerda> thanks
[09:34:55] <wizerda> Is there a way to do this in CSS?
[09:35:01] <wizerda> I'm not sure if this site has jquery
[09:35:30] <wizerda> It's in wordpress so I dont know it that well
[09:35:41] <wizerda> It probably doesn't have CSS in it
[09:35:56] <wizerda> I mean it probably doesn't have jquery in it
[09:37:45] <LckyBy517> ok i have a question!  using jquery ajax to call a PHP script that returns either a 0 or a 1, when it returns 1 all is fine, but when it returns a 0 instead it just like barfs and gives me no data at all in the success function
[09:37:50] <LckyBy517> any ideas why it would do that?
[09:37:53] <bigbugjava> I cant succeed to preventdefalut on form submit
[09:38:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta: your back

[10:13:28] <wizerda> Hey guys I get this error: [13:12:40.012] ReferenceError: reference to undefined property e.target.nodeType @ http://laidlawsandbox.com/logansurgical/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.8.3:2
[10:13:35] <wizerda> Does anyone know what that means?
[10:35:40] <BillCriswell> wizerda: Is that just showing up when you include jQuery or are you doing something ot trigger it?

[10:44:17] <Guest26080> I dont know why, $(document).on('click', '.drop-menu-button', function(e) {      works       but     $(document).on('load', '.drop-menu-button', function(e) { do not
[10:48:25] <NoiseEee> Guest26080: why would you ever use the second?  it makes no sense.
[10:48:53] <NoiseEee> Guest26080: on document load *what* ?
[10:49:56] <Guest26080> yes. doc load
[10:50:09] <NoiseEee> are you asking what to do when cetain elements load?
[10:50:17] <Guest26080> i want to use it as all my controls are not active until the user clicks some thing
[10:50:23] <NoiseEee> Guest26080: what are you trying to do?
[10:51:04] <Guest26080> NoiseEee,  this. http://pastie.org/8472611
[10:51:51] <NoiseEee> Guest26080: what about that?  i'm afraid i don't understand
[10:53:00] <Guest26080> the dragg drop only is possible if i click the drop down menu first
[10:54:46] <NoiseEee> Guest26080: and you want it to work immediately?
[10:54:58] <Guest26080> ofcourse
[10:55:08] <Guest26080> on the dragg drop only.
[10:55:12] <Guest26080> not on drop down
[10:55:20] <Guest26080> on click for drop down s ok
[10:55:23] <Guest26080> is ok*
[10:55:29] <NoiseEee> so use something like:  http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[10:55:49] <Guest26080> NoiseEee,  so .on('ready') ?
[10:55:52] <NoiseEee> $(function() {  //the code that initializes your drag/drop   });
[10:57:29] <Guest26080> NoiseEee,  so .on('ready')  dont work
[10:57:49] <NoiseEee> see my previous comment
[10:59:42] <Guest26080> NoiseEee,  i need .on   bind . i tried what you said already
[10:59:57] <NoiseEee> why do you need .on bind to init a drag-drop?
[11:01:10] <Guest26080> ok. tell me what alternatives do i have for 'click'  in  $(document).on('click', '.drop-menu-button', function(e) {  }); ?
[11:01:55] <Guest26080> NoiseEee,  ^
[11:02:32] <Guest26080>  what events can i use instead of click
[11:03:09] <EyePulp> Howdy folks - taking a long shot, but has anyone used this api?  It's for getting distance between US zipcodes.  http://zipcodedistanceapi.redline13.com  When I try to integrate it (testing locally) I get No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.   Here's a fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/   (try it with console open under chrome)
[11:03:57] <EyePulp> wanting to figure out if it's just me or if it's a particular aspect of the api, or something I can overcome with my $.ajax request
[11:06:58] <NoiseEee> Guest26080: that's find if you want to have something with the class .drop-menu.button do something throughout the life of your document. there's nothing wrong with breaking up what you pasted into *two* things: the drag-drop that starts on document load, and the handler for 'click' events on .drop-menu-button.
[11:07:04] <NoiseEee> s/find/fine/
[11:07:29] <Guest26080> hm
[11:07:33] <Guest26080> ya
[11:14:30] <frank_o> I got this jQuery Mobile document with two pages and a dropdown menu: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ZKeDQ/
[11:14:33] <frank_o> But how come the dropdown menu's columns only work when at page 1 or when going from page 1 to page 2, but *not* when going from page 2 to page 1? Maybe some parts of this code need to be inside pageinit, pagebeforeshow or something like that instead?
[11:21:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> NoiseEee: got a min, are you familiar with the iscroll js plugin
[11:28:19] <jedimind> noone should be using iscroll any more
[11:29:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> hwy?
[11:29:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> why?
[11:29:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause i found it usefull in a few cases esp. with hybrid apps
[11:29:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: esp. the new version
[11:30:18] <jedimind> because it solves something thats no longer a problem ?
[11:30:24] <arschmitz> Rohan_Bhangui: well for one thing it completely breaks the native ui in ios7
[11:30:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> really?
[11:30:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmmm
[11:30:47] <jedimind> -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
[11:30:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i know
[11:30:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> but will that work for
[11:30:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> android
[11:31:01] <jedimind> and dont use fixed position
[11:31:10] <jedimind> yeah that'll work for android of course
[11:31:14] <arschmitz> yes because the bottom bar disappears when you scroll down and the url bar gets small and it comes back when you scroll up
[11:31:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> also I require headers and footers like in iscrol
[11:31:21] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui that's easy
[11:31:24] <jedimind> just dont use fixed position
[11:31:27] <arschmitz> but only native scrolling not js scrolling like iscroll
[11:31:28] <jedimind> use a content area that's absolutely positioned
[11:31:44] <jedimind> .content { position: absolute; top: 50px; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 50px; -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; {
[11:31:45] <jedimind> err }
[11:32:08] <jedimind> and that's basically it, you setup a content area with 50px gutters top and bottom, gpu accelerated scrolling
[11:32:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> gpu accelerated
[11:32:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> means i add the translate3d
[11:32:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> stuff
[11:32:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> right
[11:32:30] <jedimind> no
[11:32:36] <jedimind> just -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
[11:32:40] <jedimind> makes it gpu accelerated
[11:33:08] <arschmitz> and it wont break ios 7 that way because its still native scrolling
[11:33:12] <jedimind> yup
[11:33:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[11:33:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> is there anywhere i can read up (equivilent of can i use) on -webkit-overflow-scrolling:
[11:33:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> and its compatibility
[11:33:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> i like to read the docs :)
[11:34:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh also antoher quick question
[11:34:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> how would i position the heaer and footer with respect to the contnetn
[11:34:28] <arschmitz> Rohan_Bhangui: well as far as compatibility any recent webkit browser since its a webkit prop
[11:34:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[11:34:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> but im wondering for a hybrid app i should be safe
[11:35:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> also another thing will it provide the delightfull little feature where it bounces bac
[11:36:07] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui just absolutely position your header/footer
[11:36:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[11:36:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> and the content?
[11:36:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> absolute as well
[11:37:11] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: how about http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/dist/demos/widgets/fixed-toolbars/%20with%20https://github.com/watusi/jquery-mobile-iscrollview ? :P
[11:37:35] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: how about http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/dist/demos/widgets/fixed-toolbars/ with https://github.com/watusi/jquery-mobile-iscrollview ? :P
[11:37:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: dunno if its just me ( and you guys can correct me if im wrong) but i dont like jquery mobile very much i feel its slow
[11:38:23] <arschmitz> Rohan_Bhangui: all about how you use it
[11:38:34] <arschmitz> also the new 1.4 version has many performance improvments
[11:39:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[11:39:05] <arschmitz> and iscrollview is just iscroll so still breaks ios7
[11:39:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill look into it
[11:39:15] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/2R34v/
[11:39:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause last time i checked jquery mobile it was slow as f***
[11:39:24] <jedimind> there's everything you need, pure css, good performance
[11:39:27] <arschmitz> its in RC right now final will be in a week or two
[11:39:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: im assuming i should keep the overflow auto right
[11:39:58] <arschmitz> but this really has nothing to do with your problem because JQM just uses native scrolling too
[11:39:59] <jedimind> no?
[11:40:01] <jedimind> not on body/html
[11:40:03] <jedimind> on content
[11:40:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya thats what i meant
[11:40:17] <jedimind> yeah thats whats there :)
[11:40:20] <jedimind> overflow: auto;
[11:40:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> arschmitz: for my we app i much prefer tobuild stuff ground up
[11:40:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill look itno jquery mobile, but i want to make it feel as native for each platform (ios and android) as possible
[11:41:11] <jedimind> jquery mobile is a bad horrible idea as a substitute to iscroll
[11:41:11] <jedimind> lol
[11:41:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> chUI -> http://chocolatechip-ui.com/  accomplishes just this but I want more controll
[11:41:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: we were not thinking as a replacement
[11:41:29] <jedimind> we started off the chat with not wanting to use iscroll to not encourage bloat
[11:41:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> but from a broad view on what to use for hybrid apps
[11:41:42] <jedimind> either way unless you need to deploy an app in 1 day, dont use jquery mobile
[11:41:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol jedimind you are correct
[11:41:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:42:02] * Rohan_Bhangui agrees with jedimind
[11:42:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> just wondering if can replicate
[11:42:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://chocolatechip-ui.com/
[11:42:23] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui you in toronto area ?
[11:42:28] <jedimind> mississaussage
[11:42:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> .......[stalker]
[11:42:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> XD
[11:42:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> why you ask
[11:42:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> and how did you know
[11:43:20] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: I think without jquery mobile you'll have to apply a million and one fixes to support all the various devices out there
[11:43:32] <frank_o> That's what I heard though
[11:43:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont think it will be that hard
[11:43:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> im no building a framework
[11:43:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> im build a specific application
[11:43:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: how did you know all that
[11:44:21] <jedimind> my irc client looks up people's ip addresses when i whois them
[11:44:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:44:31] <jedimind> does a geoip lookup
[11:44:32] <jedimind> im in toronto
[11:44:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> or what I do: google them
[11:44:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh nice
[11:44:38] <Guest26080> small function not working.. http://jsfiddle.net/nmHs3/
[11:44:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: good to know a fellow cad programmer
[11:45:22] <jedimind> there are a lot of them on irc :)
[11:45:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> can never find them though
[11:45:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest26080: why are you using it like that the onclick
[11:45:49] <Guest26080> jedimind,  am any one around?
[11:45:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> create an event in the js part
[11:46:01] <Guest26080> Rohan_Bhangui,  well just to check that the method works
[11:46:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> well ill show you give me a sec
[11:46:24] <Guest26080> ok./..
[11:47:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest26080: found your issue take a look at your id
[11:47:18] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: thats cool, but for app development, wont jquery mobile sweat all the small stuff for you so you can focus more on your actual app?
[11:47:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> in your html
[11:47:34] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: AFAIK you can disable all the theming and create your own native feels for whatever platforms you desire
[11:47:40] <Guest26080> shi
[11:47:41] <Guest26080> t
[11:47:56] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: plus.. it's also got jquery (the love of my life at least) in its name so..
[11:47:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: agreed, but I sweat those details and by doing it from scratch i craft the experience I want
[11:48:11] <Guest26080> Rohan_Bhangui,  still not working http://jsfiddle.net/nmHs3/1/
[11:48:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: i know of the structure vs. full theming i just choose to do it this way
[11:48:33] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: but the jquery mobile team has spent thousands of dollars on various devices for testing, surely you can't afford the same?
[11:48:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:48:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: ill take a look at it, maybe its better than i remember it
[11:49:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> its been about 6 months since i last look ed at it
[11:49:16] * Guest26080 waits
[11:49:23] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: i dont know, im debating with you because a part of me is still looking for a way out :P
[11:49:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest26080: im working on your issue
[11:49:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: i know, its a habit to get out easy way
[11:50:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> but for some reason i prefer the hard way
[11:50:07] <Guest26080> Rohan_Bhangui, ok
[11:50:09] <frank_o> one less lib is always welcomed in my book
[11:50:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> agreed
[11:50:20] <frank_o> nice
[11:51:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest26080: error showSuccessMessage is not defined
[11:52:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest26080: http://jsfiddle.net/nmHs3/3/
[11:52:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> works when i use jquery event
[11:53:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> although error when it tries to apply highlight method
[11:53:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: see i originally started with this http://chocolatechip-ui.com/
[11:53:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> it has everything I would require
[11:53:49] <Guest26080> Rohan_Bhangui,  why  not http://jsfiddle.net/nmHs3/4/
[11:54:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i would like to insert some my won code maybe even use some native elemnts such as dropdown
[11:55:08] <Guest26080> Rohan_Bhangui,   $("#message-box").highlight();      not working in   http://jsfiddle.net/nmHs3/5/
[11:56:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest26080: i dunno why http://jsfiddle.net/nmHs3/4/ doesnt work but for http://jsfiddle.net/nmHs3/5/ are you usre .highlight() method exists
[11:56:28] <Guest26080>  .highlight() method exists?
[11:58:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest26080: http://jsfiddle.net/nmHs3/6/
[11:58:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> liek that
[11:58:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: agian it goes back to rpeference
[11:59:27] <Guest26080> thanks!
[11:59:33] <Corrado> this function $(document).on('click','.nybutton',function(){ it's ok for object created via javascript?
[11:59:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest26080: np
[11:59:47] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: it looks mighty fine!
[11:59:49] <Corrado> it's like live / on right?
[12:00:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: so what sort of projects you do ..... like you work for a media company or soemthing
[12:00:17] <BillCriswell> There's so much terrible CSS out there.
[12:00:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: no doubt its beautiful...esp with the secret sauce i have for mobile apps :D
[12:00:33] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: true.. yeah, in my case though, if theres anything i like to do from scratch it's the UI, otherwise im sure i'd switch right over to your chocolatechip-ui
[12:00:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> well hybrid apps
[12:00:40] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui historically ive worked with a number of large agencies, doing sites for large brand names
[12:00:51] <jedimind> right now im working at a smaller product shop for a bit, rebuilding their mobile webapp
[12:00:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> any that i would know?
[12:00:52] <Jon--> I want to add a hover effect on the text of a checkbox. Looking online they have the solution of adding padding to the checkbox, but this is hackish and doesn't work on all browsers. Any alternatives?
[12:00:52] <Guest26080> Rohan_Bhangui,  though the toggle class with some css transistion would be better i guess?
[12:00:59] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui any brands that you would know?
[12:01:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh
[12:01:11] <Jon--> So, []  text     want a hover effect for [] or text.
[12:01:15] <jedimind> starbucks.com michelin.co.uk mcdonalds.ca
[12:01:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: ya any brands i would know?
[12:01:16] <jedimind> etc
[12:01:19] <jedimind> brb
[12:01:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol wow
[12:01:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> those are big time
[12:01:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> k
[12:01:31] <frank_o> BillCriswell: sure is..
[12:01:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest26080: what you mean?
[12:02:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: well its not mine but i found it so :P
[12:02:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: here is my web app secret sauce
[12:02:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> well hybrid app
[12:02:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> 1 thing
[12:02:34] <Guest26080> css transistion, if you togle class with jquery that had a yellow background color and the transition time in css was 5 seconds. its same as highlight
[12:02:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> steroids js http://www.appgyver.com/steroids
[12:03:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest26080: yes if you do it using toggle you have more flexibilty
[12:03:21] <frank_o> ooooh
[12:03:24] <frank_o> tasty sauce
[12:03:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[12:03:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> its fucking insane
[12:03:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> so fast
[12:03:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> built on top of phoengap
[12:03:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> and has acess to native lements
[12:03:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> including nav bar and footer tabs
[12:04:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> and its build with the apple family in mind
[12:04:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> although android support is restricted its coming up
[12:05:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: what you think? cool huh?
[12:05:25] <Jon--> I want to add a hover effect on the text of a checkbox. Looking online they have the solution of adding padding to the checkbox, but this is hackish and doesn't work on all browsers. Any alternatives? So, []  text     want a hover effect for [] or text.
[12:05:37] <Jon--> s/or/and
[12:06:04] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: oh hell yes. thanks for sharing, im definitely going for that come phonegap time
[12:06:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: and here is the beauty
[12:06:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> if im not mistaken
[12:06:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> you only need to set up environment vars
[12:06:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> and cordova and phonegap come with steroids js
[12:06:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> so no need to install that stuff
[12:06:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> Jon: not sure I quite follow
[12:07:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> text meaning the label right?
[12:07:20] <frank_o> wow :D
[12:07:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya its quite nice
[12:07:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> about 1 year old now
[12:07:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> 10 months atleast
[12:08:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: fully compatible with phoengap/cordova code
[12:08:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> so no problems with conversion
[12:08:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: thanks for the webkit scrolling stuff works like a charm on ios
[12:08:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> yet to try on android
[12:10:32] <Jon--> Rohan_Bhangui, So, on a page let's say we have checkboxes [] item1 [] item2 [] item3. I want a jQuery func to be called on hover on the [] part, or the item1 part.
[12:10:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: lol i just googled myself....i am across the first 2 pages
[12:10:38] <Jon--> The text of the checkbox, and the checkbox itself.
[12:10:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay well lets create  fiddle
[12:11:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> why dont you set up the html the way you need to
[12:11:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> so that then I can add in the functions
[12:12:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Jon--: what I do is wrap each input in  its own div
[12:12:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> that way i can just use the background proerty for highlighing
[12:12:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: only issue with doing ground up is that i will have to heavily study native interactions and behaviour not tom ention design
[12:12:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> *mention
[12:13:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i guess the primary goal is same look no matter the os
[12:13:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> esp. for ios
[12:13:19] <frank_o> yep :)
[12:13:33] <frank_o> but thats the fun part though right?
[12:13:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> Jon--: you get that fiddle up?
[12:13:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: im beginning to like you more and more
[12:13:58] <frank_o> as opposed to code and formulas :D head getting bigger and bigger till it about to *POP*
[12:14:11] <Jon--> Rohan_Bhangui, what fiddle
[12:14:14] <frank_o> thanks man
[12:14:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> creat a jsfiddle so we can code
[12:15:06] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui it works really well on android too
[12:15:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> what works well on android
[12:15:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> jquery mobiel?
[12:15:26] <jedimind> no, the example i gave you
[12:15:28] <jedimind> that you tested on ios
[12:15:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahh yes
[12:15:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay

[12:18:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> particularly for their  south american counterparts
[12:18:16] <jedimind> ah
[12:18:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i freelance right now
[12:18:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> like i just finish contract with directv

[12:19:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> or web page
[12:19:23] <hatoon> ours!, thought the page was parallax scroll and jquery
[12:19:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> hatoon: ???????????

[12:21:34] <hatoon> the link that you passed. Rohan_Bhangui
[12:21:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhh
[12:22:01] <drag> I'm trying to create a modal dialog using jquery UI, marionette, requirejs.  In the tutorial I'm looking at, it shows that the buttons for a modal/dialog are made with the Marionette Region.  Is there a way I can have these buttons be created on the View instead?
[12:22:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: this may seem a bit upfront....but i am constantly looking for contracts...even like small recoding jobs.....so like if you come across anything let me know
[12:22:44] <hatoon> jquery scroll that is also good to know.
[12:23:07] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui id have to see a portfolio or something, i do often get requests for freelance work, but have a network of developers who i know first hand
[12:23:17] <jedimind> i dont actually know what youre capable of doing just yet :)
[12:23:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol jedimind: here  is the issue i dont have much of a portfolio built and that is what i am triyng to do right now
[12:24:11] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui well when you do, let me know :)
[12:24:15] <jedimind> or if you hvae code up on github
[12:24:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> now i can show you something I coded (mind you design was not mine)
[12:24:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://higher.comuv.com/
[12:24:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> i just coded
[12:24:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> um toher exmaples of work hmmmm
[12:24:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://gethighered.ca/
[12:25:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> and i have some toher diesgns in the works
[12:25:26] <jedimind> whats your primary skillset ?
[12:26:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> im mostly front end (html, css, js/jquery) but with knowledge of backend (php, mysql)
[12:26:31] <jedimind> im not overly impressed with the html to be honest
[12:26:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> so to be general im into web
[12:26:44] <jedimind> you have some serious divitis going on
[12:26:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> the second one is fully my design and code
[12:26:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> 	http://gethighered.ca/
[12:27:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> it actually got like 200 visists / week at one point according to hte google analytics
[12:27:46] <jedimind> the last thing i did for subaru got about 200 visits/second
[12:27:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> see thats what i mean
[12:28:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> you have great lcients
[12:28:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> but you started off somehwere
[12:28:06] <jedimind> still not really impressed at all with that code
[12:28:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> someone gave you a chance
[12:28:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> a shot to impress
[12:28:49] <jedimind> i knew how to code relaly well before i got a chance to impress anyone :)
[12:29:05] <jedimind> im not knocking your work, dont get me wrong, its just not at a calibre i would be comofortable promoting
[12:29:11] <jedimind> comfortable *
[12:29:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i know
[12:29:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> what do i lack
[12:29:30] <jedimind> understanding of semantic html structure
[12:29:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> from a purely learning point of view
[12:29:45] <jedimind> knowing how to properly separate presentation from behaviour from data
[12:29:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> as in SEO stuff
[12:29:56] <jedimind> no
[12:30:00] <jedimind> as in not using divs for everything
[12:30:04] <jedimind> but using proper html tags
[12:30:10] <jedimind> not using <img> tags for things that are part of the layout/branding
[12:30:13] <jedimind> not using | in your menus
[12:30:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> like div id="header" vs. <header>
[12:30:19] <jedimind> using <nav> for your menus and LIs
[12:30:34] <jedimind> not using so many containers
[12:30:40] <jedimind> you dont need like 50% of the containers you have
[12:30:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> i guess
[12:31:19] <jedimind> code commenting
[12:31:26] <jedimind> proper indentation
[12:31:28] <jedimind> for your css
[12:31:35] <jedimind> all your javascript is behaviour centric
[12:31:40] <jedimind> rather than object oriented
[12:31:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> behaviour centric?
[12:31:47] <jedimind> yeah
[12:31:50] <jedimind> something.on
[12:31:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> ooh okay
[12:31:51] <jedimind> or something.click
[12:31:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> hm.....
[12:31:56] <jedimind> vs directives you set
[12:31:59] <jedimind> and then attach events
[12:32:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> :(
[12:32:42] <jedimind> do you know anything about yo, grunt, nodejs ?
[12:32:48] <jedimind> do you use github daily ?
[12:33:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> all of those on occasion
[12:33:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> github more frequently now
[12:33:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> nodejs and grunt im getting itno
[12:33:18] <jedimind> have you ever written a Gruntfile.js from scratch?
[12:33:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> *into
[12:33:27] <jedimind> take a look at getfireshell.com
[12:33:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> grunt im getting into
[12:33:35] <jedimind> break it down and undrestand it
[12:33:42] <jedimind> its really helpful to learn how to get a proper development stack going
[12:33:50] <jedimind> with livereload and unit testing built in
[12:33:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> 4 years i spent working with web, didnt expect to be this bad
[12:34:04] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui i built my first client website in 1996
[12:34:05] <jedimind> dont feel bad
[12:34:19] <jedimind> i still learn things every single day
[12:34:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya but still when you started building i bet you were atleast twice as good as me
[12:34:57] <jedimind> yes and no, there are two metrics to measure a good developer
[12:35:04] <jedimind> or that i use to measure anyway
[12:35:07] <jedimind> 1) technical skillset
[12:35:15] <jedimind> 2) affinity and ability to stick to something from start to finish
[12:35:19] <jedimind> that second one is more important
[12:35:32] <tw2113> 2.5) thoughts on tables
[12:35:48] <jedimind> so yes, i may have been technically better off (comparatively speaking, the technology was drastically different)
[12:35:53] <jedimind> but i had a really hard time finishing things
[12:35:58] <jedimind> id get half way through, get bored, and not want to do it
[12:36:16] <jedimind> if you have the ability to show projects that you've done beginning to end, especially with larger brands, and can show dedication and commitment
[12:36:18] <jedimind> then you're fine
[12:36:21] <jedimind> the technical shit you can learn
[12:38:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> directv app is rolling out this week
[12:38:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> tbh i have been like that: not finishing stuff
[12:38:44] <jedimind> we all have, and noone wants to admit it
[12:38:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> but recently (over the past 6 months) i can really get shit done
[12:38:47] <joroci> rohan what did you post?
[12:38:56] <jedimind> but that's the number one thing to making a really good developer
[12:38:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: ?????
[12:39:02] <jedimind> technical skillsets + hard worker
[12:39:11] <joroci> the code
[12:39:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: I have the determination..... im just waiting for a shot
[12:39:26] <jedimind> joroci we're a little off topic talking about being a freelancer etc
[12:39:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: the code for what?
[12:39:40] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui have you thought about getting employed at an agency or something?
[12:39:55] <jedimind> i mean after working for my first agency, i basically am employed for life
[12:39:59] <joroci> i mean what did jedimind see that he gave you all  of these comments
[12:39:59] <jedimind> unless i become a crack addict
[12:40:02] <jedimind> then i can only be a mayor
[12:40:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> 2 internship offers potentially for the summer working in protland or california
[12:40:07] <jedimind> joroci oh
[12:40:14] <jedimind> 	 http://gethighered.ca/
[12:40:19] <jedimind> is what i was reviewing in terms of feedback
[12:40:25] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui how old are you ?
[12:40:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://higher.comuv.com/
[12:40:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> 18
[12:40:38] <jedimind> oh pshhh
[12:40:41] <jedimind> you have plenty of time :)
[12:40:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i feel like im losing the battle against time
[12:40:59] <jedimind> you were a year old when i launched my first site
[12:41:03] <jedimind> you're not, the industry's not going anywhere
[12:41:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> your right but still
[12:41:24] <jedimind> you're*
[12:41:28] <jedimind> grammar is important :)
[12:41:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> i just want to accomplish so much by the time im out of uni
[12:41:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya I don't focus on grammar too much in irc
[12:41:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> I can write like hell
[12:42:01] <joroci> 18 the good times
[12:42:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[12:42:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: so what are your thoughts on the two links
[12:42:30] <joroci> gonna see now
[12:42:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[12:42:37] <Jon--> I want to do an event on click of checkboxes in this class http://sprunge.us/DYMM  I want to do a different event based on the id and value of the text in the checkbox. What's the best way to do this with jQuery?
[12:42:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> Jon--: did your hover thing pan out
[12:43:19] <Jon--> Rohan_Bhangui, I'll come back to it.
[12:43:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> Jon--: when you post code....always always always always use jsfiddle.net
[12:43:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> makes it that much easier
[12:43:45] <jedimind> shudder
[12:43:48] <jedimind> <div id="checkboxes"
[12:44:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: I just am going too slow.....I mean i started working with hybrid apps 2-3 weeks ago
[12:44:13] <Jon--> jedimind, Not all of us have used HTML before. :P
[12:44:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> Jon--: lol
[12:44:30] <jedimind> Jon-- not all of us need to try :)
[12:44:32] <joroci> now i understand what jedmind was talking about
[12:44:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> meaning full names
[12:44:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> bro
[12:44:46] <jedimind> im jsut playing
[12:44:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol so many haters on my sites :P
[12:44:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> i love the critism though
[12:44:58] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui noone's hating, you asked for the criticism
[12:44:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> i can stomach it
[12:45:06] <jedimind> its still better than most of what i see on a daily basis as an op in #css
[12:45:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> i love the critism though
[12:45:14] <joroci> that's true
[12:45:18] <joroci> and it's also working
[12:45:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[12:45:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> hahahaha
[12:46:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> man I have got to learn html all over again
[12:46:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> fuck
[12:46:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> man this is gonna be tough to learn stuff all over again
[12:46:36] <Jon--> Anyway, anyone help me with my question?
[12:46:38] <joroci> it's not really all over
[12:47:04] <joroci> what is your question?
[12:47:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> I want to do an event on click of checkboxes in this class http://sprunge.us/DYMM I want to do a different event based on the id and value of the text in the checkbox. What's the best way to do this with jQuery?
[12:47:34] <joroci> is that you or hom?
[12:47:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: again i just want a shot....develop and learn on the side
[12:47:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: that is Jon--
[12:48:08] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui the types of people that come ask me for freelance gigs expect to pay $150/hr
[12:48:15] <jedimind> you cant learn at the same time as charging 150/hr
[12:48:18] <jedimind> is all im sayin
[12:48:18] <jedimind> g
[12:49:55] <joroci> add an event to checkboxes and check for the id
[12:51:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol true
[12:51:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> but like if someone is will to teach me stuff i dont mind not even getting paid
[12:51:44] <wachpwnski> how can I get the length for the response of an ajax request?
[12:51:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> the education is the reward
[12:51:59] <wachpwnski> can i grab that from jqXHR.getResponseHeader() ??
[12:52:26] <wachpwnski> Rohan_Bhangui: good mentality there, especially when you are starting off.
[12:52:26] <wachpwnski> haha
[12:53:05] <wachpwnski> people complain about not getting paid for doing work that teaches them something, but then go and blow thousands on going to university
[12:53:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> wachpwnski: i do have some clients i do some work for and the pay is good but issue is that after jedimind 's assessment I am starting to doubt whether i am good enough
[12:53:39] <jedimind> just continue to learn
[12:53:40] <jedimind> `schools
[12:53:50] <jedimind> bah
[12:53:51] <jedimind> Tools to help you get up to speed (some are paid, some are free) :: http://www.codecademy.com/ , http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials , http://teamtreehouse.com/ , http://a11yproject.com/ , https://coderwall.com/welcome , http://freecourses.tutsplus.com/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/
[12:54:06] <jedimind> i do tutorials too even though ive been doing this for 17 yaers, just to see what other people are doing and how
[12:54:09] <joroci> Jon--  http://jsfiddle.net/8cs25/
[12:54:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: most of thsoe i have tried
[12:54:13] <jedimind> and i learn something new each time
[12:54:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> they taught me a few things
[12:54:25] <jedimind> tried, and going through them repeatedly with a fine toothed comb are two different things :)
[12:54:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya jedimind i am opened minded (ha see what i did there!)
[12:54:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> *open
[12:54:46] <jedimind> lol
[12:55:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> and im purely ranting now
[12:55:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> but
[12:55:25] <Joey__> I'm calling jQuery.getJSON in a timer event, the first call reaches the server, but the other calls don't, I see them pending in Firebug. Do I need to call something to reset stuff or close stuff or something in between calls ?
[12:55:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> what gets me pissed is i spent so much time and i am no where
[12:56:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> Joey__: i assume there is some sort of "killTask" command unless those requests have to be quene
[12:56:34] <jedimind> you're not nowhere brother
[12:56:37] <jedimind> you have a solid foundation
[12:56:42] <jedimind> now its time to fine-tune those
[12:56:46] <jedimind> you have only 4 years under your belt
[12:57:03] <Joey__> I first do a $.post and I see in firebug that the pagecontent gets replaced, but I assume that is a firebug thing
[12:57:05] <jedimind> i know people who have been doing this for 10 years and couldnt produce code as clean as yours
[12:57:18] <joroci> like me :P
[12:57:23] <jedimind> dont take my feedback as a negative thing, im just exceptionally picky :)
[12:57:33] <wachpwnski> how can I get the length for the response of an ajax request, can i grab that from jqXHR.getResponseHeader() ?
[12:57:36] <Joey__> Rohan_Bhangui I don't want to kill of the tasks, I want them to succeed
[12:57:54] <Joey__> I'm polling the server to see if a task on the server has ended
[12:59:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: i welcome it....i hate those that just tell me this is good stuff
[12:59:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> that means your doing somethign wrong'
[13:00:15] <Joey__> is there something better than alert to use to debug replies? like a debug.print ?
[13:00:27] <joroci> console.log()
[13:00:39] <Joey__> where does it end up?
[13:00:46] <joroci> in console of developer tools
[13:00:55] <Jon--> joroci, when loading that into Chrome I get syntax errors.
[13:00:59] <Joey__> I mean javascript in the browsers
[13:01:14] <joroci> this http://jsfiddle.net/8cs25 ?>
[13:02:03] <joroci> did you load the jquery lib?
[13:02:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: again i reallly appreciate you telling me how much my code sucked
[13:02:25] <joroci> Rohan it doesn't suck but you can improve it
[13:02:26] <jedimind> thats why im here!
[13:02:34] <jedimind> if anyone else wants me to crush them, please let me know
[13:02:36] <jedimind> im here all week
[13:02:45] <joroci> candy crash
[13:03:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[13:03:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> its good to have a fellow canadian helping/destroying another canadian (I welcome it gladly!)
[13:03:59] <jedimind> https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
[13:04:07] <jedimind> the godly guide to writing good javascript
[13:05:31] <joroci> people ask for help and disappear :)
[13:06:27] <joroci> crash them jedimind
[13:07:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> oooohhhh this looks interesting jedimind
[13:07:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind:  i dont disappear i explore
[13:08:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks for the link
[13:18:02] <anli__> I want a table thats having 3 td:s side by side of which one and each is the same width as the screen, the table will live in a div with overflow: hide
[13:18:17] <anli__> But I do not seem to get the widths right
[13:18:19] <BillCriswell> joroci: This guide makes me feel good about the JS I write.
[13:18:26] <anli__> Should the table be of width 300%?
[13:19:59] <joroci> what guide?
[13:21:13] <anli__> Oh, maybe I got it right now
[13:23:06] <joroci> \
[13:24:57] <andrew91_> what up peeps
[13:29:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> what up
[13:29:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: the guide that jedimind postated
[13:30:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> *posted
[13:32:13] <Joey__> lol I removed some spaces from the json reply on server side and forgot to adjust the content length. was looking in the wrong place.
[13:33:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: still feeling like crap lol
[13:33:33] <joroci> why?
[13:33:48] <Joey__> are there examples of really nice javascript code out there? I found that it easily becomes a mess, unlike other languages
[13:34:43] <learning> can you ask for jquery help here or is there another channel for that?
[13:34:55] <joroci> yes you can
[13:35:02] <learning> cool
[13:35:02] <joroci> as it is a "jquery" channel
[13:36:19] <saedelaere> i try to run a function after show() an element
[13:36:21] <saedelaere> http://ideone.com/qgA9H5
[13:36:32] <saedelaere> but the second show is never triggered, why?
[13:37:07] <joroci> can you fiddle it?
[13:37:12] <bigbugjava> https://www.dropbox.com/s/42tzvfppj4vh4vx/Screenshot%202013-11-11%2020.38.36.png  - some1 must have a solution for that issue, Parrllax scrolling and Box-Modal
[13:37:13] <joroci> with some html
[13:37:45] <Velveeta> my solution would be to get rid of parallax scrolling
[13:38:51] <joroci> bigbug
[13:39:09] <bigbugjava> joroci yes
[13:39:20] <joroci> ok
[13:39:27] <joroci> same
[13:39:56] <bigbugjava> Velveeta lol, why?
[13:40:02] <bigbugjava> joroci ?
[13:40:04] <joroci> yes?
[13:40:11] <bigbugjava> got any solutions?
[13:40:12] <Velveeta> because i hate parallax scrolling :)
[13:40:30] <bigbugjava> Velveeta trying to make site look new
[13:40:33] <frank_o> Is there a more proper way to name my Deferred object variables at http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Qf2cv/1/ ?
[13:41:23] <frank_o> var defers and var deferred for the same Deferred object sounds kinda strange no?
[13:41:37] <bigbugjava> frank_o just change it mate.
[13:41:42] <Velveeta> i typically name my deferreds descriptively for what they represent
[13:41:51] <Velveeta> so maybe name those 5sTimeout and 10sTimeout
[13:42:00] <learning> can someone help me out with this problem -> http://jsfiddle.net/gc2BQ/ let me know if you need more info to help out
[13:42:24] <frank_o> Velveeta: Cool. And as for the defers and defers2 arrays?
[13:42:37] <joroci> learning paste your code without the php
[13:42:46] <frank_o> Just struggling to understand the relationship between them thats all
[13:43:12] <learning> joroci: a bit hard as it's around the php thats how the slugs are generated
[13:43:42] <frank_o> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Qf2cv/2/ so far
[13:43:48] <learning> joroci: if it helps http://andrewjrobertson.com/tecusa/variety-entertainment/ here is the tabs i'm trying to fix :(
[13:43:53] <Velveeta> frank_o: well, you don't really need arrays to hold your deferreds in that case, since you only have 1 of each, i'd just get rid of the arrays altogether
[13:44:16] <Velveeta> and if you're keeping them because you plan to have more, then i would just make their names descriptive of the types of deferreds they're holding
[13:44:27] <frank_o> sorry http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Qf2cv/3/
[13:44:47] <frank_o> ah ok.. yeah I gotta have them for later down the line so
[13:44:54] <joroci> so
[13:44:57] <joroci> what is the problem?
[13:45:57] <learning> joroci: the problem is that when you press the slugs 1 after the other it's suppose to close the other ones and go the current one but it does not
[13:46:04] <learning> all tabs stay open
[13:46:05] <Velveeta> frank_o: then in that case just name them descriptively like you would any other variable.. only you know what they're supposed to represent, naming variables is like beginner stuff :)
[13:46:38] <frank_o> haha yeah you're right :)
[13:47:37] <frank_o> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Qf2cv/4/ looking like a good naming scheme?
[13:48:17] <joroci> where is the showStuff function?
[13:48:29] <joroci> it's not defined
[13:48:37] <Velveeta> frank_o: is those arrays gonna hold nothing but 5 and 10s timeouts?
[13:48:56] <Velveeta> is those, wtf, self
[13:48:59] <Velveeta> *are* those
[13:49:31] <frank_o> nono they're gonna hold a bunch of photos and stuff I think
[13:50:07] <Velveeta> what? the arrays that you're naming fiveSecondTimeout and whatnot are gonna hold photos?
[13:50:42] <frank_o> well you asked
[13:50:53] <frank_o> hehe :)
[13:51:05] <Velveeta> so how is the name fiveSecTimeout at all descriptive of what it's gonna be holding?
[13:51:10] <frank_o> the timeout thing is just a testcase thing
[13:51:33] <learning> joroci: i have defined it as a function now but still no dice :(
[13:51:50] <frank_o> say it was gonna hold timeouts though.. then the old "var defers" would be better off being named say "var timeout" and the old "var deferred" then "var timeoutItem"?
[13:52:18] <joroci> you still got erroes
[13:52:20] <joroci> errors
[13:52:34] <frank_o> or var defers => var timeoutIndex and var deferred => timeoutItem?
[13:52:35] <kheeper> Hello, here is a thing I have txt file where I put privacy policy and when I loaded with function .load() text does't have end lines. How to I fix that?
[13:52:55] <frank_o> or var deferred => var timeoutObject
[13:53:02] <learning> joroci: mind sharing what the errors are ?
[13:53:18] <Velveeta> why do i feel like this should be a troll of some kind
[13:53:30] <joroci> line 131 unexpected token
[13:53:32] <Velveeta> it's just naming variables, how is this so difficult?
[13:53:35] <NoiseEee>  kheeper: use markup instead of plain text?
[13:53:45] <joroci> element.id as the function var
[13:54:02] <joroci> Oo:)
[13:54:10] <learning> joroci: just trying it out :P
[13:54:20] <frank_o> Velveeta: yeah i guess it came off as kinda trolly. im just really obsessive about the details
[13:54:26] <kheeper> NoiseEee, Ok I try
[13:54:26] <joroci> you can't just give a name
[13:54:26] <learning> joroci: i try everything to rule it out thats how i learn i guess
[13:54:45] <Velveeta> frank_o: there's no right and wrong to how you name your variables, you're the one that's writing the code
[13:55:11] <Velveeta> the only thing you have to think is that at some point, some person is gonna have to go in and edit that code, and more than likely that person is gonna be you
[13:55:27] <learning> joroci: i mean the click function seems to work it's just that it does not close when new tab line is open :/
[13:55:31] <Velveeta> and if you go back in a year and see an array named "fiveSecTimeouts" that holds photos, how does that make any sense?
[13:55:31] <frank_o> good point, thanks a lot
[13:55:48] <joroci> fix the errors first
[13:55:58] <frank_o> hehe
[13:56:16] <joroci> also don't put the document.ready() inside a function
[13:56:30] <frank_o> but i must stress that photos was just the real world case to explain why i needed the array, totally unrelated to the timeout testcase
[13:56:53] <frank_o> you gave me the knowledge i needed to leave the nest though Velveeta so thanks again
[13:57:57] <jedimind> so this app im working on doesnt function on an iphone 3gs
[13:57:58] <jedimind> sigh
[13:58:06] <joroci> EW
[13:58:08] <joroci> oops
[13:59:17] <learning> joroci: can't i just like have it .find all the tabs some how and act from that or something :P
[13:59:38] <joroci> learning
[14:00:12] <joroci> i didn't mean you remove the $(document).ready()
[14:00:23] <joroci> just take it out from the showStuff function
[14:01:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: cause im so behind and out of date
[14:03:28] <learning> joroci: ok
[14:06:32] <bigbugjava> I need a brainer, "content" is on z-index of 300 .modal is 1050(bootstrap defalut), how come it shows it gives that : https://www.dropbox.com/s/42tzvfppj4vh4vx/Screenshot%202013-11-11%2020.38.36.png - darkness ?!? , if I remove content, it works.. but all content.. goes away, what can be the issue???
[14:07:00] <jedimind> bigbugjava we cant help you with a screenshot
[14:07:04] <learning> joroci: can't i just use a visable check and if its active hide it and go to .next ?? it should be possible i just don't know how :/
[14:09:04] <bigbugjava> jedimind, what do u need more
[14:09:16] <jedimind> really? you cant figure that out ?
[14:09:20] <jedimind> maybe ... the CODE
[14:09:21] <bigbugjava> code..
[14:09:25] <jedimind> or a link
[14:09:27] <jedimind> to the site
[14:09:36] <jedimind> or a testcase url where the problem has been replicated
[14:09:39] <bigbugjava> it's on node.js right now
[14:10:01] <bigbugjava> jedimind, u have global bootstrap link ?
[14:10:54] <learning> joroci: any ideas?
[14:18:20] <learning> joroci: i updated the fiddle to show it more clear http://jsfiddle.net/gc2BQ/3/
[14:18:37] <learning> does anyone mind helping me with this jquery function please
[14:30:25] <shoky> learning:  $(".nav nav-tabs")  means to look for a <nav-tabs> element which is inside a class="nav" element
[14:31:27] <shoky> $(".nav.nav-tabs") will look for both classes on the same element
[14:32:41] <shoky> learning: also don't use onclick attributes in your html. use a jquery click handler
[14:34:29] <tiglionabbit> I'm trying to use jquery-ui drag and drop to drag between two lists.  The lists are both absolutely positioned and have overflow:scroll.  When I try to drag an item out of one list, it gets clipped
[14:34:37] <tiglionabbit> by the overflow rule
[14:34:41] <learning> shoky: i have changed so i just jquery click handler and changed the nav but no dice this is what i want to achive http://jsfiddle.net/RX5J6/6/
[14:34:57] <tiglionabbit> people suggest using appendTo:"body" but it doesn't seem to do anything
[14:35:14] <tw2113> shoky, question for you
[14:35:35] <tw2113> should i be able to fetch image data out of an upload input, and display it on a small scale
[14:35:40] <learning> shoky: mind guide me how i would make use of that to achive my goal ?
[14:35:50] <tw2113> after they've hit "browse" and selected an image
[14:37:56] <shoky> tw2113: i dunno, haven't messed with that stuff in a while
[14:38:12] <tw2113> just figured i'd give it a ?, i'll research

[15:15:38] <shoky> Ullarah: not sure what you mean
[15:15:58] <tw2113> hey sets overflow-y: auto on hover only
[15:16:17] <shoky> oh i see the jump now
[15:16:36] <Ullarah> shoky: I tried setting overflow-y to scoll but I'm kinda stumped :/
[15:16:44] <Ullarah> It's probably something really easy, haha.
[15:19:37] <Ullarah> Oh geez. It was something simple.
[15:19:47] <Ullarah> Moved overflow to the main tag...
[15:19:51] <Ullarah> I'll see myself out.

[15:22:48] <versatiletech> I'm working with a 3rd party service that injects an iframe into my page that has a button. Could I attach an event to that button?
[15:23:19] <versatiletech> or will I have a cross-domain policy type of issue
[15:24:17] <shoky> versatiletech: not likely that you can do it
[15:26:01] <learning> shoky: nice ;) may i ask did you change the css and any of the html or just add the js?
[15:26:37] <shoky> learning: i made few changes in the css yea, you can ignore the top change i made with box-sizing. and from the html i think i just removed the onclicks
[15:30:19] <learning> shoky: it's strange it works in fiddle but when i impliment to the site it wont open :/

[15:30:51] <shoky> er
[15:31:12] <shoky> learning: you're including jquery and jquery ui like 5 times, at least
[15:32:00] <learning> shoky: yeah cause i have it in a plugin it's messing with the print out
[15:36:45] <shoky> learning: you also have the same code in <script> tags... multiple times, doing the same thing.. adding multiple click handlers to all the links
[15:36:50] <shoky> clean up your shit ;p

[15:49:05] <Ring0`> Hi. I have: var show = function(what){ alert(what) }; $('#mydiv').on('click', show); How can I pass "what" argument/param to "show()" ?
[15:49:23] <Ring0`> Do I have to wrap it inside primitive function inside .on() ?
[15:49:35] <Ring0`> or is there any 'nicer' approach?
[15:51:53] <shoky> Ring0`: you can send extra data to the event handler using the 'data' argument, e.g.   var show = function(event){ alert(event.data) }; $('#mydiv').on('click', show, 'i am alerted')
[15:52:39] <shoky> Ring0`: and an alternative to wrapping inside a function is to use .bind e.g. $('#mydiv').on('click', show.bind(null, 'i am alerted'))
[15:53:10] <Ring0`> thx shoky, I understand that this will work only in jquery as .on() takes third parameter but it wouldn't in plain js (addEventListener)
[15:53:18] <Ring0`> oh, then I'd use native JS bind
[15:53:20] <shoky> correct
[15:53:25] <Ring0`> ok, thanks a lot shoky !

[15:59:44] <frank_o> I got this jQuery Mobile document with two pages and a dropdown menu: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ZKeDQ/ . But how come the dropdown menu only works properly when at page 1 or 2, but *not* when going back to page 1 from page 2?
[16:04:51] <HowardwLo> How would you guys make it so that a Like button that does AJAX request, will only need to be pressed once for users who are not logged in? They will get a modal popup that asks for login, then immediately process like ajax request ?
[16:05:45] <twarden> How do I use jquery to fill in a known value to a form?  I've been trying to use forms[0][1].value="First Last"; and nothing gets filled.  The form's id is mainForm and the id of the name field is just name and the site's JS breaks when I tried to reference it with $("#mainForm").("#name").value="First Last";

[16:09:26] <sammych1> who needs 1.4 now

[16:32:37] <aagii> how to correct TypeError: $.browser is undefined?
[16:34:08] <systemfault> There's a jquery migrate plugin for that.
[16:34:31] <systemfault> If it's your own code that uses $.browser, you should simply repair it as browser detection is bad.

[16:45:51] <gremlyn> ryanneufeld, I'm wondering if it's not working because the inputs I'm trying to monitor are hidden?

[16:46:46] <cpierce> how would i get that into my jquery using getJSON
[16:47:09] <gremlyn> ryanneufeld, I'll get an example set up in jsfiddle
[16:47:27] <ryanneufeld> cpierce: getJSON is an alias for $.ajax({dataType: json});
[16:47:53] <ryanneufeld> cpierce: so, you would use it in a similar way.
[16:47:55] <cpierce> ryanneufeld: i'm calling each but i don't think thats right since i need both pieces of data
[16:48:02] <ryanneufeld> `api getJSON @cpierce
[16:48:02] <b-ot> cpierce: No matches.

[16:54:32] <HowardwLo> Is there a better way to do this? I have a like button that requires users to be logged in. If they aren't, it displays a modal login. After login, I am getting it to automatically click the like button by using a global variable "like clicked". if the global variable is true, it will run a script to manually click the like button and do the ajax request.
[16:55:30] <gremlyn> ryanneufeld, I think this has everything relevant: http://jsfiddle.net/Dtbh6/
[16:55:57] <gremlyn> sliders move, update hidden inputs, and I want something to happen on the change of the hidden fields
[16:56:04] <tw2113> ryanneufeld, why did i not realize you worked for a lyric company
[16:56:25] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: please don't call me neufy, and yes I do
[16:56:43] <tw2113> sorry on the first part
[16:56:48] <ryanneufeld> gremlyn: you're using jqueryui, there are change events, have you read the docs?
[16:56:55] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: no harm, no foul. Now you know :)
[16:57:22] <gremlyn> ryanneufeld, different from the normal jquery change events?
[16:57:37] <tw2113> y no backbone? :P
[16:57:41] <ryanneufeld> gremlyn: yes, you need to use the jqueryui events
[16:57:53] <tw2113> i'm done already
[16:57:54] <gremlyn> ryanneufeld, ok, I'll take a look, I had no idea
[16:58:03] <ryanneufeld> did you read the docs?
[16:58:04] <ahhughes> gremlyn: thats rather dissapointing :( whats the point of $.param if it doesnt go both ways :(
[16:59:58] <ryanneufeld> gremlyn: you have extended the default slider, but you should be able to use the same option. Also keep in mind that UI widgets alter your markup after their loaded. The wrap/hide/add classes where they need to in order to give the appearance that you're expecting
[17:00:11] <gremlyn> oh, ryanneufeld you're just saying put it in the slide: function()
[17:00:19] <ryanneufeld> gremlyn: if you look at the elements panel of your inspector (not view source, but the actual dev tools)
[17:00:32] <ryanneufeld> gremlyn: that's an option, but it will fire every time the slider moves
[17:00:45] <gremlyn> ryanneufeld, that's what I want
[17:00:52] <gremlyn> I was trying to do that on the hidden inputs
[17:01:12] <ryanneufeld> gremlyn: so if you move it 6 notches
[17:01:19] <ryanneufeld> you want your function called 6 times?
[17:01:21] <gremlyn> hrm
[17:01:23] <gremlyn> probably not
[17:01:27] <ryanneufeld> yeah, thought so
[17:01:34] <gremlyn> so on stop:
[17:01:37] <ryanneufeld> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#event-change
[17:01:55] <acidjazz> ryanneufeld: blasphemy
[17:02:30] <ryanneufeld> gremlyn: stop may be what you're after yes
[17:02:33] <gremlyn> that'll be a much better way to do it, thanks
[17:02:33] <ryanneufeld> acidjazz: I'm sorry?
[17:02:52] <ryanneufeld> gremlyn: Good luck
[17:05:13] <gremlyn> ryanneufeld, working perfectly
[17:10:09] <ahhughes> gremlyn: deparam.... http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/
[17:10:50] <gremlyn> ahhughes, not really sure why one isn't built into jquery by default, but that looks like it'll work
[17:39:39] <aagii> anybody know about jquery-migrate-plugin?
[17:41:58] <aagii> should i not to correct old js codes after update jquery to 1.10.2 ?
[17:51:42] <shoky> aagii: what?
[19:44:52] <bluesm> What "As some default styles hinge on fieldcontains, note that you may have to ensure that custom styles apply to switches within fieldcontains by using .ui-field-contain div.ui-slider-switch { width: [‚Ä¶]; }."
[19:44:55] <bluesm> Does maen ?
[19:44:57] <bluesm> mean ?
[19:45:24] <bluesm> "hinge on fieldcontains" ? http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/switch/index.html
[21:12:42] <sammych1> I know why this happens but I'm putting this out there to see if there's a possible solution/workaround: I have a $.draggable that sits on the right side. On some pages there's a iFrame (for jQM page) takes up the full width and most of the height
[21:13:17] <sammych1> the problem comes when you drag faster than the element moves, and your cursor lands in iFrame territory
[21:13:30] <sammych1> bye bye drag.
[21:13:54] <sammych1> only just thought of this as I was typing, actually
[21:14:14] <sammych1> maybe I could throw down a clear div over the whole page right below the draggable
[21:14:25] <sammych1> that'll do it?
[21:14:38] <sammych1> *while dragging
[22:07:25] <sayd> anyone using the live connect stuff from ms? im trying to build an oauth flow to outlook
[22:10:57] <sammych1> bloody geneus!
[22:11:01] <sammych1> ;)

[23:12:53] <Ropt> How can create an event handlers that catches all events triggered on an element set?
[23:13:28] <Ropt> How can I create an event handler*...
[23:19:04] <jop008> How do we handle data inputs? The format of the date string depends on the browser settings
[23:19:58] <jop008> My db wants this yyyy-mm-dd how to handle the mapping?
[23:21:40] <lite_> i am at my wits end here trying to narrow in on the issue causing this event to take 12 seconds to execute. it only happens on two input fields and only when i delete the last character in said input fields...

[23:23:22] <lemonsparrow> hi
[23:26:04] <lemonsparrow> how to append this http://pastebin.com/L0PX7DsJ pls help.. thanks
[23:27:03] <Ropt> lite_: what event? can you replicate the problem in a fiddle? is the event doing an ajax call?
[23:30:47] <lite_> Ropt: i wish I knew. All I see in the timeline is what I posted
[23:30:56] <lite_> a keydown event taking 12 seconds to finish
[23:31:09] <jop008> how to find out date format is yyyy-mmd-dd or dd-mm-yyyy?
[23:31:39] <guzzlefry> Hello
[23:32:09] <guzzlefry> I'm trying to use jquery ui's dialogs. Is there a way to prevent it from destroying the DOM element that they display when closing?
[23:37:27] <Cork> guzzlefry: don't close it :)
[23:37:47] <Cork> guzzlefry: wait dialog('close') shouldn't destroy anything
[23:38:37] <guzzlefry> ah
[23:38:39] <guzzlefry> wonder why
[23:39:11] <Cork> you might have something that listen for the close event?
[23:39:25] <guzzlefry> shouldn't
[23:39:35] <guzzlefry> Cork: would modal: true affect it?
[23:39:41] <Cork> jop008: string[4] == '-'
[23:40:33] <Cork> guzzlefry: not the dialog, but it creates an overlay that it shows behind, and yes that one is created and destroyed
[23:41:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then do just that
[23:41:26] <guzzlefry> Cork: Here's the code: http://bpaste.net/show/fWdxSU4fl3UZx2BCSk1w/
[23:41:50] <guzzlefry> It seems to be destroying .modal-dialog.
[23:42:04] <Cork> and what is destroying it?
[23:42:20] <Cork> ah
[23:42:20] <Cork> no it doesn't
[23:42:20] <Cork> but it moves it
[23:42:34] <Cork> the element is moved out to the body
[23:42:42] <Cork> wrapped by the dialog widget
[23:42:54] <jop008> I have a regexp for date format check http://jsfiddle.net/ARuxp/116/ not expected result
[23:43:05] <guzzlefry> oh
[23:43:47] <guzzlefry> Cork: So I guess a data-categoryid attribute should be used instead of the sibling selector?
[23:43:54] <jop008> string[4] is a kind of substring function?
[23:44:47] <Cork> jop008: if(('yyyy-mmd-dd')[4] == '-') {}
[23:45:30] <Cork> guzzlefry: well data- is not the best option here as that would mean an attribute selector
[23:45:37] <Cork> a class or id would be better
[23:45:46] <Cork> or just save the reference to the element you want
[23:46:29] <guzzlefry> What's wrong with an attitribute selector? Performance?
[23:46:34] <Cork> yes
[23:46:59] <Cork> ex. $('[data-categoryid]') does a find for all elements in the page
[23:47:22] <Cork> and then loops over each element checking if they have an attribute 'data-categoryid'
[23:47:28] <Cork> while #id or .class
[23:47:38] <Cork> has a hash in the browser
[23:47:47] <Cork> and it can just look it up in that table
[23:48:35] <Cork> sure it does it in c code, so it is fairly fast
[23:49:00] <Cork> but it is A LOT more work and it has big effects if the page has many dom elements
