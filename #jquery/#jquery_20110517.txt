[00:05:22] <Gurpartap> coldhead: why?
[00:05:22] <bot-t> (26 mins 50 secs ago) <coldhead> tell Gurpartap can you prevent Lampoon's logs being indexed in search engines?
[00:07:37] <dkannan> does the datepicker support a form and to date
[00:08:48] <beepbeep_> Hey all, what is the best way to deted overflow and add "..." ?
[00:09:58] <coldhead> beepbeep_: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/ellipsis
[00:10:14] <safzouf> Hi there
[00:10:20] <coldhead> dkannan: i believe it does but check the docs
[00:10:29] <safzouf> How to make 2 effects simultanous?
[00:10:56] <coldhead> Gurpartap: because there's no good reason to keep them indexable
[00:11:05] <Gurpartap> what else
[00:11:07] <Gurpartap> :p
[00:11:24] <coldhead> Gurpartap: and some people are worried about things said in jest or by accident being googlable forever
[00:11:33] <coldhead> like no one would ever hire coldhead
[00:11:39] <Gurpartap> cme on
[00:11:39] <Gurpartap> :p
[00:11:41] <mickael_> Hi All, i need some help to explain me the jquery UI autocomplete
[00:12:05] <coldhead> also freenode's policy is that you shouldn't keep logs in public
[00:12:16] <coldhead> whhy SHOULD it be in google?
[00:12:53] <safzouf> so, any way to make 2 effects on a nelement on same time?
[00:12:59] <safzouf> an element
[00:13:28] <mickael_> safzouf, use addqueue
[00:13:35] <safzouf> emm
[00:13:37] <safzouf> okay
[00:13:40] <coldhead> $('p').animate({width:'200px', height:'200px'})
[00:13:59] <coldhead> ?animate @ safzouf
[00:14:00] <bot-t> safzouf, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[00:14:18] <safzouf> okay thanks guys ;)
[00:15:11] <dkannan> coldhead: not finding any option for multiple datepickers
[00:16:53] <mickael_> coldhead : can you help me to use autocomplete ? i have a bug, when i blur input to click on a submit button, the submit is call before the change event of autocmplete
[00:17:25] <dkannan> coldhead: ok got it at http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#date-range
[00:17:56] <coldhead> mickael_: i have never used autocomplete sorry but if you can get a working demo up at jsfiddle we can take a look
[00:17:58] <coldhead> ?p
[00:17:59] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[00:18:47] <mickael_> coldhead : oki
[00:21:04] <coldhead> Gurpartap: what do you think?
[00:21:37] <Gurpartap> coldhead: im not so worried about that.
[00:22:02] <Gurpartap> there's someone in every channel who doesnt want to see himself on logs.
[00:22:03] <Gurpartap> publicly
[00:22:24] <coldhead> that doesn't mean that everyone else DOES want to be seen in the logs
[00:22:36] <coldhead> i am happy to have the logs, just not googleable
[00:22:42] <Gurpartap> this channel is not invite only :)
[00:23:02] <Gurpartap> googling would help anyone looking for a fix
[00:23:22] <coldhead> no one has ever found a fix by finding an IRC log in google
[00:23:38] <Gurpartap> we can do concealed logs though, if there's really a strong urge some day.
[00:23:44] <Gurpartap> coldhead: bingo
[00:25:34] <coldhead> Gurpartap: i think there are more people are who upset to find the silly things they wrote here are indexed by google  than there are people who are happy to find the silly things they wrote here are indexed by google
[00:26:20] <Gurpartap> http://irclogs.ls-themes.org/freenode/jquery/
[00:26:59] <coldhead> their logs are not as good :)
[00:27:23] <coldhead> i am simply saying that noindex would do more good than harm
[00:27:30] <coldhead> and if you feel differently i will shutup
[00:28:15] <coldhead> AND CURSE YOU AND ALL YOUR CHILDREN
[00:28:18] <Gurpartap> lol
[00:28:19] <coldhead> just kidding
[00:28:23] <Gurpartap> i know
[00:28:23] <Gurpartap> :p
[00:28:39] <coldhead> but it's good if people can let their hair down and not worry that their employers will find their logs
[00:28:40] <Gurpartap> coldhead: next time im updating it.
[00:28:46] <Gurpartap> hah
[00:28:54] <jomofcw> Hello =)
[00:29:01] <coldhead> thank you Gurpartap
[00:29:08] <Gurpartap> thank you coldhead
[00:29:10] <Gurpartap> :)

[00:29:49] <Trisox> coldie suppiee dudie
[00:32:23] <coldhead> hey Trisox! i'm playing super mario
[00:33:14] <Trisox> nice
[00:33:20] <Trisox> not anry birds on chrome?
[00:33:35] <coldhead> i haven't tried that yet
[00:33:42] <coldhead> or ro.me
[00:39:01] <juha___> howdy folks
[00:42:02] <noregret> can anyone take a look at this please, http://pastie.org/1913581
[01:00:54] <danslo> noregret: well, first off... you should be using serializeArray instead of manually building a json string
[01:01:58] <danslo> in regards to your error, you should not be using {data}, those parentheses should be part of the string
[01:03:28] <makuchaku> Hi, a weird scenario => if I somehow have jQuery initialized in two scopes - $ & $j - and I trigger an event in $j scope => $j("body").trigger("eventName") , would I be able to catch the event in $ scope => $("body").bind("eventName", eventFunc)
[01:04:21] <MaxMeents> would running my script on a via node.js make it possible to keep my javascript private?
[01:04:50] <MagePsycho> hi guys..
[01:04:57] <MaxMeents> yellow
[01:05:04] <MagePsycho> can you list the top 5 jquery lightbox extension
[01:06:29] <alejandrofernand> hello :) is it possible to turn a jquery datepicker into a month/year picker?
[01:06:48] <noregret> danslo: i can't use serializeArray because of this issue http://pastebin.com/wqeYyAdX do you have another solution?
[01:07:55] <razamatan> newb question, details at: http://pastebin.com/KhLzytcF, tl;dr: need to see if i can make a conditional test more succinct
[01:15:29] <alex87> no matter what selector i use .length returns 0: $('#header').length; for example. any ideas?
[01:16:56] <Zerxer> alex87 are you sure they exist
[01:17:00] <Zerxer> and $ is actually jquery
[01:17:15] <j-okta> does .size() give the same?
[01:17:36] <alex87> Zerxer: j-okta: i think it may be because it wasn't under ready()... sorry!
[01:20:54] <dkannan> any plugin to parse a url
[01:21:09] <dkannan> file:///Users/deepak/Downloads/jquery.url/readme.html does not work for the stable version
[01:22:46] <sac> are you sure you need file:/// urls? :o
[01:23:06] <Cork> dkannan: at least gecko will block that url
[01:23:12] <AdvoWork> if im doing: <div class="ui-datetime-calendar-'+className+'"><button class="ui-datepicker-close ui-state-default ui-priority-primary ui-corner-all" onclick="$(this).hide();"   what would (this) be representing? the button? or the div?
[01:23:17] <shomon> hi, can you make a datepicker give only months and years?
[01:23:19] <Cork> i think chrome is restrictive too
[01:23:55] <nine2five1> hi
[01:24:28] <AdvoWork> shomon, you def can.. i saw something that did it yesterday but cant rememeber where
[01:24:43] <nine2five1> Can I have a question ? Suddenly something has stopped working in my code.
[01:24:46] <shomon> :) well at least there's hope!
[01:24:48] <shomon> :)
[01:24:52] <noregret> does anyone havd a solution for http://pastebin.com/wqeYyAdX ?
[01:25:07] <nine2five1> And I have no idea what's going on exactly.
[01:26:17] <nine2five1> Is it possible, to assign some jQuery object to an element of some class ?
[01:26:26] <Cork> noregret: you need to use .checked() instead
[01:26:49] <Cork> noregret: as unchecked checkboxes/options serialize to nothing
[01:27:38] <noregret> didn't know checked() event existed...
[01:27:48] <sac> nine2five1, obj.add('.someclass');
[01:27:54] <sac> if i understand your question correctly
[01:27:57] <Cork> noregret: i didn't mean the event
[01:28:03] <nine2five1> sac: I meant something like that
[01:28:15] <nine2five1> $(".class").each(function() {
[01:28:19] <Cork> noregret: instead of serialize() you need to see if the checkbox is checked
[01:28:25] <AdvoWork> shomon, i found it by searching for datepicker with times, but unsure which page, sorry
[01:28:59] <dodfr> hi
[01:29:32] <dodfr> I finally solved my cookie problem (saving ok chrome/ff/opera, nok IE
[01:30:04] <noregret> Cork: i don't get it... so the checkbox shouldn't be serialized  and sent ?
[01:30:29] <Cork> noregret: no as i said before, an unchecked checkbox serialize to nothing
[01:30:38] <Cork> by form design
[01:31:23] <dodfr> nok IE and nok Safari
[01:31:46] <makuchaku> Can events fired by jQuery in $ scope be tracked by jquery in scope $j - both running on same page?
[01:31:57] <noregret> Cork: so you're saying i should do something like this, http://pastie.org/1913581 ?
[01:32:12] <juha___> this dr. pepper isn't as close as good as my coffee yesterday :/
[01:32:23] <Cork> noregret: no
[01:32:27] <Peeter> hi
[01:32:40] <dodfr> it seems that encodeURIComponent produce in some cases a string that can be saved into a cookie (cookie stored into browser's file:databse) but this cookie cannot be retrieved and do not appear in document.cookie
[01:33:12] <Peeter> I've got a question about disabeling new input on textareas. I'd like my user to continue to be able to delete text off a textarea, but not allow new content to be added after a certain limit has been achieved.
[01:33:14] <dodfr> basically I used the jquery cookie plugin that do encodeURIComponent before saving string to cookie
[01:33:46] <Peeter> I'm currently simply preventDefaulting on keydown, but is there a better way?
[01:34:27] <noregret> Cork: so constructing my own json isn't right, even though what i have will be sent, checked or unchecked..... i still don't get it :)
[01:34:36] <dodfr> once I modified encodeURIComponent to encodeURI then cookie it saved and read correctly on all browsers, anyone have seen this ? I kept the string that produce the problem.
[01:35:29] <Cork> noregret: this should get you want you want in a farly clean fason http://jsfiddle.net/zxPq3/
[01:36:37] <noregret> Cork; ah, that's what i was trying to do.. except some json errors... i thought it was a different idea..
[01:37:03] <Cork> noregret: you created a string, instead of letting jquery do the conversion
[01:37:12] <Cork> and that messy and error phrown
[01:37:47] <rfx_> Is there a way to download all themes from jqueryui ? I only find a way to select them individually and download one by one?
[01:37:51] <noregret> Cork: yeah, thanks :)
[01:38:04] <Cork> noregret: a warning though set might be a reserved word in some browsers
[01:38:15] <Cork> so make sure you test that
[01:38:17] <noregret> alrighty
[01:39:41] <dr0id> supybot
[01:44:31] <beepbeep_> Hey all, I've got a div (fixed height) with links in it, what's the best way to check whether or not there are too many links in the div
[01:45:01] <quicksilver> coldhead: FWIW I have quite often found good answers by googling up IRC logs (not for jquery specifically though)
[01:45:34] <coldhead> good answers should be in better places than IRC logs
[01:45:42] <coldhead> IRC logs are more ghetto than myspace
[01:46:11] <coldhead> if someone wants answers they should come get it from IRC, not stale old uninformed crap
[01:46:50] <coldhead> anyway freenode says you have to tell people when a channel is being publicly logged and it's much easier not to log at all :)
[01:47:47] <quicksilver> sure.
[01:47:50] <misterm> for some reason I just imagined confused coders tracking down the freenode servers and wrassling them for answers
[01:52:56] <nine2five1> I have a little conflict between my script and lightbox
[01:53:00] <nine2five1> can anybody help me ?
[01:53:58] <nine2five1> http://pastebin.com/3aVkgJtC we have something like that.
[01:54:44] <nine2five1> and for each button i do something like that: $("button").each(function() {
[01:58:46] <bhavesh> I want to get position of a <div> which is actually a text as coordinates of an background image.. Background Image is "pointer_div" and text div is "bv_Text1"
[01:58:58] <bhavesh> and this is what I did
[01:58:59] <bhavesh> pos_x = document.getElementById("bv_Text1").style.Left-document.getElementById("pointer_div").offsetLeft;
[01:59:10] <bhavesh> but I get result NaN
[01:59:26] <bhavesh> whats wrong in there?
[02:00:30] <dodfr> bhavesh : may be one of object is not existing
[02:00:51] <MagePsycho> can you list the top 5 jquery lightbox extension
[02:00:54] <bhavesh> erm.. I checked but both are present
[02:01:51] <dodfr> bhavesh : if NaN then one of element in your path is not existing
[02:02:26] <dodfr> try to cut some and see if each sub object return something
[02:02:32] <beepbeep_> How do I select the 10th element for example? I'd google it but I don't know what kind of selector I'm looking for
[02:02:53] <bhavesh> dodfr: ok
[02:03:07] <dodfr> beepbeep_: :nth(n)
[02:03:24] <MaxMeents> is there anyway to insert this .html('<div />') 20x without having to break the chain?
[02:03:41] <beepbeep_> dodfr: thx
[02:04:34] <nine2five1> Has anybody ever had a problem with lightbox ? When I enable it then my jquery script is excluded and does not work
[02:05:03] <nine2five1> and then only lightbox works, ofc
[02:05:19] <beepbeep_> dodfr: is there an easy way to select like .. the 10th element and up, for example?
[02:07:27] <MagePsycho> can anybody list the top 5 jquery lightbox extension
[02:07:46] <MagePsycho> fancybox, pirobox, colorbox .... ?
[02:13:11] <Aamir> ?g jquery facebox
[02:13:13] <bot-t> Aamir, Facebox 1.3 - http://defunkt.io/facebox/
[02:13:51] <Aamir> beepbeep_:  $('li:eq(10)').prevAll('li') ?
[02:14:47] <nine2five1> Does anybody know why Lightbox can exclude my script ?
[02:14:49] <beepbeep_> thx Aamir, found that already but thx :D
[02:17:16] <MCBONG> hi there
[02:17:58] <MagePsycho> facebox seems very simple
[02:18:03] <MagePsycho> what about shadow box
[02:18:08] <MagePsycho> prettyPhoto?
[02:19:56] <MCBONG> I've a problem with oading images asynchronously. This works fine but it gives random results. Can anyone maybe help me for a quick second?
[02:23:10] <MaxMeents> consider there is only one elem in the jquery object but several steps to your chain, is .each the best way to run a function against the currently selected elem or is there something like .fun()
[02:23:31] <MaxMeents> I just need to keep the chain intact so I can use .end()
[02:25:31] <systemes> hi all, not sure if this is the place, but I thought I might try
[02:26:02] <systemes> does anyone know if it is possible to make a google map with icons that get updated in real time from mysql updates?
[02:26:47] <systemes> For example, I am running an activity for some scouts which requires them to scan QR codes around the city; when the script I've written detects one of them has scanned a QR code, I want to have its icon on a google map flash with the information of the team that scanned it
[02:28:01] <beepbeep_> it's not possible to insert a "<span>" tag at a certain place and inster the closing "</span>" tag somewhere else?
[02:28:09] <beepbeep_> friggin jQuery automaticly adds the closing tag
[02:28:55] <quicksilver> beepbeep_: use wrap, perhaps?
[02:30:22] <beepbeep_> doesn't do the trick
[02:30:24] <beepbeep_> I really need to say
[02:30:29] <beepbeep_> it starts here and ends therez
[02:31:32] <ifndefx> beepbeep_: $("<span> my Details</span").append("<span>Anotherset of details</span>")' ?
[02:32:11] <beepbeep_> okay heres the deal, if you have a minute
[02:32:28] <beepbeep_> php generates a div with <a> elements in it, easy frigging game
[02:32:37] <coldhead> jquery is not trying to piss you off, it ensures that HTML is valid vecause browsers spazz out differently if you have unclosed tags
[02:32:38] <beepbeep_> it puts comma's between those <a> elements
[02:32:44] <nine2five1> yyy
[02:32:50] <nine2five1> how its possible ?
[02:32:52] <bhavesh_> I am trying to find position of a <div> relative to another <div>  OR in other words X and Y of above <div> "minus" X and Y of background <div>
[02:33:14] <nine2five1> beepbeep_ : you use echo or sth ?
[02:33:42] <Cork> beepbeep_: thats cause the dom can't do what you want to do, your talking html
[02:33:53] <quicksilver> bhavesh_: http://api.jquery.com/position/ http://api.jquery.com/offset
[02:33:54] <bhavesh_> I found .position() http://api.jquery.com/position/ but I couldnt understand var p = $("p:first"); what is first in there?
[02:34:04] <beepbeep_> the problem is
[02:34:07] <beepbeep_> I have my a elements right
[02:34:19] <beepbeep_> $('.item a:nth-child(10)').nextAll()
[02:34:23] <quicksilver> bhavesh_: http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[02:34:25] <beepbeep_> this selects my a elements
[02:34:29] <beepbeep_> not the comma's between them
[02:34:37] <beepbeep_> I need my comma's inside that span
[02:35:06] <Cork> beepbeep_: thats cause your selecting the a elements, not the html
[02:35:16] <Cork> the commas isn't a elements
[02:35:21] <beepbeep_> yes, I get thar
[02:35:28] <beepbeep_> I figured that was the problem :P
[02:35:29] <Cork> and its not an element at all actually
[02:35:31] <beepbeep_> so how do I select it
[02:35:41] <Cork> you can't as its not an element
[02:35:43] <beepbeep_> I just want my span to start after the 10th and end after the last
[02:35:44] <bhavesh_> quicksilver: it applies jquery settings to first match like if there are many <p>'s it applies to first occurence?
[02:35:56] <Cork> beepbeep_: you would have to select the parent and render the dom to html
[02:36:14] <Cork> $('.item').html()
[02:36:24] <quicksilver> bhavesh_: yes.
[02:36:27] <ifndefx> I would get the html and string manipulation
[02:36:36] <quicksilver> beepbeep_: jQuery is a bit weak with text elements.
[02:36:38] <ifndefx> what cork said...
[02:36:47] <beepbeep_> aight so I get the html, fix my string
[02:36:50] <beepbeep_> and that's that?
[02:36:56] <beepbeep_> let's try :)
[02:37:11] <coldhead> html is a bit weak with text elements
[02:37:17] <Cork> ya
[02:37:26] <Cork> text elements almost doesn't exist even
[02:37:29] <quicksilver> you can use .contents() to get all elements including text nodes
[02:37:37] <quicksilver> but what you want is still a bit fiddly.
[02:37:51] <ifndefx> or text()
[02:38:11] <Cork> text would remove the a links though :)
[02:38:18] <guy> anyone here owns blog about IT/magazine?
[02:38:34] <ifndefx> yes true
[02:38:52] <MCBONG> I'm loading images asynchronously into an html document. I use hidden fields in the document that hold the source locations of the images. By looping trough them the images are being loaded, but not as expected. I'd expect them to always be in the  order of 18, 19, 20, 21 but instead of that images get loaded, well for as far as I can see, pretty randomly... How can this be and is there a solution? All help appreciated :)
[02:39:33] <Cork> MCBONG: network calls is by design async
[02:39:51] <Cork> MCBONG: you would have to wait for the previus call to finish if you want them syncronus
[02:40:10] <Cork> MCBONG: else the transfer that takes the shortest time will finnish first
[02:40:23] <Cork> and thats not only file size
[02:40:26] <guy> I have an article to submit. Disabled Facebook Accounts Snowball if anyone interested in putting that on their blog/magazine, let me know in PM.
[02:40:47] <Cork> guy: i think your in the wrong channel for that
[02:41:01] <Cork> this is jquery not facebook news
[02:41:17] <Cork> keep it on topic please
[02:41:30] <MCBONG> Thanks Cork. But why would give that a random result? If I understand you correctly it should always use the smallest picture right?
[02:41:54] <Cork> MCBONG: no as the traveling time on the net isn't constant
[02:42:15] <Cork> MCBONG: each package can take different amount of time to reach its destination
[02:42:36] <Cork> the server can hold on sending files after x simultanius requests
[02:42:41] <Cork> the browser throttles thinkgs
[02:42:43] <Cork> and so on
[02:42:46] <Cork> its many factors
[02:43:30] <MCBONG> Aaaah thanks, this is very helpful. Any idea how I should solve this problem?
[02:43:53] <Cork> ?.load @ MCBONG
[02:43:53] <bot-t> MCBONG, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[02:44:50] <Cork> you should prob bind error too, so that loading doesn't stop if an image is missing
[02:45:17] <MCBONG> If fixed that Cork
[02:45:42] <MCBONG> ehh I mean I fixed the bind error
[02:45:55] <Cork> no i meant bind('error') :)
[02:46:01] <sean`> ment
[02:46:19] <Cork> it triggers if the downloading of the image results in a network error, or parsing error
[02:46:54] <Cork> load only triggers if the loading of the image was successfull
[02:47:02] <coldhead> that's quality advice, Cork
[02:47:04] <coldhead> good job
[02:47:16] <Cork> thx :)
[02:48:10] <timing> Hi!
[02:48:19] <bhavesh_> quicksilver: in .position() example at http://api.jquery.com/position/ it says var position = p.position(); how is it relative to another <div>?
[02:48:31] <timing> Why does jquery catch all my errors and throws is again?
[02:48:39] <bhavesh_> quicksilver: because its inside it?
[02:48:45] <timing> i'm unable to debug it because the errors are always thrown at the same place
[02:49:09] <timing> and my chrome debugger 'don't pause on exceptions doesn't work then'
[02:49:10] <Cork> timing: whats the type of code?
[02:49:33] <Cork> timing: debugging works fine here
[02:49:47] <bhavesh_> How can I link .position() to a <div> which is outside...?
[02:50:13] <Cork> timing: i know a few situations where errors can come from other parts, but that mostly cause that code crash cause it get the wrong input
[02:50:24] <timing> Cork: I don't know the code yet. but the error is Cannot read property top of null
[02:50:31] <timing> probably an offset.top thing I use somewhere
[02:50:33] <timing> no idea where yet
[02:50:48] <quicksilver> bhavesh_: the docs say "The .position() method allows us to retrieve the current position of an element relative to the offset parent"
[02:50:49] <Cork> timing: could be a loop or something
[02:50:55] <quicksilver> bhavesh_: and, that is what it does as far as I know.
[02:51:11] <Cork> its quite common to happen if jquery gets an object it doesn't expect
[02:51:18] <bhavesh_> quicksilver: so if my <div> is outside I cannot link it...?
[02:51:56] <quicksilver> bhavesh_: no. You just need to learn about how web browsers work.
[02:51:58] <Cork> timing: but its not that jquery re throws the error, its that its internal code crash, not your code
[02:51:59] <AlexC_> g'morning
[02:52:05] <timing> Cork: the code is like: var offset = $('#element').offset(); $('#otherElement').css('top', offset.top);
[02:52:11] <quicksilver> bhavesh_: I also pointed you to 'offset' which gives the position in a different coordinate system.
[02:52:15] <AlexC_> with 1.6.1, if I am wanting to update the 'name' attribute, should I still be using attr() or prop()?
[02:52:27] <quicksilver> bhavesh_: you may need to google what an 'offset parent' is. You may need to do some maths.
[02:52:54] <bhavesh_> quicksilver: .offset() gives coordinates to document.. so I could do offset() for above <div> minus offset of back <div> :)
[02:53:10] <Cork> timing: verify that offset.top is a correct value then
[02:53:15] <bhavesh_> that would give me coordinates relative to my back <div>
[02:53:22] <quicksilver> bhavesh_: yes. That kind of thing.
[02:53:28] <timing> jquery-1.5.1.js:869 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null
[02:53:40] <timing> Cork: I know how to solve the issue, but that's not the point
[02:54:01] <timing> the useless error is the point
[02:54:10] <Cork> timing: i know what the point is, but i try to find the code that crash
[02:54:12] <timing> With firebug I can debug this correctly btw
[02:54:15] <timing> but I dev in chrome
[02:54:18] <Cork> that makes it farly simple to tell why
[02:54:29] <timing> Cork: ok, sorry.
[02:55:13] <Cork> wtf...
[02:55:27] <Cork> timing: that code whouldn't cause you any harm
[02:55:41] <Cork> oh wait i read wrong
[02:55:51] <MCBONG> Thanks Cork, this was very helpful and I can build further from here!
[02:56:10] <Cork> np
[02:56:44] <Cork> timing: hmm its the defered code that crashes on the null object
[02:57:05] <Cork> (new functionality in 1.5)
[02:58:17] <timing> Cork: ok, but in firefox it crashes earlier ( in my code ). In chrome it crashes in jqueries code
[02:58:49] <Cork> timing: well come to the world of different engins ;)
[02:59:05] <SilentPenguin> javascript engines can die
[02:59:10] <Cork> lol
[02:59:16] <Cork> your in the wrong channel then XD
[02:59:39] <SilentPenguin> it's always IE that doesn't do what it should, and then doesn't throw an error
[03:00:16] <Cork> SilentPenguin: the biggest problem with ie, is that even when it knows something went wrong, it doesn't know where XD
[03:00:38] <SilentPenguin> i've been having issues where appending html in IE takes about half a minute, as apposed to about a 1/4th of a second in everything else
[03:00:43] <Cork> but with the new jit js engins all browsers have funny behaviors from time to time
[03:01:26] <SilentPenguin> Cork: IE knows only two errors "unexpected error" and "syntax error" even the new debugger in IE is hateful
[03:01:53] <Cork> haven't actually coded much in ie9 so wouldn't know, i only test there
[03:02:03] <Cork> and it have treated me farly this far
[03:02:27] <SilentPenguin> when things inevitably break in IE, you'll know my pain ;D
[03:02:36] <Cork> i do
[03:02:53] <Cork> what i meant is ie9 is actually quite painless
[03:03:14] <Cork> ite ie8 and ie7 and not to forget the all time hated ie6 thats the problem
[03:03:17] <Cork> *its
[03:03:27] <SilentPenguin> i've not got to IE9 yet
[03:03:35] <Cork> ah :)
[03:03:55] <SilentPenguin> oh, yes i have, i'm in the beta version apparently
[03:04:10] <SilentPenguin> least, i am now, i don't remember bothering to install it
[03:04:12] <Cork> i run it on a vm here >_>
[03:04:23] <Cork> its still slow but its a heck a lot faster then ie8
[03:06:41] <SilentPenguin> yeah, IE9 is dismally slow still
[03:07:35] <SilentPenguin> it's no small wonder why they continue to develop it, you would think they would have struck a deal with someone like mozilla by now
[03:08:02] <sean`> webkitrz
[03:08:04] <SilentPenguin> the only users of IE now are people who can't install anything else or simply wouldn't care either way

[03:15:57] <DarsVaeda> hi, how can I merge a jquery object with json before serializing it?
[03:16:21] <DarsVaeda> I wand to get all $(:input) and then append some additional options to it
[03:16:48] <DarsVaeda> I can manipulate the string, but that's not..."cool" :D
[03:20:13] <Mafia> hi
[03:23:39] <BlaDe^> with html5 drag/drop can i populate an <input type="file" /> ?
[03:25:22] <rethus> i have a string like this:
[03:25:22] <rethus> " 1                    1                    0                    00:26:45". How can i create eayly an array out of this "with whitespace splitted" values?
[03:27:41] <lkeijser> hi, i have a minor issue with adding/removing classes. I use it to highlight menu items: on mouseover a class gets added which highlights the item, when you move away the class gets removed
[03:27:56] <safzouf> Hi there
[03:27:58] <lkeijser> but when i click on an item, move the mouse and press the Back button, the item stays highlighted
[03:28:17] <lkeijser> i've set up a small demo:  http://gotlinux.nl:888/index.html
[03:28:18] <safzouf> how st set background image to an element
[03:28:30] <safzouf> with some details
[03:28:41] <lkeijser> if anyone could take a look and tell me what i could do to make it work, i'd appreciate it
[03:28:48] <safzouf> example: url('../img/block_footer.png') no-repeat bottom left
[03:28:59] <safzouf> how to put this in jquery?
[03:30:22] <lkeijser> i've also made a jsfiddle site: http://jsfiddle.net/nnQJE/3/  but that's not a very good demo since i can't make the menu items leave the jsfiddle site :)
[03:37:26] <alessio_alex> hello
[03:37:31] <alessio_alex> So now in jQuery 1.6+
[03:37:36] <alessio_alex> I should use prop instead of attr right?
[03:37:46] <sean`> depends
[03:37:50] <alessio_alex> on what?
[03:37:57] <sean`> have you read the blogposts?
[03:38:02] <sean`> It describes what is prefered
[03:38:06] <alessio_alex> I have read something
[03:38:09] <alessio_alex> But I'm just confused
[03:38:24] <alessio_alex> attr returns undefined for some things
[03:38:26] <alessio_alex> properties
[03:38:28] <sean`> there's a table, with attributes markgin what to use
[03:38:45] <alessio_alex> whilist prop returns true of false for properties
[03:38:46] <alessio_alex> no?
[03:39:00] <rethus>  " 1                    1                    0                    00:26:45". How can i create eayly an array out of this "with whitespace splitted" values?
[03:39:00] <alessio_alex> attr calls prop internally for stuff such as id, title, etc ?
[03:39:09] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/caAEH/2/
[03:40:03] <lkeijser> i had the idea of using removeClass on all items before using addClass , but i don't know how to select all items
[03:40:50] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/caAEH/4/
[03:41:46] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/caAEH/5/
[03:41:57] <rethus> near, but not the solution
[03:42:35] <rethus> how can i remove a undefined count of whitespasces, and keep each value in a var?
[03:44:24] <seutje> rethus: regex?
[03:46:20] <mello> hi, i'm using jquery mobile and i have navigation (previous and next), how can i do a normal post to a certain url without using forms?
[03:46:34] <seutje> lkeijser: I'm assuming ur using FF, since that's the only browser that behaves like that
[03:47:33] <mello> right now it is wrapped in two forms, but the lay out doesn't work like i want it because of that. a link should be enough, but causes problems for some reason
[03:47:35] <seutje> lkeijser: only thing u can do about that is explicitly remove them on doc rdy or something, me thinks
[03:49:08] <lkeijser> seutje: yes i'm using firefox ...  and i've _just_ fixed it by doing a removeClass() on all items with the class, right before adding it to a new item
[03:49:40] <lkeijser> thanks though for the tip, i will definitely test my site with more than one browser from now on
[03:49:55] <seutje> lkeijser: if u used css instead, u wouldn't have this problem, just saying ;)
[03:50:44] <lkeijser> seutje: i can highlight items just with css?   i'm so new to web dev. pardon my ignorance
[03:51:21] <seutje> lkeijser: http://jsfiddle.net/nnQJE/5
[03:51:48] <lkeijser> lol, well that's easy :)
[03:51:58] <lkeijser> thanks!
[03:53:43] <eml> $("#mydiv").css('border-left-width') returns "3px". Is there an easier way to get a value of "3" (without "px") than simply splitting this using string functions?
[03:54:11] <seutje> firefox retains the focussed state
[03:54:11] <seutje> lkeijser: so this should present the same problem u had http://jsfiddle.net/nnQJE/6/show
[03:54:11] <seutje> note the difference between ":hover" and ":hover, :focus"
[03:57:55] <lkeijser> ah, i see

[05:11:00] <Run\Stop_> Hmm it looks like jQuery 1.6.1 messed up attr() with namespacing in Opera :(
[05:11:11] <Run\Stop_> I posted about it in the jQuery forums but its awaiting moderation
[05:21:24] <le_gars> hey could someone maybe help me with a problem I'm having??
[05:23:30] <Trisox> Run\Stop_
[05:23:35] <Trisox> ?.prop
[05:23:46] <mickael_> le_gars : ton problème ?
[05:23:47] <Trisox> bot doesnt know it?
[05:24:02] <Vrooom> Hi  this jquery case switch is driving me mad,  it seem it can do 6 pages that it?
[05:24:02] <Trisox> attr = / could be prop
[05:24:45] <le_gars> This is the url to the problem I'm having...http://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-dynamic-counter
[05:25:19] <le_gars> i just want to update the span with the json data so that it functions as a counter
[05:27:12] <Run\Stop_> Trisox: I tried the new prop() as well, it gives me undefined, though I havent tried all permutations of prop() for namespacing. And by that I mean .prop(namespace\\:attributeName) or .prop([nodeName="namespace:attributeName"])
[05:27:19] <Run\Stop_> Going to do that now and see if it works
[05:29:51] <le_gars> so did anyone see my link and had any feedback on my problem
[05:31:51] <Trisox> mm
[05:31:55] <Trisox> strange
[05:32:16] <diegoviola> html is not defined
[05:32:17] <diegoviola> [Break On This Error] $(html).find(".program").appendTo("body")
[05:32:17] <diegoviola> progra...5635317 (line 9)
[05:32:22] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[05:32:39] <quicksilver> diegoviola: html is a variable name. Presumably it is not defined.
[05:32:50] <quicksilver> presumabely you meant $('html').find('.program)....
[05:32:54] <iivvoo> perhaps you want $("html")?
[05:32:58] <diegoviola> yes, sorry, thanks
[05:33:02] <quicksilver> although why not just $('.program') ?
[05:33:20] <diegoviola> right, that also works, thanks
[05:33:56] <ahtinurme> i ran into a strange autocomplete with IE bug today: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-autocomplete-problems-on-ie-6-and-ie-7
[05:34:25] <DarsVaeda> hey, I try to change the color of the jquery ui effect highligh ".effect("highlight", {"color":"ff0000"}, 3000);" but this seems not to be working in jquery ui 1.8.2 ?
[05:35:09] <ahtinurme> but i'm not that into doing a custom version of jQuery, so any ideas how to tackle it? works fine on IE9, but IE8 or less is a problem
[05:36:12] <le_coeur> maybe "color" : "#ff0000"
[05:37:20] <Run\Stop_> Trisox: Looks as though prop() also didn't do the trick
[05:38:06] <MatthiasVance> I don't suppose there's a string formatting function in jquery, is there? (I could not find one)
[05:38:25] <DarsVaeda> le_coeur: yep it was that easy ^^
[05:38:48] <Run\Stop_> MatthiasVance: to do what
[05:39:03] <diegoviola> .find(".foo") gets the element by class or id?
[05:39:13] <Run\Stop_> class
[05:39:19] <diegoviola> thanks
[05:39:26] <Run\Stop_> # = id
[05:39:34] <diegoviola> thanks
[05:39:37] <Run\Stop_> yup
[05:41:13] <ChristianAdamski> hey, I have:  <li>A, B</li> and I want to split by the comma to get <li>A</li><li>B</li>
[05:41:38] <ChristianAdamski> All I can think of, is very complicated stuff, is there a fast / simple way to do that?
[05:42:06] <Vrooom> this stupid bug is driving me crazy, can anyone have a look why it happening ?      the page loads "teams"  page at the bottom of "welcome" page when its first loaded.   I think its do with Jquery's limitation.     can anyone have a look ?
[05:43:11] <Vrooom> http://www.vrooom.copperstream.co.uk/test3/  <<<   this stupid bug is driving me crazy, can anyone have a look why it happening ?      the page loads "teams"  page at the bottom of "welcome" page when its first loaded.

[05:43:25] <Sazpaimon> is it just me or does getscript not work in chrome?
[05:43:49] <Run\Stop_> ChristianAdamski: $('li').html().split(',') ?
[05:43:57] <Run\Stop_> wait, would it be html() or text()
[05:44:01] <Run\Stop_> one of the two
[05:44:23] <le_coeur> ChristianAdamski  replace(",","</li><li>")
[05:44:28] <MatthiasVance> Run\Stop_: Ehm, to format a string, as I said! :)
[05:44:34] <ChristianAdamski> thx alot :)
[05:45:22] <Run\Stop_> MatthiasVance: there are a number of ways to format a string. can you give an example of what youd like?
[05:45:52] <MatthiasVance> I'm sorry. I mean something like sprintf().
[05:46:53] <MatthiasVance> var s = format("%d", integer)
[05:46:54] <Vrooom> anyone?
[05:48:01] <MatthiasVance> Actually, Run\Stop_, I'll just write my own that takes a string, finds every occurence of <specialchar>, and replaces it with the next argument.
[05:48:33] <Run\Stop_> MatthiasVance: I would think a simple replace function would handle that, no?
[05:48:48] <Ely^> http://jsfiddle.net/nF7fU/5/ Hi, i have a problem that my previous image src is not put back when doing mouseleave
[05:49:07] <MatthiasVance> Run\Stop_: A replace function that takes multiple arguments and places them in order would definitely do.
[05:51:10] <Fox`> can anyone work out why this simple keydown event is triggering send() to be executed twice? http://pastebin.com/FdAsk1rG
[05:51:45] <iivvoo> Vrooom, I have no idea what the page is supposed to do (it's acutally offering me a binary download)
[05:51:56] <iivvoo> Vrooom, try producing a boiled down case on jsfiddle
[05:53:03] <Vrooom> this is pain in the ass

[05:53:41] <Run\Stop_> le_coeur: I like your replace solution to ChristianAdamski's problem.
[05:54:14] <MatthiasVance> quicksilver: That's not what I'm looking for. I'll just write a nice function to do this for me!
[05:54:16] <Fox`> fun site ^
[05:55:08] <MatthiasVance> Vrooom: When I access that page, your index.php file starts to download. "Single File PHP Gallery 4.1.0 (SFPG)"
[05:55:12] <MatthiasVance> Not sure if that's intended.
[05:55:32] <iivvoo> MatthiasVance, that was kinda my point, his response is the same url again
[05:55:34] <Anitox> downloadable php files, that cant be good

[05:57:57] <mello> Anitox, yes, in a certain case i want the link to be deleted

[05:58:43] <mello> and it works fine on my pc
[05:59:03] <mello> but in my iphone, it isn't deleted
[05:59:19] <mello> could it be that it cached the js?
[05:59:25] <Anitox> yes
[05:59:29] <Anitox> phones like to cache
[05:59:37] <Fox`> posplaw: you POST with javascript using ajax
[05:59:59] <Vrooom> Sorry, i deleted the php link off.  now you can try again.      http://www.vrooom.copperstream.co.uk/test3/index.html
[06:00:08] <mello> anitox: guess i'll find an emulator then
[06:00:33] <Anitox> lemme try on my iphone. ive been doing mobile work for my company
[06:01:00] <Sazpaimon> Okay, I see
[06:01:16] <Sazpaimon> getScript on chrome isn't sending the document referrer
[06:01:40] <le_gars> could anyone help me with this problem?? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-dynamic-counter
[06:01:59] <le_gars> would be most grateful
[06:02:02] <Fox`> Anyone know why send() is executing twice with this keydown event? http://pastebin.com/FdAsk1rG
[06:02:24] <Sazpaimon> or wait.. it is, but document.referer is undefined
[06:02:32] <Sazpaimon> probably because the script is executed locally
[06:03:15] <posplaw> ah, i will use form.serialize
[06:05:32] <danslo> Fox`: that should work fine.. im guessing you have loaded the same javascript file twice or something :)
[06:06:10] <Fox`> danslo: yeh, except i've got another click() event for the same function and it works fine
[06:07:12] <danslo> they may work differently
[06:10:27] <Aamir> I am using jQuery slideToggle but an image disappears soon the slideDown finishes in IE7 :|  any idea what to try?
[06:11:04] <Babak__> anyone using jq grid?
[06:17:02] <diegoviola> strange, when i access my web site like this: http://localhost:3000/programs/?per_page=10 -- i get the full content (10 pages of programs/products) but when doing an ajax request with that data per_page=10 i don't get it on the callback
[06:17:59] <diegoviola> but i see the ajax request is sending that data as well
[06:18:02] <diegoviola> any ideas?
[06:18:03] <Anitox> are you doing $.get ?
[06:19:53] <diegoviola> Anitox: $.ajax
[06:19:59] <diegoviola> Anitox: like this: https://gist.github.com/976447
[06:20:18] <Anitox> set it as type GET
[06:20:32] <Anitox> and put the params into the URL
[06:20:50] <diegoviola> ok
[06:21:27] <Anitox> $.get('/programs/?per_page='+$('#per_page').val(), function(data) { alert(data); });
[06:22:16] <crimlo> hey
[06:22:27] <crimlo> hey
[06:22:40] <crimlo> hey
[06:22:57] <Anitox> its fat albert!
[06:23:03] <crimlo> yup
[06:23:26] <crimlo> the funny thing is i am fat and black too
[06:23:36] <crimlo> so that was sooo racist
[06:23:59] <Anitox> actually, if i stated it after you notified me, then it would be racist ;)
[06:24:11] <Anitox> otherwise, it's just a joke
[06:24:18] <crimlo> still racist
[06:24:25] <Anitox> but i appreciate your attempt at appearing offended
[06:24:45] <crimlo> keyword (appear)
[06:24:54] <Anitox> indeed
[06:25:11] <crimlo> note: not some lowlife american
[06:25:12] <hermanus> When i drag a ui.draggable, i get a duplicate one which cannot be dropped. anyone know what could be the problem?
[06:25:27] <Anitox> now, are you trying to be racist?
[06:25:40] <crimlo> not possible
[06:25:51] <Sazpaimon> okay, odd. Now my getScript call isn't following my 302 found header
[06:26:07] <crimlo> that backwards thinking was not a part of our lives
[06:26:14] <diegoviola> Anitox: same thing, i'm not getting the same content with http and ajax
[06:26:19] <Sazpaimon> chrome's network analyzer isn't showing the redirect taking place
[06:26:29] <Sazpaimon> anyone know anything about this?
[06:26:36] <crimlo> i do
[06:27:05] <Anitox> someone came out from under the bridge
[06:27:14] <crimlo> yup
[06:27:25] <Anitox> :)
[06:27:37] <crimlo> yet another racist comment ant
[06:27:45] <Anitox> i like races
[06:27:52] <crimlo> so do i
[06:28:10] <Anitox> i dont participate though
[06:28:11] <Anitox> cause im lazy
[06:28:22] <crimlo> which is why i want to run for world leader
[06:28:29] <Anitox> now there's a race
[06:28:37] <Sazpaimon> i guess it isn't jquery talk right now
[06:28:54] <crimlo> the world need reform
[06:28:59] <le_gars> so anyone nkow how to populate a span with data from json object???
[06:28:59] <Anitox> $.takeOverWorld();
[06:29:01] <Anitox> done.
[06:29:01] <crimlo> and i am just the man for that job
[06:29:15] <le_gars> want to make a counter that shows statistics
[06:29:18] <Vrooom> bah
[06:29:45] <hermanus> le_gars, what is the part that you don't get?
[06:31:32] <jeroenem> how can i add a few lines of text to a textarea, by clicking a button?
[06:32:00] <Anitox> $('textarea').text(this.innerHTML+'This is added.');
[06:32:10] <Fox`> argh i tried the hotkeys plugin and i get 4 fires instead o.O
[06:32:25] <Anitox> you may need to specify the correct object in the text() function
[06:32:30] <Anitox> instead of this
[06:32:38] <jeroenem> Anitox, thanks.. was struggling with append()
[06:33:03] <hermanus> le_gars, you can get the object with JSON.parse and, find the property you want and set it with $('#spanname').val(object.property);
[06:33:06] <le_gars> hermanus I'm getting NaN right now in my span
[06:33:15] <diegoviola> any ideas why i would get different content by doing a normal HTTP get and by doing the GET via ajax?
[06:33:18] <diegoviola> this is odd
[06:33:41] <Sazpaimon> can someone please explain to me why $.getScript() isn't follwing my redirect?
[06:33:55] <le_gars> hermanus please see my thread to the problem http://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-dynamic-counter
[06:34:08] <Sazpaimon> I'm doing getScript on a URL that returns a 302 Found to another script, but chrome doesn't load it
[06:34:17] <Sazpaimon> instead, it seems that it loads the same URL
[06:34:22] <hermanus> le_gars, ok, i'll read it
[06:34:28] <le_gars> before I was making progress on the matter but now I've hit the wall
[06:34:41] <le_gars> nice of you hermanus thanks
[06:36:03] <Run\Stop_> So yeah... here's the question I have, posted to jQuery forums: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-1-6-1-opera-and-attr-with-namespacing
[06:37:02] <hermanus> le_gars, do you have a working ajax request right now?
[06:37:35] <le_gars> yes I do
[06:37:51] <le_gars> I have debigged it so I'm recieving the json object without problem
[06:38:07] <le_gars> the problem is displaying it in my span as numbers
[06:38:22] <hermanus> so parseint returns NaN?
[06:38:27] <le_gars> I havent gottent he hang of parsing it correclty
[06:39:47] <CTKArcher> hi
[06:40:20] <le_gars> yes I believe so...
[06:41:05] <le_gars> I guess right no data is the contextuell carrier of my data
[06:41:08] <diegoviola> guys please help, when i'm doing a curl http://0.0.0.0:3000/programs/?per_page=10 I get 10 programs/products listed, but when doing an ajax/get request with that info I only get 1. Any ideas? here is my ajax/get code: https://gist.github.com/976447
[06:41:27] <_ramo> hi
[06:41:37] <hermanus> le_gars, can you paste the returned json object somewhere? maybe the script also? it's a little hard to guess what's going wrong
[06:41:52] <le_gars> like here I'm debugging data and getting out the info so I'm not sure if I should loop out the info or just append it to the span?? http://pastie.org/1916297
[06:42:44] <le_gars> thats the function hermanus in pastie
[06:43:31] <le_gars> and heres the json object http://pastie.org/1916308
[06:43:51] <le_gars> Hope you can keep up hermanus :)
[06:44:16] <le_gars> I might add that I'm new to jquery and javascript so a bit shaky on this.
[06:44:53] <crimlo> WINNING!
[06:45:04] <hermanus> le_gars, yes its a little messy. you're not saving the returned output of the parseInt function.
[06:45:49] <le_gars> So I suspected hmmm how should I go about with this then??
[06:45:59] <Anitox> Winning by being told off!
[06:46:47] <crimlo> wow to even type that here , shows how pathetic you really are
[06:46:59] <crimlo> WINNING!
[06:47:05] <Run\Stop_> flame wars in a javascript irc help channel? come on
[06:47:17] <Anitox> yeah, kinda lame
[06:47:20] <le_gars> Hope you have any feedback, been struggling all day on this thing. I think somewhere along the way I was almost there but must have messed up
[06:47:24] <crimlo> very lame
[06:47:26] <Anitox> he's just running around trying to troll people
[06:47:40] <crimlo> i know you are, but what am i
[06:47:46] <diegoviola> nvm, i'm getting the right response, my mistake... alert() wasn't just giving me the entire html code for some reason
[06:47:57] <Anitox> case in point
[06:48:04] <crimlo> point in case

[06:48:35] <imsky> yeees
[06:48:37] <_ramo> does anyone know, why the iframe height of this: http://jsfiddle.net/GUkQa/3/ is not calculated correctly?
[06:49:29] <seanr> Is it possible to do something like $(.image img) in jQuery to get the image tag inside a div with a class of image?
[06:49:50] <_ramo> sorry, this is the correct link: http://jsfiddle.net/GUkQa/4/
[06:50:37] <hermanus> le_gars, I'm sorry i don't understand your code at all
[06:51:39] <rfx_> Is there a way to download all themes from jqueryui ? I only find a way to select them individually and download one by one?
[06:52:17] <imsky> _ramo: what are you trying to do
[06:54:19] <le_gars> hmm ok. But did you understand what I wanted to do?? I have info in a json object. This info I want to display in a span. I do a ajax call and fetch the json and populate the span so that the number increases. If there are 5.000 people ative in surveys I want it to show that
[06:55:02] <le_gars> so I have that info in the json object I just need help with poulating the span correctly with it.
[06:55:09] <le_gars> did I make sense??
[06:55:30] <hermanus> showing the info in the span is the easiest part, but i do not understand how and what you are trying to count
[06:56:59] <hermanus> are you sure you pasted the right json code? there's no counting number in there
[06:58:05] <le_gars> oh ok. Well the data is coming from a database. So the ajax url goes to a method which is returning a json resultset from a databse. So when I recieve the data I want to increment the counter accordingly
[06:58:15] <le_gars> there was no counter??
[07:01:21] <le_gars> hermanus maybe it was an old version...http://pastie.org/1916401
[07:02:36] <Ely^> http://jsfiddle.net/nF7fU/5/ Hi, i have a problem that my previous image src is not put back when doing mouseleave, could some take a look please?
[07:05:45] <bazzo> Hi. Im using hide() to hide a div with a selectbox in it, as part of a form. Will the hidden div's be send along with the form?
[07:06:02] <hermanus> that's different code. but i meant the json object, the json object you pasted only contains information about one person, not a number. If json would return an object with a number, you could do target.html(parseInt(data.number)) . you do not need to increment/count anything, because you're getting the right number already. the server can do the counting.
[07:06:50] <imsky> bazzo: no
[07:07:13] <quicksilver> Ely^: this.src <--- you meant $this.attr('src')
[07:07:22] <bazzo> imsky, great, i was hoping for that :)
[07:08:04] <_ramo> imsky: i try to resize the iframe on the loaded content
[07:08:04] <bot-t> (5 mins 46 secs ago) <imsky> tell _ramo http://jsfiddle.net/GUkQa/5/
[07:09:52] <Ely^> no quicksilver, here is a working version
[07:10:03] <Ely^> but it shuold work also hovering the full text
[07:10:12] <Ely^> on .ui-state-default
[07:10:34] <tommy_the_dragon> i am having a problem getting the scrollFollow plugin to work properly see: http://african-pygmy-hedgehog.com/index.php/infomation/behaviours-a-personality
[07:10:54] <le_gars> ok so no incrementing then. It contains more the one person I just wnated to minimize the output. Bare in min that this data is just testdata that I have placed in the database http://pastie.org/1916440
[07:10:54] <quicksilver> Ely^: I don't understand. You said the problem was the image wasn't reset. I fixed that. Now you say tehre is another problem?
[07:11:36] <Ely^> yes http://jsfiddle.net/nF7fU/7/
[07:11:43] <Ely^> it only happens when hovering the image
[07:11:52] <Ely^> it shuold also happen when hovering the full wrap
[07:11:55] <tommy_the_dragon> heh nm, for reference the jquery scrollFollow plugin does not seem to be automatically setting target element to relative
[07:12:04] <Ely^> the table .ui-state-default
[07:12:41] <quicksilver> Ely^: no. You changed it wrong.
[07:13:03] <quicksilver> Ely^: why did you bind it to the $img instead of to the ui-state-default?
[07:13:14] <quicksilver> Ely^: all you had to do was make one simple change to the old version and it works
[07:13:19] <quicksilver> this.src -> $this.attr('src')
[07:15:01] <hermanus> le_gars, OK, then you'd only have to count the objects returned, like so: data.size() or data.length , then you'll know how much ppls are online
[07:15:13] <Ely^> yes yes quicksilver
[07:15:14] <Ely^> sorry
[07:15:19] <Ely^> my bad ,was checkng the wrong url
[07:15:20] <quicksilver> :)
[07:15:21] <Ely^> it's working yes
[07:15:25] <quicksilver> yay.
[07:15:26] <Ely^> cna i ask you another queistuin ?
[07:15:27] <jrich_> hi guys, quick question, just need a nudge in the right direction. Im looking to slide a drop down box from the center of the screen to the top left... wasnt able to find a method to assist me with that. whats the best way to go about this?
[07:15:28] <Ely^> questio
[07:15:28] <Ely^> n
[07:15:42] <_ramo> but imsky i still have to scroll
[07:15:58] <_ramo> i would like to have the original height, so that i don't need to scroll in the iframe
[07:16:00] <Ely^> i noticed when I click i get the down arrow, but it should not change to the previous src untill i click another one
[07:16:11] <lilis> hola, alguien que pueda ayudarme?
[07:16:21] <quicksilver> Ely^: well you change it back in mouseleave.
[07:16:29] <NoNoNo> Hi! How can I get the HTML-Attribute 'checked', not the DOM-property (like in jQuery 1.6)?
[07:16:33] <quicksilver> Ely^: you'll need to check on mouseleav and only change it back if it's not "clicked"
[07:16:44] <iivvoo> .attr("checked") ?
[07:16:49] <quicksilver> Ely^: ...and it's up to you how you stored the fact that it's clicked. You could use .data again, perhaps.
[07:17:10] <_ramo> imsky: the strange thing is, on another server, the same code is working
[07:17:11] <NoNoNo> iivvoo: I tried '[checked="checked"]'
[07:17:20] <BlaDe^> guys can anyone say for sure if it's possible to populate an <input type="file" /> via drag/drop ?
[07:17:24] <NoNoNo> but didnt work
[07:17:28] <_ramo> imsky: and this code is only not working in firefox.. in chrome and ie it work's great
[07:17:37] <Ely^> mmz ok
[07:17:39] <Ely^> i'll take a look
[07:18:06] <le_gars> hermanus: ok so like this basically target.html(parseInt(data.size)); ???
[07:18:25] <hermanus> le_gars, yes that will probably work
[07:18:25] <imsky> _ramo: hmm
[07:18:56] <le_gars> my god hermanus
[07:19:08] <djQuery> NoNoNo: are you trying to use it in a selector    $(':checked')
[07:19:09] <Fox`> gr the hotkeys plugin was made for 1.3. 1.4 broke it. someone updated it for 1.4. 1.5 broke it. is there no eeend :(
[07:19:14] <le_gars> you just saved my day....incredible...it worked
[07:19:21] <jqp> i'm trying to detect firings of the 'onreadystatechange' XMLHttpRequest event in jquery 1.6.0 using an ajax prefilter, but am getting some unexpected results.  when i alert the xhr's readyState value and responseText upon onreadystatechange, i see readyState values of 1, 2, 3 and 4 (see http://jsfiddle.net/4KFnh/2/).  however, when i append the readyState value to the document upon onreadystatecha
[07:19:23] <jqp> nge, i only see readyState of 1 (see http://jsfiddle.net/4KFnh/3/)
[07:19:30] <jqp> can anyone explain that?
[07:19:34] <le_gars> Thank you so much
[07:19:42] <le_gars> Very nice of you to take the time
[07:19:47] <hermanus> le_gars, i'm glad it helped! good luck with it
[07:19:53] <_ramo> imsky: could the doctype be a problem?
[07:19:59] <le_gars> thanks take care man
[07:20:02] <imsky> _ramo: i doubt it
[07:21:12] <hermanus> le_gars, you dont need to parse it anymore because its an integer already
[07:21:28] <imsky> _ramo: this is complicated because jsfiddle loads a different domain in the iframe, SOP is a barrier
[07:21:32] <le_gars> sorry??
[07:21:50] <hermanus>  target.html(data.size) is enough
[07:21:55] <_ramo> hm, maybe we should be the fiddle url in the src attribute? imsky?
[07:21:58] <le_gars> ahh ok
[07:22:06] <le_gars> great thanks again :)
[07:22:16] <Ely^> ok quicksilver it's not easy :p
[07:22:30] <jqp> does anyone here use jquery's ajax prefilters?
[07:22:44] <imsky> _ramo: not sure what you mean
[07:23:03] <le_gars> hermanus actually so data.size does not work but data.length does.
[07:23:23] <le_gars> anyhow I'm just happy it works
[07:23:34] <_ramo> imsky: i thought it would solve the problem with SOP when we put in the src attrribute of the iframe the address of fiddle itself... src="http://jsfiddle.net/GUkQa/5/"
[07:23:40] <_ramo> and run it to see if it works
[07:23:46] <imsky> _ramo: ah yeah, that could help
[07:24:45] <_ramo> it seems, that's not working too
[07:24:55] <_ramo> jsfiddle is loading and loading
[07:25:07] <imsky> yep
[07:25:11] <imsky> same here
[07:25:20] <_ramo> hm
[07:27:00] <electronplusplus> I've a jquery noob doubt
[07:27:02] <electronplusplus> http://pastebin.com/iD3WbKib
[07:27:09] <electronplusplus> in the function keyup()
[07:27:11] <hermanus> when i drag a ui.draggable it is duplicated and the duplicate is not droppable. Anyone know why this is? Just to be clear: i do not want it to be duplicated
[07:27:31] <electronplusplus> if I define like $("#id").keyup();
[07:27:34] <electronplusplus> it works
[07:27:39] <electronplusplus> otherwise it don't
[07:27:50] <electronplusplus> doesn't*
[07:28:07] <Fox`> i think i'm going to conclude that keyup/keydown/keypress is way too buggy to be used
[07:28:26] <electronplusplus> Fox`: I'm a jquery noob
[07:28:42] <Fox`> so am i somewhat
[07:28:48] <Fox`> but my script is too simple to get wrong
[07:29:06] <Fox`> i think you're going it wrong though
[07:29:22] <electronplusplus> where?
[07:29:51] <electronplusplus> ups
[07:30:03] <Fox`> should be like this http://pastebin.com/D3fMk8j6
[07:30:12] <Fox`> that's for pressing enter anywhere on the page
[07:30:34] <teleyinex> hi
[07:30:44] <electronplusplus> not really, I'm was defining keyup inside autocomplete
[07:30:54] <electronplusplus> btw Fox` show me your script
[07:30:56] <teleyinex> one question: I'm trying to use galleria http://galleria.aino.se/docs/1.2/getting_started/quick_start/
[07:31:23] <teleyinex> but I cannot make it work it getting images from Flickr using getJson and appending them to a <div>
[07:31:40] <Fox`> electronplusplus: http://pastebin.com/WpRjzWeF
[07:31:57] <Fox`> when enter is pressed on an element. also ignores when shift is used
[07:32:30] <Ely^> jfiddle is slow :(
[07:32:32] <Ely^> js*
[07:33:02] <electronplusplus> why shit ?
[07:33:30] <teleyinex> this is the source code: http://pastebin.com/vyGEmu5s
[07:33:39] <teleyinex> very simple (I guess :) )
[07:34:05] <_ramo> imsky: do you have an idea how to solve this issue?
[07:34:16] <imsky> _ramo: sorry on phone right now, can't pay attention
[07:34:29] <teleyinex> however, Galleria is only working for line 11 $("<img>").attr("src",URL).appendTo("#gallery");
[07:34:41] <Ely^> any great alternate sites like jsfiddle? it's down :o
[07:34:48] <_ramo> alright :)
[07:35:07] <teleyinex> while when I'm appending those <img> by the success callback of getJSON is not working
[07:35:16] <teleyinex> and I don't know what I'm doing wrong
[07:35:21] <teleyinex> can you help me?
[07:35:52] <electronplusplus> Fox`:  what happens with your script?
[07:37:31] <Fox`> electronplusplus: it executes send() twice
[07:37:40] <electronplusplus> hmm
[07:37:44] <electronplusplus> try keyup instead
[07:37:45] <Fox`> on opera the shift ignoring is ignored
[07:37:49] <Fox`> i tried them all
[07:37:53] <electronplusplus> lol
[07:38:01] <electronplusplus> the focus function works fine
[07:38:05] <Fox`> yeh
[07:38:49] <electronplusplus> let's think
[07:38:59] <electronplusplus> if the send() function is called twice
[07:39:12] <electronplusplus> is because the event keypress is being called twice Fox`
[07:39:24] <Wiz_KeeD> can someone please give me a suggestion on how i can make the top menu items here show only the gray part and on hover to slide down to the full size they are now?
[07:39:28] <Wiz_KeeD> http://gw.esserio.ro:30002/atlantis/
[07:39:28] <Fox`> yes
[07:39:34] <Wiz_KeeD> the top 4 buttons please
[07:39:53] <electronplusplus> I use keyup all the time and it works :\
[07:39:53] <Fox`> i'm just gonna add a timer so it can't execute twice within a few seconds
[07:40:03] <BlaDe^> does anyone have experience with drag/drop?
[07:40:28] <Corren> is there a jquery ui channel or just here?
[07:40:34] <electronplusplus> Wiz_KeeD: the left menu is fucked
[07:40:42] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLPa4Fsh4ak
[07:40:42] <Wiz_KeeD> you mean the right one?
[07:41:00] <electronplusplus> Wiz_KeeD: I see a menu over content on my left side
[07:41:04] <electronplusplus> using Mac OS with Chrome
[07:41:08] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance - lol
[07:41:10] <Wiz_KeeD> refresh electronplusplus
[07:41:16] <electronplusplus> Corren: I'm using jqueryui
[07:41:32] <electronplusplus> Wiz_KeeD: right side now
[07:41:33] <Corren> I didn't know if this was a come-all channel for jq
[07:41:33] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: What kind of drag & drop are you looking for? Just moving a certain <div>? Or files?
[07:41:41] <Wiz_KeeD> any suggestions on how i can implement the roll down effect?
[07:41:48] <Wiz_KeeD> http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/SlideDownBoxMenu/
[07:41:55] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance files --- I did a console.log of the File object and there's no path. I want to populate an <input type="file" />, though.
[07:42:04] <Wiz_KeeD> this looks lovely and is also for joomla but it's not exactly what i want and i can't seem to implement it
[07:42:22] <electronplusplus> Wiz_KeeD: jQuery plugin take some time to master and implement
[07:42:32] <Wiz_KeeD> that's just a module
[07:42:34] <electronplusplus> it really depends on documentation and examples provided
[07:42:39] <electronplusplus> with joomla?
[07:42:42] <Wiz_KeeD> yes
[07:42:47] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: Ah, well, I have no experience with that on the web! If you find anything out, please update me, because it might definitely be useful!
[07:42:52] <electronplusplus> I've never used Joomla so...
[07:42:54] <Wiz_KeeD> first of all, how do i just show the gray part on the bottom of the top menu tabs?
[07:43:02] <Wiz_KeeD> and slidedown with jquery onmouse over
[07:43:08] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance I found this: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Drag%27n%27Drop_Uploads#Finding_related_.3Cinput_type.3Dfile.3E
[07:43:27] <metap0d> Hi everyone, I am trying to familiarize myself with jQuery / php and was wondering if someone could help me with jQuery.post(); My file manages to be posted/returned but only as pure text ... I want to tell it that it is markup.
[07:43:31] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance but it doesn't explain what to set the input value to....
[07:43:53] <Ely^> how can i store something that is clicked in .DATA ?
[07:44:03] <Corren> anyone in the seattle area?
[07:44:17] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: It seems to me that that is a PROPOSAL.
[07:44:26] <rns> anyone know how to get this jquery to keep the first tab open on all forms in the loop? http://dpaste.com/543412/
[07:44:43] <metap0d> Oh sorry .. http://pastebin.com/cyHtt6em
[07:44:48] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance ah, yeah.. it is..
[07:45:14] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: Also, browsers don't allow you to set the "value" field of an input[type=file]
[07:45:26] <BlaDe^> I guess it can't be done then
[07:45:29] <MatthiasVance> (because then obviously, you could upload ANY file)
[07:45:32] <BlaDe^> how does imgur.com do it?
[07:45:44] <MatthiasVance> That's a good question, let's find out!
[07:46:14] <MatthiasVance> Ah, it only works in very modern browsers.
[07:46:57] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: That only works in Firefox and Chrome.
[07:47:04] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance I don't mind, that's fine
[07:47:14] <BlaDe^> I have a traditional browse button for anyone else
[07:47:21] <MatthiasVance> Well, then you know where to search! :)
[07:47:37] <maikoool> i need to get the value of a currently user selected radiobutton with jquery, how do i do that?
[07:47:55] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance i've tried
[07:48:26] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/12/w3c-fileapi-in-firefox-3-6/
[07:48:36] <Corren> who are the resident jquery experts?
[07:48:39] <BlaDe^> aha!
[07:48:54] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: Query used to find that was "firefox drag drop upload", it was the third result!
[07:49:00] <metap0d> maikoool: $('ans').is(':checked')
[07:49:09] <MatthiasVance> Corren: Do you really want to know that, or do you just have a question related to jquery?
[07:49:22] <Corren> I really want to know
[07:49:49] <Wiz_KeeD> help anyone on my prob?
[07:50:15] <metap0d> Hi everyone, I am trying to familiarize myself with jQuery / php and was wondering if someone could help me with jQuery.post(); My file manages to be posted/returned but only as pure text ... I want to tell it that it is markup.
[07:50:25] <metap0d> Script: http://pastebin.com/cyHtt6em
[07:50:27] <maikoool> @metap0d, thanks
[07:50:38] <metap0d> maikoool: No problemo!
[07:50:42] <AdvoWork> if im doing: <div class="ui-datetime-calendar-'+className+'"><button class="ui-datepicker-close ui-state-default ui-priority-primary ui-corner-all" onclick="$(this).hide();"   what would (this) be representing? the button? or the div?
[07:51:05] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: Do note that there might have been updates to the API, you can look that up on MDC.
[07:51:14] <jqp> metap0d: have you tried setting the "Content-type" HTTP header in the response?
[07:51:17] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance the ydon't seem to populate an input there, just read from it
[07:51:32] <sveri1> hi there, any ideas how i can debug the 'script stopped working' problem?
[07:51:51] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: Read on, click links in the blog, and you'll end up here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_files_from_web_applications
[07:52:00] <metap0d> jqp: Nope I haven't... I was reading the documentation on jQuerys site and it said it will attempt to guess the type of data but I can also specify it, which I tried to do as "html"
[07:52:18] <thomas8> hey hello
[07:52:25] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance: http://pastie.org/private/ixf3jcytsag9ptwavubpra <- what I have so far
[07:52:33] <jqp> metap0d: do you have firebug installed?  or do you just chrome/safari?
[07:52:44] <SilentPenguin> sveri1: you mean if you enter an infinate loop? with a profiler.
[07:53:00] <sveri1> SilentPenguin: which profiler can i use?
[07:53:05] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: I can't help you finish it though.
[07:53:06] <thomas8> I found a broken link in the online documentation http://jqueryui.com/docs/animate is empty
[07:53:10] <jqp> sveril: the one in firebug
[07:53:11] <metap0d> I've been testing in Chrome but I do have Firefox/Firebug .. not very familiar with the web dev tools jstyet
[07:53:13] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance sure I know that :-)
[07:53:18] <thomas8> from this page http://jqueryui.com/docs/Effects/Methods
[07:53:27] <SilentPenguin> chrome and IE have built in ones or firefox's firebug provides a profiler
[07:53:35] <sveri1> hm, i've been profiling with firebug, but havent found something useful
[07:53:50] <sveri1> SilentPenguin: the problem is, the error only occurs from time to time
[07:53:57] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance -- that link just shows again, how to show image previews with drag/drop
[07:54:06] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance it doesn't show how to populate the input
[07:54:40] <jqp> metap0d: in firebug, open the 'Net' tab, click on the response to post request you're investigating
[07:54:44] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: That's because it doesn't work that way.
[07:54:53] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: Read "Selecting files using drag and drop".
[07:55:02] <thomas8> is there an admin from jqueryui?
[07:55:06] <ccampbell> metap0d did you try $("#test").html(data)  vs. .text()   ?
[07:55:23] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance I have --- so it isn't possible tod ow hat I want?
[07:55:25] <SilentPenguin> sveri1: well, an infinate loop is usually contained to a small area, try viewing the profile as top down, if it isn't then you are going to have fun finding it :P
[07:55:49] <EnlightenMental> I'm using jquery to do some ajax paging.. but I cant seem to use jquery on the elements i dynamically change
[07:55:50] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: Not if your end-goal is to change the value of input[type=file]
[07:55:51] <sveri1> SilentPenguin: :D i had fun the whole day already and i am running out of ideas :(
[07:55:54] <EnlightenMental> http://collabedit.com/62jvc  <= example
[07:56:18] <jqp> metap0d: then look at the 'Content-type' header (if it exists) for that response.  it should say something like 'text/html', 'text/plain', or 'text/xml'
[07:56:19] <EnlightenMental> after I load the html, jQuery('.cat-list li a img').fadeTo('fast', .30);  doesnt seem to work
[07:56:32] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance can I create a new input with the file object, instead?
[07:56:51] <metap0d> jqp: I have Content-Type	text/html on the Header ... weird ; o
[07:57:07] <SilentPenguin> but, sveri1, "stopped running" usually means the script is still running, just in circles, so there really isn't much option other than using your noodle :P
[07:57:16] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: I don't know. Another way would be to just overwrite the input[type=file] with an input[type=text] and a button!
[07:57:32] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: But then you can't use Browse anymore.
[07:57:50] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance I can upload from an <input type="text" /> ?
[07:57:55] <jonkri> is it possible to POST upload a file through an ajax request and parse the resulting json?
[07:58:59] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: Explain to me again why do you even WANT the path to be shown, instead of the file being uploaded?
[07:59:14] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance I don't want it to be shown
[07:59:36] <MatthiasVance> Then why are you asking these questions related to it? Using the File API in firefox, you just have drag & drop upload.
[07:59:41] <MatthiasVance> Implementation details are on that page.
[07:59:51] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance I want it ot work with my existing form, not replace it
[08:00:17] <BlaDe^> that's why I wanted to create a new <input type="file" />
[08:00:17] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: But that's not how it works.
[08:00:43] <MatthiasVance> You just allow people to drop files on your form instead, process them (INSTEAD of submitting the form)
[08:01:27] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance hmm, will I need to change my PHP?
[08:01:32] <BlaDe^> or is the upload/post the same?
[08:01:49] <MatthiasVance> I don't know, I suppose it's the same (since you have control).
[08:02:25] <muley> BlaDe^: i use the jquery form plugin... submits an <input type=file through an iframe: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#file-upload
[08:02:26] <rosshadden> When a jQueryUI dialog is modal, you can scroll the page behind it with mousewheel, but not by clicking the native browser scrollbar. Can someone help me come up with a workaround/solution?
[08:02:30] <ccampbell> metap0d all you have to do is change $("#test").text(data)   to $("#test").html(data);
[08:03:27] <rosshadden> To recreate: go to http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-message and try to scroll the page (make sure it is too short for the content) with scrollbar vs mousewheel
[08:03:34] <BlaDe^> muley that seems to do exactly what I want
[08:03:37] <metap0d> ccampbell: Ah you're awesome ... I honestly overlooked it completely since  was specifying html further down ..
[08:04:04] <ccampbell> no problem, glad i could help!
[08:04:24] <AdvoWork> if im doing: <div class="ui-datetime-calendar-'+className+'"><button class="ui-datepicker-close ui-state-default ui-priority-primary ui-corner-all" onclick="$(this).hide();"   what would (this) be representing? the button? or the div?
[08:05:17] <hermanus> AdvoWork, the button
[08:05:59] <muley> BlaDe^: great :) ... works well for me too
[08:06:59] <muley> make sure you read about the textarea thing. that's the 1 little caveat
[08:07:09] <airstrike> hi. how can i programatically check/uncheck a checkbox?
[08:07:13] <liquid-silence> hi all
[08:07:18] <airstrike> sort of like .toggle(), but for checking/unchecking rather than hiding/showing
[08:07:19] <liquid-silence> whats the the best wizard for jquery
[08:07:40] <rosshadden> airstrike: $('#checkbox').prop('checked',true)
[08:07:43] <hermanus> airstrike, attr('checked', true)
[08:08:11] <airstrike> ok, thanks
[08:08:17] <rosshadden> hermanus: http://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-16-and-attr/
[08:08:31] <hermanus> rosshadden, thanks
[08:08:48] <electronplusplus> using jQuery UI how can I trim stuff inside the autocomplete()?
[08:09:21] <rosshadden> electronplusplus: I believe you can set the height of the results box, is that what you want? or to truncate your results
[08:09:32] <BlaDe^> muley I can't find the drag/drop example
[08:09:39] <BlaDe^> the demo code is here: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/malsup-form-demo.js
[08:09:46] <BlaDe^> but i can't see how their drag/drop works
[08:09:57] <electronplusplus> rosshadden: I want to trim the input box
[08:09:59] <Fox`> yay fixed my keydown issue
[08:10:04] <electronplusplus> example : 'james bond'
[08:10:16] <electronplusplus> if the user puts 'james bond ' it fails
[08:10:24] <electronplusplus> Fox`: how?
[08:10:41] <rosshadden> hermanus: that wasn't what I meant to link you to by the way, it was this http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/12/jquery-1-6-1-released/
[08:10:51] <liquid-silence> anyone?
[08:10:54] <MatthiasVance> BlaDe^: That's because it doesn't work that way.
[08:11:05] <Fox`> electronplusplus: keydown returns a timestamp. just recoreded the last time stamp and compared them. stopped it submitting if they were the smae
[08:11:06] <rosshadden> hermanus: Honestly I have yet to use $.fn.prop() and have been sticking with attr, but whatevs
[08:11:07] <Fox`> same*
[08:11:17] <electronplusplus> Fox`: LOL
[08:11:22] <electronplusplus> nice fix
[08:11:27] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance what?
[08:11:41] <BlaDe^> MatthiasVance test it: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#file-upload
[08:11:51] <BlaDe^> that's what I want to do
[08:12:12] <MatthiasVance> I don't see anything drag & drop about that.
[08:12:37] <BlaDe^> drag/drop a file next to the button
[08:13:11] <MatthiasVance> I did drop one on the form, and one on the input box, I'll try one "next to the button".
[08:13:33] <muley> BlaDe^: i dont think it's drag and drop... i caught the tail end of that convo when i sent that recommendation =\
[08:13:33] <MatthiasVance> It doesn't work here. :)
[08:13:47] <hermanus> rosshadden, interesting changes. I'm glad .attr still works, but I'll try getting used to prop. Hadn't noticed the changes yet. Thanks.
[08:13:56] <BlaDe^> drag/drop on that page is working for me
[08:13:58] <BlaDe^> perhaps that's just chrome?
[08:14:14] <MatthiasVance> muley: BlaDe^ seems to fail to understand how the File API works in Firefox. As in, does not use a form, AT ALL.
[08:14:37] <liquid-silence> why would jwizard + tinymce not play nicely?
[08:14:39] <BlaDe^> I do understand that... I only asked if I could do what I wanted, you said yes
[08:14:40] <AdvoWork> hermanus, how can i make it for the div?
[08:14:46] <BlaDe^> and kept sending me links to pages which don't do what I want
[08:14:57] <liquid-silence> it blocks the tinymce editor, although the buttons get created etc....
[08:15:09] <hermanus> AdvoWork, $(this).parent()
[08:16:12] <hermanus> AdvoWork, you can use console.debug($(this)); if you're in doubt where $this is pointing
[08:16:41] <Mafia> is there any better debugger for js for ie better than F12 ?
[08:17:01] <hermanus> Mafia, have you tried firebug lite?
[08:17:10] <Mafia> nope
[08:17:14] <rosshadden> Oooh!!
[08:17:16] <Mafia> but that loads it in an iframe no?
[08:17:21] <liquid-silence> this is mind boggling!
[08:17:22] <Mafia> or something like that
[08:17:22] <hermanus> it's a js script
[08:17:24] <liquid-silence> fark
[08:17:45] <Mafia> oka
[08:17:50] <rosshadden> Thanks hermanus. I have used firebug lite on chrome once (when seeing how jsbin does it) but never clicked that I could use it in IE
[08:17:54] <hermanus> it's not an iframe afaik
[08:18:41] <Mafia> is cos I am getting some ie7 errors on www.tweeshot.com
[08:19:33] <hermanus> i load firebug lite with <!--[if IE ]> tags
[08:19:59] <rosshadden> I use the bookmarklet
[08:21:11] <liquid-silence> ok so jquery-wizard is not working like I required, anyone know of better ones?
[08:21:22] <ddoom__> is it possible to stop all animations using a single function call?
[08:21:42] <hermanus> ddoom__, its possible
[08:21:43] <AdvoWork> hermanus,  that worked: $(this).parent().hide(); but what if i want to hide() a div with a certain id? or can't i?
[08:22:05] <hermanus> AdvoWork, you can $('#divid').hide();
[08:22:06] <quicksilver> $('#certainid').hide(), AdvoWork ?

[08:30:05] <sqrbrkt> hi all, I'm trying to use autocomplete in WordPress backend. My custom jquery-ui build seems to be getting loaded, but in Firebug console I'm still getting "autocomplete is not a function" error. Any suggestions?
[08:31:43] <rns> anyone know how to get this jquery to keep the first tab open on all forms in the loop? http://dpaste.com/543412/
[08:32:27] <hermanus> sqrbrkt, can it be a conflict with another framework or a conflict with the jquery ui thats in wp?
[08:33:04] <liquid-silence> is there a onShow event for a div
[08:33:12] <liquid-silence> IE when it gets shown to the browser
[08:33:16] <liquid-silence> from a hidden state
[08:34:17] <liquid-silence> I want to bind the div's show event to alert something
[08:35:29] <hermanus> liquid-silence, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1225102/jquery-event-to-trigger-action-when-a-div-is-made-visible have you tried that first answer?
[08:35:38] <bhavesh> My Javascript code works only in Google Chrome and not in Firefox why so?
[08:35:54] <bhavesh> a <div> does not change its position, rather disappears in frefox
[08:35:58] <bhavesh> firefox
[08:37:17] <sqrbrkt> hermanus: yes you're probably right, but I'm finding it tricky to track down. No other frameworks in use, so it must be wp ui. I've tried to just enqueue jquery.ui.autocomplete.js but then I get "$.widget is not a function"...
[08:37:24] <liquid-silence> hermanus if I go $("#divId").bind("afterShow", function(e) { alert("test"); });
[08:37:28] <liquid-silence> it does nothing
[08:39:52] <liquid-silence> I need to bind to something that happens when it comes out of a invisible state
[08:39:58] <hermanus> liquid-silence, actually i just meant the idea of extending the fn.show function, i hadnt even seen the afterShow function
[08:40:34] <hermanus> liquid-silence, saving the old .show function, running your own function and calling the original .show
[08:40:59] <liquid-silence> can one get a list of events?
[08:42:28] <GreyTrilby> afternoon all
[08:42:30] <jonkri> i POST into a (hidden) iframe... is there a way i can parse the string/json on that (iframe) page?
[08:43:10] <hermanus> sqrbrkt, did you make sure jquery is loaded before ui?
[08:43:13] <sqrbrkt> hermanus: ok the clue was in the error - jquery.ui.widget needed to load first. Now jquery.ui.autocomplete appears to be loading, but still I'm getting "autocomplete is not a function"
[08:44:09] <GreyTrilby> Could I please trouble someone for a little assistance?
[08:45:03] <hermanus> sqrbrkt, and apart from that the jquery version used in wordpress might not be compatible with your custom ui version
[08:45:07] <alexparker> greetings jquers
[08:46:03] <GreyTrilby> afternoon alex :)
[08:46:17] <m3nt0r> hi all! is there a known issue with element.css('borderWidth')? i tried border-width, borderWidth and border. i always get an empty string back. its an inline style on the elem.
[08:46:19] <hermanus> sqrbrkt, i would try deregistering 'jquery' and 'jquery-ui' (thats what theyre called i believe) and loading your own
[08:46:36] <hermanus> and see if its different then, then you're sure its not caused by conflicts
[08:47:11] <ch3mical> bhavesh: I suggest you start stack-tracing
[08:47:23] <sqrbrkt> hermanus: thanks, I tried that too with the same problem. I think actually my console test is wrong - let me check...

[08:47:50] <ch3mical> m3nt0r: try element.borderWidth?

[08:48:04] <bot-t> bhavesh, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[08:48:11] <GreyTrilby> I'm using tabs to build an app. I have a page (test.php) which when I load in a tab works perfectly. I then save 'test.php' as 'live.php' and open in a different tab - it doesn't work at all. Any thoughts please?
[08:48:15] <m3nt0r> ch3mical: not yet. i thought im supposed to use css() for that.
[08:48:27] <ch3mical> m3nt0r: There's no "supposed-to"
[08:49:15] <ch3mical> m3nt0r: .borderWidth is the standard JS method, where .css() is jQuery specific, if the jQ method isn't working, resort back to standard JS, if that doesn't work you're doing something wrong somewhere else
[08:49:25] <sqrbrkt> hermanus: $('some_text_field_id').autocomplete() should work, right?
[08:49:37] <ch3mical> m3nt0r: perhaps not selecting the element properly
[08:49:58] <ch3mical> sqrbrkt: Don't forget the #
[08:50:13] <sqrbrkt> erk....
[08:50:29] <ch3mical> And the ;
[08:50:30] <ch3mical> ;p
[08:50:43] <m3nt0r> m3nt0r: ok, i thought css deals with crossbrowser issues. not sure if native is "safe". anyway.. going to do it the direct way
[08:51:32] <hermanus> sqrbrkt, that should work. and if you 're not sure just paste the demo in your page and check if that loads: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[08:51:41] <ch3mical> m3nt0r: it's at least worth it to test, maybe the element you're trying to work with is the wrong one, or doesn't have that css style (or maybe it gets that style later?)
[08:52:04] <ch3mical> m3nt0r: point being, if you try that it may help you learn why .css() wasn't working
[08:52:12] <sqrbrkt> $('some_text_field_id') returns the element, $('#some_text_field_id') returns null...
[08:52:38] <GreyTrilby> ooh - another hat-related name
[08:53:02] <hermanus> sqrbrkt, that element is probably created by jquery from the string you 're entering, you should select with css selectors
[08:53:04] <sqrbrkt> hermanus: good idea, thanks
[08:54:18] <GreyTrilby> Hi chaps - I'm using tabs to build an app. I have a page (test.php) which when I load in a tab has other jquery that works perfectly. I then save 'test.php' as 'live.php' and open in a different tab - it doesn't work at all, but there are no errors in Firebug or my error console. Any thoughts please?
[08:54:42] <sqrbrkt> hermanus: nope, the element is not being created. I know this because it shows the correct name attribute
[08:54:59] <sqrbrkt> for some reason the css selector returns null...
[08:55:09] <sqrbrkt> perhaps related to WP using noConflicts wrapper
[08:55:13] <m3nt0r> ch3mical: yup, accessing element.get(0).style.borderWidth works
[08:56:01] <quicksilver> sqrbrkt: if $('some_text_field_id') works then you have prototype loaded.
[08:56:16] <quicksilver> sqrbrkt: (and prototype is splatting your $ so you can't reach jQuery there)
[08:56:51] <liquid-silence> hermanus got that to work
[08:56:57] <quicksilver> try jQuery('#some_text_field_id').autocomplete(....)
[08:56:57] <liquid-silence> now the wizrd buttons dont work
[08:57:00] <liquid-silence> I think they step it
[08:57:06] <sqrbrkt> quicksilver: let me check - thanks
[08:57:16] <quicksilver> (and read about combining prototype and jquery on a page)
[08:58:24] <hermanus> sqrbrkt, when working in WP always use noconflict like this: $h=jQuery.noConflict();, and select with your custom jquery shortname. $h('#element').autocomplete()
[08:59:02] <sqrbrkt> quicksilver: hermanus: no reference to prototype in the source. But jQuery('#element_id').autocomplete() works! Thanks guys for your help!
[08:59:03] <eee_mk> hi, what chart libraries can you recommend? besides raphael and google Vis... free license preferred
[08:59:22] <charlesbdudley> highcharts
[08:59:32] <quicksilver> sqrbrkt: I expect WP brings prototype in somehow.
[08:59:35] <charlesbdudley> http://www.highcharts.com/
[08:59:40] <GreyTrilby> \bangs head on brick wall
[08:59:40] <charlesbdudley> what we use on Klout.com
[08:59:50] <eee_mk> not entirely free, but thanks
[09:00:09] <sqrbrkt> quicksilver: you might be right. I had no idea :)
[09:00:18] <charlesbdudley> eee_mk: oh, sorry didn't fully read your question,
[09:01:38] <GreyTrilby> what's the best way to trap jquery errors where none are being shown in firebug?
[09:03:35] <sqrbrkt> Is it possible to use a select form element as the autocomplete source?
[09:04:23] <GreyTrilby> \me sits quietly sobbing in the corner
[09:04:28] * GreyTrilby does do
[09:04:53] <hermanus> sqrbrkt, put the values in an array and then you can use it as source for the autocomplete function
[09:05:05] <geekbuntu> if you dribble tribly you gotta clean it up
[09:05:36] * GreyTrilby pulls out a tissue
[09:05:44] <sqrbrkt> hermanus: cool, thanks. autocomplete just needs a regular text field
[09:05:52] <GreyTrilby> it's not the dribble you need to worry about - it's the snot
[09:06:04] <sqrbrkt> hermanus: sorry, pressed enter by accident. I shall read up on autocomplete
[09:06:15] <sqrbrkt> hermanus: thanks again for your help
[09:07:03] <hermanus> sqrbrkt, np, good luck, once the conflicts are gone it's happy coding in WP
[09:07:18] <MatthiasVance> So, I'm using jQuery UI's Dialog, and I can't seem to get two to show at the same time!
[09:07:49] <GreyTrilby> Can anyone please advise why jquery wouldn't work on one of two identical pages?
[09:12:06] <GreyTrilby> Can anyone please advise why jquery wouldn't work on one of two identical pages?
[09:14:16] <TeddyMurray> question, has anyone used weekcalendar plugin for jquery?
[09:17:14] * GreyTrilby cries for help
[09:17:21] <GreyTrilby> Can anyone please advise why jquery wouldn't work on one of two identical pages?
[09:17:43] <hermanus> GreyTrilby, it should work, can you show the code?
[09:19:21] <spixy> hello..
[09:19:32] <GreyTrilby> hey spixy
[09:19:42] <spixy> i wanna ask something
[09:20:08] <GreyTrilby> ask away - not sure if you'll get an answer though
[09:20:19] <spixy> its simple any..
[09:20:19] <TeddyMurray> GreyTrilby, could you show us some code?
[09:20:33] <GreyTrilby> Teddy - sure
[09:20:47] <Fox`> append() needs an onComplete parameter
[09:20:49] <TeddyMurray> the pages are precisely identical?
[09:20:52] <GreyTrilby> yep
[09:20:58] <spixy> how to replace a word with a word with link
[09:21:02] <GreyTrilby> basically i was having a problem with a page
[09:21:23] <GreyTrilby> (for the sake of argument called 'live.php')
[09:21:24] <spixy> $('spixy').replaceWith('<a href=#>spixy</a>');
[09:21:37] <spixy> would that work?
[09:21:50] <TeddyMurray> no spixy, you must do find('spixy') i think..
[09:22:03] <spixy> ofcourse..
[09:22:08] <spixy> i mean...
[09:22:16] <GreyTrilby> so I rebuilt the page and called it 'test.php'
[09:22:23] <spixy> if the html contains spixy
[09:22:25] <GreyTrilby> in my tab layout, test.php worked a treat
[09:22:40] <Whirl3d> Good Morning all. How do I check (within a loaded script) if other scripts are loaded and then load them if not?
[09:22:40] <GreyTrilby> so I renamed it (via save as) to 'live.php', overwriting the original
[09:22:42] <spixy> it would be replaced with <a href=#>spixy</a>
[09:22:44] <hermanus> spixy, .replace('old','new')
[09:23:13] <GreyTrilby> when I loaded 'live.php' into the tabs, it wouldn't work
[09:23:17] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: check if an object from that file is defined or not
[09:23:18] <spixy> @hermanus
[09:23:26] <spixy> will that work?
[09:23:32] <TeddyMurray> are you getting any firebug errors?
[09:23:40] <spixy> nope.
[09:23:47] <TeddyMurray> i meant GreyTrilby, sorry spixy
[09:23:48] <GreyTrilby> nope, none whatsoever
[09:24:25] <spixy> let me test what hermanus suggest
[09:24:26] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: to extend that answer, javascript doesn't have a sence of script files, it all merge into the scope
[09:24:34] <hermanus> spixy, yes, varString.replace('stringtofind', 'newstring');
[09:24:40] <TeddyMurray> yeah that will work spixy
[09:24:43] <last1> when doing a POST through .ajax is it normal to see on the other server that it's actually sending OPTIONS
[09:24:48] <Frazz> Hello, I've got the following line of code: $('#myId').find('li.expanded').find('ul').first().fadeTo('slow', 0.65); But I'm getting an error "first is not a function"... I'm thinking that after the find() functions the result is not a jquery object... but I have no idea how to verify this. Any ideas how I'd get only the first ul element?
[09:24:54] <GreyTrilby> Teddy: = http://greytrilby.no-ip.info/smhadmin - once you're in, choose the 'edition pages' link
[09:24:54] <spixy> so whats the complte line
[09:25:01] <Whirl3d> Cork, thanks for replying. How do I test if a function exists?
[09:25:03] <TonkaTruck> This is crazy, but, shouldn't the ajax error callback pass an argument that is similar to the success argument?  Where the response is parsed as determined by dataType?
[09:25:29] <hermanus> Frazz, use eq(0)
[09:25:29] <Cork[home]> Whirl3d: if its a global function window.function_name == undefined
[09:25:38] <GreyTrilby> there's two tabs - one called 'formtest' (at the end) and one called 'copy' - they are running identical code. formtest works, copy doesn't :(
[09:25:44] <Whirl3d> Cork, thanks, I'll give it a try.
[09:25:57] <TonkaTruck> Right now the only way to access the server response in the error callback is via the plain xhr.responseText property
[09:26:14] <TonkaTruck> Which doesn't seem to honor dataType
[09:26:15] <Frazz> @hermanus Awesome, thanks! I'll give it a try.
[09:26:48] <TeddyMurray> GreyTrilby, that's because the elements are probably named the same
[09:26:57] <lastent> hi, I am trying, to append a return from an ajax request, it has an javascript code inside, but this code is not being evaluated, what can I do?
[09:26:59] <TeddyMurray> and when you do $("#element") it's referring to the first one on the DOM
[09:27:11] <spixy> is this right? $.replace('spixy','<a href=#>spixy</a>);
[09:27:18] <GreyTrilby> so if I get rid of one page and try again, it should work?
[09:27:25] <TeddyMurray> yeah GreyTrilby
[09:27:26] <TeddyMurray> :)
[09:27:41] <spixy> ?
[09:27:56] <Cork[home]> lastent: generally you don't have a return from an ajax call, you can a callback, its async so no return value
[09:28:11] <Cork[home]> *you have a callback
[09:28:32] <hermanus> Frazz, or try $('#myId').find('li.expanded>UL:first-item'), i think that'll work, but i might be wrong
[09:28:55] <Cork[home]> item?
[09:29:05] <Cork[home]> ?:first
[09:29:06] <bot-t> :first: Selects the first matched element. http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[09:29:08] <Frazz> @hermanus Your first suggestion worked! Horray!
[09:29:23] <Cork[home]> ?:first-child
[09:29:23] <bot-t> :first-child: Selects all elements that are the first child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/
[09:29:26] <spixy> ?
[09:29:41] <admin_> ajpiano,
[09:29:42] <hermanus> ah, thanks Cork, i had a feeling something was wrong
[09:29:50] <TeddyMurray> GreyTrilby, or if you just rename the id's of the elements for one of the pages
[09:29:52] <TeddyMurray> it will work
[09:29:55] <TeddyMurray> for both
[09:29:57] <TeddyMurray> if you need both
[09:30:01] <lastent> Cork[home], but I need the return, it is an html to update a div
[09:30:03] <admin_> I am using a json URL in my source: but itt's port port 80, how to I define a port in my call?
[09:30:03] <spixy> is this right $.replace('spixy','<a href=#>spixy</a>);
[09:30:08] <Frazz> @hermanus Just as a further note, I had tried 'ul:first' and it didn't work. It didn't kick out any errors either..
[09:30:22] <Cork[home]> lastent: ya but you need to handle it in the callback
[09:30:33] <Frazz> @hermanus But .eq(0) worked perfectly!
[09:30:36] <hermanus> Frazz, so find('li.expanded>UL:first') shoud also work
[09:30:42] <TeddyMurray> spixy, no it isn't a jquery method, its STRING.replace('string','newstring');
[09:30:55] <TeddyMurray> replacing string with whatever string you need
[09:30:58] <hermanus> Frazz, yes, but this takes less resources
[09:31:07] <lastent> I am handling it in the success callback, but when I try to append it, the js part is not being evaluated
[09:31:14] <spixy> hmm
[09:31:16] <Frazz> @hermanus Nice, so I'll pop that in and give it a try.
[09:31:19] <lastent> Cork[home],  I am handling it in the success callback, but when I try to append it, the js part is not being evaluated
[09:31:26] <Cork[home]> lastent: ok, could you pb your code?
[09:31:26] <ajpiano> hermanus, .eq(0) is faster than :first selector
[09:31:27] <TeddyMurray> you can do var myString = $('#element').val() myString.replace('oldstring','newstring'); -- spixy
[09:31:30] <Cork[home]> ?p @ lastent
[09:31:30] <GreyTrilby> Teddy - nope, didn't work - removed the other page from the tabs and still nothing. If I replace it with formtest.php
[09:31:31] <bot-t> lastent, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[09:32:16] <spixy> so its not a jquery method? @ted
[09:32:28] <hermanus> ajpiano, hmm, it has to put al dom elements in the wrapper first. doesnt it only read the first dom element when using:first? or is that filtered afterwards?
[09:32:32] <TeddyMurray> nope spixy
[09:32:40] <ajpiano> it's filtered afterwards
[09:32:42] <michal-ba> Hi Guys! Is anybody here who has knowledges with jquery ui-tabs and also using it with the nested iframe? I have a couple troubles with using iframe in firefox,...
[09:32:42] <SoulRaven> hi
[09:32:49] <vacho> guys
[09:32:53] <spixy> whats the equivalent for jquey?
[09:33:05] <SoulRaven> any ideea how i get the id of a element, that is in the div, where i trigger a click?
[09:33:07] <predat0r> hi
[09:33:10] <maxmoore14> can someone take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/5nast/ and tell me why the dialog won't resize?
[09:33:12] <vacho> If I have a json URL as source in jquery autocomplete, does that json URL have to point to same domain??
[09:33:13] <spixy> it needs to be on jquery
[09:33:15] <TeddyMurray> hmm, im not sure then GreyTrilby D:, sorry
[09:33:21] <GreyTrilby> No worries.
[09:33:24] <last1> I have a jquery .ajax request that throws an error, how can I find out what it is ? so far I error: function(v1, v2, v3) { alert(v1); alert(v2); alert(v3); }
[09:33:27] <lastent> Cork[home], http://pastebin.com/KbLBDxvC
[09:33:37] <GreyTrilby> Interesting thing though - when in place in that second tab (alone) it doesn't work
[09:33:44] <last1> v1 simply prints XHR, v2 says 'error' and v3 is 'undefined'
[09:33:49] <GreyTrilby> if I put it in the final tab, it works fine!
[09:33:53] <Frazz> @hermanus Perfect! That worked as well. So then it was just a syntax issue for me.
[09:33:57] <predat0r> -- can I check somehow that a submit was successful?
[09:34:16] <vacho> ajpiano, please?
[09:34:18] <Cork[home]> lastent: and you get parsing error?
[09:34:28] <Cork[home]> or syntax error?
[09:34:30] <predat0r> I want to clear a cookie if submit was OK..
[09:34:36] <ec8or_> how can i bind a function to any event on any object?
[09:34:37] <SoulRaven> any ideea how i get the id of a element, that is in the div, where i trigger a click?
[09:34:54] <ec8or_> want to pop up a "page has changed" alert when user tries to close the browser without saving
[09:35:24] <spixy> @teddy...can you edit this.. var myString = $('#element').val() myString.replace('oldstring','newstring');
[09:35:25] <predat0r> SoulRaven $('#div').attr('id') ?
[09:35:25] <Cork[home]> ec8or_: only way is to bind events on the document and listen for bubbling events
[09:35:35] <Cork[home]> ec8or_: but there isn't any dom changed events
[09:35:39] <lastent> Cork[home], I dont get any error
[09:35:43] <ec8or_> SoulRaven: find()?
[09:35:55] <Cork[home]> lastent: what happens when the call happens then?
[09:36:00] <hermanus> Frazz, according to ajpiano the first suggestion is faster.. So choose what you like.
[09:36:04] <spixy> spixy is the word to be replaced by a link
[09:36:22] <lastent> see, the html part is append but the js is not
[09:36:34] <Cork[home]> ah, js isn't appended
[09:36:44] <Cork[home]> its added to the header as a script tag
[09:37:01] <Frazz> @hermanus Interesting, I'm writing both down for future reference.
[09:37:21] <spixy> hmmm
[09:37:27] <vacho> someone please: If I have a json URL as source in jquery autocomplete, does that json URL have to point to same domain??
[09:37:37] <orolo> SoulRaven:  $(this).attr('id');
[09:37:42] <Cork[home]> lastent: if i remember correctly from the filter comments, it leaks in some browsers, so its filtered out and put in the header instead
[09:38:19] <ajpiano> vacho: yes.
[09:38:29] <orolo> vacho:  yes; else you need jsonp (if i understand you correctly)
[09:38:33] <lastent> Cork[home], that is the problem, it is not being put on the headers
[09:38:38] <ajpiano> hermanus Frazz https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L263-265
[09:38:39] <Cork[home]> lastent: but if you write your js correctly taht shouldn't matter
[09:38:43] <michal-ba> guys, why when I do click on ui-tab and inside this code is iframe with url to action, then in the firefox browser always will fire postback to my controller?
[09:38:44] <SoulRaven> orolo: yes, but it find's me the id of the current class, i want to find the id of the div, that is in div that trigger the action
[09:38:54] <Cork[home]> lastent: thats wierd
[09:39:03] <hermanus> ajpiano, ah, thanks, so its just a filter
[09:39:11] <SoulRaven> i have some generated div's and i want to read the id, for future server side processing
[09:39:15] <ajpiano> yup
[09:39:22] <lastent> Cork[home], pretty wierd
[09:39:28] <ajpiano> hermanus Frazz, :first is a custom jquery selector, using those is actually one of the slower selector paths you can take
[09:39:35] <ajpiano> cause it can't go through querySelectorAll
[09:39:36] <ec8or_> Cork[home]: cheers
[09:39:55] <vacho> orolo: hmm..
[09:39:58] <ec8or_> can't really get my head around bubbles but i'll sort it out :)
[09:40:33] <Cork[home]> ec8or_: all events that isn't stoped, bubble up the dom tree until it hits the window element
[09:40:33] <Frazz> @ajpiano Sounds good to me.
[09:40:57] <Cork[home]> ec8or_: so a click or mousemove will get to there, no matter where it happens
[09:41:03] <hermanus> Frazz, find('li.expanded>UL').eq(0) is the fastest then
[09:41:09] <Cork[home]> ec8or_: thats why .live relays on
[09:41:16] <lastent> Cork[home], you know it is not being evaluated, I put an alert, and nothing happens
[09:41:43] <Cork[home]> lastent: try .html() instead, just for fun :)
[09:41:45] <djQuery> ?.contains
[09:41:46] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[09:41:58] <Frazz> @hermanus Nice.
[09:42:03] <Cork[home]> might be i though of it instead of append, but i think it did it too... /me checks
[09:42:05] <vacho> ajpiano, orolo: http://pastebin.com/BrnkuKRd that's my code. my source is on a different server. Did I put the port # in the right place?
[09:42:06] <lastent> Cork[home], where do I put .html?
[09:42:15] <Cork[home]> lastent: instead of append()
[09:42:45] <michal-ba> gyus, if you have time, plese wirte me via chat window... i need help with ui - tabs
[09:42:49] <GreyTrilby> @Teddy - renaming the edit button (and related jquery) seems to have solved half the problem. Certain other actions now aren't taking place, but I can troubleshoot those myself for now. Thanks for your help!
[09:42:52] <SoulRaven> i have some generated div's and i want to read the id, for future server side processing
[09:42:52] <Cork[home]> lastent: html replace the content of the parent, instead of adding to it
[09:43:33] <ec8or_> Cork[home]: ah, so if i bind a click event to the top div that will get triggered if a link is clicked inside it?
[09:43:38] <lastent> Cork[home], nothing, you know I think what is falling is the filtering, it is not evaluating my js
[09:43:55] <xsamurai> trying to add html links inside an alert popup , they show up as standard text
[09:43:57] <ec8or_> Cork[home]: but i guess if i have already a listener attached to that link that returns false that stops the bubbling?
[09:44:50] <TonkaTruck> I need some sort of ajax/rest website with test data.  Is there something like this?  I saw that someone owned testrest.com but there's nothing on it.
[09:45:11] <Cork[home]> ec8or_: yes it will
[09:45:24] <vacho> ajpiano, u are the only one that knows this, please help? :)
[09:45:24] <orolo> vacho: yeah, i think you need JSONP for cross domain.
[09:45:27] <ec8or_> Cork[home]: ok cool
[09:45:31] <Cork[home]> ec8or_: and ya, return false will kill the event
[09:45:35] <vacho> orolo: I put dataType: 'jsonp',
[09:45:44] <ajpiano> vacho: next time you're on a call remind me to annoy the shit out of you too ok
[09:45:46] <Jon47> ec80r it will also get triggered on clicks in any other elements within that div
[09:45:55] <orolo> vacho: it still says 'json'
[09:45:56] <vacho> ajpiano, lol, sorry mate
[09:46:00] <TonkaTruck> hahahaha
[09:46:02] <Jon47> you can use event.target (? i think…) to get the originating element of the event
[09:46:03] <orolo> ?jsonp
[09:46:04] <bot-t> JSONP, Quickly « plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[09:46:06] <Cork[home]> ec8or_: btw its recomended to use preventDefault() instead of return false;
[09:46:22] <vacho> orolo: I changed 'json' to 'jsonp'
[09:46:27] <Cork[home]> ec8or_: cause if you bind anything else to the element it won't get triggered
[09:46:49] <maxmoore14> anyone here know the ins and outs of the ui? I really need some help with resizing a dialog
[09:47:23] <TonkaTruck> maxmoore14: Did you see the docs for dialog?
[09:47:37] <maxmoore14> yes, read them through many times
[09:47:46] <TonkaTruck> maxmoore14: What are you having trouble with?
[09:47:52] <maxmoore14> TonkaTruck: http://jsfiddle.net/5nast/
[09:48:22] <lastent> Cork[home], it was my fault, I got the problem
[09:48:24] <lastent> thanks
[09:48:29] <TonkaTruck> maxmoore14: You didn't finish the fiddle heh.
[09:49:10] <SoulRaven> i have 2 div's, when i click on one div, i want to get the id from the secound div, any ideea how?
[09:49:28] <TonkaTruck> maxmoore14: What is the problem?  What do you want to happen during the resize event?
[09:49:45] <maxmoore14> it is that call to resize - it doesn't actually execute 'resize'
[09:50:13] <rns> anyone know how I can not hide all of my tab contents when I click on a new tab?  http://dpaste.com/543460/
[09:50:42] <orolo> SoulRaven: it depends on where the second div is.
[09:51:08] <orolo> SoulRaven: for example.
[09:51:43] <orolo> SoulRaven: $('#div1').click(function() { $(this).next().attr('id); }); would give you the next div's id.
[09:52:00] <orolo> SoulRaven: but you could use .sibling(), .child() etc.
[09:52:13] <TonkaTruck> maxmoore14: Are you trying to fire the resize callback by calling .dialog('resize')?  I didn't know you could do that.
[09:52:13] <SoulRaven> orolo: the secound div, is in the first
[09:52:26] <SoulRaven> and i want to get the id of the secound
[09:52:37] <orolo> SoulRaven: .child()
[09:52:42] <maxmoore14> TonkaTruck: yes, exactly - you can't :-)
[09:52:42] <TonkaTruck> I believe 'resize' is a callback for when the user resizes the dialog.
[09:52:49] <maxmoore14> that is correct
[09:53:03] <TonkaTruck> maxmoore14: Why would you want to?  Call the resize callback without the user resizing it?
[09:53:04] <orolo> SoulRaven: inside your click: $(this).child().attr('id'); should do it.
[09:53:07] <maxmoore14> but I want to trigger the event
[09:53:27] <orolo> SoulRaven: or something like that.
[09:53:47] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: Check out http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/ .  jQuery has a whole bunch of different methods for wandering around in the DOM depending on the relationship between the elements you're using/looking for.
[09:54:00] <maxmoore14> I have some complicated nested elements that are sized dynamically - right now the only way I can do it is to copy and paste the resize code into the open function
[09:54:14] <last1> I have the following error function for my .ajax request. My PHP scripts returns code 200 but jquery still triggers the error function
[09:54:14] <SoulRaven> thx, i will try now the options:)
[09:54:17] <xsamurai>  trying to add html links inside an alert popup , links show up as standard text
[09:54:28] <last1> I want to find out what the error is and why it goes there
[09:54:29] <TonkaTruck> Well, you could put your dialog controls inside an object literal and then just have your own resize function...which is called both in dialog's resize callback _and_ in dialog's open callback.
[09:54:36] <TonkaTruck> That way you don't have the same code in two places.
[09:54:51] <TonkaTruck> I virtually always have dialogs in object literals.
[09:55:28] <maxmoore14> could you show me a quick example?
[09:57:16] <mattyh88> i have this script. the markers are showing on the map, but the infowindows aren't shown when you click the marker: https://gist.github.com/976847
[09:57:40] <ec8or_> Cork[home]: nice one
[09:57:46] <SoulRaven> orolo: and if i have more elements, in the first div, and i want to catch the id only the id of the div, that is inside the first div?
[09:59:23] <panfist> good or bad idea: i have links of a certain class that i would like to modify if a key is held down. if p is held down, append "print"
[09:59:27] <panfist> to the url
[09:59:36] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: There's .first() and .last() to limit a group of returned elements, or you could filter with another selector ($('div#blah').find('.desiredclass'))
[10:01:35] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: ok, but i have more peers like that, and i want to catch the id of the secound element, ofter a click action
[10:02:15] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: .first().next() ?
[10:02:33] <electronplusplus> I'm about to kill some body
[10:02:42] <electronplusplus> I'm using Jquery UI
[10:02:55] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: But it sounds to me like it's be probably easier to identify the div in some way (id, class, etc).  But if you're trying to catch the div's id, I'm assuming it's dynamically generated.
[10:02:56] <electronplusplus> and something weird and stupid is happenig with autocomplete function
[10:03:14] <electronplusplus> this works fine-> source : "list_especialidade.php?term="+encodeURIComponent($(this).val()),
[10:03:26] <electronplusplus> and this one don't source : "list_medicos_especialidade.php?especialidade="+encodeURIComponent(especialidadeid),
[10:03:41] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: yes, is dinamicaly generate
[10:03:49] <electronplusplus> the second doesn't update when especialidadeid changes
[10:03:54] <maxmoore14> TonkaTruck: you still there?
[10:04:43] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: works, like that: var text = $(".catch").last().attr('id');
[10:05:07] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: but i make with last, i get the last peer, and if i make first, i get the first peer
[10:05:29] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: Yah.  That's what they do.  :)
[10:05:46] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: But if you need the second peer, you should be able to do $(".catch").first().next().
[10:05:50] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: but how i make to get the id of the peer i clicked
[10:06:26] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: Sounds like a job for $(this).  You may be thinking about this the wrong way.
[10:07:23] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: So, something like $(".theDivsYouWantToClickOn").click(function() { $('#theDivYouWantToAlert').doWhatever($(this).attr('id')) });
[10:07:38] <TonkaTruck> maxmoore14: I'm not sure why you want to trigger resize dialog before it's been resized.
[10:07:47] <TonkaTruck> Are you trying to size it?
[10:08:10] <maxmoore14> I'm trying to size elements inside it
[10:08:25] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: If I'm not understanding this right, can you put this in a fiddle so I can see what you're talking about?  jsfiddle.net
[10:08:45] <SoulRaven> yes i will put the generated code,
[10:09:46] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: http://jsfiddle.net/4qTAk/
[10:10:27] <SoulRaven> mysphyt; and when i click the bankrate class, i want to catch the id of the class lass="catch"
[10:13:14] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: brb, 10 minutes
[10:13:20] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: Kk.
[10:13:39] <panfist> to the url
[10:13:42] <maxmoore14> TonkaTruck: is this what you meant by using an Object wrapper? http://jsfiddle.net/5nast/2/
[10:13:43] <panfist> ignore me
[10:13:59] <predat0r> somebody use jquery.cookie.js?
[10:14:00] <vityav> Hey all. If you generate some html with jquery on pageload, can you then have jquery operate on that html with the same function if the code appears further in the function?
[10:14:17] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/4qTAk/1/
[10:15:01] <TonkaTruck> maxmoore14: or something like this http://jsfiddle.net/5nast/3/
[10:15:12] <TonkaTruck> open your debug console
[10:15:13] <mysphyt> vityav: Not sure what you're asking.  Once something is loaded in the DOM--either by the original HTML file, or dynamically added with jQuery--jQuery can operate on it, no matter how it got there.
[10:15:39] <mysphyt> vityav: Just as if it appeared in the original HTML.
[10:16:54] <vityav> So if I append a couple of <div class="whatever"> and then right after the append, do something like $("div.whatever").click(... ) it should be fine?
[10:17:31] <TonkaTruck> You can also use resizeStop and also name the function something like "resizeContent" etc
[10:17:57] <TonkaTruck> Though I can't imagine there isn't a css solution to what you're doing...heh
[10:18:01] <mysphyt> vityav: Yah.  You may need to use a callback--so if you're appending with for instance an ajax call, you'll need to wait 'til the ajax call is done before you start futzing with stuff.
[10:18:03] <maxmoore14> ok, thanks very much
[10:18:41] <zorph> in a scrolling div with css overflow..is it possible to set the scoll position with js ?
[10:18:46] <djQuery> too bad jquery.ui.autocomplete cant handle this by default. http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/4yBCR/
[10:19:22] <jonclark> have you tried yet, zorph? :)
[10:19:31] <vityav> mysphyt: Thank you. I imagine that's what is going wrong
[10:19:47] <TonkaTruck> zorph: there are some jquery scrollTo plugins
[10:20:18] <mysphyt> vityav: Np.  So you can, for instance, $("#div").load('path/to/whatever.html', function () { //do whatever once div is loaded. });
[10:21:41] <TonkaTruck> djQuery: I'm getting an error in jsfiddle's LayoutCM.js on your fiddle.
[10:21:47] <TonkaTruck> width is null
[10:23:16] <vityav> mysphyt: That did it. Thank you again :)
[10:23:22] <mysphyt> vityav: No problem.  :)
[10:23:24] <ch3mical> Has anyone here ever used Flexigrid?
[10:23:30] <TonkaTruck> djQuery: nevermind it went away
[10:27:30] <zorph> jonclark: no haven't tried..
[10:27:40] <zorph> jonclark: don't know where to start...
[10:27:55] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: i am back, any ideea how i manage to do ? you have look on my code?
[10:28:19] <zorph> jonclark: how can I try if I don't know what property to set?..
[10:28:22] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: Yeah.  There were a few problems, at least one of which lives in whatever's generating the code.
[10:28:36] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/4qTAk/1/
[10:29:00] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: First, both of your spans had the same ID, so it could never have worked anyway.  That's a problem in whatever's generating the HTML.  (Or possibly just a typo in the fiddle.)
[10:29:55] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: Oops.  I also forgot what the desired behavior was.  :P
[10:29:59] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/4qTAk/2/
[10:30:07] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: i see you examle, but i want to find the id of the secound div, not the first, the id of the div with class="catch"
[10:30:13] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: i see you examle, but i want to find the id of the secound div, not the first, the id of the div with class="catch"
[10:30:26] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: Yeah, that's what I forgot.  Check the update I just sent you.
[10:30:30] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: Yeah, that's what I forgot.  Check the update I just sent you.
[10:30:41] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: i see you examle, but i want to find the id of the secound div, not the first, the id of the div with class="catch"
[10:30:55] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: i see you examle, but i want to find the id of the secound div, not the first, the id of the div with class="catch"
[10:30:58] <mysphyt> I feel like we've had this conversation before.
[10:31:31] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: Are you normal yet?  Can I talk to you?
[10:31:38] <SoulRaven> yes
[10:31:40] <SoulRaven> i am here
[10:31:59] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/4qTAk/2/ I forgot that you were looking for .catch .  This update should be the desired behavior.
[10:32:36] <nerk> anyone know an elegant way to add a class to every third li in a list?
[10:32:44] <SoulRaven> mysphyt; i will try now, thx:)
[10:32:46] <Mafia> css3
[10:32:56] <nerk> right now doing a loop through them and some modulo to add the class

[10:33:40] <mello> hi, how can i send an array of ids through getJSON? And with that i mean, not how to return json, but how to send multiple id's in the 'data' part of getJSON
[10:33:49] <jonclark> if you wanted to do a homebrew solution you'd be using the offset properties (offsetTop, etc.)
[10:33:51] <mysphyt> joshontheweb: I'm pretty sure he was having connection problems.
[10:33:52] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: is working, thx, i will give a try now, with more peers of div's
[10:33:55] <nerk> will jquery understand the nth-child selector properly for IE?
[10:34:18] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: As long as there's only one div class='catch' in each span, you should be fine.
[10:35:06] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: this is teh layout, i need this div, because i need to split the string and make a ajax call, from ths id split string
[10:36:47] <Jayflux> nerk should do
[10:37:09] <mysphyt> SoulRaven: Heh, I don't care what you need it for.  That should work as long as you don't change what's in thw spans.  :P
[10:37:13] <mysphyt> *the

[10:39:22] <nerk> actually, $(selector).filter(":even") seems to work well
[10:39:32] <tin_nqn> hasClass returns true if any of them are true
[10:43:15] <last1> how can I see the error triggered by a .ajax request ?
[10:43:29] <mello> hi, how can i send an array of ids through getJSON? And with that i mean, not how to return json, but how to send multiple id's in the 'data' part of getJSON
[10:44:13] <Jon47> last1 .. make an error function?
[10:44:53] <diegoviola> how to debug ajax/js?
[10:45:10] <diegoviola> any tools for that?
[10:45:15] <diegoviola> firebug?
[10:45:17] <last1> I made this function: http://pastebin.com/g9bke43g  but it alerts an empty screen
[10:45:37] <Jayflux> error: function(msg){}
[10:45:40] <Jayflux> last 1
[10:45:54] <last1> and then: alert(msg); ?
[10:45:59] <Jayflux> indeed
[10:46:35] <last1> that prints: [object XMLHttpRequest]
[10:47:17] <hermanus> diegoviola, http://michaelsync.net/2007/09/30/firebug-tutorial-script-tab-javascript-debugging or use the developer tools included in chromium
[10:47:52] <Jayflux> last1 try
[10:48:05] <Jayflux> alert(msg.error());
[10:48:13] <Jayflux> see if that works
[10:48:55] <last1> nope. says that error() is not a function

[10:49:49] <diegoviola> :)
[10:53:48] <v0lZy> Hello
[10:54:37] <karega> I can't pass an object to setInterval?  i.e. setInterval('obj.methodCall()', 1000);
[10:55:04] <last1> so when doing an .ajax POST type request, should I see a POST on my http server ? because right now I see an OPTIONS request. "OPTIONS /signup/xml.php HTTP/1.1" 200 7
[10:55:24] <v0lZy> Can somone give me some advice on making my page DHTML or just HTML ... the thing is, I want to do a nice scroll effect of an element, that has lots of text (my entire page actually), but its overflow is hidden. I'm worried abou search engines etc. Do they index stuff that's in a div who's overflow is hidden?
[10:55:35] <v0lZy> Navigation done by anchor links etc, is that a bad idea?
[10:55:49] <Jon47> karega… try it without the single quotes and parens, ie: setInterval(obj.methodCall, 1000);
[10:55:51] <systemfault>  karega I guess you'll need a jquery proxy or something like that.
[10:56:09] <Anitox> v01Zy, search engines will see all the text in it, not just what is visible to a web browser.
[10:56:29] <Anitox> v01Zy, bots have trouble calling javascript which loads ajax pages, if that helps
[10:56:39] <Anitox> so, a links are better
[10:56:42] <Anitox> <a>
[10:56:55] <hermanus> v0lZy, it might not be indexed and you might even be marked as someone who tries to fool the search engine by having it indexing text that might not be shown to the user. so it's best to keep hiding to a minimum.
[10:56:58] <v0lZy> Anitox: what if its not ajax, just javascript?
[10:57:03] <Anitox> use ajax for loading data or bits of a page, dont use it for a whole page
[10:57:21] <Anitox> i dont think bots execute javascript
[10:57:27] <Anitox> some might
[10:57:28] <Jon47> or if you do use it for the whole page, make the content accessible via a canonical url as well
[10:57:38] <Anitox> yea
[10:57:44] <Jon47> and include meta links to those urls..
[10:57:53] <v0lZy> Hm, perhaps i should explain in more details
[10:57:58] <Anitox> indeed
[10:58:14] <v0lZy> I have like a menu with say 15 links, and clicking a link scrolls a div that has overflow:hidden
[10:58:28] <v0lZy> when the page loads, everything is on the page, its just not visible
[10:58:32] <Anitox> oh
[10:58:41] <v0lZy> if you look at the source code, everything is visible
[10:58:53] <v0lZy> I just use it to scroll that div up and down
[10:58:58] <Anitox> are you using <a name="my_page"> and <a href='#my_page'>  ?
[10:58:58] <v0lZy> and other divs inside that div
[10:59:03] <v0lZy> nothing is ajax generated
[10:59:24] <Anitox> bots will find all of that data
[10:59:30] <Anitox> even though the CSS or whatever has it hidden
[10:59:40] <v0lZy> Anitox: i use it like... <a href="#anchor" class="scroll">something</a>
[10:59:49] <Anitox> k, that should be fine
[10:59:58] <m4xx> i've updated from jquery 1.4 to jquery 1.6 and $(this).attr('checked') no longer works
[11:00:03] <v0lZy> Do I benefi with a name="" attribute?
[11:00:04] <m4xx> is there a new method of doing this?
[11:00:25] <Anitox> not really
[11:00:27] <hermanus> m4xx, prop() http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/12/jquery-1-6-1-released/
[11:01:01] <v0lZy> OK... so if i understand correctly... as long as my page source contains all the text, it will get indexed, even if showing, hiding that text is java controlled --- showing and hiding it from the view only
[11:01:15] <v0lZy> hermanus: will search engine penalize me for that?
[11:01:28] <v0lZy> I dont plan to stuff viagra and things like that there.
[11:01:41] <hermanus> v0lZy, no, but google does check if you use display:none and visibility:visible in your css
[11:01:50] <hermanus> so beter remove it via js after the dom is ready
[11:02:09] <hermanus> there are a lot of articles on it
[11:02:10] <v0lZy> I dont have a need for display: none in this case
[11:02:16] <v0lZy> Its just overflow:hidden
[11:02:18] <Anitox> he's just using overflow
[11:02:22] <Anitox> and no scrollbar
[11:02:24] <Anitox> should work
[11:02:24] <hermanus> oh ok,
[11:02:33] <hermanus> everything is fine then
[11:03:01] <Jayflux> last1 you still about?
[11:03:03] <v0lZy> I only ever use display none if im writting some javascript for pictures that work like radio buttons or something..
[11:03:10] <v0lZy> but in my current page, just overflow... ok
[11:03:27] <v0lZy> The reason why im doing this is because it makes the page into a single file.
[11:03:33] <m4xx> hermanus thanks, i think this just makes stuff more confusing =\
[11:03:45] <v0lZy> and its pretty easy to implement... except, theres 1 thing I have to do
[11:03:58] <v0lZy> I have to change the anchor in the URL
[11:04:03] <v0lZy> location.hash
[11:04:10] <v0lZy> is his problematic?
[11:05:20] <v0lZy> (basically, what i do is, after i scroll, i add a fake anchor to the end of the url, which i assocciate with a real anchor and then use a setInterval to check which anchor I have to display the right page... this allows for the back button to work (obviously, it doesnt scroll in that case).
[11:05:51] <Engin> creating a lot of img elements cause trouble in IE. any best practices ?
[11:05:54] <v0lZy> when i say page, i mean section of the overflowed text...
[11:05:58] <m4xx> "disabled" would be a property correct?

[11:06:20] <Engin> trouble as in the UI freezes, the amount of imgs I'm talking about is 165 in this case, but it can be a thousand too.
[11:07:07] <v0lZy> force them to load one after another Engin
[11:07:33] <v0lZy> after the page is loaded.
[11:07:40] <Engin> isn't by definition they are supposed to be loaded one after another as required by standards enforced on HTTP and browsers
[11:07:51] <hermanus> m4xx, yup but attr should still work for disabled
[11:07:57] <Engin> of course, this is happening after the docuemnt ready
[11:07:57] <v0lZy> *after* the page is loaded
[11:08:05] <Anitox> v01Zy: you know you dont need to use javascript to scroll that, right?
[11:08:22] <v0lZy> Anitox: I know it works without javascript
[11:08:29] <jqp> can someone explain why http://jsfiddle.net/HUfZs/ works differently from http://jsfiddle.net/d7vaH/?
[11:08:30] <v0lZy> Anitox: but it "jumps" rather than scrolls nicely
[11:08:47] <Anitox> yeah, it doesnt 'slowly scroll' down to it
[11:09:11] <v0lZy> Anitox: And the thing is, i have a 2 tier menu... first an entire viewport slides, and on the second tier, parts of the new viewport slide ...
[11:09:46] <jqp> both hook into the xhr's onreadystatechange event and append the current readyState to the document, but the jQuery 1.6.1 implementation only logs readyState of 1 while the native javascript implementation works as expected, logging readyState 3 and 4
[11:09:49] <Anitox> ahh, i usually just avoid using any of the animation stuff
[11:10:16] <ch3mical> I think I just had an epiphone
[11:10:18] <jqp> i guess my question is: why doesn't the jquery implementation log readyState 3 and 4, but the native javascript implementation does?
[11:10:40] <v0lZy> (if you can imagine, its like, a div thats 5000 px heigh, with several divs that are 500 px heigh, where the first div is set to overflow hidden and limited to 800px, and the other several divs are limited to say 200px and also overflow hidden
[11:10:51] <v0lZy> some anchors then scroll the large div, some anchors the small divs...
[11:11:19] <ch3mical> I've been wrestling with an issue with dataTables fnSetColumnVis for days now, and I think I just figured out why... I'm trying to set the column visible while the table is in a hidden jqUI tab
[11:11:28] <ch3mical> *pulls out hair*
[11:11:28] <m4xx> is there also an accompanying "removeProp" function?
[11:11:34] <v0lZy> In my case, I rather need this scrolling i think... well, Not really, but i think smooth pages encourage reading.
[11:11:56] <m4xx> guess so: http://api.jquery.com/removeProp/
[11:12:00] <m4xx> thanks =]
[11:12:06] <Anitox> i usually dislike too much flashy stuff in a website
[11:12:24] <Anitox> and i consider all the fade, scroll, animate stuff to be flashy
[11:12:25] <TonkaTruck> My homemade desk started to collapse...had to move huge imac!
[11:12:32] * TonkaTruck on floor.
[11:12:43] <v0lZy> If DHTML has one advantage, is that you dont have to worry about leaving the site or opening new tabs when you are interested in something mentioned but not quie finished with reading the article
[11:13:10] <Anitox> i dislike it when i cant bookmark the page to go back to it
[11:13:32] <Anitox> and then i have to navigate to the info, cause someone decided to implement it with flashy stuff
[11:14:01] <v0lZy> thats just bad implementation...
[11:14:07] <v0lZy> I have a solution for that... attaching those fake anchors
[11:14:19] <v0lZy> and then, when the document loads, scrolling to whatever the anchor name is.
[11:14:53] <v0lZy> hough im not sure if this is cross browser
[11:14:56] <Anitox> you can just do that without any javascript
[11:15:02] <Anitox> which is perfectly fine in my book
[11:15:21] <v0lZy> Actually, it cant be done without javascript i think
[11:15:25] <v0lZy> because its in more than 1 tier
[11:15:41] <Anitox> no, i mean using the #tags to link to a part of the page
[11:15:57] <Anitox> as long as you put those in your hidden divs, it'll open to it when the page opens
[11:15:58] <v0lZy> yeah, i know, you cant do it on more than 1 tier
[11:16:06] <v0lZy> because the browser shifts the entire page
[11:16:14] <v0lZy> not just the overflowed div.
[11:16:16] <Anitox> thats bad implementation
[11:16:35] <Jayflux> hey ajpiano you about
[11:16:42] <v0lZy> well,  the thing is
[11:16:51] <Jayflux> #jquery-meeting
[11:16:56] <v0lZy> if you put a <div><div></div></div> and have them both overflown
[11:17:11] <v0lZy> the browser, when focusing on the anchor of the inner div, will also scroll the outer one.
[11:17:36] <Anitox> ya, it should scroll them both, so the #tag is showing on the page to the user
[11:18:13] <bartek> Hi there. Given one object, I want to select all the inputs within that objects "grouping" (a div with a class wrapping them), except the element that I'm querying from. Right now I have $("#my_obj").parents("div.programs").find(":input"); but that also returns #my_obj. Any tips?
[11:18:29] <v0lZy> True, but it creates a problem when there are more links in the outter div for controlling the anchor of the inner divs
[11:18:30] <v0lZy> its like this
[11:18:35] <Anitox> #('#my_obj input')
[11:18:54] <Anitox> oops
[11:18:58] <Anitox> $('#my_obj input')
[11:18:58] <mattyh88> is there a way to stop a for while for a while and then let it continue again?
[11:19:00] <Jayflux> that won't work
[11:19:04] <mattyh88> *for loop
[11:19:11] <bartek> No, that won't work. #my_obj is an input. I want all the inputs EXCEPT it, within that class wrapping
[11:19:30] <diegoviola> <div class='box user_list'> -- i didn't knew classes could have empty spaces?
[11:19:33] <diegoviola> as their names
[11:19:38] <Anitox> is there a siblings match?
[11:19:39] <bartek> thats just two classes
[11:19:40] <Jayflux> can you not give it an id bartek?
[11:19:54] <v0lZy> <div><a href="#1"></a><a href="#2"></a><a href="#3"></a><div><div id="1"></div><div id="2"></div> ....</div></div>
[11:19:59] <bartek> Anitox: The ids are dynamic
[11:20:04] <bartek> Er, Jayflux ^
[11:20:17] <Jayflux> hmm
[11:20:22] <v0lZy> if it scrolls them both, the inner and the second tier div, the first div's links scroll away and you can no longer control the second tier divs :|
[11:20:23] <diegoviola> bartek: thanks
[11:20:51] <Anitox> v01Zy: perhaps it may be better to design it so there isnt a scrolling div inside a scrolling div ...
[11:21:36] <Jayflux> hmm would adding :not(this) on the end work bartek
[11:21:47] <Jayflux> .not*
[11:22:21] <v0lZy> Anitox: the alternative to that particular scenario i think is  well... there is none
[11:22:40] <v0lZy> the second tier navigation would have to be outside the outer div.
[11:22:44] <Anitox> bartek, JayFlux: .siblings()
[11:22:58] <Jayflux> yeah i was just about to say $(this).siblings()
[11:23:27] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: any idee why is not working http://jsfiddle.net/tMLGb/2/
[11:23:43] <SoulRaven> is changing only the first part, but the currency part is not
[11:23:54] <Jayflux> $(this).siblings().find.(":input") should work bartek
[11:24:02] <Jayflux> i think
[11:24:33] <Anitox> $('#my_obj').siblings();
[11:24:42] <last1> how do I call the parseJSON function ? is it jQuery.JSON or $.parseJSON ?
[11:24:42] <Anitox> will get all those inputs except the #my_objh
[11:24:47] <Jayflux> ^
[11:24:59] <Anitox> either works i believe
[11:30:17] <diegoviola> to update my current html with ajax html response, do i need to delete the current elements and append the elements form the response or is there a function that will update for me?
[11:30:24] <diegoviola> from*
[11:31:41] <last1> if I'm expecting JSON data for an .ajax request using dataType='json', if the success function is called, does it mean that the received data was properly formatted ?
[11:32:04] <jqp> last1: i don't believe so
[11:32:50] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[11:33:37] <freeed> anyone know of an image album plugin? something like gallerific but that can browse multiple galleries?
[11:35:05] <thm> is there a link to a complete css file?
[11:36:06] <coreyw> I'm trying to create a jquery object, then wrap it around another element. But its losing the reference to the wrapped element. My code basically is this: "base.wrap = $('<div class="wrap"></div>'); base.container.wrap(base.wrap);" and after that, base.wrap doesn't map correctly
[11:37:04] <thm> say, I want one complete css file for the base theme.
[11:40:47] <diegoviola> is there a jquery function to update HTML element with ajax html response rather than delete the element and inserting/appending it?
[11:40:55] <joikus> you guys,
[11:41:15] <joikus> what's the best jquery plugin to add an avatar uploader
[11:42:15] <Brodingo> diegoviola you could .load() something into a div and then use the callback to append it somewhere
[11:42:20] <JeffJassky_> Wondering if anyone knows of a way to use the Interface "Droppable" plugin the same way the JQuery UI / droppable plugin works. Particularly the "greedy" setting which eliminates propagation of nested droppable elements.
[11:43:33] <diegoviola> Brodingo: sure, but i still have the old content then
[11:43:41] <diegoviola> Brodingo: that i want it to go away, the old content
[11:44:06] <JeffJassky_> And yes, I'm fully aware that this is a "jquery core" channel and plugins as such are not "officially supported".
[11:44:12] <Brodingo> ok then .load() ?
[11:45:05] <diegoviola> let me check, thanks
[11:45:14] <Brodingo> ?load

[11:45:20] <fakingfantastic> Hey gang, little bit of a theoretical question: I want to make a LineItem object for an invoice system. When I create a new line form row with a $.append(), I want the hourly rate to default to a value in the current user's db table. Do you 1) ajax for that value on page load, 2) set up a global config, 3) Let the backend view (rails) set up the first value & clone it, 4) other/

[11:45:32] <Brodingo> diegoviola ^
[11:45:41] <Jayflux> sow hats the preferred way of using the success handler in .ajax now then? still using success: function({}); or .success() on the end?
[11:45:55] <SoulRaven> mysphyt: any idee why is not working http://jsfiddle.net/tMLGb/5/ , i want to select the title tag
[11:46:25] <diegoviola> Brodingo: i think that will do, thanks
[11:46:26] <diegoviola> testing now
[11:47:01] <fakingfantastic> SoulRaven: .catch doesn't have a title attr, the parent span does.
[11:48:09] <SoulRaven> fakingfantastic: i want to get the title from span_bankrate class
[11:48:14] <fakingfantastic> i got you
[11:48:32] <fakingfantastic> so $(this).parents("span.classname").attr("title)
[11:48:33] <SoulRaven> when i click the catch class, to get title of span_bankrate class
[11:48:44] <fakingfantastic> etc...
[11:49:59] <lastent> Hi, what would be the expression to find all the child nodes(input) inside a div of the type submit $("#mydiv:inout")?
[11:50:05] <SoulRaven> fakingfantastic: is working, thx
[11:50:10] <fakingfantastic> np
[11:50:56] <suspectedstyle> question... I am running an Ajax call, adding the data to a div element, and I would like to use jquery to mess with the new data... how do I do this without livequery???
[11:51:04] <suspectedstyle> for example - refresh the dom
[11:51:18] <suspectedstyle> or rather.... refresh the dom map
[11:51:47] <fakingfantastic> suspectedstyle: you can wrap the bind code in a method and recall it
[11:52:04] <fakingfantastic> suspectedstyle: use ajax's success call back to rebind
[11:52:56] <suspectedstyle> I am essentially running an ajax call from within an ajax call
[11:52:59] <suspectedstyle> not the prettiest
[11:53:17] <suspectedstyle> but they are doing different things based on the data contained in each
[11:53:30] <suspectedstyle> (as well as based on the data the user sets
[11:54:07] <djQuery> ?.grep
[11:54:08] <bot-t> jQuery.grep(array, function, [invert]): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[11:55:36] <suspectedstyle> that for me djQuery?
[11:55:55] <suspectedstyle> if so... I don't see how it is relevant.... ????
[11:56:23] <agib> does anyone know if there's a way to see if an element has a height of "auto?" height() always returns a number value...
[11:56:31] <agib> and same with css("height")
[11:58:11] <bluOxigen> ?.ready
[11:58:12] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[11:58:15] <Whirl3d> once I have loaded a script into the dom, I should be able to call the functions from that script from any other loaded script, correct?
[11:58:53] <djQuery> suspectedstyle: no it was for me
[11:59:06] <suspectedstyle> ahh, that threw me off
[11:59:07] <suspectedstyle> lol
[11:59:19] <Whirl3d> djQuery! What's up, man? How you doin' today?
[12:00:01] <last1> does this look like a proper success function for an .ajax call ? http://pastebin.com/mGEwdMm2
[12:00:28] <last1> I'm trying to decode the JSON content I receive from my script. xhr.responseText has the JSON data alright but I can't decode it
[12:00:53] <djQuery> Whirl3d: good, just trying to extend jquery.ui.autocomplete to support inputs that have a list defined in them   <input type="text" datalist="mylist" /> <datalist id="mylist"><option></option></datalist>
[12:01:24] <diegoviola> strange, .change() is working only once here... i click on my select element, it does the change() and then an ajax call, but whenever i do the change again it doesn't do the ajax call anymore, any ideas please?
[12:02:17] <agib> is there any way to tell if an explicit height is set on an element?
[12:05:13] <Whirl3d> djQuery, do you have a general use case for such a thing? Who knows, I might use it one day...but I don't see how it would work...enlighten me.
[12:06:01] <Whirl3d> djQuery, so you could select a group based on a list? I'm missing something but it sounds interesting...
[12:06:24] <abjorn> mfw im writing and compiling c code in a browser. damn this jslinux thing is cool
[12:06:50] <suspectedstyle> didn't help :/
[12:07:00] <Whirl3d> agib, you might be able to use naturalWidth property?
[12:07:03] <suspectedstyle> I am essentially trying to run something similar to .live() without an event
[12:07:38] <suspectedstyle> so it will run $("#fill").html(data); on the dom as it is
[12:07:45] <agib> Whirl3d: oh, didn't see that in the api
[12:07:46] <Brodingo> ?G jquery live jquery
[12:07:47] <suspectedstyle> all of this is done automatically, so there are no actions to bind
[12:07:47] <bot-t> Brodingo, .live()  jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/live/
[12:07:54] <Whirl3d> if ($(elem)[0].naturalWidth!=$(elem).width()) { //width has been applied    --don't know if it'll work, but it's worth a try
[12:07:59] <Brodingo> ?g livequery plugin
[12:08:00] <bot-t> Brodingo, Live Query | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/livequery
[12:08:19] <suspectedstyle> as I said up above, trying to do it without livequery
[12:08:29] <Brodingo> oh i didnt read
[12:08:39] <Whirl3d> Anybody know if you can attach a "load" handler to a script element to be added to the dom?
[12:09:04] <suspectedstyle> I remember there being something (possibly deprecated) you could use in jQuery to force-refresh the dom
[12:09:08] <suspectedstyle> dom-map * rather
[12:09:32] <jonclark> Whirl3d: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[12:09:32] <suspectedstyle> been years since I had to use it, so it might not be around anymore
[12:10:04] <jonclark> i would advise against using livequery anymore
[12:10:19] <jonclark> callbacks are the answer
[12:10:56] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[12:10:59] <suspectedstyle> jonclark: would be awesome, but how am I supposed to do that if the elements I am aiming for aren't registered in the dom-map?
[12:11:14] <suspectedstyle> at least... as far as jquery is concerned
[12:11:36] <jonclark> so you want to act on stuff that has been loaded in after an ajax call?
[12:11:40] <BlaDe^> I have: .insertAfter($data.find("tr.active").last()); ------  if tr.active doesn't exist, can I use "tr.inactive" ?
[12:11:44] <suspectedstyle> indeed
[12:11:55] <jonclark> and no events will work?
[12:11:57] <suspectedstyle> in* an ajax call
[12:12:08] <jonclark> and you don't want to do it the success callback?
[12:12:18] <jonclark> got a fiddle?
[12:12:22] <jonclark> (jsfiddle)
[12:13:27] <suspectedstyle> wouldn't be easy to transfer to a fiddle
[12:13:40] <jonclark> where's it at then?
[12:13:56] <suspectedstyle> it is dependent on the hash value in the address bar
[12:14:13] <suspectedstyle> there are a few (nested) ajax calls based on what is being done
[12:14:19] <suspectedstyle> most of the content is fine.......
[12:14:34] <suspectedstyle> but there is one div that is generated through the ajax call
[12:14:47] <suspectedstyle> 1 sec
[12:15:05] <BlaDe^> any ideas guys?
[12:15:55] <jonclark> so you wanna insert after tr.active but if there is none, insert after tr.inactive?
[12:16:59] <BlaDe^> yup jonclark :-) in mysql there's COALESCE -- is there something similar?
[12:18:20] <suspectedstyle> jonclark: http://pastebin.com/m8PWRj7C
[12:18:47] <suspectedstyle> the layout in the top sucks... check out the bottom
[12:18:56] <jonclark> BlaDe^: tableRow = $data.find("tr.active").length ? 'tr.active' : 'tr.inactive';
[12:18:57] <suspectedstyle> (too many tabs for pastebin to be useful)
[12:19:00] <jonclark> then do
[12:19:10] <jonclark> .insertAfter($data.find(tableRow).last());
[12:19:16] <jonclark> maybe not the most elegant
[12:20:08] <BlaDe^> ok thanks jonclark :-)
[12:20:40] <suspectedstyle> ignore the document reset nonesense... just realized that was still in there
[12:20:50] <suspectedstyle> just playing around.. there was nothing there
[12:20:59] <suspectedstyle> (obviously didnt work)
[12:21:19] <diegoviola> guys, any ideas why this is working only once: https://gist.github.com/977166 -- it does the change/ajax call but whenever i change my options in the select element it doesn't work anymore, any ideas?
[12:21:44] <diegoviola> whenever i try to trigger it again
[12:21:47] <djQuery> Whirl3d: here ya go http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/4yBCR/
[12:21:54] <djQuery> still working on the plugin version.
[12:21:56] <diegoviola> until i reload the entire page
[12:21:57] <Whirl3d> jonclark, thanks for the reply. Is that better than adding the script to the head by manually inserting it through javascript? I found out you can assign a load handler...
[12:22:11] <JordiGH> So, maybe it's a deformation from using Prototype, but if I want to create a DOM element, I was expecting jQuery to have some sort of var foo = $("#place").create("div", {attr_name : attr_value}), but that doesn't seem to exist. Should I just write the HTML and then use $() to fetch that DOM element?
[12:22:13] <Whirl3d> djQuery, checkin it out now...
[12:22:22] <djQuery> Whirl3d: ?yepnope
[12:22:29] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[12:22:49] <jonclark> diegoviola: maybe .live('change',function() { would work
[12:22:58] <jonclark> instead of .change(function() {
[12:23:42] <jonclark> JordiGH: just do $("<div />").attr("name","mydiv").appendTo("#somewhere");
[12:23:56] <TeddyMurray> if i do $(".slot #yag10") will i select an element with class slot and id yag10?
[12:24:03] <Whirl3d> djQuery, cool, but if you type A it lists all items with an A in them. Is that expected?
[12:24:04] <jonclark> once you create the first object, $("<div />"), you can keep chaining things to it
[12:24:18] <djQuery> yes
[12:24:23] <TeddyMurray> to me?
[12:24:24] <jonclark> TeddyMurray: you need to remove the space, what you have there will look for children of .slot
[12:24:35] <TeddyMurray> .slot#yag10
[12:24:36] <TeddyMurray> like that?
[12:24:37] <jonclark> TeddyMurray: you want $(".slot#yag10")
[12:24:40] <TeddyMurray> nice
[12:24:43] <TeddyMurray> jquery is awesome
[12:24:43] <JordiGH> jonclark: Thanks.
[12:24:48] <djQuery> will be adding the ability define the filter and have it to where it starts with instead
[12:25:00] <jonclark> TeddyMurray: to be fair that's just css :P
[12:25:05] <Whirl3d> djQuery, I could see where that is useful. Does the regular jquery offer a popup list?
[12:25:10] <jonclark> or selector engine..whatever :x
[12:25:17] <Whirl3d> *jqueryUI
[12:25:23] <jonclark> i'm sorry suspectedstyle this shit is way confusing lol
[12:25:24] <djQuery> Whirl3d: no just jwuery ui
[12:25:26] <JordiGH> lol
[12:25:32] <suspectedstyle> lol, it is
[12:25:37] <JordiGH> lol
[12:25:48] <Whirl3d> djQuery, perhaps you could highlight the matches too...
[12:25:50] <JordiGH> 3-lol combo! Good!
[12:25:58] <JordiGH> Uh.
[12:26:02] * JordiGH exeunt left
[12:26:08] <djQuery> TeddyMurray: $('#yag10.slot') would be faster
[12:26:23] <jqp> any help with this question would be appreciated: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6035987/can-i-use-jquery-prefilters-to-detect-onreadystatechange-events-where-readystate
[12:26:30] <diegoviola> jonclark: nice, that did it, thanks! :)

[12:26:58] <swiggy> if i have abunch of checkboxes, that are disabled - but on form submit time, i want them to be enabled (so that data values are posted) -- would something like this work??:               $('input[type="checkbox"]').is(':disabled').attr('disabled',false);
[12:27:33] <jonclark> swiggy, yea it would, but instead of .attr('disabled',false) try .removeAttr('disabled')
[12:27:36] <swiggy> a disabled checkbox does not post to the server, but my script is pre-selecting some checkboxes
[12:27:45] <swiggy> ok thanks
[12:27:52] <jonclark> you're on the right track tho :)
[12:28:35] <suspectedstyle> oh shit
[12:28:38] <suspectedstyle> t.t
[12:28:42] <suspectedstyle> disregard everything
[12:28:45] <suspectedstyle> I am an idiot
[12:28:47] <suspectedstyle> it did work
[12:29:05] <suspectedstyle> as much as I would like it to be the case when I mix them up... class ≠ id
[12:29:25] <jonclark> haha
[12:31:05] <Whirl3d> djQuery, is the popuplist html?
[12:31:18] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: how's it going?
[12:31:45] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, Good thanks, and you?
[12:32:02] <SoulRaven> give me a ideea, how i check is a variabile is changed, but repeatly, in constant interval
[12:32:10] <SoulRaven> give me a ideea, how i check if a variabile is changed, but repeatly, in constant interval
[12:32:19] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: good. I finally solved my issue with the table plugin I've been using (dataTables), so I'm happy.
[12:32:21] <abjorn> http://coreymedia.com/2011/05/speed-is-not-as-important-as-you-think-it-is/
[12:32:52] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, right on. what was the issue?
[12:34:24] <lastent> Hi, what would be the expression to find all the child nodes(input) inside a div of the type submit $("#mydiv:inout")?
[12:35:09] <Whirl3d> djQuery, how is the popup list rendered? I added a line to highlight the search term and it shows up as plain text (ugggllly)
[12:35:20] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: it was a "DOM Exception 8" ... finally figured out it was because I was trying to interact with something that wasn't in the DOM, because it was in another jqUI Tab, which means it's not in the DOM when not the active tab
[12:35:50] <swiggy> $('input[type="checkbox"]').is(':disabled').removeAttr('disabled');     did not work
[12:36:04] <swiggy> i am still not getting data from my checkboxes on POST
[12:36:15] <gnarf> swiggy: what version of jQuery?
[12:36:20] <swiggy> 1.4.2
[12:36:21] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, so jqUI detatches the elements when not active?
[12:36:42] <jonclark> swiggy, are you doing it inside your $(
[12:36:47] <jonclark> sorry sneezed..
[12:36:51] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: it uses display: none, which means they are not in the DOM
[12:36:57] <Whirl3d> jonclark: blessyou
[12:36:57] <jonclark> inside your $('form').submit(function() { ... }); ?
[12:36:59] <ch3mical> If I'm not mistaken
[12:37:31] <ch3mical> swiggy: if you are trying to remove disabled attr, it's better to just set it to false
[12:37:34] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, did not know that. I assumed that display:none kept the item in the dom...good to know
[12:37:36] <swiggy> jonclark,  this is a form validation, it goes threw a form validation function and if everything passses -> }else{ $('input[type="checkbox"]').is(':disabled').removeAttr('disabled');   return true; }
[12:37:53] <lastent> Hi, what would be the expression to find all the child nodes(input) inside a div of the type submit $("#mydiv:inout")?
[12:37:56] <swiggy> .attr('disabled',false);  ??
[12:38:00] <jonclark> my bad ch3mical, i suggested otherwise
[12:38:03] <jonclark> he had that originally :x
[12:38:10] <ch3mical> swiggy: yes
[12:38:28] <swiggy> is my selector correct, or should it be $('input[type="checkbox"]:disabled')
[12:38:32] <swiggy> instead of .is
[12:38:34] <Whirl3d> djQuery, you still there man?
[12:38:38] <ch3mical> However if your problem is that you can't get the value of it, disabled shouldn't prevent getting .val()
[12:38:43] <jonclark> oooo.. .is will return boolean
[12:38:47] <jonclark> you probably want .filter
[12:38:50] <swiggy> im not trying to get the value
[12:39:03] <swiggy> i want the data to post to the server from the disabled checkboxes
[12:39:04] <ch3mical> swiggy: either way
[12:39:05] <rns> anyone know how I can not hide all of my tab contents when I click on a new tab (I only want to change the tab on the form being clicked)?  http://dpaste.com/543460/
[12:39:19] <swiggy> .filter(':disabled') ?
[12:39:37] <jonclark> yeah give that a shot
[12:39:48] <jonclark> once you hit .is, it returns a boolean
[12:39:52] <jonclark> so your chain would end there
[12:40:23] <swiggy> right thats what i thought
[12:40:32] <swiggy> so use .filter?
[12:40:48] <ch3mical> swiggy: you just want the value of all disabled checkboxes?
[12:40:51] <swiggy> isnt $('input[type="checkbox"]:disabled') the same as .filter?
[12:40:55] <swiggy> no ch3m
[12:40:59] <swiggy> i do not want the values.
[12:41:04] <ch3mical> swiggy: oh sorry
[12:41:07] <maxdlx> swiggy: filter() would work, i guess. you can also take a look at the "readonly" attribute for your checkboxes. <input readonly="true" ... /> will be submitted, but you have to style it like "disabled" elements.
[12:41:08] <swiggy> i want the checkboxes values to post to the server
[12:41:13] <swiggy> a disabled checkbox does not post
[12:41:44] <bcardarella> do ':'s represent anything for custom events? Or are they just a convention of separating words for the custom event name?
[12:42:03] <Whirl3d> anybody know of a more graceful way to handle this: I have a master script that needs functions from several other scripts so it loads them dynamically. The problem is that it contnues to call one of the functions from a loading script before it's loaded. I tried this to solve the issue, but it didn't help: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/rHyPD/
[12:42:42] <jonclark> whirl3d, i think djQuery suggested something great earlier
[12:42:47] <jonclark> ?yepnope
[12:42:48] <bot-t> yepnope is an asynchronous conditional resource loader that's super-fast, and allows you to load only the scripts that your users need: http://yepnopejs.com/
[12:42:51] <ch3mical> swiggy: So do something like var disabledBoxes = $('input[type="checkbox"]:disabled'); disabledBoxes.attr('disabled',false); (post code here); disabledBoxes.attr('disabled',true);
[12:43:16] <maxdlx> bcardarella: you can write your own selectors, or custom selectors. the syntax is borrowed from css3, i think. http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#enableddisabled
[12:43:21] <Whirl3d> lol, jonclark, thanks. I thought he was asking if I liked his script. LOL
[12:43:22] <jqp> Whril3d: have you tried loading the scripting one after the other, using something like a nested callback?
[12:43:34] <jqp> loading the scripts*
[12:43:35] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: are they your scripts (can you edit them all)?
[12:44:10] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, yes they are all mine and that's a great idea...they could do something on load to let me know they loaded correctly...
[12:44:25] <bcardarella> maxdlx: so what would be the difference between that and the '.' namespacing?
[12:44:45] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: yeah, create a callback function in the main script and call it at the end of each loading script (maybe pass a value, as needed)?
[12:44:45] <Whirl3d> jqp, yes, I am trying that now and I used a load handler to keep track of it all, but it still didn't work...
[12:45:25] <swiggy> i am not posting via ajax?
[12:45:30] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, so simple. I knew you'd have the answer. Thanks.
[12:45:35] <maxdlx> bcardarella: "." is for classes. class names are given via class="blah blah" - they are not dynamic, unless you script them!
[12:45:36] <ch3mical> lol
[12:45:42] <swiggy> i just need it to disable the checkbox before the form posts, thats all
[12:46:41] <bcardarella> maxdlx: I'm talking about custom event names. So for example $('whatever').live('form:something') vs $('whatever').live('form.something')
[12:46:48] <maxdlx> bcardarella: if somebody checks a checkbox, the selector ':checked' matches. no more scripting required.
[12:47:25] <ccmonster> hey guys, i have multiple object literals in my one script and i want to access  values from one inside another.  ie. searcher.config.thisparam : parameters.searchParam,
[12:47:30] <ccmonster> however its not letting me
[12:47:36] <maxdlx> bcardarella: i don't know. for me it sounds quite familiar to changing element class names.
[12:48:12] <ch3mical> swiggy: not sure what to tell you. As far as I knew you could still get the values of (and submit them) disabled checkboxes
[12:48:26] <atula> strevat: yoh. around ?
[12:48:44] <maxdlx> bcardarella: unless somebody provides a plugin for, let's say, 'form:submitted' - you no longer interefere with user namespaces.
[12:48:54] <ch3mical> swiggy: if you're just relying on the form action attribute to submit the form, you may need to switch to an AJAX POST
[12:49:18] <bcardarella> maxdlx: thanks
[12:49:53] <maxdlx> bcardarella: seems like an interesting topic. haven't got any deeper into that, yet. ;-) thank you
[12:51:41] <sphinxxxx> hey was wondering what's the simpliest jquery plugin to use for this kind of functionality: i just have a few links, and i want a div to appear on hover (for eacho ne respectively)

[12:52:58] <ccmonster> anyone?
[12:54:10] <pifantastic> ?p @ ccmonster
[12:54:10] <bot-t> ccmonster, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[12:55:43] <swiggy> LOL
[12:55:48] <swiggy> i figured it out
[12:55:51] * swiggy is a dumbo
[12:56:01] <swiggy> i had the checkbox disable thing
[12:56:05] <swiggy> in the wrong validation
[12:56:08] <swiggy> tthats why it wasnt working
[12:56:09] <ch3mical> :)
[12:56:12] <swiggy> durp durp durppppp
[12:56:21] <ch3mical> Glad you got it working
[12:57:31] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/1918069 error on line 50 - says parameters.data is not defined.
[12:58:33] <ch3mical> ccmonster: because it's not defined....  <__<  >__>
[12:59:06] <rns> anyone know how I can not hide all of my tab contents when I click on a new tab (I only want to change the tab on the form being clicked)?  http://dpaste.com/543460/
[12:59:37] <ccmonster> lol ch3mical , but im running the init, and defining it. It works within the scope of parameters,
[12:59:46] <ccmonster> i know their is data.
[13:02:43] <maxdlx> ccmonster: init() is called 'onload', but not before declaration of your 'searcher' object.
[13:03:52] <ccmonster> so even though i have parameter.init() triggered first, searcher.init() is occuring first
[13:04:07] <pifantastic> ccmonster: parameters.data.query <- I never see that set
[13:04:25] <pifantastic> Are you sure this line is doing what you think it is doing? parameters.data = jQuery.deparam.querystring();
[13:04:31] <ch3mical> Hurray for race conditions!
[13:04:44] <maxdlx> ccmonster: no, parameters.init() and searcher.init() happen in a callback. the rest of the script does not. maybe you should make everything in the callback.
[13:05:01] <ccmonster> so how do i do that again?
[13:05:14] <ch3mical> Do we have a thing in the bot for race conditions?

[13:05:42] <ch3mical> Argh
[13:07:56] <maxdlx> one way would be to do this: http://pastie.org/1918130 @ccmonster
[13:08:24] <ch3mical> ccmonster: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/timing-and-synchronization-in-javascript/
[13:08:27] <maxdlx> the 'myApp' is there to provide some namespacing.
[13:10:54] <rns> can anyone help me with tabbed forms?  This code keeps displaying contents of all tabs whenever a tab is clicked instead of only the contents of the active tab.  http://dpaste.com/543460/
[13:15:08] <djQuery> Whirl3d: have you looked at see ?yepnope
[13:15:08] <bot-t> Whirl3d, yepnope is an asynchronous conditional resource loader that's super-fast, and allows you to load only the scripts that your users need: http://yepnopejs.com/
[13:16:25] <Jayflux> rns what does your active class do. you have a live example of this?
[13:16:28] <Jayflux> or link
[13:18:03] <dabbish> I have a standard form. How can I execute jquery code after I have submitted it?
[13:18:21] <Jayflux> i think maybe you need a $('li').each('') on your click event
[13:18:34] <Jayflux> dabbish .submit();
[13:18:37] <rns> Jayflux, no live example.  Is there a site that will display jquery code live?
[13:18:45] <Jayflux> ?submit() @ dabbish
[13:18:46] <maxdlx> rns: it's hard to spot an error in the code you've posted. what's bugging me is the 'for' loop around the template and some hardcoded id's in your <a href="">'s
[13:18:46] <bot-t> dabbish, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[13:19:12] <dabbish> thanks guys, i'll check it out
[13:20:02] <rns> maxdlx, yeah, it's the for loop that seems to be causing the trouble.  But unfortunately it has to stay
[13:21:39] <rns> Jayflux, here's the code with the active class http://dpaste.com/543557/
[13:22:01] <maxdlx> rns, well then.. could you try sth. like "tenant_tab-{{ forloop.counter }}" instead of "tenant_tab{{ forloop.counter }}-1" ?
[13:22:24] <maxdlx> don't forget to replace all occurences in the code
[13:22:34] <maxdlx> maybe it helps ;-)
[13:22:46] <Jayflux> ^
[13:23:24] <rns> maxdlx, had to do -1 and -2 because otherwise the loop would repeat numbers on each iteration
[13:23:38] <maxdlx> rns: sry, skip that. doesn't seem to help anyhow...
[13:25:22] <rns> maxdlx, how can I store the oldTab similar to how I am storing the activeTab variable?  For var activeTab I am using $(this) - but I can't do that for the oldTab can I?
[13:27:34] <maxdlx> rns: not sure i can follow, but isn't the 'oldTab' the one with the current 'active' class?
[13:28:05] <maxdlx> of course you have to store it before calling .removeClass("active")
[13:29:45] <last1> I have a page that runs beautifully in ff4 & chrome but not at all in IE8. where do I even begin to debug this ?
[13:29:55] <maxdlx> rns, $("ul.tenant_tabs li").is(".active").hide().removeClass("active") could take you somewhere...
[13:29:58] <orolo> last1
[13:30:05] <orolo> do you have any 'console.logs' in there?
[13:30:11] <maxdlx> f12
[13:30:47] <maxdlx> html, css, scripting, console... works great for me, debugging ie
[13:30:52] <orolo> last1: also, maybe look at "firebug light" for ie8.
[13:30:55] <last1> yep, I pressed f12 to get in the developper tools. I see no errors anywhere
[13:30:58] <rns> maxdlx, the oldTab is the tab that is active before I click on a new tab.  I because I have several forms I making them all active - including the one I am clicking on - so I think I need to manually hide the previously active form so only one displays, and then still show all the other forms.  make sense?
[13:32:00] <last1> I have a jquery .ajax even triggered by a form submit. triggers just fine in ff/chrome but in IE I get nothing
[13:32:08] <last1> no errors, no yellow triangles, etc
[13:32:13] <last1> even -> event
[13:32:36] <dabbish> I can't get my form to execute jquery code after submit: http://jsfiddle.net/7g8MP/1/
[13:33:12] <dabbish> the alert does not happen, but the form submits fine
[13:33:34] <maxdlx> the form submission should happen at the end of the callback
[13:34:46] <maxdlx> look like an endless recursion, though ;-)
[13:35:13] <maxdlx> skip the line "$('#livedealer').submit();", do you alert(); and then return true;
[13:35:25] <maxdlx> rns: did you try $("ul.tenant_tabs li").is(".active").hide().removeClass("active") ?
[13:36:22] <maxdlx> dabbish: so it essentially looks like this > http://jsfiddle.net/7g8MP/3/
[13:37:36] <last1> found my error to be part of jquery. it says 'No Transport'
[13:38:37] <dabbish> maxdlx, thanks that works. but I actually need to close a the popup where the form is in. is that possible?
[13:40:21] <n20> Helo worldD!
[13:40:23] <maxdlx> dabbish: how about ".submit(); window.close();" that should work if the popup is in the current window.
[13:40:29] <rns> maxdlx, I tried this and it stopped displaying both tabs at the same time, but now it keeps displaying the first tab even if I click on the second.  http://dpaste.com/543567/
[13:40:34] <maxdlx> hellp n20
[13:40:44] <rns> maxdlx, we are getting closer though!
[13:41:16] <dabbish> maxdlx, Sorry to be unspecific. But it's actually an iframe called fancybox. That I close with parent.$.fancybox.close();
[13:43:05] <maxdlx> dabbish: so, what's the exact error in firebug/(error) console/f12 ? does the parent.$.fancybox.close() statement work after submit() ? are different (website)domains involded ?
[13:44:25] <maxdlx> rns: the first tab is always shown ? $('.tenant_tab_content[id$="1t"]').show(); //Show first tab content on all forms
[13:45:06] <last1> wow this is retarded
[13:45:09] <maxdlx> rns: you are doing this in the callback aswell. maybe it's a dulicate. there's a semicolon missing in line 74 aswell. don't know about that.
[13:45:31] <last1> so basically my script runs fine in FF & Chrome but not in IE8+ because of Cross-Domain requests. I have to re-write my script for IE now
[13:46:27] <glupek> How can I load a new page in the background, without reloading current one. I know I should use ".load()". Should I do "$("html").load()" ?
[13:46:35] <diegoviola> https://gist.github.com/977354 -- how to improve/refactor this code please?
[13:47:07] <rns> maxdlx, yes I want the first tab to display by default for all forms - except the form whos tab is being changed
[13:47:36] <rns> maxdlx, I fixed the missing ; but still getting the same behavior.
[13:48:37] <maxdlx> rns: take a look at line 71 in your snippet, that's a duplicate of line 65 and maybe causing the error
[13:50:10] <rns> maxdlx, If I take that line out then all the tab contents collapse for all forms - I added that so they would all stay visible on the page
[13:50:33] <maxdlx> last1: that sucks! maybe you can use an "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" header in your .htaccess file ? not sure about IE8, though.
[13:51:22] <maxdlx> rns: commenting it out => only one tab at a time is displayed ?!
[13:51:49] <dabbish> maxdlx, Nothing works after submit(), not even alert(). The form submits to another domain. But I am thinking it's that I can't execute code after submit, nor can I execute code after I close the iframe. Catch 22
[13:51:54] <diegoviola> is there a shortcut to this please:  $("html").find(".user_list").empty(); $(data).find(".user_list").appendTo(".user_list");
[13:51:58] <orolo> diegoviola: $(data).find(".user_list").html(".user_list");
[13:52:11] <orolo> diegoviola: oops.
[13:52:21] <snover> dabbish: you are obviously not actually attaching yourself to the form’s submit handler then
[13:52:58] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[13:53:08] <orolo> diegoviola: $(data).find(".user_list).appendTo(".user_list")
[13:53:21] <rns> maxdlx, it works fine if there is only one tabbed form on the page, but since I am displaying several forms with a for loop all the other forms collapse
[13:53:22] <glupek> Is it possible to load the whole page (head and body) using ".load()" ?
[13:53:40] <dabbish> snover: http://jsfiddle.net/7g8MP/1/
[13:53:45] <orolo> diegoviola: i don't get the $(data) part; are you trying to find the user_list class in your return?
[13:53:56] <diegoviola> orolo: will that do a empty() also if i have a .user_list?
[13:54:09] <orolo> yeah; .html("") will replace whats in there.
[13:54:16] <diegoviola> thanks
[13:54:17] <snover> dabbish: first of all, you need to wait until the dom is ready before you try to attach to things
[13:54:47] <snover> second of all, you are creating an infinite loop of submit event triggers
[13:55:02] <snover> you will never get past the first line of your submit handler because it keeps re-invoking itself
[13:55:28] <snover> a submit *event* is not the same thing as a form’s submit *function*
[13:55:56] <trevatwork> I know that using live(), I can bind events to elements that are loaded into the DOM by an AJAX response.  How can I do something similar w/ calls to button()?
[13:56:18] <maxdlx> dabbish: don't call submit() in the submit() handler. just 'return true;' at the end of the function. maybe do a setTimeout(window.close, 500); before the return statement!
[13:57:22] <maxdlx> rns: try replacing LINE 71 with $(this).find('.tenant_tab_content[id$="1t"]').show(); //Show first tab content on all forms
[13:57:25] <snover> maxdlx: you don’t have to return anything
[13:57:49] <diegoviola> orolo: this is not clearing, just adding to my current .user_list
[13:57:57] <benji_> Is there a synchronous equivalent to  $.ajax ?
[13:58:01] <orolo> diegoviola: yeah, i was just reading that.
[13:58:07] <maxdlx> true
[13:58:10] <diegoviola> orolo: i just removed the clear() line but it's not clearing...
[13:58:45] <diegoviola> so how to make this shorter?  $("html").find(".user_list").empty(); $(data).find(".user_list").appendTo(".user_list");
[13:59:08] <benji_> (got it)
[13:59:16] <orolo> diegoviola: 	http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[13:59:27] <orolo> diegoviola: possibly that ^^.
[13:59:28] <maxdlx> diegoviola: $(".user_list").html($(data).find(".user_list).html()); not very elegant but it should do the trick...
[13:59:29] <airstrike> ok, so binding an input to .blur() only gives me results when the user *focuses out* of the field after deleting it. how can i bind an event so that i call a function when the field is cleared while still in focus?
[13:59:55] <diegoviola> empty() is removing the .user_list childs, and then adding the ajax response user_list to my current html user_list
[13:59:58] <nickelnick> question for you guys regarding jquery mobile. i'm looking at a file select input on an andriod and a iphone....the andriod lets me push select and asks me what file. the iphone has the select button disbled as it appears. I have tried setting disabled="false" as well....but the iphone still does not let me choose a file. any hints why ?
[14:00:04] <diegoviola> orolo: thanks
[14:00:06] <diegoviola> maxdlx: thanks
[14:01:01] <maxdlx> nickelnick: afaik the iphone doesn't let you randomly upload files. android users have open access to their files whereas iphone users are stuck with itunes ;)
[14:01:13] <johnGadlol> Question:: Why the hell there is not a callback function for html() ??????????????????????
[14:01:16] <johnGadlol> Question:: Why the hell there is not a callback function for html() ??????????????????????
[14:01:18] <johnGadlol> Question:: Why the hell there is not a callback function for html() ??????????????????????
[14:01:43] <airstrike> question, why do you repeat yourself?
[14:01:52] * Demia blocks spammer johnGadlol who asks an idiotic question over and over.
[14:01:52] <orolo> diegoviola: weird: http://api.jquery.com/html#html2 .html() SHOULD work.
[14:01:54] <diegoviola> johnGadlol: chill
[14:01:58] <johnGadlol> because i am very pissed off
[14:02:05] <orolo> diegoviola: "When .html() is used to set an element's content, any content that was in that element is completely replaced by the new content. Consider the following HTML:"
[14:02:21] <ch3mical> johnGadlol: because it's not meant for that.. use .ajax() instead
[14:02:34] <ch3mical> Or extend it yourself
[14:02:36] <ch3mical> ;)
[14:02:55] <diegoviola> orolo: weird, maybe some issue with my html
[14:02:57] <orolo> johnGadlol: i think there is: http://api.jquery.com/html#html2
[14:03:16] <johnGadlol> i want a way to know when the contenct has change so i can for example re calculate the height of an element
[14:03:20] <nickelnick> maxdlx, seriously? that is the most lame shit ive ever heard
[14:03:30] <ch3mical> orolo: that's not a callback
[14:03:34] <orolo> johnGadlol: oh.
[14:03:59] <johnGadlol> how to do that?
[14:04:13] <orolo> johnGadlol: can you track any events? how is the html being changed?
[14:04:16] <rns> maxdlx, that hid all the forms again
[14:04:42] <johnGadlol> i change on the fly by calling a function.
[14:04:46] <JeffJassky_> Hey, guys. Is there a specific jQuery UI channel?
[14:04:51] <maxdlx> nickelnick: you can't access your filesystem/downloads/whatever from your iphone directly. that's why i don't use one...
[14:04:57] <orolo> johnGadlol: ok. then fire a callback in your function, right?
[14:05:02] <ch3mical> johnGadlol: just chain another function
[14:05:08] <maxdlx> nickelnick: sorry.
[14:05:17] <ch3mical> johnGadlol: blah.html(stuff).width(whatever);
[14:05:21] <diegoviola> $.get() is a shortcut for $.ajax()?
[14:05:42] <ch3mical> diegoviola: yes
[14:05:46] <orolo> ?.ajax() @diegoviola
[14:05:47] <bot-t> diegoviola, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:05:50] <diegoviola> nice
[14:05:53] <orolo> diegoviola: yeah.
[14:06:05] <diegoviola> so i suppose there is $.post() also :)
[14:06:11] <tmcw> Is there a strong reason why $.offset() doesn't support margins on the html element?
[14:06:15] <systemfault>  I still wonder why these shortcuts exists.. :/ A single function would be fine imho :P
[14:06:17] <johnGadlol> chaining means that if a functions has finished then start the other?
[14:06:18] <systemfault> </troll>
[14:06:36] <orolo> ?jQuery.post() @ diegoviola correct.
[14:06:38] <bot-t> orolo, Riding Rails: jQuery: New Default - http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/4/21/jquery-new-default
[14:06:45] <orolo> haha. thanks bot-t
[14:06:49] <maxdlx> rns: my fault! try this statement instead, please: $(this).closest('.tenant_tab_container').find('.tenant_tab_content[id$="1t"]').show();
[14:07:07] <Triluch> systemfault: and where is the opening tag? ;<
[14:07:12] <maxdlx> rns: the previous version did not match anything, that's why your tabs stayed hidden.
[14:07:16] <ch3mical> systemfault: because then you have a function that assumes the ajax is a get or post without having to specify that or modify the globals
[14:07:24] <ch3mical> systemfault: hence "short cut"
[14:07:42] <maxdlx> rns: this one tries to find a parent container and hides the first .tenant_tab_content div in there.
[14:07:42] <JeffJassky_> With the UI droppable plugin there are "over". "out" and "drop" events. But no callbacks to allow for validation of these events? for example, I want to NOT trigger an "over" event if the particular situation is invalid..
[14:08:45] <ch3mical> systemfault: any good programmer knows that if there's something you know you will do over and over, reuse your code (i.e. functions, shortcuts, etc) instead of writing it out a dozen times
[14:09:37] <orolo> JeffJassky_: i think you'd have to call the disable method().
[14:09:52] <rns> maxdlx, that one seems to collapse them all too
[14:10:02] <JeffJassky_> orolo: to disable specific elements? I suppose that makes sense. A bit of a pain but that works.
[14:10:04] <ch3mical> So at some point someone noticed that people were doing things like writing their own functions to "short cut" the .ajax() function, so they made it a feature of jquery to save people the trouble
[14:10:23] <orolo> JeffJassky_: yeah; that's only one way of doing it.
[14:10:44] <orolo> JeffJassky_: i can't think of another way to disable just the "over" event.
[14:10:53] <johnGadlol> can i define my own function after $('#dataholder').html(); example:: $('#dataholder').html().myfunction(variable1, variable2); , where function is a normal javascript function:: function myfunction(var1, var2){ do some stuff } ????????
[14:11:03] <JeffJassky_> orolo: There's also the 'scope' option which I could try dynamically adding a scope class to the correct elements..
[14:11:32] <orolo> JeffJassky_: nice.
[14:11:52] <systemfault> ch3mical: Imho, a general purpose library shouldn't try to fill all needs. Give general utilities then.. if people want more specific things, they'll write it themselve.
[14:11:57] <ch3mical> JeffJassky_: you could programmatically prevent the "over" based on some arbitrary value (a variable, a CSS class, an attached .data() value, etc)
[14:12:38] <ch3mical> systemfault: they aren't filling "all needs" just those that are very widely used
[14:13:02] <ch3mical> systemfault: .get() and .post(), et al, are general utilities in jquery
[14:13:26] <systemfault> They could have just used .ajax.
[14:14:30] <ajpiano> johnGadlol http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[14:14:56] <ch3mical> systemfault: sure, but then people are just going to write workarounds, like functions of their own to shortcut .ajax(), so it makes more sense to have it as a function in jquery which will save on overhead
[14:15:11] <ajpiano> JeffJassky_, wouldn't it make more sense for like, you to just use those event handlers, check a condition, and if so, fire the thing you want to do
[14:15:29] <JeffJassky_> ajpiano: I see what you're saying.. hmm
[14:15:33] <ajpiano> as opposed to buildling some layer ontop that just triggers a bunch of callbacks that supress the other callbacks from firing
[14:15:37] <JeffJassky_> ajpiano: That's a possibility as well then.
[14:15:46] <systemfault> ch3mical: Like I said.. I'm just trolling a bit, it's not like my opinion matters  (I just think that 6 functions for ajax is too much)
[14:15:51] <ajpiano> what if i want to cancel the event that fires in order to allow me to cancel the event from firing
[14:15:53] <ajpiano> WHAT THEN!?
[14:16:00] <ch3mical> systemfault: your argument is like saying they should do away with .ajax() because the programmer could just write his own function to handle ajax, or do away with .css() because they could use the javascript function for modifying element attributes
[14:16:02] <JeffJassky_> haha
[14:16:06] <orolo> inception
[14:16:23] <systemfault> ch3mical: Not really, the main goal is to normalize the DOM.
[14:16:43] <ajpiano> ch3mical, you really think the ajax helper methods are like, bloat or something?
[14:16:53] <systemfault> ajpiano: He doesn't
[14:16:53] <ch3mical> systemfault: what does that have to do with .ajax() and .get() etc?
[14:17:00] <ch3mical> ajpiano: systemfault does ;)
[14:17:00] <ajpiano> oh, you do
[14:17:01] <ajpiano> whoops
[14:17:28] <systemfault> ch3mical: Was replying to your argument that they should do away with .ajax.
[14:17:45] <systemfault> ch3mical: They cannot as it's a normalizing function.
[14:18:05] <orolo> i have a general jQuery question: i've used .unbind().bind() when dealing w/ dynamic pages; in the console, how do i check what is 'bound' ?
[14:18:06] <ch3mical> systemfault: but it's the same reasoning you gave for not having a .get() function
[14:18:08] <ajpiano> systemfault: i can say categorically that we're not going to be dropping those helper functions
[14:18:23] <ch3mical> They could just do it with .ajax()... well, we could also just do AJAX with stright JS
[14:18:26] <ch3mical> straight*
[14:18:29] <systemfault> ajpiano: Never said that you would ;)
[14:18:51] <systemfault> ch3mical: Don't you understand the idea of normalization?
[14:19:07] <systemfault> That's the main reason to use a library.
[14:19:13] <ajpiano> systemfault: you're just saying that you *think* we should ?
[14:19:24] <ch3mical> That doesn't mean there are secondary reasons to use a library
[14:19:35] <ch3mical> are not*
[14:19:45] <systemfault> ajpiano: It was just a "thought" that I unleashed on the channel, never thought that ch3mical would take it that seriously.
[14:19:50] <ajpiano> haha ok :)
[14:20:02] <ch3mical> I'm just explaining to him "why" they exist
[14:20:04] <systemfault> ajpiano: I tend to prefer more general interfaces to tons of shortcut.
[14:20:08] <ch3mical> He doesn't seem to get it
[14:20:09] <ch3mical> lol
[14:20:21] <ajpiano> i agree, but when people are getting started, the helpers are dead simple
[14:20:31] <systemfault> ajpiano: I agree on that :)
[14:20:49] <systemfault> And hey.. jQuery is that widely-used because it's easy to use.
[14:20:52] <ajpiano> what you guys are doing is arguing past each other :p
[14:21:02] <TC_> http://pastebin.com/nBuCa6Yn < On line to, it causes an issue with IE7. Error: Expected identifier, string or number.
[14:21:06] <TC_> two*
[14:21:07] <systemfault> ajpiano: It's IRC, it's our national sport.
[14:21:12] <ajpiano> hahaha
[14:21:14] <TC_> Any way I can fix this?
[14:21:25] <diegoviola> thanks for the help guys, jquery rocks
[14:21:32] <ch3mical> Well I have to get back to work anyway... so ... in the tradition of IRC... I left, therefore, I win.
[14:21:36] <ch3mical> pwned.
[14:21:37] <ch3mical> ;)
[14:21:38] <imsky> trololol
[14:21:38] <ajpiano> TC, you have a trailing comma in your object literal
[14:21:39] <systemfault> ch3mical: Haha :D
[14:21:51] <ajpiano> tc, get rid of the comma at the end of line 3
[14:21:57] <BinaryKitten> one of these days i want to go up to ajpiano and hug him till he calls security
[14:21:58] <TC_> let me try
[14:22:06] <ajpiano> BinaryKitten: i'll take it!
[14:22:29] <ryanneufed> I almost did when we wrote that widget
[14:22:35] <diegoviola> what do you guys think of coffeescript? does it work with jquery? is it nice?
[14:22:39] <orolo> ajpiano: i enjoyed your talk on the widget factory; btw. thank you.
[14:22:46] <ajpiano> thanks orolo :)
[14:22:46] <BinaryKitten> which widget ryanneufed
[14:22:51] <imsky> diegoviola: it works with jquery, no worries there
[14:23:02] <ryanneufed> none publicly available right now
[14:23:03] <TC_> Well done ajpiano.
[14:23:06] <systemfault> diegoviola: Coffescript is nice, works with jQuery AFAIK but can be difficult to debug so I avoid it for bigger projects
[14:23:08] <TC_> Stupid IE7. It never effected others
[14:23:14] <systemfault> diegoviola: (My opinion)
[14:23:17] <BinaryKitten> effected?
[14:23:26] <TC_> affected*
[14:23:27] <diegoviola> i see, thanks guys
[14:23:29] <BinaryKitten> :D
[14:23:31] <TC_> or whatever... I get mixed up
[14:23:45] <ajpiano> TC_: http://www.enterprisedojo.com/2010/12/19/beware-the-trailing-comma-of-death/
[14:23:45] <BinaryKitten> something's effect affects something else
[14:24:25] <posplaw> could someone say me how to put text into textarea onto current cursor position?
[14:24:30] <TC_> strangely enough, it didn't affect IE8, just IE7 and .. below
[14:25:08] <TC_> but still, it';s the trailing comma of death :P
[14:26:36] <systemfault> I changed my coding style to avoid them :P (Comma-first style :P )
[14:26:39] <BinaryKitten> OF DEAAAAATTTHHHHH!!!!!!!
[14:30:15] <TC_> the reason why it was there is because I had something after it that I commented out.
[14:30:24] <TC_> but it never effected firefox so I didn't figure it out quickly
[14:30:46] <hooloovoo> Heya! Anyone knows if i can bind events to elements that i get from a ajax request?
[14:30:55] <ccmonster> yes
[14:30:57] <ccmonster> .live()
[14:31:04] <TC_> you can use .elegate too
[14:31:19] <TC_> Not sure about .bind
[14:31:20] <hooloovoo> Sweet, thanks a lot =)
[14:31:50] <ccmonster> bind wont work unless the element exists on the dom at the time of bimding
[14:32:01] <ccmonster> live binds to current, and future elements
[14:32:07] <hooloovoo> any downsides to using it?
[14:32:16] <ccmonster> um, cant think of any at the moment.
[14:32:27] <hooloovoo> like slower or something? or should i just start using .live all the time? =P
[14:32:37] <gnarf> hooloovoo: there are reasons to use either
[14:32:50] <gnarf> hooloovoo: using live puts the event you are watching on the document/window
[14:32:58] <gnarf> (can never remember which of those)
[14:33:09] <grumm3t> I created a few <option>'s in my <select> and i want to loop over them using $("#id").each(function(){}) but it's not returning any of the children... is there any reason the jquery generated content wouldn't be visible to jquery?
[14:33:16] <gnarf> so it will have to listen to every "click" for instance if you live "click"
[14:33:22] <gnarf> its not that bad performance wise
[14:33:34] <gnarf> it really depends on how many elements you are binding to
[14:33:37] <gnarf> etc
[14:34:08] <gnarf> grumm3t: $("#selectId").children().each() ?
[14:34:11] <hooloovoo> gnarf: Okies, thanks
[14:34:39] <BinaryKitten> question.. does .fadeOut and .fadeIn return a defferred now?
[14:34:40] <grumm3t> gnarf: .children() isn't returning the children
[14:35:11] <ccmonster> gnarf, i have var searcher{} var paramaeters{} , each with their own init9). parameter init() creates a parameter.data, which a later searcher.method uses. How do I make sure parameter.data is defined before the searcher.method fires
[14:35:14] <TC_> Try what gnarf suggested, it's different to what you're trying.
[14:35:55] <BinaryKitten> if (typeof parmeter.data != 'undefined') ?? @ ccmonster?
[14:36:02] <gnarf> ccmonster: inside the method - if (!this.data) return; // unitiliazed
[14:36:25] <BinaryKitten> gnarf if data = false ??
[14:36:27] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: no - but .promise() afterwords will give you a promise that is resolved after all animations in the fx queue complete
[14:36:37] <BinaryKitten> ok
[14:36:54] <BinaryKitten> and difference between deferred and promise is?
[14:36:57] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: which means you can use it like a deferred (because it has a promise method)
[14:37:06] <ccmonster> hmm.
[14:37:09] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: a deferred has resolve/reject methods, promises do not
[14:37:13] <ccmonster> because right now It's always coming up undefined
[14:37:25] <ccmonster> even though if i run it, the method works properly.
[14:37:30] <gnarf> i.e. the deferred is the actual thing, the promise is just an "observable only" version of the promise
[14:38:34] <trevatwork> hey -- anyone in here want to recommend a plugin that adds a timepicker feature to the existing jQuery UI datepicker?  there seem to be a couple options
[14:39:10] <gnarf> BinaryKitten: that last word in my last message should be "deferred"
[14:39:38] <ccmonster> can i do a callback on any method?
[14:39:59] <gnarf> ccmonster: pretty much - callbacks are just functions that you call :)
[14:40:14] <ccmonster> yea, but they occur after a function has completed.
[14:40:15] <gnarf> ccmonster: although around #jquery we like to call em hollabacks
[14:40:21] <grumm3t> trevatwork: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[14:40:22] <ccmonster> which appears to be the problem
[14:40:29] <ccmonster> lol @ hollabacks
[14:40:37] <trevatwork> grumm3t: cool -- that's the one I'm looking at now
[14:43:41] <joelt_nz> does jsonp report on a 500 error?
[14:43:59] <joelt_nz> I've set a .error method, but it's not getting called
[14:46:11] <ccmonster> hey gnarf , callback: function(func){f(typeof func == 'function'){callbackFnk.call(this);
[14:46:11] <ccmonster> }
[14:46:17] <ccmonster> is that a basic way of doing it?
[14:46:44] <gnarf> yeah --- see ?jQuery.isFunction too
[14:46:44] <bot-t> jQuery.isFunction(): Determine if the argument passed is a Javascript function object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isFunction/
[14:47:27] <biodegabriel> Hey all, I'm want to adapt a jquery plugin that currently only works with 1.2.6 so that it can work with 1.6.1, but I'm not sure where to start? Are there any tricks or tools that can help me figure out what exactly is incompatible in this plugin with 1.6.1?
[14:47:28] <ccmonster> if(jQuery.isFucntion(func)){
[14:47:31] <ccmonster> liek so?
[14:47:50] <biodegabriel> This is the plugin I want to adapt. http://webdev.stephband.info/parallax_demos.html
[14:50:14] <ccmonster> here we go, is this a proper callback : http://pastie.org/1918653
[14:50:28] <ccmonster> minus the missing bracket. ugg
[14:53:37] <biodegabriel> firebug doesn't tell me anything. it just fails silently.
[14:53:52] <ccmonster> breakpoints

[15:03:38] <rguillebert> Hi
[15:04:42] <rguillebert> Can I apply a selector on a dom object ?
[15:05:07] <rguillebert> $(dom)(".filter") doesn't seem to work
[15:05:48] <ngharo> you mean $(foo).filter('.class')
[15:05:51] <jqp> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1172 mentions http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8327 as a proposed solution, but the fiddle in the proposed solution (http://jsfiddle.net/d8ckU/1/) uses setInterval() to poll the jqXHR responseText every millisecond, which seems very inefficient.
[15:06:02] <rguillebert> no I think it's find
[15:06:20] <deinspanjer> I'm wondering if there is a straightforward way for the javascript executed by the browser via  a <script src="…"> tag to  "introspect" the URL it was called from.  Does this make sense and if so, is there an easy way?
[15:06:32] <jqp> is the solution proposed in that jsfiddle a hack to address what really is a bug?
[15:06:50] <rguillebert> yes it's find
[15:11:28] <JFranks> Anyone know if there's anything in jQuery that would help me push some user data into forms on an external page and return the results?
[15:11:55] <deinspanjer> JFranks: is the page one in your domain?
[15:12:13] <deinspanjer> i.e. is your jquery script being loaded by that page and in that page's domain?
[15:12:21] <polarbear4> i am doing a custom drag and drop with svg and want to know if i am over a div while dragging something. problem is that with mouseover, it won't see it because my mouse is actually over the thing i am dragging around. it needs to look below that.
[15:12:48] <mehale> hi.
[15:13:05] <JFranks> No, the page is completely external.. I have two Javascript commands figured out that will when manually executed fill the form and push the submit button but how to automate that and fetch the result.. woah. ;)
[15:13:28] <deinspanjer> JFranks: I don't believe that jQuery by itself is going to help you much there.
[15:13:56] <JFranks> deinspanjer: Yes I'd expect it'd be an AJAX like call to cURL?
[15:14:04] <deinspanjer> you need some user agent level harness to be able to execute arbitrary code on a website that you don't control..
[15:14:31] <deinspanjer> it might be a bookmarklet that the user clicks, or an add-on like Greasemonkey or Jetpack or the various other browser versions..
[15:14:59] <JFranks> deinspanjer: I have debated making the users run a plugin.. but it seems a bit excessive.. ;)
[15:15:22] <deinspanjer> Is the user initiating this action?
[15:15:58] <JFranks> deinspanjer: correct, they would be filling in a form on the page that would take the form data and try getting results from the external site..
[15:16:00] <deinspanjer> if so, look into bookmarklets.  it might be just enough to do what you need.
[15:17:21] <mehale> whats the best way to submit a form after typing on text input field?
[15:17:30] <JFranks> For example if a writer is adding a story and wants to verify the title is unique, it should fire off a google search in the last year for the title wrapped in "" quotes to do an exact match and then notify if any hits were made..
[15:23:32] <diegoviola> orolo: $(".user_list").replaceWith($(data).find(".user_list")); -- did the trick for me, thanks ;)
[15:26:15] <ColKurtz> mehale, you mean automatically submit the form after typing into the text input and the input loses focus?
[15:26:33] <ColKurtz> or having hints as you type, like in google search?
[15:26:44] <mehale> ColKurtz: yes, after some n seconds of inactivity or user press enter
[15:27:07] <ColKurtz> That doesn't sound very user friendly to me...people don't expect that to happen
[15:27:28] <ColKurtz> maybe they start typing..then realize they found the link on the page that they were looking for
[15:27:37] <ColKurtz> so they abandon typign in the search box and try to click the link instead
[15:27:50] <ColKurtz> then BAM all of a sudden the search has been auto-submitted without their consent and they're taken away
[15:28:04] <ccmonster> so if i have searcher.init(options,callback) but dont have any options, how do i get the callback to fire still?
[15:28:21] <hermanus> does anyone have a solution when it comes to running ie7 & 8 nicely in linux? i'm kind of tired of switching virtual machines, and i dont want to buy extra memory just because IE exists. But i surely need IE for debugging.
[15:28:25] <ColKurtz> of course there could be an appropriate use-case i'm not thinking of
[15:28:35] <mehale> ColKurtz: this is a very specific app, and I will be only fetching ajax data
[15:29:13] <mehale> ColKurtz: actually, I am not submitting the form, but must call a func after it
[15:30:32] <blindMoe> is there a way to tell if an element is a child of a specific type of element?  ie:  I want to see if my current element is a child of a <thead> or <tfoot> element
[15:30:48] <blindMoe> I see the isChildOf() plugin but it is a few years old..
[15:31:02] <polarbear4> i am doing a custom drag and drop and want to know if i am over a div while dragging something. problem is that with mouseover, it won't see it because my mouse is actually over the thing i am dragging around. it needs to look below that to the thing i want to drop it on.
[15:31:36] <hermanus> polarbear4, you can set a class for the placeholder and set it via css
[15:31:57] <gnarf> anyone around here happen to have their Internet Exploder 6-9 VM's sitting around? :)
[15:32:16] <gnarf> (left the drive that has them @ home :/)
[15:32:29] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/ -- need to know if this reports "aliceblue" in any browser....
[15:32:41] <polarbear4> hermanus: what do you mean? i can't get the mouseover at all because the event never triggers. it is my drop zone i want to have a hover class and the mouseover doesn't trigger because i am dragging a thing that is what my mouse is over.
[15:33:02] <polarbear4> gnarf: i get - rgb(240, 248, 255)
[15:33:35] <hermanus> gnarf, i can check ie6 in a minute
[15:34:36] <polarbear4> gnarf: ie7 and 8 aren't showing anything for me.
[15:35:24] <hermanus> gnarf, nothing in ie6
[15:35:41] <gnarf> like no output??
[15:35:45] <polarbear4> nope
[15:35:48] <hermanus> like completely white
[15:35:50] <gnarf> hrm
[15:35:55] <polarbear4> hermanus, what did you mean by that css class?
[15:36:08] <hermanus> polarbear4, im starting eclipse so i can see how i did that
[15:36:18] <polarbear4> okay thank you :)
[15:37:02] <gnarf> how about this: http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/1/ IE?
[15:37:55] <hermanus> that works in ie6
[15:38:05] <gnarf> whats it give back for the color?
[15:38:21] <gnarf> the text after "testing div"
[15:38:48] <djbokkeman> Hi Guys. I would like to sync 2 textareas. Is this possible ?
[15:38:51] <hermanus> polarbear4, when you add     placeholder: "ui-state-highlight"     as a parameter to the sortable, a placeholder will automatically be created on mouseover, so you do not need to care about the mouseover event
[15:40:25] <hermanus> gnarf, it works like you coded, black bg and indianred letters
[15:40:58] <gnarf> hermanus: but no color printed out? thats the important part - i wanna see the rgb() or #xxxxxx
[15:41:10] <gnarf> maybe http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/2/ - shrug
[15:42:37] <lastent> Hi, when observing a textfield, which is the event I have to bind, for everytime the user types a new char?
[15:42:59] <SirFunk_> anyone know of an example of doing an accordion on a table? I want like the header rows to only be visible then when you click them the data drops out
[15:43:01] <SirFunk_> any ideas?
[15:43:11] <gnarf> hermanus: maybe could you take a screenshot of the result for me? :)
[15:43:25] <hermanus> gnarf, it says indianred, so you're getting it back literally, it's not converted to hex or rgb
[15:44:03] <gnarf> hermanus: lame
[15:44:31] <hermanus> yea quite strange, because you should be getting the internal represenation
[15:45:11] <hermanus> maybe ie6 thinks in colornames
[15:45:39] <gnarf> hermanus: http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/2/ -- still indianred?
[15:45:46] <gnarf> er
[15:45:52] <gnarf>  /3/
[15:45:57] <gnarf> sry - paste fail
[15:46:00] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/3/
[15:46:05] <hermanus> well im sorry but ive had quite enough of pasting into the vm, ill check one more time
[15:46:15] <gnarf> hermanus: thanks a ton!!!
[15:46:34] <luchenbill> I have a background image that I would like to keep the same through all pages on my website, I have a container div however that I would like to load dynamically is this a jquery question or ajax?
[15:46:37] <hermanus> it still says indianred
[15:46:37] <gnarf> hermanus: trying to shave like 2k out of jquery-color if I can
[15:46:45] <gnarf> hermanus: fuck
[15:46:52] * gnarf grumbles @ IE
[15:47:42] <gnarf> hermanus: appreciate the assist!
[15:48:10] <hermanus> would getComputedStyle() not work?
[15:48:14] <polarbear4> hermanus, i am not using the ui drag and drop. i was creating my own.
[15:48:32] <gnarf> hermanus: I'm pretty sure that .css() reads from the computed
[15:48:45] <gnarf> hermanus: but i'll mess with it when I have my own IE vm
[15:48:47] <hermanus> ill try a little in your code
[15:49:01] <gnarf> hermanus: awesome - thanks :)
[15:49:07] <luchenbill> ?
[15:50:02] <hermanus> polarbear4, oh ok, then i cant help you
[15:52:03] <SirFunk_> is there a way to select all siblings of a node until you hit one with a certain calss?
[15:52:21] <bot-t> SirFunk_, .nextUntil([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[15:53:18] <SirFunk_> whoa there's really a nextUntil! awesome
[15:59:23] <djbokkeman> Im trying to get to textarea's in sync. I cannot get it to work. Anybody a hint ?
[15:59:28] <Jayflux> lol i didnt know about that one either SirFunk
[15:59:39] <Jayflux> SirFunk_
[15:59:53] <ColKurtz> mehale, see http://api.jquery.com/change/
[15:59:59] <mehale> thanks
[16:00:02] <ColKurtz> sorry if i'm late
[16:00:04] <ColKurtz> i had a meeting
[16:00:04] <ColKurtz> lol
[16:00:15] <mehale> np. I just found some stuff on google ;)
[16:00:23] <ColKurtz> what approach did you go with?
[16:00:28] <lastent> Hi, when observing a textfield, which is the event I have to bind, for everytime the user types a new char?
[16:00:34] <ColKurtz> b/c jQuery's change() looks perfect to me
[16:00:55] <mehale> I used keypress, catching enter, and having it return false
[16:03:48] <Jayflux> lastent .keyup or keypress or keydown dependin on what effect you want, most people use keyup though
[16:05:08] <ColKurtz> lastent, djbokkeman looks like you guys might have similar problems to work on with each other
[16:05:09] <lastent> Jayflux, mehale, ColKurtz, but the keypress, keyup, keydown, are triggered every time I press a key event if it is shift or enter, I want the event to be triggered only when a new char is added or deleted
[16:05:48] <lastent> aand change is triggered when I unfocus the input
[16:05:52] <mehale> lastent: you could try tie it to element
[16:06:08] <mehale> $(´#id´).keypress()
[16:06:19] <lastent> that is what I am doing
[16:06:35] <ColKurtz> can you exclude certain keys with keypress()?
[16:06:45] <Jayflux> yes
[16:07:08] <lastent> but I mean, if I type "hello" the event is triggered 5 times, if I type "Hello", the event is triggered 6 times
[16:07:14] <Jayflux> you can filter it so it only reacts on certain keys
[16:07:16] <Jayflux> or ignores others
[16:07:29] <ColKurtz> ^
[16:07:43] <Jayflux> for example.. say i want spacebar to do nothing
[16:07:55] <Jayflux> if (event.keyCode == '32') { event.preventDefault(); } will work, you need a map of what keys are what numbers
[16:07:59] <hermanus> gnarf, you're probably right about .css() getting it from computed. http://jsfiddle.net/tkUdR/1/ this still gives indianred literally in ie6
[16:08:15] <lastent> ok guys thanks
[16:08:49] <gnarf> hermanus: http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/5/
[16:08:54] <Jayflux> lastent you do .keyup(function(event)
[16:09:05] <gnarf> hermanus: found that via google - haven't yet tested in IE tho
[16:09:11] <Jayflux> then event.keyCode will be what key has been pressed
[16:09:26] <lastent> ok, thanks Jayflux
[16:09:34] <hermanus> ie6 says: the window has already been registered as a drop target :)
[16:10:00] <ColKurtz> but what if someone types shift+T and you ignore shifts, the input box would have a capital T, and the preview box would have a lowercase t
[16:10:15] <hermanus> gnarf, now it says object expected on line 22, char 3, great how much info ie6 gives when it comes to debugging
[16:10:30] <ColKurtz> or maybe i just don't understand what you're going for
[16:10:46] <Jayflux> true ColKurtz
[16:11:16] <Jayflux> just make it case insensative i dunno
[16:11:18] <lastent> you are right ColKurtz , thanks all of you
[16:11:47] <ColKurtz> I think you'd have better look with the googles searching for "live preview box"
[16:11:57] <ColKurtz> .google live preview box jquery
[16:12:05] <ColKurtz> er whatever the bot command is
[16:12:10] <Jayflux> ?
[16:12:11] <ColKurtz> .g live preview box jquery
[16:12:22] <Jayflux> ?live preview box jquery

[16:12:36] <ColKurtz> there we go, thanks jayflux. lol
[16:13:04] <Jayflux> np bye all nn
[16:13:07] <gnarf> hermanus: http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/6/
[16:13:19] <ColKurtz> now time for me to do my own work >:|
[16:13:32] <ColKurtz> why is working on other people's issues more fun? :D
[16:13:39] <hermanus> gnarf, it keeps whining about already being set as a drop target
[16:13:54] <gnarf> hermanus: huh...
[16:14:00] <mdel> if I have all 3 formats of a font, how easy is it to embed them rather than using cufon
[16:14:13] <hermanus> gnarf, might be in the js of jsfiddle itself
[16:14:43] <ColKurtz> mdel http://fontsquirrel.com
[16:14:45] <ColKurtz> very easy
[16:14:51] <gnarf> ColKurtz: because you don't need to care if it gets solved?
[16:14:54] <gnarf> no pressure?
[16:15:11] <ColKurtz> haha gnarf, yes and you can throw in the towel at anytime without repercussion
[16:15:14] <ColKurtz> AIN'T MY PROBLEM
[16:15:25] <mdel> ColKurtz: the generator, you mean?
[16:15:31] <ColKurtz> yes mdel
[16:15:36] <mdel> thanks :)
[16:15:40] <ColKurtz> np
[16:15:48] <gnarf> hermanus: well thanks for the assist anyway, i'll play more with that fiddle after i get back to my VM harddrive
[16:15:49] <ColKurtz> google fons API is even easier
[16:15:54] <ColKurtz> if they have your font you want to use
[16:18:12] <mdel> ColKurtz: they dont
[16:18:15] <KostasDi> clear
[16:18:18] <KostasDi> clear()
[16:18:42] <hermanus> gnarf, np. if i'll get bored i'll try to debug it with firebug lite and let you know. but it doesnt seem like much fun to work on, ie always makes me cranky
[16:18:48] <mdel> ColKurtz: also, I'm using FontXChange for Mac to convert them... they export with an HTML page containing the proper CSS declarations!
[16:18:53] <mdel> +1 for this app
[16:19:08] <gnarf> hermanus: if I can get it to work, it will prolly shave like ~2k off the filesize of jquery-color
[16:19:52] <hermanus> gnarf, that would be a good thing
[16:20:21] <ColKurtz> mdel, hm haven't used FontXChange before, wonder how it is. But I know that fontsquirrel automagically converts the font to all the right files with most widely compatible stylesheet. i'll check FontXChange sometime
[16:20:44] <mdel> ColKurtz: i'm going to try fontsquirrel too, compare the results. ill let you know
[16:20:51] <ColKurtz> cool man
[16:23:28] <SirFunk_> is there any reason when i slideToggle an element it doesn't do anything for a whiel then just dissapears? (it doesn't slide)
[16:28:34] <ColKurtz> sirfunk_ make a jsfiddle
[16:29:19] <SirFunk_> ColKurtz: ok, one min, need to pear down the code a bunch
[16:30:58] <gnarf> hermanus: http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/8/
[16:31:44] <hermanus> that's working, it gives hex
[16:31:59] <hermanus> #cd5c5c
[16:32:41] <gnarf> coo
[16:33:17] <hermanus> gnarf, not even an error popping up!
[16:38:26] <gasdfwalker> If I have 3 text inputs with different names, is there any way to make jQ make unique javascript variables for them using .each()?
[16:40:39] <SirFunk_> ColKurtz: http://jsfiddle.net/TTfKu/   click either of the rows in the table.. the other rows should slide in.. not just appear
[16:43:09] <ColKurtz> sirfunk i wonder if it has to do with them being table cells instead of block elements
[16:43:18] <ColKurtz> sorry i can't help more I have work to do :X
[16:43:42] <ColKurtz> but now that you have a fiddle somebody else is bound to be able to help :D
[16:44:16] <ColKurtz> sirfunk_ see http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-slidedown-slideup-problems-when-using-tables
[16:44:47] <antihero> what's a good simple image uploader plugin has a % and will integrate with python?
[16:45:23] <ColKurtz> yep sirfunk_ it's beccause they're not block elements.
[16:45:38] <ColKurtz> you could show/hide the table row, then fade in the row contents
[16:46:38] <ColKurtz> sirfunk_ see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/467336/jquery-how-to-use-slidedown-or-show-function-on-a-table-row
[16:46:48] <ColKurtz> you can wrap your table row in a <div> and perform the slide on the div instead
[16:48:21] <hermanus> does anyone know an alternative to livecss? https://github.com/ooyala/livecss the idea is great, only the implementation is a little buggy and heavy for some browsers. maybe ill start forking it, but it would be great if theres already an alternative or other ppl willing to also work on it. it could easily be extended to loading js-changes live also.
[16:49:24] <gasdfwalker> If I have 3 text inputs with different names, is there any way to make jQ make unique javascript variables for them using .each()?
[16:49:27] <hermanus> it's like working in jsfiddle, but you can stick to your favourite ide
[16:50:40] <ColKurtz> but in jsfiddle you still have to click "Run" (same as refresh"
[16:50:46] <ajpiano> hermanus: i tried it for a few minutes
[16:51:19] <ajpiano> it just bogs up the console full of xhrs and like, if you stop working with the site for a few minutes all of a sudden it's just like 100s of xhrs like, cmon, who wants that :p
[16:51:47] <hermanus> ajpiano, yeah, apache even crashed on debian because of the requests, thats what i mean with being a little heavy
[16:52:08] <hermanus> but the idea is great
[16:52:59] <JFranks> Okay I need to make millions, but I have zero code skill .. Time on site is a really good thing and spam is a really bad thing.. if your Captcha system is a video game the time on site goes up and the spam goes down? .. Anyone picking up what I'm putting down here? ;)
[16:53:47] <JFranks> (Praying some smartass will drop a link to something already done like this saying I'm years too late (source code would be nice too))
[16:54:43] <erichynds> wat
[16:54:49] <dec1bel> There are puzzle captchas that already exist out there
[16:54:53] <erichynds> captcha's are evil
[16:55:02] <dec1bel> Although I haven't seen any that are fun
[16:55:35] <JFranks> Exactly.. it has to be a bit of fun.. hell it should include your score with the submission so I know how smart the author is..
[16:55:58] <abjorn> Hm, Austin JS is supposed to meet up in like half an hour and I'm still not sure if I should go to it haha
[16:55:58] <bot-t> (2 hours 35 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn wigglin' forever
[16:56:04] <abjorn> lol imsky
[16:57:40] <SirFunk_> ColKurtz: thanks
[16:57:48] <ColKurtz> np
[16:58:13] <geekbuntu> imsky cracks me up
[16:58:34] <SirFunk_> ColKurtz: i think i tried something like that before and wrapping the rows in a <div> makes the widths funny, but now that i know that problem i'll fingure something out
[16:58:41] <abjorn> yeah gotta love dat imsky
[16:58:56] <ColKurtz> maybe wrap tables in rows?
[16:59:00] <ColKurtz> i mean
[16:59:03] <ColKurtz> tables in <divs> ?
[17:00:10] <abjorn> gawd why does the austinjs meetup have to be on 6th street :(
[17:00:38] <bittyx-laptop> hi all! i'm gonna do a bit of ajax, and in preparation of that i have a question - if i pass the result of PHP's json_encode($array) function to jQuery's .parseJSON(), can i assume this will work as expected?
[17:00:42] <ch3mical> Blah!
[17:01:00] <ch3mical> bittyx-laptop: absolutely
[17:01:41] <__machine> anyone got a better date range picker than http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/date_range_picker_using_jquery_ui_16_and_jquery_ui_css_framework/ ?
[17:02:52] <bittyx-laptop> ch3mical: cool, thanks.
[17:03:05] <ch3mical> bittyx-laptop: even better would be to use .getJSON()
[17:03:22] <abjorn> anyone from austin in here right now? :o
[17:03:28] <abjorn> o brodingo, you're here
[17:03:33] <Zerxer> quick question, if I do .bind('keyup keydown'), is there a way to tell which of the two events triggered the function? does the passed 'event' object contain anything I can look at? too lazy to do two separate binds
[17:03:38] <ch3mical> bittyx-laptop: see ?getJSON()
[17:03:39] <bot-t> bittyx-laptop, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[17:03:42] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[17:03:45] <Zerxer> I was in austin last night, abjorn. at Main Event
[17:03:49] <abjorn> you gonna go to austinjs?
[17:03:56] <abjorn> it's in like 30 minutes and im still undecided lol
[17:04:00] <Brodingo> naw im already a few beers deep
[17:04:05] <abjorn> rofl
[17:04:09] <bittyx-laptop> ch3mical: okay, i'm a competent php dev, but a real beginner at javascript and it's libraries/frameworks, so i've got no idea. is there some sort of "best practices" guide for jquery? the examples on api.jquery.com are pretty simple.
[17:04:15] <Brodingo> just go dude, meet some peeps
[17:04:30] <Zerxer> I'd go if austin wasn't a bit over 1h away
[17:04:31] <Zerxer> maybe
[17:04:32] <abjorn> IM ANTI-SOCIAL
[17:04:35] <Zerxer> me too :(
[17:04:37] <abjorn> I'll be the guy who sits in the back on his laptop
[17:04:37] <ch3mical> bittyx-laptop: if you stick to the API docs, you'll be solid
[17:04:40] <abjorn> not tlaking to anyone
[17:04:45] <bittyx-laptop> ch3mical: okay, thanks a lot.
[17:04:48] <abjorn> eh fuck it ill go. at least theres a parking garage right there
[17:04:49] <Brodingo> well
[17:04:49] <ch3mical> bittyx-laptop: np
[17:04:58] <Brodingo> yeah get that txjs tick
[17:05:07] <abjorn> I doubt I will lol
[17:05:11] <Brodingo> I BELIEVE IN YOU ABJORN*
[17:05:19] <abjorn> YEEAAAH
[17:06:05] <ch3mical> Zerxer: "event" should pass the event that triggered it, I believe
[17:06:05] <abjorn> Hm, apparently they have free beer. I hope they don't care that I'm a minor :3
[17:06:06] <Tamo> Hello. I use jQuery 1.2.3 on my site, should I expect if I upgrade to 1.6 it cause any issues? Will there be any improvement? lol
[17:06:23] <Zerxer> ch3mical: alright, figured it would. just did some tests now and yea event.type has it. cool
[17:06:34] <ch3mical> Sweet
[17:06:47] <abjorn> well, imma get ready L8R brodingo and everyone else
[17:06:59] <Brodingo> wooo
[17:07:01] <ch3mical> abjorn: have one for me
[17:07:02] <ch3mical> ;p
[17:07:23] <abjorn> haha I wont because I hate beer and because they probably won't let me have any if I'm a minor ;(
[17:07:49] <ch3mical> lol
[17:08:07] <abjorn> I'm a liquor kinda guy
[17:08:13] <ch3mical> I hear ya

[17:08:28] <beasty> $('#home_leave_table tr:last').insertAfter(html);
[17:08:32] <beasty> i do this
[17:08:44] <beasty> but for some reason he deletes the tr's
[17:09:22] <ch3mical> beasty: if you don't want it removed from the table, clone it first
[17:09:35] <beasty> ch3mical: ?
[17:09:44] <ch3mical> I guess you should explain your issue better
[17:09:50] <bittyx-laptop> ch3mical: actually, now that i think about it, i have a bit of a design problem here. from an architecture point of view, is it better to pass an object as JSON or XML and then form the HTML for displaying client-side (which seems kind of non-redundant and efficient as to bandwidth/overall architecture), or make the final HTML on the server and just insert it into the page via jQuery? the latter seems better in the case where i have a standard
[17:09:50] <bittyx-laptop> way of displaying an object, so if i ever change the way i display it, there's only one HTML-forming PHP function to change (whereas with the first solution, i'd have to change that function, as well as the one in javascript).
[17:10:08] <beasty> ch3mical: i just want to add a row in a excisting table ;)
[17:10:40] <ch3mical> Oh, I read that wrong, hang on
[17:10:51] <bittyx-laptop> ie. the first seems a better object-oriented approach, whereas the second one is more maintainable
[17:11:28] <ch3mical> bittyx-laptop: if you're just trying to inject some html, you might consider putting the html in a file and use see ?load()
[17:11:29] <bot-t> bittyx-laptop, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[17:11:47] <ch3mical> I think that's the wrong one
[17:12:04] <ch3mical> This one http://api.jquery.com/load/
[17:12:47] <bittyx-laptop> ch3mical: well i don't intend on manipulating the objects in javascript, except for displaying them, so i guess that's it. thanks again!
[17:13:06] <ch3mical> beasty: do it this way: $('<html>').insertAfter('selector');
[17:13:12] <bittyx-laptop> yeah, that looks like what i need. awesome.
[17:13:24] <ch3mical> bittyx-laptop: np
[17:14:06] <ch3mical> beasty: if you want to specify the selector first, like in your example, change "insertAfter" to "after"
[17:14:11] <beasty> ch3mical: .append() did the trick
[17:14:27] <beasty> $('#home_leave_table').append(html);
[17:14:43] <ch3mical> That works too
[17:15:04] <ch3mical> If you ever want to insert a row between some other rows, use the insertAfter method ;)
[17:15:23] <cooper> hey
[17:16:08] <cooper> is there a specific channel for jquery mobile? or is all just 1one channel here?
[17:16:18] <ch3mical> Ok, I'm outta here
[17:16:25] <erichynds> cooper: #jquerymobile
[17:16:35] <cooper> thanks for that
[17:18:35] <geekbuntu> erichynds, you have a few minutes for a couple of questions?
[17:18:50] <erichynds> i'm actually about to head out.  sorry :/
[17:18:57] <geekbuntu> np, have a good night
[17:27:11] <FLeiXiuS> I have a string that looks ike "Object { name="Nick" } How would I serialize this into something usable in a conditional.  So I could do if name == nick, etc.
[17:27:31] <FLeiXiuS> Meh string = variable.
[17:29:08] <Zerxer> first, why do you have a string like that
[17:29:24] <FLeiXiuS> It's being returned from faye in that way.
[17:29:28] <FLeiXiuS> And its a var.
[17:29:38] <FLeiXiuS> Just trying to determine how to parse it.
[17:32:52] <FLeiXiuS> Meh Im an idiot, varname.name
[17:35:30] <cooper> i know this is not mobile channel, but no one seems to be around there. Im having this small problem with dialog box for jquery mobile, and curious to know if any one here able to help?
[17:36:01] <coldhead> http://twitter.com/#!/CharlieCurve/status/70501367919292416
[17:36:05] <antixsuperstar> let's say i create an <a> whose href attr is used by an ajax call (when this anchor is clicked). to avoid the <a> to actually taking the browser there, i attach a function with the event click and inside the function a 'return false;' is called. most of the times it works, but from time to time with certain instructions, the function attached to the click event exits and the click event succeeds, taking the browser to where the href attr points
[17:36:05] <antixsuperstar> to. i hope i made myself clear. any ideas? thanks!
[17:36:39] <coldhead> ?preventdefault @ antixsuperstar
[17:36:39] <bot-t> antixsuperstar, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[17:36:57] <coldhead> if you call that immediately in your handler you should be fine, whatever happens after
[17:37:03] <FLeiXiuS> antixsuperstar, Are you just created named anchor links?
[17:38:07] <antixsuperstar> FLeiXiuS: sorry for my ignorance. what is a named anchor?
[17:38:32] <antixsuperstar> coldhead: ahhhhh! when did this happen? i was so old on the return false approach. thanks!
[17:38:42] <antixsuperstar> coldhead: I'll try it right now
[17:39:03] <coldhead> <a name="lol">This is the lol</a> <a href="lol">Click this for lol</a>
[17:39:09] <coldhead> i think that is a named anchor
[17:39:15] <antixsuperstar> coldhead: ah! hehe no, no named anchors
[17:39:19] <FLeiXiuS> Yep, just link to #lol
[17:39:31] <coldhead> oops, #lol*
[17:39:33] <FLeiXiuS> :-P
[17:39:35] <antixsuperstar> coldhead: rarely use'em
[17:39:39] <coldhead> sorry it's my first day using <a>s
[17:40:31] <coldhead> antixsuperstar: there are some interesting blogs comparing return false and preventDefault if you are bored
[17:42:02] <antixsuperstar> coldhead: bring'em on!
[17:42:16] <antixsuperstar> i kinda did something weird
[17:42:21] <antixsuperstar> but it worked...
[17:43:40] <antixsuperstar> coldhead: a "var foo = bar.match()", bar being a String, was somehow (i guess) returning true and making the <a> event continue
[17:44:11] <coldhead> i see
[17:44:50] <antixsuperstar> coldhead: no javascript errors at all, simply the callback returned and the f*ing <a> continued its task indifferently
[17:45:34] <coldhead> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[17:47:09] <antixsuperstar> what i did was (horribly, i might say), put THAT statement inside an "in-line"? self-executing function (sorry my lack of proper tems): var foo; (function() { foo = bar.match(); });
[17:47:43] <antixsuperstar> and the callback didn't break. but god is a horrible workaround :S
[17:48:10] <coldhead> yes that would be a discip;linary matter if you were on my team
[17:48:24] <coldhead> then later: icecream!
[17:48:50] <antixsuperstar> XD
[17:49:32] <antixsuperstar> coldhead: thanks for the insight :)
[17:55:36] <Whirl3d> anybody know what this error means: Node cannot be inserted at the specified point in the hierarchy" code: "3
[17:56:03] <vmasto> Hello gang, I'm in the middle of a little experiment and I'm facing a completely outrageous but interesting problem: I'm trying to reverse the way an element hides itself.
[17:56:32] <Whirl3d> vmasto: and...
[17:56:51] <vmasto> What I'm actually trying to make is a pseudo equalizer, but watch here what happens: http://www.manoskantzas.com/test.html
[17:57:05] <vmasto> it's upside down (of course because height changes from bottom to top)
[17:57:46] <vmasto> I found a way to keep the bottom of the elements steady and 'seemingly' slide themselves down to nothingness but then it appears fake like so: http://www.manoskantzas.com/test2.html
[17:58:20] <vmasto> what I'm after is pretty much the /test.html example, but mirrored!
[17:58:33] <vmasto> Does anyone have any magnificent idea on how this could be achieved?
[17:59:36] <Whirl3d> vmasto, how are you doing it now? by animating a bg element?
[17:59:41] <vmasto> So the element needs to start hiding itself, cropping 1 pixel at a time, from TOP top bottom
[18:00:00] <vmasto> Whirl3d: nope, I animate the height of the elements (view source)
[18:00:49] <vmasto> Whirl3d: I've tried animatnig the element's background-position but the effect is the same as test2.html
[18:01:03] <Whirl3d> vmasto, I was looking at your source...just the animate background script. I didn't realize you had it in your html. LOL
[18:01:19] <vmasto> Whirl3d: oops yeah forgot to remove that script :)
[18:02:10] <gnarf> vmasto: animating background position requires using a cssHook to make backgroundPositionX and backgroundPositionY
[18:02:15] <vmasto> i've been searching for 2 days, for a way to reverse the way height works, but noone seems to have ever done it, probably noone bothered
[18:02:31] <vmasto> gnarf: I'm not trying to animate background-position
[18:02:50] <gnarf> "I've tried animatnig the element's background-position"
[18:03:24] <vmasto> gnarf: Yes, what I meant was, I've tried to solve my problem by animating the element's background-position but to no avail
[18:03:58] <Whirl3d> vmasto, just animate you height and align bottom
[18:04:13] <vmasto> Whirl3d: align meaning absolutely positioning?
[18:04:36] <Whirl3d> vmasto, lemme try it out. brb
[18:04:57] <vmasto> Whirl3d: I've also tried absolutely positioning the elements to the bottom of the parent div, but still it didn't work :S
[18:05:32] <gnarf> vmasto: can you convert your test into a jsfiddle?
[18:06:23] <vmasto> gnarf: yes one sec, sorry for not doing it in advance
[18:07:09] <gnarf> wow, this thing is killing inspector
[18:07:10] <gnarf> :)
[18:07:25] <gnarf> so many property edits....
[18:08:30] <vmasto> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/7PRzp/
[18:09:06] <gnarf> and what did you change for test2?
[18:09:10] <vmasto> gnarf: yes you are right, we can probably remove the 4 .bars
[18:10:04] <vmasto> you edit .bar to remove float:left and force it to display: inline-block !important
[18:10:17] <bittyx-laptop> hmm i have an input box, and i've bound a .change() with a simple alert function. however, while i type in the input box, nothing is happening, alert only gets called when i click my mouse outside of the input box, or TAB to another element, etc. how can i trigger a function while typing in an input box?
[18:10:17] <joshontheweb> bundy, looks good

[18:11:27] <vmasto> gnarf: i love you
[18:11:55] <vmasto> i knew i needed a clean (and smarter) brain
[18:12:03] <phed__> Hi, I am making a site for this encyclopedia i found
[18:12:05] <gnarf> vmasto: :)
[18:12:20] <vmasto> didnt even think about doing it that way, just stupidly trying to do it by absolutely positioning the elements
[18:12:21] <vmasto> :D
[18:12:30] <phed__> in the current data stuff looks typically like this "<a href="../NATMANDSFOLK"><b>Natmandsfolk</b></a>"
[18:12:45] <bittyx-laptop> ah, i've got it, i need .keyup() instead of .change()
[18:13:46] <coldhead> are you saying gnarf has been brain washed?
[18:13:47] <coldhead> how dare you
[18:14:00] <macheleon> sup
[18:14:18] <coldhead> hi macheleon
[18:14:38] <vmasto> coldhead: gnarf has been brainwashed by a thousand unicorn programmers
[18:14:58] <kojiro> and one dolphin with an oedipus complex.
[18:15:40] <coldhead> the poor bastard
[18:15:45] <coldhead> that sounds rough
[18:18:17] <phed__> now, i want all links to point to the same page, since i want it all ajax - any ideas on how i should form my links?
[18:20:15] <gnarf> unicorn programmers?
[18:20:43] <vmasto> phed__: what do you mean form your links? shouldn't they be pointing to the new page you want them to point to?
[18:21:50] <phed__> vmasto: i am having a hundred articles, but i want to load the articles via ajax. they are currently stored as json
[18:21:54] <FLeiXiuS> Anyone mind checking my variables out.  For some reason, lastLoc is return null.  I dont know why its not being set.  http://pastie.org/1919413
[18:22:07] <electronplusplus> where can I download Rocket Pack?
[18:22:50] <FLeiXiuS> Im thinking, since I'm within a function, my var is being set as a local var
[18:22:53] <FLeiXiuS> and removing itself.
[18:23:05] <phed__> vmasto: so i _sorta_ think I should just set href="articleid" (eg. natmand) and then rewrite it to "#" and add a handler i guess
[18:23:48] <vmasto> phed__: If I were you I would form the links as so: <a href="#" rel="articleID or JSON reference">Article Title</a> and grab the rel via javascript passing it into the json and retrieving the data
[18:24:04] <phed__> ah, what is "rel" for?
[18:24:17] <vmasto> anchor relation
[18:24:22] <phed__> vmasto: this stuff is google juice, however - is there a way to retain that?
[18:24:43] <vmasto> Sets or retrieves the relationship between the object and the destination of the link.
[18:24:45] <Whirl3d> vmasto, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/pXcpX/12/
[18:25:16] <vmasto> Whirl3d: jesus you even made it better
[18:25:29] <Whirl3d> Gnarf gets the credit.
[18:25:31] <phed__> vmasto: right, sounds good.
[18:25:34] <vmasto> Whirl3d: You ruined my next step, but I love you anyway :))
[18:25:35] <gnarf> phed__: why not <a href="#article-id"> ??
[18:25:52] <Whirl3d> vmasto, your next step?
[18:26:12] <vmasto> Whirl3d: yes I mean what I was going to code next:) (look a bit more realistic :) )
[18:26:13] <phed__> gnarf: ah, perhaps better. i am finally getting used to stringmangling so ;)
[18:26:24] <gnarf> hrm
[18:27:38] <Whirl3d> vmasto, you can change the coefficient for T to make it speed up and slow down. I just made it so the bars take more time to animate if they are longer.
[18:27:55] <bkvb> This kinda sucks: http://jsfiddle.net/Tyems/
[18:28:17] <bkvb> if you enter a key, it's always one keystroke behind
[18:28:30] <bkvb> Is there anyway around that?
[18:29:08] <chaw> is there any way to pass in a variable to object.blur(function(){ ?
[18:29:11] <polarbear4> i have a .live('mousedown',function(){}); on a class. how can i remove that?
[18:29:23] <chaw> i.e. if I already have an object selected
[18:29:53] <bkvb> chaw: pass a variable to the event handler?
[18:30:24] <phed__> but second question, which relates. i have the page "article.html", what's a reasonable way to pass parameters to it? "article.html#nattmand"?
[18:30:39] <phed__> and will that get caught on google?
[18:30:41] <devil2005> could somone tell me what is wrong with this? the effect isnt running
[18:30:42] <devil2005> var options = {};$("div#adduserfrm").hide('explode',options,1000);
[18:31:16] <bkvb> chaw: you could just use a closure if i understand correctly
[18:31:17] <macheleon> polarbear4: .die()
[18:31:28] <vmasto> Whirl3d: damn, your code is so much smarter
[18:31:33] <gnarf> Whirl3d: / vmasto http://jsfiddle.net/pXcpX/13/
[18:32:28] <polarbear4> macheleon, will that prevent future binds and remove them, or just prevent future binds?
[18:32:51] <vmasto> gnarf: Whirl3d awesome, now we just need to tap into HTML5 Audio API and make it behave according to how the sound changes, rofl
[18:33:04] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/pXcpX/14/ heh - that looks kinda funky
[18:33:11] <bkvb> chaw: http://jsfiddle.net/fLphp/
[18:33:49] <macheleon> polarbear4: prevent and remove afaik, but I'm not 100% on it
[18:34:09] <daninmass> coldhead you around?
[18:34:28] <bittyx-laptop> how to get the base url of the current page? e.g if i'm on http://www.mysite.com/some/other/page i want to get the http://www.mysite.com/ part
[18:35:30] <coldhead> yes daninmass but on the world's slowest connection >: |
[18:36:17] <daninmass> im still stumped opn how to loop that animation you helped me with, my latest attempt it loaded now - dansplace.zzl.org
[18:36:22] <coldhead> bittyx-laptop: window.location.hostname
[18:36:35] <coldhead> or possibly window.location.origin
[18:37:04] <coldhead> bittyx-laptop: if you try console.log(window.location) you should be able to see all the delicious properties
[18:37:14] <bittyx-laptop> coldhead: what's the difference? i can't find anything good on google :/ yeah, i'll try that.
[18:38:31] <coldhead> daninmass: you got the link to the jsfiddle we were working on?
[18:38:37] <coldhead> it should be much simpler than what you have
[18:38:51] <daninmass> http://jsfiddle.net/4wAYG/
[18:39:19] <vmasto> phed__: http://jsfiddle.net/pXcpX/13/ a bit of skew and it looks perfect
[18:39:28] <execution> http://pastebin.com/afQiZ48k <--- gives me permutations, but i want combinations. any ideas?
[18:39:31] <daninmass> it is but I couldnt figure out another way to do it and the syntax on your if statement is weird
[18:40:36] <coldhead> the if statement just excludes {}
[18:40:49] <coldhead> which is okay if the body is just a single statement
[18:40:57] <phed__> not for me, was it vmasto?
[18:41:06] <phed__> but looks good : )
[18:41:17] <daninmass> I know, that confuses me, plus neding the entire function with an empty() confused me as well
[18:41:43] <daninmass> ao I jsut tried it the way I am familiar with
[18:42:49] <vmasto> phed__: yeah wrong link, http://jsfiddle.net/pXcpX/16/ :P
[18:43:45] <coldhead> daninmass:  http://jsfiddle.net/4wAYG/1/
[18:43:57] <coldhead> let me know if that doesn't make sense
[18:44:20] <coldhead> Brodingo: how's that look to you?
[18:44:57] <daninmass> if it's contatnly clnong wont that eventually crash th ebrowser?
[18:45:04] <daninmass> copnstantly cloning
[18:45:37] <coldhead> meh after a few days maybe
[18:45:39] <coldhead> ?tias
[18:45:40] <bot-t> Try It And See
[18:45:53] <coldhead> its not going to be too bad because it's reusing the same images
[18:45:54] <phed__> vmasto: same link :)
[18:46:53] <vmasto> it's /16/ instead of /13/
[18:46:55] <vmasto> =)
[18:47:17] <phed__> also, is there a way to do eg html = "<div>"; html.append("<div>"); ?
[18:47:28] <vmasto> but nevermind me I'm as good as braindead right now :P
[18:47:42] <phed__> heh ok
[18:50:34] <daninmass> coldhead - I changed the if to <=, looks a little smoother, but in firebug it looks liek your right, the cache size doesnt appear to be growing at all
[18:52:08] <coldhead> try IE for a couple of nights maybe :)
[18:53:01] <daninmass> I'm not under any illusiuon that peopel will stay on any page of mine for that long :)
[18:53:38] <daninmass> the thing that worries me now, is I dont really understadn why it works
[18:53:47] <coldhead> which bit?
[18:53:53] <coldhead> i tried to comment it helpfully
[18:54:11] <coldhead> you understand how it calls itself recursively?
[18:54:15] <daninmass> for example I've never seen afunction wrapped that way before (function
[18:54:29] <daninmass> or the ending ()
[18:54:34] <coldhead> that's a common javascript practice
[18:54:43] <coldhead> it makes it slightly more elegant
[18:55:12] <coldhead> um maybe this will demonstrate it well
[18:55:36] <daninmass> never even seen that done on a tutorial before. I understand the recursive part but on the flip side I dont understand how the iteration even starts I assume it has something to do with the way you wrote the function
[18:55:37] <coldhead> ?eval function foo () {alert("lol")}
[18:55:39] <bot-t> coldhead: undefined
[18:55:47] <coldhead> ?eval (function foo () {alert("lol")})()
[18:55:47] <bot-t> coldhead: "lol"
[18:56:20] <coldhead> see the first eval above just defines the function
[18:56:31] <coldhead> the second defines it and calls it immediately
[18:56:35] <execution> http://pastebin.com/Qc7XFTMB <--- why is it returning -1?
[18:56:35] <gnarf> ?iife
[18:56:36] <bot-t> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[18:56:38] <daninmass> does writing it that way basically means it fires that function as soon as the browser reads it?
[18:56:46] <coldhead> (something that returns a functon here)()
[18:56:53] <gnarf> daninmass: exactly what that means
[18:56:54] <coldhead> yes
[18:57:15] <coldhead> you COULD just define it and then call it on the next line if that's clearer to you
[18:57:21] <daninmass> probably making myself look stupid but I wont learn if I dont ask even the dumb questions :)
[18:57:24] <gnarf> ?iife @daninmass
[18:57:25] <bot-t> daninmass, http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[18:57:33] <coldhead> its not a dumb question
[18:57:42] <coldhead> it's a quirky bit of JS
[18:57:52] <coldhead> worth knowing about
[18:58:06] <abjorn> brodingo: I tried to go to AustinJS but I was like 10 minutes late and I couldn't get in, the doors to the building were locked :( what a waste of time
[18:58:33] <daninmass> one thign that bothers me is that the animation starts as soon as the page loasd, Id prefer it started X amount of time after initial page load
[18:59:12] <subsume> Given a table of calendar days, how could I select the inactive days (supposing they have an 'inactive' class)? By inactive I mean the days of the next month.
[18:59:52] <daninmass> so if that bothers me I should jsut rewrite it as the type of functiom I'm used to and set an initial timeout I would assume?
[19:00:29] <coldhead> its your site, daninmass, you should have it how you want and in a way you understand
[19:00:31] <gnarf> daninmass: use the IIFE
[19:00:37] <gnarf> its badass
[19:00:43] <gnarf> and confuses people
[19:00:49] <coldhead> lol gnarf
[19:01:02] <daninmass> gnarf, I agree but in this case I dont want my inital image to slide off the page on pageload
[19:01:06] <gnarf> i always go for maximum confusion
[19:01:30] <gnarf> gotta run - bbl
[19:01:36] <daninmass> k ty gnarf
[19:03:06] <daninmass> coldhead , this version works much better for me, I really appreciate you takign the time. I've been trying to get my employer to send me to some Jquery courses here in mass in a place called Bocoup, some of the guys from the channel are teachers there
[19:03:08] <coldhead> daninmass: http://jsfiddle.net/4wAYG/2/
[19:03:17] <coldhead> that loses the IIFE and pauses initially
[19:03:30] <coldhead> yes those guys are excellent
[19:03:40] <dsdeiz> heya! is there a jquery plugin that provides icons for zooming?
[19:03:48] <coldhead> i'd work for them in a second if they'd have me
[19:04:31] <daninmass> oh wow that's even better. self contained and you can still adjsut the initial start time
[19:04:34] <macheleon> same, if I was good enough
[19:05:09] <daninmass> well considering I started with alert('foo') 12 months ago, I've defintely improved ;)
[19:05:56] <daninmass> I've met a few of the guys there. Im in a boston php metupd group and they donate presentaion space sometimes
[19:07:07] <coldhead> oh man they'll probably have you on the payroll before the year is out
[19:07:16] <daninmass> I think I've reached the point where I can only self-teach so much. Ive been trying to play with arrays and the various timing functions lately and the logic of it all really throws me for a loop thus far
[19:08:01] <macheleon> the longest suburb name in Australia is Mamungkukumpurangkuntjunya Hill
[19:08:17] <daninmass> My employer will only reimburse me for the course they do and I dont have the cash upfront yet so I have to dpend on folks like yourself :)
[19:08:48] <coldhead> daninmass: if you want a good background the most esteemed free online javascript texts are probably: eloquent javascript, jquery fundamentals and javascript in 10 minutes
[19:09:24] <coldhead> that's a beautiful name, macheleon
[19:09:32] <coldhead> i bet it means "a drawing together of the waters"
[19:09:44] <coldhead> which dame edna says is what all aboriginal words mean
[19:09:52] <macheleon> haha
[19:10:04] <daninmass> coldhead heh. I seriously doubt those guys would need someone liek me around :). Ive actually been working at a helpdesk for the last 5 years and am moving to "jr web dev" in about 2 weeks, so I'm trying to hone the skilsl abit :)
[19:10:07] <Connorhd> it would be an impressive hill if it draws water together
[19:10:14] <macheleon> funnily enough, you're close
[19:10:20] <macheleon> "where the devil urinates"
[19:10:25] <coldhead> hahahahah
[19:10:25] <macheleon> I don't think I want to live there
[19:10:36] <FLeiXiuS> How do I create a new window Object?
[19:10:55] <FLeiXiuS> new window.Object(); ?
[19:11:08] <macheleon> grats on the move daninmass, good luck
[19:11:14] <daninmass> coldhead laughing at me or the hill joke ;)
[19:11:46] <macheleon> the hill :)
[19:11:52] <chaw> http://jsfiddle.net/MXy5D/
[19:12:11] <chaw> I am trying to avoid having to use a selector again in my .blur binding
[19:12:19] <daninmass> machelon thanks :). I did give them fair warning that my knowledge has some definite gaps but they made it cler to me they like my work thus far and that it was understood it would be a learnign position, so I really lucked out
[19:12:39] <coldhead> good luck with the job, daninmass
[19:12:39] <chaw> I already have my object selected
[19:12:51] <coldhead> you're always welcome to get help here
[19:12:52] <daninmass> I'm just eleated to get off the helpdesk. If one more nurse asks me if they should cliek on the next button I think Ill kill a kitten
[19:12:56] <chaw> and am trying to pass that selected object into another object's blur event
[19:13:11] <chaw> daninmass: I know the feeling :)
[19:13:12] <heshanh> anyone here use cufon?
[19:13:20] <coldhead> sure do, heshanh
[19:13:27] <chaw> remember the kitten had nothing to do with it
[19:13:47] <macheleon> that sounds like a fantastic opportunity that not everyone gets a shot at, daninmass
[19:13:57] <daninmass> im fairly solid on my css , had a lto of practice fixing issues becuase about 60% of the userbase still uses ie6 hhhaa
[19:14:30] <chaw> is there any way to pass in a variable to     minuteTextBox.blur(function(){variableobject.slider('value',setValue) });
[19:14:43] <chaw> rather, two variables
[19:14:48] <heshanh> cold, how do i change the font size. i did .replace("#txtA"), but i want the font to be bigger and unbold it lol
[19:15:08] <daninmass> macheleon absolutely. I'm lucky my boss listened to me whe I said hey, our helpdesk website hasnt been updated in 8 years, mind if I take a crack at it? :)
[19:15:31] <chaw> I have the two variables defined on a line below, I COULD inside there select the object again, but I already have the object and the value i need to set outside of the blur function call
[19:15:45] <daninmass> I wish I could show you guys some of the code from out intranet sites, it's horrendous
[19:16:39] <coldhead> heshanh: change it in the CSS
[19:16:46] <coldhead> that's how cufon works
[19:17:04] <heshanh> so if i assign css to textA it'll pick it up?
[19:17:11] <coldhead> hopefully!
[19:17:13] <coldhead> ?tias
[19:17:13] <bot-t> Try It And See
[19:17:41] <daninmass> thanks again coldhead now that I have it the way I was thinking in my head I can add a few more images and slow it down a bit
[19:17:42] <heshanh> lol
[19:17:55] <chaw> anyone have any idea on how to pass variableB into textbox.blur(function(){ do something with variableB here }) ?
[19:18:34] <coldhead> good luck daninmass
[19:18:41] <coldhead> check out the texts i mentioned if you have a chance
[19:18:45] <daninmass> ty sir. time to hit the rack
[19:19:32] <chaw> http://jsfiddle.net/MXy5D/ this is where I am trying to implement passing in a variable to object.blur(function(){//act on variable});
[19:19:35] <heshanh> awesome, that worked :D thank you
[19:19:44] <chaw> 1,000 dharmas for anyone who can help
[19:20:02] <Primer> Hi, is it possible to pass data into a jsonp callback?
[19:20:38] <Primer> If so, the implementation currently escapes me. Presume I don't have control over the remote end.
[19:23:11] <execution> http://pastebin.com/Qc7XFTMB <--- why is it returning -1?
[19:24:15] <coldhead> chaw: maybe you can use ?data // to associate some data with the element
[19:24:15] <bot-t> chaw, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[19:24:22] <phed__> hmmmm, is it possible to get "?blah"-stuff in JS?
[19:24:27] <phed__> from the url that is
[19:25:08] <coldhead> window.location.query i think, phed__
[19:25:38] <coldhead> no, window.location.search
[19:25:49] <coldhead> duh
[19:27:02] <coldhead> execution: maybe it's doing really string comparisons. what about if you use array literal notation like ['hi', 'bye'] ?
[19:27:16] <coldhead> really STRICT* comparison
[19:28:10] <phed__> ah thanks coldhead - evil plans -yes-
[19:29:38] <heshanh> i cant seem to unblod the text in cufon. damn
[19:30:22] <coldhead> heshanh: it might be bold in the font file itself
[19:30:35] <chaw> bot-t: and coldhead :) thank you, found it probably at the same time you sent the link
[19:30:37] <bot-t> chaw, Logs for jquery on freenode - 2009-12-04 - http://irclogs.ls-themes.org/freenode/jquery/logs/2009-12-04

[19:55:10] <dec1bel> Anyone with experience in charting libraries that can weigh in?  I've messed with flot but Highcharts looks pretty good
[19:59:48] <wesbos> dec1bel: I've only used google charts, but they are fairly easy to use. Dont look the best
[19:59:51] <execution> dec1bel: use open charts. they're free and they look better... also handle json
[20:00:27] <wesbos> I know sencha has some decent charting too
[20:01:26] <ryanseddon> http://g.raphaeljs.com/ <-- is what sencha use
[20:01:55] <wesbos> thats it
[20:03:10] <ryanseddon> it's built into Ext 4 but raphael can be used independent of js lib
[20:03:58] <dec1bel> cheers everyone
[20:04:25] <Kabong> <a title="test1title" data-value="test1" href="#">bloop</a>, <a title="test2title" data-value="test2" href="#">bleep</a> and <a title="test3title" href="#">blap</a> and I want to select based on data-value="test2", how can I do so? so far all I've figured out is: jQuery("a[data-value]]") but I can't figure out how to specify the data-value ?
[20:05:29] <Kabong> the jquery has attribute selector page doesn't show how to specify selector values --> http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
[20:05:46] <locksmithdon> Hey everyone, is _super the only change to jquery ui 1.9 core?
[20:08:00] <phed__> hmm, how can i blockformat in html/css?
[20:08:09] <locksmithdon> Kabong, it could be because that option has its own page: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[20:08:15] * phed__ is rendering stuff from an ancient book, and i'd like to preserve the typesetting
[20:09:10] <Kabong> I figured as much locksmith, but I couldn't find the page because I'm retarded! thaks!
[20:09:12] <Kabong> er thanks :)
[20:09:32] <olinux> trying to apply class to all the odd <dt> and <dd> $('.striped dt:nth-child(odd)').addClass('odd');
[20:10:01] <olinux> but but that only applies to <dt class="odd">
[20:10:12] <locksmithdon> Kabong, happy to help
[20:10:16] <olinux> $('.striped dd:nth-child(odd)').addClass('odd'); has no effect
[20:10:44] <olinux> i understand why, they are technically the "even" elements
[20:10:51] <sphinxxxx> anyone here used gallerific or slideviewerpro?
[20:11:23] <olinux> also <dt class="odd"> above is applied to all <dt> rather than every other
[20:11:35] <biodegabriel> Where can I find out what changed between jquery 1.2.6 and 1.6.1? I need to re-write a plugin and I don't know where to start.
[20:11:53] <biodegabriel> I don't want to have to read the entire history of jQ between these two versions... is there a better way?
[20:12:39] <olinux> ok this works, $('.striped dt:odd').addClass('odd');
[20:15:16] <ryanseddon> biodegabriel: a lot has changed between the versions, e.g. 1.2.6 used @ before all attribute selectors
[20:15:50] <biodegabriel> ryanseddon: yeah, i figured as much. hmmm.... i'm just not sure what approach to take in finding out why this plugin won't work with 1.6.1...
[20:16:23] <ryanseddon> load it in chrome or ff and step through your code and see where it dies
[20:16:24] <biodegabriel> it seems to fail silently.... firebug doesn't report anything.
[20:16:43] <ryanseddon> add some breakpoints
[20:17:20] <biodegabriel> OK, that's what i was attempting earlier, i'll keep at it. thanks!
[20:22:38] <locksmithdon> biodegabriel (great nick btw), I'm sure you've already seen this, but just in case: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring it might help
[20:22:40] <heshanh> cycle plugin, is there way to get 1,2,3... numbers for it some kinda of navigation
[20:24:45] <wesbos> heshanh: yeah, just pass it a selector to dump the pager numbers into
[20:25:09] <wesbos> $('#slideshow').cycle({  pager : "#nav"  });
[20:25:17] <heshanh> ah! ty
[20:25:34] <wesbos> you can build thumbnails and all kinds of stuff http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html
[20:25:58] <wesbos> here is a really simple example: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/pager-over.html
[20:26:27] <tristan-> can someone give me a hand?  i've got two sets of objects and am using index and :eq to match them up
[20:27:09] <tristan-> however i've had to break up one of the sets of objects into a series of ul, the same number of objects still exist in the selection but the index value keeps getting reset
[20:27:13] <tristan-> to 0 at each new ul
[20:28:34] <elb0w_> Whats a good drag and drop image uploader?
[20:28:34] <ryanseddon> tristan-: paste your code into a fiddle
[20:28:39] <tristan-> ok moment
[20:31:24] <wesbos> elb0w_ http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload
[20:32:58] <elb0w_> wesbos: hows jquploader?
[20:33:28] <wesbos> I've never tried it, im triyng to think of another one that I've heard good things about
[20:33:57] <elb0w_> this ones nice
[20:34:11] <elb0w_> ill use this one
[20:34:12] <elb0w_> thanks
[20:34:24] <wesbos> :)
[20:36:02] <biodegabriel> locksmithdon: thx, i'm reading it now.
[20:36:06] <phed__> yay my page works
[20:36:24] <phed__> but i'd love some advice on how to deal with the links, still :)
[20:36:26] <phed__> http://simula.gunkies.org/~phed/
[20:36:37] <phed__> it's a danish encyclopedia from 1892
[20:37:15] <phed__> so, i need it to be permalinkable, so i'd love a combination of ?'ing and #'ing :P
[20:37:33] <phed__> ah, yes, how do I get the # from an url?
[20:37:43] <phed__> it already handles direct linking with ?
[20:41:18] <elb0w_> wtf is text/x-jquery-tmpl
[20:41:24] <elb0w_> never seen this, jquery has templating now?
[20:41:41] <imjoshdean> elb0w_: Secret unicorns and rainbows
[20:42:02] * elb0w_ just had a head explode moment, been doing too much serverside
[20:42:04] <elb0w_> this is cool
[20:42:28] <imjoshdean> elb0w_: But seriously, there is a jQuery template plugin, yeah. No real mime type needed, it's whatever you want
[20:42:57] <elb0w_> thats pretty sweet
[20:43:08] <elb0w_> wesbos: this is very nice but its really heavy
[20:43:25] <imjoshdean> Yeah, it's pretty good, there are a lot of other just as good ones out there
[20:43:46] <elb0w_> yeah I just need a single file upload, ill save this one for another project
[20:44:36] <wesbos> Oh yeah, lmk what you use
[20:45:10] <elb0w_> it is really nice though
[20:45:18] <elb0w_> I just would feel bad butchering it to my needs heh
[20:45:36] <tristan-> ryan: gunna add the other bit now
[20:45:37] <tristan-> moment.
[20:47:29] <elb0w_> Anyone know any others?
[20:49:02] <Techdeck> hey guys
[20:49:21] <Techdeck> how do you change a slider's "max" value?
[20:49:25] <serio> there are girls here too, y'know
[20:50:07] <wesbos> Techdeck: you using jquery ui?
[20:50:19] <phed__> hmmm
[20:50:24] <tristan-> ryan: http://jsfiddle.net/nB8Bt/25/
[20:50:28] <serio> Techdeck: $( ".selector" ).slider( "option", "max", 7 );
[20:50:34] <phed__> i think i'll make all links "?" and then the navigation at least is at expected :\
[20:50:38] <tristan-> or anyone for that matter who'd like to assist me in explaining how to get around this problem
[20:50:40] <serio> it's in the jQuery UI docs
[20:50:41] <Techdeck> serio, thanks man!
[20:50:59] <tristan-> the index value is getting reset with each new ul
[20:51:05] <serio> you can also set it at initialization with slightly different syntax
[20:51:46] <serio> $( ".selector" ).slider({ max: 7 });
[20:52:16] <tristan-> http://jsfiddle.net/nB8Bt/29/
[20:52:57] <tristan-> temporary link 1 is supposed to trigger the 4th element of the .dot set, but it triggers 0 again.
[20:53:04] <serio> tristan-: you don't need to include jQuery in your fiddle like that
[20:53:10] <tristan-> oh i don't?
[20:53:13] <tristan-> sorry my first time using it.
[20:53:14] <serio> you can choose a framework from the left
[20:53:18] <tristan-> oh ahha
[20:53:23] <tristan-> nice.
[20:53:43] <tristan-> serio, do you see how i can get around my problem by chance?
[20:54:16] <serio> let me see.
[20:54:20] <tristan-> thanks ;)
[20:54:44] <tristan-> when i do #brandList span i get the right number in the array
[20:54:59] <tristan-> but parsing it into a set of uls is reseting the index value
[20:55:44] <ryanseddon> you getting the index relative to it's parent ul so what it's doing is correct
[20:56:14] <tristan-> so how can i make it in relation to #brandList span
[20:56:25] <tristan-> i need it to calculate it from that vantage point.
[20:57:05] <Murugaratham> is there any other way to do soap calls across domain
[20:57:10] <Murugaratham> other than jsonp?
[20:57:27] <serio> tristan-: because you're just getting the li's index() you're getting the index from all of them
[20:57:49] <serio> it doesn't change simply because it's in a separate li
[20:58:07] <serio> er, ul, rather
[20:58:13] <elb0w_> man there has to be a simple image upload
[20:58:18] <tristan-> so..
[20:58:18] <elb0w_> why do people bloat this stuff so badly
[20:58:27] <tristan-> i can't do what i'm trying to do with this markup structure?
[20:58:51] <serio> you can, but I would just link the data differently.
[20:59:12] <tristan-> how would you link them?
[20:59:39] <serio> I actually mixed up my explanation entirely.
[21:03:38] <tristan-> oh i know what to do.
[21:07:47] <serio> tristan-: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/nB8Bt/33/
[21:07:55] <serio> kind of a horrendous way to do it
[21:08:11] <serio> there's probably about 20 other ways.
[21:13:02] <tristan-> thanks serio

[21:29:13] <ezrafree> hello
[21:29:47] <ezrafree> can my url in an $ajax() call be to a remote URL? (not on the same server)
[21:30:05] <abjorn> ?sop @ ezrafree
[21:30:11] <abjorn> wtf where is bot-t
[21:30:17] <abjorn> anyways, no you can't
[21:30:21] <abjorn> same origin policy
[21:30:45] <abjorn> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[21:34:17] <djQuery>  bad bot-t
[21:36:44] <ezrafree> hmm that must be why i'm not seeing any response from my ajax request then
[21:36:53] <ezrafree> even if they are both on the same domain name?
[21:37:09] <ezrafree> one is "api.domain.com" and the other is "manage.domain.com"
[21:38:04] <abjorn> yeah, that doesn't conform to SOP
[21:38:16] <ezrafree> oh, ok
[21:38:23] <ezrafree> is there any other options available to me then?
[21:38:37] <ezrafree> any way i can run this script on a remote server somehow? in php? in jquery?
[21:39:07] <abjorn> http://www.slideshare.net/SlexAxton/breaking-the-cross-domain-barrier well there's an overview of some of the popular ones here, though most of them are pretty hacky
[21:39:40] <ezrafree> ok
[21:39:52] <ezrafree> i've got RestServer installed on the api.domain.com too
[21:39:58] <ezrafree> maybe i can just look into using that more
[21:44:06] <abjorn> but what you want is probably jsonp, ezrafree
[21:44:39] <abjorn> jquery has support for it and it's relatively simple to add support for in your server architecture
[21:44:44] <abjorn> if it doesn't already support it
[21:44:56] <ezrafree> ah cool ok
[21:45:07] <ezrafree> i will look at that then, thank you abjorn
[21:45:32] <saturdayplace> anyone used http://layout.jquery-dev.net/ ?
[21:46:19] <abjorn> ezrafree: But I should note that jsonp will only work with GET requests. So it you need post or put or something you're kinda screwed on that and will have to use some retarded hack to do it
[21:47:52] <__machine> anyone know of a better date range picker than the filament group one?
[21:48:16] <opcode> hey can anyone help me? I have a callback that's executed in a select menu. I want to programmatically change the select value, and have this same callback executed. I can change the select menu's value, but when I call the change() method on the select menu, the callback still thinks the old option is selected, I think because it gets called before the browser has had a chance to change the state of the menu
[21:48:25] <djQuery> __machine: use to jquery ui datepickers?
[21:48:40] <coldhead> that's the defacto standard, __machine
[21:48:54] <coldhead> djQuery: the filament one IS the jq UI one?
[21:48:54] <opcode> I can get it to work properly if I use the setTimeout function, but this is too fragile to use
[21:48:54] <__machine> to use with one input
[21:49:20] <djQuery> coldhead: think it has a few mods to it to be more of a range picker then just a date
[21:49:51] <coldhead> i defer to your superior wisdom and get myself another beer
[21:50:47] <__machine> the filament group one is modified a bit... but seems to be not updated in a while... and i find it to be overkill... a huge popup with all these options when i only need date range... and for some reason the styles are messed up... too big... their solution is to make body 62.5% which is equal to 10px... but that will screw up the rest of my page...
[21:51:40] <djQuery> __machine: you could just apply the class to just the date picker.
[21:52:01] <abjorn> oh, ezrafree, I just remembered. lol so you basically just need to make a ajax request to a different subdomain?
[21:52:06] <djQuery> ui-datepicker would be the css you would want to mod
[21:52:15] <abjorn> you can do document.domain = "api.whatever.com";
[21:52:21] <djQuery> saturdayplace: yes
[21:53:34] <saturdayplace> djQuery: What's your opinion of it?
[21:53:52] <djQuery> saturdayplace: kinda heavy
[21:54:18] <saturdayplace> any suggestions for alternatives?
[21:55:01] <djQuery> saturdayplace: not as pretty http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/LJV6T/
[21:55:28] <djQuery> no fancy callbacks and not even a plugin realy
[21:57:18] <saturdayplace> Hm.  Maybe it's worth just building what I want.  Would def be much lighter.
[21:57:30] <djQuery> saturdayplace: but if you realy need all the bells and whistles the other one is good
[21:58:18] <saturdayplace> I really don't need much.  Just way to have panels re-size in relation to their neighbors.
[21:59:14] <__machine> djQuery: ok i fixed the font size... but when the filament group daterangerpicker is clicked first just a menu comes up... and if the input is near the edge of the page... when i expand the range option it expands out and then drops down beneath the menu... ugly and huge...
[21:59:16] <BG> can I attach an event listener to a frame (same domain)?
[22:00:06] <djQuery> __machine: I would imagine that they arent using the jquery.ui.position then
[22:00:20] <djQuery> ?.ui.position
[22:00:29] <djQuery> damn it bot-t
[22:02:18] <__machine> its positioned under the input fine... but because it has expandable options some show one picker some two... its width is variable... and if the expanded view is too big, it doesnt behave nicely...
[22:06:21] <djQuery> __machine: each of the options should use postion internaly as well, the jquery.ui.position has colision detection built in to prevent running off the screen
[22:07:58] <djQuery> now that I reread it it sounds like it is usingthe position correctly
[22:08:17] <__machine> it doesnt go off the screen... it moves down underneath the menu... but ideally it should be coming out to the left instead of the right if theres not enough room on the right
[22:09:23] <djQuery> __machine: I think? they are going to be reworking the position plugin in 1.9 because of issues seen in the new menu plugin
[22:09:35] <djQuery> I THINK
[22:10:27] <__machine> djQuery: but the filament daterangepicker is already only build for jquery ui 1.7 ... its already out of date anyway, right?
[22:10:38] <jferg> evening all
[22:11:08] <jferg> working on a jquery script that needs to be created using some php variables
[22:11:22] <jferg> the script works when I put it into console on firebug but won't trigger when I just load it in the page
[22:11:24] <djQuery> __machine: if it inherits form datepicker it would get any fixes that get applied to datepicker. it would only need to worry about its bugs
[22:11:34] <jferg> tried w/ and without a document ready block
[22:11:50] <jferg> any thoughts?
[22:11:56] <djQuery> jferg: link?
[22:12:11] <jferg> http://www.grokadelic.com
[22:12:24] <jferg> click signin in the header
[22:12:41] <jferg> trying to create a link in the colorbox that comes up
[22:13:37] <jferg> using the script just under the div#header_welcome
[22:14:03] <djQuery> jferg: have you opened console on that ? Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null
[22:14:23] <jferg> ah yeah - that's unrelated;  I guess it could be causing an issue though eh?
[22:14:51] <djQuery> jferg: talk about heavy froze up my machine for a few secs loading it on chrome. 4 core 32 gig ram
[22:15:14] <jferg> lol yeah those share iframes + fb like boxes
[22:15:31] <jferg> add in a bunch of ads that are only half loading
[22:15:32] <jferg> 8)
[22:15:43] <jferg> optimization still to come on speed
[22:17:03] <djQuery> jferg: well cant sign in to test for you as I aint go a facebook
[22:18:30] <jferg> --> the fb login is actually working properly
[22:18:34] <da-beginner> hi all.. how do i perform $.getJSON to retrieve a cross-domain content and spit it out?
[22:18:42] <jferg> what I'm trying to do is create a link to a twitter login
[22:19:07] <jferg> the main thing is that my html() function is just not triggering for some reason
[22:19:22] <coldhead> da-beginner: you can't
[22:19:37] <coldhead> at best you can use a server side proxy
[22:19:49] <da-beginner> coldhead: not even with jsonp?
[22:20:03] <djQuery> da-beginner: only with jsonp
[22:20:08] <coldhead> you can with jsonp provided the remote domain supports it
[22:20:26] <coldhead> its not just content scraping
[22:21:55] <wesbos> da-beginner: if they dont provide jsonp you can check out this which uses jsonp http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/cross-domain-requests-with-jquery/
[22:22:04] <wesbos> sorry, it uses YQL, not jsonp
[22:22:24] <da-beginner> ok.. so the page i query needs to have jsonp support?
[22:22:27] <Murugaratham> can any1 help me with cross domain ajax calls
[22:22:38] <Murugaratham> the webservice doesnt support jsonp
[22:22:58] <da-beginner> i just want to open a content inside a lightbox... like an iframe of sort
[22:23:04] <Cork> Murugaratham: if so then your out of luck
[22:23:08] <wesbos> Murugaratham: pretty sure da-beginner just asked that, scroll up
[22:23:11] <coldhead> you're*
[22:23:57] <jferg> was worth a shot thanks guys
[22:24:52] <da-beginner> so YQL is the only way to do it?
[22:25:05] <da-beginner> (besides the other domain supporting jsonp, of course)
[22:25:12] <Murugaratham> making a proxy works?
[22:25:56] <wesbos> you could use a serverside curl scrape, but thats essentially what yql does
[22:26:23] <wesbos> because of the same origin policy you wont be able to do it with straight up JS unless they support jsonp
[22:27:59] <da-beginner> ok thanks
[22:31:17] <coldhead> so who is looking forward to the rapture
[22:32:10] <da-beginner> coldhead: next week isnt it?
[22:32:20] <macheleon> oh crap yeah that's real soon
[22:32:34] <macheleon> man I'm not going to get serious sam finished in time
[22:32:48] <da-beginner> so you all know now why i try to make this cross-domain thing working
[22:32:48] <lilis> can i help me?
[22:33:19] <Cork> lilis: not before you ask your question
[22:33:20] <da-beginner> i want to be able to connect from heaven to earth -- this way, i dont have to pack up
[22:33:35] <da-beginner> Cork: i think she wants to help herself :)
[22:33:48] <Cork> heh
[22:33:58] <lilis> Cork:  sorry ,
[22:36:40] <lilis> Cork:  i  want to compare 1 array with other and after get the value that there aren't in the fist array\
[22:40:31] <Cork> lilis: $.grep(arr1, function(val) { return $.inArray(val, arr2); });
[22:47:39] <da-beginner> so.. just to make sure...
[22:48:02] <da-beginner> i cannot use getJSON method with datatype html to obtain an html page i can display in my lightbox?
[22:48:48] <wesbos> da-beginner: nope, not unless its on your own server
[22:48:58] <da-beginner> ok thanks
[22:49:36] <Cork> lilis: did you get that?
[22:49:50] <lilis> Cork:  no :S
[22:49:55] <oninoshiko> I'm trying to get a script to load and bind activate on click when I press some buttons. It looks like they kinda work the first time, but then they dont work
[22:50:07] <oninoshiko> Any ideas on what would cause that behavior?
[22:50:09] <Cork> lilis: $.grep(arr1, function(val) { return $.inArray(val, arr2) != -1; });
[22:50:18] <lilis> Cork:  i dont inderstand
[22:50:28] <Cork> lilis: that will give you a list of the arrays from arr1 that exist in arr2
[22:50:41] <Cork> (did an error correction from the first example)
[22:51:02] <Cork> lilis: it loops through the first array and does a lookup in the second one for each value
[22:51:26] <oninoshiko> hrm.. wait... it is partally working...
[22:51:37] <Cork> lilis: if that value exist (inArray returns an index) the value is kept
[22:51:47] <Cork> if not its droped
[22:53:48] <Escherial> hey, anyone happen to know how to use the jquery validation plugin (i.e. this one http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation) to use ajax? i'm trying to see if an email the user entered is unique
[22:54:06] <Escherial> (and yes, i realize i'll have to write another page that, given some email, returns whether or not it's unique)
[22:54:38] <lilis> Cork:  did  you see my code?
[22:55:40] <Cork> lilis: don't think you've linked any code no
[23:01:14] <Escherial> i'm apparently crazy for expecting to be able to use the validation plugin to validate a value against the result of an ajax request
[23:03:23] <Escherial> aha, never mind, got it
[23:04:37] <Emn1ty> anyone got a good lightbox that allows me to add in a custom HTML5 player?
[23:15:23] <phed__> In css, is it possible to define a class where the first few lines will have some spacing?
[23:15:36] <phed__> err the first line of text will have some initial spacing?
[23:20:05] <juha___> i'm having the same coffee as i had monday, but it doesn't taste as magical
[23:20:45] <macheleon> perhaps because it's cold now
[23:21:28] <sphinxxxx> i have a link to a div within the page
[23:21:31] <coldhead> all drugs are better on mondays
[23:21:43] <sphinxxxx> instead of going there instantly, how can i set a smooth scroll using the scrollto plugin?
[23:22:12] <sphinxxxx> or is there an easy way to make all linking of that kind smooth scrolling?
[23:22:16] <Trisox> http://i.fokzine.net/upload/11/05/110517_66470_vwbustent.jpg lol
[23:22:29] <coldhead> sphinxxxx: have you looked at the documentation for scrollto?
[23:22:41] <sphinxxxx> ah i see localscroll is what i need i believe
[23:22:48] <coldhead> it's full of examples of how to do smooth scrolling
[23:23:37] <coldhead> localscrol will do, too, good work
[23:25:46] <hefox> Hiya, before I furstrate myself by trying something that doesn't work does [type=checkbox,radio] work or rather, easy way to say checkbox or radio?
[23:27:18] <coldhead> it would be nice if :radio or :checkbox worked
[23:27:57] <sphinxxxx> hmm not working for me
[23:28:24] <coldhead> ?p @ sphinxxxx
[23:28:47] <coldhead> hefox: try ':checkbox,:radio'
[23:29:19] <hefox> hm it's at the end of some other selectors, i'd have to repeat those selectors wouldn't i?
[23:29:33] <hefox> [type=checkbox] works fine for me (is there a performance difference)?
[23:30:35] <Cork> hefox: [type] is normally faster then : selectors
[23:30:39] <Cork> even if its not by much
[23:31:11] <Cork> the downside is that its a bit harder to read the selector
[23:31:50] <hefox> Coo, thanks, then I'll stick to [type then, but to confirm, I'll have to repeat the selectors if I want <selectors> [type=checkbox], <same selectors> [type=checkbox], ya?
[23:32:41] <Cork> what?
[23:32:53] <Cork> if the selector is the same theres no need to repeat it
[23:35:34] <hefox> <selectors> [type=checkbox], [type=radio] means <selectors> then checkbox or all radio items, right?
[23:36:28] <hefox> To rephase, I have the same selectors up to the point where need to say checkbox or radio, and wondering if there's a way to combine that 'checkbox or radio'
[23:37:48] <Cork> hefox: no if you want to select all checkbox and all radio types
[23:38:03] <Cork> you need to repeat the <selectors> after each comma
[23:38:16] <Cork> <selectors> [type=checkbox], <selectors> [type=radio]
[23:38:37] <hefox> figured, I was trying to see if there was a way to avoid that repeatation
[23:38:58] <Cork> you could split it out in its own filter call
[23:39:23] <Cork> $('<selector> input').filter('[type=checkbox], [type=radio]')
[23:40:00] <hefox> hm, good idea, but got a some other different selectors also XD but thanks for the idea
[23:51:35] <lisak> what does this mean $.ajaxSettings  ?  $.
[23:51:41] <lisak> the dot
[23:52:31] <Cork> lisak: that line looks incomplete
[23:52:32] <phrearch> lisak: means that ajaxSettings is a property of $ ?
[23:52:39] <mello> how do i select or unselect a radiobutton? attr('checked','checked') doesn't seem to do anything
[23:53:13] <Cork> ah, heh wasn't an inline if :P
[23:53:14] <mello> neither does attr('checked',true)
[23:53:18] <coldhead> lisak: the dot just means that ajaxSettings is a property or method of $
[23:53:37] <coldhead> ?eval typeof $.ajaxSettings
[23:53:57] <Cork> no bot :)
[23:53:58] <coldhead> bot-t?
[23:54:02] <coldhead> LITTLE bUDY?
[23:54:08] * coldhead panics
[23:54:10] <Cork> its been more off line then on line latly
[23:54:29] <lisak> ok, thanks, I just that I don't see $ to be populated with it anywhere, so I got suspicion it could be something else :)
[23:54:51] <Cork> lisak: $ is just a short hand for jQuery
[23:55:03] <Cork> and its the object everything jquery related is attached to
[23:55:50] <lisak> Cork, if you look at this https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/jquery.fileupload.js
[23:56:36] <Cork> lisak: what about it?
[23:56:42] <lisak> and search for ajaxSettings, the variable is not populated anywhere
[23:56:57] <lisak> $.ajaxSettings.xhr()  it is just used
[23:57:40] <lisak> there are no other files needed
[23:58:14] <stan_man_can> i'm trying to use the .change() event on a text box but it's not registering until i take the focus off the box
[23:58:20] <stan_man_can> anyway to make it fire on each keypress?
[23:59:30] <lisak> Cork, I see, it's part of jQuery initialization
[23:59:42] <Cork> Lisimba: its internal to jqeury
