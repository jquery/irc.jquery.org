[00:02:42] <BinaryKitten> prefixed you don't
[00:02:54] <BinaryKitten> you load Version A, no Conflict it
[00:02:58] <BinaryKitten> then load version B
[00:03:05] <maja> .submit() is the way to submit any form on a page ?
[00:03:10] <BinaryKitten> usually the newer version 1st
[00:03:26] <maja> %ask .submit
[00:03:35] <NodeX> yes
[00:03:47] <NodeX> ?submit
[00:03:47] <bot-t> .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[00:03:58] <maja> yeah as i thought
[00:04:10] <maja> then home come it won't submit my a form
[00:04:42] <maja> i use 		$('#paymentGatewayForm').submit();
[00:06:29] <NodeX> pastebin your code
[00:06:44] <prefixed> BinaryKitten ok, then what do if I'm using a script that uses jquery 1.7.2 to do some stuff with a script that uses jquery 1.3.2 (in another file)?
[00:07:29] <BinaryKitten> once you noConflict 1.7.2 to a var like $jq172 = jQuery.noConflict();
[00:07:44] <BinaryKitten> then you can use $ in the 1.3.2 script
[00:07:51] <BinaryKitten> and $jq172 in the other
[00:08:28] <prefixed> but there's no way to make a call using jquery 1.3.2 in a script that normally uses 1.7.2, right?
[00:08:47] <BinaryKitten> how do you mean?
[00:09:05] <prefixed> let me tell you a story
[00:09:09] <prefixed> http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[00:09:21] <prefixed> the media players on this site use jquery 1.7.2
[00:09:26] <maja> thats prety much my code
[00:09:31] <maja> sorry but will brb
[00:09:32] <prefixed> the rest of the site uses jquery 1.3.2
[00:09:46] <BinaryKitten> right
[00:10:12] <prefixed> there is a pager at the bottom of that site that advances the page with some ajax magic
[00:10:19] <BinaryKitten> ok
[00:10:40] <BinaryKitten> the nivo slider
[00:11:09] <prefixed> I am attempting to get the media player to use a .trigger('click') method to advance the page automatically when the last media player on the page completes playing
[00:11:16] <prefixed> BinaryKitten no, farther down
[00:11:34] <prefixed> the "Older Entries >" element
[00:12:57] <BinaryKitten> right?
[00:13:04] <maja> NodeX:http://pastebin.com/1vUstXRp
[00:13:26] <BinaryKitten> prefixed so far am with you, but starting to lose the thread
[00:13:44] <BinaryKitten> have 5 more minutes before i need to hobble to the bus
[00:13:55] <maja> am making an ajax call changing a value in the form then trying to submit the form
[00:14:14] <maja> works untill the submit
[00:14:46] <prefixed> BinaryKitten basically, once the last media player on the page (the one that says jerk - darkbuster) finished playing, it should call a trigger(click) on the "older entries >" link
[00:15:06] <prefixed> BinaryKitten the trigger call is not working due to some ye unknown reason
[00:15:29] <prefixed> I am beginning to suspect that its due to conflicting versions fo jquery
[00:16:22] <prefixed> BinaryKitten do you follow?
[00:16:51] <BinaryKitten> try $('.view').find('.pager-next a').click() instead of triggerHandler
[00:17:10] <BinaryKitten> in console based tests it's finding the item
[00:17:22] <prefixed> BinaryKitten I've already gone over most of the basics. click, trigger, and triggerhandler don't work
[00:17:25] <prefixed> the console works
[00:17:39] <prefixed> and I can execute other functions on the DOM element in the code
[00:18:02] <BinaryKitten> prefixed also, check to see if those links are injected
[00:18:09] <prefixed> injected?
[00:18:16] <BinaryKitten> yep
[00:18:23] <BinaryKitten> as in not in dom at start
[00:18:31] <BinaryKitten> that might have an issue
[00:18:42] <prefixed> hm
[00:18:54] <BinaryKitten> also, finally, it's nice that you're using a closure to wrap your code,
[00:19:14] <BinaryKitten> but you don't have a dom ready in there
[00:19:35] <prefixed> oh so you are thinking that there may be an ajax click handler somewhere that isn't being called when I use .trigger()
[00:20:18] <BinaryKitten> prefixed I'm not thinking anything, just going through the debug
[00:20:42] <prefixed> ok
[00:21:00] <prefixed> that's an interesting one. I'm not clear on what you mean by "not in dom at start"
[00:21:21] <hi> hey!
[00:21:30] <BinaryKitten> ok dom at start = what is in the dom from the server
[00:22:00] <BinaryKitten> what is injected later can be created via js, loaded in via ajax etc
[00:22:10] <BinaryKitten> but they're not bindable at the start
[00:23:00] <prefixed> they are not in the DOM at start
[00:23:41] <BinaryKitten> step through and debug... as something i heard recently Dont Expect Brilliance Unless God
[00:23:54] <prefixed> that's a good one
[00:24:06] <BinaryKitten> right must go bus in 5
[00:24:16] <prefixed> I do think I may be screwed here
[00:28:47] <raj> is finding :first any better than just finding? since it just returns the first object anyway?
[00:28:50] <raj> ...or so I thought
[00:29:12] <Trisox> ◕‿◕
[00:29:36] <BinaryKitten> oh my Trisox
[00:29:39] <BinaryKitten> ltns
[00:32:32] <Trisox> hey BinaryKitten
[00:32:46] <raj> survey says?
[00:33:20] <Trisox> BinaryKitten: how is life
[00:33:45] <BinaryKitten> raj it all depends on what you're doing
[00:34:03] <BinaryKitten> sorry Trisox, been ok. Got to run (hobble) late for work
[00:34:03] <diverdude> How can i vertical align text in the middle?
[00:34:21] <Trisox> ;) got standup brb
[00:35:22] <raj> var $someelementclone = $('#someelement').clone(); would $someelementclone.parent() be the same as $('#someelement').parent() at this point?
[00:36:26] <BinaryKitten> raj no
[00:36:36] <raj> k
[00:36:47] <BinaryKitten> you're cloning it in memory and cloning the collection
[00:36:50] <raj> $someelementclone.parent() would be []
[00:36:51] <raj> ?
[00:36:58] <BinaryKitten> ?tias
[00:36:58] <bot-t> Try It And See
[00:37:25] <NodeX> $somelementclone would have no parent as it's just an opbject and doesn't exist in the DOM yet
[00:37:29] <NodeX> -p
[00:38:05] <BinaryKitten> NodeX that's where I was heading. Trying to teach through self discovery
[00:38:14] <raj> ya, doesn't work
[00:38:24] <raj> thanks NodeX  :)
[00:40:57] <NodeX> easier to explain it sometimes!
[00:41:35] <Colonel_Panic> Hey all
[00:43:08] <Colonel_Panic> I'm making a page with a number of tabsets enabled using the jquery ui. The problem is, only one set of tabs actually works
[00:43:54] <Colonel_Panic> The first set works, but the rest require a page refresh and still don't properly swap out the appropriate content divs
[00:45:36] <Colonel_Panic> This issue has been addressed a number of times on StackOverflow, but none of the solutions I've seen proposed there actually work in my situation.
[00:52:44] <scathen^C> hey guys, how would i go about removing all 'br' nodes, but only removing the first if other br's follow? (eg. text, br, text, br, br, br, text would give text, text, br, br, text)?
[00:53:58] <ryanaz> where's the best place to put global functions?   Before the $(function() { ... }  , inside, or after ?
[00:54:07] <ryanaz> or does it matter?
[00:57:37] <klawd_prime> 7/part
[01:06:10] <remp> allo.
[01:06:39] <remp> I have a little problem. I want to put a has-text and a focus class on a input and a label element.
[01:07:18] <remp> here is the code I used: http://pastebin.com/esq63106
[01:07:51] <remp> and here is the CSS: http://pastebin.com/0Br3Bcba
[01:08:29] <remp> the problem is not with the css, I used chrome's developers tools, and when I click on the input field it doesn't apply the focus class on the label.
[01:08:57] <remp> I hope you know what I mean.
[01:11:18] <remp> Btw, I'm trying to do this on a wordpress site. I have my jQuery in the functions.php and the load in the footer.
[01:18:03] <remp> So it doesn't work. And I don't know why.
[01:21:26] <tw2113> remp why do you have the jQuery in your functions file?
[01:21:55] <remp> because if I'd put it into the header it's mess with other plugins.
[01:22:09] <tw2113> mess up how?
[01:22:36] <remp> I don't know. This is what the guys told me at the wordpress channel. :)
[01:22:47] <tw2113> if you're not hooking the code onto wp_head or wp_footer, or at least an enqueued script file, i doubt the browser ever sees it
[01:22:53] <remp> It loads btw, checked.
[01:23:02] <remp> its in the footer
[01:23:12] <tw2113> live link?
[01:23:18] <remp> <script src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/_/js/functions.js"></script>
[01:23:24] <tw2113> ah
[01:23:26] <tw2113> functions.js
[01:23:31] <tw2113> i was thinking functions.php
[01:24:07] <remp> yeah theres also something in the functions.php.. :D it pulls the code from there
[01:24:24] <tw2113> wp_enqueue_script is my guess
[01:24:36] <remp> http://pastebin.com/AsHbuah1
[01:24:36] <remp> here
[01:24:37] <tw2113> maybe
[01:24:42] <remp> yeah
[01:24:57] <tw2113> ok all that's doing is loading google's jQuery
[01:25:09] <tw2113> and then after that in the footer area, you have your functions.js file linked
[01:25:54] <remp> yeah. btw I've built my theme based on the html5-reset wp theme, so it was kinda included... I just updated the link to the latest jquery
[01:26:13] <tw2113> it works
[01:26:21] <tw2113> i have no argument
[01:26:48] <remp> I guess theres something wrong with the code. At least it doesn't seem to do what it meant to :D
[01:27:07] <tw2113> dunno at this point, but i haven't seen anything in action or any console errors
[01:27:27] <remp> www.remp.me
[01:27:30] <tw2113> i spoke up mostly cause of the functions confusion
[01:27:43] <remp> click on the first post, then look at the send a comment form
[01:28:09] <remp> I'm trying to make the label disappear when you write something into it
[01:28:45] <remp> and also on to lose opacity on focus
[01:29:17] <Zhy> remp: http://fuelyourcoding.com/scripts/infield/
[01:29:43] <remp> thanks, looking at it
[01:30:44] <tw2113> personally, i'd probably just use the html5 placeholder property
[01:31:10] <tw2113> and then something like modernizr to test for placeholder support, and use jQuery to handle text for browsers that lack support
[01:31:42] <Whirl3d> how do you collapse a collapsible tab in jquery UI?
[01:31:50] <Whirl3d> other than clicking on it.
[01:33:24] <tw2113> remp also looking at that functions.js, you're missing the closing }); for your .ready() function
[01:35:16] <remp> thanks
[01:35:18] <remp> corrected
[01:35:21] <remp> still doesn't work.. XD
[01:35:51] <tw2113> Event.observe is not a function
[01:40:52] <fourlastor> hello everyone :)
[01:41:30] <fourlastor> how does jquery implements the animation? does it use internally css animations when possible?
[01:43:14] <Whirl3d> you need a jquery plugin like jquery transitions to use the built-in css transforms/animations
[01:44:44] <remp> tw2113 what should I use instead of the event.observe? btw I found this code at:
[01:44:58] <remp> http://www.zurb.com/playground/inline-form-labels
[01:55:25] <prefixed> wtf does this mean: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'handleErrors'
[01:55:47] <remp> lol... fixed it
[01:56:00] <remp> simply replaced Event.observe with blur
[01:56:21] <remp> thanks tw2113 :D
[01:57:51] <ryanaz> ... so I want a really cool animation for when I append a <tr></tr> row to a table, like the <tr> flys in from out of view.. is there a function i should look at to pull this off ?
[02:00:50] <diverdude> Anybody knows if it is possible to import a directory with all sub-files and directories in LESS?
[02:02:49] <Whirl3d> is that a jquery question?
[02:03:07] <ryanaz> Whirl3d: mine is.  :)
[02:03:10] <ryanaz> ... so I want a really cool animation for when I append a <tr></tr> row to a table, like the <tr> flys in from out of view.. is there a function i should look at to pull this off ?
[02:03:24] <ifoundwaldo> Is there a query method to search by an attribute value?
[02:03:29] <Whirl3d> do you have an example of where you have seen this before?
[02:03:39] <Whirl3d> ifoundwaldo, yes.
[02:03:52] <Whirl3d> $("[attribute='value']");
[02:04:02] <ryanaz> Whirl3d:  in my head...
[02:04:30] <Whirl3d> but you should lookup in the api. there are lots of version. like ~= or *= that might be even better than just =
[02:05:01] <Whirl3d> ryanaz, you are likely gonna have to use .animate and depending on the complexity, it could be a real pain in the ass.
[02:05:10] <Whirl3d> considering it's a table and all
[02:05:24] <Whirl3d> you will probably have to simulate a tr before it gets added
[02:06:05] <ifoundwaldo> How would i concatenate a variable in for the value
[02:06:28] <ifoundwaldo> var title = $(e.target).html();
[02:06:28] <ifoundwaldo> console.log($([name='title'])); ?
[02:06:37] <Whirl3d> $("[name='"+value+"']");
[02:06:56] <subdesign> why is that, if I have a general js file (with small js code snippets), and putting a snippet at the end, doesnt work. putting at the beginning, works. ?
[02:07:43] <Whirl3d> subdesign, tell me how long is this piece of string I am holding and I'll tell you the answer to your extremely difficult to predict question.
[02:07:44] <ryanaz> Whirl3d:  I wonder if it would be easier to just create entirely new <table><tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr></table> ...
[02:07:46] <ifoundwaldo> Thanks a bunch!
[02:07:51] <Whirl3d> np
[02:08:00] <ryanaz> Whirl3d: and just stack them somehow
[02:08:12] <Whirl3d> might work.
[02:08:34] <subdesign> Whirl3d, I just need a theoretical answer I'm just curious
[02:08:35] <ifoundwaldo> now could I do a !=
[02:08:35] <ryanaz> Whirl3d: if i use the same column widths and stuff they should match up
[02:08:50] <ifoundwaldo> for all values that don't equal my title variable
[02:09:06] <Whirl3d> I was trying to demonstrate the notion that your problem is really specific to the details of your implementation which we know nothing about.
[02:09:26] <ifoundwaldo> was that to me?
[02:09:34] <ryanaz> Subdesign:  Maybe you're not closing a function correclty somewhere?   an open ) ( {  }  ?
[02:09:49] <ryanaz> subdesign: could be anything really
[02:09:55] <Whirl3d> ifoundwaldo, no. But remember when I said you should lookup the api cause there are a lot of great comparators to use...do it.
[02:10:43] <subdesign> ryanaz, right
[02:10:51] <Whirl3d> subdesign, and the problem is the 98% of the time, we try to guess this sort of thing and someone missed a closing markup tag or something.
[02:12:02] <Whirl3d> ifoundwaldo, did you find the comparator you were looking for....I think it's ^=  but I'm not sure... I'd have to look it up
[02:12:31] <Whirl3d> lol it is !=
[02:12:38] <ryanaz> Whirl3d:   A question I asked earlier, for "global functions" that you want available everywhere, does it matter if the function is placed inside the $(function() { ... }  or before, or after?
[02:13:05] <ryanaz> is there a specific execution declaration order of operations or anything like that?
[02:13:35] <Whirl3d> presumably you don't want to put it after since the code that will use it will likely be inside the function...but it doesn't matter really. I think that it gets loaded in the header before the main function runs.
[02:13:39] <subdesign> Whirl3d, agree totally
[02:14:30] <ryanaz> Whirl3d:  that's what my experience is, but I wasn't sure if I was just missing something....
[02:15:02] <ryanaz> I always hated in C how I had to define functions before the function is called.... seemed lame
[02:15:04] <Whirl3d> I prefer to keep my globals in front of my execution...
[02:15:09] <subdesign> in my case, lest imagine have small snippets like $('.class').tooltip(); and so on, and putting this from end to the start suddenly started to work. strange for me.
[02:15:11] <ryanaz> Whirl3d:  I do too..
[02:15:22] <Whirl3d> jslint will call you out on that, mind you.
[02:22:34] <ryanaz> coffee, redbull, monster, amp ?
[02:23:16] <ryanaz> guess we could put mountain dew in the poll as well
[02:28:26] <Whirl3d> methamphetamine, cocaine, modafinil
[02:28:45] <Trisox> :)
[02:28:55] <alaing> Hi how do I create an empty jquery object which I can then use .add()
[02:29:29] <Whirl3d> All of which, according the legal references on illicit drugs, have significantly fewer side effects than caffeine...fyi
[02:29:55] <Whirl3d> $()
[02:31:05] <coder2> how can i take values from a form and save it in my sqllite database?
[02:32:59] <alaing> Whirl3d: I tried that but when I console log i still get $() after using .add()
[02:33:41] <alaing> I'm adding a jquery object
[02:37:33] <coder2> how can i take values from a form and save it in my sqllite database?
[02:38:00] <alaing> And this is why it will not work http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9055
[02:38:30] <alaing> coder2: do you want ot use ajax or submit the page?
[02:39:55] <coder2> i am developing a sample app which stores values in database on clicking SUBMIT
[02:40:31] <coder2> so whats the difference is there in between two u specified?
[02:41:14] <alaing> Ok but do you what to submit the page (i.e refresh the page and display a save page) or use ajax (i.e not refresh the page but just show a "success message" on the page)
[02:41:44] <javex0> in HTML5 input there is pattern="regex" attribute and you can check that with in css with :valid / :invalid pseudo class. Is there any way to interact with it within jQuery? I can't seem to find anything on it, but I have a hard time believing jquery does not support this
[02:41:45] <alaing> one submits the page i.e the page refreshs or branches off to another page
[02:43:39] <coder2> submit the page
[02:43:59] <alaing> Then you dont need jquery for that
[02:44:28] <Whirl3d> so we are not supposed to jack up the jquery namespace when adding plugins, but is it considered bad form to use $.fn.mycode.myfunc1 and $.fn.mycode.myfunc2 to expose methods for use by a plugin that is $.fn.mycode
[02:45:24] <coder2> then how we can implement?
[02:45:30] <alaing> Whirl3d: I'm not sure although I would use jQuery instead of $
[02:45:59] <alaing> coder2: what server side scripting language are you using....i.e php, asp.net etc
[02:46:57] <coder2> its on mobile not anywhere else till now so no php or asp
[02:47:12] <alaing> coder2: best you look up html form actions and page processing.
[02:47:24] <alaing> coder2: do you know what jquery is?
[02:48:00] <coder2> nope, tell me
[02:48:57] <alaing> coder2: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+jquery
[02:49:34] <coder2> cool!!
[02:50:02] <alaing> now you know
[02:50:15] <coder2> okay boss
[02:50:35] <alaing> coder2: jquery.com is also a good source of info
[02:50:57] * alaing is no ones boss
[02:51:00] <coder2> okay thanku
[03:12:20] <diverdude> How can i implement a css class defined like this: #Profiles #view .ladida {}   ?
[03:14:36] <codeAssassin> @diverdude its an element with an id Profiles, then a child with id view, then a child element with class ladida
[03:16:08] <diverdude> codeAssassin: so i really need that structure in order to do it?
[03:16:29] <codeAssassin> @diverdude what's the purpose
[03:16:46] <diverdude> codeAssassin:  i was hoping i could do something like <div class="#Profiles #view .ladida"></div>
[03:17:25] <diverdude> codeAssassin: its because i am trying to utilize the namespace feature in LESS CSS as described here: http://lesscss.org/
[03:17:41] <diverdude> codeAssassin: but problem is that i dont want to create these element hierachies
[03:19:23] <codeAssassin> diverdude: are you actually using less css ?
[03:19:29] <diverdude> codeAssassin: yeah
[03:21:09] <diverdude> codeAssassin: they dont provide an example of how to use the namespace :(
[03:24:07] <codeAssassin> yeah lol i noticed
[03:24:18] <codeAssassin> this doesn't actually have anything to do with jquery though
[03:24:52] <codeAssassin> #something applies to the ID of an element where .something applies to the class
[03:25:04] <codeAssassin> i think thats causing some confusion
[03:25:14] <diverdude> codeAssassin: yeah...i just dont understand the purpose of those namespaces in LESS then :/
[03:27:37] <codeAssassin> just look at the compiled result and work from there, i really don't know what else to say lol
[03:29:58] <diverdude> codeAssassin: yeah thats what i did...the compiled output produces that css: #Profiles #view .ladida {}
[03:32:45] <codeAssassin> diverdude: sorry bro http://jsfiddle.net/s2ZN7/1/
[03:33:26] <codeAssassin> i guess i'm failing to see the use of it as well
[03:34:53] <codeAssassin> people always want solutions for their problems instead of accepting that something is flawed
[03:37:33] <diverdude> codeAssassin: hmmm but i just got myself an idea. I could just wrap all my pages in 2 spans called #Profiles and #view (those names are dynamically changed depending on page requested), and then the "namespace would be valid...like this: http://jsfiddle.net/s2ZN7/2/
[03:37:41] <diverdude> codeAssassin: dont you think that would work?
[03:38:08] <diverdude> codeAssassin: because it seems that the elements does not have to be direct decendents
[03:38:34] <diverdude> codeAssassin: as long as they are just decending at some poing
[03:38:36] <diverdude> point
[03:40:26] <codeAssassin> could you whip up an example with that fiddle? like loading less.js in there?
[03:41:19] <codeAssassin> i loaded it in for you
[03:41:20] <codeAssassin> http://jsfiddle.net/s2ZN7/3/
[03:42:41] <diverdude> codeAssassin: well its already that one basically
[03:43:07] <diverdude> so imagine <div id="Profiles"> is changed with <div id="Images"> if another controller is requested
[03:43:12] <codeAssassin> yeah but with the namespace code in there
[03:43:23] <codeAssassin> or do you load it in from node.js or something ?
[03:43:46] <diverdude> codeAssassin: ahh the LESS code you mean?
[03:43:51] <codeAssassin> yeah
[03:43:59] <diverdude> codeAssassin: its being parsed on the server
[03:44:05] <codeAssassin> by node?
[03:44:06] <diverdude> codeAssassin: i have a php parser
[03:44:12] <codeAssassin> ooh phpless
[03:44:14] <codeAssassin> ?
[03:44:19] <diverdude> codeAssassin: phpless
[03:44:29] <codeAssassin> lessphp
[03:44:32] <diverdude> i guess there is also a node parser...im using the phpless
[03:44:32] <codeAssassin> i was close
[03:44:54] <diverdude> im using a plugin for cakephp, which uses lessphp
[03:45:09] <codeAssassin> http://leafo.net/lessphp/ paste your code on  a pastebin, and let me compile it
[03:45:54] <diverdude> codeAssassin: i think its gonna work...its a nice idea. I can probably also use it to organize my js files somehow
[03:46:54] <codeAssassin> i sorta created a private discussion
[03:47:30] <Whirl3d> so when using prototypical inheritence, the only way that the prototype methods will show up as methods of some object is if you override the prototype method...is that correct?

[04:15:20] <bibi23> hi, I'm using jquery ui multiple autocompleter (http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple), with a source having a label and a value, so I don't want to submit th labels written in the textbox but their associated values, so I have a hidden field wich is populated when a new choice is clicked with autocompleter, but I don't know how to handle the case when the user deletes a value...
[04:15:22] <bibi23> ...from the textbox, did someone already did this in here? thx

[04:32:26] <jakoch> hey, is it possible to trigger opening a txt file with notepad by onclick?
[04:35:28] <zoite> I don't think you can specify the program to use
[04:36:54] <firedfox> it violates security rules
[04:40:59] <fgro> i'm catching the submit event of a form. within the callback function, "this" references the form object. How can I retrieve the url the form is sent to? "this.attr('action')" won't do it for me. Thanks.
[04:44:21] <IfSixWasNine> hello, i found that inside the jquery-docu: The type of request to make ("POST" or "GET"), default is "GET". Note: Other HTTP request methods, such as PUT and DELETE, can also be used here, but they are not supported by all browsers.
[04:44:52] <IfSixWasNine> doesn't jquery check if my browser supports these methods otherwise add ?_method=DELETE to the request?
[04:45:32] <bibi23> I've made a jsfiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/cbrbS/ , how can I update the hidden field when something is deleted from the text field? thx
[04:46:56] <riskyshenanigan> how do i prevent a nav bar shifting when a page has a overflow?
[04:47:42] <Whirl3d> position:fixed
[04:48:33] <DeltaHeavy> riskyshenanigan: I'd try putting 'overflow: hidden;' on the 'body' and/or 'html' elements.
[04:49:09] <riskyshenanigan> i still want overflow on the pages where content is more, but prevent the nav from shifting on those pages
[04:51:06] <DeltaHeavy> riskyshenaniagan: If it's the vertical scroll bar in the 'html' tag set height to 101% so it's always there
[04:51:39] <pachet> :[
[04:51:45] <pachet> position:fixed is so much cleaner
[04:51:52] <pachet> and that's what its for

[04:59:43] <jeffsmykil> Morning folks
[05:01:31] <Whirl3d> what is the method signature for instanceOf....I have looked it up and it seems like there are dozens of differing opinions.
[05:03:26] <Whirl3d> I tried:  if (options instanceOf Object && item.update)  but it says unexpected identifier
[05:03:48] <pachet> er, dont you mean 'instanceof'
[05:03:58] <pachet> all lower case ( and yeah, im not sure why its not camelcase either )
[05:04:40] <Whirl3d> wow. that is hilarious. Thanks pachet.
[05:07:10] <pachet> Whirl3d: if you're still interested in how instanceof is implemented internally: http://es5.github.com/#x11.8.6
[05:08:20] <shoky> "The instanceof operator tests whether an object has in its prototype chain the prototype property of a constructor" is simpler and more informative, no? :P
[05:09:29] <scathen^C> hey how do i check if $(this) is a <br>??
[05:09:29] <Whirl3d> but why the weird signature?
[05:10:02] <pachet> shoky: of course, but that doesnt speak to how the engine actually implements it
[05:10:15] <pachet> Whirl3d: weird signature?
[05:10:41] <Whirl3d> scathen^C, if ($(this).is("br")) { do stuff}
[05:10:50] <shoky> well neither does the spec, to me personally ;P
[05:11:06] <Whirl3d> I would think it would be variablename.instanceOf("string") for example
[05:11:19] <pachet> its an operator, not a method
[05:11:24] <pachet> think of the operator >
[05:11:27] <shoky> there's isPrototypeOf
[05:11:34] <pachet> left hand comparison   >   right hand comparison
[05:11:38] <pachet> produces boolean result
[05:11:40] <scathen^C> whirl3d: thanks
[05:11:50] <pachet> left hand comparison  instanceof   right hand comparison
[05:11:54] <pachet> also yields boolean result
[05:12:40] <Whirl3d> pachet, that is the single best description of the situation I have ever heard. It makes a lot more sense
[05:12:54] <Whirl3d> They should make it a symbol for my convenience...
[05:12:56] <greg_f> I have such example http://jsfiddle.net/KGBCq/3/, but when I click on the link my page jumps to the top, why? return false doesn't work?
[05:12:58] <Whirl3d> lol
[05:13:01] <pachet> Whirl3d: heh
[05:13:45] <shoky> greg_f: in the fiddle there's Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function
[05:13:54] <shoky> but that prolly wouldn't happen outside fiddle
[05:15:20] <shoky> er also what's .test()  :P
[05:15:28] <AdvoWork> I've just hit a problem, i've got a php file on one of my internal servers, i access it via: http://192.168.0.88/test/test.php which works fine. I'm doing an ajax request to pull this information and am getting: XMLHttpRequest cannot load is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. Any suggestions what I can do please?
[05:16:04] <otherj> ignored.
[05:16:30] <AdvoWork> header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'); stops the error, but is there another way?
[05:16:46] <pachet> greg_f: you're already using jquery
[05:16:52] <pachet> why on earth would you resort to inline event handlers
[05:17:00] <pachet> for your consideration : http://jsfiddle.net/XVav5/
[05:17:04] <Whirl3d> AdvoWork, make sure your url for the ajax has the same domain...192...etc.
[05:17:15] <shoky> greg_f: http://jsfiddle.net/KGBCq/7/
[05:18:09] <AdvoWork> Whirl3d, it has though
[05:18:14] <shoky> oh pachet already fiddled sry
[05:18:34] <greg_f> shoky: pachet thank you!
[05:19:26] <Whirl3d> yeah, AdvoWork, without some code in a fiddle, I, for one will be of no use. sorry
[05:20:41] <rohanrhu> hi
[05:20:43] <rohanrhu> i need help
[05:21:06] <shoky> i need cash
[05:21:07] <rohanrhu> desk_link.attr('desk_id', desk['_id']);
[05:21:10] <shoky> we're a perfect match
[05:21:13] <rohanrhu> i set this
[05:21:18] <rohanrhu> after
[05:21:28] <rohanrhu> console.log($(this).attr('desk_id'));
[05:21:47] <shoky> ya but what is 'this' :\
[05:22:00] <rohanrhu> but $(this).attr('desk_id') returns undefined
[05:22:16] <shoky> ya but what is 'this' :\
[05:22:24] <rohanrhu> shoky: $('.desk_link_button').click(function () {
[05:22:37] <rohanrhu> this is from here
[05:22:42] <shoky> and what is desk_link
[05:22:56] <rohanrhu> var desk_link = $('.desk_link_prototype').clone();                 desk_link.attr('class', 'desk_link');
[05:23:18] <shoky> um
[05:23:34] <shoky> so they're not the same element..?
[05:23:44] <shoky> ?definitely @ rohanrhu
[05:23:45] <bot-t> rohanrhu, It boils down to this: if you make a (proper) jsfiddle of what you've already tried, someone will definitely (try to) help you
[05:24:16] <huntedmitch> bot-t is right. jsfiddle it, show us where you're going wrong, and people will help :-)
[05:24:44] <pachet> bot-t cannot tell a lie
[05:26:19] <rohanrhu> shoky: it solved
[05:26:22] <rohanrhu> thank you
[05:26:23] <Whirl3d> Testifyu!
[05:26:37] <huntedmitch> rohanrhu: That was all bot-t
[05:26:57] <Whirl3d> and some sweet shoky on the side...
[05:27:21] <huntedmitch> shoky, the js whisperer
[05:27:50] <shoky> l0l
[05:28:12] <huntedmitch> ;-)
[05:29:01] <shoky> Whirl3d can you explain your earlier question about prototyping ?
[05:29:53] <shoky> (if you havent figured it out by now, that is)
[05:30:32] <Billy_> ?
[05:30:37] <shoky> HELLOW
[05:30:42] <Whirl3d> I wanted to know if you created an object and then defined methods to it's prototype would those methods show up when you logged the item?
[05:30:50] <Billy_>  I have a jquery color picker i want to update the main.css  that contain a  class name .divcolor { color: #ffffff;}  with the color picker color is that possible
[05:31:00] <Billy_> ?
[05:31:10] <shoky> Whirl3d yea
[05:31:27] <Whirl3d> or do you have to explicitly override the prototype instance of the methods with the object's own methods to have it show up.
[05:32:30] <Whirl3d> because I would setup my function, prototype the methods then create a new object from the function and log it to find no methods attached to the object though they appeared in the object's prototype
[05:32:38] <shoky> ah in a console log hm
[05:33:04] <shoky> yeah you'd be able to call them but donno about seeing them in a log
[05:33:29] <shoky> well yeah you see them in a log
[05:33:36] <Whirl3d> So i figured as a matter of convenience, the only way they would show up (other then in the prototype reference in the object is if they were explicitly declared on the object
[05:33:36] <shoky> if you go up the prototype chain
[05:34:29] <shoky> for example:  function A() { }    var a = new A();     A.prototype.f = function() { console.log('f!') }
[05:35:03] <shoky> if you console.log(a) , you see an empty object, whose prototype is A
[05:35:21] <shoky> if you look at A you'll see the f function
[05:35:43] <shoky> ah you said it yourself ;P
[05:35:52] <Whirl3d> but then if you said   a.f=function () {this.prototype.f.call();}
[05:36:04] <Whirl3d> you would see it because it was explicitly declared.
[05:36:21] <shoky> "prototype" wouldn't work i thnk
[05:36:26] <shoky> i mean  "this.prototype"
[05:36:39] <shoky> umm not sure what you mean
[05:37:51] <Whirl3d> that's prolly why I see people use A.prototype._super=function (....something
[05:37:57] <shoky> ah yeah because then f would be an explicit function in the a object
[05:38:23] <shoky> a.f = something  <--- sets the f property only on this instance 'a'
[05:38:46] <shoky> A.prototype.f = something <--- sets it for any object whose prototype is A
[05:39:00] <Whirl3d> right. Then if you log(a) you will see f  whereas before you didn't (except in A)
[05:39:03] <shoky> maybe "sets" isnt the right word
[05:39:14] <shoky> right
[05:39:32] <Whirl3d> then to access the original f method, you would use this.prototype.f
[05:39:38] <Whirl3d> or is that not possible
[05:39:44] <Billy_> Guy's Asked a Question before 30 mins but didn't get any response\
[05:40:05] <shoky> mmm only function objects have the "prototype" property i think
[05:40:22] <shoky> otherwise it's an "internal" property  like __proto__ or someshit
[05:40:38] <shoky> (that part is where i start to get confused :D)
[05:41:32] <Whirl3d> Billy, don't go sounding all entitled and shit. We are all just like you...none of us is getting paid to help here. But to answer your question: yes
[05:42:00] <kosko> has anyone heard about google gmail offline, what protocol/technology do they use to sync the data?
[05:42:05] <kosko> google chrome plugin
[05:42:54] <shoky> TCP/IP i'd imagine ;S
[05:43:14] <Whirl3d> Billy, as you can tell, it's really best to create a fiddle for us to look at.
[05:43:35] <Whirl3d> You are much more likely to get folks to help in general if they have something they can view/work with
[05:46:09] <Whirl3d> So this "friend" of mine has built a really successful business of managing petsitters. He provides the system that keeps track of times and schedules, finances and such. And he's done it all in SQL with ColdFusion and basic--tragic-boring-and ugly HTML
[05:46:49] <Whirl3d> Still, he has about 400 customers that pay him around 2-300/month to keep manage their data.
[05:46:56] <pachet> small business with ugly web platform?? that's unheard of
[05:47:07] <Whirl3d> lol
[05:47:50] <Whirl3d> The thing is that he refuses to do anythig about it. Mostly because he has built this ridiculous database system with explicit fields--nothing dynamic at all.
[05:48:11] <Whirl3d> so "vacationHours1" is an actual fieldname, for example...
[05:49:35] <Whirl3d> and he stores all this data on his own servers in his house (which he has spent a fortune on--replete with redunandant power supplies and all)  Anyways, if someone wants to make a killing, his customers are about to jump the boat.

[06:06:53] <tronne> http://space.thelunarempire.net/pr/ussr.html why is the .click only functioning on the 'yes', but not the options of the selector?
[06:07:24] <shoky> thx kborchers !
[06:07:54] <IfSixWasNine> akrabat, for example i expand would like to expand the albums of your tutorial with a second table called "label" and just got a labelId added to the album-table itself, so whats the best practice to join them together? $this->select(); cant be use to join a table into a model right?
[06:09:04] <pachet> tronne: because click events arent necessarily propagated from <select>
[06:09:19] <pachet> tronne: use .on('change' --> for the select to be sure
[06:15:01] <danieldeusing> if I have an xml file containing: <part><name>bla</name><subpart><name>bla</name><moreval>blubb</moreval></subpart></part>
[06:15:02] <danieldeusing> how do I access only the name of the part group ?
[06:15:07] <danieldeusing> $(this).find('name').text() -> return blabla
[06:15:13] <danieldeusing> but I only want "bla"
[06:16:00] <danieldeusing> well in detail "find" seems to search recursive, but i dont want a recursive search but only the corresponding item search
[06:16:21] <Patabugen> danieldeusing you could use .get(0) to get just the first <name>
[06:16:36] <ecthiender> danieldeusing, can you see if this works:  $(this).find('part name').text() ?
[06:16:39] <danieldeusing> get('name') will also work ?
[06:16:49] <Patabugen> ah or use the > immediate child selector
[06:17:17] <Patabugen> find('part > name') will return all the <name<s which are an immediate child of <part>s
[06:17:20] <shoky> none of those are what he's looking for i think
[06:17:27] <shoky> because the root element is part
[06:17:41] <shoky> find won't know about part
[06:17:53] <IfSixWasNine> for example i  like to expand the albums of akrabats tutorial with a second table called "label" and just add a labelId to the album-table itself, so whats the best practice to join them together? $this->select(); cant be use to join a table inside a model right?
[06:17:56] <IfSixWasNine> fc again sry
[06:17:57] <shoky> and get(0) is only specific to that example
[06:18:03] <shoky> hmm
[06:18:09] <nanovirus> anyone know where I can get my hands on Fancy Thumbnail Hover Effect with Jquery and CSS by Soh Tanaka.  His main site appears to be dead.  Is there a repo of plugins that contains this somewhere?
[06:18:28] <Patabugen> danieldeusing use children() instead of find() will do that too

[06:21:09] <M1asma> Hello all, how's it going this morning?
[06:21:26] <pachet> hello!
[06:21:28] <Patabugen> Excellent here M1asma, and for you?
[06:21:35] <nanovirus> pachet, cheers... urgh, it's a little jerky!  Already have something similar that works much smoother!
[06:21:50] <nanovirus> pachet, appreciate the help though dude!
[06:21:59] <M1asma> I'm not doing too bad, just recently got into the jQuerey mobile side of things, and was having some trouble, hoping a kind soul here could help me out :P
[06:22:07] <shoky> danieldeusing: this.children('name') isn't what you want?
[06:23:18] <danieldeusing> shoky:
[06:23:25] <danieldeusing> sure it was, i forgot the .text() ...
[06:23:30] <danieldeusing> thanks guys
[06:23:32] <Patabugen> hehe
[06:23:32] <shoky> o, kool
[06:24:16] <M1asma> Is anyone familiar with the Zazar jQuery zRSSFeed plugin?
[06:24:31] <NodeX> anyone know a cheeky way of finding the first button or submit input that submits a form
[06:24:47] <NodeX> I need to change either the val() of it or the html() if it's a button
[06:25:17] <shoky> the cheeky-challenge!
[06:25:47] <shoky> what do you mean, "that submits a form" ?
[06:25:55] <shoky> that is quite cheeky
[06:26:09] <shoky> not to mention tonguey
[06:26:18] <M1asma> I need to take this: http://pastebin.com/SNWKp5tu
[06:26:20] <NodeX> well either <button>foo</button> or <input type="submit" value="foo" /> lol
[06:26:30] <shoky> oh
[06:26:39] <M1asma> and hide it until a button is clicked, and then use the .show command to bring it to the field
[06:26:47] <M1asma> Only problem I'm having, is the whole thing >.<
[06:26:51] <NodeX> or a jquery way of changing value if it's input and html if it's button
[06:27:00] <NodeX> either will suffice my needs :D
[06:27:06] <shoky> ?:submit
[06:27:06] <bot-t> :submit: Selects all elements of type submit. http://api.jquery.com/submit-selector/
[06:27:13] <NodeX> nope
[06:27:23] <NodeX> that's only <input type="submit"...
[06:27:49] <shoky> $('button,input[type=submit]') ?
[06:27:54] <NodeX> it may well catch button but I need to val() for input and html() for button
[06:28:00] <shoky> oh
[06:28:06] <mikkelb> http://www.norgeistreik.tk/
[06:28:08] <NodeX> [14:26:48] <NodeX> or a jquery way of changing value if it's input and html if it's button
[06:28:23] <NodeX> was probs more an appropriate way of asking
[06:28:35] <shoky> ya sry i'm reading stuff too quickly today
[06:28:42] <shoky> only half of it is registering ;P
[06:28:53] <NodeX> I has that problem every day
[06:29:01] <shoky> ;Z
[06:29:18] <NodeX> looks like i'll have to write a quick method

[06:30:52] <NodeX> I left my crystal ball in my other laptop
[06:31:08] <M1asma> That's a plugin that I'm using link in a sec
[06:31:18] <M1asma> http://zazar.net/developers/jquery/zrssfeed/
[06:32:06] <NodeX> $("#test").hide().rssfeed(......)
[06:32:12] <NodeX> what's wrong with that
[06:32:22] <M1asma> Evidently nothing :P
[06:32:35] <M1asma> I'm very new to the jQuery world so forgive my ignorance.
[06:33:31] <tronne> is $('#element').on('change',function(){alert()}) supposed to alert when any element at all within #element has any changes made to it
[06:33:40] <M1asma> <script type="text/javascript">
[06:33:40] <M1asma> $("button").click(function () {
[06:33:40] <M1asma>   $('#test').show.rssfeed('http://www.dvgrr.org/Feeds/available-males', {
[06:33:40] <M1asma>     snippet: false
[06:33:40] <M1asma>   });
[06:33:40] <M1asma> });
[06:33:40] <M1asma> </script>
[06:37:11] <shoky> NodeX: btw why not ?$(':submit').html(v).val(v);?
[06:37:18] <shoky> oops
[06:37:41] <NodeX> good point
[06:37:48] <NodeX> tnx ;)
[06:37:52] <shoky> ;)
[06:37:59] <NodeX> the easiest answers are always the best
[06:38:23] * shoky cheeky
[06:38:48] <vdraghici> hello
[06:38:50] <NodeX> simplicity is golden
[06:38:59] <NodeX> keeps things zoom zoom speedy
[06:39:20] <tronne> the simpler solution can be more processor-heavy
[06:39:24] <tronne> often
[06:39:38] <NodeX> one thing that bugs the hell out of me in programming is people who write complex code to make themselves look smart when less complex code suffices
[06:39:44] <shoky> as long as you're aware of that it's kewl
[06:39:53] <vdraghici> quick question, I want to use jquery templates ( $('#id').tpl... ) but can't figure out how to make an IF variable > 5
[06:40:11] <tronne> like adding all prime numbers from 1 to 65535 in assembly or java
[06:40:47] <vdraghici> Anyone here have any ideas? I tried {{if(obj.foo>5)}} and everything, but nothing
[06:42:14] <xec> vdraghici: maybe you just need a space? as in {{if (obj.foo>5)}}
[06:42:50] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/template-tag-if/
[06:43:52] <vdraghici> xec: i'm there, but can't see how I can check for anything beside if the variable exists... ex: {{if Languages}} but I want {{if Language == "CA"}}
[06:44:14] <vdraghici> or actually: {{if myFunction(Language) == 5}}
[06:44:36] <vdraghici> and I also tried space, no space, sideways and everything lol
[06:45:13] <mikkelb> hey anybody know of any supersimple sites like craigslist.org, drudgereport.com, pinboard.in, sandboxautomatic.com etc.?
[06:45:17] <xec> did you try it with the parens?
[06:46:39] <vdraghici> yes, but the strange thing is: == 5 works, < 5 does not (template stops working and I get "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ; " in my console for the jquery template script file
[06:47:24] <riskyshenanigan> if i dont have a main header for h1, should i go straight to h2 tags?
[06:47:32] <shoky> i see JR giving this example: {{if user.height > 5}} This user is tall!{{/if}}
[06:47:48] <shoky> (here http://forum.jquery.com/topic/templating-syntax )
[06:48:10] <xec> maybe the < is starting a tag rather than being interpreted as less than
[06:48:22] <vdraghici> shoky: checking, did not see that post yet, thanks (did not try yet)
[06:49:45] <gkunno> I have a element that animates via CSS as a flipbox, however when the element is flipped back (after a interval) the transitions is not working. Any ideas? http://pastebin.com/ZZD3KqeF
[06:50:00] * JAAulde is deep in fed govt resume paperwork and IE bugs (one of those days when being a web dev is soooo rewarding :P )
[06:52:13] <shoky> gkunno: why toggle(0) twice?
[06:52:28] <shoky> gkunno: o sry nm
[06:54:13] <shoky> gkunno: prolly not the issue, but, you're calling .removeClass on the same element at the same time, multiple times
[06:54:26] <gkunno> hmm..
[06:55:05] <shoky> gkunno: also a jsfiddle would be much better
[06:55:42] <gkunno> first i add a class (the class has the animation in css) on click, with 2 children, back and front. And the element removes the class after the delay
[06:55:58] <gkunno> yeah i know.. maybe i should put it there
[06:56:00] <shoky> not 'the element' , but both children
[06:56:17] <shoky> both remove from their mutual parent
[06:57:38] <xec> does this .flip class initiate a css animation?
[06:57:45] <gkunno> fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ZnYx7/
[06:58:04] <tdskate> with this new template context change I get this error : You cannot provide a template block if you also specified a templateName
[06:58:09] <tdskate> how can it be fixed ?
[06:58:41] <shoky> so, doesn't that work?
[06:59:44] <phrearch> hey
[07:00:14] <phrearch> whats the best way to bind a live event handler to a form thats being erased, and injected in the dom again?
[07:00:22] <phrearch> i got something like $('#auth-box form').on('submit', function(e){
[07:00:34] <phrearch> where auth-box is an element thats being injected in
[07:00:43] <globe_tmp> hi guys
[07:00:52] <phrearch> or do i need to use delegate for that
[07:01:00] <globe_tmp> anybody using the plugin jqTransform
[07:01:01] <globe_tmp> ?
[07:01:58] <sekretskwerl> hey yous guys, if you have a form with id #form, and you do data = $("#form").serialize() and then feed it into an ajax request dataType: 'json', data: data…that works, yes?
[07:02:08] <shoky> phrearch: yea you either need to delegate or to re-bind when its re-injected
[07:02:11] <sekretskwerl> I have examples of it working, but the jQuery documentation would either seem to disagree or leave that bit out.
[07:02:47] <Haprog> sekretskwerl: is it id="#form" or just id="form" ?
[07:02:50] <phrearch> shoky, think i found it. $('#auth-box').on('submit', function(e){
[07:02:59] <sekretskwerl> Haprog: just id="form"..
[07:03:04] <shoky> phrearch: mm does that work
[07:03:10] <phrearch> i suppose the event is triggered when the event is bubbling up upon that parent element
[07:03:46] <shoky> phrearch actually i've never delegated a submit event so i've no idea
[07:04:09] <Haprog> sekretskwerl: that should work. I remember using that somewhere
[07:04:34] <sekretskwerl> yeah. the documentation says it returns a query string. but I know I've fed it into a json ajax call before and it works fine.
[07:04:41] <sekretskwerl> so maybe the ajax function parses it? or I dunno
[07:05:05] <shoky> dataType is for what the server responds
[07:05:11] <shoky> not for the data you're sending with the request
[07:05:14] <Haprog> sekretskwerl: well the ajax functios does take a query string. if you give it something else it parses it into a query string first.
[07:05:28] <sekretskwerl> ah
[07:05:32] <Haprog> the data property I mean
[07:05:37] <sekretskwerl> so the dataType is just for what you want it to return to you
[07:05:43] <Haprog> yes
[07:06:05] <Haprog> or actually it defines what you expect from the server as a response
[07:06:30] <Haprog> if the server returns json then you use dataType: 'json'
[07:07:08] <sekretskwerl> right, gotcha.
[07:07:23] <sekretskwerl> i was pretty sure I was correct in thinking that, but now I know why to a deeper level, so
[07:07:26] <sekretskwerl> it's good that I asked!
[07:07:57] <BMCouto> Hi, can anyone check this http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11868
[07:08:30] <darthdeus> hey guys, is there a simple way to do something like $("input").not(":empty")?
[07:08:50] <sekretskwerl> yep, there's a function for that actually, but i don't remember it off the top of my head
[07:10:18] <Zhy> can't you either check the val() or the length ?
[07:11:41] <Zhy> if ($('yourinput').val() =='')
[07:13:17] <shoky> $('input[val!=""]')  :P
[07:13:55] <Zhy> :D
[07:14:14] <shoky> hm
[07:14:19] <Zhy> ?
[07:14:24] <Zhy> switch " with ' ?
[07:14:40] <shoky> er first of all value and not val heh
[07:14:44] <vdraghici> question: when I do: $('#id').tmpl(obj); and in the #id I have {{if foo<11}} is it normal that the jquery template turns the < into &lt; ? Am I dooing something wrong here?
[07:15:08] <Zhy> ah that's irrelevant xD *cough*
[07:15:22] <shoky> but also
[07:15:43] <shoky> ah nm.
[07:20:28] <pachet> $.fn.withValue = function(val){return ( typeof val == 'undefined') ? $(this).filter(function(){return $(this).val()!='';}) : $(this).filter(function(){return $(this).val()==val;});}
[07:20:47] <pachet> $('input').withValue() or $('input').withValue('foo') --> yay
[07:22:34] <pachet> i guess it'd be less ugly if that ternary was inside the .filter(), oh well
[07:24:32] <Goopyo> anyone know of any good jquery plugins for percentage input?
[07:24:46] <Goopyo> Something like the jquery slider
[07:24:49] <vdraghici> question: i have allot of data frm the server in JSON format, and I need to display it as: obj.int_val1 + obj.int_val2, is there a smarter way then dooing parseFloat(obj.int_val1) + parseFloat(obj.int_val2), so it adds them as numbers and not strings all the time ? (I have parseFloat like 1000 times in there)
[07:26:37] <Lexflex3000> hello jquery geeks
[07:26:44] <mikkelb> hey - whats the benefit of having "request an invite" instead of "signup" like pinterest or what not?
[07:27:53] <pachet> artificial feeling of exclusivity
[07:29:03] <Goopyo> also email validation at the front
[07:29:34] <mikkelb> pachet: but if you want this app to be as public as possible, wont such exclusivity make you seem more withdrawn?
[07:30:11] <BMCouto> Hi, can anyone check this http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11868
[07:30:49] <mikkelb> wont it like.. possibly compromise new signups as the user will go like.. "huh? that doesn't say signup or join.." then he or she must spend a couple of milliseconds figuring out what this button actually is and by then it's all gone?
[07:31:42] <pachet> mikkelb: maybe, but its definitely a tactic employed by other early-phase social media startups
[07:31:43] <shoky> BMCouto: they'll check it soon enough
[07:32:03] <shoky> BMCouto: FWIW, seems legit to me
[07:32:04] <mikkelb> pachet: true that
[07:32:11] <mikkelb> none of which has grown to become very big, am i right?
[07:32:17] <pachet> mikkelb: facebook?
[07:32:17] <BMCouto> shoky:  FWIW?
[07:32:25] <mikkelb> hehe ok i take it back
[07:32:33] <shoky> BMCouto: except for not choosing jquery in the fiddle making it a non working fiddle
[07:32:36] <mikkelb> might argue its a bit different in their case though
[07:32:44] <shoky> BMCouto: fwiw=for what it's worth
[07:32:49] <mikkelb> things were different back then
[07:33:02] <BMCouto> shoky:  ahh ok, ups i forgot, but I believe that its enough for testing purposes
[07:33:22] <Lexflex3000> i have to create a expandable table, very much like the example 1 A here: http://ludo.cubicphuse.nl/jquery-plugins/treeTable/doc/#example-2  ... however, this plugin doesn't suit my styling needs (need to create alternating backgrounds for <tr>'s .. any alternatives for this?
[07:34:20] <Posterdati> hi
[07:34:48] <Posterdati> please I need a good tutorial for jquery, is there any linux tools to design website with jquery? Thanks
[07:35:05] <pachet> vim
[07:35:07] <pachet> :[
[07:35:08] <xmaddness> linux tools?
[07:35:15] <xmaddness> nano, vim, joe
[07:35:19] <Posterdati> lol
[07:35:22] <Lexflex3000> hehehehe
[07:35:26] <shanky_ty> gimp for image
[07:35:28] <xmaddness> gl hf
[07:35:36] <Lexflex3000> i think he meant visual studio for linux and jquery :)
[07:35:42] <shanky_ty> lol
[07:35:53] <shanky_ty> visual studio
[07:36:02] <shanky_ty> lynx
[07:36:03] <xmaddness> that reminds me I wanted to try out cloud 9 today
[07:36:03] <kelye> hello
[07:36:22] <xmaddness> has anyone used that?
[07:36:25] <kelye> how can i run a function after a trigger finished execution ?
[07:36:35] <Posterdati> visual studio isn't a linux tool is a mess :)
[07:36:42] <xmaddness> bind to the trigger, then execute the function
[07:38:00] <Deele> hey
[07:38:15] <X-Raimo> hello, i'm using jquery-localize rfrom here: https://github.com/coderifous/jquery-localize. Loading multiple files as it written in README ain't work well. My Code: $("[rel*=loc]").localize(locDir+"/nav").localize(locDir+"/main"); In nav-ru.json - translation for nav element, and in main - the rest. When this executes main override navigation element with empty text.
[07:38:26] <Deele> how to push in array object, where key is evaluated js
[07:38:52] <Deele> pagRules.push({
[07:38:52] <Deele> $(this).find('td').first().html(), id = id.substr(0,id.length - 1) : {
[07:39:05] <Deele> this fails as syntax problem
[07:39:19] <Deele> sorry, wrong line
[07:39:41] <Rushing> Deele: javascript arrays only have numeric keys
[07:39:51] <Deele> pagRules.push({ id : {
[07:39:59] <Rushing> looks like you're pushing a key/value object into the array
[07:40:03] <Deele> where id IS number
[07:40:15] <Deele> result shows 'id' as string
[07:40:28] <Rushing> ah, then you'd want pageRules[id] = value
[07:40:40] <Deele> oh, damnit
[07:41:16] <kelye> xmaddness:  it's a bit more complicated .. i'm opening a modal window and populate it with a form (ajax)
[07:42:02] <kelye> then, after the form submission (with ajax) i want the response to be available în the modal window
[07:42:15] <tdskate> is there a quick way to transform an array from this [ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' ] to [ 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'A', 'B' ]
[07:42:22] <tdskate> the values shifted 2 positions
[07:42:50] <Rushing> kelye: in your success/complete callback, get the content of your modal window and replace it with the response
[07:43:16] <Rushing> var $content = $(".modal .content-or-something"); $content.replaceWith(xhr.responseText);
[07:43:31] <kelye> i don
[07:43:42] <kelye> the response is a json
[07:43:50] <xec> tdskate: you can probably use .slice() and .concat() for something like that
[07:43:58] <kelye> i need to process that json and create a new element in the main page
[07:44:26] <Ukto> if I have a div that will have data polling every seconds to update 3~4 info displays (values) would it be better to jsut constantly refetch/write the whole div, or use some sort of template setup to just update the specific vars?
[07:44:29] <Rushing> then do that, then replace the modal content with the new element
[07:44:52] <kelye> picture this.. i have a list of ..categories, i have a 'add category' button... i open a modal with a form to create a new category
[07:45:28] <kelye> after the successful submission i get the returned json (id of new category, name, etc) and i want to pass it in the main window
[07:45:31] <kelye> to add it in the list
[07:45:49] <xmaddness> kelye: Whatever it is you need to do, just add that function to the success, and pass it the json
[07:46:05] <kelye> so the steps are .. open modal , ajax-get form, ajax-submit form, get response, close modal, add new element
[07:46:17] <xmaddness> success --> function(json) --> process json --> dump to modal
[07:46:55] <kelye> this is done in a graceful degradation way
[07:47:17] <kelye> the 'add category form' has to work in a non-modal way also
[07:47:38] <kelye> so i included the 'ajax form' code there, in the form page
[07:47:44] <kelye> not in the main page
[07:47:52] <xec> ?eval var arr = [ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' ]; console.log(arr.slice(4).concat(arr.slice(0,4))); @ tdskate
[07:47:52] <caniuse> xec: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL'
[07:47:58] <xec> hehe or maybe not
[07:48:01] <kelye> so the success callback is unaware of the bigger picture
[07:48:11] <shoky> ?eval var a = ['a','b','c','d','e','f']; a.unshift.apply( a, a.splice(2, a.length ) ); a
[07:48:11] <caniuse> shoky: [ 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'a', 'b' ]
[07:48:13] <tdskate> xec: what I needed was to loop X amounts of times over array.push(array.shift());
[07:48:33] <xec> nice one shoky
[07:49:01] <shoky> modified an SO comment ;p
[07:49:03] <tdskate> ABCD are just placeholder values, they contain dates in my app :p
[07:49:08] <xmaddness> kelye: then on the submit, fire a trogger and pass the args. Setup a bind on that trigger to do whatever. The bind can go in anywhere
[07:49:20] <xmaddness> erm s/submit/success
[07:49:21] <tdskate> *the array contains dates in my app
[07:49:31] <xmaddness> s/trogger/trigger
[07:49:33] <xmaddness> :x
[07:50:41] <xec> tdskate: the values doesn't matter. did you see what shoky posted?
[07:50:42] <shoky> tdskate: why not have just an int variable to store the index to the "first" element
[07:51:20] <RonWhoCares> hello
[07:52:35] <RonWhoCares> my JQuery ajax won't work when the portion that triggers the jquery ajax is displayed on the web page as a result of an option the user choose from a <select> list.  Is there a work around?
[07:52:36] <kelye> yes, i was looking at that
[07:52:42] <kelye> ty xmaddness
[07:52:54] <xec> ?eval var arr = [ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' ]; arr.slice(4).concat(arr.slice(0,4));
[07:52:54] <caniuse> xec: [ 'E', 'F', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' ]
[07:53:08] <xec> hmm. what did i do wrong in my first try?
[07:53:25] <RonWhoCares> I did confirm it is working correctly by bringing it up when the page first loads as a "test".  I can't leave it this way.
[07:53:55] <shoky> haha
[07:53:58] <shoky> xec:   @ tdskate
[07:54:04] <xec> doh!
[07:54:12] * xec facepalms
[07:54:19] <tdskate> awesome, seems to work :)
[07:54:46] <xec> RonWhoCares: need more details about how this "triggering" is in order to make any guesses
[07:55:17] <xec> RonWhoCares: the ajax happens on some sort of event?
[07:55:41] <shoky> who cares?
[07:55:50] <xec> i care!
[07:55:55] <nFFF> shoky, can you explain a.unshift.apply
[07:55:57] <RonWhoCares> xec: The trigger is based on the class .delete       echo "<input type=\"image\" name=\"" . $member_service_account_maintenance_reference . "." . $key . "." . $list . "\" id=\"" . $member_service_account_maintenance_reference . "." . $key . "." . $list . "\" value=\"Delete\" class=\"delete\" src=\"http://administration.actsministrieschristianevangelism.org/images/X.png\" />\r\n";
[07:55:57] <shoky> who els?!
[07:56:02] <nFFF> I thought unshift was a method that took arguments
[07:56:11] <nFFF> whats happening in your line fo codez?
[07:56:12] <xec> shoky: santa cares!
[07:56:39] <xec> shoky: but i don't think Ron cares
[07:56:50] <xec> shoky: never trust irc nicks :P
[07:57:03] <shoky> nFFF:  it is a function.  .apply calls a function, but you can supply the arguments as an array instead of one by one  (and you also have to supply a context as first argument to apply)
[07:57:12] <RonWhoCares> xec: This code is displayed AFTER the user chooses from a <select>
[07:57:23] <xec> RonWhoCares: looks like PHP to me
[07:57:49] <shoky> nFFF: a.splice(...) returns an array, so i couldn't do:  a.unshift( a.splice(...) )
[07:58:05] <shoky> nFFF: because unshift expects seperate arguments for each element to add to the array
[07:58:07] <xec> RonWhoCares: could you make a pastebin with the relevant javascript and markup (that your browser sees)?
[07:58:08] <RonWhoCares> xec: It is PHP that displays the JQuery ajax
[07:58:18] <RonWhoCares> xec: ok
[07:58:33] <xec> wait
[07:58:35] <shoky> nFFF: make sensey?
[07:59:13] <xec> RonWhoCares: how do you bind to (listen to) the change event? are you using something like .bind() or .on()?
[08:00:52] <nFFF> shoky, I fully understand apply, just can't figure out what unshift does in your code
[08:01:00] <nFFF> As you don't actually pass anyhting to unshift
[08:01:12] <nFFF> oh wait
[08:01:13] <nFFF> nevermind
[08:01:16] <shoky> nFFF: .apply passes stuff to it
[08:01:18] <shoky> ;p
[08:01:19] <nFFF> Yes
[08:01:27] <nFFF> Just clocked onto that feel sily now :D
[08:01:34] * shoky sits on nFFF
[08:01:37] <shoky> how bout now??
[08:01:53] <nFFF> Real silly :>
[08:01:57] <shoky> ;D;dZ:dZD:ZD:D
[08:02:02] <nFFF> AS soon as I typed it out
[08:02:17] <nFFF> I realised my mistake
[08:03:02] <shoky> then you let me sit on you
[08:03:12] <shoky> and realised another mistake
[08:05:03] <RonWhoCares> xec:  As you requested, here is your pastebin:
[08:05:05] <RonWhoCares> http://pastebin.com/Gfx5mfG6
[08:07:42] <shoky> and here it is a bit more readable: http://pastebin.com/znREzUJj
[08:07:59] <shoky> er not really :\
[08:08:56] <kelye> is there a way to check if a particular event was registred ?
[08:09:49] <shoky> kelye:  you can check it with $(element).data('events') but that is undocumented and is subject to change
[08:11:49] <Posterdati> hi
[08:12:32] <Posterdati> please I installed debian jquery, but I can't use it in html docs -> I added <script type="text/javascript" src="/usr/share/javascript/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
[08:12:47] <shoky> RonWhoCares: you want $('#someContainerElement').on('click', '.delete', function() { .... } )
[08:13:10] <shoky> RonWhoCares: where the element is some container thats already in the DOM when you call .on(...)
[08:13:29] <globe_tmp> guys i have 2 string that contain the same char and have the same size but their comparison return false    ville.toLowerCase() == selectedCity.toString().toLowerCase()
[08:13:39] <shoky> RonWhoCares: if you dont have any container element you can just use $('body') or $(document)
[08:14:29] <shoky> RonWhoCares: another option is to call $('.select').click(...)  only AFTER those elements are already added to the DOM
[08:14:56] <RonWhoCares> The container designed for this is:       <div id="account_maintenance_existing_subscription_suspensions">  </div>
[08:15:52] <shoky> globe_tmp: what are the strings
[08:16:04] <shoky> RonWhoCares: then use that
[08:16:55] <globe_tmp> shoky: when i do console.log of both of them it give's me ville :casablanca  SELECTED:casablanca
[08:17:14] <globe_tmp> shoky: the 2 string are 'casablanca'
[08:17:37] <shoky> got a live demo?
[08:17:55] <shoky> what is selectedCity  btw ?
[08:18:39] <shoky> obviously not a string ..
[08:18:47] <RonWhoCares> So I should replace    $('.delete').click(function() {    with     $('#account_maintenance_existing_subscription_suspensions').on('click', '.delete', function() {
[08:19:31] <shoky> RonWhoCares: yea. if that div is in the dom to begin with
[08:20:41] <shoky> RonWhoCares: but what you should really do is read http://api.jquery.com/on/  especially the part about event delegation
[08:20:57] <globe_tmp> shoky: yeah one of them is  a var which contain a html result that i trim
[08:21:16] <shoky> globe_tmp: so it IS a string?
[08:21:37] <shoky> globe_tmp: jsfiddle the issue plz
[08:21:49] <globe_tmp> ok 1 min
[08:25:31] <RonWhoCares> Thank you xec  I appreciate your help
[08:26:46] <Posterdati> please is there a tutorial to configure jquery on debian?
[08:29:43] <xec> Posterdati: jquery is a javascript library - not something you'd install or configure
[08:30:25] <Posterdati> xec: ok, so what about <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.js"></script>
[08:30:52] <xec> Posterdati: assuming the path is correct, that should work
[08:30:58] <Posterdati> xec: it seems that it won't find anything, I followed: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[08:31:05] <xec> but it really doesn't have much to do with debian
[08:31:08] <Posterdati> it didn't work at all
[08:31:21] <xec> Posterdati: what exactly are you trying to do?
[08:31:48] <Posterdati> the tutorial in http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[08:32:14] <Posterdati> jquery is in /usr/share/javascript/jquery/...
[08:32:19] <snover> sigh.
[08:32:23] <xec> Posterdati: ok. do you have a basic knowledge of javascript?
[08:32:35] <Posterdati> xec: a little
[08:32:51] <xec> Posterdati: do you know how to include an external javascript file on your page?
[08:33:12] <Posterdati> <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
[08:33:50] <xec> you don't need the type attribute, but yes. that should work .... assuming the path is correct. is the path correct?
[08:34:29] <Posterdati> xec: I don't know is it relative to document root or absolute?
[08:35:24] <xec> document root?
[08:35:33] <xec> as in the apache config?
[08:35:37] <Posterdati> yes
[08:35:53] <xec> then no
[08:36:04] <xec> it will be relative to the document, unless you start with a /
[08:36:10] <dipser> did you write the js in <script></script> and did you write jquery in <script>$(function() {...});</script>
[08:36:29] <Posterdati> so yes
[08:36:55] <firedfox> xec: this is easier: <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[08:37:00] <xec> Posterdati: what you have is src="jquery.js"  --- which means relative to the document. not the root
[08:37:13] <Posterdati> ok
[08:37:20] <xec> firedfox: yes, but you agree that this is basic stuff he really should know, right? ;)
[08:37:22] <Posterdati> so ../
[08:37:37] <dipser> show your page
[08:38:08] <firedfox> you are right.
[08:39:09] <Posterdati> http://pastebin.com/C3FRyUty
[08:39:17] <xec> Posterdati: src="/jquery.js" will be linking to a file in your (apache config) document root folder
[08:39:43] <xec> Posterdati: while src="jquery.js" will be linking to a file in the same folder as your html file
[08:39:45] <Posterdati> xec: :( not working
[08:40:03] <dipser> jquery( ) ?
[08:40:48] <xec> Posterdati: like dipser pointed out... what on earth is this jquery( ... ) business
[08:41:11] <Posterdati> don't know :)
[08:41:24] <xec> well it's your code isn't it? didn't you write it?
[08:41:41] <Posterdati> I copied from the tutorial
[08:41:43] <vdraghici> hey, what's a good tooltip plugin for jquery? I'm using qtip2 but when I have to add over 200 qtips it slows down the brwser way to much (i need to show html as tooltip)
[08:42:02] <Posterdati> xec: working!
[08:42:05] <xec> vdraghici: why don't you just use .show() and .hide() ?
[08:42:31] <Posterdati> xec: I put a link of jquery and css in the same document dir
[08:42:44] <Posterdati> xec: thanks
[08:42:52] <Posterdati> xec: and removed the jquery ()
[08:42:59] <xec> vdraghici: tooltips are one of the easiest things you can make yourself, really
[08:43:15] <dipser> Posterdati: use $(function() {  ...  });
[08:43:22] <vdraghici> xec: was not 100% sure if i want to deal with the hide part, I need to show quite a bit of data, and if the mouse is to low, show it over, if not show it under and the position and so on...
[08:44:05] <xec> ah right, yeah if it's a big popup positioning can be tricky
[08:44:34] <xec> dipser: he's already using $(document).ready() -- no need to confuse him just yet ;)
[08:44:41] <vdraghici> so was wandering if there is something already made, but qtip2 renders the darn things 1000 times and stores the resulting html....
[08:45:39] <Posterdati> xec: is it possible to load svg ?
[08:46:04] <xec> Posterdati: in what sense
[08:46:11] <vdraghici> xec: another stupid question, you used jquery UI, in different brwsers, when I make a buttonset out of an input and a button, the heights are different, any ideas why? (am I dooing something stupid?)
[08:46:30] <Posterdati> I've got a map in svg format and I want to load it in the page to show it
[08:46:32] <xec> Posterdati: most browsers nowadays natively support svg if that's what you mean
[08:46:53] <DukeDrake> jo
[08:46:55] <Posterdati> xec: I've to add interaction with that svg
[08:46:56] <xec> Posterdati: you don't need jquery for that. tried googling?
[08:46:56] <DukeDrake> hi
[08:47:08] <xec> oh i see, what sort of interaction
[08:47:29] <Posterdati> xec: I need to point and click on it to show popup for particular point a la googlemaps
[08:48:12] <xec> Posterdati: that's probably doable with inline svg, but i can't really say as i haven't tried
[08:48:28] <DukeDrake> are there ajax events for readstates 2 and 3 yet?
[08:48:31] <Posterdati> xec: svg + html are very limited
[08:48:36] <DukeDrake> *readystates
[08:49:04] <Posterdati> xec: problems are popup, html uses windows, I don't like it I prefer a dialog like jquery do
[08:49:40] <xec> jquery dialog?
[08:49:45] <xec> are you talking about jquery ui?
[08:49:50] <Posterdati> yes
[08:50:08] <xec> what do you mean by "html uses windows"?
[08:50:21] <Posterdati> popup are browser windows
[08:50:33] <xec> ah i see
[08:50:51] <xec> well okay, no reason you can't have content in a dialog instead
[08:52:09] <Posterdati> xec: could a jquery-ui could have html into too?
[08:52:27] <shady---> I would like to set the maxDate to the precise current date\time: $( "#datepicker" ).datetimepicker({ dateFormat: "yy-mm-dd", minDate: new Date(2012, 4 - 1, 20, 0, 0, 0), maxDate: new Date(2013, 4 - 1, 20, 23, 59, 59), 	
[08:52:36] <shady---> I read a forum post which said to use "0" but it doesn't work, any suggestions?
[08:53:01] <xec> i don't know what "a jquery-ui" is in this context. a dialog?
[08:53:07] <shady---> yes sir
[08:53:27] <shady---> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-maxDate
[08:53:32] <xec> shady---: was that "yes sir" for me?
[08:53:39] <shady---> yes
[08:53:40] <xec> shady---: i was replying to Posterdati
[08:53:42] <shady---> oh
[08:53:44] <shady---> =]
[08:53:46] <Posterdati> xec: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/loading-existing-html-pages-into-a-jquery-dialog-window
[08:56:00] <Techdeck> hey guys, let's say I have an array: var arr = [ "a", "b", "c", "d"  ], I want to shift it by 2 indexes to be: [ "c", "d", "a", "b" ] (this is just an example array, the real array will be bigger). Is there a jquerish way of doing this? or maybe even native javascript?
[08:56:06] <xec> Posterdati: honestly, it appears you're trying to run a marathon before learning how to crawl. but to answer your question: i don't think there's any constraints on what you can put in a jquery ui dialog
[08:56:22] <Posterdati> xec: :)
[08:56:55] <Techdeck> actually I could just write a function to do it pretty easily.. nvm
[08:57:18] <xec> ?learn
[08:57:30] * xec misses bot-t
[08:57:47] <Whirl3d> ? learn
[08:57:52] <Whirl3d> wah
[08:57:53] <johnkpaul> I don't believe caniuse can learn yet
[08:58:17] <Whirl3d> ? definitely
[08:58:33] <Whirl3d> I swear shoky defined definitely for bot-t last night.
[08:59:06] <xec> i thought ?learn was the message about learning html before css before js before jquery
[08:59:21] <shady---> $( "#datepicker" ).datetimepicker({ dateFormat: "yy-mm-dd", minDate: new Date(2012, 4 - 1, 20, 0, 0, 0), maxDate: new Date(Now), <=== How would I make the date "Now"?
[08:59:46] <johnkpaul> oh, yes, xec, you're right, it was
[08:59:50] <shady---> ?learn
[08:59:55] <johnkpaul> what I mean was that caniuse does not have the ability to learn new things
[08:59:58] <johnkpaul> like ?learn
[09:00:02] <johnkpaul> :) it's confusing
[09:00:09] <xec> haha, right. it is
[09:00:11] <arphen> hi
[09:00:14] <xec> xD
[09:01:16] <arphen> i have a problem. i'm trying to link a function to a .click event, but it doesnt work.
[09:01:18] <arphen> line seventeen
[09:01:19] <arphen> http://pastebin.com/cdxD3Pfa
[09:01:45] <arphen> (i tried to check if it was just the click event malfunctioning so i tested it with mouseover)
[09:02:28] <coder7of9> i have a named ul element and i would like to assign an onmouseover handler to each li in this ul element. in plain js i can do this in a second - how to do it in jquery please
[09:03:38] <DukeDrake> coder7of9: $('#yourul li').hover( function() { } );
[09:04:03] <shady---> $( "#datepicker" ).datetimepicker({ dateFormat: "yy-mm-dd", minDate: new Date(2012, 4 - 1, 20, 0, 0, 0), maxDate: new Date(Now), <=== How would I make the date "Now"?
[09:04:13] <coder7of9> thanks. just figured it out myself
[09:04:23] <coder7of9> also
[09:06:07] <arphen> is there anything special i have to note when i assign a .click(function(){});
[09:06:07] <arphen> ?
[09:10:38] <cime> hi! I'm inserting a row into table like this: $('table.mytable tbody tr:first').before('...') , but this works just if there is atleast one row in the table... how would I insert this row even if the table has no rows?
[09:10:46] <SleepyPikachu> Could someone give me a hand with this error? www.edesix.com/construction
[09:11:41] <SleepyPikachu> johnkpaul: you arround?
[09:11:51] <SleepyPikachu> around*
[09:13:32] <SleepyPikachu> Anyone awake? :P
[09:13:35] <NoiseEee> cime: perhaps your row should be the first thing after <tbody>, and not the first thing before the first <tr>
[09:15:07] <shoky> Whirl3d heh i did but bot-t is MIA as usual
[09:16:08] <arphen> can anyone help me and tell me why .click(function(){alert("ROFL")}; refuses to work for me in line 17? http://pastebin.com/GUikGNja
[09:16:37] <Whirl3d> whose bot is he?
[09:18:02] <shoky> no idea
[09:18:47] <zoite> arphen, Are you sure numItems is being populated?
[09:19:30] <shoky> arphen: jsfiddle plz
[09:20:30] <arphen> jsfidddle?
[09:21:02] <arphen> zoite, the .html() is working properly ( same line)
[09:21:10] <arphen> just the onlick binder is not initiated
[09:21:19] <arphen> i also tried .hover() and it doesnt either
[09:21:25] <shoky> arphen: www.jqfiddle.net
[09:21:29] <shoky> so we can see a demo
[09:21:35] <shoky> and fiddle with it
[09:21:40] <zoite> jqfiddle must be the updated version :P
[09:22:36] <shoky> SleepyPikachu: you dont have superfish defined anywhere..
[09:23:10] <JAAulde> zoite: q < s so it must be a beta
[09:23:12] <shoky> zoite it's the same ol jsfiddle ;P
[09:23:23] * JAAulde waves at SleepyPikachu
[09:24:00] <SleepyPikachu> sorry I was away
[09:24:07] <arphen> shoky http://jsfiddle.net/m5Ze2/
[09:24:08] <SleepyPikachu> took headphones off
[09:24:11] <SleepyPikachu> didn't hear the blip
[09:24:22] <arphen> but theres really too much code to make a working snippet out of it
[09:24:31] <JAAulde> s'all good
[09:24:54] <SleepyPikachu> shoky: The superfish comes from a plugin :/
[09:24:56] <arphen> i must be doing some stupid mistake
[09:24:59] <shoky> SleepyPikachu: where?
[09:25:27] <SleepyPikachu> I just turned off the plugin to see if it would resolve my issue
[09:25:36] <SleepyPikachu> give me two ticks to sort this other thing out ^^
[09:25:41] * SleepyPikachu appreciates the help
[09:25:47] <shoky> arphen: add some html to go with that js, get the fiddle to demonstrate the problem
[09:26:27] <shoky> wat
[09:26:29] <shoky> oh
[09:26:36] <shoky> nm!
[09:28:03] <arphen> zoite, you got any idea?
[09:29:03] <shoky> arphen: i doubt anyone will have any idea without seeing the problem for themselves. your code SEEMS fine
[09:29:10] <SleepyPikachu> shoky: so with the plugin activated, as it is presently
[09:29:25] <zoite> yeah, I can't really tell without seeing what you're doing and how you're calling it
[09:29:30] <SleepyPikachu> the slider doesn't get a chance because of the error in the plugin code
[09:30:06] <shoky> SleepyPikachu: where is the plugin included?
[09:30:17] <arphen> its a really isolated funciton that is completely new, i thought i was doing a retarded mistake in my code.
[09:30:20] <arphen> thanks for looking over it
[09:30:28] <arphen> i could...
[09:30:35] <SleepyPikachu> Does plugin mean something special in jquery? I meant it in a wordpress context
[09:30:47] <zoite> I would assume there is something wrong with cItems[i].lessonname
[09:31:14] <shoky> SleepyPikachu: i donno wordpress.. but jquery plugins are usually some js file you include. (either seperately or in your own minified package whatever)
[09:31:23] <zoite> Have you verified it finds the right element?
[09:31:37] <arphen> zoite, shoky http://93.134.238.113/home/Mobile
[09:31:43] <SleepyPikachu> In the context of wordpress a plugin is just a modification, largely hidden from the installing user
[09:32:05] <arphen> use the login chris/chris and from console type :"display_course(usercourselist[0])"
[09:32:11] <arphen> that will show the problem
[09:32:14] <SleepyPikachu> arphen: you have a 404 there
[09:32:18] <arphen> goddamnit
[09:32:18] <shoky> arphen: one thing that looked a bit suspicious (but could be fine, i dono):  is that you do  $content.append(markup);
[09:32:27] <shoky> o
[09:33:59] <shoky> SleepyPikachu: there's no superfish plugin included..
[09:34:01] <arphen> no 404 for me though ? 0,o i just tried to access it from university and that works
[09:34:15] <arphen> http://93.134.238.113/home/Mobile/index.html
[09:34:27] <SleepyPikachu> shoky: The Wordpress plugin is Multi-Level menu, it utilises the superfish script
[09:35:39] <shoky> SleepyPikachu: i have no idea about wordpress plugins. that is serverside stuff. the fact remains: theres no plugin included that adds a superfish jq method..
[09:36:12] <SleepyPikachu> never mind I think I've got it ^^
[09:36:15] <SleepyPikachu> thanks though
[09:36:18] <shoky> ;p
[09:36:23] <zoite> arphen, What is the expected input for "kourse"
[09:36:48] <arphen> a complicated object
[09:36:56] <arphen> it all works, only the .click() link is never done
[09:37:05] <arphen> if i link it afterwards from console it works fine
[09:37:05] <arphen> :S
[09:37:12] <arphen> the object:
[09:37:22] <johnkpaul> SleepyPikachu: what's up
[09:38:56] <arphen> zoite this is an object of the type kourse http://pastebin.com/JcAQBJ1E
[09:39:10] <arphen> and it properly reads kourse.name for every element
[09:39:15] <zoite> ah
[09:39:15] <arphen> but the next line with .click is just ignored
[09:40:45] <mikkelb> whats it called when, say at http://losangeles.craigslist.org/act/, new posts would fade in automatically without having to reload?
[09:40:56] <zoite> sorry, I don't know the answer. perhaps someone more knowledgable than me will know
[09:41:04] <arphen> zoite, thanks i found the mistake
[09:41:11] <zoite> what was it?
[09:41:13] <arphen> actually shoky did it
[09:41:22] <xmaddness> mikkelb: ajax?
[09:41:23] <arphen> the problem lies afterwards
[09:41:25] <xmaddness> :x
[09:41:47] <arphen> http://pastebin.com/GUikGNja line 7 line 30 line 31 are faulty
[09:42:14] <mikkelb> xmaddness: thats it "ajax"?
[09:42:16] <arphen> because markup is a child of content and i call content.empty();content.append(markup)
[09:42:18] <arphen> that doesnt work
[09:42:22] <mikkelb> doesnt it have another name
[09:42:29] <mikkelb> ajax can be so many things right?
[09:42:29] <zoite> ah indeed, nice catch shoky
[09:42:57] <arphen> but i feel like that should have given a warning
[09:43:03] <xmaddness> mikkelb: not really, all that its doing it polling for changes via ajax, and when it finds up, updates the DOM
[09:43:10] <xmaddness> s/up/one
[09:44:07] <zoite> arphen, welcome to javascript :P
[09:44:20] <zoite> error handling? what's that
[09:45:55] <arphen> zoite i will rant about js AFTER i get my stuff done..
[09:46:09] <zoite> lol
[09:46:11] <arphen> now i have to figure out how to use .listview on a <ul> element
[09:47:00] <arphen> because now i get TypeError: Cannot read property 'jQuery16408798318738117814' of undefined when i do "$("<ul>").listview();
[09:47:18] <mikkelb> xmaddness: cool thanks man
[09:53:08] <shoky> ;p
[09:53:46] <arphen> maybe ill start ranting now
[09:53:58] <arphen> when i do "$("ul").listview()" i get an error
[09:54:08] <arphen> TypeError: Cannot read property 'jQuery16405001505266409367' of undefined
[09:54:10] <arphen> when i do it again
[09:54:12] <arphen> i get the same error
[09:54:15] <arphen> do it two more times
[09:54:16] <arphen> and it works
[09:54:19] <arphen> what the fuck
[09:54:37] <shoky> what's .listview
[09:54:58] <shoky> did you run it after DOM ready ?
[09:56:10] <arphen> yea of course
[09:56:16] <arphen> ah thats jquerymobile stuff
[09:56:39] <arphen> i fixed my problem by calling markup.listview(); 5 times in a row. now i get 4 errors and the fifth works
[09:56:56] <shoky> nah thats not fixing your problem
[09:59:40] <shoky> arphen: did you bind 'pageinit' ?
[10:01:57] <arphen> yeah i figured out my problem

[10:17:08] <phoenixson> is there a way in jquery to create a div whose content can be changed by a tab beneath the div
[10:26:49] <jaybuffet> this is probably real easy, but http://jsfiddle.net/HTJ5h/3/ ...  i want it so when you click btn1, it alerts "div2"
[10:27:15] <jaybuffet> when you click one button, its as ig another button was clicked
[10:27:16] <blendedbychris> is there another form of "appendTo" that appends to the innerhtml of the selected element?
[10:27:33] <blendedbychris> like appendToHtml() or somethe
[10:27:45] <johnkpaul> ?append @ blendedbychris
[10:27:45] <caniuse> blendedbychris: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[10:27:45] <ajpiano> blendedbychris: how is that different from a normal appendTo
[10:27:51] <ajpiano> oh right, append
[10:28:00] <johnkpaul> :)
[10:28:04] <ajpiano> well, still
[10:28:12] <ajpiano> ah yes
[10:28:15] <ajpiano> nm :|
[10:28:20] <blendedbychris> ah brain wasn't working
[10:29:29] <johnkpaul> jaybuffet: http://jsfiddle.net/HTJ5h/6/ ?
[10:31:15] <jaybuffet> so simple
[10:31:17] <jaybuffet> thank you
[10:33:53] <johnkpaul> jaybuffet: no problem
[11:13:31] <wraithguard01> Hello, is it possible, given an arbitrary id, to determine what jquery UI type (if any) an element is? So, for instance, if I do $("#id").dialog(), then later want to return "dialog" from "id".
[11:14:38] <gnarf> wraithguard01: not really
[11:14:47] <gnarf> wraithguard01: because it can be more than one
[11:14:48] <gnarf> however
[11:15:07] <gnarf> you could if ( "dialog" in $("#id").data )
[11:15:18] <gnarf> you could if ( $("#id").data("dialog") )
[11:15:30] <gnarf> and that first one is typoed
[11:15:36] <gnarf> so dont try
[11:15:53] <wraithguard01> Hmm, that's probably acceptable. I'll give that a shot, thanks!
[11:16:05] <gnarf> wraithguard01: the .data() object contains the "widget instance"
[11:16:07] <gnarf> so like
[11:16:07] <ezakimak> can you net test the prototype?
[11:16:12] <gnarf> .data().dialog
[11:16:19] <gnarf> is a dialog widget
[11:16:40] <gnarf> also
[11:16:47] <gnarf> i believe there is a selector
[11:16:49] * gnarf digs
[11:17:02] <gnarf> like $("#id").is( ":ui-dialog" )
[11:17:04] <gnarf> or something like that
[11:17:15] <gnarf> i don't do this often :)
[11:18:09] <wraithguard01> haha, that's ok. I'll dig, now that you've pointed me in the right direction
[11:20:28] <gnarf> ezakimak: and yeah - .data("dialog") instanceof $.ui.dialog is probably the SAFEST
[11:20:29] <gnarf> :)

[11:43:52] <imanc> is there a jquery app (not jqm) for turning all links into page transitions?  My client wants their site to sit on a single page with side swipe transitions.
[11:44:47] <Kingsy> question, if you have a function like this ---> http://pastie.org/4039597 <--- its basically a slideshow using backstretch.. how would you interupt that interval.. pass it a different array and start it again ?
[11:48:25] <ram9> I am curious about making a patch to jquery - .focus() doesn't work as expected on IE8 - it seems there is a convention to wrap a timeout around the call to get the browser to heed it. Wouldn't this be the kind of thing that would be helpful in jquery?
[11:51:26] <Jouva> Ugh, I'm stuck. I've found some image fading code but I wanted to expand on it. I want to take 3 images from a set of an unknown count of images, fade them out and fade in the next three
[11:52:04] <brancher> QUESTION: i'm facing a weird problem with AJAX requests. sending a PUT request to a rails app to atomic update some data in a model, i get a 200 OK response from rails, and i can actually see the updated data in database, but ajax is firing the ERROR callback. if i omit the error callback and pass a statusCode callback instead, it correctly fires the 200 option. in docs i read that error fires with request or data parsing errors, but i have no data comin

[11:52:49] <Jouva> And when I did stuff based on looping back and using :first, if I have 7 images I end up with something like: 0 1 2, 3 4 5, 6 0 1, 0 1 2 (instead of 2 3 4), since 0 is first
[11:54:02] <Jouva> How can I reference a specific element in a set of elements and then jump by X number of elements in a circular list type of way
[11:58:36] <brancher> Kingsy: isn't clearInterval() what you need?
[12:00:28] <danheberden> Jouva this might help with the math part: https://github.com/danheberden/snippets/blob/master/snippets.js#L22
[12:01:04] <Jouva> danheberden: Well I'm familiar with the use of modulus for that
[12:01:17] <danheberden> then nvm :)
[12:01:35] <Jouva> My issue is this:
[12:02:19] <wraithguard01> Hmm. I'm trying to dynamically call .option on a widget, and I'm making a method that will simply pass the arguements through, but I'm having trouble getting it to work. I'm using .apply() on the widget, but I'm not getting anything useful. I've tried using both $ and $('#id') as the first argument to apply, but no dice. Any ideas?
[12:02:45] <lukebrannon> is there a way to get the container tags when using .html() in jquery?
[12:03:49] <lukebrannon> i'm trying to clone a <tr> and need to update the ids, in the <tr> and child <td> tags
[12:05:29] <brancher> lukebrannon: what for are you using the .html()? paste some code here: pastie.org
[12:06:55] <someprimetime> how can i get the top position of the scrollbar? for some reason scrollTop() is giving me the bottom position of it, it seems
[12:06:59] <someprimetime> or maybe I'm just F'ing something up
[12:09:49] <brancher> someprimetime: $(window).scrollTop() should give you the vertical height not visible (above the top edge)
[12:10:11] <blendedbychris> what's the proper way to fade this in … $(this).find('.description').clone().appendTo('#message_description .placeholder');
[12:10:27] <blendedbychris> I tried .fadeIn() at the end and it doesn't seem to fade in
[12:11:10] <brancher> blendedbychris: you should hide it in first place.
[12:11:13] <someprimetime> blendedbychris: hide().fadeIn()
[12:11:18] <lukebrannon> brancher: http://pastie.org/4039731
[12:11:34] <someprimetime> brancher: is there a way to get the very top of the scrollbar? this is in a div with an overflow-y scroll on it
[12:11:44] <someprimetime> i just want to see when the scrollbar gets back to the very top
[12:12:03] <Kingsy> brancher: yeah I got it.. thanks
[12:12:24] <lukebrannon> the basic row structure is in the comments there…
[12:12:25] <blendedbychris> ah okay i'lld try that
[12:12:41] <lukebrannon> brancher: i need to replace row1 with row2 in that structure
[12:14:56] <brancher> someprimetime: i've never used it with divs and overflow-y. but maybe you are looking for $(item).offset().top, no?
[12:15:36] <brancher> lukebrannon: where row2 comes from?
[12:15:48] <kollapse> Hi. Is there any jquery plugin that offers lightweight yet customizable tooltips ?
[12:16:00] <brancher> you only need to clone row1, changing ids?
[12:16:19] <brancher> kollapse: tipsy
[12:17:23] <lukebrannon> i need to clone row1, update the part of the ids that include "row1" and remove any text from the <td> tags
[12:19:14] <lukebrannon> I thought it'd be easiest to use .html(), but that doesn't grab the <tr> tags
[12:19:48] * danheberden mutters "html templates"
[12:21:40] <kollapse> Hmm, can you delegate tooltips in `tipsy` ? I need to do dynamic tooltips for anything between 100 and 1000 elements.
[12:29:24] <kollapse> brancher: Tipsy is pretty old though (2008) - http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/tipsy

[12:34:03] <brancher> kollapse: i've been using it without issues. it's more or less maintained (check github: https://github.com/jaz303/tipsy) and is also the code base/inspiration for twitter bootstrap tooltip funcionalities. if you do prefer, you can use the bootstrap version: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tooltips

[12:37:27] <kollapse> brancher: Thanks, I'll try the bootstrap version, I always prefer newer / more maintained

[12:44:01] <brancher> johnkpaul: you mean if the response comes as json?
[12:44:14] <johnkpaul> yes
[12:44:27] <Cider> does anyone have a seed box here?
[12:44:42] <brancher> johnkpaul: yes, it comes as application/json [Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8]
[12:44:54] <johnkpaul> brancher: what is the error message?
[12:45:02] <brancher> parsererror
[12:45:20] <johnkpaul> and you're sure that it's valid json?
[12:45:39] <brancher> the return? i have no return. it's blank.
[12:45:45] <Cider> ok
[12:45:48] <brancher> just a head 200 status code
[12:46:05] <NoiseEee> brancher: see if you can lint/test the json response
[12:46:35] <brancher> there is no response, NoiseEee. even curling the url, it returns nothing.
[12:46:55] <brancher> more precisely: there is no response BODY. just headers.
[12:49:09] <johnkpaul> brancher: I don't believe an empty response is valid json
[12:49:13] <johnkpaul> {} would be
[12:49:55] <brancher> humm. will try it.
[12:54:44] <lukebrannon> brancher: thanks for looking at it, I will figure something out
[12:55:05] <brancher> johnkpaul: ok, got it working!
[12:55:14] <johnkpaul> brancher: great, how did you fix it
[12:56:04] <jenia> hello
[12:56:28] <brancher> asking rails to respond with a [] instead of no response body.
[12:56:29] <jenia> when i do $(".day").button(), all the nodes that are of class day become buttons
[12:56:59] <johnkpaul> brancher: ah ok, taht's also valid json
[12:57:31] <jenia> but when i do x=doucment.createNode("button");  x.button()
[12:57:35] <jenia> it does not work
[12:57:47] <brancher> sure, {} worked too
[12:58:13] <brancher> thanks you all!
[12:58:22] <jenia> how can i create a simple html element, and instantiate an object that can execute button()?
[12:59:10] <_trev> brancher, are you looking to execute a click action?
[12:59:33] <brancher> _trev: nope, why?
[12:59:38] <_trev> oops
[12:59:44] <_trev> i meant jenia
[12:59:46] <_trev> lol
[12:59:52] <_trev> jenia, , are you looking to execute a click action?
[13:00:31] <jenia> nono, i want to dynamically add a button to my page and call button() on the html element
[13:01:17] <NoiseEee> call "button()" on the element?
[13:01:21] <NoiseEee> what does that mena?
[13:01:23] <jenia> do i'm creating a button: document.createElement("button")
[13:01:28] <jenia> so*
[13:01:42] <jenia> and then i want to make that button into a jquery button
[13:02:13] <brancher> jenia: you are doing it wrong. do $("<button />") and it will return jquery button.
[13:02:35] <jenia> ummhumm okay thanks.
[13:02:49] <brancher> “jquery button” hehe
[13:05:55] <NoiseEee> jenia: you need to create the element as a jquery object, like ^^, then you can call UI stuff on it
[13:06:22] <jenia> thanks
[13:09:20] <billlazar> hi all, need a little help: inside the success callback of a $.post() I'm building a new DOM element using the returned data, I want to store data.content (which is a valid object) in a data- attribute, e.g., $(elem).append('<div data-product="+data.content+'">blah</div>')... the DOM element is appended but data-product is just '[object Object]'.
[13:11:11] <Brodingo> billlazar whats in data.content?
[13:11:28] <billlazar> Brodingo: data.content is a JSON object
[13:14:10] <Brodingo> billlazar an object literal is not the same as a string of JSON

[13:17:58] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks.
[13:18:04] <jonathancutrell> got a js optimization question for you.
[13:18:20] <jonathancutrell> I have an unordered list that's about 7500 nodes long.
[13:18:34] <jonathancutrell> The question is this.
[13:18:44] <jonathancutrell> I want to filter the nodes by text input.
[13:19:01] <jonathancutrell> Simply checking for indexOf in the html of that node is enough for me.
[13:19:22] <jonathancutrell> However, it's entirely too slow to just do this with $.each
[13:19:42] <NeilHanlon> Hey everyone. So, I'm trying to use jQuery UI to use a modal dialog box to confirm a user clicking a link. However, I obviously want to continue propogating the event if the users confirms their action... Is there some way I can access the mouseclick event from inside the initialization of the dialog box? Or, better yet, is there a better approach? Here's my current code (Yes, I know, extremely messy). http://jsfiddle.net/2zJgT/
[13:19:55] <jonathancutrell> planning on adding a "hidden" class to the LI if it doesn't match.
[13:20:34] <billlazar> NeilHanlon: check out jquery++, http://jquerypp.com/
[13:20:42] <jonathancutrell> is it better to do nothing if it doesn't match, and add a class to the parent ul "like 'searching'" and then hide all of those in css only, adding classes only to those that DO match?
[13:25:13] <NeilHanlon> billlazar, that's actually perfect, though it leaves me with the same issue: How do I pass the event object to the dialog box?
[13:26:30] <billlazar> NeilHanlon: IIRC they have pause and resume event functions, so you would set a handler on the link click event, do your thing and then resume the click handling. I believe the docs explain this in better detail than I can ;)
[13:28:01] <NeilHanlon> I think I found another way. They have a aSyncEvent method, which I can use to trigger the dialog box, and then handle it afterwards, along with the pause and resume methods. Thanks for the tip! I'll let you know if it works.
[13:28:14] <billlazar> good luck

[13:55:38] <aarobc_work> Hello, quick question: is it possible to use .find() to specify more than one condition somehow? like, $obj.find('a', 'div'); +?
[13:56:20] <Whirl3d> aarobc_work, can you be more specific. the answer is yes, but implementation depends on your exact needs
[13:57:05] <shel2l2y> or, how do i make jquery to post data
[13:57:41] <Whirl3d> shel212y, did you read the api for autocomplete? They give examples of it.
[13:58:45] <zeppo> anyone dealt with the issue that selectors are ignoring case sensitivity in IE8 and older?
[13:59:06] <aarobc_work> Whirl3d: I'm wanting to grab text from only specific input types, what is the correct syntax then? say I wanted for each <input> tag, and each <textarea> tag
[13:59:34] <Whirl3d> in that case, you could use the pseudo selector ":text"
[14:00:03] <Whirl3d> aarobc_work, I am pretty sure that will give you both input[type='text'] and textarea elements
[14:00:29] <_helpPlz_> is ":text" faster than "input, textarea"?
[14:00:37] <ezakimak> you could put a custom attr or css class on all the fields you want
[14:00:49] <Whirl3d> _helpPlz_, I doubt it
[14:00:58] <Whirl3d> but it is more specific
[14:01:02] <shel2l2y> Whirl3d, the api didnt really mentioned anything about post data
[14:01:27] <Whirl3d> in other words input[type='button'] will not be returned using :text whereas using input it would
[14:01:31] <ezakimak> $.post is a shortcut to $.ajax
[14:02:04] <ezakimak> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[14:03:14] <Whirl3d> aarobc_work, you could also just use the syntax $("input[type='text'], textarea");
[14:03:20] <aarobc_work> oh, thanks _helpPlz_, that was the syntax I was looking for
[14:04:31] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:04:43] <_helpPlz_> :P
[14:05:33] <jwg2s> Whirl3d: Tried it, runs really slow.  How would you hide/show the elements using $(":in-viewport") ?
[14:06:32] <Whirl3d> if ($(element).is(":in-viewport")) {$(element).show();} else {$(element).hide();}
[14:06:34] <Whirl3d> ?
[14:07:12] <Whirl3d> or better yet
[14:07:12] <jwg2s> would it be stupid to use this with waypoints?
[14:07:40] <Whirl3d> $("element:in-viewport").show(); $("element).not(":in-viewport").hide();
[14:08:01] <shel2l2y> how do i implement .post() into the jquery ui code for autocomplete?
[14:08:51] <Whirl3d> I just GOOGLED it, but does this help: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jqueryui-autocomplete-post-option-for-remote-request
[14:09:49] <shel2l2y> lolz, thanks Whirl3d
[14:09:50] <jwg2s> Whirl3d: i think my issue is somewhat more complicated because of other code… http://pastie.org/4040316
[14:11:39] <Whirl3d> jwg2s, no need to put the function (){}  in there. Callbacks are optional
[14:12:47] <jwg2s> Whirl3d: ok got rid of them.  it works going down, but once it's out of the viewport (out by the top) it doesn't set opacity to 0 again
[14:13:54] <Whirl3d> unfortunately, I am not at all familiar with the waypoint plugin
[14:14:23] <jwg2s> its basically something that executes when you hit a certain div or element
[14:14:26] <Whirl3d> and that's a might weird invocation method for it...I've never seen it done like that before so I am already at a disadvantage...lol
[14:14:26] <jwg2s> by scrolling
[14:14:29] <jwg2s> do i even need it?
[14:14:46] <jwg2s> i'm willing to start from scratch to fix this problem, not tied to waypoitns
[14:14:47] <Whirl3d> I use ariel fleischer's scrollTo plugin
[14:15:12] <jwg2s> I'm using that as well, can that do fadein/fadeout with viewport?
[14:15:13] <_helpPlz_> parallax scroll?
[14:15:17] <jwg2s> i don't care how i do it
[14:15:22] <heoa> How can I get DOM -object's data such as <li>GetMe</li>?
[14:15:47] <Whirl3d> you just need to bind a function to the scroll event
[14:15:49] <heoa> javascript dataset returns HTTP get but not right...
[14:15:55] <_helpPlz_> $("ul.className li").html()?
[14:16:11] <jwg2s> Whirl3d: I'm relatively new to javascript.. can you elaborate a little on that? sorry
[14:16:23] <jwg2s> Whirl3d: appreciate the helpp
[14:20:05] <jwg2s> Whirl3d: i'm doing it by class, so if i do what you said it makes all divs with class "slide" visible, i just want it do the one that is in the viewport, not all of them
[14:20:19] <heoa> How can I modify Li DOM -object?
[14:20:23] <jwg2s> http://pastie.org/4040382
[14:20:31] <aarobc_work> is there some method for knowing when an .each() operation has completed?
[14:20:32] <heoa> I mean UL-LI -block in DOm
[14:20:54] <Whirl3d> gimme a minute to make a fiddle for you
[14:22:31] <osirisx11> hi all
[14:24:09] <jwg2s> Whirl3d: thanks, i've been stuck on this all day
[14:24:57] <osirisx11> i know how to populate the h1 but how do i remove everything after the h1 (the ul, the p, everything else) the html might vary a bit, i am operating on several templates with jquery http://pastebin.com/nGnkciwq
[14:25:10] <osirisx11> i'd like something like $('h1').after().remove()
[14:25:53] <rodd> perhaps siblings?
[14:26:03] <Whirl3d> jwg2s, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/KC7QZ/2/
[14:26:38] <Whirl3d> if that doesn't work, it's at least close
[14:27:08] <Whirl3d> you could combine the two if statements in your scoll handler, but I just did it that way so it would be easier to read
[14:27:42] <jwg2s> Whirl3d: does this rely on visible instead of opacity?
[14:28:04] <Whirl3d> fade uses opacity and display:"none"
[14:28:04] <rodd> osirisx11: $( 'h1' ).siblings().remove();
[14:28:12] <jwg2s> ah ok
[14:28:16] <rodd> following your example
[14:29:56] <Whirl3d> now if you need to be keep the display of the elements for format reasons, you'll need to animate opacity
[14:30:02] <_helpPlz_> osirisx11, i think you are looking for .nextAll() ?
[14:31:44] <osirisx11> nextAll is perfect!! thanks a bunch _helpPlz_
[14:32:04] <Whirl3d> jwg2s, also, make sure you are attaching the scroll handler to the element that scrolls which may or may not be the slide parent
[14:32:18] <osirisx11> siblings() would return both proceeding and preceeding siblings?
[14:34:51] <_helpPlz_> osirisx11, sorry i couldn't see if you got my message or not.. i think you are looking for $("h1").nextAll().remove();
[14:35:34] <osirisx11> > nextAll is perfect!! thanks a bunch _helpPlz_
[14:35:43] <osirisx11> > siblings() would return both proceeding and preceeding siblings?
[14:36:02] <rodd> osirisx11: yes
[14:36:11] <osirisx11> yep that's what i needed, ty!
[14:36:23] <rodd> for previous / next, you use either next/nextAll prev/prevAll
[14:38:37] <prefixed> say I have a few dom elements that have a single class, A, associated with them. Then say I have another dom element which has class A, and a class B associated with it. How would I sort that particular DOM element out of the set?
[14:39:05] <cybuch> hi, shoky is here? :)
[14:40:26] <rodd> prefixed: using .not - $( '.a' ).not( '.b' )
[14:40:34] <rodd> there may be a more efficient way
[14:40:39] <prefixed> rodd thought so
[14:40:40] <prefixed> thanks
[14:41:17] <rodd> '.a:not(.b)'
[14:41:36] <prefixed> as it turns out, that is not the problem that I'm runningup against
[14:45:21] <Whirl3d> jwg2s, try this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/KC7QZ/4/
[14:46:00] <Whirl3d> I think you have to use opacity by itself (no fade) because display:"none" is going to affect your scrolling and layout
[14:47:14] <prefixed> Whirl3d I figured that issue out from last night btw
[14:47:54] <jwg2s> Whirl3d: no luck
[14:50:23] <Whirl3d> jwg2s, try this? http://jsfiddle.net/KC7QZ/5/
[14:50:52] <jwg2s> nothing shows up at all if it has class .slide
[14:51:02] <Whirl3d> I might be using .filter(function () ) wrong...
[14:51:20] <Whirl3d> are you using chrome?
[14:51:45] <Whirl3d> do you have  devtools or firebug openn so you can see the console output?
[14:53:32] <jonathancutrell> prefixed: You figure out what problem you're having?
[14:54:00] <prefixed> jonathancutrellwhich one?
[14:54:21] <Goopyo> how can I reload a page and do something in the new page?
[14:54:36] <jonathancutrell> prefixed: you were talking about the class filtering earlier
[14:54:48] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo: You'll have to be more specific
[14:55:15] <Goopyo> well jquery performs a json request, gets error/success message. I want to reload the page then show said message
[14:55:44] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo what do you mean by reload the page?
[14:55:56] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo: you're wanting to do things inside a callback.
[14:55:59] <Goopyo> refresh (get new page data)
[14:56:08] <Whirl3d> jwg2s, try this with your console open: http://jsfiddle.net/KC7QZ/6/
[14:56:24] <Whirl3d> and let me know what it says.
[14:56:30] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo: Well, are you wanting the whole page to refresh, or just certain parts? if it's the whole page, why are you using AJAX?
[14:56:45] <prefixed> jonathancutrell ah yes. I understand that. Unfortunately, my issue is further up my code.
[14:56:47] <Goopyo> well really only one div
[14:56:54] <Goopyo> didnt know I could do a partial refresh
[14:57:06] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo: That's the idea behind .load()
[14:57:09] <Goopyo> I guess you're right though , I should just do a post form submission
[14:57:21] <jonathancutrell> what's the bot for showing docs folks?
[14:57:31] <Whirl3d> Make sure that you are wrapping that in a $(document).ready(function () { //paste fiddle content}); located in a <script></script> element inside the head of your document (after loading the viewport and jquery scripts)
[14:58:34] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo so the concept is to do an ajax call, and you'll get data back. Are you getting json, or something else?
[14:58:49] <Whirl3d> jwg2s, but why are you setting opacity to 0 for elements outside the viewport?
[14:59:14] <Whirl3d> you need to make sure that your css states display:"block", opacity:0 to start or they'll never show
[14:59:17] <Goopyo> json but its all on my sever so I can do a form post too
[14:59:42] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo: Well, it makes more sense to do $.getJSON
[15:00:23] <Goopyo> right that works, and I get my json, but there are other values (like google generated charts, etc) that need to be updated which would be easiest to simply refresh that div
[15:00:59] <Goopyo> but refreshing would make me lose the json response
[15:01:20] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo: what are you refreshing it to? The same/current url?
[15:01:28] <Goopyo> yup
[15:02:03] <Goopyo> oh shit I could something like: $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container'); right?
[15:02:44] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo: oh. Well, you could just do $("#someDivID").load(window.location + " #someDivID");
[15:02:50] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo: ya
[15:03:18] <jonathancutrell> Goopyo: that may be window.location.href
[15:03:22] <Goopyo> oh alright that works. cool
[15:03:30] <Goopyo> thanks!
[15:05:02] <jonathancutrell> Yep, anytime
[15:06:17] <Whirl3d> custom events applied to elements using .bind don't bubble automatically do they? Can they be made to bubble?
[15:06:38] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d why would they need to?
[15:07:23] <KWhat_Work> is there a way to call the widget function without knowing the type?
[15:07:31] <Whirl3d> I would like to use .on to handle the custom event in the parent's context
[15:08:17] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, it's not so much a matter of _need_ to...lol but more like it would be convenient if they did.
[15:10:10] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d it was more of a question to get an understanding of what you're attempting
[15:10:20] <BinaryKitten> what are you calling your custom event?
[15:11:37] <Whirl3d> for example, in a gallery script that I am working on, it is possible to define a custom animation method for each element when it changes from "inactive" to "active"...so whereas I normally would handle the animation on the parent container, it suddenly became useful to bind the "enterStage" and "exitStage" events to the individual slides
[15:12:06] <BinaryKitten> could you not add a class to them?
[15:12:23] <BinaryKitten> or a data-custom="enterStage" to them?
[15:12:35] <BinaryKitten> and then use .on that way?
[15:12:46] <Whirl3d> how so?
[15:12:58] <BinaryKitten> ok let me think..
[15:13:07] <BinaryKitten> what do enterStage and exitStage do?
[15:13:38] <Whirl3d> see, now I do this:   $(slide).trigger("enterStage")  and the slide runs the custom animation that "reveals" the slide
[15:14:02] <Whirl3d> same with slide.trigger("exitStage");
[15:14:14] <BinaryKitten> could you not event/widget that?
[15:14:29] <BinaryKitten> so you have stage.stuff().enterStage(slide) ?
[15:15:53] <Whirl3d> my goal (though I am not afraid to abandon it based on your wisdom) was to avoid i nforming any element of more than it needed to know...so that way it could be used elsewhere
[15:16:12] <BinaryKitten> yep but "stage" is not an element
[15:16:20] <BinaryKitten> it's an object/api of your actions
[15:17:00] <Whirl3d> how do I inform all of my controls about it
[15:17:42] <Whirl3d> inside a slide, there could be a button that calls "nextSlide"....that's an easy bind to the parent slide...how do I inform the control inside the slide to look for the stage?
[15:17:50] <Whirl3d> the same stage that everyone else is using.
[15:18:11] <BinaryKitten> let me jsfiddle something quickly
[15:18:18] <BinaryKitten> might be completely off track
[15:18:19] <Whirl3d> you rock. Thanks for your input.
[15:19:03] <Whirl3d> I have wanted to centralize a bunch of these things, but I am always afraid that I can't address the common element in my controls...
[15:20:28] <Whirl3d> I could possibly extend the jquery namespace to include a function that says, the "stage" is the closest (".gallery").data('stage") to any element...then I could call methods on the stage that way...
[15:24:41] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d http://jsfiddle.net/mEGnt/
[15:25:06] <BinaryKitten> that's v1
[15:25:30] <suedoh> hi, anyone with jquerymobile experience here?
[15:26:44] <Whirl3d> wow I wish I could think originally like that.. I would have never known how to come up with that
[15:27:48] <suedoh> Whirl3d, :)
[15:28:08] <suedoh> I asked in jquerrymobile, it's quite slow... Thought I'd ask before I get into trouble since it might be off-topic
[15:28:13] <suedoh> Being very specific and all
[15:28:36] <Whirl3d> lol. Did I get on you about that before?
[15:29:16] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d
[15:29:18] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/mEGnt/1/
[15:29:51] <BinaryKitten> button accesses stage via .data
[15:30:52] <BinaryKitten> is there anything else you would like adding?
[15:31:38] <Whirl3d> How about this: I have about 1800 lines of code that you could write into about 30...lol Wanna go at it.? I am just kidding
[15:32:07] <Whirl3d> I have written so much code to do what you did in a couple of lines off the cuff.
[15:32:08] <Whirl3d> wow.
[15:32:13] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d the way things are at work.. i might take that up lol

[15:40:19] <relipse> BinaryKitten, yeah but what css do I change/add to make it look condensed and small?
[15:40:27] <relipse> i changed the font size but the spacing is still out of whack
[15:40:34] <Phoenixz> I need to have an $('.item').on('click') for existing and future elements. I tried (per documentation $().on('click', '.item', function(){}); but that does nothing.. What am I doing wrong?
[15:41:01] <Whirl3d> you need to assign the .on handler to the parent element of the your items
[15:41:40] <Phoenixz> Whirl3d: aaahhww... that was not very clear, or I really must have missed that in the manual... okay, trying..
[15:42:35] <relipse> i want to replace the input box with a jquery one, has this been done already?
[15:42:39] <Phoenixz> Whirl3d: more or less.. now it responds the first time, second time it doesnt..

[15:47:37] <BinaryKitten> 2 items cannot have the same id
[15:47:48] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: I know, but there should be only one..
[15:47:49] <BinaryKitten> as soon as you insert the 2nd item, there is 2
[15:48:12] <Phoenixz> The "Add another admin" button should only be at the last entry..
[15:48:31] <BinaryKitten> urm check your trs
[15:48:34] * johnline carries on playing chiptunes singing willy wonka's pure imagination in a really deep voices
[15:48:35] <BinaryKitten> only 1 adminrow
[15:48:44] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: So I make a clone of the last entry that has the button, then remove the button from that last one, then add the clone behind that last one..
[15:48:47] <BinaryKitten> that has the id
[15:49:23] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: $('.adminrow').last().clone(); should return a clone of the last tr, not?
[15:49:47] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: Clone of the last  <tr class="adminrow"> that is
[15:49:54] <BinaryKitten> yes
[15:50:04] <BinaryKitten> but tehre is only 1 tr with that class
[15:50:07] <BinaryKitten> and it's the 1st
[15:50:19] <BinaryKitten> http://pastebin.com/bhNqq6tM  is an updated one that should not have the id issue
[15:50:50] <BinaryKitten> also Phoenixz line 26 .. is doing what?
[15:51:06] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: well yeah, but pressing the button actually clones that one completely (with class)... I then remove the button from the last one (the first time there is only one, so that one is the last)... then I add the clone WITH the button after the last..
[15:52:08] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: $('.admin', newAdmin).val();  makes sure that the clone <input> has no value.. if somebody typed text in there, then I clone it, and insert it at the end, then the clone would have that same text..
[15:53:17] <BinaryKitten> also that is all pointless delegation
[15:53:32] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: When I click the button, it correctly clones, I have 2 rows with class "adminrow", the button is only at the last one.. the only problem is that its not listening to the button click anymore
[15:53:35] <BinaryKitten> as it binds only to the 1st .crs_tlt
[15:54:10] <BinaryKitten> Phoenixz change $('.crc_tlt').on   to $('.crc_bob_tbl').on
[15:54:13] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: ah crap, yeah.. I clone that one too.. I should go up a bit higher then, the table, not?
[15:54:20] <BinaryKitten> yep
[15:54:40] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: those class names were not my idea :)
[15:54:51] <BinaryKitten> Phoenixz no worries
[15:54:57] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: Works! sweet, thanks!

[15:56:36] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: quick question: If I do var admin = $('.admin'); can I then do admin.val(); or would I have to do $(admin).val(); ?

[15:58:54] <BinaryKitten> hey Adam
[15:59:07] <suedoh> hi, is there a place for jquery consultants to find them?
[15:59:24] <BinaryKitten> suedoh no but there probably should be lol
[15:59:32] <BinaryKitten> consultants.jquery.com
[15:59:47] <suedoh> yea, that'd be cool
[16:00:19] <suedoh> anyone familiar with jquerymobile and doing ui/ux interested in 2 hours of their time, please PM me
[16:02:00] <Phoenixz> BinaryKitten: Thanks! Always nice to see other interpretation :)
[16:02:57] <BinaryKitten> Phoenixz the rule of thumb is to scan the dom when required
[16:03:01] <BinaryKitten> and only when required
[16:03:51] <BinaryKitten> right. since all is quiet
[16:04:02] <BinaryKitten> I'm going to get a drink and retire for the evening
[16:04:07] <BinaryKitten> gnight one and all,
[16:04:17] <BinaryKitten> $('#binarykitten').hide();
[16:04:57] <Whirl3d> gnite BinaryKitten, thanks a lot for your help
[16:11:33] <Silne30> Hello. I am new to webdev and jQuery. I have a question about the dialog widgit for jQuery UI.
[16:12:51] <Silne30> I noticed that it doesn't work exactly like an alert does. So if I want the content only showed at certain times would I hide the div element on $(document).ready()
[16:13:02] <Whirl3d> I swear, there must be a class somewhere and everyone in the class gets assigned the same homework...roughly to come to this channel and ask about the same thing that day. What do you want to bet tomorrow it will be jqueryUI tabs instead of Dialog? LOL
[16:13:44] <herpderp1000> haha
[16:14:08] <Whirl3d> you could use css to hide the element and then when you want to show it, manually change the display property
[16:14:40] <Silne30> Makes sense.
[16:14:56] <KWhat_Work> Silne30: class="ui-helper-hidden"
[16:15:29] <Silne30> I was fine using Javascript alerts but I let a professional developer see my capstone project and he kept saying that the alerts were ugly. So I figured it was a good thing to research.
[16:15:33] <Silne30> Thanks KWhat_Work.
[16:15:46] <herpderp1000> Wouldn't $('#dialogBox').dialog({autoOpen: false}); do the same thing?
[16:16:01] <KWhat_Work> tru ^^
[16:17:04] <Silne30> Thanks for all of the input.
[16:18:57] <Silne30> It's interesting combining jQuery with ASP.NET AJAX.
[16:19:10] <inwedes> hello, maybe somebody here can explain me a detail of jquery, i cant find any advice with google
[16:20:28] <KWhat_Work> inwedes: is there a question buried somewhere in that statement?
[16:20:40] <inwedes> when loading jquery on the bottom of a page, before </body> no inline script works anymore, but i read $(function() ... is equal to dom.ready
[16:21:39] <inwedes> so why some script, for example to get a jquery ui button works only when written after the <script tag that loads the jquery file
[16:21:51] <KWhat_Work> inwedes: my guess is you have a js error somewhere... probably caused by trying to call a jquery function before the js file is loaded ...
[16:22:36] <inwedes> yes, excatly that is what i try to understand
[16:22:47] <KWhat_Work> inwedes: i believe that $( is a jquery thing not a javascript thing
[16:23:09] <inwedes> why a js file have to be referenced bevor the script.. after dom.,ready all files are loaded, or i'm thinking wrong?
[16:23:19] <aberrant> hi all
[16:23:24] <ezakimak> $ is the name of the jquery object. it is undefined before jquery.js is loaded
[16:23:34] <aberrant> is it ok to have more than one $(document).ready(function() …) statement on a page?
[16:23:55] <ezakimak> i've done it
[16:24:10] <aberrant> ezakimak: but is it OK? :)
[16:24:10] <ezakimak> seemed to work
[16:24:14] <aberrant> haha
[16:24:20] <aberrant> "if it works, it's OK :) )
[16:24:21] <KWhat_Work> i to am guilty
[16:24:25] <aberrant> ok
[16:24:29] <aberrant> so all of them will fire?
[16:24:30] <ezakimak> afaik $(document) is just a selector like any other
[16:24:48] <inwedes> can somebody explain me how a browser is loading the files, executing the files and than starting to executing javascripts ifself
[16:25:05] <KWhat_Work> inwedes: they are loaded in order top down
[16:25:08] <Silne30> Do most of you work with the LAMP or WINS Stack?
[16:25:36] <ezakimak> inwedes, the simplest approach is pretend <script src=...> is just a cut-n-paste--the reference source file is literally pasted right there at that spot
[16:25:47] <ezakimak> and then it is parsed by the js vm
[16:25:49] <KWhat_Work> Silne30: doesnt matter, jquery executes on the client ;)
[16:26:03] <inwedes> @KWhat_Work: i'm only trying to understand, my stuff is working, but i would like to understand why it is and why in other way not
[16:26:09] <ezakimak> so the js vm sees the scripts in the order you place their <script> tags
[16:26:12] <Silne30> It was just a poll to see who does what.
[16:26:34] <ezakimak> Silne30, neither here :)
[16:26:48] <tw2113> oh polling
[16:27:04] * ezakimak has used LAMP in the past
[16:27:12] <herpderp1000> ezakimak: Right, if you wanted to do any jQuery stuff you'd need jQuery to be loaded first.
[16:27:28] <tw2113> you mean i need to have jQuery before i can use jquery?
[16:27:37] <tw2113> get real :P
[16:28:03] <Silne30> I am learning both in school. More LAMP than anything else. I am just wondering what is really being used out there.
[16:28:04] <KWhat_Work> $.widget _create has no return val does it...
[16:28:22] <herpderp1000> tw2113: haha, sure but obviously this is an issue :P
[16:28:29] <ezakimak> Silne30, a bit of everything, tons of LAMP, but also tons of other stuff also
[16:28:47] <ezakimak> LAMP is a pretty low entry barrier--thus the popularity
[16:28:56] <tw2113> http://royal.pingdom.com/2011/09/16/microsoft-iis-web-server-market-share-loss/
[16:29:10] <herpderp1000> iis still exists?
[16:29:39] <ryanaz> shey gusy...
[16:29:41] <ezakimak> if you want to up your game try python or lisp on your server, and have more than SQL in your toolbelt
[16:29:42] <tw2113> i think microsoft still uses it
[16:29:42] <ryanaz> hey guys..
[16:30:09] <KWhat_Work> iis is for people that need check boxes to configure a web server.
[16:30:29] <ezakimak> lighttpd, nginx, hunchentoot, antiweb...
[16:30:38] <ezakimak> tornado
[16:31:06] <ezakimak> all better than iis imo
[16:31:24] <KWhat_Work> does $.widget have a base object?
[16:31:44] <ezakimak> $.widget.__prototype__ ?
[16:31:46] <Silne30> Welp...my capstone project is being deployed to none other than IIS.
[16:31:48] <Silne30> Great.
[16:31:58] * KWhat_Work is stuck between a rock and a hard place 
[16:32:01] <ezakimak> you can deploy it on something else no doubt
[16:32:13] <ezakimak> but iis does work
[16:32:55] <Silne30> We have to work with constraints. If we use the WINS stack, we have to deploy to IIS, LAMP: Apache.
[16:32:58] <herpderp1000> Silne30 Get out while you're still ahead
[16:33:11] <ezakimak> why not run apache on windows?
[16:33:14] <ezakimak> works great.
[16:33:27] <Silne30> It does. But it's not my choice.
[16:33:30] <herpderp1000> Silne30: But really, IIS, Apache, Lighthttp, Node, whatever -- the type of webserver you have has nothing to do with javascript
[16:33:44] <ezakimak> well, if you don't have to configure it, doesn't really matter. php doesn't care.
[16:33:44] <Silne30> This is true, herpderp1000.
[16:33:59] <Silne30> I am just making conversation at this point. I learn from asking the people that do it for  living.
[16:34:11] <Silne30> The professors are useless. The take your money and hate talking to you.
[16:34:20] <Silne30> Most of the students are worse off than me.
[16:34:26] <Silne30> So I come talk to the pros.
[16:34:30] <Silne30> When I can anyways.
[16:35:01] <KWhat_Work> var obj .mywidget().mywidget('widget') ... AWESOME
[16:35:01] <ezakimak> well, that alone will help you go a long ways. being resourceful is key to learning more
[16:35:25] * ezakimak can't believe how many people don't bother to even google or look at docs first
[16:35:39] * ezakimak is a fan of lmgtfy.com lol
[16:36:12] <herpderp1000> Yeah. You won't get any value out of high-level programming in school. You're better off learning the fundamentals.
[16:36:14] <aJacom> hi. I'm trying to remove a title from a slide. The slider doesn't have specific classes so I can't target it properly. I'm trying with jQuery("ul#slider1.bxSlider li:nth-child(1) a.slide-title").remove; but it doesn't work. Doing it in the console outputs some kind of function (a,b){for(var c=0,d;(d=this[c])!=... code
[16:36:23] <ezakimak> i had classmates that woludn't even try to figure stuff out w/o just askin someone else first
[16:36:36] <Silne30> I do look at docs and google. I actually came here from the jQuery site with one of those between the line questions.
[16:36:37] <ezakimak> you can't do that on a job
[16:36:42] * Whirl3d has a hard time believing most of the crap that comes out of google's results
[16:36:50] <jenia> when i use the gotoCurrent for datepicker, it has no effect of the widget
[16:37:21] <Silne30> I hear you loud and clear, ezakimak.
[16:37:27] <ezakimak> it's all about getting good at knowing what the "right" question to ask are
[16:37:28] <jenia> i do it like this: $('.class').datepicker({gotoCurrent:true});
[16:37:51] <jenia> so i expect the datepicker not to highlight the current date after the user has picked a date
[16:37:53] <Silne30> I had a guy that would always say to me: "It's still giving me an error. I will pastebin it to you."
[16:37:55] <herpderp1000> aJacom: jQuery.remove is a function, therefore you need to run jQuery(element).remove(); When you just run remove it returns the function itself
[16:37:59] <jenia> how do i do that??
[16:38:50] <ezakimak> jenia, when I try it it always comes up to today regardless
[16:39:02] <aJacom> herpderp1000, Oh. Thanks.
[16:39:23] <aJacom> herpderp1000, But it's still not targetting the element properly. (It doesn't work )
[16:39:45] <aJacom> herpderp1000, No, it did. Thank you
[16:39:52] <Silne30> I asked him, "do you read the error?" He says "Why would I do that?"
[16:39:53] <jenia> yea me too
[16:40:10] <herpderp1000> aJacom: jQuery's selector (sizzle) can get a bit iffy when you get extremely specific. But glad it worked!
[16:40:15] <ezakimak> jenia, you might be able to do it via modifying the css class on the date cell for today
[16:40:30] <ezakimak> (ugly hack possibly)
[16:40:38] <jenia> oh yea. thanks ezakimak
[16:40:53] <herpderp1000> TO EVERYONE IN THIS CHAT ROOM, learn JavaScript, not just jQuery. That is all.
[16:41:24] <KWhat_Work> lol
[16:41:46] <Whirl3d> what is the irc command for seen?
[16:41:46] <yi> hi, i'm using $('#div').load('html_file.html') to dynamically load some content
[16:41:50] <aberrant> hm
[16:42:00] <aberrant> styling select elements is not trivial
[16:42:13] <Whirl3d> is it / seen? or ? seen? or was that a bot providing the function...lol
[16:42:14] <yi> however when i change the html_file.html and refresh my browser the changes don't seem to take into effect
[16:42:28] <yi> even a force refresh doesn't seem to solve the problem in chrome at least
[16:43:46] <herpderp1000> yi: do you have any info on the request headers? it could be getting cached persistently
[16:44:02] <yi> herpderp1000: i think i asked too soon -- i was able to get it to work by opening developer tools
[16:44:07] <Whirl3d> you can put a hash on the end of your url and it might help....url?justReload=now
[16:44:11] <yi> and selecting "disable cache"
[16:44:14] <yi> (in chrome)
[16:44:18] <yi> now it seems to work alright
[16:44:35] <Whirl3d> *query string...not hash
[16:44:57] <ezakimak> Whirl3d, sounds like a bot
[16:45:14] <Whirl3d> the seen thing?
[16:45:23] <shoky> jenia: that option is only for where the 'today' link goes to if you have the button bar enabled
[16:46:00] <ezakimak> Whirl3d, yes
[16:46:35] <jenia> ahh okay.
[16:47:05] <ezakimak> jenia, the css class on it are  ui-state-default ui-state-highlight
[16:47:44] <ezakimak> so just remove the ui-state-highlight class and i think you'll be good
[16:47:49] <jenia> so when  the user chooses a day i should change the name of the class for those element?
[16:47:51] <jenia> yea thanks
[16:48:13] <Whirl3d> !lastseen coldhead
[16:48:23] <ezakimak> i thought all you wanted was to *not* highlight today/
[16:48:25] <ezakimak> ?
[16:49:23] * coldhead is here right now, Whirl3d 
[16:49:47] <Whirl3d> HEY! I missed you the last several days How have you been?
[16:50:22] <Whirl3d> was that a really slow response from the server and not coldhead himself, LOL?
[16:50:48] <coldhead> i've been working like a fiend, Whirl3d
[16:50:59] <coldhead> anything good going on?
[16:51:09] <Whirl3d> cool. Didn't mean to interrupt. Nothing new really, just missed your sense of humor...
[16:51:30] <coldhead> aw i'll see what i can do
[16:51:50] <coldhead> i have mostly been a hot frustrated teary mess
[16:51:53] <coldhead> you know how it goes
[16:52:04] <Whirl3d> get your work done first. I just didn't want you to drop off...you know what I mean. LOL
[16:52:36] <Whirl3d> anything I could do to help, I mean do you need someone with a first grade education to help?
[16:52:59] <raisman> Hi guys, is it possible to do something like $('#element img').attr('src' , next.src); instead of $('#element img').attr('src' , this.src); ?
[16:53:42] <Whirl3d> raisman, if by that you mean next has some significance and isn't just a variable name, kind of.
[16:54:00] <raisman> Whirl3d: I need to get the next element's src attr
[16:54:22] <raisman> im trying to use jquery cycle with next and previous buttons but with a thumbnail of the next and previous img within the button
[16:54:42] <Whirl3d> you would need to do something like $("#element img").attr("src', $("#element").next("img").attr('src'));
[16:55:30] <raisman> Whirl3d: got ya, hadn't thought of that! Looks like it will work :) thanks
[16:55:43] <Whirl3d> I think that jquery cycle has options to enable thumbnail navigation or helper navigation like that.
[16:56:10] <raisman> yeah its awesome, but it has the option to use all of the thumbnails at once
[16:56:54] <raisman> Just wanted to use next and previous thumb image, and couldn't find anything about that so I came up with this and the before option
[16:56:54] <raj> I can't replicate this scenario, where inside a $.each, I can't access any variables in the parent scope
[16:57:03] <raj> i was trying to make a testcase in jsfiddle
[16:57:33] <Whirl3d> raj, perhaps you are overwriting the variable reference inside your each
[16:57:52] <dizzyone> Hello, question: I want to run a function when multiple ajax request have all succeeded, I was wondering if there is a good way to approach this. I was thinking of maybe some kind of eventlistener?
[16:58:05] <raj> Whirl3d, I'm not
[16:58:13] <Whirl3d> dizzyone, lookup .when
[16:58:21] <dizzyone> thank you :)
[16:58:46] <Whirl3d> raj, hallucinating then? post a link to the source if you can't fiddle it.
[17:01:08] <ryanaz> is there a command like dialog() to just put the dialog() outer rounded border around the <div> ?
[17:01:35] <ryanaz> i'm trying to use dialog() but it's not playing nicely with the rest of the page with the positioning
[17:01:53] <ryanaz> especially on the iphone.  If I zoom in with the iphone the elements on the page fly all over the place
[17:02:05] <Whirl3d> ryanaz, just copy the classes necessary to style the element
[17:02:19] <ryanaz> Whirl3d:  hmm..
[17:03:23] <Whirl3d> and its gonna be ugly...about 50 of them all looking like ui-widget-top-border-rounded-with-my-thumb-in-my-ass
[17:05:58] <dizzyone> Whirl3d, is a getJSON() also a deferred object?
[17:07:21] <Whirl3d> should be. if not you could make it one really easy
[17:07:57] <aborady> i need experts openions and comments in this site that i built www.mahmoudabdelaziz.net
[17:08:29] <aborady> plz kindly feed me back
[17:08:36] <Whirl3d> var defr=$.Deferred(); $.getJSON(url, {success:function (data) {defr.resolve(data);},error:function () {defr.reject();} return (defr.promise());
[17:09:21] <aberrant> hi all.
[17:09:24] <aberrant> I have this: 	$('td').has('ul.errorlist').css('background','red');
[17:09:51] <aberrant> what I really want is the <input> in there to have the red background . How do I reference the input inside the <td> ?
[17:10:18] <tw2113> $('td input') ?
[17:10:27] <ezakimak> $('td ul.errorlist input')
[17:10:37] <tw2113> that'd probably work too
[17:10:44] <aborady> can anybody gimmi notes comments and openion in this website? www.mahmoudabdelaziz.net
[17:10:44] <aberrant> the issue is that the selector is correct: td has ul
[17:11:01] <aberrant> input doesn't have ul
[17:11:48] <aberrant> it looks like <td><ul class='errorlist'>….</ul><input …> </input></td>
[17:12:51] <aberrant> aborady: it doesn't work well with small browser widths
[17:12:51] <tw2113> i get the feeling .sibling() may help
[17:12:52] <Whirl3d> aborady, overall, I think the site looks nicer than most. There's a little too much slidiing going on and it doesn't translate well into English (layout issues). I don't like the progress bar at the bottom of the page, it's distracting. But it scales nicely on a large monitor--which is not the norm
[17:13:12] <iamamoron> hi there i created an iframe on the fly pop it out as dialog, how can i post data on it?
[17:13:14] <iamamoron> any ideas?
[17:13:24] <aberrant> if I narrow my browser, the "press" link disappears
[17:13:30] <iamamoron> i can do get but problem is I am sending large data
[17:13:36] <iamamoron> get cannot handle it anymore
[17:13:41] <ezakimak> tw2113, it's a descendant, not a sibling i think
[17:13:43] <aberrant> tw2113: can you give me more specific advice?
[17:14:08] <dizzyone> thank you Whirl3d :)
[17:14:09] <iamamoron> ?
[17:14:11] <Whirl3d> iamamoron, I don't think you can do that if its cross-domain
[17:14:11] <aberrant> I think <input> is a sibling of errorlist
[17:14:12] <iamamoron> any ideaS?
[17:14:13] <tw2113> depends on what you're attaching the sibling part on
[17:14:19] <iamamoron> nop
[17:14:20] <iamamoron> its not
[17:14:33] <iamamoron> its not cross domain
[17:15:01] <Whirl3d> shoot, I thought that was going to be it...I have never used iframes, so I'm no help, sorry.
[17:15:34] <iamamoron> ?
[17:15:46] <ezakimak> aberrant, $('td:has(p.errorlist) input').css('background-color', 'red') ?
[17:15:50] <aberrant> I got it
[17:15:56] <iamamoron> how to post data on an iframe on the fly created as dialog?
[17:16:00] <aberrant> ezakimak: $('td ul.errorlist').siblings().css('background','red');
[17:16:37] <aborady> whirl3d, thanks so much i appreciate ur help and i'll take you comments in mind , i understood it but what you think the language problem cause ?
[17:16:38] <ezakimak> that really worked?
[17:16:47] <aberrant> yeah :)
[17:16:52] <aberrant> ezakimak: it was a blind-assed guess
[17:16:54] <iamamoron> hello?
[17:16:54] <aberrant> but it worked
[17:17:59] <ezakimak> i'm not sure that's doing what you want
[17:18:09] <aberrant> ezakimak: how so?
[17:18:23] <iamamoron> hello?
[17:18:31] <scathen^C> hey guys, can anyone tell me why an inline div style for width&height works, but width&height attributes don't??
[17:19:04] <aberrant> ezakimak: the <input> is a sibling of the ul, no?
[17:19:08] <eip56> evening all
[17:19:10] <ezakimak> oh, nm. it does--kinda aproaches it sideways
[17:19:15] <ezakimak> yep.
[17:19:15] <iamamoron> fdmkl;dgdfgdfgdfgkmjdf;g
[17:19:16] <iamamoron> fgkfdgj;fdg
[17:19:17] <iamamoron> fdgdfgmdf;gdf
[17:19:18] <iamamoron> fdgdfjgl;fdjgfd
[17:19:18] <ezakimak> i just realized that
[17:19:19] <iamamoron> fgfgl;dfkjg
[17:19:22] <iamamoron> fuck
[17:19:23] <aberrant> iamamoron: stop that please
[17:19:28] <systemfault> scathen^C: Because a div doesn't have a width and height attribute...
[17:19:31] <styol> scathen^C: div's dont have the height and width attributes
[17:19:43] <ezakimak> iamamoron, you may need to be more specific
[17:19:59] <scathen^C> aahhh thanks, well that sucks.
[17:19:59] <aberrant> ezakimak, tw2113: thanks for the help :)
[17:20:08] <aberrant> siblings() saved the day
[17:20:13] <scathen^C> anyone mind if i vent?
[17:20:26] <imanc> is it common to couple backbone with jquery?
[17:20:28] <ezakimak> aberrant, for kicks and giggles try the solution i found
[17:20:30] <scr3am> hey guys, need quick help, can please test anybody this link with IE8 PLEASE... http://davidpottrell.co.uk/test/
[17:20:33] <raisman> Whirl3d: No luck with the "before" option. It only works once :/  I'm looking at the options here http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html but i'm not sure which one fires an event after a slide element has passed or something like that
[17:20:35] <ezakimak> (s/p./ul./ of course)
[17:20:37] <systemfault> imanc: Yes...
[17:20:45] <imanc> nice
[17:20:49] <aberrant> ezakimak: this one?  $('td:has(p.errorlist) input').css('background-color', 'red')  ? one sec
[17:21:01] <ezakimak> yeh, but fix the p  of course
[17:21:07] <iamamoron> i created an i frame on the fly and display it like dialog, my problem is hwo to post data onto that iframe
[17:21:12] <iamamoron> any fucking ideas?
[17:21:14] <scr3am> if there is anybody running IE at all ;-)
[17:21:22] <systemfault> coldhead
[17:21:22] <caniuse> systemfault: coldhead: a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[17:21:31] <ezakimak> iamamoron, you mean after it's displayed? or as it's created?
[17:21:31] <aberrant> ezakimak: it worked
[17:21:35] <ezakimak> ok. good to know.
[17:21:46] <ezakimak> wow. jq has very powerful selectors
[17:21:47] <aberrant> ezakimak: I like yours better
[17:21:56] <iamamoron> because the page in the iframe should display i have posted
[17:22:04] <aberrant> ezakimak: gonna keep it - it's very specific instead of grabbing all siblings
[17:22:11] <iamamoron> before it is created
[17:22:16] <ezakimak> well, you only had the one sibling though, right?
[17:22:22] <ezakimak> i wonder which is actually faster
[17:22:25] <iamamoron> that i frame also should display what i have posted
[17:22:30] <aberrant> ezakimak: yes, but this is much more specific
[17:22:34] <iamamoron> ezakimak: any ideas?
[17:23:00] <ezakimak> are you specifying the source url for the iframe's content?
[17:23:16] <ezakimak> that could be a small html page w/a dummy script that calls back
[17:23:57] <iamamoron> yes i am
[17:24:00] <iamamoron> specifying
[17:24:11] <ezakimak> you might wanna look at some old ajax libary code that used the hidden-iframe technique and see how they talked between the two
[17:24:32] <iamamoron> $('<iframe id="myid" style="float:none" frameborder="0" src="mypage.php" />').dialog({
[17:24:33] <ezakimak> (pre xmlhttprequest days)
[17:24:52] <iamamoron> that is how i created the ifram
[17:24:55] <iamamoron> it is a dialog now
[17:25:03] <iamamoron> i need to send data on it
[17:25:06] <iamamoron> i can do get
[17:25:18] <iamamoron> but having params at the end of src
[17:25:24] <iamamoron> but i have large data
[17:25:28] <iamamoron> get cannot handle
[17:25:34] <iamamoron> i really have to use post
[17:25:49] <ezakimak> mypage.php is the source of the data itself?
[17:26:09] <iamamoron> nope
[17:26:16] <iamamoron> mypagemain.php
[17:26:23] <ezakimak> it's just the wrapper/template for displaying the result?
[17:26:26] <iamamoron> is the one how pops out the mypage
[17:27:02] <ezakimak> i think, you may just use $.post() and have the result pass the data to whatever in your dialog iframe
[17:27:02] <iamamoron> i really have to post it there because i need to transac based in that new popout window
[17:27:54] <aberrant> holy hell my website is nice
[17:27:58] <shoky> scr3am: it works in IE8. anything specific you wanted to test?
[17:28:05] <iamamoron> ezakimak: : huh?
[17:28:07] <iamamoron> i dont get it
[17:28:10] <ezakimak> iamamoron, oh, oh, how about this
[17:28:14] <aberrant> it's probably gonna look like crap in IE though
[17:28:29] <ezakimak> make a hidden form and use target and submit it
[17:29:34] <iamamoron> what_
[17:29:36] <iamamoron> ?
[17:30:20] <ezakimak> <form target="_iframe-window-name" ... ?
[17:30:42] <raisman> How can I make that each time I click on the next button on this example the thumbnail img adds + 1 on the .next selector so that the first image doesnt repeat all the time?
[17:30:51] <raisman> whoops missed the link http://jsfiddle.net/TnLYq/6/
[17:32:14] <ezakimak> iamamoron, if you have to do it from the iframe, then the mypage.php wrapper needs it's own jquery script, no?
[17:32:38] <ezakimak> and just $.post() it from it's own $(document).ready()
[17:34:14] <wavez> I have a design issue that I need help with. I'm trying to put jQuery progress bars into a jqGrid. I've been able to make it work using a custom formatter, and also using the gridComplete() function, but both methods have a problem.
[17:34:15] <wavez> http://jsfiddle.net/wavez/Xb4n5/12/
[17:34:47] <wavez> since I'm loading local data using addRowData, gridComplete() gets called after every row is added.
[17:35:05] <wavez> So then the progress bars get added again to the existing lines.
[17:35:14] <ezakimak> so store a counter?
[17:35:34] <ezakimak> if (!_pg_added) { add it, _pg_added = true; }
[17:37:18] <scr3am> shoky: THX, just wanted to know if it works, many thx
[17:37:35] <raj> any reason why I can't access variables outside of $.each() unless they are global?
[17:37:36] <iamamoron> ezakimak: : base on my code
[17:37:43] <iamamoron> $('<iframe id="myid" style="float:none" frameborder="0" src="mypage.php" />').dialog({
[17:37:46] <iamamoron> how to post on it
[17:37:53] <raj> I don't otherwise have this issue
[17:38:01] <raj> so not sure what's causing it
[17:38:36] <ezakimak> iamamoron, do you mean to replace the entire contents of your iframe w/the result of the post?
[17:38:50] <iamamoron> no I just want to send data
[17:38:54] <wavez> ezakimak, where do I store the counter? In my grid object somehow? I'm new to JS.
[17:39:14] <iamamoron> so that I can put the data in mypage at iframe
[17:40:45] <iamamoron> ezakimak: ?
[17:40:59] <wavez> ezakimak, gridComplete() is called again when the sort order is changed on the grid, so the counter would have to be reset after the data is finished being loaded.
[17:41:12] <ezakimak> iamamoron, thinking
[17:42:43] <ezakimak> wavez, hrm. a good puzzle
[17:43:14] <ezakimak> iamamoron, i guess i don't fully understand the problem
[17:43:21] <wavez> http://jsfiddle.net/wavez/Xb4n5/12/
[17:43:23] <iamamoron> ezakimak: why?
[17:43:36] <ezakimak> you can $.post() anything you want, and do whatever you want w/the result
[17:43:37] <iamamoron> i created an iframe on the fly through this
[17:43:48] <iamamoron> $('<iframe id="myid" style="float:none" frameborder="0" src="mypage.php" />').dialog({
[17:44:07] <iamamoron> now any methods i could use so that i can post to mypage.php?
[17:44:55] <iamamoron> mypage is a different page
[17:45:11] <iamamoron> i need to show inside mypage what i have posted from other file
[17:45:14] <ezakimak> iamamoron, $.post("mypage.php", { the data ... }, success_handler... )
[17:46:06] <ezakimak> success_handler can be function(data) { get_handle_to_iframe().doSomethingWithData(data); }
[17:46:29] <iamamoron> ezakimak: : that i now the point
[17:46:35] <iamamoron> that inot the point
[17:46:44] <iamamoron> mypage should display what i have posted
[17:46:52] <iamamoron> there should not be any call back
[17:47:04] <ezakimak> wait, you want it to show the actual HTTP post going out?
[17:47:12] <ezakimak> or just the data you're about to send?
[17:47:32] <ezakimak> or you want it to echo back what you posted?
[17:47:44] <iamamoron> i dont want to echo back
[17:47:57] <iamamoron> just like a normal submit
[17:48:13] <iamamoron> but i need to display what i have submitted to the new popup window
[17:48:25] <ezakimak> before or after it actually crosses the wire?
[17:49:02] <iamamoron> aftyer
[17:49:04] <iamamoron> after
[17:49:10] <iamamoron> i mean
[17:49:17] <kbanman> Any ideas why calling .focus() on an input element would be ineffective?
[17:49:22] <GPR> Hi, http://pastebin.com/fN1gAg2W is there a reason line 67 wouldnt work when an image or paragraph is clicked? It works with the h3..
[17:49:22] <iamamoron> imagine a normal post
[17:49:24] <iamamoron> no i frame
[17:49:25] <ezakimak> iamamoron, how is that not echoing it back?
[17:49:41] <iamamoron> when you save submit it you will go the page
[17:49:45] <iamamoron> you are submitting
[17:49:58] <iamamoron> just like that
[17:50:11] <systemfault> Your nickname suits you very well...
[17:50:17] <iamamoron> in my case I am submitting it to the i frame
[17:50:27] <iamamoron> so that it may look like a new window
[17:50:31] <iamamoron> now a page redirection
[17:50:59] <raj> shoky?
[17:51:12] <iamamoron> systemfault: : no its just that you dont get  it
[17:51:18] <ezakimak> is the data coming from a visible form? or hidden js data?
[17:51:30] <iamamoron> visible form
[17:51:42] <ezakimak> so the user is clicking "submit"?
[17:51:42] <systemfault> I totally get it :) You're just an idiot who cannot use google.
[17:52:02] <iamamoron> systemfault: : i think my nick suits you
[17:52:06] <systemfault> :)
[17:52:11] <ezakimak> lol
[17:52:12] <JRGould> Hello all, I'm having an issue with trying to cache an element's child as part of that element's data object, run some operations on that child, and then revert to the original child. I've written up an example fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/qtLjS/ any insight would be awesome.
[17:52:31] <henn1nk> does someone know a nice 2 side multiselect plugin, that is maintained? something like this: http://quasipartikel.at/multiselect/
[17:52:34] <systemfault> GPR: What do you think your || does in your selector?
[17:52:37] <ezakimak> iamamoron, and you want the *data about to be POSTed* to be put in the separate iframe, not the result of the POST operation?
[17:53:29] <iamamoron> yes
[17:53:36] <scathen^C> is anyone able to explain the security risks of me allowing users to edit content within the site, to include things like iframes (embedded video)?
[17:53:42] <iamamoron> ezakimak: : yes
[17:54:36] <ezakimak> iamamoron, so, in your <form> do <form onsubmit="return interceptPost(this)"> and function interceptPost(form) { ... collect form fields, display them in iframe .... return true; }
[17:55:07] <ezakimak> scathen^C, content is data--not code
[17:55:24] <ezakimak> shouldn't be a problem--it could only hurt themselves, not yours server.
[17:55:43] <scathen^C> thanks
[17:55:45] <iamamoron> ezakimak: : any google like implementation :D
[17:55:57] <kbanman> scathen^C: google cross-site injection
[17:56:06] <JRGould> scathen^C: they could run js from the iframe that would effect your site
[17:56:23] <ezakimak> only if they can alter what you serve to other people
[17:56:34] <JRGould> scathen^C: not your servers, but the site that other visitors see, so they could redirect their browser, inject ads, popups, etc.
[17:56:56] <scathen^C> right, so how do major content editable sites police things like that? manually?
[17:57:01] <ezakimak> then it could affect what other people see, but by editing content it already does that :)
[17:57:06] <kbanman> they don't allow it
[17:57:12] <JRGould> data sanitization
[17:57:26] <kbanman> Any ideas why calling .focus() on an input element would be ineffective?
[17:57:50] <henn1nk> no ideas?
[17:57:51] <ezakimak> it's distracted?
[17:58:01] <JRGould> kbanman: examples?
[17:58:06] <raisman> guys, what am I missing here http://jsfiddle.net/dD52s/20/ so that the next button hast the next imgs src attrib ? I'm almost there..
[17:58:10] <gvo> kbanman: it's RO?
[17:58:14] <kbanman> RO?
[17:58:20] <gvo> Read only
[17:58:23] <kbanman> nope
[17:58:28] <kbanman> clicking on it works fine
[17:58:44] <kbanman> My example is too complex to put in a fiddle or something
[17:58:49] <ezakimak> are you sure it's inefective? maybe css styling has altered the focus appearance?
[17:59:04] <kbanman> nope, clicking on it manually works
[17:59:21] <ezakimak> is there an onfocus() handler that blurs() it?
[17:59:38] <kbanman> ezakimak: that would also apply to a click, wouldn't it?
[17:59:39] <ezakimak> (counter productive, but...?)
[17:59:40] <gvo> kbanman: show us the $('#xxx').focus() line?
[17:59:55] <ezakimak> hard not to focus on xxx
[17:59:57] <kbanman> it's just straight $('#barcode').focus()
[17:59:57] <GPR> systemfault: Acts as an OR ?
[18:00:08] <JRGould> jsfiddle is your friend!
[18:00:17] <systemfault> GPR: It doesn't work like that..
[18:00:22] <GPR> damn
[18:00:33] <systemfault> GPR: A OR in CSS is the comma character
[18:00:54] <kbanman> it's in a twitter bootstrap modal dialog. Actually nothing in the dialog will focus
[18:00:54] <GPR> so if I replace the || with , it should work?
[18:00:58] <systemfault> GPR:  $('h3, div') will select all h3s and divs
[18:01:14] <GPR> ahhh ok
[18:01:20] <systemfault> GPR: The comma is part of the selector string as you can see in my example
[18:01:27] <JRGould> raisman: your "next" <a> tag is just an open tag
[18:01:54] <ezakimak> kbanman, is it modal?
[18:01:59] <kbanman> it is
[18:02:04] <ezakimak> right. you said.
[18:02:10] <ezakimak> can you make it non-modal?
[18:02:14] <GPR> systemfault: Yep I understand now, thanks for the help :)
[18:02:17] <ezakimak> (just to see if that's somehow affecting it?)
[18:02:30] <ezakimak> could be something to do with how they implement modal
[18:02:47] <systemfault> GPR: You're welcome :)
[18:02:52] <raisman> JRGould: yup, i just want to change the img src attrib inside the a tag to the next picture of the slideshow src attrib
[18:02:52] <JRGould> halp? http://jsfiddle.net/qtLjS/
[18:04:17] <raisman> JRGould: Check it out, I did it :D http://jsfiddle.net/dD52s/21/ only missing thing is that the last image gets kinda "stuck"
[18:07:15] <shoky> yo raj
[18:07:29] <raj> asl?
[18:07:40] <raj> u me pm sexy talk?
[18:07:47] <shoky> 14_flex_pLz
[18:08:10] <raj> 8]
[18:08:10] <shoky> as to your previous question - i was not at all pleased with the ep
[18:08:27] <raj> yeah
[18:08:37] <raj> i like how the black dude turned out to be a complete fraud
[18:09:32] <ryanaz> When did <thead></thead> and <tbody></tbody> become part of the table standard..
[18:09:37] <ryanaz> i guess I missed that memo
[18:09:39] <shoky> nothing happeneed at ALL the whole season. it's still in almost the exact spot it started with
[18:09:40] <ryanaz> is that a jquery thing?
[18:09:48] <ezakimak> nope. just html
[18:10:08] <ryanaz> ezakimak: strange, has that been in there since 96?
[18:10:14] <ryanaz> i've never seen that until now
[18:10:37] <ezakimak> it's been in there a long time, but you don't have to declare them--the browser will insert tbody for you if you don't
[18:10:46] <shoky> oh raj just saw you asked a q
[18:11:23] <ryanaz> ezakimak: i'm seeing that..
[18:11:35] <shoky> raj hmm you can also access nonglobals, no?
[18:11:36] <ryanaz> so if I want to append() into a table, howdo it do it?  it seems to not be working
[18:11:36] <JRGould> raisman: okay, yeah I see what you're trying to do - problem with using next is it doesn't "wrap around"
[18:11:44] <JRGould> next()
[18:12:13] <ezakimak> ryanaz, context?
[18:12:34] <ezakimak> do you mean straight js? or jq
[18:12:38] <ryanaz>         ${'#fuel_admin_table_body').append("<tr><td>one</td><td>two</td><td>three</td></tr>");
[18:13:04] <ezakimak> afaik that should work
[18:13:43] <raisman> JRGould: I'm very new to this, what would you recommend? There's some weird stuff going on when using with the previous button too, small update here: http://jsfiddle.net/dD52s/22/ it would be awesome if you could take a look/help me set this up
[18:15:35] <ezakimak> ryanaz, syntax error ${ <- should be $(  ?
[18:16:27] <ryanaz> ok that's embarrassing ...
[18:16:33] <ryanaz> jeash.
[18:16:39] <ezakimak> check your error console ;)
[18:16:44] <ryanaz> so can I get 40 minutes of my life back??? hah
[18:16:53] <ezakimak> happens to all of us :)
[18:16:59] <ryanaz> yah console. i forget about that
[18:17:11] * ryanaz is a noob
[18:17:25] <ezakimak> no matter, things like that bite everyone at some point
[18:17:44] <rzec> how do I get .offset to return the offset based on the parent element, right now it is doing it based on the window iteself?
[18:17:49] <ryanaz> well I get so fixed on that fact that I don't completely grasp javascript/jquery yet so I just assum I'm doing something wrong
[18:18:02] <ezakimak> and you were :)
[18:18:07] <ryanaz> lol
[18:18:24] <ryanaz> well yah.... lol
[18:19:19] <ezakimak> you just thought you were wrong over here when you were wrong over there... :)
[18:20:28] <JRGould> raisman: I think you'd basically need to write the logic yourself, since it looks like the cycle plugin doesn't assign the 'next' var in the callback the way that you want
[18:20:33] <JRGould> raisman: http://jsfiddle.net/kkAWd/
[18:22:11] <raisman> JRGould: awesome, i see what you did there. console.log isn't necessary right?
[18:22:25] <raisman> thanks for that fiddle :)
[18:22:34] <JRGould> oh no, that's just to see what the problem was
[18:22:49] <JRGould> if you look at that, you'll see that when it wraps the 'caption' variables come up empty
[18:23:07] <scr3am> shoky: FYI, it didn't work at all, this should have looked wayyy different ( html5shiv ) was missing...
[18:23:10] <JRGould> so the solution is to check for that and then if it does replace it with the appropriate end of the array
[18:23:19] <raj> shoky, yes, very weird
[18:23:28] <raj> I could access only globals
[18:23:33] <shoky> scr3am: it seemed same to me, i didnt look too much tho
[18:23:39] <raj> shoky, however, I was redefining one of the variables
[18:23:43] <raj> that seemed to be the issue
[18:24:00] <raisman> JRGould: sounds logical, i'm still reading and trying to understand it while reading it hehe
[18:24:01] <raj> although, the redefinition was after the debugger; statement
[18:24:13] <raj> I changed the variable name and stuff worked
[18:24:40] <shoky> mmm dono what that means without seeing it ;P
[18:25:15] <shoky> also dead tiredd
[18:25:16] <shoky> nitey
[18:26:21] <raj> goodnight bud :)
[18:27:37] <raisman> What does this actually check for ? if(!caption) caption =
[18:31:45] <ezakimak> if caption is undefined, null, or false, it will assign something to it
[18:32:10] <raisman> ok, got it
[18:32:28] <raisman> So it doesn't start empty or with a broken link in my example
[18:32:47] <someprimetime> how can i know when a scrollbar has reached the bottom of a scrollable div?
[18:35:19] <ezakimak> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/303767/how-do-i-determine-height-and-scrolling-po
[18:36:46] <raisman> and something like $('element').parent().children()[0] means the first children of the parent of the element?
[18:37:43] <ezakimak> yes
[18:37:52] <ezakimak> oldest sibling
[18:38:02] <ezakimak> (or self if it's first)
[18:38:09] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, it's something like $("element").scrollTop()==$("element).scrollHeight();
[18:38:37] <Whirl3d> but those may be css properties...basicallly when your scroll top=scroll height you are at the bottom
[18:39:18] <ezakimak> i think you need to calculate $(document).height() - $("element").height() == $("element").scrollTop() ?
[18:40:02] <Whirl3d> ? scrollHeight
[18:40:03] <bot-t> Whirl3d, #7542 (scrollWidth/scrollHeight function)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 7 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7542
[18:40:21] <Whirl3d> ? .scrollHeight()
[18:40:22] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Couldn't find ".scrollHeight()" in jQuery Docs.
[18:43:03] <ezakimak> $(document).height() - $("element").scrollTop() == $("element").height()
[18:43:13] <ezakimak> means you're at the bottom
[18:45:14] <raisman> great, i finally understood wverything on the fiddle example
[18:46:38] <Whirl3d> var atBottom=$(element).height()+$(element).scrollTop()==$(element).prop("scrollHeight)
[18:47:16] <ezakimak> you may need to test that on all browsers
[18:49:09] <Whirl3d> Scrolling is one of those things that it is definitely best to use a plugin like arielFleischer's ScrollTo or Karl Swedberg's smoothScroll
[18:49:38] <ezakimak> good to know
[18:49:59] <ezakimak> bbl8r

[18:53:31] <nebmo> hi, how do I remove the last WORD from a textarea including the space after it is removed? (http://pastebin.com/7ZRkZuYE)
[18:55:05] <Whirl3d> you should probably use regex
[18:57:34] <nebmo> not sure how :(
[18:57:57] <wavez> still trying to get some help on this design issue with jqGrid using gridComplete()
[18:57:58] <wavez> http://jsfiddle.net/wavez/sMzYW/2/
[18:58:18] <wavez> change the sort order and you'll see the number of exclamation marks change to what I'm wanting it to be.
[19:00:00] <Whirl3d> nebmo, try something like this:   var txt=$("textarea").text().replace(/\b\w* ?$/,""); console.log(txt);
[19:01:28] <digs> So, is there a way to attach a class name to an ajax call?+
[19:01:42] <Whirl3d> attach a class to a call?
[19:02:59] <Whirl3d> only if you could smear peanutbutter on a question
[19:05:15] <digs> That is what I thought... just had to be 100% sure.
[19:06:15] <Whirl3d> one is an action and the other is a "thing"....now you can apply a class to an element when the ajax call starts/succeeds/fails...but the class attaches to the element, not the function call
[19:07:04] <digs> That is what I thought. I just wanted to be sure. I knew it was probably a stupid question.
[19:07:17] <digs> I just cannot figure out my issue and wanted to rule that out completely.
[19:07:30] <Whirl3d> why don't you ask about your issue
[19:08:03] <digs> Because it crosses php, drupal, ubercart, custom module and jquery
[19:08:15] <digs> all of those together in a single call.
[19:08:27] <Whirl3d> I see. Sounds like you are a real massochist
[19:08:30] <digs> lol
[19:08:59] <shapr> Hi, I'm trying to debug some jquery code and I've created simple success, error, and complete handlers that just alert. Only the 'complete' handler ever runs. Any idea why that might happen?
[19:09:53] <shapr> Is there some way for a request to be neither error nor success?
[19:09:53] <Whirl3d> shapr, your question lacks enough detail to guess.
[19:10:03] <Whirl3d> timeout
[19:10:11] <Whirl3d> and what kind of request?
[19:10:45] <shapr> It's a $.ajax(call) after explicitly building call with url, data, success, etc
[19:10:59] <Whirl3d> and you may be having problems with your success and error handlers because alert messes up your asynchronous methods. Try using console.log() instead.
[19:11:08] <shapr> I am using console.log
[19:11:18] <Whirl3d> sorry, you said, alert..
[19:11:23] <Whirl3d> that's a diffferent function
[19:11:32] <shapr> Yes, I tried alert as a means of last resort.
[19:11:55] <Whirl3d> what does you ajax statement look like
[19:11:57] <shapr> Here's the code: https://github.com/shapr/ghclive/blob/ajaxhint/prototypes/hintpostexecute/static/haskell.js
[19:12:34] <shapr> This same code works just fine on another website. The only difference I can find is that Firebug shows that other website sending back an Object
[19:12:40] <Whirl3d> shapr, try this:
[19:12:56] <shapr> and I think I'm not sending back an Object, just { key : value } pairs
[19:12:59] <Whirl3d> $.ajax(url, {dataype:json, success:success, etc)
[19:13:21] <shapr> You think the explicit building of call could be the problem?
[19:13:23] <Whirl3d> try pulling the url out of the options and see if it works differently at least
[19:13:33] <shapr> Ok, I'll try that, thanks.
[19:15:17] <shapr> Whirl3d: Thing is, I know it's successfully calling the server, and getting back the response, I can see that in firebug.
[19:16:30] <shapr> I can even see that the response is returning {"expr":"2+3","result":"5"}, which I assume to be correct.
[19:16:34] <Whirl3d> sure, the firs parameter in your object is the url. But the remaining parameters (including the callbacks) are messed up maybe
[19:17:15] <Whirl3d> maybe not, I'm guess here...
[19:17:44] <shapr> The json is parsed correctly by firebug at least.
[19:18:30] <Whirl3d> I see the alternate syntax, your statement should work... try changing success to successfunc...in case it's reserved.
[19:18:36] <shapr> ok
[19:18:38] <wavez> Anyone able to help me with an issue with jqGrid? http://jsfiddle.net/wavez/sMzYW/2/
[19:18:51] <shapr> Whirl3d: And yet, this code works fine on: http://haskell.handcraft.com/
[19:18:57] <Whirl3d> wavez, I have never used it...sorry
[19:19:00] <wavez> I'm trying to have gridComplete() call only once when the data is loaded.
[19:19:12] <shapr> So I don't think success is a reserved word.
[19:19:25] <Whirl3d> longshot?
[19:19:27] <Whirl3d> lol
[19:19:40] <shapr> The only difference I can see is that firebug shows the working page returns an Object, but I don't appear to be returning an Object.
[19:20:13] <Whirl3d> hey, right before you do the ajax call, console.log() your params and see if there is something messed up
[19:20:20] <shapr> Good idea, thanks.
[19:21:58] <Whirl3d> and what about using json, not jsonp...I'm not sure of the difference, but it might have something to do with an expected callback on the return from ajax...
[19:24:05] <shapr> The resulting object looks fine according to console.log :-/
[19:24:30] <Whirl3d> did you try json
[19:25:08] <shapr> Yah, no difference.
[19:25:58] <Whirl3d> Yeah, your gonna have to summon one of the big guys to help...sorry I am out of ideas.
[19:26:10] <shapr> Thanks for the ideas
[19:26:19] <shapr> At least I'm convinced it's not something obvious :-)
[19:27:27] <prefixed> what is the syntax for a function that runs when code loads and assigns a value to a variable?
[19:27:29] <Whirl3d> I would summon s   h  o  k   y if he's available...he's really helpful---I ask for his help all the time so I don't want to call him...lol
[19:28:13] <Whirl3d> prefixed, wat?
[19:28:57] <prefixed> Whirl3d how would I create a method that automatically assigns a value to a variable
[19:29:47] <Whirl3d> (function ($) { var somevar=someval;})(jQuery);
[19:30:16] <prefixed> the variable has to be accessible outside of the function
[19:30:36] <Whirl3d> than var somevar=someval;
[19:30:51] <wavez> Whirl3d, Could you look at the code in my jsfiddle and see if you know a way that a counter could be added to my jqGrid object?
[19:30:52] <Whirl3d> will run befrore the dom is ready and assign the value globally
[19:30:57] <wavez> http://jsfiddle.net/wavez/sMzYW/2/
[19:31:04] <wavez> I'm new to JS
[19:31:16] <prefixed> Whirl3d I need to use a function to determine someval. how do I do that?
[19:31:20] <Whirl3d> wavez, I don't know anything about jqGrid, so don't get your hopes up.
[19:31:42] <Whirl3d> var someval=function () {do stuff}
[19:32:10] <hatoon> hola
[19:32:14] <hatoon> hi
[19:32:28] <Whirl3d> now if that value depends on elements in the dom, you have to do it like: $(document).ready(function () { someVal=function () {dostuff}});
[19:33:13] <Whirl3d> wavez, what are you trying to do now?
[19:34:16] <wavez> Whirl3d, one of the lines at the bottom is adding data to the grid, one row at a time. That causes gridComplete() to run after each row is added. I am wanting to have gridComplete() call only once, after the data is loaded, so that I can use gridComplete() to add jQuery progress bars to my grid.
[19:34:25] <shapr> I got it working! Not exactly sure how either.
[19:34:56] <nebmo> I've managed to get lastIndexOf(" ") working, but now the substring doesnt work (http://jsfiddle.net/P9StL/1/) any ideas please?
[19:35:18] <wavez> Whirl3d, if you change the sort order on the grid, you will see that gridComplete() runs only once, since it destroys all the rows and created the grid anew.
[19:36:09] <Whirl3d> so you used the ! to show that it is being run more than once
[19:36:13] <wavez> yes
[19:36:58] <prefixed> Whirl3d the code you provided simply returns the function
[19:37:53] <Whirl3d> prefixed you have to applyt the function like   var func=function () {doStuff}; var val=func();
[19:38:42] <Whirl3d> or var someval=(function() {doStuff})(50);   perhaps (haven't tried it)
[19:39:26] <Whirl3d> wavez, can you build the grid with opacity=0; then resort it and show it?
[19:39:44] <prefixed> Whirl3d a () at the end works
[19:40:21] <wavez> Whirl3d, I'll look for a method to set the sort order. Hadn't thought of that. Thanks :)
[19:41:15] <Whirl3d> can't you call the gridComplete method when you are done?
[19:41:58] <Whirl3d> something like $("#reports"+i).jsGrid("gridComplete");
[19:54:36] <oojacoboo> hey, if I have a string that I'm passing with ajax as a variable, how can I sanitize it?
[19:54:40] <oojacoboo> is there a method for this?
[19:54:45] <oojacoboo> or would I just use serialize?
[19:56:31] <jasmokee> hello. i'm subscribing to $( document ).resize() and not getting anything when i change the window size. is that to be expected?
[19:57:43] <systemfault> It's $(window).resize
[19:59:56] <jasmokee> systemfault: what exactly is the difference between the window height and the document height?
[20:00:55] <systemfault> jasmokee: What you resize is the window.. and not the document?
[20:01:10] <systemfault> The window represents a "viewport" of your document
[20:01:33] <jasmokee> ooh okay
[20:01:40] <jasmokee> i was thinking about it the other way around
[20:01:47] <systemfault> :)
[20:05:53] <Validatorian> What is the proper syntax for selecting an image that is NOT within a link (even if the link is not the direct parent, in case of <a><span><img/></span></a> for instance)
[20:06:45] <eip56> $('a span img')
[20:06:56] <systemfault> :P
[20:07:02] <systemfault> Have you read the question? :P
[20:07:10] <oojacoboo> Validatorian, there is the :not() "pseudo" selector
[20:07:12] <Validatorian> I think .not('a img') will work
[20:07:25] <oojacoboo> Validatorian, yes
[20:07:56] <Validatorian> is there any significant performance delta between the two options (psudo selector vs .not())
[20:07:59] <oojacoboo> anyone on a quick method for sanitizing a string?
[20:08:15] <oojacoboo> I'm thinking I should just use serialize, but I don't know if that's the right way to go about it
[20:08:35] <systemfault> oojacoboo: sanitize server side, no?
[20:08:58] <oojacoboo> Validatorian, I don't know, but I wouldn't guess either are faster. :not() isn't a real css pseudo selector, so you won't get any of the baked in speed benefits from that
[20:09:12] <oojacoboo> systemfault, server side, no, client side
[20:09:16] <oojacoboo> I'm in #jquery
[20:09:31] <systemfault> oojacoboo: :not() is a real CSS3 selector
[20:09:48] <Validatorian> oojacoboo: I think he's saying, you SHOULD sanitize on the serverside, regardless of any client-side sanitation
[20:09:50] <oojacoboo> I guess it is...
[20:10:01] <oojacoboo> forgot about it :/
[20:10:34] <systemfault> Validatorian: I meant that he shouldn't care that much about sanitizing on the client side because he also has to do it on the server.
[20:10:37] <oojacoboo> Validatorian, ah yea, I would be still passing it in the POST, I'd prefer to sanitize before
[20:10:39] <oojacoboo> as well
[20:11:06] <systemfault> oojacoboo: IIRC, post data is URL encoded
[20:11:15] <systemfault> If send  as "form"
[20:11:18] <systemfault> *sent
[20:11:46] <Validatorian> systemfault: There are still benefits to doing it client-side as well, if it can catch any errors prior to requiring server resources
[20:13:05] <systemfault> Validatorian: You should do validation on the client side to catch user errors.. If the validation passes, it should be fairly safe to pass it to the server..
[20:13:35] <systemfault> Like a said… form data is urlencoded...
[20:13:42] <Validatorian> systemfault: agreed -- just wanted to clarify that using ONLY serverside sanitation isn't always optimal
[20:23:09] <oojacoboo> systemfault, got it, thanks
[20:23:11] <oojacoboo> I wasn't sure
[20:34:17] <oojacoboo> anyone have any experience with live filtered data in js and passing the values of the filter back to php for use?
[20:53:07] <minijupe> how can I create a class and instantiate it in jquery?
[20:53:32] <systemfault> minijupe: ?
[20:54:22] <minijupe> i don't do a lot of js, but used to use prototype: http://www.prototypejs.org/learn/class-inheritance
[20:54:32] <minijupe> systemfault: ^
[20:54:58] <systemfault> You want to create a jQuery plugin?
[20:55:57] <minijupe> systemfault: no, I just want to create a class, and have multiple instances of it. Maybe jquery doesn't abstract this out the way prototype did... and I have to do native js. The horror.
[20:56:17] <systemfault> Ah non, beside .extend, jquery doesn't give you much to deal with classes.
[20:56:30] <systemfault> jQuery is really a DOM abstraction library
[20:57:42] <Cork> and a browser compatibility layer
[20:58:27] <minijupe> systemfault: ok. my project is using jquery, and I'm new to it, but what prototype did for classes was pretty sweet, but it seems to not be used much anymore. could you point me to a reference for how to create classes in JS?
[20:59:03] <systemfault> You should embrace the "prototypal" way :P
[20:59:03] <scathen^C> hey guys im about to ditch aloha editor because it is bloated and bringing me too many bugs. I was going to write my own floating toolbar, just wondering if anyone knows of any toolbar styles I can buy/use/etc?
[20:59:08] <Cork> minijupe: js doesn't have classes, it has contstructors and objects, and prototype
[20:59:17] <systemfault> minijupe: Have you read "Javascript: The good parts"?
[20:59:53] <minijupe> systemfault: parts of it years ago. I usually don't do front end... but I should check back into that...
[21:00:59] <nicovalencia> minijupe: definitely check out the good parts, in the short term look for resources on javascript prototypal inheritance (if you truly want to simulate something like class or object inheritance)
[21:01:57] <minijupe> nicovalencia: this seems to be a level headed description of the issue (http://www.phpied.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/) stop me if I'm wrong.
[21:03:24] <systemfault> minijupe: 1.2 is the classic way, 2 is the prototypal way
[21:04:00] <draginx> Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded <-- why do I get that for $(element).datepicker(); ?
[21:04:34] <Cork> draginx: have you followed it into jquery/jquery-ui and seen what line if fails on?
[21:04:39] <minijupe> systemfault: tnx. you have a recommended way?
[21:04:48] <draginx> Cork: Unfortunately it's not giving me anymore info then that :/
[21:04:58] <systemfault> minijupe: I found 2 to be good enough and more flexible.
[21:05:05] <Cork> draginx: if always gives a line number
[21:05:08] <Cork> and in what file
[21:05:17] <systemfault> minijupe: Some ecosystems prefer the classic way(1.2) like node.js
[21:06:27] <draginx> it literally does not
[21:06:38] <Cork> draginx: do you have a link?
[21:06:46] <draginx> not a public one hold on :)
[21:07:23] <draginx> http://i.imgur.com/Wr26M.png
[21:07:26] <draginx> thats all it says literally
[21:07:29] <Cork> sigh
[21:07:29] <draginx> no number line on the right
[21:07:35] <Cork> i can't debug an image
[21:10:04] <minijupe> systemfault: it looks like method 2 is a singleton and can't actually be instantiated to have other similar objects with different properties....
[21:10:29] <systemfault> minijupe: You create a function that returns such an object
[21:11:40] <systemfault> ?eval function apple(color) { var foo = color   'red'; return { color: color };  }  apple();
[21:11:42] <bot-t> systemfault: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[21:11:42] <systemfault> Err
[21:12:02] <Cork> heh
[21:12:19] <systemfault> ?eval function apple(color) { var foo = color  || 'red'; return { color: foo };  }  [apple(), apple('blue')];
[21:12:20] <bot-t> systemfault: [{"color": "red"}, {"color": "blue"}]
[21:12:29] <systemfault> minijupe: ^^
[21:12:32] <jiggz> Hi, i have a <button> inside a form to check a validation. But if i click the <button> it submits the form.. if I add e.preventDefault(); then if i enter the field and press 'enter' on the keyboard to submit the form, it actually triggers the button 'click' event...
[21:13:00] <Cork> jiggz: that is expected
[21:13:15] <systemfault> jiggz: Don't listen on the click event, listen on the form element for the submit event
[21:13:15] <aamax> hi all I'm very new to javascript and Jquery - marginally new to rails (which is what i'm working in right now).  I have a couple partials and based on the value in a select box, I want to display a partial in an area on my form (using ajax I think).   how can I do that?
[21:13:30] <Cork> jiggz:  buttons and input type="submit" gets special actions in forms
[21:14:07] <Cork> ?.load @ aamax
[21:14:08] <bot-t> aamax, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[21:14:14] <Cork> uh
[21:14:33] <jiggz> Cork: i'm suprised <button> is tied to submitting a form.. do you know how i can have a button in a form that won't submit?
[21:14:36] <Cork> aamax: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[21:14:37] <aamax> thx.  I'll check that out.
[21:15:07] <Cork> jiggz: nope, its old old OLD legacy behavior
[21:15:34] <Cork> you can have the button outside the form and it should work fine
[21:15:51] <jiggz> Cork: not possible.. i guess i'll style an anchor to look like a button
[21:16:01] <jiggz> thanks
[21:16:13] <Cork> jiggz: if its not a link, use a span instead
[21:16:24] <Cork> links should always have url targets
[21:18:26] <systemfault> jiggz: <button type="button"> shoudl work
[21:18:28] <minijupe> systemfault: what would be the equivalent of a class method in a javascript class?
[21:18:49] <Cork> systemfault: it will still hook into the forms submit stream
[21:18:49] <systemfault> minijupe: An object method
[21:19:51] <systemfault> ?eval function apple() { var color = 'red'; return { getColor: function() { return color; } };  } var x = apple(); x.getcolor();
[21:19:52] <bot-t> systemfault: TypeError: x.getcolor is not a function
[21:19:55] <systemfault> Ffuuu
[21:20:06] <minijupe> systemfault: I don't know why I wrote that, I meant to write class variable (as opposed to an instance variable)
[21:20:09] <systemfault> ?eval function apple() { var color = 'red'; return { getColor: function() { return color; } };  } var x = apple(); x.getColor();
[21:20:10] <bot-t> systemfault: "red"
[21:20:24] <systemfault> Ah
[21:21:06] <Cork> you can do that either through scoping or prototype
[21:21:35] <systemfault> ?eval function apple© { var color = c || 'red'; return { getColor: function() { return color; } };  } apple.createBlue = function() { return apple('blue'); }; apple.createBlue();

[21:43:45] <oojacoboo> only way for me to get them is through a loop, so I figured I needed to push() them into the data array
[21:43:53] <nicovalencia> da-beginner: you need to have a valid endpoint that returns a correctly formatted response
[21:43:56] <nicovalencia> http://jsfiddle.net/xRnQ3/
[21:44:07] <nicovalencia> there's an example ^
[21:44:30] <tw2113> "Calling .data() with no parameters retrieves all of the values as a JavaScript object."
[21:44:55] <oojacoboo> tw2113, yea, but it instantiates that object as well, no?
[21:45:06] <oojacoboo> set to the var I defined
[21:45:07] <tw2113> not that i'm aware of, but i can't claim js pro
[21:45:08] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: you didnt make any changes?
[21:45:40] <tw2113> i'm just reading the docs on the function
[21:45:52] <nicovalencia> my apologies http://jsfiddle.net/xRnQ3/2/
[21:46:02] <oojacoboo> tw2113, http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[21:46:11] <oojacoboo> the example in there lead me to think so
[21:46:36] <berndj> a selector to get hold of <input name="new_images[]" /> ? anything less hackish than $('input[name^=new_images]')?
[21:46:42] <tw2113> based on that example, calling it without a key, would pull int all the data-* attributes into a js object
[21:46:58] <oojacoboo> tw2113, correct, but if there aren't any?
[21:47:02] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: so how do i create a file that can mimic photos_public.gne in my local drive?
[21:47:08] <snover> berndj: ummm. input[name="new_images[]"]
[21:47:15] <tw2113> not sure what would happen with zero of them
[21:47:35] <berndj> quotes. that's the one i didn't think of. thanks!
[21:47:52] <nicovalencia> da-beginner: you need to create an endpoint on your server that responds with json
[21:49:02] <oojacoboo> tw2113, maybe it'd be better to just create a var set as an array, loop and push to array, then set the data with the array value?
[21:49:15] <tw2113> that'd likely work
[21:50:33] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: is there a way to serve an .xml or .json file instead? from my local?
[21:51:16] <nicovalencia> .json, certainly
[21:55:41] <RobertV> which API allows me to change the 'this' value of the called function?
[21:55:49] <oojacoboo> tw2113, did the trick, thanks for being a sounding board
[21:55:52] <oojacoboo> :)
[21:55:56] <tw2113> ;)
[21:56:27] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: what if the url returns html?
[21:56:35] <da-beginner> and from another browser?
[21:56:40] <nicovalencia> RobertV: check out call, apply and bind (<careful with browser support)
[21:56:42] <da-beginner> can i still use getJSON?
[21:56:52] <da-beginner> or get? but get doesn't allow cross domain
[21:57:18] <RobertV> okay, thanks
[21:58:46] <nicovalencia> da-beginner: jsonp requrests return javascript
[22:01:09] <aamax> thanks for the tips.. gonna come back to this in the morning.  l8rs
[22:02:41] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: what do you mean return javascript?
[22:03:45] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: http://jsfiddle.net/xRnQ3/4/
[22:04:19] <da-beginner> all i want to do is to use jsonp to give me a json file
[22:05:31] <systemfault> da-beginner: The server returns javascript when you use JSONP and not JSON
[22:05:46] <systemfault> JSONP is an ugly and disgusting hack.
[22:06:04] <da-beginner> systemfault: yes i know but i have to use it
[22:06:17] <da-beginner> because it is cross-domain
[22:06:34] <nicovalencia> well you don't HAVE to
[22:06:35] <RobertV> nicovalencia, not sure how to use 'call' for my issue: function outer { $.get(..., function(){ /* i need 'this' == outer.this */ } }     // would it be something like $.get.call(this, ...) ?
[22:07:11] <systemfault> Just assign "this" to a variable in the outer scope..
[22:07:21] <RobertV> okay
[22:07:33] <systemfault>  function outer { var that = this; $.get(..., function(){ that.lol();} }
[22:07:46] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: what do you mean?
[22:08:34] <nicovalencia> check out cors
[22:08:54] <nicovalencia> why do you need to be retrieving json from another domain?
[22:08:56] <systemfault> CORS is not well supported on crap browsers
[22:09:00] <RobertV> thanks
[22:09:03] <nicovalencia> ^ indeed
[22:11:04] <da-beginner> systemfault: yes i think CORS have limitations
[22:11:24] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: i'm just a corporate slave
[22:14:24] <da-beginner> nicovalencia systemfault : when you say jsonp returns javascript, how do i parse my result so that it is javascript?
[22:15:39] <nicovalencia> jsonp's goal is to return data (as an object) - the raw data object won't parse when loaded via <script> tag, so it is wrapped in a callback function
[22:16:12] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: http://jsfiddle.net/xRnQ3/5/
[22:16:23] <da-beginner> the js is the test.js
[22:16:41] <da-beginner> it does return the object, but for some reason it wont run because it says parseError
[22:17:23] <nicovalencia> http://fiddle.jshell.net/xRnQ3/5/show/test.js?
[22:17:39] <nicovalencia> that doesn't return an object for me
[22:19:15] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: http://jsfiddle.net/xRnQ3/6/
[22:19:19] <da-beginner> it returns the object in xhr
[22:26:51] <nicovalencia> da-beginner: yes, that's in the error handler though... since the resource you are referencing doesn't respond
[22:27:07] <nicovalencia> It's the 404 response
[22:27:31] <oojacoboo> what's the best way to url encode a data store array?
[22:27:55] <oojacoboo> I'm not using $.ajax so I can't let it handle that
[22:28:55] <oojacoboo> and I don't think that's an array, but rather a string
[22:30:09] <da-beginner> nicovalencia: i've got status 200
[22:30:11] <da-beginner> response 4
[22:30:19] <da-beginner> readyState=4
[22:30:34] <da-beginner> and responseText=	"function myCallback(){ console.log('Hello'); alert('Hey'); } "
[22:30:44] <da-beginner> but why doesn't it call success?
[22:34:44] <systemfault> Because JSONP doesn't work like that..
[22:36:10] <systemfault> While the ajax transaction was successful… The "JSONP" part of the transaction failed.
[22:37:22] <shennyg> I'm looking for .push but for an object. how do I do that?
[22:37:55] <shennyg> currently I'm using .extend but I'm doing it a few times and the keys are overwriting eachother.
[22:38:13] <Cork> shennyg: objects dosn't have push
[22:38:25] <shennyg> so I should convert it to an array...
[22:38:39] <Cork> if you want to have multible existance of the same info yes
[22:38:47] <Cork> make an array of objects
[22:39:21] <Cork> [{info:val},{info:val},{info:val}]
[22:39:30] <shennyg> got it. thanks Cork
[22:39:38] <Blaster> hey is there a way to insert an element right before the closing body tag?
[22:39:44] <Cork> a key will be overwritten if you set it twice
[22:39:58] <Cork> bla: append?
[22:40:11] <Cork> ?.append
[22:40:11] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[22:41:20] <Blaster> cool
[22:42:54] <oojacoboo> does anyone have any clues on serializing/url encoding a data() array for prepending to an url?
[22:43:26] <Cork> oojacoboo: you means params? see ?.params
[22:43:36] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".params" in jQuery Docs.
[22:43:44] <Cork> uh...
[22:43:54] <oojacoboo> Cork, singular, one parameter to pass with a url
[22:43:55] <Cork> ?jquery.params
[22:43:56] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery.param() - Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[22:44:04] <oojacoboo> Cork, I tried that
[22:44:14] <oojacoboo> I got undefined for all the values in the array
[22:44:35] <Cork> your trying to serialize the content of an array, and nothing else?
[22:44:45] <oojacoboo> it's from a data store
[22:44:48] <prefixed> so
[22:44:51] <oojacoboo> so it's technically an object I guess
[22:44:56] <Inv1s1ble> If I put an event on a button, is there a way to get the form element (parent) that button belongs to?
[22:45:01] <prefixed> how big is "too big" as far as jquery files are concerned?
[22:45:04] <Cork> oojacoboo: params (as in url params) can't handle that
[22:45:13] <oojacoboo> :/
[22:45:15] <Cork> oojacoboo: you need an object name for the array
[22:45:18] <systemfault> Inv1s1ble: use .closest('form')
[22:45:24] <Cork> { my_array: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9] }
[22:45:39] <Cork> ?eval $.params({ my_array: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9] })
[22:45:40] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: $.params is not a function
[22:45:53] <Cork> :/
[22:45:59] <oojacoboo> ?eval $.param({ my_array: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9] })
[22:46:00] <bot-t> oojacoboo: "my_array%5B%5D=1&my_array%5B%5D=2&my_array%5B%5D=3&my_array%5B%5D=4&my_array%5B%5D=5&my_array%5B%5D=6&my_array%5B%5D=7&my_array%5B%5D=8&my_array%5B%5...
[22:46:14] <Cork> ah
[22:46:14] <systemfault> What an ugly string :D
[22:46:19] <Cork> yup
[22:46:25] <Cork> but thats params for you
[22:46:46] <Cork> ?eval $.param({ my_array: JSON.serialize([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9]) })
[22:46:47] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: JSON.serialize is not a function
[22:46:54] <Cork> ?eval $.param({ my_array: JSON.stringify([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9]) })
[22:46:55] <bot-t> Cork: "my_array=%5B1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7%2C8%2C8%2C9%5D"
[22:47:09] <oojacoboo> I see
[22:47:38] <systemfault> Anyway… send data with GET is a sin that should be punishable by execution
[22:47:46] <Cork> heh true
[22:47:53] <Cork> get isn't garanteed to get to the server
[22:48:10] <Cork> though if it doesn't actually update anything its fine
[22:48:17] <Cork> (ex. a selection string)
[22:48:28] <systemfault> True
[22:48:30] <oojacoboo> it's for downloading a file
[22:48:50] <systemfault> It's okay then
[22:49:32] <Inv1s1ble> I'm dynamically adding events to a bunch of delete buttons on a list. I want to display a confirmation dialog. I've attached events to the Delete, but I'm not sure how to go about finding the parent form and submitting it: http://pastebin.com/Wn3cuFkJ
[22:49:34] <oojacoboo> I'm still not quite certain on making the array an object
[22:49:56] <oojacoboo> do I just manually form that or is the a method for creating that object?
[22:50:08] <oojacoboo> or is that a multi-dimensional array, I can't even tell :/
[22:50:29] <Cork> oojacoboo: you don't have to
[22:50:49] <Cork> oojacoboo:  { key_name: my_array_variable }
[22:51:05] <Cork> but you need to give your param holding the array a name
[22:51:05] <Inv1s1ble> anyhelp?
[22:51:07] <Cork> thats all
[22:51:37] <oojacoboo> Cork, I've already defined the parameter name in the url
[22:51:40] <Inv1s1ble> I was thinking of "$(this).parents("form")", but how do I pass the button or form to the dialog widget
[22:51:47] <oojacoboo> I'm guessing js needs it to do the serialization?
[22:51:50] <Cork> Inv1s1ble: 1. you don't need the each loop
[22:51:53] <oojacoboo> the jquery method that is...
[22:52:04] <Cork> Inv1s1ble: 2. use a delegated event listner instead of attaching one to each element
[22:52:25] <Cork> Inv1s1ble: $('input[value="Delete"]').click will do the same as your doing, but with less code
[22:53:16] <Cork> Inv1s1ble: $(some_parent).on('click', 'input[value="Delete"]', function() {}) will do similar to what your doing, but more efficient
[22:53:45] <shennyg> I'm looking at this in my browser's console: https://img.skitch.com/20120607-dpn4adh8tjph34q6hbrhf7s8w3.jpg If "item" is the Object shouldn't item.name give me "STAPLES Center"?
[22:54:14] <systemfault> shennyg: Yes sir
[22:54:23] <shennyg> I'm getting undefined....
[22:54:24] <oojacoboo> var filteredIds = $.param({'filtered-ids': JSON.stringify($("table.rent-roll#pager-table").data("filteredIds"))});
[22:54:26] <oojacoboo> that's just nasty
[22:54:30] <Inv1s1ble> Corey, okay, got rid of the loop, but how do I reference the form to do a .submit() from inside the dialog?
[22:54:38] <Cork> Inv1s1ble: about getting the form you should use closest, not parents
[22:54:53] <Cork> $(this).closest('form').submit();
[22:55:16] <Cork> or do you mean from the yes button?
[22:55:26] <Inv1s1ble> the yes button
[22:55:41] <Inv1s1ble> I'd have to pass the form to the dialog wouldn't it? It has no reference to the button
[22:55:48] <Cork> Inv1s1ble: run var $form = $(this).closest('form'); before the .dialog line
[22:56:09] <Cork> this will change meaning in the dialog callbacks
[22:57:53] <shennyg> I think I'm building it wrong... https://gist.github.com/c2073cace088f2319905
[22:58:36] <shennyg> I'm taking a sub-object and doing .each on it. and then doing .makeArray
[22:58:44] <shennyg> I'm sure there is a better way to do this.
[22:59:14] <Inv1s1ble> Cork, Thanks!
[22:59:16] <Cork> shennyg: whats item.doclist.docs?
[22:59:28] <Cork> or rather whats item
[23:00:22] <Cork> shennyg: btw, i would be carefull about reusing the variable name item like that
[23:00:31] <shennyg> yeah I just noticed that.
[23:00:42] <shennyg> the original item is an object.
[23:00:52] <Cork> and the last one?
[23:00:58] <Cork> *later*
[23:01:49] <Cork> shennyg: what about var allDocs = $.map(item.doclist.docs, function(doc) { return $.makeArray(doc); }); ?
[23:02:34] <shennyg> then I can start with a array and not worry about doing it later. thanks I'll try that.l
[23:03:21] <rodd> could anyone point me what im missing here? http://jsfiddle.net/zzzrod/Qbmjw/3/
[23:05:19] <systemfault> rodd: For some reason I don't yet understand… if you remove the parseJSON… it works
[23:06:27] <Cork> jquery .data parses json by default
[23:06:39] <Cork> no need to dubble parse it :)
[23:06:52] <rodd> Cork didnt know that, thanks
[23:06:55] <rodd> thanks systemfault
[23:07:15] <systemfault> When the data attribute is an object (starts with '{') or array (starts with '[') then jQuery.parseJSON is used to parse the string; it must follow valid JSON syntax including quoted property names.
[23:07:17] <systemfault> wtf...
[23:07:42] <systemfault> I hate functions that does too much..
[23:08:17] <Cork> systemfault: you can always use attr
[23:08:34] <Cork> data is meant to handle the data- prefix as much like objects as possible
[23:08:47] <systemfault> Cork: I see
[23:11:26] <shennyg> Cork: is there a place I can paste json that will be formatted nicely (and share it via a url like a pastie)
[23:11:47] <oojacoboo> jsfiddle.net
[23:11:48] <Cork> prob
[23:11:56] <Cork> oojacoboo: it doens't format it though
[23:12:11] <oojacoboo> well, a little tabbing never hurt anyone
[23:12:38] <shennyg> that works :).
[23:13:01] <shennyg> I need to turn http://jsfiddle.net/9DEFy/ into this http://jsfiddle.net/RqjUU/
[23:13:13] <shennyg> I need to get rid of the grouping.
[23:13:24] <shennyg> and merge together the three facets into one.
[23:16:16] <oojacoboo> shennyg, I haven't looked at it, but decode it, loop over it and rebuild
[23:16:17] <shennyg> There are three groups, event/performer/venue, and I need to take the docs section of each and merge them into one.
[23:19:49] <shennyg> oojacoboo: I tried but I'm putting objects into arrays.
[23:19:53] <shennyg> I think I'm close: http://jsfiddle.net/VzPNJ/
[23:19:59] <shennyg> you will need to open up the console.
[23:22:29] <oojacoboo> shennyg, I'd look man, but trying to wrap this up and get out of the office and home to bed, I've got an early meeting in the AM
[23:22:35] <oojacoboo> sorry
[23:22:52] <shennyg> no worries oojacoboo, thanks for the pointers :)
[23:26:31] <raj> if I attach .data() to an element, and then append it somewhere, does it lose its .data()?
[23:26:48] <Whirl3d> its' not supposed to
[23:27:29] <Cork> raj: no, only if you clone it
[23:27:32] <Cork> ?.clone
[23:27:33] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[23:27:43] <Cork> withDataAndEvents <--
[23:28:04] <Whirl3d> when making a plugin extendable, how do you anchor new methods to the plugin. I thought that some sort of event/subscriber system would work, allowing you to listen to events and receive callbacks accordingly.
[23:28:40] <raj> ok, must be something else then
[23:28:52] <raj> cuz I'm not cloning
[23:29:02] <raj> ...k, investigating further
[23:29:07] <Cork> Whirl3d: if your using a framework to create your plugin it might have built in ways to keep track of them
[23:29:30] <Cork> Whirl3d: if your writing plain jquery plugins, you might have to do that your self
[23:29:41] <Whirl3d> Naw, I am building my own framework. LOL
[23:30:14] <Cork> events will keep working for other plugins too as long as you don't user return false in your handlers
[23:34:45] <Whirl3d> I figured I would make a global object that managed all event registrations, subscriptions, and publications. items that wanted to be listenable would "register" their event with the director object, items that wanted to listen to those events would subscribe to those events and then when the event happens, the registered publisher, announces the event and the director performs the callbacks
[23:34:45] <Whirl3d> for the subscribers...
[23:34:46] <Whirl3d> pfew
[23:35:46] <raj> ok, so this is my code, and line 13 is turning out an empty object for each iteration http://paste.ofcode.org/dKibVtzhUAkGUXjYKjTvHc
[23:40:45] <Whirl3d> raj, I see you in here all the time. Why on earth would you post something like that on a service that you can't provide a running and applicable example? I mean, it's not like you are unfamiliar with the constant requests to use jsfiddle...yet you would rather post inanimate code than a (not) working example? I don't get it.
[23:41:57] <Whirl3d> without being able to log parts of that code to see what's going where, I can't help...
[23:42:17] <raj> cuz it was short enough that it would be a theoretical answer, as opposed to working through some kink
[23:42:35] <Whirl3d> but it's abstracted
[23:42:57] <Whirl3d> you need to be able to console.log($li_temp) and each of those pieces until you find the one that isn't showing up right
[23:44:59] <Whirl3d> what if you took $select_tmp and detached it
[23:45:11] <Whirl3d> in line 4
[23:46:47] <raj> what's detaching mean?
[23:47:29] <Whirl3d> remove it from the dom, but keep it in a variable reference
[23:47:36] <Whirl3d> so you can later append it
[23:48:05] <Whirl3d> It's almost like you lose the reference to it when you rewrite the html for it's parent element
[23:48:20] <Whirl3d> on line 11
[23:48:57] <raj> hmm, good thinking
[23:49:08] <Whirl3d> I can't log the pieces to be sure if that happens, but if it does, then detatching it might remove it from the parent before you overwrite it in line 11. Making it possible to append it.
[23:49:52] <Whirl3d> But that's not supposed to work like that. you can have a jquery object refer to an element that is deleted and still append it back to the dom without detaching it...so I am not sure what's happening there.
[23:50:23] <gkunno> Hello all! How could i make the jQuery function (see fiddle) only flip back the element that is clicked after the delay, and not remove the class from all the elements at the same time. Ill guess the soluiton would be .parent but i lack the skills for this :) full example in: http://jsfiddle.net/mDuuZ/ thnx in adcanve
[23:50:43] <Whirl3d> and perhaps you could modify it only after you append it---in other words, once you append it, do liines 7-10
[23:51:15] <raj> Whirl3d, you were right
[23:51:25] <raj> it was .html() on the parent that killed it
[23:51:39] <raj> I instead did var $select_temp = $li_temp.find('select').clone()
[23:53:23] <Whirl3d> gkunno, try return false in your click handler?
[23:54:23] <Whirl3d> gkunno, what do you want the cards to do
[23:55:30] <gkunno> Whirl3d its just i card that shows info about the person, and when you click it you see a picture of the person, it is working right now, but the problem is that i dont want (i have like 12 cards) to flip back at the same time efter the delay
[23:56:22] <gkunno> i am trying to get each card flip after the delay, so that if you open multiple cards they flip back each after the specified delay
