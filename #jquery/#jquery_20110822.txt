[00:01:40] <bananasontoast> You're missing an opening brace
[00:02:15] <juha_> dr0id: man i love your examples <3
[00:02:27] <Fredcpp> really? :S where? :S
[00:02:30] <Jarred> So I'm having some trouble getting Rails to receive the data sent via jQuery's .ajax function
[00:02:31] <Jarred> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7144082/receiving-parameters-but-not-updating-attributes-of-model
[00:02:37] <dr0id> ;)
[00:03:23] <dr0id> Fredcpp: I think this. fails
[00:03:46] <cam_> good bye friends!!!
[00:04:01] <dr0id> try $("a.ajaxified").attr('href'), and if that works store a.ajaxified in a var
[00:04:11] <Fredcpp> ok, trying now
[00:04:13] <Fredcpp> ty
[00:05:58] <Jarred> Any help?
[00:09:07] <siovene> l/close
[00:09:10] <siovene> Sorry.
[00:12:51] <mercury_> why XMLHttpRequest works normal, and $.ajax doesnt ($.ajax it multiplays the request to remote file) ??
[00:14:19] <ShaunO``> what do you mean by multiplay
[00:14:23] <ShaunO``> the request
[00:17:08] <mercury_> if i pust the alert() in ajaxComplete i get alert the times i clicked the button
[00:17:32] <mercury_> first time is ok (clicked once), evry other isnt
[00:18:27] <ShaunO``> depends how you've implemented your XMLHttpRequest, $.ajax is asynchronous and every call to it is a new request but i think if you implemented your XMLHttpRequest in a certain way, it will not perform a new request untilt he first is complete
[00:19:43] <ShaunO``> so it's up to you to make the check whether it should perform another request or not
[00:21:21] <ndss56> does jquery have function to sanitise text from input fields?
[00:21:33] <M4st3rM134> Hi there. I'm using jquery on my Homepage but it has to load a file of ~ 0,25 mb. I read about to use a compressed version. How to get it ?
[00:25:18] <M4st3rM134> :(
[00:26:01] <Fredcpp> I'm giving up on this.
[00:26:06] <Fredcpp> Thnks guys
[00:26:41] <Fredcpp> btw this didn't work ( maybe I'm still too noob on It):
[00:26:42] <Fredcpp> $(document).ready(function()
[00:26:42] <Fredcpp> {
[00:26:42] <Fredcpp> 	var link = $('#a.ajaxified').attr('href');
[00:26:42] <Fredcpp> 	$('#a.ajaxified').load(link+' #h1_title');
[00:26:42] <Fredcpp> });
[00:29:13] <Fredcpp> bye and thanks again
[00:30:08] <huglester> Fredcpp: does the doc.ready work if you put alert('test'); ?
[00:57:09] <caaakeeey> any ideas why this isnt working, the jquery isnt chnagingthe css, but if i set that property in the .css sheet it changes, so i know the class exists at least http://dpaste.com/600291/
[01:02:05] <Cork> caaakeeey: use ready see ?.ready
[01:02:05] <bot-t> caaakeeey, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[01:08:10] <caaakeeey> http://dpaste.com/600297/ <-- no luck :/, d i need to set some kind of time out to make sure it runs after syntax highlighter?
[01:08:50] <xjjk> hello, in Python you can 'multiply a list" , e.g. [2]*4 generates [2,2,2,2]
[01:08:58] <xjjk> is there equivalent w/ jQuery?
[01:09:44] <Cork> xjjk: closest is $.map
[01:10:33] <xec> caaakeeey: i don't see any element with class name "keyword"?
[01:12:22] <murrrley> Hi! Anyone else ran into problems with using the get() method with pages that includes js functions? I'm using it to load pages into a certain div on my page, and it apart from one page it works fine. The one page just jumps into a blank page with the output of the js function and nothing else. The said page works fine when accessed normally, though.
[01:14:11] <caaakeeey> xec: syntax highlighter sets some classes, if got it working now anyway, thanks
[01:16:26] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. If I have a div with id='blue_pg' which requires a function to be run called 'blue_func'. This is true for every page of id='something'_pg (needs to run something_func) how can I do that?
[01:17:42] <Cork> Whirl3d: using id's will be hard, your better of using classes
[01:17:50] <Cork> *using a class
[01:18:05] <Whirl3d> all of the pages have the same class
[01:18:18] <Whirl3d> I need to call a function based on a string literal
[01:18:32] <Whirl3d> like call("some_func")
[01:19:33] <caaakeeey> im slightly confused though - why does http://dpaste.com/600300/ work, but not if i remove the (apparently redundant) timeout
[01:20:38] <Whirl3d> See, basically before the pageDiv is displayed, it needs to be initialized. Each pageDiv has it's own initialization function.
[01:21:10] <Whirl3d> So I thought I could scope the init function and in my showPageDiv function simply do newPageDiv.init();
[01:21:57] <MrSamuel> Hi… When making jQuery plugin, what is the best way to provide extra functionality?
[01:22:09] <MrSamuel> I noticed that some people use a string argument as the first parameter to change the behaviour
[01:22:10] <MrSamuel> e.g.
[01:22:25] <MrSamuel> $('foobar').myPlugin('setup', …)
[01:22:36] <Whirl3d> aha! I just figured it out. I can use newPage.each(funciton() {var func=$(this).data("init"); func();});
[01:22:40] <Whirl3d> nvm, thx
[01:22:41] <MrSamuel> Is this a good way to do it or is there some other better way to do it?
[01:22:46] <MoTiOnXml> MrSamuel: ?google ajpiano widget factory
[01:22:46] <MrSamuel> Thanks ^_^
[01:24:07] <MrSamuel> MoTiOnXml: cool thanks that looks interesting

[01:29:58] <patac> anyone can help me
[01:29:59] <jonee> K1ng``, looks like this is what you need http://stackoverflow.com/questions/446594/kill-ajax-requests-using-javascript-using-jquery
[01:30:00] <MoTiOnXml> MrSamuel: i think a good advice would be reading the docs on jquery.com, browse the selectors, operators etc. on the jQuery object
[01:30:06] <patac> yes
[01:30:11] <MrSamuel> sure, I'm just lazy
[01:30:19] <MrSamuel> I want to be spoon fed like a baby :p
[01:30:21] <patac> i cna get normal json vlaues but not array
[01:30:27] <K1ng``> patac, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON
[01:30:27] <MoTiOnXml> MrSamuel: don't come here asking for other peoples help just because you're lazy
[01:30:32] <MoTiOnXml> MrSamuel: that's pathetic
[01:30:39] <MrSamuel> MoTiOnXml: that was a joke man

[01:32:29] <K1ng``> jonee, thanks but how i am gonna use it on .load()?
[01:32:32] <aaronmcadam> hmm maybe you're right MrSamuel
[01:32:44] <patac> im having a hard time getting the values of the array
[01:32:59] <aaronmcadam> you probably need to parse the JSON first if you're not already
[01:33:25] <K1ng``> patac, paste your code on www.jsfiddle.net
[01:33:28] <aaronmcadam> $.parseJSON( '{ "key" : "value" }' );

[01:33:41] <purefusion2> I'm trying to do a modal dialog popup with jquery UI but when I call $("#contact").dialog(); I get "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dialog'"
[01:33:53] <qqumpkin> i have a pretty short script that after 10 minutes is eating a gig of ram in chrome, really not sure why, the script is very short and everything seems to be running fine, wondering if their is some dom gotcha i am noobing up http://www.design4kicks.co.nz/v3/js/slideshow.js
[01:33:58] <purefusion2> any ideas how to debug that?
[01:34:03] <aaronmcadam> purefusion: looks like ui isn't being loaded
[01:34:27] <aaronmcadam> check source order
[01:34:36] <purefusion2> aaronmcadam: how can I verify if it is loaded or not?
[01:34:51] <aaronmcadam> typeof $.dialog
[01:34:52] <Cork> purefusion2: have you loaded jquery-ui and made sure you've waited for ready?
[01:34:58] <aaronmcadam> or else just look at your actual html
[01:35:05] <mr_lou> Hello. Can someone tell me what style to set on an element in order to hide it before it's even show - and be compatible with all the .hide() and .slideToggle() methods?
[01:35:36] <Cork> mr_lou: you can't set any style to be compatible
[01:35:50] <Cork> mr_lou: when .hide() is run, it saves the original display value
[01:36:12] <aaronmcadam> olddisplay
[01:36:26] <purefusion2> aaronmcadam, Cork: yep, jquery is being called before jquery-ui in the source, and I am using $(function() { ... }); to run the script
[01:36:31] <aaronmcadam> if you examine the element with fireQuery you'll see
[01:36:36] <mr_lou> Cork: Bummer. So there's no way an element can loaded hidden? It has to be shown first, and then hidden afterwards in order to be jQuery compatible?
[01:36:49] <mr_lou> Right
[01:37:02] <patac> $.parseJSON( '{ "key" : "value" }' ) = normal but how about $.parseJSON([{"key":"value1"},"key":"value2"}])=an array
[01:37:23] <Cork> mr_lou: var $pre = $('org'); $pre.hide(); $parent.append($pre);
[01:37:40] <aaronmcadam> yeah patac
[01:37:43] <aaronmcadam> what's the problem?
[01:37:48] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ patac

[01:37:58] <patac> how can i get the value of ana rray
[01:38:17] <mr_lou> Cork: Ah, of course. Thanks. Will look into that. Thanks.
[01:38:19] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[01:38:27] <aaronmcadam> you mean you want to loop over it right
[01:39:04] <patac> yes
[01:39:08] <patac> how cna io loop

[01:39:17] <aaronmcadam> ?$.each @ patac
[01:39:18] <bot-t> patac, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[01:39:26] <aaronmcadam> or a for loop?
[01:39:37] <patac> ok ill try
[01:39:38] <aaronmcadam> you really dunno how to loop over an array?
[01:39:42] <juria_roberts> heyy i cannot get the jquery button to show
[01:39:49] <juria_roberts> it shows a normal html button
[01:40:13] <juria_roberts> i dont know what needs to be done
[01:40:53] <patac> heres the code
[01:40:54] <patac> http://fixee.org/paste/1irk18x/
[01:40:59] <aaronmcadam> what are you talking about "jquery button" juria_roberts
[01:41:37] <patac> i just wanted to get all vehicle codes and its description
[01:41:40] <juria_roberts> aaronmcadam: im talking abt this http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/
[01:41:57] <caaakeeey> silly question - but whats the best way of having multiple elements with very similar javascript, and the only difference is selecting something different based on its id - do i make them all the same class, and select the id, or what?
[01:42:22] <aaronmcadam> yeah caaakeeey
[01:42:25] <aaronmcadam> give them ids
[01:42:27] <aaronmcadam> and a class
[01:42:33] <aaronmcadam> and use the class to select em
[01:42:51] <purefusion2> aaronmcadam, Cork: aha... I found a second script tag for jquery after the first two are called. I suppose that would render jquery-ui ineffective, eh?
[01:43:00] <caaakeeey> alright ill give that a go
[01:43:06] <aaronmcadam> then do somethin like $( '.group' ).click( function() { this.id ... } );
[01:43:22] <aaronmcadam> yep
[01:43:37] <patac> aaronmcadam can you please check my code http://fixee.org/paste/1irk18x/
[01:44:19] <aaronmcadam> patac, do you know what a for loop is?
[01:44:32] <aaronmcadam> you really don't know how to iterate over an array?
[01:44:56] <patac> i dont know how to do it in javascript
[01:45:14] <aaronmcadam> it's the same as most others
[01:45:16] <juria_roberts> do I have to use themeroller to get the button styles to show?
[01:45:36] <patac> for i=o;i<value.length,i++{}

[01:50:23] <patac> @aaronmcadam ok ill check
[01:50:40] <caaakeeey> http://dpaste.com/600317/ - not sure how to select the id and then manipulate it
[01:51:04] <aaronmcadam> caaakeeey: dude
[01:51:17] <aaronmcadam> $("."+this.id).
[01:52:25] <aaronmcadam> surely you want #
[01:52:32] <caaakeeey> no
[01:52:36] <dmarkey> is there a way to detect if your page has focus
[01:52:45] <caaakeeey> i want to set a class in the css
[01:52:45] <aaronmcadam> surely you want  the actual element
[01:53:01] <aaronmcadam> think you're gettin mixed up
[01:53:01] <caaakeeey> no im trying to manipulate other elements
[01:53:07] <caaakeeey> its a syntax highlighter
[01:53:11] <aaronmcadam> right I see
[01:53:16] <caaakeeey> theres a colour field with id keywrod
[01:53:28] <caaakeeey> and lots of words that havea keywrod class
[01:53:45] <caaakeeey> when i select the colour i need thiose words to change colour
[01:54:28] <caaakeeey> i literally started using js like 30 minutes ago, so sorry for sucking :D
[01:54:31] <patac> @aaronmcadam many Thanks! it worked now I know how to use $.each() sorry for being a newbie in js and jquery
[01:55:22] <dmarkey> aaronmcadam: you hang out here? :)
[01:55:41] <aaronmcadam> um yeah
[01:55:50] <aaronmcadam> ah jesus is it you
[01:55:54] <aaronmcadam> :p
[01:56:05] <aaronmcadam> no prob patac
[01:56:05] <dmarkey> aaronmcadam: at least you kept your identity a secret.
[01:56:23] <juha_> is it possible to cure world hunger using only jquery?
[01:56:31] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[01:56:37] <aaronmcadam> just use ajax
[01:58:08] <aaronmcadam> anyway u lookin for help david
[02:01:06] <aaronmcadam> what you workin on dmarkey
[02:15:25] <purefusion2> is there a way to get a jquery-ui dialog to close when the user clicks outside the dialog box?
[02:51:27] <purefusion2> if I apply a hide transition effect to the jquery-ui dialog, I can no longer re-open the dialog... the modal overlay appears, but the dialog box itself never reappears
[02:57:33] <purefusion2> how would I go about altering the speed of the dialog transition effect?
[02:59:46] <Whirl3d> if you load a document via ajax and it has a document.ready handler defined in it's header, does it run once the doc is loaded?
[03:02:16] <Whirl3d> How do I go about making "sub" pages redirect to the main page if loaded directly?
[03:03:10] <fredcpp> hi guys. I loaded some content in a a hyperlink with this: $(this).load(link+' #h2_title'); but It has the <h2> ... </h2> tags, how could I remove It and keep only the text?
[03:04:18] <Whirl3d> $(this).find("h2").remove()?
[03:05:29] <Whirl3d> or maybe you mean: $(this).text().replace("<h2>","").replace("</h2>","");   ?
[03:05:42] <fredcpp> looks like I need to sleep :P Thanks, will try.
[03:07:27] <Whirl3d> So, does anyone know if the functions in a document.ready handler are run on ajax-loaded content or not?
[03:08:47] <Whirl3d> Boy, I can sure clear a room quickly
[03:09:13] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:09:26] <aaronmcadam> em think you're a bit confused
[03:10:14] <aaronmcadam> you can use $.delegate to bind event handlers to dynamic content, see ?$.delegate @ Whirl3d
[03:10:15] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:10:50] <Whirl3d> I may not have asked correctly.
[03:11:01] <Whirl3d> I have five "pages" in separate docs
[03:11:24] <aaronmcadam> docs?
[03:11:32] <Whirl3d> I want to have the document.ready script in the head element check to see if the url ends with the filename
[03:11:43] <Whirl3d> html documents
[03:11:45] <aaronmcadam> why?
[03:12:02] <johnline3> http://jsfiddle.net/btkYT/2/
[03:12:08] <Whirl3d> if it does (like someone typed it in manually), I want to redirect to the master page
[03:12:18] <johnline3> hey peopie, can anyone help me with tabs and galleria ^^
[03:12:21] <Whirl3d> Which has the menu and garbage and uses the BBQ Hash convention
[03:12:43] <aaronmcadam> why not use htaccess for that
[03:12:44] <johnline3> each time a tab is clicked, i need galleria to refresh
[03:12:59] <Whirl3d> ?
[03:13:04] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:13:18] <aaronmcadam> if you want any page typed in manually to redirect to home
[03:13:26] <aaronmcadam> use htaccess
[03:14:02] <Whirl3d> and this won't affect ajax loading of the page
[03:14:30] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[03:14:38] <aaronmcadam> hmm actually depends
[03:14:46] <aaronmcadam> could cause it to loop back
[03:14:58] <Whirl3d> My main page uses the convention: website/index.html#pagename
[03:15:00] <aaronmcadam> dunno why it must be ajax though
[03:15:23] <Whirl3d> where pagename.html is the filename of the document that needs to be loaded
[03:15:26] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d, you know that using hashes for navigation is bad?
[03:15:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah yeah
[03:15:41] <Whirl3d> Great. So tell ben allman that
[03:15:48] <Whirl3d> It's his damned plugin
[03:15:49] <blackspotwiggins> i think he knows too
[03:15:52] <aaronmcadam> not necessarily *bad* but it sounds like a bad usecase
[03:16:01] <blackspotwiggins> no, they're actually bad
[03:16:13] <aaronmcadam> there's nothing wrong with full page reloads you know
[03:16:43] <Whirl3d> Here's the deal. I could give a rats ass. I just need to get this obnoxious project done and the only way I have found to manage history states is through the bbq plugin
[03:16:56] <blackspotwiggins> thanks mate
[03:17:03] <aaronmcadam> do u need deep linking?
[03:17:08] <Whirl3d> yes
[03:17:12] <aaronmcadam> kk
[03:17:22] <aaronmcadam> and you've watched remy sharp's tutorial on it
[03:17:44] <manuel_> how do you guys debug/develop javascript/jquery? in firebug/safari console?
[03:17:52] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[03:17:59] <Whirl3d> Everybody's got an opinion. It's really odd how just last week everyone was gung ho on bbq. Now you tell me it's bad form
[03:18:23] <blackspotwiggins> well, i could tell you to use ie6
[03:18:58] <blackspotwiggins> bbq is nice, because it works. but it uses a bad practice
[03:19:00] <aaronmcadam> well it's contentious
[03:19:05] <aaronmcadam> hash banging
[03:19:19] <blackspotwiggins> it breaks referrals, server logging and response codes
[03:19:32] <aaronmcadam> sure, apache can't see the hash
[03:19:37] <blackspotwiggins> and bookmarks
[03:19:49] <aaronmcadam> it works for deep linking
[03:19:52] <aaronmcadam> bookmarks
[03:20:05] <aaronmcadam> one of the reasons people use it
[03:20:09] <blackspotwiggins> it means you have to keep website/index.html#pagename working forever
[03:20:13] <blackspotwiggins> urls are permanent
[03:20:26] <Whirl3d> depending on how you look at it, right?
[03:20:28] <blackspotwiggins> people use it, because they saw it on twitter and think it's cool
[03:20:36] <blackspotwiggins> ajax everywhere, sweet
[03:20:40] <Whirl3d> #pagename could be programmatically any conventionm you want
[03:20:59] <blackspotwiggins> that's why twitter has to explain why they are worth a shit, because traffic from twitter.com is exactly 0
[03:21:03] <formers> has anyone loaded css files on demand ?
[03:21:05] <blackspotwiggins> due to hashbangs
[03:21:11] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: you've watched this right http://jqueryfordesigners.com/enabling-the-back-button/
[03:21:41] <Whirl3d> Yes, that's where this mess started
[03:21:58] <aaronmcadam> right
[03:22:00] <blackspotwiggins> it's easy to tell what others tell you without thinking for yourself
[03:22:06] <aaronmcadam> is there a reason why it must be ajax?
[03:22:12] <blackspotwiggins> so, enjoy dealing with all that mess later Whirl3d
[03:22:31] <Whirl3d> blackspotwiggins, why are you so hateful all the time to me?
[03:22:32] <aaronmcadam> one thing clients tend to care about most is analytics
[03:22:43] <Whirl3d> My client could care less
[03:22:47] <Whirl3d> he wants it pretty
[03:22:47] <Whirl3d> that
[03:22:49] <Whirl3d> is
[03:22:50] <Whirl3d> it
[03:22:51] <aaronmcadam> how do u know
[03:23:10] <Whirl3d> He's my boss--a big time attorney who doesn't even want a website
[03:23:22] <Whirl3d> He's 70 years old and thinks it's a waste of time
[03:23:23] <blackspotwiggins> Whirl3d, because you are a bad engineer if you just follow everything blindly
[03:23:23] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[03:23:38] <formers> Whirl3d: in all my experience, even with those that couldn't care less ask for analytics shortly after the site goes up
[03:23:42] <formers> guaranteed..
[03:23:43] <aaronmcadam> you work for an attorney? that's fucked up lol
[03:23:54] <aaronmcadam> my point exactly formers
[03:24:03] <aaronmcadam> come back in a few months looking for figures
[03:24:21] <Whirl3d> blackspotwiggins, RIght, that's why I am choosing not to listen to you telling me that I am wrong for using the current accepted way to handle back button.
[03:24:31] <blackspotwiggins> accepted?
[03:24:32] <blackspotwiggins> nywho?
[03:24:36] <blackspotwiggins> by who?*
[03:24:50] <aaronmcadam> what about history.js?
[03:24:57] <aaronmcadam> pushState, etc
[03:25:13] <Whirl3d> I'll look through the logs, but just last week about 20 people referred me to ben allman's bbq and hashchange
[03:25:14] <aaronmcadam> i thought that was the new hawtness
[03:25:15] <blackspotwiggins> if your client doesnt even want a website, why use ajax
[03:25:50] <Whirl3d> I want them to be able to drop simple html pages in a directory and have them automatically available on the web.
[03:26:30] <blackspotwiggins> so /filename.html doesnt work?
[03:26:49] <Whirl3d> Sure, but there's the menu, the pretty graphics, the background, the tooltips
[03:26:53] <Whirl3d> it goes on and on
[03:27:18] <Whirl3d> and to get them to understand that they have to include all that in every page is not gonna happen
[03:27:31] <Whirl3d> It's gonna be a bunch of word documents with .html extensions
[03:27:41] <aaronmcadam> have you never heard of a cms?
[03:27:56] <Whirl3d> No, what's that?
[03:27:57] <Whirl3d> lol
[03:27:58] <aaronmcadam> oh god html in word docs?
[03:28:05] <Whirl3d> Tell me about it.
[03:28:08] <aaronmcadam> I hope you're jokin
[03:28:14] <Whirl3d> Not in the slightest.
[03:28:25] <aaronmcadam> bout not knowing what a cms is i meant
[03:28:32] <blackspotwiggins> and you think having word htmls doesnt fuck up the site?
[03:28:40] <Whirl3d> I know about cms
[03:28:49] <Whirl3d> It certainly does
[03:28:57] <Whirl3d> It's what they want
[03:29:14] <TeddyMurray> hi, how can i select the last option of a <select>?
[03:29:15] <TeddyMurray> $('.select_item_dropdown option :last')
[03:29:21] <TeddyMurray> is returning null
[03:29:24] <TeddyMurray> well, blank
[03:29:26] <formers> That's one way to make money... they'll ask you to come back and fix it all up
[03:29:44] <Whirl3d> It's the simplest content, you would be surprised.
[03:29:56] <Whirl3d> Lots of .pdf documents too
[03:30:11] <aaronmcadam> best to explain that it won't work properly
[03:30:17] <TeddyMurray> should i be using last-child maybe?
[03:30:35] <aaronmcadam> part of our job is meant to be presenting solutions based on experience about what works and what doesn;t
[03:30:45] <Whirl3d> I guess you have never worked with an attorney before, have you?
[03:30:56] <TeddyMurray> D:
[03:30:58] <Whirl3d> Specially not an attorney that is afraid of computer
[03:31:01] <aaronmcadam> lol I work for actual agencies
[03:31:03] <Whirl3d> *computers
[03:31:23] <Whirl3d> Right. That's why he isn't having an agency do his website
[03:31:36] <Whirl3d> He doesn't like to be told "no" or "it wont work"
[03:31:46] <aaronmcadam> i bet you're being paid next to nothing too
[03:32:05] <TeddyMurray> yay i figured it out
[03:32:11] <aaronmcadam> at the end of the day you're a professional
[03:32:12] <TeddyMurray> there isn't supposed to be a space between the option and :last
[03:32:13] <g0rd0n> i am doing a fadeOut on an element and a fadeIn on another, however i would like the fadeIn to begin only when the fadeOut has finished. how can i do that? right now they both start animating at the same time
[03:32:20] <Whirl3d> I am spending way too much time on this, but when it's done, it'll be worth it.
[03:32:23] <aaronmcadam> you don't tell a doctor how to do his job
[03:32:34] <TeddyMurray> aaronmcadam, who do you work for?
[03:32:38] <Whirl3d> Bruce does
[03:32:54] <aaronmcadam> how is that relevant TeddyMurray :p
[03:33:05] <Whirl3d> In fact, he just got diagnosed with Diabetes and found a new doctor because he didn't like the treatment prescribed by his current doctor
[03:33:07] <aaronmcadam> I work on loyalty platforms
[03:33:12] <TeddyMurray> i wasn't reading your conversation until just now, aaronmcadam
[03:33:20] <formers> g0rd0n: there's a call back function
[03:33:28] <aaronmcadam> no prob
[03:33:45] <TeddyMurray> loyalty? o.O
[03:33:46] <g0rd0n> formers: ohh... ok
[03:33:50] <TeddyMurray> is that like legacy, only better?
[03:33:51] <TeddyMurray> haha
[03:34:01] <aaronmcadam> customer loyalty promotional stuff
[03:34:06] <TeddyMurray> awesome
[03:34:20] <aaronmcadam> it's ok
[03:34:26] <Whirl3d> g0rd0n, try $(item1).fadeOut(2000,funciton () {$(item2).fadeIn(2000);});
[03:34:48] <formers> g0rd0n : something like this $("#myElementId").fadeOut('slow', function(){ $('#mysecondid').fadeIn('slow');});
[03:34:52] <TeddyMurray> so you do like, the "public relations?"
[03:35:08] <aaronmcadam> hah no
[03:35:12] <g0rd0n> thank you formers / Whirl3d
[03:35:14] <aaronmcadam> I'm building a jq-mobile site
[03:35:37] <TeddyMurray> oh nice, i didn't know jquery had a mobile version
[03:35:49] <aaronmcadam> where have u been :p
[03:36:07] <formers> TeddyMurray: Its on the topic:D
[03:36:17] <TeddyMurray> nice lol
[03:36:29] <aaronmcadam> so what's your story TeddyMurray
[03:36:30] <TeddyMurray> last time i used one of my jquery applications on an ipad it worked fine though
[03:36:46] <TeddyMurray> and android too
[03:36:54] <aaronmcadam> it would do but jq-mobile is a framework for building whole apps
[03:37:06] <aaronmcadam> i.e. theming framework, apis, etc
[03:37:14] <TeddyMurray> umm, im a web developer, i build business applications and wordpress sites mostly
[03:37:20] <aaronmcadam> TeddyMurray: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b2/
[03:37:25] <TeddyMurray> https://www.odesk.com/users/~~f076c2ccd3700122
[03:38:27] <aaronmcadam> and you started this month? lol
[03:38:57] <aaronmcadam> "Aug. 2011 - Present "
[03:39:09] <TeddyMurray> lol no, ive been on odesk since 2008
[03:39:16] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah
[03:39:19] <TeddyMurray> ive been coding 12+ years
[03:39:35] <blackspotwiggins> knowledge of jquery 1.3.2 o_O
[03:39:43] <TeddyMurray> D: that test score is embarassing
[03:39:44] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:39:45] * TeddyMurray hides it
[03:40:01] <blackspotwiggins> im surprised at this test even exists
[03:40:07] <aaronmcadam> it hasn't changed that drastically tho
[03:40:24] <TeddyMurray> blackspotwiggins, lol yeah, that'st the only jquery one they had
[03:40:25] <aaronmcadam> learning jQuery 1.3 by karl swedberg is still the best book to learn
[03:40:33] <blackspotwiggins> it has IMO
[03:40:39] <blackspotwiggins> live is a pretty big deal
[03:40:46] <aaronmcadam> the API hasn't changed too much
[03:40:50] <aaronmcadam> apart from that shit yea
[03:40:53] <blackspotwiggins> also attr/prop decoupling
[03:40:58] <blackspotwiggins> and deferred ajax..
[03:41:01] <aaronmcadam> yeh yeh
[03:41:10] <aaronmcadam> I haven't used promises n shit yet
[03:41:17] <TeddyMurray> aaronmcadam, ill try jqmobile for my next project, i like the way the dialog boxes work for mobile
[03:41:25] <TeddyMurray> haven't seen other big features though
[03:41:46] <aaronmcadam> listviews, collapsables, etc etc
[03:41:55] <TeddyMurray> ahhh i see now
[03:42:02] <aaronmcadam> play with the docs
[03:42:08] <aaronmcadam> it's all jqmobile
[03:44:05] <purefusion2> I think there might be a css bug in jquery-ui's dialog... but I don't see the issue in the demos, so it's very odd... the issue is the title bar getting cut off at the top, but only if buttons are added to the dialog ...removing the ui-helper-clearfix class from the .ui-dialog-buttonpane seems to fix the issue, but I'm wondering if there's something else that might be to blame, since the dialog-with-buttons demo works?
[03:44:18] <TeddyMurray> aaronmcadam, so i built a business application and i was considering jqmobile, should i build two sites? one with jqmobile and one without?
[03:44:21] <purefusion2> Here's an example of the bug: http://eaglesuspensions.com/company/contact2.php
[03:44:26] <TeddyMurray> or should i just go with jqmobile?
[03:44:30] <aaronmcadam> it depends
[03:44:45] <aaronmcadam> on how you pare down your app's functionality for mobile
[03:45:13] <formers> TeddyMurray I'm mixing jqMobile and ui at the moment.
[03:45:21] <purefusion2> I'm seeing the bug in Firefox, Chrome and Safari on Mac... but I imagine it's also an issue on other platforms
[03:45:35] <purefusion2> any idea how I might resolve the issue?
[03:45:47] <TeddyMurray> formers, does it seem to work well on both?
[03:46:15] <aaronmcadam> TeddyMurray: jq mobile's plugins are based on jq ui
[03:46:24] <aaronmcadam> eventually we want to have the same API
[03:46:30] <formers> Yeah it does for the time being, I have certain functions available for mobile so I didn't want to repeat the build just for a mobile version
[03:46:47] <aaronmcadam> it's the same team who started jq ui who are leading jqm project, filament group
[03:46:49] <formers> plus I like the form styling
[03:46:57] <blackspotwiggins> purefusion, have you altered the css for jqui?
[03:47:17] <TeddyMurray> nice
[03:47:17] <TeddyMurray> i love jqueryui lol
[03:47:38] <aaronmcadam> it's cool but customising it can be awkward
[03:47:47] <aaronmcadam> which is why the new book from packt will be good
[03:47:55] <formers> I'm hanging out for the spinner control with 1.9 that's all that I need at the moment
[03:48:01] <aaronmcadam> waiting for my free review copy woop
[03:48:42] <purefusion2> blackspotwiggins: the only alterations I did was changing all references of url(images to url(../images
[03:50:04] <blackspotwiggins> anyway, it looks like you can fix it with additional top padding
[03:52:22] <aaronmcadam> formers I'm having an issue $.mobile.changePage( '/', { reloadPage : true } ); is recreating the page in the DOM
[03:52:28] <aaronmcadam> all I want to do is refresh the homepage
[03:53:06] <aaronmcadam> ah hmm
[03:53:13] <aaronmcadam> reloadPage (boolean, default: false) Forces a reload of a page, even if it is already in the DOM of the page container.
[03:53:13] <aaronmcadam> Used only when the 'to' argument of changePage() is a URL.
[03:53:35] <purefusion2> blackspotwiggins: cool, well I'm still curious if this is a bug or not, because if so I'd prefer to report it, but since I don't see the issue in the demos, I can't imagine it is
[03:53:44] <aaronmcadam> I can't use .html urls cuz it's django
[03:54:00] <blackspotwiggins> purefusion, it might be
[03:54:04] <blackspotwiggins> not that widespread tho
[03:54:07] <formers> srry aaronmcadam I'm new to the mobile version to offer advise
[03:54:12] <aaronmcadam> kk
[03:54:37] <solvik> hi, i'm using the jquery tablesorter module. i want some columns to be not sortable (disable images & co). i saw that's possible by using meta headers (example here: http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-meta-headers.html). but even on the example page, it doesn't work. the not-sorted columns can be sorted...
[03:55:40] <blackspotwiggins> purefusion, try setting your font-size on body to 10px
[03:55:43] <blackspotwiggins> not percentage
[03:56:55] <purefusion2> blackspotwiggins: doesn't seem to do anything :\
[03:57:03] <fredcpp> hi guys I made It work. this is the final code:
[03:57:10] <fredcpp> $(document).ready(function()
[03:57:15] <blackspotwiggins> i think it's related to that
[03:57:25] <blackspotwiggins> because everything is sized through ems in jquery ui
[03:57:25] <fredcpp> {
[03:57:35] <fredcpp> 	$("a.html").each(function() {
[03:57:41] <fredcpp> 		var link = $(this).attr('href');
[03:57:48] <fredcpp> 		$(this).load(link+' #h2_title', function() {
[03:57:54] <fredcpp> 		$(this).html($(this).html().replace('<h2 id="h2_title">','').replace('</h2>',''));
[03:58:03] <JKarsrud> fredcpp: Use a pastebin, don't paste everything in here
[03:58:07] <JKarsrud> see ?p
[03:58:08] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:58:18] <fredcpp> ^_^ and close lol
[03:58:23] <fredcpp> just in case someone ever need It
[03:58:38] <fredcpp> must take a shower, bb all and thanks for the hints.
[03:59:05] <blackspotwiggins> lol wat
[03:59:13] <blackspotwiggins> why not use unwrap..
[04:00:02] <JKarsrud> blackspotwiggins++ to me
[04:00:13] <purefusion2> blackspotwiggins: it's just weird that the title bar looks fine if there are no buttons assigned to the dialog box
[04:00:56] <cherish> hi could someone help me with an ongoing request i have..  I had some help to reorganise my code and tidy my image array up but I need to be able to update info in a div based on the longdescription of my files in image array.. I can pastebin or alt if it helps...
[04:01:33] <cherish> think its pretty much there but need to update with some code to pull in the right info on cursor clicks.
[04:02:46] <JKarsrud> cherish: paste away :) A jsfiddle test case is preferred :)
[04:02:52] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins: you done any jqm yet
[04:03:29] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, no
[04:03:31] <blackspotwiggins> i dont like it
[04:03:41] <aaronmcadam> what's the problem?
[04:03:56] <blackspotwiggins> it enforces it's own UI
[04:03:59] <aaronmcadam> lol
[04:04:08] <blackspotwiggins> i like how they fix mobile events and such
[04:04:09] <aaronmcadam> that's why you write themes for it
[04:04:25] <blackspotwiggins> theme isnt the same
[04:04:27] <aaronmcadam> any framework will "enforce" it
[04:04:38] <cherish> I have the code on a temp site at the mo.. but heres a quick paste of the image array  http://pastebin.com/C1V7Ez5X
[04:04:53] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, yeah. any UI framework.
[04:04:53] <aaronmcadam> what other ones have u tried then
[04:04:57] <Woet> does anyone know a good physics engine in jquery? i've looked into box2djs, but it looks rather bloated and lacks documentation
[04:05:23] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, i've looked at sencha touch
[04:05:36] <blackspotwiggins> it's a full blown mvc type of thing
[04:05:36] <aaronmcadam> cool
[04:05:40] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[04:05:42] <blackspotwiggins> very enterprise-y
[04:05:46] <aaronmcadam> I'm using jqm and backbone
[04:05:57] <blackspotwiggins> also full of bloat :)
[04:06:05] <blackspotwiggins> i like to keep things as lean as possible
[04:06:16] <aaronmcadam> well if it's "enterprisy" it has to be bloated
[04:06:19] <aaronmcadam> and slow :D
[04:06:23] <blackspotwiggins> but i'd rather use sencha than jqm tho
[04:06:44] <aaronmcadam> well yeah
[04:06:47] <blackspotwiggins> jqm is in this awkward place where it does UI stuff for you, but none of the data handling
[04:06:51] <aaronmcadam> if it's a full stack framework
[04:06:56] <cherish> Full  code is at http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride2.html  I need the info in div Dressinfo to update on cursor clicks left and right which are cursorRight and CursorLeft.  The info updates on thumbs clicks ..  Just need the same to happen on left and right now which are based on a mousetrap on the main image shown which is Displayed.. / imageWrapper
[04:07:04] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[04:07:10] <aaronmcadam> that's why I'm using backbone
[04:07:49] <blackspotwiggins> i'm not sure about how much stuff they've had to fix for different browsers
[04:08:00] <cherish> Can anyone recommend the best jqm gallery script going at the moment?   I need to show some info on the items being shown but not sure of which to use..  one that could take an image array would be goo..
[04:08:04] <blackspotwiggins> if they released just the fixes part of it without UI, i'd be more inclined to take a look
[04:08:11] <blackspotwiggins> right now it seems super limited and cheesy
[04:08:31] <aaronmcadam> the main challenge is events
[04:08:45] <aaronmcadam> I used jqTouch as well before
[04:08:54] <aaronmcadam> same guy on sencha touch now
[04:09:06] <cherish> <JKarsrud> sorry.. did you see that paste.. didnt direct it back at you..
[04:09:08] <aaronmcadam> main problem was with fast click on touch event
[04:09:24] <aaronmcadam> and bloody safari passing on the touch event to the next page
[04:09:55] <aaronmcadam> so you'd tap a button and that would tap the button on the next page if it was in the same position
[04:10:10] <aaronmcadam> which is why fast click was invented
[04:10:19] <blackspotwiggins> well
[04:10:36] <blackspotwiggins> i think how click worked at first is actually the right way
[04:10:42] <blackspotwiggins> for mobile
[04:10:58] <aaronmcadam> well click doesn't get fired
[04:11:04] <aaronmcadam> for a few ms
[04:11:08] <blackspotwiggins> isnt it just delayed?
[04:11:12] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[04:11:24] <blackspotwiggins> doesnt that avoid accidental taps/clicks?
[04:11:24] <aaronmcadam> it's because of how you scroll
[04:11:27] <aaronmcadam> yup
[04:11:33] <blackspotwiggins> and that's bad?
[04:11:45] <aaronmcadam> not really, it's the way the events bubble
[04:11:59] <aaronmcadam> but it's kinda sorted now
[04:24:56] <juria_roberts> is there anyway to change a DOM object to jquery object?
[04:25:42] <Bollibompa2> juria_roberts:  jQuery(object) ?
[04:26:23] <Bollibompa2> var node = document.getElementById('foo');  $(node)
[04:26:34] <juria_roberts> so is this valid jobj=jQuery(e);
[04:26:46] <juria_roberts> where e is a DOM object
[04:26:56] <Bollibompa2> yes.
[04:27:02] <juria_roberts> Bollibompa2: thanks
[04:27:22] <Bollibompa2> if you want to break out jQuery and get the vanilla object again you can do this: jQuery(e).get(0)
[04:27:29] <Bollibompa2> or jQuery(e)[0]
[04:27:37] <juria_roberts> ok thanks :)
[04:27:44] <Bollibompa2> welcome
[04:27:57] <blackspotwiggins> Bollibompa2, or possible just e ? :P
[04:28:08] <Bollibompa2> yes, if you have it cached, of course :-D
[04:28:47] <Bollibompa2> better example : jQuery('#foo').get(0)
[04:29:19] <mYrN> Hello!
[04:32:28] <mYrN> I dont know much jquery at all, i need help with making a script "live". http://jsfiddle.net/2h7L8/ Thats my script.. That works on page load, but the metabox #custom-menu-item-url is in is reloaded on-page, so when im done with whatever im doing in that box and click 'add', the metabox is reloaded on-page and the value i replaced reappears. So i guess i need it to replace the value of that
[04:32:28] <mYrN> input even if it gets added after page load
[04:35:00] <_delirium> Is there a way I can set a handler to be called before or after (doesnt matter) any jQuery ajax request?
[04:35:37] <Cork> you can set a global complete handler
[04:35:49] <Cork> ?.ajaxComplete
[04:35:49] <bot-t> .ajaxComplete(handler): Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[04:36:11] <cherish> <JKarsrud> sorry.. did you see that paste.. didnt direct it back at you..
[04:37:32] <JKarsrud> cherish: sorry, I'm at work, so I couldn't really check it.. could you repaste? =)

[04:38:28] <cherish> <JKarsrud>Full  code is at http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride2.html  I need the info in div Dressinfo to update on cursor clicks left and right which are cursorRight and CursorLeft.

[04:38:59] <_delirium> Cork: that looks good, can I set this on something like the browser, as I dont want to have to specify any particular element
[04:39:16] <mYrN> I dont know much jquery at all, i need help with making a script "live". http://jsfiddle.net/2h7L8/ Thats my script.. That works on page load, but the metabox #custom-menu-item-url is in is reloaded on-page, so when im done with whatever im doing in that box and click 'add', the metabox is reloaded on-page and the value i replaced reappears. So i guess i need it to replace the value of that
[04:39:16] <mYrN> input even if it gets added after page load
[04:39:23] <Cork> _delirium: you use $.ajaxComplete
[04:39:36] <_delirium> Cork: ah perfect, thanks
[04:39:43] <Cork> _delirium: opps sorry wrong command
[04:39:45] <Cork> one sec
[04:39:47] <JKarsrud> cherish: and what was your issue? You needed longDesc?
[04:40:50] <cherish> I need to the dressinfo div to update with the longdescription on the image array when left and right cursor is clicked...  Same kind of thing that happens when the thumbs are clicked undrneath
[04:40:56] <Cork> _delirium: i meant ajaxSetup see $.ajaxSetup
[04:41:04] <Cork> gah...
[04:41:08] <Cork> ?.ajaxSetup
[04:41:08] <bot-t> jQuery.ajaxSetup(options): Set default values for future Ajax requests. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[04:41:10] <Cork> >_<
[04:41:22] <_delirium> codepal: okay taking a look
[04:41:24] <JKarsrud> Having a bad day, Cork?
[04:41:25] <JKarsrud> :P
[04:41:28] <Cork> ya
[04:41:33] <cherish> <JKarsrud>Full  code is at http://www.chicfreakz.co.uk/romanticabride2.html  I need the info in div Dressinfo to update on cursor clicks left and right which are cursorRight and CursorLeft.  The info updates on thumbs clicks ..  Just need the same to happen on left and right now which are based on a mousetrap on the main image shown which is Displayed.. / imageWrapper
[04:42:18] <_delirium> Cork:  it says - "Global callback functions should be set with their respective global Ajax event handler rather than within the options object for$.ajaxSetup()."
[04:43:15] <blackspotwiggins> _delirium, you can bind ajax events on any object
[04:43:19] <blackspotwiggins> doesnt have to be dom
[04:43:29] <cherish> <JKarsrud> I guess I need it to be able to +1 and -1 the longdescriptions of the one shown if that makes any sense?
[04:43:58] <_delirium> blackspotwiggins: erm I have lots of different .js files in this app - and I just want to do a simple thing when any jquery ajax request is made - should that be okay?
[04:44:10] <blackspotwiggins> sure
[04:44:14] <blackspotwiggins> bind to window or document

[04:45:51] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[04:48:10] <_delirium> blackspotwiggins: perfect thanks
[04:48:21] <_delirium> Cork: thanks that was just what I needed
[04:49:21] <JKarsrud> cherish: well, why don't you just call that showDressInfo() on the previous/next button click? You know which element you're at in the array, so you can just fetch it again with images[index].longDescription ?
[04:51:10] <cherish> <JKarsrud> could you advise which way round I need to do this as I am a bit stuck :(...
[04:55:01] <cherish> <JKarsrud> I would really appreciate any advice you could give as Its been a bit of a blocker for a while..
[04:59:26] <purefusion2> how would I launch (or maybe set autoOpen: true) on a dialog if that dialog's #element-id is in the url?
[04:59:33] <cherish> <JKarsrud> I understand what you mean.. but not sure of what I need to add in..  I need to spend more time learning jquery when I get time but just weve just had a baby and so time is a little short at the mo... :(

[05:54:59] <DragoneneWork> wah
[05:55:20] <DragoneneWork> slightly offtopic, but I'm trying to do a document.getElementById("blah"), and I've a table with attribute id="blah"
[05:55:42] <DragoneneWork> why does the getelementbyid call return null?
[05:57:03] <nail_> DragoneneWork: do you call that after the dom being ready?
[05:58:03] <DragoneneWork> probably not. I'm not using jquery for this one, so I don't have a ready function
[05:58:11] <DragoneneWork> should I just do it onload or something?
[05:59:29] <DragoneneWork> ah, yes, doing it on <body> onload seems to have fixed it
[05:59:30] <DragoneneWork> thanks nail_
[05:59:39] <nail_> either that or use your own dom ready implementation if you really dont want jquery :)
[05:59:43] <nail_> np
[05:59:54] <DragoneneWork> well, i need the page to be relatively lightweight
[06:00:10] <DragoneneWork> my boss asked me not to use php for it, so I guess downloading jquery is also out of the question
[06:01:45] <DragoneneWork> ok, another quick question: i have a bunch of divs in roughly this structure: http://pastebin.com/tX0w5KCz
[06:02:15] <DragoneneWork> i want the divs with the "nthchildclass" class to have a different background-image depending for every other row
[06:02:36] <DragoneneWork> but the nth-child / nth-of-type elements don't seem to pick it up, as they're all the *first* child of their parent element
[06:03:02] <discountrobot> why did you choose a table layout
[06:03:05] <DragoneneWork> is there any way to make css pick it up as I want to, or should I do nth-child on an element higher up in the hierarchy and then work my way down from there?
[06:03:17] <DragoneneWork> i didn't
[06:03:26] <DragoneneWork> I'm modifying old code :)
[06:03:39] <DragoneneWork> but i have nothing against tables
[06:04:49] <DragoneneWork> never mind, got it working by applying the nth-child to the table element rather than the innermost dicv
[06:04:51] <DragoneneWork> div*
[06:04:52] <nail_> #something table:nth-child(X) .nthchildclass ... not sure if that's what you meant
[06:05:08] <discountrobot> you cant do that
[06:05:30] <nail_> (X's to the replace)
[06:05:31] <discountrobot> since they are divided into separate tables
[06:05:47] <graingert> anyone know a good plugin that would let me style my table cells based on standard deviation from the mean ?
[06:06:00] <graingert> jquery plugin or otherwise
[06:06:41] <fayimora> hey guys, query newbie here
[06:06:57] <graingert> fayimora: heya
[06:07:05] <fayimora> do i have to know javascript to be good at jquery?
[06:07:08] <fayimora> hi
[06:07:11] <nail_> discountrobot: yes you can
[06:07:26] <DragoneneWork> nail_: ye, that's what I did
[06:07:47] <DragoneneWork> worked just fine :)
[06:07:50] <discountrobot> sorry, im such a clown
[06:08:38] <graingert> this seems good http://www.jnathanson.com/blog/client/jquery/heatcolor/index.cfm

[06:20:52] <xlogic> Hi!
[06:20:53] <formers> can someone recomend a minifier ?
[06:21:25] <blackspotwiggins> formers, uglify.js
[06:21:37] <formers> ta
[06:21:41] <xlogic> Can anyone recomend a unified and trusted place to search for jquery active plugins ?
[06:21:55] <blackspotwiggins> cherish, so what exactly do you want?
[06:22:07] <formers> xlogic : jquery.com
[06:22:20] <formers> xlogic: google.com
[06:22:35] <formers> I find the latter the better option
[06:25:19] <xlogic> formers: the plugins list at jquery.com is usually updated?
[06:25:23] <cherish> <blackspotwiggins> I have an image wrapper which pulls the image src and longdescription from an image array.. It adds the longdescription to the dressinfo div when the thumbnail is clicked..  I have some mousetrap cursors left and right which when clicked open the previous or next image into the image wrapper but the dress info stays the same as it is not linked to the cursors  so I need it to pick up the previous and next or just r
[06:25:51] <cherish> <blackspotwiggins> I have the code on a temp site at the mo.. but heres a quick paste of the image array  http://pastebin.com/C1V7Ez5X
[06:27:01] <formers> xlogic: some aren't and some are... my only issue with plugins on jquery.com is that you have to sift through to find the good ones
[06:27:24] <blackspotwiggins> cherish, what's stopping you from doing what you were suggested in the first place?
[06:28:23] <cherish> <blackspotwiggins> I am just a  bit stuck and just needed some help on the code..
[06:28:28] <aaronmcadam> yeah we need a new curated site for plugins
[06:28:47] <aaronmcadam> http://jquerylist.com/ is the closest I've found formers, xlogic
[06:28:52] <blackspotwiggins> cherish, so you think we should do your work for you?
[06:29:20] <cherish> <blackspotwiggins> no not at all.. I was just looking for some guidance
[06:30:16] <xlogic> aaronmcadam: you bet, the problem is that there are so many plugin resources that they should be somehow managed
[06:30:26] <xlogic> and jquery.com plugins list has always been a mess
[06:30:29] <aaronmcadam> yeah it's a pain
[06:30:30] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[06:30:31] <aaronmcadam> always
[06:30:43] <aaronmcadam> stuff in there that works with 1.2/1.3
[06:31:15] <formers> aaronmcadam: thanks for the site, didn't know that existed
[06:31:21] <aaronmcadam> np
[06:31:25] <aaronmcadam> it's been going for a while
[06:32:22] <cherish> <blackspotwiggins> sorry if I have asked too many questions.. I was just really stuck with it.. :(
[06:32:39] <blackspotwiggins> cherish, well
[06:32:44] <xlogic> aaronmcadam ahah but it doesn't have a search :P
[06:32:45] <blackspotwiggins> you were given all the instructions
[06:32:57] <blackspotwiggins> i would tell you the same thing JKarsrud did.
[06:33:08] <aaronmcadam> you just click around the categories xlogic
[06:34:01] <xlogic> aaronmcadam, yes but life would be easier with search and go :P !! Bahhh someone need to develop a decent repo for this
[06:34:12] <cherish> <blackspotwiggins> I need a lot more research on jquery command lines.. but was just hoping someone could help me with this one liner.. if thats all it is..

[06:51:36] <solvik> hi, i'm using the jquery tablesorter module. i want some columns to be not sortable (disable images & co). i saw that's possible by using meta headers (example here: http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-meta-headers.html). but even on the example page, it doesn't work. the not-sorted columns can be sorted...
[06:56:41] <lanmower> Will somebody help me debug a firefox 3.6 (only) jquery problem if I post full jsfiddles of it?
[06:57:37] <lanmower> I dont know the extent of the problem, but ff4 and 5 works.
[06:57:49] <aaronmcadam> sucks
[06:57:50] <jmar777> what error do you get in ff3.6?
[06:58:17] <DarsVaeda1> hi, question about combining draggables, droppables and sortables...is it possible? see this http://jsfiddle.net/kRDNN/ -> if you drag from right to left you can "add" a document, if you drag from left to right you can "delete" a document...this works...now I want to add a sortable to the left list to get it sortable, but as you can try, if you sort a document from the left list to another point in the left list, it gets added again
[06:58:43] <lanmower> its basically a ajax problem I'm experiencing, its not letting me parse the dom strings I receive.
[07:03:00] <jmar777> can you provide any more info? e.g., what's in the dom string, what happens when you try to parse, etc.?
[07:06:32] <lanmower> is jsfiddle broken?
[07:06:49] <lanmower> I'd like to show you :)
[07:06:51] <DarsVaeda1> works but is slow
[07:06:55] <lanmower> oh ok
[07:06:59] <lanmower> must be ff3.6 ;)
[07:07:15] <lanmower> oh wait lol I never clicked save
[07:07:26] <lanmower> http://jsfiddle.net/Tdh3D/
[07:07:54] <lanmower> oh no wait nm let me fix it first
[07:11:09] <sphinxxx> if i have a grid of <img> tags, whats the best way to make it drag n drop so you can swap the order of images?
[07:11:47] <cherish> <blackspotwiggins> would this be right?  $("cursorRight").click (function (images[index].longDescription) {   $(this).showDressInfo();
[07:12:13] <blackspotwiggins> cherish, not really
[07:12:18] <kborchers> ?sortable @ sphinxxx
[07:12:34] <aaronmcadam> in click you get the element as the parameter cherish
[07:12:38] <kborchers> sphinxxx: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[07:13:02] <aaronmcadam> or specifically the event itself
[07:13:29] <aaronmcadam> ?click @ cherish
[07:13:38] <cherish> <blackspotwiggins> so its all the wrong way around then
[07:13:42] <DarsVaeda1> speaking of sortables, how do I get the position it is dragged to?
[07:15:17] <DarsVaeda1> say I have "<li id="1">1</li><li id="2">2</li><li id="3">3</li>" and drag item 1 after item 3 - how do I save that into database? I mean I need to know where it is dragged, how do I get that?
[07:15:21] <blackspotwiggins> cherish, what aaronmcadam said
[07:15:37] <blackspotwiggins> maybe you should (re)learn jquery  basics ?
[07:16:12] <kborchers> DarsVaeda1: there are a number of events you can bind to (i.e. sort, change, stop, update ...) and in which ever event makes sense for your situation, you can get the index of the element in relationship to its siblings
[07:16:40] <DarsVaeda1> first I do not get the difference between change and update
[07:16:51] <DarsVaeda1> and I also do not know how to get the index :)
[07:16:55] <jmar777> ?index DarsVaeda1
[07:16:59] <kborchers> ?index @ DarsVaeda1
[07:17:06] <kborchers> stupid bot
[07:17:23] <kborchers> DarsVaeda1: http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:17:35] <jmar777> couldn't remember the syntax anyway, guess i missed the @
[07:18:01] <cherish> <blackspotwiggins> so more like $("cursorRight").click (function () {   $(this).showDressInfo(images[index].longDescription);
[07:18:02] <lanmower> ok http://jsfiddle.net/Tdh3D/3/
[07:18:15] <lanmower> this is the problem I'm experiencing with ff 3.6
[07:18:17] <kborchers> DarsVaeda1: i believe change happens while dragging if the dom has changed but update happens after the drop if the dom has changed
[07:18:20] <bot-t> jmar777, Monday, 2011-07-18 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110718.log.html
[07:18:20] <bot-t> DarsVaeda1, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:18:22] <DarsVaeda1> shouldn't I better use some prepared stuff from the sortable plugin?
[07:18:35] <lanmower> jmar777: :)
[07:18:46] <blackspotwiggins> cherish, if you are just randomly trying..
[07:19:26] <cherish> I am looking at the click page on jquery and trying to fit the elements in..
[07:20:53] <kborchers> DarsVaeda1: your best bet would probably be to bind to sortable's update event, then use the sortable's serialize method to serialize the id's and then use .ajax() to post to a script to insert into DB
[07:21:31] <DarsVaeda1> but I only need the new position of the item dragged
[07:21:41] <DarsVaeda1> having all ids is nonsense
[07:21:58] <cherish> <blackspotwiggins> so to start I am doing... $("cursorRight").click();  which is to trigger the event..so that parts right I guess..
[07:22:10] <jmar777> DarsVaeda1: then just use index() to get it in the update callback
[07:22:14] <blackspotwiggins> cherish, look
[07:22:23] <blackspotwiggins> i really suggest
[07:22:24] <DarsVaeda1> okay I'll try that, thanks
[07:22:25] <blackspotwiggins> you learn a bit
[07:22:35] <blackspotwiggins> just randomly trying shit wont work
[07:22:45] <kborchers> DarsVaeda1: ok so if you have the id of the moved item, you going to do the calcs to figure out where all of the others shifted to? why not just update all positions since the widget gets that info for you?
[07:22:48] <blackspotwiggins> noone can learn for you except you
[07:22:55] <lanmower> So yeah in case my text got lost in the channel, heres what I'm experiencing, I cant search the returned ajax in ff3.6 such as the example at http://jsfiddle.net/Tdh3D/4/ demonstrates, I would appreciate any help because I've been stuck on this problem for a while now.
[07:23:00] <jmar777> cherish: can you describe what your'e trying to do? may be easier to provide some code from a description

[07:24:38] <cherish> <jmar777> I need the info in div Dressinfo to update on cursor clicks left and right which are cursorRight and CursorLeft.  The info updates on thumbs clicks ..

[07:38:25] <lanmower> jmar777 sorry I wasnt watching, it displays the same on the first alert, the second displays nothing, but I have found a solution, it seems that replacing var with div works.
[07:39:46] <cherish> <jmar777> I need to add a function to call the correct longDescription when cursorRight or cursorLeft is clicked.. it needs to be added to this script... I am trying to work it out now as I know I need to learn it but if you could provide any pointers it would be great..
[07:44:12] <Almandhar> Hi
[07:44:59] <fayimora> sup
[07:48:43] <Cros79> hey, ASP.NET disables checkboxes by wrapping them in a span and setting disabled="disabled" on the span, how can I detect this from jQuery since disabled really isn't allowed on a span?
[07:49:59] <necromancer> lol jesus christ
[07:50:03] <necromancer> that's just awful
[07:50:06] <ravenzz> ^
[07:50:06] <Cros79> indeed
[07:50:26] <necromancer> personally i would just use something else ;)
[07:50:32] <blackspotwiggins> Cros79, $("span[disabled]") ?
[07:50:34] <Cros79> seems neither .attr or .prop can even detect it
[07:50:42] <ravenzz> did you check if there is some options, configuration parameter to prevent this?
[07:50:45] <Cros79> necromancer ;)
[07:50:54] <Cros79> ravenzz: no
[07:50:56] <blackspotwiggins> attr should tbh
[07:51:01] <necromancer> yeah attr() definitely should
[07:51:07] <ravenzz> i would look for that, before
[07:51:12] <kborchers> Cros79: have you tried $("span[disabled='disabled']") ?
[07:51:14] <blackspotwiggins> does it even work tho? setting disabled on span?
[07:51:15] <necromancer> are you trying to select all <span>s that are disabled? or are you trying to change the property (or read it)?
[07:51:22] <ravenzz> google?
[07:51:29] <Cros79> $('#ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_cblPackages_0').parent().attr('disabled')  <- returns undefined
[07:52:03] <necromancer> Cros79: might not be a direct parent. have you tried $('#ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_cblPackages_0').closest('span').attr('disabled')
[07:52:14] <Cros79> want to read the property to set it properly on the inputs since both FF and webkit ignore the asp.net solution
[07:52:18] <necromancer> Cros79: to test i'd try to select the tags with the code kborchers posted
[07:52:32] <Cros79> necromancer: thanks for the thought, but I've already verified that I have the span
[07:52:35] <blackspotwiggins> Cros79, then select spans with [disabled]
[07:52:58] <necromancer> Cros79: i was just gonna mention that, you're really gonna have a hard time with cross-browser compatibility if your server-side framework is pulling shit like that
[07:53:23] <blackspotwiggins> i always knew asp was a bit silly, but that's just ridiculous
[07:53:57] <Cros79> I think we'll work around it with some data- attribute or something
[07:54:01] <Cros79> it's really stupid
[07:54:27] <blackspotwiggins> Cros79, are you positive that the input itself isnt disabled too?
[07:54:31] <Cros79> blackspotwiggins: setting the disabled on a span does nothing except in IE
[07:54:44] <Cros79> yepp, not disabled on the input
[07:55:22] <Cros79> kborchers's selector returns spans so that might be a solution
[07:55:34] <kborchers> Cros79: that's just messed up. if the input isn't disabled, you can still use it
[07:55:48] <Cros79> that's exactly the problem
[07:55:59] <blackspotwiggins> one question from stackoverflow suggests that input has disabled too
[07:56:04] <blackspotwiggins> maybe depends on the version
[07:56:28] <Cros79> funny thing though, since the server control is disabled it won't return the true value of the input but always says false
[07:56:32] <Cros79> awesome, right?
[07:58:21] <tktiddle> I want a simple scrollable list where i can select/deselect multiple items... what's it called?
[07:58:23] <blackspotwiggins> wtf are MSFT thinking...
[07:58:36] <blackspotwiggins> tktiddle, multi-select?
[07:58:55] <kborchers> Cros79: i would probably just do something like this to clean up that mess http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/gYMn2/
[07:59:24] <DarsVaeda1> ?selectable @tktiddle
[07:59:25] <bot-t> tktiddle, UI/API/1.8/Selectable - The jQuery UI Selectable plugin allows for elements to be selected by dragging a box (sometimes called a lasso) with the mouse over the elements. Also, elements can be selected by click or drag whi... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Selectable
[07:59:28] <blackspotwiggins> tktiddle, http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/
[08:00:21] <Cros79> kborchers: yeah, not a bad idea
[08:00:22] <Gho5t> If i have a table with 10 rows in it, will this return 1 or 10? $('#tblGrid tr td:first').length
[08:01:22] <blackspotwiggins> 1
[08:01:32] <blackspotwiggins> i think
[08:01:36] <Gho5t> heh
[08:01:40] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, 1
[08:01:43] <Gho5t> ok
[08:01:47] <Gho5t> ok so to get all i need to use each()
[08:01:48] <blackspotwiggins> with :first-child it would be 10
[08:01:48] <Cros79> should be 1 since you have selected just the first td
[08:02:00] <Gho5t> ok thanks guys
[08:02:11] <Cros79> soz, what blackspotwiggins says actually :)
[08:02:13] <blackspotwiggins> also, tr is redundant there
[08:02:20] <Gho5t> yeah
[08:02:22] <kborchers> Cros79: here's a little cleaner version ... i have a problem with refactoring, even sample code. it's an addiction ;) http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/gYMn2/1/
[08:02:32] <Gho5t> unless i use first-child
[08:03:00] <blackspotwiggins> kborchers, why not $("span[disabled] :input") ?
[08:03:27] <blackspotwiggins> the disabled attr could stay on the span i think
[08:03:32] <kborchers> blackspotwiggins: cuz i wanted to remove those invalid disabled attr's on the span
[08:03:57] <blackspotwiggins> but stil, :input rather input
[08:04:05] <blackspotwiggins> selects and textareas need love too :D
[08:04:16] <kborchers> oh, good call
[08:05:13] <kborchers> Cros79, blackspotwiggins: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/gYMn2/2/
[08:06:00] <kborchers> probably don't even need the span selector
[08:06:09] <blackspotwiggins> kborchers, yeah now it depends on either
[08:06:25] <blackspotwiggins> have > :input for direct child
[08:06:44] <blackspotwiggins> or closest("span") to conform with "span :input" selector
[08:06:55] <blackspotwiggins> or jut use the previous one with find
[08:07:53] <kborchers> yeah, assuming by the original post that it is just wrapped directly around the input so probably would go with > :input and then .parent()
[08:08:53] <kborchers> i should really focus on my own work during the day ... just not as fun ;)
[08:09:53] <gnarf> kborchers: I hear that ;)
[08:09:58] <danzik17> Question about the jQuery source - in some places, I see something like 'foo bar baz'.split(' ').each(.... rather than just passing in an array of strings directly - is there any specific reason?
[08:10:15] <blackspotwiggins> danzik17, not really
[08:10:35] <kborchers> hey gnarf, maybe i can distract you for a minute. you know if _bind is documented anywhere?
[08:12:35] <gnarf> like the widget factory method?
[08:12:59] <gnarf> ajpiano might know that one, I think he was doing something with the widget factory docs
[08:14:35] <PrgmrBill> are there any gotchas about removing the checked attribute from a selector which returns multiple results?
[08:14:54] <PrgmrBill> I'm trying to do $('.checkboxes').removeAttr('checked');
[08:15:05] <gnarf> PrgmrBill: what version of jQuery?
[08:15:22] <gnarf> PrgmrBill: cuz 1.6+ you prolly want .prop("checked", false)
[08:15:30] <PrgmrBill> oooh
[08:15:37] <PrgmrBill> will try that
[08:16:06] <kborchers> gnarf: yeah, that one. just wondering if there is a way to combine these http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/EDMRw/
[08:16:45] <DarsVaeda1> I'm still stuck with sortables...when I resort an item it appears twice after in the list
[08:16:53] <Getty> what you guys point out as "js template" stuff these days? <hideafterplacingbomb>
[08:16:54] <PrgmrBill> gnarf: wow it worked! did 1.6 break BC with that change?
[08:16:59] <graingert> having an odd problem - inserting my script in a script tag does not load the function into my namespace
[08:17:05] <Woet> does anyone know a good physics engine in jquery? i've looked into box2djs, but it looks rather bloated and lacks documentation
[08:17:17] <graingert> but loading it using$.getScript does
[08:17:33] <gnarf> PrgmrBill: yeah, read up on attr/prop http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[08:17:55] <graingert> this is the file I am talking about https://github.com/graingert/jquery-heatcolor/blob/master/jquery.heatcolor.js
[08:18:08] <PrgmrBill> gnarf: sweet thanks
[08:18:11] <DarsVaeda1> is there again a mysterious option that will disallow that?
[08:18:31] <asdf2345> if ive got var a = $(element).filter(':visible'); and var b = $(element:last); how can i do if (a == b)?
[08:18:48] <erichynds> if(a[0] === b[0])
[08:18:57] <asdf2345> ok thanks
[08:18:57] <erichynds> assuming both collections contain 1 element

[08:28:55] <zero111> hey can someone help me with jqueryui. trying to use tabs and i want it to go to the url when clicked on, instead of ajax / select tab
[08:29:12] <Woet> it works for me btw, dub54
[08:29:19] <asdf2345> .click zero111
[08:29:19] <dub54> Woet: the ajax request?
[08:29:24] <Woet> yes
[08:29:33] <asdf2345> i just did exactly that
[08:29:45] <asdf2345> ill get the inside line of code
[08:30:09] <dub54> ah my fault, I see it in dev tools now
[08:30:13] <zero111> asdf2345: ok if i pm u?

[08:30:27] * Woet slaps dub54
[08:30:48] <zero111> im lookin at the docs on the site and they do have an exmaple but i cant get it working right
[08:30:50] <Woet> a) breakpoints b) proper debugging (removing window.location/adding console.log/alert) c) webserver logs
[08:30:51] <asdf2345> window.location = "url"

[08:31:33] <zero111> oops :<
[08:32:10] <zero111> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/   i see example for ...follow a tab's URL instead of loading its content via ajax
[08:32:44] <zero111> im using jq = noconflict and i replaces $.data in that code to jq.data
[08:32:47] <zero111> is that correct?
[08:33:42] <VeXii> lokking at the docs its more of a global flag on the jquery obj
[08:34:01] <VeXii> so jQuery.noConflict()
[08:34:12] <VeXii> and then change the example to jQuery.data
[08:34:40] <VeXii> zero111 :)
[08:35:38] <zero111> so if I did jq = jQuery.noConflict() . then whats the equivalent to $.data? i thought it would be jq.data. I tried using jQuery.data also but still didnt work
[08:38:13] <asdf2345> how would one create a sliding/easing effect with jquery 1.3.2?
[08:39:20] <VeXii> zero111: well i guss i returns a instance of it self but im not 100% sure. btw did you include the jqueryUI aswell ?
[08:42:57] <zero111> yes
[09:00:28] <asdf2345> how can i slide an element (to disapear) left and right in jquery 1.3.2?
[09:02:33] <balgarath> im looking to do an autocomplete on a single word inside a textarea(similar to how facebook autocompletes names typed after @, except I want it done when # is pressed for tags. any suggestions for a plugin that could handle it?

[09:37:40] <jayd3e> is there any way to make the 'this' keyword mean the same thing on the inside of a $.each() block as on the outside of it? like pass the this object in so to speak
[09:37:59] <blackspotwiggins> gnarf, about the raf debate - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/API/PageVisibility/Page_Visibility_API
[09:38:19] <kborchers> jayd3e: yes, just set a var like var that = this; and then use that inside the each
[09:38:20] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: yeah, I've seen it :)
[09:38:43] <blackspotwiggins> also, do you know how css3 anims behave in that case?
[09:38:56] <jayd3e> kborchers: that's ugly but thanks
[09:39:17] <kborchers> jayd3e: not ugly, how it's done
[09:39:41] <Brodingo> kborchers your mom is a whore but thanks
[09:40:04] <kborchers> Brodingo: hey, it pays the bills right?
[09:40:05] <jayd3e> kborchers: well mootools has an optional third variable to set 'this' and I think that is a lot cleaner, but I hate mootools
[09:40:15] <jayd3e> well not hate I guess, just prefer jquery
[09:40:17] <Brodingo> too true
[09:43:13] <saimon69> greets
[09:43:48] <saimon69> do anybody have experience in putting a kayako live chat button inside an inline jquery colorbox div?
[09:48:53] <Brodingo> ?ask @ saimon69
[09:48:54] <bot-t> saimon69, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:50:08] <necromancer> jayd3e: resetting `this` is dangerous, it's a builtin var that shouldn't be overwritten imo. i think the method of caching it to a var is not only cleaner, it allows you to "scope" `this` so you know what `this` you're talking about. you can do this endlessly down the callbacks, without running into any conflicts.
[09:50:13] <carbonhat> Am I understanding correctly that if I'm using jQuery-UI, there's no way for me to do .toggle( function(){}, function(){}; ); -- that I can only use .toggle(); to show/hide??
[09:50:45] <jayd3e> necromancer: yah that makes sense, thanks.
[09:51:27] <carbonhat> I basically want to do $('#something').click(function(){ "Either show a thing and do some stuff or hide a thing and do some stuff" });
[09:51:32] <unvs> Are there any known gotchas when accessing the :even selector in a table after moving some rows around with .prepend() and .insertBefore? I'm trying to re-stripe a table after moving rows and it works when I first stripe the unaltered table, but when I try to stripe the edited table, the moved row doesn't respect the :even selector
[09:51:32] <jayd3e> necromancer: the only problem I have with that tho, is isn't 'this' pretty large?  It would take up a lot of memory to copy it multiple times don't you think?
[09:51:47] <carbonhat> I just can't figure out the "and do some stuff" part
[09:52:40] <necromancer> jayd3e: well i've never run into an issue where i needed to cache it twice, actually :)
[09:52:52] <necromancer> i'm not sure of the size of `this`

[10:33:39] <djQuery> what up
[10:33:54] <blackspotwiggins> hey djQuery
[10:33:58] <yan__nick> Hey guys, how can I fix that? http://jsfiddle.net/ytFzM/
[10:34:38] <Brodingo> dont use a hyphen in your variable name
[10:35:18] <djQuery> yan__nick:  var slideshow-$id  did you mean to use an = sign?
[10:35:19] <blackspotwiggins> yan__nick, you cant use variable value as another variables name in this way
[10:35:36] <yan__nick> blackspotwiggins: got it
[10:35:45] <blackspotwiggins> you can use it as object property tho
[10:35:49] <yan__nick> blackspotwiggins: $id = 'slideshow-' + 5;
[10:35:51] <gochilla> i have a working demo to my prblem: http://jsfiddle.net/FHXCE/2/
[10:36:07] <djQuery> blackspotwiggins: actualy this is valid  $(".foo[data-id="+ $id + "]")
[10:36:27] <blackspotwiggins> like var a = {}; b= "name"; a[b] = 123; a["name"] == 123
[10:36:37] <blackspotwiggins> last statement would be true
[10:37:51] <yan__nick> blackspotwiggins: i've multiple slideshows on my page. if i create an array, how can i execute funcitiuons on the array items?

[10:38:17] <djQuery> yan__nick: do each of the slideshows have a container?
[10:38:36] <yan__nick> djQuery: yeah
[10:38:51] <misterm> rai
[10:39:00] <blackspotwiggins> yan__nick, sure
[10:39:18] <carbonhat> can anyone tell me why, with jQuery-UI, $('#my-div').draggable('destroy'); doesn't reset #my-div back to its original position?
[10:39:30] <djQuery> yan__nick: in the container just store what the index of the active slideshow item is
[10:39:31] <raiun> misterm talking to me?
[10:39:32] <misterm> raiun: you have two options, you can return the request object from checkStatus, or you can have your callback do whatever you want with "status"
[10:39:33] <yan__nick> djQuery: http://pastie.org/private/j0rgzz6rqmcu31ugf11tdq
[10:39:58] <misterm> raiun: well technically you could also make the request synchronous, but you don't want to do that
[10:40:25] <yan__nick> djQuery: blackspotwiggins got it?
[10:40:29] <kborchers> gochilla: your focus() works fine when you actually include jQuery
[10:40:31] <misterm> raiun: you have to understand that ajax requests are asyncrhonous, by the time the request is finished, checkStatus is already over
[10:40:45] <blackspotwiggins> yan__nick, use {} instead of []
[10:40:58] <blackspotwiggins> arrays only have integer indexes
[10:41:12] <gochilla> kborchers: sorry i just noticed that
[10:41:20] <gochilla> kborchers: updating the demo
[10:41:35] <kborchers> gochilla: already updated http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/FHXCE/5/
[10:43:19] <gochilla> kborchers: the problem is that i cannot exaclty recreate my problem... i use jquery within a JSF application. And the js part is in a fragment (templating) so it is not 1:1 with the demo. My problem there is, that the elements are not rendered yet, when i call the focus method and i have no idea how to get the event that all elements are finished rendering (visibility and display are set properly) :/
[10:43:26] <gochilla> kborchers: thx
[10:44:50] <kborchers> gochilla: i don't know anything about JSF but $(document).ready() should not run until the dom is ready. if JSF somehow changes that, not sure what to tell you
[10:46:02] <gochilla> kborchers: no it doesn't. maybe i have a wrong idea. I think, that after calling focus() the cursor should actually be placed in the text field, ready for input. is that correct?
[10:49:15] <Piratelv> Hello all, Anyone here I can ask a question about fadeOut?
[10:49:38] <misterm> Piratelv: just ask the question, if anyone can answer they will
[10:49:40] <djQuery> ?ask@piratelv
[10:49:41] <bot-t> piratelv, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:50:10] <Piratelv> Ok Not that often on irc.
[10:51:54] <Piratelv> Why doesn't a element I fadeOut hide from the DOM. It still stays visible and modifiable in the browser. (This is in FF 3.6.18)
[10:52:13] <enjoycrf> dood
[10:52:21] <enjoycrf> just look at the fade out function
[10:52:58] <djQuery> Piratelv: fadeout is not going to remove it from the dom.
[10:53:09] <Piratelv> No didn't mean remove
[10:53:18] <Piratelv> My bad.
[10:53:39] <Piratelv> I meant display isn't being set to none. It just stays block.
[10:53:43] <enjoycrf> ya it is ur bad lol
[10:53:55] <enjoycrf> cause thats how it works
[10:54:15] <enjoycrf> its called fadeOut not hideOut
[10:54:42] <enjoycrf> how the hel do i lock a layer in gimp
[10:54:49] <djQuery> Piratelv: if you want it to do that .fadeOut(funciton(){ $(this).hide();});
[10:54:55] <Piratelv> Well this is how the jquery doc's say it works. This is where my confusion comes from. ( there demo's also show this)
[10:55:00] <blackspotwiggins> Piratelv, actually it should set it to display:none
[10:55:01] <enjoycrf> exactly
[10:55:04] <enjoycrf> thats what i do
[10:55:23] <djQuery> ?source fadeout
[10:55:24] <bot-t> Line#7680 - "fadeOut: { opacity: "hide" }," - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#7680
[10:55:31] <blackspotwiggins> Piratelv, can you give and example how it doesnt work?
[10:55:32] <Piratelv> I know that work around, djQuery. It is just odd.
[10:55:43] <djQuery> did I just crash bot-t
[10:56:05] <blackspotwiggins> djQuery, it's been running flaky recently
[10:56:09] <djQuery> ?botsnack
[10:56:09] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[10:56:16] <misterm> Piratelv: when the docs say "hide" it means in terms of the colloquial sense, if you read the docs it's explicit about affecting opacity
[10:56:33] <Piratelv> it als says explictly about display:none
[10:56:43] <Piratelv> Once the opacity reaches 0, the display style property is set to none,
[10:56:55] <blackspotwiggins> Piratelv,
[10:56:57] <blackspotwiggins> Piratelv, can you give and example how it doesnt work?
[10:57:00] <misterm> Piratelv: is that not happening on your page?
[10:57:15] <Piratelv> Nope. Hmm I will try and come up with something
[10:57:24] <blackspotwiggins> it might be something else
[10:57:25] <gnarf> fadeOut should animate to 0 opacity then display:none and set opacity back to its original value
[10:57:28] <djQuery> ?demo@piratelv
[10:57:29] <bot-t> piratelv, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:57:56] <enjoycrf> or u could save urself some time
[10:58:01] <enjoycrf> and just do .hide()
[10:58:05] <enjoycrf> oncomplete
[10:59:08] <gnarf> enjoycrf: pointless from a fadeOut callback as the fadeOut will do the .hide() as well
[11:00:23] <enjoycrf> ya but if it doesnt
[11:00:34] <k1t> hey hey folks
[11:00:39] <k1t> how goes it
[11:00:50] <djQuery> ?down bot-t.com
[11:00:53] <bot-t> djQuery, It's not just you! - http://bot-t.com looks down from here.
[11:00:57] <blackspotwiggins> hah
[11:01:06] <gnarf> djQuery: bot-t.com hasn't been up for a LONG time
[11:01:12] <gnarf> at least a few months
[11:01:37] <moldy> hi
[11:02:28] <moldy> i want to trigger a click event on an <input> when another element is clicked. this works in chromium, but not in firefox. why?
[11:02:56] <enjoycrf> we learn a lot in here
[11:03:01] <enjoycrf> this is great
[11:03:07] <blackspotwiggins> moldy, what kind of input is it?
[11:03:10] <djQuery> moldy: what type of element?
[11:03:22] <blackspotwiggins> you cant mess around with file inputs for example
[11:03:58] <djQuery> <label for="inputid">Click here to focus the input</label><input id="inputid" />
[11:03:58] <moldy> djQuery, blackspotwiggins: <input type="file">
[11:04:09] <moldy> blackspotwiggins: ah, that explains it.
[11:04:17] <moldy> too bad
[11:04:44] <blackspotwiggins> moldy, it's a security risk
[11:04:51] <enjoycrf> why
[11:05:01] <moldy> blackspotwiggins: interestingly, it works in chromium
[11:05:05] <enjoycrf> security is so overrated
[11:05:19] <djQuery> enjoycrf: because the makers of the browsers say so.
[11:05:25] <blackspotwiggins> enjoycrf, give me your credit card details plx
[11:05:32] <enjoycrf> ij
[11:05:33] <enjoycrf> ok
[11:05:42] <enjoycrf> 1234123412341234
[11:05:54] <enjoycrf> john doe
[11:06:24] <enjoycrf> 12345 road hell, XX 66666
[11:06:35] <noob> any one has any example f a right click box in jquery table
[11:07:37] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[11:07:54] <raiun> how do u return a value from an ajax request within a function? http://pastie.org/2412486
[11:08:16] <wkmanire> raiun: $.post is asynchronous.
[11:08:29] <Piratelv> Ok so I guess I just have some weird race conditions with my fade code...
[11:08:36] <raiun> wkmanire so u cant do it?
[11:08:38] <gnarf> raiun: you don't you put the code that requires the value in a callback function
[11:08:45] <wkmanire> raiun: So checkStatus isn't going to wait until $.post finishes to return.
[11:09:03] <wkmanire> raiun: You shouldn't want to do it :D
[11:09:04] <gnarf> return the deferred
[11:09:19] <raiun> i see, so instead i should use $.ajax with async: false?
[11:09:32] <kborchers> raiun: oh god no!
[11:09:35] <raiun> haha
[11:09:36] <wkmanire> raiun: Nope, You should never use that.
[11:09:39] <raiun> somebody show me the light!
[11:09:41] <misterm> raiun: no, you should learn to write in an asynch style
[11:09:46] <wkmanire> raiun: Listen to gnarf.
[11:09:54] <wkmanire> raiun: Deferreds are awesome.
[11:10:04] <raiun> i dont get what he's saying
[11:10:34] <misterm> raiun: you can'r return status from checkStatus directly
[11:10:35] <dmarkey> Is there a sprintf style way of string generation in javascript
[11:10:39] <dmarkey> in jquery rather
[11:10:41] <dmarkey> i.e. "%s, %d" % ( "My Number is", 12)
[11:10:47] <raiun> misterm how do i do it indirectly
[11:10:55] <gnarf> return the $.post --- attach a success function to it later
[11:11:07] <misterm> raiun: you can either return the request object
[11:11:14] <wkmanire> dmarkey: Nothing built in, but there is a replace method on the string you can use with regular expressions.
[11:11:19] <misterm> raiun: and then tell the request object what to do when it's done
[11:11:28] <gnarf> checkStatus().done( function (status) { });
[11:11:36] <wkmanire> dmarkey: There are also a few different libraries floating around that offer that sort of funcionality.
[11:11:41] <misterm> raiun: or you can pass a function to checkStatus and have it run it when the request is done
[11:11:43] <gnarf> ?jQuery.Deferred
[11:11:43] <bot-t> gnarf, Deferred Object - jQuery.Deferred, introduced in version 1.5, is a chainable utility object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state o... http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[11:12:05] <stygyan> i was going to ask something, but now i just realized how stupid the question was.
[11:12:13] <stygyan> my bad.
[11:12:44] <raiun> how do you return the request object?
[11:12:56] <raiun> not return result; right?
[11:13:08] <raiun> save the request as a variable and return it?
[11:13:22] <wkmanire> raiun: $.post is a function. It returns a value. You want to return that value from your method.
[11:13:33] <moldy> djQuery: the <label> method doesn't seem to work for me in firefox
[11:13:56] <djQuery> moldy: probably not for a type="file"
[11:14:05] <wkmanire> raiun: function doIt { var postValue = $.post(/*stuff*/); return postValue; }
[11:14:08] <wkmanire> or even better
[11:14:19] <wkmanire> function doIt { return $.post(/*stuff*/);  }
[11:14:24] <moldy> djQuery: yeah, i guess so. too bad :(
[11:15:08] <moldy> i need to trigger the file upload indirectly because my customer insists on server-side localization of the "browse" button
[11:15:29] <wkmanire> raiun: But before you start guessing and checking, go and read the deferred documentation that gnarf posted. it will a lot more sense to you.
[11:16:00] <raiun> how do you get the responseText out of the result object?  cus .responseText just gives me undefined
[11:17:00] <gnarf> raiun: lol
[11:17:03] <Blitzz_> I'm using the jquery form plugin, but get a 404 not found error when posting data with an ajax login form. The URL exists and is a controller action within cakephp..it seems like the POST is having trouble with equal signs in the data.
[11:17:11] <gnarf> raiun: so like, the issue is it hasn't replied yet
[11:17:19] <gnarf> so you need to deferr the operation to whenever it does reply
[11:17:34] <raiun> well
[11:17:44] <raiun> when i return the $.post() it gives me a big object
[11:17:46] <raiun> and in that object
[11:17:49] <gnarf> a jqXHR
[11:17:51] <raiun> is responseText with what im looking for
[11:18:00] <raiun> if i can just get that out i'll be fine
[11:18:04] <gnarf> raiun: not until the server responds
[11:18:11] <raiun> oh
[11:18:12] <gnarf> so you have to wait until the response
[11:18:26] <wkmanire> raiun: That jqXHR object has a .done function that takes a callback.
[11:18:26] <gnarf> hence using the jqXHR to attach another callback to "done"
[11:18:30] <wkmanire> raiun: Want to guess what that does?
[11:18:52] <gnarf> although if your function is "checkStatus"
[11:18:56] <gnarf> I might pipe that deferred
[11:19:21] <gnarf> cuz the "Status" isn't the direct return value according to your thing
[11:19:27] <gnarf> ?Deferred.pipe
[11:19:28] <bot-t> gnarf, deferred.pipe() - Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[11:19:45] <Piratelv> Ok this is just stupit. In a clean test it works fine. However live with the rest fadeOut just bugs.
[11:19:59] <Piratelv> If anyone can look at it this is the live url: http://levi.mc-creative.nl/test/ppadminFrontend.php
[11:20:02] <raiun> hmm
[11:20:11] <blackspotwiggins> Piratelv, disable half the shit that could interfere at a time to find whats causing it
[11:20:14] <blackspotwiggins> binary search ftw
[11:21:08] <ravenz_> nice background :S
[11:21:12] <Piratelv> They only thing I could disable it the ajax request in the middle of the animation. But that's the core why I want one.
[11:21:26] <gnarf> return $.ajax({ url: url, type: "POST", dataType: "json"  }).pipe( function( data ) { return result['Auction']['status'] });
[11:21:47] <gnarf> then checkStatus().done( function ( status ) { console.log(status); });
[11:28:19] <scroogemcduck> hello
[11:29:00] <Piratelv> Hi
[11:30:17] <wkmanire> scroogemcduck: Sup uncle.
[11:31:09] <Blitzz_> I'm using an ajax login form that works with GET, but if I use POST, I get a 404 not found error
[11:31:19] <Brodingo> quack
[11:32:05] <wkmanire> Blitzz_: Assuming the URl is the same, just missing the query string, then this would indicate a server problem.
[11:32:40] <wkmanire> Are you certain your server handles POST for that url?
[11:33:14] <Blitzz_> wkmanire: What do you mean by handle POST?
[11:33:46] <Blitzz_> wkmanire: Right now all it does is echo back a meaningless string
[11:34:06] <wkmanire> Blitzz_: It really depends on your server software.
[11:35:18] <Blitzz_> wkmanire: I was able to handle POSTs fine with a non-ajax form though
[11:35:24] <wkmanire> Blitzz_: It is possible (and likely) for your server to return some content for a POST request even when it returns a 404 status code.
[11:35:49] <wkmanire> Blitzz_: jQuery wants to see a non error code. Such as 200, come back from the server.
[11:36:56] <wkmanire> Blitzz_: Do you know how to use cURL?
[11:37:06] <wkmanire> Blitzz_: It is particularly useful for troubleshooting these kinds of problems.
[11:37:06] <Blitzz_> wkmanire_: I don't receive a response with the 404 not found, but I do get a response when using get. With post, it never even reaches the function on my server
[11:37:59] <wkmanire> Blitzz_: What platform are you using?
[11:38:18] <Blitzz_> wamp and cakephp
[11:38:44] <scroogemcduck> does anynoe know how you can split up a <ul> list?
[11:38:58] <scroogemcduck> I want to have seperate <ul> every 6 items, is that possible?
[11:39:13] <wkmanire> I'm not that familiar with cake but I think it is an MVC pattern right?
[11:39:28] <Piratelv> !ch
[11:39:31] <Blitzz_> wkmanire_: yeah, cakephp is MVC
[11:39:39] <mstrom> Hi there, I have a jquery ajax question.....
[11:40:00] <wkmanire> Blitzz_: Do you have specify the HTTP Method when you are setting up your routes?
[11:40:38] <mstrom> My ajax call is going through ok, and the status is a 200.  When using Firebug, I notice that a jquey.js packed file (included with Drupal) is called and something errors out there.
[11:40:53] <Blitzz_> wkmanire_: there are some internal routes set up that I haven't touched. The only route I set up is to route the root "/" to my home page
[11:41:08] <wkmanire> I see :/
[11:41:31] <Blitzz_> wkmanire_: jquery seemed like it didn't like equal signs in my post data
[11:41:56] <Blitzz_> wkmanire_: I noticed that if I called encodeURI() on my post data, it got rid of the 404 not found error
[11:42:08] <wkmanire> Blitzz_: I'm pretty sure that jQuery encodes the data it sends in.
[11:42:19] <wkmanire> Can I see a pastebin of your post call?
[11:42:43] <Blitzz_> wkmanire_: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1809927391
[11:42:58] <wkmanire> 404 is a weird error code to get back for unescaped entities.
[11:42:59] <zero111> can someone help me with jqueryui tabs. I just want it to just load the linked url when the tab is selected (not ajax). http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#...follow_a_tab.27s_URL_instead_of_loading_its_content_via_ajax  doesnt work for me.
[11:43:12] <wkmanire> I would have expected 500.
[11:45:53] <wkmanire> Blitzz_: Are you using a plugin for handling your form?
[11:46:05] <Blitzz_> wkmanire_: the jquery form plugin
[11:46:56] <wkmanire> ah ok, I haven't used that. I'm pretty sure you can just pass an object to $.ajax and it will properly encode all of the members.
[11:47:27] <wkmanire> At least you got it working.
[11:47:30] <Blitzz_> wkmanire: seems like something strange is going on
[11:47:50] <wkmanire> yeah
[11:47:59] <wkmanire> I see you used $.param
[11:48:12] <wkmanire> That is intended for query strings.
[11:48:16] <wkmanire> Not sure if that works for post data.
[11:48:54] <Blitzz_> wkmanire: it should work for post data too
[11:49:35] <Blitzz_> wkmanire: Thanks for your help!
[11:49:53] <wkmanire> Not sure if I helped more than I just asked questions.
[11:49:54] <wkmanire> he he
[11:49:56] <wkmanire> but no problem.
[11:50:31] <Blitzz_> wkmanire: Maybe I'll look into cURL
[11:51:05] <wkmanire> It's a nice utility.
[11:51:13] <wkmanire> You can do practically any type of request.
[11:51:23] <wkmanire> Including SSL stuff.
[11:51:34] <wkmanire> I think it even handles cookies for sessions.
[11:51:35] <Blitzz_> wkmanire: So it basically makes the POST request for me to test the server
[11:51:47] <wkmanire> All from the command line
[11:51:52] <wkmanire> So you can see exactly what text is coming back from the server.
[11:51:59] <Blitzz_> that's nice
[11:52:06] <wkmanire> it is really easy for server side code to jack up status codes and content etc...
[11:53:00] <wkmanire> It's sort of the developers swiss army knife for troubleshooting webservers.
[11:54:32] <Blitzz_> wkmanire: I actually changed to not use params before. I basically call serialize on my form to get the form data http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1790950785
[11:55:38] <wkmanire> There is only ever 1 form in your page right?
[11:55:44] <Blitzz_> yes
[11:55:54] <Pymous> Hello!
[11:56:02] <Pymous> Someone know why this isn't working ? :)
[11:56:02] <Pymous> http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/32/
[11:59:03] <wkmanire> Pymous: Yes
[11:59:29] <wkmanire> Pymous: Why did you add the argument 500 to your call to $.slideUp?
[11:59:40] <Pymous> Oh... I see...
[11:59:43] <Pymous> I'm so stupid...
[11:59:47] <Pymous> wront arguments ><
[11:59:49] <Pymous> wrong
[11:59:50] <wkmanire> Pymous: :P
[11:59:52] <Pymous> Thanks you :)
[11:59:56] <wkmanire> 500 is not a function.
[12:00:09] <wkmanire> If you awnt the animation to take 500 milliseconds make it the first argument
[12:00:23] <wkmanire> The second arg to all of those animations is a callback function which is called when the animation completes.
[12:00:43] <Blitzz_> pymous: that's pretty neat, can't wait to unlock the power of jquery
[12:01:20] <wkmanire> Pymous: http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/34/
[12:01:21] <Pymous> It's not really JQuery related, but for futur stupidity from me, does a kind of 'debuger' exist ?
[12:01:23] <Pymous> For NetBeans /3
[12:01:38] <wkmanire> Pymous: Not for javascript I don't think
[12:01:46] <wkmanire> but you don't need a debugger in netbeans
[12:01:53] <wkmanire> Chrome and Firefox have excellent javascript debuggers
[12:01:53] <Pymous> Why ?
[12:02:07] <Pymous> Oh ? Do you know one 'easy' ?
[12:02:11] <Pymous> For a peasant like me
[12:02:24] <wkmanire> No need to talk yourself down.
[12:02:27] <wkmanire> I prefer chrome
[12:02:42] <wkmanire> but a lot of people like the firebug extension for firefox
[12:03:14] <Pymous> I'm using chrome ^^
[12:03:26] <Haprog> Pymous: just hit F12 then
[12:03:32] <wkmanire> Ultimately you will need to learn whatever debugging tools are available for every browser.
[12:03:47] <wkmanire> You'll occassionaly have problems that only happen in IE.
[12:03:50] <wkmanire> :D
[12:03:54] <Pymous> \o/
[12:04:04] <Pymous> When I hit F12, Firebug Lite open
[12:05:34] <zero111> use the menu wrench->tools->developer tools in chrome
[12:06:00] <Haprog> Pymous: on Chrome it should open Chrome Developer Tools not Firebug. You can also access it from the menu like zero111 just explained or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I
[12:06:18] <Haprog> http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/
[12:06:21] <Pymous> Neat :P
[12:06:59] <Pymous> Thanks you
[12:08:32] <freeed> hey everyone, i'm working on some form validation and wondering what the most efficient method would be. I've attached a .submit() function to the form and am selecting each input that I need to check the value of with $(this).find('input[name=contactName')... is that the best way to select specific children of the form? Thanks!
[12:09:09] <freeed> er typo, [name=contactName]
[12:09:28] <enjoycrf> thats not so efficient
[12:09:33] <enjoycrf> i think
[12:09:54] <enjoycrf> is there something like $form.each()
[12:11:31] <freeed> enjoycrf, sure, I can check each input in a loop, but I would then be running something like if ($(this).attr('name') == 'contactName')) { do something }   not sure if that is as taxing, i.e. is it more efficient to run a new select or to query the .attr()
[12:12:31] <freeed> or with .prop() actually
[12:14:01] <freeed> enjoycrf, a loop would also require checking every input item for the few that need validation, which could be inefficient
[12:14:21] <enjoycrf> well yeah
[12:14:25] <enjoycrf> in that case
[12:14:44] <enjoycrf> i still would use search selector
[12:14:47] <enjoycrf> nt
[12:15:08] <enjoycrf> unless its for 1 or 2 elements
[12:17:24] <freeed> mmm ok... but there isn't some other form validation / jquery workflow I don't know about? i.e. something like $(this).input('contactForm') instead of usign .find()
[12:18:05] <zero111> add a class to each el that need validated? get the els using class selector with context=form and do ur stuff?
[12:18:17] <enjoycrf> yep
[12:18:23] <enjoycrf> exactly
[12:19:07] <enjoycrf> that can kill 2 birds w 1 stone
[12:28:34] <Jon47> does anybody know how to use an xpath attribute selector to match a period?  When I try it, I get this error:
[12:28:34] <Jon47> "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [src$=.gif]"
[12:28:34] <Jon47> I also tried escaping the period with a backslash..
[12:29:25] <Jon47> with jquery version 1.6.2
[12:29:44] <Jon47> here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/4eTjq/
[12:29:46] <Cork[home]> Jon47: $('[src$=".gif"]')
[12:29:56] <Jon47> Cork, oo thank you sir
[12:33:58] <gnarf> yeah, attr selectors REQUIRE quotes
[12:35:52] <SinnerNyx> does jquery have any built in support for draggable elements?

[12:39:46] <Brentonator> Where can I find a full list of "potentially breaking changes" for each version released after 1.3.2
[12:39:50] <pickels> Anybody know if you can move the next and previous month navigation below the grid of dates with the jquery ui datepicker?
[12:41:04] <Brentonator> Does $(function() { }); shorthand no longer automatically translate to $(document).ready() really?
[12:41:50] <snover> Brentonator: the 1.4 list is on 14 days of jquery, the remaining lists are in the blog
[12:44:45] <Brentonator> I'm not too happy that I can't find a changelog list like we have for JQuery UI
[12:45:00] <zero111> jqueryUI tabs question: can someone tell me why I cant get this to work with jQuery.noConflict(). The code is there (commented out).
[12:45:26] <zero111> http://jsfiddle.net/mKTqf/2/
[12:45:27] <zero111> err
[12:45:34] <zero111> jqueryUI tabs question: can someone tell me why I cant get this to work with jQuery.noConflict(). The code is there (commented out). http://jsfiddle.net/mKTqf/2/
[12:52:19] <gnarf> zero111: if you're using noConflict, $ doesn't exist
[12:52:29] <gnarf> it should be using whatever local alias you defined, in this case "jq"
[12:52:34] <zero111> i know i changed that to the jq
[12:52:43] <gnarf> you still have a $
[12:53:02] <zero111> oh right
[12:53:07] <zero111> let me see again :)
[12:53:44] <zaxis42> I would like to make a kiosk, do you suggest HTML5 or Flash?
[12:55:21] <Brodingo> id use like particle board or something
[12:55:27] <gnarf> I want to make a sandwich, do you suggest white or wheat bread?
[12:55:46] <Brodingo> or maybe some kind of plastics
[12:55:52] <zero111> gnarf: ok that was it! ty need new glasses :)
[13:05:23] <James13433> Hi I have a variable, lets say for example called "selectvariable", is it possible to get the value of that variable using the text value of a select attribute, if the variable name is the same as the select text?
[13:06:23] <James13433> something like alert(jQuery('#select_98569 :selected').text()) - but obvously that just alerts the .text not the variable with the name of the value of .text
[13:06:32] <jaequery> hey guys
[13:06:37] <jaequery> wheres everyone from?
[13:06:41] <jaequery> anyone in US?
[13:07:31] <James13433> Anybody understanding what I mean or even just here?#
[13:15:02] <James13433> I have done this pastebin to try and explain a little better http://pastebin.com/AysyMrEm
[13:16:09] <kborchers> James13433: not sure why you would ever do something like that but you could try http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/sF7dT/
[13:16:39] <Brodingo> yeah for inputs you want .val() not .text()
[13:18:50] <kborchers> James13433: don't know why you wouldn't just put your the values you want in the option values http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/sF7dT/1/
[13:20:11] <zaxis42> I would like to make a kiosk, do you suggest HTML5 or Flash?
[13:20:59] <James13433> kbrochers, the value Is needed for the price of the option
[13:21:49] <moi_> Hey guys. I'm trying to navigate through form fields using the arrow keys. What do I need to do in order to do this ? Is there a library or something for this ? I'm very new to jquery so excuse my noobishness
[13:21:59] <James13433> also due to my cms, the image src comes from a completely different file from the select box
[13:23:00] <kborchers> James13433: ok, still seems like an icky way to do that, but eval is what you want from that first example
[13:24:25] <discountrobot> James13433
[13:24:44] <James13433> yes discountrobot?
[13:26:01] <discountrobot> what do you mean by Image1 = http://www.website.co.uk/image_8767.jpg
[13:26:19] <James13433> variable image1 = http://www.website.co.uk/image_8767.jpg
[13:26:34] <James13433> mabey that should be in ""
[13:28:30] <James13433> should this be working, if optionValueText = Black, and productImgBlack is set, console.log("productImg" + eval(optionValueText));
[13:28:54] <snover> eval? what the fuck is this shit
[13:28:56] <snover> ?eval
[13:30:09] <James13433> ahh eval, should be on the outside
[13:30:14] <snover> no
[13:30:16] <snover> eval should be nowhere
[13:30:17] <snover> ever
[13:30:20] <snover> if you are using eval, you are doing it wrong.
[13:30:29] <kborchers> snover: i know right, i answered his question about "how" to do it, with the caveat of not to do it
[13:31:00] <James13433> Well thats the only way I can think of
[13:31:34] <James13433> I dont want to have to load the image and then hide it because they are large images.
[13:31:55] <snover> James13433: start by pasting some code that is actually valid
[13:32:17] <kborchers> preferably not pasting it in here
[13:32:42] <James13433> ok right then...
[13:33:58] <snover> then learn about arrays. then learn about array notation. in fact, don’t write another character of code until you read http://eloquentjavascript.net
[13:34:09] <Woet> +1 snover
[13:38:12] <James13433> snover me?

[13:41:27] <James13433> http://jsfiddle.net/g7d9s/1/ even
[13:42:01] <James13433> The aim is to update the image, with the image that is the correct image for the color inside the selecte value
[13:42:07] <snover> yes you.
[13:47:14] <sjk> I'm trying to create tooltips by using the "Jquery Tools" library (http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/index.html) and I just can't get it to work
[13:47:58] <sjk> I'm trying to have some <a> elements title values appear as tooltips on http://sjk.ankeborg.nu/new4/ (on the navigation bar)
[13:48:04] <sjk> Would love some pointers
[13:50:29] <iwoj_> i need to serialize an array into a JSON string. Can jQuery do this for me?
[13:50:36] <iwoj_> What's the best way to do it?
[13:50:48] <tbranyen> iwoj_: use the JSON api
[13:50:52] <iwoj_> which one?
[13:50:53] <tbranyen> JSON.stringify({ some: obj })
[13:50:56] <tbranyen> its built in
[13:50:59] <FLeiXiuS> I have an ajax div that loads with an ID of 'foo.'  I have jquery attach a bind event to all 'foo' elements.  But the foo div loads before the  javascript
[13:51:04] <tbranyen> include json2.js for older browser support
[13:51:05] <iwoj_> all browsers have it?
[13:51:29] <FLeiXiuS> Is there a way to refresh the IDs of the page so that the javascript can recognize the newly loaded div?
[13:51:34] <FLeiXiuS> If that make sense.
[13:51:37] <iwoj_> ah. thanks tbranyen
[13:52:22] <enjoycrf> i have a donut problem
[13:52:31] <tbranyen> enjoycrf: doughnut*
[13:52:37] <tbranyen> unless you specific mean dunkin donuts
[13:52:38] <james13433> Got discounnected did anybody say anything to me?
[13:53:06] <enjoycrf> how do i return the lowest value
[13:53:09] <enjoycrf> of an array
[13:53:15] <enjoycrf> i mean the lowest key
[13:53:21] <enjoycrf> like php sort
[13:53:26] <enjoycrf> by key
[13:53:43] <tomasm-> is it possible to get just direct text children of an element? ignoring other sub-elements (which have text)
[13:53:58] <enjoycrf> like if i have array[100]
[13:54:04] <enjoycrf> and array[300]
[13:54:14] <enjoycrf> how do i return array[100]
[13:55:18] <tomasm-> basically i want to call jquery(element).text(), but ignore descendents
[13:56:39] <mstrom> I have an ajax question.  Upon the click of a link, I have some Drupal code that is invoked, along with some ajax code.  The Drupal code refreshes the page.  This might be causing an issue in my ajax code because it seems that it's invoking the unload event while my ajax is still running.  Would that cause my XHR object to go from having a 200 status to a 0 status?
[13:57:05] <JKarsrud> enjoycrf: you have array like var array = [100, 300] or what?
[13:57:25] <enjoycrf> yeah
[13:57:27] <ccmonster> does the drupal event need to occur first?
[13:57:38] <mstrom> Yes
[13:57:55] <mstrom> Ideally, but actually not necessary.
[13:58:05] <enjoycrf> well more like array[100] = this
[13:58:07] <ccmonster> so what sort of ajax event is this? you are setting yourself up for failure if you are expecting an ajax call on a page being refreshed
[13:58:13] <enjoycrf> aray[200] = that
[13:58:27] <mstrom> ccmonster, yeah that's what I'm worried about.
[13:58:42] <mstrom> The ajax needs to refresh a Drupal block after the Drupal event is complete.
[13:59:04] <ccmonster> so it needs to to ajax in a block of content?
[13:59:10] <JKarsrud> so it's actually more like var obj = { 100: this, 200: that }; ?
[13:59:27] <JKarsrud> is it an array or an object?
[13:59:30] <ccmonster> and the drupal event is actually causing the page to refresh/load?
[13:59:46] <mstrom> ccmonster:  yes.  It needs to refresh that block.  The Drupal event is also causing the refresh, yes.
[14:00:14] <enjoycrf> yeah
[14:00:20] <ccmonster> so everythime the page refreshes/loads, does this drupal block need to be pulled?
[14:00:21] <enjoycrf> thats find too
[14:00:52] <ccmonster> ?
[14:01:00] <mstrom> ccmonster:  Yep, but after the Drupal event refresh, the block might still need to be refreshed again.  That's what the ajax is for.
[14:01:17] <mstrom> This is because of some JMS messaging and other processing.
[14:01:21] <ccmonster> well if your page is being refreshed, it's being 'loaded' right?
[14:01:33] <ccmonster> the drupal event isn't an ajax event as well, right?
[14:01:39] <mstrom> correct
[14:01:54] <ccmonster> ok, then put the jquery ajax event in the doc.ready
[14:01:59] <janthony> $("input[name='brand']", "input[name='brand[]']") - Is there a way to do this, allow multiple selectors?
[14:02:02] <ccmonster> because, it needs to occur once the page actually loads
[14:02:34] <mstrom> ccmonster:  it's there and it's getting invoked just fine.  The issue is that the XHR object is getting changed.
[14:02:50] <janthony> n/m got it, had to remove the "," before and after the ,
[14:02:50] <ccmonster> ?demo @ mstrom
[14:03:07] <ccmonster> you got a demo mstrom
[14:03:32] <bakers> If I have a text area with val = "123abc456" how do I make the selection abc? Like I want to select chars 4 through 6
[14:03:37] <mstrom> Nope, sorry.  It's behind a firewall.  After the call, it's a 200.  And then right after that something happens where it gets an error.
[14:04:09] <mstrom> I'm wondering if it could be the refresh of the page because of the Drupal event?
[14:04:40] <ccmonster> probably
[14:04:52] <mstrom> ccmonster, thanks for your help.
[14:05:16] <ccmonster> sounds like you need to do some callbacks to ensure that your ajax refresh doesn't occur until the refresh occurs mid xhr
[14:05:32] <mstrom> ccmonster: good idea!
[14:13:53] <mwarning> hi, how can I go towards the root node using a while loop? I tried while(n.attr("id") != "nav") {  alert("node " + n.nodeName); n = n.parentNode(); }, but this always prints "node undefined" always.
[14:14:19] <mwarning> I get alert only once always.
[14:16:37] <sunscreen> hmm
[14:16:57] <sunscreen> can some one help us out here
[14:17:26] <sjk> With what?
[14:19:52] <sunscreen> google vis geoChart API has configuration option which you setup options = { options1: bla, options2: bla }; .. but what if its called: options1.stroke ... i tried to do options= { options1.stroke: '#FF0000' }; but it does not like it " unexpected token . "
[14:49:03] <aeo> Guys, I think I found a jQuery bug.
[14:49:14] <aeo> In IE7, this crashes on turn 2: http://pokemon.aesoft.org/replay-panamaxis-vs-Scofield--2011-04-09-private928595837
[14:49:21] <donburks> Bold statement.
[14:49:25] <aeo> I know.
[14:49:34] <aeo> That's why I haven't reported it yet, it might just be me who's being stupid.
[14:50:05] <aeo> Anyway, the above link crashes when you click "Play" on turn 2 in IE7 (or at least IE9 in compatibility mode)
[14:50:19] <aeo> The call stack was all jQuery, down to the tick function
[14:50:53] <aeo> IE7's error message was "SCRIPT87: Could not get the display property. Invalid argument."
[14:51:06] <aeo> The offending code was: a.elem.style[a.prop] = ...
[14:51:19] <SirCmpwn> whenever anyone has time, there's a very simple website up at http://astrodynamicsstandards.org with unobsfucated source that doesn't show the content animations until after you've already shown that content once
[14:51:30] <aeo> a.prop was 'display', and a.elem.style['display'] was 'block', so it shouldn't have crashed.
[14:51:44] <SirCmpwn> * http://astrodynamicstandards.com
[14:53:15] <donburks> SirCmpwn: What's your actual question? I'm confused by what you're saying vs. what I see in the source code.
[14:53:17] <SirCmpwn> you can see the bug by clicking any of the links on the left navigation, clicking on a different one, then returning to the first one.  You should only see the animation the second time
[14:53:38] <SirCmpwn> the behavior I'd like is to see the animation on the first time as well
[14:54:55] <SirCmpwn> I think the problem is related to styles, and I'd have to change the initial style that each content div takes
[14:55:09] <SirCmpwn> it's currently arranged with a bunch of divs that are all hidden, save for the active one
[14:57:51] <aeo> Oh, I see the problem.
[14:58:00] <SirCmpwn> \o/
[14:58:03] <aeo> Sorry
[14:58:09] <aeo> I meant to my own code, not to yours. :(
[14:58:15] <SirCmpwn> ;_;
[14:58:15] <aeo> fx.elem.style.display = 'blockNaNpx'
[14:58:33] <aeo> Looks like a jQuery bug
[14:59:33] <aeo> aha
[14:59:46] <aeo> elem.animate({display: 'block'})
[14:59:49] <aeo> is what's making it crash
[15:01:18] <aeo> I've fixed my own site, but I think jQuery should be able to handle elem.animate({display: 'block'})
[15:02:00] <donburks> How, that's not a numeric property.
[15:02:10] <donburks> .animate() clearly says it's for animating numeric properties.
[15:02:19] <gnarf> aeo: animate can only handle numerics
[15:02:31] <donburks> If you want to animate display: block, try .fadeIn()
[15:02:58] <aeo> gnarf: But it should error out, not crash the whole browser.
[15:03:28] <donburks> a) No. b) It's IE. All bets are off.
[15:04:06] <gnarf> aeo: edge case... bad data in = unexpected results
[15:05:13] <kaputtmacher> hi there
[15:05:19] <donburks> Ahoy.
[15:05:48] <kaputtmacher> i'm trying to bind some behaviour to my content elements
[15:06:16] <kaputtmacher> my problem is the ajax loaded content seems to be not affected by my js
[15:06:27] <SirCmpwn> any ideas for animations on that site?
[15:06:57] <aeo> gnarf: Fair enough. Do you think it will be changed to error out instead of crashing?
[15:07:05] <donburks> SirCmpwn: Yes. The problem is that the hiddenContent class is getting added immediately. It doesn't wait for the fadeOut to complete before doing it.
[15:07:12] <kaputtmacher> some research on google make me understand that i need either delegate() or live() for future elements to become affected
[15:07:21] <donburks> If you want that to work, you will need to add the class changing to a callback function in fadeOut().
[15:07:41] <SirCmpwn> donburks: so fadeOut(original arguments here, function...)?
[15:07:47] <donburks> Correct.
[15:08:01] <kaputtmacher> now i stuck with some piece of code for cloning images and rendering them as grayscale -> this cloning does not happen for ajax loaded elements
[15:08:03] <donburks> And in that function, do your class setting.
[15:08:03] <SirCmpwn> within that function, how would I access the object that the fade is being applied to?
[15:08:04] <kaputtmacher> any hints?
[15:08:15] <donburks> $(this)
[15:08:19] <SirCmpwn> thanks
[15:08:24] <donburks> ?demo @ kaputtmacher
[15:08:25] <bot-t> kaputtmacher, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:08:48] <kaputtmacher> hmm i'll try :)
[15:09:55] <aeo> k, another bug: fx.elem.style['top'] = 'NaNpx'
[15:10:16] <aeo> This one definitely isn't me trying to animate a non-numeric property.
[15:10:27] <donburks> What generates the NaNpx string?
[15:10:35] <sunscreen> sorry for really dumb question but how do i convert #99999 to 0x??????
[15:10:44] <paul_irish> wat
[15:10:55] <donburks> If you are pulling a value directly from the CSS, it may contain the 'px' part already...which will eval as NaN.
[15:10:56] <aeo> donburks: call stack is update, step, t, custom, Anonymous Function, dequeue, ...
[15:10:56] <SirCmpwn> sunscreen: that's extremely vauge.
[15:11:01] <aeo> I'm looking for details.
[15:11:23] <aeo> donburks: I'm not doing anything, this call stack is jQuery top-to-bottom.
[15:11:26] <paul_irish> i imagine he wants to convert hex to octal?
[15:11:30] <SirCmpwn> ah!
[15:11:37] <SirCmpwn> donburks: could you have a look now?
[15:11:38] <donburks> SirCmpwn: Work?
[15:11:40] <donburks> Looking.
[15:11:41] <muay-guy> will this check if the string "/es/" is within currentPath var?? if ("currentPath:contains('/es/')") {}
[15:11:48] <sunscreen> i want the hex decimal value of the html color code ..which is just hex but i tried to do 0x99999 and the api i am using rejects them as valid colors
[15:12:07] <muay-guy> because for soem reason it always enters the loop, even when "/es/" is not inside the currentPath
[15:12:31] <donburks> SirCmpwn: Looks a lot better. :) However, you'll notice that your second animation is running on top of your first one.
[15:12:47] <SirCmpwn> it actually has a worse problem
[15:12:50] <donburks> If you want to delay that, you'll need to put the second animation inside the same callback function you just created.
[15:13:01] <paul_irish> sunscreen: pretty much all APIs expect hex colors as #RRGGBB
[15:13:02] <SirCmpwn> how to reproduce: refresh, click BatchDC, click AOF
[15:13:14] <aeo> donburks: jquery-1.6.2.js:8538. fx = {start: 0, end: NaN, now: NaN}
[15:14:07] <donburks> SirCmpwn: It's getting the CSS display param set to 'block' instead of 'inline'.
[15:14:42] <sunscreen> from 0xA50000 i get .. 13762560 is not a valid color string
[15:15:31] <SirCmpwn> donburks: I'm not sure on how to resolve this
[15:15:45] <aeo> hrm, I pass in top: NaN from somewhere; this may not be a jQuery bug, either
[15:17:00] <paul_irish> sunscreen: 0x is octal, bro.
[15:17:32] <kaputtmacher> donburks: here is an "demo" the problematic code is: http://pastebin.com/paMJxuVA
[15:17:36] <jaequery> is .forEach same as $.each ?
[15:17:39] <paul_irish> colors are hex. which you get by doing something like...  number.toString(16)
[15:17:42] <jaequery> performance wise?
[15:17:45] <donburks> SirCmpwn: In your fadeIn() at the end, add another callback with $(this).css('display', 'inline')
[15:17:52] <SirCmpwn> will do
[15:17:54] <paul_irish> jaequery: its faster but generally it doesnt matter
[15:18:02] <duellsy_> holy balls… 872 members in here
[15:18:02] <sunscreen> aha...
[15:18:03] <kaputtmacher> donburks: demo: http://dev.drasdos.com/category/projekte/
[15:18:14] <kaputtmacher> the first 6 images are fine
[15:18:16] <jaequery> yea i guess
[15:18:36] <kaputtmacher> but the rest doesn't work because of missing grayscale images
[15:18:42] <jaequery> i like jquery's $.each better for some reason
[15:19:14] <SirCmpwn> donburks: better, but still problematic
[15:19:36] <donburks> One sec to all: RL calls.
[15:19:52] <SirCmpwn> take your time
[15:21:29] <sunscreen> ah
[15:21:33] * sunscreen hits self with hammer
[15:22:00] <paul_irish> its cool bro
[15:22:24] <sunscreen> also it can be colors= { '#999999' - string  or 0xoctal - object }:
[15:25:20] <kaputtmacher> how can i bind an each function to future content loaded via ajax?
[15:26:05] <_newb> i'm loading into a div a JSON object, but it can't be found, even though i see it in the page source... any suggestions?
[15:26:07] <sunscreen> is there a quick dirty way to reverse an arrays order :D i got my gradient backwards now
[15:26:29] <sunscreen> dont want to have to copy and paste it to be the correct way round
[15:27:30] <vick> any photoshop ppl here? pm me I have a small gig
[15:27:58] <duellsy_> sunscreen: .reverse() ?
[15:28:13] <atrigent> hey guys, so I'm using jquery 1.6.2, and my understanding is that the .attr method is supposed to work as it did before (for accessing object properties), but it doesn't seem to be working for me
[15:29:09] <sunscreen> ya
[15:29:13] <sunscreen> y
[15:29:15] <sunscreen> :::)
[15:29:24] <duellsy_> _newb: it's because it's being loaded after query has done its business, perhaps checkout http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:29:29] <sunscreen> thank god there was 15 colors
[15:29:37] <sunscreen> it would of been a pain to shuffle them
[15:29:51] <duellsy_> haha yeah I'll bet!
[15:30:42] <atrigent> hmm actually maybe there's something else going on
[15:30:54] <_newb> duellsy_: so... jquery fills my div with a json object, that obj can't be addressed unless i tell the doc to always look for new elements?
[15:30:55] <atrigent> ok another question: why would .attr('nodeName') not work?
[15:30:56] <duellsy_> kaputtmacher: tried looking into .live() ? http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:31:10] <kaputtmacher> yes i did
[15:31:20] <kaputtmacher> but how can i combine live() and each()
[15:31:33] <kaputtmacher> i took a look at delegate as well
[15:31:37] <duellsy_> _newb: correct, otherwise it just doesn't know it exists yet
[15:32:11] <_newb> duellsy_: would i put the live() on the containing div?.. and tell it to parseJSON?
[15:32:34] <kaputtmacher> i have some js for creating a grayscale clone of an image, but this function is not called if content is dynamically loaded via ajax
[15:33:04] <duellsy_> _newb: give it a try
[15:33:04] <atrigent> actually scratch that
[15:33:17] <atrigent> the behavior of jQuery 1.4.4 is definitely different from that of 1.6.2
[15:34:20] <noob382> i am trying to get a dropdown box on right click
[15:34:34] <_newb> duellsy_: what event would you use?
[15:34:46] <noob382> http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/05/jquery-right-click-plugin/
[15:34:52] <noob382> would this be a good idea
[15:34:59] <noob382> or jquery ui has osmething
[15:35:00] <noob382> ?
[15:36:06] <duellsy_> _newb: hmmm try change
[15:36:24] <noob382> can anyone help me ?
[15:36:29] <atrigent> hey guys: http://jsfiddle.net/maX7y/
[15:36:30] <SirCmpwn> anyone else mind checking out http://astrodynamicstandards.com and playing around with the links on the left, and trying to see what causes the behavior on the second click of any link?
[15:36:41] <atrigent> try that, and then try changing the jquery version to 1.4.4
[15:36:44] <duellsy_> kaputtmacher: does the return have any javascript in it, or you just wanting your current js to use the ajax loaded data?
[15:36:46] <atrigent> notice different behavior
[15:37:07] <atrigent> why is the behavior different?
[15:37:37] <_newb> duellsy_: okay thanks
[15:37:56] <kaputtmacher> i duellsy_ i just want my js to process on the newly loaded data
[15:38:54] <duellsy_> kaputtmacher: ok, perhaps try just having a callback in your ajax function for the onsuccess, which will fire up your js?
[15:39:13] <kaputtmacher> http://pastebin.com/paMJxuVA <- this is the clone part
[15:40:35] <_newb> duellsy_: no luck.. i tried attaching a change and a click to my div, and am not seeing any results
[15:41:26] <kaputtmacher> duellsy_: i will check the callback option
[15:42:17] <duellsy_> _newb: perhaps parse your json in the onsuccess callback for your ajax load
[15:43:53] <_newb> duellsy_: so... fill the div with the html + json content, afterwards, try to address that json object by name, and parse it? .. suggestions how?
[15:44:02] <SirCmpwn> donburks: I got it working, thanks for your help
[15:44:20] <duellsy_> _newb: are you loading your content via an ajax call?
[15:44:22] <Aric> if i had id's "foo_1" through "foo_20" can i select all of them $("foo_") or some modification of that?
[15:44:35] <janthony> Is there a selector for select name, similar to input name? i.e. input[name='brand[]'] works, select[name='category[]'] doesn't work.
[15:44:39] <Aric> forgot a #
[15:45:04] <duellsy_> Aric: a guess, but try $("foo_*")
[15:45:18] <Aric> is it that easy huh :P
[15:45:25] <Aric> so easy i didnt try..
[15:45:32] <duellsy_> never tried it, purely a guess ;)
[15:46:57] <janthony> Anyone?
[15:47:11] <_newb> duellsy_: yes, i'm filling a div with [an image] [an image map] [a json object]
[15:47:26] <ravenzz> Aric http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[15:49:39] <Aric> $("[id^=foo_]") would be it then?
[15:50:05] <ravenzz> $('[id^="foo_"]')
[15:51:19] <janthony> No one knows?
[15:51:34] <ravenzz> janthony what?
[15:51:49] <janthony> Is there a selector for select name, similar to input name? i.e. input[name='brand[]'] works, select[name='category[]'] doesn't work.
[15:54:14] <duellsy_> _newb: ok, so perhaps do your parsing in the success part of the ajax call, like on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:54:26] <ravenzz> janthony of course, http://jsfiddle.net/mUcHb/
[15:54:30] <_newb> looking :)
[15:54:48] <duellsy_> cool
[15:55:03] <janthony> ravenzz: Thanks. For some reason, mine didn't work for me.
[15:55:25] <janthony> ravenzz: Maybe it's an issue with the .find()?
[15:55:33] <ravenzz> janthony quotes are mandatory
[15:55:50] <janthony> ahh, so I need to swap my quotes out?
[15:55:59] <janthony> replace my singles with doubles, doubles with singles
[15:56:48] <_newb> duellsy_: it says i can pass the argument datatype ("html": Returns HTML as plain text; included script tags are evaluated when inserted in the DOM. )
[15:57:03] <_newb> duellsy_: do you think that will leave my HTML as HTML and evaluate my JSON as JSON?
[15:57:24] <ravenzz> janthony doesn't matter which quotes, you need to quote both the selector and the value
[15:58:31] <duellsy_> _newb: should, if you have in there the script to also parse that json
[15:58:39] <janthony> ravenzz: Thanks, it's working. I had similar syntax, just a wrong selector before that one.
[15:59:39] <_newb> duellsy_: in the returned output? currently i just have: <script..>var obj = { ... }; eval(obj); </script>
[16:00:08] <duellsy_> _newb: seems like that should be ok
[16:03:39] <_newb> duellsy_: it's just saying it's not found... :(
[16:05:32] <_newb> duellsy_: thank you for the help... i haven't figured it out, but i gotta take off. i appreciate your time, man.
[16:05:42] <duellsy_> no worries, good luck!
[16:06:24] <tomasm-> im looking at the jquery version of tinymce... and am wondering... is it just a wrapper, or can i write plugins using jquery that integrate with it's domutils? i find it annoying that i have to pass nodes to editor.dom.something() rather than just have it be a part of the node class like jquery is so great at
[16:08:17] <abjorn> fuck the police
[16:10:48] <ggarri> hi people
[16:10:58] <abjorn> sup broski
[16:11:44] <ggarri> someone could ask me about if it is possible to change via jquery the current position of one element, for example top -10px and left -20px
[16:11:51] <ggarri> or whatever
[16:14:20] <tra> hmmm looks like jquery-ui has a little bug when closing a dialog with esc-button. the close function will be called every time i press esc again.
[16:14:32] <ajpiano> ggarri: hey man, how can i change the current position of one element by say, -10px on the top and -20px using jquery or whatever?
[16:15:33] <abjorn> satisfied, ggarri?
[16:16:08] <ggarri> hehe
[16:16:26] <ggarri> ok, I did quite bad the question
[16:16:50] <abjorn> yes, indeed, you did quite bad the question
[16:16:50] <ggarri> I'd want to change the current position of one img 10px more top
[16:17:17] <ajpiano> ggarri: .css("top", "-=10px");
[16:17:23] <ggarri> bt
[16:17:24] <ggarri> but
[16:17:39] <ggarri> I need to select the position as relative before
[16:17:42] <ggarri> is it ?
[16:17:50] <ggarri> does it?
[16:17:57] <ajpiano> yes
[16:17:58] <abjorn> wookiehangover: your twitter icon confuses me :(
[16:18:22] <ggarri> sorry
[16:19:09] <ggarri> is there other way to do that ?
[16:20:39] <fluxus> ggari: dynamically change the margin
[16:22:56] <d1rt> so I'm updating a few different elements using a [id*=meh] selector, and it's working for a few elements, but 1 of them doesn't update, I've dumped the result list to console to make sure it's selecting it an it is
[16:23:11] <ale> Hi, does anyone use Flot?
[16:23:21] <d1rt> when the selector results are dumped to console they show the element but it already has the class applied
[16:23:32] <d1rt> the UI doesn't show the element having said class
[16:23:47] <d1rt> but if I add the class manually it renders correctly.
[16:23:54] <t`owen> do textareas take values? can i if(textarea.val() == '')
[16:24:16] <d1rt> anyone ever experience jQuery updating the DOM but the UI failing to update?
[16:24:24] <ale> Is it possible to use eval with Flot? So that I can plot any given graph? Suck as x
[16:25:08] <snover> ?evil @ ale
[16:25:09] <bot-t> ale, $.deep | jQuery Plugins - $.deep provides two methods (depending on the number of arguments passed, either two or three) that set or get deeply nested properties of objects. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/deep
[16:25:12] <snover> oh ffs
[16:25:35] <ale> snover: sorry??
[16:25:45] <snover> ale: if you are using eval, you are doing it wrong.
[16:26:08] <ale> snover: I am not using anything, but I can't make Flot to graph anything
[16:26:25] <snover> if you are *asking* about using eval, you are doing it wrong
[16:26:49] <ale> snover: I mean about graphing with Flot plugin, do you know it?
[16:28:32] <ale> Does anyone know flot?
[16:29:50] <t`owen> My jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/timmyo/asyJ6/ - Those are propogating in reverse order (The error messages). I tried reversing their order in the script but it didn't do anything. Any takers?
[16:33:49] <t`owen> My jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/timmyo/asyJ6/ - Those are propogating in reverse order (The error messages). I tried reversing their order in the script but it didn't do anything. Any takers?
[16:34:11] <jaequery> any mootools devs in here?
[16:34:51] <donburks> t`owen: When you say 'propagating in reverse order' do you mean that you see the last one first?
[16:35:06] <t`owen> yes donburks
[16:35:37] <donburks> That's because you're overwriting whatever is in .error each time. You need to use .append() instead of .html()
[16:36:59] <ggarri> how could I get the width of one div ? using $(div).width ???
[16:37:21] <wookiehangover> if you target it with a class or id, yes
[16:37:31] <wookiehangover> $('#blah').width()
[16:37:33] <wookiehangover> ? width
[16:37:34] <bot-t> .width(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/width/
[16:38:27] <ggarri> but
[16:38:48] <ggarri> this obtained number is in px,em,... ?
[16:38:53] <t`owen> oh thanks donburks let me try that out
[16:39:08] <ggarri> because I have done that but the result is quite strange
[16:39:26] <ggarri> for example div has 400px and I got 673
[16:39:29] <wookiehangover> ggarri: it'll be a result in pixels
[16:39:42] <ggarri> I know
[16:39:47] <ggarri> but It strange
[16:39:53] <ggarri> but It's strange
[16:40:17] <ggarri> are there other ways to get it?
[16:41:04] <mwillhite> ggarri: the width() method won't necessarily be the css width
[16:41:13] <mwillhite> you would use .css('width') to get that
[16:41:36] <mwillhite> but that would mean you've specifically applied a width to that element
[16:41:40] <ggarri> ahhh
[16:41:41] <ggarri> ok
[16:41:42] <ggarri> thx
[16:43:27] <ale> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7154840/flot-customizable
[16:44:19] <ajpiano> thats one of those questions that's gonna get seriously downvoted
[16:45:49] <manuel_> i have a question about deferred style, i'm using deferreds for example to getJSON data, and then return $.when(dfd.promise()) so that i can immediately then() and fail() on the result
[16:45:50] <manuel_> https://gist.github.com/gists/1163937
[16:45:54] <manuel_> is that sensible?
[16:46:10] <manuel_> i mean it works great, but i'm not sure if i really got how to use the deferred object()
[16:46:56] <manuel_> i probably am going to miss the possibility of running deferreds in "parallel"
[16:47:06] <manuel_> with $.when(promise1(), promise2())
[16:48:28] <ajpiano> manuel_: ajax is an implementation of deferred
[16:48:38] <ajpiano> you can just do return $.ajax()
[16:48:48] <ajpiano> function foo () { return $.ajax() }
[16:48:53] <ajpiano> $.when( foo() );
[16:48:56] <manuel_> i do some parsing of the json results before resolving
[16:49:03] <ajpiano> ah
[16:49:06] <manuel_> so i need my own deferred
[16:49:06] <min|dvir|us> Hi. In http://min.dvir.us, sizeToWindow() pads the bottom of the page just enough so that #contact gets to the top of the page. It is called onresize and onDOM; however, it only functions properly onDOM. Any thoughts? Script is here: http://min.dvir.us/site_media/static/style/blue/scroll.js
[16:49:14] <manuel_> i check for json.status == "success"
[16:49:24] <noob382> can anyone check what is wrong int his
[16:49:27] <ajpiano> i think the callbacks directly defined in options get called back before stuff that's late binded via .then
[16:49:28] <noob382> http://jsfiddle.net/Dxsuq/
[16:49:32] <noob382> i am trying to add a column
[16:49:36] <noob382> to a table
[16:49:53] <manuel_> ajpiano: i want to fail() when the status is "error", would that be possible? i think i need a "wrapping" deferred
[16:50:06] <manuel_> i'm a bit braindead after coding for 12 hours though
[16:50:09] <manuel_> maybe i just need a bit of rest
[16:50:13] <ajpiano> manuel_: then yeah, you're right, the wrapping deferred is probably necessary
[16:50:32] <manuel_> my question is mostly, should i return dfd.promise(), or is return $.when(dfd.promise()); ok
[16:50:38] <ajpiano> the return $.when( dfd.promise()) doesn't manke sense
[16:50:38] <ajpiano> yeah
[16:50:42] <ajpiano> just do return dfd.promise();
[16:50:42] * manuel_ takes a peak at the source of $.ajax
[16:50:52] <manuel_> can i call then and fail on dfd.promise?
[16:51:08] <ajpiano> yes
[16:51:40] <mwillhite> noob382 Uncaught ReferenceError: addColumn is not defined
[16:51:43] <ajpiano> the point of the promise is to have an interface to the deferrred but that you can't actually .resolve() or reject() from outside
[16:51:53] <min|dvir|us> Can anyone see the problem?
[16:52:20] <noob382> undefined in the sense mwillhie
[16:52:23] <mwillhite> you may have a syntax error somewhere or something that prevents it from being loaded by jsfiddle
[16:52:28] <noob382> i have defined it in the button
[16:52:42] <mwillhite> I'm just reporting what the js inspector is saying
[16:53:14] <mwillhite> typically you don't want to use the onclick attribute unless you have a very good reason
[16:53:33] <mwillhite> is there something that prevents you from using jquery here?
[16:53:43] <mwillhite> it seems like that would be much easier
[16:54:11] <noob382> no
[16:54:27] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano, sorry to highlight you, but I know you know your stuff, and this is a tough problem to debug. Do you mind taking a look?
[16:54:36] <noob382> can you point me to jquery example if you can
[16:55:25] <mwillhite> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1075415/jquery-add-html-table-column
[16:55:35] <mwillhite> I'm sure there are many resources if you google the question
[16:55:38] <noob382> hehe
[16:55:43] <noob382> i did that already
[16:55:54] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, sorry i'm about to roll, one of my best friends bday
[16:56:04] <min|dvir|us> All good, yo homie.

[17:03:33] <jaypitidi> I have an ajax navigation and when I make an ajax call it will show my preloader until the page is finished loading. The sequence in which it works is a user clicks a link - when the address changes i inject my preloader in the html - I call .load() method to get the requested content - I call .hide() to hide the old content - I call .fadeIn() to show the new content. Now this works fine when I
[17:04:19] <jaypitidi> use standard animations. but if I were to scale the div, it will apply all of those animations to my preloader, is there anyway I can omit my preloader from these animations?
[17:04:30] <manuel_> ajpiano: jesus you're right, dunno what i was thinking, thanks!
[17:06:03] <mwillhite> jaypitidi: take a look at .not() when you are selecting elements

[18:01:53] <liquidcms> and i want to reassign b.innerHTML to the value of this filter function
[18:02:09] <manuel_> there's something i don't understand here
[18:02:10] <manuel_> http://pastie.org/2414349
[18:02:17] <manuel_> why does the first one return only the first pre?
[18:02:27] <coldhead> $('p', b).yourStuffHere(), liquidcms
[18:02:44] <coldhead> or possibly $(b).find('p').doStuff();
[18:02:46] <liquidcms> hmm.. ok.. that looks cool
[18:02:54] <coldhead> you shouldn't need to use innerHTML if you're using jQuery
[18:02:54] <liquidcms> the function is actually this: return $.trim($(this).html()) == ''; }).remove();
[18:02:59] <coldhead> ?html @ liquidcms
[18:02:59] <bot-t> liquidcms, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[18:03:09] <coldhead> bah stupid bot
[18:03:14] <coldhead> it's a setter as well as a getter
[18:03:46] <liquidcms> so is this "b" in my context?
[18:04:25] <liquidcms> and no assignment.. just the $('p', b)
[18:04:30] <liquidcms> lemme try
[18:05:52] <manuel_> dunno if my last message got posted before i disconnected?
[18:06:01] <manuel_> http://pastie.org/2414349 <- why does the first expression only return one pre?
[18:07:05] <liquidcms> yea, $('p', b) isnt it
[18:07:18] <liquidcms> but still.. maybe its the this within the function
[18:07:49] <coldhead> ?p @ liquidcms
[18:07:50] <bot-t> liquidcms, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:07:59] <coldhead> show us what you're doing and we'll make it better
[18:08:04] <coldhead> then we'll go out for icecream
[18:08:30] <liquidcms> http://pastebin.com/T7ycYnm3
[18:08:57] <misterm> manuel_: beacuse there's only one pre in the jQuery object
[18:09:18] <manuel_> but why does the second one return two then?
[18:09:35] <liquidcms> oops.. typo http://pastebin.com/4Yq0i0Qj
[18:09:36] <manuel_> the doc says it should return two
[18:10:00] <coldhead> that looks good liquidcms
[18:10:16] <liquidcms> testing now
[18:10:59] <liquidcms> lol.. well.  i guess closer
[18:11:16] <liquidcms> it doesnt cause errors or replace my content with object [object]
[18:11:28] <liquidcms> but doesnt do anything.. which might actually be close
[18:12:21] <liquidcms> hmm.. ok.. might need to tweak a little
[18:12:33] <coldhead> liquidcms: http://jsfiddle.net/LRskt/
[18:12:36] <liquidcms> function is to remove empty P tags
[18:12:48] <liquidcms> but Tinymce is adding nbsp
[18:12:53] <coldhead> there i have it changing the colour of empty tags
[18:12:59] <coldhead> to demo it
[18:13:03] <coldhead> but it works with remove
[18:13:10] <coldhead> hmm maybe try ?text
[18:13:18] <coldhead> instead of ?html
[18:13:22] <coldhead> ?text
[18:13:22] <bot-t> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[18:13:58] <coldhead> liquidcms: http://jsfiddle.net/LRskt/1/
[18:14:01] <liquidcms> ahh.. thats cool
[18:15:33] <liquidcms> great .. i think this means it works.. but that i have to filter out nbsp as well... likely
[18:15:45] <liquidcms> thanks for your help!! :)
[18:17:10] <coldhead> ?eval $('&nbsp').text() === '';
[18:17:10] <bot-t> coldhead: true

[18:31:04] <LeoJweda> Can I ask jqueryui questions here?
[18:31:17] * LeoJweda hopes that that wasn't "asking to ask"
[18:31:52] <coldhead> go ahead
[18:31:52] <misterm> LeoJweda: yes
[18:32:09] <coldhead> asking to ask is okay
[18:32:13] <coldhead> it just ages every one
[18:32:52] <LeoJweda> is there any style I can apply to the body to give it the same look and feel as the rest of jquery stuff?
[18:33:34] <misterm> LeoJweda: sure, if you inspect the elements in your UI widgets, you'll see what classes they use and you can use those in your own elements
[18:34:15] <LeoJweda> misterm: i was thinking of applying .ui-widget to it but I'm not sure if that's ok
[18:41:21] <multipass> how can i check if a file type input has a file selected?
[18:46:17] <ale> Does anyone use flot plugin?
[18:47:24] <coldhead> i think snover has used that, ale
[18:47:34] <snover> thanks coldhead.
[18:47:41] <coldhead> you should definitely PM him about it
[18:55:25] <Krittick> Couple of quick questions: Are there any video chat APIs that work well with jQuery? I've been using OpenTok and it's not bad but jQuery support is low in activity. Also, any realtime text chat apps / plugins / apis that work well with jQuery?
[18:56:21] <snover> coldhead: you owe me an HJ.
[18:57:17] <snover> ?jqisjs @ Krittick
[18:57:17] <bot-t> Krittick, ?jquery-version
[18:57:22] <snover> what is wrong with you bot-t
[18:57:22] <bot-t> snover, Yes.
[18:58:01] <gnarf> ?jsisjs
[18:58:01] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[18:58:11] <snover> gnarf: they used to be aliased together
[18:58:26] <gnarf> ?jqisjs
[18:58:26] <bot-t> jsisjs
[18:58:29] <gnarf> :)
[18:59:12] <multipass> how can i check if a file type input has a file selected? im having trouble iwth .val == ""
[18:59:28] <ale> snover: can you help me with flot?
[19:00:00] <Krittick> I know this. I'm asking specifically for something that is known to work well with jQuery itself (ie, has a jquery plugin). Mainly for quick changes and feature additions that could be done quicker than raw JS.
[19:00:12] <snover> ale: snover helps those who help themselves with google & trying shit first.
[19:00:22] <snover> ?nopm @ ale
[19:00:22] <bot-t> ale, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[19:00:47] <ale> snover: haha okey, but I looked for what I need and I can't find what I am looking for
[19:01:29] <LeoJweda> Hmmmm… Is ui-widget really the best thing there is to apply to body?
[19:01:34] <LeoJweda> *best class
[19:01:49] <ale> snover: I want to do a math function plotter, is this possible with flot?
[19:08:59] <ale> snover: I know it is possible, but how can let the user plot any equation? I am just asking that, will you answer me?
[19:13:27] <ggarri> guys
[19:13:46] <ggarri> how I can get the 3 first elements of one vector ???
[19:16:27] <coldhead> snover: copy that good buddy
[19:16:32] <coldhead> roger niner
[19:35:53] <Rinthe> <a href="" class="zoom"></a> if (e.which === 76) { e.preventDefault();$('.zoom').click(); } why doesn't this work?
[19:35:59] <Rinthe> when i push the key
[19:42:53] <Rinthe> how do i get href? i tried .attr('href') but it's not working
[19:44:48] <coldhead> that is how you get it
[19:44:57] <coldhead> you may be operating on the wrong element
[19:45:20] <coldhead> ?eval $('<a href="Rinthe">lol</a>').attr('href');
[19:45:21] <bot-t> coldhead: TypeError: div is undefined
[19:45:28] <coldhead> WOOPS!
[19:46:06] <LeoJweda> is it ok to use ui-widget on body to set the font and other style stuff?
[20:06:51] <jfelchner> Ok, this seems weird.  I want to animate the width of an element but I do NOT want it to set display: none.  I just want it to leave it with a width of 0.  However using 'toggle' does this automatically.  How can I get 'toggle' functionality without display being set to 'none'?
[20:07:13] <jfelchner> I've tried to do it manually but the problem I'm running into is that the original full width value gets lost after the first time I resize it down to 0px.
[20:09:07] <Rinthe> coldhead: i got it thanks!
[20:09:46] <coldhead> good work, babe
[20:10:09] <coldhead> now get yourself some icecream
[20:10:45] <Rinthe> lol
[20:10:52] <jfelchner> Also, setting css('width', 'auto') restores it properly but doesn't animate it.
[20:11:25] <Rinthe> coldhead: after i get the url, how can i make that image show up in the current window?
[20:13:04] <coldhead> $('body').html('<img src="' + href + '" />')
[20:22:44] <coldhead> i wonder if anyone will ever do a tool tip plugin for jQuery
[20:23:32] <SirCmpwn> http://flowplayer.org/tools/tooltip/index.html
[20:23:45] <SirCmpwn> http://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+tooltip+plugin
[20:24:31] <miketaylr> coldhead: i feel like jquery needs to mature a little more before that could ever be successful
[20:25:16] <miketaylr> hell, i'm not even sure that javascript is up to the job
[20:25:30] <miketaylr> look into java applets
[20:27:08] <SirCmpwn> this one looks nice: http://jquery.bassistance.de/tooltip/demo/
[20:28:17] <coldhead> miketaylr: i think java applets might be too "heavy"
[20:28:28] <miketaylr> hmm
[20:28:32] <coldhead> i am considering flash
[20:28:42] <miketaylr> i've heard there's a "flash lite"
[20:28:44] <miketaylr> that might work
[20:28:48] <coldhead> i'm a little surprised no one has done any in jQuery yet
[20:28:59] <coldhead> maybe there isn't a market
[20:29:02] <coldhead> i guess i won't bother
[20:30:07] <bizkuick> coldhead: Any of what in jQuery?
[20:30:57] <coldhead> tooltips
[20:31:07] <coldhead> tooltip plugins
[20:31:10] <coldhead> or tooltips in core
[20:31:27] <coldhead> you know when you hover over an element and you see a popup?
[20:31:32] <coldhead> and a chime plays?
[20:31:58] <bizkuick> I see. And you mean in jQuery core instead of jQuery UI then?
[20:32:14] <coldhead> yeah
[20:32:21] <coldhead> jQuery UI is too heavy
[20:32:44] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[20:39:53] <bizkuick> coldhead: I have a very basic tooltip done in jQuery core. But it's totally up to you if you want a look at it. It's not robust by any means, but it takes window position into account.
[20:40:25] <endra> Hello everyone
[20:41:39] <coldhead> bizkuick: my manager is already getting one done in flash :(
[20:41:41] <coldhead> thanks anyway
[20:41:54] <bizkuick> That's silly.
[20:42:06] <bizkuick> Oh well.
[20:43:11] <endra> I have a question regarding jquery-ui/autocomplete. A bit of background first: I am implementing a function that will allow the user to type and autocomplete the name of a city. The problem: the server requires an ID, not the name of the city. The basic solution I want to do: append _autocomplete to the name of the text field and generate a hidden input field with the original name. Then
[20:43:12] <endra> autocomplete should set the label to that of the text field, and the value (id) to that of the hidden field. I got it mostly working: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=9wCJT9QY
[20:44:03] <endra> My only problem is that it keeps writing the id/value in the text field (e.g. 1) instead of the city name.
[20:44:14] <endra> Everything else works fine. Is there a way I can overwrite this behavior?
[20:45:12] <gnarf> endra: so
[20:45:30] <gnarf> endra: First of all, let me just mention that not all your users will be using javascript
[20:45:52] <gnarf> so, if you could make the server side parse the actual city name anyway it would probably work better
[20:45:59] <gnarf> however, what you want to do is not impossible
[20:46:03] <SirCmpwn> while I agree that this should be handled server side
[20:46:16] <SirCmpwn> assuming that your users will not be using javascript will drive you crazy
[20:46:37] <gnarf> if you are using a custom data source, you can pass extra data, and that data will be in the "ui" parameter of the "select" event
[20:47:46] <endra> gnarf: the ui value is correct (the selected item). ui.item.label is 'Ottawa' and ui.item.value is '1'. The input hidden is given the correct value (via $('#' + input_hidden_id).val(ui.item.value)) but the text remains, for some reason, '1'
[20:48:17] <ale> Is there any library such as eval() which is able to handle functions such as x^5
[20:48:24] <gnarf> use "Ottowa" as the value as well, and pass an "id" down the pipe in the item
[20:50:21] <endra> okay, I'll try that
[20:50:32] <ale> Is there any library such as eval() which is able to handle functions such as x^5?
[20:50:57] <gnarf> endra: https://gist.github.com/abb125667e97406e32da
[20:51:10] <gnarf> endra: that is just some code i use to make a "tagger"
[20:51:17] <gnarf> which uses a hidden etc
[20:53:17] <endra> I fixed the issue with your recommendation of using label/value as the name and passing an 'id' along with them.
[20:54:19] <gnarf> coo
[20:54:22] <endra> gnarf: thanks for the help. Looking at your link now
[20:56:44] <endra> Regarding people not using javascript.. what is the reason for that? How many of them are there? Any of you received complaints from them?
[20:57:43] <bizkuick> endra: I've heard numbers as high as 5% before.
[20:58:08] <Rinthe> imgURL.push($('.zoom').attr('href')); if there are 3 '.zoom' how can i store all the URL into an array?
[20:58:45] <da-beginner> hi guys.. what do you guys think about jquery certification? is it of any value?
[21:00:29] <bizkuick> Rinthe: $('.zoom').each(function() { imgURL.push($(this).attr('href')); }); // Probably
[21:00:31] <endra> da-beginner: I would say it would be more interesting to a potential employer to see your portfolio than it is to see that you are jquery certified. Put one of your websites on display and mention how you used jquery to solve a problem or something of the sort
[21:00:36] <SirCmpwn> where I work, I just told them that I knew how to use jquery, and they believed me after a few websites worth of using it.
[21:01:45] <Rinthe> bizkuick: im inside $('.zoom').click(function() {
[21:02:07] <da-beginner> thanks guys
[21:02:12] <Rinthe> or do i have to do it outside of it?
[21:02:44] <bizkuick> Rinthe: Probably need some more context.
[21:03:14] <Rinthe> bizkuick: sorry, http://codepad.org/8mtmedED
[21:03:21] <Rinthe> nothing is showing up
[21:04:42] <bizkuick> Desired behavior would be to what, show the current clicked ".zoom" object?
[21:05:14] <Rinthe> to show one of them
[21:05:21] <bizkuick> Any one of them?
[21:05:24] <Rinthe> i have to check against the URL hash tag
[21:05:43] <Rinthe> to see which one to show
[21:07:34] <Rinthe> bizkuick: doesn't look like $('.zoom').each(function() { imgURL.push($(this).attr('href')); }); is working hmm
[21:08:07] <bizkuick> Rinthe: Yeah, because that was an answer to a question that didn't address your problem. :P
[21:08:31] <SirCmpwn> is there a way of taking any element of a web page and moving it all the way to the <body> tag, then positioning it absolutely, such that you could almost "detach" an element from its parent and move it freely?
[21:08:35] <Rinthe> bizkuick oh haha
[21:09:02] <bizkuick> Rinthe: So what is being stored in the URL hash tag then?
[21:09:21] <Rinthe> #1, #2, #3 etc
[21:10:23] <bizkuick> Rinthe: Are the individual '.zoom' objects each references to images. You're saying there is 3 of them, is it not possible to just reference them as a "this" inside the click function?
[21:10:55] <Rinthe> im using an index. for each image, theres a zoom
[21:10:59] <Rinthe> and they're in teh same order
[21:11:17] <bizkuick> Are the '.zoom' sibling elements to one another?
[21:11:28] <Rinthe> no they're not
[21:11:34] <Rinthe> the .zooms are with the image
[21:11:40] <Rinthe> it's own image
[21:14:09] <bizkuick> Rinthe: Was the alert in this snippit reporting the correct href that you're looking for?
[21:14:22] <Rinthe> withw hat you gave me?
[21:14:32] <bizkuick> Rinthe: Either.
[21:14:34] <Rinthe> nothing alters with what u gave me
[21:14:35] <Rinthe> before
[21:14:42] <Rinthe> it showed 3 alerts
[21:15:02] <Rinthe> but i think it made it click on each .zoom
[21:15:08] <Rinthe> im using a hotkey to activate the click
[21:19:03] <bizkuick> Rinthe: http://codepad.org/guox8wzH Give this a shot.
[21:21:04] <Rinthe> bizkuick: k hold up
[21:22:40] <Rinthe> bizkuick: no luck. http://codepad.org/ipGgrA52
[21:23:44] <Rinthe> i think my new if else is messing things up haha
[21:24:07] <bizkuick> I doubt it, I'm sure I probably haven't gauged your use case.
[21:25:38] <Rinthe> $('.zoom').each(function() { imgURL.push($(this).attr('href')); }); isn't putting the URL into imgURL for some reason
[21:25:48] <Rinthe> i tried to alert(imgURL[0]) nothing
[21:28:15] <bizkuick> Rinthe: It should be populated unless at the time that selector is going off, there is no DOM elements with the 'zoom' class name.
[21:28:20] <min|dvir|us> !(next == null || next.is(current)) || (next == null && current != null) -- simplify!
[21:29:31] <Rinthe> .zoom is hidden btw
[21:29:50] <Rinthe> does that change anything
[21:29:56] <Rinthe> display: none on .zoom
[21:30:20] <bizkuick> Rinthe: Not really. Give this a try, I want to see if you're just overcomplicating the matter. http://codepad.org/LoyS5OcJ
[21:31:57] <Rinthe> well if there is one image it shows up
[21:32:04] <Rinthe> if more than one it'll show up on top of each other
[21:41:45] <Rinthe> bizkuick: http://codepad.org/lnOopblR any idea something this simple isn't working? nothing happens when i click them
[21:43:52] <bizkuick> Rinthe: Probably related to the same problem. You said there's multiple of them at the same time right?
[21:45:10] <Rinthe> bizkuick: some pages have multiple images, some only have one. i'm testing this at single image pages right now
[21:45:19] <Rinthe> bizkuick: but they're still not working
[21:45:34] <bizkuick> Rinthe: I have a feeling since there's multiple at the same time, we have multiple ID conflicts, which browsers don't play nicely with.
[21:45:54] <bizkuick> Since IDs should be unique.
[21:46:10] <Rinthe> let me change them to classes then
[21:47:29] <newbie001> hey there
[21:47:50] <newbie001> can somebody help me on how to change the value of $(this) on a function?
[21:48:07] <Rinthe> bizkuick: that fixed my problem with this bit: http://codepad.org/w920Zn3e but when i click on the iamge or the overlay, they still do nothing
[21:51:05] <Rinthe> bizkuick: ok on pages with multiple images. it's only showing the image from the last .zoom
[21:51:24] <bizkuick> Rinthe: Is there any way I can see these pages?
[21:51:41] <Rinthe> can i pm u
[21:51:45] <bizkuick> Yes.
[21:52:18] <bizkuick> Nice comments. :P
[21:52:22] <bizkuick> Let me see what's up.
[21:53:28] <danieliser> does using live on an event function mean it automatically initializes on new content?
[21:56:52] <danheberden> danieliser in a general sense.. it captures the event when it bubbles up to the document, and checks what kind of element it is
[21:57:23] <danheberden> it uses event delegation
[21:57:51] <danheberden> you could also, and probably more efficiently use ?delegate
[21:57:51] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[21:58:44] <coldhead> ask better questions
[22:01:13] <ale> I have <div id="users"> <p id="user1">User 1</p> <p id="user2">User 2</p> <p id="user1">User 1</p> </div>  .. How can I check if there is a duplicate and then delete it? In this case the duplicate would be user 1
[22:04:41] <ale> I have <div id="users"> <p id="user1">User 1</p> <p id="user2">User 2</p> <p id="user1">User 1</p> </div>  .. How can I check if there is a duplicate and then delete it? In this case the duplicate would be user 1
[22:06:24] <coldhead> that won't work because IDs must be unique
[22:06:45] <coldhead> if they were classes you could test if $('.user1').length > 1
[22:08:38] <min|dvir|us> http://min.dvir.us/site_media/static/style/blue/scroll.js -- yes.
[22:09:02] <newbie001> how can one modify the $(this) obj inside a function?  $(this) = $(this).next(); doesnt work
[22:09:57] <min|dvir|us> newbie001, there are many things wrong with your conceptions.
[22:10:11] <min|dvir|us> First of all, you shouldn't overwrite this like that.
[22:10:38] <min|dvir|us> You can't possibly have a reason to change this if you try to assign to $(this).
[22:11:04] <min|dvir|us> (But there are good reasons, mind you; accomplish by using .call().)
[22:11:13] <min|dvir|us> newbie001, You can't assign to $(whatever).
[22:11:32] <min|dvir|us> $ is actually a function. You're passing whatever as the first argument to that function.
[22:11:37] <min|dvir|us> It's not magic.
[22:11:54] <newbie001> i want to given an input parameter, show it than increment to the next which is the next div
[22:12:22] <min|dvir|us> newbie001, now rewrite your question as if I was your mother.
[22:12:40] <newbie001> ok sorry
[22:12:51] <min|dvir|us> That's fine. Part of learning is learning how to ask. :)
[22:13:22] <newbie001> i am doing a slideshow that if one certain div has children it shows and arrow do jump between the children
[22:13:36] <newbie001> then i changed it to a function so that i could do less code
[22:13:50] <SirCmpwn> how to ask a question: think about what you want, and write down your question.  Then supply as many details as possible.  Then add grammer.  You'll be liked much more, and get your question answered.
[22:14:08] <newbie001> jQuery.fn.shownext = function() {
[22:14:10] <min|dvir|us> Makes total sense. Add a variable called current.
[22:14:21] <min|dvir|us> And you should definitely not add it as a jQuery function.
[22:14:23] <coldhead> mmm currants
[22:14:35] <min|dvir|us> function showNext() { blah; }
[22:15:04] <min|dvir|us> Which you should be doing inside a module, but it's OK for now.
[22:15:37] <newbie001> and the blah is the input parameter right?
[22:15:48] <min|dvir|us> newbie001, I don't know what showNext() looks like.
[22:15:55] <min|dvir|us> You write showNext().
[22:16:09] <min|dvir|us> I'm just saying, don't make it a jQuery function.
[22:16:11] <min|dvir|us> That is abuse.
[22:17:11] <newbie001> ok gonna try that thnx
[22:18:52] <min|dvir|us> Weird bug: http://min.dvir.us -- on IE7 and IE8, #current-h2 is 1px too high, as evidenced by the fact that the blue border-top is invisible. IE9, FF, Chrome load it fine.
[22:19:26] <ndss56> how to insert <p class="foo"></p> in <div></div> without deleting stuff in div?
[22:19:41] <min|dvir|us> ndss56, appendTo.
[22:19:49] <ndss56> thanks
[22:19:57] <min|dvir|us> Or prependTo, depending on to the beginning or end.
[22:20:09] <min|dvir|us> Or prepend or append, depending on what's easier.
[22:20:54] <ndss56> yeah just reading now... not sure whats the diff between append and appendTO
[22:21:09] <min|dvir|us> a.appendTo(b) <==> b.append(a).
[22:21:52] <danheberden> proof that the shortest distance between a and b, is min|dvir|us
[22:22:23] <ndss56> basically the same thing
[22:22:25] <ndss56> cheers
[22:23:39] <min|dvir|us> danheberden, I should tell employers that.
[22:24:23] <min|dvir|us> "The shortest distance between a and b is me." "Hired!"
[22:24:33] <danheberden> haha DO IT
[22:27:07] <min|dvir|us> Does anyone have Opera?
[22:27:14] <seancurtis> yes
[22:27:35] <seancurtis> real question you should be asking however is "Why don't I have Opera?"
[22:28:39] <min|dvir|us> seancurtis, I asked that momentarily after I asked the channel.
[22:28:41] <min|dvir|us> I just got it.
[22:28:47] <SirCmpwn> I have Opera, but I only open it about once a month to make sure my websites work with it
[22:29:19] <endra> Is there an event for jquery-ui-autocomplete for when the user types something but does not select from the list? Is there a way to detect that type of change?
[22:29:43] <seancurtis> Opera is a decent browser - never really have any problems with stuff not displaying correctly in it
[22:29:57] <SirCmpwn> seancurtis: my company makes me test on every major browser
[22:30:11] <seancurtis> Opera is a major browser for your company?
[22:30:22] <seancurtis> what % of your users use it?
[22:31:19] <seancurtis> SirCmpwn: define "major browser" - major in the US? major in Asia?
[22:31:58] <SirCmpwn>  We test on IE 6&7 (it only needs to show the content, it doesn't need to look good), and it needs to look good on IE8+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera
[22:32:45] <min|dvir|us> What company?
[22:33:08] <SirCmpwn> dsoft technology
[22:33:23] <SirCmpwn> don't look us up, the website is horrible and they won't let me redesign it
[22:33:28] <SirCmpwn> here's a website I made for them: http://dsoft-cms.com/
[22:33:42] <min|dvir|us> I just looked you up, and it is disgusting.
[22:33:56] <SirCmpwn> it is horrendous, and I've mentioned this several times
[22:34:21] <min|dvir|us> SirCmpwn, your website looks good but it's got a few bugs.
[22:34:29] <SirCmpwn> min|dvir|us: care to point them out?
[22:34:46] <min|dvir|us> READ MORE covers up some text.
[22:35:03] <endra> SirCmpwn: which langauge is your cms written in
[22:35:16] <SirCmpwn> endra: it's based on Umbraco, which is ASP.NET with C#
[22:35:20] <min|dvir|us> The social networking buttons on the top next to the search bar don't seem to be aligned right.
[22:35:21] <SirCmpwn> min|dvir|us: which read more link?
[22:35:29] <min|dvir|us> Middle one.
[22:35:56] <SirCmpwn> browser/OS?
[22:36:15] <min|dvir|us> Opera on Windows 7.
[22:36:35] <SirCmpwn> does it end with a link whose text is "Umbraco CMS"?
[22:36:52] <newbie001> min|dvir|us:  got it working tnhx !
[22:36:52] <min|dvir|us> Yse.
[22:36:54] <min|dvir|us> *Yes.
[22:37:02] <min|dvir|us> newbie001, great!
[22:37:15] <SirCmpwn> that's the right place for it to end, it just needs a period
[22:37:29] <danheberden> twss
[22:37:42] <SirCmpwn> a period that it now has
[22:37:44] <min|dvir|us> SirCmpwn, the READ MORE link is on top of the Umbarco CMS link.
[22:37:56] <min|dvir|us> Hides it.
[22:38:03] <SirCmpwn> x.x
[22:38:04] <SirCmpwn> damn
[22:38:05] <min|dvir|us> Looks much better in FF.
[22:38:16] <SirCmpwn> I'm in linux atm, so Opera isn't going to happen
[22:38:26] <SirCmpwn> I'll look into it next time I'm in Windows
[22:38:42] <SirCmpwn> what other problems do you notice?
[22:39:18] <min|dvir|us> When you hover over the navbar links under the search bar, they look good, but the whitish vertical lines separating them piss me off because they're too short.
[22:39:57] <SirCmpwn> that one isn't a quick fix
[22:40:06] <SirCmpwn> but I'll look into it
[22:40:26] <min|dvir|us> Really?
[22:40:40] <SirCmpwn> I don't have server access from home
[22:40:48] <SirCmpwn> I just have access to the CMS backend
[22:41:03] <Spinkzeit> Would it be a bad idea putting a function inside $('*').change()? (Like would that chew away at the clients memory etc?)
[22:41:07] <min|dvir|us> SirCmpwn, #mainNavigation li a { display: block }.
[22:41:10] <SirCmpwn> and that particular image isn't controlled by the CMS
[22:41:21] <SirCmpwn> I feel like that's going to be a bad idea
[22:41:23] <SirCmpwn> but I'll try it
[22:41:29] <min|dvir|us> Definitely not.
[22:41:36] <min|dvir|us> It will make a take up its container.
[22:41:54] <SirCmpwn> wait, they already are display: block
[22:42:14] <SirCmpwn> oh, the image on either side is part of the background, which is a fixed size image
[22:42:35] <SirCmpwn> anyway, we use ClientDependency, so I'd need server access to change the CSS
[22:43:00] <min|dvir|us> You're right, they are.
[22:43:05] <min|dvir|us> SirCmpwn, "line-height: 1.2307em;"
[22:43:07] <min|dvir|us> Explain this please.
[22:43:15] <min|dvir|us> It better be good.
[22:43:35] <SirCmpwn> we were told to be compliant with every standard under the sun
[22:43:46] <SirCmpwn> using em sizes is better for accessibility
[22:43:51] <min|dvir|us> em is correct.
[22:43:56] <min|dvir|us> I'm talking about 1.2307.
[22:44:01] <min|dvir|us> Why that particular value?
[22:44:13] <SirCmpwn> where is it found?
[22:44:37] <min|dvir|us> http://www.dsoft-cms.com/DependencyHandler.axd?s=L2Nzcy9jb21tb24uY3NzOy9jc3MvaG9tZXBhZ2UuY3NzOy9jc3MvcHJpbnQuY3NzOw%3d%3d&t=Css&cdv=1015
[22:44:43] <courpse> .toggle() just changes visibility to hidden right?
[22:44:57] <min|dvir|us> #mainNavigation li
[22:45:07] <min|dvir|us> courpse, or back to showing.
[22:45:15] * courpse nods.
[22:45:18] <min|dvir|us> It does so by doing display: none.
[22:45:21] <SirCmpwn> no idea, I didn't make that one
[22:45:26] <SirCmpwn> and it is on #search
[22:45:45] <min|dvir|us> Which means that the element will disappear and whatever area it occupied will now be available for other elements.
[22:45:53] <SirCmpwn> it shouldn't be there, you're right
[22:46:02] <SirCmpwn> would you like to see the unobsfucated css?
[22:46:10] <min|dvir|us> No.
[22:46:13] <courpse> now, if i do $('.class').toggle(), if any classes called .class are inside a class called .class, they will do nothing if the first gets triggered?
[22:46:29] <SirCmpwn> s/obsfucated/minified
[22:46:44] <min|dvir|us> SirCmpwn, IDs are to be named-like-this.
[22:47:07] <min|dvir|us> courpse, there is only one class called .class.
[22:47:12] <min|dvir|us> (.class.)
[22:47:18] <courpse> What?
[22:47:29] <min|dvir|us> Many elements could be of class .class.
[22:47:33] <min|dvir|us> But there is only one class .class.
[22:47:53] <SirCmpwn> min|dvir|us: this really isn't relevant in the slightest.  in any case, I didn't name that div
[22:47:56] <courpse> I'm sure you understood me just fine.
[22:48:10] <min|dvir|us> courpse, do you want to be right?
[22:48:23] <courpse> :/
[22:48:26] <min|dvir|us> SirCmpwn, I am so sorry.
[22:48:35] <courpse> If its too much hassle for you to answer the question, don't bother, :/
[22:49:01] <SirCmpwn> min|dvir|us: what for?
[22:49:02] <min|dvir|us> I don't understand the question -- particularly after the comma.
[22:49:12] <min|dvir|us> SirCmpwn, sarcasm.
[22:49:15] <SirCmpwn> ah
[22:49:20] <courpse> now, if i do $('.class').toggle(), if any elements with classes called .class are inside an element with class called .class, they will do nothing if the first gets triggered?
[22:49:29] <SirCmpwn> if you really want to see some bad web coding, take another look at http://dsoft-tech.com/
[22:49:36] <SirCmpwn> really dig into the source there
[22:49:41] <SirCmpwn> especially the Technologies page
[22:49:50] <min|dvir|us> courpse, "they will do nothing if the first gets triggered?"
[22:49:54] <min|dvir|us> That is what I don't understand.
[22:50:21] <courpse> <courpse> .toggle() just changes visibility to hidden right?
[22:50:22] <courpse> now, if i do $('.class').toggle(), if any elements with classes called .class are inside an element with class called .class, they will do nothing if the first gets triggered?
[22:50:31] <courpse> Talking about .toggle().
[22:50:38] <courpse> C'mon, you're allowed to think a lil'.
[22:50:53] <min|dvir|us> SirCmpwn, not even close to being what could be considered anywhere near some pages I've seen.
[22:51:04] <Cork> courpse: the parent doens't matter in the situation
[22:51:14] <min|dvir|us> That code is beautiful compared to some pages burned into my eyes.
[22:51:16] <SirCmpwn> min|dvir|us: but they won't let me fix it!  I have root access to the server and I can't use it!
[22:51:30] <Cork> courpse: $('.class') will select all elements no matter what with that class; and .toggle will run on each one of them
[22:51:38] <courpse> Cork, So ALL elements with class .class well toggle, reguardless of parents state?
[22:51:49] <courpse> Cork, Awesome m8, thanks.
[22:52:02] <SirCmpwn> they're trying to make me maintain it, when it's all I can do to sooth its transition into the other life
[22:52:04] <min|dvir|us> C'mon. You're allowed to think a little.
[22:52:13] <SirCmpwn> It's like hospice for the internet
[22:53:02] <min|dvir|us> courpse, I wish upon the lucky stars that you never get helped on IRC ever again.
[22:53:29] <courpse> min|dvir|us, Likewise about you attempting to help anyone, ;)
[22:53:40] <SirCmpwn> min|dvir|us: I had fun with this lunatic earlier today: http://www.rafb.me/results/ElZ1QM45.html
[22:53:46] <min|dvir|us> courpse, my bad, dude!
[22:53:49] <min|dvir|us> TOTALLY sorry, homie!
[22:53:55] <min|dvir|us> Next time I won't.
[22:53:58] <min|dvir|us> Good lesson to teach.
[22:54:00] <min|dvir|us> Really.
[22:54:03] <min|dvir|us> Fucking idiot.
[22:54:15] <courpse> Keep going, knock yaself out, :)
[22:54:17] <SirCmpwn> you may find the end of that log particularly interesting, where I decide to hand out some IRL protips
[22:54:21] <patac> can anyone help me im having a problem with the $.post function
[22:54:27] <min|dvir|us> courpse, nah. :)
[22:54:36] <SirCmpwn> patac: it just so happens that I can
[22:54:40] <patac> http://jsfiddle.net/UA6cN/ = .complete function is not working
[22:55:27] <SirCmpwn> I shall give it a gander
[22:55:48] <min|dvir|us> patac, $.each( $.parseJSON(data) ... )
[22:55:49] <SirCmpwn> can you be more specific in how it is "not working"?
[22:55:53] <min|dvir|us> I'm pretty sure you're doing it wrong.
[22:56:06] <SirCmpwn> you could do this with much less jquery
[22:56:08] <SirCmpwn> just use a loop
[22:56:19] <SirCmpwn> remember the bad old days before jquery?  think back to your roots
[22:56:41] <SirCmpwn> also, 18 second delay?  seriously?  my neighbor's ISP can go screw themselves
[22:58:13] <patac> hmmm heres what im trying to do if i press the edit button il clear the list of vehicle make and get the list of vehicle make form the database and after i get all the values i will do another function
[22:58:32] <SirCmpwn> patac: add grammar, ask again
[23:02:49] <patac> updated my code i had included another function and a little explaination http://jsfiddle.net/UA6cN/2/
[23:05:26] <patac> can someone please check what can i do to make this work >> http://jsfiddle.net/UA6cN/2/
[23:06:33] <SirCmpwn> patience, someone will come along.  Asking the same question twice is annoying, don't do it
[23:06:54] <patac> sorry..
[23:07:39] <SirCmpwn> patac: it isn't a problem, you'll learn more about IRC etiquette in time.  Remember that almost everyone has a scrollback and can see what was last said
