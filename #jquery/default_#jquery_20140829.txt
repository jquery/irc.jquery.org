[00:45:03] <Macaveli> I'm receiving a Unexpected token: punc (:) on a .map file, how do I tackle this?
[01:21:06] <Daghdha> Hi, anyone know a jquery plugging for marking an area toc rop in an image? Not jcrop though, it does things that don't work for me (It copies the source image and you work onthat wich in my case is a problem)
[01:21:14] <Daghdha> to crop
[01:22:54] <Daghdha> or a rubberband plugin
[01:23:04] <Daghdha> As in a rubberband selection box
[01:23:55] <blez> with jquery, can I have multiple versions in the same page?
[01:24:12] <AdamPDotty> of Jquery?
[01:24:16] <blez> yes
[01:25:01] <AdamPDotty> I do not see why, but yes. You can assign something like ourJQuery = JQuery, then load a new
[01:26:54] <AdamPDotty> There is even a jquery method for that, but I do not find it that fast. Google it!
[01:27:39] <Yaver> hi @ all
[01:27:45] <AdamPDotty> maybe here: http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_noconflict.asp
[01:35:13] <Cork> ?g w3fools
[01:35:19] <b-ot> Cork: W3Fools – Better web education for all → http://www.w3fools.com/
[01:35:20] <Cork> AdamPDotty: ^
[01:35:27] <Cork> don't use w3schools
[01:36:27] <jotterbot> question internet: why would an absolute URL i am providing flowplayer get appended to my current url?
[01:36:57] <Cork> jotterbot: cause it appends the current url to what you give it?
[01:37:43] <jotterbot> eg : https://somesite.com/video.mp4     => becomes : http://192.168.0.22/%22https://somesite.com/video.mp4
[01:37:56] <jotterbot> which causes it to not be able to find the video
[01:38:04] <Cork> or course
[01:38:25] <Cork> jotterbot: but it most likely depends on the lib
[01:38:36] <jotterbot> this is the flowplayer javascript api
[01:38:48] <jotterbot> makes no sense for it to do that
[01:38:59] <Cork> again, so it doesn't support full urls
[01:39:41] <jotterbot> well, that just happens to rustle my jimmys
[01:40:00] <jotterbot> it would help if their docs were at all comprehensive
[01:55:24] <Yaver> It's possible to push a var into $(document).ready?
[01:57:35] <uskerine> Yaver in case it helps: I use  <input type="hidden"> fields and then read the value from $(document).ready
[01:57:44] <uskerine> I am not sure if there is a more elegant way of doing it
[01:58:28] <Yaver> uskerine: i wanna pust it from inside the skript
[01:58:31] <AdamPDotty> why should you?
[01:58:41] <Yaver> http://nopaste.info/68ff3912b3.html
[01:59:27] <uskerine> I am not sure of understanding what you want to do
[01:59:45] <Yaver> i want fill the "message:" with content from an ajax response
[02:00:11] <uskerine> then I think you have to use .done
[02:00:22] <uskerine> a function can be executed on AJAX success
[02:00:32] <uskerine> so you can fill or do whatever is needed there
[02:01:06] <uskerine> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10931836/should-i-use-done-and-fail-for-new-jquery-ajax-code-instead-of-success-and
[02:02:15] <Yaver> ty i try it :)
[02:03:19] <uskerine> .done() is AFAIK the modern way of doing it, if you google you might find also success() but I think it is no longer recommended
[02:03:36] <Yaver> atm i use success
[02:04:58] <sacho_> jqXHR.success() is deprecated
[02:05:22] <uskerine> I am a big fan of things that work, even when they are not the cutting-edge stuff
[02:05:26] <uskerine> :)
[02:06:42] <sacho_> uh huh.
[02:07:04] <AdamPDotty> the deprecation notice is very low on the ajax site
[02:07:18] <Yaver> hmmm :( ReferenceError: text is not defined
[02:07:19] <Yaver> 	message : text.user_exist,
[02:08:15] <uskerine> text = data;
[02:08:21] <uskerine> you are not defining text anywhere
[02:08:34] <uskerine> plus data is only defined within success function
[02:08:49] <uskerine> you should define var text outisde $(document).ready (or inside)
[02:08:50] <uskerine> and use it
[02:09:02] <uskerine> $(document).ready(   var text;
[02:09:02] <Yaver> 						done : function(data) {
[02:09:02] <Yaver> 							text = data; // Response hier passt: {"user_exist":"Der Nutzername existiert schon.","user_not_empty":"Der Benutzername darf nicht leer sein."}
[02:09:02] <Yaver> 						}});
[02:09:39] <uskerine> you have to define text before that, and outside all elements that will use it
[02:10:17] <uskerine> why don't you define it right below $(document).ready(
[02:10:18] <uskerine> ?
[02:10:36] <uskerine> function(){
[02:11:55] <Yaver> http://nopaste.info/f169a207fe.html in this way?
[02:12:11] <uskerine> inside function(){
[02:12:22] <uskerine> move line 03 after 04
[02:12:31] <uskerine> and I think that would work
[02:13:19] <Yaver> the same error
[02:13:38] <uskerine> then I am missing some basic and important stuff about scope in JS
[02:13:58] <uskerine> when does the error take place?
[02:14:03] <uskerine> at text = data?
[02:14:21] <Yaver> on line 60
[02:15:37] <uskerine> maybe you have to move all that stuff within .done: function(){  ... }
[02:15:51] <uskerine> as you want to actually register those events on AJAX success
[02:17:49] <uskerine> or maybe try first and do an empty text object
[02:18:40] <Yaver> if if define var text {}; at start, I've no error but also no content ;)
[02:20:06] <uskerine> then you have to move all JQuery definitions inside success function{}
[02:20:18] <uskerine> so you will define behaviour once you have the actual value from the AJAX response
[02:20:38] <uskerine> that's what I would try to do in your case
[02:20:51] <uskerine> so once you have the data, you define all the other stuff
[02:20:56] <uskerine> right now you are doing it in parallel
[02:21:02] <uskerine> so data is not ready yet
[02:21:56] <Yaver> Hmmm
[02:30:46] <workerbe1two> Hi. I played aroudn with this example here http://www.ajax-cross-origin.com/  and $(elem).html(data)  seems to load even javascript from the data, which is not what I wanted. I wanted jsut the body html code.
[02:33:38] <uskerine> Yaver let me know if that works
[02:33:44] <uskerine> (or any other solution)
[02:33:54] <uskerine> I am curious to know how to fix that
[02:37:56] <Yaver> uskerine: it's doesn't work ;)
[02:37:59] <uskerine> then I am out of ideas, maybe someone else with more experience in JQuery can help
[02:38:30] <uskerine> it might be obvious but put some alerts or console outs to see when text is asigned (and to what) and  when text is used (and to see what it actually contains)
[02:38:31] <Yaver> maybe I've only the wrong point of view
[02:38:33] <uskerine> I use alert with  .toSource() in Firefox (most people use console.out though)
[02:39:26] <uskerine> when I have needed to use values from different part of the code, I have used hidden fields, but I am not sure if there is another way of doing it
[02:41:07] <Yaver> if i set alert (text.user_exist) at the $.ajax the right message is showing
[02:41:27] <uskerine> so the assignment on success/done is correct
[02:41:32] <uskerine> what about when you actually use it?
[02:42:06] <tiblock> Hi. Not an jquery question, but i need service that will show most popular pages on my site and how much peoples on that page currently. Its done true js code from service. I lost name of that service, anybody know?
[02:44:45] <Yaver> yes it is
[02:44:45] <Yaver> but at the 	$('#registration_form').bootstrapValidator( THET TEXT VAR IS NOT SET*
[02:44:45] <Yaver> hmm sry
[02:59:09] <Yaver> uskerine allert with only text shows [Object object]
[02:59:50] <uskerine> are you using Firefox?
[03:00:02] <uskerine> you can do alert(text.toSource()) with Firefox and it decodes the whole object
[03:00:15] <uskerine> and in any case, at least text object is there and can be reach
[03:00:37] <uskerine> that does happen before or after you assign text to the actual stuff at the AJAX done function?
[03:02:50] <Hausas> I have in .css input.hidden-data-hidden { display: none; } and in chrome console when I write $('input.hidden-data-hidden').attr('style') it returns undefined
[03:02:52] <Yaver> hmpf i have to go for a few minutes i comeback later
[03:03:25] <Hausas> Why isn't it returning me 'display:none' ?
[03:23:48] <workerbe1two> Hey. How do I get only the body or another tag from a page that I call by ajax ?
[03:54:14] <AdamPDotty> Where was I?
[03:55:05] <nutzz> If I have something like this http://jsfiddle.net/8n2k9jr1/1/ , how should I select the span with id "product_price" when the buy button is clicked?
[04:05:34] <vishaldeep> nutzz: have you tried anything?
[04:05:40] <nutzz> yes
[04:05:47] <nutzz> one second
[04:05:55] <vishaldeep> nutzz: pls share
[04:06:08] <nutzz> one second please
[04:07:18] <nutzz> http://jsfiddle.net/8n2k9jr1/2/
[04:08:00] <vishaldeep> nutzz: so you want to select the price in the same row, is that right?
[04:08:08] <nutzz> ye
[04:08:16] <vishaldeep> ok
[04:08:18] <vishaldeep> wait a sec
[04:10:06] <vishaldeep> nutzz: here you go http://jsfiddle.net/8n2k9jr1/4/
[04:10:09] <AdamPDotty>  man jquery
[04:10:26] <vishaldeep> nutzz: and may I suggest you change all your ID selectors to classes
[04:10:38] <vishaldeep> since you are going to use those multiple times I think
[04:11:31] <nutzz> vishaldeep: thanks man, yes I will change them
[04:11:45] <vishaldeep> AdamPDotty: are you trying to read jquery manual?? lol :P
[04:11:51] <AdamPDotty> why not .closest('tr').find('.product_price')
[04:12:10] <AdamPDotty> seems smoother
[04:12:20] <vishaldeep> AdamPDotty: that will also do, and is shorter :)
[04:12:29] <vishaldeep> but only after changing to classes
[04:12:40] <AdamPDotty> Does not make any sense with IDs
[04:12:46] <vishaldeep> yup
[04:23:14] <Yaver> retuned
[04:25:35] <Yaver> uskerine it runs for now :D
[04:25:47] <uskerine> doing what
[04:25:57] <uskerine> what did you do?
[04:27:54] <Yaver> 			success : function(data) {
[04:27:54] <Yaver> 				text = data;
[04:27:54] <Yaver> 				alert(text.toSource());
[04:27:54] <Yaver> 				$(document).ready(
[04:28:25] <Cork> Yaver: please don't post multi line code in the channel
[04:28:27] <Yaver> (document).ready as function after $.ajax
[04:28:35] <Yaver> sorry cork
[04:29:08] <uskerine> weird
[04:29:58] <Yaver> :) works for me
[04:30:30] <Yaver> btw .done vs. .success --> .success win's
[04:30:45] <uskerine> I don't think if that's actually very clean
[04:30:52] <uskerine> to have that within the success or donde function
[04:30:54] <uskerine> done*
[04:31:07] <uskerine> I don't think that's*
[04:31:21] <Cork> Yaver: .success is depricated and removed in later versions of jquery
[04:31:32] <Cork> if you meant success: that is another matter though
[04:32:14] <Yaver> Corkwith done it doesn't work
[04:32:49] <Cork> Yaver: what version of jquery?
[04:32:53] <Berserkk> question: is there any plugin that I can use to "load" an html file? I have a project that where I use java ee as back end and pure html/css/javascript for front end. Buts its very annoying writing all the html in a js file. I have some json values I would like to use as dynamic content in the "wrapped" html file also
[04:33:17] <Yaver> Cork 2.2.1
[04:33:24] <Cork> Berserkk: just do $().load(url)
[04:33:49] <uskerine> Yaver I am wondering if having  $(document).ready( within a success or done function is a good practice
[04:33:55] <Cork> Yaver: no
[04:34:01] <Cork> there is no 2.2 version of jquery yet
[04:34:21] <Cork> the latest one is 2.1.1
[04:34:48] <Cork> uskerine: uh, what??
[04:34:50] <Yaver> sory type 2.1.1
[04:34:50] <Cork> no
[04:35:16] <Cork> Yaver: and you write $.ajax().done(function() {}) and it doesn't work?
[04:35:21] <uskerine> Bersekk are you looking for a way to include and reuse html blocks within HTML files?
[04:35:25] <Yaver> hmmm
[04:35:33] <Yaver> no ok i try it this way
[04:35:39] <uskerine> Cork, that's what Yaver did and I am wondering if that's a good idea
[04:36:05] <uskerine> he used $(document).ready() inside the done(function(){})
[04:36:38] <AdamPDotty> does not make sense, but should work
[04:37:01] <uskerine> I don't like it, seems confusing to me and I think it should work without that
[04:37:05] <Cork> $(document).ready() run after the page has loaded is basically a noop
[04:37:14] <Cork> it just calls the function passed to it directly
[04:37:49] <AdamPDotty> like if(1)
[04:37:56] <Cork> uskerine: but what you said was the opposite
[04:37:59] <Cork> uskerine: "having  $(document).ready( within a success or done function is a good practice"
[04:38:15] <uskerine> I said, I was wondering if it was a good practice
[04:38:15] <Cork> it is bad practice
[04:38:33] <uskerine> which is an euphemism to say, I think that's a bad practice but I am not sure about it
[04:38:34] <Cork> no it is bad, jquery just has code to work around it
[04:39:06] <Cork> it checks if the DOMContentLoaded or load event for the page has fired
[04:39:14] <Cork> and if it has it just calls the function passed
[04:40:03] <Yaver> but what is the best way to solv this problem
[04:40:20] <Cork> Yaver: make a jsfiddle.net with the code you have problem with
[04:40:28] <Cork> so we can make sense of the problem
[04:40:49] <Berserkk> cork I have dynamic content thats comes with web serice calls I would like to add these values to the html and then redirect
[04:41:15] <Cork> Berserkk: that sounds like server side code
[04:41:22] <Cork> js don't redirect
[04:41:51] <uskerine> Yaver it should work without that $(document).ready
[04:42:00] <uskerine> if you need that it means there is something wrong out there
[04:42:06] <Cork> uskerine: the read isn't the problem
[04:42:20] <Cork> it is unneeded code, but it isn't the cause of the problem
[04:42:26] <Cork> *ready
[04:42:29] <uskerine> he says that fixs the issue

[04:59:47] <frank_o> whats the best way of telling if a photo is an animated GIF?
[05:00:05] <Cork> Yaver: i don't get it, you want to bind a validator to a form AFTER the post is done
[05:00:16] <Cork> but before the response from the post is handled?
[05:00:36] <Cork> frank_o: the point of animated gifs is that there isn't a good way to tell
[05:00:54] <Cork> you have to run a tool that checks for extra sections in the data part of the file
[05:01:00] <Yaver> the response is only for the textvalues
[05:01:10] <frank_o> Cork: i see..
[05:01:49] <Yaver> Cork: i will store the messages in the DB (multilanguage)#
[05:01:52] <Cork> Yaver: ok so 1. text is global you should most likely either use window.<some variable name that makes sense>  or use var text = data;
[05:01:57] <Cork> or just use data directly
[05:02:11] <frank_o> Cork: trying to use freezeframe.js and jquery-visible to only animate gifs when they're visible in the browser.. http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/9x1ny90v/1/
[05:02:21] <Cork> 2. ya you can remove the $(document).ready(function () { section it just makes the code more complicated
[05:02:45] <frank_o> but to make that work i need to add class="freezeframe" to those images (if they are animated gifs). ill look into what you said, cheers.
[05:02:49] <Yaver> Cork with var text; before the functions it doesn't work
[05:02:54] <Cork> frank_o: browsers normally does this natively
[05:03:12] <Cork> Yaver: and if you remove the ready call?
[05:03:12] <frank_o> they do??
[05:03:30] <Cork> frank_o: yes they only draw images when they are actually visible
[05:03:38] <frank_o> aaah.. sweet..
[05:03:43] <Cork> sure they have a ticker that keeps counting where in the animation they are
[05:03:50] <Cork> but that is very cheap
[05:04:05] <frank_o> sorry what do you mean?
[05:04:18] <Cork> frank_o: when a browser detects an animated gif
[05:04:28] <Cork> they start a ticker that does the animation ticks
[05:04:32] <BillCriswell> frank_o: http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/ this might also be interesting to you if I'm understanding correctly...
[05:04:40] <Cork> this is so the browser know what frame it should draw when it needs to
[05:05:08] <Cork> if the image is visible the needed frame is rendered and compound
[05:06:31] <BillCriswell> Cork: Did you ever see the thing I linked? Pretty awesome performance wise: http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/demo-off.html vs http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/demo-on.html
[05:06:55] <frank_o> Cork: great. thanks so much for the insight, saved me a ton of work :)
[05:07:06] <frank_o> BillCriswell: I'm a superhuge fan of airbnb, checking link now
[05:07:14] <timgauthier> airbnb is rad
[05:07:45] <timgauthier> but i wouldn't say the performance is rad, page loaded and i could scroll but only saw the borders of what had been on my screen
[05:08:13] <timgauthier> after that it's not bad
[05:08:47] <Cork> BillCriswell: not sure what is suppose to be so special
[05:09:02] <Cork> infinity-scroll isn't anything new
[05:09:33] <frank_o> BillCriswell: wow wow wow
[05:09:44] <BillCriswell> It's not infinity scrolling as far as I know.
[05:09:57] <frank_o> BillCriswell: basically it moves stuff out of the dom when it's not visible right?
[05:10:01] <frank_o> so that you free up a ton of memory?
[05:10:19] <BillCriswell> It's like... only rendering the elements in and around the view to make the scrolling a lot smoother
[05:10:35] <BillCriswell> frank_o: I believe that's what's going on haha
[05:10:43] <frank_o> :P
[05:10:50] <Cork> it is shoving all the data into localStorage though
[05:10:53] <BillCriswell> Cork: You don't feel the difference between the on and off?
[05:11:04] <frank_o> cant tell you how much i appreciate the tip
[05:11:07] <Cork> BillCriswell: i have localstorage disabled
[05:11:11] <uskerine> the difference is huge
[05:11:24] <BillCriswell> Cork: Ahhh.
[05:11:34] <BillCriswell> frank_o: No problem.
[05:11:36] <Cork> BillCriswell: with an extension that created a fake shim with a js object
[05:12:08] <Cork> i'm not interested in letting sites store random tracking junk in my browser without asking
[05:12:24] <BillCriswell> Cork: Definitely understandable.
[05:13:06] <BillCriswell> If you're willing to enable it for just that demo I think you'll like it haha
[05:13:28] <Cork> BillCriswell: i've seen them before
[05:13:36] <Yaver> Code cleanup is....
[05:13:56] <BillCriswell> Cork: What would you call that pattern?
[05:14:02] <Cork> mozilla talked about it quite extensively when they implemented firefox sync a few years
[05:14:04] <Cork> + back
[05:14:04] <BillCriswell> Lazy Loading maybe?
[05:14:13] <Cork> no
[05:14:25] <Cork> i don't remember the name though
[05:15:13] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[05:16:10] <workerbe1two> Cork: Hi. I wasnt aware that data from an ajax call loads the js code if passed to   $('#content_div').html( data );  is there a way to only get the html code? its body tag perhaps?
[05:17:07] <Cork> workerbe1two: var dom = $(data); dom.find('script').remove(); $('#content_div').html(dom);
[05:17:26] <frank_o> Damn. My browser goes completely unresponsive @ http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/demo-off.html
[05:20:20] <workerbe1two> Cork: nice thank you.
[05:22:39] <tangorri> hi
[05:23:04] <tangorri> I try to use draggable on <svg> but it has some issue, anyone has some tip plese ?
[05:25:36] <workerbe1two> Cork: hmm. the buttons from the surrounding divs turn flat, without decoration, when the dom is .html(dom) loaded.
[05:26:18] <Cork> workerbe1two: are you loading css in there too?
[05:26:47] <workerbe1two> Cork: havent seen css. only meta and link tags. ..
[05:26:55] <Cork> meta and link...
[05:27:07] <Cork> are you loading a full html page into the content of the existent page?
[05:27:11] <Cork> *exiting
[05:27:20] <Cork> (note that isn't valid)
[05:27:23] <workerbe1two> ah yes. also css
[05:28:02] <Cork> you should split up the page server side so you can send a partial
[05:28:08] <Cork> with just the new content you want
[05:28:12] <workerbe1two> Cork: yes. full html page. actually I only want the body tag and its content.
[05:28:39] <Cork> workerbe1two: make the server just send that part when you make the request
[05:29:30] <frank_o> BillCriswell: is this all it takes to enable it? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/9x1ny90v/2/
[05:30:02] <frank_o> *hoping for magic* ;)
[05:30:18] <workerbe1two>    dom.find('link').remove();
[05:30:28] <workerbe1two> I tried removeing the links but , didnt work.
[05:30:43] <workerbe1two> the css was included with a link tag.
[05:31:25] <Cork> workerbe1two: again don't add a full page to the dom
[05:31:35] <Cork> you will get lots of invalid elements
[05:33:23] <BillCriswell> frank_o: It seems so based on the docs. I still haven't gotten a chance to really put this to work yet.
[05:33:35] <workerbe1two> sure. Ill work on that. still I wonder why    dom.find('link').remove();
[05:33:39] <workerbe1two> did not work.
[05:34:07] <Cork> workerbe1two: cause those are loaded in head not in body
[05:35:38] <workerbe1two>     dom.find('link').remove();
[05:35:43] <workerbe1two> Cork: see , no body involved.
[05:35:47] <frank_o> BillCriswell: Yeah, not sure how to tell. Also the Airbnb on/off might have been partly placebo.
[05:35:53] <Cork> workerbe1two: if you load a full html page, yes there is
[05:36:54] <frank_o> BillCriswell: Also hoping this will compliment something like http://eviltrout.com/2013/02/16/infinite-scrolling-that-works.html
[05:37:17] <workerbe1two> Cork: hmm I dotn understand that sturcture it seems. dom = $(data) . and those find and removes on dom always refer to the body? adn the head elems cannot be removed that way?
[05:37:20] <BillCriswell> frank_o: Haha no way is that placebo.
[05:37:43] <Cork> workerbe1two: $() creates a documentfragment
[05:38:03] <Cork> and it doesn't really have good ways to manage content that isn't inside the body section
[05:38:18] <Cork> workerbe1two: that is why i said you should fix this server side
[05:38:50] <Cork> there is hacks to get around it, but that involves querying things that is inside the body and grab just that
[05:38:59] <Cork> and ya, ugly
[05:39:14] <Cork> (text directly in body isn't possible to query)
[05:39:18] <frank_o> :D
[05:39:24] <frank_o> anyway im out, later Cork, BillCriswell
[05:39:29] <Cork> o/
[05:39:33] <BillCriswell> Later frank_o.
[05:39:43] <BillCriswell> Cork: What does that mean?
[05:39:47] <BillCriswell> Oh duh it's a wave.
[05:39:51] <Cork> lol
[05:39:58] <Cork> ~~~~~\o
[05:40:06] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[05:41:03] <workerbe1two> Cork: so I cannot say body only?
[05:41:20] <Cork> workerbe1two: no, cause body isn't a valid element inside a page
[05:41:30] <Cork> as body is a special treated element in html
[05:41:36] <Cork> it doesn't exist in dom
[05:41:46] <Cork> same with html, document window and a few other
[05:45:47] <Yaver> Cork I've remove the $(document).ready(function () { part but it's not working
[05:45:50] <xxx1337> hey i have a method from a js lightbox library that has json in it
[05:45:55] <xxx1337> i want to pass in xml but im not sure how
[05:46:02] <xxx1337> this is what the method looks like http://hastebin.com/izodenamid.vhdl
[05:46:28] <Cork> Yaver: so they has been a bit confused for a while, what exactly isn't working?
[05:48:43] <Yaver> Cork at the $.ajax request i became a valid result (data.user_exist returned the right content) if i wanna access in the bootstrap validator the var is unknown
[05:50:06] <Cork> Yaver: what content-type is the server sending?
[05:50:35] <Cork> Yaver: actually the url in the fiddle returns php errors
[05:50:51] <xxx1337> anyone know how i can parse the xml file and pass attributes of items in the xml  file to my method?
[05:50:54] <Cork> ah needed the params
[05:51:00] <Yaver> http://photoloc.jffp.net/includes/function.get_text.php?lang=1&group=register_error
[05:51:39] <Cork> Yaver: ok so you return html and not json
[05:51:51] <Cork> you need to tell the server to set the correct content-type for json
[05:51:58] <Cork> Content-Type: application/json
[05:52:12] <Yaver> hmm ok
[05:52:26] <Cork> in php that is <?php header('Content-Type: application/json'); ?>
[05:52:33] <Cork> that should solve your problems
[05:52:40] <thewisenerd> is there any way I could run two custom animations at the same time? (I would like to use slideToggle & fadeToggle at the same time.)
[05:52:41] <Cork> and you should be able to use data
[05:52:48] <Cork> without the need for text or ready or anything
[05:53:20] <Cork> Yaver: http://jsfiddle.net/69rnumrv/2/
[05:54:02] <Cork> thewisenerd: you have to tell jquery to use a different queue
[05:54:24] <Cork> i don't think you can do that with slideToggle or fadeToggle though
[05:54:39] <Cork> animate can though
[05:55:12] <igyiguygyu> Anyone have any ideas how should I approach dynamic height on masonry if the content(child) of each brick is embedded twitter post/facebook post?
[05:55:22] <Yaver> Great :)
[05:55:44] <thewisenerd> Cork, I'm using animate now (http://stackoverflow.com/a/14789419)
[05:55:53] <thewisenerd> Is there any way I can individually time them?
[05:56:29] <Yaver> Cork but you say success: <-- is not up to date?
[05:57:18] <Cork> thewisenerd: animate({ height: "toggle" }, { queue: false }).animate({ opacity: "toggle" }, { queue: false })
[05:57:59] <Cork> Yaver: $.ajax({ success: function() {} }) is fine
[05:58:10] <Yaver> ahh ok
[05:58:15] <Cork> Yaver: so is $.ajax().done(function() {})
[05:58:27] <Cork> Yaver: $.ajax().success(function() {}) is depricated and removed though
[05:59:02] <Yaver> ok now in've only to fix that the captcha doesn't work ^^
[05:59:12] <Hooloovoo> Heya! Anyone know if the jquery ui datepicker has a change event i can listen to? Doesn't seem like the input i set datepicker() on triggers the change when it changes it's value...
[05:59:53] <Hooloovoo> Also, the onSelect thing doesn't seem to work when i use the setDate method.
[06:00:26] <adam-lynch> Hey, I assume if you call a plugin like $(selector, otherDocument).pluginX then the plugin should use the context of otherDocument right?
[06:00:35] <adam-lynch> Like it shouldn't just assume document
[06:01:58] <tomatto_> hi, please how can i unhide something when mouseover is occured on specified div and mouseout is not. about 1-2s?
[06:03:19] <tangorri> how can I get support of svg please ?
[06:04:57] <Cork> tangorri: svg is handled like svg documents in the browser
[06:05:04] <Cork> so events tend to be a bit weird
[06:05:14] <Cork> that might be what is biting you
[06:05:40] <tangorri> Cork I use svg but I have problem with draggable (mouseOffsetted)
[06:05:51] <Cork> tangorri: ya, like i said
[06:06:04] <Cork> svg is handlered as a separate document
[06:06:09] <Cork> so events is a bit weird
[06:06:16] <tangorri> events work
[06:06:30] <Cork> by events i included the data passed to the event
[06:06:35] <tangorri> ok
[06:07:01] <tangorri> So I shouldn't use jquery with svg ? :S
[06:07:55] <Cork> tangorri: the problem isn't in jquery
[06:08:00] <Cork> the problem is in the browsers
[06:08:19] <tangorri> ok but pragmactically ?
[06:08:22] <Cork> tangorri: you will have to figure out if the data if wrong, and correct them
[06:08:32] <tangorri> ok that's all ?
[06:08:33] <tangorri> :)
[06:08:39] <Cork> well some events gets eaten
[06:08:47] <Cork> and a few other nasty problems
[06:08:56] <tangorri> too bad
[06:08:58] <tangorri> :'(
[06:08:58] <Cork> ya
[06:09:19] <Cork> there is a new experimental spec that bases a simplified version of svg onto of the html dom
[06:09:43] <tangorri> see u in ten years then :P
[06:09:46] <Cork> that would make svg a much nicer fit with normal pages
[06:09:55] <Cork> tangorri: possibly ya
[06:10:09] <tangorri> Cork so maybe I juste warp my svg into a div as before ...
[06:10:14] <Cork> as the spec isn't event in proposition mode yet
[06:10:35] <tangorri> that's really missing
[06:12:49] <Cork> tangorri: https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/single-page.html
[06:13:28] <Cork> "SVG [2.0] includes a complete Document Object Model (DOM) and extends DOM4. The SVG DOM has a high level of compatibility and consistency with the HTML DOM that is defined in the DOM Level 1 specification."
[06:14:52] <xxx1337> guys, i have this js method that has json in it for image sources but i want to make an xml file and send in the image sources from items in my xml file
[06:15:06] <xxx1337> this is what my method looks like http://hastebin.com/cagawadeti.vhdl
[06:15:42] <xxx1337> how would i go about getting image sources from my xml file and passing them into that method?
[06:18:31] <Cork> xxx1337: by json do you mean the object at line 1 to 17 or something you send in response to something?
[06:18:40] <Cork> (cause that is an object, not json)
[06:18:52] <Cork> well specifically an array of objects
[06:19:26] <xxx1337> Cork i mean the object at line 1-17
[06:20:16] <Cork> xxx1337: ok sooo...
[06:20:24] <Cork> you want to store xml in your javascript?
[06:20:31] <xxx1337> yep
[06:20:44] <Cork> then you would have to generate xml from it
[06:20:48] <Cork> remove all line breaks
[06:21:04] <Cork> and put it all inside a var xml = '[xml goes here]';
[06:21:17] <Cork> and then you would have to parse the xml to a dom object before you can use it
[06:21:53] <Cork> jquery can help you there with $(xml).find('tag_name')
[06:22:39] <xxx1337> okay, how do i generate xml from js?
[06:25:21] <Cork> xxx1337: var doc = document.implementation.createDocument(null, "report", null); var tag = doc.createElement('tag_name'); var content = doc.createTextNode('http://fpoimagery.com/?t=px&w=500&h=500&bg=0ff&fg=000000'); tag.appendChild(content); doc.documetnElement.appendChild(tag); <loop>
[06:25:41] <Cork> basically xml is horrible to work with
[06:25:46] <Cork> but whats new there
[06:27:05] <xxx1337> ok thanks for helping me out
[06:27:32] <xxx1337> so that first line, am i supposed to pass in the xml file somewhow?
[06:27:49] <Cork> xxx1337: what are you trying to do?
[06:28:13] <Cork> if you want to have xml in the javascript source you won't have files
[06:29:22] <xxx1337> sorry if i wasn't clear its a bit difficult for me to explain
[06:29:31] <xxx1337> basically i have an xml file that looks like this: www.neoscapelabs.com/projects/rxr_northhills/_content/north_hills_gallery/north_hills.xml
[06:29:40] <xxx1337> basically just an xml file with images
[06:30:02] <xxx1337> i want to get the full attribute and get them into that magnificPopup method i posted earlier
[06:30:08] <Cork> ah
[06:30:26] <Cork> simplest is prob to load the xml though an ajax call
[06:32:57] <xxx1337> okay, so i can simply use something like $.get
[06:33:00] <xxx1337> load in the xml file
[06:33:27] <jQueryNewb> Cork: Hi, would you mind having a look at this please? http://liveweave.com/sNcLry I think you'll get the gist of my solution but I'll explain...
[06:33:28] <Cork> $.ajax(xml_url).done(function(xml) { var sources = []; $(xml).find('src').each(function() { sources.push({ src: $(this).text(); } }); $().magnificPopup({ items: sources, ... }); });
[06:33:34] <Cork> xxx1337: something like that ^
[06:35:22] <jQueryNewb> First requred fields are marked red. On focus the bg is set to a neutral color and then validated and colors set accordingly.
[06:35:39] <Cork> jQueryNewb: first of, what is the question?
[06:36:42] <jQueryNewb> Alternating between fields is working but I want to be able to validate the content as well and I'm at a loss on how to achieve that.
[06:38:05] <jQueryNewb> The question is how to set up the events to get this thing going. I'm unable to use the .val() property since the objects are undefined at this piont.
[06:38:56] <jQueryNewb> Am I making any sense?
[06:40:15] <jQueryNewb> Reposting the link to my test case: http://liveweave.com/sNcLry
[06:40:51] <Cork> jQueryNewb: i would recommend doing this by either classes on the element or the html specificed requred attribute
[06:40:57] <xxx1337> thanks for the help cork my boss just came by and helped me out
[06:40:57] <Cork> would make the code simpler
[06:41:05] <xxx1337> gonna afk for a few and try his method
[06:43:01] <jQueryNewb> Cork: hmm... considering...
[06:45:08] <Cork> jQueryNewb: also if you don't really need js if you just want to color the elements on page load
[06:45:54] <jQueryNewb> Cork: that's true I just wanted to put everything related to this in the same place.
[06:48:28] <jQueryNewb> Cork: I think I'll have to have a go at solving this with classes instead and see how that ends. I'll get back if I find a good reason why I couldn't get it to work. Thanks :)
[06:58:16] <adam-lynch> How does a plugin find out what context was passed in $(selector, context).plugin()
[06:58:17] <adam-lynch> ?
[07:00:51] <Macaveli> On what jquery elements can you give focus? for example I have an H3 and I can't give it focus
[07:10:26] <jQueryNewb> OK. Quick CSS question. How can I specify this selector to only select on my class "requiredField"? CSS: input:focus { background:  red; }
[07:11:27] <Guest59577> jQueryNewb: input.requiredField:focus { stuff }
[07:11:54] <jQueryNewb> Guest59577: Ah, cool thanks! :)
[07:17:53] <rob____> hi
[07:23:25] <Guest2604> anyone here
[07:23:53] <decx> no
[07:24:33] <Guest2604> ok bye
[07:31:57] <Allmighty> Hey guys! Have you ever found yourself lost while searching for the best coding tools out there? http://stackeo.me will come out soon to help you with that.
[07:33:58] <jQueryNewb> CSS question: I need to increase the specificity of input.requiredField:focus { background:  red; } and I'm hesitant to use !important. (I'm not in control of the main css file). Do you have any ideas on how to go about it?
[07:35:13] <dmsuperman> that's about it. just move it below whatever rule you're competing with
[07:35:25] <dmsuperman> unless you use an ID which it doesn't look like that's applicable
[07:36:01] <dmsuperman> otherwise talk to whoever is in charge of the main CSS file and have them correct the issue
[07:38:59] <jQueryNewb> Ok. Thanks. Is there a clever way to find out which rule I'm competing with?
[07:42:10] <xxx1337> i have to pass a php variable to my js. I'm doing this:
[07:42:10] <xxx1337> $imageGallery = json_encode($output);
[07:42:31] <xxx1337> does that mean i can simply do an alert(imageGallery); in my javascript to show the contents of image gallery?
[07:52:34] <AlexR2> alert will only pop up text
[07:52:38] <AlexR2> it won't show images
[07:52:40] <AlexR2> or html
[07:53:21] <AlexR2> ie: if you try to do something like alert("<img src='abc.png' />"), the alert will show you <img src="abc.png" />
[07:59:47] <xxx1337> AlexR2: the imagegallery variable is supposed looks like a js object i think
[08:00:17] <AlexR2> then just try it
[08:12:10] <MikeD_> which is 'better' :  $('.foo').find('.bar').find('.etc')  or $('.foo .bar').find('.etc')   ?  (assuming the etc part is same junk but not a simple selector )
[08:13:31] <AlexR2> Relatively no difference, there's no need to optimize that way until you really need it
[08:17:44] <stef1a> i have an array of dom elements and i want to remove the first one. how can i do this? shift() returns undefined.
[08:18:01] <robertmaxrees> is it a jquery object or a DOM object?
[08:18:16] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: how can i tell?
[08:18:21] <stef1a> (and good morning once again)
[08:18:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[08:18:28] <robertmaxrees> how'd you get the array?
[08:18:29] <AlexR2> isinstanceof jQuery
[08:18:36] <robertmaxrees> ^ or this
[08:18:46] <stef1a> var options = $(this).find('#radio-option-group input'); // or .toArray();
[08:19:01] <robertmaxrees> the first one would be a jquery object.
[08:19:03] <AlexR2> rather instance of
[08:19:10] <robertmaxrees> which is array-like
[08:19:26] <robertmaxrees> if you want to just remove it entirely, .remove() works well.
[08:19:35] <AlexR2> .first().remove()
[08:19:36] <stef1a> i just want to get rid of the first element in the array
[08:20:07] <robertmaxrees> .eq(0).remove() and .first().remove() will both do that for you.
[08:20:54] <robertmaxrees> if you just want to take it out of the selection and not out of the page, you could look at using something like .filter()
[08:22:12] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: oh, i see what you're doing. no wonder i'm confused. i want to remove it from the array, not from the page. ('remove' is the ambiguous word here.)
[08:22:23] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[08:22:26] <robertmaxrees> then you want .filter()
[08:22:30] <stef1a> ah.
[08:23:48] <xxx1337> if i have a js variable that contains a string that looks like '[{src="apple",title="apple"},{src="orange",title="orange"}]' how do i convert that into a js object?
[08:23:58] <AlexR2> you can also just do .slice(1)
[08:24:01] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 strings are objects.
[08:24:19] <xxx1337> right hmm im looking at this the wrong way
[08:24:22] <robertmaxrees> .slice(0, 1)
[08:25:42] <stef1a> AlexR2: that returns the entire array: var op = $(this).find('#radio-option-group input'); op.slice(1); returns elements 1-5
[08:26:00] <stef1a> sorry, if i console.log(op); i get all the elements
[08:26:01] <AlexR2> xxx1337: use http://bestiejs.github.io/json3/ - it'll allow you to do things like JSON.parse()
[08:26:26] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah, AlexR2 good call.
[08:26:39] <AlexR2> right because slice doesn't edit the array, it returns a new one
[08:26:47] <AlexR2> you can do .splice(0,1) if you want it edited
[08:27:02] <RhinoBoss> How can I prevent my sortable from allowing multiple selections?
[08:27:15] <stef1a> AlexR2: there we go :-)
[08:31:10] <RhinoBoss> nvm i think i got it
[08:32:09] <RhinoBoss> nope, I didnt get it - I know how to prevent them from sorting, but I need them to not be selectable
[08:32:14] <RhinoBoss> er.. multiselectable
[08:33:31] <robertmaxrees> how do you "Select" multiple things in a sortable?
[08:34:02] <RhinoBoss> ctrl clicking
[08:34:45] <RhinoBoss> shit... im working with someone elses code, but I havent found anything in there that seems to be seting this up, so I assummed it was just an option or something. Perhaps Ive just missed something in the code
[08:34:48] <robertmaxrees> could you show me what you're looking at? because the default setup for the jqui sortable doesn't have that kind of functionality.
[08:39:42] <tristan_1990> Hey Guys. My JSON looks like this - http://pastie.org/9513222. How can I get it into the right format for Google Charts? https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart
[08:39:58] <tristan_1990> Really can't figure out the best way to do it - I'm pretty new to coding
[08:40:06] <robertmaxrees> tristan_1990 by following the format?  are you asking what you need to output differently?
[08:41:20] <robertmaxrees> tristan_1990 the first place to start is by doing an array of arrays, instead of an array of objects.
[08:41:24] <tristan_1990> Yes, I basically just want to make a graph with that JSON
[08:41:24] <laerti> I have a jquery search form with checkboxes and dropdowns, after i do some selections on the search form the results are appearing perfectly, what i need to do is to save this search. I have made the function and i can save it in the database, the problem i have is that i cant save the filter search, means that after i choose the checkbox or dropdown the url does not change. any idea how to
[08:41:25] <laerti> solve it, how can i add any id that after checked or selected i can change the url
[08:41:27] <robertmaxrees> so swap all those { and } to [ and ]
[08:41:47] <tristan_1990> Heres the file that I've made the json with
[08:41:48] <tristan_1990> http://pastie.org/9513233
[08:42:05] <robertmaxrees> tristan_1990 you'll want to go to a php channel for help with the PHP part.
[08:42:05] <tristan_1990> is it possible to do that in that file?
[08:42:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[08:42:10] <tristan_1990> will do :)
[08:42:18] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: When I click a sortable item, it adds a multiselectable-previous class to it. Does this have something to do with it, by chance? I am removing it, but it doesnt change the behaviot
[08:43:12] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss that's not apart of the default jqui behavior afaik
[08:43:14] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/sCxpu/2/
[08:43:30] <robertmaxrees> looks like somebody extended the default sortable on you.
[08:43:40] <RhinoBoss> If only the author of this code wasnt in Germany right now.. :)
[08:44:20] <laerti> I have a jquery search form with checkboxes and dropdowns, after i do some selections on the search form the results are appearing perfectly, what i need to do is to save this search. I have made the function and i can save it in the database, the problem i have is that i cant save the filter search, means that after i choose the checkbox or dropdown the url does not change. any idea how to
[08:44:20] <laerti> solve it, how can i add any id that after checked or selected i can change the url
[08:44:39] <robertmaxrees> laerti no need to spam the channel - there's no way we can help you wiothout seeing any code.
[08:45:05] <laerti> robertmaxrees sorry,  im posting it up
[08:45:34] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: Ahh I see multisortable stuff in the code, Ill dig in and see if that causing it
[08:45:35] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: thanks
[08:45:58] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss fsho - if you can, extract that sucker into a function that you can run only when you need it.
[08:46:13] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: will do :)
[08:46:51] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss whoever did that on you probably didn't consider the repercussions.  this is partially why you don't modify prototypes/object you don't own like that.
[08:47:10] <laerti> robertmaxrees this is the link:  http://jsfiddle.net/plethora/koj5acdh/
[08:47:49] <robertmaxrees> laerti this belongs over in a php room...
[08:48:16] <laerti> robertmaxrees but this is a jquery search, and what is needed is a js function
[08:48:29] <Miles2x> Hello, can I ask questions about jqgrid here?
[08:48:34] <ManBearPixel> laerti: A JS function to save to a Database?
[08:48:45] <robertmaxrees> laerti show us the rendered output then?
[08:48:47] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: well the functionality of our sortables has changed since the original implementation, and it worked great then. So I cant really fault him on that
[08:49:29] <robertmaxrees> Miles2x sure :) just don't expect an answer if nobody knows :)
[08:49:48] <laerti> ManBearPixel yes, to get the selected values from checkbox and dropdowns and save them in db or when u click a checkbox the checkbox value is added in the url
[08:50:04] <robertmaxrees> laerti could you put the rendered html in there instead?
[08:50:18] <laerti> robertmaxrees  yes
[08:50:47] <robertmaxrees> also i see things like onclick="ShowAll()", but I don't see a definition for that function...
[08:50:57] <ManBearPixel> laerti: Sadly I don’t know of a method to modify the URL without rerouting the site. I know how to do that in Angular though..
[08:51:20] <laerti> robertmaxrees  http://jsfiddle.net/plethora/koj5acdh/1/
[08:51:22] <ManBearPixel> laerti: Other than that.. You could do a simple $.ajax call and post the data to a PHP page which from there can save it to a DB
[08:51:24] <robertmaxrees> the html5 history API lets you update the URL.  hashes do that, too.
[08:52:10] <ManBearPixel> afk
[08:52:41] <robertmaxrees> laerti did you try asking in a php channel?
[08:52:44] <Snoopal> how can i use ".find" on dom elements which where added after the page is loaded ?
[08:52:47] <robertmaxrees> because they might be able to help you much better than we can.
[08:52:54] <robertmaxrees> Snoopal by selecting them.
[08:53:00] <laerti> robertmaxrees ok checking
[08:53:15] <Snoopal> what do you mean?
[08:53:28] <laerti> robertmaxrees its invite only
[08:53:31] <robertmaxrees> $('newelement').find('anyselector');
[08:53:38] <laerti> robertmaxrees first time using mirc
[08:53:42] <robertmaxrees> laerti try ##php
[08:53:47] <robertmaxrees> (two hashes)
[08:56:14] <laerti> robertmaxrees Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services
[08:56:24] <robertmaxrees> laerti create an account :)
[08:56:24] <laerti> robertmaxrees  i am registered and logged in
[08:56:33] <laerti> robertmaxrees i have and loged in
[08:56:36] <robertmaxrees> you are obviously not.
[08:57:15] <laerti> im in :)  verified mail adress
[08:57:22] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[09:04:12] <emx> i am using a validator plugin that allows me to define methods to validate fields. one of the fields is the username that needs to be checked for uniqueness through ajax. how do i do that without using sjax (synchronous javascript and xml :P)?
[09:05:03] <emx> i guess only a workaround is possible that first checks the username and when that is valid the whole form is validated with the plugin.
[09:05:44] <robertmaxrees> emx why can't you use ajax?
[09:06:41] <robertmaxrees> you can't check for uniqueness without a reload if you don't submit an async request to your server.
[09:07:39] <robertmaxrees> you could probably use a JSONP based solution though.
[09:08:40] <laerti> robertmaxrees the guys in php told me that i have to ask here lol
[09:08:46] <laerti> robertmaxrees the guys in php told me that i have to ask here lol
[09:09:01] <robertmaxrees> laerti there's no way to help you without seeing your JS then, sooo...
[09:09:40] <laerti> robertmaxrees i have addeed the plain html in feedle thing
[09:10:27] <robertmaxrees> the plain html doesn't tell me what js you have.  if you want to save the search, use something like .serialize() or .seializeArray() and store that somewhere.
[09:12:07] <robertmaxrees> laerti that make sense?
[09:13:16] <laerti> robertmaxrees  im not a good developer :(
[09:13:25] <robertmaxrees> laerti time to learn!
[09:13:32] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery serialize
[09:13:34] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .serialize() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[09:13:38] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery serlializearray
[09:13:39] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Sorry, no results for ‟jquery serlializearray”.
[09:13:51] <robertmaxrees> awwww - http://api.jquery.com/serializearray/
[09:14:19] <robertmaxrees> pick one of those.
[09:14:50] <robertmaxrees> though you said that this is for some kind of search setup right?  that means you're sending your request to your server, so it has the query already
[09:15:01] <laerti> yes
[09:16:47] <robertmaxrees> laerti so if it's already on the server, just save it via your backend...
[09:17:18] <laerti> robertmaxrees dont understand
[09:19:59] <robertmaxrees> does your search currently work?
[09:20:03] <robertmaxrees> does it function as intended?
[09:20:47] <robertmaxrees> except for the saving of the query, i mean
[09:25:11] <emx> robertmaxrees, the reason why i can't use ajax is that as soon as the ajax call is executed the next line in the validator method is executed (while ajax is making the request). this non-blocking behaviour leads to the situation that the validation is incomplete because the answer of the ajax call is not yet available.
[09:25:38] <robertmaxrees> you can make ajax execute synchronously, though that doesn't sound right to me.
[09:25:58] <robertmaxrees> which plugin are you using to validate?
[09:26:05] <emx> robertmaxrees, that's the problem. sjax is deprecated as of 1.8
[09:26:45] <emx> robertmaxrees, jQuery Validation Plugin 1.11.1
[09:27:41] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/22467664/923919
[09:27:45] <robertmaxrees> this seems to cover how to do it.
[09:37:51] <EGreg> hey y'all
[09:37:53] <EGreg> anyone here?
[09:38:02] <robertmaxrees> about 770 of us :)
[09:38:08] <EGreg> JSHint is not accepting jquery.easing.js because of the use of /= operator
[09:38:16] <EGreg> What do I do? I have a pre commit hook that runs JSHint
[09:38:19] <robertmaxrees> wut
[09:38:31] <robertmaxrees> you can ignore files with jshint
[09:39:21] <EGreg> oy, I don't want to ignore adhoc like that though
[09:39:31] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[09:39:32] <robertmaxrees> we do that.
[09:39:48] <robertmaxrees> any file we didn't develop internally doesn't go through jshint
[09:40:29] <emx> robertmaxrees, thanks
[09:40:44] <robertmaxrees> yep
[09:40:46] <emx> i guess this is the clean implementation
[09:42:45] <scottbuckel> i'm loading a form via ajax, how can I use jQuery to detect the form .submit?
[09:42:45] <scottbuckel> usually you need to do somethign liek $(body).on('click','#mybutton',function(){});....but $(body).on('submit') doesn't want to work
[09:43:24] <robertmaxrees> scorphus you'd use event delegation.
[09:43:36] <robertmaxrees> you want to capture the submit event of the form.
[09:43:49] <robertmaxrees> $('body').on('submit', 'yourform', function() {});
[09:48:31] <scottbuckel> robertmaxrees: doens't work, hmm, "yourform" being the ID of my form, right?
[09:48:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:48:57] <robertmaxrees> that means something is stopping the propagation of that event.
[09:49:08] <robertmaxrees> or you have some invalid markup.
[09:49:10] <EGreg> It's not good practice robertmaxrees, what if jshint catches something :P
[09:49:27] <robertmaxrees> welp
[09:51:15] <robertmaxrees> EGreg why would i hint files i don't want to change?
[09:51:20] <EGreg> what do you mean
[09:51:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to change anything within jquery core, for instance, or a plugin.
[09:51:40] <robertmaxrees> so why lint them as apart of my normal flow?
[09:51:58] <EGreg> becuase you might aptch them or  reject them after learning that tthey break in some browsers?
[09:52:09] <dmsuperman> you would just do that one time
[09:52:10] <robertmaxrees> i don't patch 3rd party plugins.
[09:52:17] <dmsuperman> also that :P
[09:52:20] <robertmaxrees> that's asking for pain.
[09:52:22] <robertmaxrees> and regret.
[09:52:47] <robertmaxrees> and we verify all plugin compatibility before letting them into our codebase.
[09:52:52] <dmsuperman> metallica wrote a song about patching 3rd party plugins
[09:53:12] <dmsuperman> "my friend of misery"
[09:53:15] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[09:53:46] <dmsuperman> ;)
[10:00:27] <mortal1> if I wanted to 'find' li's with a class of foo
[10:00:41] <mortal1> wouldn't that just be find('li .foo')
[10:00:43] <mortal1> ?
[10:00:45] <robertmaxrees> li.foo
[10:00:49] <robertmaxrees> no space.
[10:00:50] <mortal1> ahh
[10:00:54] <robertmaxrees> just like css.
[10:01:00] <robertmaxrees> avoid using the element if you can, though
[10:08:45] <xxx1337> Can someone please answer this question for me? http://jsfiddle.net/njL6g384/
[10:10:53] <scri66le> anyone know how to reset all the values of a select ?
[10:11:10] <Woet> what do you mean by "reset all the values"
[10:11:14] <robertmaxrees> scri66le store the original state, then restore those values later on.
[10:11:57] <scri66le> I am pulling in values from the db and when another select changes it pulls in different values but currenly it's adding ot what's already there
[10:12:05] <scri66le> I want ot clear the values, then add the new ones
[10:12:15] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/njL6g384/1/
[10:12:29] <robertmaxrees> scri66le $('select').remove('option').
[10:12:33] <robertmaxrees> then rebuild your select.
[10:15:02] <scri66le> http://jsfiddle.net/ofs7c11x/
[10:15:10] <scri66le> get the idea? robertmaxrees
[10:17:09] <dmsuperman> yes that is correct scri66le
[10:17:28] <scri66le> doesnt' work dmsuperman
[10:17:29] <dmsuperman> oh sorry
[10:17:35] <dmsuperman> move the remove outside the each
[10:17:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:17:51] <dmsuperman> right now you are saying "remove all options. add option 1. remove all options. add option 2. remove all options. add options 3"
[10:17:54] <dmsuperman> etc
[10:18:31] <robertmaxrees> also no need for a jquery each in there.
[10:20:47] <xxx1337> robertmaxrees: that doesn't seem to work :(
[10:20:58] <xxx1337> here is the magnific documentation if it helps: http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html#initializing_popup
[10:21:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:21:09] <EGreg> so what do you do when the plugin you want isn't great
[10:21:14] <EGreg> and it's the only one they got
[10:21:19] <robertmaxrees> EGreg depends.
[10:21:31] <EGreg> what do you do when you went for a walk and then you're on the spot?
[10:21:34] <EGreg> I tried to rhyme it
[10:21:46] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 "this doens't seem to work" and then sending me documentation isn't going to get you very far lol.
[10:22:00] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 try doving it manually first without the string.
[10:22:33] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: please remove the term "doesn't work" from your vocabulary :P you've used it several times and each time somebody has had to ask you to clarify. just skip straight to the clarification
[10:22:42] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[10:23:00] <xxx1337> lol
[10:23:02] <robertmaxrees> EGreg what does the plugin do?
[10:23:08] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 you laugh, but he's serious.
[10:23:44] <robertmaxrees> "doesn't work" is ephemeral.  are you getting an error?  is it doing something unexpected?  is it not doing anything at all?  does your browser crash?  you're asking us to diving information for you.
[10:24:19] <robertmaxrees> fiddle is great when you can give me a functioning example - don't just paste code in there.  try to create a minimal verison of what you've got.
[10:24:32] <xxx1337> for some reason that js doesnt work i think
[10:24:34] <robertmaxrees> add in the html, js, and css necessary to the your plugin to work.
[10:24:38] <xxx1337> JSON.parse
[10:24:41] <robertmaxrees> "doesn't work" how?
[10:24:45] <xxx1337> is that the correct syntax?
[10:25:01] <robertmaxrees> yes.  JSON.parse() will parse a string and turn it into an object.
[10:25:25] <robertmaxrees> add add the necessary bits to the fiddle and show us how it's not working.
[10:26:18] <robertmaxrees> JSON.parse assumes that the string will be valid btw.
[10:26:18] <xxx1337> if i have my code looking like this http://jsfiddle.net/njL6g384/2/
[10:26:30] <xxx1337> magnific wont even pop up the images when i click on the event that should pop them up
[10:26:39] <robertmaxrees> fix your string.
[10:26:47] <robertmaxrees> i can see something invalid there.
[10:27:38] <xxx1337> the extra comma?
[10:27:41] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:27:44] <xxx1337> that should make any difference
[10:27:48] <robertmaxrees> yes
[10:27:53] <robertmaxrees> trailing commas are invalid.
[10:27:57] <xxx1337> its the json.parse line that causes issues
[10:28:06] <xxx1337> unless u mean remove it from the json.parse?
[10:28:09] <robertmaxrees> the JSON.parse() can't parse it if it's not valid.
[10:28:10] <xxx1337> you*
[10:28:14] <xxx1337> oh ok
[10:28:28] <dmsuperman> also depending on your implementation I think attributes must be quoted too right?
[10:28:52] <robertmaxrees> haven't heard of that one.
[10:29:00] <robertmaxrees> maybe though
[10:29:21] <xxx1337> removing the comma doesnt seem to solve anything
[10:29:31] <xxx1337> so i need to add quotes to the attributes?
[10:29:32] <robertmaxrees> do you get any console errors?
[10:29:44] <robertmaxrees> your updated fiddle doesn't contain anything different from the old one.
[10:30:10] <robertmaxrees> could you please add magnific and jquery to it, along with the requisite html?
[10:30:15] <shoky> json quotes must be double quotes. and keys need to be quoted
[10:30:52] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 if you can control the output data, why output it as a string in the first place, btw?
[10:30:54] <robertmaxrees> also shoky++
[10:30:54] <dmsuperman> weird, never knew the double quotes
[10:31:03] <dmsuperman> I guess I don't write much by hand
[10:31:16] <shoky> http://www.json.org/
[10:31:18] <xxx1337> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token s common.js:5 (anonymous function)
[10:31:29] <xxx1337> it points to the json.parse line
[10:31:39] <dmsuperman> read what shoky wrote
[10:33:39] <dmsuperman> notice how the first letter in your json string is an s, and that's what it's complaining about. it's telling you to quote your keys
[10:34:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/njL6g384/4/ working json.parse example for ya
[10:36:53] <igyiguygyu> I have a question. What would be the most optimal way to write wp plugin that appends,removes and sorts divs only by index within a container?
[10:38:29] <robertmaxrees> wrong room for that :)
[10:39:00] <igyiguygyu> had to try it! ha
[10:39:04] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:44:01] <fission6> how do i get an array of all text for each <li> item, $('li').text() just gives a big string
[10:44:24] <robertmaxrees> enumerate through the textnodes and get them,.
[10:46:07] <robertmaxrees> .contents() will get you part of the wa there.
[10:56:47] <karstenk1977_> hello
[10:57:30] <karstenk1977_> all in friday or is here a nice guy who would help me to find an error with a element on which a event is binded, but I cannot find that wrong event
[10:57:38] <karstenk1977_> ?
[10:57:39] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ karstenk1977_
[10:57:40] <b-ot> karstenk1977_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:58:53] <karstenk1977_> iam not professional enough to identify, why the blue buttons on that site hide after closing the dropdown function second time, no error, no other notice: http://shop.hausmanngmbh.de/#http://shop.hausmanngmbh.de/mobilitaet/elektro-fahrraeder/atb.html
[10:59:23] <robertmaxrees> karstenk1977_ can you create a minimal test case to demonstrate the problem?
[10:59:29] <karstenk1977_> in the List, the"Details anzeigen" button, when you click two times the error
[11:00:01] <karstenk1977_> no, the problem is relying by that side, cant create a test case, cause iam not knowing which scripts involved
[11:00:17] <robertmaxrees> karstenk1977_ are you the programmer for this site?
[11:00:49] <karstenk1977_> no i have bought this template and try to integrate it in magento, which is basicly using prototype
[11:01:08] <robertmaxrees> prototype.js?
[11:01:13] <karstenk1977_> but i get no errors, so its hard for me to identify
[11:01:15] <karstenk1977_> yes
[11:01:19] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like what you really need is to hire a developer to work this out for you.
[11:03:12] <karstenk1977_> or somebody explain me how i can trace that event from element?!
[11:03:26] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to read through the code, karstenk1977_
[11:03:47] <karstenk1977_> it is a jquersy plugin, all compressed
[11:04:01] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to read through the implementation on your end.
[11:04:10] <karstenk1977_> no chance to trace it with firebug?
[11:04:33] <robertmaxrees> you can, but tracing through plugins isn't generally something you want to do.
[11:09:15] <grodt> http://hastebin.com/ujavicisiy.coffee I have an issue where I have 3 photos, if I click one it spotlights it, but I have an issue where if I click another photo really quick, they both are spotlighted, I cant figure out how to only have one at a time
[11:09:34] <grodt> I think its because of the fadeTo with 500ms timing
[11:09:39] <grodt> how can I work around this?
[11:10:06] <robertmaxrees> could you show us?
[11:10:18] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to .stop() some animations from running
[11:10:50] <grodt> http://templates.fucoso.com/ctg/chef_christophes_team.html
[11:11:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you want to .stop() and revert things back to their original state.
[11:13:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd change that script up a bit and, instead of binding everything like that, do one event listener instead.
[11:14:35] <grodt> robertmaxrees, trying to implement the stop right now
[11:23:16] <jeffreylevesque> can someone tell me what the call() function does?
[11:23:28] <robertmaxrees> the method on fundtions?
[11:23:48] <robertmaxrees> *functions
[11:23:48] <jeffreylevesque> i have [].map.call(links, function (el) {
[11:23:50] <jeffreylevesque>     return el.getAttribute("videofile");
[11:23:52] <jeffreylevesque>   });
[11:23:57] <jeffreylevesque> sorry about the multiple lines
[11:24:13] <robertmaxrees> .call() allows you to control scoping.
[11:24:30] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[11:24:31] <grodt> robertmaxrees, I tried with the first click function, http://hastebin.com/ozivoyuqep.coffee but it seems I am doing it wrong
[11:24:40] <robertmaxrees> grodt could you setup a jsfiddle instead?
[11:25:40] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: it controls scoping?
[11:26:01] <jeffreylevesque> what's the best way to get all elements with a certain class
[11:26:24] <grodt> robertmaxrees, sure! http://jsfiddle.net/bmtr3an2/
[11:26:41] <jeffreylevesque> I'd like to store all elements pointers with a particular class into an array
[11:27:57] <respek> afternoon all
[11:28:13] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque .call() allows you to call a function on an object and specify what the `this` value is
[11:28:23] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs on MDN
[11:28:35] <robertmaxrees> grodt err... i was looking for just the relevant bits heh
[11:28:46] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: in this case, it says this is 'links'?
[11:29:09] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque yep.
[11:29:34] <grodt> robertmaxrees, ah I put the js part in the js box area though
[11:29:50] <grodt> and the 3 circles are there
[11:29:53] <robertmaxrees> grodt you also didn't include any of the dependencies.
[11:30:03] <robertmaxrees> let me show you the easier way to get the help you want.
[11:30:29] <robertmaxrees> oh woah.  really tightly coupled.
[11:31:26] <grodt> Im guessing I need to redo it all but know whats the route
[11:31:30] <grodt> dont*
[11:32:31] <robertmaxrees> create a single click event listener for all chefs.  find all that aren't the current one and run .stop(), then animate the change back.
[11:33:00] <robertmaxrees> also, your face animations don't stop execution.  the code is fired offto start them and thgings keep trucking on.
[11:33:37] <grodt> why dont they stop with $(".tiera, .chad").stop(true).css('opacity', 0.2).fadeTo(500, 1.0);
[11:33:56] <robertmaxrees> that should work just fine.
[11:34:00] <robertmaxrees> your test case is overly comples.
[11:34:03] <robertmaxrees> *complex
[11:34:08] <robertmaxrees> i was looking for an isolated example.
[11:34:13] <grodt> my bad
[11:34:22] <grodt> thanks robertmaxrees I shall try the new way
[11:38:18] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque what are you trying to do?
[11:38:37] <robertmaxrees> ah stepping through a queryselector or something.
[11:42:23] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: I'd like to store reference of dom elements with a specific class, perhaps into an array
[11:42:44] <robertmaxrees> var someElement = document.querySelectorAll('.theClass');
[11:42:45] <robertmaxrees> done
[11:43:08] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: is someElement an array?
[11:43:24] <robertmaxrees> someElement will be array-like, yes.
[11:43:28] <robertmaxrees> but why do you need the array?
[11:43:57] <jeffreylevesque> I want to later to be able to iterate through the array, and apply specific click events to them based on other class attached to the element
[11:44:08] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[11:44:17] <robertmaxrees> though why not just do the separate classes later?
[11:44:36] <jeffreylevesque> trying to be generic
[11:44:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:45:04] <jeffreylevesque> an element could have 'myCLass unique1'
[11:45:13] <jeffreylevesque> if it has myClass then an event is created
[11:45:20] <robertmaxrees> why not use event delegation instead?
[11:45:24] <jeffreylevesque> unique1 determines what kind of event
[11:45:27] <jeffreylevesque> what is that?
[11:45:49] <robertmaxrees> it lets you bind one listener.
[11:45:59] <jeffreylevesque> what is the best way
[11:46:08] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[11:46:59] <robertmaxrees> so you could do $('.myContainer').on('click', '.myClass', function() {}); for your one handler, and then also do $('.myContainer').on('keypress', '.someInput', function() {}); for another
[11:48:50] <jeffreylevesque> i have form input elements with 'name_values' and class 'add_element'.  So, each element with 'add_element' will have an event listener.  The name value is unique, and therefore determines when the event listener is triggered to append html to the element with that name
[11:49:16] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:49:19] <jeffreylevesque> *with 'name' values, and class
[11:49:20] <robertmaxrees> event delegation.
[11:49:33] <Sna4x8> I've inherited a jQuery application that has absolutely no testing harness.  I would like to automate some E2E tests before making changes to the code base - any suggestions on what to use?  (I'm very comfortable with jasmine, karma, and protractor currently.)
[11:50:12] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque inside the delegation listener, the `this` object is the element that the event came from.
[11:52:59] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: so, I currently have `$(body).on('click', '.add_element', function() {});`
[11:53:13] <robertmaxrees> if you can bind lower, btw, do it.
[11:53:18] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, that'll work.
[11:53:34] <AlexR2> Anyone know of a way to detect scroll down event when you're already at the bottom of a page?
[11:53:47] <AlexR2> (other than on('mousewheel', ...
[11:54:06] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: so within `function() {}` I want to do either an if-else, or case statements on 'this'?
[11:54:08] <robertmaxrees> AlexR2 that'd be the mousewheel event...
[11:54:15] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque if else, yeah.
[11:54:26] <robertmaxrees> you can treat $(this) like any other jquery object.
[11:54:37] <robertmaxrees> AlexR2 why can't you use that?
[11:54:41] <AlexR2> robertmaxrees: issue is that if i only track mousewheel event, then if someone uses the scrollbar itself, it's not captured
[11:54:58] <AlexR2> and if i'm capturing both, then my event gets called twice for each event
[11:55:01] <robertmaxrees> AlexR2 what's the problem you're solving for?
[11:55:07] <AlexR2> infinite scrolling
[11:55:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[11:55:48] <AlexR2> my sentiment exactly hehe
[11:56:22] <robertmaxrees> why not trigger the load before they get there?
[11:57:27] <AlexR2> i handle that, but eventually they get to the bottom
[11:58:39] <AlexR2> it's a failsafe for when there's no cached content ready to be displayed and i don't want to spam the api
[11:58:48] <AlexR2> so it's possible to get to the bottom if someone's really trying
[11:58:58] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[12:25:14] <dmsuperman> AlexR2: I don't think there's a way to detect scrollbar dragging if there's no movement, I don't think the OS reports that to the application
[12:25:30] <dmsuperman> AlexR2: you could check for arrow keys and space bar and pgup/pgdn and at least try to accommodate everybody else
[12:38:18] <AlexR2> fair enough, solution #2 - never allow them to hit the bottom of the page :-) scroll up 1 px when they hit the bottom
[13:03:03] <John3k> hi is there any chance i can push a parameter to map_options variable used by googlemaps?
[13:03:29] <chrisshattuck> I want to click a button with jQuery using $('.mybutton').click(), but it doesn't seem to be triggering click events for the button. Any thoughts on what could be getting in the way?
[13:03:33] <John3k> it's an array but i have to push the value into it before it is used, somehow
[13:05:30] <John3k> hm well or overwrite the array someone
[13:05:33] <John3k> somehow
[13:12:16] <dmsuperman> chrisshattuck: are you sure hte click events are bound corretly? additionally something like this could be getting called: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[13:12:50] <chrisshattuck> dmsuperman: Thanks, I was thinking there might be something with the proagation. I'll keep digging, thanks!
[13:22:15] <jeffreylevesque> what version of jquery is required for 'event delegation' - http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/?
[13:24:23] <mortal1> robertmaxrees: belated thanks for your help
[13:29:06] <phoenixsun> I was using 'innerText' and I have found as I am sure many people already know that it doesn't work in Firefox
[13:29:26] <phoenixsun> I switched to textContent and that still isn't working
[13:29:33] <phoenixsun> in Firefox
[13:30:27] <phoenixsun> actually what I meant to say is that it is working but it has introduced an element of whitespace in IE
[13:36:40] <naeluh_FRIDAY> hello
[13:36:57] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque any?
[13:37:22] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque .on() has supported it since at least 1.8, if not earlier.
[13:38:17] <robertmaxrees> chrisshattuck how was the event bound to the element?
[13:39:22] <chrisshattuck> robertmaxrees: It was a button that triggered an ajax form submission. I figure that the app is stopping propigation, but I haven't dug into where that's happening yet.
[13:40:59] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:41:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused.  you said something about firing a click event on it.
[13:56:14] <sam-lap> anyone have problems with google maps api ?
[13:58:31] <frank_o> Hi! For "read more" style truncation / fading out of text -- which one do you prefer? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/mgw408nv/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qLy91pdk/2/
[13:59:20] <xxx1337> hey i know i'm late but thanks to all who helped me earlier
[13:59:30] <xxx1337> sorry for being super unclear
[13:59:32] <erming> frank_o: the fade was pretty sweet.. but i prefer the "..." still
[13:59:56] <frank_o> erming: yeah feel the same thing myself
[13:59:57] <erming> the fade feels a little messy, in my opinion
[14:03:28] <frank_o> damn man why'd you leave
[14:03:34] <frank_o> was gonna share something cool :/
[14:07:34] <frank_o> erming: welcome back man
[14:07:39] <erming> thanks :>
[14:07:52] <erming> working on an IRC client, had to reboot
[14:08:33] <frank_o> really? wow
[14:08:51] <erming> http://shout-irc.com:9000/
[14:09:08] <erming> (might get flooded if many people click and try to connect to freenode.. hehe)
[14:09:37] <frank_o> that looks really pretty
[14:09:46] <erming> thank you.. spent alot of hours on that stuff. lol
[14:09:49] <shout-user> like really really pretty :)
[14:10:14] <frank_o> is it gonna be a competitor to that pay irc thing? forgot its name
[14:10:38] <erming> irccloud
[14:10:42] <erming> well, basically, yeah.. it does the same thing
[14:10:43] <frank_o> yeah!
[14:10:50] <erming> but mine is free and self-hosted
[14:11:02] <erming> "sudo npm -g install shout" and you're pretty much done
[14:11:24] <erming> it's a node.js backend
[14:11:43] <frank_o> nice
[14:12:13] <frank_o> you designed the layout yourself?
[14:12:44] <frank_o> looks pro. even got those classy outlined buttons
[14:14:13] <erming> i've had like.. 3-4 re-designs, haha
[14:14:43] <erming> i need to go.. have a good one frank_o
[14:15:07] <frank_o> peace out man
[14:15:22] <frank_o> :)
[14:20:57] <tomatto_> hi, please how can i unhide something when mouseover is occured on specified div about 1-2s and mouseout is not in that period of time?
[14:29:24] <uskerine> hi, this should submit a "Y" for field "foo" when submit as part of a form? <input name="foo" type="checkbox" value="Y" class="styled">
[14:30:21] <Leuchtfeuer18___> Is there any way how I can get a JavaScript (jQuery) stacktrace? My problem is an "Script is unresponsive" alert
[14:31:46] <dmsuperman> tomatto_: take a look at setTimeout and clearTimeout
[14:32:02] <dmsuperman> tomatto_: as well as jquery .on .hide .show
[14:32:40] <dmsuperman> uskerine: if the checkbox is checked, yes. if not, it will not submit "foo" at all
[14:32:58] <uskerine> ok
[14:33:01] <uskerine> something weird with bootstrap then
[14:33:16] <dmsuperman> Leuchtfeuer18___: chrome and firefox have debugging tools that allow you to step through code
[14:33:22] <dmsuperman> probably IE too
[14:33:57] <Leuchtfeuer18___> dmsuperman: I use firefox
[14:34:10] <jeffreylevesque> could someone review my basic 'delegation listener' - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/2ca445c98ab46d21800ff117b2c7661ed77a5b50/src/js/html_form.js
[14:34:11] <Leuchtfeuer18___> dmsuperman: with firebug
[14:34:13] <dmsuperman> it's under tools -> web dev or something like that
[14:34:57] <jeffreylevesque> the browser console says - 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined html_form.js:21'
[14:35:31] <dmsuperman> you're passing the result of running the event handler once instead of running the event handler
[14:35:53] <dmsuperman> which in this case is null or undefined, since your delegator_callback doesn't return anything
[14:36:07] <dmsuperman> what you mean is $('form input').on('click', '.add_element', delegator_callback);
[14:36:27] <dmsuperman> you want to pass a reference to the function itself
[14:37:29] <jeffreylevesque> dmsuperman: so for the callback, don't pass in parameters?
[14:38:13] <dmsuperman> a(b) is different from a
[14:38:17] <jeffreylevesque> dmsuperman: like $('form input').on('click', '.add_element', delegator_callback);
[14:38:24] <dmsuperman> a(b) is a reference to the result of the function a, a is a refernece to the function a
[14:38:35] <dmsuperman> yes, exactly like I wrote above there :P
[14:38:57] <jeffreylevesque> now console.log doesn't output anything
[14:39:06] <jeffreylevesque> and what if the callback requires parameters
[14:39:46] <dmsuperman> you click the .add_element and you don't get a console.log?
[14:39:53] <dmsuperman> if that's the case then your element must not have 2 classes
[14:40:05] <jeffreylevesque> yes, sir. nothing
[14:41:46] <jeffreylevesque> dmsuperman: i did `return console.log( $(this).attr('class') );` and console.log prints nothing
[14:42:08] <robertmaxrees> prop, not attr
[14:42:11] <robertmaxrees> and don't return it :)
[14:42:13] <dmsuperman> ...why are you doing return console.log?
[14:42:59] <jeffreylevesque> accident
[14:43:28] <jeffreylevesque> i did `console.log( $(this).prop('class') );` and it still prints notihng in the console
[14:45:45] <frank_o> erming: still there?
[14:46:26] <dmsuperman> jeffreylevesque: update your paste
[14:52:50] <jeffreylevesque> dmsuperman: https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/12c0570d6888575751dfccb647b10c2fdaf9deda/src/js/html_form.js
[14:54:30] <dmsuperman> which jquery version jeffreylevesque
[14:54:56] <jeffreylevesque> 1.8.3
[14:55:40] <robertmaxrees> is add_element an input?
[14:56:01] <robertmaxrees> because all you really need is $('form').on('click', '.add_element', delegator_callback);
[14:56:07] <dmsuperman> true
[14:57:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cyveg1co/
[15:01:07] <jeffreylevesque> howcome one doesn't pass parameters to callback functions, what if i have 2 or more defined in the callback definition?
[15:01:11] <dmsuperman> jeffreylevesque: to answer your question, if you need to pass parameters to the callback, you have two options. Using an iife (if the parameters need to be passed at time of binding) or by passing extra arguments to .trigger at time of execution
[15:01:51] <dmsuperman> if you aren't triggering the event via .trigger('click') and you are just clicking the input, you'll have to use an iife
[15:01:59] <robertmaxrees> "an iife"?
[15:02:08] <robertmaxrees> how does an IIFE help there?
[15:03:00] <robertmaxrees> he could do an anonymous, inline handler.
[15:04:53] <dmsuperman> oh right I guess that's what I meant
[15:04:57] <dmsuperman> brain fart
[15:05:12] <dmsuperman> function(event) { return delegate_callback(event, arg1, arg2); }
[15:05:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:05:33] <robertmaxrees> though you can also do almost everything inside the handler, too.
[15:05:42] <robertmaxrees> or use .bind()
[15:05:53] <robertmaxrees> i prefer .bind() myself.
[15:06:04] <dmsuperman> jquery .bind ?
[15:06:08] <robertmaxrees> javascript bind
[15:06:10] <dmsuperman> ah
[15:06:29] <robertmaxrees> jquery bind is bad :)
[15:06:46] <robertmaxrees> well, not so much "bad" as "deprecated".
[15:10:40] <givemeawhoopwhoo> hey guys, i have a table with three columns, in each third coloumn of each row is a arrow .png, im trying to use it as a way to track where you are when reading the table of info. I have a fade toggle going to click the row and have the arrow come and go but any idea of how i would make it that the fade is exclusive? meaning if one .png is showing, all the rest are faded?
[15:11:49] <dmsuperman> givemeawhoopwhoo: make a selector which finds all the arrows, hide them, then show the currently active one. bonus points if you use .not on the selector to hide them
[15:13:44] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman++
[15:26:52] <uskerine> how to uncheck and check an input type="checkbox" in JQuery?
[15:27:05] <robertmaxrees> .prop('checked', true)
[15:27:08] <robertmaxrees> .prop('checked', false)
[15:27:13] <uskerine> thanks
[15:27:22] <uskerine> a bit off-topic but...
[15:27:24] <robertmaxrees> jQuery, btw.  the j is lowercase :)
[15:27:27] <uskerine> should it work with bootstrap?
[15:27:28] <uskerine> ok
[15:27:29] <uskerine> jQuery
[15:27:32] <robertmaxrees> yes, it should.
[15:27:35] <uskerine> thanks
[15:27:37] <robertmaxrees> any form input
[15:28:07] <DeliriumTremens> What ever happened to jqueryui grid?  I see posts about it from 3 years ago about it being nearly complete then nothing...
[15:29:03] <robertmaxrees> it held things up too much and was let go for now.
[15:29:49] <robertmaxrees> jqui and jqmobile are going through some pretty big changes right now anyway
[15:29:53] <robertmaxrees> so we might see it again some day
[15:29:57] <DeliriumTremens> right on
[15:30:18] <DeliriumTremens> i'm new to the js/jq business, looked like it would be helpful for a current project
[15:30:56] <robertmaxrees> i mostly use just jquery and avoid jqui.
[15:31:38] <DeliriumTremens> i'm finding it pretty useful for an extension i'm making
[15:31:46] <robertmaxrees> sure
[15:58:15] <uskerine> I am getting "on" as value when <input type="checkbox"> are typed, is that a bootstrap custom stuff?
[15:58:22] <uskerine> are typed=are checked
[15:58:42] <givemeawhoopwhoo> how can i select a child of this?
[15:58:57] <givemeawhoopwhoo> so i want to select a td when i click on a certain tr
[15:59:15] <givemeawhoopwhoo> and get that td to do something, but all other td's to do something else
[15:59:38] <givemeawhoopwhoo> i was putting $(this ".class") for example but doesnt work
[16:02:11] <givemeawhoopwhoo> figured it out thanks
[16:07:46] <uskerine> for some unknown reason .prop("checked", true) does not work
[16:08:37] <uskerine> any idea or tip to debug is welcomed
[16:11:58] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Are you sure you're targeting the element?
[16:12:11] <NinjaBanjo> `api prop
[16:12:11] <b-ot> NinjaBanjo: .prop(): Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[16:12:39] <NinjaBanjo> doesn't look like it takes a second arguement
[16:13:23] <BillCriswell> NinjaBanjo: It definitely does.
[16:13:35] <NinjaBanjo> -_- i didn't scroll down for enough lol
[16:13:43] <BillCriswell> Happens haha
[16:13:45] <NinjaBanjo> i promise, not a noob
[16:14:04] <NinjaBanjo> uskerine, can you post a jsbin or similar please?
[16:23:00] <jake_poll> im doing an ajax search which brings me back the whole page as response back from the server.. How can i grab certain parts of the response back?
[16:25:05] <BillCriswell> jake_poll: What do you mean by "ajax search" exactly?
[16:25:26] <jake_poll> BillCriswell:  just a simple search form
[16:26:35] <jake_poll> BillCriswell:  when i do $('.properties').html(resp); brings me up the entire page.. sorry im kinda new with this
[16:27:09] <aitiba> hi
[16:27:10] <BillCriswell> Ok, that makes it a lot clearer.
[16:27:32] <aitiba> anyone know a jquery plugin to create redimensions for my images?
[16:27:51] <BillCriswell> jake_poll: You can get the elements you want from resp by doing like $(resp).find('.somethingInTheHtml');
[16:29:11] <jake_poll> BillCriswell:  i will try
[16:29:50] <NinjaBanjo> BillCriswell, jake_poll it sounds like your returning more from the backend than you need to?
[16:30:23] <jake_poll> NinjaBanjo: yes im returning back the whole view
[16:30:51] <NinjaBanjo> jake_poll, if it is an ajax call, why not return only the part that you need to add to the page? keep your request overhead down.
[16:32:36] <jake_poll> NinjaBanjo:  in that case i will have to render my response in a different template?
[16:33:43] <NinjaBanjo> I can't answer that one as I'm not sure what your backend looks like. Even better though, if you have a template on the page, you can return json and use the browser to do a loop and fill in the template in the browser, only having to request data
[16:36:20] <NinjaBanjo> jake_poll, ^^
[16:37:18] <jake_poll> NinjaBanjo: i can return a json but i will have to build the whole html back in the response
[16:39:34] <BillCriswell> jake_poll: I feel like we may be missing something here.
[16:42:56] <BillCriswell> jake_poll: why does anything besides the results need to come from your ajax request?
[16:43:03] <Fenhl> in a .fail callback, how do I pass more than one argument to the next .fail?
[16:44:05] <Fenhl> I tried returning an array, but that just puts the array as the first argument
[16:44:58] <Fenhl> as an example, this is what I tried: https://github.com/wurstmineberg/assets.wurstmineberg.de/blob/dev/js/common.js#L472-L478
[16:51:19] <BillCriswell> Fenhl: I think I'd need to see some pseudo code.
[16:51:58] <BillCriswell> The fail callbacks arguments are jqXHR, textStatus and error as far as I know.
[17:00:41] <Fenhl> BillCriswell: I just posted real code
[17:05:21] <Fenhl> BillCriswell: this is where the callback is handled further: https://github.com/wurstmineberg/assets.wurstmineberg.de/blob/dev/js/profile.js#L577-L600
[17:06:10] <Fenhl> the problem is that with the current code, the error variable that I try to compare to 'personNotFound' is actually undefined
[17:07:26] <Fenhl> because the return value of the first .fail callback is bound to what I called deferred in the 2nd callback
[17:08:03] <Fenhl> does that make sense?
[17:08:36] <jake_poll> BillCriswell: this worked quiet good the only issue is that if theres already data in $(".properties") it get repeated after the response back http://jsfiddle.net/19nxyreu/
[17:09:55] <BillCriswell> You'd need to rename the container to something unique.
[17:11:23] <BillCriswell> When you do $('.properties').html() it's finaling all properties and just repeating again and again and again.
[17:14:08] <jake_poll> BillCriswell:  i tried this http://jsfiddle.net/19nxyreu/1/
[17:14:21] <jake_poll> BillCriswell: but doesnt work
[17:14:46] <BillCriswell> Fenhl: I'm having a hard time following what's going on to be honest. I don't find myself in situations like this too often.
[17:15:14] <BillCriswell> jake_poll: You didn't change the properties container name.
[17:15:27] <jake_poll> BillCriswell: but its unique
[17:15:58] <BillCriswell> No it's not. You're putting other .properties into .properties.
[17:16:22] <BillCriswell> $('.properties').html() is going to update ALL .properties html.
[17:16:52] <BillCriswell> You'r also remove all properties on submit?
[17:21:04] <jake_poll> BillCriswell:  you were right.. fixed now
[17:25:21] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[17:27:53] <Fenhl> BillCriswell: does this help? http://hastebin.com/icunabayey.js
[17:28:50] <Fenhl> basically it's supposed to call displayError('no such person') and instead calls displayError('undefined: undefined')
[17:30:17] <Fenhl> and I'd like to change the first .fail callback so that the second .fail callback receives three separate arguments instead of a single array
[17:30:37] <Fenhl> because that's the default behavoir for $.ajax
[17:31:41] <Fenhl> and it's supposed to also work if API.foo or API.bar fails
[17:32:09] <Fenhl> that is, in that case it is supposed to call the displayError in line 15
[17:33:06] <Fenhl> but if the person is not found as indicated by a failed personById call, it's supposed to call the one in line 13
[17:35:02] <robertmaxrees> Fenhl not sure what all you're doiung but you should look at doing something like this: http://fixee.org/paste/5diok6q/#url=h6y0n05
[17:35:16] <robertmaxrees> woops I mean this http://fixee.org/paste/5diok6q/#url=lp8wdf1
[17:38:59] <Fenhl> okay I think I'll just go a different route and use separate $.when calls for personById and the other two
[17:40:19] <robertmaxrees> you can use the same $.when for all of them iirc.
[17:42:31] <Fenhl> yeah but then I can't differentiate between the errors correctly
[17:42:55] <Fenhl> because one has only one argument because I wrote that and apparently it's impossible to pass on more than one
[17:43:08] <Fenhl> and the other ones have 3 args because they're $.ajax errors
[17:44:03] <NinjaBanjo> Fenhl, can you redefine the function to act as you wish it to? because it sounds like your problem is that you want to use the function in a way different than it works
[17:45:13] <Fenhl> NinjaBanjo: I solved the problem by doing this: https://github.com/wurstmineberg/assets.wurstmineberg.de/commit/1544f33ebff39343c7c5cf5974cee323b9073c1e
[17:45:15] <robertmaxrees> don't redefine jquery methods btw.
[17:45:28] <robertmaxrees> what's one way.
[17:47:05] <BillCriswell> Fenhl: so in short you want to have a bunch of requests and be able to tell which one failed?
[17:47:36] <Fenhl> BillCriswell: yes
[17:54:30] <robertmaxrees> wait isn't that what .then is for?
[17:58:29] <BillCriswell> I think the goal is like foo.fail(function(){ return 'This error is for foo...'; }); $.when(foo, bar, baz).done(...).fail(...); and having the .fail there be able to get the special error.
[18:00:14] <BillCriswell> In theory, of course.
[18:00:32] <BillCriswell> Like passing along an extra, optional parameter to .fail()...
[18:01:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah something like that.
[18:01:13] <robertmaxrees> i really need to just dive into deferreds at some poitn./
[18:01:15] <robertmaxrees> *point
[18:02:13] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Usually shoky shows up and just throws out 3 lines of code that do whatever I was unsure about haha.
[18:02:51] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I rarely find myself in situations where I need to do anything too crazy with them, though.
[18:03:59] <robertmaxrees> right?
[18:04:34] <Madqued> whats wrong with this http://jsfiddle.net/19nxyreu/3/?
[18:05:09] <robertmaxrees> missing the jquery library inclusion?
[18:05:14] <robertmaxrees> also, use .prop(), not .attr()
[18:05:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/19nxyreu/5/\
[18:05:57] <robertmaxrees> console.log() instead of alert(), and no need for ul.pagination, unless you have multiple elements with the class pagination.
[18:05:58] <tw2113> what's wrong with .attr?
[18:06:16] <robertmaxrees> generally you want to read the DOM property, not the HTML attribute.
[18:06:20] <BillCriswell> Unless you actually want the href, .prop('href') would return the full url where .attr('href') would return what's actually in the attribute.
[18:06:35] <Madqued> difference between href and prop?
[18:06:40] <robertmaxrees> attr and prop
[18:06:58] <Madqued> got it
[18:07:01] <Madqued> yeah
[18:07:04] <BillCriswell> Dinner time. Later everyone!
[18:07:05] <Madqued> im stupid today
[18:07:10] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/prop/ this has a pretty good rundown
[18:10:19] <tw2113> prop gave me this: "http://fiddle.jshell.net/properties/search"
[18:10:21] <tw2113> attr gave me this: "/properties/search"
[18:10:29] <tw2113> for anyone confused and paying attention
[18:10:29] <robertmaxrees> prop gives you the underlying DOM property value :)
[18:10:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/42dusbuv/1/
[18:10:58] <robertmaxrees> this is a simple way to show the distinction
[18:53:23] <popl> Hey, I'm using jquery-ui's autocomplete with a remote datasource (solr) and it's working OK (I have a dropdown box getting populated with suggestions now) but I was wondering what the best way to go about actually putting an autocomplete thing in the actual text input was.
[18:53:58] <popl> E.g. if I typed 'Mi' and the top result in the dropdown box was 'Mike', I'd like to put 'Mike' in the background of the text input (like a watermark).
[18:54:01] <popl> Is that possible?
[18:55:20] <Crucials> popl: isnt that what autocomplete already does?
[18:56:27] <popl> Crucials: As far as I've got it working (and from the examples I've seen on the website) it just shows options in a drop-down menu (and you can cycle through them).
[18:57:49] <popl> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#default # Like here
[18:58:40] <Crucials> I see
[18:59:05] <popl> So it gets me halfway, I guess. :)
[18:59:17] <Crucials> yeah
[18:59:43] <Crucials> and i know what you mean by "suggesting" the completion in the background but not sure how i would approach it
[18:59:56] <Crucials> i can think of some hacky ways :P but nothing you would want to use
[19:00:07] <Crucials> i suppose you could sort of do what browsers do in the address bar?
[19:01:27] <popl> What do you mean?
[19:01:30] <shoky> popl: do you mean like this?  http://jsfiddle.net/yxpacmqf/
[19:02:42] <Crucials> what shoky just linked is exactly what i meant :D
[19:03:02] <Crucials> its not a gray sort of faded out version of the completed answer, but its the completed answer selected
[19:03:26] <popl> shoky: thank you
[19:03:27] <shoky> faded out version is a placeholder, those are for when no text has been entered yet
[19:03:44] <shoky> (and you can have those using the placeholder attribute)
[19:03:48] <popl> right, Google has something like that but I don't know if it's an image or what (because you can't select it)
[19:04:00] <shoky> it's a placeholder ;p
[19:04:17] <popl> It could very well be!
[19:04:30] <Crucials> how would it be a placehollder if you already have text in there?
[19:04:55] <popl> I was considering something like what you did but I didn't know the name/ids of the autocomplete widgets.
[19:04:58] <popl> thanks again shoky
[19:05:28] <shoky> welp that's what i was saying, Crucials, placeholder is only for when there's no text
[19:05:37] <shoky> np popl
[19:05:56] <Crucials> but you just said placeholder before! argh my brainz
[19:07:04] <shoky> i was saying, gray fadeed out text is how you display placeholder text, which is not what he was looking for, but nevermind ;p
[19:08:25] <Crucials> google does have a version which instead of selecting the rest of the text, just displays it as if it was a placeholder
[19:08:40] <Crucials> i suppose it could be just the same but with styling the selection
[19:08:45] <Crucials> or some other wizardry
[19:09:18] <shoky> the standard ui way to do it is like in my fiddle
[19:09:21] <popl> shoky: That'd be cool, actually.
[19:09:27] <popl> shoky: My boss wants Google. :P
[19:09:37] <popl> I'm like "You don't have Google."
[19:09:40] <popl> But whatever. :)
[19:13:26] <Crucials> I mean this kind of thing http://jsfiddle.net/yxpacmqf/1/
[19:13:41] <Crucials> but of course you would need a bit of messing around to make it seem more natural
[19:13:52] <Crucials> and less awkward for the user if they actually tried to select it
[19:15:40] <shoky> o, didn't know bout ::selection
[19:17:36] <Crucials> i refuse to have default selection colors on any of my sites :P
[19:18:36] <shoky> heh
[19:18:58] <shoky> what color do you use
[19:19:02] <popl> Crucials: That's neat, but if you look at Google you'll notice that the grayed-out text isn't selectable.
[19:19:13] <popl> orange? ;)
[19:19:21] <Crucials> usually a dark red
[19:19:26] <Crucials> or something that fits the site
[19:19:38] <Crucials> ah popl
[19:19:42] <Crucials> well what you COULD do
[19:19:49] <popl> "I like to make all my sites look like the MS Hot Dog Stand theme."
[19:19:51] <popl> ;)
[19:19:57] <Crucials> and it was what i was originally thinking but deemed too hacky
[19:20:07] <popl> hah
[19:20:08] <popl> hacky
[19:20:26] <popl> You should see the code I have to deal with every day. 13 year old Perl. :P
[19:21:39] <shoky> ahh 13 year old codebases
[19:21:46] <shoky> flush them to hell
[19:22:08] <popl> shoky: It's my first job away from Walmart in a new city. I take what I can get. :)
[19:22:12] <shoky> i also deal with those, too many :(
[19:22:29] <popl> happy to be programming again
[19:22:36] <popl> even if I was thrown into the deep end
[19:22:39] <shoky> yeap just ranting ;p
[19:22:46] <shoky> to myself
[19:22:54] <popl> shoky: It's ok.
[19:23:01] <popl> shoky: Usually people have the pub for that.
[19:23:03] <popl> :)
[19:23:07] <shoky> ;p
[19:24:15] <popl> I think ranting is actually outlined somewhere in RFC 1459.
[19:24:26] <popl> /ctcp #channel rant
[19:25:07] <shoky> ;]
[19:28:26] <Crucials> I just tried to create a proof of concept but its gross so i stopped
[19:28:40] <Crucials> but basically i was going to put a box behind input, that has the completed text in it
[19:28:57] <Crucials> you wouldnt be able to target it and it would like its comlpeting the actual input
[19:29:18] <Crucials> but yeah.. no.. http://i.imgur.com/moJDIyh.png
[19:30:58] <Greener> http://jsfiddle.net/myezb53h/2/ <--- any idea what to do here? I'm trying to combine selecting by class and nth-child.
[19:32:10] <Greener> Disregard, apparently :eq(n) exists
[19:34:47] <popl> Crucials: That's an idea I had too. Don't feel dirty. :)
