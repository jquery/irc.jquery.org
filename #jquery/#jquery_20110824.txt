[00:15:38] <durre> hi! I have a scenario where I have two listeners. one on "mouseenter" and another on "mouseleave", each listener on different elements. the problem is that "mouseleave" is executed first. I want it the other way around so I can mouseenter-event.stopPropagation and stop mouseleave from happening. can it be done? :)
[00:38:52] <Paveloosha> Hi, is it posible to get only text part "my text is here" from <div id='myDiv'><strong>Address</strong>my text is here</div> ?
[00:39:14] <MrSamuel> Paveloosha: yeah there are two nodes you can get the second one
[00:39:14] <Paveloosha> Without using SPLIT !!
[00:39:28] <MrSamuel> element.childNodes[1] i think is correct
[00:39:56] <Paveloosha> <MrSamuel>, thanks let me try..
[00:42:39] <Kjartan> Hello, I am having a great deal of trouble finding a solution to my problem. I am trying to position an element inside a frameset by using .scrollTop(). But it does not seem that .scrollTop() considers being inside a frame. I've googled around but the results are most for iframes and/or not applicable to my problem.
[00:43:10] <nail_> Paveloosha: if you want to do it no matter how many childs there are you could do like $('#myDiv').clone().find('*').remove().end().text()
[00:44:32] <Paveloosha> <MrSamuel>, it is not working,
[00:44:49] <Paveloosha> <nail_>, thanks let me try
[00:45:54] <Paveloosha> <nail_>, grrrrrrrret.. it is working correctly..
[00:46:07] <Paveloosha> Thanks
[00:46:10] <nail_> np
[00:50:25] <fRAiLtY-> I have this http://www.blackwellprint.co.uk/send/ which has validation on (val.js) the fields to check they're not blank, it also replaces the submit button with a loading gif. How can I make it so this only replaces the submit button when val.js isn't needed, i.e when the fields are null
[00:50:37] <fRAiLtY-> Code http://pastie.org/2420944
[00:57:57] <aaairc> when doing an ajax request... what is the most expensive part of the journey... database to web framework... web framework to html.... html delivered to browser? i know it will depend on the type of data, etc being requested... but generally is there one step that normally vastly outweighs the others?
[01:01:58] <timing> hi guys
[01:02:20] <timing> is there a good way to strip 'px' from element.css('marginTop');
[01:02:26] <timing> I can use replace but it feels stupid
[01:04:59] <Paveloosha> <nail_>, I need know one thing, what is "*"  doing in here "$('#myDiv').clone().find('*').remove().end().text()" ? I googled, but didnt find it!!
[01:05:41] <aaairc> meaning is sending data to browser is by far the most costly?... so i shouldn't worry about trying to be efficient with the number of database queries...  for example, it would be preferable to do 15 separate smaller requests using ajax, which means 15 separate database queries... versus doing 1 larger page request, that will require only 1 database query, but i would send the equivalent of all 15 separate requests over the wire at the 
[01:05:41] <aaairc> time...
[01:07:44] <nail_> Paveloosha: it selects all elements (excluding text nodes)
[01:08:35] <Paveloosha> <nail_>,then what if I need to select text nodes?
[01:10:07] <gjvc> aaairc, if you are a pattern spotter, have a look at the facade pattern.
[01:10:10] <xec> Paveloosha: remove() will remove text nodes contained in the elements
[01:11:37] <nail_> Paveloosha: there's a "textchildren" plugin that does that, or you'll have to do traverse it manually
[01:11:50] <nail_> s/do //
[01:12:21] <aaairc> gjvc: what is a pattern spotter?
[01:12:41] <Paveloosha> <xec>, thanks. <nail_>, manually like!!
[01:13:11] <nail_> (that's what the plugin does, it iterates over sub nodes and takes those with nodeType == 3)
[01:15:10] <Paveloosha> Okay, thanks a lot. trying to make one..
[01:15:57] <nail_> I remember there's a good section about dom traversal in the "Pro JavaScript Techniques" book
[01:17:32] <aaronmcadam> mornin lads
[01:19:14] <aaairc> does anyone know a good site that discusses how to increase page load performance... specifically if there is a expected percentage of time that the database query, the webframework assembly into html, and then the delivery of content to the browser are each supposed to take?
[01:21:00] <Kichael> What's the difference between a deferred.then and a deferred.done?
[01:21:45] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano was talkin bout that yesterday
[01:21:54] <aaronmcadam> then depends on success
[01:22:01] <aaronmcadam> done depends on it finishing
[01:22:15] <aaronmcadam> iirc
[01:22:54] <nail_> the other way :) with then you can bind for .done and .fail at once
[01:22:54] <fRAiLtY-> I have this http://www.blackwellprint.co.uk/send/ which has validation on (val.js) the fields to check they're not blank, it also replaces the submit button with a loading gif. How can I make it so this only replaces the submit button when val.js isn't needed, i.e when the fields are full. Code http://pastie.org/2420944
[01:23:36] <Kichael> oh okay, so .then is when the function is called successfully, and .done is when the function that was called actually finishes execution?
[01:23:37] <aaronmcadam> cheers nail_
[01:25:14] <nail_> Kichael: nope, it's really a shortcut, .then(a,b) is like .done(a).fail(b)
[01:25:17] <xec> Kichael: other way around, see nail_'s comment and read up http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[01:25:49] <yan_nick> Hey guys, can you see the misstake? I cannot see it. http://jsfiddle.net/MgFLv/ :c
[01:25:52] <aaronmcadam> ahh cool nail_ thanks for the clarification dude
[01:26:08] <nail_> welcome :)
[01:26:20] <tankblergh> hi guys! I'm a javascript/jquery novice, so I have an easy question for you. I'm putting the val(); of html-elements into an array, and post this with ajax. I use the firebug console to see the values that I've posted, and they are all the value of "on". where does this come from? is it a default value?
[01:26:49] <formers> fRAiLtY-: are you still at that ?
[01:27:03] <fRAiLtY-> formers: Thought I'd cracked it
[01:27:12] <fRAiLtY-> as I added validation, it messed up the button :x
[01:27:19] <aaronmcadam> tankblergh: that's what a checked checkbox returns
[01:27:42] <fRAiLtY-> I click the button to submit the form, validation kicks in, but submit button changes anyway. I only want the submit button to change when validation isn't needed if that makes sense?
[01:27:58] <aaronmcadam> what you want is $(el).is(':checked') or $(el).checked tankblergh
[01:27:58] <tankblergh> I see, but I havent included checkboxes?...strange
[01:28:07] <aaronmcadam> might be something else then?
[01:28:11] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ tankblergh
[01:28:23] <aaronmcadam> damn bot-t where are you
[01:28:28] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle it tankblergh
[01:28:40] <formers> fality: are you able to put it onto jsfiddle.net so I can edit it ?
[01:28:42] <aaronmcadam> tankblergh: http://css-tricks.com/13414-seriously-just-make-a-jsfiddle/
[01:28:49] <tankblergh> ah, thanks
[01:29:00] <formers> fraility: are you able to put it onto jsfiddle.net so I can edit it ?
[01:29:13] <aaronmcadam> whack it up there, is the form complicated tankblergh
[01:29:28] <tankblergh> not really
[01:29:44] <aaronmcadam> cool put it up there and I'll look at it
[01:29:51] <tankblergh> thank you
[01:30:00] <Kichael> can I pass a reference to multiple functions to a $.when? since I want to pass in multiple ones to wait until they finish executing and it would be ugly to have them all in line
[01:30:18] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah
[01:30:32] <niKnight> hello. I need help. I'm a noob like tankblergh. I dont understand what things like  })(mejs.$);  or (function (f) {   I've written many javascript functions and fixes and upgrades over the years, but these syntax layouts are just so off the wall to me. I'm working with the MediaElementPlayer for html5 video playback. I've explored his downloadable examples which are all compressed with a,b,c labeled shortened names. Its just so backwa
[01:30:33] <fRAiLtY-> formers: I'll give it a go
[01:30:35] <aaronmcadam> $.when.apply(null, funcs) i think was the pattern ajpiano uses
[01:30:35] <fRAiLtY-> 2 secs
[01:30:36] <nail_> yan_nick: shouldn't you add some gallery[nid] = []; after the "var nid..." one?
[01:30:43] <formers> fRAiLtY-: ok
[01:31:00] <yan_nick> nail_: Ôh, checkout this http://jsfiddle.net/dN9EY/
[01:31:28] <aaronmcadam> niKnight: you're looking at minified or compressed versions
[01:31:42] <niKnight> holy crap
[01:31:53] <aaronmcadam> niKnight: what you think are "off the wall" are just closures
[01:31:55] <formers> you might be looking at the compressed version, try and get the actual non-minified version
[01:32:06] <niKnight> aaronmcadam: I complety understand what you mean. because I'm working with a .min.js or whatever
[01:32:09] <formers> ^^niknight
[01:32:12] <aaronmcadam> fundamental js features dude
[01:32:21] <aaronmcadam> yep niKnight
[01:32:30] <niKnight> I understand, I've been on the php / mysql side of the fence for 5 years
[01:32:38] <aaronmcadam> yeah no worries
[01:32:39] <niKnight> I'm crossing over for some rapid jquery dev
[01:32:41] <nail_> yan_nick: your fancybox ressources fail to load
[01:32:50] <aaronmcadam> once u understand em they're very powerful and handy
[01:32:51] <yan_nick> nail_: checkout your console.
[01:32:51] <nail_> they send back a 403
[01:33:07] <fRAiLtY-> formers: http://jsfiddle.net/kwhaU/
[01:33:10] <fRAiLtY-> Is that right?
[01:33:13] <fRAiLtY-> Never used it before :x
[01:33:43] <formers> fRAiLtY-: yup, give me a sec
[01:33:51] <nail_> yan_nick: it seems you can't hotlink to fancybox
[01:33:58] <yan_nick> nail_: sure?
[01:34:09] <xec> yan_nick: maybe you want gallery as an object and not array?
[01:34:21] <Kichael> the .apply pattern is pretty slick, aaronmcadam
[01:34:26] <Kichael> thanks
[01:34:30] <nail_> yeah, check your network activity, they send back 403, but they don't if you access them directly
[01:34:30] <yan_nick> xec: it should looks like [{}, {}]
[01:34:42] <aaronmcadam> yeah apply is for an array of funcs, you know right?
[01:34:53] <aaronmcadam> sorry if that's obvious :D
[01:35:00] <Kichael> no it's new to me :)
[01:35:04] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[01:35:06] <Kichael> just read up on it
[01:35:08] <aaronmcadam> look at call too
[01:35:17] <niKnight> while I reset my thought process. what could (mejs.$) mean?
[01:35:24] <niKnight> what does the $ represent?
[01:35:27] <aaronmcadam> very common under the hood of libraries Kichael
[01:35:31] <xec> yan_nick: what should it contain?
[01:35:35] <aaronmcadam> niKnight: $ === jQuery
[01:35:41] <yan_nick> xec:'title' and 'href'
[01:36:13] <Kichael> so it will .call on all the func in the array, inside the .when, and then when they're all done, call the last function that requires the others to be done, that's so much simpler than nested callbacks that broke async before that I was doing...
[01:36:19] <xec> yan_nick: check out http://jsfiddle.net/MwHJ6/ - type in gallery in the firebug lite
[01:36:23] <niKnight> basicly, I'm very much in need over some orientation.
[01:36:53] <aaronmcadam> Cool, catch up with ajpiano later he might be able to clarify things further for ye
[01:36:56] <yan_nick> xec: th x for showing me the feature, very cool!
[01:37:18] <aaronmcadam> Kichael: look at this pubsub plugin for jquery, it's a really good example of call/apply: https://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js
[01:37:27] <aaronmcadam> good example of functional js
[01:37:29] <xec> there you get {[{title,href},{...}],[...]}
[01:37:33] <yan_nick> xec: but why they're 4 item? i just have 2 in each of the big divs
[01:37:52] <xec> you select again rather than using this
[01:37:58] <xec> inside your loop
[01:39:22] <yan_nick> xec: but the value has a new value in the second loop
[01:39:41] <xec> what value?
[01:40:52] <yan_nick> xec: var nid
[01:41:21] <xec> yes, but youre looping through the same blocks twice
[01:41:44] <xec> try $(this).find(".gallery-image-wrapper").each(....
[01:41:50] <fRAiLtY-> formers: Did that work OK?
[01:41:53] <niKnight> aaronmcadam: one last question, how can a } end in })(mejs.$);  ? I see a semicolon, thats an end of statement, so how and what the heck........... (abc.$) === the jquery #### of abc?
[01:41:56] <xec> line 6
[01:42:17] <formers> fRAiLtY-: Yeah i've updated it, just waiting for jsfiddle to respond.
[01:42:19] <aaronmcadam> yeah abc.$ isn't valid
[01:42:25] <yan_nick> xec: ah! got it, thx
[01:42:34] <aaronmcadam> it works like this niKnight
[01:42:37] <fRAiLtY-> formers: K no problems
[01:42:40] <niKnight> mejs.$ is?
[01:42:48] <xec> yan_nick: youre welcome :)
[01:43:02] <Trisox>  ? jsfiddle down
[01:43:03] <aaronmcadam> (function( $ ){ .... })( jQuery );
[01:43:10] <xec> Trisox: not just you
[01:43:14] <Trisox> :D
[01:43:18] <niKnight> okay why ( $ ) ?
[01:43:19] <xec> ooh up again
[01:43:21] <xec> xD
[01:43:25] <niKnight> what is that called?
[01:43:32] <aaronmcadam> it's so that I can use $ within the closure
[01:43:39] <aaronmcadam> where jQuery === $
[01:43:43] <Trisox> yup
[01:44:01] <niKnight> so function ( jquery ) { code } ) ( ??? ) ;
[01:44:06] <aaronmcadam> so i'm making sure my code runs in it's own context
[01:44:18] <aaronmcadam> that won't make sense
[01:44:28] <aaronmcadam> unless you want jquery to be something else
[01:44:39] <Trisox> ?jquery extended
[01:44:47] <Trisox> no bot!! :(
[01:44:54] <aaronmcadam> the final ( ??? ) part sets what the ( jquery ) part will be niKnight
[01:45:02] <niKnight> so whats the purpose of the final query, lets assume i understand function ($) part
[01:45:06] <niKnight> why declare it
[01:45:11] <aaronmcadam> it keeps it contextual
[01:45:25] <niKnight> okay.
[01:45:31] <aaronmcadam> and your code separated from other scripts that may be present
[01:45:39] <blackspotwiggins> it creates a closure that has guaranteed access to jQuery object from $
[01:45:39] <Trisox> other libs also
[01:45:44] <Trisox> it reserves it
[01:46:01] <aaronmcadam> thanks for the backup guys :D
[01:46:10] <yan_nick> xec: but now there is something what doesn't work.
[01:46:10] <Trisox> $ gets reserved in side that function for jquery
[01:46:17] <niKnight> so, its like <jquery> </jquery> in the sence that function ($) opens and (jQuery) is close?
[01:46:21] <yan_nick> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/9cFFc/
[01:46:26] <blackspotwiggins> niKnight, no
[01:46:26] <niKnight> i know my html example is horrible
[01:46:27] <niKnight> but
[01:46:31] <aaronmcadam> lol
[01:46:33] <Trisox> hey blackspotwiggins
[01:46:34] <blackspotwiggins> learn js syntax pls
[01:46:43] <niKnight> well i've never seen this before
[01:46:43] <aaronmcadam> haha he didn't mean it like that
[01:46:52] <niKnight> thanks aaronmcadam
[01:46:55] <aaronmcadam> niKnight: you've *kind of* got it
[01:47:03] <xatnys> ˆˆ
[01:47:31] <aaronmcadam> niKnight: example for you, a jQuery plugin: https://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js
[01:47:41] <niKnight> okay
[01:47:47] <xec> yan_nick:  what's not working
[01:47:49] <aaronmcadam> notice line 12, ";(function(d){"
[01:48:02] <aaronmcadam> and then line 76: "})(jQuery);"
[01:48:04] <yan_nick> xec: take a look in the gallery[60] array
[01:48:14] <niKnight> see right there.  ======== stab in eye.
[01:48:22] <aaronmcadam> the variable d represents jQuery within the plugin code
[01:48:43] <aaronmcadam> who stabbed ya lol
[01:48:46] <niKnight> thats arbitrary, that could be anything
[01:48:56] <niKnight> d could be knightsWildVariable
[01:49:05] <xec> yan_nick: you're missing a . in your class name
[01:49:21] <aaronmcadam> yea yea
[01:49:24] <yan_nick> xec: cannot belive that .... okay it's morgning...
[01:49:27] <xec> :D
[01:49:35] <niKnight> but why start with ;
[01:49:38] <niKnight> like why!?
[01:49:39] <niKnight> lol
[01:49:41] <niKnight> how
[01:49:43] <xatnySgroW> easy
[01:49:43] <aaronmcadam> but this plugin is so simple it's not a massive issue
[01:49:50] <xatnySgroW> you can start with ;;;;; also
[01:49:51] <aaronmcadam> there's more commenting than code in there
[01:49:52] <xatnySgroW> valid
[01:50:08] <xatnySgroW> its for closing any other thing you didnt closed before
[01:50:15] <aaronmcadam> niKnight: it means that your code will always work because the ";" will finish any trailing code before your code is loaded
[01:50:18] <kromack> Hi, this simple lines of jquery code give me an error on IE9 : ')' expected, my tests shows that this is at the line 7 or 8 , I can understand it ! please help :
[01:50:18] <kromack> http://pastebin.com/r3HNSL44
[01:50:38] <aaronmcadam> otherwise, the parser ignores it and continues niKnight
[01:50:54] <niKnight> okay, i'll just swallow that
[01:50:57] <niKnight> i get it
[01:51:00] <aaronmcadam> yep
[01:51:13] <aaronmcadam> it's safeguarding against shite js code
[01:51:18] <niKnight> exactly
[01:51:18] <aaronmcadam> and there's a lot of that out there lol
[01:51:20] <niKnight> some kind of universal patch
[01:51:32] <niKnight> end here, do here.
[01:51:59] <aaronmcadam> it means your code runs in its own sort of "sandbox" for want of a better word
[01:52:10] <aaronmcadam> along with the closure i mean niKnight
[01:52:47] <blackspotwiggins> it's a closure
[01:52:51] <blackspotwiggins> just say what it is
[01:52:59] <Kichael> I've push a bunch of functions into func, and now I'm doing $.when.apply(null, funcs).done blah(), but blah gets executed before the functions are done
[01:53:12] <aaronmcadam> I'm trying to explain it to him blackspotwiggins it's fine
[01:53:13] <xatnySgroW> kromack:   beforeSend: function( xhr , settings)
[01:53:23] <Kichael> checked with a breakpoint in blah()
[01:53:29] <blackspotwiggins> still, use the correct terms
[01:53:37] <aaronmcadam> I am
[01:53:41] <aaronmcadam> don't lecture me please
[01:53:54] <aaronmcadam> Kichael: I think what i wrote was slightly off
[01:54:05] <aaronmcadam> was trying to remember what ajpiano said
[01:54:20] <yan_nick> xec: and why is gallery[60] undefined? http://jsfiddle.net/pswfp/
[01:54:55] <Trisox> what he said she said bull..
[01:55:33] <aaronmcadam> oh god limp bizkit at this time?
[01:55:35] <aaronmcadam> lol
[01:56:07] <Trisox> i think you better quit talking that ...
[01:56:36] <aaronmcadam> I'm lookin at my logs I'll try to find it
[01:56:47] <kromack> Frak I just understood, the error is not about this jQuery code but it relative to the javascript ressource loaded by the ajax method, sorry
[01:56:58] <Trisox> kromack:   beforeSend: function( xhr , settings)
[01:56:59] <Trisox> ?
[01:57:13] <Trisox> ah lol
[01:57:26] <Cork> jqXHR or xhr doesn't matter
[01:57:26] <Trisox> :D
[01:57:30] <Trisox> ah k
[01:57:46] <Trisox> i'm custom to xhr
[01:57:50] <Kichael> thanks
[01:58:02] <aaronmcadam> doesn't matter it's a dynamic language hehe
[01:58:07] <Cork> Trisox: jquery 1.5 doens't give you an xhr object left anymore
[01:58:14] <Cork> s/left/back/
[01:58:21] <Cork> it gives you a jqXHR object
[01:58:23] <Trisox> oh
[01:58:23] <aaronmcadam> yup
[01:58:25] <Trisox> k
[01:58:28] <Trisox> didnt know
[01:58:40] <Cork> ?jqxhr
[01:58:42] <aaronmcadam> what does that mean I've seen that before
[01:58:45] <aaronmcadam> bot-t is down
[01:58:49] <Cork> ah
[01:58:54] <aaronmcadam> s/left/back/
[01:59:06] <Trisox> yea or help in bitter days, tbot
[01:59:13] <Trisox> bot-t
[01:59:17] <Trisox> what ever its name
[01:59:34] <Cork> aaronmcadam: 1.5 adds support for deferre
[01:59:46] <aaronmcadam> yeah yeah I kno that
[01:59:47] <aaronmcadam> I meant
[01:59:49] <aaronmcadam> s/left/back/
[01:59:54] <Cork> ah
[02:00:10] <Cork> aaronmcadam: vi or emac search replace
[02:00:17] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[02:00:27] <Trisox> that's a back alley lefty called little S
[02:00:30] <xec> yan_nick: gallery is not filled until the loop is done, and i wrapped it in a ready event to be able to select the classes.. so it's empty when you do console.log
[02:00:31] <Cork> find left replace it with back
[02:00:34] <Trisox> ;)
[02:00:48] <yan_nick> xec: okay, works in project

[02:01:31] <aaronmcadam> soz dude
[02:01:34] <xec> heheh
[02:01:37] <Kichael> so apply is called on a specific function with an array of arguments
[02:01:43] <aaronmcadam> yes
[02:01:47] <aaronmcadam> call for one arg
[02:01:51] <Trisox> go nuts, go apeshit!
[02:01:53] <aaronmcadam> did u check that pubsub plugin?
[02:02:09] <Kichael> but I need .call called on each of the functions in the array, inside the .when
[02:02:16] <Kichael> ?
[02:02:37] <aaronmcadam> i remember
[02:03:43] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: did it a bit like .when.apply( getJSON(....), getJSON(...), [a,b]); or something like that
[02:04:02] <aaronmcadam> where it looked like a list of funcs and then params
[02:04:09] <aaronmcadam> sorry I can't find what he said in my logs
[02:04:28] <aaronmcadam> i must have closed xchat after he wrote it :(
[02:06:12] <Trisox> set loggin on

[02:15:22] <Trisox> prob is
[02:15:23] <aaronmcadam> probably why it's slow
[02:15:39] <Trisox> i think they should put in in topic

[02:15:50] <aaronmcadam> where u based btw Trisox ?
[02:15:55] <Trisox> netherlands
[02:15:58] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:16:06] <aaronmcadam> uk here but from ireland
[02:16:24] <uchuff> hoi Trisox
[02:16:40] <Trisox> heyz
[02:16:49] <uchuff> hope that's Dutch anyway, if not a bunch of Belgians were messing with me
[02:17:06] <johnline3> hey guys, im having trouble with my slideshow in tabs, it works fine in ie9 and opera, on everything the slideshow jams up on the secondary tabs
[02:17:07] <johnline3> http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/dev/design/
[02:17:11] <aaronmcadam> Kichael: was it u trying the $.whens?
[02:17:37] <kromack> I think my problem is when I'm loading an external javascript ressource via jQuery.ajax, I see in firebug that the returned file contains encoding problems, comments have <?> caracters instead of 'é' 'à' etc, I've added  contentType: "text/javascript; charset=ISO-8859-1", scriptCharset: 'ISO-8859-1', but the probleme still, any idea ?
[02:18:04] <kromack> (original code http://pastebin.com/r3HNSL44)
[02:18:04] <aaronmcadam> Kichael: $.when.apply(null, arrayOfAjaxCalls)
[02:18:11] <blackspotwiggins> kromack, use unicode?
[02:18:21] <__machine> why does $('#form input[type=radio]).click(function(e) { alert('x'); })' result in x being alerted twice for one click on a radio button?
[02:18:30] <uchuff> kromack: generally easier to use utf-8 encoding rather than ISO-8859-1 these days
[02:18:32] <aavikkojootti> seems like u use chars that doesn't belong to your charset
[02:18:36] <aaronmcadam> wow ISO is sooo 2002 or something
[02:18:40] <kromack> Ive tested alos, non changes... And In Eclipse I see that files are encoded into CP1252
[02:18:52] <uchuff> utf-8 handles all the special characters
[02:19:04] <kromack> I know but the whole application is ISO... This is a huge app ^
[02:19:10] <blackspotwiggins> if the file is in cp1252 and you transfer with iso
[02:19:13] <blackspotwiggins> no wonder it doesnt work
[02:19:18] <johnline3> i think my site host doesnt support utf-8
[02:19:19] <johnline3> iirc
[02:19:27] <uchuff> i would be surprised johnline3
[02:19:30] <blackspotwiggins> johnathanb, wtf?
[02:19:35] <blackspotwiggins> sry, johnline3
[02:19:38] <johnline3> is that even possible?
[02:19:48] <Kichael> aaronmcadam, I'm doing that, $.when.apply(null,funcs).then blah()
[02:19:48] <aaronmcadam> they're bullshitting u
[02:19:49] <aaronmcadam> surely
[02:19:49] <blackspotwiggins> do they support file systems?
[02:19:52] <uchuff> kromack: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2904829
[02:19:55] <blackspotwiggins> if yes, they support files
[02:19:59] <Kichael> blah() fires before the others
[02:20:01] <blackspotwiggins> which can be anything you want
[02:20:05] <aaronmcadam> Kichael:  $.when( $.getJSON(), $.getJSON(), $.getJSON() ).then(fn)
[02:20:12] <uchuff> good link about utf-8 for anyone actually that one
[02:20:14] <aaronmcadam> or or $.when.apply(null, arrayOfAjaxCalls)
[02:20:17] <johnline3> this is what i seemed to be stuck on: <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=iso-8859-1" />
[02:20:23] <aaronmcadam> just pasting what adam said :)
[02:20:41] <johnline3> if i set it to utf-8, i would get strange characters at the start of the body
[02:20:59] <aaronmcadam> your issue is?
[02:21:11] <uchuff> is the file written in a text editor or generated by a database?
[02:21:19] <blackspotwiggins> johnline3, it might help if you encode your files in utf-8 as well
[02:21:25] <uchuff> if it's a text editor then open it, change to utf-8 and save
[02:22:02] <johnline3> i think i did, but i am using ssi to inject a nav bar to the top of each of my pages
[02:22:09] <johnline3> maybe thats where its auto encoding it
[02:22:34] <blackspotwiggins> it's like im really in 1997
[02:23:04] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[02:23:17] <johnline3> is there a better method? im all ears
[02:23:38] <blackspotwiggins> any templating engine
[02:24:40] <johnline3> however, this isnt even my main problem atm
[02:24:56] <johnline3> slideshow ^
[02:25:16] <Trisox> just let is slide
[02:25:52] <anli_> Can a js object be serialized and deserialized?
[02:26:37] <blackspotwiggins> anli_, primitive stuff yes
[02:26:44] <blackspotwiggins> json for example
[02:26:59] <anli_> true true
[02:27:04] <anli_> Well, can work
[02:27:27] <Kichael> yeah I don't get it, I'm pushing $.posts into an array, then doing, $.when.apply(null, funcs).then(blah())  and blah is being called first
[02:27:38] <anli_> We have  $.parseJSON
[02:27:44] <anli_> hm
[02:27:54] <anli_> and  $.toJSON, nice
[02:28:03] <anli_> oh, there is no $.toJSON
[02:28:09] <blackspotwiggins> anli_, there is JSON.parse and JSON.stringify
[02:28:12] <blackspotwiggins> as part of core js
[02:28:31] <blackspotwiggins> but you need the special addon plugin expansion thingie to use it with jqueries
[02:28:54] <anli_> not good
[02:29:02] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, i heard its pretty hard to install
[02:29:16] <anli_> It does not have to be hard to be installed to be bad
[02:29:29] <blackspotwiggins> of course
[02:29:44] <blackspotwiggins> who uses js anyway, its all jqueries
[02:29:47] <anli_> jquery should full handle json as it is, shouldnt it?
[02:30:13] <anli_> Hm, maybe I need to use .date after all
[02:30:18] <anli_> eh
[02:30:19] <anli_> .data
[02:30:20] <anli_> hehe
[02:31:07] <Trisox> .data rulez
[02:31:27] <anli_> I dont like it, because I cannot see it in firebug
[02:31:35] <anli_> Maybe I can actually
[02:31:38] <anli_> Never found it
[02:31:43] <uchuff> even with firequery ? (is that still a think?)
[02:31:51] <Cork> anli_: and unless you need support for really old browsers you can use JSON.parse directly
[02:32:11] <Kichael> what's the proper way to push functions into an array?
[02:32:24] <blackspotwiggins> Kichael, push() maybe?
[02:32:35] <blackspotwiggins> just guessing here
[02:32:37] <anli_> Cork: Well, I can always check the browser version
[02:32:58] <anli_> never used firequery
[02:33:03] <blackspotwiggins> anli_, because feature detection is for weaklings right?
[02:33:07] <anli_> hehe
[02:33:07] <Kichael> because when I go push, it's executing the function
[02:33:17] <Cork> anli_: i think $.parseJSON is a wrapper for it so...
[02:33:36] <anli_> would mean that jquery does not support those old browsers
[02:34:11] <Cork> anli_: no a wrapper with a fallback
[02:34:15] <blackspotwiggins> Kichael, if you push functionname() then ofc it executes
[02:34:18] <blackspotwiggins> that's what () do
[02:34:24] <anli_> then the wrapper can be the removed and the fallback use solely
[02:34:31] <anli_> use=be used
[02:35:33] <Cork> anli_: just checked, and sorry
[02:35:46] <Cork> no jquery parseJSON only uses the built in object
[02:35:59] <Cork> so you need json2.js for backwards compatibility
[02:36:41] <anli_> ok
[02:36:47] <anli_> Nothing to be sorry about :)
[02:36:49] <Cork> anli_: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[02:37:03] <anli_> But I dont want to add a lot of plugins if I dont have to
[02:37:06] <Cork> anli_: its what the JSON object in browsers is modeled after :)
[02:37:19] <anli_> I will rather use .data than handle the json and put the string with .attr
[02:37:23] <anli_> Which says a lot
[02:37:50] <Cork> anli_: you can pull the data with .data as long as your naming the attributes correctly
[02:38:02] <James-_> hello
[02:38:03] <Cork> that is prefix your attributes with data-
[02:38:05] <James-_> i need help
[02:38:05] <anli_> yes, but .data is not the most beutyful thing invented
[02:38:10] <anli_> beautiful
[02:38:14] <anli_> hehe
[02:38:17] <James-_> http://pastie.org/2421459
[02:38:17] <James-_> http://pastie.org/2421461
[02:38:17] <James-_> firebug say : disp_error is not defined
[02:38:17] <James-_> disp_error("Le message est trop court");
[02:38:22] <Cork> anli_: whats bad about it?
[02:38:23] <James-_> but jquery is load in head
[02:38:36] <Kichael> blackspotwiggins, how can I push an anonymous function onto an array then?
[02:38:42] <_|Nix|_> Hi! Is there any documentation about the "vmouse*" event parameter? I'm trying to get the x/y coordinates of the event.
[02:38:48] <blackspotwiggins> Kichael, with push().
[02:38:53] <anli_> Cork: Cant find anything good with it :)
[02:39:03] <anli_> Its invisible data to ff
[02:39:05] <anli_> with fb
[02:39:10] <anli_> And its not stored in the DOM
[02:39:17] <Cork> it is
[02:39:17] <anli_> Which I prefer to use as storage
[02:39:20] <anli_> No
[02:39:26] <_|Nix|_> Like, I have canvasSelector.bind( "vmousemove", function (event) { ... } ... inside the braces, how do I get the coordinates from "event"? event.x and event.y?
[02:39:30] <anli_> jquery keeps that data separate from the DOM
[02:39:33] <Cork> <div data-mydata="data">
[02:39:41] <Cork> anli_: if you modify it ya
[02:39:47] <anli_> yes, but that is an attribute
[02:39:48] <Kichael> I'm using .push...
[02:39:53] <Cork> anli_: but thats cause thats recomended
[02:40:10] <Cork> adding things to dom from js is risky and often leaks memory
[02:40:21] <anli_> I dont see how it can leak memory
[02:40:28] <James-_> help me plz
[02:40:43] <Cork> anli_: well its a fack with older browsers
[02:40:51] <Cork> *fact
[02:40:53] <_|Nix|_> OK, found the event object in the jQuery docs ...
[02:41:13] <Kichael> ooooh I think I got it
[02:41:32] <mattyh88> hey, does somebody know why accordion doesn't work in Chrome? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[02:42:33] <ravenzz> it works
[02:42:37] <mattyh88> heh
[02:42:50] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:43:22] <mattyh88> doesn't work here .. does in FF en IE
[02:44:08] <_|Nix|_> OK, I have my answer ...
[02:44:10] <aaronmcadam> Kichael: did you end up naming your funcs instead?
[02:44:51] <Kichael> no, I wasn't declaring them anonymous properly. So now the functions aren't firing and are being pushed properly
[02:45:00] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:45:11] <Kichael> but the .when.apply still fires the then function before the functions in the array
[02:45:16] <anli_> But I use html5
[02:45:16] <anli_> So I will fuck those browsers anyway
[02:45:19] <anli_> The only global I use is $
[02:45:39] <blackspotwiggins> anli_, not jQuery ?
[02:46:07] <anli_> No, I thats a lot of typing, blackspotwiggins
[02:46:14] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[02:46:16] <anli_> :)
[02:46:32] <anli_> oops, its a lot of typing
[02:47:06] <blackspotwiggins> so you name your variables "a", "b" and "x4" to save on typing? ;)
[02:47:11] <anli_> hehe, no
[02:47:43] <anli_> But I dont use  $ for anything else
[02:47:52] <anli_> Cant come up with a really good use for such a variable name
[02:48:36] <aaronmcadam> other libraries can though :)
[02:50:49] <James-_> anyone can help me plz .
[02:50:53] <mekwall> mattyh88: disable all your extensions and try again
[02:51:10] <aaronmcadam> ?g are you awake yet bot-t
[02:51:11] <Kichael> yeah doesn't look like .apply is executing all the functions in the array, just stepped through the execution
[02:51:15] <VolodymyrB> Hi, does jquery supports http streaming ajax?
[02:51:48] <aaronmcadam> is it execing any of em Kichael
[02:52:09] <mekwall> VolodymyrB: jquery doesn't support ajax per se, it implements the browsers capabilities
[02:52:19] <mattyh88> mekwall: i don't have any :)
[02:52:20] <mekwall> VolodymyrB: so, in short. yes :)
[02:52:31] <mekwall> mattyh88: running dev?
[02:52:33] <aaronmcadam> you can decide on the transport
[02:52:55] <Kichael> none
[02:53:10] <aaronmcadam> feck
[02:53:13] <mattyh88> mekwall: the toolbar you get when you click "inspect element"?
[02:53:36] <mekwall> mattyh88: no... if you are running chrome dev version
[02:54:06] <VolodymyrB> mekwall: jquery support?
[02:54:26] <mattyh88> mekwall: crap .. i did have extensions .. the skype one (one that had been installed automatically) :/ problem solved :)
[02:54:29] <Kichael> http://pastie.org/private/ygiqfdciduittzmrb7ibjq here's the js, not sure why the funcs aren't executing now
[02:54:59] <mekwall> mattyh88: extensions is the main culprit of stuff not working in chrome :)
[02:55:17] <mekwall> especially those that mess with the dom
[02:55:21] <mattyh88> mekwall: ok great, thx :)
[02:55:25] <mattyh88> yeh
[02:55:35] <mattyh88> hate it when skype changes phone numbers into the skype style
[02:55:42] <mattyh88> glad i got rid of it
[02:55:45] <uchuff> lol
[02:55:49] <uchuff> ya that's the worst
[02:55:54] <mekwall> I think they made that into an opt-out
[02:56:02] <mekwall> before it wasn't even an opt :D
[02:56:31] <mattyh88> :p
[02:56:42] <Kichael> blackspotwiggins, can you take a look at the pastie and see where I'm going wrong and why those funcs aren't executing?
[02:56:55] <dravekx> anybody good with tabs? I need some help. :S
[02:56:56] <aaronmcadam> Kichael, blackspotwiggins http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/cDbXG/
[02:57:08] <aaronmcadam> k so the funcs are getting in there
[02:57:40] <anli_> mattyh88: Do you know how to code a wepage so that skype doesnt convert phone numbers?
[02:57:54] <aaronmcadam> what's with the return?
[02:58:10] <aaronmcadam> is this all itself in a function Kichael
[02:58:15] <Kichael> yes
[02:58:36] <aaronmcadam> why do u need to return?
[02:58:46] <mattyh88> anli_: no?
[02:58:50] <aaronmcadam> though you'd think that shouldn't matter
[02:58:52] <Kichael> it shouldn't make a difference
[02:59:13] <aaronmcadam> i made ur pastie into a fiddle
[02:59:15] <Kichael> end statement in a function is a return as well
[02:59:18] <blackspotwiggins> Kichael, aaronmcadam all of this could be solved with using regular $.post and ajaxStop event
[02:59:41] <dravekx> I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/37Khy/13/  and I want to make it work with this: http://i.imgur.com/7f3tZ.png I'm not sure how to do this.
[02:59:45] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah actually
[02:59:54] <aaronmcadam> each func is calling the same view
[02:59:56] <VolodymyrB> mekwall: thanks, find http://code.google.com/p/jquery-stream/
[02:59:59] <blackspotwiggins> and
[03:00:02] <Kichael> can I have ajaxStop on only specific ajax calls?
[03:00:04] <blackspotwiggins> using post to get stuff
[03:00:08] <blackspotwiggins> is extremely bad practice
[03:00:12] <aaronmcadam> true
[03:00:20] <aaronmcadam> i only use post for writing data
[03:00:31] <Kichael> are post requests slower?
[03:00:37] <blackspotwiggins> Kichael, isnt the goal do to something after ALL the requests are done?
[03:00:57] <blackspotwiggins> if its for per request, wtf is the big deal, just use callbacks
[03:01:10] <Kichael> well there might be other requests on the page, but you're right, in this case, it's after all of them
[03:01:12] <blackspotwiggins> use of post is ONLY for creating new resources
[03:01:26] <aaronmcadam> GET returns data
[03:02:50] <Kichael> I'll change them to .gets ^.^
[03:02:54] <aaronmcadam> Kichael: why don't you set up your view so it will take an array of categories and return them all together
[03:03:20] <anli_> mattyh88: hm, maybe the phone number just has to be split up a big
[03:03:23] <anli_> bit
[03:04:33] <aaronmcadam> a { [ "category" : "movies", "data" : { ... }, [ "category" : "restaurant", "data" : {} ... ]
[03:04:49] <blackspotwiggins> surely more requests is better
[03:04:53] <blackspotwiggins> more of everything is better
[03:04:57] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:05:20] <mattyh88> anli_: ah .. i'm not gona bother :p .. people should just delete that extension haha
[03:05:39] <Kichael> hmm I'd then just pass an array of params to the request hmm
[03:05:40] <Kichael> good idea
[03:05:53] <aaronmcadam> then you could loop over the parsed JSON and do $('#'+value.category).html(templater( value.data )); Kichael
[03:07:00] <aaronmcadam> I wonder what the star_reco_it func does hehe
[03:07:53] <Kichael> do you want me to tell you or for it to forever remain a mystery?
[03:08:01] <blackspotwiggins> dont tell us
[03:08:02] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:08:08] <blackspotwiggins> dont ever speak of it again
[03:08:16] <Kichael> hah
[03:08:36] <blackspotwiggins> on the next full moon, go to the dark crossroads and spill 3 drops of blood on the ground
[03:08:41] <blackspotwiggins> then our deal is finished.
[03:08:47] <aaronmcadam> weirdo
[03:09:00] <davegarath> Hi all, I have a little problem. I'm trying to exec a item.load of a table but the content don't change. I tried to exec a item.hide() and it works; I tried to get url manually and I cat get content. How can I investigate why my item.load doesn't work ?
[03:09:04] <davegarath> I tried also to add function() { alter('test'); } to my .load but I don't see any alert  :(
[03:09:08] <davegarath> I don't understand where I'm wrong
[03:09:12] <dravekx> anyone want to help me with my tab issue? my js skills suck.
[03:09:21] <DarsVaeda> hi, have a question bout sortables/droppables...I have one, but it is empty, I know there is the "dropOnEmpty" option which I set to true...but I need something to drop the draggable on, how would I do that?
[03:09:45] <aaronmcadam> davegarath: alter?
[03:09:53] <aaronmcadam> have you tried alert?
[03:09:53] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:10:00] <davegarath> ah alert :)
[03:10:06] <aaronmcadam> console.log is your friend
[03:10:21] <aaronmcadam> davegarath: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[03:10:26] <davegarath> yes alert alone works but alert on function in call back on load not wolks :?
[03:10:27] <aaronmcadam> debugging tips
[03:11:31] <davegarath> aaairc:  thanks now I watch them
[03:11:47] <uchuff> on that site, would be awesome if the first push of the right cursor closed the overlay rather than incrementing the first slide. just on the off chance someone here built it
[03:11:55] <aaairc> davegarath: ?
[03:12:03] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano did uchuff
[03:12:27] <aaronmcadam> uchuff: similarly: http://jquerysbestfriends.com/#slide1
[03:12:54] <Kichael> ajaxstop worked
[03:12:54] <aaronmcadam> SlexAxton in here did that site uchuff
[03:12:55] <Kichael> wow
[03:13:04] <Kichael> in like 20 seconds
[03:13:12] <Kichael> and I just spent an hour on that other thing
[03:13:18] <aaronmcadam> great
[03:13:53] <Kichael> cool that ajaxStop targets an element, so it's only stuff inside that element that gets stopped?
[03:14:11] <davegarath> aaairc:  wrong tab :P
[03:16:41] <_bart> I have a large chunk of html, mostly paragraphs and a few headers and images. How do I divide those in pieces (inside a <div>) of maximum 500px height?
[03:19:03] <dravekx> why do jQuery tabs require CSS to work? that's completely stupid
[03:19:44] <blackspotwiggins> dravekx, what?
[03:19:55] <blackspotwiggins> how would you propose it should work then?
[03:20:58] <JKarsrud> dravekx: wtf?
[03:21:00] <dravekx> blackspotwiggins I dont get why it requires CSS. Why can't it use HTML only, and use CSS for styling?
[03:21:12] <JKarsrud> that's what it does?
[03:21:17] <blackspotwiggins> how would that work
[03:21:24] <blackspotwiggins> tabs essentially are styling
[03:21:55] <dravekx> JKarsrud if you remove the CSS here, it doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/37Khy/14/
[03:22:31] <dravekx> or maybe I'm not seeing this :(
[03:22:38] <JKarsrud> dravekx: well, it's kinda hard to hide stuff without CSS isn't it?
[03:22:39] <blackspotwiggins> if you remove wheels from the car, it doesnt work.
[03:22:42] <blackspotwiggins> surprise?
[03:23:06] <r500> any idea where can i find versin 1.4 of jqueryui?
[03:23:13] <dravekx> JKarsrud ahhh. point taken. :)
[03:23:15] <JKarsrud> It's using CSS to hide the siblings of the element at the same index as the selected tab
[03:24:08] <JKarsrud> And just switching between the classes so that they're display: block; again
[03:26:32] <dravekx> JKarsrud cool. I get it now. thx
[03:26:50] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/Mpu7L/1/ -> why can't I drag anything to the empty sortable?
[03:33:38] <r500> dravekx:  http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7663
[03:34:05] <r500> any idea how it can be fixed for now?
[03:36:23] <_bart> why is jsfiddle so slow today :s
[03:36:29] <dravekx> _bart ++
[03:37:26] <DarsVaeda> it is since a few days like that
[03:37:41] <DarsVaeda> seems they need a bigger server
[03:38:23] <_bart> Is there a faster alternative?
[03:38:39] <DarsVaeda> jsbin.com
[03:38:56] <davegarath> aaronmcadam:  reading these slides and using firebug I found a problem in jquery.js line 1858: "if ( typeof jQuery != "undefined" && !jQuery.event.triggered )". But I don't understanding why it stops here :(
[03:39:25] <davegarath> my .load seems simple and stupid
[03:39:28] <_bart> DarsVaeda: that one does not have the ability to add in jquery or does it?
[03:39:39] <DarsVaeda> sure it does
[03:39:56] <DarsVaeda> html -> include
[03:40:21] <_bart> DarsVaeda: ah thanks!
[03:43:21] <PeeterWork> Does .trigger only work with JQuery events?
[03:43:26] <aaronmcadam> yeah there's no problem with jQuery itself
[03:43:33] <aaronmcadam> use the callstack to find out why
[03:43:35] <aaronmcadam> davegarath:
[03:59:55] <aaronmcadam> PeeterWork: what do u mean
[04:00:09] <MariusKarthaus> I'm having trouble with the drag and resize of a dialog() made from an iframe. The iframe captures the mouse events. Is there anyway to fix this ?
[04:00:17] <aaronmcadam> the only "jQuery" events are custom events PeeterWork
[04:07:29] <darkknightcz> hi, is it possible to get url of site inside inframe? (not with src attribute), i tried $("#iframe").contents(), but i cant use it - page is in different domain
[04:09:12] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to query/js and like to build a small dom inspector … first of all I'm trying to get an element on which i click and mark it with a css class http://pastie.org/2421743
[04:09:37] <mightym> but that seems not a good way because of performance + doenst really work ;)
[04:09:59] <mightym> someone a hint how to do that?
[04:10:10] <Behl> If I have a list of divs and I have the ID's of 2 divs in that list. How would I go about retrieving the divs between the 2 divs I have the ID's of?
[04:13:00] <rajakvk> this is cool place
[04:17:01] <mightym> well thx anyway!
[04:24:57] <DarsVaeda> mightym: I'm not an expert and I'm not sure I get what you want to do, but jquery already offers that "$(element).click(function() {//do stuff});"
[04:26:34] <mightym> DarsVaeda: jep, thx for your reply… thats the way I'm trying to do it right now… but this doest work f.e. for all elements on the page … like when you say $('*') or at least $('div')
[04:27:09] <mightym> maybe i should check out how firebug is solving this :)
[04:27:11] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[04:28:34] <Double_Rainbow> i have a selcect box: <option vlaue="1">red</option>
[04:28:49] <Double_Rainbow> if red is slected, how do i get its value?
[04:29:35] <Behl> .value?
[04:29:45] <Double_Rainbow> nopes
[04:30:01] <Behl> How are you selecting it+0
[04:30:03] <Behl> ? *
[04:30:47] <DarsVaeda> it works for me...somehow :D
[04:30:52] <Behl> :)
[04:30:58] <Behl> Double_Rainbow: check out http://api.jquery.com/val/
[04:31:26] <Double_Rainbow> i will get "1", i want the value "red" not "1"
[04:31:36] <Behl> ah
[04:31:53] <Behl> then you want to use .html()
[04:32:30] <DarsVaeda> mightym: http://jsbin.com/akatah/edit#javascript,html,live ^^
[04:32:45] <Double_Rainbow> i tried it also, it gave me all the <options> in the <select> tag
[04:33:30] <Behl> Then you are not targeting the option tag but the select tag.
[04:33:45] <Double_Rainbow> how,
[04:33:50] <Double_Rainbow> how do you do that?
[04:34:12] <Behl> I'm guessing you want the html from the selected option right?
[04:34:21] <uchuff> $("select option:selected").html();
[04:34:23] <Double_Rainbow> right
[04:34:32] <mightym> DarsVaeda: yes, but when you have a more complex page an you'd like to click on a <p> element you might get the complete elements in which the p is nested
[04:34:32] <Double_Rainbow> cool, amma try that
[04:35:34] <formers> or you can use $("select option:selected").text()
[04:36:40] <Double_Rainbow> yeps, works great uchuff, thanks a lot
[04:43:39] <Jammsen> Hi guys
[04:43:58] <Behl> On another note I'm trying select elements after my selected element sharing the same type (like div). .siblings is not doing it. I'm trying an index based selector like :gt(), but it's not giving me anything
[04:45:07] <Behl> Any one who might have a trick to do this?
[04:49:22] <Kimberly> morning all
[04:49:39] <mattyh88> morning? :o
[04:49:44] <mattyh88> cool
[04:49:57] <formers> somewhere in the world its a mornign
[04:50:02] <alabd> Good day all , how to draw graphs with my data in mysql data base?
[04:50:21] <alabd> http://www.geertdedeckere.be/shop/graphup/
[04:50:50] <mattyh88> pretty slick
[04:51:40] <Kimberly> i think this is a simple question how do I specify to jquery where to insert?  If something begins with a letter a, b etc. I would like to specify where it is placed
[04:52:49] <Jammsen> i got a jquery problem, it dont react on the click event in my structure, can anyone help? http://jsfiddle.net/tPmpS/1/
[04:53:18] <Jammsen> i need the alert when someone clicks on the pagination in the footer area
[04:54:28] <mbutubuntu> hello everybody
[04:54:30] <anli_> I want to use div.dialog and use div.width() as width for the dialog, however, width() returns 0, why?
[04:55:05] <mbutubuntu> what is width?
[04:55:10] <formers> Jammsen: you don't have any js/jquery code to react to the click event in the example you have provided
[04:55:12] <mbutubuntu> sorry... what is div?
[04:55:20] <mbutubuntu> an object?
[04:55:49] <formers> div with a class dialog ?
[04:56:26] <alabd> mattyh88: am php programmer and web app is written in php but now want to use those charts , my data is in mysql , should humble read from mysql by php and then give it to jquery ?
[04:56:44] <Jammsen> formers: i got in my version:  $('.np_layer_controlls .innerLeft .pagination .previous').click( function() { alert('jo'); });
[04:56:53] <mbutubuntu> formers, I haven't seen any code... so div could be anything
[04:56:54] <Jammsen> formers: i hit update and run again
[04:57:33] <formers> anli_: do you mean you are doing $('div.dialog').width(); and it is returning 0 ?
[04:57:38] <anli_> mbutubuntu,: Its a div created by using $('<div/>'); although the div is a bit more complicated than that
[04:57:57] <anli_> No, I am trying to get the width of the div before I create the dialog
[04:58:44] <mbutubuntu> anli_, ok
[05:00:34] <formers> Jammeson: your selector is not correct : http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[05:01:54] <detain> is $("#stataccordion>div>table>tbody>tr>td>.ui-buttonset>input:checked").each()     valid ?      can i do that like a    td with an item with .ui-buttonset class directly under it then an input box directly under that ?
[05:03:19] <formers> whoa that's one way to tie you down to your layout
[05:04:58] <impi> helloo
[05:05:43] <mbutubuntu> detain, your selector is too verbose.....
[05:05:48] <impi> i have a question which im not sure of, on my homepage i reload all my data via ajax..and it works fine, but when i am on another page, and i want to use my filter, i would like to redirect the client to the homepage, and then do the ajax call..how will i do that?
[05:05:53] <mattyh88> alabd: yes sounds about tright
[05:05:54] <mbutubuntu> it's slower to resolve
[05:05:55] <mattyh88> *right
[05:06:11] <DarsVaeda> mightym: there is an option for something that can prevent child element to be returned, maybe there is something available for the click event too
[05:06:16] <formers> detain: I don't see an issue with that
[05:06:33] <alabd> mattyh88: slower ?
[05:06:50] <mbutubuntu> slow
[05:07:10] <mbutubuntu> I'd prefer using a class for that element than use $('.thatClass').something();
[05:07:12] <dravekx> stupid fiddle. zzzzzz...
[05:07:28] <mightym> DarsVaeda: thx very much, ill have a look… but don't you thinks its more about preventing parent elements to be returned? (sry I'm not that familiar with such dom things :) )
[05:10:21] <detain> yeah after looking at it it does seem a bit much  .. i just was more curious of the way of doing that would work than the practicality , but thank you for the warning :)
[05:11:08] <mbutubuntu> detain, :-)
[05:11:48] <mattyh88> alabd: what do you mean with slower?
[05:12:07] <alabd> (04:35:54 PM) mbutubuntu: it's slower to resolve
[05:13:48] <mbutubuntu> mattyh88, alabd, I was wrons... it's slow to resolve = javascript takes more time to find the element in the chain... do you think "#stataccordion>div>table>tbody>tr>td>.ui-buttonset>input:checked" is a good selector?
[05:14:14] <formers> definately not
[05:14:23] <mbutubuntu> ok, you agree with me
[05:15:21] <formers> I didn't say I didn't I only said that it would work , a selector like also ties you down to a specific layout which is not a good idea
[05:16:28] <mbutubuntu> formers, ok, it works, but it's not fast
[05:16:39] <formers> yeah agreed
[05:17:11] <alabd> mattyh88: would you give me an example how to give php variable to jquery ? how jquery get it?
[05:20:12] <sadmicrowave> guys, I need some help figuring out what I should be looking for to accomplish a task.  I have a containing div with active horizontal and vertical scrollbars.  I want the container to scroll on mouse drag within the container (not sure how better to describe my goal...)
[05:22:26] <formers> sadmicrowave: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/5VYMD/
[05:22:27] <DarsVaeda> sadmicrowave: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#handle
[05:22:44] <DarsVaeda> I love that nickname :D also this might help?
[05:23:58] <sadmicrowave> formers, yes exactly that, except vertical scrolling is also handled with this
[05:25:20] <impi> sadmicrowave, jquery ui draggables+droppables+sortables
[05:25:45] <dravekx> cool man.
[05:26:03] <dravekx> just need to fix my borders now, and it should be golden: http://jsfiddle.net/he3ut/4/
[05:27:14] <DarsVaeda> (on a sidenote I would prefer monthly and daily swapped ^^)
[05:27:27] <dravekx> monthly first?
[05:27:34] <DarsVaeda> no fuck daily...
[05:27:46] <dravekx> lolz
[05:28:07] <dravekx> I was targetting old married couples.
[05:28:49] <dravekx> idk if its better to use that or use the UI.
[05:31:03] <daveyjoe> How do I insert a variable into a regex match? Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/yrTm2/1/
[05:34:10] <Cork> ?eval var a = 't'; RegExp(a + 'est').test('test')
[05:34:11] <bot-t> Cork: true
[05:34:21] <Cork> daveyjoe: ^
[05:35:03] <Elephant> <3
[05:35:13] <jomofcw> As said Cork it should work daveyjoe
[05:36:10] <daveyjoe> Cork, jomofcw: Hmm, I'm not familiar with the RegExp() syntax, how would that work in my example?
[05:37:21] <Cork> daveyjoe: RegExp(removeThis+'\S','g')
[05:37:36] <Cork> ?mdc regexp @ daveyjoe
[05:37:37] <bot-t> daveyjoe, RegExp - MDN Docs - Creates a regular expression object for matching text according to a pattern. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/regexp
[05:37:55] <daveyjoe> Thanks!
[05:37:56] <jomofcw> daveyjoe it should work you just have a \ to remove in it imo.
[05:40:38] <DarsVaeda> isn't there this selector with wildcards?
[05:40:50] <Cork> sure *
[05:41:32] <mattyh88> someone here has had the double triangle icon bug with the UI Accordion?
[05:43:31] <richardjprice> what would be the most appropriate selector to target multiple a elements on a page?
[05:43:46] <richardjprice> rather not use class
[05:44:09] <hooloovoo> richardjprice: well you could separate with a comma
[05:44:22] <hooloovoo> like this $("#element, .element, input")
[05:45:01] <DarsVaeda> phryk: heisst das nicht "Kumpelblase"?
[05:45:08] <daveyjoe> Cork, jomofcw: Still not working, what am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/yrTm2/2/
[05:45:47] <richardjprice> the scenario: i will have 0 or more links on a page with a link to 'mark this as read', i want to target those links in query, i could obviously do a[class="something"] but i'd rather not use class
[05:46:29] <Cork> daveyjoe: run .toSource() on the generated re
[05:46:38] <Cork> you'll see what regex you have

[05:47:04] <jomofcw> Should not be that xD
[05:47:31] <Cork> ?eval var a = 't'; RegExp(a + 'est').toSource()
[05:47:32] <bot-t> Cork: "/test/"

[05:50:42] <Cork> i'm not sure what you want to generate but theres the regex you have
[05:51:06] <impi> if i do console.log(this) and i get <a class="isnothomepage singleLink" rel="rugby" href="cat=80"> how can i get the class of that? i tried jQuery(this).attr('class') & console.log(this.class); but all says undefined
[05:51:46] <daveyjoe> Cork: I get an Uncaught TypeError. Using Chrome inspector.
[05:51:49] <impi> please help me
[05:52:00] <Cork> daveyjoe: just guessing, but i think this is what you want http://jsfiddle.net/yrTm2/4/
[05:52:30] <Cork> daveyjoe: but you really, Really, REALLY recomend you to use data- attributes instead of overloading classes!
[05:52:50] <Cork> *but i
[05:53:40] <daveyjoe> Cork: Thanks. toSource() still isn't working in my console, but thats the regex that I want
[05:54:05] <Cork> daveyjoe: weird, what browser?
[05:54:53] <sint> hey, i've written some jquery code and it works fine, except for IE. but it works in IE if the developer windows is shown. i kinda puzzled because its hard to trace down the problem if it works in developer mode but not without. anyone having an idea?
[05:56:40] <Cork> sint: check if you have any console calls in your code
[05:58:13] <sint> Cork: ya, thats it! there was one left. thanks allot! :)
[05:58:37] <Cork> np :)
[05:58:52] <sint> Cork: but its strange that all other browsers just ignoring it and still run the code while IE just breaks everything
[05:59:35] <Cork> sint: all other browsers implement a dumy console object
[05:59:38] <Cork> ie doesn't
[06:00:02] <sint> Cork: ah ok. good to know
[06:03:09] <mattyh88> can someone tell me why i'm getting two arrows instead of the single one as shown in the jquery accordion UI example? http://imageshack.us/f/580/accordion.png/

[06:26:08] <buzz_> kurol, Aamir  thnx a bunch ... i'm on it ...
[06:26:09] <kurol> oh hah, i guess that's what most people mean by load event
[06:26:23] <kurol> just woke up
[06:26:36] <leotr> hi! Can't understand what's wrong... http://jsfiddle.net/9sJsT/
[06:27:43] <mattyh88> hm, when you put an accordion div inside a <td> each header in the accordion will show 2 arrows instead of 1
[06:28:49] <kurol> that sounds like a css problem
[06:29:09] <zZzch> can someone help me regex match words "EraserHead" and "Running" in the single line of text, where many other names can appear in following format:"EraserHead","15:03:00, 24/08/2011","Running"
[06:29:13] <mattyh88> kurol: you're talking about my problem?
[06:29:21] <zZzch> it should match no matter the date/time
[06:29:37] <zZzch> but only when date and time are between eraserhead and running
[06:29:37] <kurol> mmm i like that movie
[06:29:39] <zZzch> no other words
[06:29:41] <thepacmanfan> is there a function in Colorbox that would replace Shadowbox's getCurrent?
[06:29:44] <zZzch> yeah it's awesome
[06:30:12] <kurol> i almost have the same hair
[06:33:44] <kurol> you can try /EraserHear.+Running/
[06:36:58] <Augisss> Please look at this: http://pastebin.com/FrFDwXCX
[06:37:10] <Augisss> "Hello" being on the page less than 1 sec
[06:37:12] <Augisss> I want to
[06:37:29] <Augisss> don't disappear "hello"
[06:37:34] <Augisss> whats wrong here: http://pastebin.com/FrFDwXCX
[06:37:34] <Augisss> ?
[06:38:45] <Augisss> ?
[06:40:28] <hariom> How to send query string in .submit()? I am setting form action to newpage.html?id=1 but when it goes to the newpage.html I see that the url doesn't have id=1 query string
[06:40:33] <DarsVaeda> augisss you are sending the form on click thus reloading the page on submit
[06:41:52] <murrrley> Augisss:  remove the form and try <button id="myButton">push</button>
[06:42:25] <murrrley> blah laggy irssi. What DarsVaeda said :)
[06:43:16] <hariom> anybody tried sending quey string in form submit via .submit() ?
[06:44:18] <kborchers> hariom: so you are trying to post to a URL that has a query string?
[06:44:35] <sheepz> hello, I have to make like 12 consecutive ajax requests (each takes like 20 seconds due to an external API), I cannot use a regular while loop because they will be all initiated at the same time
[06:44:40] <sheepz> how do I approach this?
[06:44:58] <hariom> kborchers: yea. method is get
[06:45:35] <kborchers> hariom: if you're doing get, just add the querystring items to your data you're sending via submit since it's all tacked onto the querystring anyway
[06:46:38] <hariom> kborchers: I am dynamically setting action attribute in form along with query string, something like:   action='newpage.html?id=1'  and then calling .submit()
[06:46:58] <hariom> kborchers: but I see that the page changes to newpage.html without querystring in url
[06:47:27] <thepacmanfan> is there a function in Colorbox that would replace Shadowbox's getCurrent?
[06:48:21] <kborchers> hmmm, not sure what you could do. some browsers (IE specifically I believe) don't like querystring vars in the form action for post, they just get stripped. maybe it's the same for get as well
[06:48:24] <Augisss> how i can reload page
[06:48:28] <Augisss> with jquery?
[06:49:42] <kborchers> hariom: why not just have a hidden element in your form called id and then when you update the action just set action to newpage.html and set the hidden element to 1
[06:49:58] <kborchers> then with get id will be added to the query string
[06:50:36] <xec> Augisss: i think you can do it quite easily with plain javascript, try something like: window.location.reload();
[06:50:55] <hariom> kborchers: your earlier msg gave me the same hint. and I guess this is working. :) Thanks
[06:51:02] <kborchers> np
[06:51:41] <buzz_> kurol:  i did .bind() thing but no joy ... :-(
[06:52:33] <hariom> kborchers: Not sure if that is a bug or form element doesn't respect query string if added in 'action'
[06:53:55] <kborchers> i think it's just a browser difference because i know some work but i remember having issues with IE. which doesn't mean it's a bug ... it's just IE :p
[06:56:48] <buzz_> Aamir:  to do the same thing as u suggested above, can we do it on 1 line like the original snippet   >>>   $('select.location_auto_country:not(.location-processed)', context).change(function(e) { ... }
[06:57:36] <Aamir> ?demo @buzz_
[06:57:36] <bot-t> buzz_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:58:24] <buzz_> Aamir:  ok, yes sry about that ... doing now ... thnx ...
[07:01:05] <noob> anybody home?
[07:01:29] <jimXL> A few
[07:01:54] <kborchers> ?ask @ noob
[07:01:55] <bot-t> noob, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:02:16] <DarsVaeda> lol thats funny in combination with that nick
[07:02:19] <noob> i asked it 3 times kborchers
[07:02:34] <noob> can any one have a look at this    http://jsfiddle.net/Dxsuq/10/   i am trying to bind the contextmenu box to right click
[07:04:10] <dabear> noob:
[07:04:14] <dabear> Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[07:04:14] <dabear> fiddle.jshell.net:23Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'contextMenu' of null
[07:04:27] <kborchers> noob: maybe if your fiddle was in some sort of working state for those of us who have never seen or used the contextMenu plugin, we might be able to help. basically what you are saying with that fiddle is can you write my code for me
[07:06:35] <noob> okay maybe ... but i dont know much hence just trying out things... i was following this simple example http://www.trendskitchens.co.nz/jquery/contextmenu/ it should have worked
[07:09:04] <noob> that site does not show anything more
[07:10:02] <noob> so i dont know if i was asking you to write anything to that fiddle, i have already included the contextmenu file...i think you might have already noticed it as you guys are not noob
[07:10:04] <noob> :D
[07:12:58] <christo_m> hi, im trying to implement toggle in a sidebar nav, but i want it so that at most one item can be toggled.
[07:13:07] <christo_m> slidetoggle
[07:15:02] <kborchers> noob: if you would have looked at the errors your code was throwing you would have seen that you didn't include jQuery in your fiddle. also, you can't wrap a td in a span. http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Dxsuq/14/
[07:19:33] <noob> kborchers sorry but there is no such page
[07:19:59] <alabd> mattyh88:  we were talking about using http://www.geertdedeckere.be/shop/graphup/ with php and mysql , humble told should we  read from mysql by php and then give it to jquery ? you told about right , would you explain more about how to give  mysql data to GraphUp Plugin ?
[07:21:22] <noob> http://jsfiddle.net/Dxsuq/15 should be there number 14 dont know for some strange reaon is not there
[07:21:27] <buzz_> Aamir:  it's not a working demo, but i have detailed the issue here and it's got the full code that is needed to work on   >>>   http://jsfiddle.net/wnBe3/
[07:22:58] <noob> can you do another update kbroachers?
[07:22:58] <uchuff> anyone have a recommendation for a syntax highlighter? e.g. for embedding sample code (PHP, JavaScript) in a web page
[07:23:34] <Aamir> buzz_: ask someone else, sorry no idea about this code. Not sure any body can help you with this code :(
[07:24:39] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with buzz
[07:25:52] <buzz_> Aamir:  nop ... but all u really need to look at is the first line of code that has the "change" event i believe ... but thnx for looking ...
[07:26:20] <buzz_> aaronmcadam:  dunno ... can u help me ... ?
[07:26:34] <matt_ims> I'm attempting to attach a click event to a bunch of links, but no dice.  The jq selector returns 38 objects, ($(...).length), but the click event never attaches.  http://jsfiddle.net/wAL4e/
[07:26:55] <noob> i actually wanted it in the whole cell
[07:27:01] <noob> hence was including td
[07:27:04] <aaronmcadam> if you can explain what you want simply
[07:27:15] <aaronmcadam> mere mortal :P
[07:27:43] <ndss56> how to check if something exists eg. i want to check if this exists for example. <p class="foo"></p>
[07:27:44] <kborchers> noob: sorry was afk for a bit
[07:28:13] <noob> yeah no worries
[07:28:16] <buzz_> aaronmcadam:  he he ... sure ... i have the issue explained in details in the comment and the full code snip is also here   >>>   http://jsfiddle.net/wnBe3/
[07:28:24] <noob> i was actually tryin it for the whole cell
[07:28:30] <noob> i will try with div then
[07:28:44] <kborchers> noob: you need to understand how that plugin/jQuery work before using it. you just need to select the cell then http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Dxsuq/16/
[07:29:13] <buzz_> aaronmcadam:  if thats not well explained i can try again here perhaps ... ?
[07:29:21] <aaronmcadam> yea
[07:29:24] <aaronmcadam> explain here too
[07:29:39] <aaronmcadam> don't expect people to always read your comments, just a tip :)
[07:29:45] <dabear> matt_ims: you have a syntax error in your code. you are doing $.post(foo: bar) when you should be doing $.post({foo:bar})
[07:30:57] <ndss56> how to check if something exists eg. i want to check if this exists for example. <p class="foo"></p>
[07:31:10] <matt_ims> dabear: ahh, i missed that.  its corrected now. event is still not firing...
[07:32:19] <carbonhat> Hi everyone! I'm looking for a jQuery-based CSS Style Builder, similar to: http://www.cssportal.com/css-style-editor/ --- I would just use the code from that link, but it's a MESS -- does anyone know of alternatives?
[07:32:59] <orplac> quick question: when selecting child elements, will the selector select all specified elements regardless of how nested they are?
[07:33:04] <aaronmcadam> buzz_: that's a lot to ask
[07:33:19] <ndss56> how to check if this HTML tag exists eg. <p class="foo"></p>
[07:33:32] <orplac> e.g. you have a div element with these children: <tr><td><td>... so on so forth
[07:33:56] <orplac> if i called the selector in the div: $("div > td")
[07:34:06] <orplac> will it select those td's underneath the tr?
[07:34:17] <kborchers> orplac: child elements are one level down. you would want $("div td")
[07:34:43] <orplac> alright, so just avoid suing the > selector and directly call for all td
[07:34:56] <orplac> all td's under a specified div
[07:34:57] <orplac> *&
[07:35:19] <kborchers> unless you don't want td's that might be even deeper, then you would need a different selector
[07:35:37] <aaronmcadam> maybe an n selector
[07:35:38] <orplac> mkay, i think i have a way around selecting too many
[07:35:57] <orplac> could just check for specific css qualifiers
[07:36:01] <orplac> which i have to do anyways
[07:36:06] <noob>  is this syntax correct to increast left margin  ?  'marginLeft': "+=50px";
[07:36:13] <buzz_> aaronmcadam:  i typed it there so it's easy to read just above that code but nop, i'll type here again for u   >>>   i have an autocomplete field (state) tied to a Country select list ... now that code for the autocomplete only fires if we manually do a selection from the Country dropdown list ... the event the autocomplete is listening on is "change" in that code ... but I'd like it to fire if we already have a Country pre-selected 
[07:36:58] <aaronmcadam> noob that won't work don't think
[07:37:08] <aaronmcadam> you don't need the px
[07:37:18] <buzz_> aaronmcadam:  does that make it clearer perhaps ... ?
[07:37:27] <ndss56> how to check if this HTML tag exists eg. <p class="foo"></p>
[07:37:37] <aaronmcadam> 'marginLeft' : $(this).css('margin-left');
[07:37:50] <aaronmcadam> 'marginLeft' : +$(this).css('margin-left') + 50;
[07:37:50] <kborchers> ndss56: $("p.foo").length
[07:38:17] <aaronmcadam> not sure if margin-left returns a number or not
[07:38:42] <carbonhat> pretty sure margin-left will return px -- like 50px
[07:38:45] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: pretty sure you'll get the px with that but you can just parseInt it
[07:38:55] <aaronmcadam> yeah just saw
[07:38:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:39:13] <aaronmcadam> wrap parseInt round that noob
[07:39:35] <aaronmcadam> I'm too used to just using the + operator when I know the string can only be a number
[07:39:44] <carbonhat> 'marginLeft' : parseInt( $(this).css('margin-left') ) + 50 + 'px'
[07:39:45] <ndss56> kborchers: length = 0 means not found?
[07:39:47] <matt_ims> dabear: got it.  thanks for your help... few syntax errors...
[07:39:58] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to add px carbocation
[07:39:58] <carbonhat> or something like that
[07:40:01] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to add px carbonhat
[07:40:16] <carbonhat> really? how does it know it's not em?
[07:40:21] <buzz_> aaronmcadam:  maybe the comment seems like i'm asking someone to do it ... my bad, i can do it if u will help me with some hints ...
[07:40:37] <aaronmcadam> good point carbonhat
[07:40:45] <kborchers> ndss56: yes, and since 0 resolves to false, you can just say if($("p.foo").length){exists)}else{not exists}
[07:41:07] <aaronmcadam> hang on, it might be just for widths and height where u don't need to
[07:41:18] <aaronmcadam> or it might set it to px by default carbocation
[07:41:20] <aaronmcadam> dammit
[07:41:25] <aaronmcadam> carbonhat even again
[07:41:26] <ndss56> kborchers: good boy for helping me.
[07:41:31] <carbonhat> aaronmcadam -- yeah, I know some things default to px...but i'm not going to test them all. :)
[07:41:36] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:41:39] <Sonderblade> kborchers: evaluates :)
[07:41:52] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:42:00] <aaronmcadam> don't correct the master :P
[07:42:00] <carbonhat> when I'm having a margin-left issue, then I'll test whether or not I need to add px
[07:42:20] <kborchers> Sonderblade: my bad ... i was strugging on that word and just picked one .. you are right
[07:42:21] <aaronmcadam> it's not a huge deal
[07:42:29] <buzz_> aaronmcadam:  the autocomplete needs a tweak to work on page load i believe, such that it will fire regardless of what value the Country select has as well as on the "change" event ...
[07:42:41] <kborchers> it got the point across though ;)
[07:42:53] <noob> okay... none of them worked though :P
[07:43:07] <noob> http://jsfiddle.net/Dxsuq/18/
[07:43:30] <buzz_> aaronmcadam:  and it wud be nice, if it checks that the Country select option value is not empty "" ...
[07:43:44] <aaronmcadam> kborchers: any ideas on buzz_?
[07:43:58] <kborchers> haven't been paying attention
[07:44:02] * kborchers reads up
[07:44:05] <aaronmcadam> cool :)
[07:44:55] <noob> http://jsfiddle.net/Dxsuq/18/  aaronmacadam the left margin things not working here...if you try commenting it out in this one
[07:45:06] <buzz_> kborchers:  thnx aaronmcadam ... shud i post again for u ... ?  btw, here's the fiddle  >  http://jsfiddle.net/wnBe3/
[07:46:04] <sphinxxx> is sliding divs left/right easy to do without a plugin?
[07:46:12] <carbonhat> so nobody knows of a nice, clean-sourced, jQuery based alternative to this monster: http://www.cssportal.com/css-style-editor/ ?
[07:46:14] <sphinxxx> like a signup form, where each step it slides to the next div
[07:46:24] <JesperA> sphinxxx, yes, real easy
[07:46:30] <aaronmcadam> yea
[07:46:34] <JesperA> its one of the baked in funktion in jquery ffs
[07:46:46] <sphinxxx> should i be using <ul> ?
[07:46:53] <sphinxxx> and a div within each <li> ?
[07:46:58] <kborchers> buzz_: can't you just check the val() on dom ready and if not "" fire .change() on the select? or did i miss something?
[07:47:06] <buzz_> kborchers:  the autocomplete needs a tweak to work on page load i believe, such that it will fire regardless of what value the Country select has as well as on the "change" event that it already fires on currently ... that's the gist of the issue ... thnx for looking ...
[07:48:39] <buzz_> kborchers:  umm can we do that inside of this code snip perhaps ... ?
[07:49:48] <aaronmcadam> sphinxxx: yeah dude
[07:50:41] <kborchers> buzz_: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/wnBe3/1/
[07:51:25] <kborchers> buzz_: if your current code is in a document.ready, ad that code after you do your change binding
[07:52:01] <buzz_> kborchers:  chking now ... thnx a bunch man ...  :-)
[07:52:33] <ries> gents, I have a page with a lot of popups, and each popup shows a different image. Currently each popup is added using a hidden div, so the content is not fetched with a ajax request. Now when the page loads, the browsers loads all images of all hidden popups. What technique is available to load the image only when the popup is actually shown?
[07:52:52] <kborchers> buzz_: though looking at your code, you add the location-processed class after you bind so you probably need to take that out of my selector so just var select = $('select.location_auto_country');
[07:55:36] <buzz_> kborchers:  ok ... gotcha ... thnx again ... yes, this code is in a standalone JS file ... there are other places with document.ready ... so ima add the contents of ur document.ready snip there ... lemme get on it and test ... :-)
[07:55:58] <buzz_> kborchers++
[07:56:20] <sadmicrowave> where can I find a list of css -moz prefix property values?
[07:56:39] <buzz_> google ?
[07:56:43] <sadmicrowave> lol
[07:56:49] <j_wright> devmo?
[07:57:04] <buzz_> heh ... googles got plenty of lists ...
[07:57:27] <zoned> has anyone ever done anything with jqueryMobile? i'm trying to find a way to create a floating navigation bar that would be static across all pages, can anyone help?
[07:57:41] <sadmicrowave> buzz, I search for 'css -moz' or anything of the sort and it just brings back pages about css
[07:57:50] <j_wright> sadmicrowave: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS_Reference/Mozilla_Extensions
[07:58:02] <j_wright> which i got from https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS
[07:58:25] <aaronmcadam> css3please @ sadmicrowave
[07:58:39] <kborchers> ries: why not just dynamically create/destroy those hidden divs with their images as the popup is needed. then the image won't load until it's viewed. you would just need to know what image they are trying to see when you create the "popup"
[07:59:40] <ries> kborchers: I do 'know' everything.. so it wouldn't be a problem, but do you mean create some java array with the content and then create the dom nodes when it needs to be viewed?
[07:59:47] <uchuff> anyone have a suggestion for a syntax highlighter? I was using JQuery Chili but it's been buggy recently and doesn't look actively developed. Snippet seems good (http://www.steamdev.com/snippet/)
[08:00:47] <gar_onn> I'm using e.srcElement.tagName == "INPUT" to check if my keydown bind is fired from an input field or not, is this reliable?
[08:00:58] <sphinxxx> whats a really lightweight content slider plugin, that allows for calling nextslide and prevslide ?
[08:01:05] <kborchers> ries: how are you creating your "popups", UI dialog, something else?
[08:01:23] <ries> kborchers: currently just a hidden div below each 'link' then I show that using a popup plugin
[08:01:29] <sadmicrowave> j_wright, thanks
[08:01:49] <ries> uchuff: beautyofcode does a good job for me
[08:02:07] <uchuff> hah, i actually have that page open right now ries
[08:02:12] <uchuff> do you know if you can turn the line numbers off?
[08:02:19] <uchuff> just looking through the docs
[08:02:37] <ries> kborchers: May be I can do a <img src="onepix.gif" showsrc="my/image/url/needstoload.jpg" /> then I move showsrc to src when the popup is shown?
[08:02:52] <kborchers> ries: so what I would do is link each a to the image itself (that way no JS, no problem), then bind to the click event of those links and create your popups in there.
[08:02:56] <ries> uchuff: No, I just use it pretty much in the default state for some bash examples
[08:03:15] <ries> kborchers: I will give that a though…. thanks for the suggestion
[08:03:36] <uchuff> noGutter: true
[08:03:37] <uchuff> pwn
[08:03:43] <uchuff> will give that a bash ries, looks good
[08:03:46] <kborchers> ries: then in your handler, just make sure to preventDefault() so that the link doesn't load the image
[08:04:06] <uchuff> line numbers make no sense for what i'm doing as it's just rough example snippets
[08:04:10] <uchuff> so i'm turning them off
[08:04:42] <ries> kborchers: I will read upon that…. I am not so much of a JS guru… but learning :)
[08:05:06] <kborchers> ?preventDefault @ ries
[08:05:06] <bot-t> ries, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[08:13:01] <sphinxxx> anyone? looking for a good recommendation for a lightweight slider plugin
[08:13:14] <sphinxxx> that has methods for calling next/prev slides

[08:26:22] <bot-t> davegarath, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:26:59] <davegarath> ?
[08:27:15] <Cork[home]> davegarath: i need to see the code to understand what goes wrong
[08:27:41] <davegarath> ok just 2 min and I paste them on pastebit
[08:27:57] <Cork[home]> davegarath: keep it on a site where it can be run though
[08:31:42] <webPragmatist> any of you using anythingslider… i'm not sure how to use it on a collection of items
[08:31:48] <webPragmatist> like all sliders of class .foo
[08:32:13] <davegarath> Cork[home]:  http://jsfiddle.net/JVM9D/ This is my fisrt time that I use this site I dont'know how paste better my code
[08:32:59] <davegarath> when I get my url in .load the results is the content in tbody
[08:44:02] <Cork[home]> davegarath: http://jsfiddle.net/JVM9D/4/
[08:44:10] <Cork[home]> wfm at least
[08:44:29] <Cork[home]> (load is just an ajax call followed by a html call)
[08:45:48] <davegarath> Cork[home]:  ?
[08:46:09] <Cork[home]> davegarath: it means, i can't reproduce the problem with the information you've given
[08:46:48] <Cork[home]> davegarath: try something like validating the html so its not something like that
[08:47:26] <davegarath> Cork[home]:  I have that html and that function
[08:47:30] <davegarath> http://jsfiddle.net/JVM9D/1/
[08:47:51] <enjoycrf> u guys ever have an elusive issue
[08:48:07] <davegarath> the result of my get for .load : ?sort=host_name&reverse&ajax for example
[08:48:16] <Cork[home]> davegarath: ya, and its what i've used in http://jsfiddle.net/JVM9D/4/ wfm (Works For Me)
[08:48:36] <davegarath> returns html like this
[08:48:44] <davegarath> wait
[08:48:54] <Cork[home]> put the html in the pb
[08:48:55] <Cork[home]> not here
[08:49:42] <davegarath> http://jsfiddle.net/JVM9D/5/
[08:49:52] <davegarath> of course
[08:50:10] <davegarath> if the html returned from my url is like this it woks
[08:51:18] <davegarath> if the html returned is like this : http://jsfiddle.net/JVM9D/7/ it doesn't work
[08:51:42] <davegarath> if there is a table inside a td the load fails :(
[08:53:59] <Cork[home]> davegarath: http://jsfiddle.net/JVM9D/8/
[08:54:05] <Cork[home]> still wfm
[08:54:37] <Cork[home]> i think the problem is somewhere else then related to talbe
[08:56:51] <davegarath> wfm too writed here but if this html was returned from the server it doesn't wok :(
[08:57:00] <davegarath> html is the same
[08:57:20] <Cork[home]> davegarath: it is returned from the server
[08:57:23] <davegarath> if I remove table from my td it works
[08:57:45] <Cork[home]> the last example does loads the html from the jsfiddle echo ajax callback
[08:58:02] <Cork[home]> so it emulates the exact same situation
[08:59:15] <CKIDOW> hi
[08:59:19] <Cork[home]> davegarath: the only thing i can think of is the fact that you don't have any url in your request
[08:59:21] <davegarath> mmm maybe this is because I used a table with one field for semplicity in my case the table have 7 fields for 300 rows
[08:59:34] <Cork[home]> davegarath: not likly
[08:59:57] <Cork[home]> davegarath: but give it a go and send a reduced test case
[09:00:00] <davegarath> and I obtain an alert from my brower that say me that jquery don't respond and I have to termintate it
[09:00:46] <davegarath> finally the page was rendered but my browser almost die
[09:01:24] <davegarath> if I remove the table in td I don't have any problem
[09:01:45] <Cork[home]> well you would have to test it your self, cause i don't see it here
[09:02:13] <Cork[home]> if you have anything i can test on thats another matter
[09:02:17] <MaSch_> whats faster?  $('selector', parent) or $(parent).find('selector')  ?
[09:02:29] <Cork[home]> MaSch_: same
[09:02:42] <MaSch_> Cork[home]: thx
[09:02:48] <Cork[home]> MaSch_: the first is just a shorthand for the second
[09:03:07] <davegarath> Cork[home]:  I'll try to expose my server so you can see it
[09:05:48] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, how to manage separately background-position (x,y) with .animate? using .animate({backgroundPosition: xx, xx}, time) doesn't work
[09:07:44] <Cork[home]> mbutubuntu: 'x y'
[09:07:57] <mbutubuntu> Cork[home], it doesn't work
[09:08:05] <mbutubuntu> oh sorry, with singlequotes?
[09:08:14] <Cork[home]> dubble or single doesn't matter
[09:08:30] <Cork[home]> but it might be that animate doesn't support background-position
[09:09:15] <mbutubuntu> Cork[home], it doesn't work... the Y is set before the animation... I think it's impossible :-)
[09:09:58] <mbutubuntu> in other words: y is static
[09:10:29] <Cork[home]> mbutubuntu: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/backgroundPosition-Effect
[09:10:50] <kinesis> how do i inject a variable into : function(data) {$("#<variable here>")  as in the div i want to mess with is dynami
[09:10:57] <kinesis> #{variable}
[09:11:09] <Cork[home]> mbutubuntu: oh wait a min
[09:11:19] <kborchers> kinesis: $("#"+<variable here>)
[09:11:36] <kinesis> so $("#"+foo)
[09:11:39] <Cork[home]> mbutubuntu: try backgroundPosition: '(xx yy)'
[09:11:43] <kborchers> yep
[09:11:52] <kborchers> if foo is an id
[09:11:59] <Cork[home]> mbutubuntu: but don't forget to add things like px and the like
[09:12:08] <mbutubuntu> Cork[home], just tried
[09:12:17] <Brodingo> ?g css hooks background position jquery
[09:12:18] <bot-t> Brodingo, cssHooks in jQuery 1.4.3  Petersen Did It - http://blog.petersendidit.com/post/csshooks-in-jquery-1-4-3/
[09:13:08] <mbutubuntu> Cork[home], I've tried everything... also an object {'Xpx', 'Ypx'}... but it doesn't work
[09:13:09] <Brodingo> https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/bgpos.js
[09:13:16] <Brodingo> mbutubuntu ^
[09:13:20] <Cork[home]> mbutubuntu: so you need the plugin
[09:13:26] <mbutubuntu> ok
[09:13:35] <mbutubuntu> but I don't like overhead :-)
[09:14:15] <Cork[home]> mbutubuntu: so merge it to one big js then
[09:14:33] <mbutubuntu> Cork[home], I know... I'll try that plugin
[09:14:38] <mbutubuntu> now I have to go...
[09:14:44] <mbutubuntu> thank you guys
[09:34:24] <orplac> anyone good with jqGrid?
[09:36:15] <zoned> i'm developing a simple jqueryMobile site... i understand each 'page' is in a container with header, content, and footer. what i would like is to be able to create the header/footer outside of each page, rather than copying that code 12 times for each of my pages. is this possible?
[09:44:46] <CKIDOW> hi
[09:47:09] <zoned> i don't think anyone's here today
[09:47:43] <sphinxxx> srsly
[09:49:04] <zoned> forizzlmnizzl
[09:56:29] <djQuery> wazup
[09:57:58] <zoned> i'm developing a simple jqueryMobile site... i understand each 'page' is in a container with header, content, and footer. what i would like is to be able to create the header/footer outside of each page, rather than copying that code 12 times for each of my pages. is this possible?
[09:58:27] <kinesis> is it like this:     $.post("doQuery.php", {Query:value,Field:name}, function(data) {  or like this: $.post("doQuery.php", {Query:value}, {Field:name}, function(data) {
[09:58:47] <zoned> kinesis, don't use .post. use .ajax instead.
[09:59:04] <kinesis> im still new and don't understnd how to implement that
[09:59:21] <kinesis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSAbp_4ACaw <- im making something like this
[09:59:26] <kinesis> how does .ajax fit into that
[09:59:37] <zoned> kinesis, http://tinyurl.com/3vbb79r
[10:00:05] <kinesis> uh no need to be a smart ass
[10:00:14] <zoned> :)
[10:00:14] <kinesis> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ <- was more relevant
[10:00:35] <kinesis> ill conver tit later
[10:00:43] <kinesis> for now just need POC for bossman
[10:01:11] <djQuery> kinesis: by the way .post just calls .ajax
[10:01:32] <zoned> $.ajax({type:'POST', url:'.LINK TO PHP FILE', data:{}, async:TRUE OR FALSE, complete:function(data) { // your function here, data is the object returned
[10:01:56] <zoned> inside data:{} you pass it your args
[10:02:03] <kinesis> what is async: (im reading about it)
[10:02:15] <kinesis> async, default true..
[10:02:39] <kinesis> synchronious requests may lock the browser
[10:03:14] <djQuery> kinesis: see ?ui.autocomplete
[10:03:15] <bot-t> kinesis, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[10:03:30] <zoned> kinesis:
[10:03:36] <zoned> $.ajax({type:'POST', url:'./doQuery.php', data:{'Query':value, 'Field':name}, async:async, complete:function(data) {
[10:04:56] <kinesis> the autocomplete is tight, and similar to what im trying to accomplish, but im using PHP/MySQL
[10:05:02] <kinesis> not a predefined list of variables
[10:05:19] <kborchers> kinesis: you can use external data sources for autocomplete
[10:05:27] <djQuery> kinesis: so look at the other examples. they have an example for external data.
[10:05:29] <kinesis> yeah i think so
[10:06:24] <brianpWins> If i goto one of my jquery mobile pages directly. Everything looks fine. but when the page is accessed via ajax (jquerymobile transitions) 2 of my form fields get doubled inside themselves. has anyone seen this before?
[10:07:46] <djQuery> brianpWins: link?
[10:08:18] <brianpWins> i could do a screen cap but otherwise it's local
[10:12:46] <DyeA> Am i missing something? I can't animate an element from a filtered jquery set  i.e. $(marEl).filter(':visible').animate('opacity', 0, 300); won't work
[10:12:58] <DyeA> I can return it into a variable and then animate that
[10:13:03] <DyeA> but i can't just chain it
[10:14:16] <DyeA> correct line is 				$(marEl).filter(':visible').animate({opacity: 0}, 300);
[10:15:47] <donburks> DyeA: Have you looked at what comes back from $(marEl).filter(':visible')?
[10:16:08] <DyeA> yeah its a query el
[10:16:11] <DyeA> jquery
[10:16:47] <fris> when using animate to scroll to a position, what would be the best way to implment using the back on the browser to return it to theprevious position?
[10:16:48] <DyeA> i think its working now, i have a ton of shit coming in on this page (not my code) not sure but now it seems to be working
[10:18:47] <DyeA> fris:there are state management js libraries
[10:19:47] <donburks> fris: Hash change events are what you want to go after.
[10:20:27] <chrisinajar> I'm struggling to use add correctly... Why doesn't this work? var myDiv = $('<div />', {text: "lawl"}); $("#athing").add(myDiv);
[10:21:03] <donburks> chrisinajar: What are you trying to do? Add that div to the page?
[10:21:10] <chrisinajar> yup
[10:21:10] <donburks> Or add it to that element, rather?
[10:21:13] <donburks> .append()
[10:21:16] <chrisinajar> into that element
[10:21:17] <donburks> .add() just builds an array.
[10:21:57] <chrisinajar> cool, thanks!
[10:22:00] <donburks> NP
[10:22:12] <Bjornet> hi
[10:22:52] <Bjornet> I want to hide some text when the site loads
[10:23:33] <Bjornet> I dunno how to do this when I dont have any selectors such as <p> elements etc. Any ideas
[10:23:56] <kborchers> Bjornet: display: none; ?
[10:24:27] <Bjornet> yep, but i wanna scan the page for a ceirtan type of text.. can do that with a regex
[10:24:48] <donburks> Bjornet: Anytime you have a problem that you think requires a regex...you now have two problems.
[10:24:52] <Bjornet> now I recive an array of  lets say 10 objects
[10:25:09] <Bjornet> ok
[10:25:28] <Bjornet> I did not mean obejects I mean strings in array
[10:25:55] <Bjornet> @donburks what are those?
[10:26:45] <donburks> Bjornet: It's humour. It's meant to point out that regexp's typically are a tool people reach for when something else will work just as well and with less chance of either nervous breakdown or error.
[10:27:52] <Bjornet> ^^ ok ok.. eee... the breakapart is getting closer
[10:28:31] <donburks> Bjornet: Why can't you put this text inside of a DOM element like a <span>?
[10:29:44] <Bjornet> mm.. I might be able to do that.. then i can reach them.. good idea
[10:30:17] <Bjornet> but allways nice to handle things in a new way..
[10:30:29] <Bjornet> especially for a newbie ^^
[10:34:37] <donburks> Bjornet: Learn to walk first. Then you can start running with gazelles.
[10:34:48] <Bjornet> ^^
[10:34:48] <donburks> There's no sense is making something harder than it needs to be.
[10:34:50] <Bjornet> haha
[10:34:55] <Bjornet> true
[10:34:59] <Bjornet> tnx
[10:35:02] <donburks> Np
[10:42:45] <sadmicrowave> .seen formers
[10:42:46] <hsbot> formers was seen 4 hours, 35 minutes and 12 seconds ago, in #jquery, saying: Augiss: $("#myButton").click(function(){$("#header").html("hello);});
[10:45:38] <sadmicrowave> bot-t, tell formers I made the drag/scroll functionality into a plugin and made some changes so it would work with Y axis scrolling also: http://pastebin.com/NNvhyVbC
[10:45:39] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, Okay.
[10:48:57] <DyeA> i thought the animate function ran asynchronously meaning i could crossfade two images by animating the first and then on the next line animating the second, doing this it is apparent it doesn't work. Whats the workaround to cross fade?
[10:49:32] <kborchers> DyeA: you need to set the queue option to false in animate
[10:50:01] <kborchers> ?animate
[10:50:02] <DyeA> ahhhhh is that recent? i did a bunch of animation a year ago and don't remember having to do that
[10:50:02] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[10:50:55] <DyeA> bot-t: yep i get the syntax. whats the point?
[10:50:56] <bot-t> DyeA, Cannot predict now.
[10:50:56] <kborchers> i think it's been around a while but i could be wrong
[10:50:57] <enjoycrf> hey
[10:51:08] <kborchers> ?imabot @ DyeA
[10:51:08] <bot-t> DyeA, -5 geek points for not noticing I am a bot.
[10:51:11] <enjoycrf> im using the word wrap func
[10:51:32] <enjoycrf> but if  u pass a lower value than the length of the first word
[10:51:37] <enjoycrf> it doesnt wrap
[10:51:54] <enjoycrf> because it doesnt split letters only words
[10:52:02] <DyeA> Ooo i get the ?property syntax
[10:52:23] <enjoycrf> any way to find pos of the first space?
[10:52:26] <DyeA> thanks kborchers! although its not showing a queue argument in the explanation
[10:52:37] <enjoycrf> like strpos(' ')
[10:52:42] <enjoycrf> or something
[10:52:53] <kborchers> DyeA: it's an option
[10:53:06] <DyeA> goes in a map with the duration eh
[10:53:31] <kborchers> enjoycrf: str.indexOf(' ')
[10:53:38] <DyeA> duration, easing, and queue are in one map and callback is a third arg looks like
[10:53:41] <kborchers> DyeA: yep
[10:53:45] <enjoycrf> thx
[10:53:51] <enjoycrf> forgot about that one lol
[10:53:54] <DyeA> kborcher: thanks much!
[10:53:57] <kborchers> np
[10:54:28] <enjoycrf> ppl always use indexof for otherthings
[10:54:43] <enjoycrf> but its intended use
[10:55:55] <DyeA> there should be a delay option there too, i.e. instead of false what about delay for x number of seconds
[10:56:34] <DyeA> ahh the old .delay() is it lol
[10:56:49] <enjoycrf> if (br < space) br = space;
[10:56:50] <enjoycrf> lol
[10:57:06] <enjoycrf> u get what im doing haha
[10:57:16] <enjoycrf> this is so annoying
[10:58:47] <kborchers> DyeA: you could just use queue: false and a setTimeout on the one you want to start later. delay() only works with the queue i believe so it will finish first anim, then delay, then do second.
[10:59:06] <enjoycrf> omfg
[10:59:18] <enjoycrf> this wordwrap function is worthless
[10:59:34] <enjoycrf> now if i pass 3 and the first word is hot
[10:59:44] <enjoycrf> its not wrapping the other words
[10:59:52] <enjoycrf> cause they all longer than 3 letters
[11:00:11] <enjoycrf> how do i find the length of the longest word?
[11:00:34] <enjoycrf> im thinking i should do that in the word wrap func
[11:00:52] <enjoycrf> should i jus get the qjuery wrap plugin?
[11:01:09] <enjoycrf> this is the bogus
[11:01:10] <enjoycrf> !
[11:01:35] <DyeA> kborcher: it sounds like it does what i want: Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue
[11:01:45] <michael-i> Hi all. I'm wondering if it is possible to have my ajax error handler also receive the returned data. My REST api communicates conflicting objects with a 409 and lists the specific fields in the returned data.
[11:01:48] <enjoycrf> text.split(' ')
[11:02:00] <enjoycrf> foreach indexof
[11:02:10] <kborchers> DyeA: the key there is "in the queue" but you wanted no queue so they would run simultaneously
[11:02:12] <DyeA> kborcher: o i see what you are saying you can't overlayp
[11:02:16] <enjoycrf> grrrrrr
[11:02:24] <enjoycrf> baloney
[11:03:01] <DyeA> yeah i recall this issue from before, i had to write a function to overlap animations
[11:04:02] <enjoycrf> this is why programmers suicide
[11:04:39] <kborchers> michael-i: yes, the error callback has the jqXHR so your data should be available. you may want to look at the statusCode function to only perform something if the error is 409 see ?ajax
[11:04:39] <bot-t> michael-i, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:05:34] <kborchers> DyeA: if you just use queue: false and a setTimeout, you will get your delayed overlap
[11:06:24] <michael-i> kborchers: ah, I see….looks like I need to use >=1.5 so I have access to that. Thanks for the pointer!
[11:08:12] <burzum> can anyone recommend a jquery plugin that allows me to style a select box nice as the designer intended? i found dozends but i dont want to try them all before i pick one...
[11:08:23] <enjoycrf> who wants to do a group suicide w me
[11:09:21] <iLogic> you guys know a jquery plugin that makes a div rotate like mac os x's quartz composer cube? I can't seem to find it anywhere :(
[11:09:22] <donburks> enjoycrf: Sorry, I just checked my calendar. I'm not due to die until 2051. And I may have to postpone that.
[11:09:56] <donburks> iLogic: Good luck.
[11:10:10] <DyeA> kborcher: I ended up writing this simplify my calls
[11:10:12] <DyeA> http://fiddle.jshell.net/DyeA/GNcC5/
[11:10:55] <donburks> burzum: As each plugin has slightly different characteristics, your best bet is to try and match what it does with what you want it to do. Trial and error is inevitable.
[11:11:44] <burzum> donburks arw ... ok i care mostly about that it shows - when js is on - the same in all browsers and that i can style the "button" part, the arrow on the right side of a select
[11:12:05] <enjoycrf> my code is beautiful; like me
[11:12:19] <surfdue> I am looping through a form and using the input name if tehre is an error however the input name is name_random_number how can i only show the word before the _123123123
[11:12:31] <surfdue> the numbers are always random so I cant use a str replace
[11:13:02] <ryrych> hello
[11:13:02] <woopwoop> var a = -1; $.each(peoples.stats, function() { a++; $('#gallery').append('<li><a href="javascript:;" id="' + a + '"> is there any easier way? would it be more efficient to use index?
[11:13:13] <enjoycrf> dam ur code is ugly
[11:13:23] <enjoycrf> dont ever paste it
[11:13:43] <surfdue> lulz
[11:13:53] <woopwoop> lol
[11:13:55] <ryrych> this makes a button in jquery ui theme 1.8.5 but won't in 1.8.16 – what changed?
[11:14:00] <ryrych> http://pastie.org/2423632
[11:14:19] <surfdue> actually, how can I use jquery to determine the count of the table row?
[11:14:31] <donburks> surfdue: Two options. Use .split('_') on the input name, or set a class.
[11:14:35] <enjoycrf> omfg ppl cant make their own btns anymore
[11:14:38] <kborchers> surfdue: str = str.substr(0, str.indexOf("_"));
[11:14:40] <surfdue> donburks: got that finished already ;)
[11:14:44] <donburks> surfdue: $("tr").length
[11:14:53] <enjoycrf> jquery has ruined ppl
[11:14:57] <surfdue> donburks: but i need to determine from INSIDE the current TR
[11:15:01] <surfdue> donburks: in an each loop
[11:15:21] <enjoycrf> dood
[11:15:28] <kborchers> surfdue: $(this).closest("table").find("tr").length;
[11:15:29] <enjoycrf> tr.html.length
[11:15:32] <donburks> surfdue: $(this).index()
[11:15:43] <surfdue> kthx
[11:16:01] <donburks> But make sure $(this) refers to the <tr>, not a <td> or <thead> or something like that.
[11:16:02] <surfdue> now how do i figure out why my android phone is making a new text sound when there is none?
[11:16:26] <donburks> Android uses the same notification sound for text messages and other notifications, like battery and data.
[11:16:35] <surfdue> donburks: your cute.. :P
[11:16:54] <donburks> You forgot helpful, humourous, and incredibly sexy.
[11:17:00] <surfdue> oh those too +1
[11:20:18] <jwei> Hello,
[11:20:18] <jwei> New to jQuery/javascript here and looking for a little help. I am writing a site with a simple navigation menu. It works like this. A user clicks a link in the menu, the link is set to an 'active' colour and the appropriate section is set from hidden to visible ( all of the sections are set to hidden when the document loads ). When the user clicks another link that link is set to the active color, the others are set to the default colour, any
[11:20:18] <jwei> visible sections are set to hidden and the relevant section is set to visible. This works just fine, but I used individual element #ids and its very ugly with a lot of repetition. I am in the process of rewriting the code to use .classes and be a little bit more flexible with less repeated code.
[11:20:19] <jwei> The Question I have is this: How do I tell it what section to show?
[11:20:19] <jwei> User clicks on a.linkfornavigation, colour is set, section.blah are set to hidden, section#thisiswhatyouwant is set to visible. But how do I tell a.linkfornavigation where it should point? each section has a unique #id ( I guess so could the link they click ) but how do I get the #id of the relevant linked section from the clicked link?
[11:20:19] <jwei> I can share my code and any help at all would be very much appreciated.
[11:20:30] <surfdue> what?
[11:20:48] <surfdue> jwei: can you paste bin that
[11:22:32] <surfdue> jwei: please dont pm me.. i just died
[11:23:15] <jwei> sorry. yes I can paste just didn't want to spam the room. hold up one sec.
[11:23:31] <kborchers> jwei: you already did that
[11:27:43] <jwei> surfdude: $(document).ready(function(){
[11:27:43] <jwei> /  Hides .thing class as soon as the DOM is ready.
[11:27:43] <jwei> /  $('section.thing').hide(0);
[11:27:44] <jwei> /  Highlight selected link & set all others to default.
[11:27:44] <jwei>   $('#links a').click(function(){
[11:27:45] <jwei>     $(this).addClass('selected');
[11:27:45] <jwei>     $(this).siblings().removeClass('selected');
[11:27:45] <jwei>   });
[11:27:46] <jwei>   
[11:27:46] <jwei> /  Shows one section and hides all others on clicking the noted link.
[11:27:47] <jwei>   $('a.thinger').click(function() {
[11:27:47] <jwei>     $('section.thing').hide(0);
[11:27:47] <jwei> /  $('section#information').fadeOut('fast');
[11:27:48] <jwei>     $('#thingone').fadeIn('slow');
[11:27:48] <jwei>     return false;
[11:27:48] <jwei>   });
[11:27:56] <snover> jwei: DO NOT paste code in the channel.
[11:27:59] <kborchers> jwei: are you kidding me?!
[11:28:07] <Zerxer> ajpiano about to lay the smack down
[11:28:13] <Zerxer> good, I inbefore'd
[11:28:19] * Zerxer resumes to idle status
[11:28:20] <ajpiano> sorry i didn't know when that was going to end
[11:28:40] <snover> ajpiano: about 20 seconds before you kicked :P
[11:28:43] <zoned> i have a page setup like this <div class=myClass> bunch of stuff </div> <div class=myClass> bunch of stuff </div> .... from inside any of the myClass divs, i want to be able to select the "next" and "previous" divs with class=myClass .... i believe this should be possible by using .next and .prev selectors, but i can't really seem to figure it out
[11:29:44] <enjoycrf> anyone ever mess with the drawing api
[11:30:24] <jwei> Whatever guys, I thought this was suppose to be a place for help. I don't have time for bastards on the internet. peace.
[11:30:31] <zoned> lol..
[11:30:34] <Elephant> ?
[11:30:41] <Elephant> WHATEVER GUYS
[11:30:50] <Zerxer> lol
[11:30:50] <snover> yeah you bastards. stop enforcing netiquette.
[11:31:02] * kborchers gives jwei a hug as he leaves
[11:31:14] <Zerxer> darn was hoping he was still on the server
[11:31:14] <ajpiano> shheesh
[11:31:20] <Zerxer> but he left freenode completely
[11:31:21] <donburks> Awwww, muffin.
[11:31:25] <ajpiano> there's a difference between getting kciekd because you're mid flood and being kicked cause you're being a jerk
[11:31:31] <Elephant> lol "18:23:15             jwei | sorry. yes I can paste just didn't want to spam the room. hold up one sec."
[11:31:31] <ajpiano> it's not like he was "in trouble"
[11:31:38] <ajpiano> (for future reference)
[11:31:54] <snover> whatever ajpiano, I saw the resentment in your eyes
[11:32:02] <Elephant> you did it just to be mean
[11:32:06] <Elephant> it's obvious
[11:32:20] <zoned> if he wanted to know what he did wrong, he would have asked (if he didn't already figure it out). he's a quitter.
[11:32:33] <kborchers> zoned: from anywhere inside the myClass div you can do $(this).closest(".myClass").next();
[11:32:38] <Elephant> I heard that quitters never win.
[11:33:33] <zoned> kborchers: closest was what i was missing. works.thanks :)
[11:33:40] <kborchers> np
[11:38:07] <CannedCorn> hey guys I'm calling the following function on document.ready for an already drawn progress bar but it isn't updating… any ideas on why that would be the case?
[11:38:08] <CannedCorn> http://pastie.org/2423744
[11:41:18] <kborchers> CannedCorn: we probably need a little more information than that. preferrably see ?demo
[11:41:19] <bot-t> CannedCorn, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:41:20] <zoned> kborchers: closest(".myClass").next().length returns 1, even if there are no myClass divs that exist afterwards
[11:44:37] <kborchers> zoned: next doesn't care if the next sibling is .myClass unless you tell it that's what you want. it just gets the next sibling. try .closest(".myClass").next(".myClass").length
[11:44:43] <CannedCorn> http://pastie.org/2423764
[11:45:14] <CannedCorn> and this is what that function looks like
[11:45:15] <CannedCorn> http://pastie.org/2423777
[11:45:31] <CannedCorn> i can see test printing out but the progress bar stays at 0
[11:45:47] <kborchers> CannedCorn: but where is that function defined?
[11:45:49] <CannedCorn> unload i have custom js run $("#minutes_used_bar").progressbar({value: 0});
[11:45:55] <CannedCorn> its defined in custom.js
[11:46:05] <CannedCorn> unload = onload
[11:46:26] <CannedCorn> kborchers does that make sense
[11:46:30] <CannedCorn> ?
[11:47:52] <kborchers> CannedCorn: have you tried logging $("#minutes_used_bar") to make sure it is selecting the element?
[11:48:11] <CannedCorn> yeah well it draws with 0 to start
[11:48:15] <CannedCorn> so that is working
[11:48:18] <CannedCorn> right?
[11:49:05] <CannedCorn> yeah in chrome it first logs [] then i see it populate with the element… race condition?
[11:49:06] <kborchers> it may be working where you initialize the progressbar but maybe not in that function
[11:49:10] <gakins> I'm trying to use live() or delegate() to call a function on an object that doesn't exist yet
[11:49:41] <gakins> $(#objThatDoesntExist).dynatree( event, function)
[11:49:42] <RobertV> function Widget(){   $('#foo').hover(function(){  /* how can i access Widget's "this" object from here? should i pass it as a parameter to the anonymous function */    });    }
[11:49:45] <kborchers> CannedCorn: sounds like that may be what's going on.
[11:49:52] <CannedCorn> ok hrm
[11:49:54] <gakins> If I do it like that, it says function doens't exist
[11:50:09] <CannedCorn> i thought that calling docoument.ready would make sure the other js files that it depends on have loaded?
[11:50:21] <kborchers> nope, just that the dom is ready
[11:50:52] <gakins> Not sure of the dynatree syntax  (maybe $("#tree").delegate('#tree', 'something', handler);
[11:50:53] <gakins> ?
[11:50:58] <kborchers> then i believe that document.ready's are fired in order so the one in your page would fire before any in custom.js
[11:51:07] <CannedCorn> hrm
[11:51:51] <kborchers> why not just move those scripts up to your head?
[11:52:19] <CannedCorn> got it!
[11:52:23] <CannedCorn> you were exactly right!
[11:52:25] <CannedCorn> thanks kborchers
[11:52:29] <kborchers> np
[11:54:29] <enjoycrf> anyone ever work w fedex api
[11:54:36] <enjoycrf> fuk fedex!
[11:54:48] <enjoycrf> worthless
[11:56:13] <RobertV> any ideas how to access the defining context's this object inside an anon function?     .hover(function() { /* need the parent context's 'this' here */ });
[11:56:46] <tbranyen> RobertV: use proxy

[12:05:19] <ries> Hello, I kinda have the feeling that with this function $('#ajaxContainer').load(toLoad,'',showNewContent());  showNewContent is called before all content was actually fetched.
[12:06:05] <ngharo> you're doing it wrong
[12:06:20] <ngharo> $('#ajaxContainer').load(toLoad, showNewContent);
[12:06:45] <ngharo> you want to pass the function.  What you're doing is executing the function() and passing it's return value
[12:07:54] <ries> ngharo: Ahhhh…. shuuuuuut
[12:08:40] <surfdue> kborchers: if im inside a tr will closest tr find the current one?
[12:08:42] <ries> ngharo: totally overlooked that....
[12:09:03] <kborchers> surfdue: no
[12:09:10] <surfdue> kborchers: how do i find the current one?
[12:09:21] <kborchers> $(this)
[12:09:40] <kborchers> maybe need a little more context
[12:10:31] <surfdue> kborchers: No im inside a tr, td, span
[12:10:38] <surfdue> so i need to find the tr that im in
[12:10:46] <surfdue> kborchers: to get the index
[12:10:56] <kborchers> surfdue: then yes, .closest("tr")
[12:11:15] <surfdue> kborchers: closest tr is returning 1 when it should be returning 2.. :/
[12:11:27] <kborchers> closest only returns one element
[12:11:31] <larzen-wrk> Folks.. i want to clone the first child of a class... but w/o any of the data elements or jQuery objects... just straight HTML
[12:11:33] <impi> hello,
[12:11:43] <sphinxxx> whats a really lightweight content slider plugin?
[12:11:43] <surfdue> kborchers: no.. index
[12:11:46] <larzen-wrk> can anyone show me how that's done?
[12:11:48] <surfdue> is returning the inproper index
[12:11:56] <impi> is there a way i can echo a jquery var and store it in my page and then have my otehr functions pick up on this?
[12:12:00] <sphinxxx> i found some really small ones, but they didn't have to ability to call "next slide" and "prev slide" methods
[12:12:15] <impi> like var ishomepage = true/false;
[12:12:36] <kborchers> surfdue: it's finding the closest tr up the dom from where you are. if the id is wrong, you're not where you think you are
[12:12:44] <sphinxxx> larzen-wrk ; .html()
[12:13:29] <surfdue> kborchers: what im trying to do is when i change a select in a row, im trying to move that row to the top or bottom
[12:14:20] <kborchers> surfdue: might help if you paste some code
[12:16:11] <niKnight> Does, var abc = abc || {}; Mean, new variable 'abc' is equal to an already existing abc or an empty object?
[12:16:43] <sphinxxx> anyone?
[12:17:23] <garann> niKnight: it means if abc doesn't exist, create an new object
[12:17:47] <surfdue> kborchers: http://pastebin.com/nwZTiDUr
[12:18:26] <surfdue> kborchers: current_index is coming to 1 when its the second row BELOW the thead/tr
[12:18:36] <mrchess`> niKnight: abc = abc || {} , abc = abc if abc already exists, otherwise abc = {}
[12:18:38] <surfdue> technically 1 would be correct, if there was no thead/tr
[12:19:13] <niKnight> okay, thank you. garann and mrchess`
[12:19:58] <niKnight> (function ($) { ... code ... } ) (abc.$); How would this be described?
[12:21:01] <niKnight> or what link or search phrase would better explain that to me?
[12:21:39] <kborchers> surfdue: ok, let's think through this. so you are just moving the current row to the top or bottom depending on what they select? is it a select with just those two options?
[12:22:11] <surfdue> kborchers: no it has 3. Closed, Not contacted, and ''
[12:23:02] <auro1> Hey
[12:23:02] <djQuery> niKnight: you mean defining an anonymous function and executing it immediately?
[12:23:11] <auro1> Is there a way to go to the bottom of an overflowed div?
[12:23:23] <djQuery> niKnight: self executing anonomous function
[12:24:21] <djQuery> niKnight: what to explain about it you are defining a funciton that accepts a parameter called $ and executing it immediately
[12:24:39] <niKnight> probably :) I'm working on the mediaelements html5 flash fallback jquery scripts. and I'm trying to understand all the syntax. For the most part I get it. And you've very much given me what I needed to hear.
[12:26:35] <juha_> lol i just bought my first mac

[12:28:07] <kborchers> surfdue: you ready for this?
[12:28:30] <snover> yes, it is a shame you will now have the best power connector, monitor, and trackpad on the market
[12:28:58] <kborchers> surfdue: can't believe i forgot that index() is 0 based ... 1 is the second elem

[12:32:46] <Z3R0> Can someone explain to me, why I can't use my jquery from the index on id's from a loaded page from .load() ?
[12:33:14] <jeffsmykil> how do I return the XML from an ajax call?
[12:33:23] <jeffsmykil> return xml; doesnt work
[12:33:33] <gnarf> Z3R0: you need to either a) use live events / delegation b) search for the content after it has been added to the page
[12:33:56] <surfdue> kborchers: when i move the element the table indexs are off
[12:34:04] <Z3R0> well I added the jquery to the page that was being loaded and it works just fine, was just curious...
[12:34:04] <surfdue> how can i update the table indexes to be proper
[12:34:09] <Cork[home]> jeffsmykil: you mean from a function you do the call in?
[12:34:18] <jeffsmykil> yes
[12:34:24] <kborchers> surfdue: what do you mean?
[12:34:28] <jeffsmykil> so i have xml = getXML();
[12:34:36] <Z3R0> guess I will look at what 'live events' are
[12:34:39] <jeffsmykil> and in getXML() i have return XML;
[12:34:51] <gnarf> Z3R0: look at using the .load callback
[12:35:06] <gnarf> Z3R0: put your script you need to execute in the callback
[12:35:11] <surfdue> kborchers: so index 3 moved to 0 now when i loop through the tr the table is 0 3 1 2
[12:35:15] <surfdue> instead of 0 1 2 3
[12:35:17] <Cork[home]> jeffsmykil: you can't really do that, ajax is async, your function will have closed before its done
[12:35:23] <Z3R0> oh wow, did not even think about that
[12:35:35] <jeffsmykil> Cork[home]: not a huge problem
[12:35:37] <jeffsmykil> thanks!
[12:35:40] <Z3R0> well it's not really a script...
[12:35:43] <Cork[home]> np
[12:35:44] <gnarf> Z3R0: that was the option b :)
[12:35:44] <Z3R0> it's a .click() trigger
[12:35:53] <gnarf> Z3R0: that is a script
[12:36:02] <kborchers> surfdue: what does that loop do?
[12:36:06] <Z3R0> o.o
[12:36:16] <djQuery> jeffsmykil: $.ajax  is typicaly smart enough to know what u are returning. or if you have access to the web service you can add [ScriptMethod(UseHttpGet = false, ResponseFormat = ResponseFormat.Json)]  to it if you are talking .net
[12:36:25] <djQuery> and it will return json instead
[12:36:33] <surfdue> kborchers: well the same code i pasted im trying to do the second change, and it does not work properly because the first change messed up the index
[12:36:46] <Z3R0> hmmmm... butI do other loads to this page later on as well, don't want to have to add that to each one
[12:36:58] <Z3R0> ya that still didn't work
[12:36:59] <kborchers> right, but what index are you trying to find in that loop?
[12:37:18] <surfdue> kborchers: well dosnt matter im looping freshly and it thinks its still 3.
[12:37:40] <surfdue> kborchers: i need to re-index
[12:37:48] <juha_> first thing i did, downloaded google chrome and set it up as default browser <3
[12:38:38] <Z3R0> thanks gnarf, the live was what I was looking for
[12:38:45] <james13433> How can I replace a number found after "p=" in a string?
[12:39:08] <kborchers> surfdue: you are still in the context of the change handler so the indexes haven't been updated. i'm trying to ask you what that loop is trying to find so that you can do it a different way because that will not work
[12:40:02] <kayT3> anyone know if its is faster to get an element by name or by ID or is it generally the same operation costing?
[12:40:03] <gnarf> ?newContent @Z3R0
[12:40:04] <bot-t> Z3R0, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[12:40:19] <sandstrom> What events are iPhones emitting when I put my finger on a div and remove it (a swift touch that is). 'click' don't seem to work. Neither does tap or touch. Ideas?
[12:40:45] <surfdue> kborchers: if i know the index how can i prepend to it?
[12:40:48] <thinkt4nk> kayT3, it's much faster to get by ID
[12:41:01] <thinkt4nk> it simply calls the native getElementById()
[12:41:54] <kayT3> thanks thinkt4nk
[12:41:57] <thinkt4nk> np
[12:42:20] <kayT3> got another question... say I don't have IDs and I want to inject ID tags on some elements that only have names... say like 20 items
[12:42:25] <kborchers> surfdue: i'm still not sure what you are doing but i think you are looking for see ?insertBefore
[12:42:25] <bot-t> surfdue, .insertBefore(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements before the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[12:43:01] <thinkt4nk> kayT3 > see this great blog post about jQuery performance http://www.artzstudio.com/2009/04/jquery-performance-rules/
[12:43:13] <kayT3> is it more costly to do an attr('id' ... and then get by ID or would have getting it by name have been faster
[12:44:08] <thinkt4nk> depends, I think, on how you access the elements before setting attr('id'
[12:44:26] <thinkt4nk> why don't you just benchmark it with jsperf?
[12:45:27] <kayT3> var selector = "input[name=\"" + elementName +  "\"]";
[12:45:27] <kayT3>  var addID = $(selector).attr("id", elementName);
[12:45:39] <kayT3> that is pretty much it
[12:46:04] <surfdue> kborchers: any use of http://www.datatables.net/ ?
[12:46:16] <surfdue> kborchers: im goign to use it i believe, just need to find a way to sort by a select box
[12:46:36] <moxie_> can anyone tell me how to get the response of the ajax call to be the return value of this function https://gist.github.com/1168946
[12:46:42] <Merrick> I'm using jQuery slideViewer 1.2 and for some reason, the numbered navigatino links are not working.  any ideas?
[12:47:12] <thinkt4nk> wait, lol, you want to know if getting by name is slower than getting by name _then_ setting id _then_ getting by id?
[12:49:04] <SinnerNyx> i am trying to use a jquery plugin but i can't find a list of events that objects fire in the documentation. is there some way to listen to all fired events and list them?
[12:49:05] <kborchers> surfdue: yes, i have used it. what's wrong with just sorting by the column headers?
[12:49:11] <Sean-Der> http://jsfiddle.net/LF7RS/ Can someone help, why am I always getting the .val Y?
[12:49:25] <surfdue> kborchers: how can i reinitiate the sort?
[12:49:30] <surfdue> after a change?
[12:50:27] <kayT3> well it depends. I am supporting a really messy codebase that has no ID tags and liberal use of names
[12:50:34] <FelicianoX> Sean-Der that's strange :o
[12:51:15] <niKnight> djQuery, or anyone else. For the self executing anonymous function, '(function ($) {}) ();' what is the scope of the parameter '$', where and why does it exist? I'm reverse engineering someone elses code as a learning base. I understand $ === jQuery. So does that mean jQuery aka '$' is a live object with methods and properties? And is that something thats initialized by jquery.js when included?
[12:51:18] <thinkt4nk> moxie_ you're doin it wrong
[12:51:25] <Sean-Der> FelicianoX: Am I making a stupid mistake
[12:51:26] <moxie_> thinkt4nk: why
[12:51:27] <danzik171> Sean-Der: You seem to be missing an equal sign in your if statement.
[12:51:30] <thinkt4nk> moxie_ have the function accept a callback
[12:51:32] <kborchers> surfdue: have you read this? http://www.datatables.net/api it has functions to update (fnUpdate) the table contents (which keeps track of sorting, etc.) and you can sort (fnSort) using external elements
[12:51:38] <Sean-Der> Oh its doing assignment
[12:51:43] <thinkt4nk> moxie_ it's async, so you have to adopt an async pattern
[12:51:45] <Sean-Der> Well that was stupid of me
[12:51:47] <FelicianoX> Oh i didnt see that :p
[12:52:06] <moxie_> thinkt4nk: thats what I figured
[12:52:14] <moxie_> thinkt4nk: siiiiggghhhsss
[12:52:29] <thinkt4nk> moxie_ otherwise you return before the get even responds.
[12:52:39] <thinkt4nk> moxie_ lol, it's no biggie
[12:53:33] <surfdue> kborchers: i dont understand it.. i just changed the select which is a td select, i want to just re-sort using the sorting already used
[12:53:47] <surfdue> kborchers: aka bring that row i just changed up to the top since im sorting by select box desc
[12:53:58] <djQuery> niKnight: it has the same scope as any other paratementer. just inside the function
[12:55:42] <enjoycrf> how the hell would you do wordwrap based on box width?
[12:55:44] <enjoycrf> ???????
[12:55:58] <enjoycrf> since word wrap takes the character count
[12:55:58] <surfdue> kborchers: i believe the fn sort function is more what im looking for, HOWEVER its not working :( a.aoColumns[t] is undefined
[12:57:02] <larzen-wrk> win
[12:58:42] <SinnerNyx> i am trying to use the jquery 'jstree' plugin but i can't find a list of events that objects fire in the documentation. is there some way to listen to all fired events and list them?
[12:59:19] <surfdue> kborchers: i fixed that..
[12:59:50] <kborchers> surfdue: ok, so everything working now?
[12:59:52] <TonyWanis> Hello
[13:01:06] <surfdue> kborchers: semi.. im sorting two columns but its not doing it properly well it probably is but i want it differently, the first column i want to group all of those and be at the top then sort those by the second, third, fourth and so on
[13:03:05] <kborchers> surfdue: so if you do something like this .fnSort( [ [0,'asc'], [1,'asc']..... ] ); for all of you columns it should do that
[13:03:15] <niKnight> djQuery: Okay, all of this is making sence except the last part. the ... } (); or ... } (jQuery); or ... } (abc.$); I'm reading that the (); at the end, is what executes it. So why define an object. Would it be executed by the defined object?
[13:03:54] <surfdue> kborchers: i put it backwards sorry
[13:05:05] <kayT3> does jquery have the facility to assign elements to varaibles like getelementbyID can or can it only allow me to do lookup and assign dom values using things like .val() ?
[13:05:57] <thinkt4nk> kayT3 you can assign jQuery wrapped elements using the selectors
[13:06:00] <djQuery> well (funciton($){})() executes the function passing no parameters to it (funciton($){})(jQuery) defines, passes the global jQuery varaiable to the function and exectures it
[13:06:52] <kayT3> i know that thinkt4nk, I don't want to do that. I want to actually assign the element to a variable so I can access it via .value not .val()
[13:07:13] <kborchers> kayT3: yes, you can do something like var elem = $("#myElem")[0]
[13:07:29] <kborchers> but why not just use .val() ?
[13:07:49] <thinkt4nk> kayT3 or iterate over the entire set with $('#myElem').each(function() { // assign this })
[13:08:19] <danzik171> thinkt4nk: You should only have one element in an ID selector - iterating doesn't make sense
[13:08:25] <kborchers> kayT3: you could do var elem = $("#myElem"); and then later do elem.val();
[13:08:33] <thinkt4nk> kayT3 kborchers' method is dangerous, also
[13:08:35] <niKnight> djQuery: You have been so helpful. Hopefully the last question here. (function(window,document,undefined){ ... })(this,document); Considering what we have gone over here, how would you describe the relation between window,document,undefined and this,document.
[13:08:50] <thinkt4nk> danzik171 you can't even be sure that there's one element
[13:08:51] <thinkt4nk> derp
[13:09:02] <thinkt4nk> so, yeah, my way is better
[13:09:03] <kborchers> thinkt4nk: why is that?
[13:09:09] <thinkt4nk> wow, seriously dude?
[13:09:39] <thinkt4nk> you've never written a selector that hasn't returned a single element?
[13:09:53] <kborchers> i selected by id. there better be only one
[13:10:03] <kborchers> if not you have bigger issues
[13:10:03] <thinkt4nk> there might not even BE one!
[13:10:08] <danzik171> thinkt4nk: Sure.  But if you're doing iteration because you need to be sure that it exists?  You're doing it wrong.
[13:10:38] <meosweetmeo> i set up window.hashchange listener and call for location.hash onload. why it is being called twice?
[13:10:48] <djQuery> niKnight: feel like this is an interview or something.   your just defining a function that takes 3 parameters and only passing it 2, dont realy like the way that you are using document as I believe it is a reserved word. I know a lotta syntax checkers will barf at you naming the 3rd paramenter undefined but it works fine.
[13:10:50] <kborchers> i guess when i select by id, i know it's there ...
[13:11:12] <SinnerNyx> i am trying to use a jquery plugin but i can't find a list of events that objects fire in the documentation. is there some way to listen to all fired events and list them?
[13:11:46] <thinkt4nk> danzik171 > you should never just access [0] without checking the length first, and he was asking a question that just happened to use an id as an example
[13:12:53] <thinkt4nk> SinnerNyx > this might help: http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[13:13:39] <JPN> I'm looking to duplicate the lightbox opening effect in some custom code. Is there a jquery ui feature that scales a box from the center of the page to _x_ size?
[13:14:38] <niKnight> Perfect thanks. I appriciate your time. What kind of cookies do you like?
[13:14:52] <niKnight> djQuery: ^^ :P
[13:14:54] <SinnerNyx> thinkt4nk, i tried using that. i'm not sure i'm following how that's used :S..
[13:15:09] <thinkt4nk> oh, it's a bookmarklet
[13:15:27] <thinkt4nk> add it to your bookmarks, and execute it
[13:15:57] <thinkt4nk> it'll show all of the events, and as you hover over the icons, it'll show you handler source
[13:15:57] <SinnerNyx> thinkt4nk, ya i got that, but once it's loaded i just see a bunch of icons appear, and i can't trigger any events
[13:16:07] <thinkt4nk> hover over the icons
[13:16:17] <SinnerNyx> thinkt4nk, lemme try that now
[13:16:28] <jwmann> I'm making a form submit and I'm trying to grab the value of my option. Right now I can grab the option via $form_state['values']['myform'] but how would I grab the options value?
[13:17:40] <surfdue> kborchers: how can i make the table header always remain visible even when the table is very long / scrolling
[13:19:10] <kborchers> surfdue: http://www.datatables.net/extras/fixedheader/
[13:19:14] <thinkt4nk> jwmann > value is an attribute of the select, not of an option
[13:19:15] <SinnerNyx> thinkt4nk, now it's stuck on "Loading Visual Event". the Javascript console shows a SyntaxError.... :(
[13:19:23] <surfdue> kborchers: i cant seem to make it appear, perhaps my page is to small
[13:19:32] <thinkt4nk> SinnerNyx which browser are you using?
[13:20:10] <nullwire> I don't fully understand the live function, and I am trying to make it so a DOM object added after page load can be removed within a function. By understanding how http://pastie.org/2424235 can work I will be able to determine what to do with my script.
[13:20:21] <SinnerNyx> chrome
[13:20:25] <SinnerNyx> thinkt4nk, ^^
[13:21:10] <thinkt4nk> SinnerNyx is it a syntax error in the bookmarklet or in the code in your document?  I would guess it's the latter
[13:21:41] <SinnerNyx> well it doesn't appear in the console, until after i run the bookmarklet so my guess is tending towards the former
[13:21:57] <djQuery> niKnight: I hate cookies, have them turned off in all my browsers
[13:23:30] <surfdue> oh kborchers i have a problem, since my header is fixed 60 px tall at the top, i believe the table header is under that
[13:23:34] <thinkt4nk> hrmmm... well I dunno' what to tell you.  It's tough to say without seeing your code and the syntax error
[13:23:34] <niKnight> lol.
[13:23:38] <surfdue> kborchers: how can i make it so it always floats below?
[13:24:10] <SinnerNyx> it says Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (    VisualEvent.oGetEvents.fnDom0, thinkt4nk
[13:24:14] <nullwire> Surely there is a way to use .live() in http://pastie.org/2424235 ... I just don't understand how to do it in this format .live( eventType, handler )
[13:24:15] <SinnerNyx> does that help?
[13:24:33] <djQuery> niKnight: http://jqfundamentals.com/#example-2.37
[13:25:24] <thinkt4nk> not really, sorry
[13:25:37] <SinnerNyx> alright, thx anyways thinkt4nk
[13:25:49] <thinkt4nk> np, hope you get it figured out
[13:26:01] <thinkt4nk> you can always check the data() of the objects in question, though
[13:26:51] <kborchers> surfdue: there is the zTop option which you can use to have it positioned over your site header but i don't see any options to have it stop before it reaches the top of the window
[13:26:57] <surfdue> kborchers: perhaps im not loading it
[13:26:58] <thinkt4nk> SinnerNyx > console.log($(your_selector).data('events'));
[13:28:45] <nullwire> can anyone help me understand how to make this work? http://pastie.org/2424235
[13:29:04] <potatodemon> So I want to .load() some contents into a DIV, but I don't want to inherate any CSS styles from the page in that div.   How can I get around that.  I think an iFrame might help, but I can't get that damned thing to resize dynamically. Thanks
[13:29:27] <kborchers> nullwire: that script you pasted adds, then immediately removes your div every 60 seconds. not sure that's what you want
[13:29:48] <fris> can someone tell me the major differences between the two pieces of code? they look like they do the same http://pastie.org/2424278
[13:29:56] <nullwire> I know that, I'm trying to understand how to make live() work inside a function.
[13:30:31] <jwmann> thinkt4nk: I posted this in the wrong IRC channel. LOLOLOL xD
[13:31:01] <nullwire> It actually doesn't remove it kborchers, it just adds it, then cant find it because the DOM object is not live.
[13:31:02] <thinkt4nk> jwmann > heh, I thought that looked suspiciously like php
[13:31:17] <nullwire> I just need to figure out how to make the added DOM object live in http://pastie.org/2424235
[13:31:40] <SinnerNyx> thinkt4nk, maybe i'll do that. i just did a regex search through the source code for "[A-Za-z]+\.jstree" and I think I have all of them now
[13:32:14] <thinkt4nk> nullwire > actually, yes it does remove it every time
[13:32:19] <kborchers> nullwire: if the dom is ready, it will remove it.
[13:32:36] <kborchers> if it wasn't ready, it was never added
[13:33:39] <surfdue> kborchers: well its working now however it just scrolls right past the top of the page never jumps back down
[13:33:52] <potatodemon> How can I remove all the CSS styles for a DIV ?
[13:34:18] <kborchers> surfdue: not sure on that one :/
[13:34:21] <thinkt4nk> potatodemon > this should do it $('#yourDiv').attr('style','');
[13:34:36] <sphinxxx> is the click event buggy on <a> tags?
[13:34:52] <nullwire> thinkt4nk, you're right. in my actual script im using jQuery('.item').last().remove() and it is not working however
[13:35:05] <meosweetmeo> i set up window.hashchange listener and call for location.hash onload. why it is being called twice?
[13:35:05] <thinkt4nk> sphinxxx no
[13:35:14] <nullwire> maybe I need a break
[13:36:14] <potatodemon> thanks thinkt4nk I will give that a try
[13:36:22] <sphinxxx> i've double checked the name of the id a hundred times, can't figure out why it won't fire
[13:36:22] <thinkt4nk> np
[13:36:47] <thinkt4nk> sphinxxx after an ajax call?
[13:36:50] <surfdue> kborchers: ya i see it and it scrolls up and down but when i scroll to high it goes right of the page
[13:37:09] <sphinxxx> no ajax
[13:37:48] <kborchers> surfdue: right but if you are using the plugin correctly, it shouldn't.
[13:37:57] <thinkt4nk> sphinxxx anything in console?
[13:38:00] <thinkt4nk> errors?
[13:38:39] <surfdue> kborchers: i am, and it isnt. however since i cant float it with css (formatting / widths mess up) can i just make it repeat every 4 records or something
[13:38:56] <rhizmoe> jquery-mobile, you continually reward me with learning opportunities
[13:39:19] <potatodemon> thinkt4nk: that didn't work for me :( All the inherated styles are left
[13:39:30] <thinkt4nk> from the css
[13:39:31] <thinkt4nk> ?
[13:39:55] <thinkt4nk> oh, I'm sorry.  I assumed you meant to clear every style that you set with css()
[13:40:13] <thinkt4nk> yeah, it won't blow out all of the stylesheet definitions
[13:40:42] <thinkt4nk> I don't know off the top of my head, how you would go about doing that
[13:40:45] <kborchers> surfdue: not sure if you can do that. would be pretty annoying for the user too i would imagine. so you really can't just use the zTop option of the plugin to change the header's z-index? that messes up your layout?
[13:42:05] <sphinxxx> thinkt4nk: no errors, its very strange
[13:43:52] <sphinxxx> seems like i needed to use the .live event instead
[13:44:10] <thinkt4nk> why?
[13:44:17] <thinkt4nk> you said there was no ajax call
[13:44:37] <sphinxxx> idk
[13:44:39] <thinkt4nk> is the anchor added dynamically after document ready?
[13:44:44] <sphinxxx> maybe the slider plugin i have is doing something weird
[13:44:54] <sphinxxx> no its there on DOM ready
[13:45:24] <Brodingo> console.log($('#myID').length) <-- start here sphinxxx
[13:47:57] <sphinxxx> thx
[13:48:07] <thinkt4nk> was it 0?
[13:49:37] <Z3R0> Anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/28Agc/
[13:52:01] <thepacmanfan> will shadowbox and colorbox coexist?
[13:52:43] <Rushing> theoretically, yes. though it's possible they have conflicting css or something
[13:52:46] <jeffsmykil> anyone know if you can compare two open documents in Notepad++?
[13:52:48] <Rushing> only one way to find out ;)
[13:53:06] <thepacmanfan> well, i'm trying it, and just can't seem to get shadowbox to run...
[13:53:20] <thepacmanfan> the firebug console isn't showing any errors.
[13:53:25] <Rushing> jeffsmykil, right click on a tab and "move to another view" then plugins > compare
[13:53:51] <jeffsmykil> Rushing: yeah juuust found that as you were typing
[13:53:58] <Rushing> try taking colorbox out of the equation to see if there's a conflict, or if your code is just wrong
[13:55:09] <thepacmanfan> oh wait... i just remembered, i have never been able to get shadowbox running in drupal, even before i used colorbox
[13:55:47] <Z3R0> Anyone think they can help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/28Agc/1/
[13:57:23] <HS^> anyone ever used boxy /
[13:57:26] <HS^> ?
[13:57:29] <Brodingo> Z3R0 so are you going to have a bunch of #branch_id ?
[13:57:43] <Z3R0> ya I just modified that to use a .branch_id instead sorry about that
[13:57:48] <Rushing> Z3R0, branch_id should be a class or something
[13:57:49] <Z3R0> but either way, still not working
[13:57:51] <Rushing> or data- attribute
[13:58:07] <Brodingo> is your fiddle supposed to do something? cause youre using mootools
[13:58:16] <Z3R0> mootools?
[13:58:19] <thinkt4nk> lol
[13:58:35] <Rushing> change $(this).children(".branch_id") to $(this).find(...)
[13:58:46] <Brodingo> ^
[13:58:51] <Rushing> branch_id is not a direct descendant of branch_link
[13:58:59] <Brodingo> and possibly also e.preventDefault on your event
[13:59:12] <Z3R0> omg Rushing == <33's
[13:59:13] <Brodingo> to prevent jumping from the hash
[13:59:25] <Rushing> :p np
[13:59:34] <Z3R0> been dealing with that for a while now...
[13:59:41] <Z3R0> is there a better way to get the id ?
[13:59:57] <Z3R0> basically using that id in a query to load the form by id
[14:00:03] <Rushing> Z3R0, i'd probably just make the id a data attribute of the link
[14:00:09] <Z3R0> O.o
[14:00:40] <Rushing> <a href="#" class="branch_link" data-branch="{id}">
[14:00:44] <braddunbar> Should delegate work with a selector like '>button' (with a leading '>')?
[14:01:22] <Z3R0> O.o how do I reference that ?
[14:01:22] <Brodingo> Z3R0 then you can be sexy like $(this).data('branch')
[14:01:27] <Z3R0> omg
[14:01:32] <Rushing> also, instead of $(".branch_link").click(...), i'd do $(".branch_link").live("click", ...)
[14:01:43] <Z3R0> O.o
[14:02:05] <Rushing> that way there's only one event listener, and it doesn't have to attach to each .branch_link element
[14:02:07] <Z3R0> ya, I have the live('click') modified before that
[14:02:15] <braddunbar> It doesn't seem to in this fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/HzfCp/1/ - can anyone verify for me?
[14:02:32] <Rushing> braddunbar, no, it shouldn't
[14:02:43] <Z3R0> ok so add data -> <a> reference data ($this).data('name')
[14:02:55] <Z3R0> and be sure to use .live('click') instead of .click()
[14:03:04] <Rushing> yep
[14:04:02] <Brodingo> braddunbar i think that selector would be html>.b
[14:04:04] <Brodingo> not body>.b
[14:04:30] <dxtr> Oh hai. Let's say I'm making a drop-down menu with jquery and css. How in heavens sake do I make the menu drop down *OVER* the stuff underneath it?
[14:04:36] <dxtr> Right now it drops down below the divs under it
[14:04:44] <braddunbar> Rushing: Why not?
[14:04:52] <dxtr> z-index doesn't seem to cut it
[14:05:06] <duttons> could someone have a quick look at some code in a script and advise the best way to add a function to the existing script?
[14:05:17] <Rushing> braddunbar, actually i'm thinking of live, but the same rules may apply
[14:05:20] <braddunbar> Brodingo: Why html>.b?  It's a child of the body right?
[14:05:29] <dxtr> I give my menu z-index: 2; and my div z-index: 1;
[14:05:39] <Brodingo> yes, .b is a child of the body
[14:05:40] <Brodingo> not html
[14:05:45] <Rushing> basically only generic selectors work, cause it's applied against just the element, not from a context
[14:05:57] <Rushing> it may be limited to a context, but the selector is not "searched" for
[14:06:09] <braddunbar> Rushing: I couldn't find any documentation on caveats concerning '>', am I missing them?
[14:06:18] <Rushing> ^^
[14:06:19] <braddunbar> Ah!
[14:06:44] <braddunbar> So what is the definition of generic selectors?
[14:07:06] <braddunbar> anything not concerning the context?
[14:07:17] <Rushing> well i just made up the term, but i'd say something that can be equated to the current element only
[14:08:05] <Rushing> but you could check context in the event handler
[14:08:09] <b1lly> what am I doing wrong here? i'm using a post method to return data, but then i want the parent function to return the data of the post method http://pastie.org/2424470
[14:08:24] <braddunbar> Ok.  Thanks!
[14:08:42] <Brodingo> ?ajax101 @ b1lly
[14:08:42] <bot-t> b1lly, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[14:08:51] <thinkt4nk> b1lly > it's async, send a callback to the function to handle the return value
[14:09:14] <b1lly> the scope of the post success function doesn't pass it to it's parent
[14:10:11] <Brodingo> b1lly you need to change the way youre coding and start thinking asynchronously!
[14:10:14] <Rushing> what parent?
[14:10:25] <thinkt4nk> I think he's talking about the invoking method
[14:10:38] <thinkt4nk> just let him figure it out, his question's been answered
[14:10:55] <crankharder> is jquery mobile on-topic here?
[14:10:58] <Rushing> b1lly, your function should look more like getDriverRoute_CheckIn(driver_name, callback)
[14:11:09] <Rushing> where callback would be what you want to do once the ajax response is done
[14:11:15] <crankharder> er, guess so, it's in the topic ;)
[14:11:18] <Brodingo> Rushing++
[14:11:35] <Rushing> then in your success callback for the post() call, do callback.apply(this, arguments)
[14:11:36] <crankharder> I'm looking through the API/docs and I dont see any elements that could be used for displaying success/error messages...  are there any?
[14:11:44] <crankharder> ^ for jqueryMobile
[14:11:56] <Rushing> or you could just make callback the argument for the post(), but sometimes you want to do extra stuff
[14:12:24] <b1lly> rushing, hm?
[14:13:26] <Brodingo> HM?
[14:13:29] <Brodingo> HMMMM?
[14:13:34] <thinkt4nk> lmao
[14:13:35] <Rushing> function getDriverRoute_CheckIn(driver_name, callback){ $.post("url", {parmams}, callback);
[14:13:50] <Brodingo> HMMMMMM?
[14:13:57] <thinkt4nk> will do homework for food
[14:14:00] <Brodingo> HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM?
[14:14:00] <Rushing> then from wherever you're calling getDriverRoute_CheckIn(), pass a callback function
[14:14:10] <thinkt4nk> HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHH?!?!?!!!
[14:14:23] <dr34mc0d3r> i have a jquery ui slider - how do i trigger the change event?
[14:14:55] <Rushing> b1lly, you have to realize that hwen you make an ajax call, the code keeps executing, and the code directly after your ajax call doesn't get the response, the callback function does
[14:15:00] <enjoycrf> ?
[14:15:40] <b1lly> rushing, i get that
[14:15:52] <Rushing> apparently not in this code ;P
[14:16:03] <b1lly> i didnt know how to pass the call back back to the function
[14:16:12] <b1lly> the parent function*
[14:16:32] <Rushing> that won't do you any good
[14:16:54] <Rushing> the parent function can't do anything with an async callback
[14:17:11] <b1lly> I basically call a function to execute the post method
[14:17:18] <Rushing> like you can't say var driver_route = getDriverRoute_CheckIn("tony"); var data = driver_route();
[14:17:30] <b1lly> thats what i wanted
[14:17:40] <Rushing> right, won't work lol
[14:17:47] <b1lly> so how do I do it lol
[14:18:36] <Rushing> var data, callback = function(d){ data = d; }; getDriverRoute_CheckIn("tony", callback);
[14:19:11] <b1lly> the callback goes inside the post method?
[14:19:21] <dr34mc0d3r> im using $("#slider").trigger('change', function(){});    how do i trigger the change event of ui slider??
[14:19:34] <Rushing> but assigning data in that scope doesn't really do you much good
[14:20:23] <b1lly> Rushing: you lost me dood
[14:20:42] <Rushing> you have to call getDriverRoute_CheckIn(driver_name, callback), and then whatever you want to happen AFTER the post response is received goes in the callback function you pass
[14:22:50] <duttons> Hi , Could someone have a quick look at a snippet of code and advise best way to tackle hooking into an event to add another function?
[14:23:15] <duttons> I have a pastebin.. at http://pastebin.com/4T5CdKxf
[14:23:46] <jellosea> how do i get the scrollTop of a overflow:scroll div in percentage?
[14:24:47] <enjoycrf> scrollHeight / scrollTop?
[14:25:25] <Rushing> jellosea, you could wrap the inside of the scroll div with another div, then get the height of that inner div
[14:25:57] <Rushing> or you could toggle the height over the container div real quick to get its actual height
[14:26:31] <jellosea> what do you mean by toggle the height over the container?
[14:26:43] <enjoycrf> dont ever overcomplicate things
[14:26:45] <enjoycrf> seriously
[14:26:47] <Rushing> like var height = $(".container").css({visibility:hidden; height:auto;}).height()
[14:26:51] <enjoycrf> bad practice
[14:27:06] <enjoycrf> dood
[14:27:07] <Rushing> yes it is, but it's more tricky than you think. the inner div is the best option
[14:27:14] <jellosea> scrollHeight will work?
[14:27:20] <enjoycrf> its scroltop / scrolltop * 100
[14:27:25] <Rushing> lol enjoycrf, where is he going to get the actual height of the container div?
[14:27:30] <Rushing> there is no scrollHeight
[14:27:33] <enjoycrf> scrollheight
[14:27:37] <enjoycrf> there is
[14:27:51] <enjoycrf> i did it before
[14:28:01] <Rushing> there is a scrollTop and scrollLeft
[14:28:06] <enjoycrf> then
[14:28:14] <enjoycrf> height of the div
[14:28:24] <Rushing> but it has a static height, cause it's scrollable
[14:28:27] <enjoycrf> no there is a scrolheight
[14:28:30] <Rushing> so that's the height that will be returned
[14:28:32] <Rushing> where?
[14:28:37] <jellosea> there is no scrollHeight
[14:28:40] <enjoycrf> dont make me google
[14:28:48] <enjoycrf> i swear
[14:28:56] <jellosea> i justr tried now
[14:29:07] <jellosea> $("#thisDiv").scrollHeight()
[14:29:14] <jellosea> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'scrollHeight'
[14:29:18] <Rushing> enjoycrf, don't make me dissprove you -_-. i am not overcomplicating it. i gave pretty much the only 2 options he has
[14:29:39] <Rushing> ?scrollHeight @ enjoycrf
[14:29:39] <bot-t> enjoycrf, #7542 (scrollWidth/scrollHeight function)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 7 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7542
[14:31:11] <Rushing> so jellosea, back to what i was saying...the trick here is getting the actual dimensions of the content, so an inner div is your best option
[14:31:15] <cool> Hello Everyone!
[14:31:23] <jellosea> yeah
[14:31:25] <jellosea> i will try that
[14:31:25] <jellosea> thanks
[14:31:27] <Rushing> np
[14:32:08] <enjoycrf> Note that the scrollWidth and scrollHeight properties are special for the html element.
[14:32:16] <enjoycrf> durrr
[14:32:27] <cool> Guys, I am trying to get jQuery UI's tab widget working but can't. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/gary4gar/ECqaC/2/
[14:32:51] <enjoycrf> This example illustrates the use of the scrollHeight property:
[14:33:13] <enjoycrf>  var container = document.getElementById ("container");
[14:33:13] <enjoycrf>             
[14:33:13] <enjoycrf>             var message = "The width of the contents width padding: " + container.scrollWidth + "px.\n";
[14:33:13] <enjoycrf>             message += "The height of the contents width padding: " + container.scrollHeight + "px.\n";
[14:33:13] <enjoycrf>             alert (message);
[14:33:40] <snover> enjoycrf: DO NOT paste code in the channel.
[14:34:04] <enjoycrf> omg plz some kill these bots
[14:34:20] <cool> which bot?
[14:34:22] <Rushing> snover is not a bot lol
[14:34:26] <enjoycrf> its like being in a room full of cops
[14:34:44] <fris> what is the difference between the first one and 2nd one? http://pastie.org/2424585
[14:34:47] <snover> or like being in a room full of people that respect netiquette and would like you to do so as well :)
[14:34:54] <cool> enjoycrf: no really, use jsfiddle.net  or pastebin
[14:35:44] <Rushing> fris, looks like they essentially do the same thing
[14:35:49] <Rushing> the first one animates faster
[14:36:00] <Rushing> but both are just animating the scroll position
[14:36:43] <Rushing> it's usually better to use a $("a").live("click", ...) for that though
[14:36:53] <rhizmoe> i'm having some trouble formatting a bunch of li's within a ul in jquery-mobile...is there a reference to expected behavior?
[14:37:02] <rhizmoe> i'm not finding much at test/docs
[14:37:20] <fris> Rushing its for a table of contents scroll from the index
[14:38:01] <Rushing> yeah, still would be good to use live() or delegate() in the context of the TOC links
[14:38:23] <fris> whats all that extra stuff for in the first one, using hash selector etc
[14:38:31] <cool> Guys, I am trying to get jQuery UI's tab widget working but can't. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/gary4gar/ECqaC/2/
[14:38:45] <Rushing> as far as how they're scrolling, one's code is shorter. the second method could give you some issues with external links that have a hash in them
[14:38:51] <Rushing> so you're probably better off using the first method
[14:39:22] <Rushing> fris, for one, it's checking to make sure the hash is relevant to the current domain
[14:39:33] <Rushing> although it'd be even better to make sure it's relevant to the current page
[14:39:45] <Rushing> i'd say both are flawed ;) but the first is less so
[14:40:12] <fris> why do you suggest live click over click?
[14:40:27] <Rushing> cause then it doesn't have to go find all of those anchors and bind to them
[14:40:49] <Rushing> it just creates one listener, then when one is clicked, it bubbles up and if it matches the selector, the listener executes
[14:41:03] <jellosea> so that doesn't really give me a percentage
[14:41:52] <jellosea> Rushing: cos the inner div is a lot bigger than the scrolling div
[14:42:09] <Rushing> jellosea, once you get the full height of the content you're scrolling, you'd do scrollTop/fullHeight * 100
[14:42:19] * cool fixed the problem on his own. He was missing CSS styles
[14:42:56] <jellosea> Rushing: so the scrollbar max scroll is 600px, but hte ocntent im scrolling is like 1200px
[14:43:01] <jellosea> the inner div is 1200px
[14:43:10] <jellosea> i want a percentage of the scrollbar
[14:43:22] <jellosea> if i do that, when its fully scrolled i just get 50 %
[14:43:33] <jellosea> i guess i will factor it
[14:44:07] <Rushing> oh, yeah if you're using some kind of plugin and the max height of the GUI scrollbar is 600, you'll have to do some factoring
[14:44:20] <jellosea> its no plugin
[14:44:25] <jellosea> just fixed hieght div
[14:44:30] <jellosea> overflow: scroll
[14:44:54] <Rushing> then i think scrollTop/fullHeight * 100 should work
[14:45:31] <jellosea> no
[14:45:38] <jellosea> wait
[14:45:40] <jellosea> scrolltop of what
[14:45:46] <jellosea> of the outerdiv? or the inner div
[14:45:57] <jellosea> the outer div is scrollable, inner is not
[14:45:59] <Rushing> outer, i believe
[14:46:06] <jellosea> yeah that doesnt work
[14:46:10] <jellosea> cos max scrollTop is 600px
[14:46:19] <jellosea> and the height of the innerdiv is 1200
[14:46:20] <jellosea> like i said
[14:46:30] <jellosea> so when the thing is completely scrolled, you'l only get 50% scroll
[14:47:28] <Rushing> you might need to say (scrollTop+outerHeight) / fullHeight *100
[14:48:06] <Rushing> and that will tell you the "scrollBottom" basically
[14:50:51] <enjoycrf> u guys seriously wrangling the poor lil scroller still
[14:50:55] <enjoycrf> i told u how
[14:51:07] <Rushing> not the same issue ;)
[14:52:43] <Shambat> Hi, I am using a slideshow: http://pastie.org/2424679 ... however I'm getting the "bug" where the slideshow runs amok because when another tab in the browser is opened, the fadeIn method keeps running, and so when the tab is opened again the slideshow runs really fast to ctach up ... is there some easy fix for this?
[14:55:06] <enjoycrf> fine im in mysql
[14:59:58] <jellosea> Rushing: so this is pretty weird. basically im doing an infinite scrolling box
[15:00:21] <jellosea> Rushing: and initially outer is 600, inner is 1200
[15:00:29] <jellosea> and then when the inner div gets more stuff
[15:00:42] <jellosea> outer scrollTop changes past 600
[15:03:17] <jellosea> sorry
[15:03:23] <rav_> hello. i've started experimenting with jquery and i reached a question i cannot figure out from the websites. i made a table, when you click a row, it opens a dialog with a form to edit the row
[15:03:24] <jellosea> so say inner div becomes 2400
[15:03:35] <jellosea> then the max scroll of the outer div is now 2400
[15:04:38] <rav_> the dialog works well when you submit the form. but when you close it by clicking the X on the corner, the next time the dialog pops up, the dimensions are wrong
[15:05:58] <rav_> should i write a method for the clicking of the X? how?
[15:07:52] <ale> Is there any alternative for eval() for math class?
[15:12:44] <DyeA> alrighty, i'm namespacing my code like a good nerd, first few lines i set a couple of variables up, the third variable i want to set is the size of a set of items I read into the first variable. However I have to reference the first variable with dot notation under the name space and I get not defined. Do I have to just suck it up and query the dom again for the size instead of the set?
[15:13:05] <mstrom> Has anyone ever used AJAX after the click of a link, and the link's refresh messed up your ajax request?

[15:36:40] <niKnight> Question. For what reason would someone write this code? What would you gain by taking an incoming url string variable, creating a DIV and an A tag, set the A tag's href attribute to the url, and then returning the A tags href attribute. This process must act as a filter or something? absolutizeUrl: function(url) { var el = document.createElement('div');	el.innerHTML = '<a href="' + this.escapeHTML(url) + '">x</a>'; return el.firstChi

[16:01:26] <DyeA> Brentonator: attach an event listener on the body tag and cancel any clicks to a fancy box link
[16:01:34] <DyeA> do that first
[16:03:32] <Brentonator> a manual non-jquery one, im assuming.
[16:03:40] <Brentonator> jquery is a big part of the problem that behemoth
[16:03:59] <DyeA> ? no, that should be your first line of code in your document.ready

[16:10:08] <nveid> how can I use the $('input[]') selector when multiple forms exists?
[16:10:17] <b1lly> lets say i wanted to do a $(selector).append('put this input on multiple lines');
[16:10:18] <nveid> and they have similar form values
[16:10:24] <nveid> or names at least
[16:10:37] <b1lly> how do i continue the output on multiple lines?
[16:12:33] <_41Ph4_> b1lly if i understand correctly u need to use the html BR
[16:13:06] <b1lly> no
[16:13:16] <_41Ph4_> nveid, u should do $('#form_id input')
[16:13:51] <nveid> I understand, but I'm trying to attach an onChange event to a class, for a form that could exist twice on a page
[16:13:56] <nveid> but slightly different values inside
[16:13:57] <b1lly> http://pastie.org/2424999
[16:14:22] <nveid> So.. I want to grab basically a hidden input type value off the form to determine how to handle the form
[16:14:48] <macmartine> Why does this fail in IE7? Throws unhelpful error http://jsfiddle.net/JW8ZE/3/
[16:15:19] <_41Ph4_> k, but every form and hidden input should have thier own id
[16:15:21] <_41Ph4_> righT?
[16:15:40] <b1lly> _41Ph4_: did you see my pastie?
[16:15:44] <nveid> Oh I se what your talking about..  could I use something like this _41Ph4..  $(this.form 'input[name=myvalue]')
[16:15:50] <nveid> in the onChange even
[16:15:50] <nveid> t
[16:16:42] <_41Ph4_> what r u appending that to?
[16:16:46] <nveid> one sec.. I'm going to put a hypothetical situation code in a paste bin.. to get ur opinion if it'll work
[16:17:03] <_41Ph4_> div? selecT?
[16:17:20] <nveid> i'm attaching the onChange to a select
[16:18:11] <b1lly> div
[16:18:15] <b1lly> I JUST want the javascript to be able

[16:19:58] <nveid> Very loosely done, but you'd get the just of what I'm trying to do

[17:09:55] <coldhead> make your handler simpler

[17:31:19] <patchwork> hey all, having an issue with jquery-tmpl.  I have a variable that is defined outside an {{each}} block, but inside the each block it is undefined.
[17:31:31] <patchwork> does starting an each block wipe out the previous environment?
[17:31:55] <patchwork> and if so, how do I pass that value in?
[17:39:50] <__machine> i have a click event on a radio button… but it fires twice… anyone know why?
[17:45:39] <dianeinflorida> quick question if I have a static list <li><a href="#ldetails>Joe Schmo</li>.  Here is the question.  I have my data in an xml file.  How do i load the ldetails page using the last name
[17:47:01] <__machine> if i put the click on the radio input, i get two clicks with the radio as the target… if i put the click on the label, i get one click with the label as the target and one with the input as the target… how can i put the click on the label (so i can click on the label text) but fire only once with the radio (or the label) as the target?

[18:11:24] <dv310p3r> I'm looking for a word that I see used often and I try to code that way as well, for some reason i forgot the word though, it means to code in a way that would allow older browsers to still see your site nicely even if it doesn't support a feature your using.

[18:20:15] <dravekx> montanaflynn what's the difference between that way and using the UI?
[18:23:31] <__machine> i have a click event on a radio button… it fires twice (because of the label sending an event to the radio)… i prevent that with e.stopImmediatePropagation() … but i only want the event to fire once… so i also do $(this).unbind(e); … but the event fires on the second click as well, and is only unbound for the 3rd click?
[18:39:26] <detain> doing  $(".blah").each(function() {   to iterate thorugh and get some values .. but some of them start off as like  true  and wind up all oddly quoted   like "\"true\""
[18:39:38] <detain> what might i be doing wrong or what can i do to fix that
[18:39:50] <detain> .escape( ?
[18:40:03] <coldhead> where do they wind up like that?
[18:40:07] <coldhead> on the server?
[18:40:19] <detain> input radio box value
[18:40:21] <coldhead> i've never known js to escape stuff
[18:40:44] <coldhead> only nasty servers
[18:40:51] <coldhead> you got a link?
[18:41:23] <danieliser> i am building a php app and using tables to display data.. most tables > tr will be clickable and im using $('table.ajax').delegate("tbody > tr", "dblclick", function()); to ajax a dialog..
[18:41:37] <detain> not atm ill work on getitng  a fiddle up
[18:41:49] <danieliser> each table needs a different ajax url.. should i use html5 data or is there a better way?
[18:43:10] <danieliser> client table links opens clients/info/client id.. where as notes table should be notes/view/note id..
[18:43:59] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/FFusd/  (this is a working example of a working voting form) I am wondering if I can get some input on how to improve the user experience if at all possible
[18:45:33] <ale> What can I use istead of eval for Math expressions?
[18:46:18] <danieliser> does the jquery Math functions not work for your needs?
[18:51:04] <GoGoGarrett> :[
[18:51:58] <danieliser> any ideas how i can crossbrowser atatch a url to a table?
[19:02:30] <Moridine> danieliser: what do you mean by attach to a table?
[19:02:53] <__machine> to select a new radio button (without triggering a click event) do i need to set checked attr on the new one and remove it from old one, or can i just set the val of the form field or something else?
[19:05:54] <danieliser> each table needs an ajax url.. clients talbe has url of clients/info/, notes is notes/view/ etc.. each table row is clickable and loads that url with its items id
[19:07:27] <danieliser> i guess im gonna use .data() and add the urls as data-ajax-url attributes to the tables..
[19:10:18] <Moridine> danieliser: not sure if this helps but I set a url attribute on the rows
[19:10:25] <Moridine> which breaks standards
[19:10:27] <Moridine> but.. meh
[19:11:07] <Moridine> but that isn't ajax, so probably doesn't help you I guess
[19:19:44] <danieliser> i used data-ajax-url="" on the table tag itself. all rows use the same url so it would be a waste of space for it to be every row..
[19:25:43] <nveid> can I use a selector with jquery ready?
[19:26:15] <nveid> like.. $('selector').ready(function() { code… });
[19:29:00] <letterpress> only if the selector is document
[19:29:47] <letterpress> perhaps you're looking for .load()
[19:30:43] <deadghost> simple plain js question
[19:30:47] <deadghost> document.getElementById("coolspider").src = dir + imageArray[i]; works
[19:30:54] <nveid> yes, I think so
[19:31:16] <deadghost> however
[19:31:24] <deadghost> imageId.src doesn't
[19:31:35] <deadghost> http://pastebin.com/755M1sVr
[19:33:07] <deadghost> wait nvm I think I see my problem
[19:35:29] <nveid> If I'm trying to bind a .load event to a class, do I need to use .each?
[19:37:19] <nveid> http://pastebin.com/6Jzn0wtx
[19:37:46] <nveid> its not working correctly
[19:48:33] <Moridine> nveid: did you get it working?
[19:48:39] <nveid> nope
[19:48:44] <Moridine> nveid didn't you mean $(this) rather than just "this" ?
[19:49:03] <nveid> thats the same code i have in a .change event for that class
[19:49:21] <nveid> thing is on one form the code is a hidden input box, while the other is a select box
[19:49:37] <nveid> so the running .change() at the end didn't want to work
[19:51:27] <letterpress> nveid is your code somewhere to look at?
[19:54:17] <nveid> in a bit.. gotta fix some other stuff for a client first, thanks though
[19:55:01] <fission6> anyone have a rec for a jqueyry image cropper?
[19:55:12] <letterpress> np. and to answer your earlier question no you don't need to run an each on a selector for the load event.
[20:02:58] <nveid> letterpress: mind taking at look now?
[20:07:52] <letterpress> nveid np where is it?
[20:10:48] <nveid> its the new car search form on the page.. below the forms you will see a .one('load'
[20:10:57] <nveid> err.. one("load"
[20:11:37] <nveid> previously before I changed it to a hidden select box for new car search, the <select> method worked with .change()
[20:24:30] <rhizmoe> with jq mobile, how much of the ui-* classes are manual vs. automatically applied?
[20:24:45] <rhizmoe> i'm having a devil of a time getting a listview to format nicely
[20:43:16] <rhizmoe> well, manual css overrides are one way about it
[20:46:50] <detain> stuck using php < 5.3  which doesnt have the special js complaint json_encode() , any ways aroudn this ?: i mgetting keys with quotes around them and thats more orlesss the problem
[20:50:44] <poot> if i'm dynamically loading pages with jQuery.load() is there a way to run a function if the page does not exist ?
[20:51:17] <coldhead> you should be able to use the error handler for load
[20:51:21] <coldhead> assuming it has one
[20:51:23] <coldhead> which i would
[20:51:24] <coldhead> ?load
[20:51:24] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/

[20:52:03] <poot> haha
[20:52:23] <coldhead> okay if you look here http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:52:28] <poot> ok so status == "error"
[20:52:35] <coldhead> ja!
[20:52:38] <poot> thx
[20:52:38] <coldhead> good work
[20:52:41] <poot> i did it

[21:08:53] <abjorn> unf unf
[21:10:23] * mbrevda_ wonders if there is a pure css replacement for most of the query-ui images
[21:13:30] <DyeA> $(this).sucks()
[21:16:32] <abjorn> @mbrevda_: Sure, for some of it, but not all of it. And it would make it more difficult to customize a theme.
[21:16:46] <abjorn> Not to mention not as backwards compatible ;)
[21:17:51] <mbrevda_> abjorn: obviously not all (say icons), but for the backgrounds of, like, ui-widget-header there is absolutely no reason/need for an image
[21:18:03] <abjorn> you're probably right

[21:33:16] <scorphus> good evening everyone
[21:36:50] <manhunter> hi
[21:36:59] <scorphus> does anyone hate CSS more than I truly do?
[21:37:00] <manhunter> i have division like this, http://pastebin.com/6rR3Cdz2
[21:37:34] <manhunter> i want to view all upto five division but from the six division all will be slidedDown
[21:38:36] <manhunter> and how can i select the 3rd next division ?
[21:38:51] <EMKO> how do i load a page and when its done refresh the page im on? trying to get make it so when i click login with google it will just login and refresh the page im on
[21:39:08] <manhunter> EMKO: for me ?
[21:39:10] <scorphus> manhunter: $('#rightsideone').next().next()
[21:39:10] <EMKO> with just php it goes to blank page and redirects a few times
[21:39:31] <manhunter> scorphus: is there anything like .next(2) ?
[21:39:45] <scorphus> not sure =/
[21:39:47] <manhunter> is there any alternative to this ? .next().next().next()
[21:40:28] <scorphus> maybe $('#rightside').children()[2] ?
[21:40:32] <scorphus> not sure as well =/
[21:42:11] <manhunter> scorphus: how can i get all slidedown after rightsidedivfive ?
[21:42:47] <scorphus> manhunter: I'd set an specific class to them
[21:43:00] <scorphus> say hiddenDivision
[21:43:11] <scorphus> set display:none in the (damn) CSS
[21:43:21] <aaairc> if i have a jquery selector... and it doesn't find anything... what does jquery return?
[21:43:27] <EMKO> anyone have any ideas i can do this? i have tried with post but the problem is it just stops on the page i set it to post to instead of waiting for it to complete
[21:44:29] <scorphus> and $('.hiddenDivision').click(function() { $(this).slideToggle() });
[21:44:31] <aaairc>  for example... var selectedDiv = $('#id_that_doesnt_exist');    ... in that case what would selectedDiv be equal too
[21:44:40] <scorphus> null?
[21:45:23] <manhunter> scorphus: yes  i can hide
[21:45:24] <scorphus> aaairc: try with console.log($('#id_that_doesnt_exist')); and check what it displays, maybe null or undefined
[21:45:36] <manhunter> scorphus: how can i hide after fifth div
[21:45:38] <scorphus> aaairc: sorry, I'm no expert
[21:45:41] <aaairc> yeah i'm going to check
[21:45:43] <aaairc> thnx
[21:45:53] <scorphus> manhunter: with the CSS
[21:46:05] <scorphus> ah, wait
[21:46:27] <scorphus> what is it that make them to slideDown?
[21:46:31] <scorphus> manhunter: ^
[21:47:58] <scorphus> aaairc: don't forget to use FireBug, although I'm sure you didn't forget =)
[21:48:59] <aaairc> its an empty object
[21:49:03] <aaairc> with length zero
[21:49:04] <aaairc> not null
[21:49:09] <manhunter> scorphus: how can i all divs after fifth div ?
[21:49:10] <scorphus> oh
[21:49:30] <manhunter> scorphus: http://pastebin.com/6rR3Cdz2  there are many divs inside these
[21:49:40] <danheberden> $( 'div' ).slice(4).hide();
[21:50:14] <manhunter> scorphus: rightsidesix, rightsideseven, rightsideeight etc will be hidden
[21:50:40] <manhunter> scorphus: rightsidesix, rightsideseven, rightsideeight etc will be hidden , there are many divs inside rightsidesix, rightsideseven, rightsideeight ..
[21:52:57] <scorphus> manhunter: yep, I got that, I'm trying a bit over here, just a sec and I'll get back to you =)
[21:56:46] <scorphus> manhunter: here you go, thanks to danheberden: http://jsfiddle.net/5a6SG/
[21:57:30] <maxaud1> Hello, does anyone know how I can get the second set of tabs to auto-rotate like the first set? http://jsfiddle.net/VVEfS/ It seems only the first set on a page will auto-rotate.
[22:01:26] <EMKO> my problem is when i click login with google it goes to /auth/google_openid_signin wich checkes some stuff and redirects to /auth/google_openind_signin?huge get parameters. so ive got it to only load up to the /auth/google_openid_sign and it stops here
[22:03:05] <da-beginner> hi guys.. what is better practice, to put all the click event scripts inside or outside document.ready function?
[22:07:07] <manhunter> alert($("#rightside").children()) ; shows object Object , how can i get the value ?
[22:07:20] <manhunter> which element are selected ? how can i know this ?
[22:07:41] <manhunter> scorphus: [object Object]
[22:08:09] <manhunter> scorphus: how can i get which html tags are selected with $("#rightside").children()
[22:08:53] <maxaud1> manhunter: maybe try .each
[22:09:14] <poot> da-beginner inside, to make sure the page has loaded before adding listeners
[22:09:42] <poot> is there a way to disable something from being hidden from a .hide() call?
[22:09:54] <da-beginner> poot: even with live( ) listeners?
[22:10:03] <poot> yep its the same thing
[22:10:28] <maxaud1> manhunter: $("#rightside").children().each(function () { alert($(this).text()); });
[22:10:41] <da-beginner> poot: then can you explain this article from pagespeed regarding minimising payload size? http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/payload.html#DeferLoadingJS
[22:11:41] <Qbix1> hey guys
[22:11:49] <Qbix1> I can't just use jquery events without DOM elements can I?
[22:12:23] <Qbix1> just on objects
[22:13:19] <shaft0> Is there a way to load a function after dynamic content is loaded?  I'm using delegate for clickable items and that's working well, but basically what I have going on is content outputs to a div, jquery takes that content and puts it elsewhere, and then I want to apply pagination to that, but I can't seem to get it to apply
[22:14:18] <poot> da-beginner well, its explaining how scripts are loaded during initial page load, and so if you have a huge javascript file that contains lots of script that isnt completely necessary for initial page load (like stuff you do on click or mouse move) ... that those functions should be placed in another js file that gets loaded only when needed. to speed up initial page load
[22:16:06] <Qbix1> what does .trigger do if there are elements bound? it walks the dom?
[22:16:07] <shaft0> It works when I type in the function into the console, so I know the code itself is "good", but it won't work with code that has already had jquery applied.
[22:16:09] <Qbix1> DFS?
[22:19:12] <da-beginner> poot: loaded only when needed? so not using <script src=""> but something like includeScript function?
[22:19:26] <shaft0> Probably would've helped if I had spelled the identifier right in the script hahaha
[22:20:21] <da-beginner> poot: sorry, i've found the example on the page :)
[22:20:42] <poot> yeah, it just adds the script include to the top of the page
[22:20:53] <poot> pretty smart, thanks for linking
[22:21:08] <coldhead> bot-t: tell dyea $(ur).fat()
[22:21:09] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[22:21:12] <coldhead> thanks bro
[22:22:52] <danieliser> got this json object {"errors":{"firstname":"The First Name field cannot be left blank.","lastname":"The Last Name field cannot be left blank.","phonenumber":"Please enter at least one Phone Number."}}
[22:23:35] <danieliser> how do i access the error name and message in .each(object.errors)?
[22:27:41] <aaairc> using history.js ... does anyone know the difference between pushState and replaceState?
[22:29:21] <aaairc> nevermind, think i got it... if you do replaceState then the state your replacing can't be used with the backbutton... there will supposedly be no history of it
[22:29:51] <manhunter> how can i select a division with a class inside another division ?
[22:30:40] <scorphus> manhunter: $('#firstDiv').find('#findMeDiv')
[22:30:46] <scorphus> oops...
[22:30:51] <scorphus> manhunter: $('#firstDiv').find('.findMeDiv')
[22:32:55] <EMKO> i guess what im trying to do is impossible :( googled all day
[22:37:14] <shichuan> i have a question about core.js
[22:37:24] <dr0id> why not jquery.js ?
[22:37:37] <coldhead> maybe it's just that specific bit
[22:37:49] <shichuan> well, it could be the same :)
[22:39:59] <dr0id> Hey coldhead
[22:40:01] <dr0id> how goes it
[22:40:01] <shichuan> what's the reason of doing:
[22:40:02] <shichuan> jQuery.fn = jQuery.prototype = {
[22:40:02] <shichuan> }
[22:40:02] <shichuan> jQuery.fn.init.prototype = jQuery.fn;
[22:40:28] <shichuan> i can understand how it works, but why
[22:41:01] <coldhead> that's very core
[22:41:09] <coldhead> hi dr0id
[22:41:22] <scorphus> yo dr0id, long time no talk, how's it goin?
[22:41:33] <dr0id> do I know you kind sir ?
[22:41:49] <dr0id> its goin well though!
[22:42:01] <dr0id> and Hi All!
[22:42:30] <shichuan> coldhead: i know it's core, just wanna know if there is any specific reason to use this pattern, maybe some historical reason?
[22:42:38] <scorphus> dr0id: hehe, personally not, but we've talked here some time ago...
[22:43:00] <coldhead> i have no idea, shichuan, it's my first day using jQuery
[22:43:02] <dr0id> nice
[22:43:20] <coldhead> i was just admiring that you knew exactly where that code was
[22:43:51] <scorphus> dr0id: "<dr0id> so, I did alert(form.serialize()); and could see the html data from tinymce there. how can I access it from the string ?" and so on...
[22:43:55] <scorphus> not sure when thou
[22:44:06] <dr0id> righto, gotcha
[22:44:14] <dr0id> back in March
[22:44:18] <ralphholzmann> shichuan: its just a shortcut to the prototype
[22:44:28] <ralphholzmann> for easier plugin making
[22:44:34] <ralphholzmann> $.fn.pluginName
[22:44:36] <ralphholzmann> is the same as
[22:44:38] <dr0id> scorphus: :)
[22:44:45] <ralphholzmann> $.prototype.pluginName
[22:45:37] <scorphus> dr0id: exactly, good memory! (I checked my logs, thou, hehe...)
[22:45:50] <dr0id> Heh ;)
[22:46:09] <dr0id> .seen doonie
[22:46:10] <hsbot> doonie was seen 3 months, 2 weeks and 5 days ago, quitting with the message: Quit: Leaving.
[22:46:36] <shichuan> ralphholzmann: yea, i figure it's mainly used to enable the use of selectors in plugins.
[22:48:12] <EMKO> when i type /auth/google_openid_login this will do some checks and then it will redirect to its self with get parameters like /auth_other/google_openid_signin?openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2 what happens with javascript is it will just stop on the /auth/google_openid_login page
[22:48:36] <EMKO> anyway to get the ajax to wait for the refreshed page?
[22:49:09] <scorphus> EMKO: maybe inside an iframe
[22:49:36] <EMKO> same it just stops on the page i load
[22:49:38] <scorphus> EMKO: I've been thinking about you problem since you first asked =)
[22:49:55] <EMKO> im going crazy all day trying to figure this out
[22:50:25] <scorphus> EMKO: you'll have to set a timeout and keep checking for the iframe address
[22:50:28] <scorphus> not sure thou
[22:50:42] <scorphus> EMKO: any code so far?
[22:52:59] <EMKO> not really i have tried many ways
[22:54:13] <scorphus> EMKO: yeah,  know what it's like

[23:06:55] <K1NET1K> hi, easy question. can anyone recommend a good site for basic free jquery plugins like a slideshow gallery
[23:07:10] <K1NET1K> or a portal where i can browse many plugins
[23:07:13] <iszak> oh I don't know, perhaps.. plugins.jquery.com ?
[23:07:17] <menak> :)
[23:07:23] <coldhead> CI
[23:07:29] <K1NET1K> oh lol sweet :), google often doesnt find things
[23:07:39] <iszak> coldhead, how's Australia btw? and OMG CI I pledge my allegiance.
[23:07:51] <scorphus> coldhead: yeah!
[23:08:33] <menak> K1NET1K: thats the first result for "jquery plugins" :)
[23:09:12] <scorphus> EMKO: do you have control over the page that gets refreshed? I mean, can it change anything or call some JS after being refreshed?
[23:09:24] <K1NET1K> thanks for not flaming me too much :)
[23:10:00] <EMKO> yes it could call javascript when its done refreshing
[23:10:53] <K1NET1K> bah i just want to see previews of these plugins without having to click on each one :( maybe plugins.jquery.com could invest some time in their own site
[23:11:10] <EMKO> i just want the user to click login with google and log the user in without leaving the page
[23:11:52] <EMKO> i just made a iframe without javascript and it works wtf
[23:13:34] <EMKO> i guess i will load a iframe on clicking the login button and hide it and when its doen loading refresh the page so the user is logedin
[23:14:09] <scorphus> EMKO: good, glad it woks!
[23:14:13] <SIDU> coldhead: i only resize grid horizontally, do i still have to download jq-ui plugin? that ui looks heavy and off course does all resize jobs
[23:14:47] <EMKO> ok thanks guys
[23:17:19] <K1NET1K> omfg this jquery plugins page hasa lot of stuff, but the interface is horrible
[23:17:31] <K1NET1K> it randowmly picks bits of the descriptions
[23:27:12] <coldhead> GUH

[23:39:49] <SIDU> Guest82075: this.id
[23:40:02] <Guest82075> SIDU: I tried that, didn't work
[23:40:17] <SIDU> Guest82075: $(this).attr('id')
[23:40:24] <Guest82075> SIDU: console log gives me undefined
[23:40:47] <Guest82075> SIDU: Still nothing, with "$(this).attr('id')"
[23:41:01] <Guest82075> SIDU: wait let me paste it to jsfiddle or something
