[00:22:30] <Whirl3d> Good Evening all
[00:27:10] <Whirl3d> Hello?
[00:41:13] <dean[w]> Can anyone help me with this jQuery bug. It's been hassling me for over 12 hours now. See how when I pick up the item, the font-size increases which is correct,  but when I drop it, the font-size goes down temporarily and then back up again: http://jsfiddle.net/yLZ7Z/
[00:46:12] <pouete> Hello everyone !
[00:47:29] <pouete> In jquery, is it possible to have a dom tree in a variable and use jquery selectors on it ?
[00:50:31] <blackspotwiggins> pouete, yes
[00:50:33] <iSeeDeadPixels> i'm having issues with the flot jquery plugin, it f*cks up on a resize
[00:50:55] <pouete> blackspotwiggins: how do you do that ? any doc page i should read ?
[00:51:55] <blackspotwiggins> pouete, $(dom).find("something")
[00:55:07] <pouete> blackspotwiggins: is it working the same with a id="something" ? like : $(dom).$("#something") ?
[00:57:07] <blackspotwiggins> pouete, that's not what i wrote, now was it

[03:26:21] <mbn_18> Hi, how can I limit jquery autocomplete to accept only values that are within his suggestions?
[03:29:03] <radify> mbn_18: check that the value exists then either remove it from textbox or deny user action, I guess the autocomplete is AJAX-based, in which case you should be sending another GET request to check if the value entered is accepted

[03:37:05] <dragongun100> where is the german location for jquery?
[03:38:06] <radify> noregret: the code on that page is irrelevant, does #res_eList definitely exist on the page, and if so what type of elem is it?
[03:52:03] <JaredCE> I have a standard select box with options in... how would i find the position a certain option is in that list if i know the text in it.. so like <option id="3">ban</option><option id="10">car</option>, if i know car how would i get the position 2 back?

[04:12:14] <JaredCE> radify: thanks for that... Why does this return me -1 though: console.log($("lstTribeIDs").find('option:'+item.label).index());
[04:15:40] <JaredCE> just not the correct way to do it?
[04:15:59] <rgr> Is it possible in jq to assign, say a click, to classes, instances of which will be created later?
[04:16:27] <Zogot> rgr: .on()
[04:16:42] <rgr> I#ll google it . thanks.
[04:17:34] <anli_> Should I use new FormData() or new window.FormData()?
[04:20:17] <rgr> Zogot: on() only appears to work for existin elements
[04:21:42] <Zogot> rgr: Theres 2 ways to use .on(), 1 way similar to .click or .bind or so, the other is as the old way .live() used to be
[04:22:00] <rgr> live() seems to be what I want.
[04:22:10] <Zogot> .on() replaces .live()
[04:22:11] <rgr> oh, its deprecated. I see.
[04:22:34] <rgr> sorym running on really really slow mobile tether here. things delayed.
[04:22:53] <Zogot> $('.container').on('click', 'p', function() {});
[04:23:33] <Zogot> something like that.  Container is the element that will have the generated "p" tag (so its listening to what happens inside of .container, and then attaches the click method to it, simply put
[04:24:09] <rgr> oh I see. Well explained. The doc was like wading through treacle.
[04:24:38] <goschtl> hi i have an input field for german time which has this format  HH:MM
[04:24:55] <goschtl> now i want not to type in the ":"
[04:25:13] <goschtl> is there a plugin for this kind of placeholder/mask
[04:25:33] <goschtl> i just want to type 1256 and it should be 12:56
[04:25:37] <Zogot> goschtl: For a timesheet system I made for my current work, it was just something I did server side
[04:26:27] <rgr> he wants it client side so it looks right I assume
[04:26:42] <goschtl> Zogot: thanks but it should be clientside...
[04:27:20] <Gx4> hi
[04:27:30] <Zogot> goschtl: What I meant, as because after they pressed update, the page refreshed and showed with the : (with the formating applied server side)
[04:28:21] <rgr> that would be horrible.That said I think they should type it. I hate "smart" input templates ;)
[04:28:25] <iSeeDeadPixels> what is the best way to get all current values from form items on load and putting every form's item's data into their respective spans somewhere else on the page?
[04:28:38] <iSeeDeadPixels> form element name: 1, span class: .sumPakket
[04:29:27] <iSeeDeadPixels> i want to have a $('input[name=1').something(do stuff), is that possbile?
[04:29:36] <iSeeDeadPixels> .each() maybe?
[04:30:40] <rgr> you dont make much sense I'm afraid. serialize the form and calculate the destination input name based on form field name and pass the value
[04:31:20] <AdamPDotty> hmm, why not each?
[04:31:44] <iSeeDeadPixels> rgr, let me get you a fiddle
[04:31:59] <Gx4> I have a dropdown area that has checkboxes in it, the dropdown area closes on checkbox click, although I'd like it to stay because I want to select multiple checkboxes, I used stopPropagation() but then checkboxes stopped working, any suggestions?
[04:34:22] <iSeeDeadPixels> rgr: http://jsfiddle.net/dtLgD/
[04:34:52] <iSeeDeadPixels> 2 pages of data, 1 page with a summary / shopping cart
[04:36:10] <AdamPDotty> hehe that fiddle again
[04:36:57] <iSeeDeadPixels> improved
[04:37:30] <soahccc> Anybody knows a ckeditor related channel? Freaking out writing plugins for it
[04:37:46] <AdamPDotty> fine, I did not try yet, but I would go with $.each('input',' doStuffFunction');
[04:38:38] <iSeeDeadPixels> hmmee
[04:38:42] <iSeeDeadPixels> hmmm... *
[04:38:54] <AdamPDotty> get the name of this and work with $('.gotName')
[04:40:04] <pangelovski> hi guys, I'm getting a strange message saying unsupported pseudo: jqmData. anyone else experienced this?
[04:40:46] <AdamPDotty> you used :jgmData
[04:40:54] <AdamPDotty> maybe you meant .jqmData?
[04:43:23] <Caraveo> Hi, I am trying to get JSON data displayed in console as an object. This is what I have so far:
[04:43:24] <Caraveo> $("#json").on("click", function(){
[04:43:24] <Caraveo> 	$.ajax({
[04:43:24] <Caraveo> 		url      : "xhr/data.json",
[04:43:24] <Caraveo> 		type     : "GET",
[04:43:24] <Caraveo> 		dataType : "json",
[04:43:25] <Caraveo> 		success  : function(result){
[04:43:25] <Caraveo> 			console.log(result);
[04:43:26] <Caraveo> 		}
[04:43:26] <Caraveo> 	});
[04:43:27] <Caraveo> });
[04:43:39] * AdamPDotty slaps Caraveo around a bit with a large trout
[04:43:49] <seutje> ?paste
[04:43:50] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:49:11] <AdamPDotty> ping
[04:51:49] <caraveo_> http://jsfiddle.net/5H67M/
[04:51:52] <caraveo_> Anyone?
[04:51:59] <caraveo_> I would appreciate any help
[04:52:31] <caraveo_> It seems like, to me that the success function is not being executed.
[04:52:58] <caraveo_> if this is elementary stuff i apologize.
[04:53:25] <caraveo_> I would however appreciate any link to any useful resources
[04:55:11] <soahccc> Well hope some expert might help... Tried this but this example seems to be broken (Uncaught TypeError: Object timestamp has no method 'replace')... http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Tutorials/Timestamp_Plugin
[04:55:30] <AdamPDotty> I am new to jqeury mobile, but doesnt data-ajax="false" prevent the link from firing?
[04:57:08] <AdamPDotty> CKEDITOR should not be of type timestamp
[04:57:44] <caraveo_> I used a console.log to see if the anchor #json was binding/on/click it returned the message everytime i clicked the anchor.
[04:58:26] <caraveo_> Also, the file loads into the DOM(i think thats the right term) XHR as it comes up in resources but data.json is empty
[04:58:41] <caraveo_> ofcourse i checked it and my json data is there.
[04:59:44] <caraveo_> https://github.com/Caraveo/ASDI/blob/gh-pages/Week%202/xhr/data.json
[05:00:37] <jacta> what have I done wrong here since my example wont work? http://jsfiddle.net/X5CSQ/
[05:01:23] <AdamPDotty> caraveo: success is deprecated in 1.8 but should still work
[05:01:34] <AdamPDotty> else I dont see anything wrong
[05:01:37] <AdamPDotty> maybe someone else
[05:03:22] <seutje> caraveo_: are you sure your server is sending it as json, coz it works fine on fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/5H67M/1/
[05:03:54] <seutje> oh wait a second
[05:03:57] <AdamPDotty> jacta: does the ul carousel?
[05:04:06] <AdamPDotty> not the image?
[05:05:08] <jacta> AdamPDotty, seems like my js is not attached ?
[05:05:31] <AdamPDotty> its in global scope
[05:05:40] <AdamPDotty> I dont know, if the fiddle waits for dom.ready
[05:06:04] <seutje> caraveo_: odd, data does seem to be empty
[05:06:12] <caraveo_> AdamPDotty I appreciate your enthusiasm to help out, honestly.
[05:06:44] <AdamPDotty> I am trying
[05:07:31] <AdamPDotty> jacta: I suggest $('.ImgContainer ul').ready()
[05:08:19] <JaredCE> does anyone use chosen here?
[05:09:33] <caraveo_> What's chosen?
[05:09:35] <sahbeewah> caraveo_, your json file shouldn't have the declaration there
[05:10:08] <sjeijk> did google just changed its interface?
[05:11:40] <caraveo_> sahbeewah, no var decleration
[05:12:25] <caraveo_> What is the proper way to start JSON?
[05:14:14] <sahbeewah> what do you mean start JSON?
[05:14:24] <caraveo_> I mean to start a Json object
[05:14:43] <caraveo_> thats redundant
[05:14:46] <caraveo_> ;\
[05:15:28] <caraveo_> I am trying to create a data.json file that can be pulled using $.ajax
[05:15:45] <caraveo_> What is the proper syntax to format the json file?
[05:16:08] <jugglinmike> caraveo_: check out http://json.org/ for diagrams on proper JSON formatting
[05:16:13] <sahbeewah> it's just the json string
[05:16:31] <sahbeewah> { "key": "value", ... }
[05:17:05] <jugglinmike> there are other forms, sahbeewah
[05:17:14] <jugglinmike> [ "value", 2, [] ]
[05:17:50] <caraveo_> an object and an array
[05:18:40] <caraveo_> brb i need some coffee
[05:19:17] <caraveo_> I still haven't figured out why the data.json file is coming up empty in browser resources.
[05:19:20] <sahbeewah> yes thanks i'm aware of that
[05:20:00] <sahbeewah> open the url via your browser
[05:20:50] <sahbeewah> address bar i mean
[05:21:54] <caraveo_> for what purpose?
[05:22:09] <keirlav87> I am making an app that will load json from my server, contained within that will be collections of data to build markers on a google maps map, the client short polls for the data every 5 seconds, but I don't want to rebuild my markers on each poll, only if the state has changed, what would be a good way to approach this - create a localstorage object for my markers and bind an event to update the map when that changes? if thats 
[05:22:46] <sahbeewah> caraveo_, to determine whether you're actually specifying the correct url, and to see what the response is
[05:23:11] <sahbeewah> you can also determine from that whether the json is well-formed
[05:23:16] <themojowill> I have built a pricing slider using jQuery UI slider, it is working great, I want to now be able to add a number of images based on the slider input so if the slider shows 4 4 images fade in if it goes to 3 one image fades out etc, can anyone help?
[05:23:58] <caraveo_> sahbeewah when i pull it up in a browser the I cans see my data,
[05:25:53] <sahbeewah> i can see the var json = is still there
[05:29:07] <caraveo_> I trieed removing it and expirementing but the results are the same
[05:30:06] <anli_> I have created some buttons with script inside <form>:s, I am now using e.preventDefault(), e.stopPropagation() and return false, they still submit the form
[05:30:17] <anli_> I have no idea how to prevent them from doing that
[05:31:02] <anli_> I add click handlers with btn.click
[05:31:07] <anli_> instead of having onclick
[05:31:46] <jugglinmike> anli_: two things
[05:32:18] <jugglinmike> Check out the jquery api documentation for "preventDefault" and "stopPropegation" (and how they relate to return false)
[05:32:38] <anli_> return false has been enough before
[05:32:41] <jugglinmike> It's much better if you understand each and use them appropriately, as opposed to just trying everything to solve your problem
[05:32:56] <jugglinmike> "return false" will work here
[05:33:02] <jugglinmike> but it will do more than you likely need
[05:33:02] <anli_> I understand them both, what to do now?
[05:33:18] <anli_> return false did not prevent the form from submitting
[05:33:26] <jugglinmike> You need to attach the handler to the "submit" event of the form you've created
[05:33:26] <jugglinmike> for instance
[05:33:30] <sahbeewah> caraveo_, you can't have trailing commas on the last element of an object
[05:33:40] <jugglinmike> $("#form").on("submit", myHandler)
[05:35:04] <jugglinmike> call "event.preventDefault()" from that handler anli_
[05:36:01] <caraveo_> Well thanks for your help guys
[05:37:05] <anli_> yeah, read about return false now, it uses preventDefault and stopPropagation
[05:37:16] <anli_> But return false is a clean way of expressing yourself, I think
[05:37:58] <jugglinmike> It also effects control flow, which can make your code less readable
[05:38:10] <anli_> I disagree it would be less readable
[05:38:15] <jugglinmike> but as long as you understand how it works, it's really up to you
[05:38:19] <anli_> you dont need an incoming event object using return false
[05:38:24] <anli_> the mass of code is less
[05:38:49] <jugglinmike> Did that fix your problem anli_?
[05:38:53] <anli_> I had misspelled, therefore return false "did not work"
[05:38:56] <anli_> yeah, I think so
[05:38:58] <anli_> thanks :)
[05:39:02] <jugglinmike> np
[05:39:27] <anli_> I also found the article about return false :)
[05:40:01] <j_ayen_green> I have the need to pass a code on a click event. Being a CMS, the container is not aware of its contents, and sometimes I need to use the code from the container, but sometimes from its contents. The container gets processed first, so in the case where contents matter, I do .unbind('click') and then .click(). When I click, the container bind is still there.
[05:41:01] <Alex_7> trying to perform a google search with ajax but am just getting in problem with XMLHttpRequest cannot load, Origin http://localhost is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin

[05:42:32] <AdamPDotty> no way to steal from google
[05:43:14] <Alex_7> AdamPDotty, I don't have any intention to steal anything
[05:43:38] <Alex_7> Is there some way to work around this issue?
[05:43:53] <anli_> stealing == web development
[05:44:38] <AdamPDotty> not with jquery, with a webserver its still possible
[05:44:51] <juboba> I'm using jeditable to edit some information. Is it possible to get the element inside the $('.editable').editable( <HERE>}); statement? I mean I'm trying to use $(this).parent() inside, but it doesn't work.
[05:45:09] <Alex_7> how?
[05:48:20] <AdamPDotty> bascially you use php readfile for example to read the page and so mirror it
[05:48:38] <AdamPDotty> or you even extract data in php and print xml
[05:48:54] <AdamPDotty> then its on the same domain and jquery can access it
[05:51:34] <j_ayen_green> Let me ask another way. If I have a link that has .click() assigned from a selector by a grandparent, and then later select the same link via its parent and .unbind('click'), should that unbind the original click event even though the link was originally selected in a different way?
[05:54:19] <AdamPDotty> .click() should work on element, not selector
[05:56:26] <mbn_18> is it possible to change autocomplete onchange event from blur to onkeyup?
[05:57:17] <roel> if I bind a click event with .on() will this click event be removed from the memory if I remove the element? or should I first use .off and then remove the element?
[06:00:57] <j_ayen_green> AdamPDotty: I agree. But the unbind is not working.
[06:02:11] <j_ayen_green> each bind uses a function passing the code from the (grand)parent. So when I unbind and then rebind using the new code, that is what should be passed when I click, but I get the code from the original bind.

[06:12:15] <Trudko> Guys I am using autocomplete component, http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ . Is there way how to use select listener with delegate? I am planning to clone this element so I need to use delegate function but I am not sure how to combine those two
[06:12:39] <Trudko> hopefully you know what I am saying
[06:24:21] <Thomas____> hi I have a quick question. I have bound some events to an element using the .on() function and they work fine. Now for some reason trying to unbind them with off doens't seem to work. What could be the cause?
[06:25:03] <pachet> what was the event? and what was the selector you used?
[06:25:06] <juboba> I'm using jeditable to edit some information. Is it possible to get the element inside the $('.editable').editable( <HERE>}); statement? I mean I'm trying to use $(this).parent() inside, but it doesn't work.
[06:25:20] <nights> hi guys
[06:25:55] <AdamPDotty> juboba; why parent? isnt "this" what you are looking for?
[06:26:00] <hlve> mornin nights
[06:26:18] <nights> im trying to populate a select with ajax data by using the html() attribute. i want to include the selected element as one of the options, any idea how i can do it? (without looping through and selecting etc)
[06:27:38] <Thomas____> @pachet I used a selector to a label element and the event was 'mouseenter' and I tried using the off function both with a namespace specifier and just the plain .off() to remove everything
[06:27:58] <AdamPDotty> nights: not sure what you are trying to do but .prop('selected', true);
[06:27:59] <AdamPDotty> or such?
[06:28:16] <grosberg> hi
[06:28:40] <grosberg> I know its quite a lame question, but please help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/FG9Lg/19/
[06:30:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> ehmmm
[06:30:13] <AdamPDotty> you again
[06:30:45] <iSeeDeadPixels> $('#final tr').find('td:eq(1)') how do i thingy a function {
[06:30:48] <iSeeDeadPixels> ? *
[06:31:00] <NodeX> thingy ?
[06:31:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> yeah
[06:31:06] <iSeeDeadPixels> like
[06:31:16] <iSeeDeadPixels> .change(function() {});
[06:31:21] <hlve> hi shadester
[06:31:25] <iSeeDeadPixels> sorry, i'm dutch lol
[06:31:31] <NodeX> you want to trigger a function ?
[06:31:39] <NodeX> or bind a function to that selector?
[06:33:02] <iSeeDeadPixels> NodeX:
[06:33:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> .change(function() {});
[06:33:07] <iSeeDeadPixels> like that
[06:33:19] <iSeeDeadPixels> i wanna do something with the selected tdq'
[06:33:23] <iSeeDeadPixels> td's *
[06:33:30] <NodeX> what is "somethign"
[06:33:35] <NodeX> something *
[06:33:46] <iSeeDeadPixels> anything?
[06:33:52] <AdamPDotty> ah I am guessing, its .each() again
[06:33:55] <iSeeDeadPixels> set the inner text
[06:33:58] <NodeX> $('#final tr').find('td:eq(1)').click(function() {alert('Anything')});
[06:34:11] <iSeeDeadPixels> to &euro; 0.00
[06:34:25] <NodeX> or $('#final tr').find('td:eq(1)').text('&euro 0.00');
[06:34:28] <AdamPDotty> you want it without an event?
[06:35:12] <iSeeDeadPixels> an...event?
[06:36:06] <AdamPDotty> event = user interaction
[06:36:13] <AdamPDotty> sorry, my dutch is bad
[06:39:59] <iSeeDeadPixels> np, and nope
[06:40:01] <iSeeDeadPixels> $('#final tr').find('td:nth-child(2)').each(function() 	{ 		$(this).html("&euro; 0.00"); 	});
[06:40:19] <grosberg> how can I traverse trough a multi level json object? Can I use the each function?
[06:41:09] <NodeX> you didn't say all of them iSeeDeadPixels
[06:44:09] <usc911> Hey guys, have a site that has a punch of dynamic posts that I would like to add an accordion to. All the examples I have found on the net are very static and require creating a bunch of elements with static content. So at the moment my accordion is just selecting all the news posts I have because they have the same class. Does anyone have an examples of how I can select by the it or title of the post and its content? (apologies if thats a bit vague)
[06:47:30] <seutje> ?contains @ usc911
[06:47:31] <bot-t> usc911, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[06:47:40] <seutje> (beware, it can kill performance)
[06:48:34] <usc911> ok thanks, that looks like what i need, any alternatives if it does indeed kill performance?
[06:48:42] <keirlav87> grosberg, did you get any help with your question?
[06:49:09] <grosberg> keirlav87: no :(
[06:49:42] <usc911> I will give this a shot
[06:49:47] <usc911> thanks :)
[06:49:50] <keirlav87> i've made this amendment to your fiddle, it works but no idea how efficient / elegant it is, probably not great :p
[06:49:54] <keirlav87> http://jsfiddle.net/FG9Lg/47/
[06:51:58] <keirlav87> grosberg, is that what you were after?
[06:52:24] <juboba> AdamPDotty, no I want to get the parent's id since it is table. Weird thing happens. If I use a function instead of a url I can use $(this)
[06:55:45] <grosberg> to: keirlav87  thats it! I didn't understand the two variables in the function, but now I see: in the .each function the two variable is always the index and value?
[06:57:21] <AdamPDotty> juboba: I do not know what "this" is in there. If its the input elemment, it might get complicated
[06:57:36] <keirlav87> yeah the first parameter is always the key of the item, and the second is the value or whatever is held within the object at that key
[06:58:03] <juboba> AdamPDotty, no, it is a td. I want to get the tr's id instead of the td'd id
[06:58:18] <grosberg> keirlav87: and if the value is an object, then I can iterate trough it too with the each
[06:59:06] <juboba> AdamPDotty, look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9748127/jeditable-is-taking-only-one-id
[06:59:08] <AdamPDotty> and what does .parent() give you?
[06:59:10] <keirlav87> yeah thats right, i labelled it alittle misleading-ly really - in the case of the first "each" call the 'v' is the object containing your collection of id's / name's
[06:59:13] <juboba> AdamPDotty, nothing
[06:59:45] <juboba> AdamPDotty, according to the first answer to this guy $(this).attr() should work. It doesn't for me
[06:59:45] <keirlav87> i'm just in the habit of labeling $.each params as i,v
[07:02:44] <juboba> AdamPDotty, there, I fixed it. Using the .each() function
[07:02:47] <grosberg> keirlav87: and i the second .each what will be the "ind"?
[07:02:52] <juboba> thanks for your help AdamPDotty
[07:02:57] <AdamPDotty> hehe ok
[07:04:13] <ohcibi> where can i find documentations about the parameters which the callback functions from ajax().done(), fail() and always() take?
[07:05:30] <helly^> If I use .append to add fields to a form. How can I then remove them ?
[07:06:37] <AdamPDotty> .remove() ?
[07:06:40] <ohcibi> helly^: either cache them when creating or add an id, then search for that id and remove it
[07:07:03] <AdamPDotty> rather class than id, when theres more than one element
[07:07:24] <AdamPDotty> ok, depending on your goal
[07:07:56] <keirlav87> grosberg, because the first v is over an array and the elements are not associately indexed, each just gives them a numerical index, so ind will just hold the index number of the current iteration from 0-6 in the first calls case for example
[07:08:48] <keirlav87> you could actually change my fiddle to this - http://jsfiddle.net/FG9Lg/49/ - which i think would be alittle more efficient, because your not assigning unnecessary variables
[07:10:43] <helly^> Thanks, that sound like a goode idea ohcibi and AdamPDotty
[07:11:42] <ohcibi> AdamPDotty: when there are more than one element on that page and he wants to remove only one of it, class is no good choice anyway
[07:12:01] <keirlav87> can anyone suggest a good way of generating an id that represents a state of data that the client has from the server, so that when i'm polling I can just update the dom when I know that state has changed?
[07:12:07] <AdamPDotty> yep noticed that after my first line
[07:12:28] <grosberg> keirlav87:  do I think it right?:  In my example, there is an object (data) wich contains arrays (category1, category2...), and the arrays contains objects with properties (id, name)... its quite confusing :)
[07:12:28] <ohcibi> keirlav87: use data() for storing states on elements
[07:13:04] <JaredCE> how do i find an <li> element with a specific id within an if statement?
[07:13:12] <keirlav87> grosberg, yeah thats exactly right
[07:13:33] <Lakario> $('#id')
[07:13:48] <Lakario> or $('li#id') if you prefer
[07:15:05] <grosberg> keirlav87:  ...and when I iterate trough, with .each, the object containing arrays gives the arrays name, as index, and the arrays containing objects gives the objects index number as index
[07:17:11] <keirlav87> the first each you are iterating over the object called data, so i gives you the name of each key in the data object, the second each you are iterating over an array of objects, which are keyed, so you get the index number of that elements position in the array
[07:17:20] <keirlav87> i'm not very good at explaining things :P
[07:17:34] <keirlav87> which are not* keyed
[07:17:34] <superlukas> jQuery doesn't use requestAnimationFrame, right?
[07:17:51] <keirlav87> I'm not sure if there is an inbuilt recursive iterater function in jquery?
[07:18:51] <pachet> JaredCE, Lakario : $('li#id') is redundant
[07:19:21] <Lakario> yeah i know :)
[07:19:36] <Lakario> specificity isnt a bad thing though
[07:20:02] <pachet> the id IS specificity ;] but i see your point
[07:20:24] <keirlav87> ohcibi: what about if you want to store a state of information as a whole? what im trying to do is poll the server and have some way of saying, this is what my data looks like at the moment - when this changes update the dom
[07:21:13] <pachet> keirlav87: you could incorporate several fields from a dataset into a hash
[07:21:17] <ohcibi> keirlav87: this sounds like a typical model-view story to me... consider using something like backbone.js to store these data in a model an bind the render methods of your views to its change event
[07:23:08] <converge> is there a way to have two returns from an ajax call ?
[07:23:29] <keirlav87> ohcibi: I think you might be right about looking at a framework, i've tried to avoid it as the deadline im on for this project didn't really incorporate the learning curve for me though :(
[07:23:49] <pachet> converge: ajax calls return a jqXHR object, so they're not really used much for their return value normally
[07:23:53] <keirlav87> pachet: do you have any examples you could point me to that outline the method you describe?
[07:24:04] <pachet> converge: can you explain in more detail?
[07:24:51] <ohcibi> keirlav87: i understand that but it should be not to difficult. otherwise you could just store the data into a global object (which could be your "model") and then poll that thing for the changes.. its also possible to store a whole hash with .data()
[07:25:05] <converge> pachet: I have this ajax call that return the "total price" and "total quantity", but I dont know yet how to return it to the view (mvc)
[07:25:53] <keirlav87> converge have you console.log(data) in your success callback for your ajax call?
[07:26:29] <ohcibi> converge: an ajax call is not returning the data you are calling. it fires up a callback function that receives the returned data (aka the servers response) as an argument
[07:27:04] <grosberg> keirlav87:  I guess I understand it now (more or less), thank you!
[07:27:05] <keirlav87> ohcibi - I was thinking about pumping everything from the server into localStorage, would that be unwise?
[07:27:08] <ohcibi> converge: in this function you can set your models data (which is the way you do it in mvc. update the model. the model will then update the views (or the views will update if the models change, depends on implementation)
[07:27:19] <keirlav87> grosberg: apologies for my terrible explanations!
[07:27:34] <ohcibi> keirlav87: it has less browser-support
[07:27:44] <ohcibi> keirlav87: except that its kind of the same in the end
[07:28:18] <ohcibi> keirlav87: but as global objects or .data() should work with quite ancient browsers, localstorage should only be an option if you build a super modern app
[07:28:30] <JaredCE> ok... my code is a bit off.  I have a getJson bringing back some json data, for each "object" of json data i want to loop over and find the matching option in a select: i have this - $.map( data, function( item ) { $("#lstTribeIDs option").each(function (index, elem) { but thats wrong
[07:28:47] <pachet> ohcibi: sorry having to take phone calls, i second ohcibi's framework suggestion, his advice is sound!
[07:28:55] <JaredCE> it does work, but it loops over everything way too many times
[07:28:55] <phil-adept> hi all. Does anyone know how I can prevent a jQuery UI datepicker from closing once a date has been selected?...
[07:28:58] <pachet> er, * keirlav87^
[07:29:12] <converge> ohcibi, keirlav87: my ajax return is an php array with 'total price' and 'total quantity'
[07:29:27] <pachet> well, it's not a php array because we're not in php anymore dorothy
[07:29:40] <pachet> or toto, or whatever the quote is
[07:29:46] <ohcibi> pachet: 8-)
[07:30:01] <keirlav87> converge: json_encode your array before you return it to the client
[07:30:31] <keirlav87> return json_encode($returnarray); for example
[07:30:44] <converge> keirlav87: good, I'll try that
[07:31:50] <keirlav87> then pass a parameter (or argument? I always get these terms mixed up!) to the success callback of your ajax call, lets say you structure it success: function(data){ }
[07:32:27] <keirlav87> your prices will then accessible through the keys of the data object, data.total_price for example
[07:37:13] <JaredCE> or, why does: $.map( data, function( item ) { console.log($("#lstTribeIDs option").find(item.label).index()); } return -1?
[07:40:57] <john-dev> did anyone managed to use .autocomplete with categorys and a hidden id?
[07:42:51] <pachet> JaredCE: what is item.label?
[07:43:09] <JaredCE> it's from my json, it would be something like "Director"
[07:43:58] <JaredCE> of which I know there is an option that is <option value="10">Director</option>
[07:44:01] <JaredCE> pachet:
[07:45:26] <_archer_> JaredCD : $("#lstTribeIDs option").filter(function() { return $(this).val() == item.label; }).index()
[07:46:02] <_archer_> JaredCD - sorry - not val, text
[07:46:03] <_archer_> $("#lstTribeIDs option").filter(function() { return $(this).text() == item.label; }).index()
[07:46:40] <sukima> :set -g visual-bell on
[07:46:46] <sukima> Duh'!
[07:49:54] <JaredCE> thanks _archer_
[07:50:13] <_archer_> Np JaredCD :)
[07:50:28] <_archer_> Np JaredCE :) - lol, can't even get your name right :p
[07:50:36] <_archer_> It's been one of those days
[07:50:39] <JaredCE> hah
[07:53:38] <darkfrog> I have generated HTML that contains JavaScript within it that needs to come from the server.  Up to this point I've been sending it in JSON via AJAX, but I'm having issues with escaping characters properly as I have dynamic content wrapped in dynamic content.  I was hoping someone might have a suggestion of a cleaner way to do this?
[07:54:29] <darkfrog> both escaping characters and multi-line issues are coming up
[07:56:02] <darkfrog> I'm tempted to just start streaming it back as text and parsing block lengths
[07:56:56] <Hornet> http://i.imgur.com/eAlkZ.jpg
[07:57:02] <sukima> darkfrog: a jason escape function doesn't escape the content correct;y?
[07:57:20] <sukima> s/jason/json/
[07:57:22] <Hornet> depends on the jason you're escaping from and how fast you can run
[07:57:41] <darkfrog> sukima: most of the time yes, but when you have javascript within javascript the escaping gets confused. :o
[07:57:55] <sukima> What about jsonp?
[07:58:47] <silverwind> base64 could be another solution :/
[07:58:48] * darkfrog is looking at jsonp
[07:58:49] <sukima> js inside js souns shaddy to me. I avoid eval religiously
[07:59:14] <Hornet> it has uses
[07:59:21] <darkfrog> sukima: I would like to, but when you have content coming from the server is there really another choice?
[08:00:43] <darkfrog> silverwind: I don't think encoding should be necessary. :-p
[08:01:09] <sukima> darkfrog: What you talking about sounds very simular to what jsonp is for
[08:01:50] <darkfrog> I can simply do: [instruction,124,<html content here that is exactly 124 characters>]
[08:02:47] <darkfrog> sukima: at a quick glance I agree, but to any structured system like JSON there is parsing time and looking at JSON-P it would appear that there are some compatability issues
[08:05:00] <_archer_> darkfrog - can you not generate a .js file on the server and simply include it dynamically in the ajax success callback?
[08:05:13] <sukima> jsonp is simply a eval on returned content. hence js inside js. Or if your talking HTML you could use a template system like mustache and return plan HTML that you pass through the template engine. Or simply base64
[08:05:31] <iSeeDeadPixels> how can i call a function when a input is changed or keyup?
[08:06:16] <sukima> $(#my-input").bind("keyup", function(e) { .. do something .. });
[08:06:22] <iSeeDeadPixels> any input
[08:06:47] <iSeeDeadPixels> $('input').change(function() { something }); doesn;t work
[08:06:54] <bartmax> intelligent people, it's ok HTTPS be on GET actions or POST are also required? Im doing PRG.

[09:05:40] <bot-t> docmur, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[09:06:21] <Eviltwin> Why are you returning false from $(function() { ... })?
[09:06:34] <docmur> It just kills it when it hits the end
[09:06:39] <Eviltwin> Also, look closely at lines 13 and 14
[09:06:52] <Eviltwin> And how they're different from 5 and 6
[09:08:29] <JaredCE> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12693905/jquery-remove-items-not-in-a-list i've managed to get this far with your help , but need a little more.
[09:10:01] <Eviltwin> Your JavaScript has mismatched single quotes
[09:10:39] <bigfg> hello, i am going to build a small ajax notifications module for a php application and i was thinking about the best way to use jquery for this. Is there any place where you would recommend me to look at?
[09:11:07] <bigfg> (ie, for code samples etc)
[09:11:08] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ bigfg
[09:11:09] <bot-t> bigfg, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:11:21] <bigfg> wait, i know js, i just want to make good use of jquery
[09:11:29] <Eviltwin> Then see link
[09:11:29] <Eviltwin> 2
[09:11:51] <bigfg> ok...
[09:14:39] <grosberg> bye
[09:15:29] <bigfg> ok, this page doesn't hold any information i don't know for what i could see (checked the ajax related topic). I'm talking about properly structuring jquery code
[09:15:51] <Eviltwin> Well that's pretty damn vague
[09:16:07] <bigfg> that's why i asked if there was a place with particularly interesting jquery code
[09:16:20] <NodeX> jquery.org :)
[09:16:37] <bigfg> let's see...
[09:17:08] <timing_> bigfg: look a bit at $.ajax and $.get and $.post
[09:17:23] <timing_> common guys, we are not in #cakephp, we are in #jquery, which are helpful guys
[09:18:29] <bigfg> timing, i've managed to use those methods before... i think this is not the kind of question one can answer :p
[09:18:39] <bigfg> i'll have to program and see what happens
[09:20:12] <NodeX> what;s the problem bigfg ?
[09:20:57] <Eviltwin> He wants to know how to structure jQuery for a larger application
[09:21:01] <bigfg> NodeX, just a bit clueless in how to structure generic jquery code (generic as in, i want to build a notification manager that synchronizes with a php server)
[09:21:15] <Eviltwin> Which there is no one right answer to
[09:21:35] <timing> $(document).ready(function(){ /* your notification manager here */ });
[09:21:37] <NodeX> you need a concept first then we can help construct it
[09:22:01] <Eviltwin> Writing code right involves writing it (probably wrong) first
[09:22:21] <bigfg> yeah, that's what i meant before by just programming it :p
[09:22:25] * NodeX steals that for a blog title
[09:22:36] <timing> bigfg: is your server going to return the html for in the notification area?
[09:22:43] <timing> or is it going to return json?
[09:22:46] <bigfg> well, this is the main point, now that you mention it
[09:23:09] <bigfg> the ajax api is set for json return, which is pretty convenient as far as ajax comes
[09:23:22] <timing> if it returns html, you can use this: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[09:23:59] <timing> bigfg: look at $.getJSON then
[09:24:16] <bigfg> i have no problem in receiving or sending the data.. the problem is which data is being sent
[09:24:20] <bigfg> (that is not decided)
[09:24:39] <bigfg> suppose i have a php key-value dictionary with notification types and notification messages
[09:24:46] <Eviltwin> HTML's probably going to be more bytes
[09:24:51] <NodeX> my advice is to send it in html (a bit more bloat but allows greater control for schema changes)
[09:25:00] <Eviltwin> But if you send JSON your client will have to be able to render each type of notification
[09:25:03] <NodeX> then simply use load() to load the html to the element
[09:25:18] <Eviltwin> The problem with sending HTML is consistency
[09:25:20] <bigfg> i want to display some of those (there might be some of them when the page starts), and put ajax style 'dismiss' toggles...
[09:25:29] <Eviltwin> If you change the CSS classes its using or something
[09:25:33] <NodeX> plus JSON needs to be parsed by the client
[09:25:40] <Eviltwin> Any running page will start having references to CSS classes that don't exist
[09:26:04] <bigfg> right now the system in place prints the html directly from php, so there is no ajax possible
[09:26:20] <NodeX> you can add ajax to that quickly
[09:26:21] <bigfg> the notifications are static and the dismissal links will reload the page (unacceptable behavior)
[09:26:28] <Eviltwin> If only AJAX could fetch HTML
[09:26:32] <NodeX> LOL
[09:26:39] <devmikey> Is there an easier way in jquery to do "Method 2" described here: http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/dynamiccontent4.shtml
[09:26:44] <NodeX> you could "Web 2.0" that in about an hour!
[09:27:07] <bigfg> lol sure, but i want the ability to also launch notifications from the client side
[09:27:23] <NodeX> $.get("/path/to/api",function(data) { $("selector").html(data);});
[09:27:40] <Eviltwin> devmikey: ...just use .innerHTML
[09:27:57] <NodeX> define launch notifications?
[09:28:40] <devmikey> Eviltwin: Well, the thing is, when I set an attribute to be the same thing, in firefox it doesnt update even if the cache is turned off
[09:28:58] <NodeX> are you saying you want to add something from say one user to then appear on another users screen
[09:29:11] <Eviltwin> devmikey: Pretty sure you're doing something else wrong then
[09:29:17] <bigfg> for example, you have a button that talks jquery to a server... and that server is unavailable
[09:29:30] <pachet> talk jquery to me
[09:29:30] <bigfg> talks ajax through jquery*
[09:29:36] <Eviltwin> "that talks jquery to a server"
[09:29:38] <devmikey> not really.  it's strictly a FF issue.  works fine in Safari and Opera
[09:29:39] <k1ng> hi
[09:29:45] <k1ng> how do i do something like this? $('tr#4013').find('td')[4].html('blah');
[09:29:53] <k1ng> without [4] it does work
[09:29:55] <Eviltwin> ?see eq @ k1ng
[09:29:59] <bot-t> k1ng, .eq() - Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[09:30:03] <k1ng> thanks
[09:30:11] <NodeX> k1ng : ID's are illegal to start with numbers
[09:30:21] <NodeX> just FYI
[09:30:26] <pachet> Eviltwin: $('#what :is(up)')
[09:30:41] <NodeX> teh RFC stated it so dont expect every browser to support it
[09:30:46] <NodeX> states*
[09:31:19] <xec> actually, with html5, IDs starting with a number is fine
[09:31:35] <bigfg> so suppose you use $.ajax(error: function () { < talk to your application server and let it know that you had a problem, then print something in the notifications manager> })
[09:33:35] <NodeX> is there a question coming bigfg ?
[09:34:01] <bigfg> no, imagine that's what you want to do
[09:38:48] <bigfg> now, that function () { ... } is not necessarily to be executed in an error condition from an ajax... imagine you have div #notificationmanager -> [div .notifstyle notif="..."] -> button(dismiss) and you can hook for example (".notif").children("button").onclick( ... ) and use the notif = "..." to talk to the server
[09:41:07] <bigfg> at the start of the page life i could append all current notifications coming from the server, then modify them as needed through ajax calls
[09:42:14] <devmikey> can you manipulate nodelists with jquery?
[09:44:48] <pachet> devmikey: its sort of a one-way street
[09:45:01] <pachet> devmikey: you can definitely pass nodeLists to jquery methods
[09:45:32] <pachet> but whenever jquery returns a collection of elements, that array is static
[09:50:58] <goldstar> anyone here using jquery mobile ?
[09:51:15] <ryanneufeld> goldstar: I am
[09:51:25] <ryanneufeld> ?ask
[09:51:26] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:52:16] <devmikey> if you remove a node from a node list and want to put it back later, how do you specify what position?
[09:52:19] <goldstar> ryanneufeld: i have a input field with a value="next" - When I try to set the icon via the buttonMarkup() method, the text for the input value disappears
[09:52:26] <devmikey> or can you not do that with jQuery?
[09:52:55] <pachet> devmikey: well, let's be clear
[09:53:06] <ryanneufeld> devmikey: you can, I would find out what was before it see ?previous
[09:53:07] <pachet> you're talking about a jquery collection, right?
[09:53:10] <bot-t> devmikey, .prev() - Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[09:53:11] <pachet> not a native nodeList?
[09:53:42] <ryanneufeld> goldstar: hm, you can set the value again after calling the buttonMarkup()
[09:53:58] <goldstar> ryanneufeld: how ?
[09:54:08] <ryanneufeld> goldstar: see ?val
[09:54:11] <bot-t> goldstar, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[09:54:42] <goldstar> doh, silly me. This is really annoying though, do you want this happens ?
[09:54:42] <devmikey> i think I am talking about a native nodelist
[09:55:06] <devmikey> which given your previous comments, it would seem i cant do what I want
[09:56:26] <ryanneufeld> goldstar: wat?
[09:57:53] <pachet> i mean, you could always do something like, var set = document.getElementsByTagName('span'), single = $(set).eq(2).detach(); single [0].parent.insertBefore(single [0], set [2])
[09:58:02] <pachet> but that'd be kind of defeating the point of using jquery in the first place :[
[09:58:06] <pachet> ^devmikey
[10:00:26] <noregret> isn't it possible to use selectors in the data field in ajaxForm ?
[10:03:04] <sukima> noregret: elaborate please.
[10:05:58] <noregret> sukima: https://pastee.org/3j6mp $(':checked') is not selected...
[10:09:57] <sukima> noregret: won't work like that
[10:10:42] <sukima> noregret: $(":checked") returns an array which has no method val(). try $(":checked").first().val() or use an enumeration fuction to build the word list.
[10:12:56] <noregret> sukima: yeah, i got aware of that so im' using .serialize() but it's still not selecting
[10:13:46] <zcreative> What was the question?
[10:14:06] <Che-Anarc> If I have a div class="clonable" which contains a <input type="number" id="order1" value="1">... how can I increment that on .clone() ?
[10:14:30] <Che-Anarc> I want to increment value of the input.
[10:14:52] <noregret> zcreative: https://pastee.org/gth7c selector isn't selecting..
[10:16:07] <zcreative> maybe try $('#tabs-2').find(':checked');
[10:16:26] <zcreative> and i think serialize only works on a form element.
[10:17:03] <pachet> $.fn.cloneAndIncr = function ( ) { var elem = $(this); return elem.clone().val(+ elem.val() ++); }
[10:17:04] <zcreative> nvm. i see that it works how you have it too.
[10:17:06] <pachet> Che-Anarc^
[10:18:54] <noregret> zcreative: i tried that same selector in the console, it gave teh right results
[10:19:05] <noregret> it just won't select in ajaxForm..
[10:19:26] <zcreative> Hrm is the form inserted after page load?
[10:19:53] <pachet> Che-Anarc: oh woops, spacecasing, just do s/++/+ 1/
[10:20:35] <sukima> noregret: regret can you try it in the console. Could be odd markup.
[10:22:42] <sukima> noregret: If it were me I'd pull out the logic from the data: asignment. Make a new function to return the correct data based on :checked. Easier to debug
[10:24:56] <docmur> with auto complete, when I echo back from php to jquery does the "information" get stored in the ui value of the select: function(e, ui) ?
[10:25:04] <docmur> I can't seem to figure out how to display the data coming back
[10:25:09] <Che-Anarc> pachet  ATM I'm doing > var newElem = $('#imgITEM' + num).clone().attr('id', 'imgITEM' + newNum);   my input id="imgORDER1" is therein.
[10:26:04] <noregret> sukima: already tried it in the console, it's working just fine
[10:26:41] <noregret> sukima: well, i want to get the logic in the submit event :)
[10:29:22] <sukima> I think the :checked is ran at the time ajaxForm is defined and not when you submit.
[10:29:48] <noregret> hmm, that could be right
[10:29:56] <sukima> There for if it's a fresh reload it will only find the checked inputs that are hard coded as checked and have been defined at the time the ajaxForm is defined.
[10:31:12] <noregret> so i should bind to the submit then ajaxSubmit frmo there ?
[10:31:18] <noregret> submit button *
[10:32:04] <sukima> According to [the documentation](http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/) I believe so.
[10:46:20] <atomiku> Can I use datepicker() as a full year AVAILABILITY calendar from Jan to Dec?
[10:53:52] <Arthur_AXQ> can somebody help me
[10:54:01] <zcreative> probably.
[10:54:19] <Arthur_AXQ> zcreative: http://root.co.il/
[10:54:22] <Arthur_AXQ> do you see the text slider
[10:54:35] <zcreative> yes.
[10:54:52] <Arthur_AXQ> zcreative: how can i make one that looks exacly like this
[10:56:32] <Arthur_AXQ> zcreative: do you know how to ?
[10:57:11] <zcreative> copy and paste all the code that makes their slider
[10:57:21] <Arthur_AXQ> zcreative: i tried..
[11:02:00] <docmur> I have an input box called search, I'm trying to use autocomplete to load it with values from a database, I have the database returning the data in JSON format and I have the autocompleter loading varibles with the data, What I can't figure out is how to get the data to show up under the box.  http://jsfiddle.net/d8zQw/ Is there a standard way to get the data to show up?
[11:03:22] <Arthur_AXQ> zcreative_ can you help me do that
[11:03:23] <Eviltwin> It'd probably be helpful to throw in some HTML and the relevant includes
[11:03:32] <Eviltwin> docmur: ^
[11:04:40] <Arthur_AXQ> Eviltwin: could you
[11:05:25] <Eviltwin> Arthur_AXQ: What is it you're trying to do?
[11:06:02] <docmur> fair enough,  http://jsfiddle.net/d8zQw/1/,  I can't post the PHP but the information is coming back in valid JSON formation, I've already verified that.  It's the search box I'm trying to populate
[11:06:06] <Arthur_AXQ> Eviltwin: im trying to copy the slidershow from here .. http://www.root.co.il/gameservers.php
[11:06:33] <bubu> when doing a form submission, has anyone noticed multiple POSTs taking place when there should only be one?
[11:07:17] <Trixer> been using jquery for 2 years and just now wondered into the irc channel for it hehe
[11:07:50] <Whirl3d__> Trixer, welcome, we've been wondering where you have been?
[11:08:15] <TelFiRE> yay jquery
[11:09:51] <Trixer> I love jquery :D
[11:10:28] <Trixer> So guys, I am not here for a "How do I do this" question instead I want to disuccess an implimentation that every part of me is saying no do not fucking do it like this
[11:10:33] <Trixer> but im stumped on better ways
[11:11:26] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez: where did this go https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/docs/jquery.json.md
[11:11:41] <ben_alman> that's the think that was linked in the grunt docs
[11:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/docs/manifest.md
[11:11:53] <ben_alman> thx
[11:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> sorry
[11:12:00] <Trixer> So im writing a browser game using pusher (if you havent used pusher its freaking awesome) anyway in my game things happen at specific times, now all of this is tracked by the server with time stamps.. so currently I have a timer that goes off and posts a hidden form to a page that does the various things and sends back pusher messages to people connected to the game
[11:12:09] <ben_alman> let me know if you move it again
[11:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I don't think it'll move again though.
[11:12:27] <Trixer> I am not worried about cheating cause the server insures its not an early post.. but I am worried about clients missing out on specific things cause of lag
[11:12:37] <ben_alman> well, hopefully it'll be a page on the actual site
[11:12:41] <ben_alman> someday
[11:12:46] <Trixer> or virus or just fiddling
[11:13:29] <Trixer> Ive thought about a self cycling cron job (basically it runs every minute and keeps self alive for like 59 secounds) but... I think that could get bad fast too.... anyone with this specific problem ever solved it any other way?
[11:15:11] <docmur> Fixed what ever the issue was
[11:15:12] <Trixer> and again just a quick shoutout for pusher (http://pusher.com/docs/javascript_quick_start) it really is some awesome shit! I understand how they do it, and not really unique.. but they packaged it all up very sexy and gave it to us in some really awesome mannors :D
[11:16:17] <Whirl3d__> Trixer, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but this is a family channel and folks would prefer that you didn't cuss. You know for the children. LOL
[11:16:28] <Trixer> oh my apologies
[11:16:38] <Trixer> I promote the learning JS for kids, so I will be clean
[11:16:43] <Trixer> :D
[11:16:53] <Whirl3d__> No problems. I'm checking out pusher right now.
[11:17:06] <Trixer> If you need help with it or whatever let me know :D
[11:17:08] <sporkf> I'm looking for a selector to select <pre>foo<pre>
[11:17:25] <Trixer> basically it allows your server to send messages to js via a channels sytem :D
[11:18:01] <Trixer> $('pre')[0].html()
[11:18:32] <Trixer> $("#divid").contents().find('pre').text() I think also works..
[11:18:55] <Arthur_AXQ> Eviltwin: ?
[11:19:03] <Eviltwin> Trixer: Well clearly your jQuery can use some work :P
[11:19:34] <Eviltwin> Arthur_AXQ: Sorry, I was unable to load that site for whatever reason
[11:19:46] <Eviltwin> Might be something to do with my work's firewall
[11:23:51] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez: are you guys straight up MIT expat now?
[11:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: yup
[11:24:39] <ben_alman> ok, cool.
[11:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> After I told you to change the init task because I didn't think it was worth you tryin to fight this battle, I realized that jQuery was big enough to fight the battle of educating the community.
[11:25:20] <ben_alman> yeah
[11:25:24] <ben_alman> i'm changing it to MIT now
[11:26:00] <scott_gonzalez> So I brought it up with the team and then we pinged the big GPL projects that use jQuery and contacted the FSF to get some support from them.
[11:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> So far I haven't heard any uproar, so that's good.
[11:28:42] <Trixer> EvilTwin: Lol most likely I have been jquering in a vacuum.. plus im an engineer im not techincally a coder :| But im doing a hobby project
[11:29:42] <Arthur_AXQ> Eviltwin: this is the code , http://pastebin.com/embed_iframe.php?i=SxEXsijg except for the buttons that doesnt work .. how can i copy only the slidershow

[11:48:00] <Che-Anarc> Hi can anybody help me out with: http://jsfiddle.net/fhVsh/2/  I am trying to create muultipart upload form... need to add fields dynamically but my $('.clonableInput').length is not increasing.
[11:48:43] <hlve> Hopefully someone can help me with this. ;P. After I finished coding my site, I decided to add pagination to the news pages, but after I finished implementing the pagination, I realized that I manually added the divs in place, so everytime a news item is added, I have to go back and drop everything down.
[11:48:44] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/Rxk4S/
[11:49:20] <hlve> Basically, I want the jquery to automatically seperate the news items, wrap every 5 in a <div id="Pane1" class="PagePane">   </div>
[11:49:20] <hlve> etc
[11:49:56] <hlve> let me know if I'm being confusing. ;)
[11:52:11] <j_ayen_green> I'm using jQuery 1.7.2, but when I replace bind/unbind with on/off for click events, the code doesn't fire

[11:56:10] <Manxa> fusion271: it does not
[11:56:26] <hlve> BillCriswell, awesome. exactly what i was looking for.
[11:56:27] <hlve> thanks!

[12:00:27] <bil`> Question - I have some jQuery in a controller to control a navigation menu through some DOM manipulation (I've read this is bad). I've also read i should refactor this into a directive, but I'm never going to reuse this code. Where's the best place for this jquery
[12:00:52] <vacho> ajpiano: :)
[12:00:55] <bil`> er wrong channel
[12:01:18] <Manxa> fusion271: nope :|
[12:01:37] <fusion271> Manxa: what's it saying the console?
[12:02:56] <Manxa> fusion271: http://pastie.org/4898362   line 35 being the line w/ the lart
[12:03:32] <fusion271> Manxa: is jquery loading?
[12:03:50] <Manxa> fusion271: yes.  i have some other methods which make jquery calls no problem
[12:04:17] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez: i'm tweaking the init template https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init-jquery-sample/tree/generated see the updated README (simpler) and CONTRIBUTING (lots in there) tell me if you have any feedback
[12:04:41] <Manxa> fusion271: if i can get $('[id^="attribute"]') working, that would make me soooo happy
[12:05:07] <fusion271> why can't you select by class?
[12:06:06] * Manxa shrugs.
[12:06:31] <Manxa> if i knew, i wouldn't be here 8D
[12:06:41] <hlve> BillCriswell, I'm kinda stuck, got a sec?
[12:07:07] <BillCriswell> I should be able to help a bit!
[12:07:14] <hlve> kk.
[12:07:19] <hlve> coffee break. Brb!
[12:07:28] <BillCriswell> Ok...
[12:07:45] <hlve> oh wait, i thought you said you should be able to help in a bit
[12:07:45] <hlve> lol
[12:08:19] <Manxa> fusion271: oh...damnit
[12:08:27] <BillCriswell> hlve: Haha, it's ok.
[12:08:42] <Manxa> fusion271: i can't very well do this on window 'load' because nothing's fsckin' loaded yet
[12:08:50] <hlve> One sec. just trying to clean up my code a bit.
[12:09:11] <fusion271> so you got  <select name="super_attribute[159]" id="attribute159" class="required-entry super-attribute-select">
[12:09:31] <fusion271> you can select it as $('.required-entry')
[12:09:46] <fusion271> or $('.super-attribute-select')
[12:11:12] <fusion271> Manxa: is <select name="super_attribute[159]" id="attribute159" class="required-entry super-attribute-select"> already on the page for docuemnt.ready ?
[12:11:33] <Manxa> fusion271: i'm using Event.observe(window, 'load', function(){}
[12:11:55] <fusion271> I've never seen that before
[12:12:08] <fusion271> how about that jquery alternative
[12:12:09] <fusion271> ?
[12:12:10] <Eviltwin> This is #jquery, not #prototype
[12:12:28] <fusion271> oh is that prototype?
[12:12:33] <Eviltwin> Yes
[12:12:46] <fusion271> there you go Manxa
[12:12:58] <fusion271> replace that Event.observe with $(document).ready(function()
[12:12:58] <fusion271> {
[12:12:58] <fusion271> alert("jQuery");
[12:12:58] <fusion271> });
[12:13:03] <Manxa> yea, just a min.  i think you helped anyhow :)
[12:13:52] <hlve> Hmph
[12:14:10] <hlve> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/Rxk4S/1/
[12:14:18] <hlve> I'm doing this wrong. for sure.
[12:14:48] <Eviltwin> I see a whole lot of nothing happening
[12:15:00] <hlve> I took out the manual panes for the pagination.
[12:15:25] <BillCriswell> hlve: The posts aren't in their own divs?
[12:15:26] <hlve> I know I could probably easily do this if I wrap each news item in a div, but I'm trying to avoid having to go back and do that on each of the 4 pages of news articles.
[12:16:00] <hlve> is that going to be the only way I can move forward?
[12:20:10] <guy> anyone can suggest an alternative to isotope?
[12:20:14] <guy> the latter is buggy.
[12:21:24] <BillCriswell> hlve: It would be a lot more work hlve.
[12:21:42] <Whirl3d__> hive, what are you trying to accomplish?
[12:22:22] <fris> guy what about quicksand?
[12:22:53] <hlve> automatic paging. wrapping every 5 items with a  <div id="Pane#" class="PagePane">
[12:22:55] <guy> It is not for masonry layout.
[12:23:15] <hlve> BillCriswell, I'll wrap em all in divs. Not too big of a change.
[12:25:11] <Whirl3d__> That would sure make for a nice plugin! Select all elements between a specific element and that same class of elements. So between h2 for example.
[12:26:40] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/Rxk4S/2/
[12:26:57] <grey> so this might be a bit of a scary thought but... can I use jquery and jquery-ui in a google hangout extension app? or would that just be insanely heavy?
[12:27:26] <hlve> So... progress. It's wrapping the first 5 in a div.test.
[12:27:29] <hlve> Progress! :)
[12:27:30] <sjeijk> can some1 tell how I can make a button that launches a popup input form and send the value to a script via ajax...
[12:28:15] <sjeijk> I can get the button to work, the popup form also, but somehow i don't understand when the value I put into the input field to send it to the script
[12:28:42] <BillCriswell> hlve: Even with it wrapped in divs it's getting a little weird, see the issue I think though.
[12:28:44] <Che-Anarc> How comes my $('.clonableInput').length; does not increase when I add a .clone to it: http://jsfiddle.net/fhVsh/2/
[12:29:28] <hlve> BillCriswell, it wraps the first five, but doesn't loop to all the other .NewsItem divs
[12:29:46] <hlve> would I need to write a loop for it to do that?
[12:30:34] <sjeijk> i have a simple setup in http://jsfiddle.net/mwVx6/12/ but it has some problems with the form
[12:30:34] <callumacrae> http://i.imgur.com/eAlkZ.jpg
[12:30:36] <callumacrae> lol
[12:30:42] <callumacrae> check out code in bottom left
[12:31:15] <BillCriswell> Damn, jQuery moving on up!
[12:31:30] <Whirl3d__> how do you select children 3 - 5 using a selector rather than looping?
[12:32:00] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d__: I chained :gt() and :lt()
[12:32:40] <BillCriswell> it didn't work that well though.. expected div:gt(0):lt(5) to return the first five but it returns 2 - 6. If I just do div:lt(5) it returns 1-5.
[12:32:41] <Eviltwin> I would suggest using .slice
[12:32:59] <Eviltwin> Since slice can do that in one call and is faster than the pseudo selector
[12:33:00] <BillCriswell> Eviltwin: Definitely, what I was just hacking up.
[12:33:01] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/Rxk4S/3/
[12:33:03] <hlve> u_o?
[12:34:52] <TelFiRE> Ok, I love jQuery and all, but am I the only one who thinks it's utterly stupid to be using it for a weapons guidance system? I pray to god that thing was photoshopped...
[12:35:14] <ajpiano> lol TelFiRE it's obviously shopped
[12:35:25] <ajpiano> if you look at the code it's clearly like, mediocre form validation code
[12:36:08] <TelFiRE> figured but the thought made me facepalm because it's totally something the US government might do
[12:37:35] <Manxa> leave
[12:41:19] <fusion271> You guys ever brought encoded HTML down from a JSON ajax return?
[12:41:21] <fusion271> https://gist.github.com/3796102#file_obj_jsonv_mlist.js
[12:41:26] <fusion271> #50 there
[12:41:36] <fusion271> that rat bastard is killing me
[12:41:58] <Whirl3d__> hive, what about something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Rxk4S/11/
[12:42:17] <Whirl3d__> not working, mind you, but it could work with some more effort...lol
[12:43:00] <callumacrae> ajpiano: It's from a film, of course!
[12:43:14] <ajpiano> i know!
[12:43:46] <hlve> really appreciate the help, btw. thanks again everyone
[12:44:10] <hlve> now to figure out where that code is breaking.
[12:44:11] <hlve> ;o
[12:45:21] <BillCriswell> This code is driving me crazy haha.
[12:47:09] <BillCriswell> Why is this only working on the first 5? http://jsfiddle.net/5jVPw/4/
[12:48:28] <BillCriswell> DUH
[12:48:30] <BillCriswell> Nevermind.
[12:48:32] <BillCriswell> <-- Idiot.
[12:48:56] <appel> what are you trying to do?
[12:49:30] <BillCriswell> hlve: http://jsfiddle.net/5jVPw/5/
[12:49:38] <BillCriswell> appel: That. lol.
[12:49:40] <guy> anyone want to guess why isotope sometimes work and why sometimes it doesn't? https://dev.anuary.com/451b5b98-4ebb-552d-867d-5dd685cd1810/
[12:49:57] <appel> why don't you use css selectors?
[12:50:09] <Eviltwin> appel: They're slower
[12:50:23] <BillCriswell> appel: I also can't do div:gt(0):lt(5) sadly.
[12:50:29] <TelFiRE> colorbox sure uses a lot of markup... be nice if there was a "colorbox light" or whatever that just put your stuff in a single div with a close button lol
[12:51:04] <BillCriswell> The second parameter of slice made me feel so dumb just now lol.
[12:52:01] <Eviltwin> You could do .slice(i).slice(0, 5) but it'd be slower
[12:52:36] <BillCriswell> Eviltwin: True.
[12:53:04] <BillCriswell> Why do I only notice errors after I show everyone what I was trying to do?
[12:53:18] <Eviltwin> Because you don't spend enough time looking at the code before sending it to us?
[12:53:27] <Eviltwin> That's usually the issue :P
[12:53:49] <fusion271> I hate getting better with jQuery because my problems are able to be fielded by less and less people
[12:54:00] <fusion271> bite in the arse
[12:54:18] <Eviltwin> #firstworldproblems
[12:54:37] <jle2002> hello
[12:54:43] <BillCriswell> Eviltwin: I was looking at that for a while sadly. =(
[12:54:58] <jle2002> i am trying to load a dropdownlist dynamically when the user clicks on the dropdownlist
[12:54:58] <BillCriswell> Well... 5-10 minutes tops.
[12:54:58] <Eviltwin> Well, RTFM in the future :P
[12:55:02] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[12:55:06] <jle2002> but when i add it to the focus
[12:55:09] <jle2002> or click event
[12:55:17] <jle2002> the first time i click on the dropdownlist it doesnt populate
[12:55:25] <jle2002> i have to click on it twice for it to populate
[12:55:30] <jle2002> from jquery post
[12:55:36] <jle2002> how do i make it work on the first click
[12:55:57] <arielserafini> ?demo @ jle2002
[12:55:57] <bot-t> jle2002, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:55:59] <fusion271> jle2002: let's see your code
[12:56:04] <fusion271> stick it in a gist or pastie
[12:56:12] <arielserafini> no, make a jsfiddle
[12:56:12] <fusion271> yeah or fiddle
[12:56:14] <Eviltwin> Or a jsFiddle, most preferably
[12:56:21] <Tezcatlipoka> Hello! I am having a problem with a jquery loading indicator I'm making. Anybody feel like taking a look to help out a poor, disheartened soul?
[12:56:22] <arielserafini> fusion271, dont encourage bad behavior! :P
[12:56:40] <fusion271> sorry sorry
[12:56:41] <Tezcatlipoka> http://jsfiddle.net/SNdM2/1/
[12:57:18] <Whirl3d__> how is the array method push different from the jquery .add method? Aren't there times they could be interchanged?
[12:57:25] <arielserafini> Tezcatlipoka, I'll take a look
[12:57:38] <Eviltwin> Tezcatlipoka: Left hand side
[12:57:43] <Eviltwin> Under "Choose Framework"
[12:57:44] <jle2002> well
[12:57:47] <Eviltwin> There is a problem
[12:57:48] <jle2002> i cant make a living demo
[12:57:51] <jle2002> cause of this
[12:58:00] <jle2002> i dont have an outside webserver
[12:58:05] <jle2002> and this uses $post
[12:58:07] <jle2002> to get the results
[12:58:19] <Eviltwin> jle2002: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[12:58:24] <fusion271> jle2002:  you're posting internally?
[12:58:53] <Tezcatlipoka> arielserafini, thanks :)
[12:59:10] <jle2002> well i am running off of local
[12:59:20] <fusion271> yea, that'd be tough to fiddle there
[12:59:21] <arielserafini> Tezcatlipoka, did you see what Eviltwin said?
[12:59:26] <BillCriswell> jle2002: Just load the drop down before you click the dropdown.
[12:59:32] <jle2002> i cant
[12:59:40] <jle2002> its suppose to look at the rest of the form
[12:59:48] <Tezcatlipoka> arielserafini, Eviltwin, what under choose framework? I have jQuery selected
[12:59:58] <BillCriswell> jle2002: Do it when the page loads then.
[12:59:58] <Tezcatlipoka> on load
[12:59:58] <jle2002> then using what people entered populate the dropdownlist
[13:00:02] <Eviltwin> Tezcatlipoka: Not in the link you sent us
[13:00:03] <jle2002> no
[13:00:06] <jle2002> cant
[13:00:12] <jle2002> they have to fill it out
[13:00:12] <fusion271> jle2002: stick it in a pastie or gist
[13:00:21] <BillCriswell> They have to fill out a whole field first?
[13:00:35] <jle2002> they have to fill out addresses
[13:00:43] <ScottG> If I do $('foo').find('select, input') is that equvalent to 'foo select, foo input' or 'foo select, input' ?
[13:00:46] <jle2002> then from those i get the services we provide
[13:00:49] <jle2002> listen man
[13:00:57] <Tezcatlipoka> http://jsfiddle.net/SNdM2/2/ there we go
[13:01:01] <Eviltwin> ScottG: Former
[13:01:02] <BillCriswell> ScottG: foo select, foo input.
[13:01:18] <ScottG> Ok good. Thanks
[13:01:21] <arielserafini> ScottG, but using .find is probably faster
[13:01:33] <BillCriswell> jle2002: When the address field loses focus populate the drop down list then.
[13:01:33] <ScottG> arielserafini: ?
[13:01:52] <jle2002> omg
[13:01:58] <jle2002> there are more than one address field
[13:02:06] <arielserafini> ScottG, because you're limiting the scope of your search to just 'foo'
[13:02:07] <jle2002> its like city
[13:02:08] <jle2002> state
[13:02:11] <jle2002> country
[13:02:13] <jle2002> zip
[13:02:13] <arielserafini> instead of the entire DOM
[13:02:15] <jle2002> to and from
[13:02:18] <BillCriswell> Then wait till they're all populated before you populate the dropdown.
[13:02:22] <jle2002> address line 1
[13:02:24] <ScottG> arielserafini: Right, that's what I want.
[13:02:37] <fusion271> jle2002: I gotta bounce, I worked my arse off today, so I gotta go arse hunting
[13:02:53] <jle2002> billcriswell
[13:02:56] <BillCriswell> arse hunting... Not familiar with that. Sounds like fun.
[13:03:03] <jle2002> i cant populate it when they click on the dropdownlist?
[13:03:13] <jle2002> is that possible?
[13:03:14] <fusion271> it's off and I need it back
[13:03:14] <Tezcatlipoka> arielserafini, Eviltwin, Care to take a look now that it's semi-working? http://jsfiddle.net/SNdM2/2/
[13:03:25] <fusion271> yes you can jle2002
[13:03:27] <Whirl3d__> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5jVPw/11/
[13:03:40] <jle2002> fusion271 how?
[13:03:48] <fusion271> http://api.jquery.com/mousedown/
[13:03:50] <jle2002> i do on cluick and it works the second click
[13:03:52] <jle2002> not the first
[13:03:57] <jle2002> aon on focus too
[13:04:07] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d__: http://jsfiddle.net/5jVPw/5/ is what I came up with.
[13:04:31] <Whirl3d__> yours is so much nicer. LOL
[13:04:42] <Whirl3d__> Now if you can just get the elements in to divs
[13:04:57] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d__: That seems like way too much work lol
[13:05:14] <BillCriswell> Wrapping it up in a div would cut so much time off that task haha.
[13:05:36] <jle2002> that didnt work fusion
[13:05:44] <jle2002> that worked the same as focus
[13:05:54] <jle2002> it populated it on the second click
[13:06:31] <bfig> if i do <htmlelem attrib="false"> how can i use that attrib as a boolean?
[13:07:27] <jle2002> http://pastebin.com/rzj1PX3W
[13:09:03] <syborg> bfig: I might suggest using data-attrib="false"
[13:09:03] <Che-Anarc> I have an issue... http://jsfiddle.net/fhVsh/3/ I dont understand why .val(Number) is not taking effect beyond 2.
[13:09:11] <syborg> then you can use: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[13:09:25] <bfig> ok, i'm checking
[13:11:14] <BillCriswell> jle2002: I just don't think you'll be able to populate it on click because of the way browsers handle select elements.
[13:13:40] <syborg> bfig: Like this http://jsfiddle.net/nqtN9/
[13:14:21] <BillCriswell> I really think you should be doing it after a form has been validated, if you're insistent on this and it's in a controlled environment you can do: http://jsfiddle.net/qN483/1/
[13:14:53] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/qN483/2/ this I mean.
[13:16:01] <jle2002> whats different aobout it?
[13:16:22] <BillCriswell> It repopulates the select element.
[13:16:29] <jle2002> whats different about on and focus?
[13:16:38] <guy> what is the difference between onload="function(){}" and $(function(){}); ?
[13:16:42] <jle2002> well can i do that on focus event?
[13:17:09] <BillCriswell> jle2002: Focus can work. You were trying a click earlier.
[13:17:16] <BillCriswell> jle2002: http://jsfiddle.net/qN483/3/
[13:17:32] <jle2002> well
[13:17:34] <jle2002> the thing is
[13:17:37] <jle2002> focus works
[13:17:38] <jle2002> but
[13:17:45] <jle2002> when i combine that with $post
[13:17:48] <jle2002> to use ajax
[13:17:54] <jle2002> then it doesnt populate until the second click
[13:17:56] <jle2002> it seems
[13:18:34] <BillCriswell> It would do that even without the post.
[13:18:50] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/qN483/4/ like so.
[13:19:30] <BillCriswell> You should wait till the form is validated, then do the ajax request, the populate the select in the success of ajax call.
[13:19:53] <jle2002> thats what i did
[13:19:59] <jle2002> it required me to click twice
[13:20:33] <jle2002> can u try it with echo?
[13:21:13] <jle2002> billcriswell
[13:21:22] <BillCriswell> jle2002: Don't know what you mean.
[13:21:23] <jle2002> can u try the focus one with an ajax simulation?
[13:21:38] <jle2002> well
[13:22:06] <jle2002> it seems like if i do a $post and populate the dropdownlist on success.  it requires me to click on the dropdownlist twice before it populates
[13:22:32] <BillCriswell> Are you setting off the ajax request when you click the select element?
[13:22:39] <jle2002> yes
[13:22:46] <jle2002> no
[13:22:57] <jle2002> $('#@Model.Id').mousedown(function () {                                         $.post('@Url.Content("~/Box/PopulateBoxSelect")', serializeForm() + '&configId=@(Model.ConfigId)', function (data) {                                              })
[13:23:19] <jle2002> is what i have now
[13:24:00] <jle2002> .success(function (data) {                         var items = "<option value=''>Please Select</option>";                         items += data;                         $('#@Model.Id').html(items);                     });
[13:24:06] <jle2002> thats the populate part
[13:24:56] <jle2002> billcriswell can u use echo to simulate an ajax call?
[13:25:00] <jle2002> with jslint
[13:25:07] <jle2002> jsfiddle rather
[13:25:58] <bfig> syborg, thanks for the information :). very helpful
[13:27:24] <jle2002> BillCriswell:  this works just fine
[13:27:25] <jle2002> http://jsfiddle.net/F9pez/5/
[13:27:29] <jle2002> the problem is
[13:27:36] <jle2002> when i try to populate it using Post
[13:27:38] <jle2002> ajax call
[13:27:46] <jle2002> it has to take 2 clicks
[13:29:23] <astropirate> Does Object.seal() work with objects that have a constructor? I cant seem to be able to get it to work  http://pastie.org/4898780
[13:30:07] <jle2002> BillCriswell?
[13:30:50] <BillCriswell> jle2002: I explained whatI think you should do.
[13:31:19] <jle2002> what is taht
[13:33:38] <BillCriswell> What I said at the start. You have to populate the select after the data you need is collected, not when they click or focus on the select.
[13:34:16] <hlve> alright, so I'm on the right track. Now, what would be the best way to add an ID (with an increment of +1, so Pane1, Pane2, etc.) to every wrapping div?
[13:34:24] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/Rxk4S/16/
[13:37:37] <BillCriswell> hlve: http://jsfiddle.net/Rxk4S/17/
[13:39:56] <bubu> can anyone explain how the unique ID technique works to prevent duplicate form submissions?
[13:41:31] <bfig> bubu, you have a form and in the server you make sure the id has been received only once in the last T time
[13:42:20] <bfig> if i press twice, the first time it goes to the server, the id hasn't been registered so the function works. the second time, the server detects it has already accepted a form with this ID and rejects it
[13:42:44] <bfig> bubu, makes sense?
[13:42:49] <BillCriswell> That's an interesting approach.
[13:42:55] <bubu> so the server is maintaing a list of these IDs?
[13:43:07] <bubu> maintaining*
[13:43:55] <hlve> BillCriswell, tyvm!
[13:44:11] <BillCriswell> hlve: No problem at all.
[13:44:26] <hlve> reading your code and learning. I've up until now only dived into very basic jquery
[13:45:06] <BillCriswell> It's a good time.
[13:46:08] <slartsa> Dumb question; http://jsfiddle.net/JqDMR/189/ how could I get this to work with latest jquery?
[13:47:34] <chico_chicote> hey guys
[13:47:37] <slartsa> uh, ok that page doesn't work as supposed, it should hide the <p> when mouseout
[13:48:19] <chico_chicote> i have an app that submits a form using ajax (through the ajaxForm plugin: www.malsup.com/jquery/form/) to a ruby/sinatra backend
[13:48:20] <Eviltwin> slartsa: Perhaps like this: http://jsfiddle.net/JqDMR/190/
[13:49:06] <chico_chicote> in the development server (webrick) it works as intended, but in the production server (apache w/ passenger), the backend works, but the answer always triggers the 'error' callback
[13:49:09] <chico_chicote> any pointers?
[13:49:32] <slartsa> Eviltwin: like that! I love you
[14:01:14] <scott[8]> if i'm waiting for a div id to get content rendered, do i need to put a .change watcher on the div? or can i just do a (document).ready with an If statement?

[14:12:14] <NoiseEee> tias?
[14:12:38] <starpile> Hello... i've been tiasing for days
[14:13:40] <NoiseEee> is that a multi-select or something?
[14:13:53] <NoiseEee> ie: why are you searching selected vs just the value?

[14:17:58] <starpile> NoiseEee that's the jam thanks - I came up with this about the same time: $('.author-disclosure-relationship option:selected[value="other"]')
[14:19:20] <NoiseEee> right, but my bigger question is why are you selecting/filtering both "selected" and "value" ?  do you have options with the same value in that <select>  or more than one thing selected??
[14:21:10] <BillCriswell> Is it a multi-select?
[14:21:56] <NoiseEee> thats what i was axin' before
[14:22:07] <NoiseEee> but i guess only starpile will know
[14:22:11] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[14:22:22] <BillCriswell> I only caught the end of that.
[14:22:25] <BillCriswell> Should have scrolled.
[14:28:21] <BillCriswell> Night1
[14:28:59] <chare> If i add stuff like divs with jquery do their onload functions get called?
[14:29:11] <NoiseEee> divs don't have a "load" event
[14:30:26] <chare> NoiseEee: then how does the <div id="listener"> work in the tutorial at https://developers.google.com/native-client/devguide/tutorial
[14:36:19] <hlve> Ah.

[14:36:47] <gregf> Question... using jQuery - how do i get the _type_ of element that my jquery object is created on? i.e "select" or "form" or "div" >
[14:37:40] <sisb> I went AFK, can anyone see if my question was answered please?
[14:37:50] <sisb> My logs only go up 100 lines :S
[14:38:46] <hlve> sisb: how long ago was it?
[14:39:52] <chare> hlve: use rails

[14:41:48] <phiz> any ideas on how i can get events to run off the second button?
[14:41:50] <phiz> i am stumped
[14:42:07] <lovetocode> why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/eXbTC/
[14:42:29] <Whirl3d__> phiz, assign an event handler for click events to the parent elements of your buttons.
[14:42:57] <phiz> Whirl3d__: i thought i was doing that
[14:43:57] <phiz> Whirl3d__: $("#divhtml").on("click", "#alertifclicked", function() { alert("i was clicked 5"); }); ?
[14:44:39] <lovetocode>  http://jsfiddle.net/eXbTC/
[14:46:13] <Whirl3d__> phiz, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/rmfVF/10/
[14:46:33] <Whirl3d__> don't use alert, it's terrible. Try using console.log instead
[14:47:59] <sisb> Is there any way to get these two position fixed divs to obey the width of their parent? http://jsfiddle.net/4bGqF/
[14:48:00] <grey> Is there a good plugin for doing a nice animated shuffle of a list?
[14:48:04] <phiz> Whirl3d__: what would the parent be if the button wasn't in that div though?
[14:48:39] <sisb> Wrong link, this is the right one: http://jsfiddle.net/4bGqF/387/
[14:48:45] <lovetocode> I'm having trouble with some elements showing, http://jsfiddle.net/eXbTC/
[14:49:36] <jrockjiggz> Hi, I have a weird bug.. I am setting $opener = $('el').  if I console.log( $opener ); I get an element, but that element doesnt seeem to be in the dom?

[14:53:10] <Whirl3d__> phiz, maybe this will help: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/rmfVF/19/
[14:53:58] <jrockjiggz> nm..
[14:54:35] <phiz> Whirl3d__: i appreciate it, i am just trying to understand the logic in the code
[14:55:18] <Whirl3d__> All of the buttons fire the click event. But you only listen for the click event on the button's parent element (buttonHolder)
[14:55:24] <nFFF> guys not sure why but whenever i refresh the page some debugging shit is pausing at breakpoints in google chrome
[14:55:30] <nFFF> whatve i done to activate this ?
[14:56:02] <Whirl3d__> Then, when the click event happens, it passes an event object with it. One of the attributes of the event object is target (e.target) which tells which element was the target of the event.
[14:56:04] <lovetocode> could someone please look at this
[14:56:07] <Whirl3d__> in this case, the target of the click
[14:56:08] <lovetocode> http://jsfiddle.net/eXbTC/
[14:56:09] <hlve> you activated the "break at breaking point"
[14:56:42] <hlve> er, chrome calls it the 'Pause on Exceptions'
[14:57:28] <hlve> nFFF: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=91666
[14:58:08] <lovetocode> ??????
[14:58:09] <hlve> you can right-click any breakpoint in the Breakpoints pane and voila! The "Remove All JavaScript Breakpoints" popup menu item!
[14:58:20] <lovetocode> is this a help chat?
[14:58:29] <hlve> lovetocode, not if you're not going to be nice, it isn't.
[14:58:42] <vacho_> can someone PLEASE help me?
[14:58:42] <hlve> what do you need help with?
[14:58:43] <vacho_> http://pastebin.com/UxCxB7CX
[14:58:47] <vacho_> why is this form not submitting?
[14:58:52] <lovetocode> I am being nice, just no ones answering me
[14:59:05] <hlve> lovetocode, there are tons of people getting questions answered, just be patient.
[14:59:10] <vacho_> ajpiano:  :)
[14:59:20] <lovetocode> ok
[14:59:27] <Whirl3d__> phiz, here I have written comments line by line: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/rmfVF/25/
[14:59:59] <vacho_> hive: the form is loading by ajax, so I think its not finding it.. it's submitting but it's submitting something completely empty
[15:00:01] <hlve> vacho_, is it hitting any breaking points?
[15:00:32] <phiz> Whirl3d__: cool, thank you very much
[15:00:38] <phiz> i appreciate it
[15:00:49] <nFFF> hlve thanks
[15:01:02] <vacho_> hlve: it's submitting but the form submission is empty, post body is empty
[15:01:16] <hlve> one sec.
[15:03:20] <Whirl3d__> phiz, no problem. Lemme know if you still have questions.
[15:03:48] <phiz> will do, thanks again
[15:04:44] <hlve> vacho_, http://pastebin.com/3BLKTTjZ
[15:04:54] <hlve> See if that works at all.
[15:06:08] <vacho_> hlve: can't see any difference?
[15:06:14] <vacho_> what did u change?
[15:06:48] <hlve> er. oops.
[15:06:57] <hlve> didn't paste my fixed one lol
[15:07:01] <hlve> one sec.
[15:07:49] <hlve> can you double check to make sure your ID for your form is actually asset-status-form?
[15:09:03] <phiz> Whirl3d__: what's the significance of it being the first button?
[15:09:22] <hlve> lovetocode, while I'm waiting on him, what did you need halp with?
[15:11:18] <hlve> vacho_, also see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/768163/1473362  -- sounds like it could be possibly related.
[15:13:01] <lovetocode> thanks hlve, well on jsfiddle it wasn't displaying the same way on my site, but anyway its not showing the nect menu, and on my site its overlapping the other #'s when I want it to display right under its parent
[15:13:10] <lovetocode> this might be a css issue
[15:13:29] <hlve> sounds like a css(z-index specifically) issue ;P
[15:13:38] <vacho_> hlve: id is crrect.
[15:13:44] <vacho_> hlve: ID is correct.
[15:13:49] <hlve> vacho_, check out the link I posted.
[15:13:51] <Whirl3d__> phiz, something arbitrary just for demonstration...
[15:13:59] <hlve> http://stackoverflow.com/a/768163/1473362
[15:14:32] <Whirl3d__> I just wanted to show you how you can use the target to do different things based on which element was clicked. So I gave the first element some special power to make new buttons is all
[15:15:14] <phiz> Whirl3d__: ahh cool
[15:15:25] <phiz> Whirl3d__: i think it is starting to absorb.
[15:15:37] <vacho_> hlve: I see..thanks
[15:15:53] <vacho_> mine is submitting, just not that form :(
[15:16:23] <phiz> Whirl3d__: the selector on the button is kind of ugly because of using bootstrap.  it is button#modifyButton.btn.btn-small.btn-primary... when referring to it in jquery do i have to use that whole string>
[15:16:42] <vacho_> hlve: trying this:  data: $(this).find('form')first().serialize(),
[15:16:48] <hlve> can you upload it anywhere, vacho_, so I can get a closer look?
[15:16:54] <hlve> kk
[15:17:00] <phiz> it's actually html > body > div > div > #passwdView > form > div > div.controls > button#modifyButton.btn.btn-small.btn-primary
[15:17:45] <Whirl3d__> phiz, if the button has an id, it's unique to that element. So you can just use the id
[15:18:19] <phiz> Whirl3d__: so in that case what would the parent be?
[15:18:39] <Whirl3d__> you could always use $("#buttonid").parent() if you needed
[15:18:54] <Whirl3d__> but you want to grab any element that is common to all the elements you are adding
[15:19:11] <phiz> Whirl3d__: but that button doesn't exist yet when i need to do that .on() statement
[15:19:25] <lovetocode> hlve, could you please help me out, thanks
[15:19:32] <Whirl3d__> so it might need to be up two or three levels in the heirarchy. The important part is that the event bubbles up. Catch it on the nearest common relative.
[15:20:02] <hlve> lovetocode, you haven't posted any of your code, so there's nothing I can do to help...
[15:20:04] <hlve> lol
[15:20:18] <lovetocode> I haven't
[15:20:27] <Whirl3d__> Just like the buttons I created in the fiddle. They didn't exist either, but it didn't matter cause I was listening for their events on their holder
[15:20:30] <phiz> Whirl3d__: how do you use multiple levels in the selector?
[15:20:38] <phiz> ahh
[15:20:45] <lovetocode> oh I thought I did earlier, here it is http://jsfiddle.net/eXbTC/
[15:20:46] <phiz> i thought it had to exist already
[15:21:32] <Whirl3d__> In the demo I made, you click the first button and it dynamically adds a button. You can still get the button click eent on the newly added buttons because the listener exists on it's holder before it was made
[15:21:33] <phiz> it would be something like $("div#passwdView > form > div > div.controls").on("click", function() { ... }); ?
[15:21:40] <hlve> lovetocode, so explain what you're doing, and what's not working here
[15:21:53] <Whirl3d__> no need for div#
[15:22:00] <phiz> Whirl3d__: the rest is right though?
[15:22:11] <Whirl3d__> I believe so
[15:22:38] <phiz> so $("#passwdView > form > div > div.controls") or $("form > div > div.controls") ?
[15:22:38] <lovetocode> hlve, first, the child of the li is not showing upon clicking it
[15:22:40] <Whirl3d__> And make sure you use .on("click", function (e) {   you need to have the e there to get at it later
[15:22:51] <phiz> ahh right
[15:23:15] <phiz> thank you for bearing with me on that
[15:23:16] <Whirl3d__> $("div#passwd") is not as good as $("#passwd")
[15:23:35] <phiz> $("#passwd") is more specific than $("div#passwd") ?
[15:23:57] <Whirl3d__> Think about it like this. one says: select a single element with id:passowrd
[15:24:10] <Whirl3d__> the other says, select all divs, then grab the id:password one
[15:25:06] <lovetocode> I gotta go soon
[15:25:22] <phiz> ahh got it
[15:26:15] <phiz> thanks again Whirl3d__ ...i will try and put this into practice and let it simmer for a bit.
[15:26:18] <phiz> i appreciate it.

[15:41:02] <sisb> Does anyone know if the modernizr library functions like prefix free or do I need to include that as well?
[15:42:52] <AfterShock> Is there something special that needs to be done to get jQuery working in jsfiddle?
[15:43:25] <AfterShock> I was preparing a demo of my problem to ask a question, and even the most basic setup seems to not work.
[15:44:14] <sisb> include it on the left hand side
[15:44:30] <sisb> where it says include framework
[15:44:42] <AfterShock> Framework: onDomReady, jQuery 1.8.2... in HTML, a couple of ULs with LIs, some styling in CSS, and a single sortable attached to ul in javascript.
[15:45:08] <AfterShock> The ULs come up, but not sortable.
[15:45:39] <AfterShock> I started with the code in a ready function and some other stuff, and backed it up all the way to just a bare $('ul').sortable()
[15:46:31] <faraway> AfterShock: did you also include jquery ui ... sortable is not part of jquery itselfe but jquery-ui
[15:46:44] <AfterShock> Ah, good point.
[15:47:04] <AfterShock> "Add Resources"?
[15:47:58] <faraway> AfterShock: for jquery 1.8 you need to use add resource
[15:49:21] <AfterShock> somewhat surprised jqueryui isn't included
[15:51:19] <faraway> AfterShock: for jquery 1.7.2 you have the option to choose to load jquery-ui. probably they wait for the 1.9 release
[15:52:22] <AfterShock> faraway: ah, I see
[15:52:56] <JaredCE> i can make a list of all indexes in a select that have an option with a value in another list, but i can't seem to make a list of the indexes that don't appear in that list
[15:53:10] <imsky> talk to me buddy

[15:53:12] <imsky> i can help you
[15:53:37] <AfterShock> Adding jqueryui and even jquery regsiters on the panel, but doesn't help the fiddle script... maybe I should drop to 1.7.2
[15:53:41] <razzi> JaredCE, got a fiddle?
[15:53:47] <JaredCE> http://jsfiddle.net/Df5GA/3/ i have this
[15:54:32] <AfterShock> Okay, that works. I'll try building my example in that. Hopefully sortables haven't changed too much.
[15:56:58] <imsky> JaredCE: wow that looks busted
[15:57:09] <JaredCE> err yey?
[15:57:16] <imsky> err no :(
[15:57:24] <JaredCE> hah
[15:57:30] <JaredCE> whats so busted about it
[15:57:36] <vjt> w/
[15:58:10] <imsky> JaredCE: lots of things. explain dataidx/noidx
[15:59:50] <faraway> AfterShock: hmm, strange .. last time i tried, it worked that way without problems
[16:00:32] <JaredCE> dataidx would be the index list of the options that exist in dataitems (in the lstitems select). noidx is what i'm struggling with, making a list of the indexes that aren't in dataitems (in the lstitems select)
[16:01:06] <imsky> ok so in your example, noidx would be 1,3 and dataidx would be 2,4
[16:01:26] <JaredCE> imsky: so for this example, dataitems has the values 2 and 4. dataidx would contain 1,3 and no idx 0,2
[16:01:45] <imsky> 0,2?
[16:02:13] <imsky> there are 4 items, so wouldn't it be 1,3 to start with?
[16:02:14] <razzi> Jaac, http://jsfiddle.net/VuQcd/
[16:02:15] <imsky> see this is what's busted
[16:02:21] <razzi> JaredCE, http://jsfiddle.net/VuQcd/
[16:02:22] <imsky> you're using various indices
[16:02:40] <JaredCE> imsky, the indexes start from 0
[16:02:48] <motaka2> Hello I have form, it has a combo bax but it is disabled that means <select disbaled ... > but when it is disabled it doesnt pass it's value as a variable to the application what can I do ?
[16:02:51] <imsky> look at razzi's solution friend
[16:02:56] <imsky> i think he fixed your horrible code
[16:03:43] <imsky> good luck with it when indexes go into the 10s!
[16:05:20] <JaredCE> well thats why i came here for help
[16:06:22] <faraway> motaka2: well disabled elements should not be submitted, because they are disabled ;)
[16:06:26] <JaredCE> razzi, the reason i used the map function was because dataitems would normally be json. would this still work?
[16:06:38] <faraway> motaka2: thats defined in the html specs
[16:08:10] <razzi> JaredCE, yes but you'll need to use .parseJSON() first
[16:09:33] <JaredCE> hmm ok
[16:12:02] <Whirl3d__> is html5 boilerplate easy to implement. I just downloaded version 4 and I am not sure where to start.

[16:34:19] <AfterShock> pismobook: You have a typo, change it from juquery.com to jquery.com
[16:34:39] <tw2113> pismobook, there's a typo in "jquery" in the url
[16:34:59] <tw2113> but even that gives 404
[16:35:06] <tw2113> http://jquery.com/jquery-1.6.3.min.js
[16:35:24] <pismobook> which part should i change? this error happen while i did't do anything to the web
[16:35:42] <tw2113> get a better source to pull the library from
[16:35:46] <AfterShock> pismobook: You might also want to get a writer or copy editor to revise your text on that page.
[16:35:50] <tw2113> even that url i pasted above is 404
[16:36:04] <tw2113> grab a copy from the google CDN or so
[16:36:14] <AfterShock> tw2113: yeah, good move
[16:37:08] <pismobook> where should i change the url? sorry, i'm a newbie
[16:38:24] <AfterShock> pismobook: find 'juquery' in the text of that page
[16:38:53] <tw2113> <script type='text/javascript' src='http://dev.infinetworks.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.7.2'></script>
[16:39:41] <tw2113> something, somewhere is trying to access that old jquery link in a fail way
[16:41:11] <pismobook> where can i find this script text? sorry my english is not very good
[16:41:29] <pismobook> not my first language :-)
[16:42:00] <AfterShock> pismobook: you know what? just drop off the "?ver=1.7.2" ... looks like it is already a copy of jquery when accessed without that
[16:44:11] <pismobook> AfterShock: where can i find this script to edit?
[16:48:17] <sunbeam> i'd like to give all <a> that have title="new" a certain class (new-button)

[17:11:49] <aamax> hi all i'm fairly new to Jquery/javascript.  a quick question:  I have a drop down box (select) on my form and if the user changes the value I have a popup that tries to confirm the change.. if they select cancel I want it to reset the value to what it was before (which I've saved) at the end of the transaction the html shows the correct option selected but the actual form has the select sitting on the first option value in the drop down
[17:11:49] <aamax>  why would it do this?
[17:13:42] <shoky> ?p @aamax
[17:13:43] <bot-t> aamax, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:15:07] <aamax> http://jsfiddle.net/8FC7x/
[17:15:09] <aamax> thx
[17:18:02] <shoky> aamax: are you setting that .data("value") anywhere..
[17:18:27] <aamax> yes.  and i've verified that at run time it is the value of the text for the option prior to the change
[17:20:18] <shoky> aamax: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/8FC7x/2/
[17:21:21] <aamax> hmmm must be some other code messing with it then i guess.. <scratches head>
[17:22:22] <aamax> i haven't used fiddle b4.  where is the box after the cancel is selected?
[17:22:33] <shoky> what box?
[17:22:45] <aamax> and to test we'd have to start with something other than 'a' as the value. box=select
[17:23:02] <shoky> wat
[17:24:40] <aamax> ok.  I have a form with this select box on it.  the value in the form starts out as what I have in the fiddle now...
[17:25:04] <shoky> aamax: dont tell me about it, put it up in the fiddle and link to an updated fiddle
[17:25:36] <aamax> if the user sets the select to something.  and then hits cancel.  what is the selected option in the select box after.  I did update the fiddle.
[17:25:47] <aamax> http://jsfiddle.net/8FC7x/3/
[17:26:47] <shoky> aamax: your code is counting on there being a prev_value
[17:27:02] <shoky> so put data-value="ColumnPanel" on the <select>
[17:27:26] <shoky> or set it in the code at startup..
[17:27:58] <aamax> i'm using chrome and at run time, if i put a break point on the line after the var prev_value =   the prev_value is set to the text of the option
[17:29:02] <aamax> http://jsfiddle.net/8FC7x/5/
[17:29:13] <aamax> i added the initializer code that wasn't in the fiddle before
[17:29:36] <shoky> why .text() ?
[17:29:41] <shoky> you want .val()
[17:30:27] <aamax> k.  I'll try that.  thx
[17:30:53] <shoky> but
[17:31:05] <aamax> you rock that works great.
[17:31:07] <aamax> but....
[17:31:12] <aamax> ???
[17:31:20] <shoky> this would be nicer:  $("#panel_graph_type").data("value", function() { return this.value });
[17:31:31] <shoky> er
[17:32:05] <shoky> damn .data()
[17:32:37] <shoky> this then: $("#panel_graph_type").data("value", $("#panel_graph_type").val() );
[17:32:59] <shoky> the select's value is automatically set to the selected option's value
[17:33:23] <aamax> awesome. :D
[17:36:48] <aamax> shaky that worked great.  another bug bites the dust
[17:37:04] <ajpiano> woo shoky another nickel for me
[17:37:05] <ajpiano> :p
[17:37:34] <aamax> shoky. not shaky  my bad
[17:50:13] <rsumi> i have an ajax call happening on keyup when a user types something into an input box. too many ajax calls happen when a user types in an email address. should just happen when the user stops typing. is there a way to do this? like add some kind of delay or osmething?
[17:50:48] <johnkpaul> ?g throttle debounce jquery plugin @ rsumi
[17:50:51] <bot-t> rsumi, Ben Alman  jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[17:51:20] <johnkpaul> rsumi: look into that plugin
[17:51:24] <johnkpaul> it should give you what you need
[17:55:49] <xentris> does anyone have ie9? I'm trying to figure out if my site works on that browser using html5 and jquery but I don't have access to a machine that has ie9.
[17:56:31] <xentris> if anyone could take a quick look, would be great. No sure if I'm allowed to post the link in this channel.
[17:57:07] <ajpiano> posting links to demonstrations of behaviour failing is not only allowed, it is encouraged
[17:57:44] <xentris> oh okay, well the site is http://gifttemplate.com
[17:57:49] <rsumi> johnkpaul: cool thats what i needed
[17:57:58] <xentris> I'm looking to see if the certificate making part works under ie9
[17:58:08] <xentris> you can just enter any random text
[17:58:21] <xentris> click create and let me know if it updates the image or not
[17:58:28] <xentris> would really help thank you
[18:00:17] <RobW> hey guys, I have a menu that's for mobile.. and would like to be able to "drag" open or closed... right now it works solely by clicking it
[18:00:49] <RobW> http://pastebin.com/gbiW94cQ here's the code
[18:01:07] <RobW> which works fine - but would like to figure out how to do dragging
[18:02:11] <ajpiano> xentris: however, we typically only support with specific issues not just integration testing :p
[18:02:17] <ajpiano> xentris: that said, it does appear to work in IE9
[18:02:34] <ajpiano> both the "Create" and "Display for IE9" buton
[18:02:38] <xentris> ajpiano: thank you, that was my biggest concern
[18:02:38] <ajpiano> but doing both makes two images
[18:02:46] <snover> xentris: http://browserstack.com
[18:02:51] <xentris> yeah that's the way it's meant to do it
[18:03:06] <xentris> for ie9
[18:03:32] <xentris> snover: thanks of the link
[18:03:54] <johnkpaul> RobW: you can do something very similar with the touch events as you do with clicking
[18:04:14] <johnkpaul> there are a lot of complexities w/touching and clicking but the basics are trhe same
[18:04:14] <johnkpaul> RobW: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4755505/how-to-recognize-touch-events-using-jquery-in-safari-for-ipad-is-it-possible
[18:05:06] <RobW> :|
[18:05:09] <RobW> hmm
[18:14:14] <RobW> anyone help with that?
[18:33:02] <RobW> Can anyone help with mobile menu open/close by dragging?
[18:33:14] <adlwalrus> Hi all, can anyone help me test something on IE?
[19:40:00] <scar> is there a friendly jquery slider with zooming capabilities? so not only will it do thumbnails, but also allow zoom?
[20:27:57] <chare> http://jsfiddle.net/GQhSH/1/
[20:28:06] <chare> how do i put <script> into a string
[20:39:24] <adlwalrus> chare: http://jsfiddle.net/GQhSH/9/
[20:39:52] <adlwalrus> chare: do you have internet explorer installed?
[20:40:11] <chare> wtf i'm using chrome 22 on linux
[20:40:29] <chare> chrome 22 linux buggy piece of shit ?
[20:40:34] <adlwalrus> chare: I need someone who does to help me test something.
[20:40:51] <adlwalrus> chare: but check out my fiddle, its fixed for you.
[20:41:01] <chare> wtf add a +?
[20:41:23] <chare> why doesn't just a normal string work
[20:41:47] <adlwalrus> chare: because when the fiddle renders in the viewport pane, it uses an inline script tag.
[20:42:04] <adlwalrus> when the browser parses HTML, it opens a script element and parses as JS.
[20:42:19] <adlwalrus> ...until it encounters the string "</script>"
[20:42:30] <adlwalrus> so you split it up and the HTML parser doesn't get tripped up.
[20:44:45] <shoky> <got ie
[20:45:06] <adlwalrus> shoky: sweet, man.
[20:45:06] <adlwalrus> http://jsbin.com/epavil/1
[20:45:13] <adlwalrus> shoky: you get an alert msg in that?
[20:45:18] <adlwalrus> and does clicking asdf change it to fdsa?
[20:46:00] <shoky> no and no
[20:48:10] <moxie_> hey all. I'm wondering if something is possible.  I've got a draggable initialized on the page.  Would it be possible for me to mousedown over a separate area and have the draggable snap to my mouse location and start dragging around
[20:48:35] <adlwalrus> shoky: any idea why?
[20:53:08] <shoky> adlwalrus:  maybe  the </s   has something to do with it :P
[20:54:41] <adlwalrus> shoky: hahaha
[20:55:12] <adlwalrus> shoky: http://jsbin.com/epavil/2/edit
[20:55:26] <adlwalrus> shoky: http://jsbin.com/epavil/10/edit
[20:56:55] <shoky> it alerts but doesn't switch button text
[20:57:49] <adlwalrus> shoky: you know why?
[20:59:43] <adlwalrus> shoky: any feedback? http://hpaste.org/75688
[21:00:21] <shoky> adlwalrus: because 'this' is the window object
[21:01:28] <shoky> adlwalrus: try  e.srcElement.innerHTML = 'fdsa';
[21:02:16] <shoky> well, dont try cause you dont have ie
[21:02:22] <shoky> but, it works.
[21:09:24] <scar> is there a friendly jquery slider with zooming capabilities? so not only will it do thumbnails, but also allow zoom?
[21:10:08] <adlwalrus> shoky: sorry, my connection chopped off for a sec.
[21:12:32] <shoky> [06:00:22] <shoky> adlwalrus: because 'this' is the window object
[21:12:32] <shoky> [06:01:29] <shoky> adlwalrus: try  e.srcElement.innerHTML = 'fdsa';
[21:13:23] <adlwalrus> shoky: is e.srcElement the IE-equivalent of WHATWG's e.target?
[21:13:28] <adlwalrus> shoky: any feedback? http://hpaste.org/75688
[21:14:06] <shoky> i dunno what's the equivalent of what, but yea i suppose.
[21:14:14] <shoky> and uh, no feedback really..
[21:14:32] <shoky> it's not like i have any idea what you're trying to do and why
[21:14:44] <adlwalrus> shoky: oh, sorry.
[21:14:47] <shoky> nor what bonzo or $.aug is, etc.
[21:14:59] <adlwalrus> its cross-browser event handling for bonzo, the ender dom utility.
[21:15:05] <adlwalrus> jquery on a diet.
[21:15:23] <adlwalrus> $.aug is for extending it (in this case to give it basic event handling)
[21:15:48] <shoky> still no feedback ;]
[21:16:34] <shoky> i mean
[21:16:44] <shoky> it seems like you know how to call functions properly. good job
[21:18:44] <adlwalrus> shoky: sorry. I'm still learning. it's a little more complex than that, because it has to work on collections?
[21:19:01] <austinbv> How do you make something draggable outside of it's containing div?
[21:20:50] <shoky> adlwalrus: sorry, i donno what feedback you want.. the code looks clean. if it works as good as jquery, then thats good too. good job !!!
[21:24:08] <shoky> austinbv: if you dont have overflow:hidden on the container it should just work.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nhBxq/23/
[21:24:53] <shoky> it's all css in the end
[21:25:07] <austinbv> shakey I have overflow-x hidden overflow-y visible
[21:25:11] <adlwalrus> shoky: do you know how jquery takes care of the e.srcElement vs. e.target problem?
[21:25:48] <austinbv> er shoky x scroll y hidden
[21:25:50] <adlwalrus> shoky: I mean, if I do $('a').click(function(e) { e.target.innerHTML = 'fdsa'; });, then will it fail on ie?
[21:26:24] <austinbv> yeah it does not like the x scroll
[21:26:26] <shoky> adlwalrus:
[21:26:31] <shoky> if ( !event.target ) {
[21:26:31] <shoky> 			event.target = originalEvent.srcElement || document;
[21:26:32] <shoky> 		}
[21:26:47] <adlwalrus> shoky: it doesn't fail, right?
[21:27:22] <shoky> adlwalrus: jquery provides its own extended event object
[21:27:34] <shoky> as that code exemplifies
[21:27:57] <chare> Is there some way to do this?      document.getElementById('title').insertHtmlBefore("big long html string")
[21:28:07] <chare> to insert html without using createelement
[21:28:17] <shoky> chare: $('#title').before("bla bla bla")
[21:37:51] <Sgeo> When I'm using the ajax thing for long-polling, is it ok if the server sends headers but waits to send complete body, or am I supposed to delay headers too?
[21:55:21] <adlwalrus> shoky: cool, man.
[21:57:17] <Shai_Tan> is ti possible to select a field in a given form eg: $('#form_name.field_name').clic
[21:58:20] <adlwalrus> shoky: you know offhand whether eventhandlers will ever be passed more than one argument (the event object)?
[22:33:54] <bubu> my forms will sometimes (randomly) submit multiple times... any ideas why?
[22:34:11] <adlwalrus> thanks for the info, shoky
[22:49:42] <buzzedword> hey guys, shoky just reminded me: how does :before() and :after() perform whilst moving dom elements around?
[22:49:56] <buzzedword> i currently do it manually, but i'm wondering if they have a magicsauce perf gain
[22:50:33] <buzzedword> i can't imagine so, but hey
[22:57:42] <hariom> How to delete a cookie? I am using cookie plugin
[22:59:00] <coldhead> $.removeCookie('the_cookie');
[22:59:28] <coldhead> it would be cool if that plugin had documentation that explained such things
[22:59:31] <coldhead> ah well
[23:00:38] <hariom> It is not doing it. when I try $.removeCookie('test') it gives me response 'true' but when I check $.cookie('test') it also gives me reply the value of the cookie test
[23:02:29] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1623728/i-cant-delete-a-cookie-with-jquery-plugin
[23:02:35] <coldhead> try the answers there?
[23:07:08] <hanasaki> what is the recommended way to attach a onclick function to "mybutton"?
[23:09:23] <coldhead> what is myButton?
[23:09:32] <hariom> coldhead: expire: -5 doesn't work
[23:09:44] <coldhead> $('#some_id').click(function () { ... } );
[23:09:45] <hanasaki>   <button name="buttonGetParkedCars">getparkedcars</button>
[23:10:03] <coldhead> can you give it an id and use the above?
[23:11:09] <hanasaki> what is the <button name    verses the <button id  ??
[23:12:59] <buzzedword> coldhead: is this the plugin you're referring to? https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[23:13:33] <coldhead> are you using the latest version? it works great for me here http://jsfiddle.net/jM9Ec/
[23:13:46] <coldhead> buzzedword: yes
[23:13:59] <coldhead> hanasaki: id is faster for the browser to find
[23:14:05] <coldhead> searching for stuff by name is more work
[23:14:16] <coldhead> $('button[name="some_name"]')
[23:14:19] <coldhead> and more typing
[23:14:57] <hanasaki> so I use use id='blahblah'  on my button not name= ??
[23:14:59] <buzzedword> that's what i thought-- it has the reference in documentation for removing the cookie. hariom, is it unclear there in any way? i'll open a pull to clear those docs up if need be
[23:15:52] <coldhead> it's perfectly clear, buzzedword, i was being facetious
[23:16:02] <coldhead> hanasaki: you can use ID and name, if you like
[23:16:08] <coldhead> but for jQuery purposes ID is better
[23:16:16] <coldhead> you might need name for some other reason!
[23:16:25] <hanasaki> ok thanks /  should the id be in the single or double quotes?
[23:17:09] <buzzedword> coldhead: i got that. just trying to see if there's maybe a fundamental misunderstanding there-- i have an open fork on that repo right now is why i'm asking
[23:17:24] <buzzedword> just figured if its something that is legit a problem, i'll chuck it in now
[23:17:57] <hariom> coldhead: it appears that a cookie set by the server (in response), is not reseting by $.cookie
[23:19:33] <coldhead> hanasaki: single or double, it's up to you!
[23:20:06] <coldhead> hariom: that might be a problem at the server side?
[23:20:11] <coldhead> it might be sending the wrong value?
[23:20:14] <coldhead> cookies are hard, man
[23:20:36] <hanasaki> coldhead:  that's a nice javascript feature...
[23:20:54] <hanasaki> so how do  you figure out why a javascript function is not being called?
[23:21:45] <hanasaki> the page has <button id='buttonGetParkedCars'>getparkedcars</button>   and the .js file has $('#buttonGetParkedCars').on('click', getParkedCars);
[23:28:59] <friskd> Hey all,   I have a drop down menu, and i'm trying to capture only the click on the second level category: http://imagebin.org/230721
[23:29:27] <friskd> My problem is that when i click on the second level category, as shown in image, it also registers a click for the parent level category.
[23:30:24] <friskd> I need to be able to click a level 1 category or  a level 2, but i'm having trouble trying to figure out how to capture only the second level event without triggering the click on the level 1 category.
[23:30:39] <friskd> Any ideas?
[23:31:16] <friskd> In my example clicking on li w/ category-id=86 also triggers a click on 85
[23:32:27] <coldhead> ?ready @ hanasaki

[23:36:30] <hanasaki> any idea why a firebug (in firefox) debug window closes when the page is reloaded with the firefox reload button?  it also looses all the break points
[23:41:50] <friskd> awesome coldhead thanks!!!
[23:41:54] <friskd> bot-t: thanks!

[23:42:46] <coldhead> hanasaki: my firebug has been acting up lately too
[23:42:53] <coldhead> i moved to yon chrome web inspector
[23:43:36] <hanasaki> I have been avoiding chrome.. except on my phone
[23:43:54] <coldhead> well it's a matter for yourself, as they say in the legal industry
[23:44:25] <hanasaki> oy .. you are a lawyer?
[23:44:51] <coldhead> no no
[23:44:56] <coldhead> i just enjoy the legal system
[23:45:07] <hanasaki> enjoy?
[23:45:08] <coldhead> mostly i like telling people that things are a matter for themselves
[23:45:23] <coldhead> that's probably the best part of the law, from what i've seen
[23:47:06] <hanasaki> hurah for torte reform
[23:48:33] <coldhead> mmm cake

[23:49:00] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[23:49:00] <bot-t> ;)
[23:49:04] <hanasaki> for this code any idea why it goes past error and success?  http://pastebin.com/GsFWBZLr
[23:49:09] <coldhead> bot-t: are you in support of cake reform?
[23:49:09] <bot-t> coldhead, Better not tell you now.
[23:50:06] <hanasaki> coldhead:  you could vote for the cake party in a few weeks :)
[23:51:16] <coldhead> hanasaki: i would remove this part from the URL http://localhost:8088
[23:51:23] <coldhead> keep it relative for simplicity
[23:51:49] <hanasaki> the url is getting called and has a resonse code of 200
[23:52:07] <coldhead> try taking out the contentType
[23:52:27] <hanasaki> shouldn't it at least hit the failure or done code?
[23:52:35] <coldhead> no
[23:52:48] <hanasaki> why is that?
[23:52:52] <coldhead> it might not feel there's an error if it's just some contentTYpe weirdness
[23:53:07] <coldhead> the error is more like if the JSON is invalid
[23:55:40] <hanasaki> I took out the data and contenttype since it's a get without any data to send... same issue
[23:56:30] <coldhead> guh, it looks okay to me
[23:56:31] <iSeeDeadPixels> how come this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/Q4WQ8/
[23:56:45] <Shai_Tan> iSeeDeadPixels: its broken
[23:56:48] <coldhead> can you get it online somewhere, hanasaki ?
[23:56:59] <hanasaki> coldhead:  javascript doesn't give much for debugging huh?
[23:57:07] <hanasaki> online?
[23:57:17] <iSeeDeadPixels> Shai_Tan: please look at it before saying such stuff
[23:57:44] <Shai_Tan> iSeeDeadPixels: Please give an error discription
[23:57:51] <iSeeDeadPixels> Shai_Tan: "nothing"
[23:57:55] <iSeeDeadPixels> it just doesn't work
[23:57:59] <Shai_Tan> iSeeDeadPixels: what goes in, what what comes out, what you expect
[23:58:01] <iSeeDeadPixels> no errors, no anything

[23:58:51] <hanasaki> coldhead:  its just on a dev box right now :(
[23:58:55] <hanasaki> way inside the firewall
[23:59:17] <hanasaki> coldhead:  any tips for debugging it?
[23:59:28] <coldhead> hanasaki: i would try running the ajax call from the console
[23:59:37] <coldhead> and change it a little bit at a time
[23:59:39] <hanasaki> how?
[23:59:42] <coldhead> until you see the problem
[23:59:47] <coldhead> in the Console of firebug
[23:59:49] <coldhead> or web inspecor
[23:59:53] <coldhead> just copy and paste
[23:59:55] <coldhead> and enter to rin
[23:59:57] <coldhead> run*
