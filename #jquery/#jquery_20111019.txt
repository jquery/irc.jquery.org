[00:00:02] <samrat> coldhead- :), I've been stuck on this since yesterday
[00:20:33] <coldhead> samrat: if you have .ajax('some url', function (aidsaidsaids) {...
[00:20:47] <coldhead> then you can access the returned data via that variable
[00:20:49] <coldhead> aidsaidsaids
[00:20:57] <coldhead> console.log(aidsaidsaids) is a good start
[00:22:50] <JKarsrud> logging aids again coldhead?
[00:23:09] <JKarsrud> long time no see btw :)
[00:23:12] <coldhead> it's who i am
[00:23:15] <coldhead> don't judge me
[00:23:31] <coldhead> apparently you've had better things to do than idle here lately, JKarsrud
[00:23:33] <coldhead> what gives?
[00:24:13] <JKarsrud> I've been idling here all the time, just not actively looking. Been busy with work is all
[00:24:18] <JKarsrud> way too much work even
[00:24:32] <coldhead> is the end in sight?
[00:26:26] <JKarsrud> nah, not really
[00:28:06] <coldhead> sigh
[00:28:17] <JKarsrud> but that's how it is working with clients
[00:28:26] <coldhead> bloody clients
[00:28:32] <coldhead> what have they ever done for us
[00:28:35] <coldhead> bah
[00:28:51] <JKarsrud> give us a shitload of money, but apart from that... nada :)
[00:29:47] <coldhead> WHAT?! I'VE BEEN DOING THIS STUFF FOR FREE!
[00:29:51] <coldhead> i'm such an idiot!
[00:36:27] <JKarsrud> :D
[00:44:17] <Nedlinpopo> anyonw here use handlebars?
[00:51:36] <Nedlinpopo> hello, is yehuda katz around here?
[00:51:49] <Nedlinpopo> i'm told he's a member of the core team
[00:52:53] <slavabulgakov> hi all! whether there is an analogue of the array, which can do: d = ['a', 'b', 'c']; d.remove('b'); result: ['a', 'c'] ?
[00:59:52] <ablomen> slavabulgakov, look at Array.splice() and Array.indexOf on the mdn
[01:01:18] <poppiez> I have a bunch of newlines in a div tag. how do I loop through each line?
[01:01:48] <slavabulgakov> ablomen: thanks!
[01:02:07] <Peeter> poppiez: You mean <br/>'s?
[01:02:23] <Nedlinpopo> poppiez: do you mean ascii LF or <BR> tags?
[01:03:06] <ablomen> poppiez, var i, lines = $("div").text().split("\n"); for (i = 0; i < lines.length; i += 1) { doSomethingWith(lines[i]); }
[01:03:27] <ablomen> or change text() to html() and \n to <br/> if you mean br's
[01:03:36] <poppiez> I mean \n's. ablomen's answer works perfectly. thank you so much!
[01:04:04] <CraXyOW3> Question: how can i execute a javascript even within a dialog button ?
[01:04:50] <Nedlinpopo> CraXyOW3: onclick property
[01:05:09] <Nedlinpopo> i.e. <button onclick=somefunction()>
[01:05:17] <CraXyOW3> onclick property within the dialoug button ?
[01:05:38] <coldhead> don't use onclick
[01:05:44] <coldhead> that's from last century
[01:05:48] <Nedlinpopo> depends on what you mean by dialog? you mean a modal window?
[01:05:51] <coldhead> use live
[01:05:53] <coldhead> ?live
[01:05:54] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[01:06:01] <CraXyOW3> yeah a modal window.
[01:06:06] <coldhead> and you can bind to elements that don't exist yet
[01:06:15] <Rich_Morin> The change event for input:text is deferred until the item loses focus. The keyup event isn't, but it looks like it will fire on (say) a shift key being released. Is there a good way to generate an event the first time the content of the field changes?
[01:08:31] <Hooloovoo> Rich_Morin: keyup and check which key is pressed maybe?
[01:09:00] <Hooloovoo> or check if the input value has changed after the keyup
[01:09:03] <kurtp> hey guys, having trouble on .sortable receive event, it seems the receive event is not triggered, here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/VeBev/7/ really appreciate your help
[01:09:06] <Rich_Morin> That looks like it would work; just hoping for something more direct
[01:09:26] <Hooloovoo> take the value on keydown, check if it differs on keyup, if it does you do your thang
[01:09:31] <CraXyOW3> thing is, that is a call for a custom web browser that handles ingame variables, there is an even that shows up a fitting window, this windows is called with a regular onclick or with href="javascript:" part.
[01:09:48] <CraXyOW3> it is that part i want to plement within the modal window.
[01:10:20] <CraXyOW3> i.e modal windows buttons "load fitting" "cancel"
[01:10:28] <Rich_Morin> Hooloovoo: hmmm; tnx
[01:10:36] <Deele> slavabulgakov you still need that f-tion?
[01:12:00] <slavabulgakov> Deele: no thanks! I did it  function remove(array, value) {
[01:12:00] <slavabulgakov>     array.splice(array.indexOf(value), 1);
[01:12:00] <slavabulgakov>   }
[01:12:18] <kurtp> receive event isn't triggered when I move an element from the #my-gadget to #products, any idea why it's not working? http://jsfiddle.net/VeBev/7/

[01:24:13] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[01:24:24] <k1t> does anyone know how i could get the text color black on the elements that get added dynamically with the "add another card" button on http://bluebellgiving.com/activate-redeem
[01:24:40] <k1t> the first elements are perfect, the text changes black when you click
[01:24:48] <k1t> but the dynamic ones are completely ignoring everything i do
[01:26:04] <kurtp> ?sortable
[01:26:06] <bot-t> kurtp, UI/API/1.8/Sortable - The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortable
[01:26:13] <k1t> anyone?
[01:26:15] <k1t> x;
[01:33:00] <aaronmcadam> k1t are you using $.fn.css?
[01:33:37] <k1t> aaronmcadam: jquery's native .css method? yeah, i believe so
[01:33:48] <k1t> 	$(this).css('color', 'grey');
[01:33:49] <k1t> yep
[01:34:45] <k1t> http://pastie.org/2722616
[01:34:47] <k1t> is what fails
[01:34:54] <coldhead> praise allah it's aaron to fix everything
[01:36:30] <Deele> hey, there was some guidelines doc, for good style of JS and jQ f-tion usage
[01:36:47] <k1t> aaronmcadam: is it because it's in document.ready? like it loads the doc, looks for the element on the document ready but since theyre dynamic theyre not being picked up?
[01:36:48] <k1t> or something?
[01:36:51] <k1t> idk dude its weird
[01:37:03] * k1t dropkick dynamic form elements
[01:37:22] <aaronmcadam> no if you requery the element it should pick it up
[01:37:36] <aaronmcadam> are you sure you're not storing a reference to the "old" element
[01:38:05] <k1t> well as a selector, im using a class that is applied to all of them
[01:38:13] <k1t> its just a selector, it should apply to all of them
[01:38:18] <k1t> especially since its a class
[01:38:40] <aaronmcadam> you'll have to make sure you're returning the css for each element itself
[01:39:08] <aaronmcadam> as in $( this ).css()
[01:39:30] <aaronmcadam> you'll need to make sure you're targeting the dynamic element
[01:39:34] <k1t> aaronmcadam: I do that, did you look at the pastie with that very code?
[01:39:42] <aaronmcadam> can you fiddle it instead
[01:39:42] <k1t> im a little smart than that my friend, i know how to use selectors
[01:39:45] <k1t> yes
[01:39:53] <aaronmcadam> heh
[01:40:02] <aaronmcadam> I didn't say u didn't
[01:40:15] <k1t> aaronmcadam: hehe
[01:40:18] <coldhead> i love you, aaronmcadam
[01:40:29] <coldhead> you're one of the good ones
[01:40:53] <aaronmcadam> coldhead respect your sensei ;)
[01:41:06] <coldhead> it is a respectful love
[01:41:09] <aaronmcadam> a JavaScript ninja should not know what it is to love

[01:42:31] <k1t> aaronmcadam: what is the URL to fiddle it?
[01:42:31] <coldhead> that is very beautiful and true, aaronmcadam. i must try to serve the DOM better

[02:16:34] <smurfke> hmm
[02:17:06] <NodeX> lol
[02:17:38] <Cagelin> juha_, you should use SHIFT instead. It keeps your muscles in your pinky in shape
[02:17:59] <juha_> Cagelin: thanks for the tip, that's how i will workout from now on
[02:18:03] <NodeX> I wonder if (people who talk when they read) SHOUT when they read CAPS
[02:18:11] <Cagelin> hahaha
[02:18:19] <Cagelin> Good point NodeX :p
[02:18:25] <NodeX> heh
[02:18:27] <NodeX> I know I do

[02:40:31] <Cros79> does anyone know how to prevent a select-element from going backwards and forwards on arrow-key events in Firefox?
[02:40:42] <Cros79> preventDefault doesn't seem to do anything
[02:43:39] <Serpico> is here a profi in jquery who can answer me 1-2 noob questions ?? :)
[02:44:31] <seutje> computer2000: don't think u can
[02:45:07] <azorai> Serpico, profi?
[02:45:51] <Serpico> how can i say,someone who know something more about jquery as I
[02:46:09] <azorai> Serpico, yes, ask your questions here :)
[02:46:28] <xec> i think the word it "professional"
[02:46:32] <xec> is*
[02:46:33] <Serpico> i have an jpg which i want to animate a little bit
[02:46:34] <the_real_crimper> profit
[02:46:38] <Serpico> yes xec
[02:46:53] <Serpico> i found this
[02:46:58] <Serpico> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[02:47:39] <xec> how exactly do you want to animate this image?
[02:47:45] <Hooloovoo> Serpico: that's how you animate, yup.
[02:47:49] <azorai> Fade it, move it? how?
[02:47:55] <Serpico> but there is only the way to animate with the button which run the animate, i want that the animate function begins when the browser load the page
[02:48:13] <Serpico> hope you understand =)
[02:48:19] <azorai> In that case you either want to bind to the window's 'load' event or the document's 'ready' event.
[02:48:31] <eddict> Serpico: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[02:48:35] <Serpico> yes i think thats right
[02:48:38] <azorai> E.g. $(document).ready(function() { /* ANIMATION CODE */ });
[02:49:36] <Serpico> sounds good, i will try
[02:49:47] <Serpico> and of course thanks for info ^^
[02:51:13] <Hooloovoo> or simply $(function() { //ANIMATION CODE })
[02:51:17] <Hooloovoo> shorter
[02:52:34] <azorai> If the animation occurs to early, you can delay it. See http://api.jquery.com/delay
[03:01:29] <Clorith> I'm trying ot stop a default event from triggering, due to IE I've got the ofllowing code; if (event.preventDefault) { event.pr... else { event.returnValue = false; }
[03:01:36] <Clorith> But this errors in FireFox
[03:01:51] <Clorith> Is there any fail safe way of preventing default events for mtriggering that DOES work in all browsers+
[03:02:41] <Aamir> ?preventdefault @Clorith
[03:02:42] <bot-t> Clorith, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[03:03:02] <Clorith> oh I see, I forgot to initialize the event xD
[03:05:57] <radiostar> ?jquery custom checkboxes
[03:06:01] <bot-t> radiostar, custom checkbox | jQuery Plugins - ScrewDefaultButtons allows you to easily replace the browser defaults for radio buttons and checkboxes with your own custom design. http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/custom-checkbox

[03:08:02] <ryan_sp> Is there anyway to sort an array of values like 18th February 2009, 25th September 2005 (by date) ?
[03:08:53] <timing> ryan_sp: create your own sort function and parse the date into a date object and sort the object
[03:09:46] <timing> ryan_sp: But I recommend sorting dates in SQL or PHP if you use this ofcourse :-)
[03:22:03] <Axsuul> what is the eventData for in.. click([eventData], handler(eventObject))
[03:23:22] <azorai> It's so you can specify data that'll eventually be passed to your handler when the event is triggered.
[03:24:59] <Axsuul> is there any way to have default eventData.. such as... click({'push': true}, function() { ... })
[03:25:07] <Axsuul> is there any way to have default eventData.. such as... click(data = {'push': true}, function() { ... })
[03:25:08] <Axsuul> i mean
[03:30:39] <AdTaylor> Is it possible in a requirejs module to load in another script based on browser tests (Modernizr)? In this kind of manner http://jsfiddle.net/AyBzH/
[03:31:41] <azorai> AdTaylor, have you tried it?
[03:31:46] <domcat> any good plugin or way for table column hover highlighting? (just full columns , no rows)
[03:32:26] <AdTaylor> azorai: yeah it pulls an error — didn't feel like I was on the right track at all
[03:34:48] <azorai> AdTaylow, I don't know if I can help, as I haven't used requireJS before. Is the require() call syncronous or async? If its the latter, then mob won't be defined... as the script has yet to load.
[03:36:27] <azorai> AdTaylor ^ (spelt name wrong)
[03:37:31] <AdTaylor> azorai: I think you right — it's definitely a definition issue but loading the script before the test would be counterproductive — looks like its time to dig into the source code a little deeper. Thanks for taking a look.
[03:37:36] <diggan> now I'm trying to add this content I have with $('#threadslist tbody tr:first').after(topThreadNewTags); and it works fine. I'm trying to add slideDown() before .after(topThreadNewTags) but it doesn't work. Any solution to this?
[03:37:36] <BleKohl> Is it possible to .unbind() an event on the page from Greasemonkey?
[03:37:42] <azorai> AdTaylor, isn't the normal requirejs format something like require(file, function(){ /* callback - its loaded */ });
[03:38:52] <azorai> BleKohl, only if you hav a reference to the original function that GM bound.
[03:39:21] <BleKohl> It's bound in the script inside the page ~_~
[03:40:13] <BleKohl> I want to remove the hover function
[03:41:17] <BleKohl> http://privatepaste.com/4bc2705490 <-- this is how it's defined inside the page script
[03:41:41] <BleKohl> $(".post.fade").unbind('mouseenter mouseleave'); <-- this works from the console, but not from greasemonkey
[03:41:52] <AdTaylor> azorai: yeah, but I was hoping to return the file/dependency to a variable.
[03:44:38] <diggan> now I'm trying to add this content I have with $('#threadslist tbody tr:first').after(topThreadNewTags); and it works fine. I'm trying to add slideDown() before .after(topThreadNewTags) but it doesn't work. Any solution to this?
[03:47:07] <azorai> diggan, animating <tr> elements is always tricky.
[03:47:15] <diggan> noticed that :p
[03:49:17] <azorai> I've heard that you can hack it by wrapping the <Tr> in a <div> and then animating the <div>...
[03:50:05] <azorai> Also, try explicit animation instead of slideDown/Up ... E.g. $(thing).animate({height:...}, callback...)
[03:55:47] <samrat> i've got a $.ajax success call: function(data){alert(data);}
[03:55:57] <samrat> and the data passed is {"message": "The video has been successfully queued for downloading"}
[03:56:05] <samrat> dataType is jsonp
[03:56:16] <johnline3> http://ajpiano.com/repeatingfirstgrade/summat_jovana.png
[03:56:24] <samrat> but in the alert I get "Object object"
[03:56:29] <samrat> why is that?
[03:57:46] <rook2pawn> does $("#foo span").val("bar") set the value of <div id="foo"><span>bar</span></div>
[03:57:52] <coldhead> wtf johnline3
[03:58:54] <azorai> samrat, because alert() will call OBJ.toString() which comes out as [object Object]. What are you expecting? Try console.log instead.
[03:59:28] <samrat> azorai- I need to display a message to the user.
[03:59:30] <azorai> rook2pawn, no use .text() instead of val()
[04:00:05] <azorai> samrat, then you want to reference the 'message' property. So something like `alert(data.message);`, right?
[04:00:14] <samrat> ah, okay
[04:00:28] <rook2pawn> azorai: does #foo span select the span inside the div with id foo?
[04:00:56] <azorai> Only if that div element (<div id="foo"...) is actually IN the document.
[04:01:06] <NodeX> quick plugin question to save me some time testing it... if you write a plugin that uses $(this) and $(this) doesnt exist yet (the plugin is responsible for creating it) will the plugin fail
[04:01:16] <coldhead> good work, azorai
[04:02:08] <azorai> NodeX, what do you mean by `$(this)` not existing? `$(this)` in a plugin returns a new jQuery object which wraps an element, i.e. `this`.
[04:02:40] <NodeX> $("#somediv").myPlugin() /.... $(this) is #somediv
[04:03:05] <samrat> azorai- I get undefined
[04:03:24] <NodeX> it's ok I'll go do the tests
[04:03:45] <BleKohl> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7820324/removing-event-handler-from-greasemonkey <-- anyone got any idea?
[04:04:02] <azorai> samrat, can we see all the relevant code? Please post to jsfiddle
[04:04:24] <solidus-river> is there a way to animate a text area from 1 row to 5 rows?
[04:04:28] <samrat> azorai http://jsfiddle.net/xs58h/
[04:05:27] <azorai> solidus-river, would be easier to animate its actual `height`. Like $('textarea').height(20).animate({height: 100});
[04:05:31] <samrat> the JSON is correct isn't it ? http://dpaste.com/637283/
[04:05:58] <samrat> *JSONP
[04:06:07] <NodeX> yup
[04:06:17] <rook2pawn> azorai: if i do a .append do you know if there is a way to do a callback on completion so i can select again what i appended?
[04:08:21] <azorai> samrat, the JSON looks correct. What do you get if you just console.log(data) -- what appears in the console (firebug, web inspector, whatever..)?
[04:08:49] <coldhead> ?g jsonlint @ samrat
[04:08:58] <coldhead> oh bot-t, i miss you
[04:09:44] <azorai> rook2pawn, It's much easier to select stuff out of the document, before appending it. E.g. var myDiv = $('<div id="foo">'); $('body').append(myDiv); // you can use the var `http://dpaste.com/637283/
[04:09:49] <samrat> azorai- I get "Object"
[04:09:56] <azorai> Ah crap, ignore that URL... whooops
[04:10:15] <samrat> coldhead- yeah, i did jsonlint and its valid, is json and jsonp the same?
[04:10:23] <azorai> samrat, what console are u using?
[04:10:35] <coldhead> yup, jsonp is just a fancy way of accessing json
[04:10:37] <samrat> azorai: chromium
[04:10:55] <samrat> it's a dropdown menu with some other data
[04:11:46] <samrat> azorai- there seems to be a warning too- Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type application/json.
[04:11:51] <rook2pawn> im trying to $("#main").append("<div id='foo'><span></span></div>"); then set the contents of the span
[04:12:12] <azorai> samrat, JSONP is the same as JSON BUT wrapped in a function call. Google it :)
[04:12:52] <samrat> azorai- jsonp's mime type is still "application/json" right?
[04:15:52] <azorai> samrat, nope, it should just be a regular script. JSONP isn't anything special like JSON. Really, it's just JavaScript that's loaded in via injecting a <Script> tag into the page -- this is why it works CROSS-domain. If you're asking jQuery to do a JSONP request u need to specify a callback like "foo" and then your server-side response must call that callback with the data passed as an argument. So the response should be: "foo({...JSON DATA...})"
[04:16:30] <samrat> azorai- so, when I pass a response, Content-Type should be application/javascript right?
[04:17:14] <azorai> Yep, I guess, but it doesn't reallly matter. It'll still be loaded I believe.
[04:17:15] <azorai> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2887209/what-are-the-differences-between-json-and-jsonp
[04:19:40] <rook2pawn> ah nm
[04:21:38] <azorai> rook2pawn, var div = $('<div id="foo"><span></span></div>'); $('#main').append(div); div.find('span').text('Whatever');
[04:24:24] <rook2pawn> yeah error in my selector, ty though
[04:24:48] <Axsuul> is there any way i can pass in default event data into an event?

[04:36:40] <diggan> is there anyway avoiding the webbrowser to freeze when using async: false?
[04:40:11] <ablomen> diggan, yes, not using async: false
[04:40:39] <ablomen> by it's very nature a synchronous http request locks op the browser
[04:41:04] <diggan> but if I use async: true, I get nothing as response
[04:41:11] <ablomen> diggan, use callbacks
[04:41:20] <diggan> ofcourse!
[04:41:20] <ablomen> see the documentation
[04:41:22] <diggan> thanks!
[04:43:07] <Axsuul> Anyone know how I can accomplish this? http://jsfiddle.net/ZVwRQ/1/
[04:43:25] <Axsuul> I want to pass in eventData via .trigger()
[04:43:29] <Axsuul> is that possible?
[04:44:11] <Axsuul> since eventData is passed in by binding an event, .click(eventData, f(e))
[04:44:19] <Axsuul> is there any way to pass in eventData by triggering the event?
[04:44:48] <Axsuul> or how can an event trigger communicate with its handler
[04:44:59] <ablomen> Axsuul, http://jsfiddle.net/ZVwRQ/3/
[04:45:05] <bart> how to change font-size of a particular dialog() [jqueryUi] ?
[04:45:07] <bart> only 1 dialog
[04:45:42] <ablomen> Axsuul, no need to put data in the event
[04:45:51] <Axsuul> ah thanks a lot
[04:46:28] <Axsuul> ablomen: well actually
[04:46:35] <Axsuul> i need it to trigger the click event somehow
[04:46:37] <Axsuul> and pass in the status
[04:47:03] <ablomen> Axsuul, no you should really only have to run the same code with different values
[04:47:58] <ablomen> Axsuul, anyway if you still want to, the docs have an example
[04:48:21] <ablomen> see the second example in http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[04:48:29] <Axsuul> thanks i think i got it

[04:50:36] <MarcelT3> hi, does somebody know how i could search/replace an unwanted unicode character with js?
[04:50:43] <ablomen> aaronmcadam, it should have a flag
[04:51:10] <ablomen> aaronmcadam, yeah make the first argument true
[04:51:43] <Bongs> can anyone help me solve an issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7817522/uncaught-typeerror-can-not-set-propery-function-name-of-undefined-for-widget/
[04:51:53] <aaronmcadam> aye
[04:52:55] <aaronmcadam> it's weird
[04:53:07] <aaronmcadam> my object is also getting the ajax callback data into it too
[04:54:39] <aaronmcadam> heh, the request is still working tho
[04:56:40] <diggan> I'm trying some ajax but I get nothing in response although I use success handler

[04:57:02] <lmatteis> i'm iterating over a jquery selection using .each()
[04:57:09] <lmatteis> is there a way to know when i'm on the last element of the iteration?
[04:57:24] <aaronmcadam> this is weird as fuck
[04:57:41] <lmatteis> or just compare the current index with the length of the selection array?
[04:57:52] <ablomen> diggan, https://www.flashback.org/nya-amnen << is your code on flashback.org too?
[04:57:52] <aaronmcadam> hahahah nevermind I'm an idiot
[04:58:07] <diggan> my code is run in Greasemonkey on that page
[04:58:24] <ablomen> oh greasemonkey..
[04:58:30] * ablomen runs away and hides
[04:58:33] <diggan> :)
[04:58:35] <MarcelT3> do you see the unicode char at all? i see it only with firefox. http://jsfiddle.net/Q6STe/ and another question: why does the replace not work?
[04:59:24] <diggan> I found this however: success: function() { /*code in here*/ } to put the code you want to activate when the request is finished.
[04:59:40] <diggan> but, success runs before request is finished
[05:00:38] <seutje> lmatteis: $foo.each(function() { if ($(this).is($foo.last()) { ... } }); ?
[05:01:11] <lmatteis> seutje: how about $foo.each(function(idx){ if(idx == ($foo.length-1)) ?
[05:01:58] <seutje> lmatteis: hmm, prolly better even

[05:12:49] <aaronmcadam> take that as a no then, bloody noobs ;) :D
[05:13:56] <Hooloovoo> aaronmcadam: have you?
[05:15:02] <aaronmcadam> hmm?
[05:15:29] <aaronmcadam> i want to call reject() on an ajax request but not trigger an actual error
[05:15:43] <aaronmcadam> If I could maybe pass something
[05:16:01] <aaronmcadam> ah yes
[05:16:02] <aaronmcadam> opts :D
[05:16:17] <aaronmcadam> yus! :D

[05:17:55] <bartek> Is there a way to improve this scenario? if (package.selected) { var $returnedHtml = $(data.html).appendTo(results).hide(); } else { var $returnedHtml = $(data.html).appendTo(results).hide(); }; // Basically, I wnat to hide the elements if package.selected is true, but if I do it afterwards, won't the HTML show up for a split second before being hidden? I don't want that
[05:18:27] <aaronmcadam> don't set variables in if statements bartek
[05:18:31] <aaronmcadam> *overwrite* them
[05:18:43] <aaronmcadam> as in don't use "var" set the variable above it
[05:18:53] <aaronmcadam> if statements do not give u scope
[05:19:02] <bartek> Ok, what about my question though?
[05:19:10] <aaronmcadam> still reading it
[05:19:13] <bartek> kk
[05:19:35] <aaronmcadam> hang on ur doing the same thing in both?
[05:19:40] <bartek> Kind of
[05:19:50] <aaronmcadam> looks like exactly the same
[05:19:51] <bartek> If package.selected, I want to hide all the elements right when I append them
[05:19:56] <bartek> Note the hide()
[05:20:03] <aaronmcadam> the hide is in both
[05:20:15] <bartek> Oh my typo in IRC, it should be in the first one
[05:20:24] <aaronmcadam> just don't append it or detach it
[05:20:42] <bartek> But .. I need to append it eventually
[05:21:11] <aaronmcadam> have you not tried it?
[05:21:19] <aaronmcadam> ?tias @ bartek
[05:21:29] <aaronmcadam> ?bot where the fuck are u
[05:23:31] <billcosb> bartek: do you want to hide the results element or its content?
[05:26:08] <aaronmcadam> billcosb: good point, you can have display:none on a containing element
[05:27:15] <billcosb> or use $(data.html).hide().appendTo(results) instead of $(data.html).appendTo(results).hide()
[05:27:20] <billcosb> to hide the content
[05:27:36] <aaronmcadam> yes
[05:34:58] <samrat> in jquery.ajax both success and error seems to get called http://jsfiddle.net/samrat/xs58h/1/ I get a Success message, then a parseerror

[05:36:29] <codecowboy> in a statment like $("a[rel^='prettyPhoto']").prettyPhoto({, how do I refer to the a tag within the prettyPhoto call? Hint - its not $(this).
[05:36:55] <codecowboy> i mean the <a> tag ^^
[05:38:18] <quicksilver> codecowboy: yes, because the parameter to prettyPhoto is just an object
[05:38:27] <quicksilver> that doesn't set up any scoping rules of it own.
[05:38:30] <quicksilver> just name it yourself.
[05:38:40] <quicksilver> var blah = $("a[rel^='prettyPhoto']");
[05:38:50] <quicksilver> blah.prettyPhoto({ ... refer to blah if you like ...});
[05:39:28] <quicksilver> hmm you probably have more than one matching that selector?
[05:39:39] <quicksilver> then use .each, which will set up 'this' for you
[05:40:24] <codecowboy> quicksilver: thanks. I think that is actually setting up pretty photo for every matching <a> tag on the page, though. I want to be able to access the href and title of each <a> tag in one of the prettyphoto options
[05:40:33] <quicksilver> yes.
[05:40:39] <quicksilver> hence my last couple of comments. Use .each ;)
[05:41:08] <codecowboy> quicksilver: ah, ok will try that.
[05:41:08] <quicksilver> $("a[rel^='prettyPhoto']").each(function() { $(this).prettyPhoto({ ... you can use 'this' in here ... }); });
[05:41:11] <codecowboy> thanks

[05:55:51] <dirkpennings> or should I use a for loop?
[05:56:08] <seutje> bartmax: that's just css o.O
[05:56:37] <seutje> bartmax: cycle (or any other slideshow plugin I know), doesn't handle the styling of the actual slides
[05:58:01] <bartmax> seutje: i was wondering of a caption, but nevermind, just did myself
[06:01:04] <seutje> bartmax: that's essentially the looks of your slide, it would be rude for a slideshow plugin to fiddle with this
[06:05:44] <bartmax> ok
[06:07:17] <aibo> hi, who can help me with this issue? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7821232/jquery-fancybox-issue-fancybox-jquery-event-does-not-see-html-content-which
[06:09:46] <samrat> both success and error seems to get called in this jquery.ajax call http://jsfiddle.net/samrat/xs58h/1/
[06:09:56] <samrat> any idea what's wrong?
[06:11:01] <skamikaze> aibo: you can do sth like that - http://pastie.org/2723754
[06:14:57] <aibo> skamikaze, thx, but it's so tricky
[06:15:15] <PHiZiX> i have a table with the first td in each row containing a grouped radio button. i would like the radio to be selected if the user clicks anywhere on the row. i've got that far, but the problem is that if the user changes their mind and clicks on a different row, the previous radio is stays selected. What's the best way to unselect the previously selected radio?
[06:15:16] <skamikaze> samrat: you do an $.ajax inside of $.getJSON
[06:15:29] <skamikaze> samrat: cleanup ur code ;)
[06:16:06] <skamikaze> aibo: if a live example what goes on there helps - pm me for the url
[06:16:20] <samrat> skamikaze: well, that is what I need to do, get data using getJSON and then send it to a server via a GET request
[06:17:03] <samrat> skamikaze- what could I do to clean it up?
[06:17:39] <skamikaze> samrat: success: function func(data) {
[06:18:22] <samrat> skamikaze- that is what I'm doing
[06:18:34] <samrat> you mean do that inside getJSON too?
[06:18:47] <skamikaze> samrat: success: function func(data) { should be : success: function( data ) { //..
[06:19:22] <samrat> skamikaze- func is the function name, that gets passed from server(as JSONP)
[06:22:25] <aibo> skamikaze, your code is nice but I want to understand what is the reason of such fancybox behavior, maybe it doesn't see new DOM content or what?
[06:22:50] <skamikaze> yes aibo
[06:23:54] <MacDada> hi, I use jQuery.serialize() to send forms via ajax and everything worked well until I changed <input type="text" /> to <input type="url" />. Is that a bug? How can I quickly serialize forms with html5 input types?
[06:24:01] <bartmax> something more 'beautifull' to clear the contents of a element instead of             $('#dialog').html('');
[06:24:10] <MacDada> serialize() ignores input type url
[06:24:42] <aibo> skamikaze, so I need to delegate a click action (which would change DOM tree by adding new image links) to my div?
[06:25:05] <skamikaze> aibo: yes :)
[06:25:15] <aibo> skamikaze, w8, I need to write some code :)
[06:26:07] <skamikaze> samrat: i didn't do much jsonp yet but i still think that line is wrong
[06:27:07] <samrat> skamikaze: well, the success part outputs right, so maybe the error part is wrong. Could someone please check?

[06:34:10] <skamikaze> aibo: got a live example maybe?
[06:34:14] <skamikaze> aibo: much easier then
[06:34:52] <aibo> skamikaze, nope, coz my content being loaded dynamically from local host database, and there is fancybox requirement, so I don't think it's possible to run it on fiddler
[06:35:04] <skamikaze> aibo: you don't delegate to anything
[06:35:09] <skamikaze> ?delegate @ aibo
[06:36:13] <skamikaze> mhm ok - no bot
[06:36:19] <skamikaze> you need to pass in a selector
[06:37:17] <aibo> that's correct ? `$('body').delegate('div#car_image', 'click', function(e) { `
[06:38:52] <aibo> skamikaze, i've checked with 'alert' and it's working when clicking
[06:39:09] <aibo> content being preloaded but still nothing with fancybox
[06:39:31] <skamikaze> what's the markup of that preloaded stuff dude?

[06:51:19] <azorai> mhotwagner, what class? jQuery is a class, I guess, but its objects (i.e. what u get when u call $()) are not classes -- they're just instances. I'm not sure what you mean by "objects of a given class" in this context.
[06:51:46] <skamikaze> aibo: image opens in seperate tab?
[06:52:30] <aibo> skamikaze, nope, same page like here: http://fancybox.net/
[06:52:38] <mhotwagner> Azorai, sorry, I mean an html class.  As in <img class='whatever'
[06:52:42] <mhotwagner>  />
[06:52:45] <aibo> skamikaze, 3 gallery images in bottom
[06:53:13] <skamikaze> aibo: if the image can't be loaded ..
[06:55:10] <azorai> mhotwagner, it's best to add it to the jQuery prototype then. There's currently no in-built way to specify methods per selection... So just do `jQuery.fn.myFunction = function(){...}`
[06:55:22] <aibo> skamikaze, $(this).attr('href') gives me 'undefined'
[06:55:31] <mhotwagner> Azorai, that'll do just fine.  Thanks!
[06:55:46] <ScottO_> file fields fail, theres no way to select 'no file'
[06:56:07] <ScottO_> so fi validation fails once, then im stuck either reloading the page, or using another file
[06:57:03] <ScottO_> damn webkit...
[06:57:13] <skamikaze> aibo: set breakpoints then, check elements on traversing
[06:57:38] <skamikaze> aibo: or pass a selector ('a') to prevAll/nextAll
[06:58:16] <ScottO_> how do you select no file
[06:59:55] <r0bot> hi all can you tell me why this code is not delaying the application of class elements
[06:59:56] <r0bot> function Insert() { $.ajax({    type: "POST",    url: "CustomSearch/insert.php",    data: "name=" + document.getElementById('name').value.toString(),    success: function(data){      $('#displaywide').html(data); 	 $('#photocontainer').delay(1800).attr('class' , 'hidden_elem' ); 	 $('#widedisplay').delay(1800).attr('class' , 'hidden_elem' ).delay(1800);     }});    }
[07:00:03] <r0bot> it works perfectly
[07:00:07] <r0bot> it just
[07:00:16] <r0bot> applies hidden_element class
[07:00:25] <r0bot> instatly upon finishing the ajax call
[07:00:58] <r0bot> function Insert() { $.ajax({    type: "POST",    url: "CustomSearch/insert.php",    data: "name=" + document.getElementById('name').value.toString(),    success: function(data){      $('#displaywide').html(data); 	 $('#photocontainer').delay(1800).attr('class' , 'hidden_elem'); 	 $('#widedisplay').delay(1800).attr('class' , 'hidden_elem');     }});    }
[07:01:04] <r0bot> mistake in the code uo
[07:01:09] <r0bot> anyone ?
[07:01:46] <johnernaut> r0bot please post your code in jsfiddle to make it easier to read..
[07:02:42] <r0bot> http://jsfiddle.net/cE5NK/
[07:02:46] <xec> .delay() will not delay the execution of the chain
[07:02:47] <r0bot> here it is
[07:02:58] <r0bot> any ideas on how to delay it ?
[07:03:12] <xec> setTimeout ?
[07:03:12] <adrianp> setTimeout
[07:03:46] <ScottO_> ahah
[07:03:46] <adrianp> why are you delaying?
[07:04:00] <ScottO_> nice, the value of the file select is "C:\fakepath\import.txt"
[07:04:13] <ScottO_> interesting that the browser adds C:\fakepath\ in there
[07:04:19] <ScottO_> security reasons?
[07:04:25] <Serpico> hi again .......... http://api.jquery.com/animate/   - i had try this first time .... i try to animate a div with an background image - it works - but not in the way i want - now it animate the div(image) to a small line - but i want it from an small line to the full image to animate
[07:05:24] <xec> Serpico: show us your code? what have you tried so far?
[07:05:33] <Serpico> <div id="animate"><script>
[07:05:33] <Serpico>   $(document).ready(function() {
[07:05:33] <Serpico>   $("#animate").animate({
[07:05:33] <Serpico>     width: "1px",
[07:05:33] <Serpico>     opacity: 0.4,
[07:05:33] <Serpico>        }, 1500 );
[07:05:33] <Serpico> });
[07:05:34] <Serpico> </script></div>
[07:05:49] <johnernaut> .........
[07:05:51] <xec> Serpico: i meant in a pastebin, like jsfiddle :P
[07:05:54] <Aquaguy> Serpico, pastebin/jsfiddle is your friend
[07:06:25] <xec> Serpico: why do you have the script code inside the div
[07:06:59] <Serpico> as i say, i try to learn, and at the moment....... iam a noob =)
[07:07:15] <xec> and where does your ready event end, seems youre missing a set of }); at the end
[07:07:37] <Serpico> really ?
[07:07:40] <xec> no nevermind
[07:07:56] <Aquaguy> Serpico, you should use chrome/safari and check the console, or firefox+firebug
[07:07:58] <mhotwagner> He's right, though, stick that up in your header
[07:08:00] <xec> i was expecting one after animate
[07:08:05] <Serpico> animate works
[07:08:08] <Aquaguy> It's the best way to learn
[07:08:34] <Serpico> but not in the way i want
[07:08:41] <mhotwagner> what do you want it to do?
[07:08:58] <Serpico> mom search for the word in english =)
[07:09:43] <mhotwagner> Serpico, what is it doing now that you don't want/what DO you want?
[07:09:44] <nouri> How is it possible that the jquery.form plugin that I included in my page set $.fn.ajaxSubmit but $.ajaxSubmit still isn't defined?
[07:10:02] <xec> ooh, but there is an extra comma after opacity!
[07:10:05] <Serpico> it should be vice versa
[07:10:05] <Aquaguy> Hey guys is there any event that is triggered when you click and hold the button apart from the 'click' event?
[07:10:20] <quicksilver> nouri: $.fn. is different from $. ?
[07:10:27] <Serpico> now it beginn with the big image and animate it to a small line 1 px
[07:10:30] <quicksilver> nouri: $.fn. is the stuff which goes onto jQuery objects
[07:10:42] <Serpico> and it should be vice versa
[07:10:43] <nouri> quicksilver: duh
[07:11:07] <xec> Serpico: you specify what you want to animate *to* - so set the starting point in css file and the end result in animate properties
[07:11:21] <Aquaguy> nouri, that you should call $('#foo').ajaxSubmit
[07:12:14] <Serpico> i think i have thinking errors =)
[07:12:39] <nouri> quicksilver, Aquaguy: thanks for pointing out what should be obvious
[07:12:42] <xec> Serpico: http://jsfiddle.net/xmmzc/
[07:12:45] <mhotwagner> Aquaguy, not as I understand, but you could test for it at at intervals by setting a boolean to true every time the mouse is clicked, and false every time it is released
[07:12:46] <Aquaguy> nouri $.ajaxSubmit = function( params ) { }
[07:13:22] <Aquaguy> you should define your plugin that way if you want it to work with $.ajaxSubmit();
[07:13:53] <Aquaguy> nouri, then thank you for your clear and straight forward question. ;)
[07:14:14] <mhotwagner> Aquaguy, so $(document).mousedown = function() mouseIsDown = true; $(document).mouseup = function() mouseIsDown = false
[07:14:37] <mhotwagner> Aquaguy, and then whenever you need to test it, it's just  if (mouseIsDown) doSomething();
[07:14:51] <Aquaguy> mhotwagner, thank you, is to change the classname of the helper of a draggable element
[07:15:35] <Aquaguy> when you keydown the 'shift' key
[07:17:00] <Serpico> thx xec , i know now what my thinking error is and now it works ^^
[07:17:25] <xec> yw :)
[07:17:58] <mhotwagner> Aquaguy, not sure what the shift keycode is, but   $(document).keydown(function(e) { if (e.keyCode == 'SHIFTKEYCODE') $('#someElement').attr('class','new_class') });
[07:19:37] <jschoolcraft> How do I modify the contents of a cloned DOM bits.  https://gist.github.com/0ea8532acf8f217ec6ef is my attempt, but it's not replacing things as I expected them too.
[07:19:57] <ScottO_> if i have multiple elements in the selector, will it perform the callback on the current field? or all of the one sin the selector?
[07:20:58] <Aquaguy> mhotwagner, e.shiftKey should return true if it's pressed so, that part is easier, and I just found that there is a drag event inside the draggable object so I can modify the helper's class without much effort. Thank you for your help!!
[07:21:49] <mhotwagner> Hah, well, that makes it easier ... I have a tendency to take the long way around...
[07:26:14] <Ruum> hello guys
[07:26:30] <Ruum> right now I am having this css problem: http://jsfiddle.net/bPu4U/1/
[07:27:09] <Ruum> as you can see, the red text is not all on one line... and I need that to happen :-(
[07:27:19] <diamonds> how can I change the :hover style of an element with jquery?
[07:27:37] <diamonds> I tried $('.foo:hover').css('background','red'); but it worked not
[07:27:53] <jexmex> http://pastie.org/2724141
[07:28:01] <jexmex> I get document.ready is not a function
[07:28:10] <adv_> anyone knows how i can execute a perl script from jquery? i want to run it like ./script.pl arg1 arg2 . i have already the arg1 and arg2 values retrieved with jquery
[07:28:35] <adrianp> adv_: $.get / $.post
[07:28:39] <diamonds> adv_: browsers can't run perl scripts (mostly)
[07:28:45] <adrianp> your perl script should be able to read that data
[07:28:46] <diamonds> what he said
[07:28:56] <fakingfantastic> is there a way to ensure bind order for events?
[07:28:58] <mhotwagner> adv_ use soemthing serverside ... like php
[07:29:06] <adrianp> but yeah, you need to configure your browser to exec perl scripts
[07:29:15] <fakingfantastic> Like, ensure certain submit() bind code gets run before any other?
[07:29:20] <adrianp> mhotwagner's is easier
[07:29:35] <adv_> adrianp, no, i want to execute the perl script on the web server environment, not on the client side
[07:29:56] <adv_> adrianp, doesnt that introduce overhead?
[07:30:02] <aniasis|karega> any good javascript podcasts and web design podcasts?
[07:30:13] <adrianp> adv_: right, which is why you have to use a server side technology such as PHP's system() function or configure apache's ExecCGI
[07:30:37] <adv_> adrianp, so i can't execute it with .get/.post?
[07:30:53] <adrianp> you can if you have a server side script that executes ur .pl script
[07:31:08] <rosieres> ruum: http://jsfiddle.net/bPu4U/2/
[07:31:19] <adv_> adrianp, like php system() you mean?
[07:31:20] <adrianp> $.get(...,url: "cgi-bin/script.pl",data: {})
[07:31:27] <adrianp> or that
[07:31:27] <adv_> ah yes
[07:31:50] <adv_> adrianp, and how do i get the returned data back in jquery?
[07:31:52] <adrianp> probably best to leverage PHP and avoid configuring cgi-bin unless you need to
[07:32:06] <adrianp> adv_: docs.jquery.com/get
[07:32:19] <adrianp> get has a callback function you can use to manipulate data coming back
[07:33:14] <adrianp> just be careful and sanitize input that is being passed to your .pl file
[07:33:25] <adv_> should i have the form action to post to process.php or call php from jquery and have action="#" in the html?
[07:33:45] <adv_> adrianp, yes i wanted to ask that as well. how can i do this?
[07:33:56] <adrianp> sanitize input? only you know this
[07:35:07] <adv_> adrianp, should i sanitize on the client or the perl side?
[07:35:22] <adrianp> make sure (using regex/int(), whatever) that the data is what you expect it to be
[07:35:47] <adrianp> adv_: sanitize on the client side for the user's sake, make it more friendly
[07:35:54] <adrianp> but you must sanitize on the server side as well
[07:36:14] <adv_> adrianp, hm good advice
[07:36:24] <adv_> should i have the form action to post to process.php or call php from jquery and have action="#" in the html?
[07:36:27] <NodeX> can anyone see anyting immediately wrong with: $("#chat-with").append('<li>new stuff</li>').attr({ scrollTop: ( $(this).prop("scrollHeight") + 100) }); ...... It doesnt scroll the div down to the bottom and it's getting on my nerves
[07:36:52] <Ruum> rosieres: thanks that was a big help - but now the text is in reverse order and the ' | ' is all wrong.
[07:37:02] <adrianp> adv_: depends on what you're doing, $.get/post is a way to perform ajax calls to urls without reloading the browser
[07:37:22] <adrianp> form posting will navigate away
[07:37:26] <adrianp> see documentation and examples
[07:38:08] <rosieres> Ruum: http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_float.asp
[07:39:37] <adv_> adrianp, my arg1 and arg2 to the perl script will be the contents of the textfield1 and textfield2 of a html form. my usual approach is posting to process.php and transfer control there. so you're saying i should have <form class="form1" action="#" method="get">, read the of the textfields from jquery and then call the php script with .get ?
[07:42:53] <Ruum> rosieres: thanks I looked at that, I tried clear and I tried float - the closest I can come to getting this correct is here: http://jsfiddle.net/bPu4U/3/ but again, I need the whole red text shifted over to the right, while looking exactly like that.
[07:45:34] <rosieres> Ruum: that cant be that difficult . . . . http://jsfiddle.net/bPu4U/4/
[07:46:32] <Ruum> rosieres: THANKS your a lifesaver!!!
[07:48:12] <MagBo> hi gentlemen. has someone ever experienced troubles with jquery form plugin sending data over non-standard port (!= 80)?
[07:51:19] <FNTom> MagBo: Are you trying to AJAX get / post to a non 80 port from a site running on port 80/
[07:52:02] <adv_> adrianp, help?
[07:52:23] <adv_> adrianp, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ 1st example of that url?
[07:57:09] <cody--> how can i destroy a trigger I create?
[07:58:06] <mhotwagner> unbind
[08:00:19] <MagBo> FNTom: I don't understand what's site running at a port tbh. I have a http server that is running on port 6670
[08:01:25] <MagBo> the whole page is kinda served by that server being fetched from url say "http://example.com:6670"
[08:01:44] <cody--> ah ty
[08:02:27] <MagBo> I want to make an AJAX POST to the very same server running on 6670
[08:04:39] <MagBo> FNTom: am I explaining myself? xD
[08:06:50] <adv_> http://pastebin.com/EUm3hj0f , anyone can help me with this code? when i push on the search button, the suggestion window goes away ( $('.autocomplete').fadeOut(500); ) , but when i press enter it stays on. how can i make the enter button behave like the click on the search button?
[08:07:26] <rosieres> MagBo: I think youll need a reverse proxy to get this done without breaking security rules ;-)
[08:08:05] <MagBo> rosieres: okay. frustration.
[08:08:14] <rosieres> MagBo: read this . . . .  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2099728/how-do-i-send-an-ajax-request-on-a-different-port-with-jquery
[08:09:27] <bgy> is it possible to use a selector with multiple context? like $('li', '#first, #second') ?
[08:10:04] <MagBo> rosieres: thanks. btw, I can't see what's the problem with sending POST stuff to a custom port
[08:10:35] <MagBo> I mean, that's just a HTTP stuff over TCP/IP, where's the security problem?
[08:12:14] <MagBo> the cross-domain thing is kinda obvious, but queries to the same server (both physical and software-wise) which served html seconds ago seem legit xD
[08:14:52] <rosieres> MagBo: Thats a philosphical question . . .  The same orgin policy sais it :  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript . . . reason can be to decrease the number of volunerabilities . . .
[08:16:10] <adv_> anyone?
[08:16:33] <mhotwagner> yes?
[08:16:43] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/md7Ae/ my position: fixed is flickering when i scroll, I think it's jogging between static/fixed . Can someone take a look and offer a suggestion?
[08:17:13] <mhotwagner> momento
[08:17:18] <MagBo> rosieres: okay, and why can't I send AJAX Post to port 81 in case of http://store.company.com:81/dir/etc.html origin?
[08:17:37] <MagBo> just can't grasp the point of that stuff ;<
[08:19:41] <mhotwagner> adv_, you can simulate the form click when the enter button is pressed with something like this (psuedo code, mind you):
[08:20:40] <mhotwagner> adv_, $('#theform').bind('keypress' function(e) { if (e.keyCode == 13) $('#submitButton').click() });
[08:20:52] <mhotwagner> adv_, make sense?
[08:21:13] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/md7Ae/ my position: fixed is flickering when i scroll, I think it's jogging between static/fixed . Can someone take a look and offer a suggestion?
[08:21:55] <adv_> mhotwagner, yes but where should i put it? at which point?
[08:23:14] <adv_> mhotwagner, and doesn't it need a ; after click() ?
[08:24:23] <mhotwagner> I mean, you could have one there.
[08:24:38] <mhotwagner> adv_, hangong, I'll throw some code up on JFiddle for you
[08:24:55] <mhotwagner> jSfiddle
[08:25:03] <FNTom> MagBo: Still here?
[08:28:08] <mhotwagner> adv_, here: http://jsfiddle.net/mhotwagner/xgcT4/

[08:30:02] <jeffsmykil> how do I use a + sign in a regular expression
[08:30:08] <jeffsmykil> like im looking for "+"

[08:30:15] <Haprog> \+
[08:30:18] <danzik17> jeffsmykil: \+
[08:30:55] <jeffsmykil> \+/g would find all +?
[08:31:49] <thyphus> jeffsmykil: /\+/g
[08:31:53] <adv_> mhotwagner, maybe because the other code brings it up again with ('.autocomplete').html(html).fadeIn(500);
[08:31:58] <MagBo> FNTom: y
[08:31:59] <adv_> how can i get over this?
[08:33:04] <mhotwagner> adv_, do you have the page live somewhere where I can take a look at it and your code?
[08:33:34] <MagBo> FNTom: feel free to answer my question[s] here, I can grep better than google ;< I'll be grateful if you clarify the situation and tell how can I work with daemon serving pages from a custom port w/o serverside shamanism

[08:35:13] <johnernaut> orolo: yes
[08:35:44] <orolo> johnernaut: ok. thanks
[08:35:46] <aaronmcadam> orolo: you can use firebug to see what data is being passed across
[08:36:38] <orolo> aaronmcadam: yeah, i see a Form Data parameter but it doesn't seem to be called 'myObject'

[08:36:56] <aaronmcadam> what *is* it called
[08:37:24] <orolo> no title, it just prints the members of the object. do i need to encode first?
[08:38:32] <orolo> also, there is no query string parameter for the object, is that the correct way?

[08:45:05] <adv_> mhotwagner, any ideas?
[08:45:40] <Fernandos> hii
[08:45:46] <Whirl3d> does $(".bgImage").width(w).height(h) define the width and height of all elements of class .bgImage?
[08:45:51] <mhotwagner> adv_, sorry, just a minute
[08:47:26] <Fernandos> I working on a product grid. Each product has an image,name and price, but I want to display descriptions,quantiy,dimensions and other attributes in a usable way without cluttering the product listing with useless info. Any ideas howto achieve that whilst beeing unobstrusive?
[08:48:02] <Fernandos> unobstrusivity is the hard part here.. I just wonder how the html should look like..
[08:48:10] <johnernaut> Fernandos: you could have some sort of fancy hover box that pops out when you hover over something
[08:48:19] <johnernaut> with that info
[08:49:24] <jeffsmykil> thypus i am having no luck with that regex for some reason
[08:49:38] <Fernandos> johnernaut: hmm but if you have 20products per page hovering over each would make them look to disruptive. At the moment my product listing looks similar to this  https://www.paypal-deutschland.de/shops/ I you don't see the orange badges then you need to refresh, b/c paypal is doing A/B testing
[08:49:39] <Whirl3d> Fernandos, look at http://www.balkhis.com/web-designs-resources/7-incredibly-beautiful-sliding-panel-with-jquery/
[08:51:01] <johnernaut> Fernandos: Hmm, I see.  I once did a Magento product listing where the product info was displayed as an overlay on the image once they hovered onto it
[08:51:10] <mhotwagner> adv_, almost there
[08:51:39] <Fernandos> johnernaut: yes that's default in this product listing and it looks disturbing
[08:51:49] <Fernandos> I'm just working on a full makeover
[08:51:56] <johnernaut> I see
[08:52:16] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/md7Ae/ my position: fixed is flickering when i scroll, I think it's jogging between static/fixed . Can someone take a look and offer a suggestion?
[08:52:51] <johnernaut> Fernandos: there's not really much room to put descriptive text there.  What if the image could slide up like a garage door and the info displays under it?
[08:54:04] <Fernandos> johnernaut: hehe yeah that's a cool idea, I've made a product search engine once that did exactly that, but evaluate it yourself and tell me if find it annoying or not.. hold on will post you the link
[08:54:12] <MagBo> FNTom: okay :3
[08:56:34] <Fernandos> johnernaut: this is what I made once, but I didn't like the UI that much it's a bit too playfull http://goo.gl/WxyoJ
[08:56:54] <mhotwagner> adv_, okay, so I added an id field to the html tags for both the submit button and the input box, and then stuck the following in $(document).ready(function() {
[08:57:21] <mhotwagner>   $('#inputBox').keypress(function(e) {
[08:57:22] <johnernaut> Fernandos: Hmm, the page doesn't load for me
[08:57:24] <Chuwiey> hi all, when using $("#id").click(function() {, can I use multiple #id's and then request to know which one based on which element the user clicked?
[08:57:34] <Fernandos> there is a search engine written in java entirely behind it (sorry didn't know enough c that time)
[08:57:40] <mhotwagner> adv_, sorry this:
[08:57:41] <rosieres> MagBo: Because Because . . .  dont ask me  . . .  to me it seems a bit silly too . . . could only say . . . because its a rule ;-)
[08:57:45] <mhotwagner> $('#inputBox').keypress(function(e) {
[08:57:45] <mhotwagner>   if (e.keyCode == 13) {
[08:57:45] <mhotwagner>     $('#submitButton').click();
[08:57:48] <mhotwagner>   }
[08:57:48] <mhotwagner> });
[08:58:00] <Fernandos> johnernaut: ? hmm try this http://goo.gl/hX01g
[08:58:03] <jkies00> hi all.  is there a significant performance hit when using a class name to get to a specific element?
[08:58:12] <johnernaut> Nope :(
[08:58:20] <johnernaut> I just see the logo and search bar
[08:58:28] <Fernandos> ahh :)
[08:58:28] <johnernaut> in Firefox and Safari
[08:58:29] <Fernandos> hahah
[08:58:30] <mhotwagner> adv_, and that works, per se ... the issue, however, is that you're updating the box with ajax, and so it keep reappearing
[08:58:36] <Fernandos> johnernaut: enter something
[08:58:42] <Fernandos> only electronic products though
[08:58:42] <MagBo> rosieres: SOP says "same hostname, protocol and port"
[08:58:45] <johnernaut> oh.. lol
[08:58:49] <jkies00> i have an app where button shave class attrs like "button green ok cancel-action"
[08:58:51] <stribor> is anyone familiar with limesurvey...i have little js problem
[08:59:09] <mhotwagner> adv_, so, while pressing enter calls the submit button's click handler, and does fade the box, it fades back in when new AJAX data is received
[08:59:11] <MagBo> okay, but I want to send ajax post over the same protocol to the same hostname on the same port
[08:59:12] <johnernaut> Fernandos: yeah, that effect is a bit annoying : /
[08:59:35] <mhotwagner> adv_, new idea, hang on
[08:59:36] <Chuwiey> When using a class to do an action on an event, can i then find out which #id the element had?
[08:59:41] <MagBo> so I really believe that it is possible and it's jquery form lib's fault
[08:59:42] <Fernandos> johnernaut:  now you see the idea is original but it's not really a good looking in reality
[08:59:52] <johnernaut> yeah
[08:59:53] <adv_> mhotwagner, yeah i realized this. how am i going to get around that?
[09:00:24] <Fernandos> johnernaut: do you know lightbox's behaviour, when you hover the left part of it it shows an arrow left and right part is shows an arrow right?
[09:00:32] <johnernaut> yeah
[09:00:47] <stribor> i am trying to prevent submit of happening when click on submit button happens or enter key was pressed but only click works....can anyone look at this code please....http://jsfiddle.net/HaqX6/
[09:00:47] <Chuwiey> For instnace: if i have a bunch of elements with a certain class but with different id's and I implement a click event function, can I then find out the id of the specific element that was clicked?
[09:00:52] <Fernandos> hmm any idea howto do that with jquery?
[09:01:06] <Fernandos> maybe it's too simple idk
[09:01:21] <johnernaut> have a div that only shows the 'arrow' image when you hover over it
[09:02:11] <Fernandos> lemme try
[09:03:14] <mhotwagner> adv_, booya, think I got it
[09:04:14] <ajpiano> Chuwiey: yes.  you can do this.id or event.target.id inside of the event handler
[09:05:10] <jeffsmykil> im having issues with this: http://pastebin.com/L9sWG928
[09:05:22] <mhotwagner> adv_, nope... I was hoping bluring the element would stop the box from updating... no luck
[09:05:29] <jeffsmykil> im getting this
[09:05:29] <jeffsmykil> TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'response.replace')
[09:05:41] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/md7Ae/ my position: fixed is flickering when i scroll, I think it's jogging between static/fixed . Can someone take a look and offer a suggestion?
[09:05:48] <adv_> mhotwagner, argh. and i thought it was going to be easy
[09:05:57] <Chuwiey> @ajpiano: will that return a string?
[09:06:04] <ajpiano> yes
[09:06:11] <JKarsrud> jeffsmykil: well
[09:06:11] <Chuwiey> @ajpiano: thanks.
[09:06:25] <JKarsrud> it just means that you're not getting the response then
[09:06:52] <jeffsmykil> JKarsrud: the function is returning a value
[09:07:20] <JKarsrud> does "response"contain a value tho
[09:07:25] <JKarsrud> ?
[09:07:37] <jeffsmykil> i guess i thought response would automatically contain the return from the function?
[09:08:06] <rosieres> falieson: without an working example nobody will help . . . . i guess. . .
[09:08:32] <jeffsmykil> JKarsrud: ^
[09:08:47] <mhotwagner> adv_, okay ... here's a shitty but workable solution: in addition to all the other stuff, add an id to the <ul class="autocomplete reset" ... />, and inside the keypress handler, add $('#autocompleteID').css('visibility','hidden')
[09:10:01] <Chuwiey> @ajpiano: can I reference this.id inside $(this.id).addClass...?
[09:10:14] <Chuwiey> @ajpiano: or do i have to dump it to a var first?
[09:10:15] <ajpiano> Chuwiey: $(this).addClass("whatever")
[09:10:27] <ajpiano> this is the dom element, you don't have to requery the dom by ID
[09:10:44] <MagBo> FNTom: query me, ok?
[09:10:55] <mhotwagner> adv_, problem is, the box won't reappear unless the page is reloaded
[09:10:55] <JKarsrud> jeffsmykil: does the $.getUrlVar return a promise?
[09:11:25] <jeffsmykil> oh JKarsrud  I might be a huge moron... It isn't an ajax call
[09:11:40] <Chuwiey> @ajpiano: thank you very much... :)
[09:12:07] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/md7Ae/ my position: fixed is flickering when i scroll, I think it's jogging between static/fixed . Can someone take a look and offer a suggestion? working example: http://fbookhire.me/index2.php rosieres
[09:12:13] <adv_> mhotwagner, yeah..not acceptable :/
[09:13:02] <JKarsrud> jeffsmykil: so it just returns a value? Or does it do some ajax magic itself, so you could just pass a callback in yourself?
[09:13:04] <adv_> maybe i can put 	if (response.suggestions.length) && keynotenter() ?
[09:13:10] <JKarsrud> to the getUrlVar method
[09:13:23] <jeffsmykil> JKarsrud: this was my original code but I wasnt getting a value back in time
[09:13:30] <ahandy> quick question. i have a box that has a counter inside, and is supposed to do some animations when hovered. when i update the counter using jquery/ajax and hover over it, the animations dont work :D only when i refresh the page does it work. can you gyus help out?
[09:13:41] <jeffsmykil> JKarsrud: just returns a value grabbed from the url
[09:13:47] <Gates> How do I write this jquery so its css default hidden, and when u scroll at the right time it show/hides?
[09:13:48] <Gates> http://pastebin.com/j9QpGXRy
[09:13:54] <JKarsrud> jeffsmykil: how does the function itself look?
[09:14:33] <JKarsrud> or could you paste more code? :)
[09:14:36] <jeffsmykil> JKarsrud: disclaimer I did not write this function
[09:14:37] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/dxZjyAcp
[09:14:42] <mhotwagner> adv_,  wait .... here's something
[09:15:12] <mhotwagner> adv_, attach a onFocus handler to the input box that brings the visibility of the box back ... so something like:
[09:15:42] <Gates> isnt it like if scroll is more than 200
[09:15:43] <Gates> or something
[09:15:47] <JKarsrud> jeffsmykil: yeah, that just returns a value, why can't you just play around with that value itself?
[09:15:48] <mhotwagner> adv,   $('#inputBox').focus(function() $('#autocompleteID').css('visibility','visible') );
[09:16:08] <mhotwagner> adv_, similiary, a blur handler that hides the box
[09:16:23] <falieson> Gates: haha, i'm trying to do something the same...
[09:16:25] <stribor> anyone familiar with limesurvey
[09:16:34] <Gates> some dude wrote it
[09:16:44] <Gates> and he made it so its not hidden and jquery hides it and toggles it
[09:16:49] <jeffsmykil> JKarsrud: that's what im trying to do with this : http://pastebin.com/uMB1Xiq2
[09:16:49] <falieson> Gates: look at my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/md7Ae/
[09:17:05] <falieson> The problem I am having is that my position: fixed is flickering when i scroll, I think it's jogging between static/fixed .  working example: http://fbookhire.me/index2.php rosieres
[09:17:15] <Gates> hmm falieson
[09:17:34] <Gates> too complex for what i need
[09:17:52] <falieson> Gates: you probably don't need the else statement that I added
[09:18:18] <falieson> Gates: but you just change the .css({display:' 'none'})
[09:18:19] <Gates> well when i rewrote - http://pastebin.com/j9QpGXRy - it seems to be even worse
[09:18:20] <Gates> so i went back
[09:18:28] <adv_> mhotwagner, feels like it's going to explode in my face but thanks!
[09:18:33] <Gates> falieson: isnt that what .hidden() does?
[09:18:35] <Gates> hide **
[09:18:39] <Gates> and display none are the same?
[09:18:42] <falieson> Gates: yeah, same thing really
[09:18:47] <Gates> problem is when i scrolled up it never hid again
[09:18:54] <SoulRaven> hi
[09:19:00] <SoulRaven> any news regarding "event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future."
[09:19:09] <falieson> right, that's what i have the else statement for me in my code
[09:19:16] <falieson> so that when it scrolls back up it reverts to how it was
[09:19:19] <falieson> you need the same
[09:19:32] <falieson> maybe... you don't have an if, and I do so not sure
[09:19:38] <mhotwagner> adv_, haha, yeah, at this point it's just workarounds ontop of one another ... there's a probably a simpler way to do it .... but that's what I came up with
[09:20:13] <ahandy> is there a reason why jquery animations stop working after i use .html()?
[09:20:36] <SoulRaven> is any workaround for event.layerX ....layerX?
[09:20:42] <adv_> mhotwagner, with the same code i have another problem, i'm trying to post the form's textfields to a process.php . i'm trying to use http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#getting-started, but it doesn't work . why?
[09:21:07] <adv_> the .php file is never reached

[09:21:46] <jeffsmykil> JKarsrud: I mistook an uppercase I for a lowercase I
[09:21:51] * jeffsmykil smacks himself
[09:22:14] <NodeX> Can anyone see anything immediately wrong with this ...
[09:22:16] <NodeX> $("#chat-with").append('<li>new stuff</li>').attr({ scrollTop: ( $(this).prop("scrollHeight") + 100) });
[09:22:17] <solepixel> anyone used a pagination library that changes the URL based on page? like mysite.com/pagination/#page-3 something like that?
[09:22:17] <NodeX> Can anyone see anything immediately wrong with this ...
[09:22:20] <NodeX> oops
[09:22:23] <NodeX> It's driving me up the wall that it wont scroll the element to the bottom - it's about 14px shy (orr the amount I just added ) shy
[09:23:49] <justsomedood> NodeX : Have you tried changing the scroll separately, after doing the append?
[09:24:04] <NodeX> yer same,.,,
[09:24:15] <morphine> Anybody here recently used the jquery.hotkeys plugin? It's not really working as it should at all.
[09:24:18] <NodeX> I thought that in the first instance
[09:24:20] <Gates> it wont rehide
[09:24:23] <Gates> i cant figure out why
[09:25:02] <NodeX> it goes down then up which is weird
[09:25:21] <Gates> is $($el) correct?
[09:25:23] <Gates> if $el is defined
[09:25:40] <NodeX> ?demo @ gates

[09:25:43] <JKarsrud> jeffsmykil: hah, no worries, that can happen to anyone :D
[09:25:54] <Gates> hmm
[09:25:56] <jeffsmykil> it happens to me a loooot :)
[09:26:00] <jeffsmykil> thanks for your help JKarsrud
[09:26:04] <Gates> NodeX: the orignial http://pastebin.com/j9QpGXRy
[09:26:07] <Gates> the rewrite is ..
[09:26:22] <JKarsrud> jeffsmykil: no worries. Maybe switch to a font where I's and l's are different? :)
[09:26:39] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/P3a7p/
[09:26:47] <Gates> ^thats the rewrite that hide and never shows again
[09:27:02] <NodeX> timing out for me
[09:27:02] <falieson> http://fbookhire.me/index2.php can someone tell me why my nav is flickering? fiddle -> http://jsfiddle.net/md7Ae/
[09:27:12] <jeffsmykil> JKarsrud: it was the browser location bar
[09:27:13] <justsomedood> NodeX : is the height of the scroll box 100?  Wouldn't you mean scrollHeight - 100?
[09:27:20] <JKarsrud> jeffsmykil: oh right :D
[09:27:21] <JKarsrud> haha
[09:27:39] <NodeX> justsomedood : I tried it with negative and non negative ..
[09:28:41] <NodeX> it's parent is a fixed position which I think is what's causing it
[09:29:28] <NodeX> It's been driving me mad all afternoon lol
[09:29:31] <justsomedood> I think you're wanting something like:  scrollTop = scrollHeight - clientHeight
[09:29:45] <justsomedood> (if you want it at the bottom)
[09:30:02] <NodeX> it's not a div as such it's a facebook (old) style chat box
[09:30:08] <adv_> anyone?
[09:30:42] <NodeX> justsomedood : either way scrollHeight - 10000 should work and it doesnt
[09:31:00] <justsomedood> NodeX: it shouldn't, that would be a negative number
[09:31:11] <justsomedood> have you tried setting the value manually to see if it moves?
[09:31:14] <NodeX> good point ..
[09:31:20] <NodeX> I tried + / - 14
[09:31:32] <NodeX> ** scrollHeight - 14 && scrollHeight + 14
[09:31:34] <ajpiano> NodeX: are you sure you're actually getting the scrollHeight of the right element? like... what is the 'this' who's scrollHeight you're reading?
[09:31:43] <NodeX> ajpiano : yes
[09:31:48] <Gates> necolas
[09:31:50] <Gates> hmm
[09:31:50] <NodeX> it does it but not all the way
[09:31:55] <Gates> NodeX: maybe im crazy
[09:32:03] <Gates> but cant u just merge the jquery into the other one?
[09:32:03] <Gates> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1359535
[09:32:15] <Gates> if it does the same type of action
[09:32:19] <NodeX> it's the exact amount less than I just added @ ajpiano
[09:32:42] <NodeX> ... $("#chat-with-<?php echo($with); ?>").append('<li><?php echo($content); ?></li>').prop({ scrollTop: ( $(this).prop("scrollHeight") - $(this).height()) });
[09:32:54] <SoulRaven> is any workaround for event.layerX ....layerX, because in webkit will be deprecated
[09:33:15] <Gates> womp
[09:33:27] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: http://jqbug.com/10531
[09:33:53] <justsomedood> NodeX: Try setting the scrollTop to the scrollHeight

[09:34:18] <NodeX> justsomedood : tried
[09:34:40] <justsomedood> NodeX:  Try setting the position to relative then and see if it makes a differnce - i don't see why it would but might as well check
[09:34:42] <SoulRaven> i will try. thx
[09:34:42] <NodeX> I seldom have jquery/javascript I cannot solve but this one is driving me mad
[09:34:53] <NodeX> justsomedood : tried lol
[09:35:02] <NodeX> relative and non relative

[09:35:13] <justsomedood> NodeX:  it seems to work fine for this:  Does anybody know what the jquery.com homepage uses for the mouseover menus on "Lightweight Footprint" , "CSS3 Compliant"
[09:35:20] <justsomedood> NodeX: this i mean
[09:35:28] <justsomedood> http://radio.javaranch.com/pascarello/2005/12/14/1134573598403.html
[09:35:28] <NodeX> it's 14 px off
[09:35:52] <ajpiano> NodeX: try using outerHeight instead of height() ?
[09:35:55] <justsomedood> Does anybody know what the jquery.com homepage uses for the mouseover menus on "Lightweight Footprint" , "CSS3 Compliant" and "Cross-crowser"
[09:36:02] <stribor> is there any way that name of the event can be printed to alert box
[09:36:12] <ajpiano> alert( event.type );
[09:36:29] * NodeX kisses justsomedood
[09:36:34] <NodeX> omg lol
[09:36:41] <adv_> is there a way that i can do this http://malsup.com/jquery/form in the background?
[09:36:44] * NodeX now wonders why jquery could not do that
[09:36:55] <ravenzz> isn't $(this) #chatwith in this scenario?
[09:37:04] <samrat> any tutorials which help me to use modal boxes with bookmarklets?
[09:37:05] <rosieres> falieson: its flickering because of that you have guessed .... a switch between static and fixed . . .
[09:37:06] <stribor> ajpiano: thank you
[09:37:15] <ravenzz> doesn't matter if you append foo
[09:37:19] <NodeX> var objDiv = document.getElementById("chat-with-<?php echo($with); ?>"); objDiv.scrollTop = objDiv.scrollHeight; <---- works
[09:37:43] <NodeX> $("#chat-with-<?php echo($with); ?>").append('<li><?php echo($content); ?></li>').prop({ scrollTop: ( $(this).prop("scrollHeight")) });
[09:37:43] <NodeX>  <---- doesnt
[09:37:50] <lxg> hi ... using $.ajax(), how can i retrieve a json object from a remote server?
[09:37:52] <NodeX> strange lol
[09:37:53] <lxg> i use jsonp
[09:37:54] <necolas> Gates: ?
[09:38:08] <ravenzz> NodeX do you need to scroll till the #chatwith bottom?
[09:38:13] <lxg> but the server can only return a normal json object
[09:38:13] <ajpiano> justsomedood: it just is jquery.fn.hover http://static.jquery.com/files/rocker/scripts/custom.js
[09:38:15] <Gates> necolas: yes?
[09:38:22] <Gates> what
[09:38:23] <ajpiano> NodeX: what makes you think that 'this' is the div
[09:38:24] <NodeX> ravenzz : yes
[09:38:26] <lxg> without the callback stuff which would be required for jsonp
[09:38:42] <lxg> is this something i can handle with dataType?
[09:38:47] <NodeX> ajpiano : whty is it not ?
[09:38:56] <NodeX> dont tell me it's the fricken <li> I updateds
[09:38:59] <lxg> i tried dataType : 'jsonp text json'
[09:39:03] <lxg> but this doesn't work
[09:39:04] <ajpiano> it's probably the window or something else you don't expect
[09:39:07] <Gates> Do I really need both, cant i just make it one? http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1359535
[09:39:12] <Gates> or maybe i have the wrong part showing
[09:39:14] <ajpiano> NodeX: there isn't a magical 'this' scope when you don't enter a new function
[09:39:15] <NodeX> after "append()"
[09:39:20] <lxg> any ideas?
[09:39:22] <justsomedood> ajpiano: I don't see that in the source though
[09:39:27] <ajpiano> NodeX: for instance $("#foo").attr("foo", $(this).attr("bar")) doesn't work
[09:39:42] <NodeX> in animate() .. I'm sure that this is always the current selector
[09:39:48] <ajpiano> justsomedood: http://static.jquery.com/files/rocker/scripts/custom.js look for the string "checkpoint"
[09:39:56] <ajpiano> NodeX: no it isn't
[09:39:58] <NodeX> $("#foo").anmimate()
[09:40:00] <NodeX> oops
[09:40:08] <ajpiano> in the *callback* it is
[09:40:12] <NodeX> brain fart today then .. to much vodka last night :(

[09:40:29] <ajpiano> but not if you're just doing $("#foo").animate({foo: $(this).attr("bar") });
[09:40:31] <justsomedood> ajpiano: Ahhhhh, duh ok!  Thanks!
[09:40:37] <ravenzz> well Indeed you should call scrollTop to the window element
[09:40:50] <ajpiano> NodeX: luckily for us it's actually possible to debug and find out what 'this' is
[09:41:35] <NodeX> I've been writing in 4 different languages today and my brain got all messed up when I went back to js lol
[09:41:50] <NodeX> I can't believe I made a rookie mistake lol
[09:42:08] <NodeX> thanks for help guys :)
[09:42:14] <ajpiano> that's why it's always good to like, debug first... ask questions later :)
[09:42:16] <Gates> necolas: i didnt mean to
[09:42:33] <Gates> falieson: yep no idea
[09:42:47] <NodeX> ajpiano : probably but I'm lazy
[09:42:49] <NodeX> lol
[09:43:08] <ajpiano> lazy people don't get to save face :)
[09:43:43] <falieson> rosieres: well the reason i guessed that is because when I inspect element and scroll the "fixed" goes away :-P
[09:44:02] <NodeX> I aint worried about face .. I make enough money to not care and dont have a problem admitting I was wrong :)
[09:45:19] <ajpiano> ...
[09:45:29] * ajpiano makes a mental note
[09:45:54] <NodeX> heh
[09:45:55] <falieson> ok, so if I remove the else statement it doesn't flicker.. so the else statement was causing it... but how do I have it stop being fixed at the top when I scroll back up to the top?
[09:45:56] <ajpiano> the implicit contract of getting support on IRC is that you yourself have actually tried to solve the problem.
[09:46:09] <ajpiano> using all the tools at your disposal
[09:46:19] <stribor> ajpiano: why does this not detecting "enter" key submit http://jsfiddle.net/HaqX6/4/
[09:46:21] <ajpiano> it's one thing if you don't know how to debug... it's another if you just don't debug.
[09:46:27] <ravenzz> bazooka included
[09:46:48] <stribor> ajpiano: when i click on button it printss "submit"......when i click enter key it doesnt
[09:46:56] <NodeX> I could be arrogant and say I dont know how because my code works first everytime but I wont :P
[09:47:04] <NodeX> and it would be a lie!
[09:47:16] <ajpiano> stribor: i don't know.  it would help if the demo actually worked.. or showed it failing
[09:48:32] <rosieres> falieson: same function with other rules . . .
[09:48:58] <falieson> yay i fixed it
[09:49:17] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/md7Ae/2/ if anyone cares
[09:49:22] <stribor> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/SAuNh/109/.....it works here
[09:49:34] <stribor> ajpiano: i dont know why it doesnt work on limesurvey
[09:49:35] <ravenzz> wat 109
[09:49:36] <ravenzz> :d
[09:50:22] <lxg> when using $.ajax(), how can i handle the response to a jsonp request as pure json?
[09:50:40] <lxg> i tried with dataType : "jsonp text json", but that didn't do
[09:51:27] <ravenzz> stribor what are you trying to do?
[09:52:43] <stribor> ravenzz: based on user input prevent submiting the form....so if user enters 3 prevent submit otherwise allow
[09:52:47] <rosieres> falieson: next time do your tests like this . . . http://jsfiddle.net/md7Ae/4/
[09:53:34] <stribor> ravenzz: so since submit happens by clicking on submit button and also on enter key press so i have to prevent submit
[09:54:49] <ravenzz> so you have to prevent the submission on click and on enter?
[09:55:15] <stribor> ravenzz: yes
[09:55:24] <jeffsmykil> what do i need to do to change the dropdown itself when changing the value?
[09:55:37] <stribor> ravenzz: problem is that i have to do that using lime survey
[09:56:00] <falieson> rosieres: ok! thanks
[09:56:29] <falieson> I heart #jquery
[09:57:10] <ravenzz> what is lime survey
[09:57:11] <stribor> ravenzz: are you familiar with limesurvey
[09:57:17] <Nedlinpopo> has anyone here looked at the lexer in handlebars?
[09:57:44] <ravenzz> no.
[09:57:57] <stribor> ravenzz: its web app for surveys
[09:58:21] <ravenzz> ok but your question is related to a form submission
[09:58:25] <ravenzz> so let's solve that
[09:58:28] <stribor> ravenzz: ok
[09:58:59] <stribor> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/SAuNh/109/ <- this detects both click and enter
[09:59:06] <ravenzz> you need to prevent that on click and enter?
[09:59:17] <ravenzz> ok so then what?
[09:59:18] <n8o-mba> yesterday I asked about qunit and jenkins and got a response to talk to someone specifically, and have since lost the msg
[09:59:19] <stribor> ravenzz: when i pass this to lime survey it detects only clicks
[09:59:34] <n8o-mba> anyone recall?
[10:00:09] <ajpiano> n8o-mba: you should talk to jorn zaefferer
[10:00:24] <n8o-mba> ajpiano: is he on irc?
[10:00:55] <ajpiano> yes, you can find him in #jquery-dev or #jqueryui-dev
[10:01:15] <n8o-mba> ajpiano: thanks
[10:01:24] <ravenzz> stribor take in mind that e.type returns the event type, is that what you need?
[10:02:05] <stribor> ravenzz: well for right now i just want to see what kind of event is produced on click and on enter in "string"...so i can see whats actually happening
[10:03:15] <ravenzz> ok can you provide an limesurvey example?
[10:03:15] <stribor> ravenzz: and itcorrectly outputs "submit" when i click...but when i "enter" it doesnt output anything which i take that submit event didnt even happen
[10:04:40] <stribor> ravenzz: there is no example...i just paste the code inside the question
[10:04:54] <ravenzz> well i would suggest to try this http://jsfiddle.net/Rhg9G/
[10:05:22] <ravenzz> what is the code inside the question? :[
[10:06:23] <stribor> ravenzz: same as here -> http://jsfiddle.net/SAuNh/109/           where form id = "limesurvey"
[10:06:49] <ravenzz> no wait, try the code I gave to you, and take a look at the console
[10:07:27] <stribor> ravenzz: it says console not defined
[10:07:56] <stribor> ravenzz: it says console not defined when i go to firefox "tools" error console
[10:10:15] <stribor> ravenzz: empty string passed to console
[10:10:39] <Whirl3d> Why is it that fadeIn doesn't work if you set css opacity to 0.
[10:13:07] <BarelyFitz> Whirl3d: what do you mean, can you post a fiddle?
[10:14:30] <Whirl3d> $("div.fader").css("opacity",0).fadeIn(1000) should set the div with class fader to 0 opacity and then fadein, but it doesn't
[10:14:46] <Whirl3d> $("div.fader").fadeOut().fadeIn(1000); works fine
[10:14:47] <snowfox_ben> the inline styling should overwrite your opacity value set in the css
[10:15:17] <snowfox_ben> Hmm, cancel what I said....b/c both are inline
[10:15:32] <BarelyFitz> try .fadeTo(1000, 1)
[10:15:51] <Whirl3d> BarelyFitz, what is the 1 for?
[10:16:00] <Whirl3d> Oh, nvm
[10:16:38] <Whirl3d> I quit using fadeIn and fadeOut---I use animate. I just wondered what the possible logic could be
[10:17:16] <Aquaguy> hey
[10:17:28] <stribor> ravenzz: Whirl3d i tried it in limestruevy and outpur in console is "submit" when i click.....but when i i hit enter i get "The 'charCode' property of a keydown event should not be used. The value is meaningless. /public_html/lime/index.php Line 0
[10:17:48] <Aquaguy> how can I check a radio input with jquery .attr('checked', true) or 'checked' instead of true dont seem to work
[10:18:30] <Whirl3d> aquaguy, try something like $(".radiobuttonclass").is(":checked")
[10:19:13] <Whirl3d> ?charCode
[10:19:14] <bot-t> Whirl3d, event.which - For key or button events, this attribute indicates the specific button or key that was pressed. http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
[10:19:38] <BarelyFitz> Whirl3d: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6045636/css-and-opacity-following-fadein-not-working and http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9336
[10:19:54] <adv_> if i have a function foo in a.html , can i access it from another function bar in b.js ?
[10:20:20] <Pilate> depends on which script is executed first
[10:20:36] <Whirl3d> BarelyFitz, thanks. I looked briefly in the jquery bugs report but didn't see it for 1.6.4, I thought it was resolved by now.
[10:21:02] <adv_> Pilate, b.js first
[10:21:18] <stribor> ravenzz: i dont think thats even error...i am not using keypress ...online it suggest i should use keydown....but i am not using any i am just trying to detect event
[10:21:26] <BarelyFitz> Whirl3d: is seems a bit weird to me, not sure what the resolution was, they just mention some meeting notes
[10:21:35] <Nedlinpopo> can anyone here interpret this regex? regex = "/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+(?=[=} /.])/"
[10:21:42] <Aquaguy> Whirl3d, that returns false
[10:22:31] <ravenzz> stribor I am back..sorry
[10:22:41] <ravenzz> stribor so do you have firebug?
[10:23:12] <Whirl3d> Aquaguy, are you using a selector that selects the correct radio button element?
[10:23:15] <stribor> ravenzz: yeah i did check it.. in fiddle i get good output for click and enter
[10:23:48] <Whirl3d> if you use $(".radiobuttonclass").is(":checked") will just check the first element in the class.
[10:23:59] <stribor> ravenzz: when i try to do same in limesurvey i get good output for click but on enter i get "The 'charCode' property of a keydown event should not be used. The value is meaningless
[10:24:02] <ravenzz> so what do you get when you try that with your app?
[10:24:12] <Whirl3d> so, I guess $("#theradiobutton").is(":checked") is better, sorry
[10:24:44] <stribor> ravenzz: "The 'charCode' property of a keydown event should not be used. The value is meaningless.....which is not even error its just warning
[10:25:14] <ravenzz> oh time ago I got that message too, but I can't remember how I figured it out
[10:25:18] <Aquaguy> Whirl3d, I'm doing it when creating the element, so yes.
[10:25:21] <ravenzz> yep
[10:25:43] <Aquaguy> Whirl3d, $(document.createElement('input')).attr({type : 'radio', name : 'choice', value : i, id : 'choice_' + i}).attr('checked', 'checked').appendTo(prompter);
[10:25:45] <BarelyFitz> Nedlinpopo: http://xenon.stanford.edu/~xusch/regexp/analyzer.html
[10:26:11] <ravenzz> stribor I suppose that it shows that warning because there could be different key maps?!
[10:26:17] <Aquaguy> it creates the radio button correctly, everything works great but the checked part
[10:26:20] <ravenzz> I suppose..
[10:26:33] <ravenzz> ask to google or on #javascript
[10:26:35] <stribor> ravenzz:really?
[10:26:50] <detrate> pardon my ignorance but the rewrite of jQuery boiler plate doesn't give an initialization example... how do I init a plugin I write in it? http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[10:27:25] <detrate> I've tried various combinations such as: $.myPlugin("#element"); || $("#element").myPlugin();
[10:28:26] <ravenzz> detrate defaultPluginName() ?
[10:28:56] <ajpiano> detrate: $("foo").whatever();
[10:29:11] <ravenzz> yep that one
[10:29:20] <foo> yay
[10:29:25] <detrate> ahh yes... my bad I had a spelling mistake
[10:29:29] <detrate> thanks
[10:33:01] <stribor> ravenzz: this is html for limesurvey submit button .....http://jsfiddle.net/YF2r4/
[10:33:39] <ravenzz> stribor oh well you could use which
[10:33:46] <ravenzz> instead of charCode
[10:33:52] <ravenzz> http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
[10:34:16] <stribor> ravenzz: yeah but how do i then detect click and enter at same time...can you show me simple example
[10:34:54] <adv_> i have this snippet function showResponse(responseText, statusText, xhr, $form)  { console.log ("ok"); } , first time i hit the submit button it displays one ok, 2nd time three ok, 3rd time six ok etc
[10:35:04] <adv_> why is this happening and how can i fix it?
[10:36:39] <skamikaze> adv_: can you show us the live example / a jsfiddle?
[10:39:51] <Z3R0> Anyone here familiar with datatables() ?
[10:40:49] <stribor> ravenzz: i am lost on how to prevent botn click and enter at same time
[10:45:58] <biodegabriel> Hey all, Is there a tool that analyzes a jQuery script and removes the unnecessary functions from the jQuery library, making the lib file smaller?
[10:46:14] <ajpiano> no, there isn't
[10:46:43] <ajpiano> closure compiler in advanced mode doesn't presently work on jquery
[10:46:53] <biodegabriel> ajpiano:  thx
[10:50:33] <stribor> ravenzz: this is what i came up with -> http://jsfiddle.net/YF2r4/1/        how do i prevent submievent now
[10:51:00] <pootpoot> ive been using easing with jQuery.animate() without including an easing plugin this whole time???
[10:51:08] <pootpoot> is that possible
[10:51:16] <ajpiano> yes, there are two easings built into jQuery core
[10:51:33] <pootpoot> oh? which are those
[10:52:24] <tim____> hi everyone
[10:52:41] <tim____> i have a couple noob questions, anyone game?
[10:52:54] <sneakyness> don't ask to ask just ask
[10:53:07] <tim____> true
[10:53:14] <pootpoot> tim____ i will never answer
[10:53:47] <tim____> i can see it is a rough crowd 0_0
[10:54:26] <tim____> i am working on a php site, have used the alert function to make sure jquery and my javascript file are loading
[10:54:40] <tim____> the functions tho are not. I am using show/hide
[10:55:35] <cakehero> Can I "listen" for a divs size to change and trigger an event?
[10:55:37] <adv_> http://pastebin.com/9yJ8zPzd anyone knows why this code produces 1 ok the 1st time , 3 ok the 2nd time and 6 ok 3rd time etc?
[10:56:21] <pootpoot> tim____: jQuery(document).ready( function() { alert("ready"); });
[10:56:41] <cakehero> Change doesn't seem to do it
[10:56:45] <ajpiano> cakehero: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[10:56:56] <cakehero> ajpiano k
[10:57:19] <cakehero> lol @ "cowboy", heh
[10:58:57] <axel> I have a checkbox list, every time i click on an item it updates a textbox with checked value but when i remove the checkbox the item doesn't get removed from the textbox it adds the same item again http://jsfiddle.net/ve473/1/  How can I solve this?
[11:00:50] <cakehero> ajpiano aiyah not working, sad face
[11:00:54] <NiX_> having a stupid jquery problem with IE (no, i cant tell them not to use IE) .....
[11:01:03] <NiX_> S file: http://pastebin.com/yVyqkbs0
[11:01:10] <NiX_> JS file*
[11:01:22] <NiX_> example page (with notes) : http://www.dontsnooze.com/amos/help/avsForm2.php
[11:01:32] <NiX_> works great in FF !
[11:01:50] <NiX_> but in IE theres one simple problem which is tieing the whole thing up
[11:02:08] <cakehero> NiX_ tell them not to use IE
[11:02:08] <NiX_> i dont think its reading the data response back as xml data
[11:02:31] <adv_> anyone?
[11:02:41] <NiX_> cakehero: =\
[11:02:45] <ajpiano> NiX_: try using $.parseXML( xml )
[11:02:47] <ajpiano> ?parseXML
[11:02:48] <bot-t> jQuery.parseXML(data): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[11:03:19] <cakehero> adv_ I know why
[11:03:31] <adv_> cakehero, shoot
[11:03:32] <cakehero> adv_ because you are adding the "submit" function each time you click
[11:03:48] <NiX_> ajpiano: funny thing is, the functions works fine on initial load, it only doesnt work when the function is called from another function
[11:04:00] <cakehero> adv_ line 13 is being run one time, then the event is bound, then it's run a second time (and the event is bound twice)
[11:04:01] <ajpiano> you're right, that is hilarious
[11:04:35] <cakehero> adv_ wait, maybe not
[11:04:40] <cakehero> ajpiano heh
[11:04:49] <cakehero> ajpiano maybe he should try comedy/
[11:04:50] <cakehero> ?
[11:04:53] <cakehero> better luck in that field
[11:05:14] * NiX_ goes back to google
[11:05:57] <adv_> cakehero, how can i fix that?
[11:06:00] <NiX_> well let me try the parse
[11:06:08] <cakehero> adv_ idk i might be wrong actually, how are you running the code?
[11:06:08] <NiX_> its worth a shot
[11:06:15] <NiX_> nothing else is working lol
[11:06:39] <adv_> cakehero, i have a form and clicking on a submit button
[11:06:56] <cakehero> adv_ why is document ready there?
[11:06:57] <stribor> can anone show me how to detect if event is click or keypress
[11:07:16] <adv_> cakehero, shouldn't it? i took it from an example
[11:09:37] <stribor> can someone show me example how to detect is user clicked or pressed key
[11:09:39] <NiX_> i found something on google
[11:09:53] <NiX_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/562283/jquery-find-doesnt-return-data-in-ie-but-does-in-firefox-and-chrome
[11:10:21] <adv_> cakehero, if it is what you say it is, how do i fix it?
[11:12:32] <NiX_> question: in JS when the $ is added before a variable is that just for the programmer to know its jquery?
[11:12:42] <ajpiano> yes, see ?$prefix
[11:12:43] <bot-t> yes, It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[11:13:02] <NiX_> nice good bot
[11:13:04] <NiX_> thx
[11:13:15] <NiX_> putting thru the parse xml now
[11:13:18] <NiX_> really hoping it works
[11:13:23] <NiX_> hate ie
[11:13:37] <Whirl3d> This is probably a stupid question, but if you have multiple objects in a jquery collection and you say, $(".active").removeClass("active")  it removes the "active" class from all elements, not just the first one right?
[11:14:35] <axel> I have a checkbox list, every time i click on an item it updates a textbox with checked value but when i remove the checkbox the item doesn't get removed from the textbox it adds the same item again http://jsfiddle.net/ve473/1/  How can I solve this?
[11:15:59] <NiX_> var xmlDoc = $.parseXML( response );   <--- does that look right?
[11:16:10] <ajpiano> yes
[11:16:24] <NiX_> ok i need to do it in a couple places so wanted to check first
[11:16:26] <NiX_> thx
[11:16:28] <Z3R0> anyone familiar with jquery datatables, few questions and updating table data upon event change
[11:16:37] <NiX_> hmmm
[11:16:53] <NiX_> ajpiano: am i able to do this? :  response = $.parseXML( response );
[11:17:22] <NiX_> heh i may b pushing it with that 1
[11:17:44] <Z3R0> currently, all the data loads via ajax (json response) via the sAjaxSource: ''; property, but how can I get a new response from the server and update the table with say, a checkbox trigger... the trigger of the event isn't complicated, it's re-populating the datatable
[11:18:26] <ajpiano> theoretically, yes... you can assign it to a variable
[11:18:37] <ajpiano> if you're trying to like, magically make ajax return out of the callback, no you can't do that
[11:19:10] <Z3R0> Whirl3d: Yes
[11:20:04] <Gates> does jquery allow me to draw lines between two points
[11:20:44] <Z3R0> Gates, I don't see why you can't, there's numerous graph programs that are built around that
[11:21:25] <stribor> guys i am confused about something..........pressing "enter" key..does that create "submit" event  or "keypress" event
[11:21:46] <Gates> like figure out the point (x,y) of this div and point of another div and draw a line?
[11:21:48] <Gates> Z3R0: ?
[11:22:00] <Z3R0> Gates: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4712189/how-to-draw-a-line-between-2-elements-using-jquery-and-refreshing-that-line
[11:22:35] <Gates> thats a clot of code
[11:22:36] <Gates> wooah
[11:23:00] <Z3R0> you consider that alot of code? lol
[11:23:07] <Gates> does it need to be html5
[11:23:14] <Gates> its a footer thats a reverse bar graph
[11:23:24] <Gates> (aka the bars go downwards instead of up)
[11:23:26] <Z3R0> don't know, and that's using a function created to do the center of elements
[11:23:34] <Z3R0> so you just need to revise it to do exact points
[11:23:36] <Gates> :o
[11:24:17] <Gates> Z3R0: something like this but all css/jquery (so the boxes are always the right height)
[11:24:18] <Gates> http://grab.by/cL7X
[11:24:29] <ajpiano> Gates: there's this http://jsplumb.org/jquery/demo.html
[11:24:30] <Z3R0> check this : http://www.openstudio.fr/Library-for-simple-drawing-with.html
[11:24:33] <phrearch> hey
[11:24:46] <stribor> ajpiano: can you help me with above question please
[11:24:58] <ajpiano> stribor: enter will trigger a keypress and a submit
[11:25:08] <Gates> that looks dead on ajpiano
[11:25:17] <NiX_> ok so that broke it
[11:25:19] <NiX_> shoot
[11:25:25] <NiX_> broke it in firefox too
[11:25:32] <NiX_> i must be doing something wrong
[11:25:49] <Z3R0> NiX_: got fiddle?
[11:25:54] <stribor> ajpiano: i am trying to prevent default on happening when "enter" is pressed......e.defaultPrevent() but it doesnt prevent it
[11:26:03] <Gates> ajpiano: thats a big one eh
[11:26:15] <ajpiano> stribor: link your fiddle again?
[11:26:20] <ajpiano> also... it's not defaultPrevent()...
[11:26:27] <NiX_> hehe
[11:26:40] <stribor> preventDefault();
[11:26:43] <stribor> just typo
[11:26:44] <NiX_> ok i only have 2 lines of code so im going to paste them in the channel
[11:27:01] <NiX_> i have:  var xmlDoc = $.parseXML( response );
[11:27:02] <Z3R0> sounds fun NiX_
[11:27:03] <NiX_> $(xmlDoc).find(selectId).each(function(){
[11:27:14] <NiX_> u guys see anything wrong there?
[11:27:19] <ajpiano> xmlDoc.find(selectId)
[11:27:24] <Z3R0> ya
[11:27:25] <ajpiano> or not actually
[11:27:32] <Z3R0> hmmm
[11:27:33] <ajpiano> NiX_: you should like, debug
[11:27:36] <ajpiano> to see if any elements are found
[11:27:50] <NiX_> i am
[11:27:52] <phrearch> ajpiano, did you see the codemirror based jinfinote editor yet?
[11:27:54] <ajpiano> console.log(xmlDoc) console.log(xmlDoc.find(selectId).length) etc
[11:27:56] <NiX_> ii also returne the whole response
[11:28:03] <ajpiano> phrearch: no
[11:28:14] <phrearch> i got an example running on http://hwios.org
[11:28:25] <phrearch> added remote cursors and selection
[11:29:22] <NiX_> ajpiano: well b4 parsing, firefox was reading the xml just fine
[11:29:43] <ajpiano> NiX_: there are ways for you to find out the answers to these problems
[11:29:43] <NiX_> since IE is not, im trying to use that parse function to parse the already xml
[11:29:47] <ajpiano> it's called the debugger
[11:30:05] <ajpiano> either do that or provide a demo that has the whole case
[11:30:06] <stribor> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/tB6j6/
[11:30:10] <ajpiano> the xml string you're trying to parse etc
[11:30:11] <NiX_> ok
[11:30:25] <NiX_> just want to make sure i posted the line correct
[11:30:35] <NiX_> it must be wrong
[11:30:57] <NiX_> if the string im parsing is the returned data from html, does that matter?
[11:30:59] <ajpiano> stribor: why aren't you using the submit event anymore
[11:31:04] <ajpiano> that's what you need to cancel
[11:31:23] <ajpiano> NiX_: are you parsing html or arbitrary xml
[11:31:36] <stribor> ajpiano: because it works with click but not when i press enter key
[11:31:50] <ajpiano> stribor: the fiddle you had earlier worked just fine with enter key
[11:31:55] <ajpiano> i don't know what the problem was meant to be
[11:32:19] <stribor> ajpiano: it didnt work when i use it in lime survey
[11:32:33] <ajpiano> stribor: well, it works when anyone does it in any app
[11:32:50] <ajpiano> so whatever "lime survey" is, that doesn't change the fact that you have to approach the problem by canceling the submit event
[11:33:25] <stribor> ajpiano: can you show me how if you can
[11:33:47] <ajpiano> $("#someForm").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault() });
[11:35:15] <NiX_> ajpiano: im parsing xml from a page...im returning xml from a db
[11:35:17] <NiX_> ugh
[11:35:19] <NiX_> have a meeting
[11:35:24] <NiX_> will try more when i get back
[11:35:39] <ajpiano> try trying debugging
[11:38:10] <glauco29> hi there
[11:40:28] <stribor> ajpiano: i am trying to get value from user and based on value prevent submit or not ->http://jsfiddle.net/SAuNh/114/
[11:41:41] <ajpiano> you have to do that processing *inside* of the submit event
[11:42:04] <stribor> ajpiano: ?
[11:42:09] <glauco29> Is there a method that "refresh" the object references (like the .live() but instead events, objects references)?
[11:42:50] <ajpiano> stribor: http://jsfiddle.net/SAuNh/115/
[11:43:34] <ajpiano> stribor: right now the code you have says "on page load, check the value once (which will be empty)... and if it's greater than 10, bind a submit event to the form that will prevent the default always"
[11:43:38] <ajpiano> the code i wrote says
[11:43:52] <glauco29> Cause I have a form into lightbox that I fire a mask plugin, but if I close lightbox and reopen it, the mask plugin is not fired
[11:43:58] <stribor> ajpiano: that one you wrote submiys any value
[11:44:02] <ajpiano> "when the form is submitted, check the value of the input, and if at that time it is greater than 10, prevent that particular submit event"
[11:44:14] <bgy> using multiple dialog in my page how could I identify them?
[11:44:33] <bgy> it looks like the id is not transfered
[11:44:37] <bgy> only the classes
[11:44:48] <ajpiano> do you have multiple elements in your page with the same ID?
[11:44:55] <ajpiano> stribor: try this http://jsfiddle.net/SAuNh/117/
[11:45:09] <ajpiano> stribor: you can also feel free to try applying the concept i just describe, the code is only for reference..
[11:45:16] <bgy> ajpiano: afaik no, I've this  id="status-menu-<?= $this->article->getId() ?>"
[11:45:37] <ajpiano> bgy: nm, i thought that was still stribor talking to me... i have no idea what you're asking
[11:45:49] <ajpiano> bgy: it's best to track references to the dialogs themselves somewhere
[11:46:00] <ajpiano> var d = $("#myElement").dialog();
[11:46:00] <bgy> ajpiano: ahah ok, well it could have sense so.. : )
[11:46:01] <stribor> ajpiano: i know concept just trying to understand why your script is not working
[11:46:15] <ajpiano> d.addClass("bar").dialog("open") etc
[11:46:27] <ajpiano> stribor: how is my code not working
[11:47:01] <stribor> well if c > 10 it should prevent submit event right?
[11:47:05] <ajpiano> stribor: then go apply the concept
[11:47:14] <ajpiano> stribor: it is
[11:47:58] <ajpiano> stribor: in any case, go apply the concept in your own code
[11:48:10] <stribor> but shouldnmt e.preventdefault prevent submit event?
[11:48:18] <ajpiano> IT IS PREVENTING IT
[11:49:41] <Aquaguy> Hey
[11:49:52] <stribor> ajpiano: ok i am sorry....i just see it sending the form...maybe i have wrong script   http://jsfiddle.net/SAuNh/117/
[11:49:58] <Z3R0> ajpiano: I'm confused as well, I've been looking and testing that script you wrote, and it always seems to be trying to post
[11:50:03] <Aquaguy> is there any way to delete a specific event? not all events but a single one
[11:50:05] <Aquaguy> $(window).keyup( function (e) { if(e.keyCode == 13) { console.log('click'); ok.click(); }
[11:50:15] <ajpiano> Z3R0: yeah i agree ther'es omething weird but ffs
[11:50:21] <Z3R0> lol
[11:50:27] <Aquaguy> but in another part of the code I have another $(window).keyup() that I want to keep.
[11:50:47] <mbtez> i'm confused.. LIKE/ILIKE are just substr right?
[11:50:54] <cakehero> adv_ I would wrap the entire block in document ready
[11:50:56] <Z3R0> why arne't they combined Aquaguy  ?
[11:51:19] <adv_> cakehero, which entire block?
[11:51:21] <ajpiano> Aquaguy: you can use a namespaced event ("keyup.foo") , or a function reference for binding and unbinding
[11:51:35] <adv_> out of .click and till the end ?
[11:51:38] <Z3R0> ah... always forget about namespaces
[11:51:43] <Aquaguy> Z3R0, one of them is from a plugin the other one is mine.
[11:51:52] <Aquaguy> ajpiano, thank you
[11:54:26] <glauco29> Is there a method that "refresh" the object references (like the .live() but instead events, objects references)?
[11:54:56] <glauco29> Cause I have a form into lightbox that I fire a mask plugin, but if I close lightbox and reopen it, the mask plugin is not fired
[11:58:53] <Nedlinpopo> anyone here use ruby on ubuntu?
[11:59:12] <Nedlinpopo> i've cloned the handlebars repo, but i can't get it to build
[11:59:30] * Nedlinpopo is a python guy
[12:07:43] <Z3R0> ajpiano: you familiar with datatables at all ?
[12:07:50] <ajpiano> no
[12:08:19] <Z3R0> lol ok thanks anyways
[12:12:41] <MagBo> Nedlinpopo: you must be from Slitherine
[12:13:02] <Nedlinpopo> MagBo: ?
[12:13:19] <Nedlinpopo> you mean Slitherin house of the Harry Potter books?
[12:13:44] <Nedlinpopo> or some unkown place onteh globe?
[12:19:59] <GatorAlli> anyone here expertise with flot?
[12:30:55] <chrisinajar> Hi, this is more a general webdev question: I have a site with a js bug in IE, but part of the propcess for this particular site is to open a new window and close the current one (or so it would appear). the problem is that when it does that, it also closes the developer console in IE, is there a way to force the console to stay open all the time?
[12:31:01] <Gates> hmm
[12:31:09] <Gates> ajpiano: you still there?
[12:31:15] <Gates> do i just put jsPlumb.connect() at the end to connec the dots?
[12:31:22] <Gates> does it need to b in jquery ready
[12:31:23] <ajpiano> i've never used it...
[12:31:28] <ajpiano> i'd imagine so
[12:31:56] <Gates> This is the most basic connection you can make in jsPlumb - all you have to provide is the ID of the two elements to connect
[12:32:00] <Gates> jsPlumb.connect({source:'element1', target:'element2'});
[12:32:03] <miceiken> Do you guys know of any jquery plugins that will automaticly scale a image to fit like the monitor size
[12:32:10] <Gates> idk anything about js/jquery, i assume that has to go at the bottom?
[12:32:14] <Gates> wrapped in script tags
[12:32:16] <miceiken> i need a picture to look natural
[12:32:59] <ajpiano> Gates: yes
[12:33:46] <Gates> yea doesnt work
[12:34:03] <Gates> i have it loading JQuery, then JQuery UI and then the jsPlumb
[12:35:32] <Gates> ajpiano: is this commented out the whole thing- http://jsplumb.org/js/1.3.3/demo.js
[12:36:10] <ajpiano> what?
[12:36:16] <ajpiano> no it isn't
[12:36:46] <Gates> im trying to figure it out =|
[12:36:48] <juha_> cool that twitter gives 404 error on their frontpage from time to time :P
[12:36:53] <Gates> it seems to be setting it to a var
[12:36:56] <Gates> i do not understnad the demo
[12:37:36] <ajpiano> Gates:  if you've never written a drop of jquery or javascript, understanding any of this is gonna be something of a challenge
[12:37:53] <Gates> ajpiano: i wouldnt say a drop but a majority
[12:38:04] <ajpiano> those are opposite
[12:38:11] <Gates> all i want to do is connect the ID for 'footer-1' and 'footer-2'
[12:38:22] <Gates> using the basic unstyled connect
[12:38:41] <Gates> OR copy "var connection5 ..." to be stand alone?
[12:39:14] <ajpiano> can you set up your markup and files inside of a jsfiddle?
[12:39:30] <Gates> surely
[12:39:43] <ajpiano> (you can link the js for jsplumb in the left side panel, "add resources")
[12:40:06] <Gates> i assume i need jquery-ui too
[12:41:02] <ajpiano> yes but there's a checkbox for that once you select jquery
[12:41:28] <davidthedrake> How can I revert a change() event on a select element if a user doesn't confirm the change? I have $(element).change(someFunc) and someFunc(event). stopPropagation or preventDefault on the event seem to be called too late.
[12:41:34] <Gates> ajpiano: always awesome
[12:41:37] <Gates> give me one second
[12:44:23] <Whirl3d> are there any specific reasons that a setTimeout function would refuse to run? I get the variable assignment  var x=setTimeout(doSomething,300); console.log(x) and it shows that x is getting assigned, but it never calls "doSomething"
[12:46:59] <Asone> >>var x=setTimeout(doSomething,300); console.log(x)
[12:47:16] <Asone> 'k, i'll have to check the bot manual
[12:47:17] <Asone> :)
[12:47:36] <Asone> crap, i'm not on the right channel
[12:47:37] <Asone> >_>
[12:47:47] <Gates> ajpiano: how do i save this correctly?
[12:48:05] <ajpiano> hit save or update in the top
[12:48:32] <Gates> dumb questions FTW
[12:49:10] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/Vk9cL/1/
[12:49:13] <Gates> of course it works there...
[12:49:19] <Gates> why doesnt it work local =[
[12:50:48] <Whirl3d> It's in a jquery callback if that helps. assone
[12:51:41] <Gates> ajpiano: it works there
[12:51:43] <Gates> just not here lol
[12:52:27] <ajpiano> 'taint like me
[12:52:27] <Whirl3d> Assone, in fact, it works fine outside of the jQuery callback. Inside it fails.
[12:55:00] <ajpiano> it isn't working for me
[12:55:27] <ajpiano> make sure the code is executing at all, Gates
[12:56:14] <Gates> im sorry, what does //<![CDATA[ do
[12:56:22] <b1lly> lets say i wanted to create a global multi dimensional array
[12:56:28] <b1lly> that isn't limited to the scope of the function
[12:56:42] <ajpiano> ?w CDATA
[12:56:44] <bot-t> ajpiano, CDATA - The term CDATA, meaning character data, is used for distinct, but related, purposes in the markup languages SGML and XML. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDATA
[12:57:06] <Gates> it helps my js?
[12:57:09] <Gates> oh i c
[12:58:33] <Gates> ajpiano: does it work for you? http://jsfiddle.net/w9E5g/
[12:58:56] <sphinxxx> whats the command to insert an element within another element, but at the end of it
[12:59:00] <sphinxxx> so not before or after
[12:59:11] <sphinxxx> but was also hoping to avoid using .html
[12:59:18] <ajpiano> .append
[12:59:28] <sphinxxx> thx!
[13:00:03] <ajpiano> Gates: once you include jquery ui, it kinda works
[13:00:21] <Gates> hm what browser
[13:00:40] <ajpiano> chrome
[13:00:45] <ajpiano> but you don't have ui included in the version you sent me
[13:01:38] <Gates> its something with the elements
[13:01:41] <b1lly> i have a var blah = 2 but i think javascript is thinking its a string
[13:01:43] <Gates> cuz i got it to work with other elments
[13:01:46] <b1lly> is there a way to make it a integer
[13:01:49] <Gates> it might be the rest of css
[13:02:01] <BarelyFitz> b1lly: var n = parseInt(myvar, 10)
[13:02:05] <ajpiano> Gates: that's what i mean maybe, it's kinda working
[13:02:10] <ajpiano> like the handles move but the elements dont
[13:06:14] <Gates> ajpiano: i moved it to inline and not in the footer
[13:06:16] <Gates> same sorta code
[13:06:18] <Gates> and it works
[13:06:29] <Gates> so im prob just clsoe, ill take a break from it
[13:06:34] <Gates> thanks for all your help ajpiano
[13:06:42] <ajpiano> welcome :)
[13:07:24] <yvorl_> Hi!
[13:08:25] <yvorl_> Can I use :contains() to search in hidden divs? (I type a string to a text field, click on a button which triggers the function)
[13:09:59] <catcher> Can jQuery apply handlers to multiple classes with similar names with a glob? i.e. $('.myclass*')  where the * will match myclass1, myclass2 etc.
[13:10:42] <catcher> selectors* rather than handlers
[13:11:29] <erichynds> catcher: no
[13:11:36] <erichynds> catcher: $(".class1, .class2")
[13:11:37] <Whirl3d> I am having a hard time getting setTimeout to work within a jQuery callback. Any suggestions: http://jsfiddle.net/UHC2Y/1/
[13:11:46] <ibizaman> hi all, I can't seem to find a plugin that replaces a select box and permits : ajax loading with autocomplete and multiple selection allowed
[13:12:02] <catcher> erichynds, the classes are dynamically generated, no way to pick them up this way?
[13:12:14] <eddiemonge> ibizaman:  did you look at jqui autocomplete?
[13:12:15] <techlands> how would i select and element by id but only if that element was a certain type like a <select>
[13:12:19] <catcher> I suppose you did already say no ;)
[13:12:23] <erichynds> catcher: nope
[13:12:31] <eddiemonge> techlands: $('select#id')
[13:12:52] <eddiemonge> techlands: but the type shouldnt matter since ids are supposed to be unique across all types
[13:12:59] <Z3R0> why would you do that? select#id ... aren't id's unique? why would you need that
[13:13:21] <Z3R0> ;)
[13:13:30] <sameerynho> how can i encode an object to JSON ?
[13:13:40] <ibizaman> eddiemonge: yes but it does not seem to be able to handle mutliple selections, or does it ?
[13:13:41] <Z3R0> what language?
[13:13:46] <eddiemonge> techlands: plus doing something like select#id is a lot slower than just #id
[13:13:55] <Z3R0> php -> encode_json($stuff);
[13:14:00] <eddiemonge> ?jsonify
[13:14:01] <bot-t> eddiemonge, jQuery.trim() - Remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/
[13:14:24] <Z3R0> if you want multiple selects, then use a class
[13:14:30] <Z3R0> and $(.classname)
[13:14:58] <eddiemonge> sameerynho: for what purpose?
[13:15:06] <eddiemonge> ibizaman: it can
[13:15:09] <sameerynho> eddiemonge: sending a post request
[13:15:19] <Z3R0> sameerynho: I just told you above
[13:15:37] <ibizaman> eddiemonge: yep... I did not see... thk
[13:15:39] <Z3R0> sorry it's json_encode()
[13:15:39] <eddiemonge> sameerynho: using $.post() to send data to a sever?
[13:15:50] <sameerynho> eddiemonge: yeah
[13:15:54] <eddiemonge> sameerynho: no need to
[13:15:59] <sameerynho> Z3R0: i did not use pho
[13:16:19] <eddiemonge> sameerynho: $.post(url, dataobject, successfn) see ? jquery.post
[13:16:19] <sameerynho> eddiemonge: so sending the object it self as value will be ok, am i right?
[13:16:19] <bot-t> sameerynho, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[13:17:03] <Z3R0> ya you should be able to reference the object methods and properties from the return
[13:17:52] <eddiemonge> sameerynho: as long as its like "var dataobject = {key:value}" you should be fine to use what i said
[13:18:09] <b1lly> lets say i have a for loop
[13:18:17] <b1lly> and i want to delay about 2 seconds before it iterates again
[13:19:58] <eddiemonge> b1lly: for what purpose?
[13:20:30] <b1lly> im using html5
[13:20:37] <b1lly> and im drawing something on the canvas
[13:20:55] <b1lly> if i dont delay the next itteration, it just draws the entire pattern
[13:21:01] <b1lly> i want to delay it so that it looks like its actually drawing
[13:21:06] <eddiemonge> use a function and settimeout instead of a loop then
[13:21:30] <b1lly> hmm?
[13:21:45] <b1lly> its looping through an array
[13:21:46] <eddiemonge> or have the settimeout in the loop but you will have to have a timer or something that gets incremented every count
[13:22:44] <airportyh> b1lly: something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/957810/ui-responsiveness-and-javascript
[13:28:20] <b1lly> airportyh: http://pastie.org/2725948
[13:28:24] <b1lly> i commented what i wanted to delay
[13:29:03] <airportyh> b1lly: no, you need to get rid of the for loop altogether
[13:29:16] <b1lly> how am i gunna itterate thru the array then?
[13:29:38] <airportyh> by using array.shift() to pop each element off it
[13:31:48] <airportyh> b1lly: http://pastie.org/2725974
[13:32:35] <yvorl_> Hi, I've problems using contains and variable at the same time (eg var str = ("n")   $("div:contains(str)").show(); ) any suggestion?
[13:32:51] <airportyh> b1lly: you could also do it in batches at a time
[13:33:08] <airportyh> for example 5 at a time or 10 at a time depending on how cpu intensive it is
[13:33:15] <b1lly> i have a multi demensional array with all the coordinates to draw
[13:33:29] <b1lly> patharray[path_index][path_coordinates]
[13:36:11] <eddiemonge> b1lly: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/gJDav/
[13:36:57] <eddiemonge> yvorl_: $("div:contains("+str+")").show();
[13:37:01] <eddiemonge> ?contains
[13:37:01] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[13:38:46] <eddiemonge> b1lly: my solution doesnt require altering the array at all
[13:39:22] <yvorl_> eddiemonge: thx (btw this method is only in comments not in the main article)
[13:39:54] <Yuri_Out> hi, I have a problem with show() and hide()
[13:40:06] <Yuri_Out> when I use show(), the element is shown,
[13:40:15] <Yuri_Out> like I used display: block in css
[13:41:09] <Yuri_Out> but when I try to get the display attr
[13:41:10] <Yuri_Out> from that element
[13:41:12] <b1lly> eddeddiemonge: i dont think thats right
[13:41:14] <Yuri_Out> it is always undefined
[13:41:31] <eddiemonge> Yuri_Out: .css('display')
[13:41:53] <eddiemonge> b1lly: its the actual code but the idea of how it could be done
[13:42:41] <lmatteis> is doing jqueryObj[0].shit; equal to jqueryObj.attr('shit')
[13:43:10] <iYuri> lol
[13:43:14] <iYuri> it was so easy XD
[13:43:27] <tash> I've got a div which shows a banner, then thumbs under it .. each time I click on a thumb, I want the banner to change to the full size pic of that thumb ... can someone point me in the right direction?
[13:43:32] <iYuri> tnx
[13:43:55] <eddiemonge> lmatteis: sometimes
[13:44:09] <lmatteis> eddiemonge: what does "sometimes" mean?
[13:44:20] <eddiemonge> tash: .attr() with .click()
[13:44:33] <eddiemonge> lmatteis: it means not always and not never
[13:44:41] <eddiemonge> ?g define:sometimes
[13:44:43] <bot-t> eddiemonge, No results found for 'define:sometimes'.
[13:44:45] <Falcon> hurr, considering the size of this channel i think i shall turn logging off
[13:45:07] <lmatteis> eddiemonge: so when is it different and when is it the same?
[13:46:26] <eddiemonge> ?tias @ lmatteis
[13:46:26] <bot-t> lmatteis, Try It And See
[13:47:17] <lmatteis> eddiemonge: so, if the jqueryObj is a single element, those are semantically the same thing, right?
[13:48:22] <eddiemonge> lmatteis: you lost me
[13:48:53] <argodk> is _updatebuttons() a jquery function?
[13:49:38] <dcope> Is there a jquery plugin that allows to have a grid of album art and change the style? ie, grid vs. list?
[13:49:41] <eddiemonge> argodk: no. and if it is, its not a public one
[13:49:42] <yvorl_> eddie: thx again have a nice day!
[13:49:48] <argodk> eddiemonge thanks
[13:51:10] <argodk> I have a function with this line: self._updateButtons(true);
[13:51:22] <argodk> but when I search the code, I can’t find the function _updateButtons()
[13:51:45] <argodk> that’s why I was thinking it’s a jquery or even javascript function
[13:52:11] <eddiemonge> look for "_updateButtons:"
[13:52:14] <Matt_> hey
[13:52:27] <eddiemonge> argodk: its a method of an object
[13:52:39] <argodk> ok
[13:52:57] <Z3R0> what's the difference between this and self?
[13:53:03] <argodk> ahh I see it now.. thanks eddiemonge
[13:53:53] <argodk> is there a way to run through code as if it’s executing so you can see the value of variables and such?
[13:54:11] <ajpiano> argodk: see ?ftj

[13:54:16] <argodk> thanks
[13:54:57] <eddiemonge> Z3R0: this is native js while self is often just "var self = this"
[13:55:13] <matt_js_> I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/qFPNr/, but I'm having trouble with it, when I hover/"unhover" over it repeatedly it keeps on running
[13:55:16] <Z3R0> ah so self is technically just a var
[13:55:35] <ProLoser|Work> http://turntable.fm/freenode

[14:01:35] <fission6> whats the recommended method for a json ajax call?
[14:03:42] <Falcon> fission6: $.getJSON i guess
[14:04:04] <chrisinajar> fission6: i use $.ajax
[14:04:14] <chrisinajar> with dataType: "json"
[14:04:18] <Falcon> that's just too raw :|
[14:04:31] <fission6> ok thanks
[14:06:06] <catcher> Hey all, after a couple days of research, asking again - I'm using the flowplayer tooltip jquery plug - The tooltip fires up with the title just fine, but I can't seem to get a click handler pointing to the right link (since it's dynamically generated by php)
[14:06:09] <catcher> Here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/hm4gf/
[14:06:52] <fission6> chrisinajar: do i need to put $.ajax inside an on body load blok?
[14:07:09] <catcher> It always uses the href to the first item (which makes sense). Can't seem to figure out how to make it look for the newest item (I've tried next and last as well)
[14:07:15] <fission6> sorry, $(document).ready(function(){
[14:09:48] <chrisinajar> fission6: put it wherever you want it to run
[14:10:44] <eddiemonge> tash $(thumb).click(function(e){ $(bigpic).attr('src', $(this).attr('src').replace('thumb', '')); })
[14:12:26] <eddiemonge> catcher: is .tooltip the actual tooltip popup?
[14:13:27] <chrisinajar> catcher: do you have a live version of this somewhere i can hit?
[14:14:10] <catcher> eddiemonge, Yes, the .tooltip is the actual popup
[14:14:21] <catcher> chrisinajar, unfortunately it's a dev server only
[14:14:24] <Rafaelzinhu> hi
[14:14:37] <jcrawford> hey guys i have some code that outputs json and I am using jquery .ajax to hit that endpoint, I have verified in Firebug that the content-type is JSON, however in my success callback the variable when alerted says [object XMLDocument], any thoughts as to why this might be happening?
[14:14:45] <jcrawford> i run the json through jsonlint and it is valid json
[14:15:02] <eddiemonge> catcher: and what html markup does it generate? is it associated with the anchor .fortooltip at all?
[14:15:16] <chrisinajar> jcrawford: are you using dataType: "json"?
[14:15:43] <jcrawford> no let me add that
[14:15:45] <jcrawford> second
[14:16:33] <thinkclay> is there any kind of encryption method in Jquery like sha1 that encrypts and decrypts and would also work on the backend with PHP?
[14:17:21] <tash> if I don't know the id of something and want to console.log it, would this make since? var id = $(this).attr('id'); console.log(id); and run that onclick of the image I want the id of?
[14:17:41] <chrisinajar> thinkclay: sha isn't encryption, it's hashing. what are you trying to do?
[14:17:50] <eddiemonge> tash: yes
[14:17:52] <min|dvir|us> Hi. I am submitting a form into an iframe. How do I get when it's done?
[14:18:00] <catcher> eddiemonge, looking...
[14:18:09] <thinkclay> well that's what i mean really. I'm trying to obfuscate emails to avoid spam
[14:18:23] <friedbyte> With the following code I'm trying to do a simple dropdown menu. http://jsfiddle.net/k3C7J/ How can I make it so that #my-div keeps the class show when hovering over it?
[14:18:27] <thinkclay> something like a sha1 echo and then DOM replacement unhashing
[14:18:30] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: why would you do that?
[14:18:56] <eddiemonge> thinkclay: if the dom can do it then so can spambots
[14:19:07] <eddiemonge> thinkclay: anything you can do on the frontend, they can do too
[14:19:15] <min|dvir|us> eddiemonge, I'm not doing it.
[14:19:17] <chrisinajar> thinkclay: use an image, spambpts can just read the decrypted output
[14:19:18] <min|dvir|us> It's how the code is now.
[14:19:29] <thinkclay> eddiemonge: I know that, but it helps and is better than plain text
[14:19:32] <min|dvir|us> I am fixing a bug, and this is one possible solution.
[14:19:41] <chrisinajar> thinkclay: there's a service from recaptcha to hide emails, i think google uses it. i recommend that
[14:19:52] <thinkclay> cool, thanks chris
[14:20:01] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: frames of any kind are rarely a solution
[14:20:11] <chrisinajar> thinkclay: http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/
[14:20:11] <min|dvir|us> Neither is that.
[14:20:25] <min|dvir|us> I need to know exactly one thing: how to know if a form is submitted.
[14:20:30] <jcrawford> chrisinajar: thanks that fixed it, however one question
[14:20:47] <min|dvir|us> I have other possible solutions for this bug but this is the easiest, if such a method exists.
[14:20:56] <jcrawford> when I get the param from the success callback it is of type [object Object] which means valid json
[14:21:00] <eddiemonge> min|dvir|us: you get a response from the server
[14:21:33] <jcrawford> however when I do alert data.users it prints out a json string and I have to then do users = eval("(" + data.users + ")"); to convert the json string to an object
[14:21:39] <jcrawford> any idea why I have to manually do that?
[14:21:40] <chrisinajar> min|dvir|us: you can hook on the start of the submit event using .submit(handler), but not the end since it leaves that page and loads a new one. I think you can use .ready on that frame element, not positive though.
[14:21:43] <eddiemonge> jcrawford: you are alerting this out and not using console.log arent you?
[14:21:54] <min|dvir|us> chrisinajar, that's interesting.
[14:21:56] <jcrawford> eddiemonge: correct I need to learn about console.log() :)
[14:22:00] <jcrawford> still new to firebug
[14:22:05] <eddiemonge> ?ftj @ jcrawford
[14:22:06] <bot-t> jcrawford, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:22:16] <jcrawford> thanks will bookmark and read that
[14:22:36] <eddiemonge> jcrawford:  its easy. in your code, just put console.log() and it will output to the browsers console. Ctrl+alt+i usually
[14:22:38] <tash> eddiemonger: am I doing this right? http://pastie.org/2726263
[14:22:55] <jcrawford> thanks
[14:23:08] <jcrawford> any thoughts on why my json has to be eval'd otherwise it is just a string?
[14:23:26] <chrisinajar> jcrawford: probably alert's fault. test it with console.log first.
[14:23:37] <jcrawford> will do now
[14:23:52] <chrisinajar> jcrawford: i believe F12 opens the console in all 3 major browsers
[14:23:58] <chrisinajar> i know it does in chrome and IE
[14:24:09] <eddiemonge> tash: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/c9WRp/
[14:24:27] <jcrawford> hehe F12 on mac opens Mission Control :)
[14:24:28] <eddiemonge> jcrawford: paste your ajax code see ? pe
[14:24:28] <bot-t> jcrawford, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[14:24:45] <SinnerNyx> on a click event I do: img.fadeIn(1000); if I keep triggering this before the fade is completed it starts it again but only gets up to the opacity of which it was at when I clicked. For instance if I click first, and then click 500ms after (not allowing the initial fade in to complete) the subsequent fadeIn only goes to about 50%. Is there some way I can specify to fadeIn to 100% always?
[14:24:48] <eddiemonge> chrisinajar: not on mac
[14:24:50] <jcrawford> but i know how to open the console :)
[14:24:52] <jcrawford> brb
[14:25:12] <eddiemonge> ?stop @ SinnerNyx
[14:25:13] <bot-t> SinnerNyx, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[14:25:14] <chrisinajar> eddiemonge: nor on an android device
[14:25:18] <chrisinajar> moot.
[14:26:45] <fission6> is there a dump method or something for json data i can use to through the data to the screen just to review the contents?
[14:26:53] <tash> eddiemonge: .thumb in your example....is that connecting to what I want based on class="thumb" ?
[14:27:19] <chrisinajar> fission6: on chrome just use console.log, the debugger at the bottom is interactive, you can explore the object. i think it works in firefox too
[14:27:47] <jcrawford> console.log shows it as a string too
[14:28:12] <fission6> wanted to actually throw it into a div
[14:28:21] <chrisinajar> jcrawford: then your json isn't setup right. try manually hitting the ajax source page and looking at the string output
[14:28:48] <jcrawford> chrisinajar: it looks like a string there too, php is outputting with echo json_encode($obj);
[14:28:56] <chrisinajar> exactly
[14:29:02] <chrisinajar> look at it and figure out what's wrong
[14:29:10] <chrisinajar> with the things on either side of your nose
[14:29:15] <jcrawford> i have there is nothing obvious
[14:29:21] <jcrawford> content-type: json
[14:29:21] <chrisinajar> look again
[14:29:24] <chrisinajar> not that
[14:29:28] <chrisinajar> the actual string
[14:29:34] <chrisinajar> look at it character by character
[14:29:48] <chrisinajar> or pastebin it to me and i'll tell you :P
[14:30:41] <fission6> what if i just want to loop through my returned json and print out the fields, would i use jquery or just javascirpt
[14:30:46] <jcrawford> http://pastebin.com/3Xq0W9BD
[14:30:54] <jcrawford> jsonlint says it is valid json
[14:31:13] <chrisinajar> valid json yes, valid data probably not.
[14:31:20] <chrisinajar> a comment is valid code, doesn't mean it does what you want.
[14:31:44] <chrisinajar> yeah, that's totally wrong.
[14:31:50] <jcrawford> ?
[14:31:56] <chrisinajar> whatever you're using to output it is escaping all the json characters
[14:32:19] <chrisinajar> you're probably using a toJson method of some sort twice, which is wrong
[14:32:20] <tash> eddiemonge: screw it, the actual code is here http://pastie.org/2726309 ... essentially, when I click on the thumb, I want to change an image somewhere ... so the first thing I want to know is, when I click on a thumb, what is that thumb's id?
[14:33:13] <chrisinajar> jcrawford: think of it like html encoding. if you do it twice, you end up with double encoded. you have double encoded json here. the object contains the literal string value of a json object instead of an actual json object.
[14:33:28] <jcrawford> ohh
[14:33:40] <jcrawford> now i know what is going on, now that you said that
[14:33:40] <jcrawford> :D
[14:34:04] <jcrawford> i think anyway
[14:34:11] <jcrawford> looking thanks for pointing that out'
[14:34:36] <chrisinajar> i believe in you. it should look like "users": ["id": "100.......
[14:35:51] <catcher> eddiemonge, the html markup is less than helpful..

[14:39:30] <argodk> no
[14:39:33] <node_js> textbox are not getting created
[14:39:43] <chrisinajar> argodk: then no
[14:39:45] <context> argodk: its probably not correct if it doesnt work
[14:39:52] <context> just a thought
[14:40:00] <argodk> oh
[14:40:23] <argodk> That’s not what I meant
[14:40:32] <argodk> What I meant was, did I correctly add what chrisinajar said
[14:40:57] <argodk> if I did, then what chrisinajar suggested is wrong
[14:41:09] <context> well your $() selector is wrong
[14:41:15] <argodk> ok
[14:41:30] <context> "check" || "uncheck" ALWAYS returns "check"
[14:41:39] <context> i see no tag called <check>
[14:42:03] <argodk> I’m using the id from the a link
[14:42:08] <fission6> is there an idea way to format a chunk of html with jquery and populate variables or format the html chunk
[14:42:17] <chrisinajar> argodk: perhaps you should explain what you're trying to do first
[14:42:19] <node_js> chrisinajar: can u look into, http://jsfiddle.net/Vbmjv/4/
[14:42:43] <argodk> chrisinajar I want the javascript function to run when I click the link
[14:42:51] <context> i like how everyone always asks specific people for help
[14:43:18] <chrisinajar> node_js: you're doing many things wrong here. one, you're missing a close });, two you have no #holder so it wont do anything, three i don't think adding elements like that works
[14:43:34] <chrisinajar> context: i've answered the last like 10 consecutive questions so now i'm getting popular :P
[14:43:46] <context> chrisinajar: ;)
[14:43:55] <eddiemonge> did people respond to me or have questions?
[14:43:57] <chrisinajar> context: i kind of want to go play HoN though..
[14:44:06] <context> node_js: this is why people use proper indentation. to notice simple errors like this
[14:44:19] <context> node_js: and use your web developer tools in your browser. they give you useful error messages
[14:44:21] <chrisinajar> node_js: i second what context said.
[14:44:31] <chrisinajar> both of those things
[14:44:55] <argodk> I want it so that when I click the link, a function runs based on the id in the link
[14:45:05] <context> chrisinajar: but he does have a #holder :x
[14:45:11] <argodk> I was following an example, but I must have misunderstood
[14:45:28] <context> argodk: yes. and you are 'close' kind of
[14:45:36] <context> id selector is '#id-name'
[14:45:38] <context> not 'name'
[14:45:50] <chrisinajar> context: oh, i was looking at revision 3
[14:45:51] <argodk> ok
[14:45:55] <node_js> context: i have holder

[14:48:18] * chrisinajar goes to play some HoN
[14:50:03] <eddiemonge> argodk: did you get it resolved?
[14:50:24] <argodk> eddiemonge no but I’m rewriting the code
[14:51:15] <argodk> what about this: http://pastebin.com/rm6rGSz7
[14:51:47] <eddiemonge> why cant you use jsfiddle?
[14:52:14] <argodk> oh nice I didn’t know about that
[14:52:21] <eddiemonge> argodk: why are you doing inline js? thats evil
[14:52:22] <tash> eddiemonge: going back to my example and what I want to accomplish ...
[14:54:01] <tash> if I have several thumbnails, and a matching big screenshot that matches up with each thumbnail ... right now, I'm displaying 1.png and under it are 1_thumb.png, 2_thumb.png, 3_thumb.png and 4_thumb.png ... when I click on 2_thumb.png I want 2.png to display in the div where 1.png is
[14:54:20] <eddiemonge> tash:  my script didnt work?
[14:54:24] <techsoldaten> I have a question: I need to pass a javascript array through a form
[14:54:24] <tash> no
[14:54:31] <techsoldaten> wondering what the best way to do it is
[14:54:36] <tash> didn't console.log anything
[14:55:21] <argodk> eddiemonge http://jsfiddle.net/6PysN/1/
[14:55:36] <eddiemonge> ?serializearray @ techsoldaten
[14:55:36] <bot-t> techsoldaten, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[14:55:45] <techsoldaten> yeah, that's form elements
[14:55:45] <muszek> hi... I have a problem.  When I have two checkboxes.  First one gets a checked="checked" attribute either directly in html or by .attr('checked','checked'); the second one is not checked (does not have this attribute).  Later on I click multiple times on both and get the value of $(this).attr('checked'); While the second one behaves OK (the value toggles between undefined and 'checked'), the first one always returns value "checked" (even if it's not).  What
[14:55:45] <muszek>  am I doing wrong?  Maybe I should check something else and not attr('checked')?
[14:55:46] <eddiemonge> tash: did you edit it to match your output?
[14:56:06] <techsoldaten> I am looking to take a javascript array and turn it into a value for a hidden form field
[14:56:24] <techsoldaten> serializearray won't do that, and the array is too complex for toString
[14:56:43] <ajpiano> ?stringify
[14:56:43] <bot-t> JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[14:57:33] <argodk> eddiemonge I updated it here: http://jsfiddle.net/6PysN/4/
[14:57:36] <tash> eddiemonge: did you see this? http://pastie.org/2726309
[14:58:04] <eddiemonge> tash:  that doesnt tell me anything. use jsfiddle.net and put the actual outputted code there
[14:58:11] <tash> if I could get the id of the thing I click on, I could .html the code into the div above I think
[14:58:26] <eddiemonge> argodk: what are you trying to do exactly?
[14:58:49] <argodk> eddiemonge I want it so when I click the link, it runs the function and pops up a message box

[15:03:34] <eddiemonge> node_js: lol bot-t is a bot
[15:03:46] <node_js> haha
[15:03:51] <eddiemonge> argodk: so what was the problem then?
[15:04:38] <node_js> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/tkMHe/ still not working
[15:05:07] <argodk> eddiemonge this is how I had it typed out earlier: http://jsfiddle.net/6PysN/4/
[15:05:16] <argodk> errr
[15:05:18] <argodk> sorry wrong link
[15:05:23] <argodk> http://pastebin.com/5HgC3AWz
[15:06:29] <argodk> thank you for helping, eddiemonge
[15:07:07] <eddiemonge> argodk: eww thats disgusting
[15:07:39] <argodk> lol
[15:09:35] <eddiemonge> thats nothing like i showed
[15:10:04] <argodk> no but that was the way i was originally going, such as using $(.class)
[15:10:19] <argodk> and then I switched it up to just have it do an onclick=function();
[15:11:11] <node_js> eddiemonge: the same code i copy pasted, its not working, http://jsfiddle.net/tkMHe/2/
[15:11:59] <eddiemonge> node_js: you needed to select jquery on the left http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/tkMHe/3/
[15:14:13] <node_js> thanks, eddiemonge
[15:16:59] <argodk> eddiemonge, why doesn’t the alert come up here? http://jsfiddle.net/6PysN/6/
[15:19:47] <eddiemonge> argodk: same thing i told node_js
[15:20:05] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/6PysN/9/
[15:20:41] <argodk> oh ok thanks
[15:21:00] <jbelcher> Hi all—balking at this design: I have a <img> that is a tracking beacon. For each tracking event I need to swap out its src, but I want to make sure the previous request has loaded before I do that. Any thoughts on the best way to do that? Flags w/ .load() deferring? Some sort of a queue and a timer to flush it?
[15:21:14] <argodk> I was about to go crazy lol. sorry for asking very basic questions. I’m going to read more on basic javascript. See ya
[15:22:02] <coldhead> w3schools

[15:23:28] <coldhead> it has a nice font
[15:23:33] <diggan> http://w3fools.com/
[15:23:57] <coldhead> cool, this font is even better
[15:24:01] <coldhead> thanks dig
[15:24:48] <ShaunR> whenever i create dialogs using the jqueryui the first button is always selected/highlighted when the dialog opens, how can i stop this from happening?
[15:27:05] <coldhead> don't create a dialog?
[15:28:10] <coldhead> ShaunR: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4731
[15:28:17] <coldhead> looks like it's an open bug
[15:34:42] <node_js> eddiemonge: i am getting the text boxes, but when i submit its values are not getting submitted
[15:35:55] <ShaunR> coldhead: lol, 2 years ago/
[15:36:53] <eddiemonge> node_js: you need to give the inputs unique names
[15:36:56] <coldhead> i don't care for UI :(
[15:37:04] <coldhead> BECAUSE IT DON'T CARE FOR ME
[15:38:56] <danielt> hi. I'm working on this site www.tcs-nz.co.nz and i'm having a problem where the script running the gallery keeps snapping the browser to the top of the page, making the content further down impossible to read, any kind folk with some hints out there?
[15:47:17] <danielt> hi. I'm working on this site www.tcs-nz.co.nz and i'm having a problem where the script running the gallery keeps snapping the browser to the top of the page, making the content further down impossible to read, any kind folk with some hints out there?
[15:47:29] <danielt> it's the fade gallery from jquery.com
[15:59:47] <node_js> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/qr7Y3/
[16:00:53] <andrewho> hey guys, im trying to figure this out.  im using the cycle plugin to fade images.  but it doesnt have an oncomplete function, is there anyway i can make one ?
[16:03:45] <andrewho> nevermind, theres an end option :)
[16:04:11] <Robbo_> I need to reverse a checkbox checked value on click but it just won't work for me... doing this..
[16:04:12] <Robbo_> var checked = $input.attr('checked'); $input.attr('checked', checked ? false : true);
[16:05:40] <Robbo_> Hmm just doing $input.attr('checked', false); doesn't even work :/
[16:05:40] <danielt> hi. I'm working on this site www.tcs-nz.co.nz and i'm having a problem where the script running the gallery keeps snapping the browser to the top of the page, making the content further down impossible to read, any kind folk with some hints out there?
[16:24:21] <mekwall> danielt: what plugin is that?
[16:26:30] <SinnerNyx> on the onload of an image, I have "var jiw=(jimg.width()==0)?jimg[0].width:jimg.width();" However this still sometimes returns zero. why is this the case?
[16:27:26] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: probably because the image was/is cached
[16:27:38] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: in what browser?
[16:27:48] <SinnerNyx> mekwall: when an image is cached it's height and width aren't loaded? chrome
[16:28:15] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: depends on when you are checking it :)
[16:28:28] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: is there a test case?
[16:28:46] <SinnerNyx> well the onload function does get triggered. i'll try to design a test case for you
[16:30:07] <friedbyte> can .append load html from an external file?
[16:31:11] <Fernandos> does jquery interfere with jquery mobile?
[16:31:31] <miketaylr> no
[16:31:34] <miketaylr> it's required by jquery mobile
[16:33:21] <mekwall> friedbyte: nope, use .load for that
[16:33:45] <Fernandos> ah ok
[16:33:54] <friedbyte> when I use .load are there restrictions to what file type I can load from?
[16:33:55] <Fernandos> thanks miketaylr
[16:33:58] <friedbyte> will it load .php files?
[16:36:15] <SinnerNyx> mekwall: http://jsfiddle.net/E2hWF/
[16:36:20] <SinnerNyx> the first time it's fine
[16:36:26] <SinnerNyx> but click on the image and it doesn't work anymore
[16:36:47] <friedbyte> it loads .php file, but it is replacing my content . . .
[16:36:48] <friedbyte> hmm
[16:37:07] <SinnerNyx> which leads me to believe that you are correct and it is a caching issue. but why would cached images have no width or height. i could almost understand the onload not triggering but it clearly does
[16:38:23] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: sounds like a cache issue ;)
[16:38:40] <SinnerNyx> i agree, but I still don't see how it can be resolved
[16:39:01] <coldhead> have you tried restarting the browser?
[16:39:07] <coldhead> that sometimes helps
[16:39:08] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: onload won't trigger when its cached I think
[16:39:30] <SinnerNyx> mekwall, as i just said, clearly the onload does get triggered as the alert keeps coming back
[16:39:48] <tash> I've got a <div> with a full image in it and thumbs below it ... when I click on a thumb below, I want the full image div above to change to the appropriate full image ... right now, when I click on a thumb it goes to a new page and displays only the thumb, how can I prevent the default behavior of the <a> and just stay on the same page and change the full image?  onclick do a .html to the full image div?
[16:40:22] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: well it works for me in chrome :P
[16:40:29] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: and in firefox 7, and in ie9
[16:40:32] <SinnerNyx> you see the length each time?
[16:41:04] <SinnerNyx> mekwall: ^^
[16:41:47] <SinnerNyx> mekwall: did you click on the image?
[16:41:48] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: 6600, yeah
[16:42:05] <mekwall> it does return 0 if the image hasn't finished loading though
[16:42:12] <mekwall> which is correct
[16:42:25] <SinnerNyx> mekwall, i'm confused, why would the image not finish loading when the onload handler is called?
[16:45:16] <miketaylr> because browsers suck
[16:45:21] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: not really sure what you are trying to do here
[16:46:11] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/E2hWF/1/
[16:46:16] <mekwall> how does that work for you?
[16:46:45] <SinnerNyx> mekwall, it works brilliantly
[16:46:54] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: heh, ok
[16:47:05] <SinnerNyx> so i guess jquery handles this inconsistency somehow
[16:47:10] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: well... that is more or less doing the same but in a more jQueryish way
[16:47:45] <mekwall> SinnerNyx: well jQuery is made to normalize a lot of the different behaviors and inconsistencies between browsers
[16:48:22] <mekwall> http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/E2hWF/2/
[16:48:27] <mekwall> can even do it like that if you want
[16:48:54] <SinnerNyx> mekwall, brilliant. thank you very much

[17:05:18] <danielt> mekwall. I also return the favor of helping people out in this channel, even if its a stupid or n00b question. If your not going to be helpful and you don't need help then shut up.
[17:05:55] <danielt> the channel is obviously dead, so i will repeat the question every now and then until i get some help, solve it myself or help someone else
[17:07:45] <mekwall> danielt: right. now I really dont want to help you at all.
[17:07:50] <mekwall> good luck
[17:08:09] <danielt> OH MY GOD NO!! ..douche
[17:15:28] <mekwall> cakehero: I was trying to help danielt :) I very rarely have questions, and when I do this is not the place to ask anyways
[17:15:52] <coldhead> how dare you, mekwall
[17:15:59] <coldhead> this is a wonderful place to ask

[17:17:01] <cakehero> ProLoser|Work they are flash but going to jQuery?
[17:17:17] <ProLoser|Work> no

[17:17:40] <ProLoser|Work> just looking for more djs
[17:17:42] <ProLoser|Work> :)
[17:18:10] <mekwall> ProLoser|Work: restricted to the us ... pah

[17:18:41] <ProLoser|Work> sorry dude :)
[17:18:44] <Es0teric> i have this problem here -> http://jsfiddle.net/gBffK/ as you can see, when the "turn on" link is clicked, it shows the overlay, but theres no method of actually turning it off
[17:19:11] <ProLoser|Work> what's a good jquery related interview question
[17:19:17] <johnywp> hello
[17:19:42] <johnywp> I am using a custom jquery code for an animation
[17:19:54] <johnywp> through putting the code within <script> .... </script>
[17:20:13] <johnywp> can you please tell me how to load it from an external file so that it doesn't get outputted on the actual pag?
[17:20:24] <Es0teric> update on my problem here -> http://jsfiddle.net/gBffK/1/
[17:20:42] <mekwall> Gardimuer: depends on the questions. what I meant is that the questions that I have (if I even have any at all) are such a high level that I need to talk directly to devs
[17:21:23] <Gardimuer> The question I have is very low-level and probably just a problem of me not understanding syntax.
[17:21:40] <mekwall> Gardimuer: then this is the perfect place to ask :)
[17:22:15] <mekwall> Gardimuer: that's also the reason why I am in here heh
[17:24:28] <DualDetroit> Oh, oh ohhhhhhhh YEAH YOU KNOW IT!!!!!!!
[17:24:53] <DualDetroit> D-D-D-D-D-D-Dual Detroit be in da hou-WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWw
[17:25:02] <Gardimuer> I'm trying to make a code that will change the last drop-down in a navigation list if the total width of all the drop-down titles is greater than a certain amount.
[17:25:11] <DualDetroit> -WWWW--- Sorry, I'll come in again.
[17:25:34] <DualDetroit> Dual Detroit be in da house!
[17:25:57] <Gardimuer> Here's an example of where I would apply it: http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Community_Central (the blue navigation tabs with drop-down lists)
[17:26:10] <Es0teric> ey can someone assist me with my problem real quick?
[17:26:40] <Gardimuer> And here's the fail-code I was trying to use: http://pastebin.com/dvmmHwzn
[17:26:40] <mekwall> Es0teric: ask it and see
[17:26:57] <Es0teric> i did ask it, mekwall... i even provided a jsfiddle link
[17:26:58] <Es0teric> :|
[17:26:59] <mekwall> Gardimuer: wow...
[17:27:18] <mekwall> Es0teric: indeed you did :) my bad
[17:27:31] <Es0teric> its coo, mekwall
[17:28:24] <mekwall> Es0teric: but... you didn't really ask a question and I cannot see how missing a way to turn it off is a problem - just a lack of functionality
[17:28:45] <Es0teric> mekwall, well i thought i had that functionalty in there.. and for some reason, it doesnt work
[17:28:50] <Es0teric> thats the whole point of the if/else
[17:28:53] <DualDetroit> MOTOWN MOTHAS IN THE MOTOR CITY, LISTEN UP -- OUR SPEAKERS ARE LARGE MADONNA'S VOICE IS IN CHARGE!!!!
[17:29:34] <DualDetroit> MOTOR CITY WILL DROP YO WITH A BASEKICK LIKE A VISACARD -- CAUSE WE GOT OUR BASS DEGREE FROM THE 313; IT'S OUR PHD!
[17:29:50] <DualDetroit> *Dual Detroit goes Dual Doctor on the floor* *swoof* *swoof*
[17:30:53] <Gardimuer> Es0teric: The div is obscuring the link in the ul, isn't it?
[17:31:36] <Es0teric> gardimuer -> http://jsfiddle.net/gBffK/1/
[17:31:41] <Es0teric> thats the updated one.. it isnt anymore
[17:33:08] <mekwall> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/gBffK/3/
[17:34:01] <Es0teric> mekwall, what if i want one without the e.preventDefault();? because the e.preventDefault(); stops the flash elements from loading..
[17:34:22] <mekwall> Es0teric: eh... what?
[17:34:45] <Es0teric> mekwall, e.preventDefault(); stops flash files from loading..
[17:34:47] <mekwall> Es0teric: preventDefault merely prevents default behavior... :P
[17:34:59] <mekwall> well then you're doing something else wrong
[17:35:42] <mekwall> Gardimuer: about your code... I don't really have the lust or mind to dig in to that atm... but to be fair and square, that code is utter rubbish :)
[17:35:43] <Es0teric> mekwall, ah i see...
[17:35:56] <Gardimuer> I figured ;)
[17:36:05] <Es0teric> mekwall, what if i want the overlay to disappear when the overlay is clicked OR when the "turn off" is clicked?
[17:36:11] * DualDetroit yeah, I'm kickin it down kickin it down -- with 10,000 pounds of steel on the Dancefloor in Detroit Motor City.
[17:36:13] <Es0teric> *turn on
[17:36:38] <mekwall> Gardimuer: not trying to be an ass here, but you are repeating selectors like a mad man and it doesn't make much sense
[17:36:41] <johnywp> i wrote a jquery code to make an animation
[17:36:54] <johnywp> if i put it within <script> tags into my header, it works
[17:37:03] <mekwall> Gardimuer: if you have the time and interest I suggest you take a look at http://jqfundamentals.com/
[17:37:10] <johnywp> now I am trying to load it from an external file to clean up the page
[17:37:29] <mekwall> Gardimuer: that might help you get a better understanding at how it's supposed to be done ;)
[17:37:30] <Gardimuer> I welcome any criticism on this matter. I know next to nothing about JavaScript/jQuery.
[17:38:20] <mekwall> Es0teric: just add another handler for $lights
[17:38:24] <johnywp> if i just replace <script> with "function animation() {" and </script> with "}" and then save this into a .js file, and in my header, I just load the js file and do <script> function animation() </script> would it work?
[17:38:55] <mekwall> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/gBffK/4/
[17:39:38] <Es0teric> mekwall, OHH i see ok ok
[17:40:14] <mekwall> Es0teric: I would probably abstract it even more
[17:40:49] <Es0teric> mekwall, what do you mean by that?
[17:42:21] <johnywp> anyone?
[17:42:27] <johnywp> if i just replace <script> with "function animation() {" and </script> with "}" and then save this into a .js file, and in my header, I just load the js file and do <script> function animation() </script> would it work?
[17:43:21] <mekwall> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/gBffK/5/
[17:43:29] <ajpiano> and then the johnywp you don't have to put the function wrapper around it
[17:43:40] <ajpiano> johnywp: just put the contents of the script in a .js file and include
[17:43:43] <ajpiano> and they will be executed just the same
[17:43:46] <mekwall> Es0teric: that might give you a little idea of how it could work ;)
[17:44:04] <Es0teric> mekwall, that one is more efficient
[17:44:27] <kborchers> johnywp: also, then you wouldn't declare the function again in your file ... you would just call animation();
[17:44:31] <mekwall> Es0teric: can be made even more efficient, based on what you are actually after
[17:44:54] <Es0teric> mekwall, i am not after something fancy
[17:44:57] <Es0teric> so that will do.. thanks
[17:45:06] <mekwall> Es0teric: alright
[17:46:07] <johnywp> so <script> animation(); </script?
[17:47:21] <mekwall> time for bed
[17:47:22] <mekwall> cya
[17:47:40] <coldhead> goodnight meksy
[17:48:18] <kborchers> johnywp: sure, assuming your function is properly defined in the js file
[17:48:39] <kborchers> also, since you're animating something you may need to see ?ready
[17:48:40] <bot-t> also, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[17:49:07] <johnywp> YES! it works :D thank you!
[17:49:17] <kborchers> np
[17:52:54] <Fernandos> hmm any idea why the theme option doesn't have an effect? see http://jsfiddle.net/gVR8P/
[17:53:28] <Fernandos> when I add data-theme="e" to the select tag, then it switches the theme only..
[17:54:45] <Fernandos> it's jquery mobile
[17:54:58] <Fernandos> I hope it's ok asking here for it
[18:02:57] <Fernandos> I thought this $('select').selectmenu({'nativeMenu': 'false', 'theme': 'e'}); changes the theme..but it's not working in that example above, do I do something wrong?  
[18:11:31] <depressed> Hello
[18:11:32] <rickup> seen nail_?
[18:11:40] <rickup> seen _nail?
[18:12:48] <kborchers> Fernandos: i believe you need to do .selectmenu("refresh"); after you modify the select
[18:15:00] <Fernandos> kborchers: ok, then I can't explain why this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/gVR8P/2/
[18:15:12] <Fernandos> I've added the refresh now
[18:15:15] <Fernandos> without effect
[18:19:40] <Fernandos> kborchers: do you have an idea? I've tried a lot and can't get it to apply the new theme, except by adding the data attribute through hmtl
[18:21:56] <kborchers> Fernandos: sorry, not sure. haven't done a whole lot with mobile yet myself. have you tried #jquerymobile?
[18:22:18] <Fernandos> oh I didn't know of that channel. thanks kborchers
[18:29:25] <safire_> I'm having a lot of trouble navigating the jquery documentation
[18:29:44] <safire_> using selector.each to iterate through all my email objects
[18:29:57] <safire_> where can I find a list of methods I can call on these objects that relate to html tags
[18:30:34] <danzik171> Fernandos: are you trying to change the style in response to something or is that just how you want it from the start?
[18:30:57] <Fernandos> danzik171: that's how I want it from the start
[18:32:06] <danzik171> Fernandos: http://jsfiddle.net/gVR8P/6/
[18:32:15] <danzik171> you don't need to do that on ready or anything, just use attributes
[18:33:11] <Fernandos> danzik171: yeah I got that already working with attributes, but then I don't get why that option doesn't work for jquery :/
[18:33:21] <b1lly> how do i empty an array?
[18:33:38] <danzik171> Fernandos: it only refreshes the list when you programmatically change the selected item, not any of the styles (per the docs)
[18:34:12] <holodoc> b1lly: myArray = []
[18:34:57] <Fernandos> danzik171: what are those options then for, if I may ask? :) http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/selects/options.html
[18:35:02] <depressed> http://code.google.com/p/jscrollpane/ can this be used on the body tag?
[18:35:46] <kborchers> b1lly: http://goo.gl/hJNmZ
[18:35:55] <Fernandos> depressed: you can hide the scrollbar yes. and use that instead
[18:36:13] <danzik171> Fernandos: no idea.  presumably maybe if you use the data-role="none" attribute and want to create it later?
[18:36:25] <danzik171> or dynamically append a select later and want it styled?
[18:36:47] <Fernandos> weird..

[18:37:29] <Fernandos> it's just that I'm used to add params to "configure" a jquery plugin, jquery mobile seems to be different then.. no idea really.
[18:37:42] <Fernandos> but thanks a lot for helping danzik171 appreciated :)
[18:37:46] <ryanneufeld> Fernandos: jquery mobile is different
[18:37:56] <rickup> Hey all I had some help from someone in here (you know who you are) and it got me past a really difficult spot on this form... Now I need a little more help with it http://pastebin.com/54EK9AaP  I had to force both a page refresh and I call this other function I found online to also clear the form.  That is fine when someone changes a plan.  However when someone picks the plan it "does not look right" according to the powers that be.  S
[18:37:56] <rickup> o... if there is a way to only have it clear form and refresh page when you truly "change plans" instead "first selecting one plan" that would be great.  Thanks..
[18:37:56] <ryanneufeld> you have to configure it using their init method
[18:38:08] <Dave_Stein> can't wait for ui2 where mobile will be folded into it
[18:38:28] <danzik171> ui2 is going to incorporate mobile?  hrmm?
[18:38:43] <Dave_Stein> that's what gonzalez said
[18:39:01] <Fernandos> Dave_Stein: sounds good, ui and mobile marriage hehe
[18:39:23] <rickup> The link to the form in question is http://www.cloudvirtualoffices.com/locations/beverly-hills  and the code from the pastebin is in the html page source
[18:39:34] <ryanneufeld> Fernandos: I've used mobile a fair bit, what are you trying to do? I just joined so don't have history
[18:39:48] <Dave_Stein> i really can't wait - so much so i started the fork and branch and am actively working on it ;)
[18:40:20] <danzik171> eh unfortunately mobile was no bueno for me :(   too many blackberry 5.0 users.
[18:40:20] <Fernandos> ah np, it's actually a simple change of the theme, but not through the data-theme attribute, but with jquery code. this was one of my attempts http://jsfiddle.net/gVR8P/2/
[18:41:09] <Fernandos> danzik171: haha aren't the blackberry services still down? (I've a blackberry..unfortunately)
[18:41:43] <Fernandos> danzik171: how did you solve it then without jquery mobile?
[18:41:43] <ryanneufeld> Fernandos: so you want to change the theme programatically then?
[18:41:46] <danzik171> dunno, i don't pick the one i have up unless its to spot check something
[18:41:51] <Dave_Stein> black what? people use those?
[18:41:51] <Dave_Stein> ha
[18:41:53] <Fernandos> ryanneufeld: exactly
[18:42:12] <Fernandos> Dave_Stein: it was a gift ;)
[18:42:16] <danzik171> Fernandos: i cheated.  i created the page using jquery mobile and figured out what their generated HTML was for to get the styles that i wanted
[18:42:18] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: only when the network is up
[18:42:25] <thinkclay> slightly stupid question, but how do I get a regex match to work with a var as part of my pattern? i want to match a string thats set to var foo in another string.
[18:42:25] <danzik171> then i just took that and am using their CSS, but not their JS.
[18:42:32] <ryanneufeld> Fernandos: I think I know how to do that
[18:42:47] <lng> hi! how do I AJAX against user's input after some delay?
[18:42:49] <Fernandos> danzik171: I was thinking that you wrote a native app, but that's clever ;) thumbs up
[18:42:51] <Dave_Stein> thinkclay: you need to use new RegExp if you want to use a variable to set a word in your regex
[18:43:09] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: poor RIM
[18:43:09] <thinkclay> Dave: can you give me just a quick example to get me started?
[18:43:24] <danzik171> Fernandos: no, i don't want to deal with the nightmare of managing application upgrades =P  i don't need access to any native APIs, so this works fine
[18:43:40] <Dave_Stein> thinkclay: yeah let me fiddle that
[18:43:57] <lng> there suppose to be some plugin for that
[18:44:18] <lng> not for AJAX but for delaying...
[18:44:46] <ryanneufeld> Fernandos: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc2/docs/api/events.html
[18:44:49] <ryanneufeld> that's your first hint
[18:45:30] <Fernandos> danzik171: mobile framewroks become an ubiquity and there are some "frameworks" where very basic skills like html are enough to create native apps for different mobile phones at once in the cloud
[18:45:53] <Dave_Stein> thinkckay: http://jsfiddle.net/q7dv5/
[18:45:56] <Dave_Stein> that took me too long, am a bit tired
[18:46:16] <thinkclay> Dave: Thanks a bunch!
[18:46:23] <Dave_Stein> regexp takes a second argument you might want where its a string 'gi'
[18:46:28] <Dave_Stein> where g means global and i means insensitive
[18:46:34] <Dave_Stein> and i believe u is multiline
[18:46:39] <Dave_Stein> i forgot, depends on language for that one
[18:47:15] <depressed> Fernandos: it doesn't work for the body tag
[18:47:28] <Fernandos> Dave_Stein: oh..that reminds me that I've to write a lexer for next week :/ gotta check the regexes again..you've to use them from time to time to not forget them
[18:47:29] <depressed> it requires a separate div for the scrollbars
[18:48:02] <lng> how to track user has stopped typing to form input?
[18:48:09] <Fernandos> depressed: oh, I just meant that you can disable the scrollbars globaly and enabled the jscrollpane ones, where you I think need a wrapper for the scrollbar skin
[18:48:19] <Dave_Stein> Fernandos: I have to use regex way too often and I'm the only person in office that knows regex out of 8
[18:48:25] <Dave_Stein> some people know it a bit at most
[18:48:35] <depressed> Fernandos: never mind boss, found the article http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/jScrollPane/fullBodyScroll.html
[18:48:55] <Fernandos> Dave_Stein: haha you lucky ;) it's actually not as hard as it appears, it just takes a bit until it makes click
[18:48:57] <Dave_Stein> lng: You can set a timeout on keyup and see that the value of field a half second later matches what it was on last keyup or something like that
[18:49:08] <Fernandos> I'd say it depends on who explains it
[18:49:11] <Dave_Stein> Fernandos: I just forget how to properly use \1 lookbacks since i so rarely use it
[18:50:15] <Fernandos> Dave_Stein: yesteraday I need to match a word in my editor to remove all stuff between "" in src="http://bla.bla.com" and I forgot if it was /w or \w haha ;)
[18:50:41] <lng> Dave_Stein: thanks
[18:50:57] <Dave_Stein> couldnt you just do src="[^"]+", src="MINE"
[18:51:07] <Fernandos> idk I used src="[a-zA-Z0-9\:\/\.\_\-]*"
[18:51:34] <Dave_Stein> shorter is better although i hoenstly don't know which would run faster
[18:51:35] <Fernandos> oh that's smart ^^
[18:51:46] <Dave_Stein> i'd imagine mine since it's just saying not that character instead of checking against multiples
[18:51:54] <Dave_Stein> #toolazyforjsperf
[18:52:05] <Fernandos> true. true.
[18:52:20] <Dave_Stein> but its rare for regex time to actually impact me
[18:53:13] <Fernandos> last month I'd to math all valid domains+tld. but you know the tlds change.. so I used curl to get them and matched against them
[18:53:32] <Fernandos> it was for a single sign on story
[18:55:29] <Dave_Stein> tld? two level domain?
[18:56:34] <Fernandos> it could be ww.zoo.co.uk too
[18:56:40] <Fernandos> or zoo.custom
[18:56:46] <Dave_Stein> ah yeah
[18:56:54] <safire_> is it possible for me to select the parent element with the class name "hidable"?
[18:57:00] <Fernandos> idk you probably heard that icann decided to allow custom tlds..
[18:57:09] <safire_> given an arbitrary jquery object
[18:57:11] <Dave_Stein> safire_: $('#el').closest( '.hidable' );
[18:57:17] <safire_> thanks!
[18:57:18] <Dave_Stein> ?closest @ safire_
[18:57:19] <bot-t> safire_, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[19:01:09] <Fernandos> ryanneufeld: hmm like this? http://jsfiddle.net/gVR8P/12/ I guess I'm still  on the wrong path?
[19:02:19] <ryanneufeld> I think you're on  the right path
[19:02:20] <Dave_Stein> oh selectmenu
[19:02:22] <Dave_Stein> i hate you
[19:02:25] <Dave_Stein> what is your problem?
[19:02:30] <ryanneufeld> but there seems to be something else wrong  here
[19:02:41] <ryanneufeld> Dave_Stein: setting the theme on it after render
[19:02:56] <ryanneufeld> so .selectmenu({theme:"e"});
[19:03:00] <ryanneufeld> for example
[19:03:03] <ryanneufeld> does SFA
[19:03:10] <ryanneufeld> even from the JS console
[19:03:26] <Dave_Stein> ohhh we don't use the themes, we just have our own css based on the selectors always :P
[19:03:34] <ryanneufeld> and the pageinit event just isn't happening
[19:03:57] <ryanneufeld> Dave_Stein: you one of the mobile devs?
[19:04:07] <Dave_Stein> nope
[19:04:10] <Dave_Stein> not yet at least
[19:04:11] <ryanneufeld> oh
[19:04:39] <Fernandos> maybe because Stein is popular surename
[19:04:40] <ryanneufeld> when you say we?
[19:04:51] <ryanneufeld> who do you mean?
[19:04:55] <Dave_Stein> ohhh behance :)
[19:05:36] <Dave_Stein> im new to being a UI dev, but am nowhere near mobile... at least not yet
[19:05:53] <Dave_Stein> and selectmenu isn't even official is it?  i thought it's just on git in a random repo?
[19:06:08] <kborchers> selectmenu in mobile is what he means
[19:06:14] <Dave_Stein> ahhh
[19:06:20] <Dave_Stein> *mind explosion*
[19:06:39] <Fernandos> *shakes*
[19:06:44] <dandaman1> hi all, I'm using the mask plugin for dates and have this, $("#terminationDate").mask("(0[1-9]|1[012])/(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])/(1900-2500)");
[19:06:45] <Dave_Stein> im gonna go back to playing Fling
[19:06:47] <Dave_Stein> so stuck on this level
[19:06:50] <dandaman1> am i misusing that regex?
[19:06:52] <Fernandos> it won't play for me :/
[19:07:04] <dandaman1> terminationDate is an input field of type texty
[19:07:07] <dandaman1> text*
[19:08:01] <dandaman1> perhaps / have some use that i'm not aware of
[19:08:39] <Fernandos> ryanneufeld: are you referring to the jsfiddle when you said it works for you in the console?
[19:08:45] <ryanneufeld> yes
[19:08:50] <ryanneufeld> if you ad /show to the url
[19:08:51] <Fernandos> all I get is TypeError: Cannot call method 'selectmenu' of null
[19:08:55] <ryanneufeld> oh
[19:08:58] <Fernandos> yeah right
[19:09:05] <ryanneufeld> then use the console there
[19:09:54] <Fernandos> in the console $('select').selectmenu({theme:"e"}); will not change anything
[19:10:08] <Fernandos> tried it
[19:10:39] <ryanneufeld> Fernandos: I think you're hosed
[19:10:58] <ryanneufeld> seems that changing the theme doesn't work
[19:11:06] <Fernandos> haha yeah
[19:11:36] <ryanneufeld> I'm just checking out the latest git
[19:11:44] <ryanneufeld> gonna have a look at the code
[19:11:53] <danzik171> ryanneufeld: it works, just got it to =P
[19:11:55] <Fernandos> I'll have to add the html attribute, it wasn't required, but it would be usefull to be able to use the options instead
[19:12:08] <Fernandos> danzik171: how so?
[19:12:14] <danzik171> http://jsfiddle.net/gVR8P/15/
[19:13:03] <Fernandos> ah you binded it to pagecreate not pageinit and added the outer div..
[19:13:13] <Fernandos> danzik171: cool thanks man!
[19:13:16] <danzik171> pagecreate replaced pageinit
[19:13:17] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[19:13:21] <danzik171> but that actually wasn't the key
[19:13:31] <ryanneufeld> when did that happen
[19:13:42] <ryanneufeld> the current docs say use page init instead of doc ready
[19:13:50] <Fernandos> how'd I know, my first jq mobile project. I used another framework for the last project..
[19:13:50] <danzik171> change jsfiddle to run the script in no wrap (head)
[19:14:55] <danzik171> ah i had it backwards anyway, it's pageinit
[19:15:01] <danzik171> google is linking to the freaking beta docs.
[19:15:11] <ryanneufeld> Fernandos: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/gVR8P/17/
[19:15:13] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[19:15:17] <ryanneufeld> pageinit is the way to go
[19:15:43] <ryanneufeld> the thing to watch out for though is that it seems to be calling it twice
[19:15:58] <ryanneufeld> I'm getting multiple alerts
[19:16:28] <Fernandos> yeah works that way http://jsfiddle.net/gVR8P/18/
[19:17:03] <Fernandos> cool glad you figured it out danzik171 will note that somewhere so I remember it :)
[19:18:44] <Fernandos> it's a onepage checkout page that I'm doing btw. you've a grid of products that you can drag around and the left area of a product will show an option dialog where you can select size,color etc and on the right side you can add it to the cart and. clicking it will show a gallery on the same page
[19:19:18] <Fernandos> similar a bit to https://www.paypal-deutschland.de/shops/
[19:19:42] <Fernandos> paypal does a/b testing, refresh if you don't see an orange price badge
[19:21:55] <ryanneufeld> so what is it that you're need to change the theme for like that?
[19:22:41] <Fernandos> it's not because of the them, I needed to pass arguments to the shopping cart and needed to change the look to fit to the style
[19:22:51] <Fernandos> s/them/theme
[19:23:55] <Fernandos> it even works without the two wrappers data-role="page" and data-role="content"
[19:26:51] <Dave_Stein> time to go home
[19:27:24] <lng> can I optimize it somehow? http://paste.ubuntu.com/713796/
[19:27:52] <danzik171> trying to build jquery on windows instead of cygwin (with ant) and i'm getting build.xml doesn't exist - anyone know the right flags to pass to ant?
[19:32:34] <ngharo> you need make, not ant
[19:33:08] <danzik171> ngharo: yea, just realized that from the git site - the actual docs page on jquery.com is outdated
[19:33:12] <danzik171> still says you can use ant
[19:33:33] <ngharo> ahh
[19:34:11] <Fernandos> in the Makefile you'll see which params get passed to ant
[19:36:14] <lng> can I combine these two $(document).ready somehow? http://paste.ubuntu.com/713796/
[19:36:49] <danzik171> it worked well enough just adding cygwin dirs to the PATH though, don't need to load up cygwin to build now which was my goal.
[19:36:53] <Fernandos> ing maybe $(document).ready(function() { }).ready(init); I'm not sure
[19:37:36] <danzik171> $(document).ready() { init(); } ? =P
[19:37:54] <lng> :-)
[19:37:59] <danzik171> horribly bad syntax, but yes.
[19:39:08] <lng> Fernandos: that work
[19:39:44] <lng> so we can have as many calls like that?
[19:39:48] <tash1> man, I could really use some help ... trying to "refresh" an image on my page.  Imagine a gallery that shows a main image, then several thumbnails under it.  If I click on a thumbnail, I want the main image to change to the full size of the thumbnail I just clicked.  Essentially, I want to change the src="" of my image and "reload" the page.  But, I want it to appear to the user as though the page didn't refresh...pointers?
[19:40:18] <Fernandos> hi tash1
[19:40:59] <tash1> hey Fernandos :) You are also in concrete5, no?
[19:41:06] <Fernandos> indeed
[19:41:06] <tash1> maybe a different Fernandos
[19:41:10] <tash1> sup!
[19:41:27] <Fernandos> tired.. but yeah
[19:41:44] <tash1> yeah, I'm not tired yet and would really like to figure this out =\ any tips?
[19:42:30] <Fernandos> it's not making sense to me. you want ajax but you don't want it?
[19:42:38] <Fernandos> hmm
[19:42:47] <Fernandos> it sounds like the galleria addon to me
[19:42:54] <tash> heh ... if I led you to believe I don't want ajax...I'm sorry
[19:43:03] <tash> I want to click on a thumbnail and make the full image change
[19:43:15] <notbenh1> hello all, I am wondering if $(selector).bind() only attaches event handlers to existing matches? or is it possible to bind events to the selector such that when future elements enter the dom that would be selected then they have said event attached?
[19:43:27] <notbenh1> I tried to find something about this in the docs and it was not very clear
[19:43:36] <notbenh1> though I am kinda looking for something that's a bit odd
[19:43:41] <kborchers> tash: just use the click event on the thumbs to update the src attr of the main image
[19:43:44] <kborchers> ?click @ tash
[19:43:45] <bot-t> tash, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[19:43:48] <kborchers> ?attr @ tash
[19:43:49] <bot-t> tash, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[19:43:50] <Fernandos> tash: did you write that gallery yourself or is it a plugin?
[19:44:22] <tash> Fernandos: I wrote it ... nothing fancy, just some PHP that is parsing xml and such
[19:44:34] <tash> kborchers:  you say it as if it is so easy :) I shall read
[19:45:13] <Fernandos> $("#target").click({ $(this).parents("img").attribute(...) });
[19:45:35] <kborchers> Fernandos: pretty much just attr not attribute
[19:45:48] <Fernandos> oh yeah
[19:45:49] <kborchers> probably not parents either
[19:46:01] <kborchers> just give the main image an id and make life easier ;)
[19:46:14] <Fernandos> nah parents is correct. it's 5 in the morning though
[19:46:54] <kborchers> that assumes that the main image is a parent of the thumbs ... which i doubt
[19:47:02] <Fernandos> yeah idk his html structure, could guss around but that's basically how you do it
[19:48:15] <Fernandos> kborchers: could happen something like <div id="gallery">...images.. <div id="thumnails">..thumbs..</div> </div>
[19:48:38] <Fernandos> kborchers: but I won't guess around, let's tash figure this out
[19:49:13] <tash> I had this: $('#screenshot').attr('src', '<img src="<?=$scrnshts?>/<?=$nodes->images->image[0]?>" />' );
[19:49:18] <tash> sorry, stepped away for a minute
[19:50:04] <tash> inside a $(".thumb").click( function() { }
[19:52:15] <kborchers> tash: i'll ignore the ugly mixture of php and js ;) and say it may work if you do $('#screenshot').attr('src', '<?=$scrnshts?>/<?=$nodes->images->image[0]?>' ); assuming that gives you the correct image path
[19:53:06] <kborchers> tash: basically you are just replacing the src attr, not the whole img tag
[19:53:31] <Es0teric> does anyone here know how to use jquery.scrollTo()?
[19:54:37] <tash> heh ... yeah, sorry about the ughly combo ... assuming that I didn't mix php with js, it'd be $('#screenshot)'.attr('src', '/my/path/file.png'); yeah?
[19:55:21] <tash> er... minus the typo of my apostrophe outside the screenshot closing )
[19:55:50] <kborchers> looks right
[19:57:14] <ShaunR> with $.ajax() what happens if the response is blank or not JSON when dataType is set to json?
[19:57:16] <tash> yeah, I replaced all my php stuff with straight up path and it showed up ... now I gotta figure out how to incorporate my php stuff
[20:07:04] <Es0teric> does anyone know how to make the jquery scrollTo() plugin work?
[20:09:31] <notbenh1> ok I'm stumped. does .load(url) ever trip an even after the fact?
[20:10:09] <notbenh1> it seems that $(selector).load(url).ready(function(){console.info('done')})); half works
[20:10:18] <notbenh1> or rather the load does what I expect, but ready is never tripped
[20:10:55] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking at this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#sortable and i'm wondering if there is an easy way to only allow one instance of the draggable to be added to the sortable
[20:11:03] <ryanneufeld> anyone have any ideas?
[20:11:04] <notbenh1> I was the one asking about the selector <-> event relationship due to not being able to figure out how to trap a load's done state
[20:11:10] <kborchers> notbenh1: you want to use the complete callback i.e. $(selector).load(url, function(..... see ?load
[20:11:11] <bot-t> notbenh1, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[20:11:26] <notbenh1> kborchers: ahhhh
[20:11:27] <kborchers> wrong one
[20:11:53] <kborchers> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:13:23] <notbenh1> kborchers: perfect that was it, thanks
[20:13:45] <kborchers> np
[20:14:21] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: what if you used something like the sortable's receive event to destroy the draggable
[20:14:32] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[20:14:37] <ryanneufeld> destroy in what way?
[20:14:39] <ryanneufeld> disable?
[20:14:56] <kborchers> draggable("destroy");
[20:15:03] <kborchers> makes it nolonger a draggable
[20:15:21] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[20:15:36] <ShaunR> is there a simple way to reload a page.. for example i want to do a post and then on success i want the current page to reload
[20:15:39] <ryanneufeld> so in the receive, do ui.draggable("destroy");
[20:15:43] <ryanneufeld> I'll try that
[20:16:09] <kborchers> it would be ("theDraggable").draggable("destroy");
[20:17:21] <kborchers> ShaunR: window.location.reload();
[20:17:38] <Es0teric> how would jquery .scrollTop() work?
[20:18:01] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[20:18:12] <Es0teric> is it $('#id').scrollTop($('#id_of_element_to_scroll_to')); ?

[20:19:12] <eddiemonge>  ?scrolltop @ Es0teric
[20:19:15] <kborchers> Es0teric: no, you have to provide a number to add to the scrollTop ... you could use offset or position depending on your layout to get the number you need there see ?offset

[20:19:21] <coldhead> that's a powerful euphemism, ryanneufeld
[20:19:49] <ryanneufeld> it was giving me form validation errors...
[20:19:53] <Es0teric> kborchers, so then how do i scroll to a div?
[20:19:57] <ryanneufeld> refresh, repaste in my code
[20:19:59] <ryanneufeld> works now
[20:20:00] <ryanneufeld> strange
[20:20:12] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: yes, it is, it's my go to

It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[20:20:16] <kborchers> Es0teric: i just told you
[20:20:38] <Es0teric> kborchers, i have the scrollTo plugin.. but i dont know how to make it work - i saw the demo but i still dont understand it
[20:20:47] <kborchers> never used it
[20:22:15] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: do you have id's in your script? if so, the easiest way is "window.location = '#elementid'
[20:22:39] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, yes i have id's in my scropt
[20:22:53] <kborchers> eddiemonge: that's cheating ;)
[20:23:01] <eddiemonge> kborchers: i know
[20:23:04] <kborchers> heh
[20:23:24] <eddiemonge> figured getting it to work in the jquery way would take forever
[20:23:37] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, i have the scrollTo script
[20:23:42] <Es0teric> but i dont know how to make it work
[20:23:59] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: did you even read what i put?
[20:24:00] <ngharo> huh? that works for reals?  window.location = '#id'
[20:24:06] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, YES i did
[20:24:07] <ngharo> i mean anchors work, but ids?
[20:24:07] <eddiemonge> ngharo: yeah, try it
[20:24:13] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: Thanks, turns out ui.item.draggable('destroy'); works!
[20:24:15] <eddiemonge> id's work as anchors

[20:27:23] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, window.location doesnt work
[20:27:44] <Es0teric> i am using it with a .click function
[20:27:57] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: code?
[20:28:06] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, give me a sec

[20:32:44] <falieson> thanks everyone!
[20:32:48] <eddiemonge> because foo.com/bar could have a file called bar so rewriting isnt necessary
[20:32:53] <stringent> anyone have any experience with jsonp in ie6/7?
[20:33:17] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: no, its not window.location() its window.location =
[20:33:44] <eddiemonge> stringent: non-existent!
[20:33:49] <eddiemonge> although probably not
[20:33:49] <stringent> seriously?
[20:34:01] <eddiemonge> i just dont like troubleshooting ie6/7
[20:34:15] <stringent> i resorted to trying http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/
[20:34:29] <stringent> claims ie6 support, so i'm doing something else wrong
[20:34:33] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, yes now it works...
[20:34:35] <Es0teric> but i want to animate it
[20:34:37] <stringent> but damned if i can find it
[20:36:15] <eddiemonge> stringent: whats wrong with jquery's normal jsonp?
[20:36:30] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: then use scrollTo
[20:36:47] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, i tried using scrollTo.. i just dont know how to make it work
[20:36:51] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: yeah, the idea is for the UI on an image based CMS I'm working on
[20:36:53] <stringent> eddiemonge: probably nothing, i was just acting out of desperation
[20:37:30] <stringent> it's bizarre, the json parses fine as long as it's same domain
[20:37:45] <stringent> then when it goes cross domain, it throws an error
[20:37:52] <stringent> says it's missing a '}'
[20:38:11] <ngharo> are you sure you're responding with the correct format?
[20:38:15] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: did you read the docs for it? its pretty easy, from what i can remember
[20:38:34] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: cool, would love to see your finished product
[20:38:45] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ stringent
[20:38:46] <bot-t> stringent, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[20:38:47] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: oh, i'll be blabbing about it :P
[20:38:53] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, yeah i read the docs for it.. but i still dont understand
[20:38:58] <eddiemonge> although im not sure how much i can help you since i dont normally use jsonp

[20:41:48] <ryanneufeld> that's the "best" one out there, and the code base is next to impossible to extend, it's so terribly documented
[20:41:51] <ryanneufeld> any how
[20:41:53] <ryanneufeld> thanks again
[20:41:55] <ryanneufeld> back at it
[20:42:06] <eddiemonge> Es0teric: omg. $.scrollTo( $('#ele'), 1000);
[20:44:20] <Es0teric> eddiemonge, got it..
[20:44:21] <Es0teric> thanks
[20:45:34] <eddiemonge> stringent: what is the callback pararm?
[20:45:48] <eddiemonge> callbackParameter?
[20:46:32] <stringent> leftover from using that jsonp plugin
[20:46:33] <stringent> ignore it
[20:46:51] <stringent> i just forgot to erase it before pasting
[20:47:57] <eddiemonge> does the success parameter get fired?
[20:48:25] <stringent> no, it's throwing the error when it parses the json
[20:48:55] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: you work on the ui code base?
[20:49:30] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: scratch that, apparently you do
[20:50:03] <stringent> eddiemonge: there's something in the formation of the json itself it doesn't like, works for every other browser though
[20:50:10] <ryanneufeld> Does the sortable have a way to reject an item?
[20:50:27] <stringent> and it works if it's the same domain as the file producing the json
[20:50:29] <eddiemonge> stringent: so it gets to the success function?
[20:51:12] <stringent> eddiemonge: the browser is erroring when it sees the json, the success callback doesn't fire
[20:51:42] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: sorry was afk
[20:51:47] <kborchers> yes i do
[20:51:56] <ryanneufeld> Does the sortable have a way to reject an item?
[20:52:08] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking at the docs and nothing grabs me
[20:52:15] <kborchers> hmmm, based on what? meaning, why reject?
[20:52:52] <ryanneufeld> when the receive event happens, I'm doing an ajax
[20:52:59] <ryanneufeld> to add that item to the group
[20:53:06] <ryanneufeld> but if it already exists
[20:53:10] <ryanneufeld> I don't want it added
[20:53:26] <ryanneufeld> I'm giving the user feedback, but I'd rather it didn't append the item to the list
[20:53:38] <ryanneufeld> I could remove it after the fact I suppose
[20:53:57] <eddiemonge> stringent: can you replace callback() with alert()?
[20:54:05] <stringent> i did eddiemonge
[20:54:35] <stringent> the json is loading, but the success callback doesn't fire
[20:54:44] <stringent> the error happens once the json is loaded
[20:54:58] <stringent> when the browser parses it
[20:55:06] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: hmm, only thing off the top of my head is remove after add. not really ideal but ...
[20:55:12] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[20:55:27] <ryanneufeld> I don't mind that, it's just a matter of doing a fade out on the item
[20:55:33] <ryanneufeld> and remove it when that's done
[20:55:37] <ryanneufeld> clean UX
[20:55:45] <ryanneufeld> and the user has a chance to see what's happend
[20:55:47] <stringent> eddiemonge: the error message, fwiw, is it's missing a }
[20:56:10] <stringent> but like i said, only when it's called cross-domain
[20:57:31] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: yeah ... i don't want to discourage you but you should keep in mind that all of the interactions (sortable, draggable, droppable, etc) are being rewritten http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/36727309/FullList so things may change :\
[20:57:56] <ryanneufeld> that doesn't mean I *have* to switch to them right away :p
[20:58:34] <kborchers> not at all ... just for the future ... they may be better and do some of these things you are having to write now
[20:59:10] <eddiemonge> stringent: no idea. and there are no other errors on the page?
[20:59:19] <stringent> nope
[20:59:22] <stringent> it's bizarre
[20:59:30] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: when will that be released?
[20:59:46] <ryanneufeld> no sense in me holding back if it's not gonna be next week, know what I mean?
[21:00:29] <kborchers> no, no ... not until 2.0 and 1.9 is still months out
[21:01:26] <intellilogic> Is if(!$('#AJ_Loc')){ legit?
[21:01:37] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: yeah, I'm not worried
[21:01:42] <coldhead> it's hella unreadable
[21:01:55] <coldhead> i suspec tyou want to test for $('#someid').length
[21:02:04] <coldhead> because $('anything') always returns true
[21:02:06] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: by the time it comes out, I'll be ready to rewrite most of this anyway.
[21:02:09] <coldhead> but length will be 0
[21:02:16] <coldhead> if it doesnae exist
[21:02:56] <intellilogic> coldhead: I want to see if the element exsists at all
[21:03:00] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: yeah, probably
[21:03:11] <stringent> intellilogic: that's how you do it
[21:03:22] <coldhead> if ($('#something').length > 0)
[21:03:24] <intellilogic> stringent: Thanks :)
[21:03:42] <coldhead> yeah thanks stringent
[21:03:49] <ryanneufeld> intellilogic: if( $('#AJ_Loc').length > 0)
[21:03:57] <coldhead> good job
[21:04:05] <ryanneufeld> intellilogic: if you wanna be anal :p
[21:04:35] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: looks like the linking of sortables an draggables leaves the ui-draggable class attached after it adds it
[21:04:41] <intellilogic> I don't care the value of if it's even blank, I just want to make sure its on the page ;)  blank = acceptable to me =-0
[21:04:41] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: I can use that to remove it
[21:05:18] <ryanneufeld> intellilogic: $('#AJ_Loc').length will be zero if no element on the page exists with the id "AJ_Loc"
[21:05:32] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: cool, as long as you don't remove another one with that class ...
[21:05:47] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: I can remove the class on a legit add event :)
[21:05:56] <kborchers> duh
[21:06:01] * kborchers grabs another beer

[21:13:20] <iftrueelsefalse_> is it possible to make a non async jsonp request?
[21:13:30] <stringent> iftrueelsefalse: no
[21:13:55] <stringent> iftrueelsefalse: specifically says so in the jquery docs
[21:14:59] <ryanneufeld> iftrueelsefalse: yeah, not really a good idea any way.
[21:15:16] <iftrueelsefalse> ryanneufeld: why not?
[21:15:37] <ryanneufeld> iftrueelsefalse: you want your user to wait on data from a site you can't control?
[21:15:46] <ryanneufeld> doesn't sound like a good user experience
[21:15:48] <iftrueelsefalse> i control the site
[21:15:55] <ryanneufeld> then use sync json
[21:16:01] <iftrueelsefalse> it's just on 2 servers
[21:16:09] <stringent> iftrueelsefalse: why do you want sync?
[21:16:21] <ryanneufeld> I think that's a better question
[21:17:37] <iftrueelsefalse> storing objects in an array have a function getObject(object_id) which returns it if it is in the array else makes a jsonp request to an external server.
[21:18:44] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: hows that dragabble?
[21:18:52] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: it's fucking awesome
[21:18:58] <stringent> iftrueelsefalse: put a holder value in the array when you start the request and check for that
[21:19:05] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: http://imgur.com/XqE7t BC's finest
[21:20:30] <iftrueelsefalse> stringent: so how would the program know that the result is there, make checks every 100 ms?
[21:20:42] <stringent> the json callback
[21:20:59] <stringent> remove the value if error, let it know its there if success
[21:21:19] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: now I just have to sort out how to make it clone the data- attrs when it clones as well
[21:21:24] <stringent> *the ajax callback* i should have said
[21:21:39] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: start event maybe?
[21:21:40] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: cause I kinda need those for keeping track of sorting etc
[21:21:41] <iftrueelsefalse> there seems to be no error callback with  jsonp
[21:21:57] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: on the draggable?
[21:21:58] <stringent> iftrueelsefalse: just use $.ajax and set the dataType to 'jsonp'
[21:22:24] <iftrueelsefalse> stringent: it never calls error callback with the $.ajax
[21:22:29] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: yeah
[21:22:40] <stringent> iftrueelsefalse: then it must be loading?
[21:22:55] <gnarf> isn't the ui.item correctly set?
[21:23:06] <iftrueelsefalse> no, the console can show 500, 404 but the error callback never get's called
[21:23:09] <ryanneufeld> it is, but it doesn't have any of the data-attrs
[21:23:42] <stringent> iftrueelsefalse: then check the returned data in the success callback
[21:24:21] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: nvm, I'm an idiot
[21:24:35] <ryanneufeld> I fail at markup
[21:24:51] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: Chicago's finest IMO http://cl.ly/3d0k17142Q0S1U040H40

[21:26:29] <kborchers> wookiehangover: have not had that one
[21:26:47] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: Naperville, IL ... outside of Chicago
[21:26:55] <iftrueelsefalse> stringent: the success doesn't get called on error
[21:27:21] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: cool, there a way to get the "last thing added" to a sortable?
[21:28:37] <kborchers> you mean outside of one of the sortable events ... like later unrelated to an event?
[21:29:31] <ryanneufeld> well, in receive the ui.item, is the original
[21:29:37] <ryanneufeld> not the clone
[21:29:45] <ryanneufeld> I need the one that gets added
[21:29:51] <ryanneufeld> I suppose stop would have that...
[21:29:54] * ryanneufeld checks
[21:31:21] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/3FmQK/ so this function works but its 40 lines long and I think it can probably be reduced to 10. Can someone show me?
[21:31:53] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: so, ui.item in stop is the new one, and in receive it's the original
[21:31:59] <falieson> basically what it does is toggles my right column depending on the window size, and resizes the left wrapper accordingly
[21:32:24] <ryanneufeld> is sortstop the very last thing to happen?
[21:34:12] <kborchers> ryanneufeld: hmmm, i think maybe update
[21:34:33] <ryanneufeld> update is the last event fired?
[21:35:09] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: would be nice to have the order of those documented...
[21:35:19] <ryanneufeld> docs aren't clear on that one
[21:35:45] <kborchers> update: "This event is triggered when the user stopped sorting and the DOM position has changed."
[21:36:22] <kborchers> yeah ... order might be helpful
[21:38:17] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's kinda vague, so I've stopped sorting
[21:38:28] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[21:38:35] <ryanneufeld> well, I'm sure I'll figure this out too
[21:47:42] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: update happens before stop
[21:48:03] <kborchers> makes sense
[21:48:18] <ryanneufeld> so stop is the last thing to happen
[21:51:15] <lng> .after() inserts cotent and as many times it's called, content is apended. is there replace alternative? otherwise, I need to use .remove() before .after()
[22:04:25] <LordZardeck> is there anyway to filter an ajax response like you can a ajax request?
[22:13:51] <gnarf> LordZardeck: .pipe()
[22:13:58] <gnarf> LordZardeck: can you be more specific?
[22:15:32] <gnarf> you can also use "filters"
[22:15:34] <gnarf> ?ajax filters
[22:15:35] <bot-t> gnarf, Extending Ajax: Prefilters, Converters, and Transports - As of jQuery 1.5, $.ajax() provides three means to extend its functionalities for sending, receiving, and managing ajax requests: http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[22:15:45] <gnarf> converters rather
[22:15:48] <gnarf> define a datatype
[22:17:38] <LordZardeck> well, i want to be able to capture certain ajax calls, and parse the response before the callback is executed. but in that parsing, I want to be able to do things based on the response code, including NOT executing the callback
[22:18:06] <LordZardeck> i thought about converters, but they don't expose the status code
[22:18:10] <LordZardeck> do they?
[22:19:01] <gnarf> LordZardeck: sounds like a prefilter to me
[22:19:20] <gnarf> you basically get access to all aspects of the ajax request in a prefilter
[22:19:27] <gnarf> but really, its prolly a combo of all of the above
[22:19:33] <LordZardeck> but i need the response
[22:19:46] <gnarf> prefilters can attach methods on the ajax deferred too
[22:19:48] <gnarf> like pipe

[22:20:15] <gnarf> lemme google that

[22:21:10] <gnarf> .pipe isn't covered cuz it didn't exist yet
[22:21:25] <ch3mi0n> What's up
[22:23:41] <LordZardeck> i'm not sure how this all works, but is this what you are talking about? http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2255-Using-jQuery-s-Pipe-Method-To-Change-Deferred-Resolution.htm
[22:24:55] <jtannenbaum> I have "// @require        http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js" in the header of my .user.js but it's still saying $ is undefined
[22:25:43] <ch3mi0n> It has to be there when the script is installed
[22:26:01] <jtannenbaum> what do you mean "there"?
[22:26:20] <ch3mi0n> If you add that line after the script has already been installed it won't use jquery
[22:26:45] <jtannenbaum> I reinstalled the userscript after I added the line, though
[22:27:00] <ch3mi0n> Try jQuery
[22:27:04] <ch3mi0n> Instead of $
[22:27:32] <jtannenbaum> jQuery is not defined
[22:27:53] <ch3mi0n> Then you're doing something wrong
[22:29:18] <jtannenbaum> http://paste.pound-python.org/show/13957/
[22:36:32] <jtannenbaum> $ ends up being defined when the page is done loadings

[22:37:59] <samrat> can I create simple modal dialogs without using any plugins?
[22:40:06] <ch3mi0n> samrat: sure, why not?
[22:40:28] <ch3mi0n> samrat: you'd be reinventing the wheel, though
[22:40:50] <samrat> ch3mi0n- can these plugins be used with bookmarklets?
[22:41:13] <ch3mi0n> Of course, just include the minified version in the source
[22:41:23] <niloy> wassup people
[22:41:39] <ch3mi0n> You should just search for the most lightweight of the modal plugins you can find
[22:41:48] <ch3mi0n> And go with that
[22:41:52] <ch3mi0n> Or whatever works
[22:50:17] <temporarytao> hi. anybody know why binding a function to .submit that has a preventDefault() call futzes everything?
[23:07:17] <lng> what is the name of the event when user pastes something to form?
[23:08:08] <lng> I use keypress and it works just fine, but I need to trigger pastes also
[23:08:48] <ch3mi0n> Try keyup
[23:09:11] <ch3mi0n> Unless you mean right-click and selecting "paste"
[23:09:53] <lng> all of them would be good to have
[23:10:00] <ch3mi0n> I would go with a combination event like "keyup change" (will trigger on either event)
[23:10:35] <ch3mi0n> It's tricky, though, because how do you know it's a paste and not just someone entering text
[23:11:30] <lng> keyup works for both, typing and pasting
[23:11:44] <ch3mi0n> You might try checking the length of the value. Set some sort of threshhold. If the value length goes up by X amount, assume it's a paste.
[23:12:01] <ch3mi0n> I know that, I'm saying how do you account for typing versus pasting
[23:12:20] <ch3mi0n> I'm assuming whatever you're doing you want ONLY to happen for pasting, not just typing
[23:13:19] <ch3mi0n> Also change might not work so well, now that I think about it, because I think the input has to be blurred before it will register a change
[23:13:31] <ch3mi0n> Hmm. You'll have to test it
[23:13:48] <lng> yes
[23:14:40] <ch3mi0n> Oh, hey
[23:14:50] <ch3mi0n> I think there's actually an onpaste event
[23:15:10] <ch3mi0n> I'm not sure if it's supported in jQuery
[23:15:11] <lng> really?
[23:15:35] <ch3mi0n> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5450449/detect-paste-in-input-box
[23:16:42] <ch3mi0n> Doesn't have great adoption across all browsers, looks like
[23:16:56] <lng> this doesn't work - $('#main_purchased_item_udid').onpaste(function() {..
[23:17:53] <lng> I think it's better maybe to add button
[23:17:57] <lng> instead
[23:18:13] <ch3mi0n> You can't do .onpaste on a jQuery chain
[23:18:20] <ch3mi0n> It's not a jQuery function
[23:18:35] <lng> oh
[23:18:55] <ch3mi0n> You have to use vanilla JS
[23:19:13] <lng> wjat is it?
[23:19:20] <ch3mi0n> JS
[23:19:34] <ch3mi0n> Plain old
[23:19:50] <ch3mi0n> Unenhanced
[23:19:54] <ch3mi0n> Raw
[23:20:00] <ch3mi0n> Normal
[23:20:16] <lng> how do I use it?
[23:20:49] <ch3mi0n> Just write code that doesn't rely on jQuery or other framework  ^^
[23:20:59] <lng> ah, ok
[23:21:13] <ch3mi0n> For binding that event anyway
[23:21:23] <ch3mi0n> You can continue to use jQuery for your other stuff
[23:21:31] <lng> I think there should be specialplugin
[23:21:57] <lng> to detect user stopped typing
[23:22:37] <ch3mi0n> Read the accepted answer herre http://stackoverflow.com/questions/237254/how-do-you-handle-oncut-oncopy-and-onpaste-in-jquery
[23:25:14] <lng> ch3mi0n: not sure how to use it
[23:25:28] <ch3mi0n> It says right there...
[23:25:36] <ch3mi0n> -_-
[23:25:51] <lng> ch3mi0n: just bind it?
[23:25:56] <SandmanNet> Hmmmm
[23:26:05] <ch3mi0n> It is an event
[23:26:51] <ch3mi0n> jQuery bind adds an event listener, or you can just do element.addEventListener
[23:27:01] <ch3mi0n> Look at the examples there
[23:27:18] <ch3mi0n> It's pretty straightforward
[23:27:59] <ch3mi0n> Gotta go, have fun
[23:28:09] <lng> thanks
