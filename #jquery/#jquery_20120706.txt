[00:00:00] <Cork> abjorn: it might, prop and attr won't return the same string
[00:00:09] <abjorn> *shrug*
[00:00:17] <BinaryKitten> Cork ? ok doesn't prop set as well?
[00:00:18] <Cork> prop is what the browser corrects the url to
[00:00:26] <Cork> BinaryKitten: it deos
[00:00:28] <Cork> *does
[00:00:37] <BinaryKitten> bah that's messy
[00:00:42] <hemangpatel> but where do i put image between ajax call ?
[00:00:50] <Cork> attr is what the attribute in the tag says, nomatter if the browser needs to correct it
[00:00:50] <abjorn> wherever you want to put it
[00:01:08] <hemangpatel> how do i put in so $('#form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.post($('#form').prop('action'), $('#form').serialize()); });
[00:01:08] <BinaryKitten> hemangpatel you mean like a loading image?
[00:01:18] <hemangpatel> BinaryKitten : yes
[00:01:30] <BinaryKitten> hemangpatel use .ajaxStart and .ajaxEnd outside of that
[00:01:31] <Cork> hemangpatel: you can put it direct after the $.post or right before
[00:01:33] <Cork> doesn't matter
[00:01:40] <coldhead> i am never ever going to use prop()
[00:01:50] <BinaryKitten> props to you coldhead
[00:02:01] <abjorn> coldhead: you have to for some things though :(
[00:02:26] <abjorn> This seems to happen a lot, though. Someone asks how to do something, and the people who know how argue over the best method.
[00:02:27] <coldhead> hahahaha BinaryKitten <3
[00:02:27] <abjorn> EXPERTS
[00:02:36] <abjorn> also yay pun
[00:03:48] <abjorn> except coldhead, he's not an expert
[00:04:01] <coldhead> abjorn: as long as the poor user gets SOMETHING that works, the disputation is healthy
[00:04:09] <abjorn> tru nuff
[00:04:19] <coldhead> i love when Cork schools people
[00:04:22] <BinaryKitten> no abjorn i heard he's only been using jQuery for a day
[00:04:24] <coldhead> it makes me all puffy down there
[00:04:30] <abjorn> it's true BK
[00:04:37] <Cork> "puffy"?!?
[00:04:46] <abjorn> if it's puffy...i think you should see a doctor
[00:04:49] * Cork steps back a few steps
[00:04:55] <coldhead> someday i'll be an expert
[00:04:58] <coldhead> but not on my first day
[00:05:05] <abjorn> i was an expert on my first day
[00:05:10] <abjorn> but you're no abjorn
[00:05:18] <Cork> i don't see my self as an expert either
[00:05:29] <coldhead> there are no experts
[00:05:30] <hemangpatel> thanks to all
[00:05:36] <abjorn> I don't see anyone that doesn't fiddle or work on the source as an expert
[00:05:42] <coldhead> no  kings, no governors, no wife, no horse, no moustache
[00:05:54] <BinaryKitten> Expert from too parts Ex and Spert .. Ex as in hasbeen and spert as in spirt as in a drip
[00:06:00] <BinaryKitten> Experts = Hasbeen Drips
[00:06:07] <coldhead> hahaha
[00:06:08] <abjorn> well
[00:06:10] <abjorn> that makes sense
[00:06:17] <abjorn> lots of it, in fact
[00:06:21] <coldhead> and props for not going down the obvious route of spurts
[00:06:30] <fRAiLtY-> lol
[00:06:32] * BinaryKitten never wants to be an expert
[00:06:40] <BinaryKitten> coldhead obvious route?
[00:06:48] * BinaryKitten thought she did go the obvious route
[00:06:55] <abjorn> obvious if you're a heathen like coldhead
[00:07:00] <coldhead> maybe my brain is on backwards
[00:07:08] <gnarf> coldhead: maybe?
[00:07:09] <coldhead> i'm sorry, i have a cold
[00:07:13] <gnarf> ?csb
[00:07:15] * Cork puts coldhead in reverse
[00:07:15] <abjorn> o sup gnarf
[00:07:23] <coldhead> how rude, gnarf
[00:07:29] * BinaryKitten waits for coldhead to switch nick to headcold
[00:07:38] <Cork> XD
[00:07:39] <coldhead> i wish i knew how, BinaryKitten
[00:07:42] <coldhead> #firstday
[00:07:47] <gnarf> lol
[00:07:53] <coldhead> it's /quit headcold, right?
[00:07:57] <abjorn> yes
[00:08:17] <abjorn> IT HAPPENED
[00:08:25] <Cork> :)
[00:08:33] <BinaryKitten> that guy
[00:08:40] <BinaryKitten> cracks me up
[00:08:40] <Cork> lol
[00:08:42] <bot-t> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[00:08:43] <abjorn> okay, now someone /mode +b coldhead headcold
[00:08:47] <Cork> ya he's special
[00:08:56] <coldhead> i think that worked
[00:09:00] <coldhead> nope
[00:09:03] <BinaryKitten> the channel mascot?
[00:09:03] <coldhead> i'll try again
[00:09:19] <abjorn> channels have mascots?
[00:09:30] <BinaryKitten> why not abjorn
[00:09:43] <abjorn> coldhead: it's /nick coldhead_is_a_noob
[00:09:45] <BinaryKitten> if projects can, if operating systems can, if sports teams can
[00:18:36] <abjorn> suddenly it got all join/part in here
[00:30:29] <Industrial> I'm looking for a way to slide content in and out of the page in a block horizontally
[00:30:36] <Industrial> I do not want any scrollbar.
[00:32:05] <coldhead> Industrial: have you considered any of the many jQuery "carousel" plugins?
[00:32:22] <coldhead> or if you prefer to roll your own look no further than .animate() and overflow:hidden;
[00:32:24] <coldhead> ?animate
[00:32:25] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[00:34:18] <coldhead> without air still breathing so silent with reason with reason without air still breathing unread but understood
[00:35:58] <coldhead> this full house without air
[00:36:10] <coldhead> pages float into pieces
[00:42:24] <Industrial> coldhead: I'm not sure a carousel is what I want. It's the whole page content in several 'levels' that I want to slide between.
[00:42:34] <Industrial> e.g. language > theme > module
[00:43:02] <Industrial> it's not a list of pages/things but a tree :)
[00:43:13] <coldhead> sounds complicated
[00:43:28] <coldhead> i think your best bet is to find out how someone did something similar and "borrow"
[00:43:35] <coldhead> OR roll up your sleeves
[00:44:17] <Industrial> coldhead: I've been messing with animate a bit, where does overflow: hidden; come in?
[00:44:52] <coldhead> Industrial: that stops you getting scrollbars
[00:45:00] <Industrial> nice
[00:48:58] <coldhead> I HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS DREAM OF YOU SERENE SURROUNDED IN A SUNFLOWER SEED
[00:57:22] <endrem> someone that can tell me why i cant get <div ...ext:tree-node-id="256"> with the expression jQuery(this).closest("ext\\:tree-node-id").val(); ?
[00:59:04] <coldhead> jQuery(this).closest("[ext\\:tree-node-id]")
[01:07:24] <endrem> given<div ext:tree-node-id="256"> why does jQuery(this).closest("ext\\:tree-node-id").val(); return undefined?
[01:08:46] <NodeX> you'll need to extend the selector to do it that way
[01:09:18] <juha_> endrem: re-read coldhead's selector
[01:09:22] <NodeX> i strongly suggest you use data- where you can as it wont break the DOM
[01:09:43] <endrem> why you need to extend the selector?
[01:10:10] <coldhead> to teach it to magically match things that jQuery doesn't ordinarily search for
[01:10:14] <endrem> and what do you men by using data?
[01:10:44] <endrem> though jquery could find any attribute on an element like div
[01:11:19] <endrem> it says on theyr faq to just escape : with \\: here http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_select_an_element_that_has_weird_characters_in_its_ID.3F
[01:11:50] <coldhead> that's talking about selecting an element
[01:11:58] <juha_> endrem: did you try the selector coldhead provided you?
[01:11:59] <coldhead> you're talking about selecting by an attribute
[01:12:18] <coldhead> $('type=checkbox') will not select checkboxes for you
[01:12:39] <endrem> I will try it. Thanks! But just surprised that jquery can not select any attribute.
[01:12:46] <coldhead> it CAN
[01:12:51] <coldhead> you just have to use the right syntax
[01:12:59] <coldhead> it needs [square brackets]
[01:13:26] <coldhead> jQuery uses CSS3 selectors. read up on them for the great enlightenment
[01:13:36] <juha_> endrem: have a look at http://api.jquery.com/category/attributes/
[01:13:38] <endrem> Ah - ok... ill try it.
[01:13:42] <juha_> no wait wrong url
[01:14:17] <juha_> endrem: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/ and especially http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/
[01:16:51] <venu> Hi everyone.I am using jqueryround about plugin for a website.Each movable item has some text in the form of <p> tags.When item is in focus text displays properly but when the same item moves behind , text  appears although it is out of the movable items .Please help..
[01:17:27] <endrem> Ok - I must have missed something - jQuery(this).closest("[ext\\:tree-node-id]").val() - should work. Should it not?
[01:17:49] <Cork> no
[01:18:22] <Cork> you need to dubble escape \\
[01:18:45] <Cork> and that is if your trying to select <ext:tree-done-id> that is
[01:19:03] <tintin> Hello
[01:19:11] <NodeX> [09:07:22] <endrem> given<div ext:tree-node-id="256">
[01:19:15] <xec> Cork: it's an attribute, should work i'd think, depending on what $(this) refers to
[01:19:17] <Cork> ah
[01:19:41] <xec> i mean, doing .val() on a <div> doesn't make much sense?
[01:19:52] <juha_> .text() or .html()
[01:19:57] <juha_> would be better
[01:20:12] <Cork> not sure why your scoping the attribute
[01:20:15] <Cork> just use data-
[01:20:38] <xec> juha_: depends on what he wants, this is obviously an ancestor
[01:21:19] <xec> endrem: why are you doing .closest()? and what is "this"? and why are you doing .val()? and what are you really trying to do? :)
[01:21:32] <Cork> :D
[01:21:51] <Cork> i suspect that this is the div; and if so then it all collapse
[01:22:02] <xec> yeah, i have a similar feeling :)
[01:22:11] <coldhead> experts
[01:22:13] * coldhead spits
[01:22:14] <tintin> xec: Hi sec
[01:22:24] <ruby_on_tails> huha~
[01:22:28] <tintin> coldhead: Don't do this in channel, that's rubbish
[01:22:35] <tintin> ruby_on_tails: lol
[01:22:36] <ruby_on_tails> tintin
[01:22:40] <tintin> ruby_on_rails
[01:22:42] <ruby_on_tails> where is snowy
[01:22:54] <tintin> snowy is playing
[01:22:58] <aro> is there a way to bookmark jquery ui tabs?
[01:23:04] <tintin> ruby_on_tails: Where is ruby_on_rails ?
[01:23:06] <endrem> xec: it is an ancestor I want. Two parents up.
[01:23:12] <ruby_on_tails> tintin: no where :(
[01:23:18] <Cork> aro: yes, just bookmar the #value link
[01:23:18] <xec> endrem: what is, i asked 4 questions there ;)
[01:23:24] <Cork> *bookmark
[01:23:27] <aro> cork: how?
[01:23:29] <ruby_on_tails> aro: maybe use #links which can be bookmarked
[01:23:34] <endrem> juha: text() gave me the html of the element I clicked not the value of the attribute and html() gave me some javascript
[01:23:52] <Cork> endrem: use .attr
[01:23:55] <endrem> xec: backtracking...
[01:24:03] <ruby_on_tails> endrem: 2 parents up = .parent().parent()
[01:24:04] <aro> i need to update the location bar when a user clicks a tab
[01:24:12] <xec> endrem: if you want to read an attribute do .attr()
[01:24:14] <ruby_on_tails> aro: make it a link
[01:24:35] <Cork> aro: the ui-tabs use the hash by default
[01:24:40] <Cork> aro: it should just work
[01:25:16] <aro> definitely isnt using the hash
[01:25:49] <Cork> aro: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/default.html#tabs-3
[01:25:57] <Cork> as an example
[01:26:03] <aro> console.log( window.location.hash );
[01:26:03] <aro> undefined
[01:26:11] <xec> endrem: i'm guessing (empasis on guessing) that what you might want is $(this).closest("[ext\\:tree-node-id]").attr(["ext:tree-node-id")
[01:26:26] <aro> cork: that page doesnt work either
[01:26:32] <endrem> ive done parent().parent().html - Which shows me the div i want. but doing .attr("ext:node-tree-id") doesnt give me anything
[01:26:45] <Cork> aro: so it loads in the first tab for you?
[01:26:59] <aro> no it loads the third, but when i click tabs it doesnt update the location bar
[01:27:06] <aro> therefore, cannot bookmark the page
[01:27:07] <xec> endrem: you're selecting an element, based on attribute, while .val() will get the value attribute's value of a form element
[01:27:14] <Cork> aro: cause the default action is prevented
[01:27:30] <Cork> aro: just let the default action happen and it should work
[01:27:38] <xec> endrem: am i making any sense? http://jsfiddle.net/fWPsY/
[01:27:43] <aro> where is the default action prevented?
[01:28:14] <venu> Cork:Hi.I am using jqueryround about plugin for a website.Each movable item has some text in the form of <p> tags.When item is in focus text displays properly but when the same item moves behind , text  appears although it is out of the movable items .Please help..
[01:29:46] <coldhead> Cork:hi
[01:29:47] <endrem> xec: cheers! alert(jQuery(this).closest("[ext\\:tree-node-id]").attr("ext:tree-node-id")); works. I owe you a beer:)
[01:30:08] <coldhead> yes, good old xec, taking all the glory AS USUAL
[01:30:16] * xec hugs coldhead
[01:30:44] <aro> nvm i figured it out
[01:30:44] <Cork> aro: its inside the plugin, simplest is prob to just set the has your self
[01:30:47] * coldhead weeps in joy at the human contact
[01:30:49] <xec> endrem: next time try to specify what you want, alongside your code snippet ;)
[01:31:32] <jarco> I am trying to unset height and padding in animate but it seems like its not working like it should
[01:31:38] <aro> damn no i dont
[01:31:39] <endrem> not yet got me head round jQuery.
[01:31:56] <aro> i got it updating the location bar, but the page jumps down to the content when i click it
[01:33:00] <Cork> aro: ya, if you change the url that happens
[01:33:02] <johnathanb> I'm posting a form via ajax, it should either return HTML or JSON, html if there was a validation error and JSON with a redirect URL if everything was ok. This works great in every browser except Firefox.
[01:33:22] <johnathanb> Firefox doesn't know that JSON is being returned to just displays the response out on the page.
[01:33:40] <xec> endrem: yes but that doesn't stop you from phrasing questions better, like say: i'd like to retrieve an attribute value of an ancestor element - what i tried was (code snippet)
[01:34:02] <Trisox> :D
[01:34:07] <xec> endrem: now we were all just guessing what you were trying to do ;)
[01:34:29] <jarco> Any any idea where i go wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/PNUEJ/3/
[01:34:31] <Cork> johnathanb: pb your code
[01:34:48] <Trisox> look at xec raising people to ask proper questions on the jquery freenode server !  :D
[01:35:07] <Cork> johnathanb: you can't animate to browser default values
[01:35:15] <xec> Trisox: i have a sneaking suspicion it might be a lost cause ^^
[01:35:20] <Cork> you need to specify what it should aninate to
[01:35:22] <endrem> haha - yeah that would describe it better.
[01:35:30] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[01:35:33] <Trisox> I might be sure it is ;)
[01:35:41] <Cork> jarco: that last two was for you :)
[01:35:47] <johnathanb> Cork https://gist.github.com/3058964
[01:36:12] <jarco> Cork: isnt width556px ok?
[01:36:33] <Cork> jarco: the padding: '', height: '' isn't
[01:36:53] <Cork> johnathanb: and your setting the correct encoding server side?
[01:36:54] <jarco> How can I then hide the element untill the very moment it starts animating?
[01:37:06] <johnathanb> Cork: Yep
[01:37:14] <Cork> johnathanb: what error do you get
[01:37:29] <jarco> I am trying to unset these 2 settings so it doesnt show a very small version of the box before the animation
[01:37:44] <johnathanb> I don't get an error, but when the JSON comes back (In Firefox) it doesn't treat it an an object, it treats it as text so outputs that on the page.
[01:37:55] <Trisox> this works for me in firefox
[01:37:55] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/PNUEJ/5/
[01:37:58] <Trisox> johnathanb
[01:38:04] <Cork> jarco: you would need to fetch what height it should have
[01:38:20] <jarco> ah of course. Silly me :) I can animate to that
[01:38:23] <Trisox> btw use proper css tags that map on the jquery
[01:38:38] <ruby_on_tails> http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/glazing-ribbon-screensaver-effect-in-html5-canvas my ribbons tutorial is up :>
[01:38:57] <jarco> Cork: If i get the padding and height I can animate to it in the same statement?
[01:39:08] <Cork> jarco: see Trisox's response
[01:39:49] <Trisox> oh lol i responed to johnathanb sorry was for jarco :D
[01:39:55] <Cork> Trisox: application/json ?
[01:40:10] <jarco> idd I am confused now :)
[01:40:25] <Trisox> jarco: http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/PNUEJ/5/
[01:40:30] <Cork> lol
[01:40:37] <Trisox> Cork:  i didnt ask a question ;)
[01:40:44] <Cork> true
[01:40:53] <Cork> johnathanb: application/json ?
[01:41:03] <jarco> Trisox: yes i just got that
[01:41:28] <johnathanb> Cork: Yea, it's difinitely being set correctly
[01:42:10] <Cork> johnathanb: that is weird, sounds like a jquery bug then
[01:42:18] <jarco> thanks for the help guys. Its a pity you cant actually unset css while animating but its a good workaround to get the values u want before and go to them that way :)
[01:42:46] <gnarf> jarco: its just a flaw in like the model of css
[01:42:52] <gnarf> you can't get that value without first setting it
[01:43:06] <gnarf> jarco: i fiddled up something for someone asking the same thing yesterday
[01:43:09] <Trisox> jarco: you can set it to 0px in animation?
[01:43:27] <tintin> gnarf: Hi,
[01:43:33] <tintin> gnarf: How are you?
[01:43:34] <gnarf> but like you can store current, set it to '' - store end, set it back to current, animate to end
[01:43:44] <jarco> yes but 0px would not unset the variable
[01:44:11] <johnathanb> Cork: So is there a workaround or something I can do?
[01:44:19] * Cork hugs bot-t
[01:44:20] * bot-t hugs Cork back
[01:44:20] <jarco> i know you can unset with .css('value',''); so i assumed it worked that way in animate also
[01:44:31] <Trisox> jarco: true ;) look @ what gnarf said
[01:44:31] <tintin> gnarf: How do you debug jquery source code and how do you maintain jquery
[01:44:43] <tintin> jquery source is a huge amount of code
[01:45:01] <Cork> johnathanb: i would go through the full call with an unminimized jquery lib and see where it fails
[01:45:03] <jarco> yeah I read that. We are lucky jquery has so many solutions :)
[01:45:11] <Trisox> tintin: he is doing that by beeing awsome !!
[01:45:22] <Cork> johnathanb: i've used that part in jquery 1.4 and that it worked fine (in all browsers)
[01:45:32] <tintin> Trisox: That's not a specific helpful answer to follow
[01:45:34] <Cork> haven't used it in later versions
[01:45:38] <gnarf> jarco: i would bake it into animate if it didn't feel like a complete hack :)
[01:45:40] <Trisox> haha i know haha ;)
[01:46:07] <gnarf> tintin: debugging, the same way anyone else debugs, with a debugger - see ?ftj
[01:46:07] <bot-t> tintin, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[01:46:27] <jarco> hehe
[01:46:30] <gnarf> tintin: maintaining - by reading the code and making fixes?
[01:47:22] <Cork> and if you just fiddle with the core jquery its not THAT much code
[01:47:40] <tintin> gnarf: Which tool you use to debug? firebug ?
[01:47:58] <gnarf> tintin: whichever tool is in the browser I'm using... I generally develop first in Chrome
[01:48:19] <tintin> gnarf: How much time can it take for me to contribute in jquery code?
[01:48:32] <ruby_on_tails> thats just 1 push away to the git repo
[01:48:42] <tintin> gnarf: How many month did it take for you to contribute in jquery source code?
[01:48:57] <Trisox> who interview much!
[01:49:04] <gnarf> I was using jQuery for maybe a year? *shrug*
[01:49:20] <gnarf> I just started diving in, and had a few pulls that never landed...
[01:49:22] <ruby_on_tails> i have been using it for a couple of years, yet contributed nothing
[01:49:31] <tintin> ruby_on_tails: But you don't have access to main mirror to push, you have to do pull request, i think
[01:49:41] <ruby_on_tails> maybe, i have no clue
[01:49:53] <gnarf> there is no "mirror" in git
[01:49:57] <gnarf> but sure
[01:49:58] <Trisox> i'm also waiting for the clue :|
[01:50:16] <gnarf> git is a distributed VCS - each is its own Repository ---
[01:50:27] <tintin> gnarf: So where is the jquery code maintained ?
[01:50:34] <gnarf> github.com/jquery/jquery
[01:51:07] <tintin> It's here, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/ , yes
[01:51:35] <ruby_on_tails> so you are going to contribute now ?
[01:51:39] <tintin> And where is the bug list?
[01:51:49] <gnarf> bugs.jquery.com
[01:52:48] <tintin> gnarf: Do you have a personal website/blog to follow?
[01:53:07] <ruby_on_tails> HE IS FROM FBI !!!
[01:53:14] <gnarf> I'm not a very prolific writer on the topic
[01:53:32] <gnarf> but i'm pretty sure you could find that with a little reasearch
[01:53:34] <tintin> systemfault: Hi, is your system is faulty again?
[01:55:34] <tintin> gotcha, http://gnarf.net/about/
[01:56:33] <aro> why does ben alman call himself cowboy
[01:56:36] <aro> is he a third grader?
[01:56:58] <codeAssassin> guys, does anyone know if there is a php library for checking sizzle.js style selectors?
[01:57:08] <johnathanb> Cork
[01:57:38] <codeAssassin> maybe the almighty gnarf?
[01:57:43] <gnarf> codeAssassin: I've seen a few, but don't recommend any of the ones I've seen
[01:57:55] <johnathanb> Cork: Checked data.indexOf( 'redirect' ) and if that's a thing and not an object I put it through $.parseJSON, looks and sounds fucking horrible but it works. Which is cool.
[01:58:09] <codeAssassin> gnarf: lol, so i'm gonna have to write my own huh
[01:58:09] <gnarf> codeAssassin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/260605/php-css-selector-library
[01:58:39] <codeAssassin> gnarf: not really what i meant
[01:58:46] <codeAssassin> gnarf: i just need the validators
[01:58:55] <tintin> gnarf: Is it with wordpress? http://gnarf.net/
[01:58:59] <gnarf> codeAssassin: you want to parse the selectors themselves?
[01:59:18] <gnarf> tintin: yes, and jesus, why the stalker act?
[01:59:24] <codeAssassin> gnarf: yeah, i want to validate the selector, because those will be generated in a config object
[01:59:26] <NodeX> troll lol
[01:59:36] <tintin> NodeX: You are troll
[01:59:45] <NodeX> correct
[02:00:02] <gnarf> codeAssassin: hrm
[02:00:29] <gnarf> codeAssassin: it doesn't seem too hard to parse the css selectors
[02:00:46] <gnarf> seems kinda active: https://github.com/sabberworm/PHP-CSS-Parser/
[02:01:35] <gnarf> of course you could prolly just steal the selector parse code
[02:01:47] <gnarf> that does way more than just selectors
[02:01:58] <codeAssassin> gnarf: i'll mention the author though. i'm an open source guy as well
[02:02:10] <codeAssassin> gnarf: thnx, i'll go have a look
[02:02:15] <ravenzz> why would you parse css in php?
[02:02:30] <codeAssassin> gnarf: this is actually for an open source drupal module i'm creating.
[02:02:51] <NodeX> I can think of quite a few reasons you would parse CSS in php
[02:03:10] <NodeX> the main one being the ability to unique every class
[02:03:33] <ravenzz> buh
[02:04:14] <codeAssassin> ra
[02:04:42] <NodeX> buh ?
[02:04:56] <codeAssassin> ravenzz: it's for validating sizzle.js selectors. not something like lesscss
[02:05:53] <ravenzz> what does it means? validate sizzle.js selectors?
[02:06:59] <codeAssassin> either use your head, or google
[02:15:49] <jammsen> Hi guys
[02:16:06] <jammsen> is it in cake.13 possible to set meta data from a view?
[02:20:17] <mindis|wurk> hmm, how do you set a gradient background for several browsers? if i try .css({'background-image' : mozillastuff, 'background-image' : webkitstuff}) the last one overwrites the other(s)
[02:20:56] <jammsen> mindis|wurk : http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[02:21:15] <mindis|wurk> i know that site but it doesn't answer the question
[02:21:36] <mindis|wurk> i suppose i could manually write the whole style attribute but surely there's some other way
[02:22:36] <Cork> mindis|wurk: use class
[02:22:44] <mindis|wurk> can't
[02:23:09] <Cork> then you have to test what prefix you should use (if any) and only use that
[02:23:20] <mindis|wurk> hmmh :/
[02:24:12] <Cork> the error correction from css file parsing doens't exist if you do it from js
[02:28:30] <mindis|wurk> i opted to manually write the style attribute and then just using .css for other stuff normally. seems to work okay
[03:00:13] <asher^> hi all, im trying to select the row in a table that an element is in, im using $(this).closest('tr') but it doesnt seem to be working. anyone have an idea of what im doing wrong?
[03:01:37] <Cork> asher^: not without seeing the code
[03:01:59] <Cork> that should work uf your doing it from an event listner on the target element

[03:40:15] <tocka> Wanted to ask is it possible to do: lets say if the user is not on <div #homepage> then an alert prompts out?
[03:40:27] <tocka> im using waypoint plugin but I cant figure this one out :(

[03:45:14] <code_ph0y> 0:) lol
[03:45:59] <sacho> have you considered using a pastebin where we can actually read your code
[03:46:09] <Krambiorix> hi guys , i try to call a PHP script via ajax but the post vars aren't being received.... http://pastebin.com/sQpLnVAC    -> in firebug the post vars are : user=test&pass=test&search=T&task=autocomplete
[03:46:46] <sacho> also, consider less nesting.
[03:46:51] <sacho> I doubt someone is going to sit down and look at that shit.
[03:47:13] <Krambiorix> can anyone help me on this one, i'm stuck
[03:47:43] <sacho> Krambiorix, not surprising
[03:47:56] <sacho> you're telling the server you're sending json, whereas you're sending urlencoded form data.
[03:48:46] <Krambiorix> sacho, i removed  dataType: "json" but still no post vars
[03:48:53] <sacho> not datatype.
[03:48:55] <sacho> contenttype.
[03:49:12] <sacho> dataType is what you expect to receive.
[03:49:13] <Sythius> application/json
[03:49:18] <Krambiorix> sacho, what should it be then?
[03:49:26] <Krambiorix> application/....
[03:49:40] <sacho> you don't need to set it. by default it's urlencoded
[03:49:49] <Sythius> urlencoded
[03:50:00] <sacho> you could have checked the api docs and found the answer to this question
[03:50:11] <Krambiorix> aha! great!!!
[03:50:12] <Krambiorix> it works
[03:50:19] <Sythius> lol
[03:50:19] <Krambiorix> thanks a lot Sythius , sacho !!!
[03:50:37] <Sythius> sacho beat me to it lol
[03:52:01] <code_ph0y> sacho: is that better? http://pastebin.com/ZeEPHs3t
[03:52:22] <sacho> ? it's still nested as hell
[03:52:52] <nickSwe> Hi, I am having a annoying and strange problem that I cannot figure out myself. I have a for-loop that creates markers on a google map object. But for some reason my internal integer does not get passed correctly and is indicated as a NaN (Not a Number) instead of a integer. Can someone please have a look at the code (30 some lines of code) and tell me where I am going wrong? http://pastebin.
[03:52:52] <nickSwe> com/1WHV3dZw
[03:54:01] <code_ph0y> sacho soz this not the final code its just trying to show you what am trying to do
[03:54:15] <sacho> I don't see what you're trying to do
[03:54:42] <sacho> nickSwe, why are you using a global i/
[03:54:54] <DreamStiller> ok guys
[03:55:05] <DreamStiller> jsfiddle seems to fail now
[03:55:10] <DreamStiller> anything else i can use?
[03:55:41] <code_ph0y> basically I have remove links and I wanna hook them up to ajax but when the remove ajax call is placed in the success I have to create a new call ... but if am doing that method the process will never stop
[03:55:58] <sacho> what does gmap3 do? maybe it's setting i as well.
[03:56:03] <gsr> Hi all. , I'm setting up a form using the $('#something').find('form').form('submit', {}); clause.  I have the onSubmit:function and success:functions setup - however, success get's run even when onSubmit returns false.  am I missing something?
[03:56:36] <nickSwe> sacho: i am not using a global i? its initiated by the for-loop? yeah you're right - perhaps I can try a different name for it rather than i :)
[03:56:38] <sacho> wtf is .form()?
[03:56:59] <sacho> nickSwe, you're using a global i.
[03:57:05] <sacho> nickSwe, you haven't declared it anywhere.
[03:57:12] <gsr> sacho: hmm, this may be framework specifc then (EasyUI), not jquery...
[03:58:16] <ij> I can add as many submit event handlers as I want, right?
[03:58:35] <sacho> nickSwe, at any rate - the most probable explanation is that *something* is setting i to NaN between your initialization and the click event(assuming that's a click event handler..)
[03:59:26] <sacho> nickSwe, also, the way you're using it is probably incorrect. All the click event handlers will have access to the same i(whether it's locally declared or not) - if i is locally declared, it will just be == teamMembers.length.
[04:00:47] <sacho> nickSwe, for the solution of *that* problem, /msg ecmabot last
[04:00:59] <DreamStiller> hi guys. Can have a look here: http://pastebin.com/Mg9ZeNjV . The ones with # are velocitys , i used that to create some dynamic contents. My problem here is that the jQuery couldnt generate my $Spoiler_title
[04:01:14] <DreamStiller> Can you help me find a workaround..and my coding sucks
[04:28:13] <ij> Does .each always return what's it been called upon? Even with return false from the callbacK/
[04:28:26] <Cork> eys
[04:28:29] <Cork> *yes
[04:29:00] <Cork> what you return in your function will only affect if the loop continues
[04:29:14] <ij> What's the best way to return false to submit event handler, when I'm in each callback?
[04:29:37] <sacho> what submit event handler
[04:29:42] <Cork> the best way is to not use return false to stop your event handlers
[04:29:56] <Cork> user event.preventDefault()
[04:30:20] <ij> Oh, I did event.stopPropagation.
[04:30:37] <Cork> that only prevents it from bubbling
[04:30:47] <ij> Isn't the default event in the end?
[04:30:59] <Cork> what do you mean?
[04:31:24] <sacho> no.
[04:31:25] <Industrial> Is there a leading implementation for CSS3 animations with JS fallback for .animate() ?
[04:31:31] <ij> Cork: Nevermind.
[04:32:10] <Krambiorix> hi guys, again about my ajax call, the alerts in my script are never performed, but i get data back... http://pastebin.com/q8bD23Um
[04:32:47] <Cork> Krambiorix: is the error callback called?
[04:34:15] <Krambiorix> Cork , yes.... How can i see the error? In firebug i see no error
[04:34:30] <Cork> Krambiorix: the error callback in your code?
[04:34:45] <sacho> put a breakpoint on the callback.
[04:34:57] <Cork> or an alert or console.log or....
[04:35:21] <sacho> why are you using both success and done()/
[04:35:21] <Krambiorix> Cork, sacho i wanted to log msg.data but there's nothing in there
[04:35:32] <Krambiorix> sacho, just for testing purposes
[04:35:43] <sacho> why are you alerting msg.data
[04:35:49] <Cork> Krambiorix: you arn't checking if the parsing succeeds
[04:35:56] <Cork> thats the error callback
[04:37:14] <Krambiorix> ok i changed the datatype from json to html (i receive html)-
[04:37:29] <Krambiorix> in success i alert(msg.data) but that is undefined
[04:37:43] <Cork> ya, cause your getting a string
[04:37:57] <Cork> ?g jsonlint @ Krambiorix
[04:37:58] <caniuse> Krambiorix: JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://jsonlint.com/
[04:39:50] <abhinav_singh> how do I display currency symbol ( i have ISO code for currency )
[04:40:12] <Cork> abhinav_singh: just use the unicode character
[04:40:22] <Cork> or use html entity
[04:40:39] <Krambiorix> Cork, what about jsonlint?
[04:40:50] <Cork> Krambiorix: validate your json
[04:41:24] <Krambiorix> Cork, it's just a html string
[04:45:09] <guy> https://gist.github.com/199a7eb91693763d0434
[04:45:28] <guy> This doesn't change (wrap) the element itself (by reference, so to say)
[04:45:34] <guy> how do I achieve that?
[04:45:51] <Cork> Krambiorix: if its html then you can't access "data" on it
[04:47:12] <Cork> guy: you want to add the "wrapper" to the picture?
[04:47:19] <guy> around the picture
[04:47:35] <angrauel> I have a strange issue with a jquery mobile waypoint. It does not trigger if the user lets the uiwebview bounce. Do have an idea what the uiwebview does on bounce or why it's not triggered?
[04:47:46] <guy> Cork: gnore.
[04:47:50] <guy> ignore*
[04:48:02] <Cork> guy: it takes html not a jquery element
[04:48:17] <guy> Cork: jquery element worked too.
[04:48:32] <Cork> as long as your selector only have one element
[04:48:46] <Cork> else no
[04:48:50] <guy> ya
[04:48:52] <Krambiorix> Corey, is it msg.html ?
[04:49:00] <Cork> Krambiorix: no its just msg
[04:49:02] <guy> well, it is $(this), it cannot havo more than one element.
[04:49:47] <thomas`-> Hi. I dont understand why my function that returns a jquery object such as $(this) always ends up being null when i collect the return value
[04:50:06] <Krambiorix> Cork, haha damn
[04:50:10] <Krambiorix> Cork, thx!
[04:50:40] <Cork> thomas`-: show your code
[04:52:18] <thomas`-> Right before the return its [object Object] after return its null
[04:52:43] <Cork> ?demo @ thomas`-
[04:52:52] <Cork> <_<
[04:53:01] <Cork> bah the bot is dead again :/
[04:55:05] <thomas`-> Cork, http://codepad.org/eInlOO5k
[04:55:51] <letweet> [13:53] <Cork> bah the bot is dead again :/        <<< told you not to play too hard with it :P
[04:56:02] <Cork> :)
[04:56:12] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: $(this) doesn't return anything. It's just the element's object. For example if you want to return the id of the element in question return $(this).attr('id')
[04:56:42] <Cork> thomas`-: your returning things to each, not from item_from_value
[04:57:11] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: if $() doesn't return anything, what do you think .attr works on?
[04:57:17] <Cork> :)
[04:57:21] <Cork> so yes it returns
[04:57:35] <thomas`-> ahh, true true. thanks
[04:57:41] * Cork hugs bot-t 
[04:59:22] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Woops I guess it does return something =X Thanks!
[04:59:38] <Cork> :)
[04:59:58] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: $() returns a new instance of new jQuery()
[05:00:19] <DeltaHeavy> I don't really know my OO to well >:
[05:01:13] <DeltaHeavy> Are there any advantages to using flat out JS 100% of the time as opposed to using jQuery for certain things assuming the programmer has extensive knowlege of both?
[05:01:53] <juha_> both have advantanges
[05:02:23] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: pure js is faster if you know what your doing
[05:02:25] <juha_> jquery will help you make things faster, plain js will make things faster (depending ofc)
[05:02:46] <Rainbowwww> hi :)
[05:03:25] <Sythius> i believe jquery is only good for apps
[05:04:02] <DeltaHeavy> Kinda like C vs C++ I guess? I get a lot of flack in other channels for using jQuery =/ I should learn JS but I've only been at this stuff for ~4 months incuding learning HTML/CSS/PHP
[05:04:11] <Sythius> as you need to include it in your web page it takes more time to load the library in
[05:04:18] <Rainbowwww> can someone help me with i little problem with ValidationEngine and Ajax... apperently no matter what the form just gets posted :(
[05:04:49] <Sythius> using JS instead of jquery can save you 10 times more speed of your website
[05:05:21] <juha_> Sythius: not necessarily
[05:05:50] <thomas`-> you can copy paste minified jquery into your main js file
[05:06:59] <Sythius> yer but its just javascript simplified which you can do yourself with just javascript, but i guess if you know the part of jquery you want i guess it saves speed
[05:08:44] <johnkpaul> DeltaHeavy: it's hard to make a blanket statement like "jQuery is slower than pure javascript" it always depends, and you always need to find your bottlenecks
[05:08:59] <juha_> the main benefit of jquery is to give standardized api across different browsers
[05:09:20] <johnkpaul> if you write code that does very slow things, like changing the DOM in a loop or sometrhing, jQuery isn't going to impact your performance
[05:09:21] <mindis|wurk> i'd rather argue that if jquery seems slow, you're probably doing something wrong
[05:09:22] <Sythius> jquery is definately good if you dont want a headache of javascript
[05:09:30] <johnkpaul> mindis|wurk++
[05:09:54] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks guys!
[05:09:55] <Rainbowwww> =/
[05:12:04] <hemangpatel> DeltaHeavy : you can compress js on runtime..
[05:12:17] <hemangpatel> to reduce request.
[05:12:55] <DeltaHeavy> hemangpatel: Compress it like a .zip or minify it?
[05:13:04] <hemangpatel> minify it..
[05:13:40] <Sythius> you can use mod_compress with apache servers to auto compress you files
[05:13:44] <DeltaHeavy> WHenever I release anything I always minify it and keep a dev version for myself formatted all nicly =U
[05:14:40] <Sythius> like the mod gzip
[05:16:12] <DeltaHeavy> Ok cool
[05:16:15] <Sythius> visit www.websiteoptimization.com/services/analyze/ to help you with website optimization
[05:19:05] <hemangpatel> Sythius : also there is one tool is "yslow"
[05:20:39] <mindis|wurk> the analysis produces rather amusing results since it uses a 56k modem as a minimum connection
[05:20:40] <Trisox> pagespeed
[05:20:44] <Trisox> :d
[05:21:15] <Trisox> gzip it :D combine it minimize it

[05:22:05] <nickSwe> Ok so I have tried to solve this the whole afternoon now. I cannot do it! :( Can anyone have a look at the 30 lines of code, and tell me why "memberId" always is 6? It should increment by 1 everytime the for-loop is executed, but obviously I am doing something incorrect here and I have no clue... 30 line code:      http://pastebin.com/m8paRyH1
[05:23:18] <Trisox> =+
[05:24:17] <Rainbowwww> can someone tell why the hell is jQuery not preventing a form to submit if validationError fails ?
[05:24:21] <Sythius> i prefer while loops to behonest
[05:24:33] <Trisox> nickSwe: check http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/exploring-javascript-for-in-loops/
[05:25:47] <nickSwe> Trisox: thank you will read on that. but i dont think it will do no good... the memberId is getting incremented by 1 everytime the for-loop is runned, but not when placed in the way I use it in the code. You know why?
[05:26:09] <Trisox> let me check ;)
[05:26:14] <mindis|wurk> i think it's because it actually retrieves memberid as it is after the loop in the event
[05:26:30] <mindis|wurk> i believe i made a similar mistake myself once
[05:27:36] <Trisox> true mindis|wurk
[05:27:39] <nickSwe> mindis|wurk: yeah I believe that too... but cannot figure out how to solve it so that it actually uses the current memberId while actual click, and not after the for-loop is complete (cause that will mean that memberId will be whatever the array length is)
[05:28:20] <nickSwe> so any suggestion on how I can get the current index number, and not the actual array length while click event is occuring?
[05:29:03] <mindis|wurk> one way i can think of is to put the value in a data-attribute and retrieve it when the event is triggered
[05:29:35] <nickSwe> mindis|wurk: could you give me a short example on pastebin on how you mean?
[05:29:39] <Trisox> += memberId will that work?
[05:29:44] <Trisox> in the alert
[05:29:45] <Sythius> maybe var teamMembersLength=teamMembers.length
[05:30:58] <nickSwe> hmm let me try some... perhaps I can use a different approach to it all.
[05:31:20] <mindis|wurk> nickSwe i haven't used gmap so i don't know if it can be done within it
[05:32:26] <sacho> nickSwe, /msg ecmabot last
[05:32:33] <sacho> as I suggested last time
[05:32:39] <nickSwe> mindis|wurk: ok thanks anyway
[05:33:40] <nickSwe> sacho: thanks missed that the last time... will check it out
[05:34:40] <nickSwe> sacho: that was just what I was looking for :) For anyone else involved, this is a good link: http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62/
[05:37:36] <GreyTrilby> afternoon all - trying to add username/pw system to my app - have a script to do it (which works on normal, single pages using php sessions) but can't seem to make it load in ajax requests. Can anyone point me in the right direction please?
[05:40:02] <fuchstronaut> How come fading in tablerows works fine for me, but fading out not at all?!
[05:41:03] <GreyTrilby> probably an error in the fade in syntax, causing it to break before it loads the fade out function
[05:41:29] <fuchstronaut> GreyTrilby: It dissappears, but not fading
[05:42:16] <GreyTrilby> what's the code?
[05:42:21] <Sythius> greytrilby need to see some code
[05:42:59] <GreyTrilby> sythius - for the username stuff, or the fading problem?
[05:43:21] <Sythius> for the username
[05:44:03] <fuchstronaut> GreyTrilby: $('#userList td > input[value='+data.userId+']').closest('tr').fadeOut('slow')
[05:44:10] <fuchstronaut> thats pretty much it
[05:44:44] <GreyTrilby> @fuchstronaut - looks like your selector might not be quite right
[05:45:17] <fuchstronaut> it is right.. as i said, the TR leaves my sight, but not fading
[05:46:43] <GreyTrilby> fuchstronaut - not sure then i'm afraid!
[05:46:55] <GreyTrilby> anything in the console?
[05:47:00] <fuchstronaut> not really
[05:47:05] <fuchstronaut> thanks anyway
[05:47:16] <fuchstronaut> maybe animate() can do the trick
[05:47:27] <GreyTrilby> sythius - I think it's more general concepts than precise code i'm looking for!
[05:48:04] <GreyTrilby> I've realised that passing "$loggedin=true" is a) not a good idea, and b) not going to work unless I change every link to pass it as a variable
[05:49:37] <fuchstronaut> for f*ucks sake, am I the only one having issues with how Firefox caches stuff? Ctrl+F5 didnt clear the whole cache, so my JS was still not the edited version
[05:50:07] <Sythius> so you created a username and password system using php on a single page, but your trying to send the data via ajax now?
[05:50:44] <Sythius> i never had problems with firefox, but ie on other hand was annoyingf
[05:51:05] <fuchstronaut> IE is in a league on it's own if it comes to annoying behaviour
[05:51:55] <GreyTrilby> sythius - essentially yeah. Page loads, contains a 'container' div where system pages are loaded. User not logged in. Default page is a login page (loaded via ajax). enter user & pass (calling same php page) but on clicking another link to load a new page into the container, it's like the session isn't there any more
[05:52:17] <GreyTrilby> IE caching drives me mad.
[05:52:39] <EdwardIII> hey
[05:52:47] <Sythius> ajax and session i remember they were annoying, let me think a sec lol
[05:52:54] <GreyTrilby> cheers!
[05:53:03] <EdwardIII> i'm trying to get the height of some images, but during $(document).load(... they're showing up as height: 0px
[05:53:03] <FiXion> how do I replace content in a certain li with class name menu-1678 ?
[05:53:11] <FiXion> I've tried $(document).ready(function() { $("li.menu-1678").load("http://www.vsen.dk/files/test.php"); });
[05:53:17] <FiXion> (where the url - returns the text 'test' and nothing else)
[05:53:40] <fuchstronaut> Sythius, GreyTrilby: Actually the server can't see if you are ajaxing or not, so it shouldn't be a problem
[05:53:40] <EdwardIII> tried wrapping in $('body').ready(... but no joy: $('body').ready(function(){ set_gallery_height(); });
[05:53:54] <FiXion> but nothing happens to the li
[05:54:14] <GreyTrilby> FiXion - are you trying to load from a remote server?
[05:54:24] <fuchstronaut> EdwardIII: It is $(function(){ //your code });
[05:54:47] <EdwardIII> fuchstronaut: but i think i need to fire on window load not dom ready?
[05:54:48] <fuchstronaut> FiXion: html() and text() are your methods to manipulate content
[05:54:57] <EdwardIII> and $(func... loads on DOM ready doesn't it?
[05:55:20] <fuchstronaut> EdwardIII: It does, isn't that soon enough for you?
[05:55:44] <EdwardIII> fuchstronaut: doesn't seem to be. if i wrap in a 3 sec timer instead of $(... i get the real height (150px)
[05:55:57] <EdwardIII> is there a way i can bind later?
[05:56:00] <Sythius> greytrilby: yes fuch is right, it should not be a problem, i always forgot to session_start() lol
[05:56:00] <FiXion> GreyTrilby: yes. just for testing. could it be that it's from another server ?
[05:56:18] <EdwardIII> good nickname though
[05:56:58] <fuchstronaut> EdwardIII: have you tried: http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[05:57:33] <EdwardIII> fuchstronaut: yes just this very second and it did the trick, thanks
[05:57:51] <FiXion> GreyTrilby: tried chaning to relative url /test.php on same site.
[05:57:52] <EdwardIII> fuchstronaut: i kept turning up the ajax .load, so thought this was the wrong method
[05:57:58] <FiXion> didn't change anything.
[05:59:20] <Sythius> greytrilby: can you paste ajax request and the php in www.pastebin.com
[05:59:25] <FiXion> fuchstronaut: so $('selector').load(url) is not a way to do it?
[05:59:32] <EdwardIII> or literally any other pastebin but that
[06:00:04] <GreyTrilby> sythius - it's a lot of pages. I think I may have missed something in my subsequent page loads
[06:00:09] <Sythius> i dont know pasting websites, whats a good one?
[06:00:09] <GreyTrilby> gimme a few :)
[06:00:15] <Trisox> coldhead
[06:00:15] <caniuse> Trisox: coldhead: a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[06:00:18] <GreyTrilby> I ususally use jsfiddle
[06:00:26] <Trisox> do it
[06:00:36] <fuchstronaut> FiXion: if I understood you right, no, if you want to change the content of an element, let's say a DIV, html() and text() provide what you need
[06:01:06] <fuchstronaut> jsfiddle is great, for simple code pastebin does the job i think
[06:01:51] <FiXion> fuchstronaut: will they load the content remotely ? or should they be combined with .post ?
[06:01:52] <GreekFreak> hi all
[06:02:05] <FiXion> I also tried: $(document).ready(function(){ $.post("http://www.vsen.dk/files/test.php", function(data) { $("li.menu-1678").html(data); }); });
[06:02:12] <FiXion> but that didn't work either
[06:02:38] <GreekFreak> Does .find() return an array of elements? I thought yes, but then the .val() method is undefined when I iterate through the result of .find()
[06:04:29] <FiXion> anyone see an error with this: $(document).ready(function(){ $.post("/sites/all/modules/test/test.php", function(data) { $("li.menu-1678").html(data); }); }); ?
[06:05:01] <fuchstronaut> do you see an error in your console?
[06:05:15] <fuchstronaut> i recommend using $.ajax with some very basic settings
[06:05:18] <fuchstronaut> makes it easier
[06:05:23] <fuchstronaut> imho
[06:05:38] <Sythius> $.ajax({
[06:05:38] <Sythius>   type: 'POST',
[06:05:38] <Sythius>   url: url,
[06:05:38] <Sythius>   data: data,
[06:05:39] <Sythius>   success: success,
[06:05:39] <Sythius>   dataType: dataType
[06:05:40] <Sythius> });
[06:05:48] <johnathanb> Sythius: Stop it.
[06:05:55] <johnathanb> Gist or gtfo
[06:05:56] <Sythius> lol oops o did that by accident
[06:06:02] <Sythius> sorry
[06:06:07] <johnathanb> Aye. I do it all the time :P
[06:06:10] <Vainoharhainen> I'm playing with historyjs + ajax, when i click on a article in my article archive they code loads in the article with ajax and change the url. But when i refresh the page and try to use the back button nothing happends. Any ideas? http://pastebin.com/npnzB2gg (I use this code on my article archive..)
[06:06:14] <Sythius> lol
[06:06:21] <GreyTrilby> sythius - I have a sneaky suspicion I've just been very very stupid (and not for the first time!).
[06:06:43] <Sythius> trust me it happens alot lol
[06:07:06] <GreyTrilby> sythius - designed whole system and am adding login at the end - looks like I need to now go through about 70 php pages and add the 'check login' include function
[06:07:10] <GreyTrilby> \me faceplams
[06:07:11] <FiXion> it says  $ is not a function
[06:07:15] * GreyTrilby facepalms
[06:07:59] <DeltaHeavy> FiXion: Is jQuery loaded before the script in question? Is the <script> tag above the script in question?
[06:08:36] <DeltaHeavy> FiXion: If it is make sure jQuery is loading properly. You can test this by putting this at the top (line 1) of your script: alert(typeof.jQuery);
[06:08:42] <Sythius> greytrilby i can give a php example if you want, i havn't got a jquery example, i have a javascript one though
[06:08:43] <DeltaHeavy> If it returns 'function' it's loaded
[06:08:56] <FiXion> DeltaHeavy: it's on a Drupal site - which loads a lot of other jquery things (which works fine)
[06:09:33] <DeltaHeavy> FiXion: I'd still try that alert though just to utterly rule it out completley. Don't know why else it wouldn't recognize '$' as a function.
[06:10:00] <FiXion> DeltaHeavy: I'll test.. thanks
[06:10:09] <DeltaHeavy> np
[06:10:58] <fuchstronaut> I just got a call, as it turns out, I added some time a go a debug message "go fuck yourself", now this deubg message popped up somewhere as error message for the user
[06:11:01] <fuchstronaut> this is just great
[06:12:05] <Sythius> greytrilby would you  like an example?
[06:12:24] <GreyTrilby> sythius - i wouldn't say no - knowledge is power & all that...
[06:12:37] <GreyTrilby> (sorry - wife has me running in and out to help with lunch) - shitty timing!
[06:12:49] <Sythius> just my motto lol
[06:13:23] <FiXion> DeltaHeavy: tried: http://pastie.org/4210066 - it says syntax error
[06:14:58] <DeltaHeavy> Fixion: Span your statements across multiple lines, repost and tell me what line number unless it's 2 or 4 in which that case you could just tell me right now
[06:16:19] <GreekFreak> Guys, I can't seem to figure out how to iterate through each of the elements to get the value, after running this: for i=0 i<checked_company_types.length; i++
[06:16:19] <GreekFreak>   console.log(i + " - " + checked_company_types[i].val())
[06:16:36] <ajpiano> FiXion: typeof jQuery, not typeof.jQuery
[06:16:42] <FiXion> DeltaHeavy: it points specificly to alert(typeof.jQuery);
[06:16:43] <GreekFreak> ^^Sorry. my bad. wrong paste :/
[06:17:04] <GreekFreak> I can't seem to figure out how to iterate through each of the elements to get the value, after running this:    checked_company_types = company_types_edit.find("input[name='card_company_type_ids[]'][checked='checked']")
[06:17:41] <FiXion> ajpiano: thanks. fixed that.
[06:17:46] <FiXion> not it doesn't complain about syntax query
[06:17:51] <FiXion> only that $ is not a function
[06:17:54] <FiXion> and no alert is coming up
[06:17:55] <fuchstronaut> GreekFreak: .each(function(){ $(this).val(); })
[06:17:59] <ajpiano> so jQuery isn't loaded
[06:18:18] <FiXion> ajpiano: is. I just think the javascript isn't being run
[06:18:20] <GreekFreak> fuchstronaut, I
[06:18:24] <ajpiano> FiXion: it obviously isn't.
[06:18:35] <ajpiano> otherwise you wouldn't be getting "$ is not a function"
[06:18:41] <GreekFreak> fuchstronaut, I'll try it again, but last time it complained about val() being undefined
[06:19:15] <DeltaHeavy> FiXion: http://jsfiddle.net/7vXZY/
[06:19:59] <GreekFreak> fuchstronaut, thanx. I was trying to iterate it with .each as if it was an array and it wasn't working :P
[06:20:06] <fuchstronaut> GreekFreak: inputfields have values, other elements don't, so check what oyu are calling the mathod on
[06:20:09] <FiXion> but why is it failing: http://pastie.org/4210108
[06:20:24] <ajpiano> FiXion: you really don't need all that CDATA and other html comment crap in there
[06:20:43] <FiXion> these three are copied from a long list of javascript. the top one has non complaints in the console. the $progressbar one - gives same complaint - but progressbars works fine it seems.
[06:20:53] <GreekFreak> fuchstronaut, thanx
[06:20:57] <FiXion> ajpiano: it's a Drupal std. thing - when I use drupal_add_js
[06:21:07] <ajpiano> FiXion: notice that the first one uses jQuery and the second two use $
[06:21:18] <ajpiano> try using jQuery instead of $ in all three
[06:21:28] <FiXion> ajpiano: I'll try that. thanks
[06:21:34] <Trisox> hey ajpiano
[06:21:38] <ajpiano> hi Trisox
[06:21:43] <Trisox> hows life
[06:21:49] <Trisox> ltns
[06:22:33] <EdwardIII> i'm using a horrible javascript/ajaxy page loading framework that has it's own custom loader event, jQuery('body').bind('mpage-loaded', function(){
[06:22:46] <EdwardIII> how can i ensure my own code gets executed either on dom load or on their event nicely?
[06:23:04] <EdwardIII> if the visitor hits the page directly it doesn't trigger mpage-loaded
[06:23:13] <sacho> umm
[06:23:19] <ajpiano> Trisox: it's good
[06:23:21] <GreekFreak> fuchstronaut, it keeps complaining here,       checked_company_type_ids.push($(this).val())    but it wasn't complaining when I did console.log($(this).val())
[06:23:36] <Trisox> good to hear
[06:23:42] <sacho> var mycode = function() { ...} $('body').on('mpage-loaded', mycode); $(document).ready(mycode);
[06:24:00] <fuchstronaut> GreekFreak: can you get a jsfiddle up?
[06:24:06] <EdwardIII> sacho: hrm thought mycode might get exec twice? maybe not, will TIAS
[06:24:21] <sacho> EdwardIII, then add a variable to check if it's already executed
[06:24:25] <fuchstronaut> I think it's something with your context, so this points to another element
[06:24:25] <FiXion> ajpiano: I modified $ to jQuery - but it's still not run. a breakpoint on it doesn't hit. whereas a breakpoint on the #tabs script stops there
[06:25:04] <ajpiano> ?cik @ FiXion
[06:25:06] <bot-t> FiXion, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[06:26:58] <Sythius> greytrilby?
[06:27:05] <GreyTrilby> si - i'm here!
[06:27:09] <EdwardIII> sacho: thanks, rolled with that, was just wondering if there was a sexier way, guess not for now!
[06:27:13] <EdwardIII> well, i guess the sexier way is jquery mobile
[06:27:26] <Sythius> i added a link in private chat, thought it would be easier for you
[06:27:30] <GreyTrilby> I *think* i've got it working, actually - but would be interesting to see if there's a better way of doing it. Which there probably is!
[06:27:37] <GreyTrilby> ahh... thank you! - will have a look!
[06:27:46] <sacho> EdwardIII, the sexier way would be to not have two possible entry points
[06:28:02] <sacho> EdwardIII, here's another solution
[06:28:09] <EdwardIII> wicked, now that breaks $(window).load(func
[06:28:29] <sacho> $('body').on('mpage-loaded', mycode); $(document).ready(function() { $('body').trigger('mpage-loaded'); })
[06:28:36] <sacho> (of course, that depends on wtf mpage-loaded does.
[06:29:07] <GreekFreak> fuchstronaut, problem was elsewhere. I did need the iteration though, thanx :)
[06:29:34] <sacho> EdwardIII, why isn't mpage-loaded being called every time?
[06:29:51] <sacho> If you want to execute only on mpage-loaded, then add your handlers there, and make sure it's triggered every time
[06:29:59] <sacho> (eg by triggering it yourself when applicable)
[06:31:47] <FiXion> my test site works.. now to figure out what the difference is..
[06:31:47] <zulu-gula> I animate margin of element, so it changes from 100px to 0px. After animation element has margin 0px, but I would like to remove this property from element (so I could apply margin from class). how can I do it?
[06:32:40] <gaspyr> can u give a snippet ?
[06:33:18] <gaspyr> cuz when the animation is over, everything gets reseted
[06:33:37] <EdwardIII> sacho: i'm not sure why it isn't triggered every time
[06:33:39] <FiXion> ajpiano: DeltaHeavy: thanks for your help. now it works in my test atleast :)
[06:33:49] <EdwardIII> sacho: just looking to stop-gap until i can replace it with jquery mobile tbh
[06:34:01] <zulu-gula> gaspyr:  I animate inline style: margin-left, so after animation it has inline style: margin-left  = 0px
[06:34:19] <zulu-gula> or I should ask different: how to remove inline styles of element?
[06:34:53] <gaspyr> well i hate inline styles, but anyway u can use the .removeAttr()
[06:35:05] <karolyi> does anyone know a good jquery history handler plugin? pushstate with fallback to hashtags?
[06:35:17] <zulu-gula> this inline style becomes after animation
[06:35:48] <gaspyr> jQuery .removeAttr( String attributeName ) //Description: Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements.
[06:36:33] <zulu-gula> tx
[06:36:42] <gaspyr> yw :)
[06:38:36] <sacho> if you set a style to '' it'll be removed from the style attr
[06:39:06] <sacho> removeAttr() is for attributes, not css styles.
[06:43:25] <granden> Hi, I get this in my console, Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ,
[06:43:46] <granden> Any idea how to start to error searching that? I understand the message but how do I find that unexpected toen?
[06:46:29] <sacho> granden, the error message should show which line it has occured on.
[06:47:52] * n3rdo hi all
[06:47:58] <granden> sacho: Oh
[06:48:01] <thomas`-> When I do element1.appendTo(element2) why does element display:none change to display:block?
[06:48:01] <granden> missed that
[06:49:33] <Vainoharhainen> http://nojjan.nu/historyjs/index2.php When i press on a article then refrehs the whole page and press the back button nothing happends.. any ideas?
[06:52:11] <nmee> I am looping through all table rows using $('table tr') - are the rows I am iterating over evaluated only when initially called? I want to add/remove rows while in the loop itself, is this OK to do?
[06:52:50] <nmee> I will not delete rows not yet iterated over, only the current row. I will add additional rows before the current row.
[06:53:48] <ajpiano> nmee: that set will not be modified during the iteration
[06:53:50] <ajpiano> fret not
[06:54:17] <nmee> ajpiano: great, thanks!
[06:55:08] <fusion27> noob question: I've got a JS object here (http://pastie.org/4210263) and in my script, I've got 'maj_core' and want to return 'Major Core' by interrogating this object, how do I do that?
[06:57:36] <nmee> fusion27: use underscore, it's awesome
[06:58:05] <fusion27> http://underscorejs.org/
[06:58:05] <fusion27> ?
[06:58:18] <nmee> fusion27: _.find(thisCourseTypedata, function(x){ return x.id == 'maj_core'; }).text
[06:58:22] <nmee> yes
[06:58:48] <fusion27> so there's no jquery one-liner for this?
[06:58:57] <nmee> it has a bunch of very useful array/object utilities
[06:59:06] <fusion27> I guess so!!
[06:59:09] <nmee> jquery is mostly for working with DOM and the UI if I understand correctly
[06:59:14] <nmee> while your problem above is pure JS
[06:59:27] <fusion27> I never heard of underscore.... very cool!
[07:00:48] <nmee> while it wouldn't be that difficult to solve in pure JS, using underscore has made me much more productive
[07:01:14] <nmee> From their site: "It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux, and Backbone.js's suspenders." :)
[07:02:13] <FiXion> hmm. for someodd reason - I couldn't use $.post (it kept saying - in Drupal website only - $ is undefined) - but jQuery('selector').load worked (whereas $.load didn't either.
[07:02:52] <FiXion> $.post worked fine on simple test html
[07:03:09] <FiXion> and $('selector').load as well
[07:03:20] <nmee> FiXion: perhaps other JS libraries are conflicting with the $ identifier?
[07:03:21] <dabear> FiXion: drupal most likely overrides $ or uses .noConflict to remove it totally
[07:03:27] <Space-Duck> How can I make this animation smoother? http://jsfiddle.net/Cn8H5/
[07:03:55] <dabear> FiXion: (function($){  your code here })(jQuery)
[07:04:15] <FiXion> dabear: that would explain it
[07:04:29] <nmee> Space-Duck: smoothly animating table rows/cells is apparently a pain... fadeOut() works with table cells, but it's not quite the same as slideUp
[07:04:31] <bencahill> Hey guys, what is this notation: { 'foo': 'bar', 'bla': 'whatev' } ?
[07:04:55] <dabear> bencahill: that is an object literal
[07:05:33] <dabear> it can also be a string containing jsondata
[07:05:43] <dabear> hm, or not
[07:05:54] <dabear> needs doubles: " not '
[07:06:04] <edupoch> Space-Duck: you can use animate() with that row width
[07:06:15] <edupoch> sorry, height
[07:06:45] <Space-Duck> edupoch, the height is a variable
[07:07:56] <lolhii> Any way to animate a progress bar for how long it takes to receive a value from a PHP form page?
[07:08:18] <fusion27> wow, there really isn't a jQuery one liner for this... mind boggling!!
[07:08:39] <lolhii> fusion27: for my query?
[07:09:02] <fusion27> sorry lolhii, for this one
[07:09:02] <fusion27> I've got a JS object here (http://pastie.org/4210263) and in my script, I've got 'maj_core' and want to return 'Major Core' by interrogating this object, how do I do that?
[07:10:43] <dabear> fusion27: that's not a task jquery should solve
[07:11:23] <fusion27> yeah, I'm still a super JS noob
[07:13:14] <bencahill> dabear: Thanks a bunch!
[07:13:46] <dabear> fusion27: ..and there is a one liner :p
[07:14:11] <dabear> but I generally prefer making code readable rather than dense
[07:14:13] <fusion27> dabear: break one off for a brother!!
[07:14:28] <fusion27> just for my own edification and cheap thrills
[07:14:42] <EdwardIII> mapmapmap
[07:15:17] <dabear> fusion27: $(thisCourseTypedata).filter( function( ){ return this.id == "maj_core"}  ).prop("text");
[07:15:25] <fusion27> prop
[07:15:29] <fusion27> first time I've seen that one
[07:16:40] <fusion27> dabear: you get a gold star today
[07:16:52] <fusion27> thank you!!!
[07:16:55] <dabear> lol, can I cash it in?
[07:17:31] <warrenparsons> On what element is "text" a property?
[07:18:08] <fusion27> Are you anywhere near northeast Ohio, USA?  I'll redeem that star for a very cold beer
[07:18:47] <dabear> warrenparsons: on that custom object literal
[07:18:51] <warrenparsons> Ah-ha.
[07:19:23] <warrenparsons> fusion27: Where in Ohio? I'm in Toledo.
[07:19:48] <fusion27> Akron, the university of
[07:19:56] <warrenparsons> Cool.
[07:20:15] <fusion27> yeah, neat, I didn't expect anyone in here to be even remotely close to here
[07:21:13] <Posterdati> hi
[07:21:14] <Posterdati> please I need help to make galleriffic works in a jquery dialog

[07:26:53] <bot-t> dabear, Changed "dabear's location".
[07:26:59] <dabear> ?weather
[07:27:01] <bot-t> dabear, Trondheim, Sr-Trndelag - Weather: Cloudy, 22C / 72F
[07:28:30] <warrenparsons> I don't think Trondheim is in the greater Cleveland/Akron area...
[07:28:52] <hooloovoo> ?botsnack
[07:28:53] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[07:29:23] <dabear> I guess not
[07:29:25] <edupoch> Space-Duck: I know it's very poorly coded, but take a look at the way I use row height, animate() and overflow:hidden http://jsfiddle.net/Cn8H5/
[07:30:08] <^rcaskey> hey all, what IRC client are all the cool mac-owning kids using these days?
[07:30:29] <silverwind> I use colloquy :/
[07:30:33] <warrenparsons> ^rcaskey: I use Colloquy
[07:30:45] <djbpython> Hi all, ive got a checkbox with an onclick attribute, i'd like to set the checkbox to checked and run the onclick function, however if I just do .click() it runs it's logic and THEN checks the box, so the click function thinks the box isnt checked
[07:31:16] <macabre> ^rcaskey: i use limechat :)
[07:31:26] <warrenparsons> djbpython: $('.myCheckboxClass').prop('checked', true).trigger('click');
[07:31:28] <^rcaskey> but are you cool?
[07:31:34] <macabre> ^rcaskey: not even close
[07:31:36] * ^rcaskey inspects to check for horned-rimmed glasses
[07:32:17] <EdwardIII> mac user = horned-rimmed
[07:32:25] <warrenparsons> djbpython: However that will probably leave it unclicked when everything is done.
[07:32:26] <^rcaskey> got a designer that's never used IRC before
[07:32:41] <^rcaskey> and I told him, grab xchat-gnome and he was like wuh...and I was like...oh yeah...
[07:32:53] <warrenparsons> djbpython: Or unchecked, rather, since the final click unchecks it.
[07:33:08] <edupoch> Space-Duck: sorry, i gave you the wrong url http://jsfiddle.net/Cn8H5/2/
[07:33:21] <djbpython> warrenparsons: yup, exactly
[07:33:29] <dabear> ^rcaskey: cool mac users is self contradictory
[07:33:57] <warrenparsons> djbpython: Are you just trying to set it to checked and then run the function that is normally *triggered* by a click, without actually changing the state with that click event?
[07:34:18] <^rcaskey> honestly I can't fault anyone for buying a MBP if they need to work on the go
[07:34:39] <^rcaskey> you want big pixel count on a laptop, you got one choice
[07:34:46] * warrenparsons is a Mac user and is exceedingly uncool.
[07:34:47] <dabear> meh, I'm typign from an mba my self
[07:35:08] <djbpython> warrenparsons: err, yes, it should check the box and run the click function and the click function shouldn't uncheck the box and should be in a state where it thinks the box is checked
[07:35:11] <djbpython> if that makes sense
[07:35:24] <dabear> I prefer quassel for my irc needs
[07:35:47] <dabear> as I can connect to my quassel core from where I want
[07:36:11] <dabear> kinda like a gui version of screen + irssi
[07:36:18] <warrenparsons> djbpython: Then I would make a named function that does what you want, and separately fire that function on normal click event. Then you can do, as a separate case, $('.myCheckboxClass').prop('checked', true); myNewNamedFunction();
[07:37:03] <warrenparsons> djbpython: And your default click handler would be $('input[type="checkbox"]').on('click', myNewNamedFunction());
[07:37:20] <djbpython> warrenparsons: ah, but the trick is, the onclick is actually set by my web framework (Lift) so i dont know what it will be
[07:37:25] <warrenparsons> Ahh.
[07:37:26] <warrenparsons> Ouch.
[07:37:33] <boulet101010> http://jsfiddle.net/f8CC9/ need help with selectors
[07:37:57] <djbpython> only thing i can come up with is set the attr, fire the click, set the attr again
[07:38:46] <warrenparsons> djbpython: Yeah, not great but you may have to live with it if you can't address the function independently. And if you're using a recent jQuery version, use .prop() for checked rather than .attr() since it is a boolean property.
[07:39:07] <boulet101010> found it
[07:39:21] <djbpython> warrenparsons: sure thing, thats for the help
[07:39:29] <warrenparsons> djbpython: Sure thing.
[07:39:41] <miniBill> I've got this code -> http://ideone.com/i3Mmz
[07:40:10] <miniBill> It runs almost fine, except that when the click function is invoked buybtn is bound to the last button in the each enumeration
[07:40:22] <miniBill> I'd like it to bind to the currect element
[07:40:27] <miniBill> how can I do that?
[07:42:17] <nmee> Hi, is it possible to somehow get the original background value of an element, regardless of any running animations?
[07:42:39] <nmee> I want to get the 'default' background color, despite the current background color being yellow (during a highlight effect)
[07:43:22] <gwinh_dev> before animation, get the default and store it in a global variable
[07:43:59] <miniBill> ugh
[07:44:25] <dabear> nmee: sure
[07:47:08] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, what opensource deployment tool do you use?
[07:48:07] <xmaddness> mvn
[07:48:22] <xmaddness> and bamboo
[07:48:29] <silverwind> mvn for the win
[07:48:35] <xmaddness> indeed
[07:48:52] <d3f4ultr0> can i use mvn to deploy php, css and js?
[07:48:56] <xmaddness> yes
[07:49:02] <d3f4ultr0> ok
[07:49:06] <silverwind> I use it for java though :P
[07:49:14] <xmaddness> you can create a custom pom to do pretty much anything you want
[07:49:26] <d3f4ultr0> k
[07:49:28] <xmaddness> yeah qwe use it for our java services also
[07:49:34] <d3f4ultr0> steep learning curve?
[07:49:43] <xmaddness> um, perhaps, but worth it
[07:49:51] <xmaddness> its enterprise level
[07:49:54] <tubbo`work> you should probably use capistrano
[07:49:55] <silverwind> If it doesn't support repository for PHP... MVN won't be that good..
[07:49:55] <tubbo`work> not maven
[07:50:03] <xmaddness> so you can go far with the knowledge
[07:50:12] <tubbo`work> https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki
[07:50:13] <d3f4ultr0> k
[07:50:27] <tubbo`work> it's designed for rails apps but basically works with anything that has a repository and shell access
[07:50:39] <d3f4ultr0> k
[07:50:42] <tubbo`work> much easier than maven, uses ruby rather than java/xml/bullshit, and isn't enterprise-level, it's really meant for smaller projects
[07:50:53] <silverwind> Let's be honest, the good way to deploy PHP is an ugly custom made shell script :P
[07:50:59] <xmaddness> =\
[07:51:15] <tubbo`work> "deploy PHP" can be done by uploading files to a server or simply ssh'ing in and running `svn up` or `git pull`.
[07:51:21] <xmaddness> with maven and bamboo I can click a button and auto deploy
[07:51:21] <silverwind> My point.
[07:51:29] <tubbo`work> that's not much work lol
[07:51:31] <silverwind> PHP is a world of mediocrity
[07:51:32] <d3f4ultr0> that;s what I'm currently doing. Maybe I should stick to it
[07:51:32] <miniBill> you could setup a git hook
[07:51:49] <xmaddness> tubbo`work: when you get to an enterprise level, it certainly is
[07:51:51] <miniBill> that way you simply merge into master and push
[07:52:04] <xmaddness> especially with 150+ devs all doing side by side deploys to 50+ environments
[07:52:13] <tubbo`work> d3f4ultr0: capistrano's great because it keeps backups of your old code on the server. you can easily roll back to any specific point
[07:52:25] <d3f4ultr0> i'm currently using rsync over ssh in dev servers. It's so friggin quick
[07:52:34] <tubbo`work> but if you're not updating the app all that often i wouldn't bother with it
[07:52:37] <d3f4ultr0> i'll check out capistrano
[07:52:43] <tubbo`work> that's the ticket for small stuff definitely
[07:52:49] <miniBill> anyone on my question?
[07:52:56] <xmaddness> true, I guess I have a skewed opinion
[07:53:01] <tubbo`work> xmaddness: enterprise bleh ;)
[07:53:10] <xmaddness> :P
[07:53:17] <tubbo`work> but yeah maven is def. the prime candidate for that environment
[07:53:27] <tubbo`work> i've had to work with maven on smaller scales and it's not pretty
[07:53:27] <shoky> miniBill: yea
[07:53:41] <xmaddness> right, but it -could- do the job though
[07:53:44] <tubbo`work> totally
[07:53:45] <silverwind> tubbo`work, What? I'd use maven even for a 2 liners :P
[07:53:48] <xmaddness> if you have a devops team to keep it all up
[07:53:51] <xmaddness> :D
[07:53:58] <shoky> miniBill: but i dont udnerstand what you meant
[07:54:04] <tubbo`work> silverwind: please go down to the nearest mental hospital and check yourself in. you are insane. ;-)
[07:54:27] <silverwind> tubbo`work, mvn generated 99% of the XML crap for you :/
[07:54:40] <miniBill> shoky: when the click() function gets called it uses the last possible value for buybtn. how can I make it use the value for buybtn that was set at the time of the function creation?
[07:54:50] <silverwind> tubbo`work, You add a dependency or two... then mvn package :P
[07:55:14] <tubbo`work> silverwind: just kidding...it was really a case of "i don't know what i'm doing and nobody else on the team does either so blah this sucks". if i was on a devops team with 100s of other maven experts i'd probably appreciate it more. but i really just don't know what i'm doing with it.
[07:55:21] <shoky> miniBill : ah, you might wanna add 'var' before buybtn on line 4
[07:55:38] <tubbo`work> silverwind: right, since most of my projects these days are in Ruby i've just been using Bundler. never had to learn Maven.
[07:55:47] <tubbo`work> i think the only reason i used it was to build Red5
[07:55:52] <silverwind> tubbo`work, I never used ruby  :P
[07:56:04] <tubbo`work> silverwind: are you from javaland>
[07:56:06] <shoky> miniBill: otherwise you're referring 'buybtn' in a wider scope
[07:56:10] <miniBill> shoky: aaaah
[07:56:12] <tubbo`work> s/>/?
[07:56:15] <miniBill> shoky: /me is a javascript noob :D
[07:56:27] <miniBill> shoky: that was probably the problem, thanks :D
[07:56:29] <shoky> ;P
[07:56:34] <silverwind> silverwind, more or less.. java/C#/C++/Javascript/CSS/HTML/Python/PHP land :/
[07:56:37] <silverwind> Err
[07:56:39] <tubbo`work> haha
[07:56:42] <tubbo`work> self-mention there :D
[07:56:43] <silverwind> Talking to myself... win
[07:56:45] <tubbo`work> lol
[07:56:50] <cusco> hello
[07:57:19] <cusco> Im using a tooltip script based on jquery, 'aToolTip' or something, anyway it works just as needed but...
[07:57:23] * miniBill comes from c#/java
[07:57:27] <dabear_> miniBill: easiest solution: http://jsfiddle.net/uRB4U/5/
[07:57:29] <tubbo`work> yeah i used to use php a lot at my last job. problem was less about the language (even though it's awful, and i should know, i've been using it for over 10 years) and more about how my company was living in the past
[07:57:51] <asher^> anyone know how i can keep contenteditable functionality within a jquery ui sortable?
[07:57:58] <cusco> I need to generate a number of html elements... each will be having a different tooltip, OnClick !!!, each will have a unique id
[07:58:05] <asher^> it seems to be hijacking the onmousedown event
[07:58:07] <tubbo`work> silverwind: if you have a lot of java experience maven is awesome, but sadly i was never a part of the java community. i just learned it in high school as the language behind my AP compsci classes
[07:58:09] <miniBill> dabear_: yeah, I was missing var
[07:58:14] <cusco> how do I call a jquery tooltip on each element ??
[07:58:24] <tubbo`work> i wasn't working in development at the time java got real popular
[07:58:24] <silverwind> tubbo`work, Must have been an awful experience :P
[07:58:49] <tubbo`work> silverwind: it had its pro's & cons. certainly less stressful, but i made less money and i wasn't as happy b/c i couldn't work with the tools i loved.
[07:58:53] <xmaddness> PHP is good in the right hands
[07:59:02] <silverwind> No it's not.
[07:59:03] <xmaddness> but it can get aweful in the wrong hands
[07:59:04] <tubbo`work> plus i was working with my friends and i love them so everything was cool
[07:59:09] * xmaddness does shakey fists
[07:59:10] <tubbo`work> haha, i'm a good php developer :)
[07:59:36] <dabear_> any developer that needs to say that on irc, is a bad developer
[07:59:37] <dabear_> :(
[07:59:45] * xmaddness has been doing "webdev" for 20 years now
[07:59:49] <tubbo`work> look guys, php isn't nearly as featureless as javascript. so if we can make awesome apps with javascript, we can at least make functional apps with php.
[07:59:55] <silverwind> xmaddness, it is possible for a good programmer to use a bad tool like PHP and create something good with it.... but why not use a good tool instead and create something even better?
[07:59:58] <tubbo`work> javascript is just a fuck you language
[08:00:22] <xmaddness> silverwind: a good tool such as/
[08:00:23] <tubbo`work> "oh, you want classes? FUCK YOU!", "oh, you want backtraces? FUCK YOU!", "oh, you don't understand me? FUCK YOU!"
[08:00:31] <xmaddness> if you say C# i'ma slap you :P
[08:00:38] <tubbo`work> silverwind: +1
[08:00:43] <tubbo`work> xmaddness: ruby?
[08:00:46] <silverwind> xmaddness, anything else :(
[08:00:46] <tubbo`work> python?
[08:00:48] <tubbo`work> shit, perl?!
[08:00:54] <xmaddness> for web? lol
[08:00:54] <silverwind> Yeah.. even Perl
[08:01:07] <xmaddness> php is good for front end ui
[08:01:10] <silverwind> Modern Perl isn't that horrible.
[08:01:23] <xmaddness> we don't use it to connect to any db's though
[08:01:32] <xmaddness> that lays on our backend java services
[08:01:37] <silverwind> xmaddness, What's nice with PHP is not the language itself, but the ease of installation and the quick feedback loop you get with it.
[08:02:08] <silverwind> With java... unless you use something like jRebel.. it's a PITA to do frontend
[08:02:17] <xmaddness> right
[08:02:33] <xmaddness> that why we just run the services via java, and the front end with php
[08:02:43] <tubbo`work> perl was the ORIGINAL server-side scripting language
[08:02:54] <tubbo`work> back before PHP it used to be either compiled C programs run under CGI or Perl scripts
[08:03:07] <xmaddness> the good ole days?
[08:03:08] <silverwind> xmaddness++
[08:03:11] <tubbo`work> haha
[08:03:12] <tubbo`work> nope
[08:03:20] * xmaddness would not want to go back there
[08:03:24] <tubbo`work> in fact, PHP was heralded as amazing when it came out (and it was!) because you didn't have to fuck with CGI
[08:04:00] <tubbo`work> i would like to see PHP as a purely functional language
[08:04:14] <tubbo`work> no objecfts
[08:04:21] <xmaddness> =\
[08:04:24] <tubbo`work> none of that bullshit huge function library, just a small stdlib
[08:04:34] <xmaddness> oh man
[08:04:43] <xmaddness> if that were the case we souldn't be using it
[08:04:45] <tubbo`work> that way it would be easy to deploy small scripts that were super efficient, and would feel like programming in something like lisp
[08:04:59] <xmaddness> tubbo`work: yeah but our codebase is HUGE
[08:05:03] <tubbo`work> why? it would be perfect for little apps
[08:05:09] <xmaddness> I couldn't imagine going back to that
[08:05:11] <tubbo`work> nah it's not designed for huge codebases
[08:05:29] <tubbo`work> and it wouldn't even *be* PHP, it would be a language that felt like it. or at least deployed like it.
[08:05:33] <xmaddness> its like, we'd be going back to a waterfall python based approach
[08:05:33] <xmaddness> ick
[08:05:40] <tubbo`work> i don't have a huge problem with PHP's syntax, i hate the way its stdlib is designed...
[08:05:43] <Falcon`> tubbo`work, no? facebook, man :P
[08:05:44] <silverwind> PHP is okay for small CRUD app...
[08:05:59] <silverwind> You can't mess up things that much in those apps
[08:06:01] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: facebook is a lot more than PHP.
[08:06:07] <Falcon`> but it's mostly PHP
[08:06:10] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: and that comment was about a hypothetical language that doesn't exist
[08:06:12] <tubbo`work> no, it's not
[08:06:17] <xmaddness> silverwind: ours is definetly not small :P
[08:06:19] <tubbo`work> it's mostly C++
[08:06:20] <silverwind> Nothing important on facebook is written with PHP AFAIK
[08:06:20] <bot-t> While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of subjective opinions about PHP is off-topic for this channel, so let's please move on.
[08:06:36] <silverwind> It's all Erlang/C++/Java
[08:06:36] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: there was a great article about it by a guy who actually asked FB engineers posted on hacker news yesterday
[08:06:43] * xmaddness moves on
[08:06:50] <Falcon`> link it then please
[08:07:03] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: it's mostly C++ and PHP is used solely for the frontend. i *believe* that PHP is used purely becuase that's what FB started with
[08:07:09] <tubbo`work> not because it's the best tool for the job
[08:07:28] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: http://framethink.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/how-facebook-ships-code/
[08:08:00] <tubbo`work> wait that may not be it
[08:09:09] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: but realize that Facebook has like a bajillion engineers with all kinds of background, including PHP but also including stuff like Erlang, Java and C++. facebook uses a wide variety of platforms other than PHP to do a lot of the backend behind-the-scenes work
[08:09:43] <Falcon`> afaik they managed to actually write a tool that compiles PHP to, as they called it, "highly optimized C++ code"
[08:09:48] <tubbo`work> that's right
[08:09:53] <Falcon`> but
[08:09:57] <Falcon`> it's still php
[08:10:00] <Falcon`> (essentialy)
[08:10:00] <tubbo`work> well
[08:10:01] <tubbo`work> kinda
[08:10:26] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: they built a compiler that basically takes the interpreter step out of php. who knows what "php" means to them? there could be crazy extensions in there that aren't in the original language.
[08:10:59] <quickq> quick question... for a jquery plugin, i'm using the var methods = { method: function(){}; method2: function(){} } approach, how can i make method2 call itself using setTimeout()?
[08:11:08] <Falcon`> well, the fact is that .php appears very often in facebook's urls
[08:11:14] <Falcon`> that doesn't have to mean they use it
[08:11:15] <cusco> Im using a tooltip script based on jquery, 'aToolTip' or something, anyway it works just as needed but...
[08:11:17] <Falcon`> but, it's likely
[08:11:18] <cusco> I need to generate a number of html elements... each will be having a different tooltip, OnClick !!!, each will have a unique id
[08:11:21] <cusco> how do I call a jquery tooltip on each element ??
[08:11:36] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: but that's not what i'm talking about. i'm saying that from OUR perspective, facebook looks like it's "all php". but what i'm saying is that the frontend php app is making calls to other backend server applications that are written in more efficient languages like C++
[08:11:59] <Falcon`> hm
[08:12:04] <Falcon`> on some level all apps does that
[08:12:14] <Falcon`> php->call something (mostly MySQL), display result
[08:12:16] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: true, but in my job basically everything we do is ruby
[08:12:36] <Falcon`> oh well
[08:12:40] <Falcon`> good luck with ruby then
[08:12:57] <silverwind> Ruby is cool but nobody uses it
[08:13:01] <tubbo`work> agreed
[08:13:05] <silverwind> Not sure why...
[08:13:07] <tubbo`work> lol
[08:13:08] <Falcon`> though anyway, what i wanted to point out is that idea of taking all the objective part out of PHP is imo just wrong
[08:13:11] <cusco> :(
[08:13:31] <Falcon`> if you want to code site in procedural language then i believe that perl is what you're looking for
[08:13:38] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: ah, why do you say that? i really hate the OOP implementation
[08:13:44] <tubbo`work> nah not procedural, functional. big difference.
[08:13:48] <silverwind> lol
[08:13:55] <tubbo`work> C => procedural, Lisp => functional
[08:14:03] <tubbo`work> s/procedural/imperative
[08:14:03] <silverwind> Nobody knows to program in functional... it's just a rumor.
[08:14:04] <Falcon`> never even seen lisp tbh
[08:14:17] <Falcon`> and i like php as it is
[08:14:21] <silverwind> Falcon`, (lol 323 23)
[08:14:29] <silverwind> Falcon`, Now you've seen it :P
[08:14:30] <Falcon`> you can do these small projects very quickly
[08:14:39] <tubbo`work> silverwind: nobody uses ruby? https://github.com/languages
[08:14:45] <Falcon`> though it's very bad language for beginners
[08:14:57] <Falcon`> imo lack of strong typing gives too much freedom
[08:15:09] <silverwind> tubbo`work, those results are biased..
[08:15:25] <tubbo`work> silverwind: true, but it's an indicator. there are a lot of people using ruby.
[08:15:41] <silverwind> tubbo`work, That's like saying that nobody uses IE because nobody who goes to slashdot.org uses it
[08:15:45] <tubbo`work> haha
[08:15:52] <tubbo`work> it's just an exampel
[08:15:55] <tubbo`work> example*
[08:16:07] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: php doesn't have strong typing though?
[08:16:19] <quickq> quick question... for a jquery plugin, i'm using the var methods = { method: function(){}; method2: function(){} } approach, how can i make method2 call itself using setTimeout()?
[08:16:24] <silverwind> The tiobe index is already a better metric.. even if it's a bit bad http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html
[08:16:28] <Falcon`> yes, that's what i said
[08:16:49] <tubbo`work> oh yeah sorry i musnderstood
[08:16:50] <jaha> anyone used jquery to access the loggly API? I cant seem to get it to work
[08:16:50] <silverwind> quickq, $.proxy
[08:17:11] <quickq> silverwind, thak you
[08:17:15] <quickq> silverwind, thank you!
[08:17:34] <tubbo`work> silverwind: never knew about that, thanks for the link. ruby's still up there in terms of major languages used. it's of course a smaller minority because it's the newest of all those languages.
[08:17:42] <tubbo`work> in terms of mainstream adoption
[08:17:57] <silverwind> tubbo`work, well.. rails was the hype back in 2003..
[08:18:00] <Falcon`> oh wow, javascript first
[08:18:13] <silverwind> Falcon`, On github?
[08:18:16] <Falcon`> yea
[08:18:23] <Falcon`> i'm writing in javascript atm
[08:18:28] <Falcon`> and i already hate it
[08:18:34] <tubbo`work> silverwind: right but python got a lot of notoriety in the late 90s for shell scripting tasks, php got a lot of hype in the late 90s for web dev
[08:18:41] <tubbo`work> ruby's more of a late 2000s thing imo
[08:19:00] <tubbo`work> silverwind: rails *came out* 8 years ago. it was released 8 years ago.
[08:19:14] <tubbo`work> in 2003 php was still top dog
[08:19:16] <Falcon`> though ruby isn't really much faster than php, is it?
[08:19:18] <silverwind> tubbo`work, Sorry.. 2004 then
[08:19:24] <silverwind> Falcon`, a lot slower
[08:19:28] <Falcon`> o7
[08:19:28] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: "faster"?
[08:19:33] <tubbo`work> that's not a real metric
[08:19:36] <silverwind> Falcon`, Ruby is the slowest
[08:19:42] <Falcon`> well, depends on requirements
[08:19:47] <Falcon`> or "point of view"
[08:19:51] <tubbo`work> it really depends on EVERYTHING actually
[08:19:52] <Industrial> NodeJS needs a decent RAD framework a-la rails/django. Hundreds have popped up without a clear winner
[08:19:52] <silverwind> Javascript with V8 is a lot faster than PHP
[08:20:05] <Falcon`> lol
[08:20:06] <Industrial> (following DRY principles, not thow-all-your-own-modules-together)
[08:20:11] <tubbo`work> Industrial: it's hard because JS is such an expressive language.
[08:20:22] <Industrial> tubbo`work: I prefer CoffeeScript :)
[08:20:26] <silverwind> Falcon`, It shows that google spent a shitload of money on V8...
[08:20:33] <tubbo`work> Industrial: same thing
[08:20:36] <Falcon`> maybe, i don't give a damn
[08:20:46] <Falcon`> code must be crossbrowser anyway :|
[08:20:54] * warrenparsons still doesn't understand the appeal of Coffeescript.
[08:21:02] <silverwind> warrenparsons, elegance.
[08:21:06] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: in the web world, it doesn't matter.
[08:21:10] <tubbo`work> warrenparsons: easier to read, that's about it.
[08:21:19] <Falcon`> really?
[08:21:21] <Falcon`> how so?
[08:21:34] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: yeah, because most of the time it takes to serve a request comes from transferring the data from the server to client
[08:21:41] <Falcon`> you just display a nice window to your client "sorry, but only chrome is supported"?
[08:21:43] <warrenparsons> silverwind: Elegance in what sense? Certainly not in the 80% maintenance lifecycle of the code.
[08:22:02] <silverwind> warrenparsons, seems like you never seen coffeescript..
[08:22:05] <tubbo`work> Falcon`: no i meant it doesn't matter how "fast" your backend language is. it matters how efficient your server architecture is.
[08:22:21] <tubbo`work> warrenparsons: i'm not sure what you mean by an 80% maintenence lifecycle
[08:22:21] <Falcon`> it does matter
[08:22:28] <warrenparsons> silverwind: I have seen it. What I have not seen are any tangible benefits to learning a non-JS-based syntax for writing JS.
[08:22:42] <tubbo`work> warrenparsons: no, you should learn JS first. you will be fucked otherwise.
[08:22:43] <Falcon`> obviously, how optimized the code is, is much bigger factor
[08:22:45] <silverwind> Falcon`, most of the time, no.. because you're DB-bound or IO-bound.. pretty much never CPU-bound
[08:23:00] <Falcon`> but still, if you have a limited founds for the hosting, just everything matters
[08:23:04] <tubbo`work> coffeescript is for people who have been using JS for too long and are tired of all the fanciness. it's an abstraction. learn the base lang first, THEN the abstraction.
[08:23:07] <warrenparsons> tubbo`work: I'm referring to the fact that 80% of the work done on any bit of code is maintaining it rather than writing it.
[08:23:23] <EdwardIII> fears about debugging hell have kept me off coffeescript
[08:23:38] <Falcon`> silverwind: yea, because php loads all the shit to memory and caches it.... same for ruby i guess
[08:23:41] <warrenparsons> EdwardIII: That's a big part of it for me too.
[08:23:43] <tubbo`work> warrenparsons: oh right. CS errors have pretty informative backtraces though imo
[08:24:16] <tubbo`work> EdwardIII: it's a bit more cumbersome because you can't just "see" the code in the debugger, but JS debugging sucks anyway, it's not much different
[08:24:31] <warrenparsons> Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying CS is crap. I'm saying I have not seen any compelling arguments for using it.
[08:24:36] <silverwind> Falcon`, Just saying that even if you did the backend in C.... most of the time, in most applications, it wouldn't matter as you'd still be waiting for the damn database
[08:24:57] <tubbo`work> warrenparsons: there aren't, unless you use ruby on rails or something else that manages your assets and compiles them on the fly
[08:25:06] <tubbo`work> OR you want to build backend javascript applications
[08:25:21] <tubbo`work> pow.cx is a good example of a widely-used app written in coffeescript
[08:25:34] <tubbo`work> but the big plus there is you're running on a single v8 implementation. much less margin of error.
[08:25:57] <Falcon`> the damn database uses damn CPU to proccess my request
[08:26:05] <Falcon`> so the less CPU I take, the faster it'll be
[08:26:18] <Ricaz> Is it bad practice to use HTML5 these days? I have a client who says the website looks weird and all wrong, and I'm suspecting either <IE8 or that she has disabled JS. Could it be my markup that's horrible? www.klinik-m.dk
[08:26:40] <Altreus> I'm getting "Illegal invocation" from $.ajax -- http://paste.debian.net/177973/ line 11
[08:26:40] <warrenparsons> Ricaz: NOT using HTML5 is bad practice.
[08:26:41] <Falcon`> and somehow i'd rather write in another language than write my own db
[08:26:50] <Altreus> But it seems perfectly fine to me
[08:27:00] <Altreus> anyone see a problem?
[08:27:26] <warrenparsons> Ricaz: But you have to include polyfills to support IE8 and below unless they're not part of your audience.
[08:27:35] <tubbo`work> Ricaz: don't suspect, know. what browser is she using? has she disabled javascript?
[08:27:55] <tubbo`work> don't waste your time and chase wild geese, KNOW the problem before you start fixing it.
[08:27:56] <Ricaz> She claims everyone she knows is using IE
[08:28:01] <tubbo`work> what version?
[08:28:02] <EdwardIII> tubbo`work: that's kinda what stops me from really getting into node.js too
[08:28:16] <Ricaz> No idea.. She's not really tech savvy in any way
[08:28:25] <Altreus> EdwardIII: I see you there pretending you're not
[08:28:25] <tubbo`work> EdwardIII: what, coffeescript? you don't *need* to use it..
[08:28:27] <Ricaz> I tested it in IE8 and IE9, worked both places
[08:28:33] <ajpiano> Ricaz: using the HTML5 doctype helps
[08:28:40] <EdwardIII> tubbo`work: no, node.js - seperately
[08:28:42] <tubbo`work> Ricaz: instruct her how to find out
[08:28:42] <EdwardIII> Altreus: you absolute legend
[08:28:50] <warrenparsons> LOL
[08:28:54] <Ricaz> Can anyone test to see if it looks horrible in IE? :P
[08:28:54] <tubbo`work> EdwardIII: what's been stopping you then?
[08:28:55] <Altreus> EdwardIII: legend but not a myth
[08:29:03] <warrenparsons> Yeah, the doctype is pretty critical to using HTML5.
[08:29:04] <Altreus> EdwardIII: actually a mythter
[08:29:06] <ajpiano> Ricaz: are you using the html5shim in IE ?
[08:29:09] <EdwardIII> tubbo`work: fears about debugging
[08:29:13] <EdwardIII> Altreus: fibber
[08:29:13] <tubbo`work> Ricaz: oh yeah you definitely need just <!DOCTYPE html>
[08:29:17] <Altreus> u
[08:29:19] <tubbo`work> don't fuck with the rest of that line
[08:29:27] <tubbo`work> EdwardIII: node.js is very easy to debug
[08:29:29] <Ricaz> ajpiano html5shim?
[08:29:33] <ajpiano> yes
[08:29:47] <ajpiano> HTML5 elements aren't stylable in oldIE unless you use the html5 shim
[08:29:49] <tubbo`work> ajpiano: he's using modernizr...does he need the shim too?
[08:29:55] <ajpiano> oh, then no
[08:30:02] <tubbo`work> <script src="res/js/modernizr-2.5.3.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[08:30:09] <Ricaz> i use mordernizr
[08:30:09] <ajpiano> he should be includnig modernizr before jquery though
[08:30:15] <tubbo`work> ahh that might do it!
[08:30:18] <Ricaz> really?
[08:30:24] <tubbo`work> Ricaz: on early versions of IE javascript gets fucked when there's an error
[08:30:25] <warrenparsons> tubbo`work: The type attribute is invalid in HTML5.
[08:30:27] <ajpiano> Ricaz: yes, you want that shim to run as early as possible
[08:30:34] <tubbo`work> like on IE 7 JS just won't execute when there's an error.
[08:30:35] <Ricaz> done
[08:30:36] <ajpiano> and then the rest of your scripts should be loaded at the bottom of the body
[08:30:41] <tubbo`work> yeah give that a shot
[08:30:44] <tubbo`work> might fix it
[08:30:58] <Ricaz> I don't see any JS errors
[08:31:07] <Ricaz> if only IEs dev tools were more competent..
[08:31:28] <Ricaz> She might have disabled JS entirely, but even when disabling it, it looks fine here
[08:31:33] <Ricaz> I have no idea what's wrong.
[08:31:57] <tubbo`work> Ricaz: what's wrong is you're guessing. ask her the version of IE. talk on the phone if you must, and instruct her how to find it.
[08:32:08] <Ricaz> tubbo`work will do that
[08:32:57] <warrenparsons> Good advice. We too frequently get emails from clients about problems they're experiencing with next to no detail. It usually takes 3 or 4 emails or a call to suss out the exact situation.
[08:34:29] <quickq> if someone's got a chance, could someone please take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/N7PJy/32/, the issue is a function won't call itself using settimeout
[08:35:08] <Altreus> alright I'm a noob and the correct answer was to remember to call .val() on your input selectors
[08:37:28] <EdwardIII> Altreus: beer soon?
[08:37:45] <EdwardIII> Altreus: noob to jQuery?
[08:38:07] <ajpiano> quickq: you aren't passing a duration in the first timeout
[08:38:55] <pifantastic> quickq: http://jsfiddle.net/N7PJy/33/
[08:39:20] <pifantastic> quickq: self.methods['run'] doesn't make sense because self *is* methods
[08:39:28] <quickq> ^OH
[08:39:42] <quickq> pifantastic, how do you know that? (or find out)
[08:40:09] <pifantastic> quickq: there was a console error. Are you using Firebug or Chrome Dev Tools?
[08:41:27] <quickq> pifantastic, chrome's (F12) gave me undefined does not contain 'run'
[08:41:41] <quickq> pifantastic, doesn't tell me much about the self object :S
[08:42:40] <boulet101010> hi, i'm trying to check a checkbox, but it's uncheckable. what are the attributes that could avoid me to check them (i know disabled, enabled...)
[08:44:04] <kamo> Do you have a jsfiddle on the issue
[08:44:40] <kamo> @boulet Do have an example where we can see what is going on?
[08:44:53] <pifantastic> ?ftj @ quickq
[08:44:53] <bot-t> quickq, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[08:45:07] <boulet101010> hard to reproduce...
[08:45:11] <pifantastic> quickq: there is a whole world of awesome debugging you can do with Chrome: http://grimhappy.com/i/c94cdc2.png
[08:45:19] <boulet101010> it's a form in a lightbox
[08:45:40] <boulet101010> everything works, even the text editor (ckeditor), the only issue is the checkbox.
[08:46:23] <boulet101010> when i generate the form out of the website, no problem
[08:46:24] <pifantastic> quickq: in any case, I was wrong. In the case of the "run" method, you're setting `this` equal to the jQuery object
[08:46:48] <pifantastic> quickq: therefore self actually refers to $("#wtf")
[08:46:56] <kamo> Any overriding CSS properties?  That you may not know about?
[08:47:04] <quickq> wow thanks pifantastic
[08:47:24] <Zelgod> Anyone have experince with the ".on("load"..." event. I can't seem to get it to fire.
[08:48:29] <boulet101010> http://jsfiddle.net/Ew4zD/1/ this is the form
[08:48:30] <quickq> pifantastic, i will investigate what the this is, thanks for that tip
[08:48:39] <pifantastic> np
[08:48:42] <boulet101010> yes maybe an overriding css, or maybe dom property...
[08:49:50] <kamo> Yeah that would be my first guess at it
[08:50:04] <quickq> pifantastic, yep you're correct, i want to thank you very much
[08:50:06] <kamo> I am looking into the jsfiddle now
[08:50:23] <pifantastic> quickq: you're welcome!
[08:50:24] <boulet101010> >>> $('#lightbox').find('[name="visible"]').attr('checked');
[08:50:25] <boulet101010> "checked"
[08:50:27] <boulet101010> >>> $('#lightbox').find('[name="visible"]').attr('checked','');
[08:50:29] <boulet101010> [input]
[08:50:30] <boulet101010> this is FB answer.
[08:50:43] <boulet101010> and it doesn't switch...
[08:51:45] <innociv__> http://unity3d.com/?mecanim What do you all this kind of layout? Is there a plugin that makes it easy?
[08:53:24] <kamo> That would work in some cases but not all
[08:57:37] <kamo> @boulet is there anyway to assign an id to the checkbox
[08:58:11] <boulet101010> yes of course
[08:58:11] <kamo> @boulet the name is a css keyword aswell so that might be an issue
[08:58:44] <Altreus> EdwardIII: yeah beer at half 5 ish
[08:58:58] <EdwardIII> Altreus: you win, my dad is here
[08:59:00] <kamo> @boulet http://jsfiddle.net/Ew4zD/3/
[08:59:05] <Altreus> lolfao;
[08:59:07] <Altreus> er fail
[09:00:14] <kamo> @boulet did you see the change?
[09:01:13] <boulet101010> yes of course but i need to go away
[09:01:19] <Zelgod> .on work for future elements?
[09:01:19] <boulet101010> good evening!
[09:01:31] <kamo> Good Evening I hope it helped
[09:02:41] <Zelgod> ive been told .on is supposed to replace .live but .on doesnt seem to be wokring for me.
[09:03:14] <NoiseEee> Zelgod: you would need to adjust your code slightly. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[09:03:19] <Posterdati> please I need help to make galleriffic works in a jquery dialog
[09:07:58] <lookMaImOnIrc> hi
[09:09:16] <innociv__> http://unity3d.com/?mecanim What do you all this kind of layout? Is there a plugin that makes it easy?  Where things slide up or to the side based off scroll position.
[09:09:52] <lookMaImOnIrc> i'd love to know if this sounds familiar to anyone: after calling .addClass()/.removeClass() in IE8, the affected element will only be repainted after the next click event on any element (jQuery 1.2.6 - i know it's old, but i'm stuck with it)
[09:15:16] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: apparently "load" will not bubble up in all browsers using .on , "but can be used when the event handler is directly attached to the element generating the event" - any idea how to do this?
[09:20:25] <NoiseEee> Zelgod: well what element are you hoping the load event will fire on?
[09:22:28] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: load event needs to fire on a div.
[09:23:03] <NoiseEee> Zelgod: not the way it works.  <div> does not fire a load event.
[09:23:14] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: Explain?
[09:23:43] <NoiseEee> Zelgod: load events are fired on <img>, <script>, and document
[09:23:48] <NoiseEee> not sure if any others, but certainly not markup elements.
[09:24:09] <NoiseEee> Zelgod: what is being loaded into that div?  how is it being "loaded" or updated?
[09:25:45] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: I have a div i am adding to the DOM. After the div load its needs to make a child element into a button. This needs to occur for all future divs of that class.
[09:26:23] <NoiseEee> whatever function adds it to the dom should then make the child element into the button.
[09:26:52] <NoiseEee> etcDiv.append(newDiv);  makeIntoButton(newDiv.find('.something'))    as a loose example
[09:27:16] <NoiseEee> Zelgod: if you don't have control over the new content being added, you cannot make the button happen automatically without polling the DOM for changes.
[09:27:48] <Zelgod> and how do i go about polling the dom in that case?
[09:28:27] <Zelgod> i'm used to using .live for this.
[09:28:38] <BoulderDave> when I use the animate() to toggle the height of an element, or slideToggle(), the event is called an extra time for every time that I have reloaded that element using .load() function via an ajax call.  any ideas?  So for example, if i use ajax to reload the entire floating cart, and then call toggle(), it toggles twice.  if i do it again, it toggles 3 times.  The elements are not being duplicated though.
[09:28:44] <NoiseEee> there's no way it worked with .live and not with .on, Zelgod
[09:29:02] <NoiseEee> are you controlling the code that adds the new div?
[09:29:29] <BoulderDave> NoiseEee, talking to me?
[09:29:35] <NoiseEee> no to Zelgod sorry
[09:29:39] <quickq> hi all quick question, if I use jquery.data() inside a plugin, will this conflict with other plugins if others use the same key?
[09:29:40] <BoulderDave> NoiseEee, no worries :)
[09:29:45] <Zelgod> <NoiseEee>: no
[09:29:48] <Zelgod> oops
[09:29:57] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: No ;)
[09:29:57] <lotus> hey http://jsfiddle.net/NYMqa/  I'm trying to get jquery ui tabs to work and not succeeding.  Any help is appreciated
[09:30:02] <NoiseEee> Zelgod: and you're telling me a <div> fired a load event with .live?
[09:32:01] <quickq> hi all quick question, if I use jquery.data() inside a plugin, will this conflict with other plugins if others use the same key?
[09:32:05] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: perhaps not the "load" event.
[09:32:15] <bnb_dev> Hello ALL!
[09:32:17] <javalover> hi
[09:32:29] <lotus> hello~
[09:32:37] <javalover> if I call window.onpopstate  numerous times does it add multiple functions or replace the existing one?
[09:32:44] <bnb_dev> i used bind function to prevent form submission on enter key
[09:32:54] <bnb_dev> but i have a problem with textarea
[09:32:59] <NoiseEee> so Zelgod your only solution would either be polling the DOM element you expect to see new changes in (ie: set timeout, count how many of the divs are there, if changed from last count, fire your thing)  or you can use a hack like http://davidwalsh.name/detect-node-insertion / http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/dom/as/complete/
[09:33:08] <bnb_dev> The enter key not work for textarea
[09:33:14] <bnb_dev> how i solve this?
[09:33:27] <NoiseEee> bnb_dev: uh, disable the submit even of the form, don't bind any key events!
[09:33:38] <NoiseEee> s/even/event
[09:33:42] <lotus> bnb_dev: you can check for the keycode
[09:34:02] <NoiseEee> checking keys events for preventing form submission on 'enter' is silly end expensive
[09:34:06] <NoiseEee> s/end/and/
[09:34:59] <bnb_dev> how i check  which key is pressed inside the $('#form').submit ()?
[09:35:02] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: $("div").on("load","button",eventHandler); this is what i'm trying to accomiplish
[09:35:22] <lotus> bnb_dev: bnb_dev you can also use "return functionname()" in the onSubmit section of the form and then have the function return true to submit the form or false to not submit the form
[09:35:24] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: this is what i know.. $("div button").live("click",eventHandler);
[09:35:53] <NoiseEee> Zelgod: you're not going to accomplish it man.  <div>s do NOT FIRE a load event.
[09:36:36] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: I understand that. However $("div").on("click","button",eventHandler); doesnt take care of future items added to the dom.
[09:36:51] <NoiseEee> $('#commonParentToAllDynamicContent').on('click','div button',eventHandler);  is your equivalent
[09:37:15] <lotus> ahh, solved my problem.  I was running .tabs on the wrong element.
[09:39:30] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: would that bind the event handler to futurers items?
[09:39:52] <Zelgod> future*
[09:40:04] <NoiseEee> Zelgod: yes
[09:40:39] <NoiseEee> event delegation: the common parent receives all the clicks; if the element matches your selector ('div button'), the eventHandler fires.
[09:43:33] <myrman> Hello. I'm trying to load a json api but it keeps returning that there's an "Unexpected token  :" in chrome, and firefox has a similar error. http://jsfiddle.net/dWtet/1/
[09:43:37] <myrman> Any help is appreciated
[09:45:29] <NoiseEee> myrman: certainly http://api.punchfork.com/recipes?key=164d740d600e7869&q=vegetarian&callback=? returns valid JSON so your issue is not in what you pasted.
[09:46:12] <Zelgod> NoiseEee: Do you have an example of an event occuring when it gets added to the dom and you don't have control? You help has been great but all of this occurs on click. I need the event to occur once its added.
[09:46:27] <dabear_> myrman: the issue is that punchfork returns json, and not jsonp, like you requested. e.g. the callback parameter isn't working
[09:46:40] <NoiseEee> Zelgod: the only way would be to poll with a timeout, or use a hack like the links i pasted above that use requestAnimationFrame
[09:47:10] <myrman> dabear_: should I specify json in the parameters?
[09:48:04] <dabear_> myrman: that site is an external site. jquery does not support json against external sites; you must use jsonp. However, that site does not support jsonp
[09:48:33] <dabear_> (technically json over remote domains is possible though, but not as easy)
[09:48:46] <myrman> dabear_: so what you are saying is that I can't load that api through jquery?
[09:48:57] <bnb_dev> NoiseEee: how can i check keyCode inside $('#form').submit() ?
[09:49:44] <Connorhd> myrman: http://api.punchfork.com/recipes?key=164d740d600e7869&q=vegetarian&jsonp=? looks like it works
[09:50:37] <myrman> Oh lovely!
[09:51:29] <Back2Basics> on google maps if you click on one of the markers is that box that pop's up called a "callout"?
[09:52:05] <myrman> Thank you to NoiseEee, dabear_ and Connorhd. You've all been very helpful.
[09:52:31] <NoiseEee> bnb_dev: you don't.  you disable the submit event on the form, period, and you use your submit button to explicitly submit the form via JS
[09:52:47] <innociv__> http://unity3d.com/?mecanim What do you all this kind of layout? Is there a plugin that makes it easy?  Where things slide up or to the side based off scroll position.
[09:54:18] <bnb_dev> OK
[09:54:29] <bnb_dev> NoiseEee: thanks
[09:56:43] <ryanneufeld> hola
[09:59:53] <catcher> bonjour
[10:00:10] <inspiron> i'm using a getJSON and trying to pass values into a method that will be useable when the getJSON is executed. I'm having trouble passing the values into the return $.proxy()  section. it passes in the mouse event instead of the values i tell it to: http://jsfiddle.net/YZgzS/1/
[10:09:57] <zyltoid> does unbind remove delegated events (via on)?
[10:10:31] <skisulli> no, you will want to use .off with the same selectors as you .on calls
[10:10:51] <zyltoid> is there a way to remove all events associated with an element?
[10:11:01] <zyltoid> without specifying each
[10:11:05] <zyltoid> selector, i mean
[10:11:56] <NoiseEee> zyltoid: http://api.jquery.com/off/
[10:13:14] <EvilCrayon> Hey peeps, what would you recommend as one of the best tutorial like ways to learn jquery? Besides the wicked awesome reference as jquery.com I mean.
[10:13:49] <jiu> anyone could help with jqdrid plugin ?
[10:14:03] <bencahill> Hey guys, I've got li's with data-rating="(0-5)" (0-5) = 0 through 5...If given, e.g. 2, can I find all the li's that have a data-rating of 2 or more without needing a loop?
[10:14:22] <bencahill> Ooh, maybe a jQuery function with a function that tests...
[10:14:51] <bencahill> Ooh, probably .filter()
[10:15:12] <bencahill> Yeah, awesome.
[10:15:14] <skisulli> benchill: $('[data-rating=2]') should work
[10:15:24] <bencahill> skisulli: I want 2 to pull up 2,3,4,5
[10:15:26] <skisulli> benchill: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[10:15:42] <bencahill> 0 to pull up 0-5...etc
[10:15:44] <skisulli> so 2 or greater
[10:15:48] <bencahill> Yup.
[10:15:55] <jiu> any link of asociation panels in jquery ?.. i mean two lists width drag and drop capabilities
[10:16:22] <zyltoid> NoiseEee: thanks, i see that it removes all if no selector is given
[10:17:04] <skisulli> benchill: you might be able to build a != attr selector http://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/
[10:17:19] <bencahill> skisulli: I'm filtering an existing jQuery object, so I'd assume var.filter( function() { return $(this).attr('data-rating') >= 2; }); Something like that?
[10:17:30] <bencahill> skisulli: Ooh, that's interesting.
[10:17:53] <skisulli> bencahill: filter would probably work well too
[10:18:32] <bencahill> Yeah, I think I'll do that.
[10:19:09] <zyltoid> how does jquery handle optional parameter positions?
[10:19:21] <skisulli> the filter is still going to be a loop, but if you already did the selection, then its probably faster than a complex selector
[10:20:36] <skisulli> zyltoid: it depends, some functions have different behavior depending on how many/what type of params are passed, some use options objects
[10:21:15] <skisulli> zyltoid: see http://api.jquery.com/on/ vs. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:23:23] <zyltoid> skisulli: i understand the object way. in the case of positional, i'm guessing jquery checks the count?
[10:23:39] <zyltoid> and probably types too
[10:23:42] <ryanneufeld> ?js encodeURIComponent(document.referrer);
[10:23:46] <bot-t> ryanneufeld: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[10:23:48] <skisulli> yeah, checks count and types
[10:24:20] <zyltoid> skisulli: great, ty :)
[10:25:06] <skisulli> zyltold: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L867
[10:25:29] <quickq> hi all quick question, if I use jquery.data() inside a plugin, will this conflict with other plugins if others use the same key?
[10:25:41] <shoky> quickq: yes
[10:26:06] <quickq> shoky, any idea on how to most efficiently avoid collisions with other plugins when storing data?
[10:26:12] <skisulli> quickq: your plugin should namespece all keys you set with data
[10:26:14] <zyltoid> skisulli: nice, thanks !
[10:26:31] <quickq> skisulli do you bychance have an example of namespace + .data?
[10:27:03] <skisulli> quickq: so something like $.data('pluginNameKey', value)
[10:27:47] <quickq> gotcha thanks, and then I presume everything would be stored within the value (array)
[10:27:51] <quickq> much aprpeciated
[10:27:57] <skisulli> or if you are setting a lot you can do $.data('pluginName', { key: value, key2: value2 });
[10:28:53] <skisulli> yeah basically the key that you pass to the data call should have your plugin name in it so that it is less likely to conflict
[10:32:56] <Salt> unsure if this is a question for here or #jquerymobile, but I'm looking to get a particular plug-in and the files seem to be missing. perhaps there is a better way to detect swipe events but jFlick seems to be what I am looking for, any suggestions how to do this/find the file?
[11:03:41] <ravenzz> given an array of domains how can I find all the links to these domains? var domains = ['foo.com', 'bar.com', 'b.ar']; elem.find('a[data-test="domains"');
[11:04:08] <ravenzz> should I loop the domains array?
[11:05:03] <ngharo> yes
[11:05:19] <Carlitta87> hey, i have an error with date picker....wont initialize my generated input
[11:05:19] <Carlitta87> http://demo.devmediastudios.com/ccuinvestment/nmcms.php?snippet=forms&p=individual_application&info=23
[11:06:11] <ravenzz> ngharo and if elem.find( currentDomain ).length > 0 store it on collectionWhatever ?
[11:06:52] <ngharo> yep
[11:07:30] <ravenzz> roger that
[11:07:31] <ravenzz> ty
[11:12:25] <Carlitta87> how can i refresh date picker each time sum one clicks a buttons without ajax?
[11:12:41] <Carlitta87> my date picker won't come up for my generated input
[11:13:25] <silverwind> Carlitta87, You use the second form of .on
[11:13:45] <silverwind> $(document).on('click', yourSelectorHere, function(e) {})
[11:14:12] <Rinthe> how can i show some html without appending it to the document?
[11:14:35] <silverwind> The same way you can drink water without drinking it
[11:14:39] <dd5> hi guys. I have weird problem with jqueryvectormap (http://jvectormap.com/). Site shifts left/right in ie7 and ie8 when hovering over it. Anyone experienced same issue?
[11:17:17] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/y2VheM8u The #infinite-loading div shows up, but it doesn't hide when more content shows up, any ideas?
[11:20:40] <Carlitta87> silverwind : just tried it...doesnt seem to be working tho
[11:23:08] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/3mkxmTCJ is the success: function(html){} the same as a callback function?
[11:25:02] <StephenS> hello
[11:28:05] <someprimetime> so I'm using remy sharp's drag drop example on jsbin, but I'm switching it to jsfiddle and addEvent() is coming up as undefined. I know I should be using addEventListener() but that doesn't work with the demo: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/N9TZX/1/
[11:28:14] <someprimetime> original demo is on http://jsbin.com/ijeza/510/edit#source
[11:28:39] <someprimetime> so I guess I'm asking why is addEvent() accepted on jsbin and not on jsfiddle?
[11:35:13] <barry_> hey
[11:35:24] <Stephen> Hey!
[11:35:32] <someprimetime> HEY
[11:35:35] <barry_> finally! a person
[11:35:41] <ryzngard> is there a way to have jquery ui tabs always on top?
[11:35:41] <ryanneufeld> someprimetime: perhaps its that you have the <script src="http://html5demos.com/h5utils.js"></script> on jsbin
[11:35:48] <ryanneufeld> someprimetime: but not on jsfiddle
[11:35:48] <barry_> joining channels all over the place and no one about
[11:35:55] <someprimetime> ryanneufeld: ah wow i totally missed that
[11:35:58] <someprimetime> +1
[11:35:58] <someprimetime> thanks
[11:36:07] <someprimetime> ryzngard: what do you mean always on top?
[11:36:09] <someprimetime> like a z-index?
[11:36:27] <ryanneufeld> someprimetime: np
[11:36:30] <ryzngard> someprimetime: um, always visible even on scroll. So they always stay at the top of the screen
[11:36:49] <someprimetime> ryzngard: got an example? i think you maybe want a position: fixed; on the parent container?
[11:36:50] <ryanneufeld> ryzngard: position:fixed ?
[11:36:51] <barry_> position:fixed
[11:36:54] <Stephen> ryzngard: I believe that is display: fixed
[11:36:58] <Stephen> er, position
[11:37:00] <Stephen> right
[11:37:21] <ryanneufeld> you have to set a top/bottom and right/left
[11:37:37] <ryzngard> wouldn't that cause the internal divs to also be fixed?
[11:37:55] <ryzngard> the divs for the content of each tab, that is
[11:37:57] <StephenS> Hey, I have form and a submit button, when I press it, how can I make it, so the text appear next to the page without reload, but to pull out that info from the db, cause when I press submit, info will be injected to the db, and then needed to pull out with jquery.
[11:38:13] <barry_> and z-index, also helps to have element lower down on page - to help any issues with whats on top
[11:38:15] <ryanneufeld> ?ajax @ StephenS
[11:38:16] <bot-t> StephenS, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:38:21] <Stephen> ryzngard: Then wrap the fixed div around another absolutely positioned div
[11:38:30] <StephenS> Stephen u stole my name :)
[11:38:33] <Stephen> Or a relatively positioned one
[11:38:43] <Stephen> lol
[11:39:03] <StephenS> ?
[11:39:12] <Stephen> I worked hard at having an ircOp release this name due to their own terms of service years ago. :-)
[11:39:28] <Stephen> It was hard work, but totally worth it.
[11:39:35] <StephenS> I wanna buy your name
[11:39:39] <StephenS> for 100$?
[11:39:46] <LessSeen> :o
[11:39:59] * Stephen thinks
[11:40:02] <barry_> I'm stephen and so is my wife
[11:40:11] <Stephen> My wife is barry.
[11:40:19] <barry_> :)
[11:40:37] <barry_> any long time programmers here?
[11:40:44] <Stephen> \o
[11:40:56] <skisulli> depends on what you consider long time
[11:41:04] <barry_> 10+ years
[11:41:09] <someprimetime> i've been on the internet for a long time
[11:41:19] <barry_> am at 14 now - and time has gone by so quick :(
[11:41:25] <Stephen> 13 years business, 20 or more total
[11:41:31] <someprimetime> since '95ish
[11:41:44] <someprimetime> but only programming for a few years
[11:41:58] <skisulli> ah, I've been programming for almost 10 if you count my years in college. only doing it 8 professionally
[11:42:01] <barry_> dad got be the first 386, but didn't get into programming for a while - was a lot of karateka :)
[11:42:20] <Back2Basics> if I have 2 models.ForeignKey.to_field's on line 7 and 8 http://dpaste.org/oY3CO/  am I sure they are pointing to the same instance?
[11:42:49] <someprimetime> maybe try #python or #django
[11:42:58] <Back2Basics> oops
[11:43:18] <StephenS> Stephen so wanna?
[11:43:44] <barry_> $100 is not an offer u get every day for a name :)
[11:44:41] <Stephen> Umm... hmm
[11:44:48] <Stephen> You're being serious?
[11:44:54] <StephenS> yes

[11:46:43] <barry_> shit my typing is bad right nwo
[11:46:45] <barry_>  
[11:46:47] <barry_> now
[11:47:13] <barry_> stephen: make $100 - don't pass it up dude
[11:48:16] <barry_> I'm coding a thing that generates videos like animoto atm
[11:48:43] <barry_> just non stop coding coding out of my mind - need ppl to talk to :)
[11:49:25] <barry_> shit this is lame, heaps of ppl join, nothing to say - board
[11:49:55] <mikkelb> jedimind: about last night - is this what you meant? http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ECB9W/4/
[11:51:06] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ECB9W/4/ - I'm trying to do this JS dropdown menu which falls back on CSS if the user doesn't have JS enabled. The JS should also offer a slight delay on the hide incase the user accidentally moves outside of the hit area. Am I doing it right though?
[11:51:16] <barry_> mikkelb: move the drop down up a bit so it doesn't disappear when i move mouse down e.g.   css       {top:-5)
[11:51:26] <barry_> {top:-5px}
[11:51:36] <mikkelb> barry_: great idea thanks :-)
[11:52:42] <barry_> should need a delay with that but if u want delay just use setinterval  e.g. http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-setinterval-function
[11:53:32] <barry_> that will delay before a function is triggered - and un there u can do the hide - i like to also cancel the set interval if its called again (i.e. hide function called again with mouse out)
[11:53:54] <jedimind> mikkelb, yeah but you dont even need that class="dropdown" on it any more
[11:54:09] <jedimind> i mean it doesnt matter if whatever css/js triggers on the LIs that dont have a dropdown, they just wont have a UL inside it to show it
[11:54:10] <jedimind> thats lal
[11:54:24] <jedimind> anyway that js will need some work
[11:54:34] <jedimind> im a little busy writing blog posts today though to try to put any brainpower towards it
[11:55:02] <mikkelb> jedimind: cool
[11:55:17] <mikkelb> i added the dropdown class though for that little arrow image there
[11:55:46] <StephenS> Stephen denied offer, too bad.
[11:55:59] <mikkelb> couldnt think of a better way
[11:56:02] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/3mkxmTCJ is the success: function(html){} the same as a callback function?
[11:56:08] <mikkelb> barry_: thanks for the input !
[11:56:44] <barry_> callback is just a var name=function(){} that can me called anywhere
[11:56:50] <barry_> via 'name'
[12:01:32] <SysSU> How would you use the jQuery selector to get the XX class. For example if I have 3 divs with the class "hello" how would I tell jQuery to select the 3rd div with the class "hello"?
[12:02:42] <Stephen> You typically would use [2], not a selector
[12:02:56] <barry_> eq
[12:03:07] <barry_> $('.hello).eq(2)
[12:03:13] <SysSU> sweet thanks!
[12:03:16] <Stephen> Ah, there we are
[12:03:23] <barry_> 2, being 3 because it starts at 0
[12:03:32] <SysSU> yep got it, thank you everyone
[12:04:17] <mikkelb> barry_: are there any alternatives to that top: -5px? the dropdown has to be where it's currently at - http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ECB9W/5/
[12:04:29] <SysSU> ok next question if you did that and you wanted to select another div inside that div how would you do that?
[12:05:00] <Stephen> $("div",$('.hello).eq(2))
[12:05:05] <SysSU> for example if you had <div class="hello"><div class="hi"></div></div>
[12:05:22] <barry_> top:-Xpx just bring it up a bit so it doesn't disappear and u move mouse down, otherwise use set interval to wait for a second or two before you hide
[12:05:36] <Stephen> $('div.hi",$('.hello).eq(2))
[12:05:49] <SysSU> wow
[12:05:52] <SysSU> let me try that haha
[12:05:54] <barry_> $('.hello').eq(2).find('.classname');
[12:06:32] <Stephen> or $('.hello).eq(2).closest("div.hi")
[12:06:55] <SysSU> what one is more correct?
[12:07:02] <Eviltwin> $("selector", $collection) is slower than $collection.find("selector") BTW
[12:07:06] <barry_> closest also works - but can select elements outside of what you have selected - where find selects specifically inside
[12:07:57] <barry_> i could be wrong actually, i usually use closest to select closest parents - not guaranteed if it select children too
[12:08:48] <Stephen> All depends on your situation I suppose, but yeah
[12:09:06] <Stephen> SysSU: .closest is the least correct
[12:09:22] <Stephen> .find() or the wrapping version are more correct
[12:09:40] <soee> hi, how can i select list element with some index ?
[12:09:43] <barry_> i typically use find for children and closest for parents
[12:09:55] <Stephen> chaining is preferred to wrapping like that, so .find() is the book answer
[12:10:04] <barry_> index number use $(eleemt).eq().
[12:10:11] <Stephen> lol
[12:10:20] <barry_> e.g. $(element).eq(0) for first
[12:10:27] <Stephen> and eq() wins again folks
[12:10:37] <mikkelb> barry_: so theres no way the current dropdown menu can work with pure CSS?
[12:10:42] <mikkelb> sorry for going offtopic
[12:10:44] <Eviltwin> People need denotations for their expertise in here
[12:11:25] <Stephen> mikkelb: You need a pure CSS dropdown?
[12:11:41] <barry_> many ways to do one thing and testing with huge loops is only way to check what performs better but i usually don't have time to do this :)
[12:11:56] <Stephen> May I ask why? As a form element css dropdowns stink. But as a menu they work great.
[12:12:03] <barry_> pure css as long is u can guarantee users are on later browsers
[12:12:44] <Stephen> And if you can't, fall back on link lists
[12:12:47] <mikkelb> Stephen: ive been told i need something to fall back on incase the user doesnt have js
[12:12:56] <Stephen> lol
[12:12:57] <barry_> i use purse css if I'm selling software and tell ppl you need to use chrome X+ and firefox X+
[12:13:16] <Stephen> If they don't have js, they likely won't have much css either, unless they are turning off js on purpose
[12:13:29] <mikkelb> true that
[12:13:32] <barry_> if its a solution for the general public u will need to consider falling back to i.e 6 or more
[12:14:08] <Stephen> Might I suggest something like modernizr as your baseline
[12:14:35] <Stephen> Oh, and IE6 can be dropped these days
[12:14:57] <barry_> not used modernisr but its designed specifically for this issue
[12:16:57] <mikkelb> nice!
[12:17:48] <jeffreylevesque> is there any nice overlay libraries that people know of?
[12:18:20] <barry_> overlay? as in div auto overlay a visible element on the page?
[12:18:43] <jeffreylevesque> you click a link
[12:18:49] <jeffreylevesque> then the screen has an overlay
[12:19:01] <jeffreylevesque> like http://www.bu.edu/tech/desktop/
[12:19:06] <jeffreylevesque> if you click 'Help'
[12:19:18] <jeffreylevesque> at the left, or 'Get Help' on the top right
[12:19:20] <LinzardMac> Hello guys. I am looking for some help with trying to animate the height of a box based on which div I am scrolled to (using a smooth scrolling anchor link).. I am pretty stuck and while I am advanced with php, css, and html - I am not very great with javascript just yet.
[12:19:20] <barry_> $(targetElement).css($(sourceElement.position()) - quick type should work
[12:19:51] <microhaxo> Why isn't this ajax call working in IE9??? It always fails but in firefox or chrome it works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/HqGD8/
[12:19:56] <devOlsen> umm should't be assignting that position to a property, like width or height, or top / left?
[12:20:01] <barry_> i mean $(targetElement).css($(sourceElement).position()) 
[12:21:00] <SysSU> Can someone point out to me why this var is coming up as "null"? var html = $('.message').eq(mCount).html();
[12:21:09] <LinzardMac> Here is my html structure: https://gist.github.com/3062243
[12:21:12] <SysSU> mCount = 5 when it gets to that point
[12:21:15] <barry_> microhaxo: perhaps cross domain restrictions
[12:21:30] <LinzardMac> and visualization of what I would LIKE to happen http://cl.ly/1H141w0e3F2E050r2n1r http://cl.ly/46421T2O1s3e2m3y2X2T
[12:21:32] <SysSU> and there is a 5th message
[12:21:32] <microhaxo> barry_ how can i fix?
[12:21:43] <barry_> browser block ajax from calling urls outside the domain it is currently on
[12:21:52] <barry_> for this you wil need jsonp
[12:21:59] <microhaxo> datatype jsonp?
[12:22:03] <barry_> yes
[12:22:08] <microhaxo> I tried that
[12:22:10] <microhaxo> still fails.
[12:22:15] <SysSU> oh wait i figured it out, there is 5 messages but the 5th message is 4..ahh!
[12:22:20] <devOlsen> microhaxo, can you show us the ajax snip?
[12:22:27] <barry_> that will actually load a js object and inside is an object
[12:22:36] <microhaxo> http://jsfiddle.net/HqGD8/
[12:22:55] <microhaxo> tried with dataType: "jsonp"
[12:22:57] <microhaxo> same result
[12:22:59] <microhaxo> error
[12:23:18] <devOlsen> is this code snip being ran from http://zip.elevenbasetwo.com?
[12:23:30] <microhaxo> no
[12:23:36] <devOlsen> that is the problem then.
[12:23:39] <devOlsen> crossdomain
[12:23:42] <barry_> yep its cross domain
[12:23:46] <microhaxo> yea how can i fix
[12:23:47] <barry_> use jsonp
[12:23:50] <microhaxo> lol
[12:23:54] <microhaxo> I did, same problem
[12:24:08] <barry_> 1 sec
[12:24:18] <devOlsen> you add a crossdomain.xml policy file to that http://zip.elevenbasetwo.com domain.
[12:24:31] <devOlsen> if you don't have access to do that, your out of luck I believe.
[12:24:52] <brandonmerritt> greets
[12:24:54] <barry_> Can you control the output on the json request url?
[12:25:04] <microhaxo> http://jsfiddle.net/3DVjf/
[12:25:16] <barry_> better to use json p
[12:25:31] <barry_> js can load js files from other servers
[12:25:43] <microhaxo> No: http://zip.elevenbasetwo.com was just a site that was in the tutorial. I am trying to use it to make sure it works then i'll be using my own service but i'd like to fully get this one working first.
[12:25:55] <barry_> is http://zip.elevenbasetwo.com yours?
[12:25:58] <microhaxo> No
[12:26:03] <microhaxo> it was in a tutorial.
[12:26:10] <barry_> 1 sec
[12:26:10] <devOlsen> can you tell us what the console of IE9 says the error is?
[12:27:25] <microhaxo> the console shows nothing
[12:27:34] <LinzardMac> Anyone with thoughts on how to trigger an animate height effect based on which div / container is in my viewport.. or alternately trigger the animation based on which anchor link is clicked?
[12:27:42] <microhaxo> For whatever reason i cant even hit the breakpoint using IE.
[12:31:10] <LinzardMac> I'm thinking i need to use something similar to a parallax effect but my issue is i need to animate the same fixed element across multiple locations on the page. depending on where i am
[12:31:24] <barry_> just checking - can't get zip.elevenbasetwo.com to accept my requests
[12:32:13] <barry_> you can get position of a div with $('element').position();
[12:32:47] <barry_> you can use $('element').animate($('element').position()) - should move it to that positon
[12:34:12] <monkeybite> Hi everyone! I'm new to the whole JS and JQuery world. Basically I have two divs, where I want to drag item back and forth, and every <li> element in the second list should also appear in a dropdown list. If I remove a <li> element from lthe second list, it will also disappear from the dropdown
[12:34:15] <barry_> get what i mean
[12:34:15] <LinzardMac> barry_:  are you talking to me or someone else?
[12:34:15] <barry_> ?
[12:34:17] <monkeybite> See this example: http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/2/
[12:34:35] <barry_> LinzardMac: you can use $('element').animate($('element').position()) - should move it to that positon
[12:34:42] <monkeybite> In the drop down there should be "Pineapple" and "Orange"
[12:35:05] <LinzardMac> barry_:  i dont want to move anything to a position.. i want to change the height of a container based on the location we are at on a long page..
[12:35:12] <xmaddness> "pineapple under the sea"?
[12:35:14] <LinzardMac> barry_:  did you see the screen shots? If not I can paste again
[12:35:15] <barry_> i just read pineapple and orange and my brain just vomited
[12:35:17] <barry_> :)
[12:35:25] <barry_> again pls
[12:35:36] <monkeybite> haha :D
[12:35:59] <monkeybite> look at the link barry_. Every fruit I drag to the "love list" I want to also be in the drop down
[12:36:04] <LinzardMac>  http://cl.ly/1H141w0e3F2E050r2n1r http://cl.ly/46421T2O1s3e2m3y2X2T
[12:36:21] <LinzardMac> barry_:  this is my html structure: https://gist.github.com/3062243
[12:36:59] <brandonmerritt> hey ajpiano
[12:37:13] <ajpiano> hiya brandonmerritt
[12:37:14] <LinzardMac> barry_:  essentially its a super long smooth scrolling site where each <article> Is a wordpress content area. The goal is to change the height of the white box in the blocks where I have an article with a lot of content/text
[12:37:15] <microhaxo> Ok guys
[12:37:18] <microhaxo> i got the error!
[12:37:40] <brandonmerritt> how goes the plugins redesign?
[12:37:45] <microhaxo> SCRIPT1004: Expected ';'                 ?callback=jQuery15107669642708024554_1341603386408&zip=55429&_=1341603395462, line 1 character 8
[12:38:15] <ajpiano> brandonmerritt: lol on a call right now to work on the docs for the site, it's prety far along
[12:39:01] <brandonmerritt> ajpiano: that's great. i had wanted to get involved and then procrastinated :-\ it's how i roll.
[12:39:17] <ajpiano> what do you want to do?
[12:39:21] <barry_> LinzardMac: i'd have to play with it but i thing using clear:both on css and not setting the height of the box should make it always show all content that is loaded there - am i missing what u r asking?
[12:39:55] <LinzardMac> barry_:  issue is that the box is actually fixed to the top and the content is NOT inside of it in the structure.. So it has to kind of animate separately.
[12:40:24] <brandonmerritt> i'm happy to do anything. wherever there is a need. i'm not much of a backend developer  but i don't mind pretending to be. but seriously, wherever you need help.
[12:41:16] <barry_> monkeybite: look at examples of query sortables for dragging items form list to list - for the drop down i will write something quick:
[12:41:16] <ajpiano> brandonmerritt: you wanna sling some html and css?
[12:41:33] <brandonmerritt> love too
[12:41:38] <brandonmerritt> timeframe?
[12:41:49] <ajpiano> next couple of weeks, let me hit you in pm in a few mins
[12:41:50] <LinzardMac> barry_:  if you look at the screen shots, the top white banner with the tab is fixed to the top and stays there as I scroll up and down. When I scroll to a page that has a bunch of text, the goal is to have the white box drop down to be bigger and the text to fade in. I got the fade in based on scroll offset, but can't get this to work
[12:41:51] <barry_> LinzardMac: checking
[12:41:56] <brandonmerritt> sure
[12:42:28] <monkeybite> barry_ yes the droppable/sortable is NO problem :) it's the droop down connection who is bugging me
[12:44:58] <barry_> monkeybite: so adding to the drop down? u can use  $('#mySelect').append( new Option(text,val,defaultSelected,nowSelected) );
[12:45:35] <LinzardMac> thanks barry_
[12:45:49] <barry_> and on where u want to drop use $('#droponme').droppable(...
[12:46:49] <barry_> hey LinzardMac: think i got the answer:
[12:46:57] <LinzardMac> Ohhh interested barry_ !!!
[12:48:39] <barry_> but no time to test :) - using overflow:none, it $('.element').height() should still work on the elements inside it so you just $('#outerwithrestrictedoverflow').animate(height,$('.select').height())
[12:48:48] <barry_> is that clear enough to test?
[12:49:29] <barry_> LizardMac: hehe i will quickly test
[12:49:58] <LinzardMac> barry_:  there are no elements inside <div id="whitebox"> and that is the one that I need to animate the height of...
[12:50:23] <LinzardMac> barry_:  give me your IP and i'll send you a link to my test site..
[12:50:36] <LinzardMac> its probably easier for you to see...
[12:52:25] <ajpiano> brandonmerritt: you there?
[12:52:35] <brandonmerritt> ajpiano: indeed
[12:52:45] <ajpiano> sent you some pms ;)
[12:52:56] <chris_mh> that's not a good thing to send someone
[12:52:58] <lotus> hey, using jquery ui tabs, how can I trigger a tab select on page load?
[12:53:01] <ajpiano> lol
[12:53:06] <ajpiano> ?wp @ chris_mh
[12:53:06] <bot-t> chris_mh, well played
[12:53:33] <brandonmerritt> ajpiano: weird i didn't get them. colloquy isn't doing it's thing.
[12:53:35] <chris_mh> is there a way to *get* datepicker options?
[12:53:41] <ajpiano> brandonmerritt: try sending me a msg ?
[12:53:41] <lotus> nevermind, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4893944/how-do-you-call-the-tabselect-event-when-selecting-a-jquery-ui-tab-programmatica
[12:53:46] * ajpiano /msg ?
[12:53:52] <chris_mh> I can see an easy way to set them, but getting them is nonobvious
[12:57:42] <monkeybite> barry_
[12:57:43] <monkeybite> http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/5/
[12:58:43] <gnarf> chris_mh: datepicker is so old that none of the new ways work on it
[12:59:07] <barry_> sorry guys, got to run - enjoy :)
[12:59:11] <gnarf> chris_mh: on a newer widget you should be able to .data('datepicker').options
[12:59:23] <gnarf> chris_mh: not sure if datepicker even uses that format though, but you can try!
[13:00:27] <chris_mh> cannot read property 'options' of undefined
[13:00:28] <chris_mh> :<
[13:00:35] <monkeybite> based on that link, how to implement "$('#mySelect').append( new Option(text,val,defaultSelected,nowSelected) );"?
[13:10:21] <monkeybite> Anyone left? :)
[13:10:48] <monkeybite> I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/5/ where I want to show all the items in the "Fruits I love"-list in the drop down list aswell
[13:13:42] <Posterdati> please I need help to make galleriffic works in a jquery dialog
[13:14:31] <chris_mh> holy crap
[13:14:35] <chris_mh> $.datepicker uses tables
[13:14:49] <jedimind> a calendar is basically one of 3 cases where its okay to use tables...
[13:14:50] <chris_mh> I ... guess it's tabular data ... maybe sort of kinda ...
[13:17:02] <__builtins__> yay, fun nicknames
[13:17:04] <__builtins__> about time
[13:17:51] <__builtins__> where in the world does datepicker store its config data
[13:17:53] <__builtins__> bah
[13:45:36] <aghouseh> anyone have a snippet offhand to "natural" sort an array of jquery objects by their text() value? :D
[13:45:47] <aghouseh> er i guess.. on-hand in that context
[13:47:35] <innociv__> http://unity3d.com/?mecanim What do you all this kind of layout? Is there a plugin that makes it easy?  Where things slide up or to the side based off scroll position.
[13:48:09] <aghouseh> boy i wouldnt think there is anything that makes that "easy" per se.
[13:48:16] <aghouseh> as much as jquery already makes things "easy"
[13:50:14] <cohitre> innociv__: the technique is called parrallax
[13:50:30] <aghouseh> think he means the headings sliding in
[13:50:34] <aghouseh> not the different scrolling rates
[13:51:03] <innociv__> I meant that too
[13:51:16] <aghouseh> ah
[13:51:18] <innociv__> I wanted to find the new ford fushion splash site thing, but I could only find the main site. It did that
[13:52:11] <innociv__> http://curtain.victorcoulon.fr/#stepbystep Looks like what I was looking for
[13:54:04] <innociv__> http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrolldeck.js/decks/parallax/
[13:54:07] <innociv__> Thanks, cohitre
[14:46:19] <lotus> hey, I need to do an animated slide onMouseHover continuously.  I see several people suggesting setInterval (which is choppy and doesn't stop immediately)  and I see other people suggesting some form of flag and recursion... What's the best way to do this?
[14:49:57] <ColKurtz> lotus, what exactly are you trying to animate?
[14:52:22] <lotus> ColKurtz: the margins on a div nested in an overflow:hidden div
[14:52:39] <lotus> ColKurtz: I want the inner div to "scroll" when someone hovers over an arrow
[14:53:18] <ColKurtz> ah
[14:53:50] <ColKurtz> lotus, maybe the jquery scrollTo plugin can help
[14:55:21] <lotus> ColKurtz: that could help, thankyou.
[14:55:39] <lotus> ColKurtz: rather than scrolling over 50 px continuously, I can just scroll over to the next image...
[14:55:46] <ColKurtz> or how about this lotus http://jsfiddle.net/n7adD/
[14:56:47] <ColKurtz> so that plugin calls itself recursively
[14:56:48] <josefig> when you set a div as display:none some scripts (like harvest fancy select) is not working properly, why is that ?
[14:57:14] <ColKurtz> perhaps because you're hiding a div that needs to be shown?
[14:58:03] <ColKurtz> Sometimes a script will clone that element (like with a lightbox), and if that element itself has display:none; then it won't work. The solution is to place the element as the child of a different element with display;None;
[14:59:36] <josefig> ColKurtz, oh I understand now, so If I set a parent element and set it as display:none; the children elements could be used normally ?
[15:06:56] <hron84> Hi! I trying use .load() to load an page content dynamically into a div. However, the link in loaded content will not being binded. Code: http://pastie.org/4212563 So, when I load page what contains .pageloader links, it will not being binded to this func
[15:07:08] <hron84> how can i fix it?
[15:09:23] <shoky> hron84 you probably need to delegate the event handling to a static container element
[15:09:58] <hron84> shoky: for example, for #content?
[15:10:15] <shoky> i think so
[15:10:20] <shoky> smth like:
[15:10:47] <shoky> $('#content').on('click', '.pageloader', function(e) { ... });
[15:10:55] <ColKurtz> $("#content").on('click', '.selected', function(){ alert("This works for links loaded with a .selected class"); });
[15:11:18] <ColKurtz> haha
[15:11:24] <shoky> huha
[15:11:31] <hron84> trying out
[15:11:42] <ColKurtz> Read about jQuery delegate
[15:11:45] <ColKurtz> ?delegate
[15:11:46] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[15:11:49] <shoky> not delegate
[15:11:55] <shoky> ?on @ hron84
[15:11:55] <bot-t> hron84, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:12:19] <ColKurtz> Well delegate explains how it works, on() is just a wrapper
[15:12:25] <shoky> nope
[15:12:42] <ColKurtz> I mean the concept of event delegation
[15:12:59] <shoky> which is explained in the docs for .on()  :P
[15:13:05] <Zzaichik> .delegate() is being deprecated
[15:13:10] <ColKurtz> it's not deprecated
[15:13:12] <ColKurtz> it's superceded
[15:13:18] <hron84> i never ever used event delegation
[15:13:28] <hron84> i just used on() as a click() replacement
[15:13:29] <Salvager> can you place PHP inside jquery documents?
[15:13:42] <hron84> because i read click() is being deprecated
[15:14:03] <Zzaichik> BEING deprecated ..I believe. You can still use .delegate() currently, I would just advise against it.
[15:14:03] <catcher> hron84, then you have used delegation.
[15:14:37] <hron84> no i used click in this case: $('.active').click(function(e) { } );
[15:14:38] <ColKurtz> It's not in the process of being deprecated either, Zzaichik
[15:14:49] <ColKurtz> live() is deprecated.
[15:15:23] <catcher> hron84, if you've used .on(), you've used delegation :)
[15:15:35] <ColKurtz> not necessarily
[15:15:57] <ColKurtz> $("a").on('click', function(){ ... }); is not event delegation
[15:16:54] <Zzaichik> ah yes. I see, I see
[15:18:10] <catcher> that'd depend on the existence of "a" elements, no?
[15:24:18] <Zzaichik> hmmm ColKurtz, your example is basically the same as   $('a').click(function() {});   right? It's more just simply event handling.
[15:25:05] <shoky> it's the same yes
[15:25:08] <Zzaichik> versus event delegation
[15:25:12] <Zzaichik> yeah that's what I thought.
[15:27:44] <jyg> I'm doing a  .is(':hover'), and it works just find in Chrome, but in IE7/8compat  I get the ol' 'Syntax error, unrecognized expression: hover'
[15:27:59] <Zzaichik> So here's another question.  Is it better to use .on() for all event handling?
[15:28:38] <Zzaichik> $('element:hover')
[15:28:44] <jyg> there seems to be a few issues related ':hover', but nthing that i've found addresses
[15:29:10] <jyg> Zzaichik, i'd like to, but the element is a htmlElement object
[15:29:32] <jyg> which is why I'm using the .is()
[15:30:04] <hron84> ?load
[15:30:05] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[15:30:21] <jyg> if it had an id, which is doesn't, i could print the id into the selector and use your idea
[15:33:36] <dshap> hey guys - i'm seeing in Firebug that my jquery ajax request is returning 200 but firebug/jquery thinks there's an error.  i looked at the 3 parameters to the jQuery ajax error callback and textStatus just says "error" and "errorThrown" is undefined.  if i copy+paste the URL that i'm trying to load directly into my browser's address bar, it works.  any ideas?
[15:34:08] <jyg> are you getting json back?
[15:34:22] <dshap> jyg: nope.  after googling i found some people had issues expecting JSON and not getting JSON, that doesn't apply to me
[15:34:33] <dshap> jyg: i'm getting text/html and I'm requesting text/html
[15:34:36] <jyg> i was wondering if your json was broken
[15:34:45] <jyg> hmm dunno then, sorry
[15:35:29] <jyg> can you console.log() the return of the ajax call?
[15:36:05] <dshap> jyg: what exactly do you mean by that?
[15:36:11] <dshap> jyg: i'm getting the error callback
[15:36:29] <dshap> console.log(thatCallbackFunc) ?
[15:37:03] <dshap> wait
[15:37:07] <dshap> that doesn't make any sense, sorry
[15:37:24] <jyg> how do you know its returning 200?
[15:37:34] <jyg> network tab?
[15:37:42] <jyg> oh hmm firebug, ihavent used firebug in a while
[15:38:13] <dshap> jyg: firebug console and network tab, yep
[15:38:45] <jyg> so how do you know your getting an error from the ajax call?
[15:39:01] <dshap> jyg: because jQuery is calling my error callback
[15:39:02] <jyg> i mean how do you know that's the source of the error
[15:39:16] <jyg> you said that your error callback was saying your error info was underfined
[15:39:22] <dshap> jyg: it is
[15:39:27] <jyg> to me that'd mean there's no ajax error
[15:39:35] <jyg> do you have a success callback?
[15:39:39] <dshap> jyg: yes, and it
[15:39:42] <dshap> it's not being called
[15:39:51] <SegFaultAX|work2> Is it possible to get a callback when a mustache template is done rendering?
[15:40:35] <dshap> SegFaultAX|work2: isn't rendering a mustache template a synchronous operation?
[15:40:39] <jyg> dshap, how are you printing the err objs?
[15:41:06] <dshap> jyg: console.log(param)
[15:41:24] <jyg> hmm dunno without combing you code/running it
[15:41:33] <jyg> s/you/your/
[15:42:38] <dshap> jyg: would it make any difference is jQuery was loaded on a site from http://someHostName:8000/ and it is making an ajax call to http://someHostName/ ?
[15:42:45] <dshap> any cross-domain issues or something there?
[15:43:19] <SegFaultAX|work2> dshap: Nevermind, ignore me.

[15:45:23] <jyg> shap, yes, crosssite includes samesite:diffport
[15:45:44] <Zzaichik> A followup to my last question: So would it be better to use .on() for all event handling and not just event delegation?
[15:47:39] <dshap> jyg: i think i need to return json
[15:47:46] <dshap> jyg: I'm going to try
[15:47:49] <dshap> jyg: thanks for your help!
[15:49:48] <lotus> fa/last lotus
[15:50:04] <lotus> ColKurtz: hey that's cool
[15:53:46] <shoky> Zzaichik: it's fine to use the shortcuts like .click, and it's also fine to use .bind or .delegate (tho these 2 _might_ get removed someday)
[15:53:49] <jyg> Zzaichik, so i figured out a way to put a temp id on the element and then use that id to do 'element:hover' ... still getting syntax error O.o .... hah now I'm totally surprised, thanks for trying though
[15:54:21] <shoky> Zzaichik: if you're not already used to .bind and .delegate, then sticking with .on is probably good
[15:54:37] <shoky> Zzaichik: the only one to really avoid is .live
[15:55:36] <Salvager> does remove_meta_box work with everything at the edit page admin UI?
[15:55:54] <Salvager> etc. can i remove publish post with it?
[15:57:17] <Salvager> wrong chat sorry
[15:58:49] <Zzaichik> shoky: Awesome, thank you.
[15:59:15] <Zzaichik> jyg: d'oh, Yeah that's strange. Sorry I wasn't more helpful.

[16:38:53] <jiu> I need some help with jqgrid please
[16:43:10] <SrPx> Is there a name for jquery object? Don't know what to call them, button_element, button_dom, button_jquery_element ... ?
[16:45:34] <ScottG> SrPx: Not sure what you're asking. Are you trying to figure out how to name your variables consistantly?
[16:45:45] <SrPx> ScottG: yes.
[16:46:28] <SrPx> ScottG: Just wondering if there is a conventional way to call a jQuery object (I mean, the result of, for example, jQuery("#myElement") )
[16:47:04] <ScottG> SrPx: You know you can just do $("#myElement"), right?
[16:47:17] <SrPx> ScottG: yes
[16:47:25] <ScottG> Ok, just making sure.
[16:47:30] <SrPx> ScottG: allright!
[16:47:59] <ScottG> That's a good question. I'm fairly new and I haven't stored many jq objects like that in vars before.
[16:48:23] <ScottG> I'd name them whatever they represent on the page/in the dom.
[16:48:27] <phonebook_> var $obj = $(selector); $obj.hide();
[16:48:59] <ScottG> phonebook_: Ah yes I think I've seen that convention before. You just prepend $
[16:49:51] <sic1> thats the standard at my work now
[16:50:36] <gnarf> ?ask @jiu
[16:50:36] <bot-t> jiu, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:50:38] <jiu> You could just have a js file with all your declared vars and then just use them
[16:50:48] <jiu> I do that very often
[16:51:26] <gnarf> also, see ?cik
[16:51:27] <bot-t> also, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[16:52:33] <jiu> Does anyone has implemented tree grid of jqgrid plugin?
[16:53:36] <gnarf> jiu: sounds like that falls under "Don't look for topic experts" :)
[16:55:00] <Es0teric> i have a contact form that i want to send post data to from a form
[16:55:06] <gnarf> jiu: in other words, its unlikely that someone has, but that doesn't mean we might not be able to help you find a solution if you ask your question anyway and show us some code and explain what isn't working
[16:55:19] <Es0teric> but when i click on "send", it doesnt show any of the stuff i typed in the console
[16:55:34] <Es0teric> i did console.log($('#formid').text());
[16:55:42] <gnarf> Es0teric: .val()
[16:55:52] <gnarf> Es0teric: see ?serializeArray
[16:55:53] <bot-t> Es0teric, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[16:56:09] <Es0teric> gnarf whaty?
[16:56:10] <Es0teric> *what?
[16:56:11] <gnarf> or even see ?serialize
[16:56:11] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[16:56:24] <gnarf> Es0teric: #formid is an input, it has a value - not a text
[16:56:32] <gnarf> or rather text != value
[16:56:38] <gnarf> get the form element values
[16:56:47] <gnarf> the serializeArray function does that if you pass it a form
[16:56:57] <gnarf> it will give you an object back that has key/value pairs
[16:57:42] <jiu> Ok @gnarf..ill paste my code
[16:57:46] <gnarf> you could use $("#formid").val() -- or you might be able to just get all the data
[16:57:48] <Es0teric> gnarf i am doing an ajax form submission though
[16:57:59] <gnarf> ?ajaxForm @Es0teric
[16:57:59] <bot-t> Es0teric, ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#download
[16:58:14] <gnarf> ^^^ that plugin is very useful
[16:58:19] <Es0teric> man... i dont want to use any more plugins...
[16:58:26] <gnarf> so don't use it
[16:58:32] <gnarf> it doesn't mean you can't look at how they do it
[16:58:45] <gnarf> because they have probably solved problems you haven't even thought of yet :)
[16:59:00] <gnarf> perhaps created a few as well
[16:59:24] <Es0teric> lol
[16:59:28] <gnarf> Es0teric: $("#theform").serialize() returns a string that you can pass to the data of an ajax call
[16:59:37] <Es0teric> gnarf well can i show you what i have
[17:01:11] <gnarf> Es0teric: if it is #("#formid").text() it's wrong
[17:01:13] <gnarf> see ?val
[17:01:14] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[17:01:29] <Es0teric> gnarf its actually at .val()
[17:01:34] <Es0teric> and its showing me the information
[17:01:34] <gnarf> okay
[17:01:40] <Es0teric> but when i submit the form, by clicking send
[17:01:48] <Es0teric> it doesnt process on the contactform.php page
[17:01:55] <Es0teric> eventhough i filled it out, it shows that theres no data
[17:02:14] <gnarf> what does the network tab of the inspector say?
[17:02:31] <Es0teric> 200ok
[17:02:35] <Es0teric> on the ajax request
[17:02:44] <gnarf> what headers / request body did it send?
[17:02:48] <gnarf> does it have your form elements
[17:02:49] <Es0teric> uhh lemme check
[17:02:51] <gnarf> is it POST or GET
[17:02:59] <gnarf> these are all things that could be issues
[17:03:06] <Es0teric> how do i find out in firebug
[17:03:07] <Es0teric> its POST
[17:03:08] <Es0teric> not get
[17:03:32] <gnarf> Um, firebug... *starts firefox and goes to find an ajax request*
[17:04:15] <Es0teric> theres nothing on the post, gnarf
[17:04:18] <Es0teric> the post is empty
[17:04:27] <k1ng__> what is the best WYSIWYG Editor?
[17:04:29] <gnarf> okay, so what is the "data" argument to the ajax call
[17:04:36] <gnarf> console.log() it before it's sent
[17:04:59] <tw2113> i am the Batman
[17:05:00] <gnarf> or
[17:05:07] <gnarf> just put a breakpoint at the ajax call
[17:05:17] <gnarf> and use the console to echo out the data :)
[17:05:37] <Es0teric> oh shit...
[17:05:41] <Es0teric> i am missing the data argument
[17:05:43] <Es0teric> DURRRR
[17:05:50] <Es0teric> no wonder
[17:06:15] <gnarf> usually helps to send data ;)
[17:06:34] <Es0teric> gnarf but how do i do the data argument?
[17:06:34] <gnarf> you should make your php script error with a 400 response code
[17:06:46] <gnarf> Es0teric: if its already a <form> element
[17:07:03] <gnarf> I'd do data: $("#theform").serialize()
[17:07:13] <Es0teric> wait
[17:07:20] <gnarf> otherwise you can build a custom object
[17:08:02] <gnarf> or for the measly cost of including one more plugin, just do $("#theform").ajaxSubmit({success: function( response ) { } });
[17:08:36] <gnarf> and it will read the url from the form element and everything :)
[17:08:55] <Es0teric> wait what?
[17:08:59] <Es0teric> ajaxSubmit()
[17:09:05] <gnarf> ?ajaxForm
[17:09:06] <bot-t> ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#download
[17:09:13] <gnarf> ^^^
[17:09:13] <gnarf> :)
[17:09:14] <teear> i am naked
[17:09:15] <Es0teric> yeah thats the form
[17:09:16] <Es0teric> -_-
[17:09:32] <teear> i am still naked
[17:09:39] <Es0teric> gnarf, if i do var data = $('#theform').serialize();
[17:09:47] <gnarf> Es0teric: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#api
[17:09:51] <Es0teric> i can pass data into the data parameter
[17:09:53] <gnarf> look at ajaxSubmit() it's nice
[17:10:06] <Es0teric> dude
[17:10:10] <gnarf> Es0teric: yes, but its not an object ... so don't expect it to behave like one :)
[17:10:11] <Es0teric> maybe down the line i'll use a plugin
[17:10:17] <teear> i wanna suck yeer bootiboutibee in yeer dickalicking sickdicksoup
[17:10:31] <Es0teric> gnarf ok so then how do i do the data parameter?
[17:10:39] <gnarf> teear: seriously?
[17:11:01] <teear> i wannu smurf yeer butterbuttocks
[17:11:06] <gnarf> Es0teric: data: form.serialize()  --- or var data = form.serialize(); $.ajax({ data: data });
[17:11:33] <teear> seriously?
[17:11:36] <teear> no
[17:11:45] <Es0teric> and form would be var form = $('#idofform'); right?
[17:11:53] <teear> I wanna smurf your smurffingwarffum
[17:11:54] <gnarf> Es0teric: yup
[17:12:00] <Es0teric> got it
[17:15:06] <Es0teric> FUCKIN RIGHT...
[17:15:52] <Es0teric> gnarf another question... how would i make my php script return a 400 when theres no data being sent?
[17:16:11] <gnarf> Es0teric: header("400 Invalid Request"); I think
[17:16:22] <gnarf> Es0teric: but don't quote me, ask google :)
[17:16:32] <Es0teric> gnarf so i just do that on the top?
[17:16:36] <gnarf> ?g php generate 400 response code
[17:16:38] <bot-t> gnarf, PHP: cURL - Manual - http://php.net/manual/es/book.curl.php
[17:16:38] <Es0teric> i dont need to do a condition
[17:16:42] <gnarf> boo
[17:16:45] <gnarf> Es0teric: well like
[17:16:51] <gnarf> you know whatever makes it an invalid response
[17:16:55] <gnarf> er request
[17:17:05] <gnarf> like doesn't have $_POST["name"] or whatever
[17:17:27] <gnarf> you should check that its a valid request, and if not, return an error response code
[17:17:41] <gnarf> just kinda a nice thing to do for your own sanity :)
[17:17:53] <tw2113> wouldn't you have error callback options
[17:19:41] <quickq> hi all, is there a way to get the ajaxOptions from complete in: $.ajax( settings1: value, complete: function(){} )
[17:19:54] <gnarf> tw2113: that and it looks like an error in firebug/inspector
[17:20:02] <gnarf> quickq: check "this"
[17:20:11] <quickq> thank you gnaf
[17:20:16] <gnarf> quickq: i'm pretty sure thats the options, although they have been modified slightly
[17:20:25] <gnarf> like data will have been normalized to a string, etc
[17:20:36] <quickq> oh.. i will check that, thanks gnarf
[17:22:26] <gnarf> quickq: there might actually be an "originalOptions" property on it or something like that
[17:22:41] <quickq> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/, no.. i dont see it
[17:22:54] <gnarf> right
[17:22:57] <gnarf> it wont be an option
[17:23:12] <gnarf> but it might be stored on the "this" in the complete callback
[17:23:13] <quickq> i'm not following you.. it's a hidden value?
[17:23:15] <quickq> I see
[17:23:29] <quickq> yes I am going to try that :) thanks gnarf for that lead
[17:23:47] <gnarf> the "this" is the options that were used basically
[17:23:53] <gnarf> after they were fitlered
[17:28:41] <Es0teric> .find() can be used to find classes too right?
[17:29:19] <gnarf> Es0teric: any css selector
[17:29:22] <gnarf> so yes
[17:44:22] <eip56> So I have a small script that replaces content for a "search" box. It works in all browsers but Chrome. Anyone have some insight that could help me
[17:44:24] <eip56> http://hastebin.com/tovuroxode.coffee
[17:44:58] <eip56> script can be seen in use here http://southwestspeed.net/dev right sidebar search boxes for make model and year
[17:48:22] <phonebook_> doesnt work in safari either
[17:49:04] <shoky> click isn't really supported on <option>
[17:49:35] <shoky> better to use the change event on the <select>
[17:49:44] <Jon47> eip56: anyway you can avoid using so many descendent selectors and all that parent().siblings() nonsense
[17:50:37] <eip56> talking about .change() right shoky
[17:51:16] <shoky> yeah
[17:51:25] <shoky> same as .on('change',
[17:51:34] <eip56> Ok ill try reworking it with that thanks all
[20:02:51] <kamo> hello all
[20:02:58] <kamo> Good evening
[20:06:02] <shoky> hi helo
[20:26:30] <jonkersjoe> Hi,  I want to take the name attribute from a textbox and use it as the name of the variable of a object and assign the value of the textbox to assign it to the said variable. How would I do this ?
[20:31:51] <quickq> jonkersjoe your second request nyou need to clarify, "use it as the name of the variable of a object'
[20:32:33] <quickq> nvm i figured it out
[20:33:30] <quickq> jonkersjoe, var name = $('select your stuff here).attr('name'); var y = $('textbox here').val(); eval(name + " = ' " + y + " ' ; ");
[20:35:55] <jonkersjoe> quickq: Thanks to add it to an object would it be var name=$("#asdas").attr('name'); var val = $("#asdas").val(); obj.[name]=val;
[20:36:06] <jonkersjoe> or something like that ?
[20:36:32] <quickq> oh, you want to do that, yea pretty much
[20:36:35] <quickq> try it
[20:36:37] <quickq> jsfiddle.net
[20:37:13] <jonkersjoe> ok cool thanks quickq
[20:38:29] <DannysDad> Hi.  I have a jquery if clause "if($(this).hasClass("xx-yy-wide")) { ...".
[20:38:32] <DannysDad> I'd like to do something similar for any of three classes, and use the last part of the classname inside the if clause.
[20:38:43] <DannysDad> In effect, "if($(this).hasClass("xx-yy-<any of wide/normal/narrow>")) { ... use Z = whatever 'this is', =wide, =narrow, or =normal"
[20:39:01] <DannysDad> How could I "get at" and use that last part of the classname?
[20:39:23] <bencahill> Hey guys, I have two ul's with li's with data-id attributes. Is there an easy to way to remove elements from the second that don't have a matching data-id in the first?
[20:43:12] <bencahill> Hmm, I guess I need filter(function() { bla... again
[20:43:52] <shoky> bencahill, smth like: var ids = $('#ul1 > li').map(function(el) { return $(el).data('id') });   $('#ul2 > li').filter( function() { return $.inArray( $(this).data('id'), ids ) == -1 } ).remove();
[20:44:37] <bencahill> shoky: Ah, that looks nice. Thanks. :)
[20:44:45] <shoky> ;]
[20:47:10] <shoky> DannysDad: it'd be easier to answer if you make a jsfiddle
[21:00:14] <DannysDad> shoky: hi.  a what?  Googling ...
[21:00:49] <stan_man_can> Is there any good calendars for mobile?
[21:00:54] <stan_man_can> I need to be able to select a date
[21:02:39] <Stephen> This question is way off, but are there any artists here?
[21:03:02] <Pwnna> i'm currently remembering a bunch of elements so they're dynamically added to the page as needed, the thing is that these elements/nodes have some click actions
[21:03:10] <Pwnna> and they seem to disappear when i remove them from the page and reappend them
[21:04:17] <Stephen> Pwnna: use .detach() instead of .remove()
[21:04:34] <Pwnna> http://jsfiddle.net/GaPP2/
[21:04:36] <Pwnna> oh
[21:04:37] <Pwnna> okay
[21:04:48] <Pwnna> Stephen: but what if i want to empty, that's my other case
[21:05:09] <Stephen> ?? Explain
[21:05:13] <DannysDad> shoky: Pretty neat!  Here is is: http://jsfiddle.net/4M8z2/.  I'd like to refactor that to one 'if' that cleverly handles the width name.
[21:05:26] <Stephen> .detach() removes a node from the DOM, but retains all it's jQuery references
[21:05:38] <Pwnna> .contents().detach();
[21:05:41] <Pwnna> hm okay
[21:05:53] <Stephen> If you want to get rid of it before re-appending, simply delete the object
[21:07:04] <Pwnna> Stephen: nono, the thing is i want to be able to preserve some click callback before removing and reappending
[21:07:09] <Pwnna> but then i want to mass remove
[21:07:13] <Pwnna> i found my solution, however :D
[21:07:42] <Pwnna> thanks :D
[21:14:50] <DannysDad> I.e., jsfiddle or not, how do I extract the value of ZZZZ from "if($(this).hasClass("xx-yy-ZZZZ")) {"? /me scratches head ...
[21:20:05] <SrPx> someone was yelling at a channel there that it is stupid to include jquery.js if you are only using part of it, because it is big.
[21:20:27] <Stephen> :-/
[21:20:30] <SrPx> now that I think about it, serioulsy? it is smaller than a small image... does it really make a difference?
[21:20:56] <Stephen> Well, jquery is now offering ways to slim down the package, but the whole library is not that large
[21:21:25] <Stephen> If they are that worried about it, use a cdn
[21:22:43] <SrPx> Is ~90kb really relevant? Won't any site containing just a few images easily pass 1mb?
[21:23:01] <Stephen> SrPx: Not really, it depends on the site
[21:23:11] <SrPx> hmm
[21:23:16] <Stephen> Correct use of CSS can keep a site very small
[21:23:32] <Stephen> That being said, my site clocks in over 1MB after a few pages
[21:23:34] <bencahill> box-shading et. al are awesome!
[21:23:44] <Stephen> But I make heavy use of transparent PNGs
[21:23:46] <SrPx> Stephen: do you have any problem with that
[21:24:04] <SrPx> because of that*
[21:24:16] <Stephen> Seeing a 300K file as a mere part of a website is very common these days
[21:24:25] <Stephen> Unless you are targeting mobile, I wouldn't worry about it
[21:25:35] <Stephen> I make use of optipng, pngcrush, and do what I can to keep the bandwidth down. But my site is a game, my users want to be engrossed, not super-efficient info navigation
[21:25:50] <Stephen> always take into account your audience
[21:26:50] <Stephen> point being: If your target audience is completely dominated by South Africans, Islanders, and dialup users, then jquery is most definitely an issu
[21:26:52] <Stephen> issue
[21:27:33] <Stephen> If your target audience is the rest of the semi-adequate bandwidth, lazy cache clearing public, I think you're good.
[21:39:23] <bencahill> Hey guys, I'm using the Galleriffic jQuery plugin, and I need to change the thumbnails (what it uses), but it doesn't have a method to re-initialize, reading them from scratch (at least afaict)...how might I remove the object from whatever it is doing so I can re-initialize it?
[21:46:14] <quickq> delete var; ?
[21:46:18] <quickq> maybe that'll work
[21:46:25] <quickq> or check the api to see if there's a destroy function
[21:53:10] <shoky> DannysDad: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/wgtUp/  might not be what you needed, cause you weren't specific enough
[21:53:51] <shoky> (sorry for the delay)
[21:55:54] <DannysDad> shoky I think I actually understabd that, and it seems to do what I need.  Thanks!
[21:56:11] <tw2113> shoky is another person's hero
[21:57:15] <shoky> anyone's except my own
[21:57:43] <DannysDad> ta!
