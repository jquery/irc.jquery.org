[01:00:36] <surianup> Hi guys
[01:00:58] <surianup> hope you all are doing well
[01:41:00] <strayArchie> So if I have a script that calculates the padding on clicks, how could I run the script on load as well --- http://stro.nz/portfolio/js/filetree.html?v=0.4
[01:48:56] <strayArchie> got it
[02:31:18] <Enerel> load if there is new entry in DB reload every 5sec but my whole UL flashes and blank why? https://jsfiddle.net/v0e2mue1/
[02:33:00] <oihge9> i'm assigning $('.filter > input').keyup(function(e) { $('#content').html(data) });  When i type a character into input, the page reloads as expect, but also reloads the input. That means that the .keyup is not assigned anymore to the now loaded input and it stops working. What can i do?
[02:35:49] <oihge9> oh, i need .on delegation
[02:36:40] <Enerel> load if there is new entry in DB reload every 5sec but my whole UL flashes and blank why? https://jsfiddle.net/v0e2mue1/
[02:37:22] <Enerel> UL load if there is new entry in DB reload every 5sec to check, but my whole UL flashes and blank why? https://jsfiddle.net/v0e2mue1/
[02:44:54] <Enerel> UL load if there is new entry in DB reload every 5sec to check, but my whole UL flashes and blank why? https://jsfiddle.net/v0e2mue1/
[02:53:25] <Enerel> why append is not adding but removing?
[02:53:35] <Enerel> anyone here plz
[02:55:46] <Enerel> load is always replacing?
[02:56:21] <arc_> When a successful response is detected (i.e. when textStatus is "success" or "notmodified"), .load() sets the HTML contents of the matched element to the returned data.
[02:57:03] <arc_> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[02:59:02] <arc_> just use .ajax() instead of .load() so you can place the data however you want
[02:59:22] <Enerel> arc_ i have updated the script
[02:59:23] <Enerel> https://jsfiddle.net/v0e2mue1/1/
[02:59:41] <arc_> ok, that works i guess
[02:59:53] <Enerel> it works fine but if there is no new entry in DB it still shows new LI
[03:00:02] <arc_> yep
[03:00:10] <Enerel> empty LI
[03:00:17] <Enerel> how to avoid it?
[03:00:40] <arc_> with this method i don't think you will be able to
[03:00:50] <arc_> you can't create the element in the success callback
[03:01:37] <arc_> if you use .ajax() you can set the data to a variable and then append that
[03:01:52] <Enerel> okay
[03:02:12] <Enerel> does ajax have append?
[03:02:59] <arc_> i don't think so. you would just place your append in the done callback
[03:04:32] <Enerel> thanks i will try and let you know
[03:06:43] <Enerel> arc_ : how do you define callback status to error
[03:08:27] <arc_> i'm sorry, can you repeat that
[03:08:32] <arc_> er rephrase
[03:10:14] <arc_> if you're asking what i think you're asking, look here
[03:10:15] <arc_> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[03:10:31] <arc_> for where it shows done/fail/always
[03:13:38] <Enerel> arc_ : i dont know what am i doing now https://jsfiddle.net/v0e2mue1/3/
[03:15:07] <arc_> did you look at the link
[03:15:29] <arc_> idk where you're getting this from but that looks like some outdated stuff
[03:16:08] <Enerel> okay let me try again
[03:16:30] <arc_> you should be using done/fail
[03:16:43] <arc_> there is an example in the link
[03:17:10] <arc_> a little more than halfway down the page
[03:18:25] <Enerel> https://jsfiddle.net/v0e2mue1/5/
[03:18:53] <Enerel> much better? am i getting close?
[03:20:27] <Pazician> Why doesn't this remove the class when the anchor is clicked? https://jsfiddle.net/mhqetjLw/
[03:20:35] <Enerel> arc_ :  https://jsfiddle.net/v0e2mue1/5/
[03:20:39] <Pazician> It's just scrolling to an sectionÂ¨
[03:20:49] <arc_> why did you use post?
[03:22:10] <Enerel> there was no example on GET
[03:22:25] <Enerel> and also i just thought POST is more reliable
[03:22:42] <arc_> that is an optional parameter
[03:22:46] <arc_> default is get
[03:23:20] <Enerel> okay
[03:24:35] <arc_> try this https://jsfiddle.net/v0e2mue1/6/
[03:26:17] <Enerel> do i have to add sms_load.php?val=" + etc?
[03:26:28] <arc_> that's on line 2
[03:26:49] <arc_> i just put that into one line
[03:27:27] <Enerel> what is GET parameter name? i am feeling quite stupid now
[03:27:47] <arc_> you don't need any of that. you just need the url
[03:27:59] <KoMan> Pazicizn https://jsfiddle.net/mhqetjLw/
[03:28:07] <arc_> the most basic ajax request just needs a url
[03:28:33] <Enerel> i need that id's value in sms_load.php
[03:28:42] <Enerel> how i call it?
[03:28:50] <arc_> yeah that's on line 2 - var url = "sms_load.php" + $('ul#links li:first').attr('id');
[03:29:07] <arc_> er i forgot the question mark apparently
[03:29:30] <arc_> what should the actual url be
[03:29:37] <Enerel> yes i know but i think it is missing the value name
[03:29:42] <Enerel> yes yes
[03:29:47] <Enerel> ?val=
[03:29:57] <arc_> okay, so just add that after php
[03:30:10] <Enerel> okay that's all i was asking thanks
[03:30:35] <Enerel> sorry for my bad english
[03:41:20] <Enerel> arc_ dont know why but it does not work
[03:42:58] <KoMan> Enerel: a suggestion > look in the console for error.
[03:43:23] <arc_> Enerel sorry, it's hard for me to debug when i can't see the results
[03:43:38] <Enerel> live is here http://date.mn/test_sms_load.php
[03:44:27] <arc_> oh, sorry. yeah i accidentally put a semicolon on what is line 31 in your php file
[03:44:57] <KoMan> console...
[03:47:36] <Enerel> arc_ now done is not a function
[03:48:29] <KoMan> try success in ajax
[03:48:37] <KoMan> and error
[03:48:46] <arc_> supposed to use done/fail now
[03:48:47] <Enerel> okay
[03:48:52] <arc_> success and error are deprecated
[03:48:58] <Enerel> oh
[03:49:06] <arc_> Enerel it's a comma after url not a semicolon
[03:50:28] <arc_> wait, you're using jquery 1.3? why?
[03:50:57] <Enerel> ho just copy from internet
[03:51:00] <Enerel> my badd
[03:51:23] <arc_> change it to 1.12.1
[03:52:01] <Enerel> works now
[03:52:09] <arc_> k cool
[03:52:38] <Enerel> can i hug you
[03:52:45] <arc_> lol -_-
[03:53:22] <Enerel> thanks a lot man
[03:53:25] <arc_> you're welcome
[03:53:39] <arc_> btw it's usually better to read the documentation and figure it out that way than trying to use something like stackoverflow
[03:53:46] <arc_> you will frequently come across outdated stuff
[03:54:53] <Enerel> okay roger that
[03:55:02] <KoMan> is success/error replaced with done/fail??
[03:55:10] <arc_> yes
[03:55:26] <arc_> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[03:55:33] <arc_> see here
[03:58:17] <KoMan> got it...
[04:11:51] <Pazician> What could be wrong with this code? I want to click on the a tag and add an class on li and remove on all other ones: https://pastee.org/rhd88
[04:13:45] <Vipii> https://jsfiddle.net/escdhnzx/ , How can I change the value of the First item with javascript? The "Select Tag" ?
[04:13:49] <arc_> Pazician well, you're selecting all li
[04:13:56] <arc_> adding the class to all of them
[04:14:05] <arc_> then looking for all of the siblings of all of them
[04:14:10] <arc_> and removing the class from all of those
[04:14:30] <arc_> do you not want to add the class to the one that was clicked on?
[04:14:36] <Pazician> arc_: Right
[04:14:40] <Pazician> And remove on all other ones
[04:14:56] <arc_> so why are you using $(this).parent().find('li') instead of just $(this)
[04:15:32] <Pazician> arc_: Bcuz I'm targeting the a tag, and a tag is the children to the li
[04:16:02] <KoMan> Pazician : something similar https://jsfiddle.net/dz63672d/
[04:16:21] <arc_> okay. so you're saying the li is the parent of a?
[04:16:29] <Pazician> arc_: Yup
[04:16:31] <arc_> so you just need $(this).parent()
[04:16:36] <arc_> you don't need find() because the parent is the li
[04:18:49] <hellyeah> hey there
[04:18:54] <arc_> KoMan with this you are adding the class to a. he wants to add it to li
[04:18:58] <arc_> or so he says
[04:19:26] <Pazician> arc_: Thank you, worked :)
[04:19:31] <arc_> you're welcome
[04:19:42] <hellyeah> you can create elements with +. After creating click pencil button please. It is not fired. What is the reaosn of that? Can you help me to figure out? http://jsfiddle.net/ga2mmn23/2/
[04:20:22] <KoMan> at first he asked for that only... don't know what changed .. :P
[04:20:29] <arc_> Vipii with vanilla javascript? try ##javascript
[04:20:34] <arc_> idk
[04:20:55] <hellyeah> arc_:  my question is about jquery xD
[04:20:57] <arc_> hellyeah i see no pencil button
[04:21:08] <arc_> i was not addressing you with that
[04:21:49] <arc_> you seem to have }); being rendered as text so you must have a syntax error somewhere
[04:22:19] <hellyeah> sorry just a sec
[04:23:23] <hellyeah> arc_:  here http://jsfiddle.net/ga2mmn23/3/
[04:23:35] <hellyeah> just click + you will see pencil button
[04:24:01] <arc_> okay. so what is the issue
[04:24:10] <arc_> now you have way less javascript here
[04:24:27] <hellyeah> i added updateButton "pencil" dynamically
[04:24:37] <arc_> okay
[04:24:37] <hellyeah> when you click pencil button it is not fired
[04:24:45] <arc_> there is no event bound to it here
[04:24:59] <arc_> event listener*
[04:25:03] <hellyeah> when i get it inside create function it worked
[04:25:11] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:25:13] <arc_> yeah, that makes sense
[04:25:35] <arc_> so why can't you do that
[04:25:39] <hellyeah> do i need to add event to object manually
[04:25:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:25:58] <hellyeah> i just wonder it is possible to make this happen outside?
[04:26:06] <arc_> you can either bind the event listener after creating the object, or you can use delegation
[04:26:21] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:26:24] <hellyeah> just a sec
[04:27:49] <hellyeah> arc_:  delegation? like that http://jsfiddle.net/ga2mmn23/4/
[04:28:39] <arc_> i still don't see any event binding for the element in question
[04:28:52] <hellyeah> pencil butt is updateButton
[04:28:56] <hellyeah> button*
[04:29:16] <arc_> on line 22? how is this different from any other event listener?
[04:29:17] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:29:42] <arc_> this is how delegation works
[04:30:28] <arc_> $('selector for parent element that existed when the page loaded').on('click', 'selector for the dynamically created element you want to be able to click on', function () { ... });
[04:30:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:30:59] <arc_> so $('#datepickerPart').on('click', '.controlButton', function () { ... });
[04:31:10] <hellyeah> you mean bind an event to the parent element?
[04:31:14] <arc_> yes
[04:31:15] <hellyeah> humm
[04:31:24] <hellyeah> let me take a look
[04:32:42] <arc_> i am quite surprised you have lasted this long without using delegation
[04:33:44] <hellyeah> well
[04:34:11] <hellyeah> well you first select parents element then you bind click event to the child element right
[04:34:18] <hellyeah> is this delegation
[04:34:44] <hellyeah> i supposed delegation is like $(element).on(eventname, functionname);
[04:35:13] <DFar> heelyeah : you want to show alert at click on pencil after press to [+] ?
[04:36:05] <DFar> hellyeah: (up) *
[04:36:46] <surianup> Hello friends
[04:36:49] <hellyeah> arc_:  isnt it what you meanty http://jsfiddle.net/ga2mmn23/7/
[04:36:54] <surianup> How are you all
[04:37:10] <surianup> surianup ise calling you friends
[04:38:06] <surianup> I have an issue with autocomplete input box
[04:38:31] <DFar> this result ? http://jsfiddle.net/ga2mmn23/8/
[04:38:42] <surianup> it is working fine in the page but not working correctly in the popup model
[04:40:06] <hellyeah> DFar:  i know you can do it like that but what i want is to execute click to updateButton from outside if it is possible.
[04:41:04] <adam_gillcrist> Hi surianup
[04:41:11] <hellyeah> DFar:  pls tell me if it doesnt make sense
[04:41:25] <surianup> Hello adam_gillcrist
[04:41:25] <hellyeah> i am kinda newbie
[04:41:35] <DFar> hellyeah: Ok, but you need to refresh the event listener after cloning the update button
[04:42:17] <surianup> need some help bussy
[04:42:18] <DFar> otherwise, the listener works only at the first updatebutton (who is hide)
[04:42:21] <surianup> buddy
[04:42:39] <surianup> DFar can you please help me ?
[04:42:46] <DFar> hellyeah : unless I missed something
[04:43:05] <hellyeah> refresh the event listemer
[04:43:30] <hellyeah> DFar:   what i do is cloning content of datepickerPart to datePart when you click + button
[04:43:43] <hellyeah> what i want is to execute click event in the datePart
[04:44:45] <DFar> hellyeah : yes but you put a 'new' updatebutton inside DOM, and the event doesn't work, I already faced it, and I did that way
[04:45:33] <DFar> hellyeah: there may be a cleaner way,  and here I am ready to listen
[04:46:08] <hellyeah> may be i should bind an event to the parent element like
[04:46:09] <DFar> (sorry for my bad english)
[04:46:24] <hellyeah> $('.datePart').bind('on'); or smt
[04:46:29] <hellyeah> my english is bad too :)
[04:46:46] <DFar> Have you read that ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15408394/how-to-copy-a-dom-node-with-event-listeners
[04:47:00] <Mark____> hellyeah hi
[04:47:05] <hellyeah> Mark____:  hey
[04:47:09] <Mark____> my english is bad well.
[04:47:11] <hellyeah> Mark____:  Anyo Haseyo
[04:47:30] <Mark____> just say that in english. itâ€™s not as if i have to be known to other people by my ethnicity
[04:49:45] <hellyeah> i didnt want to offend you i am sorry for that
[04:50:17] <hellyeah> DFar:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2398099/jquery-equivalent-of-javascripts-addeventlistener-methodin jquery bind() and on() binds event to the selector?
[04:50:37] <DFar> hellyeah : wait a sec
[04:51:02] <arc_> hellyeah umm
[04:51:10] <arc_> you put .datepickerPart but that is an id, not a class
[04:51:21] <DFar> hellyeah : http://api.jquery.com/clone/ > .clone( [withDataAndEvents ] [, deepWithDataAndEvents ] ), is there what you want ?
[04:51:28] <hellyeah> sure btw i want to make this to have clearer code. because i have like 600 line of code putting every piece of together make it unnecessarily complicated
[04:51:48] <hellyeah> arc_:  when you click + button all elements are in datePart class
[04:52:11] <hellyeah> DFar:  seems cloning element with events sound handy to me
[04:52:19] <DFar> [deepWithDataAndEvents]> A Boolean indicating whether event handlers and data for all children of the cloned element should be copied. By default its value matches the first argument's value (which defaults to false).
[04:52:23] <arc_> okay... but .datePart is what you are creating
[04:52:29] <arc_> so that doesn't exist when the page loaded either
[04:52:33] <arc_> why didn't you just do it the way i wrote it?
[04:52:53] <hellyeah> clone(true) can do it
[04:53:12] <DFar> clone(true,true) or clone(true) ?
[04:53:20] <hellyeah> not sure let me check
[04:53:26] <hellyeah> arc_:  i have 600 lines of code
[04:53:32] <hellyeah> and several events
[04:53:35] <arc_> ok ;/
[04:53:47] <hellyeah> putting all things together makes code complicated to read and understand
[04:53:52] <hellyeah> i am just search the way
[04:53:54] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[04:54:23] <DFar> <hellyeah> putting all things together makes code complicated to read and understand \\ I agree :)
[04:54:47] <arc_> the first selector needs to select a parent element of .controlButton that existed on page load
[04:54:57] <arc_> so just go up through the dom until you find that
[04:54:59] <hellyeah> DFar:  deepwithdataandevent and withdataandevents i dont see why deepwithdataandevents is necessary tho :xd
[04:55:01] <arc_> and select it
[04:55:52] <DFar> withdataandevents  clone event and data at (#datepickerPart)
[04:56:05] <hellyeah> arc_:  DFar  http://jsfiddle.net/ga2mmn23/9/
[04:56:17] <DFar> deepwithdataandevent  clone event and data at (#datepickerPart && .updatebutton) ?
[04:56:32] <Mark____> hm
[04:56:35] <hellyeah> aha
[04:56:36] <hellyeah> ic
[04:56:47] <Mark____> so what are you coding for right now hellyeah?
[04:56:53] <hellyeah> withdataandevent clone html markup
[04:57:04] <Mark____> i donâ€™t even know what thatis
[04:57:09] <hellyeah> deepwithdataandevents will clone content and events
[04:57:15] <hellyeah> is that true DFar
[04:57:34] <DFar> don't know, i just learn there are parameter to clone :D
[04:57:42] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[04:57:49] <DFar> but, it works now
[04:57:53] <hellyeah> Mark____:  can i show you after launch?
[04:57:57] <hellyeah> DFar:  yes
[04:57:59] <hellyeah> thanks
[04:58:25] <hellyeah> i will be back
[04:59:09] <DFar> Thanks you, I've learn something very interesting
[05:03:37] <Hollusionist> i can disable a uiTab by giving the class -ui-state-disabled to the li but somehow it does not work if i do that BEFORE initializing uiTab
[05:03:48] <Hollusionist> is there anoher way to do this?
[05:04:02] <Mark____> are you using the jquery ui tab?
[05:04:06] <Hollusionist> yes
[05:04:18] <Mark____> well, the thing is that
[05:04:36] <Mark____> well, havenâ€™t you already tried giving the class name?
[05:04:46] <Hollusionist> uiTab does not seem to check he li state on init
[05:04:51] <Mark____> hmm
[05:05:06] <Hollusionist> i can give the class after init, then it works
[05:05:13] <Mark____> the easiest thing would be putting your scrips all the way down to the last element of the body
[05:05:16] <Mark____> yeah
[05:05:24] <Mark____> that would work.
[05:05:27] <Hollusionist> seems like uiTab overrides all class setings on init
[05:05:37] <Mark____> im using the jquery ui tab myself
[05:05:38] <Hollusionist> wish i could just set it via html ;)
[05:05:44] <Mark____> whatâ€™s your purpose of using the tabs?
[05:06:12] <Hollusionist> standard usage. switching site content
[05:06:17] <Mark____> i see.
[05:06:29] <Mark____> im using the one that is draggable and closable.
[05:06:35] <Mark____> like a chrome tabs
[05:06:51] <Hollusionist> like browser tabs, i see
[05:07:14] <Mark____> yeah. i find them useful. http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[05:07:23] <Mark____> it opens up a tab when i click on the menu.
[05:09:19] <DFar> Hollusionist : Have you tried to refresh() uiTab ?
[05:09:35] <DFar> .tabs( "refresh" ) my bad
[05:09:52] <Hollusionist> i apply the class .ui-state-disabled to the li before doing .tabs()
[05:10:09] <Hollusionist> seems like its only possible the other way around
[05:11:06] <Mark____> hellyeah where are you
[05:11:24] <DFar> Hollusionist : or read each tab class and .tabs( "disable", 1 ); ?
[05:12:28] <DFar> (but Mark____ 's method seems to be a better way)
[05:13:01] <Twirl> anyone knows how to modify dropzone.js to allow CORS ? man this looks complicated and i can't add the headers pre-flight in nginx because it breaks my website
[05:24:40] <Uhkis> Twirl: you can't allow cors from client side
[05:25:00] <Twirl> Uhkis: yes i know but is there a workaround or something
[05:25:12] <Uhkis> Twirl: no
[05:26:06] <Uhkis> well, if there is, it's a security exploit and should be fixed
[05:27:25] <Twirl> Uhkis: why is it a security exploit?
[05:27:37] <Twirl> it would allow torjans to display ads and shit?
[05:28:12] <arc_> the classic example is
[05:28:13] <Twirl> writing adware is so complicated idk how they do it
[05:28:22] <arc_> imagine if someone could load gmail.com in an iframe and interact with it
[05:28:28] <arc_> that would be your gmail
[05:28:34] <arc_> and they can do whatever they want
[05:29:01] <Twirl> in their website
[05:29:04] <Twirl> ?
[05:29:16] <Twirl> because i'm not going into sites with adware
[05:29:33] <Twirl> that would be my fault, i don't go into dangerous neighborhoods
[05:29:47] <Twirl> adware/w/e
[05:29:53] <arc_> that is an explanation for why cors must be enabled server-side
[05:31:04] <ankakusu> "find" traversal operation starts with descendants. But I want to start the search from the element itself. Which JQuery function should I use?
[05:31:24] <Uhkis> Twirl: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy for more info
[05:32:39] <Twirl> Uhkis: man this is going to be a huge problem i think
[05:33:07] <Twirl> Uhkis: if i need to share profile pictures over subdomains where the fuck do i put them?
[05:33:44] <Twirl> this can't be so fucking stupid man, if i can load an image or link it from anywhere why i can't load it with javascript
[05:34:37] <Twirl> it's probably drpozone.js fault
[05:35:22] <arc_> what issue is causing you to think you need to enable cors
[05:36:11] <Twirl> when the site loads, the dropzone.js script loads images from the server and displays it as thumbs, it's throwing an error because they are in a different subdomain
[05:36:27] <Twirl> as in sub.site.com and dom.site.com
[05:37:17] <Twirl> https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/blob/master/dist/dropzone.js#L1673
[05:37:19] <Twirl> right there
[05:38:04] <Twirl> having the script / backend making a duplicate of each image for each subdomain would be stupid and really hard and annoying to program
[05:39:27] <Twirl> please man there has to be something i can do?
[05:40:46] <Twirl> or any workarounds / solution ?
[05:40:55] <arc_> no there is no workaround. the only thing you can do is enable cors
[05:41:38] <arc_> if doing so breaks your website then you'll have to figure out why that is
[05:41:39] <Twirl> arc_: that only fixes half the problem and i did enable cors but it breaks the website
[05:41:49] <Twirl> well that only fixes half the problem anyway
[05:41:54] <arc_> what do you mean
[05:41:57] <Twirl> i need to also fix the script somehow?
[05:42:27] <BarnaSza1ai> hi
[05:42:44] <BarnaSza1ai> how to collect data into an array in a jquery .each() loop?
[05:43:07] <BarnaSza1ai> inside each script cant see an outer array
[05:44:33] <arc_> did you define the array by saying "var array = [];"
[05:44:46] <BarnaSza1ai> of course
[05:44:53] <arc_> try without var
[05:45:09] <BarnaSza1ai> global variable? hm isnt that no good?
[05:45:20] <arc_> i mean ... you want to be able to access it
[05:46:22] <BarnaSza1ai> yes
[05:47:41] <BarnaSza1ai> ahh push worked
[05:49:04] <BarnaSza1ai> thx anyway
[05:56:57] <ankakusu> "find" traversal operation starts with descendants. But I want to start the search from the element itself. Which JQuery function should I use?

[06:10:30] <Duikb00t> it seems to override everything from my html makrup when I just attach it in a wrapper div
[06:14:02] <decx> use the static map api if you just want it as a background
[06:17:49] <Duikb00t> oh
[06:17:54] <Duikb00t> dam  i just found it iwith the normal api
[06:48:18] <BarnaSza1ai> any idea why I cant post an input value with php, when a jquery ui spinner effect is added to it?
[06:48:45] <BarnaSza1ai> when I remove the spinner effect all input fields are posted well
[06:49:15] <mrk> show us code
[06:49:51] <mrk> how are you validating your post?
[06:50:00] <mrk> and how do you send it?
[06:50:48] <BarnaSza1ai> currently no validation yet and Laravel framework sends the form
[06:51:58] <BarnaSza1ai> the form is:
[06:51:59] <hellyeah> can i ask about cloe()

[06:52:28] <BarnaSza1ai> the count_xx input fields are spinners
[06:52:30] <hellyeah> there is deepWithDataAndEvents and WithDataAndEvents that accept bool value
[06:52:54] <hellyeah> what is the difference between them?
[06:53:36] <mrk> and have that classes all time? at start also?
[06:54:12] <BarnaSza1ai> yes spinner set after the page loads
[06:56:34] <BarnaSza1ai> mrk: basically it shouldnt be a problem right?
[06:56:59] <BarnaSza1ai> posting an input field with php which has spinner effect on it
[06:57:56] <mrk> BarnaSza1ai: i dont know
[06:58:04] <mrk> but you can try put a div wrapper
[06:58:18] <BarnaSza1ai> around input field?
[06:58:29] <mrk> yes

[08:35:43] <decx> you get it how you would get any other attribute
[08:37:10] <awkwardCough> hellyeah: it doesn't look like you have anything happening when you click on the input box... so nothing is happening because you are not listening for anything.
[08:38:04] <hellyeah> when i calle datePickers function inside createInstance function that worked. But what i want is too call datePickers outside is there a way?

[08:59:59] <Duikb00t> Argh!
[09:15:36] <decx> what happened to the guy who wanted their object flattened
[09:19:58] <blinky_> Hi guys, using this code I am able to totgle a sub menu but it will leave the first submenu open when you click the second one, how would I get the first to close when the second it clicked? - http://pastie.org/10738525
[09:22:05] <alexwaters> I have two custom events - change and slideStop. Is there an easy easy way for me to nest events? I need to trigger a function on slideStop but only if a change event has occurred.
[09:22:10] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:22:19] <alexwaters> i suppose I could set a variable, but I was curious if there was another way
[09:22:21] <jomofcw> How can I know when the width of an element change, please ?
[09:23:10] <jomofcw> Without any Timeout trick, please.
[09:26:33] <Xatenev> jomofcw: what element?
[09:28:33] <decx> an elements width changes when you resize the browserwindow so use that event, if you actually resize an element for example with jqui then you already have resize events ready
[09:28:39] <decx> so what's the problem really
[09:32:04] <jomofcw> Xatenev hello, a UL in my example.
[09:32:19] <Xatenev> jomofcw: like decx said.
[09:32:53] <Xatenev> if your UL changes width cause some JS changes it - forget the event part and just do it straight in the JS that changes the width.
[09:33:43] <jomofcw> decx OK sorry haven't seen your solution ^^ So i'm already doing it well, I was just asking my self if there's a better way to do it. Is that correct : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6a08509514a1afc282f6
[09:35:04] <taplar> huh?
[09:35:23] <taplar> on window resize your triggering a new event on window that then does something?
[09:36:40] <jomofcw> taplar yup ^^.
[09:36:44] <taplar> y?
[09:46:17] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jem859yc/
[09:47:01] <taplar> it's typically more efficient to not create unneeded events to drive your logic
[09:48:28] <jomofcw> taplar OK.
[09:53:11] <Pasha> hi there
[09:53:52] <Guest48170> Ive dl and use 2.2.1 but I can't find any themes for this version
[09:54:15] <Guest48170> should I use 1.x Instead?
[09:54:28] <Guest48170> or are there themes for 2.2?
[09:55:04] <taplar> jQuery 2.2.1?
[09:55:16] <Guest48170> yes
[09:55:40] <taplar> from what i can tell it looks like the latest verson of jquery up works with 1.6+ as per their homepage
[09:55:46] <taplar> *jquery ui
[09:56:59] <taplar> except for the beta jquery ui themes, which appear to require 1.7+
[09:56:59] <Guest48170> So I can just use a 1.9 theme good to know
[09:57:46] <taplar> and your aware that the 1.x and the 2.x are ruffly the same, only difference is browser support, yes?
[09:57:56] <Guest48170> oh ok
[09:58:15] <Guest48170> maybe Ill switch to 1.9 later then4
[09:58:25] <Guest48170> first time using jq
[09:58:35] <taplar> 2.x doesn't have support for older IE versions.  if that is a concern you should use 1.x
[09:59:02] <taplar> or if your just not sure, use 1.x ;)
[09:59:07] <Guest48170> win7 still used IE 8 right?
[09:59:18] <taplar> not sure, i don't use it at home
[09:59:24] <Guest48170> uses
[09:59:26] <taplar> pretty sure you can upgrade beyond that for win7
[10:00:50] <Guest48170> Is 1.9 beta?
[10:01:32] <Guest48170> From the downloads 1.12.1 seems to be stable
[10:01:48] <Guest48170> bit confusing
[10:02:48] <Guest48170> why do I get a blog post if I want do download JQ 1.9?
[10:03:51] <shoky> Guest48170 win7 does not use ie8.
[10:04:26] <shoky> and yeah jquery 1.12.1 is stable, no need for 1.9
[10:05:10] <Guest48170> Well I want to use the themes though
[10:05:35] <Guest48170> had to use google for the 1.9 download...
[10:06:18] <shoky> themes is jquery-ui, not jquery
[10:06:34] <Guest48170> oh ok
[10:06:48] <Guest48170> well Ill try 1.9 first though
[10:07:07] <Guest48170> can I use a 1.9.2 theme with 1.9.1?
[10:07:09] <taplar> sorry stepped away
[10:07:48] <shoky> jquery-ui is at 1.11.4
[10:07:52] <shoky> with themes..
[10:08:20] <Guest48170> but there is http://jqueryui.com/download/#!version=1.9.2
[10:08:28] <shoky> so?
[10:08:31] <shoky> that's an old version
[10:08:46] <shoky> legacy, as the page says
[10:08:48] <decx> says right on the page "legacy" ^^
[10:08:51] <rnelson0> Hi, I have a set of tabs within tabs. I want some text inside one of the 2nd set of tabs to be a link to another tab in that 2nd level. Is there an easy way to do that?
[10:09:10] <decx> you have to incept your tab
[10:09:33] <rnelson0> I see SO entries like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2925567/jquery-tab-link-to-another-tab-from-content-within-a-tab but that is confusing to me and looks to only work for the top level set of tabs.
[10:09:47] <Guest48170> that is confusing since when is 1.9 older than 1.1 ....
[10:09:56] <decx> it's actually 1.11
[10:10:25] <rnelson0> decx: how can I do that then?
[10:10:55] <decx> you still do tabs('select', index) just over several layers
[10:11:29] <decx> let's assume tab 1 has 2 tabs in it, the link in the undetab would just select another tab on the first level
[10:11:35] <shoky> it's "active"  now
[10:11:55] <rnelson0> decx: I need to go from tab 3:5 to tab 3:3 for instance
[10:12:14] <decx> interesting
[10:12:37] <shoky> tabs('active', index)
[10:12:45] <rnelson0> and yeah, I can only seem to go from 3:5 to 3 or 1, but not 3:1
[10:12:46] <decx> is it active?
[10:13:03] <decx> fiddle up
[10:13:20] <shoky> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-active
[10:13:30] <decx> what was select then
[10:13:31] <decx> ^^
[10:13:42] <shoky> same thing, just old version, i think
[10:13:47] <decx> aah
[10:15:06] <shoky> er sorry so that'd be tabs('option', 'active', index)
[10:15:21] <shoky> rnelson0 ^
[10:16:14] <jimi_> I am serializing a form and submitting it through an XHR request. like data = form.serlializeArray() which is working fine, but i am trying to add another param to the array which holds a multi-dimensional array, and when it comes across to the server it comes as the string literal [object object] etc, how should i handle the multi-dimensional array? does it need to be serialized also after pushing it into the array?
[10:16:24] <rnelson0> shoky: so in my .js something like this? $('#anchor').click(function(){ $('#sysadmin_tabs').tabs('option', 'active',2) });
[10:16:57] <rnelson0> (based on that SO link, if there's a better way I'm all eyes)
[10:18:13] <rnelson0> decx: I tried to set up a fiddle but no joy. it's a dynamically created php page that's truly horrid underneath.
[10:18:31] <decx> shouldnt stop you from generalizing the concept
[10:20:00] <rnelson0> when i hit run i got one word on the page and no tabs
[10:25:18] <Guest48170> does JQ UI 1.12 work with 1.9.1?
[10:25:38] <Guest48170> it kinda isn't working
[10:26:17] <taplar> it says 1.7, but it is beta
[10:26:25] <taplar> 1.7+
[10:26:52] <rnelson0> decx: shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/hpw7g2pg/1/
[10:27:09] <rnelson0> sysadmin -> user list, how do I get that link to go to the user management tab?
[10:27:16] <Guest48170> I tried many different ones but everything looks like before
[10:28:17] <shoky> rnelson0: mm you don't have any element with id "anchor" tho
[10:30:47] <decx> rnelson0: not exactly bulletproof but a start https://jsfiddle.net/decx/kobpe0hd/
[10:34:54] <rnelson0> shoky: ah I tried it in /2 with #user_management in the link and the js
[10:35:44] <shoky> rnelson0: to answer your question tho - https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hpw7g2pg/3/
[10:37:05] <rnelson0> shoky: decx: thanks, the href vs id/class was confusing me.
[10:37:18] <rnelson0> is there a difference or preference between id and class?
[10:37:32] <decx> id has to be unique
[10:37:44] <decx> and can be used to move to an element per hash even without js
[10:38:29] <rnelson0> ah so if I had 10 links on that tab, they could all have the same class, or have unique ids?
[10:39:18] <decx> they'd have the tablink class
[10:39:41] <decx> i only used the hash because it's in the jquery ui demos, you can use data attributes or whatever you like
[10:40:13] <decx> the gist of it, be able to identify your nested tabs
[10:41:03] <decx> i use eq here because it is known that those are the only tabs on that page
[10:41:19] <decx> may vary in prod ^^
[10:56:52] <zagaza> not sure where to ask this but.. can someone help me figure out why my video is autoplaying/working on desktop? but if you view it on a mobile it's not working.. it's not even working if you change user agent to mobile in chrome  http://hfrwlmnufd.cluster002.ovh.net/single-video-test/
[11:01:11] <decx> ask vimeo
[11:01:43] <decx> oh somebody already did
[11:01:51] <decx>  Why can't I loop or autoplay my videos on mobile devices? These functions are restricted on most mobile platforms and are out of our control. Sorry!
[11:02:10] <decx> so ask browservendors i guess ^^

[11:18:41] <decx> apart from looking ugly that should work
[11:34:33] <devslash> I'm using the jQuery bootbox to display a nice looking alert message. Is there a way in jquery to wait until the first element has been closed before showing the next one
[11:35:30] <robertmaxrees> you'd probably have to bind an event listener and do that yourself.
[11:35:46] <robertmaxrees> or you could switch to using something like bootstrap-tour instead.
[11:36:04] <rnelson0> decx: shoky: trying to use either of yours in jsfiddle works fine. In prod, not so much. How can I get started on debugging the class/id or the function
[11:37:37] <devslash> why is it that nothing in jquery can be modal ?
[11:37:51] <robertmaxrees> devslash huh?
[11:38:10] <newbie> hi i am new to JavaScript and i am trying to do a calculation if some one  add a number multiply by .0348 but only if a world is selected can any one help me
[11:38:22] <devslash> you cannot create a modal dialog that stops execution until you click ok
[11:38:24] <robertmaxrees> newbie lots of people can help you.
[11:38:35] <robertmaxrees> devslash you don't want to "stop execution" ever anyway >.>
[11:39:05] <newbie> its for a pdf form i am working on
[11:39:15] <robertmaxrees> newbie that's fine - show us your code
[11:39:17] <robertmaxrees> use jsfiddle.
[11:40:22] <newbie> this is where i got:   var v1 = +getfield("QTY1").value event.value=v1*.3048;
[11:41:22] <robertmaxrees> newbie https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7grh8ucr/ use this site.
[11:41:28] <robertmaxrees> don't put code int he hannel :)
[11:42:06] <robertmaxrees> also, PDFs are a little different from webpages, so it's hard to help.
[11:42:39] <newbie> ok
[11:46:57] <newbie> this is a screen shot of the form http://postimg.org/image/tgyy04p31
[11:47:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, screenshots don't help.
[11:47:14] <robertmaxrees> there's literally nothing i can do with that :)
[11:47:44] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you maybe need to do a basic JS tutorial and dive into the docs for scripting PDFs.
[11:48:35] <newbie> ok
[11:48:48] <newbie> Thank you
[11:57:52] <ezerf> hi to check that a string begins like another ? I try to do something like that : https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_5R-NtKnC8/maxresdefault.jpg :)

[12:00:36] <ezerf> thank you
[12:38:55] <islalobo> I'm trying to pass 'webUserProfileId' variable: http://kopy.io/vJSPc
[12:39:45] <taplar> you have it as a var in two places i see
[12:39:53] <taplar> and callbacks don't really return
[12:41:00] <islalobo> callbacks don't really return?
[12:41:03] <taplar> your also binding a click handler inside a click handler
[12:41:07] <taplar> no, they don't
[12:41:15] <taplar> they're asynchronous methods
[12:41:22] <taplar> there's no where to return to
[12:41:38] <taplar> at least in regards to ajax callbacks
[12:41:59] <islalobo> If I moved it?
[12:42:26] <islalobo> The first click brings up a modal and there are a number of options inside the modal to 'click'
[12:42:26] <taplar> if you took the var off of the inner element and let it use the outer one, it would be available at a larger scope
[12:42:39] <taplar> however you still have the issue of binding a click handler in a click handler
[12:42:49] <taplar> which can result in multiple bindings of the same logic
[12:43:41] <islalobo> inner element? for click in click binding, see my reasoning above
[12:43:53] <taplar> see my reasoning why it's bad
[12:44:08] <islalobo> Yeah, but how else can I accomplish what I need?
[12:44:20] <taplar> only bind once, either directly or with a delegate
[12:45:18] <islalobo> What exactly are you referring to when you say bind? Just my use of .on()
[12:45:35] <taplar> ln 44
[12:46:21] <islalobo> Yes, is there an issue with user .click() rather than .on()?
[12:46:34] <robertBusy> .click() is just using .on() under the hood.
[12:46:36] <taplar> no, click is a wrapper for on now days
[12:46:44] <taplar> it's an issue with the multiple bindings, as i've said
[12:47:38] <islalobo> taplar your help allowed me to access that var webUserProfile at a larger scope, many many many thanks@
[12:47:48] <taplar> cool
[12:48:03] <islalobo> But I'm still not certain how I can accomplish what I need if I can't use .on() or .click() in my modal
[12:48:16] <taplar> are you familiar with delegates?
[12:48:23] <robertBusy> he's saying oyu need to use .on() and make a delegated listener.
[12:49:48] <taplar> http://taplar.com/jquery/#delegateEventBinding
[12:50:15] <robertBusy> taplar have you ever considered helping clarify the learning center articles?
[12:50:28] <taplar> not really
[12:51:02] <taplar> didn't know if how i word things might be seen as verbose, the bad kind
[12:51:17] <robertBusy> they'd probably appreciate a refresh on them.
[12:51:24] <islalobo> taplar general idea: http://kopy.io/3NUrt
[12:51:52] <taplar> islalobo: yep
[12:51:58] <islalobo> Thanks again!
[12:52:03] <islalobo> taplar++
[12:52:04] <taplar> the idea is to bind on something that already exists
[12:52:13] <robertBusy> an ancestor that already exists.,
[12:52:14] <taplar> then it doesn't matter when the children are created
[12:54:34] <ajpiano> taplar confirming what robertBusy said, would be awesome if you contributed, don't worry about being too verbose or anything... :)
[12:54:44] <robertBusy> ajpiano++
[12:54:52] * taplar sings *under pressure*
[12:59:42] <robertBusy> if they trusted me to write the original CoC, you'll be fine ;)
[13:00:02] <taplar> heh
[13:04:33] <islalobo> So, this should put something in my console but it isnt':http://kopy.io/zSzFi
[13:04:48] <robertBusy> does MedicationModalLink exist on pageload?
[13:05:19] <islalobo> Yeah yah, it's there
[13:05:32] <robertBusy> is there only one #MedicationModalLink on the page?
[13:05:48] <islalobo> That might be it actually
[13:06:14] <taplar> console.log($('[id="MedicationModalLink"]').length);
[13:06:19] <robertBusy> ^
[13:06:34] <taplar> btw, that's just for debugging.  don't start using that, :P
[13:06:55] <robertBusy> ^^^^^
[13:07:22] <islalobo> Prior to .on() ?
[13:07:28] <robertBusy> sure.
[13:07:34] <taplar> or just in your console
[13:08:11] <islalobo> I get 1
[13:08:25] <taplar> ok, is the link your clicking a child of that element?
[13:08:45] <islalobo> Should it be a child?
[13:08:52] <robertBusy> yes.
[13:08:54] <robertBusy> it has to be.
[13:09:05] <robertBusy> the idea is that the event bubbles up through the document.
[13:09:21] <robertBusy> so you're binding to a parent element, listening for events that emit from children.
[13:09:50] <islalobo> It's an <li><a></a><li>
[13:09:58] <robertBusy> that doesn't change anything.
[13:09:59] <robertBusy> :)
[13:10:05] <islalobo> But there aren't really children
[13:10:11] <robertBusy> huh?
[13:10:11] <taplar> a is a child of li
[13:10:22] <robertBusy> "descendents" is a better way to put it i guess.
[13:11:02] <islalobo> Oh that works!
[13:11:34] <islalobo> taplar++
[13:11:39] <islalobo> robertBusy++
[13:12:57] <islalobo> To check each var elem: elem.attr('.add-medication')
[13:13:13] <taplar> hmm?
[13:13:18] <robertBusy> huh?
[13:13:28] <robertBusy> you mean you want to see if it has a class?
[13:13:33] <taplar> you could put that on the child filter
[13:13:36] <taplar> if you only want those
[13:13:45] <islalobo> if(elem.attr('.add-medication')) (there will be several)
[13:13:52] <robertBusy> uh.
[13:14:01] <taplar> 'click', '.add-medication', function() { ...
[13:14:15] <robertBusy> that's looking for an attribute called .add-medication="somevalue"
[13:14:25] <robertBusy> just pass it as the child selector.
[13:14:54] <islalobo> But I'll end up binding to several instances again, no?
[13:14:58] <robertBusy> no.
[13:15:01] <taplar> nope, that's just the filter
[13:15:04] <robertBusy> the important part is the $()
[13:15:26] <robertBusy> $('this is what you're binding to').on('event', 'this is basically like a filder', function() {});
[13:17:29] <islalobo> I don't see clearly how this helps with the issue, that I need users to click things in a modal
[13:17:51] <robertBusy> using a delegated listener means you're only binding once instead of multiple times.
[13:17:58] <robertBusy> you call it once, instead of every time you add something.
[13:18:23] <islalobo> The other instances aren't <li>
[13:18:27] <islalobo> Does that mattter?
[13:18:42] <robertBusy> will that selector still match?
[13:18:46] <robertBusy> the .add-medication ?
[13:18:52] <robertBusy> the things you care about i mean.
[13:19:14] <islalobo> No, it changes (they are different the original snippet)
[13:19:32] <robertBusy> then pass the different selectors you care about in that second arg.
[13:19:50] <islalobo> all of them? I can pass mutliple?
[13:19:57] <robertBusy> .on('event', '.selector1, .someotherclass, .youcaneven .selectchildren', function() {});
[13:19:58] <robertBusy> yep.
[13:19:59] <taplar> 'one, two, three, ...'
[13:20:05] <robertBusy> it takes a selector.
[13:20:07] <islalobo> Oh, nice
[13:20:07] <robertBusy> just like $()
[13:20:34] <taplar> i'm curious though, the different selectors, your performing the same logic?
[13:20:48] <islalobo> Is this when I would use if conditionals, to determine what happens?
[13:20:59] <robertBusy> in that case, use different handlers.
[13:26:00] <islalobo> Using different handlers I can't access the var http://kopy.io/qfo9r
[13:26:34] <robertBusy> what var?
[13:26:42] <islalobo> webUserProfileId
[13:26:50] <taplar> move the var outside of the binding
[13:27:06] <taplar> you can set it inside, but declare the var outside
[13:27:32] <taplar> so it's scope is not limited to a single handler
[13:27:42] <islalobo> Amazing
[13:27:47] <robertBusy> what is this var for?
[13:28:09] <islalobo> It's a user variable I need to make a few calls (activate, deactivate, optin to comms etc)
[13:28:43] <robertBusy> are those calls made when you click on things?
[13:29:16] <robertBusy> just making sure you should be like passing these values as args to functions or something instead.
[13:29:32] <islalobo> Yeah, one of the calls is yes/no (one of the mulitple clicks I was binding to). The yes/no use that Id to check user optin status or to opt the user in
[13:30:51] <tomasm-> is it possible to use ajax requests to process responses that need to send content (<script> tags) periodically with an on-going output buffer rather than the remote end being closed? I have an upload that could take several minutes and I wanted to respond with a javascript call to updating a progress bar.... I know I can do it if I post to an iframe but not sure if it's doable with $.post(), since the success callback may be called o
[13:30:51] <tomasm-> nly at the end?
[13:31:13] <robertBusy> tomasm- what?
[13:31:17] <robertBusy> are you trying to have a progressbar?
[13:31:37] <tomasm-> robertBusy, yes, implementing a progress bar with a large file upload
[13:31:44] <robertBusy> then why not use the progress api?
[13:32:00] <robertBusy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20095002/how-to-show-progress-bar-while-loading-using-ajax
[13:32:15] <robertBusy> you don't respond using script tags, you use the progress evemt
[13:32:19] <robertBusy> *event
[13:33:10] <tomasm-> because I know not of it?
[13:33:25] <robertBusy> now you do :)
[13:35:50] <tomasm-> robertBusy, hmmmm, does that work in IE?  The referenced post is from 2010 and says it's not, so I'd imagine something works by now.
[13:36:01] <robertBusy> just pointing you in a direction :)
[13:37:10] <robertBusy> http://filedropjs.org/#progress
[13:37:19] <robertBusy> lots of choices out there.
[13:39:25] <tomasm-> hmmm, well the issue isn't the file is large.... just that it takes a long time to get results (lots of db queries). so the feedback needs to be provided by the backend, knowing how far along the process is in total.
[13:40:08] <robertBusy> so you're not doing a file upload?  hrmmm.
[13:40:16] <robertBusy> you're going to have a hard time finding something.
[13:40:24] <taplar> from a rest standpoint one approach would be for the endpoint to return a url in the header or some where
[13:40:31] <tomasm-> yes I am doing a file upload, but it's usually very small. the meat is in the processing of the file.
[13:40:34] <taplar> then you'd periodically hit that url to get the percentage
[13:41:19] <robertBusy> http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/ you couple probably adapt this and emit things from your server.
[13:41:30] <robertBusy> though that might not help.
[13:42:13] <tomasm-> how I have it now is the form posts to an iframe,  and the output buffer is turned off in PHP and returns a script tag to update the progress bar periodically... it works except I need a way to cancel the processing, close the progress bar, re-upload, etc.
[13:42:46] <taplar> hmm, i'm not familiar how in php you would cancel such a thing
[13:42:56] <robertBusy> yeah something here seems way funky.
[13:42:57] <taplar> might be   a question for those guys
[13:43:10] <robertBusy> and sending back script tags seems a little off, too.  i'd start by looking at the cancel.
[13:43:38] <tomasm-> well, i  would abort the ajax request since the response isn't complete. but.... I dont know how to provide upload feedback in the meantime.
[13:43:57] <taplar> i thought you said the request completed, but was just processing server side?
[13:43:59] <islalobo> Trying to pass the var optInTypes
[13:44:00] <islalobo> http://kopy.io/fxVWA
[13:44:27] <robertBusy> islalobo you don't pass it.
[13:44:30] <robertBusy> it's already there.
[13:44:32] <tomasm-> ok i guess the response is what takes a long time. not sure if ajax can cancel that.
[13:44:36] <robertBusy> isaacdurazo pload, etc.
[13:44:36] <robertBusy> [2016:02:26:10:42:47] <taplar> hmm, i'm not famil
[13:44:38] <robertBusy> woops
[13:44:51] <robertBusy> islalobo  $('#AddRefillReminderYes').on('click', function(optInTypes) { - you're just naming the event object there.
[13:44:57] <robertBusy> you just happen to be calling it optInTypes.
[13:45:03] <islalobo> Hrm, but when I try to print it in the console after the $('#AddRefillReminderYes').on('click') it's comes up as null
[13:45:28] <islalobo> (if I remove it from function())
[13:45:37] <robertBusy> getUserOptin(webUserProfileId); is this doing what you think it is?
[13:45:45] <robertBusy> protip: it's no.
[13:45:47] <robertBusy> *not
[13:45:50] <islalobo> It gets me the webUserProfileId
[13:46:05] <robertBusy> right, but optInTypes = getUserOptin(webUserProfileId); isn't setting that value to the ID
[13:46:31] <robertBusy> getUserOptin() doesn't return anything, but you can't return anything from it other than a deferred anyway.
[13:46:56] <islalobo> Hrm, right. I got to re-read this
[13:47:28] <robertBusy> islalobo you're dealing with ajax - when you call the ajax function, it hands a request off to the browser, but the JS doesn't stop executing - that'd lock the browser up.
[13:47:48] <robertBusy> you could (and probably should!) use deferreds here depending on what you really want to accomplishj
[13:47:57] <tomasm-> okay well then maybe what I need is a way to detect that the user clicks on the browser stop button... and close the progress bar after that...  I dont think relying on a "ping" method from the server (to keep the progress bar open) would be reliable.
[13:48:38] <taplar> iirc one of the jquery upload plugins has cancel logic built in
[13:48:48] <robertBusy> it's not the upload though,.
[13:48:53] <robertBusy> it's the server processing stuff.
[13:49:14] <taplar> hmm
[13:50:19] <tomasm-> I can just cancel the browser with it's stop button or escape, just that the progress bar still shows on the screen and appears to stall.
[13:50:37] <islalobo> robertBusy: deferred??
[13:51:16] <robertBusy> http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/
[13:52:35] <islalobo> So I can't return optinTypes from that function?
[13:53:01] <taplar> what if the request took 15 seconds?
[13:53:10] <robertBusy> islalobo nope.  you can return the ajax call itself, which whill resolve or reject with that value, but you can't just return the value.
[13:57:31] <taplar> just from reading this snipplet, you may want to disable 'AddRefillReminderYes' while the ajax is running
[13:57:59] <taplar> reenable it after the ajax call returns the value that that handler needs
[13:58:26] <taplar> otherwise you kinda have a race condition
[13:58:38] <jak2000> hi all

[13:59:17] <jak2000> how to execute this line: window.open("ServletImpEtTar2?itarimaid=" + wIdMaster, "_blank");   after 15 seconds ?
[13:59:26] <robertBusy> use setTimeout
[14:12:19] <ABM_Dan> Considering that nowadays we can have input elements that are bound to a form that is not wrapping them, is there a jquery method that identifies the form(s) an input is tied to without me having to poll for .attr('form') >
[14:12:24] <ABM_Dan> s/>/?
[14:12:24] <b-ot> Correction, <ABM_Dan> Considering that nowadays we can have input elements that are bound to a form that is not wrapping them, is there a jquery method that identifies the form(s) an input is tied to without me having to poll for .attr('form') ?
[14:12:50] <ABM_Dan> Whoa. we have a thing that does s/ stuff.
[14:12:54] <robertBusy> huh?
[14:13:02] <robertBusy> mind clarifying what you mean?
[14:13:49] <ABM_Dan> Say I have <form id="one" /><input id="two" form="one"/> I'd like to get $('#one') somehow starting from $('#two');
[14:14:13] <ABM_Dan> closest('form') would fail in that situation.
[14:14:44] <robertBusy> where are you seeing references to that attribute?
[14:14:49] <robertBusy> ah nvm.
[14:14:59] <ABM_Dan> in w3 documents?
[14:15:11] <taplar> that's a good question
[14:15:12] <robertBusy> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input also specifies.
[14:15:15] <islalobo> What is the best way to check whether $webUserProfileOptInTypes['webUserProfileOptInTypes']['value'] vs $webUserProfileOptInTypes['webUserProfileOptInTypes'][0]['value'] is set in jquery?
[14:15:18] <ABM_Dan> There too.
[14:15:44] <mmmveggies> .attr('autocomplete', false) will completely remove the attribute from the DOM element, right?
[14:15:47] <robertBusy> ABM_Dan you'll probably have to manually select it - var myFormID = $someInput.prop('form')
[14:15:53] <robertBusy> mmmveggies use .prop() instead.
[14:16:22] <mmmveggies> so .prop('autocomplete', false) will completely remove the property from the DOM element right
[14:16:38] <robertBusy> that's a weird question - are you trying to deactivate autocomplete?
[14:17:11] <mmmveggies> no, it's already autocomplete=false
[14:17:17] <mmmveggies> or autocomplete="off" rather
[14:17:18] <robertBusy> aaaah - ABM_Dan https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/La5wtmLu/
[14:17:23] <robertBusy> the prop IS the form itself.
[14:17:36] <robertBusy> mmmveggies so then why are you trying to remove that property?
[14:17:44] <mmmveggies> I want to just remove that whole bit from the element so that the input can behave as it does defaultly
[14:18:00] <robertBusy> setting it to false with .prop() should work fine.
[14:18:06] <taplar> mmmveggies: autocomplete most likely has a destroy method
[14:18:27] <ABM_Dan> robertBusy: $('#mind').setBlown(True.getValue('bool'));
[14:18:36] <robertBusy> ABM_Dan ;)
[14:18:47] <mmmveggies> welllll it's a toggle. so .prop('autocomplete', myBool ? "off" : false)
[14:19:01] <robertBusy> mmmveggies you can just pass the bool
[14:19:18] <ABM_Dan> I do wish there was a $('[input]').getForm() method tho.
[14:19:29] <robertBusy> ABM_Dan submit a PR then ;)
[14:19:33] <ABM_Dan> It's like a one liner.
[14:19:45] <robertBusy> it's an OS project.
[14:20:03] <mmmveggies> robertBust so when myBool is true, autocomplete will be true then though, and when it's set to false, it will remove the property, which means it will still be autocompleting?
[14:20:35] <robertBusy> mmmveggies errr, autocommplete is much more complex than that.
[14:20:48] <robertBusy> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-autocomplete
[14:21:03] <robertBusy> you should check out removeProp() for your case.
[14:21:06] <robertBusy> https://api.jquery.com/removeProp/
[14:21:27] <ABM_Dan> I might get on that later.
[14:21:37] <jak2000> robertBusy: setTimeout(function(){ window.open("ServletImpEtTar2?itarimaid=" + wIdMaster, "_blank"); }, 3000);  ots correct?
[14:21:41] <robertBusy> ABM_Dan I might submit a github iss forst and see if that's what they want.
[14:21:51] <robertBusy> also: that wouldn't be a consistent method name.
[14:22:06] <robertBusy> jak2000 Did You Try That?â„¢
[14:22:10] <ABM_Dan> Yeah also whatever I end up writing is not gonna be as good.
[14:22:21] <robertBusy> ABM_Dan uh, they'll give you feedback to help.
[14:23:20] <mmmveggies> robertBusy, looks like I can switch between "on" and "off" then
[14:24:17] <robertBusy> mmmveggies you said you want to go back to the default though right?
[14:26:43] <mmmveggies> robertBusy I can actually go back to on, but you're right, it does make more sense to explicitly go back to default
[14:29:18] <mmmveggies> robertBusy Thanks :D

[14:50:07] <islalobo> It's in a for .each statement
[14:50:09] <taplar> { key1: value1, key2: value2 }
[14:50:37] <SmashingX> thanks taplar !
[14:50:43] <taplar> SmashingX: np
[14:51:01] <taplar> islalobo: and fwiw, your building an an array/object in javascript, not jquery, :P
[14:51:46] <mmmveggies> https://jsfiddle.net/z0rzpsc4/4/ @taplar @SmashingX lol
[14:56:12] <SmashingX> mmmveggies: but if they refresh the page it would reset the counter correct?
[14:57:08] <taplar> your going to have that issue regardless, unless you base your logic off of something else like possibly a set sessionStorage/localStorage variable
[14:57:51] <taplar> or fetching the lime left from the server
[14:58:15] <taplar> which would be more accurate as client clocks can be different/inaccurate
[14:58:37] <taplar> lol, lime=time
[15:02:45] <mmmveggies> that's why the variable is called downTime, cause you replace it with the actual downtime, mines just an illusion
[15:03:29] <islalobo> taplar: I'm trying this optInTypeId[key] = [value['optInTypeId']];
[15:04:05] <taplar> is optInTypeId already defined as an object and the same for value?
[15:04:11] <taplar> i need more context
[15:15:01] <islalobo1> taplar: http://kopy.io/Oa8aI
[15:16:00] <taplar> ok, that's fine then.  but your overlaying the variable every time, or actually your not preserving it.  it's scoped to the each method
[15:16:20] <taplar> fwiw, you'd be better off using map instead
[15:16:34] <islalobo1> taplar: I'm not sure how to map with js
[15:16:51] <islalobo1> Read some stuff online. But it's not really working for me
[15:17:13] <taplar> $.map( basicArray, function( elementInTheArray ){  return (something made from the elementInTheArray); });
[15:17:36] <taplar> that would return an array containing all the elements the callback returned
[15:18:10] <islalobo1> what's basicArray in that case?
[15:18:14] <taplar> mm, except your trying to do an object
[15:18:40] <islalobo1> No, an array is fine. In the end I just want to see if a particular id is in that array
[15:19:23] <islalobo1> Is basicArray 'webUserProfileOptInTypes['webUserProfileOptInTypes']' ie the array I'm doing the .each statement on?
[15:20:12] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/9bu3tsyn/
[15:20:19] <taplar> a basicArray is just a []
[15:20:26] <taplar> as opposed to a jquery collection
[15:22:46] <islalobo1> taplar that works
[15:22:55] <taplar> you get what it's doing?
[15:26:08] <taplar> also small side note, your if statement could just be: if (webUserProfileOptInTypes.webUserProfileOptInTypes.length)
[15:26:14] <taplar> non-zero is truthy
[15:27:35] <islalobo1> map is translating the items in the origianl array to a new array of items (taken from manual). so, webUserProfileOptInTypes['webUserProfileOptInTypes'][item] is mapped and you've indicated to use value[optintypeid]. and a new array is created
[15:27:44] <islalobo1> That is great
[15:27:51] <taplar> :)
[15:34:03] <islalobo1> taplar++
[15:38:41] <mmmveggies> (okay) taplas
[15:39:12] <taplar> no way, taplas is a douche
[15:56:54] <devslash> if I remove an element using remove() and inspect the source code is it normal to see the html code for the div still in the source ?
[15:57:26] <taplar> your changing the dom, not the source
[15:57:39] <bango2> devslash yes, view source is showing you what the source looked like on page load
[15:57:55] <devslash> I see
[15:58:00] <arc_> if you inspect and use elements tab, it will be gone
[15:58:06] <devslash> ok thanks
[17:33:40] <robertBusy> weeeee
[17:37:57] <taplar> lol
[18:34:09] <rnelson0> decx: shoky: thanks for the help today. I think the jquery we are using may be too old, I'll be back to it on Monday or Tuesday again.
[20:00:35] <papasmurf> HI
[20:00:47] <papasmurf> evertime i join one of these
[20:00:49] <papasmurf> no one is talking
[20:00:56] <papasmurf> :(
[20:01:11] <robertmaxrees> "one of these"?
[20:01:22] <robertmaxrees> you mean a channel?
[20:01:51] <papasmurf> no i mean a channel
[20:02:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:02:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:02:32] <robertmaxrees> they have their ups and downs.
[20:02:38] <robertmaxrees> this ones just kind of quiet right now.
[20:02:54] <papasmurf> ah.
[20:03:11] <robertmaxrees> kind of a funky time - lots of people aren't on right now, or they're just busy doing other things.
[20:03:28] * taplar is watching tv while lurking
[20:03:33] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:03:47] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i exit to go handle some difficult family stuff.  enjoy folks.
[20:04:01] <papasmurf> thanks talk to you later
[21:29:01] <bobdobbs> I'm trying do do something with the jQuery UI slider. I've set the value range from 5 to 15.
[21:29:15] <bobdobbs> However, when I move the slider, the values are wonky
[21:29:26] <bobdobbs> Like, the range goes something like this:
[21:29:46] <bobdobbs> 6, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... to 15
[21:29:54] <bobdobbs> http://staging.defensevids.com/
[21:30:11] <bobdobbs> have I broken maths?
[21:37:09] <bobdobbs> oh, I think I know what I did wrong
[21:46:12] <shoky> bobdobbs: use `ui.value`  instead of  $( ".lr-slider" ).slider( "option", "value" )
[21:57:58] <bobdobbs> shoky: thanks
[21:58:50] <bobdobbs> I think I spotted that at about the same time that you did. I just wasn't paying close enough attention to the code
[22:15:55] <evilbug> bobdobbs: yo.
[22:36:24] <cangelosx1> im trying to prevent a form from submitting:
[22:36:25] <cangelosx1>  $("body").on("submit", "#transaction-scan-form", function(e) {
[22:36:25] <cangelosx1>         e.preventDefault();
[22:36:30] <cangelosx1> however it still does
[22:40:20] <arc_> cangelosx1 return false instead of preventDefault()
[22:40:30] <cangelosx1> i tried both
[22:40:40] <cangelosx1> apparently delegated events aren't cancellable?
[22:41:08] <arc_> e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); e.stopImmediatePropagation();
[22:41:39] <arc_> i did not notice that it was delegated
[22:43:52] <cangelosx1> i found the problem
[22:44:11] <cangelosx1> return false; does the trick, however there's another delegated listener
[22:44:22] <cangelosx1> in another script
[22:44:50] <cangelosx1> im guessing whichever script loads first can cancel propagation
