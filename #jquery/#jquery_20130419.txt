[00:05:39] <andrewgearhart> howdy folks. I'm using datatables.net nice table tools built on jquery. I'm attempting to load ajax... (1) AND do a set of sorting dropdowns (2) ... per these examples: 1) http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/data_sources/ajax.html and 2) http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/multi_filter_select.html I'm loading the data successfully... but the select boxes aren't getting built. I'm sure I'm missing something sim
[00:05:47] <sl33k_> Cork: it sets only one option. other visible options have vanished when I added the line in each() function.
[00:06:35] <Cork> sl33k_: are you sure d1 contains an object?
[00:09:12] <sl33k_> Cork: pretty sure
[00:09:30] <Cork> what is Object.keys(data).length
[00:11:51] <granden> The HTML5 data-attributes. could I use them with jquery in all browsers that supports a certain version of jquery? I need to store an id and dunno how to do it best to access it from my jquery-code.
[00:12:36] <pats_Toms> when I am using jquery each is there any epic way how to check if element is first?
[00:14:27] <crawleyprint> pats_Toms: if you pass counter var to iterator function you can test if i == 0
[00:14:50] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:15:03] <seba4> if $("[id^='tab-']") searches for random  number at the end..
[00:15:18] <seba4> how to do it for tab-RANDOM-container ?
[00:15:25] <seba4> so it searches in the middle
[00:16:34] <sl33k_> Cork: 7
[00:16:50] <thomedy> im creating a custom jquery plugin.... just to show i can for my portfolio.... but i hav eread mdn on this one.... layerx should give e the position relative to the container the event takes place in
[00:17:08] <crawleyprint> pats_Toms: http://jsfiddle.net/jH2ve/
[00:17:12] <thomedy> but as i move my mmouse around... its 2x the position
[00:17:38] <pats_Toms> thanks crawleyprint
[00:17:55] <crawleyprint> your welcome pats_Toms
[00:18:31] <seba4> someone knows how to search for wildcard in between
[00:21:15] <sl33k_> Cork: any workaround would be very helpful and i would be grateful
[00:21:38] <webpro> just wondering: how to get that 10KB build of v2.0? I can "only" get it to 14KB when excluding all optional modules and gzip that minified build
[00:24:29] <sl33k_> Cork: I asked here https://forum.jquery.com/topic/dropdown-option-only-setting-selected-after-alert and got the same response
[00:29:02] <andrewgearhart> trying to figure out how to act on data loaded from an ajax call to populate a select box...
[00:35:18] <Catharz> andrewgearhart: are you trying to work on the data after the select box has been populated, or before?
[00:35:57] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: I'm populating the table using the ajax... then trying to create the filtering drop down boxes.
[00:36:06] <seba4> how u check if toggle is visible or not?
[00:37:49] <ravenzz> ?is @ seba4
[00:37:49] <b-ot> seba4: is
[00:37:49] <bot-t> seba4, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[00:38:47] <Catharz> andrewgearhart: might need a gist to understand what you're trying to do.
[00:39:59] <chinoto> is there an element that can exist after </body?>
[00:40:01] <sl33k_> could i get any help with this question? https://forum.jquery.com/topic/dropdown-option-only-setting-selected-after-alert
[00:40:39] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: I'm starting with this... http://www.datatables.net/examples/api/multi_filter_select.html ... but I want to load the data with AJAX.... as is done here... http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/data_sources/ajax.html ... but the problem being... I think the data isn't in the "right place" for the multi_filter_select to build.
[00:41:18] <sl33k_> i moved the inner if condition to the success callback but to no avail
[00:43:38] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: I went with the notion that I just needed to look at it "post initialization" ... so was using this as a guide... http://www.datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/events_post_init.html ...
[00:44:06] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: but, I'm not using that right it seems (and/or it isn't the actual problem)
[00:44:46] <Catharz> andrewgearhart: provided you put the ajax code into the $(doc).ready, I think it should just work
[00:46:02] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: I can get either the ajax code to work... or the multi-select... but not both
[00:46:16] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: just not sure how to integrate the two
[00:47:17] <Catharz> andrewgearhart: k, going to have a play with it myself
[00:47:28] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: this is my doc.ready ... http://pastebin.com/6weX3mdL
[00:47:48] <andrewgearhart> the ajax works... but the drop downs don't
[00:48:15] <batt_> Hi!
[00:48:52] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: thank you for looking at it with me. I appreciate it
[00:48:54] <Catharz> andrewgearhart: I'm pretty sure you need the $.fn.dataTableExt.oApi.fnGetColumnData call too
[00:50:01] <batt_> I have this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/vnXky/ where I want to send my data via json. When I look with firefox I see it sends json... but I don't know how to catch that in php. As I can't join the php chat, I hope someone could help me here to explain me how to catch the data?
[00:50:26] <batt_> I've tried a lot to process it in php but it doesn't work :s
[00:50:38] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: hm... /me looks
[00:51:30] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: I have that... but it is before the doc.ready as it is in the multi-filter-select example...
[00:52:13] <chinoto> sl33k_: ok I think your problem is simple, just replace the content of the success function with the content of the last if: http://pastebin.com/VWhjCwA2
[00:52:31] <chinoto> I played with the code a little >.>
[00:53:50] <chinoto> I used jsmin to format it because it was indented with spaces when I copied it.
[00:57:57] <coldhead> sedatives... sedatives... sedatives...
[00:59:57] <chinoto> sl33k_: more playing >.> http://pastebin.com/3f77P1Kh
[01:00:53] <coldhead> sedatives
[01:00:58] <coldhead> sedatives
[01:01:12] <chinoto> and LSD
[01:04:34] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: I got it! http://pastebin.com/D2HWyjuR
[01:04:56] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: thank you for chatting with me about it... that's what got me to it. :)
[01:06:11] <Catharz> andrewgearhart: ah, so you had to configure it to make the fnInitComplete call?
[01:07:17] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: appears so... I was thinking try to call it after... but apparently, the way to do it is to identify the "after" call as part of the init.
[01:07:25] <coldhead> STATE OF GRACE IS OVER
[01:07:35] <naeluh> holy smokes
[01:07:39] <Catharz> andrewgearhart: cool, glad you got it working :)
[01:07:46] <andrewgearhart> Catharz: thanks again. :)

[01:10:12] <naeluh> not for cold not for pain just for sleep
[01:11:23] <naeluh> hey but jquery is awesome
[01:11:40] <coldhead> testify!
[01:11:40] <naeluh> i ll just let myself out
[01:13:46] <coldhead> hey phnix
[01:14:32] <phnix> hey coldhead
[01:20:42] <coldhead> SO MANY VARIABLES
[01:22:00] <thomedy> okay... im making a custom jquery plugin just to show tha ti can... however i am having some hard time getting layerX to do what mdn, and stackoverflow, and different jsfiddles say it should
[01:22:03] <thomedy> please help
[01:22:18] <thomedy> im trying to find cursor position accurately in canvas tag
[01:22:39] <Cork> isn't layerX depricated?
[01:23:07] <thomedy> i didn't see tha tin mdn... but i can check again
[01:25:18] <coldhead> if cork says it's deprecated then man you better believe it's deprecated
[01:25:43] <Cork> https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21868
[01:25:48] <Cork> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=674292
[01:27:34] <sl33k_> chinoto: appreciate your taking look at it... pastebin is blocked at my work.. could you place it here http://bpaste.net/
[01:27:44] <chinoto> k
[01:28:36] <chinoto> sl33k_: http://bpaste.net/show/jGjZqzHNNQN2jelfkVfE/
[01:29:04] <chinoto> I did some optimizations while looking at it (it's a hobby or something...)
[01:29:08] <thomedy> okay then i believe it... but may i ask an alternative because i have spent some time on it
[01:30:15] <Cork> thomedy: don't ask to ask, just ask
[01:30:31] <thomedy> i cant i did... i thougt... im looking for an alternitive to layerX
[01:30:53] <thomedy> so what im getting is position * 2x
[01:30:55] <thomedy> for some reason
[01:30:59] <Cork> thomedy: the mozilla bug has a comment with it in it
[01:31:15] <thomedy> so go to mdn... is that where i m finding the comment
[01:31:16] <coldhead> position = position / 2 ?
[01:31:20] <Cork> thomedy: i suspect you want offsetX/offsetY
[01:31:26] <Cork> or just x y
[01:31:53] <sl33k_> chinoto: after commenting out alert its not working as expected
[01:32:09] <chinoto> what are you expecting again?
[01:32:42] <sl33k_> chinoto: $state.val(selectedCtgry); this set selected value
[01:33:33] <chinoto> sl33k_: I think the problem is simple that you can't select an option like that, need to test
[01:33:46] <Cork> chinoto: you can
[01:34:09] <Cork> wait.. your doing async ajax calls?
[01:34:12] <thomedy> if i post my small sample im asking for someone to look at the work... and either tell me what to read that im missing or jus ttell e what im missing
[01:35:04] <jjjW> any way i can make this dropdown (using chosen plugin) to pop outside of the container div?
[01:35:08] <jjjW> http://i.imgur.com/sZW9wxs.png
[01:35:22] <Cork> chinoto: btw why are you setting the city value again?
[01:35:25] <Cork> you never change it
[01:35:50] <chinoto> Cork: I didn't change the code really, just reorganized it
[01:35:56] <Cork> jjjW: overflow:visible;
[01:36:31] <Cork> chinoto: is it the setting of city or the setting of state that doens't work?
[01:36:49] <chinoto> Cork: ask sl33k_
[01:37:04] <Cork> uh... ok so i mixed up the source :x
[01:37:07] <Cork> :d
[01:37:20] <Cork> sl33k_: btw why are you using [].value in the top?
[01:37:22] <sl33k_> Cork: he is working on my code.. i set selected value but populate the dropdown at the same time
[01:37:46] <sl33k_> chinoto: that part chinoto modified to test
[01:37:53] <Cork> sl33k_: your checking selectedCtgry, but the one that can cause problem is selectedCtgry1
[01:38:15] <Cork> sl33k_: can you use jsfiddle?
[01:38:24] <Cork> it makes it easier to work with the code
[01:38:46] <jjjW> Cork: almost there! :D now it shows however now when i add more elements it doesn't add scrollbars :(
[01:38:46] <zulu-gula> I have problem with window.close() - it's not working
[01:39:36] <chinoto> sl33k_: interesting, so setting the selected option by val does work...
[01:40:13] <chinoto> Cork: this is his original code: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/dropdown-option-only-setting-selected-after-alert
[01:40:22] <Cork> sl33k_: try http://jsfiddle.net/qWCRR/
[01:40:59] <zulu-gula> $("#eu_cookie a.disagree").click(function(event){
[01:40:59] <zulu-gula> window.close();
[01:40:59] <zulu-gula> }); not working on ff/chrome, probably in other browsers too
[01:41:20] <Cork> zulu-gula: is this in a page opened from a window.open ?
[01:41:27] <zulu-gula> no
[01:41:34] <Cork> then you can't use window.close()
[01:41:55] <sl33k_> Cork: Cant view result... blocked at my workplace
[01:42:07] <zulu-gula> Cork: so is it possible at all? to close current window/ browser tab?
[01:42:12] <Cork> ugg, you work at a shity place...
[01:42:20] <Cork> zulu-gula: exactly
[01:42:58] <Cork> sl33k_: http://www.bpaste.net/show/XGOBsI8cYSo8b6tG64Cw/
[01:43:34] <raj> holy crap
[01:43:44] <raj> it took that long to minimize that code
[01:43:54] <Cork> raj: fun
[01:43:55] <raj> 'gut', rather
[01:44:01] <raj> not really :)
[01:44:04] <raj> http://207.38.222.88:8080/testvar
[01:44:06] <Cork> raj: you should prob try to split it up...
[01:44:08] <chinoto> sl33k_: I only just now decided to understand the code... You are trying to repopulate the city select with data and then attempt to set the selected option to what it was previously if possible?
[01:44:15] <raj> oh damn
[01:44:19] <raj> think I gut too much, one sec
[01:44:23] <Cork> lol
[01:44:32] <Cork> raj: Internal Server Error
[01:45:14] <Cork> chinoto: yes
[01:45:28] <Cork> and it should work as just fine
[01:45:40] <chinoto> agreed
[01:45:55] <sl33k__> Cork, chinoto: got disconnected
[01:46:00] <Cork> ...
[01:46:09] <Cork> sl33k_: http://www.bpaste.net/show/XGOBsI8cYSo8b6tG64Cw/
[01:46:10] <chinoto> sl33k__: I think I know the problem
[01:46:25] <chinoto> sl33k__: are you getting the alert of line 23?
[01:46:44] <Cork> sl33k__: actually try http://www.bpaste.net/show/SSttzFTPyhOBDVHfh9KY/
[01:48:16] <chinoto> doh! he's gone again
[01:48:22] <Cork> ya
[01:48:30] <chinoto> no, he's here
[01:48:38] <chinoto> sl33k__: >.<
[01:48:44] <Cork> lol
[01:48:54] <sl33k__> nope trying
[01:49:07] <chinoto> sl33k__: no alert from success?
[01:49:13] <Cork> might pick an alternative nick that differs a bit more :)
[01:49:39] <chinoto> I think the problem is that you didn't set the content-type in your header
[01:49:47] <chinoto> jquery is picky about that
[01:50:03] <Cork> chinoto: we checked that a while back i think
[01:50:15] <Cork> at least i asked for it before i had to run
[01:50:45] <Cork> chinoto: <sl33k_> Cork: 7
[01:50:56] <Cork> so ya, its an object with 6 keys
[01:51:03] <Cork> sorry 7 >_<
[01:51:40] <thomedy> http://www.thesartorer.com/flunk_it/customjqplugin/
[01:51:44] <chinoto> sl33k__: run this http://www.bpaste.net/show/qoM4Hi65EmWtVHHI6J6s/
[01:51:50] <thomedy> please help
[01:52:00] <chinoto> and open the web console
[01:52:07] <chinoto> ctrl+shift+k in firefox
[01:52:14] <raj> Cork, okie dokes
[01:52:15] <raj> ready
[01:52:16] <raj> http://207.38.222.88:8080/testvar
[01:53:57] <Cork> raj: wfm
[01:54:25] <Cork> chinoto: fail might be more insteresting then always
[01:54:32] <raj> k
[01:54:39] <raj> (had to look that one up) :)
[01:55:03] <chinoto> Cork: nah, because with always we can see the result of any event.
[01:55:22] <Cork> raj: Object[div.row] itemselector.js (line 22) | Object[div.row] itemselector.js (line 22) | Object[div.row] itemselector.js (line 22)
[01:55:37] <raj> huh?
[01:55:48] <Cork> chinoto: ya, but we already know the success event triggers and have an object with 7 keys
[01:56:51] <Cork> chinoto: also always doesn't get the parsed responses
[01:56:59] <Cork> it only gets the plainText content
[01:57:18] <chinoto> now there's a valid point...
[01:57:34] <Cork> chinoto: well both are
[01:57:36] <chinoto> unless, does always tell if it failed?
[01:57:56] <Cork> it contains the xhr object
[01:58:05] <Cork> but no it doesn't have an error argument
[01:58:48] <Cork> but that's still beside the point as we've already gotten past that point
[01:58:54] <sl33k__> Cork: tried out your changes same problem as before
[01:59:17] <Cork> sl33k__: and if you add a console.log('loop'); in the each function?
[01:59:31] <Cork> do you get 7 outputs from it?
[02:00:52] <chinoto> just looked at it, unless the arguments explicitly tell you, .always() doesn't seem to give any indication as to whether it was a triggered by resolve or reject
[02:01:11] <raj> is this a joke?
[02:01:17] <Cork> raj?
[02:01:17] <raj> the code is working now?
[02:01:20] <Cork> lol
[02:01:38] <Cork> ya, i fixed it when you didn't look ;)
[02:01:40] <raj> is that what you were telling me Cork ?
[02:01:44] <Cork> yes
[02:01:46] <raj> omg
[02:01:48] <raj> omfg
[02:01:53] <Cork> ?wfm
[02:01:53] <b-ot> Cork: WORKS FOR ME
[02:01:56] <bot-t> Cork, VML + IE + jQuery = "Failed" - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4723
[02:02:06] <Cork> bot-t: hush
[02:02:08] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "hush" in jQuery Docs.
[02:02:31] <raj> Cork, if I don't console.log it after setting the variable, it doesn't work
[02:02:46] <raj> check it out
[02:02:48] <Cork> what?
[02:03:11] <sl33k__> Cork: yes 7 times
[02:03:38] <Cork> sl33k__: and $city.childern().length after the loop ?
[02:03:43] <Cork> (sorry after the html)
[02:03:43] <raj> Cork, refresh the page and try doing `console.log(container)`
[02:03:50] <raj> after clicking `thing`
[02:06:08] <chinoto> sl33k__: looked at ajax, this should be useful for debugging: http://www.bpaste.net/show/aZyayUjWegA3pCgQeOCP/
[02:07:14] <Cork> raj: actually if you use the options variable instead, does that work?
[02:07:21] <sl33k__> Cork: 0
[02:07:27] <Cork> oook
[02:07:28] <raj> Cork, no
[02:07:35] <Cork> raj: weird
[02:07:40] <raj> yep
[02:07:50] <Cork> raj: the log works for me in firefox btw
[02:07:58] <raj> oh hmm
[02:08:01] <Cork> sl33k__: oook, so now we're getting somewhere
[02:08:54] <Cork> sl33k__: the reason it all fails is cause $('<option/>',{val:key,text:value}) fails
[02:09:03] <raj> it's definitely some gc issue, right?
[02:09:04] <Cork> now what's left is understanding why
[02:09:11] <Cork> raj: sounds likely ya
[02:09:25] <Cork> espectially cause console.loging it in the next scope fixes it
[02:09:36] <raj> yep
[02:09:46] <chinoto> it's 4am, I need to get up in... 3 hours (DAMMIT!), so I gotta leave so I can do a bit of coding for work and go to bed.
[02:09:52] <raj> if I do `var test = container` within the clickhandler, it fixes it too
[02:10:08] <sl33k__> Cork: I see.
[02:11:38] <Cork> sl33k__: try add($('<option/>').attr('value', key).text(value))
[02:11:50] <Cork> sl33k__: that should generate a valid option
[02:12:00] <raj> Cork, how would you handle this situation?
[02:12:35] <raj> a) ignore it + work around it? b) get to the bottom of this?
[02:12:46] <Cork> raj: try using $.extend({}, options) in the outer scope
[02:13:01] <Cork> options = $.extend({}, options);
[02:13:23] <Cork> that way you get you're own copy of that object
[02:13:24] <raj> var options = $.extend({}, options); ?
[02:13:43] <Cork> options is already defined in the arguments list so var isn't needed
[02:13:46] <Cork> but ya
[02:13:46] <raj> as opposed to who's copy of that object?
[02:13:51] <sl33k__> Cork: is puuting the success body in complete work?
[02:13:57] <sl33k__> will*
[02:14:03] <Cork> raj: the one passed in
[02:14:24] <Cork> sl33k__: no
[02:14:28] <raj> yeah, but why isn't that "my own copy of that object"
[02:14:43] <Cork> raj: cause objects is memory pointers they don't copy
[02:14:54] <kroyeren> So, I taken over development of a site, that uses a jquery-selectbox plugin to style (I assume) a dropdown-list. I have searced for those kind of plugins, and there are a lot of them. All of them seems to replace the select/option markup with a div/span style. I
[02:15:02] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; b = a; b.something = 1; JSON.stringify(a)
[02:15:03] <raj> Cork, btw, that didn't resolve the issue
[02:15:05] <bot-t> Cork: "{\"something\":1}"
[02:15:22] <raj> you can refresh and see
[02:15:58] <kroyeren> (cont) am unsure why this is done, as it disables the funktion of moving down in the list on a key-press...
[02:16:13] <kmdm> Hi guys - Does this look like a jQueryUI Sortable bug? http://jsfiddle.net/m6GSz/
[02:17:37] <Cork> raj: and if you reference it at all in that scope?
[02:17:46] <raj> then it works
[02:18:04] <Cork> ok, so it just doesn't keep it in that scope unless it's referenced
[02:18:08] <Cork> kinda makes sense
[02:18:10] <raj> yeah
[02:18:15] <Cork> raj: why would that be a problem?
[02:18:21] <kroyeren> example: http://www.bulgaria-web-developers.com/projects/javascript/selectbox/
[02:18:58] <Cork> kroyeren: cause you can't style a select box
[02:19:10] <Cork> so you have to replace it with something js generated that can be styled
[02:19:13] <raj> not sure
[02:19:40] <Cork> raj: i suspect you have removed a little too much
[02:19:43] <raj> i think it was causing greater trouble in the ungutted code
[02:19:51] <Cork> as the point that experience the problem isn't there
[02:20:12] <raj> k
[02:20:34] <kroyeren> Cork, so if I want the functionality of moving down to elements starting with S when the user presses S, i need to ad an additional js plugin (and the obvious next question would be - does such a plugin exists?)
[02:21:49] <Cork> kroyeren: ya, that is what would be needed, and donno, i try to stay away from messing with the native form elements, as it causes a lot of functionality losses
[02:22:11] <kroyeren> Cork, indeed it does. Thank you
[02:22:38] <Cork> well messing with when it can't be done through pure css that is
[02:22:49] <Cork> i have no problems with styling the element if the browser supports it
[02:23:14] <Cork> i take functionality over design anyday
[02:24:02] <sl33k__> Cork: options are emptied somehow
[02:24:16] <marlun> I'm in a codebase which uses several different jquery versions and now I'm having problems with code which isn't called on 'ready' because it's added to a readylist for a version which does not seem to be called. Any idea on how I could get around this?
[02:24:24] <Cork> sl33k__: could you make an updated pb with how the code looks right now?
[02:25:16] <kroyeren> Cork, unfortunately the customer/designer does not totally agree with the functionality > design
[02:25:20] <Cork> marlun: you really, REALLY R-E-A-L-L-Y shouldn't be using multiple versions of jquery
[02:25:34] <sl33k__> Cork: i have many selects with same functionality. i will do it for title
[02:25:49] <Cork> marlun: there is compatibility libs to make old functions work in newer versions of jquery, its a much safer (and smaller) way to do
[02:26:13] <Cork> kroyeren: well i mainly point at the amount of lost functionality
[02:26:24] <Cork> you basically get a browser select box in a mobile browser
[02:26:38] <Cork> and for most of those plugins its not even usable at all
[02:26:52] <sl33k__> Cork: http://www.bpaste.net/show/KmJfCalBYUfvOtFzBDSz/
[02:27:27] <Cork> sl33k__: 1. drop d1= data;, 2. drop async: false
[02:27:50] <Cork> aah
[02:27:57] <Cork> you missed loads of what i did before
[02:28:02] <Cork> its all wrong :s
[02:28:25] <marlun> Cork: I can't change that since I'm just integrating some code into an already existing codebase unfortunately. If I could I would've :)
[02:29:45] <Cork> sl33k: http://www.bpaste.net/show/2eSaHTrRwW1MK81H2fVo/
[02:29:52] <Cork> opps
[02:30:02] <Cork> http://www.bpaste.net/show/Sjyh6XVij85VCHVH6yEj/
[02:30:49] <Cork> marlun: there isn't really a safe way to run multiple versions of jquery on the same page
[02:31:14] <Cork> marlun: from my experience it always result in broken ness one way or another
[02:31:28] <Cork> (compatibility with other libs is normally find though)
[02:34:25] <sl33k> Cork: var $options = $(); this is not binded to any dropdown, no?
[02:34:35] <Cork> sl33k: its an empty container
[02:34:46] <Cork> its similar to var options = [];
[02:34:51] <Cork> (but not the same)
[02:36:12] <sl33k> oh ok
[02:40:24] <sl33k_> Cork: with alert works. without it same problem
[02:40:53] <Cork> sl33k_: do you have other event listeners doing similar things?
[02:41:03] <Cork> that's the only thing i can think of
[02:41:18] <Cork> can't really see why else you would get that problem now...
[02:41:41] <sl33k_> Cork: yes i have similiar ones on country, state suburb and city dropdowns
[02:42:00] <Cork> sl33k_: i mean that triggers on the same element
[02:42:10] <Cork> try disable the other sections and see if the problem still happens
[02:42:48] <sl33k_> Cork: no only click on title menu
[02:43:26] <Cork> sl33k_: that is as far as i can get you without seeing running code
[02:43:40] <Cork> the code you have should work, and... can't do more with dead pb's
[02:44:31] <sl33k_> Cork: full jsp http://www.bpaste.net/show/wSi7hbJgpyB05O314Weh/
[02:45:01] <Cork> sl33k_: pb's doesn't help me
[02:45:57] <sl33k_> commented out other jquery but problem still persists
[02:47:30] <sl33k_> Cork: any other way left?
[02:47:50] <Cork> sl33k_: if you can reproduce the problem on jsfiddle, that would help
[02:48:17] <batt> Does anyone knows what's the good workaround? http://jsfiddle.net/WySh3/ -> $(this).children doesn't work?
[02:49:03] <sl33k_> Cork: from where would the ajax get response in jsfiddle?
[02:49:19] <Cork> batt: first doens't take a function; actually it doesn't take arguments at all
[02:49:35] <Cork> sl33k_: you could fake it with an object and setTimeout
[02:50:01] <Cork> setTimeout(function() { var data = {}; }, 0)
[02:50:58] <batt> Ok Cork
[02:51:05] <batt> I will search on with that information
[02:51:07] <batt> thx
[02:52:10] <sl33k_> Cork: but the alerts help in this. do you know why?
[02:52:34] <Cork> sl33k_: cause it freezes the code stack
[02:52:42] <Cork> sl33k_: you can a race somewhere
[02:53:33] <sl33k_> Cork: are there any syntactic alternative I could use?
[02:53:51] <Cork> sl33k_: to fix the race?
[02:53:54] <Cork> no not really
[02:54:11] <sl33k_> getjson or?
[02:54:13] <Cork> you have something doing things when you don't expect it, and it breaking things for you
[02:54:22] <Cork> this code isn't the probem
[02:54:29] <Cork> the problem is somewhere else
[02:54:34] <sam452> Thanks to you Cork: for taking that second look. Shifting to CSS fixec most of them!
[02:54:48] <Cork> sl33k_: you need to fix the part that messes with you, not the part that is messed with :)
[02:55:11] <Cork> sam452: always try to solve things with css if possible :)
[02:55:40] <Cork> only use js as a last resort or possibly as enhancement
[02:55:59] <daanavitch> I have to make an object follow a path when the user scrolls, how can I do this?
[02:56:41] <Cork> daanavitch: trigger on the scroll event and calculate the new position of the object
[02:57:47] <daanavitch> Cork: problem is that it's a complicated path, not just a straight line
[02:58:15] <Cork> daanavitch: ya, so you would have to keep a list of points where it needs to change its position equations
[02:58:18] <sl33k_> Cork: could i put something other in place of alert which would help?
[02:58:44] <sl33k_> are there any silent alerts? lol
[02:58:46] <Cork> sl33k_: the alert works out of side effect
[02:58:51] <daanavitch> Cork: I would need to define a few hundred points, simply not possible
[02:59:02] <daanavitch> I found the scrollpath plugin, but it hasn't been updated in a year
[02:59:03] <Cork> sl33k_: you really need to find the cause
[02:59:19] <Cork> daanavitch: so update it
[02:59:31] <daanavitch> lol
[02:59:34] <daanavitch> I'm not a jQuery dev
[02:59:37] <Cork> daanavitch: what i said would be what the plugin would have to do
[02:59:50] <Cork> there isn't really any other way around it
[02:59:58] <sl33k_> Cork: does console.log works like alert
[03:00:07] <Cork> daanavitch: well then it's time to get your feet wet
[03:00:12] <Cork> sl33k_: no
[03:00:22] <Nobita> hi I'm trying to bind my code, but its not working for me since I'm having click function with remove function http://pastebin.com/zJffjkzc how can I bind them?
[03:00:36] <Cork> sl33k_: alert is among the only things in js that freezes the js code and gives control back to the browser
[03:00:44] <Cork> confirm is another
[03:01:30] <Cork> Nobita: too little context
[03:01:40] <Cork> what are you trying to do, and what isn't working?
[03:02:48] <Nobita> Cork: sorry, but that's the same suggestion that you have provided me to bind them line no 14 here
[03:02:48] <Nobita> http://pastebin.com/dZLCFtDg
[03:03:02] <Cork> ?.on
[03:03:05] <bot-t> Cork, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:03:37] <Cork> Nobita: http://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data
[03:03:43] <Cork> that is what you need
[03:03:45] <Nobita> I worked with bind, but on many examples over the internet, stackoverflow and many places I wasn't able to find how to bind click and removeClass fucntions at a time http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[03:03:50] <lemonsparrow> I am using jquery to autosuggest and chose value from list of matching alphabets as user starts typing in. It's working fine.. what i would like to know is... is there anyway I can make this text field non editable once the user selects a value from the autosuggest list
[03:04:07] <lemonsparrow> ?
[03:04:16] <Cork> Nobita: bind and removeClass has nothing to do with each other
[03:04:22] <Cork> Nobita: there is no conflict there
[03:04:27] <Nobita> ok
[03:04:37] <Nobita> so what I have to do right now with on()
[03:05:02] <Cork> Nobita: and .click is a shorthand for bind('click' (to more exactly on('click' all those three are the same things
[03:05:14] <Cork> Nobita: its the delegated event handler
[03:05:31] <Nobita> ok
[03:05:44] <Cork> Nobita: you need to use a delegated event handler bound on an element that always exist, and that listens for the element when it has been added
[03:15:24] <Nobita> Cork: fyi now I found out that the modal for only that ##simplemodal-login is coming by using this JS http://pastebin.com/PaZc7eRV
[03:15:42] <Aha2Y> How  does google do that so if you load the page it directly puts the cursor in the search bar so you can directly start typing?
[03:16:03] <Cork> Nobita: didn't the delegated event listener solve it?
[03:17:07] <Cork> Aha2Y: the first input field in a form is automatically focused
[03:17:27] <Cork> Aha2Y: additionally .focus() in js on the element focus it, so that is an additional option
[03:17:49] <Cork> Aha2Y: and thirdly html has an autofocus attribute now days
[03:18:39] <Cork> Aha2Y: and the autofocus actually has quite good support (except for in ie)
[03:20:05] <Aha2Y> Really? Which is the html autofocus attrubute? autofocus=yes ? :D
[03:22:14] <Cork> Aha2Y: <input autofocus>
[03:22:53] <Aha2Y> Which would not work if i first have to press a button which toggles the panel with the input box?
[03:23:11] <Cork> Aha2Y: yes
[03:23:28] <Cork> if you show the form with js you use .focus() on the element you want focus on
[03:24:50] <Aha2Y> i tried that.
[03:24:51] <Aha2Y> look
[03:24:52] <Aha2Y> http://privatepaste.com/d21e41d26c
[03:25:40] <Cork> Aha2Y: console.log($('.fname').length)
[03:25:46] <Aha2Y> 								<td><input autofocus type="text" name="fname" class='required' size="25"></td>
[03:25:47] <Aha2Y> hm
[03:25:52] <Cork> ah
[03:26:01] <Aha2Y> Why the lenght? :o
[03:26:17] <Cork> that would mean $('.add-person-pane input[name="fname"').focus()
[03:26:22] <Cork> opps
[03:26:27] <Cork> $('.add-person-pane input[name="fname"}').focus()
[03:26:30] <Cork> bah
[03:26:33] <Cork> you get the point
[03:26:43] <Aha2Y> i do? :|
[03:26:53] <Cork> fine use $('.add-person-pane input[name="fname"]').focus()
[03:27:16] <Aha2Y> It works
[03:27:30] <Aha2Y> I didn't know that was possible :O
[03:28:04] <Cork> it's called an attribute selector
[03:28:18] <Cork> and if works if you have a short set of elements to match
[03:28:39] <Cork> but it's slow so you should use it with discretion
[03:36:35] <jkarsrud> Hi all. I have a nested sortable accordion, but I want to collapse the current accordion item when I start sorting. Any ideas?
[03:37:38] <raj> can I set a clickoutsideonce?
[03:38:07] <Cork> raj: $(document).one('click', function() {});
[03:38:41] <raj> thanks Cork
[03:39:15] <Zepo> Hey Guys, need some help. So I am using this plugin -> https://code.google.com/p/ufd/  The trunk version ( didn't helped if I would change it to anything else) The problem here is, it works total awesome on Chrome, but bugs on FireFox /  IE, instead of showing one "search-dropdown" , it show 2 dropdowns, one with the ufd-skin and one simple. But without search function
[03:39:16] <raj> Cork, along with .not()?
[03:39:49] <Cork> raj: $(event.target).is() or closest()
[03:40:05] <Zepo> It works on Chrome and Safari ( boss has an apple)*
[03:40:12] <Cork> raj: unless you prefer to use stopPropagation() on the element you don't want it to get it from
[03:40:57] <raj> how does $(event.target).is() help?
[03:41:17] <raj> or you mean use that along with .not()?
[03:41:28] <raj> stopPropagation would cause other issues down the line I'm sure
[03:41:47] <Cork> raj: not won't help you
[03:42:09] <Cork> raj: you will either have to check if the click source is inside the element you don't want to handle
[03:42:15] <raj> so just return if $(event.target).is() whatever?
[03:42:27] <Cork> raj: or you have to bind a click handler on the element you want to not get it from and do event.stopPropagation() there
[03:42:40] <Cork> raj: with a selector in is yes
[03:44:21] <jkarsrud> basic prototype of my problem; http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/w5CJd/
[03:44:45] <jkarsrud> when you drag an expanded item there, I want to collapse it
[03:48:56] <jkarsrud> or would it be easier to write my own accordion, and just hook on sortable on top of that perhaps?
[03:49:46] <Krambiorix> hi, i have fullcalendar running in an iframe. And from a sibling iframe i want to call some functions on that fullcalendar. Does anyone know if this is possible?
[03:49:57] <raj> Cork, what if I wanted to give a list of elements to ignore within document?
[03:50:03] <raj> including those elements children
[03:50:07] <Cork> Krambiorix: is all the pages on the same domain?
[03:50:17] <Krambiorix> Cork, yesz
[03:50:30] <Cork> raj: that why i said you prob need .closest too
[03:50:35] <Cork> Krambiorix: then yes you can
[03:51:16] <Cork> $(window.parent()).contains().find('other iframe').contains().find('target')
[03:51:20] <Cork> Krambiorix: ^
[03:51:33] <Cork> window.parent might be wrong btw
[03:51:42] <raj> Cork, so iterate through those elements with the $target.closest('.first_element_to_ignore') ?
[03:51:44] <Cork> don't remember if its a function or a variable
[03:52:15] <Krambiorix> Cork, i try like this http://pastebin.com/s1L5LZxm  but that doesn't work
[03:52:18] <Krambiorix> (error included)
[03:52:37] <Cork> raj: i don't remember if something like $(event.target).is('.first_element_to_ignore, .first_element_to_ignore *') would work
[03:53:06] <Cork> Krambiorix: i'm quite sure its not parent .window.document
[03:53:39] <Cork> Krambiorix: and that would have to look for the other iframe, not the calender
[03:53:56] <Krambiorix> $("#calendariframe",parent.window.document).contents().find("#calendar_view").length() => 1
[03:54:21] <raj> hmm, I should be using namespaces
[03:54:30] <raj> I'd be less apprehensive to have clickhandlers on document
[03:54:34] <raj> and I think that would make life easier
[03:54:39] <Cork> Krambiorix: length isn't a function
[03:54:57] <raj> so that I didn't have the clickhandlers for different pages always active and listening
[03:55:10] <Cork> raj: ya, for things like this you should definitely use namespaces
[03:55:17] <raj> gonna have to grep for 'click', fml
[03:55:30] <raj> actually, for `.on(`
[03:55:32] <rayfun> Hi, I've got a simple jquery selector question: function updateShippingCountry(countryVal) { $("select#shipping_CountryCode option[value=countryVal]").attr('selected',true); } .. the referencing of the variable in the attribute selector does not seem to work here.. any idea? thanks!
[03:56:19] <Cork> rayfun:  $("select#shipping_CountryCode").cal()
[03:56:48] <Cork> uh... sorry val not cal
[03:57:00] <Krambiorix> Cork, ow sry   .length returns 1
[03:57:12] <Cork> Krambiorix: ok, so you find the target element
[03:57:16] <Cork> what isn't working?
[03:57:21] <maZrtr> hi guys. $(document).ajaxError(function() {   alert('error!'); }); should alert when a statuscode 400 is received, right?
[03:57:24] <raj> Cork, how often do you use $(document).on('click',...) ?
[03:57:36] <Krambiorix> cview.fullCalendar('myfunction')  ===> cview.fullCalendar is not a function
[03:57:38] <Cork> raj: as rarely as i possibly can
[03:57:45] <Cork> raj: click outside is one of them
[03:58:07] <Cork> Krambiorix: cause fullCalender is defined in the other iframe right?
[03:58:15] <Krambiorix> Cork yes
[03:58:45] <Cork> parent.window.$('#calendariframe') might work
[04:00:13] <Krambiorix> Cork, same error TypeError: cview.fullCalendar is not a function
[04:00:59] <Cork> kraft: you will have to reach into the scope of the other iframe to get a hold of that function
[04:01:02] <Krambiorix> Cork, but cview.length = 1
[04:01:13] <rayfun> Cork, don't understand how this applies here. Can you explain? I'm trying to set a certain option that is referenced by countryVal of a existing select list
[04:01:17] <Nobita> Cork: first of all thanks for your suggestion, it worked :) now I'm very near, just need your bit help :) please check http://staging.iamknighted.com/ now the thing is working but I have to click twice then its getting disappeared
[04:01:20] <Cork> Krambiorix: but if you don't use the jquery from that page it won't work
[04:01:35] <Nobita> if I clicked on Sign in
[04:01:43] <Krambiorix> Cork, how do you mean?
[04:02:04] <Cork> rayfun: you set what option to select by setting val on the select, not by setting an attribute on the option
[04:02:16] <Cork> rayfun: also attr doesn't take true as a value
[04:02:44] <Cork> rayfun: if selected on the option would help, it would have been prop('selected', true) not attr, but for options its done on the select element
[04:03:35] <Nobita> I have changed all ".click(function () {" to ".bind('click', function() {"
[04:03:45] <raj> no '-' in namespaces I take it?
[04:03:50] <raj> of eventhandlers
[04:03:53] <raj> treat them like variables?
[04:04:06] <raj> not like classes
[04:04:31] <Cork> Nobita: where is the js?
[04:04:33] <Nobita> raj: to whom?
[04:05:13] <Krambiorix> Cork , how do you mean? "but if you don't use the jquery from that page it won't work"
[04:05:14] <Cork> Nobita: like i said... there is no point changing .click to .bind('click' that is the same thing
[04:05:35] <raj> Nobita, to whom what?
[04:05:39] <Cork> you need to delegate your event listeners if the element doesn't exist when your code run
[04:05:53] <Cork> raj: i think - is fine in namespace, but not sure
[04:06:27] <Cork> Krambiorix: what makes iframes so hard to handle is that each iframe is it's own document, and it's own javascript scope
[04:06:30] <Nobita> Cork: http://pastebin.com/diff.php?i=NhdTA6Ep please check
[04:06:38] <Cork> so jquery in your page won't have the functions loaded in the other page
[04:06:55] <Cork> Nobita: that won't change a thing
[04:07:09] <Krambiorix> Cork, can i do something about that?
[04:07:26] <Nobita> Cork: can you please help me with a sample, please
[04:07:31] <Cork> Krambiorix: yes, you need to grab a reference to the jquery from the page where the calender is defined
[04:07:48] <Cork> Nobita: is #mobile-header-wrapper dynamically created?
[04:07:56] <Cork> or is it static?
[04:08:44] <Nobita> static
[04:09:10] <Krambiorix> Cork, how can i do that? :s
[04:11:45] <Cork> Krambiorix: one way might be to define a function in that scope that does what you want and use that instead
[04:11:55] <rayfun> Cork, thanks!
[04:11:59] <Cork> Krambiorix: else you would have to fiddle and see where you can get it
[04:12:15] <Cork> there is a reason why i say as far away from iframes as i possibly can :)
[04:12:19] <Cork> rayfun: np
[04:12:32] <Nobita> Cork:
[04:13:12] <Cork> ?
[04:13:22] <Krambiorix> Cork,  ok, i'll try to solve it different
[04:13:46] <Cork> Krambiorix: good luck (i know how frustrating things like that can be)
[04:14:22] <Nobita> its the static one
[04:14:30] <Nobita> so what we have to do with it?
[04:14:50] <fat> if you click on this button, the text disappears. how do i do the same if by clicking on the image. please help!! http://jsfiddle.net/hefGK/152/
[04:17:27] <fabioportieri_> fat: that code doesn't even use jquery, and you have two elements with same id...
[04:17:37] <Cork> fat: that question looks more like its for #javascript then #jquery as you don't have a single line of jquery in there
[04:18:54] <Nobita> should I use the code in window.load () Cork ?
[04:19:14] <Nobita> no
[04:19:18] <Cork> Nobita: i don't have the time to dig that deep into the page
[04:19:21] <Nobita> that's not working too
[04:19:41] <Cork> Nobita: and it's not something i can directly guess what's going wrong
[04:19:58] <Nobita> ok, thanks for your help Cork :) np
[04:21:57] <fabioportieri_> nobita i don't know what your issue is but you should provide less code in your testcase...
[04:22:33] <Nobita> thanks fabioportieri_ but how?
[04:24:25] <Nobita> My only issue there is with a link on my site i.e. "Sign In" which should provide blur class to the body and when clicked outside of it, the class "blur"; should get removed in whcih Cork helped me much but I'm not able to understand "delegate your event listeners if the element doesn't exist when your code run" its better if am able to get some examples or something
[04:29:22] <magnus_> what is the appropriate method of dynamically adding rows to a table using jQuery? ive seen examples of inserting HTML such as table.append('<tr><td>...</td></tr>'); .. but i'd rather have functions that generate the HTML, are there any? I noticed for example, when using DOM Objects, there are insertRow(), insertCell() etc.
[04:30:37] <Cork> magnus_: var tr = $('<tr/>'); tr.append($('<td/>').text('test')); table.append(tr);
[04:31:12] <fabioportieri_> Nobita: try removing irrelevant code, aniway for your issue try replacing .bind with .delegate
[04:31:20] <magnus_> Cork, excellent, thank you!
[04:31:22] <Cork> Mage: ($('<tr>') is the syntax for document.createElement in jquery)
[04:32:23] <magnus_> Cork, i was under the impression that $('expr') was mostly for searching for existing objects using selectors. How can $('expr') also be used to create new objectS?
[04:32:44] <Cork> magnus_: the <>
[04:32:52] <magnus_> ah, gotcha. thanks
[04:32:57] <Cork> magnus_: jquery checks for there existence
[04:36:28] <maZrtr> (because it doesn't do that.....)
[04:36:30] <maZrtr> hi guys. $(document).ajaxError(function() {   alert('error!'); }); should alert when a statuscode 400 is received, right?
[04:37:48] <Cork> maZrtr: yes, as far as i understand it it should
[04:37:55] <Cork> (never really used it my self)
[04:38:18] <magnus_> Cork, what is wrong with doing this: cell1 = tr.append('<td/>'); cell2 = tr.append('<td/>'); cell1.text("hi"); cell2.text("world"); table.append(tr); .. it seem to create just one <TD>, with the text of cell2. If I move cell1.text() below cell2.text(), it will override the value. As if there is only 1 TD
[04:38:45] <Cork> magnus_: call1 will be tr, not the td
[04:38:48] <Cork> *cell
[04:39:06] <jkarsrud> maZrtr: yep, 400 is an error code, so it _should_
[04:39:21] <magnus_> Cork, oh, so tr.append() returns tr itself?
[04:39:27] <Cork> yes
[04:39:28] <maZrtr> any idea what could be the reason it doesn't?
[04:39:40] <magnus_> how can I find a reference to the TD then?
[04:40:03] <Cork> magnus_: var cell1 = $('<td/>'); tr.append(cell1);
[04:40:13] <magnus_> oh, right. misread your example!
[04:49:25] <Zepo> Hum
[04:50:15] <Zepo> How do I use http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox ? Do I have to implement on my own ?
[04:51:01] <Cork> Zepo: click the view source
[04:58:59] <raj> Cork, is there an issue if I do .on('click.something' multiple times in a row?
[04:59:06] <Cork> no
[04:59:19] <raj> it recognizes the same function being called?
[04:59:22] <Cork> that's kinda the point of namespaces
[04:59:26] <Cork> no
[04:59:28] <edlinde> is there an example of how I can submit a form using ajax in jquery/
[04:59:29] <edlinde> ?
[04:59:39] <edlinde> wondering if its even possible?
[04:59:41] <Cork> edlinde: $('form').submit()
[04:59:49] <Cork> ah ajax
[04:59:56] <Zepo> That sucks. Is there no easy working selectbox with searchfield ?
[04:59:57] <Cork> ?.serialize @ edlinde
[04:59:57] <bot-t> edlinde, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[04:59:58] <edlinde> Cork, yeah
[05:00:12] <Cork> ?.post
[05:00:13] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[05:00:20] <Cork> edlinde: those two is all you need
[05:00:25] <edlinde> I don't have much data to send
[05:00:28] <raj> Cork, so you're saying it binds `click` 10x
[05:00:28] <raj> ?
[05:00:32] <edlinde> Cork, do you do any backend stuff?
[05:00:35] <Cork> raj: yes
[05:00:52] <Cork> edlinde: to the backend its just a post message
[05:00:59] <raj> can I check if it's on or off?
[05:01:01] <Cork> edlinde: and yes i handle the entire stack (including the server)
[05:01:11] <bel3atar> in http://welldonethings.com/tags/manager they say I can use these methods: .tagsManager('popTag'); and .tagsManager('pushTag','I_am_a_new_tag'); ... etc. It's not even correct syntax...
[05:01:12] <Cork> raj: is what's on or off?
[05:01:14] <edlinde> Its just that I am wondering that if I serve a static index.html page with a form so users can enter their params
[05:01:47] <raj> if I can turn an eventlistener on and off, how can I check its current status?
[05:02:04] <edlinde> so initially I have /index.html as some static page with a map on it... users enter details in this form and click send, which makes an ajax request to some other link like .. /form-response/
[05:02:14] <edlinde> which then returns JSON string with results
[05:02:19] <edlinde> is this possible?
[05:03:32] <Cork> edlinde: if the original page is static or not doesn't really matter
[05:03:43] <Cork> and yes you can post json, you need to encode it though
[05:03:51] <edlinde> Cork, so you are saying that the ajax call will look like a get or post request to the server code?
[05:03:51] <Cork> but other then that, sure
[05:04:06] <edlinde> Nah I want to return JSON
[05:04:09] <Cork> edlinde: except for an additional header yes
[05:04:10] <edlinde> not on the way to the server
[05:04:11] <edlinde> :)
[05:04:17] <edlinde> ok
[05:04:34] <edlinde> so I just have a few params to send..like lat/lng coordinates and 3-4 keywords
[05:04:40] <edlinde> use a get request?
[05:05:49] <edlinde> how do I make a get request sent out as ajax?
[05:05:59] <bel3atar> help please
[05:06:03] <edlinde> Cork, $('form').submit() ?
[05:06:03] <Cork> edlinde: i linked to it a bit back
[05:06:14] <Cork> edlinde: no you need to serialzie the form
[05:06:21] <Cork> ?.serialize
[05:06:22] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[05:06:31] <Cork> and then you give that to post see ?.post
[05:06:32] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[05:06:37] <Cork> that's it
[05:06:42] <edlinde> Ah i see
[05:06:47] <edlinde> thanks
[05:07:33] <bel3atar> can anyone explain to me how the .tagsManager('popTag'); thing works?
[05:08:24] <Cork> bel3atar: you have a plugin that creates a function tagsManager that takes a string as a call for an internal function
[05:08:34] <Cork> bel3atar: you would have to read the plugin to see what it does
[05:09:18] <bel3atar> Cork: I don't get the .something() syntax... What object is it being called on?
[05:09:39] <Cork> do you have $() infront?
[05:09:58] <Cork> the dot means it's a member on something
[05:10:25] <bel3atar> Cork: http://welldonethings.com/tags/manager
[05:10:43] <bel3atar> Cork: where it says You can use the following methods
[05:15:22] <bel3atar> jQuery.fn.tagsManager = function (options,tagToManipulate)
[05:15:38] <bel3atar> what does this mean?
[05:16:54] <bel3atar> $.fn.tagsManager('poptag'); return an empty array
[05:16:56] <bel3atar> returns
[05:17:12] <bel3atar> even if I do have tags
[05:18:39] <thaifood> hi guys
[05:19:16] <Zepo> Someone know a bit about Pear-QuickForm and if it's good with JQery
[05:19:21] <thaifood> How can I simulate a click on the 2nd TD in a TR ?  I have the TR ID.
[05:20:40] <ph88> will $.each()  halt javascript execution when the object which is iterated does not excist ?
[05:22:24] <sahbeewah> ph88, yes
[05:22:55] <ph88> so in that case i should always put such a statement in if-blocks which check if the variable is defined
[05:23:52] <shoky> same as you would if trying to read its .length property
[05:23:53] <sahbeewah> thaifood, $('#tr_id').children('td').eq(1)
[05:24:29] <thaifood> will that simulate a click sahbeewah
[05:24:39] <sahbeewah> thaifood, $('#tr_id').children('td').eq(1).trigger('click')
[05:24:44] <thaifood> ahh
[05:24:50] <thaifood> thanks
[05:26:35] <faraway> ph88: if a certain value for a variable/parameter could cause an error in you script you always should check the correctness of this variable, either with an if, or by using a try cache block.
[05:58:53] <fatduckling> Is there a simple JSFIDDLE where, if you click a button, a div gets hidden.
[05:59:32] <deepy> .hide()
[05:59:48] <fatduckling> i need a fiddle.
[06:20:36] <rafaelsouza3d> Hello there, I need to join #php channel, but I can't
[06:20:43] <rafaelsouza3d> I need an invitation
[06:22:28] <rafaelsouza3d> Is someone here #php member?
[06:22:56] <jost> rafaelsouza3d: I think you simply need to register on freenode
[06:23:18] <jost> (and log in, of course)
[06:23:22] * ruby_on_tails just became a #php member by doing /join #php
[06:24:09] <dan2k3k4> do /j ##php
[06:24:28] <ruby_on_tails> shucks
[06:24:32] <ruby_on_tails> didnt know /j was enough
[06:25:07] <rafaelsouza3d> it doesnt works...
[06:25:26] <rafaelsouza3d> it keeps saying i need an invite
[06:25:31] <dan2k3k4> rafaelsouza3d: you have to be registered/logged in on 'freenode'
[06:25:44] <rafaelsouza3d> gonna check that
[06:25:55] <dan2k3k4> and #php is invite only, but everyone 'logged in' gets redirected to ##php
[06:26:16] <dan2k3k4> similar to #java #mac #windows #linux - I think?
[06:27:46] <drager> Can you in an easy way highlight a word? or rather a paragraph visiting a link? e.g. http://localhost:8000/#P11
[06:31:09] <leonvv> drager: Linking to localhost is useless, has it is only accessible for people on your local network
[06:34:18] <rafaelsouza3d> ok I got it
[06:34:23] <LekeFly-> leonvv: Lies! i can visit 127.0.0.1 anywhere!
[06:34:24] <LekeFly-> :D
[06:34:52] <rafaelsouza3d> I really must be logged to freenode, thank you guys
[06:35:01] <leonvv> LekeFly, that's not the same as localhost ;)
[06:35:47] <fikst> ahh, no place like 127.0.0.1 :)
[06:36:18] <fikst> specialy 127.0.0.1:8000 :p
[06:36:59] <drager> leonvv: That was just an example
[06:37:14] <drager> leonvv: I will ofc use this on a real domain
[06:37:23] <rafaelsouza3d> I didnt have prior experience with IRC, thats it
[06:37:45] <rafaelsouza3d> I'm really impressed how you guys know about localhost ;)
[06:37:48] <xec_> drager: you can select it with css using ":target" or just grab location.hash in js
[06:38:07] <leonvv> drager: CSS will be your best bet
[06:38:26] <xec_> leonvv: localhost is usually an alias for 127.0.0.1
[06:38:52] <rafaelsouza3d> oh yeah
[06:39:21] <drager> okey, thanks guys
[06:39:30] <therealkoopa> Is it possible to grab elements that are created in css using the pseduo :before selector?
[06:40:34] <sl33k_> having problems with $.ajax() here https://forum.jquery.com/topic/dropdown-option-only-setting-selected-after-alert#14737000004078164
[06:40:47] <xec_> therealkoopa: there are some non-standard ways iirc, but essentially: nope
[06:40:48] <sl33k_> would appreciate any help or direction
[06:42:05] <xec_> therealkoopa: depending on what you're trying to do, there might be workarounds though
[06:43:04] <therealkoopa> xec_: I'm setting a div scale transformation to some value, but I don't want the scale to apply to the background image. I tried setting the background image using a pseudo :before selector, with the inverse scale, but I would need to update its scale in JS
[06:43:11] <sl33k_> Its making me tear my hair
[06:43:35] <sl33k_> modified link https://forum.jquery.com/topic/dropdown-option-only-setting-selected-after-alert
[06:44:09] <drager> Can you make the jQuery UI dialog to submit on "enter"?
[06:44:50] <xec_> therealkoopa: if you need to edit the value directly (for some unknown arbitrary value) you probably need two dom elements. if you only need a few different options you could add/remove a class on a parent for preset values set in css
[06:45:40] <therealkoopa> xec_: yea, that's what I'm thinking. I was trying to get around an extra dom element
[06:46:24] <xec_> therealkoopa: of course, the element doesn't need to be present in the html - create it with the script
[06:47:02] <sl33k_> guys any help with this https://forum.jquery.com/topic/dropdown-option-only-setting-selected-after-alert
[06:47:46] <xec_> ?ajax101 @ sl33k_
[06:47:47] <b-ot> sl33k_: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpgand these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[06:59:12] <anew> hey one questoin guys, when i do $('#idState').append($("<option />").text('Select All States'));  how does it know to do <option></option> ? it seems to be doing this, but from i am writing it looks like it should only be doing </option>
[07:01:06] <fikst> anew, <option /> is the same as <option></option>
[07:01:18] <Z3R0> yep ;)
[07:01:22] <fikst> its a self-closing tag
[07:01:25] <Z3R0> many tags can be auto closed with />
[07:01:31] <Z3R0> like <img src="" />
[07:02:09] <Z3R0> why would you auto close an option ?
[07:02:12] <anew> ah
[07:02:16] <anew> so it's auto closing
[07:02:20] <anew> z3r0 this is a bad idea ?
[07:02:33] <Z3R0> no not a bad idea just curious, typically there's text within the option tag...
[07:02:50] <fikst> he's doing $("<option />").text('Select All States')
[07:02:53] <Z3R0> ah
[07:03:03] <Z3R0> yea that works :0
[07:03:21] <fikst> but isn't <option>select all states</option> faster?
[07:03:33] <Z3R0> anything static is faster...
[07:03:34] <anew> u mean in html ?
[07:03:41] <anew> yeah well that's not an option here obv in html
[07:03:46] <fikst> i mean in $('')
[07:04:00] <Z3R0> most likely
[07:04:03] <Z3R0> less functions to go through
[07:04:58] <anew> fikst so you mean
[07:05:10] <anew> well i dont know what u mean... what do u mean  lol
[07:05:30] <Z3R0> he means rather than assigning a text attribute to it, just add it to the dom as a whole
[07:05:37] <fikst> $('#idState').append($("<option>Select all states</option>"));
[07:05:52] <Z3R0> rather than adding an empty option and THEN assigning text
[07:06:04] <anew> an yeah actually i have another line doing that... will just change it all to ur suggestion fikst
[07:06:09] <anew> sorry if i sounded snooty lol
[07:10:43] <sl33k_> xec_: how can I know if the data is gotten. could i use always() ?
[07:11:34] <xec_> sl33k_: .done() should do the trick
[07:12:12] <drager> Can you add a div to a page?
[07:12:19] <xec_> sl33k_: if you need something to happen if it fails, use .fail()
[07:13:11] <xec_> drager: why not, what page do you want it on
[07:13:32] <drager> xec_: I want to add a div into another div
[07:13:37] <drager> if you know what I'm sayin
[07:14:12] <xec_> drager: $(".anotherDiv").append("<div>")
[07:15:12] <xec_> drager: there are plenty of ways http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-insertion-inside/
[07:15:25] <drager> thanks
[07:15:28] <needlz_> would anyone mind having a look at this: if ($('#id_type :selected').val().is('LINK')) {                     alert("got it");                 } ? I'm doing something wrong and don't know what..
[07:16:13] <needlz_> ah found it
[07:16:16] <needlz_> it was the .is()
[07:16:16] <needlz_> :)
[07:16:19] <xec_> needlz_: .is() is a jquery method, but .val() returns the value
[07:16:27] <xec_> (i.e. not a jquery object)
[07:16:36] <needlz_> xec_: thanks a lo
[07:16:37] <needlz_> t
[07:17:29] <xec_> needlz_: if #id_type is a <select> you can do if ($("#id_type").val() === "LINK") { ... }
[07:17:40] <xec_> (no need for the :selected)
[07:22:36] <needlz_> xec_: that's handy, thank you :)
[07:31:13] <houser> Im using ckeditor. I want to listen for key-up events. This works for key-down: $(val).ckeditorGet().on('key', function(e) {}); How do i listen for key-up? This won't work: $(val).ckeditorGet().on('keyup', function(e) {});
[07:31:58] <auspaRamount> I'm going to use a proxy to get around the same origin policy.  Does anyone have suggestions on what to use? keeping in mind that I need to access information behind authenitcation.
[07:33:18] <sl33k> xec_ : could done() be used after success has been used?
[07:34:04] <epantzar> diverdude, should you not do something like this :  "$('.classOfCkeditor').on('keyup', function..."
[07:34:38] <xec_> sl33k: sure, you can have as many callbacks as you want
[07:34:40] <Andrew_R> auspaRamount: whatever your server/language supports, this is more of a backend question
[07:34:50] <xec_> ?tias @ sl33k
[07:34:50] <b-ot> sl33k: Try It And See
[07:35:04] <diverdude> epantzar, mmm no i dont think so...i have tried that on the 'key' event....then it only works on the first instance
[07:35:29] <auspaRamount> thanks Andrew_R; I know it is, but primarily I want to easily operate within jquery. Once I have selected a backend :)
[07:35:33] <epantzar> on the first instance of the ckeditor you mean? Since you have several?
[07:35:37] <diverdude> epantzar, besides it works great on the 'key' event...its just on keydown...i want keyup
[07:36:42] <epantzar> im not sure what you want to achieve or how ckeditor plugin works, but Id say it seems ur selector ur adding the "on"-listener to seems to be wrong
[07:36:54] <Andrew_R> auspaRamount: send back the data from the backend as json, that will be the easiest to work with in jquery
[07:37:51] <auspaRamount> okay :) thanks.  So really not a proxy? more of a jsonp?
[07:39:01] <Andrew_R> auspaRamount: aren't you talking about making the remote calls on your own server (from the backend), and using your own server as a proxy?
[07:39:51] <auspaRamount> yes, sorry, my mistake.

[07:50:36] <b0ss_> is defining $( document ).ready(function() {     // Your code here }); within the <script> tag as the last line of the <body> tag a good practice for performance optimisation ?
[07:54:28] <b0ss__> is defining $( document ).ready(function() {     // Your code here }); within the <script> tag as the last line of the <body> tag a good practice for performance optimisation ?

[07:55:31] <jedimind> rorate how
[07:55:34] <jedimind> rotate*
[07:55:46] <kasperski> jedimind: what do you mean?
[07:56:00] <jedimind> like on which axis
[07:56:07] <jedimind> are you flipping it, rolling it, inverting it
[07:59:56] <b0ss__> is defining $( document ).ready(function() {     // Your code here }); within the <script> tag as the last line of the <body> tag a good practice for performance optimisation ?
[08:02:52] <BillCriswell> b0ss__: It'll make the pages perceived rendering a bit faster.
[08:04:12] <BillCriswell> b0ss__: Also, if you're putting your scripts right before the </body> you don't need the $( document ).ready(function(){}); at all.
[08:04:28] <b0ss__> no?
[08:04:36] <b0ss__> how would it be like so ?
[08:05:20] <BillCriswell> Instead of $( document ).ready(function(){ $('a').addClass('neat'); }); just do $('a').addClass('neat');
[08:06:46] <BillCriswell> I think of it like this, probably way over simplified, but all $(document).ready() does is wait for the code inside <body> to "exist".

[08:15:28] <BillCriswell> theresajayne_: Does it work with just "search/videoplayback/foo"
[08:16:42] <theresajayne_> you mean lose the initial /
[08:16:49] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:18:12] <theresajayne_> nope
[08:18:20] <theresajayne_> its getting as follows http://localhost/search/employer/[object%20Object]
[08:18:55] <b0ss__> why is "$" a factory method ?
[08:19:14] <BillCriswell> theresajayne_: What is link exactly?
[08:21:05] <BillCriswell> Are you sure you don't want a properly of link? like link.url?
[08:22:29] <BillCriswell> property*
[08:22:40] <theresajayne_> the problem i am getting is i had a document.ready which set the width but now because i use other size fancyboxes elsewhere on the page the size is wrong.
[08:22:59] <theresajayne_> so i was trying to get it to work on a click
[08:23:13] <theresajayne_> $('.fancybox').fancybox({              'height':470,             'width':960,             'modal':true         });
[08:29:32] <juboba> Hey
[08:29:35] <theresajayne_> BillCriswell found the problem i had url:/search instead of href: /search
[08:30:13] <BillCriswell> theresajayne_: Ahh, stinks.
[08:30:23] <juboba> I know that it is not possible to request va AJAX content from another domain, but... How then can I get some RSS feed from another server?
[08:30:46] <BillCriswell> src vs href always annoyed me
[08:30:53] <juboba> I could do it server-side using cURL, but I see this as a longer workaround
[08:31:12] <BillCriswell> <script src="foo.js"></script> vs <link href="style.css" type="text/css"> for example
[08:32:02] <BillCriswell> juboba: If the domain doesn't allow cross domain requests you would just need to use cURL probably..
[08:32:37] <juboba> BillCriswell, where should I allow cross domain request?
[08:32:57] <BillCriswell> juboba: The owner of the domain would need to allow it.
[08:33:23] <BillCriswell> If you're the owner of the other one you could look into CORS.
[08:33:39] <juboba> ohh ok
[08:38:31] <b0ss__> .
[08:38:57] <b0ss__> why is "$" a factory method ?
[08:47:36] <tubbo> b0ss__: easy to type and out-of-the-way for most JS code
[08:48:02] <b0ss__> tubbo: I don't get it
[08:50:16] <diverdude> How can i make a blocking .each loop?
[08:50:28] <BillCriswell> b0ss__: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern
[08:50:44] <BillCriswell> I'm linking that because I never know how to explain terminology haha.
[08:51:16] <BillCriswell> diverdude: Are you're not doing anything async in the loop it should be blocking already.
[08:51:45] <BillCriswell> IF you're not*
[08:51:56] <tubbo> b0ss__: what don't you get?
[08:52:02] <sereal-work> If I have a block of jquery that came from a selector, how can I apply another one ontop of that? ( chunk = <div><span class="spanclass">bla</span></div> ) I want to do something like $(chunk).$('.spanclass')
[08:52:24] <b-lew> Can I score some help with this question? http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/96475/show-the-image-specified-in-src
[08:52:26] <tubbo> b0ss__: also could you try two things for me? 1.) stop asking the same question every 30 seconds, and 2.) please ask more specific questions
[08:52:28] <BillCriswell> sereal-work: $(chunk)
[08:52:42] <b0ss__> tubbo: the factory pattern states an abstract class for the actual factory class of a product? Is it only this ?
[08:52:48] <sereal-work> err yeah but how to I append the other selector ontop of that BillCriswell ?
[08:53:14] <BillCriswell> sereal-work: I think you want .add()?
[08:53:36] <diverdude> BillCriswell, ok. its because i need to do something like this funcion(){ flag=0; $('...').each(function(key,val){ flag &= (val=='foobar')}); if(flag) dostuff();})
[08:53:48] <tubbo> b0ss__: heh, well...personally i don't think so. jQuery wraps DOMNode objects that come from JS itself, and from your browser natively. when you select an element with jQuery, it uses the right method to find said DOM object from the page and it wraps that object in a jQuery object, which you can then perform nice methods on like .attr(), .val(), etc.
[08:53:53] <diverdude> BillCriswell, so i need to wait for the each loop to finish before running the if
[08:54:25] <tubbo> b0ss__: so jQuery isn't "making" these DOM elements necessarily (even though it has the capability), it's just wrapping them in a nice object. kinda like a decorator pattern really
[08:54:36] <tubbo> except jQuery offers so much more than a simple cross-browser decoration of DOM elements.
[08:54:40] <ShaunR> I'm attempting to use ajax to get the same page i'm on but i only want a section of the page (specifically the section with id="stuff"), how can i do this.   I've got it working now where it grabs the hole body because of context: document.body but i'm not sure how to specify just that id
[08:54:43] <BillCriswell> diverdude: That should be blocking.
[08:55:37] <sereal-work> well I want to do something like $(chunk).children().('.spanclass') and have it return just the span class.
[08:56:17] <BillCriswell> sereal-work: $(chunk).find('.spanclass')
[08:56:31] <sereal-work> thanks, find was what I was looking for.
[08:56:36] <BillCriswell> diverdude: http://jsbin.com/esiyuq/1/edit
[08:56:40] <sereal-work> brain fart :p
[08:56:49] <BillCriswell> haha happens.
[08:57:33] <thaifood> I'm trying to get add a tooltip (title) attribute with no luck if anyone can take a quick look please.  http://fpaste.org/3FzI/
[08:57:53] <diverdude> BillCriswell, hmm why is that example not just outputting true?
[08:58:31] <BillCriswell> You mean the init?
[08:58:36] <diamonds> is there a 1 page list of all jquery supported CSS selectors?
[08:58:46] <diamonds> like the normal ones + whatever jquery polyfills or adds
[08:59:11] <diamonds> and can I supply a regex for an attrib value
[08:59:11] <BillCriswell> diamonds: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ I guess.
[08:59:20] <Transcended> Hey guys.  I have a .class that, when clicked, performs some action.  This element also contains an ID, which I use to manipulate the DOM in certain ways.  Now, when I load this element into the DOM manually, I want to fire the click event on that particular element, however, because the jquery handler is written against the class, it doesn't get called.  How do you typically handle this...
[08:59:22] <Transcended> ...type of behavior?
[08:59:30] <diamonds> yeah... I'm looking at that page BillCriswell
[08:59:35] <BillCriswell> diamonds: You can use .filter() with a regex.
[09:00:04] <diamonds> BillCriswell: like data-123=/a|b|c/ ?
[09:00:48] <BillCriswell> $('span').filter(function(){ return /^[a-c]/.test(this.className); }).addClass('classname-starts-with-a-through-c')
[09:01:26] <BillCriswell> diamonds: Don't beieve you could use it like that.
[09:01:30] <diamonds> ahhh tahnk you
[09:02:51] <BillCriswell> No problem diamonds.
[09:06:36] <motaka2> hello - I wonder why ticker-container does not work on this page: http://fa.noondreams.com/%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87/  but it works on local server
[09:09:10] <thaifood> Anyone good with setting a tooltip?  I'm trying to get add a tooltip (title) attribute with no luck if anyone can take a quick look please.  http://fpaste.org/3FzI/
[09:10:13] <theresajayne_> thaifood its easy
[09:10:28] <tubbo> thaifood: i think the title="" has to be set already before the tooltip() plugin is called
[09:12:58] <b-lew> Any help on this would be great! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16108642/show-the-image-specified-in-src
[09:12:58] <theresajayne_> this is how we do it http://jsfiddle.net/U748U/
[09:13:19] <theresajayne_> thaifood http://jsfiddle.net/U748U/
[09:16:54] <thaifood> you do that to create a tooltip ?
[09:17:19] <thaifood> thanks
[09:29:36] <KyleSmith> What do I do in regards to the unload function as it was depreciated in 1.8. What is the fix / patch for this?
[09:30:35] <KyleSmith> nvm
[09:30:38] <KyleSmith> Got it working :)
[09:44:04] <Bower^Work> anyone have experience with the blueimp file uploader? i'm having a play with the example provided but can't see where one specifies where the request is sent? i assumed it was the "action" attribute of the form, which works with a simple example i've crafted myself, but unable to get it working with the default
[09:44:13] <Bower^Work> any advice would be much appreciated
[09:45:53] <Bower^Work> no worries..i've found where it is specified (main.js that gets included)
[09:51:08] <davidmahoney> Hey i have a question
[09:51:27] <davidmahoney> so I have to use insertBefore
[09:51:35] <davidmahoney> with echo from php
[09:52:15] <davidmahoney> in a loop that calls different say activities the probelm that I have is that it add the same div over and over
[09:52:47] <draginx> Why would keypress trigger twice?
[09:52:48] <draginx> when I have *absolutely* nothing else triggering that element
[09:57:06] <LaMakina>  did you attach the eventhandler twice ?
[09:58:49] <draginx> LaMakina: nope
[09:58:53] <draginx> is there a way to see if I did though?
[09:58:58] <draginx> without looking athte code
[09:59:04] <draginx> like imagine 400 JS files for one app :P
[09:59:13] <chinoto> oh dear god
[09:59:30] <draginx> chinoto: not my project
[09:59:30] <chinoto> jsmin and concatenate, PLEASE!
[09:59:38] <draginx> obv but i need to solve problems first
[09:59:59] <chinoto> but keep the concatenations under 25KiB, otherwise iphones get a stick up their *
[10:00:32] <draginx> this website does not need to support mobile in anyway
[10:00:48] <say2joe> draginx: you can overwrite the default event handler with a function that includes a logger and call to the "old" eventhandler
[10:02:15] <draginx> say2joe: ill try it thanks :)
[10:08:41] <Kraytul> does $.hasClass(Str) support regexing?
[10:09:18] <LaMakina> not according to http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[10:10:04] <Kraytul> I read that but it didn't specify one way or another particularly.
[10:10:34] <Kraytul> It doesn't give details as to how the search for the string is done, so I figured it was possible it regex'd it.
[10:10:55] <LaMakina> it expects a string not a regexp
[10:11:11] <LaMakina> but you can trying to search tobj.className
[10:11:21] <LaMakina> obj.className.match(....
[10:11:34] <Kraytul> Ooo
[10:12:15] <LaMakina> see what i mean ?
[10:17:24] <Kraytul> mmhmm

[10:26:32] <jeremyabel> hello jquery friends
[10:26:42] <jeremyabel> http://brandonaaron.net/code/mousewheel/demos so, is anyone else able to run this demo in firefox?
[10:26:48] <chinoto> I am going to have many dynamically generated form on the same page, each one will come with it's own custom function that I use to tell it what it's container element is and some values to preload itself with. Does anyone have a better idea than this: Put a function into an attribute on an element, then query for the element and eval the attribute, then call the eval'ed function with the arguments.
[10:27:01] <chinoto> sl33k_: still at it?
[10:27:18] <sl33k_> chinoto: sadly yes
[10:27:41] <chinoto> post a link to the latest broken code
[10:28:12] <sl33k_> chinoto: would jsfiddle be ok?
[10:28:20] <sl33k_> http://jsfiddle.net/Rbgmm/4/
[10:32:27] <jeremyabel> http://brandonaaron.net/code/mousewheel/demos is anybody able to get this guy to go in firefox?
[10:35:43] <chinoto> sl33k_: I've been preferring jsbin recently, it's less rigid, whatever you do is fine.
[10:39:14] <elrond255> How do you use attr() to set attributes that have no value like allowfullscreen, controls or preload for video tags?
[10:39:32] <davidmahoney> hey jquery question how can I insert text before a class
[10:39:45] <davidmahoney> $('.activity-inner').Before('hello');
[10:39:57] <davidmahoney> I thought it would be that
[10:41:16] <jan_n> davidmahoney: well, it should be. I suppose you checked out this page http://api.jquery.com/before/
[10:41:22] <davidmahoney> ya
[10:41:50] <jan_n> and I suppose you didn't use "Before" when you meant "before" ?
[10:43:44] <davidmahoney> oh thanks somtimes you need another pair of eys
[10:43:49] <chinoto> elrond255: I think you want to figure out what the property is unless something depends on the attribute, I believe boolean attributes generally are either "selected" or "selected='selected'", so you could probably just say "$(...).attr(myattr,myattr)"
[10:44:24] <jan_n> davidmahoney: you could also use jslint ;)
[10:45:25] <davidmahoney> what is that?
[10:46:24] <davidmahoney> is there a way you can encorporate that in netbeans or something
[10:46:41] <davidmahoney> that is my biggest peeve about javascript the syntax detection
[10:47:15] <elrond255> chinoto:  the ones I listed do not have a glue I could find... Allowfullscreen doesn't have a value and won't work if I add one. If I can't d out with jQuery then I have a workaround, but it's kinda frustrating
[10:48:55] <davidmahoney> is there a way to check if there is text before a div
[10:49:26] <chinoto> elrond255: take a look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2428295/1524693
[10:49:31] <sereal-work> davidmahoney, grab the outter element and parse for it. There is probably a more elegant jquery way though.
[10:49:45] <chinoto> it isn't the same attribute, but I believe the concept will apply
[10:49:58] <davidmahoney> ya there has to be
[10:50:23] <sereal-work> the answer probably is to put that text into a selector
[10:50:35] <ali4ever4> why jquery 2.0 not supporting ie 6 7 and specially 8 , i thought the main power of jquery was that it makes javascript run the semiller way in all browsers
[10:50:54] <nicetry> I'm trying to have my JS know when I click the first link in a set of links -- here is my code - http://jsfiddle.net/QqvAK/ - can't figure out why it's always false
[10:51:08] <elrond255> chinoto:  is attr('name', '') the same as an attribute without a value?
[10:51:26] <BlaqJim> hi
[10:51:42] <rthor> yup
[10:51:49] <ryanneufeld> emu: ping
[10:51:55] <BillCriswell> nicetry: $('div a').first().on('click', function(){ // Woooo });
[10:52:10] <BillCriswell> or $('div a:eq(0)').on('click'
[10:52:50] <nicetry> BillCriswell: Check out my code, I'm trying to figure out what's wrong wiht my logic
[10:52:51] <BillCriswell> $('div a').eq(0).on('click', .. ); as well.
[10:53:01] <chinoto> elrond255: the link I sent you was using true for the value...
[10:53:24] <nicetry> In firebug the two elements I'm selecting are equal, not sure why jquery doesn't think so
[10:53:25] <jan_n> davidmahoney: probably.
[10:53:32] <davidmahoney> I was think about putting the text into a selctor
[10:53:36] <jan_n> davidmahoney: http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/40893/jslint
[10:54:32] <nicetry> BillCriswell: Do you see what I mean?
[10:54:37] <davidmahoney> this is my probelm I pulling text from a database and I need to appear before a certain div but it is in a loop so all the data appears instead the only one I want
[10:54:54] <davidmahoney> does that make sense
[10:55:08] <jan_n> no.
[10:55:17] <jan_n> but make an jsfiddle of it and it will.
[10:55:34] <davidmahoney> I can't it is using a db
[10:55:53] <jan_n> you can always fake it for the example.
[10:58:26] <chinoto> sl33k_: so what you want is when someone opens the select, it sends off a request for the options and populates the select with them?!?
[10:58:33] <davidmahoney> so I have a activity loop that is run by buddypress and I want to add a title to the activity I have it saving everything is fine but in the activity loop I grab the title and insert it before the content the problem through the loop it calls before each time so I get title1,title2,title3,etc for each activity instead just the title for that activity
[10:58:39] <BillCriswell> nicetry: Yes.
[10:58:56] <davidmahoney> okay I think that makes sense
[10:59:13] <vinici> so, anyone here knows a good jquery modal plugin?
[10:59:13] <BillCriswell> nicetry: When you click it you're adding the selected class. That would make things weird.
[10:59:24] <vinici> i just want to made customized messages within a modal dialog
[10:59:25] <davidmahoney> I have to check if there is something there than over write what is there
[10:59:29] <vinici> but all those plugins are crappy
[10:59:40] <nicetry> BillCriswell: we can take that out, its not important to this/leftover code from when I simplified it for jsfiddle
[10:59:51] <sl33k_> chinoto: and before click what was selected must remain selected while other options populate
[10:59:56] <nicetry> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/QqvAK/17/
[10:59:58] <BillCriswell> Are you just trying to see if you clicked the first link?
[11:00:36] <nicetry> BillCriswell: Yes, I'm trying to see that I clicked the first link set of links contained in var allLinks
[11:00:53] <chinoto> sl33k_: why on earth would you do this? why not preload the select and be done with it?
[11:01:01] <elrond255> chinoto:  I figured it out, thanks :-)
[11:01:18] <chinoto> elrond255: yay!
[11:01:21] <b0ss_> I manage to save data sent from my form but can't refresh a div with the results. Here's my code: http://jsbin.com/evoqim/1/edit
[11:01:54] <ali4ever4> why jquery 2.0 don't support ie 6  7  8 i thought the main power of jquery is it makes things work similler on different browsers specially the ones that are far from standards
[11:02:12] <nicetry> The first link in the* set of links containe d in var allLinks
[11:02:53] <chinoto> ali4ever4: they are old/barely functional browsers, they need to be abandoned
[11:03:01] <sl33k_> chinoto: If you see my HTML I am getting value from Java session. In html tag it gets selected. After that on click event, I populate dropdown which brings in options from db including this selected one.
[11:03:21] <sereal-work> nicetry: http://jsfiddle.net/QqvAK/22/
[11:03:49] <sl33k_> To make more sense we are implementing update functionality by which we update profile
[11:04:56] <ali4ever4> chinoto, i know and i would be the most happy guy when all ie browsers die , in fact i want IE to be and extented species of browsers , but the bad fact is they are still there and ie8 is kind of still domenating with lots of non IT windows users  so its important to support it
[11:05:36] <chinoto> ali4ever4: just use the migrate library
[11:05:38] <nicetry> sereal-work: Thats neat - I see what you did there - but I have two issues. 1) what if I don't want to be comparing the text of the link .  2) I'd like to understand why my example didn't work, what did I do wrong with the object comparison
[11:06:10] <chinoto> ali4ever4: or an old version of jquery
[11:07:14] <ali4ever4> chinoto, migrate library ? what is this ?
[11:07:19] <chinoto> sl33k_: not sure if you'll like it, but I found a fix.
[11:07:29] <chinoto> sl33k_: http://jsbin.com/abobag/1/edit
[11:07:36] <chinoto> use one instead of on
[11:08:02] <sereal-work> I would use a unique selector for them. Give them an id, or look at the actual link. I'm not sure what is wrong with your compare code. I think the 'this' is something different than what you were comparing it to. Their memory space is different. Someone please correct me if i'm wrong.
[11:08:05] <sl33k_> chinoto: I am using one after updating it http://jsfiddle.net/Rbgmm/9/
[11:08:15] <chinoto> sl33k_: it will only fire once, but your database shouldn't be changing every three seconds so it shouldn't be a problem.
[11:08:19] <BillCriswell> nicetry: Never used index like this. I came up with this.. think it's pretty clear: http://jsfiddle.net/QqvAK/23/
[11:08:49] <sereal-work> BillCriswell, whats preventDefault?
[11:08:57] <BillCriswell> Stops from following the link.
[11:09:06] <sereal-work> ah
[11:09:22] <sl33k_> chinoto: not working. somedone suggested .done() that too does not yield results
[11:09:39] <chinoto> sl33k_: it works fine for me
[11:09:41] <sereal-work> nicetry, use BillCriswell example. It's far more elegant.
[11:10:00] <chinoto> oh I see
[11:11:52] <sl33k_> chinoto: Ms should not get selected. Sri should
[11:13:09] <sl33k_> chinoto: after clicking that is
[11:13:58] <sl33k_> asked here too http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16109032/setting-selected-value-after-ajax-call-only-works-after-alert . the answer ha some syntactic error it seems
[11:14:10] <b0ss_> I manage to save data sent from my form but can't refresh a div with the results. Here's my code: http://jsbin.com/evoqim/1/edit
[11:14:35] <chinoto> sl33k_: http://jsbin.com/abobag/2/edit
[11:15:13] <chinoto> sl33k_: but really you should just preload it on the server before sending the page to the user
[11:15:45] <sl33k_> chinoto: wow man. works like a charm
[11:15:45] <chinoto> sl33k_: http://jsbin.com/abobag/3/edit
[11:16:45] <chinoto> sl33k_: just curious, why can't this select be filled by the server before the page is even sent to the user?
[11:16:55] <sl33k_> chinoto: how could preloading on the server be done?
[11:17:25] <chinoto> I'm sorry but that has got to be the dumbest question I have ever heard...
[11:18:06] <chinoto> <select><option value='1'>Text</option></select>
[11:18:11] <BillCriswell> http://bukk.it/alsohowiwritejavascripts.gif I'm not sure anything has made me laugh as hard as this.
[11:18:39] <sl33k_> I understand. but there are many dropdowns like country , state
[11:19:34] <sl33k_> for instance state depends on country to get its value. so ajax will be required to make some computations
[11:19:43] <chinoto> sl33k_: I can understand city and maybe state being ajaxed if you have many thousands of values
[11:20:17] <chinoto> sl33k_: not really, you can send that data in the first request
[11:20:31] <chinoto> I actually do a hybrid
[11:21:14] <sl33k_> sounds plausible
[11:21:19] <chinoto> how many cities do you have in total?
[11:21:54] <nicetry> BillCriswell:  and sereal-work  - thank you,  I have a more complicated environment then what I jsfiddled, but I was able to apply what you put, i'm comparing the indexs now so  if (allLinks.index(currentLink) == allLinks.index(allLinks.first()))
[11:21:58] <sl33k_> dont know actual figure. but somewhere around 500
[11:22:09] <nicetry> so numbers == numbers no problem
[11:22:09] <sl33k_> chinoto: ^
[11:22:30] <nicetry> Still don't know why jquery object !== same jquery object
[11:23:13] <davidmahoney> okay I have function that document.ready that gets ran multiple in a php loop
[11:23:27] <davidmahoney> is there anyway to have a function only run once
[11:23:53] <chinoto> sl33k_: doesn't seem too huge, I guess it could be a problem
[11:24:11] <chinoto> sl33k_: but states should be nothing if you have 500 cities
[11:24:34] <chinoto> how many countries and states?
[11:25:13] <sl33k_> chinoto: don' know now. not at work
[11:25:15] <BillCriswell> nicetry: http://jsfiddle.net/QqvAK/24/ seems to be working.
[11:25:52] <nicetry> BillCriswell: yeah we're good, thank you for your help!
[11:25:58] <chinoto> sl33k_: this is how I do my hybrid approach: http://www.bpaste.net/show/s8EAyuKbOIoSlXcU3v8D/
[11:26:06] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[11:26:34] <chinoto> some bits are missing, shouldn't be too hard to piece it together though
[11:29:01] <sl33k_> chinoto: looks cool and I appreciate your help. can't thank you enough.
[11:29:20] <chinoto> sl33k_: I need to get some work done, but really consider including all these options in the page request itself rather than ajax, in php you could just say "states=<?=json_encode($states)?>"
[11:30:09] <sl33k_> will look into that link
[11:32:07] <b0ss_> is there an option in $.post in case the function doesn't succeed ?
[11:32:47] <BillCriswell> b0ss_: error I believe.
[11:34:20] <BillCriswell> b0ss_: $.post('/form').done(function(){ console.log('Worked!') }).fail(function(){ console.log('Dammit'); });
[11:34:53] <b0ss_> Thanks!!
[11:39:35] <b-lew> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16108642/show-the-image-specified-in-src?noredirect=1#comment23006361_16108642-> am trying to fix this issue. I have a live link if that helps too.
[12:00:32] <Z3R0> what's the difference between VAR and $VAR ?
[12:01:44] <NoiseEee> Z3R0: nothing, but some people use the latter to indicate it represents a jquery object.
[12:01:54] <chinoto> I asked if dom ready was necessary before I went to sleep at 4am (...), I believe I was told that as long as the end tag of an element is before the start tag of the script, then you will be able to select the element. I just did a bit of testing and it seems that, in Firefox at least, you can select elements as soon as you open them (ie the script is inside the element). This was my test:
[12:01:54] <chinoto> <script>console.log($('html,head,body,header,#header,input[name="query"],#header_nav,#body').map(function() {return (this.id||this.name||this.tagName);}).get());</script>
[12:02:34] <chinoto> So is this recommendation based on the behavior of other/older browsers?
[12:16:35] <chinoto> Just did the test on a coworker's computer using IE9 and it's compatibility modes. As long as the script occurs after the open tag of an element, the script can see it... I should see what innerhtml returns
[12:21:39] <chinoto> this returns from just after the opening tag of the last element found, up to the end of the script or element, whichever comes first
[12:21:39] <chinoto> <script>console.log($($('html,head,body,header,#header,input[name="query"],#header_nav,#body').get(-1)).map(function() {return this.innerHTML;}).get());</script>
[12:22:43] <chinoto> could be useful to know if you have a huge element that could take a while to process and you want to run some javascript on the element itself before all that
[12:25:48] <tvw> short question: does support jQuery 2.0 touch events and mobile devices?
[12:34:16] <profligacy> Are there any good beginner's tutorials on JQuery?

[12:34:51] <abjorn> On my phone so no direct link
[12:36:59] <Krambiorix> hi , on a div jquery somewhere puts a left value of -800 px which cause the problem that i don't see the div on the screen. How can i check where in the code this setting of the left value occurs?
[12:37:07] <edlinde__> I want to make an interface very similar to google maps , so was wondering how I can have the side section
[12:37:10] <edlinde__> using a table?
[12:37:17] <edlinde__> or is it better to use DIVs?
[12:39:02] <chinoto> edlinde__: some people have a hate of tables, but until you can get at least what tables off without a ton of extra code, I think tables are the way to go when it's easier.
[12:39:11] <NoiseEee> side section?
[12:39:13] <chinoto> s/off/offer/
[12:39:36] <Raydiation> how do i focus different scroll areas? focus() doesnt seem to work
[12:39:44] <chinoto> but you can probably get what you want without a table, just need to think about it a bit
[12:39:59] <amph1bius> http://jsbin.com/iqecup/1/edit
[12:40:12] <amph1bius> simple javascript question, how do i alert the name in the box
[12:40:21] <edlinde__> chinoto: I am building a demo project with just a single webpage but if its going to be on different browsers then I don't want them having troubles due to different resolutions
[12:41:07] <chinoto> I just wanted to say my piece, I got work to do :/
[12:42:00] <edlinde__> k
[12:42:09] <edlinde__> just thought there would be a FW to do such a thing
[12:42:52] <say2joe> amph1bius: you need to add jQuery (Add Library)
[12:43:05] <say2joe> I'm assuming, since you're in this room, that you want to use jQuery.
[12:43:57] <losted> Hi all, my jQuery.inArray() always return -1 wether the value is in the array or not.. anyone have an idea why it could be like so?
[12:45:48] <dcherman> losted: can you make a ?demo
[12:47:05] <losted> dcherman: ill try
[12:47:57] <say2joe> amph1bius: amph1bius
[12:48:05] <say2joe> amph1bius: http://jsbin.com/iqecup/2/edit
[12:50:05] <losted> dcherman: http://jsfiddle.net/mjWcR/
[12:51:16] <dcherman> losted: sure.  your array is full of strings, and you're searching for an integer.  of course it's always gonna return -1
[12:51:24] <losted> yeah, just realized it..
[12:51:29] <losted> damn
[12:53:00] <losted> thanks anyway dcherman !
[12:57:08] <Raydiation> i want that i can use page down on the second div when i click the link: http://jsfiddle.net/SemKD/
[12:59:00] <profligacy> /wc
[13:01:38] <Krambiorix> how can i open a dialog in a parent window?
[13:06:29] <tubbo> hi all, i'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how promises
[13:06:30] <tubbo> work
[13:06:54] <Raydiation> tubbo: its very easy
[13:07:17] <Raydiation> a promise is basically registering a callback
[13:07:55] <tubbo> right, but i think i screwed up :)
[13:08:08] <tubbo> maybe i need to RTFM but here's my code https://gist.github.com/5422876
[13:08:17] <rupee> bloop
[13:08:44] <tubbo> Raydiation: i'm of the understanding that _renderForm() should be called when the ajax:success event is fired
[13:08:47] <tubbo> but it isn't
[13:08:51] <tubbo> however, i see the ajax request take place.
[13:09:47] <Raydiation> tubbo: iirc theres a .done() method right?
[13:10:07] <tubbo> hmm, maybe :)
[13:10:15] <Raydiation> if the ajax request finished before done() is being called, the thing in done is executed immediately
[13:10:24] <Raydiation> otherwise it saves the callback
[13:10:24] <LekeFly> is this correct: http://pastebin.com/fw8CkP3L?
[13:10:44] <Raydiation> tubbo: then after the ajax request is finished it checks if there are any done callbacks and executes them
[13:11:06] <tubbo> and it's fail() too :)
[13:11:27] <tubbo> Raydiation: right, like it's the same thing as just defining the methods in the hash of $.ajax or equivelant
[13:11:28] <Raydiation> works in the same way
[13:12:29] <tubbo> Raydiation: ok so i updated the gist with the new done/fail syntax but i still get the same results: async request made, no content displayed.
[13:12:39] <tubbo> i see the content i want in the Response though
[13:12:45] <davidmahoney> anyone know about gmap3
[13:13:12] <Raydiation> tubbo: sec
[13:13:44] <Raydiation> i suppose @_renderForm is a method right?
[13:14:13] <Raydiation> can you try: response.fail => @_renderForm()
[13:14:17] <tubbo> Raydiation: yes
[13:14:34] <Raydiation> i think youre overwriting the function
[13:14:38] <Raydiation> which isnt working
[13:14:50] <Raydiation> because the function saves the callback inside the object
[13:15:19] <Raydiation> just a guess though, i use angularjs for those things :D
[13:15:24] <Raydiation> and you should too ;D
[13:15:40] <davidmahoney> anyone know gmap3 sorry I am trying to get clicking work well I have it working but I don't how to identify which marker is being pressed or how to identify the elements in the marker
[13:15:51] <tubbo> Raydiation: thanks but no thanks. i prefer writing as much boilerplate as possible ;)
[13:17:18] <tubbo> Raydiation: but yeah i think i'm just gonna go back to overriding the success/failure functions in $.ajax itself
[13:19:53] <edlinde__> if my server sends back a JSON string, is it possible to parse it using jquery and then display the elements in a DIV ?
[13:20:03] <Raydiation> tubbo: :/
[13:20:11] <edlinde__> wondering if there are good examples of how to do so ? am a newbie to jquery
[13:20:20] <Raydiation> edlinde: yes its very easy
[13:20:43] <Raydiation> $.post(url, data, function(yourJson){ // do something });
[13:22:16] <Raydiation> edlinde__: also i think the $.post docs have most likely something
[13:24:06] <Krambiorix> how can i open a dialog in a parent window?
[13:24:40] <edlinde__> Raydiation: so if I have a form with textfields how do I send data?
[13:25:04] <edlinde__> I mean the data in post must be sent in some certain form yeah?
[13:25:21] <Raydiation> edlinde__: yeah, jquery does that for you
[13:25:30] <Raydiation> url-encoded
[13:25:33] <Raydiation> or how its called
[13:25:42] <Sna4x8> Krambiorix: window.opener.[your-function-that-opens-a-dialog]();
[13:25:49] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: window.parent
[13:26:25] <edlinde__> Raydiation: the post docs look good. they have a form in the end as an example
[13:26:29] <raj> click events bubble up from the deepest part of the DOM upwards, right?
[13:26:30] <werle> edlinde__: Have you looked into FormData? http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-XMLHttpRequest2-20100907/
[13:26:33] <Raydiation> edlinde__: id simply use a button that reads out all form elements on click and send it to the server
[13:26:38] <Raydiation> cool :)
[13:26:41] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, Sna4x8 , i have all code to open the dialog (fetch data....) in an iframe. In that iframe i want to open a dialog that can be seen in the top window (over all iframes);
[13:27:18] <werle> raj: correct, unless you stop propagation
[13:27:40] <edlinde__> Raydiation: I thought jquery does that for you automatically when you post a form?
[13:27:58] <Raydiation> edlinde__: could be :)
[13:28:00] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: then call a function in the parent window that does that, just pass it the data
[13:28:03] <Raydiation> never needed that functionality
[13:28:09] <NoiseEee> parent.window.myFunction(theData)
[13:28:11] <Sna4x8> Krambiorix: What NoiseEee said should work fine then, provided the iframe is on the same domain.
[13:28:16] <edlinde__> Raydiation: I am just guessing I don't know
[13:28:38] <raj> werle, so I only need `closest` and I do not need `find`?
[13:28:52] <werle> edlinde__: Have you looked into .serialize() ?
[13:28:52] <raj> to check if my element was in the path
[13:29:00] <raj> of the bubble
[13:29:06] <edlinde__> werle: no
[13:29:22] <Krambiorix> Sna4x8, NoiseEee the form in the dialog is shown in the iframe where it was opened, and the other iframe turns blank
[13:29:45] <edlinde__> werle: is there a good sample code that shows how I can post a form and then parse the JSON string returned?
[13:29:49] <werle> raj: I'm not sure
[13:29:53] <Krambiorix> in the dialog there are some function calls that i want to keep
[13:30:04] <werle> edlinde__: JSON response from the server?
[13:30:09] <edlinde__> yes
[13:30:16] <edlinde__> I am reading the last section in http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[13:30:23] <edlinde__> but its not using serialize
[13:30:52] <edlinde__> I am assuming the .serialize() is to serialise the form inputs to send to .post in the data field?
[13:30:55] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: make a mockup, its impossible to decipher your situation
[13:30:59] <edlinde__> is that right werle ?
[13:31:05] <Krambiorix> okay
[13:32:01] <werle> edlinde__: jQuery.post('path/to/server', {someKey: "someValue"}, function(data) { //do something with data })
[13:32:05] <werle> Have a look here too
[13:32:07] <werle> http://stackoverflow.com/a/5603151/1408668
[13:32:25] <werle> An example for converting fields in a form to an object
[13:32:32] <edlinde__> werle: then where do you use .serialize()?
[13:34:13] <werle> edlinde__: I guess you wouldn't in this case because you would be making a POST
[13:34:22] <werle> http://jsbin.com/alohaq/1/
[13:34:33] <werle> ^ from jQuery's serialize example
[13:35:12] <werle> Convert the fields to an object and use the object as the value to the data property for your post with $.ajax or $.post
[13:36:13] <edlinde__> werle: just wondering on the server side if accessing them as param(field_name) will still work?
[13:36:54] <werle> edlinde__: What are you running for a server?
[13:37:01] <edlinde__> Dancer in perl
[13:37:07] <werle> It will work if you do what I said
[13:37:10] <werle> It "should"
[13:37:24] <edlinde__> werle: so what about the last example in  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ ?
[13:37:27] <edlinde__> is that no good?
[13:37:33] <edlinde__> can you please check it for a sec?
[13:38:07] <werle> $.post("test.php", { "func": "getNameAndTime" },
[13:38:08] <werle>   function(data){
[13:38:08] <werle>     console.log(data.name); // John
[13:38:08] <werle>     console.log(data.time); //  2pm
[13:38:08] <werle>   }, "json");
[13:38:08] <werle> ?
[13:38:34] <edlinde__> no
[13:38:46] <BillCriswell> edlinde__: A div sounds good.
[13:38:49] <edlinde__> there is an example after that
[13:39:01] <BillCriswell> edlinde__: Er.. didnt' scroll down. Sorry about that.
[13:39:04] <edlinde__> werle: do you see the full HTML form
[13:39:32] <edlinde__> it seemed to look elegant to me
[13:42:42] <Raydiation> any idea why the link does not focus the other scrollable div? http://jsfiddle.net/SemKD/
[13:42:58] <Raydiation> when i use page down it goes down in the first div
[13:43:19] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, Sna4x8 i don't think it's possible what i want
[13:48:45] <KyleSmith> Will $(window).unload(function(){ be called if it is reloaded via javascript still?
[13:49:03] <NoiseEee> unload in general is untrustworthy
[13:49:09] <KyleSmith> ie: window.setTimeout('location.reload()', 2000);
[13:49:15] <KyleSmith> I need it though ;p
[13:49:36] <NoiseEee> KyleSmith: well its not guaranteed to work, but go for it, and yes, it should be called under that circumstance.
[13:49:49] <KyleSmith> Is there any alternitives?
[13:49:56] <NoiseEee> onBeforeUnload
[13:50:12] <KyleSmith> okay
[13:50:15] <KyleSmith> ty
[13:50:47] <fRAiLtY-> Is there a jquery-ui item that allows for say, a line of text "This is text" you click on it, and like a ui hover text box opens in with that text in, you type new text and like a "save" button, then it replaces the text. Like a "live" editor

[13:51:31] <edlinde_> werle: thats ok
[13:51:34] <BillCriswell> Raydiation: Hmmm..
[13:51:55] <werle> edlinde_: I see the example
[13:52:09] <edlinde_> look ok to you? :)
[13:53:01] <werle> edlinde_: It does
[13:55:10] <BillCriswell> Raydiation: http://jsfiddle.net/SemKD/2/ works.
[13:55:28] <BillCriswell> At least in Chrome.
[13:55:39] <Raydiation> BillCriswell: cool :)
[13:55:41] <Raydiation> thanks
[13:55:46] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[13:55:51] <Raydiation> any idea?
[13:56:05] <Raydiation> whats the difference between focus() and trigger('focus')
[13:56:17] <BillCriswell> Raydiation: I think the trick was the tabindex="-1" attribute
[13:56:43] <BillCriswell> .focus() works just fine. I was just trying a bunch of randoms stuff before that.
[13:56:45] <werle> Raydiation: I don't think there is one
[13:57:55] <Raydiation> ok weird
[13:57:57] <Raydiation> didnt work for me
[13:58:02] <werle> .focus() ?
[13:58:12] <BillCriswell> Raydiation: Did you have the tabindex="-1" on #two?
[13:58:28] <Raydiation> BillCriswell: no
[13:58:32] <Raydiation> does it the magic?
[13:58:36] <BillCriswell> Raydiation: Yes.
[13:58:42] <Raydiation> haha fml
[13:59:08] <BillCriswell> That's why I said "I think the trick was the tabindex="-1""
[13:59:12] <BillCriswell> ;)
[13:59:24] <Raydiation> BillCriswell: overread :)
[13:59:45] <Netbulae> hello. Is this a support chat or is this jquery dev chat?
[14:00:17] <werle> Netbulae: I'm sure it can be both
[14:00:57] <BillCriswell> Netbulae: This is support. dev would be #jquery-dev
[14:01:10] <BillCriswell> I lurk in there... but I dare not speak.
[14:01:38] <Netbulae> true, I was wondering, because there is so much info online in google and therefore I thought it was kinda weird
[14:02:03] <Netbulae> and if there would be a community.. then every webdeveloper on this planet is already in it
[14:02:15] <Netbulae> so then I thought... hmm this must be dev
[14:02:49] <BillCriswell> You're free to ask questions here.
[14:03:14] <Netbulae> no there is nothing to ask. It's so damn easy
[14:03:24] <Netbulae> Im just window shopping irc channels
[14:03:48] <Netbulae> These are on my list   #html5    #whatwg    #gruntjs    #yeoman    ##javascript    #jquery    #angularjs    #requirejs    #node.js    #css    #httpd    #svg    #webgl    #webrtc
[14:04:15] <BillCriswell> Looks fun.
[14:04:15] <Netbulae> I noticed that there are loads of ppl in here, but it's quite quiet.
[14:04:29] <BillCriswell> Netbulae: I rarely see it quiet in here haha.
[14:04:33] <Netbulae> must be because it's well documented and talked about
[14:04:52] <Netbulae> BillCriswell  what are you doing in here if I may ask?
[14:05:18] <BillCriswell> Helping out where I can to keep myself sidetracked from the boring work I need to do for my real job.
[14:05:21] <Netbulae> support or spending time?
[14:05:47] <Netbulae> might be more options.. but I still have the well documented jquery in mind
[14:06:15] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure what you mean.
[14:06:45] <emu> when saving selected elements for repeated use is there benefits to saving as a child of the window or document as opposed to just a [global] variable?
[14:07:40] <emu> eg using window.form = $("form"); vs var $form = $("form");
[14:07:42] <Netbulae> ah nevermind. Im off to the next room.
[14:07:46] <Netbulae> have fun ppl
[14:07:50] <werle> cheers
[14:07:55] <BillCriswell> Interesting guy.
[14:08:07] <fikst> :)
[14:09:10] <fikst> emu, global vars are saved on the window object
[14:09:21] <fikst> so window object and 'global' are the same
[14:09:47] <emu> ok and vs local objects?
[14:09:51] <emu> with var.
[14:10:21] <werle> BillCriswell: he was an irc nomad
[14:10:24] <[fields]> I have a page that uses jQuery tabs.  I decided to put a google map (api3) on this page, but not within a tab.  All tabs break and the map doesn't render either.  Does anyone have some knowledge why this is happening/how to resolve?
[14:10:25] <fikst> 'local' var are 'saved' in the scope of its function
[14:10:31] <sirspazzolot> so I think I may have tracked down the problem. a parent element in the page is stealing the focus of my click
[14:11:00] <werle> [fields]: How are the tabs structured?
[14:11:13] <emu> and the function is a member of the doc. right ok so it's all close to the same.
[14:11:40] <emu> Thank :)
[14:11:42] <sirspazzolot> if this element is positioned inside of the content container in a table cell, it functions fine. if I move it outside the content container but still in the table cell, it no longer detects clicks
[14:11:42] <fikst> emu, no its not
[14:11:44] <emu> thanks*
[14:11:51] <[fields]> werle:  ?  based it from basic example at jquery site
[14:11:55] <sirspazzolot> does this sound like something that could happen?
[14:11:58] <emu> oh ...
[14:12:34] <BillCriswell> sirspazzolot: It depends on how the event is being applied to the element.
[14:12:58] <BillCriswell> sirspazzolot: If your selector is like.. $('table a').on('click', ... ); taking it out of the table would definitely break it.
[14:13:52] <sirspazzolot> it works with <td><div><p>CLICKABLE</p><p>content</p></td>
[14:14:17] <sirspazzolot> it does not work with <td><p>CLICKABLE</p><div><p>content</p></td>
[14:14:23] <sirspazzolot> cough BillCriswell
[14:14:57] <BillCriswell> If the selector is like $('table div a').on('click', ... ); then taking out out of the div would make it not work.
[14:15:05] <BillCriswell> It all depends how the event listener is being applied.
[14:15:23] <[fields]> werle:  default functionality at http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[14:16:14] <werle> hmm
[14:16:18] <fikst> emu, http://jsfiddle.net/PPq3z/2/
[14:17:02] <werle> how are you rendering the map?
[14:22:03] <sirspazzolot> BillCriswell: oh right. I fixed the listener. thank you!
[14:22:25] <sirspazzolot> (actually I thought to do that while I was in the bathroom before I saw your response heh)
[14:22:39] <BillCriswell> My best thinking happens there as well.
[14:22:45] <werle> cheers guys. have a good weekend
[14:22:50] <BillCriswell> You too
[14:22:50] <sirspazzolot> you too, werle
[14:24:45] <sirspazzolot> sigh. well clicks are being detected but the action I want can't find the target I want
[14:24:50] <raj> is $(document).on('click', '.somelement', function(){}) just as resource intesive as $(document).on('click', function(){})?
[14:25:16] <sirspazzolot> I swear I could do this if it weren't convoluted sharepoint-generated html
[14:25:51] <BillCriswell> raj: It's just checking to see if the target element matches the selector, it's not that bad since all the events bubble up.
[14:26:35] <raj> BillCriswell, the latter is the worst possible scenario, agreed?
[14:26:48] <raj> resource-wise
[14:26:58] <sirspazzolot> yesss. it works. it wasn't working ebcause the browser wasn't loading the new code B)
[14:27:21] <Zzaichik> so jquery 2.0 doesn't like IE8 huh?
[14:27:21] <alexr21> is there any way to add data to the event variable and pass that data using $('something').click()
[14:27:30] <NoiseEee> Zzaichik: thats right
[14:27:42] <alexr21> so that the listener for 'something' will have that data
[14:27:47] <Zzaichik> haha - awesome. that's all the excuse I need to stop supporting IE8.
[14:27:49] <NoiseEee> Zzaichik: been pretty clear about that ever since betas / 1.9.x was out
[14:27:54] <NoiseEee> Zzaichik: or use 1.9.x?
[14:28:11] <Zzaichik> I know man. I'm just messing around
[14:28:35] <BillCriswell> raj: I'd consider $(document).on('click', '.foo', function(){ }) and $(document).on('click', function(e){ if( $(e.target).is('.foo')){ }}) along the same lines.
[14:29:04] <raj> ah, I see
[14:29:07] <raj> with .closest()?
[14:30:17] <Bloomberg> Hey guys!!
[14:30:41] <BillCriswell> raj: Not sure I'm following you there.
[14:30:46] <Bloomberg> Anybody has worked with contextMenu JQuery Plugin?
[14:33:34] <DoctorMonocular_> hey I'm using the bootstrap datepicker, and it recently started acting goofy -- like when I click a date and the picker hides itserlf, another, faded out picker appears on the far left of the screen until I click something else. And when I click anything but an actively available day in the current month, another month appears right under the one I'm working in. Anyone seen this behavior?
[14:33:51] <sirspazzolot> if I want an event to be triggered if either of the following is clicked: a <p> with class whatever, or an <img> with alt whatever
[14:33:52] <DoctorMonocular_> I thought maybe I had hooked up multiple click events to the picker, but I ruled that out
[14:34:16] <sirspazzolot> is this done with "$("p[class='collapseText'] img[alt='collapseText']").click(function(event)"?
[14:34:22] <DoctorMonocular_> sirspazzolot 'p a[alt]'
[14:34:55] <DoctorMonocular_> 'p[class] a[alt]' if you want to force a class to be on the p
[14:34:56] <BillCriswell> $('p[class], img[alt]') if you really want OR.
[14:35:05] <BillCriswell> notice the ,
[14:35:07] <DoctorMonocular_> ho yeah, with a comma
[14:35:15] <DoctorMonocular_> sorry, that was brain fart
[14:35:25] <BillCriswell> I'll forgive you this time.
[14:35:38] <DoctorMonocular_> very courteous
[14:35:50] * BillCriswell is a gentleman
[14:36:42] <DoctorMonocular_> this datepicker thing is vexing
[14:37:21] <norjor> anyone have experience with requirejs and implementing domReady with jquery ?
[14:38:32] <sirspazzolot> oooh, there we go. thank you
[14:42:33] <BillCriswell> Night everyone.
[15:06:20] <Assimilater> looking at the git of ui, in jquery.ui.accordion.js on line 458 can someone explain what prevShow , oldPanel and newPanel are?
[15:06:41] <Assimilater> or 456-457 i guess more accurately
[15:12:43] <Assimilater> is there a difference between prevShow and data.oldPanel? they appear to be the same...
[15:18:33] <Bloomberg> Guys how can I scape this?
[15:18:34] <Bloomberg> "<input type='text' value='"value.base"'/>";
[15:18:44] <Bloomberg> The value.base is a aside var}
[15:19:02] <snover> runescape or farscape?
[15:19:32] <Bloomberg> No idea.
[15:20:05] <Qjimbo> Hi all, does anyone know how I can animate multiple divs in sequence, I do $( ".fade1" ).each(function( index ) { $(this).css('opacity',0).animate({opacity:1}, 1000); }); but it animates them all at the same time, I don't know how to make the each loop wait for the anim to finish
[15:20:52] <Bloomberg> What mens both?
[15:20:55] <Bloomberg> means*
[15:27:40] <Technodrome> Good day
[15:50:47] <JFranks> Is there any public/free tools for analysis of JS include overkill? I keep seeing situations where no CDN is used, jquery, jquery.min, jquery-ui, jquery-ui.sortable, etc.. etc..
[15:59:55] <JFranks> Seriously.. http://jsfiddle.net/xztbF/
[16:01:21] <eyda|mon> how do I add an element as a child to another?
[16:02:15] <JFranks> $('target').append('what_to_append'); ?
[16:02:43] <JFranks> 'child' .. oops
[16:03:15] <eyda|mon> oh, dunno why I didn't try that
[16:03:16] <eyda|mon> thanks
[16:03:20] <JFranks> Though technically.. if you append an 'element' to an 'element' it's going to become it's child. ;)
[16:21:48] <sunbeam> Hi, does anyone know how I can have datepicker work on newly added HTML input fields that have the datepicker class??
[16:22:16] <sunbeam> For now datepicker only works on <input> fields that were already there when the page was loaded
[16:27:21] <fikst> sunbeam, if you add a new field after the page load, you have to initialize the datepicker on it
[16:27:42] <sunbeam> how can i do this ?
[16:27:55] <fikst> the as you did it on page load
[16:28:33] <fikst> $('form').append('<input class="secondpicker">'); $('.secondpicker').datepicker()
[16:29:05] <b-lew> Can I grab some help on this?
[16:29:06] <b-lew> http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/96475/show-the-image-specified-in-src
[16:29:41] <sunbeam> fikst: ok

[16:48:50] <Shad0wByte> hi
[16:48:57] <jgaui> are there known issues doing custom builds?  I've run grunt custom:-ajax and I get errors
[16:49:10] <jgaui> I've checked out the 2.0.0 tag
[16:53:03] <Shad0wByte> Can someone tell me why word[i] isn't incrementing? jsfiddle.net/tdt5D/1/
[16:53:18] <Shad0wByte> It should echo all words typed in words.val();
[16:53:27] <Shad0wByte> It only displays the first word
[16:54:32] <p0rk> Is there a way I can trigger the samwe code from .blur and .click without copying it in 2 different places?
[16:54:59] <Shad0wByte> functions?
[16:55:08] <p0rk> yea
[16:55:11] <p0rk> any other way though?
[16:55:13] <p0rk> well
[16:55:15] <Shad0wByte> I'm not sure
[16:55:16] <p0rk> i guess i can do function
[16:55:21] <p0rk> its just a lot of them
[16:55:23] <p0rk> but i can do that
[16:56:54] <Shad0wByte> Can anyone debug my code plz
[16:56:56] <Shad0wByte> XD
[16:56:57] <Shad0wByte> jsfiddle.net/tdt5D/1/
[16:57:08] <Shad0wByte> It's just a few if statments
[16:58:00] <p0rk> ill look
[16:58:14] <Shad0wByte> Ok, thanks
[16:58:27] <p0rk> whats supposed to happen?
[16:58:40] <fikst> it doesn't run, syntax error
[16:58:46] <Shad0wByte> I don't see why words[i] isn't displaying every word in words.length
[16:58:55] <Shad0wByte> That's because it's just a scriptlet
[16:59:12] <Shad0wByte> It runs all together I can prob upload a full version of it
[16:59:12] <p0rk> what triggers it?
[16:59:30] <p0rk> but what triggers it
[16:59:30] <Shad0wByte> $("#form1").submit(function() {
[16:59:37] <p0rk> thats not in the jsfiddle
[16:59:51] <Shad0wByte> $("#form1").submit(function() { is what triggers the code
[16:59:51] <p0rk> your using an array
[16:59:54] <Shad0wByte> Yes
[16:59:54] <p0rk> dont you want an object?
[16:59:58] <Shad0wByte> one sec
[17:00:04] <Shad0wByte> an object?
[17:00:11] <p0rk> ...
[17:00:13] <Shad0wByte> It should work though shouldn't it
[17:00:25] <Shad0wByte> lol I know an object is sorry

[17:00:31] <fikst> not with a syntax error...
[17:00:43] <Shad0wByte> one second
[17:00:48] <p0rk> no
[17:00:57] <p0rk> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp
[17:01:00] <p0rk> thats not how split works
[17:02:41] <Shad0wByte> Oh, I was using regex
[17:02:50] <Shad0wByte> It was working
[17:04:22] <Shad0wByte> Yeah it works just the same

[18:54:37] <RobW> hi all.. can someone help me figure this out?
[18:54:52] <roswell> this what? )
[18:54:52] <RobW> http://tinyurl.com/c4cj6ec
[18:55:03] <RobW> resize your browser window and look at the right
[18:55:20] <RobW> once it's smaller than the original image size, then it works fine, but when you expand, it starts glitching out
[18:55:37] <RobW> i'll pastebin code
[18:55:44] <RobW> http://pastebin.com/wzKjZftp
[18:56:31] <Davey> I'm having an issue with a CORS Ajax request; my server doesn't like when the Content-Type is: application/json;charset=utf-8, it wants it without the charset=utf-8, I can't tell if it's jquery appending that, or Firefox
[18:56:48] <RobW> server
[18:56:50] <roswell> RobW, i guess this is more of css question
[18:56:56] <RobW> roswell: it's jquery ;/
[18:57:21] <roswell> yup, but i think i know what you're trying to achieve
[18:59:59] <RobW> ok well only does it on shrinking window lul
[19:00:31] <roswell> RobW, mind using table with height set to 100% with background-attachment set to cover
[19:03:55] <RobW> roswell: eh..
[19:03:57] <RobW> never!
[19:04:00] <RobW> :|
[19:04:05] <RobW> those are individual images
[19:04:45] <RobW> if it was one image it looks like crap how it ends up resizing
[19:04:49] <roswell> so? share 25% between four tr/td
[19:05:10] <RobW> ther are constraints, though
[19:05:23] <RobW> and i don't do tables for layout s;
[19:06:10] <roswell> RobW, imagine how would your divs look like without javascript enabled :P
[19:06:23] <roswell> so... tables may be helpful sometimes
[19:06:28] <RobW> people don't deserve to see websites w/js disabled
[19:06:43] <roswell> got your point )
[19:43:06] <raj> can I have two namespaces for an event?
[19:43:18] <raj> so I have two ways of disabling it
[19:45:48] <RobW> http://tinyurl.com/c7gdhb3 - maximize your browser (widest possible).. then shrink.. any way to smooth the sidebar out?
[20:06:05] <raz> anyone know a good ajax manager plugin (queue, fifo)?
[20:06:15] <raz> the ajaxmanager plugin seems to have disappeared from the internet :/
[20:26:19] <Z3R0> o.o Gentlecat is your name Roman ?

[20:48:49] <Mage> jes
[20:49:04] <Z3R0> yep ;)
[20:49:10] <Z3R0> jquery.com instantly loaded for me ;)
[20:49:51] <snowyrooftops_> Oh. Last night, jQuery.com wouldn't load for hours, then it did, now it won't again.
[20:50:28] <snowyrooftops_> I am able to access Google, StackOverflow, and pretty much everything else on the web except jQuery.com :-(
[20:51:10] <relipse> how do i check if jqueryui dialog is already open?
[21:47:19] <mmlac> Is there a way to do jQuery.animate({ scrollTop: 0}, 300) using either CSS3 or anything that uses hardware acceleration? Doing it this way causes massive flicker in iPad doing transform3d
