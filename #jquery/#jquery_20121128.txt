[00:09:02] <grass7boy> hello
[00:09:28] <grass7boy> if we using document.write() in somewhere of a page
[00:09:53] <grass7boy> the html code will write into the position document.write is
[00:10:03] <ravenzz> don't use it
[00:10:10] <grass7boy> then...
[00:10:35] <grass7boy> if i will not using document.write...
[00:11:29] <ravenzz> I don't understand..
[00:11:29] <grass7boy> is there any ways to get "the current html tag where the script code in"
[00:11:56] <ravenzz> can you give me an example?
[00:12:00] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net
[00:12:00] <grass7boy> wait
[00:14:34] <ItsJustMe> All this is within a function which is called after every change of the dropdown-select-box: http://jsfiddle.net/GatheringXP/bS3yM/
[00:14:39] <ItsJustMe> Why does it only work once?
[00:18:37] <grass7boy> http://jsfiddle.net/eVEss/
[00:19:27] <grass7boy> the question is ... how to get current_container when we execute some script tag
[00:23:21] <hemangpatel> I want to do something after mouse is on div for some time . So how can i attach time to mouseover ?
[00:34:51] <bigkevmcd> grass7boy: you can't really, scripts are executed by the JavaScript engine outside of the document, there is at least one horrible hack to try and find it, but it's not reliable
[00:35:51] <grass7boy> will...
[00:35:52] <ItsJustMe> reset at jsfiddle deletes all public fiddles of yours? -.-
[00:36:00] <grass7boy> ok... i know...
[00:36:11] <grass7boy> thank you :d
[00:36:14] <grass7boy> thank you :D
[00:45:57] <ItsJustMe> A bit updated for better understanding: http://jsfiddle.net/GatheringXP/bS3yM/2/
[00:46:42] <ItsJustMe> set sort_order to something between 1 and 7 right after defined and you will see that'll work one time :)
[00:46:47] <ItsJustMe> oh, forgot update function :D
[00:48:21] <ItsJustMe> http://jsfiddle.net/GatheringXP/bS3yM/3/
[00:48:24] <ItsJustMe> so - last one :D
[01:11:39] <ItsJustMe> again so many idlers ._.
[01:15:57] <eip56> Anyone know how to keep the scroll bar but take out the scroller itself.. Trying to replicate what facebook does with its lightbox. it keeps the scroll bar but the bar you used to scroll is gone
[01:31:42] <seutje> eip56: overflow:hidden; and script the scrolling on mousewheel event
[01:32:03] <eip56> Well i dont want it to scroll
[01:32:16] <eip56> check out a facebook picture and notice what the scroll bar does
[01:32:25] <eip56> it remains but the scroller itself is gone
[01:38:00] <Mento> hey guys, is there a way to make this header (the large visual of the building) animation with jQuery (or is there a plugin?) http://goo.gl/okmhh
[01:38:48] <seutje> eip56: not a very good place to get ur examples
[01:39:07] <eip56> why is that?
[01:40:37] <aqeel> sorry quite busy today..back now
[01:45:04] <seutje> eip56: use browser zoom and it should become apparent
[01:45:27] <milligan> I have an <a href which I've given an id. The following: $("#arrival").trigger("click"); or $("#arrival").click(); seems to do nothing. Have I misunderstood the methods completely?
[01:46:15] <Cork> milligan: are you trying to trigger the default link click?
[01:46:32] <Cork> as in load the target of the href?
[01:46:46] <milligan> Cork, pretty much, what I've done is add a keylistener that reacts on Left key on the keyboard. When pushing left key, I want to trigger a href on the page.
[01:46:57] <milligan> Cork, yes. Execute the link.
[01:47:08] <milligan> Maybe I should be doing a window.location instead.
[01:47:21] <Cork> milligan: you can't trigger default events on a tags
[01:47:47] <Cork> the browser actively prevents it for security reasons (popup blocking and a few other reasons)
[01:47:52] <Cork> you can fake it though
[01:48:11] <Cork> window.location = $('#arrival').attr('href');
[01:48:12] <milligan> The window.location worked fine :)
[01:48:14] <milligan> Yep
[01:48:19] <milligan> Exactly the code I put in,hehe
[01:48:22] <Cork> it won't be exactly the same as click
[01:48:26] <Cork> but it will change the page
[01:54:07] <mazzachre> Interesting problem. When using jqueryUI.position if the element to position against is not on the visible screen, the position fails!
[02:03:58] <mazzachre> That makes position rather useless... Any info on this?
[02:05:43] <Mento> is there a way to make this header (the large visual of the building) animation with jQuery (or is there a plugin?) http://goo.gl/okmhh
[02:12:16] <NodeX> anyone know a quick way to get a string representation of a jquery object .. i/e <img src="...." /> from $("img").eq(0);
[02:12:35] <NodeX> infact nvm, I can do it with somehting else
[02:12:40] <mazzachre> NodeX: .text() ?
[02:12:44] <anew_> ..
[02:12:48] <techouse> .text
[02:13:49] <GoSox> does anyone have any preference over using $.get vs $.post ?
[02:13:59] <NodeX> no, not what I want but thanks anyway
[02:14:21] <NodeX> also .text() gives the text inside my object
[02:14:24] <techouse> GoSox: umm, totally different things :P
[02:14:36] <techouse> GoSox: i prefer $.ajax anyway
[02:14:51] <GoSox> i wouldn't call them totally different. i'd call them slightly different things
[02:15:22] <techouse> GoSox: how so? i mean the method is totally different
[02:15:37] <techouse> you use post to send data one way
[02:15:53] <techouse> you use get for things like navigating and stuff
[02:16:01] <GoSox> well yeah, you're making an http request with a different method, otherwise you are making an http request, sending extra data, and getting the results
[02:16:21] <techouse> off, but totally different usage of the two
[02:16:33] <techouse> you wouldn't want to send your password in a get query :P
[02:16:54] <GoSox> true
[02:17:03] <techouse> or a base64_url string
[02:17:57] <techouse> i use get to simply tell my server script how to work
[02:18:09] <techouse> as in conditions and maybe some ids
[02:18:14] <techouse> but that's about it
[02:18:51] <NodeX> get has alot of default caching too
[02:20:09] <colegatron> gooooood morning all!!
[02:21:23] <techouse> and dunno for post but get is usually limited to what, 1024 chars by default?
[02:22:41] <computer2000> anyone can help me pls, i have a timed infinite slideshow and i dont want two same images to follow each other, how could i ensure this wont happen? im just using random numbers for image selection
[02:23:14] <computer2000> i as thinking about setting a cookie for the last selected image and comparing to it, or maybe using localstorage?
[02:23:40] <techouse> umm, how about adding that number to a js array
[02:23:55] <techouse> and then comparing arrays
[02:24:09] <techouse> or better using query's .inArray
[02:24:16] <colegatron> I have just made some little apps with phonegap/jquerymobile for the view layer. I would like to find a good framework to organize my code in a MVC way.
[02:24:42] <colegatron> There is a common recommendation for working with phonegap / jquerymobile?
[02:25:00] <computer2000> techouse: i forgot to mention that the site reloads each time, so saved variabes get lost
[02:25:16] <techouse> computer2000: try this logic: when the random number appears push it to a used numbers array and then on the next cycle simply compare the new number with the array. if the array contains the number make another random call
[02:25:19] <techouse> hmm
[02:25:29] <techouse> store it into a session then?
[02:25:36] <computer2000> techouse: yeah maybe
[02:26:01] <techouse> probably the only thing
[02:26:24] <techouse> so tell your ajax script to save that number to your session var and that's it
[02:26:50] <computer2000> techouse: ok ill check that out thx man
[02:27:09] <anew> anyone using hexchat ?
[02:27:40] <techouse> computer2000: using php?
[02:27:47] <computer2000> yea
[02:28:18] <techouse> piece of cake then :)
[02:28:28] <techouse> if you need help pm me :)
[02:28:30] <mazzachre> So anyone using jQueryUI position library? Or is it generally considered broken?
[02:29:08] <computer2000> techouse: ok thx
[02:32:10] <colegatron> anyone can recommend some good mvc javascript framework which plays well with jquerymobile and have not much boilerplate code?
[02:34:27] <reloadz> hi!
[02:34:57] <ambikuk> hah?
[02:35:02] <reloadz> $("input[name=ctg[] && value=2]") - what is wromg in this? :D
[02:35:18] <reloadz> wrong*
[02:35:19] <ambikuk> i don't know
[02:37:24] <techouse> reloadz: you need to put that in quotes :P
[02:37:50] <techouse> like so: : $('input[name="ctg[] && value=2"]')
[02:39:04] <GoSox> is there any potential speed difference between using post or get, either on the client side or the server side? (assuming everything else about the local and server scripts are the same)
[02:41:03] <reloadz> techouse: still not working
[02:41:04] <reloadz> http://jsfiddle.net/9CK6T/

[02:44:44] <obert> hi, $("#foo a") is supposed to cover :visited state already?
[02:46:44] <jrockjiggz> obert:  :visited is not a selector, but is css pseudo tag
[02:47:04] <Cork> emm
[02:47:17] <Cork> its a pseudo selector
[02:47:28] <obert> jrockjiggz: i know thats why i'm asking. usually in CSS i do a, a:visited if i want to give the same rules
[02:47:58] <obert> if i dont set :visited, that rule will not being applied
[02:48:54] <Cork> obert: only some of the pseudo selectors work in a select query
[02:49:02] <Cork> obert: :visited isn't one of them
[02:49:38] <obert> so $("#foo a") is correct and i dont need to do $("#foo a, #foo a:visited") ?
[02:49:40] <jrockjiggz> I found a visited() plugin: http://remysharp.com/2008/02/25/visited-plugin/
[02:49:54] <Cork> obert: you need to define them in a stylesheet
[02:49:55] <Trisox> Hey Cork
[02:49:59] <jqueryImplement> hi, can somone look into, http://nicedit.com/demos.php   - wonder why the combo box values are not staying for font family etc when selected
[02:50:13] <Cork> obert: and $() doesn't add rules, it makes a selecton
[02:50:28] <Cork> so if the value changes later it won't affect your selection
[02:50:50] <obert> Cork: it is a .click event
[02:50:53] <Cork> Trisox: ello
[02:51:04] <Trisox> hey sup?
[02:51:14] <Mento> a last try, is there a way to make this header (the large visual of the building) animation with jQuery (or is there a plugin?) http://goo.gl/okmhh
[02:51:19] <Cork> fiddeling with ie10 :/
[02:51:24] <jrockjiggz> obert: $('a').on('click', function(){ $(this).addClass('visited'); });
[02:51:53] <Cork> obert: browsers is quite secretive with the information for :visited
[02:52:12] <jrockjiggz> Mento: that is simple..
[02:52:20] <Cork> obert: you can more or less only set the info reliably in css and there is no way to sniff it
[02:52:30] <jrockjiggz> ?animate@Mento
[02:52:30] <Cork> (cause it would leak the users history if it did)
[02:52:31] <bot-t1> Mento, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[02:52:34] <obert> Cork: atm i got $(".foo a, #bar li a, #content a").click(function(event){
[02:52:36] <Trisox> ie10 :|
[02:52:53] <Cork> obert: waht prevents you from adding it to you're css file?
[02:52:55] <Cork> *what
[02:53:06] <Cork> its where it belongs anyway
[02:53:15] <obert> Cork: it is a fade thingy
[02:53:29] <Mento> jrockjiggz yes, animiate will do the trick, but not sure how to recreate the zoom effect - i was hoping there was some sort of plugin i could use
[02:53:30] <Trisox> hahaha, sniff it :-|
[02:53:37] <Cork> you could try css3 animations
[02:53:43] <Cork> other then that theres no way
[02:53:50] <jrockjiggz> Mento: no comment
[02:53:56] <obert> Cork: i was just tryin to understand if that is correct in order to have the fade effect working when the links are visited too
[02:54:07] <obert> using just a
[02:54:42] <Cork> obert: nope, you can't target :visited at all (not in the sense of what it means in a css file)
[02:54:55] <obert> mmh ok thanks
[02:55:17] <obert> btw Cork your syntax in the above example is weird to me
[02:55:28] <Cork> my syntax?
[02:55:42] <Cork> did i even give a code example >_>
[02:55:51] <obert> uh jrockjiggz one, sorry
[02:55:57] <Cork> lol :D
[02:56:14] <Trisox> In linguistics, syntax (from Ancient Greek σύνταξις "arrangement" from σύν syn, "together", and τάξις táxis, "an ordering") is "the study of the principles and processes by which sentences are constructed in particular languages"
[02:56:31] <obert> mhm ok ty
[02:56:40] <seutje> what the random?
[03:00:24] <reloadz> hi! again! plz can anyone check my selector? wat is wrong with it? http://jsfiddle.net/9CK6T/1/
[03:00:42] <seutje> reloadz: escape the inner []
[03:00:50] <seutje> actually, double-escape, I think
[03:00:56] <reloadz> ?
[03:01:40] <Cork> no
[03:01:48] <Cork> you can't do  &&  is an attribute selector
[03:02:29] <reloadz> http://jsfiddle.net/9CK6T/2/ UPDATE - changes on value
[03:02:37] <reloadz> Cork: then what can i dee?
[03:02:44] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/9CK6T/3/
[03:02:50] <reloadz> i need to select ctg[] that was value....
[03:03:08] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/9CK6T/4/
[03:03:16] <seutje> looksie escapedy
[03:03:29] <Cork> seutje: you don't need to excapt the [] if you wrap it in a string
[03:03:42] <Cork> *escape
[03:04:12] <seutje> oh, the problem is that funky && thing he's doing, isn't it?
[03:04:19] <Cork> yup
[03:04:35] <seutje> my bad
[03:04:49] <Cork> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/9CK6T/3/
[03:04:56] <seutje> if only he added 1 line of markup, I would have known right away
[03:05:04] <Cork> :)
[03:05:14] <seutje> oh well, can't demand it all
[03:05:30] <Cork> the selector was completely invalid so it was quite easy to tell what he wanted to do
[03:06:25] <reloadz> still! if bouth are selected - it ides the class, but it should not do that
[03:06:53] <reloadz> if biat are selected and one is deselectedt it doulw show still, because one is selected from bouth
[03:07:30] <reloadz> biat = bouth, doulw = should
[03:09:42] <AntonKor> hi guy/gals, quick question. where is it best to cache jquery selectors? in the doc ready or outside it?
[03:12:35] <Cork> reloadz: btw $('input[name="ctg[]"][value="2"]').not(':checked') doesn't return a boolean
[03:12:50] <Cork> reloadz: so are you sure that is what you want?
[03:12:55] <zteffen> Hi, anyone used or seen http://handsontable.com before? It's an excel like jq plugin, I have a few quick questions about it...
[03:13:12] <reloadz> i need to know if it is checked or not...
[03:13:31] <jrockjiggz> AntonKor: as deep as you can tolerate.  I keep function only vars inside the function, If I need it across, i move them out of the function.. but never ever outside of the scope of $().. but this is my framework, it depends on your needs, but the goal is to keep the namespace clean
[03:13:46] <Cork> reloadz: http://jsfiddle.net/9CK6T/5/
[03:14:08] <Cork> reloadz: if that doesn't work you need to provide a full working example
[03:14:17] <jrockjiggz> Anticom: tl;dr - inside doc ready..
[03:14:26] <AntonKor> thanks
[03:15:03] <reloadz> Cork: THX! wrorks great! :)
[03:15:14] <Cork> AntonKor: if you store it inside or outside doc ready doesn't really matter; what do matter though is that you should never store it in the global scope
[03:15:31] <Cork> so there should always be a scope outside
[03:16:41] <AntonKor> right right right
[03:31:45] <zteffen> Hi boys and girls, I need a push in the right direction. I want to make a simple, editable spreadsheet that does calculations and has pre-stored prices for pre-stored items. Something like this: http://whitelight.no/test/table/whitelight.htm only dynamic. I've been thinking about google spreadsheets, is there a way of implementing it I can read up on?
[03:35:11] <zteffen> I want my clients to fill out a simple order-form where the items in the second collumn should autocomplete or drag/drop or something like that. handsontable.com looks nice, but can it speak json or get prices based on item?
[03:35:14] <jrockjiggz> zteffen: theres lots of plugins http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/30-amazing-jquery-tables/ but for your case, you might want to write something yourself..
[03:35:41] <jrockjiggz> zteffen: sure, what good would it be if it didnt?
[03:36:21] <zteffen> @jrock: what I always end up doing is take pieces from different premade scripts as i'm just a very novice coder. A decent tutorial would be a of great help!
[03:36:59] <Guest21584> in that case, google is probably your best friend :P
[03:37:23] <jrockjiggz> ^^
[03:37:46] <zteffen> yeah. I was hoping maybe the 300 coders or so in here had been trough something similar and could guide me better than google.
[03:38:25] <Cork> maan ie, opera and webkit can't event agree about how to align inline and floats >_<''
[03:38:49] * Cork la sigh
[03:39:26] <jrockjiggz> zteffen: i'm not up to date with any tutorials, just read api.jquery.com and ask questions as you code along... there are many excellent resources, but you'd probably find something to suit your needs through google
[03:39:57] <jrockjiggz> Cork: but IE is fast
[03:40:02] <jrockjiggz> thats all that matters
[03:40:21] <Cork> jrockjiggz: actually its webkit thats in the wrong here...
[03:40:29] <jrockjiggz> O_O
[03:41:15] <Cork> <div>saving <span style="vertical-align: middle">&nbsp;</span></div> (and some more)
[03:41:27] <Cork> doesn't align to the middle of saving in webkit
[03:41:30] <Cork> *sigh*
[03:41:30] <jrockjiggz> vertical-align has never worked as documented
[03:41:36] <jrockjiggz> yea
[03:42:04] <Cork> well opera and ie is actually the ones doing what i would say is expected
[03:42:04] <grafi> arent there some display: table hacks?
[03:42:17] <Cork> grafi: it generates other problems though
[03:42:24] <grafi> it always does
[03:42:27] <Cork> like text selection and other nasty problems
[03:43:08] <jrockjiggz> vertical-align: middle; to both elements normally resolves
[03:45:34] <Cork> jrockjiggz: ya, if you wrap the text in an extra span and set vertical align on it and middle chrome does the right thing
[03:45:39] <Cork> but... the opera and ie fails T_T
[03:46:13] <Cork> ahh, the joy of browser bugs; who can live without them :)
[03:46:31] <jrockjiggz> keeps the employers happy ;)
[03:51:22] <alaing> Doesn't jQueryUI datepicker have events?
[03:52:24] <Cork> not that i know of
[03:52:33] <Cork> i think it triggers he default events though
[03:52:36] <Cork> like change
[03:55:28] <zteffen> I know this isn't a markedplace for freelancers, but let's say I want to hire someone to code that little spreadsheet for me.. is 200$ a decent pay?
[03:57:20] <AntonKor> post a job on elance.com and set the buget at 200$, im sure there will be plenty of overseas proposals
[03:58:05] <zteffen> thanks!
[03:58:07] <AntonKor> if you want you can even specify you're looking for a US coder
[03:58:35] <zteffen> I dont care where the coder is from, as long as he understands my need and has those skills ;)
[03:58:50] <anew> trust me, care where he's from
[03:59:05] <anew> i.e. hire from a first world country imo
[03:59:29] <anew> personally i have had bad experiences with indian/chinese programmers in the past.... nots ure about anyone else, but i wouldnt hire from 3rd world again
[04:00:31] <zteffen> you probably have a point, I want to be able to make changes to this later on, and would prefer a easy-to-read code with some //
[04:01:38] <AntonKor> imo u'll either attract overseas guys or college/ novice coders with that type of budget
[04:01:54] <AntonKor> but it dont hurt to try D
[04:02:54] <zteffen> yea, but then again I dont require a custom built engine here.. A google docs template with some preset functionality would do fine
[04:02:56] <zteffen> https://drive.google.com/previewtemplate?id=0Aio6DJRfavQxdHl5M1VlQU41OUktMWJ1Z2ZDTktvZ0E&mode=public
[04:07:41] <seutje> anew: pretty sure china isn't 3rd world
[04:08:19] <seutje> unless ur a maoist
[04:10:13] <alaing> Cork I see there is a OnSelect method. how would I call this after the datepicker has already been setup?
[04:10:33] <Cork> call or bind?
[04:10:53] <alaing> See this is what I'm looking at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5751584/in-jquery-ui-datepicker-on-the-onselect-event-is-there-anyway-to-get-the-prev
[04:13:57] <Cork> alaing: you can't really call functions defined like that
[04:13:59] <alaing> bugger I see my datepickers already have a OnSelect define. Is there a way that I can "duck punch" (Paul Irish) the  function so it will add some more code
[04:16:02] <alaing> Cork: Never mind...I sorted it out
[04:16:27] <alaing> I got the onselect to trigger the change event for the item that its setup for
[04:22:24] <anew> guys anyone know if there are local irc jq channels ?
[04:27:55] <alaingMBCS> anew: this is the place to hang out
[04:30:56] <alaingMBCS> anew whats up? need any help
[04:31:15] <anew> no, just curious if there are jquery channels for specific cities for hangouts or something

[04:35:57] <alaingMBCS> anew I know there are jquery groups in various cities but not IRC channels
[04:38:38] <anew> mmm ok thanks alaingmbcs
[04:43:17] <alaingMBCS> anew : http://meetups.jquery.com/
[04:44:46] <anew> oh sweet
[04:44:59] <tomoyuki28jp> Is there a event like dialogshow?
[04:45:07] <tomoyuki28jp> I'm talking about JQM.
[04:59:32] <aqeel> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6266559/jQuery.plugins/Demo.aautoscroll.htm
[04:59:41] <aqeel> any one ever used this
[04:59:56] <AL13N_work> i'm trying to use animate with height: 'toggle'; but i want it initially hidden, i tried setting height: 0; but then the toggle doesn't work
[05:00:17] <AL13N_work> what's the best way to use height with toggle, and still have it initally hidden?
[05:02:01] <aqeel> initially hidden use css display none
[05:02:28] <aqeel> the at togle cjnage display to block or inline-block s required
[05:03:10] <aqeel> then at toggle change display to block or inline-block as required*
[05:07:47] <AL13N_work> aqeel: thanks
[05:08:10] <AL13N_work> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/4dJ3n/
[05:13:26] <aqeel> you are welcome
[05:13:35] <aqeel> glad to be of some help
[05:14:38] <AL13N_work> i had tried too far and had classes appear on complete to add or remove display none etc...
[05:15:02] <AL13N_work> changing the display none to put in the nonclassed div worked :-S
[05:16:11] <yuka> hey guys, can somebody recommend me a good "sticky footer" jquery script? I been googling around but found only either old code or something thats buggy alot
[05:17:01] <aqeel> AL13N_work: http://jsfiddle.net/4dJ3n/2/
[05:18:03] <seutje> yuka: you mean like http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/ ?
[05:18:13] <aqeel> yuka: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9878575/jquery-sticky-footer
[05:18:31] <aqeel> yuka: http://www.hardcode.nl/archives_139/article_244-jquery-sticky-footer.htm
[05:18:42] <yuka> yes but i dont want pure css
[05:18:51] <AL13N_work> aqeel: :-)
[05:18:59] <Eviltwin> Why would you specifically not want pure CSS?
[05:19:03] <yuka> because my design is fluid and i am using a special framework so correcting all other
[05:19:05] <aqeel> yuka: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/jquery-sticky-footer/
[05:19:14] <yuka> would give me grey hair
[05:19:37] <AL13N_work> aqeel: one more small tiny issue... interrupting doesn't work well with toggle, open it up, then let it close and during closing click again to try to open after all... that fails
[05:19:45] <AL13N_work> aqeel: any idea how to fix this?
[05:19:46] <seutje> aqeel, AL13N_work: should guard against spam-clicks: http://jsfiddle.net/4dJ3n/3/
[05:20:03] <yuka> aqeel thanks but i said with updated code
[05:20:18] <aqeel> ok..
[05:20:19] <yuka> the example your giving me for example uses $(window).bind(
[05:20:21] <yuka> ...
[05:20:23] <yuka> thats .on now
[05:20:35] <aqeel> you can convert
[05:20:43] <yuka> ye but i tried the code and tis buggy
[05:20:43] <Eviltwin> Then find and replace .bind to .on
[05:20:50] <aqeel> http://www.andismith.com/blog/2011/11/on-and-off/
[05:20:54] <yuka> so means whole code is bad
[05:20:59] <yuka> not just that is just example
[05:21:09] <yuka> thanks however
[05:21:19] <yuka> i am still waiting for somebody that maybe done this himself
[05:21:22] <yuka> and could share some :)
[05:22:59] <AL13N_work> aqeel: seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/4dJ3n/4/  if you during closing you click again, it doesn't work, it keeps closing even slower
[05:23:55] <AL13N_work> i suppose this is the side-effect of using toggle
[05:25:03] <aqeel> might be, animate not yet completed so it only registers next click if animate finishes
[05:29:08] <AL13N_work> aqeel: yes, but i want to stop the animation and return back
[05:29:16] <AL13N_work> aqeel: is there a way i can do that?
[05:29:39] <aqeel> explain more..
[05:29:52] <aqeel> return back to where
[05:30:08] <aqeel> and animation stop after sliding down or sliding up
[05:30:12] <AL13N_work> aqeel: well, if it's open, and i accidentally close it, but want it back; i don't want to wait until it's completed
[05:30:44] <aqeel> then why use animate?
[05:30:52] <aqeel> simply use show() hide()
[05:31:22] <AL13N_work> well, if it runs slowly, i'd like it to return back slowly to full position
[05:31:41] <AL13N_work> if i open and click during, i get it nicely closed with animate
[05:31:53] <AL13N_work> it'd like the same thing but when it's open and closing
[05:32:26] <aqeel> instead of animate might wanna use slideup and slide down
[05:32:56] <AL13N_work> aqeel: ok, so it's not possible with animate and toggle
[05:32:58] <AL13N_work> ok, thanks
[05:33:13] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[05:33:18] <aqeel> use this
[05:33:27] <seutje> AL13N_work: add true, true to the stop
[05:34:05] <AL13N_work> seutje: i saw your example, but that just makes me unable to stop the animation
[05:34:10] <seutje> AL13N_work: that'll make it jump to the end
[05:34:18] <AL13N_work> aaaah
[05:34:20] <seutje> AL13N_work: you wanna halt it halfway?
[05:34:35] <seutje> just call stop without re-animating them
[05:34:37] <seutje> then*
[05:34:39] <AL13N_work> well, i want to halt halfway and then get back to full size
[05:34:52] <seutje> thing is, since ur using toggle, any "open" state will make it try to close it
[05:34:57] <AL13N_work> right
[05:35:03] <AL13N_work> seutje: that's what i figured
[05:35:09] <AL13N_work> i'd have to split the animate
[05:35:15] <seutje> so either do ur own toggling, or live with it jumping to the end
[05:35:17] <aqeel> no need
[05:35:22] <aqeel> use slidetoggle
[05:35:25] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[05:35:39] <aqeel> are you using jquery ui
[05:35:40] <seutje> won't that have the same result? 1% open === open
[05:35:59] <aqeel> but is more robust than animate
[05:36:40] <AL13N_work> well, i wanted to use animate, because i had planned on doing other things than just sliding
[05:39:01] <midori-rus> this channel support users?
[05:40:19] <midori-rus> http://paste.org.ru/?os6gbh 25 line. how to set attr? its not work for me
[05:41:28] <jrockjiggz> attr('color': '#fff');
[05:41:31] <jrockjiggz> but honestly
[05:41:34] <jrockjiggz> honestly...
[05:42:11] <jrockjiggz> lol
[05:42:15] <jrockjiggz> attr('color', '#fff');
[05:42:23] <jrockjiggz> but why would you set color to an element
[05:42:28] <jrockjiggz> that is like saying
[05:42:37] <jrockjiggz> <p color="#fff"> which is like. HTML 3.0
[05:42:40] <aqeel> really strange stuff going on there....things being done
[05:43:06] <jrockjiggz> very strange
[05:43:21] <midori-rus> jrockjiggz look 4 line
[05:43:25] <midori-rus> here attributes
[05:43:40] <jrockjiggz> yes, so you would .css(attrRed) to apply those
[05:43:47] <jrockjiggz> but what is stroke
[05:44:05] <aqeel> border
[05:44:20] <aqeel> fill, stroke for drawing
[05:44:27] <midori-rus> jrockjiggz this for svg
[05:44:53] <midori-rus> raphael js draw elements
[05:45:50] <jrockjiggz> then attr(attrRed)
[05:46:33] <midori-rus> jrockjiggz http://paste.org.ru/?qaybm5
[05:46:35] <midori-rus> look html
[05:47:31] <jrockjiggz> attr(attrRed) no attr('attrRed')
[05:48:35] <jrockjiggz> and perhaps quote stroke:  "stroke": "#74675C"
[05:50:42] <jrockjiggz> midori-rus: you see it works here http://jsfiddle.net/ZZSLC/
[05:54:51] <BadCodSmell> Is it normal for jquery to lose .data on an element?
[05:57:24] <BadCodSmell> can't I just data="{&lt;a$gt;:1}" ?
[05:58:18] <NodeX> data-foo="bar"
[05:58:33] <BadCodSmell> I swear json used to work
[05:58:34] <NodeX> then you may get it with element.data('foo');
[05:59:07] <BadCodSmell> how can I inline json in it?
[05:59:21] <BadCodSmell> without having to eval it
[05:59:29] <NodeX> never tried so I wouldn't know

[06:02:34] <clocKwize> hi guys, I'm writing a chrome extension and I want to inject jquery in to pages, but I don't want it to interfere with anything on that page already (might or might not have jQuery) Is there any way I can wrap jQuery so it only sits inside my own namespace or something?
[06:03:17] <aqeel> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6266559/jQuery.plugins/Default.htm
[06:03:26] <BadCodSmell> i see that
[06:03:27] <juha_> ?noconflict @ clocKwize
[06:03:28] <bot-t1> clocKwize, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[06:03:29] <BadCodSmell> let me try data-
[06:03:30] <aqeel> anyone know any better
[06:03:57] <BadCodSmell> i guess it just doesn't work with plain data
[06:04:12] <xec_> BadCodSmell: what is "plain data"
[06:04:18] <midori-rus> jrockjiggz this work for me area[i] = R.path($(this).attr("data-path")).attr(eval(attrName));
[06:04:26] <aqeel> or someone can guide me to make this 1.8 compatable
[06:04:47] <clocKwize> juha_, that isn't good enough, as my script will load after the page.. which means I could potentially overwrite the pages version of jquery and then remove it alltogether?
[06:05:59] <xec_> clocKwize: it should work
[06:06:40] <xec_> clocKwize: lets say the page already is using $ - then you include jQuery. now $ is jQuery - then you run noConflict and $ is set back to whatever it was before
[06:07:20] <clocKwize> hmmmm ok thanks
[06:08:07] <abletony84> At this text ad rotator which cycles the text when pressing "back" and "forth" - and it's got some JS to set its width so it doesn't clash into the sidebar: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/TPdpE/ - how do I stretch it to full width when it drops below the sidebar: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/TPdpE/1/ ?
[06:08:55] <NodeX> BadCodSmell : I used to do things like this completely fine... data-attributes="{"isAjax":true,"ajaxUrl":"/@/7caa6ea36e585c72171d0df552230a115367796f/","width":400,"height":255,"addOverlay":true,"heading":"<h5>Title</h5>","closeOnOverlayClick":true,"removeDialogue":false}"
[06:09:59] <BadCodSmell> im just surprided i can't simply do that on data
[06:10:31] <BadCodSmell> but html seems to have issues with it too so i dont think its just jquery
[06:10:46] <BadCodSmell> as in the attribute was gone
[06:11:11] <xec_> BadCodSmell: you can. but .data() will parse things for you. if you want non-html5 data-* attributes you just need to parse it yourself http://jsfiddle.net/2UF4n/1/
[06:11:36] <xec_> BadCodSmell: that is invalid HTML, mind you
[06:13:09] <NodeX> I had to change quoting to make it work
[06:13:14] <NodeX> sorry that's a typo
[06:13:21] <NodeX> data-attributes='{"isAjax":true,"ajaxUrl":"/@/7caa6ea36e585c72171d0df552230a115367796f/","width":400,"height":255,"addOverlay":true,"heading":"<h5>Title</h5>","closeOnOverlayClick":true,"removeDialogue":false}'
[06:13:31] <NodeX> single quotes round the attribute*
[06:21:00] <owiue> Anyone know why this link navs to google instead of yahoo? http://jsbin.com/efaful/1
[06:22:22] <lz> owiue, you need to cancel the default click event for the anchor
[06:23:10] <xec_> owiue: console.log() calls will stop execution in IE
[06:23:32] <xec_> owiue: so i'm guessing you're testing in IE? :D
[06:23:43] <xec_> without the console open?
[06:23:47] * xec_ takes a long shot
[06:25:45] <seutje> same thing on chomesies
[06:27:55] <aqeel> for me opening in yahoo
[06:29:18] <seutje> does return false even work on on-attrubute event handlers like that?
[06:29:53] <aqeel> <a onclick="dataBounce('http://yahoo.com');" href="http://google.com">Yahoo? :-/</a>
[06:30:33] <aqeel> your href is google.com
[06:31:14] <AL13N_work> which is faster: using aggregated icons on one single image, or having them as data uri?
[06:31:24] <seutje> AL13N_work: data uri
[06:31:31] <AL13N_work> that's what i figured
[06:31:34] <seutje> otherwise u have a reauest for the css and one for the sprite
[06:31:41] <seutje> otherwise u get 1 for the css and ur done
[06:31:47] <NodeX> onclick ?
[06:31:52] <seutje> but make sure u don't have duplicate declarations in there
[06:31:59] <AL13N_work> seutje: wdym?
[06:32:13] <AL13N_work> you mean twice the same data uri?
[06:32:16] <seutje> yeah
[06:32:22] <AL13N_work> heh
[06:32:25] <seutje> SASS' @extend can be useful
[06:32:40] <seutje> and COMPASS can help you turn em into data URIs
[06:32:58] <AL13N_work> well, i have no problem with makin data uri's
[06:33:00] <seutje> u could even do both, and have them all in a sprite that's defined with a data URI
[06:33:17] <seutje> but I guess that's sorta silly
[06:33:53] <AL13N_work> well, i would think that having 50 different icons on a page with 50 data uris would be better than 50 times the same data uri
[06:34:04] <AL13N_work> and css stuff to get the correct icon
[06:34:21] <AL13N_work> seutje: but, how can you make sure that you don't have duplicate data uri's?
[06:34:41] <AL13N_work> eg: i have a thrash icon i use about 25times/page
[06:34:52] <seutje> AL13N_work: make sure u have 1 declaration with a bunch of selectors
[06:35:11] <AL13N_work> but it's not always background-image
[06:35:29] <seutje> yeah, then I guess data URI might not be the best option
[06:35:41] <AL13N_work> or should i use content then?
[06:35:54] <seutje> but uhm, if it isn't the bg image, what is it?
[06:35:59] <AL13N_work> icon
[06:36:29] <AL13N_work> like a plus sign a minus sign a loading gif, etc...
[06:36:31] <AL13N_work> small stuff
[06:37:04] <AL13N_work> is there a way to have one "preloaded" data uri and having the other places get that image?
[06:37:58] <AL13N_work> seutje: i would think that if it's a small image, the data uri is also pretty small, and thus it would not be an issue to have multiple identicals
[06:38:29] <AL13N_work> seutje: or perhaps content would be doable
[06:38:48] <AL13N_work> img .thrash {}
[06:38:51] <seutje> I'm confused, what's an icon if it ain't a BG image on something?
[06:39:10] <AL13N_work> img .thrash {content: 'data:...;}
[06:39:25] <seutje> oh, why would you do that?
[06:39:32] <seutje> blind ppl will be all "the fuck?"
[06:39:34] <AL13N_work> seutje: i mean, i would normally use a <img src="" /> in the html
[06:40:06] <seutje> I still don't get why you wouldn't just use a bg image
[06:40:18] <seutje> and you're nesting elements within an image tag?
[06:40:18] <AL13N_work> seutje: how would i use background image in such a case?
[06:40:39] <AL13N_work> seutje: now you're confusing me...
[06:41:04] <AL13N_work> seutje: think like a table with a thrash icon at the end to be able to delete that row
[06:41:07] <AL13N_work> for instance
[06:41:25] <seutje> img .thrash {content: 'data:...;} <- is <img src="yadayada"><div class="trash"></div></img> ?
[06:41:43] <AL13N_work> is it?
[06:41:55] <AL13N_work> aaah
[06:41:59] <seutje> iono, only thing I could think of that would match that selector
[06:42:03] <jrockjiggz> no such thing as </img>.. i saw one once.. in the wild
[06:42:09] <AL13N_work> img .thrash {content: url('data:...);}
[06:42:23] <AL13N_work> img.thrash {content: url('data:...);}
[06:42:25] <AL13N_work> sorry
[06:42:28] <seutje> oooh
[06:42:43] <seutje> so just replace content with background-image, works exactly the same, no?
[06:42:45] <AL13N_work> big diff
[06:42:51] <seutje> xcept blind ppl will still hear the original content
[06:43:06] <seutje> even if u text-indent it or whatever
[06:43:09] <AL13N_work> seutje: i don't understand how you mean
[06:43:28] <seutje> img.thrash {background-image: url('data:...);}
[06:43:30] <AL13N_work> you would use img { background-image: ... } ?
[06:43:41] <AL13N_work> huh
[06:43:42] <seutje> oh this shit is already an image
[06:43:44] <seutje> forgot
[06:43:47] <AL13N_work> lol
[06:44:33] <AL13N_work> seutje: background-image doesn't help with the dimensions of the object, afaik
[06:44:44] <seutje> img.trash { width:0; height:0;} img.trash:after{content:"";display:inline-block; background-image: url(data:...); } ?
[06:45:06] <seutje> or something like that
[06:45:08] <AL13N_work> wow
[06:45:11] <AL13N_work> that's going far
[06:45:32] <seutje> I put *ALL* my sprites in generated content
[06:45:33] <jrockjiggz> seutje: jsfiddle would probably help you find a proper solution ;)
[06:45:37] <AL13N_work> seutje: wouldn't it be less complicate to just have <img src="data:..." alt="bla" /> ?
[06:46:02] <seutje> AL13N_work: well, ur trying to replace an image with another one, it's inherently awkward
[06:46:16] <AL13N_work> seutje: well, no, i'm not trying to replace it
[06:46:28] <AL13N_work> seutje: i think we're miscommunicating...
[06:46:40] <seutje> that's what fucking with the content will do, no?
[06:46:46] <jrockjiggz> seutje: what are you trying to achieve
[06:47:03] <logh> is it resonable to try and preload 400 images
[06:47:06] <AL13N_work> seutje: i was just thinking of solutions not to have double data uri's
[06:47:09] <seutje> I'm trying to figure out what AL13N_work is trying to achieve :D
[06:47:23] <jrockjiggz> i have no idea whats going on
[06:47:24] <AL13N_work> seutje: you told me not to have duplicate data uri's
[06:47:34] <seutje> AL13N_work: well if it's content here and BG image there, u'll need at least 2 statements for it
[06:47:42] <AL13N_work> ok, scratch everything, i want a table with the last column a trash icon
[06:47:55] <AL13N_work> i though the quickest way would be to have data uri
[06:48:19] <seutje> well just the icon is easy
[06:48:36] <seutje> td:last-child { background: ... }
[06:48:56] <seutje> but that's like 0 A11Y
[06:49:13] <AL13N_work> seutje: ok, but they need to be clickable and there needs to be 3 icons in the last column
[06:49:16] <AL13N_work> oh wait
[06:49:28] <AL13N_work> you'll just do 3 extra columns with one background image in it
[06:49:31] <AL13N_work> ic
[06:49:39] <AL13N_work> what about blind people?
[06:49:57] <seutje> yeah, what about them blindies
[06:50:11] <AL13N_work> seutje: they just see 3 empty columns
[06:50:31] <AL13N_work> this is why i put an a tag in the td
[06:50:51] <AL13N_work> but how do i do background image on an a tag, since a is inline...
[06:50:58] <AL13N_work> the dimension won't be good
[06:51:15] <seutje> what do u mean, since it's inline?
[06:51:18] <seutje> just set it to block?
[06:51:45] <AL13N_work> ok
[06:51:59] <AL13N_work> but still the blind people will only see an a tag with no text in it
[06:52:17] <AL13N_work> thus they don't know you have to use this a tag to delete the row
[06:52:28] <AL13N_work> i could set title, i don't think a has an alt tag
[06:52:30] <seutje> why no text?
[06:52:40] <Bleadof> Is there a way to trigger ajaxError handler through jQuery somehow without actually making a failing request? I don't want to make any requests in my unit tests...
[06:52:48] <AL13N_work> seutje: because the text will appear on top of the background image
[06:52:57] <seutje> text-indent?
[06:53:19] <AL13N_work> text indent and then what? overflow: hidden?
[06:53:19] <Bleadof> And mocking is a bit tricky since I'm using require.js to pass the jQuery object to my module.
[06:53:25] <aqeel> anyone care to go in depths and change the plugin to support jquery 1.8
[06:53:43] <aqeel> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6266559/jQuery.plugins/Test.aautoscroll.htm
[06:54:23] <AL13N_work> seutje: so, in short you always use background-image for images
[06:54:27] <garulf> Hi guys, How can i select the first td in very tr of a table?
[06:54:38] <AL13N_work> :first
[06:55:28] <aqeel> tr~td
[06:55:32] <garulf> AL13N_work: table td:first take only the first
[06:55:40] <garulf> of the first row
[06:55:56] <seutje> AL13N_work: I do, yeah
[06:56:01] <AL13N_work> ok
[06:56:05] <seutje> AL13N_work: but I also always use generated content for my spriting
[06:56:15] <seutje> so I can have 2 icons on my links, even in ie8!
[06:56:16] <nb-ben> hi, how would I fire an event every time DOM hierarchy changes under a specific node?
[06:56:23] <AL13N_work> generated content, you mean like php or something?
[06:56:37] <seutje> :after && :before
[06:56:44] <AL13N_work> ah
[06:56:52] <seutje> ?g css generated content w3c
[06:56:53] <b-ot> seutje, 12 Generated content, automatic numbering, and lists - W3C → http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html
[06:56:53] <bot-t1> seutje, 12 Generated content, automatic numbering, and lists - W3C - http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html
[06:57:24] <seutje> AL13N_work: for straight up icons, I usually go with text-indent and bg image: http://jsfiddle.net/9skBY/
[06:57:38] <AL13N_work> ic
[06:58:12] <aqeel> sorry
[06:58:17] <aqeel> tr+td
[06:58:32] <aqeel> + will choose every first in matched selected
[06:59:55] <garulf> AL13N_work, aqeel : tr td:first-child by the way
[07:00:47] <AL13N_work> seutje: thanks alot for the explanation and everything
[07:00:56] <coderDJ412> sixcorners: via ajax post request
[07:01:01] <seutje> AL13N_work: np, sorry for the confusion :P
[07:01:02] <aqeel> agreed
[07:01:12] <seutje> then again, it wasn't very jQuery ;)
[07:01:35] <AL13N_work> seutje: hmm, yes
[07:02:10] <nb-ben> hi, is there a way to listen for hierarchy changes or children changes for a specific node?
[07:02:26] <AL13N_work> nb-ben: .live()
[07:02:28] <seutje> ?mdn mutation events
[07:02:29] <bot-t1> seutje, Couldn't find "mdn mutation events" in jQuery Docs.
[07:02:35] <seutje> WAT?
[07:02:40] <seutje> ?g mutation events mdn
[07:02:41] <bot-t1> seutje, Mutation events - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Mutation_events
[07:02:41] <b-ot> seutje, Mutation events - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Mutation_events
[07:03:04] <AL13N_work> too much bots
[07:03:04] <nb-ben> AL13N_work, this does not do that. I mean to get an event fired whenever contents of a DOM node changes
[07:03:16] <seutje> nb-ben: see them MDN links
[07:03:20] <nb-ben> AL13N_work, not to have a click event live on dom changes, for instance
[07:03:28] <seutje> fuck, it's observers, my bad

[07:04:24] <nb-ben> oh well
[07:04:31] <nb-ben> I tend to support only FF/chrome users anyway
[07:04:37] <owiue> xec_: nope, I never even open IE.
[07:04:38] <AL13N_work> lol
[07:05:05] <AL13N_work> this reminds me of a client meeting i had on monday, at the end of the demo, one of them asks me "Is this gonna be supported in Firefox?"
[07:05:16] * AL13N_work facepalms, i had done the demo in FF...
[07:05:33] <owiue> xec_: found the issue, though... had to "return false;" in the onclick attr.
[07:05:35] <AL13N_work> if clueless client people are already asking for FF support... i mean wow
[07:05:51] <owiue> http://jsbin.com/efaful/3/edit is a fixed, working copy xec_
[07:05:59] <nb-ben> supporting IE is like supporting terrorism nowdays
[07:06:04] <AL13N_work> :-)
[07:06:23] <AL13N_work> hey, don't be insulting the afgan people
[07:06:25] <AL13N_work> :-)
[07:06:37] <nb-ben> you're the one calling them terrorists ;(
[07:06:49] <owiue> nb-ben: I agree except for in certain rare cases.
[07:07:01] <AL13N_work> i think it's more insulting to call terrorism supporters equal to IE supporters :-)
[07:07:19] <owiue> AL13N_work: yeah, your comment didn't really make sense except for in a really racist way.
[07:07:32] <owiue> AL13N_work: yeah, I heard what you meant, too.
[07:07:50] <nb-ben> bout the same effect for the web as finding a place for terrorists in this world
[07:07:58] <AL13N_work> racist? i was just referring to that US gov says that afgan people support terrorists, and US gov never lies
[07:08:06] <owiue> you might've differently said: "don't go insulting al qaeda, now"
[07:08:31] <owiue> oh,well then I missed the joke.
[07:08:33] <AL13N_work> owiue: well true, allthougth that he said terrorism suporters, and not terrorists themselves
[07:08:35] <amund_> could anyone help me get my renumber function to work properly, its suppose to rename the name attribute of tags to "tags[0].name" etc.. http://jsfiddle.net/muaZV/
[07:08:50] <owiue> gah, maybe I'm just too tired.
[07:08:55] <AL13N_work> owiue: don't worry, i'm not racist here, nor am i a US citizen
[07:08:59] <owiue> I'm gonna hit the sack, guys.
[07:09:03] <AL13N_work> night
[07:09:09] <owiue> AL13N_work: I'm shamefully a US citizen
[07:09:21] <owiue> no worries, be well, AL13N_work

[07:27:17] <amund_> i only added ; to the functions thats not working now :P
[07:27:47] <dogmatic69> I want to change the class if the item has been moved and placed, 'change' does it as soon as the item is moved but before being dropped.

[07:30:44] <NodeX> yes and no worky in IE8
[07:30:53] <NodeX> might need to be \r\n
[07:31:34] <aqeel> u can try

[07:33:54] <enmand> Is thre a way to build a previous version of jQuery using the download builder? We want to roll 1.9.1, but we can't change the version from 1.9.2
[07:33:54] <aqeel> does it?
[07:34:10] <aqeel> "IE applies HTML normalization to the data that is assigned to the innerHTML property. This causes incorrect display of whitespace in elements that ought to preserve formatting, such as <pre> and <textarea>."
[07:34:15] <NodeX> IE is stupid
[07:34:17] <Keir__> i have an obj which has a property which is another obj, looks kind of like obj = { prop1: 'hello', prop2: { nprop1: 'hi',nprop2:'hello'} }
[07:34:30] <amund_> veQue: seen anything? ;)
[07:35:07] <Keir__> if i try to overwrite prop2 with another object i.e. obj.prop2 = { nprop1: 'lo' , nprop2:'hi there' }; and console.log(obj)
[07:35:24] <Keir__> obj.prop2 does not get overwritten, can anyone help me as to why this is?
[07:36:22] <aqeel> NodeX: http://www.quirksmode.org/bugreports/archives/2004/11/innerhtml_and_t.html
[07:37:32] <NodeX> I dont care about innerHTML
[07:37:38] <Keir__> anyone?
[07:37:53] <NodeX> I am gathering all <br> nodes and changing them to \n and putting them in a textarea
[07:38:00] <NodeX> it has nothing to do with innerHTML
[07:38:18] <enderx86> How do I deploy a Jersey webapp using web.xml? I am following the instructions on the documentation and it's not working - I get 'service unavailable', and not even my static files are being served.
[07:38:32] <enderx86> Sorry, wrong channel.
[07:40:45] <amund_> got it working now thankyou
[07:41:29] <BillCriswell> NodeX: $('#some-text-area').val($('#foo').find('br').replaceWith("\n")) work?
[07:42:28] <NodeX> not in ie8/7
[07:42:35] <NodeX> every other browser is fine
[07:44:25] <NodeX> not sure why I expected anything different from Internet explorer lol
[07:45:27] <veQue> amund_ sorry got called awy
[07:45:37] <BillCriswell> NodeX: How about this: http://jsbin.com/atumuq/1/edit
[07:49:54] <NodeX> no worky in IE8/7
[07:50:43] <NodeX> if however you change <br> to <BR> in the regex then it's fine LOL
[07:50:50] <aqeel> victor: Thanks a lot for the workaround! Saved my day (night actually).  Code excerpt:  // Workaround for IE <PRE> innerHTML normalization quirk if (elem.tagName == "PRE" && "outerHTML" in elem) {     elem.outerHTML = "<PRE>" + str + "</PRE>"; } else {     elem.innerHTML = str; }  (Works with IE & FF)
[07:51:20] <BillCriswell> NodeX: Use /gi
[07:51:31] <BillCriswell> Instead of just /g
[07:51:54] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/GW9HX/1/
[07:51:57] <NodeX> I am not replacing like that
[07:52:08] <NodeX> it's not possible to do that in my situation
[07:52:43] <BillCriswell> Ok then.
[07:53:58] <NodeX> var brs=cloned.find('br, BR').replaceWith('\n');
[07:54:07] <NodeX> that's how it has to be unfortunately
[07:57:01] <BillCriswell> clonded.html().replace(/<br>/gi, '');
[07:57:11] <BillCriswell> clonded.html().replace(/<br>/gi, '\n');
[07:57:15] <BillCriswell> I meant..
[07:57:41] <NodeX> let's try that
[07:57:55] <NodeX> nope
[07:58:06] <BillCriswell> Is cloned a jQuery object?
[07:58:24] <NodeX> yeh
[07:58:46] <BillCriswell> Shit wait, cloned.html(function(html){ return html.replace(/<br>/gi, '\n'); });
[07:59:24] <NodeX> Object doesn't support property or method 'replace'
[07:59:44] <BillCriswell> function( idx, html )is what I meant.
[08:00:00] <NodeX> and I dont want to set the html
[08:00:19] <NodeX> scratch that I do
[08:00:49] <NodeX> Still no go lol
[08:01:10] <BillCriswell> Let's start over.
[08:01:11] <NodeX> it's the \n
[08:01:27] <NodeX> cloned.html(function(idx,html){ return html.replace(/<br>/gi, 'BLAH BLAH BLAH'); });
[08:01:37] <NodeX> that works and puts in the "BLAH BLAH BLAH"

[08:05:45] <aqeel> node does that work in ie8??
[08:05:52] <NodeX> no
[08:06:05] <derekpioneer> i'm making a simple infinite scroll. i have a var ajax which equals a "return $.post()"
[08:06:18] <derekpioneer> i'm checking that var ajax to see if it's true or false, that way there's not a million concurrent ajax sessions running
[08:06:20] <aqeel> are you using any emulator or original ie8 version
[08:06:30] <derekpioneer> seems like ajax is always = true though even when the request is finished
[08:06:31] <derekpioneer> http://jsfiddle.net/aHY7T/
[08:07:04] <derekpioneer> how do i get return $j.post() to return false when it's not making a request, but to return true when it is
[08:07:05] <NodeX> the one that comes with ie9
[08:07:11] <aqeel> duh
[08:07:31] <aqeel> all those do not prove to be solid ....better get original...spmode
[08:07:41] <aqeel> xpmode*
[08:08:05] <aqeel> ie 8 as 7 or 6, ie 7 as 6, ie 9 as 8, 7, 6, all buggy as hell
[08:08:29] <alcuadrado> anyone using jquery validation plugin? I don't know why it doesn't run my custom rule when I have an empty <option> in a select. But if I remove it works
[08:09:08] <aqeel> install xpmode virtual enviornment ie6, virtual enviornment ie7, virtual enviornment ie8...
[08:09:21] <aqeel> original copies will be at that
[08:10:50] <aqeel> i tried all that already, ie tester, microsoft web preview, everything, nothing comes as close and reliable as xpmode
[08:12:47] <shoky> derekpioneer: var ajax = $.post(...);  ajax.done(function(data) { ... });  ajax.fail(function() { ... });     you can't return false, ajax is asynchronous (you only know what happened when it calls your done/fail callback)
[08:13:30] <derekpioneer> shoky: how do i get that ajax function to stop firing a million times at once then?
[08:13:40] <derekpioneer> it will fire every time the person scrolls down a little bit
[08:13:42] <NodeX> see the thing is ... I can replace it with Other strings just not a line break, then also I can put a line break in at a different time
[08:13:53] <shoky> derekpioneer: then don't call $.post a million times at once
[08:13:54] <derekpioneer> i want to disable that scroll down event until the ajax has finished loading
[08:14:12] <shoky> it's up to you how many times to call it. figure it out
[08:14:20] <shoky> use boolean flags, whatever..
[08:14:23] <shoky> code that shit
[08:14:53] <shoky> you know when the ajax has finished loading because thats when your callbacks are called
[08:15:04] <derekpioneer> gotcha
[08:15:25] <john-dev> how can i only get the html inside a div when using load('…html #div');? now the div will be pushed inside the existing div
[08:15:53] <aqeel> use html()
[08:15:56] <john-dev> load('file.html #div).html() maybe :-/
[08:17:35] <john-dev> doesnt work :-/
[08:17:55] <john-dev> $('#header').load("index.php #header").html();
[08:18:39] <NodeX> Finaly done. I have to at first replace all <br> with :LINE_BREAK: then replace that string with \n ... how stupid is IE lol

[08:25:32] <abletony84> Hello. At this text ad rotator: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/XzkEA/ - how do I progressively resize #main depending on size of the window, and whether or not #main is next to or below #sidebar?

[08:26:15] <aqeel> $('#header').load("index.php #header");

[08:29:04] <abletony84> nFFFFF: Unfortunately the text ad rotator needs a fixed width to work and I was hoping I could use jQuery to progressively calculate it.
[08:30:24] <john-dev> nFFFFF, yes it does.. the request is working just fine.. but if i load .html #div1) into #div1, i get div1 inside div1 again..
[08:30:39] <aqeel>  $('#header').html(function(){ $('#header').load("index.php #header");});
[08:30:54] <john-dev> uh let me try this..
[08:31:15] <manuelbieh_> is it possible that jquery 1.7+ adds prefixes for css3 properties automatically? i think i have heard something like that
[08:31:26] <aqeel> .html() ..replaces your tag but load() appends to available tag
[08:31:31] <john-dev> <div id="header" style="top: 0px;">
[08:31:31] <john-dev> <div id="header">
[08:31:32] <john-dev> ..

[08:37:00] <aqeel> never use same ID more than once..
[08:37:05] <john-dev> i dont
[08:37:08] <john-dev> thats the result -.-
[08:37:42] <aqeel> than if html() that should have been replaced
[08:37:58] <john-dev> http://www.wepixel.de/p/qWkKKLbR
[08:38:02] <john-dev> thats before and after

[08:38:46] <nFFFFF> $('#header').replaceWith(function() { $(this).load("index.php #header"); });
[08:39:05] <john-dev> replace with, sounds good..
[08:39:25] <nFFFFF> Or load the new html into ghost element, and use replacewith
[08:39:51] <john-dev> the ghost elemt is what i tried not to do..
[08:40:00] <john-dev> replacewith wont work with my div animation.. gay..
[08:40:49] <john-dev> ill probably add sub-divs..
[08:44:19] <john-dev> 	$('#header').load("index.php #header_child");

[08:47:43] <aqeel> extreme something fishy  cooking here
[08:48:37] <aqeel> body.load('index.php body')...
[08:48:39] <nFFFFF> whats wrong with $('#header').html(function(){ return $('div').load('index.php #header').html(); });
[08:48:50] <nFFFFF> not sure if thatd even work but you get th idea
[08:49:00] <shoky> the load is asynchronous
[08:49:26] <shoky> the .html() will be empty, no?
[08:49:42] <shoky> also i think you meant $('<div>') ?
[08:50:04] <nFFFFF> yep
[08:51:08] <chaitime> does anyone know of any method to swipe divs around? I tried swipejs, but it requires the divs to have the same height to look properly, royal slider cost money and pageswipe you cant scroll down
[08:51:59] <[diecast]> id them and replace?
[08:52:05] <nFFFFF> var x = $('<div>').load('index.php #header').html(); $.when(x).done(function(){ $('#header').html(x.html()); }; ?
[08:53:21] <[diecast]> would it be poor form to id divs in order to manage them?
[08:53:22] <nFFFFF> -.html()
[09:03:36] <Gho5t> [diecast]: sure
[09:03:48] <[diecast]> whay?
[09:03:52] <Gho5t> or you can use some of the advanced pseudo selectors
[09:03:52] <[diecast]> *why
[09:03:58] <ow1n> Is it just me or is the datepicker localization example broken?
[09:04:00] <Gho5t> if your dom is stable enough
[09:04:27] <[diecast]> Gho5t: oh, you are saying that about my first comment to use ids.. ok.
[09:04:46] <goddard> can some one help me with this ? http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/12/
[09:04:57] <kyoorius2> could anyone help me with an ie9 memory leak problem? ....
[09:05:23] <kyoorius2> its not particular to jquery but i asked in javascript and so i thought id ask here next
[09:05:31] <[diecast]> the only problem i have with using pseudo selectors in general is the uncertainty that comes with them
[09:05:31] <Gho5t> goddard: that is gross
[09:05:51] <Gho5t> $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().parent()
[09:06:14] <[diecast]> yikes, that is really bad
[09:06:27] <Gho5t> do something like $(this).parents([selector])
[09:06:39] <Gho5t> or $(this).closest([selector])
[09:06:49] <BillCriswell> $(this) is getting a LOT of christmas presents.
[09:06:57] <Gho5t> lol
[09:07:03] <[diecast]> oh man =P
[09:07:25] <BillCriswell> I'll be here all day!
[09:07:31] <BillCriswell> Just kidding, going to lunch.
[09:07:38] <Gho5t> damn
[09:07:51] <goddard> Gho5t: can you give me an example?
[09:08:10] <Gho5t> read the docs
[09:08:15] <Gho5t> for parents() and closest()
[09:08:39] <nFFFFF> goddard i fix it for you
[09:08:40] <nFFFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/13/
[09:08:42] <goddard> Gho5t: of the way youur talking about it being able to work
[09:10:07] <goddard> nFFFFF: then it doesn't work in this instance http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/14/
[09:11:06] <chaitime> [diecast], were you replying to me?
[09:12:08] <ow1n> Is localization of the datepicker broken in the latest version? It is in the demo example.
[09:12:13] <Gho5t> goddard: you're selecting the first activityid]
[09:12:41] <[diecast]> chaitime: yes.
[09:12:50] <Gho5t> so it always alerts 123
[09:13:01] <goddard> Gho5t: what im trying to accomplish is select the first directly below the image
[09:13:09] <goddard> that is clicked
[09:13:13] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/14/
[09:13:15] <taurine> http://gimado.com/
[09:13:18] <goddard> this might make more sense
[09:13:43] <Gho5t> can you change the dom
[09:13:49] <Gho5t> the markup
[09:13:49] <nFFFFF> goddard http://jsfiddle.net/C3EBx/15/
[09:14:04] <Gho5t> there you go
[09:14:09] <Gho5t> i was too lazy
[09:14:48] <goddard> cool thanks fellas
[09:16:31] <chaitime> [diecast], replace the div with its extra whitespace from the previous tab with what
[09:18:59] <[diecast]> chaitime: i have no idea what you want to do with them. it just sounded to me like you wanted to switch some divs around, so i thought base it on id and have at it.
[09:19:29] <[diecast]> i probably misunderstood, i'm good at that.
[09:21:22] <dekiss> how can I change background color of all elements which have certain class?
[09:21:50] <NoiseEee> dekiss: ideally you assign your elements a different class that has the background color you want
[09:21:54] <Joeytje50> hey guys, I've got a question, how do those callback functions work?
[09:21:56] <NoiseEee> dekiss: writing css via JS is meh
[09:22:11] <dekiss> i can assign another class
[09:22:12] <dekiss> yeah
[09:22:19] <Joeytje50> I've got an url which has &callback=cbfn
[09:22:20] <dekiss> how to assign al lelements another class?
[09:22:27] <NoiseEee> dekiss: see .addClass() and .removeClass()
[09:22:34] <Joeytje50> what should I put in the success: part?
[09:23:00] <Gho5t> i hate english sometimes
[09:23:02] <Gho5t> "an url"
[09:23:06] <Gho5t> is proper
[09:23:09] <Gho5t> but sounds so wrong
[09:23:28] <chaitime> [diecast], oh np, yea it was more of a swipe gesture for mobile phones
[09:24:26] <dekiss> <script>   $("glaven").addClass("selected");   </script> this will add class selected in div with id glaven?
[09:24:42] <[diecast]> chaitime: gotcha,  read it as "swap" instead of "swipe"
[09:25:01] <dekiss> but look I have elements which are of the class red now all elements that have class red I need to change background color to blue
[09:25:08] <Haprog> dekiss: no. it should be #glaven with a #
[09:25:10] <dekiss> how can i do this please its emergency thanks in advan ce
[09:26:14] <Haprog> dekiss: something like $(".red").css("background-color", "blue")
[09:26:23] <dekiss> thanks a ton
[09:26:43] <jrockjiggz> or .css({ backgroundColor: 'blue' })
[09:26:52] <Joeytje50> guys, why is http://jsfiddle.net/UVeyV/ not working?
[09:27:09] <Joeytje50> in other words, what should I do with the callback function?
[09:28:17] <dekiss> how can I place ordered numbers (1,2,3,4,5..) in all elements with certain class?
[09:28:54] <Cronoh> $('.myclass).append(); ?
[09:29:03] <Cronoh> lol that syntax sorry its early
[09:29:23] <anew> joeytje50 where's the rest ?
[09:29:39] <Joeytje50> anew: the rest?
[09:30:19] <anew> i mean what are you trying to do here on success ?
[09:30:33] <Joeytje50> on success I like to get the console.log() to run to begin with
[09:30:40] <Joeytje50> that doesn't work even
[09:30:48] <NoiseEee> dekiss: $('.class').html('1,2,3,4,5...')
[09:30:53] <Gho5t> Joeytje50: I don't see a success parameter for .ajax()
[09:31:15] <Gho5t> done
[09:31:15] <ow1n> If it is the case that translations must be explicitly included, where are the official localization files? http://edvanbeinum.com/localisation-in-jquery-datepicker
[09:31:17] <NoiseEee> dekiss: also, a class named "red" is a terrible idea
[09:31:32] <Gho5t> nvm my search failed
[09:31:43] <dekiss> I have body>div>elements from one class how to go into each element with DOM and write there ordered numbers for each of them
[09:31:51] <Joeytje50> Gho5t: the o in $.ajax(o) has success: in it, right?
[09:32:06] <Gho5t> right was talking about something else
[09:32:07] <dekiss> write numbers int othem the elements are drwaed squares
[09:32:10] <Gho5t> but yeah it looks ok
[09:32:25] <Joeytje50> http://jsfiddle.net/UVeyV/1/ Gho5t: you'll see o in the console there
[09:32:43] <Joeytje50> so anyway
[09:32:52] <Gho5t> ajax doesn't accept an object
[09:32:52] <Joeytje50> I just need to know how to use these callback functions, that's all
[09:33:04] <Gho5t> it accepts a list
[09:33:14] <Gho5t> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:33:19] <Joeytje50> huh?
[09:33:28] <Gho5t> this is your line
[09:33:30] <Gho5t> return $.ajax(o);
[09:33:38] <Gho5t> Query.ajax( url [, settings] )
[09:33:45] <Gho5t> jQuery.ajax( url [, settings] )
[09:33:50] <Joeytje50> jQuery.ajax( settings )
[09:33:55] <Joeytje50> I'm using that
[09:33:59] <Joeytje50> the settings include the url
[09:34:25] <Gho5t> gotcha
[09:34:34] <Gho5t> didn't realize settings allowed a url
[09:35:33] <Joeytje50> just doing $.ajax({url:'http://blackle.com',success:function(a){console.log(a)}}); works
[09:35:40] <Joeytje50> except for Access-Control-Allow-Origin of course
[09:35:43] <Joeytje50> anyway
[09:35:55] <Joeytje50> still my question stands, could someone please explain to me how to use callback functions
[09:37:08] <muay-guy> hi, I have a $.getJason that brings some json objects and adds them to a dynamic <select>, but for some reason it's adding each element twice: http://jsfiddle.net/H6xM8/3/
[09:38:01] <Gho5t> you're using it fine
[09:38:02] <muay-guy> (sorry, I didn't know how to reproduce that effect in the fiddle, I share it mostly in case there's something obvious in the js side that I'm messing up)
[09:38:12] <Gho5t> Joeytje50: you're using it fine
[09:38:18] <Gho5t> why don't you explain what the issue is
[09:38:37] <Joeytje50> I'm obviously not using it fine
[09:38:45] <Joeytje50> because the callback function doesn't run
[09:38:46] <Joeytje50> http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20html%20where%20url%20%3D%20%22http%3A%2F%2Fblackle.com%2F%22%20and%20xpath%3D%22*%22&format=xml&callback=cbfn
[09:38:51] <Joeytje50> I'm getting that reply
[09:38:59] <Gho5t> i ran your code
[09:39:01] <Gho5t> looked in the console
[09:39:03] <Gho5t> saw the data
[09:39:19] <Joeytje50> on http://jsfiddle.net/UVeyV/
[09:39:26] <Gho5t> yep
[09:39:41] <Joeytje50> what browser?
[09:39:45] <Gho5t> firefox
[09:39:52] <Joeytje50> my chrome 23 doesn't work
[09:41:35] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/VnuUh/ @ Joeytje50
[09:42:14] <Gho5t> Joeytje50: you're right, won't run in chrome for me either
[09:42:19] <Gho5t> must be some security setting
[09:43:10] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript @ Joeytje50
[09:43:14] <NoiseEee> cc Gho5t
[09:43:29] <Joeytje50> yeah I know about the same origin policy
[09:43:38] <Joeytje50> which is why I'm evading it with yahoo
[09:43:54] <Gho5t> NoiseEee: yep but it works in FF. And why am I not seeing any errors in my console
[09:47:14] <zeejy> Hey, I'm trying to configure jQuery so that all ajax requests are made with dataType: "jsonp", and I'm trying to do that in ajaxSetup, but it doesn't seem to work. Here's what my ajaxSetup looks like: http://pastebin.com/RKh44WhZ
[09:47:40] <zeejy> Am I missing something, or can I not set it here?
[09:48:48] <NoiseEee> zeejy: sure, but where is that function getting encryptedString from?
[09:49:02] <NoiseEee> and drop the comma on the end of it
[09:49:46] <zeejy> NoseEee: In the parent function of where ajaxSetup is being configured. That's all working correctly. But when I examine the any AJAX requests being made, I don't see the "callback=?" going on..
[09:50:42] <zeejy> For context, here's the whole function: http://pastebin.com/ApJSUV8x
[09:51:29] <NoiseEee> never used it, but shouldn't $.ajaxSetup be set outside of any function?
[09:51:39] <Joeytje50> hey guys, I've got a string which is a valid HTML page, and I want to get JQuery to find $('#cse-search-box') in that string
[09:51:49] <Joeytje50> so, treating the string like HTML
[09:51:52] <NoiseEee> zeejy: also, drop the comma after encryptedString
[09:52:37] <zeejy> NoiseEee: Yeah, IE won't like that, you're right. $.ajaxSetup can be called inside of any function really, as long as that function is called before you want to make any ajax requests. It's modifying the same global vars
[09:53:53] <zeejy> Joeytje50: That could be tricky with just jQuery… I'm guessing jQuery works by traversing the DOM structure of the page (i.e. a tree), but you're string won't have that
[09:54:08] <Joeytje50> hm
[09:54:22] <Joeytje50> and it would be really laggy to convert it to HTML all first before checking, right?
[09:54:23] <NoiseEee> Joeytje50: google "use jquery to search html string"
[09:54:30] <NoiseEee> thats a question for google
[09:55:10] <zeejy> Joeytje50: Could you just use a regular expression? What are you actually trying to find $('#cse-search-box') for?
[09:55:25] <Joeytje50> zeejy: it's an example
[09:55:43] <Joeytje50> I'm using this for a much bigger page to find a table off which I get data
[09:55:59] <zeejy> Sure, but what is the problem you're trying to solve?
[09:56:06] <str8uplinux> if you go to google.com and right click the search input and select "inspect element" you will see that the input id = "qbqfq" So why can't i run $('#qbqfq').val('test123'); without getting the error "you can't call method val of null"?
[09:56:23] <zeejy> Even if you could locate it, you won't be able to treat it like a standard element in the way you typically would..
[09:57:04] <NoiseEee> str8uplinux: because jquery isn't a library included on the google.com page
[09:57:13] <Joeytje50> zeejy: yeah but then I could convert that small part of HTML to DOM elements
[09:57:26] <str8uplinux> NoiseEee: is there any way to accomplish this then?
[09:57:28] <BillCriswell> str8uplinux: They may use $ for something else.
[09:57:36] <NoiseEee> str8uplinux: use document.getElementById ?
[09:58:18] <Joeytje50> I assume $(htmlcont) for a whole HTML page will make it lag a lot, right?
[09:59:14] <NoiseEee> tias @ Joeytje50
[09:59:15] <str8uplinux> NoiseEee: i get the same null error when using this: document.getElementById('qbqfq').value='test123';
[09:59:25] <Joeytje50> tias?
[09:59:37] <zeejy> Joeytje50: Have you tried that? I wouldn't even think that would work...
[09:59:38] <BillCriswell> str8uplinux: gbqfba
[09:59:40] <NoiseEee> str8uplinux: first letter is a g
[10:00:00] <str8uplinux> ahh, thanks guys!
[10:00:26] <BillCriswell> Wonder what that means... Google Button Quick Find Button Advanced!
[10:00:36] <siovene> Hi. I'm posting some data usin $.post, and my data is {'images': [1, 2]}, but when it gets to my server, it POST data contains {'images[]': [1, 2]}. Where do those [] come from and how can I avoid them?
[10:02:56] <derbie> hello
[10:03:03] <derbie> where can i find jquery-1.6.3.min.js ?
[10:03:25] <derbie> because i have a plugin in an app that points to http://www.juquery.com/jquery-1.6.3.min.js and i think the site is malicious
[10:04:03] <derbie> i guess this is it http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.3.js
[10:04:22] <zeejy> derbie: <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
[10:04:27] <zeejy> replace 1.8.3 with the version you want
[10:04:46] <derbie> Thank you zeejy
[10:04:54] <derbie> That last link i gave messed up the page :D
[10:05:45] <derbie> Nope
[10:05:47] <derbie> http://vexper.usn.ro/?page_id=4
[10:05:52] <derbie> Something is terribly wrong
[10:05:55] <derbie> What could cause this?
[10:06:24] <zeejy> derbie: I chuckled at "something is terribly wrong". Let me see if I can figure out what's going on..
[10:06:29] <NoiseEee> a . after the number 3 @ derbie
[10:06:30] <derbie> zeejy: wait
[10:06:35] <derbie> I did it intentionally
[10:06:49] <derbie> Check now
[10:07:23] <NoiseEee> how are you 'including' that file?
[10:07:30] <zeejy> derbie: I just see jQuery code spilled out as plain text… You're not linking to it
[10:07:56] <NoiseEee> also you've already included jquery on line 29
[10:08:00] <Saaether> it looks like you just pasted the whole jquery source onto your page o.O
[10:08:20] <derbie> Hmm
[10:08:42] <NoiseEee> are you including it with php or something on the backend?
[10:08:43] <derbie> Let me paste bin the snippet that imports jquerry maybe i replaced it wrong
[10:08:49] <derbie> One moment please NoiseEee
[10:08:55] <NoiseEee> like i said derbie, jquery has already been loaded on line 29
[10:08:59] <NoiseEee> you have no need to do it again
[10:11:28] <derbie> line 2784 was modified
[10:11:29] <derbie> http://pastebin.com/6Zu5pcDC
[10:11:51] <derbie> If i didn't do anything wrong, then it means the script is broken somewhere
[10:12:08] <NoiseEee> take it up with whoever wrote that php script
[10:12:17] <NoiseEee> like i said derbie, jquery has already been loaded on line 29, you have *no need to do it again*
[10:12:38] <derbie> *deleting plugin*
[10:12:54] <derbie> thanks for the effort though
[10:15:29] <zeejy> derbie: that snippet makes a great case for MVC… :)
[10:15:49] <derbie> i don't understand the meaning of "great case"
[10:16:06] <NoiseEee> the code is a mash of php code and output
[10:16:11] <NoiseEee> and apparantly some js
[10:16:21] <NoiseEee> spaghetti code / the reason PHP has a bad rep
[10:16:33] <derbie> To be honest it is from a nulled payed script downloaded from a torrent. I was expecting it to be broken, but i wanted to be naive and give the script a try before buying it
[10:18:09] <abletony84> Guys mind if I ask:-
[10:18:25] <derbie> naive in sense of affirming that the script is not broken :)
[10:19:08] <abletony84> How do I progressively resize my ad rotator at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/XzkEA/ (which needs a fixed width to work) - depending on the user's screen, and whether or not the ad rotator is next to or below the sidebar?
[10:22:39] <TiffanyAmber> hi
[10:22:53] <TiffanyAmber> so guys, I've got a question
[10:23:00] <TiffanyAmber> I'm designing a DB
[10:27:41] <derbie> And of course i was directed to buy a script by a guy who didn't say that the feature is already built in wordpress and very easy to use
[10:27:42] <derbie> ...
[10:29:09] <MistuhKurtz> Any recommendations for a plugin/library for touch event handling?
[10:34:57] <juria_roberts> how do i send form data via ajax in jquery?
[10:36:03] <MalMen> what can i do to prevent a user to send & on a $.GET ?
[10:37:21] <Metrol> That's a lot of ping timeouts
[10:37:56] <Metrol> Didn't think you got a lot of that on freenode
[10:38:43] <Metrol> Anyhow, I was hoping to get some help with selecting descendant objects... been smacking my head on the desk on this
[10:39:11] <MalMen> $.getJSON("php/ajax/tickets.php?action=listagem&page="+pagina+"&order="+ordenartmp+"&estado="+estadotickets+"&tipo="+tipotickets+"&elemento="+elementotickets+"&prioridade="+prioridadestickets+"&assunto="+assuntotickets,function(data) { <- hwo can i prevent user of using for example assunto = 'foo&this=this'
[10:39:32] <Metrol> Starting with a DOM object (a table row) I want to get a specific select box named stateID[]
[10:40:07] <Metrol> I keep getting a selection of all the select boxes named stateID[] instead of just the one
[10:41:14] <Metrol> $(locRow).find("select[name='stateID[]']").parent("td");
[10:42:08] <Metrol> Instead of just giving me the one TD area, I'm getting all of them that have that select box in there
[10:47:59] <BillCriswell> Does more than one td have a select named like that?
[10:48:35] <Metrol> BillCriswell, yes
[10:48:45] <BillCriswell> You only want to return one though?
[10:48:49] <Metrol> correct
[10:48:59] <shoky> .first() ?
[10:49:00] <Metrol> Trying to update the states once a country has been changed
[10:49:25] <BillCriswell> $(locRow).('td select[name="stateID[]
[10:49:29] <Metrol> Haven't tried first(), I have tried children(), find(), and next()
[10:49:34] <BillCriswell> "]).eq(0)
[10:49:37] <BillCriswell> Or maybe one....
[10:49:43] <shoky> find() will find all of them
[10:49:53] <Metrol> shoky, and it does too! :)
[10:49:54] <shoky> and then .parent('td') will take all of them's parents
[10:50:28] <BillCriswell> $(locRow).find('td select[name="stateID[]"]').eq(0) is what I meant.
[10:50:36] <BillCriswell> I swear my brain is misfiring today.
[10:50:50] <Metrol> BillCriswell, doesn't ('td select') look backwords?
[10:51:03] <Metrol> backwards I meant
[10:51:16] <Metrol> Heck, I'll try it... hang on
[10:51:19] <shoky> it's just more specific..
[10:51:24] <shoky> a select under a td
[10:51:54] <BillCriswell> I might not help the rest of the day cause I feel like a crazy person right now.
[10:52:04] <BillCriswell> For everyone elses sake lol.
[10:52:09] <shoky> starting to sound like one too
[10:52:24] <Metrol> BillCriswell, Deep breaths... eggnog and rum... it's all good
[10:52:56] <Metrol> Well, now it always picks the first one
[10:53:01] <BillCriswell> I just left and had a beer about an hour ago for lunch cause if I stuck around my mouth was going to get me in trouble lol.
[10:53:03] <shoky> which one do you want?
[10:53:14] <Metrol> I need the td area in the row I selected a country in
[10:53:17] <warden23> G'day, I'm trying to get the link text to change from Yahoo to Google.. I've so far manage to have the link replace the URL: http://jsfiddle.net/KdHkE/ Any ideas? :D
[10:53:32] <shoky> isn't locRow that row?
[10:53:38] <Metrol> shoky, that's correct
[10:53:49] <MistuhKurtz> BillCriswell, stressed out at work? me too. crazy deadlines and none of it my fault. fuuu
[10:53:54] <shoky> then $(locRow).find  will only find elements in that row..
[10:53:55] <Metrol> that's where the country drop down triggered the event
[10:54:05] <Metrol> shoky, that's what I thought!
[10:54:07] <Metrol> Argh
[10:54:23] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[10:54:28] <BillCriswell> MistuhKurtz: Yeah, a lot of that. A lot of promises that should have never been made by people who don't understand the complexities.
[10:54:54] <MistuhKurtz> I think I would have gone crazy if I didn't have the 4-day weekend
[10:55:00] <Metrol> And none of this stuff is ever as simple as it would appear
[10:55:21] <MistuhKurtz> right. I tell my boss that it's like an iceberg, all they see is maybe 10%
[10:55:43] <warden23> I mean I can't use .attr for a word.. what else could I use instead?
[10:56:12] <BillCriswell> MistuhKurtz: absolutely.
[10:56:17] <Metrol> Okay, so I think the selector is still backwards... I need the full TD in the row that contains the stateID[] select box
[10:56:37] <MistuhKurtz> BillCriswell, hopefully you'll be able to deliver and make your bosses very happy though
[10:56:45] <shoky> "the" stateID[] ?
[10:56:47] <Metrol> I'm just able to work out the syntax
[10:56:53] <shoky> you said there's many
[10:57:02] <warden23> I tried .replaceWith() it does change the word.. but it kills the link.. so that's a no go lol
[10:57:04] <Metrol> Yes, as new lines come into the form
[10:57:08] <BillCriswell> $(locRow).find('select[name="stateID[]"]').eq(0).closest('td')  maybe?
[10:57:13] <Otineb> hey everyone. I'm trying to get a script to run on an input field when a page loads. Currently the script uses "keyup" which works when the user starts typing, but I'd like it to run when the page first loads in case data gets repopulated into the field. Someone mentioned "onchange" might work but I wanted to run it past the experts first!
[10:57:20] <Metrol> Bill, I'll try it
[10:57:39] <BillCriswell> MistuhKurtz: That just puts them in a position to do it more and more though.
[10:58:15] <BillCriswell> Me hacking up a quick example of something working isn't the same as implementing it into a complex site.
[10:58:50] <Metrol> It just keeps grabbing the wrong TD cell... it's not restricting itself of the row the country select was called from
[10:59:16] <warden23> Anyone? 2:58am and my eyes are failing me lol
[10:59:18] <BillCriswell> Metrol: If you had a pastie of the html it would probably be a lot easier to figure out. It could also maybe be misformed HTML.
[10:59:28] <shoky> ?text @ warden23
[10:59:29] <bot-t1> warden23, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[11:00:37] <Metrol> I think I may have another way to tackle this... gimme a bit
[11:01:14] <warden23> thx shoky
[11:01:16] <BillCriswell> jsfiddle is being slow
[11:01:27] <BillCriswell> $('.google-link').attr('href', 'http://www.google.com').text('Google');
[11:02:10] <MistuhKurtz> BillCriswell, well I can say in my case that over time they've grown to learn and appreciate the complexity of things, and to trust me and do their best to accomodate me. Especially once we hired another developer who has turned out to be a little subpar (we're gonna shift him into project management). I got a massive raise last month, and a bonus last week :3 it sure does get stressful at times though! hang in there
[11:02:27] <Metrol> var stateCell = $(locRow).find(".stateCel");
[11:02:37] <shoky> ?demo @ Metrol
[11:02:38] <bot-t1> Metrol, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:02:41] <Metrol> I just put a class in there
[11:02:47] <BillCriswell> MistuhKurtz: Wish I could stay the same.
[11:02:52] <Metrol> It's all off line... sorry, wish I could
[11:03:01] <shoky> you can make a minimal testcase showing the issue
[11:03:04] <warden23> awesome thanks BillCriswell :)
[11:03:07] <MistuhKurtz> well it's taken a long time to get there, lol
[11:03:14] <Metrol> Even the test site is behind securities
[11:03:19] <shoky> who cares
[11:03:27] <BillCriswell> MistuhKurtz: I actually gave up a great position because I'm too ethical to leave abruptly.
[11:03:34] <shoky> you're just asking about some DOM selection
[11:03:37] <BillCriswell> I'm regretting it a lot
[11:03:42] <Danwe_WMDE> Does anyone know how to do this properly: $( '<xxx><tr></tr></xxx>' ) ? jquery removes the tr elements because it treads the thing as HTML and knows tr is invalid in anything than <table>. So how can I tell jquery to tread this as XML rather than html?
[11:04:03] <Metrol> Okay, just in "theory", when I do $(locRow).find(".stateCel") I should only get objects within the locRow DOM area
[11:04:08] <shoky> ?parsexml @ Danwe_WMDE
[11:04:09] <bot-t1> Danwe_WMDE, jQuery.parseXML(data): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[11:04:09] <Metrol> Is that correct?
[11:04:20] <Metrol> I'm thinking the locRow has issues
[11:04:21] <BillCriswell> Metrol: Yes.
[11:04:38] <Metrol> Okay, I'll look a bit closer at that part
[11:04:39] <MistuhKurtz> aw bummer
[11:04:41] <BillCriswell> $('tr:eq(3)').find('.stateCell') would only grab from the 3rd <tr>.
[11:04:59] <shoky> $(this).closest('td')  maybe..?
[11:06:34] <Danwe_WMDE> shoky: thanks, I'll try that
[11:06:40] <chasep_notworkin> is there a way to find out the status on when (if ever) the menubar widget is expected to be part of the standard jquery-ui?
[11:07:28] <BillCriswell> MistuhKurtz: I've been at my current job almost 6 years. Salary didn't start off high and my hourly wage has only gone up $6.
[11:07:45] <Metrol> BillCriswell, shoky: Thank you both.  The real problem was I was too far up the dom with that locRow object.  Once I know the syntax wasn't that far off it became a bit more apparent
[11:07:58] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:08:18] <BillCriswell> Metrol: No problem.
[11:08:47] <Metrol> Well, NOW it isn't! :)
[11:10:35] <BillCriswell> "Just style up the page to show that information." What the fuck does that even mean.
[11:10:42] <BillCriswell> I'm so cranky today.
[11:11:05] <BillCriswell> I also want some hamburger helper all of a sudden.
[11:11:30] <Ogredude> BillCriswell: we ran out of hamburger last time we made that, we used ground lamb instead. Worked out really well
[11:11:45] <BillCriswell> Mmmmmm that sounds good.
[11:12:01] <Ogredude> ok once again, radio buttons are proving that they can turn themselves to spaghetti and mush in my brain
[11:12:28] <BillCriswell> Ogredude: What's the issue?
[11:12:57] <Ogredude> I've got a couple radio inputs that share the same name. Each has its own id. I'm looking for the jQuery selector and method that'll let me pull out which one's checked and give me a null or false or empty when neither of them is checked
[11:13:27] <Ogredude> I've got $("input[name='offer[kind]']") which returns me an array with the two inputs in it
[11:13:50] <shoky> ?checked
[11:13:50] <b-ot> shoky, part of the DOM element, $(this) is a jquery object you may want this.checked
[11:13:50] <bot-t1> :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[11:15:07] <Ogredude> ok so I'd just if $("input[name='offer[kind]']")[0].checked { blah blah } elsif $("input[name='offer[kind]']")[1].checked { blah blah } else { ugh. }
[11:15:16] <shoky> no
[11:15:32] <shoky> you'd look at that link and read how to use :checked
[11:15:35] <Ogredude> obviously I'd be doing all this in javascript rather than ogrescript
[11:17:39] <shoky> and to see if anything was selected you can check the .length
[11:22:25] <BillCriswell> Ogredude: $("input[name='offer[kind]']:checked").val() would be undefined if nothing was checked of the value of it if something was.
[11:22:43] <BillCriswell> Almost a sentence, Bill. Nice.
[11:24:03] <BillCriswell> Is it possible to just become dyslexic one day?
[11:24:58] <veQue> Bill you're doing good, we need challenging logic puzzles to solve everyday, keeps us alert
[11:25:17] <veQue> ^_-
[11:25:44] <BillCriswell> veQue: I'll do my best.
[11:27:30] <veQue> got a bit of a conundrum, I have working code, but the code  looks bad.
[11:27:39] <veQue> i need to finish this project
[11:27:45] <BillCriswell> veQue: That would drive me insane as well.
[11:27:59] <veQue> but i think i should continue with the project using the code that i know works
[11:28:07] <veQue> rather than trying to fix it
[11:28:12] <BillCriswell> veQue: Yeah, it can be a slipperly slope.
[11:28:19] <veQue> yeh
[11:28:31] <veQue> but it's not so bad that it cant be re worked later
[11:28:56] <veQue> i think i'll just have to take path A. keep working code even if it's redundant
[11:29:21] <BillCriswell> Yes. I hears ya.
[11:30:06] <dnyy> Is there a reason append wouldn't be updating the actual view? The HTML is updated when looking through inspect element, and console logging the div I'm appending to shows that it's working.
[11:30:15] <dnyy> wording is probably all wrong in that, but hopefully makes sense
[11:30:32] <BillCriswell> dnyy: Is it in a hidden element or anything weird?
[11:30:44] <BillCriswell> If not... I think I'd restart my browser. Crazy, but it works.
[11:30:46] <BillCriswell> Sometimes.
[11:31:12] <dnyy> BillCriswell: the element it's appending to isn't hidden, nah. the HTML that has the element that fires (on click) the append is loaded through AJAX, though, if that matters.
[11:31:26] <dnyy> it actually does what it needs to, though, just doesn't actually show. so i'm guessing that doesn't matter?
[11:31:41] <BillCriswell> dnyy: Try restarting your browser haha.
[11:31:50] <dnyy> BillCriswell: hah, will do
[11:32:16] <Ogredude> BillCriswell: that's perfect, thanks!
[11:32:30] <BillCriswell> Ogredude: Sweeeeeeet.
[11:32:47] <Ogredude> so checked just shows as an attribute of the element, that makes a bit more sense now
[11:33:27] <BillCriswell> Ogredude: Awwww yeah.
[11:33:29] <evasivx> Does any know how they acheived the responsive slider with side fades? http://www.rackspace.com/
[11:33:58] <dnyy> BillCriswell: even weirder, it works on the first time something is appended that way, but not again afterwards...
[11:34:01] <BillCriswell> evasivx: It's responsive?
[11:34:19] <BillCriswell> dnyy: Some code may help. Have it up anywhere or can you create a fiddle?
[11:34:35] <evasivx> BillCriswell, you're right, it's not, but the side fades move with it properly
[11:34:36] <dnyy> BillCriswell: I'll create a fiddle
[11:36:41] <BillCriswell> evasivx: This thing? http://www.rackspace.com/images/banners/background-curtains.png
[11:37:11] <evasivx> BillCriswell, ah, i see what they did now, just overlayed that
[11:37:14] <evasivx> Thanks :P
[11:37:20] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[11:40:19] <seion> For the Jquery validator plugin, would this rule not work ??? datePickerFrom: { required: { function() { return $("#datePickerTo").val().length > 0; } } }
[11:40:53] <seion> Im getting this error in the javascript console -> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (
[11:40:56] <seion> and its for that line
[11:41:18] <Eviltwin> You have required: { ... }
[11:41:26] <Eviltwin> Between the { ... } should be object markup
[11:41:32] <Eviltwin> Instead you've put a function
[11:41:37] <Eviltwin> This is invalid JavaScript
[11:41:52] <Eviltwin> Which plugin specifically are you using?
[11:42:04] <seion> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[11:43:14] <dorgan> does anyone know if there is a way to check if a given script exists on the page, and I can't just check for a variable defined in that script
[11:43:23] <seion> what I want is if the #datePickerTo field has a value in it then return true for required
[11:43:25] <dorgan> could i use some type of selector?
[11:43:42] <Eviltwin> snowfox_: I believe you want datePickerFrom: { required: function() { return $("#datePickerTo").val().length > 0; } }
[11:43:47] <Eviltwin> But I'm not seeing any examples here
[11:44:17] <seion> its suppose to be required: true|false
[11:44:19] <snowfox_> You mean seion
[11:44:29] <Eviltwin> dorgan: $('script') will select all scripts on the page
[11:44:30] <snowfox_> now back to my nap :P
[11:45:04] <Eviltwin> Iterate over them and use the appropriate test
[11:45:08] <dorgan> :)
[11:45:10] <Eviltwin> To see if it's the one you're looking for
[11:45:13] <dorgan> Eviltwin: thanks
[11:45:18] <dorgan> so simple I didnt even think of it
[11:55:31] <john-dev> are there any known good scripts to update content if a user scrolls under like 80%, that do not remain on a fixed div?
[11:55:54] <john-dev> like facebook does
[11:56:34] <Ogredude> john-dev: quick googling found http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[11:56:52] <Ogredude> although quick reading shows that's a wordpress plugin
[11:56:57] <Ogredude> but you might be able to strip it down for your own uses
[11:57:35] <Ogredude> john-dev: here, this one's from earlier this year even http://www.webdeveloperjuice.com/2012/05/26/10-aggressively-used-jquery-infinite-scroll-plugins-for-endless-paging/
[11:58:51] <john-dev> ok let me read that.. i onyl found results that rely on a div
[12:00:47] <john-dev> hm, looks good.. let me try those..
[12:03:02] <john-dev> awesome.. thanks..
[12:12:28] <wachpwnski> can you generate html by a template in jq/js ?
[12:12:54] <raj> if I have two different `function foo()`'s does the second call to it override the first?
[12:16:07] <Needsha> Hey all, anyone have patience for : http://jsfiddle.net/rM9yJ/1/ ? ;/
[12:18:03] <imsky> Needsha: you'll need to give the different rows of checkboxes different names
[12:18:04] <bot-t1> (19 hours 10 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky I say YO YO YO HOWS IT CRACKIN MY BROMOSEXUAL G DAWG B
[12:18:12] <imsky> i love this network
[12:21:25] <sethetter> lol, delayed messages? that's pretty awesome
[12:29:27] <xyphen_> I think I need to ask here. Regarding jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error() and jqXHR.complete() methods. Does this also involve the success, error and complete attributes in $.ajax?
[12:29:58] <shoky> xyphen_: you can use both
[12:30:04] <shoky> both will be called
[12:30:34] <xyphen_> I mean concerning the deprecation
[12:30:38] <xyphen_> of those methods
[12:31:01] <shoky> ah. i doubt it, but donno
[12:31:32] <shoky> it's safest and neatest to use .done() .fail() .always()
[12:32:32] <xyphen_> shoky: yeah, indeed but anyways let me rephrase that
[12:32:48] <xyphen_>  Does the deprecation of the jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error() and jqXHR.complete() methods also involves the success, error and complete attributes in $.ajax?
[12:33:07] <Eviltwin> If you attributes you mean properties
[12:33:09] <Eviltwin> Then no
[12:33:10] <shoky> i doubt it, but donno
[12:33:21] <shoky> now i do know
[12:34:31] <Eviltwin> Seeing as you can't use done, fail, or always in the settings object
[12:34:55] <Eviltwin> You must use success, error, or complete in the settings
[12:38:35] <xyphen_> Eviltwin: I should have said 'settings' then
[12:47:30] <xyphen_> Eviltwin, shoky: thanks guys, i'd believe it's true until another rage of deprecation arrives :)
[12:51:19] <veQue> is there a !this selector? .. i want to do the same checks for all of my text boxes. just have to check a data-x value for all of them except the current one.
[12:52:17] <shoky> veQue:  .not(this)
[12:52:31] <veQue> hmm
[12:53:59] <BillCriswell> veQue: $(this).parent('li').siblings().hide(); Could also work maybe.
[12:54:23] <veQue> ok so it would be $("[type=text]").not(this)
[12:54:28] <veQue> hmm again
[12:55:06] <veQue> ok i think i'll try the .not(this) first
[12:57:13] <BillCriswell> Are you trying to select inputs that aren't type = text?
[12:57:28] <Eviltwin> If you want to remove an element x from a collection use .not(x) on that collection
[12:58:09] <veQue> BillCriswell: no. all the things i want to select ar type= text
[12:58:17] <abletony84> Can I use jQuery to progressively resize this ads div: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/XzkEA/ (which needs a fixed width to work) - depending on the user's screen size, and whether or not the ads div is next to or below the sidebar?
[12:58:26] <Vegitto> Hello, i am looking for data in database, and if a user inserts "tele" in a field automatically sent through jquery to a sepatate php script, it finds the entry "tele", but I also want it to find "telė" and "tęlė" and all variations of e in that word with the simple search "tele". How do I do that?
[12:58:29] <veQue> but there will be one that i dont want to select
[12:58:42] <veQue> the one with data-x ==1
[12:58:48] <Vegitto> Is there an easy way to do it with jQuery, or should I rather do something sever-side?
[12:59:38] <BillCriswell> $('input[type=text]:not([data-x=1])') maybe?
[12:59:45] <veQue> Eviltwin: cool
[13:00:15] <BillCriswell> $inputs.not('[data-x=1]') is like the same thing.
[13:00:19] <veQue> BillCriswell: oh... maybe that's a good one
[13:01:37] <veQue> well truth is the function will simply be changing the values of data-x... so i think .not(this) will be better
[13:02:05] <BillCriswell> veQue: I feel like there's a lot of the big picture missing haha.
[13:02:42] <veQue> BillCriswell: no worries, the .not helped out a lot if it works
[13:02:52] <veQue> if it doesnt i'll be back with my bigger picture
[13:04:01] <BillCriswell> veQue: Good plan!
[13:04:37] <mek1> So im trying to do a thing with fancybox, using something like (.edit).fancybox how do I access the .edit object in a callback method? http://pastebin.com/DmYdx0PJ
[13:05:56] <mek1> What I want to do is to add some data to a field, based on what row you click in the table
[13:07:00] <wachpwnski> You know how you can do something like window.load in js?
[13:07:13] <wachpwnski> I want to load a window as a post, is that doable?
[13:08:16] <Eviltwin> I don't know what that means
[13:10:01] <Eviltwin> mek1: var edit = $(".edit"); edit.fancybox({ ..., beforeLoad: function() { /* Do stuff with edit */ } });
[13:10:43] <mek1> Oh .. just like I did a few rows up :(
[13:10:52] <mek1> Why can't i ever notice those things
[13:13:57] <mek1> No wait, that wont work, say I have multiple edit? How will I know which of them im using?
[13:14:06] <mek1> Wont I just be using the last one?
[13:15:10] <hugo_moss> anyone know of a good modal popup plugin that dims and doesn't flicker?
[13:16:02] <mek1> Im trying fancybox, seems "good"
[13:17:49] <Eviltwin> mek1: I would imagine in that context "this" would refer to the current fancybox element
[13:17:59] <Eviltwin> You can try setting a breakpoint inside and inspect
[13:19:45] <mek1> Yeah this will only give me the fancybox
[13:23:30] <mek1> Doing something like $(".edit").click(function () {clickedEdit = $(this).parents('tr');}); and then using the clickedEdit element, anything bad I run into doing it like this?
[13:30:05] <djsounds02> hello hello guys, http://cl.ly/text/2o1Y3o1F2M1K How can I get jquery to automatically detect these "paragraphs" and prepend and append with p tags
[13:39:20] <Caelum> how do I get all <ul> at the first level down, but not any <ul> children of those <ul>s
[13:40:41] <NoiseEee> use 'children'
[13:41:08] <JesperA> lol that sounded so wrong
[13:41:22] <NoiseEee> thank god for the quotes
[13:41:27] <JesperA> :P
[13:42:06] <Caelum> but they might not be direct children
[13:42:24] <maffelu> Are jqueryui-related questions ok in here as well?
[13:42:38] <Caelum> e.g. I might have <div id="foo"><div><ul><li><ul>... and I want only the topmost uls
[13:46:31] <mek1> Caelum: Could $("div > ul") work?
[13:48:11] <Caelum> mek1: maybe...
[13:50:42] <veQue> you know what? it's starting to make sense now. i was thinking more like a java programmer than a jquery programmer
[13:50:55] <veQue> selectors are like there's own for loop
[13:51:04] <veQue> their own
[13:51:57] <NoiseEee> they're a means of collecting elements
[13:52:04] <NoiseEee> nothing about them loops
[13:52:13] <veQue> yes
[13:52:19] <veQue> i know
[13:52:36] <veQue> dont worry, it's like an internal lightbulb moment for me
[13:53:30] <veQue> if you make the selector broad enough it can change a lot of things in one line of code
[13:53:49] <veQue> you only need multiple lines when you need to get real specific
[13:53:58] <veQue> duh right
[13:54:19] <NoiseEee> i'll hesitantly agree i suppose
[13:54:33] <veQue> well you dont have too
[13:54:56] <veQue> but i just narrowed my page of code to like 1/5
[13:55:05] <veQue> of where it started
[13:55:07] <NoiseEee> nice
[13:55:17] <NoiseEee> just make sure its readable and understandable for when you open up that code 4 months from now
[13:55:17] <shoky> just like css uses selectors to lets you style many different elements in a few lines of css
[13:55:21] <NoiseEee> shorter !== better
[13:55:34] <shoky> jquery uses selectors to let you manipulate many different elements in a few lines of js/jquery
[13:56:18] <digiv> Hi everyone, I am trying to access a function inside a jquery class (sliderion).  I am using the syntax of           $('#slidorion').sliderion.playSlider();  As you can see at http://pastebin.com/VKgd8aQ3 .  Can someone tell me what I might be missing.  The source code for slidorion is at https://github.com/hollandben/Slidorion/blob/master/js/jquery.slidorion.js
[13:56:19] <veQue> NoiseEee:  yeh i think it's pretty readable
[14:20:04] <Laban> Hi
[14:21:02] <Laban> I'm playing around with jQueryMobile and trying the popup widget. However, it closes immedietly after clicking the link that opens it. Any common clue to what's done wrong?
[14:21:13] <Laban> I can paste stuff in a few minutes.
[14:23:44] <black_warlock> hi
[14:23:59] <black_warlock> who knows how to use accordion on a random element?
[14:23:59] <gf3> HELLO
[14:27:10] <shoky> var allElems = $('*'); allElems.eq( parseInt( Math.random() * allElems.length ) ).accordion()    :P
[14:32:19] <ProLoser> hallo
[14:32:24] <ProLoser> anyone here use sortable?
[14:32:48] <shoky> ?ask
[14:32:49] <bot-t1> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:33:38] <veQue> bah, got fall through going on
[14:34:00] <ProLoser>   i have this weird bug that occurs while i'm dragging: http://cl.ly/image/3U1T3R3G2s1T
[14:35:21] <jrockjiggz> ?rehelp
[14:35:22] <bot-t1> Help us help you. Provide a test string that lists all possible variations (within reason) and then tell us what the result should be, so we don't have to guess what you want. Describe the logic in plain english if possible. Better yet, ask in#regex, they're the experts.
[14:35:36] <jrockjiggz> ah..
[14:36:17] <ProLoser> notice how the row gets pushed down?
[14:36:20] <ProLoser> i can't figure otu why
[14:36:24] <ProLoser> it occurs with ui's sortable
[14:38:59] <Raydiation> does blur also work for divs?
[14:42:53] <gf3> Raydiation: No, sorry
[14:43:23] <Raydiation> i tried focusout but it also occurs when children are focused
[14:44:57] <gf3> Raydiation: What are you even doing?
[14:45:13] <Raydiation> i want to hide a settings div if i clicked outside of it
[14:45:34] <gf3> Raydiation: OH!
[14:45:54] <gf3> Raydiation: That's easy, delegation to the rescue
[14:46:41] <gf3> Raydiation: On click, loop through the target element's 'parentNode' and check if it's your div
[14:46:49] <gf3> Raydiation: If not, hide your div
[14:48:27] <Raydiation> gf3: wouldnt i have to bind click handlers recursively?
[14:48:40] <gf3> Raydiation: No sir, do it on the body or document
[14:49:10] <drmble> hi, quick question if anyone knows the answer
[14:49:19] <gf3> The answer is no
[14:49:26] <coldhead> is the answer "17 - 21"?
[14:49:27] <drmble> dang
[14:49:37] <coldhead> that's all i got
[14:49:52] <drmble> i'm just piping captchas in here, i'm a bot...

[14:50:24] <drmble> where can I raise the issue
[14:50:26] <drmble> where can I raise the issue?
[14:51:25] <coldhead> #jQuery-content
[14:51:44] <coldhead> they're probably not fixing it because there's some shiny new version of the blog where everything is fixed forever
[14:51:49] <coldhead> coming Real Soon Now
[14:52:00] <drmble> $(rss).fix();
[14:52:11] <drmble> is that like the new plugins area?!
[14:52:29] <drmble> (checks) yeah, still on ice..
[14:52:45] <Raydiation> gf3: ty

[14:56:49] <gf3> veQue: Only my cool/patience
[14:56:50] <bot-t1> coldhead, Okay.
[14:56:53] <coldhead> thanks bot-t1

[14:57:07] <b-ot> gf3, I’ll tell Raydiation about that.
[14:57:42] <veQue> i see
[14:58:23] <coldhead> so what does everyone want for xmas?
[14:58:28] <coldhead> oh sorry, wrong window
[14:58:47] <coldhead> thought i was in #facebook
[14:59:56] <gf3> coldhead: Well considering that you're Santa Claus, I want what mommy wants
[15:01:56] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/5WGHg/10/ i need help with fall through. at any given point i want the one i click on to be 1.. if i click on a 1 i dont want anything to change.
[15:02:30] <veQue> but if i click on a 2 i want it to turn to a 1...
[15:02:56] <veQue> but the other 1 should change to a two
[15:03:16] <coldhead> gf3: a sober husband?
[15:03:19] <veQue> basically i should have a 1 a 2 and the rest should be 3s
[15:04:10] <gf3> coldhead: Kisses
[15:06:10] <coldhead> veQue: you might want to try summaring what you want to do as a comment at the start of the codfe
[15:06:12] <coldhead> code*
[15:06:21] <coldhead> i am utterly bewildered by what i am seeing
[15:06:22] <veQue> ok
[15:07:20] <veQue> coldhead: btw it should be http://jsfiddle.net/5WGHg/11/
[15:07:33] <veQue> ok i'll summarize and update
[15:07:39] <coldhead> thanks paco
[15:07:47] <Caelum> I have some conflicting css, and when I'm calling .animate({height:'show', opacity:'show'}) it does nothing, how do I force it to display?
[15:09:29] <coldhead> i don't think "show" is a valid CSS value
[15:10:16] <Caelum> or at least figure out what's causing the element to stay hidden
[15:10:32] <Caelum> well it was in this code I got from somewhere
[15:11:14] <coldhead> Caelum: consider .show();
[15:11:35] <coldhead> then you don't have to worry about how it works internally!
[15:11:42] <coldhead> it's jQuery's problem <3
[15:12:45] <Caelum> if I hover over the element that triggers the animation I can see in inspect element the style changing from display: none to display: block, but I still see nothing
[15:12:59] <Caelum> coldhead: tried that, but that just changes from display: none; to display: block;
[15:13:16] <coldhead> is there a visibility:hidden!important in the CSS perhaps?
[15:17:34] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/5WGHg/13/ coldhead
[15:17:50] <veQue> maybe that makes sense now i hope
[15:19:16] <veQue> actually writing it out kinda helped me think a bit
[15:20:31] <coldhead> brb i'm doing a wee
[15:25:21] <veQue> ok http://jsfiddle.net/5WGHg/14/ btw updated comments
[15:25:25] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> hey I wanna change the value of a something, I want it to fade out with the old value, then when it fade in with the new value
[15:25:27] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> $("#time-seconds").fadeOut().delay().fadeIn().text(60);
[15:25:36] <NICOLAS_Leonidas> I'm using this but it first changes the value, then fades out then fades in
[15:30:23] <jacoluta> is there a way to know when a function has finished executing?
[15:31:23] <ProLoser> has anyone ever noticed a bug with sortable where the siblings don't move around to accomodate the floating item?
[15:32:25] <coldhead> veQue: this is how i'd do it http://jsfiddle.net/5WGHg/15/
[15:32:31] <coldhead> using classes to make the selections easier
[15:32:34] <coldhead> and no conditionals
[15:33:20] <veQue> ok that's close
[15:33:34] <veQue> but when i click on the inital 1 or initial 2
[15:33:39] <veQue> it kinda has a bug
[15:35:10] <abletony84> I got some ads that you can flip back and forth between: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/R7BNp/
[15:35:18] <veQue> think i may have to do something with stop prorogation
[15:35:33] <abletony84> But since the ads container requires a fixed width, it's hard to position it next to the sidebar. Therefore I'm trying to dynamically resize it depending on the user's screen size, and whether or not the ads div is next to or below the sidebar.
[15:35:56] <abletony84> Can somebody take a look at my fiddle and let me know how I'm doing? A cheer or a hug would also help.
[15:37:36] <abletony84> * and whether or not it's next to or below the sidebar.
[15:39:26] <abletony84> This is gonna be a long night
[15:40:01] <coldhead> what the hell are you talking about, veQue
[15:40:04] <coldhead> this works perfectly
[15:40:06] <coldhead> you hear me?
[15:40:07] <coldhead> PERFECTLY
[15:41:19] <TelFiRE> coldhead: naw man
[15:41:32] <TelFiRE> coldhead: if you click the first box or second box first, it isn't right
[15:41:47] <TelFiRE> after the second click it sorts itself out and works permanently
[15:41:52] <TelFiRE> just the first click can bug it
[15:43:01] <veQue> TelFiRE: yeh
[15:43:29] <veQue> actually even then if you click on a one after it sorts itself out it goes back to weirdness
[15:43:41] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/5WGHg/17/http://jsfiddle.net/5WGHg/17/
[15:43:50] <veQue> this is what i get for trying to condense code
[15:43:53] <coldhead> that includes the initial classes
[15:43:59] <coldhead> in the html
[15:44:11] <coldhead> and returns immediately if you click on 1
[15:44:18] <coldhead> it's even more perfect now
[15:45:26] * veQue sends coldhead a thankyou card... but it's still bugged
[15:45:48] <coldhead> it meets MY exacting standards
[15:45:49] <veQue> maybe i'll add third
[15:45:53] <coldhead> i am giving myself a gold star
[15:46:41] <BD-> Question: i'm using .load() on a div, but it doesn't trigger. using .ready() does trigger, but I need to wait untill (external) css is loaded so .ready() is too soon. Any ideas ?
[15:47:15] <coldhead> BD-: can you use $(window).load ?
[15:47:25] <coldhead> that should fire once CSS is done
[15:47:46] <veQue> i mean the cold should be simple..... click..
[15:47:52] <Laban> I can paste stuff in a few minutes.
[15:48:00] <veQue> i'll figre this out i'll be back with the answer
[15:48:00] <Laban> whops.
[15:49:34] <BD-> wouldn't $(window).load also wait till all images are loaded ?
[15:49:43] <coldhead> yes, yes it would
[15:49:57] <coldhead> is there a specific CSS file you want to wait for?
[15:50:40] <coldhead> you may find a solution in this excellent post by the man who brough deferred()s to jQuery http://jaubourg.net/feature-testing-impossible-data-uri-and-defer
[15:51:45] <BD-> thanks, i'll check that out :)
[15:52:22] <DrDank> this is my first day even attempting to fool with jQuery.. not sure whats wrong... http://inserthtml.com/demo/rotating-menu/ works fine when I do the demo.. when I save the file and open it up.. it only plays half the animation and stops.. wont go any further?
[15:53:10] <coldhead> DrDank: do you see an error in your debugger?
[15:53:16] <coldhead> firebug or chrome web inspector?
[15:53:41] <DrDank> Nothing pops up.. in Chrome.
[15:53:45] <wachpwnski> what is the best way to make say a javascript library based on jquery
[15:54:06] <DrDank> the little + sign doesnt even show up when I open it locally.
[15:54:10] <DrDank> but when I click it, it expands
[15:54:13] <DrDank> but thats it.
[15:54:13] <coldhead> this doesn't seem to actually use jQUery, DrDank
[15:54:28] <DrDank> oh snap.. I got my files mixed up
[15:54:29] <DrDank> im sorry
[15:54:31] <wachpwnski> I use soemthing like this: if (typeof jQuery === 'undefined') { alert('jQuery is not defined.'); } in the top lib.js
[15:54:39] <wachpwnski> Does that seems sound/sand?
[15:54:42] <wachpwnski> sane*
[15:56:12] <DrDank> coldhead, --- so when I want to mess with jQuery, I Just make sure my jQuery.js file is linked up and roll with it?
[15:56:19] <coldhead> yup!
[15:56:29] <coldhead> that's reasonable, wachpwnski
[15:56:49] <coldhead> most people just assume jQuery is available and let the lack of it be known via error messages in the console
[15:56:56] <coldhead> $ is not defined etc
[15:57:40] <DrDank> coldhead, just that one file correct??? - <script src="jQuery.js"> --- thats what I got it saved as.. now I just need to figure out where to start.. lmao.
[15:58:19] <coldhead> DrDank: http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works
[15:58:25] <coldhead> that's a decent quick start
[15:59:20] <DrDank> coldhead, thanks for the advice.. I looked around the forum but their wasnt hardly any post in the beginners section.. lol --- never messed with any 'framework' before.. Thanks man!
[16:00:46] <coldhead> good luck, DrDank. #jQuery can help if you get stuck
[16:01:10] <DrDank> I'm sure I will.... lol I have no idea what does what on here.. lol lol
[16:01:19] <DrDank> all I know is it makes the web so much more awesome.

[16:03:54] <veQue> i'm sure there's another way but this works
[16:04:23] <coldhead> works but hurts to read
[16:04:27] <veQue> to be honest this code is prone to a bug if i dont initalize it right
[16:04:32] <coldhead> NEVERTHELESS, kudos to you
[16:05:08] <veQue> i mean if i dont have any data-x="2" i'm screwed
[16:06:13] <veQue> should have a response to it being invaild amount of 1s 2s or 3s... but i'm not gonna lol
[16:07:06] <veQue> hmm i guess i could
[16:07:15] <veQue> i'm sure there's a way to count selectors
[16:08:21] <veQue> if the count is != to what it's supposed to. just reset everything
[16:08:31] <veQue> hmm i'll do that later maybe

[16:09:46] <wachpwnski> If you minify your jquery code, will you break it?
[16:10:15] <coldhead> it shouldn't, wachpwnski
[16:10:34] <coldhead> i'm sure there are some crappy minifiers that will break it

[16:17:07] <GaspAWasp> Hi! quick question: does the url parameter of the $.ajax method have to be "escaped" of ampersands (converted to &amp;)? does jQuery understand the url anyway?
[16:28:07] <Hans_Henrik> does jQuery.Ajax  work on IE8+ ?
[16:28:29] <wachpwnski> It should Hans_Henrik
[16:28:45] <wachpwnski> What is going wrong?
[16:29:13] <Hans_Henrik> ah nothing, i just need something to replace FormData because of IE8+ (its supported first in IE10 -.-)
[16:29:32] <Hans_Henrik> so was thinking of using jQuery instead of XMLHttpRequest+FormData

[16:55:17] <wachpwnski> I hate css.
[16:55:31] <DT_> wachpwnski: h3 is a block element so it will take the full width. To fix, either move the button before it in the dom, float it right (http://jsfiddle.net/998Px/2/.), or make it display: inline-block
[16:56:07] <abletony84> coldhead: any idea why our fiddle stops working after pressing previous / next?

[17:00:54] <coldhead> this doesn't quite fix it but http://jsfiddle.net/R7BNp/6/
[17:01:58] <abletony84> hey thats great :)
[17:03:34] <DT_> wachpwnski: to make them both vertically centered in the container: http://jsfiddle.net/998Px/3/
[17:03:52] <abletony84> coldhead: maybe i could like.. turn it into a function and then make the cycler rerun it every time it switches?
[17:04:17] <wachpwnski> :D DT_ thanks
[17:05:16] <abletony84> got a much neater cycler by the way that i'll be implementing after this: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/vyTyn/ .. just a few lines
[17:05:59] <fission6> hmm didn't realize audio players were so scattered, doesn't seem to be a simple light weight drop in
[17:06:22] <abletony84> (compared to http://malsup.github.com/jquery.cycle.all.js)
[17:06:25] <Less_Seen> html5
[17:07:35] <coldhead> abletony84: the right place to resize the li is in a callback that runs after the cycle cycles
[17:07:53] <coldhead> or you could just do li {width:auto!important} in the CSS
[17:08:00] <coldhead> and leave it at that
[17:10:46] <abletony84> hmmm.. two wonderful options, although i think i might go for the first one.. i mean, jquery started this mess so let it fix it..
[17:13:30] <abletony84> thanks again coldhead you made my day
[17:13:51] <coldhead> oh good, i guess i can go home now
[17:13:57] <tw2113> go home coldhead

[19:09:19] <bendikrb> i have a strange problem with jquery mobile. it only affects URI's to a dialog, and only if there's a '.' in the query string
[19:09:39] <bendikrb> so "#mydialog?param=123" works, "#mydialog=param=123.3289" does'nt...
[19:09:46] <bendikrb> doesn't*
[19:20:07] <BillCriswell> bendikrb: I don't know jQuery mobile but if I can see a demo I might be able to help?
[19:36:47] <BillCriswell> Hm. jQuery mobile seems pretty sweet.
[19:41:33] <chaitime> BillCriswell, sweet like snickerdoodles?
[19:41:52] <BillCriswell> Juuuuuust like that. Whatever they are.
[19:46:25] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/nHCxU/ <-- why does plothover not work and why does it show multiple entries for the same day?
[19:53:42] <bendikrb> BillCriswell: thanks, but i figured it out
[19:53:55] <BillCriswell> bendikrb: Awesome.
[19:53:58] <bendikrb> i had to escape the punctuations
[19:54:11] <bendikrb> i guess its related to this; http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_select_an_element_by_an_ID_that_has_characters_used_in_CSS_notation.3F

[20:03:35] <donburks> slushpuppy: Do .children() instead of .contents()
[20:11:10] <recurse> evenin all ... im trying to detect the width of a body and base a condition from it. I cant seem to figure out the correct string of functions. Ive tried: 	if($("#myframe").contents().find("body").css('width') > "500px") { // do something }
[20:11:37] <recurse> but this expects a css width property
[20:11:54] <bendikrb> there's a .width()
[20:11:59] <bendikrb> or .getWidth()..
[20:12:55] <recurse> yes, ive seen these, but trying to incorporate them into what you see is proving difficult for me at the moment
[20:13:04] <bendikrb> if($("#myframe").contents().find("body").width() > 500)  { // do something
[20:13:14] <recurse> err
[20:13:18] <recurse> is it that simple ..?
