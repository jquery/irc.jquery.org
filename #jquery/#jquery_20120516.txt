[00:04:51] <kevwilde> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: :nth-child  < i get this error when i use the latest minified jquery from jquery.com :/
[00:06:57] <Dr-Bombay> make a test case and report it
[00:07:17] <elnur> Hey.
[00:07:20] <Looney> hi all, need to know some solution from cross domain GET
[00:07:33] <kevwilde> use jsonp
[00:07:35] <elnur> How can I select a checkbox in adjacent column?
[00:07:40] <tga> I'm still having some scope issues
[00:07:42] <tga> Cork, ping
[00:07:43] <Looney> kevwilde:
[00:07:56] <Looney> do they support IE and stuff
[00:08:10] <kevwilde> afaik they do
[00:08:14] <Cork> Looney: jsonp is just javascripts loading
[00:08:21] <Cork> so yes it works in all browsers
[00:08:26] <Cork> tga: whats up?
[00:08:40] <kevwilde> Looney: or you can set response headers server-side to allow cross domain calls
[00:08:41] <Looney> Cork: thanx,
[00:09:06] <vl1234> hi hi i faced some problem when am loading external html file in pop it wont to take js file............
[00:09:07] <elnur> I have two columns with checkboxes. When clicking a checkbox in one column I want the checkbox in the adjacent column of the same row checked. How should I do this?
[00:09:08] <Looney> nah, I would prefer not to bug the server-side
[00:09:13] <vl1234> wt is the problem
[00:09:25] <tga> so if in object A I call object B's deferred function
[00:09:49] <tga> Cork, maybe I'm missing the obvious, but how can I also execute the .done() function in A's scope instead of B's scope?
[00:10:43] <Cork> tga: never tried, but i would expect it to get it the same way as the rest
[00:10:44] * Cork checks
[00:13:17] <vl1234> @cork .............hi hi i faced some problem when am loading external html file in popup box it wont to take js file............may i know wt is problem
[00:14:19] <tga> Cork, http://pastie.org/3919082
[00:14:35] <tga> Cork, this is the essence of what I'm doing
[00:14:57] <tga> Cork, should I pass context as a parameter to api.login() and then return it with resolveWith(context)?
[00:16:46] <Cork> tga: action.resolve(); <--
[00:16:56] <Cork> you need to set this there
[00:17:38] <tga> Cork, my bad, actual code is 				action.resolveWith(this, {...})
[00:18:07] <Cork> tga: that should work; your sure this is the correct variable inside login?
[00:18:46] <tga> Cork, inside login, 'this' is Api
[00:18:50] <Cork> vl1234: wheres the js script tags?
[00:18:50] <tga> not Foo
[00:19:04] <larsemil> index = $('#stugkarta img').index($('.activeKarta')); this returns -1. what is it i dont understand
[00:19:33] <vl1234> @cork .............its inside of head tag only
[00:20:07] <Cork> vl1234: how are you loading the html file?
[00:20:11] <Cork> iframe?
[00:20:19] <vl1234> @cork .............no
[00:20:28] <tga> Cork, so the only way I can think of is passing a context param to each function
[00:20:31] <tga> which would be ugly
[00:20:39] <Cork> vl1234: .load?
[00:20:44] <vl1234> am loading that html page when the popup box loaded
[00:20:50] <Cork> how
[00:20:52] <vl1234> ya u r right
[00:21:11] <Cork> .load('url #id') ?
[00:21:19] <vl1234> $('#selector').load('path');
[00:21:28] <Cork> that needs a partial
[00:21:30] <tga> it is beyond painful that calling B.foo() from object A executes in B's context
[00:21:33] <Cork> you can't load a full html page that way
[00:22:09] <tga> hmm or is it
[00:22:17] <larsemil> how do i get the index of the image in container #foo that has the class .active ?
[00:22:23] <tga> or maybe it's just async that's a pain
[00:22:28] <vl1234> @cork...... then how to invoke that html page fully
[00:22:41] <Cork> vl1234: iframe
[00:22:46] <vl1234> any other method
[00:22:47] <Cork> you can't do it through ajax
[00:22:58] <Cork> its not valid
[00:23:35] <vl1234> i dont know how to use iframe concept
[00:23:37] <Cork> tga: why don't you just set this as var self = this; before you call login?
[00:23:52] <tga> how will that help?
[00:24:02] <Cork> tga: you don't need to pass this around
[00:24:22] <dman777_alter> i would like to have a white background with a blue gradient breathing animation effect as an overlay on top of it. how could i go about that?
[00:24:38] <Cork> var self = this; this.api = new Api; this.api.login(...).done(function() { self.api.other_action; });
[00:24:43] <Cork> tga: ^
[00:25:19] <stenno|work> what would be this in the function() {} scope?
[00:25:29] <Cork> api
[00:25:33] <stenno|work> ah ouch
[00:25:59] <Cork> its how this works
[00:26:27] <Cork> its js function definition
[00:28:03] <tga> seems to be working
[00:28:09] <tga> closure, right?
[00:28:12] <Cork> yes
[00:28:25] <tga> I can see why they're handy to have
[00:28:30] <Cork> :)
[00:30:23] <sadhu2012> hi
[00:30:59] <cheesypoof20> I'm trying to make anchor links submit a form. The form and anchor links are dynamically inserted, so I have been using .on instead of .click, but nothing I put in the .on function works, even echo('test') http://jsfiddle.net/jWujc/1/ Relevant code is at the bottom.
[00:37:21] <tga> Cork, alright, this looks like a final solution
[00:37:36] <yaayaa> Hi all. I have a onclick=myfunction() call that needs a page refresh BEFORE it works. In other words, I have to refresh the page with my brother so that the call actually works. Can you help ?
[00:37:39] <tga> Cork, I had lots of nested asyncs, so I ended up switching all 'this' to 'self'
[00:37:52] <yaayaa> browser :)
[00:38:26] <tga> yaayaa, that sounds unlikely, something else is going wrong there
[00:39:38] <yaayaa> I tried with Chrome, Android browser, firefox: sometimes the dynamic insertion of a widget works, sometimes I need to refresh the page before clicking the button to make it work. I'm desperate
[00:43:01] <yaayaa> Code is really simple: I have onclick=myaction(); and myaction function just append html to a given "#section", and then calls $("#section").trigger('create')
[00:43:07] <natas77> hi guys
[00:43:15] <yaayaa> what am I doing wrong ?
[00:43:17] <yaayaa> please
[00:43:29] <vlad27aug> cheesypoof20: the way you used .on is the same as if you would have used .click
[00:44:07] <vlad27aug> if you want to do something when you click links inserted dinamically you should do something like:   $('body').on('click', 'a', function() {  ... });
[00:44:35] <vlad27aug> and perhaps instead of body replace it with a more specific container
[00:45:19] <natas77> i ' m looking for a live preview function in jquery  i have a textfield and the entries shoult show up in a other plase instantly
[00:45:35] <vlad27aug> cheesypoof20: scratch that...I'm drunk
[00:45:36] <natas77> is ther a way to create this in jquery
[00:46:00] <cheesypoof20> I was going to say, isn't that what I did...
[00:46:08] <yaayaa> well, what I do not understand is that it works sometimes
[00:46:18] <patrickvw> if(data.certificaat == "ja"){
[00:46:18] <patrickvw> 		$("#resultText").html("<ul class=\"alerts\"><li class=\"error\">message</li></ul>");
[00:46:18] <patrickvw> 	}
[00:46:30] <patrickvw> for natas77
[00:47:04] <cheesypoof20> thx though :P
[00:47:05] <natas77> patrickvw: ok
[00:47:10] <natas77> is for me?^^
[00:47:33] <patrickvw> yes you understand it
[00:47:43] <vlad27aug> cheesypoof20: but is there an 'echo' function in js? or is it an internal function you created?
[00:47:50] <patrickvw> volgens mij ben je nederlands?
[00:48:02] <cheesypoof20> oh dammit its not echo its alert
[00:48:03] <cheesypoof20> im dumb
[00:48:03] <stenno|work> nej
[00:48:48] <cheesypoof20> still doesnt work
[00:49:27] <vlad27aug> then you have to make sure that selector returns something at the time you try to bind it
[00:49:41] <natas77> hmmm i am not sure if I understand it
[00:49:42] <vlad27aug> I can't see anything else wrong with that
[00:49:57] <natas77> patrickvw: hmmm
[00:50:18] <cheesypoof20> i have a live localhost server running if you think that would help you spot something :\
[00:50:19] <patrickvw> var textfieldval = $("textfieldid");
[00:50:43] <natas77> it shoul show up instantly i a other place
[00:51:17] <vlad27aug> give a link
[00:54:35] <cheesypoof20> you get my pm?
[00:57:10] <vlad27aug> :) just now
[00:57:27] <patrickvw> natas?
[00:58:33] <natas77> patrickvw: I thought you have a solution for me
[00:59:01] <patrickvw> I make an example on jsfiddle
[00:59:07] <patrickvw> one moment ok
[00:59:13] <natas77> sure
[00:59:15] <natas77> thx
[01:00:01] <Lachezar> Hello all.
[01:00:21] <Lachezar> I am having problems styling JQuery-UI components. They get very big fonts.
[01:00:31] <Lachezar> A sample page: http://pastebin.com/8R6rjhrx
[01:02:10] <natas77> guten morgen blackice2999
[01:04:37] <patrickvw> natas77:http://jsfiddle.net/patrickvw/tDFtX/
[01:05:09] <vlad27aug> cheesypoof20: I really can't see anything wrong with that
[01:05:23] <vlad27aug> there are two things that come to mind
[01:05:34] <natas77> patrickvw:  thats greate thx but the result should show up instantly
[01:05:42] <patrickvw> it does
[01:05:47] <vlad27aug> 1. maybe you load some of that elements dinamically and they are not around when you bind them
[01:05:48] <natas77> with out pressing enter or
[01:06:16] <vlad27aug> 2. there is another script that steals the click event on those elements and they don't bubble up to that container
[01:07:07] <natas77> aaaa patrickvw thats it
[01:07:11] <natas77> thx
[01:07:11] <cheesypoof20> i dont think the click event is being stolen, so i'll investigate the former first
[01:07:14] <natas77> niceeeeeee
[01:07:15] <cheesypoof20> thanks for the help
[01:07:16] <raj> if I'm trying to set a variable, but I need to use .each() to determine the variables value, do i need to put all of $somelement.each() into a function? or can I just return something from $someelem.each(function() {/*from here*/}) ??
[01:07:24] <natas77> patrickvw++
[01:07:37] <raj> cuz .each seems to just return all of $someelem's
[01:07:44] <raj> despite the function
[01:07:49] <raj> contained within
[01:08:04] <dannNiel> Hi. Is there a good Localization plugin like MooTools.Locale? Maybe which supports nested object in language file and have a variable replacement?
[01:08:12] <patrickvw> your welcome
[01:08:42] <natas77> patrickvw: oranje boven^^
[01:09:34] <patrickvw> dacht ik wel want anders heet je geen natas
[01:09:47] <patrickvw> waar kom je vandaan?
[01:09:58] <natas77> i am from germany
[01:10:07] <natas77> not from niderlands sorry
[01:10:12] <patrickvw> ah
[01:10:15] <natas77> sorry
[01:10:17] <patrickvw> ok
[01:10:48] <patrickvw> why the oranje boven?
[01:11:02] <natas77> for you my frend
[01:11:05] <natas77> :-)
[01:11:06] <patrickvw> hah
[01:11:13] <patrickvw> have a nice day
[01:11:32] <natas77> you2
[01:13:35] <raj> any takers?
[01:13:51] <stenno|work>  i am a maker, not a taker
[01:14:12] <raj> cool, can you make my little function work?
[01:14:14] <raj> :)
[01:14:33] <Cork> raj: yes you need a function
[01:14:36] <Cork> but check map
[01:14:46] <Cork> ?jquery.map @ raj
[01:14:46] <caniuse> raj: jQuery.map(): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[01:14:51] <raj> map'll just create an array
[01:15:01] <Cork> with the returned values yes
[01:15:10] <raj> i just wanna return the text found in one of the elements .each is iterating through
[01:15:26] <raj> if sometext === $(el).text()
[01:15:29] <Cork> you can't just return one
[01:15:32] <raj> that's the only one I wanna return
[01:15:32] <Cork> its a loop
[01:15:46] <_ramok1> good morning
[01:15:47] <raj> but can't I just return true or something for all the others?
[01:16:10] <Cork> raj: you could use $.grep
[01:16:24] <Cork> ?jquery.grep
[01:16:24] <caniuse> Cork: jQuery.grep(): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[01:17:23] <Cork> $.grep(function(a,i) { return i === 5; })[0].action
[01:17:32] <Cork> uh...
[01:17:36] <Cork> $.grep(arr, function(a,i) { return i === 5; })[0].action
[01:18:21] <raj> .action?
[01:18:23] <stenno|work> i wonder, could jquery not _extend_ array 'instances' so that we could do arr.grep(...)
[01:18:31] <raj> oh, hypothetical
[01:18:33] <Cork> raj: what ever you want to do with the found element
[01:18:41] <raj> k
[01:18:44] <raj> testing
[01:19:07] <Cork> stenno|work: you could, but jquery tries to stay out of native objects
[01:19:10] <Dr-Bombay> stenno: extending the standard classes in a library would be bad
[01:19:20] <varnie> is typeof(foo) == "undefined" correct checking whether variable foo is defined?
[01:19:21] <Cork> stenno|work: and its a good thing, as many libs break from things like that
[01:19:27] <stenno|work> hm i see
[01:19:44] <raj> Cork, and a jquery selector won't count as an array?
[01:19:55] <Cork> the classic for(ar in arr) {}
[01:20:08] <stenno|work> a selector is a string...
[01:20:10] <Cork> raj: a jquery object is an array
[01:20:23] <raj> yeah, it gave me a syntax error
[01:20:29] <Cork> raj: $.grep($('selector'))
[01:20:29] <raj> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .
[01:20:33] <raj> oh
[01:20:35] <raj> k
[01:21:09] <Cork> raj: but if you have a jquery object, theres a better option
[01:22:03] <Cork> raj: $('selector').filter(function() { $(this).text() == sometext; }).first();
[01:22:40] <raj> yeah, i think i like that better
[01:23:01] <Cork> it does the same thing, but the syntax is nicer
[01:23:38] <Cork> raj: opps forgot return there
[01:23:45] <Cork> raj: $('selector').filter(function() { return $(this).text() == sometext; }).first();
[01:23:53] <stenno|work> so... what about $(arr).grep ? :)
[01:24:10] <stenno|work> or $(arr).map
[01:24:11] <stenno|work> wait
[01:24:19] <Cork> that would convert arr to a jquery object
[01:24:35] <Cork> and that would try to convert it into dom elements
[01:25:09] <stenno|work> ah i see
[01:25:13] <stenno|work> right
[01:35:39] <Trisox> mmm http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4178099_460s.jpg
[01:38:49] <dwarder> i know that to exit from $.each i return false, is there a way to miss current iteration and go over to the next one
[01:38:56] <dwarder> next iteration
[01:41:13] <Famic> try continue;
[01:44:33] <sanjayb> dwarder: what if you 'return true' ? (haven't tried it, but seems like that shud work for you).
[01:45:21] <stenno|work> does continue; work in a block?
[01:45:42] <stenno|work> my guess is no :)
[01:46:54] <soee> how can i use regular expression on some input value to check if it match pattern?
[01:47:40] <raj> Cork, worked beautifully, thank you
[01:47:58] <Famic> soee: result = regex.exec(tested)
[01:53:51] <jetienne> jQuery.param(params); <- what is the parse function to parse the function jQuery.param()
[01:59:51] <Lachezar> I am having trouble wuth date picker: can't make it start with a different date.
[02:01:23] <Lachezar> Doh... I was setting altFormat, but forgot to set format.
[02:05:01] <soee> how inside regular expression i can do such thing: if string has minimum 1 sign check if first sing is from range [1-9] (so basicly validate if there is no 0 at the begining)
[02:05:22] <majd> Hey #jquery - i have a function bound to the submit button of a form, like so: http://dpaste.org/YPf4T/
[02:05:38] <andr0id1> heloooooooooooooooooooo
[02:07:34] <Famic> soee: /$[1-9]+^/
[02:07:52] <Famic> soee: /$[1-9]+.*^/
[02:08:29] <Famic> or /$[^0]?.*^/
[02:08:34] <soee> hm
[02:08:52] <soee> Famic, what the last one do ?
[02:08:52] <Famic> or /$[^0]+.*^/
[02:09:21] <Lachezar> Famic: $ and ^ the other way around: ^ at beginning $ and end
[02:09:31] <Famic> right
[02:09:32] <stenno|work> normally you do /$[1-9][0-9]*/
[02:09:40] <stenno|work> er
[02:09:44] <stenno|work> normally you do /^[1-9][0-9]*/
[02:10:09] <tocka> morning
[02:10:11] <stenno|work> Famic, that would not solve it anyway
[02:10:18] <Famic> /^[^0].*/
[02:10:19] <Lachezar> Doh... soee meant one digit, not one sign :) I was so puzzled.
[02:10:32] <Famic> /^[^0]+.*/
[02:12:49] <Lachezar> How can I make multiple datepickers with alt field, but every picker should have it's own alt field, and not bind a date picker manually for every field?
[02:13:21] <Lachezar> $('.date').datepicker({altField: <magic here?>});
[02:17:22] <majd> i get an error in the ajax call here: http://dpaste.org/YPf4T/, unless the .submit() method returns false...
[02:17:28] <majd> any ideas why?
[02:18:11] <tocka> Any ideas why image height is always being set to 0 ? http://clicks1.co.uk/twitter/
[02:19:38] <tocka> images woulbe be located in those boxes that are collapsed
[02:20:28] <Famic> tocka: try var imageHeight = $(this).height();
[02:21:14] <Famic> your .each() aonly applies what it does to the first .feedImage
[02:21:33] <Famic> as it doesn't use 'this'
[02:23:21] <tocka> Famic that doesnt seem to be the problem
[02:23:25] <tocka> ;/
[02:24:02] <tocka> I was thinking maybe its because how im loading the document, maybe instead of ready i should use load?
[02:24:37] <Famic> you should use $(document).ready(function(){...});
[02:25:58] <tocka> $(function() { = $(document).ready
[02:26:14] <Famic> ?
[02:26:14] <tocka> still, changed it and its 0000
[02:26:15] <tocka> ffffs
[02:26:28] <tocka> i mean that $(function is the same thing as ready
[02:26:43] <Famic> ??
[02:26:46] <tocka> nm
[02:26:48] <tocka> nvm
[02:26:57] <Famic> I understand what you say, I just feel it's totally wrong
[02:27:29] <tocka> :D
[02:29:13] <tocka> still nothing
[02:29:15] <tocka> arghhh
[02:31:49] <StevenCodes22> Anyone up ?
[02:33:22] <Naglik> test
[02:34:41] <StevenCodes22> http://fiddle.jshell.net/motyar/m8H3c/show/ I would like to make this so it doesn't show dots but a straight line
[02:37:32] <Famic> tocka: maybe that'll help http://atomicrobotdesign.com/blog/web-development/height-and-width-of-an-image-with-jquery/
[02:37:37] <vlad27aug> set a width for that span to the distance the mouse moved...and rotate that span to match the slope of the "move"
[02:38:09] <majd> hey everyone - i spent way too long trying to resolve this issue: i get an error in the ajax call here: http://dpaste.org/YPf4T/, unless the .submit() method returns false...
[02:38:15] <StevenCodes22> Anyone ?
[02:38:16] <majd> what's going on???
[02:38:30] <vlad27aug> StevenCodes22: see my last comment
[02:38:56] <StevenCodes22> vlad27aug,  Ok mind helping me go about this ?
[02:39:15] <Cork> majd: you have another event listner in the page?
[02:39:59] <majd> Cork: i don't
[02:40:12] <Cork> majd: whats the error?
[02:40:38] <Cork> majd: btw is Dajaxice.service.get_hash the ajax call?
[02:41:23] <majd> Cork: it's an error from the dajax library that i'm using - Dajaxice.service.get_hash gets a complicated hash from the server and is supposed to put it in the form
[02:41:49] <majd> Cork: if i call the same 3 lines, in the js console, they work just fine
[02:42:00] <Cork> majd: so the flow is form > submit > ajax > response > formupdate > full page submit?
[02:42:03] <majd> only when they're bound to .submit() do i get the rror
[02:42:18] <majd> Cork: exactly
[02:42:45] <Cork> majd: most likly Dajax uses async ajax (it should)
[02:42:48] <StevenCodes22> vlad27aug,  I got it
[02:43:05] <majd> Cork: yeah
[02:43:05] <Cork> then your submit event finnish before your ajax call does
[02:43:15] <Cork> majd: so you need to stop the submit event
[02:43:26] <Cork> wait for the ajax response, THEN retrigger the submit
[02:43:27] <majd> Cork: righttttttt
[02:43:52] <majd> so the the submit should be the last line of the ajax callback function
[02:43:53] <Cork> else its form submit > ajax > form full submit > ajax response :(
[02:43:55] <Cork> *:)
[02:44:05] <Cork> majd: no
[02:44:19] <Cork> majd: you need to completly halt the submit event, and then trigger a new one
[02:45:22] <Cork> $("form).submit(event) { var form = this; event.preventDefault();   Dajaxice.service.get_hash(add_hash, {'timestamp': now, /* when done form.submit(); */}); });
[02:45:26] <Cork> majd: ^
[02:51:52] <tocka> How could I change the code that it would be executed without clicking http://pastebin.com/CnQRGUF7
[02:51:53] <tocka> ?
[02:53:09] <Cork> remove the .click handler and use handler instead of this
[02:53:38] <Cork> or if you need to have that part of the code, just do handler.click()
[02:54:06] <tocka> handler(function(){
[02:54:11] <tocka> Corey like this ? ^
[02:54:13] <Cork> no
[02:54:31] <Cork> you know how jquery works right?
[02:54:34] <Cork> the basics?
[02:54:41] <tocka> Kind of..
[02:55:00] <Cork> then just remove the event listner and run your code instead
[02:56:15] <Famic> tocka: for what' you were trying to do in the first place, you need to understand how .each() works. If you don't reference 'this' in it there's no use in it
[02:57:03] <dannNiel> Hi. Is there a good Localization plugin like MooTools.Locale? Maybe which supports nested object in language file and have a variable replacement?
[02:57:03] <majd> Cork: great - just need to figure out how to undo the event.preventDefault() when the form is actually ready for submission
[02:57:26] <Cork> majd: like i said, you can't
[02:57:39] <Cork> majd: the event has already ended
[02:57:56] <Cork> majd: you need to trigger it again like i stated in the line form.submit()
[02:59:43] <_ramok1> is there a way to show a pdf in a div?
[03:00:08] <Cork> depends if the user has a pdf plugin loaded
[03:00:20] <Cork> btw no
[03:00:26] <grid_> _ramok1: try #html :)
[03:00:27] <Cork> pdf would have to be in an iframe
[03:00:40] <Cork> unless you render the pdf in js
[03:00:58] <majd> Cork: but if i do $("form").submit(), the same function that stops the submit event will be called again, so i need to find a different way to trigger the submit event
[03:01:01] <_ramok1> Cork: an iframe would be okay
[03:01:09] <_ramok1> but how to load it into the iframe?
[03:01:18] <Cork> just give the iframe the url
[03:01:45] <Cork> majd: no not $('form')
[03:01:56] <Cork> majd: check the code i gave you
[03:02:28] <majd> Cork: what does this line do? var form = this;
[03:02:29] <majd> ?
[03:03:03] <Cork> majd: it saves a dom reference to the form dom
[03:03:07] <tocka> Famic im not using .each () anymore
[03:03:28] <StevenCodes22> Cork,  http://jsfiddle.net/AJS5y/ Is there a way I could make this kill some of the drawing so it creates a little line that folllows the mouse ?
[03:03:28] <Cork> majd: if you get a callback from the ajax function and can populate it to the submit event
[03:03:38] <Cork> majd: use it in there form.submit();
[03:04:54] <Cork> StevenCodes22: you need to save and reset the canvas
[03:05:29] <StevenCodes22> cork alright
[03:07:35] <tocka> Cork i really cant figure it out..
[03:07:41] <StevenCodes22> Cork,  Like http://jsfiddle.net/AJS5y/1/
[03:14:25] <StevenCodes22> Can anyone help me with Canvas ?
[03:18:26] <andr0id1> hey guys, i have the following: i am pulling data from a db using php. now, how to dinamically get the id so i can do some calculations?
[03:19:44] <whateverb> how to get each working with height separately for each row? http://jsfiddle.net/2qF6w/19/ Goal is to get the lowest height of ul in every .row and set the others the same
[03:20:03] <whateverb> but separately every row for its own lowest height ul
[03:22:21] <majd> Cork: thanks for all the help so far - i'm still trying to wrap my head around asynchronous functions (and js in general)...
[03:22:28] <StevenCodes22> Guys can anyone help me remake this http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/trail/03/
[03:23:12] <majd> Cork: here's what i have so far, would you be able to reply to the paste on dpaste.org with the correction? http://dpaste.org/p0RWt/

[03:24:31] <ablomen> StevenCodes22, http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/trail/03/js/trail.js << there you go
[03:25:56] <quicksilver> pif: $('img').click(function(){$('textarea').val($('textarea').val()+$(this).attr('title'));});
[03:26:10] <quicksilver> alter selectors to be more precise as appropriate.
[03:26:49] <pif> quicksilver: nice, but this will replace the contents of the textarea, no?
[03:27:05] <pif> oops, no
[03:27:08] <pif> never mind
[03:28:18] <whateverb> can somebody help me here? http://jsfiddle.net/2qF6w/19/ Goal is to get the lowest height of ul in every .row and set the others the same
[03:28:23] <tocka> can someone tell me how to do this "then just remove the event listner and run your code instead" ? I cant get the damn thing working.. I want it to change the dimensions of the images without clicking http://pastebin.com/sVtb8Qhj
[03:28:23] <pif> is there a way to insert text at the cursor's current position in the textarea?
[03:32:52] <quicksilver> pif: search for "caret" here : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/946534/insert-text-into-textarea-with-jquery
[03:33:12] <pif> right
[03:33:16] <pif> thanks

[04:02:18] <krillep> which is the best way to store a pdf around ~4mb in sqlite with javascript? I have tried using base 64 encoding but the Andoid browser freezes and quits when trying to open large files. Small files won't open either they just start to download but the download never completes and the filetype seems to be unknown.

[04:09:58] <ARUN___> if jQuery has been loaded, we can know if it exists by checking window.jQuery : similarly, how do we know that jquery-ui has been loaded ?
[04:11:58] <Cork> ?eval window.jQuery.version
[04:11:58] <caniuse> Cork: 'ReferenceError: window is not defined'
[04:12:02] <Cork> ?eval jQuery.version
[04:12:02] <caniuse> Cork: 'ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined'
[04:12:13] <Cork> hmm thought it had jquery...
[04:12:47] <Cork> ARUN___: jQuery.ui and jQuery.ui.version
[04:14:33] <ARUN___> Cork : can we just try jQuery.ui ?
[04:15:04] <ARUN___> I mean, if jQuery-ui has been loaded, then perhaps we should check out if window.jQuery.ui exists or not
[04:15:13] <ARUN___> I'm not sure though
[04:16:05] <Nece228> hello
[04:16:08] <StevenCodes22> stevencodes.herobo.com I'm trying to get the canvas behind everything :p
[04:16:16] <Nece228> how to select the value of form input?
[04:16:20] <ARUN___> after loading jQuery-ui, when I type (typeof window.jQuery.ui) in console... it says an object
[04:16:34] <ARUN___> $('input').val()
[04:16:53] <ARUN___> Nece228, you can access the value of form input through $('input').val()
[04:17:07] <Nece228> ARUN___: thank you sir
[04:17:09] <Nece228> ill try
[04:17:19] <ARUN___> lol
[04:19:47] <ARUN___> btw, Cork: window.jQuery.version is undefined.
[04:21:33] <cheeseduck> How can I make it so that when an item is selected in the autocomplete thing with jqueryui, it submits the form?
[04:23:13] <Nece228> $.post('submit.php', {guestbook_name: 'nindzinai', guestbook_mail: 'haha', guestbook_text: 'mes nindzes'}, function(data) {});
[04:23:18] <Nece228> whats wrong with this line?
[04:23:47] <cheeseduck> Abusing JavaScript for something where it's not needed?
[04:24:19] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: you can pass a callback function such as function(){ $('form').trigger('submit'); }
[04:24:45] <cheeseduck> Hmm...
[04:25:01] <ARUN___> Nece228: I don't see anything wrong with the code.. but you aren't doing anything with the data which your received
[04:25:10] <Nece228> yeah i know
[04:25:22] <Nece228> but for some reason it doesnt send succesfully data to server
[04:26:42] <Nece228> ah it works
[04:26:50] <Nece228> wrong variable name it was
[04:26:53] <Nece228> thanks anyway
[04:26:56] <Nece228> for checking
[04:27:07] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: The code I have: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=rC6iuZz0
[04:28:17] <NoReGreT> what can I use in order to know if a certain class belongs to an element that might have several classes
[04:28:46] <vlad27aug> .hasClass
[04:29:08] <cheeseduck> I have read an advanced book on JavaScript twice recently, but I still find the jQuery syntax very bizarre.
[04:29:26] <stenno|work> its normal javascript syntax...
[04:29:33] <vlad27aug> NoReGreT: $('my_element').hasClass('my_class')
[04:29:37] <cheeseduck> Very bizarre IMO.
[04:29:39] <stenno|work> you normally just pass callback functions
[04:29:44] <NoReGreT> vlad27aug: thanks
[04:29:50] <cheeseduck> But could you help me extend the code I have with the functionality I requested?
[04:29:57] <StevenCodes22> stevencodes.herobo.com I'm trying to get the canvas behind everything :p
[04:30:10] <stenno|work> i cannot do that, because i need to work
[04:31:16] <vlad27aug> StevenCodes22: z-index:-1;
[04:31:37] <StevenCodes22> vlad27aug,  But then my body background image is in the way
[04:32:52] <Nece228> cool my code is working
[04:33:05] <poppiez> how do you modify an event object so that when it bubbles up its parents can see what got modified?
[04:33:18] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: you want to autocomplete then submit the form automatically ?
[04:33:35] <Nece228> now i need to find a way that to fadein that record which i store in mysql
[04:33:38] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: I want the form to submit once an autocomplete option has been picked.
[04:33:41] <Nece228> basically need to retrieve it
[04:34:37] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: w8 while I take a look
[04:34:47] <vlad27aug> StevenCodes22:  set canvas z-index: 1;
[04:35:09] <vlad27aug> set wrapper z-index: 2; position:relative;
[04:36:05] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: Thanks... it's a big mystery to me.
[04:36:10] <cheeseduck> Even after reading the manual.
[04:36:14] <Nece228> how to output something to html?
[04:36:28] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: yeah, I'm reading the documentation too to figure it out :)
[04:36:32] <Nece228> .html i think isnt needed now
[04:36:47] <Nece228> because it selects something and replaces
[04:37:00] <Nece228> i dont need to replace i need to add something
[04:37:11] <vlad27aug> Nece228: .append
[04:37:32] <StevenCodes22> vlad27aug,  Thanks alot bro
[04:37:48] <vlad27aug> StevenCodes22: welcome
[04:37:50] <Nece228> thanks ill try
[04:39:35] <Nece228> it works
[04:39:56] <Nece228> but i would like if the text would be outputted on the top of certain div, not on the bottom
[04:41:28] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: this helps ? : $( "#test" ).autocomplete({    select: function(event, ui) { $('#test').trigger('submit'); } });
[04:42:10] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: the function will be triggered whenever an autocomplete option has been picked
[04:46:31] <ARUN___> Nece228: you can use .prepend just in the same way you used .append
[04:46:54] <ARUN___> it'll insert contents at the beginning
[04:48:07] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: Let me try.
[04:48:18] <Nece228> ARUN___: thanks its working
[04:48:32] <Nece228> you probably use some secret supernatural powers that you know so much
[04:48:32] <ARUN___> Nece228: nice to know that :)
[04:48:58] <ARUN___> Nece228: LOL
[04:49:37] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: Wait... is that second #test supposed to be the id of the form?
[04:50:20] <ARUN___> oh, i made a mistake, it should be like this $( "#test" ).autocomplete({    select: function(event, ui) { $('form').trigger('submit'); } });
[04:50:56] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: oh, i made a mistake, it should be like this $( "#test" ).autocomplete({    select: function(event, ui) { $('form').trigger('submit'); } });
[04:51:11] <cheeseduck> So "form" here is not any kind of ID?
[04:51:13] <cheeseduck> Just "the form".
[04:51:23] <ARUN___> yeah
[04:52:25] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: Okay... it worked in the sense that it submitted the form upon selecting the autocomplete item, BUT... it sent the incomplete value that I input -- not the one from the autocomplete list.
[04:52:43] <cheeseduck> So I typed "t", got the list, and selected "teeeest-item", and it submitted the form with "t" as the value.
[04:52:47] <cheeseduck> Instead of "teeeest-item".
[04:55:03] <ARUN___> hmm..
[04:58:38] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: embed this code within the funtion before triggering submit : $('#test').trigger('autocompletefocus') and see if it works ?
[04:59:19] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: $( "#test" ).autocomplete({    select: function(event, ui) { $('#test').trigger('autocompletefocus'); $('form').trigger('submit'); } });
[04:59:28] <Nece228> how to retrieve time from the server?
[04:59:38] <Cork> Nece228: ajax call
[05:00:54] <Nece228> Cork: you mean this? http://www.builders-buddy.co.uk/images/AJAX%20GLASS%20CLEANER.jpg
[05:01:09] <daum> on http://bit.ly/L5OSXp if I run http://pastie.org/private/pentq3nkbb6grf0kmxqq why does my 'click' on the nextPageLink not actually cause the page to change?
[05:01:21] <Zhy> Nece228 xD
[05:01:21] <Cork> Nece228: yup, don't forget svinto
[05:01:46] <Cork> Nece228: http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3465/3374386309_a224eb68f8_z.jpg
[05:02:01] <daum> it is definitely finding the proper link..but just seems something is intercepting the click even?
[05:02:02] <daum> event
[05:02:24] <Cork> daum: you can't fake click a link
[05:02:44] <Nece228> Cork: well im spraying ajax on monitor but nothing happens, wonder why
[05:03:04] <Nece228> Cork: ok, ill try with svinto see how it feel work
[05:03:09] <Cork> Nece228: rubb it a bit with svinto, i'm sure that helps :)
[05:03:16] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: I think that won't work.. trying using this : $( "#test" ).autocomplete({    select: function(event, ui) { $('#test').val(ui.item); $('form').trigger('submit'); } });
[05:04:11] * cheeseduck tests.
[05:04:21] <Nece228> Cork: lets hope svinto will work
[05:05:22] <McLovin477> hello I want to select the first li element in an unordered list and then insert html before it... is this the right approach? http://pastebin.com/SZBP3B6c
[05:05:31] <Cork> Nece228: joke aside, $.ajax({ url:'/time', cache: false, dataType: 'json' }).success(function(data) { console.log(data.time); });
[05:05:42] <McLovin477> the #jobs is the id of the ul
[05:05:43] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: That last thing caused the value to become "[object Object]".
[05:06:02] <Cork> Nece228: then responde with a json object with the servers time to the /time url
[05:06:48] <Nece228> Cork: oh, thanks ill try
[05:07:13] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: I also tried your previous suggestion. Also just submits the incomplete string.
[05:07:21] <Cork> Nece228: or you could just go with text if you don't want the structure
[05:08:10] <Nece228> i will see which will work bettetr
[05:08:30] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: $( "#test" ).autocomplete({    select: function(event, ui) { console.log(ui.item); $('form').trigger('submit'); } }); and check what comes up in console
[05:09:27] <varnie> is this phrase correct: "what an amazing day!"?
[05:09:51] <varnie> sorry, wrong channel:))
[05:10:46] <vlad27aug> varnie: seems correct anyway :)
[05:11:26] <varnie> ;) thanks
[05:12:16] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: Nothing shows up in Error console.
[05:14:26] <ARUN___> cheesseduck: try using this : $( "#test" ).autocomplete({    select: function(event, ui) { setTimeout(function(){ $('form').trigger('submit'); }, 500); } });
[05:14:56] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: try using this : $( "#test" ).autocomplete({    select: function(event, ui) { setTimeout(function(){ $('form').trigger('submit'); }, 500); } });
[05:15:29] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: this might perhaps wait for the input element to change its value then submit
[05:17:26] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: That seems like such an ugly hack... I thought this was gonna be dead simple.
[05:18:11] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: yeah, agreed.. unfortunately, the autocomplete feature hasn't yet provided enough customizations
[05:18:26] <MindSpark> hi, I am using scrollTo to scroll inside a slider. Is there anyway I can find out which section is currently showing?
[05:18:50] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: Actually, that last thing worked.
[05:19:00] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: Thanks, but I feel like it's "just barely working". ;S
[05:19:57] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: yeah, this might not be good idea, though its working.. we need to figure out some better way :)
[05:21:04] <vlad27aug> MindSpark: you can get the scrollTop or scrollLeft value of the thing that scrolls to know how much it is scrolled...maybe that is enough
[05:21:21] <cheeseduck> ARUN___: By we, do you mean "we, right now", or "we, the jQuery/jQueryUI team, at some point"?
[05:21:47] <MindSpark> vlad27aug, by the thing, do you mean the container?
[05:22:01] <ARUN___> cheeseduck: I think they haven't yet provided us with necessary customization options, so definitely them :)
[05:22:24] <ARUN___> jQueryUI team
[05:23:33] <cheeseduck> JavaScript really has some bizarre things going on.
[05:23:45] <cheeseduck> All these "wrapping anything in anything" concepts.
[05:23:49] <vlad27aug> MindSpark: yes...and if that isn't enough you can compare that value with the offset of the 'sections'
[05:24:22] <ARUN___> haha yeah, unfortunately it is
[05:25:01] <leipie> Hey! I have have a problem that manipulating the dom from an event triggered function, near where an event triggered, triggers a second event in chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/yYNqT/2/
[05:25:11] <MindSpark> vlad27aug, perfect, thanks a lot!
[05:44:50] <vlad27aug> leipie: that is because that when the submit event occurs it also makes the input to blur
[05:47:39] <vlad27aug> this is something that happens in webkit browsers
[05:50:16] <vmassuchetto> How can I update the innerHTML of a dynamically inserted element?
[05:50:40] <kingnebula> vmassuchetto, the way you do of any other element
[05:50:55] <vmassuchetto> kinesis, That is not working.
[05:51:20] <vmassuchetto> someelement.parent().append('the html element');
[05:51:49] <kingnebula> should work. i dont know what you are doing wrong
[05:52:32] <vmassuchetto> then: anotherlement.keydown(function(){ someelement.html('new html'); });
[05:55:23] <leipie> vlad27aug the second event only occurs if I manipulate the dom, else only one event is triggered
[05:56:28] <leipie> vlad27aug it has no relation to the submit triggering a blur
[05:56:51] <vlad27aug> leipie: what do you mean by manipulating the dom?...and the event triggers twice anyway from the fiddle if I click inside the input and then hit enter (no dom manipulation)
[05:57:19] <leipie> vlad27aug: notice the difference between http://jsfiddle.net/yYNqT/2/ and http://jsfiddle.net/yYNqT/3/ in chrome
[06:02:07] <vlad27aug> I see...well you manipulate the dom with this $('#count').html(++triggered); also...I think that the focus goes to the new added element...and webkit triggers a blur event while non-webkit browsers avoid that

[06:14:31] <Qasim> any body here with jquery and CSS selectors?
[06:16:55] <Zhy> Uhm Qasim... what exactly do you mean with active? you can use .focus() but I don't know whether that's what you are looking for
[06:17:30] <rroelofs> Qasim: :active is a css  pseudoclass  that doesn't have a js equifalent
[06:17:57] <rroelofs> for mouse interactions it is equifalent to the mouseDown
[06:17:58] <Qasim> so rroelofs how can I do that in jquery?
[06:18:06] <Lachezar> Qasim: ACTIVE is a state, while FOCUS is both a state and an event. ACTIVE does not have an event
[06:18:28] <diverdude> Anybody knows how i can trigger the fileupload of a plupload using the same button as the user uses to browse for the files, so that the user needs only a pick files button, and not both a pick files button and a upload files button?
[06:18:56] <stenno|work> what is a plupload?
[06:19:22] <diverdude> stenno|work: a plugin
[06:19:36] <stenno|work> jquery plugin?
[06:19:40] <rroelofs> Qasim: Take a step back.  What is the task you are trying to acoplish?
[06:19:44] <stenno|work> or vanilla javascript?
[06:20:58] <Qasim> @Lachezar so i have ths navigation with home having a class called (active-trail) i have other navigation lists as a height i want that specific button with that class have a different height
[06:21:02] <Qasim> is it possible?
[06:22:08] <Qasim> @rroelofs so i have ths navigation with home having a class called (active-trail) i have other navigation lists as a height i want that specific button with that class have a different height
[06:22:41] <Qasim> and I want to do it with jquery event or anything if possible
[06:23:05] <rroelofs> Qasim: why not use plain css.
[06:23:46] <Qasim> the thing is I have given animation to it
[06:23:52] <Qasim> if I accomplish this
[06:24:19] <Qasim> I will give each list item a different animation
[06:24:48] <rroelofs> so you currently have a hover() function that handles this bue you want it to work for people using their keyboard?
[06:25:41] <Qasim> yes
[06:25:54] <huglester> Guys, I have 5 profiles on the page, and I want to change images like: change image on profile1, then profile2, then profile3.. etc.. Maybe someone has a link to share where I can borrow some 'preloading' ideas etc?
[06:27:53] <rroelofs> Qasim: you need to .on("focus") and .on("blur")
[06:29:20] <Qasim> @rroelofs I have inspired from this link (http://tympanus.net/codrops/2009/12/08/beautiful-slide-out-navigation-revised/)
[06:31:11] <rroelofs> but it doesn't handle keyboard nav so there's no help there.
[06:31:38] <Qasim> yeah
[06:31:51] <Qasim> I have achieved exactly that navigation
[06:31:58] <Qasim> but with different style
[06:32:17] <Qasim> and now I want the active link showing and the others hidden
[06:38:39] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/78097419
[06:39:08] <Nece228> this line: $(data).find('#time')
[06:39:26] <Nece228> it should select text which is in #time div
[06:39:43] <Nece228> that file submit.php echoes it as html text
[06:41:34] <rroelofs> Nece228: $("#time") will be faster, and if you just want the text insicde that div, $("#time").text()
[06:43:41] <Nece228> rroelofs: well it doesnt work
[06:44:25] <Nece228> keep in mind that i need to select #time div which is in submit.php file
[06:44:51] <Nece228> not in local file in which script executes
[06:45:27] <rroelofs> Nece228: sorry about that.  you still need .text() to get the text contents of it
[06:46:04] <Nece228> well it outputs me nothing
[06:46:47] <Nece228> if i do just $("#time") it outputs me [object Object]
[06:48:03] <rroelofs> Nece228: that's because you have a jQuery object, but it may have no content
[06:48:31] <Nece228> i guess
[06:48:39] <vlad27aug> Nece228: try to output $("#time").length to check that it selected something
[06:49:19] <Nece228> it gave me "undefined"
[06:49:39] <rroelofs> I've never used jQuery to extract bits from an ajax return data.  Are you sure your data is coming back as html rather than plain text?
[06:49:43] <velcrobots> morning.  i'm building this pretty cool feature for our site and i'm wondering if someone can help me out.  once a user is scrolled down the collage pretty far, is there a way i can have the list in the right column appear at the top of the screen, versus the top of the column?  http://bjtonline.com/lists
[06:50:04] <Nece228> heres what submit.php outputs
[06:50:30] <Nece228> <div id="time">04:52:50</div>
[06:51:08] <Nece228> i send a .post request to submit.php
[06:51:50] <Flo0815> hey guys. i have a div, containing different elements: <div><a></a> <p></p></div>. how can i insert a new element after <a> ?
[06:51:57] <vlad27aug> Nece228: well that is not the answer I expected...it should be a jquery object...so it should have an integer set for the length field
[06:51:57] <rroelofs> Is that the entire output?  If so you could easily treat it as text and extract what you need
[06:52:00] <Nece228> im sending form data to that file, but i also need to retrieve that div
[06:53:13] <vlad27aug> I think you copied exactly what I wrote...you should check this $data.find("#time").length
[06:53:20] <vlad27aug> sorry$(data)
[06:54:39] <Nece228> it outputed me 0
[06:57:24] <rroelofs> Flo0815: $("div").find("a").after(...)
[06:58:10] <rroelofs> Nece228: that means it is not finding #time inside data.  My guess it that it isn't treating data like html
[07:00:00] <Nece228> rroelofs: then what method is it treating?
[07:00:38] <rroelofs> what do you get if you add console.log(data) in your callback?
[07:01:33] <Nece228> when i did $(data).text
[07:01:46] <Nece228> it outputted me function (a){return f.access(this,function(a){return a===b?...
[07:01:48] <Nece228> and so on
[07:02:23] <rroelofs> Nece228: that is the contents of the text function.  you want to output $(data).text()
[07:03:04] <vlad27aug> rroelofs: yes...that was the problem
[07:03:09] <Nece228> rroelofs: boom you got it
[07:03:14] <vlad27aug> $(data) was already the #time element
[07:03:18] <Nece228> $(data).text() outputs the time
[07:03:20] <Nece228> yay
[07:03:34] <Nece228> finally its working
[07:03:48] <vlad27aug> that means that $(data).find(#time) would look for a #time element inside the #time element...which obviously doesn't exist
[07:04:02] <rroelofs> exactly
[07:04:05] <Nece228> hmm
[07:04:09] <Nece228> this is some weird stuff
[07:04:45] <Nece228> but when i do $(data).text() it outputs me not only whats inside time div, but also other text
[07:06:21] <rroelofs> Did you try console.log(data) yet?
[07:06:26] <Nece228> no
[07:06:28] <Nece228> where to put it?
[07:07:37] <rroelofs> first line of callback (make a new line before $("#content")...
[07:07:52] <velcrobots> wondering if someone can help me out.  once a user is scrolled down the collage pretty far, is there a way i can have the list in the right column appear at the top of the screen, versus the top of the column?  http://bjtonline.com/lists
[07:10:29] <Nece228> ok ive put it
[07:10:48] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/46832953
[07:10:53] <Nece228> thats output
[07:10:58] <Nece228> when i have
[07:11:06] <Nece228> $(data).find('#time').text()
[07:15:04] <vlad27aug> velcrobots: you should try with position:absolute;
[07:15:16] <rroelofs> Nece228: that isn't even close to valid html.  I have no idea what jQuery will make of it.
[07:15:44] <vlad27aug> or did you mean you want to keep the column in the viewport whenever you scroll?
[07:16:06] <vlad27aug> in this case you should use position:fixed;
[07:16:35] <Nece228> rroelofs: what do you mean valid html?
[07:17:36] <vlad27aug> rroelofs: it is close to valid html...all that it needs to be valid is a 'title' tag
[07:17:38] <velcrobots> member:vlad27aug: no, not always when you scroll - i tried that, it doesn't work with really long lists.  just the top of the list, i would like it to appear at the top of the viewport instead of having to scroll all the way back to the top of the page
[07:19:09] <diverdude> i do jQuery.parseJSON(response); to make json string to js object. How do i do it the other way around?
[07:19:45] <ajpiano> ?stringify @ diverdude
[07:19:46] <bot-t> diverdude, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[07:19:52] <encoded> grettings and salutations!
[07:20:23] <anli_> Is it possible to call a function from a popup?
[07:20:28] <encoded> im a js/jquery noob
[07:20:36] <encoded> http://www.darreningram.net/pages/examples/jQuery/CollapsiblePanelPlugin.aspx im following this tutorial
[07:20:40] <anli_> Or to send a function object to a popup
[07:20:58] <encoded> i want to add an arrow to the header to indicate expanded/collapsed
[07:21:25] <encoded> can someone help me?
[07:21:28] <vlad27aug> velcrobots: position:fixed; should do it
[07:22:22] <velcrobots> vlad27aug: position fixed on the column with the list in it?
[07:22:29] <Flo0815> hey how can i check if a div contains the element #player? it's in a subdiv
[07:22:49] <vlad27aug> velcrobots: psoition:fixed; on whatever you want to hold in the viewport
[07:22:56] <encoded> also, i have a div inside a td(dont lol) can i make it expand to fill the td ?
[07:22:58] <velcrobots> won't that be a problem when all the way at the top?
[07:23:22] <encoded> height:100% width:100% doesnt seem to do it
[07:23:38] <Flo0815> can somebody help me please? i think it's not that complicated
[07:24:18] <rroelofs> vlad27aug: Sorry for the wait, real work intrudes...  Actually it has no body element either which is much worse
[07:24:28] <velcrobots> vlad27aug: that also won't work with a list that's longer than the viewport is tall
[07:24:30] <vlad27aug> velcrobots: you can check when the scrollTop is higher that a value (the distance from the top of the viewport to your list) and if it is then readjust the scrollTop of the list to that value
[07:25:21] <Flo0815> hey how can i check if a div contains the element #player? it's in a subdiv
[07:25:51] <fabius> Flo0815: Use find() ?
[07:26:01] <vlad27aug> Flo0815: $('container_div #player').length
[07:26:07] <encoded>  im following this tutorial http://www.darreningram.net/pages/examples/jQuery/CollapsiblePanelPlugin.aspx how can i add an arrow(image) to indicate expanded/collapsed
[07:26:47] <Flo0815> when i use find() it gives me the nothing in the console
[07:27:03] <Flo0815> consoloe.log(find()...) -> []
[07:27:31] <fabius> Flo0815: vlad27aug's answer is probably better just to find out if the element exists.
[07:27:32] <vlad27aug> Flo0815: does the container div has a class or an id?
[07:27:41] <Flo0815> vlad27aug: no
[07:27:57] <Flo0815> and i can't use your answer because i have an object for this element
[07:28:14] <Flo0815> so like $(box).find('#player'); gives me -> []
[07:28:24] <vlad27aug> put a class or an id on it and check that $('.my_container_div_class #player').length > 0
[07:29:01] <Brodingo_> Flo0815 a jquery object will always be a truthy object
[07:29:15] <Brodingo_> use .length to check if the element actually exists
[07:30:08] <vlad27aug> or if you already have the div selected in a jquery object you could use find like fabius said
[07:30:35] <vlad27aug> something like mySelectedDiv.find('#player').length > 0
[07:31:36] <theoN^> Hmm I have an ajax slider with configuration options that loads a new table in every slide. I use the :odd selector on the table rows to create a zebra pattern, but when I load my next slide, my jquery apparently doesnt start over from the start of the table but remembers the last :odd selector, which causes my zebra patterns to start off with the wrong colour sometimes. Anyone who knows a solution to that ?
[07:31:46] <anli_> I am trying to call a function with window.opener.func(), but I get an error message about the window not supporting that property
[07:31:48] <fabius> Flo0815: Or you could do something like $('#player', mySelectedDiv).length > 0
[07:31:53] <anli_> Why?
[07:32:13] <anli_> $('#player mySelectedDiv).length > 0 would also do
[07:32:17] <anli_> oops
[07:32:24] <anli_> $('#player .mySelectedDiv).length > 0
[07:32:37] <anli_> forget it :)
[07:39:27] <symbol> Hey guys! short question! Is it possible to use console.log() to show the actual DOM-Object i'm in? I can't access a specific DOM-Object from there :/
[07:39:50] <Hooloovoo> depends on the browser/dev tools
[07:39:51] <theoN^> symbol, why not? you can just console.log a jquery selector
[07:40:02] <theoN^> atleast in firebug/default chrome afaik
[07:40:13] <Hooloovoo> ya, i know chrome does it
[07:40:20] <theoN^> firebug does too afaik
[07:40:20] <Hooloovoo> and ie doesn't
[07:40:23] <symbol> i'm using chrome and the default tool.
[07:40:34] <theoN^> well who tests in IE to debug to start with ?
[07:40:36] <Hooloovoo> symbol: then just console.log() away
[07:40:44] <diverdude> I have this piece of small jquery code for doing an ajax call: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/2093135112 but for some reason no data is sent. I have verified that JSON.stringify(jcrop_api.tellSelect()) actually returns a string so thats not the problem. What am I doing wrong?
[07:40:50] <Hooloovoo> theoN^: well, usually i don't but when i test in ie i do.
[07:41:04] <symbol> but i can't select the needed div...so i wanted to see where "I am" in this situtaion. It's a $.ajax callback
[07:41:16] <theoN^> Hooloovoo, true, when something doesnt work in IE but does in the rest of the browsers you're forced to debug in there ofc, but I really hate it nonetheless :p
[07:41:28] <Hooloovoo> theoN^: agreed!
[07:41:32] * Lachezar looks around puzzled:
[07:41:33] <Hooloovoo> symbol: explain =P
[07:41:43] <Hooloovoo> what do you want to console.log()?
[07:42:11] <theoN^> if you console.log a jquery selector you'll get an object, you can always do .html() after the selector and log that instead if that's what you need?
[07:42:16] <Lachezar> It seems I have to fix the font-size to something hard-coded in pixels in order to have the JQuery theme look as expected... Damn HTML+CSS.
[07:43:21] <symbol> i'm creating a table with a dynamic amount of rows...each row will call an $.ajax request and get's a callback. Then i need to select the only relevant object in the specific table row. Is it nearly understandable? I'm not a nativ english speaker (german)
[07:43:53] <theoN^> "only relevant object in the specific table row" => explain
[07:44:05] <Hooloovoo> symbol: sounds kinda backwards. i'd get the content of the rows first then generate the table from that
[07:44:08] <theoN^> because it really comes down to that
[07:44:08] <Hooloovoo> but ok
[07:45:07] <velcrobots> wondering if someone can help me out.  once a user is scrolled down the collage pretty far, is there a way i can have the list in the right column appear at the top of the screen, versus the top of the column?  http://bjtonline.com/lists
[07:45:56] <theoN^> symbol, I still don't get completely what exactly you want to console.log(), what exactly is it? You want to log a specific element in a row when it exists, or what?
[07:46:06] <diverdude> i do jQuery.parseJSON(response); to make json string to js object. How do i do it the other way around?
[07:46:38] <huglester> how can I get image.src load time..?
[07:46:44] <Hooloovoo> diverdude: google "jquery tojson"
[07:47:22] <diverdude> Hooloovoo: tojson? whats that
[07:47:29] <theoN^> what you need.
[07:47:41] <danzik17> diverdude: JSON.stringify .
[07:48:26] <diverdude> danzik17: i already use JSON.stringify. Here: data: JSON.stringify(jcrop_api.tellSelect()),
[07:48:53] <danzik17> diverdude: then what's your question?
[07:49:05] <symbol> theoN^, i will prepare a pastbin. sec
[07:49:41] <context> mm can you use [value=] in css selectors ?
[07:49:50] <diverdude> danzik17: nothing is sent to the server
[07:49:52] <theoN^> symbol, if it's just to know what DOM element you're inside of you could just do this: console.log($(this).parent());
[07:49:56] <diverdude> danzik17: i dont understand why
[07:51:03] <symbol> theoN^, then i'm getting []
[07:51:19] <diverdude> i think problem is on server
[07:51:20] <danzik17> diverdude: presumably you have a parameter name that your data should map to, or are you trying to read the input stream directly?
[07:53:08] <symbol> the point is that i'm going thru every <td> in this table with .each an sending a $.ajax for each row. Then i want to hide/show a div in every row when i'm getting the successful callback
[07:54:46] <theoN^> symbol, pastebin ?
[07:55:19] <symbol> sec
[08:01:43] <symbol> theoN^, http://pastebin.com/7KemeerY
[08:02:02] <velcrobots> wondering if someone can help me out.  once a user is scrolled down the collage pretty far, is there a way i can have the list in the right column appear at the top of the screen, versus the top of the column?  http://bjtonline.com/lists
[08:02:52] <theoN^> symbol, this doesnt say much, you process every table cell, I got that, yeah
[08:03:01] <theoN^> oh
[08:03:03] <theoN^> there's more
[08:03:09] <theoN^> I didnt see the scrollbar, 1 sec :P
[08:03:30] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody have any idea why the first event's AJAX works but the second doesn't? http://pastebin.com/yUr7dPRm
[08:03:51] <theoN^> symbol, #downloadsongs isn't anywhere in the markup, I suppose you accidently left it out ?
[08:04:07] <theoN^> or is that supposed to  be the button you click ?
[08:04:42] <symbol> that's the button which will be clicked to start the whole process
[08:06:08] <theoN^> symbol, $(this).attr('songname') => There's no attribute like that ?
[08:07:07] <symbol> i cutted the .attr()'s out to make it a little bit easier to read.
[08:07:26] <theoN^> so it would be like
[08:07:34] <theoN^> <td songname="your song name">
[08:07:36] <theoN^> ?
[08:07:36] <symbol> they are inside of the <td>s in front of the songname
[08:07:39] <symbol> yes
[08:07:56] <theoN^> first off, there's no html valid attribute called songname for td's
[08:08:09] <theoN^> if you want to store data in a DOM element use the HTML5 data- attribute
[08:08:15] <theoN^> for example
[08:08:25] <theoN^> <td data-songname="Your song">
[08:08:45] <symbol> oh okay
[08:09:28] <theoN^> secondly, I don't see why you'd need to store data in your TD as your data is right there for the taking in your <b> element
[08:09:37] <theoN^> unless you want different formatting of course
[08:11:26] <symbol> yes i should access to the values inside the td's but for the first time it would work. i have to optimize the code anyways
[08:11:45] <theoN^> if that's the case, you could get your song to log by doing this: console.log($(this).find('b').text())
[08:12:20] <theoN^> symbol, no point in doing things twice, do it the right way straight off, will save you time and will make your syntax be better organized
[08:13:05] <theoN^> Try what I just suggested, it should work
[08:13:41] <symbol> the problem is that i'm using more than one parameter in this.
[08:13:52] <theoN^> in what ?
[08:14:24] <theoN^> you can always filter with the .is() and .not() filters
[08:15:17] <ajpiano> is isn't a filter
[08:15:25] <ajpiano> it returns a boolean
[08:15:29] <theoN^> it's not a filter, you're right
[08:16:13] <symbol_> it's just working right now but the problem itself isn't solved right now :/ i'm still not able to acces the element :(
[08:17:06] <theoN^> What element ... you still havent told me what exactly you want to access
[08:19:08] <symb0l> sorry for posting code -.-
[08:19:26] <symb0l> so the div with the loading.gif.
[08:20:23] <theoN^> you need that to show and it doesnt ?
[08:21:24] <simbol> theoN^, i'm loosing my inet-connection often.. did you wrote sth?
[08:21:28] <theoN^> yep
[08:21:36] <theoN^> you need that (loading.gif) to show and it doesnt ?
[08:22:00] <simbol> it is showing but i want to fadeout when the callback was succesful
[08:22:48] <theoN^> simbol, you're working in a closure, you'll need to hand "this" to it
[08:23:13] <theoN^> you can do that by doing something like: var that = this
[08:23:17] <theoN^> wait, I'll do it in pastebin
[08:23:23] <simbol> ok thx :)
[08:24:35] <theoN^> simbol, http://pastebin.com/k3UBTwe1
[08:25:08] <theoN^> it won't work like that as I just used your code, but the part you should pay attention to is on line 41 ... and later on in line 47
[08:25:27] <theoN^> oh darn,
[08:25:37] <theoN^> forgot to set "var" before "that"
[08:25:47] <theoN^> line 41 would be "var that = this"
[08:31:11] <encoded> hi, sorry for asking again but

[08:31:38] <encoded> yes im a js/jquery noob
[08:33:07] <rroelofs> encoded: add it to your css.  I'm betting you are already setting a class when it gets expanded or collapsed
[08:34:05] <encoded> i tried using .collapsibleContainerTitle .collapsed but it didnt work
[08:36:46] <encoded> rroelofs: any other hints or guidance are apreciated
[08:37:14] <encoded> maybe i can .addClass or something?
[08:37:40] <fRAiLtY-> Yo, can anyone help here: When you select from drop-down 1 it should highlight a column, then drop-down 2 highlights a row with the cross-point a diff colour. It all works except the highlight on the column http://jsfiddle.net/6eUQb/6/
[08:37:49] <Nece228> hello
[08:37:51] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/6195652
[08:38:00] <Nece228> fadeIn animation doesnt work
[08:38:25] <Nece228> y o y u no work?
[08:38:30] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[08:41:26] <rroelofs> encoded: I presumed wong.  the code is just setting display: block and display: none
[08:44:45] <encoded> so in CollapsibleContainerTitleOnClick()
[08:44:58] <encoded> should i modify the class ?
[08:45:42] <rroelofs> You would need to add a callback to slideToggle() to set the class after the animation is done
[08:46:05] <encoded> ah.... how do i do that ?
[08:46:54] <encoded> again i apologize for my noobness
[08:47:20] <SeanLazer> does checking/unchecking a checkbox still not fire the change() event?
[08:47:48] <andr0id1> hi, why during the use of jquery validator i dont see my messages i have defined, instead i see : this field is required?
[08:48:16] <rroelofs> .slideToggle("slow", function() { $(this).toggleClass("collapsed");})
[08:48:43] <rroelofs> encoded: oops, that's not quite right.
[08:49:33] <thinkt4nk> SeanLazer I don't believe so.  You could trap the click event on checkboxes and fire a change event on them, if you wanted
[08:49:38] <hlveheart> http://pastebin.com/Ezgfmkfx ... Why isn't the jquery on the bottom properly checking the radio on click?
[08:49:54] <andr0id1> oh, found it. how to show my custom messages instead the ones defined in the jquery.validate.js?
[08:50:01] <rroelofs> encoded: try .slideToggle("slow", function() { $(this).parent().toggleClass("collapsed");})
[08:50:25] <SeanLazer> thinkt4nk: ah, that'll work i guess.  can't believe there's still not a proper event for this
[08:50:35] <encoded> i add that to my $(document).ready(function () { ?
[08:50:57] <SeanLazer> thinkt4nk: especially since capturing click still doesn't work if the user is keyboarding around
[08:51:08] <hlveheart> Anyone?
[08:51:09] <hlveheart> o.o
[08:51:24] <encoded> hlveheart: have pacience
[08:51:35] <encoded> *patience
[08:51:55] <SeanLazer> hlveheart: i don't think that's how you select a radio button with jquery
[08:52:09] <hlveheart> http://www.mkyong.com/jquery/how-to-select-a-radio-button-with-jquery/
[08:52:12] <hlveheart> that's what they say
[08:52:12] <hlveheart> lol
[08:52:21] <zatan> hey how can I do for example $('.foo').next().next()   instead of two next there is anything like ".next(2)" ?
[08:52:29] <rroelofs> encoded:  nope.  find the slideToggle in the plugin click function and replace it with the one I sent.  That wil add and remove the 'collapsed' class so your css can hook in.
[08:52:55] <bil> zatan you can use a selector with next()
[08:53:39] <thinkt4nk> SeanLazer it actually looks like 1.7.2 fires change on click
[08:53:56] <thinkt4nk> SeanLazer http://jsfiddle.net/Gbw2d/
[08:54:01] <SeanLazer> thinkt4nk: hmm, that's what i'm running, must be something else going on
[08:54:57] <bil> zatan also http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[08:55:09] <thinkt4nk> weird, I've tried all the way back to 1.4.4, and it works, but I've always bound click
[08:55:13] <zatan> cheers bil
[08:55:17] <hlveheart> o_O?
[08:55:20] <hlveheart> anybody?
[08:55:28] <SeanLazer> thinkt4nk: ah ha, i'm actually running .on('change,keyup')
[08:55:41] <SeanLazer> thinkt4nk: that seems to break it
[08:55:51] <thinkt4nk> ah, should be .on('change keyup') I believe
[08:55:52] <encoded> rroelofs, thank you!
[08:55:57] <thinkt4nk> does that work?
[08:56:13] <jm_s2s> I am trying to figure out how to do a tooltip on a jqplot graph, I have it working but it is displaying the x axis coordinate not the tick value http://pastebin.com/FiwCqmEh
[08:56:30] <SeanLazer> thinkt4nk: yes, that works.  dohhhhhh
[08:56:33] <SeanLazer> thinkt4nk: thank you
[08:56:34] <thinkt4nk> haha, nice
[08:56:37] <thinkt4nk> any time!
[08:56:55] <SeanLazer> thinkt4nk: i guess all my other fields were happily responding to my keyup event and i didn't notice that "change," is meaningless
[08:57:26] <thinkt4nk> yep
[08:58:05] <hlveheart> http://pastebin.com/Ezgfmkfx ... Why isn't the jquery on the bottom properly checking the radio on click?
[08:59:30] <ajpiano> hlveheart: it's nth-child or eq, not nth
[08:59:35] <ajpiano> also put quotes around the attribute name
[08:59:38] <ajpiano> and use prop instead of attr
[09:00:55] <hlveheart> So... $('input:radio[name="AppReqCat"]:nth-child(1)').attr('checked', true);
[09:00:55] <hlveheart> ?
[09:01:11] <ajpiano> .prop("checked", true)
[09:02:07] <hlveheart> Still didn't work
[09:02:07] <hlveheart> ;|
[09:02:12] <Amel> Hello, I have a website with very simple jQuery actions. I use the get function to get info from another page and display it in a div. This works well, but when I try it on my school computers that use Internet Explorer, it doesn't load. What could it be? Bad IE support?
[09:02:22] <andr0id1> can anyone help me with jquery validator?
[09:02:29] <hlveheart> No errors popping up in console, either
[09:02:55] <ajpiano> hlveheart: debug your selector
[09:02:57] <ajpiano> is it matching any elements etc
[09:02:59] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/VA6MC/1/  Is there anyway to have dynamic UI dialogs by classes instead of id's?
[09:03:12] <fRAiLtY-> Yo, can anyone help here: When you select from drop-down 1 it should highlight a column, then drop-down 2 highlights a row with the cross-point a diff colour. It all works except the highlight on the column http://jsfiddle.net/6eUQb/6/
[09:04:05] <arnpro> hey guys, what event will fire first when you toggle a checkbox? click or change?? please see this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/arnpro/SgHfv/
[09:06:49] <thinkt4nk> arnpro click will fire first
[09:07:05] <ajpiano> arnpro: you should always use change event for checkboxes
[09:07:07] <ajpiano> not click
[09:07:36] <arnpro> thinkt4nk: if you run the code, it doesnt... why?
[09:07:49] <ajpiano> arnpro: there are no checkboxes in that example
[09:08:02] <ajpiano> arnpro: adn ootools is loaded into that fiddle, not jquery and jquery ui
[09:08:23] <thinkt4nk> ajpiano just out of curiosity, why should you always use change instead of click?
[09:08:34] <thinkt4nk> portability?
[09:08:44] <ajpiano> thinkt4nk: because you want to react to the fact that it's changed
[09:08:50] <ajpiano> maybe via  keyboard or something
[09:08:55] <thinkt4nk> ah, so semantic soundness
[09:08:59] <ajpiano> click is a quirky way to deal with it
[09:09:01] <ajpiano> exactly
[09:09:12] <thinkt4nk> yeah, I dig that
[09:09:16] <thinkt4nk> thanks
[09:09:38] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: yes, it's possible to have dynamic dialogs
[09:10:04] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: you would do like, this.next().dialog("open")
[09:10:26] <GoGoGarrett> I'm trying that currently - getting no firebug errors
[09:10:31] <GoGoGarrett> but it simply doesn't open the dialog
[09:10:40] <ajpiano> debug the elements you're selecting
[09:10:48] <ajpiano> see if $(this).next() is getting anything
[09:10:53] <ryanneufeld> one does not simply open a dialog
[09:10:55] * ryanneufeld ducks
[09:11:18] <thinkt4nk> lmao @ ryanneufeld
[09:11:19] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/VA6MC/2/
[09:11:25] <GoGoGarrett> alrighty
[09:11:53] * european-guy hi
[09:12:01] <arnpro> sorry guys lost connection
[09:12:12] <arnpro> ajpiano: there are checkboxes Im sure: http://jsfiddle.net/arnpro/SgHfv/
[09:12:21] <ajpiano> arnpro: i was looking at th wrong fiddle sorry :p
[09:12:30] <arnpro> np :P
[09:12:52] <ajpiano> arnpro: why are you trying to have a click on the checkbox
[09:14:17] <GoGoGarrett> ajpiano: for some reason the div.preview is no longer in the dom so next() isn't finding it
[09:14:38] <GoGoGarrett> but if I uncomment the dialog definition it shows up
[09:15:02] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: $(this).next()
[09:15:08] <GoGoGarrett> I've tried both
[09:15:29] <ajpiano> well the latter definitely doesn't work
[09:15:30] <ajpiano> so
[09:15:33] <ajpiano> let's find out what's actualyl wrong
[09:16:29] <MindSpark> can I use * in my selectors?
[09:16:44] <Brodingo_> you can, but should you? no
[09:16:45] <ajpiano> you can, it's not really "a greak idea"
[09:16:48] <ajpiano> great*
[09:16:56] <d[^_^]b> do it
[09:17:19] <GoGoGarrett> I think the problem is
[09:17:25] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/PCNUx/  this is the view source
[09:17:32] <GoGoGarrett> of that section, and the div.preview isn't there
[09:17:35] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: so two things
[09:17:59] <ajpiano> i think that part of the problem is that once the element gets made into a dialog, it gets moved to the bottom of the dom
[09:18:06] <MindSpark> Brodingo, and ajpiano why not a good idea?
[09:18:15] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, I think that's what's happening
[09:18:23] <ajpiano> the second problem is that you are trying to pre-embed the dialogs in the DOM
[09:18:35] <ajpiano> instead of just generating them dynamically or reusing the same one :p
[09:19:03] <arnpro_> ajpiano: sorry the chat is behaving strange
[09:19:10] <Brodingo_> MindSpark * has terrrrible performance
[09:19:16] <arnpro_> ajpiano: did you read my last?
[09:19:16] <ajpiano> arnpro_: i just asked why you are trying to use click
[09:19:19] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah I didn't know an easier way, so i'm basically creating a div with the full image, so they can click and it'll show in a dialog with the full sized image
[09:19:31] <ajpiano> MindSpark: not only is not great for perf, it also is just very vague
[09:19:40] <MindSpark> Brodingo, ah, so nothing to do with things going wrong...?
[09:19:54] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: i can show you
[09:19:57] <MindSpark> ajpiano, I am thinking about using it in conjunction with :eq
[09:20:00] <Brodingo_> not explicitly, but as ajpiano things can get out of hand
[09:20:07] <ajpiano> MindSpark: that's even worse :(
[09:20:17] <MindSpark> ajpiano, lol, ok
[09:20:20] <ajpiano> MindSpark: what selector are you planning to use
[09:20:24] <ajpiano> cause for instance
[09:20:25] <hlveheart> How would I go about adding a class to an element, and ensuring it's removed from 5 other elements on the page, without having to removeclass on each of the others?
[09:20:32] <ajpiano> what you are thinking of $("#foo > *:eq(2)")
[09:20:53] <jm_s2s> Is anyone good with jqplot?
[09:20:53] <MindSpark> Instead of calling children() and using that, I was thinking about $('#selector *:eq(7)')
[09:20:55] <ajpiano> coudl just be written as $("#foo").children().eq(2)
[09:20:58] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:21:04] <ajpiano> it's a lot better to do children eq
[09:21:09] <ajpiano> the selector and everything is just a lot faster
[09:21:14] <ajpiano> cause :eq is not a native selector
[09:21:21] <NoiseEee> hlveheart: like remove a class without removing a class?
[09:21:22] <ajpiano> so it has to go through sizzle even on new browsers
[09:21:25] <MindSpark> ajpiano, ah, there's a function eq too!
[09:21:35] <ajpiano> hlveheart: there's no way to remove a class from an element beside removing it from the element
[09:21:37] * hlveheart slaps ajpiano around a bit with a large trout
[09:21:37] <ajpiano> MindSpark: yep :)
[09:21:47] <hlveheart> you're my favorite jquery wizard
[09:21:50] <MindSpark> ajpiano, perfect, I'll use that! thanks a lot
[09:22:12] <Brodingo_> nobody ever pays me in slaps
[09:22:24] <ajpiano> hlveheart: :)
[09:22:27] <hlveheart> ;D
[09:22:32] <hlveheart> Btw, got it working.
[09:22:40] <hlveheart> $('input:radio[name$=AppReqCat]').filter('[value="Accounting"]').prop('checked', true);
[09:22:49] <hlveheart> ASP makes things difficult
[09:23:15] <hlveheart> But yeah, my next problem.
[09:23:19] <hlveheart> How would I go about adding a class to an element, and ensuring it's removed from 5 other elements on the page, without having to removeclass on each of the others?
[09:23:32] <ajpiano> you have to removeclass on each of the elements
[09:23:36] <hlveheart> Yuck
[09:23:44] <ajpiano> hlveheart: are all the elements whose state you're toggling on the page statically
[09:23:46] <hlveheart> Will it error out if the class isn't existant?
[09:23:48] <ajpiano> or do they come and go dynamically
[09:23:49] <ajpiano> no
[09:24:09] <hlveheart> statically though
[09:24:10] <hlveheart> yes
[09:24:24] <ajpiano> hlveheart: ok  then the best thing you can do is like
[09:24:28] <ajpiano> in pseudocode:
[09:24:40] <hlveheart> It just means I end up having to write 5 remove classes.
[09:24:48] <hlveheart> for 6 functions ll
[09:24:48] <hlveheart> lol
[09:24:52] <ajpiano> nope
[09:25:18] <hlveheart> one sec.
[09:25:22] <hlveheart> uploading my current code.
[09:25:34] <ajpiano> var allTheThings = $("li');  function setTheThings( thingToChoose ) { allTheThings.removeClass( "whatever");  allTheThings.filter( thingToChoose).addClass("whatever");  });
[09:26:47] <hlveheart> http://pastebin.com/hknMwEqk
[09:27:05] <hlveheart> i know that's ugly
[09:27:05] <hlveheart> lol
[09:27:18] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: reusing the same dialog or creating it on the fly is a little bit of a pain cause you're using the backend to template out the image first
[09:27:31] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, I think i'm making progress
[09:27:41] <ajpiano> there is an approach you can do
[09:27:42] <GoGoGarrett>       $content = $(this).find('.preview').html;  $('<div />').html($content).dialog();
[09:27:43] <GoGoGarrett> Something like this?
[09:27:47] <ajpiano> which is to save the relationship to the dialog at the time it's created
[09:27:50] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: yes, that's one way to do it
[09:28:05] <GoGoGarrett> not working exactly correct, but i'm still trying things haha
[09:28:23] <hlveheart> ajpiano, see my code up there?
[09:28:50] <ajpiano> hlveheart: zomg
[09:28:52] <hlveheart> Lol
[09:28:55] <hlveheart> don't judge
[09:29:02] <hlveheart> It was in a pretty function before, and it wasn't working
[09:29:15] <hlveheart> Right now, it works. as bulky as it is
[09:30:24] <hlveheart> the problem is, each item isn't finished yet, either. Each of the functions toggles a different modal
[09:30:29] <hlveheart> so it has to be in different functions
[09:30:59] <ajpiano> a "different modal" insofar as...it it is still a modal just with a different name?
[09:31:18] <hlveheart> basically, the $('#AppReqFrm').modal('toggle').hide().fadeIn();
[09:31:30] <hlveheart> the #AppReqFrm is going to be different on each function
[09:31:35] <hlveheart> I have 6 different modals
[09:32:03] <ajpiano> hlveheart: one sec i'm just finishing up something for GoGoGarrett
[09:32:08] <hlveheart> lol alright
[09:32:11] <hlveheart> take your time dude :p
[09:32:20] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/PCNUx/3/
[09:32:24] <GoGoGarrett> This is what I have currently
[09:32:44] <XeQTr> Heya. So i'm wondering a tiny thing. I've written this CRM-system and would now like the customers to be able to design their invoices on their own. Is there a neat way of, with like drag and drop, creating a html-page that i could convert into pdf?
[09:33:14] <Amel> Dragging elements can be done with draggable() using jquery-ui
[09:33:20] <Amel> But I'm not sure what you're asking, beyond that
[09:33:35] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: this is what you can do if you just want to embed them in the dom how you were before http://jsfiddle.net/VA6MC/4/
[09:33:43] <XeQTr> hmm, might become a tricky thing to solve then :)
[09:34:17] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: that's definitely works, you just have to take care make sure the dialogs get cleaned up
[09:34:37] <GoGoGarrett> Awesome thanks a lot man
[09:34:38] <ajpiano> by doing close: function() { $(this).dialog("destroy").remove() }
[09:34:44] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: however, you can also just have a single dialog :)
[09:35:09] <GoGoGarrett> how do you just have a single one though haha
[09:35:20] <GoGoGarrett> The content is dynamic with a backend
[09:35:28] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: like this http://jsfiddle.net/PCNUx/6/
[09:35:45] <ajpiano> you just replace the content before you use it :)
[09:35:51] <ajpiano> then you don't have to clean up after each one
[09:36:10] <ajpiano> all 3 approaches work as you can see
[09:37:41] <ajpiano> hlveheart: so each modal will be like... #IndusSpecFrm, #ConnectorsFrm
[09:37:42] <ajpiano> ?
[09:38:01] <hlveheart> ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/JKe19dNF (Updaetd)
[09:38:08] <hlveheart> Updated*
[09:38:08] <hlveheart> lol
[09:38:14] <hlveheart> But yes, ideally
[09:38:29] <hlveheart> I just made this as an example, saying AppReqfrm1, 2, 3 etc.
[09:38:32] <ajpiano> yeah man this number shit sucks :p
[09:38:51] <ajpiano> hlveheart: the point is yes, as you know in your heart of hears right now, this code can definitely be DRY'd up
[09:38:56] <GoGoGarrett> I can't get it working sadly
[09:39:01] <GoGoGarrett> but i'll keep woring with it, thanks a lot
[09:39:02] <ajpiano> you just have to figure out what's different, and make that work
[09:39:05] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: ok, good luck
[09:40:31] <hlveheart> Other then compression of size of the code, is there any upside to it being in a single function?
[09:40:43] <hlveheart> Functionality-wise, it'll work either way.
[09:40:54] <hlveheart> It's just a lot of excess coding
[09:41:00] <hlveheart> but then again, it's not something that'll be changing
[09:41:06] <ajpiano> the knowledge that you have a graceful solution to your problem that scales automatically as new buttons are added
[09:41:07] <hlveheart> So it doesn't need to be maintained, really
[09:41:11] <ajpiano> the point is
[09:41:18] <ajpiano> do you want to know how to solve this problem generically
[09:41:22] <ajpiano> cause maybe this doesn't need to be maintained
[09:41:34] <ajpiano> but this isn't gonna be the last time you're gonna have to deal with what fundamentally is this interaction :p
[09:41:50] <hayer> anyone know of a jQuery plugin that will let me do something like this; http://www.cs-norge.no/ at the top of the content
[09:41:53] <hlveheart> Oh, totally. I guess I'm just stuck
[09:41:56] <hlveheart> lol
[09:42:01] <ajpiano> hlveheart: ok just gimme a min :p
[09:42:05] <hlveheart> Thanks :P
[09:42:20] <darcyclarke> hayer a slideshow?
[09:42:54] <hlveheart> hayer: there are tons. http://slodive.com/freebies/best-jquery-slideshow-gallery-plugins/
[09:44:07] <catcher> hayer, looks like that one in particular is http://smoothgallery.jondesign.net/
[09:44:29] <ajpiano> hlveheart: ".hideappreq" is the class of *all* the modals? i presume?
[09:45:04] <hlveheart> No, seperate. I have a div with that class that hides part of the form
[09:45:16] <hlveheart> It's really messy, and I can't really show you in code form, as it isn't deployable yet
[09:45:18] <hlveheart> ;|
[09:45:19] <nFFF> Do you not control the markup hlveheart ?
[09:45:26] <ajpiano> ok np
[09:45:57] <hlveheart> one sec, let me atleast show you what it looks like
[09:46:06] <ajpiano> its fine
[09:46:15] <ajpiano> what ever i'm doing is basically for example purposes only and you'll prob have to tweak it
[09:46:56] <ajpiano> and i'm assuming you can change the modals to have a class like "modal" and an id like "something-modal"
[09:48:07] <hlveheart> Yep
[09:49:50] <ajpiano> hlveheart: obviously this is not guaranteed to work as is
[09:49:51] <ajpiano> http://pastebin.com/hkXGb585
[09:49:55] <ajpiano> but it should show you the approach
[09:50:13] <ajpiano> you basically want to save all the stuff you're gonna use up front
[09:50:25] <ajpiano> and then filter through it in the event based on the piece of information that you know is different
[09:50:56] <hlveheart> Seriously, you are a wizard.
[09:51:01] <hlveheart> Thank you so much
[09:51:14] <hlveheart> I'm gunna toy with this and see if I can get it to work on this form.
[09:51:27] <ajpiano> hlveheart: ok
[09:51:28] <hlveheart> Much cleaner, different approach then I was going at when I was trying to make it a single function lol
[09:51:38] <ajpiano> just think of it as future problem solving technique
[09:52:01] <ajpiano> cause believe me i have implemented this exact thing like a bajillion times, it comes up a lot :p
[09:52:25] <hlveheart> ;P.

[10:31:23] <BrotherRodriguez> Sz01: Do you have any code that you're working with? Like something on jsfiddle.net?
[10:35:09] <Evil_Otto> Is it possible to trigger a form's .submit() event more than once?

[10:35:50] <Sz01> sorry for the dely
[10:36:39] <rainerbird> Hi! I'm trying to find a method for getting a variable in the Javascript source URL. For example <script type="text/javascript" src="code.js?cat=Henry"></script>
[10:36:47] <rainerbird> how do I get the variable "cat" in my code?
[10:36:49] <rainerbird> thanks
[10:37:13] <Sz01> i need a script that if i press on "opt1" the iframe goes to "./[opt1].html"
[10:38:27] <BillCriswell> rainerbird: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/get-query-string-values-in-javascript
[10:38:52] <rainerbird> thankyou heaps!
[10:39:32] <Sz01> if someone knows how to help me i'll apreciate it
[10:39:53] <Evil_Otto> I have a form with a function assigned to its .submit() event.  The first time I submit the form, the function runs as intented, with an event.preventDefault() preventing normal submission of the form
[10:40:09] <Evil_Otto> But the second time I submit the form, it doesn't run the function, it submits as normal
[10:40:58] <Sz01> the comented code on the fiddle page, works fine but not on IE...that's why i don't use it any more :S
[10:41:22] <Sz01> i need it to work on IE more than nothing
[10:42:17] <rainerbird> hi
[10:42:31] <rainerbird> back to my first question,  I'm trying to find a method for getting a variable in the Javascript source URL. For example <script type="text/javascript" src="code.js?cat=Henry"></script> [19:36] <rainerbird> how do I get the variable "cat" in my code? [19:36] <rainerbird> thanks
[10:42:58] <Evil_Otto> didn'
[10:43:06] <Evil_Otto> err didn't BillCriswell answer that?
[10:43:12] <rainerbird> The answer I was giving I think is more for getting parameters from the current window URL, not the actual js url. see how I have js?cat=henry
[10:43:18] <rainerbird> yes, I read the stack overflow post
[10:43:39] <rainerbird> but correct me if I'm wrong that's for getting paremters from the current url, not from the js calling url
[10:44:06] <BillCriswell> Evil_Otto: http://jsfiddle.net/QFy7D/2/ This allows multiple submissions... are you rewriting the form?
[10:45:30] <Evil_Otto> What i'm doing is writing out several hidden divs with content in them that I want to swap in and out with a visible div
[10:46:00] <Evil_Otto> so to start with there's the form in the div, then the form submits, and the contents of the visible div are replaced with the contents of one of the hidden divs
[10:46:28] <Evil_Otto> but, there's a link in the contents of one of the divs that causes the 'form' content to be put into the visible div
[10:46:39] <BillCriswell> rainerbird: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4716612/how-do-i-get-query-string-value-from-script-path seems to be the closest thing. Many other places just suggest a global.
[10:46:58] <Evil_Otto> and when I submit the form after that, that's when it submits as normal
[10:47:10] <Evil_Otto> as if the event isn't attached to the submit event anymore
[10:47:20] <BillCriswell> Evil_Otto: The hidden div is on the page when you run the $('form') part.
[10:47:33] <rainerbird> thanks! this is what I was looking for :)
[10:47:45] <kbanman> I'm using the blur() event to hide a menu. Is there an easy way for that not to be called if the reason for the blur() is the whole window losing focus?
[10:48:09] <Evil_Otto> BillCriswell: is that a question?
[10:48:27] <BillCriswell> Yes.. Forgot the "is" and the question mark haha
[10:48:39] <BillCriswell> The essentials of a question.
[10:48:51] <Evil_Otto> BillCriswell: all the content is on the page when the function is assigned to the .submit() event
[10:49:09] <BillCriswell> Hmm...
[10:49:17] <NoiseEee> Evil_Otto: you're assigning it wrong
[10:49:24] <Evil_Otto> eh?
[10:49:57] <NoiseEee> $('#form').submit(function(etc) { })  <--- actually submits the form.  to watch for the submit event, it's $('#form').on('submit',function() {});
[10:50:22] <kbanman> NoiseEee: Not if you return false in that function
[10:50:56] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: That doesn't submit the form.
[10:51:59] <BillCriswell> Evil_Otto: Have some HTML we can look at
[10:52:00] <BillCriswell> ?
[10:52:10] <Evil_Otto> in any case doesn't the event.preventDefault(); keep the form from submitting/
[10:52:11] <Evil_Otto> ?
[10:52:28] <BillCriswell> Yeah, but not forever.
[10:53:01] <BillCriswell> Just when that particular event happens.
[10:53:04] <Evil_Otto> hang on i have a jsfiddle
[10:53:07] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[10:53:13] <Evil_Otto> http://jsfiddle.net/xcATm/
[11:00:26] <Evil_Otto> BillCriswell: anything need explaining?
[11:00:37] <BillCriswell> I got a call.
[11:00:49] <Evil_Otto> ij
[11:00:51] <Evil_Otto> err ok
[11:04:09] <rroelofs> Evil_Otto: I came in late, can you give me a summary?
[11:04:15] <Evil_Otto> rroelofs: sure
[11:04:33] <Evil_Otto> So I have a visible div that gets its contents from the contents of other hidden divs
[11:04:40] <Evil_Otto> one of the hidden divs has a form in it
[11:04:56] <Evil_Otto> whose .submit() event I've attached a function to
[11:05:18] <Evil_Otto> Depending on the reply from an ajax query, the contents of another hidden div replace the contents of the visible div
[11:05:35] <Evil_Otto> now one of the hidden divs has a link in it
[11:06:09] <Evil_Otto> that reloads the contents of the visible div with the contents of the hidden div that has the form in it
[11:06:16] <Evil_Otto> however
[11:06:29] <Evil_Otto> that form appears to not have the function attached to the .submit() event any more
[11:06:40] <Evil_Otto> even if I reassign it explicitly as part of the 'form reset' function
[11:06:44] <Evil_Otto> http://jsfiddle.net/xcATm/
[11:10:40] <sunbeam> what would be a good regexp to check a full name? (eg. if they are words) ?
[11:12:16] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Ummmm... You sure that's something you neeed to do?
[11:12:17] <rroelofs> Evil_Otto: part of your problem may be that the form that is duplicated has the same id as the source form
[11:14:00] <rroelofs> Evil_Otto: also clone() mibht be a better bet for what you are doing
[11:14:03] <Evil_Otto> i was afraid you were going to say something like that
[11:14:14] <Evil_Otto> hmm
[11:14:41] <Evil_Otto> maybe what I could do is just put all the 'hidden' divs inside the visible one and then change the visibility as I need
[11:14:58] <rroelofs> that might be simpler
[11:15:19] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: well at least if it are 2 words
[11:15:22] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: right?
[11:15:23] <rroelofs> otherwise, applying the vent after the html has been moved will work too
[11:16:07] <Evil_Otto> rroelofs: actually, that's what I was trying to do, and it wasn't working
[11:16:13] <Evil_Otto> see the resetForm() function
[11:16:40] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: How about a name like Zack De La Rocha?
[11:17:11] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: 2 or more
[11:17:20] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: See this question... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/888838/regular-expression-for-validating-names-and-surnames
[11:17:31] <sunbeam> ok
[11:18:36] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: You can use name.split(' ') on the name and make sure name[1] isn't empty.
[11:18:54] <rroelofs> Evil_Otto: I did but you have no control over which of the two forms it attaches to
[11:19:46] <Evil_Otto> eh i guess i'll have to mess with the visibility approach
[11:19:49] <rroelofs> unless you change it to $("inline_content").find("form")
[11:19:54] <kbanman> sunbeam: I would be very careful with validating names. There are MANY formats, and people get offended if their name doesn't work with your program
[11:20:04] <Evil_Otto> oh wait that might work
[11:20:08] <sunbeam> yep you're right, thanks guys
[11:20:48] <BillCriswell> Maybe just test name.split(' ')[1].length > 0
[11:20:53] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: No problem.
[11:21:47] <sunbeam> ehm well that would mean that the first word seperated by ' ' is more than 1 char
[11:21:51] <sunbeam> but what if someone inputs
[11:21:55] <sunbeam> Full Name: 1 2
[11:22:06] <sunbeam> dont see any language where that can be a name
[11:22:35] <mnemoc> some countries allow people to change their names to absurd things...
[11:23:21] <mnemoc> I personally know an aussie with 'G' as official surname
[11:23:54] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: /\s[a-z\']/i.test( name ) but yeah... names can be weird.
[11:24:21] <sunbeam> mnemoc: isn't half of the rappers called something like that?
[11:24:27] <sunbeam> G doc
[11:24:33] <sunbeam> :p
[11:24:40] <mnemoc> ^^
[11:24:40] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: ok
[11:24:45] <Evil_Otto> rroelofs: $("#inline_content").find("form") assigns it correctly the first time but not the second :|
[11:25:40] <BillCriswell> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test( 'Bill Criswell' )
[11:25:42] <bot-t> BillCriswell: true
[11:25:49] <BillCriswell> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test( 'Bill' )
[11:25:50] <bot-t> BillCriswell: false
[11:25:52] <BillCriswell> Good times.
[11:26:21] <Evil_Otto> oh ffs
[11:26:23] <rroelofs> Evil_Otto: where is resetForm being called for the 2nd and successive gorounds
[11:26:28] <Evil_Otto> it would help if I did it right
[11:26:30] <Evil_Otto> sec
[11:27:35] <sunbeam> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test('1 2')
[11:27:36] <bot-t> sunbeam: false
[11:27:40] <sunbeam> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test('G 1')
[11:27:41] <bot-t> sunbeam: false
[11:27:43] <sunbeam> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test('G G')
[11:27:44] <bot-t> sunbeam: true
[11:28:03] <Evil_Otto> rroelofs: that did it.
[11:28:11] <rroelofs> great!
[11:28:23] <Evil_Otto> instead of just referring to the id of the form, it finds the one inside the visible div
[11:28:29] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: where's the i for?
[11:28:37] <BillCriswell> case insensitivity
[11:28:41] <sunbeam> ok
[11:33:50] <Sz01> Someone can help me to generate a script that takes the "name" from an anchor and then that name has to be used by an iframe as part of the link????
[11:34:01] <Sz01> http://jsfiddle.net/QFy7D/6/
[11:34:33] <Sz01> the commented code works fine but IE
[11:34:50] <Sz01> but not on IE
[11:36:30] <BillCriswell> Sz01: Do you have access to the HTML?
[11:36:47] <Sz01> http://jsfiddle.net/QFy7D/6/
[11:36:51] <Sz01> there's the link
[11:38:01] <BillCriswell> Sz01: No, I mean... Can you just do <a href="name.html" target="iframe">Hello</a> instead of <a name="name" href="#" target="iframe">Hello</a>.
[11:38:52] <Sz01> i need that for example...if i press on "OPT1" .. the name on <a name="opt1"> , could be used as part of the link of the iframe...like "./(optX).html" >> X is a number
[11:39:21] <Sz01> mmmm ok
[11:39:55] <BillCriswell> I got that, but instead of putting optX in the name attribute just put it in the href.
[11:40:12] <BillCriswell> You won't even need jQuery or any JavaScript for that.
[11:41:06] <Sz01> oh...ok...but the trouble is that i need to make something more general...not depending of an "HREF"... taking the anchor name of the option that I click
[11:42:32] <BillCriswell> Sz01: I'm not really sure what you're shooting for here.
[11:43:22] <Sz01> so its not possible, right?
[11:43:42] <Sz01> take the name of an anchor and use it as part of a link on an iframe? :S
[11:44:40] <parco> hi, do you guys know of a plugin that will transition text in and out, like a slideshow?
[11:44:59] <parco> or better yet, just fade text in and out?
[11:45:48] <hlveheart> Like a news ticker?
[11:45:49] <hlveheart> lol
[11:45:55] <hlveheart> but not ticking, fading?
[11:46:00] <parco> well a news ticker scrolls text from right to left
[11:46:09] <parco> im just looking for a fade in/ fade out
[11:46:19] <IamTrying> I want to use the .dialog() of jQuery ui. But should i add only jQuery 1.7.2 then its throwing error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dialog'
[11:46:28] <aro> is there a way to place the cursor at the beginning of a text field?
[11:46:29] <parco> right, almost like a picture slideshow, but with text
[11:46:59] <parco> i guess i could just .fadeIn(1500).delay(3500).fadeOut(1500) and so on?
[11:47:04] <xomp> hi everyone :] I have a comment system that acts/looks a lot like facebook and I'm trying to find a way to have youtube videos embed properly should someone post a link to a youtube video. I've tried several jquery plugins that supposedly did this but none of them worked. Any ideas on something that does work?
[11:47:17] <BillCriswell> Sz01: $('a').click(function(e){ var $link = $(this); $link.attr('href', $link.attr('name') . '.html'); }); maybe?
[11:47:49] <parco> or maybe i should just go with flash.
[11:48:21] <parco> are fadeIN() delay() and fadeOut() fairly browser compatible?
[11:48:55] <foxyripper> parco: flash is browser incompatible anyway
[11:49:20] <parco> foxyripper, this is true. at least it either works or doesnt though
[11:50:19] <shoky> IamTrying: yes, you need to include jquery ui. duh
[11:50:32] <sunbeam> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test('1 G')
[11:50:33] <bot-t> sunbeam: true
[11:50:33] <foxyripper> parco: fadeIn, delay, etc are browser compatible
[11:50:39] <hlveheart> parco: most modern day news tickers allow you to choose how you want the text to transition
[11:50:44] <BillCriswell> Sz01: http://jsfiddle.net/6j8Qz/
[11:50:50] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: isnt it better to check that it at least starts with a char ?
[11:50:58] <sunbeam> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test('1 2')
[11:50:59] <bot-t> sunbeam: false
[11:51:02] <IamTrying> shoky, added those but still.. <script src="http://jqueryui.com/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js"></script> <script src="http://jqueryui.com/ui/jquery.ui.core.js"></script>
[11:51:02] <sunbeam> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test('G G')
[11:51:03] <bot-t> sunbeam: true
[11:51:08] <sunbeam> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test('2112211212 G')
[11:51:08] <bot-t> sunbeam: true
[11:51:18] <shoky> IamTrying: core.js is not enough
[11:51:23] <parco> gotta love jquery, thanks guys!
[11:52:34] <sunbeam> ?eval /\[a-z\']/i.test('G G')
[11:52:35] <bot-t> sunbeam: false
[11:52:46] <sunbeam> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test('2112211212 G')
[11:52:47] <bot-t> sunbeam: true
[11:52:49] <sunbeam> ?eval /\s[a-z\']/i.test('1 G')
[11:52:50] <bot-t> sunbeam: true
[11:52:58] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Should be doing that in your console haha.
[11:53:04] <BillCriswell> That's for like quick tests.
[11:53:05] <parco> jsfiddle.net? is this like a sandbox?!?!?
[11:53:14] <shoky> IamTrying: you need at least:  ui.core.js, ui.widget.js, ui.position.js, ui.dialog.js    in that order
[11:53:15] <hlveheart> parco, yes
[11:53:18] <parco> Hell yea
[11:53:24] <parco> when did this come out
[11:53:38] <IamTrying> shoky, WOW so many is there, no way to have one only?
[11:53:51] <shoky> IamTrying: of course there is
[11:54:16] <shoky> IamTrying: that's what the custom download builder is for on jqueryui.com
[11:54:47] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: ok sorry
[11:54:48] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: You can do /^[a-z]/i/.test( name ) and /\s[a-z]/i/.test( name ) I guess... but it'll bite you in the ass soon enough I'm sure.
[11:54:48] <IamTrying> shoky, cool, thanks!
[11:55:15] <sunbeam> ?eval /\s[a-z]/i/.test('1 2')
[11:55:16] <bot-t> sunbeam: SyntaxError: syntax error
[11:55:31] <sunbeam> ?eval /^[a-z]/i/.test('1 2');
[11:55:32] <bot-t> sunbeam: SyntaxError: syntax error
[11:55:36] <sunbeam> ok i'll do it in console
[11:56:24] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: /^[a-z]/i.test('Name');  is correct, had an extra / in there.
[11:56:33] <BillCriswell> That tests the start of a string for a letter.
[11:58:48] <Sz01> sorry...i was testing on my code but it doesn't work there... :S http://jsfiddle.net/QFy7D/13/
[12:01:21] <ravenzz> Sz01 remember to select jQuery from the Framework panel
[12:01:46] <sunbeam> ?eval /^[a-z]/i.test('Name');
[12:01:47] <bot-t> sunbeam: true
[12:02:01] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: i exec eval /^[a-z]/i.test('Name'); in console firebug
[12:02:04] <sunbeam> any idea what i do wrong?
[12:02:14] <BillCriswell> You don't need the eval part
[12:02:17] <daemon> Hey all I just setup a mirror for TBP; http://piratebay.interflective.com/ it should be accessible from anywhere in the world and evade any block; ^_^ this may be esspecailly helpful if you happen to be in the UK

[12:03:55] <ravenzz> Sz01 what?
[12:03:57] <ravenzz> :p
[12:04:01] <DerekPioneer> which invalidates the html markup
[12:04:23] <DerekPioneer> how do i get rid of the quotes when using html() or text() ?
[12:04:26] <ravenzz> DerekPioneer what are you trying to do?
[12:04:37] <DerekPioneer> make the contents of a div an h3
[12:04:37] <ravenzz> I don't get it
[12:04:37] <Sz01> ill check it by myself...so thanks a lot for helping me BILL
[12:05:12] <ravenzz> DerekPioneer $(elem).html('<h3>' + albumHeader + '</h3>'))
[12:05:17] <DerekPioneer> na
[12:05:22] <DerekPioneer> that wraps it in quotes
[12:05:26] <DerekPioneer> can't reproduce on jsfiddle
[12:05:35] <parco> whats the most efficient way to load an array of random strings?
[12:05:36] <ravenzz> buh
[12:05:54] <BillCriswell> parco: In JavaScript?
[12:06:13] <parco> BillCriswell, ill be using jquery for the slideshow
[12:06:40] <parco> ill have a mysql table of the strings
[12:07:00] <ravenzz> so they are not random...
[12:07:08] <ravenzz> but somehow real
[12:07:16] <BillCriswell> Yeah... I'm pretty confused dude.
[12:07:18] <parco> well once theyre pulled, ill need to randomize them
[12:07:47] <parco> pretty simple concept guys, i want a slideshow of text, fading in and out, but i want the test order to be different everytime the page is loaded
[12:07:54] <parco> the strings will be coming from a mysql table
[12:07:54] <ravenzz> shuffle them?
[12:08:03] <parco> text order*
[12:08:24] <ravenzz> ah ok so it is only about position?
[12:08:30] <parco> but as far as getting the strings from the mysql to jquery
[12:08:47] <DerekPioneer> meh, maybe i just wasn't saving
[12:08:59] <thinkt4nk> parco insulting people by calling your problem simple is not going to get a lot of mileage.  If it's so simple, fix it yourself
[12:09:19] <parco> thinkt4nk, sorry if you could hear the tone of my voice i wasnt trying to be insulting
[12:09:30] <thinkt4nk> ah, my mistake then
[12:09:33] <thinkt4nk> I apologize
[12:09:54] <parco> no need, my fault for the misunderstanding
[12:09:58] <Sz01> hi I'm back again...I tried but i can't find why it doesn't work on IE or FIREFOX or CHROME or any web browser
[12:10:00] <quizme> if you initiate a click event using jquery, how do you know if window.location.href is going to change?
[12:10:07] <andr0id1> why does this: http://pastebin.com/ucq2upNy gives me a result of lets say if i put 2, gives me result: 20.48 and not 2.48 ?
[12:10:11] <Sz01> but instead, it works on FIDDLE
[12:10:12] <Sz01> :S
[12:10:49] <andr0id1> anyone any ideas?
[12:11:09] <BillCriswell> ?eval 'abcdefghijkl'.split(/\s*/).sort(function(){ return 0.5 - Math.random()});
[12:11:09] <bot-t> BillCriswell: ["c", "f", "d", "a", "e", "h", "b", "g", "j", "i", "k", "l"]
[12:11:25] <BillCriswell> parco: Like that?
[12:11:43] <thinkt4nk> quizme if you're binding the click event of an anchor with an href attribute, you can use e.preventDefault() to prevent the direct, where e is the event argument in your handler
[12:11:46] <IamTrying> showing same error: https://gist.github.com/2713072
[12:12:19] <parco> Bill, youre gonna kill me, thats awesome for if i wanted to randomize the text, what i was trying to explain was that i just want to shuffle the array of strings
[12:12:57] <quizme> thinkt4nk: i don't wnat to prevent the redirect, i just want to do something when the redirect happens
[12:13:00] <BillCriswell> ['one', 'two', 'three'].sort(function( return 0.5 - Math.random()});
[12:13:10] <parco> dude you rock, thank you
[12:13:24] <BillCriswell> I messed up.. shoudl be function(){ *
[12:13:38] <BillCriswell> ?eval ['one', 'two', 'three'].sort(function(){ return 0.5 - Math.random()});
[12:13:38] <sunbeam> ?eval /^[a-z]/i.test('Name');
[12:13:39] <bot-t> BillCriswell: ["two", "one", "three"]
[12:13:39] <bot-t> sunbeam: true
[12:13:40] <New0> what is wrong with this line?
[12:13:41] <New0> $(document).ready(function(){ $('.update').click(function(){ var upd = $(this); upd.load('update.php'); }); });
[12:13:57] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: is there any way to make this regexp so that it needs to be at least 2 words?
[12:14:01] <kevin|WORK> hi all. so i have a click event on a table row, and i am trying to find the cell index that was clicked... so, i have $.inArray(e.srcTarget,e.currentTarget.children) ... it's returning -1, but e.srcTarget === e.currentTarget.children[3] is true... any ideas why?
[12:14:22] <thinkt4nk> quizme that's a new resource, so unless you can send some state in the url or save to the session, then the new resource won't know anything about the previous request.  You have to remember that the web is stateless.
[12:15:18] <quizme> thinkt4nk what about window.onbeforeunload ?
[12:15:24] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: /[a-z\']{2,}/i maybe?
[12:15:27] <thinkt4nk> what about it?
[12:15:27] <andr0id1> why does this: http://pastebin.com/ucq2upNy gives me a result of lets say if i put 2, gives me result: 20.48 and not 2.48 ? and how to use the parseFloat() in my example?
[12:15:38] <BillCriswell> Wait no, wrong.
[12:15:44] <BillCriswell> Wait no, wrong...
[12:17:14] <sunbeam> ?eval /[a-z\']{2,}/i.test('name');
[12:17:16] <bot-t> sunbeam: true
[12:17:25] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: doesnt work i think
[12:18:06] <BillCriswell> Duh... I was just trying to paste the regex... This should work: /([a-z\']\s)+/i.test('Bill Criswell Boop')
[12:18:19] <sunbeam> ?eval /([a-z\']\s)+/i.test('Bill Criswell Boop')
[12:18:21] <bot-t> sunbeam: true
[12:18:24] <sunbeam> ?eval /([a-z\']\s)+/i.test('Bill')
[12:18:25] <bot-t> sunbeam: false
[12:18:27] <sunbeam> ok
[12:18:39] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: any reference on how i can properly learn regex?
[12:18:59] <BillCriswell> I just fuck around with them... a lot. I also try to avoid them at all costs.
[12:19:08] <andr0id1> any help on mi lil prob?
[12:19:38] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: I learned from this: http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-Regular-Expressions-Minutes/dp/0672325667
[12:20:06] <Sz01> don't worry...solving ir
[12:22:31] <sunbeam> thanks
[12:24:10] <danzik17> sunbeam: http://gskinner.com/RegExr/
[12:25:16] <BillCriswell> Ahh, that looks fun.
[12:25:23] <kevin|WORK> nm... typo'd.
[12:26:30] <andr0id1> anyone on my problem?
[12:26:43] <djQuery> just got here
[12:26:47] <thinkt4nk> andr0id1 we can't see the value of that element, so it's anybody's guess
[12:26:49] <djQuery> what was it
[12:27:17] <andr0id1> why does this: http://pastebin.com/ucq2upNy gives me a result of lets say if i put 2, gives me result: 20.48 and not 2.48 ? when i enter lets say 2, i get 20.48
[12:27:24] <BillCriswell> andr0id1: You'd do like... parseFloat($('#pretfaratva').val())
[12:28:14] <BillCriswell> You should really put parseFloat($('#pretfaratva').val()) in a variable
[12:28:14] <Sz01> Thanks everyone!
[12:28:22] <Sz01> Thanks to u BILL
[12:28:23] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[12:28:28] <andr0id1> so: $('#result').text($('#pretfaratva').val() + parseFloat($('#pretfaratva').val())    ?
[12:28:56] <BillCriswell> You should do it on both $('#pretfaratva').val()
[12:29:59] <intrin> hey there
[12:30:16] <andr0id1> it worked :D
[12:30:19] <intrin> can i get some assistance trouble shooting http://jamesbrown4mt.com/picture.html
[12:30:35] <intrin> if u click the first picture, its supposed to open with prettyPicture in a iframe
[12:30:58] <BillCriswell> I was hoping for THE James Brown.
[12:31:04] <intrin> :p
[12:31:29] <BillCriswell> You mean in like a lightbox? If not, where's this iframe?
[12:31:48] <BillCriswell> intrin: Also... you didn't include jQuery.
[12:32:10] <intrin> hmmm
[12:32:17] <intrin> yes lightbox
[12:32:21] <BillCriswell> Well, the error log says "jQuery is not defined"
[12:32:21] <intrin> lemme see quick
[12:32:35] <intrin> <script type="text/javascript" src="script/jquery-1.5.1.min.js"></script>
[12:32:38] <BillCriswell> intrin: Oh duh, put prettyPhoto.js after jquery.
[12:32:52] <intrin> it is
[12:32:53] <intrin> <script type="text/javascript" src="script/jquery-1.4.3.min.js"></script>
[12:32:54] <intrin> <script type="text/javascript" src="script/jquery-1.5.1.min.js"></script>
[12:32:54] <intrin> <script type="text/javascript" src="script/jquery.prettyPhoto.js"></script>
[12:33:03] <BillCriswell> Not seeing that order here.
[12:33:16] <intrin> hmm
[12:33:20] <BillCriswell> I'm getting jquery.prettyPhoto.js first
[12:33:34] <LordThumper> Why two jQuery loads?
[12:33:41] <BillCriswell> Yes, that too. No good.
[12:34:05] <andr0id1> ok, so i resolved it, hot to make to see only 2 numbers after the . ?
[12:34:12] <intrin> refresh
[12:34:31] <thinkt4nk> if one jQuery is good, two has gotta' be really good, yeah? XD
[12:34:40] <thinkt4nk> s/has/have/
[12:34:47] <intrin> lol
[12:34:48] <intrin> :P
[12:34:59] <BillCriswell> intrin: It's still saying jQuery is not defined.
[12:35:12] <intrin> i clearly see it in the source tho
[12:35:39] <New0> after .load('file.php'); how to append to elem.(file.php)?
[12:36:51] <andr0id1> ok, so how to see only 2 numbers after the . ?
[12:37:01] <andr0id1> after parseFloat ?
[12:37:47] <yeap> yo guys .... i have created a chat with php but i have to click every time refresh to see what other members write .. i found someting about  long polling .. watched some vids but i can,t really understand it... please can anyone help me with easy step links or idk .. :(
[12:37:49] <BillCriswell> intrin: I'm not sure what the issue is. I'm just going by what the console is telling me.
[12:38:02] <BillCriswell> What happens if you get rid of the 1.4.3 jquery?
[12:38:48] <raj> I have an array of objects, and I want to select the object with a particular value for a particular key
[12:38:53] <raj> what would be the best way to do this?
[12:39:00] <raj> i don't think .filter() is appropriate
[12:40:34] <intrin> same thing
[12:40:39] <intrin> i reproduced this
[12:40:39] <intrin> http://jamesbrown4mt.com/test.html
[12:40:45] <shoky> oi
[12:40:47] <intrin> its partially working there
[12:41:10] <shoky> raj: $.grep ?
[12:41:13] <BillCriswell> intrin: I'm not getting the jquery error there.
[12:41:16] <intrin> does not open in light box
[12:41:21] <intrin> but it opens the larger size
[12:41:28] <intrin> and all the icons assosatied with light box
[12:41:33] <intrin> but no light box fame
[12:41:43] <intrin> chrome, testing in ie now
[12:41:54] <intrin> same
[12:42:04] <raj> shoky, thank you, I think so :)
[12:42:21] <shoky> ;]
[12:42:22] <raj> i'm addicted to $.each
[12:42:26] <raj> gotta get off that train
[12:42:38] <shoky> you need to be addicted to the whole idea
[12:42:39] <BillCriswell> raj: I'm hooked on .map!
[12:42:46] <shoky> which includes $.each $.map $.grep
[12:42:59] <shoky> and their jqcollection counterparts .each .map .filter
[12:44:35] <raj> yeah, i just gotta force myself to use $.grep more and i know i can learn to love it
[12:44:37] <intrin> BillCriswell, any idea why its opening on the same page now, but not in a lightbox frame?
[12:45:03] <BillCriswell> intrin: I'd assume you are missing a stylesheet or something.
[12:45:28] <yeap> hmmm?
[12:45:29] <intrin> ah!
[12:45:33] * intrin checks
[12:45:35] <intrin> ty
[12:45:39] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[12:48:13] <intrin> sweet
[12:48:14] <intrin> got it
[12:48:16] <intrin> well
[12:48:23] <intrin> still issues, but closer to the goal
[12:48:39] <BillCriswell> Baby steps!
[12:50:06] <yeap> Guys what do this script ? http://pastebin.com/R2CBeHe6
[12:50:13] <mystiiq> if I do an ajax request, then jquery adds this http://url?_=TIMESTAMP, how to remove this timestamp?
[12:51:32] <mystiiq> aah, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/, cache option
[12:55:03] <yeap> guys i want to use this long polling can anyone help me ? http://pastebin.com/R2CBeHe6
[12:55:04] <yeap> !
[12:55:31] <gho5t> is there a concise way to call multiple methods on a widget?
[12:56:18] <gho5t> $('#mywidget').myWidget('add', 'calculate') ?
[12:58:53] <Foxhoundz> jQuery, is there any method to animate the background color of an element from a specific color into a transparent or "none"?
[12:59:26] <Foxhoundz> I found a color animation jQuery plugin, but it does not animate the process of setting the background property to none
[12:59:58] <BillCriswell> Foxhoundz: Can you just animate the opacity of the item?
[13:00:30] <ravenzz> Foxhoundz do you care about IE<10 ?
[13:00:50] <Foxhoundz> ravenzz: I'm supporting IE8+
[13:01:03] <Foxhoundz> BillCriswell: Other nested elements will be affected by the opacity change
[13:01:29] <ravenzz> you can use css3 transitions
[13:01:33] <BillCriswell> rgba would be sweet.
[13:01:56] <Foxhoundz> Here's the site: http://dagmatic.info/testground/
[13:02:05] <ravenzz> BillCriswell there wouln'd be different between rgb hex rbha or whatever i guess
[13:02:11] <ravenzz> rgba*
[13:02:27] <BillCriswell> I don't think IE supports RGBA
[13:02:33] <yeap> can anyone help me with the long polling ?
[13:02:49] <LSshock> i have a div filled with some buttons (divs), you can drag them into a sortable column and when i want to be able to do is to change the div that has been dropped so that it turns into a widget (so just change its css and content) i'm using CLONE
[13:03:15] <BillCriswell> Foxhoundz: Seems to work in IE9+
[13:03:20] <BillCriswell> No 8 support.
[13:03:39] <BillCriswell> Oh wait IE9 doesn't support css animations.. nevermind.
[13:03:49] <ravenzz> BillCriswell the thing is that you cannot animate() the background background-color css property
[13:04:25] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: You can't animate it to transparent, there's plugins that let you animate it from one color to another though.
[13:05:23] <Foxhoundz> hmm
[13:05:25] <ravenzz> dunno I wouldn't care of IE8/9
[13:05:33] <ravenzz> seems to be a personal website
[13:05:48] <Foxhoundz> ravenzz: this site will double as my portfolio page
[13:05:52] <BillCriswell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3679864/jquery-animate-to-transparent second answer here seem helpful.
[13:05:54] <Foxhoundz> as well as a content management system template
[13:06:17] <LSshock> so the widget is a .draggable, and i want to be able to change/target the cloned version that drops into the .sortable right after its been dropped
[13:06:32] <ravenzz> eh Foxhoundz I'd consider to change the bg..is too heavy, you could make it more opaque
[13:06:51] <someprimetime> yeap: what do you want to kow about it?
[13:06:52] <someprimetime> know, rather
[13:06:53] <ravenzz> Foxhoundz are you a graphic designer?
[13:07:04] <Foxhoundz> ravenzz: No I am not
[13:07:17] <Foxhoundz> I'm more of a PHP developer than anything else
[13:08:01] <Foxhoundz> But I have projects ranging from .NET apps to photoshop stuff, so I was thinking of making a colorful site to showcase it all
[13:08:09] <ravenzz> ok then. As developer I'd rather prefer to see how it degrade than how you polyfill the bg animation
[13:08:19] <ravenzz> but this is only my opinion
[13:08:55] <yeap> someprimetime yo god thanks :) , hello i have found this on the net http://pastebin.com/dqaL9Bwq       i have a chat in php and im using foreach loop to get all the messages. .. all works fine but i need a long polling so users can see and no need to refresh page every time .. my question is how i can implement this code with my foreach loop .. idk i have never worked with jquery can you help me a little please ? :/
[13:11:34] <intrin> yay
[13:11:35] <intrin> i got it
[13:11:39] <intrin> thanks again BillCriswell
[13:12:44] <someprimetime> yeap: you're going to need to set an interval/timeout and then within that, you're going to basically have your ajax() call which returns something in the data callback object so if you json_encode within php a variable called success with a value of 'true' in your ajax callback you'd just go if(data.success === 'true') { // print out new chat messages or append them to a container }
[13:13:55] <ravenzz> why don't return true instead of 'true' :p
[13:14:12] <someprimetime> it doesn't matter
[13:14:34] <someprimetime> but if you are json_encoding true as a string, i'd check for the truthiness of a string value
[13:14:36] <thinkt4nk> it should if you're using the identity comparison operator
[13:15:19] <yeap> someprimetime okey this helped me thanks alot but i still can,t get in my head how to start :/ i dont want to be nerfy but can,t you come in my pc with teamviewer can show me how to start  ? :/
[13:15:31] <someprimetime> LOL
[13:15:34] <someprimetime> nah dude sorry
[13:15:36] <ravenzz> :D
[13:15:38] <someprimetime> i'm at work #1
[13:15:44] <someprimetime> #2 i don't teamview for people
[13:15:52] <someprimetime> but i'll give you some resources
[13:16:16] <someprimetime> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval

[13:16:36] <someprimetime> http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[13:16:41] <someprimetime> you need those 3 things
[13:19:08] <yeap> someprimetime okey so this code i posted you i wont use it cuz i found it here http://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery
[13:19:23] <thinkt4nk> he left, dude
[13:20:04] <yeap> :D:D
[13:20:11] <yeap> :(
[13:22:02] <yeap> lol i can,t get in guys ...

[13:23:12] <yeap> anyone from slovakia , germany here ?
[13:23:38] <aFeijo> hi folks, how can I send the END key? to position the cursor at the end of the current input field
[13:24:54] <Eviltwin> ?g stack overflow javascript jump to end of input @ aFeijo
[13:24:55] <caniuse> aFeijo: Set mouse focus and move cursor to end of input ... - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1056359/set-mouse-focus-and-move-cursor-to-end-of-input-using-jquery
[13:24:56] <bartmax> hey, what's the best to do ajax file uploads ? using ajaxForms? what pro suggests/use?
[13:25:00] <NoiseEee> yeap: nobody is going to write code for you.
[13:25:22] <NoiseEee> yeap: try to work on the bits and pieces at a time, post your bits when they don't work and folsk will help you improve it
[13:25:36] <aFeijo> Eviltwin, thanks, I've been googling after that in the past hour :p didn't try the stack overflow tho
[13:25:37] <NoiseEee> yeap: but your comments suggest you expect a personal tutorial or lesson, and thats not going to happen
[13:25:41] <Eviltwin> bartmax: One technique involves using AJAX on the browers that support it
[13:26:06] <Eviltwin> bartmax: The most widely-available method involves using an <iframe>
[13:26:32] <Eviltwin> You have the form submit to the frame instead of to the current window
[13:26:50] <yeap> NoiseEee hey, i know you from php ;) the world is small :D ofc im trying to write it but is hard.
[13:26:51] <bartmax> Eviltwin: i know and i know how to implement them. my question is, when you go to do a file upload, do u use a library ? which one? build everything from scratch ?
[13:28:34] <Eviltwin> bartmax: I've seen a lot of people use this: http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[13:28:39] <Eviltwin> Most have been pretty happy with it
[13:29:22] <bartmax> nice. thank you Eviltwin
[13:29:28] <bartmax> looks great
[13:31:51] <NoReGreT> given this json, http://pastie.org/3922289 how can I get TagList
[13:32:42] <Eviltwin> If it's parsed into "object"
[13:32:58] <Eviltwin> Then object.data.TagList
[13:33:50] <NoReGreT> Eviltwin: that's right, there is data.0 and data.TagList, i'm trying to $.each(data.0) but JS is messing up
[13:34:02] <NoReGreT> is data.0 correct ?
[13:34:05] <Eviltwin> No
[13:34:10] <Eviltwin> data[0] or data["0"]
[13:34:14] <NoReGreT> aha
[13:34:41] <bartmax> Eviltwin: interested on rellocating to work to Uruguay ? :D
[13:34:47] <Eviltwin> Nope
[13:36:46] <ravenzz> Eviltwin I have used it recently ... and the final thought is that there should be something better! :p
[13:36:59] <Eviltwin> ravenzz: Then make something better :P
[13:37:03] <xiam> i've been playing with a plugin http://xiam.menteslibres.org/p/jquery-screen/ , not that the plugin site is gone, what's the best place to publish it?
[13:37:19] <smplstk> NoReGreT: http://jsfiddle.net/WhPPr/
[13:37:19] <Eviltwin> xiam: Ask Google really nicely to show it
[13:37:20] <xiam> *now that the plugins site is gone
[13:38:05] <ravenzz> Eviltwin ahah let's do it :p
[13:45:26] <yeap> http://blog.perplexedlabs.com/2009/05/04/php-jquery-ajax-javascript-long-polling/         there is missing some code no ?  Undefined variable: datasource
[13:50:52] <New0> can i pass $_get var with $.load()?
[13:51:21] <thinkt4nk> add it to your url?
[13:51:34] <New0> after the url like: elem.load('file.php', get=...)?
[13:51:51] <New0> not sure how. but if possible at all
[13:52:12] <thinkt4nk> no, like elem.load('file.php?somevar=this');
[13:52:14] <New0> to use $.load() to pass a get
[13:52:53] <New0> thinkt4nk, yep :) didn't thiink about this one, i will try it and let u know
[13:53:10] <thinkt4nk> ah, actually, the second argument is the data for the request
[13:53:15] <thinkt4nk> should just be a dictionary
[13:53:29] <thinkt4nk> if the request type is get, then it should pass the params in the get verb
[13:55:14] <New0> thinkt4nk, and well :) it's working great :) (need to setup my code of course. anyway what about the data?
[13:55:27] <yeap> what make this ?
[13:55:29] <yeap> $("#mydiv").html(data);
[13:55:32] <thinkt4nk> awesome
[13:55:35] <New0> thinkt4nk, also if u can specify my nickname so i will konw
[13:55:39] <rhino_> I am trying to do this to set a default val for an input, so that if they have already entered a value for the input and its in the db, it shows up, otherwise, they get the text.  The db value shows up, but the default text doesn't.  Here is the code:  onfocus=\"if ($.trim($(this).val()))  == ''){'Enter Answer Here.'}else{$answer}\"
[13:56:05] <thinkt4nk> New0 data is the second argument, see the doc in jQuery's api
[13:56:28] <rhino_> Brodingo_: any ideas? ^^
[13:56:30] <New0> thinkt4nk, well saw that, but dunno how to use it
[13:56:42] <thinkt4nk> New0 should just be a dictionary of key/value pairs
[13:57:18] <New0> thinkt4nk, so if it's and get then? $.load('file.php', data??? );
[13:57:51] <thinkt4nk> New0 would be like myElem.load('file.php', { someVar: 'meh' });
[13:58:14] <New0> thinkt4nk, $.load('file.php', get['id', 2]?
[13:58:16] <thinkt4nk> New0 I say dictionary, but it's an object literal :P
[13:58:34] <thinkt4nk> New0 myElem.load('file.php', {id: 2});
[13:59:18] <Brodingo_> rhino_ you should probably avoid inline handlers and let on() take care of delegation
[14:00:09] <yeap> guys i found on the net this -- > http://pastebin.com/NWyHGA0A what will it do ?
[14:00:46] <Brodingo_> rhino_ aside from that youre not really doing anything in that if else
[14:01:22] <New0> thinkt4nk, ok $.load('file.php', {  '$_get[]' : ['id', value] } ) ; like this i setting the var get ?
[14:02:02] <rhino_> Brodingo_:  how so, I thought the if portion would set the value to Enter Answer here.
[14:02:11] <rhino_> no?
[14:03:46] <New0> thinkt4nk, what i dont understand. is how can i declair a get with jQuery or js?
[14:04:45] <thinkt4nk> New0 I was wrong.  If data is provided as an argument, it assumes the request method is POST
[14:05:13] <Brodingo_> rhino_ you have to use = to set something no? or use a function?
[14:05:16] <thinkt4nk> you'll either have to use $.get or serialize the parameters in the URL
[14:06:46] <New0> thinkt4nk, Thank You i didn't notice this POST at the jQuery.com/load if u can tell me which line? and yes i did serialize  at the URL
[14:08:30] <thinkt4nk> see where it says "Request Method"
[14:08:48] <New0> thinkt4nk, ok Thank You very much :) got to sleep tommorow is schools. GoodBye
[14:08:57] <thinkt4nk> np, take care
[14:10:37] <NoiseEee> i don't suppose there's a method that can be called on a form element to 'reset it' to its original value?
[14:10:40] <NoiseEee> (at page load)
[14:12:16] <thinkt4nk> NoiseEee there's an HTML5 attribute for placeholder, if that's what you're asking
[14:18:52] <qom2> http://jsfiddle.net/eF6Lp/  how come this is not working?
[14:20:29] <toddWork> i remember seeing a pattern where you bind click to $('body') and then listen for events on $(event).find('myClass'); anyone know of an example/docs for this?
[14:20:51] <toddWork> (that's assuming i remember it correctly)
[14:21:17] <NoiseEee> qom2: selectedIndex is a property of the dom element proper, not the jquery object
[14:21:25] <thinkt4nk> toddWork are you, perhaps, thinking of delegate or on?
[14:21:38] <NoiseEee> qom2: http://jsfiddle.net/eF6Lp/1/
[14:21:56] <toddWork> thinkt4nk: it was more like a pattern of setting up your javascript.
[14:22:04] <qom2> NoiseEee: yay, thanks :)
[14:22:10] <toddWork> not a particular method.
[14:22:59] <thinkt4nk> toddWork not really sure what you're trying to accomplish, sorry
[14:23:09] <toddWork> thinkt4nk: ok, my memory is hazy; thank you.
[14:23:18] <thinkt4nk> np :)
[14:23:25] <amaroks> hello, I have var x = 5 and var y = 6 , I want to transform the y into a 6% instead of 6, how do I do that?
[14:24:01] <NoiseEee> amaroks: y = y+'%';
[14:24:56] <qom2> NoiseEee: interesting, when I implented it to my project I got this: jQuery("select[name='parent_id']")[0] is undefined
[14:24:59] <qom2> not sure why
[14:25:55] <NoiseEee> perhaps that element does not exist / is not what you think
[14:26:16] <qom2> yeah. doh, I included in the head, should've been the footer
[14:26:17] <qom2> thanks
[14:27:03] <someprimetime> toddWork: you mean $('#foobar').click(function(e) { // e.target }); ?
[14:27:13] <amaroks> NoiseEee: it wont work, it will break the function
[14:27:34] <NoiseEee> amaroks: ?
[14:28:34] <amaroks> NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/qHe4vQxc , see line 14 , I really appreciate your help
[14:28:38] <smplstk> NoiseEee: I think he intends to factor it
[14:28:41] <smplstk> as a percentage
[14:28:50] <smplstk> like 5 * 1.06
[14:28:52] <toddWork> someprimetime: no. i'm looking for like a plugin pattern where all clicks are heard on $('body') and then if else'd to filter them to their respective functions.
[14:28:56] <toddWork> i'm still googleing.
[14:29:00] <smplstk> what's a math?
[14:29:01] <toddWork> thanks, though.
[14:29:53] <toddWork> cowboy has some of it here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff696759.aspx but i'm looking for even more hand-holding.
[14:29:55] <someprimetime> hmm not sure if i follow if you structure all your html code to be included within <body></body>, then naturally, all clicks are heard on body
[14:30:33] <someprimetime> you're writing a jquery plugin?
[14:30:46] <toddWork> yeah, i guess i am.
[14:30:49] <someprimetime> best thing is to namespace into a closure like it looks like he's mentioning
[14:31:01] <Emn1ty> How do you loop through all elements in a xml dom object?
[14:31:02] <someprimetime> i'd just go off of the jquery plugin example
[14:31:06] <someprimetime> ? plugin @ toddWork
[14:31:06] <bot-t> toddWork, (function($){ $.pluginName = function() { /* code */ }; $.fn.pluginName = function() { return this.each(function(){ /* code */ }); }; })(jQuery);
[14:31:08] <someprimetime> err
[14:31:15] <toddWork> i'll check it out. thanks.
[14:31:16] <someprimetime> ? plugin pattern @toddWork
[14:31:17] <bot-t> toddWork, Plugins/Authoring - jQuery offers a mechanism for adding in methods and functionality, bundled as plugins. Most of the methods and functions included in the default download are written using the jQuery plugin construct. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[14:31:22] <someprimetime> that one is what i use
[14:31:45] <someprimetime> that's the best way to do it with Array.prototype.slice.call()
[14:42:03] <Mowee_> Hey guys, How can I detect where exactly the user has clicked? There are three parts, the input field, the text and the icon. Is there any way? http://jsfiddle.net/Yx4Bq/
[14:42:18] <Gsingh> how do I look for a string class that is does not a have a fixed name but rather is found by a regex for example: $(.someClass[regex])...
[14:43:35] <pifantastic> Gsingh: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[14:43:57] <ngharo> Mowee_: you can check e.target
[14:44:19] <ngharo> $('h2').click(function(e) { console.log(e.target); });

[14:47:23] <huglester> guys, I have a jquery class... which should load 1 image per second.... code is here: http://d.pr/i/EO1i . the problem is that setInterval() works only once... after this I see all 7 logs at 1 time in the loggs
[14:48:03] <ngharo> i see setTimeout not setInterval
[14:48:26] <amaroks> myvar +'%'     returns NaN , please someone helps
[14:48:35] <amaroks> say my var has the val of 10
[14:49:38] <ngharo> ?js var myvar = 10; myvar + '%';
[14:49:43] <bot-t> ngharo: "10%"
[14:49:58] <Mowee_> pifantastic: Thank you :)
[14:51:59] <huglester> ngharo: hm... probably got lost while chaning all those stuff. let me play a bit more:))))
[14:52:48] <pifantastic> ?toString @ amaroks
[14:52:51] <bot-t> amaroks, #11463 (Use instanceof instead of toString)  jQuery Core - Bug ... - Opened 2 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11463
[14:52:53] <amaroks> ngharo: I have made it myvar = 10% ;   50 - myvar =
[14:52:54] <pifantastic> damn
[14:52:55] <pifantastic> ignore that
[14:53:00] <amaroks> its returning NaN
[14:53:18] <pifantastic> amaroks: that's because myvar is a number, so it's casting the '%' to a number
[14:53:38] <pifantastic> ?eval myvar = 10; myvar.toString() + '%'
[14:53:39] <bot-t> pifantastic: "10%"
[14:54:38] <ngharo> amaroks: you're subtracting a string from a number in what you just said above
[14:54:53] <ngharo> ?js 50 - '10%'
[14:54:54] <bot-t> ngharo: NaN
[14:55:09] <ngharo> ?js 50 - parseInt('10%', 10)
[14:55:09] <bot-t> ngharo: 40
[14:55:54] <huglester> ngharo: I changed code a bit. I set time here now: http://d.pr/i/FoMt . But in console log, I see the delay only between 'packs'. first and second image have almost the same time.. the second pack has 1second delay (1000ms) like here: http://d.pr/i/Dv4A
[14:56:19] <amaroks> 50 - myvar.toString() = NaN   ngharo
[14:56:26] <amaroks> myvar is 20%
[14:56:42] <ngharo> yes, you cant subtract a string from a number.  that makes no sense
[14:56:53] <ngharo> parseInt() will convert a string to a number
[14:57:21] <ngharo> and don't use .toString(), you don't have to
[14:57:39] <amaroks> how do I use  parseInt ?
[14:57:53] <ngharo> ?js 50 - parseInt('10%', 10) @ amaroks
[14:57:54] <bot-t> amaroks: 40
[14:58:00] <amaroks> my var is dynmic and can be 20% m 50%
[14:58:03] <someprimetime> amaroks: var num = '3'; var int = parseInt(num, 10);
[14:58:05] <amaroks> got it but whats the 10?
[14:58:08] <someprimetime> base
[14:58:15] <someprimetime> it's not necessary
[14:58:19] <someprimetime> but it's useful to include.
[14:58:27] <someprimetime> by default js assumes it's base 10
[14:58:32] <someprimetime> but you can replace it for other bases as well
[14:59:03] <NoReGreT> is there any syntax error here, http://pastie.org/3922700 the page is not laoding JS
[14:59:18] <ngharo> huglester: packs?
[14:59:22] <someprimetime> NoReGreT: check your console log
[14:59:45] <huglester> ngharo: pack = array of images (in last examples two iamges, index 0 and index 1)
[14:59:45] <amaroks> pastInt
[14:59:50] <amaroks> did it , thanls

[15:00:42] <Xtrivity> Hey guys, i'm creating a slider. Is there a way to change the URL from http://test.com/index.php to http://test.com/anotherpage.php or even http://test.com/index.php?=anotherpage
[15:00:45] <ngharo> huglester: yeah i dunno, i'd need to see a demo to be helpful
[15:01:16] <huglester> ngharo: I will try to set up jsfiddle, is it a good place for an example?
[15:01:22] <ngharo> yep
[15:01:38] <huglester> nice, give me some time, will be doind it for the first time :))))
[15:01:48] <someprimetime> well if you checked your console log it might show you why maybe?
[15:01:56] <sanjayb> Xtrivity: you mean, without reloading the page ? if you just want to change the URL - window.location = "foo.php";
[15:03:01] <oojacoboo> what's the easiest way to capture the return event?  Should I just use a keycode checker function on keyUp?
[15:03:16] <oojacoboo> return being, hitting the return key
[15:03:27] <oojacoboo> I know it's not technically an "event"
[15:03:33] <shoky> yea, keypress or keyup event
[15:03:37] <Xtrivity> sanjayb ill give it a shot, thanks
[15:03:44] <sanjayb> oojacoboo: you have to check keyCode on .keyup or so, yes
[15:03:56] <oojacoboo> that's going to require decoding that key right?
[15:04:05] <shoky> 13 is return
[15:04:09] <oojacoboo> yea thanks
[15:04:22] <Xtrivity> sanjayb that redirects the page, im referring to without reloading the page
[15:04:27] <sanjayb> oojacoboo: what's the use-case? if its an input element or so, it'll trigger submit of the form its in, and you can catch that ..
[15:04:38] <sanjayb> Xtrivity: that, my friend, is a much more interesting problem :)
[15:05:01] <Xtrivity> sanjayb is it possible?
[15:05:08] <sanjayb> Xtrivity: yes
[15:05:40] <sanjayb> Xtrivity: well, so, its possible, quite easy to update it to something with a # so like the page you're on is foo.php and you update it to foo.php#image1
[15:06:04] <sanjayb> Xtrivity: where its interesting is when you are on foo.php and you want to update url to bar.php (without a page reload)
[15:07:11] <sanjayb> Xtrivity: I've used this - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[15:07:39] <sanjayb> Xtrivity: the problem being that new browsers support history.pushState which allow you to do this, just that then you need some sort of fallback for older browsers ..
[15:09:58] <sanjayb> Xtrivity: again - not sure exactly what your use-case is ..
[15:10:16] <oojacoboo> sanjayb, yea, for a textarea to submit
[15:10:29] <huglester> ngharo: I modified js a bit, so it would log to html, not console..since not sure how to see console logs in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/F9r2k/
[15:10:47] <oojacoboo> no need to block the default event b/c it's the only element in the form
[15:11:06] <sanjayb> oojacoboo: ah, in a textarea then you need to bind to keyup or so with something like $('textarea').bind("keyup", function(e) { if (e.keyCode == 13) { doSomething;}); ..
[15:11:19] <oojacoboo> why bind?
[15:11:32] <sanjayb> oojacoboo: ah - or just $('textarea').keyup ...
[15:11:36] <oojacoboo> :)
[15:11:48] <sanjayb> oojacoboo: but, yea .. dont see how else
[15:11:49] <oojacoboo> I don't like to over bind ;)
[15:12:27] <sanjayb> oojacoboo: why? :)
[15:12:55] <oojacoboo> I just don't see the need to bind that event to the object if it's not needed
[15:14:01] <shoky> we are the overbinders
[15:14:15] <shoky> take us to your handler
[15:14:50] <oojacoboo> lol
[15:15:36] <shoky> did you mean that calling .bind('keyup'...  is overbinding?  as  opposed to .keyup(... ?
[15:15:50] <oojacoboo> it's binding, no?
[15:16:01] <shoky> they're both binding
[15:16:09] <shoky> it's exactly the same
[15:16:15] <BinaryKitten> except that .keyup now calls .on
[15:16:21] <oojacoboo> does it?
[15:16:26] <shoky> yes, as does .bind
[15:16:28] <oojacoboo> mmm
[15:16:29] <BinaryKitten> :D
[15:16:40] <oojacoboo> I didn't know bind called on, and I thought bind was deprecated
[15:16:49] <shoky> it is
[15:16:52] <oojacoboo> I guess they all call on now
[15:17:01] <shoky> ah its not actually
[15:19:59] <oojacoboo> would I just want to trigger("submit") on my form on the keyUp ?
[15:20:05] <oojacoboo> I'm assuming so
[15:20:17] <shoky> you can .submit() on the form
[15:20:33] <oojacoboo> I thought that was for capturing the submit event?
[15:20:43] <shoky> with no arguments its for triggering
[15:20:53] <oojacoboo> but I need a function()
[15:21:02] <shoky> a function to do what
[15:21:08] <oojacoboo> submit the thing :P
[15:21:17] <shoky> huh.
[15:21:21] <oojacoboo> validation, DOM updates, ajax calls
[15:21:28] <shoky> then call your function...
[15:21:59] <shoky> are you sure you mean to submit a form?
[15:22:04] <oojacoboo> yes
[15:22:12] <shoky> ajax is not submitting a form
[15:22:41] <oojacoboo> not following
[15:22:45] <shoky> me neither
[15:22:49] <oojacoboo> :)
[15:23:11] <oojacoboo> when submitting the form, I'm making an ajax call to save the thing
[15:23:19] <oojacoboo> then getting my return and updating the DOM
[15:23:19] <shoky> save the thing, right.
[15:23:23] <oojacoboo> right
[15:23:28] * shoky sighs
[15:24:53] <oojacoboo> shoky, I'm still not seeing how to use submit() to trigger that event
[15:25:03] <oojacoboo> the API suggests that it's for capturing the event
[15:25:25] <shoky> $('#myForm').submit()
[15:25:27] <shoky> submits the form
[15:25:53] <oojacoboo> then how do you modify the event for that?
[15:26:55] <shoky> you dont. you either submit the form or you dont
[15:27:15] <oojacoboo> yea, but I want to preventDefault(); for one
[15:27:23] <oojacoboo> would I just use another function for that?
[15:27:26] <shoky> like i said, i dont think you actually mean to submit the form. you mean to somehow send its contents via ajax
[15:27:32] <oojacoboo> listening on that event
[15:27:48] <luls> ^CcGgHhJjSsWwYy^^??????????????????????????????????????????????????^??
[15:27:52] <oojacoboo> yes, I mean to send it's contents, but I want to preventDefault for one
[15:27:56] <shoky> luls is making more sense than you, oojacoboo
[15:28:04] <Emn1ty> oojacoboo: what do you want to do when you submit the form?
[15:28:09] <oojacoboo> shoky, nevermind, I got it
[15:28:22] <oojacoboo> Emn1ty, no worries
[15:28:48] <shoky> great

[15:33:47] <Snwspeckle> Hey is there any snippets I can easily use to refresh a variable like every 5 seconds?
[15:33:52] <Snwspeckle> Its to show player status
[15:34:00] <shoky> refresh a variable?
[15:34:31] <Snwspeckle> Like to refresh the variable that displays users online
[15:34:46] <Snwspeckle> So you dont have to manually refresh the page for it to pull new data?
[15:34:57] <shoky> first learn what variables are
[15:35:06] <shoky> as opposed to DOM elements
[15:35:14] <Less_Seen> knockoutjs is pretty cool for observables
[15:35:24] <shoky> knockoutjs is awesome
[15:35:31] <shoky> but it is the last thing i recommend for Snwspeckle
[15:35:42] <Less_Seen> kk "._.
[15:35:44] <shoky> who doesn't know the difference between variables and DOM elements
[15:35:50] <Snwspeckle> ...
[15:36:00] <tw2113> there's a diff?!?!?
[15:36:15] <Snwspeckle> I know what they are
[15:36:17] <shoky> sry i thought i was whispering
[15:36:29] * tw2113 goes to rethink life
[15:37:21] <shoky> anyway after you've mastered that, check out ajax and setTimeout()
[15:37:31] <shoky> THEN, maybe checkout knockoutjs ;)
[15:41:17] <dsds> hello , i have found a code that will refresh my div every x secounds .. but it refresh very fast i tryed to edit the int values but it nothing changed. .. wtf? http://pastebin.com/aAQAFgyR
[15:42:17] <amaroks> is it allowed to look for commercial help from someone on here?
[15:42:47] <shoky> dsds: are you intentionally doing .html(data)  followed by .html('')   ??
[15:43:06] <dsds> shoky idk i found it on the net.
[15:43:24] <shoky> dsds: ok try removing the .html('') line..
[15:43:36] <shoky> cause that like.. empties that div
[15:43:45] <shoky> from the content you just put in it
[15:45:47] * sanjayb scrolls up .. .bind() is deprecated!! waah.. i feel old :(
[15:45:53] <shoky> its not ;\
[15:45:58] <sanjayb> oh
[15:45:59] <sanjayb> whew
[15:46:01] <shoky> ;D
[15:46:30] <dsds> shoky okey i can,t make it that it will refresh without knowing .. its blinking hard ... you know
[15:46:39] <imsky> wwwwwww
[15:46:43] <shoky> dsds you smell trollish
[15:47:18] <shoky> i'll go grab some ice cream as defense
[15:48:28] <dsds> shoky but the times dont work ...
[15:48:42] <dsds> shoky i setted the times to 100000000000 but it still refresh every sec lol .
[15:48:48] <sanjayb> holy geezz .. pastebin.com is blocked .. Indian ISPs have suddenly gone mad. argh.
[15:50:07] <LuisSantos> Do you guys have any good example or suggestion how can I put the data I have in my session variable on a document? and also map it into that document so I could put it in the right spot of a PDF file for example?
[15:50:21] <imsky> what
[15:50:53] <dsds> come on why my times dont working ? http://pastebin.com/K4bQeua5
[15:51:03] <dsds> it refresh every secound like crazy .
[16:03:55] <majuscule> I am trying to add a function to $(document).ready(), but if I call it $(document).ready() more than once it ceases to work
[16:04:05] <majuscule> How can I append a function?
[16:05:09] <majuscule> :-/ oo docs say it should, something else must be amiss
[16:06:14] <Brodingo> majuscule make all your doc ready function calls inside an anonymous function
[16:06:30] <shoky> you dont append to a function (normally). each time you call $(document).ready() you're assigning a new handler callback for the DOM ready event
[16:08:13] <dsds> can,t i do someting like this ? $('#ref').load(data);
[16:08:41] <dsds> ?
[16:11:45] <Brodingo> dsds are you trying to insert html?
[16:12:55] <dsds> Brodingo im trying to refresh just a part of my index.php so i dont want the $('#ref').load(index.php); just like $('#ref') the div i want load.
[16:15:17] <Brodingo> dsds you can specify a selector when using load $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container');
[16:16:07] <dsds> Brodingo okey but why we keep the #result there.. ?
[16:16:52] <Brodingo> ?load url @ dsds
[16:16:53] <bot-t> dsds, .load(url, data, [complete]): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[16:16:57] <Brodingo> read up
[16:19:37] <dsds> Brondigo this suxs. . its dosn,t work good you know i have a chat and i want to refresh it every 10 secounds so i need refresh only a part of my index.php
[16:19:40] <Less_Seen> dsds it would be good if you make a working jsfiddle (i prefer it to pastebin) - i am thinking you should use setInterval instead of setTimeout that way
[16:20:10] <dsds> http://pastebin.com/6TcPees9
[16:20:11] <gamingdroid> What is the difference between doing   $("form").bind("submit",   and $("#form").bind("submit",    ? In the former, it doesn't seem the entire form is submitted?
[16:20:58] <ipsifendus> do disabled form elements normally not get put into the post params array?
[16:21:16] <ipsifendus> i'm wanting to set a form field as non-mutable but still have it's value come through the post
[16:21:37] <dsds> Less_Seen this is my acutal code.. works good but when it refresh it ignore all my other thinks in my index.php you know i want just to refresh my foreach loop where i get my data so i need to only refresh that every 3 secs
[16:22:37] <krz> $('#top_hits').find('ul li[class$="foo_7"]').length how do image sure this doesn't succeed with foo_77
[16:23:15] <Brodingo> gamingdroid the first selects html form tags, the latter selects an element with the id #form which should be named better
[16:23:44] <krz> anyone?
[16:24:15] <gamingdroid> Brodingo: Why isn't the first selecting the entire form? i.e. the POST data isn't sent from the form.
[16:25:17] <Brodingo> syntax error?
[16:25:18] <ipsifendus> krz: you should try a regex: $("ul li:regex(class, .*foo-7)")
[16:25:37] <ipsifendus> s/-/_/
[16:25:50] <Less_Seen> gamingdroid: are there multiple <form> tags?  $("form") selects all <form> tags, whereas $("#form_id") selects a tag with the id="form_id"
[16:26:58] <gamingdroid> Brodingo & Less_Seen: Entire code is here: http://dpaste.com/749153/
[16:27:55] <krz> ipsifendus: regex don't exist!
[16:27:57] <gamingdroid> Brodingo & Less_Seen: Line 21 & 23 is for django to output the correct input fields and is correct. That is the entire form, and the only thing I change is on line 7, from selecting 'form' to '#form'.
[16:29:01] <gamingdroid> Brodingo & Less_Seen: That is the entire code outputted, but when I check request.POST there is nothing when selecting all form tags, instead of the element with id form.
[16:32:10] <gamingdroid> Anyone have any ideas?
[16:39:49] <huglester> guys is there any regep to get '64' from this string? 'http://test.eu/images/64_profile_261fd7876ca45dbb5eacfc8cf02c7b04.jpg'
[16:41:16] <Azra-el> http://imgur.com/sMJNK   basically i would like to ask.. where should i add the swipe listener? to what element? considering that each li should have a button that i would need to interact with
[16:45:19] <ragnok> hi, can you give me a link to a great photo gallery slideshow plugin with ajax ?
[16:46:18] <ipsifendus> OH, i can just re-enable the element on submit.
[16:49:37] <Azra-el> http://imgur.com/sMJNK   basically i would like to ask.. where should i add the swipe listener? to what element? considering that each li should have a button that i would need to interact with
[17:07:17] <Less_Seen> huglester: this can be useful -> http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascriptexample.html
[17:07:34] <huglester> Less_Seen: thanks!
[17:13:04] <krz> how do i determine if a set of li elements have a class "foobar_1"
[17:13:25] <krz> oh hasClass
[17:28:49] <amaroks> anyone around?
[17:29:32] <amaroks> I have 4 similar onclick functions but when clicking any the actions are made on all of the 4 instead of #divname .classname
[17:30:35] <ZachBeta> is it possible to send html inside of a json response?
[17:35:31] <systemfault> ZachBeta: Not really..
[17:37:22] <ZachBeta> this jquery-file-upload is really not playing nice with my rails forms
[17:39:45] <systemfault> Not sure if it changed but last time I used jquery file upload, I wanted to cry
[17:42:44] <ZachBeta> it's got SUCH potential
[17:43:06] <ZachBeta> but if I want to add any extra fields such a pain
[17:43:31] <systemfault> Not really don't be fooled by its nice twitter bootstrap feel...
[17:43:59] <systemfault> I still have nightmares about it some nights
[17:44:12] <ZachBeta> thing is my current file upload is VERY basic form selects
[17:44:38] <ZachBeta> and it's NOT user friendly, so this has been the best lead I could get without trying to reinvent the wheel
[17:45:07] <systemfault> ZachBeta: These days, I just use the iframe transport plugin.. simpler and more flexible imho
[17:45:20] <systemfault> (The jquery fileupload uses it also..)
[17:49:25] <ZachBeta> systemfault this iframe transport plugin you speak of
[17:49:31] <ZachBeta> what kind of server is that for
[17:49:45] <ZachBeta> *crosses fingers* is it a gem for rails?
[17:49:57] <systemfault> It's a jquery javascript plugin :/
[17:50:30] <systemfault> This: http://cmlenz.github.com/jquery-iframe-transport/
[17:50:37] <ZachBeta> so at the end of the day I'm still rewriting the transport logic for a file upload
[17:51:02] <systemfault> ZachBeta: The file is send as a classic multipart form
[17:51:05] <systemfault> *sent
[17:54:13] <ZachBeta> systemfault checking it out now
[17:59:52] <javajosh> Buenos dias. I'm trying to make filtering work with dynamically generated HTML, and I'm not able to get it to work. I've tried to boil it down to essentails. http://jsfiddle.net/2S5Ec/
[18:00:51] <javajosh> ah, i caught it. my append selector is wrong.
[18:00:59] <javajosh> confessional debugging ftw :)
[18:01:38] <javajosh> that said I'd like to know why I have to append strings to the dom before I get dom-like behavior...
[18:04:24] <javajosh> anybody home? am I not successfully posting to IRC?
[18:09:04] <brianfreud> What event should I use with $(foo).on() to catch the insertion into the DOM of something as a child of foo?  DOMNodeInserted?  Or is there some better event to use, one which isn't depricated?
[18:09:49] <NCS_One> hi
[18:10:32] <NCS_One> is there some way of knowing if a jQuery.ajax request was made?
[18:12:20] <Jon47> brianfreud: there's no event fired when nodes are added
[18:12:27] <Jon47> but nodes don't just get added willy-nilly
[18:12:29] <brianfreud> DOMNodeInsertedis
[18:12:59] <brianfreud> Jon47: I'm in one gm script, trying to catch when someone else's gm script adds something to the dom, so I can then add something after it.
[18:12:59] <Jon47> i don't think you can count on that
[18:13:15] <oojacoboo> can someone tell me what I'm missing here?
[18:13:16] <oojacoboo> http://pastebin.com/ekMWsg3Q
[18:13:32] <oojacoboo> note that the vars are set properly higher up in the function
[18:13:52] <oojacoboo> the submit even never gets fired
[18:13:56] <oojacoboo> event*
[18:16:52] <oojacoboo> ugh. disableForm() method isn't avail on this page ><
[18:28:38] <socialhapy>  Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile Vertical Slider -  http://t.co/rMtNhc6l  http://bit.ly/JLpLv6
[18:29:10] <shoky> oojacoboo: why not something more like:  http://pastebin.com/zS1sDCih
[18:29:57] <oojacoboo> shoky, b/c then I can't do anything with the form submit event
[18:30:11] <shoky> what do you want to do with it
[18:30:15] <oojacoboo> not that I really need to I guess :/
[18:30:27] <shoky> you don't... you dont even want a submit event happening
[18:30:33] <oojacoboo> right
[18:30:37] <shoky> hence the preventDefault
[18:30:41] <oojacoboo> yep
[18:30:44] <shoky> so what's the prob?
[18:30:49] <oojacoboo> no prob
[18:30:52] <shoky> cool
[18:32:34] <shoky> brianfreud: you might need to just check for the DOM nodes you're interested in, periodically
[18:32:51] <shoky> i.e. with setTimeout()
[18:34:01] <shoky> actually if you're in FF only..
[18:34:14] <shoky> then maybe DOMNodeInserted is fine?
[18:42:12] <shoky> nah. setTimeout ftw
[18:57:44] <NCS_One> how do I get elements that don't have display equal to hidden?
[18:58:33] <shoky> ?visible
[18:58:33] <bot-t> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[18:58:34] <olinux> NCS_One, display doesnt have a hidden
[18:59:13] <NCS_One> olinux: ??
[18:59:17] <NCS_One> really?
[18:59:33] <shoky> yes. visibility does
[18:59:41] <shoky> display: none
[18:59:43] <NCS_One> right
[18:59:45] <tw2113> display has none, visibility has hidden
[18:59:46] <NCS_One> its none
[19:00:01] <tw2113> learn your csses yo
[19:00:01] <olinux> tw2113, correct
[19:00:08] <olinux> NCS_One, http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp
[19:00:08] <tw2113> :)
[19:00:34] <shoky> olinux no w3schools.com plz
[19:00:54] <olinux> shoky get over it
[19:00:55] <tw2113> mdn for all your questions
[19:00:55] <caniuse> tw2113: Privacy policy guidelines - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/Privacy_policies

[19:01:16] <tw2113> thank you caniuse
[19:01:21] <shoky> i'll get over you, sure
[19:01:23] <tw2113> *gives caniuse a treat*
[19:07:39] <blindMoe> if I want to unset the 'left' css attribute for an element is the best method to just set it to auto?
[19:09:02] <blindMoe> ahh nm? guess you can just set it to an empty string
[19:09:30] <javajosh> I'm so frustrated by jquery's inconsistent behavior between working with a real dom and working with a string. http://jsfiddle.net/2S5Ec/1/
[19:11:51] * tw2113 needs project work that's more jquery/js heavy
[19:12:09] <tw2113> most of the time the jquery work i do is via plugins i've used many times before
[19:12:26] <javajosh> are there any good guides on how jquery differs between simple string and real dom construction?
[19:12:30] <shoky> javajosh: the behaviour is consistent with the API docs: Elements are considered visible if they consume space in the document.
[19:13:21] <javajosh> shoky: thanks
[19:15:38] <javajosh> shoky: you wouldn't happen to know how jsdom treats visibility rules would you?
[19:16:06] <shoky> what do you mean
[19:16:35] <javajosh> i'm using jquery in node, and the :visible selector doesn't work in the simulated dom, called jsdom
[19:16:52] <javajosh> well, it does sometimes.
[19:16:59] <javajosh> i'm still playing around with it
[19:17:48] <shoky> oh, dunno node/jsdom sry
[19:22:37] <raj> I have two divs. $mydiv1=("<div class='mydiv1'></div>") and $mydiv2=("<div class='mydiv2'></div>"). I need to combine them so I can append them to $('.container') at once. How can i do this?
[19:24:07] <tw2113> $mydiv1 += $mydiv2
[19:24:27] <tw2113> then $('.container').append($mydiv1);
[19:24:47] <tw2113> OR
[19:24:56] <tw2113> why not put the two divs into 1 variable from the start?
[19:25:41] <shoky> += ? seriously?
[19:25:46] <raj> that broke it
[19:25:58] <raj> tw2113, because then i can't do .find() and whatnot
[19:26:00] <tw2113> even better.... $('.container').append("<div class='mydiv1'></div><div class='mydiv2'></div>");
[19:26:12] <raj> there's other stuff going on before they are appended
[19:26:23] <tw2113> now you tell us
[19:26:41] <tw2113> it was an attempt to help shoky
[19:26:42] <tw2113> :)
[19:27:05] <shoky> a serious one? :)
[19:27:38] <tw2113> i don't claim "pro" with this
[19:27:49] <tw2113> my mind went to concatenation first
[19:27:58] <shoky> ok but
[19:28:02] <shoky> oh, are they strings
[19:28:26] <shoky> i thought they were jq objs..
[19:28:36] <shoky> then you just need .add
[19:29:47] * shoky pokes raj
[19:29:53] <raj> word
[19:29:54] <caniuse> raj: bond
[19:30:03] <raj> YES, it's back
[19:30:44] <Back2Basics> why is this sending as html rather than json?  http://bpaste.net/show/6b1kGYwKR0f6hjOzcylk/
[19:50:22] <ngharo> dont stringify, just pass the object in as data
[20:14:24] <brianfreud> How would I filter to the 3rd td in each tr which is a child of a jquery object?
[20:14:51] <tw2113> td:nth-child(2)
[20:14:59] <brianfreud> merci :)
[20:15:01] <tw2113> with the first child being 0
[20:15:07] <tw2113> so 0,1,2, etc
[20:15:14] <tw2113> worth the shot
[20:17:00] <brianfreud> thing is, I still don't think that's really what I need to do...
[20:18:54] <brianfreud> Simplified version of the problem code: http://pastebin.com/2BHGVk2v
[20:19:38] <brianfreud> AFAIK, I don't need line 8.  But even with it, line 9 never triggers, unless I remove the selector arg.
[20:21:56] * brianfreud wonders if every node of a frag inserted triggers that event, or just the highest level node when an entire frag is inserted...
[20:38:18] <krz> how would i truncate text?
[20:44:46] <Aquilas> Hey guys if someone could tell me why this simple, tiny script won't work I would heavily appreciate it

[20:49:54] <sancas> hello i cant use jquery but i dont know why
[20:50:35] <sancas> this my code http://pastebin.com/UPamHET6
[20:50:51] <sancas> but i dont know why the function iniciar not start :(
[20:51:16] <beancurd> poo.
[20:52:27] <sancas> poo?
[20:52:39] <beancurd> i dunno.
[20:52:47] <beancurd> poo is more interesting than test.
[20:52:54] <beancurd> i was wondering if i was still connected.
[20:53:02] <beancurd> anyway. your code, where is it failing?
[20:53:42] <beancurd> if you do something like console.log('i've been clicked');
[20:53:52] <beancurd> in your click funciotn.
[20:54:23] <beancurd> this is assuming you haven't done somithing silly like not linked jquery.js to your page or something.
[21:10:29] <krz> I've got 20 <li> elements in ul. how do i keep the first 10 li elements and remove the others?
[21:14:10] <oojacoboo> krz, you'd prob want a $.each
[21:14:20] <oojacoboo> loop over, count and remove?
[21:14:29] <oojacoboo> or possibly you would use a function with nth-child
[21:14:44] <krz> what about slice?
[21:14:51] <orangey> hello all!
[21:14:56] <oojacoboo> know nothing about that
[21:15:03] <brianfreud> $('li:gt(9)').remove()
[21:15:05] <orangey> is there an easy way for jquery.datepicker to disable all of the dates so that I can only set to true *some*?
[21:15:20] <orangey> beforeshowday seems to force me to individually enable/disable
[21:15:22] <oojacoboo> gt Oo
[21:16:00] <oojacoboo> http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[21:16:04] <oojacoboo> crazy selector
[21:16:15] <krz> slice seems to work
[21:16:24] <oojacoboo> use what brianfreud said
[21:16:28] <krz> .slice(10).remove() keeps the first 1-0
[21:16:32] <krz> first 10*
[21:18:31] <brianfreud> :gt(n) selects only things bigger than n
[21:19:17] <brianfreud> *bigger than n-1
[22:03:07] <psyolus> Would it make sense to have a plugin that, upon initialization, returns a dom element?

[23:10:21] <huntedmitch> Hey guys, can anyone tell me of a plugin that yields a result similar to this screenshot? I've looked at a lot of carousel plugins, but none of them are quite right http://cl.ly/072N303z450E0h0l0539
[23:14:16] <oojacoboo> huntedmitch, http://addyosmani.com/blog/jqueryuicoverflow/
[23:14:44] <oojacoboo> huntedmitch, or http://www.jcoverflip.com/
[23:15:39] <huntedmitch> yeah, all close, but not really right
[23:15:47] <oojacoboo> then tweak them
[23:16:11] <huntedmitch> Obviously
[23:16:17] <huntedmitch> I am using http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout/ at the moment and it's close
[23:16:20] <huntedmitch> And quite well written
[23:16:37] <huntedmitch> But it has some odd behaviours
[23:16:37] <oojacoboo> k
[23:16:48] <huntedmitch> I will persevere with that maybe..
[23:32:28] <Nece228> hello
[23:32:33] <Nece228> how to reset form fields?
[23:32:36] <Nece228> i mean clear them
[23:35:31] <Nece228> is $('form')[0].reset(); a good solution?
[23:36:15] <oojacoboo> Nece228, use an id
[23:36:31] <oojacoboo> $("form#foo").reset();
[23:37:27] <Nece228> oojacoboo: i havent set id for the form
[23:37:33] <Nece228> in fact its the only form on a page
[23:37:33] <oojacoboo> Nece228, http://www.codigomanso.com/en/2008/12/resetear-un-formulario-con-jquery/
[23:39:57] <Nece228> ok so ive set it id
[23:40:55] <Nopik> hi all
[23:40:59] <Nece228> btw i need to do $('#form1')[0].reset()
[23:41:05] <Nece228> without [0] it wont reset
[23:41:18] <Nopik> anyone from Poland here? I'm looking for front-end developers to hire
[23:42:36] <krz> i need a wold map and be able to highlight portions of the map. so when execute (via js), US, it would highlight the US continent in the world map. same goes for other countries. any ideas where i should start / look?
[23:48:42] <lerner> please help understanding this regular expression: RegExp(".*[a-z]{2}[ ].*[d-i](?=.*)");
[23:49:03] <lerner> i am an absolute newbi
[23:51:07] <ryanseddon> lerner: I think it just wants 2 lowercase characters folowed by whitespace follwed by 0 or more characters between d and i
[23:52:05] <Dr-Bombay> no...
[23:52:14] <ryanseddon> or rather 2 or more
[23:52:52] <ryanseddon> >> /.*[a-z]{2}[ ].*[d-i](?=.*)/.test("ab d")
[23:54:06] <Dr-Bombay> it requires at least one character in the range d-i. not "0 or more"
[23:54:07] <Back2Basics> any number of characters .* followed by 2 letters [a-z]{2} a space [ ] any number of characters .* a letter [d-i]
[23:54:29] <Back2Basics> but I din't know how (?=.*) translates
[23:54:45] <Dr-Bombay> (?=.*) appears to have no effect
[23:54:58] <lerner> ryanseddon: hello sir. actually there are total of 14 RegEx to be decoded in order to calculate some string. could you please help.
[23:55:20] <Dr-Bombay> "sir"
[23:56:17] <tw2113> evening ryanseddon
[23:57:11] <lerner> the other one is RegExp(".*[G-Z].*[A-Z].+[f-s](?=.*)");
[23:57:16] <ryanseddon> Back2Basics: (?=) is a look ahead but is kinda of unnecessary
[23:57:37] <krz> anyone: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10631120/how-to-make-an-interactive-map-with-jquery
[23:59:31] <vectorshelve> does anybody know abt openads framework
