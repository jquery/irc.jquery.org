[00:07:47] <the8thbit> jphase: Hm, I've actually settled on isotope, but I'm a little confused by it. It uses an 'element selector' system, which I assume looks for all elements with the provided id/class, and then adds them to your container. However, I only want my elements visible within the container. Do I add my elements to an invisible div and use that to feed isotope, or is there a less hacky way to do this?
[00:09:12] <jphase> the8thbit: you choose a parent and a child selector, the parent acts as container (to calculate the allotted width) and the children get moved around
[00:10:00] <the8thbit> jphase: Right, but where does it pull the children from?
[00:10:10] <the8thbit> Or do I put the children in the container?
[00:10:19] <jphase> you put them in there yeah
[00:10:19] <the8thbit> like, in the html
[00:11:16] <jphase> it's intended to give you some ability to change your html around so it doesn't have to be parent > child but could be parent > something > something > child if you want
[00:13:29] <the8thbit> jphase: Hm, this doesn't seem to be working
[00:13:37] <the8thbit> would you mind taking a look at my code?: http://pastebin.com/SkqmwzQ4
[00:14:02] <the8thbit> they show up like they would normally, rather than being sorted into rows
[00:14:21] <the8thbit> and no errors in console
[00:14:37] <jphase> are you calling badgets.init(); ?
[00:14:50] <jphase> badges.init(); rather
[00:15:14] <the8thbit> yes, because that's whats generating the badges
[00:15:29] <jphase> make a fiddle or something
[00:15:33] <the8thbit> k
[00:15:39] <jphase> and stop using pastebin, it sucks
[00:15:50] <jphase> hastebin.com / paste.ofcode.org / anything else
[00:16:34] <the8thbit> why does it suck?
[00:16:52] <the8thbit> Also, I wish jsfiddle could take Jade and Stylus in addition to HTML and CSS
[00:17:58] <jphase> pastebin.com is riddled with advertisements, doesn't syntax highlight, and for some reason everyone defends it because it is old and has a predictable domain lol
[00:18:49] <jphase> well I guess it highlights, but not well
[00:19:08] <jphase> and no one uses the highlighting - so I point people to hastebin because it's automatic
[00:20:42] <the8thbit> ohhh automatic highlighting
[00:21:48] <jphase> and keyboard commands, and dark, and easy on my eyes at 3:21am
[00:26:32] <the8thbit> jphase: my fiddle isnt fiddling :(
[00:26:33] <the8thbit> http://jsfiddle.net/kXWDL/1/
[00:27:06] <the8thbit> er, this version: http://jsfiddle.net/kXWDL/2/
[00:34:10] <the8thbit> Nevermind, fixed it
[00:34:30] <the8thbit> the issue was that isotope wasn't accessible from the js that was calling it

[02:09:36] <tonythomas> Hi! I wanted to include only the jquery .attr feature to my html page
[02:09:50] <tonythomas> Where can I find the required class so that I can just add it
[02:10:06] <tonythomas> rather than giving an http request to http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js ?
[02:11:23] <surial> I'm doing some research on the effects of gzipped content. For a lot of our internal javascript, the difference AFTER gzip between minified js and normal devvy js is very small. Because live debugging issues at customers and the like is just easier with unminified js, I've recently decided to turn off minifying, based on the idea that almost all content is served gzipped anyway.
[02:12:02] <surial> I've done the same check on jquery, but no go there: unminified 'devmode' jquery 1.8.3 (yes, upgrading to 1.11 is on the agenda!) is almost twice as large even post gzip as the production mode jquery. BUT, I did notice LOTS of comments, and this 'devmode' vs 'productionmode' distinction. What are the differences, other than minified / not minified...
[02:12:28] <surial> and is there an unminified 'production mode' variant? In the mean time, I'm going to strip comments but otherwise leave copyrights and structure intact and see what happens then.
[02:33:45] <sunbeam> i'm trying to load instagram from domain.com/page - it doesnt work
[02:33:51] <sunbeam> however when i load it from domain.com/anotherpage it does
[02:33:59] <sunbeam> any idea how come? Maybe instagram banned /page ?
[02:36:26] <sunbeam> nvm
[02:52:16] <Tomashe> Hey guys im creating mobile app using html/css/js . my pages move works like that, if i go to other page it will remove the html and put new template html of the page the user wanted to go to. My problems starts on my map. when i remove the map html and load it back, i lose my bind and i need to reinitialize everything . i want to avoid it . there is a way to save the bind even if the element
[02:52:16] <Tomashe> is no longer exists and if it get back i just see everything as it was?
[03:05:56] <Joey__> Tomashe instead don't do reloads and just show/hide elements instead?
[03:06:09] <Joey__> - first instead
[03:06:38] <Tomashe> since its big mobile app i discover massive DOM makes everything SLOW
[03:06:48] <Tomashe> so remove and reload from template engine makes it all faster
[03:06:49] <Tomashe> way faster
[03:08:16] <_lazarevsky> Tomashe: Have you looked into jquery mobile
[03:08:57] <_lazarevsky> Tomashe: I used it in an LOB application and it worked beautifully
[03:08:59] <greg_f> Can I ask here about knockout js?
[03:09:29] <_lazarevsky> Tomashe: as long as you write good javascript code (I would suggest looking into Coffeescript, it's worth the invested time), then you should have no problem really
[03:13:15] <Tomashe> _lazarevsky, yes i am using it but again . massive DOM kiiling preformances i must remove / add templates
[03:13:35] <Tomashe> i mean im using jqm
[03:14:02] <_lazarevsky> well really it is only the initial load that's substantial
[03:14:23] <_lazarevsky> Tomashe: since it's a SPA, after everything's been loaded at the client, it should be fairly snappy
[03:15:49] <Tomashe> its not when u're manipulating dom constantly
[03:15:50] <Joey__> is there something (automated) that allows you to write java script in many files (like how you use a file per class in C++/C#, or split large files in modules or partial classes) then combines all those files into a single (preferable compressed) javascript file for inclusion? But perhaps allows you to include all the single files when debugging ?
[03:16:03] <Tomashe> this is not a Content website lol
[03:18:41] <Joey__> or let me rephrase it, what tools do you use heh. Also what browser do you prefer to test your app during development / debugging?
[03:20:28] <Tomashe> ME? chrome
[03:23:08] <hdon> hi all :) on firefox doing $('canvas').click(fn) -- is there a correct way to get the clicked position from the event?
[03:55:40] <F__> hello
[03:56:00] <F__> is there anyone interested in jquery.academy domain name?
[04:15:48] <fels_zh__> hi anyone used owl-carosal .? I've got an issue where it does not show the image.. sometimes.
[05:06:09] <Axel> Hi. Is the ajax callback done asynchronous ? I read settings async to false is deprecated as of 1.8
[05:22:57] <ClarusCogitatio> What is the best way of performing a constant animation without killing the main browser JS thread? (previous attempts simply made my browser crash). currently i have two functions that call each other via the success function of the fadeIn/fadeOut method, which in turn in a delay call the actual fadeIn/fadeOut functions, if it's not that clear here is the gist of it:https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c060498a933ac747e1de
[05:23:41] <ClarusCogitatio> now it seems to me that the way i did it is rather crappy, if anyone has a better recommendation i'll be glad to here, a suggestion i saw online is busy-looping for sleeping as the synchronous way of doing that... that just killed the browser really fast.
[05:53:46] <masterkiller1> how can i execute a function on an element that is loaded from ajax (after page load)?
[05:56:49] <Schalla> masterkiller1: $.on();
[05:57:00] <Schalla> https://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:47:49] <masterkiller1> Schalla: thank you sir (sorry i had to step away)
[06:47:55] <Schalla> No problem
[07:29:25] <jay> hello ben_alman
[07:55:21] <hxm> hi
[07:55:37] <hxm> i want to create a nice table and I found a jquery addon called appendGrid
[07:55:50] <hxm> when I use it in the same way of the demostration I get this error Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'button'
[07:55:55] <hxm> is because I miss some extra library?
[07:56:00] <hxm> i loaded jquery-ui
[07:56:52] <hxm> ah found it
[07:57:01] <hxm> after 2 hours, I come to ask and the solution appears itself
[08:04:12] <santa4x4_> hey, guys :)
[08:04:20] <santa4x4_> anyone got experience using spin.js?
[08:04:41] <Shammah> How can I get the first column of any row? I currently have "$("#clickable-table tr td:first")", but somehow this only works for the first row
[08:05:30] <santa4x4_> what i'm trying to do with spin.js is have the spinner hide the rest of my search results page (wordpress) until its contents all load.
[08:06:21] <santa4x4_> i'm having difficulty understanding the documentation and how to make it do what i need :( -- and my googling seems fruitless to this point.
[08:08:46] <decx> Shammah that's how :first works, you want :first-child
[08:09:25] <Leh> Shammah :
[08:09:27] <Leh> var arr = [];
[08:09:27] <Leh> $("#clickable-table tr").each(function(){
[08:09:27] <Leh>     arr.push($(this).find("td:first").text()); //put elements into array
[08:09:27] <Leh> });
[08:09:37] <Leh> like that for instance
[08:09:40] <decx> that's ridiculous
[08:10:05] <decx> no need for an each that is invoked anyway
[08:11:16] <Leh> but doesnt he get only one then ?
[08:11:20] <Shammah> Actually what decx fixed it solved it partially :)
[08:11:42] <decx> $("#clickable-table tr td:first-child") is a set of all first tds
[08:12:19] <Leh> yeah well ur right sry
[08:12:19] <Shammah> How would I get the tr of that td:first-child? Neither $(this).parent() or $(this).closest("tr") does the trick
[08:12:42] <decx> depends on where you call this
[08:12:56] <Shammah> http://hastebin.com/yafelibefi.coffee
[08:13:38] <Shammah> toggle takes a row (tr) as argument
[08:13:53] <Shammah> it apparantly works for the first row, but not anything else
[08:13:57] <decx> you're passing a jquery object to it
[08:15:08] <Shammah> I actually think it's my own code that fails here ;)
[08:15:16] <decx> what do you want to do? hide the tr?
[08:16:24] <Shammah> Ah nevermind, that piece of code was correct. It was another event that caused a side-effect, because I again was using :first instead of :first-child
[08:16:56] <Shammah> It's working now :D
[08:40:49] <AlexMPS> Hey, I'm new to jQuery, got a question about $(this)
[08:40:51] <AlexMPS> http://jsfiddle.net/ukSNY/
[08:41:21] <AlexMPS> Why doesn't $(this) give the correct offset().top for the image that's being hovered?
[08:42:32] <AlexMPS> offset().left works :s
[08:52:49] <AlexMPS> nvm I think I found it :)
[09:11:03] <Schalla> A quick question regarding selectors. My ide marks #id>li as inefficient jQuery Usage, that is true and if so, what is better?
[09:18:10] <vladikoff> Schalla, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12674591/inefficient-jquery-usage-warnings-in-phpstorm-ide
[09:18:19] <decx> $('parent>child') is less efficient than $('parent').children(), $('parent').find('child') and $('child','parent')
[09:43:59] <tonythomas> Where in the code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js is the code to run .attr defined ?
[09:47:47] <CrowX-> can I do something like this, but instead of using a canvas circle, to use an image with a transparent hole in it? http://jsfiddle.net/adgzW/
[09:54:14] <decx> you can, but it will be messy and less cool
[09:56:37] <CrowX-> decx, how
[09:57:29] <decx> move your image with a transparent hole around with the cursor
[09:58:01] <CrowX-> that's what I said
[09:58:09] <CrowX-> I meant, how could I do it
[09:59:51] <decx> use mousemove, catch cursor position and offset the image
[10:38:46] <hxm> i have a table made in jquery and I want to fill it from the php, is that possible? or what is the correct way to do this
[10:39:40] <decx> how do you 'make' a table with jquery?
[10:40:47] <hxm> i used an addon called appendGrid, it creates a nice table and has its own methods to add rows
[10:40:49] <Jon47>  hxm: it's certainly possible but you'll need an API to pull the data from the server into a format that the javascript can understand
[10:41:22] <hxm> so could bebetter do an ajax request when the page is loaded?
[10:41:57] <Jon47> yeah something like that
[10:47:14] <hxm> ok i will
[11:41:11] <CrowX-> how do I create a draggable image and append it to a div in one line?
[11:48:30] <CrowX-> or how do I make an existing image draggable?
[11:49:04] <CrowX-> I tried $("#imageID").draggable();
[11:49:07] <CrowX-> but it doesn't work
[12:00:03] <tw2113> CrowX-, did you add jQuery UI to your page?
[12:01:09] <CrowX-> tw2113, yes
[12:02:09] <tw2113> no console errors?
[12:02:30] <CrowX-> oh snap
[12:02:55] <CrowX-> I had the jquery ui added like this "<script src="j">query-ui.js</script>" in the hurry :D
[12:03:11] <tw2113> oops
[12:07:54] <chars6> i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong.
[12:08:16] <chars6> i have a form i want to process with ajax, but everytime i hit submit it refreshes the page
[12:08:32] <chars6> i want an input button that does nothing
[12:08:45] <asturel> event.preventDefaulotf or something like this..
[12:08:49] <chars6> and a $('#button').click() that processes it
[12:09:45] <asturel> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/
[12:11:59] <chars6> ok, it stopped refreshing, but my test alert isn't firing either
[12:12:27] <chars6> i was following this guide. i don't understand why he didn't run into the same problem
[12:12:29] <chars6> http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/submit-a-form-without-page-refresh-using-jquery--net-59
[12:12:57] <chars6> the test alert is just some gibberish on the first line of my click event
[12:13:33] <chars6> wait, i think i figured it out
[12:14:10] <chars6> my scripts.js is loaded in my site header, which i've been skipping
[12:14:18] <JohnTheSavage101> chars6: could this plugin help you? http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
[12:15:57] <chars6> JohnTheSavage101: thanks. i think my problem was not including scripts.js though
[12:24:54] <chars6> hmm, that didn't fix it. could someone take a look at my code? it's here http://pastebin.com/e6MYWNu0
[12:25:58] <chars6> it seems the page is reloading and the .click() never happens
[12:27:18] <asturel> alert? use console.log :D
[12:27:57] <asturel> $("form").submit(function(e){
[12:27:57] <asturel> e.preventDefault();
[12:27:57] <asturel> });
[12:27:58] <asturel> try this
[12:31:14] <chars6> asturel: in the first line, do you mean literally $("form")
[12:32:18] <chars6> or like the name or something?
[12:35:32] <asturel> the form's id
[12:36:20] <chars6> no dice
[12:45:12] <chars6> i also tried $('#contact_form').on("submit", function(e) {e.preventDefault(); });
[13:00:04] <blakespot> afternoon
[13:01:50] <blakespot> Small pastebin:
[13:01:51] <blakespot> http://pastebin.com/u746Kbdb
[13:02:13] <blakespot> That conditional on lower1flag ... is that syntactically ok in jquery? It's just js so should be right?
[13:02:23] <blakespot> Whenever I do that it breaks this other part of my page, a menu system
[13:02:31] <blakespot> can I put a conditional in there like that?
[13:12:56] <decx> if (! not if !(
[13:16:30] <BinaryKitten> if (!(
[13:16:53] <BinaryKitten> if (!(correct)) { correct_it(); }
[13:17:08] <aitiba> hi
[13:17:11] <aitiba> ¿how can I get the content of this api http://burujabetech.net/laravel-angular-comment-app/public/api/comments please?
[13:17:50] <tw2113> ajax GET request aitiba ?
[13:19:12] <BinaryKitten> aitiba i'm guessing that's a different server/url to the one you're running on?
[13:19:33] <aitiba> yes
[13:19:46] <BinaryKitten> you'll need ever jsonP (if supported)
[13:20:03] <BinaryKitten> or do a server level request to the api and pass that back (ajax-proxying)
[13:20:36] <aitiba> I make an api and the is to open an html on the browser as file:// and get the content
[13:20:39] <BinaryKitten> there are ways to request the data directly via an ajax get request .. but very long winded and requires that the owner of the target allow it specifically
[13:20:54] <aitiba> this html is to create an android app with phonegap for example
[13:20:55] <Schalla> vladikoff
[13:21:00] <Schalla> thanks for the link, also found it.
[13:21:02] <aitiba> this is what I have: http://pastebin.com/7vvV3aF0
[13:21:11] <BinaryKitten> file:// = local machine you cannot open file:// links via js
[13:21:38] <BinaryKitten> aitiba that won't work due to cross site scripting boundaries
[13:22:02] <BinaryKitten> but should work with jsonP
[13:22:17] <BinaryKitten> should, but not for sure
[13:22:20] <aitiba> BinaryKitten: can I have to add to convert on jsonP?
[13:23:58] <BinaryKitten> aitiba at the moment it might not be possible
[13:24:26] <BinaryKitten> nope
[13:24:30] <aitiba> BinaryKitten: what is what is not possible?
[13:24:31] <BinaryKitten> the site doesn't support it
[13:24:41] <BinaryKitten> you cannot use jsonP
[13:24:56] <BinaryKitten> you'll need to use an ajax-Proxy on your server to make the data request
[13:27:35] <aitiba> BinaryKitten: and why is used a callback on jsonp?
[13:27:52] <BinaryKitten> because that's how jsonP works
[13:27:54] <blakespot> bah
[13:28:21] <jost> aitiba: you could use a HTTP Access-Control-Allow-Origin header for the initial HTML page... not sure if phoneGap supports that or something similar
[13:28:43] <BinaryKitten> it loads the jsonP url as a script with the remote server wrapping the json in a call to the function name specified by the callback
[13:29:02] <aitiba> So I need to call to http://myapi.com?call=callback right on $.get right?
[13:29:28] <BinaryKitten> no
[13:29:38] <BinaryKitten> if your api is the one you've specified
[13:29:49] <BinaryKitten> then it doesn't support jsonP callbacks
[13:30:13] <aitiba> BinaryKitten: yes I know that is not supported now. I se laravel4 and as I read solve that is to change one line
[13:30:19] <BinaryKitten> if you're making your own api and it's hosted on the same url as your jQuery code then you can just use $.get
[13:30:49] <aitiba> no is not
[13:30:51] <BinaryKitten> aitiba if you're going to proxy the request, then you just need to $.get the local url
[13:37:24] <blakespot> Short jsfiddle of my issue
[13:37:25] <blakespot> http://jsfiddle.net/blakespot/4jZS2/
[13:38:01] <blakespot> I want the extended state to remain as long as the mouse is in the green *OR* in the blue
[13:38:17] <blakespot> right now, even if mouse goes from green to blue, it closes
[13:38:41] <blakespot> How can I get this thing to stay extended (expanded) if user mouses into the blue?
[13:38:48] <blakespot> I have been puzzling over this for .. some time
[13:38:52] <blakespot> any help appreciated
[13:39:33] <blakespot> if looking - reload - updated
[13:39:36] <blakespot> txt for clarity
[13:41:16] <LndGoncalves> hi
[14:22:03] <homespot> I updated my jsfiddle problem again. If anyone is ... feeling bored and/or helpful this Sunday. :-)
[14:22:06] <homespot> http://jsfiddle.net/blakespot/4jZS2/2/
[14:45:47] <rofel> OK i have a question about using jquery and rails, its a pretty specific use case
[14:47:07] <rofel> so, on a create list page, i want to have a repeating form, but the thing I am stuck on is: I want to have 2 drop downs, one that updates the other. for instance. the first dropdown will be a list of authors but i want to auto update the second dropdown to then only list publications by the specified author
[14:48:00] <javalover> hey guys I have a very simple file uploader and in my script I have the following: $('#drop').css({backgroundImage : 'url(\'uploads/' + data.files[0].name + '\')'});
[14:48:19] <javalover> now sometimes it works but sometimes it fails...what happens is it doesn't put ' '   around the url
[14:48:43] <javalover> any thoughts on how I can make sure it puts the '' around the url so it displays the image?
[14:49:07] <javalover> actually I could cast to string first lemme see
[14:53:58] <javalover> dangit, all was fine & then just tried again and failure
[14:54:11] <javalover> why isn't it changing my background url properly?
[14:54:23] <javalover> like it gets the right string...but wrong '' property
[15:00:44] <javalover> whyyyyyyyyyyyy lol
[15:06:33] <javalover> ok I put the full file path
[15:06:37] <javalover> and it seems to not have the glitch anymore
[15:07:00] <javalover> no i lied it still exists
[15:07:01] <javalover> wtf
[15:08:03] <javalover> i think it has to do with if the file exists before upload
[15:08:05] <javalover> or after upload
[15:08:13] <javalover> so i have to change the background url upon file being uploaded
[15:30:15] <javalover> ok solved
[15:30:25] <javalover> basically the file wasn't fully uploaded causing html to freak out
[15:30:33] <javalover> changed the switch to upon completion of file upload

[16:41:24] <cjwelborn> got a newb question, trying to create a dropdown combo dynamically. What is the best way to create an element with '<option val="TEST">NAME</option>'? Creating the element itself is the only part I am wondering about, I have several options and I want to know what the best way would be.
[16:42:51] <cjwelborn> I am trying $('<option val="' + value + '">' + name + '</option>') ... but that seems so ugly. Is there a better way?
[16:45:01] <shoky> $('<option>').val(value).text(name)

[19:52:07] <Babalau> hello everyone
[19:52:11] <Babalau> anyone here ?
[19:52:52] <Babalau> anyone available for hire to do a small image slider (or modify the actual one) ?
[19:53:47] <r1chard> Babalau, it's, like, full of image sliders you can download.
[19:54:30] <Babalau> the slider is already created
[19:54:34] <Babalau> needs some small tweaks
[20:03:06] <zumba_ad_> hey guys, we were given a data file and after analyzing, it was not in json format. It's an object. Can this be ready thru ajax?
[20:05:58] <LoneStar99> zumba_ad_:  you are trying to parse the data file?
[20:06:12] <zumba_ad_> no, one sec, i'll post it
[20:06:57] <zumba_ad_> LoneStar99: http://pastebin.com/xkezX18r
[20:07:19] <zumba_ad_> that data is being passed as a parameter to a graphing function from D3 library
[20:07:32] <zumba_ad_> now, I would like to retrieve the data from a data file via ajax
[20:08:06] <zumba_ad_> so I moved that data to a file and used it in ajax
[20:08:30] <zumba_ad_> it's not working
[20:12:54] <zumba_ad_> it worked after changing .success to .complete
[20:13:47] <LoneStar99> so it is working now?
[20:16:01] <_spiderman> hey does anyone have any experience using jquery countdown in a table? i keep getting a liftoffTime not defined error when i run my code? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c6bcf8896dc7c1f8ecb0
[20:18:45] <zumba_ad_> LoneStar99: I am able to see the data now but it's inside responseText
[20:18:59] <tw2113> _spiderman, i wonder if that variable is out of scope
[20:19:10] <zumba_ad_> looks like it's a string. How can I convert it so it becomes a real object?
[20:19:20] <_spiderman> tw2113: itâ€™s not i can console.log it
[20:19:41] <tw2113> from inside that function?
[20:19:53] <tw2113> well the $.each
[20:19:59] <LoneStar99> zumba_ad_:  brb in 5 mins
[20:20:03] <zumba_ad_> ok
[20:20:12] <zumba_ad_> i'll try JSON.parse
[20:20:14] <_spiderman> i simply did a var liftoffTime above var count and my table populates with multiple: [object Object] s
[20:20:28] <_spiderman> tw2113:  yes inside that function
[20:21:09] <tw2113> in the case of [object Object] it sounds like it's referencing the whole thing and not just one property of it which i assume is meant to be a timestamp
[20:22:24] <_spiderman> yep
[20:25:17] <_spiderman> tw2113: if i have a variable array, i want to iterate through each one and display them on a table counting down..
[20:27:35] <tw2113> you still need to get the liftoffTime variable referenced properly
[20:28:03] <tw2113> and holding the right info you need
[20:58:29] <_spiderman> tw2113: i got it to work but it only does the countdown for the first one? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8a5cfb92e3e11293b01d
[20:58:50] <tw2113> dunno
[21:11:12] <_spiderman> bah
[21:14:25] <Velveeta> is dirPred.seconds an array?
[21:30:51] <LoneStar99> have a file that needs to be downloaded, what is the best way of having jquery open -> save as box in browser?

[23:20:29] <Junior> yello ;)
