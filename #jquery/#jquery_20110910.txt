[03:17:06] <RubyTN> I am using shadowbox to display content from another page in my side.  How can I set it up to just display content from a specific div in that external page?
[03:18:21] <JasonWeb> Sean Yup im at that website and link but , How do I link.... a menu item "Login" to the pop up....
[03:18:29] <JasonWeb> maybe im looking too hard into this
[03:22:39] <JasonWeb> Sean Yup im at that website and link but , How do I link.... a menu item "Login" to the pop up....
[03:23:08] <JasonWeb> I know how to create the modal
[03:23:24] <JasonWeb> but how do I create the action of me clicking on a link causing the pop up overlay
[03:23:38] <JasonWeb> instead of a new page
[03:25:07] <sean`> jasonTheNorris, $dialog = $('#dialog').dialog ({autoOpen: false}); $('a.selector-class').bind ('click', function (e) { e.preventDefault (); $dialog.dialog ('open'); });
[03:26:13] <JasonWeb> ahhh its called in the script....  okay I thought I had to create a special a href or something

[03:41:12] <RubyTN> how can I just load a specific div from an external page into a popup using shadowbox.js?
[03:55:54] <overrider> I have a function that summarizes a table column and then alerts the result. Works great, except when i add or change the value of said column (its a price field). How to trigger the summary function each time the table changes?
[03:56:15] <RubyTN> anybody???
[03:57:16] <donCams> overrider $(element).bind('change keyup', function() {});
[03:58:51] <donCams> RubyTN, i think .load has something like that
[03:59:29] <RubyTN> donCams:  tnx, but how would I apply that to shadowbox?
[03:59:47] <donCams> oh...
[04:00:42] <incorrect> i don't seem to be able to serialize() a sortable()
[04:01:01] <becom33> donCams hi , how can we make a notification system like the one in google ?
[04:01:28] <RubyTN> donCams:  I have it working to open an external page(which is another page in my site).  However, I am just trying to get it to show a specific div from the external page.  Any ideas on that?
[04:01:34] <becom33> I googled for hrs to find the techinal name for it , only thing I was able to find is Glowl ,
[04:02:45] <donCams> becom33 what's that? hehe
[04:05:02] <donCams> RubyTN, not familiar with shadowbox
[04:09:12] <incorrect> yay! :D happy
[04:11:43] <donCams> RubyTN, hmmm... I don't know if you can load it inline in your page and hide it at first, then load it as an inline div using shadowbox then show it
[04:24:09] <ruby_on_tails> RubyTN: my nick is better
[04:24:32] <ruby_on_tails> i want to create some fancy linux desktop type effects for my crm dashboard, anyone got good examples ?
[04:24:43] <ruby_on_tails> cant find any good thing on google
[04:25:00] <donCams> you mean like that liquid windows?
[04:25:04] <ruby_on_tails> yea
[04:25:08] <ruby_on_tails> squibbly windows
[04:25:12] <donCams> yes
[04:25:14] <ruby_on_tails> or things that fire up
[04:25:28] <donCams> don't know. heh
[04:25:40] <ruby_on_tails> or if i click on a button the dashlets with chart blur and decrease in size and cast a shadow and more dashlets fly in
[04:26:11] <ruby_on_tails> donCams: hmm
[04:26:34] <donCams> i've seen a bouncing div though
[04:26:53] <donCams> u think that would require canvas?
[04:26:57] <ruby_on_tails> where ?
[04:26:58] <ruby_on_tails> link ?
[04:27:03] <donCams> i mean the squibby windows
[04:27:07] <ruby_on_tails> i would like something with just jquery
[04:27:12] <donCams> < forgt
[04:27:14] <donCams> <forgot
[04:27:30] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[04:27:47] <donCams> i've seen a gallery transition where the image explodes
[04:27:58] <donCams> requires html5 canvas

[04:41:47] <Orphis> Hi there !
[04:42:47] <Orphis> I'm trying to make a page that uses a json webservice that has a limit of 10 requests per second per IP
[04:43:42] <Orphis> Do you have any idea on how I could efficiently (easily ?) limit the request frequency, considering I have a long list of requests to make to that service ?
[04:43:57] <mekwall> Orphis: throttling?
[04:44:01] <Orphis> Yes
[04:44:17] <mekwall> Orphis: that's something you'd be doing back-end
[04:44:28] <mekwall> Orphis: what platform are you building this on?
[04:44:31] <Orphis> I've thought of using the fact that the service returns a 403 when I hit the limit
[04:44:51] <Orphis> The webservice is totally external, that's the spotify metadata api
[04:45:07] <RubyTN> do you guys know of any popups that natively allow you to just display a div of an externally loaded file?
[04:45:20] <mekwall> Orphis: then why do you want to limit the requests?
[04:45:59] <Orphis> Because it allows only 10 requests per second, and I'm could have to make 100 of requests
[04:46:27] <mekwall> Orphis: ok, let me rephrase my question. what are you running backend that relays the requests to spotify api?
[04:46:42] <mekwall> php? .net? node.js? django?
[04:47:04] <Orphis> My backend doesn't relays the requests, I do an $.ajax request directly
[04:47:20] <mekwall> RubyTN: natively? :)
[04:47:33] <Orphis> It's a playlist converter from another service to Spotify
[04:47:43] <mekwall> Orphis: so you do ajax directly to spotify api? Then you're screwed :)
[04:47:56] <Orphis> My backend fetches the playlist from the other service and then uses the spotify API
[04:48:04] <Orphis> Why ? They allow cross domain requests
[04:48:05] <mekwall> Orphis: to throttle the requests you will need some kind of relay
[04:48:35] <Orphis> Why can't I do it natively ?
[04:48:41] <mekwall> Orphis: also, it makes more sense because then you can implement your own cache as well (which means less requests to spotify)
[04:48:55] <Orphis> I could do like 10 requests, wait 2s, and run the next 10
[04:49:21] <mekwall> Orphis: yes, and you're not supposed to have multiple visitors to that page?
[04:49:31] <Orphis> No, that's the opposite, if I use the relay, I would hit the 10 requests per seconde *per IP* very quickly
[04:50:00] <OnkelTem> Hi. How to check is there an element with specific class or id?
[04:50:05] <Orphis> I wouldn't need to scale my service a lot, only Spotify has to
[04:50:20] <RubyTN> mekwall:  I have been googling how to get shadowbox to do this, but can't find anything.  Any ideas how I can get shadowbox to do it or any suggestions for other popups that allow it?
[04:51:03] <mekwall> RubyTN: also, what do you mean by externally loaded file?
[04:51:13] <mekwall> RubyTN: well, how about jquery ui dialog?
[04:51:38] <mekwall> Orphis: ah, now I get what you mean... well you can of course throttle with jquery
[04:51:56] <RubyTN> mekwall:  can it be used in conjunction with jquery.js?
[04:52:29] <mekwall> Orphis: I've got a throttler/debouncer on github: https://github.com/mekwall/jquery-throttle
[04:52:36] <Orphis> Yay
[04:52:42] <RubyTN> mekwall:  by externally loaded file, I mean loading a page in my site into the popup
[04:53:03] <mekwall> RubyTN: jquery ui is the official ui extension of jquery, so yes :)
[04:54:29] <mekwall> RubyTN: and I think that most other dialogs/popup plugins will be able to do so since the loading is taken care of by jQuery
[04:54:46] <mekwall> RubyTN: $("div").load(urlToLoad);
[04:55:11] <mekwall> RubyTN: so essentially, you do $("div").load("hello_world.html").dialog();
[04:56:46] <mekwall> RubyTN: if you dislike my plugin or if you think the docs are insufficient you can check out ben almans throttler
[04:57:09] <mekwall> oh, wrong person... that was meant to go to Orphis  :)
[04:57:12] <mekwall> ?g ben alman jquery throttle @ Orphis
[04:57:13] <bot-t> Orphis, Ben Alman ª jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[04:59:30] <RubyTN> mekwall:  tnx
[04:59:37] <Orphis> mekwall: Reading the code and samples right now...
[05:01:10] <Orphis> It's not exactly what I need in fact
[05:03:02] <mekwall> Orphis: well it will help you accomplish what you want :)
[05:03:13] <Orphis> I could issue 5 requests at the same time and if they return fast, before the second ellapse run other requests
[05:04:25] <Orphis> I would store in a FIFO the timings... and with a cyclic timer run new jobs
[05:04:35] <mekwall> Orphis: well, 10 requests per second you can throttle to 100ms
[05:04:36] <Orphis> I just totally see the algorithm now
[05:04:47] <mekwall> yeah you could
[05:05:03] <Orphis> It will be slower than running a few requests at the same time
[05:05:11] <mekwall> true
[05:06:07] <Orphis> If there's a lost request it would hang, if I have a few concurrent requets it will be okay
[05:06:48] <Orphis> How do I get the error code of an ajax requests ? (404, 403...)
[05:06:50] <mekwall> Orphis: I can code that for you if you want :P
[05:07:15] <mekwall> Orphis: you should be able to get it from the jqXHR object. .status I think
[05:07:32] <Orphis> Hmm, ok
[05:08:03] <Huph> 4
[05:08:05] <Orphis> The algorithm would need to add a delay if there's a 403 on a request
[05:08:09] <Huph> oops
[05:08:43] <Orphis> If the user is running the page on multiple tabs, who knows...
[05:10:19] <Orphis> mekwall: I'd like to code it, but since I haven't coded JS for like 10 years, if you could review the code later, it would be great :)
[05:16:30] <mekwall> Orphis: hehe, I've already started... but got company so can't finish it atm
[05:16:45] <Orphis> I'd be interested to see what you do though :)
[05:18:12] <mekwall> Orphis: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/R4MMz/
[05:18:48] <mekwall> Orphis: my idea with that one is that it can make 10 requests (in any time) each 1 second
[05:19:24] <mekwall> Orphis: if its over 10 requests, it will add the request to the queue and start a timer that will make those requests in the next 1 second interval
[05:19:32] <mekwall> that's the idea at least :)

[05:20:28] <muzone> At my image zoomer at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/Amf8w/ - how do I center the image inside #main_photo (text-align: center; used to work till I applied the JS)?
[05:26:52] <muzone> At my image zoomer at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/Amf8w/1/ - how do I make the zoomed version span the full width of #main_photo? I tried rel="position: 'inside', showTitle: false, zoomWidth: '380px'" as explained on http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom-integration.htm but that did not work.

[06:04:41] <OnkelTem> I need my code to start executing AFTER some js file is loaded. How to do this?
[06:05:42] <OnkelTem> I want to load cufon stuff AFTER Modernizr is defined and using its load() method.
[06:06:22] <OnkelTem> I load Modernizr by adding link to it in the <head>
[06:08:14] <nail_> they will execute in the order you include them (unless you explicitely defer them)
[06:08:29] <muzone> hey nail_
[06:08:38] <nail_> hiya
[06:08:47] <muzone> nail_: got a sec?
[06:09:01] <nail_> yep
[06:09:12] <muzone> At my image zoomer at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/RR6BF/ - how do I make the zoomed version span the full width of #main_photo? I tried zoomWidth: '380px' as explained on http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom-integration.htm - but that did not work :(
[06:09:21] <muzone> Thanks man . . .
[06:11:53] <Whirl3d> Is there any way to check an input character by character as someone's typing without managing keypress events?
[06:13:16] <muzone> nail_: hows it lookin' over there?
[06:21:04] <muzone> http://www.evilmilk.com/pictures/Miss_Chatterbox.htm
[06:27:11] <nail_> muzone: it seems to be capped to the "small" image width
[06:29:06] <nail_> muzone: looking at the js it looks like it doesn't care about zoomWidth when it's 'inside'
[06:29:07] <muzone> nail_: true
[06:29:22] <nail_> it will use the width of the small image, and that's it
[06:29:38] <muzone> nail_: thats messed up! http://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/cat-jeans/item10069766.aspx uses the same script (i think) and they managed to pull it off somehow
[06:31:26] <nail_> muzone: yep, their 'small' image is 400px width
[06:31:39] <nail_> if you set your div width to 233px it will cover it all
[06:31:47] <muzone> oh
[06:31:58] <muzone> nail_: but id like the zoom area to be wider
[06:32:01] <muzone> i guess i can make some compromises
[06:32:02] <manuel_> their source image is bigger
[06:32:03] <muzone> thanks a lot man!
[06:32:09] <manuel_> it has white on the edges
[06:32:17] <muzone> yup thats true
[06:32:20] <manuel_> learn you some web inspector :)
[06:32:34] <muzone> you guys are the best
[06:33:14] <nail_> That can probably be fixed in the cloud zoom js, look at the "case 'inside'" line, it uses 'siw' to set the width, and that's the small image outer width
[06:33:39] <nail_> maybe try setting that to the container width instead
[06:35:49] <muzone> nail_: i gotta set it manually or is there some variable for the container width?
[06:35:55] <muzone> (variable or whatever it's called)
[06:36:45] <muzone> nah actually ill just stick with the small width, i dont wanna do this monkey patching stuff
[06:36:51] <muzone> incase i upgrade the script etc.
[06:37:04] <muzone> thanks a lot though nail_!
[06:37:22] <nail_> no worries :)
[06:41:48] <nail_> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/nail/RR6BF/8/ that's really the problem, I've made the modification and it takes the whole width
[06:42:01] <lecsen> Hi guys
[06:42:13] <lecsen> I've a problem for reading xml with jQuery : http://pastie.org/2513489
[06:42:23] <nail_> that needs more patching though, it acts wrong when the mouse leaves the "small" image area
[06:42:29] <lecsen> I look "start" but no "xml"
[06:45:43] <muzone> damn nail_ !!
[06:45:50] <muzone> what did you do??
[06:46:20] <nail_> muzone: I just added w = sImg.parent().parent().outerWidth(); in the 'inside' case
[06:46:36] <nail_> but as I said, it needs more :)
[06:46:55] <muzone> nice..
[06:47:00] <muzone> really nice
[06:47:10] <muzone> any chance you could take it all the way?
[06:47:18] <muzone> ill give you something cool in return man no worries!
[06:49:06] <Danielss89> Hi, can someone help me why i get this error: "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'countDown'" here: http://sccups.com
[06:49:12] <Danielss89> its like it doesn't register the plugin
[06:51:00] <nail_> muzone: http://jsfiddle.net/nail/RR6BF/9/
[06:52:30] <nail_> but that's really specific for your case, it will probably break or act weird for a normal use
[06:53:01] <nail_> oh yeah it does
[06:53:10] <nail_> try changing main_photo's width to 500px
[06:53:14] <nail_> the background repeats :)
[06:53:45] <nail_> you'll be safer having full width 'small images'...
[06:54:18] <muzone> yo.. this is awesome man
[06:54:20] <muzone> maybe so
[06:54:31] <muzone> i cant go more than 380px due to the other columns on that page unfortunately
[06:54:45] <muzone> full width small images, got it
[06:54:51] <muzone> see pm for reward though
[06:54:53] <muzone> hehe
[06:55:22] <muzone> i hope you like it
[06:57:00] <lecsen> I've a problem for reading xml with jQuery : http://pastie.org/2513489, it write "start" but not "xml"
[06:57:22] <nonny> Hi!! Does anyone know how to find in jquery the first parent of element's parents with display:block?
[07:04:35] <nonny> is there a way to check for a css style (display:block) in a selector?
[07:06:34] <sean`> nonny, you can pass a function in .filter
[07:06:37] <sean`> and then use that function to test
[07:06:54] <sean`> I don't know if display: block is necessary, but also look at :visible and :hidden
[07:08:21] <dr0id> Y0 SEAN`
[07:08:29] <sean`> yoo
[07:10:16] <nonny> sean`: THANKS... i want to now first parent setting the wrapping width of and element so something like:  $(ele).parents().filter(function(ele) { return "block"== ($ele).css("display"); });
[07:10:29] <nonny> sean`: should work??
[07:11:09] <nonny> sean`:  the problem I see is that I need to know the FIRST parent (from element upwards...) and I don't know if that would work...
[07:11:49] <sean`> $.css (this, 'display') is faster nonny
[07:12:12] <sean`> nonny, see closest
[07:12:18] <sean`> instead of parents
[07:12:51] <sean`> oh wait
[07:13:02] <sean`> nonny, yeah, you shoul do .parents ().filter (.. fn ..).first ()
[07:13:59] <nonny> sean`: problem is closest does not take a function in the selector... so first I pick everything and then I can call the filter... :-(
[07:14:24] <N0va`> I'm wanting to automatically scroll to the bottom of a div, easy enough, I'm using: $('div#element').animate({ scrollTop: $('div#element').height() }, 'fast'); however, I don't want it to animate, I've tried a few other things like attr('scrollTo', .. with no luck, can anyone help?
[07:14:38] <sean`> nonny, yes, thats why I corrected
[07:19:14] <misterm> N0va`: http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[07:20:15] <N0va`> Knew it would be easier, cracking, thanks misterm
[07:20:28] <misterm> np
[07:22:57] <nonny> sean`: That worked great!!!
[07:23:01] <nonny> sean`:  targetWidth = $(ele).parents().filter( function(idx)
[07:23:01] <nonny>                {
[07:23:01] <nonny>                    return "block"== $(this).css("display");
[07:23:01] <nonny>                }).first().innerWidth();
[07:23:25] <nonny> sean`: thanks a lot for ur help!
[07:23:45] <SinnerNyx> sagan you here?
[07:24:05] <sean`> nonny, innerWidth returns the first anyway.. so you don't need the first ()
[07:24:06] <nonny> N0va`: can u put 0 instead of 'fast'??
[07:24:26] <SinnerNyx> is it possible to get the width of an element I just created?
[07:24:29] <N0va`> No, i'd previously tried that, misterm's solution works perfectly.
[07:24:29] <sean`> also, nonny I think $(ele).closest (':visible') should work too
[07:24:42] <Elephant> howdy
[07:25:53] <Elephant> So, I'm running fancybox, and I know this isn't really a plugin channel, but it makes ajax requests, and then just "aborts"
[07:26:09] <Elephant> just wondering if there is something I can do to get firebug to spit out more info on the error
[07:26:25] <Elephant> All I see is "GET Aborted" under the console
[07:26:26] <manuel_> you can set breakpoints
[07:26:35] <manuel_> i modified fancybox to use deferred though
[07:26:36] <nonny> sean`: ur right!
[07:26:40] <manuel_> because the ajax thing was just too shifty
[07:26:43] <nonny> N0va`: sorry then :-)
[07:26:56] <N0va`> no worries, nonny :)
[07:27:02] <Elephant> Yeah, this was working just fine the other day.
[07:27:22] <manuel_> https://github.com/wesen/fancy-box
[07:27:28] <manuel_> actually https://github.com/wesen/fancy-box/tree/develop
[07:27:35] <manuel_> and let me look for an example
[07:27:47] <Elephant> k :>
[07:28:35] <henroc> Greetings.  Question: is it possible for a trigger() call to hook a method without a bind call?
[07:29:22] <manuel_> here's a usage example: https://gist.github.com/1208364
[07:29:44] <manuel_> set type to deferred, and promise to a function returning a promise, so for example return $.get("foobar")
[07:29:47] <manuel_> returns a promise
[07:29:57] <manuel_> makes it slightly more explicit and controllable
[07:33:23] <SinnerNyx> if i do: http://pastebin.com/A8x99FBe
[07:33:42] <SinnerNyx> can I get the width of 'div' somehow?
[07:36:50] <mateus73> Hi guys .. what's the best way to open up a new tab window using jQuery and not incurring is popup blocking?
[07:37:09] <mateus73> I am using click event by the way
[07:39:54] <misterm> SinnerNyx: I don't think it will have a width until it's in the document somewhere
[07:39:59] <donCams> most browsers open target="_blank" in new tab
[07:40:04] <imakewebthings> SinnerNyx: elements don't have a width unless they're in the DOM
[07:47:10] <stan_man_can> Can someone help me with https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid ?
[07:47:29] <lecsen> How to read a local XML with jQUery please ? http://pastie.org/2513489
[07:49:16] <stan_man_can> There's no readme and I have no clue where to start with it
[07:49:26] <stan_man_can> http://mleibman.github.com/SlickGrid/examples/example-header-row.html
[07:49:30] <stan_man_can> I want to do something like that but with only two columns
[07:49:35] <stan_man_can> and populate it with my own data of course
[08:04:26] <dabear> lecsen: and whats the problem with that code?
[08:04:45] <lecsen> dabear: It write 'start' but not 'xml'
[08:04:58] <lecsen> dabear: So, it didn't go in the success function
[08:05:18] <dabear> ?demo @ lecsen
[08:05:18] <bot-t> lecsen, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:06:11] <lecsen> dabear: I can't upload my xml
[08:06:22] <dabear> you can upload an example
[08:06:29] <dabear> I don't need actual data
[08:06:37] <dabear> just something that shows the problem
[08:09:44] <RobertV> $('div.highlight').hover(f1,f2);    $('div.highlight').removeClass('highlight');         // even though the DIV no longer posseses the 'highlight' class, the .hover() functionality is still binded to that element?
[08:10:24] <RobertV> .hover() binds to the element, not the class attribute
[08:10:30] <techpled> Can anyone tell me why I can't get what the iser types into a text area with .text()?
[08:11:41] <TeddyMurray> hi, on this page: http://www.amplifygrowth.com/services-solutions/growthmatrix/ im getting this error: http://www.amplifygrowth.com/services-solutions/growthmatrix/
[08:11:42] <TeddyMurray> oop
[08:11:43] <TeddyMurray> oops
[08:11:48] <TeddyMurray> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'accordion'
[08:11:55] <TeddyMurray> am i including the files wrong? or
[08:12:10] <lecsen> dabear: All my code : http://pastie.org/2513489
[08:12:33] <dabear> lecsen: no
[08:12:38] <dabear> I did not ask for code
[08:12:45] <dabear> I asked for a demo

[08:12:55] <bot-t> lecsen, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:13:06] <dabear> I need to see what is happening
[08:13:17] <dabear> not just static text, but something I can debug
[08:14:24] <TeddyMurray> anyone have an idea?
[08:14:31] <TeddyMurray> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'accordion'
[08:14:42] <TeddyMurray> wait... i think im missing a js
[08:14:50] <nonon> Hi! $(el).width() should return 0 if element is not visible. Rigth??
[08:14:53] <TeddyMurray> nop..
[08:15:03] <TeddyMurray> jqueryui and jquery both included
[08:15:16] <TeddyMurray> css too
[08:17:46] <nonon>  $(el).css('display', 'none'); var www= $(el).width(); and www is not zero... what I have missundestood???
[08:18:40] <nonon> I though width() will return ZERO if element not visible!!!!!
[08:18:58] <geekbuntu> has anyone seen anything like an accordion builder/wizard?  wanted to study some models - hopefully avoid a pitfall or two (or twenty)
[08:19:40] <Elephant> So if even using $.fancybox({'href':'http://google.com/'}), it "aborts", does this rule out that I need to re-init fancybox when I change a "href"?
[08:20:45] <henroc> Man, that's really weird.  Calling trigger on a custom object without a bind calls that method if it exists
[08:22:31] <nonon> nevermind... found another way .is(':visible');
[08:28:55] <woopwoop> can someone take a look at this simple show/hide script http://jsfiddle.net/wsFEF/
[08:28:59] <woopwoop> please
[08:32:17] <sean`> woopwoop, you can't have two of the same attributes on the same item
[08:33:29] <woopwoop> lol
[08:33:30] <woopwoop> sorry
[08:33:32] <woopwoop> fixed it
[08:36:20] <mateus73> Guys .. how can I configure routing to have a url like this module/id/
[08:36:46] <woopwoop> thanks
[08:40:16] <geekbuntu> mateus73, which language framework are you using?
[08:40:37] <mateus73> geekbuntu, routing.yml sf1.4
[08:41:01] <geekbuntu> gae?
[08:41:03] <mateus73> geekbuntu, I don't mind if is a dirty script  .. as it's justa presentation
[08:41:17] <mateus73> Ops sorry geekbuntu
[08:41:22] <mateus73> wrong channel
[08:41:41] <geekbuntu> mateus73, either way, you need 'RESTful'
[08:41:50] <geekbuntu> how it's applied may vary though :)
[08:42:12] <mateus73> geekbuntu, :) I agree
[08:42:22] <Elephant> fancybox is being a pain in the behind.
[08:42:46] <Elephant> like $.get() works fine, but fancybox doesn't :(
[08:49:07] <Woet> someone once pasted a link in here

[08:55:24] <remink> Hi guys
[08:56:45] <remink> I'm using jQuery Mobile 1.0b3 and when I watch my page (http://remink.fr/planning) on my iPhone the width isn't resizing. Is there a process for it ?
[09:04:23] <stan_man_can> how can i search through json?
[09:04:51] <stan_man_can> I have var codes = {"name":  "value, "name2": "value2", "name3": "value3" };
[09:05:10] <stan_man_can> i want to search the names and if i find a match keep the name and value
[09:05:14] <dabear> stan_man_can: use a for loop or see ?jquery.each
[09:05:15] <bot-t> stan_man_can, jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[09:07:02] <stan_man_can> dabear: is my json formed properly?
[09:07:29] <stan_man_can> dabear: IRL it looks like this
[09:07:29] <woopwoop> so i have a bunch of links, and I want one to be selected randomly on document ready. is there a built in rand function?
[09:07:34] <stan_man_can> var cbsCodes = { '12NALD': 'AE12M NALD PROMO', '14PKDI': '14 PACK DISCOUNT', '1ST505': 'BUNDLED 1ST DCT505' };
[09:07:51] <stan_man_can> I want to search the "12NALD" "14PKDI" "1ST505" fields
[09:09:04] <dabear> stan_man_can: already told you what to do
[09:09:14] <dabear> and jsonlint.com tells you if your json is valid
[09:11:27] <stan_man_can> dabear: you told me to use a foreach loop, that's about 1/5th of what i was asking
[09:11:56] <stan_man_can> I still have no idea how to target the names/values of the json object
[09:13:12] <dabear> first of all, that is not json. it is just an ordinary key value object stored in a variable
[09:13:42] <dabear> the api pages tells you how you can use jquery.each to search through such objects
[09:15:54] <dabear> you have to be more specific..
[09:16:20] <dabear> ?math.random @ woopwoop
[09:16:22] <bot-t> woopwoop, .fadeTo() - Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/

[09:16:33] <bot-t> woopwoop, HTML5 Parser - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_Parser
[09:16:37] <dabear> gah

[09:16:45] <bot-t> dabear, HTML5 Parser - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_Parser
[09:16:48] <dabear> hm
[09:17:48] <dabear> woopwoop: yes, there is a builtin random function in javascript. you can find more info here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
[09:25:20] <remink> I'm using jQuery Mobile 1.0b3 and when I watch my page (http://remink.fr/planning) on my iPhone the width isn't resizing. Is there a solution to do it automaticly ?
[09:25:30] <remink> automatically*
[09:34:19] <RubyTN> how can I just load a specific div from an external page into a jquery ui dialog box?
[09:34:31] <RubyTN> here is what I have so far:  http://jsfiddle.net/KzC4t/
[09:39:19] <justmozzy> hi guys. I am trying to copy the click handlers from one object to the another. I checked the .data('events') but it is undefined. anyone knows a way?
[09:48:07] <dabear> justmozzy: why are you doing that?
[09:52:24] <dabear> its still possible though
[09:52:31] <dabear> the structure has changed
[09:54:59] <justmozzy> dabear: I'm integrating into another system and I have a button that needs to have the same functionality as one of theirs, however they added everything through php. it would be too messy to redo it like they did and I can't really use .clone because I need the button to also work when javascript is disabled
[09:55:51] <dabear> remember that you cannot copy non-jquery-added events
[09:56:05] <RobertV> .hover() binds cummulatively. is there some way i can specifically remove a handler from .hover()? .hover(f1,f2)  .hover(g1,g2) // can i unbind f1 and f2?
[09:56:58] <justmozzy> dabear: they're all jquery added, but the code is generated on the server side. that's what I meant. sorry
[09:59:36] <dabear> justmozzy: here's a starting point: http://jsfiddle.net/WeRbX/
[10:00:14] <dabear> RobertV: yes, use ?unbind
[10:00:15] <bot-t> RobertV, .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[10:00:37] <justmozzy> dabear: thanks
[10:00:44] <RobertV> yeah, just found it. thanks.
[10:02:18] <RubyTN> why does this load the entire contents of the page instead of just the contents on the '#all' div?  $("#example").load(url + "#all");  note url is the path to the page
[10:02:44] <RubyTN> dabear:  any ideas?
[10:03:39] <RubyTN> when alerted url produces the following:  /versions/1#all
[10:04:20] <dabear> RubyTN: emptyspace is needed to seperate contents from selector
[10:04:38] <RubyTN> dabear:  how can I add that in?
[10:05:15] <RubyTN> dabear:  I tried adding a + '' + in the code, but it still doesn't produce a space
[10:05:31] <dabear> + " " +
[10:07:17] <RubyTN> dabear:  thank you soo much!!!

[10:39:02] <CrashTest_> How do I detect when a dom element is added?
[10:53:31] <RobertV> are you allowed to define your own attributes in HTML?
[10:55:05] <RobertV> too late now
[11:03:00] <troubleman> At http://home.no/dwaynie/test/ - anybody know what's going on with the first image? Try hovering it. The cycling process itself is fine. But why does the first image's cycle images appear when they should have been hidden?

[11:22:59] <Flayks> hi there
[11:23:20] <Flayks> in a scrollLeft "event", how can i load next images appear like lazyload ?
[11:23:48] <Flayks> i have 78 splitted images in a home made panorama
[11:24:06] <Flayks> and it's about 14mo to load
[11:24:20] <Flayks> i search a solution to load images dynamically when i scroll
[11:24:22] <Flayks> it's possible ?
[11:25:00] <jvdev> yep, we use JAIL: https://github.com/sebarmeli/JAIL
[11:25:16] <jvdev> but had to do some work getting it to function correctly on scroll left/right
[11:25:42] <DisruptorOfChaos> Yo yo yo, hear me out white niggas.
[11:25:43] <Flayks> oh, very nice !
[11:25:55] <DisruptorOfChaos> I be from Detroit and I rap about the 313 and I drop beats like a Visa card across your throat.
[11:25:57] <Flayks> thanks jvdev i take a look
[11:26:07] <DisruptorOfChaos> I like my hookers to hold a load gun to my head while they lay me. Is there something wrong with me?
[11:26:18] <jvdev> Flayks i might be able to find our fork of it for left/right
[11:27:03] <DisruptorOfChaos> I got the 313 on my cell and no one gives me any crap--cauz I got four bodygaurds holding my laptop as I walk down the street dropping lines of Javascript and C++.
[11:27:14] <jvdev> Flayks it's pretty custom now for this application we're doing, but i'll pastie it for your review
[11:27:14] <DisruptorOfChaos> I be from the D

[11:28:10] <DisruptorOfChaos> </jQuery MC>
[11:28:12] <muzone> DisruptorOfChaos: i hope you go bankrupt
[11:28:15] <muzone> because that was some weak ass shit
[11:28:34] <DisruptorOfChaos> muzone: lol
[11:29:24] <jvdev> having some autocomplete issues: it's appending to body with display:none instead of appending right after my input
[11:29:28] <jvdev> has anyone had issues like that/
[11:30:10] <jvdev> i'm using the default settings and just an easy $('#autcomplete.autcomplete({source: ['this', 'that']}) for testing and it's not showing up
[11:30:18] <jvdev> what am i doing wrong?
[11:31:17] <Flayks> jvdev: like content.find("img").jail(); and your pastie code?
[11:32:30] <jvdev> we do $('img.lazy').jail() with options for drag start and stop
[11:33:18] <Flayks> jvdev: it loads images at page load, not ?
[11:33:58] <jvdev> it loads on the images coming into window view
[11:41:08] <cakehero> Whats an awesome way to format numbers
[11:41:24] <cakehero> I always want X.YZ <unit> regardless of the value
[11:41:38] <cakehero> for instance, 1.23 M or 1.23 B for 1.23 million / billion
[11:41:42] <cakehero> or 1.23 T for thousand
[11:42:19] <wreel> i assume you wouldn't be satisfied with just using Math.round() with some function that takes a unit and divides appropriately?
[11:43:03] <cakehero> wreel that's what I'm looking at doing now
[11:43:25] <cakehero> wreel just thought there might be some sweetness to doit

[11:54:21] <Keldaros> Hello, i have a question regarding the .load function of jQuery. Lets say i have an <div> named #page in wich i want to load 'externalpage.html' so i do       $('#page').load('externalpage.html');  wich shows the stuff i want wich is good. however i have no idea where jQuery puts it in from a DOM point of view. for example document.write(getElementById('page').innerHTML.length); would show up
[11:54:21] <Keldaros> as 0. How do i access the data inserted in the <div>?
[11:54:31] <Keldaros> My apologies for the wall of text, and perhaps noobish question
[12:02:06] <merlin1991> Keldaros: don't kill me on that one but I think to have that work you need either document.write(getElementById('page').get().innerHTML.length); or document.write(getElementById('page').html().length);
[12:02:48] <merlin1991> err
[12:03:00] * merlin1991 sees the lack of jquery in getelmeentbyid and scraps the idea
[12:03:09] <Woet> ah
[12:03:12] <Woet> getelmeentbyid
[12:03:14] <Woet> i use that all the time
[12:03:28] <Woet> Keldaros: what is your question? it puts it in the div #page
[12:04:32] <merlin1991> he's asking where the content ends up in the dom, because his code for checking innerhtml of the div he fills shows him a lenght of 0
[12:04:55] <yeays> Hello, Is this http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ free to use and modify?
[12:06:10] <Keldaros> yes merlin is correct, basicly is there any way to get to / edit the content loaded with the .load() function. i can't seem to access or even find it.
[12:06:33] <Woet> yeays: this is #jquery, not legal advice
[12:06:40] <Woet> yeays: read the disclaimer at the top of http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.8.1/jquery.validate.js
[12:07:05] <yeays> alright
[12:07:10] <yeays> thanks
[12:11:40] <merlin1991> Keldaros: I believe your problem is that you want to change the html before it's loaded
[12:11:42] <merlin1991> .load is async
[12:12:15] <merlin1991> put your document.write code into the complete function
[12:16:12] <Keldaros> merlin1991: I've tested that and and it works! Thanks alot for helping me on this i appreciate it
[12:44:34] <rickup> I have this snippet I use when people make me use target="_blank" ( I actually use rel="external") that I was hoping I could use in reverse to find target="_blank" and modify that to a rel="shadowbox"   http://pastebin.com/pFU9ZhKg
[12:47:21] <rickup> so my attempt was this http://pastebin.com/8pyBpP1r  which doesn't seem to work
[12:49:40] <Flayks> rickup: maybe a return false; in the click event?
[12:50:38] <rickup> lik before $(this).attr('rel','shadowbox');  ?
[12:50:52] <Flayks> after the });
[12:50:56] <Flayks> before*
[12:55:16] <osugregor1> rickup: what is the exact function u want, right now ur just saying if theres a link with target="_blank", also add a rel attribute?
[12:55:41] <rickup> yep
[12:55:44] <rickup> osugregor1,
[12:55:57] <osugregor1> rickup, thats what its doing
[12:56:00] <rickup> I have this http://pastebin.com/V7P5E5Km but I am awful at jquery still
[12:56:38] <rickup> with that return flase; in there nothing launches now
[12:57:20] <osugregor1> what do you want to launch?
[12:57:38] <rickup>  a URL in a shadowbox
[12:57:53] <rickup> this still launches a new tab http://pastebin.com/cKJWWPvP
[12:57:57] <osugregor1> what is the shadow box you are using?
[12:58:03] <rickup> I took out the return false;
[12:58:55] <rickup> let me get a previous eaxmple
[12:58:56] <osugregor1> http://www.shadowbox-js.com?
[12:59:05] <rickup> oh yes
[12:59:10] <rickup> ler me verify
[12:59:22] <rickup> yep thats it
[13:00:34] <rickup> so I use it all the time like this
[13:00:34] <rickup> rel="shadowbox[field_node_gallery_image]"
[13:00:46] <rickup> but I have control over the html when I do that
[13:02:02] <rickup> but here it would be quite a bit of work to make this html actually use a rel instead of a target so I was thinking of all the other stuff I have gotten away with using jquery
[13:02:08] <osugregor1> http://jsfiddle.net/dBLwP/1/
[13:03:03] <osugregor1> try that
[13:03:51] <osugregor1> sorry, had an extra comma just updated it
[13:04:08] <rickup> ah
[13:04:09] <rickup> ok
[13:04:12] <rickup> 1 sec
[13:06:13] <osugregor1> if you already have a shadowbox initiated your better off checking if the rel attribute already exists and using Shadowbox.setup instead
[13:07:03] <rickup> yeah I should rewrite it but I am out of time and its an older thing so they only uses target
[13:07:28] <rickup> this isn't working maybe the URL is the problem
[13:07:32] <rickup> its a google map url
[13:07:43] <Flayks> how can i make a javascript table like imgs = ["img1.jpg", "img2.jpg"...] in a for ?
[13:07:45] <rickup> let me try a normal url
[13:08:55] <rickup> ok I see there are both a target and a rel now
[13:09:11] <rickup> so noether launch
[13:10:11] <rickup> so if I can chop out the target I bet it will work
[13:10:55] <osugregor1> add $(this).attr("target", "");
[13:10:55] <osugregor1> before the return false
[13:12:20] <rickup> ok I sort of see how these work - that lost the rel and kept the target
[13:13:21] <rickup> so the first one I guess I should chop out the  target  with and the second one to add the rel
[13:13:24] <rickup> perhaps
[13:13:33] <osugregor1> here
[13:13:36] <osugregor1> is this what u want?
[13:13:40] <osugregor1> http://jsfiddle.net/dBLwP/7/
[13:15:09] <rickup> let me try min malfunctioned
[13:18:21] <rickup> ok better than mine... but target is there as target="" and shadowbox doesn't launch still - does not launch of jsfiddle either
[13:18:27] <rickup> wait
[13:18:29] <rickup> there it went
[13:18:32] <rickup> maybe its me
[13:18:41] <osugregor1> yah it takes two clicks u first have to check and see if rel is there
[13:19:04] <osugregor1> if it isnt, add it, init it with shadowbox
[13:23:39] <rickup> so I did see it work on jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/dBLwP/7/  like you said but with 2 clicks but the actual page doesn't - weird  let me manually doce a temporary one
[13:23:50] <rickup> and thank so for your help so far osugregor1
[13:30:09] <bryricker> hey guys, I'm trying to remove all form elements with class .new_song_form which have all empty inputs. This is my attempt but it give me "unexpected identifier". $('#playlist-entry .new_song_form').remove() if $(this).find('input').val() == '';
[13:31:58] <rickup> weird so it works on jsfiddle yes but not on my actual page - if I manually code it with the target.  A correctly coded shadowbox launches loads from the same page
[13:37:16] <rickup> ok so if target is the problem...
[13:37:39] <osugregor1> its not, are the links dynamically loaded on the page?
[13:37:56] <osugregor1> or are the links on the page when the dom has loaded?
[13:38:03] <rickup> I can generate these links without the target at all is there a way to just add a rel to the a tag? and not try and replace target ?
[13:38:51] <rickup> I can show you the actual page do you mind ?
[13:38:59] <rickup> taking a quick look?
[13:39:16] <osugregor1> yah
[13:41:18] <rickup> So there are 2 test links one with target like you did on the jsfiddle and one below that both titled Test Link
[13:41:24] <rickup> and the map image way down the page
[13:44:19] <Mr_Grim> hey
[13:44:52] <Mr_Grim> does anyone here use fancybox? if so does anyone know how to  programatically active it to display the contents of a hidden div tag?
[13:46:52] <BrixSat> morning guys :)
[13:47:57] <BrixSat> im having a problem on  "	$(document).keypress(function(event) {" cause it does not functions on textbox's for example  :/ i would like to be global to the page (or tinymce editor area)
[13:55:52] <b0c1> hi
[13:56:04] <jigz> hi
[13:57:19] <b0c1> jquery ui sortable not work in 6.0.2 and chrome 13
[13:57:20] <rickup> thank you very much osugregor1 for those of you who missed it:  To replace a target="_blank" with a rel="shadowbox" a one liner $('a[target="_blank"]').attr("rel",¬†"shadowbox");  will work
[13:58:06] <rickup> last question why would http://google.com load but not the google map link http://maps.google.com/maps?q=13850+Ballantyne+Corporate+Place+Charlotte,+NC+28277&client=ubuntu&channel=fs&oe=utf-8&gl=us&t=m&z=16&vpsrc=0   ?
[13:59:28] <osugregor1> try encodeURI
[13:59:29] <rickup> the iframe launches in the shadowbox but the body tags for the iframe are empty
[13:59:39] <bjensen> Um in a callback I add a query element into a normal js array‚Ä¶If I then do a indexOf on the very same element  it can't find it...
[14:03:05] <rickup> ok encodeURI looks correct thank you... can it be part of that one liner or does this complicated?
[14:03:48] <rickup> the examples I see are hard coded URLs easily done with document.write(encodeURI(uri)+ "<br />");
[14:09:34] <rickup> ok encodeURI(uri) actually won't work with + (plus signs) fyi
[14:11:54] <rickup> so it will likely be encodeURIComponent  so for this... there is only 1 URI  per page so if I can encodeURIComponent  all URIs on the page it might work
[14:17:50] <osugregor> rickup found out why
[14:17:54] <osugregor> http://www.rivercitystudio.com/blog/2011/09/google-maps-embedding-x-frame-options-change/
[14:18:10] <rickup> checking it out
[14:18:45] <Kamakazi> any better plugins for tabs than jquery ui?
[14:18:49] <osugregor> this should work, but only if all links will be google map links
[14:18:49] <osugregor> http://jsfiddle.net/D5kGm/
[14:19:00] <osugregor> srry, that was for rickup
[14:25:12] <rickup> osugregor, I replaced the first function with that one and I lost the shadowbox and it opens in new tab
[14:25:25] <rickup> but
[14:25:43] <rickup> if you go back to that page and look at the 2 text test links  1 works and 1 does not
[14:26:11] <rickup> Test Link 2 works as shadowbox still but map is black
[14:29:36] <rickup> let me manually add embed first
[14:29:45] <rickup> that is definitely not happening
[14:32:59] <rickup> ok adding  &amp;output=embed  to the URL is definitely the solution
[14:33:46] <rickup> programatically/automatically that snippet http://jsfiddle.net/D5kGm/ did not work
[14:34:57] <rickup> it launched a net tab - no shadowbox
[14:35:04] <rickup>  /s/net/new
[14:39:27] <aTm2011> has anyone messed with boilerplate>
[14:39:40] <aTm2011> ?
[14:40:07] <haizum> http://snipt.org/xnQk
[14:40:14] <snover> no, nobody ever.
[14:40:22] <haizum> can someone check that out, i can't get a basic .fadeto and .fadeout function to work
[15:08:29] <xenyz> Can anyone shed some light as to why I keep getting $(this).qtip is not a function with this: http://pastie.org/2515490
[15:09:11] <xenyz> The strangest thing is that it works fine when I'm not logged in to the CMS, so I figured the CMS was messing with jQuery. But isn't that a safe way to use $ ?
[15:09:13] <dabear> xenyz: for some reason the qtip code is probably not loaded..
[15:09:39] <xenyz> But it's in the page header, way before this code
[15:10:17] <xenyz> I thought it had more to do with using $(this) instead of jQuery(this)
[15:10:24] <dabear> nope
[15:10:29] <xenyz> hmmmm
[15:10:36] <dabear> it is wrapped in a function mapping $ to jQuery
[15:11:48] <haizum> do you need to map $ to jquery? i thought it was a universal
[15:11:58] <dabear> nope
[15:12:04] <haizum> thats what i thought
[15:12:12] <dabear> not if some other library is used and that lib overwrites it
[15:12:26] <haizum> i still can't get jquery to work :/
[15:12:40] <haizum> http://snipt.org/xnQk
[15:12:48] <haizum> trying to get those fade effects to work all day
[15:13:22] <xenyz> So it has something to do with the way qtip loads itself then..
[15:14:05] <dabear> xenyz: probably more of a pebkac issue I think
[15:14:24] <dabear> xenyz: need to see a demo
[15:14:28] <dabear> ?demo @ [[zz]]
[15:14:29] <bot-t> [[zz]], Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:14:33] <dabear> ?demo @ xenyz
[15:14:34] <bot-t> xenyz, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:14:41] <dabear> [[zz]]: sorry, not for you :)
[15:14:45] <xenyz> dabear: heh believe me that's entirely possible. But again, the thing works 100% fine when I'm not signed into the cms, so I figured the cms is doing something strange with jquery
[15:16:04] <xenyz> dabear: Do you want to sign into the site to see? I can set up an account pretty quick
[15:16:51] <dabear> xenyz: you said the issue occured when not signed into the cms. why do I then need an account?
[15:17:05] <xenyz> If you don't sign in it'll work perfectly :)
[15:17:16] <xenyz> It's when you're signed in the problem occurs.
[15:17:54] <dabear> ahok
[15:17:54] <dabear> I can take a quick look then
[15:18:01] <xenyz> ok i'll msg you an acct
[15:18:23] <sneakyness> I'm at a hackathon right now, there's an Alvin Wang here wearing a jQuery shirt
[15:18:58] <haizum> haha
[15:20:31] <kggle_> happy terrorday! :)
[15:21:43] <dabear> kggle_: you too!
[15:48:11] <dabear> xenyz: hope it starts working now :)
[15:49:00] <xenyz> dabear: Yeah I'm trying to figure out how they switched up adding js to the header. opendiff on the mac is pretty handy :)
[15:51:17] <coral> http://jsfiddle.net/8DJzW/2/
[15:51:20] <coral> how can i change the values of

[15:51:26] <xenyz> dabear: good eye though, I wouldn't have seen it
[15:51:28] <coral> in the function call
[15:51:52] <dabear> xenyz: I know ;D
[15:54:11] <Jbud> Hello to the jQuery guru's
[15:54:21] <Jbud> I have a qs, if one of you might be able to help me
[15:54:32] <Jbud> I'm trying to implement Comet into one of my webapps, specifically a chat system
[15:55:09] <Jbud> I'm using the forever iframe method of Comet, and I'm noticing a problem that while the iframe connection is open, I can't make any AJAX calls
[15:55:33] <Jbud> I try calling AJAX or JSON, but the calls don't go through until AFTER the iFrame connection is closed
[15:56:00] <Jbud> Is this normal expected behavior? I looked all over Google but I couldn't find anyone with similar problems
[15:57:42] <Jbud> Any ideas? Is there anything I can do to fix this? Maybe a way to temporarily suspend the iframe during downtime?
[16:04:18] <dabear> xenyz: ah, you closed the account :(
[16:04:36] <xenyz> dabear: why you wanted to see more? ;)
[16:04:55] <dabear> xenyz: you could've seen it probably by looking at jQuery.cache[1] on page load and on a breakpoint when the error occured
[16:05:29] <dabear> e.g. ther efirst jqueryexpando property would be different
[16:05:37] <dabear> the first*
[16:05:46] <xenyz> ya good point
[16:06:00] <xenyz> I just never expected the cms to put a second query in
[16:06:18] <xenyz> But I think I know why, it's because my js urls don't have the &v=cachebustingcode on them
[16:06:32] <xenyz> so it does an array merge but they're different urls ?. blah blab balh
[16:07:06] <xenyz> wtf autocorrect thinks jquery is query
[16:07:21] <xenyz> I gotta correct the autocorrect
[16:09:16] <Asido> anyone can help me with this. i have a div container which content changes on some events. when the content changes, the elements whichi supposed to have 'click' listeners doesn't work anymore
[16:09:39] <Asido> those elements are inside that div
[16:12:04] <dabear> Asido: jquery selectors select elements THAT CURRENTLY exists on the page
[16:12:28] <dabear> you describe a siutation where new contents is added (and old ones deleted) from a container
[16:12:37] <dabear> those WILL NOT be matched
[16:13:14] <dabear> Asido: see ?live

[16:14:58] <Asido> thank you guys, that should work
[16:16:29] <Asido> yep, it does
[16:25:03] <meinmkv> kind of a best practices question i suppose - revamping an entire web application to become more of a fat client which is going to require a large stack of $.ajax calls and a substantial amount of client events. my biggest challenge is organizing this is the best manner possible - are there any resources out there for developing enterprise level applications and jquery?
[16:27:12] <meinmkv> or would this be better suited in #jquery-dev?
[16:27:43] <meinmkv> sorry - got bounced for a moment if anyone answered the q above

[17:15:15] <nathggns> :)
[17:27:19] <xenyz> dabear: I finally got it all working, it was a custom mod I made which interfered with the CMS detecting that jquery had already been added to the header
[17:27:38] <xenyz> dabear: thanks again for your help I was pulling out my hair yesterday over this
[17:28:07] <nathggns> Creating a plugin that makes styleable scrollbars is so much eassier than i thought

[18:47:17] <JohnnyDavidson> Why won't this work?
[18:47:29] <JohnnyDavidson> $(document.body).append(x);
[18:48:40] <SvcGhost> Hey guys, if someone can briefly look at this and summarize what it does, I would REALLY appreciate it. http://pastebin.com/CCQcknS7
[18:48:50] <JohnnyDavidson> nevermind
[18:54:36] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there like an 'create' bind?
[18:54:53] <JohnnyDavidson> Essentially I want to do a live bind to everything as soon as it gets created for example
[18:55:06] <JohnnyDavidson> $('div').live( ... )
[18:55:15] <JohnnyDavidson> I want each new div that gets created to do ...
[18:56:10] <SvcGhost> What are your guys' favorite things to do with jQuery?
[18:57:32] <ajpiano> JohnnyDavidson: you can't use .live() for that
[18:57:41] <ajpiano> you can only use liveQuery
[18:57:44] <ajpiano> ?g liveQuery
[18:57:46] <bot-t> ajpiano, Plugins/livequery - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[18:58:08] <ajpiano> SvcGhost: DOM manipulation and AJAX
[18:58:11] <ajpiano> etc.
[18:58:20] <ajpiano> i wouldn't describe those things as "my favourite things"
[18:58:29] <ajpiano> that's like asking "hey guys, what's your favourite thing to do with a hammer?"
[18:58:35] <SvcGhost> ajpiano, you don't need jQuery for AJAX though
[18:58:56] <ajpiano> correct....
[18:59:22] <draginx> Whats aquick way to send all POST data?
[18:59:28] <draginx> within ajax..
[19:03:00] <JohnnyDavidson> svcghost you can program everything in assembly, doesn't mean it's the best way
[19:03:23] <JohnnyDavidson> oh he left :(
[19:04:28] <JohnnyDavidson> aljpiano i don't understand the difference between live and livequery
[19:04:50] <ajpiano> JohnnyDavidson: live is nothing more than event delegation
[19:04:59] <ajpiano> livequery lets you do the whole "bind to new element creation"
[19:05:05] <ajpiano> assuming those new elements are added via jQuery methods
[19:05:31] <JohnnyDavidson> Live does that too though
[19:05:40] <ajpiano> no it doesn't.
[19:06:00] <JohnnyDavidson> If you bind with live, say all divs, then create a div and add it to the dom, the new div will have the bind
[19:06:20] <ajpiano> that's event delegation
[19:06:35] <ajpiano> that is decidedly *not* the same thing as "binding to the fact that a new element has been created"
[19:07:12] <ajpiano> which was the question that you asked
[19:07:35] <JohnnyDavidson> Actually it wasn't really, but I guess I wasn't clear my actual question was supposed to be
[19:07:59] <JohnnyDavidson> I want a function to be called when a new element is created, but I don't really need a bind I guess for that
[19:08:16] <ajpiano> ideally, you don't, correct
[19:08:20] <JohnnyDavidson> I was thinking there might be like $('div').live('oncreation',...) etc
[19:08:22] <ajpiano> you know when the element has been created, so act on it.
[19:08:27] <ajpiano> that's what livequery does though
[19:08:39] <ajpiano> is $("div").livequery(function() { });
[19:08:48] <JohnnyDavidson> and then you create a div and
[19:08:51] <JohnnyDavidson> the function is called?
[19:08:51] <ajpiano> not that i would necessarily advocate yusing that at all
[19:09:16] <ajpiano> yes
[19:09:20] <JohnnyDavidson> Yeah I wasn't thinking it through, I can just call the function when I add it to the DOM
[19:09:25] <snover> it is about as performant as a sack of dead cats
[19:09:30] <ajpiano> yes, correct
[19:12:12] <draginx> is there anyway to gab html from a website in place it into an iframe with jquery?
[19:12:18] <draginx> iframe needs src attribute me thinks :(
[19:12:30] <draginx> the website is dynamic (cant just throw a src attribute)
[19:22:57] <JohnnyDavidson> I can't seem to get everyTime to work
[19:35:17] <JohnnyDavidson> Hey I want something to happen when I just move my mouse at all when it is clicked is that possible?
[19:37:17] <JohnnyDavidson> Like is it possible to do a bind with multiple requirements?
[19:37:46] <JohnnyDavidson> Anyone?
[19:42:31] <draginx> Is there a way to upload an image with jquery? O_o
[19:47:18] <JesperA> draginx, jQuery is frontend
[19:47:53] <draginx> JesperA: yeah I meant like throwing binary data
[19:47:56] <draginx> I think i got it though :)

[21:15:01] <raburto> does anyone know if there's a graph/chart that can be done with jquery
[21:15:05] <raburto> ?*
[21:15:29] <raburto> something similar to visifire.com...
[21:22:24] <raburto> hello?... any suggestions?
[21:25:49] <coldhead> raburto: i use and endorse flot
[21:26:28] <gjvc> flot is pretty good
[21:27:15] <gjvc> coldhead, i'm using it for some unix system metrics charting.  one problem i'm having is that i'm pulling back too many data points from the server
[21:29:14] <gjvc> i'm just doing time-series data so i guess i should just divide the time period by the number of points and then walk through them comparing their timestamps to a "time pointer" which moves in increments of (time period / number of points)
[21:30:06] <raburto> gjvc: Thanks! I'll try it out. I'm trying to use it to create charts for my VMWare custom process.
[21:30:24] <raburto> customer backup process*

[21:45:50] <Jon47> type your exact question into google
[21:46:02] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there a standard though?
[21:46:04] <Jon47> or check out box-rotate at css3please.com
[21:46:18] <paul_irish> best website ever
[21:52:31] <JohnnyDavidson> Can you not store decimal numbers as element attributes?
[21:56:20] <JohnnyDavidson> Also how do I get mouse coordinates?
[22:06:03] <JohnnyDavidson> Anyone know how I can get mouse coordinates without an event?
[22:06:19] <JohnnyDavidson> Just at the given time of needing them, not at the time of the event.
[22:31:33] <cevarief> Hi is it possible to call function from string like in php? like "my_function"();
[22:31:55] <cevarief> or any idea?
[22:36:06] <JohnnyDavidson> What do you mean?
[22:36:16] <JohnnyDavidson> Why would you need to use a string?
[22:40:14] <cevarief> @JohnnyDavidson i need to add somekind of hook function based on string option
[22:41:05] <cevarief> i predefined some function, so when meet the string i just call it rather than using switch() or if then else
[22:53:22] <Davey> so, if I call $('#someform').submit(function() { }); will it call both functions?
[22:54:06] <Davey> apparently, yes :)
[23:43:08] <NielsNL> hello all,
[23:43:28] <JesperA> hi
[23:43:47] <NielsNL> I have some question using the validation options together with the ui-tabs
[23:44:02] <JesperA> yeah
[23:44:04] <JesperA> ask em
[23:44:35] <NielsNL> Somehow when someone is entering a form and forget to enter some fields in an other tab
[23:44:52] <NielsNL> he does not get notified correctly.
[23:45:04] <NielsNL> any idea how to solve this?
[23:48:02] <NielsNL> Hmmm it looks like it is not validated at all :(
[23:51:43] <JesperA> does the form work properly? Except for the validation?
[23:53:08] <NielsNL> what do you mean?
[23:53:46] <NielsNL> all other jquery stuff is working within the form (when you mean this)
[23:55:02] <JesperA> yeah like <form> <tabs></tabs></form>    Then i doubt your problem has anything to do with the ui-tabs
[23:59:54] <NielsNL> Yeah that works but, the tab is not opened when there are required fields are in that tab
