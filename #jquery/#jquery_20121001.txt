[00:00:54] <anli_> Is there a jquery file uploader like http://www.fyneworks.com/jquery/multiple-file-upload/ that uses html5:s multiple="multiple" attribute?
[00:03:21] <onats> sigurding: http://pastie.org/4889794
[00:03:30] <onats> and it still shows me a open or save choice
[00:04:05] <sigurding> onats: ok, did you check your IE regarding accepted content types?
[00:04:33] <onats> sigurding: i haven't used IE in yearsâ€¦ could you guide me which setting is that found in?
[00:05:49] <sigurding> onats: no idea, same here with IE
[00:05:53] <onats> haha ok
[00:07:08] <onats> http://www.entwicklungsgedanken.de/2008/06/06/problems-with-internet-explorer-and-applicationjson/
[00:07:12] <sigurding> onats: honestly I don't even know if there is an option for it. But based on your output that's the last corner where the error might be
[00:07:28] <onats> it should be text/javascript but i get another problem
[00:07:36] <onats> oh no, i think this is what's going to eat up my time
[00:08:59] <noregret> Whirl3d: $(this).parent().after('<td></td>'); this is what i actually want, since it's like <td><div this></div></td>
[00:10:24] <noregret> Whirl3d: so i want only one td to be added next to this td, but if that line is called (triggered by a click), it will add several tds
[00:13:15] <noregret> is called several times *
[00:15:43] <anli_> Is only <!doctype> accepted as html5?
[00:15:54] <anli_> Or do I have to write <!doctype html>?
[00:18:14] <maxaud> question, I have a script where I add and remove classes. They classes may already be assigned with adding and they may not be there when I remove them. Is it best practice to check if it hasClass before adding/removing? or does jQuery do this for me? Does it slow performance when using hasClass?
[00:19:21] <blackspotwiggins> maxaud, im pretty sure that you can just use add/removeClass as before
[00:19:27] <blackspotwiggins> the overhead is minimal
[00:20:21] <maxaud> ok, so the checks (hasClass) probably aren't worth it and there isn't any harm using addClass on an element that already has that class or using removeClass on an element that doesn't have the class?
[00:20:49] <blackspotwiggins> yea
[00:21:16] <maxaud> ok, thank you.
[00:30:03] <Mateutek> Hi , is there a way to display data from ajax in pairs of three, for example i have users in DB and i want to get their name,login,and some other values. and i want to show on screen only 3 of them but in the loop like 1,2,3 ... 4,5,6 .... and so on
[00:30:44] <sigurding> Mateutek: use paging in your query
[00:32:09] <Mateutek> hmm not bad idea, but how to know when to return to beggining
[00:37:14] <noregret> anybody uses ajaxForm() ? it's not selecting in the future, any ideas around that ?
[00:44:47] <noregret> anybody uses jquery form plugin malsup
[00:46:28] <omolio> hi, all I know is the span Element in this paragraph: http://jsfiddle.net/Pqgr9/. What I wanna do is split the Paragraph right after the span Element. Any ideas how to do it?
[00:46:47] <omolio> At the end I want two paragraphs
[00:48:53] <omolio> The thing with split and join is that I loose my data on the elements
[01:03:24] <noregret> i have a text field, and pressing enter on that field always posts to teh current page, and as far as i can see, no event is attached to it, so wth is going on ? how can i stop it or find the hidden event ?
[01:04:43] <beachandbytes> use developer tools and monitor events
[01:05:11] <noregret> can i use firebug for that ?
[01:06:42] <beachandbytes> ya
[01:06:53] <noregret> beachandbytes: ic an't see any events...
[01:06:56] <beachandbytes> or just write a little script to catch keypress
[01:06:59] <noregret> the page ust reloads
[01:07:03] <noregret> just*
[01:14:42] <beachandbytes> $('*').bind('keyup', function(event) {   alert($(event.srcElement).attr("id"));});
[01:14:54] <beachandbytes> try that noregret should tell you which item if it has an id
[01:15:27] <beachandbytes> you can catch keypress event and event.preventDefault
[01:15:57] <noregret> beachandbytes: the thins i'm facing is taht i have a keyup event on the field, so when pressing enter, it goes thru that event AND POSTs afterwards
[01:16:05] <noregret> i don't want it to POST, any ideas ?
[01:16:41] <noregret> beachandbytes: https://pastee.org/gfavu
[01:16:43] <noregret> that's what i got
[01:18:17] <defaultro> hey guys, i made a loop that displays <div></div> 30 times then I assigned draggable and droppable event to it. It's working. However, the first div when I drag it is underneath the other divs. How can I make a div the topmost once it gets focus?
[01:19:38] <beachandbytes> that should work
[01:19:47] <beachandbytes> defaultro any example code?
[01:20:07] <defaultro> it's a simple for loop in php that echo <div>
[01:20:20] <defaultro> one sec since it's on another machine
[01:20:43] <noregret> beachandbytes: it is working, but after it executes whatever is in the event, it does a POST to the same page
[01:21:03] <beachandbytes> do you have a submit button?
[01:22:32] <noregret> beachandbytes: no, it's only a <input class="eList" type="text" title="Email(s)..." name="emailList"> without a form even
[01:22:44] <defaultro> beachandbytes, http://pastebin.com/vSWR4pnK
[01:26:01] <beachandbytes> gotta be something else noregret what browser?
[01:26:35] <noregret> beachandbytes: FF 15
[01:27:23] <defaultro> beachandbytes, did you see my code?
[01:27:55] <defaultro> what will i add so that a div that I start dragging will be the topmost?
[01:28:19] <beachandbytes> yes defaultro
[01:28:34] <beachandbytes> can you js fiddle the issue noregret
[01:30:13] <beachandbytes> defaultro .draggable({ stack:
[01:31:32] <defaultro> ok, searching for stack, not familiar with it
[01:31:35] <defaultro> :)
[01:32:51] <defaultro> what value should I put in stack?
[01:42:24] <taha>   Ø§Ù„Ø³Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù… Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙƒÙ…
[01:43:07] <onats> hi guys
[01:43:20] <onats> do a lot of people still support IE devlopent
[01:43:22] <onats> development
[01:44:03] <beachandbytes> depends on the development
[01:44:06] <beachandbytes> internal site probably not
[01:44:31] <defaultro> i got it working
[01:44:39] <defaultro> stack: 'div' :D
[01:44:43] <defaultro> that is amazing
[01:44:47] <beachandbytes> oops sorry
[01:44:53] <beachandbytes> meant to paste the whole thing
[01:44:57] <beachandbytes> stack: 'div'
[01:45:17] <beachandbytes> but you learn more anyway :)
[01:45:30] <defaultro> :D
[01:46:09] <defaultro> i can sleep now, it's almost 4am :D
[02:00:14] <SuRfDeMoN> hi, is it possible to slide divs like you can slide images ? anyone know a good tutorial on this ?
[02:09:21] <hooloovoo> SuRfDeMoN: should be exactly the same principle. just animate the position.
[02:41:52] <asdffg> Hello
[02:42:06] <asdffg> need some help with jquery autocomplete
[02:42:41] <lalalala> hi
[02:43:06] <lalalala> $("body").delegate("div", "mouseover", function(event) this throws the error Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'delegate'
[03:06:32] <izual> Hi, I am writing a library and I refer to the library object with the "this" keyword. Somewhere inside it I have a jquery statements $(selector).click(function() {... }), but the this keyword changes inside the function, how can I reference the object properties inside this piece of code?
[03:17:55] <noregret> I have <td><div this></div></td> and I want to add a td like so $(this).parent().after('<td></td>'); i only want to add only one td but in this case, if that statement is run several times (triggered by a click) i will have several tds, how can I have only one ? is there a fast way
[03:25:19] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone i have a messy function i would like to ask some advice on its this http://pastie.org/private/vvxleve7s4vl8iyavgorga it reloads some div contents and writes some classes to it
[03:25:45] <jarr0dsz> i wondered how i could improve it since i have almost identical code for when the page loads and when i reload the contents of the div
[03:28:23] <jarr0dsz> something like this is cleaner http://pastie.org/private/asbfdmht4jo0onwtx8ywq but i still have problem it reloads the whole div on every refresh
[03:29:39] <jarr0dsz> can one load + append in 1 line perhaps?
[03:31:04] <maieul> hi
[03:31:16] <maieul> I have a problem with the .click() event
[03:31:35] <maieul> someone can help me ?
[03:38:11] <maieul> is someone here ?
[03:43:44] <nFFF> maieul just ask your question...
[03:43:54] <zChris> nFFF, he just did?
[03:43:57] <zChris> He asked if someone was here
[03:43:58] <zChris> :D
[03:44:17] <maieul> ok I was waiting to a human :-)
[03:44:26] <maieul> so I have a form
[03:44:29] <nFFF> Theres over 826 people here, are you stupid?
[03:44:51] <maieul> nFFF: sometime there is noone actif, ever with 826
[03:44:57] <zChris> nFFF, all bots!
[03:45:02] <maieul> very nice welcome
[03:45:05] <maieul> so
[03:45:10] <maieul> I have a form
[03:45:27] <nFFF> izual, just assign the global 'this' to another variable, and then access it within your handler
[03:45:34] <maieul> I would like that after the form be submitted, one ajax block be reloaded
[03:46:01] <maieul> but I need the ajax reload be made after the data be send to the servor
[03:46:10] <maieul> because the ajax bloc uses them
[03:46:14] <maieul> is it clear ?
[03:47:07] <zChris> cant you use the "success:" function of a ajax call?
[03:47:34] <maieul> heu
[03:47:46] <maieul> don't know
[03:47:50] <maieul> I use ajaxreload
[03:48:07] <maieul> which (I think) is a function of my CMS
[03:48:53] <maieul> zChris: if I could, what should I do ?
[03:50:17] <zChris> maieul, not sure, perhaps you can read about something here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[03:50:40] <maieul> actually, I have this code http://spip.pastebin.fr/24457
[03:51:14] <maieul> hum
[03:51:41] <maieul> but the problem is that the sucess option is after the ajax request
[03:52:25] <maieul> but my need is to wait the submission, which is not ajaxed before reload ajax blcok
[03:52:59] <zChris> maieul, well i cant help you sozzy :<
[03:53:14] <maieul> zChris: ok, thnak
[03:54:49] <nFFF> maieul, you'll need to submit the form using ajax, and within the success callback, ajaxReload();
[03:55:08] <maieul> a !
[03:55:31] <maieul> I will try, because the submission of form with ajax use an API of form of my CMS
[03:55:45] <nFFF> you have no other option
[03:56:03] <nFFF> becuase you won't know if the form has succesfully been submitted without recieving data back from the server
[04:01:12] <lucasw> Hi, ive got a hosted version of jquery from code.jquery.com and that one is giving me an error on this line: (723) length = elems.length,
[04:01:15] <lucasw> anyone got any clue?
[04:02:26] <zChris> lucasw, what is the error?
[04:06:08] <MacroMan> Is it possible to animate to max-height: none;? -> http://jsfiddle.net/DHfqr/
[04:08:31] <maieul> thanks nFFF it's working http://spip.pastebin.fr/24458
[04:09:58] <AdamPDotty> Guest: maybe maxheight: 0; ?
[04:10:01] <lucasw> zChris: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[04:10:01] <AdamPDotty> -
[04:11:15] <maieul> bon
[04:11:17] <maieul> ++
[04:13:06] <lucasw> my biggest concern is that my code works like a charm on one subdomain but on the other i get the uncaught typeerror.
[04:18:52] <enoch> hi all
[04:20:20] <enoch> http://pastebin.com/TuWCbrpV i have 4 off-secondi but, why is it working only with the first element?
[04:22:09] <enoch> ...
[04:22:37] <truedon> Hey guys, how can I time the duration something has been happening in my script?
[04:23:01] <truedon> like start a timer then retrieve its value, and pause or reset it based on events
[04:23:23] <anli_> I am running div.css('opacitydiv.animate({opacity: 0.8}, 200);
[04:23:27] <blackspotwiggins> truedon, record timestamps and do arithmetic on them
[04:23:29] <anli_> oops
[04:24:08] <truedon> blackspotwiggins:  thanks, yeh probably less intensive
[04:24:10] <truedon> nice one :)
[04:24:14] <anli_> I am running div.css('opacity, 0); div.animate({opacity: 0.8}, 200);  , that will nicely fade a white overlay, the 2nd time I run this code, I only get opacity 1 without fade, why?
[04:25:17] <seutje> Guest15651: http://jsfiddle.net/DHfqr/5/ like that?
[04:25:41] <anli_> I think I found the error, elsewhere as usual
[04:26:03] <truedon> blackspotwiggins:  like new Date.getTime(); or is there a jQuery function thats better?
[04:27:42] <blackspotwiggins> truedon, thats fine
[04:30:48] <Guest15651> seutje: Wow, perfect, thank you so much.
[04:31:12] <Guest15651> What's happened to my name?
[04:31:21] <seutje> Guest15651: np, hope the comments are descriptive enough, lemme know if you want more clarification
[04:31:31] <seutje> Guest15651: you took too long to identify with nickserv
[04:31:56] <Guest15651> seutje: Hmm, odd. I had irssi set to automatically log me in.
[04:32:12] <Guest15651> seutje: I understand the code though, so thank you
[04:33:04] <Guest15651> Is there a reason that you've not used javascript:void(0); in the href?
[04:33:41] <Guest15651> I notice that you've done e.preventDefault(); to stop the link going anywhere, just wondering if there is any advantage?
[04:34:07] <seutje> Guest15651: I prefer to do that within the handler
[04:34:15] <Guest15651> So just personal preference.
[04:34:27] <seutje> Guest15651: but technically, I'd have the link be created with JS, as it doesn't serve a purpose if JS is off
[04:34:41] <seutje> Guest15651: but then u'd sort need to redo the CSS as well, as it would be forever collapsed
[04:35:11] <MacroMan_> In my actual code, the link is hidden until the page is loaded, so there isn't worry about that.
[04:57:17] <MacroMan_> Is there an event for when the page is entirely loaded (including images)? I'm having problems with $(document)(ready(function(){}); running before images are loaded.
[04:57:43] <MacroMan_> '(ready' was meant to be '.ready'.
[04:58:27] <BalmTiger> does anybody now a cross-browser way to print a pdf file using query?
[04:58:38] <BalmTiger> just calling the print dialog
[04:58:56] <MacroMan_> Ah, never mind. .load()
[05:01:23] <BalmTiger> I didn't know printing a pdf is so hard..
[05:06:36] <anli_> Can I specify both start and stop values in .animate?
[05:07:12] <seutje> anli_: just set and then animate
[05:07:48] <seutje> like $foo.css('height', '100px').animate({'height': '200px'});
[05:16:19] <noregret> I have <td><div this></div></td> and I want to add a td like so $(this).parent().after('<td></td>'); i only want to add only one td but in this case, if that statement is run several times (triggered by a click) i will have several tds, how can I have only one ? is there a fast way
[05:17:11] <Cork> noregret: you would have to check if it exists, and if it does, do nothing
[05:17:33] <Jon47> just like $.extend is sort of a hash "union" method, is there a hash intersect method also built into jquery?
[05:17:46] <seutje> noregret: or use one()
[05:18:10] <noregret> seutje: what's that ?
[05:18:16] <seutje> ?one & noregret
[05:18:19] <bot-t> seutje, Couldn't find "one & noregret" in jQuery Docs.
[05:18:22] <Zogot> Isn't it once?
[05:18:29] <seutje> ?one @ noregret
[05:18:30] <bot-t> noregret, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[05:18:49] <Zogot> stand corrected :p
[05:18:57] <seutje> once is a plugin that adds a class and trims the collection to those that don't already have that class
[05:19:02] <Cork> Jon47: no, not provided by jquery
[05:19:10] <seutje> ?once
[05:19:11] <bot-t> seutje, .one() - Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[05:19:14] <Jon47> Cork, ok, thanks
[05:19:40] <seutje> Zogot: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/once
[05:23:51] <noregret> how can i check if the next element matches another element ?
[05:27:19] <xen> hi
[05:28:06] <xen> help, when I upload my html file that contains javascript/jquery, all of the js/jquery is placed on one line and everything stops working
[05:28:28] <xen> does anyone have any idea why this is happening? this is ridiculous, I've never had anything like this happen
[05:28:52] <xen> it works on my localhost, but when I upload to my live host, it stops working.
[05:29:47] <AdvoWork> say if i've got an href link, which i'm assigning an event too, can i have it so the link works as normal(opens a pdf) but also fires a function call for something?
[05:32:14] <xen> any idea why carriage returns aren't recognised on my web host?
[05:32:24] <xen> all my code is on one line when I upload it to the server
[05:33:39] <seutje> xen: you host prolly doesn't use carriage returns
[05:34:43] <Pymous> Hello ! I'm trying to retrieve some JSON from an Ajax request, what should I use to do that properly ?
[05:35:41] <xen> what do you mean?
[05:35:55] <xen> I have other files on the host
[05:36:01] <Pymous> I will give you a pastebin, just a sec :)
[05:36:31] <xen> seutje: I have other files on the host, and those files run perfectly
[05:36:56] <Pymous> xen > Here is the pastebin : http://pastebin.com/0Ri2HrQb
[05:37:00] <xen> seutje: this file on the other hand, has it's carriage returns removed, and the whole javascript is broken
[05:37:28] <seutje> xen: I dunno, but most hosts run on unix systems and they don't recognize carriage returns, only line feeds
[05:38:02] <seutje> but I don't think that should matter if you set the charset to UTF-8
[05:38:06] <xen> I just don't understand how my files work perfectly on my localhost
[05:38:19] <xen> I've tried both UTF-8 and ANSi
[05:38:31] <xen> and no change
[05:38:46] <noregret> i got html in var content; how can i use that content to open a dialog ? should i write that content to the page ?
[05:38:55] <xen> because of this problem, the javascript/jquery doesn't work
[05:39:07] <xen> and the whole page is not working
[05:39:14] <seutje> Pymous: don't write json manually, build a regular object/array and json encode it
[05:39:18] <seutje> ?g php json encode
[05:39:19] <bot-t> seutje, PHP: json_encode - Manual - http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[05:39:22] <xen> ...
[05:39:57] <seutje> xen: is it publicly accessible?
[05:40:37] <xen> yes
[05:40:38] <Jon47> is it ok to bind events to the $(document) ?  I see the .on examples on the jquery api webpage use $("body") instead...
[05:40:47] <xen> seutje: http://themetumbler.com/design/
[05:40:51] <xen> check it out.
[05:41:15] <xen> it's a basic html+javascript, it works perfectly on my localhost, but when uploaded to this web server, it stop's working
[05:41:49] <__null> make it a jsfiddle
[05:41:49] <seutje> xen: the entire page is on a single line, not just *a* js file
[05:42:09] <xen> ok
[05:42:12] <xen> that's even worse
[05:42:19] <xen> why does that happen?
[05:42:35] <xen> you can image I didn't code this on one line, that would be ridiculous
[05:42:46] <xen> everything is organised in my editor
[05:42:59] <seutje> xen: response header doesn't contain a charset
[05:43:20] <seutje> xen: I'd say your HTTP daemon isn't set up properly
[05:43:34] <xen> ?
[05:44:04] <xen> you mean it's a server problem?
[05:44:26] <seutje> afaict
[05:44:39] <xen> seutje: I don't think the problem is from the server, because:
[05:44:41] <xen> seutje: http://themetumbler.com
[05:44:51] <xen> seutje: this wordpress install works perfectly
[05:44:58] <xen> on the same server
[05:45:16] <seutje> that page does have a charset set in the response header
[05:45:37] <seutje> I dunno, does WP require you to set the charset for every page or something?
[05:46:13] <xen> nop
[05:46:20] <xen> wait, it works now
[05:46:37] <xen> I just copied the code from the old index, and just clicked new file
[05:46:39] <xen> pasted it in
[05:46:47] <xen> saved, uploaded the new file, and now it works
[05:46:54] <seutje> odd, still no charset
[05:47:04] <seutje> does ur htaccess define a default charset?
[05:47:33] <noregret> i got html in var content; how can i use that content to open a dialog ? should i write that content to the page ?
[05:47:33] <xen> no
[05:48:32] <seutje> xen: it's good practice to have a default specified iirc
[05:49:03] <xen> ok, I'll modify
[05:49:12] <xen> define*
[05:49:23] <pachet> noregret: by dialog do you mean a modal overlay?
[05:49:29] <xen> why is it better in UTF-8 that ANSI ?
[05:49:35] <Wolf_22> I have a form with some radio buttons. 2 of these have particular values I would like to apply logic to if and only if one of them is checked. I think I know how to loop over each radio but I'm having a hard time applying the logic for both names and whether one of them is checked... How can I do this?
[05:50:02] <Cork> xen: better in UTF-8 that ANSI?
[05:50:09] <pachet> xen: im jumping in in the middle of the conversation, but utf-8 plays better with most server configurations ootb
[05:50:19] <noregret> pachet: dialog() from jquery-ui
[05:50:56] <Cork> pachet, xen: utf-8 can express most languages on the planet, while ansi only supports english
[05:51:18] <seutje> xen: ANSI isn't a UTF standard
[05:51:29] <xen> ok, thanks both of you
[05:51:33] <xen> all 3
[05:51:36] <xen> :P
[05:51:42] <pachet> noregret: oh i see
[05:51:46] <seutje> only reason it's common is because a lot of ppl don't change it when saving from notepad :P
[05:52:00] <pachet> noregret: i think you can just do $(myVarWithHtml).dialog()
[05:52:20] <Cork> really everything published for the web should be in utf8
[05:52:32] <Cork> except for the few languages it dose't support that is
[05:52:34] <pachet> noregret: if you want to reuse it, probably better to do something like var $dialog = $(myVarWithHtml).dialog({autoOpen:false}).dialog('open')
[05:53:22] <xen> has anybody worked with jquery masonry ?
[05:54:05] <xen> I want to make jquery masonry stack the divs vertically first, and then move to the next column
[05:54:39] <xen> currently, masonry places the in a horizontal sequence
[05:55:04] <xen> and that's not really good if you want to organise them by date or other things
[05:55:24] <dwt> Good morning! I'm looking for a way to attach events (click) to ::after or ::before elements.
[05:55:53] <javalover> hey guys quick question
[05:56:03] <dwt> My browser just explodes on syntax like this:  $('.navigation-button:after');
[05:56:08] <Pymous> dwt > sibblings ?
[05:56:10] <javalover> if I put function myfunction(){var helloworld = "hi";}
[05:56:12] <dwt> and googling doesn't seem to bring anything up
[05:56:20] <javalover> is that scope not reachable outside of myfunction?
[05:56:33] <Pymous> Yes javalover
[05:56:37] <dwt> @Pymous: good idea, I'll check that
[05:56:39] <javalover> ok good good
[05:56:48] <javalover> idk why I ask it's just javascript does some funny stuff
[05:57:00] <javalover> so just making sure atleast that it follows scope
[05:57:11] <Pymous> People does some funny stuff :P
[05:57:14] <Pymous> Better be sure !
[05:58:12] <seutje> dwt: you can't select pseudo-elements with sizzle
[05:59:53] <dwt> seutje: oh damn.
[05:59:57] <dwt> well then it's another solution.
[05:59:59] <dwt> many thanks!
[06:00:16] <seutje> dwt: afaik, you can't manipulate those with any javascript API
[06:00:53] <seutje> (other than dropping in a style block with some !important sprinkles :P)
[06:01:34] <javalover> i have another question that is completely off topic but...
[06:01:49] <javalover> in order to get my browser to work, I have to ipconfig/release  renew  it's the only way
[06:01:57] <seutje> javalover: note that the scope is limited to where the function was *defined*, not where it was executed
[06:02:00] <javalover> any idea how to fix this i'm on windows xp
[06:02:07] <pachet> step 1: lose windows xp
[06:02:10] <javalover> lol
[06:02:19] <seutje> javalover: you probably only need to flush your DNS settings
[06:02:27] <seutje> javalover: so ipconfig /flushdns should do
[06:02:30] <javalover> i did that though
[06:02:42] <javalover> I have a serious issue here lol
[06:02:59] <seutje> I assume ur trying to set up a site locally with a virtualhost or something, right?
[06:03:16] <dwt> seutje: hm, well, at least know I know what I'm at.
[06:03:21] <dwt> Thanks again
[06:03:40] <javalover> well that's the other thing a while ago I did exactly what you're saying
[06:03:48] <javalover> but it was for a company & they made me change a file
[06:03:57] <javalover> but i forgot what that file is called....
[06:04:04] <javalover> it makes it so php loads on your system
[06:04:36] <pachet> :[
[06:04:39] <seutje> apache.conf?
[06:04:47] <javalover> perhaps
[06:04:49] <javalover> it's some config file
[06:04:57] <seutje> suppose that's where you would turn php module on/off
[06:05:39] <dean[w]> I have a peculiar issue, test-case here: http://jsfiddle.net/dMzsE/. Why is it when I drag the element over the droppable area but dont let go, the container is increased in size (as per the css) but the font itself doesnt increase in size until i drop?
[06:05:53] <dean[w]> +10 internet points for whomever can figure this oddity out :/
[06:06:27] <dean[w]> It's almost as if the rendering engine goes "Let's increase the container ready to increase the font-size, but then it never increases the font-size until you let go"
[06:07:35] <eip56> morning
[06:10:08] <themojowill> howdy
[06:12:07] <javalover> omg i think i fixed it
[06:12:27] <noregret> someone help please https://pastee.org/8t7zb when i open the dialog for the first time (by clicking on emailIcon), the form inside is submitted by ajax, but when i open the dialog for the second time, the form doesn't get submitted by ajax, meaning the form selector stopped selecting, any ideas why ?
[06:12:29] <javalover> wow ok so
[06:12:40] <javalover> I had inside system32/etc/hosts
[06:12:47] <javalover> I found "null null" at the bottom
[06:12:52] <javalover> deleted that saved it and now internet works agian
[06:12:55] <javalover> holy shietttttttttttt
[06:13:49] <themojowill> Is there a way to add a scale to a jQuery UI slider? IE showing the scale underneath the slider? (Other than just sticking in an image or something)
[06:13:52] <javalover> OH and my function is working DOUBLE PWNED!
[06:20:53] <Cork> themojowill: no, you would have to do that your self
[06:21:05] <Cork> themojowill: its fairly easy to do though
[06:21:18] <Cork> (without an image)
[06:21:48] <themojowill> Cork: I tried by marking at left: 10% - left: 100% etc but just did't sit right
[06:22:08] <Cork> set a left margin of half the element width
[06:22:12] <Cork> (negative()
[06:22:20] <eip56> So I know the jQuery plugins page has been down for some time now. Any expectations on when it would be back up? Second question everyone's favorite subject form validation. Can anyone suggest a good plugin.
[06:22:54] <themojowill> Cork: I am not setting setting the element width it is 100%
[06:23:29] <Cork> themojowill: add an element thats the same width as the slider
[06:23:40] <Cork> themojowill: set that element to position: relative;
[06:23:58] <Cork> the add elements inside it (position absolute) and left: 10%, 20% and so on
[06:24:15] <Cork> with a margin-left: - ½ the element width
[06:24:21] <Cork> and it should aline just fine
[06:24:29] <Cork> *align
[06:25:11] <Cork> eip56: the plugin page was exposed to lots of spam, so it was taken down; not sure when its planed to go up again
[06:25:17] <Cork> but it will prob take some time
[06:25:29] <Cork> eip56: there might be a bug on the bugtracker about it, check there
[06:25:34] <themojowill> Cork: Thanks I'll have a go
[06:26:45] <eip56> What about a  suggestion for a nice plugin for form validation? or do you prefer custom code
[06:27:19] <Cork> i always write my own, but formvalidator is quite common
[06:27:51] <themojowill> Cork: I don't understand what you said about a left-margin 1/2 the element width?
[06:27:56] <noregret> someone help please https://pastee.org/8t7zb when i open the dialog for the first time (by clicking on emailIcon), the form inside is submitted by ajax, but when i open the dialog for the second time, the form doesn't get submitted by ajax, meaning the form selector stopped selecting, any ideas why ?
[06:29:03] <Cork> themojowill: <span style="position: absolute; text-align: center; width: 50px; margin-left: -25px; left: 20%>20%</span>
[06:29:41] <Cork> eip56: give http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ a try
[06:30:13] <Wolf_22> I have an "each loop function" which keeps looping... How can I break out of this? With return? (I tried return and it doesn't seem to do the trick.) Basically, I'm just trying to loop through each radio I have for a particular value of only 2 of the radios.
[06:30:45] <Cork> Wolf_22: your talking about .each of for each, or for in or what?
[06:31:09] <Wolf_22> $("form_name").each(function(){
[06:31:39] <rmurphey> Wolf_22: is $('form_name') selecting anything?
[06:31:59] <rmurphey> and if so, what?
[06:32:21] <Cork> Wolf_22: if you want to break an .each loop use "return false;"
[06:32:56] <Wolf_22> Cork: Inside that loop, it's doing this: $(":radio[value=value_name_from_radio_markup_attribute]").click(function(){ -- and then it applies some logic (or at least, I'm trying to make it apply logic. Ha.)
[06:33:32] <Cork> Wolf_22: most of the time your thinking about the code the wrong way if your adding click events inside a loop
[06:33:56] <Cork> there is a few edge cases where its needed, but most of the time you should just add one generic event listener insteaad
[06:33:56] <Wolf_22> Cork: In any event, that "return false" seems to have worked.
[06:34:18] <Cork> Wolf_22: return false is the wrong thing to do in an event listener
[06:34:24] <Cork> and that has nothing to do with each
[06:34:38] <Cork> you want event.preventDefault(); in event listeners
[06:34:48] <Cork> or stopPropagation()
[06:35:32] <noregret> https://pastee.org/8t7zb when i open the dialog for the first time (by clicking on emailIcon), the form inside is submitted by ajax, but when i open the dialog for the second time, the form doesn't get submitted by ajax, meaning the form selector stopped selecting, any ideas why ?
[06:35:57] <Qdest> If I've got multiple .classes, and I would like to see if any of them has a width over X px, how could I do stuff to that one which does? E.g. one has a width of 200px, do nothing, the other is above 200px so increase padding.. ?
[06:36:17] <anli_> When I reload a form with file upload having multiple="multiple", the filename(s) is not removed from the <input type="file", why?
[06:37:58] <noregret> i tried it as https://pastee.org/t2ffy but the same issue
[06:38:36] <Qdest> I'm using a each() to count the occurences of .class like :: jQuery.each( jQuery(".class"), function() { console.log( jQuery(this).outerWidth() ); }); But I'm not really sure how to append changes to the one that meets the requirement, e.g. above 200px or so width
[06:38:58] <Cork> noregret: most likely cause your not removing the old content from the page when your done
[06:39:15] <Cork> noregret: so your $('#DpanEmailform') finds the old element not your new one
[06:40:04] <noregret> Cork: what should i do in this case ?
[06:40:22] <Cork> Qdest: $('.my_class').filter(function() { return $(this).outerWidth() == 1000; }).addClass('found')
[06:40:42] <noregret> Cork: and which is the best method for that, first paste or second
[06:40:44] <Cork> noregret: bind a close event on the dialog, when it closes remove all related elements
[06:40:59] <Cork> ?p @ noregret
[06:41:01] <bot-t> noregret, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:41:09] <noregret> Cork: you mean content = "" ?
[06:41:17] <Cork> ?.empty
[06:41:18] <bot-t> .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[06:41:23] <Qdest> Cork: oooh, nice. Does that mean it'd apply ".found" for all classes of .my_class that equals a width of 1000?
[06:41:24] <Cork> content = "" won't help
[06:41:36] <themojowill> Cork: Thanks matey got it working
[06:41:38] <Cork> that only empties the content string valiable
[06:41:38] <noregret> Cork: yeah, i meant empty the content var is what i meant
[06:41:47] <Cork> thats not what you need
[06:41:54] <Cork> you need to remove the dom from the page
[06:41:58] <Cork> not the unparsed html
[06:42:02] <mazzachre> What will be run first? <head><script ...>$(function() {$('something).something();});</script> or <body>...<script...>$('something').something();</script> ?
[06:42:14] <Cork> mazzachre: head
[06:42:15] <noregret> Cork: ah, so #emailDiag.remove()
[06:42:24] <Cork> noregret: kinda, but yes
[06:43:05] <noregret> Cork: and i was asking about which the better method, https://pastee.org/8t7zb or https://pastee.org/t2ffy
[06:43:43] <Cork> noregret: depends
[06:44:04] <Cork> noregret: the first one runs the ajax directly as your code runs
[06:44:16] <Cork> the second runs the ajaxForm when the dialog is shown
[06:44:45] <noregret> hmm
[06:44:48] <Cork> noregret: and really, if you want to show the same form over and over again, you should really make it static inline html
[06:44:58] <Cork> then you can simplify your code a lot
[06:45:16] <Qdest> Cork: So, jQuery('.my_class').filter(function() { return jQuery(this).outerWidth() > 200; }).addClass('found'); <-- how would I be able to add the class to .closest('.my_wrapper') ?
[06:45:17] <noregret> Cork:  you mean add it to the dom instead of the content var ?
[06:46:09] <Cork> Cork: So, jQuery('.my_class').filter(function() { return jQuery(this).outerWidth() > 200; }).each(function() { $(this).closest('.my_wrapper') })
[06:46:31] <Cork> noregret: i mean add it statically in the html as a hidden div
[06:46:38] <Cork> and just do $(
[06:46:52] <Cork> and just do $('#SpamEmailForm').dialog('show')
[06:47:04] <Qdest> Cork: If I would simply just attach it, like: ...> 200; }).closest('.my_wrapper').addClass('found'); what would that mean?
[06:47:18] <noregret> Cork: well, as you notice, that depends on teh clicked element, so that won't do, it has some variables
[06:47:29] <Cork> Qdest: you can, but that will only find the first occurrence
[06:47:49] <Qdest> Aha, thank you. A lot! :)
[06:47:56] <Cork> noregret: i don't see ow that makes it impossible
[06:48:32] <Cork> noregret: you just need to set the input fields value before you show the dialog
[06:50:53] <iwtu> hi. is possible find out witch selector triggered the event in case you have multiple selector?
[06:52:05] <pachet> not unless you explicitly associate that selector with particular elements
[06:52:12] <pachet> jquery doesn't expose that, in other words
[06:53:38] <Cork> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/z3yd7/1/
[06:53:48] <PBDev> hello
[06:54:10] <PBDev> I have used nivo slider with rectangle for text
[06:54:50] <noregret> Cork: cool, thanks
[06:55:23] <PBDev> I used the slide up and down function, to make the text in the rectangle move down from the page
[06:55:32] <PBDev> but when a new image slide is loaded
[06:55:41] <PBDev> the slide up and down status is lost
[06:55:55] <PBDev> causing to to move up when it shouldn't
[06:56:53] <Cork> pachet: its accessable to plugins so you could create a simple plugin that exposes it to you
[07:00:07] <granden> Hello guys, been searching a round like an idiot for an tag cloud plugin for jquery. One that creates some nice shapes. Not an exact figure but some abstract shape. Not only list the tags in different font size. Anyone know of a good plugin that you could recommend?
[07:00:25] <Cork> PBDev: thats prob cause the event listeners are added directly to the existing elements, so they need to be readded each time an element is added to the page
[07:00:52] <Cork> PBDev: that can be fixed by using delegated event listeners if you do it your self, or you would have to rerun the selector your self
[07:01:14] <XOXO1> I want to use jquery ui autocomplete to users can specify their skills, I'd like to get similar look: http://d2o0t5hpnwv4c1.cloudfront.net/618_jqueryAutocomplete/img1.jpg how can I get this "x" to an entry in order to remove it easily?
[07:01:31] <PBDev> how do I used delegated event listeners?
[07:01:43] <_zoggy_> XOXO1, thats in a demo...
[07:02:07] <noregret> Cork:  is ther a reason for name var's with a $ ?
[07:02:37] <_zoggy_> oh, choosen does that.. XOXO1: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[07:02:44] <Cork> noregret: no
[07:03:00] <Cork> noregret: its a variable name just like any other
[07:03:23] <XOXO1> _zoggy_: thanks
[07:03:27] <BoF> buenas tardes
[07:03:31] <Cork> noregret: its a way to identify if the content is a jquery object, but its just if you like doing it that way
[07:04:20] <iwtu> pachet: thanks
[07:09:28] <mazzachre> Cork: OK thx, even when it is packed into the document ready function? Will inline scripts not be run when they are reached, before the document is completely ready?
[07:09:47] <Cork> no
[07:09:57] <mazzachre> ok, thx
[07:10:16] <Cork> ready is just a wrapper to listen for DOMContentLoad combined with a fallback to load if it doesn't exist
[07:10:30] <Cork> its just an event the browser sends when its done parsing the original html
[07:10:48] <mazzachre> OK, and then the browser will execute inline scripts after that?
[07:10:52] <Cork> ?g mdn DOMContentLoad
[07:10:54] <bot-t> Cork, DOMContentLoaded | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_event_reference/DOMContentLoaded
[07:11:12] <Cork> mazzachre: no inline scripts executes when the parser gets to them
[07:11:56] <Cork> mazzachre: so inline scripts might execute long before the dom is stable
[07:12:03] <Cork> depending on how big the html file is
[07:12:08] <themojowill> I am creating a price slider using jQuery UI slider, I have the sliders all setup and working great thanks to Cork what I want is to show a visual representation of the items picked on the slider, So if the user selects 5 racks 5 little images of racks are shown?
[07:12:18] <PBDev> so how do I transfer the state from one slide to the next in jquery nivoslider?
[07:12:35] <mazzachre> Cork: OK, so the inline scripts may be run before document.ready? Or how? I don't quite get it, lol
[07:12:42] <PBDev> I am losing the status which I assgined to up or down, when the next slide is clicked
[07:13:36] <Cork> mazzachre: 1. url entered in the url bar; 2. the browser fetches the original html resource; 3. the browser starts to parse the head element and runs the script tags each at a time
[07:13:55] <Cork> 4. what all the script tags in head is run and done it starts parsing the body element
[07:14:20] <Cork> 5. if the parser founds a script tag it hands the content over to the js engine and continues
[07:14:43] <Cork> 6. when the parser hits </body> and has done all the error corrections it fires DOMContentLoaded
[07:15:09] <Cork> 7. when all external dependencies (img, video and so on) has loaded the browser fires the load event
[07:15:17] <Cork> mazzachre: thats the flow
[07:15:53] <Cork> what the script tags == when the script tags
[07:15:55] <mazzachre> Cork: Yes, I understand the flow, what I am unsecure about is the contents of the document.ready handler, if it will be run before or after any inline scripts are encountered?
[07:16:09] <anli_> Is there a way to get current progress on a $.ajax operation? (number of bytes sent)
[07:16:13] <Cork> mazzachre: check 5 and 6
[07:16:31] <Cork> mazzachre: ready is DOMContentLoaded or load
[07:16:39] <Cork> mazzachre: inline scripts is line 5
[07:16:40] <mazzachre> ok, thx
[07:16:58] <Cork> so yes inline scripts will always run before ready
[07:17:28] <PBDev> okay so, how can I transfer the value of a variable from one jquery file to another? I need something kinda like $_POST
[07:17:39] <PBDev> anyone know?
[07:18:12] <Cork> PBDev: js have sense of "file"
[07:18:16] <retro|cz> Eviltwin, my version if you're interested - http://jsfiddle.net/retro/Xs7w2/4/
[07:18:16] <Cork> its scope
[07:18:26] <NoiseEee> PBDev: you could put it in window/global scope
[07:18:27] <PBDev> ?
[07:18:35] <Cork> PBDev: as long as the different sections have access to the same scope, what file its in doesn't matter
[07:18:48] <NoiseEee> window.thingForAllJSToUse = 'jesus';
[07:18:49] <retro|cz> Eviltwin, sorry, this http://jsfiddle.net/retro/Xs7w2/5/
[07:19:26] <mazzachre> PBDev: Yuo can also use stuff like $.data() to handle data that is element relevant
[07:19:34] <PBDev> but, what is happening is, when I click down, and then change the slide, the rectangular textbox remains down.. So I either need to reset the state so it is in the up poistion again
[07:20:00] <PBDev> or transfer the last position, after the slide is changed so it doesn't go further up
[07:20:14] <Cork> PBDev: that you prob have a class on the element or something and THATS what you need to reset
[07:20:25] <Cork> *that means you prob
[07:20:57] <PBDev> I do have something like $('.nivoSlider').bind('click', function () {...
[07:21:04] <PBDev> how do I reset it?
[07:21:11] <Cork> you don't reset it
[07:21:16] <Cork> thats just an event listener
[07:21:39] <Cork> it triggeres every time someone clicks the elements found by the $('.nivoSlider') selector
[07:22:00] <Cork> it has no concept of state
[07:22:16] <anli_> Do I need to get access to the xhr object to get file upload progress like this?: http://anders.dev.100procent.com/img/37_1e56aa.jpg
[07:22:20] <PBDev> this is all within, $(document).ready(function(){...
[07:22:27] <Cork> doens't matter
[07:32:52] <themojowill> I am creating a price slider using jQuery UI slider, I have the sliders all setup and working great thanks to Cork what I want is to show a visual representation of the items picked on the slider, So if the user selects 5 racks 5 little images of racks are shown?

[08:07:17] <hemangpatel> any live example ?
[08:07:49] <pachet> uh
[08:08:36] <themojowill> I am creating a price slider using jQuery UI slider, I have the sliders all setup and working great thanks to Cork what I want is to show a visual representation of the items picked on the slider, So if the user selects 5 racks 5 little images of racks are shown?
[08:35:13] <sjeijk> hi all, using ST2 and really miss drag an image and appear as code.. so if you also want that pls vote for it here http://sublimetext.userecho.com/topic/50583-drag-images-into-editor-to-insert-path-or-img-tag/
[08:35:38] <zsoc> i know i'm really far off here, but i'm not even quite sure where to start. It should be self explanity what i'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/hsVDc/4/
[08:38:30] <zsoc> hm ok so at least i'm checking val now.... if ($("select option:selected").val() ... still think i'm far off
[08:38:52] <ngharo> zsoc: if ($(this).val() == 'FL') { ... }
[08:39:16] <zsoc> ngharo, does $(this) work because it's in the context of the .change bind?
[08:39:49] <ngharo> right, this refers to whatever your selector $(".select-inner select") is working on
[08:40:32] <ngharo> or rather whichever element the .change() event fired on
[08:40:46] <zsoc> ngharo, ok cool, still can't get an alert to fire tho lol
[08:40:49] <zsoc> http://jsfiddle.net/hsVDc/7/
[08:41:09] <ngharo> you need to select jquery on the left, where it says "Choose Framework"
[08:41:22] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/hsVDc/8/
[08:41:42] <zsoc> oh, jsfiddle fail, lol, thank you :)
[08:41:49] <ngharo> np
[08:42:01] <zsoc> perfect, thank you. Now I just have to get what i need to do to work after it's selected :p
[08:43:06] <BillyJoe> This works fine in ff and chrome: http://labs.funkhausdesign.com/examples/img-svg/img-to-svg.html
[08:43:15] <BillyJoe> Anyone know how I can make it work for IE 9?
[08:44:26] <Whirl3d> Do I need to use jquery to handle a situation where I have a css3 transition that fades an element out, then changes it's text and fades it back in? Or is there some css3 goodness I should use?
[08:45:58] <zsoc> Whirl3d: sounds like a good canidate for jquery
[08:46:04] <_zoggy_> css3 is only going to work for a small subset of browsers
[08:46:16] <_zoggy_> shoud just use jquery .hide/show
[08:47:51] <Whirl3d> I'm happy with a lack of "fading" in and out for non-css3 compliant browsers (which is actually smaller than you might think)
[08:48:35] <Whirl3d> Just not sure how to compensate for the delay. I'll ask #css and fall back to jquery. Thanks for input, _zoggy_
[08:56:40] <Whirl3d> in Jquery, how do you determine whether it is better to make an abstract button class that updates a text field with it's "descr" if available or should the responsibility lie on the shoulders of the "menu" class?
[08:57:43] <pbase> Is it a known issue with jquery-ui datepicker that it doesnot stick to the input field on rendering a page? I have a page which list orderitems <each in its own <div> >. using ajax, i render a date field (datepicker type)in each div. but when i click on the fields, the datefields are misplaced.. is this a known problem? my fields are rendered cleanly on a plain html page with the same css.. any suggestions?
[08:58:28] <Whirl3d> In other words, I can setup the behavior that whenever an anchor of class "btn" is rolled over, it should update a text field with it's embedded data.descr (if available) or blank a text field if not....or
[08:58:50] <zsoc> ugh, why would something work in jsfiddle and not on my site, i don't like that
[08:59:24] <ryanneufeld> zsoc: check the css reset, I've personally found that one threw me off
[08:59:49] <zsoc> css reset? no css
[09:00:44] <zsoc> Im populating a select field with ajax, so when the page loads, technically, the select/options aren't there. Could that be making my binding (.change) fail?
[09:02:15] <pbase> zsoc: they are json objects
[09:02:37] <zsoc> pbase, Im sorry, what is a json object in this context?
[09:04:04] <pbase> zsoc - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750122/filtering-dropdown-menus-with-ajax-and-php
[09:04:32] <pbase> you might not be using php, but still the concept remains the same
[09:05:10] <zsoc> pbase, i am using php, i'm just confused. the ajax/jquery population is working fine. I guess what you're saying is I need to bind the selector on ajax success?
[09:05:44] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ zsoc
[09:05:44] <pbase> sorru i guess I need to know the problem you are facing again
[09:06:13] <zsoc> NoiseEee, yes i have that bookmarked, i shall go through it again
[09:07:36] <zsoc> pbase, I am selecting with $(".select-inner select").change(function () {... but I fear that because .select-inner doesn't exist on document load, that's why this isn't working. So I guess my answer is I need to bind after the ajax sends out to populate the dropdown
[09:08:17] <NoiseEee> zsoc: indeed.
[09:08:33] <zsoc> NoiseEee, can I cheat and just use .live?
[09:08:45] <NoiseEee> zsoc: no, but you may cheat and use .on
[09:09:31] <Heather_> Im looking at this plugin creation tutorial. What is fn in $.fn.pluginname?
[09:10:10] <ryanneufeld> ?live
[09:10:11] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[09:10:13] <zsoc> NoiseEee, oohhh.. so i set .on to a parent element and then sell it to bind .change to the child element that isn't in existence yet
[09:10:26] <ryanneufeld> live is an alias to .on
[09:10:40] <sunbeam> I would like each even number of tr to have the class even
[09:10:45] <sunbeam> and each other odd
[09:10:50] <sunbeam> any idea how i can best do this?
[09:11:01] <sunbeam> so first <tr class="odd">
[09:11:04] <sunbeam> second <tr class="even">
[09:11:05] <sunbeam> and so on
[09:11:06] <ryanneufeld> sunbeam: you can use pseudo classes in css
[09:11:16] <sunbeam> ryanneufeld: but also for even not even?
[09:11:40] <Heather_> in the beginning of the plugin there is function($) what does $ refer too ?
[09:11:41] <tw2113> nth-child('even')
[09:11:46] <tw2113> nth-child('odd')
[09:11:47] <sunbeam> tw2113: cool thanks
[09:11:48] <zsoc> oh, .live is depreciated, look at that
[09:11:55] <tw2113> if i recall
[09:12:03] <sunbeam> ill look up, thanks didnd know this
[09:12:16] <tw2113> i mis-typed, no quotes
[09:12:29] <tw2113> just (odd) or (even)
[09:12:47] <Sfischer> I have a jquery image slider that pulls images from an unordered list on my webpage. I want to change the image source contents of that unordered list when I click on a certain div. Whats the best way to do that?
[09:12:51] <ryanneufeld> sunbeam: http://caniuse.com/#search=nth-child
[09:13:22] <ryanneufeld> sunbeam: http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/evenodd.en.html
[09:13:37] <sunbeam> nice..
[09:13:39] <tw2113> if you need IE8 using nth-child, http://selectivizr.com/
[09:13:43] <sunbeam> yea
[09:14:21] <rmill> jQuery has :odd and :even selectors too, non?
[09:14:22] <zsoc> hey look it works. genius. I love jquery just as much as i hate javascript, heh.
[09:14:26] <rmill> ?:odd
[09:14:26] <bot-t> :odd: Selects odd elements, zero-indexed. See also even. http://api.jquery.com/odd-selector/
[09:14:39] <tw2113> if you want to add some jquery to do the same styling, sure
[09:14:54] <tw2113> just add selectivizr and i think it picks up on the css somehow
[09:15:02] <themojowill> I am creating a price slider using jQuery UI slider, I have the sliders all setup and working great thanks to Cork what I want is to show a visual representation of the items picked on the slider, So if the user selects 5 racks 5 little images of racks are shown?
[09:27:51] <Whirl3d> ? .closest
[09:27:52] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[09:30:49] <macmartine> This is strange, but anyone aware of removeClass() causing a script to halt? I have an animation right after a removeClass call that occasionally doesn't run if the removeClass call comes before it
[09:33:06] <ezioa> macmartine, i can assure you it's not removeclass's fault
[09:33:26] <macmartine> ezioa: yeah, figured
[09:33:55] <ezioa> the fault may lie in using removeclass to do what you're doing
[09:35:46] <macmartine> ezioa: The removeClass call isn't really related to the animation that doesn't get run: https://gist.github.com/3812886 -- It's the second the last line that sometimes doesn't run
[09:36:13] <ezioa> perhaps something is related to the class that you're removing?  ... i don't know
[09:36:25] <ezioa> scrollleft?
[09:36:35] <macmartine> yeah, scrollLeft
[09:36:58] <zsoc> http://jsfiddle.net/vRGtj/ <-- anyone explain why i'm getting [Object object] in this context?
[09:37:00] <ezioa> dude .... juse semi colons.  oh god htis is horrible
[09:37:21] <ezioa> you're missing brackets
[09:37:28] <ezioa> semi colons
[09:37:33] <macmartine> ezioa: it's coffee script, yo
[09:37:34] <ezioa> try coding properly first buds
[09:37:51] <macmartine> ezioa: http://coffeescript.org/
[09:37:52] <NoiseEee> zsoc: what do you want? the price?  try .text() / reading manual
[09:38:45] <arielserafini> zsoc, contents returns an array
[09:38:48] <ezioa> okay
[09:38:51] <zsoc> NoiseEee, .text returns.... even more interesting results? http://jsfiddle.net/vRGtj/1/ .. i'm just trying to get the content. The text that's contained in the dom. I didn't think it would be complex.
[09:39:02] <zsoc> Arieh, oh i see... it seems to still happen without using contents however
[09:39:15] <BillCriswell> zsoc: You forgot the ().
[09:39:30] <ezioa> macmartine, i'd rather see the compiled version
[09:39:34] <ezioa> to avoid abiguity
[09:39:47] <ezioa> i cannot type ffs
[09:40:01] <zsoc> Well, without an additional function is still returning an object.... http://jsfiddle.net/vRGtj/4/ ... is it because there's another tag within that element? (strong)
[09:40:25] <BillCriswell> zsoc: No shit it's an object.
[09:40:46] <zsoc> BillCriswell, there we go, that's the answer i was looking for. call me sherlock.
[09:41:46] <Whirl3d> Would someone please look at this fiddle and tell me if there is a better way to have a common"descr" field that updates with mouseenter? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/MnFve/20/
[09:41:51] <BillCriswell> zsoc: Glad you got it working.
[09:42:01] <GranMal> anyone know how I can parse JSON like this with jQuery? test({"test1":"This is a test", "test2":"This is another test"});
[09:42:21] <Whirl3d> GranMal, what do you mean parse?
[09:42:41] <aca20031> json is part of javascript, hence â€œjavascriptâ€ object notation
[09:42:55] <maxaud> why not just use: JSON.parse() ?
[09:43:19] <maxaud> assuming it's a string
[09:43:21] <ezioa> Whirl3d, yes ... data
[09:43:24] <GranMal> It's returning an error â€¦ I'm not used to getting inside the test(); part
[09:43:43] <zsoc> here is my solution, in case anyone cares or wants to see if it's not hideous enough for production: http://jsfiddle.net/vRGtj/8/
[09:43:46] <BillCriswell> GranMal: That's probably become of JSONP
[09:43:57] <Whirl3d> ezoia, I am using data.
[09:44:07] <BillCriswell> GranMal: jsonp*
[09:44:42] <GranMal> BillCriswell: That answers my question, I haven't used jasonp before â€¦ I'll read up on it â€¦ thanks
[09:46:06] <maxaud> zsoc, why not use .html() ?
[09:46:17] <Cameron_> how do i make a script run after absolutely everything has loaded
[09:46:24] <mry4n> is indexOf() the best way to determine if a substring is in a string?
[09:46:28] <zsoc> maxaud, that's why i asked :) ty
[09:46:28] <Cameron_> apparently $(document).ready isnt complete
[09:47:41] <ezioa> Whirl3d, what part are you trying to simplfy
[09:48:27] <ezioa> you could also store the descr as an attribute
[09:50:41] <eip56> What is considered the best practice when declaring an empty variable as an object property? propertyName: '',  ?
[09:51:34] <BillCriswell> mry4n: Yes.
[09:52:53] <BillCriswell> mry4n: 'bill'.indexOf('bill') > -1
[09:53:59] <BillCriswell> Just be careful cause it will return 0 which is falsy.
[09:55:03] <xrdodrx> Is there any way I can make jQuery-UI parse this json? http://sicp.tv:8080/mturk/keywords.json
[09:55:20] <xrdodrx> currently it returns that whole list for label, but i want it to return every individual element in the list
[09:58:27] <BillCriswell> xrdodrx: You just want to loop through results[0].label ?
[09:59:14] <xrdodrx> BillCriswell: Yes.
[09:59:32] <xrdodrx> I also want to stop it from requesting that json every time. It's never going to change :(
[10:01:21] <BillCriswell> Just throw it in a variable.
[10:02:16] <xrdodrx> OK
[10:02:50] <BillCriswell> xrdodrx: http://jsfiddle.net/bm2wh/ exanoke
[10:02:54] <BillCriswell> example*
[10:05:00] <xrdodrx> That works BillCriswell :)
[10:05:07] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeet.
[10:05:11] <xrdodrx> I was trying to be fancy by using an external source
[10:05:14] <xrdodrx> ;)
[10:08:08] <zsoc> http://jsfiddle.net/vRGtj/31/ <-- when you select "florida" and then go back and select a different state, a space appears between the dollar sign and the amount.. i can't figure out where that space is coming from.
[10:08:15] <BillCriswell> xrdodrx: If would make sense if this data changed regularly, but since it isn't no need.
[10:09:14] <zsoc> hm ok, so parseInt() fixes it, but I have no idea why.
[10:09:30] <zsoc> I'd be interesting in knowing why adding it as a string adds a space but parsing as integer first does not
[10:11:03] <[1]MarcelT3> hey folks, while trying to write a navigation panel for a simple image slider with jquery i ran into the need to replace the whole nav-panel using the .replaceWith() method.
[10:12:34] <[1]MarcelT3> the thing is, after it was replaced once, the menu does not work correctly. is there a better way to change the menu from inside jquery?
[10:12:45] <BillCriswell> zsoc: A string can have a space in it, an integer can't.
[10:13:23] <zsoc> BillCriswell, good enough reason, so clearly there's a space in my string and it's just being removed when i type select
[10:14:51] <BillCriswell> zsoc: The easy answer is http://jsfiddle.net/vRGtj/34/
[10:15:36] <zsoc> BillCriswell, i see... the space was "after", but i guess it still makes sense. ty
[10:17:37] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[10:33:19] <EdwardIII> hrm, stuck on an issue
[10:33:24] <EdwardIII> i've got a form with some tinymce fields in it
[10:33:56] <EdwardIII> when i run $('#my-form').validate() i get Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'split'
[10:34:40] <EdwardIII> i saw this, which looked promising, but i just upgraded to the latest verion of tinymce and no joy: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues/457
[10:41:22] <xboi209> How can I isolate a certain element on a page using $.get?
[10:42:02] <NoiseEee> xboi209: hmmm?
[10:42:24] <xboi209> like if I were to write $.get('test.html', function(data) {
[10:42:35] <xboi209> using the data variable returns the entire page's code
[10:42:37] <Whirl3d> is there a .farthest() method or equiv that finds the topmost element that matches the filter criteria...so $("li").farthest("ul") would find the topmost "ul" in the chain.
[10:43:00] <xboi209> I just want a certain element rather than the whole page
[10:43:23] <mariuscc> any clue if I can access first property of jQuery.browser without iterating it and knowing the property name ?
[10:43:56] <zsoc> .first ?
[10:44:10] <EdwardIII> xboi209: $('.area').load('page.html #the-div-you-want', function(...
[10:44:34] <xboi209> But I don't really want to load the thing
[10:44:47] <xboi209> I'm trying to get $.get to proccess the data
[10:44:53] <danheberden> Whirl3d: you'd want to use .parents('ul') and then get the last one
[10:45:04] <danheberden> parents('ul').eq(-1) or whatevser
[10:45:46] <mariuscc> zsoc not working .. undefined
[10:45:46] <NoiseEee> xboi209: if you're telling JS to load "page.html" and then complaining it's returning all of "page.html"....
[10:46:18] <xboi209> well is there any way i select something from everything that's loaded
[10:46:33] <rogo> trying to resize a div dynamically with a function but it only works in one direction, it gets smaller when needed but if i resize the window larger it doesn't size back out. wondering if i missed something, function here: http://jsfiddle.net/3yBDS/
[10:46:45] <xboi209> because the .load thing adds unnecessary space to the page
[10:47:02] <NoiseEee> xboi209: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1529464/parsing-html-string-with-ajax-jquery
[10:47:21] <NoiseEee> xboi209: you should also consider ajax/xhr-ing to a page that only delivers what you want.
[10:48:28] <[1]MarcelT3> can someone pls tell me why the menu does work only once? http://jsfiddle.net/PaxqL/3/ is there some dependence in replaceWith() ?
[10:50:14] <zsoc> mariuscc, interesting... well it's a depreciated property, so im not sure it can be handled without iteration
[10:51:37] <mariuscc> zsoc: thanks, it seams that is working like Object.keys(jQuery.browser)[0]
[10:51:50] <zsoc> thats one way of doin git
[10:51:57] <Whirl3d> so .parentsUntil doesn't return the topmost element? Why is that?
[10:52:24] <danheberden> mariuscc: not just deprecated, it will be removed in 1.9 btw
[10:52:33] <danheberden> Whirl3d: because "until" stops
[10:52:40] <danheberden> hence why you need to get all the matching parents
[10:52:43] <danheberden> to get the "last" one
[10:52:45] <danheberden> as i said above
[10:53:06] <Whirl3d> didn't see your reply above, sry. Checking now
[10:54:22] <danheberden> which i you could do $.fn.furthest = function(sel){ return this.parents(sel).eq(-1); }
[10:54:27] <danheberden> which i *guess
[11:03:04] <obfuscode> afternoon, need some guidance for overriding the ajaxComplete method for just 1 ajax call, cannot permanently override it - embedding a script on another person's site - their ajaxComplete is hijacking my ajax call
[11:03:51] <Whirl3d> I am sure that I am making this much more difficult than necessary: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/sBmLe/2/
[11:08:23] <mry4n> Thanks, Bill for the answer. Just saw it.
[11:10:39] <Whirl3d> dahneberden, .parents(sel) stops at the first parent that matches the selector, doesn't it. Its not like .parents() gives you the entire heirarchy above an element, it just gives you the immediate parent element...?
[11:12:15] <danheberden> Whirl3d: parents() should give you _every_ matching element that is a parent
[11:12:37] <danheberden> parents(selector) === parents().filter(selector)
[11:13:09] <Whirl3d> danheberden. Wow. I have been doing jquery for a couple years now and always thought .parents() stopped on the first match. It only makes sense that it works the way you indicate, I just never used it like that....wild.
[11:13:20] <danheberden> parentsUntil does :)
[11:13:31] <danheberden> also, you're thinking of closest
[11:13:38] <danheberden> wrt getting that 'one' element up the stree
[11:13:41] <danheberden> *tree
[11:16:08] <dogarrhea2> hmm i'm having some trouble with a resizing issue.
[11:16:58] <dogarrhea2> sometimes when i try to resize a widget by clicking and dragging a corner and moving the mouse very quickly, the resize stops and the mouse is no longer attached to the resizing corner. i know this is really quit general/vague, but has anyone encountered this?
[11:17:40] <Whirl3d> I wonder how many times my script broke because I thought .parents() would always only return one element and instead returned the entire heirarchy. I figured there would be a .family() or .ancestors() method to get the results that .parents() actually returns. LOL
[11:18:16] <Whirl3d> Thanks for your help and insight, danheberden.
[11:22:38] <danheberden> Whirl3d: heh, i think we all get that, like, instilled memory of how an api works only to find out later that we were using it wrong. At least I know it's happened to me
[11:29:42] <jayd3e> so in the "new myspace" introduction video(https://new.myspace.com/play) they are using overlays heavily, for search, their create status page, few other things that I can't recall.  Are overlays pretty performant if your using straight-up jquery as opposed to a front-end widget suite
[11:30:34] <jedimind> that's more pertaining to the UX/Design than anything at all related to your technology stack
[11:30:39] <jayd3e> I just feel like every site I've ever been to that uses modals/overlays only work on good hardware, and are become a pain to use with low bandwidth
[11:31:12] <jedimind> old hardware and low bandwidth are generally not that big of a consideration these days when building something that's geared towards a more tech savvy consumer base
[11:31:33] <jayd3e> jedimind: yah true.  and that was the essence of my question ^^
[11:31:33] <jedimind> if you're building a mom and pop malt liqour site for south korea, then yes, those are considerations
[11:31:59] <jedimind> but if you're building something that's an online business model and relies on early adopters especially
[11:32:12] <jedimind> then the likelyhood of your users using outdated hardware is significantly lower if not non existent
[11:32:23] <jedimind> the bottom line being, it depends on your intended user base
[11:33:40] <Whirl3d> if I am trying to capture the "mouseenter" event using .on applied to a ul, shouldn't it fire both when the mouse enters the ul and every subsequent mouseenterable element?
[11:33:46] <EdwardIII> in south korea won't they be viewing your website on some futuristic blade-runneresque flashy lighted computer connected to broadband 20x faster than the speed of light?
[11:34:23] <jayd3e> jedimind: my dilemma is my site is for students, so they are almost certainly going to have good hardware most of the time, but they also use netbooks, tablets, etc.  i feel like every device under the sun, so I feel like hardware contraints still come into play
[11:34:40] <jayd3e> there have been sites released in my space that have been really front-end heavy and are just a pain to use
[11:35:03] <sigurding> anyone here using angularJS?
[11:35:39] <jedimind> jayd3e, well the other side of that is really understanding the utility of your application and its user experience
[11:35:43] <dogarrhea2> hrm. this wat talk is funny.
[11:35:48] <jedimind> and question if and when such interactions are required at all
[11:35:54] <jedimind> it may be fancy, but if its not needed, then dont do it
[11:35:58] <dogarrhea2> [] +{} = [object Object]
[11:36:20] <EdwardIII> best nick ever
[11:36:23] <Taggnostr> hello
[11:36:26] <jayd3e> jedimind: kk gotcha.
[11:36:30] <jayd3e> thanks
[11:36:37] <jedimind> np
[11:37:07] <dogarrhea2> EdwardIII: whos nick?
[11:37:12] <EdwardIII> yours
[11:37:19] <EdwardIII> also enjoying jedimind's balanced advice
[11:37:43] <dogarrhea2> hrm someone comments on this nick every day  justa bout.
[11:38:22] <dogarrhea2> it started out as me calling my sister "diarrhea" because she ate something wrong in China. then she bought a dachshund for a pet.  Now her coworkers call her that because i called her that in front of them at google while eating lunch one day.
[11:38:37] <Taggnostr> I have something like .each(function (index, elem) { var e = $(this); ... }), and while profiling I noticed that e = $(this) seems to be somewhat slow, do you know what might be the reason?
[11:38:43] <jedimind> so, what you're saying is, is you're using a nickname which is actually your sisters
[11:38:48] <jholloman> dogarrhea2: so what you're saying is your sister doesn't like you much
[11:39:16] <dogarrhea2> she has me watch her dogs on the weekend while she and her husband are doing dirty things in hawaii
[11:39:32] <jholloman> Taggnostr: are you passing in standard elements? If so I'm not sure if you can speed it up
[11:39:57] <jholloman> Taggnostr: there's always some overhead to the $(), so avoiding it if possible is always nice
[11:41:19] <Taggnostr> jholloman, I was wondering if using $(elem) instead of $(this) might be faster.  They seem to be the same object, but I don't know if there are any differences with their scope
[11:41:41] <jholloman> they'll have the same scope and should be equivilent
[11:41:50] <Taggnostr> ok
[11:41:52] <jholloman> if you put a "debugger;" statement in the code
[11:42:01] <jholloman> you can double check that they're both present within the scope
[11:42:10] <Taggnostr> interesting
[11:42:56] <Taggnostr> jholloman, I'm surprised that it seems even slower than doing e.text() and doing a regex search on the text
[11:43:27] <jholloman> that is interesting I didn't realize $() would be that slow, how are you profiling it?
[11:43:43] <Taggnostr> with firebug
[11:44:12] <EdwardIII> hrm, i see jQuery validate has an option onsubmit which you can use to disable the submit validation
[11:44:34] <EdwardIII> dang namit, i really just want to cut in, say 'populate these textareas with tinymce's data', then validate
[11:44:40] <EdwardIII> i guess i could just do that in submitHandler
[11:44:41] * EdwardIII tinkers
[11:45:13] <Taggnostr> the code basically does var e = $(this); if (re.test(e.text)) e.show(); else e.hide()
[11:45:46] <jholloman> seems simple enough
[11:46:25] <EdwardIII> hah damn, onsubmit: false disables submitHandler
[11:46:33] <Taggnostr> jholloman, could it be that the profiler only reported the assignment on my js file, and the rest from the jquery file?
[11:47:21] <Taggnostr> i.e. if the e.text() is slow it's reported in the text() method of jquery.js rather than the 'if' in myscript.js
[11:47:35] <jholloman> i've never tried profiling with with firebug before, so not sure how it would handle thaty
[11:53:44] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/sBmLe/19/  any reason why mouseleave isn't propogating  When the menu is moused out, it should hide
[11:54:37] <peppe01> ciao
[11:54:39] <peppe01> !list
[11:57:31] <faraway> Whirl3d: you listen to mouseleave on navMenu, and that div has the same width as the window
[11:58:07] <faraway> Whirl3d: ah sorry. didn't, see the other on
[12:00:11] <bfig> hello, how can i make sure two events execute in order?
[12:00:51] <bfig> ie, i'm refactoring an ajax call and i want to move the 'beforesend' parameter outside the ajax (and still make sure they execute in that order)
[12:01:30] <faraway> Whirl3d: i think the problem is the $(e.target)
[12:03:24] <Whirl3d> faraway, thanks for the replies. I think you were right to begin with. I made the menu display:inline-block to autoadjust the width and it works like a charm. Thanks!
[12:04:40] <faraway> Whirl3d: hmmm ... well target seems to be ok ... there must be something else with the code below in the clearFocus
[12:05:06] <faraway> Whirl3d: some wrong assumptions in the if clauses i would guess
[12:16:05] <invisib> Anyone know why I might be getting this error? "Cannot call method 'show' of undefined"
[12:16:40] <Whirl3d> I'm gonn go out on a limb and say because you are calling the show method on a bad selector?
[12:17:51] <Whirl3d> if you assign a variable to your selection results, then you can check to see if your selection returned a valid element by checking the variables length:   var showables=$(".someclass"); if (showables && showables.length) showables.show();
[12:18:11] <macmartine> How can I get the height of an iframe from within that iframe?
[12:19:09] <invisib> Whirl3d: Yep you're right
[12:19:20] <jedimind> macmartine, is this for facebook ?
[12:19:22] <invisib> Apparently this jerk plugin needed me to use their markup conventions
[12:19:24] <invisib> :(
[12:19:28] <macmartine> jedimind: no
[12:19:28] <invisib> Thanks
[12:19:30] <jedimind> what a jerk, that plugin.
[12:19:46] <Whirl3d> invisib, np.
[12:23:31] <s10z> Hi there, I am currently working on some port of jQuery twitter bootstrap stuff. While doing so, I came across some idiom saying this.$body ..
[12:23:56] <s10z> What is done by this command? Feels like some jQuery magic lies inside I do not get up with
[12:24:23] <Whirl3d> ugggh. s10z, that's a terrible naming convention that uses the $ literal in front of the element name to indicate that it's the jquery object not the element itself. I hate that.
[12:24:37] <s10z> ah, ok
[12:24:58] <s10z> hoped it is just some weird stuff i can ignore^^
[12:25:04] <s10z> thanks, Whirl3d
[12:25:09] <Whirl3d> var $body=$(body); or var $junk=$(".junk");   but it gets ugly and confusing to read for me...is it $("body") or $body...not sure
[12:25:45] <jholloman> $ _ and a few others are all valid for variable names
[12:26:03] <Whirl3d> I avoid using the string literal $ as part of my variable name because its Hungarian notation for one, and just ugly for two.
[12:26:31] <Whirl3d> just cause you can use it doesn't mean you should. imho
[12:27:16] <silverwind> Whirl3d++
[12:27:19] <jholloman> i'm still torn on it
[12:27:39] <jholloman> I work in a convoluted environment, where specifying that it is already wrapped is potentially useful
[12:28:09] <jholloman> think it depends on the project and team you're working with
[12:28:21] <Whirl3d> In that case, I use suffices with separators. like var section_btn=$(".sectionButton");
[12:28:49] <Whirl3d> not $sectionButton=$(".sectionButton") ; too easy for me to omit the ("") at the wrong time
[12:29:22] <Whirl3d> but you are right, it's totally a matter of personal style. Some of us have it some don't....jk
[12:29:36] <jholloman> haha
[12:29:55] <ravenzz> Whirl3d the $ should remember the developer that the variable stores a jquery object
[12:30:12] <Whirl3d> personal preference....again, not for me.
[12:30:23] <Whirl3d> I understand it, but hate it no less
[12:31:00] <Eviltwin> I think there are too many other evil practices out there to worry about how people choose variable names
[12:31:44] <jholloman> yeah the important thing it to teach new people that $ isnt magic, it's just a character
[12:31:48] <Whirl3d> True, but I would be willing to bet (not a lot) that every day we get the same question about the $ prefixed varible naming convention.
[12:32:27] <Eviltwin> Well not every day in here
[12:32:34] <Eviltwin> Probably once every other week
[12:32:43] <ajpiano> bot-t: ?$prefix
[12:32:45] <bot-t> ajpiano, Files Changed 20 - GitHub - https://github.com/VeriteCo/TimelineJS-Wordpress-Plugin/pull/25/files
[12:32:50] <ajpiano> weird
[12:32:56] <Eviltwin> But I'm sure there are StackOverflow or forum questions more frequently
[12:33:07] <Eviltwin> IRC is a last resort for most people
[12:37:23] <xrdodrx> Why doesn't .mouseenter() work on buttons?
[12:37:30] <xrdodrx> And how can I work around this?
[12:39:31] <xrdodrx> http://jsfiddle.net/9aVfX/
[12:39:34] <xrdodrx> ^ example
[12:39:56] <xrdodrx> It works when disabled="true" isn't there but I want to trigger a validation function when a user hovers over the disabled button
[12:40:22] <spaceman817> Is there any easy way to refresh/add events on objects loaded through an ajax call?
[12:40:45] <NoiseEee> xrdodrx: why hover vs clicking
[12:40:50] <NoiseEee> hovering would seem super extra annoying
[12:41:17] <xrdodrx> doesn't work either NoiseEee.
[12:41:18] <jholloman> spaceman817: you can add events to objects loaded from ajax just like any normal element, and if you use event delegation then they will already have the events
[12:41:30] <xrdodrx> I tried clicking first.
[12:41:43] <xrdodrx> I can't get anything to fire when a user does anything with a disabled button.
[12:42:12] <NoiseEee> xrdodrx: thats because its you know, disabled.
[12:42:17] <jholloman> bot-t: on
[12:42:18] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:42:43] <xrdodrx> .on() doesn't work either
[12:43:09] <spaceman817> ahh, thanks jholloman
[12:43:36] <NoiseEee> xrdodrx: so then stop showing a disabled button in hopes that someone is going to use the disabled button
[12:43:45] <NoiseEee> xrdodrx: think of another way to achieve what you want to infer
[12:43:53] <jholloman> xrdodrx: sorry that was for spaceman817, not sure how to do bot-t directed at people
[12:44:05] <xrdodrx> no problem jholloman :)
[12:44:11] <xrdodrx> i guess i will need to rethink things NoiseEee
[12:44:16] <xrdodrx> thank you
[12:44:20] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[12:46:53] <s10z> Tiny Syntax question: What does [[  ]] do? Called in Twitter bootstrap/jQuery with [[ <somePxValue>, <String> ]] ...
[12:49:20] <jholloman> s10z: an array containing one element which is an array containing somePXValue, String is what I would assume
[12:49:40] <jholloman> in standard js, [[]] would just be an empty array in an empty array
[12:50:34] <Zzaichik> mind blown
[12:50:42] <Zzaichik> [[[[]]]]]
[12:50:49] <Zzaichik> Just Kidding.
[12:50:57] <jholloman> Zzaichik: stop that! too many lisp nightmares :(
[12:51:10] <Zzaichik> hahah - sorry, won't happen again
[12:51:16] <jholloman> haha
[12:51:33] <dogarrhea2> (()(()())()))((())())))())))))) that better jholloman
[12:51:39] <jholloman> much hahaha
[12:51:50] <jholloman> parenarrhea
[12:51:56] <Zzaichik> hahhah
[12:52:34] <Zzaichik> (+Â (*Â 6Â 6)Â (*Â 10Â 10))
[12:53:05] <Zzaichik> a nice, simple one, just so you don't freak out
[12:53:43] <jholloman> haha
[12:53:51] <Eviltwin> In OCaml, []'s are used for arrays and [[]]'s are used for lists
[12:54:03] <jholloman> reminds me of an interview question i had where they asked me to code for reverse polish notation interpretation
[12:54:25] <jholloman> so ((6 6 *) (10 10 *) +)
[12:54:40] <dogarrhea2> hrm. doesn't take much to qualify as a high level language these days right?
[12:54:45] <dogarrhea2> just has to be "not assembly"
[12:55:01] <jholloman> i would consider scripting languages to be high level
[12:55:05] <Eviltwin> jholloman: Looks like its designed for a stack machine
[12:55:07] <jholloman> java potentially
[12:55:20] <Zzaichik> bleh
[12:55:53] <Zzaichik> Alright Java isn't THAT bad.
[12:55:59] <Zzaichik> Could be worse..
[12:56:06] <jholloman> anything that doesn't have direct memory access i consider high(er) level
[12:56:20] <jholloman> but python/js are certainly a step higher than java
[12:56:40] <lolbob> Hey guys, I have this fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/HePrU/ It works fine when you click the "More"-link (colour shows and "Less" replaces "More"), but I cant get "Less" to go back to "More" when its clicked again. Hope you can help, thanks!
[12:57:16] <Zzaichik> @lolbob ?on
[12:57:23] <Zzaichik> I'm guessing
[12:57:26] <Zzaichik> ?.on
[12:57:27] <bot-t> Zzaichik, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:57:48] <dogarrhea2> jholloman: i still don't even consider memory access high level.. the OS basically screws you when you try anything so..
[12:57:57] <dogarrhea2> er low levle
[12:58:28] <dogarrhea2> anyways. i am doing console.log every time a mouse move event is detected. will this screw up event handling/performance?
[12:59:06] <jholloman> lol, that's going to take a chunk out of your performance
[12:59:26] <jholloman> printing is a very expensive operation, and mousemove will happen extremely often
[12:59:32] <jholloman> what are you trying to do?
[12:59:34] <Zzaichik> lol
[13:00:30] <dogarrhea2> if you visit sprint.com and use the chat widget to communicate, you can resize. but in console it will tell u every metric about the chat widget hieght width x position etc etc etc on every move
[13:00:58] <dogarrhea2> sometimes the mouse "loses track" of the resize and is no longer attached to the resize corner
[13:01:04] <jholloman> lolbob: make sure you read up about caching your selectors, doing jQuery(this).closest(".portfolio-holder") 2x can be optimized by: var closestHolder = jQuery(this).closest(".portfolio-holder");
[13:01:18] <jholloman> oh that's unfortunate
[13:01:51] <lolbob> thanks, jholloman :-)
[13:02:42] <sjeijk> what is the best way to 'bind' toglle
[13:03:01] <sjeijk> at stack overflow they say use it with live
[13:03:13] <sjeijk> but thats were older posts
[13:03:54] <lolbob> jholloman: any idea on how I can solve the problem?
[13:04:00] <Zzaichik> $('element').on('togile', 'element', function() { â€¦. });
[13:05:00] <jholloman> lolbob: http://jsfiddle.net/HePrU/1/
[13:05:11] <sjeijk> ok tx Zzaichik
[13:05:12] <jholloman> lolbob: what I did was store a variable that I query each click
[13:05:19] <jholloman> it starts off as expanded = false
[13:05:29] <jholloman> when you click it will toggle with expanded = !expanded
[13:05:40] <jholloman> then when setting the text it uses a ternary expression to determine the proper value
[13:05:47] <jholloman> expanded ? "More" : "Less"
[13:06:07] <lolbob> hmm, that's smart :-)
[13:06:14] <jholloman> will give you "More" if it is currently expanded, "Less" if it is currently not expanded
[13:06:55] <lolbob> jholloman: if I do like this: http://jsfiddle.net/HePrU/2/ it doesn't work properly though?
[13:07:48] <lolbob> that "Run" is not supposed to be there btw
[13:08:04] <jholloman> lolbob: right, the problem there is that it's using the same variable for the state of all of the more/less sections
[13:08:15] <lolbob> any way around that?
[13:08:18] <jholloman> so we need to make sure that variable is private
[13:08:41] <lolbob> that sounds right
[13:10:32] <jholloman> lolbob: http://jsfiddle.net/HePrU/3/
[13:10:54] <jholloman> the change i made here was to make the click handler be for the portfolio-holder class if that's acceptable
[13:10:59] <r1card> I don't think I can get the mouse position relative to an element reliably when there are relative/absolute position up the chain. Tips?
[13:11:02] <jholloman> that way we just have 1 click handler per section
[13:11:13] <spaceman817> Am I wrong in thinking that event delegation will not work for calling .buttonset() on buttons I insert into the DOM through ajax?
[13:11:43] <jholloman> lolbob: so with this, we can run an each, and then each section will have it's own variable scoping for our private variable of expanded
[13:12:06] <jholloman> spaceman817: that is correct, you'll need to call buttonset for any new buttonsets inserted
[13:12:43] <alaing> any folk here going to the jquery uk conf in 201
[13:12:44] <alaing> 2013
[13:12:51] <spaceman817> jholloman: thought so, thanks
[13:12:55] <jholloman> np
[13:13:01] <lolbob> it kinda has to be both handlerd, jholloman . Is that possible?
[13:13:09] <lolbob> handlers*
[13:15:23] <raj> is `http://newsite.com/tempdir?home` a valid url?
[13:16:03] <Eviltwin> Yes
[13:17:13] <raj> hmm, k
[13:18:36] <p0tta> quick question
[13:19:00] <p0tta> I have my XML response like this
[13:19:04] <p0tta> <Question>
[13:19:04] <p0tta> 		<QuestionId>278</QuestionId>
[13:19:08] <p0tta> ...
[13:19:12] <p0tta> </Question>
[13:19:34] <p0tta> to parse the XML I was using
[13:19:35] <p0tta> $(xml).find("Question").each(function()
[13:19:35] <p0tta>   {
[13:19:37] <p0tta> }
[13:19:48] * gnarf sighs
[13:19:51] <p0tta> but this goes through all Question tags
[13:19:59] <p0tta> how do I look for a specific question/
[13:20:00] <p0tta> ?
[13:20:02] <gnarf> ?p @p0tta
[13:20:02] <bot-t> p0tta, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:20:15] <gnarf> please, don't paste code in IRC
[13:20:21] <p0tta> oh ok sorry
[13:20:22] <p0tta> will do
[13:20:36] <Eviltwin> p0tta: First you need to identify what about the question you want to find is different from all the rest
[13:20:52] <gnarf> p0tta: why not <Question Id="278">
[13:20:58] <gnarf> or even
[13:21:11] <gnarf> <Question QuestionId="278">
[13:21:27] <p0tta> well I can't change the XML now
[13:21:32] <gnarf> okay
[13:21:36] <Eviltwin> Well that's your bad
[13:21:44] <Eviltwin> Can't blame jQuery for that
[13:22:03] <gnarf> my suggestion, parse the whole thing into an object representation
[13:22:06] <p0tta> i'm new to jQuery so i'm unable to find the exact element
[13:22:27] <gnarf> selecting that specific question is going to be tough because there is no attribute value to select on
[13:22:28] <Eviltwin> Well it'd be helpful to know what the exact element is
[13:22:33] <Eviltwin> Or why you want that element and not another one
[13:22:36] <Eviltwin> What's different about it?
[13:22:53] <Eviltwin> If you're looking for a specific question id
[13:23:15] <p0tta> yeah just want to get the specific question
[13:23:21] <gnarf> p0tta: you want to do something like .find("Question").filter(function() { var id = parseFloat($(this).find("QuestionId").text()); return id === 278; });
[13:23:36] <Eviltwin> I would suggest $(xml).find("QuestionId").filter(function() { return $(this).text() == "123"; }).closest("Question")
[13:24:04] <gnarf> Eviltwin's solution is less finds, but should be the same result
[13:24:17] <Eviltwin> Unless you have more than one QuestionId in a Question
[13:24:18] <gnarf> if the number of "Question" elements is large, go with his
[13:24:20] <Eviltwin> Which I really hope you don't
[13:28:28] <toter> Hiâ€¦ I'm trying to add a page scroller plugin to twitter's bootstrap framework. I am a beginner and I'm not being able to figure out how to successfully add a .js plugin. Could anyone help me?
[13:29:48] <gnarf> toter: um - this is #jquery not ##twitter-bootstrap
[13:30:04] <devmikey> How do you get an event to happen every N seconds?
[13:30:09] <gnarf> toter: but you probably just need to add another script tag
[13:30:16] <gnarf> ?setInterval @devmikey
[13:30:16] <bot-t> devmikey, http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[13:30:41] <toter> gnarf: thanksâ€¦ I'm on the other channel you provided
[13:31:50] <chare> so I implemented chess using drag and drop with jqueryui but the gui update after moving a piece feels a bit sluggish, is there a way to figure out why the update is slow?
[13:32:35] <Whirl3d> has anybody come across a simple, but attractive, dropdown menu that they prefer to use. This is an opinion question, not something you can lookup on Google, so thank you.
[13:32:48] <p0tta> sorry for pasting code again but why cant I do this?
[13:32:49] <p0tta> $(xml).find("Question").each(function()
[13:32:49] <p0tta>   {
[13:32:49] <p0tta> 	if($(this).find("QuestionId").val() === 278){
[13:32:49] <p0tta> 		$("#footer").append($(this).find("Option").text());
[13:32:49] <p0tta> 	}
[13:32:50] <p0tta>   });
[13:33:01] <p0tta> I also need to add some stuff on the footer
[13:33:02] <gnarf> p0tta: see ?p
[13:33:03] <bot-t> p0tta, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:33:04] <Eviltwin> Dude
[13:33:14] <gnarf> p0tta: last warning
[13:33:19] <Eviltwin> .val() != .text()
[13:33:41] <p0tta> last warning for what?
[13:33:44] <gnarf> also Eviltwin++ -- p0tta - just use the code that Eviltwin provided
[13:33:56] <Eviltwin> Not pasting multiple lines of text
[13:34:13] <gnarf> p0tta: please do not paste multiple lines of code in IRC - thank you - please use a pastebin, jsfiddle, gist or something that you can give a link to what you are pasting instead
[13:34:22] <p0tta> oh ok
[13:34:22] <p0tta> cool
[13:34:25] <p0tta> sorry about that again
[13:34:45] <p0tta> guess i dont know the IRC rules
[13:35:33] <gnarf> p0tta: $(xml).find("QuestionId").filter(function() { return $(this).text() == "123"; }).closest("Question").find("Option").contents().appendTo("#footer");
[13:35:58] <gnarf> p0tta: you can look up each of these functions on http://api.jquery.com to find out what they are doing
[13:36:11] <p0tta> will do
[13:36:54] <p0tta> thanks
[13:37:52] <p0tta> works like a charm ... thanks so much ... i will look up the API to see how exactly this is done!
[13:39:59] <dmcdaniel12> Do most browsers not support REST put?
[13:40:24] <gnarf> dmcdaniel12: PUT is not supported very well via any XHR implementation I'm aware of
[13:40:35] <gnarf> dmcdaniel12: i did a bunch of research on this a while back
[13:40:49] <gnarf> but the browser landscape changes, so it may be wrong today
[13:41:05] <dmcdaniel12> gnarf. Damn. I figured so. I keep trying to do a put and it keeps changing it to get...
[13:41:39] <gnarf> dmcdaniel12: yeah, REST is rough to implement from the client end
[13:42:41] <invisib> Hey guys, I'm writing my first jquery slider. What's a good way to go about "cycling" through elements?
[13:42:49] <dmcdaniel12> gnarf - Wish I had done more research on that before we tried it. Spend 40 hours of dev time doing this in REST.
[13:43:03] <gnarf> dmcdaniel12: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/165779/are-the-put-delete-head-etc-methods-available-in-most-web-browsers
[13:43:20] <invisib> Basically, doSomething -> goToNextElement -> doSomething -> goToNextElement -> doSomething -> goToFirstElement
[13:43:25] <dmcdaniel12> gnarf - thanks mate. I appreciate it.
[13:43:37] <invisib> I don't really have a good design pattern for this
[13:43:44] <gnarf> dmcdaniel12: make a POST tunnel
[13:43:53] <gnarf> dmcdaniel12: thats how i ended up solving it
[13:44:10] <silverwind> o_O
[13:44:10] <gnarf> dmcdaniel12: server side tunnel that took POST and converted to PUT/DELETE
[13:44:21] <invisib> Should I make the elements into an array? JSON? Are there jQuery methods that can see if I've reached the end of a list of elements?
[13:44:22] <silverwind> All verbs work with XHR AFAIK
[13:44:27] <silverwind> *HTTP verbs
[13:44:45] <Eviltwin> Yes, I wrote a test page for it and all verbs work in modern browsers
[13:44:46] <gnarf> silverwind: I know there is at least one or two sticking points 2 years ago
[13:44:48] <dmcdaniel12> gnarf - thanks for the info. I will research that more. This is the first project I have worked on rest with.
[13:44:56] <Eviltwin> Including things like TEAPOT and random other verbs that no one uses
[13:45:05] <gnarf> Eviltwin: good to know
[13:45:17] <gnarf> like i said, last i studied was like 2-3 years ago, which is "ages" in browsers
[13:45:19] <gnarf> :)
[13:45:24] <invisib> Anyone?
[13:45:39] <Eviltwin> invisib: Look at how the billion existing jQuery sliders work?
[13:45:47] <Eviltwin> Or just use one of them
[13:46:24] <gnarf> invisib: https://gist.github.com/3031719
[13:46:37] <invisib> Just trying to learn. The billion jquery sliders out there get convoluted to a newb pretty quick
[13:47:22] <gnarf> invisib: someone else asked the same question a few months back -- thats about the simplest implementation i could think of
[13:47:33] <callumacrae> wtf
[13:47:33] <callumacrae> TypeError: 'undefined' is not a valid argument for 'in' (evaluating 'b in a')
[13:47:36] <invisib> Thanks gnarf :)
[13:47:36] <callumacrae> sometimes I hate jQuery
[13:47:52] <ryanneufeld> callumacrae: yjsy
[13:47:57] <gnarf> callumacrae: sometimes using minified source hates you
[13:47:57] <callumacrae> Yes?
[13:48:08] <invisib> gnarf: Why queue?
[13:48:16] * callumacrae sighs
[13:48:19] <ryanneufeld> callumacrae: sorry twitched, and that wasn't what i was gonna say
[13:48:21] <danzik171> Eviltwin: wasn't TEAPOT a response code, not a verb?
[13:48:30] <callumacrae> Let's delete random lines and see if the error goes away
[13:48:42] <ryanneufeld> ?ftjq
[13:48:42] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[13:48:44] <gnarf> invisib: queue is just a function defined on line 29, it is used from a few places
[13:49:19] <gnarf> invisib: it sets a "timeout" to call advance()
[13:49:30] <sporkf> where can I find the values for and their coresponding meanings for $.ajax's  jqXHR.status ?
[13:49:47] <gnarf> the hover(...) call stops the timeout on mouseenter, and re-queues on mouseleave
[13:49:54] <callumacrae> It's because I was trying to change the scrollTop of the document, instead of the element
[13:49:55] <silverwind> sporkf: They're HTTP status codes afaik
[13:49:57] <callumacrae> wat
[13:50:05] <sporkf> silverwind: what does 0 mean?
[13:50:28] <silverwind> sporkf: Some weird jquery value... It's not a HTTP code
[13:50:49] <sporkf> well I'm looking for the official documentation so I make a wise decision of how to handle it.
[13:52:42] <gnarf> sporkf: 0 means it never got a result, or the query type can't provide a status
[13:53:04] <sporkf> gnarf: got the link saying that ?
[13:53:09] <gnarf> sporkf: no
[13:53:20] <gnarf> sporkf: its just the "starting value"
[13:53:41] <gnarf> what kind of request is it?
[13:53:41] <sporkf> gnarf: how do you know ?
[13:54:05] <sporkf> I think POST
[13:54:12] <FrozenFire> I'm trying to do a fadein of each li in a list when it loads (or is ready, rather). I can't seem to get it to work. My thought was something like $(".MyList li").ready(function() { $(this).hide().fadeIn('slow'); });
[13:54:15] <FrozenFire> But that doesn't work
[13:54:42] <FrozenFire> Alternatively, fading in the img in each li would also work (and be better)
[13:54:49] <silverwind> FrozenFire: .ready only works with the document
[13:55:02] <gnarf> sporkf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L444-520
[13:55:18] <FrozenFire> silverwind, Well there's my problem, probably.
[13:55:19] <lethjakman_work> hey
[13:55:28] <lethjakman_work> I have a $('#something').hover
[13:55:33] <lethjakman_work> is there a way to toggle that on and off?
[13:55:40] <FrozenFire> silverwind, Though, that doesn't seem to work.
[13:56:05] <FrozenFire> Do I have to somehow delegate it?
[13:56:13] <invisib> Thanks again gnarf. :)
[13:56:35] <gnarf> sporkf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L436 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L689 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L709
[13:56:36] <silverwind> FrozenFire: Something like: $(document).ready(function() { $('.MyList li').fadeIn('slow'); }); might work.
[13:56:58] <gnarf> sporkf: so it ends up being 0 in cases where there are no transport, ajax is aborted, or some exception occured
[13:57:10] <FrozenFire> silverwind, Well, I need to to happen as each individual element loads.
[13:57:15] <gnarf> or the XHR implementation returns some errant status code under 0
[13:57:17] <FrozenFire> I know it's stupid, but the client wants this effect
[13:57:27] <FrozenFire> Where each item in the list fades in, sequentially.
[13:57:42] <silverwind> FrozenFire: You'll probably have to fake it.
[13:58:08] <silverwind> FrozenFire:By using a setTimeout to do a sleep between each elements
[13:58:36] <FrozenFire> Bah.
[13:58:53] <FrozenFire> Stupid clients and their stupid effects
[13:58:53] <FrozenFire> :P
[13:59:23] <paul_irish> FrozenFire: I have something for that
[13:59:45] <lethjakman_work> FrozenFire: you can run the .loaded(function () {}); on each element can't you?
[13:59:53] <paul_irish> wat
[13:59:54] <paul_irish> no
[14:00:07] <FrozenFire> paul_irish, I'd love to see it :)
[14:00:30] <ahoih> Hi , I use Responsive Slider WP plugin  (using jquery FlexSlider)
[14:00:44] <ahoih> but it gives a strange feeling when loading the page :
[14:00:50] <callumacrae> egh, forgot that it is tuesday tomorrow, and I don't have a regex challenge ready >_<
[14:00:53] <ahoih>  first all page is displayed, then everything is moving in order to display the slider !
[14:00:58] <FrozenFire> ahoih, When a boy becomes a man...
[14:00:59] <FrozenFire> :P
[14:01:29] <BillCriswell> callumacrae: You have a regex challenge for other people to solve every tuesday?
[14:01:42] <ahoih> FrozenFire: what do you mean ? :)
[14:01:44] <callumacrae> http://callumacrae.github.com/regex-tuesday/
[14:01:47] <callumacrae> :-D
[14:01:55] <FrozenFire> ahoih, Making a joke about "it gives a strange feeling"
[14:02:02] <FrozenFire> Ignore me
[14:02:09] <ahoih> okay sorry ;)
[14:02:43] <ahoih> lol
[14:03:00] <BillCriswell> callumacrae: This seems fun.
[14:03:36] <callumacrae> BillCriswell: It's hillarious looking at the traffic. On tuesdays I usually get a few thousands visitors, and then every other day < 100 xD
[14:04:48] <FrozenFire> paul_irish, If you do happen to find your solution, would you mind PM'ing it to me? I have to go AFK now for a bit.
[14:04:55] <paul_irish> FrozenFire:
[14:04:55] <paul_irish> http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[14:05:00] <FrozenFire> Ah, great
[14:05:01] <FrozenFire> Thanks
[14:05:07] <paul_irish> the 4th code example
[14:05:12] <BillCriswell> callumacrae: Assuming this field turns green when I get it?
[14:05:14] <paul_irish> just change fadeOut to fadeIn and you're golden
[14:05:30] <callumacrae> BillCriswell: Test cases go green when they succeed, yes
[14:05:40] <callumacrae> When all the test cases are green, you win!
[14:05:41] <callumacrae> xD
[14:06:04] <FrozenFire> paul_irish, Wonderful. Thanks a bunch
[14:06:12] <paul_irish> just tested it again
[14:06:15] <paul_irish> and you'll love it
[14:06:41] <Eviltwin> paul_irish: Is there actually a need for the .length test?
[14:07:01] <Eviltwin> Wouldn't you just have jq.eq(0) be empty on the last iteration then
[14:07:05] <Eviltwin> So the callback wouldn't fire
[14:08:13] <FrozenFire> paul_irish, I assume I'd call this on the first child?
[14:08:45] <FrozenFire> Heh. However I did this made it shit itself
[14:09:26] <FrozenFire> Oh I see
[14:09:43] <FrozenFire> As much as I thank you, that's why I hate clever logic
[14:09:48] <webBuilder> hello friends I'm trying to put this in html via div <img  src="../thumbnail?v=14TOkwB4P&amp;p=17" /> for some reason .text is not working is there anyone who can help me with this ?
[14:09:57] <FrozenFire> It was too succinct for me to get what it was doing right away
[14:10:17] <Eviltwin> webBuilder: You probably want .html(), not .text()
[14:10:29] <Eviltwin> see ?html @ webBuilder
[14:10:30] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[14:11:41] <webBuilder> Eviltwin, I did with .html didn't work
[14:13:01] <Eviltwin> paul_irish: http://jsfiddle.net/YD9uh/
[14:13:45] <Eviltwin> The animation runs on zero elements the last time so it doesn't recurse
[14:16:47] <Eviltwin> paul_irish: With callback: http://jsfiddle.net/YD9uh/1/
[14:18:10] <silverwind> Cute
[14:20:45] <paul_irish> FrozenFire: you just pass in the selector for all the items you want to fade
[14:21:44] <FrozenFire> paul_irish, Yeah, figured that out. Didn't occur to me that you were creating a new selector each time which slices the first item off the stack
[14:21:52] <FrozenFire> Thanks
[14:21:55] <paul_irish> slicey dicey
[14:23:57] <sjeijk> whats wrong with this? $(this + '> .customer-details').hide();
[14:24:04] <Eviltwin> So many things
[14:24:20] <Eviltwin> Use $(this).children('.customer-details').hide()
[14:24:22] <johnkpaul> sjeijk: try $(this).find('.customer-details').hdie()
[14:24:29] <callumacrae> Phew, got one
[14:24:36] <callumacrae> Regex Tuesday lives on!
[14:27:00] <BillCriswell> callumacrae: I'm still cracking at #4
[14:27:07] <sjeijk> tx, but not working, probably my bad somewhere
[14:27:21] <callumacrae> BillCriswell: #4 wasn't very popular :-(
[14:29:11] <BillCriswell> It's pretty tough, for me at least.
[14:29:17] <sjeijk> ah, its not a child
[14:29:36] <johnkpaul> sjeijk: switch it to find and it should work
[14:32:24] <dogarrhea> huray
[14:32:33] <dogarrhea> we get to use intellij now.
[14:32:37] <sjeijk> not sure why its not working still johnkpaul
[14:32:54] <dogarrhea> i've never used it before. but i'm sick of ecshitpse
[14:33:09] <johnkpaul> ?demo @sjeijk
[14:33:09] <bot-t> sjeijk, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:33:25] <BillCriswell> callumacrae: looking at the first one is making me feel crazy.
[14:33:57] <callumacrae> If you know how to do it, the first one is easy :-)
[14:34:37] <BillCriswell> \d{2} should match two digits... right?
[14:34:54] <callumacrae> Yep
[14:36:00] <sjeijk> http://jsfiddle.net/whuWn/1/ johnkpaul
[14:36:03] <datarecall> how would i monitor a group of checkboxes if they are checked,
[14:38:49] <johnkpaul> sjeijk: this is the column, not the row
[14:39:02] <BillCriswell> callumacrae: Well.. I was reading the results wrong.
[14:39:24] <BillCriswell> I wonder if I had the italic one right too haha
[14:39:28] <johnkpaul> sjeijk: which customer-details do you want to open?
[14:39:34] <johnkpaul> I don't see the logic to where they are placed in the dom
[14:40:33] <sjeijk> well actually i tried to put a div around the 3 rows after the folder tr
[14:41:32] <sjeijk> i wanna open the customer details from the folder above them
[14:42:52] <sjeijk> but a div around it doesn't work with showing and hiding afaik
[14:47:28] <datarecall> doesnt seem like you can attach a click event to a group of checkboxes : $("input[name='dispfilter[]']").click(function(){
[14:48:51] <BillCriswell> datarecall: Do $('input[name^=dispfilter]')
[14:49:24] <BillCriswell> :checkbox[name^=dispfilter] might be a little more safe?
[14:49:51] <johnkpaul> sjeijk: you put a div in the middle of a table?
[14:50:15] <datarecall> BillCriswell that doesnt seem to fire either
[14:50:30] <sjeijk> well johnkpaul i tried
[14:50:41] <sjeijk> but that didn't turned out well
[14:50:54] <johnkpaul> sjeijk: if the customer details are inside a cell, and hidden that would work
[14:51:00] <sjeijk> tbh i don't use tables so much
[14:51:06] <datarecall> ill jsfiddle it
[14:52:14] <NackNick> can someone help me with this ie error im getting from jquery line 2 character 14725 "Object doesn't support this property or method"
[14:52:26] <NackNick> which is pretty crazy to me...
[14:52:47] <sjeijk> is there a way to have a container in a table that holds 3 tr>rd ?
[14:52:56] <shoky> datarecall: your original selector works fine http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/kKecv/
[14:52:56] <NackNick> how can you narrow down a character on 14725?
[14:53:26] <NackNick> I think its being caused by my lightbox
[14:53:39] <NackNick> because the errors arnt there when i take it out
[14:54:01] <shoky> sounds like you narrowed it down pretty good
[14:54:20] <BillCriswell> datarecall: I tried it with this and it worked. http://jsfiddle.net/8RjWw/1/
[14:54:46] <NackNick> this is where the light box is

[14:56:21] <datarecall> thanks BillCriswell
[14:56:26] <ameoba> anyone familiar with the cluetips plugin?  I've got a div that has some tips in it.  At some point, I repopulate the div with an AJAX call & redo my cluetip init but it fails to work the second time.  The HTML it's working on is the same - they're both pulled from the same template so all the ids & classes are the same.  ideas?
[14:56:30] <BillCriswell> datarecall: No problem!
[14:56:30] <NackNick> no no not home time
[14:56:35] <NackNick> help meh!
[14:56:39] <BillCriswell> 6PM!
[14:56:46] <shoky> NackNick: not getting any error there..
[14:56:50] <NackNick> 2:56pm
[14:56:56] <NackNick> in ie?
[14:57:00] <shoky> no
[14:57:07] <BillCriswell> IE can travel through time?
[14:57:15] <NackNick> gotta try the browser that must not be named
[14:57:23] <shoky> no thanks
[14:58:07] <NackNick> its actually in ie 7 and 8
[14:58:15] <NackNick> dont know about 9
[14:58:50] <NackNick> 9 works fine
[14:59:00] <shoky> if you don't want it to say line 2 character 14725
[14:59:02] <NackNick> ie 8 -7 are fkin me up
[14:59:05] <shoky> use a non-minifed jquery ..
[14:59:09] <shoky> not that that'll help you
[14:59:15] <shoky> especially in ie7-8
[14:59:19] <shoky> good luck ;>
[14:59:20] <NackNick> well i know whats giving me the error
[14:59:27] <NackNick> i dont know how to fix it tho
[14:59:54] <NackNick> let me make it pretty
[15:00:52] <NackNick> http://jsfiddle.net/Gqhct/
[15:01:01] <NackNick> its all of that, that ie highlighted
[15:01:06] <shoky> very pretty ....
[15:01:15] <Eviltwin> $("<div>") instead of $(document.createElement("div"))
[15:01:53] <NackNick> talking to me evil?
[15:07:12] <NackNick> yeah that didnt help...
[15:07:17] <NackNick> that made more errors
[15:16:11] <sjeijk> still here johnkpaul?
[15:16:27] <johnkpaul> yes sorry sjeijk
[15:17:02] <sjeijk> o np, just wondering.. I can't figure it out
[15:17:19] <johnkpaul> sjeijk: can you send me an updated fiddle
[15:17:24] <johnkpaul> did you move .customer-details into a cell?
[15:18:40] <sjeijk> not sure what you mean that but i can make a clean start sec

[15:23:50] <bot-t> jQuery.parseXML(data): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[15:24:01] <p0tta> oh ok
[15:24:11] <p0tta> ajpiano ... will look at that
[15:24:21] <shoky> p0tta: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TQzkj/2/
[15:26:11] <devmikey> p0tta: LOL, I'm doing something similar
[15:26:27] <sjeijk> I'm clueless, is there any element that can act like a container in tables for http://jsfiddle.net/whuWn/4/
[15:26:36] <devmikey> Are you setting a different imageURL, btw?
[15:26:46] <devmikey> imgURL I mean
[15:27:00] <p0tta> yeah I am @ devmikey
[15:27:21] <p0tta> shoky ... looks like it works ... will try it, thanks!
[15:27:47] <devmikey> p0tta: In my case, I'm fetching from a php script dynamically, so it's the same URL each time
[15:28:15] <devmikey> p0tta: And when you do that, firefox kinda caches, even if you shut it's cache off
[15:28:22] <p0tta> hmm thats weird
[15:28:50] <shoky> sjeijk: wat?
[15:28:52] <devmikey> but it's not caching because it's going to the trouble of fetching the new image, just not dispalying it
[15:29:08] <sjeijk> i haven't used tables in 9 years
[15:29:11] <devmikey> totally lame
[15:29:18] <shoky> sjeijk: whats your question
[15:29:20] <devmikey> sjeijk: WHy dont you keep it that way
[15:29:42] <sjeijk> well i think what I'm making now is actually a table :)
[15:30:06] <devmikey> You actually have tabular data.  Ok, I'll let you pass
[15:30:07] <sjeijk> shaky i need to make a folder kind of folding tabl
[15:30:14] <sjeijk> shoky
[15:30:51] <ajpiano> sjeijk: the trick to doing that is to put a class on the rows that are the "control" rows and use see ?nextUntil
[15:30:52] <bot-t> sjeijk, .nextUntil([selector], [filter]): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[15:30:57] <sjeijk> but somehow i can't select next or find to target what i need to fold
[15:31:16] <sjeijk> ok
[15:31:20] <ajpiano> also man if i had 5 centrs for every time someone has called shoky "shaky" i'd have at least 15 cents
[15:31:23] <sjeijk> lemme dive into that
[15:31:59] * sjeijk learned new spell ing for sholy 
[15:32:08] <p0tta> also in the bottom there are 3 strings, Tops, Skirts and Shoes ... I would like to change them to 3 buttons
[15:32:15] <p0tta> with the respective labels
[15:32:22] <p0tta> any suggestions on how to go about it/
[15:32:45] <shoky> lol ajpiano ;>
[15:33:22] <sjeijk> arg can you pls copy that last about until next
[15:33:46] <ajpiano> sjeijk: the trick to doing that is to put a class on the rows that are the "control" rows and use see ?nextUntil

[15:33:50] <sjeijk> tx
[15:34:39] <shoky> you could also use seperate <tbody>s if that works for you
[15:35:29] <[knight01]> is there an edit-in-place library or plugin
[15:35:32] <[knight01]> i can't find any good ones
[15:35:35] <[knight01]> they all look like crap
[15:35:52] <[knight01]> that's subjective for enough that i wouldn't use them
[15:36:02] <[knight01]> i want something that keeps the style of whatever elements i'm working with
[15:36:09] <[knight01]> does it exist?

[15:37:10] <CodesStuff> wat
[15:37:41] <sjeijk> shoky got zen coding in ur irc client?
[15:37:55] <shoky> ;] nah
[15:38:13] <sjeijk> looked like it
[15:38:33] <shoky> wouldnt need the ... with zen ;p
[15:38:46] <sjeijk> :)
[15:41:15] <devmikey> is there any jquery effects to make text move around?
[15:41:35] <CodesStuff> .animate?
[15:43:28] <devmikey> maybe
[15:44:22] <devmikey> Load "https://www.developermichael.com/images/logo.png.php", hit reload a few times to see what I'm getting at

[15:53:07] <sjeijk> parent stuff works http://jsfiddle.net/whuWn/7/
[15:53:18] <sjeijk> not pretty but at least its working

[15:59:33] <r1card> reading .css('backgroundPosition') in IE8 fails, ideas?
[16:00:06] <devmikey> i think ie8 calls it something else maybe
[16:00:11] <devmikey> ask in #css
[16:01:09] <MistuhKurtz> r1card, 'background-position' ?
[16:01:34] <MistuhKurtz> r1card, or there might be an issue with shorthand css vs longhand
[16:06:34] <r1card> MistuhKurtz, apparently in IE I can only read CSS I've applied to the element directly and not via... CSS
[16:06:44] <r1card> MistuhKurtz, is this expected? This almost useless
[16:07:05] <MistuhKurtz> r1card, try specifying the bg position in your stylesheet in long hand
[16:07:07] <MistuhKurtz> instead of short hand
[16:07:47] <r1card> MistuhKurtz, huh
[16:08:04] <r1card> MistuhKurtz, it doesn't fail just for position it fails for the entire background property
[16:08:09] <MistuhKurtz> r1card, background-position:0 0;
[16:10:23] <r1card> MistuhKurtz, it didn't help
[16:10:55] <MistuhKurtz> hm

[16:52:55] <dogarrhea2> is there a possibility that javascript engines drop mousemove events in certain situations?
[16:53:17] <dogarrhea2> say on ie8 if you have a 10,000 dpi mouse set to max acceleration/sensitivity and you just move it back and forth really fast
[16:53:39] <dogarrhea2> will all mouse events trigger when they are supposed to?
[16:54:07] <dogarrhea2> or is this more an OS dependent kind of question..
[16:54:31] <dogarrhea2> ice weasel on ubuntu is different from firefox on windows different from firefox on mac with regards to mouse events
[17:07:45] <MGA555> Is the topic jquery datatables fair game here, or is there another channel you can recommend?
[17:29:09] <batdorf> i may have found a bug in jquery 1.8.x, but im not sure. The problem only occurs about 1 out of 10 times I try to reproduce it. I think it's related to the complete method of the .animate() function. It works fine in 1.7.2
[17:34:29] <rmurphey> batdorf: can you make a test case in jsfiddle?
[17:35:51] <batdorf> I can try. The code is quite long. I'll try to isolate the problem and set up a demo
[17:36:09] <rmurphey> you'll definitely want a reduced test case before opening a bug
[17:40:50] <jotham> i have some css assigned with animate() and i want to remove it after a while (rather than animate it) is there a way to remove a css property?

[17:48:35] <phiz> seems like the browser kind of lies about it
[17:55:00] <johnkpaul> phiz: yeah, the browser will follow all redirects transparently
[17:55:08] <johnkpaul> there's nothing you can do about it afaik

[17:56:17] <SCIF> Hi all.
[17:56:53] <SCIF> What selector get elements which contain both classes?
[17:57:04] <SCIF> Like $('.class1.class2')
[17:57:25] <rmurphey> does '.class1.class2' not work?
[18:05:48] <SCIF> Crazy. It works. Therefore â€”Â it's bug of select2 plugin. Thanks ^)
[18:07:05] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take five
[18:16:51] <phiz> hmm silly question, but when you call $.ajax({ ... }).done( function(data)) { ... }); what is the data parameter called, and where would that be documented?
[18:20:16] <coldhead> phiz: in your example it looks like it would be called `data`. you can see an example here where it's called `n` http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[18:21:49] <phiz> coldhead: i guess what i'm looking for is those words that are available, like if i did .done( function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) { ... }); textStatus would be "success"
[18:22:17] <phiz> is that just based on its position in the function() or is it a reserved word?
[18:23:31] <coldhead> it's not a reserved word. data should give you the actual returned data. i'm not sure what the other arguments it provides are. console.log(arguments) might show you?
[18:24:28] <coldhead> first match i can find recommends same http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5796445/what-are-the-arguments-of-jquery-deferred-callbacks
[18:28:04] <initself> why does this totalling machine I built only total the first row?
[18:28:06] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/T6kJA/3/
[18:31:54] <initself> looks like column = $(this).siblings(selector).andSelf().index(this);  stays consistantly 0
[18:32:23] <initself> maybe siblings doesn't mean what it should if you use <tfoot> ?
[18:58:57] <shoky> initself: tfoot should have <tr>s as children, afaik
[18:59:04] <p0tta> quick qn guys
[18:59:06] <p0tta> http://jsfiddle.net/TQzkj/3/
[18:59:20] <p0tta> $(xml).find("QuestionId").filter(function() {
[18:59:20] <p0tta>         return $(this).text() == "278";
[18:59:20] <p0tta>     }).closest("Question").find("Option").contents().appendTo("#footer");
[18:59:28] <p0tta> this line is giving me sum of all options
[18:59:35] <p0tta> how do I get just one?
[18:59:49] <shoky> p0tta: how many times do people have to tell you not to paste code in IRC?
[18:59:55] <initself> shoky: you mean my HTML is wrong?
[18:59:57] <p0tta> its concatenating Option 1 + 2 + 3
[19:00:01] <coldhead> ?:first
[19:00:01] <bot-t> :first: Selects the first matched element. http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[19:00:10] <p0tta> shoky ... I did paste the jsfiddle
[19:00:12] <shoky> initself: yes but no idea if that has to do with your problem
[19:00:18] <shoky> p0tta: you pasted in IRC
[19:00:27] <p0tta> and what I pasted is only 1 line
[19:00:36] <shoky> cut up into 3, yes
[19:00:41] <initself> haha
[19:00:45] <p0tta> :|
[19:00:52] <initself> bad p0tta
[19:00:55] <initself> p0ttamouth
[19:01:00] <p0tta> haha
[19:01:09] <p0tta> i'm used to hearing that a lot ... bad p0tta
[19:01:10] <p0tta> :P
[19:02:10] <shoky> initself: what's all that $(this).parents().prevUntil stuff :\
[19:02:28] <initself> shoky: this is borrowed code, i can't figure it out either
[19:02:36] <shoky> then chuck it out
[19:02:40] <shoky> and make something you understand
[19:02:41] <initself> i do have a working example without tfoot
[19:02:51] <initself> shoky: this is the 3rd time i've tried
[19:03:15] <shoky> that code isn't making much sense to me
[19:03:36] <shoky> also i thought you said this is a totalling machine you built
[19:03:48] <initself> if my current class is 'subtotal', find what column i am in and total all the tds in that column.
[19:03:58] <initself> that have a class of "sum"
[19:04:03] <initself> shoky: i was being cute
[19:04:40] <coldhead> adorable
[19:11:58] <initself> column = $(this).siblings(selector).andSelf().index(this);
[19:12:15] <initself> take my current selector, get all the siblings, add the current selector back on and get the index?
[19:15:45] <shoky> take the current element, plus all its siblings that match 'selector', and in that collection get the index of current element
[19:16:20] <initself> the fact that it returns 0 means there's only match
[19:16:43] <initself> one match
[19:17:01] <shoky> 'this' is only one element, no?
[19:17:06] <initself> yes
[19:17:12] <shoky> how would there be more than one match then
[19:17:30] <shoky> and even if there was, .index never said it'll find more than one
[19:17:31] <initself> why would this need to be so complicated if there will ever only be one match!?
[19:17:48] <shoky> huh.
[19:17:49] <initself> column must not be the value i'm thinking it is
[19:18:06] <initself> i thought it would represent the index of the column i am interested in totalling
[19:18:31] <shoky> .index has nothing to do with columns ?
[19:18:51] <initself> hrm
[19:18:54] <initself> column = $(this).siblings(selector).andSelf().index(this);
[19:18:58] <initself> seems to suggest otherwise?
[19:19:24] <shoky> a random line of code?
[19:26:04] <initself> so i've got a single (or maybe more) td.subtotal.
[19:26:13] <initself> and i want to know, what index is it in its row?
[19:35:38] <patrick99e99> Hey buddies........  Does anyone know of a way to accomplish an ajax POST request from a subdomain to a regular non-subdomain (same domain though)

[19:36:29] <patrick99e99> I was reading up on this
[19:36:32] <patrick99e99> and it seems like.. it's not easy to do?
[19:36:48] <patrick99e99> The only thing I could find was to update the headers to accept POST requests from the subdomain
[19:36:52] <patrick99e99> is that really the best way to go?
[19:39:54] <webBuilder> why jQuery keep converting my '>' to :gt;
[19:40:02] <webBuilder> 	
[19:40:02] <webBuilder> if(jQuery(xml).find('TABLEDATA').children().size() &gt; 0)
[19:40:19] <webBuilder> it's returning an error saying does not know &gt;
[19:40:27] <webBuilder> any hel[p
[19:43:22] <initself> $('td.sum:eq(11)').html() << this doesn't select ALL matching cells?
[19:43:40] <initself> maybe i need each?
[19:45:14] <coldhead> ?:eq
[19:45:14] <bot-t> :eq(index): Select the element at index n within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[19:45:27] <coldhead> as in one single element
[19:45:40] <coldhead> you maybe want to use ?:nth-child
[19:45:40] <bot-t> :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[19:45:52] * initself tries.
[19:47:08] <initself> i dont want to total children
[19:47:20] <initself> i want to told siblings in the same column
[19:47:27] <initself> maybe i just need to iterate?
[19:49:34] <webBuilder> so anyone knows the answer to my question
[19:50:31] <coldhead> initself: td:nth-child(4) will match every <td> in the 5th "column"
[19:50:48] <coldhead> in my ignorance i imagine that's what you want
[19:50:52] <initself> that sounds like what i want!
[19:50:53] <coldhead> clearly i have much to learn
[19:51:07] <coldhead> webBuilder: where are you seeing this occur?
[19:51:28] <coldhead> in a JS file or between <script> tags or are you returning JS via AJAX?
[19:51:38] <coldhead> or something else altogether?
[19:53:25] <webBuilder> coldhead, I coded like this if(jQuery(xml).find('TABLEDATA').children().size() > 0){   it displays like this  [Break On This Error] 	
[19:53:25] <webBuilder> if(jQuery(xml).find('TABLEDATA').children().size() &gt; 0)
[19:53:46] <webBuilder> coldhead, obviously &gt; is not acceptable for html
[19:54:04] <coldhead> you still haven't told me where you have this code
[19:54:08] <coldhead> i'm bored now
[19:54:11] <coldhead> going for a walk
[19:54:14] <initself> don't be bored!
[19:54:25] <initself> we need you to stay engaged with life!
[19:55:26] <webBuilder> coldhead, I'm sorry I see on Error console
[19:55:50] <webBuilder> the error message I see is this
[19:55:50] <webBuilder> SyntaxError: missing ) after condition if(jQuery(xml).find('TABLEDATA').children().size() &gt; 0)
[19:56:08] <webBuilder> the line above you see is the entire error message on firebug
[19:56:18] <webBuilder> coldhead, is that clear enough
[20:07:25] <initself> shoky: here's what i ended up with
[20:07:26] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/T6kJA/22/
[20:07:33] <initself> thanks for encouraging me to write my own code
[20:07:34] <initself> shoky++
[20:07:36] <initself> coldhead++
[20:09:40] <coldhead> webBuilder: where is the code which is triggering this error
[20:09:46] <coldhead> where does the browser find it
[20:14:41] <webBuilder> coldhead, here is the code I coded like this if(jQuery(xml).find('TABLEDATA').children().size() > 0)
[20:15:07] <webBuilder> coldhead, here is what's happening on the console
[20:15:08] <webBuilder>  SyntaxError: missing ) after condition if(jQuery(xml).find('TABLEDATA').children().size() &gt; 0)
[20:16:48] <coldhead> webBuilder: i am trying to find out where your code is actually located so i can understand who/what is changing the > into &gt;
[20:17:04] <coldhead> i have seen the error message several times now
[20:17:11] <coldhead> i am not asking about the error message
[20:17:17] <coldhead> try to understand
[20:17:32] <coldhead> i am sorry if my english is not good
[20:17:32] <coldhead> i am trying my hardest
[20:19:21] <webBuilder> located above my jsf page inside <html> <head> <script> // <!--  my script // --> </script> </head> <body></body> </html>
[20:19:50] <webBuilder> coldhead, do not be sorry, I actually I have to thank you for trying to help brother
[20:20:32] <Bonnie> can anyone give me pointers about adding a link to the jqgrid title bar?
[20:21:54] <coldhead> webBuilder: do you have a link to the page with the code?
[20:22:13] <Bonnie> There is a title on the titlebar that is specified as the caption. I need to add a href link that is aligned to the right of the title bar of this jqgrid
[20:22:18] <webBuilder> coldhead, I'm sorry I do not have it. it is on my local host
[20:22:49] <coldhead> webBuilder: and if you view the source of that page, do you see > and not &gt; ?
[20:23:22] <webBuilder> &gt;
[20:23:30] <coldhead> so that is not jQuery doing that
[20:23:36] <sinusss> http://pastie.org/4894575 how would i get errors? data.errors and data['errors'] says it's undefined.
[20:23:38] <coldhead> it must be something on your webserver
[20:23:55] <webBuilder> coldhead, head then who is it. and ow can I can overcome problem like this
[20:24:21] <coldhead> webBuilder: i would try moving the Javascript into my_file.js and serving that from the server
[20:24:41] <coldhead> see if the > is preserved that way
[20:24:54] <webBuilder> I try to do return "<img src='http://localhost:8080/users/1/5/thumb_/3D23yIdW.jpg' />" its keep generating &quot;
[20:25:10] <webBuilder> coldhead, it's keep change " to &quot;
[20:25:14] <webBuilder> it's so frustrating
[20:25:26] <coldhead> webBuilder: are you using .html() ?
[20:25:32] <coldhead> or text() ?
[20:25:36] <webBuilder> coldhead,  I did try to use it but didn't work
[20:25:41] <webBuilder> or I do not know how to use it :(
[20:26:37] <webBuilder> coldhead, I did return jQuery('myid').html("<img src='http://localhost:8080/users/1/5/thumb_/3D23yIdW.jpg' />"); it keeps converting to &quot;
[20:26:51] <webBuilder> coldhead, maybe you are right I should move it to the server just to see what would happend
[20:27:00] <webBuilder> I have been working on this for 2 days
[20:27:06] <webBuilder> not finding any solution.
[20:28:16] <coldhead> webBuilder: http://jsfiddle.net/W8Svu/
[20:29:23] <webBuilder> Thank you coldhead head I try that on jsfiddle it works
[20:29:27] <webBuilder> on my machine does not work
[20:31:15] <coldhead> sinusss: http://jsfiddle.net/DepV4/
[20:31:17] <coldhead> that works for me

[21:06:31] <pensive612> JohnnyHooks, I remember reading about almost exactly that.  trying to remember where I saw it.
[21:06:34] <pensive612> gimme a sec.
[21:07:02] <JohnnyHooks> thanks pensive
[21:10:33] <pensive612> can't seem to find it.  but if i do.  i'll post.
[21:10:43] <pensive612> in the meantime, this is about as straight forward as it should be:
[21:10:43] <pensive612> http://blog.aldomatic.com/facebook-style-slide-out-menu-in-jquery-mobile//
[21:11:06] <pensive612> just make sure to update the live() method as it is deprecated.
[21:52:25] <coldhead> free love
[21:55:25] <initself> i'll take it!

[22:01:55] <solifugus> Anyone: this .load() does not wait for the request to return before executing the function: $( '#agent_response' ).load( converse_uri, '', processAgentResponse() );
[22:02:31] <phiz> how does one deal with .load() content that has a 302?
[22:02:50] <coldhead> solifugus: remove the ()
[22:03:07] <coldhead> you want to pass the function directily, not whatever that function returns when you call it immediately
[22:03:23] <coldhead> ..., processAgentResponse);
[22:03:45] <coldhead> phiz: doesn't the redirect happen invisibly for you?
[22:03:48] <solifugus> coldhead, that worked...  would you mind telling me why?
[22:04:34] <coldhead> ?eval alert
[22:04:37] <bot-t> coldhead: <function () fns.apply.call(Print, this, arguments)>
[22:04:40] <coldhead> ?eval alert()
[22:04:41] <bot-t> coldhead: No output.
[22:04:57] <coldhead> without the parans you are just passing a reference to the function for jQuery to use later
[22:05:15] <coldhead> with the parens you are calling the function immediately, and jQuery will try to use whatever it returns as the actual callback
[22:05:23] <coldhead> which isn't usually what you want
[22:05:44] <coldhead> you're saying to jQuery "here is the function to call" instead of saying "i am calling this function right bloody now"
[22:07:37] <shoky> GOOD ON YA, coldhead, but.
[22:08:22] <Fid> hello! how use use smarty tags in jquery's scripts?
[22:22:32] <AlbinoGeek> Hey there, any WYSIWYG editors that can inline PHP nicely?  ie: a way the user can edit/ otherwise see PHP blocks inside the HTML they are editing?
[22:22:44] <AlbinoGeek> I have this: http://96.48.104.22:1337/pokerbet.com/cms/update/reviews%255Cpokerstars but you can see the PHP code at the top of the file messes up the editor.
[22:44:26] <initself> does this need single parens? $(selector, this.id).html(total);
[22:44:43] <initself> single quote, sorry
[22:45:13] <coldhead> initself: you probably don't need the .id
[22:45:19] <coldhead> just $(selector, this)
[22:45:21] <coldhead> usually suffices
[22:45:24] <coldhead> if this is a dom node
[22:45:28] <initself> hrm
[22:45:53] <initself> no luck there
[22:46:07] <initself> my selector is td.total
[22:46:26] <initself> the .each loop will give me each one
[22:46:27] <coldhead> and is this a parent of that td?
[22:46:36] <coldhead> or are you trying to do something else and i've misunderstood
[22:46:46] <initself> ah!
[22:46:53] <initself> I think I just need this.
[22:46:55] * initself tries.
[22:47:01] <coldhead> good luck
[22:47:39] <initself> hrm, still not sure
[22:48:30] <initself> $(this).html(total); has the same result as $(selector).html(total);
[22:48:36] <initself> selector is 'td.total'
[22:48:45] <initself> each loops through each one
[22:48:49] <initself> giving me this
[22:49:10] <initself> but i have to specifically update the right total
[22:49:30] <initself> hard to explain
[22:49:34] <initself> maybe a fiddle
[22:49:35] <coldhead> you can see if this matches the selector with $(this).is('td.total')
[22:49:42] <coldhead> that returns true or false
[22:49:46] <coldhead> just FYI
[22:50:23] <initself> console.log($(this).is('td.total'));
[22:50:25] <initself> true three times
[22:50:33] <coldhead> loopy
[22:51:40] <initself> seems to me like this.html should only be pointing to one of the three at a time
[22:51:47] <coldhead> it should
[22:51:56] <coldhead> this is only ever a single thing
[22:52:03] <coldhead> unless something has gone horribly horribly wrong
[22:52:08] <coldhead> by all means let's see the fiddle
[22:52:17] <initself> ya, tring
[22:54:30] <initself> thar she blows: http://jsfiddle.net/kgt6a/3/
[22:58:02] <initself> this.id definitely refers to the right thing
[22:58:16] <initself> so it shouldn't be totalling some other column
[22:59:08] <coldhead> initself: http://jsfiddle.net/kgt6a/4/
[22:59:15] <coldhead> your index() calculation was bogus
[22:59:31] <coldhead> i just used straightindex() without the sibling() stuff and i see different totals now
[22:59:46] <coldhead> straight index()*
[22:59:57] <initself> ya, man, seriously!
[23:00:01] <initself> dammit
[23:00:09] <coldhead> aw y u grim
[23:00:16] <coldhead> this worked out great!
[23:00:21] <initself> "learning this the hard way" by initself
[23:00:27] <initself> NOW ON KINDLE
[23:00:28] <phiz> coldhead: earlier you mentioned i could do console.log(arguments) how do i know arguments is available
[23:00:42] <coldhead> it's provided by JS to every function, phiz
[23:00:55] <initself> coldhead++
[23:00:55] <coldhead> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments
[23:01:11] <initself> what kind of fanciness might you recommend for dealing with the float vs int issue i am not facing?
[23:01:36] <coldhead> initself: parseFloat() to always cast to a float?
[23:01:40] <sigurding> anyone here did some projects with angularJS?
[23:01:49] <phiz> coldhead: cool that's what what i was looking for thanks for the url
[23:01:55] <initself> coldhead: these counts shouldn't be casting to a float
[23:01:59] <initself> they are ints
[23:02:05] <coldhead> oh then parseInt() for those guys
[23:02:18] <initself> ya, so what fanciness to i use to determine which one to use?
[23:02:22] <coldhead> maybe add some metadata to the td
[23:02:29] <initself> ya, like, data-myshit?
[23:02:36] <coldhead> <td class="total" data-format="int">
[23:02:41] <initself> good times
[23:02:46] <coldhead> and then if ($this).data('format') === 'int')
[23:02:51] <initself> better times
[23:02:55] <coldhead> except typed better, obvs
[23:04:11] <coldhead> phiz: if you google for mdc and some_keyword you can almost always find the excellent mozilla docs for whatever JS thing you're looking at
[23:08:20] <phiz> coldhead: cool thank-you
[23:08:48] <initself> coldhead: if you were going to pass decimal points using data-x, what would you call x?
[23:11:36] <phiz> coldhead: regarding the previous question, my issue is i don't want the redirect
[23:12:01] <phiz> in my case the page is redirecting to an authentication page, so i want to catch the 302 and display an error
[23:12:15] <noregret> how i select a checked radio btton and get its value
[23:13:07] <initself> shit, seems you can't add numbers without casting
[23:15:31] <coldhead> initself: data-precision
[23:15:34] <coldhead> is what i'd call it
[23:15:41] <initself> coldhead++ #bingo
[23:15:42] <coldhead> phiz: i don't believe you can trap 302s in jQuery
[23:15:46] <_Tristan> is there a non-hacky way to get an empty jquery object? I'm using $('__nothing') but it
[23:15:49] <_Tristan> it's.. hacky
[23:15:59] <coldhead> noregret: $(':checked').val()
[23:16:22] <coldhead> _Tristan: i use $() or $('')
[23:16:52] <noregret> coldhead: what if there were several radio groups, and i want the selected one from a certain group
[23:16:56] <_Tristan> coldhead: thanks
[23:18:55] <noregret> coldhead: it would be just $('.grp1 :checked').val() ?
[23:19:14] <coldhead> looks good to me, noregret!
[23:19:31] <initself> ok, i've got my totals on the bottom of the table
[23:19:44] <coldhead> ?cc
[23:19:44] <initself> but then i've got another total section at the top of my page in a <p>
[23:19:44] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[23:19:50] <initself> NOT YET
[23:19:54] <coldhead> oh god
[23:19:57] <coldhead> it never ends
[23:19:57] <initself> OH DEAR
[23:20:03] <initself> it's SO CLOSE
[23:20:05] <phiz> coldhead: is there a work around?
[23:20:10] <initself> just a small detail
[23:20:29] <initself> i can set: id="merch_amount_total"
[23:20:45] <initself> but then i can't really use that again as <p id="merch_amount_total">
[23:20:48] <initself> so what should i do instead?
[23:21:09] <initself> <td id="merch_amount_total"> >> <p id="merch_amount_total">
[23:21:12] <coldhead> are they in the same columns as the totals at the bottom?
[23:21:14] <initself> is the answer "use a class"?
[23:21:20] <coldhead> yes, use a class
[23:21:24] <initself> coldhead: it's stand alone data
[23:21:25] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take 5
[23:21:28] <initself> hahahah
[23:21:29] <coldhead> gotcha
[23:21:43] <initself> you are fucking funny man
[23:21:50] <initself> you are probably the funniest person i have ever seen on irc
[23:21:55] <initself> since 2005
[23:22:44] <coldhead> you're too kind
[23:23:07] <initself> coldhead++ # killin' em with kindness
[23:23:29] <initself> hrmf
[23:23:43] <initself> i can't say this.class, since there's 3 selectors
[23:23:54] <initself> i could say this.id, if i wasn't bound to one id to rule them all
[23:24:02] <initself> so wtf do i do now?
[23:24:11] <initself> data-?
[23:24:18] <initself> ?data-
[23:24:20] <initself> ?data
[23:24:20] <bot-t> initself, .data() - Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[23:24:21] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[23:24:37] <initself> not convinced, bot-t!
[23:25:04] <initself> ah, maybe an id selector that applies to a class of the same name!?
[23:25:37] <coldhead> data-update-class="merch_total"; var selector = $(this).data('update-class'); $(selector).html(total)'
[23:25:42] <coldhead> something like that?
[23:25:57] <initself> what do you think of my novel idea, tho?
[23:26:07] <coldhead> what i understand of it scares me
[23:26:12] <coldhead> no that's a neat fix
[23:26:12] <initself> bummer
[23:26:14] <coldhead> go for that
[23:26:18] <initself> orly?
[23:26:20] <coldhead> it's elegant
[23:26:30] <initself> see, now maybe you are just playing with me
[23:26:34] <initself> how can i trust you?
[23:26:43] <mazzachre> coldhead, that could be nice...
[23:26:46] <initself> this is where being funny has its limit.
[23:27:15] * initself tries, against his better judgement.
[23:27:24] <coldhead> is it a limit or is it a call to arms for making your own mind up?
[23:28:39] <AdamPDotty> Aux Armes?
[23:29:00] <initself> if i learned anything today, it is that my mind is ok!
[23:29:13] * AdamPDotty boggles mind
[23:29:19] <initself> ....and....that failed.
[23:29:32] <initself> what says you, oh might console.log?
[23:29:51] <coldhead> you might be missing a . or a #, initself?
[23:29:59] <initself> $('span.' + $(this).id ).html(total);
[23:30:08] <initself> look stupid?
[23:30:33] <coldhead> no that looks okay
[23:30:40] <AdamPDotty> tbh ..
[23:31:02] <coldhead> console.log('span.' + $(this).id) just to check?
[23:31:09] <AdamPDotty> this.id should do, right?
[23:31:39] <initself> span.undefined
[23:31:45] <AdamPDotty> id of a set doesnt really make sense
[23:31:46] <coldhead> bam
[23:32:02] <initself> however!
[23:32:04] <initself> this.id works!
[23:32:09] <initself> ID OF A SET
[23:32:16] <initself> YOU ARE BAD.
[23:32:22] <coldhead> it may be that you are within an each() loop where this has been given a new value?
[23:32:23] <initself> AdamDPotty++
[23:32:27] <coldhead> in which case maybe save the ID sooner
[23:32:31] <initself> coldhead: yes!
[23:32:37] <coldhead> and use the saved var later when you need it
[23:32:47] * AdamPDotty *born to consufe*
[23:33:09] <initself> hooray!!!!!

[23:44:21] <anli_> Is it possible to use onchange in a <input type="file"> in ie?
[23:44:40] <anli_> What I want is to upload a file using ajax instead of posting a <form>
[23:46:29] <coldhead> anli_: it might be much simpler to use something like https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[23:46:35] <coldhead> rather than reinvent all the wheels yourself
