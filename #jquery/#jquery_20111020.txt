[00:26:51] <damagednoob> sorry if this is a dumb question, but i recently upgraded from jquery 1.3.2 to jquery 1.6.4 and it seems like the success callbacks of $.post have a javascript object parameter as opposed to json
[00:27:05] <intellilogic> On my page http://portfolioonfire.com  I have a file AJ2_Sample.js  which has a  .live('click', function(event){  That I can't seem to get working(not firing anything on click of the selector), it works with the normal method of .click  Yes I know on THIS page I don't NEED  .live, but I do on other pages, I am trying to get it working here first.  HELP!?!?
[00:27:26] <damagednoob> i get a hint of this in the documentation (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/) but it seems to depend
[00:30:44] <stringent> intellilogic: you've got function(event) then are calling e.preventDefault();
[00:30:52] <stringent> try event.preventDefault();
[00:32:52] <intellilogic> stringent: ahh
[00:33:35] <stringent> damagednoob: i don't quite get what you're asking, i don't know how 1.3 worked
[00:34:24] <intellilogic> stringent: Sweet, thanks for noticing that, I would have never figured it out, once you get your mind thinking its one thing, you can't see the simple stuff, haha.
[00:34:31] <damagednoob> stringent, i had 1.3.2 code that made a $.post and in the success callback i used json2.js to parse the data and get javascript object
[00:35:01] <damagednoob> i just upgraded to 1.6.4 and it seems like i don't need the json2.js step anymore
[00:35:18] <stringent> hmm, looks like it from the docs
[00:35:21] <stringent> vOv
[00:35:50] <damagednoob> is that from reading the examples?
[00:36:15] <stringent> can you post some code?
[00:37:51] <damagednoob> can't at the moment because i'm not at work, will do later when i have the code in front of me
[00:38:08] <stringent> the post returns a json string?
[00:38:46] <stringent> ah well
[00:50:19] <nir0> guys
[00:50:30] <nir0> is there "clock slider"?
[00:50:39] <nir0> so user sees the clock
[00:51:19] <nir0> and can drag the sign to another time
[00:51:31] <nir0> clock i mean analog
[01:08:21] <SinnerNyx> is it possible that one of my functions are being called while it's run? the function is an event handler, could it be that the event is being triggered, and executed while the function is still running?
[01:16:03] <etcha^> help needed, i have an index.php, which contains two iframes, menu.php and body.php, both have an id, i want to show a hidden table layer in body.php on top when a menu item is clicked from menu.php, is there an easier way to access frames in query?
[01:16:17] <etcha^> and which file does the jquery go in
[01:16:30] <etcha^> index.php, menu.php or body.php
[01:16:56] <photosbyme> hey all, need a little help with this script, it works  in all browsers but IE8
[01:25:25] <photosbyme> http://jsfiddle.net/photosbyseun/t6aES/    if anyone can help?
[01:27:19] <Shisma> hi
[01:28:15] <Shisma> how can i check if one element is inside of an another element?
[01:28:37] <PERECil> $( element ).find( element ).length > 0
[01:29:08] <ajpiano> Shisma: jQuery.contains
[01:29:15] <ajpiano> ?jQuery.contains
[01:29:16] <bot-t> jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[01:29:21] <ajpiano> pass two dom elements
[01:34:32] <SinnerNyx> chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/E2hWF/
[01:34:37] <SinnerNyx> works in IE9, fails in Chrome
[01:34:55] <SinnerNyx> in teh first load the image width comes up correctly
[01:35:11] <SinnerNyx> if you click on the image it reloads it. these subsequent reloads give a width of 0
[01:35:14] <SinnerNyx> why?
[01:36:43] <Nir-PHP> good morning. is there a way to add some kind of code right after <body> (even thou code was already written)... ? (and without using hidden span with span.html()...)
[01:37:28] <SinnerNyx> Nir-PHP: like $(document.body).prepend('code')?
[01:38:09] <blackspotwiggins> "right after" means prepend. ok.
[01:38:25] <SinnerNyx> blackspotwiggins: am i wrong?
[01:38:35] <SinnerNyx> he meant the opening body tag i believe
[01:39:08] <Nir-PHP> lets assume i have: <body><div>bla bla</div></body>
[01:39:10] <blackspotwiggins> it's impossible to tell what he meant, but i assumed after <body> means after the element..
[01:39:20] <Nir-PHP> i would like... even thou i have code already written... to add some kind of div right after the <body><
[01:39:52] <SinnerNyx> Nir-PHP: in your example would you want <body>newcode<div>bla bla</div></body>
[01:40:02] <Nir-PHP> yes
[01:40:06] <SinnerNyx> or <body><div>bla bla</div></body>newcode
[01:40:12] <Nir-PHP> first one :)
[01:40:12] <Tobbi> Is there a way to fire an event once a DOM property has changed?
[01:40:13] <SinnerNyx> then try my code
[01:40:20] <Nir-PHP> i will. thank you
[01:40:29] <SinnerNyx> chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/E2hWF/3/
[01:40:56] <SinnerNyx> works in IE9, fails in chrome. the first load the width is right, but if you click on the image, it will reload it and the width comes up zero...
[01:41:16] <SinnerNyx> Nir-PHP: no worries
[01:43:55] <photosbyme> again any ideas can anyone help
[01:44:28] <Aamir> ?ask @photosbyme
[01:44:28] <bot-t> photosbyme, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:45:56] <photosbyme> yes I have asked up above? The code works fine in all over browsers other than IE8, it loads the gallery at the bottom but the gallery breaks at the top
[01:46:16] <photosbyme> not sure what you mean by asking
[01:47:20] <notbenh1> ok I'm a bit stumped on this one. I have a click() handler attached to an <li>, with in each is a div with an image. When clicking though it's the image that is the event.target. I know that I can use closest to crawl back up to the <li> but I'm curious on why the target is not what I expect?
[01:47:57] <xec> photosbyme: do you have a live demo?
[01:48:36] <photosbyme> yes, thanks XEC - www.exitsstageleft.com
[01:48:40] <azorai> The target will be whatever the user clicks on. If the user clicks on the <img> then why are you surprised?
[01:50:10] <Aamir> SinnerNyx:  http://jsfiddle.net/E2hWF/4/
[01:51:46] <notbenh1> azorai: I think the things that's confusing is why the event for the parent is triggered though reported by the child? If the event handler knows what event to trap, why does it not default the context to the parent?
[01:52:53] <xec> photosbyme: where is your code calling the plugin?
[01:53:16] <xec> photosbyme: i have to go, maybe take a look here: http://galleria.aino.se/docs/1.2/getting_started/quick_start/
[01:53:19] <Aamir> photosbyme:  is it just IE8? the link you provide has the problem in IE8 I mean?
[01:54:07] <photosbyme> Aamir: yes just IE8 - it even works in Opera (which usually gives me issues :) )
[01:54:34] <alekwisnia> hi, I use jQuery function .toggle() to hide and tbody-s in my table. It works fine under Chrome, but when I try Firefox it behaves the strange way - it looks like it tries to "toggle" all tbody's children, is this a bug?
[01:55:05] <photosbyme> xec, the code is called in the body - I also specified the code to be called in the head for IE8 that didn't work either
[01:55:07] <Aamir> ?demo @alekwisnia
[01:55:30] <Darsain> explain this to me: http://jsfiddle.net/pNCP8/ ... is it a correct behaviour? if so, why?
[01:56:31] <xec> photosbyme: jsfiddle.net/photosbyseun/t6aES/ <-- what is this code supposed to do?
[01:56:47] <azorai> notbenh1, that's just the nature of the events API and event bubbling. When you listen for an event on an element, what you're actually listening for is events that init on that element AND elements that bubble up from descendent elements.
[01:57:06] <Aamir> Darsain:  got question :P
[01:57:10] <azorai> *I mean "AND events that bubble..."
[01:57:30] <photosbyme> loads the images dynamically from the image folder so as one only needs to adds images to the file not the html
[01:58:21] <photosbyme> i think its the way IE8 reads the Jquery
[01:58:38] <notbenh1> azorai: ahh that makes sence, just not what I was expecting. Thanks for setting me straight.
[01:58:39] <azorai> photosbyme, what is $('#gallery').append($('img src')); supposed to do?
[01:59:19] <xec> indeed, the "img src"  looks confusing at best
[01:59:53] <Aamir> photosbyme:  here we go http://gyazo.com/e5bccfacc29df065db71fe8bbad4df73
[02:00:50] <photosbyme> it stops the gallery picking up images in the site and adding it to the gallery - have a look at the site if possible : www.exitsstageleft.com there is an image line which before $('#gallery').append($('img src')); would be added to the whole gallery - hope that makes sense
[02:01:24] <xec> i think he's changing the code on the page as we speak
[02:02:21] <Aamir> photosbyme:  IE8 is not loading <script src="galleria/galleria-1.2.5.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[02:03:08] <xec> Aamir: it is here
[02:03:40] <Darsain> none can explain my problem? because it is pissing me off. I'll have to rewrite the data handling because of it :/ ... ohwell, I gues I'll have to rewrite it anyway. and I wanted to have a nice data namespacing :/
[02:04:17] <photosbyme> Aamir it loads right at the bottom  - can't see all of the image link
[02:04:24] <azorai> Darsain, sorry could u repeat the issue u're having pls.
[02:04:34] <Darsain> azorai: http://jsfiddle.net/pNCP8/
[02:05:59] <Aamir> Darsain:  http://jsfiddle.net/pNCP8/1/
[02:06:05] <Aamir> cc @azorai
[02:07:05] <Darsain> Aamir: o.O why doesn't it work properly with div.data(...) ?
[02:07:33] <Aamir> Darsain:  I don't know but I fixed it after reading the jQuery docs :P
[02:07:36] <Aamir> ?data
[02:07:53] <Aamir> bot-t is dead again :/
[02:09:45] <azorai> Aamir, just looked at the source for $.fn.data ... I have no idea why it's breaking up the name ... Do u know why?
[02:09:59] <Aamir> nups
[02:11:32] <azorai> Ahh.. Of course, $.fn.data, treats what we think is a namespace like a CSS class. So e.g. div.data('foo.app') .. defines foo under class of app and div.removeData('.app') will remove that. Strange I think.
[02:12:44] <azorai> nm ..
[02:12:46] <azorai> I have no idea.
[02:12:48] <azorai> WTF jquery
[02:13:05] <photosbyme> oh well screw IE users
[02:17:35] <alekwisnia> hi, I use jQuery function .toggle() to hide and tbody-s in my table. It works fine under Chrome, but when I try Firefox it behaves the strange way - it looks like it tries to "toggle" all tbody's children, is this a bug? Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/9vhvc/3/ , the more columns, the worse
[02:28:55] <Aamir> ?down jsfiddle.net
[02:29:02] <bot-t> Aamir, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[02:30:02] <Aamir> alekwisnia:  your demo works the same way in both Chrome and FF
[02:32:28] <Aamir> alekwisnia:  http://jsfiddle.net/9vhvc/4/
[02:34:29] <alekwisnia> Aamir: what I mean is that it slides tbody to the corner
[02:34:50] <alekwisnia> what I need is to slide tbody down from the blue belt
[02:38:23] <Scorchin> When running an $.ajax() query against an HTTP Auth url (with username and pass provided), Firefox shows a username/password popup. Is there any way to prevent this from occurring?
[02:38:54] <Aamir> alekwisnia:  there should be only one tbody in a table
[02:40:01] <aw_> aw
[02:41:07] <Aamir> alekwisnia: sorry I was wrong
[02:41:42] <Aamir> not sure what r u trying but may be you need to give a fixed width to the tbody
[02:42:36] <alekwisnia> Aamir: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#edef-TBODY ok, I'll try with width 100%
[02:45:02] <mick_laptop> what is the difference between these attribute filters: [attribute*=value] and [attribute=value]
[02:45:56] <Aamir> ?Attribute Contains Selector @mick_laptop
[02:46:46] <mick_laptop> was i supposed to be /msg'ed by a bot?
[02:46:55] <mick_laptop> nothing happened
[02:47:10] <Aamir> mick_laptop:  attribute=value for exact value match, attribute*=value is when attribute contains a value
[02:47:16] <SoulRaven> any ideea whay, when i refresh a div, with a table that contanins dataTables plugin, the styles are not applied?
[02:47:20] <Aamir> mick_laptop:  http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[02:47:21] <mick_laptop> ah ok
[02:47:27] <mick_laptop> i get it
[02:47:42] <SoulRaven> for refresh the div i use .load()
[02:48:14] <Aamir> SoulRaven:  do you re-apply dataTables plugin after .load() ?
[02:48:36] <SoulRaven> no
[02:48:47] <Aamir> SoulRaven: you need to
[02:48:57] <SoulRaven> but i have try to aplay the style, in callback of load
[02:49:01] <SoulRaven> but nothing
[02:49:23] <Aamir> wat?
[02:49:59] <Aamir> SoulRaven:  .load($(this).find('table').dataTable(….) )  something like this
[02:50:07] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/DW6sB/1/
[02:50:46] <Aamir> SoulRaven:  no you are wrong. Just re-apply the plugin the table
[02:51:14] <muszek> hi... can I select and element that has both of two classes present?  Example: I want to select all divs that have both .tree and .alive
[02:51:31] <Aamir> muszek:  $('div.class1.class2')
[02:51:41] <muszek> Aamir: thanks
[02:51:45] <Aamir> $('div.tree.alive')
[02:51:58] <muszek> it's not valid in CSS, right?
[02:52:16] <Aamir> muszek:  it is but in css IE6 won't love it
[02:52:39] <muszek> I stopped supporting it a while ago (<1% of users in my country)
[02:52:45] <muszek> IE7+ support it?
[02:52:50] <Aamir> muszek: yes
[02:52:59] <muszek> awesome
[02:57:39] <SoulRaven> Aamir: i have try like this http://jsfiddle.net/DW6sB/2/
[02:57:46] <SoulRaven> ans style not working
[02:58:35] <muzone> Can JS do its own crontab thing? Like reload an XML file every 10 minutes?
[02:59:27] <Aamir> SoulRaven: oh GoD, no its like   $('#livestat').load(baseURL + '/Telemetrics/livestats', function(){  $(this).find('table').dataTable({..})  })
[02:59:32] <Aamir> ?load
[03:00:03] <Aamir> SoulRaven: use load callback
[03:00:18] <Aamir> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[03:03:04] <SoulRaven> Aamir: not working http://jsfiddle.net/DW6sB/3/
[03:03:06] <SoulRaven> :((
[03:03:47] <SoulRaven> the table is updated, but the dataTable not
[03:03:59] <Aamir> SoulRaven:  try $('#livestat').load(baseURL + '/Telemetrics/livestats', function(){alert($(this).find('table').length)});
[03:04:07] <Aamir> ah ok
[03:04:20] <Aamir> SoulRaven:  live example?
[03:04:45] <SoulRaven> not posibile, because i on a framework, and the data is on DB
[03:05:08] <Aamir> SoulRaven:  try above code to make sure you got the table
[03:05:42] <SoulRaven> nope, return 0
[03:05:57] <Aamir> SoulRaven: here we go
[03:06:31] <SoulRaven> if i remove find('table') i gut 1
[03:06:36] <SoulRaven> @got
[03:06:48] <Aamir> SoulRaven: wat?
[03:06:59] <SoulRaven> $('#livestat').load(baseURL + '/Telemetrics/livestats', function(){alert($(this).length)});

[03:14:04] <twan_vdp> Hello guys, I'm using the $.get() function in a " for (index in foo) " loop.
[03:14:05] <twan_vdp> Unfortunatly, it seems that inside the loop, the iterated variable stays the same
[03:14:05] <twan_vdp> (always the last or the first one ). This is the source-code. At line 15 the sectie.view property changes (say; a, b, c, d)
[03:14:05] <twan_vdp> but at line 17 is remains the same (say; a, a, a, a). Any thoughts?
[03:14:25] <twan_vdp> http://dpaste.com/637835/
[03:14:39] <phryk> I have a problem getting the jquery plugin 'supersized' to work on a site. I basically just copied one of the examples, but after the progress indicator disappears, nothing happens.
[03:15:06] <Nir-PHP> SinnerNyx, working :) thank you!
[03:15:19] <phryk> The first image is properly placed and sized, but not 'unhidden' and the other images don't appear at all.
[03:15:27] <quicksilver> twan_vdp: that's because javascript sucks
[03:15:29] <quicksilver> twan_vdp: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Closures#Creating_closures_in_loops:_A_common_mistake
[03:15:38] <phryk> So I'm left with a black box where the images should fade through…
[03:15:46] * twan_vdp reading ...
[03:18:01] <quicksilver> twan_vdp: google for "javascript for loop closure" to see a million million blog posts on this issue ;)
[03:23:09] <twan_vdp> quicksilver, Thank you very much. This is very, very usefull and clearing a lot of other stuff up.
[03:23:15] * twan_vdp goed back to Google ...
[03:23:37] <Fayde> How can I fadeIn a div when I submit a form? Have tried with many things but can manage to figure it out
[03:24:13] <twan_vdp> $('#fooform').submit(function(){ $('#bardiv').fadeIn(500); }); ?
[03:28:10] <Darsain> sooo, any jQuery dev I can talk to about .data() behaviour?
[03:28:26] <Fayde> twan_vdp: Doesnt work, already tried it
[03:28:52] <Aamir> Darsain:  this might help u http://tutorialzine.com/2010/11/jquery-data-method/
[03:28:59] <quicksilver> twan_vdp: you're welcome.
[03:31:35] <Darsain> Aamir: I know how it works, but I have a problem with .data behaving differently than $.data ... I dug in jQuery source and found that it is deliberately coded that way, and I want to know why, becase it doesn't make sence ... imo :)
[03:32:15] <Darsain> dunno if it could be considered a bug, or I should just deal with it...
[03:32:18] <Aamir> Darsain:  i think there was a security issues with element.data and advised to use $.data
[03:34:32] <Darsain> Aamir: my problem is with namespacing of data keys. if you set a key to "name.key", and it doesn't exist, .data() will return the "name" value insted of undefined, which is what I'd want it to return, and what $.data() does
[03:36:50] <Darsain> it is on the line 1705 in jQuery 1.6.4 source. simply changing that line to "return data;" will make it behave the same way how $.data() does
[03:37:20] <Darsain> what I want to know is if it is a "feature", or a bug :)
[03:37:22] <Aamir> Darsain:  if u think so than file a bug on bug tracker :)
[03:37:51] <Darsain> I'm asking here to determine if it even is a bug, or if the devs inteded it that way for some reason
[03:39:01] <Aamir> Darsain:  file a bug and see what dev says about this. the will close if it was intended to be like this
[03:39:49] <Darsain> I don't like to bother people with unnecessary bug reports, but ok
[03:40:09] <Aamir> I don't think so its unnecessary
[03:40:13] <Aamir> u have a point
[03:42:07] <quicksilver> Darsain: I have also looked in the source and found that strange thing you're talking about ;0
[03:42:32] <quicksilver> Darsain: I'm not sure if it's deliberate either; best advice seems to be to use $.data or $(object).data but not mix the two.
[03:42:44] <quicksilver> Darsain: I would definitely file a bug.
[03:42:52] <quicksilver> I noticed it last week, funnily enough.
[03:43:14] <Darsain> filing it is than
[03:43:48] <azorai> Or visit #jquery-dev...

[03:49:15] <Aamir> BlaDe^:  ready jQuery docs about ajax and look for error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[03:49:37] <Aamir> BlaDe^:  or http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[03:49:40] <{-_-\\\> Aamir: how about styles like h1 { color:red; }
[03:49:49] <{-_-\\\> they won't be removed that way
[03:49:58] <{-_-\\\> or by id
[03:50:08] <BlaDe^> {-_-\\\: set the id/class to a random string?
[03:50:37] <Aamir> {-_-\\\:  no, if you really need to than use .attr('style','cssProperty','none !important')
[03:50:38] <BlaDe^> ah actually ignore that ;)
[03:51:20] <Aamir> * element.attr('style','cssProperty:none !important')
[03:51:51] <{-_-\\\> is it cross-browser?
[03:52:23] <Aamir> {-_-\\\:  what is cross-browser?  attr('style','cssProperty:none !important') ?
[03:52:29] <{-_-\\\> yes
[03:52:34] <{-_-\\\> will it work on every browser?
[03:52:36] <Aamir> {-_-\\\:  yes
[03:52:39] <{-_-\\\> kewl
[03:52:49] <Aamir> but I recon don't use it
[03:52:52] <Aamir> :/
[03:52:53] <{-_-\\\> why?
[03:53:09] <Aamir> can't you change the css file?
[03:53:20] <Aamir> {-_-\\\:  ^
[03:53:38] <{-_-\\\> no.
[03:53:44] <{-_-\\\> it has 4000 lines.
[03:53:49] <Aamir> so?
[03:54:11] <{-_-\\\> Aamir: and i don't want to check entire website in case of breaking something
[03:54:28] <{-_-\\\> what's wrong with your approach?
[03:54:29] <juha_> why do you want to remove styles from an element?
[03:54:29] <Aamir> if u cannot edit than in ur head section, right after u include the css file, overwrite the rules u want using <style></style>
[03:54:48] <Aamir> {-_-\\\:  !important is a bad practice
[03:55:22] <Aamir> also change ur nick to something meaningful  :P
[03:55:56] <{-_-\\\> Aamir: its a face
[03:56:13] <johnathanb> Has anyone used the tablesorter pagination plugin?
[03:56:15] <Aamir> I know but … never mind :P
[03:56:18] <{-_-\\\> so, $('div.innerText > p *').attr('style','cssProperty:none !important'); - this one should remove all styles from all elements inside?
[03:56:34] <Aamir> {-_-\\\:  no
[03:56:57] <{-_-\\\> how can i do it?
[03:57:04] <johnathanb> I'm implementing it at the minute and I want the option to show all rows in a table, so what I done was check to see when the number of record dropdown was changed, if the value wasn't all it would apple the plugin.
[03:57:24] <johnathanb> But if I change it to 50, it limits to 50 but if I change back to all then everything just disappears
[03:57:39] <Aamir> {-_-\\\:  you need to do this for each css property, for example if you have h1 { border:10px solid red; } in ur css file than do $('h1').attr('style','border:none !important')
[03:58:16] <{-_-\\\> zomg
[03:58:25] <Aamir> {-_-\\\:  my advice is that add your own css file after including the css file you cannot change
[03:58:38] <Aamir> {-_-\\\: and overwrite all the css rules you want to avoid
[03:59:11] <blackspotwiggins> haha, escalating war of specificity to the extreme
[04:32:43] <Zerpy> any pro modernizr ppls here?
[04:37:19] <{-_-\\\> Zerpy: i'm pr0
[04:38:11] <Zerpy> {-_-\\\: I'm including modernizr in my site, applying <html class="no-js"> and loads the site.. But it doesn't add the classes for some reason :(
[04:41:47] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[04:42:27] <Double_Rainbow> as a developer, do you share code/technique with your other developers or do you keep everything to yourself?
[04:47:22] <iftrueelsefalse> Double_Rainbow: Its good to share techniques and discuss things with other developers, it makes you reflect on what you are doing and you might get questions you never asked yourself
[05:07:14] <jeffsmykil> given this xml file im trying to read room IDs into an array I tried a bunch of things with no success including this inside of a loop: itemIds.push(roomContainer[i].facilityContents[y].ElemId);
[05:07:43] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/rxqGUNy4
[05:08:28] <jeffsmykil> err that's the wrong line hold on
[05:08:35] <jeffsmykil> i hate traversing xml
[05:09:18] <jeffsmykil> i did like itemIds.push(room[i]).id()
[05:12:05] <jeffsmykil> i just cant figure out how to even traverse and get the id
[05:12:28] <jeffsmykil> I think antiox showed me how to push them all into an array in a fancy way once but i seem to have forgotten
[05:12:46] <drjones69> Afternoon all -(hopefully) quick query - how can one select a select of elements, but exclude elements which contain a child matching a given criteria?  - ie (in psuedo-query) - select all elements of class '.xyz' except for those elements of class '.xyz' that have a child matching '.selected'
[05:22:55] <jeffsmykil> also tried this inside of an each loop
[05:22:56] <jeffsmykil> console.log(cachedXML.find($(this).attr("id")));
[05:23:23] <codebeaker> hi, can anyone lead my reading, I can't diagnose where a AJAX request (history related, I think) for current_url?_=0123456789 (timestamp) - seems to be chrome related, and I can't trace it
[05:25:14] * jeffsmykil hates traversing XML gah
[05:25:22] * jeffsmykil stabs
[05:25:30] <NodeX> xml blows
[05:25:32] <NodeX> json ftw
[05:25:45] <jeffsmykil> yeah it can be better
[05:25:55] <jeffsmykil> i just need to find the ids of this node
[05:25:58] <jeffsmykil> BUT NOOOO
[05:27:11] <jeffsmykil> oh wait...
[05:27:14] <jeffsmykil> got em
[05:27:17] <jeffsmykil> eat that XML
[05:28:04] <krz> how can i do the following:
[05:28:05] <krz> if ($('#foobar').find('ul p.name').html('john').length&& $('#foobar').find('ul p.title').html('mr').length)
[05:28:24] <krz> if condition is true, then remove the li of this element
[05:28:35] <krz> *parent element*
[05:28:44] <NodeX> ?contains
[05:28:44] <bot-t> :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[05:28:50] <NodeX> ^ ^
[05:29:04] <jeffsmykil> oh wow each is kind of slow
[05:29:59] <krz> NodeX: that doesn't really answer my question
[05:30:15] <krz> I'm checking for 2 conditions
[05:30:31] <krz> i don't want to remove all instances of john
[05:30:43] <krz> i want to remove all instances of john and mr
[05:30:58] <NodeX> then wrap it in a selector
[05:31:13] <krz> example?
[05:31:22] <NodeX> $("#foo").find(".bar").contains('john')...
[05:31:41] <krz> and what about the other condition: mr
[05:31:53] <NodeX> you have it completely backwards
[05:32:16] <krz> btw, p.name and p.title are inside the <li> element
[05:32:23] <NodeX> you should select everything in one selector and chaeck each for the existence of john or mr and remove accordingly
[05:32:40] <krz> so i should iterate through  loop?
[05:32:48] <NodeX> you can do this too ...
[05:32:55] <jeffsmykil> does anyone that uses visual studio no how to turn the stupid line numbers on?
[05:32:59] * jeffsmykil shakes his fist
[05:33:53] <NodeX> if($('#foobar').find("ul p.name:contains('john')") && $('#foobar').find('ul p.title:contains('mr'))) { do somehting
[05:34:04] <NodeX> change the single quotes on the second if though
[05:34:20] <NodeX> if($('#foobar').find("ul p.name:contains('john')") && $('#foobar').find("ul p.title:contains('mr')")) {
[05:34:37] <NodeX> that will do somehting if both conditions match
[05:35:08] <krz> NodeX: yea, thats what i have. but what can i use with .closest('li').remove();
[05:35:24] <krz> how can i identify that particular <li> element
[05:36:37] <NodeX> it will be the parent of the last in the chain
[05:36:46] <NodeX> $('#foobar').find("ul p.name:contains('john')").parent('li');
[05:37:16] <krz> NodeX: $('#foobar').find("ul p.name:contains('john')").parent('li') finds all instances of john
[05:37:29] <NodeX> var them up ... var test_1=$('#foobar').find("ul p.name:contains('john')"); var test_2=$('#foobar').find("ul p.name:contains('john')").... if (test_1 && test_2
[05:37:40] <NodeX> Listen to what I am saying
[05:38:03] <krz> ok i guess var'ing them up makes sense
[05:38:18] <NodeX> test_1.parent('li')
[05:38:22] <NodeX> blah balh balh
[05:38:43] <krz> ok will check this way out
[05:38:46] <krz> thanks
[05:44:47] <krz> NodeX: that will still fails though
[05:45:15] <krz> test_1.parent('li').remove() will remove all occurrences of $('#foobar').find("ul p.name:contains('john')");

[06:10:23] <PlasmaHH> hi, shouldn't $("#foo:parent") select me the parent element of the one with the id foo? it is returning me some empty object instead...
[06:12:08] <jeffsmykil> When using .when is the ajax response always "response"?
[06:12:30] <jeffsmykil> PlasmaHH: what about #foo :parent
[06:12:33] <ryan_sp> hi, I'm looping through some xml, but when I do $('module').find('name').text() it gives me Introduction to Central CientsFoobazbar in this example, how can I stop this so it's just introduction to cent .. http://pastebin.com/v3GnFTCX
[06:12:58] <chrisinajar> PlasmaHH: you could always use $("#foo").parent, that's what i generally do
[06:13:14] <quicksilver> ryan_sp: $('module > name').text()
[06:13:29] <quicksilver> ryan_sp: your version matches all <name> occuring anywhere in the <module>
[06:13:29] <PlasmaHH> jeffsmykil: the same
[06:13:43] <PlasmaHH> chrisinajar: hm, my goal was to assemble the selector string elsewhere and then use it...
[06:13:45] <jeffsmykil> then use what chrisinajar said, that def works
[06:15:07] <chrisinajar> PlasmaHH: test if that works, just to make sure your dom is set up correctly to begin with, $("#foo:parent") should work.
[06:15:49] <PlasmaHH> chrisinajar: well, $("#foo").parent()  works..
[06:15:50] <jeffsmykil> chrisinajar:  you have any experience with $.when?
[06:17:06] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: nope, never used it, what are you trying to do and what goes wrong?
[06:17:42] <jeffsmykil> im just not sure how the ajax returns the data
[06:17:52] <jeffsmykil> if it is always to function (response)
[06:17:58] <jeffsmykil> or it can be anything you put in function
[06:18:05] <jeffsmykil> ie $.when(getXML()).then(function (response) {
[06:18:26] <chrisinajar> try it and see
[06:19:07] <jeffsmykil> response isn't returning anything
[06:19:13] <jeffsmykil> but im not sure why
[06:19:19] <jeffsmykil> because the wehn isnt going to the fail
[06:19:29] <chrisinajar> ah, when doesn't return the ajax data
[06:19:33] <chrisinajar> ajax does :P
[06:19:55] <jeffsmykil> but i dont need to put a return ajaxdata; in the ajax call
[06:19:57] <chrisinajar> i have a feeling you don't need to use when at all, unless you're placing multiple ajax calls in there
[06:20:02] <jeffsmykil> I am
[06:20:16] <chrisinajar> paste your code and tell me what you're tryin to do
[06:20:20] <chrisinajar> i don't have enough information
[06:21:49] <jeffsmykil> k one second
[06:22:53] <chrisinajar> PlasmaHH: you have parent backwards
[06:23:09] <PlasmaHH> chrisinajar: hm?
[06:23:14] <jeffsmykil> chrisinajar: http://pastebin.com/MiwCfTYi
[06:23:16] <chrisinajar> PlasmaHH: :parent returns a list of elements who's parent is the selection, i think you're looking for the selection's parent amiright?
[06:23:49] <jeffsmykil> oh maybe the lack of content tu[e for the first xml call
[06:24:09] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: there are so many things wrong with this
[06:24:11] <jeffsmykil> nope thats not it
[06:24:17] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: go read about variable scoping
[06:24:30] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: also please properly indent your code, it hurts to look at
[06:24:41] <jeffsmykil> ok
[06:24:45] <jeffsmykil> variable scoping i know about
[06:24:50] <jeffsmykil> what do you think is out of scope?
[06:25:10] <PlasmaHH> chrisinajar: hm, I think so, but then .parent() isnt the same as filter(":parent") ?
[06:25:17] <krz> NodeX: do you see what i mean?
[06:25:35] <jeffsmykil> chrisinajar:  and the indenting was fine until pastebin got a hold of it
[06:25:35] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: oops, scoping was me reading it wrong (due to shitty indentation), you need to return the ajax in getXML
[06:25:45] <krz> event if i var the selectors. its not enough to identify which li to remove specifically
[06:25:49] <krz> even*
[06:25:50] <chrisinajar> PlasmaHH: they are not the same, no, i just simply tested it and noticed that.
[06:25:56] <jeffsmykil> chrisinjar	i thought it did it magically?
[06:26:12] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: you probably mixed spaces and tabs
[06:26:24] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: there is no such thing as magic, stop watching willy wonka
[06:26:39] <seutje> WAT?
[06:26:42] <seutje> how can u say that
[06:26:43] <jeffsmykil> im supposed to always use spaces right?
[06:26:49] <PlasmaHH> chrisinajar: ah, ok. I guess then tehre is no way to do it with a selector?
[06:26:52] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: either or, just stick to one
[06:27:02] <chrisinajar> PlasmaHH: not sure, go google some stuff
[06:27:21] <PlasmaHH> chrisinajar: I tried, and I landed at jsons :parent ;)
[06:27:22] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: personally i like tabs
[06:27:29] <chrisinajar> PlasmaHH: read more
[06:27:32] <jeffsmykil> k give me two seconds
[06:28:08] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: anyway, you also want to use response[2] as shown in the first example on the .when documentation page
[06:28:50] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: look at that example, they're doing exactly what you want to do
[06:29:17] <chrisinajar> jeffsmykil: however, it should be noted that you don't need when at all
[06:29:45] <chrisinajar> .ajax alone can do exactly what you're trying to do here
[06:29:55] <jeffsmykil> if i dont wait for the ajax returns nothing works
[06:29:58] <jeffsmykil> thats why im using when
[06:30:02] <chrisinajar> false
[06:30:08] <chrisinajar> use success: and error:
[06:30:21] <jeffsmykil> and chain them?
[06:30:26] <chrisinajar> no
[06:30:36] <chrisinajar> go read the documentation for ajax
[06:30:44] <chrisinajar> i need to get back to work, i was taking a short irc break :P
[06:30:59] <chrisinajar> basically the contents of your then should be inside of success: instead
[06:31:08] <chrisinajar> and it'll work exactly as you want it to
[06:31:15] <chrisinajar> there are examples on .ajax, look at them
[06:31:57] <jeffsmykil> will when work, it is just overkill?  or will it not work at all?
[06:33:46] <jeffsmykil> chrisinajar: better formatting

[06:54:16] <trose> Dykotomee, okay thanks :D
[06:54:22] <Dykotomee> glauco29: I recommend using .closest() to find the actual lightbox and hiding that.
[06:54:27] <glauco29> I think that it is not working cause I am using .live()
[06:54:28] <Dykotomee> trose: np
[06:54:35] <Dykotomee> glauco29: No, should still work.
[06:54:37] <Dykotomee> Observe:
[06:54:41] <tman> does anyone happen to know if there's a way to detect if a user has turned their phone sideways in jquery?
[06:54:51] <Dykotomee> When clicking on your link, your method is called.
[06:55:03] <Dykotomee> However, the "this" in the method refers to your link.
[06:55:06] <glauco29> how can I use closest()
[06:55:17] <tman> $(window).resize isn't firing
[06:55:19] <Dykotomee> You then pass that link to closeLightbox...
[06:55:27] <Dykotomee> ...which then tries to hide it.
[06:55:29] <glauco29> I call closeLightbox function to close 2 distincts ligthbox
[06:55:59] <Dykotomee> You'd need to get the two lightboxes in the .live function, then call closeLightbox on each.
[06:56:07] <darkadept> Is there a javascript or jquery function called "launch()" ? I've been looking over the ColorBox (http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/) code and it has a call to "launch(this)" but no definition of that function.
[06:56:18] <glauco29> I would not like to pass a param
[06:56:33] <Dykotomee> Using closest, you can find the closest parent that matches the lightbox container based upon the link.
[06:56:56] <Dykotomee> For example, you could replace this with $(this).closest('.lightbox').
[06:56:59] <Dykotomee> Or something similar.
[06:57:04] <sravan> hello, good morning!
[06:57:12] <tman> hmm it is firing nm
[06:57:14] <Dykotomee> Then it would close the actual lightbox and not hide the link.
[06:57:29] <Dykotomee> glauco29: Does that make any sense?
[06:57:48] <seutje> darkadept: sure it does
[06:58:11] <kurtp> Hey guys, is adding a sortable inside an element which is sortable can't have a receive event?
[06:58:18] <trose> Dykotomee, I suppose it's perfectly fine to use setTimeout(fn(), 30000); to just have the program wait?
[06:58:29] <darkadept> seutje: really? i've been looking over jquery.colorbox.js and can't find it anywhere
[06:58:29] <Dykotomee> trose: Well, no...
[06:58:42] <Dykotomee> Oh, unless you define fn() to be something.
[06:58:42] <glauco29> Sorry Dykotomee:
[06:58:44] <Dykotomee> Then yeah.
[06:58:49] <glauco29> I wrote wrong
[06:59:04] <glauco29> But I have already solved
[06:59:09] <Dykotomee> glauco29: Cool.
[06:59:10] <seutje> darkadept: tried ctrl+f? -> http://i.imgur.com/r9EFv.png
[06:59:11] <glauco29> thank u for help
[06:59:43] <darkadept> seutje: yes i sure did. wierd ok what line is that? what version?
[07:00:01] <Dykotomee> trose: e.g.: "$.delay(function() { alert('Hello!') }, 30000);"  // broken
[07:00:06] <seutje> darkadept: u can see the URL in the screenshot...
[07:00:15] <Dykotomee> trose: e.g.: "setTimeout(function() { alert('Hello!') }, 30000);"  // works
[07:00:30] <darkadept> seutje: ok i got it. wierd i must have deleted it by accident. i redownloaded the code and there it is
[07:00:48] <ermajn> azorai: thanks
[07:00:51] <seutje> that is weird, why would u hack it?
[07:00:57] <jeffsmykil> can you refer to the index in an each loop
[07:01:10] <trose> Dykotomee, hmm I just want a loop that checks to see if a lock variable has been set to false but i want it to wait 30 sec between checking
[07:01:17] <jeffsmykil> or am i not fully understanding each
[07:01:23] <Dykotomee> Ah, then you might want a setInterval.
[07:02:15] <darkadept> seutje: accident. I must have deleted the block of text and saved it by accident.  sigh... not a good start to the day. ;-)
[07:02:22] <Dykotomee> trose: Actually, scratch that: try this...
[07:02:35] <seutje> darkadept: well, it can only get better from here on :D
[07:02:45] <darkadept> seutje: yes. and thanks!!
[07:02:48] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: yes u can

[07:02:59] <seutje> jeffsmykil: it's passed to the function
[07:03:07] <seutje> first parameter is the index
[07:03:10] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: .each( function(index, Element) )
[07:03:16] <Dykotomee> trose: http://jsfiddle.net/PNpF4/
[07:03:17] <trose> setInterval(fn(){if lock == false{break;}}, 30000); ???
[07:04:14] <Dykotomee> trose: Wow, nvm, that's so horribly broken...lol
[07:04:17] <Dykotomee> Hold on...
[07:04:26] <trose> haha
[07:04:40] <xec> aaronmcadam: just out of curiosity, what is the second argument "Element" for?
[07:04:41] <trose> maybe like.... that but interval on the recursion?
[07:04:46] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:04:55] <aaronmcadam> xec it's for the element in the iteration
[07:04:55] <azorai> xec, that's the actual DOM element at each index.
[07:05:02] <aaronmcadam> the same as "this" really
[07:05:22] <xec> ah, of course
[07:05:35] <Dykotomee> trose: http://jsfiddle.net/PNpF4/1/
[07:05:50] <Dykotomee> I completely forgot to put in the setTimeout call.
[07:05:58] <Dykotomee> This looks like it should work.
[07:06:24] <Dykotomee> You just need to make sure you can "see" myVar from inside the check's anon func.
[07:06:27] <azorai> Dyktomee, `var fn = fn;` is kinda redundant.
[07:06:38] <Dykotomee> azorai: No, you need it for the closure.
[07:06:41] <seutje> why don't u use a setInterval and clearInterval when it matches?
[07:06:50] <Dykotomee> seutje: Yeah, you could do it that way too.
[07:07:00] <azorai> Dykotomee, no u don't.
[07:07:07] <Dykotomee> azorai: Hm? Really?
[07:07:17] <Dykotomee> Why?
[07:07:45] <azorai> Dykotomee, passing an arg is the same as declaring a local var (mostly). fn is already being passed as an argument, so is already a local var. No need to redeclare.
[07:07:56] <Dykotomee> No kidding, that's cool!
[07:08:13] <Dykotomee> Still learning closures and all.
[07:08:17] <azorai> :)
[07:08:23] <seutje> (function(a) {})() is the same as (function() { var a; })()
[07:08:35] <Dykotomee> Ah, I see.
[07:08:53] <Dykotomee> Say, can anyone look at this for a second? http://jsfiddle.net/wATyM/
[07:09:03] <Dykotomee> Line 19 is screwy.
[07:09:09] <aaronmcadam> um
[07:09:22] <Dykotomee> Erm..."$images.add($cacheImage);"+
[07:09:27] <aaronmcadam> (function(a) { // a === b })(b)
[07:09:34] <Dykotomee> s/\+//
[07:10:04] <Aamir> Dykotomee: try var $images = $([]);  not var $images = $();
[07:10:12] <Aamir> and than use .add
[07:10:44] <aaronmcadam> creating an empty dom array?
[07:10:50] <aaronmcadam> does that even make sense
[07:11:01] <Dykotomee> Aamir: Nope, same result.
[07:11:08] <Dykotomee> aaronmcadam: Yeah.
[07:11:21] <aaronmcadam> what's the point
[07:11:22] <Dykotomee> It does, as I'm planning on pushing elements onto it.
[07:11:28] <{-_-\\\> is it possible to do stuff on div size change?
[07:11:38] <aaronmcadam> no I mean does that wrapped array literal work
[07:11:45] <sravan> Is there a plugin  to import a Wikipedia Page
[07:11:48] <{-_-\\\> i.e. $('#div').sizeChange(function(){stuff();});
[07:12:06] <aaronmcadam> it's just an empty jq
[07:12:07] <Aamir> Dykotomee:  try http://engineeredweb.com/blog/09/12/preloading-images-jquery-and-javascript
[07:12:15] <aaronmcadam> with length 0
[07:12:31] <blackspotwiggins> {-_-\\\, there are two ways a div can change it's size - either through window resize, there is resize event for that
[07:12:32] <Dykotomee> aaronmcadam: Just tried "$([]).add($('<img />'))" and it worked as expected.
[07:12:37] <azorai> Dykotomee, try this on for size: http://jsfiddle.net/wATyM/1/
[07:12:48] <blackspotwiggins> or you are resizing it yourself, in which case just call whatever you want after you resize it
[07:12:51] <Aamir> ?jquery resize plugin by ben_alman @ {-_-\\\
[07:12:53] <bot-t> {-_-\\\, .resize() - Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[07:13:01] <Aamir> eh
[07:13:08] <Aamir> {-_-\\\:  http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[07:13:15] <azorai> Aamir, $([]) is equivelant to $() in all recent version of jQ
[07:13:19] <danzik171> Dykotomee: sure, but $().add('<div>') works as well.
[07:13:43] <aaronmcadam> ye
[07:13:49] <Dykotomee> azorai: Good idea, but still the same problem.
[07:13:56] <danzik171> and why even make a jquery object out of these?  are you going to modify them later?
[07:14:06] <aaronmcadam> exactly why i was confused
[07:14:26] <azorai> Dykotomee, I didn't catch what the prblm was?
[07:14:30] <Dykotomee> Perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way...
[07:14:38] <Dykotomee> Basically, I have a method called showImage.
[07:14:50] <aaronmcadam> Dykotomee: are u trying to preload images perchance
[07:14:56] <Dykotomee> This pops open a modal dialog with a centered image at 50% width & height.
[07:15:22] <Dykotomee> I need to load the image, then go back to the dialog and resize & center it according to the loaded image's dimensions.
[07:16:00] <Dykotomee> The idea was to load the image via preloadImages, then dump the image in the dialog's DOM and resize & center.
[07:16:22] <Aamir> Dykotomee: anything wrong with  http://engineeredweb.com/blog/09/12/preloading-images-jquery-and-javascript
[07:16:22] <Aamir> [14:12]
[07:16:23] <Aamir> ?
[07:16:28] <Dykotomee> I've tried that.
[07:16:32] <Dykotomee> That's where my problem occurs.
[07:16:41] <Dykotomee> I don't know why, I know that's a legit algorithm.
[07:17:42] <Dykotomee> Oh, one more thing:
[07:17:47] <aaronmcadam> Dykotomee: what about this https://gist.github.com/1301244
[07:18:01] <Dykotomee> I can't preload the image at document load because I won't know what it is until I need to show it.
[07:18:20] <aaronmcadam> ah ha
[07:18:21] <azorai> Focus on a single image. U must create the <img>, bind to its onload event, and define it's src property. Once the onload fires you want to grab the img.width and img.height and go from there.
[07:18:47] <aaronmcadam> can't u cache the dimensions on the click
[07:18:57] <{-_-\\\> is it possible to get current parent window scrolltop from within iframe?
[07:19:05] <{-_-\\\> iframe source is on different domain
[07:19:12] <blackspotwiggins> prolly no
[07:19:17] <blackspotwiggins> sop is pretty strict
[07:19:22] <{-_-\\\> zomg
[07:19:27] <azorai> {-_-\\\: nope
[07:19:29] <{-_-\\\> ok how can i display jmpopup then?
[07:19:41] <aaronmcadam> {-_-\\\: what does window.parent give u
[07:19:47] <{-_-\\\> aaronmcadam: access denied
[07:20:10] <aaronmcadam> ah
[07:20:13] <{-_-\\\> i need to display popup in window's visible area
[07:20:14] <aaronmcadam> diff domain
[07:20:35] <aaronmcadam> what are u using?
[07:20:42] <aaronmcadam> fancybox works very well for iframes
[07:20:49] <Dykotomee> azorai: I like that approach. So, I would go and use "$(myImg).bind('load', function() { /* resize & recenter */ });"?
[07:21:14] <aaronmcadam> ?tias @ Dykotomee
[07:21:14] <bot-t> Dykotomee, Try It And See
[07:21:18] <{-_-\\\> aaronmcadam: even if iframe is scrolled somewhere?
[07:21:19] <Dykotomee> lol
[07:21:22] <Dykotomee> brb
[07:21:23] <aaronmcadam> ;)
[07:21:24] <{-_-\\\> will it still display on visible area?
[07:21:36] <aaronmcadam> what is "it"
[07:21:42] <{-_-\\\> fancybox
[07:21:47] <aaronmcadam> yeah of course
[07:21:51] <aaronmcadam> you scroll within the fancybox
[07:21:53] <{-_-\\\> how does it determine scrolltop then?
[07:21:56] <{-_-\\\> aaah
[07:21:58] <{-_-\\\> i scroll
[07:22:00] <aaronmcadam> ;)
[07:22:02] <{-_-\\\> well that's how i done it now
[07:22:05] <{-_-\\\> but this sucks
[07:22:05] <aaronmcadam> yup
[07:22:20] <{-_-\\\> after user closes popup, he is scrolled to some bullshit
[07:22:27] <{-_-\\\> and he has to scroll back
[07:22:40] <{-_-\\\> any better ways?
[07:22:41] <aaronmcadam> fancybox has a parent api
[07:22:43] <Aamir> {-_-\\\:  if you an id to scrollTo than you can use url+'#elementId' as iFrame src /
[07:22:45] <Aamir> ?
[07:22:46] <miceiken> Is there a way to make an entire <li> element clickable?
[07:22:56] <miceiken> It has a <a> element inside
[07:23:02] <{-_-\\\> Aamir: i know i can scroll iframe
[07:23:03] <blackspotwiggins> everything is clickable
[07:23:06] <{-_-\\\> i don't want it to scroll
[07:23:11] <Whirl3d> good morning all. I was just asked by a friend to see the work that the experts on this channel have done and I was wondering if you all would mind sharing a link or two to demonstrate.
[07:23:14] <miceiken> yes but I want it to click the link :P
[07:23:16] <aaronmcadam> miceiken: display;block on the a
[07:23:24] <{-_-\\\> i want it to stay where it is and display popup in visible area
[07:23:34] <aaronmcadam> miceiken: CSS will fix that no js needed
[07:23:52] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, is that a plugin for jqueryies?
[07:23:54] <Aamir> mick_laptop:  $('li').css('cursor','pointer').click(function(){ $(this).find('a').click() }); :P
[07:23:56] <blackspotwiggins> where can i get it?
[07:23:56] <aaronmcadam> hahah :D
[07:24:09] <Aamir> ops
[07:24:13] <Aamir> miceiken: ^
[07:24:20] <aaronmcadam> yeah, there's this cool one called JavaScript too but you have to pay for it :(
[07:24:21] <miceiken> thanks
[07:24:22] <miceiken> got it
[07:24:22] <miceiken> :D
[07:24:40] <aaronmcadam> Aamir there's no need for that
[07:24:42] <{-_-\\\> so, any ideas?
[07:25:05] <Aamir> aaronmcadam:  i know but sometime you have other things as well inside LI not just a link
[07:25:10] <aaronmcadam> but I spose it depends on what link he wants
[07:25:16] <Aamir> like icons and stuff :P
[07:25:22] <aaronmcadam> yeah yeah
[07:25:29] <Dykotomee> woot!
[07:25:31] <aaronmcadam> but lots of people try to use js for everything
[07:25:42] <Aamir> otherwise yes, it should be done with css only
[07:25:44] <Dykotomee> azorai & aaronmcadam: Thanks! azorai's method worked!
[07:25:46] * Whirl3d brushes teeth with javascript
[07:25:58] <Aamir> miceiken:  ^ read
[07:26:14] <aaronmcadam> kk
[07:26:20] <miceiken> yeh, i did it with css
[07:26:21] <miceiken> but thanks tho
[07:26:23] <{-_-\\\> so, any ideas?
[07:26:26] <Aamir> $('teeth').brush()
[07:26:49] <aaronmcadam> teeth isn't a valid element unless ur jquerying xml? :o
[07:27:18] <{-_-\\\> its actually $('teeth tooth').brush()
[07:27:29] <blackspotwiggins> whoa inception
[07:27:32] <{-_-\\\> will be more accurate
[07:27:37] <blackspotwiggins> you have tooth in your teeth?
[07:27:42] <aaronmcadam> haha :D
[07:27:50] <aaronmcadam> if teeth is a set of tooths?
[07:27:51] <aaronmcadam> :D
[07:27:51] <Aamir> lolz
[07:27:52] <{-_-\\\> blackspotwiggins: with my variant every tooth is guaranteed to be brushed
[07:28:01] <{-_-\\\> otherwise only some can be
[07:28:04] <Whirl3d> $(".teeth").each(brush);
[07:28:09] <Aamir> aaronmcadam:  but it cannot be inside teeth :P
[07:28:22] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: implicit iteration negates that ;)
[07:28:30] <blackspotwiggins> {-_-\\\, actually only a tooth inside teeth
[07:28:39] <{-_-\\\> <teeth><tooth id="1" /><tooth id="2" />...</teeth>
[07:28:46] <aaronmcadam> maybe inside a mouth
[07:28:57] <{-_-\\\> depends on implementation
[07:29:03] <aaronmcadam> write the schema ;)
[07:29:06] <aaronmcadam> xsd:tooth
[07:29:12] <Aamir> body.find('mouth teeth')
[07:29:16] <aaronmcadam> well element maybe
[07:29:27] <Whirl3d> aaronmcadam, only if brush is defined as an extension to jquery, right?
[07:29:45] <aaronmcadam> $.fn.brush :D
[07:29:49] <blackspotwiggins> $("face").get(0).apply($("palm"))
[07:29:54] <aaronmcadam> yes Whirl3d :)
[07:29:55] <{-_-\\\> $('body head mouth teeth tooth:cracked').remove();
[07:29:59] <Whirl3d> pfew
[07:30:04] <aaronmcadam> oooh
[07:30:16] <aaronmcadam> the context of ur face is your palm blackspotwiggins ?
[07:30:40] <Whirl3d> should be if it isn't. LOL
[07:30:43] <blackspotwiggins> momentarily
[07:30:46] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[07:30:52] <aaronmcadam> contemporaneously ;D
[07:31:01] <blackspotwiggins> it highly depends on how much i pay attention to the chat here

[07:36:18] <aaronmcadam> bam drjones69 ;)
[07:36:37] <gnarf> its non-standard tho, and therefore not suggested to be used as a selector
[07:36:45] <blackspotwiggins> stribor, use .prop()
[07:36:52] <aaronmcadam> you should avoid pseudo selectors anyway
[07:37:11] <aaronmcadam> and yeah, prop for checking checkboxes
[07:37:14] <stribor> i just want to select one of the checkboxes and play with it..i am new to jquery

[07:37:58] <Peeter> I got a question about the .data() method. If I'm not using HTML5, what exactly happens? Does it use another technique ?
[07:38:20] <blackspotwiggins> it uses $.cache for storing

[07:38:48] <Peeter> $.cache?
[07:38:58] <aaronmcadam> internal?
[07:39:07] <Peeter> Ani API documents about it?
[07:39:21] <Peeter> Any*
[07:39:25] <aaronmcadam> nope Peeter it's internal
[07:40:26] <blackspotwiggins> well you can read the source

[07:45:17] <jojovem> then resize the window
[07:45:35] <jojovem> you will notice, that the bar below the product, makes strange things
[07:46:15] <jojovem> horizontal resizing
[07:47:28] <jojovem> im using jcarousellite_1.0.1.pack.js and jquery.1.3.2.min.js
[07:47:43] <jojovem> not the latest, but this bug is kinda weird
[07:47:53] <DTrejo> hey everyone: I'm trying to build a viewer for antique japanese scrolls — would anyone know of something specialized for viewing scrolls? (rather than just an image gallery type thing). I'd love something like this, http://dl.lib.brown.edu/garibaldi/panoramaFlash2011/side1.html, but no in flash!
[07:48:24] <karega|aniasis> doess jquery.ui.mouse recognize touch events now?
[07:49:29] <jojovem> aaronmcadam could yous ee the problem?
[07:50:33] <aaronmcadam> why are u using a version of jQuery from like 3 years ago?
[07:51:02] <aaronmcadam> February 20th, 2009 announced on the blog
[07:51:03] <aaronmcadam> lol
[07:51:07] <jojovem> Because the company i work on didnt have the time do upgrade it
[07:51:11] <jojovem> We use like 90 plugins
[07:51:19] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:51:25] <jojovem> If we upgrade it, we need to upgrade all 90 plugins
[07:51:30] <jojovem> that will be made later this year
[07:51:31] <aaronmcadam> sounds like a company who don't really know js then so
[07:51:45] <jojovem> We sell 2 million dollars per day
[07:51:47] <jojovem> We just cant stop
[07:51:53] <aaronmcadam> lol
[07:52:00] <jojovem> Thats funny?
[07:52:38] <DTrejo> jojovem++
[07:53:19] <jojovem> We dont have the personell or time to do that
[07:53:21] <jojovem> plz understand
[07:53:33] <jojovem> Our entire payment system runs on jquery 1.3.2
[07:53:54] <jojovem> ill have lunch see ya
[07:53:58] <Whirl3d> jojovem, don't let em get to ya
[07:54:23] <aaronmcadam> i can understand his situation
[07:54:44] <aaronmcadam> I've been trying to refactor 1700 lines of code for months now lol
[07:54:56] <aaronmcadam> nearly there on getting the team to use what i've done
[07:55:29] <Whirl3d> I'm a team of one and I can't get my team to agree to use anything consistently.
[07:55:56] <aaronmcadam> urself? :)
[07:56:27] <Whirl3d> Every time I think I am pleased with something, I get some input from this group and then, in shame, begin refactoring.
[07:56:37] <aaronmcadam> oh heh
[07:56:59] <aaronmcadam> just keep on learning
[07:57:15] <karega|aniasis> ajpiano, what happened to Paul Bakaus' jQuery ui for touch screens?
[07:57:22] <karega|aniasis> It isn't on github anymore
[07:57:23] <aaronmcadam> keep on refactoring, old code can always be improved
[07:57:30] <aaronmcadam> jquery mobile
[07:57:32] <aaronmcadam> karega
[07:57:44] <blackspotwiggins> lol, cant imagine how slow it is
[07:57:46] <blackspotwiggins> 90+ plugins
[07:57:48] <blackspotwiggins> on 1.3
[07:57:49] <aaronmcadam> it builds on top of some of the ideas of jquery ui
[07:58:01] <blackspotwiggins> that's what you get with lazy coding :D
[07:58:05] <aaronmcadam> wel
[07:58:05] <karega|aniasis> so jquery mobile supports touch?
[07:58:14] <aaronmcadam> that's what u get when people aren't skilled enough
[07:58:14] <karega|aniasis> I don't want to use jquery mobile
[07:58:15] <blackspotwiggins> karega|aniasis, yeah, should work ok
[07:58:15] <aaronmcadam> lol
[07:58:20] <aaronmcadam> karega are u trolling me
[07:58:27] <karega|aniasis> ??
[07:58:35] <blackspotwiggins> karega|aniasis, i think someone extracted the events bits from mobile
[07:58:41] <karega|aniasis> blackspotwiggins, I want to use just jquery and jquery ui
[07:58:43] <blackspotwiggins> without all the ui fluff
[07:58:43] <aaronmcadam> jquery mobile, a mobile app framework, does it support touch?
[07:59:00] <blackspotwiggins> karega|aniasis, yeah, i understand
[07:59:00] <karega|aniasis> aaronmcadam, no it did not always
[07:59:14] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:59:40] <aaronmcadam> I've been using it from early alphas, never noticed that hah
[08:00:13] <aaronmcadam> hmm anyway, a touch library would help u
[08:00:45] <aaronmcadam> karega have u tried xui
[08:00:56] <aaronmcadam> a jquery-like library for mobile
[08:00:59] <karega|aniasis> aaronmcadam, excuse I'm sorry.  I meant to be more specific.  jQuery mobile didn't support sortables and draggable
[08:01:05] <aaronmcadam> karega|aniasis:
[08:01:06] <aaronmcadam> http://xuijs.com/
[08:01:18] <aaronmcadam> not yet anyway
[08:01:24] <aaronmcadam> but lots of widgets are done
[08:01:37] <karega|aniasis> aaronmcadam, and I don't like using alot of frameworks to do rudimentary stuff.  bloats your app
[08:01:39] <aaronmcadam> you could ask in #jquerymobile-dev
[08:01:48] <aaronmcadam> xui is tiny that's why people use it
[08:01:58] <aaronmcadam> you'd need a lib to normalise ur touch events
[08:01:58] <karega|aniasis> thanks
[08:02:06] <aaronmcadam> unless they'll work fine
[08:02:12] <aaronmcadam> have u tried just binding to a touch event?
[08:02:21] <karega|aniasis> I will look at in the future
[08:02:30] <aaronmcadam> in jqm click is an analog to touch anyway
[08:02:40] <aaronmcadam> there are *lots* of issues with touch events
[08:02:56] <karega|aniasis> aaronmcadam, I think you are missing the point of what I am trying to do.  I am not trying to target touch screens only support them
[08:02:59] <aaronmcadam> trying to do it all vanilla might be a lot of work
[08:03:04] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[08:03:16] <aaronmcadam> ok
[08:03:21] <Hornet> having an 'interesting' issue with an event handler running twice, anyone able to assist?
[08:03:21] <aaronmcadam> then clicks will just work karega
[08:03:28] <Hornet> event is halted, yet still runs
[08:03:29] <aaronmcadam> handler bound twice?
[08:03:31] <karega|aniasis> aaronmcadam, I am fine I was just looking for the github for the project
[08:03:32] <aaronmcadam> search ur source
[08:03:39] <Hornet> it's not bound twice
[08:03:50] <Hornet> nor is it bubbling
[08:03:51] <aaronmcadam> ah i gotcha
[08:03:53] <Hornet> or shouldn't be
[08:03:55] <karega|aniasis> aaronmcadam, clicks won't work.  As I said I am using jQuery ui draggable
[08:04:09] <aaronmcadam> so it's jqui that doesn't support it
[08:04:25] <karega|aniasis> yes
[08:04:37] <karega|aniasis> ok thanks for your time and effort
[08:04:40] <aaronmcadam> right
[08:04:44] <blackspotwiggins> i think draggable uses mouse events, not touch ones
[08:04:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah but click will work the same most times blackspotwiggins
[08:05:08] <aaronmcadam> it must be the "tap and hold" action that's fuckin up
[08:05:09] <blackspotwiggins> click should work yea
[08:05:18] <aaronmcadam> as in"click and drag"
[08:05:19] <blackspotwiggins> it's the most universal event ever
[08:05:28] <aaronmcadam> also, there's a delay in the click being fired
[08:05:32] <aaronmcadam> i bet that's why it won't work
[08:06:07] <aaronmcadam> across all mobile browsers, there's a delay on the click because u might not mean to tap a link
[08:06:20] <aaronmcadam> u could have just swiped over it or anything
[08:06:36] <Hornet> http://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat/mobile/showselect <-- can anyone see why event is running twice? click a row to see two console.logs from seperate halfs of a function that should run once
[08:06:38] <aaronmcadam> i bet that's why the jq draggable doesn't work
[08:07:01] <aaronmcadam> Hornet: are u binding events in an ajax callback perchance?
[08:07:45] <Hornet> no
[08:08:10] <aaronmcadam> Hornet you're just using jquery yeah, no other libs?
[08:08:14] <karega|aniasis> anyone in here with jQuery ui?
[08:08:21] <aaronmcadam> kborchers is if he's around
[08:08:41] <aaronmcadam> also ajpiano karega
[08:09:00] <kborchers> yo
[08:09:24] <aaronmcadam> issue with draggables on mobile kborchers, I've surmised it must be cuz of the way click events work on mobile?
[08:09:34] <aaronmcadam> because of the delay in firing?
[08:09:40] <Hornet> aaronmcadam yes it's jquery
[08:09:43] <Hornet> look at the page
[08:09:44] <aaronmcadam> or god knows what
[08:09:52] <aaronmcadam> i have done Hornet
[08:09:56] <cakehero> Does anyone know if I need a plugin for the .link() function: http://api.jquery.com/link/ I am on 1.6.2
[08:10:04] <cakehero> it says it was added in 1.4.3 but it's under "plugins"
[08:10:45] <kborchers> UI does not work well on mobile ... we have plans to fix that with a rewrite of jquery.ui.mouse.js ... i believe. not sure when though. just planning right now
[08:10:51] <Gates> this is confusing me
[08:10:51] <karega|aniasis> kborchers, cscott's jquery ui fork is how compatible with 1.8.15
[08:11:00] <Gates> any idea why .attr('checked') only works for a lil
[08:11:04] <kborchers> many things work fine but dragging is an issue
[08:11:07] <Gates> and then always decides teh box is checked?
[08:11:15] <Gates> AKA- How do I check teh status of a checkbox?
[08:11:16] <karega|aniasis> kborchers did you see my question?
[08:11:32] <ngharo> Gates: .is(':checked')
[08:11:38] <karega|aniasis> I want to use cscott's jquery.ui.mouse.js with 1.8.15
[08:11:41] <karega|aniasis> can I do it?
[08:11:47] <aaronmcadam> kborchers, could do with backporting from jqm maybe
[08:11:58] <Gates> ngharo: its okay u can say it ... durr
[08:12:00] <Gates> lol thanks!
[08:12:01] <Hornet> any advances on my dual-firing event issue?
[08:12:18] <aaronmcadam> i don't think u should be doing it like that Hornet
[08:12:21] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: there is also talk of a merge with jqm ... again, just talk right now but i think that would make sense
[08:12:25] <Gates> if ($(this).is(':checked')) { var chbox = 'checked'; }
[08:12:31] <Gates> ngharo: yes?
[08:12:35] <aaronmcadam> yeah i know that was the original plan kborchers
[08:12:46] <karega|aniasis> can anyone see what I am talking about?
[08:12:49] <Hornet> aaronmcadam, well I guessed something was up
[08:13:01] <aaronmcadam> Hornet: why are you stopping prop and immediate too
[08:13:02] <ngharo> Gates: var chkbox = $(this).is(':checked'); is cleaner
[08:13:07] <Hornet> but it's either that or a higher event handler and target inspection
[08:13:12] <Hornet> to stop it bubbling, why do you think
[08:13:25] <aaronmcadam> why both?
[08:13:29] <Hornet> if it were bubbling that could explain the dual firing
[08:13:31] <karega|aniasis> kborchers...  I want to use cscott's jquery.ui.mouse.js with 1.8.15
[08:13:31] <Gates> ngharo: but i also need it to be 'unchecked' if its well unchecked
[08:13:47] <Hornet> because I don't want the event going anywhere else
[08:13:48] <aaronmcadam> can u not put a class on that parent
[08:13:52] <kborchers> karega|aniasis: i have not seen his fork and have no idea if that would work see ?tias
[08:13:52] <bot-t> karega|aniasis, Try It And See
[08:13:57] <Hornet> it doesn't need one?
[08:14:06] <ngharo> Gates: true would be checked, false unchecked
[08:14:16] <Gates> ngharo: i had problems
[08:14:47] <aaronmcadam> Hornet: you need to abstract your problem into a jsfiddle, have a few rows of ur data with only the code u *need*
[08:14:56] <Gates> ngharo: well im sending it over ajax as a _POST var thats why
[08:15:05] <aaronmcadam> that way u can see if it's something else or a problem with that piece of code
[08:15:11] <ngharo> Gates: var chkbox = $(this).is(':checked') ? 'checked' : 'unchecked';
[08:15:16] <Gates> yay
[08:15:23] <Gates> ngharo: that'd work yes
[08:15:24] <aaronmcadam> or just
[08:15:29] <Hornet> aaronmcadam there's only like 6 lines of JS
[08:15:36] <aaronmcadam> $(this)[0].checked will do Gates, ngharo
[08:15:42] <Hornet> if it were any more simplistic it wouldn't work at all
[08:15:54] <Gates> aaronmcadam: i dont get
[08:15:55] <aaronmcadam> it can help
[08:16:04] <Hornet> I know it can, but I don't think it will
[08:16:06] <aaronmcadam> when u abstract it away u can notice shit
[08:16:09] <Hornet> I'm not a noob here
[08:16:23] <aaronmcadam> also
[08:16:24] <Hornet> I just want some insight from other people, not basic recommendations
[08:16:28] <aaronmcadam> why is ur code not in ur head
[08:16:36] <ngharo> $(this)[0].checked can be just this.checked
[08:16:40] <Hornet> I'm developing it still
[08:16:48] <Hornet> and JS doesn't live in the head these days anyway
[08:16:50] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[08:16:53] <Hornet> much to my annoyance
[08:16:54] <nickasloan> are there any known issues with iOS 5 right now?
[08:17:08] <aaronmcadam> If it's extracted to a js file, yeah
[08:17:29] <aaronmcadam> Hornet: put it in the head for now and see if anything happenes
[08:17:33] <Hornet> it won't
[08:17:35] <aaronmcadam> s/es/s
[08:17:41] <nickasloan> I'm doing $('.class').live('click', handler); and it doesn't seem to be working on iOS 5 only
[08:17:45] <nickasloan> bind works just fine
[08:17:52] <ravic> Am a beginner for JQuery. was looking for somehelp to use on  my personal website. am i on right channel?
[08:17:52] <Hornet> it's on a domready function, only works when clicked
[08:17:56] <Hornet> this isn't voodoo
[08:18:05] <aaronmcadam> it's definately bubbling issues
[08:18:11] <Hornet> how, it's all halted?
[08:18:18] <Hornet> this is what I don't get
[08:18:23] <aaronmcadam> it's obviously something else
[08:18:29] <Hornet> so it's not bubbling? :P
[08:18:33] <aaronmcadam> is there another one
[08:18:36] <Hornet> no
[08:20:04] <aaronmcadam> why've u got cdata in ur script btw lol
[08:20:12] <Fernandos> hi
[08:20:16] <HardPhuck> what can be the problem if my click is not triggered even if i have $(something).click( ...
[08:20:17] <Hornet> google advert code obviously
[08:20:20] <aaronmcadam> that's weird
[08:20:21] <Hornet> that's not related
[08:20:41] <aaronmcadam> I know
[08:20:45] <Fernandos> I tried to center box3 in this example http://jsfiddle.net/zs4gQ/22/ vertically.. but it doesn't work. any ideas?
[08:20:51] <Hornet> HardPhuck: probably wrong 'something'
[08:21:02] <Hornet> or it's caught elsewhere and halted
[08:21:12] <Fernandos> I guess it's even harder to center it across browsers vertically
[08:21:27] <Hornet> vertical centering is a bitch, it's css rather than jquery though
[08:21:33] <Hornet> there's a lot of stuff about it if you google
[08:21:49] <HardPhuck> Hornet i can put body inside and I don't get anything
[08:21:55] <Fernandos> Hornet: ohhh sorry man.. I accidently thought this is #css :D
[08:22:13] <ravic> i would want to place a menu bar on my website. how can i achieve it using jQuery.
[08:22:31] <ravic> reference to any demo exmaples will be much appreciated.
[08:22:40] <ravic> thanks in advance
[08:22:54] <ntoll> Hi, how do I make sortables (specifically portlets: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#portlets) work in such a way that only the title bar is draggable and the text content is selectable..?

[08:25:49] <HardPhuck> Hornet: http://www.medis.si/izdelki/brez-recepta-novi/
[08:26:01] <HardPhuck> a click on the image should trigger the event
[08:26:39] <HardPhuck> http://www.medis.si/fileadmin/templates/novi.medis.si/js/irfaq_modal.js
[08:26:45] <HardPhuck> here's the javascript
[08:27:19] <ngharo> HardPhuck: $(body) should be $('body')
[08:27:23] <ngharo> the console is your friend
[08:27:30] <aaronmcadam> haha ngharo :D
[08:27:52] <Hornet> I know how to bind a click event, jesus
[08:28:00] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[08:28:00] <Hornet> sorry but I need insight here, not basics
[08:28:06] <Hornet> http://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat/mobile/showselect
[08:28:12] <aaronmcadam> if ur attitude adjusted just a tad
[08:28:16] <aaronmcadam> you might get some help
[08:28:22] <ngharo> Hornet: whats the problem
[08:28:40] <aaronmcadam> double firing events
[08:28:47] <Hornet> aaronmcadam, if you listened to what I was saying I'd not get annoyed
[08:28:58] <Hornet> and tbh it doesn't help that you type like a 12 y/o
[08:29:01] <aaronmcadam> I didn't paste u anything
[08:29:09] <Hornet> ngharo: http://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat/mobile/showselect
[08:29:23] <Hornet> click a row, the event (bound _once_) fires twice
[08:29:27] <HardPhuck> ngharo: still no effect
[08:29:32] <HardPhuck> not sure why :S
[08:29:38] <Hornet> I've even tied it to a single element this time rather than iterating
[08:30:04] <aaronmcadam> just use ajax it's fun :D
[08:31:53] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[08:32:19] <aaronmcadam> Yo Dawg, I Herd You Like Callbacks. So I put a function in your callback so you can function while you callback. :D
[08:33:24] <kborchers> Hornet: i believe your issue is there are two events
[08:33:28] <kborchers> 1) clicking in the div
[08:33:47] <kborchers> 2) clicking the label who's event bubbles to the div, thus firing the handler again
[08:34:01] <Hornet> I tried it with halting previously, that didn't stop it
[08:34:02] <kborchers> ?delegate @ Hornet
[08:34:03] <bot-t> Hornet, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:34:09] <Hornet> I'll try on the new example
[08:35:26] <kborchers> Hornet: try $('div.showselectbody').delegate( "label", "click", function(...
[08:35:32] <Berzerrkerrr> Can someone explain me what is the match for $( "li", $gallery ) selector? $gallery is <ul/> element
[08:40:29] <trose> hey so I'm piping data in the form of an xml string to my client page then doing $('body').append(data). when I console.log my data it is fine (example: <source> [sentence]</source>) but when i inspect the page source it looked like <source></source>[sentence]
[08:40:35] <aaronmcadam> yeah that'd be much better
[08:40:50] <trose> does jquery hate xml or something?
[08:41:47] <mikunos1> hi guys is possible get as response of a jquery post a file?
[08:42:08] <aaronmcadam> trose have u tried $('source').text( data ) ?
[08:42:16] <aaronmcadam> sorry "sentence"
[08:42:44] <mikunos1> I mean if is possible call a $.post and get as result a pdf string file
[08:42:53] <HardPhuck> anyone care to help me out, why would the click event not work?
[08:43:06] <trose> aaronmcadam, not yet. I just wanted to past the xml directly to the web page so i can apply css to it
[08:43:27] <mikunos1> any suggestion?
[08:43:28] <aaronmcadam> applying css directly to an xml node?
[08:43:48] <aaronmcadam> hmm mikunos1 have u tried setting dataType to text
[08:43:48] <pootpoot> mikunos1: are you talking about getting raw PDF DATA or a url link to a pdf ?
[08:43:57] <aaronmcadam> all u want is the string yeah
[08:44:04] <mikunos1>  pootpoot: pdf data
[08:44:47] <pootpoot> can js parse pdf data?

[08:45:24] <ngharo> HardPhuck: can you upgrade jquery on that page?  it's awfully out of date
[08:45:25] <pootpoot> ah nice
[08:45:41] <pootpoot> how do you get data from a file anyhow?
[08:45:45] <HardPhuck> ngharo: hm i'll try and hope nothing breaks :)
[08:45:55] <HardPhuck> it's a production site my client has
[08:46:27] <Cork[home]> pootpoot: normally its hosted on the server
[08:46:27] <Hornet> kborchers: look at the page now
[08:46:29] <JSM87> Hi guys, im using jquery cycle which is great. However, instead of it cycling 1 at a time, how can i get it to cycle in sets of 3 for example
[08:46:43] <Hornet> tried it a few ways, it's now using delegate, but still has the bug
[08:46:48] <Cork[home]> but you can grab it through the file api introduced in html5
[08:47:05] <pootpoot> ah, havent seen that
[08:47:21] <pootpoot> so if you host a pdf or some sort of image, you can grab its data with the file api?
[08:47:23] <ch3mical> It's like, new and stuff
[08:47:39] <ch3mical> File API is for local files
[08:48:09] <trose> aaronmcadam, oop I figured it out. I forgot <source> is an actual html5 tag now. I renamed my xml to source_sentence and it works fine
[08:48:13] <kborchers> Hornet: don't delegate to body ... you might as well use live which sucks. did you try $('div.showselectbody').delegate( "label", "click", function(...
[08:48:33] <Hornet> yes, but I'll change to to that again, one moment
[08:48:34] <kborchers> or div.checkrow or what ever you're calling it
[08:48:50] <Hornet> cf5
[08:49:25] <Cork[home]> pootpoot: no you can grab the file if its from the server
[08:49:38] <Cork[home]> or ask for a file through the <input type=file>
[08:49:46] <Cork[home]> if its a local file
[08:49:47] <Hornet> what I can't fathom is how currenttarget is ALWAYS the same thing, yet it runs twice, surely if it were bubbling etc it'd be two targets
[08:50:08] <Hornet> kborchers^
[08:50:25] <Cork[home]> pootpoot: if you want the actual data it can still be done, but then you need to hand it to a canvas i think
[08:50:38] <kborchers> check event.target Hornet
[08:50:41] <ngharo> Hornet: look at event.target.  the li fires, then the checkbox
[08:50:44] <JSM87> I'm using jquery cycle which is great. However, instead of it cycling 1 at a time, how can i get it to cycle in sets of 3 for example # Can anyone help please?
[08:50:46] <Cork[home]> pootpoot: that data is a bit old though so there might be new things in the file api
[08:51:03] <kborchers> Hornet: and you get the same thing with $('div.showselectbody').delegate('label'... ?
[08:51:03] <pootpoot> Cork[home] so when you do var file = html5_get_file( file ) ..... ydo you know how to read its bytes? to check for headers and stuff
[08:51:10] <ngharo> err label then check or somethin
[08:51:14] <HardPhuck> ngharo: jquery updated, no difference
[08:51:47] <Hornet> kborchers, yes
[08:52:37] <kborchers> Hornet: no, exactly as i wrote it 'label' not 'div.checkrow label'
[08:53:00] <Hornet> does it matter unless there's a comma involved?
[08:53:01] <Hornet> one sec
[08:53:14] <Hornet> exactly the same
[08:55:01] <ngharo> HardPhuck: http://jsfiddle.net/xW5Vp/ try this
[08:55:14] <kborchers> oohhhh, the label is triggering a click on the checkbox maybe? try $('div.showselectbody').delegate('input:checkbox', 'click', function(...
[08:55:18] <kborchers> Hornet: ^^
[08:55:47] <Hornet> aha
[08:55:48] <Cork[home]> pootpoot: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_files_from_web_applications
[08:55:50] <Cork[home]> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/FileReader
[08:55:53] <Hornet> you may be onto something yes
[08:55:56] <Hornet> one sec
[08:56:03] <pootpoot> sweet thx
[08:56:42] <Hornet> kborchers, cf5
[08:56:54] <Hornet> I think you're right about the cause, but even that fires twice still
[08:57:14] <kborchers> not that looks right ... you have to console.log()'s
[08:57:23] <kborchers> *two
[08:57:34] <HardPhuck> ngharo: works
[08:57:42] <HardPhuck> so i had to run noconflict :S
[08:57:42] <Hornet> ah whoops, forgot I had current there as well
[08:57:49] <Hornet> my bad, thanks for the spot :)
[08:57:54] <kborchers> np
[08:58:15] <kborchers> ok, back to work for me :)
[08:58:23] <ngharo> HardPhuck: kewl.  pretty much you were missing a "on dom ready" wrapper.  that's what $(function() {  }) is
[08:59:05] <ngharo> HardPhuck: so your binds were firing before the document loaded when the elements didnt exist
[08:59:34] <HardPhuck> thanx a lot! saved my day :)
[09:01:38] <mikunos1> hi guys if I send a simple url like /tmp/myfile.pdf jquery creates a backslashes url
[09:01:48] <mikunos1> how have I to solve this problem, please?
[09:04:00] <mikunos1> any idea?
[09:04:31] <ngharo> /tmp/myfile.pdf gets rewritten to \tmp\myfile.pdf?
[09:04:48] <ngharo> DOES NOT COMPUTE
[09:04:57] <mikunos1> solved!
[09:04:58] <mikunos1> thanks

[09:05:27] <Fayde> Hello, I want to fadeIn a div when someone submit a form
[09:06:02] <ngharo> k do it
[09:06:09] <Fayde> This code doesn't work.. $('form').submit(function(){ 	 	$('#fadeIn').hide().fadeIn(1500); 	 });
[09:06:30] <jedimind_> Fayde, ...
[09:06:36] <jedimind_> it works
[09:06:50] <jedimind_> but your form is probably submitting
[09:06:54] <jedimind_> so you cant see it
[09:07:10] <jojovem> Anyone knows how can i prevent the weird behavior when resizing the window using carousel?
[09:07:18] <jojovem> Here is the link
[09:07:19] <jojovem> http://www.ricardoeletro.com.br/Produto/Informatica/Notebook/Positivo/Notebook-Intel-Core-i3-Tela-14-2GB-HD-320GB-DVD-RW-HDMI-Bluetooth-SIM-7360-Positivo/49-82-96932
[09:07:31] <jedimind_> that is one long url
[09:07:44] <jojovem> Resize the window horizontally and youll notice that the accesorries bar ust below the product
[09:07:55] <jojovem> have a weird behavior
[09:08:00] <ch3mical> jedimind: only took up 2/3 of my screen
[09:08:01] <ch3mical> :P
[09:08:10] <jedimind_> it only took up 2/3 monitors
[09:08:13] <Fayde> jedimind_: Ye, ofc it does?
[09:08:19] <Fayde> That's what I want it to do?
[09:08:21] <Fayde>  :D
[09:08:30] <jedimind_> Fayde, so if the form submits, the page refreshes...
[09:08:32] <jojovem> im trying to fix it but im not having success
[09:08:38] <jedimind_> so youre obviously not going to see the animation
[09:08:42] <Fayde> jedimind_: Pretty much yea
[09:08:46] <jedimind_> since youre not longer on that page
[09:09:34] <ravenzz> jojovem which behavior?
[09:10:18] <jojovem> It seems that the carousel drops, and get up back again
[09:10:20] <jojovem> several times
[09:10:31] <ravenzz> oh while you are resinzing the window?
[09:10:35] <jojovem> yes
[09:10:44] <jojovem> only on chrome
[09:10:55] <ravenzz> mh but I suppose that it should be a CSS issue
[09:10:56] <ngharo> Fayde: you can ajaxify it something like: $('form').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $('#fadeIn').hide().fadeIn(1500); $.post(this.action, $(this).serialize()) });
[09:11:16] <Rixius> I have an image that I'm animating the opacity on hover, and for some reason the hoverOut is going instantly, while the hoverover is as it should be. http://jsbin.com/ikilor/edit#javascript,html
[09:11:20] <Fayde> ngharo: Alright, let's try it out
[09:11:53] <ravenzz> jojovem probably a width issue
[09:11:55] <jojovem> I tried to add clear classes, tried to change the height, tried to make different wrappers
[09:11:59] <jojovem> non of them helped me
[09:12:47] <ravenzz> well try to set the width to half of the current one
[09:13:06] <ravenzz> and check if you still have the same issue
[09:13:19] <jeffsmykil> Is there a better solution to this problem than this?  http://exoboy.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/make-your-jquery-website-buttonslinks-work-with-ipadiphone/
[09:13:55] <jeffsmykil> the whole on click iOS thing
[09:15:04] <Fayde> ngharo: Didnt fadeIn
[09:15:56] <ngharo> link?
[09:16:41] <Fayde> ngharo: http://jsfiddle.net/d5BCy/
[09:16:44] <ch3mical> jeffsmykil: I've actually not had that problem with mobile browsers (iOS)
[09:16:57] <jeffsmykil> ch3mical: I'm having it on one set of buttons
[09:16:59] <jeffsmykil> none else
[09:17:05] <ch3mical> Strange
[09:17:19] <ch3mical> jeffsmykil: jquerymobile, or vanilla jq?
[09:17:29] <jeffsmykil> ch3mical: and I don't really want to loop through every element and add on clicks on load
[09:17:33] <jeffsmykil> vanilla
[09:17:45] <ch3mical> Yeah, that's a stupid solution anywas
[09:17:49] <ch3mical> anyway*
[09:18:39] <ch3mical> I don't really have a solution for you though, without better understanding the problem.
[09:19:02] <jeffsmykil> not the easiest problem to debug unfortunately
[09:19:11] <ch3mical> I can imagine
[09:19:29] <ch3mical> Are you using .bind or .click or what?
[09:19:50] <ngharo> Fayde: http://jsfiddle.net/d5BCy/2/ working here
[09:20:00] <jeffsmykil> im using a live click
[09:20:08] <jeffsmykil> but im using those on ones that work too
[09:20:18] <krz> how can i do something like: $('#side_panel_for_now_playing ul li:last(3)')
[09:20:24] <krz> which gets the last 3 li's ?
[09:20:44] <ch3mical> jeffsmykil: maybe try a different method? I dunno
[09:20:49] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[09:20:54] <jeffsmykil> i have some other shit to fix too
[09:21:32] <jeffsmykil> like a total rewrite :/
[09:21:46] <ngharo> krz: i dunno if you can do that with just a selector
[09:21:52] <slinkp> Can anybody confirm/deny whether $(foo).val('bar')  is supposed to trigger an event on the matching elements, like maybe a 'change' event?
[09:21:56] <ch3mical> jeffsmykil: fun!
[09:22:05] <ngharo> ?gt @ krz
[09:22:06] <bot-t> krz, :gt(index): Select all elements at an index greater than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[09:22:08] <ngharo> is that helpful?
[09:22:11] <krz> ngharo: how can i delete the last 5 <li> elements in a <ul> ?
[09:22:51] <Fayde> ngharo: Yeah, nice! Wont work on my site though.
[09:23:01] <Fayde> I guess I'll figure it out soon
[09:23:03] <slinkp> doh.  apparently not: http://api.jquery.com/val/#comment-117202237
[09:23:11] <slinkp> that is rather surprising.
[09:24:16] <krz> thanks ngharo
[09:24:32] <jojovem> Trying to set a width didnt help me
[09:24:33] <jojovem> :(
[09:26:57] <drjones69> krz: Could you splice the array?  $('LI').splice($('LI').size()-5),5).remove()(top of my head code, untested)
[09:27:01] <jeffsmykil> ch3mical: it's only like 1100 lines of coude
[09:27:02] <phlp> krz: $('ul li').slice(-5).remove();
[09:27:13] <drjones69> Even simpler ;-)
[09:27:30] <krz> phlp: that would remove the last 5
[09:27:35] <ch3mical> jeffsmykil: that could definitely eat up your afternoon
[09:27:52] <jeffsmykil> or the next month
[09:27:53] <phlp> krz: isnt that what you wanted?
[09:28:00] <jeffsmykil> lol
[09:28:00] <jeffsmykil> this is taking me forever
[09:28:02] <krz> $('#foobar ul li:gt(19)').remove() will only remove any li's after 20
[09:28:06] <krz> which seems to work
[09:28:12] <jeffsmykil> ch3mical: so much ajax and json and xml
[09:28:50] <ch3mical> heh
[09:32:40] <drjones69> Since it's a bit livier now, I'll try one I asked earlier - it's no longer needed (did a hack around) - but interested to know for future reference.
[09:32:46] <drjones69> Afternoon all -(hopefully) quick query - how can one select a select of elements, but exclude elements which contain a child matching a given criteria?  - ie (in psuedo-query) - select all elements of class '.xyz' except for those elements of class '.xyz' that have a child matching '.selected'
[09:32:47] <Rixius> Does anyone have a moment to glance at the animation issue I'm having?
[09:32:48] <Rixius> I have an image that I'm animating the opacity on hover, and for some reason the hoverOut is going instantly, while the hoverover is as it should be. http://jsbin.com/ikilor/edit#javascript,html
[09:33:55] <phlp> drjones69: $('.xyz:not(:has(.selected))');
[09:33:56] <Fayde> Haha ngharo, I can't find out why it wont work for me
[09:34:00] <Fayde> ngharo: https://pastee.org/emef
[09:34:33] <drjones69> phlp:  Muchos thanks ;-)  I was darn close - missed out on the ':has()' ;-)

[09:48:40] <azorai> PPPaul, it should. Is it not?
[09:48:44] <PPPaul> no
[09:49:00] <azorai> Assuming `html` is something like "<div><select>...</select></div>"...
[09:49:02] <PPPaul> wait, going to try .first()
[09:49:23] <PPPaul> doesn't work
[09:49:36] <PPPaul> $(html).find('select:first')  that look ok?
[09:50:32] <PPPaul> ok, i got it
[09:50:34] <PPPaul> wooooo
[09:50:43] <PPPaul> must be blind today
[09:51:23] <pen> hey
[09:51:37] <stribor> anyone knows why on submit event returning false submit button is grayed out
[09:51:40] <pen> any good library to share variables between javascript files?
[09:51:45] <pen> or jquery functions?
[09:52:18] <PPPaul> can i use Jquery to find labels?
[09:52:44] <azorai> pen: Just use global namespaces ... Or global vars (but be careful)
[09:52:59] <azorai> PPPaul: u mean <label> elements? Yup.
[09:53:03] <pen> you mean window.thing?
[09:53:23] <PPPaul> is it easy, or should i add attrs to the things i want to query instead?
[09:57:26] <jedimind_> can anyone suggest a method to make mousewheel scroll horizontally instead of vertically ?

[10:07:43] <stribor> why is return false on submitr event graying out submit button
[10:10:34] <zanberdo> I have a function which is being passed as a parameter some XML (see http://pastebin.com/ZZEAV6kW). I need to drill into the XML to retrieve the <parameter> blocks which themselves contain <valueName> and <value> blocks. I'm using $.each(parameters, function(index, parameter) { dosomething}); to iterate through the <parameter></parameter> elements but I can't seem to get into the new 'parameter' to extract the <valueName> and <
[10:10:35] <zanberdo> value> elements. How would I drill into parameter with jquery to extract the <valueName> and <value> elements?
[10:17:37] <PPPaul> in jquery can i query for and element where the element is part of node in my parents parent?
[10:20:32] <adrianp> PPPaul: you mean it's a child of a child node in your parent?
[10:22:32] <chrisinajar> PPPaul: you mean a sibling?
[10:22:34] <PPPaul> siblings is what i want, i think
[10:22:49] <chrisinajar> two nodes that share a mutual parent?
[10:22:54] <adrianp> you can cycle through your parent's .children() or select next(), prev()
[10:22:57] <PPPaul> but, maybe it's my parents sibilings because stuff is nested with labels
[10:23:15] <chrisinajar> <div><p>this</p><p>and this</p></div>
[10:23:33] <PPPaul> more nesting than that
[10:23:58] <falieson> can someone take a look at this? http://ibworks.gepresenteerd.nl/index.php?page=payrolling my slideUp/slideDown isn't working...  i think its just something simple
[10:24:06] <chrisinajar> you might need to select the parent then do some iterating on children using each() and children()
[10:24:07] <PPPaul> .parentsUntil().find() is what i want i think
[10:25:31] <PPPaul>  $(this).parentsUntil('select').find(".startTime .endTime")
[10:25:36] <PPPaul> it's not working, though
[10:25:58] <Articate> how can I check if a string contains something besides the alphabet and ","?
[10:26:08] <PPPaul> regex
[10:27:10] <PPPaul> rexegpal.com
[10:27:10] <jeffsmykil> ch3mical: why do i show things to my boss?!
[10:27:15] * jeffsmykil facepalm
[10:27:21] <PPPaul> lol
[10:27:54] <ch3mical> lolz
[10:28:04] <Doggie52> What CSS class does superfish apply to the parent of a child one is hovering over? Let's say I have a menu with an item that spawns a dropdown-menu beneath it when hovered over. I want this item to have the same color when hovered over itself as when I move the mouse down to the dropdown-menu's items.
[10:28:19] <Doggie52> Pardon me if this is the wrong channel or medium to ask such a question in!
[10:28:51] <zanberdo> let me try again (hopefully I can be more clear in my needs): I have a function which I'm passing as a parameter an xml structure that looks like http://pastebin.com/7YM9kGvh. I need to iterate through all <parameter> elements and extract the <valuename> and <value> elements. How can I do this with jquery? I'm able to iterate through the <parameters> with $(parameters).each(function(){}); but I'm stuck. I'm unable to drill into
[10:28:51] <zanberdo>  the subsequent <parameter> element and extract the <valuename> or <value> elements.
[10:30:13] <jeffsmykil> ch3mical: and it involves talking with the scary russian SQL guy
[10:30:20] <PPPaul> .find(".startTime .endTime")   what should this return?
[10:30:26] <PPPaul> what is it searching for?
[10:30:38] <PPPaul> i assumed all classes that matched startTime and endTime
[10:31:59] <jbelcher> PPPaul that's searching for an element with a class named "endTime" that's a decedent of an element with a class named "startTime"
[10:32:29] <dogarrhea2> hrm what actually determines which target has been dropped on..
[10:32:31] <PPPaul> can i search for 2 classes at the same time?
[10:33:10] <jbelcher> PPPaul yeah just like the CSS syntax you add a comma between them:  .find('.startTime, .endTime')
[10:33:18] <PPPaul> thank you
[10:34:10] <LSpoor> hey guys, need a bit of help. first off if you visit this; http://sites.lukespoor.com/portfolio/ and click any of the links other than Services. you'll see how jquery fits in. now. my problem. on the homepage it has those About & Service links in the body. the about link is not going to the about page correctly unlike the link in the nav bar. if you guys could be of any help id much appreciate it
[10:34:18] <ch3mical> jeffsmykil: lol
[10:34:42] <PPPaul> is there something special i can do with labels in Jquery?
[10:35:02] <jbelcher> I need to implement message queuing for AJAX calls. Is Ben Alman's plugin still la good choice with recent version changes to $.ajax? http://benalman.com/news/2010/01/jquery-message-queuing-plugin-v10/
[10:35:13] <PPPaul> i'm hiding things that are in labels, but i want to hide the labels as well
[10:37:10] <LSpoor> anybody?
[10:37:39] <sadmicrowave> hey guys, I'm needing help appending a ui-dialog-button to a .dialog() element.  I want to do this live rather than in the .dialog() init.  I'm trying to locate the method to call in order to gain access to the ui-dialog-options so I can then append the button context to that...any ideas?
[10:38:23] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/PVmbB/1/ my show/hide isn't working =(
[10:38:29] <jbelcher> LSPoor: in the case of a.jquerylinks, $(this).find('a') won't hit since $(this) is already the a
[10:38:42] <jbelcher> so it's not finding that href
[10:38:55] <LSpoor> jbelcher: im not really that good at jquery, how would i fix this then?
[10:39:59] <stribor> what are reasons that submit buttons grays out and cant be clicked is submit event returns false
[10:40:22] <eddiemonge> falieson: maybe because you need to load jquery in the top left and its .click( function () {}
[10:40:24] <jbelcher> LSpoor: change the selector for .click() to work on the anchor tags in both cases and then you'll not need to .find('a')
[10:41:00] <eddiemonge> falieson: and if you want to toggle them : http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/PVmbB/3/
[10:41:32] <LSpoor> Jbelcher: i dont mean to be an idiot but could you please define that a bit more. i don't understand, sorry
[10:41:40] <falieson> eddiemonge: thanks
[10:42:08] <falieson> eddiemonge: i had this working before... just moved all of my js out of my index and I lost this segment
[10:42:10] <falieson> much appreciated
[10:43:32] <PPPaul> i have a .toggle() on my checkbox... logic is working, but my checkbox is not being checked
[10:43:37] <glauco29> hi
[10:43:39] <jbelcher> LSpoor—part of the problem is that you've written code that needs to handle two special cases: clicking a tab <li> element, or clicking a link on the page.
[10:43:48] <eddiemonge> ?prop @ PPPaul
[10:43:49] <bot-t> PPPaul, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[10:43:55] <glauco29> I need add query string in url, what is best way?
[10:44:10] <PPPaul> sooooooo
[10:44:16] <PPPaul> .prop("checked")
[10:44:30] <PPPaul> this is how i set the property?
[10:44:34] <jbelcher> LSpoor: really you're only trying to do one thing: intercept intrapage links and activate an appropriate tag, so I'd write your code more generically to make that happen.
[10:44:45] <eddiemonge> PPPaul: yes
[10:44:49] <b1lly> lets say i JSON.parse and object
[10:44:56] <b1lly> and i wanted to return the object.field
[10:45:00] <b1lly> how do i do that
[10:45:05] <LSpoor> jbelcher: im unable to write the code myself as i dont know jquery, im only doing a simple copy+paste job really :/
[10:45:06] <eddiemonge> glauco29: for what purpose?
[10:45:26] <eddiemonge> b1lly: like that
[10:45:44] <jbelcher> LSpoor: in that case I'd look into some plugins that handle this type of tab activation pattern.
[10:45:50] <PPPaul> prop isn't working
[10:45:55] <LSpoor> jbelcher: is there any you recommend?
[10:46:19] <PPPaul> why is my checkbox acting weird when i add a .toggle() to it?
[10:47:10] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ PPPaul
[10:47:10] <bot-t> PPPaul, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[10:47:11] <glauco29> I have a form to get result from a report, when user to fill all fields and submit, I will perform an ajax request, but I need store typed data in url cause if him to send url to someone, the person will can generate the same report
[10:47:25] <jbelcher> LSpoor: I don't do a lot of plugins personally but I'm sure if you poke around you'll find plenty. Just look for tabs (jqUI has plenty here too)
[10:47:42] <jbelcher> Trying this again: I need to implement message queuing for AJAX calls. Is Ben Alman's plugin still la good choice with recent version changes to $.ajax? http://benalman.com/news/2010/01/jquery-message-queuing-plugin-v10/
[10:48:22] <LSpoor> jbelcher: okay thankyou
[10:48:36] <iamjarvo> glauco29 shouldn't you be looking at a database driven solution?
[10:49:26] <PPPaul> when i do a breakpoint my checkbox gets checked, after it gets checked somehow it gets unchecked
[10:49:27] <PPPaul> git://gist.github.com/1301787.git
[10:49:39] <glauco29> I just need know a better way to add a query string
[10:49:40] <eddiemonge> glauco29: so you want to fill the form fields with values from the url?
[10:49:51] <glauco29> no eddie
[10:50:07] <eddiemonge> im confused then
[10:50:09] <glauco29> If user copy and paste the url
[10:50:37] <glauco29> He will get the same data like if him typed
[10:51:02] <iamjarvo> glauco29 i would just save the data and then generate a url and give it to the user
[10:51:42] <iamjarvo> then when someone goes to the url sends a request and it will populate
[10:51:55] <eddiemonge> what iamjarvo said ^^^
[10:52:01] <glauco29> I can not save url
[10:52:14] <iamjarvo> glauco29 save the data from the form
[10:52:20] <glauco29> No
[10:52:26] <glauco29> The form is just to querys
[10:53:13] <eddiemonge> glauco29: no, submit the query form like you would normally. then have the backend generate a url to generate a report with the same params
[10:53:21] <glauco29> I need to perform a search via Ajax, and store data this search at url,
[10:53:26] <iamjarvo> eddiemonge i think its search form
[10:53:37] <iamjarvo> so instead of doing post  do a get
[10:53:43] <iamjarvo> and the browser handles all that
[10:54:02] <iamjarvo> glauco29 what is your form backed by php?
[10:54:05] <glauco29> I will use AJAX
[10:54:08] <iamjarvo> ooo
[10:54:11] <glauco29> I am using CakePHP
[10:54:26] <glauco29> I will not refresh the page
[10:55:10] <iamjarvo> maybe you will have to piece the query together yourself from the form fields and then place it somewhere that the user can copy it
[10:55:57] <eddiemonge> i love when people make things super difficult
[10:56:37] <iamjarvo> eddiemonge gots to have the web 2.0 effects!

[11:20:05] <eddiemonge> that shouldnt disable your submit button. you should be using  see ? preventdefault

[11:45:57] <devc> glauco29: Does it need to check that when ti's selected?

[13:04:58] <kavelot> i have many <div> containers with the same ID... when I call $(this).parent().remove() from some element inside it, it removes all divs with same ID... is it possible to make it remove just its parent?
[13:05:16] <eddiemonge> stribor: it doesnt for me. you know you are assigning the keypress to a button right? which means the button has to have focus in order for it to work
[13:05:22] <eddiemonge> kavelot: no
[13:05:24] <eddiemonge> just no
[13:05:30] <eddiemonge> "same ID"
[13:05:52] <eddiemonge> id's are unique in a page
[13:06:13] <kavelot> eddiemonge: that's because it's adding new fields to a form dinamically
[13:06:23] <kavelot> so i though I could just leave the id
[13:07:09] <eddiemonge> kavelot: you can increment the ids but the ids must be unique
[13:07:10] <Creap> I'm doing $.when(foo(), bar()).done(function(a, b) { .. }); and foo and bar's Deferred objects both return a value, but I only get foo's value to the a variable in done()
[13:07:32] <Bustin> Hey there. I am using jquery and ajax to post to a validate file (php). I'm new to jquery / ajax - but am not getting any alert from the success.. here is my code http://pastie.org/2731632  ... also, when I click the button it only toggles if the button is clicked, how to make it toggle if button is clicked and close if you click outside the box? Thanks for your help
[13:08:21] <razzi> i want to this: $(".date").datepicker({ buttonText: $(this).attr('title') });  but since the code runs in global scope "this " points to document object, is there a way i can somehow refer to the selected element from inside the initializing object?
[13:09:20] <razzi> bustin, why not try .post shortcut?
[13:09:22] <eddiemonge> Bustin: what does console say about the response from the server? or if the request is even getting sent
[13:09:22] <tomasm-> hi, is there an easy way for an ajax call in an iframe to update a container in the parent frame?
[13:10:18] <Bustin> razzi: using .post, can I exclude dataType and type?
[13:11:15] <kavelot> eddiemonge: it worked with .clone().attr('id' ...) :)
[13:11:16] <kavelot> thanks
[13:11:35] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: easy? not really
[13:12:02] <eddiemonge> Bustin: did you get my questions?
[13:12:36] <Bustin> eddiemonge: Hi, yes sorry. Firebug console? I'm not getting anything
[13:13:19] <razzi> bustin, it has same functionality just a more convenient form
[13:13:24] <razzi> did anybody see my question?
[13:13:30] <eddiemonge> Bustin: no ajax call?
[13:13:55] <Bustin> eddiemonge: ah got it. I guess I should define var email and var password for the datatype
[13:14:27] <Bustin> Is there a way to encrypt the password using ajax / jquery when I look @ the parameters it's plain text
[13:15:10] <kavelot> is it possible to do that using show() in one line? $('#adicionar').before($('#templateForm').clone().attr({'id': 'materia' + fieldID, 'style':'display:'}));
[13:18:33] <eddiemonge> Bustin: not really. its sent over post though so its no different than submitting the form like normal
[13:19:36] <razzi> i want to this: $(".date").datepicker({ buttonText: $(this).attr('title') });  but since the code runs in global scope "this " points to document object, is there a way i can somehow refer to the selected element from inside the initializing object?
[13:19:47] <Bustin> eddiemonge: so sending the data through json then encrypting on the php side of things to check against the encrypted value stored in the database is fine?
[13:20:32] <snover> Bustin: first of all, I hope you mean “hash”, not “encrypt”
[13:20:57] <Bustin> snover: yes sorry. The hash
[13:21:42] <snover> second of all, if you are using an insecure channel, it does not matter if it is hashed on the client or the server. If it is hashed on the client, then eavesdroppers can simply use the hash, unless you use a nonce, in which case it would need to be stored plaintext on the server, which is a far riskier proposition.
[13:24:14] <razzi> Sigh, why don't I ever get an answer when I go ask a question once a year :(

[13:29:24] <intellilogic> PrgmrBill: can I build a selector based on the JSON attributes?  I've been able to work with the data( $('input[data-aj]).data("aj").Action ), but not build a good selector.  I want to only select if the action is "AddTblRow"
[13:30:00] <jcrawford> so has anyone seen that happen and have any thoughts to why it would happen
[13:30:12] <PrgmrBill> intellilogic: you can't just do .action but I'd imagine you can parse the value and get it that way
[13:31:24] <razzi> eddiemonge, anyway, thanks for the suggestion, I hadn't thought of it
[13:34:27] <acidjazz> hey i got a sweet jquery querstion
[13:35:01] <acidjazz> i have a modal function set i use to control these modals and upon the modal starting up,, i do the $('html').click handler w/ the event.stopPropagatino(); thing for hte modal itself
[13:35:17] <intellilogic> PrgmrBill:  How?  and build a selector.click?
[13:35:25] <acidjazz> so when you click away it goes away.. problem is when i spawn those handlers upon a click.. the $('html').click immediately fires
[13:35:39] <PrgmrBill> intellilogic: no, once you have the value (which is JSON), parse the JSON and retrieve the action property
[13:42:27] <`teh1> hey
[13:43:17] <`teh1> is there a way to detect whether a click event is a propagation?
[13:43:43] <eddiemonge> `teh1: look at the target
[13:44:37] <`teh1> thx eddiemonge
[13:47:05] <devc> Bueller, Bueller... Anyone has issues with .animate() -- I'm trying to slide something from x,y to x2, y2 and it won't animate until I also have height: 'toggle' in the animation
[13:48:31] <js_node> hi, is there anyway where we can detect the content of the div has changed?
[13:48:39] <js_node> onChange
[13:51:12] <Phrogz> js_node: The DOM 2 Mutation events are what you want, but they're a) not supported by IE and b) going to be removed in the future.
[13:54:32] <ColKurtz> I'm confused. I'm using $.ajax to post a form submission. I have an error() callback function so that if there's an error, it does a normal $(form).submit(); instead of an AJAX submit. But when that error function gets called, it looks as though the form gets submitted twice. http://pastie.org/2731869
[13:59:32] <karega|aniasis> when using jquery ui's switchClass, how are the styles applied?
[13:59:36] <karega|aniasis> In what order?
[13:59:42] <karega|aniasis> ajpiano, do you know this?
[14:02:45] <ajpiano> not off hand
[14:05:41] <bittyx-windows> hiya, i've made a fiddle to ask my question about - http://jsfiddle.net/gKSJn/ <--- when doing .switchClass(), is there any way to also animate all the elements whose properties are dependent on their parent class? in my fiddle, clicking on the third (bottom) div will nicely transition the background color (since the class directly defines the background color), but clicking on the first two only changes the background color when the animation
[14:05:41] <bittyx-windows>  is actually finished
[14:10:07] <PlasmaHH> hi, I got some question for jqGrid, I am trying to use local array data together with a pager, but it doesnt seem to work... the pager is displaed, but it seems to ignore rowNum setting and always displays everything... any way to get it to use the pager, or does that only work with nonlocal data?
[14:11:46] <nickasloan> is there a best way to mark an element as shown or hidden by default?
[14:11:51] <nickasloan> display: none;?
[14:12:14] <nickasloan> (I'm referring to .show() and .hide()
[14:12:35] <devc> you want something in css to be hidden and then with jquery later to show()?
[14:13:57] <bakers> I just have a .hidden class that apply with html/css and then use jquery show() later
[14:14:53] <devc> yep, then display:none; is what you want
[14:15:02] <devc> .show() will transition to display:block;

[14:16:33] <sherl0ck> anyone know of a plugin that makes a menu like this one on the right - http://www.spokeo.com/search?q=john%20smith ?
[14:18:13] <pootpoot> i dont think that really requires a plugin? its just some nice css?
[14:18:50] <pootpoot> ah, the back button scrolls backward
[14:20:15] <mekwall> usually does
[14:26:21] <dogarrhea2> hello.  Is there some way of defining which item a draggable item will be dropped on?
[14:26:41] <dogarrhea2> looking at the demo, there's some "halfway" or more rule.. it doesn't look at wether or not your mouse is over the drop target
[14:26:48] <Whirl3dOrd3r> spokeo doesn't have 1/10 information correct. LOL
[14:27:36] <Whirl3dOrd3r> but it sure looks pretty
[14:27:52] <dogarrhea2> is this behavior defined somewhere (besides source) ?
[14:29:17] <mekwall> Whirl3dOrd3r: yes, but not for the draggable, but for the droppable
[14:29:30] <mekwall> Whirl3dOrd3r: there's an option called accept for the droppable
[14:29:39] <mekwall> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#option-accept
[14:30:20] <dogarrhea2> i wonder if there's a way to specify a specific corner must be over the drop target
[14:30:25] <dogarrhea2> in tolerance
[14:31:10] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: not without hacking the droppable
[14:31:35] <dogarrhea2> bleh @ hacking
[14:31:51] <mekwall> ok. let me rephrase... extend
[14:32:12] <mekwall> jquery ui is not an out of the box solution for everyone :)
[14:33:26] <dogarrhea2> ok i had an idea but it's really ugly
[14:33:37] <dogarrhea2> change the droppable event listener to "touch"
[14:33:52] <dogarrhea2> each one measures it's upper left corner in relation to the upper left corner of the draggable UI object
[14:34:08] <dogarrhea2> and only the one that has a certain distance triggers it's drop function
[14:34:37] <dogarrhea2> well that's a hack too but
[14:37:38] <dogarrhea2> is there a GetElementAtPosition(x,y) kind of selector?
[14:39:33] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.droppable.js
[14:39:43] <mekwall> its not really that hard to change/extend
[14:40:18] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: look at _over, _out and _drop
[14:44:24] <dogarrhea2> so is that code doing what i am describing or?
[14:46:04] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: you have to override/extend them with your functionality
[14:46:23] <dogarrhea2> hrm. i don't know what any of these variables are doing..
[14:46:25] <Spektrum> hi
[14:46:38] <Spektrum> I've got a very weird problem
[14:46:58] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: well, what you're asking is pretty much a premium feature and not really a problem.
[14:47:00] <dogarrhea2> what's an "accept" and a "ddmanager"
[14:47:26] <dogarrhea2> i know now. i will think about this some more
[14:47:34] <dogarrhea2> but diving into the code bliindly won't help me now
[14:47:44] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: accept is what elements that the droppalbe accepts
[14:48:03] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: well, its the same here really ;)
[14:48:20] <Spektrum> suppose I have an element and I'm applying a class rule, which defines a position for an element
[14:48:31] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: had the same questions about the overlay for dialogs not being animataed
[14:48:35] <mekwall> animated*
[14:48:51] <Spektrum> then I print a position rule from that element
[14:49:03] <devc> Anyone had issues with .animate() -- I'm trying to slide something from x,y to x2, y2 and it won't animate until I also have height: 'toggle' in the animation. I'd like to not have to use a height property at all.
[14:49:10] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: and nobody could answer that, so I made this: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/zKRYG/
[14:49:14] <Spektrum> 2 of 10 times position is not applied immediately
[14:49:46] <dogarrhea2> how long did that take
[14:49:48] <mekwall> Spektrum: test case?
[14:50:19] <Spektrum> are you asking whether this is a part of the test?
[14:50:20] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: initial version took me about a day, but I've extended it way beyond that ;)
[14:50:51] <akolesnikov> ОЯЕБУ!
[14:51:03] <mekwall> Spektrum: there's no way to solve a problem without seeing it
[14:51:18] <mekwall> so saying you got a problem I can't see... means I cant help you
[14:51:53] <ShaunR> i want to display a dialog but with no title, basically i want a box to display with a modal and there to be no buttons or a title.  whats the best way to do this? (jqueryui)
[14:52:33] <Spektrum> http://pastebin.com/bAJzq4vg
[14:52:38] <Spektrum> here it is
[14:52:57] <sadmicrowave> is there a way to get the height of an element before its added to the dom? so basically: $('<p>' + myContentVar + '</p>').height();
[14:53:11] <Spektrum> sometimes it's outputting "absolue", like expected
[14:53:23] <Spektrum> but in rare cases it prints static
[14:53:52] <dogarrhea2> mekwall: lines 128 - 132 contain the logic for detecting a drop?
[14:54:04] <devc> sadmicrowave: I'm 90% sure that before it hits the dom it doesn't have a height unless it's specifically set
[14:54:19] <sadmicrowave> devc, thats what I'm thinking too
[14:54:26] <devc> sad think about the different in height that <p> would be if its parent was 150px wide vs. 900px.
[14:55:12] <sadmicrowave> ShaunR, you can set an event function for the 'open' option in the dialog init where you pass 'e' and traverse through it to get ui-dialog-titlebar and remove the element that way
[14:56:19] <Spektrum> mekwall, is this a known issue?
[14:56:32] <sadmicrowave> ShaunR, $('#dialaog').dialog({open: function(e){ $( e ).find('ui-element-titlebar').remove(); } });
[14:56:36] <sadmicrowave> something like that
[14:56:37] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: yeah, more or less
[14:56:52] <mekwall> dogarrhea2: but I guess _over is what you are after
[14:57:36] <dogarrhea2> so i suppose the code would be something like if(this.element.offsettop - ui.offsettop < CertainThreshold) keep going?
[14:57:40] <mekwall> Spektrum: what browser and version of jquery?
[14:57:56] <Spektrum> chrome latest and latest jquery
[14:57:56] <dogarrhea2> that would basically trigger for all the things yea. i'll look at _over
[14:58:32] <mekwall> Spektrum: what does .position() give you?
[14:58:49] <jeejejej> http://jsfiddle.net/B4gDe/2/
[14:59:00] <Spektrum> gimme a minute
[14:59:07] <jeejejej> blur is not working
[15:00:57] <jeejejej> blur event is not working, blur is not working
[15:01:04] <jeejejej> http://jsfiddle.net/B4gDe/2/
[15:01:46] <dogarrhea2> mekwall: http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui-dev/browse_thread/thread/a9546baafa78135a hahaha your name shows up when i look for what a hoverclass is
[15:03:21] <ngharo> jeejejej: $('#content').blur(function() { .. })
[15:03:48] <ngharo> you're missing parenths.  also, doesnt look like blur fires for that type of element
[15:04:12] <dogarrhea2> this.over is not the same as the _over: function ()  i am guessing
[15:05:31] <Spektrum> mekwall, it gives me zeros when container is properly set to absolute position even though css "left" is 20px :O
[15:05:32] <jeejejej> ngharo: thanks
[15:05:33] <Spektrum> wtf
[15:06:23] <dogarrhea2> don't think the over function is going to help me much either. doesn't look like there's any logic that decides whether something is over
[15:06:36] <devc> Anyone have any idea why .animate() needs height set to 'toggle' to work for me? I've been struggling for 4 hours and have not made an ounce of headway.
[15:07:51] <Spektrum> devc, upload your code to pastebin
[15:07:52] <dogarrhea2> anyone know what these _someFunction underscore things are for?
[15:08:05] <devc> Spektrum: http://jsbin.com/otunuc/edit#javascript,html
[15:08:15] <dogarrhea2> for example in the droppable over function, it uses a _over function as a callback..
[15:08:33] <devc> you're missing the image file so it's not the easiest debugging, but the code's all there
[15:08:52] <devc> Lines 171-175 of script.js have the animate function.
[15:09:10] <devc> The second to last line is where I call that method.
[15:11:10] <dogarrhea2> mekwall:  I dont need over out or drop method extended functionality
[15:11:31] <dogarrhea2> i just need to go to line 160 through 181 to actually get to the logic
[15:13:08] <dogarrhea2> any jquery committers know how this whole commit process works?
[15:13:17] <Spektrum> devc, what are the style attributes on the element being animated?
[15:13:36] <Spektrum> you can view them in firebug
[15:13:48] <devc> Spektrum: I'm sliding the element across the screen.
[15:14:03] <devc> demo: http://clients.jpgninja.com/kidzsmart.com/potandon_book01/
[15:14:28] <devc> the green leaf is the thing being slid.
[15:14:31] <devc> obviously. haha
[15:14:59] <Spektrum> adn you also need to animate it's height?
[15:15:46] <devc> Well, I jsut figured it out but I'll answer your Q anyways ;)
[15:15:59] <devc> I don't want height to animate. I want it out of there completelt
[15:16:19] <devc> BUT if I changed it to anything but toggle, it wouldn't animate, it would just appear at the end of the animate call.
[15:16:57] <devc> But when I .addObject() in my code I had a .hide() which was of course not what I wanted. Didn't see it until now.
[15:23:17] <oijuih> hello people, what is the selector for an event on each td of a table except the last row?
[15:23:25] <oijuih> I tried $('tr').children().not(':last').click(function(){
[15:23:45] <oijuih> but that means just the very very last td, as if all tds were children of the tr. weird huh?
[15:24:19] <oijuih> so imaging a 3x3 table, I want the right 3 td's making the right column to not be selected
[15:24:50] <oijuih> $('tr').children().not(':last').css({'background': 'red'}); makes the whole thing red except square 9, I want 6 and 3 to stay uncolored too (this just a test case)
[15:25:54] <MISI> 'td tr' instead of 'tr'?
[15:27:05] <oijuih> got it
[15:27:15] <oijuih> $('table td:not(:last-child)') instead of $('tr').children().not(':last')
[15:27:17] <oijuih> pfft
[15:30:28] <zanberdo> if I have a hidden field on my form with value=foo|bar|bay and I want to iterate through the pipe-delimited list, is it reasonable to expect the following to work: $('myfield').val().split("|").each(function() { dosomething }); where dosomething would reference $(this) which I'm expecting to return the values foo, bar, bay in turn?
[15:31:14] <ColKurtz> I have a form that submits using ajax, and I'm trying to have it do a normal submission as a fallback in case the ajax error() callback is executed
[15:31:33] <ColKurtz> but it seems like when error() gets executed, the form is submitted twice

[15:33:46] <imanc> is there a way to get text to fit to a path - e.g. wavy or crcular etc. with jquery?
[15:33:52] <imanc> * circular
[15:33:58] <imanc> upside down, etc.
[15:45:49] <coldhead> how are all god's chillun today
[15:53:48] <catcher> Is it possible to get the ID of the currently hovered element?
[15:54:28] <coldhead> $(this).attr('id')
[15:54:44] <ekkis> is there a way to trap exceptions in jquery for missing methods?
[15:54:48] <coldhead> but i'm suspicious of your needing it, catcher
[15:54:53] <coldhead> ekkis: HAHAHAHAHAHHA
[15:54:57] <coldhead> that's a hot topic lately
[15:55:03] <ekkis> really?
[15:55:04] <coldhead> at the moment: no :(
[15:55:04] <ekkis> heh
[15:55:37] <catcher> coldhead, It's seeming that the reason I'm running into so much trouble (same problem with dynamic hrefs) is that my app is using ajax with hashbang URLs.
[15:56:08] <ekkis> I want to store a copy of a jquery object in a DOM object such that when a method is invoked against a jquery object, if the method called fails, it looks up the stored object and makes the call
[15:56:16] <catcher> coldhead, I've been learning as much as possible, and the solution here is still escaping me-
[15:56:37] <catcher> coldhead, the class I need to add a click handler to has no idea which element is selected, and it needs to.
[15:56:52] <catcher> coldhead, Even tried another plug and ran into the same issue :-/
[15:57:52] <coldhead> catcher: can't you pass the element around directly?
[15:57:58] <coldhead> the `this`
[15:58:07] <coldhead> rather than requery for it?
[15:58:35] <catcher> coldhead, Unfortunately, 'this' is always coming up with the first element in the dynamically generated list, rather than current.
[15:58:46] <coldhead> catcher: that's horrendous
[15:58:50] <coldhead> it shouldn't be so
[15:58:59] <coldhead> do you have a live demo?
[15:59:07] <coldhead> someone smarter than me can probably fix it in a jiffy
[15:59:39] <ProLoser|Work> NEED MORE DJs: http://turntable.fm/freenode
[15:59:51] <catcher> coldhead, it's in local dev only unfortunately. Code coming up. Thanks again for trying!
[16:00:38] <catcher> coldhead, btw, I'm finding I need to inline my jquery code in in my view (Cakephp) in order to even get the tooltips to fire.
[16:02:19] <coldhead> gross, php
[16:02:25] <coldhead> well you'll get there, catcher
[16:02:31] <coldhead> and you'll be a better person for it
[16:02:37] <catcher> haha, agreed, thanks :)
[16:02:48] <catcher> I've learned a ton about jQuery in the process already, the hard way..
[16:03:01] <imsky> open up your heeaaaaart
[16:03:55] <catcher> coldhead, one more point to make - my click handler is on the .tooltip class itself, which isn't actually used in my html.
[16:04:14] <catcher> coldhead, hence $('this') not referring to anything useful
[16:06:45] <eddiemonge> anyone ever use http://cloud9ide.com ?
[16:07:27] <coldhead> catcher: i hope you mean $(this) and not $('this')
[16:07:40] <imsky> <this>is wrong</this>
[16:07:50] <catcher> coldhead, I do, sorry
[16:07:56] <coldhead> and i hope you're using .live('click', ... to bind to the element even if it doesn't exist yet
[16:08:01] <coldhead> which is what live is for
[16:08:08] <imsky> or delegate which is way better
[16:08:22] <js_noob> hi, http://jsfiddle.net/MFWZ8/17/
[16:08:28] <coldhead> thank you imsky for volunteering to give a 3 hour tutorial on delegate
[16:08:28] <eddiemonge> ...unless you dont have a parent selector, then live is better
[16:08:39] <js_noob> onblur event on the div is not working
[16:08:44] <imsky> coldhead: when i had to learn it, i got it in like 5 minutes...
[16:08:45] <coldhead> ANYWAY as i was saying i hope you're using live(), simple and effective
[16:09:08] <coldhead> and you can enjoy imsky's naked video tutorial on delegate later
[16:09:14] <imsky> i do it with butter
[16:09:27] <coldhead> AND IN THAT LIVE HANDLER this really should refer to the element you are hovering over
[16:09:42] <coldhead> it jut should
[16:09:46] <coldhead> just*
[16:09:56] <coldhead> that's how it rolls
[16:10:01] <imsky> butter rolls?
[16:10:05] <js_noob> http://jsfiddle.net/MFWZ8/17/ - onblur event is not working
[16:10:08] <eddiemonge> js_noob:  i dont think you can have an editable in an editable
[16:11:22] <catcher> coldhead, here's the basic idea: http://jsfiddle.net/L5ruW/
[16:11:42] <coldhead> yeah i'm not going to look at that for a little while at least :)
[16:11:52] <coldhead> massive cunting day at the office to get through first
[16:12:00] <coldhead> imsky seems full of bright ideas though!
[16:12:06] <imsky> i love you so hard coldhead
[16:12:18] <coldhead> and not condescending or belittling or sarcastic or anything
[16:12:19] <coldhead> :D
[16:12:23] <catcher> haha
[16:12:32] <coldhead> i commend him to you, catcher
[16:12:39] <catcher> ty coldhead
[16:12:40] <coldhead> good work, team
[16:13:29] <js_noob> ok,  eddiemonge thanks, http://jsfiddle.net/MFWZ8/20/
[16:14:38] <catcher> it seems there's a basic concept I'm missing more than anything.. I hover over the href/image, which fires a tooltip based on the call to tooltip() function for all elements with that class.  I need the tooltip overlay itself to link to the image behind it, which I can't seem to select.
[16:14:49] <catcher> imsky, what do you think? :)
[16:14:58] <imsky> catcher: about wut
[16:15:06] <js_noob> how many of you think captcha for freenode is working correctly, many times i have typed wrong then i have entered
[16:15:30] <catcher> imsky, the line just above where I asked you what you think
[16:15:37] <thinkclay> hey guys, I'm having jquery UI issues.. I need to pass a dialog width dynamically but I dont think the way I'm doing it is the proper method. Any help is greatly appreciated http://jsfiddle.net/MnmSs/
[16:15:59] <eddiemonge> catcher: i think you dont understand how the plugin is working or dont know what it is doing and maybe need to actually look at the source code for it
[16:16:02] <imsky> catcher: your question makes...no sense
[16:16:50] <eddiemonge> thinkclay: sounds like a bad ui with different sized dialogs all over the place
[16:16:53] <catcher> eddiemonge, I tried another plug and ran into the same issue.. it's just elduing me how to add a specific link to an element that applies to many elements, since they all have the same class.
[16:17:43] <thinkclay> eddiemonge, it's not. I'm using standards for most places, but there are 2 exceptions where I need smaller boxes
[16:17:51] <eddiemonge> catcher: well somewhere in the plugin you should be getting passed a reference to the element that has the tooltip attached to it. you should be able to use that reference for your own devious schemes
[16:18:31] <catcher> eddiemonge, that makes sense.. bummer that the js is minified :-/
[16:18:46] <eddiemonge> thinkclay:  i think once its defined, you have to set the option and then call the open method
[16:18:53] <thinkclay> catcher: there are tons of tools to unminify online
[16:19:49] <thinkclay> eddiemonge: ahh so a single key/value instead of an object?
[16:20:02] <eddiemonge> catcher: if its an open source project the unminified code should be somewhere
[16:20:12] <eddiemonge> thinkclay: um sure although im not positive
[16:21:36] <acidjazz> how do i get hte width of a browser window minus the scrollbar width?
[16:22:53] <eddiemonge> width should be it
[16:24:18] <Hopsy> does firebug have debuglevels?
[16:24:53] <LakWork> ben_alman are you around?
[16:33:07] <johnywp> hello all
[16:51:47] <b1lly1> is there a way to pass an object into a function and then do object.method() within that function?
[16:52:24] <eddiemonge> b1lly1: assuming the function takes an argument, yes
[17:03:53] <Axsuul> Is there a way to call a css :hover event on an element?
[17:05:18] <coldhead> you have to fake it by adding an extra rule in your CSS to match some class and then add/remove that class to the element, Axsuul
[17:05:38] <Axsuul> bummers, ok thanks
[17:11:58] <erichynds> ajpiano: ping
[17:12:18] <Hopsy> coldhead: when do we going to write some new poems :( ?
[17:13:33] <coldhead> i think all the major poetry competitions have just announced their shortlists
[17:13:39] <coldhead> so we'll have to try for next year, Hopsy
[17:15:31] <catcher> Is it possible to create a new div with custom click behavior from within an event handler?
[17:16:32] <catcher> inside my $('.class')live(mouseover, function(){ ,  I want to create a new div that knows about my current context of $(this).
[17:23:50] <Ephexeve_laptop> Hey all, need a help, I have this piece of code for the login, everytime the user click outside the login, the window fades out, but the thing is, even if I click on the login, and click at the password or email text box, it fades out too!
[17:27:13] <Ephexeve_laptop> Anyone?
[17:27:49] <eddiemonge> what are you targeting for the click?
[17:29:16] <iande> Ephexeve_laptop: something like this: https://gist.github.com/1302791 ?
[17:29:44] <iande> I may have missed some punctuation there
[17:31:13] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: let me try, just a sec
[17:31:35] <iande> also, alert is a terrible choice for that
[17:31:47] <iande> but it gets the idea across
[17:31:59] <iande> if I understood your question correctly, that is
[17:32:36] <abjorn> Brodingo: roflmao @ your twitter post
[17:32:43] <abjorn> fuck floats
[17:37:29] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: this is the code I have now http://codepad.org/WHt8oHSw
[17:38:12] <Ephexeve_laptop> but now when I put the mouse in the login, it fades away! Any idea for that? (sorry, not a pro in jquery myself)
[17:40:28] <iande> I'd bet that there are no other 'mouseover' handlers, so any mouseover event bubbles up to your handler on $('body')
[17:41:50] <sneakyness> where can I read more about bind vs live vs delegate at?
[17:42:35] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: any idea?
[17:42:42] <iande> one sec
[17:42:46] <Ephexeve_laptop> ok
[17:43:08] <coldhead> sneakyness: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/09/28/jquery-1-7-beta-1-released/
[17:43:18] <coldhead> check out the first chunk about on/off
[17:43:21] <sneakyness> oh no
[17:43:23] <coldhead> that's the new black
[17:43:29] <sneakyness> I just rewrote like 1,100 lines of JS
[17:43:31] <sneakyness> not again…
[17:43:31] <sneakyness> no
[17:43:37] <coldhead> hahahha
[17:43:49] <sneakyness> coldhead: do you live in bay area?
[17:44:22] <coldhead> no
[17:44:35] <coldhead> think much much much furhter away
[17:44:38] <coldhead> further than russia
[17:44:45] <iande> Ephexeve_laptop: https://gist.github.com/1302791 the revised bit
[17:45:26] <sneakyness> damn I wanted to buy you a beer, I owe you and I finally got a fake
[17:45:33] <iande> if you're creating the '.new_session' dom object on the fly, you may have to do things differently
[17:45:47] <thinkclay> what is the syntax to create an element as a jquery object like $foo = '<button></button>'; and then bind events to that object?
[17:46:27] <erichynds> thinkclay: $("<button>").bind("click", fn)
[17:46:36] <thinkclay> thanks!
[17:46:44] <erichynds> or $("<button>", { click: fn })
[17:47:28] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: let me try
[17:48:47] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: works, but when clicking at the login window (email text box for example) it fades away too!
[17:50:25] <iande> hmm
[17:51:35] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: :(
[17:52:52] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: What is happening here?
[17:53:02] <iande> doing some testing now
[17:53:03] <Ephexeve_laptop> is there anything to do with our code ?
[17:53:07] <Ephexeve_laptop> Ok
[17:54:55] <coldhead> sneakyness: i'll look you up next time i'm in the bay area! thx!
[17:55:11] <sneakyness> coldhead: I've owed you beers since I was at least 16. I'm 20 now. Weird…
[17:55:11] <iande> mouseout gets triggered where I didn't expect it
[17:55:18] <sneakyness> I have a fake though and I turn 21 on the 8th :D
[17:55:27] <coldhead> what a long strange trip it's been
[17:55:32] <sneakyness> iande: put a border on the element to get a better idea
[17:55:45] <sneakyness> coldhead: and here I am building some lady gaga social network in san francisco, huge upgrade from my mom's basement :D
[17:56:26] <coldhead> that's living the dream! i'm on the opposite path
[17:56:34] <coldhead> building an antisocial network
[17:56:36] <coldhead> outside sf
[17:56:42] <coldhead> moving back into the parental basement
[17:56:44] <coldhead> :(
[17:57:00] <iande> sneakyness: I am, thanks :)
[17:57:21] <iande> trying this out in jsfiddle heh
[17:57:55] <sneakyness> coldhead: I miss my parents basement
[17:59:20] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: ?
[18:01:01] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: still there?
[18:01:43] <iande> yeah, I'm testing it out in jsfiddle to see why exactly mouseout is firing
[18:01:52] <Ephexeve_laptop> ok
[18:12:22] <iande> Ephexeve_laptop: May have given you the wrong event to use, sorry
[18:12:52] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: no worries, you found out the problem?
[18:13:04] <iande> I think so, one second
[18:13:19] <iande> use `mouseleave` instead of `mouseout`
[18:13:55] <iande> http://jsfiddle.net/h5SyJ/ as an example
[18:19:05] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: Ok, I want to change a little
[18:19:22] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: I want to click at another thing then the login dissapears, any idea?
[18:19:33] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: Sorry for bothering, and thanks for the help
[18:20:32] <iande> Ephexeve_laptop: then you just need a click handler on your other thing to do the fadeOut instead of doing it in a mouseleave
[18:22:09] <Ephexeve_laptop> iande: thanks!
[18:22:17] <iande> n/p
[18:22:38] <catcher> coldhead, I got it!!
[18:23:08] <catcher> ended up writing it from scratch. Event handler within an event handler with dynamically generated IDs did the trick.
[18:23:49] <Jordank> hey guys, could somebody look at a pastebin and tell me why I'm not able to use the result of this jQuery call in any variables? http://pastebin.com/ZT2tguqN
[18:32:14] <b1lly1> is there a "append" if dont exist, replace if do exist
[18:32:18] <b1lly1> as apposed to doing .append ?
[18:32:39] <coldhead> good work catc
[18:33:06] <coldhead> bot-t: tell catcher good work, babe
[18:33:06] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[18:33:11] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[18:33:11] * bot-t sighs
[18:34:24] <iande> hahaha
[18:34:56] <iande> I'm an idiot
[18:36:01] <iande> catcher: I originally wrote this for you: https://gist.github.com/1302791 but ended up directing it at Ephexeve_laptop
[18:36:14] <iande> ah, and catcher's gone, so I fail again
[18:53:34] <js_noob> hi, http://jsfiddle.net/Sz8QG/1/  the numbers are not appearing
[18:57:25] <cypha> what's an alternative to jquery-templates? since it's being discontinued
[19:21:59] <coldhead> JmZ_: could you please use a less offensive quit message?
[19:22:17] <Myra> What's his quit message?
[19:23:52] <sneakyness> If you have a selector cached like var bacon = $("#bacon, #coldhead");, when you're using it, is it better to use $(this) or the cached selector?
[19:24:00] <sneakyness> in the callback
[19:24:10] <sneakyness> and why
[19:27:09] <lng> hi! how do I access JSON object fethced over AJAX? remind me pls - I forgotten it

[19:33:59] <abjorn> im not an advocate
[19:34:37] <cypha> why?
[19:34:59] <kenneth> hey quick question, i got a page which plays audio via flash, is there a way to, using jquery / js see what audio files it's using?
[19:35:21] <kenneth> or kind of capture network requests done by the page?
[19:36:20] <mick_laptop> when gnash can't connect it tells me the rtsp stream
[19:36:50] <mick_laptop> look for rtsp or rtmp w/ tcpdump
[19:39:01] <nathanw_> hey all
[19:39:09] <nathanw_> need to convert one of my web apps to use offline storage
[19:39:15] <nathanw_> thinking of using this http://amplifyjs.com/api/store/ . thoughts ?
[19:39:19] <nathanw_> what's the best way to go about it ?
[19:43:07] <lng> what is the function name to match descendants of element?
[19:43:21] <lng> children?
[19:44:39] <lng> yes, resolved, sorry
[19:44:56] <cypha> abjorn, why don't you like jquery-tmpl?
[19:49:50] <mick_laptop> kenneth: no idea about doing anything remotely close w/ jQuery (also... what made you think jQuery was  the right tool?)
[19:51:02] <mick_laptop> nathanw_: that looks interesting
[19:51:13] <nathanw_> :)
[19:51:20] <mick_laptop> local storage has always been a pain (x-browser crap)
[19:52:13] <nathanw_> all good - ipad only
[19:52:13] <nathanw_> ;)
[19:53:02] <mick_laptop> if anyone knows why this errors, that would be nice to know: $("a[href$=.pdf]").after("<img src='pdf.gif' align='absolute' />");
[19:54:25] <lng> how to access data: variable in success: function of ajax?
[20:28:42] <Taggnostr> I have something like <tr><th>foo</th></tr> <tr><td class="bar">baz</td></tr>, starting from the th, how can I get to the td? I tried next and nextAll on both the th and its parent, but it didn't find it.  I want to match only the first td.content that appears after that th
[20:37:38] <Taggnostr> foo.parent().next().find('td.bar') works, but it's not too elegant...
[20:46:14] <adz> I see template is depreciated. what is the correct way to template with jquery?
[20:46:36] <coldhead> the correct way is the one that works for you :_
[20:46:41] <coldhead> :)*
[20:46:47] <coldhead> people quite like mustache.js!
[20:47:20] <coldhead> http://mustache.github.com/
[21:02:58] <bronitta> hey there. i'm developing a jquery plugin using the widget factory. i'm looking for a good way to implement some methods that keep track of things that apply to the entire plugin, not individual elements. is there anything more i can do besides adding $.myPlugin to the namespace? so i can call $.myPlugin('doSomething') without a selector
[21:42:19] <SinnerNyx> am i missing something? http://jsfiddle.net/gRb9W/
[21:42:31] <js_node> hi, can anyone please tell me http://jsfiddle.net/VWDH9/3/ why this is not working
[21:42:53] <context> nice
[21:43:37] <context> "it dont work" does not describe your problem. does not in anyway explain what you are looking for. gives us no urge to want to remotely read through lines of code and guess what your problem is and maybe give you an answer that even relates to what you are looking for
[21:44:40] <js_node> when i click on Hi, the content of the div should alert
[21:45:28] <Cork> js_node: cause your defining a function in an onload event and then tries to call it from the body
[21:46:27] <js_node> no, i am not calling onload
[21:46:47] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/VWDH9/3/ check the dropdown on the right side
[21:46:49] <SinnerNyx> js_node: all the javascript code in jsfiddle is called onload
[21:46:52] <Cork> sorry left side XD
[21:46:53] <context> js_node: http://jsfiddle.net/VWDH9/12/
[21:47:11] <context> if you're going to use jquery... use it
[21:47:48] <SinnerNyx> so, ya my issue is that I'm trying to use the .load handler jquery provides as I thought this would work across browsers but it's not working in my chrome when a regular onload does.
[21:47:54] <SinnerNyx> http://jsfiddle.net/gRb9W/
[21:48:27] <tsunadi> can someone take a look at my code, it keep freezing my site http://pastebin.com/1XPtfcZV
[21:49:19] <context> that looks like a mess
[21:49:33] <tsunadi> thanks =/
[21:49:48] <js_node> context: thanx for it, what i have is a div's in loop, i want i am assigning them id's div_1, div_2.... i only pass the id to the function, there i would make div_id = "div" + id;  then call $("#div_id").html();
[21:50:18] <context> sinnernyx: uhh
[21:50:34] <context> sinnernyx: whats not working?
[21:50:41] <SinnerNyx> context, is it working for you?
[21:50:47] <SinnerNyx> the second messagebox doesn't pop up for me
[21:51:04] <context> sinnernyx: well... pretty sure browser wont fetch an image if its not in the dom
[21:51:26] <context> http://jsfiddle.net/gRb9W/1/
[21:51:28] <context> that works here.
[21:51:51] <SinnerNyx> context, why does the first image onload get called.
[21:52:01] <SinnerNyx> and also, how does image preloading work then?
[21:52:03] <context> i dont get the first one in yours
[21:52:08] <js_node> context: http://jsfiddle.net/VWDH9/14/
[21:52:13] <context> oh wait yeah i did
[21:52:39] <context> js_node: STOP USING ONLOAD
[21:52:56] <context> http://jsfiddle.net/VWDH9/15/
[21:53:01] <ryanneufeld> o/
[21:53:10] <context> js_node: upper left... "no wrap (head)"
[21:53:22] <context> js_node: someone already said this 5 minutes ago
[21:53:35] <context> sinnernyx: not sure :x
[21:54:04] <tsunadi> anyone have any suggestions?
[21:54:08] <SinnerNyx> context: thanks for trying anyways :)
[21:54:26] <js_node> i am getting null, i should get div contents, like H11,H12
[21:54:45] <context> sinnernyx: i use jquery event handlers everywhere else, never had to for load() :/
[21:55:12] <context> js_node: no you shouldnt
[21:55:23] <context> js_node: there is no #id in your html
[21:55:25] <SinnerNyx> context: fair enough.. weird that ti doesn't work. maybe its just a bug in jquery
[21:56:55] <context> sinnernyx: well noticed one issue with your pastie
[21:57:07] <SinnerNyx> plz share :)
[21:57:35] <context> jimg ... jimg.load() ... img.src
[21:58:19] <context> oh. i know i think
[21:58:45] <nathanw> how do I execute a function on press of a radio button?????
[21:58:45] <context> sinnernyx: you need $(jimg).load()
[21:58:51] <context> Image isnt a jquery object.
[21:58:55] <js_node> thanks, context , its now working...bye
[21:59:14] <ryan0071> i want to generate all possible combinations of a list of words...

[21:59:22] <context> nathanw: click? change?
[22:00:07] <nathanw> click doesn't seem to work
[22:00:09] <nathanw> ill look up change
[22:00:18] <SinnerNyx> context: sigh.. i'm too tired. i hope thats not the issue in my main code or i'll flip
[22:00:50] <context> ryan0071: all you need is a string, its length, and loop through it, done loop first char, loep again for next
[22:01:00] <context> ryan0071: simpler using a recursive function
[22:01:07] <nathanw> context: http://jsfiddle.net/D7Nzu/
[22:01:17] <nathanw> trying to make one selected on radio button click
[22:01:25] <nathanw> getting no result atm
[22:01:59] <context> uhh there is no radio buttons for one
[22:04:40] <context> nathanw: am i suppose to click a radio button that doesn't exist ?
[22:05:27] <nathanw> i just posted the JS..
[22:05:45] <context> post something thats actually suppose to work
[22:05:58] <context> im not gonna write code to help you
[22:08:44] <context> nathanw: and try different events, you have what im guessing one of will work: change, click, or select
[22:12:25] <nathanw> ok
[22:20:29] <nathanw> context: can I target a radio button just with an ID
[22:26:23] <clarkfischer> nathanw you can get a reference to the radio element by $('#radiobuttonsid')
[22:26:32] <clarkfischer> dunno exactly what you're doing though
[22:27:29] <nathanw> clark: thanks. still no clue as to why nothing is working yet
[22:28:43] <nathanw> DERP
[22:28:55] <nathanw> helps if JS is loaded after the element in question is -____-
[22:29:00] <clarkfischer> heh.
[22:29:06] <clarkfischer> DOM initialization is important
[22:35:29] <TheCode> > /mango|apple/ and new RegExp('mango|apple') are supposed to be the same right?
[22:35:43] <TheCode> because /mango|apple/.test('my mango manuice') and re.test('my mango manuice') are returning different results.
[22:36:26] <clarkfischer> TheCode, AFAIK, yes
[22:37:39] <clarkfischer> TheCode, Chrome is returning the same results for me
[22:38:51] <clarkfischer> (/mango|apple/).test("my mango manuice") === (new RegExp("mango|apple")).test("my mango manuice")
[22:39:47] <clarkfischer> v8> (/mango|apple/).test("my mango manuice") === (new RegExp("mango|apple")).test("my mango manuice")
[22:40:57] <Cork> clarkfischer: thats #javascript its ?eval here
[22:41:07] <clarkfischer> Thanks, Cork.
[22:41:16] <clarkfischer> It's true, I assure you, according to v8, at least.
[22:46:19] <chewedon> Hi guys, I'm trying to do preloading on my page using this example here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/476679/preloading-images-with-jquery
[22:46:37] <chewedon> Do I put my jQuery inside the jQuery(document).ready( . . . ); ?
[22:46:43] <chewedon> or do I put it before it?
[22:47:14] <clarkfischer> chewedon, Doesn't make a difference
[22:47:23] <clarkfischer> You don't have to wait for the dom to be ready to start preloading
[22:47:34] <clarkfischer> if you need to attach the images to the DOM, then you need it to be ready
[22:47:37] <chewedon> ok...maybe I'm missing something but my page doesn't feel any different...
[22:47:55] <chewedon> I still see the images being downloaded.
[22:47:58] <clarkfischer> oh.
[22:47:59] <chewedon> as the page loads.
[22:48:08] <clarkfischer> that's a different case entirely
[22:48:11] <chewedon> eh?
[22:48:16] <chewedon> So...what's image preloading ?
[22:49:05] <clarkfischer> image preloading, in that case, is like, if you're going to have a lightbox, then you'd want to preload the images so you don't see them loading once you've clicked the corresponding button that shows them
[22:49:15] <clarkfischer> what you want is to hide the images until they are loaded
[22:49:34] <clarkfischer> maybe add a css rule that display: none;'s the images until they are loaded?
[22:50:10] <chewedon> and how do I know when all my images are loaded ?
[22:51:15] <Cork> chewedon: listen for the .load event on the images, and count down, or save it in .data
[22:51:31] <clarkfischer> $(function () {$('img').load(function () { $(this).css('display', 'block'); }});?
[22:52:11] <chewedon> but...some of my images are backgroudn images set by css codes, others are pulled in from ASP.NET C# code.
[22:52:35] <clarkfischer> preloading is a big gimmicky, are you sure that you need to do this?
[22:53:08] <Cork> chewedon: there isn't anyway to know if a bg image is loaded, img tags though is through the .load
[22:53:17] <chewedon> Well, having a 24 inch monitor background image as the background of the site for each different "sub pages" will be slow to load.
[22:53:36] <Cork> chewedon: ouch... thats bad design...
[22:53:52] <chewedon> It looks nice though.
[22:53:55] <Cork> you never want the bg to be one none repeating image >_<
[22:54:08] <chewedon> Yes, I'm not the designer :P
[22:54:24] <chewedon> That's why I stay away from graphic design,especially for websites.
[22:54:32] <clarkfischer> Cork, you could, I suppose, have a detached img element load, wait for the load event, then apply the css rule
[22:54:42] <clarkfischer> but it sounds like you're in deeper waters than that
[22:54:45] <clarkfischer> I mean chewedon*
[22:54:52] <chewedon> Yes.
[22:55:24] <chewedon> Thanks for the insight nonetheless.
[22:56:05] <Bustin> Hey there. New to jquery.. I'm working on a validation script, that will validate logins and signups. Now my questions is, am I going about this the right way? http://pastie.org/2733707  -  How do I add an error for the call back to the current code? Any help is appreciated thanks.
[23:00:09] <chewedon> Hey, I think it's working :) I cleared cache in Firefox, then opened the page again, everything seems to load instantly now :D
[23:14:11] <coldhead> great work chewedon
[23:18:58] <govorunkz> hi all
[23:19:08] <KevinSjoberg> Hi
[23:20:46] <Rafaelzinhu> hi
[23:26:17] <sara> I'd like to send a JSON object as a -www-form-urlencoded instead. what's the command to do that with jquery?
[23:26:41] <nVee> sup guys
[23:27:17] <sara> is there a urlencode() function that works on key-value pairs/
[23:31:35] <ngharo> ?deparam @ sara
[23:31:36] <bot-t> sara, deparam | jQuery Plugins - jQuery BBQ leverages the hashchange event to allow simple, yet powerful bookmarkable #hash history. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full .deparam() method, along with both hash state management,... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/deparam
[23:31:50] <sara> many thanks ngharo, that's just waht I needed
[23:34:51] <Deele> sara, JSON.parse(text, reviver) and JSON.stringify(value, replacer, space) does that job
[23:35:22] <sara> Deele: thanks, I think my 401 unauthorized errors are coming from somewhere else than the json complaint, though
[23:35:48] <Deele> I see...
[23:35:48] <sara> weirdly, even with username: and password: set I'm throwing 401s even when the identical curl request comes back fine
[23:36:31] <ngharo> http auth?
[23:53:59] <medion> Hi, how would I clear a page of all elements using jquery?
[23:54:32] <iYuri> .empty() ?
[23:55:16] <medion> okay, but will that remove all elements in the page?
[23:55:33] <medion> for example, say I append to the body with $('body').append('text); ?
[23:55:34] <iYuri> http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[23:55:45] <iYuri> text and elements
[23:55:47] <medion> 'text'
[23:55:52] <medion> yes
[23:56:24] <iYuri> just try :)
[23:57:09] <medion> does .empty() require any arguments?
[23:57:26] <medion> I will assume no
[23:57:42] <clarkfischer> No, medion
[23:58:22] <medion> just one more thing... can I append variables using $('body').append('text' + var + 'text'); ?
[23:58:50] <clarkfischer> Yes
[23:58:58] <medion> thank you!
