[00:00:02] <Cork> your kidding me right?...
[00:00:11] <Cork> seriously...
[00:00:23] <game0> I'm sorry Cork
[00:00:36] <game0> this is all my code
[00:00:38] <Uhkis> this is getting pretty hilarious :D
[00:00:43] <Cork> ok, screw explicitly
[00:01:05] <Cork> assuming you load it from an address different then localhost:8085
[00:01:12] <Cork> it means your making a cross domain request
[00:01:22] <Cork> and browsers block this unless the server explicitly allow the request
[00:01:31] <Cork> that is the message you get
[00:01:50] <Uhkis> i think i got it!
[00:02:02] * Cork pokes Uhkis 
[00:02:03] <Uhkis> game0: what's on your browsers urlbar when you load that html file you pasted?
[00:02:46] <game0> I see this message in the console
[00:02:48] <game0> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8085/alfresco/service/hello. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 500
[00:02:56] <game0> what does this means
[00:02:58] <game0> ?
[00:03:01] <Cork> game0: your focusing on the wrong url
[00:03:09] <game0> file:///C:/Users/Hisham/Desktop/form/form.html
[00:03:12] <Cork> there we go
[00:03:30] <Uhkis> Cork: i told you i got it! :D
[00:03:31] <Cork> game0: you're making an ajax call from file:// to http://localhost:8085
[00:03:40] <Cork> game0: that is cross domain and the browser will block this
[00:03:41] <game0> yes
[00:03:56] <game0> what is cross domain means?
[00:04:06] <Cork> file:// => http://
[00:04:08] <Cork> in this case
[00:04:29] <game0> Yes, I got you
[00:04:36] <game0> so how can I fix this
[00:04:37] <Cork> the servers needs to be updated to check for an OPTION request
[00:04:54] <Cork> and as response to this request response with an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
[00:05:03] <Cork> where the value is null
[00:05:37] <Cork> game0: or simply serv the form.html file from localhost:8085
[00:05:43] <STFUn00b> hi guys... maybe wrong channel, but i can't get anyone to answer elsewhere. Need some help with windows gadget development. half of js just doesn't work in that environment. for example, how do i decode a json string, cuz eval function just doesn't work.
[00:05:50] <Cork> and you won't have this problem at all
[00:06:15] <Cork> STFUn00b: way, WAY offtopic for this channel
[00:06:27] <game0> I paste the file inside the tomcat and try to run it from there right?
[00:06:32] <Uhkis> STFUn00b: using jquery in it? yeah, half the stuff just doesn't work.
[00:06:53] <STFUn00b> uhkis no... pure js. cuz jquery didn't work lol.
[00:06:58] <Cork> game0: not sure what you use for localhost:8085, but see if you can load form.html from there instead
[00:07:05] <STFUn00b> but i guess it's because i included the latest version
[00:07:13] <STFUn00b> should've gone with 1.3 or something like thta
[00:07:15] <game0> Will it work if tried two tomcat in my machine
[00:07:17] <game0> ?
[00:07:24] <Uhkis> STFUn00b: use 1.x to get the ye olde ie support
[00:07:35] <STFUn00b> Uhkis ok, i'll try that
[00:08:20] <Uhkis> Cork: not that offtopic imo, those gadgets are html+js
[00:08:42] <game0> Cork: Will it work if tried two tomcat in my machine?
[00:09:11] <STFUn00b> those gadgets are definition for "retarded"... i tell you.
[00:09:33] <STFUn00b> btw... where can i get older versions of jquery, like 1.3 or smth like it?
[00:11:04] <Uhkis> http://code.jquery.com/jquery/
[00:11:13] <tty> bonjour. i have made a navigation bar that i want to include in 2 or more websites. how can I make a script (1~5 lines for example) so that i can copy this on another domain and inject the navigation bar?
[00:11:24] <STFUn00b> Uhkis: thank you.
[00:24:55] <Siente> good morning guys, If I know only the basics of JS can I learn jQuery?
[00:28:21] <Uhkis> Siente: yes, http://learn.jquery.com
[00:36:03] <Siente> Uhkis, okay thanks
[00:40:04] <tty> bonjour. i have made a navigation bar that i want to include in 2 or more websites. how can I make a script (1~5 lines for example) so that i can copy this on another domain and inject the navigation bar? (instead of copying 20+ lines of the html of the navbar)
[00:40:22] <Siente> $( "#myDiv p:first" ).html( "New <strong>first</strong> paragraph!" ); why it isn't changing anything ?
[00:40:35] <Siente> I have <div id="MyDiv"><p>foo</p></div> in my html ?
[00:45:07] <Siente> it's working
[01:02:49] <Siente> when I am trying to create a new element with $( "<p>This is a new paragraph</p>" ); nothing happens
[01:02:55] <Siente> any ideas why?
[01:03:58] <Siente> aaa okay when I create an element how to use it afterwards?
[01:04:18] <Uhkis> .append for example
[01:07:09] <Siente> Uhkis, but If I create an element this way $( "<p>This is a new paragraph</p>" ); am I able to use it or I should define it ?
[01:19:04] <Uhkis> Siente: you need to put it in a variable to use it later
[01:21:30] <Siente> yes so there's no sense of just creating an element this way $( "<p>This is a new paragraph</p>" ); ?
[01:22:11] <Siente> or I could do this $( "<p>This is a new paragraph</p>" ).appendTo("#content"); ?
[01:22:31] <dziegler> Siente: you may be searching for $(body).append('<p><foobar/p>') ?
[01:27:36] <Omar-> good morning
[01:30:04] <Siente> good morning
[01:38:37] <Xatenev> anybody familiar with jsPDF ?
[01:38:53] <Cork> jspdf? or pdf.js?
[01:39:25] <Cork> (never heard of jspdf)
[01:39:53] <Cork> ah, a generator
[01:40:10] <Xatenev> https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF
[01:40:13] <Xatenev> this one
[01:40:27] <Cork> ya, like i said, never heard of it
[01:40:32] <Xatenev> I dont get it to output the content on my pdf :(^^
[01:42:40] <Xatenev> wtf x)
[01:50:56] <mozzarella> guys help
[01:51:53] <_jules_> Hi everyone, I want to select all span that has class that starts with 'badge-pair-' but this selector doesnt work:  $('span[class^="badge-pair-"]') any ideas?
[01:52:09] <Cork> _jules_: don't use partial classes
[01:52:17] <Cork> split the class name into multiple classes
[01:52:23] <Cork> classes are meant for that
[01:52:38] <mozzarella> I'm using alert($("#player_div script")[1].text());
[01:52:42] <mozzarella> but it doesn't work
[01:52:47] <mozzarella> I get no alert
[01:52:51] <mozzarella> why is this?
[01:53:00] <Cork> mozzarella: text is a jquery function
[01:53:03] <Cork> not a dom function
[01:53:08] <Cork> use .eq(1) instead
[01:53:16] <Cork> (instead of [1])
[01:53:32] <mozzarella> doesn't [] return a jquery object?
[01:53:44] <Cork> no it returns the raw dom object
[01:54:02] <Cork> jquery is a array like object [1] returns the second member of the array
[01:54:11] <Cork> so the raw dom element
[01:54:16] <mozzarella> I see, now it works
[01:54:23] <mozzarella> what does eq stand for?
[01:54:27] <_jules_> well, ok I will just add another class :)
[01:54:29] <Cork> .eq(1) returns a new jquery object wrapping just that one element
[01:54:40] <_jules_> but out of curiosity, why it doesnt work like this?
[01:55:03] <Cork> _jules_: the string might not start exactly like you wrote or something
[01:55:11] <Cork> doens't really matter, it's a big no no
[01:55:24] <Cork> _jules_: what i meant is you can merge classes in selectors
[01:55:35] <Cork> so there isn't a reason to create compound class names
[01:55:54] <Cork> ex <span class="group-type-name"> .group-type-name {}
[01:56:05] <Cork> becomes <span class="group type name"> .group.type.name {}
[01:56:18] <Cork> its exactly as specific as the old one
[01:56:27] <Cork> but you can only select .group.type if you want to
[01:56:39] <_jules_> ah ok, now I understand
[01:56:49] <_jules_> Thank you :)
[01:56:52] <Cork> np
[02:01:03] <wast> I am doing iframe-contents-find. Find is looking only for tags or IDs. Is it possible to search text within iframe with regexp, and then add event onlick for only those regexp?
[02:01:48] <wast> I couldn't find answer on stackoverflow
[02:02:30] <Cork> wast: it would be very expensive
[02:02:41] <Cork> as you would have to find each element search for the text
[02:02:48] <Cork> then possibly check its children
[02:02:55] <Cork> and search for it's text again
[02:02:55] <wast> its not a large iframe
[02:03:12] <Cork> do you know what element type contains the text?
[02:03:17] <wast> and i know those IPs are within <b> tags, but not only IPs are within <b>
[02:03:42] <Cork> you could do .find('b:contains(string)')
[02:03:52] <wast> well
[02:03:54] <wast> i didnt try that
[02:04:06] <wast> while string is new RegExp ?
[02:04:11] <Cork> though if you have to use a variable i would use .filter instead (it is what :contains does internally)
[02:04:13] <Cork> no
[02:04:46] <Cork> you could do .find('b').filter(function() { return /[a-z]/.test($(this).text()); });
[02:06:43] <wast> hm let me google filter(), one moment :)
[02:07:44] <Uhkis> ?api filter
[02:07:44] <b-ot> Uhkis: .filter(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.  http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[02:07:45] <wast> ok, won't this add event on whole <b> element which contains IP
[02:07:52] <wast> ?
[02:07:52] <Uhkis> b-ot > google ;)
[02:07:53] <b-ot> Uhkis: Sorry, no results for ‚Äü;)‚Äù.
[02:07:57] <Uhkis> lol
[02:08:23] <wast> because thats how i understood that line
[02:08:39] <Cork> wast: no .filter isn't an event handler
[02:08:40] <Cork> its a filter
[02:08:46] <wast> i know
[02:09:03] <Cork> ah, you want to add and event on the actual text?
[02:09:07] <wast> yes
[02:09:09] <Cork> no that isn't possible
[02:09:13] <Cork> text isn't elements
[02:09:23] <Cork> so they can't cause events
[02:09:33] <Cork> you would have to add extra elements to the page for that
[02:09:35] <mozzarella> now, why is $("player_div").html("test"); not working?
[02:09:38] <mozzarella> oops
[02:09:50] <mozzarella> forgot the #
[02:09:53] <wast> :D
[02:09:53] <Cork> :)
[02:10:09] <wast> Cork, then i need to replace text and manually add a href
[02:10:14] <wast> and that worked well
[02:10:24] <wast> but, i lost other event listeners from that iframe
[02:10:34] <Cork> O_o
[02:10:35] <wast> and thats my proble
[02:10:36] <wast> m
[02:10:42] <Cork> don't run it on the body...
[02:10:46] <Cork> run it on the b element
[02:10:55] <Cork> else ya, you will effectively replace the entire page
[02:11:17] <wast> well, i didnt manage to do it like that
[02:11:30] <wast> sec
[02:11:30] <Cork> run the filter i gave you before
[02:11:37] <Cork> then run .html() on the result
[02:11:54] <Cork> wrap the text area you want with a the element tags you want
[02:12:05] <Cork> and then set it back with .html(newContent)
[02:12:44] <wast> moment, i will find that script in a minute
[02:12:58] <wast> as far as i remember, i did it something like this
[02:13:05] <wast> with .html()
[02:13:08] <wast> 1 minute
[02:16:50] <wast> $("iframe").contents().find("b").html(function(_, html) {
[02:16:50] <wast> return html.replace(/(\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\b)/, '<a href="http://$1/" target="_blank">$1</a>');
[02:17:11] <wast> did u mean like that?
[02:17:34] <Xatenev> Heya,  anybody familiar with https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF jsPDF?
[02:17:37] <wast> i think not, because this takes all html, changes, and replaces
[02:20:26] <Xatenev> Cork: maybe u can help me with that - I got a warning now: "JsPDF Warning: provide a callback to fromHTML!
[02:20:35] <Xatenev> I would appreciate help from anybody else aswell though
[02:20:52] <Xatenev> while this is my function http://pastebin.com/YLs8JaVQ
[02:21:11] <Xatenev> i am not sure if i understand the warning correctly :|^^
[02:21:12] <mozzarella> can I¬†pass a function to .html()?
[02:22:23] <Uhkis> Xatenev: the warning is pretty clear
[02:22:49] <doug16k> mozzarella, yes: http://api.jquery.com/html/#html-function
[02:22:51] <Xatenev> Uhkis: ay, but i never do JS and dont know what to change my function to :|
[02:22:51] <Xatenev> :p
[02:22:54] <Xatenev> sorry=(
[02:24:52] <Xatenev> yea well
[02:24:58] <Xatenev> i solved the warning by adding the callback func
[02:25:05] <Xatenev> now the warning is gone but my problem isnt gone :|^^
[02:25:18] <Uhkis> so  you didn't bother with the examples?
[02:25:44] <Xatenev> Uhkis: I used exactly the examples code
[02:25:46] <wast> https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF/blob/master/examples/basic.html
[02:25:49] <Uhkis> examples callback runs only this: pdf.save('Test.pdf');
[02:25:49] <wast> did u check those?
[02:26:40] <Xatenev> I used examples code but it doesnt seem to work though :p
[02:26:48] <Xatenev> i will copy all my code, sec
[02:27:14] <Xatenev> $('.download-wrapper').click(function () {
[02:27:14] <Xatenev>    var doc = new jsPDF();
[02:27:14] <Xatenev>    var specialElementHandlers = {
[02:27:14] <Xatenev>       '#editor': function(element, renderer){
[02:27:14] <Xatenev>          return true;
[02:27:15] <Xatenev>       }
[02:27:15] <Xatenev>    };
[02:27:16] <Xatenev>    doc.fromHTML($('.row .col-xs-9').get(0), 20, 20, {
[02:27:16] <Xatenev>       'width': 170,
[02:27:17] <Xatenev>       'elementHandlers': specialElementHandlers
[02:27:17] <Xatenev>    }, function() {
[02:27:18] <Xatenev>       console.log("test");
[02:27:18] <Xatenev>    });
[02:27:19] <Xatenev>    doc.save($('.row .col-xs-9 h3').text() + '.pdf');
[02:27:24] <mozzarella> how do I get the width and height of the object? http://fpaste.org/188052/42442801/
[02:27:32] <Uhkis> ...
[02:27:37] <Xatenev> it didnt copy the link ><
[02:28:15] <Cork> ?paste @ Xatenev
[02:28:15] <b-ot> Xatenev: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:28:20] <Cork> don't paste code in the channel
[02:28:41] <mozzarella> how do I¬†get them? (¬†¬†;____;)
[02:28:56] <Xatenev> Cork: I know.
[02:29:05] <Xatenev> I wrote the link no?
[02:29:12] <Xatenev> I accidently copied all my code but wrote the link afterwards..
[02:29:17] <Xatenev> cause it didnt copy the code first of all
[02:29:20] <Xatenev> the link*
[02:29:28] <Xatenev> (11:27:36) Xatenev: http://jsfiddle.net/v7vf4oe5/
[02:29:39] <Cork> i don't see any at least
[02:29:46] <mozzarella> never received that
[02:29:49] <Xatenev> Well, it got throttled due to flooding then aswell :X
[02:29:58] <Xatenev> cause i accidently wrote the code into channel, sorry^^
[02:30:39] <Xatenev> ha i got somtehing working
[02:30:41] <Cork> mozzarella: you would have to get a hold of the video element
[02:30:52] <Xatenev> had to put the doc.save into the callback function
[02:30:55] <Cork> or what width/height are you talking about?
[02:31:09] <mozzarella> Cork: the width of the div prior to putting the video in it
[02:31:16] <Cork> ah
[02:31:22] <mozzarella> I don't want to stretch it out
[02:31:22] <Uhkis> Xatenev: yeah, that's what i sad 5mins ago
[02:32:16] <Cork> mozzarella: you would have to ask the $('#player_div')
[02:32:35] <Xatenev> Uhkis: yea i done that now :p
[02:32:39] <Cork> .html is given a string so there isn't any function local variables there
[02:32:50] <Xatenev> workd gud - didnt see it in the examples though
[02:32:57] <Xatenev> I just saw examples running no callback function
[02:33:10] <Xatenev> thanks anyways
[02:33:26] <wast> cork did u see my line above?
[02:34:49] <Cork> wast: most likely no
[02:35:12] <mozzarella> Cork: this is what I get, lol: http://i.imgur.com/ePKi2jx.png
[02:35:42] <Cork> ya, you give n object to merge into the string
[02:35:59] <mozzarella> http://i.imgur.com/ePKi2jx.png
[02:36:01] <mozzarella> oop
[02:36:04] <mozzarella> $("#player_div").width
[02:36:10] <mozzarella> what kind of object is that?
[02:36:37] <Chanchal> hello
[02:36:51] <mozzarella> do I need to get width from the DOM object instead?
[02:38:19] <wast> number?
[02:38:41] <mozzarella> no
[02:39:03] <Cork> mozzarella: var player = $('#player_div'); player.width() player.height()
[02:39:38] <Cork> right not you wrap an unrelated element in a jquery object and convert the function to a string
[02:41:54] <mozzarella> Cork: I thought width and height were properties and not functions?
[02:42:19] <Cork> jquery doesn't have any properties except .fn
[02:53:57] <wast> Cork may i query u ?
[03:16:34] <KamalKaur> How can I focus on the first invalid field of error class?
[03:16:55] <KamalKaur> which is returning errors on submitting the form
[03:17:27] <Dzejmskrokan> KamalKaur:
[03:17:36] <Dzejmskrokan> ups didn't want to do that
[03:17:58] <KamalKaur> Dzejmskrokan: No problem. I thought my question was not clear :P
[03:18:12] <KamalKaur> Dzejmskrokan: So, you have a solution to my problem?
[03:19:41] <Dzejmskrokan> nope, know very little of jQuery :( I'm here to see what kinda of problems people get in and to see things they do some examples and stuff ;p
[03:21:41] <KamalKaur> Dzejmskrokan: Not bad!
[03:26:44] <sahbeewah> KamalKaur: your question isn‚Äôt clear
[03:27:23] <KamalKaur> sahbeewah: We submit forms, right? When there are any invalid fields, those are marked red/errors are shown, right?
[03:27:54] <KamalKaur> So, I want .focus() on the first invalid field.
[03:28:19] <KamalKaur> Have tried this: jQuery('[class$="error"]:first').focus();
[03:28:29] <KamalKaur> sahbeewah: BUt it doesn't seem to work
[03:28:49] <sahbeewah> there‚Äôs a class selector‚Ä¶
[03:29:13] <sahbeewah> so, $(‚Äò.error‚Äô).first().focus() would work
[03:29:40] <sahbeewah> $(‚Äò.error:first‚Äô).focus(), same thing
[03:30:36] <KamalKaur> sahbeewah: Nothing happened :(
[03:31:09] <Cork> KamalKaur: what does console.log($('.error').length) give you?
[03:31:22] <Cork> sahbeewah: your client replaces ' with ë
[03:31:32] <Cork> check if you can disable that
[03:32:59] <wast> Cork here's my example http://jsfiddle.net/0nwvj6xw/
[03:33:21] <wast> without jquery, IP is not link
[03:33:48] <wast> and click on link "10" is opening a popup (in real website)
[03:34:11] <wast> after jquery replaces html, nothing happens on click at link "10"
[03:34:39] <KamalKaur> Cork: It says undefined
[03:35:20] <Cork> wast: http://jsfiddle.net/0nwvj6xw/2/
[03:35:27] <Cork> undefined?!?
[03:35:44] <Cork> KamalKaur: if that's the case $ isn't jquery
[03:35:48] <wast> Cork, i will try this, thx
[03:36:01] <KamalKaur> Cork: Means?
[03:36:17] <Cork> KamalKaur: try console.log(jQuery('.error').length)
[03:37:21] <KamalKaur> Cork: THats also undefined
[03:37:36] <Cork> where are you running this?
[03:37:47] <KamalKaur> Cork: Browser console
[03:38:07] <Cork> ah, you should run it from where you run the check after submit
[03:38:52] <KamalKaur> Cork: Where will the output be shown then?
[03:38:58] <Cork> in the console
[03:39:01] <Cork> console.log <--
[03:39:59] <KamalKaur> Cork: It says: 0
[03:40:26] <Cork> KamalKaur: then you're either running before the class has been set, or the class has a different name
[03:41:09] <KamalKaur> THe class has same name, even I;ve set CSS for the same class which shows the fields marked red, as I've defined
[03:41:28] <Cork> KamalKaur: then you're running before the class has been added
[03:41:43] <KamalKaur> Cork: Will it be added after the form?
[03:42:17] <KamalKaur> Cork: IT returns 2 :-o
[03:42:27] <KamalKaur> After keeping it below the form ends
[03:43:35] <KamalKaur> Cork: BUt still not focusing
[03:43:50] <sahbeewah> stupid osx mavericks replaces quotes by default, fixed now, thanks Cork
[03:44:57] <KamalKaur> I'm gettign the number of errorss in console, but unable to see focus
[03:51:10] <Cork> KamalKaur: ya, cause the focus is in the console
[03:52:05] <KamalKaur> Cork: After closing console, it shold work?
[03:52:24] <Cork> i don't think you can change focus while the page isn't focused
[03:52:27] <Cork> but not fully sure there
[03:53:29] <Cork> anyway testing focus code from the console is error prone
[03:55:10] <KamalKaur> No, Not testing from console
[04:01:55] <doug16k> you can force element state to :focus or :hover etc, in chrome
[04:02:06] <doug16k> right click the element in Elements
[04:02:25] <doug16k> probably only affects css though, not sure
[04:03:19] <doug16k> KamalKaur, when you say "...unable to see focus" you mean get the callback, or literally see as in visual change
[04:06:19] <doug16k> stepping in the debugger does cause infinite focus loops
[04:07:19] <doug16k> the element legitimately gets focus, then the debugger breaks in, and it loses focus, but the event loop freezes. then later you eventually finish stepping and resume, your js gets the blur and focus again, causing it to break in again, etc
[04:08:27] <doug16k> in a perfect world, focusing the debugger wouldn't count. unfortunately that isn't how it works
[04:09:35] <doug16k> we're lucky it works as well as it does, considering you are debugging the program using the programs window
[04:15:04] <wast> Cork your solution works, thanks!
[04:36:23] <neredsenvy> var td = $('td input[name=gender]'); will return input field if it fiends a td with input but is there a way to have it return the td instead. So look for a td that has input[name=gender] somewhere in it ? Without using .parent() ?
[04:37:18] <sheepasdfghi> since there isn't any activity in #document-clound ... maybe you guys can help me, at least backone uses jquery ... - backbone Router question: i have a route for app/#test. if the user navigates to /#test, i do not want the browser to keep track of that paticular route in the history, how do i delete a single history entry?
[04:46:04] <bl4ckdu5t> If you scroll a bit down this page, you'll see as the fixed header passes the logo, it is z-indexed over the header. I want it to stick to the header from that point and also become fixed
[04:46:26] <bl4ckdu5t> I don't want to use stickyjs plugin. Any easy way to do that by explanations?
[04:46:29] <Cork> neredsenvy: $('td input[name="gender"]').closest('td')
[04:46:32] <bl4ckdu5t> http://josephrex.me/
[04:46:48] <neredsenvy> Thanks mate
[04:46:52] <prohobo> stupid javascript
[04:46:55] <prohobo> is stupid
[04:49:27] <prohobo> it's Cork's fault
[04:52:50] <kwladyka> another script do $('.btn_cart_250').click() on element and i have to remove this from this element. how can i do that?
[04:55:36] <Cork> kwladyka: $('').off('click'
[04:55:44] <Cork> though it will remove all click handlers
[04:55:59] <Cork> kwladyka: also note .click() and .click(func) isn't the same thing
[04:56:01] <kwladyka> Cork thx!
[04:56:11] <Cork> so you asked something other then you intended
[04:56:37] <kwladyka> ofcourse $('.btn_cart_250').click(function(){
[05:17:56] <MikeD_> is it possible to capture an uncheck event?
[05:19:31] <MikeD_> this is a mock of what I have now, but the customer wants unchecked radio section to have the checkboxes reset
[05:19:35] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/nux4fej6/
[05:20:51] <tralalathetroll> hello
[05:21:04] <MikeD_> hi
[05:21:30] <tralalathetroll> i feel like the math behind jquery is secret
[05:21:39] <MikeD_> what math?
[05:21:49] <tralalathetroll> the function math
[05:22:27] <MikeD_> it's not secret - you can read the source if you want
[05:23:10] <MikeD_> admittedly, being allowed in the kitchen doesn't mean you understand what the cook is doing... but it's not secret
[05:23:24] <sacho> what function math?
[05:23:33] <tralalathetroll> well it seems to be secret
[05:24:11] <nisseni> I'm using jquery to give an element a class on window scroll. However, on iOS - Chrome, this call is initiated after the scroll has been done - any workaround on this?
[05:24:24] <tralalathetroll> for example, I have a file jquery.easing.1.3 im using, its an easing function....and I know math, took calc 1 and 2...got a's..im not a retard....but in looking through these easing functions. it seems a lot more secret than a fucking kitchen ok bud
[05:25:01] <MikeD_> are you looking at minified code?
[05:25:06] <tralalathetroll> THIS:   easeInOutQuart: function (x, t, b, c, d) {
[05:25:06] <tralalathetroll> 		if ((t/=d/2) < 1) return c/2*t*t*t*t + b;
[05:25:06] <tralalathetroll> 		return -c/2 * ((t-=2)*t*t*t - 2) + b; ......................IS NOT blatant
[05:25:28] <tralalathetroll> What the hell is this! how do i begin to understand that! thats ridiculous!
[05:26:00] <tralalathetroll> theres like 40 functions in this 1 easing file....and there all NOT DEFINED...its like fucking sanskrit.what the fuck is this!
[05:26:48] <tralalathetroll> how do you begin to learn this?  these 6 variables:  easeInBack: function (x, t, b, c, d, s) {    what are they? where is that defined?
[05:27:38] <tralalathetroll> this is like algebra 2 on crack
[05:27:46] <sacho> ....what are you talking about?
[05:27:58] <sacho> that's not part of jquery.
[05:28:02] <tralalathetroll> JQUERY mathematical functions
[05:28:19] <MikeD_> idk, that looks like a simple function ... it takes in some parameters... you don't like the names of them, but whether they are "x" or "theobjectformerlyknownasX" doesn't make a bit of difference.
[05:28:21] <tralalathetroll> it's an EASING function written in JQUERY. how is that not part of jquery
[05:29:17] <sacho> tralalathetroll, that's not anywhere in jquery's source.
[05:29:25] <MikeD_> tbh, it's somewhat senseless to try to convince someone with "troll" right in their nick  :)
[05:29:42] <tralalathetroll> im tra la la the troll theres a difference
[05:29:51] <tralalathetroll> this is a function being written with JQUERY? how is it not?
[05:30:01] <tralalathetroll> these are the variables:  t: current time, b: begInnIng value, c: change In value, d: duration
[05:30:02] <tralalathetroll> jQuery.easing['jswing'] = jQuery.easing['swing'];
[05:30:20] <tralalathetroll> then it gives you functions, like 20of them, like this:
[05:30:21] <tralalathetroll> 	easeOutQuart: function (x, t, b, c, d) {
[05:30:21] <tralalathetroll> 		return -c * ((t=t/d-1)*t*t*t - 1) + b;
[05:30:39] <tralalathetroll> thats absurd! what is this *t*t*t? what?
[05:30:54] <sacho> it's multiplication. you learn it in school.
[05:31:08] <tralalathetroll> why is it multiplying it like that?
[05:32:10] <tralalathetroll> does anyone understand wtf this means>: easeOutQuint: function (x, t, b, c, d) {
[05:32:10] <tralalathetroll> 		return c*((t=t/d-1)*t*t*t*t + 1) + b;
[05:32:47] <sacho> sure.
[05:34:02] <tralalathetroll> http://upshots.org/actionscript/jsas-understanding-easing
[05:36:08] <tralalathetroll> why is the time being multiplied so many times? why not just write 4t?
[05:36:24] <sacho> it's not 4t.
[05:36:28] <sacho> that would be (t+t+t+t)
[05:37:30] <tralalathetroll> then why isnt it t^4
[05:37:58] <sacho> probably performance reasons
[05:37:58] <MikeD_> because whoever wrote that function didn't write it that way
[05:38:38] <MikeD_> i think you have a better case arguing "why assignment operator inside the return function?"  (not clear)
[05:38:59] <MikeD_> or what is /= operator?
[05:39:10] <tralalathetroll> the whole thing is baffling
[05:39:25] <tralalathetroll> where is the transition in connecting to understand this math
[05:39:26] <MikeD_> well you are reading someone else's code
[05:40:02] <MikeD_> and there's a reason to use a well-tested library, if it works you don't need to look under the covers
[05:40:33] <tralalathetroll> it works, i just want to know how it works to write my own shit. and i find its a very secret world to tap into
[05:41:04] <MikeD_> s/secret/confusing
[05:41:34] <MikeD_> if it was a secret you wouldn't know how confusing it is :)
[05:42:43] <tralalathetroll> doing algebra 2,geometry, calc, those were all easy. this jquery math  what can you do,  its parameters I feel is this freedom I dont understand....like this function is busting out PI and sin an cosin, like what? where is the core of how that makes sense.
[05:43:22] <tralalathetroll> Like if I wanted to use Jquery, and grab a Div, and make it go up, down, and then slowly fade....that seems to have 20 functions attached with this easing function like wtf?
[05:44:06] <tralalathetroll> it seems like a lot of excessive annoying bullshit the way its written, these functions.  this easing file is 20 functions of just bullshit like come on bro are you serious?
[05:44:27] <MikeD_> so don't use that file
[05:44:41] <sacho> tralalathetroll, http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/penner_chapter7_tweening.pdf
[05:45:13] <tralalathetroll> im just saying the core of how people are using jquery, this seems ridiculous how many functions being used to accomplish near idiot tasks
[05:47:08] <MikeD_> I use jquery, i don't use easing at all.
[05:47:14] <sacho> it's hard to understand what exactly you want to say.
[05:48:38] <MikeD_> btw, it's not "written in jquery" it's written in javascript... jquery is a library of helper functions... blahblahFoo plugins are extensions to core... but they are written by all skill levels... so you get the good and the bad of a large community.
[05:52:32] <tralalathetroll> ok heres my issue...in taking math classes the defined application of problem solving seemed more realistic, relatable. I find that if I could use math then and that way proficiently, why is there this gap in truly understanding javascript functions...like its medium of a web page, theres some gap somehow in understanding the usage of functions in javascript
[05:54:12] <MikeD_> maybe you are overthinking it?
[06:01:12] <MikeD_> do you think this a copacetic solution?  http://jsfiddle.net/nux4fej6/1/
[06:02:01] <SargoDarya> I have a question regarding $.extend. From what I gathered from the docs it won't overwrite a value in my destination object if the source object has a property with a null value. That doesn't work though. Fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/f7z04nr7/
[06:02:17] <SargoDarya> It overwrites everything so I end up with an empty object instead.
[06:02:24] <SargoDarya> Or rather an object which only holds nulls
[06:03:19] <tralalathetroll> copacetic solution for what mike d
[06:04:09] <shanee> Hello. I'm trying to post a form with ajax to a remote server I don't control. I always get a message about cross origin issues. However it seems to work OK (other than no response) for most browsers. Has anyone here done this kind of thing before?
[06:04:24] <MikeD_> clicking from another list to clear checkboxes in the other lists
[06:04:31] <shanee> Does IE9 for example still post the data correctly to domain names which are on another domain name?
[06:05:14] <tralalathetroll> yeah thats copacetic
[06:05:22] <SargoDarya> Can noone say anything about extend?
[06:05:29] <MikeD_> SargoDarya: http://jsfiddle.net/f7z04nr7/1/ ?
[06:05:38] <SargoDarya> exactly
[06:06:08] <SargoDarya> Oh wait, I think I understand what was meant.
[06:06:09] <SargoDarya> damn it.
[06:06:13] <SargoDarya> When two or more object arguments are supplied to $.extend(), properties from all of the objects are added to the target object. Arguments that are null or undefined are ignored.
[06:06:19] <SargoDarya> Misunderstood the last sentence.
[06:06:41] <SargoDarya> It's not applying to the individual keys, but the arguments which are passed to extend
[06:07:07] <MikeD_> not sure what you were hoping to have result
[06:07:48] <SargoDarya> Merge obj2 into obj1, but skip all values which are null or undefined.
[06:09:03] <tralalathetroll> have you ever accomplished a 3d perspective with jquery functions?
[06:09:10] <SargoDarya> huh?
[06:09:20] <SargoDarya> What do you mean by 3D perspective?
[06:09:35] <tralalathetroll> making things warp or scale with mouse over movement
[06:09:52] <SargoDarya> You can simply set a class and then do CSS3 animation magic
[06:09:54] <tralalathetroll> to push past a div
[06:10:24] <SargoDarya> Otherwise you would need some kind of transformation matrices.
[06:11:37] <tralalathetroll> have you ever written a transformation matrix?
[06:12:31] <MikeD_> SargoDarya: could you merge all your objects together then look for null/undefined on the result and delete those properties?
[06:13:58] <MikeD_> i feel like the keys/properties existence is the important part, so even with a null or undefined the key should be brought to the final object
[06:14:07] <SargoDarya> MikeD_: That's not what I want. Lets assume I have obj1 and obj2. Both have the key firstName. obj1.firstName is John, obj2.firstName is null
[06:14:36] <SargoDarya> If I now merge obj2 into obj1 I want it to ignore the null on obj2 so it will still be john
[06:14:37] <MikeD_> oh, i get it.
[06:14:49] <MikeD_> i don't think that's the intention of .extend
[06:15:49] <SargoDarya> Yeah, that's what I guessed.
[06:15:56] <SargoDarya> Need to roll a custom solution I guess
[06:16:03] <MikeD_> it's more like finalOptions = $.extend( applicationdefaultOption, instantiationdefaultOption, methocallOption );
[06:17:17] <MikeD_> a custom merge function that works like you want is pretty straightforward
[06:17:18] <SargoDarya> $.extend modifies the first object given
[06:18:00] <MikeD_> have you used .reduce()?
[06:18:45] <SargoDarya> Yes, not sure how that would help me in this case though.
[06:19:22] <MikeD_> yeah, nm... was thinking how i'd write that merge on an array of objects
[06:20:50] <delboy1978uk> i click on a span and need to check what the text says in the contained html. however there is also a fontawesome tag too, which i'd like to ignore, any easy way to do this?
[06:20:56] <delboy1978uk> example text:
[06:21:16] <delboy1978uk> "<i class="fa fa-cancel"></i> Disabled"
[06:23:25] <delboy1978uk> hmm i'm guessing just stick it in its own span or something? then find() it?
[06:23:44] <MikeD_> make a fiddle
[06:23:52] <Cork> delboy1978uk: no there isn't
[06:24:08] <delboy1978uk> ok cheers
[06:24:09] <Cork> delboy1978uk: you would have to clone the entire element, remove the elements you don't want and then grab the rest
[06:24:13] * delboy1978uk fiddles
[06:24:23] <Cork> delboy1978uk: check so there isn't a class on the parent element
[06:24:28] <Cork> might be enough
[06:24:50] <Cork> delboy1978uk: you could also do a :contains() selector for the "Disabled" text
[06:24:58] <Cork> but if possible i recommend to avoid that
[06:43:08] <delboy1978uk> this done the trick, although i still had to wrap the text itself in a span:
[06:43:11] <delboy1978uk> var html = $(this).html(); var status = $(html).not('i').html(); alert(status);
[06:45:36] <tty> hi. can i have a $(document).ready(function(){ ‚Ä¶} and an $.ajax({ ‚Ä¶ }).done(function(html){‚Ä¶.}); on parallel?
[06:46:08] <sacho> tty, what are you trying to achieve?
[06:46:21] <paulvd> how can i set a value to a password field ?
[06:46:27] <paulvd> um
[06:46:53] <paulvd> the value doesn't matter
[06:47:10] <Cork> same as any other input field
[06:47:20] <Cork> well except file

[07:04:43] <game0> heyo people, I'm trying to call another application in another domain using jquery ajax but the problem is that my application isn't allowing me to communicate with it
[07:05:33] <Cork> game0: the server has to respond to the OPTION request
[07:05:43] <Cork> like i said the last time you asked
[07:05:49] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[07:05:53] <doug16k> :D
[07:05:57] <Dr-007> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.nl/2013/09/jquery-cross-domain-ajax-request.html
[07:06:00] <b-ot> Cork: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[07:06:16] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#The_HTTP_response_headers
[07:06:48] <doug16k> TL;DR the server has to say it is ok to do cross browser request. you should read it though
[07:06:51] <Cork> game0: if you can't modify the server to do this, it won't be possible to do the cors call
[07:06:55] <doug16k> crossdomain I mean
[07:07:41] <doug16k> you can proxy through your backend if you must
[07:08:15] <Cork> doug16k: its running from file:// to localhost :)
[07:08:26] <Cork> so... not likely :D
[07:08:37] <doug16k> yeah, not good
[07:09:05] <Cork> ya, crossing the file boundary is never fun
[07:09:35] <doug16k> file:/// is more of a joke than something usable
[07:09:54] <doug16k> for obvious reasons
[07:10:10] <Cork> doug16k: tell that to the corporate developer world
[07:10:22] <Cork> its heavily used there
[07:10:29] <Cork> (with unc)
[07:10:46] <doug16k> and hacky things that generate json files? seen that before
[07:10:55] <Cork> http://server1/site/url/path linking to file:////server2/path/file.iso
[07:10:56] <doug16k> jsonp*
[07:11:55] <Cork> or file:////server2/path/file.html or...
[07:12:39] <Cork> and ppl wining over why file:// // <-- is needed for unc access
[07:12:44] <Cork> *sigh*
[07:14:35] <bl4ckdu5t> doug16k: here's where I'm using that. It doesn't seem to be doing oanything on scroll event http://josephrex.me/
[07:15:33] <tty> i want to addClass on a div depending on window.location.href. should i use $(document).ready(function(){
[07:15:36] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm trying to make that JR logo stick to the header on meeting it. It has a class fixed which is fixed
[07:15:54] <doug16k> tty, yes, to ensure that the div exists first
[07:16:01] <bl4ckdu5t> trying to change it's class to fixed when it meets that point
[07:16:30] <doug16k> it's class to fixed?
[07:16:53] <bl4ckdu5t> yes. The first was just a sample reduced testcase
[07:16:56] <doug16k> you really mean class or are you thinking .css('display', 'fixed')
[07:17:10] <doug16k> wait position, not display
[07:17:10] <bl4ckdu5t> I changed that to fixed
[07:17:18] <bl4ckdu5t> position yes
[07:17:29] <bl4ckdu5t> class fixed has a position: fixed;
[07:17:33] <doug16k> ok
[07:18:15] <bl4ckdu5t> Don't know if you can still view out of the minified code but here it is http://josephrex.me/assets/app-fe42b76b323b850fbde17c792311e605.js
[07:18:32] <bl4ckdu5t> I replaced 147 with 10 also
[07:18:32] <doug16k> bl4ckdu5t,  Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[07:19:11] <doug16k> bl4ckdu5t, check the debugger console frequently, particularly when something doesn't work
[07:19:52] <bl4ckdu5t> I suspect the toggleClass() is the problem
[07:19:58] <bl4ckdu5t> I don't have jQuery there
[07:20:14] <doug16k> modern raw js has classList.toggle
[07:20:33] <bl4ckdu5t> I asked that I wanted that to be translated into vanilla JS
[07:21:09] <doug16k> you can load a classList polyfill if you must support old browsers
[07:21:16] <doug16k> then use the modern classList api
[07:21:19] <bl4ckdu5t> This http://pastie.org/9965859
[07:22:18] <bl4ckdu5t> ok I've been a dick for not wanting to use jQuery on this one website. It's been a pain
[07:22:42] <doug16k> by the time you write all the helper code you need, you might as well use fully debugged jquery lib
[07:22:50] <bl4ckdu5t> Can't I just do without it. I've done everything without it and now this makes me run back
[07:23:03] <doug16k> I just told you what to do
[07:23:13] <doug16k> and it is nearly as easy as jquery
[07:23:17] <doug16k> it is equally easy
[07:23:34] <doug16k> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.classList
[07:23:37] <bl4ckdu5t> ok will try that out
[07:24:48] <doug16k> https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js/blob/master/classList.js seems good
[07:25:14] <doug16k> load that before your script if you need old browser support. makes the modern code work on old browser
[07:26:08] <doug16k> google "classlist polyfill" and look around though
[07:26:22] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm using latest version of chrome and I just want to test first. Do you think this should work?
[07:26:25] <bl4ckdu5t> http://pastie.org/9966081
[07:26:28] <doug16k> oh yes
[07:26:34] <doug16k> anything not old will handle classList
[07:26:46] <doug16k> mainstream es5 html5 good browsers I mean
[07:27:02] <bl4ckdu5t> ok
[07:28:03] <bl4ckdu5t> did you look through my last paste?
[07:28:33] <doug16k> looking...
[07:28:57] <doug16k> in raw js, the "on" should be "addEventListener"
[07:29:18] <doug16k> and remove the () after scrollTop
[07:29:27] <doug16k> I thought you wanted it converted TO jquery
[07:29:52] <bl4ckdu5t> ok
[07:32:27] <JohnDow> I'm using jquery validation plugin from http://jqueryvalidation.org/ and i need help in error placement, as i'm having a hard time trying to understand in the documentation
[07:32:43] <JohnDow> this is the normal form http://i.stack.imgur.com/Av9Ke.png
[07:33:02] <JohnDow> and this is what it do when it has an error http://i.stack.imgur.com/sCZyO.png
[07:33:56] <JohnDow> i already specified a place for the error in my html, and i want it to stay there but since it's empty it doesn't take space
[07:34:27] <JohnDow> even if i use height to make an empty div to take a space, the plugin just messed it up.. i need help
[07:34:32] <JohnDow> that's all... anyone?
[07:35:12] <doug16k> JohnDow, use .hide() and .show() for that
[07:35:28] <Omar-> JohnDow use errorReplacement, $('form').validate({ errorPlacement: function (error, element) { if (element.is(input)) { element.before(error); } });
[07:35:33] <doug16k> that .hide() makes it take no space and makes it practically nonexistent for some purposes
[07:35:55] <doug16k> it doesnt' spend time doing layout in descendents of display: none elements
[07:37:00] <JohnDow> i dont want the error's container or whatever element it use to hide when it has no error... i just want the text to hide so it does not mess up my layout
[07:37:16] <doug16k> use .hide()
[07:37:23] <doug16k> to hide. surprise! :)
[07:38:01] <JohnDow> may i see a jsfiddle sir if you dont mind?
[07:38:04] <doug16k> the other way is to toggle a certain class name, typically "hidden"
[07:39:07] <elrafael> evening. there is a way to capture something like this?
[07:39:50] <BillCriswell> elrafael: An empty string?
[07:39:59] <elrafael> lol
[07:40:01] <elrafael> sorry
[07:40:32] <elrafael> $('div#content a, div#menu a').on('click', function() { ..... });
[07:40:49] <elrafael> i wanna test if the click came from div#content a or div#menu a
[07:41:34] <BillCriswell> You can use $(this).closest('#content').length or $(this).closest('#menu').length
[07:42:32] <elrafael> hum, good tip. i'll try
[07:43:03] <MikeD_> if a collection has no member elements can I use mycollection.each() on it?  ( $.each() throws an error on an empty array )
[07:43:38] <BillCriswell> elrafael: http://jsbin.com/jivudutapu/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:43:40] <elrafael> BillCriswell: thank you so much. i forgot the closest. worked. thank you!
[07:43:48] <BillCriswell> elrafael: Glad it worked.
[07:44:11] <elrafael> :)
[07:45:45] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Hmm..I don't get an error with an empty array.
[07:46:11] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: http://jsbin.com/socojapixe/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:47:00] <doug16k> BillCriswell, Object.keys(obj).forEach(function(key) { var value = this[key]; ... }, obj);
[07:47:43] <doug16k> or $.each(Object.keys(obj), function(i, key) { var value = obj[key]; ... })
[07:48:06] <doug16k> oops I mean MikeD_ ^^^
[07:48:07] <BillCriswell> doug16k: I'm not seeing the relation. =(
[07:48:11] <BillCriswell> Oh ok haha.
[07:48:15] <doug16k> sorry
[07:48:24] <BillCriswell> Yeah I wouldn't use .each unless it was $collection.each()
[07:48:58] <tty> is there a wildcard for case 'http://192.168.3.5/':
[07:48:59] <tty> ?
[07:49:13] <BillCriswell> tty: Is that a full question?
[07:49:15] <doug16k> to really bulletproof it, use Object.keys(obj || {})
[07:49:27] <tty> BillCriswell: not yet.
[07:49:33] <tty> i want to catch http://192.168.3.5/path1 and http://192.168.3.5/path2
[07:49:43] <tty> i am using a switch
[07:50:17] <tty> maybe with regex?
[07:50:20] <BillCriswell> So you want any path to match with that ip?
[07:50:58] <BillCriswell> tty: I'd do url.split('/')[2] === '192.168.3.5'
[07:51:02] <MikeD_> i don't think you can use switch like you are and have the cases be regex
[07:51:24] <BillCriswell> tty: Are you just trying to switch solely based on the ip?
[07:51:36] <MikeD_> switch( true ){ case (/.*/).test( foo ) }  ?
[07:51:39] <tty> BillCriswell: i want the case to be valid for whatever url on i want to catch 192.168.3.5
[07:51:59] <MikeD_> why not remove that part before entering the switch?
[07:52:00] <Soopaman> be sure you escape the .
[07:52:37] <tty> BillCriswell: yes
[07:52:42] <tty> no
[07:52:53] <tty> i want i want to catch http://192.168.3.5/wordpress/*
[07:53:47] <BillCriswell> var ip = url.split('/')[2]; will give you the IP for every url you just shared.
[07:53:50] <Soopaman> switch( true ) { case /^192\.168\.3\.5\/wordpress/.test(url): alert("I match your condition"); break; }
[07:54:36] <BillCriswell> switch (ip) { case "192.168.3.5": console.log('Yo'); }
[07:54:38] <Soopaman> if it always comes in as http you can check for that aswell
[07:55:03] <doug16k> Soopaman, why not just 'if' statement
[07:55:40] <tty> Soopaman: current case is
[07:55:45] <tty> case 'http://192.168.3.6/wordpress/*':
[07:55:45] <tty> $('.wp').addClass('active');
[07:55:46] <tty> console.log('wp');
[07:55:47] <tty> break;
[07:55:55] <BillCriswell> I must be missing something.
[07:56:14] <tty> sorry no *
[07:56:19] <tty> case 'http://192.168.3.6/wordpress/':
[07:56:37] <tty> Soopaman: what is test(url) ?
[07:58:13] <doug16k> you want to hardcode it to the ip you have now?
[07:58:22] <doug16k> so when it changes all the code is broken
[07:59:55] <Soopaman> so you'd start with /^http(s)?\:/\/\/192
[08:00:07] <tty> doug16k: yes. the ip will remain the same. the character next to wordpress/ will change
[08:00:41] <Soopaman> doug16k: a switch true case is cleaner and more flexible when your conditions expand
[08:00:57] <Soopaman> tty: url = 'http://192.168.3.6/wordpress/';
[08:01:37] <BillCriswell> tty: http://jsbin.com/socojapixe/2/edit?html,js,output this might be useful to you.
[08:01:44] <BillCriswell> Shouldn't need a regex for this.
[08:01:54] <Soopaman> regex is for the children!
[08:01:57] <Soopaman> ;)
[08:02:06] <BillCriswell> No, wu-tang is for the children.
[08:02:14] <tty> BillCriswell: not sure. wordpress will have various permalinks once you login
[08:02:29] <Soopaman> BillCriswell: nice pick up ;)
[08:02:40] <tty> http://192.168.3.6/wordpress/wp-login.php, http://192.168.3.6/wordpress/page1, http://192.168.3.6/wordpress/page2, etc
[08:02:51] <BillCriswell> tty: Right.
[08:02:56] <Soopaman> you can further extract it incase the ip changes
[08:03:05] <Soopaman> rather abstract it
[08:03:19] <Soopaman> 'cause it sounds like you may be writing an internal url router
[08:03:38] <tty> i just want to addClass(‚Äòactive‚Äô) on a navigaiton bar
[08:03:39] <tty> :)
[08:03:42] <tty> cc Soopaman
[08:03:52] <Soopaman> lol
[08:03:53] <BillCriswell> Jesus.
[08:04:06] <Soopaman> what overkill
[08:04:18] * Soopaman gracefully bows out
[08:04:41] <Soopaman> sorry I just realized I was in jquery and not one of my node chans
[08:05:00] <Soopaman> easiest way, unless you are generating the urls on the fly
[08:05:13] <Soopaman> is to use a href attribute selector with the url in it
[08:05:32] <BillCriswell> tty: $('a').filter(function () { return this.href === location.href; }).addClass('here');
[08:06:17] <tty> BillCriswell: Soopaman: the navigation has href 1 to 192.168.3.6/wordpress, href 2 to 192.168.3.5/ etc
[08:06:29] <tty> i load the same html/css/js on both servers.
[08:06:34] <Soopaman> $('a[href="'+url+'"]').toggleClass("active")
[08:07:04] <BillCriswell> tty: $('a').filter(function () { return this.href.pathname === location.pathname; }).addClass('here'); ?
[08:07:23] <Soopaman> urlMap { "1": "..3.6", "2": "..3.5" /*etc*/ }
[08:07:43] <tty> a var urls like this may do? http://jsbin.com/socojapixe/2/edit?js,output
[08:07:45] <Soopaman> either way I think BillCriswell has this well in hand
[08:07:58] <Soopaman> great day ya'll!
[08:08:02] <BillCriswell> Soopaman: Later dude.
[08:08:07] * Soopaman flies away
[08:08:08] <tty> Soopaman: thanks
[08:08:12] <Soopaman> np
[08:08:13] <Soopaman> peace
[08:08:39] <Soopaman> ( \ / \ / )
[08:09:21] <tty> BillCriswell: This is the js. i also set timeout because sometimes the class was not added. http://pastebin.com/exWCx8pN
[08:09:37] <tty> the last case was case 'http://192.168.3.6/wordpress/':
[08:09:51] <tty> skip that slideToggle.
[08:10:38] <BillCriswell> What is .ba and .ms, classes on links?
[08:10:54] <tty> on <li>
[08:11:04] <tty> i can put them on links
[08:12:18] <Omar-> any moderator on forum.jquery.com?
[08:13:26] <BillCriswell> tty: Ok. You can do $('a').filter(function() { return this.href === location.href; }).addClass('active'); if it's on the link. If it's on the parent <li> you can do $('a').filter(function() { return this.href === location.href; }).parent().addClass('active');
[08:14:01] <BillCriswell> So replace that entire switch with that.
[08:15:06] <BillCriswell> If you just want to do it based on the first sub directory you can do: $('a').filter(function () { return this.pathname.split('/')[1] === location.pathname.split('/')[1]; });
[08:15:28] <BillCriswell> So that'll cover your /wordpress case
[08:15:57] <psykrsna> Hi people, what is a neat plugin to use for google like suggest?
[08:16:18] <psykrsna> I should be able to add it to any text box without having to change styling much.
[08:16:49] <BillCriswell> psykrsna: What are you suggesting? Strings from an array?
[08:17:36] <psykrsna> Yes I have the string array with the suggestions.
[08:17:55] <psykrsna> I just want a plugin that hooks in the UI part of it.
[08:18:17] <tty> BillCriswell: the li in here: http://pastebin.com/7ypS856Q
[08:18:35] <psykrsna> The showing under the text box, the highlighting when a user presses down arrow, etc.
[08:18:41] <bear_> Hello, I'm trying to run one line of javascript before executing the other. For some reason this doesnt work: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6dd8d74666e8be479e25 Can anyone help me?
[08:18:41] <BillCriswell> psykrsna: There's jQuery UI auto complete. Twitter typeahead as well.
[08:18:56] <BillCriswell> tty: Why is your html set up like this?
[08:19:11] <tty> why not?
[08:19:39] <tty> i wanted the <li> to be a button like. not just a link on text.
[08:19:39] <psykrsna> BillCriswell, oh Twitter typeahead was just what I was looking for. Thanks much!
[08:21:45] <BillCriswell> tty: but...
[08:48:26] <Omar-> any moderator on forum.jquery.com?
[09:16:07] <game0> heyo guys, I'm new to jquery programming and I need to enable only cross sharing in the client side
[09:16:16] <game0> my code is placed here:
[09:16:46] <game0> cork
[09:17:16] <converge> I have this jquery error, can anyone help me? http://paste2.org/_v0UAXj35
[09:17:27] <game0> http://pastebin.com/fPvyFRLk
[09:18:39] <Es0teric> can anyone help me with this real quick? i am using selectizejs and i want the "name" field to populate on the input http://jsfiddle.net/b40yawwd/2/
[09:18:49] <Evolutio> include this "<script src="js/fortunata.js"></script>" after you include jquery
[09:19:01] <Evolutio> @converge
[09:19:49] <Evolutio> and when the error is still there add a "http:" before the "//ajax"
[09:22:18] <Cork> game0: like i've already told you, the server control this
[09:22:31] <game0> Yeah, I did enable it
[09:22:42] <Cork> if client could control it, the entire feature would be pointless
[09:23:04] <game0> butXMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8085/alfresco/service/hello. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 500.
[09:23:05] <zoro1971> i think <script src="js/fortunata.js"></script> should be after jquery
[09:23:16] <Cork> game0: there isn't anything more to do if the server responds correctly to the header
[09:23:18] <Evolutio> me too
[09:23:40] <game0> but I saw this blog
[09:23:41] <game0> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/
[09:23:45] <game0> cork
[09:24:33] <Cork> game0: that's if you need to use basic auth
[09:27:19] <game0> can we change my code to this way cork?
[09:28:16] <Cork> game0: what way?
[09:28:24] <Cork> game0: the change needed is on the server side
[09:28:30] <Cork> there isn't anything you need to change client side
[09:28:49] <game0> cork, nothing in the HTML?
[09:29:02] <game0> you mean this code for server side right?
[09:29:05] <Cork> game0: the response header is so the browser won't block you
[09:29:24] <game0> yes, this is what I mean?
[09:29:25] <robertmaxrees> game0 the webserver software needs to be reconfigured.
[09:29:34] <robertmaxrees> not HTML or javascript.
[09:29:35] <Cork> if the response header is there the browser won't block you and things work
[09:29:43] <robertmaxrees> apache, nginx, etc.
[09:30:02] <game0> This will be in the client or server side?
[09:30:06] <robertmaxrees> server.
[09:30:25] <Cork> the third party server the one on... localhost:8085
[09:30:34] <Cork> if i remember correctly
[09:31:22] <game0> OK, thanks cork robertmaxrees
[09:31:30] <game0> I will see that
[09:31:34] <robertmaxrees> game0 the whole thing is pretty easy to envision - suppose for a second you came to my website and I setup a script that, via ajax, went to mail.google.com.  because you visited the page, it would access it as if you were logged in.
[09:31:50] <robertmaxrees> i could then theoretically download your email.  that wouldn't be a very good thing, right?
[09:31:54] <Cork> game0: or like i said before, move the local file to the localhost server, and none of this will be needed
[09:32:12] <Cork> its by far the simplest and most efficient solution
[09:32:20] <robertmaxrees> and the most secure.
[09:34:09] <Cork> robertmaxrees: for backhistory he is trying to access localhost:8085 from file://c|/.../something.html
[09:34:21] <Cork> post to rather
[09:34:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not gonna work.
[09:34:30] <robertmaxrees> well, it could but i wouldn't do it.
[09:34:36] <Cork> ya, same here
[09:34:43] <robertmaxrees> there's an extra layer of browser security that prevents that iirc.
[09:34:52] <BillCriswell> Would need some flags in chrome set for that to work.
[09:34:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[09:34:58] <BillCriswell> I had that flag enabled for a while. =(
[09:35:03] <BillCriswell> Not a bright move haha
[09:37:33] <Cork> its scary how common it is in the corporate world for doing http => file cross calls
[09:37:37] <IVBakker> can someone help me, I want to animate the background of a row in a table. For now I do: $('#line_'+sport_code+' td').animate({backgroundColor,new_color},1000); but it doesn't change anything and doesn't print error
[09:37:52] <robertmaxrees> IVBakker animating things in tables is asking for pain.
[09:38:19] <BillCriswell> IVBakker: animate() won't animate color changing without jQuery UI I don't think.
[09:38:26] <BillCriswell> I'd just use CSS at this point, though.
[09:38:28] <robertmaxrees> that doo.
[09:38:31] <Evolutio> IVBakker
[09:38:39] <Cork> IVBakker: also its {backgroundColor:color} or  ('background-color', color)
[09:38:48] <Cork> not {backgroundColror,color}
[09:38:49] <IVBakker> Cork, yeah sorry, small typo
[09:39:19] <Cork> IVBakker: also color animations is part of jquery-ui if i remember correctly
[09:39:29] <IVBakker> ok, it was just for test, so I guess I won' t do it
[09:39:48] <Cork> but ya, just do it with css3 its the simplest
[09:40:06] <Cork> and smoothest
[09:40:18] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/vohitarene/1/edit?html,css,output real quick
[09:41:04] <IVBakker> BillCriswell: Smooth! let me get an eye on that
[09:41:04] <BillCriswell> A color can transition from inherit but a width can't from auto. =(
[09:41:26] <Cork> BillCriswell: ya, i hate that
[09:41:51] <Cork> its among the most common animations, and the one animation not supported :/
[09:42:14] <fatmandown> Hey guys, having an issue here with Safari. My same-site AJAX get request isn't pulling the file
[09:42:24] <BillCriswell> Cork: YEah kind of stinks.
[09:42:41] <fatmandown> It's an RSS file, and it's in the same directory as the file making the AJAX call. It works in chrome, ff, ie, but not in safari
[09:43:05] <Cork> fatmandown: test with an absolute path
[09:43:24] <Cork> (meaning starting from the root of the server /path/path/resounse-name.rss
[09:45:03] <Cork> fatmandown: might also be that safari reacts to the content-type of the rss feed
[09:45:21] <Cork> so you could try playing with that and see if it makes a difference
[09:46:09] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/vohitarene/2/edit?js,output that's fun
[09:46:56] <BillCriswell> I bet I could make it a game to get them all highlighted and sell it on the app store.
[09:48:17] <Cork> flappy-rows? :D
[09:48:24] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/vohitarene/3/edit who's going to be the first to win?!
[09:48:43] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:50:30] <BillCriswell> This game is hard.
[09:51:26] <Evolutio> BillCriswell i dont understand the game
[09:51:33] <Cork> XD
[09:51:54] <BillCriswell> Evolutio: You push the button till they're all red.
[09:52:02] <Evolutio> they are all red
[09:52:09] <Evolutio> after the 3 push
[09:52:20] <BillCriswell> Evolutio: Oh I removed a bunch of the rows.
[09:52:28] <BillCriswell> I had like 20 there at first.
[09:52:40] <Evolutio> huuh, with 2 it's easy
[09:52:40] <Evolutio> xD
[09:52:47] <BillCriswell> True.
[09:53:20] <IVBakker> I won!
[09:55:19] <fatmandown> Cork: no dice
[09:55:32] <fatmandown> tried absolute path, relative path, straight URL to the xml file
[09:55:34] <fatmandown> it's just not loading it
[09:55:57] <Cork> and if you use something like a .json file instead?
[09:56:00] <Cork> just as a test
[09:56:43] <Cork> {"works":true}
[09:56:53] <Cork> should be enough for content :)
[09:57:08] <arthurvr> Hi everybody! What‚Äôs going on today?
[10:02:26] <robertmaxrees> not much arthurvr - fighting against adobe's satellite system.  how're you?

[10:06:38] <weems|mac> is there a jquery method to lock a mouse scroll wheel?
[10:06:42] <weems|mac> and where can I find it, if so
[10:07:15] <Cork> weems|mac: lock the wheel??
[10:07:30] <Cork> locking the cursor i could understand but the wheel??
[10:07:31] <weems|mac> so that when I attempt to scroll the page using the middle wheel
[10:07:40] <weems|mac> the page does not move
[10:07:56] <Cork> why would you want to break expected user experience?
[10:07:58] <weems|mac> I have a use case on my own page when I do not want the user to move the page as it is a fixed calendar
[10:08:03] <MikeD_> middle wheel?  how many wheels you got?
[10:08:09] <weems|mac> okay yeah
[10:08:13] <weems|mac> its just the mouse wheel
[10:08:18] <weems|mac> sorry :p
[10:08:20] <robertmaxrees> lol you know what he meant ;)
[10:08:21] <MikeD_> :) j/k
[10:08:22] <arthurvr> MikeD_: lol
[10:08:35] <weems|mac> its pimp my jquery with 6 wheels
[10:08:36] <weems|mac> lol
[10:08:36] <Cork> weems|mac: so just disable the scrolling
[10:08:47] <weems|mac> Cork: is that a function?
[10:09:00] <Cork> html, body{ overflow: hidden; }
[10:09:25] <weems|mac> I only want to do it for one element so it would be optimal for js/jquery
[10:09:42] <weems|mac> $(''div) or something
[10:09:44] <MikeD_> what if i mouse over the scrollbar and click the down arrow thing?
[10:09:57] <weems|mac> thats fine
[10:10:01] <Cork> weems|mac: so you mean if the cursor is over a specific element you want to prevent the scroll action?
[10:10:02] <weems|mac> the main issue is the wheel
[10:10:08] <weems|mac> yes
[10:10:10] <Cork> ah
[10:10:16] <MikeD_> that's a completely different issue than blocking one of several hardware behaviors
[10:10:21] <Cork> that makes some more sense
[10:10:22] <weems|mac> oh well then
[10:10:24] <weems|mac> :p
[10:10:40] <Cork> weems|mac: bind a mousewheel event on the div
[10:10:47] <Cork> and call event.preventDefault()
[10:10:48] <weems|mac> ok

[10:42:44] <saransh__> hi, how to pass a dynamic url as src attribute?
[10:44:04] <saransh__> suppose my url is url: http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/dynamic/02311/Chatara2_2311607g.jpg  and I have to pass it as src: url. then how can I do that?
[10:44:13] <robertmaxrees> "as a src: url" where?
[10:44:17] <robertmaxrees> for an image?
[10:44:19] <saransh__> yes
[10:44:27] <robertmaxrees> check out .attr() and .prop()
[10:44:29] <Evolutio> $('img').attr('src', 'http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/dynamic/02311/Chatara2_2311607g.jpg');
[10:44:44] <saransh__> how to convert http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/dynamic/02311/Chatara2_2311607g.jpg  to 'http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/dynamic/02311/Chatara2_2311607g.jpg '
[10:45:19] <robertmaxrees> saransh__ you're being vague - do you have a code example?
[10:45:25] <saransh__> yes,
[10:47:53] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: https://code.hackerearth.com/cd20d2P
[10:48:18] <robertmaxrees> blank screen...
[10:49:00] <robertmaxrees> could you use something like fixee.org or jsfiddle.net instead?
[10:51:45] <saransh__> robertmaxress: sorry, https://code.hackerearth.com/25f3eby?key=80a129e4f1059f02a0b56189b744b871
[10:52:10] <robertmaxrees> same story.  blank page.
[10:52:12] <robertmaxrees> please use fixee.org.
[10:53:52] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: http://fixee.org/paste/2komq70/
[10:54:25] <robertmaxrees> just remove those quotes from around that value.

[10:54:38] <robertmaxrees> the quotes are implied within the string, so you don't need them.
[10:56:54] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: thanks, how can I convert it into slider?
[10:57:07] <robertmaxrees> a carousel?
[10:57:14] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: yes
[10:57:21] <robertmaxrees> carousels are generally a bad idea.
[10:57:27] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: why?
[10:57:33] <robertmaxrees> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[10:57:36] <robertmaxrees> this explains it.
[10:57:45] <robertmaxrees> you can get away with them sometimes, but not usually.
[10:58:14] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: actually It's kind of important so
[10:58:28] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: I need to  use carousel here
[10:58:34] <robertmaxrees> i would still advise against it.  if you absolutely need one, use a plugin.
[10:58:36] <robertmaxrees> don't build it yourself.
[10:58:55] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: I was writing code by myself till now
[10:59:22] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - don't reinvent the wheel :)
[10:59:45] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: yes okay :)
[10:59:54] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: any better ideas?
[11:00:00] <robertmaxrees> don't use a carousel lol
[11:00:07] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, use a plugin to make it.
[11:00:57] <saransh__> robertmaxrees: yes fine :)
[11:03:55] <zalg> anyone here lives in Quebec city?
[11:09:58] <converge> I want to update a input field after redirect, is this right? window.location = "http://pi/?my_field_id=teste";
[11:10:19] <NoiseEee> converge: i guess
[11:10:53] <NoiseEee> converge: as long as that page is prepared/scripted to put "teste" in "my_field_id"
[11:11:20] <converge> NoiseEee: I dont think its prepared, what else do I need..?
[11:11:35] <NoiseEee> converge: well im not sure what you're asking
[11:11:44] <NoiseEee> converge: how to make it automatically happen?
[11:12:27] <NoiseEee> your backend (or JS) would do it but yeah, its up to you to program your backend (or JS) to do it
[11:12:50] <converge> NoiseEee: Im at aaa.html and after click "ok" button, it uses windows.location = ""; to redirect to bbb.html, bbb.html have a html form and my_field input field
[11:13:48] <converge> after being redirected to bbb.html I wish my_field to be filled with "my new content"
[11:14:44] <NoiseEee> converge: well what code have you got so far?
[11:16:21] <converge> NoiseEee: http://paste2.org/_3ADBKIfC
[11:17:12] <converge> Idk if it's clear to understand
[11:17:58] <NoiseEee> converge: its clear, but nobody is going to write the code for you
[11:18:19] <NoiseEee> converge: if you posted code that showed you were on your way, youd' get help
[11:18:23] <converge> NoiseEee: I really don't want that, Im trying to understand what's going wrong
[11:18:34] <NoiseEee> converge: well nothings going wrong
[11:18:42] <NoiseEee> converge: there is no 'automatic' behaviour that does what you ask
[11:18:48] <NoiseEee> converge: you have to write that behaviour
[11:19:32] <converge> NoiseEee: ok, I thought it could be 'automatic'
[11:19:34] <converge> thank you
[11:20:14] <NoiseEee> no problem :)  good luck.  but if you plan to do this on the client-side, then write a script that grabs the query string and maybe puts it in key:value object, then you can look through the DOM for the key and update it with the value
[11:52:30] <ajf-> I'm generating an HTML table on the fly with LOTS of data using this method: var table = $('.table tbody'); $.each(data, function(i, col) { table.append('<tr>...</tr>'); }); My problem is that the data is so large that this actually pauses the execution of everything else until it is done in memory. How can I avoid this problem?
[11:56:32] <samssh> ajf-, One of the slowest things in JS is DOM access. Try this: instead of modifying .table in the DOM, remove it from the DOM before running all the appends. Then when you are done appending, re-attach the table to the DOM.
[11:57:38] <samssh> ajf-, Also, don't use .remove, use .detach() if you need to keep any handlers tied to .table.
[11:58:19] <ajf-> samssh: It's not in the DOM actually. I forgot to mention that part. It does it like this: var table = $('<table><tbody></tbody></table>');  tbody = table.find('tbody'); $.each( .... tbody.append... ); $('#element').append(table);
[11:59:14] <samssh> ajf-, Ok. Try concating all the tr level appends into one big string to append once.
[11:59:40] <ajf-> Trying that.
[12:00:02] <samssh> Also, if there are other DOM access made in the loop, see if you can pull them out..
[12:03:28] <ajf-> samssh: Alright... *seems to be* a little bit faster using a big string (var rows = ''; $.each(.....rows += '<tr>...';....).....; tbody.append(rows)) but almost unnoticeable
[12:04:02] <ajf-> see code here: https://gist.github.com/006ae30b2e699f0d6d76
[12:04:33] <ajf-> we are talking of an array with 1343 object
[12:04:39] <ajf-> *objects
[12:04:42] <ajf-> each representing a row
[12:06:01] <ajf-> Here's an idea: I'm building the whole table because I want to use that jQuery.DataTables plugin to initialise it afterwards, and it takes care of everything including pagination, etc.
[12:06:30] <ajf-> But maybe I can fill only about 30 rows, initialise the DataTable, and then keep adding the rest of the rows in the background
[12:06:41] <ajf-> not sure how to *run that in the background* though
[12:06:59] <samssh> ajf-, That is a lot of rows. Yeah, take a look at infinite scrolling implementations. Very similar.
[12:06:59] <ajf-> because DataTables supports adding rows after the table has been built
[12:12:43] <samssh> ajf-, Something you might want to look at if you don't need great legacy support is web workers.
[12:14:34] <ajf-> samssh: I'll try some setTimeouts that add 100 new rows each to the DataTable and separated by about 200ms and see how it goes. If that doesn't help, I'll go down the Web Workers route (lots of emphasis on old browsers here)
[12:22:14] <MikeD_> do you know why http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/ fails to save online?
[12:29:32] <arthurvr> MikeD_: for me it works
[12:52:57] <notchris> If I have a function in a global script
[12:53:13] <notchris> And I use ‚ÄúonClick‚Äù inside of an anchor to trigger the function
[12:53:23] <notchris> Can I reference the anchor clicked
[12:53:29] <notchris> Inside of the function
[12:54:03] <Cork> notchris: this will be the element clicked
[12:54:13] <Cork> notchris: though you should use event handlers not event attributes
[12:54:42] <notchris> Hmmm
[12:54:44] <notchris> var x = this.attr('href');
[12:54:53] <Cork> $(this)
[12:55:02] <notchris> Would get me the anchor url?
[12:55:14] <notchris> var x = $(this).attr('href');
[12:55:18] <Cork> this.href or $(this).attr('href') yes
[12:55:50] <Cork> well actually this.getAttribute('href') or $(this).attr('href')
[12:56:09] <notchris>         var postlink = this.href;
[12:56:10] <notchris>         var frameSrc = "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=".postLink;
[12:56:35] <notchris> or
[12:56:36] <notchris>         var frameSrc = "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u="+ postLink;
[12:56:43] <Cork> the later
[12:56:45] <notchris> :D
[12:57:00] <Cork> the first is semi php
[12:57:27] <notchris> Right
[12:57:39] <notchris> Can I get the data-target in the same waty?
[12:57:55] <notchris>      var postlink = this.data(‚Äòtarget‚Äô);
[12:57:57] <Cork> this is the dom element
[12:58:07] <notchris> Right
[12:58:19] <Cork> if you wrap it with jquery like $(this) you can use all the normal jquery functions
[12:58:21] <notchris> So: <a data-target=‚Äúx‚Äù>Hello</a>
[12:58:41] <notchris> var $postlink = $(this).data(‚Äòtarget‚Äô);
[12:58:58] <notchris> would make postlink = x
[12:58:59] <notchris> ?
[13:00:20] <NoiseEee> try it and see!
[13:03:54] <phelix> Anyone know how I can use Jquery to create a gradient background on hover ??
[13:04:24] <MikeD_> why do that when CSS already can?
[13:04:35] <Cork> phelix: absolutely best solution is to set the gradient with a class in css
[13:04:43] <Cork> and then just toggle the class with js
[13:05:08] <Cork> or ya, just use :hover in css
[13:05:18] <phelix> Yes, your right i forgot the most important item though.. I need it to transition on hover effect.
[13:05:26] <phelix> that is what makes doing that impossible.
[13:05:49] <Cork> ah
[13:06:04] <MikeD_> then definitely go with the .addClass() method
[13:06:05] <Cork> well impossible with css3
[13:06:14] <Cork> they are working on it for css4 though
[13:06:19] <phelix> yes impossible with a CSS3 only solution.. Hoping for a JQuery solution
[13:06:35] <phelix> that would be so nice.. its frusterating as many things I want to transition do not work with CSS3
[13:06:44] <Cork> phelix: you would have to look for a plugin to calculate the gradiant stops
[13:06:49] <Cork> only way to do a transition there
[13:06:50] <MikeD_> i'm not sure i like css having a lot of behavior coding
[13:07:06] <Cork> MikeD_: it isn't behavior
[13:07:22] <Cork> it is just logic for how to transition from two values
[13:07:40] <Cork> the logic would be in selectors or js just like before
[13:07:58] <Cork> basically it is a continuation of the transition property
[13:08:20] <phelix> hmm, not sure how I would even go about looking for that in JQuery. Its not something I have tried to do or ever created a gradient with jquery before.
[13:08:30] <Cork> but they bumped it last time cause it is tricky to get right
[13:09:18] <Cork> ?g jquery plugin animate gradient
[13:09:18] <b-ot> Cork: Animated Background Gradient - CodePen ‚Üí http://codepen.io/quasimondo/pen/lDdrF
[13:09:25] <Cork> :)
[13:09:50] <phelix> Ok, let me just try and ask this then. http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/37120.html Can you tell how they are doing it on this template?
[13:10:55] <phelix> I am trying to replicate this effect.
[13:11:35] <mbrzuzy> would class be an attribute or property?
[13:11:45] <Cork> simple
[13:11:51] <Cork> they animate the height of the element
[13:11:52] <decx> phelix:  use double wrapped buttons or :after/:before and fade in the highlight
[13:12:03] <decx> with transition and opacity
[13:12:14] <phelix> decx: I tried a type of hack that way and I wasn't able to get it working properly.
[13:13:06] <phelix> Cork: I made a 4 tier gradient so its basically one BG with the 2 gradients and used background-size:200%; and then background-position: to change it on hover and it works ok with transition except it slides up and down instead of fades in and out
[13:13:48] <Cork> phelix: sure, i've done that too, the answer was how "they" did it
[13:14:07] <phelix> yah, that is what I am trying to figure out.. how did they do it. I want to replicate it the same way they are doing
[13:14:33] <Cork> phelix: like i said, a static background image
[13:14:35] <phelix> how by animating the height are they able to look like it fades in and out
[13:14:41] <phelix> they are using a bgimage?
[13:14:43] <Cork> and then they animate the height of the element
[13:14:56] <Cork> gradient is an image too
[13:15:00] <Cork> just computer generated
[13:15:18] <phelix> they using js to generate a gradient image?
[13:16:00] <Cork> actaully no checking closer http://livedemo00.template-help.com/wordpress_37120/wp-content/themes/theme1421/images/thumb-bg.png
[13:16:22] <phelix> I dont think that is the correct image
[13:16:37] <phelix> for the main nav area? Where it says PC - XBOX360
[13:17:40] <Cork> yup that's the one i copied it from
[13:17:49] <phelix> Yea I can tell what they are doing down a ways where it says "LATEST" - XBOX-360" with the red line under. I am looking at the main nav at the very top with the large buttons.
[13:18:14] <Cork> ah no i was at the one above
[13:18:37] <Cork> so http://livedemo00.template-help.com/wordpress_37120/wp-content/themes/theme1421/images/tab-active-bg.png
[13:19:08] <Cork> anyway nothing special with what they're doing
[13:20:01] <phelix> Yea I am talking about the very top buttons.  PC XBOX360 Wii PS3 PSP 3DS in large letters directly under where the GAMEBOX logo
[13:20:35] <phelix> there is def some jquery doing some weird stuff as it disapears and the styles change really rapidly and can see the html changing from the firebug editor
[13:21:02] <Cork> doesn't really matter, they use the same technique for all of them
[13:22:21] <phelix> Well I am not able to see what is happening or what they are doing
[13:22:48] <Cork> phelix: they have an <i> element ontop of the normal element
[13:22:53] <Cork> it all happen there
[13:22:57] <Cork> just inspect the page
[13:23:30] <phelix> There is not an i element
[13:23:38] <Cork> there is
[13:24:42] <phelix> http://imgur.com/T5dU2VG
[13:24:53] <phelix> these are the buttons I am looking at. they don't have a i element
[13:27:35] <phelix> were def looking at different buttons. I see the ones you are talking about with that background image and the i element but not the buttons inside the top navigation area.

[14:12:40] <_DB> anyone here familiar with DatePicker ?
[14:12:48] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ _DB
[14:12:48] <b-ot> _DB: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:13:02] <_DB> I need to set the date to null
[14:13:54] <duch_kazatel> set null or "clear" the date?
[14:14:03] <_DB> clear it basically
[14:14:51] <duch_kazatel> there's an internal "clearDate()" methdo available.
[14:15:19] <duch_kazatel> *_clearDate() method.  i'd search around for it.
[14:15:35] <_DB> I used these $('#mform_end_d')._clearDate(this);  $('#mform_end_d').datepicker('setValue', null);   $('#mform_end_d').datepicker('setDate', null);
[14:15:54] <_DB> none of them worked
[14:16:20] <duch_kazatel> $('#input_field_goes_here').datepicker('setDate', null);
[14:16:27] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, $.datepicker._clearDate('#input_field_goes_here');
[14:16:36] <duch_kazatel> if neither of those work, i'll need a fiddle to play with.
[14:18:49] <_DB>  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '_clearDate' of undefined
[14:19:06] <duch_kazatel> $.datePicker._clearDate('#input_field_goes_here'); maybe?
[14:19:40] <_DB> same thing
[14:19:50] <_DB> I use this to set it $('#mform_start_d').datepicker('setValue', start_date );
[14:20:26] <duch_kazatel> yeah i'd need to see it then.
[14:20:42] <_DB> but when I do that the date becomes 31/12/1969
[14:21:02] <duch_kazatel> what's the actual problem you're trying to account for?
[14:21:17] <_DB> well I have a tab system with a edit button on each tab
[14:21:27] <_DB> when you press edit, it grabs info from server side
[14:21:39] <_DB> one of the info it grabs is start_date and end_date
[14:21:52] <_DB> if start_date is not set I want to clear the date
[14:22:10] <_DB> (because its keeping the info from the old tab I was editing)
[14:22:23] <duch_kazatel> hrmm...
[14:22:32] <wast> Cork thx again :D
[14:23:31] <duch_kazatel> _DB yeah not sure without playing with it.

[15:27:44] <afmza> hi guys, is there a problem with jquery ui dialog opening at the bottom of the page in the latest release?
[15:37:18] <Cyndre> Hi, I am playing with expanding divs on click with the animate function and I was wondering if their was a way to detach that function from the div so it doesnt fire after its expanded
[16:32:27] <lando23> hey guys was wondering if anyone else is experiencing odd intermittent jsbin refresh problems?
[16:33:09] <lando23> I‚Äôm testing out page refresh stuff, but it‚Äôs not workin http://jsbin.com/zokijo/1/edit?html,js,output
[16:38:31] <_eddy> guys. I have page and i want to slide it right so it looks like you are opening page in a book
[16:38:42] <_eddy> so when you click on a link it should open it
[16:41:18] <robertmaxrees> _eddy okay.  what about it?
[16:41:40] <robertmaxrees> lando23 woooah.
[16:41:44] <robertmaxrees> don't use eval fwiw.
[16:41:48] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[16:45:06] <lando23> i‚Äôd like to verify that there is an inconsistency with the edit version and the share version on jsbin.
[16:45:24] <robertmaxrees> there will be, yes-ish.
[16:45:27] <lando23> http://jsbin.com/zokijo/edit?html,js,output vs http://jsbin.com/zokijo
[16:45:39] <lando23> have you looked at those two urls?
[16:45:43] <robertmaxrees> open your browser's console.
[16:45:55] <robertmaxrees> and what you're trying to do is really unusual.
[16:45:58] <robertmaxrees> eval() is part of the issue.
[16:46:05] <lando23> you are wrong.
[16:46:11] <robertmaxrees> oh okay.
[16:46:12] <lando23> It‚Äôs a jsbin problem.
[16:46:14] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[16:46:16] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:46:43] <robertmaxrees> fwiw http://jsbin.com/zorotalehi/1/edit seems OK
[16:48:37] <lando23> interesting. that‚Äôs old code. i don‚Äôt think my browser is actually updating my bin, which means that the other tab is seeing the same old code you are.
[16:48:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:49:01] <robertmaxrees> oh that's what you mean.
[16:49:24] <robertmaxrees> i put the js into the javascript pane and am explicitly calling window.location.reload() instead of using eval()
[16:49:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/jugodatube/1/edit?html,js,output maybe this'll work?  jsbin's funky imo.
[16:52:16] <lando23> thanks for your help. somethings up with jsbin and or my computer. i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a javascript or jq problem.
[17:31:26] <_eddy> guys how do I shorter that line http://jsbin.com/koqufocobe/1/edit?html,css,output
[18:18:03] <Caspan> If i am trying to make a DIV show by using $( "#RightClickMenu" ).show(2000);
[18:18:19] <Caspan> but it wont show.. its initial style is hidden
[18:19:09] <Caspan> if i use this  '  document.getElementById('RightClickMenu').style.visibility='visible';  ' it will show the DIV
[18:19:28] <Caspan> I am just trying to make it look a little nicer but sliding out
[18:19:30] <Caspan> by
[18:19:37] <Caspan> any ideas?
[18:25:37] <Caspan> NM Guess I have to use Display none not hidden
[20:15:51] <kilks> can someone please help me to find out what is wrong in this file? http://pastebin.com/HiAqtQra
[20:16:12] <kilks> I am trying to hide text
[20:16:46] <kilks> inculded jquery file is in same directory
[20:21:09] <slipfish> I've got a really dumb question that hopefully has a really smart answer. I have an array of uri's that I need to make some ajax get requests with, I need to chain each request and do something when they're all done.
[20:21:25] <slipfish> I don't know how many uri's there will be
[20:22:32] <slipfish> So, I can't do a blah().then(blah2).then(blah3), can I?
[20:23:25] <slipfish> Better question, how do I use promises on an unknown amount of calls.
[20:31:02] <Wolfed> I am having a logical thinking issue while making a filter, not sure if anyone could be willing to give me a hand, already getting a headache with this one: http://jsfiddle.net/8yug4sLb/
[20:31:56] <Wolfed> I'm making a filter where you can filter with an "or" condition (instead of an "and"/exclusive), which works fine when picking filters, but when I "remove" a filter it breaks up and shows everything again.
[20:32:48] <Wolfed> Filtering by "Living" and "Comedor" and then removing one of the filters might be a better explanation as to what seems to be not working as intended.
[20:46:32] <Velveeta> kilks: you misspelled "function" on line 5
[20:47:26] <Velveeta> slipfish: if you don't know the number of uri's, you'd probably be better off implementing some kind of processing queue
[20:48:09] <slipfish> Velveeta: after some googling, I found this: http://jsfiddle.net/YNGcm/21/
[20:48:18] <slipfish> It seems to work fairly well.
[20:49:02] <Velveeta> that would work also, but doesn't process them sequentially, it processes them simultaneously
[20:49:19] <Velveeta> so yeah, if you want all of those requests to kick off at the same time, that's what i would recommend, just calling $.when.apply
[20:49:33] <Velveeta> if you want one fetch to not occur until the previous one has finished, you'd want a queue
[20:50:39] <slipfish> What I'm doing is a bunch of ajax calls to get an html dataType, and popping a modal with the html results. I can sequence them afterwards.
[20:51:04] <slipfish> I just needed to know when to pop that modal
[20:52:08] <Velveeta> yeah, if all you're worry about is that they're all complete, and they don't need to process sequentially, then that $.when.apply method is ideal
[20:53:31] <Zlepper> Hello. I have some code which for some odd reason has decided to not work: "body = $("<div />").text(question).html();". If the question variable is "hello" then the value of the body variable will become "hello", not "<div>hello</div>". What could be causing this? This piece of code is working just a few lines longer up in my code.
[20:55:57] <Zlepper> Or as a jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/nLzd9k7n/
[20:56:58] <shoky> Zlepper: .html() just gives you the .innerHTML of the element. .prop('outerHTML') would get you the outer
[20:58:45] <Zlepper> Odd, but thanks shoky
[21:03:31] <Wolfed> height: 0; visibility: hidden; <-- Is that considered :visible?
[21:03:42] <Guddu> Could someone please tell me if in JQUery this is a single line of code?
[21:03:43] <Guddu> $('.standard.test.modal')
[21:03:43] <Guddu>   .modal('show')
[21:03:43] <Guddu> ;
[21:04:21] <shoky> Wolfed: yes
[21:06:00] <Wolfed> shoky, thanks, so visibility takes priority when defining :visible? How does it work if I use width: 0; and opacity: 0;? Same thing?
[21:06:40] <shoky> Wolfed: it's just for display:none i think
[21:07:09] <Wolfed> Guddu, from a debugging point of view, thats 3 lines, so I doubt it counts a single-lined code.
[21:07:21] <Guddu> Wolfed, And execution wise?
[21:08:03] <Wolfed> shoky, according to the documentation visibility: hidden and opacitiy: 0 are considered visible, but width:0 is considered as not visible, but I can't seem to get it to work
[21:08:25] <Wolfed> Guddu, execution wise, thats the same as $('.standard.test.modal').modal('show');
[21:08:39] <Guddu> Thaks Wolfed
[21:08:46] <shoky> Guddu jquery isn't a language and has no lines. that's considered 3 text lines, or 1 javascript statement, or 2 function calls
[21:12:33] <shoky> Wolfed it doesn't explicitly say that width:0 or height:0 means it's not :visible, dont remember what it actually checks there
[21:12:58] <Wolfed> true, but it does say Visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero
[21:13:22] <Wolfed> By logic, width: 0 = Not visible
[21:13:44] <Wolfed> I'll try another approach tho, since I can't seem to get it to work, thanks tho shoky
[21:15:52] <shoky> Wolfed: if both width and height are 0 it won't be :visible. the code checks if either one is > 0
[21:16:26] <Wolfed> Right, thats why it wasnt working. That clarifies it. Thanks
[21:16:34] <shoky> np
