[00:02:17] <bluesm> Is there a easy way to show something beneath ?
[00:02:23] <bluesm> of particular DOM element ?
[00:03:43] <tw2113> .after()
[00:06:16] <bluesm>  tw2113: And to not interfere with other elements i could make it "relative positioning" Right ? :)
[00:06:34] <tw2113> i would assume so, i can't guarantee at the exact moment
[00:06:36] <tw2113> ?after
[00:06:45] <tw2113> such slow bots
[00:09:38] <bluesm> tw2113: Ok thanks :)
[01:00:09] <bluesm> is the better way to check if element exists than:
[01:00:11] <bluesm> $(this).parent().find('.my_slider').length == 0
[01:00:12] <bluesm> ?
[01:07:51] <Nebros> I have there a little AJAX / Django question... I will give a variable from the page one, to the page two, loadet by AJAX. How i have to do this? Or what is missing? http://jsfiddle.net/6jrww/
[01:11:39] <xec> bluesm: using .length is fine, but you don't need to compare to 0 (0 is already falsy)
[01:12:18] <bluesm>  xec:  oky.
[01:54:03] <superdo> hi
[01:54:35] <superdo> any idea how to implemet Facebook Like button into a JQmobile page, If I load all pages with ajax?
[01:55:56] <superdo> my guess is I have to cheat with php, so make a route site.com/article/34 and pass to FB button
[01:56:17] <superdo> but is it a nice solution?!
[02:02:07] <bluesm> $(this).after('<div class="my_slider"></div>');   Why this return "$(this)"  ?
[02:02:29] <bluesm> Why not what I entered ?
[02:02:58] <Cork> bluesm: cause you might want to do something more with the original
[02:03:25] <Cork> var slider = $('<div class="my_slider"></div>'); $(this).after(slider);
[02:04:05] <Cork> bluesm: all functions return the original jquery selector or a none jquery value
[02:04:17] <Cork> like .attr or .prop
[02:06:38] <bluesm> Cork: Ok thank.
[02:06:48] <bluesm> Cork: i get used to "appendChild" method in JS ... So.
[02:07:09] <Cork> bluesm: ya, same here
[02:07:39] <Cork> appendChild needs you to create the node first though, just like i did with jquery there :)
[02:07:43] <bluesm> Cork: Same here ?
[02:08:03] <Cork> ah you get used to
[02:08:10] <Cork> i read that i'm more used to :)
[02:08:27] <bluesm> Cork: But appendChild return appended node , jquery "appender" return orginal
[02:08:59] <Cork> bluesm: ya, but jquery works a lot differently, in that it lets you chain things normally
[02:09:11] <Cork> js normally don't allow chaining
[02:09:22] <Cork> (natively that is)
[02:10:15] <bluesm> Cork: "chaining" = operate on the same element? After each called method.
[02:10:54] <Cork> $().css().html().show().animate()
[02:11:27] <avinashrbhat> is there any way that i could hijack the event handlers in jquery?
[02:11:40] <Cork> hijack?
[02:12:05] <bluesm> Cork:And every method return oryginal element. Right :)
[02:12:08] <bluesm> ?
[02:12:10] <Cork> yes
[02:12:22] <avinashrbhat> Cork: ya, i need to have a work around a bug http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=178146
[02:12:28] <avinashrbhat> in chromium
[02:12:51] <Cork> bluesm: an exception is .children(), find(), closest(), parents() and a few other
[02:13:19] <bluesm> Cork: Ok. Thank you very very much :)
[02:13:21] <Cork> avinashrbhat: just bind an event listener to it and do event.preventDefault()
[02:13:27] <Cork> bluesm: np
[02:13:33] <avinashrbhat> i cannot do that
[02:14:03] <Cork> you could bind an event listener on the document and see if the form submitting it is visible
[02:14:41] <avinashrbhat> but in the submit event calling ajax first
[02:14:49] <avinashrbhat> so my method will fail
[02:14:50] <Cork> $(document).on('submit', function(event) { if(event.target.is(':visible')) { event.preventDefault(); } });
[02:14:55] <avinashrbhat> in any case
[02:14:57] <Cork> ah
[02:15:02] <avinashrbhat> Cork: ya i got that
[02:15:04] <avinashrbhat> i tried
[02:15:08] <Cork> then you will have to have a check in your event handler
[02:15:14] <avinashrbhat> no
[02:15:17] <avinashrbhat> i cannot do that
[02:15:23] <Cork> then you can't fix it
[02:15:29] <avinashrbhat> too much code change every where
[02:15:37] <avinashrbhat> Cork: nice :-)
[02:15:55] <avinashrbhat> Cork: any way thx
[02:16:13] <Cork> you could replace the submit event with a custom event and then block events before you trigger the "special-submit" event
[02:16:25] <Cork> but you would have to replace all submit handlers to do that
[02:16:29] <Cork> so... not really a change
[02:16:30] <avinashrbhat> ya
[02:16:41] <Cork> hmm
[02:16:45] <Cork> actually...
[02:16:57] <Cork> you might be able to do it with custom
[02:17:17] <Cork> you would have to sniff for the problem though (not ua sniffing!)
[02:17:43] <avinashrbhat> Cork: sorry i didn't get you
[02:17:45] <Cork> and then you could add a custom event initializer for submit if it is
[02:18:14] <avinashrbhat> Cork: i was thinking about cssHooks in jquery, just like that is there a "eventHook" ?
[02:18:42] <Cork> avinashrbhat: you can add event types to jQuery.event.special
[02:18:49] <avinashrbhat> ok
[02:18:58] <Cork> it has callbacks for setup and teardown
[02:19:01] <avinashrbhat> thanks i'll go that way then
[02:19:12] <avinashrbhat> Cork: that will do i guess
[02:19:12] <Cork> in the setup you could use a wrapper and stop the events
[02:19:19] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/src/event.js
[02:19:25] <Cork> have a look at the bottom of that one
[02:19:34] <Cork> something like that should be possible to do
[02:19:54] <Cork> you could have to fiddle a bit to get it working though
[02:20:20] <avinashrbhat> Cork: yup, that may be the fix, thx
[02:33:55] <superdo> no idea on my question?
[02:37:42] <Cork> superdo: you would have to load the button through there normal api, and trigger it after you've added the content
[02:37:56] <Cork> you can't solve it through ajax
[02:38:21] <Cork> (or by proxying it over your own server, as that would lose the link to the visitors account)
[02:42:34] <superdo> Cork, i see, thx
[02:51:58] <phrearch> hey
[02:52:56] <phrearch> im trying to append data to the dom, like $('<div class="ctx-menu"></div>').html(tpl);
[02:53:22] <phrearch> should i bind it to the body tag instead? im not sure if anything gets added to the dom like this
[02:53:59] <postoy> use appendTo()
[03:04:51] <afflicto> I'm trying to get the css width value of an element, it's set to 0% but .css('width') returns '0px'. Why?
[03:05:12] <ravenzz> afflicto is your element hidden?
[03:05:22] <afflicto> nope
[03:05:36] <Anticom> morning all
[03:05:40] <ravenzz> can you arrange a testcase on jsfiddle.net?
[03:05:42] <Anticom> noob question here :D
[03:05:45] <ravenzz> Anticom morning
[03:06:22] <Cork> afflicto: use .width() not css
[03:06:29] <Anticom> when i got an object, what do i have to return in the .map callback to preserve the key-val pairs?
[03:07:17] <Cork> Anticom: map always return an array
[03:07:27] <afflicto> Cork: Wouldn't .width() return the actual computed width? I need the css percentage value.
[03:07:35] <Cork> ah
[03:07:49] <Cork> ok, then css should work
[03:07:55] <Cork> if the element has one that is
[03:08:07] <afflicto> Well, it is set to 0%
[03:08:19] <afflicto> 0% is still 0% and not 0px.
[03:08:21] <Cork> ah, well 0 is 0
[03:08:28] <afflicto> Right. let me try with 1%
[03:09:22] <phrearch> postoy: ok thanks
[03:09:49] <afflicto> It seems getting the percentage with is not possible. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/744319/get-css-rules-percentage-value-in-jquery
[03:11:17] <Cork> afflicto: well you can grab it from the styleSheets object
[03:11:23] <Cork> but ya, your better of just using px
[03:11:43] <ravenzz> you can always calculate it
[03:11:56] <Anticom> Cork $.map({key: 'val', key2: 'val2'}, function(val, key){ return val; }); --> ['val', 'val2']
[03:12:01] <ravenzz> just grab the parent width and make the calculation
[03:12:02] <Cork> ravenzz: that was what we talked about with px
[03:12:08] <ravenzz> ah k
[03:12:12] <Anticom> but i need {key: 'val', key2: 'val2'} as output again
[03:12:12] <Cork> Anticom: exactly
[03:12:17] <Cork> you can't
[03:12:21] <Anticom> :(
[03:12:26] <Cork> ?jquery.map
[03:12:26] <bot-t> jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[03:12:34] <Cork> to new array of items. <--
[03:12:44] <Anticom> well then i've got to use an object with a higher scope
[03:12:46] <Cork> you can return an array of object is you like
[03:12:54] <Anticom> nah
[03:12:55] <Anticom> ^^
[03:13:29] <Cork> Anticom: just use each and a new object
[03:14:05] <Anticom> that's exactly what i did now ;)
[03:14:10] <Anticom> but thx anyway Cork
[03:14:38] <Cork> ya, i've been there my self a few years back :)
[03:14:48] <Cork> would be nice to have a mapObject function
[03:15:05] <Cork> or mapToObject might actually fit better
[03:15:11] <Anticom> yup, i'll get my hands on that during lunch break
[03:15:29] <Cork> never really found a use for it
[03:15:37] <Cork> extend solved my needs most of the time
[03:15:52] <Anticom> let's say you've used serializeArray() to serialize a form and now you want to filter something
[03:16:13] <Anticom> that's about what i did.... i got all values from from elements now i only want to get those, where value is not emtpy
[03:16:34] <Cork> serializeArray gives you an array of objects
[03:16:39] <Cork> map handles that just fine
[03:17:07] <Anticom> i didn't use .serializeArray... there's another func doing somethign similar i belive
[03:17:53] <Cork> :) not if you don't get an array of [{ name: '', value:'' },{ name: '', value:'' }] :)
[03:18:47] <Anticom> why would you want to have an array like such?
[03:18:49] <Anticom> :D
[03:25:46] <zarac> What's up with el.data('foo', 'bar') not actually adding the data-foo attribute in the DOM? I have to do el.attr('data-foo', 'bar') if i want it in the DOM, which, of course, i do, since that's the whole point. Any thoughts? Is this a perhaps a bug?
[03:26:34] <zarac> e.g. $('body').data('foo', 'bar') will not allow a subsequent select on $('body[data-foo=bar]').
[03:28:40] <ohcibi> i have an ajax request which fails because the ip-adress of the target is wrong... how to know that this is the reason in the error handler?
[03:28:48] <ravenzz> zarac data() is not supposed to do that
[03:29:03] <ravenzz> if you want to add the attribute to the DOM element use attr()
[03:30:15] <zarac> ravenzz: Cool. So what's the point of .data then? And why does it read stuff from data-foo attributes?
[03:30:25] <ravenzz> data() attaches data to the DOM element, not an attribute
[03:30:45] <zarac> hmm..
[03:30:52] <ravenzz> data can be a js object for instance
[03:30:52] <zarac> how misleading and confusing. ; )
[03:31:27] <zarac> I guess that could come in handy too... I just assumed it worked 1-1 with data since that is it's name. ; )
[03:31:35] <zarac> Thanks.
[03:31:47] <zarac> s/it's/its
[03:31:47] <ravenzz> data-attributes values can be strings only
[03:32:00] <zarac> ah
[03:32:35] <zarac> I thought it was possible to do things like data-foo-bar="baz"
[03:32:41] <zarac> nm
[03:32:49] <zarac> forget i spoke. ; )
[03:32:51] <ravenzz> I mean <div data-foo='{ foo: "foo", bar: "bar"}'>
[03:33:02] <Nebros> how can i give 2 variables with ajax?      data: { kundendaten:1, variable:variable  },       i tried a bit, but i always become an error. ^^
[03:33:02] <ravenzz> { foo: "foo", bar: "bar"} is a string
[03:33:18] <zarac> yeah. that'd be <div data-foo-foo="foo" data-foo-bar="bar"> ..
[03:33:23] <Cork> Nebros: exactly like that
[03:33:35] <Cork> Nebros: what error do you get?
[03:33:44] <ravenzz> zarac it would be a mess I guess
[03:33:44] <Nebros> yes but how it looks when i will have 2 variables?
[03:33:57] <Cork> Nebros: like how you wrote it
[03:33:59] <zarac> ravenzz: yeah : )
[03:34:06] <Cork> Nebros: so what is the error?
[03:34:07] <Nebros> data: { kundendaten:1, variable:variable variable2:variable2 },
[03:34:14] <seutje> missing comma
[03:34:15] <Nebros> ?
[03:34:18] <Cork> ya
[03:34:23] <Nebros> -.-
[03:34:30] <Nebros> o man
[03:34:34] <ravenzz> zarac also you could have a key: function () {} pair
[03:34:49] <ravenzz> where the function body is pretty big...
[03:35:10] <zarac> ravenzz: Oh, using .data(), the value can be a function?
[03:35:16] <zarac> That could be handy too i guess. ;)
[03:35:25] <ravenzz> it has to be an object (which can contain a function)
[03:35:46] <zarac> but, functions are objects.. ? : 0
[03:35:49] <ravenzz> oh wait it can be anything I guess
[03:36:07] <zarac> awesome : )
[03:36:22] <ravenzz> the doc says
[03:36:23] <ravenzz> value
[03:36:24] <ravenzz> Type: Object
[03:36:24] <ravenzz> The new data value.
[03:36:40] <Cork> data can hold anything you can point a variable at
[03:36:47] <Cork> data() that is
[03:38:01] <Cork> $elm.data('j', $); $elm.data('j')('body').hide()
[03:38:03] <Cork> :)
[03:38:58] <ravenzz> yeah maybe I am wrong but the doc is misleading there
[03:39:26] <Cork> ravenzz: data() uses an object with the expando as a key
[03:39:43] <Cork> so anything you can point the value of the key towards will work just fine
[03:39:56] <ravenzz> sure
[03:40:05] <Cork> data- is another matter though
[03:40:12] <ravenzz> I know
[03:41:00] <ravenzz> the jQuery.data() page lack of this sentence "The new data value; it can be any Javascript type including Array or Object."
[03:41:13] <soee> hi, if i have some function defined to be called on ajaxComplete: $('body').on('ajaxComplete', function() - how can i make the same code to be executed when page is loaded without ajax calls ?
[03:41:25] <ravenzz> which is in the .data() one instead
[03:42:08] <Cork> soee: don't define it at an anonymous function and call it from load/ready too
[03:43:00] <soee> Cork, so i should define it as normal named function and than call it on ready and ajax complete ?
[03:43:08] <Cork> yes
[03:43:18] <soee> Cork, ok thank you for your help
[03:43:21] <Cork> ah wait your using $('body').on('ajaxComplete',
[03:43:28] <soee> yes
[03:43:47] <Cork> soee: try $(document).on('ajaxComplete load',
[03:44:12] <Cork> but ready needs to be called with the ready function so you can't use the event listener for that
[03:44:18] <Cork> load should work though
[03:47:14] <Nebros> this works:     return render_to_response('one.html', {'rows_1': rows_1}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))         this works not:     return render_to_response('one.html', {'rows_1': rows_1}, {'link':link}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))          error: TypeError at /split/render_to_string() got multiple values for keyword argument 'context_instance'     what i have to change?
[03:47:58] <Cork> ?p @ Nebros
[03:47:58] <bot-t> Nebros, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:48:10] <Nebros> kk
[03:48:28] <wassup> Nebros: {'row_1': rows_1, 'link': link}
[03:48:41] <wassup> there should be just one pair of brackets
[03:48:50] <Nebros> ok, thanks :)
[03:49:02] <wassup> n/p
[03:49:12] <Cork> wassup: impressive that you managed to parse that :)
[03:49:56] <soee> Cork, $(document).on('ajaxComplete load', works for ajaxComplete but not for load
[03:50:33] <Cork> soee: try running it directly in your head
[03:51:06] <zarac> ravenzz: : ) thanks again
[03:51:08] <zarac> hea hea
[03:51:21] <wassup> Cork: years of experience :P
[03:51:28] <Nebros> well that you could help me, but why i was so stupid to not see this problem... -.-
[03:54:05] <wassup> btw. I thought I was on django :x
[04:01:34] <soee> Cork, should this work: $('body'.on('ajaxComplete', foo()); ?
[04:01:42] <Cork> no
[04:01:44] <soee> ) missing
[04:01:54] <Cork> $('body').on('ajaxComplete', foo);
[04:02:37] <soee> ah yes works fine, so i used named function as you suggested
[04:08:39] <noregret> I want to select 'td a' where 'a' doesn't have a data-toggle attrib, what kind of selector can i use here
[04:09:46] <wassup> all right, any good tutorials/materials/whatever to start the hourney with jquery?
[04:11:11] <noregret> or then agin, if I have $('td a') and $("a[data-toggle=popover]") selectors, where $("a[data-toggle=popover]") is also under a 'td', what will happend here? i tried it, and the 2nd anchor didn't get selected when clicking on other 'td a'
[04:11:56] <noregret> nevermind, it did get selected
[04:11:56] <Cork> noregret: $('td a').not('a[data-toggle]')
[04:12:02] <noregret> Cork: ah great!
[04:12:04] <noregret> thanks
[04:12:14] <noregret> always forget about .not
[04:12:22] <Cork> np
[04:12:38] <brianseeders> note that that doesn't work if you use $element.data('toggle', value) or similar
[04:12:46] <brianseeders> to set the value
[04:13:12] <Cork> but then you don't have data-toggle
[04:13:26] <brianseeders> that's what i mean
[04:14:09] <brianseeders> i've seen people set data with .data() then try to query on it with data-*
[04:34:08] <mongag> I'm using $.ajax function for ajax requests. The code that I use works fine on Chrome and FF but not on IE and Opera. In IE and Opera no data returned on ajax query. On IE I notice strange symbols in header.
[04:34:13] <mongag> What could be the problem?
[04:46:02] <Cork> ?p @ mongag
[04:46:03] <bot-t> mongag, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:47:21] <noregret> Cork: how can I do the same with $('.span8 .table').on('click', 'td a',  function(e){ ? i mean selecting 'td a' without 'a[data-toggle]' in this case
[04:48:03] <noregret> coz $('td a').not('a[data-toggle]') dno't work on dynamic content..
[04:48:40] <noregret> $('td a').not('a[data-toggle]').on() *
[04:56:44] <noregret> how can I select 'td a' without a[data-toggle] in $('.span8 .table').on('click', 'td a',  function(e){ ?
[04:59:31] <Cork> noregret: adding a class? :D
[04:59:58] <Cork> joke aside $('.span8 .table').on('click', 'td a:not([data-toggle])'
[05:00:24] <noregret> haha
[05:00:25] <noregret> thanks
[05:03:08] <chilversc_> is the old jquery tmpl documentation still hosted anywhere?
[05:04:35] <Cork> don't think so
[05:05:27] <chilversc_> damn, must be somewher
[05:06:15] <chilversc_> do wish you could easily browse older versions of the jquery documentation, same way you can with msdn
[05:06:52] <Cork> chilversc: http://jquery.github.com/jquery-tmpl/demos/step-by-step.html might help you
[05:07:19] <Cork> chilversc: that would depend on it actually existing anymore
[05:07:45] <chilversc_> Cork: well it existed in 1.4, so the idea would be you select to see the 1.4 docs and that's it
[05:08:29] <Cork> chilversc: jquery haven't ever had history on its docs
[05:08:37] <Cork> only the current version
[05:09:00] <Nebros> i have in ajax this http://jsfiddle.net/8KAKc/. when i use the first one, i have only "variable" available and when i use the second one, i have "variable2" (line 16/17 changed). why is that?
[05:09:26] <Nebros> ... i need both variables...
[05:10:16] <Nebros> MultiValueDictKeyError at /split/"Key 'variable' not found in <QueryDict: {u'variable2': [u'ch'], u'kundendaten': [u'1']}>
[05:10:33] <Cork> Nebros: whats the difference?
[05:10:45] <Nebros> line 16 / 17 changed
[05:10:55] <Cork> ah
[05:11:21] <Cork> loos like data('variable2') isn't a string
[05:11:32] <Nebros> hmm
[05:11:53] <chilversc_> Cork: yeah, just saying that's a shame
[05:12:13] <chilversc_> Cork: sometimes when looking at a project using an older version it would be nice to browse the docs for that version
[05:12:15] <Cork> chilversc: tmpl has been marked for removal for ages
[05:12:32] <chilversc_> Cork: yeah, this is an old project, tmpl was new back then :)
[05:13:58] <Cork> chilversc: might be time to upgrade the site
[05:14:01] <chilversc_> wow, the project is still using 1.4.4, heh
[05:19:08] <chilversc_> updating isn't trivial though, since you have to deal with all the deprecated/removed stuff, switch to using something like knockoutjs, test it works on all the browsers, etc
[05:19:16] <Nebros> Cork: variable = [u'SEF001105']   variable2 =  [u'ch']
[05:19:16] <chilversc_> and iirc, this site still has to support ie7
[05:19:55] <Cork> Nebros: is that variable = "[u'SEF001105']"   variable2 =  "[u'ch']" ?
[05:20:11] <Cork> chilversc: 1.9 supports ie7
[05:20:29] <Cork> chilversc: but ya i feel you, had BIG problems upgrading to 1.5 back when that happend
[05:20:42] <Nebros> i took the output from this error:
[05:20:43] <Nebros> MultiValueDictKeyError at /split/"Key 'variable' not found in <QueryDict: {u'variable2': [u'ch'], u'kundendaten': [u'1']}
[05:21:03] <Cork> Nebros: its QueryDict that i reacted to
[05:21:12] <Cork> seams what you have isn't a plain object
[05:21:16] <chilversc_> Cork: yeah, but we have to manually test all the pages still work, layout correctly, etc after making a change like that
[05:21:29] <Cork> chilversc: yup
[05:21:36] <chilversc_> Cork: for all the supported browsers, so that's about 6 browsers to test
[05:22:16] <Nebros> Cork: what means that for me?
[05:22:29] <chilversc_> though I have had the ok to finally stop supporting IE6 on all our sites, which is nice :)
[05:23:18] <Cork> Nebros: as i can't run the code, i'm only guessing here, but i think your getting some special type of object from our variable and params choke on it
[05:23:27] <Cork> Nebros: and thats where your problem is at
[05:23:38] <Nebros> hmm
[05:23:44] <Cork> chilversc: you could try data('')[0] if its just that its arrays
[05:23:58] <Cork> but, you would have to debug your data your self
[05:24:03] <Cork> as i can't access it
[05:25:38] <Nebros> Cork: ist this a bad idea:          <input type="hidden" name="variable2" value="{{ land }}">      thats my variable2   {{ land }} is django and give the output  ch
[05:26:07] <Cork> t  ch ?
[05:26:41] <Nebros> ch is not always the output, its a variable
[05:27:33] <Nebros> i think it have problem to load 2 variables
[05:27:52] <Nebros> always only one is listed
[05:28:28] <masentinel900> Good morning guys!!
[05:28:37] <Nebros> masentinel900: hi
[05:28:55] <masentinel900> Someone know where Can I to find hidden rows with datatables plugin?
[05:30:56] <BillyJoe_> In jquery-mobile, how should I do to manually hide/show pages (instead of using jQuery.mobile.changePage() that BOTH hides and shows)? The purpose is that I need to fetch some data using ajax and then show the next page.
[05:37:44] <granden> Hi, I'm looking around for some nice drag 'n drop alike jquery plugin for uploading a file in a form. But I dont want any ajax upload of the file but rather the normal upload so nothing is being uploaded before I have processed the form etc as usual. So would more be just a convientent way for the end user to select file. Is there any plugin like that?
[05:40:30] <mazzachre> I have a problem with IE8, I have some divs in z-index layers, and I have a hover handler on the front most element. In FF, Chrome and IE9 and 10 it works as expected, but in IE8 the handler is not run when the mouse is over a part of the top most block when a block underneath have text on it! I can't figure out why, except it might have something to do with opacity?
[05:41:08] <Cork> mazzachre: have you tried giving it zoom: 1; ?
[05:41:20] <mazzachre> Uhm no... where?
[05:41:30] <Cork> css rule to give it hasLayout
[05:41:31] <johanhar> Hi. Can someone help me with this selector? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5186903
[05:41:51] <johanhar> I get two results with that selector, the ones that are listed
[05:42:23] <Cork> johanhar: you should NEVER select an element based on a child
[05:42:32] <mazzachre> Cork, uhm... I don't quite follow...
[05:42:33] <Cork> and :has doens't do that
[05:42:38] <johanhar> Cork: thanks
[05:42:46] <johanhar> Do you have a suggestion to a better way of doing it?
[05:42:52] <Cork> mazzachre: have you heared of ie hasLayout?
[05:42:55] <johanhar> I'm kind of stuck
[05:43:12] <Cork> johanhar: set the class on the thumbing and possible a static class on the target for the empty
[05:43:15] <mazzachre> Cork: Well, I vaguely remember something :p
[05:43:50] <Cork> mazzachre: basically things bug out sometimes cause you need hasLayout on the element
[05:43:57] <Cork> setting zoom: 1; does that
[05:44:12] <Cork> so test setting it on the element that "leaks" and see if that helps
[05:44:30] <Cork> it doesn't always do, but quite often
[05:44:53] <johanhar> Cork: it's a selector that I want to use in "accept" for jquery-ui.droppable. Not sure how the selector should be then, it should not accept thumbimg with the class "empty"
[05:45:09] <mazzachre> What element to set zoom: 1; on? The element that fails to trigger the hover events?
[05:45:32] <Cork> johanhar: .thumbimg:not(.empty)
[05:45:42] <Cork> mazzachre: yes
[05:46:06] <johanhar> Cork: thanks
[05:46:07] <Cork> mazzachre: also remember that z-index is broken in older versions ofie
[05:46:10] <Cork> *of ie
[05:46:46] <Cork> mazzachre: so basically you need a global z-index numbering in older ie's
[05:47:03] <Cork> cause they don't sum with the parent
[05:48:34] <mazzachre> Cork: Oh... I will check that...
[05:48:44] <mazzachre> The zoom: 1; on my helper did nothing...
[05:50:07] <mazzachre> Cork: OK, I can see it is to do with background: transparent; When I remove that, it works as expected (but then I can't see the element below that should be displayed...
[05:50:23] <Cork> ah
[05:50:48] <Cork> mazzachre: thats an ie 'feature' transparent areas can't capture click :)
[05:50:59] <Cork> they let them through
[05:51:13] <Cork> set opacity: .1; or something similar
[05:51:14] <mazzachre> It is not a click, but a mouseover
[05:51:20] <Cork> same thing
[05:54:03] <mazzachre> Cork: Thx... that worked... except IE8 does not have opcatiry, but it does have a ms-filter thingie... and I just set that to 1 (0.01 in std) and background to white... Then it worses... thx!
[05:54:22] <Cork> mazzachre: got to love ie...
[05:56:08] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya... is that general for all IE? Or have they fixed this in 9 or 10?
[05:56:27] <mazzachre> Cork: And I love IE... it gives me extra hours..
[05:57:02] <djj_> Is it possible to extend the jquery-ui selectable grid by making it so that when you select a number of boxes a jquery-ui dialog appears?
[05:57:34] <djj_> Basically saying upon highlighting your boxes can you make a dialog appear?
[05:58:19] <Cork> mazzachre: its added to prevent click hijacking, and to fix pages that extend large transparent areas and want the links to work that lies behind
[05:58:31] <Cork> mazzachre: ie9 or 10 might have removed it, not sure
[05:59:22] <Cork> djj_: you can extend jquery ui to do most anything, how much you would have to code to do it is another matter
[05:59:47] <mazzachre> Cork: Hmmm ok... Well, setting opacity to 0.01 does not look different, and works, so some fix :p Anyway, thx!
[05:59:51] <seutje> wait what?
[05:59:52] <djj_> Cork: Thanks that's all i wanted to know cheers
[06:00:03] <seutje> u can emulate pointer-events by applying opacity? o.O
[06:00:28] <Cork> seutje: no you can capture it in the overlay
[06:00:43] <seutje> oh the other way around
[06:00:43] <Cork> ie "removes" transparent parts in an overlay
[06:00:44] <seutje> damnit
[06:01:24] <tiennou> hi ! I'm having a problem doing a "flash" effect using this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/275931/how-do-you-make-an-element-flash-in-jquery#1145719
[06:01:40] <seutje> I'm just pissed I still can't style select elements properly thanks to IE9's lack of pointer-events
[06:01:51] <seutje> granted, it's not a real spec, but it so useful :(
[06:02:31] <Cork> seutje: i'm REALLY annoyed that the specs still nag on about "native look" as soon as you touch form elements
[06:02:38] <Cork> as a default theme; sure
[06:02:52] <seutje> yeah
[06:02:53] <Cork> but just let it be normal dom elements like anything else...
[06:03:04] <seutje> appearance: fuck-off;
[06:03:10] <seutje> if only that was specced
[06:03:12] <Cork> heh
[06:03:20] <Cork> like the styling of checkboxes
[06:03:30] <Cork> or the dropdown arrow in a selectbox
[06:03:34] <Cork> *sigh*
[06:03:35] <seutje> yeah
[06:03:44] <Cork> or... PADDING!!!===!=!=!=!= TT_TT
[06:03:45] <seutje> well, u can get rid of it with appearance on ff an webkit
[06:04:03] <seutje> my favorite is line-height on text input on FF
[06:04:15] <Cork> select { padding: 15px; } * blink* *WTF!*
[06:04:21] <seutje> they prolly fixed it by now, but back in the 3.5 and before days, there was no way to override it
[06:04:29] <seutje> the UA style used !important
[06:04:38] <seutje> couldn't even override it using inline style attribute
[06:04:50] <Cork> well thats important for you
[06:05:20] <seutje> !super-crucial;
[06:05:22] <Cork> what annoyes me most is that firefox used to handle padding sainly on select elements
[06:05:37] <Cork> and then they moved to using the same broken style as webkit :/
[06:05:54] <Cork> lets put the padding around the dropdown button and text area >_>
[06:06:05] <Cork> "no don't!"
[06:06:08] <Cork> *sigh*
[06:06:27] <seutje> yup, FF still doesn't allow u to override line-height of a textfield, it seems
[06:06:35] <Cork> even what ie does is better ignore it
[06:06:45] <tiennou> (sry, got distracted)
[06:06:50] <tiennou> the problem i have is that animate({backgroundColor: originalBg}, animateMs) use the calculated background color instead of the default value
[06:07:27] <Cork> tiennou: if you've ever set a color on the element, that is what will be the color
[06:08:14] <tiennou> I'm setting a color through css, but I don't want that color to end up in the "style" attribute (which it does atm)
[06:08:29] <Cork> how else would the color style the element?
[06:08:56] <tiennou> okay, that's a little more complicated ;-)
[06:09:25] <Cork> tiennou: so set a color on an element through js you set it on the style attribute
[06:09:37] <Cork> tiennou: when you want it to "revert" you have to remove it
[06:09:59] <tiennou> i got cells in a table where users can click on them to set their "reservation" state, so that 2 colors (reserved/unreserved)
[06:10:07] <Cork> css('background-color', '')
[06:10:38] <tiennou> additionally, if you try to click a cell while there's a conflicting reservation state, i do the flash effect on both cells
[06:11:09] <tiennou> the problem is that the flash effect messes up the reserved/unreserved color
[06:11:44] <tiennou> Cork: i tried that in the animate() call, but it ended as white
[06:12:12] <Cork> hmm
[06:12:18] <Cork> removeAttr('style') ?
[06:12:25] <Cork> (a bit hard handed i know)
[06:12:39] <seutje> u can't animate to default value without specifying said value iirc
[06:13:13] <Cork> i think you can animate from what a class have set
[06:13:23] <Cork> or that might be jquery-ui doing that
[06:13:31] <seutje> oh right, with the new things, u can even animate classes
[06:13:43] <seutje> could be ui though, dunno
[06:14:04] <tiennou> removeAttr doesn't work (chained after the animate() call)
[06:14:12] <Cork> after?
[06:14:14] <Cork> no before
[06:14:24] <seutje> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/ClassTransitions ?
[06:14:38] <Cork> thats prob the better option ya
[06:14:39] <masentinel900> Guys Someone has  worked with datatables plugin?
[06:14:48] <Cork> i'm actually not sure why thats not in core
[06:15:02] <seutje> I've never needed it
[06:15:14] <Cork> css should really move into the css files, and not hang around in the js file
[06:15:17] <seutje> if I need to transition classes, I put it in the CSS
[06:15:35] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[06:15:39] <tiennou> same...
[06:15:58] <seutje> then again, I have full control over the entire project, usually
[06:16:00] <Cork> seutje: mainly from befoer transition existed
[06:16:17] <seutje> yeah prolly
[06:16:25] <Germanaz0> hello everybody, I was using the module livequery, but now is kinda obsolete
[06:16:32] <seutje> it sure is
[06:16:32] <Cork> and transition haven't existed that long :)
[06:16:38] <seutje> and they still suck
[06:16:38] <tiennou> the color sticks when I transition reserved => unreserved (since the originalBg reserved color was set)
[06:16:41] <seutje> go ahead, say it :P
[06:16:43] <tiennou> I'll try to clear it at some other convenient time...
[06:16:57] <masentinel900> DataTables hidden row details :: This more exactly!!
[06:17:03] <Cork> Germanaz0: to answer your question before you ask it, use delegate
[06:17:16] <Cork> Germanaz0: see ?.on and see ?.delegate
[06:17:19] <bot-t> Germanaz0, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:17:19] <bot-t> Germanaz0, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:17:32] <Germanaz0> Cork I know, but what happens for events that are related to the document body
[06:17:36] <Germanaz0> kinda in general
[06:17:52] <Cork> Germanaz0: what do you mean?
[06:18:13] <Germanaz0> on live query I could use for example, $('document').livequery()
[06:18:33] <Cork> i doubt you could do $('document')
[06:18:33] <Germanaz0> but nvm, delegate sounds cool
[06:18:48] <seutje> Germanaz0: just don't specify a selector for .on
[06:18:53] <Cork> but $(document) should work just the same with delegate and on (on has a delegate syntax)
[06:19:27] <Germanaz0> ok thnx :D
[06:22:11] <tiennou> okay, got it to work using animate({complete: })
[06:22:41] <tiennou> is there something less heavy-handed than removeAttr that can be used to remove css ?
[06:22:52] <tiennou> decss() ? ;-p
[06:23:14] <xckpd7> removeClass()?
[06:23:28] <dingdong_> what is jquery?
[06:23:37] <anew> !jquery
[06:23:45] <anew> y u no jquery !
[06:23:45] <b-ot> anew: (屮'Д')屮
[06:23:52] <dingdong_> how to use jquery?
[06:24:02] <dingdong_> the same with javascript?
[06:24:05] <anew> dingdong you want to jquery in your jquery so you can jquery
[06:24:28] <dingdong_> ?
[06:24:31] <dingdong_> what ?
[06:24:39] <dingdong_> what is mean?
[06:24:53] <tiennou> i mean remove stuff added by css() in a style attribute without killing it entirely
[06:26:02] <dingdong_> i do not konw
[06:27:33] <dingdong_> can you tail me in detail
[06:30:11] <adavia> can anybody tell me what might be failing here http://jsfiddle.net/GBVKL/3/
[06:32:02] <pachet> adavia: you had a syntax error
[06:32:03] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/N7hjD/
[06:32:38] <adavia> pachet:  there u go.. thanks!
[06:33:35] <Germanaz0> I need help, replacing a livequery with delegate or ON method
[06:33:58] <pachet> hint: use .on
[06:34:03] <Germanaz0> I used livequery, to load for example, a date picker after ajax was loaded
[06:34:23] <Germanaz0> how to load date picker, after ajax content is loaded
[06:34:32] <Germanaz0> with ON or delegate
[06:34:45] <Cork> Germanaz0: no need to use either
[06:34:58] <Cork> $(document).on('onComplete', function() {}
[06:35:09] <Cork> Germanaz0: or use callbacks on the ajax call
[06:35:28] <pachet> definitely the most performant to selectively target the elements when you know they exist
[06:35:32] <Germanaz0> :D
[06:35:34] <pachet> as Cork said, use the ajax callback
[06:35:36] <Germanaz0> that is cool
[06:35:40] <Germanaz0> onComplete
[06:36:06] <Germanaz0> thnx, gonna try it
[06:36:45] <Cork> Germanaz0: with the dom event path you won't know what ajax response will trigger it though
[06:37:06] <Cork> so, ya i would recommend using callbacks, as you then KNOW the context of your response
[06:37:11] <Germanaz0> there is an event after dom element is added ?
[06:37:17] <Cork> no
[06:37:26] <Cork> not cross browser at least
[06:37:26] <Germanaz0> oh
[06:37:30] <pachet> there are, but they're not very well supported and they're awful
[06:37:34] <anew> dingdong_ jquery makes javascript easier
[06:37:55] <Germanaz0> Cork, thnx then
[06:37:56] <Germanaz0> :D
[06:37:59] <Germanaz0> it helped me
[06:38:13] <Cork> pachet: mutation observers is quite nice actually
[06:38:43] <Cork> lack of support (yet) is a hamper though
[06:39:01] <pachet> in my experience they're about as performant as an orangutan conducting a symphony
[06:39:22] <Cork> pachet: are you sure your talking about the observers and not events?
[06:39:22] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/jtrBb/
[06:39:51] <Cork> pachet: the observers is a new replacement of the mutation events, and they don't have the same speed proboem
[06:39:56] <Cork> *problem
[06:40:24] <masentinel900> Guys of that way, How is possible how is possible to set a name caption and width style for that dynamic row?
[06:40:28] <pachet> Cork: yeah we're talking about the same thing
[06:40:34] <pachet> granted i havent messed with them in a bit
[06:41:00] <pachet> but in whatever version of ff i was using they seemed rather slow
[06:41:31] <pachet> that was probably june of last year or so, though
[06:42:34] <pachet> Cork: also when you mentioned .on('onComplete', fn) did you mean .on('ajaxComplete', fn)?
[06:42:43] <Cork> ah... yes
[06:42:48] <Cork> sorry, never use it my self
[06:42:55] <pachet> heh, yeah me neither
[06:43:39] <Cork> masentinel900: uh... why are you asking pure js questions in jquery?
[06:43:49] <seutje> .on('on', function() { /* AAAAAAAW YEAAAAAA */ });
[06:43:54] <seutje> sry
[06:43:56] <Cork> masentinel900: and yes, just add the attributes in the string
[06:54:45] <chase-work> Can anyone tell me why this results in an uncaught syntax error?
[06:54:47] <chase-work> eval('<a href="https//domain.com/path/vis?app=myApp&id=uniqu.uq.id&indx=uniqueindex"  popup="true" title="view elsewhere">uniqu.uq.id</a>');
[06:55:03] <Cork> uh...
[06:55:09] <Cork> your evaling html?!?
[06:55:17] <Cork> how on earth would that work?
[06:55:28] <chase-work> haha
[06:55:48] <Cork> html belongs in the dom,
[06:55:55] <chase-work> its nasty
[06:55:56] <Cork> not in the js parser
[06:56:07] <pachet> what's nasty
[06:56:18] <chase-work> what i'm trying to do. i'm accessing data aliment of a slickgrid row
[06:56:37] <Cork> chase-work: your feeding html to the js parser
[06:56:44] <Cork> that won't ever work; period
[06:56:48] <chase-work> hmm
[06:56:57] <chase-work> for some reason i thought i'd done it before
[06:57:00] <chase-work> i must be off my meds
[06:57:32] <Cork> chase-work: what is it you're trying to do?
[06:59:07] <chase-work> export some rows by id from a slick grid table
[06:59:28] <chase-work> the js gets the selected rows, via grid.getSelectedRows()
[06:59:43] <chase-work> that gives the rowIds
[07:00:14] <chase-work> then getDataItem(n), n being the rowId
[07:00:53] <chase-work> getDataItem(n).unique_id returns the <a href…></a>
[07:01:00] <chase-work> as a string
[07:01:11] <chase-work> and I want the text() of the href
[07:01:22] <chase-work> hence the attempt at an eval
[07:01:29] <pachet> :[
[07:02:40] <chase-work> mhmm
[07:03:40] <Cork> chase-work: that sounds quite broken
[07:03:47] <chase-work> oh i agree
[07:03:59] <Cork> if nothing else the fact that you get the html as an "uniq_id" ?!?
[07:04:03] <chase-work> i'm just trying to work with what i have, which is little in the know-how of slick grid
[07:04:30] <Cork> check what else you can grab from getDataItem
[07:04:30] <chase-work> yea
[07:04:31] <chase-work> its weird
[07:06:34] <chase-work> a lot of elements
[07:06:43] <chase-work> i'm going to look at the slick grid api real quick
[07:15:29] <chase-work> ok i think i learned a little more about slick grid and may have fixed the problem.
[07:15:39] <chase-work> thanks for sticking with it Cork!
[07:31:41] <ladislaw> is this a valid jquery variable?  $node
[07:31:57] <pachet> what do you mean by valid
[07:31:59] <aMoniker> ladislaw: that's a valid javascript variable
[07:32:02] <pachet> it's a valid javasc----
[07:32:13] <ladislaw> ok
[07:32:20] <Cork> ladislaw: yes it is, its just $ is valid in a variable name
[07:33:06] <pachet> ladislaw: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-7.6
[07:33:15] <ladislaw> I seen in a tutorial for a js framework where they use $node to refer to a particlar node e.g #foo
[07:33:45] <Cork> ladislaw: many tutorials like using $ in the name to mark them "special"
[07:34:04] <ladislaw> let me get you a pastebin
[07:36:51] <ladislaw> can somebody explain why? http://pastebin.com/Sj1yaXps
[07:37:11] <ladislaw> i'm still getting used to js
[07:38:07] <Cork> ladislaw: $node is a variable on the current object your working in
[07:38:15] <Cork> thats why you have this.$node
[07:38:52] <Cork> so you need to have the object you're referring to in the first section
[07:39:17] <ladislaw> why does it work for fist?
[07:39:18] <Germanaz0> could backbone replace live query ?
[07:39:20] <ladislaw> first(
[07:39:22] <ladislaw> first*
[07:39:41] <Cork> ladislaw: for first?
[07:39:47] <Cork> in the first section?
[07:39:51] <ladislaw> yes
[07:39:53] <chinoto> want clarification: Inside an event handler, "this" always refers to the selected element, or if provided, a descendant element that matches the selector given to ,on()?
[07:40:04] <ladislaw> line 3-8
[07:40:12] <Cork> cause you're working on an object that has the $node added to it
[07:40:30] <Gho5t> you're not even accessing $node in the same way in the 2nd function
[07:40:37] <ladislaw> where? what line is the $node add?
[07:41:01] <ladislaw> added*
[07:41:02] <Cork> ladislaw: there is nothing magical about that variable, if you don't create it it doesn't exist
[07:41:07] <Cork> so something is creating it
[07:41:19] <ladislaw> right!
[07:41:19] <Cork> ladislaw: somewhere outsite your pb
[07:41:25] <Gho5t> line 4 vs line 14
[07:41:29] <Cork> no
[07:41:32] <Gho5t> this.$node vs $node
[07:41:41] <Cork> Gho5t: its not the same at all most likely
[07:41:47] <ladislaw> if I remove "this" I still get undefined msg
[07:41:58] <Cork> ladislaw: the basic point is that there is too little context to tell
[07:42:03] <Gho5t> yeap
[07:42:14] <ladislaw> Cork: your right
[07:42:23] <ladislaw> must be a framework thing
[07:43:03] <ladislaw> so i'm clear the var "$node" is not a resevred word in js or jq?
[07:43:04] <Gho5t> it would be easy enough to make $node exist above those functions and share it between them
[07:43:16] <Cork> ladislaw: nope
[07:43:31] <ladislaw> yes, definantly a framework thing
[07:43:31] <Cork> ladislaw: actually there is no reserved words in jq
[07:43:32] <ladislaw> thanks
[07:43:39] <Cork> except for the basic js ones
[07:43:39] <ladislaw> ok
[07:43:51] <Cork> you can replace them all if you like :)
[07:44:00] <Cork> (and many do)
[07:46:23] <chinoto> ladislaw: properly indent your code >.< http://pastebin.com/QmEHQe3y
[07:49:27] <masentinel900> Guys someone could  tell me how can I pass data from my php controller to that function?  ::  http://jsfiddle.net/5HLtB/
[07:51:00] <Cork> masentinel900: pass data?
[07:51:27] <Cork> you have two options 1. set the date from php when the page loads, or do an ajax call from the page requesting the data
[07:51:46] <masentinel900> Cork: Yes
[07:51:58] <masentinel900> Data from SQL Database
[07:51:58] <Cork> yes what?
[07:52:22] <Cork> what you have on the server end doesn't really matter
[07:52:30] <Cork> you have to get it to the page
[07:53:31] <masentinel900> See that
[07:53:38] <masentinel900> http://pastebin.com/ZaAcsjVE
[07:59:16] <Cork> ya?
[07:59:47] <masentinel900> <Cork>: do you understand me?
[07:59:52] <Cork> no
[08:00:22] <Cork> if you have data in php that you want access to in the page, you need to send it in a stream to the page
[08:00:30] <Cork> either on full page load, or through ajax
[08:09:03] <metalx2000> I started redoing my site yesterday.  I'm trying to use JQuery more.  I'm having an issue.  If you go to my site and scroll down to the video thumbnails, you can click on one and it will bring that video up.  but, if you use the search bar I created, you can no longer click on the thumbnails to get the video http://filmsbykris.com/v6
[08:09:59] <Cork> metalx2000: just guessing, but i suspect your binding your event listener on the element, and when its searched the elements are replaced
[08:10:12] <Cork> metalx2000: you should have a look at delegated event listener
[08:10:17] <Cork> ?.on
[08:10:19] <bot-t> Cork, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:10:34] <metalx2000> I'll look now, thanks cork
[08:15:55] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you have a second?
[08:16:37] <metalx2000> Cork, That was it, thanks a bunch  :)
[08:30:40] <ladislaw> click is not seem to be firing ... is this correct? this.on(document, "click", this.toggle);
[08:30:57] <chinoto> nope
[08:31:05] <ladislaw> go on
[08:31:08] <chinoto> what is "this"
[08:31:25] <ladislaw> thats a framework thing ... think of it  ]as a node
[08:31:29] <ladislaw> #foo
[08:31:43] <chinoto> k, just remove document and it should work
[08:32:15] <toxz> does it make any sense to call a function like this: http://jsfiddle.net/QNS8H/ ?
[08:32:30] <chinoto> ladislaw: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:32:38] <chinoto> always check the api ;)
[08:32:55] <chinoto> toxz: why not?
[08:33:25] <chinoto> if your intent is to call it on dom ready, then that is the best way
[08:33:53] <toxz> chinoto - i only know $(document).ready(...)
[08:34:05] <toxz> but not $(function() {...}) !?
[08:34:21] <chinoto> $(function(){,,,}) is a shortcut for $(document).ready(...)
[08:34:37] <toxz> i found this in a script here btw and was wondering if it makes any sense
[08:34:49] <toxz> is it?
[08:34:53] <chinoto> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery3
[08:35:10] <hlve> toxz, what'd you find?
[08:35:27] <toxz> ah ok - so it's ok
[08:35:32] <toxz> nice thx
[08:40:30] <pallet> Hi people, can you guys watch this movie and tell me your thoughts please, http://www.wedoyourtweets.com/landing/ ;)
[08:40:53] <nathanbl> hey
[08:41:06] <nathanbl> when i update a value of a text field will the event 'change' be triggered ?
[08:41:17] <nathanbl> as it doesn't seem to be :)
[08:42:22] <pachet> nope
[08:42:32] <pachet> $('input').val('foo').trigger('change')
[08:42:42] <pachet> ^ you have to trigger the event programmatically
[08:42:56] <chinoto> nathanbl: "change" is implemented differently by browsers, but I believe the general way is to fire it if the content has changed when the input is blurred

[08:56:42] <jeffsmykil> anyone have any experience with any wordpress hosts?
[08:56:47] <CarieFisher> Clex: That does not work with each. Thanks anyhow.
[08:57:05] <CarieFisher> jeffsmykill: Sounds like a question for the wordpress channel.
[08:57:13] <jeffsmykil> lol
[08:57:23] <jeffsmykil> but these people are more knowledgeable
[08:59:21] <didiergm> jqm 1.3.0 I call a popup after a click event on a button and when the task is finished, I display a popup. On mobile chrome (IOS or Android) the popup closes immediately (no opportunity to read) on desktop Chrome & firefox the popup stays until the user clicks anywhere on the page to dismiss the popup. Any idea would bne welcomed.

[09:09:22] <t4nk908> given an element, can I find out how high up is a certain ancestor?

[09:12:25] <t4nk908> does closest() check siblings of the initial context element?
[09:14:31] <slash_nick> t4nk908: the docs say it traverses up through the ancestors... and siblings aren't ancestors
[09:15:07] <Err404NotFound> Is there a way i can blacklist some code to not run on ajax?
[09:15:44] <sacho> "to not run on ajax"?
[09:17:59] <Err404NotFound> sacho: I call JQuery.globalEval on the returned JS of an ajax request. Couple of lines in that JS code (like one that calls .buttonset) gives errors.
[09:18:40] <nathanbl> yeah thx for the heal guys
[09:19:39] <ladislaw> i have toggle() hooked up to the node "#cb-add-media" in line 2....when clicked it hide the node "#upload-icon" line 22, it should it avoid this node.
[09:19:45] <sacho> you can't, really
[09:19:55] <maxmoore14> I'm building my first REST api. Got it working in a browser. I can enter https://localhost:44300/restservice.svc/users/1 and get a valid json response. But when I try to call it via ajax with jquery, I get a blank error.
[09:20:10] <maxmoore14> anybody have a thought? Not sure how to debug this.
[09:20:12] <sacho> I suppose something you could do(albeit rather elaborate), would be to parse the code, then remove the offending parts, then eval it
[09:20:22] <NoiseEee> maxmoore14: probably breaking SOP and need to specify JSONP ?
[09:20:23] <sacho> (you'd need a js parser and a way to manipulate its contents etc)
[09:20:30] <sacho> or you could do text matching if it's fairly static
[09:20:54] <maxmoore14> NoiseEee: what's SOP?
[09:21:07] <NoiseEee> maxmoore14: same origin policy
[09:21:29] <ladislaw> anyone?
[09:21:29] <maxmoore14> oh, yes - it would be cross domain, right?
[09:22:11] <NoiseEee> maxmoore14: yes, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6396623/jquery-getjson-access-control-allow-origin-issue
[09:22:14] <Err404NotFound> Is there opposite of buttonset()? Like for event handlers i call unbind().bind() (along with namespaces) which makes sure that same events handlers are not re-registered.
[09:22:42] <maxmoore14> NoiseEee: thanks. I'll take a look now.
[09:23:56] <Err404NotFound> destroy() would do it..
[09:30:45] <maxmoore14> NoiseEee: since I am building both the rest api & the client, I can adapt as needed. Are subdomains allowed or would that still be considered cross domain? what if I configure my api at https://rest.domain.com/ and my client site at http://domain.com/
[09:31:13] <maxmoore14> does the transport matter also?
[09:31:28] <NoiseEee> maxmoore14: all of it matters https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[09:33:27] <maxmoore14> NoiseEee: ok. my issue is, I don't think I want to use jsonp. so theoretically I could maybe serve both from https://domain.com/
[09:34:19] <NoiseEee> maxmoore14: just specifying jsonp in your jquery ajax request should make things work as you intended maxmoore14
[09:34:46] <maxmoore14> ok, I'll try it out. thanks for your help.
[09:35:10] <ladislaw> can you explicitly pass param to toggle() to exclude a specific node?
[09:35:17] <logikos> can someone please explain to me why this doesnt seem to work? http://jsfiddle.net/SxLSz/
[09:35:18] <NoiseEee> ladislaw: no
[09:35:26] <logikos> expected output is -1, 1, -1, -1
[09:35:50] <johnathanb> logikos That's what I'm getting.
[09:35:54] <logikos> i did discover that if i use this.toString() in place of this it works
[09:37:10] <NoiseEee> logikos: maybe this helps explain it http://jsfiddle.net/SxLSz/2/
[09:37:11] <logikos> johnathanb: you see that its useing inArray(this,["... and you see 1 not -1 for the 2nd value ?
[09:37:42] <johnathanb> Nope, getting -1 for all four
[09:37:54] <logikos> NoiseEee: yes, it does
[09:38:23] <logikos> NoiseEee: is useing this.toString() the proper solution to the problem? or is there some other alternative
[09:40:21] <NoiseEee> logikos: i don't think you can use an array to see if its in an array?
[09:40:28] <NoiseEee> oh sorry i misread
[09:41:21] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/SxLSz/3/ @ logikos
[09:42:56] <NoiseEee> $.each parameters are array position, element respectively @ logikos
[09:43:28] <logikos> ty, very helpful, now i better understand what this thing is doing
[09:43:31] <logikos> thanks for your time
[09:43:34] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[09:48:08] <abes> Question: for mouseleave() is it possible to have a single function applied to two different (though adjacent) elements, so that if I move from one div to another the mouseleave event won't be triggered?
[09:51:09] <Almindor> hey
[09:51:24] <Almindor> anyone knows how can you set the size of an "add row" dialog/form with datatables?
[09:51:33] <Teduardo> isn't google's recaptcha supposed to prevent form submission if they leave the field blank?
[09:51:34] <Almindor> it seems it's generated in a div with width=300px all the time
[09:51:42] <Teduardo> that seems kind of pointless otherwise
[09:53:23] <jombalomba> How do you configure jquery so that you can write '$this' instead of having to write '$(this)' ?
[09:53:35] <NoiseEee> jombalomba: you dont
[09:53:50] <NoiseEee> $ is a function reference.
[09:53:52] <xckpd7> jombalomba: var $this = $(this)?
[09:54:21] <jombalomba> NoiseEe: is that considered horrible or what?
[09:54:40] <Croves> Why I keep getting this error? "TypeError: $ is not a function"
[09:54:56] <Croves> I'm using jQuery 1.8.3 provided by Google APIs
[09:55:18] <NoiseEee> jombalomba: what xckpd7 provided is certainly valid, i thought you just wanted magic
[09:55:47] <Clex> Croves: likely because you didn't properly included jQuery.
[09:56:05] <Croves> Clex: I have this: <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
[09:56:37] <jombalomba> Croves: Either jquery is not properly loaded or you have another library that is also using the $ variable, which can cause conflicts
[09:56:46] <Clex> Croves: are you loading your own script before jQuery?
[09:57:00] <Err404NotFound> Is there a way i could get a query string parameter from current request uri, not the window.location?
[09:57:10] <Croves> jombalomba: I bough a theme from wrapbootstrap, and it have a lot of plugins
[09:57:17] <Croves> Clex: No, it's above all JS files
[09:58:38] <gotwig> hey there
[09:58:46] <gotwig> I am using jQuery UI resizeable
[09:58:56] <gotwig> newly created DOM elements don't work with resize
[09:59:00] <gotwig> but only older ones
[09:59:04] <gotwig> why is that?
[09:59:16] <Croves> Clex, jombalomba this is my footer: http://pastebin.com/ciqZYaMa
[09:59:30] <jombalomba> Croves : you can check if jquery is loaded at the start of your script 'if (typeof jQuery == 'undefined') alert("Jquery not loaded"); } '
[10:00:06] <gotwig> how can I say that new created elements should be resizeable as well?
[10:00:34] <Croves> jombalomba: It seems it's loaded, because It doesn't show me any message
[10:01:07] <Zzaichik> newly created as in after the dom has loaded?
[10:01:21] <pachet> gotwig: that's because to make something resizable, you call that ui method on a collection of dom elements
[10:01:30] <pachet> which necessarily doesnt create anything that hasnt been created yet :[
[10:01:37] <gotwig> pachet: and when I add a new one
[10:01:44] <gotwig> pachet: I have to give the property again?
[10:02:03] <pachet> when you create a new one, just call $(newOne).foo() or whatever you want
[10:02:11] <pachet> but you have to do it explicitly for those new elements
[10:02:21] <gotwig> :(
[10:02:26] <gotwig> that is garbage code..
[10:02:29] <jombalomba> Croves: try removing all other script links except for jquery
[10:02:43] <jombalomba> Croves: ..just to make sure that none of the plugins are screwing up the $ variable
[10:02:46] <pachet> jquery isnt going to say 'hey, this looks kind of like that element he called that method on earlier. lets just assume he wants that method called here, too'
[10:02:59] <gotwig> pachet: can't I use something dynamic?
[10:03:04] <Croves> good idea, jombalomba. I'll try it
[10:03:18] <pachet> gotwig: sure, write something dynamic
[10:03:24] <pachet> some abstraction layer that does all that work for you
[10:03:26] <pachet> its what i do
[10:03:30] <pachet> but jquery doesnt do it for you out of the box
[10:04:10] <gotwig> pachet: can I use an event listener or what
[10:04:16] <gotwig> pachet: or use .on
[10:04:49] <jombalomba> Croves: it's not very common but it is possible that other libs overload the $ variable in weird ways. But most likely it's a way simpler problem than that. Well, good luck. gotta go now
[10:04:59] <Croves> jombalomba: I belive you're right. I did what you said, and it worked
[10:05:44] <gotwig> pachet: wanna take a look at my code?
[10:06:24] <nebmo> why wont rdata_id value go into the field name 'rdata_id'? -> var submittedForm = $(this).parents("form"); $(submittedForm).find("name['rdata_id']").val(html.rdata_id); <-
[10:06:59] <nebmo> (rdata_id is the name and its also a hidden field)
[10:07:16] <NoiseEee> nebmo: whats "html" referencing?
[10:07:18] <troop> hello
[10:07:40] <nebmo> NoiseEee: html.rdata_id is the value (returns from a json post)
[10:07:54] <NoiseEee> nebmo: still in scope / available?
[10:08:15] <nebmo> yeh, i did an alert(html.rdata_id) to make sure.
[10:08:21] <gotwig> pachet: http://pastebin.com/ZPGHZipv
[10:08:37] <NoiseEee> nebmo: well perhaps submitttedForm isn't a form, or doesn't have an element with that name.
[10:08:47] <NoiseEee> nebmo: because otherwise the code you pasted looks kosher
[10:09:11] <nebmo> I'll check again :)
[10:09:18] <pachet> gotwig: there's too much there, narrow it down to your specific use case
[10:09:33] <pachet> but basically, wherever you have an .ajax result adding .gs_w elements, bind the new ones there
[10:09:35] <spaceace85> Hi all
[10:09:50] <pachet> $('.gs_w', newContent).resizable(parameters);
[10:09:51] <troop> http://pastebin.com/xiyB8q1b this code copied selectbox and print in screen ... isnt it weird? i just want to print post data????
[10:10:05] <gotwig> pachet: line 130
[10:10:15] <gotwig> pachet: what has this to do with ajax lol?
[10:11:07] <troop> missing the line.. url: 'ilceid'+ilceid,  but still same
[10:11:30] <gotwig> pachet: can't I just put that whole .resizeable thing into a function, and then reExecute it?
[10:11:43] <spaceace85> I've got a large amount of data to fill a selectbox - rougly 400kb.. rather than download this every time it's needed on different pages, is there a way to download it once and store it locally?
[10:12:26] <pachet> gotwig: sure, but then you have to be sure that .resizable checks to make sure it hasnt already been initialized on specific results from that selector
[10:12:32] <pachet> most $.ui conformant plugins do
[10:12:34] <pachet> but some dont
[10:12:40] <pachet> er, i guess that should read
[10:12:47] <pachet> if a $.ui plugin is conformant to spec, it will
[10:12:49] <pachet> but not all are
[10:13:06] * gotwig is not very clever
[10:13:19] <pachet> gotwig: seriously, just store those parameters somewhere
[10:13:34] <pachet> then manually recall $.resizable for your new elements, and pass in those parameters again
[10:13:47] <gotwig> pachet: global variable?..
[10:13:50] <pachet> if you want to abstract away that behavior, fine, but that's the basic strategy
[10:14:06] <pachet> global variables are bad, so no
[10:14:16] <pachet> s/bad/misunderstood
[10:14:45] <hooloovoo> global variables can be awesome if you use them right.
[10:15:25] <hooloovoo> well... maybe not awesome, but not as dirty as people make them seem
[10:15:36] <gotwig> pachet: or I can just use redunant code
[10:16:19] <pachet> gotwig: i recommend not
[10:16:33] <pachet> then if you have to make a change you have to remember to change both places
[10:16:44] <gotwig> pachet: isnt that a  bug maybe in jQuery UI?...
[10:16:53] <pachet> is what a bug
[10:17:00] <gotwig> that you can't do it automaticly
[10:17:05] <gotwig> to new DOM elements
[10:17:08] <pachet> rofl
[10:17:08] <pachet> no
[10:17:24] <gotwig> I use .on a lot...
[10:17:27] <gotwig> so
[10:17:29] <pachet> its completely different
[10:17:47] <pachet> .on() uses delegation to allow you to think that you're binding to elements that don't really exist yet
[10:18:06] <pachet> but really you're just binding to a container that you assume will hold those elements eventually
[10:18:36] <pachet> then when that specified event is triggered on your container, you check to see if its originating element matches the selector that you told jquery to look for
[10:18:39] <pachet> if so, magic happens
[10:18:59] <gotwig> redunancy ftw...
[10:19:40] <gotwig> pachet: so what should I do now
[10:20:03] <pachet> have a function that you pass a reference to a container into
[10:20:12] <gotwig> for resizeable..
[10:20:14] <pachet> that function will check if there are any .whateverclass elements within the container
[10:20:29] <pachet> and call .resizable() on them, with certain parameters
[10:21:57] <ladislaw> if I am using css visibility property hide a node, what is the best way to show it again  through jquery?
[10:22:10] <ladislaw> with jquery*
[10:22:42] <ladislaw> ignore that
[10:24:56] <gotwig> cant do it ;P
[10:31:34] <orentanay> I have a form, and would like to use the Value tag to hold the friendly name of the field for the user, e.g. First Name in fname input field. But I'm not sure what the right name is for the feature that clears this value when a user enters their own text, and restores that default value if nothing is entered. I think I would also need the ability to clear those default value if nothing is
[10:31:34] <orentanay> entered so that the form validation gets tripped. My other concern is that the solution I'm currently using does not seem to like web-kit as it does not seem to function on Safari or FireFox on the Mac. Any suggestions on a jquery plugin that does what I was rambling on about? Thanks.

[11:20:38] <orentanay> I'm looking for some opinions on http://plugins.jquery.com/superLabels/ Specifically, have you found any issues with Mac FireFox and Safari. Thansk.
[11:23:02] <Storm3y_> davemo - I put $(".gal_content").before(".thumbs_wrap2"); in and it never worked :(
[11:29:13] <Tulip> Hi, I have used custom flexslider on hover effect and generated thumbnail and caption for it now I want to  link thumbanail to the slide url I have specified in the backend, I have used jQuery to show the slide url in the anchor tag but somehow anchor tag is not getting worked on normal left but its opening generated url on middle click of mouse. I want to go to that url on click of mouse
[11:32:17] <SoulShadow> oh thank god this channel exists
[11:34:39] <SoulShadow> i'm doing a restaurant website in jquery mobile, and i'm trying to decide the best way to do a menu, if i were to go with a list  nested inside of a (normall hidden) list which then was clicked into a dialog, would it be possible to make that dialog dynamic based on what item was clicked, instead of a separate page for each?
[11:36:12] <SoulShadow> unless someone has a better idea as mine doesn't seem like the best for the end user anyway
[11:37:49] <Tulip> Hi, I have used custom flexslider on hover effect and generated thumbnail and caption for it now I want to  link thumbanail to the slide url I have specified in the backend, I have used jQuery to show the slide url in the anchor tag but somehow anchor tag is not getting worked on normal left but its opening generated url on middle click of mouse.

[11:40:25] <velts> when using .replace does it only replace the first instance?
[11:40:45] <velts> mystring.replace('x', 'z');
[11:40:59] <velts> if mystring is buxx its only outputting buzx
[11:41:05] <velts> instead of buzz
[11:53:12] <masentinel900> Guys Someone how pass data to hidden row of datatables plugin?
[11:55:16] <troop> hello
[11:55:47] <troop> http://pastebin.com/7T0KuTt8 what do you expect? it works weird... it does not print the post data, just creates a copy of selectbox?????
[11:59:58] <mikehenriquez> hello guys, I'm working in a custom full width carousel and I'm having problems doing it infinite, if any of you can give me a hint on how i can do this carousel infinite will be appreciated: http://hsinteractivo.com/visa
[12:03:26] <multi_io> apparently, a JSON expression must be an array or object at the top level? E.g. you can't serialize a single integer, say. Why??
[12:04:29] <systemfault> Who said that?
[12:05:06] <systemfault> ?js JSON.stringify(2);
[12:05:09] <bot-t> systemfault: "2"
[12:05:14] <systemfault> See, it works.
[12:05:19] <multi_io> the Gson library in my case.
[12:05:48] <mikehenriquez> hello guys, I'm working in a custom full width carousel and I'm having problems doing it infinite, if any of you can give me a hint on how i can do this carousel infinite will be appreciated: http://hsinteractivo.com/visa
[12:05:53] <systemfault> It's possibly your library.... but imho, wanting to return magic values seems like an antipattern to me.
[12:05:54] <multi_io> hm, well... apparently that library is more pragmatic.
[12:06:35] <systemfault> At least.. specify what that int is..
[12:07:15] <systemfault> multi_io: You can probably easily convert a Map<String, Integer> to json using gson
[12:07:34] <systemfault> So you don't even require a new class
[12:08:38] <mikehenriquez> because $('#galleryUl li:first').before($('#galleryUl li:last')); is not working in my case
[12:08:39] <mikehenriquez> :S
[12:10:36] <Dirkos> If i use jquery append the text that is appended wont be parsed by dom anymore? How can i escape that text so that it will be XSS safe?
[12:10:46] <brenet_> hi guys.. how can i make this menu to hide whenever i click outside of the button also http://jsfiddle.net/agpHG/
[12:12:14] <Dirkos> brenet_: window.click ?
[12:13:27] <Dirkos> brenet_: or just trigger the click outside your menu (content for example)
[12:13:44] <brenet_> Dirkos: i mean.. is it possible something like $('#start',window).click(function() { ?
[12:15:41] <multi_io> systemfault: I found JsonWriter#setLenient(true), which fixes the issue for me
[12:17:28] <sunbeam> hi, does anyone know how I Can add a certain HTML code right before a certain id#id starts?
[12:17:30] <systemfault> multi_io: Good to know
[12:18:04] <brenet__> went down
[12:18:13] <systemfault> $('#myId').before('<span>HI</span>') ?
[12:18:17] <systemfault> sunbeam ^
[12:18:51] <sunbeam> systemfault: i need to use .append
[12:18:59] <sunbeam> systemfault: oh sorry
[12:19:09] <sunbeam> systemfault: does this add it right before myId?
[12:19:18] <systemfault> That's why it exists.
[12:19:29] <sunbeam> ahh ok thanks
[12:24:26] <brenet__> i have tried this but nothing http://jsfiddle.net/agpHG/1/

[12:34:27] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: it looks like you've greatly confused PHP and javascript
[12:35:02] <mikehenriquez> guys, I'm working in a custom full width carousel and I'm having problems doing it infinite, if any of you can give me a hint on how i can do this carousel infinite will be appreciated: http://hsinteractivo.com/visa

[12:37:43] <masentinel900> And  I'm bringing the data from the database
[12:43:54] <feyd> how can I loop through 3 characters in an element every second? I just want to cycle through letters a, b and c, 1 at a time, every second in an element
[12:51:59] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: why is there php code in your output
[12:53:09] <BillCriswell> feyd: You can use setInterval.
[12:53:20] <feyd> I got it working but it seems so dirty
[12:53:25] <feyd> so, so dirty
[12:54:29] <masentinel900> <NoiseEee>: I s a function that generate the table with data from the database.
[12:54:42] <BillCriswell> feyd: What feels dirty about it?
[12:55:08] <masentinel900> Obviously I also use the javascript for my to do the function who call the table onload the page.
[12:55:22] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: but why in the jsfiddle you pasted is there PHP?
[12:55:58] <masentinel900> <NoiseEee>: http://pastebin.com/zW0kp7bK

[13:00:20] <masentinel900> What is that?
[13:00:35] <NoiseEee> its a sample showing you how to get the contents of the <a> tag?
[13:01:29] <masentinel900> It's what I sent you before!
[13:01:43] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: what are you asking ?
[13:02:09] <masentinel900> var aData = oTable.fnGetData( nTr );
[13:02:21] <masentinel900> $('#tableMainContent tbody td img').live('click', function () { 		var sMt = this.parent.index;
[13:02:29] <NoiseEee> don't use live() anymore.
[13:02:47] <BillCriswell> feyd: http://jsbin.com/ehefuv/1/edit could work.
[13:02:52] <BillCriswell> Ah, he left.
[13:02:59] <masentinel900> I need to replace nTr for a string which takes the value of <a></a>
[13:03:09] <SoulShadow> okay i have a problem guys
[13:03:16] <SoulShadow> i'm building a website in jquery mobile
[13:03:22] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: my example shows you how to do that?  or provide a better fiddle.
[13:03:26] <SoulShadow> and it doesn't work in chrome
[13:03:29] <SoulShadow> mobile or desktop
[13:03:30] <sunbeam> $(".add-something").click(function() {});
[13:03:34] <SoulShadow> it works in browser, firefox, dolphin
[13:03:35] <sunbeam> how can i make this live?
[13:03:45] <sunbeam> so that it also works on elements that have been added after the page was loaded?
[13:04:09] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: $('#idOfCommonParent').on('click','.add-something',function() {})
[13:05:13] <sunbeam> thanks
[13:05:25] <neataroni> i have a couple $.get requests to api's that dont exist yet- how can i make those requests, but then intercept them somehow and give them back fake data?
[13:05:34] <SoulShadow> anyone have any idea
[13:05:35] <SoulShadow> ?
[13:05:59] <shoky> ?demo @ SoulShadow
[13:05:59] <b-ot> SoulShadow: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:06:00] <bot-t> SoulShadow, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:06:32] <masentinel900> But this link http://jsfiddle.net/dHVcA/ was you send me and don´t have more than a simple view table
[13:06:48] <SoulShadow> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8696693/test/index.html
[13:06:52] <SoulShadow> do i have to move it to jsfiddle?
[13:07:21] <SoulShadow> this is just a mock atm, it loads just fine most browsers
[13:07:39] <jump> hi all...How can I use setInterval in .each()? I need to start every iteration after setInterval callback
[13:08:08] <shoky> SoulShadow: the problem is its on dropbox
[13:08:23] <jump> for example...$('selector').each({setInterval(callback and after if next iteration)})
[13:08:27] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: again, what are you trying to do.  put up a few rows of a sample table, and tell us what you want to do when X happens.
[13:08:28] <shoky> SoulShadow: look in chrome console.. [blocked] The page at https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8696693/test/index.html ran insecure content from http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.0/jquery.mobile-1.3.0.min.css.
[13:08:43] <SoulShadow> oh
[13:08:55] <SoulShadow> so it's just because i don't have the css files hosted myself?
[13:08:57] <SoulShadow> o.o
[13:09:19] <bluesm> better to remove elements or hide them?
[13:09:29] <jump> heeey someone
[13:09:55] <bluesm> Better to insert them on the "event" (or keep them hidden and showed them up on event) ?
[13:09:57] <SoulShadow> shoky: i had an idiot moment there, i forgot chrome had a console
[13:09:59] <masentinel900> NoiseEee: See this please  ::  http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/row_details.html
[13:10:32] <shoky> SoulShadow:  see, it works fine in chrome- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/8QvqC/
[13:11:08] <SoulShadow> shoky: so is chrome blocking it just because i don't have the CSS hosted myself and it's cross linking?
[13:11:20] <SoulShadow> interesting that firefox doesn't block it
[13:11:38] <SoulShadow> i have the files, i just hadn't hosted it yet
[13:11:57] <BillCriswell> neataroni: $.ajaxSetup maybe?
[13:12:10] <shoky> SoulShadow: it's because the dropbox is https while the scripts/css you're loading is regular http
[13:12:12] <neataroni> BillCriswell: yea that looks promising
[13:12:28] <SoulShadow> shoky: ah, that would indeed explain it
[13:12:51] <jump> how can I use setInterval in .each()?...who can help me?
[13:13:20] <SoulShadow> shoky: i'm going to go do the walk of shame for not noticing that
[13:13:24] <SoulShadow> thank you
[13:13:29] <shoky> jump: you probably shouldn't
[13:13:33] <shoky> np SoulShadow
[13:13:43] <systemfault> jump: You can't, you need to write your own async loop with setTimeout.
[13:14:40] <jump> I use 2 functions...that call each other
[13:14:51] <jump> and it works...but looks strange
[13:15:28] <jump> I thought dat  .each() functation is more elegant solution
[13:15:37] <masentinel900> <NoiseEee>: Did you saw that?
[13:16:00] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: i did, it seems we cannot communicate clearly.  good luck.
[13:25:36] <masentinel900> Guys some like this  ::  $(this).parents('li').last().children('a').text()};  that allow me to enter by Id of a table and find the value inside of this ::  <tr><td><a>THis_value</a></td></tr>
[13:28:15] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: but presumably you've got multiple rows, so WHICH row do you want?
[13:28:53] <masentinel900> I just have one <tr> tag
[13:29:18] <masentinel900> in the body table
[13:30:04] <NoiseEee> so then assuming it's the last <a> in the row, it would be $('#tableID tr').find('a').last().text()
[13:30:05] <ANNDELL> someone can help me with cutting iframe?
[13:30:31] <ANNDELL> i ha ve iframe and i need hide 3 divs from top of page
[13:32:44] <ANNDELL> somebody can help me?
[13:33:27] <josefrichter__> I have a getCurrentPosition after "pageinit" in jquerymobile, but when I navigate to that page, the browser asks for permission (grey bar in chrome) but no callback is called. when I reload on this very same page, callbacks work ok. any ideas please?
[13:33:35] <mikehenriquez> guys is there's a method in jQuery to validate isf a string is a integer or float?
[13:34:16] <ANNDELL> noone??

[14:11:48] <zergion> $(this).closest(".main-settings-container").find(".return-message").text('<p>' + output + '</p>');
[14:12:12] <zergion> am trying to find the div .return-message in the closest .main-settings-container then change the text
[14:14:57] <velts> zergion: you are trying to write html using .text
[14:15:16] <zergion> I tried with just 'test' earlier so thats not the issue
[14:16:52] <velts> try console.log( $(this).closest(".main-settings-container").find(".return-message").length )
[14:18:00] <zergion> undefined
[14:18:01] <zergion> it says
[14:18:31] <velts> can you show me your markup?
[14:20:51] <zergion> velts sec
[14:21:54] <zergion> http://jsfiddle.net/AWpcH/
[14:21:55] <zergion> there
[14:22:17] <zergion> line 34 is the evil
[14:23:05] <velts> ahh
[14:23:08] <velts> i see what is wrong
[14:23:37] <velts> $(this) is not your input button anymore
[14:23:42] <velts> you scope has changed
[14:24:06] <zergion> gaah, so I set a variable earlier and then use it later on?
[14:24:13] <zergion> var input = this
[14:24:24] <velts> http://jsfiddle.net/AWpcH/1/
[14:24:34] <velts> yah
[14:25:03] <zergion> http://img.mu.cdn.li/Ao/xqefEH.jpg
[14:25:13] <velts> i always use something like -> $this = $(this)
[14:25:32] <velts> $ tells me its a jquey object, and obvsouly this refers to this
[14:25:49] <velts> hah
[14:27:00] <velts> also .html('<p>' + text + '</p>') is bad style
[14:27:40] <velts> you should use $('<p/>', { "text": text });
[14:28:00] <velts> looks kinda weird on one line, but once you format it properly it is much easier to read
[14:40:10] <ladislaw> can you change the value of css property with jquery? e.g. change from visibility: hidden to visibility:show
[14:41:57] <ladislaw> talk to me.
[14:43:35] <yogurt_truck> ladislaw: http://api.jquery.com/css/
[14:43:38] <ladislaw> got it
[14:44:44] <o-R-e-N> I just used browsershots to check my site's cross-compatibility... Sheesh, how depressing :/ lol
[14:45:42] <o-R-e-N> Someone please put me at ease that my site can't be expected to work on 100 different browsers.
[14:45:50] <o-R-e-N> lol
[14:46:38] <Swindlefingers> Gotta know your audience, and whether you practice graceful degredation or progressive enhancement
[14:47:24] <systemfault> Also.. you really have like... 5-6 browsers to support... not 100
[14:47:42] <systemfault> IE8-IE9-IE10 Chrome Firefox Opera
[14:47:51] <o-R-e-N> Okay. And thanks btw for the response :)
[14:47:54] <systemfault> And Opera isn't mendatory IMHO :P
[14:48:04] <Swindlefingers> And if you have analytics data already, you might be able to drop a few of thems depending on what kind of time you have
[14:48:21] <o-R-e-N> browserchecks took screens of some very old versions -- some of which I didn't even know about.
[14:48:30] <Swindlefingers> oh pssh
[14:48:31] <o-R-e-N> Ah, I see.
[14:48:33] <djj_> Has anyone used ehighlight.js before - https://ehighlight.pagodabox.com/ ?
[14:49:05] <Swindlefingers> like systemfault said - they might have a bunch of browsers, but based on your audience - only a few are important
[14:50:18] <o-R-e-N> So it sounds like I don't have to kill myself worrying about Firefox 1.5.0.12 windows 2003.
[14:52:05] <systemfault> Right...
[14:52:09] <Swindlefingers> If for some bizarre reason more than 5-10% of my users were on that browser, I might care.
[14:53:03] <o-R-e-N> lol
[14:53:05] <o-R-e-N> Are there any kinda pages/studies you two keep bookmarked for things like this? Maybe showing general percentages of which browsers/versions are being used by the masses?
[14:53:43] <xiphiasx_> hi
[14:53:54] <xiphiasx_> i want to have a "swipe" event on all <tr>'s in a <table>
[14:53:55] <Swindlefingers> I usually base it off the site's analytics - since some sites have a different demographic and don't follow world-wide usage
[14:54:03] <xiphiasx_> i don't know how to do that however
[14:54:27] <o-R-e-N> That makes sense, Swindlefingers. Thanks again!
[14:54:50] <Swindlefingers> No probs, glad you don't have to have nightmares about IE6 anymore :)
[14:54:59] <o-R-e-N> Haha
[14:56:25] <o-R-e-N> I've been trying to avoid any possible problems, but it's starting to sound like I may HAVE to have a few problems from users before I know what to improve, if anything.
[14:56:29] <o-R-e-N> If that even makes sense.
[14:56:48] <Swindlefingers> I mean - world-wide browser data is always a good starting point
[14:57:16] <Swindlefingers> if that's what you're referring to
[14:57:18] <o-R-e-N> Okay, that sounds google-able!
[14:57:39] <o-R-e-N> Right -- a starting point was exactly what I meant.
[14:58:35] <Swindlefingers> And using graceful degradation to help make sure the user can still use your site to best of her browser's ability - she might not get the fancy website, but it's still usable
[14:59:16] <o-R-e-N> Right
[15:00:08] <o-R-e-N> But as a starting point, "IE8-IE9-IE10 Chrome Firefox Opera" should be fine? Then monitor analytics, correct?
[15:00:20] <o-R-e-N> My site is a simple e-commerce site.
[15:00:56] <Swindlefingers> Yeah, that's usually my basic compatibility list
[15:01:08] <o-R-e-N> K
[15:01:28] <Swindlefingers> Although I don't usually check Opera haha
[15:01:34] <xiphiasx_> hm
[15:01:37] <systemfault> I set my baseline to IE9 :P If you use IE8, you'll get a perfectly readable and usable website... but without rounded corners... or shadows
[15:01:45] <Swindlefingers> Yep, same
[15:01:54] <o-R-e-N> And how far back do you generally check for Firefox?
[15:01:56] <Swindlefingers> if you want a nice site, upgrade
[15:02:04] <o-R-e-N> haha
[15:02:07] <o-R-e-N> true
[15:02:16] <xiphiasx_> does anyone know how to change only a certain part of a page (e.g. loading #whatever while keeping the rest of page itself unchanged)
[15:02:37] <Swindlefingers> I usually just do one version back, myself - or further back if my analytics tell me people are using more versions
[15:03:44] <o-R-e-N> Man, you guys are always great! I have such clarity now :))
[15:05:16] <o-R-e-N> Thanks again, Swindlefingers and systemfault for having patience and sharing some of your knowledge.
[15:06:22] <systemfault> You're welcome
[15:07:50] <BaNzounet> Hey guys, I've this to generate a popover : $(".example_top").click(function(){ $(this).popover({placement:'top'}); return false; }); but I don't know why I've to click twice on my link to make it works, any idea?
[15:10:33] <BaNzounet> the event is triggered but the popover doesn't appear on the first click :/
[15:19:17] <anew> what does 'wrapped in jquery' mean
[15:19:30] <anew> when i place $.element it becomes [<div></div>]
[15:19:35] <anew> i dont understand why
[15:20:13] <anew> i can apply jq functions to it
[15:20:14] <anew> ok
[15:29:21] <ronson> So I have a form with a text input.  I write a double quote in the input and press save.  Now my next page is the view page and I have the form data pulled with an AJAX call to retrieve the JSON.  But my JSON and page break because of the extra double quote.  How do I get around this?
[15:29:47] <ronson> At which point do I need to escape my data?
[15:29:58] <KWhat_Work> ronson: you need to sanitize
[15:31:00] <portishead> hey guys, on my index.js page ('#tabs').width=screen.width; doesn't change the width of the table
[15:31:13] <KWhat_Work> let me rephrase that, if its doing what I think its doing, you should probably stop creating web apps and do some reading first
[15:32:25] <KWhat_Work> portishead: not enough info
[15:35:18] <portishead> KWhat_Work: I am working with phonegap, building a cross-platform application for mobiles, on the index.html I have set a table with id="tabs"
[15:35:42] <portishead> when I run that command through chrome js console it runs smooth and changes the width of the table
[15:38:06] <KWhat_Work> portishead: hmm never run into anything like that before assuming the missing $ was a typeo.
[15:38:32] <KWhat_Work> unless there is a min width css applied or something like that
[15:38:55] <shoky> uhm  it's $('#tabs').width( screen.width )
[15:41:22] <ronson> KWhat_Work:  how does that work
[15:42:08] <KWhat_Work> ronson: if your taking crap in from the user and the putting it back in the page without sanitizing something its call code injection and leads to awesome stuff like XSS.
[15:42:35] <KWhat_Work> do everyone on earth a favor and stop writing code until you understand that
[15:42:42] <coldhead> wow, harsh
[15:43:04] <portishead> KWhat_Work: please don't talk like that.
[15:43:14] <portishead> ronson: don't mind the troll.
[15:44:03] <KWhat_Work> you're all sympathetic now...
[15:49:43] <bergamot> ello
[15:50:08] <bergamot> anyone know of a way to use $.when and $.then with an anonymous function?
[15:50:36] <coldhead> i appreciate the spirit of "avoid creating XSS vulnerabilities" but there's kinder and gentler ways of expressing that
[15:51:30] <ronson> I know what it is
[15:51:37] <ronson> But Im a front-end developer
[15:51:43] <ronson> I'm trying to explain it to an intern
[15:52:15] <ronson> im trying to see how others explain it / tell people to prevent it
[15:52:42] <ronson> he was using string replace, i said to escape, then i said to escape going in, but then our handlebars templates causes it to render oddly, etc
[15:53:32] <ronson> And telling anyone to stop writing code until they're better at writing code is the dumbest advice you can give.  Writing code is what makes you better at writing code.
[15:53:42] <coldhead> also reading code
[15:53:59] <KWhat_Work> ok dont put it in production or give it to anyone or publish it
[15:54:03] <coldhead> and reading alice's adventures in wonderland, strangely
[15:54:16] <ronson> If he hadn't hit this obstacle he would never have learned when/where/how to apply the knowledge practically
[15:54:36] <tw2113> coldhead never publishes code
[15:55:05] <KWhat_Work> ehh ronson paste your code somewhere
[15:55:52] <ronson> I have nothing to paste, I don't want a fix just the best way to explain it
[15:55:57] <KWhat_Work> the reason i get frustrated with that is because to may people grab a 6 pack instead of doing software engineering and just beat  out something and put it into production
[15:56:06] <peteyg> Does $.ajaxSetup() affect shortcut calls like $.get and $.getScript?
[15:56:35] <KWhat_Work> ronson: just explain it as code injection
[15:56:48] <ronson> peteyg: yes it should
[15:56:55] <peteyg> ronson: Awesome, thanks.
[15:57:15] <KWhat_Work> thats really the underlying principal if the countless things that could go wrong
[15:57:22] <ronson> KWhat_Work: I have but i dont have the back end know how to explain how/where to do it lol
[15:57:36] <ronson> As I said, a single double quote broke the whole thing
[15:57:53] * yogurt_truck grabs a 6 pack _and_ does software engineering
[15:59:34] <coldhead> KWhat_Work: almost no one is really smart enough to do software well, might as well have a few beers
[16:00:21] <ronson> what coldhead said
[16:01:07] <Foxhoundz> yogurt_truck: bug fixing*
[16:05:17] <Max-P> Hi there! Is there a quick way to have a jQuery dialog always be on top of another one? (Got an edit dialog, and a tool dialog; the tool dialog should always be on top)
[16:06:19] <coldhead> sounds like a job for z-index
[16:06:47] <Max-P> coldhead, But jQuery overrides the z-index because it calls moveToTop() internally :/
[16:07:39] <coldhead> sounds like a job for z-index: !important;
[16:09:06] <velts> Max-P: i can never think of a situation where more then one dialog windows should be open
[16:09:10] <bergamot> can anyone think of a method to wait for xhr data from an ajax call to return, but on a completely different function? can you have a listener for ajax data?
[16:10:20] <Max-P> velts, I don't either, but the design have a negative IQ so I have to deal with it ><
[16:10:29] <coldhead> ?ajaxstart
[16:10:30] <bot-t> .ajaxStart(handler): Register a handler to be called when the first Ajax request begins. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[16:10:48] <coldhead> bergamot: you can use that to bind a handler for ALL ajax events
[16:11:05] <Max-P> bergamot, $.ajax({type: 'json', success: function(data) { /* Your code here once the ajax is done */} })  does this help?
[16:11:10] <coldhead> but you probably just want to use deferreds, no?
[16:11:21] <dcherman> Max-P: i'd probably use a combination of http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-dialogClass and a class with zIndex or something, so you could name your index like "ui-top-dialog"
[16:11:53] <velts> bergamot: you have no access to the orginal $.ajax call?
[16:11:54] <dcherman> s/index/class
[16:12:02] <bergamot> coldhead, well, an anonymous function is making the call, I need to wait for that call to succeed, but wait for it to succeed on a different function
[16:12:11] <bergamot> velts, it's an anonymous function
[16:12:28] <bergamot> it's the ajax addition to the chosen.jquery plugin
[16:12:40] <coldhead> still sounds like a job for deferreds to me
[16:12:47] <coldhead> but it's my first day using jQuery
[16:13:05] <aghouseh> anyone know if its possible to manually propagate a hover from a youtube video in an iframe to the parent div of the iframe itself? :|
[16:13:17] <bergamot> defferds on your first day? You may just be an early bloomer
[16:13:38] <clu3> is there a log for this channel somewhere guys thanks
[16:13:46] <Max-P> bergamot, You mean, you want another function to sits there and wait for the ajax call to finish? The only solution there might be busy-waiting, you are better making your code fully deffered
[16:14:20] <velts> ?ajaxSuccess
[16:14:21] <bot-t> .ajaxSuccess(handler): Attach a function to be executed whenever an Ajax request completes successfully. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[16:14:21] <coldhead> clu3: http://irc.jquery.org/#jquery/
[16:14:31] <bergamot> Max-P, perhaps. I thought there might be a way to just detect post data, and act on it....
[16:14:35] <clu3> coldhead thanks heaps
[16:14:39] <coldhead> oh danke velts
[16:14:52] <Max-P> dcherman, Now that's an answer, worked fine! Thanks
[16:15:04] <velts> coldhead: http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[16:15:31] <coldhead> yes, the success one slipped my mind
[16:15:36] <coldhead> i must be overusing ajaxstart
[16:15:37] <velts> just need to find what you want to listen on
[16:15:54] <bergamot> ajaxSucess does work if it's bound to $(document), but inside of a function that finishes executing, it doesn
[16:15:57] <bergamot> 't
[16:16:17] <bergamot> is there a way to force it to wait for data to come back?
[16:16:56] <velts> sorry coldhead, thought you were the orginal person who asked
[16:17:04] <velts> that was meant for bergamot :P
[16:17:22] <bergamot> I figured :)
[16:18:03] <velts> bergamot: you need to setup ajaxSuccess on load
[16:18:10] <Max-P> bergamot, you can set async: false, but it will lock the browser while the request is processing, this is a really bad solution. You should really find a better way for the success event to be sent to the right place without waiting anywhere
[16:19:04] <coldhead> i still maintain that's with deferreds
[16:19:07] <dblosevn> Hey, how can i make this valid json buttons: {'' + mdialog.button1 + '': function() {
[16:19:20] <bergamot> velts, that's one way I figured it could be done, have a partial function run, then have the onload ajaxSuccess call the stuff that needs to happen after data comes back, but was hoping for something more succinct... guess I'll try that then
[16:20:16] <dblosevn> I thought I could force it to interpolate the string by including '' + around the key but I get syntax erro unexpected + which is kind of what i was afraid of before I wrote that
[16:21:14] <velts> dblosevn: "buttons" : { "name": mdialog.button1, "value": function() { } };
[16:21:26] <dblosevn> oh i guess theres another initalization option that doesnt require that syntax
[16:21:31] <velts> i have no idea what yourfunction is
[16:30:03] <Emn1ty|Work> .find method is erroring in IE, anyone got some input on how to fix it?
[16:30:15] <Emn1ty|Work> Error - Message: Object doesn't support this property or method
[16:30:15] <Emn1ty|Work> Line: 842
[16:30:15] <Emn1ty|Work> Char: 4
[16:30:15] <Emn1ty|Work> Code: 0
[16:30:27] <Emn1ty|Work> code on that line: var nameFields = el.find(".form-name");
[16:31:12] <coldhead> does it work if you try $(el).find(".form-name") ?
[16:32:48] <Emn1ty|Work> coldhead, its being passed into the function as $(currFormID)
[16:33:15] <Emn1ty|Work> so el = $('#form-id');
[16:33:16] <adavia> hi.. im wondering how can i also hide this menu clicking outside the button http://jsfiddle.net/yFFBV/
[16:33:48] <dblosevn> Emn1ty|Work: does currFormID have the # in it?
[16:34:14] <dblosevn> or should it be $('#' + currFormID)
[16:34:16] <Emn1ty|Work> I can log it to see what's going on, just a sec
[16:34:34] <Emn1ty|Work> dblosevn, its set with - var currFormID = "#form" + currentForm;
[16:34:43] <Emn1ty|Work> so the # is there
[16:34:51] <dblosevn> whats currentForm
[16:35:07] <Emn1ty|Work> a number representing which form in a series of forms it is.
[16:35:12] <dblosevn> log it
[16:35:18] <Emn1ty|Work> So it should be #form1, or #form2, etc.
[16:35:24] <Emn1ty|Work> k
[16:35:33] <dblosevn> id never use such trickery with forms and ids
[16:35:53] <Emn1ty|Work> me neither
[16:35:56] <dblosevn> pass a refernce to the form it self around to all the methods that need it, ids are overrated
[16:36:00] <Emn1ty|Work> but I didn't write this
[16:36:27] <adavia> ?
[16:37:37] <dblosevn> eg $('form.someclass').submit(function () { anotherMethod($(this)); })
[16:38:15] <Max-P> adavia: You need to bind "click" on <body> when you open the menu to catch the click outside event, and when you get the event, unbind it and hide the menu.
[16:38:17] <velts> adavia: i put a click event on body, and check if the menu is open, then close it
[16:38:29] <velts> hah
[16:39:19] <velts> Maz-P: wouldnt that mean the next time you wanted to open that menu you couldnt? since the even is unbound?
[16:39:35] <dblosevn> i want to use a ui dialog as a preview but i want it always visible on the page while your modifying the title, message, and button text and im having a heck of a time succeding in doing it
[16:40:06] <coldhead> Emn1ty|Work: if el is DEFINITELY a $() then el should DEFINITELY have find(). it doesn't hurt to wrap it again, you could even do $( $( $( el ) ) ).find()
[16:40:16] <Max-P> velts, No, you bind it on open, keep that reference, and unbind it when the event is caught or the menu is closed. That way, you don't have your handler fired each time the page is clicked somewhere (that includes scrolling, as it's mouse button 4 and 5)
[16:40:26] <dblosevn> I can make the ui dialog look the way i want but it kills the fancybox thats around it
[16:40:36] <velts> ahh cool
[16:41:24] <adavia> Well
[16:41:25] <adavia> ill try
[16:41:53] <dblosevn> coldhead: it would only have find if $(currFormID) matched something
[16:42:07] <coldhead> i disagree
[16:42:23] <dblosevn> well find would be there but it would still cause a fatal
[16:42:41] <coldhead> $().find('aids') works for me
[16:42:43] <coldhead> as does
[16:42:50] <coldhead> $('#aidsaidsaids').find('aids')
[16:42:57] <adavia> Max-P:  should i use bind() ?
[16:43:00] <coldhead> i just get [] back
[16:43:04] <coldhead> but no error
[16:43:06] <dblosevn> as long as #aidsaidsaids exists
[16:43:12] <coldhead> no, even when it doesn't
[16:43:14] <coldhead> and it doesn't
[16:43:25] <dblosevn> and $() will always match window
[16:43:50] <coldhead> even if your $() is empty it still has a find() method
[16:43:56] <Max-P> adavia, $('body').once('click.mysupermenu', function() { /* Close the menu */ });
[16:44:10] <dblosevn> i bet this fatals
[16:44:13] <Max-P> adajad, one( *
[16:44:25] <dblosevn> $().find('#aids').show();
[16:44:55] <coldhead> not for me it doesn't :P
[16:45:12] <Max-P> dblosevn, It will work, but do nothing. jQuery will loop over an empty array, which does nothing.
[16:45:14] <dblosevn> it doesnt for me either
[16:45:34] <Max-P> dblosevn, What version of jQuery? Are you using strict mode?
[16:45:42] <dblosevn> weird ive had issues with that in the past, in latest that works
[16:46:46] <Emn1ty|Work> coldhead, checking in IE8 mode on my computer I'm getting "Object doesn't support property or method 'trim' "
[16:47:07] <dblosevn> i ended up wrapping in in a try/catch block guess that issue is resolved, the only time i got the issue was if I tryied to match on a parent that didnt exist then find a child within the nonexistant parent then do something with it
[16:47:56] <dblosevn> eg like $('#nonexistant').find('a').attr('href', 'http://google.com');
[16:48:16] <dblosevn> i used to get a failure on .attr
[16:49:01] <Max-P> It returns an empty array for me, weird.
[16:49:07] <dblosevn> ya it works now
[16:49:24] <aghouseh> Emn1ty|Work: trim is tricky for ie..i think you have to use it like var text = $.trim($('.ele').text());
[16:49:25] <coldhead> for a second i was about to say "HEY THAT BREAKS FOR ME TOO" but then i realised i was running it in the console of a screenshot and not an actual page >: |
[16:49:50] <dblosevn> might have been a resolved bug
[16:50:17] <Emn1ty|Work> aghouseh, I think its because they are chaining it and IE doesn't like that: tempObj[key_marital] = $(item).text().trim();
[16:50:28] <aghouseh> yeah you cant do that
[16:50:35] <aghouseh> do $.trim($(item.text());
[16:50:38] <Emn1ty|Work> that's an easy fix at least
[16:50:53] <aghouseh> er $.trim($(item).text())
[16:51:38] <Emn1ty|Work> tempObj[key_marital] = $.trim($item.text());
[16:51:40] <Emn1ty|Work> right?
[16:51:45] <aghouseh> yup
[16:51:59] <aghouseh> i had the same issue, worked fine in webkit/ff, but IE didnt like it
[16:52:33] <Emn1ty|Work> ie seems to not like a lot of things
[16:52:39] <aghouseh> its mutual
[16:52:46] <Emn1ty|Work> definitely
[16:53:21] <Emn1ty|Work> oh sheesh there's a TON of these
[16:54:38] <coldhead> wait Emn1ty|Work are you patching jQuery?
[16:54:55] <Emn1ty|Work> coldhead, no, I'm patching code written by my team
[16:55:02] <Emn1ty|Work> and fortunately there wasn't as many as I thought :P
[16:55:12] <coldhead> oh okay
[16:55:22] <coldhead> because you COULD have shimmed trim() onto the string prototype
[16:55:34] <aghouseh> yeah
[16:55:38] <aghouseh> was just working up a pastie for that :)
[16:56:31] <Emn1ty|Work> now I get to try and find an alternative to the cruddy $_SERVER['HTTP_REFFERER'] stuff they threw in this site.
[16:56:53] <Emn1ty|Work> more IE hate on the way
[16:56:58] <aghouseh> http://pastebin.com/BVhJcxKp
[16:58:34] <aghouseh> i wonder why $ele.text().trim() works in ff/webkit. are they not defining String.prototype.trim in IE but they ARE in webkit/ff?
[16:59:02] <velts> aghouseh: do you have jquery included on the page?
[16:59:29] <aghouseh> yeah
[16:59:40] <aghouseh> doesnt really matter tho
[16:59:44] <adavia> i have tried this http://jsfiddle.net/yFFBV/2/ but nothing =/
[16:59:46] <velts> so why are you creating a prototype for trim?
[16:59:49] <aghouseh> $ele.text() returns a string
[16:59:59] <aghouseh> so you cant chain it
[17:00:03] <aghouseh> as a jquery item
[17:01:14] <aghouseh> adavia: what are you trying to do there? toggle the menu with the button?
[17:02:18] <adavia> aghouseh:  im trying to open de menu clicking the button but then hide it clicking the button.. or outside
[17:02:25] <aghouseh> ah
[17:08:36] <coldhead> if i'm falling then i'm falling at her feet
[17:10:38] <BaNzounet> Anyone has an idea why I've to click always once to make a bootstrap popover works?
[17:11:12] <aghouseh> are you doing $(item).click(function() { $(this).popover(); }); or just $(item).popover();
[17:12:31] <BaNzounet> I'm using click(){..}
[17:12:41] <aghouseh> try just doing .popover()
[17:12:46] <aghouseh> makes sense that would be it
[17:14:53] <BaNzounet> Without click(...) it doesn't work
[17:15:10] <aghouseh> hm
[17:15:35] <aghouseh> are you passing options or setting data attributes?
[17:16:52] <BaNzounet> aghouseh: data attributes but I'm trying to bind multiple element with the same name
[17:17:00] <aghouseh> yeah, same class?
[17:17:01] <aghouseh> thats okay
[17:17:02] <BaNzounet> y
[17:17:07] <aghouseh> are you wrapping it in a domready function?
[17:17:21] <aghouseh> $(function(){ $('.selector').popover(); });
[17:18:34] <djj_> Is it possible to apply the jquery dialog to the .selectable?
[17:19:04] <BaNzounet> aghouseh: still not working inside the function :s
[17:19:09] <aghouseh> hm
[17:20:35] <brend_> blaaa
[17:32:46] <djj_> Is there anything else that I need to do in order to get the jquery selectable to work - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5192455 ? I am not receiving any errors in fb either
[17:33:27] <BaNzounet> aghouseh: Mhum I had an error in my .js file, it's working now
[17:33:29] <BaNzounet> aghouseh: thanks
[17:33:44] <aghouseh> ;)
[17:33:45] <aghouseh> NP
[17:33:50] <aghouseh> here i am slaving away on a codepen
[17:33:56] <aghouseh> but i want a twitter bootstrap base one anyway
[17:33:58] <aghouseh> :p
[17:35:00] <tw2113> bootstrap is too mainstream for me
[17:36:28] <aghouseh> yea yea
[17:36:38] <aghouseh> that new flat-ui kit looks really nice with it tho

[17:38:25] <tw2113> they need to do a twitter flexboot or something
[17:38:28] <tw2113> flexbox based
[17:39:51] <coldhead> do people even really visit sites that aren't facebook?

[17:47:22] <tds5016> hey. It looks like jquery mobile is exploding in my face....
[17:47:58] <tds5016> when I try to add a panel with $('#divId').panel() and then I open the panel, it doesn't animate.
[17:48:07] <tds5016> this is on chrome where, I know that animations are supported.
[17:48:32] <tds5016> also, it appears I can't find $('body') and my css is for some reason being overridden by jquery mobile.
[17:48:33] <tds5016> wtF?!
[17:51:01] <tds5016> can anyone help me out?
[17:51:23] <tds5016> also, why does it look like my body tags, etc are having a ton of classes added to them?
[17:58:59] <velcrobots> having some trouble getting the width right using jscrollpane: http://inspirawebdesign.us/
[18:12:11] <djj_> Is there any possible reason why my .selectable will not work. - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5192710 I am trying to get the selectable to work with the jquery-ui dialog so that when you select a number of cells a dialog then appears.
[18:31:57] <tds5016> cans someone please help me figure out how to get panels working?
[18:32:11] <tds5016> it looks like I can't close it without manually calling the close function.
[18:32:23] <tds5016> what element should I be appending the panel div to?
[18:36:47] <tds5016> bueler?
[18:36:50] <tds5016> bueler?
[18:46:15] <tds5016> no love for the panels?
[18:49:19] <coldhead> tds5016: 'Try calling .trigger("create") on the element with the new content.'
[18:49:27] <coldhead> that will mobilify it for you
[18:49:39] <coldhead> apparently
[18:50:11] <tds5016> coldhead: mobilify?
[18:50:22] <coldhead> make it jquery mobilish
[18:50:27] <coldhead> i just made that word up
[18:50:32] <coldhead> i'm sorry it didn't go better
[18:51:04] <tds5016> coldhead: no luck.
[18:51:22] <coldhead> i got that from here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7999436/jquery-mobile-does-not-apply-styles-after-dynamically-adding-content
[18:56:44] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/
[18:56:54] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/4Qwy4/
[18:56:59] <tds5016> why in the hell would that break?
[18:57:56] <tds5016> asdf1 should show up there, no?
[18:58:01] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016 probably cause you are using body in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/4Qwy4/1/
[18:58:16] <LocalPCGuy> tds5015 changed it to divs, worked for me
[18:58:46] <tds5016> LocalPCGuy: good call. it works when I don't have jqm1.3.0
[18:59:20] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/4Qwy4/3/
[18:59:23] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016 I should say, it works a little too well, since it is inserting divs into divs, it doubles up a few times
[18:59:54] <coldhead> where do things go wronnng
[19:00:30] <tds5016> all I want is panels.... looks like jqm 1.3.0 is doing some craziness....
[19:04:13] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/4Qwy4/3/
[19:04:26] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/4Qwy4/4/
[19:04:30] <tds5016> there's an example of it breaking.
[19:05:27] <tds5016> coldhead: ^^ sorry, just updated. wanted to make sure you noticed.
[19:10:35] <tds5016> gotta run. if anyone can help me out, please let me know.
[19:10:47] <tds5016> I'll be back tomorrow with the same question.
[19:13:31] <coldhead> i am insufficiently familiar with jqm to assist much :|
[19:21:03] <b1lly> bah
[19:21:06] <b1lly> so
[19:21:08] <b1lly> im debating using
[19:21:12] <b1lly> canvas for a 2d game
[19:21:18] <k_sze[work]> The 'data' component to $.ajax() should not be encoded by encodeURI or encodeURIComponent beforehand, right?
[19:23:05] <Max-P> k_sze[work], No, jquery does it by itself unless you change the content-type
[19:23:30] <k_sze[work]> Max-P: I mean if 'data' is a plain object, not a string already.
[19:24:25] <Max-P> k_sze[work], jQuery converts it to PHP-style forms, splitting the sub-object into field[0][2][key][something]=value
[19:24:50] <k_sze[work]> That sounds good. :D
[19:24:52] <k_sze[work]> thanks
[19:34:16] <o-R-e-N> anyone tried/use -prefix-free?
[19:34:25] <track7> can anyone assist me in adding lines to code to store this playhistory information in a flat file?
[19:34:25] <o-R-e-N> http://leaverou.github.com/prefixfree/
[19:35:08] <tw2113> i think i have it in a site or two
[19:35:56] <track7> whats the website for showing code?
[19:38:11] <LocalPCGuy> ?jsfiddle
[19:38:12] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[19:45:04] <track7> any freelance javascript developers here?

[20:00:53] <ss23> Hi guys, not sure if I should be asking here or somewhere else, but I'm using jQuery and it seems to be fairly jQuery specific, so I'll try here. I'm getting a "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ,", coming from my jquery.js. However, the line of code that causes this problem is seemingly innocent. https://gist.github.com/ss23/5193401 When I comment out mapOpts, it works fine. In regards to whats working / not working, it seems the submit button in this sy
[20:08:03] <shoky> ss23: your message got cut off
[20:08:12] <ss23>  In regards to whats working / not working, it seems the submit button in this system I'm using is being hooked to make
[20:08:15] <ss23>                  it submit with AJAX. Is there any kind of conflict that mapopts could cause to create a syntax error when someone pushes the submit button, vs no error when mapopts isn't defined?
[20:09:36] <shoky> ss23: can you reproduce the error here- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/X5r8r/1092/
[20:09:49] <portishead>    $('#events').click(function() {  $('#content').append('<p>Test</p>'); }); whats wrong over here? where events is <td id="events">events</events>
[20:10:38] <ss23> shoky: No, I cannot. I suspect some kind of conflict with the system I'm using, but given how unhelpful the error message is "syntax error", and it happening when I define a variable, I'm unsure how to debug.
[20:11:39] <shoky> ss23:  it's that line throwing the error?
[20:12:53] <ss23> shoky: No, I can't track down where the error comes from exactly, since jQuery is calling an eval. Let me take a quick screenshot so I can show how Chrome presents it (sorry, I'm not all that familiar with Javascript/jQuery etc)
[20:13:10] <shoky> ss23:  does the stack trace show something about parsing JSON ?
[20:13:57] <ss23> shoky: Not that I can notice - http://screencast.com/t/iWrkHdGPLeMM
[20:14:54] <shoky> uhm what's all stuff ..
[20:15:49] <ss23> Thats the error I get.
[20:16:03] <shoky> maybe you're doing a JSONP request but the server is returning JSON
[20:16:17] <ss23> My code isn't anything to do with JSON though?
[20:16:38] <shoky> i dont know what your code IS anything to do with
[20:16:46] <ss23> When I comment out my code, it works fine, there is no error
[20:17:06] <shoky> nor what jquery.entwine is or what you're doing in LeftAndMain.js:443 and :404
[20:17:24] <ss23> At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if it was a bug in the system rather than my code, given that defining a variable seems to be what triggers it, but I was looking for some poninters on at least how I can debug something like this
[20:17:41] <shoky> i'm sure it's not the "defining a variable" part
[20:17:54] <shoky> if it really is that line, it's from the google.map API call
[20:17:56] <ss23> But that's what triggers the sytanx error, as far as I can see
[20:18:17] <shoky> you're not just defining a variable..
[20:18:20] <ss23> Yes, I see
[20:18:35] <ss23> It's annoying that the error doesn't happen at the time that code executes, but it happens later when the submit button is pressed...
[20:19:23] <shoky> what happens at LeftAndMain.js:443 and :404  ?
[20:19:33] <shoky> and 283
[20:20:03] <ss23> 443: contentEl.replaceWith(newContentEl); 404: $.each(newFragments, function(newFragment, html) { 283: var newContentEls = self.handleAjaxResponse(data, status, xhr);
[20:20:33] <shoky> looks like a buncha stuff that could go wrong ;p
[20:20:53] <ss23> Indeed! as does seem to be happening :<
[20:21:01] <ss23> Wah, I wish my Javascript skills were enough to actually debug this >.<
[20:21:20] <shoky> if you had a live link i could help debug further
[20:21:37] <ss23> I do!
[20:21:42] <ss23> One sec
[20:21:42] <shoky> derp
[20:22:12] <ss23> Sorry, it's behind a login, I'll PM you details (don't hack me, and all that :P)
[20:22:22] <shoky> at yer own risk ;p
[20:24:54] <djj_> Can someone confirm if this is correct - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5193107 I am trying to get the dialog to appear upon selecting my table cells
[20:31:03] <crankharder> why is slideUp adding margin-top of like 7px and slowly decrementing that along with the height?
[20:43:38] <aniasis> For some reason jQuery 1.9 is locking up in Safari, but I am unable to see an error.
[20:43:59] <aniasis> I don't use Safari nor Macs so debuggins it is difficult
[20:45:03] <coldhead> aniasis: you'll need to find the bare minimum amount of code which causes safari to lock up
[20:45:11] <coldhead> and put it on jsfiddle
[20:45:18] <coldhead> then we can sound the alarms
[20:45:43] <aniasis> your're right
[20:46:12] <aniasis> I see in the browser console it is hitting a breakpoint.
[20:46:17] <aniasis> For what reason I don't know.
[20:46:28] <aniasis> It is on the $.each
[20:47:16] <coldhead> disable the breakpoint?
[20:47:16] <aniasis> give me a moment to debug
[20:47:36] <aniasis> I never added the breakpoint
[20:47:48] <LocalPCGuy> make sure you don't have "debugger;" in your code
[20:50:13] <coldhead> if you don't use safari much maybe someone added it for you
[20:50:23] <coldhead> i don't believe the 'debugger' keyword appears in the jQ src
[20:50:50] <JesperA> i am handsome
[20:50:56] <LocalPCGuy> not a jQuery spec thing, it triggers a breakpoint in chrome inspector/firebug
[20:52:55] <coldhead> but if the debugger is opening when jquery is loaded... and jquery doesn't have that keyword in the source...
[20:53:05] <coldhead> it must be a manual breakpoint set in the browser
[20:53:47] <LocalPCGuy> I missed the part where he said it was jQuery itself stopping, my bad
[20:55:13] <coldhead> try to keep up :P
[20:55:58] <nocturne7> guys, I need some friendly recommendation about choosing a proper javascript grid
[20:56:58] <tds5016> can someone help me out with jquery mobile panel?
[20:56:59] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/4Qwy4/5/
[20:57:22] <tds5016> that explains the multitude of issues... but basically there are problems with it not hiding/showing.
[21:02:14] <tds5016> anyone?
[21:04:44] <crankharder> what is happening here: http://jsfiddle.net/CwWPw/11/
[21:04:54] <crankharder> the li that's getting slid up is getting margin-top added for some reason
[21:05:05] <crankharder> if you add border to the li, then the effect goes away...
[21:06:03] <coldhead> god can't you people solve your own problems for once? WE'RE TRYING TO GET DRUNK HERE
[21:06:42] <crankharder> I was drunk enough for everyone friday, and saturday
[21:06:45] <crankharder> and sunday come to think of it
[21:06:50] <crankharder> WORK TIME
[21:07:45] <portishead> how do I work with tabs? I saw there's an interface for tabs with jquery
[21:09:05] <LocalPCGuy> ?tabs @ portishead
[21:09:07] <bot-t> portishead, UI/API/1.8/Tabs - jQuery Wiki - Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space, much like an accordion. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Tabs
[21:09:24] <LocalPCGuy> portishead that would be part of jQuery UI
[21:10:16] <coldhead> crankharder: i suspect your problem relates to the CSS display property
[21:10:26] <coldhead> it's display: list-item initially
[21:10:34] <coldhead> and jQuery changes that to display:block for the animation
[21:10:43] <coldhead> which means it probably has different margin/border behaviour
[21:10:55] <coldhead> try styling with display:block initially and you shouldn't see it change
[21:11:13] <tds5016> anyoen able to help figure out how to what's going on witht he panels?
[21:11:28] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/4Qwy4/5/
[21:14:00] <coldhead> tds5016: Cork should be around soon, he knows mobile stuff
[21:14:17] <tds5016> awesome! thanks man.
[21:15:04] <coldhead> now to pray he didn't die in a horrible train accident today
[21:16:14] <tds5016> do you work on jquery coldhead? I always see you in here answering questions....
[21:16:48] <coldhead> god no, i just have a very boring job
[21:16:59] <coldhead> i don't know enough to do anything useful for jquery
[21:17:04] <coldhead> it's pretty much my first day
[21:17:08] <tds5016> coldhead: I was thinking of taking flying lessons.... then I realized how terrible I would be at that, and I'm pretty sure I'd die a horrible death. haha.
[21:17:34] <tds5016> do you have a job working with jquery? haha. I am always curious where the "experts" come from that hang out on IRC.
[21:17:35] <tds5016> haha.
[21:18:33] <coldhead> most of them work for consultancies or medium sized digital agencies
[21:18:56] <coldhead> and the real tragics are self employed and so have nothing better to do with their time
[21:19:30] <tds5016> that'd be depressing as hell. haha.
[21:19:46] <coldhead> there but for the grace of god...
[21:20:18] <tds5016> no joke. I was saying that cuz I have no idea how I have a job. haha.
[21:21:36] <coldhead> yeah me either
[21:21:58] <coldhead> my high standards of personal hygiene perhaps
[21:22:15] <LocalPCGuy> I tried hanging out in IRC during work time - I get nothing done when I do that
[21:23:01] <crankharder> coldhead: negative... but adding transparent border seems sufficient
[21:23:06] <coldhead> story of my life
[21:23:08] <tds5016> it's the only reaosn I get anything done. I'm the only person in my group that knows any web dev/js... when I'm stuck I'd be screwed if not for IRc
[21:23:11] <coldhead> oh way to be crankharder
[21:23:13] <coldhead> good job
[21:23:14] <coldhead> ?cc
[21:23:14] <b-ot> coldhead: CASE CLOASED >:|

[21:23:29] <coldhead> thanks bot-chorus
[21:23:37] <coldhead> YOU ARE NUMBER 6 / JUST NEGLECTED BY THESE DAYS
[21:23:49] <crankharder> i dunno man
[21:23:56] <crankharder> your'e still typing pretty coherantly
[21:24:01] <crankharder> you're not winning the drunk battle
[21:24:15] <coldhead> practice
[21:25:17] <tds5016> sounds like time to switch to shots....
[21:29:19] <tds5016> so who is it that I'm waiting for? provided no trainwrecks...
[21:30:45] <coldhead> Cork
[21:30:52] <coldhead> Cork Cork he's our man, if he can't do it etc
[21:31:59] <tw2113> Cork, Cork he's our man, if he can't do it, run for your life
[21:32:30] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016 what is it you are trying to do?  Mobile panels...ugh...jqm
[21:32:52] <tds5016> yeah. trying to get a panel up and running nicely.
[21:34:08] <tds5016> vhttp://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0/docs/widgets/panels/
[21:34:09] <tds5016> that one
[21:34:57] <tds5016> apparently it doens't work thoguh.
[21:36:14] <rael> can you resize jquery ui icons
[21:36:37] <tds5016> LocalPCGuy: any ideas? or just curious?
[21:37:00] <LocalPCGuy> looking at it, but I pretty much hate jqm so not sure if I can help
[21:37:19] <tds5016> yeah, I'm getting there quickly.
[21:37:23] <LocalPCGuy> (hate...did I say that, I meant, avoid.  Hate is such a strong word)
[21:38:07] <LocalPCGuy> been meaning to look at it again, been a little while
[21:39:26] <tds5016> to be honest I really don't know why jquery and jquery mobile are two different things.
[21:39:33] <tfittsy> is there a way to focus on a text input field with jquery mobile?
[21:39:46] <tfittsy> I mean when a page loads
[21:40:09] <tfittsy> a simple $('#search').focus() isn't working
[21:40:35] <tds5016> has #search been added yet?
[21:40:40] <coldhead> $('#search')[0].focus()
[21:41:39] <tfittsy> yeah, I'm trying it in firebug and it still won't work
[21:41:58] <blognewb> hi guys is there a highly recommended site by the jquery community  that offers jquery video tutorials? like drupal's buildamodule.com
[21:41:59] <tfittsy> $('#search').hide() hides it so I think I'm targeting properly.
[21:43:43] <coldhead> hmm, i was sure [0].focus() was the trick
[21:43:47] <coldhead> not working for me either
[21:44:21] <blognewb> Is Joe Marini pretty respected in the jquery community?
[21:44:34] <blognewb> any opinion on his http://www.lynda.com/jQuery-tutorials/essential-training/48370-2.html ?
[21:44:51] <LocalPCGuy> if I recall though, the markup is really kind of important.
[21:45:00] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016
[21:45:18] <tds5016> hey.
[21:45:27] <tds5016> what would the markup be?
[21:45:35] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016 I think you need the data-role, data-position and data-display properties listed on the page you linked
[21:45:47] <LocalPCGuy> and are you including the CSS for jqm?
[21:45:52] <tds5016> I have a feeling I'm doing it wrong :-)
[21:46:11] <tds5016> LocalPCGuy: should be.
[21:46:16] <tds5016> the css should be too.
[21:46:47] <LocalPCGuy> yup, I see the CSS
[21:46:56] <coldhead> sweet quit message
[21:47:04] <tds5016> http://jsfiddle.net/4Qwy4/6/ no luck :-/.
[21:47:15] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016, is the logo supposed to show all the time?
[21:47:22] <tds5016> yeah.
[21:47:29] <tds5016> show and double to hide.
[21:47:37] <tfittsy> coldhead: any other ideas?
[21:47:43] <tds5016> sorry, just toggle.
[21:48:09] <tds5016> tfittsy: try putting it on an onload.
[21:48:45] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016, it actually looks like it is working, just the CSS isn't applied (probably missing jqm specific classes)
[21:49:05] <tds5016> hmm, what classes are they?
[21:49:12] <tds5016> those should've been added.
[21:49:40] <rael> LocalPC: I have setButtons() now, but it flashes first in normal button mode for half a second on load
[21:49:43] <rael> http://jsfiddle.net/r2c2/TRBLf/23/
[21:50:13] <tfittsy> tds5016: it's like focus is broken, even document.getElementById("search").focus(); won't do it.
[21:50:34] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016, ex: http://jsfiddle.net/4Qwy4/7/
[21:50:44] <tds5016> tfittsy: that document.getElement won't retunr a jquery object.
[21:51:12] <tds5016> LocalPCGuy: oh snap.... that looks like it works :-)
[21:51:14] <tfittsy> yeah, but it should still be able to focus on an element
[21:51:18] <LocalPCGuy> :)
[21:51:26] <LocalPCGuy> rael I don't see any flash
[21:51:44] <tds5016> what does the [] do?
[21:52:02] <rael> when you hit Run it does momentarily on firefox
[21:52:54] <coldhead> tfittsy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7936827/input-focus-in-jquery-mobile-but-keyboard-doesnt-appear
[21:52:57] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016, that was just the selector I used, lets me grab the page div without adding an id.  In production you'd probably have an ID or class you could use for a selector instead
[21:53:02] <coldhead> .focus().select() apparently
[21:53:13] <LocalPCGuy> ?selectors @ tds5016
[21:53:14] <bot-t> tds5016, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[21:53:34] <tds5016> LocalPCGuy: I think it's actually needing the page part of it.
[21:53:39] <coldhead> i sure hope Cork is okay
[21:53:43] <coldhead> .seen Cork
[21:53:44] <b-ot> coldhead: I saw Cork 13h 43m ago, here in #jquery, saying: ?.on
[21:53:47] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016, http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[21:54:57] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016, you need to actually build out the page as a jqm application, AFAIK it isn't like UI where each piece is a standalone item
[21:55:45] <tds5016> LocalPCGuy: oh.... I was trying to do this with backbone.
[21:55:48] <tds5016> which is gonna get weird.
[21:57:22] <LocalPCGuy> rael you can get rid of the flash of unstyled buttons a few different ways, one of which is to hide the buttons with CSS and then show them with JS just before you replace them, you could render the entire tree in a div that is positioned off-screen and then once rendered remove the positioning so it is where you want it, couple different things you could do to fix that.  Research FOUC (flash of unstyled content) for ideas
[21:57:44] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016, I kinda figured when I saw <div id="application"></div>
[21:58:05] <tds5016> ;-)
[21:58:06] <brend_> so
[21:58:33] <brend_> what should i change here in order to hide this menu clicking outside the button http://jsfiddle.net/yFFBV/3/
[21:59:17] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016 so...you could either make the backbone templates have the data- stuff you need for the jqm framework to work, or you can reduce your backbone models to components that can be added to smaller portions of the page (content portion, header portion, and so on)
[21:59:25] <coldhead> i keep thinking of Cork's frail broken body, getting so cold by the railroad tracks
[21:59:30] <coldhead> wondering when someone will find him
[21:59:40] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016, and then wrap those portions with the appropriate jqm blocks
[22:00:23] <Mr_Grim> i am trying to fadein div tag styled as a circle after an animation completes but it just causes the animation to jump. any suggestions?
[22:01:46] <tds5016> LocalPCGuy: I'll end up doing the former.
[22:02:17] <LocalPCGuy> tds5016, good call
[22:02:40] <Mr_Grim> using chrome
[22:02:56] <brend_> damn
[22:02:58] <coldhead> Mr_Grim: are you using the completed handler?
[22:03:33] <Mr_Grim> coldhead yeah i think so
[22:03:42] <Mr_Grim> its like a callback you throw in as a param right?
[22:04:26] <Mr_Grim> or is it completeHandler: function().. ?
[22:04:41] <LocalPCGuy> brend_ http://jsfiddle.net/yFFBV/4/
[22:04:57] <coldhead> show us the code, Mr_Grim
[22:05:01] <coldhead> it's the former
[22:05:07] <coldhead> so you're probably doing it right
[22:05:22] <Mr_Grim> sure
[22:05:28] <Mr_Grim> pastebin?
[22:05:39] <coldhead> jsfiddle is preferred
[22:05:40] <LocalPCGuy> brend_, added 2 things - document.body click handler, and stopPropagation on the button click so that it doesn't auto-close the menu right away as soon as the click event bubbles to the body
[22:05:41] <coldhead> see the topic
[22:05:46] <Mr_Grim> ahh i think i know why
[22:05:47] <tfittsy> who do I contact about the focus bug?  I assume it's a bug since .focus() should work from the console.  I tried firing it on the demo page and it didn't work their either.
[22:05:53] <Mr_Grim> one sec
[22:06:13] <Mr_Grim> no never mind
[22:07:02] <brend_> LocalPCGuy:  excellent.. i have changed toggle to hide() cuz is opening the menu when u click outside also
[22:07:18] <LocalPCGuy> brend_, of course
[22:07:30] <Mr_Grim> ill bastepin it anyway
[22:07:34] <brend_> thanks
[22:07:37] <LocalPCGuy> np
[22:08:07] <coldhead> idea for startup: bastepin, a pinterest styled site for basted meats
[22:17:14] <luckyruby> do you guys use the jquery-validation-rails gem or just add it manually for client side validation?
[22:17:21] <luckyruby> oops, wrong channel
[22:17:39] <rael> http://jsfiddle.net/r2c2/vH7ZH/2/   <--- the up down functions don't really work for dynamically added files
[22:18:22] <LocalPCGuy> rael they look to be working for me (Chrome)
[22:18:41] <rael> add a couple files then hit down on Item 1.1 , it skips over both item 2's
[22:18:45] <rael> it jumps 2 down
[22:19:24] <LocalPCGuy> rael hmm...interesting
[22:19:43] <rael> it's the same function , just used on(click
[22:20:02] <rael> same for the static and dynamically added up down's
[22:20:33] <rael> line 21-27
[22:20:38] <rael> are the dynamic ones
[22:21:00] <LocalPCGuy> that code looks really fragile
[22:22:44] <rael> maybe if i use one function for up and one for down
[22:24:09] <LocalPCGuy> rael you are - the click events contain anonymous functions
[22:24:16] <LocalPCGuy> one for up, one for down
[22:26:11] <Mr_Grim> just figured itout
[22:27:29] <coldhead> anything interesting Mr_Grim?
[22:27:33] <rael> localpc: you mean line 21 and 25?
[22:28:15] <LocalPCGuy> rael actually, the click functions for removeListItem, downarrow and uparrow shouldn't be in the click handler funciton for the addFile
[22:28:35] <rael> ok
[22:28:48] <LocalPCGuy> rael like: http://jsfiddle.net/vH7ZH/3/
[22:28:54] <LocalPCGuy> that doesn't solve the issue
[22:29:00] <LocalPCGuy> but is better
[22:29:28] <rael> oh closest() , didn't know that one
[22:29:46] <LocalPCGuy> yah, much better than relying on parent.parent
[22:30:27] <rael> yes i was having to trace the dom in firebug
[22:32:36] <rael> and it does solve the issue with dropping down 2, if i comment out line 62-68, thanks!
[22:33:07] <Mr_Grim> is it possible in js to do something like bindCircleClick = ($('#green_circle').click(function() { ? } and run the function based on the name bindCircleClick ?
[22:35:01] <coldhead> no Mr_Grim, .click() doesn't return a function
[22:35:06] <LocalPCGuy> rael oh, didn't even notice you had the click events listed twice
[22:35:16] <LocalPCGuy> rael yah, that would be the problem :P
[22:36:01] <LocalPCGuy> rael I usually have a initEvents() function in my code and put as many event initializers in that function as possible
[22:36:15] <LocalPCGuy> rael keeps them all together and is easier to find them
[22:36:36] <rael> what would be my initializer events?
[22:36:40] <LocalPCGuy> rael and then I call that from my init (or your doc ready function)
[22:37:46] <LocalPCGuy> rael like this: http://jsfiddle.net/vH7ZH/4/
[22:38:37] <LocalPCGuy> rael I dont know if you noticed, but I am listening for all of the events on the #main div
[22:38:51] <LocalPCGuy> rael so they don't need to be attached multiple times
[22:39:23] <LocalPCGuy> Mr_Grim, you should look into .trigger
[22:39:28] <LocalPCGuy> ?trigger @ Mr_Grim
[22:39:28] <b-ot> Mr_Grim: broadcasting an event out
[22:39:28] <bot-t> Mr_Grim, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[22:39:36] <LocalPCGuy> thank you bot-t
[22:39:37] <bot-t> ;)
[22:39:50] <LocalPCGuy> b-ot that wasn't helpful
[22:40:46] <rael> ?jomama
[22:40:47] <coldhead> Mr_Grim: http://jsfiddle.net/PXUza/
[22:40:48] <bot-t> rael, Couldn't find "jomama" in jQuery Docs.
[22:52:57] <ameen_> is this a jquery irc channel for reals
[22:53:06] <rael> ?closest

[22:55:01] <vinex08> any1 knows a jquery plugin that will smooth my hover effect
[22:55:30] <JesperA> what kind of smoothing?
[22:55:37] <vinex08> all :hover will have a smooth transition
[22:55:43] <JesperA> color, shape, opacity etc?
[22:56:01] <vinex08> just a min let me give you a test case
[22:56:54] <LocalPCGuy> ameen_ for realz it is!
[22:59:10] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/73H83/  <-- can you add a script that will have a smooth transition between black and grey bg
[23:01:41] <JesperA> 1. Why didnt you say that you wanted to make a transition between black and grey in your first question, would have save everyone alot of time and effort. 2. Why do you incist on jquery plugin? Isnt CSS transition enough?
[23:02:06] <vinex08> My englsih isnt that good. that's why
[23:02:35] <vinex08> i didn;t know about CSS transition
[23:02:44] <JesperA> well, you managed to describe your problem the second time so, yeah
[23:04:13] <vinex08> thanks, i learned a new stuff today - css transition
[23:05:39] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[23:06:05] <Cork> warning though transision doesn't work in older browsers
[23:06:07] <Cork> (like ie)
[23:06:33] <Cork> so you will have to have fallback for when transision doens't exist
[23:06:37] <LocalPCGuy> hey Cork isn't dead in a train accident like Coldhead feared
[23:06:53] <Cork> LocalPCGuy: http://www.firstpersontetris.com/
[23:07:14] <ameen_> LocalPCGuy awesome bc I'm going through the jquery chapter of this textbook and it doesn't look pretty
[23:07:35] <JesperA> everything isnt as pretty as me ameen_
[23:12:18] <coldhead> oh thank god you're okay Cork
[23:12:28] <coldhead> someone said you'd been horribly killed
[23:12:31] <Cork> ...
[23:17:31] <yogurt_truck> coldhead doesn't have a hot head. that's all i'm gonna say.
[23:18:07] <tw2113> it's all in the brandname
[23:53:49] <Dibo> Hello
[23:54:00] <JesperA> olleH
[23:55:23] <Braden`> Hello
[23:55:41] <Braden`> I am (oddly enough) having a hard time finding the documentation for .done.  Is that the same as deferred.done()?
[23:55:49] <Braden`> Or are there multiple .done()s?
