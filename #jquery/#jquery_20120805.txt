[01:47:29] <skamikaze> o/
[01:54:51] <StPiere> i render a table in the page with ~ 5000-6000 tousand rows ... i need to add events, and so on , but it seems to struggle jquery ... any idea whats the best way to handle this ?
[02:00:58] <coldhead> StPiere: you should be using .on() for your events
[02:01:11] <coldhead> if you do that sensibly it should be pretty efficient
[02:02:52] <StPiere> coldhead, you mean pure javascript's on() , no jquery event handling ?
[02:25:49] <sahbeewah> you render a table with 6000 rows? what's the point of that
[02:26:07] <sahbeewah> nobody can see that many rows on a page
[02:30:06] <Guest46420> hi
[02:30:41] <Guest46420> I have a question regarding the bbq library
[02:32:25] <Guest46420> how does this work?
[02:54:12] <coldhead> StPiere: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:54:14] <Kriz1> can anyone see any errors in this small chunk of code?
[02:54:15] <Kriz1> http://pastebin.com/zUkADws8
[02:54:32] <Kriz1> basically linkTitle is always null, even when i type into the input field for it
[02:56:02] <Kriz1> do you think it being inside a live() call would be causing an issue?
[02:57:35] <Kriz1> but it doesnt say undefined, so it must be finding the field :S
[02:57:58] <coldhead> what does $('input#editTitle').val(); return when you run it from the console
[02:58:04] <coldhead> or $('input#editTitle') for that matter
[02:58:51] <Kriz1> it returns it twice
[02:58:52] <Kriz1> ohhhhh
[02:58:54] <Kriz1> your clever!
[02:59:04] <Kriz1> im guessing jquery freaks out if there are 2 fields with the same id?
[02:59:31] <Kriz1> i had it in a div, then copied the contents of that into a lightbox, so it must be finding both the new and the old one and crapping its pants
[03:00:21] <coldhead> web browsers freak out when you have a duplicate ID
[03:00:23] <coldhead> they must be unique
[03:01:02] <Kriz1> yay it works now
[03:01:04] <Kriz1> thanks heaps for that!
[03:01:13] <Kriz1> i just made it .empty the div once its copied it over
[03:06:23] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/admin/staticpage/FE_homepage/edit
[03:06:34] <Parhs> hello guys any idea why this when you click upload files
[03:06:38] <Parhs> doesnt work in opera ?
[03:06:57] <Parhs> admin adminpass
[03:11:33] <LSshock> hi all, i cant seem to figure out how to get a callback working with my code, i need it to run something AFTER all the each() are done doing their thing. http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/DKGRs/ thanks
[03:12:48] <johnkpaul> .each isn't async, you should just put it at the end of that block
[03:13:00] <johnkpaul> LSshock: http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/DKGRs/1/
[03:13:55] <LSshock> i had that, but it makes it run before it ever finishes the each() checks
[03:14:06] <LSshock> thus submitting before its even done checking the form
[03:15:14] <LSshock> this isnt clear is it
[03:15:19] <LSshock> hmpf
[03:15:33] <johnkpaul> LSshock: are you sure that it jus wasn't done animating?
[03:17:21] <johnkpaul> LSshock: http://jsfiddle.net/johnkpaul/DKGRs/2/
[03:17:30] <johnkpaul> if you want to wait for all of the animations to comlete
[03:17:35] <johnkpaul> complete*
[03:17:42] <LSshock> let me try that in the site
[03:18:00] <johnkpaul> that's using the fact that animations implement the deferred interface
[03:18:03] <johnkpaul> LSshock: don't copy and pase that
[03:18:08] <johnkpaul> paste*
[03:18:14] <johnkpaul> I didn't really make it work, just showed you the idea
[03:18:20] <LSshock> o lol
[03:18:43] <LSshock> but perhaps theres a flaw in my code, the problem im having is that sometimes i got to click twice for it to validate then send the form
[03:18:47] <johnkpaul> I only changed your first two .each's and I didn't care about syntax errors
[03:19:01] <LSshock> while sometimes it works with one click, so i thought maybe if it checked at the very end it would solve the problem
[03:19:28] <johnkpaul> oh, LSshock, I don't know, I thought this was a problem about waiting until the animations were complete before submitting your form
[03:20:35] <LSshock> your are kinda right
[03:20:42] <LSshock> i removed them out of the animate but i forgot the first one
[03:21:00] <LSshock> you gotta know i'v been messing with this for literally for hours and i just cant see straight i guess :/
[03:22:02] <LSshock> im cleaning it up
[03:22:07] <johnkpaul> LSshock: yeah, that happens sometimes, might be worth a breather and step away
[03:22:18] <LSshock> yeah :(
[03:22:33] <LSshock> but darn i just want this thing to work so i tell myself to keep trying but this proves it just messes things up more
[03:23:47] <LSshock> phew cleaning up that animate fixed it
[03:23:55] <LSshock> so thanks to you john
[03:23:59] <LSshock> for see that before i did
[03:24:07] <johnkpaul> :) no problem LSshock, I'm glad it worked out
[03:57:10] <opalepatrick> what can I use to identify when a select option is physically chosen. $('.acno').change seems to activate also on page load?
[03:59:52] <ivankuzev> opalepatrick: thats the way i do it ..it shoud not go off in page load.
[04:01:15] <opalepatrick> thanks ivankuzev, then something else must be going pear shaped.
[04:02:00] <BinaryKitten> opalepatrick are you calling .change() by chance?
[04:03:53] <opalepatrick> BinaryKitten, I am doing ($('.acno').change ? $('.acno :selected').val() : "alternative value") - on a page load I want the alternative
[04:04:26] <ivankuzev> thats wrong..........i think
[04:04:56] <BinaryKitten> yep
[04:05:10] <ivankuzev> $('.acno').change() this fires up the change event and messes up your code
[04:05:30] <opalepatrick> ahaa
[04:05:43] <BinaryKitten> can you pastebin your code and we can suggest the fix
[04:06:16] <ivankuzev> what are you actually testing for?....that line doesnt make sense to me
[04:07:14] <opalepatrick> tbh I am not getting this correct in my head anyway, you are right ivankuzev, it doesnt make sense. Let me think about this properly before wasting everyones time
[04:08:56] <ishi> hello :)
[04:10:18] <ishi> let's say I have several scripts that want to 'do something' on document ready...  If I just do $(function() { ... }) in each of them, only the last one is used
[04:11:46] <ivankuzev> 1.possible sollution is make a document ready handler that calls all the scrips in the order you want
[04:12:13] <BinaryKitten> ishi are you sure
[04:12:22] <BinaryKitten> because that's not what's supposed to happen
[04:12:47] <ishi> hmm... no, I'm not :)
[04:13:03] <ishi> it seems to me this way, but perhaps I'm wrong...
[04:13:13] <ishi> ok, *if* it works, I don't understand how :)
[04:13:22] <BinaryKitten> try 1 at a time
[04:13:29] <ishi> :)
[04:13:36] <BinaryKitten> see if the 1 works
[04:13:39] <BinaryKitten> then add the next
[04:13:45] <BinaryKitten> if that works too .. etc
[04:13:51] <ivankuzev> yeah ..as far as i know $(document).ready(function(){}) it just ADDS a function as handler...not replaces
[04:14:12] <BinaryKitten> if the one you add doesn't there could be a problem in that script which prevents other parts running
[04:14:29] <johnkpaul> ivankuzev: yes, you are correct
[04:14:46] <johnkpaul> jquery maintians a list of handlers
[04:15:00] <BinaryKitten> ishi also, you can completely remove the need for document ready by moving your scripts to just before </body>
[04:15:05] <Cameron_> i want to allow my users to download a csv report based on data they have generated and it's in the form of json. i had it working by putting a hidden ifame on the page that directs the to a php page with a GET request where the report is processed but the serialized json means the URL is too long, how can i do the same with a POST request?
[04:15:18] <BinaryKitten> this will also give your site a small boost of percieved performance too
[04:15:18] <Cameron_> basically, how do i post data to an embeded iframe?
[04:15:30] <BinaryKitten> Cameron_ via a form?
[04:15:33] <johnkpaul> ?g form target frame mdn @ Cameron_
[04:15:34] <b-ot> Cameron_, form.target - MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/form.target
[04:15:47] <Cameron_> so i can just submit it, even though it's in an iframe?
[04:15:56] <BinaryKitten> ?
[04:16:06] <BinaryKitten> if it's in an iframe and its a form
[04:16:12] <BinaryKitten> what would you expect to happen?
[04:16:16] <Cameron_> lol
[04:16:28] <Cameron_> idk
[04:16:35] <Cameron_> i just thought there might be problems
[04:16:37] <BinaryKitten> you can't trigger events in iframes, or listen for them
[04:16:42] <Cameron_> what
[04:16:46] <Cameron_> thats what im asking
[04:16:59] <BinaryKitten> so you can't trigger the form's submit inside an iframe from a script outside the iframe
[04:17:03] <ishi> BinaryKitten: is it 'the' solution?  I mean... is it how it should be done? (moving scripts to the very bottom, I mean).  I'm ok with that... I just thought the scripts should be in the head :).
[04:17:09] <Cameron_> thats what i want to do BinaryKitten
[04:17:21] <BinaryKitten> ishi yeah, it's recommended
[04:17:26] <johnkpaul> BinaryKitten: that's not completely true, if it's on the same domain, you _can_ do that
[04:17:30] <johnkpaul> but Cameron_are you sure that's what you want to do
[04:17:41] <johnkpaul> why are you using this iframe hack anyway, any reason you can't use plain old XHR?
[04:17:44] <ishi> BinaryKitten: thanks :)
[04:17:55] <Cameron_> johnkpaul, how else can i download files with ajax?
[04:18:01] <BinaryKitten> johnkpaul it's easier to air on the side of not going to work, than to go round it
[04:18:07] <ivankuzev> ishi:it will work..probably but you better use $(document).ready
[04:18:15] <BinaryKitten> ivankuzev no
[04:18:24] <BinaryKitten> don't need document ready
[04:18:29] <johnkpaul> Cameron_: eh, depends on what browsers you need
[04:18:30] <Cameron_> johnkpaul, i googled it and apparently this is the only solution
[04:18:37] <Cameron_> just chrome and firefox
[04:18:40] <johnkpaul> Cameron_: if you need IE, yes this is the only solution
[04:18:41] <BinaryKitten> if the scripts are at the end, the document is already ready by that point
[04:18:51] <johnkpaul> oh, chrome and FF support the anchor download attribute
[04:19:05] <johnkpaul> and I think you can force a File object to be donloaded
[04:19:13] <Cameron_> ooooh
[04:19:16] <ivankuzev> binarykitten:yeah but you may have some problems with multiple scripts there
[04:19:17] <Cameron_> awesome, thanks :)
[04:19:25] <BinaryKitten> ivankuzev how and why?
[04:19:26] <Cameron_> but wait
[04:19:36] <Cameron_> johnkpaul, how i can i generate the file and then download it?
[04:20:04] <Cameron_> nevermind
[04:20:06] <Cameron_> i think i got it
[04:20:21] <ivankuzev> binarykitten if they are external they are loaded after the document finished(but before $(document).ready())
[04:20:44] <johnkpaul> Cameron_: ok, let me know, I haven't looked up the filesystem api docs in a while, so I don't know them off the top of my head
[04:20:44] <BinaryKitten> urm?
[04:20:55] <BinaryKitten> ivankuzev not seeing the problem still
[04:21:37] <BinaryKitten> script tags are synchronous, not asynchronous ivankuzev. All scripts are blocking processes until their load and parse
[04:22:09] <BinaryKitten> so yes, there would be an issue if you place your code script before jquery's .. but you would anywhere
[04:22:23] <johnkpaul> Cameron_: here's an example
[04:22:24] <johnkpaul> http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/a.download.html
[04:22:37] <BinaryKitten> ivankuzev i'm still not seeing how it would have problems with multiple scripts
[04:22:45] <Cameron_> yeah i saw that :D
[04:22:46] <johnkpaul> :D makes me very happy that we're able to do this in the future and not the horrible hacks with content disposition
[04:23:30] <ivankuzev> <BinaryKitten>:okay..didnt think of that.
[04:24:19] <BinaryKitten> ivankuzev no worries :)
[04:25:04] <ivankuzev> see you in a bit. got to restart the pc
[04:25:52] * BinaryKitten departs for the local makerspace
[04:32:11] <Parhs> hello guys
[04:32:26] <Parhs> is there anything ready made to show as popup html ?
[04:33:59] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery ui dialog @ Parhs
[04:34:00] <b-ot> Parhs, jQuery UI - Dialog Demos & Documentation â†’ http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[04:41:22] <Parhs> hm still this doesnt work with opera fine
[04:44:34] * ivankuzev is back
[04:45:27] <batdorf> If I want to sell my jQuery plugin with either a 1) single use license, or 2) a multi-use (developer's) license, does anyone know which licenses are out there that I could use?
[04:46:28] <jkarsrud> batdorf: maybe the apache license?
[04:47:08] <jkarsrud> But how will you make sure no one just rips the plugin from a site that uses it?
[04:47:23] <johnkpaul> batdorf: just take a look at the license for isotope, I think they have similar terms
[04:47:49] <batdorf> thanks, i'll check both out
[04:48:10] <batdorf> jkarsrud: of course it wont be pirate proof
[04:48:17] <batdorf> but i wont include a live demo
[04:48:20] <jkarsrud> batdorf: I'm only asking because it's an interesting idea :)
[04:48:27] <jkarsrud> okay =)
[04:48:37] <jkarsrud> so a donate button isn't enough? :)
[04:48:38] <johnkpaul> jkarsrud: there are many jquery plugins that have commercial versions, it's not _that_ uncommon
[04:48:48] <jkarsrud> johnkpaul: no ofcourse not, I know that
[04:49:11] <batdorf> ill have a free version too
[04:49:28] <jkarsrud> I just find the _how_ interesting
[04:49:41] <johnkpaul> jkarsrud: ah I see, yeah, I agree, it's interesting legal mechanics
[04:50:00] <johnkpaul> gratefully, none of them are really expensive enough to cause any problem getting a commercial license when you're working for a company
[04:50:30] <jkarsrud> nope, and multi-site licenses are often an option too, so it's not really a big problem :)
[04:50:50] <batdorf> i hope mine sells!
[04:50:51] <batdorf> ha ha
[04:50:59] <johnkpaul> :) what is your plugin?
[04:51:45] <batdorf> im going to sell a responsive version of this alongside: http://kevinbatdorf.github.com/codaslider/
[04:52:20] <batdorf> the only difference will be that it's responsive and adaptable to screen sizes
[04:53:14] <batdorf> the isotope license looks good, I'll just copy and edit that one...
[04:53:27] <johnkpaul> batdorf: great
[04:54:42] <batdorf> yeah, i guess wish me luck ha ha
[04:55:06] <batdorf> i dont know of any responsive content sliders out there, except for images
[04:55:25] <johnkpaul> :) good luck!
[04:55:41] <johnkpaul> I didn't read through your blog post, so i don't really know what a responsive content slider is
[04:55:43] <BinaryKitten> batdorf
[04:55:52] <johnkpaul> it's a carousel that works with media queries?
[04:56:13] <BinaryKitten> on your installation slide change  $().ready(function()  to $(function()   or $(document).ready(function()
[04:56:27] <BinaryKitten> $() is considered bad practice
[04:56:39] <BinaryKitten> * $().ready is considered bad practice
[04:56:42] <batdorf> a content slider that will adjust to varying screen sizes... so if you load it on your phone, it will not extend past the edges of the screen
[04:56:51] <batdorf> BinaryKitten: really?
[04:56:55] <BinaryKitten> yep
[04:57:17] <batdorf> which is the best practice of the two you listed?
[04:57:46] <BinaryKitten> the 1st $(function()
[04:57:59] <batdorf> thanks :)
[04:58:14] <BinaryKitten> also, can you change the wording of "placed within the <head></head>" to "placed after the jQuery script"
[04:58:37] <batdorf> I can
[04:58:44] <johnkpaul> batdorf: are you looking for comments about your plugin? :) If so, I have some that might help you
[04:58:57] <batdorf> always
[04:59:38] <johnkpaul> so since you're going to charge for it, I'd try to make it cleaner, and perhaps add unit tests to it
[04:59:55] <johnkpaul> I avoid paying for anything that I can't easily understand and modify, as much as possible
[05:00:24] <johnkpaul> when I look at your plugin code, I look for unit tests and am dissapointed that they aren't there
[05:00:40] <johnkpaul> it depends on your audience I suppose, but more and more javascript developers are finding the necessity of a good testing suiete
[05:00:43] <johnkpaul> suite*
[05:00:57] <batdorf> ive read about unit tests, but its something id have to really read up on
[05:01:09] <johnkpaul> even tests aside, you have some very large functions that are hard to grok quickly
[05:01:10] <batdorf> jasmine?
[05:01:18] <johnkpaul> jasmine is a testing library
[05:01:22] <BinaryKitten> johnkpaul agreed. also batdorf try running through http://www.jslint.com/
[05:01:26] <johnkpaul> of the behavior drivin development flavor
[05:01:38] <johnkpaul> damn, can't type today...driven*
[05:01:43] <batdorf> jslint is fine. i use the lint plugin for sublime text
[05:01:59] <johnkpaul> yes but batdorf, you don't publicaly give your settings
[05:02:05] <johnkpaul> so when I try to lint it, it won't work
[05:02:19] <batdorf> you lost me
[05:02:20] <BinaryKitten> i linted the code and got more errors that it wanted to show
[05:02:27] <johnkpaul> there are many build tools out there to make things like this easier, grunt is currently the most popular
[05:02:27] <batdorf> oh wow
[05:02:37] <johnkpaul> batdorf: your submile text makes assumptions about your linting options
[05:02:51] <johnkpaul> you didn't share them in the file, or in some configuration, so when BinaryKitten lints it, it all breaks
[05:03:28] <BinaryKitten> (or anyone ... not just me)
[05:03:30] <johnkpaul> I think i would be worthwhile for you to look into how popular open source tools build and distribute their code
[05:03:40] <johnkpaul> yes, me too, but I didn't try :)
[05:04:09] <batdorf> interesting
[05:04:16] <batdorf> i have to admit im pretty new at all of this
[05:04:31] <johnkpaul> batdorf: this might be a good example for you https://github.com/johnkpaul/jquery-ajax-retry
[05:04:32] <BinaryKitten> :)
[05:04:39] <batdorf> i just read a few books on javascript and jquery and went to work
[05:04:48] <johnkpaul> not that it's at all popular, or even used on anything but my sites, but you can clone that repo, and then run grunt lint
[05:04:49] <BinaryKitten> batdorf: also line 20 is going to cause a big headache
[05:04:56] <jita> I have a array of subjects stored in variable subjects. So i want to convert that array into a markup. Here is the example of array: var subjects=['foo', 'bar', 'baz']. So i want to convert this into "<a href='/subjects/foo'>Foo</a>, <a href='/subjects/bar/>Bar<a>, <a href='/subjects/baz'>Baz</a> "
[05:05:06] <johnkpaul> and you can see that it all lints perfectly, and then you can run grunt qunit, and you can see that all of my unit tests pass
[05:05:21] <BinaryKitten> since slider.init is called every time i use it the slider on an element
[05:05:22] <johnkpaul> ?$.map @jita
[05:05:29] <johnkpaul> ?.map @jita
[05:05:37] <johnkpaul> ?map @ jita
[05:05:41] <johnkpaul> :) come on bot
[05:05:45] <BinaryKitten> bot-t is dead
[05:05:55] <jita> johnkpaul, i will google, thanks
[05:06:00] <johnkpaul> he, it comes back to life every once in a while
[05:06:02] <johnkpaul> jita: np
[05:06:57] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[05:07:07] <BinaryKitten> batdorf can i only run 1 slider on a page@?
[05:07:20] <batdorf> multiple
[05:07:31] <batdorf> the demo page has about 4-5
[05:07:34] <BinaryKitten> but they all share the same settings
[05:07:39] <batdorf> no
[05:08:09] <batdorf> you can set individual settings for each
[05:08:14] <BinaryKitten> ah
[05:08:26] <batdorf> you can even nest the sliders and it wont break (with one small exception)
[05:08:27] <BinaryKitten> prototype switch trick
[05:08:30] <BinaryKitten> missed that
[05:09:34] <fatAgnes> hi
[05:09:49] <BinaryKitten> ok now i'm gone
[05:09:57] <batdorf> thanks BinaryKitten
[05:10:12] <BinaryKitten> batdorf np
[05:10:12] <batdorf> and thanks johnkpaul
[05:10:28] <johnkpaul> no problem batdorf
[05:10:34] <BinaryKitten> there are a few things in there i can learn too :)
[05:10:36] <johnkpaul> good luck with everything, I'd love to hear how it goes
[05:12:44] <jita> johnkpaul, so i convert map each name in a array into a anchor tag?
[05:13:17] <shoky> batdorf: cache your jquery objects, don't do so many repetitive selections..
[05:13:29] <johnkpaul> jita: $.map(array function(key, value){return $("<a>"+value+</a>");})
[05:13:49] <batdorf> shoky: i thought i did cache anything I used more than once
[05:13:56] <shoky> batdorf: also $($(self.sliderId).parent())  is superfluous .  change that to $(self.sliderId).parent()
[05:14:28] <shoky> batdorf: huh you have tons of repetitive selections.. for example in 'addArrows' you're doing the same selection 5 times
[05:14:30] <jita> johnkpaul, thanks again
[05:14:30] <johnkpaul> :D batdorf should add shoky and BinaryKitten as editors
[05:14:32] <batdorf> shoky: i get errors when i change that
[05:14:36] <johnkpaul> jita: no problem
[05:14:42] <shoky> batdorf: then fix them :)
[05:14:56] <batdorf> the errors as in it doesnt work ;-)
[05:15:12] <batdorf> its proabbly something beyond my level ha ha
[05:15:21] <shoky> you definitely don't need $($(self.sliderId).parent())
[05:15:54] <batdorf> $(self.sliderId) is cached, right?
[05:15:58] <shoky> no
[05:16:04] <shoky> var jq = $(self.sliderId);
[05:16:05] <shoky> is cached
[05:16:43] <batdorf> but even though I have, var self = this;
[05:16:52] <batdorf> ?
[05:16:53] <shoky> that's not a selection
[05:17:02] <shoky> $(selector) <-- that is a selection
[05:17:06] <Cameron_> johnkpaul, it worked btw, it's really cool actually :)
[05:17:14] <johnkpaul> :D awesome Cameron_
[05:17:29] <johnkpaul> I agree, it's one of the most useful things in the html5 spec
[05:17:49] <Cameron_> thanks!! :D
[05:17:51] <Cameron_> yeah
[05:18:00] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun!
[05:18:14] <batdorf> its my understanding that if I cache this, I can refer to it's settings without any hit on performance
[05:18:55] <shoky> refer to its settings? dont know about that. but calling $(self.sliderId) repetitively does a selection each time
[05:18:56] <johnkpaul> batdorf: yes, "hit on peformance" === "query on the dom"
[05:19:19] <shoky> selection===querying the dom   yes
[05:19:37] <batdorf> yeah, i thought it was not querying the dom in this case, since this is cached
[05:19:52] <batdorf> it's selecting from the cached object
[05:20:02] <shoky> self.sliderId is just a string
[05:20:16] <jita> Is this valid? $('<p>", ".join(subjects)</p>')
[05:20:49] <batdorf> so its going into the dom every time?
[05:20:55] <shoky> batdorf: yes
[05:20:58] <johnkpaul> jita: what do you mean valid?
[05:21:03] <batdorf> i guess that makes sense
[05:21:06] <johnkpaul> It is a valid js statment, but I don't think that's what you want to do
[05:21:26] <batdorf> ok ill cache it better
[05:21:32] <johnkpaul> jita: I think you want... $('<p>' + ", ".join(subjects) + '</p>');
[05:21:56] <jita> johnkpaul, yes exactly :) Thanks for the correction
[05:22:25] <batdorf> thanks shoky
[05:22:29] <johnkpaul> jita: no problem
[05:24:02] <shoky> though, is there really any reason to view $('#someId') as "querying the dom"
[05:24:15] <shoky> it's just one quick lookup through a hashtable
[05:24:25] <shoky> jkp, thoughts? :)
[05:24:31] <batdorf> I'll add something like this toward the beginning of the build function self.$sliderId = $(self.sliderId);
[05:25:14] <shoky> batdorf: thats better ya, but the name is kinda off, it's not an Id anymore :P
[05:25:27] <johnkpaul> shoky: what do you mean lookup through a hashtable?
[05:25:34] <johnkpaul> you mean in terms of what browsers optimize?
[05:25:40] <shoky> johnkpaul: yeah
[05:25:56] <johnkpaul> you're correct that getting elements by id is faster, but it's still much slower than staying only in the js runtime
[05:25:56] <shoky> i dont think there's ever any doubt that document.getElementById  is constant time
[05:26:01] <shoky> really?
[05:26:21] <shoky> hmm
[05:26:29] <johnkpaul> shoky: no dom query is definitely faster than 1 dom query, even if that dom query is fast
[05:26:30] <shoky> maybe in IE8 or something, no?
[05:26:34] <johnkpaul> if you already have a refernece to it
[05:26:45] <shoky> yeah but you're calling it a dom query
[05:26:54] <shoky> but its just one constant time hashtable lookup
[05:26:54] <johnkpaul> it is a dom query
[05:27:03] <shoky> it doesnt look through children nodes of any element
[05:27:04] <johnkpaul> I don't think that's alwyas the case shoky
[05:27:11] <johnkpaul> you'r emaking the assumption that it can be cached indefinitey
[05:27:18] <johnkpaul> you can change the ids of an element
[05:27:24] <johnkpaul> and you can assign an element an id that used to be on another
[05:27:28] <shoky> and the browser changes its hashtable
[05:27:42] <shoky> and it'd still be a constant time lookup, no?
[05:27:43] <johnkpaul> sans any jsperf, I don't really know if it's a marginal difference, but I think the best practice for caching jquery selectors still stands
[05:27:50] <johnkpaul> shoky: I don't know, need to ask someone on the chrome dev team
[05:27:59] <shoky> oks
[05:28:04] <shoky> thnx for input ;)
[05:28:53] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[05:29:27] <batdorf> so should i leave it alone or change it? ;-)
[05:29:41] <shoky> of course, caching is best either way cause you still avoid the hashtable lookup ;p
[05:30:01] <shoky> bard: cache :P
[05:30:11] <shoky> batdorf ^
[05:30:14] <shoky> sorry bard
[05:30:15] <johnkpaul> batdorf: cache, always
[05:30:22] <johnkpaul> shoky: http://jsperf.com/jquery-sharp-vs-getelementbyid/8, not eactly what we want, but intersting
[05:30:25] <batdorf> ok
[05:31:22] <johnkpaul> shoky: http://jsperf.com/cached-vs-getelementbyid/4
[05:31:37] <johnkpaul> getElementById is still way way way slower than memoizing it
[05:31:50] <johnkpaul> even though it's probably faster than querySelector for a complex expression
[05:32:27] <bailus> the dom is evil
[05:32:29] <jkarsrud> yeah, I think sizzle outperforms qSA in some cases
[05:32:30] <bailus> avoid it at all costs
[05:34:12] <shoky> it shouldn't be!
[05:34:34] <shoky> document.getElementById should just as quick as myMap['someProperty']  :(
[05:34:47] <johnkpaul> :D but shoky, it's not as static as you think, in a real hashmap, the vlaues don't change
[05:34:56] <shoky> why not?
[05:35:18] <johnkpaul> because that's not how hashmaps work, they take references
[05:35:43] <johnkpaul> well, I'm talking out of my ass, I don't know enough really about how browsers work
[05:35:51] <shoky> i can map some key to one value and then map them to another
[05:36:00] <johnkpaul> right, but that value doesn't change on the fly
[05:36:13] <shoky> just like... myMap['id1'] = someElement;  myMap['id1'] = someOtherElement;
[05:36:24] <bailus> im pretty sure browsers are based on some sort of dark magic
[05:36:55] <johnkpaul> shoky: yeah, but that's an explicit set of the hashmap, when I change the id of an element, who knows if that happens
[05:37:15] <johnkpaul> this is a very interesting question though, I want to look into it further
[05:37:21] <shoky> well i'm not saying that modifications to the DOM are quick
[05:37:29] <shoky> but lookups for a speicifc ID should be
[05:37:33] <Jayflux> didn't even know querySelectorAll existed
[05:37:33] <johnkpaul> I checked out the code to chromium a long time ago and never read a line of the code
[05:37:40] <shoky> heh me too :D
[05:37:50] <shoky> well i read some lines
[05:37:51] <shoky> :P
[05:37:55] <fatAgnes> guys I need to convert this to a histogram [5.06,4.64,4.98,4.57,4.82,4.76,4.68,4.49,4.83,4.47]
[05:38:01] <fatAgnes> how would I do it?
[05:38:07] <bailus> i know chrome stores tables of ids and classes and such
[05:38:16] <bailus> for fast css rendering
[05:38:32] <jkarsrud> Jayflux: well, it's still slower that using the good old dom functions, so; http://jsperf.com/queryselectorall-vs-getelementsbytagname/34
[05:38:52] <jkarsrud> bailus: yeah, chrome/webkit does some smart stuff
[05:39:00] <Jayflux> jkarsrud smaller is faster?
[05:39:01] <jkarsrud> and v8 is insane
[05:39:09] <shoky> welp i guess there is just stuff i'm  not thinking about that goes into it
[05:39:19] <jkarsrud> Jayflux: nope, higher is better. The more it can handle the better
[05:39:19] <shoky> i trust chrome devs to usually do the right thing ;p
[05:39:53] <johnkpaul> shoky: you know, they say cache invalidation is one of the hardest things to do :)
[05:40:08] <bailus> fatAgnes: excel
[05:40:21] <Jayflux> jkarsrud ahh, why is queryselectorall so much slower then?
[05:40:47] <fatAgnes> looking for a js library that can create a histogram or scatterplot out of this: [5.06,4.64,4.98,4.57,4.82,4.76,4.68,4.49,4.83,4.47]
[05:40:54] <fatAgnes> (for example)
[05:41:00] <johnkpaul> ?g google charting library @ fatAgnes
[05:41:08] <bot-t> fatAgnes, Google Chart Tools — Google Developers - https://developers.google.com/chart/
[05:41:21] <jkarsrud> Jayflux: because it's pretty new compared to get elementsbytagname etc, so they probably haven't been performance tested
[05:41:24] <jkarsrud> as much
[05:41:32] <chachan> jkarsrud, http://goo.gl/z1nDE that might help you
[05:41:33] <jkarsrud> or something, I don't know, I don't work on v8 :P
[05:41:47] <chachan> jkarsrud, that wasn't for you. Sorry
[05:41:51] <jkarsrud> np :)
[05:41:56] <chachan> fatAgnes, http://goo.gl/z1nDE that might help you
[05:42:39] <jkarsrud> Jayflux and shoky; which is why sizzle is faster than qSA in some cases, because it actually uses getelementbyid/getelementsbytagname etc instead of qSA
[05:42:53] <Jayflux> I see
[05:43:01] <jkarsrud> but I think qSA might be faster than sizzle in more complex "queries"
[05:43:16] <jkarsrud> ehm, selectors ofc, not queries
[05:43:27] <Jayflux> jkarsrud im guessing its something that will get faster over time
[05:43:42] <jkarsrud> yeah, I think they will
[05:44:09] <ishi> :)
[05:44:14] <ishi> It's me again :)
[05:44:20] <jkarsrud> but not right now, as we still have the better and faster dom methods for simple selectors like tagname and id
[05:44:21] <ishi> now ajax question :)
[05:44:45] <jkarsrud> anyway, bbs, gotta clean the apartment a bit :P
[05:45:36] <ishi> when I do $.get(...), and server decides that it's an unauthorised user, I'm getting 403, which the jquery follows and returns as a 'result' login form...
[05:46:01] <shoky> jkarsrud: yes when I was talking about $('#someId') i was assuming getElementById
[05:46:03] <ishi> I kind of expected to get the .error() method fired at this point (instead of this redirection following)
[05:46:41] <ishi> is there a way to stop jquery from doing this?
[05:49:31] <jita> Can anyone please tell me why i am getting syntax error in this http://dpaste.org/GO2zQ/ ?
[05:50:44] <DanielRH> Hi, i could really use some help, id be very very grateful :)
[05:50:55] <DanielRH> Anyone know jquery mobile well?
[05:50:57] <spanglesontoast> for the term of realtime posts/messages what is the term am I looking for ?
[05:52:04] <DanielRH> Erm ajax? could be wrong, new to this...
[05:55:10] <spanglesontoast> DanielRH: well like realtime stuff want to make an inbox the right way
[05:58:08] <shoky> jita: you have a newline in your html string
[05:58:50] <jita> shoky, it says you have unclosed string
[05:59:10] <shoky> jita: indeed
[05:59:23] <Drager> Is there any plugin that allow users to move a div all over the page and put it on a place they want? And then have it ther?
[05:59:32] <shoky> jita: you have a newline inside your string, just before <div class="clr">
[06:00:52] <shoky> jita: also i think you mean  subject_links.join(", ")  instead of ", ".join(subject_links)
[06:01:36] <jita> shoky, i cant find any new line, i even made all that into a one link string, still not working
[06:01:39] <shoky> Drager: jQuery UI lets you do that with 'draggable'
[06:02:03] <jita> shoky, i think it worked
[06:02:05] <shoky> jita: in your paste, there is a newline right before the end of your string:  <div class="clr"></div></div><div class="clr"></div>
[06:02:25] <Drager> shoky: Thanks looks like something that I want but the place wont be saved?
[06:02:58] <shoky> Drager: you can have it stay where you dragged it to, ya..
[06:03:12] <Drager> shoky: If I refresh the page?
[06:03:22] <shoky> Drager: that's something else..
[06:04:27] <shoky> Drager: you'd need to save the location somewhere. could be cookies/localstorage, could be on a serverside session or in the DB. up to you :P
[06:04:36] <DanielRH> Anyone know jquerymobile somewhat well?
[06:04:50] <Drager> shoky: Yeah alright. thank you
[06:05:50] <jita> shoky, thanks
[06:06:19] <Roundaround> hey all
[06:06:26] <DanielRH> Something weird is going on... cant figure it out. With this div -  <div data-role="content" style="padding: 15px"> it looks good but does not do anything when you click submit on the form and without that div it works but looks horrible
[06:06:47] <DanielRH> Using jquerymobile, heres my code http://pastebin.com/mPA4JFb3
[06:07:24] <DanielRH> Would LOVE some help if anyone has any idea about whats going wrong :)
[06:07:46] <Roundaround> I would love to help, but I've never used mobile yet
[06:08:30] <shoky> DanielRH: i dont know jqmobile either, but mm how are you handling the form submit?
[06:08:44] <shoky> DanielRH: i mean, do you have a submit handler in your js code?
[06:08:52] <DanielRH> simple action="file.php" no ajax, nothing fancy
[06:08:56] <shoky> oh dang
[06:09:07] <shoky> i totally missed that action="build-submit.php"
[06:09:10] <shoky> sorry :P
[06:10:43] <DanielRH> ah, happened to me a min ago with the data-ajax="false", it suddenly disapeared and i thought AHA! thats what did it... then it was right in front of my nose :( lol :P
[06:10:58] <shoky> ;]
[06:11:44] <DanielRH> Hate these type of problems, it always turns out to be a missed end tag or something like that... a semi colon in the js gah, ok back to code diving
[06:13:13] <CodesStuff1> I really don't know how people can code in a language whos syntax doesn't use semi-colons to signify the end of an instruction
[06:13:24] <CodesStuff1> ie: python
[06:13:30] <K3|Chris> CodesStuff1: doesn't most?
[06:13:37] <Roundaround> Me neither, CodesStuff1
[06:13:38] <CodesStuff1> I mean, Python is all good and well, but I hate the whitespace >=[
[06:13:45] <K3|Chris> and it makes a kind of sense, you just have to get used to it
[06:14:23] <DanielRH> haha :P its not that bad, the time saved using python makes up for having to push a few more buttons i think
[06:14:34] <CodesStuff1> Yeah. I've been messing around with GAE for a small section of my webapp (encryption string generation that has to be private), and it gets annoying.
[06:14:46] <CodesStuff1> That, and Python's error reporting for bad syntax is terrible.
[06:14:56] <shoky> no need for any semicolons in lispy languages :P
[06:15:01] <Roundaround> I'm forced to program in VB amd occasionally python for work and I don't particularly enjoy it
[06:15:03] <shoky> nor any newlines :D
[06:15:06] <K3|Chris> I do mostly jS/jQ/C(++) all use semicolons
[06:15:13] <CodesStuff1> "program in VB"
[06:15:15] <CodesStuff1> >mfw
[06:15:16] <CodesStuff1> lol
[06:15:17] <Parhs> hi dudes
[06:15:24] <Roundaround> lol VB.NET
[06:15:27] <Parhs> how to check if this is undefined ? jQuery.parseJSON(media.metadata).title
[06:15:29] <CodesStuff1> lol .net
[06:15:41] <shoky> Parhs: which part of it?
[06:15:44] <CodesStuff1> parhs: typeof, or == undefined
[06:15:58] <Parhs> the title
[06:16:03] <K3|Chris> CodesStuff1: .net is at least better than 6
[06:16:03] <CodesStuff1> K3|Chris: I didn't know jQuery was a language! :P
[06:16:16] <CodesStuff1> Woah now. VB6 is what all the 1337 hax0rs use, dude.
[06:16:19] <K3|Chris> I had to take VB6 in school before I was allowed to take anything else
[06:16:30] <K3|Chris> why? no idea
[06:16:32] <CodesStuff1> All jokes aside, I used to muck about with VB6 back when I was 14 or so.
[06:16:51] <K3|Chris> I haven't used it since
[06:16:52] <shoky> Parhs well if you want to check for undefined and and false-y value then  just  if (!jQuery.parseJSON(media.metadata)) is enough, or what CodesStuff1 said
[06:16:54] <CodesStuff1> I suppose I learned a little bit about programming theory.
[06:16:54] <Roundaround> Ant the people who built the web app I work on did it in the age of VB
[06:17:06] <Roundaround> early min 90's or something
[06:17:07] <Roundaround> lol
[06:17:10] <CodesStuff1> :|
[06:17:14] <Roundaround> All the devs had been used to it
[06:17:20] <shoky> Parhs: if you specifically want to see if its undefined, use === undefined or typeof
[06:17:37] <CodesStuff1> So.. what's everyones' opinion of ASP?
[06:18:10] <CodesStuff1> (Full disclosure: I may or may not be trolling for a debate out of boredom)
[06:18:25] <shoky> how is that full ;)
[06:18:53] <Roundaround> Well, we technically use ASP.NET, but we almost never use the ASP code.  We stick to the code-behind for everything and just make function calls from the .aspx file
[06:19:37] <Roundaround> So I don't know much about it.  From what I could gather, it feels similar to PHP?
[06:19:45] <Roundaround> Just maybe not as flexible
[06:20:13] <CodesStuff1> I've always found it's super bloated (as most .net stuff is)
[06:20:21] <Parhs> thanks
[06:20:52] <shoky> Parhs oops , before i meant:  if (!jQuery.parseJSON(media.metadata).title)
[06:21:12] <CodesStuff1> Then again, I don't use frameworks or anything like that because efficiency/speed/code quality > fast development :3
[06:21:57] <CodesStuff1> Parhs: Why don't you just parse the media object, then iterate through and yoink out the metadata subs you need to access?
[06:22:32] <CodesStuff1> It might be like, 5-10ms slower, but at least you have all the data in an easy object to read from instead of possibly having to make parse call later.
[06:22:53] <sahbeewah> anyone have a good beginner resource for learning apache?
[06:23:17] <Cameron_> no
[06:23:19] <shoky> sahbeewah: i found their docs to be just fine
[06:23:22] <CodesStuff1> ^^
[06:23:43] <CodesStuff1> It depends what you want to learn about, tbh.
[06:24:11] <CodesStuff1> Do you want to write plugins? Tune your server to handle more connections? Optimize the shit out of it to let the world know you've got moves like jagger?
[06:24:22] <shoky> i think he said beginner :P
[06:24:53] <Roundaround> CodesStuff1: lol
[06:24:55] <CodesStuff1> Oh. Well shit. Google "httpd.conf tuning". Max Connections, timeout's, etc.
[06:25:30] <sahbeewah> yeah i've played with it before
[06:25:37] <sahbeewah> looking to hook it up to django, just installed apache
[06:25:43] <CodesStuff1> As with any project, each case will be different. There won't be any quick resource to learn from to answer any immediate questions regarding the problems you may run into.
[06:25:44] <sahbeewah> and my httpd.conf file is empty
[06:25:48] <CodesStuff1> lolwut.
[06:25:49] <sahbeewah> so i'm like ok
[06:25:56] <CodesStuff1> What distro?
[06:25:59] <shoky> there may be other configuration files
[06:26:08] <Cameron_> no
[06:26:08] <sahbeewah> ubuntu
[06:26:11] <CodesStuff1> Yeah. Are you running cPanel or something? They like to hide stuff.
[06:26:33] <sahbeewah> no
[06:26:44] <sahbeewah> it's ok thanks i'll read the docs
[06:26:49] <CodesStuff1> run a whereis httpd.conf
[06:26:58] <shoky> sahbeewah look also for apache2.conf
[06:27:02] <CodesStuff1> Maybe it's been dropped into another location or there is a link to it.
[06:27:07] <CodesStuff1> ^^what shoky said, too
[06:27:25] <sahbeewah> they're in /etc/apache2
[06:27:27] <shoky> in my ubuntu/debian that was the main one
[06:27:32] <shoky> that loaded all the rest
[06:27:32] <CodesStuff1> Oh derp, yeah.
[06:27:41] <CodesStuff1> just googled. Ubuntu dumps it into apache2.conf
[06:27:58] <shoky> for example it loads ports.conf
[06:28:12] <shoky> and the enabled mods and enabled sites
[06:28:15] <CodesStuff1> This is a comment excerpt from a stackoverflow thread asking a similar question, sahbeewah:
[06:28:15] <CodesStuff1> "The httpd.conf is designed for user  configurations.  You really should not edit the apache2.conf as it may  be updated by future upgrades.  An additional option is to just put your custom configuration into  /etc/apache2/conf.d, all files in this directory are included as well. "
[06:29:26] <CodesStuff1> I probably should've known that since my local server (my netbook lol) runs BT5 (which is Ubuntu)
[06:29:50] <CodesStuff1> But then again I only use it to test stuff on localhost and as a security camera.
[06:40:24] <gnarf> on a debian/ubuntu host you put sites in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled and mods using "a2enmod" or /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
[06:40:41] <Roundaround> So, why is it that my JQueryUI call to removeClass and addClass aren't animating background-color?  I am giving elements base styling then adding and removing special properties via those functions.  For convenience, I'd rather not enter in all the styling into the JS code
[06:40:50] <gnarf> anything else you can put in conf.d
[06:40:58] <Roundaround> But from what I can find, that seems to be the only option
[06:41:30] <gnarf> Roundaround: animateClass should animate background color
[06:42:43] <gnarf> Roundaround: http://jsfiddle.net/yTtpp/
[06:43:35] <Roundaround> Huh, so toggle animates colors, but add and remove don't?
[06:43:35] <gnarf> if it isn't animating either a) you aren't including jquery ui effects core, b) there is an inline style that overrides it
[06:43:45] <gnarf> Roundaround: toggle just calls add and remove
[06:44:11] <gnarf> Roundaround: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/dYjaj/
[06:44:28] <gnarf> note that when the style describes a color, it wins over any classes
[06:44:48] <CodesStuff1> Yeah
[06:44:59] <CodesStuff1> Was just watching the style in the DOM w/ firebug
[06:45:13] <CodesStuff1> changes onclick, but the BG is already set so the class won't overwrite the properties within
[06:45:41] <Roundaround> Right, and I don't have any inline styling.  Yet nothing is being animated.  It just sits idle for the duration parameter's length, then instantly changes
[06:45:54] <gnarf> Roundaround: what version of UI / jQuery?
[06:46:20] <Roundaround> the latest of both
[06:46:33] <gnarf> Roundaround: see ?demo
[06:46:33] <bot-t> Roundaround, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:47:01] <gnarf> Roundaround: latest stable has no issues with animated classes AFAIK
[06:47:07] <CodesStuff1> oh god. rainymoods song today sucks.
[06:47:25] <gnarf> and considering I maintain effects in both UI and core - I would hopefully know ;)
[06:47:52] <Roundaround> well it seems toggleClass is at least doing something now, but I think my code might be broken somewhere
[06:47:57] <CodesStuff1> gnarf: You're one of the official jQ devs? O-o
[06:48:04] <Roundaround> wait what?

[06:48:39] <gnarf> :)
[06:48:59] <CodesStuff1> Well look at you Mr. Fancy-pants
[06:49:36] <gnarf> Roundaround: if you can point me at the site where its broken and give me steps to reproduce, I can prolly figure out your problem
[06:50:00] <CodesStuff1> I REQUIRE AN AUTOGRAPH. can you generate a private key and sign it for me, gnarf?
[06:50:05] <CodesStuff1> Trollface.jpg
[06:50:12] <gnarf> lol

[06:50:45] <CodesStuff1> Good tune.
[06:50:54] <CodesStuff1> SFW lyrics etc.
[06:52:01] <shoshy> hey, i'm trying to slideToggle (have a visible button that sitts on a menu(hidden) in the bottom of the screen, pressing it will load a menu (the button sitts on it)): here's an example http://jsfiddle.net/NReSK/4/ - (btw slideDown doesn't work). Problem: it slide EVERYTHING down. I want to stop it when 90% is hidden. Is that possible?
[06:52:07] <Cameron_> no
[06:52:33] <gnarf> shoshy: you should just animate height then
[06:52:52] <shoshy> gnarf: how can i animate with the slide effect?
[06:53:02] <CodesStuff1> The same way jQuery does it.. -.-
[06:53:03] <Roundaround> gnarf: Hah, I feel a bit stupid.  It was broken because I had .toggle() instead of .toggleClass()
[06:53:15] <Roundaround> but anyway, I'm back the issue from before of no animation
[06:53:17] <CodesStuff1> elem.style.height++ in a for
[06:53:30] <gnarf> shoshy: see ?animate
[06:53:30] <bot-t> shoshy, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[06:53:34] <Roundaround> http://jsfiddle.net/Roundaround/3qZaF/
[06:53:56] <Roundaround> Ignore bad coding style, this is a proof of concept for now
[06:53:59] <CodesStuff1> roundaround: 'sup with the slow transitions?
[06:54:13] <shoshy> gnarf: thanks!
[06:54:26] <gnarf> Roundaround: also - animate class isn't aware of how to animate gradients either
[06:54:37] <Roundaround> CodesStuff1: what the 'customer' wants
[06:54:47] <Roundaround> gnarf: ah
[06:54:55] <Roundaround> so is there no way around that?
[06:55:12] <gnarf> Roundaround: nope, i don't even think that CSS3 transitions can animate gradient backgrounds
[06:56:29] <CodesStuff1> Not even with a cleaup then overwrite?
[06:56:37] <CodesStuff1> cleanup*
[06:56:52] <CodesStuff1> If not, you could hack something together with the canvas element and go straight ghetto with it.
[06:57:10] <Roundaround> CodesStuff1: that's what I was thinking, hah
[06:57:12] <CodesStuff1> Might be a little intense as far as CPU goes
[06:57:26] <Roundaround> Though I was thinking more on the lines of just adding an overlay to inacitve tabs
[06:57:30] <CodesStuff1> But then again if you're not dynamically creating canvas's on the fly you should be fine
[06:57:58] <CodesStuff1> Actually.. why not just use an image? lol
[06:58:10] <Roundaround> Images are so 2004 ;)
[06:58:12] <shoky> write some shaders
[06:58:16] <shoky> ;XD
[06:58:21] <gnarf> afk a bit
[06:59:09] <Roundaround> well how difficult would it be to just throw a shader overlay on top?
[06:59:10] <CodesStuff1> Well back in '99 when I was screaming "hack the planet", we rendered entities representing objects within our filesystems in OpenGL to hack the Gibson.
[06:59:20] <CodesStuff1> You could do something similar with WebGL and a used toothbrush.
[06:59:20] <Roundaround> then just toggle the flat background-color?
[06:59:45] <CodesStuff1> You mean like a transleucent gradient image and adjust the BG color?
[06:59:50] <Roundaround> right
[07:00:02] <Roundaround> well, ideally I would still avoid images
[07:00:03] <CodesStuff1> Not really that difficult.
[07:00:05] <Roundaround> but that's the idea
[07:00:14] <CodesStuff1> Well dude.. generate them one-time
[07:00:18] <CodesStuff1> then use the dataURI schema
[07:00:19] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/admin/staticpage/FE_aboutus/edit   admin / adminpass
[07:00:34] <Parhs> can anyone explain me why onearth at opera if you click upload files
[07:00:52] <Parhs> you get bullshit if you refresh tha page ?
[07:01:15] <CodesStuff1> Parhs: This looks very russian and it scares me.
[07:01:22] <CodesStuff1> Inb4 metasploit modules load.
[07:01:22] <Roundaround> ^^
[07:01:29] <shoky> greek ;p
[07:01:34] <CodesStuff1> OH GOD. PARHS HAS HACKED THE PLANET
[07:01:41] <CodesStuff1> GOD DAMNIT. MY MEGAHERTZ ARE GONE
[07:01:43] <Cameron_> no
[07:01:56] <Parhs> russian ?
[07:01:59] <Cameron_> no
[07:02:03] <shoshy> gnarf: that worked! one problem, when it slides down, it hides the button and another element... and when it finishes it shows them
[07:02:06] <Cameron_> no
[07:02:12] <CodesStuff1> ...Maybe?
[07:02:14] <shoshy> (i'm using the animate as you suggested0
[07:02:21] <Parhs> what tek heck ?
[07:02:51] <Parhs> nice photo dude
[07:02:53] <Parhs> :D
[07:02:58] <CodesStuff1> :D
[07:03:04] <Parhs> in opera if you click refresh
[07:03:11] <Parhs> upload files popup wont work
[07:03:14] <CodesStuff1> Yeah, I read "opera" after I uploaded it.
[07:03:24] <CodesStuff1> Believe it or not i don't even have Opera installed.
[07:03:26] <Parhs> it works first time you visit the page
[07:03:33] <Parhs> what do you have ?
[07:03:47] <CodesStuff1> I tested that in Firefox just then, and everything appeared to be fine.
[07:03:56] <CodesStuff1> The only errors in my console were CSS-related
[07:04:04] <Parhs> it works fine ie8 and great , ff, chrome, safari
[07:04:07] <CodesStuff1> Well, asset related.
[07:04:16] <Parhs> and opera unless you click refresh
[07:04:29] <Parhs> very weird problem..
[07:04:36] <Parhs> i removed all other js etc
[07:04:38] <xrdodrx> unless your site is destined for use in eastern europe, i think you can safely ignore opera bugs
[07:04:40] <Parhs> and css
[07:04:45] <CodesStuff1> Breakpoint ALL the things!
[07:04:57] <Cameron_> no
[07:05:01] <shoky> xrdodrx: he's greek :P
[07:05:04] <CodesStuff1> Yeah lol
[07:05:07] <shoky> the site is
[07:05:12] <xrdodrx> might be a problem then! :p
[07:05:16] <shoky> :p
[07:05:20] <CodesStuff1> I'm honestly surprised I even had the font pack for that.
[07:05:27] <Parhs> lol
[07:05:57] <Parhs> but what could be a resonable explantation for this bug ?
[07:06:06] <Parhs> if you hit refresh it wont work
[07:07:15] <CodesStuff1> Maybe the form is being submitted twice?
[07:07:15] <Parhs> is that you in the photo ?
[07:07:24] <Parhs> the is no form submited
[07:07:34] <CodesStuff1> Yes. I'm a meth addict with a 12 inch tall forehead.
[07:07:58] <CodesStuff1> Hmm, now it's my turn to ask some questions.
[07:08:13] <CodesStuff1> Anyone know what the best way to animate these divs in a draggable/droppable/stackable way would be? http://i.imgur.com/HrYTo.jpg
[07:08:14] <Parhs> you are funny
[07:08:35] <CodesStuff1> I also have decent bonestructure and enjoy long walks on the beach, Parhs.
[07:08:39] <CodesStuff1> A/S/L BRAH
[07:08:59] <Parhs> what do you mean animate them ?
[07:09:19] <CodesStuff1> Well, since they're supposed to be polaroid photos, I'd like to give the user the ability to stack them
[07:09:26] <CodesStuff1> drag them around the "desk" and stuff
[07:09:30] <Parhs> order them ?
[07:09:37] <Parhs> place them where he likes ?
[07:09:52] <CodesStuff1> yeah, just within the "wooden" container div
[07:10:17] <Parhs> have you tried sortable of jquery ?
[07:10:26] <Parhs> with small grid maybe
[07:10:29] <CodesStuff1> I know jQuery has tons of options and plugins for this kind of thing, but I try to avoid extra code if I can.
[07:11:01] <Parhs> maybe you should do something if they are out of browser bounds
[07:11:06] <CodesStuff1> Btw, the picture divs are generated via tmpl, if that makes using certain libs/plugins impossible.
[07:11:16] <CodesStuff1> Yeah, like remove them from the dom.
[07:11:31] <CodesStuff1> Then force the user to print the page and redirect them to a cat video.
[07:13:00] <Parhs> i think that there arent lots of ready made things
[07:13:07] <shoky> Parhs: what's the issue again?
[07:13:14] <shoky> click upload-files and then refresh?
[07:13:19] <CodesStuff1> Well jQ UI has some draggable stuff
[07:13:34] <CodesStuff1> Watch the headers in Opera, btw
[07:13:42] <CodesStuff1> that might be one of the problems
[07:14:12] <shoky> i dont see any problem in opera
[07:16:18] <Parhs> shoky which version
[07:16:19] <Parhs> ?
[07:16:33] <shoky> 12.01
[07:16:35] <shoky> (portable)
[07:16:46] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/admin/staticpage/FE_aboutus/edit
[07:16:51] <shoky> do i need to actually upload a file?
[07:16:52] <Parhs> so you visit this page
[07:16:55] <Parhs> no
[07:16:59] <Parhs> and click upload files
[07:17:08] <Parhs> and the uploader appears right ?
[07:17:11] <shoky> yep
[07:17:19] <Parhs> now if you hit f5
[07:17:24] <Parhs> and click upload files again
[07:17:26] <Parhs> does it work ?
[07:17:40] <shoky> yep
[07:17:45] <Parhs> strange
[07:17:53] <Parhs> operating system ?
[07:17:59] <shoky> win7
[07:18:10] <Parhs> me 2
[07:19:15] <Parhs> http://i.imgur.com/BC3z9.png
[07:19:23] <Parhs> this is what i get after i click refresh
[07:19:38] <Parhs> maybe restart computer ??
[07:20:03] <shoky> Parhs
[07:20:09] <shoky> i just uplaoded a file
[07:20:11] <shoky> and then refreshed
[07:20:14] <shoky> and now i see it too
[07:20:17] <Parhs> strange
[07:20:55] <CodesStuff1> Ended up just using jquery ui's .draggable() func
[07:21:07] <Parhs> wtf happens there
[07:21:42] <shoky> Parhs: when i inspect elements, then just click on the 'cboxContent' div, it suddenly shows
[07:21:52] <CodesStuff1> http://i.imgur.com/sYIcT.jpg
[07:21:52] <shoky> but as soon as i move to another element it disappears
[07:22:00] <s0u][ight> hello, how can i check what div the mouse has entered after it has left another div?
[07:22:04] <CodesStuff1> Now to make them all sortable
[07:22:08] <Parhs> i have noticed that too
[07:22:19] <Parhs> opera bug maybe ?
[07:22:34] <shoky> maybe yeah..
[07:22:41] <Parhs> shit :)
[07:22:42] <CodesStuff1> s0u][ight: Declare a global variable, then onmouseover of div X, set the global variable to the div's ID
[07:22:47] <shoky> donno enough about opera tho, first time i use it :P
[07:22:52] <CodesStuff1> then onmouseover of another div, check that global var
[07:23:01] <CodesStuff1> It's ghetto, but should work fine
[07:24:17] <Parhs> shoky i should ignore it ?
[07:24:34] <Parhs> at least it works normall
[07:24:36] <Parhs> y
[07:26:04] <shoky> Parhs: if i make cboxWrapper wider  (e.g. width: 700px )
[07:26:08] <shoky> then the content shows
[07:26:51] <shoky> Parhs: and also #colorbox
[07:26:56] <s0u][ight> CodesStuff1: thanks, trying to figure out how i'd implement that over here :)
[07:27:14] <CodesStuff1> sou][ight, make a jsfiddle and I'll show you :P
[07:27:17] <Parhs> but why that happens at refresh ?
[07:27:47] <s0u][ight> CodesStuff1: i'd like to try out myself first
[07:28:01] <CodesStuff1> kk
[07:28:53] <shoky> Parhs: donno
[07:29:10] <Parhs> thats strange
[07:58:48] <schtinky> Hi guys. Question: Trying to alert-print a JSON object with $.getJSON(url, function(data) { alert(data);});
[07:59:13] <schtinky> firebug assures me that the response from "url" is a valid json object, yet alert always  crashes with "data is null"
[07:59:47] <schtinky> it's as if the JSON response is not making its way into the "data" variable. I'm very new to JQuery and don't understand why
[07:59:51] <schtinky> any help would be greatly appreciated
[07:59:56] <s0u][ight> CodesStuff1: couldn't get it to work :(
[08:13:56] <batdorf> if jslint is giving me an error that a function if being used before it's defined, and that function is in a click event, should I worry? (the function would be defined before it's ever clicked)
[08:14:27] <batdorf> is*
[08:19:57] <batdorf> im going to bed now. if someone has a reply, can you PM it to me? :) Thanks
[08:20:49] <CodesStuff1> http://i.imgur.com/sYIcT.jpg
[08:20:53] <CodesStuff1> someone give me a name for this
[08:20:58] <CodesStuff1> not winstagram :P
[08:28:16] <s0u][ight> $(".submenu").mouseleave(function() { some code here }); i'd like the code "some code here" to be run after 100 miliseconds, how can I achieve this?
[08:29:02] <Parhs> hello
[08:29:02] <shoky> s0u][ight:  setTimeout(function() {  some code here }, 100);
[08:29:04] <jkarsrud> s0u][ight: setTimeout inside the handler function?
[08:29:05] <CodesStuff1> setTimeout(function(){ more code here },100);
[08:29:07] <Parhs> could anyone tell me
[08:29:10] <CodesStuff1> damn
[08:29:12] <kamsky> hi, do you guys know any jquery plugin that shows some social media icons to share your linkedin, twitter, etc..??
[08:29:14] <CodesStuff1> quick fingers :P

[08:29:55] <Parhs> between menu and slideshow second picture
[08:30:09] <Parhs> parhs has the problem although js and css is identical
[08:33:14] <Parhs> all the fucking crazy problems
[08:37:36] <s0u][ight> CodesStuff1: got it working!!!
[08:37:50] <CodesStuff1> congrats my ninja
[08:37:59] <CodesStuff1> now go swag out like caillou

[08:38:37] <s0u][ight> nah, now i have to get links inside that submenu div and stuff
[08:39:32] * s0u][ight was actually watchin caillou with his little brother
[08:40:09] <Parhs> found the problem
[08:40:15] <Parhs> including lightbox
[08:40:18] <Parhs> fixes the problem
[08:40:21] <Parhs> dont know why
[08:53:45] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org
[08:53:56] <Parhs> i have a 1px gap between menu and slideshow only in chrome
[08:54:06] <Parhs> if you open developer tools it is ok
[08:54:55] <jita> how can i refactor this code? http://dpaste.org/siThC/ ? The only difference between PusherActivityStreamer and PusherActivityStreamer is few lines in function _buildListItem
[09:39:37] <imsky> hello you jerks
[09:44:19] <rayn> hello all
[09:44:22] <CodesStuff1> I disagree.
[09:44:27] <rayn> I have a doubt
[09:45:09] <rayn> i have a widget which loads in iframe,this widget has an 'ajaxStart()' method
[09:45:42] <rayn> So will it be triggered if any ajax call originates from the parent page
[09:49:26] <rayn> i have a widget which loads in iframe,this widget has an 'ajaxStart()' method
[09:49:33] <rayn> So will it be triggered if any ajax call originates from the parent page
[09:50:16] <CodesStuff1> rayn: wtf @ engrish brah
[09:50:38] <axscodes> http://pastebin.com/8N0phYsm <--- hi guys just wondering, in chrome it is working great, but in IE... when i tried selecting an option to dropdown after clicking it closes the kycform. any hep..
[09:50:59] <CodesStuff1> toss it up in a jsfiddle
[09:51:03] <CodesStuff1> please and thank you :P
[09:51:44] <rayn> CodesStuff1: what's wrong with my so called 'engrish'?
[09:52:01] <CodesStuff1> The way you worded it was odd
[09:52:46] <rayn> CodesStuff1:yeah,that's what I'm asking about
[09:53:12] <CodesStuff1> Oh - is English not your native language?
[09:53:19] <CodesStuff1> If so I apologize :3
[09:54:17] <rayn> CodesStuff1:it's not
[09:57:32] <CodesStuff1> axscides: your div ID
[09:57:36] <CodesStuff1> "kycform"
[09:57:41] <CodesStuff1> the "f" is lowercase
[09:57:51] <CodesStuff1> but you reference "#kycForm" in your javascript
[09:58:26] <CodesStuff1> so <div id="kycForm"> would be the correct id
[09:58:27] <CodesStuff1> :P
[09:59:09] <CodesStuff1> and rayn, as for your question, I think you'll need to hook the parent window for that to work
[09:59:44] <axscodes> code sorry i just retyped it, but its perfect casing
[10:00:22] <rayn> lol,you didn't understand my question
[10:01:10] <rayn> according to jquery docs,it seems I can't bind ajaxStart() to any particular element
[10:01:17] <CodesStuff1> Oh
[10:01:57] <axscodes> rayn, what element are you trying to hook for ajaxStart()?
[10:02:37] <rayn> Suppose my widget loads in an iframe
[10:03:42] <rayn> So i'm trying to hook a 'div' inside my widget for ajaxStart()
[10:05:06] <axscodes> ic, i actually doing the same earlier.. though ajaxStart on img in target iframe.
[10:07:01] <rayn> So if any ajax call starts on the page containing the iframe,will it effect the ajaxStart of target iframe?
[10:07:53] <axscodes> im not really sure, that depends on the event howd you want to start ajax?
[10:08:02] <axscodes> ajax/json
[10:09:23] <rayn> json
[10:10:09] <rayn> sorry,i didn't understand
[10:12:48] <prefixed> Can someone explain the difference between the following lines:
[10:13:03] <prefixed> .jPlayer('onProgressChange', function(loadPercent, playedPercentRelative, playedPercentAbsolute, playedTime, totalTime)
[10:13:08] <prefixed> Drupal.jPlayer('onProgressChange', function(loadPercent, playedPercentRelative, playedPercentAbsolute, playedTime, totalTime)

[10:42:28] <fatAgnes> hey
[10:44:08] <fatAgnes> I need a CMS
[10:44:20] <fatAgnes> what would you guys recoomend  Joomla?
[10:44:24] <fatAgnes> or something else?
[10:46:55] <Lindrian> Hey. I am trying to fade in/out elements with class "hitarea" on hover, like so: http://pastebin.com/7yzPqzaZ
[10:47:06] <Lindrian> However, it's very scetchy. Doesnt work all the time and is over all not working very well.
[10:47:28] <Lindrian> #treeview is the container, I want .hitarea to be displayed as soon as I enter the container, in any way possible, and remove them when I leave it
[10:47:39] <Lindrian> Does anybody know how I can improve my code?
[10:48:16] <Lindrian> I have declared timer/temptimer above in the document
[11:10:19] <Cache_Money> Can anyone tell me why when I submit a number it shows up momentarily in the <div> and then disappears?  Should I not include the code within the .click function?  http://pastie.org/4395510
[11:13:36] <xec_> Cache_Money: what was the expected result?
[11:15:50] <Cache_Money> xec_: I'd like the guess to be added to the div which is above the input field (just testing this functionality). Right now, it only displays for a split second before disappearing
[11:17:26] <xec_> Cache_Money: then you need to prevent the default action (which is to submit and refresh the page) byt calling .preventDefault() on the event object, which is the 1st parameter passed to the event handler
[11:17:49] <Cache_Money> the .click event?
[11:17:54] <xec_> right
[11:17:58] <xec_> something like .click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); .... })
[11:18:08] <xec_> "e" or "event" are common names
[11:18:17] <Cache_Money> ok, thanks.  I'll give that a try
[11:20:17] <xec_> Cache_Money: also, parseInt will always return a number type, so the typeof check is redundant
[11:21:22] <Cache_Money> True.  Is there a way to check that it's an integer (ie not containing a decimal place?)
[11:21:42] <Cache_Money> Also, now when I submit a number it appears.  However, when I attempt to submit another number it replaces the previous one.  Is there a way to add to have a running list of submissions instead of replacing them?
[11:21:53] <xec_> parseInt will return an integer (not a float)
[11:22:14] <xec_> Cache_Money: try .append() instead of .html()
[11:22:49] <Cache_Money> sweet
[11:23:08] <xec_> i think it needs an element to live in though
[11:23:22] <Cache_Money> xec_: do you know how to clear the input field once the submit button is clicked?
[11:23:50] <xec_> so .append("<span>"+guess+"</span>") or .append($("span", {text: guess}))
[11:24:10] <xec_> Cache_Money: you can just set the value to ""
[11:24:24] <Cache_Money> good call
[11:26:56] <ravenzz> ?$('<span/>', { text: "foo"})
[11:26:58] <bot-t> ravenzz, #1959 ("strings are automatically evaluated" - NOT!) – jQuery Core ... - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1959
[11:27:01] <ravenzz> -?
[11:28:37] <imsky> they know they know
[11:30:13] <Cache_Money> xec_: I can't set the value... I've tried $('#guess').value = ""; / $('#guess').val() = ""; / $('#guess').content = ""; .  Am I missing something?
[11:31:38] <xec_> Cache_Money: try .val("")
[11:32:17] <Cache_Money> xec_: that worked. Thanks
[11:47:30] <ishi> I was looking for some kind of tutorial, but couldn't find anything...  I'd like to know how to structure a page so that it integrates well with jquery theming...
[11:48:28] <ishi> this is the only thing I've found: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Theming/API
[11:48:36] <ishi> but it lists only few classes...
[11:50:46] <ishi> I tried to look at the jquery.com page, but even they don't use those classes ;)
[11:53:05] <LindsayMac> Has anyone done anything like a lazy loader for background images?
[11:57:06] <HektoR> Hello guys. has anyone any success with jquery UI and twitter bootstrap 2 working together?
[11:58:08] <LindsayMac> HektoR:  yea i had them both working together for a couple projects
[11:59:00] <HektoR> LindsayMac: really ? are you using original jquery ui or modifiend one ? http://addyosmani.github.com/jquery-ui-bootstrap/
[11:59:19] <LindsayMac> the original.. i didnt know the modified one existed..
[11:59:32] <LindsayMac> I didnt use every aspect of Jquery UI because where I could, I used bootstrap..
[12:00:52] <HektoR> LindsayMac: have use used range slider ?
[12:01:21] <LindsayMac> NO i haven't used that one yet..
[12:14:33] <HektoR> LindsayMac: aah... i tested it again ... only slider has some problem.. datepicker works great... slider says "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'left' of null "
[12:15:59] <LindsayMac> Do you have a property there at all?
[12:16:17] <amh345> i've got a page that has some jquery that changes the source path for all the images.  i find that i see red x's display when the page is hit and before the jquery executes.   after the jquery runs the red x's disappear and the page shows fine.  what i'd like to know is how to best handle this.   i'd like to only display the page AFTER the jquery function runs.
[12:17:29] <LindsayMac> amh345:  you can try window.onload = function(){  }
[12:17:39] <HektoR> LindsayMac: this error is from jquery ui code
[12:17:52] <HektoR> LindsayMac: seems like bug probably
[12:18:06] <axscodes> just want to clarify is it.. var container = $("#assignAmount, #activateCards"); or var container = $("#assignAmount", "#activateCards");
[12:18:26] <LindsayMac> HektoR:  yes. But are you using a script that is using the left property in your page?
[12:19:57] <HektoR> LindsayMac: no, no other scrips. only jquery and bootsrap
[12:20:33] <LindsayMac> Right.. maybe my terminology is wrong.. but meaning are you initializing a jquery plugin (the slider) and does that use the property left?
[12:22:08] <LindsayMac> I wish some of the web dev / code snippet blogs out there would make sure to have dates on their articles!!!
[12:27:08] <sunbeam> when a ul has more than 3 MAIN (top level) LI items.. the others I want to hide (so <ul li li li LI <-) 4th and more
[12:27:14] <sunbeam> how can i do this?
[12:30:35] <LindsayMac> I think you need to use .length
[12:31:13] <LindsayMac> You can set it default css display:none and then count the first 4 and change those to display:block
[12:32:53] <sunbeam> ok letok
[12:32:57] <sunbeam> ok lets check
[12:33:36] <sunbeam> if ($('#menu ul li').length > 3)) { // .. }
[12:34:18] <smellynosery> Probably have to .each ul and do if(i>3) { $(this).hide();} i++;
[12:34:37] <sunbeam> ok
[12:34:58] <sunbeam> and hiding any lever deeper than 1 (ul li ul) i can just do something like ul li ul ul{display: none}
[12:35:01] <sunbeam> right
[12:36:13] <LindsayMac> makes sense.. haven't tried it..
[12:36:55] <tash1> anyone in here used the plugin DataTables?
[12:37:03] <majd> Hey #jquery - i have a bunch of <a> elements with display: none on my page. I have a button with .click() that shows a subset of those elements based on the id. The elements are showing for a small instant, then they disappear again - what's causing this??
[12:37:20] <majd> i have a live demo link that i can share privately if that helps
[12:37:29] <LindsayMac> ahh i had a similar issue.. i am trying to remember what the issue was..
[12:38:36] <wfq> hi guys
[12:38:48] <LindsayMac> i am pretty certain it had to do with where i had the .click()
[12:38:56] <LindsayMac> majd:  can you make a fiddle?
[12:39:54] <wfq> does anyone know why firebug is complaining saying that ReferenceError: severData is not defined (http://dpaste.com/781923/)
[12:40:14] <wfq> every 10 seconds I do an ajax request
[12:42:23] <wfq> why isn't serverData defined?
[12:42:54] <wfq> my goodness! it was misspelt
[12:43:17] <sunbeam> jQuery(".footer-menu ul > li").each(function() { }
[12:43:25] <iamjarvo> is there a jqury time picker plugin? i saw there is an addition to datepicker but it still involves the datepicker
[12:43:27] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this? I only want the level 1 ul items
[12:43:30] <sunbeam> not the others
[12:43:52] <tash1> wfq: yep, just noticed that and was gonna point it out
[12:45:22] <LindsayMac> wfq:  sometimes you have to ask in order to see something like that
[12:46:05] <wfq> hahah, sorry guys. It is stupid but what LindsayMac said is true. Sometimes that is the way to go
[12:46:07] <wfq> :)
[12:46:14] <LindsayMac> no need to say sorry
[12:46:17] <tash1> totally agree
[12:46:39] <tash1> I've asked some pretty silly stuff only to realize the answer almost immediately
[12:46:46] <tash1> isn't it called 'rubber ducking' ?
[12:46:49] <LindsayMac> me too...
[12:47:00] <LindsayMac> lol yea.. apparently i got yelled at for rubber ducking once
[12:47:04] <LindsayMac> i didn't even know what it was.
[12:47:16] <tash1> got yelled at in here for rubber ducking?
[12:47:31] <LindsayMac> yea... and asking too many questions.
[12:47:44] <LindsayMac> basically for all around being a "help vampire"
[12:47:52] <tash1> dang, that's kind of the point of this room isn't it?
[12:48:11] <tash1> we all need to read docs and such, but why have a room if we can't ask questions, etc?
[12:48:20] <LindsayMac> who knows. I explained my situation and left it at that. I was building a site that used a lot of jquery and i'm new to it.. not new to coding.
[12:48:37] <LindsayMac> I read EVERYTHING i can before coming here and make fiddles where possible.. that was it
[12:48:42] <LindsayMac> but whatevs..
[12:48:46] <LindsayMac> yep, i just said whatevs
[12:48:51] <LindsayMac> so what. haha
[12:49:04] <tash1> I find myself saying that often
[12:49:13] <tash1> LindsayMac, have you used DataTables before?
[12:49:48] <LindsayMac> no HOWEVER i had looked in to it for a UI i am working on
[12:50:02] <LindsayMac> it looks pretty awesome for what it is
[12:50:30] <tash1> yeah, I was going to ask for some help but I forgot what I was going to ask now :)
[12:50:47] <LindsayMac> LOL
[12:51:11] <tash1> ah I remember now
[12:51:41] <tash1> probably some styling issue, DataTables has sort arrows, and mind are bleeding into some of my <th>'s
[12:51:58] <LindsayMac> Ahh.. probably a CSS issue..
[12:52:11] <LindsayMac> do you have a CSS reset ?
[12:53:01] <tash1> If I have a <th> that is rather short like: State and everything in the column has a value like NE, KS, CA, SC, WI, and so on .... the sort arrows bleed into "State".  If the values in the column were longer, like: Wisconsin, North Carolina, etc. then the sort arrows would be where the longest one ends
[12:53:04] <tash1> kinda weird
[12:53:56] <tash1> so, basically, the sort arrows are at the position where the <td> value ends, regardless if that bleeds into the <th> if that makes any sense.
[12:54:00] <LindsayMac> set a min-width
[12:54:07] <LindsayMac>  
[12:54:08] <LindsayMac> ?
[12:54:10] <LindsayMac>  
[12:54:13] <LindsayMac> oops.. sorry
[12:54:33] <tash1> ah, min width on the td?
[12:55:05] <LindsayMac> Yea.. try that
[12:55:16] <LindsayMac> or some padding to the right side
[12:56:06] <tash1> damn
[12:56:08] <tash1> that was easy :)
[12:56:11] <tash1> thx yo!
[12:56:12] <LindsayMac> tash1:  it seems that in their example they set a defined width for the headings.. not sure if you were doing that
[12:56:15] <LindsayMac> lol no prob!
[12:56:22] <tash1> no, I wasn't
[12:56:26] <tash1> can you paste what they set?
[12:56:28] <LindsayMac> yea.. that's it.
[12:56:31] <tash1> I'll check against my code
[12:56:51] <LindsayMac> So whatever you have now should work.. whether it be a min-width, padding, or specific width..
[12:57:03] <tash1> I set min-width
[12:57:56] <LindsayMac> yea.. you should be fine with that..
[12:58:03] <kblin> hi folks
[12:58:08] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/
[12:58:27] <Parhs> i have problem with chrome
[12:58:28] <LindsayMac> that way if you randomly have some bit that is LONGER than your defined width, it wont get cut off..
[12:58:47] <Parhs> if page doesnt have scrollbar it has 1px gap between menu and pictures
[12:59:07] <Parhs> but if you select something to redraw the browser it works
[12:59:21] <ishi> heh... I think I finally 'got' how the -ui is supposed to be used ;)
[12:59:34] <ishi> gosh...  why don't they tell this in the beginning ;)
[13:02:16] <LindsayMac> ishi:  then it wouldnt be like a fun scavenger hunt
[13:23:08] <VectorX> i want to filter an ajax resultset using a text inputbox when the user types in it, what would be the best event to use for that ? i want to do it as they type
[13:24:03] <VectorX> not sure which to use change or keypress or something else perhaps
[13:24:42] <dabear> VectorX: keyup
[13:24:54] <dabear> or keydown
[13:24:55] <VectorX> ok ty
[13:25:04] <VectorX> uh which one
[13:30:15] <kblin> ok, I don't get this. I'm trying to send an ajax request to the server using $.post('url', {name: "Bob"}, function(reply) { console.log(reply); });, but for some reason the data sent to the server reaches it as key=value pair
[13:30:40] <kblin> so name=Bob, whereas I'd expect { name: "Bob" }
[13:30:50] <kblin> what am I doing wrong?
[13:31:12] <shoky> kblin: nothing, that is how POST parameters are sent
[13:31:54] <kblin> ok, so I can't POST json data?
[13:32:01] <IvanKuzev> you can.
[13:32:11] <IvanKuzev> just prepare it as a string first
[13:32:46] <IvanKuzev> and then do something like  $.post('url', {data: datavariable}, function(reply) { console.log(reply); })
[13:33:50] <IvanKuzev> and then you will have data="{ name: "Bob" }" as post
[13:34:34] <kblin> data=%7Bname%3A+'Bob'%7D, actually
[13:34:42] <kblin> but that's still not valid json
[13:35:32] <shoky> it's not valid json even if that were not encoded
[13:35:50] <kblin> right, that was what I meant
[13:36:14] <Grundell> hello
[13:36:16] <tw2113> encoding? decoding? what is this shit?
[13:36:23] <IvanKuzev> why not use JSON.stringify to encode { name: "Bob" }?
[13:36:26] <shoky> IvanKuzev meant:  $.post('url', {data: JSON.stringify( {name: "Bob"} )}, ...)
[13:36:30] <shoky> :P
[13:37:15] <kblin> shoky: but my impression still is that what my server is seeing is a key=value pair
[13:37:32] <shoky> kblin: indeed, but the value for key 'data' would be a json string
[13:37:47] <IvanKuzev> and you can decode it in the server
[13:38:08] <IvanKuzev> to get an associative array
[13:38:20] <kblin> right, but what's the advantage vs. just sending name=Bob then?
[13:38:30] <mfjordvald> None.
[13:38:42] <shoky> you were complaining about it being name=Bob :P
[13:38:45] <mfjordvald> There's no advantage to json over POST since your backend probably has support for both.
[13:38:46] <shoky> not us :P
[13:38:52] <IvanKuzev> not in this case....but its useful for lists and such
[13:39:01] <kblin> shoky: no, I was complaining that I can't send JSON
[13:39:12] <shoky> implying that you want to send JSON
[13:39:19] <kblin> or rather, I can't send JSON objects
[13:39:20] <shoky> implying that you thought it suits your needs more
[13:39:21] <mfjordvald> kblin: HTTP has no support for JSON no.
[13:39:26] <shoky> not ours
[13:39:27] <shoky> is what i meant.
[13:39:53] <mfjordvald> You can send a JSON string in a standard POST variable, though. But clearly that's not what you want.
[13:40:48] <kblin> mfjordvald: well, if I can get rid of the key= nonesense, my server-side parser would be happy, I guess
[13:40:55] <shoky> :\
[13:41:13] <shoky> we told you how to send a json string if you want to
[13:41:13] <tw2113> the whole structure of json is key/value
[13:41:22] <IvanKuzev> to get JSON object to the server  you have to encode(JSON.stringify) it un the js and then decode it in the server
[13:42:04] <kblin> right, but your proposed solution then added a new key that got sent along
[13:42:18] <kblin> and it's the key= part that makes my parser trip up
[13:42:20] <shoky> do you not want POST parameters sent with your request?
[13:42:41] <shoky> if you do, its key=value
[13:42:42] <shoky> look it up
[13:43:04] <shoky> your serverside doesn't know HTTP POST parameters?
[13:43:32] <kblin> if I post a binary file, my browser adds some key?
[13:43:43] <rue> Maybe itâ€™s a node server
[13:43:45] <shoky> think so
[13:44:25] <IvanKuzev> <kblin> : i think it does unless you are reading raw data
[13:44:39] <IvanKuzev> btw what is the server side?
[13:44:57] <shoky> int socket;
[13:45:14] <kblin> IvanKuzev: it's a Flask app
[13:45:48] <IvanKuzev> uh..dont know that one
[13:46:15] <Grundell> http://jsfiddle.net/UuQ4n/ - how do i get the active page to stay open ?
[13:46:21] <kblin> ok, so if I just $.post('url', JSON.stringify({name: "Bob"}), callback); tthat works as expected
[13:46:40] <kblin> so apparently I can POST data without a key being sent along
[13:47:22] <kblin> arguably, I'm not sure if this is an advantage over just sending name=Bob
[13:47:36] <kblin> I can see how it'd be nicer for more complex data
[13:48:51] <shoky> kblin: no
[13:48:54] <shoky> when you do that,
[13:49:10] <shoky> it sends the string '{"name":"Bob"}'   as a key with no value..
[13:49:21] <IvanKuzev> <Grundell>::not seeing any jquery here..what do are you trying to do?
[13:55:30] <shoky> kblin: well its the content type of the request that makes it key=value encoding. the defualt content type is application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[13:55:51] <shoky> kblin: so if you want to send something else, change the contentType of the request (using $.ajax)
[13:56:38] <shoky> guess it doesn't matter if your server doesnt care about the content type
[13:57:24] <kblin> shoky: I've set the content type to application/json, but $.ajax was still sending key=value stuff
[14:13:11] <sunbeam> how can i find the movie file when i'm watching some tube
[14:16:12] <shoky> kblin: you set it to application/json and you sent a string as your data?
[14:16:23] <shoky> e.g. not  {Name:"Bob"}
[14:23:45] <kblin> shoky: yeah
[14:32:26] <nate76> I'm using jquery.animate to resize a div. It works great when the app is served locally. But with the same browser points to  the deployed page, the animate call does nothing. Everything else in that block, however works beautifully. It all runs out of the browser, any idea what would cause it to behave differently?
[14:33:11] <dabear> ?demo @ nate76
[14:33:12] <bot-t> nate76, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:33:32] <dabear> nate76: different versions of jquery maybe?
[14:33:44] <dabear> and have you checked the error console in your browser?
[14:36:14] <nate76> dabear: same versions, same code. I'll work on creating an example that I can fiddle. It's not open source, but the live page is http://oneredline.co if your interested, but it requires a user account (the person icon in the upper right).
[14:36:38] <dabear> nah
[14:37:02] <nate76> yeah, understand.
[14:37:04] <dabear> create it for me
[14:38:08] <Xtrivity> Hey guys. I am using cookies to expand a menu. I set the value of the cookie to 1  and if i do an if statement it returns true, but the display elements in the code seem to not work. here's what I have.
[14:38:27] <Xtrivity> http://pastebin.com/vsnWF6RX
[14:39:52] <dabear> ?demo @ Xtrivity
[14:39:53] <bot-t> Xtrivity, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:40:36] <Xtrivity> dabear: http://galiakwetny.com
[14:43:09] <Xtrivity> dabear: is that fine for a demo?
[14:43:09] <dabear> Xtrivity: document ready
[14:44:32] <Xtrivity> dabear: thanks boss! haha knew it was something stupid
[14:46:31] <tw2113> i pretty much always wrap in document ready
[14:47:38] <dabear> nate76: can you point me to what I should be looking at?
[14:48:58] <nate76> Sure, in main.js line 249. That animate doesn't seem to respond.
[14:50:24] <dabear> what note card were you talking about?
[14:53:45] <nate76> dabear: The index card should be there now. Just "hover" it onto the "b".
[14:54:25] <dabear> nate76: I see "b", "new card" and "new stack"
[14:54:43] <nate76> dabear: refresh, it should be there.
[14:54:55] <dabear> ah, yep
[14:57:51] <dabear> and how do I get it back again?
[14:57:59] <dabear> deleting cookies had no effect on that
[15:01:25] <nate76> dabear: I'll created a few for you. No way to get them back yet, work in progress. Refresh to see them. You can drag "New Card" onto the middle of the screen to create more.
[15:01:33] <dabear> nate76: since the note card disappared again I can't test it, but if youset a breakpoint on line 249 and try to drop a card on top, you could explore the value of this etc in the console
[15:02:24] <nate76> dabear: Yeah, the values look good in the console. No problem there. thanks for the help, I'll keep working the jsfiddle too.
[15:09:28] * k1ng_ k
[15:10:51] <dabear> nate76: straaange, it seems like it animates for a very short amount of time, then resets
[15:11:01] <dabear> i.e. animates back
[15:11:32] <nate76> dabear: I'll try lengthening the animation time.
[15:12:36] <dabear> seems like after a drop, the "out" code is called immediately
[15:14:08] <nate76> dabear: yes, that's true. But if you don't release the mouse button, it still doesn't show the resize animation... at least for me.
[15:14:15] <dabear> and you cannot animate borderColor
[15:14:45] <dabear> resize animation is there (green border expanding)
[15:16:44] <nate76> really? I don't see it at all. on the site. on my local box (in development),  I do.
[15:16:57] <nate76> what browser are you using?
[15:17:28] <dabear> chrome
[15:19:40] <dabear> nate76: so what's the problem? when dropping or when hovering?
[15:19:47] <LindsayMac> I have this script that initiates an animation when an element moves outside of the viewport. It works AWESOME when moving downard on the site because the element is towards the top and moves out of view quickly. The issue is when moving up the trigger doesnt initiate until it's all the way at the bottom (which it's supposed to). I am trying to basically add an offset so it can initiate the animation either when it
[15:19:47] <LindsayMac> goes out of the viewport from the top OR 600px from the bottom
[15:19:54] <LindsayMac> here is my code: https://gist.github.com/fc87cb51abc570aa31ec
[15:20:29] <nate76> dabear: Hovering wasn't showing the "grow" animation for me. Using the epiphany browser I do see a flicker, so I'm thinking browser cache? Just guessing.
[15:22:16] <dabear> nate76: ctrl+shift+f5 clears cache I think
[15:24:55] <dabear> nate76: since your problem is solved, im outta here :p
[15:24:58] <dabear> c ya
[15:25:06] <nate76> thanks for the help!
[15:28:10] <LindsayMac> Anyone with a thought on my little problem above ?
[15:32:27] <prefixed> why do some HTML elements require $ in front of them?
[15:35:30] <prefixed> e.g. if I do console.log(player) I get HTMLDivELement, but if I do console.log($player)), I get a representation of the actual html for the div
[15:41:27] <LindsayMac> anyone know how to offset the screen height in this code?  https://gist.github.com/fc87cb51abc570aa31ec
[15:47:06] <prefixed> this channel is pretty dead for 771 people
[15:47:30] <LindsayMac> its sunday
[15:47:38] <shoky> prefixed: nothing requires a $ in front of it..
[15:47:51] <shoky> $player would only be defined if you defined it
[15:47:56] <shoky> same for player
[15:48:16] <prefixed> shok, I typo'd I meant console.log($(player))
[15:48:41] <shoky> LindsayMac: here's a fiddle with your code http://jsfiddle.net/tfqnH/
[15:48:49] <shoky> LindsayMac: what exactly do you wanna do?
[15:48:54] <tw2113> oh shit, it's sunday?
[15:49:13] <shoky> already monday here
[15:49:20] <LindsayMac> shoky: wow thanks!! I didn't think it would actually work in a fiddle because of the viewport / iframe thing..
[15:49:28] <LindsayMac> shoky:  sucks for you!..
[15:49:36] <shoky> LindsayMac: almost everything works in a fiddle if you work it :P
[15:49:50] <LindsayMac> Yea i guess you're right. I'm not good enough yet
[15:49:52] <prefixed> shoky, I typo'd. I meant console.log($(player))
[15:50:22] <shoky> prefixed: that means call the jQuery function and pass it whatever is in the player variable
[15:50:50] <prefixed> what is the "jquery function?"
[15:51:16] <shoky> prefixed:  the main jQuery function that you call to use jquery..
[15:51:22] <shoky> e.g. $('#someId')
[15:51:25] <shoky> or $(someElement)
[15:51:39] <shoky> prefixed: anyway console.log output is browser-dependent
[15:51:40] <prefixed> strange
[15:52:09] <shoky> and the html representation you get is just the browser helping you out
[15:52:19] <shoky> or trying to
[15:52:32] <prefixed> hm. ok.
[15:53:11] <prefixed> I'm having a huge problem with a jplayer customization. do you happen to have any experience with it?
[15:53:36] <shoky> nop
[15:54:02] <prefixed> shucks
[15:54:09] <prefixed> it doesn't seem like many people have
[15:54:18] <prefixed> I think I might have to find the developers and give them a call
[15:54:26] <LindsayMac> i played with it a long while ago
[15:56:32] <prefixed> I'm trying to take information from one progress bar, and transpose it elsewhere
[15:56:59] <LindsayMac> yea i didnt get that far into it..
[15:57:09] <prefixed> I don't think anyone has
[15:57:09] <prefixed> ever
[16:01:59] <venus_> hello, I have this code which scrolls down to a certain div, but the scroll is animated to fast, how can i set a time to it, here is the code http://pastebin.com/uP82LY1E
[16:02:11] <venus_> animated too fast*
[16:02:26] <shoky> ?animate @ venus_
[16:02:27] <bot-t> venus_, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:04:03] <venus_> shoky, i saw but not sure where to put the timer value
[16:04:11] <shoky> venus_: duration
[16:04:21] <venus_> i mean where to put the timer value in the code
[16:04:35] <LindsayMac> venus_:  that links shows you exactly where.
[16:04:48] <LindsayMac> After the .animate in the ()
[16:05:08] <shoky> venus_: http://pastebin.com/aHh0vibP
[16:06:28] <venus_> thanks shoky
[16:06:32] <venus_> i am new to jquery :)
[16:06:34] <LindsayMac> shoky:  i've been staring at this code that animates when in viewport, but I am really stumped. I've tried adding and subtracting actual pixel height from the window, but that didnt work.. I am still learning this part of jquery. I've gotten pretty good with animate and some calculating, but this is over my head.
[16:06:53] <shoky> LindsayMac: but what exactly do you want to happen?
[16:07:03] <shoky> now that we have a fiddle to work with it should be simple
[16:07:13] <shoky> to work with, at least :P
[16:07:20] <LindsayMac> shoky:  I want to trigger the change event 500pixels (or a percentage height) before it hit's the bottom...
[16:07:26] <LindsayMac> instead of when it hits the bottom of the viewport.
[16:07:42] <LindsayMac> yes. it is definitely appreciated, you making that. Seriously.
[16:08:01] <shoky> so only the 'out' event?
[16:08:23] <LindsayMac> Yes..
[16:08:50] <LindsayMac> basically want to initiate the animation almost immediately when you start scrolling... but the viewport way was the best way I could get it to work..
[16:09:16] <LindsayMac> if that makes sense.
[16:12:09] <LindsayMac> shoky:  ohh i think i might have gotten it.. but not sure yet
[16:13:02] <LindsayMac> shoky:  take a look at this.. it is KINDA working but not smoothly http://jsfiddle.net/tfqnH/2/
[16:15:33] <shoky> yea i just tried the same thing :P
[16:15:44] <LindsayMac> Ohh that means i'm not entirely useless!
[16:15:58] <shoky> i think this means an extra state is needed
[16:16:02] <shoky> not just is_visible true/false
[16:17:02] <LindsayMac> I don't see what else it would need. I mean, if we just shrink the height of the viewport, or "offset" it, that should be it..
[16:17:04] <LindsayMac> SHOULD
[16:17:28] <LindsayMac> basically saying "get the viewport height and subtract 250px and base all animations off of that"
[16:17:35] <shoky> but as soon as you make it is_visible=true
[16:17:43] <shoky> the IN logic starts working
[16:18:00] <LindsayMac> not sure what you mean..
[16:18:12] <shoky> not sure what you meant either :P
[16:19:03] <LindsayMac> Well imagine the viewport as a window..
[16:19:13] <LindsayMac> i want to animate an element if it enters into the viewport..
[16:20:13] <LindsayMac> NOW let's imagine that the window is still it's normal size, but we hang a curtain across the bottom. I want to basically change it so that the animation doesn't start behind the curtain
[16:26:40] <LindsayMac> shoky:  do you know what clearTimeout does?
[16:29:14] <shoky> yeah
[16:30:18] <LindsayMac> I can't really figure out how to works into this script
[16:30:52] <LindsayMac> I'm basically rying to dissect it.. and for the most part i understand the math, but I do not understand that part and DEFINITELY dont know why my first method didnt really work
[16:32:11] <shoky> is this what you meant? http://jsfiddle.net/tfqnH/3/
[16:33:18] <LindsayMac> shoky:  ohh that could work..
[16:33:48] <shoky> might trigger the out callback more than needed though
[16:34:26] <LindsayMac> Well the good thing is that on my site, I have disabled scrolling via mouse wheel, so it will/should not get clogged up
[16:36:32] <shoky> hmm so, you don't understand what clearTimeout does?
[16:36:47] <shoky> or what
[16:36:51] <LindsayMac> Well.. I read up on the mozilla website..
[16:37:11] <shoky> it just clears the previous timer if one was set
[16:37:16] <LindsayMac> but as I said.. i am learning js and theres a lot of little things to learn, it's one that I haven't really used myself.
[16:37:33] <LindsayMac> but thats what I read on the site, I just didn't know how it was associated with this code
[16:38:29] <shoky> without the clearTimeout, if i'd scroll up and down really quick (triggering many setTimeouts) then they would _all_ be called
[16:38:39] <shoky> instead of just the last one which is what you really care about
[16:38:46] <LindsayMac> Ahhh ok
[16:39:32] <shoky> so it's just an easy way of saying 'ignore all the previous setTimeouts, i only care about the one i'm setting now'
[16:39:58] <LindsayMac> got it.. thanks for taking the time to explain
[16:41:44] <shoky> of course, if the delay is 0 then the clearTimeout isn't of much use
[16:42:14] <LindsayMac> So if I did this: window_dimensions.height - (window_dimensions.height / 2)
[16:42:23] <LindsayMac> would that give the value of 50% of the window height?
[16:42:59] <shoky> x - (x/2)  == x/2  :P
[16:43:01] <shoky> yeah
[16:43:20] <LindsayMac> Well yea i know math.. but wasn't sure if it was the correct way to do it in JS
[16:44:12] <LindsayMac> hmm.. not working as expected on my site.. I will have to look further into why
[16:44:23] <shoky> it is, i was just pointing out that it's the same as just window_dimensions.height/2
[16:44:49] <LindsayMac> Ohh hahah
[16:44:51] <LindsayMac> so it is
[16:45:16] <shoky> ;p
[16:45:21] <shoky> bbs
[16:45:34] <LindsayMac> np
[16:46:52] <LindsayMac> my math skills arent as good as I thought..
[16:48:20] <Aquaguy> Hello
[16:49:04] <Aquaguy> is there any way to call a function after a fadeIn(500).delay(3000) ?
[16:55:22] <Ganymede> I defined a click handler like so: $('.right-panel>a').click(my_function); When I click an element that matches '.right-panel>a', my_function is fired not once as I expect it to, but 40 times, and every time, e.target is indeed the a element I clicked. As it turns out, I have 40 elements that match that selector. Am I doing it wrong? Not enough information to determine what I did wrong?
[17:01:49] <Aquaguy> Hello
[17:01:51] <Aquaguy> box.fadeIn(options.fadeInDuration).delay(options.standbyDuration).fadeIn(0, function() { close(); });
[17:01:56] <Aquaguy> is there any other way to do that
[17:02:10] <Aquaguy> without the fadeIn(0, ...) trick?
[17:03:26] <bailus> .show(function)?
[17:03:45] <Ganymede> Hmm...must mean that I'm not closing tags or something.
[17:03:47] <bailus> idk if show can run a callback though
[17:06:57] <shoky> got dc'd, donno if this got through:
[17:07:01] <shoky> Aquaguy: you can do  fadeIn(500).delay(3000).queue(function(next) { /* do smth */  next(); })
[17:07:21] <LindsayMac> has anyone done a snap to container on a vertical scroll? Is there a preferred plugin for it?
[17:08:19] <Aquaguy> shoky, that looks cleaner, thank you
[17:08:32] <shoky> LindsayMac i think many people like waypoints.js
[17:08:55] <shoky> jquery waypoints
[17:09:08] <LindsayMac> No i dont mean that... waypoints is something different.. i'm saying if I scroll between two divs, and I stop halfway, it snaps to the top
[17:09:19] <LindsayMac> shoky:  try here: http://www.twenty8twelve.com/
[17:09:32] <LindsayMac> scroll and leave the panels splitting the screen and you will see.
[17:10:54] <shoky> gotcha
[17:11:13] <LindsayMac> Just thinking it could stop some erratic users from being dopy..
[17:11:16] <bailus> thats a strange effect
[17:11:19] <bailus> don't know if like
[17:11:41] <shoky> it's alright
[17:11:53] <mfjordvald> Hmm. I have some js files that are loaded inside a modal window, any way to prevent jquery from applying a cache buster to them?
[17:11:55] <bailus> it would probably be good on a touch device
[17:12:16] <LindsayMac> shoky:  if you have a site that is dependent on people scrolling to a position, you can use anchor links and this..
[17:12:23] <LindsayMac> otherwise, as i said, people get wonky
[17:13:06] <LindsayMac> shoky:  i disabled the scrollbar for FF and other similar browsers but it seems like I can't get them disabled for Chrome / safari
[17:13:25] <shoky> disable?
[17:13:39] <LindsayMac> yea. They user can't use the mouse scroll
[17:13:41] <shoky> you disable scrollbars by not having overflow
[17:13:54] <LindsayMac> shoky:  yea.. i have html {overflow:hidden}
[17:13:56] <shoky> that sounds gross
[17:14:00] <LindsayMac> doesnt work in chrome/ie..
[17:15:00] <LindsayMac> Sorry i have overflow-y:hidden;
[17:15:56] <bailus> i think some browsers attach the scrollbar to the body element
[17:16:23] <LindsayMac> bailus:  huh?
[17:16:29] <LindsayMac> Ohh...
[17:16:47] <shoky> btw just cause there isn't a scrollbar doesn't mean i cant for example middle-click and then scroll like that
[17:16:55] <shoky> i often scroll with that
[17:17:15] <LindsayMac> shoky:  middle click? us mac people dont know that one
[17:17:20] <shoky> :P
[17:17:41] <shoky> i middle click, then the cursor turns special, and when i move my mouse in any direction, the view scrolls in that direction
[17:17:46] <shoky> until i middle-click again to disable it
[17:18:00] <shoky> and that works even if there's no scrollbar
[17:18:10] <min|dvir|us> Hi. Is there any way to add a static CSS rule, like in CSS files, that does not require the element to already exist?
[17:18:10] <bailus> so does mouse wheel
[17:18:15] <shoky> not always
[17:18:19] <LindsayMac> bailus:  it seems that adding overflow:hidden to the body doesnt change the mouse scroll either
[17:18:53] <LindsayMac> basically want to disable ANY manual scrolling cross browsers. I THOUGHT that would be the easy part!
[17:19:09] <Aquaguy> one more question. if a elemnt has a queue, and you want to call .fadeOut('fast') when pressing a button is there any way to execute that .fadeOut() immediately and not wait for the queue
[17:19:10] <Aquaguy> ?
[17:19:10] <shoky> LindsayMac: is there maybe another container element that has the scrollbar?
[17:20:27] <LindsayMac> shoky:  ill add it to the wrapper to see
[17:20:43] <LindsayMac> nope..
[17:20:45] <mfjordvald> So the cache buster when dynamically including scripts is affected by jQuery.ajaxSetup({ cache: true });, which is weird but that's how to fix it for reference.
[17:20:50] <Aquaguy> doesn't mind, just found clearQueue
[17:21:12] <LindsayMac> there's only three elements that contain all of the divs that hodl the content.. <html><body><div id=#page"> and adding overflow:hidden to all of them does nada
[17:22:00] <shoky> got a link/fiddle?
[17:22:28] <LindsayMac> shoky:  I can give you a link to the site, just need IP to give you access.. or give me a few mintes to try and make a fiddle
[17:24:04] <shoky> (noticed you the ip)
[17:24:26] <LindsayMac> shoky:  got it
[17:25:12] <LindsayMac> shoky:  just PMed you the link
[17:25:36] <LindsayMac> you can also see how I am using that script from earlier
[17:26:46] <shoky> no scrollbar here
[17:26:55] <LindsayMac> shoky:  but can you mouse scroll?
[17:27:08] <shoky> not with the wheel. with the middle-click thing tho, yea
[17:27:38] <LindsayMac> shoky:  are you on windows/mac? and what browser
[17:27:52] <shoky> win7 chrome
[17:28:05] <LindsayMac> So it must be a mac chrome thing?
[17:28:19] <shoky> dunno
[17:28:38] <LindsayMac> strange
[17:28:53] <LindsayMac> I cant freakin get chrome on my computer so I cant even test that well
[17:31:24] <shoky> it looks fine in chrome mac too here
[17:31:32] <shoky> (got osx VM)
[17:31:41] <LindsayMac> really?? you can't scroll with mouse?
[17:31:44] <LindsayMac> strange!!!
[17:31:46] <shoky> ya
[17:32:08] <LindsayMac> Hmm.. I can scroll on Safari and figured the two were the same issue.
[17:32:49] <LindsayMac> I think maybe its because they are using a beta or bleeding edge version?
[17:33:03] <LindsayMac> it was two devs who looked at it... and they were the two who could scroll... its so odd
[17:33:52] <shoky> its fine in safari too
[17:34:02] <shoky> except for the internal custom scrollbars not showing up
[17:34:21] <shoky> i'm on snow leopard tho
[17:34:45] <LindsayMac> shoky:  on my safari the internal custom scrollers show!
[17:34:54] <LindsayMac> and on my safari, I can scroll with my mouse
[17:35:05] <shoky> ;p
[17:35:23] <LindsayMac> WHY DOESNT MY LIFE WORK OUT LIKE ITS SUPPOSED TO!
[17:35:39] <LindsayMac> I thought i had accounted for most browser issues...
[17:38:46] <min|dvir|us> Hi. Is there any way to add a static CSS rule, like in CSS files, that does not require the element to already exist?
[17:39:29] <shoky> min|dvir|us: how do you do it when the element already exists? (trying to understand what you mean)
[17:39:57] <coldhead> $('<style />').text('.someClass {some: rule}').appendTo('head')
[17:39:57] <b-ot> coldhead, you have one new message, say â€œreadâ€ to me when you wish to read it.
[17:40:04] <coldhead> oh thanks b-ot
[17:46:57] <Parhs> http://parhs.no-ip.org/
[17:47:28] <Parhs> there is 1px gap between menu and slideshow in chrome only
[17:47:50] <Parhs> but if you select with mouse something there to force redraw it is fine..
[17:48:00] <Parhs> or if page has scrollbars if fine too
[17:52:41] <azbyin> hi all..
[17:52:55] <azbyin> I have a strange thing happening..
[17:53:07] <azbyin> i'm unable to select an element by its id!
[17:53:23] <azbyin> fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/ZeDWa/
[17:54:08] <Parhs> lets c++
[17:54:47] <Parhs> where is tha problem?
[17:54:54] <Parhs> you forgot #  i guess
[17:54:56] <mfjordvald> azbyin: use #OpenLayers?
[17:55:29] <azbyin> sorry i made a hurried paste and forgot the #.,. i'm updating it
[17:55:38] <mfjordvald> And I think the . might be tripping you up as well, since it's standard CSS selectors, right?
[17:56:25] <azbyin> http://jsfiddle.net/ZeDWa/1/
[17:58:56] <shoky> azbyin: $('#a.b.c') looks for id 'a' with classes 'b' and 'c'
[17:58:58] <Parhs> maybe dot is the problem
[17:59:14] <Parhs> replace them with _
[18:00:31] <shoky> jquery docs say: If you wish to use any of the meta-characters ( such as !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\.
[18:01:06] <shoky> azbyin ^
[18:01:16] <shoky> $("#OpenLayers\\.Control\\.LayerSwitcher_24_input_Medium")  works

[18:06:25] <coldhead> eschew periods in classnames, for the love of god
[18:08:45] <Roundaround> hey all.  I'm back with another animation problem.
[18:09:20] <coldhead> oh god
[18:10:33] <Roundaround> heh, so I'm trying to load content using AJAX through the .load function
[18:10:51] <Roundaround> and ideally, I would like it to animate while doing it
[18:11:34] <johnkpaul> Roundaround: animate what?
[18:11:48] <Roundaround> a content div
[18:12:16] <Roundaround> I tried animating a hide, loading, then animating a show, but the containing div (which shink-wraps the content) doesn't update it's size until AFTER the show animation completes
[18:12:35] <Roundaround> so it will animate to the old size, then immediately snap back
[18:12:58] <johnkpaul> oh Roundaround, you want to animate to "auto", which isn't straightfowrad at all
[18:13:07] <johnkpaul> there are many hacks around this problem
[18:13:10] <johnkpaul> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5003220/javascript-jquery-animate-to-auto-height
[18:13:25] <jsnoob> is there a method i can use on a jquery object to refresh the object?
[18:13:54] <johnkpaul> jsnoob: what does refresh the object mea
[18:13:56] <johnkpaul> mean*
[18:14:32] <Roundaround> jsnoob: if you're referring to refreshing a page or iframe, no
[18:14:34] <jsnoob> i mean if i do var container = $("#container"); and then i do container.html("poop"), container is now out of date johnkpaul
[18:14:44] <snover> wut
[18:14:45] <b-ot> Hi, You may add "ajax history" future to jQuery. Best regards.
[18:14:58] <johnkpaul> jsnoob: what does out of date mean?
[18:15:28] <jsnoob> it references old dom that's now been changed
[18:15:39] <johnkpaul> jsnoob: in your example, no, it doesn't
[18:16:03] <jsnoob> johnkpaul: well, if i had
[18:16:20] <johnkpaul> if you had what, that's what I'm trying to find out
[18:16:21] <jsnoob> is there a method to refresh it? or no because idk what selector was used for it
[18:16:38] <johnkpaul> oh, you want the selector of a selection? $().selector
[18:16:45] <Roundaround> johnkpaul: I'm not sure that SO question quite applies, unless the auto height is determined while the element is hidden
[18:16:52] <johnkpaul> jsnoob: $(".className").selector ==".className"
[18:17:06] <johnkpaul> Roundaround: it is determined while the element is off page
[18:17:25] <johnkpaul> Roundaround: position:absolute;left:-99999px
[18:17:30] <Roundaround> ah
[18:17:31] <jsnoob> johnkpaul: i'll give it a shot, thanks man. sorry if i'm acting retarded, i'm hitting close to 12 hours today
[18:17:32] <johnkpaul> it really is a hack :)
[18:18:01] <Roundaround> lol johnkpaul it's so jank
[18:18:08] <johnkpaul> jsnoob: that's ok, go get some sleep after this, you don't write good code when you're falling asleep
[18:18:12] <johnkpaul> Roundaround: :D jank, yes, I know
[18:18:21] <coldhead> you write good poetry in that state, give that a shot
[18:18:28] <Roundaround> ^
[18:18:34] <jsnoob> :D
[18:18:45] <Roundaround> you don't even know what you write until the next morning, either
[18:19:04] <Roundaround> worked with my college papers freshman and sophomore year
[18:19:13] <johnkpaul> sounds like a night of too much drinking rather than college papers to me
[18:19:17] <Roundaround> lol
[18:21:21] <jsnoob> that morning that you look through your code and just go "Ugh"
[18:22:37] <abjorn> coldhead: hai
[18:22:46] <abjorn> aw imsky isnt around anymore
[18:22:48] <abjorn> he was earlier

[18:24:32] <abjorn> there are too many bots around here
[18:24:56] <Roundaround> wait, is LindsayMac a bot?
[18:25:29] <LindsayMac> Yes I am.
[18:25:38] <Roundaround> :3
[18:26:00] <Roundaround> just not sure where the too many bots thing came from
[18:26:19] <johnkpaul> because we're all bots deep down Roundaround
[18:26:20] <LindsayMac> haha yea. I am not a bot but I do flash boobs when I see the words Strip Club automatically.
[18:26:23] <abjorn> coldhead: I have exciting news
[18:26:41] <Roundaround> LindsayMac: you just did it perfectly after the face/arms
[18:26:47] <abjorn> those were some funny looking boobs
[18:26:49] <LindsayMac> Roundaround:  hahah i know!
[18:26:54] <abjorn> ( . Y . )
[18:26:55] <LindsayMac> abjorn:  those were perfect boobs
[18:27:06] <abjorn> those areolas were the size of plates
[18:27:06] <LindsayMac> hahaha.. those are pam anderson boobs
[18:27:15] <LindsayMac> thats sexxxxxy
[18:27:27] <abjorn> L2ASCIIPORN
[18:27:30] <LindsayMac> ( 0 )( 0 ) <~~~ They're watching you!
[18:27:34] <abjorn> motherofgod
[18:28:16] <LindsayMac> ok so i'm trying to rethinking some logic and can use some help...
[18:28:23] <LindsayMac> if yall dont mind..
[18:28:32] <LindsayMac> i'll flash more boobs if ya help
[18:28:47] <abjorn> that is not necessary
[18:29:07] <coldhead> what is the news, abjsy
[18:29:20] <LindsayMac> I have a script that initiates a specific animation on two other elements when one element comes into the viewport via vertical scrolling..
[18:29:32] <coldhead> something about quail eggs and immortality?
[18:29:50] <abjorn> i will pm it to you
[18:29:59] <LindsayMac> so if i scroll down a page, when my <h1 id="animateit"> comes in to view it triggers <div id+whitebox"> to expand height
[18:30:19] <LindsayMac> (that should be = not + )
[18:31:08] <LindsayMac> Then when it goes out of view the #whitebox) height will collapse again..
[18:31:10] <LindsayMac> follow?
[18:31:13] <abjorn> sec
[18:31:27] <LindsayMac> k
[18:31:38] <abjorn> yeah, go on
[18:32:15] <LindsayMac> ok.. So the issue is that there is a long way from the top of the screen (where the <h1> rests when you stop on that page) to the bottom of the page, thus not trigging the out animation soon enough
[18:32:52] <LindsayMac> The in animation expands the height of #whitebox and fades in the contents of #panel1 and the out just undoes those two things
[18:33:58] <LindsayMac> So right now i'm using the edges of the viewport to trigger all this, and while it's good for the top side, its not for the bottom... And REALLY what I want to do is trigger it based on the next navigation link that you click..
[18:34:11] <LindsayMac> So i am thinking.. and this is where wrestling with teh logic comes in to play...
[18:34:47] <TorpedoSkyline> Maximus
[18:34:50] <LindsayMac> trigger the animation when the <h1> comes in to view and then "undo" the animation when I click on any of the hash links that brings me to the next container element
[18:34:55] <TorpedoSkyline> lol sorry wrong channel. XD
[18:35:09] <LindsayMac> thats it! THATS THE ANSWER TO ALL MY QUESTIONS!
[18:35:13] <abjorn> rofl
[18:35:15] <abjorn> i was about to say
[18:35:15] <LindsayMac> it was Maximus all along!
[18:35:30] <abjorn> anyways, whats the problem with that, lindsay?
[18:35:42] <LindsayMac> the problem with me new logic?
[18:36:00] <abjorn> yeah
[18:36:23] <LindsayMac> Well 1) I need to relearn a lot again.. so I am not entirely sure where to start...
[18:36:38] <LindsayMac> 2) there are other hash links on the page that I do NOT want triggering that animation at all...
[18:36:55] <LindsayMac> so being new to this, and this site in itself being a learning experience.. i am .. well.. a little lost and looking for direction
[18:37:04] <LindsayMac> I also wanted to make sure my logic made sense to someone else
[18:37:18] <abjorn> so apply a class to hash links that should trigger it and select only those to apply that event handler on
[18:37:18] <Math-> What can be the reason of $("something"). not working, but jQuery("something") works?
[18:37:36] <LindsayMac> ok yea. duh. I should have known that.
[18:37:36] <abjorn> $ was replaced with something else
[18:37:39] <abjorn> happens sometimes, Math-
[18:37:48] <abjorn> check if jQuery === $
[18:38:11] <Math-> abjorn, false :(
[18:38:12] <LindsayMac> So now I need to look and see how to trigger my animation with a click instead of via the browser.. AND how to stop the browser viewport code from triggering the 'out' function
[18:38:14] <abjorn> but that's easily remedied if you wrap your code in an IIFE
[18:38:33] <abjorn> (function (window, $) { /* your code here */ }(window, window.jQuery));
[18:38:52] <Math-> but the strange thing is that $ is "undefined"
[18:38:59] <abjorn> yeah that happens
[18:39:10] <abjorn> another script is probably calling jQuery.noConflict();
[18:39:35] <coldhead> try jQuery.moreConflict();
[18:39:43] <abjorn> lol
[18:39:56] <Parhs> lol
[18:40:10] <LindsayMac> jQuery.terrorist
[18:40:20] <LindsayMac> that works for me..
[18:40:24] <abjorn> jQuery.missileCrisis()
[18:40:38] <LindsayMac> great.. now you got big brother watching us. Good job!
[18:40:39] <Parhs> monkey eater
[18:43:19] <RandyW>  Anybody know aught about the new Mario van Peebles movie "Red Sky" coming out next year?
[18:44:09] <LindsayMac> abjorn: if you have a moment.. this is the code I have right now for the in/out http://jsfiddle.net/tfqnH/
[18:44:21] <abjorn> the ol' in out
[18:44:30] <LindsayMac> it is not my code, and i've been trying to dissect it for a while but i dont fully get it..
[18:44:31] <LindsayMac> lol abjorn
[18:44:36] <LindsayMac> everyone needs a good pump
[18:44:54] <abjorn> whoever formatted this javascript is my worst enemy
[18:45:07] <LindsayMac> ANYWAYS.. to get me started.. clearly I need to do away with the "out" part so I can simply trigger the other out
[18:45:11] <LindsayMac> pachet
[18:45:33] <abjorn> I say...start fresh because this code stinks!
[18:45:45] <LindsayMac> okee dokee..
[18:45:52] <LindsayMac> have any thoughts as to where I can start?
[18:46:09] <LindsayMac> i'm gonna toss up my animation code in a min so you can see the whole idea/
[18:46:18] <abjorn> with the scroll in, i would guess
[18:47:03] <abjorn> I've actually never done scrolling animations stuff before. Mostly cause lazy
[18:48:08] <LindsayMac> I dunno if this would be considered a "scrolling animation"
[18:48:15] <LindsayMac> not in the way scrollarama does it
[18:48:40] <abjorn> well, scrolling stuffz
[18:49:17] <abjorn> also, http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/ ARE YOU GUYS READY?
[18:49:44] <LindsayMac> You have no idea! we;ve been dying to see it
[18:50:14] <coldhead> zomg zomg zomg
[18:50:23] <coldhead> the most convoluted landing ever
[18:50:53] <abjorn> YEEEAAH
[18:51:01] <abjorn> http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/nasatv/ they've started steaming sum shit
[18:51:04] <coldhead> "after twirling gracefully to the end of its tethers the rover will somersault to the ground whilst jugglling"
[18:51:31] <abjorn> man this sounds like a bad science video we would've watched in the 90s when i was a kid
[18:51:36] <abjorn> sounds and looks
[18:52:07] <LindsayMac> hahaha
[18:52:29] <LindsayMac> its so sad how bad they are with web tech!
[18:53:15] <abjorn> theyve got more important things to code in cobol
[18:53:18] <coldhead> earthbound web tech is what they're trying to get away from
[18:55:06] <abjorn> omg omg omg
[18:55:07] <abjorn> captain kirk
[18:55:10] <abjorn> is on the stream
[18:58:03] <azbyin> thanks shoky..  had to go off for a meeting abruptly
[19:00:50] <Roundaround> johnkpaul: you still there?
[19:02:43] <coldhead> he's definitely still somewhere
[19:03:22] <Roundaround> lol
[19:10:51] <tw2113> hey-oh!
[19:11:03] <LindsayMac> phew ok... if any of you are around.. maybe abjorn .. here is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/tfqnH/4/
[19:12:35] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  is here.. all is well now!
[19:12:55] <tw2113> *gets out his autograph book* where? where?
[19:13:08] <LindsayMac> lol
[19:13:26] <LindsayMac> abjorn: you around???
[19:15:17] <Roundaround> ack what is this craziness
[19:15:39] <Roundaround> lol
[19:15:40] <LindsayMac> Roundaround:  haha.. it is the craziness that I am trying desperately to simplify
[19:15:55] <Roundaround> I haven't been paying attention.  what exactly are you trying to do?
[19:16:00] <LindsayMac> i didn't bother tryingt  o make it look pretty in the fiddle.. just showing functionality.
[19:16:37] <azbyin> i like pane3 kitchen :)
[19:16:39] <LindsayMac> ok.. I have those divs stacked on top of each other and I actually have a smoother scroll (scrollto) included in my actual site.. you click the links up top and are scrolled to the container you need..
[19:17:02] <LindsayMac> So when you get to the container you clicked to, the content fades in and the white box comes down
[19:17:43] <Roundaround> hm
[19:18:02] <Roundaround> okay I get it
[19:18:06] <Roundaround> so what's wrong with it?
[19:18:08] <LindsayMac> Roundaround:  right now i'm using the viewport to know when the <h1> tag comes in.. and it works whne scrollong down....
[19:18:31] <LindsayMac> but when you are going up, since the <h1> tag is at the top, the white box doesnt close until you are almost into the other container
[19:18:36] <LindsayMac> I want it to close right away
[19:18:58] <Roundaround> ahh I see
[19:19:13] <Roundaround> so any time the <h1> tag is not at or near the top?
[19:19:22] <LindsayMac> yes
[19:19:29] <Roundaround> try using offsetTOp instead
[19:19:41] <LindsayMac> instead of?
[19:19:48] <LindsayMac> instead of all the viewport stuff?
[19:20:27] <Roundaround> right.  offsettop will give you the pixel length between the top of your <h1> tag and the content window (ie viewport)
[19:20:36] <LindsayMac> ahhh..
[19:20:43] <LindsayMac> why weren't you here last week!?
[19:21:04] <Roundaround> lol because I only recently started working with jquery :3
[19:21:16] <tw2113> jquery or js in general Roundaround ?
[19:21:22] <Roundaround> jquery
[19:21:29] <Roundaround> I've been using js for years
[19:21:34] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[19:21:35] * rmill does a little dance here too
[19:21:44] <tw2113> your first day is next month coldhead
[19:21:47] <tw2113> you're just ambitious
[19:22:14] <rmill> it's been coldhead's first day using jQuery for a great many days.
[19:22:20] <coldhead> i want the scheduled first day to go well
[19:22:24] <coldhead> this is a little prep work
[19:23:18] <LindsayMac> Roundaround:  I am going to play with your idea and see where I land. I am entirely new to JS as a whole.. so this is all new to me
[19:23:55] <Roundaround> gotcha.  yeah, I needed to use offsettop when working with some jquery ui dialogs
[19:24:15] <coldhead> you're doing great, LindsayMac
[19:24:24] <Roundaround> ^^
[19:24:31] <LindsayMac> lol... i'm assuming that's sarcastic
[19:24:36] <Roundaround> mm no>
[19:24:38] <Roundaround> ?
[19:24:53] <LindsayMac> well because I feel like an IDIOT when working with this stuff
[19:25:03] <Roundaround> haha it will be that was for a while
[19:25:08] <Roundaround> don't worry ;)
[19:25:21] <Roundaround> but it wouldn't help to format the code a little better
[19:25:38] <LindsayMac> what's wrong with the code formatting?
[19:25:43] <LindsayMac> lol
[19:26:05] <LindsayMac> I do php... so i dunno.. js... ?
[19:26:50] <Roundaround> well for starters try not to do multiline var declaration with only one 'var'
[19:26:53] <azbyin> do(php) { ... } until(dunno(js)); ?
[19:26:56] <azbyin> :p
[19:27:14] <Roundaround> its a bit confusing where that execution line actually starts and ends
[19:27:55] <LindsayMac> Roundaround:  which in particular are you talking about?
[19:28:04] <LindsayMac> i am more than happy to learn best practices here
[19:28:06] <Roundaround> the one right there at the top :P
[19:28:11] <Roundaround> secondly, try to limit your lines to about 100-120 characters.  anything more and you either create side-scrolling or word wrap, depending on the editor window
[19:28:27] <LindsayMac> Yea.. i def. know that should be cleaned up
[19:28:31] <Roundaround> :P
[19:28:37] <Roundaround> see, you're not so bad ;)
[19:28:37] <LindsayMac> but the tracked_elements
[19:28:46] <LindsayMac> ?? that one you dont like?
[19:28:50] <Roundaround> nope
[19:29:08] <Roundaround> you should only group basic vars of the same datatype together
[19:29:16] <Roundaround> ie numbers or strings
[19:29:27] <LindsayMac> see thats where you loose me again..
[19:29:32] <Roundaround> and it should never span more than one line
[19:29:57] <LindsayMac> sorry i'm being dense right now. Could you take one of themore "offensive' lines and re-structure so I can see?
[19:29:57] <Roundaround> well like this:  "var i=0, f=1.2;"
[19:30:01] <Roundaround> is acceptable
[19:30:05] <coldhead> how you group your vars is a matter of taste, Roundaround
[19:30:14] <coldhead> don't pontificate about that :)
[19:30:33] <Roundaround> coldhead: perhaps, but the biggest thing is the multiline on one var declaration
[19:30:36] <LindsayMac> I dont see putting them on the same line as being beneficial to me
[19:30:45] <LindsayMac> I still dont know what you mean by that
[19:31:13] <Roundaround> LindsayMac: then put 'var' on each new line instead of grouping them all into the same line of code
[19:31:40] <Roundaround> each 'line' should have it's own 'var' and semicolon
[19:31:48] <coldhead> put them on as many lines as required to make them readable and correct
[19:32:26] <Roundaround> of course, as coldhead said, that's personal preference, but this is what I see most often and I think it's more readable
[19:32:27] <LindsayMac> yea.. i still dont know what I did wrong var $windowHeight = b;ahh b;ah
[19:32:30] <LindsayMac> is on one line
[19:32:46] <LindsayMac> then var $collapsedBox = kjshdfsk
[19:32:49] <LindsayMac> is on another
[19:33:52] <LindsayMac> in other news.. did you see this? http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/interactives/edlcuriosity/index-2.html
[19:34:41] <Roundaround> okay, like the part with trackedElements
[19:34:42] <LindsayMac> Quick question in regards to offset.top ...
[19:34:48] <Roundaround> this is what I mean : http://jsfiddle.net/Roundaround/5gCQZ/
[19:35:08] <LindsayMac> Does it look for closest to the top of the browser window, or top of the whole page?
[19:35:13] <LindsayMac> i'm assuming browser window..
[19:35:41] <LindsayMac> ahh so you dont like var </br> tracked_elements
[19:35:43] <LindsayMac> i see
[19:35:47] <Roundaround> browser window, I believe.  though when I used it the two were always one in the same
[19:36:00] <LindsayMac> Roundaround:  yea.. thats what scares me.
[19:36:21] <Roundaround> how so?
[19:36:42] <LindsayMac> because its very possible its not relative to the window at all and only it's containing elemnt
[19:37:05] <Roundaround> well, it can't hurt to try and see :)
[19:37:19] <LindsayMac> haha i know.. i'm trying now
[19:37:41] <Roundaround> i find half of coding is testing incomplete code :P
[19:38:14] <LindsayMac> yup..
[19:38:25] <LindsayMac> but this particular code has been keeping me up late at night.. wanting to kill peopl e
[19:39:10] <tw2113> *cowers in the corner*
[19:40:06] <Roundaround> lol it's okay.  I've been wrestling with my custom tabbed interface code for 4 days now with no real progress
[19:40:25] <Roundaround> I mean, it works, but not entirely the way I'd like
[19:40:26] <LindsayMac> are you using jquery UI tabs?
[19:40:30] <Roundaround> nah
[19:40:33] <LindsayMac> because they are a PAIN!
[19:40:55] <Roundaround> mhm I tried initially, but I would have to rewrite them so much it wasn't worth it
[19:41:30] <LindsayMac> yea thats hwy i dont like them either. Not flexible
[19:41:46] <Roundaround> mhm
[19:41:52] <Roundaround> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18165213/RoundaroundTechnologies/index.html
[19:42:01] <Roundaround> That there took me 4 days to make and it's still glitchy
[19:42:36] <LindsayMac> whats glitchy?
[19:43:24] <Roundaround> the height at the end of the animation
[19:43:55] <Roundaround> it animates to the height of the previous page then snaps to the new height
[19:44:18] <LindsayMac> ahhh..
[19:45:37] <Roundaround> and I cand find a workaround.  johnkpaul_ showed me one earlier and it was...jank
[19:45:43] <Roundaround> and I couldn't get it to work right
[19:45:51] <Roundaround> can't*
[19:48:42] <LindsayMac> hmm.. i actually got pretty good at dealing with animations and height calc.
[19:48:50] <LindsayMac> I might be able to help, but i need to work out this window top issue first
[19:51:36] <Roundaround> np
[19:51:58] <Roundaround> I may not always be on here though, because IRC connections are blocked at work
[19:52:05] <krz> what version of js is query using?
[19:52:08] <krz> jquery*
[19:52:26] <Roundaround> I can pm you my email if you want it though, LindsayMac
[19:52:32] <LindsayMac> sure..
[19:52:57] <Roundaround> krz: version of js?  there's no such thing...
[19:53:00] <tw2113> you mean which ECMA?
[19:53:08] <Roundaround> ^^
[19:53:18] <krz> yea
[19:53:21] <chaohuanghong> have someone try this code don't work in chrome and ie, but firefox is ok.
[19:53:21] <chaohuanghong> jQ(bubbleArrow).css("border-left-width")
[19:53:30] <krz> 1.0.4?
[19:56:08] <Roundaround> chaohuanghong: that syntax doesn't make sense to me.  particularly jQ(bubbleArrow)
[19:56:46] <chaohuanghong> jquery version is 1.4.2
[19:57:12] <chaohuanghong> i got your mind, just wait
[19:58:05] <Roundaround> wait, what?
[19:58:16] <Roundaround> you got my mind?
[20:02:04] <coldhead> he understands
[20:02:10] <coldhead> he understands your mind
[20:06:29] <coldhead> you release you
[20:07:30] <LindsayMac> Does anything here jump out at you as being ENTIRELY wrong?   if( $('#panel4 h1').offset().top <= 25 ) {
[20:08:43] <Haemp> Looks alright to me
[20:08:53] <Haemp> What error does it give?
[20:09:14] <LindsayMac> No error.. it just doesnt initiate the animation when i am "there"
[20:09:23] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/1/
[20:09:26] <LindsayMac> dont mind the mess.
[20:09:32] <tw2113> current irk: people who set layers to multiply to get rid of white bgs
[20:09:35] <Haemp> :)
[20:10:00] <LindsayMac> hahah
[20:11:16] <min|dvir|us> Is there any way to statically apply CSS, without regard to whether the selector actually matches, like regular CSS documents?
[20:11:37] <LindsayMac> huh?
[20:12:06] <min|dvir|us> $('.class').css(options); // requires .class to match something to apply CSS rules
[20:12:42] <LindsayMac> min|dvir|us:  you can use just div or ul
[20:12:44] <azbyin> $('body').css({...});
[20:13:01] <azbyin> min|dvir|us, ^^
[20:13:01] <min|dvir|us> azbyin: I still want to match a specific selector.
[20:13:24] <LindsayMac> So anyone have an idea why this isnt triggering the animation when the offset <= 25?? http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/Etsze/1/
[20:13:32] <azbyin> huh? you want it to match a selector and apply some css, but if it doesn;t match you apply the css to *what*?
[20:14:03] <min|dvir|us> azbyin: the elements that are added to the DOM at a later point.
[20:14:24] <azbyin> what? then you apply css to them when you add them!
[20:14:49] <min|dvir|us> azbyin: I don't want to do that every time like I wouldn't have to with a .css file.
[20:15:44] <LindsayMac> min|dvir|us:  you need to tell teh code what to do.. you need to either tell it to apply .myclass to every div on the page, or every div within another div id=#myid or something else
[20:15:59] <min|dvir|us> LindsayMac: not following.
[20:15:59] <azbyin> you can listen for DOM mutations (deprecated already! but still not implemented across all browsers)  or you setup mutation observers (which is again too new and not implemented across all browsers!)
[20:16:15] <min|dvir|us> azbyin: that's still the same thing.
[20:16:28] <azbyin> exactly! that is what i am saying
[20:16:39] <azbyin> you apply css when you add elements
[20:16:59] <azbyin> unless you don;t have control of when/who/how elements are added to the dom
[20:17:02] <min|dvir|us> Screw it, I'll just add a .css file.
[20:17:57] <azbyin> min|dvir|us, you do realise that you can do:  $("<div/>", { css: {... } }).appendTo('body')  right?
[20:18:07] <azbyin> i.e. you can set the css when you are adding the element
[20:18:44] <min|dvir|us> azbyin: no, but that is cool.
[20:19:30] <LindsayMac> alrighty well i'm out. Hopeuflly will work this out tomorrow.
[20:21:53] <chaohuanghong> hi, Roundaround , see the code
[20:21:54] <chaohuanghong> http://jsfiddle.net/YcaJQ/1/
[20:22:31] <chaohuanghong> the border-left-width can't display
[20:23:51] <wingy> can anyone figure out why this slider example wont work? http://plunker.no.de/edit/ud3dXZ?live=preview
[20:24:17] <wingy> i copied it directly from http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[20:24:28] <wingy> Range Slider demo
[20:24:47] <min|dvir|us> wingy: did you open your console?
[20:25:06] <min|dvir|us> wingy: first step to solving problems is opening your console.
[20:26:31] <wingy> http://plunker.no.de/edit/ud3dXZ?live=preview
[20:26:47] <wingy> i reordered the scripts so that problem was gone .. but it wasn't the main issue
[20:27:04] <ysael> wingy it worked in firefox
[20:27:54] <wingy> doesn't work for me in FF
[20:30:38] <wingy> i suspect it's the versions
[20:33:26] <wingy> nope it wasn't
[20:36:46] <coldhead> ?nopm @ chaohuanghong

[20:38:17] <wingy> ok now this is scary: http://plunker.no.de/edit/ud3dXZ?live=preview
[20:38:30] <wingy> can't be more simple than that, cant figure out what the problem is
[20:38:36] <wingy> anyone?
[20:39:06] <wingy> looking at the DOM it has actually created the slider but it's invisible
[20:42:23] <wingy> dah
[20:42:28] <wingy> needed the css resource
[20:42:45] <coldhead> great work wingy, take five
[20:43:11] <wingy> i see that you were just roflmao
[20:43:48] <wingy> high five for humanity
[21:17:39] <coldhead> no chaohuanghong, you can use ?attr
[21:17:40] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[21:18:44] <azbyin> coldhead, http://jsfiddle.net/uzbCa/
[21:19:18] <azbyin> is there a reason jquery is returning opposite state only for the automated click?
[21:19:29] <azbyin> it works fine for regular mouse interaction.
[21:21:40] <coldhead> azbyin: it looks like the native handling is occuring first, then the handler
[21:22:09] <coldhead> see if it works any differently with change() instead of click() maybe?
[21:24:30] <azbyin> coldhead, yup.. works fine with change instead of click
[21:24:33] <azbyin> thanks
[21:31:27] <azbyin> coldhead, still doesn't work in 1.5.1 works in 1.5.2, so i guess this was definitely a bug

[22:27:34] <min|dvir|us> azbyin: do you have documentation for your claim?
[22:27:36] <min|dvir|us> [23:17] <azbyin> min|dvir|us, you do realise that you can do:  $("<div/>", { css: {... } }).appendTo('body')  right?
[22:29:23] <AfroTurf> can you set what the maximum value is for the ui progress bar. or is math necessary if the max value is not 100?
[22:30:40] <azbyin> min|dvir|us, err.. did you try it out?
