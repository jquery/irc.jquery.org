[00:02:25] <Lebbe> $('*').each(function() {$(this).attr('class', '').attr('onclick', '')}).off('click').click(function(e) {e.stopImmediatePropagation(); return false;});
[00:04:39] <prohobo> lebbe what's that
[00:05:13] <Lebbe> it is a cleaner
[00:05:34] <prohobo> for my problem?
[00:05:47] <Lebbe> it will solve most of your problems
[00:06:03] <prohobo> when does it trigger? when the mouse goes off the parent container?
[00:06:17] <Lebbe> it just prevents all clicks at all
[00:06:21] <prohobo> lol
[00:06:22] <Lebbe> and removes all style classes
[00:06:32] <Lebbe> I have a better version soon
[00:07:06] <prohobo> why
[00:09:07] <Lebbe> $('*').each(function() {for(attr in this) if(isNaN(+attr)) $(this).attr(attr, '')}).off('click').click(function(e) {e.stopImmediatePropagation(); return false;});
[00:09:10] <Lebbe> there
[00:11:22] <prohobo> are you hating on me or something?
[00:11:41] <Lebbe> this has nothing to do with your question
[00:11:56] <prohobo> alright, i thought you were trying to say i should just quit
[00:12:01] <Lebbe> haha
[00:12:02] <Lebbe> no
[00:12:11] <Lebbe> I just want to make the ultimate cleaner
[00:14:26] <aways> Hi
[00:21:31] <Lebbe> okauy, this is the last version, promise
[00:21:33] <Lebbe> $('*').each(function() {for(attr in this) if(isNaN(+attr)) $(this).attr(attr, ''); $(this).attr('class', '')}).off('click').click(function(e) {e.stopImmediatePropagation(); return false;}).show();
[00:21:40] <Lebbe> just to make sure we are not hiding anything away
[00:22:34] <Uhkis> if that's cleaner.. :D
[00:23:35] <Uhkis> oh, it's A cleaner
[00:23:40] <Lebbe> some day i'll make a non-jquery version, so you don't have to download a large library to clean the page
[00:24:41] <Uhkis> ultimate cleaner: $('html').html('');
[00:25:17] <Lebbe> I don't want to remove information
[00:25:24] <Lebbe> just styling and javascript events
[00:30:17] <prohobo> can someone look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/p2d00ms7/
[00:30:44] <prohobo> if you drag the left handle of the right-most range selector to the left-most range selector, the freaking thing moves over to it
[00:30:48] <prohobo> i have no idea why
[00:31:15] <prohobo> i know the code ain't pretty...
[00:31:20] <prohobo> btw
[00:31:49] <lemonsparrow> join #chroe
[00:31:52] <lemonsparrow> join #chrome
[00:32:06] <prohobo> gotta use that /
[00:32:32] <Lebbe> perhaps he wants us to join #chrome
[00:32:54] <lemonsparrow> yeah got it thanks
[00:33:15] <lemonsparrow> hi is there a work around or solution for the  Duplicate headers received from server error issue for chrome ? http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=136665
[00:33:26] <lemonsparrow> a work around in query perhaps :)
[00:33:37] <lemonsparrow> when you try downloading a file containing comma Ö this issue arise
[00:33:40] <lemonsparrow> only in chrome
[00:33:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork, you might know some fix for this :)
[00:34:55] <Cork> hmm?
[00:35:19] <Lebbe> you wont be able to fix that with javascript
[00:35:20] <Cork> why don't you just use jquery.slider?
[00:35:48] <Cork> or rather jqueryui-slider
[00:37:09] <prohobo> does the jqueryui-slider have range selection?
[00:37:16] <Cork> sure
[00:37:53] <prohobo> i need that click and drag by the middle functionality tho
[00:37:59] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/slider/#range
[00:38:24] <prohobo> and really the only problem i have with my slider is that it freaking snaps to other instances of itself somehow
[00:38:48] <Cork> prohobo: well you can drag to the left of it too
[00:38:57] <Cork> so ya, it has quite a bit of problems
[00:39:07] <prohobo> the left of it?
[00:39:21] <Cork> you can drag the handle to the 0px of the page
[00:39:27] <Lebbe> I think prohobo's slider is way funnier than jquery ui vaiant
[00:39:31] <Lebbe> *variant
[00:39:33] <Cork> and then go to the right of the slider and have 300% of the max range
[00:39:58] <prohobo> okay, yes.
[00:39:58] <Lebbe> yes if you drag the slider back again you can have like huuuge slider values
[00:40:00] <Lebbe> it is awesome
[00:40:27] <prohobo> unintentional feature
[00:40:37] <Lebbe> those are the best features :)
[00:41:07] <prohobo> well
[00:41:08] <Lebbe> why not use an existing widget or a html 5 slider?
[00:41:14] <Lebbe> is it some homework?
[00:41:29] <prohobo> no, i just wanted something i could use the way i wanted to
[00:41:45] <prohobo> i guess i'll try some already-made stuff
[00:48:56] <prohobo> god, other sliders are even worse
[00:51:52] <Cork> prohobo: what is the problem with jquery uis slider?
[00:52:05] <Cork> i've used it for years and hacked it to look and do most anything
[00:52:13] <Cork> it is a very flexible slider
[00:52:31] <prohobo> ill try it
[00:55:22] <prohobo> damn it, that's like 3 hours of coding and messing around for nothing
[01:14:05] <prohobo> how can i change jquery ui slider functionality without going into the original code?
[01:14:21] <prohobo> someone said something about a proxy function
[01:15:15] <Cork> prohobo: what functionality are you trying to change?
[01:15:35] <Cork> you can change most things either with options or by adding event handlers
[01:15:45] <prohobo> i want the same functionality as in my slider, where if you click on the actual range bar and drag, you move the entire selection along the rail
[01:16:45] <Cork> hmm
[01:16:51] <Cork> never tried to do that
[01:17:16] <Cork> you would prob want to bind a drag event handler on the range element
[01:17:22] <Cork> and move the sliders from that event
[01:17:33] <Cork> or rather slider('option') update the value of them
[01:18:07] <prohobo> yar, but it seems that if i click on the range element, one of the handles pops into place there - so i'd have to somehow override that
[01:19:09] <Cork> ah, true
[01:21:14] <Cork> prohobo: you could extend the slider and build your own
[01:21:31] <Cork> jquery ui uses the widget factory and it has a way to use a widget as a base
[01:21:33] <prohobo> im looking into that "widget factory" thing
[01:21:57] <prohobo> i guess i still have to dig in the original code to find the name of the method being called
[01:22:05] <Cork> annoyingly i can't find where the handle snap to mouse location happens
[01:22:12] <Cork> but i have fiddled with it my self too
[01:23:50] <Cork> ah, there it is
[01:23:53] <Cork> it happens in _mouseCapture
[01:24:22] <Cork> and ya, there is no option to disable that
[01:24:39] <Cork> might be a good feature to ask for
[01:24:58] <Cork> prohobo: but as of now, this might not be the best choice
[01:25:03] <Cork> did't know you needed that feature
[01:25:23] <prohobo> too late!
[01:28:26] <prohobo> "closestHandle
[01:28:26] <prohobo>    .addClass( "ui-state-active" )
[01:28:26] <prohobo>    .focus();"
[01:28:37] <prohobo> that looks like the moment it snaps to the mouse click
[01:30:00] <prohobo> nvm
[01:38:34] <hooligan321> wow that spectrum color picker is very compreshensive thanks for the heads up
[01:43:18] <hooligan321> defo dont need no "stinking images" when you got functionality like that
[01:44:17] <hooligan321> its funny i have heard images and javascript refered to as stinking on 1 night
[01:44:19] <hooligan321> lol
[01:45:51] <prohobo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5955343/drag-the-range-of-a-ui-input-range-slider/6095941#6095941
[01:45:58] <prohobo> range dragging for jquery ui slider
[01:46:28] <prohobo> looks like the guy just rewrote the entire function with modifications
[01:46:39] <Cork> prohobo: ooh, nice
[01:47:12] <Cork> prohobo: he rewrote the mouse actions with modifications
[01:47:18] <prohobo> o nvm, it's a proper extension
[01:47:22] <prohobo> i think
[01:48:02] <Cork> it is how you extend
[01:52:28] <NiGhTTraX> anybody know why I'm getting the following error in a node env? Cannot call methods on draggable prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'instance'
[01:53:00] <NiGhTTraX> using jquery-ui npm package 1.10.5
[01:54:42] <NiGhTTraX> I'm getting 'Error: no such method 'instance' for draggable widget instance'; has the method been removed?

[02:12:55] <uskerine> hi #jquery
[03:08:39] <frankallen> is there anyone using owl carousel?
[03:08:41] <frankallen> (v2)
[03:12:14] <tuskkk___> has anyone used, http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/ here?
[03:12:44] <tuskkk___> what would be the html for confirm password?
[03:12:46] <Cork> tuskkk___: it is commonly used
[03:13:10] <Cork> you mean an "enter again"?
[03:13:31] <tuskkk___> No, messaging if its not a match
[03:13:49] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[03:14:37] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to remember the name of an animation library. It's sole function was to replace jQuery's animate() method.
[03:14:39] <tuskkk___> like is there an HTML annotation like required, for the form?
[03:14:58] <Cork> tuskkk___: no
[03:15:00] <tuskkk___> for email, we have <input id="cemail" type="email" name="email" required/>
[03:15:10] <tuskkk___> so how do check if passwords match?
[03:15:12] <Cork> what is required is the attributes
[03:15:35] <tuskkk___> oh, so have to write that down in script?
[03:15:36] <Cork> you tell validator to do an emailConfirm with a second field
[03:16:35] <Cork> tuskkk___: sorry an equalTo
[03:16:38] <Cork> http://jqueryvalidation.org/equalTo-method/
[03:17:17] <tuskkk___> ah, thats what I need I guess, thanks Cork
[04:12:42] <tuskkk___> why isnt this code checking for equal passwords?

[04:57:23] <itry> Hello! New to jquery. I wonder why this is not adding the numbers correctly: http://jsfiddle.net/2760fgh3/
[04:59:25] <Horacsio> new question
[04:59:41] <Horacsio> I have this jquery scripts: http://jsfiddle.net/L7w49k0t/
[04:59:56] <Horacsio> that applyes to a form
[05:00:22] <Horacsio> How do I reset both functions with one button click?
[05:00:31] <unreal4u> itry: keydown is applied before you have entered a value
[05:00:53] <unreal4u> itry: use blur for example and it will work
[05:01:04] <unreal4u> itry: or keyup should also do the job
[05:01:40] <itry> unreal4u: blur only triggers when you live the input field, right?
[05:01:51] <unreal4u> leave, yes
[05:02:11] <itry> unreal4u: keyup works :)
[05:02:53] <itry> unreal4u: thanks!
[05:03:01] <unreal4u> yw
[05:04:02] <Horacsio> any help for me? :)
[05:04:59] <unreal4u> Horacsio: I have no idea, I'm not that good at javascript in general :)
[05:05:12] <Horacsio> thanks ;)
[05:05:47] <unreal4u> was just checking whether somebody had answered my question xD
[05:06:06] <itry> Horacsio: give us a working, minimal example and we will find the solution.
[05:06:19] <Uhkis> unreal4u: what was your question
[05:06:26] <unreal4u> Hi guys: does anyone know where I can find information about in what version an icon was added to this list? http://api.jquerymobile.com/icons/
[05:06:39] <Horacsio> Itry I gave the jquery functions :)
[05:07:53] <unreal4u> Uhkis: that's the one :) (forgot to mention you, had it in history)
[05:08:06] <Uhkis> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/css/themes/default/images/icons-png
[05:08:34] <unreal4u> Uhkis: I can work that out then, thanks!
[05:13:06] <AjitS> Hi Everyone
[05:14:31] <itry> AjitS: good morning
[05:16:22] <AjitS> Is there a way I create a JSON object using just the concate operator?
[05:16:34] <AjitS> itry: Its afternoon here :)
[05:17:20] <AjitS> I tried creating one..
[05:17:34] <AjitS> however it still treats it as string I suppose
[05:18:13] <Cork> AjitS: you can, but you should avoid it
[05:18:25] <itry> AjitS: here too. but i feel like its in the morning because i did not accomplish anything so far.
[05:18:27] <Cork> uh
[05:18:34] <Cork> json is a string by definition
[05:18:57] <Cork> AjitS: what exactly are you trying to do?
[05:19:48] <AjitS> Cork: I am trying to implement the Arktan widget
[05:19:57] <AjitS> http://arktan.com/product/arktan-social-streams/
[05:20:14] <Cork> i meant more why you are trying to generate json manually
[05:20:30] <Cork> just use JSON.stringify(object)
[05:32:43] <Ansikt> Hi.  On DOM ready, I bind mouseenter and mouseleave handlers to an element.  The problem is, if the user is already hovering on this element before DOMReady, the mouseenter handler doesn't fire.  Anyone know a solution to this?
[05:34:23] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/L7w49k0t/3/ somehow the plugins arent working but the ideia is to reset both functions when pressed "cancelar" light gray button.
[05:37:37] <Horacsio> I have the plugins working here: http://bias.baannng.com/#biascontact
[05:38:53] <Horacsio> itry: can you help now?
[05:38:59] <Kruptein> hi, I have a problem that if I move my mouse rapid between the text and the image, the original text wont reappear. http://jsfiddle.net/rqmhvtdr/
[05:42:11] <Horacsio> Kruptein http://jsfiddle.net/rqmhvtdr/1/ this helps?
[05:42:50] <Kruptein> Horacsio, not on my end, the problem seems to be that the mouseleave not always triggers or that the mouseenter triggers twice
[05:43:20] <Kruptein> if you move your mouse from a text to an icon and back it often stays with the replaced text instead of returning to the original
[05:44:03] <Horacsio> oh ok
[05:44:26] <Horacsio> I would use hide and show divs...
[05:44:35] <Kruptein> k ill try that
[05:44:48] <Horacsio> or css the temporarytest
[05:45:32] <Horacsio> let me know if I helped :)
[05:45:40] <Horacsio> its important since I'm a rookie :D
[05:45:47] <Kruptein> :D haha ok will do
[05:51:46] <Kruptein> Horacsio, hey I fixed it weew, two divs with show/hide did the trick :)
[05:51:47] <Kruptein> http://jsfiddle.net/rqmhvtdr/2/
[06:02:38] <xxx1337> how do i change the placeholder text color to a different color? http://jsfiddle.net/6HQWv/130/
[06:02:48] <xxx1337> using js
[06:04:43] <slax0r> xxx1337: http://stackoverflow.com/a/14967312/2867002
[06:11:19] <xxx1337> Is there something wrong with this syntax? for some reason it's crashing my form document.forms["form_877936"]["element_1"].addClass('placeholdertext');
[06:14:20] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: You're trying to use vanilla js with jquery methods.
[06:16:22] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: Do you want to do this with jQuery or vanilla js?
[06:17:42] <BillCriswell> Instead of addClass('placeholdertext') you can do .classList.add('placeholdertext'), but it's way more backwards compatible with jQuery.
[06:38:47] <hlfw0rd> I have an on click event for a series of li elements. The onclick makes an ajax request and regenerates a highchart for the new market segment. However, if someone clicks another li while the first is still loading, it can closs plotting issues on the graph. How can I disable click events until the first one is finished?
[06:38:57] <hlfw0rd> Here is a screenshot http://www.anony.ws/image/DoIx
[06:39:30] <hlfw0rd> I tried storing a loading variable as true or false, but all it does is wait until the first is nearly finished and then still executes second click
[06:41:27] <BillCriswell> hlfw0rd: You can set a boolean and check that when the click happens.
[06:41:51] <hlfw0rd> I tried that BillCriswell , wrapping around the on click event and the contents of the on click event :(
[06:42:08] <BillCriswell> hlfw0rd: Do it in the callback of the click.
[06:42:19] <hlfw0rd> Ah, good idea
[06:42:55] <BillCriswell> var loading = false; $('li').on('click', function () { if (!loading) { loading = true; $.ajax().done(function() { loading = false }); } });
[06:43:43] <Ansikt> hlfw0rd: Alternatively, you can provide a wrapper around your ajax requests, and have them execute in a queue
[06:44:04] <Ansikt> then the second clicks won't be igonored - they'll just be executed once the environment is safe
[06:44:54] <stoned> :)
[06:45:30] <Ansikt> something like var callService = (function(){})();
[06:45:38] <Ansikt> woops, ignore that
[06:46:22] <BillCriswell> Yeah. That approach would probably be better. If they click two quickly I imagine more than likely the first click was a mistake.
[06:48:16] <Ansikt> Yeah, and as BillCrisswell says, you would probably want to also debounce the function.
[06:48:34] <hlfw0rd> Alright, you are probably right
[06:48:38] <hlfw0rd> thanks for the suggestions!
[06:51:50] <edrahn> I'm using the datepicker in my page: http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[06:52:12] <edrahn> How come my app shows it bigger than the datepicker web page?
[07:10:21] <BillCriswell> edrahn: How can we know why without any code?
[07:14:11] <xxx1337> thank btw BillCriswell or BillNiTheScienceGuy
[07:14:40] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: No problem.
[07:14:53] <BillCriswell> I wish I was as cool as Bill Nye.
[07:15:01] <matthias___> hi i have the following problem: multiple checkboxes are toggeling the visibility of some divs. making it hidden and non-hidden works fine. but now i want to store the values of the checkboxes in cookies so that their state stays the same if the page reloads
[07:15:07] <BillCriswell> I was the president of his fan club in elementary school.
[07:15:43] <BillCriswell> matthias___: I think you'd be safer using localStorage and .serializeArray() to do that.
[07:16:03] <matthias___> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=Ci9BvamVKj if the first box is checked 2 buttons should appear. but if the site is reloaded the box stays checked but the buttons flash for a short time and are hidden again
[07:27:36] <wdkevin> Is it better to use function(e) and this e.target or to just use this?
[07:32:51] <BillCriswell> wdkevin: Depends what you want.
[07:33:18] <BillCriswell> this isn't always e.target.
[07:33:24] <wdkevin> BillCriswell, well they both give me the same value, im asking from a purely performance level, if there is even a micro difference
[07:33:26] <wdkevin> fair enough
[07:33:42] <BillCriswell> wdkevin: Nothing you should ever have to worry about.
[07:33:45] <BillCriswell> wdkevin: http://jsbin.com/bahefusitone/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:34:19] <wdkevin> i was just cleaning up good and i saw a mix of e.target and this throughout several functions where, in my case, they are the same value
[07:34:33] <wdkevin> so i wanted to clean it up and make a variable, and got to thinking about which one is better to use for targetting
[07:35:06] <wdkevin> BillCriswell, great example btw. thank you for that
[07:35:56] <BillCriswell> wdkevin: No problem at all.
[07:36:50] <wdkevin> are the Bill Criswell in Philly?
[07:37:06] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:37:19] <wdkevin> Very cool. Harrisburg here. Small world.
[07:37:43] <matthias___> BillCriswell: http://bpaste.net/show/mc129hD8YBMzfgHl9gVn/ stil flashing and then going away when the checkbox was checked and the page reloaded
[07:37:43] <BillCriswell> Yeah it is and it's awesome.

[08:57:34] <TheEternalAbyss> hi there, quick question.. I'm trying to cause my page to reload when jquery detects a change in resolution. Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/Cnu3bEYE it seems like it detects the change with the .resize(), but no refresh is happening. What am i missing here?
[08:57:54] <TheEternalAbyss> line 7 specifically
[08:59:45] <dllama> ok its actually less of a brian fart than i thought, but can use some guidance on a better approach,
[08:59:46] <dllama> http://jsfiddle.net/zt815d1r/
[08:59:50] <TheEternalAbyss> funny thing is if i just put in my console location.reload(); it works just spiffy
[09:00:01] <dllama> you guys think i should do it as a hidden element or just write it as a var?
[09:01:59] <dllama> straight to a variable right? since essentially i'd be converting it to a var in calendar js anyway
[09:07:01] <dllama> well that didn't work
[09:07:41] <dllama> but this is due to ruby/haml and using a javascript tag
[09:15:49] <Horacsio> How do I reset both functions with one button click?
[09:15:56] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/L7w49k0t/3/ somehow the plugins arent working but the ideia is to reset both functions when pressed "cancelar" light gray button.
[09:16:04] <Horacsio> I have the plugins working here: http://bias.baannng.com/#biascontact
[09:17:34] <Horacsio> someone to help here please?
[09:18:34] <anonymous> i want tutorials for jquery :D
[09:19:25] <dmsuperman> Horacsio: "reset both functions"?
[09:20:21] <Horacsio> yes.  I want to reset all the form to its start position
[09:21:18] <Horacsio> when I click "cancelar" and when the forms is sent.
[09:21:43] <Horacsio> but for now when I click the "cancelar" button which is a reset input
[09:23:01] <Horacsio> dmsuperman: did you get the idea?
[09:30:50] <stan_man_can> I‚Äôm loading some data into a page via ajax and need to count the elements after, but $(‚Äú#element‚Äù) won‚Äôt select it, I know I‚Äùm supposed to us ‚Äòon‚Äô but how do I trigger it without any user interation?
[09:31:05] <Horacsio> any help would be appreciated thanks :)
[09:31:11] <stan_man_can> I‚Äôm loading data into a table so essentially once it‚Äôs loaded I want to count now many rows were added and update a box saying ‚ÄúX rows added‚Äù
[09:31:45] <decx> why count an id?
[09:31:52] <decx> it's either going to be 0 or 1
[09:32:08] <stan_man_can> decx: sorry it‚Äôs not an id
[09:32:22] <stan_man_can> $(‚Äútable tbody tr‚Äù).length is what i need to get
[09:32:38] <decx> in your .done you can find/filter inside the returned data from the ajax
[09:32:43] <stan_man_can> the row‚Äôs are all returned via an ajax call and I load them into a table with $(‚Äútable tbody‚Äù).html(data)
[09:32:59] <hooligan321> hm any one know why jsfiddle is not loading in internet exploror?
[09:33:16] <decx> ie8?
[09:33:23] <hooligan321> it bombs on loading the awesome
[09:33:35] <hooligan321> well not properly crash just the content/layout does
[09:34:22] <hooligan321> ah nm compatibile view
[09:34:27] <hooligan321> stupid thing ;)
[09:34:39] <stan_man_can> decx: Right now i have $.post(‚Äòajax.php‚Äô, {vars}, function(data) { do stuff with data; })
[09:34:42] <stan_man_can> do I just chain .done at the end?
[09:34:43] <decx> stan_man_can you should be able to get the length or your new trs after you appended it
[09:34:57] <decx> done is the new way to do these success functions
[09:35:17] <decx> $.post(url).done(function(){ })
[09:48:07] <decx> what's a good logic to make sure it uses rotateX or rotateZ to always go upwards with w or the arrowup key? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/n6aasz89/
[09:52:24] <Horacsio> please help
[09:52:37] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/L7w49k0t/3/ somehow the plugins arent working but the ideia is to reset both functions when pressed "cancelar" light gray button.

[09:54:39] <decx> why yes that's you ^^

[10:07:22] <b100110101> Hello, you know where i can find a sample about accordion: i would like an accordion in 100% of height of page
[10:07:32] <b100110101> i try fill, content, auto
[10:08:26] <decx> you count how many accordion segments there are, sum up their height and substract that from the viewport height
[10:08:34] <decx> it's not rocketscience
[10:09:26] <b100110101> xD
[10:09:36] <b100110101> thank's i will do that =)
[10:11:22] <decx> b100110101 heightStyle: 'fill' does just that though
[10:12:20] <b100110101> with heightStyle: 'fill', my height div are 0px
[10:12:35] <decx> it's based on the accordions parent
[10:13:16] <b100110101> it's height: 100%; and body are height: 100%;
[10:13:19] <Horacsio> decx: could you please give some orientation? please?
[10:13:31] <b100110101> i continue to search, thx

[10:36:33] <dllama> ughhhh, this calendar thing is seriously kicking my ass

[10:38:11] <aZtec_> https://gist.github.com/alexJunger/971044900f0273902ce9
[10:39:08] <aZtec_> I'm assuming this has something to do with the point at which I call the constructor, in relation to the state of the DOM
[10:39:28] <aZtec_> But I was under the assumption that $(window).load would only fire when all images are done loading
[10:42:09] <EminenceHC> I have: if ($(this).val() === '17')  and I am trying to chain if it equals three numbers instead of one. Can I do: if ($(this).val() === ['17', '18', '19']) ?
[10:42:40] <decx> no
[10:42:48] <dllama> EminenceHC: think you should be able to do if in array
[10:45:12] <Horacsio> hey decx I found how to reset the validator :P
[10:47:16] <Horacsio> now I need to reset the slidding labels :D

[11:18:42] <dllama> anyone here experienced with fullcalendar.js?
[11:18:47] <dllama> this thing has been kicking my ass for like 3hrs now
[11:18:55] <dllama> can really use some help please
[11:21:02] <b100110101> no but u can try it with you
[11:21:22] <b100110101> (i'm beginner in css)
[11:22:03] <dllama> b100110101: css works fine, i can't get it to populate with my data
[11:22:13] <b100110101> in js
[11:22:16] <b100110101> with json ?
[11:22:46] <dllama> yea,
[11:22:54] <dllama> i'll gist it in a minute, trying a few different things here
[11:23:12] <dllama> i feel like i'm getting closer‚Ä¶ it just doesn't populate info where i need  :/
[11:23:21] <b100110101> i show the source code of : http://arshaw.com/js/fullcalendar-2.0.2/demos/theme.html
[11:23:48] <b100110101> there are an events array : events[]
[11:24:13] <b100110101> inside you put your event same like : { 					title: 'Long Event', 					start: '2014-06-07', 					end: '2014-06-10' 				}, ....
[11:24:18] <docmur> I'm trying to do something like: http://jsfiddle.net/rL1qpv4b/1/,  What is the right way to do this?  In my real code I generate the Div's in PHP
[11:25:30] <dllama> b100110101: i'm somewhere there, thank you you actually pointed me closer to where i need to be
[11:25:44] <dllama> i have a function that returns "calendar" and later i'm doing events: calendar
[11:25:51] <b100110101> docmur: you can (it's one way, maybe not the better way) write code inside "onclick" event with php ?
[11:25:57] <dllama> well that worked lol
[11:25:59] <dllama> sort of :D
[11:26:34] <b100110101> echo " <input type='button' onclick=' jsfunction(this);' value'myButton' >"
[11:26:47] <b100110101> nice =)
[11:27:39] <dllama> i'm such an asshole
[11:27:49] <dllama> i re-declared var midway through the function
[11:28:00] <dllama> so it wasn't being passed back via scope
[11:28:20] <docmur> perfect!
[11:28:24] <dllama> https://www.evernote.com/shard/s197/sh/bc152a43-0be0-462d-a33f-b97a5ceaa728/15e44f656380eb818b57386c07beb083
[11:28:26] <dllama> yeaaaa buddy :D
[11:28:26] <docmur> that is exactly what I want to do
[11:29:12] <dllama> 3hrs later i got that btch to work‚Ä¶. feeling somewhat accomplished and yet beat to hell lol
[11:29:27] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/dt0xddsL/3/ Could someone help me figure out why I can't get the value of qstring outside of the on change function? I am trying to get whatever the value is of the select field.
[11:32:24] <b100110101> maybe it's a scope problem ?
[11:32:35] <phelix> I am not sure if I need to be using var qstring = or qstring =
[11:32:52] <phelix> if i put a console.log inside the function I can get the value of qstring but not outside.
[11:33:07] <b100110101> oO
[11:33:15] <b100110101> why you use the variable ?
[11:33:20] <b100110101> how
[11:33:22] <b100110101> not why
[11:33:29] <b100110101> how/where you use it
[11:33:45] <phelix> if you click the radio button you will see the select field appera
[11:34:31] <b100110101> yes, the value change,
[11:34:45] <b100110101> and after, where you use this value ?
[11:35:39] <phelix> the console.log(qstring) at the bottom
[11:35:47] <phelix> it doesn't seem to display
[11:36:14] <b100110101> okay, but the console.log is call when the page are load
[11:37:11] <phelix> ops i missed where it will be applied.
[11:37:11] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/dt0xddsL/6/
[11:37:26] <phelix> it needs to be applied to the function inside line 41
[11:38:43] <phelix> same way thestring variable is working. Trying to update it also
[11:38:58] <phelix> as its value needs to update the link href field
[11:40:28] <b100110101> sorry, i'm not enough brain, but you can show the value with         console.log(qstring); inside each function
[11:41:26] <phelix> yeha, I need to get that value inside the function inside line 41
[11:41:31] <b100110101> if you write "variableName" without var , the variable should be "global" else if you write "var" befor the scope change
[11:42:03] <b100110101> the scope is between { and } where you are write "var variableName"
[11:42:09] <phelix> i tried it both ways and wasn't getting it to show outside the function
[11:42:36] <thang> scope is function based not block based
[11:42:37] <robertbusy> don't use global vars btw
[11:42:42] <robertbusy> scope the var to a parent function.
[11:43:41] <b100110101> Yes, it's the best practice, i put alert(qstring); in line 42, and it's works
[11:44:34] <robertbusy> try to use console logs btw.  alert stops script execution and may not actually be indicative of how the script actually runs :)
[11:45:34] <b100110101> wo√©.. but i don't show the console in jsfiddle
[11:45:44] <robertbusy> you use your browser's console.
[11:45:45] <robertbusy> :)
[11:46:11] <b100110101> xD
[11:47:13] <b100110101> same player play : i try with console.log(qstring); at line 42; and it's work
[11:48:08] <phelix> really? can you poaste me the url for it?
[11:48:36] <b100110101> no, i don't use jsfiddle
[11:48:46] <b100110101> wirte console.log(qstring); at line 42
[11:49:00] <b100110101> when you click on your button, you will show the value of qstring
[11:50:46] <phelix> hmm not for me.. weird
[11:50:54] <b100110101> arf
[11:51:22] <b100110101> http://jsfiddle.net/dt0xddsL/8/
[11:51:34] <b100110101> i anderstand the tool
[11:52:26] <b100110101> 1. Click on radio 2.Change the value 3. Click "add to cart"
[11:52:34] <b100110101> => show the console log
[11:52:43] <phelix> ahh i wasn't clicking add to cart.. ok there it goes
[11:52:44] <phelix> nice
[11:54:57] <xxx1337> anyone know of an elegant way to have these come in at different times intead of all at once? http://jsfiddle.net/1kyvjb4y/
[11:56:28] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: You mean random different times or one after another?
[11:56:47] <xxx1337> random would be nice
[11:57:02] <xxx1337> something like this is what im thinking: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1911855/adding-randomly-chosen-class-to-html-tag-using-jquery
[11:58:56] <BillCriswell> This is adding random classes, not delaying them randomly.
[11:59:04] <xxx1337> yea
[11:59:17] <xxx1337> i want to delay them randomly
[11:59:23] <xxx1337> having a hard time thinking about how to do so though
[11:59:47] <BillCriswell> You're adding a class called "hidden" then showing them, pretty confusing.
[12:00:03] <xxx1337> sorry you'
[12:00:06] <xxx1337> re correct
[12:00:09] <xxx1337> should rename that class
[12:00:36] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: There's a transition-delay property in CSS if you want to go that route.
[12:02:51] <xxx1337> how would i do that randomly to each of them though
[12:02:59] <xxx1337> without making a class for each li element
[12:08:31] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: You can look through each element and use .css().
[12:08:35] <BillCriswell> loop*
[12:10:49] <BillCriswell> or use .css() with a function.
[12:12:25] <BillCriswell> xxx1337: http://jsfiddle.net/1kyvjb4y/2/ something like this.
[12:15:09] <xxx1337> that's nice thanks

[14:52:33] <C0d3S> http://jsfiddle.net/wbvva51z/
[14:53:00] <C0d3S> now
[14:53:03] <C0d3S> after submitting the form
[14:53:18] <C0d3S> all $_POST results are emailed to me
[14:53:26] <C0d3S> which also works
[14:53:28] <C0d3S> however
[14:54:03] <C0d3S> right now its sending KEY -> VALUE  ($_POST is form_name and form_value)
[14:54:28] <C0d3S> form name, however, is not meant for reading.
[14:55:01] <C0d3S> how do i use jquery (for example, to getelementbyid for label or something) to add
[14:55:04] <C0d3S> er, better yet
[14:55:44] <C0d3S> how would i go about changing the form name to being something more readable
[14:56:11] <C0d3S> <input name="Dess1"> is the key which is sent in $_POST
[14:56:14] <C0d3S> is there a way to change that

[15:13:37] <opie-x> after the page navigates away?
[15:14:10] <cirenyc> The click currently adds additional field sets.  I want that to happen, then to trigger additional behavior.
[15:14:23] <cirenyc> There is no navigating away in this case.
[15:14:44] <opie-x> who's binding the "adds additional field sets" handler?
[15:15:06] <cirenyc> 3rd party code
[15:15:34] <cirenyc> I could go in a modify that, but would prefer not to if possible.
[15:16:03] <opie-x> depends how 3rd party does the binding and when they do the binding
[15:16:17] <opie-x> if you can listen to an event from the 3rd party, you could handle that instead of click
[15:16:31] <opie-x> it's going to be tricky to ensure the click event handler ordering, at least from my experience
[15:28:29] <cirenyc> opie-x Thanks!  I think I might be able to do that.
[15:34:19] <opie-x> yeah, sure thing
[15:35:15] <opie-x> had to use slash to escape the []'s if anyone was interested.  http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboudreau/qq03h89z/11/
[15:51:02] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, so add doesn't mutate the list you give it?
[15:51:10] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:51:13] <Scriptonaut> I'm inside .each, and I want to build several jQuery lists
[15:51:31] <Scriptonaut> $('blah').each(function(i) { x.add($(this)) })
[15:51:41] <Scriptonaut> I tried x = x.add($(this))
[15:51:42] <Scriptonaut> doesn't work
[15:52:06] <Scriptonaut> push
[15:52:13] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/
[15:52:39] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, reconsider what you're doing.
[15:53:34] <Scriptonaut> I have a list of inputs. if their index in the list is divisible by 3, I want to put them in a list
[15:53:37] <Scriptonaut> how do I do that?
[15:53:48] <Scriptonaut> extend doesn't seem to be what I want, I have a jQuery list, not an object
[15:54:28] <Scriptonaut> basically I need a push
[15:55:23] <robertmaxrees> the jquery list *is* and object.
[15:57:38] <frank_o> Hi! Which slider is better? https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/ or https://github.com/OwlFonk/OwlCarousel?
[15:58:53] <frank_o> slick has close to 7000 stars but owl doesnt look half bad either. both support mobile.
[15:59:27] <robertmaxrees> probably "slick",  but http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/ :)
[16:03:32] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: hehe im having doubts now :)
[16:04:19] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: its for displaying fashion items in mobile browsers. should i just lay them out vertically so the user can scroll down/up instead?
[16:04:23] <Jattenalle> carousels that only move based on user input are fine though
[16:04:34] <Jattenalle> but auto carousels are the devil and needs to go away
[16:04:46] <frank_o> cool
[16:10:22] <frank_o> Say I got this -- var globalVar = { a: 'Lorem', b: 'Ipsum', c: 'Dolor' }; globalVar.d = 'Sit'; globalVar.e = 'Amet';
[16:10:25] <frank_o> Is there a way to DRY up that last part so I don't have to repeat `globalVar.X`? I.e.: var globalVar =+ { d: 'Sit', e: 'Amet' } -- http://jsfiddle.net/TuL3X/
[16:11:44] <shoky> frank_o: you can use something like $.extend e.g.  $.extend(globalVar, {...})
[16:12:33] <frank_o> shoky: oooh thats nice
[16:15:46] <ReBoRN`> I cant see this web -> http://jsfiddle.net/TuL3X/
[16:17:37] <shoky> wat
[16:21:20] <arkadio> >> globalVar = { a: 'Lorem', b: 'Ipsum', c: 'Dolor' }; globalVar.d = 'Sit'; globalVar.e = 'Amet';
[16:23:12] <Horacsio> I'm using Sliding Labels Plugin that attaches an event to form labels: https://github.com/timwright12/Sliding-Labels I would need some help on reset the effect in case input type: reset pressed.
[16:31:28] <Horacsio> please I need some orientation here: http://jsfiddle.net/g1gq5nmn/ this is the script
[16:33:08] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio what's your specific question?
[16:52:04] <rainabba> parent() and parents() appear to behave similarly. I need to query either app ancestors (including parent) and get only the first match from a set (xPath equivallent uses || if you know how that works) or I need to query ONLY THE parent for a set and get JUST that parent. Right now both $myTd.parent('tr, tbody, table') and $myTd.parents('tr, tbody, table') return ALL the ancestors and I thought
[16:52:04] <rainabba> parent() would only return the tr in this case. Suggestions?
[16:52:17] <rainabba> s/app/all
[16:53:18] <rainabba> "The .parents() and .parent() methods are similar, except that the latter only travels a single level up the DOM tree. " from http://api.jquery.com/parent/  but that's not what I see happening :(
[16:53:56] <rainabba> nm. Just realized my initial object had more than one jquery object in it :)
[16:55:42] <rainabba> Turns out that parent() will return matching parents for each object in the calling object so if $myTd contains an array of td, tr, tbody, table, $myTd.parent('tr, tbody, table') will return them all.  That could be useful.
[17:18:43] <sflw> Hi everyone, I'm getting an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL when I run these functions on document ready (it's an API call to Instagram in case that's not obvious): http://bpaste.net/show/Nbi2Em2wY6ij4oP10emW/ I've tried Googling the error and fussing with my AJAX but haven't been able to figure it out. What's going on here?
[17:19:56] <systemfault> sflw: It's difficult to help you... but dataType is probably 'jsonp', not 'json'
[17:20:35] <sflw> systemfault: Thanks, I'll try that. And why is it difficult to help? Was my question poorly worded or is it just a difficult error to work out?
[17:21:40] <systemfault> sflw: Because we're not living browsers... if we don't have a live pastebin where we can actually take a look at the errors, add console.log, etc... it's more difficult to help except for the obvious cases.
[17:22:23] <sflw> systemfault: Gotcha. So would something like a JSFiddle be more appropriate when asking for help?
[17:22:31] <shoky> sflw: you have a syntax error in line 34
[17:22:36] <systemfault> sflw: Start by trying to use jsonp
[17:22:56] <shoky> you have a newline in the middle of a string
[17:23:03] <systemfault> Could be that too :D
[17:23:32] <sflw> That could be a problem. ;)
[17:23:44] <sflw> I'll look at both issues, thanks guys.
[17:28:37] <sflw> I erased the newline (not sure how that got in there in the first place) and changed it to JSONP and now we're good to g. Thanks systemfault and shoky.
[17:37:58] <Horacsio> robertmaxrees: still there?
[17:39:19] <Horacsio> robertmaxrees: How do I reset the sliding labels to its original positions? http://bias.baannng.com/#biascontact
[17:42:05] <robertmaxrees> i dunno?
[17:42:12] <robertmaxrees> you using a plugin or something?
[17:43:53] <Horacsio> I am
[17:44:20] <Horacsio> Im using: https://github.com/timwright12/Sliding-Labels and http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[17:44:43] <Horacsio> I could reset validation, but dont know how to do it in sliding labels
[17:46:15] <Horacsio> Im trying this way, but the labels still dont get its original positions robertmaxrees
[17:46:51] <Horacsio> at least I need a click to make 2 actions/functions wherever its called
[17:47:23] <robertmaxrees> you can run two functions in a click event...
[17:49:12] <sammych> what's a better editor than jsfiddle and has framework selection?
[17:49:21] <sammych> jsfiddle is giving me the....poops
[17:49:26] <Horacsio> robertmaxrees: how I could do that?
[17:49:26] <robertmaxrees> some poeple like jsbin
[17:49:51] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio .on(click, function(){ funcOne(); funcTwo(); });
[17:49:53] <Horacsio> I can do the validator reset and then tell the labels to animate right!
[17:50:12] <sammych> ooh, I don't mind it
[17:50:33] <sammych> it has a console
[17:51:03] <robertmaxrees> codepen.io is another choice.
[17:51:18] <sammych> does it have framework add?
[17:51:33] <robertmaxrees> you could just use cdn.js and get the script tags yourself.
[17:51:39] <robertmaxrees> or the google developer site.
[17:51:58] <Horacsio> robertmaxrees: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/g1gq5nmn/ ?
[17:52:41] <Horacsio> robertmaxrees:is that sintaxe correct?
[17:52:47] <sammych> syntax*
[17:53:05] <robertmaxrees> it's formatted funky, but sure.
[17:53:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/g1gq5nmn/1/ is better.
[17:54:00] <sammych> oooh, I like jsbin already.
[17:54:38] <sammych> I like how the 'upgrade to pro' page is dead. Unless it's a joke
[18:03:17] <sammych> if an element is removed from the DOM via any means, do jQuery events get garbaged? Or do I have to call off() on them?
[18:04:30] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to worry about it :)
[18:05:15] <robertmaxrees> (jquery automatically handles that stuff for you)
[19:20:06] <zogdog> I'm having a problems with asynchronous I believe, was hoping someone could look over my code and see where I may be having the problem?
[19:21:16] <zogdog> Each of the fields in the form appear, since I'm pulling it in from a partial, but as soon as I start trying to populate it, the fields contain the words for a second, then disappear
[19:24:44] <zogdog> I have a jsfiddle link if you have time to look at it
[19:29:54] <ZogDog> http://jsfiddle.net/njyo3rgz/
[19:32:53] <raisdead> I am running IE9-11. http://jsfiddle.net/zavsdxzz/5/ The after selecting a date on the second input, the input is refocused and the datepicker reopens. Can anyone tell me why?
[19:33:55] <taklong> is it not allowed to clear a filefield using jquery?
[19:37:26] <ZogDog> After clicking on one of the <a> elements, it should populate the form fields with the data from the document.  It's not and I'm wondering if it's an asynchronous issue. http://jsfiddle.net/njyo3rgz/  Thank you!
[19:41:00] <raisdead> taklong: I don't know if your comment was directed at me, if it was I dont understand.
[19:41:39] <ZogDog> taklong: was that directed at me?  If so, I also don't know how to answer :)
[19:48:21] <donni> hi, how to load a function after other function is triggered?
[19:49:04] <taklong> its a quest actually. im trying to empty a filefield
[19:49:08] <taklong> *question
[20:12:29] <floatmastaflex> yo, element.collection.find('.somematchedelements); should match multiple elements if they exist, right?
[20:20:01] <_maz> ok this is driving me crazy. I have a font-awesome icon (spinning arrows) that I need to be hidden at first, then when a button is clicked, show spinner, on success/fail, hide again
[20:20:23] <_maz> toggle() works, but the spinner is showing when the page is loaded
[20:20:31] <_maz> so toggle() does the inverse of what I want
[20:20:49] <_maz> how do I have the icon appear hidden at first?
[20:22:07] <floatmastaflex> yo, someelementcollection.find('.somematchedelements); should match multiple elements if they exist, right?
[22:00:30] <frank_o> If I have `<img src="http://lorempixel.com/100/100">` and clone that with jQuery, will the browser make two requests to lorempixel.com or will it copy the image fetched on the first request?
[22:01:39] <Uhkis> firebugs net log helps
[22:01:50] <frank_o> Uhkis: thanks
[22:03:06] <frank_o> Seems like it's only one request - http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qzg85j9h/
[22:23:06] <frank_o> COol its not just clone. If I put the same image URL twice the browser will only fetch the image once.
[23:53:45] <jquery839> Hey guys
[23:53:58] <jquery839> How can I access my object literal like this?
[23:54:08] <jquery839> return this.days.{input};
[23:54:29] <jquery839> If input is Friday, I want to access this.days.friday
[23:54:41] <jquery839> Input is the param to my function
[23:58:49] <Cork> jquery839: no
[23:59:00] <Cork> this.days[input] will work though
