[00:09:05] <zylophone> how can i concatanate a list of ids together from a selector? e.g. var ids = $('.foo').attr('id') seems to only give one id
[00:15:01] <Cork> zylophone: $.map($('.foo'), function(elm) { $(elm).attr('id'); })
[00:15:38] <Cork> if you really want to concat them
[00:15:42] <Cork> zylophone: $.map($('.foo'), function(elm) { $(elm).attr('id'); }).join('')
[00:20:46] <zylophone> Cork: thanks, that's neater than a .each
[00:21:21] <Cork> zylophone: opps just noticed i missed the return statement
[00:21:25] <Cork> zylophone: $.map($('.foo'), function(elm) { return $(elm).attr('id'); })
[00:23:18] <xec> you could just return elm.id; too
[00:27:53] <zylophone> el.id returns "" when no id is specified, but doing .attr('id') doesn't
[00:27:59] <zylophone> interesting
[00:28:20] <Cork> uh what does attr('id') return then?
[00:29:14] <zylophone> well [] vs ["","",""] (.attr being the first array given)
[00:30:06] <zylophone> http://jsfiddle.net/8fnYw/
[00:30:27] <Cork> ya, ya
[00:30:37] <Cork> elm.id returns the property
[00:30:46] <Cork> and it normalizes the id to a string
[00:30:53] <Cork> attr returns getAttribute('id')
[00:31:05] <Cork> and if the attribute doesn't exist it returns undefined
[00:31:23] <Cork> $.map($('.foo'), function(elm) { return elm.getAttribute('id'); }) should give the same output though
[00:31:39] <Cork> ya, ya == ah, ya
[00:31:43] <xec> ya ya ya
[00:31:45] <xec> ;D
[00:31:48] <Cork> ^^'
[00:31:59] <Cork> i hate when i do that type of typos
[00:33:26] <anli_> How can I find which references I need to add for a certain class? I want to use the class ScriptEngine
[00:33:29] <zylophone> is there a jquery function for comparing flat arrays together, or should i just cycle through them and compare manually?
[00:34:09] <Cork> zylophone: you can use inArray, but ya it only works with a value
[00:34:25] <Cork> zylophone: so ya two for loops is prob the simplest option
[00:34:37] <zylophone> yeah, for the sake of two lines, i'm not gonna complain!
[00:34:47] <zylophone> it's a flat array, so only one for loop ;)
[00:35:23] <Cork> zylophone: if you want to check all values in one array is inside another
[00:35:26] <Cork> you need two loops
[00:35:40] <Cork> if you just want to look for one value you have $.inArray
[00:35:56] <Cork> ?jQuery.inArray
[00:35:56] <anli_> Oh, ScriptEngine is a class not written by ms it seems
[00:36:00] <zylophone> ah, i just want to checkt that an array of strings,is the same as another array of strings
[00:36:13] <Cork> zylophone: that needs two loops
[00:36:28] <zylophone> well the order is important too
[00:36:34] <Cork> zylophone: one loop around the first array, and inside it a loop of the second array to see if it exist in there
[00:36:39] <Cork> ah
[00:36:46] <zylophone> yeah ;)
[01:14:19] <larsemil> what am i doing wrong. why is data attribute not removed? http://jsfiddle.net/6eRm6/
[01:19:44] <anli_> Is var foo = function() {} the same as var foo = function() {}; ?
[01:19:55] <anli_> Maybe that is a #javascript question
[01:22:38] <Villor> I am trying to catch an event where a select is changed, but I need it to include the last selected option as well(which .change does not), how can this be done? I tried doing $('select option').click but that did not seem to work...
[01:23:06] <BinaryKitten> anli_ always terminate your JS with ;
[01:23:17] <anli_> That is actually what I do
[01:23:22] <BinaryKitten> if you did function foo() { }   you don't need it
[01:23:34] <BinaryKitten> but if you're using function in an assignment capacity, you do
[01:23:49] <anli_> I am into writing tests that my js is well formatted
[01:24:10] <anli_> Using the ScriptEngine class on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4744105/parse-and-execute-js-by-c-sharp
[01:24:21] <anli_> Seems like I cannot check for semi colons however
[01:24:40] <anli_> Would be nice with a strict script engine
[01:32:20] <xec> larsemil: .removeData() removes values set with .data() (not attributes)
[01:32:22] <xec> larsemil: http://jsfiddle.net/6eRm6/1/
[01:33:56] <Cork> anli_: yes and no
[01:34:12] <anli_> At least for testing
[01:34:15] <Cork> anli_: javascript adds ; at the end of a line if there isn't one
[01:34:39] <anli_> Lets assume I want them in the code as well
[01:34:45] <Cork> anli_: so var a = 1 and var a = 1; is the same as long as nothing else is coming after it on the same line
[01:34:51] <anli_> ok
[01:35:01] <anli_> Hm
[01:35:18] <Cork> though if you ever want to minimize the code you should be very careful about skipping ;
[01:35:30] <anli_> Too bad a line ending after the return keyword breaks the returning of a value
[01:35:41] <anli_> Ah, ok
[01:35:53] <Cork> anli_: uh your talking about some preprocessor now
[01:35:59] <Cork> that isn't standard js
[01:35:59] <anli_> I let some minifier do that then
[01:36:05] <anli_> ok
[01:36:18] <anli_> Never knew there are a preprocessor in js
[01:36:29] <Cork> javascript pre harmony doens't have implicit return in any form
[01:38:33] <Cork> anli_: things like coffiescript is preprocessors
[01:38:35] <xec> Cork: no but if you have a line break after the return keyword, it will insert a semicolon there
[01:38:42] <anli_> ok
[01:38:45] <xec> Cork: i think that's what anli_ is talking about
[01:38:52] <anli_> yeah
[01:39:05] <Cork> xec: semicolon on an empty line doesn't change anything
[01:39:10] <xec> its not empty
[01:39:18] <xec> it has the return keyword
[01:39:28] <Cork> not sure what you mean then
[01:39:30] <xec> followed by what you want to return
[01:39:39] <Cork> you mean return \n value-to-return; ?
[01:39:46] <Cork> ah
[01:39:48] * Cork nods
[01:40:05] <Cork> could do return (\n value-to-return\n );

[02:38:00] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone can help me? I'm trying to do a infinite scroll but not works. I implemented this code: http://jsfiddle.net/gRzPF/268/ on a webpage http://pastebin.com/xSYR0LgS, but in the web not works
[02:38:06] <abailarri> Suggestions?
[02:38:08] <lenswipe> having an issue with a jquery selector
[02:38:16] <lenswipe> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #meny/#red
[02:38:30] <lenswipe> it's referencing: $('a[href*=#]:not([href=#])')

[02:39:12] <lenswipe> aha!
[02:39:37] <brunoais> lenswipe, use double quotes

[02:40:06] <brunoais> abailarri, nothing in the console?

[02:40:40] <abailarri> 	
[02:40:40] <abailarri> $(document).ready(function(){
[02:40:55] <brunoais> abailarri, problem solved
[02:41:02] <brunoais> the variable is not defined
[02:41:04] <Cork> abailarri: are you running from file://?
[02:41:11] <abailarri> Cork, yes
[02:41:25] <Cork> then file://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js will be a bit of a problem :)
[02:41:34] <Cork> abailarri: you have to save it locally
[02:42:36] <StephenS> Cork: why are you not xorg
[02:42:45] <Cork> huh?
[02:44:14] <abailarri> Cork, I tried with a local  js file and not works
[02:44:46] <Cork> abailarri: make sure your not referencing a file below your current html file location
[02:44:49] <Cork> meaning no ../
[02:45:09] <Cork> also when we're at it
[02:45:21] <Cork> you SHOULD set up a test server for your development
[02:45:24] <abailarri> Cork, works, now works, I need to change some values of the windows sezes
[02:45:34] <Cork> writing on file:// break on a lot of places where a real site won't
[02:48:19] <fn> is there a reason why step in animate not work, when animate is on each()?
[02:48:19] <fn> http://pastie.org/private/myyxicpzxghasjpjf3rzrq
[02:48:59] <Cork> fn: define your variables!
[02:49:44] <fn> var id,timemin,timesec,minutes,seconds,output,time,speed,rate,size,duration,width,parentwidth;
[02:49:50] <fn> it's only a part of the code...
[02:50:18] <Cork> well each isn't the cause of the problem
[02:50:32] <fn> what's the problem?
[02:50:33] <Cork> but can't tell what happens from just this
[02:50:42] <Cork> make a fiddle of the problem
[02:52:51] <fn> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/TDYW3/
[02:53:58] <fn> better view: http://git.marcwyss.me/internet/
[02:54:10] <Cork> fn: well step fires 52 times
[02:54:50] <Cork> but as your sharing the variables cross all the animations
[02:54:54] <Cork> you will only have one value
[02:55:02] <Cork> specifically parentwidth
[02:57:22] <fn> parenwidth is the div arround
[02:57:30] <fn> it has always the same width
[02:57:55] <Cork> no parentwidth is the width of the parent of the last element with the class .speed
[02:58:02] <Cork> all other elements is ignored
[02:58:16] <Cork> parentwidth = $(this).find('.speed').last().parent().width();
[02:59:34] <fn> parent of .speed has always the same width...
[02:59:37] <fn> that's not the problem
[02:59:52] <fn> the problem is, when i have step inside the animate(), all animates are the same
[03:05:31] <Cork> fn: well it is most likely cause all your variables is global
[03:05:35] <Cork> yes you define them
[03:05:39] <Cork> but you define them globally
[03:05:57] <Cork> the fiddle is broken so can't test what exactly is breaking
[03:06:41] <Cork> but what is breaking you is the asynchronous behavior of animations
[03:07:24] <Cork> can't say much more then that without rebuilding your site so i can test it
[03:16:35] <paulvd> hello, am trying to make all li's in a row equal height with this code, but the last one is being left out sigh http://jsfiddle.net/y84zZ/1/

[04:11:58] <Cork> sure
[04:12:06] <Cork> or did you mean pm?
[04:13:04] <abailarri> Hello. I have a question. How can I show the all divs except the first when I scroll the page? http://jsfiddle.net/K8BMm/5/
[04:13:32] <fn> Cork: http://git.marcwyss.me/internet/
[04:13:42] <fn> event triggered on selection at "Bitte wählen"
[04:15:02] <Cork> fn: your still using global variables
[04:15:47] <fn> Cork: srsly
[04:15:53] <fn> when i delete step
[04:15:56] <fn> it works perfectly
[04:16:03] <fn> why with step not?
[04:16:53] <Cork> abailarri: you mean something like $('div').slize(1).show() ?
[04:17:40] <abailarri> sorry Cork for my bad explanation. I want to show div 2, 3, 4 and 5 when I scroll to bottom
[04:17:52] <abailarri> onlye the div 1 is always visible
[04:18:04] <Cork> abailarri: you mean you want to show them as you scroll?
[04:18:07] <Cork> one by one?
[04:18:18] <abailarri> yes
[04:18:19] <Cork> btw *slice
[04:18:41] <Cork> abailarri: then you need to loop them as you scroll and check there position().top
[04:22:33] <fn> Cork: do you have any idea?
[04:23:01] <Cork> as it most likely is race related like i said i need to modify the code to check what is causing it
[04:24:00] <abailarri> Cork, something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/K8BMm/16/
[04:24:04] <abailarri> It not works
[04:30:38] <abailarri> Cork, now works, but how can I show one by one?
[04:32:15] <Cork> abailarri: $('.videonum').not(':visible').each(function() { if($(this).position().top < limit) { $(this).show(); } })
[04:32:18] <Cork> something like that
[04:36:17] <abailarri> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/K8BMm/26/
[04:40:33] <abailarri> Cork, I don't understand what do this: if($(this).position().top < limit) {
[04:40:40] <Cork> one min
[04:44:57] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/K8BMm/29/ fixed the missing }
[04:47:22] <Cork> abailarri: http://jsfiddle.net/K8BMm/30/
[04:47:50] <Cork> sidenote width; 200px; will be ignored
[04:48:01] <Cork> you prob meant width: 200px;

[05:28:54] <dsdsds> i am using a series of $(#selector).change(function(){}); in my code, so i want to reuse variables used in one function in another $(#selector).change(function(){}); , how can i do it? can annoymous functions have return values?how can i use variables calculated inside one function in another?
[05:30:56] <Cork> dsdsds: you can't
[05:31:07] <Cork> dsdsds: you need to share the variable to do it
[05:31:45] <dsdsds> hmm.... so how can i share them?actually it is calculation of a value, if i cant use , then i will have to calculate that value over and over again
[05:31:53] <Cork> (function() { var sharedVarialbe = true; $(#selector).change(function(){ sharedVariable }); $(#selector).change(function(){ sharedVariable }); })()
[05:32:56] <Cork> dsdsds: and if you don't need to hide the variable from the function you run your .change in
[05:32:59] <Cork> you can just define it there

[05:35:08] <ph88> can i append a div and set a click handler on the div i just appended on the same line? or do i have to find it again in the dom
[05:35:25] <MikeD_> Cork: why did that example have two instances of the .change() function applied ?
[05:36:07] <MikeD_> ph88: use .appendTo
[05:36:28] <ph88> MikeD_: does the element need to be in the DOM to be able to add an event handler to it?
[05:36:38] <MikeD_> ph88:  $('<div>...</div>').appendTo( target ).on( ... )
[05:37:05] <ph88> MikeD_: i think i can use the <div /> notation, is that right ?
[05:37:24] <MikeD_> also you can do:  var mydiv = $('<div />');  then mydiv.on()  (etc.)
[05:37:45] <MikeD_> yeah, if you're only adding a very basic div and not a whole glob of html :)

[05:49:39] <milligan> seutje, is "\." a sufficient escape ?
[05:49:49] <milligan> or does it require \\. ?
[05:50:02] <seutje> milligan: think so, but not entirely sure tbh
[05:50:07] <seutje> `tias
[05:50:07] <b-ot> seutje: Try It And See
[05:51:28] <MikeD_> that escaping is so ugly i'd just make a point of not putting 'dots' in the string at all
[05:51:58] <milligan> Changed my id to something more sane, and now it's working like a charm. escaping made no difference .. unless my code was messed up. Anyway, problem fixed. Thanks a bunch! :)
[05:53:15] <Cork> seutje, milligan you need \\.
[05:53:28] <Cork> one \\ for the string and \. for the selector
[05:53:47] <Cork> (or just fix the id to be valid)
[05:53:51] <seutje> oh, well there you go
[05:54:10] <Cork> if you type "\." the string will be "."
[05:54:22] <Cork> so there won't be anything for the selector to see :)
[05:55:24] <seutje> I have 2 rather large chunks of GeoJSON with a property referencing eachother... anyone know a tool that could help me merge them?
[05:55:32] <MikeD_> if your "id" has periods in it, how can you express a css selector like #foo.bar without it being a bar classname of the foo id ?

[05:56:40] <Cork> MikeD_: you can't

[06:00:12] <Cork> didn't even think of id's with > in them...
[06:00:17] <ph88> MikeD_: yes i have styling with width and heigh on 16px and a distinct background color
[06:00:21] <seutje> now programmers in non-latin character languages won't have a reason not to localize their code q.q
[06:00:48] <seutje> id="#.#.#" is one of my favorites
[06:01:27] <Cork> uhh...
[06:01:28] <MikeD_> just because you can, doesn't mean you should
[06:01:31] <Cork> uggg >_<
[06:01:34] <Cork> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/w3qRm/1/
[06:02:07] <Cork> #a\ b\ c\ \.d\ \>\ div { color: blue; }
[06:02:10] <seutje> :D
[06:02:14] <Cork> TT_TT
[06:02:22] <Cork> PLEASE DON'T EVER DO THAT!!!!!
[06:02:32] <seutje> shooting yourself in the foot for dummies :D
[06:02:41] <seutje> aka ASP.NET :P
[06:03:08] <MikeD_> there should be a disclaimer on that page: "If you use this, nobody will ever help you debug it."
[06:03:16] <Cork> lol
[06:03:17] <Cork> true
[06:04:09] <Cork> man... this talk is going to give me nightmares tonight...
[06:04:23] <Cork> i just visioned a page with css selectors as ids
[06:05:19] <MikeD_> yeah, and the only tag they used was <div>
[06:05:28] <Cork> #a\ b\ c\ \.d\ \>\ div > .v > div > #div\ \>\ \.h {}
[06:11:21] <Cork> perfect
[06:11:30] <Cork> seutje, MikeD_: http://jsfiddle.net/w3qRm/2/
[06:14:54] <MikeD_> you know, if you're going to spend any time making such absurd test cases you deserve those nightmares  :p
[06:14:58] <seutje> Cork: evil
[06:15:14] <seutje> should be helping me find a tool to combine geo json sets :P
[06:15:33] <Cork> seutje: just merge two objects?
[06:15:37] <Cork> or connect keys?
[06:15:43] <seutje> connect keys
[06:15:48] <Cork> eeh...
[06:15:48] <seutje> an inner join, if u will
[06:16:00] <MikeD_> seutje: you're probably going to have to walk one and do lookups in the other
[06:16:03] <seutje> but just opening the set in sublime crashes it
[06:16:05] <MikeD_> walk/map
[06:16:07] <Cork> that will need loops, and lots of them
[06:16:49] <seutje> was hoping for a CLI tool to map them to a database-like structure or something I could then query
[06:19:14] <MikeD_> seutje:  if the data came from a search, why not just requery that source for more manageable sets?
[06:19:17] <seutje> oh wait, http://stedolan.github.io/jq seems to support it
[06:19:33] <seutje> MikeD_: I just have 2 static .json files
[06:19:58] <seutje> http://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Invokingjq "If you run jq with --argfile foo bar, then $foo is available in the program and has the value resulting from parsing the content of the file named bar."
[06:20:02] <MikeD_> oh - that's kinda weird, but i guess you have to work with whatever you've got :)
[06:20:03] <seutje> seems like that could do the trick :D
[06:20:20] <seutje> it's  a governmental dataset, I'm just glad it's in a format I know :P
[06:21:16] <MikeD_> have you looked for that same stuff behind a google api?  a lot of government stuff has already been eaten by google.
[06:21:20] <MikeD_> (NSA included)
[06:21:41] <seutje> yeah, but can't find it in a single set
[06:22:37] <seutje> it's basically outlines for geographical regions of europe, regardless of country, but they have internal IDs and standardised IDs, naturally, the set with the geometry only has the internal ID, and the other file has the ID to ID mapping
[06:23:12] <murr4y> when creating a new element, is this correct? $($.parseHTML('<p>foo</p>'));
[06:24:50] <NoiseEee> murr4y: no, just:  var p = $('<p>') is fine
[06:26:04] <murr4y> aha, thanks - is there any semantic difference?
[06:28:37] <NoiseEee> using .parseHTML is just incorrect
[06:29:51] <NoiseEee> i mean its just unnecessary really when you're creating bare elements
[06:30:21] <seutje> lol, the CLI tool crashed my terminal :(
[06:30:21] <TheWhisper> Hi, I'm trying to get the clicked element to print in the console, but it's not working: http://hastebin.com/azoluyexoj.mel
[06:30:29] <TheWhisper> It just prints window
[06:30:49] <TheWhisper> I figure this is because the selector is window
[06:30:59] <TheWhisper> but the plugin developer said it works fine for him like this
[06:31:31] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: How are you triggering that event?
[06:31:52] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell, http://4nf.org/pronto/
[06:32:45] <Cork> NoiseEee: no using $($.parseHTML('<p>foo</p>')); is actually recommended
[06:33:13] <Cork> NoiseEee: $('<p>foo</p>') works fine $(' <p>foo</p>') doesn't
[06:33:25] <NoiseEee> Cork: i guess its different circumstances. when i create a new element, i want a reference to it.
[06:33:27] <Cork> $($.parseHTML(' <p>foo</p>')); works
[06:33:41] <Cork> NoiseEee: you do get a reference to it
[06:34:01] <NoiseEee> p = $('<p>').text('whatUp');  p.on('click',function() { })
[06:35:29] <TheWhisper> BillCriswell: https://github.com/arvgta/ajaxify/issues/18
[06:35:29] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: You'd need to provide all your code. What you're doing seems like it should work.
[06:35:42] <TheWhisper> hm
[06:35:47] <TheWhisper> Okay, lemme push it live
[06:36:01] <Cork> NoiseEee: p = $($.parseHTML('<p></p>')).text('whatUp');  p.on('click',function() { }) works too
[06:36:21] <Cork> NoiseEee: the point is you should be careful with passing html to $()
[06:36:28] <NoiseEee> Cork: fair enough, i'll stick to my old fashioned ways
[06:36:32] <BillCriswell> Try to set up a very small demo with only the necessities, for about 50% of people that usually helps them solve it.
[06:36:34] <Cork> as it won't support all formats
[06:36:59] <Cork> NoiseEee: i do $(html) too
[06:37:06] <Cork> but that is cause i control what is passed to it
[06:37:16] <NoiseEee> yes me too for the most part
[06:37:17] <TheWhisper> PMed you BillCriswell
[06:37:28] <Cork> NoiseEee: but if you have third party generating the html
[06:37:36] <Cork> and if they might have spaces at the beginning
[06:37:40] <NoiseEee> yeah for sure
[06:37:40] <Cork> then you want $.parseHTML()
[06:38:18] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: This seems to be doing what you want?
[06:38:33] <TheWhisper> It's returning "object window" as the clicked element though
[06:38:46] <TheWhisper> And not the actual anchor that I've clicked
[06:39:42] <BillCriswell> How about $(window).on('pronto.request', 'a', function(){ ... });
[06:41:04] <TheWhisper> Function doesn't fire at all then
[06:43:02] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: What is this plugin even doing?
[06:43:12] <TheWhisper> ajax stuff
[06:43:18] <TheWhisper> All of it out of the box
[06:45:26] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: I'd have to read the docs on this plugin, something I'm not up for now. event.target should be what initiated the bubbling up to the element with the event handler. It must not work the way you're thinking.
[06:48:53] <logikos> I'm trying to select all radio buttons with the same name as one that was clicked (this)
[06:49:43] <logikos> i tried doing .closest('form').find('input[name='+radiobuttonname+']')
[06:49:54] <logikos> however the radiobutton name in this case has [] 's inside it
[06:50:04] <logikos> so that doesnt seem to be working
[06:50:19] <logikos> is there an easy way to just select all radio buttons in the same 'set' as a specific one ?
[06:51:22] <BillCriswell> logikos: You can wrap it in quotes.
[06:51:27] <sig> hi, anyone for pointer in updating data in flot? Say I have new data coming in, and it may or may not have same units. I re-generate the y-axes every time. Should this be doable? As in, plot.getOptions().yaxes = newYAxes;
[06:51:29] <logikos> i could i supose make sure that all radio buttons in a set have the same class
[06:51:33] <logikos> hmm, ty BillCriswell
[06:51:35] <logikos> good idea
[06:51:43] <logikos> double quotes or single? or doesnt mater?
[06:52:01] <BillCriswell> I'd use double, just to avoid having to do \.
[06:52:20] <sig> this doesn't work so well for the simple reason that I want to carry some extra stuff along with the axes; and it seems flot uses plot.getYAxes() internally instead of plot.getOptions().yaxes
[06:52:47] <logikos> well if i used single i would change the outer quotes to double for the same reason but good to know that it doesnt mater then, thanks for the help
[06:53:18] <BillCriswell> logikos: Also, if you want to avoid concatenation all together you can do: .find('input').filter(function(){ return this.name === radiobuttonname })
[06:53:58] <logikos> nice
[06:54:16] <logikos> i havent played with filter, that is sweet and gives me a lot more control over things
[06:54:18] <logikos> ty
[06:54:24] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[06:54:52] <BillCriswell> String concatenation just bothers me a lot more than it should.
[06:55:23] <logikos> it doesn't bother me at all, but i like how you used the filter so i'm gonna go with that anyways
[06:55:37] <logikos> allows for real code logic rather than just css selector
[06:55:47] <BillCriswell> Word.
[06:56:06] <logikos> although because of that it is likely a tad slower, but in this case it wont be noticed
[06:57:00] <krambiorix> how can i check if an element is behind another element?
[06:58:37] <BillCriswell> logikos: Yeah. It always depends haha.
[06:59:16] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Would z-index be enough?
[07:00:46] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, nope :s
[07:00:50] <krambiorix> i'm trying with offset() now
[07:01:08] <KptainJulian> \nick K
[07:01:32] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Are they fixed, absolute?
[07:02:08] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, absolute, but i solved it already with offset().left + width
[07:02:18] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, thanks  (got to go)
[07:02:22] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: and you can tell which one is on top?
[07:02:56] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[07:16:43] <paulvd> hello, i am trying to move a ul sub menu to another div, but its not happening here http://tinyurl.com/lsq7kee
[07:16:46] <paulvd> its a hidden div
[07:19:05] <BillCriswell> paulvd: I'd try to replicate the issue on jsbin.com
[07:21:46] <Ownix> Anyone know why im getting "undefined is not a function? http://jsfiddle.net/2j3vs/3/"
[07:22:28] <paulvd> in jsfiddle it works
[07:22:36] <BillCriswell> Ownix: Where did you define .effect?
[07:23:51] <Ownix> BillCriswell: is that not a built in jquery ui function?
[07:25:29] <BillCriswell> Ownix: Apparently it is, but I don't see jquery ui included.
[07:25:43] <Ownix> BillCriswell: I forgot to tick the box, I ticked it, and still nothing
[07:26:08] <Ownix> Am I going to need to write an animation block with a callback to do another animation to toggle a "highlight" class?
[07:26:11] <Ownix> seems like over kill
[07:30:43] <BillCriswell> Ownix: What is your goal here?
[07:30:56] <BillCriswell> You want to toggle a class on comment?
[07:31:00] <BillCriswell> on .comment*
[07:37:47] <logikos> http://codepen.io/Logikos/pen/JBjzx - the <input> would normally be hidden but i didn't hide it so we could see what is going on, if you notice the event on line 59 of the js it triggers weather you click the new button or the label, or the input, but it only toggels the  real radio button set if you click the button not the label or the input
[07:37:50] <logikos> what am i missing
[07:38:25] <logikos> i'm console.log 'ing the input to make sure i'm selecting the right thing, and even the checked property after changing it, and it looks like its working both wasy
[07:38:27] <logikos> but it isnt
[07:38:54] <BillCriswell> logikos: SHould probably be using .on('change'
[07:39:30] <BillCriswell> Er, answered too fast maybe.
[07:39:32] <BillCriswell> I need a nap.
[07:39:59] <logikos> the event fires when i click any part of it .. the input, the label, or the button .. all wraped in a span (which the event is bound to)
[07:40:19] <airdem> shouldnt the second console.log return the same as the first one? http://jsfiddle.net/d7y35/1/
[07:40:22] <logikos> i considered useing change event but didnt see why i should need it beings the event is fireing
[07:40:46] <logikos> the console.log on line 65 outputs the value of the checked property
[07:40:48] <logikos> however it lies
[07:41:04] <logikos> line 63 outputs the object so that i know i'm selecting the righ tthing
[07:41:17] <logikos> line 64 should 'change' the radio
[07:41:32] <logikos> line 65 outputs true meaning it DID change the radio, however it didnt....
[07:41:38] <logikos> only if i click the button
[07:41:41] <logikos> not the input or label
[07:41:47] <logikos> will it really really change the radio
[07:41:48] <logikos> value
[07:43:13] <BillCriswell> logikos: Can we start from the top with your goal?
[07:44:06] <airdem> $(this).nextAll('div').first(); is there a better way to find the next occurence of div?
[07:44:16] <zylophone> question: i have a method in which i build up a html string via a few templates, but then i add some html using jquery to the middle of the existing html and it seems that this html is not in the html - is this right?
[07:44:23] <BillCriswell> airdem: .next('div') ?
[07:44:28] <logikos> yes, my goal is bigger than this example obviously ... but simplified .. i want to hide the real radio buttons, display things that look like radio buttons that are easier to style, and when they are clicked, change the fake radio buttons along with the value of the real radio buttons so that when i seralize() i get the right values
[07:44:50] <airdem> BillCriswell, there are other elements between this and 'div'
[07:45:09] <BillCriswell> airdem: Ah, ok. Yeah, your way is the way that comes to mind then.
[07:45:38] <airdem> i thought closest would do the job but i just found out that it works a little different than i thought it would
[07:45:45] <airdem> .closest()
[07:45:46] <BillCriswell> logikos: How about styling a label?
[07:45:56] <BillCriswell> airdem: That would be for ancestors, not siblings.
[07:46:45] <Ridha> How can I use event with form of input search in jjquerymobile^
[07:46:52] <airdem> BillCriswell, so .nextAll('div').first(); and .siblings('div').first(); would be the same?
[07:46:56] <DarsVaeda> I have a svg element on my page and can select paths, can I bind mouse events to the paths? because I did and it does not fire
[07:46:56] <Ridha> ?
[07:47:07] <zylophone> e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/7F2Nv/
[07:49:19] <netiul> i need to bind a click event to a not yet visible (it's not in the dom) element, but I only have a jquery selector object, can I still delegate somehow?
[07:49:33] <BillCriswell> airdem: .siblings() might work if all siblings are to the right. I think nextAll() is a much better approach.
[07:49:36] <BillCriswell> logikos: http://jsbin.com/wayodaco/1/edit?html,css,output
[07:49:56] <airdem> BillCriswell, you're right, thank you for clarifying
[07:50:02] <BillCriswell> No problem
[07:50:09] <DarsVaeda> ah I can do "path.on()" but not "container.on('click', path)"
[07:51:05] <zylophone> netiul: use .on
[07:52:21] <netiul> zylophone, I do, but the 2nd argument expects a string, but I only have a jquery selector object
[07:52:40] <BillCriswell> logikos: http://jsbin.com/wayodaco/2/edit?html,css,output Some fake radio buttons.
[07:53:32] <netiul> zylophone, it doesnt take this: $( document ).on( "click", myObj, function(){} );
[07:55:34] <netiul> not to convert the object to selector string somehow i guess
[07:55:58] <netiul> s/not/need
[07:56:53] <logikos> BillCriswell: i understand your example but it does not solve my problem.  I'm trying to use jquery ui's themed icons, codepen's jquery ui icon sprite isnt loading properly so yes it looks like i'm just trying to change the background color of a box...
[07:57:00] <logikos> i have simplified my example some
[07:57:01] <logikos> http://codepen.io/Logikos/pen/JBjzx
[07:57:30] <logikos> now if you notice there is only one event on line 5
[07:57:53] <logikos> it fires if you click anywhere inside that span (which contains the input, label, and button)
[07:58:02] <logikos> if you click overtop of the button, everything works as expected
[07:58:13] <logikos> however if you click the label or input the event fires
[07:58:23] <logikos> but it does not change the value of the radio
[07:58:59] <logikos> see the issue?
[08:04:46] <zylophone> how can i append one string of html to another using jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/7F2Nv/1/
[08:05:50] <NoiseEee> zylophone: concatenate the strings first.
[08:06:12] <NoiseEee> var toInsert = str + html;
[08:06:28] <miCSu> I have a php page, which has js console.log(query);$.post(window.location.href, query, function(data) { console.log(data); }); and on top of that page (in php) <?php print_r($_POST); ?> and the first console.log prints all the variables fine but inside success function I get only Array(). Any idea how that could be ?
[08:06:30] <BillCriswell> logikos: Not really. Terrible at following things.
[08:07:01] <miCSu> naturally it also prints the rest of the page html etc
[08:07:45] <zylophone> NoiseEee?
[08:09:47] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/7F2Nv/2/ @ zylophone (sorry misread your question the first time)
[08:10:55] <zylophone> ahh, well atm, i'm just building an html string inside a function, not wanting to insert it anywhere yet
[08:11:04] <zylophone> so, it isn't hitting the dom yet
[08:11:13] <brunoais> miCSu, are you sure all is correct?
[08:11:24] <brunoais> miCSu, what's the content type of the answer?
[08:12:41] <miCSu> brunoais: the content type? It prints the html of that page
[08:13:33] <brunoais> miCSu, let me get this straight. You are sending pure HTML on an answer from an AJAX call?
[08:14:17] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/7F2Nv/4/ @ zylophone
[08:14:44] <patteh> Hi all, i'm using a jquery function to apply smooth scrolling to anchor links on a single page site
[08:15:02] <patteh> is there any way i can add an offset to the anchor top based on the page width?
[08:15:34] <patteh> on the mobile version my slide down nav is adding a 165px margin to anchor locations
[08:15:45] <miCSu> brunoais: nope, thought you meant the data gotten with success function by "answer". The query printed before posting seems correct to me: param1=value1&param2=multi+word+value&param3....
[08:16:49] <brunoais> miCSu, is that what the server answers?
[08:18:50] <miCSu> brunoais: no, it returns Array() and the rest of the html of that page, while it is calling window.location.href
[08:19:25] <brunoais> miCSu, sounds like a php problem than javascript problem
[08:20:18] <BillCriswell> patteh: Hmmm...
[08:20:35] <iDevelop> miCSu: that means it's an empty array
[08:20:47] <iDevelop> i.e. no items
[08:22:00] <patteh> BillCriswell if i add the 165px offset to my scrolling function it shifts the problem over to desktop versions
[08:22:20] <BillCriswell> patteh: Yeah, trying to think of a clean way to approach that.
[08:22:38] <BillCriswell> patteh: I mean for a quick fix you can adjust a class on the body depending on browser width.
[08:23:17] <zylophone> NoiseEee: interesting - thanks
[08:23:17] <patteh> i set a class for the anchor tags which i added and removed a margin-top on based on browser width but it didnt work
[08:23:52] <Colonel_Panic> hey brunoais
[08:23:59] <Colonel_Panic> I have a question for you
[08:24:09] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, sure
[08:24:20] <Colonel_Panic> remember the example we were working on?
[08:24:54] <Colonel_Panic> This was your solution: http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/VgCZL/59/
[08:24:59] <miCSu> iDevelop: yeah, I know. That's why I'm confused 'cause the post method sends query with values. Maybe brunoais is right and the problem's with php. Thanks anyway
[08:25:27] <iDevelop> miCSu: can I see your full source? html and js
[08:26:04] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, yes
[08:26:19] <Colonel_Panic> From that JSON array, I want to get the string names that correspond to each of those values
[08:26:28] <BillCriswell> patteh: Where you're doing the offset calculation you can do like var offset = $(el).offset().top + ( $(window).width() > 500 ? 0 : 165 ); or something along those lines.
[08:26:59] <Colonel_Panic> my idea is to use those as the css class names so the classes can be dynamically applied to the table cells as the table is generated
[08:27:10] <patteh> okay BillCriswell i'll give it a whirl
[08:27:11] <patteh> ty
[08:27:12] <Colonel_Panic> does that make sense?
[08:27:38] <NoiseEee> zylophone: np
[08:28:01] <krambiorix> is it possible to prevent the user from clicking very fast on a button?
[08:28:27] <Colonel_Panic> That way the same function could be reusable for any table row generated off a JSON object
[08:28:31] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: You can throttle it... or add a disabled attribute to it for X seconds.
[08:28:47] <Colonel_Panic> its css classes would be named after the string names
[08:28:47] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, throttle?
[08:29:00] <Colonel_Panic> Does that make sense?
[08:29:31] <BillCriswell> It would be a timeout that basically only lets the handler fire once every x seconds.
[08:31:03] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, ups. I didn't know you had already made the question.
[08:31:33] <Colonel_Panic> So as long as the JSON content was structured the same way, that function would build a table row for each JSON object with each TD cell being classified according to the string name and would contain the string value as its contents
[08:31:36] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, yeah
[08:31:39] <brunoais> it can
[08:31:47] <brunoais> depends on the use-cases that you want to cover
[08:32:16] <Colonel_Panic> but how to I grab that string name?
[08:33:11] <BillCriswell> patteh: If you want to keep things a little more DRY you can use this approach: http://jsbin.com/kayezoso/1/edit?css,js,output
[08:33:31] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I didn't get enough in order to be able to answer you :S. Can you explain better?
[08:33:45] <BillCriswell> It's like basically naming the breakpoints in your CSS and using that name in Javascript.
[08:34:02] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[08:34:29] <Colonel_Panic> the JSON objects consist of a series of string names with corresponding values
[08:34:32] <Colonel_Panic> correct?
[08:34:57] <BillCriswell> Then you could do like: offset + (getBreakpoint() === 'small' ? 200 : 0); so if you change your breakpoint size you don't have to change your JS as well.
[08:35:59] <Colonel_Panic> for example,:  "carrierName": "ProHealth"
[08:36:21] <Colonel_Panic> "carrierName" is the string name, "ProHealth" is the value
[08:36:47] <Colonel_Panic> am I expressing this in the correct terminology?
[08:37:36] <Colonel_Panic> WHat I want to do is this: as the tabled cells are being generated by the function,
[08:37:46] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Yeah. It's "kinda" a key->value thing
[08:38:02] <patteh> okay ty BillCriswell just trying to get your solution to work with current smoothscroll function atm
[08:38:05] <patteh> ty
[08:38:12] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:38:39] <Colonel_Panic> I want to do an "addClass" with the string (or "key," if you will) as the classname
[08:39:22] <Colonel_Panic> that way each cell would be classified according to what column it's in and I can apply styles accordingly
[08:39:42] <Colonel_Panic> see what I'm saying?
[08:40:30] <Colonel_Panic> But how do I capture the key name from each key : value pair in the JSON object?
[08:40:42] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, As it is a SET, there's no defined order
[08:40:49] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[08:40:54] <brunoais> you can get the rows messedup
[08:42:00] <Colonel_Panic> but we're already getting each value,  putting it into an array, and then outputting it into the TD contents
[08:42:29] <Colonel_Panic> All I want to do is grab the key name also, and do an "addClass" with the key name as the class name
[08:42:47] <guzzlefry> Is it possible to view the event handlers for a given element?
[08:42:50] <Colonel_Panic> does that make sense?
[08:42:54] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you can place, instead of strings, in the value of each element of the object, another object that has the key "class": "classname" and "text":"actual text"
[08:43:01] <brunoais> , for example
[08:43:16] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[08:43:16] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, don't do it
[08:43:18] <brunoais> it's a mess
[08:43:30] <Colonel_Panic> That's not what I'm talking about
[08:43:37] <Colonel_Panic> and I agree, that would be a mess
[08:43:55] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, in my code, I already know the keys I'm looking for
[08:44:00] <brunoais> They are in the array
[08:44:04] <Colonel_Panic> Take a look at what the table row-building function is doing there
[08:44:08] <Colonel_Panic> right
[08:44:14] <Colonel_Panic> you know the keys
[08:44:27] <brunoais> yep
[08:44:42] <Colonel_Panic> but how can I get the key names as an array?
[08:44:51] <brunoais> I could even make it such that I get the keys from the table header element
[08:44:54] <brunoais> *elements
[08:45:09] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Hum?
[08:45:22] <Colonel_Panic> I want to classify each successive TD with the key name of its contents
[08:45:29] <Colonel_Panic> so, for example,
[08:46:22] <Colonel_Panic> when the function creates the TD containing "ProHealth," it would then addClass("carrierName") to that same cell
[08:46:29] <Colonel_Panic> for purposes of CSS styling
[08:47:33] <Colonel_Panic>  then when the function creates the next TD containing "Be Well Basic," it would then addClass("planName") to that cell, and so on
[08:48:01] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, this? http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/62/
[08:49:52] <Colonel_Panic> Yes
[08:49:59] <Colonel_Panic> So then I can do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/64/
[08:50:26] <Colonel_Panic> See how it makes the column headers and contents line up micely?
[08:50:28] <Colonel_Panic> nicely
[08:56:06] <Colonel_Panic> But look... every time we sort the table, it ruins the nice zebra striping. That can be fixed so: http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/68/
[08:58:24] <Colonel_Panic> I think the next thing to do would be to fix the numerical sorting issue that returns 50000 as being a greater value than 250000
[08:58:56] <Colonel_Panic> It's apparently ignoring the decimal places
[08:59:22] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, about losing the stripes when sorting is fixed by re-calling the code that re-applies the classes
[08:59:36] <brunoais> just copy&paste and make the necessary adjustment
[08:59:44] <Colonel_Panic> OK, I'll make a function to do that
[08:59:48] <brunoais> otherwise, use jsut CSS for that
[08:59:54] <brunoais> *just use
[08:59:56] <Colonel_Panic> instead of reiterating the code, thanks
[09:00:33] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, about sorting failing, I already told you how you can fix it :)
[09:02:48] <lianzinho> guys, whay this is selecting ALL the a tags?
[09:02:49] <lianzinho> http://jsfiddle.net/e9hRn/
[09:02:58] <Colonel_Panic> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/69/
[09:03:12] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/69/
[09:03:25] * brunoais checking
[09:03:25] <lianzinho> shoundnt it select only the first one? what's wrong with the selector?
[09:04:16] <brunoais> lianzinho, is that even a valid selector?
[09:04:21] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: do I need to use a conditional to determine whether it's a numerical or alphabetical string, or can I just sort for numerics first and the alphabetics?
[09:04:38] <BillCriswell> brunoais: !
[09:04:50] <Colonel_Panic> I meant to say *and then by alphabetics*
[09:04:56] <shoky> lianzinho: $("a[data-projeto-ementa]")
[09:05:22] <BillCriswell> brunoais: My bad, meant lianzinho
[09:06:14] <BillCriswell> shoky: Think he wants the ones without a data-projete-ementa attribute.
[09:06:25] <shoky> then why !=''  ?
[09:06:29] <doug65536> BillCriswell: no, it's !=
[09:06:38] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you can't. You can check if it is a number or not in the callback itself or before doing the sort assuming all is the same as the 1st one
[09:06:39] <shoky> he wants only the first
[09:06:56] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, it depends on how that may be used
[09:06:57] <BillCriswell> Totally missed that line.
[09:07:24] <Colonel_Panic> Right
[09:07:26] <lianzinho> I saw it in tje qtip plugin site
[09:07:38] <lianzinho> it's a different than
[09:07:52] <brunoais> lianzinho, is it this? http://jsfiddle.net/e9hRn/1/
[09:07:52] <lianzinho> should select all the a which have this attribute non blank
[09:08:00] <BillCriswell> I wish I could store some variables in CSS.
[09:08:09] <shoky> lianzinho: all the <a>s have that attribute being different than ''
[09:08:12] <BillCriswell> than I can access in jQuery later.
[09:08:20] <BillCriswell> Preferably an object or an array.
[09:08:22] <Colonel_Panic> In this scenario, all content in the column will always be the same type unless the JSON string gets jacked-up somehow
[09:08:32] <Cork> BillCriswell: just wait a little while and you can
[09:08:33] <BillCriswell> Access in javascript later*
[09:08:49] <BillCriswell> Cork: Really? Any resource on that?
[09:09:02] <duch_kazatel> CSS variables?
[09:09:05] <Cork> ?g csswg var
[09:09:06] <b-ot> Cork: CSS Custom Properties for Cascading Variables Module Level 1 → http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables/
[09:09:07] <lianzinho> http://qtip2.com/guides#content.attribute
[09:09:13] <brunoais> lianzinho, or this? http://jsfiddle.net/e9hRn/2/
[09:09:19] <lianzinho> look at the custom attribute, they use !=
[09:09:20] <doug65536> there's no control flow though - you must mean constants, right?
[09:09:24] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables
[09:09:58] <Cork> doug65536: no you can set values
[09:10:06] <Cork> but ya it is declaration so no flow
[09:10:18] <shoky> lianzinho:  if the element doesnt have the attribute, it's considered non-blank.  in the qtip they are looking for elements that DO have the attribute
[09:10:34] <guzzlefry> Are there any good alternatives to jQuery UI's dialog? Lots of strange things happening with this 3rd-party product and it. >_>
[09:10:41] <Colonel_Panic> But if I were to check for numerical or alphabetical in the callback, I would use parseInt() for that?
[09:10:55] <shoky> lianzinho oh i misread their example
[09:11:07] <lianzinho> shoky:
[09:11:08] <lianzinho> no
[09:11:09] <Cork> duch_kazatel: but you can do quite a lot of things in combination with calc()
[09:11:12] <BillCriswell> I'm familiar with those. I was thinking in terms of like: media = {}; @media ( min-width: 400px ) { media.width = 'medium'; } @media ( min-height: 500px ) { media.height = 'tall' } then being able to access media in Javascript.
[09:11:14] <doug65536> Colonel_Panic: or a regex test
[09:11:16] <lianzinho> you are right, I solved
[09:11:27] <doug65536> Colonel_Panic: if you want to be strict
[09:11:40] <lianzinho> it was what you said… I got confused  because I changed the example a little bit… thanks
[09:11:42] <Cork> BillCriswell: css var is meant to be accessable from js
[09:12:01] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you can use parseInt to see if it is numerical
[09:12:03] <BillCriswell> Cork: So I can use them outside of properties? Nice.
[09:12:11] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, if it is, then process as such
[09:12:28] <Cork> BillCriswell: well i have mixed feelings about it
[09:12:29] <shoky> lianzinho: their example seems wrong then..
[09:12:37] <Cork> but yes that is part of the spec
[09:12:42] <Colonel_Panic> else, go on to the current sorting method?
[09:13:09] <BillCriswell> Cork: How do you keep certain things from happening in Javascript based on certain browser conditions?
[09:13:22] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, it's just 4 more lines of code
[09:13:29] <Cork> BillCriswell: what do you mean?
[09:13:35] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, 2 are used for a comparison
[09:13:47] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, an "if", to be exact. if you want
[09:14:08] <BillCriswell> Like, my "medium" screen breakpoint may change, if I only want something happening in JS at that medium breakpoint I need to change my CSS and JS.
[09:14:45] <Cork> BillCriswell: don't follow
[09:15:11] <Cork> BillCriswell: css var will be set on the element matching the selector setting the value
[09:15:36] <Cork> BillCriswell: js has to actively check the value
[09:15:55] <Cork> kinda like you would use .data() for data- attributes
[09:17:15] <BillCriswell> Cork: http://jsbin.com/kayezoso/1/edit?css,js
[09:19:23] <Cork> BillCriswell: ok?
[09:20:15] <BillCriswell> Cork: I might have missed something.
[09:20:17] <BillCriswell> Usually do.
[09:20:45] <Cork> BillCriswell: your checking the :before on each resize
[09:21:02] <BillCriswell> So you're saying I'd be able to do like body.whatever in JS and it would get a variable I set in CSS.
[09:21:03] <Cork> only difference is that you would check the data value instead
[09:21:13] <Cork> BillCriswell: yes
[09:21:18] <BillCriswell> DUh. Ok.
[09:21:26] <BillCriswell> Well, I am looking forward to that.
[09:21:34] <Cork> if i remember correctly it was elm.style.var. or something like that
[09:21:57] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[09:22:46] <BillCriswell> This approach works a bit but it can get messy if I wanted to add like @media ( min-height: 500px ) { body:after { content: 'wide&tall' }); or something.
[09:23:52] <BillCriswell> Cork: http://jsbin.com/kayezoso/3/edit ideally with something like this I'd be able to get large and tall instead of just tall.
[09:25:35] <ajf-> Any idea how to make a submit event synchronous? I'm creating a recaptcha form on .submit, and I must return true/false depending on it, and it also works based on a .submit event, so js is not waiting for the recaptcha submit event and the first submit event is returning undefined, any tips?
[09:26:10] <Cork> BillCriswell: but why not just use matchMedia?
[09:26:28] <duch_kazatel> ajf- why aren't you calling your dependent logic in the done() callback?
[09:26:56] <BillCriswell> Cork: I'd have to manually update numbers wouldn't I?
[09:27:10] <BillCriswell> in CSS and Javascript*
[09:27:24] <ajf-> duch_kazatel: the problem is that the form itself is bound to .submit(), so if on .done() I do form.submit();, then everything just starts over
[09:28:09] <ajf-> and if I return true; on .done(), it is still asynchronous to the first submit event
[09:28:21] <duch_kazatel> ajf- huh?  why are you submitting a form again within its own done() handler?
[09:28:41] <ajf-> I'll gist the code
[09:29:10] <Cork> BillCriswell: hmm ya, but you can use event handlers instead of onresize loops
[09:29:14] <ajf-> it's short =) https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8435d67a477fed0431ca
[09:29:48] <BillCriswell> The on resize was just to show it working. I'd only call "getBreakpoint()" as I needed it.
[09:30:03] <ajf-> I added .not-verified to the form submit event on line 74 because I'm looking into the option of removing that class when recaptcha is successful and then do the .submit()
[09:30:22] <Cork> BillCriswell: window.matchMedia("(orientation: portrait)").addListener(function() {})
[09:31:03] <shoky> ajf- the return on lines 56, 64  are returning from the $.post callback, not from getRecaptcha which has already returned long ago
[09:31:05] <BillCriswell> Cork: Like if my header is fixed at a certain breakpoint I can do like offset - ( getBreapoint() === 'small' ) ? 30 : 0
[09:31:22] <ajf-> shoky: that's my problem. I need this all to be synchronous somehow
[09:31:28] <Cork> BillCriswell: sure, but you need to check it on interval
[09:31:29] <ajf-> So the form waits for the recaptcha's return to submit
[09:31:30] <shoky> ajf- nah you don't.
[09:31:34] <Cork> in your case onresize
[09:31:35] <ajf-> shoky: any ideas?
[09:31:40] <BillCriswell> Cork: I'm not sure I really understand why being able to detect orientation would be useful.
[09:31:54] <Cork> BillCriswell: that was just an example
[09:31:58] <BillCriswell> Cork: why not just when a click happens?
[09:32:07] <Cork> you can get called when width is less the the marker
[09:32:16] <Cork> ah, hmm ok
[09:32:26] <Cork> though you needed to know it when the resize changed
[09:32:32] <shoky> ajf- there are several ways.. simplest is to submit the form by calling .submit() on the native form element  e.g. $form[0].submit()
[09:32:46] <BillCriswell> Cork: I see where matchMedia can be useful for sure.
[09:32:48] <shoky> ajf- then it won't trigger your submit handler
[09:33:02] <ajf-> shoky: ah that's great. Thanks
[09:34:00] <BillCriswell> Cork: I'm slowly seeing more of your point.
[09:34:48] <BillCriswell> So would matchMedia() always be listening or would that only be on load?
[09:35:34] <Cork> BillCriswell: it fires when it changes after you've bound a listener
[09:36:40] <pap0t> anyone know of plugin or script that let me do dynamic forms

[10:23:14] <dwarder> guys, i use chrome to debug websockets, why i don't see updates
[10:23:51] <jyg> dwarder, too vague
[10:24:20] <dwarder> jyg: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15332020/automatically-update-websocket-frame-in-chrome-web-inspector
[10:26:00] <jyg> dwarder, i'm not sure how you inspect a socket, as its not a DOM object but a javascript object
[10:26:16] <jyg> also, websockets is events driven (as javascript is in general)
[10:26:32] <jyg> if you want things to automagically update you've got to bind to the events
[10:26:53] <shoky> you can inspect websocket data in chrome devtools
[10:27:41] <shoky> but as that SO answer says, it doesn't auto-update the view
[10:27:41] <dwarder> shoky: yes, but frames are not updated
[10:27:48] <shoky> yes
[10:27:51] <dwarder> yes ;)
[10:28:03] <dwarder> :(
[10:28:10] <jyg> are you sure they're updating?
[10:28:21] <jyg> (and its just the tool that's not updating?)
[10:28:26] <shoky> jyg yes
[10:28:28] <dwarder> jyg: yes
[10:28:28] <shoky> http://www.websocket.org/echo.html
[10:28:37] <jyg> ah ok
[10:28:41] <jyg> so you see it on page
[10:30:21] <dwarder> jyg: it is google chrome bug
[10:30:23] <dwarder> +a
[10:30:52] <dwarder> jyg: i thought maybe other tools exist that are without this bug
[10:32:03] <shoky> dwarder you can try fiddler
[10:32:26] <MikeD_> if I destroy the contents of a div with $(mydiv).html('');   does it cause problems with jquery events registered on the children that are now gone?  should I explicitly use $(mydiv).off().html(''); or is that implied?
[10:32:44] <skullcrasher> is there a possibilty to limit the jquery draggable option "cancel" to elements that have certain childs?
[10:33:04] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ why not use .remove() ?
[10:33:09] <duch_kazatel> rather, .empty()
[10:33:39] <MikeD_> idk, .html('') sorta worked... didn't know to look for something else.
[10:33:45] <MikeD_> (thanks)
[10:34:00] <skullcrasher> this works almost
[10:34:01] <skullcrasher> http://jsfiddle.net/uPRaH/1/
[10:34:10] <dwarder> shoky: thanks
[10:34:13] <skullcrasher> i thought about :has(child selector)
[10:34:37] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ you shouldn't need to worry about unbinding events, but .empty() in your case is probably a lot smarter :)
[10:34:38] <skullcrasher> but then if any of this items has the child, none of them are draggable
[10:36:30] <skullcrasher> but only the one should be prevented from
[10:39:24] <duch_kazatel> "The beginning of a Mootools validator class. Oh god what have I done."
[10:39:26] <shoky> skullcrasher you can use the "start" event and return false to prevent dragging
[10:39:30] <duch_kazatel> i like my coworkers sometimes.
[10:40:27] <shoky> skullcrasher  http://jsfiddle.net/uPRaH/32/

[10:54:47] <thebope> Whats the deal with gzipping? Is it done server side and uncompressed by the browser client side? I know it's a bit off topic for jquery but this is my favorite channel
[10:55:16] <guzzlefry> thebope: I believe so.
[10:55:21] <duch_kazatel> thebope yep.  that's the idea.
[10:55:36] <thebope> guzzlefry, duch_kazatel sweet thanks, it was just a curiosity thing
[10:56:26] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery addclass
[10:56:28] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .addClass() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/addclass/
[10:56:33] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra read the docs for addclass.
[10:56:39] <guzzlefry> thebope: https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/gzip
[10:56:54] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel I have done that, but it breaks when I try to just add it to the end of the line
[10:57:18] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra huh?
[10:57:25] <thebope> ahh awesome thanks guzzlefry
[10:57:25] <BAMbanda> can someone point me in the right direction for clicking on a (x,y) point and then clicking on another (x,y) point and having a line displayed between those too points. (I'm using flot.js)
[10:57:27] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra you want to add multiple classes, right?
[10:57:29] <thebope> Webmaster, awesome title
[10:58:38] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel - I am editing a script that already adds and removes the class from an element. I am trying to figure out how to extend it to add a class to a _different_ element as well.
[10:58:45] <pecanha> hey guys, I'm trying this jquery blur http://pastebin.com/Rff87tdU . What am I missing?
[10:58:49] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel the working example without the second element is in my paste
[10:59:28] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra then do $('otherelement').addClass('newClass');
[10:59:36] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra within the callback.
[10:59:43] <teamcoltra> When I did that it broke
[10:59:59] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel let me past my version one sec
[11:00:09] <BAMbanda> so no one wants to point me to the right direction?
[11:00:11] <duch_kazatel> could you put it in jsfiddle instead?
[11:00:18] <duch_kazatel> BAMbanda none of us probably know.
[11:00:28] <bberry> i would do $("#thing").parent().attr('id') and not $("#thing").parent().prop('id'), right?
[11:00:34] <bberry> s/would/should/
[11:00:44] <BAMbanda> duch_kazatel, I'm sure someone has to know
[11:00:55] <dwarder> BAMbanda: go home
[11:01:24] <dwarder> BAMbanda: ;)
[11:01:37] <plbyrdWork> Good day.  I'm have a pretty big problem with WIJMO and jQuery UI.  WIJMO automatically registers it's own copy of jQuery 1.9.1 with the ASP.Net script manager and that version of jquery gets pulled in very late in the page lifecycle.  I would be ok with this if it happened earlier in the page lifecycle, but since it's so late I have to register jQuery 1.9.1 and jQuery UI 1.10 early to ensure
[11:01:37] <plbyrdWork> it's available for all of my plugins.  Is there a way to force WIJMO to not register it's jQuery or is there a way delay initializing jQuery plugins until after the framework has been initialized?
[11:01:45] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel http://pastie.org/9150680
[11:01:52] <bberry> is it better to use prop or attr for getting the id? (i assume attr)
[11:02:46] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra ah, yeah you're using that wrong -> http://jsfiddle.net/CKL57/
[11:03:43] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel the original code is minimized would I just add a space?
[11:03:51] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra also, if you have jquery on the page, you can do soemthing like this http://jsfiddle.net/Y85j9/
[11:03:59] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra huh?
[11:04:36] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra if you want to put it in the minimized version, you need to add in the proper semicolons.
[11:04:47] <duch_kazatel> but why you're editing a minified version is beyond me.
[11:05:21] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel because that's what I have. I can't find the original. Maybe I will go through and just clean up the whole file and then minimize it again after I am done.
[11:05:40] <teamcoltra> :) I will give that a shot and maybe play around with it more. Thank you.
[11:06:10] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra if you want to edit it inline, make sure you add semicolons to the end of those statements.  see the fundamental differences between what i had and what you had?
[11:07:17] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel yeah, yours basically created two commands while I was trying to do it all in one go
[11:07:38] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra you can't chain what you were trying to do.
[11:07:47] <duch_kazatel> add in those semis.
[11:07:55] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: you're performing the sort without using the sort() method
[11:08:14] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, no
[11:08:29] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra i'd high suggest learning some more javascript basics either way.
[11:08:33] <teamcoltra> Thanks duch_kazatel - :) You went above and beyond and I always appreciate when people go the extra level to ensure I understand the help instead of just saying "paste this"
[11:09:04] <Colonel_Panic> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/70/
[11:09:16] <Colonel_Panic> I don't see a sort() in there
[11:09:33] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, sortingElements.sort(function(a, b) {
[11:10:10] <Colonel_Panic> ah OK
[11:10:20] <Colonel_Panic> sorry I was out at lunch earlier
[11:10:24] <Colonel_Panic> just got back
[11:17:20] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: I just tried a different approach, but it's still not doing the numbers correctly
[11:17:22] <Colonel_Panic> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/71/
[11:17:46] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I'll be back in a bit. I have to finish this first
[11:20:36] <plbyrdWork> Wouldn't you know it.  I solved my problem 5 minutes after posting here.  I've been working on this for 12 hours.
[11:20:44] <plbyrdWork> Sorry for the noise.  Take care.
[11:20:50] <BillCriswell> plbyrdWork: Sometimes you just need to talk it out haha.
[11:21:00] <BillCriswell> Rubber Ducky it
[11:21:02] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: sorry, I meant this one: http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/72/
[11:24:11] <Colonel_Panic> I see what it's doing here
[11:24:41] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: I see what it's doing here; it's sorting the entire table according to the alphabetics of the first two columns
[11:24:56] <Colonel_Panic> So it gets the numerical columns wrong
[11:35:05] <dp> We're using jquery to make a CORS request, and including an http header in the request. however, the remote never gets the header that's sent. I've reproduced the problem with the following: http://paste2.org/4yVyDttn -- any suggestions on what might be incorrect?
[11:46:00] <shoky> dp: what's the problem..?  and.. that's not jquery code
[11:46:43] <gates> Hello
[11:47:07] <gates> I am using jUI's autocomplete
[11:47:27] <dp> shoky: it's taken from jquery. I've done the minimal amount of code to reproduce it. and I'm not getting the header set in the top
[11:47:33] <gates> and I am trying to modify the results before they're shown
[11:47:47] <gates> http://jsfiddle.net/xn8YJ/9/
[11:47:57] <shoky> dp: in that code no header is being set
[11:48:06] <gates> if you type "jav" youll see the "a" flash towards the right but then change back
[11:48:14] <gates> any thoughts?
[11:48:28] <dp> shoky: "for ( i in headers ) {", xhr.setRequestHeader( i, headers[ i ] + "" );
[11:48:35] <dp> that sets a header, unless I'm mistaken
[11:48:42] <shoky> dp: that never gets called
[11:48:45] <dp> why not?
[11:48:45] <shoky> it's under if
[11:48:54] <shoky> it's under if (options.xhrFields)
[11:48:57] <dp> it's actually not. the paste went wonky
[11:49:05] <dp> that if ends on line 54
[11:49:06] <shoky> oh
[11:49:19] <gates> It looks like the 'ul li' s are changing as you type
[11:49:29] <gates> thus my filters are being replaced
[11:50:06] <shoky> dp: why are you showing this code and not the.. jquery code that produces it?
[11:50:26] <dp> shoky: because it's actually wrapped in a plugin
[11:50:36] <dp> I figured something minimal would be more useful
[11:50:47] <dp> let me see if I can reproduce it just with $.ajax
[11:51:01] <shoky> dp ok and your server responds with CORS headers?
[11:51:19] <shoky> dp and does it also respond to preflight OPTIONS requests?
[11:51:56] <shoky> or are you saying the request goes through fine, and you get the response, but only thing is that the headers weren't sent?
[11:52:22] <dp> shoky: http://paste2.org/DfP5by1V
[11:52:24] <MikeD_> why are the parameters reversed from .each() to .map() ?
[11:52:34] <dp> I have cors headers, and it responds to OPTIONS requests
[11:52:37] <dp> however
[11:52:52] <dp> there's an auth check for the header, and because it doesn't exist, throws an error
[11:54:20] <shoky> what do you mean it doesn't exist?
[11:55:21] <shoky> MikeD_: no good reason except backwards compatibility  afaik
[11:55:36] <MikeD_> haha
[11:55:50] <MikeD_> "backwards" compatibility
[11:56:20] <Colonel_Panic> I have a sorting algorithm that appears to be failing to sort numerics of different decimal lengths
[11:56:44] <Colonel_Panic> ie. it will place 50000 as a higher number than 250000
[11:57:28] <Colonel_Panic> it's doing this because it is sorting by ascii values instead of numeric values
[11:57:31] <MikeD_> your sort is probably turning those into strings
[11:57:46] <Colonel_Panic> yes, they are strings
[11:57:49] <MikeD_> parseInt( number, 10 )
[11:57:59] <Colonel_Panic> for decimal, right?
[11:58:20] <Colonel_Panic> but then what about when I want it to sort the alphanumeric stings?
[11:58:24] <Colonel_Panic> dtrings
[11:58:29] <Colonel_Panic> STRINGS
[11:58:40] <shoky> when you want that, don't parseInt..
[11:58:46] <MikeD_> oh, you want a magicSort()
[11:59:00] <Colonel_Panic> should I use isNumeric() to differentiate?
[11:59:18] <shoky> you should decide if you want to treat them as strings or numbers..
[11:59:54] <Colonel_Panic> well they're parsed from a JSON object and then placed into an array
[11:59:59] <jrm2k6> what is the difference between using $("#idelem") and $("#idelem")[0]
[12:00:00] <jrm2k6> ?
[12:00:05] <shoky> that's irrelevant
[12:00:09] <Colonel_Panic> each table row is a different JSON object
[12:00:27] <Colonel_Panic> some of the values are alphabetical, others are numeric
[12:00:32] <shoky> jrm2k6 the second one gives you the element, the first one gives you the element wrapped in a jquery object
[12:00:39] <Colonel_Panic> http://jsfiddle.net/VgCZL/76/
[12:00:40] <MikeD_> or just toggle through every kind of sort:  asciiASC, asciiDESC, numASC, numDESC, random(), idk.
[12:00:46] <jrm2k6> shoky: ok i see
[12:00:47] <jrm2k6> thanks
[12:01:37] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, are you even thinking on what you are trying instead of just doing something and then get that it does not worl?
[12:01:39] <brunoais> *work
[12:03:19] <Colonel_Panic> Right now I'm trying to figure out an approach that will work.
[12:03:57] <Colonel_Panic> I'm thinking about using isNumeric() to differentiate the numerical values from the alphabetics in the string
[12:04:00] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, let's get your mind straight
[12:04:18] <Colonel_Panic> then proceeding from there to sort accordingly
[12:04:54] <Colonel_Panic> given that there's no single sort method that automatically detects and sorts accordingly
[12:05:55] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, think for a bit
[12:06:25] <brunoais> for starters
[12:06:30] <brunoais> why did you do what you did do?
[12:08:51] <dp> shoky: apologies. when I print out all of the request headers from the server side, X-API-KEY doesn't exist
[12:09:39] <shoky> dp: and what do you see in the devtools network tab
[12:10:37] <dp> shoky: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0nshjaugjwh1zpv/Screenshot%202014-05-07%2015.10.32.png
[12:10:42] <dp> brb
[12:10:47] <Colonel_Panic> Instead of trying to justify my mistakes, I'd rather try to understand what steps I need to take to accomplish this task and then write code to do that
[12:11:00] <shoky> dp: oh. the header won't appear in the OPTIONS request
[12:11:41] <shoky> dp: the OPTIONS request is sent by the browser, you don't have control over it
[12:12:00] <Colonel_Panic> revisiting the stuff I tried that didn't work will not help me move forward in the direction of a solution
[12:12:22] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I won't tell you the answer even if this takes 1 month
[12:12:33] <brunoais> I'll just try to help you in your logic
[12:12:38] <Colonel_Panic> I'm not asking you to tell me the answer
[12:12:40] <dp> shoky: but I'm still not seeing it on the server side log
[12:12:47] <shoky> dp: not seeing what?
[12:12:50] <dp> the header
[12:12:52] <Colonel_Panic> First of all, in this sorting mechanism I need to differentiate between numbers and words
[12:12:54] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Let's split this into parts
[12:12:57] <dp> X-API-KEY
[12:13:00] <shoky> dp: it's not supposed to be there in the OPTIONS request
[12:13:06] <dp> erm
[12:13:10] <Colonel_Panic> because those data types need to be addressed differently
[12:13:12] <dp> why not?
[12:13:18] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, while breaking into parts as small as possible, what are this problem's parts?
[12:13:24] <shoky> dp: because the OPTIONS request is sent by the browser. you're not the one sending it
[12:13:49] <dp> hrm. ok. so I need to add some logic to my header checker
[12:14:33] <Colonel_Panic> 1. look at the content of the first entry in the column to be sorted (that was determined by a click in that column's header)
[12:15:14] <Colonel_Panic> 2. identify the data type of the first entry in that column
[12:15:51] <aarkerio> hi!  How can I execute a $.ajax({   block inside a function?
[12:16:00] <Colonel_Panic> 3. If the data is numeric, then parse the string as an integer and perform a sort routine
[12:16:23] <Cork> aarkerio: execute it inside a function?
[12:16:43] <shoky> dp: yeah. you can see in that screenshot that the OPTIONS is being sent in the first place in order to ask the server if its ok to send a request with that custom header.  "Access-Control-Request-Headers: x-api-key"
[12:16:44] <Cork> aarkerio: just call $.ajax and it will make the ajax call
[12:16:44] <Colonel_Panic> 4. otherwise, perform the sort routine without parsing the string as an integer
[12:16:56] <Colonel_Panic> Does that sound right to you?
[12:17:01] <aarkerio> Ok, thanks!
[12:17:17] <Cork> aarkerio: what are you trying to do?
[12:17:26] <Cork> aarkerio: that question doesn't make sense
[12:17:50] <Azrael_-> hi
[12:18:25] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: does that sound right?
[12:18:33] <Azrael_-> i'm using this test-form http://jsbin.com/facepava/1/edit my problem: i want it to accept also "0,4" as a number as this is the german format but i have no clue how i could achieve this. can you give me a hint?
[12:20:19] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I sais as small as possible
[12:20:25] <brunoais> *said
[12:21:15] <shoky> brunoais what do you want from the man.. his list seems mostly reasonable to me
[12:21:25] <yakko> hey guys, I'm looking for a jquery plugin, maybe somebody has seen something like it. I need to make a Grid that behaves like iOS, you should be able to rearange items, as well as drop an item on top of another to make a group, has anybody seen anything like it please? super thanks in advance :)
[12:21:37] <brunoais> shoky, naw. It is too high level
[12:21:49] <shoky> how the hell is he supposed to know what level you want from him?
[12:22:01] <brunoais> shoky, even I don't split problems into such high level concepts
[12:22:16] <shoky> huh?
[12:22:23] <brunoais> shoky, I said as small/simple as possible
[12:22:33] <brunoais> it's js, so you cannot go to C leve
[12:22:35] <brunoais> *leve
[12:22:38] <brunoais> *level
[12:22:52] <shoky> you've lost me
[12:25:17] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: I guess the first thing I need to do is get the content of sortingElements[i] within the while loop
[12:25:47] <Colonel_Panic> for the current iteration
[12:25:55] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, what while loop?
[12:26:24] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, oh. The one I made?
[12:26:48] <Colonel_Panic> wait... no that won't work because determining the type of data needs to be done before we even get to that point
[12:26:59] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, why?
[12:27:50] <Colonel_Panic> if I determine the kind of data there, then where am I going to implement the parseInt() function?
[12:28:11] <shoky> dp: btw what php web framework is that ?
[12:28:15] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, parseInt() is part of the methods in the window object
[12:28:23] <Colonel_Panic> The parseInt() method would need to be implemented in a separate function
[12:28:40] <Colonel_Panic> and then called if needed
[12:29:06] <Colonel_Panic> before proceeding to the sort() algorithm
[12:29:16] <Colonel_Panic> right?
[12:29:43] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, no
[12:29:53] <brunoais> why implement as a separate function?
[12:30:56] <dp> shoky: Slim Framework
[12:31:03] <Colonel_Panic> because it's only going to be used in some cases
[12:31:14] <Colonel_Panic> not for all data
[12:31:21] <Colonel_Panic> only the numerical type
[12:32:02] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, how do you know if certain data is numeric?
[12:32:39] <Colonel_Panic> brunoais: I can check that by means of the isNumeric() method
[12:33:26] <Colonel_Panic> The reason I'm approaching this from a "high level" is because I need to understand the basic of what needs to be done before I can start to think about the nitty-gritty steps of how to get there
[12:34:19] <Colonel_Panic> If you want to go somewhere, it helps to have a map before you start deciding where to start stepping with each damn foot
[12:34:30] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, I've never seen such method in javascript
[12:34:40] <Colonel_Panic> it's a JQuery method
[12:34:45] <brunoais> I always start on the details
[12:34:58] <ryanwhit> jquery-ui question if anyone is knowledgable. for a draggable element, does the scroll: true property only apply to it being dragged within a fixed height box with visibility:scroll, or should that work to scroll the entire browser window if dragged to the bottom as well?
[12:35:24] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, the world is made out of details, so it's where where I always start
[12:35:27] <Colonel_Panic> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.isnumeric/
[12:35:42] <Colonel_Panic> Well I guess different people approach problems differently
[12:37:11] <duch_kazatel> i always start by understanding the real problem, and then componentizing it as much as I can.
[12:37:15] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, jQuery's way is different than mine and both work
[12:37:26] <brunoais> mine's as reliable as jQuery's
[12:37:33] <brunoais> if you want to use jQuery's just use it
[12:37:33] <shoky> dp: thx
[12:37:34] <Colonel_Panic> A house can be made out of bricks, but I find it helps to have a visual concept of what the finished structure is intended to look like, before you start laying bricks
[12:37:49] <Colonel_Panic> I don't even know what your method is yet
[12:38:34] <Colonel_Panic> I'm just trying to understand what it is I need to do
[12:38:47] <Colonel_Panic> did my list make sense or not?
[12:39:04] <brunoais> I start from the bricks
[12:39:06] <shoky> (yes)
[12:40:10] <Azrael_-> *sniff*sniff* :(
[12:40:15] <Colonel_Panic> I mean the overview I gave of the process I'm trying to implement. Is that a sane solution, and will it accomplish the task well?
[12:40:15] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, 3 is flawed
[12:40:49] <Colonel_Panic> OK, then what's the problem with it?
[12:40:52] <brunoais> There's no way to parse it as an integer first
[12:41:05] <rindolf> Hi all.
[12:41:11] <Colonel_Panic> Does it have something to do with that step being in two parts?
[12:41:12] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, you have to do it before making the comparison of which one is the highest
[12:41:21] <Colonel_Panic> OK
[12:41:58] <Colonel_Panic> So it can just be built into the sorting algorithm itself?
[12:42:31] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, in the sorting condition? Yes
[12:42:36] <Colonel_Panic> is it really necessary to put it inside that loop, forcing the check every time?
[12:42:51] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, that depends on the data that can appear
[12:43:08] <Colonel_Panic> can't it just check the first value in the column, decide whether or not to parseInt(), then proceed accordingly?
[12:43:08] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, if you know it is always consistent, then no
[12:43:37] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, yes. That's why 1. and 2. are not flawed
[12:43:46] <Colonel_Panic> well I'm assuming all the data entries in one table column will always be of the same type
[12:44:43] <Colonel_Panic> I know it needs to be done before making the comparison
[12:45:30] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, Are you sure there are not going to be names that start with numbers (or so)?
[12:45:35] <Colonel_Panic> I pointed that out above. That's why I was saying put it before the while loop, or break it out into another function to be called only if needed
[12:45:38] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, if so, then just continue
[12:46:02] <Colonel_Panic> Well, I'm assuming there won't, but you're right
[12:47:12] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, why before the while loop?
[12:47:35] <Colonel_Panic> I suppose some insurance marketing genius might get a wild hair up his ass and decide to name an insurance plan starting with a numeral
[12:49:50] <Colonel_Panic> but if you look at the JQuery API page for the JQuery isNumeric() method, you'll see that it's plenty savvy enough to recognize a mixed string even if it begins with a numeral
[12:49:52] <Colonel_Panic> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.isnumeric/
[12:50:37] <Colonel_Panic> just so long as the marketing genius doesn't decide to name a plan something like "0xFF"
[12:50:47] <stlstude> I'm having difficulty swapping 2 items in jQuery. I've tried detaching, replacing, appending, before/after and I'm missing something. Can someone lend an eye? http://jsfiddle.net/w2Yya/1/
[12:50:47] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, it doesn't show about strings that start with a number
[12:51:07] <duch_kazatel> Colonel_Panic always expect your marketing folks will do the dumbest thing possible.
[12:51:51] <duch_kazatel> stlstude could you put each of those into a container?
[12:51:55] <brunoais> stlstude, just place the element in a different place. the DOM does the rest
[12:52:23] <stlstude> duch_kazatel I did think about that - like adding a class to each
[12:52:35] <stlstude> brunoais - not sure I follow?
[12:52:35] <duch_kazatel> stlstude no, like adding a container around each.
[12:52:49] <brunoais> stlstude, I just checked your code. You are doing it wrong
[12:52:59] <brunoais> stlstude, do you know what .eq() does?
[12:53:02] <Colonel_Panic> Alternatively, I suppose I could accomplish this using regular expressions
[12:53:22] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, if you want to
[12:53:31] <brunoais> Colonel_Panic, it's possible
[12:53:52] <stlstude> brunoais yes
[12:54:06] <duch_kazatel> stlstude http://jsfiddle.net/w2Yya/2/
[12:54:18] <brunoais> stlstude, what does it do?
[12:54:33] <duch_kazatel> stlstude also, do you have a more recent version of jquery you can use?
[12:55:04] <stlstude> brunoais finds by index
[12:55:15] <brunoais> stlstude, finds what?
[12:55:17] <stlstude> and duch_kazatel no i'm handcuffed by old jquery unfrotunately
[12:55:21] <stlstude> fortunately*
[12:55:37] <duch_kazatel> stlstude then do what i did and add a container around each group and call it a day.
[12:56:31] <stlstude> brunoais finds an element. and duch_kazatel ill have to add the container via jquery but i see what you're saying
[12:56:46] <duch_kazatel> stlstude then cache the selectors and move those.
[12:56:46] <brunoais> stlstude, finds an element where?
[12:57:18] <stlstude> duch_kazatel ok, thanks
[12:59:54] <brunoais> pff
[13:00:04] <brunoais> doesn't want to learn <_<
[13:00:39] <duch_kazatel> they might want to, but now may not be a good time.  who knows?!
[13:14:35] <Azrael_-> i'm using this test-form http://jsbin.com/facepava/1/edit my problem: i want it to accept also "0,4" as a number as this is the german format but i have no clue how i could achieve this. can you give me a hint?
[13:26:35] <guzzlefry> So, is the onclick HTML attribute the only way to guarantee that an event handler can't be unbound?
[13:26:52] <duch_kazatel> wut
[13:27:17] <guzzlefry> yah
[13:27:30] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't sound right.  but why?
[13:28:28] <guzzlefry> I think this 3rd-party framework/application's widget is unbinding the click event handler for the link that opens the widget.
[13:28:57] <guzzlefry> No clue if there's a way to view handlers on a given element, but that would help figure this out.
[13:29:32] <duch_kazatel> what framework is it?
[13:29:42] <duch_kazatel> because it sounds like you're doing something a little strange.
[13:29:57] <guzzlefry> It's PHPFox.
[13:30:16] <guzzlefry> Good luck finding any documentation on it. :P
[13:30:59] <duch_kazatel> check out visualevent if you want to see handlers bound to elements.
[13:33:13] <guzzlefry> I'm guessing the one from SpryMedia?
[13:33:36] <duch_kazatel> http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/visual+event yes
[13:39:00] <guzzlefry> yep, widget is unsetting that click event. 0.o
[13:39:18] <duch_kazatel> what does their code look like?
[13:39:52] <stlstude> brunoais , duch_kazatel was correct as i had to run to a meeting. but i do want to learn, hence why i enjoy this IRC :)
[13:42:32] <joshuaw> Can someone confirm that, in jQM 1.4.2, 'role="main"' is supposed to be used, it is in the docs in a bunch of places but my IDE is telling me that the 'role' attribute doesn't exist and I am not finding it in the code.
[13:42:52] <joshuaw> is it a typo in the docs and should have been 'data-role'?
[13:44:00] <duch_kazatel> where in the docs are you seeing it?
[13:44:10] <joshuaw> let me get the link
[13:44:30] <joshuaw> http://api.jquerymobile.com/listview/
[13:44:35] <joshuaw> go to the bottom
[13:44:49] <joshuaw> in line 17 of the example
[13:45:38] <duch_kazatel> http://www.w3.org/TR/role-attribute/
[13:46:12] <joshuaw> duch_kazatel: thanks
[13:46:24] <duch_kazatel> what IDE are you using?
[13:46:29] <joshuaw> eclipse
[13:46:37] <duch_kazatel> ah.  might be out of date
[13:46:44] <joshuaw> yeah, maybe
[13:46:55] <joshuaw> I am not on the latest version
[13:51:11] <zylophone> after doing a replaceWith, why are the changes being lost? http://jsfiddle.net/4JS85/2
[13:52:16] <duch_kazatel> zylophone http://jsfiddle.net/4JS85/3/
[13:52:48] <duch_kazatel> the changes never happen in the first place.
[13:54:24] <zylophone> duch_kazatel: interesting, why doesn't #foo .bar find the element, but .bar does?
[13:54:38] <duch_kazatel> because it's a fragment.  the outside of the fragment is #foo.
[13:54:44] <teamcoltra> okay I am being dumb again... http://jsfiddle.net/cz696/ I am trying to run the jQueryMobile swipe handler, and change the class of a div and then be able to swipe back
[13:54:51] <duch_kazatel> zylophone http://jsfiddle.net/4JS85/5/ this works.
[13:55:07] <teamcoltra> It only seems to go one way though
[13:55:36] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra looks like you're binding once, then destroying it an binding again.
[13:56:07] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra fyi you only need one $(function(){ in this case.
[13:56:43] <zylophone> duch_kazatel: why does the string have to be the $(html) version of it?
[13:57:19] <duch_kazatel> because you want a fragment, not a string.
[13:57:28] <duch_kazatel> basically, you're convoluting strings with DOM
[13:58:04] <duch_kazatel> and what the constructor function does.
[13:58:53] <zylophone> so if i want to parse html with jquery, i need the $(foo) version not the foo? does that then render foo useless?
[13:59:19] <duch_kazatel> kind of.
[14:00:03] <duch_kazatel> you could also do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/4JS85/6/
[14:00:13] <guzzlefry> uh, $('*:not(.star-rating, .dont-unbind)').unbind();
[14:00:16] <guzzlefry> Would that do it? :P
[14:00:37] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry .off()
[14:00:44] <zylophone> duch_kazatel: i see, thanks
[14:00:44] <guzzlefry> huh?
[14:00:47] <duch_kazatel> and if the framework you're using doesn't meet your needs, why are you using it.
[14:00:50] <shoky> Azrael_- http://jsbin.com/facepava/3/edit
[14:00:56] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry don't use .unbind(), use .off()
[14:00:57] <zylophone> duch_kazatel: talking to me?
[14:01:13] <duch_kazatel> zylophone nope.
[14:01:17] <zylophone> ok :)
[14:01:24] <guzzlefry> duch_kazatel: Part of the framework/application. But that's definitely what's killing my event handler, right?
[14:01:45] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry that could do it, sure.
[14:02:13] <guzzlefry> seems kind of...idiotic. I'll just add the dont-unbind class to my <a> though.
[14:02:39] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry any idea why it's doing that?
[14:03:19] <duch_kazatel> or, flipping that on its head, why are you working around your framework's limitations?
[14:04:17] <guzzlefry> No clue why it does that. And I'm working around it because I'm not fully aware of the limitations. The documentation is scarce at best.
[14:04:45] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel do I need to unbind? I just tried adding ".unbind()" to the handler function... and it does stop it from running again but doesn't allow the new one to take place http://jsfiddle.net/cz696/1/
[14:04:57] <teamcoltra> :) I also cleaned it up based on your suggestion
[14:05:08] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry sorry, phrasing poorly here: what problem are you trying to solve?
[14:05:50] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra what are you actually trying to do?
[14:06:00] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra are you trying to run 2 functions?
[14:06:11] <guzzlefry> I have a link that shows the friend lookup widget (part of PHPFox). The two useful buttons on that widget call $Core.init(), which in turn do that unbiding nonsense. I know how to work around it though.
[14:06:15] <guzzlefry> I think... :P
[14:06:19] <duch_kazatel> or are you trying to run one, then the other, teamcoltra?
[14:06:22] <teamcoltra> I want to swipe once, and have it change... and then swipe again and ahve it change back duch_kazatel
[14:07:01] <teamcoltra> But eventually have it open to a chain of events, like swipe to red, swipe to blue, swipe to green, then swipe again back to red.
[14:07:04] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra then what you have there will never work.  that binds both functions to run together.  you need to setup a handler that runs one function, then the other
[14:07:28] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra let me setup what i'm talking about.
[14:07:56] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra also - you can';t bind to things that don't yet exist :)
[14:08:42] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel I thought that might be part of the problem
[14:09:42] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra but we're going to do this a little smarter.
[14:12:43] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra http://jsfiddle.net/cz696/2/
[14:12:44] <Azrael_-> shoky: thanks
[14:13:13] <duch_kazatel> if you want to have a bunch of different ones, make an array with your functions and cycle through those instead.
[14:14:47] <teamcoltra> duch_kazatel Ahhh so I was on the right path with one of my solutions. I was trying to do something like $("#swipe").$('.rain').dothings buuut apparently that's not valid
[14:15:18] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:15:27] <duch_kazatel> $("#swipe").$('.rain') doesn't work anyway
[14:16:49] <teamcoltra> Yeah, thats' what I found. However, your solution is roughly the same idea but done with the right format. Have one single swipe area and then modify it based on it's other classes (indexOf)
[14:17:27] <guzzlefry> oh okay, they use a $Behavior namespace that you throw functions onto like $Behavior.bindHandlerForever = function() { console.log('yay');}; Which I guess gets called on $Core.init()
[14:17:53] <teamcoltra> I feel so much better now that I can finally read javascript and understand it... it makes it easier to start searching for solutions. Before it just looked like a a bunch of random stuff shoved together (like RegEx still looks to me). Now it's making sense.
[14:18:27] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry that makes much mor sense.
[14:19:37] <duch_kazatel> teamcoltra once you get the concept of how the jquery constructor works, and some other basics, you'll start understanding it even more.
[14:31:43] <brunoais> stlstude, :)
[14:32:00] <brunoais> then, can you answer my question? "where does it search in?"
[14:38:57] <bobbobbins> hey, I’m using jplayer, and it works fine in firefox, but in chrome when i try to attach .jPlayer() to a div, it gives me the error “TypeError: undefined is not a function {  }” It seems like its trying to attach jPlayer to the div before jplayer is loaded, but I have everything wrapped in $(document).ready() so I don’t see how that can be…any ideas?
[14:42:55] <duch_kazatel> bobbobbins try using jQuery instead of $ and see if that changes anything?
[14:44:00] <bobbobbins> duch_kazatel: well i wrapped $(document) with (function($){ }(jQuery)
[14:44:13] <bobbobbins> oops, (function($){ })(jQuery);
[14:48:11] <bobbobbins> no luck there
[14:55:33] <razrunelord> Hey guys, lets say I have a $.foo.close = function(event) { .. }; Can I listen to when close is called? when I do $.foo.close(function() { alert('closed'); }); it doesn't work
[14:55:37] <duch_kazatel> $.extend()
[14:55:55] <duch_kazatel> razrunelord that code re replacing .close(), not extending it.
[14:56:13] <duch_kazatel> razrunelord but that's pretty unusual - why are you doing htat?
[14:56:52] <razrunelord> duch_kazatel: close is an event defined in a popup modal's class. I want to listen to it and trigger other actions when close is called.
[14:57:29] <duch_kazatel> either modify it, extend it, or bind to the events manually.
[14:58:09] <duch_kazatel> (don't do the first two btw)
[14:59:51] <razrunelord> duch_kazatel: I should do $.foo.close.bind("click", function() {...});
[14:59:58] <duch_kazatel> razrunelord nope.
[15:00:08] <duch_kazatel> razrunelord could you fiddle up an example of what you're trying to do?
[15:00:11] <duch_kazatel> something minimal?
[15:00:38] <razrunelord> duch_kazatel: yeah, sec
[15:26:09] <Ownix> How can I have a code block run only if an element is in view ?
[15:26:25] <Ownix> if(user has not scrolled down the page){ // run this }
[15:26:32] <Ownix> Hmm... i suppose I could check for a hash
[15:26:33] <duch_kazatel> abstract it into a function, check if element is in view, run.
[15:26:40] <Ownix> That might be easier on second thought
[15:26:52] <duch_kazatel> if the hash corresponds, yep/
[15:27:24] <Ownix> If it exists at all. I have a success message that slides up after 3 seconds
[15:27:44] <Ownix> well if the user submits a new comment and I have scrolled down the page for them via a hash, I dont want that message to dissapear
[15:27:48] <Ownix> and move the page
[15:33:15] <Ownix> Crap. Appending the hash after comment creation is causing other issues with postbacks in my C# code. If the anchor is there it will keep trying to scroll down
[15:39:18] <doug65536> Ownix: use .on('scroll'
[15:39:48] <doug65536> Ownix: if you would prefer a plugin, there are several that do what you are asking
[15:41:02] <Ownix> doug65536: ill look into that, I think my problems are bigger right now thogh. The hash seems to work just fine. The success message only exists on the first postback after a new comment has been added.
[15:44:24] <pawelbx> how come jQuery doesn't give us any common data structures like lists, hash maps, etc?
[15:44:27] <pawelbx> it would be nice
[15:44:38] <doug65536> pawelbx: what? use javascript
[15:44:53] <doug65536> a list is an array, a "hash map" is an object
[15:44:59] <pawelbx> no no it's not
[15:47:51] <doug65536> pawelbx: what's not
[15:48:27] <duch_kazatel> pawelbx because jquery isn't a programming language.
[15:48:41] <duch_kazatel> if you want a "list", use an array.  if you want a "hash map", use a plain old object.
[15:48:43] <pawelbx> an object in JS is a special case of a hash map
[15:48:50] <duch_kazatel> sort of yeah.
[15:49:03] <pawelbx> see here for a detailed description: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/368280/javascript-hashmap-equivalent
[15:49:07] <doug65536> pawelbx: oh you know already. then why ask that
[15:50:11] <doug65536> pawelbx: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15518328/creating-js-object-with-object-createnull/21079232#21079232
[15:54:51] <doug65536> pawelbx: XY question anyway. you want non-string keys? you don't even mention that
[15:54:54] <pawelbx> doug65536: yes that's good to know, but like i said a js object is a special case of a hashMap. I just wanted to make the point that it would be nice to have a few more data structures like a linked hash map for example
[15:55:32] <doug65536> there's nothing special case. it's an associative array - hashing has nothing to do with it
[15:55:34] <m1chael> http://dpaste.com/1BAN14H/ # i need someone to explain to me what this line does: .call(this, $.Event('done'), {result: result});   ... and how can i tap in to this to trigger code after the event done is heard
[15:56:26] <doug65536> it's a property bag - with all implementations (that I know of) actually preserving key insertion order
[15:56:28] <duch_kazatel> m1chael that's not an event
[15:56:29] <shoky> please leave linked hash maps out of jquery, kthx
[15:56:53] <duch_kazatel> shoky++
[15:57:38] <pawelbx> doug65536: it only accepts strings as keys. how is that not a special case?
[15:59:20] <doug65536> pawelbx: it you REALLY want non-string keys - json encode them and use that as a key
[16:00:26] <doug65536> pawelbx: what type did you want to use as a key? you were hoping it had a C# Dictionary class? what for? it's builtin to the language in js
[16:01:29] <doug65536> numbers, booleans, strings can be keys. you wanted to use object references as keys?
[16:02:29] <pawelbx> doug65536:all those are converted to strings
[16:02:41] <doug65536> pawelbx: yes. why does that matter though
[16:03:26] <pawelbx> it doesn't, but creating a key for an object does matter
[16:03:49] <duch_kazatel> i'm lost about what we're fighting about.
[16:03:50] <doug65536> pawelbx: override ToString on the object to produce a unique key and it will work
[16:04:23] <doug65536> you won't get back the object reference though when you enumerate - you'll get the string
[16:05:55] <pawelbx> i don't really have a problem with the map in JS. i just want other objects like a linked hash map, tree map, etc
[16:07:23] <doug65536> pawelbx: ok, use O(log n) stuff. I'll keep using native js O(1) stuff though
[16:08:09] <doug65536> when an object gets big, most implementations switch to a map internally anyway
[16:09:35] <pawelbx> sometimes the order matters. the point is you want to retrieve things in O(1) and iterate in the order you inserted or whatever order you specified
[16:09:49] <doug65536> pawelbx: js preserves insertion order
[16:10:01] <pawelbx> not in an object
[16:10:10] <doug65536> yes it does
[16:10:37] <pawelbx> how
[16:11:34] <shoky> V8 doesn't always
[16:11:45] <shoky> iirc
[16:11:50] <doug65536> shoky: can you prove it?
[16:11:52] <pawelbx> it's not in the standard it does not preserve order
[16:12:10] <doug65536> pawelbx: prove it
[16:12:20] <pawelbx> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5525795/does-javascript-guarantee-object-property-order
[16:12:31] <doug65536> V8 makes a new hidden class whenever you set a property that doesn't exist
[16:12:52] <doug65536> { a:1, b:2 } is not the same class as { b:2, a:1 }
[16:13:08] <shoky> doug65536 when the key is a number or something
[16:13:37] <pawelbx> same class? what is a class in js?
[16:13:59] <shoky> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6140011/1098884
[16:14:06] <doug65536> pawelbx: you are asking implementation details, so my answer includes implementation details. google V8 hidden class
[16:16:01] <pawelbx> no. i'm not talking about implementation details. there is no guarantee period.
[16:26:36] <doug65536> pawelbx: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/QneLJ/1/

[16:30:01] <duch_kazatel> whatevs then.  dude needs to chill.
[16:30:32] <nhulea> hes the one claiming its a habit yeah I just wanted him to be the lead cause I am like I just dont know

[17:54:13] <ophi491> oh ok
[17:55:32] <ophi491> http://jsfiddle.net/FtmGr/
[17:55:51] <duch_kazatel> okay.  what's your question?
[17:56:58] <ophi491> I am trying to do a get request from a website's api but i cant execute the callback
[17:57:45] <ophi491> when i used success: and error: error would throw an undefined'
[17:57:57] <duch_kazatel> try doing something like this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/FtmGr/1/
[17:59:42] <ophi491> nope it still doesnt get called
[17:59:58] <duch_kazatel> open up your console - what does it say?
[18:00:01] <ophi491> in the response I have all of the information but it will only ever throw 'parsererror' in error:
[18:00:14] <ophi491> Object {readyState: 1, setRequestHeader: function, getAllResponseHeaders: function, getResponseHeader: function, overrideMimeType: function…}
[18:00:34] <duch_kazatel> does this API support JSONP?
[18:01:16] <ophi491> oh... I thought it did but probably not
[18:01:34] <ophi491> Is there anyway I can still do cross domain
[18:01:45] <duch_kazatel> if they support CORS, yes.
[18:01:51] <duch_kazatel> what API is it?
[18:02:04] <ophi491> I can show you the website - crypto exchange: https://www.mintpal.com/api
[18:03:07] <ophi491> i tried with cors but it keps saying Access-Control-Allow-Origin is not on the resource or something
[18:03:08] <Es0teric> has anyone here used twitter bootstrap's grid?
[18:03:21] <duch_kazatel> ophi491 right so you need to make a server-side call.
[18:03:39] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i go home.
[18:03:40] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[18:06:35] <joshuaw> I'm using jQuery Mobile 1.4.2.  I have a Grid of 3 Buttons in a Footer.  In jQM 1.3 they filled up the whole footer, but in 1.4 they stay normal sized.  If I pull the Grid out of the Footer, it behaves normally for a Grid.
[18:06:50] <joshuaw> Has anyone tried this?
[18:07:09] <joshuaw> is something broken with the Toolbar widget?
[19:11:32] <Sal> hi
[19:11:34] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/2fq5Q/4/
[19:11:52] <Sal> can someone tell me why the body margin-top doesn't change on button click?
[19:13:02] <Sal> hmmm, seems that the resize is not working
[19:29:02] <Es0teric> ok i need some help with my code here real quick... i am trying to dynamically add x elements in a new <div class="row">
[19:30:40] <Es0teric> anybody?
[19:30:41] <Es0teric> anybody here?
[19:33:33] <__joshua__> hi
[19:33:49] <Sal> Es0teric, append()
[19:34:07] <Es0teric> Sal i have code, sec...
[19:35:05] <Sal> $('.row').append(youtHtml);
[19:35:08] <Sal> thats it
[19:35:38] <Es0teric> Sal -> http://pastie.org/private/gqy9tdoikr0gdben7d2zrw
[19:35:51] <Es0teric> Sal i am iterating through objects...
[19:36:30] <__joshua__> whats e.data?
[19:36:47] <Sal> Es0teric, i do it in another way
[19:36:48] <__joshua__> and you only add an element for every 4 e.datas?
[19:36:54] <Sal> prepare all your htmlk in a string
[19:36:57] <__joshua__> no
[19:37:01] <DarkNova> sal, do you know where i can get DS hosting or Colo for ~$20/m
[19:37:04] <__joshua__> dont' be silly
[19:37:10] <Sal> and then simply: $('.row').append(yourHtml);
[19:37:17] <__joshua__> hes doing it fine
[19:37:35] <__joshua__> its just formatted poorly
[19:37:55] <Es0teric> __joshua__ i want to create a <div class="row"> for every 4 e.datas
[19:38:14] <__joshua__> and what is e.data?
[19:38:17] <Sal> Es0teric, don0t add 1 element ata time, it will require more time to build
[19:38:28] <__joshua__> ba, 1ms vs 1.5 ms
[19:38:29] <Es0teric> __joshua__ e.data is objects pulled from a api in json format
[19:38:40] <Sal> Es0teric, ok?
[19:38:42] <__joshua__> so its an array of objects?
[19:38:45] <Sal> did you get it?
[19:38:48] <Sal> i have to leave
[19:38:59] <Es0teric> Sal what you said i dont get it..
[19:39:17] <__joshua__> sorry, ignore Sal.  the only problem is with your iteration
[19:39:43] <__joshua__> so its an array of objects?
[19:39:48] <Es0teric> __joshua__ yeah
[19:39:57] <Es0teric> that $.each needs to stay there though
[19:40:56] <Sal> for me you're doing to many appends
[19:41:26] <Sal> i would do only 1 append()
[19:41:44] <Sal> anyway, night
[19:42:00] <__joshua__> looks ok to me http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/
[19:44:07] <__joshua__> that link is for your, btw, Es0teric:
[19:44:22] <Es0teric> __joshua__ yeah but thats what i wrote already lol
[19:44:54] <__joshua__> yeah.  so what is your question?
[19:45:43] <Es0teric> __joshua__ my question is how do i create a new row for every 4 items?
[19:46:25] <__joshua__> oh, you mean group together every 4 things, not draw every 4th?
[19:46:34] <Es0teric> __joshua__ yeah
[19:46:38] <__joshua__> ah, one moment
[19:54:28] <Es0teric> alright __joshua__
[19:56:27] <__joshua__> sorry got distracted
[19:56:27] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/1/
[19:57:07] <CrispyClean> I have a quick little question here>>> http://bpaste.net/show/SvQbCGJGNDU4GUKIepci/
[19:57:41] <Es0teric> __joshua__ would that create a new div in #images with the class .row?
[19:58:11] <__joshua__> for every forth object
[19:58:33] <Es0teric> __joshua__ ah ok let me test it
[19:58:47] <__joshua__> you can inspect the structure on the jsfiddle
[20:01:11] <Es0teric> __joshua__ that is so awesome... it actually worked, thanks man!
[20:01:18] <BillCriswell> CrispyClean: releaseDescription.find('h1')
[20:01:20] <__joshua__> no prob
[20:01:26] <Es0teric> __joshua__ as an added bonus what if i want to remove a div that matches a specific caption?
[20:01:45] <CrispyClean> thx BillCriswell !!
[20:02:16] <__joshua__> $('#images').find(':contains(mycaption')').remove();
[20:02:45] <joshuaw> I'm using jQuery Mobile 1.4.2.  I have a Grid of 3 Buttons in a Footer.  In jQM 1.3 they filled up the whole footer, but in 1.4 they stay normal sized.  If I pull the Grid out of the Footer, it behaves normally for a Grid. Has anyone tried putting a Grid in a Toolbar in 1.4?
[20:03:04] <Es0teric> __joshua__ would contains() match whatever word i add in?
[20:03:05] <BillCriswell> CrispyClean: No problem.
[20:03:46] <__joshua__> should.  http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[20:08:32] <Es0teric> __joshua__ it seems that it removes a whole row rather than targeting just the div its in
[20:15:27] <__joshua__>  $('#images').find('.row> div:contains(mycaption')').remove();
[20:17:09] <Es0teric> __joshua__ yeah i also did something like... $('#images').find(":contains('my caption')")[1].remove();
[20:17:30] <Es0teric> __joshua__ but now theres a image missing in the first row...
[20:17:47] <__joshua__> i wouldn't do it that way
[20:18:14] <Es0teric> i would have to filter it out during the $.each()
[20:18:56] <Es0teric> __joshua__ now does .remove() work only with DOM elements? or can i use it to remove objects?
[20:19:12] <__joshua__> dom only
[20:19:20] <Es0teric> i mean i figured i can do something like if(object.caption == "mycaption") { $(this).remove() }
[20:19:24] <__joshua__> you need to splice out things from an array
[20:20:18] <Es0teric> __joshua__ but then how do i splice it out?
[20:22:00] <__joshua__> right, well firstly, i would remove from the array, then redraw the whole thing each time (easier to keep the array and dom in sync).  But first, how many images will you have, approximately
[20:23:08] <Es0teric> __joshua__ idk it depends on how much the api spits out
[20:23:11] <Es0teric> so far i see 19
[20:23:35] <__joshua__> 1000s or dozens?
[20:24:20] <Es0teric> __joshua__ well it would be up to 19 at a time i suppose
[20:24:31] <Es0teric> because the results are paged
[20:24:39] <__joshua__> cool, let me make a fiddle
[20:30:42] <tw2113> Velveeta, question for you
[20:31:17] <tw2113> or danheberden either of you works
[20:32:22] <Es0teric> whats up tw2113
[20:32:25] <Es0teric> long time man
[20:32:34] <tw2113> show up more :P
[20:32:47] <Es0teric> i try man, i've been real busy with a lot of stuff lol
[20:33:23] <__joshua__> try this http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/2/
[20:33:37] <__joshua__> if you don't like the full render we can be smarter about it
[20:33:57] <tw2113> ugh, another romp into windows
[20:34:20] <tw2113> at least it didn't have updates to apply again
[20:35:59] <Es0teric> __joshua__ i'll try it, thanks man
[20:37:19] <joshuaw> I'm using jQuery Mobile 1.4.2.  I have a Grid of 3 Buttons in a Footer.  In jQM 1.3 they filled up the whole footer, but in 1.4 they stay normal sized.  If I pull the Grid out of the Footer, it behaves normally for a Grid. Has anyone tried putting a Grid in a Toolbar in 1.4?
[20:43:58] <ophi491> hi can anyone explain to me how to take in and print to console the jsonp data i receive from an http get request - http://jsfiddle.net/su3VR/
[20:46:12] <ophi491> the api's standard responses are json
[20:47:27] <Es0teric> ok so __joshua__ would the code you wrote work with any phrase? or does it have to be one letter?
[20:48:10] <joshuaw> ophi491: have you tried console.log instead?
[20:48:27] <__joshua__> anything
[20:49:19] <joshuaw> ophi491: also you may want to update the ajax api and use 'done' instead of success, then after 'done' add a 'fail' with another console.log to check if things are breaking
[20:53:36] <Es0teric> __joshua__ ok so i ran the code and it doesnt remove the object
[20:56:31] <__joshua__> after 3 seconds?
[20:56:37] <doug65536> ophi491: this one is at least not a syntax error http://jsfiddle.net/su3VR/1/
[20:57:00] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/2/  you can see 'c' for the first 3 seconds, then it is gone
[20:57:04] <doug65536> ophi491: console says it can't resolve your fake url
[20:57:47] <Es0teric> __joshua__ it says e.data.forEach is not a function
[20:58:02] <__joshua__> ah, you are on a old browser.  one moment
[20:58:41] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/3/
[21:01:38] <Es0teric> __joshua__ i am using the new firefox
[21:02:02] <ophi491> doug65536: thank you. it gets to 'failed'. The console tells me Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : which i know is because i am getting jsonp back
[21:02:19] <__joshua__> oh, sounds like e.data not an array?
[21:02:43] <ophi491> I mean json*
[21:04:19] <Es0teric> __joshua__ it seems like it
[21:06:18] <Es0teric> __joshua__ actually no e.data is an array, i just did console.log on it
[21:06:37] <__joshua__> so before you use e.data, do a if(Array.isArray(e.data));
[21:07:08] <__joshua__> its probably an array by the time you console log it (im guessing it is an asynchronous source?)
[21:07:25] <Es0teric> __joshua__ yeah it is
[21:13:11] <Es0teric> __joshua__ so then why would it say that foreach is not a function?
[21:14:13] <__joshua__> because data is not an array, probably
[21:15:26] <Es0teric> __joshua__ but it becomes an array asynchronously
[21:15:28] <Es0teric> right?
[21:16:11] <__joshua__> probably.  im having to guess without seeing the rest
[21:16:21] <__joshua__> you should only call render etc after its pulled the data
[21:17:00] <Velveeta> tw2113: i never saw you ask a question
[21:17:12] <tw2113> i was waiting for a response that you were here first :P
[21:17:27] <tw2113> anyways?isn't the nicest thing to hear in here "see fiddle linked" ? :D
[21:17:31] <Velveeta> don't look for help from specific people, just throw your question out.. you might have had an answer 45 minutes ago :)
[21:17:42] <abishek> could someone advice me on how to fix this http://jsbin.com/gahuv/2/edit
[21:17:43] <tw2113> it wasn't a help question though
[21:17:46] <ophi491> If a website only responds with json encoded arrays can you still request jsonp?
[21:17:48] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha
[21:18:01] <Velveeta> yes, it's always nice when people ask their question and have a fiddle ready to go right off the bat ;)
[21:18:24] <tw2113> almost as nice as "see check enclosed"
[21:18:26] <Velveeta> ophi491: you can request it, sure.. that doesn't mean they'll respect it
[21:18:52] <Velveeta> tw2113: you know what i hate those? "not a check".. especially on some clown-looking check
[21:19:03] <tw2113> i got a check earlier from the IRS
[21:19:07] <tw2113> i overpaid by $5
[21:19:09] <Velveeta> you're like "oh really? this thing practically drawn in crayon, made out for a bazillion dollars, isn't a real check?"
[21:19:17] <ophi491> Velveeta I get all the data back in the response header I just dont know how to use it... the console says Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[21:19:25] <Es0teric> __joshua__ i did something like if($.isArray(e.data)) { render(); } but its not rendering
[21:19:29] <ophi491> For one of their files
[21:19:44] <Velveeta> ophi491: without seeing the response itself, that's not a helpful error
[21:20:18] <__joshua__> its probably a scoping issue.  is there an 'e'  that is global?
[21:20:29] <Velveeta> tw2113: i've only ever had to pay at taxtime once... and it was $6... and i was scraping and scrounging trying to come up with one last deduction to zero that out, to no avail..... it was the hardest $6 i ever spent :D
[21:20:46] <Es0teric> __joshua__ no thats not global
[21:21:09] <tw2113> yeah, i'm playing a tiny violin in my head for you over that, after this year's season
[21:21:21] <Es0teric> __joshua__ thats the param in the getJSON()
[21:21:37] <Velveeta> oh don't get me wrong.. i pay... i just have my withholding at 0, and check the box to withhold at the higher single rate
[21:21:46] <Velveeta> so i lose a shit-ton throughout the year
[21:21:56] <Velveeta> i've just never had to pay *extra* come tax-time, except that one year
[21:22:39] <ophi491> Velveeta here is the code someone helped me fix before - http://jsfiddle.net/tHhhy/
[21:23:19] <Velveeta> ophi491: that doesn't help me with the error you're getting.. i would need to see the *response* that site is sending back, since that's what's throwing your error
[21:23:43] <abishek> could someone advice me on what am i doing wrong here http://jsbin.com/gahuv/2/edit
[21:24:30] <__joshua__> Es0teric: right, but render is expecting a global.  you should instead pass 'e' to render
[21:24:41] <Velveeta> abishek: not without knowing what you're expected result is vs actual result
[21:25:34] <ophi491> Velveeta the response is a jsonp array I think I added it - http://jsfiddle.net/tHhhy/1/
[21:25:51] <ophi491> But I think the problem is just that i am not handling the datatype properly
[21:25:59] <Es0teric> __joshua__ thats not displaying anything yet
[21:26:17] <__joshua__> ok
[21:26:27] <__joshua__> let me try again
[21:26:55] <abishek> Velveeta, I have 2 div's which I want it to work like a content scroller, so clicking on next should animate and show the next div. Right now the div is showing one below the other. How can i make it show on the same line and animate correctly
[21:26:55] <Velveeta> ophi491: there's no market property in that object... it's also not an array you're getting back, it's an object with a 'data' property that happens to be an array
[21:28:26] <Velveeta> abishek: you have those items declared as width: 100%, and floated left... they're gonna automatically wrap with those kinds of properties
[21:28:28] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/4/
[21:28:50] <ophi491> Velveeta: thank you. Yes the market is wrong I just put that in to see if 'failed' was still getting called
[21:29:06] <ophi491> Do I have to define a name for the object or is that what the callback is used for
[21:29:35] <Velveeta> ophi491: the parameter you're receiving (data) should be the object you're getting back
[21:29:55] <Velveeta> so data.status, data.count, and data.data would be valid references in that object
[21:31:49] <Es0teric> __joshua__ e returns undefined when put in as a parameter for render = function(){}; but when the param is removed it renders the stuff
[21:31:54] <ophi491> Velveeta: thank you. even when I change it to data.status it still fails and throws Unexpected token : - from summary.json
[21:32:20] <abishek> Velveeta, so how should I fix it?
[21:32:57] <__joshua__> did my fiddle work for you?
[21:33:07] <Velveeta> abishek: not sure off the top of my head, it's almost midnight here and my brain is fried for the day, but that's where i would start with the debugging
[21:33:29] <Es0teric> __joshua__ no
[21:33:31] <Es0teric> it did not
[21:33:32] <Es0teric> >.>
[21:33:58] <__joshua__> seriously? http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/4/ works fine for me
[21:34:47] <ophi491> abishek: add position:fixed; to the .items div{} class
[21:35:08] <Velveeta> ophi491: looks like it's badly formed json
[21:35:47] <Velveeta> although a json validator is showing it as valid
[21:36:38] <Es0teric> __joshua__ its not working...
[21:37:05] <__joshua__> define working
[21:37:23] <__joshua__> are you not seeing a bunch of letter and dead img's on the output?
[21:37:41] <Velveeta> ophi491: if i wrap that response in an array, and take index 0, it processes it just fine.. but not as an object literal
[21:37:54] <Es0teric> __joshua__ no i am not seeing dead imgs and not a bunch of letters either... everything displays fine it just doesnt remove the one object with the caption that i want to remoe
[21:38:12] <__joshua__> yeah, i removed the remove code.
[21:38:21] <__joshua__> let me add it again, this time with a controller middle man
[21:38:27] <ophi491> Velveeta: so it will display the entire string?
[21:38:53] <ophi491> Velveeta: do you think it is just a problem with requesting jsonp or something?
[21:39:25] <Velveeta> ophi491: this will probably explain it better: http://pastebin.com/D4XUVgZy
[21:39:38] <Velveeta> i don't think it has anything to do with jsonp
[21:41:17] <__joshua__> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/5/
[21:41:33] <__joshua__> after 1 second it will render.  3 seconds later it will remove a div
[21:41:40] <ophi491> Velveeta: that is strange
[21:41:51] <Velveeta> yep
[21:42:20] <ophi491> Can I see the code to wrap the response?
[21:43:15] <Velveeta> there is no code to wrap the response, that would have to be done at their end.. i tested that method to see if chrome would parse it properly, and it did
[21:45:39] <Velveeta> ok, i'm off to bed, adios errrrbody
[21:45:45] <__joshua__> g'night
[21:46:41] <ophi491> Velveeta: thank you good night
[21:47:40] <ophi491> if anyone else thinks they can help me from here I appreciate it - http://jsfiddle.net/tHhhy/1/
[21:47:53] <Es0teric> __joshua__ still
[21:47:59] <Es0teric> i counted 30 secs and nothing renders
[21:48:08] <__joshua__> and what error are you getting?
[21:48:19] <Es0teric> __joshua__ no errors... its just not calling render()
[21:48:31] <__joshua__> wtf.  let me try another browser
[21:48:43] <__joshua__> also, can someone else just see if http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/5/ runs?
[21:49:28] <__joshua__> works in ff, chromium, chrome
[21:49:45] <ophi491> i see letters and image placers
[21:49:52] <__joshua__> yup, that means it works
[21:50:06] <__joshua__> 1 second in it renders, 3 seconds later it removes 'c'
[21:50:26] <ophi491> yes
[21:50:38] <Es0teric> __joshua__ yeah it works on the fiddle but not for me
[21:50:54] <__joshua__> oh, you mean your code, which ive never seen, doesn't work?
[21:51:00] <Es0teric> __joshua__ yeah
[21:51:07] <Es0teric> let me show you real quick
[21:51:11] <__joshua__> ah.  well you have probably made a mistake
[21:51:40] <__joshua__> cool Es0teric, but go quick: my work finished in 9 minutes
[21:52:48] <Es0teric> __joshua__ -> http://pastie.org/private/0pnb70fxlqgqxqwb23miw
[21:53:34] <__joshua__> i see the problem
[21:53:53] <Es0teric> __joshua__ whats the problem?
[21:54:16] <__joshua__> you should swap you async function for my fake_async
[21:54:31] <__joshua__> your ajax callback should be 'controller'
[21:54:47] <Es0teric> __joshua__ wait what?
[21:55:46] <__joshua__> this code wont run in the fiddle, but
[21:55:46] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/6/
[21:56:10] <__joshua__> also, there is the problem of order of declaration
[21:56:18] <__joshua__> to the ajax at the bottom of the file
[21:56:22] <__joshua__> do*
[21:56:36] <Es0teric> what do you mean __joshua__
[21:57:10] <__joshua__> http://jsfiddle.net/2d4nT/7/
[21:57:20] <__joshua__> just replace 'some_url' with the api url
[21:59:15] <Es0teric> ah i see ok __joshua__
[21:59:16] <Es0teric> thanks
[21:59:17] <Es0teric> let me try this
[22:03:10] <Es0teric> __joshua__ now its saying value.images is undefined
[22:04:16] <__joshua__> well I got to go....
[22:04:37] <__joshua__> sound like the structure of the response might be different than what we were expecting
[22:04:50] <__joshua__> but im around again in 15 hours if you need help
[22:04:52] <doug65536> ophi491: why jsonp? just go through a json proxy
[22:04:57] <Es0teric> __joshua__ alright, thanks
[22:05:27] <ophi491> doug65536: can you explain? i have been trying to get this forever
[22:08:23] <doug65536> ophi491: I forget the name... but there are sites that will do an ajax request on your behalf and allow cross domain requests
[22:11:06] <doug65536> ophi491: they usually block cookies though. is that ok?
[22:11:55] <ophi491> doug65536: i think that would be fine it would just be a lot easier if jsonp would work
[22:12:05] <ophi491> I dont understand why it wont
[22:15:12] <doug65536> ophi491: can you give me the real server address in PM?
[22:15:23] <shoky> ophi491 jsonp only works if the server supports it. their server doesn't support it
[22:15:27] <shoky> same goes for CORS
[22:16:01] <ophi491> doug65536: this was the code to mintpal - http://jsfiddle.net/tHhhy/1/
[22:16:13] <ophi491> shoky: really? is there anyway to do cross-domain calls?
[22:16:47] <ophi491> shoky: or even use the data in the response header and reformat it?
[22:16:59] <shoky> yes. make an ajax request to your own server, have the server backend make the http request to the cross-domain server and respond with that result to the ajax request
[22:17:22] <shoky> i.e. a serverside proxy
[22:18:27] <doug65536> ophi491: without jsonp, through a proxy http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/tHhhy/2/
[22:18:46] <doug65536> ophi491: use jsonp if it works, but that hack might come in handy sometime
[22:19:15] <shoky> but just know that these proxies are usually not robust services, at least not until you pay
[22:19:26] <shoky> ophi491 ^
[22:20:28] <ophi491> doug65536: thank you
[22:21:26] <shoky> the fiddle's working for you?
[22:22:07] <ophi491> I just tried it, i am still getting a failed
[22:22:09] <ophi491> but it should work
[22:22:14] <shoky> wrong use of $.get
[22:22:39] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/tHhhy/3/
[22:24:59] <ophi491> wow thank you
[22:26:36] <ophi491> in the future can I just have a server pointed to any domain
[22:27:11] <Es0teric> i have a question -- if i have multiple images but i want to toggle them in a modal, would it be best to create a modal for each image (to view a larger version) or can i just make one modal and interchange each image that is clicked?
[22:27:43] <doug65536> ophi491: this works http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/tHhhy/6/
[22:28:11] <doug65536> ophi491: that data you pasted in misled me into thinking it worked :)
[22:28:18] <doug65536> in the top left
[22:29:02] <Es0teric> can anyone answer my question?
[22:30:43] <doug65536> Es0teric: it is much easier to change one img
[22:30:52] <Es0teric> doug65536 so how would i accomplish that?
[22:31:23] <doug65536> $('#someimage').attr('src', imgUrl)
[22:31:44] <Es0teric> doug65536 are you familiar with twitter bootstrap's modal?
[22:31:51] <doug65536> imgUrl is a string that has the url of the image in it
[22:32:14] <doug65536> Es0teric: yes
[22:33:02] <Es0teric> doug65536 how would i accomplish that using the twitter bootstrap modal?
[22:33:23] <ophi491> doug65536: yeah sorry i forgot to change that. so that code is sending a json request and converting it to a string?
[22:33:56] <doug65536> ophi491: the 'data' parameter in .done's callback is an object. I stringify it to print debug output onto the page: the object text
[22:34:56] <doug65536> ophi491: that's just a test hack to test the data parameter. remove that and just use the data parameter there
[22:35:29] <ophi491> Es0teric: here is someone's fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vLSWH/1/
[22:35:48] <doug65536> ophi491: I'm saying, in that .done callback, the json is already decoded and the 'data' parameter there is an object
[22:36:44] <ophi491> doug65536: oh I understand
[22:37:07] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[22:37:12] <Starcraftmazter> im appending an element to the dom
[22:37:16] <Starcraftmazter> positioned absolutely
[22:37:19] <Starcraftmazter> how can i made it slide down?
[22:37:26] <Starcraftmazter> from the top of the screen?
[22:37:57] <ophi491> doug65536: but there is no way to use the header response I get when requesting jsonp? because the data is there isnt it
[22:40:14] <abishek> ophi491, you suggested i use position fixed for an issue I was facing with http://jsbin.com/gahuv/4/edit. Do you have an alternative suggestion other than position fixed as changing it to position fixed affects a lot of other elements that are below the divs
[22:42:52] <doug65536> ophi491: no, look at the data, there are 3 properties on 'data': status, count, data
[22:43:09] <doug65536> data is an array of objects
[22:43:43] <Starcraftmazter> how do you make something slideDown from the very top
[22:44:02] <doug65536> Starcraftmazter: .animate is easy way
[22:44:30] <doug65536> make top negative initially, then .animate top onto the screen
[22:46:36] <foopsie> Hey guys, is anyone awake?
[22:50:07] <doug65536> Starcraftmazter: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4SjHA/
[22:50:45] <ophi491> abishek: what about this - http://jsbin.com/lerapivu/1/edit
[22:52:36] <doug65536> foopsie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_rotation
[22:53:10] <ophi491> doug65536: oh alright. in the future i could just have a server and point it at the domain right? to not go through a third party
[22:53:30] <doug65536> ophi491: sure, just proxy it right through your own server -
[22:53:46] <doug65536> add an ajax request your page can do - that asks the server to fetch some json and return it
[22:54:01] <doug65536> asks your server*
[22:54:20] <foopsie> Is it possible to simply chain a fadeIn function followed by a then function, without using promise() before then()? I can't seem to get it working, but works fine if I add in promise() before then()
[22:54:41] <doug65536> foopsie: use a callback
[22:54:55] <foopsie> I am trying to avoid the chain of doom
[22:54:57] <ophi491> can a server be anything? like since the data is small enough could i have a service running on my desktop that is always connected
[22:55:17] <doug65536> ophi491: you could
[22:56:08] <foopsie> doug65536: i am trying to do about 4 animations in a row, and it is looks very unclean, is callback the only way or can i do it differently?
[22:56:21] <doug65536> ophi491: there are free cors proxy implementations. it is almost trivial to make one that is restricted to your needs to prevent abuse
[22:56:53] <ophi491> doug65536: okay
[22:57:03] <doug65536> foopsie: use .promise
[22:57:10] <doug65536> foopsie: it works with that?
[22:57:38] <foopsie> it works with promise() but I am still ending up with a chain. I've not really used it before so I don't think I am doing it right
[22:58:00] <foopsie> hm, no really should be never
[22:58:31] <doug65536> foopsie: show fiddle please
[22:58:56] <doug65536> foopsie: you are saying you want to be able to loop?
[23:00:14] <foopsie> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/mfRHM/
[23:00:46] <foopsie> there must be a better way to do this, no?
[23:02:20] <ophi491> can you just use recursion and pass the name of the class as a paramater
[23:02:46] <doug65536> foopsie: yes
[23:02:50] <tudda> Having trouble with a progress indicator. it works, but when i attach it to the global ajaxStart / ajaxStop handlers, I am getting some strange behavior that doesn't match the documentation. : http://pastebin.com/Hj8rrL2z
[23:05:16] <tudda> Nevermind, I added async:false to my ajax call during some previous testing and that's the root cause of this.  Thanks anyway :)
[23:07:37] <foopsie> doug65536: my example leads into pyramid of doom after a few animations
[23:19:01] <doug65536> foopsie: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/mfRHM/1/
[23:19:42] <doug65536> foopsie: small bugfix http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/mfRHM/2/
[23:21:02] <doug65536> foopsie: it's basically a "generator" - the "recurse" function is a closure that captures "i", each callback uses the incremented i for the next callback
[23:23:36] <doug65536> foopsie: improved: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/mfRHM/3/  now takes a callback that is called when the whole sequential fade is done
[23:24:09] <foopsie> doug65536: it is a nice example to help me think more abstractly
[23:25:01] <foopsie> doug65536: however, what if it were not just adjusting fadeIn(), what if I have a chain of promises and the third would be a fadeOut, seventh would change the background colour and so forth, would you handle it differently or just pass objects?
[23:25:24] <doug65536> foopsie: where I am passing an array of selectors, extend that to objects, sure
[23:26:25] <foopsie> doug65536: OK, so is this the only way I can avoid the pyramid problem, you think
[23:26:43] <doug65536> foopsie: not the only way but I think the simplest way
[23:27:46] <ophi491> foopsie: you can try to use deferred object
[23:28:12] <brunoais> foopsie, if you want an alternative that does not use js to animate just ask me. Sounds an interesting problem
[23:28:26] <foopsie> ophi491: could you point me to the appropriate page?
[23:29:00] <doug65536> ophi491: his original code was using promise() which is deferred
[23:30:10] <doug65536> a promise is a deferred that is not allowed to resolve it
[23:30:24] <foopsie> ah that was already a requirement then
[23:31:22] <doug65536> foopsie: no no, .promise() is ok
[23:31:43] <ophi491> will this shorten it - http://blog.mediumequalsmessage.com/promise-deferred-objects-in-javascript-pt2-practical-use
[23:32:50] <doug65536> it's a 6 line function in my fiddle :P
[23:33:25] <foopsie> please correct me if I am wrong as I am very new to jquery, but it's not possible to assign an animation to a variable without firing it?
[23:34:15] <doug65536> foopsie: you can make that happen if you need that
[23:34:37] <foopsie> it's an alternative method that may work, the link above uses something similar
[23:34:55] <foopsie> how would i go about that?
[23:35:07] <foopsie> wrap inside a function?
[23:35:21] <doug65536> foopsie: yes
[23:35:36] <Es0teric> i have a question... i am doing this: $('.img-container').on('click', function(e) { console.log($(this)) }); but its not logging anything... what could the the source of that problem?
[23:36:17] <doug65536> Es0teric: jquery not loaded, nothing with class img-container
[23:36:37] <Es0teric> doug65536 jquery is loaded...
[23:36:39] <doug65536> Es0teric: running the code before the element with img-container exists
[23:37:08] <Es0teric> doug65536 is there any param in $.ajax() that will allow me to run code after ajax is completely loaded?
[23:37:10] <doug65536> Es0teric: by not waiting for DOM ready
[23:37:52] <Es0teric> isnt there a "after" param in $.ajax() ?
[23:38:01] <doug65536> Es0teric: I doubt you need $.ajax. use the helpers like $.get or $.post, pass the url as the first parameter, null second parameter, optional datatype 3rd parameter, then chain to .done and .fail
[23:38:36] <Es0teric> doug65536 so then it would be $.ajax({}).done(); ?
[23:38:43] <doug65536> $.get(url, null, 'json').done(function() { console.log("yay!"); }).fail(function() { console.log("bad"); })
[23:39:22] <doug65536> or...   .done(function(data) { ... })
[23:39:51] <doug65536> Es0teric: yes
[23:40:14] <doug65536> $.get returns a deferred
[23:40:26] <Es0teric> doug65536 perfect
[23:40:39] <doug65536> so does $.ajax etc
[23:40:58] <doug65536> gotta go though
[23:41:18] <doug65536> hope that helps ophi491 and foopsie
[23:41:50] <foopsie> doug65536: you helped a bunch thanks
[23:42:38] <ophi491> doug65536: thank you
