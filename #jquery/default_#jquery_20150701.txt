[00:06:45] <lablayers> bePolite: thanks again, I re-optimized the code to be $('foo').siblings('p:first-of-type').text(); so that it always selects the first <p> tag instead of the first in a series of nested tags
[00:07:00] <Koopz> never mind... got rid off the problem...

[00:51:57] <goldfinger> If you scroll downa bit
[00:52:05] <goldfinger> you will see three images
[00:52:18] <goldfinger> Inflation, diversification, crisis
[00:52:29] <goldfinger> how to see which files are causingthe hover effect?
[00:52:35] <goldfinger> can someone see that ?
[01:13:19] <goldfinger> is anyone here like?
[01:13:30] <arthurvr> hey goldfinger
[01:13:31] <arthurvr> what’s up?
[01:22:53] <Bjerre> hello everyone
[01:23:04] <arthurvr> yo Bjerre
[01:23:07] <arthurvr> sup
[01:25:16] <Bjerre> my SPA is acting really weird to the change language js. It works on changing to a new "scene", but I have to click on the toggle button twice to change the language again. http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/y7ovtavp/
[01:25:24] <Bjerre> perhaps I should use something else then toggle?
[01:27:08] <Bjerre> My guess would be that the button is not toggled when joining the new scene but the language is set to as it would be
[01:27:18] <Bjerre> so I have to click twice
[01:34:48] <rfc19> Hi, I'm trying to disable all menu items <ul id="items"> if an element (<li>) is clicked and until the page has loaded. I want to prevent users from hitting the menu multiple times and causing issues. How can I best achieve this?
[01:41:43] <Cork> rfc19: you mean disable
[01:41:52] <Cork> * all meny items inside that ul?
[01:41:59] <Cork> *menu*
[01:42:41] <Cork> rfc19: if yes, how to do it would depend on how the menu is structured
[01:42:45] <Cork> could you create a jsfiddle?
[02:07:46] <veek> is there a way to quickly identify for sure if a page uses jquery.. will searching for script/jquery suffice
[02:09:09] <davesidious> Hey folks - does anyone know a way to make a specific bootstrap column slide off the page (and, ideally, back again)?
[02:09:14] <Kartagis> veek: open up the console and start typing jQ... if you get jQuery, the page has it
[02:10:46] <veek> Kartagis, yep did that.. worried if he could be loading it some other way.. basically i'm scraping a web-page (http://xdguo.taobao.com/category-499399872.htm) in python and i'm using webkit and it's not working
[02:11:20] <veek> the actual juciy bits aren't there in the rawhtml after webkit has run
[02:18:19] <DreamStiffler> ANJ7: you still around?
[02:20:03] <rfc19> Cork: sorry, I got disconnected.. yes all items are in that UL
[02:20:05] <DreamStiffler> ANJ7: basically i suck balls. i have spent few hours on this. But wasnt sure how to apply this to my current sandbox. Ive cut down all my scripts to use jqueries
[02:20:18] <DreamStiffler> http://jsfiddle.net/531La38t/7/ my code need real help
[02:20:32] <rfc19> its just a bunch of li elements in a ul
[02:20:41] <DreamStiffler> Cork: u around mate?
[02:29:34] <DreamStiffler> anybody
[02:53:41] <dimi1947> how I can set the value on input type number...I tried val() but it does not work....
[02:57:38] <kokut> Hello, how can i get the real distance to the top of the document from the top of an element?
[02:58:28] <kokut> this http://jsfiddle.net/vmdreq80/ ain't workin :\
[03:01:00] <Cork> dimi1947: what do you mean value of type number?
[03:01:17] <Cork> you want to change the type of the input to <input type="number">?
[03:02:12] <Cork> kokut: offset().top is the offset to the top of the viewport
[03:02:29] <Cork> meaning if the element is above the viewport you will have a negative value
[03:03:08] <alluringme> Hi, is there a way I can track Google ads via Jquery? I ask this as I was reading Google policies and I have a strange feeling it is not allowed.
[03:03:12] <alluringme> Any ideas?
[03:03:33] <Cork> alluringme: depends on what you mean by track
[03:04:12] <Cork> if you mean track what url is used, then sure
[03:04:12] <Cork> if you mean actually grabbing something that isn't in the page
[03:04:12] <Cork> then nope
[03:05:24] <alluringme> Cork: Let me try to explain. When a user clicks on the ad, he get a few points. Those points will give rewards to users. Much like a PTC.
[03:05:44] <Cork> that is tracked server side
[03:05:46] <Cork> not in the clinet
[03:05:48] <Cork> *client
[03:06:15] <alluringme> Okay. So I must do it on PHP end then.
[03:06:23] <Cork> no
[03:06:28] <Cork> you must do it on googles servers
[03:06:36] <Cork> aka. you don't have access to it
[03:06:45] <alluringme> Oh, lol okay.
[03:07:18] <alluringme> I mean I want to reward users when they click; I was thinking about implementing a 60 second timer and giving them a code to enter. Then they get the points.
[03:07:40] <alluringme> I was just not sure if this is permissible.
[03:08:33] <rfc19> Hey Cork, sorry about before. How can I block at all LI elements in a UL?
[03:09:05] <Cork> rfc19: like i said, you need to share the structure of the menu
[03:09:09] <alluringme> Thanks Cork.
[03:10:24] <rfc19> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/7mjfrscp/
[03:10:47] <Cork> ok, so you have to just wait with attaching the click handlers
[03:14:44] <rfc19> Cork: that's what i'd like.. but can you give me an example or reference?
[03:15:06] <kokut> Cork: i dont understand why jQuery('element_2').attr('style', jQuery('element_1').offset().top); doesn't put element_1 and element_2 at the same distance to the top of the document if element_2 is in position:absolute mode
[03:17:24] <DreamStiffler> hey rfc19 ince cork is helping you out. why dont you help me out
[03:17:32] <DreamStiffler> http://jsfiddle.net/531La38t/7/
[03:17:55] <DreamStiffler> im trying to set those in group. each 2 results in 1 div
[03:20:17] <rfc19> DreamStiffler: there's a reason why I'm asking for help :D I'm a JQuery freshy.
[03:23:30] <Cork> rfc19: not without actually seeing the code you have problems with
[03:24:23] <rfc19> Cork: there really isn't much to it. It's just a fresh build and I want to disable the buttons. I was thinking of adding a 'disable' class and unsetting that once the page loads
[03:24:47] <Cork> rfc19: but there isn't any html buttons or links
[03:24:53] <Cork> so all the relevant parts has to be in js
[03:25:50] <Cork> DreamStiffler: what is it you're trying to group?
[03:26:00] <rfc19> Cork: Understand. There is some JS. I'll upload it
[03:26:01] <Cork> data.items on line 30?
[03:29:02] <DreamStiffler> Cork: hold on
[03:29:11] <kokut> Cork: jQuery('element_2').attr('style', 'top: ' + jQuery('.element_1').offset().top + 'px');
[03:29:21] <Cork> O_o
[03:29:27] <Cork> kokut: you don't modify style with attr...
[03:29:56] <DreamStiffler> Cork: you could say so
[03:30:16] <Cork> DreamStiffler: say what?!?
[03:30:29] <DreamStiffler> Cork : I want to group 2 of the results to 1 div.
[03:30:39] <kokut> Cork: jQuery(element_1).css('top', jQuery(element_2).offset().top); is the same
[03:30:40] <Cork> ... sure, but WHAT results
[03:30:49] <Cork> kokut: no it isn't
[03:31:04] <Cork> kokut: .attr style blows away anything that exists in the style attribute
[03:31:29] <kokut> Cork: i mean the same as in that its not working in my scenario
[03:31:40] <Cork> same as you shouldn't ever do that
[03:32:35] <kokut> Cork: okay, still not working with css...
[03:34:08] <kokut> Cork: anything else i can try besides manually adding subtracting values?
[03:34:22] <Pazician> Hola. Why does my if statement not trigger on resize? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0486db3e19e53900cb12
[03:34:25] <Cork> i don't even know what it is you're trying to do
[03:34:54] <Cork> Pazician: console.log($(window).width())
[03:35:25] <Cork> Pazician: btw you shouldn't add and remove an event hanlder on resize
[03:35:37] <Cork> set a shared variable and have the event handler react based on it
[03:36:21] <Pazician> Cork: What you mean?
[03:36:50] <Pazician> I did the console.log and the width in console do work, it changes. But what you mean add and remove an event?
[03:37:13] <Cork> Pazician: when width > 640 you add the event handler
[03:37:15] <kokut> Cork: i'm trying to put two elements at the same distance from the top of the document, one is the reference and the other one is set to position:absolute.
[03:37:27] <Cork> and when it resizes again you add another one
[03:37:30] <Cork> and another one
[03:37:42] <Cork> after a few sec you will have hundreds of event handlers bound on #left
[03:37:56] <Cork> instead bind the event handler staticall on #left
[03:38:03] <Cork> (outside the function)
[03:38:16] <Pazician> Cork: Oh, but it doesn't trigger since I need to refresh to update and then it work
[03:38:18] <Cork> and instead set a shared variable to true/false based on width() > 640
[03:38:28] <Cork> Pazician: it does
[03:39:56] <Cork> Pazician: http://jsfiddle.net/u6q4sg95/
[03:41:14] <kokut> Cork: man got any tips?
[03:42:58] <DreamStiffler> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/531La38t/11/ im trying to keep 2 results in 1 div
[03:43:03] <DreamStiffler> every 2 results
[03:43:18] <Pazician> Cork: Thanks, it works now! But what does it mean on line 3, do you define new variable or what does it mean?
[03:47:07] <DreamStiffler> Cork: in keep i meant, i want to display 2 results in one container.and another 2 results in another container
[03:47:19] <hellyeah> hey

[03:48:00] <DreamStiffler> ANJ7: suggested me to use chunked. But ive spent 5 hours on it and figured im not that smart to use it
[03:48:33] <ANJ7> DreamStiffler: wow.
[03:49:12] <DreamStiffler> ANJ7: oops
[03:49:55] <DreamStiffler> ANJ7: i wasnt sure how to combine my array and chunk it
[03:51:06] <ANJ7> DreamStiffler: you were not use the for loop as i said.
[03:51:20] <DreamStiffler> i did
[03:51:47] <DreamStiffler> ANJ7: i did but i took it out already. Basically i wasnt sure how to connect between the 2. As i said my coding sucks
[03:51:59] <DreamStiffler> ANJ7: https://jsfiddle.net/cqw02caw/
[03:55:55] <kokut> DreamStiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/531La38t/13/
[03:59:01] <kokut> DreamStiffler: dunno if thats what u were trying to do
[03:59:57] <DreamStiffler> kokut: looks about right. ill need a few more hours to fuse thsi to some otherscript and see if it turns out to be what i wanted. But yeah i guess so. %2 -this is remainder right
[04:00:24] <DreamStiffler> kokut: whatever it is thank you. im gna start working on it right after i break my fast in few minutes

[04:38:00] <_anli> Strange, I have an a-tag in a jquery object, but .click() on it will not navigate the document...
[04:38:20] <_anli> Can I use specify target using document.location?
[04:38:39] <Cork> _anli: you can't trigger the default action on an a tag
[04:38:57] <Cork> so ya window.location = elm.href
[04:38:57] <_anli> I must have done it a lot of times
[04:39:10] <Cork> _anli: nope, cause it isn't possible
[04:39:23] <_anli> You cannot synthesize clicking a link?
[04:39:40] <Cork> you can't fake a user initiated action no
[04:39:49] <Cork> you can fire all javascript event handlers
[04:39:50] <_anli> Since when?
[04:39:54] <Cork> but the browser won't follow the link
[04:40:02] <Cork> _anli: since ~97
[04:40:05] <_anli> lol
[04:40:15] <Cork> it was possible before
[04:40:29] <Ice_Strike> Have you notice anything wrong with this? $(this).closest("li").html(data);
[04:40:34] <hellyeah> Cork:
[04:40:37] <Cork> but 97-98 they plugged the security hole and denied it
[04:40:42] <Ice_Strike> data contain <li> </li> too
[04:40:51] <hellyeah> do you know jquey modal dialog pop up box
[04:40:56] <Ice_Strike> so basically remove current <li> and replace to new one from data
[04:40:58] <Cork> Ice_Strike: you can't add lis directly inside lis
[04:41:01] <_anli> Ice_Strike: then you have a li in a li
[04:41:02] <hellyeah> humm anyway
[04:41:08] <Ice_Strike> Oh
[04:41:09] <_anli> replaceWith
[04:41:25] <Cork> ?api replaceWith
[04:41:25] <b-ot> Cork: .replaceWith(): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[04:41:32] <Ice_Strike> I will check it out
[04:41:40] <Bjerre> guys is it possible to make an if statement that ask if the variable is defined (like having a set value), and if it is not, the variable will in this example be     textLang = 'textswe';  ?
[04:42:02] <Ice_Strike> Like this?  $(this).closest("li").replaceWith(data);
[04:42:18] <_anli> But I cannot specify target using document.location, right?
[04:42:41] <Uhkis> Bjerre: if (!variable) { variable = 'sverige'; }
[04:43:14] <Bjerre> gonna try Uhkis, nice man
[04:43:23] <Uhkis> Bjerre: note my mad swedish skills! :D
[04:43:25] <Bjerre> I thought you were gonna use a variable like ikea but ok
[04:43:30] <Bjerre> haha yea

[05:41:58] <Oka> o/
[05:42:00] <Abhijit> i moved my jq code inside script tag to another file abhijt.js included it in main code. my web app still loads the old code which was inside script tag and do not load this new code from file. but there is no old code inside main.html? hows that?
[05:42:27] <Oka> Flush your cache?
[05:42:33] <Abhijit> did
[05:42:54] <Abhijit> deleted the localhost cookies
[05:43:37] <Abhijit> Oka, sorry my bad. deleting cooky is not same as cleaning cache!
[05:44:05] <Oka> Yeah, try a forced refresh, or open your dev tools and disable the cache
[05:44:19] <Abhijit> yeah. did. now its working.
[05:45:24] <Abhijit> Oka, when the code was inside script tag my developement python flask code was reflecting changes immediately but now after making changes in file i have to clear cache everytime. how can i avoid this?
[05:46:55] <Abhijit> Oka, i mean restart my python server each time. (not clear cache everytime)
[05:47:37] <Oka> Unfamiliar with flask, not sure what to tell you

[06:04:57] <goldfinger> with a scrolltop function
[06:05:58] <goldfinger> Did i wrtie the jQuery correcT?
[06:06:10] <goldfinger> I don't think jQuery can run such a CSS change
[06:07:05] <decx> just add a class
[06:07:12] <goldfinger> add a class?
[06:07:24] <goldfinger> where?
[06:07:31] <decx> oh before
[06:07:37] <decx> anyway
[06:07:48] <decx> add a class to an element and go from there
[06:08:06] <goldfinger> ok you see that css code?
[06:08:12] <goldfinger> that works for me
[06:08:33] <goldfinger> but I would like that effect to run with a scrolltop effect
[06:08:33] <decx> make a real demo
[06:08:43] <goldfinger> omg, ok i tryh
[06:08:44] <goldfinger> try
[06:11:33] <goldfinger> I can't...
[06:11:36] <goldfinger> ok look this site: https://www.goldrepublic.com/
[06:11:49] <goldfinger> you will see three circles there

[06:19:33] <Abhijit> i am adding video to page by doing this in my jquery $("#videoHolder").html('<video id="example ...........'</video>'); in that i have src="/static/videos/output000.mp4" how can i concatenate a string to src so that i can add next files output001, output002 and so on?
[06:19:48] <static> Abhijit, ? you've tagged me :p

[06:21:55] <static> Abhijit, I do !
[06:22:21] <Bjerre> guys got a little problem. I want the change to take effect imediately when clicking on language button. The text should be replaced when you click on it. http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/62/
[06:23:01] <Abhijit> :-)
[06:25:13] <Abhijit> nvm.
[06:34:09] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/62/ Anyone got an idea on how to make the change of language take place on the active button?
[06:35:55] <Cork> Bjerre: add a <span class="lang1">Lang 1</span> <span class="lang2">Lang 2</span>
[06:36:02] <Cork> and toggle between them with a class
[06:38:22] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/63/ Cork where would you add the toggle? will it work with more than 2 buttons? Got 9 in total
[06:38:55] <Cork> Bjerre: depends on what you need
[06:39:14] <Cork> i would add the class on the closest element wrapping all the elements that are affected by the language change
[06:39:29] <Cork> and have one language visible by default
[06:39:39] <Bjerre> What I need is the text to load up when you hit language button when you're already on an active button
[06:39:44] <Cork> and just toggle a class(toggleClass) to switch to the other one
[06:40:27] <Bjerre> hmm
[06:40:32] <Bjerre> Im not sure I get it
[06:41:14] <Bjerre> I have a language visible already by adding a click to the onload function in the project
[06:41:22] <Bjerre> as well as the default settings have the swedish language
[06:41:56] <Bjerre> should not be added to this code though since this is a secondary page/scene
[06:42:08] <Cork> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/1k2okcac/
[06:42:12] <Bjerre> and the default setting is happening in  another script
[06:42:37] <Bjerre> oh sorry Cork that was not what I ment
[06:42:53] <Bjerre> what I mean is that the text on header 1 and text 1 should change
[06:43:01] <Bjerre> when you are already active on a button
[06:43:11] <Bjerre> it only changes when you click next or the other button
[06:43:40] <Bjerre> it's kinda hard to explain but try click on the language and then another button and you see what I mean
[06:44:00] <Bjerre> the text on the button itself is not important
[06:46:35] <Bjerre> sorry if I explain it badly Cork
[06:56:56] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/62/ anyone who knows on how to make the two text boxes to show the language immediately upon clicking the language button? Right now the change take place after you click on a new button instead of right away.
[06:57:25] <Bjerre> show the new language"""
[06:57:53] <sopparus> if I have $(this).addClass and want $(this)+1 to show
[06:58:01] <sopparus> how can I do that, since var.addClass dont work
[06:58:16] <ceramicskull> What am I doing wrong that it's coming back undefined? http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/ btw that's how my arrays look
[07:00:44] <mbrzuzy> ceramicskull, when inside the first each you can do for (var prop in result) { append('<td>' + result[prop] + '</td>') }
[07:02:23] <ceramicskull> Think you can edit the fiddle so I can see what you mean?
[07:03:19] <decx> you already loop through your object in the second each
[07:03:34] <decx> so element == variation_name and so on
[07:04:09] <ceramicskull> yea, I tried that but it would just return a blank page
[07:04:59] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/e2Lcu3Lh/1/
[07:05:27] <ceramicskull> yea that was my original code
[07:05:36] <ceramicskull> but I need to pick and choose certain keys to leave out
[07:06:37] <ceramicskull> I guess I forgot to show that in the fiddle hmm
[07:06:46] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/e2Lcu3Lh/2/
[07:07:14] <notchris> What’s an easy way to unwrap on multiple levels
[07:07:23] <ceramicskull> Oh wow lol
[07:07:24] <decx> it'll ignore the keys from that array now
[07:07:35] <notchris> If an element is contained by 3 containers for example
[07:08:03] <notchris> $(‘#example’).unwrap.parent().unwrap   ?
[07:08:27] <decx> replace the parent with the element
[07:09:09] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/62/ How do I get the new data to show immediately upon clicking the language button? Right now, the change only takes place after you click language and move to a new button (orange or blue).
[07:09:45] <notchris> decx: TY
[07:09:57] <decx> like thing.parent().parent().replaceWith(thing)
[07:09:59] <ceramicskull> decx now let's say I want to get a bit more technical and change how some of the data is displayed - example: date_time: "2015-06-26T19:22:38Z" and I just want to remove time but keep date, is that possible?
[07:10:13] <DanielCE> Hey guys i got html return with something like that : <script>↵    location.href = "https://paymentgateway/PaymentGW?transactionId=1650eb9";↵</script> , there is a fast way to get the url?
[07:10:23] <decx> you can do whatever you want inside the each
[07:11:27] <notchris> decx: Awesome, worked nicely ty
[07:12:20] <decx> what do you mean DanielCE?
[07:12:32] <decx> this will just get that url
[07:12:33] <ceramicskull> decx can you show me an example? Sorry, this is my first time working with JSON and I've gotten myself up to this point pretty easy, but also thanks for explaining, it really helped!
[07:12:49] <DanielCE> i just the url as a string
[07:13:20] <decx> you wont have the opportunity
[07:13:32] <decx> as soon as this script gets loaded the page will change to that url
[07:13:36] <DanielCE> its not loaded
[07:17:19] <decx> ceramicskull: you can put that string inside a date object and extract the day and month from that
[07:17:27] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/e2Lcu3Lh/3/
[07:18:42] <ceramicskull> Hmmmm, yes ok now it makes sense
[07:18:47] <ceramicskull> thank you so much decx!
[07:21:22] <Ice_Strike2> Should I use "click" when mouse has been clicked on the input text?
[07:21:30] <hellyeah-work> decx:  copy table to a var with its tags sounds logical?
[07:22:55] <decx> what?
[07:23:21] <hellyeah-work> a sec
[07:23:57] <hellyeah-work> decx:  have a table like that http://jsfiddle.net/904xm923/
[07:24:07] <hellyeah-work> decx:  i want to show this table in modal dialog
[07:24:19] <hellyeah-work> when user click button it will show all table in modal dialog
[07:25:20] <hellyeah-work> so just wondering is there a way to copy all tables to something for example outputTable
[07:25:31] <hellyeah-work> so i can show outputTable in modal dialog
[07:26:08] <hellyeah-work> did you understand?
[07:26:48] <ceramicskull> hellyeah-work use foundation framework
[07:26:50] <ceramicskull> it brings a modal
[07:27:20] <ceramicskull> hellyeah-work: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/reveal.html
[07:27:31] <hellyeah-work> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[07:27:36] <hellyeah-work> this one has dialog too
[07:27:42] <notchris> If there is a form on another website (Our donation website)
[07:27:49] <notchris> Can I replicate the form on our website
[07:27:56] <notchris> And send the information to that form externally
[07:27:57] <notchris> And submit it
[07:27:58] <notchris> ?
[07:28:32] <notchris> Or does that break CORS
[07:28:57] <ceramicskull> hellyeah-work look at hte source code then and see what you need to do
[07:29:40] <ceramicskull> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/4/ I added an extra field to see what would happen, but it didn't work? is there a reason behind this?
[07:30:12] <decx> but it works?
[07:30:18] <decx> goal_name isnt added
[07:30:31] <hellyeah-work> i am tired
[07:31:29] <ceramicskull> decx it's in the object
[07:32:19] <ceramicskull> Oh wait.
[07:32:51] <ceramicskull> I was reading it worng
[07:35:25] <ceramicskull> decx nvm! Thanks once again ahah, completely read the logic wrong in it :)
[07:40:13] <ANJ7> hey guys need help
[07:40:56] <ANJ7> anyone there?
[07:41:14] <ANJ7>  When I reload a filled form, the entered fields are getting disappeared. How can I make them not disappear on reload.
[07:53:44] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/62/ How do I get the new data to show immediately upon clicking the language button? Right now, the change only takes place after you click language and move to a new button (orange or blue).

[08:10:31] <dimi1947> cork are yi still here?
[08:26:53] <Duzzy> Hey guys, can someone help me understand why this doesnt work? https://jsfiddle.net/en8ttdey/
[08:27:03] <Duzzy> If I change to != I get the alert
[08:28:49] <vorscore> bjerre: your language button is only setting the vars to the different language copy.  The btn click function contains the part that changes the text.
[08:29:28] <Bjerre> yea I see vorscore, I think you helped me with something similar yesterday but I didn't get it working since I didn't link the whole fiddle
[08:33:18] <Bjerre> Any idea on how to get both vars and click to work together vorscore?
[08:36:02] <vorscore> you could pull that functionality out of the click-function, and put it in a common function both can call.
[08:37:14] <vorscore> Duzzy: val() gets the values of form elements.  You're looking at a table cell.  Try .text()
[08:37:30] <Bjerre> seem too hard for me
[08:37:34] <davesidious> Hey folks - is there a way to detect when content injected by .load() has been rendered?
[08:37:47] <Bjerre> any simple solution?
[08:38:48] <Duzzy> vorscore: now I get the alert if Its empty, but im also getting it if I add some text there
[08:45:40] <Ice_Strike2> Is this correct way to do it for trim check before passing to ajax? http://pastebin.com/GJwXikSw
[08:54:05] <davesidious> meh forget that - is there a way to change the visibility of a selection of elements one after another, with a delay?
[08:54:07] <Bjerre> ok Im off guys
[08:54:11] <Bjerre> hopefully I find a solution tomorrow
[08:54:14] <Bjerre> have a great day
[09:05:45] <Duzzy> grr, why doesnt it print the value? http://jsfiddle.net/en8ttdey/4/
[09:11:23] <Tennis> Duzzy
[09:12:49] <Duzzy> im getting nuts here, all i want to do to check if that <td> tag contains anything or not
[09:12:53] <Duzzy> how hard can it be :S
[09:12:55] <Tennis> make it a table
[09:13:01] <Tennis> <table></table>
[09:13:10] <Tennis> http://jsfiddle.net/en8ttdey/4/
[09:16:59] <Tennis> all good? Duzzy ?
[09:17:04] <Duzzy> lol thanks Tennis
[09:17:10] <Tennis> sweeeet
[09:17:16] <Tennis> np
[09:17:17] <Duzzy> but is that a jquery thing or is it the fiddle that messes with me?
[09:18:13] <Tennis> not sure
[09:19:01] <Tennis> maybe even html5
[09:28:36] <ceramicskull> Tennis, is there a way to round up to the nearest hundreth decimal?
[09:29:03] <decx> divide by 100, round, multiply by 100
[09:29:03] <ceramicskull> google gives me shit that has nothing to do with what I'm asking lol
[09:29:14] <ceramicskull> Hm
[09:29:18] <ceramicskull> I was doing it wrong then
[09:29:23] <ceramicskull> I was rounding first
[09:33:02] <cek> any handler that would only handle enter press in text field?
[09:33:17] <robertmaxrees> keydown?
[09:33:22] <robertmaxrees> then test what key was pressed.
[09:40:50] <diegoviola> I'm getting some comments from ajax via posting.done() and I append the results like this: $("#container-messages").prepend("<div class='panel panel-info'><div class='panel-heading'><h4>Assistente</h4></div><div class='panel-body'>"+data+"</div></div>");
[09:41:38] <diegoviola> I'm trying to add some stars to comments via raty plugin: http://wbotelhos.com/raty but I'm not sure how to add the rating dynamically to a div without duplicating the stars
[09:42:54] <diegoviola> I can do $(".star").raty(); but then if I have 100 comments with the .star div it'll be applying yet another star div to the 100 comments
[09:42:56] <diegoviola> I don't want that
[09:42:58] <diegoviola> any ideas?
[09:50:40] <robertmaxrees> diegoviola are you adding them to new content you're loading in or what?
[09:51:30] <tash> $('#datepicker').datepicker();  How can I get that to do YYYY-MM-DD?
[09:51:45] <tash> default is MM/DD/YYYY
[09:52:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-formats
[09:53:02] <tash> robertmaxrees: yeah, was already there and tried what I thought was going to work, but didn't. I might have misunderstood what I'm supposed to do though.
[09:53:13] <robertmaxrees> :) make a fiddle and show what you tried.
[09:53:53] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees so yea, it's not coming out the way I want T_T. So I have a number like this: -0.02248333852001834 - I want it to look like this -2.24 now, I can get it easily to -2 but I can't seem to get the decimals in there because of the rounding.
[09:54:22] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull so you want to move the decimal over a few places and then round up?
[09:54:31] <ceramicskull> yea
[09:54:49] <diegoviola> robertmaxrees: yes
[09:55:32] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull as a warning - math in js is rarely a good idea, that being said, just multiply the number to move the decimal a few places and then do your rounding.
[09:56:07] <ceramicskull> yea, I tried that, but it comes back as 0 ;l
[09:56:15] <robertmaxrees> diegoviola you could do like thedata.find('.ratings').pluginName()
[09:56:17] <Uranium|OC> hahaha
[09:56:34] <Uranium|OC> let me find you a post someone shared with me when i had this problem 1 minute ceramicskull
[09:56:47] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xbu21rm5/
[09:56:50] <robertmaxrees> so you start here...
[09:57:04] <Uranium|OC> http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html
[09:57:04] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull also do you want true rounding?
[09:57:10] <decx> Math.round(n*10000)/100
[09:57:41] <diegoviola> robertmaxrees: thanks
[09:58:14] <tash> robertmaxress: http://jsfiddle.net/o596brgL/ It's probably something really stupid, but I'm just learning so oh well
[09:58:28] <tash> sdate doesn't work, edate does
[09:58:49] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xbu21rm5/1/
[09:58:52] <ceramicskull> well decx solution worked great. I kept adding zeros in the wrong place it seems.
[09:59:27] <ceramicskull> Thanks all
[10:00:28] <dimi1947> do you see anything wrong with this code?     $("#appsnumber").remove();
[10:00:53] <dimi1947> I am just trying to remove an input element from the DOM
[10:01:11] <decx> tash: you're using the options method
[10:01:20] <decx> this assumes that the datepicker is already initialized
[10:03:39] <tash> decx: hmm
[10:03:59] <decx> init with the options as an object
[10:04:22] <decx> .datepicker({ 'dateFormat': 'yy/mm/dd' });
[10:06:14] <tash> thank you
[10:07:20] <decx> the way they do it in the example with the select is nice to change it on the fly but probably a bit confusing for newer people
[10:07:48] <diegoviola> robertmaxrees: that worked great, thanks
[10:14:05] <jayjo> does append put it IN the element or AFTER the selected dom element?
[10:14:30] <robertmaxrees> "The .append() method inserts the specified content as the last child of each element in the jQuery collection."
[10:14:51] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: meaning in the selection?
[10:14:57] <jayjo> is that what the jQuery collection is?
[10:15:18] <robertmaxrees> yes - $('someselector') <- this returns a jquery collection.
[10:15:39] <robertmaxrees> "last child" means that .append() inserts your content as the last child of each item in that collection.
[10:17:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/n6shwg5j/ shows it.

[10:27:00] <rcyr> Woohoo
[10:27:06] <arthurvr> Yay robertmaxrees
[10:27:07] <robertmaxrees> hah, they got k-lined.
[10:27:09] <jayjo> thanks
[10:27:23] <arthurvr> was just on it but you was quicker :p
[10:27:28] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[10:30:34] <jayjo> For some reason I can't add the src to an image tag with $('#display-image').attr('src', value)
[10:30:39] <jayjo> is there a better way to do it?
[10:31:28] <rcyr> That should work
[10:34:59] <jayjo> This doesn't adjust the src of the img tag: https://bpaste.net/show/beba4348b5d6
[10:36:55] <dgrove> $.post and $.ajax({method:'POST'}) are appending a trailing / onto my url when i have a query param added. Our api requires ?csrfToken=token. Any ideas how to fix it? (jQuery 2.1.4)
[10:37:22] <robertmaxrees> jayjo String(data) - just do data
[10:37:41] <jayjo> I did that as well, robertmaxrees
[10:37:57] <jayjo> my server just returns the relative url
[10:38:04] <jayjo> but js isn't putting it on the element
[10:38:12] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming?
[10:39:28] <jayjo> I have the console log there to see if it executes the block (it does) and I just put an alert(data) in and it returns the string I'd like to append
[10:39:45] <jayjo> do I need to delay or something so it has enough time to create the element before it does anything else?
[10:39:59] <robertmaxrees> the .append() is a synchronous operation.
[10:40:01] <robertmaxrees> so no, you don't.
[10:40:23] <robertmaxrees> do a console.log($('#display-image').attr("src")); before your "here we are" - what do you get?
[10:41:04] <delgiudices> if i have a lot of elements with the same id
[10:41:14] <delgiudices> why does $(“#id”) returns an array with only 1 element
[10:41:31] <rcyr> delgiudices: Your HTML is invalid.
[10:41:36] <robertmaxrees> because you can't use an ID more than once, delgiudices
[10:41:43] <niko> robertmaxrees: hi, do you Sigyn in there ( she's replacing idoru )
[10:41:45] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: it prints "undefined"
[10:41:55] <robertmaxrees> jayjo try selecting just that ID...
[10:41:58] <robertmaxrees> nikfluff huh?
[10:42:02] <bryanbailes> I have an array of widget names var widgetArray = [ 'progressbar', 'accordion', 'dialog' ] and I want to instantiate each without using eval(). Is this possible?
[10:42:04] <robertmaxrees> err, niko  - huh?
[10:42:27] <niko> it's a freenode bot which takes care of spammer and various attacks
[10:42:43] <robertmaxrees> niko we don't usually have need for something like that :)
[10:43:02] <niko> ok, feel free to ping me if needed :)
[10:43:12] <nikfluff> robertmaxrees: ?
[10:43:17] <nikfluff> ah nvm
[10:43:28] <robertmaxrees> bryanbailes why would you do that?
[10:43:49] <bryanbailes> JSON config file lists all widgets needed for a particular instance
[10:43:50] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: groooan... I had id="#.." instead of id=".."
[10:43:53] <jayjo> but fixed :)
[10:43:58] <robertmaxrees> jayjo :)
[10:44:07] <robertmaxrees> bryanbailes that's... funky.
[10:46:58] <decx> we've all been there
[10:46:59] <robertmaxrees> but you can do widgetArray.forEach(function(theName) { $('.someElement')[theName](); });
[10:47:00] <robertmaxrees> but that looks gross.
[10:47:03] <bryanbailes> I can get into why, but figured you wouldn't want the explanation. More or less, each widget costs money. There is already a Require config file telling it which widgets to include in the build. I wanted to use that same config file to instantiate each widget.
[10:47:04] <robertmaxrees> bryanbailes that sounds really funky.  it's just a gross way to do it is all.
[10:47:37] <bryanbailes> I don't disagree. But, it makes it easy when shipping a product: just change the require config.
[10:47:54] <bryanbailes> Suggestions on a better way to handle it?
[10:48:25] <robertmaxrees> without understanding more about the problem, not really - sounds like you have a weird edge case going on.
[11:11:46] <bryanbailes> @robertmaxrees: It worked perfectly! Thank you!
[11:12:37] <nezZario> Sigh, back with more Datatables woes.  I'm trying to find how to do this: http://www.datatables.net/forums/discussion/542/dynamically-change-idisplaylength in DT 1.10, those methods/properties no longer exist
[11:12:52] <nezZario> I'm essentially trying to "fake" the total entries count
[11:33:42] <solis> Hey guys, Im learning javascript and am wondering if you could direct me to good resources. Im in the jQuery room because I know Ill end up here soon.
[11:34:13] <rcyr> !eloquent @ solis
[11:34:19] <rcyr> Err, wrong channel :/
[11:34:33] <rcyr> solis: A lot of people start with http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[11:35:42] <solis> rcyr: thanks! Ill read it. Right now Im finishing codeacademy. Could any of you direct me to a more 'general' javascript channel? ...other than #javascript
[11:36:10] <rcyr> solis: #JavaScript is pretty much the place... but #Web will also answer questions.
[11:41:23] <Razerglass> $(this).html()    will return  <a href="www.abc.com" title="View Link">LinkName</a>   how would I get the link??
[11:41:33] <Razerglass> $(this).attr('href') returns undefined
[11:43:07] <arc_> why other than #javascript anyway
[11:43:53] <taplar> $(this).find('a') would get it or you could get the first .children() element
[11:44:48] <szzege> Hey robertmaxrees and co
[11:44:49] <Razerglass> taplar   $(this).find('a').attr('href')  perfect :) thanks
[11:44:53] <szzege> how's your day
[11:45:53] <arc_> i don't get it. $(this).attr('href'); should work
[11:46:02] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/Ljhqj3v5/
[11:46:19] <arc_> oh, because $(this) isn't a, it's the parent
[11:46:20] <arc_> nevermind
[11:46:34] <Razerglass> yeah i realized that too
[11:51:17] <szzege> what other languages are you all coding in except javascript?
[11:51:30] <szzege> I'm wanting to extend my skillset and wondering what's up these days
[11:51:32] <Uranium|OC> kk searched for 30 minutes,   why the fuck does $("input[name='productsz']:checked").val(); RETURN "on"
[11:52:06] <arthurvr> szzege: personally I’m a fan of haskell, swift and I’m getting my feed wet with rust.
[11:52:13] <arthurvr> used to do a bunch of php and python
[11:52:20] <arthurvr> glad I dropped php :p
[11:52:24] <anom> var data = '<span></span>', data = $(data).prepend('test').html();
[11:52:30] <taplar> Uranium|OC: is the element a radio button?
[11:52:35] <anom> How can I have this so it returns <span>test</span>
[11:52:35] <Uranium|OC> yes
[11:52:38] <anom> rather than 'test' ?
[11:53:30] <taplar> Uranium|OC: there's something to radio buttons.  value I believe reflects their state
[11:53:34] <diegoviola> I have some code like this: $("#container-messages").prepend("<div class='panel panel-default'><div class='panel-heading'><h4>Usuario</h4></div><div class='panel-body'>"+term+"</div></div>");
[11:53:41] <szzege> and others?
[11:53:43] <diegoviola> how do I break it so that it fits into 80 columns?
[11:54:01] <Uranium|OC> taplar /me shrugs never had issues with radios before not sure wtf is different been driving me nuts
[11:54:12] <taplar> diegoviola: use fragments and append to the fragments, and at the end append to that parent element
[11:54:47] <diegoviola> taplar: hrm, can you give an example?
[11:55:35] <rcyr> diegoviola: string concatenation :)
[11:55:45] <taplar> var $parent = $('existing selector');  var $newchild = $('<div>');  $newchild.append('blah'); $newchild.append('blah2'); $parent.prepend($newchild);
[11:55:51] <diegoviola> thanks
[11:56:32] <anom> http://jsbin.com/qenijumoku/1/edit?js,console anyone? :(
[11:58:05] <taplar> anom: .prop('outerHTML')
[11:58:40] <taplar> html() just gets the contents
[11:59:01] <arthurvr> html as a getter returns the innerHTML
[11:59:07] <taplar> yeah
[11:59:12] <anom> hmmph
[11:59:14] <arthurvr> just get the outer version as taplar said
[12:00:03] <anom> tar
[12:13:57] <jqueryuser> hello friends, i have a question on how I can get the first text in this element:  http://pastebin.com/pRPYDP5T  i am trying to access "Member"   currently this is what I have that is returning this html   $(this).parent().find('div.smalltext').html()
[12:15:56] <rcyr> You probably can't access it with jQuery. Can you modify the HTML to wrap that "Member" work with a span?
[12:17:29] <taplar> you'd have to do something funky with text() and splitting it maybe on whitespace and guess the position that you needed to reference.  what rcyr suggests would be a much cleaner option
[12:17:36] <anom> http://jsbin.com/jujiheduka/1/edit could someone explain why the heck this is happening?
[12:17:58] <taplar> anom: what is 'this' ?
[12:18:03] <rcyr> If you don't mind reverting to Vanilla DOM, you can access text nodes.
[12:18:26] <anom> If I remove <p> or <div> it works, for some reason the each is counting those elements
[12:18:54] <anom> even though I have: $('.row').each(function() {
[12:18:55] <taplar> anom: p and div are children of the parent
[12:19:05] <taplar> so it affects the index
[12:19:17] <rcyr> .index() is the index of the child related to its parent.
[12:19:25] <rcyr> Don't use that.
[12:19:47] <rcyr> It's just good at making brittle code.
[12:20:57] <taplar> if you want the iteration index, look at the documentation of each().  i believe there is a form that will pass in the index of the each
[12:22:16] <taplar> ?api each
[12:22:16] <b-ot> taplar: .each(): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.  http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:23:09] <anom> http://jsbin.com/kegeteqaya/1/edit?html,js,console,output so thats how it's suppose to be done, right?
[12:24:07] <taplar> i wouldn't say that's how it is done
[12:24:18] <taplar> its better to say, is that your desired result
[12:24:31] <garethdaine> Guys, I’m selecting all form input fields with $('.content form input') but I only want to select them if they are not part of a form with the id #destroy. How woudl I do this, I’ve tried the :not selector but it doesn;t work, obviously.
[12:24:51] <rcyr> anom: Yup, but it would be easier for us to help if you told us what's the point of that code :)
[12:25:01] <taplar> garethdaine: how did you try the not?
[12:25:08] <dnano91> hi, i have defined a class based on click event. after one click i want to override it for this element and use another method onclick. how can i do this?
[12:25:12] <decx> jqueryuser: change the html
[12:25:19] <decx> oh i'm scrolled
[12:25:19] <taplar> garethdaine: i think it would be .content form:not(#destroy) input
[12:25:33] <dnano91> using $(this).removeAttr('onclick') doesn't work. the original event is still called
[12:25:55] <taplar> ?api off
[12:25:55] <b-ot> taplar: .off(): Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[12:25:59] <taplar> ^ dnano91
[12:26:19] <garethdaine> taplar: Of course, bloody hell, thanks dude
[12:27:29] <taplar> dnano91: also if you want an event to only happen once, you can bind with .one
[12:27:32] <taplar> ?api one
[12:27:32] <b-ot> taplar: .one(): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[12:29:11] <dnano91> taplar: thanks. i'll go with .one() then. inside it i use another .on() to attach a different event, but it doesn't work
[12:30:01] <dnano91> taplar: the second event should be carried out every click after the first one has been activated
[12:30:16] <taplar> dnano91: got a fiddle?
[12:30:31] <jqueryuser> is there a way to grab the FIRST text in a element?
[12:30:44] <Bjerre> hello taplar :)
[12:30:48] <dnano91> taplar: i'll prepare one
[12:30:52] <taplar> hey Bjerre :)
[12:30:59] <robertmaxrees> "first text", jqueryuser?
[12:31:04] <robertmaxrees> examplke?
[12:32:16] <jqueryuser> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/pRPYDP5T   you see the first text "Member" isnt in any class or anything how can i select it?
[12:32:37] <robertmaxrees> can you give more of an example?
[12:32:37] <jqueryuser> using .text will give me "Offline"
[12:32:43] <robertmaxrees> like is this contained within another element?
[12:33:00] <dnano91> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/60pduhkp/
[12:33:18] <diegoviola> why do some examples leave spaces like this: $( document ) instead of $(document)?
[12:33:23] <diegoviola> is that just preference?
[12:33:29] <garethdaine> taplar: That doesn’t seem to work. I’m doing this http://kopy.io/1CX3W but I still always get formHasChanged = true; though I want to only check inputs in forms where the form id is not #destroy
[12:33:32] <robertmaxrees> diegoviola coding style.
[12:33:37] <jqueryuser> robertmaxrees that paste bine is from $(this).next().html()  im already inside the element, i just need to know how to select the text in it
[12:33:37] <diegoviola> robertmaxrees: ok thanks
[12:34:14] <taplar> dnano91: your second on is not binding properly
[12:34:16] <robertmaxrees> jqueryuser also - why do you need that text?
[12:34:22] <taplar> dnano91: your actually executing that function, not binding
[12:34:39] <jqueryuser> im going to be running a boolean on weather it is a 'member' or not
[12:34:40] <dnano91> taplar: text is just a placeholder for now. how can i bind it then?
[12:34:43] <taplar> dnano91: you need to wrap it in an anonymous function
[12:34:45] <decx> jqueryuser: if the markup cant be changed and is consistent you can do .contents().get(8).textContent to get and change that text
[12:34:50] <dnano91> taplar: okay
[12:35:24] <decx> i assume this is for some user script
[12:35:28] <sopparus> hello
[12:35:36] <jqueryuser> yes it is, changing the html is not a option
[12:35:49] <dnano91> taplar: works :) thanks
[12:36:00] <decx> well instead of html() do that contents thing
[12:36:01] <sopparus> is it ossible to modify data(css) only where <td data-id="02"> for example
[12:36:04] <decx> that'll do
[12:36:26] <taplar> garethdaine: you might have to break it up.  maybe like $('.content form').not('#destroy').find('input')
[12:37:18] <garethdaine> taplar: Possibly, though I don’t think the not is the issue now as formHasChanged is true when editing fields on forms outside of .content
[12:37:35] <taplar> k
[12:38:59] <garethdaine> Which is weird, just realised the form with the id destroy is outside of the .content div. Surely with this $('.content form input') I’m only selecting forms within that div?
[12:39:40] <taplar> any element that has a class content that has a nested form that has nested inputs
[12:40:16] <garethdaine> Exactly, so the form with id destroy doesn;t fit that criteria
[12:40:26] <taplar> as you've described it, no
[12:41:26] <Bjerre> taplar do you remember this? :P http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/63/   I've added a button to change language on the divboxes' text. However, the change only occurs after you click on a new button. Any idea on how to make it change the language right away?
[12:42:11] <taplar> Bjerre: it's gotten larger, :D
[12:42:18] <Bjerre> The reason why it's happening is because I only change the var, not the dom itself I assume. No idea on how to make combine them though
[12:42:21] <Bjerre> haha yes
[12:42:25] <Bjerre> a little bit
[12:42:38] <garethdaine> So something else is causing this then. I’m reloading the form elements via AJAX after a delet request, so I believe that becuase one of the form elements no longer exists, that is why it’s failing
[12:43:37] <taplar> Bjerre: uh, if you want to set it at the start, i might suggest extracting the toggle check and value setting into it's own function, and on load call that function with the element
[12:44:08] <Bjerre> I'm not sure on how taplar but I guess that is right
[12:44:19] <taplar> hold on
[12:45:35] <jayjo> if I send json back from the server, do I need to do a JSON.parse() on the object?
[12:45:38] <jayjo> or can I read it natively?
[12:45:49] <robertmaxrees> depends
[12:45:58] <Bjerre> hi robertmaxrees
[12:45:58] <taplar> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/64/
[12:46:00] <Bjerre> :)
[12:46:04] <taplar> maybe something like that
[12:46:20] <jayjo> right now I'm getting the Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o
[12:46:28] <jayjo> I think it's because I'm trying to parse the json
[12:46:31] <rcyr> jayjo: You need to parse it because it will be a string "BUT", you can "ask" jquery to do it for you.
[12:47:04] <Bjerre> taplar it's stuck on my end
[12:47:14] <Bjerre> wait gonna try ff
[12:47:20] <rcyr> jayjo: By adding dataType: 'json' to $.ajax or by passing 'json' to $.post, jQuery will do the parsing and you'll get an object in the callback
[12:47:49] <Bjerre> didn't work in ff :(
[12:48:11] <_u2pop_> hello all
[12:48:25] <Bjerre> hello _u2pop_
[12:48:46] <Bjerre> taplar it is locked down on my screen. The buttons doesn't work. Any idea?

[12:55:19] <_u2pop_> so can help me?
[12:55:22] <robertmaxrees> either way, _u2pop_ we're not going to help you rig anything.
[12:55:31] <robertmaxrees> just go to the page and vote once an hour.  done.
[12:55:39] <Bjerre> ^
[12:56:11] <Bjerre> or use a mobile phone as well and do it twice an hour
[12:56:23] <robertmaxrees> brb 1 sec.
[12:59:04] <Bjerre> taplar did you get the same as I did with your version of the fiddle? nothing works
[12:59:34] <Bjerre> or have you added something that I am supposed to find or I will get kicked? :(

[13:04:31] <Bjerre> hmm that didn't help with taplars code :/
[13:15:57] <Bjerre> If any gentle soul could help me that would be awesome. I'm trying to change the text when clicking on the language button but since it's only the vars that's changing, the effect takes place only after you click on a new button. Anyone who got an idea on how to solve it that would be awesome: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/65/

[13:26:44] <SkNix> BR?
[13:28:00] <SkNix> hello, as I do with jquery, to type a letter in a texfield?
[13:35:51] <tasaif> $(selector).val('Letters in the text field');
[13:40:11] <glowdemon1> Hiya, I've got 4 radio buttons, is there a simpler way to check if one of them is checked
[13:40:16] <glowdemon1> rather than a long if statement
[13:42:50] <sunevil> hi all!!
[13:43:12] <tasaif> glowdemon1, you can use css selectors
[13:43:27] <tasaif> also, do you mean radio or checkbox?
[13:43:33] <glowdemon1> radio
[13:43:35] <tasaif> ok
[13:43:39] <tasaif> try
[13:43:51] <sunevil> is it possible to interact with other elements when i open a modal window(bootstrap modal)??? like a jquery-ui popup?
[13:43:55] <tasaif> $('.some-class:checked').length
[13:44:17] <tasaif> sunevil, bind to the open event (check the documentation)
[13:46:57] <SkNix> tasaif.. accurate typing.
[13:47:00] <Uhkis> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/430o0mmb/66/ like this?

[13:47:49] <_u2pop_> SkNix saludo paisano :P
[13:47:56] <SkNix> using val ('text') .. the site does not perform the action you would perform if it were typing on the pc keyboard
[13:48:00] <SkNix> saludo
[13:48:05] <SkNix> _u2pop_,
[13:48:29] <_u2pop_> aqui matandome con una pagina que no eh podido resolver casi hehehe
[13:48:32] <SkNix> como simulando um teclado, teclando o 'espao' do teclado
[13:48:37] <sunevil> tasaif, with show.bs.modal??
[13:49:21] <SkNix> o que quer fazer? eu sou muito ruim com jquery.. rsrs.. no sou bom em frontend
[13:49:49] <tasaif> sunevil, that looks right
[13:49:54] <tasaif> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-events
[13:52:08] <glowdemon1> If I have a rather long if statement, is it possible to check which value returned false?
[13:52:32] <glowdemon1> without doing individual checks
[13:58:47] <tasaif> glowdemon1, :not(:checked)
[14:07:47] <Bjerre> Uhkis
[14:07:52] <Bjerre> you're fucking great

[15:15:40] <goodenough> What does the $ represent when using jQuery?
[15:16:32] <robertmaxrees>  the jquery object.
[15:16:46] <robertmaxrees> $ = jQuery
[15:24:22] <glowdemon1> is .prop( checked ) reliable?
[15:24:41] <robertmaxrees> .prop('checked') you mean?
[15:24:55] <glowdemon1> Ya
[15:30:59] <rcyr> Can't have more reliable than that
[15:41:27] <acidjazz> HI ROBERTMAXREES
[15:46:32] <robertmaxrees> hello
[15:47:29] <acidjazz> we cool still
[15:47:41] <robertmaxrees> were we ever not cool?
[15:47:50] <acidjazz> i thought we have beef with our stereoselectorism
[15:48:12] <acidjazz> selehitlerism
[15:48:24] <acidjazz> NIEN. MUST BE EXACT
[15:48:36] <acidjazz> actually i had more code i wanted to show off and get your 2c on style
[15:48:39] <acidjazz> but i need to finish it 1st
[15:49:48] <majuscule> I'm running some code in a callback on children().fadeout, but when there are no children, the callback doesn't get executed. how can i force it to always execute?
[15:54:48] <majuscule> looks like .promise().done(fn..) is what i needed :-)
[16:30:47] <Lencl> if I add elements to a div dynamically.. the $("div").find() is supposed to work dynamically, right?
[16:31:22] <acidjazz> Lencl: yes as long as its run after they are placed
[16:52:17] <Jisan> hello

[16:53:23] <Jisan> its job is to find the phone numbers in plain text and turn them into tel: links
[16:53:42] <Jisan> working fine on desktop, but on iphone and ipad. it shows the phone number twice
[16:53:47] <Jisan> can somebody give me a hint please
[17:27:23] <majuscule> Not sure if there's a better place for this question but does anyone know how animation options work with masonry v3?
[17:31:45] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[17:33:09] <majuscule> robertmaxrees: seems like a lot has changed, animationOptions no longer has any effect, i can't seem to find any documentation on it
[17:33:44] <majuscule> there is now http://masonry.desandro.com/options.html#transitionduration, but nothing else
[17:34:01] <robertmaxrees> http://desandro.github.io/masonry/docs/animating.html
[17:34:08] <robertmaxrees> ah new version.
[17:34:14] <robertmaxrees> dunno then

[17:39:06] <pokergod> What is the best way to upload files that supports all browser or most of them?
[17:39:47] <tw2113> i think all browsers support file upload.
[17:39:55] <robertmaxrees> pokergod do you mean ajax or normally?
[17:40:01] <pokergod> ajax
[17:40:06] <ziikutv> Hello, why can't I do percent here? $( 'img' ).css('max-width', '+=1.1') /* intention is to increment width by 10 so 100,110,120% etc.. */
[17:40:56] <ziikutv> so '+=100%' is getting detected as '+=100' px.
[17:41:42] <ziikutv> or thats what I am noticing in the DOM and inspector.
[17:42:38] <ziikutv> here is a bit more of code: https://bpaste.net/show/23ffd57bc07b
[17:51:13] <ziikutv> Here is my, very crude solution: https://bpaste.net/show/042adafdc393
[17:52:16] <shoky> ziikutv: because you can't. because += works only with pixel values
[17:53:25] <ziikutv> shoky: What would be an alternative for me then? I am basically making a crude way to zoom in and out on an image. This doesnt zoom in/out on/from a particular location just scales the image to the right right/bottom (which is fine at this stage)
[17:56:55] <shoky> that's more of a css question, but if you wanted the equivalent of +=100%  you can take the current width and double it, e.g.  $('img').css('max-width', function(i, value) { return parseInt(value) * 2 })
[17:57:03] <shoky> ziikutv ^
[17:57:36] <ziikutv> mhm
[17:57:44] <ziikutv> okay I will ask them :) thanks for that
[17:59:42] <ziikutv> Also the keymaps will remain same regardless of platform right? i.e: the Z and z key's keycode will remain same regardless of the browser.
[18:29:15] <acmehandle> What is the jquery equivalent to javascript valueOf()
[18:29:23] <acmehandle> I would like to create an alert()
[18:32:53] <ycon_> Hi all, I've been trying for a couple days to get the "setTimout" funciotn working. Any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/ajtevxaj/42/
[18:34:20] <ziikutv> ycon_: I can help what is it that you are trying to do ? Code is kind of wiered.
[18:34:29] <arc_> something wrong with the html
[18:34:53] <arc_> form open tag is inside label, but form close tag is outside
[18:35:08] <ziikutv> arc_: look at his timeout.. does that even make sense..
[18:35:14] <ycon_> ziikutv thanks. Just a basic search pop-out when the search icon is clicked. Then for it to disappear after a time and/or when I scroll
[18:35:25] <arc_> there is no input close tag
[18:35:32] <arc_> for the first one
[18:36:27] <arc_> i don't think you can call settimeout like that, but i'm no expert
[18:37:29] <ycon_> arc- I see. this is all very new to me and I've been hacking away at it for days
[18:38:39] <arc_> and your remove isn't referencing anything
[18:39:00] <arc_> yeah i don't really know what you are trying to accomplish with this
[18:39:44] <ziikutv> ycon_: Here is an exmaple of the timer working.. click on the lorem text and see what happens.. https://jsfiddle.net/ajtevxaj/42/
[18:40:34] <ziikutv> ycon_: Youw ant something similar in that when the search box is clicked you show a div and then after sometime hide it again.
[18:40:37] <ycon_> ziikutv thanks but I think you forgot to save- it's the same fiddle
[18:41:02] <ziikutv> ycon_: http://jsfiddle.net/ajtevxaj/43/
[18:43:32] <ycon_> I've been fiddlign with this one (which is basically right) but I can reposition the search box peoperly...
[18:43:40] <ziikutv> ycon_: After fixing the markup, one thing is for sure. You need that timeout inside the .click trigger not outside like it is currenly.
[18:44:28] <ziikutv> and if you can explain what you want done in your line 9. Then we can help you fix that as it currently makes zero sense. I am talking about line 9 from the fiddle you posted.
[18:45:07] <ycon_> line 9 of the HTML? I think my problem is I tried doin JS's job with CSS...
[18:46:32] <ziikutv> ycon_: Yeah but what are you tright to do there..
[18:49:18] <ycon_> ziikutv: I've got one div too many I think.'
[18:58:37] <ziikutv> ycon_: Disecting your requirements I have uppercased some words you can google or sarch the docs. There are plenty of examples that should help. Wish to show search box when search button is clicked
[18:58:37] <ziikutv> hide the box when out of focus or scrolled.
[18:58:37] <ziikutv> I suggest you encompass the input field in another div (or the entire form)
[18:58:37] <ziikutv> - When button is CLICKED
[18:58:37] <ziikutv>   - SHOW div containing form/input
[18:58:38] <ziikutv> - When entire div/form/input is out of focus
[18:58:39] <ziikutv> - When SCROLL is detected
[18:58:39] <ziikutv>   - HIDE div
[19:01:13] <ycon_> Thanks, I think I'll give up on my own created one and use someone who's gotten closer
[19:01:50] <ziikutv> ycon_: Yeah I am also on #css and saw the one posted by the other member. its great. You willneed to make some changes but he/she did exactly what I just outlined above
[19:02:41] <ziikutv> ycon_: Well im glad you got it figured out :)
[19:04:38] <gambl0re> how hard is it if i want to retrieve data from google or twitters api
[19:04:40] <ycon_> Thanks. It just surprises how much jquery is needed for something so basic
[19:04:47] <gambl0re> i always wanted to try..
[19:05:26] <ziikutv> gambl0re: I do not think it makes sense to talk about that here but its fairly easy once you get hang of API integration.
[19:06:10] <lyxus> Hello folks, I must be doing something wrong, I am trying to serialize my form so I can have a key/value pair JSON. I am using   JSON.stringify( $("#myform1").serializeArray()), which prodive a list of key value pair
[19:07:02] <lyxus> what am i missing
[19:07:08] <gambl0re> what channel should i join to talk about api
[19:09:29] <ycon_> gambl0re: I also need to discuss this somewhere. Is there a channel to discuss API's?
[19:11:50] <gambl0re> lets joing the 3 people #api channel
[19:12:09] <gambl0re> im already in..
[19:13:17] <ycon_> me too
[19:14:27] <gambl0re> i dont see you
[19:25:15] <lyxus> Can anyone give me a hand on why jquery serilize my data http://jsbin.com/xoyamujavi/edit?html,js,output
[19:26:16] <lyxus> I am expecting to receieve a Json and all i have is the list of field appened with +
[19:35:27] <Max-P> Ask a question and leave 10 minutes after. Some people -_-
[19:37:01] <gambl0re> time is money...
[19:37:23] <HowardwLo> what are those popups that prompt a login called? they look like alert();
[19:37:29] <gambl0re> we dont have all day to wait..
[19:37:35] <HowardwLo> and have a message, login/password field
[19:37:44] <gambl0re> modal
[19:37:56] <HowardwLo> no it’s more crude than a modal
[19:38:03] <HowardwLo> and its not a popup window
[19:38:26] <HowardwLo> usually like “Authentication required”
[19:39:13] <gambl0re> not sure sorry.
[19:39:24] <HowardwLo> ah these thigns: http://i.stack.imgur.com/vlfZc.jpg
[19:40:25] <Max-P> It's HTTP Basic auth. It's a server-side thing
[19:44:17] <Max-P> HowardwLo: Basically, you need to return an HTTP 401 error to the browser, and that will trigger the auth popup
[19:45:01] <Max-P> Then you get the data back on the server side in the "Authorization" header, which is base64 encoded.
[19:46:55] <HowardwLo> thanks Max-P
[20:04:45] <d3m0n> Anyone use jquery.validate?
[20:04:57] <d3m0n> It seems it doesn't validate emails properly. I can enter email@email and it validates.
[20:09:12] <Shebbi> d3m0n: You can't 100% validate e-mails.
[20:09:29] <d3m0n> Shebbi: You should be able to validate tld extension
[20:09:55] <d3m0n> Or the very least have a regex for a "." dot something.
[20:09:57] <Shebbi> what's tld?
[20:10:05] <d3m0n> Top level domain,
[20:10:11] <d3m0n> .com, .net, .org
[20:10:20] <Shebbi> d3m0n: google regex email validation
[20:11:24] <d3m0n> Shebbi: First result gives me tld extension validation.
[20:11:35] <d3m0n> ^(([a-zA-Z]{1})|([a-zA-Z]{1}[a-zA-Z]{1})|([a-zA-Z]{1}[0-9]{1})|([0-9]{1}[a-zA-Z]{1})|([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{1,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]))\.([a-zA-Z]{2,6}|[a-zA-Z0-9-]{2,30}\.[a-zA-Z]{2,3})$
[20:11:45] <Shebbi> d3m0n: use it
[20:11:47] <d3m0n> Notice: \.[a-zA-Z]{2,3})$
[20:12:05] <d3m0n> Shebbi: My original question was why jquery.validate doesn't do it.
[20:12:18] <d3m0n> I know I can do use it. I am confused why a popular plugin doesn't.
[20:16:58] <ryanneufeld> d3m0n: likely becuase the author wrote that part of it long before the new TLD's were a thing
[20:17:14] <ryanneufeld> and he's pretty busy with his day job as well i'm sure.
[20:17:35] <d3m0n> The last update was 2 days ago
[20:17:38] <d3m0n> On the repo
[20:17:45] <ryanneufeld> was it to that code?
[20:17:48] <d3m0n> New TLDs been around for atleast 2 years
[20:17:55] <ryanneufeld> are there any bugs?
[20:17:59] <d3m0n> And its not new tlds its any tlds
[20:18:03] <d3m0n> .com
[20:18:05] <ryanneufeld> have you opened a ticket?
[20:18:13] <ryanneufeld> or submitted a patch?
[20:18:20] <d3m0n> Nope, figured I'd ask here if anyone knew anything
[20:18:23] <ryanneufeld> Jorn's a pretty busy guy, I'm sure he'd love the help
[20:18:33] <ryanneufeld> he's also very friendly
[20:18:37] <d3m0n> Or if I am even maybe messing it up
[20:18:52] <ryanneufeld> so open a ticket, and ask him nicely for the feature
[20:19:04] <d3m0n> ryanneufeld: Sounds good :) Thanks
[20:19:09] <ryanneufeld> if you didn't know already, he's a core jquery dev
[20:19:30] <ryanneufeld>  and he may have a good reason for not having what it is you're needing.
[20:19:44] <ryanneufeld> (can't read his mind, so I dunno)
[20:19:44] <d3m0n> Well if he's a jquer dev I am sure it is then
[20:20:09] <ryanneufeld> possibly, only way to find out is to open an issue and ask
[20:20:14] <ryanneufeld> it's free!
[20:21:52] <ryanneufeld> Also, you can use your own custom validator plugins as a workaround for now.
[21:01:07] <|PiP|> lets say i need to make a series of ajax calls, but i want them to execute one after another (in-order). what's the best way to do this?
[21:50:33] <Abhijit> hi
[21:51:40] <Abhijit> when i already have a div and then use uquery to only inject video inside it then jquery can fit video element by getelementbyid. but when div is not there and i insert div using jquery and then insert video inside this div then it appears on html but jquery then can not find video by getelementbyid? how to solve this?
[21:53:08] <Woet> Abhijit: www.jsfiddle.net
[22:03:59] <monk3y> Abhijit: yeah it's best to make us a JSFiddle so we can see exactly what you mean.  It's confusing that you're saying 'jQuery', but also using getElementById.  Why not just $("#elementId").?  If you're dynamically adding-in the div and video, jQuery should be able to find the element with the id after that.  Check the rendered HTML to make sure it's all there.
[22:07:17] <Abhijit> ok
[22:31:27] <DreamStiffler> ok where was i yesterday
[22:31:35] <DreamStiffler> im closer but not just there yet
[22:31:51] <DreamStiffler> im having issue with this append prepend before after
[22:32:41] <DreamStiffler> basically what im trying to do
[22:32:43] <DreamStiffler> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12948853/how-do-i-force-jquery-append-to-not-automatically-close-a-tag
[22:32:54] <DreamStiffler> but there ar emany butts that didnt make it work
[22:32:59] <DreamStiffler> so i end up here
[22:33:04] <DreamStiffler> with this script
[22:37:59] <Max-P> DreamStiffler: The concept of opening/closing tags doesn't exist in the DOM
[22:39:41] <Max-P> The closing tag is just for when you write it in HTML form, when it's parsed into DOM objects. You want to create a tr, a td, append your content to your td, then append your td's to the tr's and finally append the tr's to the table.
[22:41:26] <DreamStiffler> Max-P: thats not mine, didnt quite get what you mean. mine is coming after this.
[22:42:13] <rcyr> DreamStiffler: Every "append" must have a complete and valid chunk of HTML
[22:42:44] <rcyr> $("#list").append('<td><span class="rom">'+g+'</span>\n');  <-- This is not valid because </span> and </td> are not closed.
[22:43:04] <rcyr> Err
[22:43:11] <rcyr> Only the <td>, my bad
[22:43:28] <DreamStiffler> rcyr: so what do i use if not using append
[22:43:50] <DreamStiffler> rcyr: i need to have an open tag. then insert two results before cloing a div
[22:43:53] <rcyr> DreamStiffler: You use the solution given to that SO thread, you build a string
[22:44:18] <rcyr> Then when the string contains "valid" HTML (The whole chunk of HTML is built) you append once.
[22:44:30] <DreamStiffler> rcyr: which come to my issue here. im trying to get my code in fiddle
[22:45:20] <Cork> oh, lovely...
[22:45:36] <Cork> we'll soon have a w3c webkit living standard -_-'
[22:45:52] <rcyr> What?
[22:46:15] <Cork> these properties is about to be standardized https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/173d1p3LkW_LWk-VMnrxGPhTobtKSpED30Fys5ZJLttA/edit#gid=51341101
[22:46:27] <Cork> standardized as in all browsers will implement them
[22:46:57] <rcyr> o_O
[22:47:09] <Cork> freaking idiot mobile web developers...
[22:47:44] <rcyr> If at least anyone was using webkit these days...
[22:47:55] <Cork> rcyr: your using chrome?
[22:48:00] <Cork> or iphone?
[22:48:01] <Max-P> DreamStiffler: http://jsfiddle.net/uc5daro7/
[22:48:06] <Cork> or ipad
[22:48:09] <Cork> or opera
[22:48:11] <rcyr> Cork: Chrome has Blink.
[22:48:19] <rcyr> It's a fork of webkit.
[22:48:26] <Cork> rcyr: but it still implements the prefixes
[22:48:52] <Max-P> Actually, http://jsfiddle.net/uc5daro7/1/ (didn't think of the &#x stuff)
[22:48:53] <Cork> but ya the problem is apples products and the closed ecosystem they have
[22:49:27] <Cork> and not to forget the fact that xcodes documentation tells developers to user prefixed properties, even if they are standardized
[22:49:34] <Cork> ex webkitOpacity
[22:49:44] <Cork> even things like webkitWidth
[22:49:47] <Max-P> Cork: Is that... Microsoft's new browser implementing the vendor prefixed properties??
[22:49:51] <rcyr> :/
[22:50:03] <Cork> Max-P: microsoft and mozilla
[22:50:08] <Cork> AND w3c
[22:50:12] <Cork> it is getting to be a spec
[22:50:18] <rcyr> Cork: Any source for Mozilla and W3C?
[22:50:19] <Max-P> Why T_T
[22:50:21] <Cork> like i said "webkit living standard"
[22:50:38] <Cork> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1170774#c2
[22:50:46] <rcyr> I knew Edge was going to have webkit* properties... didn't know for others.
[22:50:49] <Cork> "I think it's time to define the WebKit-prefix Living Standard, just like mimesniff and quirksmode living standards."
[22:50:58] <Cork> "Anne, how to propose a new Living Standard document?"
[22:51:09] <DreamStiffler> rcyr: http://jsfiddle.net/531La38t/15/
[22:51:18] <DreamStiffler> im looking at yours now
[22:51:33] <Cork> Max-P: cause too many freaking webdevelopers doesn't write browser compatible sites
[22:51:49] <Cork> Max-P: they write apple specific sites and ignore the rest
[22:51:57] <Max-P> Cork: But that's not the browser's problem :/
[22:52:03] <Cork> well apple and google
[22:52:05] <DreamStiffler> rcyr: mine the issue is why is the first "x" div only contains xy1 div. unlike the others. this issue i just. it actually didnt work at local
[22:52:22] <Cork> Max-P: it is, if the result is that user switch browser cause "the pages doesn't render correctly"
[22:52:25] <Cork> and they are
[22:53:02] <rcyr> Cork: LOL, these are the same kind of f...... idiots complaining that if your website doesn't work with JS disabled, you're "breaking the web".
[22:53:03] <Max-P> They should shame the website when those properties are enabled
[22:53:05] <Cork> Max-P: why do you think we have quickmode?
[22:53:20] <Cork> it is to make old ie only websites work in modern browsers
[22:53:31] <Cork> rcyr: ya...
[22:53:38] <rcyr> Making vendor properties "standard"... that's what will break the web.
[22:53:40] <Cork> Max-P: they have been for years
[22:53:50] <Cork> but it is a gigantic wack-a-mole
[22:54:25] <Cork> i've seen the trend here too
[22:54:39] <Cork> where ppl only use the webkit prefixed properties and see that as enough
[22:54:39] <Max-P> Like, a red bar or something that says "This website was designed for XX browser without caring about other browsers. We implemented those functions, but recommend contacting the author of the website about that"
[22:54:46] <Max-P> Surely, after a while, webmasters would fix their shit
[22:54:50] <Cork> Max-P: that doesn't help
[22:55:04] <Cork> the result is "i switch to this browser cause it just works"
[22:55:21] <Cork> it's the same thing as why all browsers implement drm now
[22:55:47] <Cork> heck firefox even download a precompiled binary blob to be able to do it
[22:56:19] <Max-P> *sigh* as if the web wasn't broken enough already :/
[22:56:38] <Max-P> The experimental stuff should never have been available to the public
[22:56:42] <Cork> ya, users don't care, web developers don't care
[22:56:54] <Cork> so... the web gets screwed
[22:56:59] <Max-P> Should have been a switch to enable in the settings, so people don't fucking jump on unfinished unstable features
[22:57:15] <Cork> Max-P: ya, that is the new solution
[22:57:25] <Cork> prefixes isn't used anymore for exactly this reason
[22:57:37] <Max-P> And webkit should kill the prefixes to force the websites to update, while at it
[22:57:49] <Cork> ya, and if they did things would be fine
[22:57:52] <Max-P> It was always clear right from the beginning, if you use one, you must also use the unprefixed version
[22:57:59] <rcyr> Could happen for chrome.... can't see apple doing this
[22:58:00] <Cork> but the statement from apple is "we won't unprefix - ever"
[22:58:32] <Cork> and that is almost an exact quite (taken from memory though)
[22:58:47] <Cork> chrome won't remove the prefixes cause of webcompat
[22:59:34] <Max-P> Chrome really would be in the best position to get balls and do the right thing and kill the prefixed versions
[22:59:52] <Max-P> So many people use Chrome, you bet websites would get fixed ASAP if Chrome suddently killed it
[22:59:57] <rcyr> As long as no new webkit properties are added... it won't "break the web" but still, it's bad.
[23:00:11] <Cork> ya, but even they aren't powerful enough to break webcompat, and they have hisotrically proven they don't care
[23:00:34] <Cork> they stated they where going to drop h264 to push web standard to an open none patented standard - never did
[23:00:46] <rcyr> It was a stupid idea anyway.
[23:00:54] <Cork> they where in with the group of ppl implementing and pushing web drm
[23:01:10] <Cork> so... why have zero history of pushing for a better future web
[23:01:11] <DreamStiffler> i hope someone could help
[23:01:20] <DreamStiffler> im restarting my pc
[23:01:21] <DreamStiffler> brb
[23:01:28] <Cork> opps
[23:01:39] <Cork> * so... they have zero*
[23:02:59] <printForever> jquery question... how to grab input field values just a moment before user closes the tab
[23:03:30] <Cork> printForever: currently you might be able to do it with beforeunload
[23:03:45] <Cork> but that even looks like it might be removed soon
[23:03:56] <printForever> hm... what could replace it?
[23:04:01] <Cork> printForever: the better option is to do the update on input fields input event
[23:04:05] <Cork> printForever: nothing
[23:04:33] <printForever> hm... I'm trying to collect email and name from someone who abandons the form
[23:04:45] <printForever> so, I thought... keypres() or on()
[23:05:03] <printForever> but how can I know if the input values are finale...
[23:05:41] <rcyr> printForever: You "wait" for X milliseconds after the last input.
[23:05:47] <Max-P> printForever: You basically can't, and that's a very good thing. When I close a tab, I close a tab. I expect the page to go away.
[23:06:05] <rcyr> printForever: Such a function is often called "debounce"
[23:06:06] <Max-P> But if you really want, well, everytime the user types something, push it to the server and use a cookie to store a unique ID
[23:06:10] <printForever> rcyr: but what happens if the user closes the window
[23:06:39] <rcyr> printForever:  Could you send the info without waiting for the user to close the window
[23:06:40] <printForever> Max-P, this is not about interrupting the user experience
[23:06:56] <rcyr> printForever: Else, you'll be required to do an ugly sync XHR
[23:07:06] <printForever> rcyr, sure I could, but... then, you're never sure if its the correct value...
[23:07:07] <rcyr> And to use onbeforeunload
[23:07:19] <Max-P> And only Firefox allows XHR in onbeforeunload. Chrome just ignores it
[23:07:32] <printForever> happy times
[23:07:51] <Max-P> Your best bet is really to sync in the background all the time, just like Google Docs uses
[23:08:07] <printForever> right...
[23:08:47] <printForever> hm... or when user leaves the input field
[23:09:11] <printForever> to explain the scenario, its a form, classic form, email, name, surname, phone...
[23:09:30] <printForever> I want to grab email and name, after the user has inputed those values
[23:09:42] <printForever> so I can send him an email reminder, if he has not completed the form
[23:10:08] <rcyr> I'm not a lawyer but is that even legal?
[23:10:08] <rcyr> :)
[23:10:13] <rcyr> Anyway :P
[23:10:19] <printForever> conversion rate in those cases goes up to 40%
[23:10:24] <printForever> yup, it is
[23:10:39] <printForever> like when you fill out a form but dont submit
[23:10:45] <printForever> the data is still on the form
[23:10:51] <rcyr> Right
[23:10:52] <Max-P> $('#email-field').on('input', function() { $.post('/annoy-the-user', { data: $(this).val() }); });
[23:11:09] <Cork> printForever: $(document).on('input', ':input', function() { locaStorage.setItem(this.name, $(this.val()); });
[23:11:10] <rcyr> Max-P: That would unecessarily flood the server
[23:11:14] <Cork> that's all you need
[23:11:20] <printForever> :))) Cork and Max-P, I know what to do :)
[23:11:27] <printForever> I'm just asking about the principle
[23:11:34] <printForever> am I right to assume etc.
[23:11:58] <Cork> printForever: the solution i showed you is what they recommend as a replacement for beforeUnload
[23:12:09] <printForever> thank you I will test it now
[23:12:10] <Max-P> rcyr: That server totally deserves to get hammered for such a shady thing ;p
[23:12:16] <rcyr> Hehe
[23:12:17] <printForever> btw. Cork, whats :input??
[23:12:24] <Cork> ?api :input
[23:12:24] <b-ot> Cork: :input Selector: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[23:12:50] <Cork> on('input') catches the input event
[23:12:53] <Cork> it is NOT a selector
[23:12:57] <printForever> ouh, I never target them like that
[23:13:03] <printForever> right
[23:13:13] <printForever> well, you learn a new thing each day
[23:13:36] <Cork> one shouldn't use keyup/keydown cause they miss a lot of cases
[23:13:43] <Cork> that the input even catches
[23:13:54] <Cork> *event
[23:25:26] <printForever> Cork, since I'm using :input first time... can I add css ID or CLASS in front of :input so that it would catch all input fields inside that particular ID or CLASS?
[23:25:50] <Cork> printForever: it works like a normal selector
[23:25:54] <Cork> so yes
[23:26:01] <printForever> oh, thanks
[23:26:13] <Cork> '#id:input' (doesn't really make sense though)
[23:26:21] <printForever> for me :input reminds me of pseudo class
[23:26:21] <Cork> or '#id :input'
[23:26:42] <Cork> or ':input:valid'
[23:26:43] <printForever> when you have 2 or more input forms on the page, I hope it helps
[23:26:52] <Cork> printForever: it is a psudo class
[23:27:01] <Cork> :input => *:input
[23:27:08] <printForever> aaaaaw... now I get it
[23:27:11] <Cork> it is a psudo class implemented by jquery though
[23:27:18] <printForever> right on
[23:28:20] <printForever> I had a problem recently
[23:28:27] <printForever> trying to target id with a colon
[23:28:39] <printForever> id="email:billing"
[23:28:49] <Cork> '#email\\:billing'
[23:28:51] <printForever> I tried escaping the : but it didnt work
[23:28:54] <printForever> yeah, I did that
[23:28:57] <printForever> didnt work
[23:29:00] <Cork> (stupid iss)
[23:29:03] <Cork> itdoes
[23:29:05] <Cork> *it does
[23:29:21] <printForever> well I got error in the Console
[23:29:33] <printForever> that the selector was bad
[23:30:02] <printForever> I even tried "#email'\:billing'"
[23:30:09] <Cork> printForever: http://jsfiddle.net/sfL3x30y/
[23:30:13] <printForever> many different variations and nothing
[23:30:16] <Cork> note the \\ not \
[23:30:28] <Cork> \: will be converted to : by the parser
[23:30:29] <printForever> yeah, I had double, triple, quadruple backslashes
[23:30:30] <printForever> nothing
[23:30:36] <Cork> check the link
[23:30:48] <printForever> I did
[23:30:49] <printForever> it fired
[23:30:51] <printForever> ...
[23:30:57] <printForever> damn it
[23:33:18] <Cork> printForever: i wrote this one as a horror example a while back http://jsfiddle.net/w3qRm/2/
[23:33:43] <printForever> oh the horror! oh the humanity!
[23:34:20] <Cork> it really shows how much css doesn't care what you have in the selectors :)
[23:43:22] <printForever> this is what I wrote
[23:43:22] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/Uf3aP5Sa
[23:43:46] <Cork> printForever: don't put element tag names infront of ids
[23:43:50] <printForever> first, I declare variables, then I check for the two...
[23:44:03] <Cork> the id is already unique, no need for first filter it on tag name
[23:44:04] <printForever> I know its not a good practice, I'm fully aware :(
[23:44:29] <printForever> but I want to get it working, and when I get it working with the element tag, I will remove it, to see if it works with just the ID
[23:44:55] <Cork> printForever: could you create a jsfiddle with the js and the matching html?
[23:45:09] <Cork> pastebin is kinda sucky as one can't run the code
[23:45:16] <printForever> ouh...
[23:45:50] <printForever> I know I got product_name and product_image correct
[23:45:53] <printForever> because they are static
[23:46:12] <printForever> but I'm not sure if I reused your script correctly
[23:46:37] <printForever> btw. I screwed up line 9 and 10 (wrong names)
[23:49:01] <sopparus> can I do like this somehow,        $("table" ).attr("id", "02").addClass("highlight"); as is, only highlight where <tr data-id"02"> ?
[23:49:19] <sopparus> or how would I do it
[23:49:38] <rcyr> $('[data-id="02"]').addClass('highlight');
[23:50:24] <Cork> sopparus: attr('id') doesn't modify data-id
[23:50:35] <Cork> sopparus: attr('data-id') does
[23:51:23] <printForever> Uncaught ReferenceError: locaStorage is not defined
[23:51:32] <Cork> an l is missing
[23:51:37] <Cork> locallStorage
[23:51:38] <printForever> crap
