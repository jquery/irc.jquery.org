[00:00:14] <SirLagz> Cork: for some reason, i remembered that for something else, but not this lol.
[00:00:29] <Cork> or $.Callback
[00:01:03] <SirLagz> Cork: thanks

[01:17:39] <simi> Hello guys. I have only jQuery (1.11.1) loaded on my page and running in anonymous mode. When I type "$.ajax(window.location.href)" in console and I hit ctrl+u (show source code in Chrome), I'm getting source of that ajax call (I'm sending another layout on server for xhr calls). This also brokes back button.
[01:18:18] <Cork> anonymous mode?
[01:18:37] <simi> clean broser without extensions to ensure it is not problem with my env.
[01:18:40] <simi> browser
[01:19:01] <Cork> ah
[01:19:14] <simi> https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en
[01:19:21] <Cork> i know what mode it is
[01:19:33] <Cork> it sounded like you where talking about a jquery mode
[01:19:57] <Cork> simi: so what is the question?
[01:20:06] <simi> Why is that happening?
[01:20:13] <Cork> why is what happending?
[01:20:26] <Cork> why you can see the source code?
[01:20:47] <simi> sorry
[01:20:51] <simi> probably not described well
[01:20:54] <simi> I'll try again
[01:21:10] <simi> 1. I open http://localhost:3000/
[01:21:25] <simi> 2. in browser JS console i run "$.ajax(window.location.href)"
[01:21:31] <simi> 3. click on any link on page
[01:21:35] <simi> 4. click back button
[01:21:52] <simi> 5. instead of http://localhost:3000/ I see result of previous ajax call
[01:22:08] <simi> localhost:3000 renders different for html and xhr request
[01:22:16] <Cork> is the server handling the ajax call differently then none ajax calls?
[01:22:21] <Cork> else you will have problems with $.ajax(window.location.href)
[01:22:21] <simi> yes
[01:22:37] <simi> it renders without layout for xhr calls (no html and body, ...)
[01:22:40] <Cork> and you're using pushState to store the session?
[01:22:52] <Cork> or how are you populating the history?
[01:23:02] <simi> I'm not since I'm not changing DOM.
[01:23:11] <simi> I just run that ajax call. I'm not rendering it into DOM.
[01:23:16] <Cork> then you shouldn't have a history back at all
[01:23:31] <Cork> cause $.ajax() doens't cause a browsing history step to be created
[01:23:54] <Cork> so back if anything would bring you to step 0
[01:25:08] <simi> hmm, I'm not getting it :(
[01:25:40] <simi> I'm sending ajax call but I'm not modifying anything in the DOM. Why should I care about history pushState?
[01:26:23] <simi> Actually it looks like it is creating browser history step with that ajax result for me.
[01:26:31] <simi> And that is what I want to prevent.
[01:27:19] <Cork> simi: that is what i talked about $.ajax() don't create history
[01:27:25] <Cork> you would have to have code that does
[01:27:29] <Cork> like .pushState()
[01:27:42] <simi> The weird part is that I have not :(
[01:27:53] <Cork> then you might have found a chrome bug
[01:27:54] <simi> *probably I have*
[01:28:02] <simi> hmm, I can try to test FF
[01:28:04] <simi> thanks for idea
[01:28:40] <Cork> but normally no browser (except some versions of opera) create browser history for ajax calls
[01:28:54] <Cork> some OLD versions of opera
[01:29:23] <simi> hmm, it works in FF
[01:29:57] <simi> The weird part is I can't reproduce it outside my project (private). So I can't prepare any demo for that.
[01:30:35] <Cork> make a grep through the source tree for pushState
[01:30:44] <Cork> you most likely have something like it somewhere
[01:30:53] <Cork> as that is the only command i know of that can do this
[01:31:14] <sacho> are you sure you're not assigning to window.location(.href)?
[01:31:56] <sacho> why are you running $.ajax(window.location.href) anyway?
[01:32:25] <simi> Only jQuery script is loaded (checked via chrome dev tools in 'Sources' tab).
[01:32:34] <sacho> hm, for some reason I remembered incorrectly the parameters for $.ajax
[01:32:37] <simi> And there is not inline javascript in source code.
[01:32:39] <sacho> so disregard that last question
[01:32:56] <simi> And it works in FF.
[01:33:00] <Cork> sacho: you're prob remembering the old (still valid) syntax
[01:33:09] <Cork> $.ajax({ url: })
[01:33:14] <simi> I can try that.
[01:33:24] <Cork> simi: it shouldn't matter
[01:33:37] <Cork> $.ajax({ url: url }) is identical to $.ajax(url)
[01:33:37] <simi> I'm lost so I can try everything :)
[01:33:55] <sacho> what do you mean "I see the result of the previous ajax call" anyway?
[01:33:57] <simi> I'm going to see if I can inspect browser history states.
[01:34:11] <simi> It renders result of that $.ajax call when back button is pushed.
[01:34:52] <Cork> meaning you get a history state without any dom updates
[01:35:09] <Cork> something that again sounds like a perfect description of what pushState would do
[01:35:17] <sacho> anooying
[01:35:21] <Cork> (if you don't have an event handler for it)
[01:35:36] <Cork> *event handler for popstate
[01:35:45] <simi> there's only onpopstate ?
[01:35:49] <simi> not onpushstate
[01:35:54] <Cork> ya
[01:36:02] <Cork> pushState is a method
[01:36:09] <Cork> you call it to create a history entry
[01:36:14] <Cork> there is also replaceState
[01:38:27] <simi> I tried to replace pushState and replaceState, but they are not called.
[01:38:27] <simi> :(
[01:38:36] <Cork> simi: so you are calling pushState?
[01:38:46] <simi> nope
[01:38:46] <Cork> you said you didn't
[01:38:50] <simi> just for debug
[01:38:51] <simi> http://felix-kling.de/blog/2011/01/06/how-to-detect-history-pushstate/
[01:39:23] <simi> only jquery is loaded via script tag and I run "$.ajax(window.location.href)" manually in browser console.
[01:39:27] <Cork> simi: you should start reducing the site to find where the problem comes from
[01:39:28] <sacho> simi, what happens if you press the back button without doing $.ajax() in the scenario you described earlier?
[01:39:37] <simi> it works as expected
[01:39:50] <Cork> cause this is not normal behavior
[01:40:05] <Cork> so you must either have found a bug in chrome (as it only happens there)
[01:40:13] <simi> I try to reduce rendered html to minimum.
[01:40:17] <Cork> or you're doing something funky in the code (this most likely is true either way)
[01:40:21] <sacho> simi, there's no other code running besides jquery 1.11?
[01:40:25] <simi> nope
[01:40:59] <simi> I'll try to isolate this bug.
[01:41:01] <simi> give me a sec
[01:41:05] <simi> if you're interested
[01:41:12] <simi> but since it works in FF it is not jQuery bug probably
[01:41:39] <Cork> simi: it's most likely a bug in your site code
[01:41:53] <Cork> cause i've never seen chrome do this
[01:42:00] <simi> yup, that's why I'm trying to isolate my code so I can make it public
[02:01:31] <FilipNortic> should clickevents fire from a div where the  $("#divId").prop( "disabled") returns true?
[02:01:47] <Cork> FilipNortic: div can't have disabled
[02:01:59] <Cork> disabled is only valid on form elements
[02:02:11] <simi> ok I have it isolated
[02:02:56] <Cork> FilipNortic: if you set disabled on a div you're creating a user variable on the dom element that might conflict with future specs, that is all
[02:03:31] <FilipNortic> ah right I usally go around it by setting a data-disabled attriburte. been a while since I had to do front end so I keep forgetting
[02:03:53] <Cork> FilipNortic: might be better to set a class in those cases
[02:04:11] <Cork> as that is mainly what you want
[02:06:06] <FilipNortic> well I can see the advantages of using a class (and i think we might have had this discussion before) but it easier to notice a data attriburte
[02:08:53] <simi> Cork, sacho : https://ajax-history.herokuapp.com/
[02:08:55] <simi> you can try there
[02:08:59] <FilipNortic> But shouldn't trying to access the property fail if you can't set it? Or is it the attribute that can't be set?
[02:11:10] <sacho> simi, I don't see the problem in my chrome version
[02:11:56] <sacho> ah ok, it's a specific of incognito mode.
[02:13:18] <simi> reproducable in normal mode also
[02:13:35] <simi> I'm using incognito mode just to ensure it is not caused by extensions.
[02:14:18] <sacho> eh, in normal mode, I didn't get the problem
[02:14:30] <sacho> my guess is that loading the same page is changing the cache for it
[02:14:36] <simi> sacho, what's your system?
[02:14:44] <simi> You mean in browser?
[02:15:02] <sacho> so for example, to solve your proble, you could add a timestamp
[02:15:12] <simi> yup
[02:15:14] <simi> I tested it also.
[02:15:22] <simi> damn, that unexpected behavior for me
[02:15:24] <simi> but thanks sacho!
[02:15:31] <simi> you're my hero
[02:15:37] <sacho> I don't know if it's really reported as a bug to chrome yet
[02:15:41] <sacho> or if they even consider it a bug
[02:16:49] <simi> looks like a "feature"
[02:17:30] <Cork> simi: could you make the site use an uncompressed version of jquery?
[02:17:35] <simi> yes
[02:17:38] <Cork> like code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[02:18:56] <Colmea> Hey guys. I'm wondering: why does .submit() doesn't call HTML5 validation ? And is there a workaround ?
[02:19:19] <Colmea> hum sorry for my bad english -_-
[02:19:29] <Cork> Colmea: .submit() isn't calling the native submit directly
[02:19:59] <Cork> as .submit() on the dom element cause a lot of special behaviors (like actually submitting the form)
[02:20:09] <Cork> and some of them can't be aborted
[02:20:13] <Colmea> Cork: I understand, but why not manually calling native html5 validation then ?
[02:20:14] <Colmea> ok
[02:20:40] <Cork> Colmea: that most likely falls into the realm of a plugin
[02:21:00] <Colmea> Ok. Then, is there a way to call this html5 validation ? :p
[02:21:15] <simi> Cork, it is ready
[02:21:26] <Cork> Colmea: you can ask if a field is valid
[02:21:37] <Cork> you would have to write the glue you're self
[02:22:00] <Colmea> Cork: mhh yes, But I would like to call the native validation.
[02:22:37] <Colmea> I guess I have to trigger a fake click on the original submit button then
[02:22:43] <Cork> simi: AH, i know what it is
[02:22:49] <Cork> and it is actually expected
[02:23:02] <Cork> simi: when you call $.ajax(window.location.href) you make a new call to the server
[02:23:09] <Cork> and this response is updating the local cache
[02:23:19] <Cork> when you later move back to the page the updated cache is used
[02:23:25] <simi> What you recommend? Maybe return another content-type?
[02:23:31] <simi> to prevent this?
[02:23:33] <Cork> don't use $.ajax(window.location.href)
[02:23:42] <simi> $.get?
[02:23:44] <simi> or?
[02:23:54] <Cork> use a different path
[02:24:09] <simi> I would like to prevent timestamp in url.
[02:24:17] <Cork> like $.ajax('/section')
[02:24:20] <simi> Do you have any idea what should break the caching?
[02:24:28] <simi> some header or similar?
[02:24:32] <Cork> simi: your replacing the cache
[02:24:42] <Cork> the url match the same cache entry
[02:25:07] <sacho> simi, you could add some nocache response headers
[02:25:12] <Cork> and this is something you should avoid
[02:25:32] <Cork> but that would mean any navigation change would send a request to the server
[02:25:39] <Cork> so again, you should avoid this
[02:26:05] <simi> I can do that only for this particular same url responses.
[02:26:07] <simi> let's chcek
[02:26:09] <simi> let's check it
[02:27:58] <simi> it works with no-cache headers
[02:28:02] <simi> thanks again guys!
[02:29:48] <simi> Any chance I can help you also in any way sacho and Cork?
[02:30:17] <Cork> simi: heh, don't think so, but thx for asking ^^
[02:32:07] <simi> at least I can follow you on twitter if you have
[02:32:14] <simi> or on github
[02:33:56] <Uhkis> lol
[02:53:33] <simi> actually $.ajax({cache: false}) is enough also
[02:54:43] <ravenzz> I have some simple logic to catch clicks outside a modal dialog (click on the overlay/outer element) to close it.
[02:55:13] <ravenzz> something like this http://jsfiddle.net/5azm25ag/
[02:55:34] <ravenzz> problem is that I also have js-nav that replaces .inner
[02:55:55] <ravenzz> what is happening there is that the event handler can't find .inner and closes the modal
[02:56:15] <ravenzz> so I added this condition !$.contains(document.documentElement, event.target)
[02:56:29] <ravenzz> is there a better way to fix it?
[03:25:27] <Cork> simi: cache: false adds a timestamp to the url though
[03:25:41] <Cork> simi: that is explicitly what that option does
[03:25:49] <simi> that's the spirit
[03:26:22] <simi> I was afraid to just concat current url with '?timestamp=x' since there should be some parameter already and I should use & instead.
[03:26:28] <simi> ^ introducing new "logic"
[03:26:36] <simi> so that solved my problem
[03:26:50] <Cork> ravenzz: don't ever kill events like that
[03:27:13] <Cork> ravenzz: bind a click handler on the document element and check if it is from inside the wrapper
[03:27:21] <Cork> and it if is, ignore it, else close it
[03:28:00] <Cork> simi: but why use the same url for different data
[03:28:08] <Cork> as they obviously isn't the same
[03:28:11] <simi> data are same
[03:28:18] <Cork> no it isn't
[03:28:19] <simi> but they are missing layout for xhr
[03:28:26] <Cork> that is why you have the problem you currently have
[03:28:28] <simi> I know
[03:28:58] <simi> there's no layout for xhr requests sent back
[03:29:01] <Cork> what you should do is separate them into unique urls
[03:29:12] <simi> this is universal solution for whole project
[03:29:13] <Cork> as that is what they are
[03:29:36] <simi> it is using https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom to rerender only minimal changes
[03:29:37] <Cork> simi: an alternative could be to json encode the content for the ajax call so they get different content type
[03:30:13] <simi> I'm getting HTML from server, creating a minimal set of patches and applying those patches to current DOM
[03:30:27] <Cork> but ya, you're breaking the http standard and have problem as a consequence
[03:30:42] <simi> which one?
[03:31:04] <simi> since the request is sent with different HTTP header, should I expect it will return same response?
[03:32:08] <simi> X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
[03:32:28] <simi> I think it is different request, so there can be different response.
[03:32:35] <simi> And it should not be replaced in cache.
[03:32:44] <Cork> cache is only based on url and content-type
[03:32:57] <Cork> and if you have the same url and the same content type the data should be the same
[03:33:54] <simi> ok, so do you think it is good idea to introduce own vendored content-type?
[03:34:04] <simi> application/vnd.project-name
[03:35:30] <simi> since it is not text/html
[03:35:35] <simi> but kind of custom xml
[03:37:07] <Cork> no
[03:37:23] <Cork> like i said, if you absolutely have to use the same url
[03:37:29] <Cork> json encode the html response
[03:37:45] <Cork> something like { html:"<string>" }
[03:37:57] <Cork> and use the application/json content-type
[03:38:06] <Cork> else use a different url
[03:38:24] <Cork> as you aren't sending a stateless http response if you don't
[03:39:20] <simi> And what is difference between custom content-type with custom content (some xml) and json content type with some json with my custom content wrapped in JS string?
[03:39:44] <simi> It is JSON aware for now, since it works with XML/DOM only.
[03:39:59] <simi> unaware
[03:40:13] <Cork> simi: cause you shouldn't lie in the content-type
[03:40:28] <simi> I'm not lying. It is my custom format based on XML.
[03:40:42] <Cork> but it is html, so yes you are
[03:41:15] <simi> it is not valid html
[03:41:15] <Cork> inventing a file format to get around a cache or to be able to abuse the url schema is the wrong reason
[03:41:17] <sacho> simi, the custom content-type sounds ok
[03:41:34] <sacho> assuming you always return the same contents/content-type on an xhr
[03:41:39] <simi> is is just multiple section tags with custom html inside
[03:41:42] <simi> no html or head or body tag
[03:41:50] <sacho> but why couldn't you just use another url?
[03:42:01] <Cork> simi: yes, also known as an html partial
[03:42:14] <simi> because this is drop-in solution and it can work for every page in project
[03:42:42] <simi> for another url I should introduce new url (or prefix) for every possible url that can use it
[03:42:55] <sacho> a prefix sounds like a good solution
[03:43:00] <sacho> xhr-templates/...
[03:43:02] <Cork> simi: something you should do if they don't return the same response
[03:43:25] <simi> those are not templates, that's the problem
[03:43:33] <sacho> ok, whatever they are.
[03:43:38] <sacho> xhr-whatever.
[03:44:09] <simi> ok, so now I have about 100 routes and I should add another 100 just prefixed with xhr-* ?
[03:44:13] <simi> I think that is not good idea.
[03:44:42] <Cork> it sounds like your basing it on rails, so again just use the json type
[03:44:50] <simi> that will be better to introduce whole subdomain for that
[03:44:54] <Cork> then you don't need extra routes and things will just work
[03:45:37] <Cork> an option could be to just set a param value and use that
[03:46:01] <simi> But then I think it is equal to use custom content type, since I will be lying about content.
[03:46:09] <Cork> as for the url part of it it doesn't care if you use /something/ or ?section=something
[03:46:12] <simi> for json content type
[03:46:33] <Cork> simi: if you use json you would json encode the response of course
[03:46:45] <ravenzz> Cork: how would that change the fact that .inner is replaced and therefore its length may be 0 ?
[03:47:36] <Cork> ravenzz: it would base it on .wrapper not inner
[03:47:46] <ravenzz> Cork: how?
[03:48:05] <ravenzz> $('document').on('click', '.wrapper') ?
[03:48:17] <simi> sure, but I think that's waste of time to encode json on server and decode json on client when I don't need JSON
[03:48:24] <simi> But I understand your arguments guys.
[03:48:28] <simi> I'll rethink that.
[03:48:31] <simi> thanks a lot
[03:48:33] <simi> for feedback
[03:49:48] <Cork> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/5azm25ag/1/
[03:50:36] <Uhkis> Cork and his infamous typos strike again
[03:50:58] <Cork> typo?
[03:51:20] <Uhkis> ducment is not defined ;-)
[03:51:25] <Cork> GAH
[03:51:37] <Cork> didn't even see that
[03:51:41] <Cork> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/5azm25ag/2/
[03:52:04] <ravenzz> haha np
[03:52:07] <ravenzz> let me check that
[03:52:39] <ravenzz> I was a bit afraid of the overhead
[03:52:49] <ravenzz> I should probably unbind on close
[03:52:54] <ravenzz> if I go down that road
[03:52:54] <Cork> yes
[03:53:08] <Cork> it shouldn't be that much of an overhead though
[03:53:21] <Cork> as it basically just fire once per click
[03:53:29] <Cork> and only check node.parentNode chain
[03:53:52] <Cork> and this is pretty much how delegate works
[03:53:56] <Cork> (but the other way around)
[03:54:02] <ravenzz> yeah
[03:58:52] <Zitter> hi, how to get <li data-key="myKey"> in jQuery? I'm looking at data() method but I cannot understand how to do that
[04:01:02] <Uhkis> $('li').data('key');
[04:02:43] <Zitter> Uhkis, thanks a lot
[04:04:01] <ravenzz> Cork: can you think of any other way to do that? I only have beforeShow hooks
[04:04:21] <ravenzz> Cork: maybe I can check if the modal is visible too?
[04:11:45] <Cork> ravenzz: the handler on $(document) is the cleanest solution i can think of
[04:12:15] <ravenzz> yeah, I mean that's how I've always done this.. I'll see if I can find a way around that issue
[04:12:39] <Cork> ravenzz: you could put a cover screen over the page as you show the dialog
[04:12:46] <Cork> and just have a click handler on it
[04:12:59] <Cork> then you would only have to have a simple click handler (as it isn't a parent)
[04:13:38] <ravenzz> Cork: I am refactoring this component to remove a lot of useless code, and the cover is one of them imo
[04:13:38] <ravenzz> :)
[04:14:08] <Cork> ravenzz: just remember that you have a risk of someone clicking a link to close the dialog if you do
[04:14:24] <Cork> i personally normally use a coverscreen for that exact reason
[04:14:54] <Cork> (someone clicking the destroy action button to close the info dialog *woops*)
[04:15:14] <ravenzz> what do you mean?
[04:15:26] <ravenzz> something which is not inside the modal?
[04:15:27] <Cork> click bubble from the target element down
[04:15:29] <ravenzz> but a sibling
[04:15:30] <Cork> yes
[04:15:32] <ravenzz> elem
[04:15:35] <ravenzz> oh yeah
[04:15:37] <Cork> or anywhere else on the page
[04:15:43] <ravenzz> sure
[04:15:52] <ravenzz> that's why I wanted to bind on the modal
[04:16:00] <Cork> that won't help there
[04:16:03] <ravenzz> and catch clicks coming from the inside
[04:16:06] <Cork> as the event isn't in the dialog
[04:16:07] <ravenzz> it would
[04:16:19] <Cork> so you want to close the dialog if you click IN the dialog?
[04:16:34] <ravenzz> if I click in the Outer wrapper
[04:16:41] <ravenzz> the inner one is the actual dialog
[04:16:43] <Cork> and what if the click is outside?
[04:16:52] <ravenzz> outside what? the wrapper?
[04:17:02] <Cork> ah you move the cover to a wrapper
[04:17:06] <ravenzz> yeah
[04:17:08] <ravenzz> :)
[04:17:16] <Cork> not always a good idea for said reason
[04:17:20] <ravenzz> the wrapper is the "overlay" and the dialog is inside
[04:17:31] <ravenzz> that make sense to me
[04:18:09] <Cork> well then there is another option
[04:18:38] <Cork> if(event.target == this) { $(this).hide(); }
[04:18:54] <Cork> that should do exactly what you want
[04:18:58] <ravenzz> mm where this is? I mean where do I bind?
[04:19:04] <ravenzz> the modal (outer)
[04:19:04] <ravenzz> ?
[04:19:09] <Cork> in the .wrapper click handler
[04:19:13] <ravenzz> yeah
[04:19:57] <Cork> so http://jsfiddle.net/5azm25ag/3/
[04:20:39] <Cork> but why do you have the wrapper AND outer?
[04:22:29] <ravenzz> Cork: I dont :)
[04:22:47] <ravenzz> I was in a hurry when I made the testcase
[04:22:57] <ravenzz> I only have outer and inner
[04:23:04] <Cork> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/5azm25ag/4/
[04:26:45] <ravenzz> Cork: yeah let me see why it doesn't work here
[04:27:13] <Cork> ravenzz: most most likely cause the cover screen isn't the one you bind the event handle on
[04:27:14] <ravenzz> oh because on my framework this is something else
[04:27:27] <ravenzz> would event.target == event.currentTarget
[04:27:29] <ravenzz> work?
[04:27:31] <ravenzz> it shoudl..
[04:27:53] <Cork> it shouldn't be needed
[04:27:58] <Cork> as this is the same thing
[04:28:19] <ravenzz> Cork: the context for that callback is different so this is not the DOM element
[04:28:26] <Cork> unless you do something like .bind(somethingElse) on the function you pass to the event handler
[04:28:33] <ravenzz> exactly
[04:28:35] <ravenzz> :)
[04:28:40] <Cork> (and that is a bad idea...)
[04:29:28] <ravenzz> Cork: I know, but I have to... otherwise I cannot reference the component methods
[04:29:32] <ravenzz> eg. this.close()
[04:29:35] <ravenzz> or hide
[04:29:37] <ravenzz> whathever
[04:29:47] <Cork> you can store them in the data reference
[04:30:01] <ravenzz> mh
[04:30:03] <Cork> and do event.data.something.close()
[04:30:28] <Cork> or store them as .data() on the element
[04:30:34] <ravenzz> yeah, but people would complain in code review :)
[04:30:37] <Cork> depending on if you need to keep them separate there
[04:30:58] <Cork> ravenzz: breaking the standard should cause more uproar
[04:31:06] <ravenzz> Cork: not always
[04:31:14] <Cork> as this is normally always the element the event is about
[04:31:20] <Cork> even in native event handlers
[04:31:23] <ravenzz> once I was asked to "simplify" a simple module pattern
[04:31:35] <ravenzz> because it could be confusing
[04:32:16] <ravenzz> anyway that's another story, e.target == e.currentTarget works
[04:32:16] <Cork> ravenzz: what is confusing about $().on('click', { theClass: this }, function(event) { event.data.theClass.close(); }) ?
[04:32:19] <ravenzz> and it is a good compromise
[04:32:34] <ravenzz> Cork: don't ask me, I am not confused :)
[04:32:48] <ravenzz> it is just a different style/not a common practice here
[04:32:50] <Cork> i find replacing the this value to be much more risk of confusion
[04:33:08] <ravenzz> Cork: people is familiar with that at this point
[04:33:16] <ravenzz> and they always use e.currentTarget
[04:33:21] <ravenzz> instead of this
[04:33:40] <ravenzz> Cork: I agree with you though
[04:33:44] <ravenzz> thanks for the help
[04:33:47] <Cork> np
[04:35:41] <ravenzz> Cork: I guess that at this point it is fine to keep the event handler when I hide the modal right?
[04:35:49] <ravenzz> it is bound on the modal itself
[04:35:59] <ravenzz> ie. don't need to .off it
[04:40:45] <Cork> ravenzz: ya
[05:36:25] <MikeD_> if(mysections.length == mysections.filter('.collapse').length){ /* everything is collapsed */ }  <-- is this best way to accomplish this?
[05:43:25] <Cork> MikeD_: if(mysections.not('.collapse').length > 0) {}
[05:49:32] <MikeD_> is that better or just different?
[05:50:26] <MikeD_> i'm still learning jquery and am curious if one way is any more or less 'right'
[05:51:19] <Cork> MikeD_: less code and shorter lines
[05:51:24] <Cork> so easier to read
[05:51:31] <Superhans> Hi.. Im trying to get the height of a certain element, and set that height on another element. http://jsfiddle.net/h067j91w/   . Problem is that the height i get from that request is not equal to the actual height of the element. I guess its running to early? If i run $('.primary').outerHeight(); directly in my console later on, i get another (higher) value. Thats the one i want to retrive from my function aswell. Any ideas ho
[05:51:31] <Superhans> w a good way to solve this?
[05:51:49] <Cork> MikeD_: but it is basically the same thing, it just does it in reverse
[05:52:03] <MikeD_> understood, thanks.
[05:52:24] <Cork> MikeD_: the revers means you can skip the check of the size of the original array
[05:52:34] <Cork> and that mainly means shorter lines
[05:52:43] <Cork> but it is a tiny speed difference
[05:52:51] <Cork> (microscopic even)
[05:53:49] <Cork> Superhans: does .primary contain images or similar?
[05:54:05] <Superhans> Cork: Yea
[05:54:08] <MikeD_> right, I already had the collection so the .length isn't costing much... but reading it once more already cost me thousands of runtime performance difference, so yeah... compare with 0 is "better" :)
[05:54:10] <Cork> then there is you're problem
[05:54:18] <Superhans> Aha
[05:54:25] <Cork> Superhans: you want the .load event
[05:54:39] <Cork> it is explicitly for "when external media is loaded"
[05:55:32] <Superhans> Ahh cool , thanks!
[05:55:57] <Cork> well it is actually for "when everything on the page is loaded"
[05:56:13] <Cork> but as the page is rendered and done when you get .ready the only thing left is external
[05:56:45] <Superhans> Makes sense and exactly what i was looking for
[05:57:18] <Cork> ... PARSED and done
[05:57:22] <Cork> not rendered >_<'
[05:57:24] <Cork> bit difference
[05:57:28] <MikeD_> does the resize event get fired when external media shows up?
[05:57:28] <Cork> *big
[05:57:41] <Cork> no
[05:57:51] <Cork> resize is fired when the window size has changed
[05:57:55] <Cork> not when the document changes size
[05:59:28] <DevAntoine> hi
[05:59:32] <bbclover> Hey guys, I'm trying to select a parent element with class say .a which has a child somewhere below with class .b. I tried $('.a .b.') but that select the child with class .b it seems
[05:59:42] <DevAntoine> I've got an issue with form serializing: the clicked submit's button name ain't sent
[06:00:08] <Cork> bbclover: $('.a .b').closest('.a')
[06:00:33] <Cork> bbclover: css doesn't do reverse selection
[06:00:51] <bbclover> idk what that means
[06:01:01] <Cork> DevAntoine: yes, js doesn't have a way to get to that info from the form
[06:01:16] <Cork> bbclover: select .b that is a child of .a
[06:01:27] <bbclover> oh...
[06:01:27] <Cork> and then from those elements select the closest .a element
[06:01:36] <bbclover> I get it, thanks
[06:01:42] <bbclover> so .a .b selects the child
[06:01:47] <Cork> yes
[06:01:54] <Cork> always
[06:01:54] <DevAntoine> Cork: so, what's the best way to send the clicked button?
[06:02:05] <Cork> DevAntoine: there is a few options
[06:02:46] <Cork> i usually bind a delegated click handler on the form $('form').on('click', 'button, input[type="submit"]', function() { $(this).closest('form').data('button', this); })
[06:03:08] <Cork> DevAntoine: as that doesn't risk sticking around on a reload and things like that
[06:03:14] <brokenshakles> O/
[06:03:23] <Cork> ~~~\o
[06:03:42] <maxvi> jquery ajax doesn't work in ie 9 for me how can I fix it?
[06:03:48] <brokenshakles> Does anyone know why jquery.js will not detect/load my external .js?
[06:03:56] <Cork> maxvi: your using cors?
[06:04:15] <Cork> ?paste @ brokenshakles
[06:04:15] <b-ot> brokenshakles: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:04:40] <DevAntoine> Cork: and then you get the data value when serializing the form or it does that automaticaly?
[06:04:54] <Cork> DevAntoine: no you would have to append that manually
[06:05:04] <maxvi> Cork: what is cors ? I use jQuery v1.7.1
[06:05:17] <Cork> maxvi: cross domain headers to allow cross domain ajax call
[06:05:25] <Cork> ?g mdn cors
[06:05:26] <b-ot> Cork: HTTP access control (CORS) - HTTP | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[06:06:15] <Cork> maxvi: basically ie9 and older doesn't do cors
[06:06:33] <Cork> so if you need ie9 you would have to avoid cors
[06:07:01] <maxvi> Cork: can I use some library to fix it and use ajax in ie 9 ?
[06:07:06] <Cork> no
[06:07:16] <Cork> you CAN use XDomain
[06:07:29] <Cork> but that need special code server side to support it
[06:07:40] <Cork> as it isn't www-form-encoded and so on
[06:08:08] <Cork> (basically not worth the hassle)
[06:08:44] <Cork> maxvi: if you need to have multiple servers, and need ie9 use a reverse proxy infront of them and let it put them into sub directories instead
[06:08:56] <Cork> much MUCH less hassle then XDomain
[06:09:13] <Cork> (and much less security risks)
[06:09:53] <maxvi> Cork: if I will use the same domain ajax will work in ie9 ? so I can use some php script to get result from another domain
[06:10:07] <Cork> yes
[06:10:18] <Cork> as long as the domain name and port is the same
[06:10:22] <Cork> (including http and https)
[06:10:39] <brokenshakles> http://jsbin.com/xizuyabure/1/edit?html,css,js
[06:10:50] <maxvi> Cork: thanks will do that!
[06:11:08] <MikeD_> maxvi: consider how I can grief your proxy
[06:11:44] <MikeD_> grief/abuse/use for my own reason
[06:11:45] <Cork> brokenshakles: uh, you're not loading any js
[06:12:00] <brokenshakles> Oh?
[06:12:04] <brokenshakles> why not?
[06:12:14] <Cork> you push history nothing else
[06:12:34] <brokenshakles> Still, it doesnt work
[06:12:58] <Cork> also the push is just normal js
[06:13:00] <Cork> not jquery
[06:13:00] <brokenshakles> I had some other stuff, but I couldnt even get it this far.
[06:13:15] <brokenshakles> I will be using jquery later on.
[06:13:37] <Cork> brokenshakles: also please don't use jsbin
[06:13:42] <brokenshakles> but still the push does not work, my url should change from index.html to home.html and it does not.
[06:13:47] <Cork> i've lost WAY to many answers to keep using it
[06:14:48] <brokenshakles> Do you know why?
[06:15:21] <Cork> $("nav a").find(".current").attr("href") == undefined
[06:15:42] <brokenshakles> What is the right way to poll for a href inside of my nav then?
[06:15:48] <Cork> you want $("nav a.current").attr("href")
[06:15:57] <brokenshakles> the one that is .current class.
[06:15:58] <Cork> current is an a not a child of it
[06:16:13] <brokenshakles> Ah!
[06:16:31] <brokenshakles> Still learning Js here. :)
[06:16:40] <Cork> well that part is css :)
[06:16:45] <Cork> not really js
[06:18:10] <brokenshakles> Should I still define old_href as a var?
[06:18:36] <MikeD_> admittedly, jquery does so much for us i can understand not being clear on the details that it manages
[06:19:27] <brokenshakles> so .attr .load and friends are not a part of jquery?
[06:21:19] <shoky> they are
[06:28:38] <DevAntoine> Cork: weird, your event listener to catch the clicked button does not work
[06:28:44] <DevAntoine> it is never fired
[06:29:05] <DevAntoine> if I just watch for click on inputs it works for non submit types
[06:34:39] <DevAntoine> rofl, it's a button, not an input
[06:34:41] <DevAntoine> my bad
[06:37:21] <b0t> I need replace all class for another classes
[06:37:26] <b0t> Each class has a link other than youtube, I want to use these links
[06:41:24] <b0t> I need convert this script to get by classname" Http://pastie.org/9769939
[06:45:17] <BillCriswell> b0t: $('.oldClass').removeClass('oldClass').addClass('newClass')
[06:45:37] <BillCriswell> or $('.oldClass').toggleClass('oldClass newClass');
[06:46:19] <b0t> BillCriswell::: Thank but i need replace all content in these classess
[06:46:19] <b0t> Http://pastie.org/9769939
[06:46:43] <b0t> <div class="youtube">LINK</div> to <iframe....
[06:46:55] <BillCriswell> I lost ya
[06:47:05] <BillCriswell> I mean... you lost me.
[06:47:43] <b0t> Then check the link
[06:48:47] <drager> I'm having some trouble; http://jsfiddle.net/x793tr1j/ my WindowManagement will be undefinedâ€¦â€¦ or object {}
[06:49:40] <drager> Can't figure it outâ€¦
[06:49:52] <mikunos1> hi guys is there a way to send a request by the "GET" method using the cleanurl ?
[06:51:01] <mikunos1> http://snipet.co.uk/xP
[06:51:22] <mikunos1> from ?query=value to /query/value
[06:52:33] <b0t> need, first, get all class, and parse the content, after return the result
[06:52:53] <mikunos1> from /admin/product/search/term/?term=test" to /admin/product/search/term/test"
[06:54:02] <mikunos1> this is my full code: http://snipet.co.uk/Pu
[06:54:11] <mikunos1> any idea?
[06:57:17] <b0t> Here now http://pastie.org/9770003
[06:58:09] <mikunos1> any hint?
[07:00:16] <brokenshakles> will this load all of my target mains children into my other main? $("main").hide.load(href + " main *", function()
[07:01:28] <Cork> brokenshakles: you need .hide() not .hide
[07:01:45] <Cork> but yes the rest should work, as long as you don't have any text directly in main
[07:02:35] <Cork> brokenshakles: though i would prob recommend sending partials in those cases instead of the full page
[07:02:38] <brokenshakles> In subcontainers is fine?
[07:02:54] <Cork> of you mean child elements, yes
[07:03:39] <brokenshakles> does FadeIn undo hide?
[07:05:44] <brokenshakles> hmm its only displaying text on my loaded main, and not any of the container elements.
[07:07:20] <brokenshakles> Oh, wait, it must not be loading the css file for the loaded main.
[07:09:52] <MarkyC> How can I catch a paste event on the page? Not pasted into an input, but just pasted onto the page ($(document).on('paste') only works when pasted into something, like an input field
[07:11:48] <mikunos1> any hint guys?
[07:12:08] <brokenshakles> Hmm, is there any way to load and unload css files on the fly?
[07:12:36] <mikunos1> yes, use firebug brokenshakles
[07:18:56] <drager> I'm having some trouble, getting undefined when I trying to do new WindowManagement; http://jsfiddle.net/n1tkz2wg/
[07:21:56] <BillCriswell> brokenshakles: remove the link element or add a new one.
[07:22:41] <brokenshakles> Right, but stuffing all by .css files into my index my cause namespace issues as my site grows.
[07:23:21] <BillCriswell> brokenshakles: I might be misunderstanding.
[07:24:19] <BillCriswell> You asked to load or unload css files. You can do that by adding and removing the link elements they're linked from.
[07:25:04] <BillCriswell> mikunos1: That's more of a server side question.
[07:25:19] <mikunos1> BillCriswell no at all
[07:26:12] <BillCriswell> mikunos1: Are you trying to change the url to just be "clean"?
[07:27:43] <mikunos1> If I set the GET parameter I will see in the URL bar ?term=test
[07:27:50] <mikunos1> right?
[07:28:02] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:28:33] <mikunos1> I need that the ajax redirect compose a new url with /term/test
[07:28:38] <mikunos1> is it possible?
[07:29:21] <hlvwrk> o_O
[07:30:48] <BillCriswell> You can alter the url in beforeSend maybe, but I don't htink there's a built in way.
[07:32:00] <BillCriswell> mikunos1: Why do you need to do that though? The server should have no problem getting them either way?
[07:32:28] <mikunos1> I need it in order to maintain a standard request
[07:33:15] <MarkyC> Can someone help me write a selector for all inputs with a name that starts with verify that is checked?
[07:33:45] <MarkyC> I've tried: $('input:checked[name^=verify]'); and  $('input[name^=verify]:checkd');
[07:33:56] <MarkyC> without the typo on the last one though
[07:40:53] <cjohnson> first one seems to work fine for me
[07:41:25] <BillCriswell> mikunos1: There's a beforeSend callback that you can use to alter the url that's sent.
[07:42:09] <cjohnson> MarkyC: http://jsfiddle.net/m4qwLtjy/1/
[07:42:20] <BillCriswell> mikunos1: Something like $.ajax({ beforeSend: function (xhr, setting) { settings.url = settings.url.makePrettyAndShit(); } });
[07:42:31] <mikunos1> ok
[07:42:45] <BillCriswell> mikunos1: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[07:42:58] <mikunos1> thanks
[07:42:58] <BillCriswell> Wish they'd put some id's in there so I can link directly to the callback.
[07:43:02] <BillCriswell> mikunos1: No problem.
[07:58:25] <b0t> Anybody help me?
[08:00:00] <cjohnson> nobody can
[08:00:30] <BillCriswell> b0t: What happened with the iframe?
[08:00:55] <b0t> I need replace and parse the content of all div´s
[08:01:07] <b0t> <div class="youtube">link video
[08:01:17] <b0t> For </iframe bla bla bla
[08:02:01] <BillCriswell> What about the iframe?
[08:02:13] <b0t> First, i need the content of the div and after parse the link
[08:02:33] <b0t> Nothing
[08:03:30] <b0t> Or find a link and parse it
[08:03:57] <BillCriswell> I'm missing something huge here.
[08:04:17] <brokenshakles> is there any way to disable a <a>'s onclick event inside of css?
[08:04:34] <BillCriswell> brokenshakles: pointer-events: none; maybe?
[08:04:43] <b0t> No
[08:05:05] <BillCriswell> brokenshakles: The support for that is slim though.
[08:05:13] <brokenshakles> I'm trying to redirect a click from a hyperlink via .delegate
[08:05:19] <b0t> <div class="youtube">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFv50ouqH-4#t=51</div>
[08:05:30] <b0t> I need convert the content of all divs youtube
[08:05:37] <b0t> To iframe video
[08:05:43] <b0t> Understand?
[08:05:53] <b0t> Var res1 = str.replace(/http:\/\/\www.youtube.com\/watch\\?v=/g, "");
[08:05:54] <b0t> Var res2 = '"//www.youtube.com/embed/' + res1 + '"'
[08:05:56] <BillCriswell> That's much clearer than whatver you were saying previously.
[08:06:23] <b0t> Yes, sorry
[08:06:24] <cjohnson> $('.youtube').each(function() { $(this).html('<iframe src="' + $(this).html() + '"></iframe>'); });
[08:06:27] <cjohnson> something along those lines
[08:06:32] <b0t> :o
[08:06:40] <brokenshakles> but every time I click on my <a> that I have set up for delegation, it behaves in a normal manner.
[08:06:56] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Why are you just giving answers don't you want people to learn?
[08:07:05] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: ;)
[08:07:07] <b0t> cjohnson::: Ure a crack
[08:07:08] <cjohnson> hahaha
[08:07:09] <b0t> Thanksss
[08:07:20] <cjohnson> I just got the feeling it would be futile BillCriswell
[08:07:42] <b0t> But i need convert
[08:08:05] <b0t> Http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFv50ouqH-4#t=51 to //www.youtube.com/embed/JFv50ouqH-4#t=51
[08:08:20] <b0t> And after put in the html
[08:09:09] <b0t> I need get the id of the link "JFv50ouqH-4#t=51"
[08:09:38] <BillCriswell> b0t: replace http:// with '' and /watch? with /embed/
[08:10:33] <b0t> Watch?v= with embed/
[08:10:34] <b0t> Yes
[08:13:46] <decx> html() has a built in each btw
[08:13:56] <decx> oh i was scrolled
[08:14:27] <BillCriswell> decx: I hate when that happens.
[08:14:47] <b0t> $(".youtube:contains('http')").html('blablaaa');
[08:14:48] <b0t> ?
[08:14:52] <decx> i just imagine mr t calling me a fool and move on
[08:16:00] <BillCriswell> b0t: What?
[08:16:03] <_DB> can I do a foreach data.return_from_ajax in javascript?
[08:16:04] <_DB> or should I just do a for using its lentgh and go through the array?
[08:16:55] <BillCriswell> _DB: If you only have to suppord ie9 and up and you use [].forEach
[08:17:08] <BillCriswell> but a for() would work just as well
[08:17:17] <_DB> would a for work on all browsers?
[08:17:33] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:17:44] <_DB> ok
[08:17:50] <benighted> hey all, not really a programmer but have a jquery script that I'm using to show/hide form fields based on a radio selection - here are the two ways I've tried http://pastebin.com/jed0Rj7x
[08:18:53] <benighted> they are hidden, and appear when the radio button is selected, but if another is selected it won't re-hide the conditional fields
[08:18:59] <_DB> would this work  for(var temp=0;temp<=data.cart_items.length;temp++)
[08:18:59] <_DB> ?
[08:19:09] <_DB> or am I missing () after length?
[08:19:23] <BillCriswell> Nope, it's a property not a method.
[08:19:26] <BillCriswell> so no ()
[08:19:30] <brokenshakles> nm I found a javascript function that disables the default behavior of links quite cleanly.
[08:19:39] <BillCriswell> As long as cart_items is an array that should work just fine.
[08:19:56] <BillCriswell> brokenshakles: event.preventDefault()
[08:20:08] <brokenshakles> thats the one!
[08:20:37] <brokenshakles> I just set it up when index.html loads, and now my nav bar works right, with fading effects.
[08:22:25] <BillCriswell> benighted: I'd approach this a little different. You just want some more options to show when a given option is chosen, right?
[08:22:40] <benighted> BillCriswell: yes
[08:24:03] <BillCriswell> benighted: I'd use a data attribute on the inputs, like... <input type="radio" data-expand="#some-div">
[08:24:22] <BillCriswell> then when it's selected hide all the "expandables" and only show the select from data-expand.
[08:24:44] <BillCriswell> I can set up a little demo if you want some clarification.
[08:24:52] <benighted> BillCriswell: that would be fantastic
[08:25:45] <benighted> BillCriswell: I'm with you on the logic, but still a bit fuzzy on how to implement
[08:25:46] <cjohnson> _DB: you can use forEach on that. use es5-shim if you need to support old browsers. otherwise yeah for loop is fine
[08:26:51] <brokenshakles> is there any way to turn off the dotted border that appears around the last clicked link?
[08:27:31] <cjohnson> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12234653/avoid-dashed-border-around-clicked-link
[08:28:20] <BillCriswell> benighted: http://jsbin.com/koviyoyibo/1/edit?html,js,output something along the lines of this.
[08:29:31] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/koviyoyibo/3/edit?js,output updated a bit.
[08:31:09] <b0t> BillCriswell::: I need replace!!
[08:31:35] <cjohnson> lol I told you the answer b0t
[08:32:13] <b0t> Nono, my code is for all people here
[08:32:25] <b0t> When i puta a youtube link , jquery convert to iframe
[08:32:55] <brokenshakles> Ug, why aren't my horizontal section margins collapsing?
[08:33:09] <b0t> $(this).html.replace('http', ':'); no work
[08:34:42] <benighted> BillCriswell, exactly what I was looking for - thank you very much!
[08:34:46] <cjohnson> there's no such thing as $(this).html b0t
[08:34:53] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:40:39] <mariuscc>  /join #css

[08:41:02] <b0t> /sajoin mariuscc #css
[08:41:12] <qizwiz> I'm trying to create a modal that displays a different div depending on which button the user presses. I've got everything rendering, but if I click one button and then cancel, it affects the display of the other modal
[08:42:33] <brokenshakles> is there a popstate like call for detecting a page reload?
[08:43:10] <qizwiz> here are the functions in question: https://gist.github.com/129b531417dc68701b2d
[08:44:35] <qizwiz> dang, it didn't grab both. let me try again
[08:45:14] <qizwiz> https://gist.github.com/0630f32e837f648472ce
[08:56:25] <brokenshakles> Hmm, can margins collapse inside of a flexbox?
[08:59:12] <BillCriswell> brokenshakles: Sounds like #css.
[09:07:00] <benighted> BillCriswell: I've converted my form html and js and working wonderfully with exception I have one id with two sub-options, when I select the suboption it clears both the original type and itself
[09:07:03] <Guddu_> Is it possible to do a Non-Ajax POST using JQuery? And ot fetch the result in a Modal Dialog?
[09:07:18] <robertmaxrees> Guddu_ that's a normal form post.
[09:07:35] <robertmaxrees> Guddu_ without ajax, you're submitting a normal form :)
[09:07:46] <BillCriswell> benighted: Hard time imagining that in my head.
[09:07:57] <Guddu_> robertmaxrees, Thanks. I want to press a button and the result will be a PDF Response. I Want to show it in the modal. And hence my query.
[09:08:09] <Guddu_> I believe that Ajax cannot render PDF like this.
[09:08:49] <benighted> BillCriswell: Type is door, subtypes are interior or exterior, exterior has additional options that interior does not but selecting exterior clears the 'door' parent selection
[09:09:07] <arschmitz> Guddu_: you could instead return a link to the pdf and then embed that
[09:09:51] <Guddu_> I tried with Ajax but i get a garbled Text. Its as if the browser is interpreting the output as HTML, resulting in ugly output in the browser window
[09:10:08] <Guddu_> arschmitz, The PDF is not a Physical file and hence no URL.
[09:10:38] <Guddu_> I am not generating the PDF on Server as a physical file. Just in Memory.
[09:11:05] <BillCriswell> benighted: If you wanted to you could do like... data-expand="#id1,#id2"
[09:11:12] <BillCriswell> to keep them both visible.
[09:11:47] <sung> hey guys, i believe i'm making a really stupid mistake here. i'm using an anonymous function within the document/ready block that calls another function with two args, one of them being a div element ala $("div1"). within the other function, i'm trying to call the html method to change some text. and it doesn't work. BUT, if i call the method within the anonymus function that's part of a document.ready/zip.keyup block, it works fine. i believe it's something 
[09:11:54] <arschmitz> Guddu_: you will probably have to do something pretty convoluted using iframes them.
[09:12:07] <Guddu_> arschmitz, robertmaxrees I came across this method but I cannot figure out how to pass the post data to the URL http://codepen.io/pwasiewi/pen/igBpH
[09:13:26] <arschmitz> Guddu_: like capture the submit, create an iframe have the iframe do the post and render the pdf and just show the iframe
[09:13:57] <Guddu_> arschmitz, Thanks I will try that now. Thanks for the guidance. Much appreciated.
[09:14:43] <benighted> BillCriswell: beautiful, thanks
[09:14:52] <BillCriswell> benighted: No problem.
[09:16:34] <matthewk> using jquery 1.11, the load function is successfully loading a remote script into a div container; however, the complete callback doesn't seem to fire. is there anything i can check?
[09:17:34] <matthewk> i can see in firebug the get request, and i can see on the UI the div container being populated w/ the html from that get response
[09:17:56] <cjohnson> let's see your code
[09:19:33] <lstude> I'm attempting to use .ajax() to determine the logged in/logged out state of a user but it's not working. Can someone take a look at lines 4-12 specifically and LMK what i may be missing? http://jsfiddle.net/lstude/vkxk4rzb/2/
[09:20:51] <matthewk> $( "#success" ).load( "/not-here.php", function( response, status, xhr ) { if ( status == "error" ) { var msg = "Sorry but there was an error: "; $( "#error" ).html( msg + xhr.status + " " + xhr.statusText ); } });
[09:22:15] <pll^> hey guys, if I had <li>one</li> <li>two></li> .. <li>ten</li>..    each have a class of 'foo' and one is selected at a time.   Using jquery, I want to target a certain index within that list (0-9) and change it to be selected, how would i target the certain <li>?
[09:23:39] <cjohnson> matthewk: check the headers of the request and make sure it didn't return a 404 or something
[09:24:32] <matthewk> cjohnson: ok, thanks
[09:24:59] <cjohnson> how are you sure that the complete function isn't firing btw?
[09:25:33] <cjohnson> if status isn't error it could be firing and just not doing anything
[09:26:07] <matthewk> i have tried an else after the if with a console.log and alert statements
[09:26:30] <cjohnson> and you're sure #error exists? I would just put a console.log outside the if check right at the beginning of the complete function
[09:26:33] <cjohnson> to be sure it's firing
[09:26:37] <matthewk> the actual loaded script is getting a 200, but the script contains a js file, which is getting a 404 when trying to load that part
[09:26:48] <matthewk> ok, thanks
[09:26:54] <cjohnson> that shouldn't stop the complete from firing
[09:28:44] <supsup> is there a best practice for a sticky menu that starts 200px from the top of the page and then sticks when it gets to the top of the page (when the user is scrolling down the page)....so that you don't use the window scroll event (which I've read is bad to do)
[09:28:58] <cjohnson> position: fixed
[09:29:29] <supsup> cjohnson but don't you have to keep seeing where it is to decide to put it in that state?
[09:29:47] <supsup> since at the start it's 200px down the page, and only after the person scrolls down 200px does it go to fixed at the top?
[09:29:58] <supsup> and when they scroll back up the page if they get to the part where the content is before it
[09:30:04] <supsup> you have to put it back where it was before
[09:30:13] <supsup> the idea i thought of was to be a scroll event on window
[09:30:15] <cjohnson> yeah that's fine. they just don't want you to keep repositioning the element on page scroll
[09:30:20] <supsup> but that is bad according to articles i read
[09:30:29] <cjohnson> but checking the page scroll and changing an elements position: fixed property isn't too bad
[09:30:31] <supsup> how else would you do it?
[09:30:32] <cjohnson> based on scroll
[09:30:56] <cjohnson> on scroll if scrollTop > 200: position fixed, else position relative/absolute
[09:31:22] <cjohnson> that way you're still using CSS to do the actual fixed positioning, which I think is what the article was probably trying to get you to do
[09:31:23] <supsup> yah but that would happen every time you scroll
[09:31:51] <cjohnson> that's fine
[09:31:56] <supsup> john resig article says .scroll on window is horrible
[09:32:04] <cjohnson> you're missing details
[09:32:07] <cjohnson> or it's wrong
[09:32:09] <snover> and how old is this article
[09:32:16] <supsup> pretty old
[09:32:20] <cjohnson> I think they're saying that *repositioning* elements on every scroll is bad
[09:32:22] <cjohnson> which it is
[09:32:28] <cjohnson> but you're just checking the scrollTop
[09:32:29] <cjohnson> that's not bad
[09:33:03] <supsup> http://ejohn.org/blog/learning-from-twitter/
[09:33:18] <supsup> Itâ€™s a very, very, bad idea to attach handlers to the window scroll event. Depending upon the browser the scroll event can fire a lot and putting code in the scroll callback will slow down any attempts to scroll the page (not a good idea).
[09:33:31] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:33:33] <sung> got it. i was missing a #
[09:35:22] <cjohnson> supsup: I think that's a mis-statement. just be careful what you put in the scroll event
[09:35:33] <robertmaxrees> these days it's generally not a big issue.
[09:35:34] <supsup> alright i'll give it a shot
[09:35:50] <robertmaxrees> what you're doing inside that handler is much more imporant than binding the handler itself imo.
[09:36:17] <cjohnson> it does seem to matter with OS X finger gestures
[09:36:28] <cjohnson> they seem to fire a lot more scroll events than a simple scroll wheel
[09:36:42] <cjohnson> but yeah as long as you use your wits it's fine
[09:36:55] <supsup> alright i'll try his timer idea
[09:37:27] <cjohnson> you can use underscore's debounce function for easier implementation of the timer idea
[09:38:06] <supsup> can't add underscore to this project without going through too many meetings to get approval.
[09:38:27] <supsup> an't nobody got time for that.
[09:38:31] <cjohnson> you can just copy that one function
[09:38:38] <supsup> hurm alright will take a look
[09:38:40] <cjohnson> here it is http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
[09:38:52] <supsup> thanks, will read
[09:38:53] <cjohnson> very handy little thing
[09:39:54] <supsup> yah that's cool
[09:42:57] <matthewk> cjohnson: seems if there's a js file in the remote script that responds with 404, then it will actually not call the complete callback
[09:43:31] <matthewk> cjohnson: i tried with removing the script statement that was getting 404, and the callback was getting called
[09:43:58] <cjohnson> weird
[09:46:38] <MarkyC> cjohnson: Thanks, looks like I had a bit of an XY problem :/
[09:51:05] <Guddu_> Can a jquery.load() call return a PDF Response Object?
[09:51:40] <Guddu_> And if yes then what shall be the way to render it so that the output does not get interpreted as HTML but as PDF?
[09:52:26] <cjohnson> it would treat it as HTML, you'll have to decide how you want to render the PDF and use that approach accordingly
[09:52:36] <cjohnson> there's a pure javascript renderer: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js
[09:53:07] <cjohnson> looks like the second answer suggests google will let you use their docs reader in an iframe as well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/291813/recommended-way-to-embed-pdf-in-html
[09:53:11] <Guddu_> Thanks cjohnson
[09:56:27] <fschuindt> Guys, I am trying to use the JqPlot plugin in a hidden div but it does not work, I already seen some questions on StackOverflow but anything that helped me. I made this simple jsfiddle to illustrate my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/fqkd64c1/ Any help?
[09:59:04] <Guddu_> cjohnson, The pdf.js solution depends on the PDF file being physically present on the server. In my case I am building PDF on the fly and in memory and cannot save it to disk.
[10:00:33] <cjohnson> I thought you were fetching it from a remote URL?
[10:00:45] <cjohnson> just plug in whatever URL you were going to feed to .load
[10:20:23] <hackal> does .height() also counts in paddings and margins?
[10:22:11] <cjohnson> http://api.jquery.com/height/
[10:23:15] <Zzaichik> so .outerHeight()
[10:24:15] <Zzaichik> .outerHeight(true)
[10:27:42] <cjohnson> are you asking about hackal's question Zzaichik?
[10:28:02] <Zzaichik> answering, yes. cjohnson
[10:28:31] <cjohnson> oh, right. yeah if you want to include paddings and margins that would be outerHeight
[10:29:26] <cjohnson> depends what he was after, he didn't specify if that was what he wanted ;)
[10:29:32] <Stummi> Hi, am I getting this right, that it won't consider the display attribute? http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/ -- I want to select elements where display is not none.
[10:29:33] <Zzaichik> yeah :)
[10:30:08] <cjohnson> it will select all visible elements
[10:30:13] <cjohnson> display is part of that calculation
[10:30:32] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm trying to figure out how I can do someting like $('selector').on('keyup,change', function() {});
[10:30:46] <decx> lose the ,
[10:31:13] <mooncup> yo checkit if that's a form field you may wanna use on input change
[10:31:34] <cjohnson> he's got on change ;)
[10:31:35] <checkit> mooncup: I need to action as items are typed.
[10:32:01] <cjohnson> Stummi: actually it looks like it just checks the offsetWidth and offsetHeight now: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/740e190223d19a114d5373758127285d14d6b71e/src/css/hiddenVisibleSelectors.js
[10:32:08] <cjohnson> but I assume if display: none offsetWidth will be 0
[10:32:23] <cjohnson> if you explicitly want to check for display: none then I would check for that explicitly
[10:34:22] <wodim> oh it's cjohnson
[10:37:01] <spudzee> http://jsfiddle.net/qyp1masc/ I know this belongs in #css. but I can't seem to get an answer from them. Why isn't this working?
[10:37:19] <cjohnson> is it unemployed?
[10:37:36] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:37:42] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting to happen there?
[10:38:02] <robertmaxrees> because that fiddle is doing what i'd expect it to.
[10:38:04] <spudzee> If you're not using a phone, then it should run that css
[10:38:08] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/qyp1masc/1/
[10:38:09] <robertmaxrees> it should?
[10:38:24] <spudzee> AH
[10:38:26] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:38:43] <spudzee> then why doesn't my website work :(
[10:38:53] <cjohnson> did you put that class on your <html> tag?
[10:39:05] <cjohnson> it doesn't just happen automatically
[10:39:18] <spudzee> yeah
[10:39:30] <spudzee> what does class='no-touch' do?
[10:39:43] <cjohnson> you're the one who wrote  html.no-touch #thing
[10:39:44] <spudzee> that's the only thing I don't have in there
[10:40:09] <spudzee> when you made the html tag, you put class='no-touch'
[10:40:14] <cjohnson> that selector says find a node with id=thing inside of an <html class="no-touch"> tag
[10:40:19] <robertmaxrees> spudzee that class doesn't magically exist.
[10:40:23] <robertmaxrees> something has to add it.
[10:40:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not a media query though.
[10:40:35] <spudzee> yeah, maybe I'm missing something
[10:40:52] <robertmaxrees> apropos to your question in #css ;)
[10:41:38] <spudzee> when I put this question in there it wasn't answered
[10:41:52] <spudzee> okay, let's talk about media queries then
[10:41:57] <robertmaxrees> they go through lulls sometimes.
[10:42:06] <cjohnson> could try #web (##web ??)
[10:42:11] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries
[10:42:19] <robertmaxrees> start here for media query information.
[10:42:42] <robertmaxrees> ask in #css if you have questions.  we can try to help here on occasion, though another channel being dead doesn't really change the subject of this one ;)
[10:42:45] <benighted> BillCriswell: Hi Bill, do you know how I could get both radio buttons to stay checked for both 'Bathroom' and 'Whatever Bathroom' http://jsbin.com/jasageduwi/1/edit
[10:43:13] <cjohnson> they would need different names
[10:43:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:43:20] <cjohnson> otherwise that's not a radio, that's checkboxes
[10:45:55] <BillCriswell> Yes, what cjohnson said.
[10:46:42] <spudzee> okay, I have a question actually relevant to #jquery
[10:47:28] <spudzee> what's the difference between using :hover in css and jquery's $('#whatever').mouseenter() ?
[10:47:41] <robertmaxrees> one uses javascript events.
[10:47:43] <robertmaxrees> the other CSS.
[10:47:52] <robertmaxrees> two different concepts.
[10:48:21] <spudzee> I understand that, but which is better for, say, making a button that when hovered over, will change colors?
[10:48:28] <robertmaxrees> CSS
[10:48:35] <robertmaxrees> when possible, use CSS.
[10:48:46] <BillCriswell> Javascript is your backup plan.
[10:48:46] <spudzee> but css won't make it animated?
[10:48:56] <robertmaxrees> CSS transitions.
[10:49:34] <spudzee> never realized how useful CSS is
[10:50:24] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:50:27] <BillCriswell> spudzee: Just keep in mind... hover is only useful when there's a mouse.
[10:50:41] <spudzee> yeah
[10:51:16] <BillCriswell> or the weird looking stylus thingie I saw with that random phone in the store that day.
[10:51:26] <spudzee> I was looking at pseudo-classes on that doc that robert linked
[11:10:55] <checkit> Can any kind sole here help me figure out why this "remove row" function isn't working: http://jsfiddle.net/7bve1tx6/
[11:11:27] <cjohnson> well firstly use closest instead of parent
[11:11:39] <cjohnson> $(this).closest('tr').remove()
[11:11:53] <cjohnson> also your class has a dot in its name
[11:12:01] <cjohnson> so the selector would actually be ..deleteRow
[11:12:12] <cjohnson> you just want class="deleteRow"
[11:12:17] <cjohnson> and then the selector is .deleteRow
[11:16:15] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[11:24:55] <checkit> cjohnson: the . in my class was a typo. But thank you for you suggestion.
[11:33:52] <supsup> cjohnson / robertmaxrees thanks for info earlier, seems to work well (debounce/scroll issue)
[11:34:23] <cjohnson> sweet
[11:35:14] <supsup> i need to use underscore a lot more i think ;-0.
[11:35:23] <cjohnson> I'm interested in it also
[11:35:50] <supsup> i've known about it forever but stack we are using its a pain to get approval to add new src' files
[11:36:03] <supsup> but should not really stop me from learning about it on my own ~~
[11:36:10] <cjohnson> that sucks
[11:36:18] <cjohnson> so glad to have a job that doesn't work like that anymore
[11:36:40] <supsup> it's not too bad, i've seen some people who don't know what they are doing try to put some dubious stuff in our code bases.
[11:37:11] <supsup> it's not impossible just there is a process you have to go through.
[11:38:53] <cjohnson> yeah it can be useful if you have huge disjointed IT teams
[11:39:01] <cjohnson> which is what I'm glad to be rid of
[11:39:22] <cjohnson> I like a nice tight team where people are responsible for themselves. code review is good enough to catch junior level mistakes
[11:40:43] <supsup> heh must be nice ;-0
[11:41:06] <supsup> but yah code was really simple.   mostly because of the debounce function.
[11:45:20] <supsup> cjohnson here is idea briefly made into fiddle if you want to check it out  http://jsfiddle.net/hjtz2qh1/
[11:46:27] <johnslegers> Is there anyone here who was present at the 1PM - 2PM meeting on the CSS framework?
[11:47:28] <johnslegers> I couldn't be present at the meetiing and would love to get an idea of what I missed
[11:47:29] <robertmaxrees> johnslegers which meeting?
[11:47:31] <supsup> can lower time more and more and it gets more smooth...so still a little janky.
[11:47:44] <supsup> did not know there was a css meeting for jquery
[11:47:54] <supsup> like jqueryui or something?
[11:47:55] <johnslegers> this meeting --> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/18
[11:48:11] <robertmaxrees> this isn't the jquery meeting channel :)
[11:48:20] <robertmaxrees> you want #jquery-meeting
[11:49:34] <BillCriswell> That must be where the cool people hang out.
[11:49:41] <cjohnson> honestly I don't think you want debounce here supsup now that I'm looking at it
[11:49:42] <supsup> yah
[11:49:45] <supsup> never heard of it
[11:49:49] <cjohnson> it makes the behvior finnicky
[11:49:57] <BillCriswell> I should go in and ask about datatables.
[11:49:59] <cjohnson> when I remove the debounce from your example it works perfectly for me
[11:50:01] <supsup> can set it to a low value tho?
[11:50:08] <supsup> but then its doing what john said not to do
[11:50:23] <cjohnson> no, he was telling you not to put any heavy calculations in the onscroll
[11:50:27] <robertmaxrees> supsup that article is YEARS old
[11:50:30] <cjohnson> checking scrollTop isn't heavy
[11:50:32] <cjohnson> and also that
[11:50:48] <robertmaxrees> that's from around 2010 i'm guessing.
[11:50:50] <supsup> so it's not worth it to use debounce to at least force a 40 ms pause?
[11:50:59] <supsup> some of my clients still use IE8 bro
[11:50:59] <cjohnson> it makes the behavior odd for me
[11:51:05] <cjohnson> IE8 is still fine
[11:51:10] <cjohnson> avoiding onscroll is more for IE6
[11:51:20] <supsup> alrght
[11:51:22] <cjohnson> and even then... if you're careful you can still use onscroll
[11:51:32] <robertmaxrees> supsup i'm not sure what exactly you're doing, but the issue with scrol event handlers is to make sure you're not doing complex selecting and manipulation in your handler.
[11:51:34] <cjohnson> this code would probably run fine even in IE6
[11:51:49] <supsup> heh i just rem that article from years ago
[11:51:52] <supsup> reading it
[11:52:01] <robertmaxrees> we're on version 1.11 right now.
[11:52:21] <robertmaxrees> also: papa resig isn't as intimately involved in jquery these days.  still important, but lots of factors to take into consideration.
[11:52:35] <supsup> so your saying this right cjohnson? http://jsfiddle.net/hjtz2qh1/1/
[11:52:54] <supsup> and get ride of the debounce ref that is no longer being used
[11:52:55] <cjohnson> yep looks fine
[11:53:16] <cjohnson> all you're doing in that function is reading the scrollTop and then changing a CSS property
[11:53:21] <supsup> alright, why john troll me like that.
[11:53:26] <supsup> jk i get it now ;-0
[11:53:52] <robertmaxrees> also, cache window.,
[11:53:54] <supsup> still cool to know about that function thanks ~
[11:53:56] <robertmaxrees> var $window = $(window);
[11:54:01] <supsup> k
[11:54:02] <robertmaxrees> then read the cached version.
[11:54:14] <robertmaxrees> also, check to see if the thing is already fixed and only change when necessary.
[11:54:24] <robertmaxrees> to avoid the conditional.
[11:56:23] <supsup> not sure what you mean by that, get the cache window idea
[11:56:33] <supsup> err, i get the cache window idea
[11:56:40] <supsup> but not sure how i can avoid the if
[11:56:43] <supsup> if/else
[11:56:53] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/hjtz2qh1/2/
[11:57:02] <cjohnson> read the element's position, if it's not fixed, then do the if block you have here
[11:57:13] <ThePendulum> Hey. I'm working on a chat that adds a new line to the bottom of the page. What can I do to auto-scroll the page to the very bottom once it overflows?
[11:57:22] <ThePendulum> So the chat scrolls off the top rather than the bottom
[11:57:36] <cjohnson> though I don't think that matters, since setting position: fixed on a position: fixed element shouldn't cause a reflow afaik
[11:58:05] <supsup> oh so he was saying to add another conditional around my css rule
[11:58:06] <robertmaxrees> jquery checks ahead of time for you anyway, and I'm all funky-headed today so my idea was off.
[11:58:07] <BillCriswell> ThePendulum: You can set scrollTop as scrollHeight
[11:58:15] <robertmaxrees> nah, ignore me.
[11:58:23] <BillCriswell> or scrollHeight + height... one or the other.
[11:58:25] <robertmaxrees> i was trying to think if there's a way to avoid the myTop calculation.
[11:58:26] <checkit> Is anyone familiar with bootstrap-slider.js? I'm having trouble updatind the slider by editing the numberControl field.... http://jsfiddle.net/1mkph66g/
[11:58:53] <supsup> alright well window cache was good idea ;-0...john even said to do that too
[11:59:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:59:00] <supsup> i did it with one id just not window
[11:59:14] <robertmaxrees> any time you can store a reference to a selector is a good idea.
[11:59:19] <supsup> yah
[11:59:20] <robertmaxrees> instead of reselecting.
[11:59:24] <supsup> i agree.
[12:00:36] <ThePendulum> BillCriswell: Odd, got it to work suddenly, cheers
[12:00:55] <BillCriswell> Damn. Out of here quick.
[12:00:58] <BillCriswell> I feel used.
[12:02:20] <checkit> I won't use you BillCriswell :)
[12:02:25] <checkit> Help me help me
[12:09:57] <cjohnson> you most certainly can
[12:15:15] <LessonsByConnor> What's the correct function to look into to change div elements based on a user's vertical position?
[12:15:23] <LessonsByConnor> I'm having a hard time phrasing this for a Google search.
[12:15:38] <cjohnson> based on a user's scroll you mean?
[12:15:40] <robertmaxrees> like, while the user is scrolling?
[12:15:54] <robertmaxrees> .on() for pretty much any event
[12:15:59] <LessonsByConnor> Yeah see: learnpythonthehardway.org
[12:16:06] <LessonsByConnor> How it "pops in" based on user position
[12:16:23] <robertmaxrees> $(window).on('scroll', function() {});
[12:16:25] <matthewk> setting <base href="..."/> in main page is working fine. when i do jquery load, the html in the response doesn't seem to acknowledge the base href that's set in the main page. so images and scripts are broken src's
[12:16:28] <BillCriswell> scrollspy ?
[12:16:37] <robertmaxrees> scrollspy is another one.
[12:16:39] <LessonsByConnor> I was looking at bootstrap's scrollspy
[12:16:50] <LessonsByConnor> but is thee a way to do this naturally was my question
[12:16:53] <LessonsByConnor> using jquery
[12:17:01] <matthewk> is there a way to get it to obey the base href in the page that it's loaded into? or some other solution?
[12:17:07] <LessonsByConnor> i'll look into robert's example
[12:17:12] <robertmaxrees> LessonsByConnor superscrollorama
[12:17:12] <robertmaxrees> that'
[12:17:16] <robertmaxrees> *that's what he's using.
[12:17:24] <LessonsByConnor> a plugin im assuming?
[12:17:27] <LessonsByConnor> ill search it
[12:17:37] <robertmaxrees> http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/ yep
[12:17:38] <supsup> is it bad that i use the old event handlers still ;/....( i know they just get rerouted to .on anyway
[12:17:52] <matthewk> loading the html into a temp element, then moving it to the desired element works okay to modify the src's of all the elements, but there are some things i can't fix with this easily.
[12:17:53] <BillCriswell> supsup: That depends. Do you like killing kittens
[12:17:56] <robertmaxrees> supsup not necessarily.  i personally prefer using .on() for all event bindings.
[12:18:03] <supsup> i have two live cats
[12:18:07] <supsup> they used to be kittens
[12:18:17] <BillCriswell> So they're not... techincally...
[12:18:18] <matthewk> for example js that's changing the src of some element.. it's hard to find that in the source that's retrieved via jquery load
[12:18:20] <BillCriswell> whatever. You're ok.
[12:18:35] <supsup> i'm sayin' they lived so obviously i don't like killing them
[12:18:39] <LessonsByConnor> robertmaxrees: Thanks man. +1
[12:18:42] <BillCriswell> matthewk: Check the .prop('href') maybe?
[12:18:44] <robertmaxrees> LessonsByConnor fsh
[12:18:46] <robertmaxrees> *fsho
[12:19:11] <matthewk> what about js that's changing the src of something with relative path ?
[12:19:40] <matthewk> if i could get the jquery load result to obey the base href in the main page, that would be best
[12:20:30] <cjohnson> matthewk <base> is really a last resort
[12:20:36] <cjohnson> you should fix the paths in your server side
[12:21:13] <matthewk> that's not a good choice when it's a ton of code :)
[12:21:27] <cjohnson> it's the only real answer
[12:21:33] <cjohnson> there's no quick solution as you're seeing now
[12:21:40] <BillCriswell> matthewk: http://jsbin.com/zoruravumo/1/edit?html,js,output this appears to work?
[12:21:41] <matthewk> a lot of the code is unaccessible for me to change
[12:21:44] <cjohnson> but once you fix it once, it will be fixed always
[12:21:54] <cjohnson> there's all sorts of clever solutions in the server side
[12:22:02] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson eh, sometimes you're dumped into a project that you don't have that luxury on.
[12:22:24] <BillCriswell> Er, more useful: http://jsbin.com/zoruravumo/2/edit?js,output
[12:22:24] <cjohnson> well sure and if <base> works for that situation then great
[12:22:41] <cjohnson> but if you're jumping hoops to shim the <base> behavior everywhere else, you're better off just fixing it properly
[12:22:52] <robertmaxrees> depending on how long the proper fix would take ;)
[12:22:54] <matthewk> cjohnson: with iis or the script ?
[12:23:16] <cjohnson> hard to say. I would probably look at fixing it on deploy
[12:23:29] <cjohnson> depends how you're structured
[12:23:37] <matthewk> <base> behavior is working great for the main page. jquery's load response is not obeying the <base> href for it's relative src content...
[12:23:38] <BillCriswell> Oke doke
[12:23:39] <cjohnson> what are you trying to solve btw?
[12:23:43] <jeffmjack_> eek what happened to jsfiddle??
[12:23:51] <cjohnson> matthewk: right, and nor will it.
[12:24:05] <cjohnson> so you're either going to have to shim the <base> behavior for all of your javascript
[12:24:06] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ nothing?
[12:24:08] <cjohnson> or fix it on the backend
[12:24:12] <BillCriswell> Hmm... why wouldn't it/
[12:24:15] <matthewk> i wonder why it doesn't... it's all html
[12:24:17] <jeffmjack_> i'm getting a 404
[12:24:28] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ working for me.
[12:24:32] <BillCriswell> matthewk: Do you have a demo somewhere?
[12:24:33] <cjohnson> because <base> wasn't created with the modern web in mind
[12:24:45] <jeffmjack_> it's redirecting to http://jsfiddle.net/cgi-bin/redirect.ha
[12:24:54] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:24:55] <matthewk> cjohnson: i see. BillCriswell, no, sorry.
[12:25:03] <jeffmjack_> and reporting a 404
[12:25:11] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ http://superuser.com/questions/787576/why-do-i-keep-getting-redirected-to-cgi-bin-redirect-ha-when-using-att-u-ve
[12:25:21] <BillCriswell> matthewk: http://jsbin.com/zoruravumo/3/edit?html,js,output Did you see this?
[12:25:30] <hamster88> Hello people
[12:25:47] <cjohnson> that's kind of funny robertmaxrees
[12:25:49] <cjohnson> redirect.HA
[12:26:05] <BillCriswell> It laughed at you.
[12:26:13] <jeffmjack_> I know, it made me feel bad :(
[12:26:28] <jeffmjack_> the weird thing is I'm in a big office building
[12:26:33] <jeffmjack_> I don't think it's on uverse :/
[12:26:50] <matthewk> BillCriswell: i will take a look now
[12:26:50] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[12:27:13] <jeffmjack_> also... it's working in incognito mode
[12:27:19] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ are you using a company-supplied laptop?
[12:27:22] <jeffmjack_> no
[12:27:32] <jeffmjack_> and I've made jsfiddles from here before
[12:27:32] <robertmaxrees> clear out your cache and stuff then.
[12:27:35] <robertmaxrees> see if that works.
[12:27:44] <jeffmjack_> yeah how do I do that for just one site?
[12:27:47] <jeffmjack_> nevermind i'll google
[12:27:54] <cjohnson> could just be a cached redirect yeah
[12:28:03] <matthewk> BillCriswell: thanks, i did something similar and used href, src, action (considering form actions)
[12:28:42] <matthewk> it's just problematic to catch everything, and wished <base> was working with modern browsers as i'd expect with jquery load
[12:29:28] <BillCriswell> I'm confused on why it wouldn't.
[12:29:36] <robertmaxrees> what isn't working with .load()?
[12:30:09] <robertmaxrees> the URL it's pulling from?
[12:30:11] <matthewk> because <base> wasn't created with the modern web in mind
[12:30:22] <b0t> Hellooo
[12:30:30] <BillCriswell> Apparently loading html with relative links through .load ignore <base>.
[12:30:41] <b0t> I need replace text !
[12:31:06] <matthewk> taking the response from load and putting it into a container on the main page, the content's relative paths don't follow <base> href that's in place.
[12:31:12] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[12:31:44] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure the URLs aren't incorrectly formatted in the response?
[12:31:49] <robertmaxrees> because that sounds off to me.
[12:32:19] <robertmaxrees> b0t .replace()
[12:32:20] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Agreed.
[12:32:25] <jeffmjack_> Can somebody tell me why this is not injecting stuff? http://jsfiddle.net/r4ceoekx/
[12:32:27] <b0t> No workk
[12:32:38] <robertmaxrees> b0t that's not helpful.  show an example.
[12:32:44] <BillCriswell> b0t: foo.innerHTML = foo.innerHTML.replace()
[12:32:50] <matthewk> robertmaxrees: yes, they show as 404 in firebug.
[12:33:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?  how do urls show as 404s?
[12:34:05] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ $(result).find('.result .userName a'); smells to me.
[12:34:33] <robertmaxrees> var answererElem = result.find('.result .userName a'); - this should work just fine.
[12:34:33] <b0t> Http://pastie.org/9770647
[12:34:33] <b0t> There is my code
[12:34:46] <BillCriswell> b0t: You're not even trying.
[12:34:47] <b0t> I need replace and parse url inside divs
[12:35:00] <jeffmjack_> robertmaxrees: cool... lemme chew on it for a bit :)
[12:35:01] <robertmaxrees> b0t that's not how you do that.
[12:35:25] <b0t> Ok tell me how
[12:35:31] <robertmaxrees> use .prop() to edit the src.
[12:36:55] <cjohnson> $(this).html().replace(/https?\:/, '')  will probably give you what you want b0t
[12:37:06] <b0t> One moment
[12:37:13] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:37:28] <cjohnson> he has <div class="youtube">http://youtube.com/whatever</div>
[12:37:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd just edit the property if possible, but whatevs.
[12:37:34] <cjohnson> or he did when he asked this question 3 hours ago
[12:37:38] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:38:00] <robertmaxrees> use .text() if you want to edit text imo.
[12:38:01] <b0t> No work
[12:38:06] <b0t> Youre code
[12:38:12] <robertmaxrees> b0t setup a working fiddle if you want more help.
[12:38:25] <robertmaxrees> we can't see the html.
[12:38:38] <b0t> Ok one moment
[12:38:48] <b0t> What is a page to put codes?
[12:38:55] <b0t> Css,html and java
[12:39:03] <robertmaxrees> *javascript
[12:39:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:39:07] <b0t> Ok
[12:39:14] <jeffmjack_> robertmaxrees: that doesn't seem to be the problem http://jsfiddle.net/r4ceoekx/2/
[12:39:45] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ can you setup an actual test case?
[12:40:06] <checkit> Is anyone familiar with bootstrap-slider.js? I'm having trouble updatind the slider by editing the numberControl field.... http://jsfiddle.net/1mkph66g/
[12:40:14] <jeffmjack_> yeah, it's a bunch of code though, from an ajax request
[12:40:26] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ i need a small test case.
[12:40:27] <cjohnson> b0t: doesn't work because youtube won't allow its page to load cross-domain, but the code itself works here: http://jsfiddle.net/e0dqss1q/
[12:40:29] <jeffmjack_> k
[12:40:33] <cjohnson> def need more details from you if you want to figure it out
[12:40:34] <robertmaxrees> with just the relevant html.
[12:41:15] <b0t> Yessss
[12:41:23] <b0t> And now replace watch?v= for "" (nothing)
[12:41:44] <BillCriswell> Oy
[12:41:45] <b0t> Sorry, for embed
[12:44:03] <b0t> Http://jsfiddle.net/e0dqss1q/
[12:44:29] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ i see the issue :)
[12:44:49] <jeffmjack_> oh what is it?
[12:45:02] <jeffmjack_> I was setting up a test item :)
[12:45:06] <robertmaxrees> .find('.result .userName a'); - .result isn't a child of the result.
[12:45:14] <robertmaxrees> it's the result itself.  drop that part from your selector.
[12:45:17] <robertmaxrees> just .username a
[12:45:28] <robertmaxrees> and don't pass result to the jquery contructor again
[12:45:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r4ceoekx/5/\
[12:46:02] <robertmaxrees> it's already a jquery object - no need to incur the performance hit of getting a new object back out.
[12:46:45] <jeffmjack_> robertmaxrees: nice.  that was it!
[12:46:54] <jeffmjack_> thanks!!!
[12:46:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:48:15] <robertmaxrees> b0t so what are you trying to do herE?
[12:48:46] <b0t> No, one moment
[12:49:15] <jeffmjack_> ok so just use result.find for injecting more data, you mean? and not using $(result).find?
[12:49:22] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ correct.
[12:49:26] <robertmaxrees> you already have a jquery object.
[12:49:29] <robertmaxrees> no need to get it.
[12:49:41] <jeffmjack_> cool.  yeah I had added that as an act of desperation before I came here ;)
[12:49:48] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[12:50:14] <robertmaxrees> i usually prepend my jquery variable names with $ to flag what's already been passed through and what hasn't
[13:07:54] <b0t> Http://jsfiddle.net/6L31q3te/1/
[13:07:56] <b0t> Yeahhhhhhh

[13:19:21] <matthewk> ï¿½ï¿½ how to remove these characters that look like a question mark in a black diamond?
[13:19:36] <matthewk> i'm seeing a few of them in the response from the jquery load
[13:20:14] <matthewk> i switched from using .load to using .ajax, so to supply contentType: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8", but this didn't fix it
[13:22:35] <b0t> matthewk::: Bad encoded
[13:22:52] <matthewk> ?
[13:24:10] <b0t> Http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1488866/how-to-replace-%C3%AF-%C2%BD-in-a-string
[13:25:39] <b0t> U+00bd = ½ = \u00bd
[13:27:23] <snover> matthewk: contentType property is already that by default, and is for outgoing data, not incoming data
[13:27:39] <snover> your server is returning data that is not utf8
[13:27:42] <snover> fix your server
[13:28:34] <cjohnson> it could be a spoon full of coffee
[13:28:53] <cjohnson> oh haha I was wondering how howlin wolf spontaneously came up in this channel but it was in the fiddle I pasted
[13:45:55] <ThePendulum> Hey. In jquery/js, is there a way to delay a script for a bit? I'm writing a bot in a chat and it looks a bit odd for AI to reply immediately
[13:46:57] <cjohnson> setTimeout
[13:47:04] <cjohnson> it's async though
[14:17:12] <snrmwg> i'm trying to create my first (mobile) UI widget. i want to use a nested widget. tried it with embedded '<div data-role="...">...</div' but that one doesn't get created. what am I missing or what's the correct way to do it? thanks a lot in advace.
[14:21:43] <cjohnson> not familiar so I doubt I'll be helpful snrmwg
[14:21:50] <cjohnson> but paste the code you're working with to jsfiddle
[14:21:52] <cjohnson> to demonstrate your issue
[14:37:52] <pantsofchocolate> weird question i dont know if it is django or jquery
[14:38:43] <pantsofchocolate> django is returning a datetime object to my datepicker and it is kind of screwing it up, the datepicker has the date as  2014-12-9 so it looks like the year nine, does this have to be change in the datepicker itself?
[14:39:15] <LessonsByConnor_> Quick question: Let's say I have a navbar underneath a header, spanning the width of the page. I want to make it so that scrolling past that navbar to where the navbar is at the top of the screen triggers a change to where the navbar is "stuck to the top of the screen" (can't remember the name of that property). What approach should I take?
[14:39:55] <cjohnson> pantsofchocolate: it's easy to tell. look at the rendered source
[14:40:08] <cjohnson> is the value using that format in view source? if so, it's coming from the backend
[14:40:35] <ur5us> Using jQuery 2.1.1, I'm doing an ajax request using $.ajax(..., dataType: 'json', ...) and the response is a 302 redirect. How can I get access to that? So far I tried success, error, done, fail, statusCode: { 302: ...} and only the error callback was hit but that's wrong
[14:41:24] <pantsofchocolate> well its passing it a datetime object which i am assuming jquery cant figure it out
[14:42:01] <cjohnson> what do you mean it's passing it a datetime object?
[14:42:08] <cjohnson> look at the *rendered* source
[14:42:22] <cjohnson> it should be obvious exactly what the input is getting
[14:43:25] <shoky> ur5us: browsers follow redirects automatically, if allowed. maybe you're redirecting to a different origin?  https to http ?
[14:44:00] <ur5us> yes, redirect to a payment gateway, and yes, going from http to https
[14:44:14] <ur5us> but the browser just does nothing
[14:44:23] <pantsofchocolate> datetime is an object created by django and a way to save in the database the value being pushed is datetime(2014,12,1) so its coming out as 2014-12-01 as a mm-dd-yyyy value
[14:44:26] <shoky> which browser
[14:45:01] <ur5us> shoky: Firefox dev edition
[14:45:23] <shoky> ur5us: try chrome and you'll probably see an error in the console about it
[14:45:28] <cjohnson> pantsofchocolate: and you verified this by viewing the source?
[14:45:31] <cjohnson> it's giving yout
[14:45:39] <cjohnson> <input value="2014-12-01"  ?
[14:45:41] <shoky> ur5us: and it's not doing nothing, it's calling your error callback, you said
[14:45:59] <ur5us> yep, which is surprising to me
[14:46:19] <ur5us> shoky: btw, the ajax request is a POST if that matters
[14:46:54] <pantsofchocolate> yea that is what the input has
[14:47:15] <shoky> don't think it matters here. anyways you either have a cross-origin error, or the http to https is causing it. see what chrome says
[14:47:25] <cjohnson> so what is the problem exactly? when you pick a date with the date picker it's giving you the wrong format?
[14:48:09] <ur5us> shoky: ok, will try
[14:48:33] <pantsofchocolate> i think i just have to convert the datetime object in python because jquery doesnt know what it is
[14:48:46] <pantsofchocolate> so it was starting at year 1 since it was on december 1st
[14:49:07] <cjohnson> I don't see how it's a python problem if the python is generating the correct date
[14:49:11] <cjohnson> as you verified in the view source
[14:49:26] <pantsofchocolate> but its not in the correct order i guess?
[14:49:30] <pantsofchocolate> like 2014-12-01
[14:49:36] <pantsofchocolate> should be 12/01/2014
[14:49:50] <cjohnson> 2014-12-01 is generally the correct format
[14:49:55] <pantsofchocolate> i changed the datepickerformat but this is editting a form so it is different right since the value is prepopulated
[14:50:06] <cjohnson> I guess I'm lost
[14:50:11] <cjohnson> I don't know what the problem is exactly
[14:50:25] <cjohnson> sounds like you're conflating javascript (which runs in the client side only) and django (which is a server side framework)
[14:50:38] <cjohnson> there is no such concept as a "datetime" in the browser
[14:50:42] <pantsofchocolate> exactly
[14:51:06] <ur5us> shoky: nothing happens in Chrome, it just stops as FF does
[14:51:19] <cjohnson> so if the python is outputting the date correctl into the <input value (as you verified with view source) then it would like something else is causing the problem
[14:51:26] <cjohnson> but I don't really know what you're experiencing
[14:51:42] <shoky> ur5us: no error in the console?
[14:51:55] <ur5us> shoky: actually it does give me an error.
[14:52:19] <ur5us> shoky: XMLHttpRequest cannot load ... No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource
[14:52:47] <pantsofchocolate> its giving me a correct date but the format is off for the datepicker, so it is perceiving 2014-02-01 as the date 12/02/01, so its seeing it as a completely different date 2000 years off. its just a formatting issue i have to deal with in the backend i guess
[14:52:49] <ur5us> shoky: so I assume the browser tries to resolve the redirect automatically and that fails, hence error callback
[14:53:45] <ur5us> shoky: I assume that means I should return a JSON response with data containing a redirect URL and just do it manually then
[14:54:46] <ur5us> shoky: or do you know of any way how I can actually convince the browser to redirect using location.replace(...) semantics instead of redirecting the POST ajax request
[14:54:48] <ur5us> ?
[14:56:59] <shoky> ur5us: that error means you're doing an ajax request to a different origin, and the server doesn't explicitly support that (via CORS headers)
[14:57:23] <ur5us> shoky: yes, I understand that
[14:57:57] <ur5us> shoky: though, originally, I'm hitting my own server which responds with a redirect
[14:57:59] <cjohnson> pantsofchocolate: hard to say without you actually giving details about what's happening
[14:58:11] <cjohnson> as I said, according to you, you already verified that the backend is working correctly
[14:58:27] <ur5us> shoky: I didn't know that a browser will follow the redirect for ajax requests but it makes sense
[14:58:31] <shoky> ur5us: yeah and the browser tries to follow, nothing you can do about that
[14:59:19] <ur5us> shoky: thanks for your help, it helped to talk it though with somebody
[15:22:42] <guzzlefry> Is Modernizr still worth using?
[15:24:53] <guzzlefry> 42KB of code seems a bit much to check if the client has geolocation API support. :/
[15:25:15] <robertmaxrees> you can do a custom build.
[15:25:18] <snover> nobody can answer your first question
[15:25:35] <guzzlefry> yeah, was a rather vague one.
[15:28:24] <guzzlefry> oh derp, if (!navigator.geolocation)
[15:28:41] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:48:27] <guzzlefry> The callback for failure on navigator.geolocation.getCurrentLocation() isn't firing. 0.o
[16:01:06] <guzzlefry> Any ideas on this? I added the timeout to options, still nothing.
[16:04:57] <guzzlefry> Yay, seems to be a firefox bug.
[16:11:11] <guzzlefry> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=675533
[16:13:08] <guzzlefry> So, this makes things much more difficult...

[16:35:46] <blackhajime> i want to validate field on next button clicked
[17:15:16] <d4rklit3> how does jqueries data function assign data to the element
[17:15:23] <d4rklit3> it doesn't have to be a string right?
[17:15:46] <robertmaxrees> it can be almost anything, but I'd be careful how much/how complicated you make it
[17:15:49] <d4rklit3> nvm.. im dumb it totally doesn't
[17:15:58] <d4rklit3> i want to add an instance of TimelinaMAx
[17:51:25] <MXBrandon> if I have 2 js files included on a page, and in one js file I have this:          $(document).ready(function () { var foo='bar'; }           where is the foo variable stored in?   If I try to reference it in the second js file by using     alert(window.foo);     it is undefined
[17:54:42] <wolfy1339> yes because it's foo not window.foo
[18:02:15] <d4rklit3> well apparently i cant set the data
[18:02:18] <d4rklit3> to be a timelinema
[18:05:25] <d4rklit3> perhaps svg data
[18:05:32] <d4rklit3> svg elements' dont take data

[18:11:44] <wolfy1339> that contains specified text, example: +
[18:12:16] <Woet> wolfy1339: what did you google for?
[18:12:33] <wolfy1339> google?
[18:12:55] <Woet> wolfy1339: well, yes, obviously you have tried to solve it yourself first I assume?
[18:13:21] <wolfy1339> i have looked at .find() documentation
[18:14:36] <Woet> wolfy1339: okay, now combine it with .each and .text
[18:14:43] <Woet> and .addClass
[18:15:05] <wolfy1339> i've found a better way, :contains()
[18:33:17] <Laban> Hello!

[19:08:07] <TreyO_o> Hey awesome jquery folks I'm having a fun issue with my smooth scrolling - it has a top fixed navbar and the first time you click a link from the position of scrolled all the way up it scrolls down as if the navbar was not there
[19:08:23] <TreyO_o> any link you click after that it accounts for my navbar height as it should everytime according to my code
[19:08:34] <TreyO_o> unless I scroll back to the top of the page
[19:08:35] <TreyO_o> any ideas?
[19:10:49] <TreyO_o> http://pastebin.com/gVew0S2n
[19:10:53] <TreyO_o> the code for my smoothscrolling
[19:46:52] <slacko253281> TreyO_o: Your second control group is missing the tab-pane class, which seems to have jumped to where the 3rd one should be.

[22:48:53] <Ayub_> can some one help me with jquery template ?
[22:50:25] <Ayub_> ${name} outputs an empty space when using the jquery template in a JSF page on portal. However it works in normal html page
[22:51:04] <Ayub_> I have debugged it and found that the data indeed has variable name in it
[22:51:55] <Ayub_> the template is being executed and I can see that it rendering the correct number of rows..only thing is its not processing the tags with $
[22:56:49] <GoSox_> can jquery make http requests to documents that are on different subdomains of the same primary domain? like, a scripts on www.example.com loading a document on shared.example.com ?
[22:57:05] <GoSox_> i know there are tight rules about that sort of thing
[22:57:18] <Ayub_> GlSox: yes
[22:57:55] <Ayub_> GlSox: I used $.ajax to submit requests
[22:58:06] <Ayub_> GlSox:set this param $.support.cors = true;
[22:58:43] <GoSox_> im assuming you are talking to me
[22:58:55] <Ayub_> GoSox: Yes :-) its little tricky to handle the reponse though..
[22:59:42] <Ayub_> sorry I had a typo while using the nick
[22:59:49] <GoSox_> ok
[23:20:21] <pilgrimish> how can i check if multiple elements exist? iâ€™m using the length property, but getting no resultsâ€¦
[23:20:51] <GoSox_> .find("selector") maybe?
[23:22:31] <pilgrimish> GoSox_: how could i do that in an if statement?
[23:26:15] <Cork> pilgrimish: what exactly are you trying to do?
[23:26:26] <pilgrimish> http://dev.munroe.com/work/10-rittenhouse/
[23:26:53] <pilgrimish> trying to setup a conditional to show arrows around the thumbnails, if there are more than 1
[23:27:27] <pilgrimish> iâ€™ve got the function in there on line 614, but the console isnâ€™t returning anything
[23:27:29] <Cork> pilgrimish: if($('.thumbnails').length > 1) { }
[23:28:20] <jotterbot> hey guys, how do i attach a new zeroclipboard instance to a button returned from an ajax call?
[23:28:33] <pilgrimish> Cork: thatâ€™s essentially whatâ€™s in there, and no dice
[23:28:41] <jotterbot> taking values also from an input returned from an ajax call
[23:28:52] <Cork> pilgrimish: then you need to share more context, cause that is how you do it
[23:30:14] <Cork> pilgrimish: reproducing the problem in a jsfiddle is a good start in self diagnosing your problem
[23:31:01] <pilgrimish> Cork: thanks, i hear you. i think iâ€™m doing it right. just wondering why itâ€™s not firing anything
[23:32:09] <Cork> pilgrimish: the images isn't loaded on page load
[23:32:22] <Cork> you need to wait for the plugin to build the image list
[23:36:18] <Cork> pilgrimish: you have to find a callback for lsjQuery("#layerslider_10").layerSlider
[23:36:27] <Cork> and in that callback do you're check
[23:44:48] <pilgrimish> ok, cbinit is the callbackâ€¦ thanks for that
[23:45:31] <pilgrimish> in the case of varying integers at the end of each id, how would i dynamically target?
[23:50:49] <pilgrimish> i could just call the class
[23:54:11] <pilgrimish> Cork: rockinâ€™, thank you
[23:54:55] <Cork> pilgrimish: you figured out the correct answer on you're own, good on you! :)
[23:55:40] <pilgrimish> gettinâ€™ better and better at this, appreciate you pointing out the callback issue
[23:56:03] <Cork> pilgrimish: well, that is why i'm here, to give you the hints you need to solve the problem
[23:57:16] <jotterbot> i have a process question. Suppose I want to have a dynamic template that is "rendered" every click of a button (think mustacheJS/jquery template engine) but retains any data entered into form elements when it is "rerendered".
[23:57:18] <jotterbot> is this possible?
[23:58:28] <jotterbot> if so how do I store the user input, retrieve and reinsert it into the correct dom input elements?
[23:58:57] <Cork> jotterbot: that would be tough
[23:59:28] <Cork> you're best option is to not touch the elements and just replace the rest of the elements
[23:59:50] <Cork> jotterbot: the second best option (by a margin) is to scan through the fields store the values they have
[23:59:55] <Cork> run the template and replace the elements
