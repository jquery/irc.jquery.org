[00:37:15] <prohobo> hey, is it possible to get a list of active event listeners on an element?
[00:37:23] <prohobo> for debugging purposes
[00:38:58] <prohobo> nvm im dumb
[00:42:34] <anli_> Why cant the function on_move_clicked be found in http://jsfiddle.net/4kxn48t8/ ?
[00:42:44] <anli_> (I get an error when I click the button)
[00:43:21] <anli_> oh, wait a second, I know why
[00:43:24] <anli_> Its onload
[00:43:25] <HideMyAss> I need to boost video element audio level. Can anyone please help https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/discuss-webrtc/qgAtJ5415BU
[01:13:32] <Elirips> Hello. What happens to a waiting ajax call if the scripts wants to navigate away from the page? Say: I have a $.ajax call, that is beeing held by the server for some time. Minewhile the script decides to assign a new location to the doc. Do I need to terminate the call first, or will the browser do that automatically?
[01:14:02] <Cork> Elirips: the connection gets aborted
[01:14:27] <Elirips> Cork: By the browser? By all browsers?
[01:14:48] <Cork> Elirips: as the page unloads outstanding requests gets aborted
[01:14:51] <Cork> not just ajax ones
[01:15:01] <Cork> and yes this is expected behavior in all browsers
[01:19:10] <prohobo> is there a way i can create an event listener that fires when an option is added to a select?
[01:19:26] <prohobo> im trying to use livequery but it isn't recognizing new options
[01:20:19] <prohobo> livequery only seems to work when an object is actually added/removed from the DOM
[01:20:20] <Cork> prohobo: not cross browsers no
[01:20:24] <prohobo> crap
[01:20:55] <prohobo> hmm
[01:21:00] <Cork> there was a dom modification event, but it was deprecated cause it has horrible performance effects
[01:21:17] <Cork> and it has been replaced with mustation observers
[01:21:25] <Cork> but none of those has been implemented in all browsers
[01:21:30] <prohobo> :\
[01:21:42] <prohobo> so, there's nothing i can do?
[01:21:50] <Cork> prohobo: your best option is to have the code that adds the option call a function you define
[01:21:54] <Cork> to notify you of the update
[01:22:22] <prohobo> hm ye, i think i'll have to create a work around because there are 3 ways of adding an option to the select\
[01:22:38] <prohobo> and the script for that is by a different author
[01:22:57] <prohobo> i dont want to edit the script, so i guess i'll have to add event listeners for buttons/double clicks
[01:23:31] <Cork> that doesn't really sound like a work around to be honest :)
[01:23:46] <Cork> it sounds like the "right approach"
[01:24:58] <prohobo> lol
[01:25:16] <prohobo> Cork, with javascript it feels like everything i do is a hack
[01:25:46] <prohobo> i think i just have bad coding form in JS
[01:28:43] <Elirips> Cork: and is that "abort" of the ajax-call also done if I do not store a reference in my javascript to the ajax call? For example if I simply do $.ajax(..); instead of 'var a = $.ajax(..);'?
[01:29:23] <Cork> Elirips: if the page unloads:, yes, if it doesn't no
[01:29:52] <Cork> Elirips: meaning if connections is aborted or not has nothing to do with js
[01:31:56] <Elirips> Cork: Hmm.. I'm asking this cause I got some "confusing" behaviour: If I click on a button that does a 'document.location.assign(url);' I see that the browser will quickly contact the new server at url, then it waits for a few seconds for the old server, until it starts loading the new url
[01:32:11] <Elirips> Cork: And I thought this cuold be because I still might have pending ajax requests
[01:32:39] <Cork> Elirips: i doubt quite a bit it waits for the old server
[01:32:52] <Elirips> Cork: Or do I need to do something special to really "unload" the page? Is a document.location.assign not enough?
[01:33:42] <Elirips> Cork: Well, its hard to tell exactly whats going on: I see for exapmle that chrome will tell in the left bottom corner "wait for new url" for a few millisecs, then "wait for old url" for some seconds, then "wait for new url" again
[01:33:48] <Cork> Elirips: just do window.location = newLocation;
[01:34:10] <Elirips> Cork: whats the difference between window.location and document.location.assign ?
[01:34:34] <Cork> Elirips: mainly that noone uses .assign :)
[01:34:56] <Cork> it might have a special check, i don't know
[01:35:00] <Cork> can't say i've ever used it
[01:35:28] <Elirips> Cork: okay thank you.
[01:35:50] <Elirips> I'll try on first with the debug / network tools to figure out what it is waiting for
[01:57:56] <Vitgije> Hello guys, I need help with a function i made
[02:25:47] <NETim_> morning. Trying to check if a var is an object/array.
[02:26:02] <NETim_> what's the best way. (or any method actually).
[02:28:44] <d0de> if (typeOf(var)==='array' || typeOf(var)==='object') {} ?
[02:29:14] <NETim_> d0de, Tried that, no joy.
[02:29:31] <NETim_> also, typeOf is not defined?
[02:29:59] <d0de> NET_im_ can you post your code in a fiddle?
[02:30:11] <NETim_> for some reason, when it hits the variable that is an object, it sees it as a string, not an object.
[02:30:18] <NETim_> Will put together a fiddle.
[02:34:22] <Elirips> I'm still wondering what slows down the navigation of my page: Now I've found that inside a window.onunload function the javascript sends a XMLHttpRequest to the server, using 'GET'. Could that prevent the browser from actually leaving the page?
[02:37:03] <NETim_> d0de, almost got the fiddle working. It's not liking .replace for some reason. Works in my code but not in jsfiddle.
[02:38:37] <tlz> hello all
[02:39:10] <tlz> I have a selector problem. Beginner question.....
[02:39:51] <NETim_> Right, d0de, heres the fiddle:
[02:39:52] <NETim_> http://jsfiddle.net/rkfxdgom/12/
[02:40:35] <NETim_> the Materials position in the first process is an object, yet it doesn't seem to be able to tell when looping/
[02:43:10] <bloodyscythe> tlz, if you don't clearify your problem, noone can help you
[02:43:12] <tlz> I have 2 tables. In the second one, I have a link. I want to fire jquery on that link and select the table BEFORE that table. http://jsfiddle.net/syddmxfn/
[02:43:30] <tlz> soory it took so long ;-)
[02:43:34] <no_gravity> Is there an elegant js or jquery way tell an element "fade out and when completely faded out, set display to none"?
[02:44:31] <tlz> sorry wrong jsfiddle
[02:44:34] <tlz> this one: http://jsfiddle.net/syddmxfn/1/
[02:45:11] <bloodyscythe> first of, it's not $this, it's $(this)
[02:45:21] <tlz> im such a noob
[02:45:36] <tlz> @ gravity: here I gogled it for you http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8207897/jquery-waiting-for-the-fadeout-to-complete-before-running-fadein
[02:45:38] <d0de> no_gravity, $(element).fadeOut( 'slow', function() { $(element).hide() } );
[02:46:09] <no_gravity> d0de: looks good. let me try...
[02:46:45] <saso_> Hy guys! I have one question! I am using draggable function for dragging elements and droping them on one droppable place. When I hover on element, it should make an animation first (transform translate) and when i start dragging it, it should remain translated. But because it's hover event is over (i think) it jump back to default (non-transform-translated) position. Do you have any idea how should i solve that? My elements structure is ul li div div.draggab
[02:46:45] <saso_> le <- this .draggable should have a hover effect
[02:47:28] <d0de> no_gravity, replace 'slow' with any number of ms you like
[02:48:54] <bloodyscythe> tlz, does it work now?
[02:49:19] <tlz> nope, I just try and error:  $( this ).filter("table:parent").css( "background", "yellow" );
[02:49:40] <no_gravity> d0de: unfortunately with many elements, that does not run smoothly. setting the style of the element to opacity:0 and transient time to some value is smooth.
[02:49:49] <bloodyscythe> what about $(this).closest("table").css("background", "yellow") ?
[02:51:49] <tlz> closest() is not what I want http://jsfiddle.net/syddmxfn/3/
[02:53:47] <bloodyscythe> tlz, http://jsfiddle.net/syddmxfn/7/ like that?
[02:54:13] <d0de> NETim_, I didn't realize this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12996871/why-does-typeof-array-with-objects-return-object-and-not-array
[02:54:39] <tlz> I cannot work with IDs, because I dont want to edit the jquery each time I add a new table
[02:54:50] <bloodyscythe> oh okay
[02:55:11] <tlz> thats why I try to get the table before my link
[02:55:29] <NETim_> d0de, interesting. However, the issue that I have is that typeof seems to think that my object is a string.
[02:55:30] <tlz> DRY is the slogan, right?
[02:56:09] <bloodyscythe> http://jsfiddle.net/syddmxfn/8/
[02:56:23] <saso_> Does anyone have a clue how should i solve that? :S
[02:56:47] <bloodyscythe> tlz, http://jsfiddle.net/syddmxfn/9/ or that
[02:57:14] <bloodyscythe> nvm, without .last()
[02:58:04] <bloodyscythe> sorry for so many pastes http://jsfiddle.net/syddmxfn/10/
[02:58:13] <tlz> np
[02:58:29] <bloodyscythe> is that what you wanted?
[02:59:02] <tlz> yes, this I like $(this).closest("table").prev().css( "background", "yellow" );
[02:59:33] <tlz> talk me trough. $t closest table select my parent table wich I click in? right?
[02:59:34] <bloodyscythe> but it's always the table BEFORE the one you clicked the link in
[03:00:08] <tlz> exactly: >I want to fire jquery on that link and select the table BEFORE that table.
[03:00:57] <tlz> how does prev() knew that it has to select the table before and not any other element?
[03:01:02] <bloodyscythe> $(this) is the a element, .closest("table") searches for the table tag which is closest to the $(this) element, .prev() searches for the previous to your selected element (the table)
[03:01:32] <tlz> so if there is an h1 inbetween the tables, it will select h1
[03:01:52] <bloodyscythe> it will select the table before the table you are referring to
[03:02:14] <bloodyscythe> wait...
[03:02:21] <tlz> no, it select the element before that
[03:02:30] <tlz> http://jsfiddle.net/syddmxfn/11/
[03:06:45] <tlz> hey I have to leave, but Im on the right track. THX a LOT!!!
[03:06:52] <tlz> maybe I get back to you
[03:10:12] <NETim_> d0de, sorted it, was getting really turned around with where the object actually is at each point in the loops. (there is another level of loopiness in the actual code)
[03:11:04] <bloodyscythe> http://jsfiddle.net/syddmxfn/13/
[03:11:17] <bloodyscythe> tlz,
[03:14:03] <bloodyscythe> imo some outdated stuff should be removed from learn.jquery.com or at least marked as outdated
[03:18:24] <greenit> hi, i have a problem with jquery in IE 8... it doesn't support .keyup() , but i need this function
[03:18:30] <greenit> can you help me?
[03:18:43] <Cork> greenit: that statement isn't correct
[03:21:16] <greenit> Cork: why does my IE 8 then tell me that ".keyup() is no function" ?
[03:21:37] <Cork> greenit: most likely cause the object you run it on isn't a jquery object
[03:22:19] <greenit> Cork: oh, just recognized it before you wrote it, i added "$.noConflict();" and now it works
[03:36:30] <greenit> can you help me with the following script? IE 8 says that "this object does not support this property or method" http://jsfiddle.net/05cddgu2/  ... I am pretty new to javascript and don't know how i can change it so that IE8+ and all other browser behave the same way... it works in firefox and chrome
[03:37:03] <Cork> greenit: don't use keypress
[03:37:12] <Cork> it is deprecated AND not cross browser
[03:37:17] <Cork> use keydown
[03:37:31] <Cork> or possibly input (depending on what you want to do)
[03:38:02] <greenit> Cork: ok, do you see any other possible problem in this script? My purpose is to change enter-key to tab-key
[03:38:11] <greenit> problems*
[03:38:27] <Cork> what method is it complaining about?
[03:38:52] <Cork> btw return event.keyCode; makes no sense
[03:38:55] <greenit> line 2, column 3, so i think about the $('form')
[03:39:20] <Cork> then make sure :)
[03:40:15] <greenit> the script i wrote there is the whole script, so it compains about $('form') ;)
[03:40:47] <Cork> greenit: start by doing something like alert($('form').length)
[03:40:53] <Cork> before the rest of the code
[03:41:09] <Cork> (but inside the ready wrapper)
[03:41:30] <greenit> ok
[03:47:23] <greenit> well, it tells me that this object doesn't support this method "alert($('form').length)"...
[03:48:13] <Cork> greenit: and alert('hello');
[03:48:13] <Cork> ?
[03:49:02] <Cork> greenit: note that line numbers often lie in older ie (pre ie9)
[03:49:16] <greenit> Cork: oh, i forgot the semicolon :S form-length is 1
[03:49:28] <Cork> ok
[03:49:35] <Cork> greenit: start commenting out the script
[03:49:40] <Cork> until it runs
[03:49:56] <Cork> then add it back section by section until you find exactly what breaks it
[03:50:34] <greenit> ok, thx, i'll write again if i found the error or i don't know what to do  ;)
[03:55:42] <greenit> Cork: ok, the "keyCode" was the problem, but as you said "return event.keyCode;" makes no sense, does "return event;" make more sense?
[03:55:54] <Cork> no
[03:55:57] <Cork> what is it you want to do?
[03:56:16] <greenit> transform an enter-keypress to a tab-keypress
[03:56:29] <Cork> you can't really do that
[03:56:40] <greenit> hm.... that's bad :(
[03:56:58] <Cork> you can stop the event and fake the action you want
[03:57:14] <greenit> how?
[03:57:26] <Cork> that is the big question :)
[03:58:13] <Cork> you could do something like var fields = $(this).find(':input'); fields.eq(fields.index(event.target) + 1).focus() i guess
[03:58:25] <Cork> greenit: though you shouldn't mess with how form navigation works
[03:58:44] <Cork> it will most likely break accessibility, user expectation and a lot of other quite bad things
[03:59:14] <greenit> well, it already breask user-expectation as it presses the submit-button when they press enter
[03:59:21] <greenit> breaks*
[03:59:30] <Cork> greenit: no, that is expected behavior
[03:59:47] <greenit> from the form, yes; from the users, nope... that's my problem ;)
[03:59:50] <Cork> enter in a form, except in a textarea submits the form
[04:00:24] <Cork> greenit: you could bind a submit event handler and ask for confirmation before submitting the form
[04:00:37] <Cork> greenit: cause yes, enter in a form, from the view of the user
[04:00:40] <Cork> submit is expected
[04:00:51] <Cork> all none broken web forms work like that
[04:01:06] <greenit> ok
[04:01:11] <Cork> and like i said accessibility tools expect this
[04:01:22] <Cork> (like voiceover)
[04:02:25] <litropy> Is fading in an element (opacity) while also animating its position more processor intensive than only animating the element's position?
[04:02:31] <litropy> Furthermore, does moving an element faster load processors more?
[04:02:35] <greenit> well, one more question: how can i prevent the keydown-event to trigger when the user holds down backspace? openfaces has a built-in mini-dos when you hold down the backspace and i can't easily change the framework....
[04:02:43] <Cork> litropy: yes
[04:02:53] <litropy> Cork, on both accounts?
[04:02:59] <Cork> litropy: moving anything that has opacity is more cpu intensive
[04:03:14] <tlz> I have the feeling that this can be reduced to the max: $(this).closest("table").prevAll("table").first().css( "background", "yellow" ); http://jsfiddle.net/syddmxfn/13/
[04:03:29] <Cork> cause the computer has to calculate how the colors composits
[04:03:35] <litropy> Cork, and what of an animation's speed?
[04:03:38] <tlz> GPU intesive? @cork?
[04:03:54] <litropy> tlz, that's dependent on the architecture
[04:03:56] <Cork> tlz: depends on the hardware
[04:04:09] <Cork> but yes, cpu or cpu+gpu
[04:04:24] <tlz> what about mobiles?
[04:04:30] <Cork> same
[04:04:41] <Cork> though there it is mostly the later
[04:04:42] <litropy> tlz, usually gpu+cpu with mobile
[04:04:52] <Cork> cause the cpu on moile is too week to do it on it's own
[04:05:10] <Cork> litropy: not sure what the question is
[04:06:40] <litropy> Cork, is $.animate({some positional css}, 200) more processor intensive than $.animate({some positional css}, 1000)?
[04:07:16] <litropy> Cork, I'm developing for mobile, and am trying to cut down on animation jumpiness (PU overload)
[04:07:31] <Cork> litropy: not really
[04:07:44] <Cork> $.animate is more costly then css transition though
[04:07:56] <litropy> Cork, of course.
[04:08:04] <Cork> litropy: $.animate isn't gpu accelerated
[04:08:17] <litropy> Cork, oooh, wow.
[04:08:24] <litropy> That's a shame.
[04:08:27] <Cork> the higher number you set the more steps it needs to trigger for
[04:08:34] <Cork> (in $.animate)
[04:08:43] <Cork> so the more code needs to be executed
[04:08:47] <prohobo> it'd only be more CPU intensive if it takes nearly 200ms to animate
[04:08:50] <prohobo> right?
[04:08:55] <prohobo> then overhead
[04:09:12] <Cork> the heigher number is more costly then the low
[04:09:31] <Cork> but for 200ms of time they are the same
[04:09:33] <tlz> what about FPS?
[04:09:39] <litropy> Cork, but in temrs of smoothness, it doesn't really matter
[04:09:40] <litropy> ?
[04:09:43] <litropy> terms*
[04:09:45] <Cork> has nothing to do with $.animate
[04:09:49] <Cork> no
[04:10:05] <Cork> litropy: if you want smoothness you could patch $.animate to use requestAnimationFrame
[04:10:27] <Cork> then it will run the code every frame that needs to be rendered
[04:10:34] <Cork> instead of in a random "tick"
[04:10:41] <Cork> that $.animate uses by default
[04:10:44] <litropy> Cork, interesting.
[04:10:52] <litropy> Cork, what's the drawback?
[04:10:54] <Cork> (thanks slideshow developers!)
[04:11:09] <Cork> litropy: if you expect every frame to be a fixed number of ms
[04:11:12] <Cork> it will break
[04:11:16] <Cork> (thanks slideshow developers!!)
[04:11:37] <Cork> litropy: side note, jquery had support for requestAnimationFrame
[04:11:56] <Cork> but was forced to back out cause all slideshows broke cause they don't know how to do proper animations
[04:12:16] <Cork> well not "all" but a huge amount of them
[04:12:54] <Cork> litropy: setInterval(function() { makeAnimation() }, 5000);
[04:12:55] <litropy> Cork, I'm not firing code during the animation. In fact, I'm returning false for clicks during animations. I wait until after, as in $.animate({some positional css}, 400, function(){after stuff});
[04:13:05] <Cork> if makeAnimation uses requestAnimationFrame
[04:13:22] <Cork> it will queue the animations when the tab goes unfocused
[04:13:29] <Cork> the browser goes to sleep
[04:13:31] <Cork> and so on
[04:13:50] <Cork> so you get a frency of animations when it goes back up (cause setInterval keeps triggering)
[04:14:08] <litropy> Cork, hah, so when I switch back to the tab, it will finish the animation? I actually like that.
[04:14:15] <Cork> so you need to built your animations around actually calculating what time you expect to be in
[04:14:22] <Cork> and what should be shown at that time
[04:14:42] <Cork> litropy: no more like it won't fire the callbacks when the tabs goes unfocused
[04:14:50] <Cork> cause nothing is drown anymore
[04:14:52] <litropy> Cork, ah
[04:14:53] <Cork> so no frames
[04:15:22] <Cork> so if you use requestAnimationFrame you have to thing about animation in its states
[04:15:36] <Cork> instad of "50 ms after this move to px to the right"
[04:15:45] <Cork> *move it two px to the
[04:15:58] <Cork> cause the later will break
[04:16:32] <litropy> Cork, I want to do stepwise, anyway. All my code already waits for animations to complete.
[04:16:44] <Cork> instead of that you need to do "i started at [start unixtime] and is currently as [unixtime] in that time span i should be at px"
[04:17:17] <Cork> cause a tick could be 1ms or 4days
[04:17:29] <litropy> Cork, nah, I just let JS/jQ do its thing and go, "That was amazing! Now do this, too!"
[04:17:57] <Cork> litropy: ya, and that means relying on a tick that isn't ever true
[04:18:06] <Cork> only a best guess
[04:18:14] <Cork> and often completely wrong
[04:18:24] <Cork> and yes causes lag
[04:19:12] <litropy> Cork, wait wait wait. So you're saying complete breaks? $("#mydiv").animate({some positional css}, 400, function(){after stuff that may not work?});
[04:19:25] <Cork> litropy: no
[04:19:48] <Cork> litropy: but if you depend on the complete function to fire at 400ms
[04:19:57] <Cork> and not 500ms or somethign else
[04:20:07] <Cork> then yes your assumption breaks
[04:20:10] <Cork> but it always does
[04:20:43] <litropy> Cork, nah - I don't care how long it takes. Although too much lag is undesirable.
[04:20:47] <Cork> cause it will only be approximately true as long as the cpu has time enough to do the jobs and be done before the next tick
[04:20:59] <Cork> litropy: then requestAnimationFrame should work
[04:21:25] <Cork> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8101
[04:25:30] <litropy> Cork, so setInterval(function() { makeAnimation() }, 5000); is a big no-no
[04:29:01] <litropy> I patch $.animate, use functions like $("#mydiv").animate({some positional css}, 400, function(){ after stuff}); and it should then work? Even if I'm doing step-wise animation, e.g. {after stuff} contains another $.animate?
[04:38:01] <Elirips> Is $.ajax just a shorthand for XMLHttpRequest? Or is this something totally different?
[04:39:52] <litropy> Thanks Cork, this is really working much better.
[04:42:57] <litropy> Elirips, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:43:53] <litropy> Elirips, it seems to differentiate between jqXHR and XMLHTTPRequest. But it's much more. Check that out for more details.
[04:45:49] <litropy> MAn Cork, that's the most dramatic difference in the shortest amount of time I've seen since I began dev on this site. Thanks again!
[04:52:34] <Cork> litropy: sorry was in a meeting
[04:52:45] <Cork> litropy: yes, setInterval is never a good idea
[04:53:12] <Cork> personally i would have liked it deprecated from the standard completely
[04:57:07] <litropy> Cork, yep, definitely working without it. I just love that I didn't have to modify any of my code, dropped in the patch, and voila - nice, smooth animations. Ecept for one stutter, which I think is a huge function that fires during the animation.
[04:57:20] <litropy> I'll just have to do it before.
[04:57:46] <Cork> litropy: ya, requestAnimationFrame is a huge process time saver
[04:58:10] <Cork> as long as you don't except the animation to be ticking like a clock
[04:58:23] <Cork> (and it really shouldn't if you want performance)
[04:58:53] <litropy> Cork, yah I never even thought of that. Don't mess with the magic - let it run its course.
[04:59:35] <Cork> lol
[05:02:31] <litropy> Cork, is requestAnimationFrame supported by Safari or will it fall back? I'm running linux and android, so I can't test it immediately.
[05:02:45] <Cork> ?mdn requestanimationframe
[05:02:47] <b-ot> Cork: requestAnimationFrame - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame
[05:02:53] <Cork> check the compatibility table
[05:12:45] <litropy> thx
[06:08:51] <PV_> hi everyone is it possible to have instead of $(".tooltip-examples a").tooltip({ a indentifier for the whole page?
[06:09:02] <PV_> .body ?
[06:11:23] <BillCriswell> PV_: I image just $('a').tooltip(...) ?
[06:11:39] <BillCriswell> OH defaults.
[06:11:43] <PV_> thank you just found out its just "*" for everything works very nice
[06:12:03] <BillCriswell> PV_: Don't do that.
[06:12:27] <BillCriswell> On a huge page I wouldn't be surprised if that actually blows things up.
[06:13:47] <Omar-> Cork hi
[06:13:57] <BillCriswell> PV_: If you just want to put tooltips on all the links you'd just do: $('a').
[06:14:08] <joshuabud> Anyone from commerce guys that can tell us why the search on your community website isn’t working? I even logged in.
[06:14:28] <BillCriswell> $('*') will select body, html, div, span, a, time, section, article, mark, b, em, etc, etc, etc
[06:14:37] <joshuabud> Sorry wrong window.
[07:42:25] <Haix64> Hi. inside a plugin I'm writing, I wanna access the <a> that's within "this". How should I do it? I mean sth that could be written $("this > a") for example
[07:44:18] <shoky> $(this).find('a')
[07:44:33] <Haix64> shoky: thanks :-)
[07:52:40] <decx> 'this' inside a $.fn.plugin is the whole collection though, do you do a return.each `?
[07:58:27] <alouf> heyall
[07:59:22] <alouf> has the malfunction been reported yet? regarding the 62.207.176.141 host
[07:59:33] <alouf> Apache 2 Test Page
[07:59:33] <alouf> powered by CentOS
[08:06:54] <shoky> huh?
[08:12:03] <alouf> jquery.com
[08:12:17] <alouf> i heard they dosd you a lot.
[08:12:29] <alouf> yesterday, and today i get the apache 2 test page.
[08:12:31] <alouf> just fyi.
[08:12:34] <alouf> <3
[08:56:20] <egp> I’m looking at some code some else wrote: $("li.active", elem).removeClass("active"); where elem is an “#divid” what does the comma syntax do? having issues trying to find what the docs page would be
[08:59:03] <kevin> egp, the second argument is the context of the search: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery1
[08:59:33] <egp> kevin: ahh ok that’s definitely the doc page I was missing
[08:59:37] <egp> kevin: thanks
[09:00:07] <egp> kevin: how did you navigate to that page from the left hand navigation?
[09:00:25] <egp> kevin: oh that’s the waht “Core” ?
[09:00:35] <shoky> yep
[09:00:38] <egp> good to know
[09:02:57] <Bauer> I have this code which works in jquery 1.4.4: http://pastie.org/private/gixb04s7fo9fti1ihboa but in latest 1.11, it executes the error function when the request was 200 OK :S
[09:03:02] <Bauer> I cant figure out why...
[09:03:25] <robertmaxrees> the data coming back might be invalid.
[09:03:48] <shoky> uh dataType: 'post'  seems off.
[09:04:05] <robertmaxrees> that, too.
[09:04:12] <robertmaxrees> probably want type: 'POST'
[09:05:16] <robertmaxrees> ajax can error for more reasons than http codes, either way :)
[09:06:09] <Bauer> robertmaxrees: the same response works fine with 1.4.4, verified
[09:06:16] <shoky> yeah, like if the response mimetype is json, but the body is empty
[09:06:21] <shoky> that'd work in 1.4 but not in 1.9+
[09:06:37] <robertmaxrees> update your datatype and make sure your headers are good, bandroidx
[09:06:41] <robertmaxrees> err, Bauer
[09:06:47] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete!
[09:07:16] <Bauer> Content-Type:text/html; is in the response, do you mean update that?
[09:07:25] <robertmaxrees> fix your datatype option.
[09:07:36] <shoky> Bauer also.. check what the arguments are in the error callback. to see what the error is
[09:07:51] <robertmaxrees> replace it with type: 'POST', instead of dataType: 'post'
[09:09:30] <Bauer> shoky: how? the function is simply: function onAjaxError(){ it has no arguments... and hi btw! :P
[09:09:45] <Bauer> robertmaxrees: I did, still doesnt help
[09:10:24] <shoky> Bauer: give it arguments.  function onAjaxError(xhr, status, error) { console.log('ERROR!', status, error) }
[09:11:29] <shoky> Bauer: and hey ;P
[09:11:44] <Bauer> RROR! parsererror No conversion from text to post
[09:12:01] <Bauer> what the hell that means?
[09:12:04] <shoky> ahh it's you
[09:12:07] <shoky> hey :)
[09:12:20] <Bauer> yeah, we are still alive, somehow :D
[09:12:33] <shoky> :D thankfully, for me
[09:12:36] <shoky> ;p
[09:13:25] <shoky> Bauer that means you still have dataType: 'post'  which is wrong
[09:13:51] <Bauer> shoky: no I do not.. dataType: "POST"
[09:14:02] <robertmaxrees> Bauer that's not correct.
[09:14:06] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid datatype.
[09:14:08] <shoky> same thing dude.  POST is the http request type, NOT the dataType
[09:14:10] <robertmaxrees> you want type: 'POST'
[09:14:31] <shoky> remove the dataType,  or set it to 'html' i guess
[09:14:35] <Bauer> ahh yeah, I have that too, ok one sec
[09:14:42] <Bauer> wasnt sure what it so so I didnt touch :)
[09:15:41] <Bauer> and it works of course now, thanks shoky!  :)
[09:17:42] <destinydriven> hey guys, I'm having an issue with "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access" when I try to run this line of code:  $.get('http://www.google.com/finance/historical?output=csv&q=NASDAQ:GOOGL', function (csvFile)
[09:18:06] <robertmaxrees> Dessimat0r because yopu cannot do that.
[09:18:15] <robertmaxrees> woops autocomplete strikes again!
[09:18:34] <robertmaxrees> destinydriven ^ you can't ajax content from any server you want.
[09:18:59] <robertmaxrees> the ajax call needs to either be on the same domain OR the remove server must explicitly allow it.
[09:19:15] <robertmaxrees> *remote, not remove.
[09:20:53] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, how do I remedy this?
[09:21:35] <robertmaxrees> proxying the request through your own server.
[09:22:24] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, care to explain further?
[09:23:42] <d0de> say that $(this) is $('#id'), is there a way to select $('#id .class') using just $(this) ?
[09:23:57] <robertmaxrees> you need to setup your server so you can tell it what you want, it fetches the data for you, and then sends it back to your page.
[09:24:07] <robertmaxrees> d0de $(this).find('.class');
[09:24:42] <d0de> robertmaxrees, thanks!
[09:25:50] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, do you have a code example?  Or what about using jsonp?
[09:26:39] <shoky> anytime, Bauer ;]
[09:26:53] <robertmaxrees> destinydriven jsonp only works if the remote server supports it.
[09:27:03] <robertmaxrees> i don't really have a full-stack code example for you.
[09:27:14] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, actually this is gonna be run locally
[09:27:27] <robertmaxrees> destinydriven okay.  so you're going to ask your own server for data?
[09:27:42] <robertmaxrees> you should probably read about CORS - that'll help you understand what's up.
[09:28:04] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, I read about setting up some header
[09:29:16] <robertmaxrees> destinydriven CORS is to prevent you from arbitrarily requesting content from other servers on a user's behalf without said remove servers explicitly allowing it.
[09:30:00] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to request content from your own box, you don't need to setup those headers.
[09:30:08] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, thanks I will read up on that but I think my quick fix for now would be to copy that csv file locally and work with it from there.
[09:30:37] <robertmaxrees> destinydriven sure.  serve it up from the same port, protocol, and domain.
[09:30:56] <egp> With something like this: http://jsbin.com/geqiwixu/99/edit where I have multiple on click events, is it always guaranteed that the first click event will trigger before the 2nd?
[09:31:11] <destinydriven> robertmaxrees, thanks again for your time :)
[09:31:19] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[09:31:33] <egp> I see that if I click on the 2nd link, the first even triggers, then the second triggers after that but wasn’t sure if it was a reliable behavior or not
[09:31:51] <robertmaxrees> egp sort of?  there's an event queue that gets used, but I wouldn't rely on it tbh.
[09:32:50] <egp> doh
[09:33:00] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[09:33:38] <egp> I can work around it, just seemed like it was the simplest approach to avoid some refactoring hehe
[09:33:52] <robertmaxrees> erm, what's the isse you're running into?
[09:34:02] <robertmaxrees> because something tells me you want a delegated listener instead..
[09:34:50] <egp> not an issue per say, just being lazy, had some initial on click code, now I’m adding in a new “feature” for a specific type of record that does what the original does, but some extra stuff
[09:35:05] <egp> I just need to have the single event and have some if logic for the various class existance/etc
[09:35:15] <robertmaxrees> then use a delegated listener instead.
[09:36:02] <selectbox> hi, if i have a select box and i want to get the value of the selected option, should i just use .val() on the select element and it will work?
[09:36:27] <robertmaxrees> selectbox on the dropdown entirely, not the specific element, yeah.
[09:37:55] <robertmaxrees> egp http://jsbin.com/fajunoriqufe/1/edit like this.
[09:38:19] <selectbox> is it okay to post a single line of code here?
[09:38:44] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:38:57] <robertmaxrees> as long as it's not something huge.
[09:38:57] <decx> minified jquery incoming
[09:39:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:39:16] <selectbox> beware!!!
[09:39:18] <selectbox> $( "#select_box_id" ).change(function(this){ alert( $(this).val() ); });
[09:39:24] <Alin2k> hello, i want to know if there is someone to help me to save a mp4 movie from a website, i can't find the source of the video, the site is http://masterchef.protv.ro/video/masterchef-sezonul-4-alina-laufer.html
[09:39:35] <robertmaxrees> Alin2k that's not on topic for the room.
[09:39:54] <destinydriven> Alin2k, look for a browser plugin to do that for you
[09:40:00] <robertmaxrees> aaaand we're not really going to help you pirate content :)
[09:40:02] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[09:40:12] <decx> http://assets.sport.ro/assets/protv/2014/09/29/videos/24714/chef/alina laufer.mp4
[09:40:23] <Alin2k> robertmaxrees is just a sequence, a spot
[09:40:36] <Alin2k> decx i found that, but it is not working, i got not foud
[09:40:44] <robertmaxrees> Alin2k i don't care - what you're asking for help with is called piracy, and we're not going to help with that.
[09:40:45] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[09:41:09] <robertmaxrees> i don't really care about people's opinions on the matter.  i don't want to get caught up in it :)
[09:41:16] <decx> but that's the video they link in the script :(
[09:41:34] <robertmaxrees> if y'all want to take it elsewhere, i'd appreciate it :)
[09:41:41] <selectbox> robertmaxrees wanna help me out instead?
[09:41:45] <shoky> selectbox: uhhh never ever do function(this) { .. }
[09:41:59] <selectbox> why?
[09:42:09] <robertmaxrees> because you're rewriting the `this` object
[09:42:10] <shoky> because it's wrong.
[09:42:21] <robertmaxrees> don't pass anything - that should work.
[09:42:44] <selectbox> great, thank you verry much
[09:42:57] <selectbox> good luck fighting jack sparrow
[09:43:05] <robertmaxrees> that argument is usually meant for the event object.
[09:43:17] <robertmaxrees> people usually name it "e" or "event" instead
[09:43:39] <decx> i dont care so i call it eh
[09:43:47] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[09:44:23] <shoky> lol
[09:44:34] <boombadaroomba> I have a method which adds an input field on click. I need to add a remove button to it and have it remove imput field using jquery. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Looking for links or things to read.
[09:44:47] <BillCriswell> I used to call it e but event seems safer considering some browsers provide their own event object to those callbacks.
[09:45:02] <tiblock> Hi. I asked #css but no answer, maybe you can help me. It's an CSS question. I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/jt9w49b1/ and in chrome both elements are spining but in firefox 32.0.3 only image is spinning and span doesn't. Why is that? Where is my error?
[09:45:16] <BillCriswell> boombadaroomba: Event delegation would be good to look up.
[09:45:28] <boombadaroomba> Thank you BillCriswell
[09:45:44] <decx> tiblock span is inline and ignores animations, set to inline-block
[09:45:45] <BillCriswell> boombadaroomba: Basically, wait for events on a static container and check which child element triggered the event and act accordingly.
[09:45:48] <selectbox> i am now using "element" instead of "this", should be fine right?
[09:45:59] <BillCriswell> boombadaroomba: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:46:09] <tiblock> decx, ah, thank you so much
[09:52:21] <robertmaxrees> selectbox call it 'event'
[09:52:23] <robertmaxrees> or 'e'
[09:52:28] <robertmaxrees> since that argument is the event object.
[09:52:30] <robertmaxrees> not the element itself.
[09:53:36] <selectbox> ok, thank you, i guesse i have a lot of reading to do about jquery. up until now i am having a blast
[09:53:51] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ is good times :)
[09:54:01] <robertmaxrees> also http://api.jquery.com/ is fantastic, too.
[09:54:14] <BloodyScythe> the learn site could be better, though
[09:54:23] <robertmaxrees> sure, but i's a good place to start.
[09:54:34] <arthurvr> personally i prefer reading the learn site in the github repo, it's cleaner ;-)
[09:54:56] <robertmaxrees> just givin' the dude a place to start, y'all.
[09:54:59] <BloodyScythe> I've ran into code where below it says "but it's outdated, so don't use it" way too often while reading it
[09:55:07] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[09:55:12] <arthurvr> BloodyScythe, examle?
[09:55:29] <arthurvr> * example ;-)
[09:57:24] <BloodyScythe> maybe later if I can fight my headache
[09:58:29] <robertmaxrees> there is some outdated info on there, i'll agree.
[09:59:35] <egp> if you have an attribute like data-blah=“[“var1”, “var2”]” what’s proper way to escape it so when you read the string attribute you can do a $.parseJSON?  I tried doing html escaping: data-blah=“[&quot;var1&quot;, &quot;var2&quot;]” but $.parseJSON($(elem).data(‘blah”)) then complains about seeing & characters :)
[10:00:05] <decx> if it's escaped you can access it directly
[10:00:18] <decx> .data('blah')[1]
[10:00:30] <robertmaxrees> since it's already an object.
[10:01:25] <openyk> last chance till I give up and move on, 15 hours and a stack overflow question yields no results
[10:02:28] <robertmaxrees> egp http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lxey1tao/
[10:02:41] <openyk> http://jsfiddle.net/okodaqyh/
[10:02:41] <egp> robertmaxrees: well that’s sorta cheating :)
[10:03:02] <openyk> can someone help me with a seemingly basic jstree implementation
[10:03:24] <robertmaxrees> openyk what's your question?
[10:03:44] <openyk> http://jsfiddle.net/okodaqyh/ I need to get jstree with ajax working for a file manager
[10:04:03] <robertmaxrees> openyk okay - are you getting any console errors or anything?
[10:04:09] <egp> decx: interesting .data('blah')[1] actually just returns me the first character in the .data(‘blah’)
[10:04:26] <openyk> yeah, TypeError: e is undefined
[10:04:38] <robertmaxrees> egp you need to use '["var1", "var2"]', not the quotes the other way around.
[10:04:42] <openyk> I finally got the code to a point that it makes the POST call then shoots that error
[10:05:13] <robertmaxrees> openyk so the first thing I'm noticing is if (typeof data != "undefined") { <- data isn't what you thing it is afaik
[10:05:49] <egp> robertmaxrees: yeah I get hte gist, I just hate looking at attributes that use ‘ as the outer :) or controlling my own escaping incase I ever print a string with a ‘ or another “ in it/etc
[10:06:14] <egp> robertmaxrees: want to make sure I don’t shoot myself in the foot later
[10:06:16] <robertmaxrees> egp then you'll need to do soem .replace()ing on those strings.
[10:06:26] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you don't have JSON to parse ;)
[10:06:36] <robertmaxrees> openyk do your ajax call outside of the jstree call btw.
[10:06:57] <egp> robertmaxrees: kinda a funky hack: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10715801/javascript-decoding-html-entities
[10:07:04] <robertmaxrees> unless it natively supports doing ajax.  which it might.
[10:07:32] <openyk> data doesn't need to be set the first time it runs to get the root folder so it's ok. the critical steps are 1. take the received data from the server and make a jstree with it without error and 2. have the jstree repeat the process when a node is selected (which it does automatically I think)
[10:07:54] <openyk> I can't do the ajax call outside the jstree because jstree won't do its magic with the server data then
[10:07:56] <robertmaxrees> openyk yeah, so start with fixing if (typeof data != "undefined") {
[10:08:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'm looking at the docs now, openyk
[10:08:12] <openyk> k ty
[10:08:22] <openyk> Ill paste a jsfiddle with the external ajax path
[10:08:30] <openyk> I tried it but got stuck along the way that way
[10:08:40] <robertmaxrees> you do see that the line i've called out a few times will never work, right?
[10:08:45] <robertmaxrees> because data isn't a variable at that point.
[10:10:05] <egp> $.parseJSON($('<div/>').html($selected.data("images360-json-array")).text()) actually seems to work pretty well
[10:10:14] <openyk> k here's the external ajax with jstree http://jsfiddle.net/seyufe3j/
[10:10:55] <openyk> jstree makes data a variable in its magicks doesnt it?
[10:11:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:11:19] <robertmaxrees> not that i'm seeing...
[10:11:35] <robertmaxrees> also you've got a bad config in that latest example.
[10:11:47] <robertmaxrees> hit the "jshint" button up top.
[10:13:25] <openyk> few extra commas and semicolons, no big deal but I edited it up
[10:13:33] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[10:13:44] <robertmaxrees> bad matching closing curlies and parens, too.
[10:14:17] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: "the computer knows what I mean!"
[10:14:24] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[10:14:55] <openyk> xD i blame hasty copy paste and delete
[10:15:13] * Robdgreat moves to have openyk's coding license suspended
[10:15:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/seyufe3j/7/ with syntax fixes.
[10:15:42] <openyk> http://jsfiddle.net/seyufe3j/8/ with fixes
[10:16:14] <robertmaxrees> wait i thought jstree does its own ajax?  i'm confused now.
[10:16:17] <openyk> @ Robdgreat at least I make good comments?
[10:16:45] <openyk> robert that's exactly it, jstree does its own ajax and magicks so no need to do the external
[10:16:54] <openyk> but either way Im terribly stuck
[10:17:10] <robertmaxrees> then go back to your previous code and fix it...
[10:17:31] <openyk> http://jsfiddle.net/okodaqyh/1/ with ajax internal jstree
[10:17:53] <robertmaxrees> okay, now do the jshint against that.
[10:18:01] <robertmaxrees> the data variable can't magically exist inside that function.
[10:18:01] <openyk> you must un derstand I've been trying to "fix" it for quite a time now. over 10 hours
[10:18:45] <robertmaxrees> i read that earlier, but you didn't listen to what i said earlier ;)
[10:18:56] <robertmaxrees> the data variable doesn't exist.  that's where you're starting to have problems i'll bet.
[10:19:51] <shoky> don't use "data"  just use "node"
[10:19:56] <robertmaxrees> ^ try that.
[10:20:34] <openyk> http://jsfiddle.net/okodaqyh/4/ kk updated
[10:21:07] <robertmaxrees> does it work?
[10:21:17] <shoky> node != "undefined"   ?
[10:21:26] <robertmaxrees> think they mean typeof
[10:21:46] <shoky> and they still use "data"
[10:21:47] <shoky> ;p
[10:21:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:21:50] <openyk> i mean... http://jsfiddle.net/okodaqyh/6/
[10:21:52] <openyk> xD
[10:22:19] <robertmaxrees> there's no second arg to that function.
[10:22:26] <robertmaxrees> so take the data arg out.
[10:22:37] <shoky> uhm also what's this for  string.substring(0, string.length);
[10:22:59] <openyk> ... http://jsfiddle.net/okodaqyh/8/
[10:23:12] <robertmaxrees> openyk are you actually trying these?  we're flying blind here.
[10:23:13] <shoky> you still have    if (node != "undefined")
[10:23:40] <robertmaxrees> openyk http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/okodaqyh/9/ try this version on your server.
[10:23:42] <openyk> yes I am, the thing is that block doesnt matter as much to the key error
[10:24:00] <robertmaxrees> open up the console - are you getting errors?  what's happening?
[10:25:04] <openyk> got an error, fixed it, updated and got key error: http://jsfiddle.net/okodaqyh/10/
[10:25:12] <hwamokp66> the  "see full day schedule" links should open up fancybox iframe but it's just going to the html doc directly. Not sure why it's not working, it was earlier today. http://lansing.hpcreatives.net/#schedule
[10:25:27] <openyk> TypeError: e is undefined
[10:26:03] <openyk> @shoky that's to remove the square brackets
[10:26:39] <shoky> that just copies the string, openyk
[10:26:40] <robertmaxrees> openyk there's no use of the `e` object in there.  is there something else in your code using that?
[10:28:22] <openyk> xD shoky I tried without it didn't work so it was weird xD
[10:29:03] <openyk> robert I do have functions using e, they've not give me problems before but I'll try running without em
[10:30:29] <hwamokp66> the  "see full day schedule" links should open up fancybox iframe but it's just going to the html doc directly. Not sure why it's not working, it was earlier today. http://lansing.hpcreatives.net/#schedule
[10:30:33] <robertmaxrees> openyk is your debugger reporting that error in the jstree stuff, ooor...
[10:30:59] <openyk> initial deletions still putting that e error
[10:31:10] <openyk> it's originating from jquery-2.0.3.min.js
[10:31:12] <robertmaxrees> hwamokp66 jquery isn't defined.
[10:31:30] <robertmaxrees> openyk check out fixingthesejquery.com at this point.
[10:32:32] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: ?
[10:32:46] <robertmaxrees> hwamokp66 open your console - i'm seeing an error about $ not being defined.
[10:33:35] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: i have the $(".various").fancybox({ and the class i called on the link is "various"
[10:33:46] <robertmaxrees> that...
[10:34:01] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change anything.  you're not loading jquery before you try to run that code.
[10:34:39] <robertmaxrees> that entire block needs to be after the jquery and fancybox script includes.
[10:34:56] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: ohhhh.. hahaha gotcha, so if i just <!-- Add jQuery library --> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
[10:35:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:35:15] <robertmaxrees> you already have jquery included on the page.
[10:35:18] <robertmaxrees> just after you try to run that code.
[10:35:41] <openyk> romertmaxrees I confirmed with the debugger that the problem lies in the jstree block
[10:35:41] <robertmaxrees> look at your page source - you have a bunch of JS already at the bottom of the page.  stick it after the fancybox script includes.
[10:36:35] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: ahh gotcha, i put it at the bottom and its working. I wonder why it worked before thougha nd now it isnt?
[10:36:45] <robertmaxrees> hwamokp66 caching maybe
[10:36:57] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: you are probably right haha. thanks for correcting my noobie mistake. I appreciate it!
[10:37:02] <robertmaxrees> no big deal.
[10:37:15] <robertmaxrees> openyk i don't know what to tell you at this point. that code block doesn't refer any object named `e`. without seeing the whole thing functioning in context, it's hard to know where to point you next.
[10:37:29] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: btw, do i need to learn javascript to learn jquery or should i just do some tutorials on jquery?
[10:37:36] <robertmaxrees> both
[10:37:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest learning javascript basics first.
[10:37:53] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: but should i do JS first? oh kk gotcha
[10:37:59] <openyk> I will delve deeper and return with some "data"
[10:38:07] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: do you think thats more useful than me learning php this winter?
[10:38:15] <robertmaxrees> openyk go through fixingthesejquery.com and see if that doesn't help.
[10:38:25] <robertmaxrees> hwamokp66 depends on your goals as a developer.
[10:38:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd learn client-side and servers-die
[10:38:34] <openyk> yeah, I'm on it. thanks for the link
[10:38:36] <robertmaxrees> *server-side
[10:39:00] <decx> servers die though
[10:39:03] <decx> it's sad
[10:39:10] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[10:39:12] <robertmaxrees> *server-side
[10:39:15] <decx> offline first :(
[10:39:20] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: I'm mostly just working with templates to create quick websites. Only times I mess around with php is when I'm editing wp temps or messing with the mailing script
[10:39:50] <robertmaxrees> learn both sides of the equation.
[10:39:55] <robertmaxrees> that should be your eventual goal.
[10:40:01] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: but it seems liek theres some good money in the wp field so I'm not sure which to do first. i know i use jquery a lot more in my html/css temps
[10:40:16] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: hahah true that haha thats the end goal but just trying to decide which to learn this winter
[10:40:23] <robertmaxrees> I'd do JS.
[10:40:24] <robertmaxrees> and jquery.
[10:40:42] <robertmaxrees> to get a language and library under your belt.
[10:40:58] <robertmaxrees> that'll get you started.  then start learning server-side.  that'll teach you a bunch.
[10:41:30] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: gotcha, thanks for the tips
[10:42:49] <robertmaxrees> the eventual goal is to know which tool is right for which job and use it - should x thing be done server-side or client side?  when do i use CSS vs JS?  stuff like that.
[10:43:34] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: hmm i see isee
[10:44:16] <hwamokp66> http://www.lansing.hpcreatives.net/schedule_monday.html why are there weird characters in the name
[10:44:43] <robertmaxrees> bad encoding
[10:46:14] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: is there somethign i can do to fix that?
[10:46:36] <P0rk> does .wrap work on jquery objects that aren't attached to the dom yet?
[10:46:45] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/f324ktmz/2/
[10:47:16] <shoky> openyk here's a working example (using jsfiddle's json echo service to simulate server response)  http://jsfiddle.net/0qxrw2sy/1/
[10:47:38] <robertmaxrees> hwamokp66 meta tags, check to make sure your server config is right, etc.
[10:48:01] <robertmaxrees> P0rk should work on fragments just fine.
[10:48:23] <P0rk> do I wrap with html or another jquery object?
[10:49:15] <robertmaxrees> the docs tell you.
[10:49:26] <robertmaxrees> "The .wrap() function can take any string or object that could be passed to the $() factory function to specify a DOM structure."
[10:49:47] <kinesis> Can anyone tell me if my syntax at line #25 is the correct use of $.post() ? http://jsfiddle.net/3kgtqv45/1/
[10:50:12] <P0rk> Sorry, I thought that's why we had IRC channel, so that we could get a discussion about it rather than just a technical reference. My bad. Thanks for the advice.
[10:50:38] <robertmaxrees> P0rk huh?  just pointing you in to the docs :) they're pretty clear about it.
[10:51:03] <robertmaxrees> self-reliance and all that :D
[10:51:43] <P0rk> Not really getting the second version...But no worries, I'll figure it out. Thanks for your help
[10:52:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost about what the problem is, but okay.  you're welcome.
[10:52:32] <P0rk> Aha! Returns the original set of elements, not the wrapped elements. that's the issue
[10:52:45] <hwamokp66> robertmaxrees: did you mean  <meta charset="utf-8">
[10:53:01] <robertmaxrees> hwamokp66 and the encoding that's put out by the server :)
[10:53:14] <kinesis> My code used to work but Imade some changes now it doesn't. What is wrong with line #25 post at http://jsfiddle.net/3kgtqv45/1/ can anyone tell me if it is incorrect?
[10:54:42] <robertmaxrees> kinesis should be about right.  what's the problem you're running into?
[10:54:52] <kinesis> Internal Server Error 500
[10:55:22] <openyk> robertmaxrees I made some progress, with that slideshow and your example, I tried adding a children = true line in the php and I'm seeing directories
[10:55:27] <P0rk> So if I create a jquery object from html that has two elements in it and want to wrap both elements in a single element, I guess wrap won't work. It wraps the two elements seperately:http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/f324ktmz/3/
[10:55:35] <robertmaxrees> sounds like your server isn't handling the post data correctly, KindOne
[10:56:21] <robertmaxrees> err, kinesis
[10:57:01] <robertmaxrees> P0rk yeah, becuase you have a set of elements.
[10:57:20] <kinesis> here is the PHP code. I have been working on this problem forever, error_reporting is E_ALL in php.ini too.. http://pastie.org/private/wdmz4e5hpomhbnlo8tfda
[10:57:22] <robertmaxrees> you probably want wrapAll() instead.
[10:57:33] <robertmaxrees> kinesis you should probably ask in ##php instead.
[10:58:09] <robertmaxrees> i have a meeting.  enjoy folks.
[11:03:41] <boombadaroomba> This function only runs once. does anyone mind explaining why this doesnt apply to all? http://jsfiddle.net/55nqu/6/
[11:03:54] <boombadaroomba> it only applies to the top most tr
[11:04:47] <shoky> boombadaroomba: what do you mean.. what do you want it to do. add some html
[11:05:44] <shoky> your code hides the <tr> which is a parent of the clicked #remFav element, if it exists
[11:10:29] <boombadaroomba> shoky: yeah, but there are many of these but it only does the top most instance
[11:10:57] <shoky> boombadaroomba: many of what
[11:11:07] <shoky> your code only hides one element
[11:12:19] <boombadaroomba> i have a remove button id remFav. it is a td and is nested in a tr. THere are many of these. It only hides the top most. I want it to apply to all instances
[11:12:41] <shoky> id's must be unique. use a class instead
[11:13:12] <boombadaroomba> thank you so much shoky
[11:14:33] <shoky> and btw .parent will only find the tr if it is a direct parent of the clicked element
[11:14:43] <shoky> you probably want .closest('tr') instead
[11:20:22] <boombadaroomba> shoky: thanks, they both work. Is closest better or should i just leave the working code alone?
[11:21:53] <shoky> boombadaroomba: doesnt really matter, but closest will keep working even if you change your html and add more elements in the tr, that wrap the clicked element, so the tr isn't the direct parent anymore
[11:22:38] <boombadaroomba> shoky: what is best practice? it works within the full scope of the app
[11:23:08] <boombadaroomba> if im going to do something, i might as well learn to do it right at the start
[11:23:13] <shoky> .closest('tr') ;]
[11:23:26] <boombadaroomba> shoky: thank you. im just a grom
[11:23:30] <shoky> again, if you're sure that the <tr> will always stay the direct parent, it doesn't matter
[11:23:46] <shoky> but just using .closest will remove one thing to worry about ;p
[11:32:38] <maZtah> hi, how would i get this to work?   $("tr.year").not(':input').click(...)
[11:34:34] <openyk> yes it's working!  jstree with ajax getting folders. javascript and php: http://jsfiddle.net/okodaqyh/12/
[11:37:20] <robertmaxrees> openyk awesome.  well done :D
[11:38:14] <openyk> final step is to get the button functions working, will return with solution/questions if need be
[11:46:59] <blue_warlock> hi
[11:47:23] <blue_warlock> need to set timeout function but doesnot work properly
[11:51:48] <maZtah> is there a better way to write this? (coffeescript alert)
[11:51:59] <maZtah>   $('.toggle_all_comments').click ->
[11:51:59] <maZtah>     current_state = $(this).attr 'data-current-state'
[11:51:59] <maZtah>     if current_state == 'open'
[11:51:59] <maZtah>       $('.declaration_comments').hide()
[11:51:59] <maZtah>       $(this).attr 'data-current-state', 'closed'
[11:51:59] <maZtah>     else
[11:52:00] <maZtah>       $('.declaration_comments').show()
[11:52:00] <maZtah>       $(this).attr 'data-current-state', 'open'
[11:52:01] <maZtah>     false
[11:52:06] <Jattenalle> no.
[11:52:08] <maZtah> shit, sorry, wrong button!!! :-(
[11:52:12] <robertmaxrees> welp
[11:52:13] <maZtah> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/uALAmm72
[11:52:22] <Jattenalle> you are forgiven
[11:52:25] <maZtah> that's what i try to do...... sorry ;-(
[11:55:31] <kevireillly> blue_warlock: in what way does it not work properly?
[11:57:36] <blue_warlock> setInterval(function () { get_mylink("/administer/refresh.gtml", "#refresh") }, 5000);
[11:57:51] <blue_warlock> i must load that function every 20 minutes
[11:57:52] <lucenut> Hey guys, I have jQuery Validation Plugin 1.9.0 and regular form validation things like required work great.
[11:58:15] <blue_warlock> it just refresh sessions
[12:01:49] <adv_> i have var foo= 5, then i'm doing an ajax call to get a new value for foo (let's say 8), and i want to apply it to the original embedded <script> so that foo = 8 (for example). how can i do this?
[12:05:13] <lucenut> But I have a set of selectboxes that I want to validate at least one has a value chosen.
[12:06:19] <henn1nk> using jquery ui draggable/dropable..is there a way to drop a different html content than the dragged element?
[12:10:45] <lucenut> Can someone help me do this selectbox validation?
[12:12:23] <openyk> ok apparently I made a mistake, THIS is the working jstree ajax with PHP that works for infinite folder levels, previous one only did 2 levels. UPDATED: http://jsfiddle.net/okodaqyh/13/
[12:14:07] <bytemask> hey anyone here use tinypass and are having issues with their stuff hijacking calls to $
[12:20:47] <_Brandon_> hi, is there a form input widget that converts the value from bytes to mbytes so that the end user can input the size in mbytes while the real value is in bytes?
[12:22:16] <blue_warlock> why doesnt work this
[12:22:17] <blue_warlock> setInterval(function () { get_mylink("/administer/refresh.gtml", "#refresh") }, 5000);
[12:22:31] <robertmaxrees> blue_warlock any console errors or anything?
[12:22:37] <blue_warlock> nope
[12:22:57] <robertmaxrees> if you put a console.log() in that get_mylink function, does it print out?
[12:24:11] <logikos> hi, i have a couple drag and drop file boxes inside a form, on drop i'm doing $(this).data('files',e.originalEvent.dataTransfer.files) so that in the on submit event i can do var data  = new FormData(this); and $('.filedropzone').each(function(){}) and access $(this).data('files) ...
[12:24:24] <logikos> but how I place those files into data i'm not sure
[12:24:34] <blue_warlock> console.log ?
[12:24:45] <robertmaxrees> blue_warlock are you familiar with console.log()?
[12:24:47] <robertmaxrees> console.log('
[12:25:17] <robertmaxrees> * console.log('hello') will write "hello" to your js console.  you can use that as a quick test to see if the get_myLink function is even running.
[12:25:34] <logikos> my end goal is to submit the files with the form even though they are not really part of the form (not in a form element) .. if i could somehow bind the droped files with hidden <input type=file> tags that would be fine....
[12:25:54] <blue_warlock> nope
[12:26:03] <robertmaxrees> blue_warlock can you make a quick fiddle?
[12:26:22] <blue_warlock> its 2 pages script
[12:26:33] <robertmaxrees> just the relevant parts for the interval.
[12:26:48] <blue_warlock> i just need to reload the content of second page in a div with id=refresh
[12:27:18] <blue_warlock> what is console log
[12:27:30] <blue_warlock> if i put that function in there must be printed?
[12:27:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/etd7Lstn/
[12:27:48] <robertmaxrees> open up the console in your dev tools.
[12:28:02] <robertmaxrees> you'll see the text get printed every 5 seconds.
[12:29:58] <Robdgreat> is datatables on topic in here?
[12:30:03] <Robdgreat> I"m losing my mind.
[12:30:20] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat sort of?  not many of us have used it.  we get people asking questions all the time to varying degrees of success.
[12:30:45] <robertmaxrees> i usually point them to the forums.  should probably reach out to the developers and tell 'em to make an irc channel to point people to.
[12:31:06] <blue_warlock> i have opened console but i dont see the text you say
[12:31:20] <robertmaxrees> screenshot?
[12:31:34] <blue_warlock> im using FireFox
[12:31:38] <Robdgreat> ah, all of a sudden when I add a row to a table that was previously working fine I get an alert about requested unknown parameter '[object Object] for row 2, instructing me to refer to datatables.net/tn/4, which isn't very helpful
[12:31:52] * Robdgreat just throwing this out there in case someone has encountered it
[12:32:03] <robertmaxrees> blue_warlock http://i.imgur.com/nZCmtTp.png should look something like this.
[12:32:16] <Robdgreat> not the instruction to check that page isn't very helpful, but the page itself isn't very helpful
[12:32:25] <blue_warlock> yes
[12:32:34] <robertmaxrees> blue_warlock http://i.imgur.com/ZbPZBpM.png make sure you have JS turned on, as well as "logging"
[12:32:38] <blue_warlock> but doesnt print the text every 5 seconds
[12:32:47] <robertmaxrees> blue_warlock does it print once?
[12:32:48] <blue_warlock> a wait
[12:32:51] <blue_warlock> wait
[12:32:56] <blue_warlock> yes
[12:33:01] <blue_warlock> i must open log
[12:33:12] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[12:34:04] <blue_warlock> but wait
[12:34:11] <blue_warlock> this is refreshing all the page
[12:34:31] <robertmaxrees> can you show the code for the function you're trying to run?
[12:34:38] <blue_warlock> kk
[12:35:24] <blue_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/etd7Lstn/1/
[12:36:10] <robertmaxrees> blue_warlock first of all, don't do that.
[12:36:35] <blue_warlock> :O
[12:36:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/etd7Lstn/3/ this is closer to what you'd want.
[12:37:57] <robertmaxrees> instead of using setInterval though, you want to manually set timeouts.
[12:38:03] <robertmaxrees> otherwise the request might not complete in time.
[12:40:56] <robertmaxrees> blue_warlock you want something more akin to http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/etd7Lstn/4/
[12:41:03] <robertmaxrees> though there are much cleaner ways to do that, you get the idea.
[12:41:30] <blue_warlock> it works robertmaxrees
[12:41:55] <blue_warlock> now works properly and session get refreshed of other 20mins when im logged in
[12:42:02] <robertmaxrees> cool
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> see the distinction?
[12:42:08] <blue_warlock> ty man really
[12:42:13] <blue_warlock> yes
[12:42:20] <blue_warlock> i dunno why i sent function outside
[12:42:28] <blue_warlock> of main function
[12:43:02] <blue_warlock> thanks mam =)
[12:43:26] <nrl> if I fire off a function just by using functionName();, how can I make sure it only runs once? In this case, the functions starts a sound file using howler, but the sound just keeps starting and I'm left with tons of instances (channels?) playing the sound.
[12:43:45] <robertmaxrees> nrl depends.  can you share your code?
[12:43:58] <louism2wash> hey guys, I'm trying to get a swiping effect to work using a loop that decrements a jquery object's css position property but no animation occurs until after the loop has executed and the image is just moved once rather than slowly swiped across the screen.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.   http://jsfiddle.net/ch3ts3xu/
[12:44:38] <nrl> alright, hang on
[12:45:42] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash use http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[12:46:39] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: I know about animate but I am trying to understand why this doesn't work.  Any idea why this in particular doesn't work?
[12:46:51] <nrl> basically just looks like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jfsf8n9z/
[12:47:10] <robertmaxrees> the browser doesn;t understand what you want, so it skips to the last step because nothing it telling it to step between each step basically.
[12:47:15] <nrl> the color variable is a bunch of numbers generated by the gyroscopic function in a smartphone.
[12:48:08] <robertmaxrees> nrl nothing in here says that it should run more than once.  is this bound to an event listener or something?
[12:48:55] <nrl> might be actually. I think gyro.js uses that to determine angles and position
[12:49:10] <robertmaxrees> sounds like the event listener might be incorrect then.
[12:49:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd check that.
[12:49:13] <nrl> are there workarounds?
[12:49:29] <robertmaxrees> you could set a status bit in the parent scope for when the sound is playing.
[12:49:42] <nrl> alright, what exactly would I be looking for? kind of new to js overall
[12:50:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jfsf8n9z/1/ would be the status bit
[12:51:03] <robertmaxrees> i don't know anything about that library, so i have no idea.
[12:51:12] <robertmaxrees> try the status bit idea.
[12:51:29] <robertmaxrees> the .onStop() probably isn't the right method name, but it should get the idea accross.
[12:51:35] <mrbubbles> Hi guys, this is kind of a highcharts related question but I'm someone will know the answer. If I call: $('#kWh-latest').highcharts(this.chartOptions); var chart = $('#kWh-latest').highcharts(); I can then call chart.addSeries(series, true); to add a series. But if I call var chart = $('#kWh-latest').highcharts(this.chartOptions);, the chart doesn't render. How come I can't do it in a single statement?
[12:52:21] <robertmaxrees> mrbubbles probably because of the way the return values get sent around.
[12:52:25] <robertmaxrees> initialization and whatnot.
[12:52:28] <mrbubbles> aaah
[12:54:52] <nrl> would something like this work? http://jsfiddle.net/jfsf8n9z/3/
[12:55:45] <robertmaxrees> nope, because those if statements don't continually run.
[12:55:52] <robertmaxrees> they're running once on pageload and that's it.
[12:56:22] <nrl> oh alright. thanks
[12:58:31] <Paradisee> is there a simple way to get the relative position of an element inside a <div> ?
[12:58:48] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/position/
[12:58:51] <robertmaxrees> "
[12:59:06] <robertmaxrees> "Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent."
[12:59:10] <robertmaxrees> read the note on that page though.
[12:59:25] <Paradisee> i gives the position absolute of the element inside the page
[12:59:52] <robertmaxrees> relative to the offset parent.
[13:00:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you need to manually calculate it yourself.
[13:00:11] <Paradisee> i'm not able to do it
[13:00:35] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.  use .offset().top and .offset().left on the element in question and the parent.
[13:01:28] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: is there any reason why you wouldn't be able to use offset() in a for loop to change the position of an element on a page in a swipe effect?
[13:01:38] <Paradisee> Object {top: 224, left: 947.265625}
[13:01:42] <Paradisee> this is absolute
[13:03:45] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you'll need to compare that against the parent element's offset values.
[13:03:48] <robertmaxrees> dunno what else to tell you.
[13:04:07] <kevin> any difference between $(selector,context) and $(context).find(selector) ?
[13:04:07] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash because the for loop runs too fast basically.  use .animate() for these kinds of things.
[13:04:16] <Paradisee>                 var pos = clone.offset();
[13:04:16] <Paradisee>                 var parent = clone.parent().offset();
[13:04:29] <Paradisee> Object {top: 109, left: 470.5} Object {top: 224, left: 947.265625}
[13:04:37] <robertmaxrees> kevin the first maps to the second under the hood.
[13:04:42] <kevin> k
[13:04:49] <Paradisee> they should have the same values, but they havent's
[13:04:51] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee so do whatever calculations you need with that data.
[13:04:52] <Paradisee> haven't
[13:05:01] <robertmaxrees> then share your code?
[13:05:21] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/38Q2MKJ
[13:05:27] <Paradisee> line 50
[13:06:15] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: I created a sleep function that pauses the loop for 100 milliseconds and it still doesn't work not trying to play devils advocate, just trying to understand what I am missing.
[13:10:20] <kevin> i love when i just think 'hmm this should be a function, i wonder if it is" and behold it is
[13:10:33] <kevin> just discovered $.makeArray
[13:11:30] <BillCriswell> kevin: Haven't needed that one yet.
[13:12:10] <Hackwar1> hi folks, I'm using the Superfish Menu Plugin and it attaches display:block to a bunch of my elements. That is extremely annoying and prevents me from doing what I want. Now I tried to remove that behavior, but for fucks sake, I can't find where it does that shit. Is there a way to find out which code snippet does this?
[13:12:35] <kevin> doing a "call function X for each element in array" but the array might not actually be an array (xml to json conversion) so had to ensure it was by using $.makeArray
[13:13:24] <nrl> could anyone take a quick look at this little snippet. why doesn't it work? http://jsfiddle.net/01d51h4q/
[13:13:41] <BillCriswell> kevin: Sounds like it fits the needs.
[13:13:57] <BillCriswell> nrl: indexOf is 0 based.
[13:14:13] <BillCriswell> The indexOf '0' is actually 0
[13:15:09] <nrl> so the variable can't just be a 0?
[13:15:34] <Robdgreat> nrl: you're checking that it's 1. it's not 1. it's 0
[13:15:48] <Robdgreat> 0 is the first index of a string
[13:16:14] <nrl> oh, yeah. solved it, thanks!
[13:16:39] <Robdgreat> when checking against a value and it's not what you expect, you should output the actual value rather than just some string like nah :)
[13:17:32] <nrl> how would I do that?
[13:21:10] <Robdgreat> console.log(whatever.indexOf('0'))
[13:30:50] <Absolute0> How can I delect a non match in a select tag?
[13:30:50] <sha1sum> If I have multiple elements with overflow: scroll, is it possible to set the focus on one of the containers so that when the mouse wheel is used it will scroll that one?
[13:31:00] <sha1sum> Particularly because in Foundation's Off Canvas when I show the off canvas and use the scroll wheel over it it is scrolling the page behind it... I have to click somewhere in the container for the off canvas to scroll it.
[13:33:46] <robertmaxrees> Absolute0 huh?
[13:34:06] <robertmaxrees> it's not in the collection, soooo..
[13:34:28] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: Yeah I'd give that question another shot.
[13:34:40] <Absolute0> robertmaxrees: for <select> the user can enter keystrocks to select matching <options>, how can I detect a non-match?
[13:34:49] <Absolute0> keystrokes
[13:35:12] <Absolute0> Is there a decent select picker that is fast?
[13:35:23] <robertmaxrees> uh, not for what you're looking for?
[13:35:25] <Absolute0> I was using bootstrap-select but after you get a few options it's very slow
[13:36:30] <Absolute0> <select><option value="foo">Foo</option></select> <-- typing 'foo' will trigger the first option, how can I detect non-matches?
[13:36:54] <Omar-> Absolute0 you mean filter? show/hide options based on characters entered?
[13:37:16] <Absolute0> no I want to trigger a popup
[13:38:43] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to determine that manually.
[13:38:57] <Absolute0> http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[13:39:26] <robertmaxrees> unless the select's value is set to that highlighted option
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> oh, if you're using that, just do $('.active-result').not('.active');
[13:45:32] <Respek> robertmaxrees: thanks for the great advice yesterday! did a transparent overlay to get around it!
[13:45:49] <sha1sum> Is there a way to lock scrolling "behind" an absolutely-positioned container with overflow:scroll? Want to lock the body from scrolling if a particular container is shown
[13:46:21] <robertmaxrees> sha1sum you have to do overflow: hidden; on window or body (i can't remember which)
[13:54:34] <BillCriswell> My brain hurts.
[14:05:27] <kevin> better to use elem.hasClass("x") or elem.is(".x") ?
[14:06:02] <robertmaxrees> depends on the case.
[14:06:13] <robertmaxrees> hasClass() is a little more explicit.
[14:08:08] <alexclark> hi all, i am trying to create a table with a fixed header which ive done and works perfectly
[14:08:59] <alexclark> but now im trying to add a resize event to make sure it still works when the browser is resized and now when the browser is resized the fixed header doesnt show
[14:09:02] <alexclark> heres my code
[14:09:03] <alexclark> https://gist.github.com/alexclarkofficial/f29b367cbde4cfe81a5d
[14:09:06] <alexclark> any ideas?
[14:10:09] <robertmaxrees> do you want position() or offset()?
[14:11:16] <alexclark> what is the difference?
[14:11:59] <robertmaxrees> position() is relative to the offset parent, offset() is relative to the document
[14:13:33] <alexclark> well position is working without the resize
[14:16:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:16:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd try it with offset() just in case, but okay.
[14:20:16] <openyk> I'm back with more jstree woes
[14:21:03] <openyk> I don't understand the jstree docs much at all. even a simple refresh function
[14:21:21] <robertmaxrees> link to the page and we can step through it together :D
[14:21:56] <openyk> http://jsfiddle.net/59wcon2L/
[14:22:39] <openyk> the api docs just says refresh();
[14:22:50] <robertmaxrees> jQuery.jstree
[14:22:52] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't make any sense.
[14:23:29] <openyk> ill update it with the legacy way
[14:23:36] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:23:39] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[14:23:44] <robertmaxrees> what's the selector for the tree as-is?
[14:23:52] <openyk> http://jsfiddle.net/59wcon2L/1/
[14:24:05] <openyk> im not sure what u mean by selector
[14:24:27] <robertmaxrees> what element are you running jstree against when you initialize it?
[14:24:33] <openyk> $('.column-left')
[14:24:44] <robertmaxrees> try $('.column-left').refresh()
[14:24:52] <Omar-> robertmaxrees
[14:25:03] <robertmaxrees> rather. try $('.column-left').jstree('refresh')
[14:25:27] <openyk> k the first one was TypeError: $(...).refresh is not a function
[14:25:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah, second one should work.
[14:26:11] <openyk> second one works https://imgur.com/vRk8x8W
[14:26:23] <robertmaxrees> cool
[14:26:38] <openyk> sweet ty. now I can apply the same syntax over all the remaining functions
[14:26:48] <robertmaxrees> for the most part probably.
[14:26:55] <Omar-> http://www.jstree.com/api/#/?f=refresh()
[14:26:56] <robertmaxrees> i also searched google and got an SO answer that showed how.
[14:27:30] <Omar-> robertmaxrees are you a SO user?
[14:27:38] <robertmaxrees> Omar- yes, on occasion.
[14:27:39] <openyk> I searched hard and was testing jstree.refresh.jswork refresh(jstree.refresh.jquery) .javascript.jquery.js.tree.re.fresh
[14:27:39] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:27:58] <robertmaxrees> openyk i got this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3682045/how-can-i-refresh-the-contents-of-a-jstree
[14:28:38] <openyk> you deciphered that page better than I did xD
[14:28:43] <Omar-> robertmaxrees just out of curiosity. I'm a SO user too.
[14:28:59] <robertmaxrees> openyk i looked for the one with the green checkmark.
[14:29:14] <robertmaxrees> Omar- SO is fine for small stuff, but too many people use it for copy/paste solutions imo.
[14:29:28] <robertmaxrees> it's become a "do my job for me" site, instead of a "can somebody help me understand" site.
[14:30:04] <openyk> I guess to be clear I had hard time understanding what the tree. was referring to
[14:30:17] <openyk> looking at legacy code fills you with all sorts of confusions
[14:30:19] <robertmaxrees> that's the selector for the element.
[14:30:21] <Omar-> robertmaxrees true, and full reputation wh*res
[14:30:32] <robertmaxrees> "legacy code", openyk?
[14:30:36] <robertmaxrees> you mean the source code?
[14:30:48] <openyk> i mean the old jstree version code
[14:30:51] <Omar-> full of*
[14:30:51] <JovanJ> Did anyone  used blueimp plugin recently?
[14:31:12] <Omar-> JovanJ not me
[14:31:41] <robertmaxrees> openyk i'd check out learn.jquery.com btw - selectors are a pretty simple, but very important, concept to understand.
[14:31:50] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ JovanJ
[14:31:50] <b-ot> JovanJ: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:32:36] <Paradisee> why when i $(this).append(clone); the image will append it not where i dropped it?
[14:32:56] <JovanJ> I am stuck with adding images to database, I looked over docs but I am still stuck. Did anyone had some experience with adding images to database with blueimp?
[14:33:12] <robertmaxrees> because you're just appending an element, probably with no information about where to position it, Paradisee
[14:33:18] <robertmaxrees> JovanJ that's a backend question.
[14:33:28] <openyk> looks cool I'll stream thru it
[14:33:37] <Paradisee> how can i position it then
[14:33:58] <robertmaxrees> you use the fileuploader to send it to your server, then your server handles the saving part.
[14:34:08] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee by setting clone.css();
[14:34:09] <Omar-> Paradisee by reposition it where you've left it
[14:34:20] <JovanJ> where I am supposed to ask that question? in #php channel
[14:34:31] <robertmaxrees> JovanJ what backend are you using?
[14:34:34] <Omar-> .css({top: value, left: value})
[14:34:47] <JovanJ> PHP
[14:35:01] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, ask in ##php how you save a user-uploaded file to a database.
[14:35:46] <Paradisee> but im dropping it how can i know its value position
[14:35:50] <Paradisee> if im*
[14:36:01] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee what plugin are you using for the droppable stuff?
[14:36:03] <robertmaxrees> didn'
[14:36:09] <robertmaxrees> *didn't decx provide this example the other day?
[14:36:22] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: it's complicated to explain
[14:36:56] <Paradisee> what do you mean which plugin am i using
[14:37:09] <robertmaxrees> for the droppable part.
[14:37:13] <Omar-> Paradisee maybe by listening to "mouseup" event
[14:37:16] <Paradisee>     $('#container_map').droppable({
[14:37:16] <Paradisee>         drop: function(event, ui) {
[14:37:25] <robertmaxrees> so you're using jquery ui for it.
[14:37:29] <Paradisee> ofc
[14:37:37] <Omar-> nighty everyone
[14:38:59] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee yeah i remember decx showed somebody how to do this.  was it you?
[14:39:18] <Paradisee> yes robertmaxrees, but now got others problems with it
[14:39:59] <robertmaxrees> did you just throw his entire solution out then?
[14:40:04] <Paradisee> simply, when i drop an element it will appear in another position
[14:40:13] <Paradisee> nope robertmaxrees, this is another thing
[14:40:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.
[15:02:11] <openyk> this syntax is a big hassle. $('.column-left').jstree('refresh'); works but needing to pass arguments into the jstree function is a mystery. the fact that I don't know how to access the jstree data object is the pain point
[15:03:16] <openyk> $('.column-left').jstree('function', 'arg1, 'arg2') doesn't work, neither does ..jstree.function(arg1, arg2);
[15:03:54] <robertmaxrees> wonder if it's something like $('.column-left').jstree().refresh()
[15:04:32] <openyk> do I really need to rely on my imagination and play guess the syntax or is there a fundamental building block someone needs to tell me
[15:08:09] <openyk> robertmaxrees $('.column-left').jstree().refresh(); does seem to work, I'll try getting the data object with similar syntax
[15:16:04] <robertmaxrees> you could just do var $myTree = $('.column-left').jstree(); then do everything against $myTree.
[15:16:08] <robertmaxrees> like $myTree.refresh(), etc.
[15:18:07] <LilPaulG> Hi guys, I need help, how can I zoom out my picture while I scrolling down? this is my site http://www.garcestechnology.com/etech360/spotify-wide-pockets/wide-pockets-v1/demo/ , I want like this https://www.circle.com/en
[15:18:16] <LilPaulG> thanks in advance, Im using Jquery
[15:22:38] <thinkxl> LilPaulG: why don't you look into its source code?
[15:25:00] <shoky> openyk the main jstree.com page shows you 3 different ways to call jstree methods at the bottom
[15:25:41] <thinkxl> LilPaulG: https://www.circle.com/marketing/javascripts/main.js
[15:26:05] <thinkxl> here is where the code is, just use a web services like http://jsbeautifier.org/
[15:26:09] <LilPaulG> thinkxl: okay ill check out
[15:26:22] <thinkxl> and implement on yours
[15:26:48] <thinkxl> it is actually jQuery
[15:27:06] <LilPaulG> thinkxl: okay, will do, thanks!
[15:29:00] <openyk> shoky https://imgur.com/vRk8x8W I looked at that page before but it didn't pop out to me. I was deep in old code confusion. it's starting to make sense now
[15:29:26] <shoky> thanksies
[15:29:44] <frank_o> Hi! Trying to use the NProgress loader with jQuery Mobile -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/S3JhM/5/ -- but it stops working once the user changes page, so how do I configure it for a selector within the current jQuery Mobile page?
[15:29:48] <frank_o> I tried changing `NProgress.configure({ parent: '.here' });` to `NProgress.configure({ parent: activePage.find('.here') });` but all I get is: Uncaught SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'querySelector' on 'Document': '[object Object]' is not a valid selector.
[15:30:17] <frank_o> Also tried playing around with `[0]` to no avail.
[15:34:03] <openyk> lol for some reason javascript keeps making my post data pair an array and my server keeps giving me that gif me string not array error
[15:34:40] <openyk> var postData = {  'path' = node }; obviously must be correct no?
[15:35:41] <openyk> console saying its path[] -_-
[15:35:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:35:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[15:35:57] <openyk> no way
[15:36:04] <robertmaxrees> postData = { 'path'
[15:36:07] <robertmaxrees> woops one sec.
[15:36:37] <shoky> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/S3JhM/7/
[15:36:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qsbp5Lv6/
[15:36:43] <robertmaxrees> openyk
[15:37:03] <robertmaxrees> you need a colon for setting property names, not =
[15:38:25] <tinkiete> hello to all
[15:38:31] <openyk> so postData : { ...?
[15:38:38] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:38:46] <robertmaxrees> postdata = { 'prop': value }
[15:38:49] <robertmaxrees> like my example.
[15:38:56] <openyk> var postData = { 			'directory' : directory 		};
[15:39:02] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[15:39:08] <robertmaxrees> did you not look at the example i gave you?
[15:39:15] <openyk> yeah I looked its what i used
[15:39:42] <openyk> I wouldn't be that outrageous ;)
[15:40:04] <openyk> but was confused whether u meant the example was wrong or not since it was same as my posted
[15:40:13] <frank_o> shoky: damn, how'd you come up with that?
[15:40:15] <frank_o> thanks a lot
[15:40:31] <robertmaxrees> openyk it wasn't the same as what you posted.  that was the entire point.
[15:40:33] <shoky> frank_o: cause it needs a selector
[15:40:49] <shoky> e.g.  '#page1 .here'
[15:41:29] <frank_o> shoky: nice
[15:41:40] <frank_o> shoky: is there a way to make it work if the current page doesn't have an id though?
[15:42:21] <frank_o> no wait nevermind. pages require ids by default so.
[15:42:49] <tinkiete> im send data from php to jquery, the data is a json form [{content:'toto'}], in the ajax reponse , i using jsonParse to and $.each but i got this error SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 2 of the JSON dat this is my code http://pastebin.com/dWx3up0h
[15:43:00] <tinkiete> i dont get whats wrong
[15:43:45] <frank_o> shoky: actually no there are cases where pages dont have ids
[15:43:51] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete copy/paste the response from the server.
[15:43:53] <robertmaxrees> directly.
[15:44:33] <robertmaxrees> because something tells me you really need [{"content":"testing"}]
[15:45:09] <shoky> frank_o: if there's no way to make a selector that uniquely selects the element you want, then nope. at least from the little i saw of that nprogress code
[15:45:12] <openyk> robertmaxrees ahh I understand what u mean https://imgur.com/vRk8x8W gotta JSON_stringify the var node = .. , I assumed incorrectly that it was a string from the getgo
[15:45:33] <shoky> frank_o: it just calls document.querySelector(your_parent_selector_here)
[15:45:35] <tinkiete> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/amrGkd3p
[15:46:09] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete remove the square brackets from the front and back for starters.
[15:46:10] <frank_o> shoky: cool. im sure i can force ids on those id-less pages
[15:46:54] <JovanJ> Does anyone knows how I can pass javascript array to PHP? something with pst.]
[15:46:59] <JovanJ> post. etc
[15:47:03] <JovanJ> I am not sure what to do.
[15:47:18] <openyk> xD jovan buddy here ya go
[15:47:19] <robertmaxrees> JovanJ set the data in the post to the array?
[15:47:21] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean?
[15:47:35] <tinkiete> robertmaxrees: the server is passing the results like this
[15:47:53] <kevireilllly> JovanJ: you can use JSON
[15:47:53] <JovanJ> I've an javascript array, and I want to pass it to php. So i can get it with $_POST
[15:48:09] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete do you control the server?
[15:48:09] <openyk> http://jsfiddle.net/up8oyv6f/1/
[15:48:34] <tinkiete> yeah
[15:48:36] <openyk> jovan change the url in that script and set the data with javascript
[15:48:41] <robertmaxrees> JovanJ just post the data... $.post('url', ['some', 'data', 'here']);
[15:48:52] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete then fix it.  remove the first [ and the last ]
[15:50:23] <frank_o> shoky: would it be possible to make it work on classes?
[15:50:43] <kevireilllly> JovanJ: then PHP side it would be something like json_decode($_POST);
[15:50:54] <shoky> frank_o: anything that would let you have a selector uniquely selecting the element you want ;]
[15:52:28] <JovanJ> I am not really sure where I've to put that in jquery blueimp plugin, so I can access it later...
[15:52:28] <tinkiete> robertmaxrees: with json_encoder its gives the same answer
[15:52:47] <frank_o> shoky: dunno it says className is null: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/S3JhM/8/
[15:52:52] <tinkiete> but i have try the format in jsfiddle and i got no error i dont get why
[15:53:03] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete json is not javascript.
[15:53:14] <robertmaxrees> http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset
[15:55:17] <shoky> frank_o: 1. you forgot the dot before the class name  2. jquery-mobile adds many classes to the element so this isn't a good way
[15:55:57] <shoky> frank_o: use a different attribute like data-id  if you don't want to use id
[15:56:09] <shoky> i guess..
[15:56:21] <shoky> though that's what ids are for ;p
[15:58:45] <Ohga> hi, I'm trying to use Autocomplete from jq-ui to ignore a prefix when searching, and retaining it when updating. Would anyone like to assist me in figuring out how to do that?
[15:59:05] <tinkiete> robertmaxrees: so what should i do then? because js_encoder gives the response in that format
[16:00:06] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete dunno anything about php so no clue
[16:00:29] <tinkiete> lol, oki
[16:00:49] <openyk> tinkiete you wanna try json_encode / json_decode?
[16:01:28] <frank_o> shoky: good point, thanks!
[16:01:28] <tinkiete> im send data from php to jquery, the data is a json form [{content:'toto'}], in the ajax reponse , i using jsonParse to and $.each but i got this error SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 2 of the JSON dat this is my code http://pastebin.com/dWx3up0h
[16:01:58] <robertmaxrees> tinkiete ask in #php how to output without the []
[16:02:27] <openyk> tinkiettinkiete i do lots of php response without the brackets
[16:02:47] <openyk> json_encode($json) is the key
[16:03:02] <openyk> on the php script
[16:03:32] <tinkiete> im using json_encode ,
[16:03:41] <robertmaxrees> could you guys take it to PM?
[16:03:57] <tinkiete>   $data['content'] = $val[0]['content'];              array_push($array, $data);         echo json_encode($array);
[16:04:01] <tinkiete> this is what i did
[16:06:22] <openyk> test with $json = array(); and $json[0]['test'] = 'yes';
[16:07:00] <openyk> I sense some iffiness in the php
[16:07:46] <JovanJ> I've file.name and I need to pass it on $_POST so i can get that value, how I am supposed to do that?
[16:08:05] <robertmaxrees> JovanJ i answered this question for you already.  what didn't work about it?
[16:08:31] <openyk> oh  tink also you can JSON.stringify
[16:08:32] <JovanJ> robertmaxress , I am not sure what should i write where.. can you help me about it?
[16:08:36] <robertmaxrees> JovanJ just post the data... $.post('url', file.name);
[16:09:12] <tinkiete> openyk: oki, im gonna try the json.stringify then
[16:09:39] <shoky> tinkiete did you try just using "data" without parsing it, in the ajax code
[16:10:05] <tinkiete> yeah, i got objecyt
[16:10:07] <tinkiete> object
[16:10:12] <shoky> then it's already parsed
[16:10:14] <shoky> there you go.
[16:10:22] <JovanJ> 'url' is actually url of my page, right?
[16:10:22] <robertmaxrees> don't parse what's already and object.
[16:10:30] <robertmaxrees> JovanJ yeah, whatever URL you're posting to.
[16:12:43] <JovanJ> It won't work. When I've $('<p/').text(file.name).appendTo(document.body); it works
[16:12:50] <JovanJ> but when i try $.post, it's not working...
[16:12:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:13:05] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[16:13:09] <JovanJ> Nothing...
[16:13:19] <tinkiete> shoky: teh why i got this error then SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 2 of the JSON data
[16:13:41] <shoky> tinkiete: you get that error when?
[16:14:01] <louism2wash> Hey guys, I'm trying to use a for loop to creating an image sliding effect but I the image doesn't 'animate' until after the loop has completed and just moves the picture to it's expected final position all at once rather than by sliding it.  Any ideas?  Thanks.  http://jsfiddle.net/uhyw0ok8/2/
[16:14:20] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash why aren't you using a method made for animating things?
[16:14:22] <robertmaxrees> like animate()?
[16:14:40] <tinkiete> when i try ro use the object
[16:15:05] <tinkiete> shoky: with this   var obj=  $.parseJSON(data);
[16:15:14] <shoky> tinkiete: i told you to not do that
[16:15:23] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: it's about trying to understand why it won't work.  Seems way to "simple" a task for it to be causing me this much pain.
[16:15:28] <openyk> var obj = data;
[16:15:34] <shoky> or just use data
[16:15:43] <shoky> instead of obj
[16:15:45] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash because it's going so quickly there's no animation to be seen.
[16:15:55] <robertmaxrees> it just goes.
[16:16:02] <openyk> data.content
[16:16:04] <robertmaxrees> that's why we use things like .animate() or css transitions.
[16:16:07] <robertmaxrees> that's why they're there.
[16:16:21] <shoky> data[0].content if it's an array
[16:16:57] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: even when I insert a function call to "sleep" the loop for a second during each iteration it still doesn't work.
[16:17:10] <tinkiete> openyk: thnx for the help
[16:19:27] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash how are you trying to sleep in the loop?
[16:20:48] <robertmaxrees> because something tells me it's not working the way you think it is.
[16:21:16] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: let me update the js fiddle I appreciate the help
[16:22:00] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash trust me though, just use .animate() or something similar.
[16:23:04] <tinkiete> openyk: shoky it doesnt work with data.content, but i have to do this , $.each(obj, function() { 	      result = this['content'] ; 	  });
[16:23:10] <tinkiete> else it doesnt work
[16:23:21] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: I want to create a swipe effect where one images swipes across the screen to the left while another image takes its place.  I figured I would have trouble getting the two events to sync up nicely using animate which is how I got down this path in the first place
[16:23:40] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash not at all.  you want a carousel.
[16:23:53] <openyk> tinkiete have you tried shoky's suggestion with data[0].content
[16:24:25] <robertmaxrees> these are common.  use a prebuilt one.  alternatively, .animate() is async, so you can do multiple calls and they'll run simultaneously.
[16:25:23] <tinkiete> openyk: its oki its works
[16:26:01] <frank_o> shoky: kickass solution man thanks again !!
[16:26:03] <tinkiete> thnx again
[16:26:54] <guideX> I am using a fancybox, but then I set the opacity of the div to 0.2, and listen for that, problem is, the fancy box gets called first, regaurdless of my if statement with the opacity
[16:27:04] <guideX> any idea how to listen to it and cancel the fancybox if I want to?
[16:27:15] <guideX> cause right now, it doesn't hit the if statement at all
[16:28:33] <frank_o> guideX: got a live testcase for us?
[16:28:42] <frank_o> shoky: heres that movie i was telling you about: https://soundcloud.com/user544268436
[16:28:52] <frank_o> oops wrong link nevermind that :S
[16:29:10] <frank_o> shoky: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10104704/Bethlehem.2013.DVDRip.x264.HORiZON-ArtSubs
[16:29:34] <guideX> I do not.. it's a complex set of scenarios with php zend, and a show more button which builds items dynamically
[16:29:43] <frank_o> maybe i shouldnt post tpb here in jq sorry if i offended anyone
[16:29:44] <guideX> it would be extremely difficult to live reproduce the problem..
[16:30:06] <tinkiete> thnx for all
[16:30:10] <tinkiete> good night
[16:30:12] <tinkiete> bye
[16:31:13] <frank_o> guideX: nevermind that, just reduce it down to the bare minimum html, css and js
[16:31:51] <guideX> hmm ok i'll try to do that
[16:32:35] <frank_o> guideX: have you seen http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ btw?
[16:36:34] <robertmaxrees> frank_o that's a fantastic guide
[16:36:37] <robertmaxrees> ++
[16:37:18] <guideX> hmm i'll check it out
[16:37:31] <guideX> problem is, with this site, it's hard to separate the data from the site..
[16:37:47] <guideX> fancybox library is a problem too
[16:37:55] <guideX> kind of hard to make a test case of it
[16:38:08] <JovanJ> Why does it happens when I upload something on one computer and go on another, that image appears on page as I uploaded it on other computer?
[16:40:14] <guideX> well, the test case is coming, but any idea how to better control which event fires first? fancybox prevents my other even from firing
[16:40:21] <robertmaxrees> JovanJ hrm
[16:40:34] <robertmaxrees> JovanJ are you using meteor or something?
[16:40:59] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: ok, I'll take a look at carousel and mess around with animate.  Here is what I have using a for loop with a sleep function:  http://jsfiddle.net/louism2/26oyuozv/3/
[16:41:16] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: carousel is awesome by the way :)
[16:41:19] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash there are a lot of carousels out there - they'll handle exactly what you want.
[16:41:40] <robertmaxrees> that sleep isn't doing what you think.
[16:41:52] <robertmaxrees> it runs the sleep and then keeps going.
[16:42:00] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't stop the for loop from running.
[16:42:25] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3583724/how-do-i-add-a-delay-in-a-javascript-loop
[16:43:07] <robertmaxrees> but really, you want something like http://bxslider.com/examples/thumbnail-pager-1
[16:44:16] <openyk> just popped back to say things are making sense and working with less hair-pulling- ty shoky and robert, ttyl
[16:44:59] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: awesome, thanks.  That's slick and very easy to implement.  I'll take a look at that timeout SO post you sent.  I'm sure I'll end up using one of the solutions you showed me but I just really want to figure out what I was doing wrong.  Appreciate the help.
[16:46:21] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash the issue is literally that the for loop runs so quickly you don't see the effect.  your sleep method doesn't work because the for loop keeps running - it's just creating new objects.
[16:46:43] <robertmaxrees> you need to create a timeout/interval that calls your logic explicitly, instead.
[16:56:31] <kevin> leaving work deuces
[16:58:19] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: Cool, I'll just create a recursive function instead.
[16:59:02] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, what you want is a carousel lol why are you so resistant to using one?
[17:02:23] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: I'm not resistant, I just want to be able to figure out why my code wouldn't work
[17:02:29] <shoky> thanks for the link frank_o, added to my watchlist ;]
[17:02:44] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: I appreciate the help
[17:03:23] <frank_o> o/
[17:14:46] <guideX> $(".gallery ul li img").click(function(e) { ... any idea why this wouldn't be called if the item is created dynamically
[17:15:04] <robertmaxrees> because the element doesn't exist.
[17:15:08] <robertmaxrees> nothing to bind to.
[17:15:11] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[17:15:33] <guideX> hmm ok
[17:15:51] <robertmaxrees> the docs for .on() explain direct and delegated events
[17:15:57] <shebbi> guideX: try: $(document).on('click', '.gallery ul li img', function(e){});
[17:16:04] <guideX> ah ok thanks
[17:16:16] <robertmaxrees> bind lower down than document if you can though
[17:16:57] <guideX> yeah there's a div I can use :)
[17:17:15] <guideX> actually I can bind to .gallery
[17:18:31] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[17:20:50] <guideX> hmm still not working, gah that's weird.. oh well i'll figure it out
[17:20:59] <robertmaxrees> does .gallery get added later, too?
[17:21:24] <guideX> nah .gallery is there first, I also tried document
[17:21:35] <robertmaxrees> then your selector is probably bad.
[17:21:49] <guideX> but it works fine on elements which exist when the page loads
[17:22:00] <guideX> maybe there's something missing on those items... weird
[17:22:26] <robertmaxrees> it only matters which element you bind to.
[17:22:35] <robertmaxrees> the document will exist, so that should be fine.
[17:22:51] <robertmaxrees> try just '.gallery ul li' on that second arg.
[17:23:06] <guideX> ok
[17:30:47] <guideX> ah ok, because I don't have .on in my jquery verison..
[17:30:54] <robertmaxrees> woah what.
[17:31:02] <robertmaxrees> what version are you on?
[17:31:04] <guideX> I used live, now it works.. last problem though, with live, if I use this, it's not the object I'm expecting
[17:31:08] <guideX> let me check..
[17:31:16] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.jquery should tell you.
[17:32:04] <guideX> 1.5.2
[17:32:07] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[17:32:14] <robertmaxrees> any way you can update?
[17:32:17] <guideX> yeah I work with a lot of old projects heh
[17:32:34] <guideX> I could, but then would mean a lot of rewriting broken code
[17:32:53] <robertmaxrees> i did a migration a few months ago for two of our three frontend platforms.
[17:32:56] <robertmaxrees> it was well worth it.
[17:33:07] <guideX> the bigger problem is all the libraries
[17:33:16] <guideX> the older jquery libraries and such
[17:33:26] <robertmaxrees> most of those should have drop-in replacements.  the other fix is the jquery migrate plugin.
[17:34:09] <guideX> hmm, do you know about the this problem?
[17:34:18] <robertmaxrees> "the this problem"?
[17:34:22] <guideX> inside my live, If I use this, it's a diffe4ent object now
[17:34:36] <guideX> so before I did like $("blah").click(function(e) { and it was that object
[17:34:41] <guideX> but now it appears to be something else
[17:34:47] <sammych> this => function scope
[17:34:56] <robertmaxrees> $(this) should still be that element.
[17:35:09] <guideX> hmm ok
[17:35:13] <robertmaxrees> if it's not, use .delegate() instead.
[17:35:38] <guideX> ok
[17:36:55] <guideX> ah I see why, this isn't the object, it's the .gallery object
[17:37:50] <guideX> and delegate isn't working
[17:38:12] <guideX> I mean, no error, just doesn't bind to anything
[17:38:15] <robertmaxrees> then your gallery object is getting cloned strangely.
[17:38:34] <guideX> with live, is there a way to get the li I am expecting?
[17:38:35] <robertmaxrees> bind to document in that case.
[17:38:37] <robertmaxrees> see if that works.
[17:38:39] <guideX> ok
[17:49:00] <guideX> ah cool, looks like you can use e.target.name
[17:49:14] <robertmaxrees> event.target will be the element that emitted the event, yeah.
[17:49:23] <guideX> ah cool
[17:50:23] <guideX> annnnnd it works :D
[17:50:26] <guideX> thanks guys
[17:51:26] <guideX> thanks robertmaxrees esp
[18:25:18] <melvinrram> I'm trying to use $.Deferred() to make a processing queue but I'm having some issues. Here's what I'd like to have happen. We have a queue object that is basically an array. As things happen on the page, functions and their arguments are added to this queue. They process as soon as they are added. If something new is added, it doesn't start process
[18:25:18] <melvinrram> ing until the current item is not done. I am having trouble wrapping my head around how to do this conceptually. I'm guessing deferreds are going to be involved but I'm not clear on how to go about it.
[18:25:57] <melvinrram> Is there a library that basically already allows for this?
[18:57:48] <AzMoo> Hello. I'm using $.get() to make a number of requests. Is there a way I can have a callback fire when all of those requests are complete, rather than just the individual request?
[18:58:46] <BillCriswell> AzMoo: You can use .when()
[18:58:59] <AzMoo> BillCriswell: I'll check it out, cheers.
[19:00:03] <BillCriswell> AzMoo: So like... var requests = [ $.get('/foo'), $.get('/bar') ]; $.when.apply($, requests).done(function(){ /* ALLLLLLLL DONE */ });
[19:01:42] <AzMoo> BillCriswell: That's perfect, thanks heaps.
[19:01:50] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[21:22:08] <Hyperking> greetings, I have a small issue removing a class from elements when on home page of site
[21:22:19] <Hyperking> here is my code example https://bpaste.net/show/ac29457c84e0
[21:22:52] <Hyperking> How would I remove class values from elements when on the home page?
[21:23:14] <Hyperking> currently all other pages work nicely, but the home page doesn't
[21:23:34] <Hyperking> not sure what im missing
[22:02:43] <trodis> $('#currentConstructions li:not(p)').on("click", function()... is not working correct, i want the <p> elements ignored from the selector $(this).text() is taking the <p> elements too, thats not what i want
[22:05:28] <AzMoo> trodis: The p elements are ignored from your selector. You're only actually selecting li's. Where are you seeing the p elements?
[22:06:51] <trodis> ok to show the whole
[22:07:03] <trodis>         $('#currentConstructions').append('<li> <a href="">'+ construction_name +'<p>'+ owner +'</p></a></li>');
[22:07:05] <trodis>         $('#currentConstructions').listview('refresh');
[22:07:08] <AzMoo>  ope
[22:07:10] <AzMoo> use a pastebin
[22:07:25] <trodis>     $('#currentConstructions li:first-child').on("click", function(){
[22:07:48] <trodis> yeah sry next time ill use pastebin
[22:08:51] <trodis> so the prob is, i dont want the p element gets selected from the element that is clicked in the listview
[22:28:45] <AzMoo> trodis: But that's the thing, you're not selecting the p element. You're selecting the li element and that grabs the p as well because it's a child.
[22:29:02] <AzMoo> sorry, bad explanation
[22:29:06] <AzMoo> it's not selecting the p as well.
[22:29:19] <AzMoo> the selected li contains the p.
[22:32:50] <eee3n> hi?
[22:34:27] <eee3n> Need help with my code. I'm adding a draggable code to a symbol in EDGE. When I preview it in the browser and click on it, it'll drag but the symbol jumps like 2 inches away from my cursor.
[22:53:15] <Bauer> morning guys :) how do I make this .each function access the array outside its scope? var arr; $('.inputFields').each(function(i) {arr.push( $( this ).val()); } ); arr;
[22:53:26] <Bauer> I want to collect array of values for a POST
[22:56:00] <doug_> Bauer: ?
[22:56:18] <doug_> Bauer: do that, but do something with 'arr' instead of "arr;"
[22:56:42] <doug_> ah
[22:56:48] <doug_> change it to var arr = [];
[22:56:49] <Bauer> doug_: my problem is that I get TypeError: Cannot read property 'push' of undefined
[22:56:57] <Bauer> ahhh, one sec
[22:57:23] <Bauer> doug_: still the scoping issue, arr remains empty
[22:57:36] <doug_> there's no scoping issue...
[22:58:41] <Bauer> doug_: its not working, not even inside the iterator: var arr = []; $('.inputFields').each(function(i) {arr.push( $( this ).val()); console.log ($( this ).val() );} ); arr;
[22:58:47] <Bauer> ohh sec
[22:59:38] <Bauer> only one input (select box) works, the rest are empty strings
[23:00:00] <Bauer> actually its right, thanks doug_! :)
[23:00:13] <Bauer> forgot I reloaded the page, fields were empty :P
[23:00:32] <doug_> great
[23:03:15] <Bauer> doug_: now further modification is not working: var arr = []; $('.inputFields').each(function(i) { arr[$(this).attr('id')] =  $( this ).val(); } ); arr;
[23:03:48] <doug_> Bauer: use $.map http://jsfiddle.net/30gywero/
[23:04:04] <doug_> it was made for making arrays from iterating arrays
[23:05:29] <Bauer> hmmm, I think no.. I need to make assoc array like arr[input1] = value1; etc
[23:05:46] <doug_> ah
[23:06:34] <doug_> why attr('id') ... shouldnt that be attr('name')
[23:06:54] <Bauer> the attribute I want as the key is the element's ID
[23:07:22] <Bauer> actually I dont have a name element
[23:07:25] <Bauer> attribute*
[23:08:17] <doug_> that restricts you to only one per page - it is illegal to have duplicate ids
[23:08:20] <doug_> but ok
[23:08:46] <hypfer_office> hello, I'd like to concant multiple tables and export (download) the result. is that possible with jquery?
[23:08:48] <Bauer> I dont have duplicate IDs.. they are unique per each element
[23:10:44] <Bauer> doug_: so why is var arr = []; $('.inputFields').each(function(i) { arr[$(this).attr('id')] =  $( this ).val(); } ); arr; not working? the array remains empty
[23:14:34] <doug_> Bauer: http://jsfiddle.net/30gywero/1/
[23:15:56] <Bauer> huh doug_, why have you changes values to object using {}, instead of array as we did before []?
[23:16:35] <doug_> because you are creating an object, not an array
[23:17:06] <Bauer> I dont understand, why do I need an object, and not an array?
[23:17:50] <doug_> arrays have a special length property, and a prototype to manipulate it in various ways
[23:17:59] <doug_> you won't be using the array part
[23:18:13] <doug_> it will just confuse developers that work on the code too
[23:19:18] <Bauer> hmmm, so you created an object that has attributes with the values in it.. hmm
[23:19:22] <doug_> Bauer: in javascript, objects are just a bunch of key/value pairs
[23:20:36] <doug_> js> var myObject = {}; myObject.name = 'doug'; myObject.role = 'admin'; for (var k in myObject) print(k, myObject[k]);
[23:20:38] <Bauer> actually thats great, my end goal is something like: {            username:username,            profile:profile,            commonName:commonName,            sureName:sureName        }
[23:20:41] <b-ot> doug_: name doug role admin
[23:22:00] <Bauer> I will adjust it for me now, thanks doug_! :)
[23:22:08] <doug_> np
[23:25:53] <Zak> is there a nice way to check whether a jquery object is empty or not?
[23:25:58] <Zak> e.g. $().exists()
[23:26:10] <Zak> I'm currently using length, but it feels wrong
[23:43:04] <doug_> Zak: it's not wrong
[23:45:50] <Zak> is there a better function or property?
[23:46:04] <Zak> the reason I don't like it, is because it falls back to JS's truthy crap
[23:46:09] <Zak> where 0 just happens to be falsey
[23:46:24] <Zak> i'd much rather just have a variable that just returned true/false
[23:46:38] <Zak> ofc, I could just do !!$().length, but that feels worse
[23:46:50] <Zak> it's probably an issue for me too, just from a readability standpoint
[23:54:33] <Cork> Zak: you could always write a small extension to do it
[23:55:07] <Cork> Zak: $.fn.isEmpty = function() { return this.length < 1; }
[23:56:47] <doug_> zak add http://jsfiddle.net/Ly3e462c/2/it:
[23:57:00] <doug_> Cork: lol
[23:57:36] <doug_> well, it was the obvious answer
