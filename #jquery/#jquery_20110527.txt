[00:09:19] <noderat> I'm having issues with jQuery-UI Dialog, in IE6 it's close button is hidden and buttons are not able to be clicked (http://horizondigital.com click on any link in the navigation to show dialog)
[00:09:37] <RWOverdijk_> If I do this:  $('selector').addClass('class').text('text').css('display', 'block'); And 'selector
[00:09:41] <izepstan> anyone experience with "
[00:09:41] <izepstan> jQuery Bubble Popup"?
[00:09:47] <RWOverdijk_> ' does not exist. Will jquery handle this internally ?
[00:10:02] <RWOverdijk_> Or will I get a bunch of errors in my console
[00:11:13] <wkmanire> RWOverdijk_: If your selector finds nothing to work on it should not cause problems.
[00:11:28] <wkmanire> But some 3rd party plugins might give you trouble
[00:12:50] <jomofcw> Morning !
[00:13:25] <RWOverdijk_> wkmanire, merci
[00:13:59] <wkmanire> RWOverdijk_: Por nada. :)
[00:14:24] <RWOverdijk_> ?
[00:14:34] <RWOverdijk_> What language is that
[00:14:37] <RWOverdijk_> SPanish?
[00:14:40] <wkmanire> Portuguese.
[00:14:42] <wkmanire> ;)
[00:14:45] <RWOverdijk_> ah right
[00:20:11] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/eSB8C/5/ what i'm trying to accomplish is a dynamic content area loader, my logic is that I need to have two variables, for for the currentTab, and one for the newCurrentTab to track where the click came from. When the link is clicked the currentActive will be set to class .panel, and the newCurrentTab will be set to class ".active" but i'm having a really hard time implementing
[00:20:11] <luchenbill> this idea
[00:28:01] <izepstan> is there maybe a jquery plugin wich allows me to show bubble popups on specific locations on a map wich can be triggered from outside?
[00:28:39] <wkmanire> going down for an upgrade, back in a few
[00:37:14] <gnarf> izepstan: i haven't heard of one
[00:37:43] <gnarf> anyone alive in here
[00:37:48] <gnarf> doing anything fun with jQueries?
[00:39:23] <gnarf> bot-t: Will anyone talk to me?
[00:39:23] <bot-t> gnarf, Ask again later.
[00:39:27] * gnarf frowns
[00:41:33] <gnarf> bot-t: is it singles night in #jquery?
[00:41:34] <bot-t> gnarf, Better not tell you now.
[00:41:44] <gnarf> good point bot-t
[00:42:26] <coldhead> christians, i am making a superlative chili con carne here
[00:42:34] <coldhead> don't let me forget and burn it
[00:43:34] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/eSB8C/5/ what i'm trying to accomplish is a dynamic content area loader, my logic is that I need to have two variables, for for the currentTab, and one for the newCurrentTab to track where the click came from. When the link is clicked the currentActive will be set to class .panel, and the newCurrentTab will be set to class ".active" but i'm having a really hard time implementing
[00:43:34] <luchenbill> this idea
[00:43:51] <izepstan> gnarf: the jquery bubbletip has the option " positionAtElement: " but the plugin sucks... the jquery bubble popup is very nice, but without this function...
[00:44:31] <gnarf> ?tabs @luchenbill
[00:44:32] <bot-t> luchenbill, UI/API/1.8/Tabs - Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space, much like an accordion. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[00:45:45] <gnarf> luchenbill: but, having said that, what have you tried to do and why is it failing?
[00:47:05] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/2LECB/ @luchenbill
[00:54:59] <luchenbill> gnarf yeah how did you do that without anything in there?
[00:55:18] <gnarf> luchenbill: ajax content
[00:55:26] <gnarf> luchenbill: just one of the awesome features of tabs
[00:55:30] <luchenbill> gnarf, I'm basically making tabs I guess, but not really, I just have a little website where I would like to make a single background with a menu, and the content will load dynamic
[00:55:37] <gnarf> why reinvent a wheel already written?
[00:55:45] <luchenbill> I am just trying to learn sir
[00:55:52] <gnarf> fair enough
[00:56:00] <luchenbill> I like to understand exactly how things work
[00:56:01] <gnarf> look at the code for tabs?
[00:56:16] <luchenbill> and right now I feel like i'm super close, all I nee dto do is what i'm thinking, I just cant quite get it going...
[00:56:16] <luchenbill> lol
[00:57:08] <luchenbill> where is the ajax code in your fiddle example?
[01:00:40] <gnarf> luchenbill: in tabs
[01:00:49] <gnarf> luchenbill: notice the urls of the <a>'s
[01:02:51] <luchenbill> yeah but there is no css or anything?
[01:06:48] <sumeetjain> I'm loading a form from another page into a jquery-ui dialog box. What's the best practice for applying datepicker() to one of the loaded form elements? I'm running $("#the_element").datepicker() after initializing the dialog, but it's not taking. Is there some callback method that I can use after the dialog is intialized?
[01:08:49] <anli_> Is there an event occuring in a selectbox when an option is removed programmatically?
[01:10:00] <sumeetjain> anli_: That's an interesting question. Does .change() not fire?
[01:10:40] <anli_> no
[01:10:51] <anli_> Seems that I need to hook append() then
[01:10:59] <anli_> And for every option that is appended hook remove()
[01:11:02] <anli_> Thats easy, isnt it?
[01:12:59] <anli_> Or wait, there is an easier way
[01:14:21] <markj> sumeetjain
[01:14:27] <anli_> tada!
[01:14:34] <markj> there is a create event
[01:14:42] <markj> check the events tab on the dialog page
[01:15:14] <sumeetjain> markj: I'm embarrassed to have asked the question. I just needed to put the datepicker() in the callback for load().
[01:15:25] <sumeetjain> markj: Yes, that would have worked too. Thanks for the response.
[01:15:33] <anli_> solution: http://jsfiddle.net/7n9ev/
[01:15:45] <anli_> How I love jquery
[01:16:27] <gnarf> luchenbill: all a part of the CSS framework
[01:16:51] <gnarf> sumeetjain: after the element is appended?
[01:17:05] <gnarf> anli_: what is removing it?
[01:17:14] <anli_> my code
[01:17:23] <anli_> And I dont want to call .change on the selectbox
[01:17:27] <anli_> manually
[01:17:39] <gnarf> anli_: .parent().trigger("removeOption").end()
[01:17:47] <anli_> But as you could see, there is a solution for me
[01:18:25] <gnarf> and then bind the removeOption event
[01:18:33] <gnarf> actually that should be all lowercase
[01:18:34] <gnarf> sry
[01:19:55] <gnarf> duck punching .remove() is probably not the best solution you have
[01:19:57] <gnarf> sure it works
[01:20:13] <gnarf> but its a absolutely last resort kinda thing
[01:21:04] <anli_> why? I expected change to fire when I removed an option in the first place
[01:21:12] <anli_> So I want change to behave differently
[01:21:26] <anli_> Its only half a function as it is
[01:23:48] <etfb> Looking for a good, simple menubar + dropdown menus, using <ul><li> for the initial structure, but NOT one that relies on hover effects.  I want to click to open and click elsewhere on the page to close.  Anyone seen such a thing?
[01:23:50] <DarsVaeda> hi, I do a jquery ui object.effect() when this effect has finished I want to do another action, how do I achieve this? is it possible?
[01:26:25] <anli_> etfb: seems like you have to make one by hand
[01:26:32] <DarsVaeda> never mind, it works with .ready ... just a typo
[01:27:30] <etfb> anli_: It's probably simple enough, but I was hoping to just plug it in.  I was amazed at how many examples out there get something as simple as that completely wrong.  (Yes, wrong: I consider poor usability to be a measurable quantity.)
[01:28:59] <anli_> maybe there is a 100 of plugins for your, but after you have sought one out, you were maybe able to create a more adequate menu yourself
[01:29:17] <anli_> I am not aware of those plugins
[01:29:24] <anli_> eh, which you can pick
[01:29:49] <izepstan> how can i get dynamically the $('#div') from mouseover?
[01:29:50] <etfb> I'll give it a try then.
[01:30:56] <anli_> you have an event object in the handler
[01:31:08] <anli_> Then you can get the target from that event
[01:31:14] <anli_> In different ways depending on browser
[01:31:30] <anli_> $(typeof event.target != 'undefined' ? event.target : event.srcElement);
[01:32:11] <anli_> The event object is passed as an argument to the handler
[01:32:23] <Jax> hello
[01:32:32] <Jax> how do i get the tag name of what i selected?
[01:32:41] <anli_> foo.attr('tagName');
[01:32:58] <anli_> Why do you want it?
[01:33:09] <Jax> ah that was it
[01:33:15] <Jax> i just did tagName
[01:33:19] <anli_> Maybe you do it in the wrong way if you want that
[01:33:23] <Jax> just for checking that i'm selecting the right element
[01:33:35] <anli_> How can another element be selected?
[01:35:54] <gnarf> foo[0].nodeName
[01:36:04] <anli_> Aha
[01:36:16] <anli_> Still, there is a queston why the tag name is really needed
[01:36:19] <gnarf> better than attr any day, not prone to 1.6 issues, and fastest
[01:36:42] <anli_> Seems that Jax is letting an event happen in an inappropriate element
[01:36:44] <gnarf> doesn't stop the fact that .attr('tagName') is wrong advice ;)
[01:36:59] <Jax> .... i'm just debugging
[01:37:03] <Jax> i'm not using that in any code
[01:37:06] <anli_> Hehe, not really, the advice is to not let a semiincorrect event fire
[01:37:11] <anli_> aha
[01:37:23] <anli_> That makes things better
[01:38:01] <izepstan> thx, if this.id contains something like #map_country or #link_country, how can i strip link_ and map_?
[01:38:23] <gnarf> ?js "map_country".split("_").pop();
[01:38:24] <bot-t> gnarf: "country"
[01:38:39] <anli_> $('#map_country, #link_country').hide();
[01:38:42] <etfb> Dumb newbie question: if I do something like $('#foo').click(fn1), and then $('#foo').click(fn2) (where fn1 and fn2 are two different functions) does that mean the #foo object will call both functions, or only the second one?
[01:38:45] <anli_> hehe
[01:39:00] <gnarf> etfb: first then second
[01:39:25] <etfb> gnarf: Oh good.  And what if I want to deactivate fn2, and have #foo go back to only executing fn1 on click?
[01:41:43] <toxz> hi! does anyone knows a tutorial how to manage big jquery code? in multiple files or automatic called functions - whatever
[01:42:09] <coldhead> ?unbind @ etfb
[01:42:09] <bot-t> etfb, .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[01:42:36] <gnarf> etfb: then you're doing it wrong probably ;) can you explain the case a bit better?
[01:42:49] <gnarf> i find needing to use .unbind() usually leading towards code smell
[01:42:56] <coldhead> toxz: http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/on-jquery-large-applications
[01:42:58] <etfb`> Sorry, lost internet connectivity there.  What was that?
[01:42:59] <gnarf> (not to say there aren't uses)
[01:43:51] <etfb`> Ah, I see what you're saying. Yes, definitely a code smell.

[01:44:16] <etfb`> OK, what I want is for a click on #menu to open my menu (easy) and a click absolutely everywhere else to close it.
[01:44:17] <coldhead> toxz: that should get you started
[01:44:19] <Jax> how can i get all <input type="checkbox" inside an element
[01:44:28] <toxz> coldhead: thx a lot
[01:44:40] <coldhead> $(elem).find(':checkbox')
[01:45:10] <coldhead> $(':checkbox', elem)
[01:45:12] <Jax> can i also toggle their checkbox status directly?
[01:45:43] <coldhead> i think you might have to use ?each // for that
[01:45:43] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[01:46:37] <gnarf> ?outside events
[01:46:38] <bot-t> gnarf, jQuery outside events | jQuery Plugins - With jQuery outside events you can bind to an event that will be triggered only when a specific ìoriginatingî event occurs outside the element in question. For example, you can click outside, doubl... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ba-jquery-outside-events-plugin
[01:47:00] <gnarf> ben alman to the rescue etfb` ^^^^
[01:47:29] <etfb`> Ah! Perfect, gnarf.  I don't know the name Ben Alman, but I have a feeling I'm about to.
[01:49:03] <coldhead> etfb`: most things you or anyone else will write in jQUery have already been written by ben alman
[01:52:21] <etfb`> Heh.
[01:52:50] <etfb`> Of course, I still wonder how to remove the event, but I guess I can make it harmless when the menu isn't already open.
[01:53:18] <keirl> can anyone please tell me how to set a delay before an element animates after a click function is executed?
[01:55:07] <d1g1t4l> keirl, set the timer on click and put your animation in the timer trigger function
[01:57:13] <gnarf> ?delay @keirl
[01:57:13] <bot-t> keirl, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/

[02:05:56] <dtach> http://jsfiddle.net/662UR/ this result in the date showing as it should when i have 1 element .fuzzydate but when i have more (and also more .inTheatersDate) it results in putting in all the .inTheatersDate it can find on the page
[02:06:26] <izepstan> haha
[02:06:30] <izepstan> nice
[02:06:42] <etfb`> izepstan: It can be a "gotcha" in JavaScript.  (1+2) and ("1"+2) and (1+"2") don't all do exactly what you expect, if I remember correctly.
[02:06:51] <dtach> http://jsfiddle.net/662UR/1/ i added the structure of the elements
[02:07:20] <etfb`> izepstan: It would be better to have an explicit concatenation operator like SQL's ||, but it's too late now...

[02:54:34] <jeroenem> Hi... jQuery UI tabs respond to an anchor like "#tab-1", "#tab-2", etc... is there a way to get rid of this way and make it respond to a specific class instead of an anchor?
[02:56:15] <jeroenem> http://jsfiddle.net/g3REM/
[03:02:19] <shoonya> i have a form which fetches data from db. the user can select a field (textbox) and can change/modify the value if required. Now, the issue is that for some reason when the uses selects (on focus) a field, the previous value gets cleared
[03:02:49] <wilrod> Hey, I need to read rss through ajax but I get the warning that says "The page is accessing information...", what to do?
[03:02:50] <shoonya> how to make the textbox not clear the previous value on selection
[03:03:01] <shoonya> can someone help me on this
[03:06:30] <izepstan> how do i check isset?
[03:08:22] <eml> jeroenem: Remember to include jquery and jquery-ui in your jsfiddles. I updated it to do so
[03:08:53] <jeroenem> eml, yes i know... but i pasted it just to show the HTML
[03:10:09] <eml> jeroenem: Still. Looking at http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs#options it seems that you're stuck with IDs. Pretty logical to me since you want to have your different tabs' identifiers be unique
[03:11:14] <jeroenem> eml, sure thing. But in my case the basetag in my document ruins the hashed anchors... #tabs-1 becomes /homepage/#tabs-1 which results in jQuery UI loading the entire HTML markup in the rotating tab
[03:12:10] <jeroenem> so i was wondering if there is a way to do the same, without using anchors with the source attribute
[03:12:15] <izepstan> var str = "test_23";
[03:12:15] <izepstan> alert(str.split("_").pop());
[03:12:30] <izepstan> what if i wanna get test instead of 23?
[03:13:07] <eml> izepstan: str.split returns an array, so str.split("_")[0] ?

[03:23:44] <shoonya> how to remove clear textbox behavior on focus/click using jquery ?

[03:26:10] <shoonya>     this.select(id);
[03:26:10] <shoonya> });
[03:27:05] <shoonya> eml: this seem to be working, but for all textbox and it is also removing other jquery functions like tooltip (for eg) for other fields
[03:30:45] <eml> shoonya: I don't even know what this "clear textbox behavior on focus/click" is. My textboxes aren't cleared when I focus/click them

[04:00:15] <ravenzz> otherwise ?p
[04:00:30] <ravenzz> sure
[04:00:39] <ravenzz> where is your code Cheery?
[04:01:08] <Cheery> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/396113 <- ravenzz there.
[04:01:13] <markj> ?unbind @ Cheery
[04:01:13] <bot-t> Cheery, .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[04:01:54] <ravenzz> that's more than i should inspect
[04:02:24] <Cheery> ravenzz: don't freak when you get more when you should. anyway I got the answer already :)
[04:02:52] <ravenzz> have fun
[04:10:39] <izepstan> anyone can take a look at my js please: http://jsfiddle.net/izepstan/aDfEd/2/
[04:11:29] <eml> izepstan: How about you provide some html
[04:11:53] <izepstan> the html contains images wich i dont can upload...
[04:12:07] <izepstan> its a map with some div locations
[04:12:30] <izepstan> and some links wich also should display the tooltips on the map
[04:13:00] <izepstan> should i upload it to a webserver?
[04:14:45] <izepstan> ok i added some of the html
[04:14:46] <izepstan> http://jsfiddle.net/izepstan/aDfEd/4/
[04:15:32] <ravenzz> so
[04:15:36] <ravenzz> what's your issue?
[04:16:24] <izepstan> only one thing work, either the links or the map dependend on first mouseover
[04:17:13] <izepstan> should i make a screenshot?
[04:19:46] <ravenzz> have you took a look at http://www.uhleeka.com/demo/bubbletip/ ?
[04:21:05] <BlaDe^> Error: $ is not defined ---   Line: 3
[04:21:12] <BlaDe^> I get this in Firefox only, since upgrading to JQuery 1.6.0 -- any ideas why?
[04:21:27] <ravenzz> are you using other libraries?
[04:21:32] <BlaDe^> no
[04:21:41] <BlaDe^> I believe it's because of: Error: c.defaultView.getComputedStyle(h, null) is null -- Line: 16
[04:21:46] <ravenzz> do you load jquery before all?
[04:22:01] <BlaDe^> before all JS files? yes
[04:22:23] <ravenzz> do you run your snippet on document ready?
[04:23:16] <BlaDe^> thats what's erroring, ravenzz
[04:23:22] <BlaDe^> $(document).ready(function() {  <-- it doesn't like the $ it ays it's undefined
[04:23:27] <izepstan> ravenzz: yeah i got my code from there
[04:23:46] <BlaDe^> It works in all other browsers except FF, ravenzz
[04:23:51] <ravenzz> BlaDe^ have you got a live example?
[04:24:04] <Shwaiil> Q: For $(a).live({... click : fn(e) { $(e).attr('href') ... shouldnt this give me the href ? thanks
[04:24:10] <BlaDe^> ravenzz I have, can I notice/pm you it though please?
[04:24:29] <ravenzz> yes
[04:27:35] <gym_jane> hi all
[04:27:52] <gym_jane> my site just got defaced, folks telling me its to do with my jquery form validation
[04:28:15] <gym_jane> here is relevant jquery http://pastebin.com/hhXHW3kL
[04:28:18] <markj> its more likely you're not sanitizing the input on the server
[04:28:46] <ravenzz> gym_jane tipically is a bad server-side validation process
[04:28:57] <ravenzz> you don't trust enought in js validation
[04:29:04] <ravenzz> becouse that's client-side
[04:29:26] <gym_jane> ok, but can that code be exploited?
[04:29:32] <gym_jane> i had my index.html overwritten
[04:29:33] <ravenzz> sure
[04:29:56] <ravenzz> you can bypass an client-side validation easily
[04:30:05] <gym_jane> but can could someone overwrite a file :/
[04:30:51] <ravenzz> by sending some malicious code
[04:31:21] <ravenzz> you should have a strong validation server-side...don't trust in client-side validation
[04:32:39] <gym_jane> ok
[04:33:33] <ravenzz> consider client-side validation as a convenience that you provide your users. server-side validation is where you actually do the the validation
[04:35:04] <fire> hi. how can i add a class break on every 4th LI ?
[04:41:13] <anli_> fire: Do you create the li:s dynamically?
[04:41:22] <fire> yes
[04:41:41] <anli_> Then you can have a counter that goes from i and upwards, if i%4 ==0, then addClass
[04:41:42] <ravenzz> ?each @ fire
[04:41:43] <bot-t> fire, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[04:43:49] <fire> thank you
[04:44:54] <anli_> but you dont need to iterate the elements, you can add the class on creation time
[04:45:01] <anli_> Instead of looping them afterwards
[04:45:41] <fire> http://pastebin.com/c1t5HCQT
[04:47:22] <Wipp> Whats wrong with this: "if(($(table.items).length)==0)" - In firebug it shows that the length is indeed 0, but the condition never runs...
[04:51:30] <Wipp> So nothing wrong with my condition then? MUST BE A JQUERY BUG THEN.....................
[04:52:45] <cwillu> Wipp, you must not be getting to the if then
[04:53:20] <Wipp> cwillu I am getting to the if, firebug breaks on if condition
[04:54:12] <cwillu> and $(table.items).length evaluates to 0 in firebug at that point?
[04:55:24] <Wipp> cwillu yes!!!!
[04:55:59] <cwillu> then it must be a browser bug :p
[04:56:10] <Wipp> god damn
[04:56:11] <cwillu> as jquery is obviously evaluating correctly, as you've demonstrated :p
[04:56:20] <cwillu> (by which I mean:  you're doing something wrong somewhere)
[04:56:38] <cwillu> what is tables.items?  is it being modified elsewhere?
[04:56:43] <Wipp> yeah
[04:56:57] <cwillu> how so?
[04:57:20] <cwillu> (if you have a public link to the site in question, that would be useful)
[04:58:06] <Wipp> That site... well, no, you can't see it, top secret stuff...
[04:58:16] <cwillu> well, good luck with it then
[04:58:49] <Wipp> But I'm using Yii framework for it, running afterAjaxUpdate() function after user sends ajax post request to server, no fancy shit
[04:58:51] <Funhouse> is there a way to track how much memory a page is using?
[04:59:00] <Wipp> SHOULD work, but no, it doesn't
[04:59:47] <cwillu> Wipp, odds are whatever is setting table.items isn't actually running until a split-second after the condition, which is why it doesn't fire, but evaluates to the correct result in firebug
[05:00:14] <cwillu> but without seeing the page, it's basically impossible to get any more detailed than that
[05:01:03] <Wipp> Well, then, why don't I just use delay then and see if it works or not
[05:01:11] * cwillu sighs
[05:03:54] <cwillu> anyways, good luck with your super sekrit project :p
[05:07:35] <Wipp> cwillu its not super secret, it is just something that you wouldn't have access to, the server its running on does not have access from outside, plus it is a stock management - boring stuff
[05:07:43] <DEac-> hi
[05:08:27] <ravenzz> if ($('element').length) is what you need
[05:11:27] <_W_> when I get an error in an ajax request (from $.ajax()) how do I get the response entity? I see from the docs there's a jqXHR parameter, but no further explanation what this object is or what methods it have
[05:12:11] <skione> hey can you use append and slideDown together? what would the syntax be? $('#id').slideDown(append(var));?
[05:12:14] <_W_> oh I found it, at the top
[05:13:25] <DEac-> skione: $().slideDown().append()
[05:13:50] <DEac-> ups, better: $().append().slideDown()
[05:13:54] <skione> DEac- thanks
[05:16:12] <Wipp> ravenzz: setting breakpoints in firebug on this, it only break on the first "if" condition, and jumped over others: http://pastebin.com/SH7s3zGi
[05:17:29] <ravenzz> what i have to do with that simple snippet?
[05:17:59] <ravenzz> btw
[05:18:00] <Wipp> ravenzz: It never equates true nor false
[05:18:05] <ravenzz> $('table.items')
[05:18:15] <ravenzz> you are missing that quotes
[05:18:37] <Wipp> god damn f***...........
[05:18:53] <ravenzz> even though .items is a classname
[05:19:32] <Wipp> I know, items is supposed to be class name and table, well a table tag - ofcourse
[05:19:56] <Wipp> But the damn quoatation marks, such a stupid mistake I can't believe it
[05:20:29] <jeffsmykil> Man I'm spoiled, 27" screen is too small :/
[05:20:57] <bjornbjorn> does jquery have a native $(div).scrollTo() function? to scroll to a specific div?
[05:21:13] <Wipp> jeffsmykil: It is small... I have 3x24"  =)
[05:21:58] <ravenzz> ?scrolltop @ bjornbjorn
[05:21:59] <bot-t> bjornbjorn, .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[05:22:00] <RyanD> j #css
[05:22:02] <RyanD> bah
[05:22:59] <jeffsmykil> Wipp hopefully they are all the same brand, multiple monitors are tough for me
[05:23:01] <gg77> Hi. I am building a Single Page Interface application. I have a lot of experience in jquery, but when creating multiple page apps. I have done some research and found JMVC, backbone.js, spine.js, sammy.js which seem to be very sparse in rich examples and cmoplete featureset. Can someone guide me in 1) managing routes (bookmarks) 2) Lazy loading of models, views and controllers 3) managing the mapping and loading of resources
[05:23:01] <_ramo> hi
[05:23:02] <jeffsmykil> i hate the breaks
[05:23:08] <ndee> is there a function which randomizes the order of a string?
[05:23:32] <ndee> e.g.: if I have foobar, that it returns something like "baroof"
[05:23:44] <timing> ndee: I think you have to write it yourself
[05:23:50] <bjornbjorn> ravenzz: thanks!
[05:23:53] <ndee> timing, ok
[05:23:58] <_ramo> is it possible to give an event a name? i mean that i can log the textual representation of the event, e.g. viewing a video -> "view"
[05:24:14] <ravenzz> bjornbjorn also take a look at position()
[05:25:13] <bjornbjorn> ravenzz: k, $('#mydiv').scrollTop(0) gave me some weird results so checking out position()
[05:26:11] <hermanus> I got a variable with the name of the property that i need to read from an object. How do i read the property? If i do: object.variable_with_property_name it will look for the property variable_with_property_name instead of the value in it.
[05:26:16] <DEac-> i want to .load() every link somebody clicked, which are located on the same host. second all forms send to the same host and if it's possible everything, which will change the window.location should use .load(). i won't change all links, forms or anything else. i want to use something like .live()
[05:27:05] <gg77> can anybody guide me in building single page interfaces?
[05:27:19] <Wipp> jeffsmykil: Yeah, same brand, its a lg fullhd led monitor
[05:27:38] <DEac-> a second problem. i've some $(document).ready()-events, which will not be loaded on .load()
[05:28:05] <Wipp> jeffsmykil: Well, that is my work setup, in home I have 2x 19" monitors, one of which has failing capacitors which I cant be bothered to replace just yet
[05:30:39] <RyanD> Why would you "fix" a 19in monitor?
[05:31:29] <Wipp> So that I would still have 2 19" monitors?
[05:31:50] <ravenzz> bjornbjorn http://jsfiddle.net/UuryZ/
[05:31:51] <Wipp> replacing capacitors on that thing costs like 2usd, doesn't seem like much
[05:34:16] <bjornbjorn> ravenzz: cheers .. got it working with --> var off = $('#add-note-container').offset(); $(window).scrollTop(off.top);
[05:34:20] <wakawaka> hi all, anyone have any ideas why focus/blur won't work in ff 4.0.1?
[05:36:09] <bittyx-laptop> wakawaka: i'm doing some dev now, testing in ff4.0.1, and i have a .focus() event that works as expected. you should probably define "won't work" a bit better.
[05:37:05] <wilrod^> hey, is there any way i can set character encoding with jquery?
[05:37:35] <wakawaka> bittyx-laptop: right - just glad to hear someone has it working! thought i was losing my mind, i have blur event attached to an input, and id like it to preventDefault and maintain focus if the input val is empty
[05:38:03] <wakawaka> however it seems that event.preventDefault() won't maintain focus, nor return false
[05:38:50] <wakawaka> neither will $('.theinput').blur(function() { $(this).focus(); or event.target.focus() or event.currentTarget.focus()...
[05:39:19] <gg77> anyone?
[05:39:43] <RyanD> Wipp:  Ah. Was unaware they were that inexpensive. I'm too lazy for that.
[05:39:47] <RyanD> Well, lazy in that sense.
[05:39:54] <wakawaka> bittyx-laptop: what os are you on? perhaps ff4.0.1 on linux has an issue
[05:40:16] <bittyx-laptop> wakawaka: i test in ff4.0.0 on win7, and ff4.0.1 on ubuntu 10.10, and it works on both
[05:40:23] <bittyx-laptop> wakawaka: have you got an online link perhaps?
[05:41:16] <wakawaka> no not at the moment, but good idea, i'll try it out in jsfiddle
[05:46:58] <sunscreen> can you make a wekkit mobile device zoom out
[05:48:00] <wakawaka> bittyx-laptop: http://jsfiddle.net/qpkvR/ no luck in fiddle either
[05:48:56] <wakawaka> perhaps there's another event in the chain somewhere, in which it removes focus after i've added focus on blur
[05:53:03] <clorith> I'm pondering how to add a jQueryUI dialog with norwegina characters. I'd normally do &oslash; to make na √∏ for example, but for some reason these don't get evaluated in the dialog buttons
[05:54:51] <wakawaka> bittyx-laptop: http://api.jquery.com/focus/#dsq-comment-body-56821668 suggests a using a timeout, seems a bit hacky though
[05:55:11] <bittyx-laptop> wakawaka: sorry for the misunderstanding, i've been using .focusin() and .focusout(), not .focus() specifically. but here's a workaround that may work for you: http://jsfiddle.net/pBft9/
[05:55:16] <bittyx-laptop> wakawaka: yeah, that's what i did here
[05:55:49] <bittyx-laptop> wakawaka: it is hacky, but whatever. it probably has to do with the order that firefox fires the events in
[05:56:18] <bittyx-laptop> wakawaka: e.g. it will fire the function defined for .blur() in between the first element losing focus, and the next element getting focus
[05:57:13] <bittyx-laptop> wakawaka: so the first element loses focus (by, say, pressing tab), which fires the .blur() function - which returns the focus to the first element. after that, firefox gives focus to the second element (since TAB was pressed earlier)
[05:57:28] <clorith> http://jsfiddle.net/AGfZX/ <-- as yo ucan see here, it's clearly leeving the markup untouched
[05:58:07] <wakawaka> bittyx-laptop: sounds good, thanks very much!
[06:01:36] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: .dialog probably does htmlentities() on the button text, so if you just type the actual ¯ in the button name, the markup will likely have the correct entity
[06:02:21] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: hmm, or maybe not
[06:02:26] <clorith> bittyx-laptop: already tried that, it gets the default square box wit ha "?" in it because it cna't find it =/
[06:02:52] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: is your page encoding set as utf-8?
[06:03:15] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: because when i put the actual ¯ in the button text instead of the entity, i see it correctly on the button
[06:03:15] <clorith> yeah
[06:03:29] <bittyx-laptop> http://jsfiddle.net/AGfZX/1
[06:03:31] <clorith> it's encoded in utf-8 with the nb-NO locale
[06:03:48] <clorith> yeah, on jsfiddle it does, I dunno why it done'st on my page
[06:04:01] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: in that link, i can see the correct symbol both on windows and ubuntu
[06:04:21] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: have you got a link for testing?
[06:04:26] <bittyx-laptop> i mean, one you could share?
[06:04:48] <clorith> hmm, I don't think I do unfortunately
[06:05:35] <clorith> nope, none that I can share unfortunately
[06:05:49] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: if you put ¯ in the html source (not the jquery dialog, but the text in the div), does it show up correctly in the browser?
[06:06:06] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: you can PM me if you don't want to share it publicly
[06:06:21] <clorith> it done'st display properly then either
[06:06:36] <clorith> And I cna't share the link because it's on the inside of a private system, nda and all that :P
[06:06:46] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: then you've got a problem with encodings. how do you set your encoding? through the meta tag?
[06:06:53] <clorith> yeah, through meta
[06:07:09] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: and does the server also send the encoding in the headers?
[06:07:28] <clorith> I basically do doctype to xhtml 1.0 transitional, set the html tag with the lang= attribute and the nI do the utf-8 charset as a meta tag
[06:07:47] <clorith> my server is set ot default to utf-8 unless you manualyl tell it to do otherwise (in say php)
[06:08:14] <bittyx-laptop> yes, but does your browser actually receive the utf-8 encoding in a header?
[06:08:30] <clorith> oh, yes my browser reads it as utf-8
[06:09:25] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: well the only option then is that you're not correctly saving your files as utf-8.
[06:09:28] <wilrod^> I get a warning when I try to load RSS feed with ajax. Any good workaround?
[06:10:56] <clorith> I guess I'll play around with it some more, but it's still odd that it won't accept the &; parts in button texts etc as it should interpret html I'd think?
[06:13:21] <bittyx-laptop> clorith: the .dialog() function is automatically turning & into &amp; so the resulting markup is actually &amp;oacute; which shows up as &oacute; in the browser (instead of the corresponding character)
[06:13:36] <clorith> bittyx-laptop: Well, that explains it then
[06:13:43] <clorith> Now I just need to find a sneaky way around it xD
[06:15:19] <wilrod^> can I get rss through json?
[06:15:34] <wilrod^> as that would return xml
[06:16:13] <ravenzz> through jsonp
[06:16:15] <clorith> wilrod^: Yes, but if it's rss from a different site you need ot do the whole json hax
[06:16:42] <ravenzz> you can use the google feed api
[06:17:32] <Eclesia> hi
[06:17:40] <shichuan> hi
[06:17:52] <Eclesia> I would like to make a splitpane, is that possible ?
[06:18:05] <Eclesia> (with jquery 1.4.2)
[06:20:14] <skramy> im doing $("#adiv").find(a).eq(0).html() but it gives me the contents of the a-tag
[06:20:25] <skramy> this is such a newb question, but how do i get the whole a eleemnt and contnets of it?
[06:20:34] <skramy> i tried using parent() but that gives me too much
[06:21:33] <daxim_> skramy, .get()
[06:21:48] <skramy> magic!
[06:21:56] <skramy> i have never had to use that.. weird
[06:22:05] <skramy> been using jquery on and off for a for a few months
[06:22:09] <roger_padactor> using plupload inside a UI Dialog, for some reasons once opened the Add Files buttons doesn't work.  I am generating the dialog with code once an upload button is pressed.  I've tried doing a refresh once the dialog has been opened but that didn't seem to do anything.
[06:22:09] <roger_padactor> \
[06:22:32] <wilrod^> you guys see something wrong in this simple ajax request? http://pastebin.com/GquEh87G
[06:23:29] <daxim_> data is undefined?
[06:23:38] <amereservant_> Is there a function like substr() that will work on an integer?  for example, var numbr = 2011; var newnum = numbr.substr(2, 2);
[06:23:46] <wilrod^> daxim_, yeah
[06:23:55] <wilrod^> why so?
[06:25:43] <daxim_> amereservant_, numbr = numbr + '';  // coerce to string
[06:26:01] <daxim_> wilrod^, you are the programmer, *you* are supposed to know why
[06:26:10] <amereservant_> daxim_, Gotcha, thanks!
[06:27:05] <wilrod^> daxim_, no it was a copy/paste... noticed the variable data now... lol
[06:27:37] <carl-johan-l> could someone enlighten me a bit on event bubbling (at least I think that's what's bugging me). I'm working on a layout including flipboxes (http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2010/03/sponsor-wall-flip-jquery-css/demo.php) and just like in the demo, the "backside" of the boxes has links in them. now I would like the whole box to be clickable (flip effect) but if I click a child a:link element the box flip should not fire. any good ideas on h
[06:27:37] <carl-johan-l> do that?
[06:27:39] <skramy> daxim_: how do i go from .get() to a string I can embed as HTML?
[06:28:00] <AdvoWork> if i have loads of table rows, all uniqued by id, ie "table_row_reference_1, table_row_reference_2, table_row_reference_3 etc, how can i cycle the table for all of thoese, so  i know how many ive got like that?
[06:28:46] <daxim_> skramy, it's the 0th element in the returned array
[06:29:03] <skramy> so just add  [0] ? is that good form
[06:29:04] <skramy> ?
[06:29:21] <daxim_> I don't know.  let's have a look at the documentation.
[06:29:28] <carl-johan-l> AdvoWork: use .length for either the specific ID you are counting or for the tr element in the table? is that what you meant to do?
[06:30:04] <daxim_> http://api.jquery.com/get  # yup, it's documented that way.  index access is part of the official api
[06:30:33] <skramy> ok
[06:33:05] <AdvoWork> carl-johan-l, well, i would first need to find out how many new rows have been added(all of these will have an id "table_row_reference_"X where X is an increment from 1.  one i know theres say 20, i will cycle through them.. any suggestions?
[06:33:19] <wilrod^> daxim_, you know if a can get a rss feed (in xml that is) without getting the warning "The page is accessing information.."
[06:36:08] <carl-johan-l> AdvoWork: hmm, just so I get you right, you want to count the number of added rows, and if there is a certain amount then do a loop through them all?
[06:40:16] <roger_padactor> ahh now the add files button works anywhere i click in the dialog box.
[06:40:30] <AdvoWork> carl-johan-l, thats correct, every time the user presses Add, it adds a new row but it increments by 1 each time, if that makes sense, could i just count all rows where the id contains "whatever" ?
[06:41:23] <carl-johan-l> wait, so your issue is how to get the number which will be in the ID for the row?
[06:41:51] <Aokaado> quick question, can't seem to find it by search, but how do i select <a href=''> links etc to animate the text, but not any links that consist of images only?
[06:43:00] <fmerges> Aokaado: <a><img></a> ? or <a href=".ext"> ?
[06:43:38] <carl-johan-l> AdvoWork: wait, so your issue is how to get the number which will be in the ID for the member:row?
[06:43:39] <Aokaado> selct <a href='blabla'>yay</a>, but not <a href='blabla'><img src='blabla'></a>
[06:45:07] <Trisox> any one idea's ? http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/hfPVj/6/ try to remove "meer..." if  there are less then 3 items
[06:45:07] <fmerges> Aokaado: $('a > img').not() ?
[06:50:08] <jonclark> Aokaado: $("a:not(:has(img))")
[06:50:57] <Aokaado> ah thanks, that one works
[06:56:36] <jeffsmykil> How would I go about making a number of elements based on a variable number
[06:56:46] <jeffsmykil> say like x number of divs
[06:57:35] <AdvoWork> carl-johan-l, basically new rows are added to a table, all will have an id "new_row" i need to count all rows that have "new_row" as an id, so i get a number, that i can then use to cycle through..
[06:57:42] <ohcibi> when using jQuery.each() is there a way to fire a callback after every object is iterated over?
[06:58:43] <wilrod^> theres a sample here using deffereds with ajax, the ajax call is assigned to a variable named req, but how do i trigger the call when it¬¥s inside a variabel?
[06:58:47] <wilrod^> http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[06:59:43] <fmerges> Aokaado: $('a').not(':has(img)') same...
[07:02:01] <kojiro> slightly OT: Is it not possible to edit the <base> element of a page via firebug?
[07:09:31] <wilrod^> Is there any way to get RSS with ajax without that "The page is accessing information..." warning showing up?
[07:11:16] <carl-johan-l> AdvoWork: then you should use .length to count the existing elements some how, and then add +1 to that number to generate the correct ID.
[07:11:33] <carl-johan-l> AdvoWork: http://api.jquery.com/length/
[07:19:34] <serio> wilrod^: you'd need to create a proxy of somesort with a server-side language
[07:20:11] <serio> typically the process goes, read remote rss file on the the local server, then load that resource into your application
[07:20:14] <gg77> hey every1. can anyone help me manage my routes across a single page application I am building using a RESTful backend
[07:25:57] <ryther> hi, is anyone here familiar with spynner for python, or could help me with jquery selector statements?
[07:28:32] <AdvoWork> if ive got: <tr id="new_sort_row_1" class="new_sort_row"><td id="new_customers_reference_1"><span class="dblclick_new_sort">test</span></td></tr>   how would I go about getting the word "test" out of that, as its a span, within a td, within a tr, within a table?
[07:29:42] <phlp> $('#new_customers_reference_1').text()
[07:38:55] <iamjarvo> is it possible to have a button that reveals all the accordion items for jquery ui
[07:44:04] <csmrfx> I have this crazy eye-candy generator: http://koti.kapsi.fi/csmr/textomorpher.html . I want to export styles from class to each elements style attribute. Ideas?
[07:44:34] <csmrfx> (so that ppl can copy those to anywhere and use the generated gfx on their pages without css or js)
[07:45:52] <anli_> Is there a jquery function for checking if a variable is defined?
[07:46:07] <ohcibi> whats the newsest way to jiggle a div
[07:46:08] <ohcibi> ?
[07:48:52] <csmrfx> anli_: javascript provides that
[07:49:29] <anli_> yeah, its only that  I cannot wrap it in a function
[07:49:49] <progrock> Ok, heres a random one, I'm using uglifyjs, when it minifies, it has the heading comments, but there's no newline from the end of the comments to the first line of code (in other words all the code is on the same line as the alst lien of the ocmments).. anyone know how to force a newline there (I know it doesnt matter, but I'm picky)
[07:49:50] <anli_> I cannot create a function called is_defined and then run is_defined(bajskorv)
[07:51:08] <csmrfx> progrock yes. open in editor. hit enter. save file.
[07:51:56] <csmrfx> anli_: learn javascript. you test for defined objects in javascript with (typeof(myObj)=="undefined").
[07:53:06] <csmrfx> anli_: iow, your solution would be function is_defined?(_obj) { return (!typeof(_obj)=="undefined"); } or something like that
[07:54:05] <anli_> So if I put a question mark there, js dont bother if _obj is not defined?
[07:55:09] <anli_> Seems like the scripting engine doesnt even come to the function call, it only sees that the paremeter is unknown
[07:58:36] <ccmonster> anyone have any experience or knowledge about the jquery ui menu?
[08:04:42] <csmrfx> anli_: detaild may vary, but the idea holds
[08:15:24] <anli_> csmrfx: I do not get the impression that you listened to my last question :)
[08:15:55] <anli_> I just cannot run is_defined(somethingthatsnotdefined);
[08:16:04] <anli_> js will not let the function call execute
[08:16:11] <anli_> Right?
[08:16:45] <AdvoWork> how come if ive got a checkbox, and i do: $('#new_chosen').val() it shows "on"  if its checked or not?
[08:20:16] <_ramo> hi
[08:20:49] <pwsdotru> AdvoWork: try $('#new_chosen').attr('checked')
[08:20:56] <Kaapa>  
[08:21:18] <_ramo> if i have two applications: server/a and server/b , and application a implmenets an iframe, that loads pages from application b, is it than possible to send data per jquery from application b to the iframe (parent?) ?
[08:21:29] <_ramo> is this understandable?
[08:22:32] <ch3mical> AdvoWork: for checkboxes I suggest you move up to jq 1.6 and use the .prop function, attr is iffy at best for checkboxes and radios
[08:22:43] <ch3mical> AdvoWork: if you're already on 1.6, good, use .prop
[08:23:19] <ch3mical> .attr can give a lot of false positives or false negatives with things like "checked" or "selected" attributes
[08:24:56] <seutje> bot-t: tell matjas U NO Y
[08:24:57] <bot-t> seutje, Okay.
[08:25:08] <naomi> how can i add a click bind to an element only if there's no other click listener bound?
[08:25:10] <ajpiano> seutje: he does??
[08:25:31] <DEac-> how i can get all binded events to an object?
[08:25:33] <ajpiano> i don't :(
[08:29:03] <naomi> hmm i've never actually had this problem before
[08:29:12] <naomi> this seems like it's a common thing, too
[08:50:12] <_ramo> is there an event, that listens if something in an iframe changes?
[08:51:00] <mattp_> hey, do you guys have any suggestions for a cool roll over effect?
[08:51:19] <mattp_> ie a forkme tab button in the corner of a screen, but when clicked it overlays a floating modal window thingy
[08:51:44] <ravenzz> ?live
[08:51:45] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[08:51:51] <ravenzz> sorry
[08:52:25] <ravenzz> mattp_ could you provide a live example?
[08:53:43] <mattp_> ravenzz: not really sure. im looking to add a 'need some help? contact' button. when you click that button i just want a fill out form to roll over the screen that they can type an issue into
[08:53:54] <mattp_> without leaving the page etc
[08:54:22] <mattp_> im open to suggestion on how to go about it :)
[08:56:13] <ravenzz> then you can google a bit
[08:57:01] <ravenzz> http://www.redfoxmagazine.com/30-awesome-jquery-contact-form/
[08:57:51] <mattp_> ravenzz: cool, looking into it :) thanks
[08:59:38] <lduros> hello, there are a few jquery plugins for fixed table header (stays at the top when scrolling page) -- I wondered if anyone has a preference or is there one authoritative plugin? Thanks!
[09:00:38] <brianearwood> Hi everyone, I'm having a problem where a fadeOut opacity change in jQuery makes the element being faded jump to the back of the z-index stack or something. A few other elements on the page, like a flash video and my search box jump in front of the faded element before it fades out.  Anyone know what might be happening here?
[09:02:43] <ravenzz> brianearwood we need some code
[09:02:46] <devil2005> im trying to animate border radius, how could i do that? http://pastie.org/1981355 is what i have tried so far
[09:02:52] <ravenzz> ?p @ brianearwood
[09:02:52] <bot-t> brianearwood, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[09:07:03] <brianearwood> Here is my code that controls the fading element: http://jsfiddle.net/brianearwood/YyrTL/
[09:09:24] <ravenzz> brianearwood it doesn't work
[09:09:32] <ravenzz> at all
[09:09:50] <brianearwood> click the gray background area
[09:10:09] <gf3> NO U
[09:10:42] <ravenzz> this is almost the worst overlay i ever seen
[09:10:50] <brianearwood> why is that?
[09:11:21] <brianearwood> the styling isn't right in jsfiddle
[09:11:45] <ravenzz> anyway what's the matter?
[09:11:51] <gf3> also it doesn't close!
[09:11:56] <gf3> RAGE MODAL
[09:12:11] <gf3> oh it does
[09:12:14] <brianearwood> I just copied the jQuery to make it close when you click the background
[09:12:18] <gf3> it just takes two lifetimes
[09:12:39] <ravenzz> ok ... so?
[09:13:07] <brianearwood> sorry, maybe I should have copied more code.  Yeah it closes really slow so I could see if it jumps behind other elements before or after the fade... there's some context that you aren't seeing in the fiddle
[09:13:46] <brianearwood> so my problem is that this element jumps behind other positioned elements on my page right at the start of the fadeOut
[09:14:04] <Ari-Ugwu> booo
[09:14:40] <ravenzz> brianearwood which kind of elements?
[09:14:48] <Ari-Ugwu> Create a test case only with the style and elements in question? Or replicate the whole thing a test server where someone can see what's going on?
[09:15:07] <Ari-Ugwu> Or let people probe your questions until a reasonable description is attained.
[09:15:15] * Ari-Ugwu rings the bell for option 3.
[09:16:03] <brianearwood> one is a flash video embed from youTube
[09:16:27] <brianearwood> some other elements are relative positioned
[09:17:46] <brianearwood> yeah, I should have a location to test this.
[09:18:18] <Ari-Ugwu> wmode is the common fix for flash elements (I think).
[09:18:46] <brianearwood> ravenzz, are you saying this is the worst you've seen because of how it looks?
[09:25:44] <ravenzz> brianearwood http://jsfiddle.net/fZmtH/
[09:26:11] <longlifemilk> $('.replace').click(function(e){}    . does this create a clone? the $('.replace') portion
[09:27:13] <brianearwood> thanks ravenzz, I see that my problem is that the modal overlay container isn't positioned as absolute so it's falling behind the other absolute elements on my page.
[09:27:45] <ravenzz> then it's an z-index issue
[09:28:27] <longlifemilk> or is it searching for the "replace" object?
[09:28:45] <brianearwood> yeah, it was just hard to illustrate without having a development site online for testing. Thanks for the help.
[09:29:03] <ravenzz> longlifemilk you are selecting the .replace element and binding an event on it
[09:30:42] <ravenzz> brianearwood np.. hope you'll enjoy the video
[09:30:44] <ravenzz> :f
[09:31:28] <ale_> can I do $('id').action1.action2(function..... ? or something like that?
[09:32:27] <ravenzz> depends on which action .. anyway yes
[09:32:50] <brianearwood> hahaha! That lady was just doing what came natural.
[09:32:56] <jMyles> I am having a most frustrating experience:  I am trying to bind .datepicker() to an input that is cloned.  I have read the various SO questions about using .delegate() and .datepicker(), but none of the courses of action seem to work.
[09:33:07] <ravenzz> rotfl
[09:34:19] <ale_> ravenzz: how?
[09:34:41] <snover> jMyles: delegation is for events. datepicker is not an event.
[09:34:42] <bot-t> (9 hours 6 mins 40 secs ago) <gnarf> tell snover It's my birthday today -- are we going to the mall?? ;)
[09:35:14] <ravenzz> ale_ $('#foo').css('font-size','10px').fadeOut(200).fadeIn(3000);
[09:35:16] <ravenzz> etc
[09:35:17] <ale_> ravenzz: because my problem  is that I have a form, but it is not being sent when I press the Enter, instead I should click on Send Form (i.e)
[09:35:55] <ravenzz> can i see your code?
[09:37:04] <longlifemilk> what happens when you send the word this to $()?
[09:37:54] <ravenzz> longlifemilk you should read http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
[09:37:56] <ale_> ravenzz: http://pastebin.com/4nqdzv2C
[09:38:37] <ravenzz> ale_ next time use jsfiddle.net
[09:38:50] <ale_> ravenzz: sorry, can you still check it?
[09:38:54] <ravenzz> yes
[09:39:04] <ravenzz> anyway i can't see any <form>
[09:39:26] <jMyles> snover: Right - I had been delegating .focus() or .hover() or .click() to bind .datepicker().  That, however, is not working for me.  How would you cause a dynamically generated (in fact .clone() created) element to be bound to .datepicker()?
[09:39:50] <snover> $foo.clone().datepicker()
[09:40:00] <ale_> ravenzz: no, I didn't create one
[09:40:11] <ravenzz> you should do that.
[09:40:28] <ravenzz> that's not valid
[09:41:14] <ravenzz> so..fix your markup before
[09:41:25] <ravenzz> then you should take a look at
[09:41:32] <ravenzz> ?submit
[09:41:32] <bot-t> .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[09:42:53] <ale_> ravenzz: how it won't work in that way, I'd should change the whole code!
[09:42:57] <Matias> Hello
[09:44:04] <ale_> ravenzz: I mean, I don't won't the form to reload the page, how can I do that? maybe by adding the action="#"?
[09:44:18] <ravenzz> no
[09:44:19] <ale_> ravenzz: or e.preventDefault() ?
[09:44:20] <Matias> what is the default timeout for ajax request? in case it's not "infinite", should I set -1 or 0?
[09:44:25] <ravenzz> yes
[09:44:38] <ravenzz> read the submit() doc
[09:45:02] <lduros> does anyone know of a jquery plugin for fixed table header that wouldn't have any scrollbars around the table, but use the main window scrollbars instead? http://jcbulanadi.oni.cc/scrollablefixedheader.html
[09:45:02] <Matias> ale_, I would return false from the submit callback
[09:45:20] <lduros> I'd like to have the same functionality, but the table doesn't have scrollbars ...
[09:45:24] <ale_> ravenzz: working :D thanks!
[09:45:25] <ravenzz> ale_ don't.
[09:45:33] <ravenzz> np
[09:45:52] <ravenzz> anyway you really should rewrite your html
[09:45:53] <Matias> isn't it a better idea to return 0?
[09:46:42] <ravenzz> gotta go
[09:47:43] <JonathanCutrell_> So, I know this is a big faux pas...
[09:47:49] <JonathanCutrell_> But I'm gonna do it anyway.
[09:48:14] <JonathanCutrell_> I am looking for a lightbox (there it is...) that can be triggered on a jquery object containing images.
[09:48:16] <JonathanCutrell_> http://pastie.org/1981537
[09:49:20] <JonathanCutrell_> I could code this myself, but I figured that out of all of you smart folks, there's probably someone who has needed something similar before.
[09:50:20] <lduros> this is probably my fix: http://www.afekenholm.se/jquery-thead-assistant
[09:52:44] <g0rd0n> i have a question about jqueryui tabs. i have a table inside a tab, and when i click on a row i create a new tab with contents in it (loaded via ajax). only problem is, that new tab is not opened, i still have to click on it to see the content. is there any way to automatically enable a tab when creating it?
[09:54:27] <jrockjiggz> g0rd0n: try $( ".selector" ).tabs( "option", "selected", 3 );
[09:54:41] <jrockjiggz> var selected = $( ".selector" ).tabs( "option", "selected" );
[09:54:59] <g0rd0n> yeah but how do i know which index the new tab has got?
[09:55:56] <fostah> Hey can anyone help me, I am trying to make a javascript bookmark, that when clicked, it will append an iframe to a page.
[09:56:32] <jrockjiggz> g0rd0n: try counting $('.tabs').length++
[09:56:53] <g0rd0n> jrockjiggz: ok thanks, i will do so
[09:58:45] <_ramo> how is this construct called: $('#myId', top.doducment) ?
[10:07:25] <longlifemilk> $('.replace').click(function(e){}           e was not declared. is it apart of the jquery api?
[10:07:40] <KWhat_Work> is .widget going away?
[10:09:34] <JethroLarson> Is there anyone here familiar with Jorn's Validator plugin?
[10:10:12] <Caraes_Naur> that's a very popular plugin
[10:11:55] <JonathanCutrell_> JethroLarson: I'm not familiar with it, but what's your question?
[10:14:41] <JethroLarson> http://jsfiddle.net/jethrolarson/AGxRr/2/
[10:14:41] <JethroLarson> It seems to only validate the first instance of any fields sharing name. Further, if I hack that away it still only generates one error message for each set that share the name.
[10:16:57] <JethroLarson> I'm using multiple <select> elements and :number to create two lists in the form post. Works fine from an http perspective, but validation seems to be making some assumptions which don't match my usage.
[10:17:08] <JonathanCutrell_> JethroLarson: I'm pretty sure you can't have inputs that share names
[10:17:18] <JethroLarson> And you'd be wrong
[10:17:23] <JethroLarson> ;)
[10:17:36] <JethroLarson> that's how you do radio groups
[10:18:00] <g0rd0n> jrockjiggz: that count thing on the tabs doesnt work
[10:18:10] <g0rd0n> just returns 1
[10:18:13] <naomi> when a user clicks "favorite" for an image in my gallery, i'd like to animate and scaledown the image as if the user click-dragged it to their username in the top right of the screen. is this possible?
[10:18:49] <JonathanCutrell_> JethroLarson: right on. Sorry - little cloudy. haha
[10:19:31] <JonathanCutrell_> JethroLarson: perhaps the jQuery selector isn't returning but the first matched element.
[10:19:40] <JonathanCutrell_> JethroLarson: (in the plugin, I mean)
[10:19:55] <JonathanCutrell_> JethroLarson: although that is unlikely if that plugin is popular.
[10:20:43] <devil2005> is there a more efficient way of this code? http://pastie.org/1981655 it is a hover event and when it mouses off the colors get reset back to the way they were, but i feel like isnt there a toggle command for it?
[10:21:06] <JethroLarson> JonathanCutrell_: Yeah, he's specifically filtering everything but the first element.
[10:21:16] <phlp> radio buttons can have the same name because only one can be selected and submitted
[10:21:47] <g0rd0n> oops my bad
[10:21:50] <JethroLarson> You can make checkbox groups too
[10:21:50] <JethroLarson> and the post just creates a param for each one that's checked
[10:22:58] <JonathanCutrell_> JethroLarson: perhaps you should try adding a class and then using that as your validation selector.
[10:23:08] <JethroLarson> I do
[10:23:20] <phlp> so even if it does send two quantity params how will you tell them apart
[10:23:32] <felo> help I was helped yesterday
[10:23:37] <JethroLarson> Most backend languages solve that
[10:23:49] <felo> but I lost the line where they have helped with two forms
[10:23:55] <felo> a comment an a response form
[10:24:25] <JethroLarson> coldfusion turns
[10:24:25] <JethroLarson> ?x=1&x=2
[10:24:25] <JethroLarson> into x=(1,2)
[10:24:29] <bot-t> JethroLarson, Jquery .attr converts & to &amp; in my links ! - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5145708/jquery-attr-converts-to-amp-in-my-links
[10:24:32] <felo> I want the <a>comment</a> that slidetoggle knows what parent comment does he belowns
[10:24:33] <felo> to
[10:24:45] <JonathanCutrell_> JethroLarson: usually it submits as an array; so you might would name it name[0] and name[1]
[10:25:10] <JethroLarson> I'm not using jquery ajax
[10:25:12] <SkyFlyer> is there a way to or an event that will query a text box and see whats inside it while the person is typeing.  I want to dynamically display what the person types into a div.  on the left.  So as they type, the div fills up too? best way to do this?
[10:25:25] <phlp> yes but can you rely on the order of the params being the same as in the html
[10:26:47] <felo> how can I record the comment parent id to let the response <a>comment</a> slidingToggle to present the response form to know to what parent comment form does it belongs to, so I can display each response below to its comment parent.
[10:27:36] <felo> Someone has told me that i should create a data property inside <a> tag so the comment text below the parent comment knows to what comment does it belongs too
[10:29:10] <d4rklit3> hi
[10:29:20] <d4rklit3> so today is my first day actually trying to use jquery
[10:29:30] <felo> is fun
[10:29:49] <d4rklit3> so i looking to use .post() and get some json data
[10:29:51] <felo> d4rklit3 I am new too want to be my peer during this journy
[10:29:52] <SkyFlyer> i'm guessing i could use a key down listener, but I only want to listen if the onfocus is on that text box. would something like that work?
[10:29:58] <d4rklit3> hah sure
[10:30:13] <d4rklit3> im mostly intersted in AJAX
[10:30:26] <felo> ok
[10:31:50] <d4rklit3> is there something like this   $('.result').html(data);  but instead of .html you do .json(data)
[10:32:27] <JethroLarson> there's no built-in template for converting json to html
[10:32:49] <JethroLarson> jquery-tmpl plugin can help with that though
[10:35:54] <lduros> how can I determine if an element is off the visible current window? Let's say if someone scrolls down, and that element is not visible anymore in the window?
[10:36:10] <lduros> .offset()?
[10:36:48] <felo> please I have this jfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/xysxD/11/
[10:37:07] <felo> the comment text is slideToggling
[10:37:27] <felo> i want to record the id of each parent comment when clicked on comment to slideToggle
[10:37:39] <felo> comment text is within <a> tags
[10:38:59] <JethroLarson> d4rklit3: You can do stuff like this
[10:38:59] <JethroLarson> $.post('ajax/test.json', function(data) {
[10:38:59] <JethroLarson>   $('#name').html(data.name);
[10:38:59] <JethroLarson>   $('#state').html(data.state);
[10:38:59] <JethroLarson> },'json');
[10:39:38] <felo> jethrolarson what is that for?
[10:39:42] <d4rklit3> JethroLarson:  what about $.ajax({ ])
[10:39:44] <d4rklit3> what is that
[10:39:54] <JethroLarson> that's the long form
[10:39:58] <d4rklit3> aah i see
[10:40:04] <JethroLarson> $.post is just shorthand
[10:40:10] <d4rklit3> where do i put the post vars?
[10:40:24] <JethroLarson> I tend to use $.ajax honestly because it's explicit
[10:40:40] <d4rklit3> yeah i have no idea of best practices w/ js
[10:40:51] <d4rklit3> but im looking at the docs for post
[10:41:18] <JethroLarson> Might as well start with $.ajax so you learn all of the available options
[10:41:24] <steffen> hey everyone
[10:41:24] <d4rklit3> heheh
[10:41:27] <d4rklit3> yeah
[10:41:28] <JethroLarson> post params are "data"
[10:41:37] <d4rklit3> aah
[10:41:56] <d4rklit3> ok
[10:41:59] <d4rklit3> shorthand is fine
[10:42:00] <d4rklit3> :)
[10:42:18] <steffen> I've got a problem with jcarousellite.  since I change my slider-content via ajax it behaves  in a funny way.
[10:42:41] <steffen> guess it has got to do with the amount of slides, which changes by each request
[10:43:05] <steffen> anyone ever had a similar issue?
[10:43:08] <muay-guy> excuse me: is document.getElementById('planillaCliente').getElementsByTagName('tr'); in javascript the same as $("#planillaCliente, tr"); in jquery?
[10:43:20] <d4rklit3> im going to apologize in advance for all the potentially stupid questions i may ask :)
[10:43:33] <muay-guy> maybe I should have started off with that too
[10:43:53] <JethroLarson> d4rklit3: Shorthand is more doable since deferreds were added to the ajax methods. So if you need to add success/error callbacks you can just chain them on
[10:44:54] <JethroLarson> Though I guess that counts as advanced usage, sorry :)
[10:45:10] <steffen> has anyone used jcarousel with wordpress?
[10:45:43] <csmrfx> steffen anyone with ajax problems caused by not grokking ajax? lot of ppl
[10:45:45] <d4rklit3> ive used AS2 a lot back in my day
[10:45:51] <d4rklit3> im used to the notation (though im not a big fan)
[10:46:47] <steffen> hm well. that doesnt help ;)
[10:47:34] <systemfault> muay-guy: No
[10:48:03] <systemfault> muay-guy: Take out the comma and yes.
[10:48:15] <muay-guy> systemfault: how would you do it instead?
[10:48:21] <JethroLarson> You can do $('#planillaCliente tr') or $('#planillaCliente').find('tr')
[10:48:32] <systemfault> muay-guy: ^
[10:48:33] <felo> Jethrolarson
[10:48:34] <ch3mical> Hopefully my connection is stable now

[10:48:54] <muay-guy> systemfault: thanks
[10:49:30] <systemfault> muay-guy Learn CSS, it's worth it
[10:50:10] <muay-guy> systemfault: I know css it's my javascript the one that sucks
[10:50:46] <systemfault> muay-guy: The string that you put inside $("") it's a CSS selector.
[10:51:43] <muay-guy> yes, that much I do know. I have a whole js file to "translate" to jquery...it shouldn't be that hard but I have to figure some things out. Do you have a quick reference for me to check?
[10:52:27] <systemfault> It's CSS, really :/ Take 2-3 minutes and read the selector parts of CSS2/3
[10:52:56] <muay-guy> ok cool, then I shouldn't have that many issues. THanks
[10:52:57] <systemfault> jQuery has some extensions but you can select everything with standard CSS
[10:55:43] <Snerf> I am trying with json, I have an array: $value = array("id"=>"$row[id]", "value"=>"$row[value]"); print json_encode($value);  ... my routine returns a multiple of those, but in my $.ajax query, I get an error on JSON.parse, how can I properly return an array of these $value's
[10:55:52] <JethroLarson> felo: responded
[10:56:30] <d4rklit3> soo is it normal to just write HTML w/ .html()
[10:56:45] <muay-guy> if I wanna get some fields value its like js? eg: filterNum($("price").value); ?
[10:56:46] <felo> where?>
[10:56:54] <felo> in the fiddle?
[10:57:02] <JethroLarson> so
[10:57:11] <d4rklit3> say i have <div id='foo'>    i can do   $.("foo").html(<div id="bar" />);
[10:57:18] <d4rklit3> and it will add bar to foo
[10:57:26] <felo> Jethrolarson you did in the fiddle ?
[10:57:38] <felo> that what is does
[10:57:43] <systemfault> d4rklit3: Not sure it will work with a . between the $ and ("foo")
[10:57:44] <JethroLarson> felo: stackoverflow
[10:57:48] <felo> ok
[10:57:57] <d4rklit3> o sorry
[10:58:08] <ajpiano> d4rklit3, it is normal, but you have to wrap the html in a string literal
[10:58:45] <d4rklit3> ajpiano: example?
[10:59:02] <JethroLarson> $.("foo").html('<div id="bar" />');
[10:59:06] <ajpiano> $("#foo").html("<div id='bar'>Hi</div>");
[10:59:08] <d4rklit3> oo
[10:59:09] <d4rklit3> in quote
[10:59:10] <d4rklit3> s
[11:01:54] <felo> Jethro it will be trigger after sliding ? because the variable is dead before sliding toggle. if you know what I mean by dead. I gues it is after sliding the toggle right. If so that means I will have to send the id $(this).nextAll(".commentForm:first").slideToggle(); some where in this line
[11:04:52] <Whirl3d> Hello all. Is there a better way to use jquery to call a function on a selection than $("selecteditem").each(functiontoapply)   I'd like to keep it in the chain if possible....something like $("selected").call(function) or ??
[11:05:47] <matschaffer> Whirl3d: like .map?
[11:06:24] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: make it into a jquery plugin, which will still do .each internally.
[11:07:07] <Whirl3d> matschaffer, not exactly, though I must admit that I am not that great at .mapping things...
[11:08:00] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, i'll try it. Shouldn't be too hard to do should it?
[11:08:16] <r3x> hello everyone
[11:08:25] <Whirl3d> hello, r3x
[11:08:36] <ajpiano> Whirl3d http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[11:09:05] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, ;) thx. I'll report back
[11:09:38] <r3x> im stuck!!! has someone gone through this issue? -- $.load() returns a 404 on Internet Explorer (8)
[11:09:57] <ajpiano> a 404 means the same thing always, you are requesting a url that doesn't exist
[11:10:09] <felo> $(this).nextAll(".commentForm:first").slideToggle(); how can I send a variable at the time it SlideToggle?
[11:10:25] <seutje> wouldn't be surprised if IE was just too stupid to find it though
[11:10:30] <r3x> ajpiano: http://pastie.org/1981866
[11:10:40] <r3x> the URL does exist
[11:10:54] <r3x> but i get a 404 on IE (only)
[11:11:00] <ajpiano> are you doing cross domain ajax?
[11:11:07] <r3x> not on chrome not on firefox not on safari not on opera
[11:11:08] <seutje> smells like x-domain
[11:11:12] <blindMoe> cross domain ajax... sounds dirty
[11:11:22] <r3x> ajpiano: no no
[11:11:29] <r3x> i was using relative urls
[11:11:29] <ajpiano> r3x: if you take the url that IE generates
[11:11:31] <SkyFlyer> any way to find out where the "Unterminated string constant" is in a script>?  Its looking at the jquery script and saying line 17000000 or something?
[11:11:35] <ajpiano> and then paste it IN to IE
[11:11:38] <ajpiano> does it work?
[11:11:58] <ajpiano> SkyFlyer, run your code through JSHint
[11:12:00] <r3x> ie /?_escaped_fragment_=
[11:12:00] <ajpiano> ?g jshint
[11:12:02] <bot-t> ajpiano, JSHint, A JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://jshint.com/
[11:12:08] <r3x> ajpiano: it does work
[11:12:12] <r3x> i can see the url
[11:12:21] <felo> ajapiano <felo> $(this).nextAll(".commentForm:first").slideToggle(); how can I send a variable at the time it SlideToggle?
[11:12:39] <r3x> i only changed it to an "absolute" url as im getting desperate and stuck
[11:12:52] <r3x> i really run out of options
[11:12:54] <Funhouse> Hi guys, just wondering if there's a function like PHP's range where I can specify a numeric range and create a function i.e range(0,4) array(0,1,2,3,4)
[11:12:57] <ajpiano> r3x: do you have a live demo
[11:13:01] <r3x> yes
[11:13:08] <JethroLarson> slideToggle(function(){
[11:13:24] <JethroLarson> that's a callback that fires when slide finishes
[11:13:31] <JethroLarson> http://jsfiddle.net/jethrolarson/xysxD/14/
[11:13:56] <r3x> ajpiano: here: http://locatelli3.53k.co.uk/#!/menu
[11:14:50] <ajpiano> ya that straight up isn't working
[11:14:52] <felo> nice
[11:14:53] <seutje> Oops! Google Chrome could not find locatelli3.53k.co.uk
[11:14:58] <JethroLarson> Funhouse: Like an empty array of a certain length?
[11:14:58] <r3x> ajpiano: http://locatelli53.53k.co.uk/?_escaped_fragment_=/menu
[11:15:09] <r3x> ajpiano: see what i mean?
[11:15:12] <felo> it means I need to do it inside the SlideToggle becuase it is going to be a function nof slide Toggle
[11:15:16] <felo> thanks Jethrolarson
[11:15:36] <felo> So it will be sent within sliding Toggle
[11:15:54] <JethroLarson> felo: within?
[11:16:02] <ajpiano> i wouldn't exactly describe this as  working in chrome

[11:16:41] <JethroLarson> felo: after, during, or before?
[11:16:48] <seutje> r3x: first link doesn't work in chrome, second does, I suspect a backend issue
[11:16:54] <felo> yes after
[11:16:55] <ajpiano> r3x: you should use something like Charles proxy
[11:17:01] <ajpiano> so you can debug the remote requests
[11:17:03] <Funhouse> hmm, not quite JethroLarson and eddiemonge , just goingto use a for loop to create
[11:17:07] <Funhouse> thank you
[11:17:14] <felo> after the slidetoggle then how response comment knows to what comment does it belogs
[11:17:15] <seutje> ?g charles proxy
[11:17:17] <bot-t> seutje, Charles Web Debugging Proxy ï HTTP Monitor / HTTP Proxy / HTTPS ... - http://www.charlesproxy.com/
[11:17:23] <felo> so It will be after
[11:17:34] <felo> I was just talking about what you did
[11:17:36] <JethroLarson> felo: via closure, I use one in the fiddle
[11:17:39] <seutje> naish, not only osx \o/
[11:17:41] <r3x> ajpiano: seutje: no no mate, i stripped the javascript completly
[11:17:50] <r3x> the site is not working now i know that
[11:17:58] <ajpiano> no, you don't have to use a remote proxy to test your ajax request?
[11:17:58] <r3x> the only javascript included is the one i pasted
[11:18:06] <felo> I saw the fiddle you did an input field with name replyCommentId
[11:18:13] <r3x> here http://locatelli53.53k.co.uk/#!/menu
[11:18:20] <r3x> if u refresh the page
[11:18:39] <r3x> u see that the request returns an 404 -- site navigation is disabled atm
[11:18:56] <felo> and the value="$id" I imagine like that then
[11:19:24] <felo> JethroLarson where did you got the commentid? from
[11:19:30] <r3x> it does return a 200 on chrome or any other browser
[11:19:36] <r3x> just not on IE (8)
[11:19:38] <r3x> :(
[11:19:51] <JethroLarson> Felo: I presumed that it exists on the server
[11:20:07] <felo> not
[11:20:18] <ajpiano> r3x: the fact that you're trying to put the hash inside of the query string is like
[11:20:21] <Mapper99> I am a newbie learning jquery mobile.  Having trouble with a 200px blank space at the top of my page.  Where is this coming from?  ex here:  http://laudontech.com/temp/changedalot/changedalot.html
[11:20:23] <ajpiano> kind of odd
[11:20:36] <felo> JethroLarson if you are talking about the commentid I see you have created a data atrribute
[11:20:51] <seutje> ooh, zen
[11:20:54] <felo> data-commentid="$id"
[11:21:32] <felo> yes I have the $id variable in the server
[11:21:34] <r3x> ajpiano: the hash inside the query string?
[11:21:39] <ajpiano> nm
[11:21:41] <JethroLarson> felo: right.
[11:21:58] <r3x> ajpiano: http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html
[11:22:02] <r3x> this is what im doing
[11:22:05] <felo> So the data atribute is like a buffer that carry information
[11:22:20] <ajpiano> i know
[11:22:30] <r3x> and this is how I get the "shebang" argument
[11:22:31] <r3x> http://pastie.org/1981866
[11:22:39] <JethroLarson> It's just a way to store arbitrary data in a tag
[11:22:48] <Anitox> Where's William Hung when you need him.
[11:22:49] <r3x> i mean all that im doing is getting the location.hash
[11:23:05] <r3x> ajpiano: do u think there is something wrong with it?
[11:23:09] <felo> ok
[11:23:12] <JethroLarson> jquery can get that data out via .data() in a convenient fashion.
[11:23:19] <r3x> cause it does alert( the correct path )
[11:24:04] <eddiemonge> Mapper99: its because your fieldcontain div has positioned properties but doesnt have a position relative or absolute on it
[11:24:05] <felo> after that then slide toggle will carry $id of the server which is contained in the commentid?
[11:24:36] <r3x> i tried jQuery 1.6.1 too
[11:24:41] <r3x> but i get the same result
[11:24:45] <felo> JethroLarson after that then slide toggle will carry $id of the server which is contained in the commentid?  meaning that now  commentid has the value of the $id right ?
[11:24:46] <r3x> :(
[11:25:03] <felo> So the variable to be used is commentid to pass the data into the database?
[11:25:26] <ajpiano> r3x: it's something to do with IE not really liking your hashes, it seems
[11:25:55] <felo> <JethroLarson> Can I Global $_GET the variable commentid and put it into a php variable to insert it in the database?
[11:25:56] <JethroLarson> felo: I used name="replyCommentID"
[11:25:58] <r3x> ajpiano: yeah i know... :(
[11:26:05] <r3x> ajpiano: well thanks anyway mate
[11:26:10] <JethroLarson> felo: I don't know php
[11:26:13] <ajpiano> sory man
[11:26:31] <felo> Jethrolarson I will refer to the input tag not to the jquery
[11:26:32] <felo> ok
[11:26:44] <seutje> think I broke my IE8 :(
[11:27:07] <felo> Jethrolarson I thought I was going to get it from the jquery but actually the value of $id is carried in the input tag
[11:27:08] <felo> ok
[11:27:08] <JethroLarson> felo: I don't know what your back end requirements are. That code doesn't work on js fiddle :)
[11:27:44] <eddiemonge> felo: global $_GET? put it into a PHP variable? $_GET already is a global var.
[11:27:48] <felo> JethroLarson I will trying $_GET['replyCommentId'];
[11:27:53] <ajpiano> felo: no one is going to sit here and hold your hand on end to end from client to server
[11:28:02] <ajpiano> if you are sending a request to your server via ajax that is far as we can take you
[11:28:12] <felo> ajpiano I have that part
[11:28:42] <ajpiano> i'm sure you do
[11:29:02] <JethroLarson> felo: replyCommentId is just a random name I chose as a post param
[11:29:08] <felo> ajpiano I was thinking about where I was going to pick up the value either from the commentid or tbut I just realize is from the name of the input hidden field
[11:29:17] <felo> Yes i know
[11:29:37] <felo> JethroLarson I know but that certainly will have the value of the $id
[11:29:49] <JethroLarson> the "101" in the fiddle would be the comment id
[11:30:21] <felo> So it goes like click comment---> jquery---- then jquery puts the value of id in the name of the hidden input like
[11:30:33] <felo> JethroLarson yes
[11:30:46] <Mapper99> >eddiemonge  Thanks, can't believe I missed that!
[11:30:56] <JethroLarson> felo: yes
[11:31:52] <felo> JethroLarson I am asking a lots of this questions because i trying to understand the sequence. I thought that after jquery processing it returned directly to the server, but I realize that it will return back to the HTML
[11:31:54] <felo> interesting
[11:31:59] <felo> then from html to the Server
[11:33:17] <JethroLarson> I'm just filling an input with js
[11:33:18] <eddiemonge> ?ajax @ felo
[11:33:19] <bot-t> felo, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:33:31] <JethroLarson> no js going to server
[11:34:07] <felo> Js is going to the server
[11:34:24] <JethroLarson> not in the fiddle
[11:34:33] <felo> but then why am I calling the name of the input tag to get the id of the comment then after sliding toggle to
[11:34:41] <felo> ok
[11:36:32] <felo> wait
[11:37:03] <felo> JethroLarson $('#replyCommentId') call the id of the input right ?
[11:37:35] <JethroLarson> that's just getting the input in order to set the value of it
[11:37:48] <felo> JethroLarson .val (commentLink.data it will link commentid value which is $id
[11:38:02] <felo> to the #replyCommentId
[11:38:03] <felo> right?
[11:38:51] <felo> then it links it and the name= attribute gets the value of the commentid through the #replyCommentId id in the input hidden tag?
[11:39:22] <JethroLarson> input.value = commentLink.getAttribute('data-commentid')
[11:39:36] <JethroLarson> if you're better with DOM
[11:40:00] <felo> JethroLarson you used .val instead of getAttribute
[11:40:10] <felo> but i understand what you saying
[11:40:21] <d4rklit3> how do i include an html
[11:40:24] <d4rklit3> into another html
[11:40:26] <felo> it is more human readable with getAttribute
[11:40:49] <felo> d4rklit3 what do you mean ?>
[11:41:07] <d4rklit3> like an iframe
[11:41:10] <d4rklit3> but not exactly
[11:41:18] <d4rklit3> isn't there an #include thing
[11:41:19] <d4rklit3> or something
[11:41:20] <d4rklit3> i dont remember
[11:42:05] <JethroLarson> I switched to Plain DOM hoping you'd understand better. I haz regret
[11:42:29] <hobs> iframe d4rklit3
[11:42:52] <felo> JethroLarson you mean you used .val instead getAttribute or the other way around?
[11:42:53] <d4rklit3> is that the only way?
[11:43:02] <hobs> if it is pure html im pretty dang sure
[11:43:21] <felo> JethroLarsonDOM mean like plain language or something like that?
[11:43:24] <d4rklit3> its a .php file im including
[11:43:31] <d4rklit3> but the file i have should be plain html
[11:43:38] <JethroLarson> d4rklit3: can use $('#mycontainer').load(url) if you want to ajax some content in from another page
[11:43:42] <hobs> php has an include, and renders plain html
[11:44:06] <hobs> php is just doing some work and sending you html in the end
[11:44:38] <d4rklit3> that sounds good
[11:44:40] <d4rklit3> jquery
[11:44:45] <JethroLarson> felo: DOM is what you use if javascript libraries don't exist
[11:44:57] <JethroLarson> for modifying the page
[11:45:32] <felo> JethroLarson meaning that it jquery can interpret ?
[11:46:00] <JethroLarson> DOM is the browser's API, jQuery uses DOM under the covers
[11:46:19] <d4rklit3> <div id='header'>  ==  $("header") or $("#header") ?
[11:46:32] <JethroLarson> don't worry about it, it was more distracting than helpful
[11:46:48] <JethroLarson> I need to give my time back to my employer, good luck.

[11:47:49] <felo> o man
[11:48:34] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/HLV8J/31/
[11:49:11] <muay-guy> hey guys.... how do I keep the rows created with this function from having the values the user adds in the first row? http://jsfiddle.net/qHrPr/1/
[11:50:15] <d4rklit3> so how do i put what i loaded into a div?
[11:50:48] <d4rklit3> i have a php loader
[11:50:49] <d4rklit3> er
[11:50:52] <d4rklit3> php header
[11:51:02] <d4rklit3> from the client, i want to load it into my html page
[11:51:27] <muay-guy> when I write something in the first row and then add another row, the new rows always have the information from the first row
[11:51:59] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, when you get a second, could you look at this fiddle and tell me if you see any obvious problems? I think it works, but you would know much better than I would. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/HLV8J/31/
[11:53:46] <jtal> anyone had a problem with a ajax PUT in firefox but not chrome?
[11:55:04] <ekkis> morning everyone
[11:56:33] <ekkis> I have a click handler for an image that makes an ajax call.  upon success of the call I want to remove the image... trouble is that "this" inside of the success handler refers to the object of parameters passed to the ajax call, not to the click handler... how can I access the image inside my success handler?
[11:57:46] <styol> ekkis: var myElem = $(this); before the ajax call, just guessing, me prolly wrong
[11:58:12] <ekkis> yes but how do I get the success handler to see that?
[11:58:44] <d4rklit3> i can't seem to load this php element into my file
[11:59:12] <d4rklit3> http://pastie.org/1982033
[11:59:14] <d4rklit3> im sure im doing it wrong
[11:59:33] * ekkis looks
[11:59:54] <styol> ekkis: due to scope, if its defined within the click, before the ajax, that var should be available within the success no?
[12:00:16] <ekkis> d4rklit3: probably easier if you do: $('#header').load('http://...')
[12:00:38] <Whirl3d> ekkis, your success handler has access to the scope you setup just before the ajax call. So var img=$(img); $.ajax (url, {success:function (data) {img.remove() works because they are in the same scope
[12:00:57] <ekkis> styol: no because "this" inside the success handler is defined as the object passed to $.ajax()
[12:01:06] <d4rklit3> $('#header').load("http://www.ifc.com/_includes/global_header_nav.php");   this doesn't do anything
[12:01:17] <styol> ekkis: thats why you define a new var that stays defined as $(this) so when you need it, its not different
[12:01:25] <jtal> styol++
[12:01:34] <ekkis> Whirl3d: really? I must be doing something wrong then... ok.  I'll retest
[12:01:49] * ekkis goes back to testing
[12:01:54] <jtal> ekkis: they are saying the same thing
[12:02:05] <ekkis> yes, I see that
[12:02:56] <jtal> ok, now back to my problems. ;) anyone ever had an ajax() call that would work in chrome but not ff?
[12:03:04] <jtal> it doesnt fail, I just dont get that params
[12:03:54] <ekkis> jtal: you don't get the parameters at the back end?  that would have nothing to do with the browser...
[12:05:05] <d4rklit3> $('#header').load("####.php");  diesplays nothing   in <div id='header'>
[12:06:38] <jtal> ekkis: what it has to do with the browser is that I get no params when in ff
[12:07:29] <d4rklit3> i dont even know wtf the client gave us
[12:07:33] <ekkis> Whirl3d, styol: it worked as you guys indicated.  I had made the mistake of setting the variable like this.MyElem = ; instead of var MyElem = ;
[12:07:49] <d4rklit3> just <il> lists no scripts no css, nothing.... just a big list tahts supposed to be their nav.. so unless im missing something they fucked up
[12:07:53] <ekkis> jtal: that's weird
[12:08:20] <ekkis> jtal: what's the back end?
[12:08:45] <Whirl3d> d4rklit3, try adding {dataType:"html" to it....I haven't looked at your code, but I had that same problem and changing the datatype worked
[12:09:05] <Whirl3d> *sorry, thought you were using .ajax...
[12:09:13] <jtal> a perl script
[12:09:17] <ekkis> jtal: I'm asking because with an MVC back-end you have to be very careful with how the stuff is submitted or the default entity mapper gets confused
[12:10:10] <d4rklit3> $("#header").load("http:/#####er_nav.php", {dataType: "html"});  ?
[12:10:12] <jtal> I'm creating a vanilla cgi that does nothing but dump back params
[12:10:17] <jtal> to prove there is something wrong
[12:10:20] <Whirl3d> jtal, are you declaring the dataType explicitly in your ajax call? I had the same problem and declaring the dataType worked for me...
[12:10:31] <Whirl3d> d4rklit3, sorry I meant to say that to jtal..
[12:10:36] <jtal> why no
[12:10:38] <jtal> no I am not
[12:10:39] <d4rklit3> heh
[12:11:16] <Whirl3d> jtal, I think something changed in 1.6....suddenly I had to declare dataType:"html" or it would just not work, wouldn't fail, but wouldn't work
[12:12:20] <ekkis> jtal... it's just hard to think the browser would be in the middle of the library... the http requests are implemented by the browser of course but a lot of that stuff is at a lower level so different browsers would just be calling into the same code
[12:14:52] <jtal> giving dataType: "html" a try ... I'm doing a PUT btw
[12:16:01] <Whirl3d> jtal, let us know if it works I haven't tried it with PUT, so it'll be good to know.
[12:16:47] <muay-guy> I'm working on a function which uses a table class as a parameter. Right now it looks like this $("table.dirtable button.add").click(function() { but I would like to make the table class dynamic
[12:16:50] <muay-guy> how do I do this?
[12:17:54] <Whirl3d> d4rklit3, have you tried ajax to load your header? Something like var header=$("#header");   $.ajax(urltoscript, {dataType:"html", success:function (data) {header.html($(data));}});
[12:18:13] <Whirl3d> d4rklit3, give or take a } or ) or something...
[12:18:19] <eddiemonge> ?data @ muay-guy
[12:18:19] <bot-t> muay-guy, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[12:18:22] <muay-guy> so that I have $("table.var button.add").click(function()
[12:19:33] <phlp> muay-guy: $("table." + classparam + " button.add")
[12:19:35] <eddiemonge> i was looking at lines 50-51 of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.dialog.js    off topic here i know but it was a jq core question
[12:20:04] <ekkis> muay-guy: $(MyTableVar).find("button.add").click()
[12:20:41] <eddiemonge> muay-guy: dont use classes as data. thats why i suggested .data()
[12:21:29] <d4rklit3> Whirl3d: yeah but i get nothing
[12:21:31] <d4rklit3> still
[12:21:35] <d4rklit3> mb it doesn't know what header is?
[12:21:36] <d4rklit3> i dunno
[12:21:37] <muay-guy> eddiemonge: why shouldn't I use classes?
[12:21:44] <muay-guy> I mean, its a class what I need
[12:22:17] <eddiemonge> semantic markup blah blah blah
[12:22:19] <Whirl3d> d4rklit3, can you log the results of the call to see if it is succeeding?
[12:22:25] <d4rklit3> <div id="header">  == $("$header") ?
[12:22:29] <d4rklit3> yeah
[12:22:33] <muay-guy> if I have two tables with different classes (now that I come think about it I should be using id's)
[12:22:41] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3: do you mean #header?
[12:22:43] <phlp> i think he is saying he wants to pass the class name to his function and find the table with the class
[12:22:46] <Whirl3d> <div id='header'>==$("#header");
[12:22:46] <d4rklit3> yes
[12:22:48] <d4rklit3> sirrt
[12:22:50] <d4rklit3> sorry
[12:23:08] <d4rklit3> i get no response
[12:23:13] <d4rklit3> 200 OK
[12:23:13] <d4rklit3> but
[12:23:21] <Whirl3d> is 'header' a reserved word?
[12:23:29] <d4rklit3> o maybe
[12:23:30] <d4rklit3> hmm
[12:23:38] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: no
[12:23:54] <Whirl3d> hmmm, thx eddiemonge
[12:24:02] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: thats why html5 turned it into a tag since everyone names their header div "header"
[12:24:05] <d4rklit3> even ifi  change it
[12:24:06] <d4rklit3> doesn't work
[12:24:19] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3: whats your question/problem?
[12:24:26] <d4rklit3> i get a 200OK on the query
[12:24:27] <d4rklit3> but
[12:24:32] <d4rklit3> i get no response headers
[12:24:33] <d4rklit3> and no response body
[12:24:40] <d4rklit3> mb i need to use get
[12:24:52] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3: thats your backend server then
[12:25:01] <d4rklit3> not mine
[12:25:04] <d4rklit3> client
[12:25:20] <d4rklit3> thats what they gave us
[12:25:20] <d4rklit3> http://www.ifc.com/_includes/global_header_nav.php
[12:26:18] <eddiemonge> whats that link?
[12:26:42] <d4rklit3> its the header
[12:26:45] <d4rklit3> i need to put into my html
[12:26:48] <d4rklit3> shit is lame anyways
[12:26:49] <d4rklit3> no styles
[12:26:51] <d4rklit3> no code
[12:26:53] <d4rklit3> its useless
[12:27:14] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3: thats still backend talk. that should be a php include
[12:31:42] <freeed> Hey guys... I've written a monster jquery library that works quite well. I'm trying to compress it now, so it loads quickly for users. I'm using http://compressorrater.thruhere.net/ to compare compressions... but every type of compression causes script errors and breaks everything :( Any ideas?
[12:33:04] <freeed> The odd thing is I tried the YUI a while back and it worked great... and the script still functioned. Is there a particular reason for a compressor to fail?
[12:34:03] <RinTinTin> Want to load html files into a div. .load() works in ff, but apparently not in chrome ( with default settings), is there any alternative?
[12:34:23] <ravenzz> ?p @ RinTinTin
[12:34:23] <bot-t> RinTinTin, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[12:34:37] <ch3mical> It works in Chrome
[12:34:53] <ch3mical> Must be a different issue
[12:35:46] <eddiemonge> freeed: have you tried google's? http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/
[12:36:05] <eddiemonge> its a typo most likely
[12:38:04] <freeed> thanks for the suggestion eddiemonge. Just found the problem. Using chrome to generate the compressed js fails. Using firefox works like a charm... odd?
[12:38:12] <RinTinTin> ch3mical: seems like it's because i'm running the site locally. according to stackoverflow, chrome doesn't allow local loading of files
[12:38:36] <eddiemonge> freeed: odd that google doesnt want you to use a competing product? nope
[12:38:53] <dipser> there is no official colorpicker from jqui right?
[12:38:58] <ch3mical> RinTinTin: see ?sop
[12:38:58] <bot-t> RinTinTin, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[12:39:45] <ch3mical> RinTinTin: FFox is probably allowing an exception, where Chrome is sticking to the SOP to the letter.
[12:40:10] <ch3mical> dipser: theme roller
[12:40:15] <eddiemonge> dipser: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137750/ColorPicker
[12:40:33] <ch3mical> Unless you mean a widget ^
[12:40:46] <eddiemonge> RinTinTin: setup a local server. dont use file:///
[12:42:01] <ch3mical> ugh, why are the jqm buttonsets so big?
[12:42:47] <ch3mical> They're 50% taller than all of the other form ui elements
[12:42:50] <eddiemonge> because they need to be for ui
[12:43:01] <ch3mical> I mean relatively, eddiemonge
[12:43:08] <RinTinTin> eddiemonge: will do!
[12:43:13] <ch3mical> Big compared to the rest of the jqm ui
[12:43:32] <eddiemonge> which? link? fiddle it!
[12:43:50] <ch3mical> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/docs/lists/lists-forms.html (look at layout view)
[12:44:09] <dipser> eddiemonge: i found that too earlier, but its not "finished" yet right?
[12:44:56] <ch3mical> Seems like the page would flow better if the height was the same as the select boxes and input boxes
[12:45:10] <Whirl3d> ch3mical, how's it going?
[12:45:27] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: it is the same height as choose a pet and snacks
[12:45:31] <ch3mical> Whirl3d: pretty good, how about yourself?
[12:46:01] <ch3mical> eddiemonge: those are not inline, though so that argument is moot
[12:46:22] <ch3mical> And I believe they are even a few pixels bigger than those as well
[12:46:31] <ch3mical> But who's counting?
[12:46:44] <eddiemonge> i am.
[12:46:49] <ch3mical> Anyway, it's not a big deal, I'm just griping
[12:46:55] <eddiemonge> it is a big deal
[12:47:02] <ch3mical> Because it means I have to do more work lol
[12:47:05] <eddiemonge> since jqm is getting ready for beta next week
[12:47:32] <ch3mical> Well for all I know they've fixed that already for the beta, I haven't checked
[12:47:40] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: file a bug https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues
[12:47:46] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: we havent
[12:47:59] <ch3mical> ok then
[12:48:57] <ch3mical> eddiemonge: maybe you can also answer my question from #jquerymobile?
[12:49:11] <ch3mical> If you're not in there, I can send it to you privately or something
[12:49:49] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: i would but i dont know the answer to it
[12:49:56] <ch3mical> Ah ok :/
[12:50:11] <eddiemonge> let me know about the bug number so i can fix that one
[12:50:16] <ch3mical> Maybe there's no event for closing dialogs, specifically
[12:53:04] <siebo> I'm having a strange issue where a previously working carousel, is not showing the items that are outside the carousel window
[12:53:15] <siebo> for example: http://m.natureandmore.com/growers/bioexotica/grower_mobile_farm
[12:53:53] <tman> can you do $(".previous:visible:last").remove() ?
[12:54:02] <ch3mical> eddiemonge: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1729
[12:54:58] <ch3mical> I wish I had time to fix things like this myself, lol
[12:59:56] <ravenzz> siebo if the css is ok...i figured out that the carousel must be visible to be initialized
[13:00:34] <siebo> ravenzz: hmm, I think it's visible, it's not hidden initially...
[13:01:07] <siebo> ravenzz: and the carousel init is inside $(document).ready(function()
[13:01:16] <siebo> so the entire page should be loaded at that time
[13:01:21] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: ok ill see if i can get to that sometime soon
[13:01:32] <ch3mical> Cool
[13:01:50] <Tant102> If I call setTimeout(secondFunction, 0) in my function, can the secondFunction execute before my current function is done?
[13:02:10] <jtal> hm, stumped. still no PUT data for ajax call from ff
[13:02:13] <ravenzz> siebo is possible that "pageshow" is being executed before the document is ready?
[13:02:20] <eddiemonge> Tant102: settimeout with 0 is the same as calling it now
[13:03:12] <siebo> ravenzz: hmm, I'm not familiar with pageshow...  have to look into that
[13:03:26] <d4rklit3> eddiemonge: lol the clients server doesn't allow php includes from remote connections
[13:03:34] <d4rklit3> iframe is the only way
[13:03:36] <ravenzz> siebo just remove(comment) it
[13:03:44] <ravenzz> and let's see what happen
[13:04:11] <ravenzz> i am not familiar too
[13:04:43] <eddiemonge> d4rklit3: oh you are trying to do a remote include. thats why its failing. see ? sop
[13:04:44] <bot-t> d4rklit3, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[13:05:09] <d4rklit3> aah
[13:05:17] <d4rklit3> eddiemonge: so it wont work regardless
[13:05:24] <d4rklit3> of php or jquery
[13:05:29] <eddiemonge> right
[13:05:57] <d4rklit3> um js syntax question, i have a .js file i want to declare a var in the file.. can a function see that var
[13:06:01] <d4rklit3> kinda like a class constant
[13:06:04] <siebo> ravenzz: I, I see where you mean, one of my colleagues must have added that
[13:06:07] <d4rklit3> actually, can I write js classes
[13:06:31] <tbranyen> ?101 @ d4rklit3
[13:06:32] <bot-t> d4rklit3, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[13:06:58] <d4rklit3> o god
[13:07:01] <d4rklit3> its just like as2
[13:07:04] <ravenzz> siebo dunno if it can help..you should try that
[13:07:06] <d4rklit3> #facepalm
[13:07:13] <siebo> ravenzz: thanks
[13:07:57] <d4rklit3> thats why there is such a divide
[13:08:05] <d4rklit3> js programmers are lazy (no offense) to learn OOP
[13:08:17] <systemfault> What?
[13:08:22] <systemfault> What is OOP?
[13:08:24] <d4rklit3> hehe jk
[13:08:29] <d4rklit3> im a flash dev
[13:08:33] <d4rklit3> i feel like i need jeer you guys a bit
[13:08:39] <d4rklit3> ill stop
[13:09:04] <systemfault> While a lot of jQuery users are clueless about programming languages, we're not all like that.
[13:09:52] <salazr> there's a difference between a guy that needs to jump from writing html all day to get jquery to do some silly thing, and doing it in a hacky way, to a guy that builds web apps
[13:10:35] <salazr> if the latter is not really doing oop, okay, that's lazy, but it's not the case that everyone needs to do oop to get a stupid file uploaded or whatever
[13:11:22] <systemfault> And of course.. JS isn't the classical java-style OOP despite its name.
[13:11:33] <systemfault> javascript.. it's not java, it's not a script.
[13:11:37] <systemfault> Fail name.
[13:11:48] <d4rklit3> systemfault: i know.. im just joshin ya
[13:11:52] <d4rklit3> i need to learn js better for sure
[13:11:57] <d4rklit3> its not going away any time soon
[13:12:02] <systemfault> Indeed
[13:12:03] <d4rklit3> but mb they will make it more like as3 in future revisions
[13:12:06] <d4rklit3> taht would be awesome
[13:12:11] <d4rklit3> and would seperate the men from the boys
[13:12:19] <systemfault> d4rklit3: I don't know AS3 to be honest
[13:12:34] <d4rklit3> are you familiar with C# or Java?
[13:12:42] <tbranyen> d4rklit3: lol
[13:12:44] <tbranyen> you're funny
[13:12:45] <systemfault> Yes, my main poison is C++ though.
[13:12:55] <tbranyen> men from the boys
[13:12:56] <d4rklit3> well AS3 isn't as hardcore as C++
[13:13:09] <dtach> can i add more than one element to respond to a click like this: $('.one, .two').click
[13:13:11] <d4rklit3> AS3 is managed
[13:13:12] <tbranyen> why would you compare them?
[13:13:24] <tbranyen> might as well compare rocks to chapstick
[13:13:27] <erichynds> dtach: you got it
[13:13:36] <dtach> phew
[13:16:49] <Whirl3d> * and with that comparison, the war began: javascript vs. AS3  or Rocks vs Chapstick...stay tuned for more after this commerical break from our sponsor: jQuery
[13:18:34] <phlp> i think the fate of flash is clear at this point
[13:18:41] <dtach> cant get stopPropagation to work on all elements that are in the div i add it to on click
[13:18:45] <hobs> denigrate programming language, receive flame war
[13:19:00] <dtach> works on some elements but not all :s
[13:20:20] <Whirl3d> phlp, yeah, with the huge number of new apps that are being developed in flash for the ios devices, I'm sure it's dead
[13:20:49] <Whirl3d> hobs ++
[13:21:28] <Whirl3d> filemaker pro ftw
[13:22:09] <dtach> am i suppose to add e.stopPropagation(); to every single element inside the main div..
[13:22:34] <dtach> what i got is a div when click hides any open popup (which are divs inside that main div)
[13:22:55] <dtach> i can click most elements inside one of these popups but some create a click through and make it hide the popup
[13:23:13] <d4rklit3> take it easy guy
[13:23:22] <d4rklit3> you can easily compare as3 to js
[13:23:28] <d4rklit3> because you can comapre as3 to as2
[13:23:31] <dtach> can i mass add it to everything inside a div?
[13:23:32] <d4rklit3> thats the difference
[13:23:43] <d4rklit3> that ppl wine about to this day
[13:24:50] <Whirl3d> dtach, are you new to jQuery?
[13:25:24] <phlp> dtach: http://api.jquery.com/event.target
[13:27:03] <dtach> i just cant wrap my head around why if i add a click to the main div all other divs i can click through instead of the space around it
[13:29:02] <Michael> What is the procedure to submit a patch for qunit?
[13:30:00] <defunct> how can I select the nearest class name above a current element but it's not inside it
[13:30:32] <jrockjiggz> defunct: above?
[13:31:07] <defunct> jrockjiggz: above, yes. Trying closest() and parents() and parent() but it's not working
[13:31:51] <jrockjiggz> $('selection').closest('.classname');
[13:32:38] <Michael> ajpiano, We want to patch qunit to work with htmlunit. The patch has no negative side effects. Do you see this being an issue?
[13:32:43] <Michael> It's a 1 line change
[13:33:24] <Michael> er, jquery
[13:33:41] <ajpiano> jquery or qunit?
[13:33:51] <Michael> jquery
[13:33:51] <defunct> jrockjiggz: I'm trying $(this).closest('.class-in-another-div-above').show(); but it's not working :/
[13:33:59] <ajpiano> you should file an enhancement ticket on the tracker
[13:34:06] <ajpiano> i can't evaluate it just based on its length :p
[13:34:29] <Michael> thanks. Will it be assigned to you, or?
[13:34:32] <jrockjiggz> thats what she said
[13:34:32] <mc_plectrum> how can i achieve that jQuery UI Draggable updates its ordering, after i called a reverse on some classes?
[13:34:36] <ajpiano> no
[13:35:06] <jrockjiggz> defunct: can you paste your html and explain what you want
[13:35:08] <ajpiano> it's a decision that all the people who evaluate the tickets will decide on there, i don't know what the nature of the change even is at this point :)
[13:35:31] <defunct> jrockjiggz: k
[13:36:40] <d4rklit3> if i have something like this:   var videoForm = "<div id='submit_video'><a href='../forms/submit_video?fb_id=$&$' target='_blank'>Submit Your Video </a></div>";
[13:36:40] <d4rklit3>     and then i want to add it to $("#main"), is it .add().html(videoForm) ?
[13:37:18] <erichynds> use appendTo(), d4rklit3
[13:37:29] <defunct> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/VwRuX/
[13:38:04] <muay-guy> suppose I have two tables and both of them have a button element with the class name "add". Considering those buttons are withing two different tables and these tables have different class names, is there a way to only retrieve the one which was clicked?
[13:38:17] <d4rklit3> aah
[13:38:21] <d4rklit3> appendTo().html()
[13:38:24] <defunct> jrockjiggz: sorry, wrong html: http://jsfiddle.net/VwRuX/1/
[13:38:32] <Michael> ajpiano, thanks
[13:38:45] <erichynds> muay-guy, "this" will be the button you clicked on within the event handler, assuming you bound the event on the buttons themselves
[13:38:59] <jrockjiggz> defunct: and what el are you trying to select?
[13:39:04] <erichynds> d4rklit3 no, $(videoForm).appendTo('#main')
[13:39:15] <erichynds> or $('#main').html( videoForm )
[13:39:32] <muay-guy> erichynds: but is there  a way to get that button's table class?
[13:39:43] <d4rklit3> erichynds: the latter replaces everything in that div
[13:39:49] <Michael> ajpiano, may I pm you?
[13:39:52] <Michael> It'll be quick
[13:40:01] <ajpiano> sure
[13:40:03] <defunct> jrockjiggz: add-topic-bubble (it's set to display: none; I want to show it after the box is cleared)
[13:40:07] <muay-guy> not the buttons' class which is always the same, but the table's class
[13:40:14] <defunct> jrockjiggz: selected as "focused" I mean
[13:40:16] <erichynds> muay-guy yes, $(this).closest('table').attr("class")
[13:40:26] <erichynds> d4rklit3 correct, so use the former
[13:40:31] <muay-guy> erichynds: thanks, I'll try that
[13:40:33] <erichynds> wasn't sure what you wanted exactly..
[13:40:50] <muay-guy> yeah, it's kind of difficult to explain I guess
[13:40:52] <djQuery> defunct: why not use a <input placeholder="enter Topic" type="text" />   also see ?placeholder
[13:40:53] <bot-t> defunct, https://github.com/mathiasbynens/Placeholder-jQuery-Plugin - A jQuery plugin which enables HTML5 placeholder behavior for browsers that aren‚Äôt trying hard enough yet
[13:42:11] <defunct> djQuery: because the clearing is a lot less code?
[13:42:24] <d4rklit3> yay  i can haz jquery
[13:42:43] <phlp> defunct: jQuery(this).closest('.topic-box').find(".add-topic-bubble").show();
[13:42:44] <Tant102> Can I tell jQuery to not send any cookies when doing ajax calls?
[13:43:12] <erichynds> Tant102 no, your browser does it automatically.  not jquery
[13:43:24] <defunct> phlp: you're a gentleman and a scholar. Thanks a lot
[13:44:32] <dtach> ARG
[13:45:09] <djQuery> damn I suck at css. http://jsfiddle.net/UsLnM/12/ cant get the trash can icon to show on the same line as the span
[13:45:12] <muay-guy> I'm sorry erichynds but not sure what's not working, can you please check this? http://jsfiddle.net/qHrPr/2/
[13:46:01] <dtach> so if i cant use stopPropagation with live() what should i do?
[13:46:06] <erichynds> muay-guy try http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/qHrPr/4/
[13:46:35] <jrockjiggz> defunct: http://www.dygmm.com/js/jquery.clearValue.js
[13:46:41] <erichynds> you don't need to be so specific with your selectors
[13:47:03] <erichynds> oh wait, you're nesting tables like they're going out of style
[13:47:14] <muay-guy> thanks a lot, I can't figure what you changed
[13:47:16] <muay-guy> ???
[13:48:33] <erichynds> muay-guy look at the 2 versions side by side :)
[13:49:31] <muay-guy> yes I can see the difference now, thanks. What did you mean by nesting tables like they are going out of style though?
[13:49:53] <erichynds> yeah forget that, you aren't closing one of your <td>'s so in fiddle it looks like nested tables
[13:50:02] <erichynds> on a quick glance
[13:50:22] <muay-guy> ohhh I see
[13:50:37] <muay-guy> anyways, thanks a lot for your help. I thought this would be much harder
[13:50:41] <erichynds> np
[13:53:01] <phlp> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/UsLnM/14/
[13:55:00] <blindMoe> phlp: great little tagging system
[13:55:44] <phlp> it's djQuery's the only thing i contributed was inline-block :)
[13:56:00] <blindMoe> hehe oh.. well nice looking tag system none the less ;)
[14:03:47] <albertosheinfeld> why .remove() doesn't work even though if i alert($('#box')) it appears as an object??
[14:03:49] <abjorn> whoop. got an interview for a tech support position at hostgator
[14:03:59] <albertosheinfeld> is there a problem with absolute position and remove or something???
[14:05:00] <ccmonster> how do i get a flyout menu using the jquery ui menu ?
[14:05:01] <phlp> try alert($('bob'))
[14:06:11] <phlp> point being it will be an object even if nothing is found, and you shouldn't use alert for that
[14:06:48] <albertosheinfeld> but i created a div with id="box"
[14:07:05] <albertosheinfeld> shouldn't $('#box').remove() dissapear it???
[14:07:16] <jrockjiggz> yes
[14:07:26] <albertosheinfeld> :( it's not...
[14:07:37] <mutex_> is it possible to do a function return in sortable cancel
[14:07:38] <nirvisual> check your console for errors
[14:07:40] <albertosheinfeld> anyone know's of a good tooltip for images?
[14:07:49] <mutex_> i wanted to do some nifty dynamic cancel parameter
[14:07:52] <albertosheinfeld> so that i don't have to code it myself?
[14:08:08] <nirvisual> albertosheinfeld: check out qtip
[14:09:42] <phlp> albertosheinfeld: is that in $(document).ready(function() { ..here.. });
[14:10:24] <albertosheinfeld> no it;s not there :) let me check if that helps
[14:10:25] <albertosheinfeld> thanks!
[14:10:30] <albertosheinfeld> and i will check qtip
[14:10:32] <albertosheinfeld> thanks!
[14:19:23] <m0dmd> what's going on errbody!
[14:19:33] <hobs> not much
[14:19:41] <hobs> whats the haps
[14:19:53] <m0dmd> workin it out :)
[14:19:59] <m0dmd> facebook app dev right now
[14:20:11] <Justin_> I'm trying to find a good jquery plugin for loading animations, what's a good one?
[14:21:56] <Funhouse> What is the best color animation plugin?
[14:24:35] <ccmonster> i have no clue how to turn this jquery ui menu into a flyout
[14:24:39] <ccmonster> it automatically turns into a list
[14:25:20] <dtach> the result list that jquery UI shows is ignoring my css z-index, and it is not showing up because of that if i edit the z-index with dev tools in chrome to z-index:999; i can see the list just fine, any way of fixing this? (so dont let it choose its own z-index)
[14:32:24] <mitnavn> Any idea why http://pastie.org/private/ozv9oqccn2lik8krod5pdg wouldn't work? It seems like it should :/
[14:33:42] <phlp> $(href) doesnt make any sense
[14:34:51] <mitnavn> I should probably say the links all link to different parts of the page - href="#footnote"
[14:36:19] <ngharo> you probably have an empty selector.  use console.log() to find out
[14:36:48] <rethus> how can i split a string on each linebreak?
[14:37:33] <dtach> it does z-index:81; cant figure out why or how to change it
[14:37:46] <phlp> rethus: .split('\n')
[14:37:47] <dtach> even the field im adding it to has a way higher z-index
[14:38:07] <ngharo> "foo\nbar\ntest\nbanana".split(/\n/g)
[14:38:25] <ngharo> ?js "foo\nbar\ntest\nbanana".split(/\n/g)
[14:38:26] <bot-t> ngharo: ["foo", "bar", "test", "banana"]
[14:38:42] <rethus> ccool, thanks
[14:38:54] <ngharo> phlp's works equally as well
[14:39:07] <rethus> yes, but i need the regex one
[14:39:10] <rethus> thanks to both
[14:40:09] <mitnavn> ngharo: Yes, it returns null. I don't know why though, any ideas?
[14:41:35] <muay-guy> when you're cloning an input element with .clone(), how do you keep it from cloning the values too?
[14:42:06] <muay-guy> because I'm trying adding .val(""); but it still clones the values
[14:42:23] <rethus> how can i print an array n console.log?
[14:42:37] <djQuery> phlp: cool thanks I had tried inline just not inline block
[14:42:41] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/XXtem/1/
[14:42:49] <rethus> above is the string with linebreak
[14:42:53] <ngharo> mitnavn: which part? $(href) ?
[14:43:09] <bapi__> $('#resultform .info').click(function(){ getInfo() }
[14:43:15] <bapi__>  how can i pass the .info element in getinfo()?
[14:43:17] <rethus> linebreak not as string \n but "hit enter" inside the text
[14:44:05] <rethus> i wan't split the valiue line by line and trim them.
[14:45:42] <ngharo> mitnavn: try this inside your click handler:  var href = this.href.split('/').pop();
[14:45:43] <dtach1> anyone know how to fix the z-index of the autocomplete results list
[14:46:07] <dtach1> its not using css but changing style="" on the page itself
[14:46:21] <ngharo> bapi__: .click(function() { getInfo(this) }
[14:46:25] <ngharo> )
[14:46:41] <bapi__> I tried that didnt seem to work
[14:47:02] <bapi__> $('#resultform .info').click(function(){SelectText(this);});
[14:47:14] <trumpetmic>  how do i ensure my newly-created theme gets used on all pages in my liferay instance?
[14:47:20] <bapi__> it worked when i had $('#resultform .info').click(function(){SelectText('info');});
[14:47:55] <ngharo> bapi__: is SelectText( ) aware that it's being passed a DOM node now?
[14:48:17] <ngharo> not a string
[14:50:00] <bapi__> oh my bad
[14:50:04] <bapi__> hade a getElementById
[14:50:09] <bapi__> I just passed a astring
[14:51:56] <mitnavn> ngharo: Nope. It's returning the same string as $(this).attr('href') but it's not working.
[14:55:41] <ngharo> rethus1: does this help at all: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/XXtem/3/
[14:57:04] <dtach1> omfg >___<
[14:57:16] <ngharo> mitnavn: are you sure?  http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/zeR2L/
[14:57:19] <dtach> no option to change the z-index wtf
[14:57:41] <ngharo> .css('z-index', ONEBILLION)
[14:58:08] <dtach> yeah but how can i hook it to the autocomplete
[14:58:14] <dtach> i mean whenever it changes the z-index
[14:58:18] <rethus1> ngharo: thanks, i check and try to understand it
[14:59:39] <phlp> mitnavn: http://jsfiddle.net/zeR2L/1/
[15:01:21] <KWhat_Work> is there a way to detect if a scroll bar was clicked?
[15:01:39] <ngharo> :/ $(this).attr('href') returns differently than this.href for anchors... interesting
[15:02:30] <mitnavn> ngharo, phlp: Thanks, that's basically what I have so obviously something is broken. Thanks for the help, at least I know it's not the code
[15:03:47] <phlp> KWhat_Work: http://api.jquery.com/scroll
[15:03:49] <ngharo> ok nm, this.href always returns full path i guess
[15:05:01] <rethus1> ngharo: what is map() doing. i didn't found this function in selfhtml
[15:05:09] <rethus1> or is it jquery?
[15:05:42] <ch3mical> jquery

[15:06:57] <dtach> and how do i target class="ui-autocomplete ui-menu ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all" ? .ui-autocomplete wont work
[15:07:00] <felo-rachmaninof> hello
[15:07:56] <phlp> dtach: $('.ui-autocomplete.ui-menu')
[15:08:04] <felo-rachmaninof> ajpiano I am having a problem with a data-attribute of a span tag that wraps a a tag
[15:08:18] <felo-rachmaninof> I am send a hidden field but the variable is not being sent
[15:08:28] <dtach> phlp: dots in all spaces?
[15:09:10] <phlp> dtach: .class1.class2 means it has both
[15:09:32] <felo-rachmaninof> felo-rachmaninof: yyou got the code
[15:09:55] <dtach> still not working, @#@#$@$ autocomplete
[15:10:31] <dtach> i'll just make a custom build and remove that crappy z-index line
[15:11:25] <phlp> or you could use !important if you want to be an outcast
[15:11:27] <felo-rachmaninof> $('#replyCommentId').val(commentLink.data('commentid')); this line is either not getting the data-commentid or not sending the #replyCommentId hidden input field
[15:12:14] <felo-rachmaninof> i do a Vardump($replyCommentId) and is #replyCommentId is passing empty
[15:12:16] <KWhat_Work> does a mouse down event happen after a focus out event ?
[15:12:50] <dtach> phlp: it's just weirding out selecting the z-index of the main div the textfield is in but even then it should still peek out underneath the main div but its completely hidden (way below all the other stuff on the page)
[15:13:05] <dtach> if it just took the 999 from css it would be solved
[15:13:41] <felo-rachmaninof> dtach can you help me on this $('#replyCommentId').val(commentLink.data('commentid')); the replyCommentId is the id and name of a hidden input tag bu it is passing empty
[15:13:58] <felo-rachmaninof> will .getAttribute work better than .val?
[15:14:21] <felo-rachmaninof> replyCommentId here $('#replyCommentId').val(commentLink.data('commentid')); is no passing the variable to an hidden input tag
[15:14:22] <felo-rachmaninof> help
[15:14:35] <phlp> dtach: it should work with z-index:999 !important; but it's bad form
[15:14:42] <dtach> felo-rachmaninof: post an example on fiddle, which could help you out too
[15:14:48] <felo-rachmaninof> ok
[15:14:51] <dtach> phlp: eww indeed :(
[15:15:47] <mitnavn> The problem seems to be with jQuery's handling of a colon in the id.
[15:16:02] <bot-t> If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[15:17:05] <felo-rachmaninof> dtach http://jsfiddle.net/DN5he/
[15:17:10] <felo-rachmaninof> that the jsfiddle
[15:18:03] <dtach> i didnt get your question about this though
[15:18:08] <dtach> and set it to jQuery, did it for you http://jsfiddle.net/DN5he/1/
[15:18:36] <dtach> what is it suppose to do
[15:18:52] <Yon0> hey I'm having trouble getting a jquery function to work on click, would anyone be willing to take a look?
[15:19:24] <felo-rachmaninof> dtach it is suppose to slidetoggle
[15:19:28] <felo-rachmaninof> I think it is doing it
[15:19:37] <felo-rachmaninof> and send a $id variable
[15:19:43] <felo-rachmaninof> to the $_POST
[15:20:07] <felo-rachmaninof> which I guess it will be send through the data-commentid=$id right?
[15:20:32] <dtach> phlp: its just annoying, now i got to host a 75KB js file to work around this :s
[15:20:38] <felo-rachmaninof> dtach in the hidden input field value attribute what is suppose to go there?
[15:23:25] <dtach> phlp: odd i went over to the CDN version and now its picking the css z-index
[15:23:41] <dtach> *.12 to *.13
[15:23:52] <dtach> idk.. either way, problem solved and an hour wasted on nothing
[15:24:12] <felo-rachmaninof> dtach in the fiddle you sent me what did you edited?
[15:24:41] <dtach> nothing, just set the framework on the left to jQuery
[15:24:51] <phlp> dtach: the code looks like it is adding 1 to the z-index of the input
[15:24:52] <dtach> i really dont get what you need, it's sliding in and out here
[15:25:17] <felo-rachmaninof> dtach I have a server variable call $id
[15:25:23] <dtach> phlp: yes, but it wasnt using the right element over here, but now with the 1.8.13 version its working
[15:26:07] <felo-rachmaninof> I want to set the data-commentid int he span tag to that server variable and carry that variable when I slide toggle so that the response form knows to what id will the response belongs
[15:26:15] <felo-rachmaninof> dtach I want to set the data-commentid int he span tag to that server variable and carry that variable when I slide toggle so that the response form knows to what id will the response belongs
[15:26:24] <ngharo> oh dear...
[15:26:50] <felo-rachmaninof> ngharo: still having trouble with the comment response
[15:27:59] <jshannon> Hi. Do you guys cover jquery ui questions as well?
[15:28:00] <felo-rachmaninof> I have added the data-comment attribute to the span tag that wraps the a tags link the text comment. then I equal data-commentid = $id
[15:29:08] <trumpetmic> i asked this question yesterday and got some good clues, but have since lost them (sorry!):  what's a good way to add navigation to communities, from the nav bar, rather than the admin dock?
[15:29:43] <ngharo> felo-rachmaninof: imo you should just start over.  read the post docs and go off an example
[15:29:47] <ngharo> ?post @ felo-rachmaninof
[15:29:48] <bot-t> felo-rachmaninof, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[15:32:12] <jshannon> i've got draggable set up on some divs . everything was working fine until recently (when I made a bunch of unrelated changes). and now as soon as i pick up the draggable it jumps straight up (about 200 px).  I can move it around but it's just ~200px high. And when I let go, it snaps back, but ~200px high. i've commented out almost all of the other code. no joy.
[15:33:19] <felo-rachmaninof> can I send a data attribute like this $form.find( 'span[data="commentid"]' ).val(), url = $form.attr( 'action' );
[15:33:34] <KWhat_Work> is there somwhere i can look up event order
[15:33:39] <felo-rachmaninof> ngharo: can I send a data attribute like this $form.find( 'span[data="commentid"]' ).val(), url = $form.attr( 'action' );
[15:34:00] <felo-rachmaninof> data is an attribute field found in a span tag
[15:34:02] <ngharo> no that doesnt send anything
[15:34:54] <ngharo> val() only works on inputs
[15:35:04] <felo-rachmaninof> on inputs ok
[15:35:17] <felo-rachmaninof> getAttribute then would be better
[15:35:32] <felo-rachmaninof> $form.find( 'span[data="commentid"]' ).getAttribute(),
[15:35:50] <felo-rachmaninof> that would get the value of commentid?

[15:44:45] <ngharo> probably next to nil
[15:49:15] <felo-rachmaninof> ngharho: I have added this line $.post ("profile.php", { replyCommntId: ".commentid", id: "$uid"}, to send those variables through profile.php, don't know if I co uld useserver variables and script it like I did. how can I re-write a server variable in a way jquery understan?
[15:51:19] <felo-rachmaninof> dtach:  $.post ("profile.php", { replyCommntId: ".commentid", id: "$uid"}
[15:51:30] <felo-rachmaninof> can I se a server variable in jquery?
[15:52:06] <felo-rachmaninof> set to
[15:53:56] <ngharo> felo-rachmaninof: get your form working without jquery first
[15:53:58] <ngharo> then come back
[15:54:19] <felo-rachmaninof> it is working without it
[15:54:20] <muay-guy> what should I use instead of .clone() if I am creating new rows and I want each new row created to have a different name like name[] ?
[15:54:23] <felo-rachmaninof> it submit
[15:55:15] <felo-rachmaninof> it does insert but it insert in the parent comment field
[15:55:50] <ngharo> try #php on how to get your php variable to post
[15:55:59] <felo-rachmaninof> ok
[15:56:09] <felo-rachmaninof> I think I will do taht see later ngharo need to go
[16:05:10] <muay-guy> when creating new rows, what should I use instead of clone() if I don't want all input names to be the same?
[16:08:05] <sshow> will addClass() add class to an element that already has the class you
[16:08:11] <sshow> you're attempting to add *
[16:08:57] <ch3mical> Probably. Try it.
[16:10:46] <ngharo> muay-guy: you can manipulate the clone before writing it to the DOM
[16:13:59] <muay-guy> ngharo: so if I want to do something like that I can somehow append a name to it using a counter or something like that?
[16:15:17] <ngharo> sure
[16:15:27] <pifantastic> muay-guy: might be a good time to use a template system
[16:16:04] <muay-guy> pifantastic: what do you mean?
[16:16:17] <ngharo> var clone = $(something).clone();  clone.find('input).each(function() { $(this).attr('name', $(this).attr('name') + 'wangdoozle')) });
[16:21:27] <ShawnRisk> how do I show text overlay over an image that is from the alt or title tags from the active image?
[16:25:58] <mloskot> Hi, I'm inexperienced jQuery user, starting  to learn in fact and I'm trying to manipulate form select options, can anyone explain me why the options object is undefind (that's what Firebug is telling me),
[16:25:59] <mloskot>         var select = $('#myId'); var options = select.attr('options');
[16:26:22] <mloskot> This technique seems to be very popular, at least google says so
[16:26:39] <systemfault> mloskot: Is options an attribute of select?
[16:27:07] <systemfault> Seems it's the case, just looked :/
[16:27:28] <mloskot> systemfault, hmm, I assume it's a built-in attribute, isn' tit?
[16:27:47] <systemfault> It's a DOM attribute
[16:27:55] <systemfault> So, .attr "should" work
[16:28:09] <mloskot> Right, means the code looks OK?
[16:28:29] <ShawnRisk1> any ideas on my problem?
[16:28:38] <systemfault> Of course, you could get around it with .find("option") or something similar
[16:29:02] <systemfault> What the hell with jsfiddle today :(
[16:29:55] <ngharo> options are a child of select not an attribute
[16:30:21] <systemfault> ngharo: The DOM references state that HTMLSelectElement has a options attribute though
[16:30:27] <systemfault> http://krook.org/jsdom/HTMLSelectElement.html
[16:30:37] <systemfault> Eww wrong site
[16:30:52] <systemfault> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLSelectElement
[16:31:29] <systemfault> Seems that jsfiddle's dead (Perhaps it's just me)
[16:32:09] <ngharo> its a prop on the dom node
[16:32:15] <ngharo> $('select').get().options would probably work
[16:32:27] <phishbot> jsfiddle is down for me too systemfault
[16:32:44] <mloskot> Interesting. Simply, I'm following this http://www.electrictoolbox.com/json-data-jquery-php-mysql/
[16:32:49] <systemfault> I thought that .attr was a DOM passthrough, I guess I was wrong :(
[16:32:50] <rosieres> Does anybody know how to force print background images if you call the print dialog by print(); ?
[16:32:52] <mloskot> perhaps something changed
[16:33:34] <ngharo> mloskot: i bet if you use prop() instead of attr() it'll work
[16:33:52] <ngharo> else $('select').children() would get what you need too
[16:33:54] <systemfault> ngharo: I just read the doc :P You're totally right :)
[16:34:11] <systemfault> (Since 1.6, it returns undefined)
[16:34:43] <mloskot> ngharo, yes, indeed. var options = select.prop('options'); gives options as HTMLOptoinsCollection
[16:35:13] <mloskot> systemfault, which doc you mean? JS DOM or jQuery?
[16:35:26] <systemfault> mloskot: DOM
[16:35:42] <mloskot> sorry if I sound silly, but I'm still blindly walking among those trees
[16:35:47] <mloskot> thanks
[16:35:54] <ngharo> jq blog has a writeup about attr/prop changes if you're interested
[16:35:59] <systemfault> mloskot: Anyway, like ngharo said, .prop should be used
[16:37:12] <mloskot> ngharo, yes I am, I like to know where things come from
[16:37:20] <mloskot> systemfault, it does
[16:38:15] <ngharo> blog.jquery.com :)
[16:38:29] <ShawnRisk1> jsfiddle is down
[16:38:40] <ngharo> The .prop() method should be used for boolean attributes/properties and for properties which do not exist in html (such as window.location). All other attributes (ones you can see in the html) can and should continue to be manipulated with the .attr() method.
[16:38:45] <ngharo> that's a great summary
[16:39:12] <mloskot> ngharo, got it, thanks. Reading.
[16:39:52] <ShawnRisk1> How do I make a text overlay for images that use alt or text as the text?  I know that I .hover or .animate for the overlay but beyond that I am confused with the text.  Any ideas on how I can do this?
[16:40:51] <ngharo> you can get the alt text via $(this).attr('alt') inside your hover handler
[16:41:08] <diegoviola> hi
[16:41:09] <diegoviola> do you guys know of a jquery plugin to do something similar like this: http://www.flashimap.com/worldview/united_states_selection_form.php
[16:41:21] <ShawnRisk1> ngharo: what if I am using .animate instead?
[16:41:35] <ngharo> what triggers the animate?
[16:42:00] <ShawnRisk1> ngharo: hover stupid me
[16:43:37] <ngharo> you probably want to set the set the text before you animate it anyhow
[16:44:00] <Whirl3do> Hey all. Question about .trigger and .one  Can I use .one to ensure that my image doesn't call the load function twice?
[16:44:09] <ngharo> $(overlay).text($(this).attr('alt')).animate( ... )
[16:44:52] <ShawnRisk1> ngharo: okay, but how do I put the text in the <p> tag?
[16:45:09] <ngharo> select it and set it via .text() or .html()
[16:45:27] <ShawnRisk1> oh right .html
[16:45:48] <Whirl3do> $(img).one("load", loadHandler).attr("src", someurl).each(function () {if (this.complete) {$(this).trigger("load");});
[16:45:57] <ngharo> Whirl3do: yep pretty sure that's the point of one()
[16:46:25] <Whirl3do> So, even though I am manually calling trigger on it, it won't load a second time, right?
[16:46:28] <m0dmd> sup everyone.
[16:46:41] <Whirl3do> Good Evening m0dmd
[16:46:52] <m0dmd> sup Whirl3do how r things buddy
[16:46:59] <ngharo> Whirl3do: pretty sure it'll get unbinded after it's called the first time
[16:47:17] <Whirl3do> ngharo, thanks for the reply.
[16:47:25] <m0dmd> project coming along good?
[16:47:37] <Whirl3do> m0dmd, really well thank you. Just about done with this big project (just fixing bugs now)
[16:47:56] <m0dmd> sweet!
[16:48:06] <m0dmd> good stuff man good stuff
[16:48:21] <ShawnRisk1> ngharo: like this: jQuery(".field-content .photo", this).attr('alt').html(); ?
[16:48:29] <m0dmd> I'm finishing up this facebook application
[16:49:51] <diegoviola> I found it https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster
[16:50:21] <ngharo> ShawnRisk1: no
[16:50:43] <ngharo> attr('alt') returns a string of the alt attribute
[16:50:44] <lenswipe> hey guys
[16:51:04] <lenswipe> i want to find all the images in a div and wrap them in <a> tags using jquery - how would i do this?
[16:51:37] <ShawnRisk1> ngharo: which is the alt of the image right?
[16:51:55] <ngharo> ShawnRisk1: if that is what your selector is grabbing, yeah
[16:52:44] <ngharo> ?wrap @ lenswipe
[16:52:45] <bot-t> lenswipe, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/

[16:54:32] <ian_> quick question: do fadeIn/Out and animations work well with firefox
[16:54:51] <superjacaman> ian_: yeah
[16:54:59] <lenswipe> ngharo using that method how do i get the src= of the image and make it the href for the anchor tag?
[16:55:53] <Whirl3do> m0dmd, what kind of facebook app (sorry, I stepped away for some fresh mango, mmmm mm)
[16:56:16] <ian_> superjacaman, I'm finding them really laggy on my browser. Do you know any way ways to stop that from happening. It seems to be working fine with chrome
[16:56:40] <m0dmd> really simple music sharing app, I am recoding the flow of it right now. But should be done in a couple of minutes.
[16:56:41] <superjacaman> ian_: code plz
[16:57:09] <ShawnRisk> ngharo:  I want to select the alt of the image and put that in a p tag.  The code I am using will not do that right?  The name of the image tag is <div class="field-content photo"><img src="" alt="ShawnRisk"></div> and the area I want to put the alt in is <div class="cover slider"><p></p></div>  How do I make sure I am selecting the right element first?
[16:57:48] <rosieres> Does anybody know how to oen a certain container, that already is loaded on the page to show within a popup window ?
[16:58:09] <rosieres> on click
[16:58:12] <ngharo> lenswipe: $('div img').each(function() { $(this).wrap('<a src="'+this.src+'" />') }); something liek that
[16:58:29] <lenswipe> thanks man

[17:00:45] <lenswipe> ngharo see what im trying to do?
[17:00:50] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: any further ideas on mine?
[17:01:10] <ian_> superjacaman,  http://pastie.org/1982988
[17:01:33] <ngharo> lenswipe: $("#content img") selects multiple images right

[17:01:51] <lenswipe> ngharo right
[17:02:07] <lenswipe> ngharo it should give me all the images #content which is what i want :p
[17:02:16] <lenswipe> ngharo would you like a link to my site to mess with?
[17:02:27] <ngharo> this has no context, you need to loop over the images and get src and set it in the anchor
[17:02:35] <ngharo> lenswipe: no i think we got this
[17:02:42] <lenswipe> ok
[17:02:57] <lenswipe> so..?
[17:03:10] <superjacaman> ian_: code is right maybe something in firefox lot of things open? or something...

[17:03:22] <ian_> oooh
[17:03:34] <ian_> would running on a vm be a problem?
[17:03:37] <lenswipe> ngharowas that for me?
[17:03:38] <ngharo> lenswipe: replace your wrap call with that
[17:03:40] <ngharo> yeah
[17:03:41] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: http://pastebin.com/G1enfaXv
[17:03:50] <lenswipe> ngharo in case no i didnt see it

[17:03:59] <ian_> not that I haven't given it enough juice
[17:04:04] <ian_> it's localhost
[17:04:10] <ngharo> lenswipe: .each(function() { $(this).wrap('<a src="'+this.src+'" />') });
[17:04:17] <lenswipe> ah right ok
[17:04:26] <lenswipe> ngharo so i replace wrap() onwards with that?
[17:04:27] <superjacaman> maybe something temporary not wrong in the code
[17:04:39] <ngharo> yep
[17:04:50] <lenswipe> magic
[17:04:51] <lenswipe> it works
[17:04:54] <lenswipe> thank you very much
[17:06:22] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: what is .block ?
[17:09:12] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: is just the div above the .cover one
[17:10:15] <ngharo> the image is inside it, ya?
[17:11:59] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: http://pastebin.com/bpRM4dxQ i think this is close to what you need
[17:12:28] <Sirisian> How do I do something as simple as var canvas = document.createElement("canvas"); this code doesn't return the element $(document).append("canvas");. Someone yesterday mentioned like: var tileAtlasCanvas = $("<canvas></canvas>"); $(document).append(tileAtlasCanvas); but tielAtlasCanvas isn't valid.
[17:12:46] <Sirisian> tile*
[17:13:33] <snover> ?append @ Sirisian
[17:13:34] <bot-t> Sirisian, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[17:13:52] <Sirisian> snover, can you be more specific?
[17:14:08] <Sirisian> How do I get a reference to the object like the one returned by document.createElement?
[17:14:15] <snover> ?get @ Sirisian
[17:14:15] <bot-t> Sirisian, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[17:14:48] <ngharo> var foo = $('<canvas />'); $('body').append(foo); works for me
[17:15:10] <Sirisian> foo.getContext("2d");
[17:15:16] <Sirisian> would be invalid
[17:15:22] <Sirisian> snover, thanks I'll try that
[17:15:45] <snover> read the entire page.
[17:15:46] <djQuery> ngharo: $('<canvas />').appendTo('body')  should work
[17:15:51] <ShawnRisk> .block doesn't have the images, it is .slides
[17:16:20] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: ^
[17:17:33] <lenswipe> ngharo got a slightly different problem, wonder if you can help
[17:18:01] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: is it possible to bind the hover handler to a div parent to the image?
[17:18:14] <ngharo> else we don't have a context of which image to pull the alt text from
[17:19:01] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: yes I believe so
[17:19:23] <ngharo> ?ask@lenswipe
[17:19:23] <bot-t> lenswipe, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:20:27] <lenswipe> ngharo its a framework called easyfrontend thats jquery based, im using it on one of my pages and for some reason the jquery isnt firing, wonder if you could run your eye through it and see if theres anything obviously wrong
[17:20:52] <Sirisian> snover, Is there a way to do var tileAtlasCanvas = $("#tileAtlasCanvas").get(0); ?
[17:20:59] <lenswipe> ngharo http://95.146.94.58/stpeters2/heritage
[17:21:07] <snover> ?tias @ Sirisian
[17:21:07] <bot-t> Sirisian, Try It And See
[17:21:13] <Sirisian> no it didn't work
[17:21:18] <Sirisian> I meant is there a way that works
[17:21:26] <d4rklit3> jquery is neat
[17:21:36] <snover> Sirisian: it works exactly as programmed
[17:21:42] <d4rklit3> its like the lego star wars of programming
[17:21:53] <Sirisian> snover, indeed
[17:22:03] <Taggnostr> can I put two values in the :not() selector?
[17:22:25] <Taggnostr> like :not(:first-child, #someid)
[17:22:55] <ngharo> lenswipe: what do you mean "isnt firing"
[17:23:07] <lenswipe> ngharo are you aware of how easyfrontend works?
[17:23:19] <ngharo> not at all
[17:23:40] <lenswipe> its a html framework that lets you use jquery by setting CSS classes on things
[17:23:44] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: you are thinking of using .bind like jquery('.slides').blind("hover", ?
[17:24:12] <lenswipe> ngharo like to create a javascript tooltip you set 'class="tooltip"' on an element and then title="Tooltip text" to make it say something
[17:24:22] <ngharo> neat
[17:24:27] <lenswipe> ngharo bottom line is, im setting the usual classes on stuff and no js is being fred
[17:24:30] <lenswipe> fired*
[17:25:11] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: i dunno i'd have to see your markup.  you could just wrap the image and overlay in a new div and replace .block with that, then my paste should work
[17:25:50] <ngharo> lenswipe: view source.  look at the script tags
[17:25:57] <lenswipe> i dont need script tags
[17:26:07] <ngharo> lenswipe: im telling you man
[17:26:08] <lenswipe> i told you, it works by setting css classes
[17:26:10] <ngharo> please look
[17:26:27] <lenswipe> ngharo and im saying there arent any because it uses css classes
[17:26:38] <ngharo> lenswipe: im saying you should right click > view source
[17:26:45] <lenswipe> ngharo i know how view source works
[17:26:46] <ngharo> and look at script tags in your head
[17:26:51] <lenswipe> oh those ones?
[17:26:52] <lenswipe> what about em
[17:27:11] <ngharo> cmon you can see the problem
[17:27:11] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: markup: http://pastebin.com/3JQUdBKw
[17:27:13] <DanAKAHollywood> Hey all.
[17:27:18] <lenswipe> ngharo not at all
[17:27:23] <ngharo> lenswipe: you're including two diff version of jquery
[17:27:41] <lenswipe> ngharo it shouldnt matter, besides i remove that now and the problem persists
[17:28:21] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: I joined the conversation a bit late. What is the problem you are having?
[17:28:37] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood are you familiar with "EasyFrontEnd" ?
[17:28:44] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: can you get me the rendered markup (no php)
[17:28:46] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood http://easyframework.com/
[17:28:52] <rosieres_> superjacaman: found a solution that seems to be more suitable form me . . .  but it doesn¥t seem to work. Do you have an Idea why the content isn¥t appended ?? http://jsfiddle.net/2MQD5/
[17:28:53] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: No bug I'm sure I could be rather quickly.
[17:29:16] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood its a html framework that provides minimal jquery simply by having the user set classes on elements
[17:29:20] <ngharo> lenswipe: are you sure you dn't have to initialize easy?
[17:29:26] <lenswipe> ngharo positive
[17:29:49] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood for instance a js popup with "helllo" would be: <h1 class="tooltip" title="hello">Something</h1>
[17:29:59] <lenswipe> ngharo look at their website
[17:30:06] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Bear with me, I'm on the ipad switching back and forth.
[17:30:07] <lenswipe> ngharo http://easyframework.com/easy1.0/demo.html
[17:30:15] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood oh man, that sucks
[17:30:45] <cooki3s> anyone good with selections who can help me - what the regex to select all elements of the tag type IMG with attribute SRC="anything"???
[17:31:01] <superjacaman> rosieres_: trying something here wait
[17:31:25] <systemfault> cooki3s: What's the link with regex?
[17:31:28] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Alright, I get the gist of it. What is the issue you are seeing?
[17:31:44] <systemfault> cooki3s: $('img[src]') ?
[17:31:47] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood i set css classes and it does nothing
[17:32:06] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood its like javascript is turned off - except i know its not because i have some of my own jquery working
[17:32:09] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood want a link to the page?
[17:32:14] <DanAKAHollywood> Yes pleae
[17:32:16] <DanAKAHollywood> please*
[17:32:19] <cooki3s> systemfault: what do you mean with the question? the link?
[17:32:22] <d4rklit3> DanAKAHollywood:  do u live in hollywood
[17:32:29] <d4rklit3> or do ppl just call u that.. or did u just make that up
[17:32:37] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood http://95.146.94.58/stpeters2/heritage
[17:32:48] <cooki3s> systemfault: ohh sorry I get it. it will be different things, but for example: happy.gif
[17:32:48] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood clicking on an image should bring up a popup gallery
[17:32:49] <DanAKAHollywood> d4rklit3: It was a nicknamed pinned on me a couple of years ago by coworkers.
[17:32:56] <d4rklit3> but you don't live in los angeles?
[17:33:12] <systemfault> cooki3s: Could you explain what you want exactly? :(
[17:33:23] <DanAKAHollywood> d4rklit3: No, I do not.
[17:33:43] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: I'm going to switch to laptop right quick
[17:33:51] <cooki3s> systemfault: I want to replace all IMG SRC="mirror/happy.gif" with IMG SRC="sad.gif"
[17:34:02] <lenswipe> ok
[17:35:46] <systemfault> cooki3s: Ah then you could do something like: $('img[src=*"happy"]').each(... you can guess the rest
[17:36:22] <ngharo> lenswipe: class="poup" ?
[17:36:38] <cooki3s> systemfault: thanks alot, that teaches me a fair bit about the jquery regex, what does thte star mean tho?
[17:36:49] <lenswipe> ngharo ok i changed that - its still not working
[17:37:08] <systemfault> cooki3s: It's not regex
[17:37:14] <systemfault> cooki3s: It's CSS selectors
[17:37:34] <systemfault> cooki3s: That star means "contains"
[17:37:45] <cooki3s> systemfault: ah ok, thats awesome ty
[17:38:30] <lenswipe> ngharo i think i found the problem
[17:38:36] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood i found the problem
[17:38:47] <lenswipe> for some reason it doesnt like the jquery code that adds that in dynamically
[17:39:31] <ngharo> yes you'd have to call $.easy.popup() or whatever anytime you add crap
[17:40:21] <bambanx> hello
[17:40:29] <lenswipe> ngharo offs
[17:40:31] <lenswipe> ofc thanks
[17:40:31] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: You also have a bit more than that going on I believe.
[17:41:01] <lenswipe> thats it
[17:41:01] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: You have a few PHP errors happening as well.
[17:41:06] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood really?
[17:41:13] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood where?
[17:41:52] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: I can't even load the page on FF.
[17:41:58] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood really?

[17:42:26] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood holy shit it looks awful in firefox
[17:42:44] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Do you see all of the PHP errors?
[17:42:47] <lenswipe> nope
[17:43:04] <lenswipe> i just see a borked layout
[17:43:32] <DanAKAHollywood> I would upload a screenshot but they surpass the screen. It appears to be an eval problem in core/Loader.php though, line 5, 7, 8, etc.
[17:44:10] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood does it happen when you try and visit a page that doesnt exist?
[17:44:16] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood if so, i know about that
[17:44:19] <DanAKAHollywood> No, just the index page there.
[17:44:25] <lenswipe> so just /home ?
[17:44:30] <lenswipe> strange....im not seeing any of that
[17:44:45] <DanAKAHollywood> Ah, turns out I can't type.

[17:55:24] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: I have never heard of that, unless I am suppose to change that text altTxt
[17:56:00] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Add border-radius also.
[17:56:16] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: That will make them rounded for Opera as well.
[17:56:26] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood ok

[17:57:36] <lenswipe> ah lol
[17:57:41] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: you got issues.  have you looked at your source?
[17:57:42] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood thats webkit same as chrome
[17:57:49] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood im 99% sure it will be fine
[17:57:49] <ngharo> you have multiple <html> etc
[17:57:53] <ngharo> it's pretty nasty
[17:58:53] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: i cant help you because your markup makes everything i know unpredictable
[17:59:06] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Just has a different JavaScript engine.
[17:59:07] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: it is Drupal 7 and Views that I am using
[17:59:22] <lenswipe> hmm
[17:59:40] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Looks good.
[18:01:11] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: like i said, nothing will work as designed unless you fix those major issues.
[18:01:55] <cooki3s> systemfault: I recieve "missing ) after argument" error from this line: 	$('img[src=*"/images/post/b.png"]').each(function(i){ any ideas? :/
[18:02:37] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: oh everything has to be static?
[18:04:06] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: as a hack you could try chaning the hover selector from $('.field-selector .photo') to just $('.photo')
[18:04:14] <systemfault> cooki3s: $('img[src*="b.png"]').each(function(index, element){ do something with element });
[18:04:48] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: but seriously man for the love of mankind - please fix your views so you dont have two <html> docs in a page
[18:05:10] <ShawnRisk> I will fix that for sure
[18:05:14] <systemfault> cooki3s: It's *= and not =* (I don't know if it was me who did the type before)
[18:05:17] <systemfault> *typo

[18:09:00] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: Logged in, says it will redirect, but not doing so.
[18:09:01] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: I think that worked.  Now how do I hide this on load of page?  I am trying to fix the double header tags.
[18:09:11] <lenswipe> DanAKAHollywood yeah it doesnt, i havent implemented that yet
[18:09:22] <DanAKAHollywood> lenswipe: PM

[18:11:04] <ngharo> css*
[18:11:47] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: yep.  Last question:  How do I put the 1 and 2 within the slider?
[18:12:39] <rosieres_> Serious question :  My new window is filled with content. But it¥s only visible in Firerbug...  http://jsfiddle.net/2MQD5/13/   also @ superjacaman
[18:12:53] <ngharo> ShawnRisk: im not sure i understand
[18:13:37] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: you see the 1 and 2 that change between the images and you click them to switch images?  How do I put that on the slider under the alt text?
[18:14:22] <daleharvey> anyone use jquerymobile?

[18:25:32] <rosieres_> would anybody help me out with this ??  http://jsfiddle.net/2MQD5/13/ - If Button is hit a new window pops up. It seems to be empty but when you open the firebug the content i want to put there is in place . .  but invisible . . . has anybody an idea why ?
[18:25:54] <ngharo> i see it in chrome
[18:27:50] <rosieres_> ngharo: thx . . !! just opened it in opera . .  i see it there also ... but not in FF4 on Linux , , ,
[18:28:26] <ngharo> weird
[18:28:40] * ngharo is in ChromeOS
[18:28:54] <rosieres_> what kinda os are u running ?
[18:29:06] <systemfault> ngharo: Do you like it?
[18:29:06] <rosieres_> ahh k
[18:29:23] <ngharo> its not bad
[18:29:46] <ngharo> i spend 99% of my time in ssh and a browser anyways
[18:29:56] <ngharo> so for me, it works
[18:30:08] <systemfault> Haha, so it would work for me too
[18:30:18] <systemfault> Perhaps I'd install another distro though..
[18:30:25] <systemfault> I must try it first.
[18:32:26] <ngharo> there are live usb images somewhere on hexxeh.net
[18:35:18] <m0dmd> sup errbody!!
[18:35:31] <Anitox> wrd
[18:36:29] <m0dmd> :)
[18:37:01] <systemfault> ngharo: The way I see it, it's only good for small slow netbook-like devices, right?
[18:38:44] <ngharo> it's lightweight if that's what you're asking
[18:39:27] <systemfault> I mean, it looks like they put chrome as the shell and that's it.
[18:39:51] <systemfault> No classical desktop environment
[18:40:05] <ngharo> yes indeed
[18:44:48] <fris> anyone know if google is going to start hosting a cdn version of jquery mobile any time soon?
[18:45:14] <daleharvey> asked in jquerymobile but nobody around
[18:45:23] <tbranyen> wat
[18:46:28] <daleharvey> anyone know how to call a function on $.mobile.changePage, preferably it could block the page transition until its finished (fetching ajax data)
[18:47:15] <coldhead> fris don't see that happening until jqm gets out of alpha/beta
[18:47:19] <coldhead> which good luck with that, bro
[18:47:56] <rosieres_> OK .. got a new version that seems to work . . . exept in IE8  .. . If clone() and append() is run it throws an error like: "Error on Page - Interface not supported . . . jquery-1.6.js  " any ideas ?   http://jsfiddle.net/2MQD5/19/
[18:51:59] <Anitox> does the same thing for me in IE8 and Firefox 4
[18:54:03] <rosieres_> Anitox ?? Works or not ?
[19:03:25] <rosieres_> ok i found out that this what i want in not really possible at the moment. has anybody an idea how to toggle all containers to  display none exept my parent node ?
[19:03:39] <ngharo> rosieres_: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/2MQD5/20/ this work?
[19:04:57] <rosieres_> useless setTimeout call (missing quotes around argument?)
[19:04:57] <rosieres_> http://fiddle.jshell.net/ngharo/2MQD5/20/show/
[19:04:57] <rosieres_> Line 23
[19:06:03] <ngharo> huh
[19:06:26] <rosieres_> ngharo doesn¥t war in ie9 8 7 && FF4 on Linux . . .
[19:06:27] <ngharo> apply returns the function
[19:06:36] <ngharo> oh bummer
[19:06:42] <ngharo> once again, works in chrome
[19:07:58] <ngharo> i recall using window.opener for something at work long ago
[19:08:15] <ngharo> and it working on ie and ff for sure
[19:08:22] <rosieres_> ngharo: never mind . . . it won¥t work . . .  anything you do ;-)   as it¥s an wontfix bug . . .
[19:08:31] <rosieres_> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4059
[19:09:56] <rosieres_> so my only chance is to toggle all other containers to display:none and make my parent node only visible . . . any ideas for that ?
[19:11:38] <ngharo> to mimic a popup?
[19:11:48] <ngharo> y
[19:13:09] <rosieres_> it¥s for printing purposes within a Lifecycle Visualization Tool ....
[19:13:45] <ngharo> of course
[19:15:06] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: still there?
[19:15:29] <ngharo> beep
[19:15:34] <ShawnRisk> :)
[19:15:57] <ShawnRisk> just wanted to know if problems come ahead.  I just want to know if you would know how to change the numbers to images?
[19:19:07] <ngharo> i can graph numbers on my ti-86
[19:19:14] <ngharo> and print out an image
[19:19:15] <ShawnRisk> :)
[19:19:23] <ShawnRisk> I mean for the page I am doing
[19:21:41] <ngharo> select the collection of "numbers"
[19:21:54] <ngharo> loop over them using .each()
[19:22:25] <ngharo> and grab their .text() similar to how we were getting alttxt via .attr()
[19:22:54] <ngharo> umm
[19:23:26] <ShawnRisk> okay I get it
[19:23:49] <ngharo> yu could then append() an image with the number
[19:24:14] <ShawnRisk> last last last question:  How do I do the display:none, I tried this with the .css("display", "inline") but that didn't work out.  If that is the correct code I am not sure where to put this.
[19:25:18] <ngharo> set it in your stylesheet brah
[19:27:10] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: oh I will do that
[19:28:08] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: but if I do that the whole cover goes away that is why I want to try to use css
[19:28:45] <ngharo> ?show
[19:28:46] <bot-t> .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[19:28:57] <ngharo> ?hide
[19:28:57] <bot-t> .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[19:34:15] <cooki3s> I am using Greasemonkey to restyle a website. This website begins with white background, and I later restyle it with jquery to use a new stylesheet that switches background to black. The problem is that when I go to the website background goes from white to black, what would be your solution to this please?
[19:40:17] <ShawnRisk> okay
[19:43:09] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: thanks
[19:45:47] <youssif> come watch me get wet  http://bit.ly/liutDC
[19:47:43] <gavin_huang> I got a strange problem. hope someone will help me. thanks. i have a DOM element that fires two events a and b, it's possible that only one of them fires, or both of them fire, in latter case, b is always fired after a. so how should I register event listeners so that i can know how events are fired (i.e., if only one of them fires or both are fired)?
[19:50:55] <djQuery> gavin_huang: do a console.log of the event
[19:51:40] <gavin_huang> djQuery, thanks. but it's not a debugging process. i want to be able to do that in my program.
[19:52:32] <abjorn> http://twitter.com/#!/shock7c this guy is legit right? totally not a spam bot for skin care products rite?
[19:52:38] <rosieres_> ngharo . . .  even runs in IE7 ;-) http://jsfiddle.net/2MQD5/22/
[19:55:29] <djQuery> gavin_huang: then attach a to it after you attach b
[19:55:59] <djQuery> and it depends on what event you are binding to
[19:57:19] <gavin_huang> djQuery, what if only b is fired? how event listener for b knows if a is fired?
[20:06:05] <djQuery> gavin_huang: why not tell us what u are actualy tryin to accomplish?
[20:06:15] <djQuery> why not have just b and have b do both?
[20:07:46] <gavin_huang> djQuery, if only a is fired, then b does nothing.
[20:08:34] <gavin_huang> djQuery, well it's a little complicated. let me try to describe my use case..
[20:09:26] <djQuery> but u said that you wanted b to fire first any way. how is b gonna know about something that happens after it is done?
[20:09:56] <djQuery> function a(event){ #(this).trigger(b);
[20:10:56] <felo> coldhead need a hand
[20:11:50] <gavin_huang> djQuery, I didn't want b to fire first, I have no control over the order of their firings. All I know is either a fires or b fires or b fires afters a. that's all.
[20:12:23] <gavin_huang> *after
[20:12:25] <djQuery> gavin_huang: yes you do have control over how they are firing. the last one to be attached to the event fires first
[20:12:48] <djQuery> what event are each attached to?
[20:13:13] <gavin_huang> djQuery, they are different events, which is attached first makes no different.
[20:13:24] <gavin_huang> *difference
[20:13:33] <djQuery> gavin_huang: well have fun then. later
[20:14:24] <coldhead> ?p @ felo
[20:14:24] <bot-t> felo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[20:15:04] <cooki3s> simple question.. how can I set background color style of TABLE element before loading the DOM?
[20:15:25] <djQuery> cooki3s: with css
[20:16:11] <cooki3s> djQuery: I don't have access to it, so I am wondering if I can do it with jQuery.
[20:16:52] <djQuery> cooki3s: if you have access enough to it to add a reference to jquery you should have enough to add some css
[20:17:25] <cooki3s> djQuery: no.. I am using Greasemonkey, therefore I don'
[20:17:51] <felo> coldhead: please can you check at this one http://paste.pocoo.org/show/396510/ please I want to know if jquery goes back to the server or to the html?
[20:18:28] <djQuery> then just dont put it instide a $(docuemnt).ready()  just do $('table').css('asdf', 'whatever');
[20:18:51] <djQuery> seeing as how ur grease monkey always fires after the page you should be good
[20:19:22] <coldhead> felo: you don't seem to be sending anything to the server -- that would be post() or ajax()
[20:20:31] <felo> coldhead in this case when using jquery the action in the form will always be action="" empty in other words? and the variable will be always be passed by the jquery?
[20:20:49] <felo> instead of through the form action?
[20:21:09] <felo> i wan to get that right in my head so I never even think about touch ing the form action when using jquery
[20:21:21] <coldhead> ajax doesn't care what the action= is
[20:21:32] <coldhead> you tell ajax where to send the data
[20:21:45] <coldhead> .ajax('someurlhere', ...
[20:22:00] <felo> will it be to the html or to the server?
[20:22:02] <coldhead> and you CAN use the action to give you a URL but you don't HAVE to
[20:22:04] <felo> can be either or
[20:22:24] <coldhead> ajax goes to the server
[20:22:29] <felo> yesssssssssssssssssssss
[20:22:36] <felo> I need to know that little thing
[20:22:45] <coldhead> you should read the documentation
[20:22:49] <coldhead> it explains it better than i do
[20:22:52] <coldhead> and it has examples
[20:22:54] <felo> not man
[20:22:56] <coldhead> ?ajax
[20:22:56] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:24:26] <felo> i will come later with some stuff.
[20:25:02] <felo> so it means this code its grabbing the html data but is not sending it to server after that
[20:25:15] <coldhead> yes felo
[20:25:19] <coldhead> that's how it seems
[20:25:26] <felo> yesss
[20:25:38] <felo> Jquery I will kick your head
[20:25:39] <ngharo> yep
[20:26:09] <felo> jquery seems to be eiser and a lot more fun that php
[20:26:19] <coldhead> oh yes, very much so
[20:26:52] <felo> ok
[20:27:36] <felo> ngaharo: hey body
[20:28:57] <ngharo> only my mother calls me that
[20:29:12] <felo> Where the frick are you from
[20:29:43] <ngharo> internets
[20:29:56] <felo> up in here people call themselve body. I don't confuse me as your mother I am mr. Jquery kicker
[20:30:06] <felo> anyway I am going to get my hands dirty
[20:30:25] <ngharo> lol ok
[20:30:26] <felo> see ya later
[20:31:21] <ngharo> later body

[20:43:54] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: one question, I changed the numbers to images, and now need to add them to the slider and not as easy.
[20:44:48] <ShawnRisk> after this is done, I am done forever
[20:48:06] <felo> kicking buts here I have a question here success: function(msg){      alert( "Data Saved: " + msg );    } in this case what the msg is an argumennt and it can be any value right also, can that come from html ?
[20:49:21] <coldhead> that will be whatever the server returned
[20:49:39] <coldhead> and jquery will try to work out what format it is in and maybe process it a little for you
[20:49:49] <coldhead> but if it's just html then it should just be an html string
[20:50:13] <ShawnRisk> ngharo: still there or in bed?
[20:50:20] <coldhead> what you have there makes it look like it's a plain text string
[20:50:38] <snover> you look like a plain text string
[20:51:09] <coldhead> why thank you
[20:51:21] <coldhead> a plain text string with beautiful flowing golden hair, right?
[20:51:40] <coldhead> i use the 2nd least expensive shampoo
[20:52:01] <snover> frugal but not stingy
[20:52:04] <djQuery> and a pink dress
[20:52:27] <coldhead> it's apricot
[20:52:34] <coldhead> pink is for whores
[20:53:45] <coldhead> how rude, djQuery
[20:53:49] <coldhead> :)
[20:54:04] <psilo2> finally I feel like this channel is speaking my language
[20:55:28] <cooki3s> how do i select the first table element with css selector?
[20:55:56] <djQuery> table:first    but it dont work in all browsers
[20:56:38] <cooki3s> thx
[20:58:32] <snover> er, yes it does
[20:58:36] <snover> it‚Äôs just horribly slow

[20:59:19] <felo> abjorn?
[20:59:25] <abjorn> allo
[20:59:28] <felo> we are getting some romanticism here
[21:00:01] <coldhead> i am getting some coffee here
[21:00:09] <coldhead> and listening to the new battles again again again
[21:00:40] <felo> My wife is robbing my feets feels so good while I learn some jquery

[21:02:05] <felo> lol, it just happen yes
[21:02:07] <felo> lol
[21:02:11] <coldhead> i think i prefer new battles to having my feet robbed but that's just me
[21:02:21] <abjorn> i wish I had a lady to rob my feet
[21:02:23] <felo> well I have to say it just happen once in a year
[21:02:57] <felo> Well abjorn don't be dreaming that just happen 1 in a year
[21:03:57] <psilo2> a foot massage is nothing to sneeze at, gentlemen
[21:04:11] <ShawnRisk> I am so confused
[21:04:24] <abjorn> i could use a foot massage
[21:04:36] <psilo2> marriage on the other hand.. this man deserves our sympathy, let's be honorably polite.
[21:05:06] <felo> ufff I forgot I was talking out int he public
[21:05:42] <psilo2> also considering IRC put in public, further sympathy
[21:05:48] <psilo2> out*
[21:07:00] <felo> i have a out of the topic question if I send replyCommentid that cock variable coming from a input hidden field should I specify the dataType here?   $.ajax({       url: "profile.php",       global: false,       type: "POST",       data: ({replyCommentId : this.getAttribute('commentid')}),       dataType: "html",       async:false,           }
[21:07:08] <felo> dataType here is html
[21:07:32] <felo> What is the datatype anyways
[21:07:41] <felo> for
[21:07:41] <coldhead> it will probably work if you don't specify
[21:07:47] <felo> yessssssssssssss
[21:07:56] <coldhead> there are some cases where it breaks unless you specify
[21:08:05] <coldhead> but keep it simple if you can
[21:08:09] <coldhead> let jquery worry about that shit
[21:08:18] <felo> because the dataType means where is going to send the information to or where is getting it from?
[21:08:30] <felo> hahaha
[21:08:34] <coldhead> it explains it in the docs i linked you to earlier
[21:08:39] <felo> darn i will get that Cock out
[21:09:31] <abjorn> what
[21:10:09] <coldhead> pretty sure it's better not knowing, abjorn
[21:10:19] <abjorn> yeah im inclined to agree
[21:10:25] <felo> Yes it can get confusing abjorn
[21:11:25] <felo> what about that data: shit let me see if I understand this nonsense replyCommentId will get the value of comemntid
[21:11:35] <felo> Shit what simple complicated thing here
[21:12:52] <felo> and then it will send it type POST, not Global and it will send it in the profile.php url Fuck this shit is simple
[21:13:20] <felo> jquery is getting me crazy.... folks
[21:18:37] <snover> felo: I am pretty sure that process started long before jquery.
[21:18:46] <coldhead> lol
[21:19:13] <abjorn> I think you should be in this mental institution (I'm watching One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest)
[21:19:14] <felo> yes I can tell you it started in php my brother. and probably maybe even a little before
[21:19:28] <snover> it‚Äôs funny because of my deadpan delivery. and also because nobody can understand what you write
[21:19:49] <abjorn> really cause C++ is what threw me over the edge
[21:19:55] <felo> snover this shit is not easy.
[21:20:07] <felo> i get like that whenever I am learning a new language
[21:20:22] <felo> you needed to see me when I was learning php
[21:20:23] <felo> shit
[21:20:28] <felo> That shit was crazy bro
[21:20:31] <snover> I‚Äôm pretty sure that is the last thing I need
[21:20:32] <abjorn> C++ will drive you mad whether you're just learning it or not
[21:20:56] <felo> well we all a bunch of fucking nuts
[21:23:24] <coldhead> omnomnomnom guinness
[21:23:29] <abjorn> meh
[21:23:34] <abjorn> hate beer
[21:23:39] <felo> Still empty big time this bitchy id
[21:23:42] <iszak> +1
[21:23:46] <coldhead> you are the worst texan in history
[21:23:51] <abjorn> I really am lol
[21:23:55] <felo> I will have to put the id manually
[21:23:57] <abjorn> well nah
[21:24:03] <iszak> well Guinness is Irish..
[21:24:05] <abjorn> my love for barbeque makes up for it coldhead
[21:24:13] <felo> everytime this guide post a response to a fucking commment
[21:24:38] <snover> I think it‚Äôs time for everyone in here working on whatever they are working on right now to just give up
[21:24:49] <iszak> giving up is for the weak.
[21:24:50] <coldhead> ki thought barbeque was an excuse for beer, not an ends to itself
[21:25:10] <coldhead> no i'm with snover
[21:25:20] <coldhead> everyone should just let facebook do whatever they were trying to do for them
[21:25:34] <iszak> take over the world?
[21:25:37] <snover> coldhead, stop regressing
[21:26:18] <iszak> ??
[21:26:33] <iszak> coldhead, how's Clojure going?
[21:26:52] <felo> what is clojure?
[21:27:10] <snover> ?lmgtfy clojure @ felo
[21:27:10] <bot-t> felo, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=clojure
[21:27:20] <abjorn> lisp dialect built on java
[21:27:22] <abjorn> i think
[21:27:24] <abjorn> or something like that
[21:27:27] <abjorn> it's a lisp dialect
[21:27:59] <iszak> something like that.
[21:28:10] <coldhead> a little slowly lately, iszak , but there's a nice puzzle site at 4clojure.com
[21:28:40] <iszak> coldhead, you haven't been investing time into ruby instead have you?
[21:28:49] <coldhead> :(
[21:28:59] <snover> OH MY GOD SPEAKING OF PUZZLES DO YOU GUYS HAVE THE HEIST I HEARD IT WAS THE #1 APP STORE APP OMG
[21:29:09] <iszak> who cares.
[21:29:40] <snover> Apparently lots of people because IT IS #1 IN THE APP STORE
[21:29:45] <snover> SO THERE
[21:29:50] <snover> ?iszak
[21:29:50] <bot-t> http://bit.ly/9ssjmq
[21:29:54] <iszak> only macfags care.
[21:29:58] <iszak> androidfags don't.
[21:30:11] <djQuery> yeah and a lotta idiots whatch dancin with the stars too
[21:30:12] <iszak> Can I get it on my android?
[21:30:18] <djQuery> whata ur point
[21:30:19] <snover> NUMBER ONE
[21:30:28] <snover> AND IT‚ÄôS ONLY 99 CENTS WHAT A DEAL
[21:30:44] <iszak> of which they get like 70% of it?
[21:30:56] <iszak> 0.693 cents to the developer! yay
[21:31:01] <iszak> I mean 0.693 dollars
[21:31:10] <snover> you must work for verizon
[21:31:13] <coldhead> what position did you say it held on the app store?
[21:31:24] <iszak> NUMBA ONE
[21:31:30] <snover> DAS RITE
[21:31:32] <coldhead> oic
[21:31:36] <coldhead> thanks
[21:31:40] <snover> BETTER THAN ANGRY BIRDS
[21:31:50] <snover> BETTER THAN EVERYTHING EVER
[21:31:58] <coldhead> it sounds like i'd better get an iphone or 2
[21:32:04] <snover> get 3 and share!
[21:32:11] <coldhead> don't tell anyone i just came to the party
[21:32:22] <iszak> snover, angry birds has been at number 1 longer than the heist and therefore it's > the heist.
[21:32:48] <coldhead> it doesn't sound as modern as the heist
[21:32:51] <coldhead> whatever it is
[21:32:53] <snover> iszak stop bringing the fourth dimension into this
[21:33:04] <iszak> coldhead, so how's ruby going then?
[21:33:14] <cooki3s> Anyone know whats wrong with this line? 	$(this).replaceWith('<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="994" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: none;">' + $(this).html(); + '</table>'); it works fine if I switch html to text...
[21:33:17] <coldhead> not too annoyingly
[21:33:19] <iszak> snover, why?
[21:33:25] <snover> cooki3s: lots and lots
[21:33:46] <iszak> coldhead, become a ruby programmer then?
[21:33:58] <snover> iszak: because what has the fourth dimension ever done for me lately
[21:34:05] <cooki3s> snover: and what is that? I wasn't asking how much was wrong with it.
[21:34:16] <coldhead> iszak: i think i'd rather just be a programmer
[21:34:23] <snover> basically everything starting with ' and continuing on to the end of it
[21:34:49] <iszak> snover, it made you late or early or on time for work
[21:35:14] <coldhead> cooki3s: the way you say it works without the html() bit makes it sound like some of the problem is in there
[21:35:38] <cooki3s> coldhead: yeah, I have no idea what the problem could be though :/
[21:35:51] <snover> iszak: but it can‚Äôt make me yesterday for work, which is why it‚Äôs on notice.
[21:36:08] <iszak> I don't see why it couldn't.
[21:36:27] <snover> because no matter what I do, I can‚Äôt get it to go backwards
[21:36:31] <coldhead> cooki3s: did you try console.log()ing the html() bit to see if it's fucked up somehow?
[21:37:18] <iszak> snover, I cba arguing with you, I'm sick.
[21:39:05] <cooki3s> coldhead: do you mean writing var e = $(this).html(); console.log(e); ? it didnt output anything in the console for me :s
[21:39:21] <ngharo> cooki3s: if $(this) is already a table, why not just modify its properties to your liking
[21:39:38] <coldhead> that is more or less what i meant
[21:39:50] <coldhead> sorry cooki3s, i'm still very new at jQuery
[21:39:57] <cooki3s> coldhead: ok me too :p
[21:40:10] <ngharo> coldhead: i gotta start using that one
[21:40:24] <coldhead> maybe you should pastebin all the code, cooki3s ?
[21:42:01] <cooki3s> ngharo: what I'm trying to do is .hide() the table before DOM is loaded, I just need to keep the content of table through the replaceWith();
[21:43:08] <iszak> ughhhhh
[21:43:37] <cooki3s> coldhead: http://pastebin.com/z3D0fU7x
[21:47:09] <ngharo> cooki3s: you cant select an element until its in the DOM afaik
[21:47:42] <cooki3s> ngharo: its working fine though with .text as I said
[21:47:48] <coldhead> i have a lot of questions about this code
[21:47:55] <coldhead> like why are you using each with :first ?
[21:48:06] <coldhead> shouldn't :first just give you one thing?
[21:48:35] <snover> [width="994"] this house of cards is certainly not very strong
[21:48:39] <cooki3s> aye, I'm just not sure how to write it without the .each so I just kept it, figured it shouldn't matter
[21:48:39] <coldhead> and can't you just give the table a class, rather than selecting it via its with? that looks fragile
[21:49:16] <ngharo> and why not just call hide() like you stated "what I'm trying to do is .hide()"
[21:49:37] <cooki3s> why does it matter? its not the real issue guys :s or would this at all be linked to .html not working when .text is?
[21:49:56] <cooki3s> ngharo: because when i use .show on it after DOM is loaded, it doesn't show
[21:49:57] <ngharo> it does matter when you're going about something totally wrong
[21:50:35] <coldhead> i think it matters because you want things to break in the simplest way possible, rather than in a complex way
[21:51:26] <ngharo> cooki3s: so why not focus on that problem instead of doing this obscure ugly hack thats not working
[21:55:28] <coldhead> cooki3s: can you paste the html AND the JS on jsfiddle and we'll try to fix it in every possibe way?
[21:56:59] <cooki3s> sorry guys, I just dont want to waste more of anyones time than nessecary, so I try to keep it simple - I have asked questions before that were more obvious like the .hide thing but then no one answered so I moved on to try other paths
[21:57:48] <coldhead> if you wanna try again from the basics, i'm game
[21:58:05] <coldhead> also increasingly drunk, so i guess there is a time limit on that offer
[21:59:08] <snover> you can transition naturally from code to heavy petting
[22:00:50] <coldhead> i wish, i have terrible onion breath
[22:01:48] <coldhead> i think tedx is a cult
[22:02:28] <snover> i think i agree
[22:16:11] <stringa> Hello...is there a good mobile framework for Windows Mobile?
[22:16:24] <mipo> hi
[22:16:31] <stringa> hello
[22:16:50] <mipo> how to make menu and sub menu with jquery without any id
[22:17:05] <mipo> this is my code , generated by php code
[22:17:18] <mipo> I want to make that menu for user
[22:17:22] <mipo> http://pastie.org/1983653
[22:18:03] <stringa> I don't know, i would have to look at docs
[22:18:20] <mipo> :(
[22:19:41] <stringa> a menu is a broad term
[22:19:45] <stringa> what kind of menu
[22:19:50] <stringa> u using plugins?
[22:19:53] <stringa> rolling your own?
[22:19:54] <mipo> no
[22:20:20] <stringa> you can create a hoverable menu with just CSS
[22:20:32] <stringa> with a submenu
[22:20:46] <mipo> don need jquery?
[22:21:10] <stringa> I'm sure there are plugin's for that
[22:21:15] <stringa> if you wanna use JS to run your menu
[22:21:34] <stringa> or you can use styles, use the :hover state's
[22:21:47] <stringa> basically, you create the normal style
[22:21:51] <stringa> and the :hover state
[22:22:10] <stringa> and bam....you have a menu with 100% css
[22:23:03] <stringa> your original question doesn't make much sense to me
[22:23:10] <stringa> maybe cause I'm new to web
[22:23:14] <stringa> and new to jquery
[22:23:15] <mipo> but with css , is not unlimited
[22:23:25] <stringa> it's not unlimited
[22:23:35] <stringa> unlimited in what fashion?
[22:24:00] <mipo> I want unlimied , cause my php code generated unlimited menu
[22:24:03] <stringa> you can use jQuery templates, or just plain javascript if you need dynamic menu's
[22:24:23] <mipo> how?
[22:24:24] <stringa> CSS creates your "states"
[22:24:34] <stringa> you still write out your menu with PHP
[22:24:48] <stringa> CSS will give your the "visual" effects your looking for
[22:25:03] <stringa> you can use Javascript and with it in your "ready" event
[22:25:11] <stringa> there are infinate possibilities
[22:25:18] <mipo> ok
[22:25:27] <mipo> This is have long time
[22:25:28] <mipo> ;)
[22:25:37] <mipo> I wanna effect!
[22:26:29] <Valantine> hi
[22:26:40] <Valantine> is there any sureshot way to select a value in select box? as to me sometimes the $("select").val(value); fails and resets the select box to the first value. I am using jquery 1.6.1 and php ver 5.3.6
[22:27:32] <stringa> php has nothing todo with your jQuery problems
[22:28:05] <mipo> Valantine, can you give me some code?
[22:28:32] <mipo> stringa, my php code is connected to database and generating
[22:29:06] <mipo> Valantine, your option tag have value attribute?
[22:33:34] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[22:48:52] <abjorn> slow night

[22:55:40] <dr0id> yes
[22:55:40] <abjorn> cause it likes to do that on linux
[22:55:55] <dr0id> didn't do before the computer crashed (on an older version of the distro)
[22:55:58] <abjorn> skype support on linux is shit, they hardly pay attention to it. It's very beta
[22:56:11] <dr0id> I am ok with it :) plain and simple, heh.
[22:56:11] <abjorn> and now that skype is all microsoft im sure thats just gonna get worse
[22:57:33] <abjorn> man I can't wait for node to have proper windows support <3
[22:57:42] <abjorn> tired of doing all my node testing through vbox
[23:17:09] <domino14> i have the following:
[23:17:13] <domino14> $.post(tableUrl, {action: "savePrefs", prefs: {'tc': {on: true}} }, ‚Ä¶ )
[23:17:56] <domino14> it seems to post it as action savePrefs   prefs[tc][on] true
[23:18:35] <domino14> how come it encodes it as prefs[tc][on] ? is this part of the jquery post behavior ?
