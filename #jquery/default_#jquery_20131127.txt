[00:13:20] <ButtDog> Is it possible to have this function fire on a button click instead of automatically start uploading upon file selection? https://dpaste.de/Yzdq
[00:14:01] <libin> hi.. I am making a server request via ajax, and the server returns a json, which i can see in the network tab, i have checked that json, and it is a valid json too, but i am getting syntax error in my script.. any hints
[00:22:54] <libin> is anyone in here
[00:26:39] <Cork> ?ask
[00:26:39] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:29:22] <grafi> yeah Cork just ask :P
[00:31:52] <Cork> Cork, grafi: sure thing ;P
[00:50:25] <TN1982> sup guys, i got a soap getting the BIC code from a bankaccount. I would really like it to be autocompleted upon entering the bankaccount in the input. How do i go about this with soap and xml? this is what i've got: http://pastebin.com/L46BMN1m
[00:51:47] <TN1982> Works with my php but can't get the jquery to work
[01:15:11] <joroci> anyone here?
[01:15:29] <Cork> ?ask @ joroci
[01:15:29] <b-ot> joroci: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:15:35] <libin> i did ask couple of times, but there was no reply.. hence i asked if anyone in here.. but i managed to get it corrected.. thanks anyways
[01:15:45] <joroci> yea i asked because i have connection issues
[01:17:03] <Cork> repeating the question comes with the territory when you ask in irc
[01:18:44] <joroci> i have couple of links, each one makes an ajax request to get a preview, the problem is when i click multiple times i get too many previews in the container
[01:19:35] <Cork> joroci: so either prevent them from happening if you have an active query
[01:19:45] <Cork> or abort the old one when a new one happens
[01:19:54] <joroci> how can i abort?
[01:20:23] <Cork> xhr.abort()
[01:20:32] <joroci> using jquery?
[01:20:41] <Cork> or just native js
[01:21:08] <Cork> xhr is the reference to the XmlHttpRequest object
[01:21:22] <Cork> you get it from $.ajax and the like
[01:23:01] <joroci> thanks
[01:25:59] <Lewix> I want to select items that are not checked and under a specifi element
[01:26:32] <Lewix> $("input:not(:checked)") to select items that are not checked
[01:26:48] <Lewix> How do i get more specific?
[01:27:01] <Cork> $(".parent-class-name input:not(:checked)")
[01:27:24] <Cork> or input.class-name:not(:checked)
[01:27:41] <Cork> or... it's css it works like any normal selector
[01:27:52] <Lewix> Cork: thanks a lot buddy
[01:29:53] <seutje> lies, it's magic!
[01:32:47] <Lewix> Cork: except it's not working
[01:33:15] <Cork> Lewix: what selector did you go with, and what are you trying to select?
[01:33:21] <TN1982> when i go to http://www.ibanbic.be/IBANBIC.asmx/BBANtoBIC?Value=360110719341  i get the right value i want, when i put that as the url in an autocomplete i get the value in firebug but no answer: http://pastebin.com/tAfpQuQ4
[01:33:23] <Lewix> Cork: $(".parent-class-name input:not(:checked)") is not working but let me gist to be more specific
[01:33:45] <Cork> Lewix: uh, do you have a parent-class-name class on a parent?
[01:37:28] <Lewix> Cork: so here is what i have http://jsfiddle.net/8xqt4/. I want to make it so that when i click on one of the three categories (main stuff,other stuff, or sort by) all the other boxes within the categories are uncheck. so my end goal is to be able to select three options max but only one in each category
[01:38:51] <Lewix> Cork: I started working on it with the following  $("input:not(:checked)").attr('disabled', 'disabled'); then I tried your suggestion - I appended a new class Categorie1 to the first categorie to test and tried $(".categorie1 input:not(:checked)").attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[01:39:24] <Lewix> note that $("input:not(:checked)").attr('disabled', 'disabled') worked but it wasn't what i wanted
[01:41:33] <SuperTyp> will this work? var bool = false; alert(bool.value);
[01:42:27] <SuperTyp> okay it won't
[01:42:49] <SuperTyp> how can I output the value of a boolean? alert/console.log
[01:43:08] <Cork> SuperTyp: no
[01:43:18] <Cork> SuperTyp: console.log(bool)
[01:43:36] <Cork> alert won't work though
[01:43:44] <SuperTyp> sigh, thx
[01:43:45] <Cork> it needs it to be converted to a string
[01:43:55] <Cork> alert(JSON.stringify(bool))
[01:44:27] <Lewix> alert(parse(bool))?
[01:44:42] <Cork> no
[01:44:47] <Cork> parse isn't a function
[01:47:08] <SuperTyp> why does the if not work?
[01:47:09] <SuperTyp> http://pastebin.com/LkfvHgvE
[01:47:36] <Cork> SuperTyp: it hsould work just fine
[01:47:49] <Cork> though the if in line 12 would by false as you set it to that one line 1
[01:47:56] <Cork> by==be
[01:48:28] <Cork> SuperTyp: the event callback in click doesn't trigger ready to run again
[01:50:32] <SuperTyp> well that is why I console.log(enteredbool)
[01:50:38] <SuperTyp> and it says it is true
[01:50:43] <Cork> sure
[01:50:46] <SuperTyp> so why the hack doesnt it go into the if
[01:50:51] <Cork> you set it to true the line before
[01:51:02] <Cork> SuperTyp: cause the if runs before you set it to true
[01:51:20] <Cork> flow is: 1. you set it to false
[01:51:25] <Cork> 2. you bind an event listener for ready
[01:51:34] <Cork> 3. ready fires
[01:51:41] <Cork> 4. you bind a click event listener
[01:51:47] <Cork> 5. you check if it is true
[01:51:59] <Cork> 6. you click and the click callback fires
[01:52:04] <Cork> 7. you set it to true
[01:52:10] <Cork> 8. you console.log the value
[01:54:33] <e01> how can i reset moved element to it's original position
[01:55:35] <e01> because my element is in some div that is position relative, i need it to append it to body, but then i need go back to it original position, with append to it's parent it will adding it after all elements
[01:56:33] <Cork> e01: if the element is moved it is moved
[01:56:42] <Cork> e01: you will have to move them back if you want to
[01:59:05] <SuperTyp> Cork: point 2. event listener for ready?
[01:59:15] <Cork> SuperTyp: line 3
[01:59:35] <SuperTyp> thats what I thought ok
[01:59:47] <Lewix> So we have onclick , Do we have something like onunclick
[01:59:51] <Lewix> lol serious question
[01:59:56] <Cork> <_<'
[01:59:57] <Cork> no
[02:00:07] <Cork> there is mouseup though
[02:00:08] <SuperTyp> isnt there mouseup mousedown?
[02:00:15] <Lewix> hmm i have to find a way around it
[02:00:16] <Cork> but it fires before click if i remember correctly
[02:00:39] <Cork> mousedown > mouseup > click
[02:01:04] <Lewix> when i check my box now the other in the categorie get disable , not i want to renable it if i uncked it
[02:01:35] <Cork> Lewix: so check $(this).prop('checked')
[02:01:50] <Cork> click is just for the act of clicking it, not checking
[02:02:25] <SuperTyp> callback means what should happen after I clicked?
[02:02:46] <Cork> SuperTyp: callback is the function() {} you pass to the function when you bind the even listener
[02:03:21] <Cork> (doesn't explicitly have to be function() {}, any function could be passed in)
[02:03:47] <SuperTyp> like line 4?
[02:04:01] <Cork> that is an example yes
[02:04:08] <Cork> line 3 is another
[02:04:38] <SuperTyp> ok
[02:04:41] <SuperTyp> thx
[02:09:18] <SuperTyp> Cork why point 5?
[02:09:32] <Cork> what do you mean why?
[02:09:59] <spaceninja> anyone knows a easy jquery plugin for parallax websites?
[02:11:23] <Cork> SuperTyp: point 5 is at point 5 cause it is the next line in the code
[02:15:52] <Bauer> hey Cork :) can you look at my .bind event here? https://cloud-dev.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm click VM (green), then 2008 - you can see that <div id="Silver> has a .click event listener (created by $('#Silver').bind('click', function() { PostFinalPlanSelection({Level:'Silver'}); }); ) - problem is, that it is not firing, I think because of the Flash Object... any workarounds you can
[02:15:52] <Bauer> suggest please?
[02:16:08] <Lewix> Cork: https://gist.github.com/6ewis/b70ca9363520704e8511
[02:16:19] <Lewix> what am I doin gwrong
[02:16:51] <Cork> Bauer: possibly, yes flash only lets click event through if the flash content actively do that
[02:17:14] <Cork> Lewix: this should not be in a string
[02:19:01] <Bauer> Cork: how? any other alternatives?
[02:19:32] <Cork> Bauer: you would put an element ontop of the element and catch the click through that i guess
[02:19:56] <Cork> (there is a reason why these things suck on the web :) )
[02:20:29] <Cork> canvas + video + svg FTW!
[02:21:07] <SuperTyp> hm Cork the 5. point is wrong there I think :\
[02:21:17] <Cork> SuperTyp: why?
[02:21:23] <SuperTyp> I fire click first and then I want to check if its true
[02:21:27] <Cork> no
[02:21:32] <Cork> you BIND the callback first
[02:21:40] <Cork> the code still runs on
[02:21:45] <Cork> and when you click the callback fires
[02:22:17] <SuperTyp> hm this means I am thinking wrong
[02:22:19] <Cork> SuperTyp: if you thought the code froze on line 4 until someone clicked something
[02:22:23] <Cork> it doesn't work like that
[02:22:29] <SuperTyp> okay thats the poin
[02:22:30] <SuperTyp> t
[02:22:49] <Cork> events are async
[02:23:01] <Cork> meaning they run the code out of order
[02:25:07] <Bauer> Cork: hehe well, could you tell me what to tell the guy who did the flash shits? we also tried playing with z-index: 5 on the div, and -1 to the Object, adn the click is still not going through
[02:25:53] <Cork> Bauer: no i just know that it is a known problem that flash can stop events from propagating
[02:26:08] <Cork> Bauer: and just absolute positioning a div over the flash should work
[02:26:12] <SuperTyp> Cork thats crazy
[02:26:31] <Cork> SuperTyp: no it is common and logical
[02:26:38] <Lewix> Cork: thanks but apparently there's something else. https://gist.github.com/6ewis/b70ca9363520704e8511. How would you approach it?
[02:26:54] <Lewix> -what I am trying to do overall
[02:27:22] <Bauer> Cork: how to absolute position a new div exactly over the existing div? please note, that the existing div ("Silver") is clickable, on a very tiny spot between the DEtails and the Flash :)
[02:27:49] <Cork> Bauer: there is many ways to do it
[02:27:57] <Cork> add a parent and let it wrap around the element
[02:28:17] <Cork> and absolute position the div in relation to that parent should prob be the simplest way
[02:28:44] <Cork> Bauer: fun facts about the event thing https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78414
[02:28:54] <Cork> it is kinda known and long problem :)
[02:31:10] <Cork> Bauer: btw, embed doens't have an end tag :)
[02:32:39] <Cork> Bauer: but honestly... why are you doing this with flash?
[02:33:38] <Cork> Bauer: another problem is i don't find any Silver in the code
[02:33:48] <SuperTyp> is this the right way? http://pastebin.com/5YxiJtqE
[02:34:22] <Lewix> thanks for your help. I spent a while on it and i didn't budge much, I'll try to do it in the am
[02:34:26] <Cork> SuperTyp: if you want the if check to happen before you change the value on each click; yes it is
[02:34:57] <Cork> Lewix: $('this') is still wrong...
[02:35:07] <Cork> $('this') => $(this)
[02:35:24] <seutje> attr('disabled' -> prop('disabled'
[02:35:26] <Cork> and checked should be a string...
[02:35:49] <Cork> well .attr('disabled', 'disabled') => .prop('disabled', true) even
[02:36:26] <seutje> gotta spell it all out? :(
[02:37:34] <Lewix> omg thanks
[02:37:49] <Cork> Lewix: http://jsfiddle.net/CQuHP/
[02:37:51] <Lewix> Cork: seems like ill go to sleep a bit late now i think i can actually finish this
[02:38:51] <Lewix> Cork: why did you change it Attr and removeAttr - it worked
[02:39:01] <Cork> Lewix: cause it is wrong
[02:39:08] <Cork> you want to change the prop
[02:39:13] <Cork> attr won't work in older ie
[02:39:30] <Lewix> Cork: ah ok - is that all?
[02:39:46] <Cork> i fixed the attr and the checked test
[02:41:41] <Lewix> Cork: anyways thanks now ill try to finish it before heading to bed. it shall take a while
[02:45:42] <SidGBF> How to strip all the javascript tags from a string before parsing it with jquery?
[02:47:01] <Lewix> SidGBF: can you be more specific?
[02:47:18] <Lewix> Cork: you are awesome, it took me 2s to do the rest lol
[02:48:02] <SidGBF> Lewix: Im working with node + jquery module. I made a request and got the whole html of the page. Now I need to find some things in the html. But when I try to do that, I get some sizzle errors...
[02:49:08] <Lewix> SidGBF: ok it's way above my head. im new with js.
[02:49:20] <SidGBF> Lewix: thanks anyway :)
[02:49:30] <Lewix> SidGBF: in ruby that would be easy pie
[02:49:32] <Lewix> =)
[02:49:45] <Lewix> Cork: https://gist.github.com/6ewis/b70ca9363520704e8511 how would you refactor it
[02:54:16] <Cork> SidGBF: something like var dom = $($.parseHTML(html)); dom.find('script').remove(); target.append(dom) should work
[02:54:36] <SidGBF> sounds legit :)
[02:54:41] <SidGBF> thanks :)
[03:06:28] <kenansulayman> Hi there
[03:06:39] <kenansulayman> I was sent here from #jqueryui
[03:07:00] <kenansulayman> Quick question; we're battling with a positioning issue and don't get to fix it
[03:07:07] <kenansulayman> It's a modded tooltip and works fine (http://data.sly.mn/Sfym) but we're facing some issues inside a frame
[03:07:18] <lennondtps> Good Evening, I am using the example of jquery json from the documentation http://jsfiddle.net/w44F7/ and trying to change the source from flickr to openclipart http://jsfiddle.net/Qud84/ but it doesn't parse the images :( any advice?
[03:07:23] <kenansulayman> The other fields are misaligned http://data.sly.mn/Sfv4; http://data.sly.mn/Sglk
[03:07:28] <kenansulayman> As positioning parameters we're using my: "left top+15", at: "left bottom", collision: "flipfit flip"
[03:07:28] <kenansulayman> Is there any technical implication here? We couldn't totally trace the issue back using the debugger; it seems jquery fails to determine the wrong coords
[03:08:34] <seutje> if it fails to determine the wrong coords, wouldn't it be positioned correctly? :P
[03:09:10] <kenansulayman> seutje true. bad sentence
[03:09:25] <seutje> kenansulayman: not much I can do based on screenshots
[03:09:35] <kenansulayman> mom
[03:12:11] <kenansulayman> seutje http://f.cl.ly/items/1L1G3T3u1N1p3N0J3G0g/test.html
[03:12:32] <kenansulayman> This is the PoC we've built of what we're integrating currently
[03:12:50] <coRz> hello everyone
[03:12:56] <kenansulayman> This is integrated into a fork of Etherpad
[03:13:48] <kenansulayman> And the html inside the editor itself is utterly deep nested (http://data.sly.mn/Sfyi/content/shot.html)
[03:15:00] <seutje> what the poop, it actually closes my chrome tab without any confirmation
[03:15:09] <kenansulayman> wat?
[03:15:26] <kenansulayman> I thought that was a bug in the recent safari 7.0.1 only
[03:16:01] <lennondtps> Good Evening, I am using the example of jquery json from the documentation http://jsfiddle.net/w44F7/ and trying to change the source from flickr to openclipart http://jsfiddle.net/Qud84/ but it doesn't parse the images :( any advice?
[03:16:59] <Bauer> Cork: sorry, was on break. Silver is only after you click the green VM, and the 2008 image
[03:17:54] <Bauer> Cork: why Embed do you refer to? that Silver div does not have any embed
[03:18:38] <ButtDog> I'm looking for quick help on a Django site. Trying to incorperate a JQuery fileuploader.
[03:19:09] <Cork> Bauer: are you binding the event listener after you have added the element?
[03:19:27] <Cork> Bauer: that might be the cause otherwise
[03:19:28] <kenansulayman> seutje it seems jquery fails to detect the right positioning of some elements inside a frame (we're actually going through 3 depths of frames here)
[03:19:44] <seutje> kenansulayman: when this line runs the second time, the tab just disappears: return typeof jQuery !== core_strundefined && (!e || jQuery.event.triggered !== e.type) ?jQuery.event.dispatch.apply( eventHandle.elem, arguments ) : undefined;
[03:19:49] <seutje> which is rather... odd
[03:20:06] <kenansulayman> And shouldn't happen (bug!)
[03:20:22] <kenansulayman> When I have the time I will report that to the webkit team
[03:20:28] <kenansulayman> but I have quite some pressure right now
[03:21:56] <lennondtps> Oh mistake! I provide the same  2 times! this one is the one that it doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/2n8ax/
[03:22:37] <seutje> kenansulayman: it doesn't seem to close the tab on chrome canary
[03:22:44] <seutje> and the positioning seems to be correct
[03:22:45] <kenansulayman> Indeed
[03:22:52] <kenansulayman> that's where the point is
[03:23:01] <kenansulayman> here is the _same_ code applied to our situation: http://local.sly.mn:82/p/g.PzQfScqrJqZjpK3M$f9833de6ce1b50fc2f867979375291af66ab445e683f060364d5b8dd1f7e9ff0c69bbf6cb883b436a7b6259dcdf0f555770db0d1abf84288cda7279f000b6d0e?showControls=true&showChat=false&showLineNumbers=false&useMonospaceFont=false&userName=Kenan%20Sulayman&noColors=false&userColor=false&hideQRCode=false&alwaysShowChat=true
[03:23:10] <kenansulayman> it's a staging server
[03:24:27] <kenansulayman> jquery fails to detect deep nested positions inside frames (at least to what I observed)
[03:25:41] <Bauer> Cork: according to w3: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_embed.asp embed shouldnt have a closing tag
[03:26:01] <Cork> Bauer: like i said :)
[03:26:20] <Bauer> Cork: we also noted strange thing: in FF it works (the click on the div of the flash, in IE it works if you double click - and only in Chrome it does not work at all
[03:26:45] <Bauer> ahh, I thought you meant we are missing some closing tag on embed :P
[03:26:56] <Cork> Bauer: doesn't surprise me
[03:27:19] <Cork> i quote: <embed wmode="transparent" src="https://www.ccc.co.il/App_Themes/Banner/Cloud/Store/vCloud.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="310px" height="334px" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed>
[03:28:10] <Bauer> Cork: why doesnt that surprise you? usually if things work in Chrome, they work in FF :)
[03:28:29] <Cork> Bauer: plugins is strap-on
[03:28:45] <Cork> so that things behave differently in different browsers doesn't surprise me
[03:30:13] <Bauer> Cork: so we are down to 3 options: 1) convert swf to GIF. 2) overlay DIV and 3) change click propagation setting in SWF ( how can we be sure it is the source of the problem?)
[03:30:45] <Cork> Bauer: i would start with hunting for a bug about plugins/flash in chromes/chromiums bug tracker
[03:31:07] <Cork> luckily it is open in contrast to ie's
[03:32:14] <Bauer> Cork: I have quite an experience with Chrome's bug tracker - I have some starred for 3+ years now, its not gonna be resolved soon enough even if I find the bug (or open new one) :P
[03:32:44] <Cork> Bauer: didn't mean that
[03:33:07] <Cork> but it is most likely good to confirm that it really is a bug in chrome and not just something you did wrong
[03:33:21] <Cork> and you might be able to find a reason/workaround
[03:33:25] <Cork> and that would help too
[03:33:42] <Cork> except for that, i would go with a cover div ya
[03:34:12] <walidvb> anyone knows of a jquery plugin that makes a website stereoscopic, ie adds red++blue text-shadow to all text, or smth similar?
[03:34:29] <Bauer> Cork: whats wrong with converting the sfw to flash?
[03:34:50] <Cork> walidvb: i don't see why you would need a plugin for that
[03:34:52] <Cork> it's just css
[03:35:13] <Cork> Bauer: swf IS flash...
[03:35:39] <Bauer> Cork: yes, which is why I think fastest would be to convert the flash files to gif
[03:35:46] <walidvb> Cork: true, but I figured someone might have made a plugin that would turn the whole page to 3d, with some fancier effects, such as putting some divs in front of others, according to some rules, or smth.
[03:35:55] <Cork> Bauer: " converting the sfw to flash?" :)
[03:36:02] <walidvb> process images maybe
[03:36:02] <Cork> Bauer: well sure
[03:36:12] <Cork> warning though gif is hard to control the animation of
[03:36:17] <Bauer> oh lol, yeah I meant to convert to gif :P
[03:36:42] <Cork> Bauer: might be worth thinking about just using the <video> tag?
[03:36:55] <Bauer> what do you mean? its hard to control the results of the converstion?
[03:37:21] <Cork> Bauer: gif starts to animate when the browser has finished decoding it
[03:37:38] <Cork> and only way to "reset" it is to load it again from the server (cache escaping)
[03:37:54] <Bauer> ok, and whats the problem with that?
[03:37:57] <Cork> if you are ok with that, the yes gif should work well
[03:38:15] <Cork> Bauer: only if you need to restart it ex. when the image is shown from a click
[03:38:27] <kenansulayman> seutje still alive?
[03:38:33] <Bauer> ah, nah dont care about that, they just want the animated effect lol
[03:38:57] <Cork> Bauer: then ya gif or svg is prob the best option
[03:39:13] <Cork> or canvas if you want to be really creative :)
[03:39:49] <Lewix>   $('sort-wrap').mouseout(function(){$('.sort-wrap').addClass('notshown');})
[03:39:59] <Lewix> what am i doing wrong here?
[03:40:15] <Cork> Lewix: you want this instead of the second selector
[03:40:23] <Cork> $(this).addClass('notshown');
[03:40:36] <Lewix> Cork: isnt it the same thing?
[03:40:39] <Cork> no
[03:40:53] <Cork> $('.sort-wrap') matches all element if any of them get the event
[03:41:09] <Cork> $(this) just matches the one that got the event
[03:41:55] <Lewix> Cork: theres only one .sort-wrap in my html
[03:42:11] <Cork> the missed dot in $('sort-wrap') ?
[03:42:27] <Cork> other then that it should work; though i would recommend using this inside it
[03:42:43] <Lewix> ah thanks
[03:42:48] <Lewix> =)
[03:42:49] <Lewix>   $('.sort-wrap').mouseout(function(){$('this').fadeOut;})
[03:42:53] <Cork> ...
[03:43:00] <Lewix> better?
[03:43:01] <Cork> Lewix: ...., thing again
[03:43:02] <Cork> no
[03:43:07] <Cork> *think
[03:43:16] <Cork> your doing the same mistake again
[03:43:26] <Lewix>   $('.sort-wrap').mouseout(function(){$(this).fadeOut;})
[03:43:30] <Lewix> damn jquery
[03:43:36] <Cork> () after the function call
[03:43:43] <Cork> and prob a speed too
[03:43:52] <Lewix>   $('.sort-wrap').mouseout(function(){$(this).fadeOut();})
[03:44:05] <Bauer> Cork: ok well, just tried one converter - the gif is well, pretty bad :D
[03:44:13] <Cork> :)
[03:44:29] <Cork> ya, gif is what it is, it needs care to look ok
[03:44:54] <Bauer> nah, its not working at all, not even the actual picture of the flash
[03:45:21] <Cork> ah, you actually ran a tool to convert it...
[03:45:26] <Cork> don't think those work
[03:46:13] <Bauer> how can I verify the propagation setting inside the flash file would fix it?
[03:46:41] <Cork> Bauer: if the propagation works in ff and ie it most likely isn't the problem
[03:47:08] <Bauer> that leaves only the overlay solution :( I have no idea yet how to approach this
[03:47:33] <Bauer> I tried z-index on the object to -1, and +1 on the wrapping div
[03:48:11] <Cork> <div style="position: relative; display: inline-block;"><object><embed></object><div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;"></div></div>
[03:48:26] <Cork> opps needed the z-index: 10 on the last div there
[03:49:00] <Cork> Bauer: alternatively you could see if the flash app could fire events from inside it
[03:49:05] <Cork> and then you could catch those
[03:49:13] <Cork> it would prob be even better
[03:49:38] <Sal> is listening event of a button different from listening events of other elements?
[03:49:51] <Cork> Sal: no
[03:50:06] <Sal> if i do $('#mybutton').click() it doesnt fire
[03:50:19] <Sal> while if i do onclick() on the button tag, it does
[03:50:22] <Cork> does the button exist when you run the selector?
[03:50:42] <Sal> i run the selector after its container show
[03:50:49] <Sal> so it should exist
[03:50:56] <Sal> the entire container is a clone
[03:50:57] <Cork> console.log($('#mybutton').length)
[03:51:02] <Cork> uh
[03:51:10] <Cork> so you might have duplicate id's?
[03:51:21] <Cork> (meaning invalid id's)
[03:51:21] <Sal> oh! damn
[03:51:26] <Sal> didn't think of that
[03:51:33] <Sal> how to solve that?
[03:51:47] <Sal> is there a way to add id's after clone?
[03:52:44] <Sal> ok, i'll get with it
[03:52:45] <Sal> thanks
[03:52:53] <Cork> Sal: sure
[03:52:59] <Cork> just select the element and replace the id
[03:53:12] <Sal> $('element').attr('id', 'value');
[04:07:55] <Anchakor> hi, I am getting by ajax() a json data (dataType: "json"), but sometimes (on failure) I get html, how do I catch that and do my stuff with the returned html?
[04:08:20] <Anchakor> now I am getting error: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[04:08:54] <Cork> Anchakor: don't use JSON.parse
[04:09:03] <Cork> and have the server send the correct mime type
[04:09:09] <Cork> and it should just work
[04:09:39] <Cork> typeof(data) == 'string' for example
[04:09:57] <Cork> but it depends on the server not lying
[04:11:32] <Bauer> Cork: and then I do the .click event on the last div?
[04:11:41] <Cork> Bauer: yes
[04:11:56] <Anchakor> I'm not using JSON.parse
[04:12:23] <Anchakor> that is what jquery is using
[04:12:25] <Cork> Anchakor: then your sending application/json header when you send html
[04:13:00] <Cork> Anchakor: and only way to handle that is to override the mime handling in jquery and handle json as text
[04:13:12] <Cork> (or fix the server)
[04:13:19] <Bauer> Cork: so, the end result would be: <wrapper div><Flash Div><Details Button Div></END wrapper div>?
[04:13:35] <Bauer> no, one sec
[04:13:50] <Bauer> Cork: so, the end result would be: <wrapper div><Flash Div><OVERLAY DIV><Details Button Div></END wrapper div>?
[04:13:54] <Bauer> like this?
[04:14:06] <Cork> uh
[04:14:08] <Cork> flash div?
[04:14:09] <Anchakor> Cork: the response is text/html and 500 HTTP code
[04:14:20] <Bauer> Cork: the div inside which the flash object exists
[04:14:35] <Cork> Anchakor: check in your error handler so you don't run JSON.parse there then
[04:14:50] <Cork> Anchakor: cause jquery doesn't parse the body in 500 statuses
[04:15:14] <Cork> Bauer: well or just add the overlay inside that div
[04:15:36] <Cork> Bauer: the important part is that the wrapping div gets the exact dimentions of the flash object
[04:15:43] <Cork> else things will look weird
[04:20:11] <Bauer> Cork: here is the relevant snippet, properly idented: where do you mean to insert the overlay div?
[04:20:12] <Bauer> http://jsfiddle.net/6m8Qk/1/
[04:20:48] <Anchakor> Cork: see this, I don't think the error function is called: http://pastebin.com/g8E6vX6d
[04:21:32] <Cork> Anchakor: success isn't called on status 500
[04:21:45] <Anchakor> Cork: it shouldn't be
[04:21:48] <Cork> if it is, someone has messed with your jquery lib
[04:21:57] <Anchakor> I'm talking about error function
[04:23:42] <Cork> Bauer: http://jsfiddle.net/6m8Qk/2/
[04:23:47] <Cork> Anchakor: yes
[04:25:56] <Anchakor> Cork: the thing is jquery tries to JSON.parse the response even before calling the error function
[04:27:32] <Bauer> thanks Cork, I am still trying to wrap it around in my head to understand how to do it :)
[04:27:35] <Bauer> too many divs lol
[04:28:29] <Cork> Bauer: the point is there should be nothing else around the div (the padding would break things)
[04:28:55] <Cork> position relative means it becomes a position parent
[04:30:55] <Cork> Bauer: display: inline-block means it will grab the dimention from the content
[04:31:05] <Anchakor> Cork: ok, when I removed the 'dataType: "json"' and did JSON.parse manually in the success function it works
[04:31:17] <Cork> Bauer: and finally the position absolute with 0 and z-index means it will be the full size and cover it
[04:31:43] <Cork> Anchakor: sounds like your server doesn't send mimetypes
[04:32:09] <Cork> Anchakor: mimetypes override what you set int type:""
[04:32:20] <Cork> int => in
[04:36:31] <Anchakor> Cork: it does
[04:36:38] <Anchakor> I told you it was text/html
[04:36:50] <Cork> then again something is really broken in the page
[04:36:58] <Cork> cause jquery don't do this by default
[04:42:07] <daveaway> how do i check if a div has a class with a wildcard in it?
[04:42:38] <SuperTyp> Corx sry I lost connection
[04:42:55] <SuperTyp> Cork*
[04:43:05] <SuperTyp> did you watch my pastebin?
[04:43:26] <Cork> daveaway: you don't
[04:43:37] <daveaway> i see
[04:43:38] <Cork> daveaway: you split the class up into several classes
[04:43:53] <Cork> class="this is a set of classes"
[04:44:03] <Cork> $('.classes.set.this')
[04:44:43] <Cork> then you can build selectors based on what set you want to match
[04:44:47] <seutje> doesn't he mean like $('.th*s')
[04:44:52] <seutje> where * is the wildcard
[04:45:01] <Cork> yes
[04:45:10] <Cork> and that is what i answered :)
[04:45:53] <xec> although slow and clumsy, you could use a custom .filter()
[04:46:00] <seutje> not seeing the wildcard though
[04:46:11] <Cork> meaning instead of class="this-is-a-set-of-classes" $('.this-is-*-set-*-classes')
[04:46:28] <Cork> you do class="this is a set of classes" $('.classes.set.this')
[04:46:29] <xec> seutje: read all the messages
[04:46:54] <Cork> classes already have support for compound searches
[04:49:18] <Bauer> thanks Cork! it works, awesome :) wouldl never have thought of combining those properties together in this way, CSs is my weaker point
[04:49:35] <SuperTyp> Cork, sry to annoy you, do you remeber my issue?
[04:50:11] <SuperTyp> the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/5YxiJtqE
[04:50:27] <Cork> ah right that one
[04:50:33] <Cork> ya i answered it too
[04:50:34] <SuperTyp> I did it now (hope so) like you showed me the flow
[04:50:59] <Cork> if you want to check enteredBool before you set it to true then yes that works
[04:51:38] <SuperTyp> and if I dont want to :D
[04:51:41] <SuperTyp> o
[04:51:48] <SuperTyp> what i want to do
[04:52:37] <SuperTyp> scenario: start page contains a enter button
[04:52:40] <SuperTyp> and a logo
[04:52:56] <seutje> Cork: I thought this was the requirement: http://jsfiddle.net/mHq2w/
[04:53:16] <SuperTyp> If you're not in the startpage a click on the logo should do nothing
[04:53:28] <Cork> seutje: well yes, but then you arn't using classes
[04:53:36] <Cork> seutje: you are using attributes on the elements
[04:53:37] <SuperTyp> ah sry should load the startpage
[04:53:50] <Cork> seutje: and the answer i gave gives the same effect but without the speed loss
[04:54:01] <SuperTyp> if you are on the startpage the logo should do nothing on click
[04:54:16] <xec> ?one @ SuperTyp
[04:54:22] <seutje> oh, I'm not gonna deny this is a horrible idea and would only serve to uncover flaws in the setup
[04:54:23] <xec> hrmph
[04:54:45] <xec> SuperTyp: if you want a click handler to only fire once, see .one() http://api.jquery.com/one/
[04:55:15] <SuperTyp> xec I check this
[04:55:18] <SuperTyp> thx
[04:55:20] <seutje> might be usefull for debugging and refactoring though, if you just wanna catch everything that has a certain pattern in their class attribute
[05:01:39] <k_89> i want to allow only ctrl+v on a text input, and as soon as its pasted, i'd like to select the whole text
[05:07:13] <Serdar> how can I check if $('#' + msg.ID).exist()?
[05:07:38] <sacho_> $('selector').length
[05:07:38] <SuperTyp> xec .one() does not seem to make what I need
[05:08:15] <xec> SuperTyp: what exactly is it you want?
[05:09:27] <SuperTyp> startpage click logo -> nothing happens, click enter -> content slides in (logo stays). click logo -> startpage slides in
[05:09:27] <seutje> SuperTyp: he meant "length" literally, as a property
[05:09:38] <seutje> not as a placeholder for "whatever you expect it to be"
[05:09:56] <SuperTyp> seutje: we talk about something else
[05:10:14] <seutje> oh lol, names were too similar for my puny brain to discern the two
[05:11:12] <SuperTyp> xec:  startpage click logo -> nothing happens, click enter -> content slides in (logo stays). click logo -> startpage slides in, content slides out
[05:11:29] <xec> SuperTyp: ok, and what do you have thus far?
[05:11:32] <farciarz84> hi I wrote $('<div/>').text(facebook_post).html(); and unicode charracters are not displayed properly
[05:11:47] <farciarz84> where is the problem?
[05:12:30] <Birliban> Hi! I use jqueryui's autocomplete and want to select an option from a dropdown when an item from autocomplete has been chosen. to select an option via the value, i can use $("#thatSelect").val("somevalue") But how to do this not with the value but with the Text beween <option></option>?
[05:12:33] <farciarz84> can I convert the facebook_post to something which jquery will parse correctly?
[05:13:00] <sacho_> what's "facebook_post"?
[05:13:22] <sacho_> do you have a fiddle demonstrating this?
[05:14:20] <seutje> Birliban: .autocomplete({select: function( event, ui ) { $("#thatSelect").val(ui.value); } }) or something
[05:14:50] <daveaway> $(".alreadytaggedtags").on('.hover','.editable',function(){  that should work on newly created divs with editable (which are contained within a div called alreadytaggedtags)
[05:14:54] <farciarz84> sacho_: http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/Qdx1Zq0jk
[05:14:56] <daveaway> $(".alreadytaggedtags").on('.hover','.editable',function(){  that should work on newly created divs with editable (which are contained within a div called alreadytaggedtags)
[05:15:05] <daveaway> right?
[05:15:30] <daveaway> oops... ".hover."
[05:15:35] <SuperTyp> xec: I reduced the code to the main problem: http://pastebin.com/ADQapde0
[05:16:04] <SuperTyp> its the if that doesent fire
[05:16:17] <farciarz84> sacho_: post is just value.title
[05:16:33] <SuperTyp> Crok already told me why and I understood why but dunno how to write it right
[05:16:57] <SuperTyp> as it doesent make sense to me to place the if before the click function
[05:17:17] <sacho_> farciarz84, nice, but what value does it have really
[05:17:27] <sacho_> do you have a test case showing what you're doing
[05:17:58] <krambiorix> hi, i want to loop from 1 to 29 in intervals of 10 ... for(c = 1;c < 29;c+10){  -> this always gives me 1 -> 11 .... ?!
[05:18:49] <SuperTyp> krambiorix: you start at 1 and add 10
[05:18:54] <xec> SuperTyp: line 10 will run before 7
[05:19:04] <SuperTyp> krambiorix: isnt that that 11^^
[05:19:07] <seutje> daveaway: using "hover" with on is deprecated, isn't it?
[05:19:11] <krambiorix> SuperTyp, yes but c is always 1 ...
[05:19:21] <xec> krambiorix: c += 10 ?
[05:19:34] <xec> krambiorix: as opposed to "c+10"
[05:19:47] <SuperTyp> xec is right
[05:20:11] <SuperTyp> ++ is equal to x+=1
[05:20:39] <SuperTyp> xec I know but how do I do it right?
[05:22:59] <SuperTyp> xec this doesnt work eithed: http://pastebin.com/bzkraC5N
[05:23:29] <Birliban> seutje, ok thanks. will look into this
[05:24:58] <krambiorix> xec, SuperTyp  ok that's solved ,but after 3 times looping (as it should) it stays looping for  1 -> 11 ... http://pastebin.com/mpNVMkRF
[05:25:33] <joe____> i am trying to loop through a json object and bind some values.. but does not seems to work : this is how i am trying to get the value  this.children.[0].label
[05:26:50] <seutje> krambiorix: I'm confused why are you setting c to 1 just to set it to 0 right away?
[05:26:58] <seutje> it's 1 value is essentially never used, is it?
[05:27:01] <Serdar> sacho, thank you
[05:27:02] <seutje> its*
[05:28:35] <joe____> thanks but i got it working
[05:28:38] <SuperTyp> krambiorix: so the loop doesnt stop?
[05:28:47] <krambiorix> SuperTyp, indeed
[05:28:56] <krambiorix> seutje, yes thanks, removed that
[05:28:57] <seutje> krambiorix: both these work fine for me: http://jsfiddle.net/hU66J/ && http://jsfiddle.net/ceX83/
[05:30:24] <xec> SuperTyp: sorry, disconnected. made a fiddle though: http://jsfiddle.net/FF9md/
[05:31:51] <SuperTyp> xec thats exactly how it should be :)
[05:31:51] <xec> SuperTyp: http://jsfiddle.net/FF9md/1/
[05:32:23] <SuperTyp> xec is using booleans a bad thing in js?
[05:32:26] <krambiorix> seutje, SuperTyp it keeps looping.... 1->10,11-20,21->30, 1->11,1->11... till the end of time
[05:32:40] <SuperTyp> only problems with them...
[05:32:49] <seutje> krambiorix: no it doesn't
[05:33:01] <xec> SuperTyp: absolutely not, go ahead - it's just logic
[05:33:16] <SuperTyp> krambiorix: maybe because you are jumping out of the bound?
[05:33:27] <svector> setting changeYear: true, changeMonth: true makes the year and month selector stacked on each other
[05:33:46] <SuperTyp> c < 29 but 33<29 ? could this be?
[05:33:51] <svector> they're supposed to be side by side
[05:34:22] <seutje> wonder if the non-async ajax request is fucking with the loop
[05:35:38] <SuperTyp> xec I know its logic but I dont get it working with boolean :D i will use your way though
[05:37:15] <seutje> SuperTyp: just use a scoped variable then http://jsfiddle.net/FF9md/3/
[05:37:59] <krambiorix> seutje, nope, async or non-async, no difference
[05:38:14] <SuperTyp> i look at it later again
[05:38:39] <SuperTyp> need to focus on lecture now :)
[05:38:49] <SuperTyp> databases :D
[05:40:29] <joroci> do you know any ajax manager plugin or got an idea on how to create it?
[05:45:26] <krambiorix> anyone experiences ajax calls in a for loop which turns out in an infinite loop?
[05:46:11] <Cork> krambiorix: if you expect the callbacks from the ajax call to affect the loop, yes that will cause that
[05:46:24] <krambiorix> the loop isn't restarting at 1->11 , in the loop itself i log xxxxx and i don't see that appearing anymore
[05:46:36] <krambiorix> Cork, what can i do about that?
[05:47:02] <Cork> krambiorix: you can have each ajax call wait for the previous one
[05:47:40] <Cork> function makeCall(index) { makeCall(++index) } makeCall(0)
[05:47:46] <Cork> opps
[05:47:58] <Cork> function makeCall(index) { if(index > 100) { return } makeCall(++index) } makeCall(0)
[05:48:57] <krambiorix> Cork, what is index then?
[05:49:04] <xec> 0
[05:49:08] <Cork> makeCall(0)
[05:49:28] <Cork> that one loops from 0 to 100 and stops
[05:49:51] <krambiorix> Cork, it should run from 1, 11, 21 ...
[05:49:59] <Cork> ok
[05:50:06] <Cork> function makeCall(index) { if(index > 100) { return } makeCall(index+10) } makeCall(0)
[05:50:08] <Cork> done
[05:51:12] <Cork> the difference is this loop can work async
[05:51:16] <Cork> while a for loop can't
[05:51:41] <xec> well, you could make a bunch of async calls in a for...
[05:51:53] <xec> if you don't make the for loop infinite... :P
[05:52:06] <Cork> sure, but not if the async callback needs to act one each iteration
[05:52:21] <xec> yeah sure, but why do you assume that?
[05:52:51] <Cork> i don't
[05:53:27] * xec is confused
[05:53:29] <Cork> xec: this entire line of comments came from that exact question
[05:53:33] <krambiorix> Cork, where should i put my ajax call? in makeCall ?
[05:53:41] <Cork> krambiorix: yes
[05:53:50] <xec> krambiorix: start with telling us exactly what it is you're trying to do
[05:53:52] <krambiorix> Cork, after the makeCall in the makeCall?
[05:53:57] <daveaway> using jquery, how do i remove everything and including p tags
[05:53:59] <Cork> krambiorix: and the makeCall(index+10) inside the success callback
[05:54:19] <Cork> daveaway: and including?
[05:54:21] <daveaway> i double click on something, if it contains <p> tags, how do i remove them.. and the text it contains
[05:54:33] <daveaway> aye and including
[05:54:33] <xec> krambiorix: and please answer Cork's question: do you expect the callbacks from the ajax call to affect the loop?
[05:54:46] <Cork> if($(this).find('p').length > 0) { $(this).remove() }
[05:55:02] <daveaway> that simple, damnit i should have known that
[05:55:05] <daveaway> k, cheers cork
[05:56:47] <krambiorix> xec, Cork nope, shouldn't affect the loop
[05:57:15] <Cork> krambiorix: in that case then ajax won't have any effect on the looå
[05:57:18] <Cork> *loop
[05:57:26] <Cork> cause they won't ever run before the loop has ended
[05:57:32] <krambiorix> Cork, xec , i tried what Cork said, but after 29 it restarts to 1
[05:57:37] <krambiorix> and stays one
[05:57:44] <Cork> O_o
[05:57:57] <Cork> your resetting something somewhere
[05:58:12] <xec> krambiorix: show us your code?
[05:59:21] <krambiorix> xec, Cork http://pastebin.com/F6JKYbvJ
[06:00:24] <Cork> wait...
[06:00:25] <Cork> $(this).ajaxtest(index+10)??
[06:01:55] <krambiorix> Cork, i want to pass the parameters as 1->11, 12->21,22->29
[06:02:48] <Cork> i don't see why you would get a restart with this code
[06:03:41] <krambiorix> Cork, when it restarts i don't get any logging of console.log
[06:04:14] <Cork> so you have some other code that runs beside this most likely
[06:04:25] <krambiorix> Cork, nope
[06:04:37] <Cork> else you would get at lest some logs
[06:04:54] <Cork> console.log('RRRRRRRRRRRRRR:'+rangestart+"-->"+rangeend); if nothing else
[06:06:17] <Bauer> Is there any jQuery style to do this: https://github.com/allmarkedup/purl but only for the URL of the current loaded page? so I'd know which actions to do in .ready
[06:06:49] <krambiorix> Cork, even if i get  remove the call in the success , it keeps looping....
[06:06:52] <Cork> Bauer: depends on where you need it
[06:07:00] <Cork> Bauer: some of it is privided natively by the browser
[06:07:20] <Cork> krambiorix: agan then, some other code is at work
[06:07:22] <Bauer> Cork: what do you mean where? in the Javascript, so I'd be able to check if service
[06:07:36] <Bauer> if service=="vm" for example, do certain things
[06:07:37] <Cork> Bauer: what url is it you need to fiddle with?
[06:07:45] <Cork> links?
[06:07:47] <Cork> current page?
[06:07:48] <Cork> what?
[06:08:06] <krambiorix> Cork, but then i would see the logging , no?
[06:08:06] <Bauer> Cork: for example https://cloud-dev.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=mail I need to check what service is equal to (or if its null
[06:08:25] <Cork> krambiorix: only if this code did the looping
[06:08:53] <Cork> Bauer: again links, current page or what?
[06:09:08] <Cork> that is just an url, not where you want to use the check
[06:09:09] <Bauer> Cork: current page's URL
[06:09:21] <Cork> window.location.search
[06:09:27] <krambiorix> ow hell , Cork i think i found it
[06:09:29] <xec> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/9j5dS/
[06:10:25] <Bauer> thanks Cork! so now I can use window.location.href and feed it into that plugin, to easily retrieve what I need :)
[06:17:45] <Rohan_Bhangui_> grafi: you up?
[06:18:01] <grafi> out and about
[06:18:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> k
[06:18:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> how did your pull request go
[06:18:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: did it work?
[06:20:08] <grafi> didnt I highlgiht you yesterday?
[06:20:36] <grafi> http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[06:20:39] <grafi> there it is :P
[06:21:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: how i nthe hlel did you manage that
[06:21:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> i couldnt figure it out
[06:21:22] <krambiorix> Cork, xec i restarted FF and now it works :s
[06:21:27] <krambiorix> wtf
[06:21:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: and dont tell me magic or voodo i aint buying it
[06:21:52] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui created a gh-pages branch, pushed it
[06:21:52] <grafi> ^^
[06:21:57] <grafi> it really was that simple
[06:21:58] <grafi> :P
[06:22:04] <grafi> all we have to do now
[06:22:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice
[06:22:20] <grafi> is to push all changes to master, to the gh-pages branch as well
[06:22:25] <grafi> so it gets updated
[06:22:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> and do chagnes get auto pushed to the io link?
[06:22:31] <grafi> not sure if that can be automated
[06:22:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[06:22:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> what i mean i
[06:22:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> sif i sync to master will it sync to gh-pages
[06:24:04] <grafi> dont thing so
[06:24:40] <grafi> http://lea.verou.me/2011/10/easily-keep-gh-pages-in-sync-with-master/
[06:24:43] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui ^
[06:24:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[06:25:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: im a noob at git so i use their windwos app :D
[06:25:39] <grafi> that sucks ^^
[06:25:47] <grafi> just open a terminal and do it xD
[06:25:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:25:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> meh
[06:26:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> im on windows
[06:26:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> cmd isnt that powerful but ill try
[06:26:19] <grafi> i mean you could possibly do some kind of merging magic into the pages branch anytime
[06:26:21] <grafi> or something
[06:26:25] <grafi> not sure if that would work
[06:26:26] <grafi> ^^
[06:26:34] <grafi> or delete branch greate brnach
[06:26:42] <grafi> but surely that not optimal
[06:27:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> what evs...we can figure that stuff out once we are closer to release
[06:27:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: have you looked into a grid system
[06:27:28] <grafi> nope
[06:27:37] <grafi> im not sure how we should do that
[06:27:39] <Sam_Stiles> Rohan_Bhangui: what  grid system do you recmmend?
[06:27:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: https://github.com/rohanbhangui/frontend
[06:28:04] <grafi> haha
[06:28:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: http://rohanbhangui.github.io/frontend/
[06:28:13] <grafi> not an answer to the question
[06:28:13] <grafi> xD
[06:28:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: at least it will answer why we dont want an existing grid
[06:28:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> but rather something ore custom
[06:28:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> but yes it doesnt directly answer question
[06:29:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: to answer your question directly, i want to create my own sort of system
[06:29:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: what you think we should impliment (this thing is as much as mine as it is yours)
[06:30:08] <Sam_Stiles> Rohan_Bhangui: I'm planning on doing the same
[06:30:11] <Sam_Stiles> Bootstrap has too much bloat
[06:30:14] <grafi> haha
[06:30:21] <grafi> lets all build our own :D
[06:30:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you mind having 1 more on board
[06:30:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: wanna join our effort?
[06:31:31] <Sam_Stiles> I've already thought of a name for mine and bought a domain..
[06:31:33] <Sam_Stiles> :P
[06:31:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: to answer your question i use a 960px or 1200px grid  http://960.gs/
[06:32:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: mine doesnt have a name nor domain.....we can merge projects if you want
[06:32:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> well not mine really ours (grafi and I)
[06:33:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: isnt that right?
[06:34:32] <grafi> right right
[06:34:33] <grafi> :P
[06:34:55] <grafi> Sam_Stiles whats the name?
[06:34:55] <grafi> :D
[06:35:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: what your ping didnt work?
[06:35:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[06:35:56] <grafi> it only makes the line green ^^
[06:36:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:36:13] <grafi> its not like im conditiioned to open mirc then xD
[06:36:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:36:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: so what sort of grid we gonna use?
[06:37:09] <grafi> i propose a 120px grid
[06:37:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> found this which is successor to a grid I am fond of http://unsemantic.com/
[06:37:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> hahahaha
[06:37:17] <grafi> already mobile compatible
[06:37:18] <grafi> :D
[06:37:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> more like ipod nano compatible
[06:37:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> we should make a site
[06:37:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> that reads marquee feeds
[06:37:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats all it is
[06:37:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> news in marquee feeds
[06:38:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> any ideas?
[06:38:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: still there?
[06:39:21] <Sam_Stiles> Rohan_Bhangui: yeah sorry at work so I'm somewhat sporadic in chat :P
[06:39:40] <Sam_Stiles> The grid portion of the framework I wanted to build is the one part that I was kinda like "hmmm...." ... not sure how I'd build one from scratch...
[06:39:49] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Whatever "WAT" is on Github... I'm scared.
[06:40:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: you have a preview of what you have so far
[06:40:28] <Sam_Stiles> grafi / Rohan_Bhangui: I'm canadian french so I had planned on naming it BeauCSS (and bought a domain to match)
[06:40:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: one that i prefer btw: http://unsemantic.com/
[06:40:46] <grafi> french peoples
[06:40:47] <grafi> :D
[06:41:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:41:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> hahaha
[06:41:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> well Sam_Stilesto give a bit of background our project is meant as a way of rapid prototyping of flat design
[06:41:45] <BillCriswell> Is jquery asking cpu power for the server?
[06:42:20] <Sam_Stiles> Sort of what I had planned on doing too Rohan
[06:42:29] <Sam_Stiles> You guys familiar with Git?
[06:42:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: tell you what .... use the link i posted above or wait a few weeks and grafi and I will have something up
[06:42:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> Sam_Stiles: aquainted
[06:43:13] <BillCriswell> Sam_Stiles: I can fake it pretty well.
[06:43:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol ^^
[06:43:32] <Sam_Stiles> BillCriswell: bahaha that's how I felt for my first 2 years using it...
[06:43:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: so what you wanna do impliment our own?
[06:44:15] <grafi> lol BillCriswell
[06:44:15] <grafi> everytime you troll me
[06:44:16] <grafi> a penguin dies
[06:44:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:44:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> hahaha
[06:44:55] <grafi> im waiting for you to come up with an awesome idea
[06:44:57] <grafi> *cough*
[06:45:10] <grafi> grids are like my arch nemesis
[06:45:11] <grafi> :|
[06:45:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh lol i thought that was your department
[06:45:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: well here is my thought, we do mobile seperately
[06:45:57] <SuperTyp_iOS> Test
[06:46:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> SuperTyp_iOS: hearing you loud and clear
[06:46:10] <BillCriswell> grafi: The git thing totally wasn't to be honest. At least command line git. I can do what I need as long as I have Google + StackOverflow though.
[06:46:37] <BillCriswell> We use SVN at work so I don't touch git as often as I'd like.
[06:46:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: google + stackoverflow : programmers world
[06:47:02] <grafi> BillCriswell well with internet
[06:47:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: we keep mobile seperate and work with a min grid of 1200px
[06:47:06] <grafi> you can do anything
[06:47:08] <grafi> :P
[06:47:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: what you think
[06:47:32] <grafi> i already think that not flexible enough
[06:47:33] <grafi> xD
[06:47:33] <BillCriswell> grafi: True. I canhalf ass anything with the internet's help.
[06:47:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: lol
[06:47:46] <grafi> i kind of want to tell my container how big it can be
[06:47:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> what down size to 960?
[06:47:55] <grafi> and let the grid do the rest
[06:48:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[06:48:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> well but we ned claes on children of container
[06:48:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> like grid - 50
[06:48:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> grid-50
[06:48:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> or something
[06:48:20] <grafi> yeah
[06:48:22] <grafi> something
[06:48:24] <grafi> exactly
[06:48:25] <grafi> :P
[06:48:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmm
[06:48:35] <grafi> i think good names are important
[06:48:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay got idea
[06:48:41] <grafi> for the calculations
[06:48:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> default= space them evenly
[06:48:48] <grafi> we can probably just use some sass magic
[06:48:49] <grafi> ...
[06:48:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[06:48:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> im thinking using data-attribute
[06:49:01] <grafi> that generates all kinds of fractions or something
[06:49:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then we can proceses that
[06:49:10] <grafi> might be cool
[06:49:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: check these guys out
[06:49:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://unsemantic.com/
[06:49:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> we might get ideas
[06:49:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: id like to minimize js burden
[06:49:56] <Anticom> hey guys
[06:50:01] <grafi> sure
[06:50:09] <grafi> but css can read data attributes right?
[06:50:27] <grafi> or am i imagineing things
[06:50:45] <Anticom> i'm looking for a color picker plugin, that works with current jq version and (if necessary with current jq-ui version). Any suggestions?
[06:51:09] <Anticom> I've like clicked through the whole plugin repo with plugins tagged colorpicker but none of those worked for me :/
[06:51:29] <grafi> what does that mean?
[06:51:32] <grafi> they dont work
[06:51:35] <grafi> or you dont like them
[06:51:35] <grafi> ?
[06:51:50] <Anticom> no, using the current jq versions the pickers just don't work
[06:51:51] <Anticom> literally
[06:51:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi:  i dont think they can read data-atributes
[06:51:54] <grafi> Anticom look here http://www.unheap.com/section/inputs-forms/color-pickers/ ?
[06:51:58] <grafi> hm
[06:52:04] <grafi> where did i get that idea from
[06:52:05] <grafi> :x
[06:52:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think grafi
[06:52:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> id check though
[06:52:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> and I dont like burdening js
[06:52:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause it gets slow
[06:52:33] <grafi> cause not everyone has it ^^
[06:52:36] <grafi> enabled at least :p
[06:52:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats the difference between css transitions and js trnasitions
[06:52:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> no its not (i actually didnt think of that)
[06:53:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> its just slow
[06:53:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> esp. if your adjusting sizes using window.resize
[06:53:16] <grafi> hm
[06:53:31] <grafi> apparently it works for content on pseudo elements
[06:53:48] <grafi> and of course you could proably use selectors like [data-width="600px"]
[06:53:55] <grafi> not sure thats cool though ^^
[06:53:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> well ya
[06:54:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> it relaly isnt
[06:54:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> id look into sass
[06:54:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> they should ahve something like that
[06:54:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> or so i am guesing
[06:55:11] <grafi> how would they
[06:55:22] <grafi> sass compiles down
[06:55:31] <grafi> so if it aint in css it aint possible ^^
[06:56:33] <jxpx777> Absolutely stupid issue: Hiding some divs on dom ready. Divs have images in them. When I show them later, the images never display. What's the secret sauce to get the images to show?
[06:56:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol true
[06:56:53] <Guest78729> you can target data-attributes with css: http://jsfiddle.net/8DNRd/1/
[06:56:55] <Sam_Stiles> jxpx777: post a gist?
[06:57:21] <Sam_Stiles> Guest78729: not supported in older browsers though
[06:57:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> Guest78729: we need to be able to process the values
[06:58:08] <Guest78729> Gotcha... I tried IE8 emulation mode and jsfiddle choked. IE9 looked good.
[06:58:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:58:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> ie8
[06:58:52] <jxpx777> Sam_Stiles: https://gist.github.com/jxpx777/7677073
[07:00:14] <grafi> well ie9 would be good enough for me ^^
[07:01:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[07:05:18] <grafi> Rohan_Bhangui http://codepen.io/tysonmatanich/pen/johpn something like this looks simple enough
[07:08:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> oaky brb
[07:14:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> oaky back
[07:14:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: looks interesting
[07:15:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: well for default we should auto calculate
[07:21:10] <grafi> sure
[07:25:46] <JohnTorrance> How can I retrieve the "browser's handle" of a tag from a jquery-returned variable?
[07:26:42] <javalover> john what you mean by that?
[07:26:47] <javalover> browsers handle of a tag?
[07:28:39] <JohnTorrance> javalover: I'm trying to apply .getContext() to a canvas tag, but the variable that I'm applying it to is a newly created tag through $("<canvs></canvs>").appendTo("#whatever"), so I think that what I'm calling is a non-existant jquery function
[07:28:44] <JohnTorrance> (new to javascript)
[07:30:06] <pachet> JohnTorrance: <canvs>?
[07:30:18] <Anticom> what did .live() replace again in newer jq versions?
[07:30:18] <JohnTorrance> pachet: *<canvas>
[07:30:24] <Anticom> was it .on() ?
[07:30:32] <pachet> $('<canvas />').get(0).getContext('2d')
[07:31:11] <pachet> Anticom: .on() consolidated .live() and .bind()
[07:31:24] <grafi> also delegate
[07:31:35] <pachet> right
[07:32:01] <JohnTorrance> pachet: thought so. I just didn't want to put that .get() in there. Thanks.
[07:32:27] <Anticom> JohnTorrance for explanation: (almost) everything $() returns is a jQuery collections. .get([index]) get's you the native DOM reference of collection[index]
[07:34:41] <pachet> JohnTorrance: $('<canvas />')[0] is synonymous, if you prefer that
[07:39:26] <Anticom> pachet i prefer using .get() :p
[07:39:35] <Anticom> it's more explicit
[07:39:42] <Anticom> from a semantic standpoint
[07:40:02] <Anticom> it's the same with $(fn() {}) vs. $(document).ready(fn() {});
[07:40:05] <Anticom> i prefer the second
[07:55:19] <sekyms> Anyone played with Snapsvg yet?
[07:56:30] <Anticom> .on() doesn't work on elements i add to dom using jq
[07:56:38] <grafi> oO
[07:56:39] <Anticom> :(
[07:56:46] <grafi> do you even delegate`
[07:56:47] <grafi> ?
[07:57:08] <sekyms> you have to do $("existingDOMELEMENt").on("click", "one that was added", function() {}
[07:57:33] <Anticom> http://jsbin.com/apIYUsoc/1/edit
[07:57:44] <Anticom> (just don't click the submitbutton^^)
[07:57:57] <Anticom> click "+" and then try to delete the inserted element
[07:57:58] <sekyms> is that speichern?
[07:58:12] <Anticom> sekyms yep, speichern (ger) = save
[07:58:31] <krambiorix> is it possible to set a datepicker on a field that has not yet been created yet?
[07:58:55] <grafi> Anticom  $('#palette').on('click', '.delete', function() {
[07:59:01] <grafi> should do it
[07:59:11] <sekyms> http://jsbin.com/apIYUsoc/2/
[07:59:30] <sekyms> krambiorix: you have to wait until it's created in my experience
[07:59:53] <Anticom> cheers grafi
[08:00:07] <sekyms> Anticom my link has the same answer ;)
[08:00:18] <Anticom> i rly should take a look at jq's "new" syntactic stuff
[08:00:25] <grafi> too late suckaaaa
[08:00:25] <grafi> :D
[08:00:26] <Anticom> sekyms then cheers to you too :p
[08:00:33] <sekyms> I DEMAND CREDIT lol

[08:02:56] <sekyms> otherwise i would probably drink lots of caffeine
[08:03:31] <sekyms> SQUREL!
[08:04:22] <Anticom> sekyms seriously now. Not sure if ADHD is the english term for german ADHS but i guess that's it. i used to take amphetamines aswell since i got that too but over time i prefered not to take them anymore but deal with it and learn to live with it
[08:04:27] <Anticom> </wisdom of the day>
[08:04:36] <Anticom> well, gotta continue working anyway
[08:04:40] <Anticom> thx again
[08:04:46] <sekyms> lol well im an old man on them
[08:04:51] <sekyms> and am addicted
[08:05:23] <sekyms> Bad documentation is bad :(
[08:11:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: any new ideas
[08:14:45] <grafi> nah dude
[08:14:45] <grafi> :P
[08:15:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmmwell why not get stated on something a bit easy
[08:15:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> see how we can style radio buttons
[08:15:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[08:15:45] <grafi> getting good on the highlighting :D
[08:17:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[08:17:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: see what you can find with radio buttons and push to project
[08:19:13] <vayikra> Hi, all. I have a question about using _trigger when the original element ofa UI widget is replaced. Similarly to the ui.resizable widget, I do a this.element.wrap to wrap the original element. Then I do this.element = this.element.parent(). AFter this.element is changed my ._trigger calls do nothing if I have used .on() to subscribe to my widget's events. Could anyone shed some light on this?
[08:19:19] <vayikra> http://jsbin.com/aRUCarIY/6/edit?html,js,console,output
[08:20:07] <vayikra> If you click the button nothing will be printed in the console. IF you comment this.element = this.element.parent everything will work as expected.
[08:31:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: so bored to lazy
[08:32:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> *so lazy
[08:33:37] <grafi> haha
[08:33:37] <grafi> ^^
[08:33:44] <grafi> to lazy to be bored?
[08:33:45] <grafi> :D
[08:34:32] <Chuwiey> Hi all, I've run into a problem with jQuery.Callbacks()
[08:34:50] <Chuwiey> essentially, if a callback is passed in, and it contains an error, no future callbacks will be fired
[08:35:03] <Chuwiey> is there a way around this?
[08:35:57] <Chuwiey> I wrapped the .fire() in a try-catch, but that didn't help
[08:42:48] <grafi> crazy, this is the first time I hear of $.callbacks()
[08:42:50] <grafi> ._.
[08:44:57] <grafi> Chuwiey what does "has an error" mean exactly?
[08:45:44] <Chuwiey> grafi: throws an exception of some sorts, whether via throw or having an internal error in that callback
[08:46:18] <grafi> hm
[08:46:38] <grafi> I wonder if that isnt more of a general thing with javascript
[08:46:56] <grafi> I guess maybe dont throw exceptions? ^^
[08:47:27] <Chuwiey> well, since callbacks are self contained, if you were to wrap it in a try-catch at the jQuery level, i doubt it would block future callback firing
[08:47:45] <Chuwiey> as for not throwing exceptions :) if i were the one passing in the callbacks, that might work...
[08:47:53] <Chuwiey> but i don't have control over that
[08:47:54] <grafi> ha
[08:47:55] <grafi> :P
[08:49:03] <grafi> maybe you can wrap the callbacks somehow?
[08:49:19] <grafi> so that the wrapper handles any exceptions thrown
[08:49:23] <grafi> idk
[08:49:31] <Chuwiey> hmm, maybe that could work...
[08:50:43] <grafi> otherwise callbacks that just throw around random exceptions seems odd to me :D
[08:54:01] <Chuwiey> well, you always have the potential for people to write bad code :)
[08:54:57] <grafi> sure
[08:56:18] <samholmes> This is annoying: I'm making requests using (tried both) $.get or $.getJSON and the callback isn't being called. Web Inspector shows that the request is just failing, but I get no HTTP response code. If I open the page and make the request in my browser, it returns an empty array (json), no failing. This is also only a problem on the production server, but on the development server it works just fine.
[08:56:33] <samholmes> I just can't get any information as to why it's failing
[08:56:38] <samholmes> jQuery isn't telling me anything
[08:57:24] <Chuwiey> samholmes: if you have no http response code, jquery has nothing to respond to
[08:57:29] <Chuwiey> it will eventually timeout
[08:57:35] <daveaway> how do i define an array in order to send it over ajax?
[08:57:39] <samholmes> Chuwiey: it fails immediately
[08:57:46] <daveaway> i can serializeArray and add to it, but how do i define it so it's in that format?
[08:57:55] <samholmes> Chuwiey: it works when I use the browser to make the request
[08:57:56] <samholmes> that is
[08:58:05] <samholmes> I open a tab with the same URI as the ajax request
[08:58:21] <samholmes> also, it works fine on development (localhost), but fails for some reason on prod
[08:59:23] <Chuwiey> samholmes: hmm... what is the response code for just using the same URI (i'm going to assume this is definitely a get request endpoint)
[08:59:57] <samholmes> Chuwiey: 200 is the code
[09:00:43] <samholmes> I'm using jQuery version 1.7
[09:00:52] <samholmes> I wonder if that has something to do with it?
[09:02:36] <samholmes> 1.7.2
[09:02:41] <Chuwiey> is this a cors request per chance?
[09:04:37] <samholmes> what's that?
[09:05:01] <samholmes> Chuwiey: What's a cors request?
[09:05:39] <Chuwiey> are you hitting a domain that is different then the one you're on? (a.domain.com -> b.domain.com, and/or domaina.com -> domainb.com)
[09:05:59] <samholmes> Nah
[09:06:30] <samholmes> Chuwiey: The domain's the same
[09:06:35] <samholmes> does the path have anything to do with it?
[09:06:49] <Chuwiey> so, my best guess is:
[09:06:53] <Chuwiey> 1) you have a typo somewhere
[09:06:54] <samholmes> What about HTTPs?
[09:07:01] <samholmes> HTTPS*
[09:07:18] <samholmes> If it was a typo, why would it work on the localhost?
[09:07:29] <Chuwiey> 2) your backend is not returning the right thing
[09:07:37] <Chuwiey> and yes, http->https and vice versa counts
[09:07:51] <Chuwiey> as for localhost typo, i assume you changed the url you are hitting, no?
[09:07:57] <kevindank> Hello, im looking for a way to change the color of an image using a colorwheel on the front end...sort of like http://www.colorware.com/p-355-iphone-5.aspx#www.colorware.com/p-355-iphone-5.aspx#
[09:08:16] <kevindank> So youd have an image of a product (tshirt) and then you use a color wheel to preview what that will look like
[09:08:16] <samholmes> Chuwiey: I make the request with '/relative/paths
[09:08:53] <Chuwiey> ok, then it's probably 2 or the https if you are hitting that from http
[09:09:24] <samholmes> http://pastebin.com/VMvEeVA8
[09:09:28] <samholmes> there's the code
[09:10:25] <samholmes> Chuwiey: The $.getJSON part is definitely executed (I set a breakpoint there)
[09:11:03] <samholmes> Chuwiey: shouldn't $.getJSON use HTTPS if the page it's on is HTTPS?
[09:11:17] <Chuwiey> yes
[09:11:51] <samholmes> Chuwiey: Request URL:https://xxxxxxxxx.com/fetch/advertising/best-bids?locationId=2&categoryId=6
[09:12:06] <samholmes> That's what the web inspector is telling me
[09:12:37] <tash> I have a textarea that I want to say 'Max 150 characters' when presented to the user, but disappears when you click in it to start typing. What's that called?
[09:13:10] <Chuwiey> samholmes: can you show the network tab request headers vs reponse headers
[09:13:17] <Chuwiey> strip out hostnames and the like...
[09:14:47] <tash> nevermind, found it ... placeholder
[09:14:59] <culh> stackoverflow?
[09:15:39] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:15:58] <jomofcw> Any tips/issue/hack about the bug "outerHeight() return an object", please ?
[09:16:32] <jomofcw> I'm going to rewrite some script replacing outerHeight() by outerHeight(false) but if there is an easier solution... ?
[09:16:54] <samholmes> Chuwiey: like this: http://cl.ly/image/2w2J2N2l210P
[09:18:36] <samholmes> Chuwiey: http://cl.ly/image/2o1Z0l3Q0j3J
[09:21:42] <Chuwiey> samholmes: ok, that's what i was wanting to see, yeah
[09:21:50] <Chuwiey> i still think this is some cors issue
[09:21:57] <Chuwiey> maybe a different port, maybe something else
[09:21:59] <Chuwiey> i don't know
[09:22:11] <Chuwiey> but, i've only ever seen those types of fails from that
[09:22:24] <Chuwiey> sorry that i can't be of more assistance right now :)
[09:22:31] <samholmes> I updated the server code to just respond with a specific JSON value, and it still doesn't work
[09:22:49] <samholmes> I think you're right that it has to be something like CORS
[09:22:58] <samholmes> but I don't know what...
[09:23:44] <samholmes> It just doesn't make sense why this would be failing over something like CORS, wouldn't all my requests be failing if it had to do with HTTPS or something..
[09:24:02] <Chuwiey> CORS != HTTPS
[09:24:19] <Chuwiey> what you could try to do is switch to $.ajax, and get more definitions in there
[09:24:27] <Chuwiey> print out status messages to the console
[09:24:36] <Chuwiey> and pass in withCredentials: true
[09:24:47] <Chuwiey> like i wrote above, this might also have something to do with your prod server
[09:25:02] <Chuwiey> not responding with the proper headers, so i would look at your server logs as well
[09:35:01] <samholmes> Chuwiey: Fucking Ad Block...
[09:35:16] <Chuwiey> ha
[09:35:21] <samholmes> Seriously, why does AdBlock do that?
[09:35:50] <samholmes> How does AdBlock know just because there's the word ad or advertising in a resource that it's not essential to the functionality of the website?
[09:36:03] <Chuwiey> adblock is actually a bot that is there to annoy you, not anything else
[09:36:33] <Chuwiey> and the fact that it blocks it silently is even more annoying
[09:36:43] <Chuwiey> well, atleast that's working for you now
[09:39:20] <samholmes> Chuwiey: Maybe there's a way to check if AdBlock is being used, and if it is, ask the user to disable it for the site to function properly
[09:39:41] <Chuwiey> perhaps, check with the adblock site
[10:10:18] <jomofcw> I've got a problem with jQuery UI, is there a specific channel to ask ?
[10:12:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: just plain bored
[10:14:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: still there?
[10:18:40] <nicetry> Hey there, I believe a plugin I'm using requires that I pass it a 'node'.  if I have some random html as a string, how can I parse it into 'node's.  Right now when I do typeof $("<p>example</p>"), jquery tells me its an 'object'
[10:20:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> nicetry: this gets all text nodes: maybe worth looking into http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[10:21:21] <nicetry> Rohan_Bhangui: I'll give it a try
[10:21:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> well its not a solution
[10:21:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> its perhaps...what you need to understand node type
[10:21:50] * nicetry is smashing head against the ol' tinymce ICE-track-changes wall again
[10:22:07] <nicetry> Rohan_Bhangui: true I may just not be understanding what it wants
[10:22:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:22:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya best to understand what node is vs object
[10:22:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice try
[10:22:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9979172/difference-between-node-object-and-element-object
[10:22:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> nicetry: ^
[10:22:59] <nicetry> thanks!
[10:22:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> read the first line of marked solution
[10:24:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> nicetry: ^ in that stackoverflow link there is a wealth of info
[10:24:30] <nicetry> yeah that makes sense
[10:24:36] <nicetry> its less complicated than I thought
[10:24:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> yup
[10:24:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> all when you break it down
[10:24:50] <nicetry> but it also doesn't explain why ICE doesn't like what I pass it
[10:25:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> what you mean ICE?
[10:25:25] <nicetry> https://github.com/NYTimes/ice
[10:26:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> nicetry: very cool stuff
[10:26:45] <nicetry> s/cool/complicated
[10:27:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> nicetry: it could be very possible that a node is a parent
[10:27:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> single parent that is
[10:27:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> nicetry: here is what i mean: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/47837/getting-the-base-element-from-a-jquery-object
[10:28:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> nicetry: sry I timed out
[10:28:50] <nicetry> np
[10:28:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> so ya
[10:29:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> you can use .get(0);
[10:29:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> and use a selector
[10:29:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> as oppostie to html
[10:29:20] <nicetry> yeah I tried that, actually was on that SO page earlier
[10:29:23] <nicetry> in this case I'm attempting to insert a node, I thought the problem was that I was passing it the wrong thing
[10:29:33] <nicetry> because of jquery, so I came here. turns out that may not be the case
[10:30:03] <nicetry> I wish tinymce or ice had an irc channel but I couldn't find it
[10:30:16] <nicetry> or if I did, they were emptytown
[10:31:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:31:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya usually jquery guys are pretty resoruceful
[10:31:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> the channel may say #jquery
[10:32:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> but often you can find someone to explain the logic if they cant code it themselves
[10:32:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> nicetry: ^
[10:34:23] <nicetry> true enough
[10:57:49] <shoky> nicetry: if a plugin needs a node and not a jquery object, you can get the node with [0]
[10:58:04] <shoky> e.g. $("<p>example</p>")[0]
[10:58:47] <shoky> oh didnt see you got that solved, nm
[10:59:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky...lol
[11:00:49] <nicetry> shoky: problem is not solved, but it turns out jquery wasn't at fault
[11:01:15] <nicetry> The real problem is my bosses deciding to use software which has essentially no support
[11:01:44] <shoky> heh
[11:02:21] * nicetry pleads with the heavens that a tinymce/or/ICE guru will PM me at random and explain wtf is going on
[11:02:56] <shoky> well, you didn't post any code or error message
[11:03:22] <shoky> no idea what your current issue is
[11:03:55] <nicetry> shoky: its not an easy thing to replicate, sort of deep down in the code, I could put togeather an example but it would take some time.  I'd do it, as long as I could find someone who claimed to have messed with this stuff before
[11:04:23] <shoky> well you definitely won't get an answer for a question you've not asked
[11:04:39] <nicetry> True enough
[11:05:23] <shoky> and asking for topic experts is frowned upon :P
[11:05:32] <nicetry> Question: How does one insert HTML into a tinyMCE 3.x instance and have ICE notice the insert and mark it as a tracked change.
[11:18:05] <Soltis> I want a draggable div which keeps its position relative to the browser window when scrolling. .draggable() works for dragging, but I'm not sure how to make it keep the proper position.
[11:18:44] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/3VE3p/
[11:18:46] <adv_> i have one jquery lib that does gallery stuff with <img> tags in html. and i have this fiddle that has the js to handle zooming etc (image tile map). i want to combine the gallery with the 2nd script so that it can zoom in as well. the 2nd script has only one hardcoded image in the js portion (last line of the jsfiddle code). so i want to decouple the logic from there and be able to transfer it to html, so that i generate the <imgs>
[11:18:53] <adv_> anyone knows how to do this?
[11:20:20] <Nomikos> Soltis: you mean position: fixed; ?
[11:20:30] <Nomikos> *mean like
[11:20:38] <Soltis> Nomikos: Yeah, that sort of idea
[11:20:56] <Soltis> Nomikos: But of course setting position: fixed on the draggable div makes it disappear
[11:22:55] <Nomikos> Keeping in mind I suck at CSS and it's probably technically illegal for me to try to answer this question..,
[11:23:33] <Nomikos> if you go here http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/draggable/default.html and use webinspector to set the position of that draggable to fixed, and give the body a height of 800px or so, it seems to still work and behave as you describe
[11:24:12] <Nomikos> whether or not that means it's possible to do what you want in the context of your page and not using inspector, I don't know
[11:36:29] <shoky> nicetry: maybe this helps  http://jsfiddle.net/TgZXL/105/
[11:37:50] <nicetry> shoky: Thanks! its part of the way there
[11:38:00] <nicetry> one sec, let me get you to where I am at
[11:41:42] <nicetry> shoky:  http://jsfiddle.net/TgZXL/106/
[11:42:08] <nicetry> shoky: the issue is that I am getting html which has things like p's and spans in it, but when those are inserted, they arn't noticed by track changes
[11:43:23] <nicetry> shoky: I think what I might have to do is somehow create the p tags manually with editor.execCommand('mceInsertContent',true,'<p></p>'); then somehow set that new p tag as the range
[11:44:09] <nicetry> shoky: and insert each p tag as just its contained text with iceinsert into the p I created iva mceInsertContent.
[11:44:30] <nicetry> shoky: The only thing is I can't grasp how to create the range after I create the p tag.
[11:50:22] <nicetry> shoky: Do you see what I'm getting at?
[11:56:49] <ilteris> hey guys, why do I get an error on the console for this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/NKP4A/1/ I thought I escape it correctly
[11:57:00] <ilteris> I would appreciate any responses
[11:59:49] <shoky> nicetry: sortof.. i donno
[12:00:05] <nicetry> same :c - this is where I get stuck
[12:00:16] <nicetry> how does one insert html via iceinsert
[12:00:25] <nicetry> or
[12:00:43] <nicetry> how does one create an element in tinymce, then select that element with rangy
[12:00:50] <nicetry> https://code.google.com/p/rangy/wiki/RangyRange
[12:00:57] <nicetry> thats what I'm attempting to do now, but no luck yet
[12:03:55] <mahoski> ilteris: your html is in the js box, drop the j from $j, drop the <script></script>, tooltip() is not a jquery function, and you forgot to include jquery
[12:04:20] <shoky> ilteris: also your big string isn't closed
[12:04:28] <shoky> (you ended it with a \'  instead of a ' )
[12:04:44] <shoky> also $j is not jquery
[12:05:05] <shoky> ilteris: http://jsfiddle.net/NKP4A/2/
[12:05:08] <ilteris> sorry guys, I am a n00b
[12:05:46] <ilteris> shoky thanks for the correction, trying it now. appreciated.
[12:05:59] <ilteris> mahoski let me go and read about difference between j and $j
[12:06:18] <shoky> he said to drop the j, not drop the $
[12:06:18] <shoky> :P
[12:06:22] <nicetry> shoky: Thanks for your help + taking a shot at my issue.  I have to grab some food, if you have any sudden inspirations on the subject shoot me a pm
[12:06:26] <shoky> there's no such thing as $j
[12:06:46] <shoky> np nicetry. bon apetit
[12:07:15] <nicetry> shoky:  he could be doing something like $j = jQuery.noConflict()
[12:07:32] <nicetry> but in his code and not in his example, I didn't check either
[12:07:36] <nicetry> anyway later guys
[12:07:41] <shoky> nicetry: yes that's what i did in my correction fiddle. but there isn't such a thing in general
[12:07:51] <shoky> (and he asked why he was getting errors)
[12:08:02] <nicetry> indeed
[12:13:19] <jamieyg3> hi... using bootstrap 3... whats the best add-on to make a table sortable?
[12:15:58] <neataroni> im looking for a ui element that is like a horizontal row of dots (pips), and whichever one you currently select is indicated somehow
[12:29:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey all!
[12:36:21] <BillCriswell> neataroni: So you just need to highlight something that's clicked among its siblings?
[12:42:19] <timmaha> i'm having an issue with a sort function, but only in chrome. it's supposed to sort dates and it works in firefox but messes up at least 1 date in chrome http://pastebin.com/CbfQrgYd
[12:43:14] <timmaha> in ff, x and y start as jan and feb, and increment normally
[12:43:45] <timmaha> in chrome jan/dec comes in first, followed by jan/jul, mar/jan, nov/jan
[12:44:35] <shoky> timmaha: uhm sort functions don't return a boolean
[12:45:27] <shoky> also what's FormatDate.. make a jsfiddle
[12:46:56] <timmaha> oh FormatDateis something i wrote to handle dates coming in separated by / or -
[12:47:18] <shoky> well fix your sort function. and if you're still having problems, make a demo jsfiddle showing your issue
[12:48:08] <timmaha> if i knew how to fix my sort function, i wouldn't have come to irc for help :P
[12:48:12] <shoky> btw.. use console.log not alert. especially in a sort function ;\
[12:48:34] <timmaha> yea, i'm pretty new to JS and jquery. this code was in place before i got here
[12:48:45] <timmaha> it's been working the whole time though. and works perfectly in firefox
[12:49:21] <timmaha> ty for the console.log tip. will do
[12:49:39] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[12:51:05] <shoky> i suppose you want:  function(x, y) { return x - y; }
[12:52:45] <shoky> well donno, that's assuming x and y are numbers/timestamps
[12:53:32] <timmaha> no you're right
[12:53:36] <timmaha> that was exactly it
[12:53:38] <timmaha> thanks a bunch
[13:57:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you around?
[14:04:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: might i bother you for something
[14:06:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: might i bother you for something
[14:06:39] <BillCriswell> I like this fake Friday thing going on righ tnow.
[14:06:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[14:06:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: might i get some assistance
[14:07:44] <BillCriswell> Perhaps. It really depends how quickly I can wrap my head around it haha
[14:07:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i built a repo: and the issue im having si the link color I have given is not working
[14:07:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> https://github.com/rohanbhangui/frontend
[14:07:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats the repo
[14:08:52] <BillCriswell> Rohan_Bhangui: The a:not(.button) part?
[14:08:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[14:09:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> if you look at the styling for *
[14:09:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have color: #484848
[14:09:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> but that will get overwritten right since a:not(.button)
[14:09:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> is further down the css
[14:10:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: i even tried to put !important on the .a:not(.button) css
[14:11:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> *a:not(.button)
[14:11:09] <BillCriswell> Rohan_Bhangui: * { color: #whatever } might be catching more than you expect.
[14:11:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> well I need it as a default to
[14:11:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> *so
[14:11:39] <BillCriswell> If you have a demo page open it up, inspect the element and on the right you should see what styles are happenening where and why.
[14:12:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay thanks
[14:13:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait a sec
[14:13:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: a visited link should flash red when clicked on right?
[14:14:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: got it....turns out it does work the :active needed to be :visisted:active
[14:14:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> *visited
[14:15:00] <BillCriswell> Yeah.You didn't specify it was for visited links while they were being clicked.
[14:15:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> k thanks
[14:16:05] <BillCriswell> Glad you got it, though!
[14:24:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> can you set the min-width of a link?
[14:24:51] <obert> Rohan_Bhangui: min-width works only on block elements
[14:25:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> damn
[14:27:09] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: yes you can
[14:27:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: really
[14:27:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsfiddle
[14:27:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have a link
[14:27:31] <Cork> a { display: inline-block; min-width: 50%; }
[14:27:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> that looks like a button
[14:27:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[14:29:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: thanks
[14:45:00] <skullcrasher> hey there
[14:45:07] <skullcrasher> i just found this slider http://jsbin.com/uqovih/381/edit
[14:45:24] <skullcrasher> but i want to make it working for multiple sliders on one page
[14:46:25] <skullcrasher> if I use classes this doesn't seem to work
[14:46:34] <skullcrasher> would it be easier to transform into a plugin?
[14:46:45] <Cork> skullcrasher: are you talking about a slider or a slideshow?
[14:47:11] <skullcrasher> slideshow i guess, as it is not meant to work like the jquery ui slider
[14:47:33] <Cork> ya, that's a slideshow
[14:47:36] <skullcrasher> ah ok
[14:48:01] <skullcrasher> for now, if i replace class with ids all slideshows are animating
[14:48:05] <Cork> skullcrasher: well replace the id's with classes
[14:48:17] <Cork> and base it on a container for the slideshow
[14:48:20] <skullcrasher> no matte what prev/next button i click
[14:48:21] <Cork> and it should work
[14:48:58] <Cork> uh, wait it stores global variables
[14:49:02] <skullcrasher> the thing here is that this slideshows are each inside a jquery according content area :)
[14:49:24] <skullcrasher> yes, that is what i try to figure out, to make the global variable local so it works indepent from each other
[14:49:40] <skullcrasher> i just thought about trying to put this into a plugin
[14:50:00] <skullcrasher> so i can then use it like ('.container-class').myplugin();
[14:50:02] <Cork> it can be done with alsmot only css though
[14:50:26] <Cork> css3 is needed for the animation though (if you don't use js)
[14:51:00] <skullcrasher> this code snippet uses jquery.animate for animation
[14:51:07] <Cork> ya
[14:51:23] <Cork> it's quite js heavy in other regards too
[14:51:28] <skullcrasher> yes
[14:52:14] <skullcrasher> it works quite nice as it is, but only for one slideshow :)
[14:52:34] <skullcrasher> do you think it would be difficult to put into a jquery plugin?
[14:52:46] <skullcrasher> at least the js part
[14:59:17] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/4P758ZBX
[14:59:24] <vacho> what am I doing wrong? isn't that the same thing?
[15:00:55] <shoky> vacho: no. you have to use getJSON's callback or call .done on it and pass a callback
[15:01:11] <vacho> shoky: ok i will try
[15:01:23] <shoky> also you can't do that for a 3rd-party domain unless they allow it
[15:01:58] <vacho> it's my own domain
[15:02:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[15:03:26] <vacho> shoky: http://pastie.org/8513461
[15:03:27] <vacho> what about tha
[15:03:28] <vacho> t
[15:03:59] <shoky> vacho: it's good except for the "var pageviews = "
[15:04:10] <shoky> ajax is asynchronous, you'll have to access the data in a callback only
[15:04:24] <vacho> tell me more
[15:04:25] <shoky> you can't synchronously put the result in a variable like that
[15:05:00] <vacho> ok works
[15:05:03] <vacho> i put it inside callback!
[15:05:03] <shoky> nothing to tell, you've got the .done(...) part right. do what you want in the callback
[15:05:05] <shoky> ;p
[15:09:42] <skullcrasher> Cork: this is what i tried to put into the plugin http://goodtime.indus.uberspace.de/filebin/index.php/wDu7dq/js
[15:10:15] <skullcrasher> works with classes now, but still doesn't change the slideshows independently
[15:10:40] <skullcrasher> looks like the variables like counter are still global or something
[15:11:00] <Cork> skullcrasher: this is the list of matched elements
[15:11:33] <Cork> you need to .each loop this so you run the code once for each block
[15:11:50] <Cork> (or modify it to not use to many variables)
[15:12:01] <skullcrasher> ah ok
[15:12:06] <skullcrasher> im just reading this: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[15:14:10] <skullcrasher> wow nice
[15:14:13] <skullcrasher> thx Cork
[15:14:25] <skullcrasher> was much easier than expected to put this into a plugin
[15:14:40] <skullcrasher> maybe not the best code :D but it works
[15:16:10] <nicetry> shoky: I got that thing to work, with a ton of js gymnastics
[15:23:49] <nicetry> shoky: Thanks for your help again
[15:23:51] <nicetry> later folks
[15:25:55] <quick> saludos, el canal es en ingles o español
[15:26:49] <louism2wash> hey guys, is there a good way to detect whether or not you are overlapping another dom element when you are adding elements to the dom?  I am trying to give the user the option of adding form fields that then automatically push do the fields below.  Thanks.
[15:46:14] <tehopeologist> sup all
[15:46:43] <tehopeologist> can someone point me in the right direction to a simple .ajax() tutorial or something for adding a number to a column ?
[15:46:47] <tehopeologist> in a mysql db?
[15:47:04] <tehopeologist> i'm trying to make a "like" system (sortof) like facebook, but with favorites
[15:47:26] <tehopeologist> and i need to push the id of the image to the user's column for favorites
[15:47:38] <tehopeologist> i've just never used .ajax() before
[15:49:31] <ColKurtz> tehopeologist do you have your backend built?
[15:49:36] <tehopeologist> yes
[15:49:45] <ColKurtz> what request do you need to make?
[15:49:59] <tehopeologist> basically an insert into
[15:50:06] <ColKurtz> no what HTTP request
[15:50:11] <tehopeologist> oh, sorry ummmm
[15:50:16] <tehopeologist> i'm not 100% sure?
[15:50:26] <tehopeologist> as in post or get?
[15:50:30] <ColKurtz> yes
[15:50:31] <tehopeologist> or like 200 etf
[15:50:37] <tehopeologist> post most likely
[15:50:46] <tehopeologist> it's not going to add to the url onclick
[15:56:12] <ColKurtz> tehopeologist something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/VUpXU/
[15:56:24] <tehopeologist> checkins
[15:57:33] <ColKurtz> tehopeologist that would be functionally equivalent to a  <form method="post" action="/path/to/url"> <input name="key" value="value" />
[15:57:42] <tehopeologist> yeah i see that
[15:57:53] <tehopeologist> i guess i'd need to make a separate .php file for the action
[15:58:06] <tehopeologist> that connects to the db, then has an insert if conditional for if the user's logged in
[15:58:13] <tehopeologist> am i on the right track in that thought process?
[15:58:18] <ColKurtz> yep
[15:58:21] <tehopeologist> hmms okay
[15:59:31] <tehopeologist> thanks for the help man, i'm gonna try to tackle this now
[15:59:31] <tehopeologist> :D
[15:59:33] <tehopeologist> later!
[16:50:38] <Steven_F> Oh
[16:50:41] <Steven_F> THis exists
[16:50:49] <Steven_F> Can someone help me with hide and show?
[16:54:28] <duch_kazatel> Steven_F depends - what's the issue?
[16:54:33] <Steven_F> IDK
[16:54:45] <Steven_F> document.getElementById("invalid-tld-callout").show();
[16:54:47] <Steven_F> Is that invalid?
[16:54:56] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[16:55:13] <duch_kazatel> you need to call show() on a jQuery object.
[16:55:35] <duch_kazatel> $("#invalid-tld-callout").show();
[16:56:03] <Steven_F> Let me try
[16:57:55] <Steven_F> It's not working.
[16:58:26] <duch_kazatel> does #invalid-tld-callout exist on the page?
[16:58:35] <duch_kazatel> is there an actual element with that ID?
[16:58:44] <duch_kazatel> rather, a node with that ID?
[16:58:49] <Steven_F> There is an element
[16:58:58] <Steven_F> <div id="invalid-tld-callout" class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger hidden">
[16:59:00] <Steven_F> ....
[16:59:02] <Steven_F> </div>
[16:59:17] <duch_kazatel> and there is only one with that ID, right?
[16:59:21] <Steven_F> Yeah
[16:59:39] <duch_kazatel> go to the console and try running $('#invalid-tld-callout')
[16:59:40] <Steven_F> And it's performing the function (I threw in an alert right after the .show())
[16:59:41] <duch_kazatel> what happens?
[17:00:30] <skullcrasher> does developer console tell you anything?
[17:00:32] <Steven_F> <div id="invalid-tld-callout" class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger hidden" style="display: block;">
[17:00:32] <Steven_F> ...
[17:00:32] <Steven_F>     </div>
[17:00:44] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:00:51] <duch_kazatel> you need to remove the hidden class.
[17:00:58] <duch_kazatel> 5bucks says that's your problem.
[17:01:03] <Steven_F> But then how do I hide it? (That is my problem)
[17:01:25] <duch_kazatel> try using .removeClass("hidden"); instead.
[17:01:39] <duch_kazatel> or set an inline style for display: none;
[17:01:40] <aerth> style display:none
[17:01:50] <duch_kazatel> iirc hide just applies display: none; to the element.
[17:02:16] <duch_kazatel> and .show() removes that style.
[17:02:48] <Steven_F> <div id="invalid-tld-callout" class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger" style="display: none;">
[17:02:52] <Steven_F> How about that?
[17:02:56] <duch_kazatel> sure, start there.
[17:03:17] <duch_kazatel> i prefer using addClass() and removeClass() and controlling that with a given class, but your method will work, too.
[17:03:34] <Steven_F> Yeah
[17:03:35] <Steven_F> That works
[17:03:48] <Steven_F> I thought show() and hide() are soft entrances
[17:03:59] <duch_kazatel> "soft entrances"?
[17:04:04] <Steven_F> They slide in
[17:04:18] <Steven_F> slideDown()
[17:04:31] <duch_kazatel> show and hide simply show and hide an element./
[17:05:10] <duch_kazatel> slideDown() and slideUp() do as advertised.
[17:06:05] <Steven_F> Awesome!
[17:06:10] <Steven_F> Thanks, that's what I was looking for. :)
[17:06:41] <duch_kazatel> np.  glad we could help.
[17:26:42] <Steven_F> How can I check if an element is currently shown or hidden?
[17:31:50] <duch_kazatel> Steven_F that depends - are you going by the style?
[17:31:56] <Steven_F> Umm
[17:31:57] <Steven_F> Yeah
[17:32:15] <Steven_F>  style="display: none;"
[17:32:20] <duch_kazatel> there are a few ways.
[17:32:40] <duch_kazatel> $(element).is(":visible")
[17:32:44] <duch_kazatel> is one way
[17:32:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> whats up #jquery :) ?
[17:33:02] <Steven_F> What about toggle("slow")
[17:33:08] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:33:49] <duch_kazatel> toggle will flip the display property.
[17:34:02] <Steven_F> $(element).is(":visible")
[17:34:04] <Steven_F> returns t or f/
[17:34:09] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[17:34:24] <duch_kazatel> i'd reccommend explicitly hiding or showing.
[17:36:38] <Steven_F> Aaaaaaand everything stopped working. Lol
[17:36:49] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[17:36:56] <duch_kazatel> because there are two versions of toggle.
[17:39:51] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i leave. enjoy.
[17:40:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> huh?
[17:46:57] <Eagle5> hey guys i have a problem where i need to display rows of information from a csv file by searching through them and calling the ones that match the users request and displaying the information instantiously instead of having to wait to load all the rows
[17:47:30] <Eagle5> how would i go about doing that?
[17:53:20] <shoky> Eagle5: you can try using a plugin like datatables or jqGrid
[17:55:51] <Eagle5> are those dealing with tables?
[17:57:25] <shoky> yah
[17:57:41] <Eagle5> thing is shoky dealing with the data is not hard
[17:57:53] <Eagle5> its just using php to display the information instantiously
[17:58:03] <Eagle5> im not displaying the info in a table format
[17:58:43] <shoky> you gave a very general question, i can only give you a very general answer
[17:58:59] <Eagle5> yeah sorry
[17:59:10] <Eagle5> do u know a way?
[17:59:26] <shoky> that's an even more general question
[17:59:39] <Eagle5> lmao
[17:59:57] <Eagle5> do u want me to elaborate?
[18:00:13] <shoky> i'm ok either way ;]
[18:00:23] <Eagle5> lol kk so
[18:00:30] <Ittabraga> If you want php to be instantaneous, you should turn bulimic.
[18:00:39] <Eagle5> i have 6 files full of data in csv format
[18:00:41] <Ittabraga> php is so slow I vomit
[18:00:45] <Eagle5> and they have to stay in that format
[18:01:00] <Ittabraga> but, it's so quick to punch out, it's second nature.
[18:01:02] <Eagle5> so on the front end the user will choose for example choose Female or Male
[18:01:23] <Eagle5> and im tyring to use php to grab every male person in the table for example
[18:01:42] <Eagle5> and display each male it finds instantly on the front end
[18:02:34] <shoky> do you know how to do ajax?
[18:02:36] <Ittabraga> why can't it be imported into a db.  using SQL smokes php in sorting
[18:02:51] <scrici> http://pastebin.com/Xyfjb4Lw
[18:02:52] <scrici> need some help
[18:02:57] <scrici> look at poolingloop function
[18:03:20] <Eagle5> Ittabraga, if i were to use SQL i would have to run the query everytime the program runs
[18:03:29] <Eagle5> and i have to do the sorting algorithms myself
[18:03:43] <shoky> scrici: you're in #jquery
[18:03:58] <Eagle5> i know how to do those its just the problem with displaying the infromation instantly
[18:04:02] <Eagle5> as it finds the info
[18:04:10] <Eagle5> instead of the algorithm hanging till it finishes
[18:06:06] <Ittabraga> as shoky said, use ajax, and use an algorithm that may be slower, but will provide answers as they come instead of all at once.
[18:06:24] <Eagle5> alright thanks a lot Ittabraga and shoky
[18:12:10] <jak2000> hi all
[18:14:14] <jak2000> hi all! i have a question i have 2 divs 1 left(here i display a vertical menu) and other on the right (here when user click on a option of the menu, display a html) how do it? i have tis http://pastebin.com/QDrNUyfd   lines 56 to 59 not work (not load the html webpage) any advice?
[18:17:27] <ahhughes> to set focus all I need todo is this right? $('#printWindow #txtTitle').focus();
[18:18:46] <ahhughes> seems to not work, maybe it fires the event but it certainly doesnt set the cursor on that input, which is what I want.
[18:24:19] <__equinox> hey guys
[18:24:30] <__equinox> total noob question
[18:24:33] <__equinox> why does this not work
[18:24:34] <__equinox> $('.shop-items li img').on('click', function(event) {
[18:25:08] <__equinox> i wanted to capture click event on an img inside a li which has a ul of class shop-items
[18:35:09] <ahhughes> $('#printWindow #txtTitle').show(); works
[18:35:15] <ahhughes> $('#printWindow #txtTitle').hide(); works
[18:35:23] <ahhughes> $('#printWindow #txtTitle').focus(); does nothing :/
[18:35:53] <ahhughes> anyone got any suggestions?
[18:36:41] <whitby> ahhughes: (Sorta unrelated) Why the double IDs?
[18:37:03] <ahhughes> spose I dont need them
[18:37:29] <whitby> You should only need the one. `#txtTitle` should be unique.
[18:38:01] <ahhughes> yeah, still get the same result tho.
[18:38:42] <whitby> What kind of element is it?
[18:52:32] <__equinox> can anyone tell me why $('.shop-items li img' ) gives me null
[18:52:40] <__equinox> is this an invalid selector?
[18:53:58] <shoky> __equinox: it's fine. make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[18:55:51] <whitby> __equinox: (I know it sounds obvious, but) are you sure that the selector is correct?
[18:56:09] <__equinox> I typed in $('.shop-items li') in my console and it shows the img
[18:56:14] <__equinox> but the on click is not responding
[18:57:02] <whitby> __equinox: I 2nd the request for a reduced test case (jsFiddle)
[19:03:11] <Steven_F>     <div id="whois-callout" class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" style="display: none;" onclick="whois()">
[19:03:19] <Steven_F> That should be executing the whois function, right?
[19:03:28] <Steven_F> Ohh
[19:03:33] <Steven_F> I see my problem
[19:03:35] <Steven_F> LOL
[19:05:31] <Steven_F> <input type="checkbox" name="whois" id="whois" onclick="whois()">
[19:05:46] <Steven_F> That should be be executing the WHOIS function, right?
[19:06:09] <Steven_F> When clicked
[19:10:28] <shoky> Steven_F: only if it's global. using onclick attributes it not recommended generally
[19:10:54] <Steven_F> Well, I need a popup to happen when this button is clicked. What is recommended, shoky?
[19:11:27] <shoky> Steven_F: adding the event handlers in javascript, e.g. $('#whois').on('click', function() { ... })
[19:11:40] <Steven_F> Oh
[19:13:26] <Steven_F> Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function
[19:13:46] <Steven_F> http://pastebin.com/b9nTfHen
[19:13:53] <Steven_F> Any idea why I'm getting that?
[19:14:05] <shoky> yes, you didn't do what i said properly
[19:14:10] <Steven_F> GRsdasdjd
[19:14:27] <shoky> try  a bit harder before asking
[19:14:49] <whitby> Steven_F: Do you have jQuery on the page?

[23:14:03] <nights> hi
[23:14:19] <nights> how do i print the following json data in the correct order
[23:14:19] <nights> {"result_set":{"00":"","10":"","20":"","30":"selected","40":"","50":""}}
[23:15:34] <nights> when using each, the "00" tuple come out last
[23:30:19] <grafi> nights javascript doesnt guarantee property order in objects, thats what arrays are for
[23:33:57] <d8bhatta> Hello guys...change event is already implemented on base/core files. I need to call change event on custom page for same input field which has already got change event by default
[23:35:20] <d8bhatta> E.g i have email  field...email validation is already carried on by prototype js lib...i need to call another change event before prototype js code is trigered
[23:36:27] <Jacta> Is there a way to fetch two last numbers from string?
[23:38:51] <d8bhatta> Jacta: you can use substring
[23:38:59] <Jacta> and just -2?
[23:39:22] <Cork> you want the two last char codes or what number are you talking about?
[23:40:06] <Jacta> I think actually that the string always ends with numbers actually :)
[23:40:28] <Cork> so you want all the last number characters from the string?
[23:40:46] <d8bhatta> Jacta: you can get total lenght of the string  like str.substring( count(str)-2,2);
[23:41:07] <Cork> js> print(JSON.stringify("skdfhksdghf12312356".match(/[0-9]+$/)))
[23:41:12] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[23:41:25] * Cork kicks b-ot
[23:41:40] <Jacta> I just want last two characters actually, string.substring(-2)?
[23:41:59] <Cork> should work
[23:42:14] <Cork> js> print("skdfhksdghf12312356".substring(-2))
[23:42:18] <b-ot> Cork: skdfhksdghf12312356
[23:42:22] <Cork> ah
[23:42:30] <Jacta> :\
[23:42:40] <Cork> one sec
[23:42:55] <Cork> js> print("skdfhksdghf12312356".substr(-2))
[23:43:00] <b-ot> Cork: 56
[23:43:11] <Jacta> aah :p
[23:52:35] <dwarder> i have a SPA app, each time i undate it a user has to clear it's browser cache are there solutions to this problem?
[23:52:56] <dwarder> SPA = single page application
[23:54:41] <grafi> busting cache with querystrings?
[23:55:05] <dwarder> grafi: what do you mean?
[23:55:36] <grafi> like appending ?v=0.1 to the files
[23:56:07] <grafi> the querystring changes when you update something, and the browser downloads the new file
[23:56:07] <dwarder> grafi: in script tags?
[23:56:16] <grafi> yeah
[23:56:28] <dwarder> i.e.  <script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[23:56:34] <dwarder> i.e.  <script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js?v1"></script>
[23:56:42] <dwarder> grafi: awesome solution, thank you
[23:57:08] <grafi> well its not really an awesome solution because i have yet to find a good way to automate that :P
[23:57:13] <grafi> but it works at least :p
