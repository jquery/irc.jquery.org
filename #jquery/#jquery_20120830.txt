[00:02:43] <dark-sun> guys, do you have any idea about this http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1175275/
[00:02:52] <dark-sun> i'm using firebug to see the result
[00:06:07] <DivInt> mazzachre: Rephrase - Its a single page website using jquery to show/hide content layers with transition effects for navigation. I have set the # inpage links too for navigation when javascript isnt available. How does one make the navigation links bookmarkable? Have tried a few things but its not working. Thanks for your help man
[00:20:08] <merlin1978> This is the   index.html = http://pastie.org/4614929  and   mydialog.htm = http://pastie.org/4614930     When I load index.html and click outside html link, it will load mydialog.htm inside a colorbox I get  TypeError: $(".tooltips").qtip is not a function
[00:20:16] <merlin1978> ANy inputs how to fix it?
[00:20:30] <merlin1978> Maybe dynamically load the js
[00:21:36] <Koopz> i wonder why there is no widget-thing for those move-left-move-right-position-up-position-down-list-thingies...
[00:26:40] <wachpwnski> I cant catch and prevent the event of a $(#form).submit()
[00:28:43] <dsdeiz> hi! say i have a textfield where the value increments every second, how would i store the latest value when a user refreshes the page?
[00:29:23] <wachpwnski> In a session?
[00:29:57] <wachpwnski> Are you trying to do a download manager?
[00:30:53] <dsdeiz> nope. it's like a fee for a product that increases every second when a user presses a button. problem is i dunno how to store the latest value of that fee when the user refreshes the page
[00:31:45] <wachpwnski> That is not a good practice :/
[00:31:50] <wachpwnski> They can just no script it
[00:32:23] <dsdeiz> hm, perhaps it's better if i just compare the times in the server side?
[00:32:30] <dsdeiz> time elapsed
[00:32:34] <wachpwnski> I would say use $.get and $.post
[00:32:40] <wachpwnski> $.get on document load
[00:33:26] <wachpwnski> store it in a session maybe
[00:34:11] <dsdeiz> yeah but i dunno how to store it before refresh

[01:04:36] <obert-> isnt there auofocus in jquery?
[01:04:49] <obert-> or just .focus?
[01:06:34] <narkeeso> what is the best method to only execute code when a dynamically created element has been inserted into the DOM?
[01:06:39] <narkeeso> i run into this issue all the time
[01:07:12] <narkeeso> without the use of setTimeout or intervals
[01:08:28] <blackspotwiggins> $("#asd").append(); executecode();
[01:08:38] <blackspotwiggins> as simple as it gets
[01:12:01] <narkeeso> blackspotwiggins: i have something similar to that - https://gist.github.com/9b16197140f97c97170a
[01:12:13] <narkeeso> i have to wrap my trigger in a timeout
[01:12:20] <narkeeso> otherwise
[01:12:30] <blackspotwiggins> why?
[01:12:47] <blackspotwiggins> you can use timeout with 0 delay
[01:13:00] <blackspotwiggins> if you rely on some other execution being done
[01:13:13] <blackspotwiggins> or if you use underscore, there's _.delay
[01:14:21] <narkeeso> yeah tree_on[id].append() is adding a bunch of elements to a container
[01:14:31] <narkeeso> i guess that is still running by the time the trigger executes
[01:14:35] <blackspotwiggins> ehh i meant _.defer
[01:14:36] <narkeeso> so i'm not able to see anything in the DOM
[01:21:58] <diverdude> Hello, if i get a bunch of nodes back like this: $('.dirtab') how do i gain access to just the first node?
[01:25:35] <wachpwnski> diverdude: selectors?
[01:26:13] <wachpwnski> http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[01:27:02] <diverdude> thx
[01:32:25] <Cork> wachpwnski, diverdude: its normally better to use the function calls instead of the selectors
[01:32:30] <Cork> so .first()
[01:32:49] <Cork> the :<function name> calls the same function, but in a more round about way
[01:32:53] <obert-> sorry. is this correct? $(document).ready( function(){ $('input[tabindex=1]').focus(function () { $(this).fadeIn(); }); });
[01:33:32] <Cork> obert-: how do you think you could focus an element thats not visible?
[01:33:54] <obert-> why shouldnt be visibile?
[01:34:00] <wachpwnski> Cork, how do i reload a modal to it's orinal stated view after submission?
[01:34:05] <Cork> cause your fading it in?
[01:34:21] <obert-> then perhaps it isnt what i want
[01:34:21] <Cork> wachpwnski: a modal what?
[01:34:48] <Cork> obert-: faceIn animates from the current opacity to 1
[01:34:52] <Cork> 'fadeIn
[01:34:57] <obert-> i would just to get an effect to improve autofocus/focus on the input with tabindex 1
[01:35:07] <Cork> fadeOut fades from the current opacity to 0 and sets display: none
[01:35:22] <Cork> ?.animate @ obert-
[01:35:23] <bot-t> obert-, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[01:35:33] <Cork> then you can set what you want to animate to
[01:35:38] <obert-> i saw animate..but
[01:35:42] <Cork> and what to animate
[01:36:09] <obert-> i would just to change background-color on :focus i assume
[01:36:17] <blackspotwiggins> use css
[01:36:24] <obert-> it isnt enought seems
[01:36:29] <blackspotwiggins> ???
[01:36:33] <wachpwnski> Cork I have a modal dialog, it loads a form to submit, I use ajax to post. On close I want to refresh it
[01:36:38] <obert-> got an input with html5 autofocus too
[01:36:48] <blackspotwiggins> css is not enough to change background?
[01:36:52] <obert-> CSS arent enought to style input:focus:)
[01:37:03] <obert-> seems so
[01:37:04] <blackspotwiggins> how so?
[01:37:06] <Cork> wachpwnski: how do you set the content of the dialog to start with?
[01:37:19] <Cork> uh...
[01:37:27] <obert-> anyway i got jquery..why dont try to find an usable effect using it?:P
[01:37:31] <wachpwnski> let me paste it somewhere
[01:37:36] <Cork> input:focus can style the elements background
[01:37:39] <seutje> wachpwnski, Cork: to back up the :first thing: http://jsperf.com/css-vs-method
[01:37:47] <blackspotwiggins> obert-, http://jsfiddle.net/zFMPf/
[01:38:26] <seutje> (only use rewrap if you don't need any meta-data)
[01:38:31] <obert-> i got that css already blackice2999|afk.
[01:38:35] <obert-> blackspotwiggins
[01:38:39] <blackspotwiggins> so what's the problem?
[01:38:45] <blackice2999|afk> obert-: ? huh ?
[01:39:19] <obert-> sorry blackice2999|afk
[01:39:20] <Cork> seutje: damn, rewrappern i didn't predict
[01:39:30] <seutje> INORITE?
[01:39:33] <blackice2999|afk> obert-: no problem ;)
[01:39:35] <wachpwnski> Cork:  https://gist.github.com/304726224e8748215328
[01:39:46] <seutje> it actually makes sense, as it doesn't try to keep the .selector stuff
[01:39:57] <obert-> blackspotwiggins: i would to find a decent jquery effect to improve usability in my form, since i'm using already html5 autofocus:p
[01:40:06] <blackspotwiggins> what freaking effect
[01:40:19] <blackspotwiggins> effects should ont "improve usability"
[01:40:23] <obert-> i'm not creative atm
[01:40:30] <Cork> wachpwnski: ok, so your filling the dialog with .load, you need to do it again if you want a "refresh"
[01:40:50] <obert-> if you highlight that input that is focused, for example, it improves usability
[01:40:50] <nVee> hey guys, is anyone familiar with this plugin, http://quasipartikel.at/multiselect/? I have mine implimented but looking for a way that I can clear all the selected values with a click event for a reset button outside of the multiselect box?
[01:41:10] <blackspotwiggins> obert-, and that's a jquery effect??
[01:41:21] <obert-> mah could be. why not?
[01:41:33] <blackspotwiggins> ah fuck this, im out
[01:41:40] <obert-> what are you using jquery for?
[01:41:47] <obert-> ...
[01:42:33] <wachpwnski> Cork, how do i call that exactly? in cancel function, do I just do $(this).load()
[01:42:33] <wachpwnski> ?
[01:42:34] <obert-> sorry.
[01:43:05] <se-lite_> obert-: jquery is more or less a javascript wrapper library. You use jquery to write javascript that will work cross platform without thinking too much on how it deals with the different problems i each browser...
[01:44:10] <obert-> se-lite_: js isnt used to improve usability?
[01:44:56] <se-lite_> obert-: Yes.. And feet can be used to walk with..
[01:45:18] <obert-> then what's wrong with mine question
[01:45:47] <se-lite_> erm, let me rephrase: js is a language where you can make happends.. Improve usability, make a game etc
[01:46:49] <se-lite_> obert-: what you want to do is to set given styles/css-classes on a input, based on the element state. You can fairly simple use javascript/jquery to do that
[01:47:27] <xec_> obert-: i'm just jumping in here, havent read the discussion entirely - but my guess would be that the point is: don't do something in jQuery that css does (better)
[01:49:52] <xec_> obert-: "improving usability" is very abstract - noone can tell what specifically you are trying to do. If you want to change presentation of a form field based on its focused state, css surely is the way to go.
[01:50:26] <VagaStorm> if I have @media screen and (max-width: 720px) in my css, is it posible to change a value in just that scope?
[01:52:32] <blackspotwiggins> VagaStorm, if (document.documentElement.clientWidth < 720) {}
[01:52:45] <obert-> ok people, i'll think about something
[01:53:24] <obert-> i'm not creative at all atm
[01:54:17] <obert-> thanks
[01:55:33] <VagaStorm> using $("somelement").css("attr", value) dos not work since it wil set the main scope, while the @media screen and (max-width: 720px) overrides it somehow. preferably, $("somelement").css("attr") should return or sett the curent scope
[01:57:12] <seutje> VagaStorm: jQuery doesn't touch the actually css, but only adds inline stuff
[01:57:53] <seutje> VagaStorm: so if you want just that scope, u'll prolly have to dump a style block with the media query and everything, although I'm pretty sure there's a plugin that helps with this, somewhere
[02:01:05] <VagaStorm> doh... I'm sorry, I figured it out. it dos actualy work that way I whanted it to. if your page is less than 720 it will change the value in that scope, and not the other
[02:04:18] <nVee> hey guys, I am trying to remove the selected attribute from my select box options, but it does not work, I am using $("#selectboxselector option").removeAttr("selected");
[02:05:51] <BebopSteve> Anyone know of a good jquery beginner's tutorial coming from php?  I've been putting it off too long
[02:08:36] <nVee> hey guys, I am trying to remove the selected attribute from my select box options, but it does not work, I am using $("#selectboxselector option").removeAttr("selected");
[02:08:44] <jac0bz1> Morning (Or night, depending on location :)) I have 20 <select /> elements on a page, all with the same name " attendee[group][] " and containing the same values. Is there a way to check that at value can only occur maximum four time.. So <select /> 1,2,3 and 4 can have the same value selected, but then any of the other <select /> would not be able to choose this value
[02:09:08] <jac0bz1> Hope I made my question clear, did't know how else to write it
[02:09:13] <jac0bz1> :)
[02:14:34] <jacta> Hi all :)
[02:14:34] <enoch> hji all
[02:14:51] <enoch> how to get the container(object) of a clicked element?
[02:15:22] <NodeX> parent()
[02:15:28] <NodeX> or parents() for higher level
[02:15:29] <enoch> NodeX doesn't works
[02:15:33] <NodeX> it works fine
[02:16:15] <enoch> http://pastebin.com/MTqRn2Uj
[02:17:02] <NodeX> parent() is the FIRST parent
[02:17:08] <NodeX> ?parent
[02:17:09] <bot-t> .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[02:17:33] <enoch> so?
[02:17:47] <rosieres> is there a simple way in jquery to start a download of an image instead of showing it - if it´s linked with an <a>
[02:18:09] <NodeX> so ... console.log($(this).parent());
[02:22:50] <enoch> NodeX: it works thanks? i think it was keeping the "get" function as "this"
[02:23:35] <NodeX> the scope changes
[02:23:52] <NodeX> and you should cache your element .... var element=$(this); <---- the clicked item
[02:23:59] <NodeX> then you can use element.parent()....
[02:26:21] <seutje> rosieres: creating an img element with a src attr will start the download, even if it's not injected into the DOM yet (afaik)
[02:27:20] <Anticom> hi all
[02:27:39] <Anticom> i'm looking for a tooltip plugin similar to prototip but with free usage in commercial projects
[02:27:45] <seutje> all together now: hi Anticom!
[02:27:59] <Anticom> hehe hi seutje :) any recommendations? :P
[02:28:45] <seutje> ?g qtip2 @ Anticom
[02:28:50] <seutje> haven't used it in forever though
[02:28:56] <bot-t> seutje, No results found for 'qtip2'.
[02:28:57] <seutje> no more ?g ? :(
[02:29:00] <seutje> oh
[02:29:06] <seutje> Anticom: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/
[02:29:18] <Anticom> can google myself, thanks ;P
[02:29:21] <Anticom> :D
[02:29:36] <seutje> it's not the most lightweight out there, but it's pretty feature-rich
[02:29:54] <seutje> if you care deeply about performance, there's probably a better (lighter) solution out there
[02:29:59] <Anticom> wow, this one looks pretty sexy :O
[02:30:21] <Anticom> seutje i just need ajax loading and it should look good, that's all there is to it for me :)
[02:31:09] <seutje> oh snap, it has custom builds now :o
[02:31:26] <Anticom> just curious not all demos seem to work
[02:32:17] <wachpwnski> can I pass a functions event to another function ?
[02:32:30] <DarsVaeda> can I display in the console (firebug) what code is bind to a click event for an element?
[02:32:31] <Anticom> what you mean by passing an event to another function?
[02:32:32] <rosieres> seutje: <a href="img.jpg" title="foo" target="_blank" class="download">Download </a> -> what should I create from this ? I Don´t get it ;-)
[02:32:53] <Anticom> DarsVaeda there's a firebug plugin called firequery which does exactly that
[02:33:01] <wachpwnski> I got it
[02:33:02] <DarsVaeda> thanks
[02:33:09] <seutje> Anticom: check the console, it's unable to locate the content of the tooltip, so it isn't rendering them
[02:33:22] <Anticom> "$.curCSS is not a function"
[02:33:41] <Anticom> no it is rendering them seutje but the demo code seems somewhat incorrect / messy
[02:33:48] <Anticom> i'm just going to dl it and try it myself
[02:34:02] <Anticom> as long as it works for me i don't care about all the fancy other features ;)
[02:34:25] <seutje> rosieres: $('.download').each(function() { $('<img />', {src: this.href}); }); or something?
[02:34:40] <rosieres> seutje: ahh . . .k thanks
[02:35:06] <seutje> Anticom: looks like there's an excess "/" in one of the selectors it uses
[02:35:39] <Anticom> yea, also thinking it's more like the demo code then the plugin itself
[02:38:23] <jac0bz1> Morning (Or night, depending on location :)) I have 20 <select /> elements on a page, all with the same name " attendee[group][] " and containing the same values. Is there a way to check that at value can only occur maximum four time.. So <select /> 1,2,3 and 4 can have the same value selected, but then any of the other <select /> would not be able to choose this value
[02:38:27] <jac0bz1> Hope I made my question clear, did't know how else to write it
[02:39:13] <Anticom> jac0bz1 so do the elements having the same value have to be next to each other?
[02:39:50] <jac0bz1> What do you mean?
[02:40:13] <seutje> he means siblings :P
[02:40:23] <Anticom> "Is there a way to check that at value can only occur maximum four time"
[02:40:29] <Anticom> seutje yep :P
[02:40:43] <jac0bz1> 2 seconds, i'll show you
[02:40:51] <Anticom> jsfiddle ftw :)
[02:44:10] <jac0bz1> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/2VbdB/
[02:45:13] <Anticom> jac0bz1 can i pm you so we could chat in german?
[02:45:48] <jac0bz1> Shure.. but I dont speak german :(
[02:45:58] <Anticom> lul but your demo code is german o.O
[02:46:21] <jac0bz1> "gruppe" must mean the same in german and norwegian then :P
[02:46:34] <Anticom> haha lol okay
[02:46:42] <blackspotwiggins> norwegian is northern germanic, so..
[02:46:45] <blackspotwiggins> there are similarities
[02:47:39] <quicksilver> jac0bz1: you can use, for example
[02:47:40] <quicksilver> $('select[name="attendee[group][]"][value=0]')
[02:47:47] <quicksilver> to count the number with value 0
[02:47:55] <quicksilver> (and check if it's >= 4);
[02:47:58] <Anticom> no he want's to disable the options in the other select fields i think
[02:48:09] <quicksilver> yes, it's just a starting point to show him how to check.
[02:48:20] <quicksilver> So in the change event, check how many there are now with that same value
[02:48:26] <quicksilver> and if it's >= 4, disable all the others.
[02:50:31] <JensVH> hello all
[02:50:52] <wachpwnski> If I get an ajax response, how can I tell if that contains some dom object?
[02:51:34] <Cork> wachpwnski: data.length ?
[02:52:12] <wachpwnski> Cork, maybe look for an id like #errors
[02:53:35] <jacta> Does anyone knows a jquery script that can take json/array with "id" - and cycle thru them as fast as possible and stop when a button is clicked - for a competition
[02:54:01] <jacta> so it randomly shows an id on the screen in a div
[02:54:03] <wachpwnski> i got it
[02:54:10] <wachpwnski> response.find('.errors')
[02:55:04] <wachpwnski> nevermidn that didn't work
[02:56:00] <wachpwnski> I just want to check the dom for elements with a class of errors
[02:59:51] <jacta> Can anyone help me with an idea how to start
[03:05:15] <keirlav87> I have a script that returns a complete html document, i.e. from <html> to </html> as a value in a json object, is it possible to use this json value to populate the contents of an iframe?
[03:07:06] <se-lite_> karolyi: cant you just use that script as src for the iframe?
[03:07:59] <LordThumper> Not sure if iframe allows you to load html like that
[03:08:19] <AdamPDotty> jacta: for (var index=0; buttonNotClicked; index= ++index%myarray.length)
[03:08:19] <AdamPDotty> 	$(mydiv).html(myarray[i]);
[03:08:19] <AdamPDotty> $(mybutton).click(function(){buttonNotClicked = false;});
[03:08:20] <LordThumper> If you are generating the markup from script, why not load it into a div?
[03:09:08] <jacta> interresting, AdamPDotty
[03:09:15] <jacta> what format is the array
[03:09:30] <jacta> maybe we can jsfiddle something out
[03:09:38] <AdamPDotty> just numbered with the IDs as values
[03:09:54] <Anticom> seutje got an idea how to use ajax calls with qTip2? somehow i just don't get it to work :/
[03:10:19] <seutje> Anticom: not off the top of my head, I haven't used it since it was still jqtip
[03:10:46] <jacta> AdamPDotty, the concept is that a huge screen will cycle thru random ids from the string (visible in the field) and stop then its being told
[03:11:14] <Anticom> maybe you could take a look at my code anyway seutje http://jsfiddle.net/jEkJM/
[03:12:59] <se-lite_> Anticom: but access the server?
[03:13:00] <keirlav87> Anticom, I think you need to pass data into the success function of your ajax call
[03:13:07] <Christer_> Hi all, could you have a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/9WZUf/ - How can i get the previous <tr> when selecting a element inside a <td><ul> - // See example
[03:13:35] <adam_lynch> hey, is there a way to extend an already binded event?
[03:13:37] <Anticom> keirlav87 doc says there's a default success handler
[03:13:41] <se-lite_> Anticom: my guess would be your use of "this"
[03:13:42] <Anticom> se-lite_ ???
[03:14:03] <adam_lynch> Twitter's Bootstrap has an on.('click'.. event that I want to add some functionality too
[03:14:10] <adam_lynch> but I'd prefer not to edit it
[03:14:11] <Anticom> it should log 'NULL' if there was some issue with the scope of this se-lite_
[03:14:42] <jacta> AdamPDotty, would that not cause endless loop due speed?
[03:14:58] <adam_lynch> what I had done up til now was bind my own function to the click event and use setTimeout to wait until the Bootstrap code is probably done
[03:14:59] <Anticom> adam_lynch you could register a second click event? or do you want to use existing data in the callback and modify it?
[03:15:16] <adam_lynch> Anticom: I want the existing code to run
[03:15:20] <adam_lynch> then execute my own
[03:15:26] <adam_lynch> without editing the original
[03:15:34] <adam_lynch> so kind of like an append but for event
[03:15:39] <adam_lynch> maybe extend can help?
[03:15:47] <adam_lynch> I'm not great with extend
[03:16:01] <seutje> Anticom: are you sure the "this" you are using references what you assume it does?
[03:16:15] <AdamPDotty> jacta: "endless" until you click that button
[03:16:23] <AdamPDotty> sounded like thats what you wanted
[03:16:41] <jacta> AdamPDotty, it is - 2 sec - maybe you can look at my code
[03:16:43] <Anticom> seutje problem is, that NOTHING get's logged to console so i assume the annonymus function never gets called at all
[03:16:47] <Anticom> i've updated the example: http://jsfiddle.net/jEkJM/1/
[03:17:22] <jacta> AdamPDotty, seems like somwe delay maybe should be added also?
[03:18:05] <se-lite_> Anticom: can you use it ajax like that with qtip? Seem like content take url and data arguments, not ajax
[03:18:20] <se-lite_> (if i didn't skip through the docs too fast)
[03:18:22] <AdamPDotty> then have a look at setInterval()
[03:18:50] <se-lite_> *can you use qtip with ajax like that
[03:18:53] <Anticom> se-lite_ i don't even get what you mean o.O
[03:19:08] <adam_lynch> Anticom: any ideas?
[03:19:22] <Anticom> adam_lynch for?
[03:19:25] <se-lite_> Anticom: from the docs, qtip takes content: { url: <url>, data: data}
[03:19:28] <AdamPDotty> christer: $(this).closest('.shiprow-products).prev()
[03:19:35] <Anticom> se-lite_ yep i can, it's copied straight from the docs except the annonymus func
[03:19:45] <Anticom> se-lite_ https://github.com/Craga89/qTip2/blob/master/docs/plugins/ajax.md
[03:19:46] <Christer_> AdamPDotty - thanks :)
[03:19:53] <Anticom> se-lite_ read this
[03:20:12] <AdamPDotty> missing one '
[03:20:17] <se-lite_> Anticom: ah, sorry.. i checked the qtip plugin
[03:20:47] <Anticom> adam_lynch no i meant just $('whateverelement').click(function() { /*some fancy stuff going on here*/ });
[03:21:04] <se-lite_> Anticom: i can see if it works for me here
[03:22:07] <adam_lynch> Anticom: that helps //sarcasm
[03:27:14] <Anticom> lol why it works here?! http://jsfiddle.net/jEkJM/3/
[03:27:15] <Anticom> oO
[03:27:37] <Anticom> adam_lynch just as i said... add a second click event handler
[03:27:42] <Anticom> there you can do whatever you want
[03:28:30] <jacta> AdamPDotty, thanks - what do you think about this? http://jsfiddle.net/Jacta/Y87Ha/
[03:29:27] <comet_> more of a css question I suppose, but why is this shadow cut off? http://jsfiddle.net/7sYxZ/7/
[03:30:35] <AdamPDotty> jacta: looks ok for a start, though its mor "jumping" than "cycling" through
[03:31:39] <jacta> AdamPDotty, can be that I said something wrong - it needs to put random id all the time there - just in start wanted some more smoothness - dont think its possible though?
[03:33:19] <AdamPDotty> ähhm
[03:33:38] <AdamPDotty> you dont need "stop" there, look at clearInterval()!
[03:36:14] <Koganei> hm, $('.foo'). on('all', fn); doesn't seem to work :o
[03:36:46] <NodeX> all ? , is that even an event?
[03:36:57] <Koganei> that was my question
[03:37:08] <Koganei> works in backbone :/ too bad it doesn't work here
[03:37:23] <NodeX> use backbone then ;)
[03:37:46] <tapia> Hi
[03:38:23] <tapia> I'm working in a heavy-javascript-based project, and I'm guessing what's the best way to organize code
[03:38:37] <Koganei> NodeX: thanks :p
[03:38:37] <tapia> I'd like to do it like in any other project, each class in a file, and so
[03:39:03] <tapia> but I don't want to write a <script> tag for each one
[03:39:12] <tapia> what's the best approach to do that?
[03:39:27] <sunbeam> Hi, I need to be able with jquery datepicker to mark some dates
[03:39:31] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this besyt?
[03:39:36] <sunbeam> best
[03:54:14] <Anticom> :facepalm: -.-
[03:54:49] <christophler> Hi, Ive just debugged an error in my javaascript. Ive got a linked list, and Im calling "this.next.recurse(value)". Ive changed this is "this.next.recurse.apply(this.next, [value]); That looks completeliy dumb to me. But it works. Is scoping for class functions really that naive in javascript?
[03:54:50] <Anticom> hahaha i've copied the api script from another. all the others return json so i sent headers.... now qTip is totally right, when it complains, that it can't parse the returned json (which is html in reality)
[03:55:12] <Anticom> christophler user jsfiddle
[03:56:27] <christophler> Anticom: hmm... that will take a while
[03:57:41] <Anticom> yea but for me understanding what you mean by this ramped up code in message in irc all together will also take a while to understand
[03:57:44] <Anticom> and even longer to answer
[03:58:51] <christophler> okay
[03:58:56] <christophler> Ive got the basics in js fiddle
[03:59:04] <christophler> let me check its basically working
[04:00:39] <christophler> nah, ive not fixed the bug anyway
[04:00:41] <christophler> bbl
[04:02:12] <pangelovski> what is the proper jquery way of passing parameters from one page to another
[04:02:22] <pangelovski> is it url based?
[04:02:39] <nFFF> ?post
[04:02:49] <nFFF> .post
[04:02:50] <nFFF> -post
[04:03:10] <nFFF> pangelovski, look up ajax on juery docs
[04:03:22] <wachpwnski> jacta: how to start what?
[04:03:22] <pangelovski> will do
[04:06:17] <jacta> wachpwnski, just had to make this: http://jsfiddle.net/Jacta/Y87Ha/1/
[04:06:34] <nFFF> christophler, why does the second seem dumb?
[04:06:46] <nFFF> You probably have issues with 'this' in your object
[04:06:52] <nFFF> so you need to give it context
[04:07:06] <nFFF> oh wait your applying itself
[04:07:47] <wachpwnski> jacta:  what on earth is that? lol
[04:08:43] <faraway> wachpwnski: probably a hidden message ... if you start to do strange things you know the reason now :P
[04:11:37] <christophler> Anticom: the answer, not surprisingly, is no, function calls through prototypes are not that naive
[04:12:03] <christophler> nFFF: Ive got my head around moving context around, I just made an error in logic and then made up a stupid reasonf or it
[04:12:17] <christophler> well not logic, but implementation of a function factoring
[04:12:28] <Anticom> christophler the answer to what?!
[04:13:03] <jacta> wachpwnski, for a competition to find a winner :p
[04:13:40] <christophler> Hmm. OK, the realquestion is "If I use dot notation to call a function on an object, from an object of the same type, do I have to explicity use apply to make sure the function call is made in the context of the object used to reference the function"
[04:13:44] <christophler> the answer is no
[04:13:46] <christophler> obviously, really
[04:14:07] <christophler> just had a brain strain
[04:14:15] <christophler> just ate lunch I guess
[04:15:15] <Anticom> christophler the answer is 42 :P
[04:17:26] <wachpwnski> jacta: did I win?
[04:17:50] <jacta> wachpwnski, dunno :p its for a lottery for 10k danish money to travel :p
[04:18:10] <wachpwnski> ooh danke!
[04:18:58] <beasty> morning guys
[04:19:01] <beasty> got a question
[04:19:13] <beasty> how can i test if a object is a select or a input ?
[04:20:22] <faraway> beasty: http://api.jquery.com/is/
[04:23:11] <adam_lynch> quick Q: if I'm using $.each(..., function(index, element){...});
[04:23:21] <adam_lynch> which is faster?
[04:23:52] <adam_lynch> var el = listBeingIterated.eq(index);
[04:23:52] <adam_lynch> or
[04:23:58] <seutje> Anticom: sry, was eating, when I hover it I can see the ajax request 404ing
[04:24:01] <adam_lynch> var el = $(element);
[04:24:10] <Anticom> got it working now
[04:24:20] <Anticom> solution was each-loop so that i got reference for this
[04:24:57] <sunbeam> Hi, I need to be able with jquery datepicker to mark some dates
[04:24:59] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this besyt?
[04:25:00] <sunbeam> best
[04:25:14] <seutje> Anticom: oh ok, btw, I didn't know you could pass a function to the data prop
[04:25:41] <Anticom> seutje you always can ;)
[04:28:35] <seutje> learn something new every day
[04:29:23] <seutje> odd, docs don't mention this and explicitly mention object or string
[04:29:55] <Anticom> :D
[04:33:13] <faraway> seutje: well a function is a Function Object ;)
[04:33:17] <miCSu> ain't it possible to use a :selector inside another?
[04:33:30] <seutje> faraway: I suppose, but it'll just serialize it
[04:33:46] <seutje> I don't even know what a serialized function object will look like
[04:33:47] <miCSu> I'm having slideshow like div with list that rolls over pictures.. there's parameter idx to change to a specific img, but it ain't working with: $("div.slideshow ul li:not(div.slideshow ul li:nth-child("+idx+"))").removeClass('active') ?
[04:34:22] <seutje> miCSu: nth-child isn't 0-indexed, idx is?
[04:34:32] <miCSu> idx ain't either
[04:34:35] <miCSu> 1+
[04:35:24] <juria_roberts> I have given an enter key press even handler on document but want to give another even handler on a text box when enter key is pressed on keyup of the text box.Right now even when enter key is pressed in text box it takes it as document enter key press.how do I solve it?
[04:36:48] <Palanivel> Hi Hi...while file uploading, i am getting only that file name not full path...........what i want to do
[04:36:50] <miCSu> well.. it works with $("div.slideshow ul li").not("div.slideshow ul li:nth-child("+idx+")") so I'll just use that instead
[04:36:50] <Palanivel> ?
[04:37:04] <fALSO> Hi!!!
[04:37:27] <fALSO> $("input[name=material_id]").click(function() { <- how can i MAke this work if the input material_id is added to the page via ajax ?
[04:37:37] <fALSO> doesnt seem to work :(
[04:38:22] <fALSO> anyone has an idea'
[04:38:57] <Palanivel> anyone having idea about this
[04:39:15] <blackspotwiggins> Palanivel, still not liking google eh?
[04:39:24] <seutje> fALSO: use .on()
[04:39:28] <seutje> ?on @ fALSO
[04:39:28] <bot-t> fALSO, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:39:44] <ravenzz> uhm
[04:39:47] <fALSO> uhuhuh thanks
[04:39:52] <fALSO> going to look into examples
[04:40:02] <Palanivel> @blackspotwiggins...am tried that y am came here
[04:40:46] <ravenzz> is it somehow possible to inherit the onSelect event hadler on jquery ui datepicker?
[04:41:34] <juria_roberts> I have given an enter key press even handler on document but want to give another even handler on a text box when enter key is pressed on keyup of the text box.Right now even when enter key is pressed in text box it takes it as document enter key press.how do I solve it?
[04:41:44] <ravenzz> i mean $('.foo').datepicker({ onSelect: function () { console.log("foo") } }); and later do: $('.foo').datepicker({ onSelect: function () { console.log("bar") } });
[04:41:51] <diverdude> Hello, I am trying to place a glyph icon in a tab, using twitter-bootstrap. However, for some reason, the tab which implements the active class hides the icon places there. Is there any way to avoid this, and show the icon as well as the text in the active tab? I made a fiddle illustrating here: http://jsfiddle.net/EBnGX/3/
[04:42:08] <robertotauille> hey guys, I need a html editor in jquery
[04:42:16] <robertotauille> can you show me any ?
[04:42:24] <fALSO> seutje,  that inst working -> $("input[name=material_id]").on("click", function(event){
[04:42:34] <fALSO> seutje,  im looking int .live() now
[04:42:42] <seutje> live is deprecated
[04:42:46] <diverdude> robbyoconnor: how about CKEditor ?
[04:42:58] <diverdude> robertotauille: ^
[04:43:02] <fALSO> is that on in the correct format ?
[04:43:03] <diverdude> robertotauille: CKEditor
[04:43:54] <seutje> fALSO: well, the idea is that you call on() on a wrapper element and pass the specific selector as wecond argument
[04:43:56] <seutje> second*
[04:44:31] <robertotauille> diverdude: thank man.. but I do not like the theme...
[04:44:41] <diverdude> robertotauille: whats wrong with it?
[04:44:47] <seutje> generally $('#myform').on('click', 'input[name=material_id]', function(e) { /* ... */ });
[04:44:48] <jacta> Can I get height of span? Tried console.log($("#test").height()); without luck
[04:44:53] <jacta> with span id="test"
[04:45:03] <robertotauille> is ugly
[04:45:21] <seutje> fALSO: .on binds on the element you call it on and checks if the selector matches the actual element firing the event
[04:45:21] <diverdude> robertotauille: ehhh ok so build one yourself
[04:45:36] <seutje> but it checks it when the event gets fired, not when it gets bound
[04:46:18] <robertotauille> diverdude:
[04:46:18] <robertotauille> I'm thinking ... or make a theme pro ckeditor
[04:46:43] <diverdude> robertotauille: you mean just alternative icons?
[04:47:12] <jacta> getting this error: TypeError: $("#test") is null
[04:47:24] <jacta> http://jsfiddle.net/Jacta/RPFMh/
[04:48:12] <faraway> jacta: well you selecte mootools and not jquery as framework
[04:48:19] <jacta> omg :o
[04:48:27] <robertotauille> diverdude: yes.. but the form upload images too
[04:48:42] <jacta> faraway, thanks alot - ffs :p
[04:48:47] <jacta> wasted 20 minutes there :p
[04:48:57] <faraway> jacta ;)
[04:49:09] <diverdude> robertotauille: so get started creating icons
[04:50:56] <jacta> faraway, how to count number of span elements in a div
[04:51:38] <faraway> jacta: $(divSelector).find("span").length
[04:52:08] <faraway> jacta: descendant or child ?
[04:52:24] <diverdude> JackBauer24: $('#divid').find('span').length or something like that
[04:52:27] <jacta> just <div><span></span><span></span><span></span></div>
[04:52:36] <diverdude> jacta:  $('#divid').find('span').length or something like that
[04:52:42] <jacta> would give 3 :p
[04:52:55] <jacta> perfect :o - smaaart
[04:52:58] <wachpwnski> how do you turn all anchors that are a certain class into buttons?
[04:53:10] <computer2000> i want to execute $(iconsContainer).removeClass('bounceInDown').addClass('bounceOutLeft'); how can i add a delay between $(iconsContainer) and .removeClass(... how can i do that, since these functions are not in the fx queue which delay() uses?
[04:55:05] <jacta> faraway, what about finding first span height in that div
[04:55:18] <seutje> computer2000: good old timeout?
[04:55:21] <diverdude> .firrst()
[04:55:27] <diverdude> .first()
[04:55:41] <diverdude> .first().css('height')
[04:55:57] <computer2000> seutje: yea maybe. thought there may be a possibility from jquery
[04:56:33] <wachpwnski> How come this is not working: $( "a.action-button" ).button();
[04:57:15] <miCSu> wachpwnski: is there such method called button() ?
[04:57:29] <Arkns> hi all. morning here! question 01: the code on this link(http://papermashup.com/jquery-fading-a-div-after-a-certain-time/) will run once or every 15 second? And if I put this code (without jquery ready) on function and calling it every 'save action' will run just once or will be set to run every 15 seconds?
[04:57:34] <wachpwnski> for jquery ui yes.
[05:04:08] <entr> for the mozilla fans, latest thunderbird supports irc now.

[05:06:42] <agu10^> hey guys! I have a problem.
[05:07:22] <agu10^> my div is like this: <div id="mydiv"> text <div id="childDiv" /> text </div>
[05:07:40] <agu10^> I need to delet the text while leaving my childDiv inside... any clues?
[05:07:54] <seutje> enoch: use a virtualbox or something :P
[05:07:58] <slartsa> dude, <div id="childDiv" /> ??
[05:08:08] <agu10^> yea
[05:08:18] <slartsa> ok, just asking
[05:08:27] <slartsa> just keep that /
[05:08:45] <agu10^> it's just an example
[05:08:58] <slartsa> but do you have a closing / in your code?
[05:09:02] <slartsa> in your div i mean
[05:09:31] <agu10^> yes. the code i wrote is ok
[05:09:54] <agu10^> <div id="mydiv"> text <div id="childDiv">HELLO</div> text </div>
[05:09:55] <slartsa> dude, you're not supposed to use / in div?
[05:09:58] <slartsa> oh ok
[05:09:59] <agu10^> ^ or like that if you want
[05:10:26] <LordThumper> What is wrong with this? $("body").append("<img/>". { src: "foo.gif" title: "test" })
[05:10:27] <agu10^> I need to leave that childDiv intact while deleting text
[05:10:43] <LordThumper> Only getting <img> created (without attributes)

[05:12:20] <LordThumper> var foo = $("#mydiv").children();
[05:12:32] <LordThumper> $("#mydiv").contents(foo);
[05:12:42] <agu10^> nice
[05:12:45] <LordThumper> Should clear the text
[05:14:25] <seutje> agu10^: http://jsfiddle.net/LTKc7/1/
[05:14:31] <agu10^> LordThumper, it does not work
[05:15:06] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/N3LPB/
[05:15:31] <seutje> eh, why the empty html call?
[05:15:36] <olly_c> nslookup earthserver.pml.ac.uk
[05:15:48] <seutje> LordThumper: http://jsfiddle.net/N3LPB/1/ is fine no?
[05:16:04] <seutje> html() already replaces
[05:16:07] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/N3LPB/2/
[05:16:09] <LordThumper> Ye
[05:16:30] <seutje> also, no need to include body and html elements in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/N3LPB/3/
[05:16:52] <LordThumper> seutje, any idea why this doesn't work?
[05:16:55] <LordThumper> $("body").append("<img/>", { src: "foo.gif" title: "test" })
[05:16:56] <agu10^> and how do I select only the FIRST child ?
[05:17:04] <agu10^> $(this).children(0) ?
[05:17:07] <djshotglass> https://gist.github.com/d08a2329a183006c6ff5 the setTimeout inside the chat_update() never fires
[05:17:10] <LordThumper> $("div:first")
[05:17:16] <LordThumper> or $(this).get(0)
[05:17:26] <seutje> and repeating selectors are bad:  http://jsfiddle.net/N3LPB/4/
[05:17:29] <wachpwnski> what is this in jquery: $("string", "string")
[05:17:41] <seutje> LordThumper: missing a comma
[05:18:25] <LordThumper> Another mistype
[05:18:40] <LordThumper> Got no syntax error in my live

[05:22:34] <agu10^> guys
[05:22:46] <agu10^> is there any way to delete other divs other than that?
[05:22:55] <agu10^> because I'm breaking some 3rd party code by doing that
[05:23:22] <LifeSF> been really busy and i have very little time today but i noticed someone talking to me i don't know when and so if there's anything, now's the time
[05:23:24] <agu10^> I guess $(this).html($(this).children().get(0)); is NOT the same as deleting the rest
[05:23:31] <LifeSF> oops wrong window
[05:23:42] <agu10^> it is first deleting everything, then adding the div again. right?
[05:24:07] <agu10^> that must be causing an issue
[05:24:24] <agu10^> because when I manually delete it in chrome, it works fine.
[05:24:48] <seutje> agu10^: it's setting the innerHtml to that div
[05:24:57] <agu10^> yes, that's not waht I want.
[05:25:00] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/uQ5sg/
[05:25:03] <agu10^> I want to delete everything but that DIV
[05:25:10] <LordThumper> Can someone take a look at that?
[05:25:13] <agu10^> NOT change the innerHTML and re-parse it
[05:27:32] <agu10^> seutje, is there any way to access the innerHTML WITHOUT touching the innner objects?
[05:27:37] <agu10^> like, deleting just the text?
[05:27:56] <nFFF> are selectors via class quicker then say name or any other attribute?
[05:27:57] <juha_> agu10^: $(selector).text("");
[05:27:58] <agu10^> I DO NOT want to delete everything and then add the objects again.
[05:28:12] <agu10^> juha_, that deletes everything inside. even inner elements
[05:28:19] <juha_> agu10^: for that case you need to specify your selector
[05:28:23] <LordThumper> agu10^
[05:28:24] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/N3LPB/5/
[05:28:27] <LordThumper> That removes all text nodes
[05:28:35] <LordThumper> Without touching anything else
[05:30:10] <LordThumper> If you want to remove anything except the div change the logic to if $(this).is(":not(.innerDiv)")
[05:30:14] <LordThumper> Or whatever you want
[05:30:42] <agu10^> LordThumper, how can I keep only the FIRST div?
[05:30:49] <agu10^> hm
[05:32:16] <agu10^> I got it!
[05:32:21] <agu10^> thanks LordThumper, it works now

[05:33:07] <agu10^> that's what im using
[05:33:17] <djshotglass> it works if i move it out of the $.getJSON but then the requests can pile up
[05:33:54] <LordThumper> Anyone http://jsfiddle.net/uQ5sg/ ?
[05:34:07] <LordThumper> I'm not sure if I'm writing it wrong
[05:34:14] <LordThumper> agu10^: np
[05:35:15] <LordThumper> Probably .append doesn't support passing a second object
[05:36:28] <Qzen> LordThumper, what are you trying to accomplish?
[05:37:30] <LordThumper> Creating a new node in an .append()
[05:37:39] <nFFF> are selectors via class quicker then say name or any other attribute?
[05:37:54] <LordThumper> $("<div/>", {id: "foo" }) works
[05:38:11] <LordThumper> but not .append("<div/>", {id: "foo" })
[05:38:21] <Qzen> LordThumper, then i can't help you :(
[05:38:32] <LordThumper> Have to do .append($("<div/>", {id: "foo" }))
[05:38:41] <fALSO> seutje,  so how can i had a on click to a input element that is loaded by ajax ?
[05:38:54] <fALSO> $("input[name=material_id]").on("click", function(event){
[05:38:59] <fALSO> this simply doesnt do anything
[05:39:12] <LordThumper> fALSO $("document").on("click", "input[name=material_id]", function () { })
[05:39:19] <LordThumper> Replace document with the nearest stable element
[05:39:30] <smatt> If I make an array of all inputs with class in, how do I then pick them out individually? unsure of the syntax on this
[05:39:38] <LordThumper> smatt
[05:39:38] <fALSO> can it be the <form> tag lordthumper ?
[05:39:41] <Qzen> Anyone skilled enough to help me debug my website real quick. I have a weird problem with my jQuery setup.
[05:39:47] <fALSO> the page alawys has the form
[05:39:51] <LordThumper> $.each(array, function(key,value) { })
[05:40:15] <LordThumper> fALSO: Stable I mean the closest ancestor that is not changed by Ajax
[05:40:19] <LordThumper> Yes form is fine
[05:41:10] <smatt> LordThumper: Thanks. Still a little unclear. I'm cycling through all the input fields but need to track which one I'm on with a counter, as it won't do them all in one go.
[05:41:15] <fALSO> ok nice!!! thank you
[05:41:33] <LordThumper> smatt: Yeah one by one
[05:41:45] <smatt> Some thing along var $ins = $('.input-class');  then ins[count].val() … ?
[05:41:47] <LordThumper> smatt: $("input").each(function () { $(this) })
[05:42:02] <LordThumper> $(this) is your current input
[05:42:25] <smatt> I'm not looping through the inputs, sorry I didn't explain very well
[05:42:42] <LordThumper> oh I see, yeah you can do that
[05:43:04] <LordThumper> You can select individual items as you would access array items
[05:43:09] <smatt> hmm ok
[05:43:12] <LordThumper> $elements[0]
[05:43:14] <LordThumper> $elements[5]
[05:43:28] <smatt> Would you mind taking a ooh at http://jsfiddle.net/ukSPX/12/ please. Am a little stuck :o
[05:43:41] <LordThumper> sure
[05:43:56] <fALSO> lordthumper,  thanks that worked!
[05:44:15] <smatt> Know I need to change the val() reference to the checkbox as that's not the number I want, it's the value attribute
[05:47:39] <entr>  is it ok to use <time> already?

[05:53:06] <fALSO> just another question
[05:53:22] <fALSO> is there any problem of having: $(document).ready(function() {
[05:53:26] <fALSO> on multiple js files ?
[05:53:41] <LordThumper> no
[05:53:52] <LordThumper> $(function () {})
[05:53:54] <LordThumper> Is the same
[05:53:58] <LordThumper> But shorter
[05:54:12] <LordThumper> you can have as many as you want
[05:54:25] <fALSO> thanks lordthumper

[05:57:14] <agu10^> guys
[05:57:27] <agu10^> I need to emulate the user clicking on a dropdown menu
[05:57:38] <agu10^> not just change its value but firing its events
[05:57:39] <agu10^> any idea?
[05:58:09] <LordThumper> $("dropdown").trigger("click")
[05:58:29] <Nitrxgen> another odd request, is there a channel or something where I can ask about hardware? I have 2 items on amazon I'm thinking of buying but I don't know which one is best
[05:58:53] <agu10^> LordThumper, click a specific option in the select
[05:58:58] <agu10^> not just click the dropdown
[05:59:16] <LordThumper> Which one?
[05:59:22] <Nitrxgen> my normal channel, a friend is spilling his heart out about his life and I don't want to interrupt by asking about what thing to buy
[05:59:26] <agu10^> isn't there a way to completely emulate selecting the second option?
[05:59:27] <LordThumper> By id, by index?
[05:59:43] <agu10^> index = 1
[05:59:54] <LordThumper> Let me make you an example on jsfiddle
[05:59:55] <agu10^> by index
[05:59:58] <agu10^> ok
[06:00:14] <agu10^> I'm hacking google's translate widget
[06:00:19] <agu10^> to make it automatic
[06:01:29] <smatt> LordThumper: that works perfectly thank you! Now to try to understand how it works…! :o
[06:02:19] <smatt> ah except the 6-9 boxes don't work - the actual use case is ~30 boxes and 12 inputs, any combination of 1-12 ticks should go into the inputs
[06:02:35] <LordThumper> smatt: Can make you a cleaner example, but I have to go soon
[06:02:40] <smatt> but they might use boxes 18-30 if that makes sense
[06:02:48] <smatt> LordThumper: no problem, thanks for the help, appreciate it.

[06:14:19] <code_ph0y> ?
[06:15:41] <LordThumper> jQuery object?
[06:15:51] <LordThumper> $(element).val("example")
[06:16:19] <code_ph0y> nice LordThumper thought so :D
[06:17:00] <code_ph0y> LordThumper: is this correct? ... if($(this).attr('checked')==true) {
[06:17:01] <hashpuppy> $("#clear-range").on("click", function(e) { console.log("here"); });  <-- why am I not seeing "click" once the clear-range element is destroyed and then recreated
[06:17:25] <LordThumper> code_ph0y: $(this).is("checked")
[06:17:30] <LordThumper>  $(this).is(":checked")
[06:17:35] <LordThumper> Last one
[06:17:38] <code_ph0y> .click(function() {......});
[06:17:57] <code_ph0y> thanks bud much love!
[06:18:06] <seutje> hashpuppy: the thing you call .on() on is the context, that's where the event is bound, the selector you pass is the dynamic one
[06:18:12] <obert-> is this correct to add opacity when the input is focused? http://pastebin.com/T6dvP3DR
[06:18:35] <LordThumper> hashpoppy: $("body").on("click", "#clear-range", function (e) { })
[06:18:39] <seutje> so I guess it should be $(document).on('click', '#clear-range', function(e) { console.log(e.type); });
[06:18:46] <seutje> or yea, body
[06:19:18] <hashpuppy> ahh.  thanks, guys

[06:27:59] <Nomikos> LordThumper: yeah, but I want to be able to set items /afterwards/

[06:32:29] <pyxorg> Hi, I have troubles with jquery 1.8. When I do $('foo') I get the element which id is "foo", and when I do $('#bar') or $('.bar') I get null even if I have "bar" id or classes.
[06:33:15] <ajpiano> sounds like you have another library on your page that's taking over the $ function
[06:33:15] <pyxorg> I checked out on the releases note if something changed at this level but it doesn't seems to.
[06:33:29] <ajpiano> i assure you we didn't break $("#foo") in 1.8
[06:36:10] <pyxorg> I just have jquery.js (which is a symlink to jquery-1.8.min.js), an empty js file and a file containing an single line console.log('test')
[06:36:21] <snover> ajpiano you broke $("#foo") in 1.8? :(((((((
[06:37:06] <ajpiano> pyxorg: why don't you make a test case on jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com illustrating the same thing
[06:37:32] <pyxorg> ok, I check this out
[06:37:42] <LordThumper> ajpiano: Is the jQuery module selector still in progress?
[06:37:53] <LordThumper> So we can select which modules we need?
[06:38:10] <ajpiano> i don't believe at the present time we are planning a front-end for that
[06:38:15] <ajpiano> you can do custom builds from the command line
[06:38:31] <LordThumper> Oh will check it out, thanks
[06:38:40] <ajpiano> though we may look at a front-end down the line
[06:38:41] <ajpiano> not sure
[06:41:32] <Nomikos> simpler example: http://jsfiddle.net/Knhnd/2/
[06:42:00] <Nomikos> it seems like just the 'items' option can't be set afterwards?
[06:43:39] <obert-> if i add an alert, at line 5 i'll get it in a loop
[06:44:30] <pyxorg> hmm, I imported my scripts with href instead of src --"
[06:45:30] <pyxorg> 99% times the error is stupid mistake xD
[06:45:45] <Nomikos> maybe you can point out mine?
[06:46:40] <obert-> and mine
[06:47:49] <Nomikos> Is there anything else I should check before saying "I-think-I-found-a-bug" ?
[06:48:26] <seutje> Nomikos: do the docs mention it, is it already filed, ...
[06:48:38] <Nomikos> no, and will check
[06:48:50] <anli_> If I inspect my webpage in chrome or ff and I can see that a input type="checkbox" has checked="checked", and I can see that the checkbox is not checked, what can it be?
[06:48:56] <seutje> Nomikos: http://docs.jquery.com/How_to_Report_Bugs
[06:49:27] <anli_> both underscore and capitalized words...
[06:50:03] <Nomikos> hrm http://bugs.jquery.com/search?ticket=on

[06:59:52] <prodigel> hi all. I"m having an issue with scrollTop in chrome. Using jquery tabs switching combined with hash links and scrollTop to prevent default has scrolling mashes the tabs content - looks like a render issue, if I scroll manually up/down the page gets fixed. Anyone experienced something similar? Are there safer alternatives to scrollTop?
[07:00:54] <prodigel> also, in firefox I'm not experiencing this issue, IE haven't tested
[07:01:35] <jonkristian> nvmnd, figured it out:)
[07:04:27] <anli_> What does it take for a web browser to not show a checkbox as checked if I can read while inspecting the dom that its a <input type="checkbox" checked="checked">?
[07:05:34] <pachet> anli_ : you have to set the property on that dom element reference to falsy
[07:05:58] <pachet> anli_: examining the markup will still show that attribute as 'checked'

[07:07:52] <tash> how can you hide the html of a <td> ?
[07:07:58] <djdolber> also im a complete noob :)
[07:08:27] <djdolber> im more of a game developer so web is kinda a whole other world for me
[07:08:28] <timing_> sunbeam: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[07:08:45] <timing_> sunbeam: you are creating the dateobject wrong
[07:08:47] <wachpwnski> whats the diff between var and $?
[07:09:01] <timing_> new Date(2012,08,10-1) is correct
[07:09:06] <pachet> ?eval new Date('2012/08/10')
[07:09:11] <bot-t> pachet: <2012-08-09T18:30:00.000Z>
[07:09:31] <Brodingo> wach var is used to declare variables, $ is jquery
[07:09:31] <timing> ?eval new Date('2012.08.10')
[07:09:32] <bot-t> timing: <Invalid Date>
[07:09:35] <timing> a yes
[07:09:40] <sunbeam> ok
[07:09:42] <sunbeam> wachpwnski: timing
[07:09:43] <sunbeam> thanks
[07:09:45] <sunbeam> lets check
[07:09:51] <tash> I can use .hide() but that hides the <td>. I want to hide only the html in the <td>
[07:09:57] <sunbeam> anyway I want to mark a date with jquery date picker
[07:10:01] <sunbeam> but its really hard
[07:10:10] <tash> but, td.html().hide() doesn't work.
[07:10:14] <tash> so, not sure how to do that.
[07:10:24] <pachet> tash : $('td').children().hide()
[07:10:34] <pachet> i expect your followup to say 'but i dont have nodes in there just text'
[07:10:37] <pachet> to which i'd reply
[07:10:39] <pachet> use nodes
[07:11:24] <tash> pachet: you are correct, I only have text in there
[07:11:47] <pachet> wachpwnski: var is a native javascript keyword, $ is a defined function-object
[07:11:58] <pachet> oh sorry, Brodingo already gotcha
[07:12:26] <granden_> hmm
[07:12:31] <Brodingo> i forgot to tab his name whoops
[07:12:35] <granden_> It does not animate the background color.
[07:12:57] <granden_> $('#imgdiv').animate({ backgroundColor: "#25a647" }, 500); - Did like that
[07:13:04] <ajpiano> Brodingo: granden_ you need the color plugin to do color animations
[07:13:09] <granden_> Oh
[07:13:18] <Brodingo> ajpiano for UI?
[07:13:20] <granden_> ajpiano: Where do I find it?
[07:13:39] <ajpiano> oh
[07:13:53] <ajpiano> oh i misread, didn't realise ui was inplay
[07:13:54] <Brodingo> yeah ur ignorant
[07:14:09] <ajpiano> granden_: you need ui.effects
[07:14:15] <granden_> ah ok.
[07:14:47] <granden_> Al effects or only one or some?
[07:14:53] <granden_> only core effects?
[07:15:07] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.effect.js
[07:15:19] <ajpiano> i have no idea what "AI effects" is
[07:15:28] <pachet> you know, you start typing
[07:15:31] <pachet> it finishes your sentences
[07:15:40] <ajpiano> but if you want to do color animations and you have jquery ui, you need ui.core and ui.effect
[07:15:53] <granden_> ok
[07:16:01] <granden_> Thanks
[07:16:23] <ravenzz> given an element is possible to retrieve its datepicker object?
[07:16:57] <Nomikos> Bug filed.. seeing 'new' bugs that are 4 years old doesn't give me much hope :/
[07:17:23] <ajpiano> ravenzz: $("#elem").data("datepicker")
[07:17:41] <ajpiano> Nomikos: both core and ui stay relatively on top of new bugs
[07:17:43] <ajpiano> as they come on
[07:18:21] <ravenzz> oh nice I was going with $.datapicker._curInst
[07:18:40] <ajpiano> so i'm not sure what yuo're tlaking about. i don't discount the possibilty that there could be a bug that's status is "new" and is 4 years old
[07:19:47] <ScottG> Ok so IE is messing with my head. If I debug and step through an assignment of optionElement.text then IE updates the DOM objects text and outerHTML correctly. However, if I pess "continue" in my debugger instead of step it just updates .text but DOESN'T update the .outerHTML. What the hell is going on?
[07:19:48] <pachet> bugs page looks like its playing host to some hot python-on-sql action
[07:19:51] <pachet> and by action i mean errors
[07:20:05] <ravenzz> ajpiano thank you mate ;)
[07:20:06] <Nomikos> pachet: yeah, noticed that too, refresh fixes it usually
[07:20:08] <ajpiano> pachet: it happens

[07:21:26] <ajpiano> what is the use case for setitng the outerHTML of an <option>
[07:21:36] <xec_> pangelovski: try to use a live paste service like jsfiddle.net instead, and explain what you expect to happen, and what happens instead
[07:22:25] <ScottG> ajpiano: Well my issue is that if I let the page load normally there is no text in my option elements.
[07:22:41] <ScottG> ajpiano: It sets the value attribute fine but the text is empty for all of them.
[07:22:57] <ajpiano> well your users aren't going to be stepping through it with a debugger to solve the problem, so you probably want to attack that root problem
[07:23:02] <ajpiano> not timing issues with IE's debugger :p
[07:23:05] <ScottG> And this seems to be a result of the outerHTML not being updated correctly because I guess
[07:23:20] <pangelovski> i have two pages and when clicking a button on the first page, i want to be taken to the second page. however the alert in the script section is never executed
[07:23:21] <ScottG> ajpiano: No, you arne't understanding, if I step it works correctly, if I don't step then it doens't.
[07:23:28] <ajpiano> i realise that
[07:23:34] <ajpiano> but stepping with a debugger is not the solution to the problem
[07:23:48] <Nomikos> ajpiano: this page, http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/10?P=sortable
[07:24:12] <ajpiano> Nomikos: no doubt that tehre is a lot of cruft piled up on interactions
[07:24:12] <ScottG> ajpiano: I know. I am debugging because I can't figure out why it isn't adding the text to the DOM correctly but if I'm getting completely different results if I debug or not then I'm pretty fucking lost.
[07:24:28] <ajpiano> draggable, droppable, etc
[07:24:32] <ajpiano> they are all being refactored completely
[07:24:36] <Nomikos> ajpiano: but I hear UI is getting an overhaul so I'll work around it for now and wait
[07:24:40] <Nomikos> yeah
[07:24:43] <ajpiano> so there's a LOT of bugs that have been left to sit while other aspects of UI are being worked on
[07:25:04] <xec_> pangelovski: where is the link to the second page?
[07:25:06] <ajpiano> ScottG: can you make a demo of what you're experiencing, that will help a lot more than telling stories about the problem
[07:25:20] <ScottG> ajpiano: Yes I know, it's kinda complicated
[07:25:29] <pangelovski> xec_: in the buttons
[07:25:32] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: take a look at the "data" parameter you can supply when binding http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:25:44] <ScottG> ajpiano: I think I'm going to make a recording because I wanted to show my coworker
[07:25:50] <ajpiano> GoGoGarrett: what you have now actually *executes* the this.blah("foo"), and returns the result of that as the "handler"
[07:25:58] <ajpiano> recordings are the worst
[07:26:03] <ajpiano> strangers can't debug recording
[07:26:07] <xec_> pangelovski: sorry i don't see any buttons - what line # in that paste of yours?
[07:26:13] <ScottG> ajpiano: What would you suggest?
[07:26:20] <ScottG> Actually I"m going to draw a pciture
[07:26:22] <ajpiano> a live demo of the problem on jsfiddle or jsbin or your live site
[07:26:35] <p3rtutt1> if I use always the latest version of JQ my functions will work?
[07:26:49] <ajpiano> ScottG: when you need help from strangers on the internet, code helps a lot more than media
[07:27:16] <pangelovski> xec_: buttons are created on line 23
[07:27:34] <ScottG> ajpiano: The code isn't the problem. What's hard to explain is how I'm stepping
[07:27:38] <pachet> p3rtutt1: is that a followup question? if not, what the hell
[07:27:47] <ajpiano> the stepping is a red herring
[07:28:01] <p3rtutt1> pachet: what do you mean
[07:28:01] <p3rtutt1> ?
[07:28:17] <pachet> p3rtutt1: if i always use the latest tax form, will i never get audited?
[07:28:37] <p3rtutt1> pachet: I've no idea
[07:28:41] <ScottG> ajpiano: Well maybe this will help: http://privatepaste.com/c9dd824aaf
[07:28:51] <ajpiano> p3rtutt1: your question doesn't really make sense. the latest version of jquery doesn't magically innoculate you against syntax errors, logical errors, etc.
[07:29:07] <p3rtutt1> that's not what I meant to ask
[07:29:16] <ajpiano> ScottG: why not use jQuery to create thee elements
[07:29:23] <p3rtutt1> imagine, I've got a function that works with JQ 1.7
[07:29:31] <p3rtutt1> if I use 1.8, will it work?
[07:29:36] <ajpiano> ScottG: if you're creating these options in a loop, the best thing to do is build a large HTML string and inject it in a single append
[07:29:39] <seutje> I like that UI's autocomplete is becoming accessible
[07:29:46] <ajpiano> p3rtutt1: ostensibly, yes
[07:29:47] <seutje> now we can actually use it!
[07:30:03] <ScottG> ajpiano: How do I create elemtns with jq?
[07:30:20] <p3rtutt1> thanks ajpiano
[07:30:22] <jeffsmykil_> Best templating language to use with jquery?
[07:30:27] <ajpiano> $("<option value='foo'>bar</option>")
[07:30:32] <ScottG> I find that when creating elements the regular dom....yeah
[07:30:35] <ScottG> That's ugly as hell.
[07:30:37] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil_: doesn't matter really, as long as it spits out html
[07:30:39] <xec_> pangelovski: do you get the alert if you visit the page directly?
[07:30:45] <pangelovski> yes
[07:30:47] <pachet> p3rtutt1: just read the changelogs, there are certain oft-misused methods that were removed
[07:30:48] <ScottG> Using the regular dom looks much cleaner.
[07:30:51] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano so mustache and i can haz is fine?
[07:30:53] <ajpiano> ScottG: the best is to use a template engine
[07:31:06] <ScottG> Isn't that only for static content?
[07:31:06] <p3rtutt1> thanks pachet
[07:31:06] <pachet> granted, you probably have never used them, so i doubt you're in danger of having your code broken
[07:31:08] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil_: i prefer handlebars
[07:31:20] <pangelovski> xec_:
[07:31:22] <pangelovski> xec_: yes
[07:31:24] <ajpiano> ScottG: are you familiar with javscript templating engines such as underscore.js templating, mustache, handlebars, etc
[07:31:39] <ScottG> ajpiano: Anyways, best practices asside, there isn't anything inherently wrong with that code I set you is there?
[07:31:40] <ajpiano> they are decidedly *not* "only for static content"
[07:31:51] <ScottG> ajpiano: No I haven't but I will look into it. I'd like to solve this problem first.
[07:31:51] <seutje> I'm forced to prefer twig
[07:32:07] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano just handlebars or all of ember?
[07:32:20] <xec_> pangelovski: ok, so there's something jquery mobile is doing that interferes then. i don't have experience with that myself unfortunately. you could try #jquerymobile if noone else replies
[07:32:25] <ajpiano> ScottG: can we solve the problem with the tools availalbe instead of within the framework of subjective beauty you have proposed
[07:32:39] <ajpiano> ScottG: there isn't enough context around this code to explain the behaviour you're experiencing
[07:33:02] <ajpiano> like i said, a working (or not-working, as it were) demo helps a lot more
[07:33:05] <ScottG> ajpiano: That's the thing, the problem is contained within that code
[07:33:21] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil_: just handlebars
[07:33:22] <ScottG> ajpiano: Just based on where I stop the debugger in that code I get different results.
[07:33:43] <ScottG> ajpiano: Not just different results inside debugger variables, but in what is actually displayed on the page.
[07:33:50] <ajpiano> ScottG: where are you actually putting this element into the DOM
[07:34:04] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano: handlebars and mustache look very similar
[07:34:15] <ajpiano> they are similar but handlebars is a lot more robust
[07:34:20] <ScottG> ajpiano: I'm just doing a jq .append().
[07:34:21] <tocka> hey guys just wanted to ask
[07:34:22] <tocka> jQuery('.quantity, .productcol, .textcol, .product_grid_item, .wpsc-add-to-cart-button').each(function(){
[07:34:25] <tocka> what does this line do ?
[07:34:28] <tocka> I'm kind of confused
[07:34:37] <ajpiano> ScottG: i don't think option elements actually have a .text property
[07:34:42] <pachet> tocka: it builds a jquery object of elements with those class names
[07:34:44] <ScottG> ajpiano: They do.
[07:34:48] <tocka> thank you
[07:34:49] <pachet> then it loops over them using the .each method
[07:34:49] <tocka> :)
[07:35:06] <ScottG> ajpiano: And like I said, if I stop the debugger on certain lines it works perfeectly
[07:35:33] <xec_> pangelovski: two things you can do to see if my theory holds water; make a normal link without the transition and data-role="button" and see if that link works
[07:35:45] <ajpiano> ScottG: how would you like to proceed here
[07:36:01] <ajpiano> do you want to just keep talking about weird behaviour that i don't see and asking me to explain it
[07:36:03] <xec_> pangelovski: or just don't include jquery mobile to see if it still misbehaves
[07:36:08] <ajpiano> or do you want to put together a demo i can work with
[07:36:14] <ajpiano> or should i put together a demo that disproves that it doesn't work
[07:36:19] <ScottG> ajpiano: I don't understand what you mean by demo.
[07:36:23] <ajpiano> or proves how it could work if you usd a slightly differnet method
[07:36:33] <ajpiano> ?demo
[07:36:34] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:36:37] <sunbeam> anyway I want to mark a date with jquery date picker
[07:36:41] <sunbeam> does anyone know how to do this?
[07:37:28] <ScottG> ajpiano: Well for starters I think you should acknowledge that this is extremely erratic behavior and it's not my fault that it is behaving like this in the slightest.
[07:37:58] <entr> sunbeam: doesn't setDate work for you ?
[07:37:59] <entr> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#method-setDate
[07:38:12] <sethetter> I'm using the jQuery Touch Punch plugin alongside jQuery UI to enable draggable (on x-axis) on a horizontal list of nav links. However on iPhone the links are no longer clickable. Works fine on Android. Has anyone run into this issue?
[07:38:20] <ajpiano> ScottG: it's not anyone's "fault'
[07:38:29] <ScottG> ajpiano: It's IEs fault.
[07:38:30] <ajpiano> but you aren't giving us enough to work with to help solve the problem
[07:38:57] <ScottG> I don't think there is a solution to the problem. When I originally asked my question I just wanted to know if there was a know bug.
[07:39:17] <sunbeam> entr: i need to mark multiple dates
[07:39:36] <ajpiano> there is certainly a solution to the problem
[07:39:37] <entr> sunbeam: use multiple datepickers then
[07:39:40] <pachet> option elements, and input elements in general, are notoriously finicky in their implementations between the major browsers. IE's engine in particular doesn't really like you looking under the skirts of form elements
[07:39:40] <ScottG> Well there is ANOTHER solution because what I've done is technically a correct.
[07:39:43] <ajpiano> people create options dynamically in IE all the time
[07:40:14] <ScottG> It's acting like a subatomic particle or something. It behaves one way if I observe it and another way if I don't lol.
[07:40:32] <sunbeam> entr: no that's not what i need
[07:40:40] <sunbeam>  i need to give a class to a certain amount of dates
[07:41:14] <sunbeam> ajpiano: you maybe know this?
[07:41:28] <ajpiano> the ui datepicker doesn't support date ranges
[07:42:33] <sunbeam> damn
[07:42:38] <sunbeam> hm ok
[07:42:59] <sunbeam> no other solution to this? apart from using another one?
[07:43:03] <ScottG> ajpiano: I didn't expect this to work but take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/kSwVT/
[07:43:23] <ScottG> ajpiano: I don't know if you have access to IE8 but that doens't work in IE8.
[07:43:44] <jeffsmykil_> scottG ive never seen it done like that
[07:44:01] <ScottG> jeffsmykil_: Setting the text of a DOM element?
[07:44:03] <NoiseEee> ScottG: why wouldnt you be using jquery's methods to do that?!
[07:44:16] <jeffsmykil_> just append the option into the select
[07:44:20] <NoiseEee> thats the whole bloody point of libs like jquery
[07:44:30] <ScottG> NoiseEee: Primarily because I'm creating a new DOM element and jquery isn't good at creating DOM elements.
[07:44:38] <NoiseEee> ScottG: uh, its excellent at it.
[07:44:48] <jeffsmykil_> I do it allll the ime
[07:44:50] <jeffsmykil_> time
[07:44:54] <ScottG>  $("<option value='foo'>bar</option>")
[07:44:57] <Brodingo> i do it in my sleep
[07:45:05] <NoiseEee> var option = $('<option value="11">hey man</option>').appendTo(container)
[07:45:07] <Brodingo> i do it on accident sometimes
[07:45:09] <ScottG> That's what you call exelent?
[07:45:12] <pachet> i only create elements in jquery when i'm alone, or with someone
[07:45:14] <jeffsmykil_> tgats bit giw tiy di ut
[07:45:19] <jeffsmykil_> thats not how you do it
[07:45:22] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: do you maybe know how its possible to give multiple dates a class in jquery datepicker?
[07:45:25] <sunbeam> or ajpiano
[07:45:34] <ScottG> jeffsmykil_: That was ajpiano's example.
[07:45:41] <ScottG> jeffsmykil_: If you have a better way I'd love to see it.
[07:45:52] <NoiseEee> ScottG: sorry what's the complaint with that method exactly?
[07:45:53] <jeffsmykil_> I dont think ajpiano suggested that exctly
[07:46:00] <jeffsmykil_> because that exactly wouldnt do anything alone
[07:46:01] <ajpiano> i suggested exactly that
[07:46:06] <jeffsmykil_> and ajpiano is a genius
[07:46:09] <ajpiano> ScottG has reserved aesthetic complaints about it
[07:46:40] <ajpiano> despite the fact that it Works in IE8 http://jsfiddle.net/kSwVT/1/
[07:46:41] <NoiseEee> apply a flowery background to desktop, solved
[07:46:50] <jeffsmykil_> did you suggest templating??
[07:46:55] <ajpiano> i also suggested that
[07:46:59] <ak> is there any easy way to detect, if the mouse is leaving some object, but not when the mouse is leaving to the child of the object?
[07:47:00] <ScottG> Also, when creating a DOM element then giving it properties doing it with the DOM directly works smoothly. As you can see I just need to access the DOMs .text and .value members. This works very well.
[07:47:16] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano he posted one line of your code, not what you said exactly
[07:47:35] <jeffsmykil_> I have never used a selects text element
[07:47:37] <jeffsmykil_> thats a new one to me
[07:47:44] <NoiseEee> ScottG: in a truly helpful comment, and i'm really not disparaging... you're misguided
[07:47:51] <NoiseEee> ScottG: proceed as you wish
[07:47:55] <ajpiano> ScottG: ie8 prefers you to set innerText rather than text
[07:48:09] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/kSwVT/2/
[07:48:13] <ScottG> ajpiano: I'm not going to deny that it works. I'm mostly pissed that the way I'm doing it doesn't work when it should and MUCH more pissed that the fact that I pause on different lines in the debugger makes it behave differently.
[07:48:29] <jeffsmykil_> ScottG you are doing it wrong
[07:48:32] <ScottG> Am I the only one here who finds that absolutely ludicrous?
[07:48:34] <Brodingo> ScottG you can do like $('<option>', {id:'foo', value:'lol'}) or something if you fancy
[07:48:34] <|RicharD|> hello, how i can add a div into body, without remove other divs ?
[07:48:53] <Brodingo> if youre scared of strings
[07:49:02] <ScottG> ajpiano: Let me try that. (It's still stupid for prefering that)
[07:49:03] <jeffsmykil_> richardwhiuk: $("body").append(divvariable);
[07:49:06] <mehwork> i thought jquery 1.8.0 only 'deprecated' support for ie8, not obsoleted it? But i just upgraded to 1.8 and ie8 is giving all kinds of errors in jquery.1.8.0.js such as "object doesn't support method or property 'exec'"
[07:49:10] <|RicharD|> i want only add a div just inside body tag :) without remove other
[07:49:11] <smatt> on http://jsfiddle.net/ukSPX/25/ how can I get it so after it's finished looping all the checkboxes, it'll clear the remaining input fields with any val they have?
[07:49:13] <ajpiano> ScottG: that's how oldIE works
[07:49:19] <ScottG> Brodingo: that's not too bad.
[07:49:19] <ajpiano> it is quirky about setting text of options
[07:49:27] <|RicharD|> jeffsmykil_: is for me ?
[07:49:30] <ajpiano> getting angry about it doesn't really solve anything
[07:49:41] <jeffsmykil_> |RicharD|: indeed
[07:49:45] <|RicharD|> yeah i thunked about append, i wanted confirmed
[07:49:53] <|RicharD|> thx a lot
[07:49:54] <jeffsmykil_> it solved everything for the Hulk ajpiano
[07:50:05] <ajpiano> here's a 6 year old blog post explaining the thing about text vs. innerText in oldIE
[07:50:06] <ajpiano> http://jimkeller.blogspot.com/2006/09/ie-doesnt-show-option-text-when_14.html
[07:50:17] <|RicharD|> thinked*, anyway tnx a lot!
[07:50:21] <sunbeam> return noWeekend[0] ? nationalDays(date) : noWeekend;
[07:50:22] <ScottG> ajpiano: I'm more angry because none of you seem bothered by the fact that pausing on different lines of code in a debugger creates different results. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone where that is normal behavior.
[07:50:24] <sunbeam> what doe sthis mean?
[07:50:29] <sunbeam> dont understand that syntax
[07:50:30] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano: do you have anything in a 2003 vintage
[07:50:51] <jeffsmykil_> if i were in the twighlight zone at least i wouldnt be at work
[07:50:56] <ajpiano> ScottG: no one thinks it's not weird, but the ie debugger suicks
[07:51:07] <jeffsmykil_> sunbeam: thats a ternary expression
[07:51:11] <ajpiano> it doesn't work the same way as firebug or chrome dev tools
[07:51:16] <ajpiano> in that the dom is updated as you step through code
[07:51:30] <pressureman> hi, i'm working on webapp that dynamically creates about 50 list items, and attaches a menu/popup to each of them (using jquery-ui menubar branch). i notice this is quite slow, and have narrowed down the bottleneck to the attaching of the menu. is theoretically possible to only insert the menu elements into the DOM when the popup is opened?
[07:51:33] <anli_> It is becoming stranger and stranger, I have some checkboxes on my webpage with checked="checked". they do not appear checked. when I save the webpage to disk, I get a non-style webpage where the checkboxes that should be checked actually appears checked
[07:51:40] <ajpiano> and it seems that the quirk is related to the particular property you chose to set
[07:52:10] <ajpiano> so the reason some of us may seem irked is because you're saying, i'm in the twilight zone, and we're offering to help you leave the twilight zone, but instead you are asking us to explain WHY the twilight zone is weird
[07:52:23] <ak> any ideas for this: http://jsfiddle.net/keriati/H6BgA/3/ ?
[07:52:24] <ScottG> lol
[07:52:30] <jeffsmykil_> pressureman: where is the menu populated from?
[07:52:33] <Gates> I have 3 lists of text links, these lists are categorized in each of these lists.. I need the ability to have 2 buttons on top that changes the filter based off which one is selected, reorganizing the lists and the items jumping (animated) between lists
[07:53:15] <pressureman> jeffsmykil_, i have written a widget that creates the 50 or so list items, and in the _create function, it attaches the menu elements to the list item and sets up the popup button
[07:53:41] <jeffsmykil_> pressureman why cant you do the populating when you click on the item?
[07:53:52] <jeffsmykil_> and which part is slow the rendering oif the list items?
[07:54:11] <jeffsmykil_> pressureman:  do you have a demo
[07:54:14] <pressureman> jeffsmykil_, that's basically my question.... is it possible to only instantiate the menu the popup open event fires?
[07:54:32] <|RicharD|> there is a simple function for query for take ONE get params ? or i must use regexp ?
[07:54:35] <jeffsmykil_> if i understand you correctly sure
[07:54:57] <pressureman> no demo unfortunately... the data for the list items is retrieved via AJAX from an internal server
[07:55:17] <|RicharD|> for jquery* shitty keyboard
[07:55:33] <pressureman> should i remove the menu from the DOM on popup.close event?
[07:55:45] <haizum> hmm i'm just trying to do a simple if statement, where if ($('#mydiv').hasClass('myclass') == true) { do something and it's not working
[07:55:56] <haizum> the class is being added dynamically
[07:56:00] <haizum> maybe that's why?
[07:56:14] <sunbeam> return noWeekend[0] ? nationalDays(date) : noWeekend; - can anyone example me this syntax?
[07:56:15] <haizum> needs to be an event listener
[07:56:18] <sunbeam> jeffsmykil_: ok but i dont understand it
[07:56:20] <ajpiano> ScottG: furthermore, half the reason jquery came into existence is BECAUSE there were A LOT of places where you'd expect things to "just work right in IE", but in reality IE didn't work right so jquery came along with an API that papers over those differences and makes things "just work"
[07:56:20] <haizum> doesn't it work that way?
[07:56:26] <ScottG> ajpiano: I guess everyone here is just used to IE being crazy and I'm fairly new to web developement and I feel like this sort of behavior is absolutely crazy.
[07:56:48] <ajpiano> so when you opt out of using jQuery in isolated cases for purely aesthetic reasons, and then expect IE to just work anyway
[07:56:56] <ajpiano> yeah, exactly
[07:57:11] <ScottG> ajpiano: Yeah that's a good point. When I'm refactoring I'll definitely keep that in mind and look into templating.
[07:57:34] <ajpiano> hopefully this is an illustrative example for you to understand ie in the context of how it affects web developers, and why jquery exists :)
[07:58:11] <pressureman> jeffsmykil_, using firebug's console.profile(), i isolated the slow code to the menu() call that turns the <ul> etc into the actual menu
[07:58:42] <pressureman> if i comment out that code, so the list items are still generated (by my widget), but just don't have menus, the code is about 10x faster
[07:59:15] <sunbeam> return noWeekend[0] ? nationalDays(date) : noWeekend; - can anyone example me this syntax?
[07:59:18] <sunbeam> explain i mean
[07:59:55] <pressureman> sunbeam, the question mark is used there as the ternary operator
[07:59:56] <ScottG> sunbeam: It's a sort of inline conditional statement
[08:00:37] <ScottG> sunbeam: <condition> ? <executes if condition is true> : <executes if condition is false>
[08:00:52] <ScottG> Or maybe "return" is a better word than "executes"
[08:00:57] <pressureman> yep
[08:01:06] <haizum> ok so my issue is that my if statement is only being run on document load, and not listening afterward for the state change
[08:01:17] <haizum> how do i make it so that its listening always
[08:01:23] <sunbeam> ScottG: ok
[08:01:24] <sunbeam> so
[08:01:39] <sunbeam> if noWeekend[0] is true execute nationalDays else noWeekend
[08:01:40] <sunbeam> right?
[08:01:59] <sunbeam> s/execute/return
[08:02:14] <Gates> Is there an easy way to get those items to jump between lists based off filters?
[08:02:16] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = (1 == 2 ) ? "Hello" : "World"; foo;
[08:02:17] <bot-t> ajpiano: "World"
[08:02:20] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = (1 == 1 ) ? "Hello" : "World"; foo;
[08:02:21] <bot-t> ajpiano: "Hello"
[08:02:44] <ScottG> sunbeam: Yup.
[08:02:57] <sunbeam> ok
[08:05:00] <pangelovski> is it possible to set the width and the height of a page?
[08:05:46] <haizum> i need an event listener for an element attaining a class
[08:05:48] <haizum> how is this possible?
[08:06:06] <haizum> or to be able to make my if statement listen for such a change always
[08:06:42] <skamikaze> haizum: example please ;)
[08:07:07] <smatt> How do I go about storing a set of pairs that need to be referenced (so the data set is 1:abc, 2:xyz, 3:awe. Use case is if 1 is found, it looks it up in set and I can then use abc
[08:07:22] <sunbeam> damn
[08:07:43] <sunbeam> doesn't anyone know how I can give a class to an inline's jquery datepicker dates?
[08:07:47] <sunbeam> to a few dates
[08:07:48] <haizum> http://jsfiddle.net/pZjBE/1/
[08:08:01] <ajpiano> smatt: you use an object
[08:08:04] <haizum> its being run on document load
[08:08:07] <haizum> but not ever again
[08:08:22] <haizum> very simple code
[08:08:38] <smatt> ajpiano: an array of the objects? or just 1 object that contains everything?
[08:08:48] <jeffsmykil_> to overbarring to tell the engineers to stay the fuck out of the css styles page?
[08:09:03] <skamikaze> haizum: what do you want to achieve?
[08:09:09] <ajpiano> jsut one object, it would seem would be necessary from your example
[08:09:21] <haizum> skamikaze, i need that if statement to run true always, not just run once on document load!
[08:09:29] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = {1: "abc", 2: "def", 3: "ghi"};  foo.1;
[08:09:29] <bot-t> ajpiano: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[08:09:55] <haizum> skamikaze: sorry 'run true' is bad terminology, don't get confused. i need it to be 'active' per se
[08:10:03] <skamikaze> haizum: use your javascript debugger and check elements class?
[08:10:12] <pressureman> jeffsmykil_, popup() is supposed to be executed on the menu node (eg. the element to be popped-up), right?
[08:10:12] <haizum> skamikaze: huh?
[08:10:23] <haizum> skamikaze: the statement works fine.
[08:10:26] <smatt> ajpiano: If you've got a minute can you take a quick look at http://jsfiddle.net/ukSPX/43/ should make more sense.
[08:10:26] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = {1: "abc", 2: "def", 3: "ghi"};  foo[1]
[08:10:27] <bot-t> ajpiano: "abc"
[08:10:29] <haizum> skamikaze: it just only runs ONCE
[08:10:44] <jeffsmykil_> pressureman real work calls, I have to help a co-worker sorryh
[08:10:49] <haizum> skamikaze: there must be a way with jquery to have it always in effect
[08:10:52] <skamikaze> haizum: and you want to run that code when .. ?
[08:11:05] <pressureman> no prob... i'll keep playing...
[08:11:09] <haizum> skamikaze: i want it to always listen for that change
[08:11:42] <haizum> skamikaze: i can't use an event because there's no event for an element attaining a class
[08:11:51] <skamikaze> haizum: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.cssHooks/
[08:12:05] <skamikaze> then use display property
[08:12:27] <skamikaze> haizum: that sounds scary anyways ;)
[08:12:28] <ajpiano> smatt: http://jsfiddle.net/ukSPX/46/
[08:12:36] <ajpiano> alright #jquery it has been a fun morning
[08:12:41] <ajpiano> but i also must be parting
[08:13:00] <ajpiano> in the sense of that i won't leave but i also won't be looking unless someone starts flooding the channel, etc
[08:13:01] <ajpiano> :)
[08:13:24] <smatt> ajpiano: thanks very much. That's just what I need
[08:13:25] <haizum> skamikaze: i don't see how that csshooks thing is relevant
[08:13:56] <skamikaze> haizum: you can use setInterval, too
[08:14:05] <_tim|BVB> hey guys, does someone know something about problems with jQuery.on() in Chrome?
[08:14:18] <haizum> skamikaze: ?
[08:14:27] <christophler> Hi. Im using jquery.form plugin to submit a form, and I need a reference to the actual xhttprequest object. Doesnt seem obvious in the docs. Do you know where I can get it?
[08:14:28] <skamikaze> nvm
[08:15:07] <wachpwnski> Hey guys, I have a click event that works the first time through, but the second time it wont flip them again.
[08:17:40] <_tim|BVB> I'm attaching a click event on <option>-tags using jQuery.on(), which works just fine in FF, Opera and even IE. But it doesn't work in Chrome at all, any idea?
[08:20:39] <Gates> How do you make things sortable and jumpable (hehe) from one list to another with the click of a button?
[08:21:15] <|RicharD|> anyone know regexp ? i need to replace all + symbol in one string with jquery
[08:21:21] <|RicharD|> i must use regpex right ?
[08:22:12] <johnkpaul> ?eval "alsjdlaj+alksjd".replace("+","jquery")
[08:22:13] <bot-t> johnkpaul: "alsjdlajjqueryalksjd"
[08:22:17] <johnkpaul> ^ @ |RicharD|
[08:22:44] <christophler> Hi. Im using jquery.form plugin to submit a form, and I need a reference to the actual xhttprequest object. Doesnt seem obvious in the docs. Do you know where I can get it?
[08:22:49] <|RicharD|> so:
[08:23:02] <|RicharD|> if i have a string with word1+word2+word3
[08:23:03] <jjb123> Hey everyone, I'm using jQuery chosen for my new project and I was just wondering if anyone knew how to get the value of the last added item when responding to the "change" event.
[08:23:06] <|RicharD|> i can do
[08:23:17] <|RicharD|> string.replace("+", " ")
[08:23:24] <|RicharD|> for have: word1 word2 word32 ?
[08:23:32] <johnkpaul> ?tias @|RicharD|
[08:23:33] <bot-t> |RicharD|, Try It And See
[08:23:37] <|RicharD|> thx
[08:24:00] <BoBsoN> hello.
[08:24:04] <jjb123> I tried just doing this.value inside of my on('change') function but it seemed too be inconsistent (sometimes would give the wrong value)
[08:24:22] <johnkpaul> christophler: you mean from .ajaxForm?
[08:24:27] <BoBsoN> anyone know why jQuery dont see id's which are set by jQuery .prop() ?
[08:24:49] <|RicharD|> johnkpaul: no not works :(
[08:25:33] <Clex> |RicharD|: what do you want to do?
[08:25:46] <johnkpaul> ?eval "word1+word2+word3".replace(/[+]/g," ")
[08:25:47] <bot-t> johnkpaul: "word1 word2 word3"
[08:25:50] <johnkpaul> ^ @ |RicharD|
[08:25:52] <|RicharD|> i have this message: Jquery+rocks
[08:26:01] <|RicharD|> i want: Jquery rocks
[08:26:37] <johnkpaul> christophler: the return value of ajax is jqXHR which is a superset of a regular xhr - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[08:26:59] <|RicharD|> oki works
[08:27:07] <|RicharD|> but why /[+]/g ?
[08:28:16] <|RicharD|> ah is a regxp, thx :)
[08:28:24] <_tim|BVB> I'm attaching a click event on <option>-tags using jQuery.on(), which works just fine in FF, Opera and even IE. But it doesn't work in Chrome at all, any idea?
[08:28:34] <vict0ria> anyone knows any adobe flash (.swf to be exact) support channel
[08:29:58] <BoBsoN> someone can look at it and tell why jQuery has such strange behavior with those ID's? http://pastebin.com/YuVeLp6c
[08:31:39] <johnkpaul> BoBsoN: take a look at the docs for selectors
[08:31:46] <johnkpaul> there are special rules for special characters
[08:35:52] <belak> Can anyone recommend some decent beginners' books on jQuery and Javascript? I'm trying to compile a list for some new students in CS...
[08:36:00] <BoBsoN> johnkpaul: thx :) i forget that I can make selector from ID+class at once :)
[08:36:25] <johnkpaul> you _can_, but not straightforward if the id has a . in it
[08:36:31] <johnkpaul> ?learn @ belak
[08:36:32] <bot-t> belak, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[08:37:26] <belak> johnkpaul: I was thinking ebooks, in particular... but I suppose that works
[08:37:42] <johnkpaul> jqfundamentals is basically an ebook
[08:38:08] <johnkpaul> it's creative commons licenced, I'm pretty sure you can make it a PDF is that's what you need
[08:39:37] <belak> Heh. That git repo is listed as not supported, so it points to a jquery repo and a site that isn't up yet.
[08:41:00] <johnkpaul> belak: yeah, learn.jquery.com is still being put together
[08:41:17] <johnkpaul> but the content in jqfundamentals is still useful
[08:43:00] <belak> Ok
[08:43:03] <belak> Thanks
[08:48:01] <xid> holy netsplits
[08:48:55] <xid> anyone know of an input field character counter plugin that calculates the total of multiple fields and counts down from a total maximum?
[08:49:01] <xid> i can think of how to code it on my own
[08:49:09] <xid> but i'd like to be done with this in like ten minutes
[08:49:11] <xid> if possible
[08:51:46] <Gates> Can you use sortable with links?
[08:53:20] <Gates> I have disabled the drag and drop using "disabled: true" and need to have the sort based off a click now
[08:57:06] <Gates> Yea i have no idea
[08:57:17] <Jagst3r15> should I use jquery to add a cool effect where the title slides in from the right when you hover on the image? http://jagst3r15.com
[08:58:09] <deximat> xid there?
[09:00:41] <shadykhan> Hey guys so i can understand peoples jquery code with little to no problems but im still having problems actually writing some complex things.  What can i do to fix that?
[09:01:39] <Gates> I have these 3 lists of items, I need to make them jump between lists based off clicking links that filter (at the top) - http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[09:01:58] <Gates> i got the sortable working and drag/drop disabled but do not know how to get started with the links
[09:02:08] <Eviltwin> shadykhan: Practice writing more
[09:02:21] <Eviltwin> shadykhan: Try to break down your problem into pieces that can be attacked separately
[09:07:11] <shoky> Gates: not sure what you want to be happening there..
[09:07:30] <Gates> the 3 lists change sort
[09:07:38] <Gates> so some text from col2 goto col1
[09:07:42] <Gates> etc
[09:07:51] <shoky> yeah, no idea what that means.
[09:08:09] <shoky> some logic would be nice ;]
[09:08:52] <Gates> You see the 3 lists?
[09:09:01] <multipass> hey, is it possible to pull the <scripts> from a page via ajax? right now .load is stripping out all the scripts that I want
[09:09:08] <shoky> anyway, to move something from one list to another, you just move it  (with .detach() and .append() for example)
[09:09:14] <Gates> On click of typeY I want "Real Time Analytics" to go from col2 to col1
[09:09:17] <shoky> er or just append() actually
[09:09:20] <multipass> the scrits are just done inline in the document, so im not sure about getScripts
[09:09:42] <Gates> i am able to add new iteams using append
[09:09:48] <astropirate> multipass, if the scrip is in the html document itself within <script> tags, you can get them by just querying for it
[09:09:55] <astropirate> $('script').each()  etc etc
[09:09:56] <Gates> so I guess i just need to learn to detach i guess
[09:10:22] <multipass> astropirate: well its in the document that Im grabbing via ajax
[09:11:43] <shoky> Gates: you don't even need to detach
[09:11:55] <shoky> Gates: simple example... http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gQhtw/8/
[09:11:58] <Gates> well theres so many items shoky  how do i keep track of them all?
[09:12:00] <astropirate> multipass, ohh thats differentish
[09:12:21] <shoky> Gates: i have no idea what the logic behind your "filtering"/sorting is ?
[09:12:37] <Gates> astropirate: can i just put like an array or class or something that says which list them belong to on sort?
[09:12:39] <shoky> Gates: so no idea what to answer..
[09:12:40] <multipass> so basically, I have a page that will ajax load a different page for every nav item.. but in those ajax loaded pages is inline javascript. How can I load this?
[09:12:40] <astropirate> multipass, i guess the solution is very dependent on what you are working with
[09:12:43] <Gates> and then it just pulls the info?
[09:12:56] <wachpwnski> for some reason my script will only do one go about. and I have tried live and bind
[09:13:15] <Gates> Let me build the 2nd list at the bottom to give you the idea of the 2 possible results
[09:13:42] <astropirate> wachpwnski, elaborate. or better yet, create a jsfiddle
[09:16:14] <shoky> Gates: i dont understand also what the .sortable() is even for..
[09:16:32] <shoky> if its disabled
[09:16:39] <Gates> me either
[09:16:40] <Gates> lol
[09:16:47] <shoky> then remove it ;)
[09:16:56] <shoky> until you know that you need it
[09:17:14] <wachpwnski> astropirate: http://jsfiddle.net/uc5gx/1/ it should go from activate to deactivate and back to activate again
[09:18:35] <astropirate> wachpwnski, you aren't updating th eURL
[09:19:44] <wachpwnski> astropirate:  what does this do then? target_anchor.attr("href", url);
[09:22:43] <multipass> is there any good way to request all the <script> from a document via ajax? "getScript" acts a little weird and only picks up scripts if they are at the beginning of the document
[09:24:04] <astropirate> wachpwnski, ahhh
[09:24:10] <astropirate> its suppose to b e url =
[09:24:15] <astropirate> url = url.replace
[09:24:27] <astropirate> let the silliness of JS continue!
[09:24:46] <wachpwnski> ok, now why doesn't my anchor text change after the first transition?
[09:24:58] <astropirate> it does
[09:24:59] <wachpwnski> This is why I hate javascript, jQuery does make it better
[09:25:06] <wachpwnski> it only changes once
[09:25:11] <astropirate> wachpwnski, http://jsfiddle.net/uc5gx/3/
[09:25:14] <wachpwnski> it doesn't change over and over after each click
[09:25:43] <Zzaichik> how can you hate javascript and love jquery?
[09:26:10] <astropirate> multipass, i'm confused as to what you want to do. do you want to load JS scripts onto the dom after page load
[09:26:27] <multipass> yeah astropirate
[09:26:42] <multipass> but these scripts are at the bottom of the page im calling
[09:27:00] <multipass> and so getScripts dosnt work
[09:27:04] <multipass> if i move them to the top then getScript works
[09:27:06] <astropirate> i seee
[09:27:11] <Gates> shoky: I made a list of both sorts
[09:27:16] <Gates> would that be helpful?
[09:27:38] <astropirate> so the paths to the scripts are in a script tag within another html page?
[09:27:44] <shoky> Gates: what would be helpful is if you explain what you actually want going on.. and not "uhh some items should go somewhere from some list"
[09:28:33] <astropirate> wachpwnski, is tha what yo wanted?
[09:29:22] <multipass> astropirate: im ajaxing a page in for its content.. but the scripts also exist on that page
[09:29:35] <shoky> Gates: but if you updated the fiddle you can share the link too
[09:29:39] <multipass> so right now im .load the page.. then doing .getScript
[09:29:44] <Gates> kk
[09:30:31] <Gates> shoky: here is the 2 sets of lists, http://pastebin.com/Gxyt8LCH
[09:30:48] <Gates> all of the items between the two are the same under different headings
[09:31:36] <shoky> starting to make some sense now..
[09:31:57] <astropirate> multipass, ok, so what you do is make an ajax call to yoru second HTML page, you get the "data" variable in yoru callback. wrap that in jquery and find yoru script
[09:32:14] <astropirate> $(data).find('script') << will give you a list of all the scripts on the page
[09:32:47] <shoky> Gates: well your fiddle doesn't have all of the properties of the items. e.g. it doesnt have the info that "Web analytics" is part of the Analytics department, and also is a Marketing service
[09:33:04] <shoky> and same for all other items
[09:33:20] <shoky> i guess you could say you have one of those properties (the subcat..)
[09:35:25] <Gates> Yes
[09:35:51] <sunbeam> woiw
[09:35:52] <sunbeam> wow
[09:35:56] <sunbeam> any datepicker users in here?
[09:36:12] <Gates> so can i do like filter-X="cat-Y"
[09:36:26] <Gates> and filter-A="cat-B"
[09:36:27] <astropirate> multipass, so if you get that part. then what you do is just create a new script elemtn in your current document's DOM for each of those scripts that you want.
[09:36:29] <fparreira> hi, i am brasilian. This is the my first connect in the room
[09:36:42] <astropirate> fparreira, welcome
[09:36:58] <fparreira> tanks
[09:37:59] <Gates> shoky: so  can i just add like an attr in the html or something?
[09:39:02] <sunbeam> http://pastebin.com/D9Q6x3mD
[09:39:10] <sunbeam> does anyone see whats wrong here?
[09:39:12] <Jagst3r15> can someone tell me how to get started adding jquery here so the title is hidden initally and then when the image is hovered over it slides in from the right? http://jagst3r15.com/
[09:39:14] <sunbeam> and why the alert doesnt get executed?
[09:39:23] <Jagst3r15> any advice is appreciated
[09:40:13] <multipass> astropirate: because this website is dynamic and that cant work :|
[09:42:24] <shoky> Gates: that's one way.. but ideally you'd have your data in some JS datastructure and work with that
[09:42:48] <sunbeam> http://pastebin.com/D9Q6x3mD - does anyone see what here might be wrong?
[09:43:02] <Gates> shoky: hmm just a basic array?
[09:44:53] <Gates> shoky: like an array inside the array? each object (title) holding the link, sort1, sort2?
[09:45:22] <shoky> Gates: yea something like that
[09:45:46] <shoky> but it doesnt hold links, it holds data
[09:46:07] <shoky> if by links you meant <a>s
[09:47:16] <Gates> shoky: links being URLs
[09:48:00] <shoky> Gates: if you got a big dataset and need to manipulate it in the view and show it different ways.. there might be plugins that could help you.. i dont really know which are good tho
[09:48:41] <Gates> i cant find any good ones
[09:49:04] <shoky> i've seen lots of people use datatables.. no idea if its good or suitable tho
[09:49:12] <KWhat_Work> Why does .find(':[name="mytextbox"]') not work anymore?  Returns "unrecognized expression" ?
[09:49:21] <shoky> KWhat_Work: remove the colon :
[09:50:25] <KWhat_Work> shoky: huh, did the api change?
[09:50:54] <shoky> KWhat_Work:  there's no colon selector, i dont think there was one
[09:51:05] <shoky> KWhat_Work: what do you expect it to be doing..
[09:51:19] <KWhat_Work> shoky: it use to work prior to 1.8
[09:51:26] <shoky> KWhat_Work: it used to work and do what?
[09:51:40] <shoky> KWhat_Work: follow the API docs.
[09:52:00] <KWhat_Work> same thing without the colon... huh i could have sworn thats where i got it from
[09:52:19] <shoky> KWhat_Work: the colon is used for other selectors, not for the attribute selector..
[09:52:55] <KWhat_Work> shoky: so does tag[attribute]
[09:53:03] <Gates> shoky: the LI can jump between ULs? thus the A href stay with each LI?
[09:53:06] <shoky> KWhat_Work: what?
[09:53:24] <Gates> shoky: i rather just make 2 extra HTML attrs and have them sort based off that, is that easy?
[09:53:24] <shoky> Gates: hm?
[09:53:29] <KWhat_Work> never mind got it
[09:54:09] <shoky> Gates: its not too hard..
[09:54:26] <Gates> okay
[09:54:34] <Gates> shoky: should they be two atts? or one?
[09:55:13] <shoky> Gates: up to you...
[09:55:21] <Gates> I guess this <li data-sort-department="col1" data-sort-services="col3" ...
[09:55:27] <Gates> that makes the most sens to me
[09:55:40] <Gates> (match "col1" to the class name of course)
[10:01:05] <astropirate> multipass, define dynamic
[10:05:17] <jacta> back - did anyone get my question?
[10:05:36] <Gates> shoky: okay so this makes sense then? http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[10:07:32] <shoky> Gates: i dono.. if it does to you
[10:07:42] <Gates> it doesnt do anything
[10:07:51] <Gates> im not sure how to get it to resort based on the information it knows now
[10:08:01] <jQuery_> Guys, I keep getting the following error:
[10:08:10] <Gates> resort == change to the correct UL lists**
[10:08:12] <jQuery_> "Object [object Object] has no method 'ajaxSubmit'"
[10:08:47] <ekpyrotic> Sorry, about nick.
[10:09:20] <ekpyrotic> So, I get an error "Object [object Object] has no method 'ajaxSubmit'" using the validation plugin.
[10:09:41] <shoky> Gates: here's a really simple, inefficient, not-worked-out way to use data for populating the view: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gQhtw/14/
[10:09:55] <shoky> maybe you can work with that.. donno
[10:11:06] <Gates> shoky: is there a way to make a LI animate from one column to the next?
[10:11:54] <shoky> mm.. doesn't sound like a trivial thing to do. but maybe it is, dono
[10:12:38] <shoky> if i wanted that effect i'd just position all the elements myself absolutely
[10:12:47] <shoky> so it'd be easier to work with
[10:14:06] <jaysern> Hi all, I'm trying to figure out how to use $.when() with Deferreds, and I'm trying to execute the functions (that return Deferreds) inside of the $.when() declaration, but am stuck here: http://jsfiddle.net/VDUjT/1/
[10:14:44] <shoky> jaysern: $.when.apply($, arrayOfDeferreds).then(.... )
[10:14:57] <jaysern> ah
[10:15:01] <jaysern> thanks!
[10:15:43] <shoky> np
[10:15:44] <Gates> shoky: this doenst work but this is more along the lines of what I was thinking... http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[10:16:03] <shoky> Gates: why are you still using .sortable() ?
[10:16:07] <shoky> "using"
[10:16:13] <Gates> hehe i dont know
[10:16:15] <shoky> :\
[10:16:19] <Gates> doesnt it allow for the animation?
[10:16:29] <shoky> where did you read that?
[10:16:47] <Gates> past conversations with people, i am possibly wrong
[10:17:01] <Gates> i was told to use sortable, then detach and append it
[10:17:43] <shoky> you use sortable when you want the drag/drop stuff
[10:17:53] <shoky> afaik
[10:19:18] <Gates> i guess that would make more sense
[10:19:39] <Gates> I thought sortable was different hten drag and drop because theres other drag drop functions
[10:19:49] <Gates> and that sortable was kind of freely floating object or something
[10:20:09] <Gates> shoky: ^
[10:20:49] <shoky> sortable is drag&drop of items in lists or in-between lists
[10:20:59] <Gates> The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse
[10:21:01] <Gates> yes you are right
[10:21:54] <shoky> and of course, if its disabled its of no use either way ;p
[10:22:04] <Sicp> I can write as many JS files as I want and just link to them in other files whenever I want to use functions provided in them/
[10:22:06] <Sicp> ?*
[10:23:01] <Gates> shoky: well then i feel dumb
[10:23:35] <shoky> Gates: nah don't. i've seen much worse :P
[10:24:19] <Gates> oh yes me too -hehe
[10:24:26] <Gates> shoky: how can i make this work since it has all the data it needs, http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[10:24:27] <jacta> anyone that can help me?
[10:28:17] <splig> hi there. why doing $.get(window.location.pathname, function(data) the data received is only a piece of the actual page???
[10:28:26] <splig> shouldnt i receive all completly?
[10:28:43] <someprimetime> depends what you're sending back
[10:28:51] <someprimetime> you using contents()?
[10:29:57] <splig> well... i do a post and when it succeed i want to reload two parts of my page. then i do the line i said and $("#tabs #payment").html($(data).find("#tabs #payment").html());
[10:30:17] <splig> this works, because it's part of the response i get. the other similar instruction doesnt, because is not in the response
[10:30:24] <splig> but i dont  dont know why
[10:31:15] <chovy> splig: can you paste a fiddle?
[10:31:21] <shoky> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gQhtw/17/   you didn't close the .each(   and also you use $.each instead of $(...).each
[10:31:25] <shoky> used*
[10:32:20] <Gates> hehe woops
[10:32:22] <shoky> Gates: and don't use ids for data stuff.  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gQhtw/18/
[10:32:38] <shoky> use data-XX all the way, and then you can easily fetch them with .data(..)
[10:33:44] <splig> chovy, http://pastebin.com/hKF2rXeq
[10:34:07] <splig> i hope it helps. on jsfiddle i dont get it :P
[10:37:01] <splig> the thing is if i inspect value of data when i start the callback function, this is a junk of html code. not complete webpage
[10:37:10] <splig> so #menu is not there
[10:37:18] <Gates> shoky: oh crpa, thanks
[10:37:25] <Gates> crap*
[10:39:15] <Gates> shoky: so i can do that same thing with the heading then>?
[10:39:37] <shoky> Gates: why not
[10:41:01] <Gates> idk because of the spaces?
[10:41:40] <shoky> what spaces
[10:43:42] <Gates> not 2 words its one, in the heading
[10:44:25] <shoky> same with the <li>s no?
[10:46:46] <aniasis> when I add $.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg(); to a bound click event the loading message doesn't show in a phonegap application.
[10:46:51] <aniasis> Does anyone know why?
[10:47:08] <Gates> shoky: why doesnt the h3 change here? http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[10:47:38] <shoky> Gates: $("span.catcolWrap h3").eachfunction
[10:47:54] <shoky> Gates: look at your javascript console from time to time... (or all the time)
[10:48:22] <Gates> good point
[10:49:59] <Gates> Now to figure out the ticky part, having it move from one list to another..
[10:50:26] <Gates> shoky: suggestions?
[10:50:44] <shoky> it?
[10:51:00] <Gates> a object? l<li>
[10:51:17] <shoky> isn't that what your code is doing? moving li's from list to list?
[10:51:42] <splig> chovy, someprimetime some idea??
[10:51:58] <shoky> Gates: oh you mean the animation?
[10:52:05] <Gates> for the tricky part, create a visual animation of the LI between ULs
[10:52:24] <aniasis> This is a known issue but there doesn't seem to be any fixes for it.
[10:52:27] <shoky> yea that's tricky.. and potentially ugly-looking ;)
[10:52:38] <Gates> let me show you this
[10:52:39] <shoky> lots of lis sliding from place to place simultaneously? ;)
[10:53:12] <Gates> http://razorjack.net/quicksand/
[10:53:29] <Gates> well its a foreach lopos so its really 1 by 1
[10:53:40] <Gates> (sorry my chrome is lagging so much I cannot type)
[10:53:54] <shoky> Gates: yea good luck with the animation :D
[10:54:10] <Gates> fml
[10:54:57] <paulschreiber> In MSIE9, I'm getting a "SCRIPT5: Access is denied." error. I looked around the query forums, google, stackoverflow, etc. Everyone else is hitting this when they call ajax. I'm hitting it when I call prependTo
[10:55:09] <shoky> Gates: like i said before, if i wanted to have control over animating everything, i'd use absolute positioning for everything (at least during the animation)
[10:55:16] <shoky> Gates: but still, it's tricky.
[10:55:39] <shoky> paulschreiber: calling prependTo on what? with what?
[10:58:38] <paulschreiber> shoky: $(bar).prependTo baz
[10:58:38] <paulschreiber> bar = "<input type='hidden' …>"
[10:58:38] <paulschreiber> baz is is a fieldset
[10:58:51] <xid> deximat: I ended up coding something that worked
[10:58:53] <xid> thanks
[10:59:58] <shoky> paulschreiber: got a demo/fiddle?
[11:00:18] <shoky> Gates: btw what you're doing is grouping-by,  not filtering
[11:00:28] <paulschreiber> shoky: you can see it live on turbovote.net/register/basics
[11:00:31] <Gates> touche.
[11:00:46] <paulschreiber> that's with minifed js, etc. so not good for debugging
[11:01:18] <Gates> its too bad since its appending it to somewhere else you cant just add  an animation (function?)
[11:01:25] <Gates> I ugess I can just loop up how to annimate append?
[11:04:13] <paulschreiber> the other weird thing about the problem is if you reload the page, it goes away
[11:05:10] <Gates> shoky: u cant animate .append() with jquery?
[11:06:09] <Eviltwin> Gates: Uh, no
[11:06:20] <Eviltwin> It's the DOM
[11:06:22] <Gates> :\ but its moving an object from "here" to "there"
[11:06:27] <Eviltwin> An element is either there or not
[11:06:53] <Gates> so its saying in its current state remove form Y and in its new state add to X
[11:06:56] <Gates> from Y *
[11:07:17] <Eviltwin> You can make something that looks like you animated append but you can't actually animate it directly
[11:07:49] <Gates> As long as the LI visually moving from one UL to another UL and looks like it jumped, thats all I care about
[11:08:06] <splig> do you know if i use .get() (see http://pastebin.com/hKF2rXeq) the data returned is not the complete html code?? just a bit of it??
[11:08:56] <Gates> Eviltwin: ...using i assume absolute? as shoky said and i am seeing in google searches?
[11:09:01] <Eviltwin> Yes
[11:09:39] <Gates> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[11:09:55] <Gates> if its moving both LEFT and RIGHT how do I know how to do such absolute
[11:12:04] <paulschreiber>       try
[11:12:04] <paulschreiber>         $input = $(this.hiddenInputHTML(name, id, classes)).prependTo $scope
[11:12:04] <paulschreiber>       catch err
[11:12:04] <paulschreiber>         window.location.reload() if $.msie
[11:12:04] <paulschreiber> that seems to fix it
[11:14:27] <jaysern> I have 2 ajax calls, where the in the 1st ajax call's success callback, I may make another 20 ajax calls (depending on the results of that 1st call). How do I do a .when() when all 22 ajax calls return?
[11:15:14] <Embalmed> Hey guys, i'm having an issue with jquery validate to validate an IP address.  Using this pretty much:  http://www.devcurry.com/2010/04/validate-ip-address-using-jquery.html
[11:15:36] <astropirate> jaysern, there is a nice library for things like that called  async.js  give it a try
[11:15:44] <Embalmed> it works, but if i submit a bad ip address, it shows invalid IP address, if i change it to a valid IP, i can't submit it just keeps saying Invalid IP and won't let me submit
[11:15:58] <shoky> paulschreiber: interesting.. but yea, kinda impossible to debug with minified ;p
[11:16:11] <Embalmed> its like the validate function isn't being called a second time, or it never forgets what was in the field to begin with
[11:18:34] <jaysern> astropirate: hmm, i'm not familiar with async.js - looking into it more. I guess this is not something jQuery handles natively?
[11:19:29] <astropirate> jaysern, not, it works with any javascript code. its very easy to get started with
[11:20:52] <splig> resolved. i already go entiry html code, but it does not work. $("#menu").html($(data).find("#menu").html());. #menu is outside the div where i generate the event from, is it a problem?? #menu is child of body
[11:21:03] <Eviltwin> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/WaeAZ/
[11:21:32] <pachet> jaysern: actually, jquery *can* handle it without having to resort to another library
[11:21:37] <pachet> via the promises interface
[11:22:13] <Eviltwin> Gates: In fact I think you can simplify: http://jsfiddle.net/WaeAZ/1/
[11:22:38] <Eviltwin> In the past I used position: absolute but this one uses position: relative instead
[11:22:40] <pachet> var deferred_actions = [$.load('foo'), $.load('bar')]; $.when.apply(this, deferred_actions).then(some_callback)
[11:22:43] <pachet> jaysern^
[11:22:46] <Eviltwin> Which seems to be easier
[11:22:59] <Eviltwin> $.when.apply($, deferred_actions).then(some_callback)
[11:23:06] <Eviltwin> jaysern, pachet: ^
[11:23:18] <pachet> Eviltwin: oh good catch, z
[11:23:19] <Embalmed> http://pastebin.com/rujsxDjE
[11:23:53] <Gates> Eviltwin: YES! thats exactly what I am looking to do!1
[11:23:59] <Eviltwin> I know
[11:24:17] <Gates> hahaha
[11:24:29] <Gates> Eviltwin: and then to do it using my script over and over in a foreach loop
[11:24:33] <Gates> i think i sent u my script?
[11:24:52] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I kinda hate working with other people's code though
[11:24:59] <Eviltwin> And since I'm just volunteering, I don't have to :D
[11:25:12] <Eviltwin> Just look at what I'm doing, it's not too complicated
[11:25:36] <Gates> hshsh yerds
[11:25:37] <Gates> yes*
[11:25:48] <Gates> i cant type obvi
[11:27:12] <jaysern> ok, I'm not sure if this is normal, but I have an array of functions (that return a deferred object - which in them, I define a .done() success callback for each of them )). Next, I call $.when.apply() on this array, the .then() fires - indicating it all went well, but the success callbacks in the .done() doesn't fire. Is that normal?
[11:27:36] <shoky> nope
[11:27:38] <Gates> Eviltwin: im having a little trouble following your code :[
[11:27:42] <Gates> hi2u shoky
[11:27:46] <shoky> hiz
[11:27:49] <Embalmed> anyone have an idea why my validation is not submitting after correcting the fiels?
[11:28:07] <shoky> Gates: he first appends the <li> to the second list, thereby actually moving it already to the new position.
[11:28:21] <Eviltwin> Well
[11:28:26] <Eviltwin> I first record the position things are in
[11:28:28] <shoky> Gates: and then right away animates from the old pos to the new pos
[11:28:28] <shoky> yeah
[11:28:29] <Eviltwin> Make the movement
[11:28:43] <Eviltwin> Then use relative positioning to make things look like they're where they used to be
[11:28:51] <Eviltwin> And animate to their new location
[11:28:57] <Gates> well since there are only 2 "states" i can get the current and new easily?
[11:29:30] <Eviltwin> The important thing to realize is that the instant the animation starts, the element is really already in its destination location
[11:29:39] <Gates> yes
[11:29:46] <shoky> oh you're looping over all lis
[11:29:50] <Eviltwin> Yes
[11:30:54] <Gates> which is why i am confused maybe
[11:31:08] <Eviltwin> So the <li>s can change position
[11:31:13] <Eviltwin> And nothing else can
[11:31:26] <Eviltwin> I'm recording the position of everything that can change position
[11:32:42] <Gates> and the setting of data before that i cannot see because i am not as savvy
[11:33:02] <Eviltwin> You can't see the setting or you can't see why I'm setting?
[11:33:37] <Gates> Cant i get the offset() before i move it, then get the offset() after I move it, then animate the move?
[11:34:00] <Eviltwin> That's what I'm doing
[11:34:19] <Eviltwin> But the problem is that the element you're .append-ing is not the only thing that's moving
[11:35:13] <Gates> Eviltwin: so more like this, http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[11:35:27] <shoky> lol
[11:35:35] <Gates> dont hate
[11:35:39] <Gates> its at least moving =[
[11:35:39] <Eviltwin> Well that's not working :P
[11:35:50] <Gates> ..im trying :P
[11:35:59] <Eviltwin> So here's the problem
[11:36:19] <Eviltwin> Doing the $(gotoCol).append(item); can change the position of later <li>s
[11:36:35] <Gates> isnt that how i get the before and after?
[11:36:36] <Eviltwin> Which is why I have separate loops
[11:36:43] <Gates> ohhh
[11:37:10] <Eviltwin> You're doing get before 1, move 1, get after 1, get before 2, move 2, get after 2, ...
[11:37:35] <Eviltwin> I'm doing get before 1, get before 2, ... move 1, get after 1, move 2, get after 2, ...
[11:37:44] <Gates> ohhh
[11:37:56] <Embalmed> stupid jquery validate what is your problem
[11:38:00] <Gates> so i need to split the before and the move/after
[11:38:07] <Gates> Eviltwin: thats the solution then? ^
[11:38:10] <Eviltwin> And in fact you may want to do get before 1, get before 2, ... move 1, move 2, ..., get after 1, get after 2, ...
[11:38:23] <Eviltwin> Since you're moving more than one element at once
[11:38:28] <Gates> 3 loops
[11:38:36] <Eviltwin> Like my v0
[11:38:51] <jaysern> here's my inner + outer deferred, plus their respective success callbacks where only the outer .done() fires http://jsfiddle.net/n676W/1/
[11:41:28] <shoky> jaysern:  dfd_arr.push(get_dfd2());
[11:41:35] <Eviltwin> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/28/
[11:41:42] <Eviltwin> Battery ran out on my laptop
[11:41:45] <Eviltwin> Good luck!
[11:42:03] <Gates> thanks
[11:42:07] <Gates> Eviltwin: yours is better than mine
[11:42:12] <Gates> mine likes to jump from teh bottom right ..lol

[11:42:30] <givudean> i need help correcting a text input value, already calculated by a js function
[11:42:34] <Gates> i can just compare i guess
[11:42:38] <jaysern> shoky: interesting .. but doesn't it execute get_dfd2 right there and then?
[11:42:54] <jaysern> when the when.apply is supposed to execute it later?
[11:43:07] <Embalmed> :(
[11:43:09] <shoky> jaysern: also you're not doing anything with that inner dfd2 (except resolving it)
[11:43:51] <givudean> smbd can help me?
[11:44:21] <shoky> jaysern: $.when expects deferreds(or promises), not functions..
[11:45:11] <jaysern> ah. so I execute the function so that the deferreds or promises return, so I have an array of that, not an array of functions
[11:45:17] <jaysern> thanks!
[11:45:21] <Gates> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/ hehe
[11:45:24] <shoky> yea
[11:45:45] <Gates> too bad when you click the "department" after "services" there is weird lines at the bottom.. do you see those too?
[11:45:48] <shoky> Gates: nice ;>
[11:46:00] <ryanneufeld> Mozilla is stepping it up! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfXcXcEHL0&feature=player_embedded
[11:46:16] <shoky> Gates: lines where?
[11:46:16] <Gates> shoky: needs some easing to smooth it
[11:46:25] <Eviltwin> !
[11:46:42] <Eviltwin> Totally forgot about my beer fund! http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[11:46:44] <Jagst3r15> any idea how i'd make this slide in rather than fade in? http://pastie.org/4618045

[11:47:21] <shoky> Gates: you using chrome non-stable ?
[11:47:26] <Gates> it is
[11:47:29] <Gates> but do you see it?
[11:47:37] <Gates> Eviltwin: ill be throwing for you and shoky you too
[11:47:41] <shoky> yeah, that's chrome glitches ..
[11:47:47] <shoky> i believe
[11:47:57] <shoky> i've been seeing them for months now on aninmations
[11:48:13] <shoky> if you resize the window/frame they'll be gone
[11:48:14] <Gates> yea prob.. and easing with make it smother?
[11:48:16] <Eviltwin> I'll take a look when I find power for my laptop. I'm on from my phone right now.
[11:48:26] <Gates> Eviltwin: hehe
[11:49:36] <youjay> hi all
[11:50:39] <youjay> does anyone know of any scripts that animate nodes shapes or something similar? Basically I want to create a landing page that has a subtle effect
[11:50:53] <Gates> thanks Andrew -hehe
[11:53:55] <brl0> gs
[11:57:31] <Embalmed> so apparently nobody knows anything about jquery validate pluging
[11:57:32] <Embalmed> plugin
[11:58:39] <Eviltwin> Hmm... still not to my goal on that Pledgie campaign
[12:00:57] <jaysern> thanks for all the help, guys. really appreciate it
[12:01:23] <shoky> lol Eviltwin
[12:02:00] <shoky> isn't FB giving you enough beer cash ;P
[12:02:13] <Eviltwin> That was an internship and it ended :'(
[12:02:21] <Embalmed> can someone please tell me why my jquery validate plugin will not submit the form after correcting the field errors?
[12:02:23] <Eviltwin> But they want me back next year
[12:02:25] <shoky> ohh :(
[12:02:25] <Eviltwin> So that's good
[12:02:27] <shoky> yay
[12:02:41] <shoky> ok you got my donation then
[12:03:32] <shoky> and now <Gates> thanks Andrew -hehe
[12:03:33] <shoky> makes sense
[12:03:54] <Gates> Eviltwin: that isnt a real number?
[12:04:14] <givudean> can smbd help to change content of a text input when is clicking on a submit button>?
[12:04:19] <Gates> shoky: yes
[12:06:30] <Gates> now to add easing, shouldnt be too bad
[12:07:07] <pothibo> is there an event that is fired when a dom object as been created? Like an ajax call that returns <li> tags and I want to attach an object to all of them
[12:08:05] <Eviltwin> Gates: Easing for which?
[12:08:29] <pothibo> something along the line of $("li.calendar-event").on("DOMContentLoaded", function() {//code})
[12:08:31] <Gates> Eviltwin: allow me to formalize, can i make the animation smoother?
[12:08:49] <Eviltwin> You mean the movement between the columns?
[12:08:53] <Gates> yes
[12:09:22] <Eviltwin> Gates: Well you could slow it down: http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/32/
[12:09:35] <Gates> smoothness not speed
[12:09:50] <Eviltwin> Well how do you define smoothness in your case?
[12:09:55] <Eviltwin> I think it's already ease-in-out
[12:10:02] <shoky> speed often has a great effect on perceived smoothness
[12:10:06] <Eviltwin> Yes
[12:10:37] <Gates> remove the alg and choppy
[12:10:40] <Gates> lag*
[12:11:14] <Gates> i mean smooth like the start to finish it constant and not coppy
[12:11:17] <Gates> choppy* omg
[12:11:41] <Eviltwin> Is this any less choppy for you? http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/33/
[12:11:43] <Gates> if anything the "fast" (original) is less choppy because it has less time to mess up
[12:12:02] <Eviltwin> It looked smooth before for me but I am on an 8x 2.7GHz i7 chip
[12:12:54] <Gates> Eviltwin: a bit
[12:12:57] <Gates> compare these:
[12:12:57] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/34/
[12:13:03] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/35/
[12:13:21] <Gates> 34 looks to be a touch smoother (less-choppy)
[12:13:41] <Eviltwin> What I did was make it not animate if it's not going to move
[12:13:48] <Gates> actually they are the same
[12:13:57] <Gates> but the first one doesnt lag up when you press it a lot
[12:14:05] <Eviltwin> These are both super smooth for me
[12:14:08] <Gates> added a check, yes i see
[12:14:31] <shoky> not getting any lag/choppiness here either
[12:16:32] <Gates> i assume we all have powerful machines?
[12:17:09] <Gates> shoky / Eviltwin : suggestions on a nice clean animation for the title change? instead of just POP!
[12:17:30] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[12:17:36] <shoky> crossfade? fadeout/in?
[12:17:41] <Gates> maybe just a fade back and forth?
[12:17:44] <Gates> yea thats what im thinking
[12:18:21] <j2000> hi
[12:18:37] <Eviltwin> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/39/
[12:19:07] <Gates> too much?
[12:19:31] <Eviltwin> Your call
[12:20:08] <Gates> it feels like it
[12:20:17] <Gates> is it possible to do the fade in and out at the same time?
[12:20:27] <Eviltwin> You mean a cross-fade?
[12:20:42] <shoky> that usually works better for graphic content
[12:21:00] <shoky> (but yeah, its possible)
[12:21:16] <Eviltwin> It requires two elements though
[12:21:37] <Gates> hehe yea
[12:21:51] <Gates> well the reason i think its too much is because theres a long time of white (no text) inbetween
[12:22:12] <Eviltwin> Gates: Try making the fadeIn/fadeOut faster
[12:22:17] <Eviltwin> Or try staggering it
[12:23:05] <Gates> yea, im looking for a soft (slow) fade but a fast change
[12:23:11] <Gates> is there a delay option
[12:23:16] <Gates> ..hmm i can just look lol
[12:24:19] <tolborg> Im building my first ever jquery plugin. Im a desperate n00b. Whats the right way to do $('#menu ul ul') if #menu is 'this' ?
[12:24:26] <EClaesson> I have a couple of divs that i want to animate (position) but it does not work. Animating anything else, such as opacity works fine, but left/right/top does nothing. Any idea?
[12:24:46] <Eviltwin> EClaesson: Are you using position: absolute or position: relative?
[12:24:50] <shoky> tolborg: $(this).find('ul ul')
[12:24:50] <tolborg> EClaesson is the divs positioned relative or absolute?
[12:24:55] <tolborg> shoky.. thanks!!
[12:27:14] <pothibo> tolborg: $(this).children("ul > ul") ?
[12:27:38] <pothibo> sry, I blew it. I merge 2 ideas I had
[12:27:56] <pothibo> $(this).children("ul") or $(this).find("ul > ul")
[12:27:59] <Gates> How does this feel?
[12:28:01] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[12:28:01] <tolborg> pothibo: thanks.. how is that different than what shoky wrote? (besides only targeting ul's right beneath an ul) ?
[12:28:15] <Eviltwin> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/Kf7J6/
[12:28:40] <EClaesson^> Eviltwin, tolborg: No the divs are not positioned.
[12:28:54] <Eviltwin> EClaesson^: No, we're not talking about your problem
[12:28:57] <shoky> tolborg: .children would also mean the first ul is right beneath #menu
[12:29:00] <EClaesson^> They are in a div with margin: auto. Could that mess it up?
[12:29:15] <tolborg> shoky okay cool
[12:29:15] <shoky> tolborg: only .find('ul ul') is equivalent to what you originally wrote
[12:29:27] <Eviltwin> EClaesson^: Please read this: http://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_positioning.asp
[12:29:32] <Gates> Eviltwin: yea that feels so much nicer
[12:29:32] <tolborg> so if I wrote #menu > ul ul.. I should use children?
[12:29:41] <Eviltwin> Gates: If you think so
[12:29:54] <shoky> tolborg: yep  ( .find('> ul ul') would also work )
[12:30:07] <tolborg> thanks alot guys.. this is good stuff for me :)
[12:30:07] <shoky> tolborg: err sorry, using children wouldn't work
[12:30:20] <shoky> tolborg: because the nested ul is not a child of #menu
[12:30:29] <Fenikkusu> I've got a jquery plugin I'm writing. The problem is that it has a dependency on another external js file. Is there a recomended way of managing the dependencies so that someone can initalize the plugin properly, even if the parent js hasn't yet loaded. AKA, queue the $("#id").myplugin({option:value}) call?
[12:30:32] <tolborg> shoky ahh ofc
[12:30:40] <jacta> can anyone help me with some rather simple stuff in jquery?
[12:33:08] <pothibo> tolborg: because > will only select children. if you had ul ul ul. they would all be selected.
[12:33:54] <tolborg> pothibo: thanks.. I think I got.. ill stick to find, and use css advanced selectors
[12:33:55] <pothibo> tolborg: sorry just read the last part of your msg. It's faster. It will only scan 1 level deep to match.
[12:34:18] <tolborg> so children is fast than find?
[12:34:51] <pothibo> yeah. It's minimal when you have few elements but it does make a difference when your dom becomes crowded
[12:34:54] <tolborg> even if I do find(> something);
[12:35:13] <tolborg> pothibo: okay.. ill keep that in mind, thanks
[12:35:27] <pothibo> I'm not sure about that. > and children are probably equal
[12:35:49] <pothibo> but it's a bandwith issue. > takes less space as well
[12:35:55] <pothibo> I'd use > when I can
[12:36:10] <tolborg> pothibo: hehe, i will too
[12:40:08] <Gates> Eviltwin: i added a 3rd button, it does a TOTALLY different function can you help to tell me if i did it the best way? http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/45/
[12:40:19] <Gates> and or shoky ^
[12:41:51] <Eviltwin> Gates: What do you think of this? http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/46/
[12:42:13] <Eviltwin> Or this rather: http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/47/
[12:43:21] <Gates> Eviltwin: last question (prob -hehe), if I click department twice or when its already visible, it double blinks, can i disable that?
[12:43:52] <tolborg> omg.. i just found out about scope… I think I <3 jQuery
[12:43:58] <Gates> ^_^
[12:44:20] <Eviltwin> Gates: http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/48/
[12:44:51] <Gates> Eviltwin: why are you so fast at this!?
[12:44:51] <Eviltwin> Oops, http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/49/
[12:44:59] <Eviltwin> Extremely practiced
[12:45:00] <Gates> and i can do an addclass? to have it do a "current link"
[12:45:39] <Gates> Eviltwin: so you can tell which of the 3 you are on and which is default
[12:45:43] <pothibo> Gates: the animation are slow on purpose?

[12:46:43] <GoGoGarrett> https://gist.github.com/e689269b388239bd70d4  <- any idea how to get dynamically added elements to use jquery ui datepicker?
[12:46:54] <Gates> thank you Eviltwin !!!!!!!1
[12:46:56] <GoGoGarrett> line 11-18 should work (from my searching around)
[12:48:04] <Gates> Eviltwin: link me again
[12:48:10] <pothibo> I have a question for you guys. Are the selector cached? if I do $("#myid ul > .someclass") 3 times, will the result be cached the first time ?
[12:48:12] <eclaesson> How can i do something like  $(".class")[n].css('a', 'b') ? To clarify, there are several elements matching .class, and i want a certain (n) of them
[12:48:18] <Gates> to the fund thing
[12:48:44] <Eviltwin> http://pledgie.com/campaigns/16255
[12:49:20] <Eviltwin> eclaesson: see ?eq
[12:49:20] <bot-t> eclaesson, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[12:49:48] <Eviltwin> eclaesson: Or potentially see ?slice if you want more than one
[12:49:48] <bot-t> eclaesson, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[12:57:30] <jedimind> when using index as part of .each how do i determine that it's the last one? can i not check for index == -1 ?
[12:58:42] <Eviltwin> Why would you think you can do that?
[13:02:17] <sp00fz> how can i call css of some id  when link is clicked?
[13:02:36] <Eviltwin> What does it mean to call CSS?
[13:02:56] <Eviltwin> Is it like 1 (800) I-LUV-CSS or something?
[13:03:41] <sp00fz> i want to color red some text when its clicked
[13:03:57] <Eviltwin> $("#id").css("color", "red")
[13:05:18] <ravenzz> jedimind var foo = $('.foo'), count = foo.length; so you can do your check?
[13:08:50] <Eviltwin> $.fn.magiceach = function(cb) { var maxidx = this.length - 1; this.each(function(i, e) { cb.call(this, i, e, i === maxidx); }); };
[13:09:07] <Eviltwin> $(".foo").magiceach(function(i, elem, isLast) { ... });
[13:09:25] <Eviltwin> jedimind: ^
[13:10:42] <ravenzz> + return this;
[13:10:49] <Eviltwin> Yes
[13:11:01] <Eviltwin> Or return this.each(...)
[13:11:18] <Eviltwin> And I suppose return cb.call(...)
[13:11:38] <qom2> how can I check if elements (there are multiple elements with the same class) contains an image, and if so, do something?
[13:11:54] <Eviltwin> YOu mean contains an <img> element?
[13:12:09] <qom2> yeah
[13:12:26] <Eviltwin> if ($("#foo").find("img").length) { ... }
[13:12:34] <Eviltwin> Or if you just want the ones with images
[13:12:43] <Eviltwin> $(".myclass:has(img)")
[13:13:03] <qom2> hm, hold on, I'll paste what I've got
[13:13:33] <tolborg> which is fastest : $('a', nav) or $(nav).find('a') ?
[13:13:35] <qom2> http://pastebin.com/0fYMjCWu – what I want to do is to run line 3 if .contentslider contains an image element
[13:13:40] <Eviltwin> tolborg: The latter
[13:13:46] <Eviltwin> The former runs the latter internally
[13:13:46] <tolborg> Eviltwin: thanks
[13:13:53] <tolborg> ahh ok
[13:14:06] <tolborg> scope is new to me
[13:14:32] <Eviltwin> qom2: if ($(".contentslider img").length) { ... }
[13:14:44] <qom2> but won't that affect all contentsliders?
[13:15:19] <Eviltwin> "what I want to do is to run line 3 if .contentslider contains an image element"
[13:15:28] <Eviltwin> That runs line 3 if a .contentslider contains an image element
[13:15:43] <Eviltwin> If you mean you only want to do that if this particular .contentslider contains an image element
[13:15:47] <Eviltwin> That's a little different
[13:16:13] <Eviltwin> $(".caroufredsel_wrapper, .contentslider:has(img), .contentholder").height(height);
[13:16:22] <Eviltwin> qom2: see ?:has
[13:16:22] <bot-t> qom2, :has(selector): Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[13:17:01] <qom2> ah, that could be it
[13:17:02] <qom2> thanks!
[13:19:20] <qom2> hm, nope, think I need some sort of if there, you see Eviltwin, if contentslider contains an image, caroufredsel_wrapper, contentslider and contentholder should get the height value, but only if that specific contentslider contains an image
[13:19:23] <qom2> here's the url
[13:19:24] <qom2> http://www.danielsachsstiftelse.se/
[13:19:57] <qom2> they are parent and parents parent(?!) to contentslider
[13:24:19] <qom2> any idea Eviltwin?
[13:24:32] <Gates> Eviltwin: i applyed the code to my site and for some reason when I do the #straight_forward it fades away the cols but then pops back up (therefore not staying hidden)
[13:26:02] <Gates> any ideas?
[13:28:55] <Gates> brb
[13:30:05] <radify> qom2: you are setting the height for all elements and only getting when the img is present?
[13:30:22] <qom2> http://pastebin.com/9RdE7ctb
[13:30:28] <Eviltwin> qom2: I have a policy of not going to people's sites
[13:30:33] <qom2> is that much clearer?
[13:30:36] <Eviltwin> qom2: But here's what I think you're aiming for: http://jsfiddle.net/RMpn6/
[13:30:39] <Eviltwin> As a concept
[13:31:01] <qom2> seems about right
[13:31:01] <Eviltwin> The three elements inside each block are changed but only if the middle one has a <span> (colored in blue)
[13:33:01] <radify> qom2: http://pastebin.com/D9LKAy6u
[13:33:27] <Eviltwin> radify: That is not what he wants
[13:34:13] <radify> it is close surely? he may want to set the height element by referring to $(this) instead
[13:35:23] <qom2> both of your solutions aren't working :(
[13:35:26] <qom2> not sure what's up
[13:35:38] <Eviltwin> qom2: Do you have the same structure as I do?
[13:35:47] <Eviltwin> Was my demo doing sort of what you wanted to do?
[13:36:30] <radify> qom2: change this line "$(".caroufredsel_wrapper, .contentslider, .contentholder").height(height);" to $(elem).height(height);
[13:36:40] <radify> in my example
[13:37:44] <qom2> radify: that actually hit the spot
[13:37:53] <joy> I am using my hidden fields id  as item[1], item[2] and so on and I cannot use '#item[1]' as it detects some kinda aarray can somebody help
[13:37:57] <qom2> BUT, if I do a hard refresh in firefox, no images shows up at all
[13:38:01] <qom2> which is a problem
[13:38:34] <Eviltwin> joy: Please read the top of this page: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:39:14] <NoiseEee> joy: also, those are silly IDs, are you *sure* you need them like that?
[13:40:30] <joy> $("input[id^='item["+i+"]']").val('Y');
[13:40:38] <joy> i am using kinda like this
[13:40:52] <joy> and it works but its hard that way
[13:41:09] <NoiseEee> it just has a code-smell, like you're trying to make the ID be more like a NAME attribute for some reason
[13:41:12] <joy> i guess I can tweak the jquery a lil to accept #(item[1])
[13:42:02] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[13:42:08] <Eviltwin> $("#item\[1\]")
[13:42:13] <Eviltwin> Can't read, can you?
[13:42:44] <Eviltwin> $("#item\\[1\\]"), rather
[13:45:32] <joy> ya i think i can live with the escapes
[13:45:51] <mister_m> can I select elements based on partial IDs?
[13:46:14] <Eviltwin> mister_m: Yes but it's not advised
[13:46:22] <mister_m> Eviltwin: how is it done
[13:46:37] <Eviltwin> The id is an attribute so you can use the partial attribute selectors
[13:46:38] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:46:47] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[13:47:12] <mister_m> Eviltwin: thanks. I appreciate that it is not preferable to full ID matching

[13:51:52] <Sallll> Is there any facility in jquery to enable autoscroll?
[13:52:48] <pace_t_zulu> anyone know why documentation for 1.8 isn't on jquery.com ?
[13:54:17] <trollboy> so I've got a form, and if you preselect one of the presets, it sets field values and hides the tr's since you chose the defaults.  I just found out that jquery doesn't submit those on a $('#myform').serialize()  is there a way around this?
[13:54:45] <Eviltwin> What method did you use to hide them?
[14:01:15] <FunnyLookinHat> Is there a way to inject a single value onto a .serialize() that I'm using for $.post() data ?
[14:01:52] <FunnyLookinHat> i.e. I have $.post('/myuri',$('selector').serialize(),callback,'json'); - but I want to add an extra value to the data pulled together in that serialize wihtout having it in an element
[14:03:37] <Eviltwin> +"&foo=bar"?
[14:05:51] <NoiseEee> FunnyLookinHat: screw $.post, use $.ajax and send the value explicitly
[14:06:11] <NoiseEee> imo anyways
[14:06:49] <Eviltwin> Screw $.ajax, use XMLHttpRequest and open teh request yourself
[14:07:40] <Brodingo> Screw XMLHttpRequest, send a notarized letter
[14:08:08] <FunnyLookinHat> ...

[14:08:48] <trollboy> Eviltwin, I use .hide() on the <tr>
[14:10:19] <EyePulp> what's the best way to grab a chunk of plain html from a non-same origin location (s3) and put it on a page via jquery?
[14:10:37] <Eviltwin> ?sop @ EyePulp
[14:10:37] <bot-t> EyePulp, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[14:11:42] <EyePulp> I understand the concept and the restriction.  That's why I'm asking if/how one can accomplish it.  obviously JSONP gets around it in a way, but for executable script
[14:12:13] <EyePulp> do I need to convert the html to a js encoded string?
[14:12:19] <Eviltwin> Probably
[14:12:24] <trollboy> Eviltwin, I used the .hide() method to hide the <tr>'s that contain the inputs
[14:15:20] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/LLcNM/ and http://requestb.in/162seql1?inspect
[14:15:24] <Eviltwin> You must be doing something weird
[14:15:30] <Eviltwin> That involves more than just .hide()
[14:16:14] <ElderFain> If you have something  like 10 text areas and you snag them with a selector like $(".myTextAreaClass") is there a fancy way to say "if all these text areas have text in them, return true" (some usage of "is"?) or would the basic way be to enumerate through the array returned by the selector and just check the text for each field?
[14:16:55] <Eviltwin> ElderFain: That's probably the best way
[14:18:02] <ElderFain> okay so no fancy selector like :visible
[14:18:03] <lynaghk> Is there anything special I need to do to use jQuery UI sortables in a browser popup window (i.e., not a jQuery modal, but actual document.open() popup)? It seems like absolute positioning is getting all confused in the child popup.
[14:18:05] <ElderFain> to check for text precense
[14:18:08] <ElderFain> presence
[14:20:00] <Eviltwin> ElderFain: You could see ?:parent and see ?:empty
[14:20:01] <bot-t> ElderFain, :parent: Select all elements that are the parent of another element, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/parent-selector/
[14:20:01] <bot-t> ElderFain, :empty: Select all elements that have no children (including text nodes). http://api.jquery.com/empty-selector/
[14:20:05] <radify> lynaghk: common cause of absolute positioning messing up in a child elem is the parent position (it must be set to relative)
[14:20:14] <Eviltwin> Those might work
[14:20:41] <lynaghk> radify: no luck. I suspect something internal to the jQuery UI plugin is referencing the parent's document rather than the popup window's document.
[14:22:13] <jd2> how can i have a div say loading while I wait for a get method to finish and then append to the div?

[14:23:24] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:23:30] <agu10^> I need to emulate the user clicking on a dropdown menu
[14:23:33] <Eviltwin> ?load @ jd2
[14:23:33] <bot-t> jd2, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[14:23:42] <agu10^> http://potentialstudio.com.ar/index.php
[14:23:46] <Eviltwin> agu10^: You mean to open it for them?
[14:23:54] <agu10^> on the top, the dropdown, when you click on a different option
[14:23:57] <Navyman> I have a slide, and I have a function afterSlideChange: function(){}. I would like to make a text highlightinh according the current slide and doing a while. How that?
[14:24:00] <agu10^> google translate will translate the website
[14:24:12] <agu10^> i need to emulate the clicking so that it translates without clicking
[14:24:20] <agu10^> Eviltwin, no.
[14:24:21] <Navyman> I have 4 slides, and I want to highlight 4 texts.
[14:24:30] <agu10^> Eviltwin, to choose an option.
[14:24:31] <jd2> does .text empty the contents first?
[14:24:39] <Eviltwin> jd2: Yes
[14:24:41] <jd2> Eviltwin thanks for your help!
[14:24:54] <agu10^> var selector = $(".skiptranslate").children().children().get(0);var option = $(selector).children().get(1);$(option).attr("selected", "selected").click(); this is my code
[14:25:09] <agu10^> this does not work because it doesn't fully emulate it. the page does not get translated.
[14:25:11] <Navyman> Eviltwin, did you read my question ?
[14:25:38] <Eviltwin> ?cik @ Navyman
[14:25:38] <bot-t> Navyman, Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[14:26:06] <Navyman> Eviltwin: I don't have any code and I don't know how to code that ^^
[14:26:37] <Eviltwin> Well I don't understand what you mean by that
[14:26:42] <agu10^> Navyman, you should try talking in your native language
[14:26:46] <agu10^> to people who understand it
[14:26:53] <Eviltwin> Who most likely aren't here in the first place
[14:27:23] <Navyman> Okay, I will try to explain the situation. I use ORBIT slideshow (http://www.zurb.com/playground/orbit-jquery-image-slider)
[14:27:46] <Eviltwin> Well that would have been a useful piece of information
[14:27:50] <agu10^> what language do you speak?
[14:28:17] <Navyman> And I would like when a slide change to highlight a span text (with CSS for exemple)
[14:28:23] <Navyman> I speak French
[14:28:29] <agu10^> ah
[14:28:45] <agu10^> french always having issues with english
[14:28:56] <Navyman> rofl :)
[14:28:59] <Navyman> I don't speak well ^^?
[14:29:06] <agu10^> not well enough
[14:29:26] <agu10^> ugh
[14:29:38] <agu10^> you must have an event
[14:29:41] <Navyman> agu10^: you think you can help me ?
[14:29:43] <agu10^> in that library.
[14:29:44] <ElderFain> Eviltwin: that worked great, $(".selector:empty").length > 0
[14:29:56] <agu10^> if you can find that event and call a function
[14:30:06] <Navyman> agu10^: i have no experience in javascript, i can pay for that issue
[14:30:14] <agu10^> ahh
[14:30:17] <Navyman> agu10^: it's urgent: i can pay you via paypal
[14:30:27] <agu10^> no thanks
[14:30:32] <Navyman> agu10^: i prefer speaking about this simple issue in private
[14:30:43] <Navyman> agu10^: then I can show you an exemple on production server ^^
[14:30:56] <agu10^> maybe somebody here is interested
[14:31:17] <Navyman> agu10^: i know what I want to do is really simple, but I don't know how.
[14:31:30] <Navyman> agu10^: but for an expert it will take maximum 5 minute
[14:31:34] <agu10^> you could ask in #html5 or #javascript
[14:31:37] <agu10^> I'm no expert.
[14:32:02] <Eviltwin> Navyman: The "active" or current slide will have the class "active"
[14:32:23] <Eviltwin> In afterSlideChange do $("#myslideshow .active").index()
[14:32:32] <Eviltwin> And that number will represent which slide is being shown
[14:32:35] <Navyman> ok, i will try
[14:33:13] <Navyman> afterSlideChange: function(){
[14:33:13] <Navyman> 			$("#featured .active").index();
[14:33:13] <Navyman> 		}
[14:33:19] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[14:33:22] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ Navyman
[14:33:22] <bot-t> Navyman, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:33:29] <agu10^> I'd like to work but I have to study
[14:33:30] <agu10^> lol
[14:33:49] <Navyman> Yes I know :)
[14:33:57] <Navyman> I should read, but I have no time right now ^^
[14:34:05] <Navyman> that's why I would like to pay someone for that
[14:34:16] <Eviltwin> Well $("#featured .active").index() will give you the number of the slide being shown
[14:34:23] <Eviltwin> Then you have to do something with that number
[14:34:30] <Navyman> I have no number show
[14:35:28] <jd2> Eviltwin .load clears the selector?
[14:35:44] <Navyman> i did alert to see the number, but -1 is returned
[14:36:06] <Navyman> on all slides
[14:36:27] <Eviltwin> Oh, the class is actually on the bullets
[14:36:32] <Eviltwin> So you need to turn those on
[14:36:39] <Eviltwin> You can make them invisible
[14:36:58] <Eviltwin> But I don't see any other way to do this without modifying the code of the plugin
[14:37:39] <jd2> .append().load('url') would that not clear it?
[14:38:08] <agu10^_> i hate html5 + javascript for development
[14:38:11] <Eviltwin> jd2: Lots of people spent lots of time making this website: api.jquerty.com
[14:38:13] <Eviltwin> jd2: Use it
[14:38:18] <Eviltwin> api.jquery.com*
[14:38:22] <agu10^_> :( ... where is my statically typed language and framework? :(
[14:38:44] <silverwind> Not invented yet...
[14:38:49] <agu10^_> javascript is so dirty
[14:40:20] <tw2113> in a good or bad way?
[14:41:04] <agu10^_> bad
[14:41:11] <agu10^_> verrry bad
[14:41:31] <Navyman> Any pro to help me for 10$ instant payment for a really simple help ? Private message, thanks
[14:42:04] <agu10^_> US$ 100 ?
[14:43:23] <ElderFain> https://gist.github.com/aa1a65ec1f5f85295f4d  whenever I first load the page and click the button, if all text areas have text, the console.log shows []. if I delete all the text from the text areas, console.log still shows []. reload the page and have the same state reload (text missing from a text area) and the console.log shows text areas
[14:43:26] <Navyman> $US 10
[14:43:28] <ElderFain> why isn't it updating between clicks?
[14:43:32] <Navyman> That a simple problem :)
[14:44:15] <ElderFain> basically on page load it only ever takes the if, or the else, but it never swaps between after the first click
[14:44:58] <jrockjiggz> ElderFain: https://gist.github.com/3541979
[14:45:51] <ElderFain> i don't get why the closure is making it not re-execute?
[14:46:22] <qom2> http://www.danielsachsstiftelse.se/ – If you drag the window height to be longer/shorter, you'll notice that the images resizes. What I'm wondering now is, how can I implement a stop so that the image won't get any wider than the window width?
[14:47:28] <jrockjiggz> qom2: css max-width:
[14:47:37] <jrockjiggz> or min-width
[14:48:06] <qom2> but, the height is defined via javascript, so if I set a max-width it'll distort the image
[14:49:05] <ElderFain> jrockjiggz: i removed the $(function) and also wrapped it around, same behavior still happens
[14:50:32] <ElderFain>       console.log($(".requiredTextArea:empty").length); always returns what it did on the first time you did the click
[14:50:40] <ElderFain> regardless of if thats still the case
[15:07:29] <tolborg> how do I write " left: '-=220' " if 220 is a variable?
[15:08:03] <rmurphey> tolborg: left: '-=' + varname
[15:08:12] <rmurphey> just like you'd create any other string
[15:08:27] <tolborg> rmurphey: yeah I can see that.. weird why I didnt try. Thanks though :)
[15:15:21] <Sven_Oostenbrink> I have a mobile site using jquery and jquery mobile. When somebody clicks a button "menu", I insert / remove a <ul> list in the data-role="page" part so that it displays the menu right above the page. Problem now is that if somebody clicks a link in the menu, it slides nicely to the next page, and then jQuery seems no longer to respond to the click on the menu button.. Any suggestions?
[15:21:38] <Nami-Doc> Sven_Oostenbrink: use .on 'click' (or .live)
[15:21:49] <Nami-Doc> because .click only assigns to current list of elements.
[15:22:25] <Nami-Doc> $('#menu').on('click', 'a', function () { ... })
[15:32:08] <Sven_Oostenbrink> Nami-Doc: I am actually already using $('#controlcontainer').on('mousedown', '#menubutton', ....... where #controlcontainer is the parent of the menu button, and #menubutton is the button itself..
[15:33:16] <Sven_Oostenbrink> And Im using mousedown there instead of click because it works a bit directer, but that should not be the problem.. If I use "click", I have the same problem
[15:34:13] <Zzaichik> directer is a cool word choice
[15:34:52] <blendedbychris> hey guys I have an interesting dilema i've never faced. I have a spinner here that I'd like to have the user be able to "click" the words or drag the needle to the word choice…
[15:34:55] <blendedbychris> http://imnotblankenough.com/imag
[15:35:12] <blendedbychris> I already have something that just spins it, i'm okay with just using deg() css3
[15:35:19] <blendedbychris> just curious how I get the coords
[15:36:05] <Sven_Oostenbrink> Zzaichik: Directer... That sometimes happens, english is not my first language, and in dutch "direkter" is actually a valid word :) My bad
[15:36:59] <Zzaichik> haha - it's all good, Sven_Oostenbrink - I thought it was cool.. got the point across. :)
[15:37:26] <jamesdotnet> Sven_Oostenbrink: Can you cut it down to a test case and see if the behavior is the same?
[15:38:21] <Sven_Oostenbrink> jamesdotnet: Already on that, cutting out all the non-relevant parts.. I was just hoping that somebody might know something to avoid spending half a day on this weird bug.. :)
[15:39:32] <Sven_Oostenbrink> Zzaichik: Im actually in Mexico.. So I talk dutch, english and spanish.. Together with a dutch friend of mine who speaks the same languages, and we tend to speak all languages mixed in one phrase, whatever word is easiest to explain the situation :) Languages are fun!
[15:40:16] <jamesdotnet> I can speak Spanglish but not Spanglutch :)
[15:40:51] <totimkopf> jamesdotnet, tengo que codear, pero antes tengo que parquear mi trucke
[15:41:03] <totimkopf> trucka*
[15:41:13] <Sven_Oostenbrink> lol :) Something like that yes
[15:41:18] <Zzaichik> hahah
[15:41:34] <totimkopf> y depues de ahi, vamos a watchear la tv, orale
[15:41:36] <jamesdotnet> lol
[15:41:44] <Sven_Oostenbrink> Its more like, Tengo que develop this systeem dat gewoon werkt!
[15:42:26] <totimkopf> spanglutch
[15:42:26] <totimkopf> wow
[15:42:33] <totimkopf> geel grappig hoor
[15:42:41] <totimkopf> geel chistoso oye
[15:43:22] <totimkopf> my favorite part of Dutch is 'hoor'
[15:43:29] <Sven_Oostenbrink> I have to remember that word, next time somebody asks me what the heck I am babbling about..
[15:43:37] <Sven_Oostenbrink> Nee hoor! :D
[15:43:50] <totimkopf> ik hoor je niet hoor
[15:44:57] <Sven_Oostenbrink> I take it you're German?
[15:45:41] <Sven_Oostenbrink> Who ever invented it that the language "Nederlands" should be called "Dutch" which basically is "Deutsch", which means German.. Confused the hell out of me when I was a kid..
[15:46:59] <Crshman> when using .ajax, what is considered a success? any HTTP 2xx code or only a 200?
[15:47:03] <totimkopf> Sven_Oostenbrink nobody invented it, just idiots confused them for germans
[15:47:34] <johnkpaul> Crshman: any 2xx
[15:48:44] <Crshman> sweeet thanks johnkpaul
[15:48:55] <Covered> ja hoor
[15:49:06] <totimkopf> hoor
[15:49:08] <Covered> hva bent jullie aan te doen hoor
[15:49:18] <totimkopf> hva = norsk hoor
[15:49:41] <totimkopf> Sven_Oostenbrink, Covered likes to hoor too
[15:49:41] <Od1n> hi
[15:49:41] <Covered> *wat
[15:50:08] <Od1n> there's a typo in the 1.8.1 release blog post
[15:50:19] <Od1n> anyone here able to edit it?
[15:50:19] <totimkopf> I just make a jquery plugin and name it hoor.js
[15:50:29] <totimkopf> but I have no idea what it'd do
[15:50:36] <totimkopf> s/just/should
[15:52:15] <Sven_Oostenbrink> Adds 5 !!!! behind every string on a page? :)
[15:52:25] <Blaster> hey guys how come $(this) changes when inside a callback function and how can I use the $(this) from the parent event handler?

[15:54:44] <Blaster> Eviltwin:  Thanks, I'm not quite sure how to work that into my case though.  Do I need to create a proxy with the element I want to store and then call that within my anonymous function?
[15:55:08] <Od1n> nobody?
[15:55:11] <blendedbychris> indeed

[16:09:27] <EyePulp> anyone recommend a lightweight dragging plugin that works under 1.6.4?  I can't use JqUI  =(
[16:11:43] <gnarf> EyePulp: can you recommend a method of travel from NY to Europe, I can't use a plane
[16:12:09] <EyePulp> gnarl - I recommend llamas.  at least two.
[16:12:18] <EyePulp> s/gnarl/gnarf
[16:12:22] <gnarf> ui.draggable is pretty straightforward and has a minimal dependency
[16:12:41] <EyePulp> it depends on adding jqui to the project.
[16:12:54] <gnarf> only ui.core, ui.mouse, ui.draggable
[16:13:07] <gnarf> all 3 are pretty tiny
[16:13:18] <gnarf> you don't even need the css
[16:15:38] <EyePulp> understood.  I'll take that recommendation under consideration.  I'm looking at all options.
[16:18:30] <gnarf> EyePulp: honestly, its not terribly hard to write your own little mini draggable
[16:18:39] <gnarf> but there are a lot of strange edge cases
[16:19:23] <k1ng_> 
[16:19:45] <EyePulp> gnarl - yeah - the client is pretty limited in what they've accepted into their "usable" scripting library.  However…  I think I'm getting some UI love back on some test queries.  this may be a moot discussion =)
[16:19:48] <gnarf> you just need a mousedown event to bind a global mousemove/mouseup event and unbind both on the mouseup... in the mousemove, calculate difference from the mousedown and apply change to the .css() of the element
[16:20:06] <EyePulp> gnarf - sorry, keep mis-spelling your nick
[16:20:25] <gnarf> whatever, apparently its a common typo, cuz you're not the only one who calls me gnarl ;)
[16:21:25] <gnarf> Od1n: typo?
[16:21:55] <gnarf> Od1n: also, check #jquery-dev next time you have a report like that - less noise, more team members
[16:26:50] <Od1n> gnarf, sent you by pm
[16:30:38] <EyePulp> thanks gnarf - looks like I can use ui - woot
[16:31:17] <EyePulp> also, "gnarl" is the autocorrected version of "gnarf" under osx/colloquy.  Thanks autocorrect!

[16:33:47] <gnarf> there we go
[16:59:35] <ElderFain> Can anyone suggest why when I bind a function to a click, the function never seems to re-evaluate the selector within it? https://gist.github.com/aa1a65ec1f5f85295f4d $(".requiredTextArea:empty") length is frozen to whatever the value is when the button is pressed. if you make a requiredTextArea not empty, the button still runs the "empty" logic. if you reload the page and make the fields not
[16:59:35] <ElderFain>  empty, the button runs the not empty logic, but never updates the other way to 'empty'
[17:01:26] <johnkpaul> ElderFain: I think you're looking for .val().length
[17:01:40] <johnkpaul> ?val @ ElderFain
[17:01:40] <bot-t> ElderFain, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[17:03:03] <ElderFain> the selector returns an array of DOM elements
[17:03:05] <ElderFain> or an empty array
[17:03:20] <ElderFain> calling .val() on it in one of those states is an assert in JS
[17:05:37] <amccloud> Does jQuery support visibilitychange event?
[17:06:08] <ElderFain> I've modified the gist to include the DOM
[17:06:09] <ElderFain> https://gist.github.com/aa1a65ec1f5f85295f4d
[17:06:49] <ElderFain> if we call $('.requiredTextArea:empty') it will return an array with one object, the last text area
[17:07:03] <ElderFain> if i populate that text area with text, then call the same method again, it returns an array with 1 object still
[17:07:18] <b-lew> http://www.omahacareercoach.com/index.php -> weird js error. i'm not for sure how to fix it.
[17:07:18] <b-lew> page_controls_menu_js
[17:07:25] <b-lew> I think something isn't linking up right in the js
[17:07:33] <b-lew> but I'm having a terrible time fixing it
[17:08:27] <mfoxdogg|work> mornign all
[17:09:45] <johnkpaul> ElderFain: yes, adding text doesn't increase the amount of objects that match that selector
[17:09:55] <johnkpaul> it just changes the value in the DOM element that matches that selector
[17:10:57] <ElderFain> okay, so lets back up. I was trying to use a button.click where if ($('.class:empty').length >0) would tell me if a text area had text or not in it
[17:11:09] <ElderFain> but you just said that isn't what i want
[17:11:23] <ElderFain> even thought it sort of works, but only once. (ha, which makes it worthless for this case)
[17:11:30] <defaultro> anyone here in Chicago and really good in JQuery?
[17:11:39] <johnkpaul> oh sorry, I see what you were trying to do ElderFain
[17:12:18] <johnkpaul> ElderFain:  why are you wrapping your handler in $()?
[17:12:36] <ElderFain> oh is that still there? i've removed it from the code
[17:12:40] <ElderFain> it shouldn't matter either way
[17:12:50] <ElderFain> johnkpaul: everyone loves closures?
[17:13:07] <defaultro> what func can I use to convert array to string?
[17:13:11] <johnkpaul> I don't think that :empty does what you think ElderFain
[17:13:13] <johnkpaul> ?:empty
[17:13:13] <bot-t> :empty: Select all elements that have no children (including text nodes). http://api.jquery.com/empty-selector/
[17:13:23] <defaultro> join should be good right
[17:13:30] <ElderFain> defaultro: join
[17:13:35] <johnkpaul> :empty is not the same as .val() = "'
[17:13:37] <defaultro> yup
[17:13:39] <johnkpaul> ^ @ ElderFain
[17:13:55] <ElderFain> johnkpaul: okay
[17:13:59] <ElderFain> so there isn't a simple selector i can do
[17:14:58] <ElderFain> if($('.requiredTextArea').each(function(idx,obj){ if (obj.val()=="") return false}))
[17:14:58] <ElderFain> ?
[17:15:05] <johnkpaul> ?filter @ElderFain
[17:15:06] <bot-t> ElderFain, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[17:15:11] <defaultro> wow, join is intelligent :D
[17:15:32] <defaultro> did make the string I expected since it's multidim array
[17:16:14] <ElderFain> johnkpaul: that just told me $('.requiredTextArea').filter(':empty') =0
[17:16:19] <ElderFain> don't think thats what you intended
[17:16:23] <ElderFain> lets see the function
[17:16:30] <ElderFain> yeah tere we go
[17:16:35] <johnkpaul> ElderFain: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1299424/selecting-empty-text-input-using-jquery
[17:16:43] <johnkpaul> the first answer uses filter
[17:16:49] <defaultro> if you guys are in Chicago and looking for a new job, I really have some good news. Of course, interview still needs to happen
[17:16:56] <ElderFain> aww man, seriously, this was on SO???
[17:17:00] <ElderFain> damnit my google-fu SUCKS
[17:17:02] <ElderFain> how did i miss that =(
[17:17:34] <johnkpaul> eh,don't worry about it, practice makes perfect :)
[17:17:41] <zduffy> So I have a long string of text I want displayed that is styled. i have to used before to insert a line break and after to display the rest of the text with style attached to it. Now every time the change function is called html only get displayed once, but before and after keep rendering. Why? http://pastebin.com/Tgv9XBfn
[17:18:42] <zduffy> Its like before and after do not get unbind and bind again
[17:22:54] <ElderFain> if ($(".requiredTextArea").filter(function() { return $(this).val() =="";}).length > 0)
[17:22:57] <ElderFain> wee
[17:22:59] <ElderFain> workie
[17:23:08] <johnkpaul> :) great!
[17:23:13] * ElderFain ships it
[17:23:15] <ElderFain> ship it!
[17:23:32] <ElderFain> to be fair, i played with jquery validator for 2 hours yesterday
[17:23:44] <ElderFain> so it would be "easy" $('myform').validate
[17:24:09] <ElderFain> but man I could not get anything to go with that. so i went for just display the normal confirmation dialog, or display an error dialog "go fill yo shit out" otherwise
[17:24:09] <ElderFain> meh
[17:30:54] <ElderFain> johnkpaul: thanks. I don't have as much time as I'd like to do javascript. =)
[17:31:25] <johnkpaul> no problem, it does always take some learning
[17:50:27] <Afflicto> Hey all -- I have an interval that runs a function, I need the mouse X position every interval. I see that .click(events) will let you use event.pageX. But this doesn't work on intervals.
[17:56:04] <postoy> hola, do you need to retrieve by any other event? if not, what's the interval set at?
[18:03:31] <postoy> lol. Wil Wheaton.
[18:04:48] <zduffy> how can you stop .after and .before from rendering more than once?
[18:05:34] <postoy> @zduffy: in a loop?
[18:05:50] <zduffy> postoy: http://pastebin.com/Tgv9XBfn
[18:06:14] <zduffy> every change function displays after and before each time the function fires
[18:06:38] <postoy> thanks for the context (pastebin).
[18:07:04] <monstordh> is there a way to determine if a person has closed a window and reopened the same link?
[18:07:23] <monstordh> i've been asked to set a cookie that lives until they close the page
[18:07:29] <monstordh> sorry - window
[18:08:22] <postoy> @monstordh, i'm almost certain you'll have to use cookies.
[18:08:40] <zduffy> monstordh: Use session?
[18:08:55] <monstordh> postoy: i'm a cookie newbie. i've got a script that sets the cookie and i can give it a ttl
[18:09:05] <monstordh> zduffy: tell me more about session
[18:09:11] <monstordh> is that a jquery function?
[18:09:34] <postoy> if you're doing sessions, you should probably do it server side.
[18:10:21] <samholmes> Is there a :data attibute selector
[18:10:23] <zduffy> monstordh: no. are you using php?
[18:10:31] <samholmes> or do I just do [data-something=something]?
[18:10:45] <postoy> monstordh: try this plug-in… https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[18:10:52] <monstordh> zduffy: i'm using Drupal, but setting my cookie with jQuery plugin
[18:11:01] <monstordh> postoy: that's what i'm using
[18:11:14] <monstordh> just don't know anything about session
[18:11:25] <zduffy> I would ditch that and use php session
[18:11:39] <monstordh> zduffy: why?
[18:11:40] <defaultro> hey folks, is it possible to tell where an object is coming from? like from which .js file via firebug?
[18:11:41] <postoy> if you're doing a session, you need to set it with a server-side script.
[18:11:49] <zduffy> But since your using drupal you will probably have to use it
[18:12:01] <postoy> Ah, set your session with PHP.
[18:12:06] <monstordh> zduffy: use php to set?
[18:12:14] <postoy> monstordh: yes.
[18:12:25] <zduffy> monstordh: http://drupal.org/node/360542
[18:12:52] <monstordh> how do i get that to play with my jquery cookie? can i still interact with it?
[18:13:12] <postoy> zduffy: you can set a cookie in PHP and it can be read by jQuery.
[18:13:26] <postoy> sorry, that was for monster. ;)
[18:13:33] <zduffy> ;)
[18:13:34] <monstordh> zduffy, postoy - I mispoke. this is NOT a Drupal site. my bad
[18:13:45] <monstordh> I have been working on too many different sites today
[18:13:52] <zduffy> Custom?
[18:13:54] <monstordh> and it's not php. it's asp
[18:14:07] <postoy> fair enough. just set a session in asp.
[18:14:11] <postoy> and a cookie.
[18:14:18] <postoy> retrieve the cookie in jQuery.
[18:14:23] <postoy> using the plug-in that you've found.
[18:14:38] <zduffy> monstordh: http://www.w3schools.com/asp/asp_sessions.asp
[18:14:50] <postoy> please don't use w3schools.
[18:15:03] <monstordh> so a cookie is a cookie. doesn't matter what created it, correct?
[18:15:12] <postoy> correct.
[18:17:33] <monstordh> Thanks, guys. This looks like what I need. I appreciate your help!
[18:17:48] <zduffy> postoy was more help than I was ;)
[18:17:53] <postoy> lol.
[18:18:11] <postoy> This if fun. I haven't been in this room before. Glad I could be of help.
[18:18:23] <zduffy> postoy, do I need to unload my function? or what should I do
[18:18:25] <postoy> is*
[18:18:32] <postoy> Let me check, sorry.
[18:18:43] <zduffy> Your good. Glad we could help someone else before me
[18:19:03] <postoy> si, it was a easier question.
[18:19:50] <postoy> .change can be troublesome on selects if I remember correctly.
[18:20:22] <postoy> one sec, un momento.
[18:21:31] <postoy> monstordh: are you still there?
[18:21:35] <postoy> I have a recommendation.
[18:21:37] <monstordh> yes
[18:21:40] <monstordh> hit me
[18:21:44] <postoy> You don't need cookies.
[18:22:07] <postoy> I had a thought while I was pouring a drink. lol
[18:22:29] <postoy> If you're doing a session, all you need to do is append a class.
[18:22:44] <postoy> This way, if cookies are disabled, you are still able to run JS.
[18:23:08] <postoy> You won't need to use cookies or a plug-in.
[18:23:26] <postoy> make sense?
[18:23:42] <zduffy> I didn't think using that plug-in was a good idea ;)
[18:23:53] <monstordh> postoy: no - not following you
[18:24:11] <postoy> so say, if there is a session active, append a class to html or body tag.
[18:24:29] <postoy> make sense now?
[18:25:08] <monstordh> hm… here's what i'm trying to do. i need a DIV to drop down for a new session and not open again during the same session, no matter how many pages they navigate through
[18:25:32] <postoy> you'll be creating a session in ASP.
[18:26:02] <zduffy> When they close the window and go back in it will display the div if you use strictly session
[18:26:17] <postoy> just check if there is a session, and if there is, append a class (e.g. session-active) to the html or body tag and do your thing with jQuery.
[18:26:45] <monstordh> when would i remove it?
[18:27:09] <postoy> When would the session end?
[18:27:26] <monstordh> because if they are still in the same session, won't the class always be present? if so, the jQuery action will repeat for every page load
[18:27:42] <monstordh> i only want it to happen at the beginning of each session
[18:28:14] <monstordh> don't i need to run my jQuery FIRST, and then set my session?
[18:28:19] <monstordh> somehow
[18:29:11] <postoy> No, your session will run first. It'll be above your doctype.
[18:30:07] <postoy> I recommend learning the basics of a server-side language.
[18:30:19] <postoy> Not now, but in the future. It will help you tremendously.
[18:30:25] <monstordh> postoy: i would love to, but this is due tonight :)
[18:30:30] <postoy> Sure.
[18:30:39] <zduffy> monstordh: are you using asp.net?
[18:30:40] <postoy> Your session is set before anything else.
[18:30:50] <zduffy> in every language..
[18:30:56] <postoy> I think that's the rule.
[18:31:00] <monstordh> zduffy: i'm using the client's installation of Magento
[18:31:12] <postoy> Magento is written in PHP.
[18:31:15] <zduffy> I just prefer php, I "dislike" microsoft? lol
[18:31:17] <postoy> Are you sure you're using ASP?
[18:31:36] <zduffy> monstordh: post up some code for us to see at pastebin.org
[18:31:45] <monstordh> zduffy: crud buckets. i'm really confused now. let me check. I KNOW it's ASP. I may be thinking of another cart they use. hangon
[18:32:01] <postoy> It's going to be PHP, monstordh. ;)
[18:32:11] <zduffy> in that case its easy? forget asp :)
[18:32:12] <postoy> You're running PHP on IIS.
[18:32:24] <monstordh> LOL - if there's anything I'm certain of, it's that it's ASP
[18:32:29] <monstordh> home.asp
[18:32:40] <postoy> what? with Magento? That's news to me.
[18:32:53] <postoy> Is it using wrapper or something?
[18:33:27] <postoy> Magento is written in PHP.
[18:33:30] <monstordh> PRODUCTCART
[18:33:37] <monstordh> wow… that was painful
[18:33:50] <monstordh> postoy: Right. They have a Magento store I work with as well
[18:35:41] <zduffy> I hate mixing two languages? if it really is using asp and php
[18:35:51] <postoy> Magento is written in PHP.
[18:35:56] <postoy> Stick with it.
[18:36:07] <postoy> You have PHP installed on IIS.
[18:36:09] <zduffy> i don't know why it keeps putting ? when i don't type that lol
[18:39:20] <monstordh> all i need to do is figure out a way to allow an action to happen at the beginning of a session. is there any way jQuery can determine that?
[18:43:29] <ngharo> if(session && !alldone) { do something; set cookie:all done }
[18:46:36] <ngharo> or server land print print out session_start = true; in javascript
[18:46:40] <ngharo> and check that
[18:56:45] <zduffy> When using the html method on a div that is styled, why can't you insert a line break? it breaks up the border line for instance
[18:57:28] <zduffy> If I have a large string of text, and want to line break it, it messes the style up
[19:01:44] <ngharo> ?demo
[19:01:44] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:02:56] <Gabriel__> anyone using miniadmin version 3.0 with jquery ?
[19:03:00] <BillCriswell> zduffy: \n or <br>?
[19:03:07] <zduffy> <br>
[19:06:31] <BillCriswell> I'm having a hard time following. Definitely set up an example.
[19:06:35] <zduffy> http://jsfiddle.net/fjnKB/
[19:07:20] <zduffy> As you can see, after the line break it messes up the styling
[19:08:19] <zduffy> Also if you select another and then ok it keeps putting in the first line break multiple times
[19:08:27] <Gabriel__> I have a back-end setup using maniadmin and jquery, I designed a component that has many tabbed containers and a different form in each and every one, can anyone suggest a solution for when any of the form is submitted to load the page with the tab where the submitted form was expanded? It always goes back to the first tab.
[19:13:06] <BillCriswell> zduffy: That would happen without jQuery.
[19:14:49] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/ypXDg/
[19:16:15] <BillCriswell> zduffy: It's just how inline elements work.
[19:20:23] <zduffy> BillCriswell: any suggestions?
[19:21:46] <ngharo> you can use inline-block
[19:21:55] <ngharo> or just a block element like div
[19:22:01] <ngharo> display: inline-block*
[19:23:29] <BillCriswell> zduffy: http://jsfiddle.net/fjnKB/2/ for example.
[19:25:21] <zduffy> Ok good idea. Another idea i had washttp://jsfiddle.net/fjnKB/1/
[19:25:30] <zduffy> http://jsfiddle.net/fjnKB/1/
[19:25:58] <BillCriswell> zduffy: This is pretty overcomplicated.
[19:26:05] <zduffy> Yeah haha
[19:28:17] <Gabriel__> anyone experienced in performing form submitions using forms inside tabs know how to retain the current tab after a form is submitted?
[19:29:00] <BillCriswell> zduffy: Instead of the .before() br just use margin. That'll keep it form pushing down.
[19:29:33] <zduffy> BillCriswell: I had it that way before but wanted to try a line break. Thank you for your help
[19:29:38] <amccloud> Why does this selector not work as expected? a:not([rel="external"]) - http://jsfiddle.net/zZpyV/
[19:31:25] <BillCriswell> amccloud: Works right if I do it like this.. http://jsfiddle.net/zZpyV/1/ not sure why your way doesn't though.
[19:31:51] <amccloud> BillCriswell: I guess cause that way isn't delegating
[19:32:16] <amccloud> But it doesn't account for new links being added to the page.
[19:34:54] <BillCriswell> amccloud: http://jsfiddle.net/zZpyV/2/ perhaps?
[19:35:22] <amccloud> BillCriswell: Sweet!
[19:35:29] <BillCriswell> I forgot about the delegation part. :(
[19:35:33] <amccloud> now that i think about it, wtf was I doing
[19:35:43] <amccloud> this is what I meant to type from the get go
[19:35:45] <BillCriswell> amccloud: I'm never even sure what I'm doing.
[19:36:03] <BillCriswell> amccloud: The brain is a weird thing sometimes.
[19:36:31] <amccloud> Thanks :)
[19:36:41] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[20:18:53] <oojacoboo> how would I go about solving an anonymouse function error in Chrome console?
[20:19:14] <oojacoboo> for some reason it's only thrown when running it through our minifier
[20:19:49] <oojacoboo> is that b/c the anonymous functions are having some sort of collisions after the minification?
[20:49:08] <Afflicto> Hey all - I'm working on a wysiwyg html editor. When I go to the source view, I need to copy the html content of the editable div. which works fine, but it grabs a whole bunch of whitespace. any way to remove whitespace? I'd like to keep newlines though.

[21:09:10] <AshyAtWork> hi
[21:09:41] <AshyAtWork> ive got a question about this syntax: $('blahblah', this)
[21:09:44] <AshyAtWork> what exactly is that d oing?
[21:10:02] <AshyAtWork> i'm loking at the example here: http://jsfiddle.net/MV62K/2/
[21:26:54] <LoneStar99> howdy
[21:28:32] <LoneStar99> how would I do a $('ui').text(); ?? <ui id="foo">blah</ui> ?
[21:30:49] <totimkopf> yo guys
[21:32:19] <jamesaa> Any idea how I can refresh data without actually refreshing the page after an ajax insert
[21:32:34] <LoneStar99> capture the text from ui id="foo"??
[21:34:47] <totimkopf> I'm going to setup a fiddle, but the gist of my problem is, I am using ajax to check if something already exists inside a .submit event handler, it works, but the only problem is I have to click the submit *again* for it to submit
[21:36:36] <totimkopf> in other words I don't think the $('#formid').submit(); inside the .submit handler is actually being invoked for some reason
[21:36:46] <LoneStar99> sorry <ul id="foo">blah</ul>
[21:38:15] <LoneStar99> totimkopf: try using this $(document).on('click', '#e', function(event){ ... });
[21:50:28] <amccloud> does anyone know of a lightweight version of something like this? http://razorjack.net/quicksand/index.html
[21:50:40] <amccloud> basically i just need to animate a list item to a new position
[21:51:25] <LoneStar99> pretty cool
[21:52:15] <LoneStar99> amccloud: you know how to capture text from a <ul id="foo">blah<ul> ??
[21:52:32] <berglar> heyo, I'm having difficulty getting .height() to be useful
[21:52:59] <amccloud> $('#foo').text();
[21:53:18] <berglar> I'm within a .each loop but when I do $(this).height() I get undefined
[21:53:22] <amccloud> or .html();
[21:53:38] <berglar> is there a way to call .height() on something that's not an element id?
[21:53:47] <amccloud> berglar: paste your code
[21:54:11] <LoneStar99> amccloud: k
[21:54:13] <LoneStar99> thanks
[21:54:40] <berglar> http://dpaste.com/794028/
[21:55:42] <berglar> the html is like this
[21:55:43] <berglar> http://dpaste.com/794029/
[21:56:12] <berglar> i just want to iterate through the outline and get the height of all the .outlineTitle and .outlineRest objects
[21:56:19] <berglar> thanks in advance
[22:04:47] <amccloud> berglar: I don't see #outline
[22:04:50] <amccloud> in your markup
[22:04:59] <amccloud> just #outline_1
[22:05:58] <rgr> whats the correct/best style  way to only append an element of a certain class if there doesnt aleady exist a child of that class?
[22:06:08] <amccloud> berglar: is your end goal to just get the height of outlineBox?
[22:06:25] <berglar> here you are
[22:06:26] <berglar> http://dpaste.com/794033/
[22:06:30] <berglar> mm yes
[22:06:33] <berglar> i have a whole bunch of them
[22:06:51] <berglar> i want to get the total height of the text
[22:07:31] <amccloud> berglar: http://jsfiddle.net/es7dr/ or http://jsfiddle.net/es7dr/1/
[22:08:08] <berglar> oh so nice
[22:08:12] <berglar> thank you!
[22:10:18] <amccloud> rgr: does it only have one class?
[22:10:54] <rgr> no. and that shouldnt matter. its ok. I just do a length test on the selctor. works. thanks.
[22:11:35] <amccloud> rgr: yup thats the way to go
[22:16:10] <defaultro> hey folks, I need some help regarding ajax. The server is taking a long time to respond but it responds. How can I add a waittime?
[22:24:02] <sweb> i want change some array input via jquery ? $('#arrayInput').val(myArray) ? is it correct ?
[22:24:50] <pranavrc> I have a form called userform and a jquery handler for getting the string that the user types in formString = $('#userform'); When I use alert(formString), it gives me [object Object]. What I need is the string that's been typed in by the user, so that I can compare it with another string. How can I do this?
[22:31:16] <Cork> sweb: what do you mean by array input?
[22:31:54] <Cork> pranavrc: you need to grab the input field, not the form
[22:32:01] <Cork> and run .val on it see ?.val
[22:32:09] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[22:33:37] <pranavrc> Cork, alright, swell, thanks!
[22:33:44] <Cork> defaultro: you mean you want a ticking timer?
[22:34:06] <Cork> defaultro: or just show a throbber while its waiting?
[22:34:28] <rgr> whats the correct way to run a function on a single element? Still use each()?
[22:34:28] <rgr> or rather on $(this)?
[22:34:29] <rgr> oh ignore that.... doh
[22:34:42] <Cork> :)
[22:44:30] <pranavrc> Cork, I'm getting the data from the form because I need to serialize() it and send it via an ajax request. If I get just the string, it's returning a bad request error. Is there a fix for this?
[22:48:04] <sweb> Cork: create an array input ... <input name=arr[] ... i want to set value of this
[22:53:08] <Cork> sweb: ok, forms doesn't have a concept of arrays
[22:53:33] <Cork> "arr[]" is just a field name just like "password"
[22:54:10] <Cork> pranavrc: ok, if you want to send the complete form to the server serialize works
[22:54:26] <Cork> pranavrc: just make sure the input form has a name attribute
[22:54:53] <Cork> pranavrc: then on the server side request the value for that field and you should be good to go
[22:55:15] <Cork> the serialized value isn't something you can use in js though
[22:55:48] <Cork> pranavrc: alternativlely you can use serializeArray
[22:56:05] <Cork> it gives you an array that you can modify, and submit
[22:56:32] <Ghost1227> quick (hopefully) question. say i've got a form which consists of two fields, a select field and a text field. if the select field is changed to option b, i want to replace the text field with another select field. how would i go about doing this?
[22:56:53] <pranavrc> Cork, I have a name attribute in the input form...can I use serialize on a string, though?
[22:57:00] <pranavrc> and send it in an ajax request?
[22:57:04] <Cork> Ghost1227: best option is prob to not replace it, but show and hide them
[22:57:23] <Cork> pranavrc: one sec
[23:01:30] <Ghost1227> Cork: that's what i suspected
[23:01:31] <Ghost1227> thanks
[23:04:02] <Cork> pranavrc: sorry for the delay got a few things i had to take care of http://jsfiddle.net/ZTu99/
[23:06:50] <pranavrc> Cork, I will take a look at that and get back, thanks!
[23:11:00] <pranavrc> Cork, alright, perfect! One more thing, though. What I'm trying to do is this - I get the form data, get the string in the input box using serializeArray()[0] as you suggested, compare the string with another, and if it doesn't match, I need to assign the string "default" to the form data. How can I do this?
[23:12:15] <pranavrc> as in
[23:12:44] <pranavrc> if (f.serializeArray()[0] == "someString") { make "default" the string to be sent through the ajax function }
[23:13:39] <pranavrc> else { send $('#form').serialize() through the ajax function }
[23:15:07] <Cork> thats overkill
[23:15:24] <Cork> if you just want the value of the input field and nothing else use .val on the input field
[23:18:19] <pranavrc> Cork, i could do this by just changing the content of the input field to "default" and acquiring the form data again, right?
[23:20:46] <Cork> pranavrc: i don't follow why you want to serialize the form when all you want is to check the content of a specific field
[23:22:27] <pranavrc> Cork, i get the form content, and serialize it to send it to a server through an ajax request. In the case that the form content (the input box content) is empty, I need to make sure that a "default" string is sent to the server
[23:23:32] <pranavrc> when I type "foo" into the form, and receive it in the server using the name of the input box, i get "foo" alright. I just want to get "default" when I submit an empty form.
[23:24:05] <LoneStar99> how would i make the following div scrollable --> http://jsfiddle.net/Kw2Ry/
[23:24:20] <LoneStar99> thanks in advance
[23:24:32] <tw2113> you mean like a scrollbar inside?
[23:24:39] <Cork> pranavrc: http://jsfiddle.net/ZTu99/3/
[23:25:20] <LoneStar99> tw2113: like scrollable outside, like a browser type thing
[23:25:30] <tw2113> ?.scroll @ tw2113
[23:25:30] <bot-t> tw2113, .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[23:26:48] <LoneStar99> bot-t thanks
[23:27:18] <tw2113> i was looking the function up for personal reference
[23:55:07] <defaultro> hey folks, anyone alive?
