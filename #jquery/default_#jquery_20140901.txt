[00:14:19] <JohnFree> Hi guys. When I insert new DOM-Elements via Ajax into my page and look at the static HTML-source-code, the change is not shown. It seems like only the user interface is changed, but not the static html file. why?
[00:14:54] <Cork> JohnFree: exactly what you said
[00:15:02] <Cork> the browser uses dom not html
[00:15:15] <Cork> so if you do source view you will see the html the dom was generated from
[00:15:20] <Cork> not what the dom contains
[00:15:34] <Cork> most modern browsers has a view dom option
[00:15:43] <JohnFree> Cork: Ah ok.
[00:15:44] <Cork> and there you should see the element your after
[00:16:00] <JohnFree> Cork: But a question
[00:16:38] <JohnFree> Cork: When I request a HTMl-page I get the static HTML-page. How does e.g. Google search within this static HTML-pages?
[00:16:58] <Cork> JohnFree: not sure what you mean
[00:17:04] <FriedZombie> I know if you use firefox select the whole page (crtl + a) right click and choose view source from selection the html it shows is generated from the dom
[00:17:16] <JohnFree> Cork: I mean Google only is seeing the static page and not the content which is added via Ajax after the static HTML-page is loaded
[00:17:35] <Cork> JohnFree: google bots run js since quite a while back
[00:17:50] <Cork> but yes, normally you should contain the data statically for bots
[00:18:29] <litropy> Johnathan1707, that's getting into SEO. And you're correct - if you want your entire site, and not just the index, which loads not searchable content, to be seen by Google, you have to have to do something a bit different.
[00:18:32] <JohnFree> ok
[00:18:42] <litropy> JohnFree, ^^
[00:19:07] <litropy> Whoops, corrected by Cork
[00:19:24] <Cork> litropy: ya, google bots can handle ajax
[00:19:31] <Cork> but many others can't
[00:19:44] <JohnFree> Someone sent me this link. It sounds not serious:  http://s422803032.mialojamiento.es/
[00:19:46] <litropy> Alrighty. Onto my question. I'm having a bunch of trouble implementing History.js
[00:20:02] <litropy> Please give me a moment to collect my thoughts.
[00:20:12] <Cork> http://mashable.com/2010/06/25/google-javascript/
[00:21:28] <Cork> http://www.webmasterworld.com/google/4159807.htm
[00:21:48] <litropy> Does this chan prefer a specific paste bin?
[00:22:09] <litropy> ah, just read the MOTD
[00:22:10] <Cork> ?paste
[00:22:10] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:26:41] <litropy> http://jsfiddle.net/zh0mjh2k/
[00:28:01] <litropy> That works, however, I'm a bit concerned that I'm getting Uncaught Error: History.js Adapter has already been loaded... // multiple times.
[00:28:26] <MACscr> http://jsfiddle.net/7raLrju6/3/
[00:28:46] <MACscr> cant seem to figure out how to get that filtering to work
[00:29:05] <MACscr> maybe i need to try a different plugin that works better with dynamic content
[00:29:07] <Cork> litropy: you need to load the history.js in "external resources"
[00:30:42] <litropy> Also, I thought the ajax success parameter meant, "Do this when all data is transferred." But now I'm thinking it just means, "Okay, things are good - transferring data now."
[00:31:08] <litropy> Why I say this is my page goes blank for a good 10 secs sometimes.
[00:31:24] <litropy> Cork, not sure what you mean.
[00:32:13] <zagaza> hi guys, I am also having an ajax problem right now, http://danielnikolovski.com/ when you press one of those portfolio items then press back it doesn't go back because the initial content isn't loaded with ajax, is there any better solution? because, if I load the initial content with ajax, I need to do pushstate on it for the backbutton to work, and then it shows /index.html in the url
[00:32:54] <litropy> zagaza, careful with pushstate - you need to fall back to the old hashchange for many browsers.
[00:35:17] <litropy> zagaza, /index.html isn't acceptable?
[00:35:45] <zagaza> well it looks garbage
[00:35:59] <Cork> litropy: http://jsfiddle.net/zh0mjh2k/1/
[00:36:04] <Cork> (sorry for the delay)
[00:36:41] <Cork> litropy: so the error you get is cause you most likely load <script src="<someting>/history.js"></script> from your content you load in the ajax call
[00:36:48] <Cork> (just guessing though)
[00:37:12] <Cork> litropy: not really many no
[00:37:14] <litropy> Cork, you're correct. I see what you're saying now.
[00:37:29] <Cork> old ie and old iphone and really old android
[00:37:48] <litropy> Cork, IE 10 doesn't support it
[00:37:59] <donni> hi how to set an active state of accordion ui?
[00:38:11] <Cork> litropy: you mean ie9 right?
[00:38:18] <Cork> cause ie10 works jus fine here
[00:38:23] <Cork> *just
[00:38:45] <Cork> and yes ie9 == old ie
[00:38:58] <litropy> Cork, correct again :-)
[00:39:03] <Cork> ie> 9 == ancient
[00:39:21] <litropy> I don't know why I'm blabbering. Maybe it's because it's close to 4pm here.
[00:39:23] <litropy> am
[00:39:28] <Cork> heh
[00:39:37] <Cork> you mean you just woke up? ;P
[00:39:42] <MACscr> no ideas on my issue? =P
[00:39:58] <litropy> Cork, nope, going on 18 hrs thus far.
[00:40:06] <Cork> litropy: nice...
[00:41:20] <litropy> Cork, at what point in my ajax call would I run my StartMyFancyAnimatedLoadIndicator() // ?
[00:41:25] <Cork> MACscr: why not do the filter job in css instead?
[00:41:59] <MACscr> Cork: because i need cool animations? =P
[00:42:00] <Cork> litropy: ajaxStart?
[00:42:14] <Cork> MACscr: css3 @keyframe?
[00:42:24] <Cork> litropy: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[00:42:54] <MACscr> Cork: im trying to do something like so: http://ookla.domains/
[00:43:09] <MACscr> though ive obviously simplified my example for troubleshooting
[00:43:28] <MACscr> i dont think the plugin im using will even work for my purpose as i need to filter results even as the divs are created
[00:43:30] <MACscr> so not just after
[00:43:53] <Cork> MACscr: never seen the shuffle plugin before so not sure what it does
[00:44:37] <MACscr> Cork: does that fancy shuffle/filter when you click on a filter link that you see on a lot of portfolio themes
[00:47:22] <litropy> Cork, thanks, I think that's it. And do you see on line 15 how I load the content into the page? http://jsfiddle.net/zh0mjh2k/2/ Should I be doing it in "success" like that? Because my page goes blank for like 10 seconds sometimes (no visual external elements yet)
[00:47:49] <litropy> Also, I'm not sure, but did you modify my code? I saw the /1/ there.
[00:48:33] <Cork> litropy: not sure what you mean
[00:48:49] <Cork> litropy: the /1/ is for the External Resources reference
[00:49:01] <Cork> (check on the left)
[00:49:53] <litropy> Cork, apologies - I don't see it. First time with jsfiddle
[00:50:03] <Cork> no prob
[00:50:48] <litropy> Aaah I see
[00:53:57] <elmcrest> Hey everyone. I still struggle with js and jquery :/ ... however, I'd expect the console.log to work when I write something in any <td> within my table. But it isn't ... https://dpaste.de/7en3
[00:54:57] <Cork> elmcrest: is the tr really static?
[00:55:22] <Cork> i suspect it isn't and you want $('#caclPosTable').on('keyup', 'td', function(){
[00:55:25] <elmcrest> Cork the first one is static, but I add several more with a button
[00:55:45] <elmcrest> Cork yes ... I think I tried that too but ok, I'll check again
[00:56:50] <elmcrest> Cork lol ... yes I works... besides I did a typo with the selector... the ID is "calcPosTable" not "caclPosTable" :D
[00:56:54] <elmcrest> *it
[00:56:57] <elmcrest> Cork thx ^^
[00:57:01] <Cork> yw
[01:10:11] <elmcrest> Cork I do now itterate through my <tr> and save the values in a new Object. The problem now is, that I have a <select> within the Row (unit)... is it a good approach to use the index which each() gives me with if (index===2) f.e. and then get the selected option?
[01:10:23] <elmcrest> I hope I explained good enough what I mean ^^
[01:10:40] <Cork> elmcrest: store .val()
[01:11:01] <Cork> and to restore (of you need) do .val(old_value)
[01:11:07] <Cork> of==if
[01:11:24] <elmcrest> Cork ok I try that thx again
[01:15:55] <popl> I guess I solved my problem. Interestingly, the e.preventDefault() seems to be working but only when it's at the beginning of the function definition.
[01:16:25] <popl> It's curious because I'm disabling some keypress action in a text input elsewhere just by returning false.
[01:17:23] <Cork> popl: yes calling preventDefault() later in the event can sometimes end up in a race condition
[01:18:01] <Cork> popl: also if you by keypress mean the keypress event, don't use it
[01:18:10] <Cork> use keydown keypress is depricated in the dom spec
[01:18:16] <Cork> (and doesn't work in all browsers)
[01:18:47] <popl> Cork: That's good to know, thank you.
[01:18:51] <popl> Cork: What would you recommend?
[01:19:08] <Cork> "<Cork> use keydown keypress is depricated in the dom spec"
[01:19:36] <Cork> on the web keydown is == keypress in native apps
[01:19:50] <Cork> and keydown in native apps doesn't exist on the web
[01:20:01] <frank_o> Cork: Hi! Regarding your pie timer SVG animation: http://jsfiddle.net/xgjpL3bg/8/
[01:20:12] <frank_o> Cork: Over at http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xgjpL3bg/9/ -- I had to remove the `begin="me.mouseover"` because I need the animation to start when hovering the SVG's parent. Is there still a way to get rid of that initial 1ms flickering you see when you hover on and off really fast?
[01:20:53] <Cork> frank_o: you can most likely trigger the animation from js
[01:21:12] <Cork> frank_o: the delay you had was to quite a degree from the wrong starting number
[01:21:25] <Cork> and that the browser has to parse the svg dom everytime
[01:23:50] <popl> Cork: Sorry, which one is deprecated? keydown or keypress, or did you mean to say both of them?
[01:24:00] <popl> I'm reading about the differences in some article right now.
[01:24:00] <frank_o> Cork: Right now I'm triggering the animation from js by copying it over into another div - http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xgjpL3bg/9/ - maybe that's not the best way?
[01:24:02] <Cork> popl: keypress
[01:24:10] <popl> Cork: Ok, thanks.
[01:24:20] <popl> Cork: I seriously hate browser inconsistency.
[01:24:40] <Cork> popl: that is why they removed it
[01:25:13] <popl> can we just remove inconsistent browsers? ;P
[01:25:29] <Cork> frank_o: you are still parsing the svg document every time
[01:25:57] <Cork> frank_o: only difference is that you first serialize it from dom into html before you push the html for parsing again
[01:26:44] <rahuldroy> hi guys, for some odd reason $(document).ready is firing twice. Does anyone know how to track the source
[01:27:19] <frank_o> Cork: I see. but theres a better way to trigger it from js then without parsing the svg every time?
[01:27:45] <frank_o> Cork: also you mention a wrong starting number. that was before right, in the current fiddle everything is alright?
[01:28:35] <Snoopal> i have dom which is added via ajax. i have an event which triggers. it does everything i like expect of hiding and showing some elements at the end (only in IE). any idea about that?
[01:30:35] <AdamPDotty> expect = except?
[01:31:18] <Snoopal> sorry. ofc except :D
[01:31:40] <Snoopal> and funny fact in IE8 it works IE9,10 and 11 not
[01:31:46] <Snoopal> iE 9,10
[01:33:14] <Cork> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/xgjpL3bg/10/
[01:33:28] <Cork> frank_o: you have to reset the animation location though
[01:33:40] <AdamPDotty> but with that information we can only provide wild guesses
[01:34:16] <Cork> frank_o: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/xgjpL3bg/11/
[01:34:27] <AdamPDotty> might be a "," at the end of an enumeration, a color with alpha-channel
[01:34:46] <Snoopal> ok. i am at the ajax checkout process of woocommerce. i have some actions which are triggered by clicking on a button. it hides a lot of elements. But it does not hide one specific
[01:34:53] <Snoopal> in other browsers it works
[01:35:16] <sprihodko> Hi! Can I prevent default action of ajax .get action? What i need, is to redirect to another url when visiting root path
[01:35:24] <Snoopal> and also in IE8 it works, in IE9+ it doesnt work anymore
[01:35:44] <AdamPDotty> best create a fiddle
[01:36:04] <Snoopal> its hard to fiddle cause it loads source from ajax
[01:36:07] <Snoopal> via ajax
[01:36:10] <Cork> Snoopal: your using jquery to hide the elements?
[01:36:18] <Snoopal> Cork yes
[01:36:25] <Cork> fiddle it
[01:36:36] <Snoopal> jQuery('#place_order').removeClass('checkout-disabled');
[01:37:12] <Cork> Snoopal: and what does jQuery('#place_order').length give you in ie9+?
[01:39:21] <Snoopal> 1
[01:39:50] <Cork> and jQuery('#place_order').hasClass('checkout-disabled') ?
[01:39:56] <Cork> (before you run it in the code)
[01:40:06] <Cork> also run it again after
[01:42:39] <Snoopal> ok. i found the problem
[01:42:41] <Snoopal> damnit :D
[01:43:07] <Snoopal> .on('DOMSubtreeModified' <-- seems to work a bit different in IE9+ ?
[01:43:11] <Snoopal> than in other browsers
[01:43:24] <Cork> Snoopal: DOMSubtreeModified is depricated
[01:43:28] <frank_o> Cork: very very interesting indeed - thank you so much!
[01:43:31] <Cork> you shouldn't depend on it
[01:44:00] <Snoopal> and whats there instead of it?
[01:44:46] <Cork> Snoopal: currently; nothing
[01:45:05] <Cork> but MutationObserver is meant to take its place
[01:45:13] <Cork> ?g mdn mutationobserver
[01:45:15] <fRAiLtY-> On this site, can someone tell me what's causing the 3 icons to appear when you hover the "products" underneath the blurb at the top http://www.grabmi.co.uk/2015-Calendars
[01:45:19] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API Interfaces | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[01:45:31] <last1> I have a php script that returns accents
[01:45:46] <last1> I mean, json data that contains accents
[01:45:59] <last1> like this, for example: OlÃ¡
[01:46:22] <last1> I get this data in javascript using $.ajax({..
[01:46:45] <Snoopal> Cork well that sucks. i need to trigger as soon as a dom  receives a specific class during ajax request.
[01:46:45] <last1> yet when I assign the data from json, it sets the OlÃ¡ to null
[01:47:03] <last1> can't jquery accept accents ?
[01:47:12] <Cork> Snoopal: parse the html and search for it before you add it to the page
[01:47:18] <Cork> then you don't need the event
[01:47:36] <Cork> last1: too little info, but no it should work just fine
[01:47:50] <Snoopal> what do you mean by parse the html and search for it?
[01:49:04] <last1> well.. it doesn't
[01:49:28] <last1> if I do a print_r() from the php script I see the data just fine and even the jquery works just fine without data that has accents
[01:49:35] <Cork> last1: you need to provide more info
[01:49:42] <last1> ok, what can I provide you with ?
[01:49:46] <Cork> "doesn't work" isn't something someone can look at
[01:50:17] <last1> http://pastebin.com/Hg34qNfK
[01:50:23] <last1> this is how I load the data from my php script
[01:50:24] <frank_o> Cork: Is there a way to make it work on subsequent mouseovers? And to make it hide on completion, should I just set `display: none` after a `setTimeout`? Here's the actual use case (not yet polished though): http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/450xuys7/
[01:50:39] <Cork> last1: is the server response accessable?
[01:51:01] <Cork> frank_o: you mean after it goes to full?
[01:51:06] <Cork> frank_o: looks like a chrome bug
[01:51:28] <last1> cork: yes, this is what the network response looks like
[01:51:29] <last1> {"returncode":1,"returndata":{"vacation":{"enable":"1","vmessage":null}
[01:51:42] <Cork> last1: i meant do you have a working url?
[01:51:43] <last1> that's json, but vmessage should contain text, not null
[01:51:48] <Cork> preferably one that allows cors
[01:52:00] <frank_o> Cork: Yep, should disappear when done ideally.
[01:52:07] <last1> it's not public unfortunately
[01:52:11] <Cork> frank_o: uh, it does here
[01:52:35] <Cork> frank_o: but like i said -- in chrome, when the animation reaches 100% the svg animation dies
[01:52:41] <Cork> frank_o: you would have to dig into why
[01:52:55] <Cork> cause it shouldn't do that
[01:53:07] <frank_o> Cork: cool thanks
[01:53:19] <frank_o> Cork: yeah its working on subsequent mouseovers now
[01:53:48] <Cork> last1: ok, hears the situation, for testing what i needed is somewhere where the js can run and the server response can be seen
[01:54:01] <Cork> last1: pastebins of the body content of the response won't help
[01:54:31] <last1> but if php sends the json properly
[01:54:33] <Cork> last1: so with the data you've shared all i can say is "it should work"
[01:54:42] <last1> I know, it "should" :)
[01:54:46] <Cork> and "it works fine for me"
[01:54:57] <last1> should I encode the data in any way on the php side ?
[01:55:02] <Cork> without access to the problem your basically on your own
[01:55:15] <Cork> last1: json should always be utf8
[01:58:20] <Cork> last1: http://jsfiddle.net/u2om4vh3/
[01:59:03] <last1> issue solved: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3694346/values-in-utf-8-being-encoded-as-null-in-json
[02:01:58] <last1> thank you Cork
[02:02:39] <frank_o> Cork: something like this maybe? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xgjpL3bg/12/
[02:02:59] <Cork> frank_o: yuck....
[02:03:03] <Cork> no
[02:03:21] <frank_o> hehe
[02:03:38] <frank_o> oh dear..
[02:04:16] <frank_o> yeah plus id need some additional code to reset the timeout =/
[02:07:55] <sprihodko> Guys, need some help. How can i redirect to new url on visiting root url via .ajax?
[02:12:06] <Cork> frank_o: seams like the envEvent actually kills the <animate> in chrome >_<
[02:16:40] <frank_o> Cork: damn =/
[02:17:01] <Cork> frank_o: ya, chrome does this for images too
[02:17:04] <Cork> it is a pain
[02:27:09] <sprihodko> Here I get it worked, but now i have infinite loop https://gist.github.com/sprihodko/431e47b54f4b97589bb9. Can i run it only once and then remove ajax script from code?
[02:28:22] <frank_o> Cork: sure is
[02:28:38] <frank_o> Cork: but wait, the animation is suppose to remove itself on completion? using firefox currently
[02:29:02] <frank_o> Cork: or should i use my yucky removePie(); thingie for now?
[02:30:09] <Cork> frank_o: the original svg works just fine here
[02:30:14] <Cork> in firefox that is
[02:31:41] <Cork> frank_o: btw have you tried moving the animations to a definition instead?
[02:31:48] <Cork> that might work better (donno)
[02:35:52] <Cork> frank_o: btw the setTimeout doesn't work in chrome for me
[02:42:54] <sprihodko> If i set url: "/" in ajax function it works also for "/a" "/a/b" and so on. How can i set url to work only on root url?
[02:43:34] <Baluse> hello. I have an event at a select box change();
[02:43:56] <Baluse> however because it takes about half second to do the dom at mobile
[02:43:57] <litropy> within an .each(function(){}), how do I tell it to skip a matched element? Something like:  if ( $(this).attr("id") === 'logo' ) {  skip it and go to the next one! }
[02:44:36] <Baluse> select box selected item doesnt appear unless you blur
[02:46:18] <frank_o> Cork: in firefox 31 (and chrome 36) http://jsfiddle.net/xgjpL3bg/11/ works fine too except when it's done it remains in the window (until i move the mouse out of `.test`)
[02:47:34] <frank_o> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xgjpL3bg/12/ with the setTimeout only seems to work in firefox, yeah
[02:52:10] <jop008> is this the way to walk thru options of a select ?   $('select').each(function() {      $('option').each(function() {
[02:52:10] <Cork> frank_o: in firefox you can bind endEvent instead of the timeout (sorry was a bit confusing before)
[02:52:39] <Cork> jop008: "yes", but what is the real question=
[02:52:41] <Cork> *?
[02:53:25] <jop008> I was in doubt if the options were tight to the select since there is no link in the each statemnet
[02:54:08] <Cork> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/xgjpL3bg/14/
[02:54:16] <Cork> but ya, this doesn't solve the chrome bug
[02:54:38] <Cork> jop008: ah, now i get the question
[02:54:52] <jop008> this is different var options = $('#selectBox option');
[02:54:57] <Cork> jop008: in the first loop do $(this).children().each
[02:55:07] <Cork> instead of $('option')
[02:55:30] <Cork> alternatively $(this).find('option').each
[02:55:33] <Cork> if you use groups
[02:57:06] <jop008> so changed it to this $('select').each(function() {     var oselect = $(this);     cid = oselect.attr ("id") ;     $( "#" + cid +' option').each(function() {
[02:57:20] <Cork> uh... no
[02:57:45] <Cork> $('select').each(function() { $(this).find(' option').each(function() {
[02:57:48] <Cork> should work just fine
[02:57:55] <Cork> opps
[02:57:59] <Cork> * $('select').each(function() { $(this).find('option').each(function() {
[03:01:43] <frank_o> Cork: nice!
[03:01:57] <Cork> frank_o: well it still doesn't work so...
[03:02:04] <frank_o> Cork: yeah =/
[03:02:22] <tangorri> hi
[03:02:30] <jop008> why I needed because an autocomplete field must interact with a selectlist. The user can add items using autocomplete. But there must be a way to deselect also
[03:02:43] <tangorri> I'm wondering how I can add scrollbars to gridster container ...
[03:03:00] <tangorri> setting overflow collapses it
[03:06:30] <Cork> frank_o: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=104503
[03:12:59] <Cork> seams to be bug in chrome with freeze
[03:13:02] <litropy> I keep loading a page within a page with $.ajax. My success looks like $('#loadpane').html($(data).find('#ajaxcontainer').html());
[03:13:02] <zagaza> super newbie question but how do I target multiple vars? like melt them into one line instead of var1.addClass('fadeout'); var2.addClass('fadeout');
[03:13:02] <zagaza> var1, var2.addClass('fadeout'); didn't work
[03:13:02] <Cork> zagaza: $(v1).add(v2).add(v3).addClass()
[03:13:02] <litropy> Yet, it's still shoving in stuff above it.
[03:13:02] <litropy> Like the <head> content, without the <head> tag.
[03:13:02] <zagaza> cool Cork, so this is valid? subpage.add(grid).addClass('fadein');
[03:13:02] <Cork> litropy: loading full pages and grabbing parts of the result is not recommended
[03:13:02] <zagaza> since i have subpage and grid as variables
[03:13:03] <Cork> litropy: send partials from the server instead
[03:13:03] <Cork> zagaza: yes
[03:13:03] <zagaza> neat ty
[03:13:03] <litropy> Cork, I'm not sure what you mean. Can I request partials?
[03:13:03] <Cork> litropy: only the server can control that
[03:13:03] <Cork> litropy: basically split the source file so you have one that is just the data you want
[03:13:03] <Cork> and include that in the main page
[03:13:03] <Cork> and for ajax just request the partial
[03:13:04] <Cork> no need to send all that data if you don't need it
[03:13:30] <litropy> Cork, I'm thinking ...
[03:14:14] <Cork> litropy: if you really need to handle the full page
[03:14:28] <Cork> you have to resort to hacks
[03:15:02] <Cork> $('#loadpane').html($("<div>").append($.parseHTML(data)).find('#ajaxcontainer'));
[03:15:04] <litropy> Cork, so two files per page: one for URL links, which contain the full page, and another for ajax?
[03:15:17] <Cork> but please fix the source instead of killing kittens...
[03:15:28] <Cork> litropy: yes
[03:15:28] <litropy> Cork, or is there a more elegant method using server-side scripting
[03:15:46] <Cork> litropy: that is normally what server side does
[03:16:01] <litropy> Cork, thanks
[03:16:14] <Cork> <?php include_once('links.html'); ?>
[03:16:19] <Cork> (for php)
[03:16:24] <Cork> same exist for most any language
[03:19:53] <frank_o> Cork: jesus, reported in 2011?? :)
[03:20:12] <Cork> frank_o: that isn't special
[03:20:21] <frank_o> oh
[03:20:24] <Cork> in complex softwares it takes time to fix bugs
[03:20:33] <frank_o> true...
[03:20:38] <Cork> and this one isn't even confirmed yet
[03:27:18] <jop008> if you have the option in memory how to reach the select?
[03:29:31] <Cork> jop008: .closest('select') if that is what you mean
[03:29:47] <jop008> I test this
[03:30:03] <jop008> but not hitting the select
[03:30:32] <Cork> jop008: that line should ALWAYS give you the select if the option is in the tree
[03:30:45] <jop008> This is in my node Object
[03:30:45] <jop008> html: "<option value="-1">Choose reversed entitytype, please note multiple items can be selected</option>"
[03:30:46] <jop008> id: "auto_sel_entitytype2"
[03:31:07] <Cork> so you don't have an option element you have json?
[03:31:10] <jop008> so the option is hanigng in the air
[03:31:21] <Cork> ya, it isn't even a dom element
[03:31:29] <jop008> It is an option but I dig further
[03:31:35] <Cork> it is a string
[03:31:42] <Cork> in an object it looks like
[03:32:35] <jop008> if is the outcome of $(oel)
[03:32:43] <jop008> oel is a domtree element
[03:32:57] <jop008> but no parent and no select so weird
[03:33:14] <Cork> jop008: and what is oel?
[03:36:48] <jop008> I see indeed just a string
[03:38:15] <Cork> so, what you have is a unattached option element
[03:38:27] <Cork> parsed from html by jquery
[03:38:35] <Cork> so you can't find a partent to it, cause there isn't one
[03:42:54] <shebbi> Has anyone done this logic before: you do a jquery validation on a form on foo.php, if it pass, direct to bar.php to do a server-side validation. anyone?
[03:59:57] <litropy> Cork, would it be better to use $.load as opposed to $.ajax for my purposes?
[04:00:13] <Cork> litropy: it is a shorthand, it does the same thing
[04:00:23] <litropy> Cork, thanks
[04:10:38] <tiblock> Hi. Help me with bug please. http://jsfiddle.net/Lypu56fL/ when you press CTRL status swithcing, but if you press Ctrl+F it will not swithc and i have very bad bug. Tested in chrome and firefox. How i can fix it?
[04:11:03] <tiblock> mod, xicuuu is a spam bot, sent me URL in private
[04:11:47] <Cork> tiblock: report it to #freenode
[04:12:13] <Cork> tiblock: about the status thing
[04:12:31] <Cork> tiblock: best option is prob to always reset the state on .blur
[04:13:07] <Cork> tiblock: http://jsfiddle.net/Lypu56fL/1/
[04:13:41] <tiblock> Cork, thank you, that works
[04:14:43] <Cork> tiblock: note though that if you click outside the page while holding the ctrl
[04:14:47] <Cork> and then click in again
[04:14:50] <Cork> the state will be wrong
[04:15:00] <Cork> but it sounds like a small enough edge case
[04:15:16] <tiblock> ya its fine
[04:16:05] <Biwaa> Hi i'm looking for a sample or a plugin that make the same as a random choice from a list. For exemple, i have a list of name and i want it to roll for 3-4 sec and then pick up a name and show it
[04:16:41] <Cork> Biwaa: by list do you mean an array or <ul>?
[04:21:10] <Biwaa> Cork: an array, well at start i meant data from a json or something like that
[04:25:26] <Cork> Biwaa: so just do array[Math.random(array.length)]
[04:25:32] <Cork> opps sorry
[04:25:43] <Cork> i always mix the random syntaxes
[04:25:51] <Biwaa> yea but i want an animation :) it's for a presentation
[04:25:57] <Cork> Biwaa: so just do array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)]
[04:26:14] <Cork> animate an array?
[04:26:26] <Cork> sooo you want to randomly pick an ul?
[04:26:33] <Cork> or rather an li in an ul?
[04:26:51] <Cork> cause animate a section of memory doesn't make sense
[04:27:47] <MagePsycho> is there any lazy loading plugin for showing list of product images .. (note that the product images has also flipover image)
[04:28:08] <Cork> MagePsycho: there is plenty of them
[04:28:13] <Cork> just look around a bit
[04:28:46] <MagePsycho> Cork: yeah but only for single image . but not for image change on hover of that image
[04:28:48] <MagePsycho> getting my poing
[04:28:53] <MagePsycho> point*
[04:30:10] <jop008> this $('<optGroup/>').attr('label', $(this).text()).appendTo(oselect); inserts an optgroup as lastitem of a select how to make it the first item?
[04:30:13] <Cork> MagePsycho: you normally don't want lacy loading of hover images
[04:30:22] <Cork> as that results in delay showing the image
[04:30:33] <MagePsycho> Cork: may be you are right
[04:30:47] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com prepend
[04:30:53] <b-ot> Cork: .prepend() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[04:30:59] <Biwaa> Cork: i'll have a list of names. i want to present that on a screen and choose randomly someone who subscribe to the contest. But i want it with suspense, like all the name scroll until we show the winner
[04:31:16] <jop008> I think prepend
[04:31:43] <Cork> Biwaa: can't say i've seen anything ready made for that
[04:31:50] <Cork> sounds a bit too specific
[04:31:58] <Cork> Biwaa: shouldn't be too hard though

[04:32:13] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ScrollTo â†’ http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[04:32:29] <Cork> just grab the set of lis and random pick one
[04:32:36] <Cork> and then scrollTo that element
[04:32:36] <Biwaa> Cork: well yea i think i have to show random names during 4secs and then show the one that i want
[04:33:35] <Biwaa> thanks your for the advice
[04:40:07] <jop008> how to insert an item as the first item? build it up with a new list or can you insert directly to the toop?
[04:40:29] <Cork> jop008: i answered this the last time
[04:40:34] <Cork> + you asked
[05:11:41] <JohnFree> Hi guys. I've learned jQuery and are now interested in learning AngularJS.But somehow AngularJS looks quite difficult. Would you recommend me learning AngularJS?
[05:16:08] <jop008> This is 1.4> fidddle in 1.3.2 I had to make the fist option selected of a selectlist to give it a title
[05:16:47] <jop008> So I tought generate an optgroup aboive as the first item. However you can see that the optgroup is not treated properly
[05:17:44] <jop008> In 1.4 the first item is the title so you must create fake first items to tell the user what to choose
[05:18:22] <elmcrest> Is there a way to push an object to an array and after that update if values are changed?
[05:20:07] <elmcrest> JohnFree backbone.js seems "near" at jquery - but I have no experience in neither backbone nor angular ... and actually near to no experience with jquery ;)
[05:20:19] <elmcrest> JohnFree that's only from what I've read so far
[05:25:51] <jop008> I think I need http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/rh7Nq/
[05:43:30] <Hausas> I have an input field that's <input id="integer" type="number">. How do I retrieve a value from that input even if it's invalid ($("#integer").val() returns empty string if the value in input is non valid)
[05:44:26] <Cork> Hausas: could you make a fiddle of the problem?
[05:44:37] <Cork> but i suspect the answer is "you can't"
[05:44:45] <Hausas> w8 a sec
[05:44:57] <brettfrable> value = $("#txt_name").attr('value');
[05:45:00] <Cork> cause there is some extra limitations defined by the spec for the new form element types
[05:45:09] <brettfrable> try that
[05:45:13] <Cork> brettfrable: that will give you the initial value
[05:45:17] <Cork> not what the user entered
[05:45:31] <tiblock> Hausas, works for mehttp://jsfiddle.net/pnrct49r/
[05:45:35] <brettfrable> then run that on submit
[05:45:48] <Cork> brettfrable: that won't matter
[05:45:58] <Cork> attr('value') reads the string from the dom element
[05:46:04] <Cork> that was parsed from the html
[05:46:16] <Cork> it doesn't reflect the visible value of the form element
[05:46:16] <brettfrable> oh well.
[05:46:17] <brettfrable> i tried.
[05:47:10] <brettfrable> https://github.com/ivkremer/jquery-simple-combobox/issues/8
[05:47:26] <Cork> tiblock: heh your alert shows "" for me
[05:47:30] <Cork> in both chrome and firefox
[05:47:58] <Cork> tiblock: str: 1. enter "aaa" in the field, 2. click get => result alert is empty
[05:48:19] <Cork> though like i said, this is expected by the spec
[05:48:24] <tiblock> Cork, ofcourse its empty if you enter string, its type="number"
[05:48:35] <Cork> tiblock: did you read the question??
[05:49:06] <tangorri> nobody using grister ?
[05:49:15] <tiblock> Cork, okay, sorry then
[05:49:36] <Hausas> It doesn't work, tiblock
[05:49:46] <Hausas> try inputting 'a'
[05:50:13] <Hausas> Oh
[05:50:30] <hooligan321> heh good to see irc outlived MSN in the end
[05:50:41] <Hausas> So, Cork, the jsfiddle is ok for an example for my problem
[05:50:44] <Hausas> is it solvable?
[05:50:55] <Cork> Hausas: like i said, most likely no
[05:51:00] <Cork> but i'm checking
[05:51:11] <Hausas> Thanks
[05:52:04] <Hausas> I found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18852244/how-to-get-the-raw-value-an-input-type-number-field
[05:52:24] <Hausas> According to the WHATWG, you shouldn't be able to get the value unless it's valid numeric input. The input number field's sanitization algorithm says the browser is supposed to set the value to an empty string if the input isn't a valid floating point number.
[05:53:27] <voronika> tell me this: why do you want to return the value, and still have a different set type?
[05:54:10] <Hausas> Because I'm running regex on this
[05:54:21] <voronika> i mean, why have the set type
[05:54:22] <Hausas> and empty string passes the regex
[05:54:41] <Hausas> It has a nice feature of 'step'
[05:55:03] <voronika> if you're validating on your own, the type seems unnecessary
[05:55:04] <Cork> Hausas: ya, not possible
[05:55:18] <Hausas> Thanks, Cork
[05:55:24] <Cork> Hausas: if you need to handle none numeric values don't set type="number"
[05:55:41] <Cork> by the spec you tell the browser to only give you numbers
[05:56:20] <Hausas> Yeah, I figured that much after reading that stackOverflow
[05:56:28] <tiblock> Hausas, you asked for this, lol. http://jsfiddle.net/pnrct49r/3/ but really dont use it
[05:57:00] <Hausas> haha
[05:57:08] <Hausas> :D
[05:57:08] <Hausas> This is just awful
[05:57:28] <Hausas> I love your way of thinking though
[05:57:50] <Cork> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#number-state-%28type=number%29
[05:57:57] <Cork> "The value attribute, if specified and not empty, must have a value that is a valid floating-point number."
[05:58:17] <Cork> and "The value sanitization algorithm is as follows: If the value of the element is not a valid floating-point number, then set it to the empty string instead."
[06:01:04] <Cork> voronika: actually type does more then just validation
[06:01:25] <Cork> it lets you get a different touch keyboard on onscreen keyboards
[06:01:30] <Cork> more optimized for numbers
[06:01:45] <tiblock> Hausas, you can try use this i think http://jsfiddle.net/pnrct49r/4/
[06:02:33] <Cork> tiblock: that doesn't look even close to native...
[06:02:51] <Hausas> I don't want any dodgy workarounds
[06:04:53] <Cork> your best option is to just not use type="number"
[06:06:37] <jnz> Hi all
[06:07:01] <jnz> i have this data coming from a ajax error and i want to grab the error message
[06:07:02] <jnz> {"password":["The password confirmation does not match."]}
[06:07:22] <Woet> okay?
[06:07:30] <jnz> i use the each() to get each error message, but how do i reach the actual message
[06:07:47] <Woet> did you read the docs?
[06:07:49] <Cork> jnz: is the json part of the message from the server?
[06:07:52] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[06:07:55] <jnz> yes
[06:08:05] <Cork> so xhr.responseText?
[06:08:30] <Cork> if yes then JSON.parse(xhr.responseText).password[0]
[06:09:25] <Cork> or my error you mean in the success handler?
[06:09:47] <jnz> but the error could have any key
[06:10:08] <Woet> jnz: show your current code on www.pastie.org
[06:10:33] <Cork> well or event better jsfiddle.net
[06:10:37] <Cork> makes answering easier
[06:10:37] <jnz> http://laravel.io/bin/eLqb6
[06:10:46] <Woet> okay, jnz
[06:10:48] <Woet> now look at the docs
[06:11:10] <Woet> there is a reason I linked it.
[06:11:22] <jnz> i know, im looking
[06:11:29] <jnz> ahh!
[06:11:30] <jnz> shit
[06:11:32] <jnz> think i got it
[06:11:34] <Cork> interesting, didn't know jquery added a responseJSON
[06:12:04] <Cork> (in error handlers)
[06:12:11] <jnz> cool got it :) http://i.imgur.com/oywnoJ6.png
[06:12:32] <jnz> the second argument gives the value
[06:12:33] <jnz> derp
[06:13:36] <jnz> just how i wanted it: http://i.imgur.com/44jxXjy.png
[06:13:44] <jnz> thanks for helping :)
[06:14:07] <Hausas> I'm just gonna change type
[06:14:10] <Hausas> of input
[06:14:12] <Hausas> to tel
[06:15:43] <voronika> hausas: http://jsfiddle.net/kkd5ufrp/
[06:16:11] <voronika> though, you may want to capture backspace and delete, and clear out the var.
[06:17:32] <Hausas> That's still dodgy
[06:17:39] <Hausas> Nevermind, people
[06:17:42] <Hausas> I have a solution
[06:18:01] <voronika> go with the way that makes you most comfortable
[06:20:50] <hooligan321> THe power of bacon compels you
[06:21:53] <Hausas> Hmm
[06:22:02] <Hausas> Changing the type clears the value
[06:22:31] <Cork> Hausas: not all browsers let you change the type from number to text
[06:22:37] <Cork> so it is a nogo from the start
[06:50:18] <callumacrae> Heya! How can I question .on calls when it propogates? https://gist.github.com/callumacrae/7189abcd6d55300a4a9c
[06:52:30] <frank_o> yo callumacrae :)
[06:52:45] <frank_o> saw your PR on parallax.js - awesome stuff!
[06:54:49] <callumacrae> Haha, that was a while ago
[06:55:49] <frank_o> shame the author is ignoring it
[06:55:59] <frank_o> for whatever reason *shrugs*
[06:57:35] <Cork> callumacrae: you can chain the .on call on the same object
[06:57:56] <Cork> and if hte function is the same you can just add the event listeners in the event string
[06:58:03] <callumacrae> I'm looking for a way to do it without duplicating the .something selector
[06:58:31] <Cork> is the function the same?
[06:58:38] <Cork> not easy to tell from you gist
[06:58:56] <callumacrae> They're slightly different in functionality, the second one is better
[06:59:14] <Cork> no i meant is mouseout and click calling the same function?
[06:59:41] <callumacrae> Nah, that's just a smaller code sample
[07:00:27] <Cork> callumacrae: hmm from looking at the code
[07:00:42] <Cork> .on({}, '.selector') looks like is SHOULD work
[07:01:05] <Cork> never tried that though
[07:01:32] <callumacrae> I read the docs more carefully and they seem to agree
[07:01:37] <callumacrae> Didn't spot that the first time
[07:08:27] <quansai> Hey, guys.  I've created radio buttons that are under divs, so they're styled and whatnot. I can click the div and the radio button will be selected, but when I double click the radio button div more than once, I can't select any other radio buttons. It's like my ability to click divs in the radio field set freezes. Any way to prevent this from happening? Here's the jQuery: http://pastebin.com/bnGRaGz4
[07:11:46] <l8a> Hello. Is it possible to add/use something like a namespace when using jquery UI things?
[07:12:06] <jop008> I used this code http://jsfiddle.net/RB9Qw/39/
[07:12:20] <jop008> but in 1.4 the select list is invicbile
[07:13:47] <jop008> So is optgroup not working in jqM?
[07:14:24] <jeffreylevesque> how do i check if an input (type=file) has an uploaded file?
[07:16:45] <juslintek> Hi how to select specific key of json?
[07:17:18] <juslintek> When I do console.log(data["dropdown"]); it returns error, json looks like this: {"dropdown":"<option value=\"1\">Saliapke<\/option><option value=\"2\">Pijox<\/option>"}
[07:29:32] <tiblock> juslintek, if it causes error then something wrong in other part. Maybe whole "data" is undefined. What error says?
[07:30:04] <juslintek> tiblock, no I had to use JSON.parse
[07:30:10] <juslintek> Then I can select as object.
[07:31:57] <tiblock> juslintek, what error you see?
[07:34:21] <juslintek> I was getting Uncaught ReferenceError: dropdown is not defined, when I tried to select key of json like this: console.log(data[dropdown]);
[07:34:56] <juslintek> But then I added var data = JSON.parse(data); and changed it to data.dropdown and it worker. As well undefined variable on data.dropdown, if not parsed.
[07:35:45] <juslintek> Well on data.dropdown, its not that its error, I just get undefined data.
[07:37:26] <juslintek> tiblick, so after few tries of JSON.stringify, JSON.notify, JSON.parse worked :-D
[07:37:31] <juslintek> tiblock
[07:38:44] <juslintek> I prefer trial and error to reading complicatedly written docs, written by people who have no idea, how people understand things and their brain work. What visual and feel information has on human brain. ;-)
[07:38:58] <tiblock> juslintek, console.log(data[dropdown]); is wrong, you need console.log(data["dropdown"]);
[07:39:15] <juslintek> tiblock, second one returns undefined ;-)
[07:39:47] <juslintek> it works only after JSON.parse
[07:39:49] <tiblock> juslintek, if you enter in console "data" what it will show?
[07:40:08] <juslintek> my json looks like that: {"dropdown":"<option value=\"1\">Saliapke<\/option><option value=\"2\">Pijox<\/option>"}
[07:40:55] <juslintek> after JSON.parse it looks like this: Object {dropdown: "<option value="1">Saliapke</option><option value="2">Pijox</option>"}
[07:42:01] <juslintek> Without JSON.parse I get undefined
[07:43:51] <juslintek> So tiblock, now you know, that you can't output json without parsing. You can only text or html it, but it will only bring back data with extra {}
[07:44:50] <tiblock> juslintek, well your initial error "Uncaught ReferenceError: dropdown is not defined" is about you use data[dropdown] not data["dropdown"]
[07:45:30] <juslintek> tiblock, but still, it should return the content of json, behind selected key. Not undefined. After parse it returns defined data.
[07:47:00] <tiblock> juslintek, stringifyed JSON is just text, its string. Its not something magical. Its pure text. So yes, you can't get "string" keys from text
[08:03:46] <workerbeetwo> Hi. How do I select this.('#specialChild'); ?
[08:05:06] <elmcrest> workerbeetwo should be something like $(this).find('#specialChild') ... have to go, cu
[08:05:14] <workerbeetwo> thanks
[08:25:05] <jeffreylevesque> how do i convert `inputElement.addEventListener("change", handleFiles, false);` to jquery equivalent?
[08:26:02] <quansai> I've created radio buttons that are under divs, so they're styled and whatnot. I can click the div and the radio button will be selected, but when I double click the radio button div more than once, I can't select any other radio buttons. It's like my ability to click divs in the radio field set freezes. Any way to prevent this from happening? Here's the jQuery: http://pastebin.com/bnGRaGz4
[08:26:24] <uskerine> bootstrap is driving me nuts, how do you check if a checkbox is checked or not?
[08:26:44] <jeffreylevesque> never mind
[08:26:49] <jeffreylevesque> found out :)
[08:26:49] <afx237> anyone got any opinions on 'jquery file upload' vs dropzone?  i've been using plupload in the past, but it's too tightly integrated with its own queue GUI.
[08:36:25] <uskerine> how should be code the following IF test: if the span parent of a given ID has class "checked" do this
[08:36:54] <uskerine> is this fine?    if($('#withholdingFlag').closest('span').hasClass('checked'))
[08:37:53] <shoky> yes
[08:41:57] <Nomikos> uskerine: one thing I had to learn about closest() is it may also the match the *current* element, and then not check any parents
[08:42:15] <uskerine> thanks for the advice
[08:42:17] <uskerine> it works in this case
[08:42:24] <Nomikos> rocking
[08:42:38] <uskerine> for some weird reason you have to check the parent element of a checkbox with bootstrap (or with my current implementation of bootstrap)
[08:42:53] <uskerine> of course that stuff is totally undocumented
[08:43:26] * Nomikos files that away
[09:01:05] <uskerine> how do you program an event for a change on this item $('#foo').closest('span')  ?
[09:01:26] <robertmaxrees> you can't just generically watch nodes.
[09:01:43] <robertmaxrees> you need to emit an event on it when it changes, OR add a callback when your changes are done.
[09:01:45] <uskerine> please elaborate
[09:02:03] <uskerine> I just want to monitor that span (which surrounds a checkbox)
[09:02:16] <uskerine> and when the user checks or uncheck launch a function that updates other fields
[09:02:16] <robertmaxrees> why not watch the checkbox then?
[09:02:32] <robertmaxrees> $('input').on('change', function() {});
[09:02:34] <uskerine> because with my current implementation of bootstrap you have to watch the parent <span>
[09:02:51] <robertmaxrees> $('span').on('change', 'input', function() {});
[09:02:57] <uskerine> yeah and what do I put instead of input to say "the span parent or element #foo"
[09:03:04] <mooncup> you may be better off explaining what it is you want to achieve uskerine
[09:03:17] <robertmaxrees> you can't watch the span for a change event, you need to watch the input. either directly or through delegation.
[09:03:47] <uskerine> mmm
[09:05:50] <uskerine> I'll try to further explain
[09:05:57] <robertmaxrees> an example would be best.
[09:05:57] <uskerine> this is a checbox in my current implementation: http://pastebin.com/vsdeQjAK
[09:06:21] <uskerine> when user CHECKS the checkbox, a class CHECKED is added to the parent span
[09:06:34] <uskerine> when user leaves checkbox  UNCHECKED, that class is removed
[09:06:35] <robertmaxrees> you cannot watch for that added class - there's no event for that.
[09:06:36] <uskerine> nothing else happens
[09:06:43] <uskerine> ok
[09:06:57] <uskerine> but I am trying to understand your · $('span').on('change', 'input', function() {});
[09:07:06] <uskerine> what are the roles or 'span' and 'input' there?
[09:07:37] <robertmaxrees> that's a delegated listener.
[09:07:57] <robertmaxrees> that attaches an event listener to span and listens for changes on all descendent "inputs"
[09:08:42] <uskerine> so I should put my span and input there, right?
[09:08:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:09:00] <robertmaxrees> if you want to listen to input change events, just bind to the input.
[09:09:13] <popl> I am looking for strategies to debug something that does not work for my boss on his browser but seems to work for me here. What's a good strategy for me to debug this?
[09:09:15] <uskerine> I just want a couple of particular input's
[09:09:42] <uskerine>  $('span').on('change',  '#fooFlag', function() {} );
[09:09:43] <robertmaxrees> uskerine are they all children of a given element?  because that's a great case for event delegation.
[09:09:57] <uskerine> I have other input's which are not
[09:09:59] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to select by ID, then just bind dorectly.
[09:10:03] <popl> I'm using jquery-ui autocomplete to get suggestions from solr. It works fine for me. Both me and my boss are using Firefox 31. I'm on Linux, he's using OS X.
[09:10:20] <robertmaxrees> popl any console errors?
[09:10:25] <robertmaxrees> network issues?  etc.
[09:10:30] <uskerine> but how do I refer "the span parent of #fooFlag" in that binding?
[09:11:14] <robertmaxrees> uskerine within $(input).on('change', function() {}), you'd use $(this).closest('span');
[09:12:33] <uskerine> I will try that
[09:12:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out learn.jquery.com - you'd learn a lot :)
[09:13:31] <uskerine> understood
[09:13:38] <uskerine> I just need this
[09:13:46] <uskerine> $('#fooFlag').on('change', function(){ alert('BAZINGA'); });
[09:14:02] <robertmaxrees> okay
[09:14:03] <uskerine> but when checking for checkbox status I have to check the parent SPAN element
[09:14:08] <uskerine> thanks a lot
[09:15:08] <uskerine> and I know I'll have to do a proper review of jQuery, I just learnt it while doing an actual work
[09:15:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:15:29] <robertmaxrees> learn it while working then.
[09:15:42] <uskerine> (I code it by ear)
[09:15:50] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good ide.a
[09:15:54] <popl> robertmaxrees: two from jquery, nothing from jquery-ui: "Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead." and "Using //@ to indicate sourceMappingURL pragmas is deprecated. Use //# instead". I'm using jquery-1.9.1.min.js.
[09:16:05] <popl> I realize that's an older version of jquery
[09:16:19] <robertmaxrees> popl that shouldn't be a problem.  what about the network panel?
[09:16:21] <uskerine> I know
[09:16:26] <popl> robertmaxrees: no errors
[09:17:10] <robertmaxrees> popl do you see the request even fire to SOLR in the network panel?
[09:17:12] <popl> There's some CSS stuff but that's all coming from Mozilla
[09:17:22] <popl> robertmaxrees: I do, and I get a response.
[09:17:25] <popl> oh
[09:17:27] <popl> wait
[09:17:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:17:38] <popl> let me actually check :P
[09:17:38] <popl> sorry
[09:17:53] <popl> I had alerts and whatnot and I'm looking at the server logs on the remote server
[09:18:06] <popl> but I'll look here on the netowrk console thing
[09:18:45] <popl> I mean, obviously I'd see it because the autocomplete is working for me.
[09:18:51] <robertmaxrees> right
[09:19:48] <popl> yeah, it's doing a get to the Perl script.
[09:19:59] <popl> man, I don't know
[09:20:03] <robertmaxrees> and you're getting data returned?  i'd step through the code and see what's going on.
[09:20:21] <robertmaxrees> make sure selectors are right, that you're in the right callbacks, etc.
[09:20:58] <popl> should the response show up in the network console?
[09:21:13] <popl> it's showing results in the autocomplete menu
[09:21:25] <robertmaxrees> you said your boss is having issues - are you checking on their machine?
[09:21:30] <popl> I can't
[09:21:40] <popl> he's three timezones away
[09:21:59] <robertmaxrees> errr, can you ask them to take a look then?
[09:22:08] <robertmaxrees> kind of hard to troubleshoot an issue if you can't recreate it
[09:22:09] <popl> I notice when I do an alert that the autocomplete menu doesn't show up.
[09:22:11] <popl> I know
[09:22:19] <robertmaxrees> use console.log(), not alerts btw
[09:22:39] <popl> oh, right
[09:23:10] <popl> hey robertmaxrees, thanks for your help
[09:23:12] <popl> I appreciate it.
[09:23:18] <robertmaxrees> of course.  what we're here for :)
[09:24:16] <JohnFree> Hi guys. I've learned Javascript and jQuery. Now I want to learn AngularJS but somehow it looks very exaggerated and too overcomplicated. What's your opinion on this?
[09:24:35] <robertmaxrees> it's one of many options
[09:24:58] <robertmaxrees> i don't personally like angular.  backbone is okay.  i like riot.
[09:25:42] <JohnFree> I mean: I don't understand why it has to be so complex with MVVC-model. I mean there is PHP for doing MVC??
[09:25:54] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[09:25:58] <robertmaxrees> php is just a language.
[09:26:02] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing concepts :)
[09:26:15] <robertmaxrees> angular, backbone, riot, et al try to bring MV* to the browser.
[09:26:31] <robertmaxrees> depends on the kind of site/application you're builing.
[09:26:35] <robertmaxrees> *building
[09:27:12] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: Yes but what I mean is: jQuery is so inituitive and easy while AngularJS is overcomplicated. So I don't see the sense of learning AngularJS except some guy in this chat can convince me to use it
[09:27:25] <robertmaxrees> angular fulfills a different purpose.
[09:27:35] <robertmaxrees> jquery is all about DOM abstraction.
[09:27:40] <robertmaxrees> angular and its ilk are MV*
[09:28:44] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: So would you recommend me to use AngularJS and if yes why?
[09:29:01] <robertmaxrees> <robertmaxrees> i don't personally like angular.  backbone is okay.  i like riot.
[09:29:10] <robertmaxrees> gave you that answer ;)
[09:29:30] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: Why don't you like AngularJS?
[09:30:37] <robertmaxrees> i don't like the templates, i think it's a little heavy, and i think you can do everything it does using something a little less funky.
[09:31:00] <robertmaxrees> but it's all about personal choice :)
[09:32:04] <robertmaxrees> http://todomvc.com/ this gives you a basic overview of a lot of different frontend MV* frameworks with the same basic application
[09:34:59] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: Thanks. That sounds cool
[09:35:13] <robertmaxrees> you'll find lots of options out there.
[09:37:08] <decx> i'm implementing a god aweful retargeting script for a client
[09:37:21] <robertmaxrees> decx i just got done with some of those.
[09:37:25] <robertmaxrees> absolute yuck
[09:37:28] <decx> why not require a dozen global vars
[09:37:42] <robertmaxrees> right?!
[09:37:47] <decx> at least put that shit in a literal
[09:38:06] <decx> and not even with a pseudo namespace
[09:38:15] <decx> type, site, product_
[09:38:20] <decx> good lord
[09:38:34] <robertmaxrees> we have a lot of stuff like that in our frontend.  we cleaned up a bunch of it and our frontend error rate dropped like a rock.
[09:39:36] <decx> i will have to write double hours for torture
[09:46:37] <henggek> hi, anyone here?
[09:46:42] <robertmaxrees> a-hyup
[09:46:45] <robertmaxrees> 730 of us
[09:47:20] <henggek> I use IRC for the first time. @robertmaxrees, did you reply me?
[09:47:26] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[09:47:30] <robertmaxrees> don't use @ symbols here btw.
[09:47:33] <henggek> thanks!
[09:47:33] <robertmaxrees> this isn't twitter :)
[09:47:39] <henggek> okay :)
[09:48:52] <henggek> how do you check total number of active people here?
[09:49:10] <robertmaxrees> did you have any questions about jQuery?
[09:49:45] <henggek> I don't have any question so far
[09:50:16] <robertmaxrees> okay - if you have general questions about IRC in general, it'd probably be a good idea to look for a room about that :)
[09:50:27] <robertmaxrees> "general in general" hahahaha i am tired.
[09:50:59] <henggek> okay. thanks a lot!
[09:58:58] <blez> is there a way to capture the redirect event?
[09:59:05] <blez> for example when someone clicks on a link
[09:59:16] <robertmaxrees> you can capture the click event.
[09:59:28] <robertmaxrees> and run preventDefault() against it.
[09:59:38] <blez> no, I'm talking about making it globally
[09:59:44] <blez> like every redirect
[09:59:50] <robertmaxrees> there is no "redirect event"
[09:59:58] <robertmaxrees> you can (try to) capture all links
[10:00:04] <blez> what about: window.onbeforeunload
[10:00:14] <blez> is there some way to get the redirection url?
[10:00:17] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[10:00:21] <robertmaxrees> and that's not a redirect btw.
[10:01:14] <blez> I'm trying to make something like: when a user clicks on /help to go to localhost:1234/help for example
[10:01:44] <robertmaxrees> that's the default behavior of relative URLs.
[10:01:51] <robertmaxrees> if they're on localhost:1234
[10:02:18] <blez> but they aren't
[10:02:22] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you can setup a simple delegated listener to handle that.
[10:02:30] <blez> I want to redirect them
[10:03:08] <robertmaxrees> then do what I suggested.
[10:03:37] <blez> listener to what?
[10:03:56] <robertmaxrees> are these all links in a particular nav?
[10:04:13] <blez> they might be buttons or simple window.location.href = "/whatever";
[10:04:20] <blez> I want to be able to modify all
[10:04:47] <robertmaxrees> you need to do that in your backend if you want anything actually reliable.  otherwise, a delegated listener should do the trick
[10:09:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/hzqqpzkq/1/ you can use something like this, blez
[10:10:56] <blez> robertmaxrees I know, but I want to make it for everything, javascript redirects, buttons, <a> and so on
[10:11:11] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do what you want in any reliable mannger.
[10:11:13] <robertmaxrees> *manner
[10:11:26] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to capture the various events on the page and go from there.
[10:21:05] <decx> man what a hassle
[10:21:32] <decx> what's retargeting anyway
[10:21:55] <decx> was that identifying users across systems?
[10:22:35] <decx> xicuuu pm spams
[10:22:48] <robertmaxrees> it's the thing that makes it so when you look at products on Site A and then leave to go elsewhere, you see ads for those products/related products.
[10:23:01] <decx> i thought that was called remarketing
[10:23:12] <decx> i guess it's the same ^^
[10:23:21] <decx> right google calls it remarketing
[10:23:28] <decx> and the other one retargeting
[10:23:46] <decx> at least settle for one word
[10:23:50] <robertmaxrees> remarketing is email iirc.
[10:23:50] <decx> i suggest scam
[10:24:14] <robertmaxrees> remarketing is when you bounce and i send you an email about your abandoned cart later on.
[10:24:53] <decx> well i'm going to make my own version and call it reestablishing
[10:25:01] <uskerine> can I do this?      $('textarea[name="foo"]').on('focusout', function() {
[10:25:10] <uskerine> I would like to do something when user updates that textarea
[10:25:12] <robertmaxrees> yes, but that's a slow selector.
[10:25:18] <decx> you want change
[10:25:27] <decx> or input
[10:26:09] <uskerine>  $('textarea[name="foo"]').on('change',
[10:26:10] <uskerine> ?
[10:28:07] <uskerine> by slow you mean it would be better to use #
[10:28:07] <uskerine> ?
[10:28:37] <robertmaxrees> or .
[10:28:44] <robertmaxrees> attribute selectors are slow, basically.
[10:28:52] <uskerine> ok
[10:28:53] <uskerine> thanks
[10:28:59] <uskerine> I will use # in this case there is only one field
[10:32:30] <elmcrest> Hi again. I guess this is js related but anyhow. Can I create multiple new objects with "new Object(array)" somehow?
[10:35:09] <robertmaxrees> elmcrest you *can*, but I'd avoid it if possible.
[10:35:11] <robertmaxrees> use literals instead.
[10:35:46] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees maybe is JSON a better idea?
[10:35:59] <robertmaxrees> lol JSON isn't javascript ;) just a data format.
[10:36:02] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[10:36:42] <Tomashe> Hey guys looks like input,select").serialize(); when i run serialize on select multiple it get me nothing
[10:36:46] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees ... yeah from a json object I've ment. I try to generate a knockout observableArray from a array I get from my server
[10:36:52] <Tomashe> anyone knows why?
[10:37:09] <robertmaxrees> elmcrest i'd check out a room about knockout in that case.
[10:37:18] <robertmaxrees> Tomashe .serialize() is for forms.
[10:37:23] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees yeah you're right, thx
[10:37:53] <Tomashe> ?
[10:38:07] <Tomashe> when i run serialize on those inputs it give me the data
[10:38:16] <robertmaxrees> fiddle plz
[10:38:16] <Tomashe> input values and names
[10:51:29] <robertmaxrees> Tomashe http://jsfiddle.net/m61s77xL/
[10:59:38] <decx> fiddle slow for anyone else?
[11:04:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[12:03:52] <z1haze> hello, would someone mind helping me with datatables.js
[12:04:22] <z1haze> im using it here but all i want to do is reverse the initial click sorting from ascending to descending by default
[12:04:24] <z1haze> http://www.terminus-gaming.com/forums/mcmmo.php
[12:16:44] <z1haze> no one konws how to do this eh?
[13:19:11] <robertmaxrees> z1haze did you search their docs?
[13:19:24] <z1haze> yea
[13:19:38] <robertmaxrees> you want to default to descending instead of ascending, right?
[13:19:40] <z1haze> the only thing ive found was to set defaults for page load on a particular column or something, which i have already done
[13:20:05] <z1haze> the sorting links, when you click them, they first default to ascending, then click again to see descending
[13:20:15] <z1haze> i want that reversed. first click to be descending
[13:20:43] <robertmaxrees> http://www.datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/sorting_control.html
[13:20:49] <robertmaxrees> this page seems to have an example for it.
[13:21:01] <z1haze> been there
[13:21:04] <z1haze> nothing what im talking about
[13:21:11] <robertmaxrees> Column 3 - descending sorting, followed by ascending and then ascending again
[13:21:13] <zzz> hey guys, i have an input type="number", and i want to have a .change() to set up some manual rules to validate other fields, how would i do that, also how would i call .preventDefault() to stop the user from changing to a disallowed number
[13:21:28] <MACscr> If i have an attribute like so: data-groups=["all","available"] and I fetch those values by doing var group = $el.data("groups");, how can i test that variable if it has 'available', etc?
[13:21:52] <robertmaxrees> machty data('groups')[0]
[13:21:56] <robertmaxrees> err, MACscr
[13:22:00] <robertmaxrees> you're storing an array.
[13:22:21] <zzz> for context, it's for a 24 hour selection
[13:22:22] <robertmaxrees> z1haze if that page doesn't have what you want, you'd probably do well to hit up their forums.
[13:22:24] <MACscr> so i just need to loop through it?
[13:22:25] <z1haze> not sure thats what im looking for or if ytou understand what im sayin
[13:22:49] <robertmaxrees> z1haze this is a general support channel for jquery, not datatables.  you'll probably get better in in their forums :)
[13:22:57] <robertmaxrees> MACscr if the data is an array, yes.
[13:23:29] <robertmaxrees> zzz you can test the .val() of the given input and, if it doesn't meet your criteria, preventDefault on the event.
[13:23:54] <zzz> robertmaxrees: like .change(function(e){ // rules // e.preventDefault(); });
[13:23:54] <zzz> ?
[13:25:06] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[13:25:16] <robertmaxrees> though I don't think you want preventDefault.
[13:25:22] <robertmaxrees> err, the change event.
[13:25:22] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[13:25:33] <zzz> i just want the number to not increment/decrement if a rule blocks it
[13:25:49] <robertmaxrees> then you want the keyup event.
[13:25:52] <robertmaxrees> or keydown.
[13:26:02] <zzz> both probably
[13:26:09] <robertmaxrees> i'd do just keydown.
[13:26:14] <robertmaxrees> no need to duplicate that logic.
[13:26:27] <zzz> well, there's business rules mixed in
[13:26:37] <zzz> like end time can't be before start time
[13:26:40] <zzz> etc
[13:26:50] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't make a difference.
[13:27:12] <zzz> oh
[13:27:20] <zzz> i confused keyup/keydown
[13:27:23] <robertmaxrees> the business rules are irrelevant from the event ;)
[13:27:29] <zzz> with like numberdown/numberup
[13:27:36] <zzz> i see what you're saying
[13:27:49] <zzz> now i just need the keycodes for up and down arrows
[13:28:59] <robertmaxrees> you can also do stuff like String.fromCharCode(e.which);
[13:28:59] <zzz> and how would that work for a user clicking on the up/down arrows on the input itself?
[13:29:30] <robertmaxrees> that might be a little different in setup.
[13:29:32] <robertmaxrees> but same basic concept.
[13:29:45] <robertmaxrees> you can preventDefault() on all but a specific subset, for instance.
[13:30:03] <zzz> what event would capture the up/down arrow clicks?
[13:30:18] <robertmaxrees> next to the input?
[13:30:25] <zzz> well it's input="number"
[13:30:29] <zzz> so it's part of the same input
[13:30:32] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't matter ;)
[13:30:37] <zzz> but ya
[13:31:18] <robertmaxrees> that should be a pretty quick google search.
[13:31:48] <zzz> ah
[13:31:50] <zzz> keyup/mouseup
[13:31:56] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3940258/what-events-does-an-input-type-number-fire-when-its-value-is-changed
[13:32:32] <zzz> so i'd have to use .bind()
[13:32:54] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:32:56] <robertmaxrees> use .on()
[13:32:59] <robertmaxrees> .bind is deprecated.
[13:33:09] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: Does jQuery polyfills the 'input' event?
[13:33:31] <zzz> so .on('keyup mouseup keydown mousedown', function(e){ });
[13:33:41] <robertmaxrees> systemfault i'm... not entirely sure.  it might?
[13:34:13] <robertmaxrees> probably not, now that i think about it, but I could be wrong.
[13:38:48] <MACscr> Should i be able to do : if($.inArray( groupName, groupArray)) return true;?
[13:39:20] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle is worth a thousand words btw :)
[13:39:54] <MACscr> yes, i know
[13:40:00] <BillCriswell> MACscr: Probably want: > -1
[13:40:15] <MACscr> but im more just wantign to test if a value is in a an array and return true if it is
[13:40:54] <BillCriswell> if ($.inArray(needle, haystack) > -1) return true;
[13:41:57] <sardok> Hi everyone, i found a very common example of using jquery validator, http://jsfiddle.net/myn4K/2/. in this fiddle #contact-form submit is called even validation is failed so alert window pops up, how can i bind on submit function with validator, thanks.
[13:42:27] <BillCriswell> Would think something called "inArray" would return true or false but it returns the index of the element in the array.
[13:42:38] <MACscr> ah, thanks
[13:42:44] <MACscr> i appreciate it and that worked
[13:44:35] <robertmaxrees> sardok errr, could you clarify what you're trying to do?
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> do you want to manually call the validator?
[13:45:23] <sardok> no i want $( "#contact-form" ).submit() to be called if validation is passed, is it possible?
[13:45:33] <robertmaxrees> that's what that code does, isn't it?
[13:46:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there are a lot of examples out there that show you how to do that.
[13:46:19] <sardok> even though validation is failed, that submit function is called, for example please try pushing submit message button with leaving all fields empty, you should see alert window.
[13:47:22] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about how validator works.
[13:47:49] <sardok> yeah very likely.
[13:48:01] <robertmaxrees> did you try reading the docs first
[13:48:22] <sardok> i will do it again, thanks.
[13:59:33] <WeiJunLi> is jsfiddle working?
[13:59:40] <robertmaxrees> it's slow today.
[15:09:54] <leobalter> this t-shirt: https://cottonbureau.com/products/jquery
[15:12:42] <Technodrome> Good day
[15:12:59] <Technodrome> i have a jquery slider, vertical , just some headline tags in there
[15:13:10] <Technodrome> it slides verically with no â€œtransitionâ€ i want it to fade out
[15:13:17] <Technodrome> how should I start with this?
[15:26:19] <R13ose> how do I detect mobile devices?\
[15:26:43] <R13ose> xicuuu this person is spam
[15:28:07] <shoky> .
[15:28:36] <_r0m3> guys, do you know of any alternative to "toDataURL" for checking to see if a canvas is blank?
[15:28:53] <_r0m3> toDataURL works perfectly, except for bloody IE :/
[15:29:03] <_r0m3> ie8, i should say
[15:32:30] <snover> seeing as how ie8 does not support canvas, i am not sure how thatâ€™s a thing
[15:34:53] <_r0m3> well, i'm using canvas now -- a digital signature plugin
[15:35:31] <robertmaxrees> you can't use canvas in IE8, so I don't understand how you expect to use a canvas method in it...
[15:39:02] <_r0m3> a gravity forms plugin -- a digital signature addon, using a canvas field -- is working for me in ie8.
[15:39:23] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure they don't have an IE8 fallback that relies on VML?
[15:39:36] <_r0m3> i am not, but that's interesting.
[15:39:42] <_r0m3> i will check for that now
[15:39:58] <R13ose> any ideas on my question?
[15:40:11] <robertmaxrees> R13ose that's a generic question.  media queries can work.
[15:40:20] <robertmaxrees> you can also look at the browser's user agent.
[15:40:33] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: yes but that is for CSS.  I have code that needs to work only for desktop
[15:40:43] <robertmaxrees> R13ose then read the user agent.
[15:41:30] <_r0m3> thanks btw, robertmaxrees. as it works now, is there any alternative that you know of for checking whether or not the canvas is blank, assuming a VML fallback is being used?
[15:41:44] <robertmaxrees> _r0m3 you cannot check the canvas if it's using vml...
[15:41:48] <robertmaxrees> because you don't have a canvas.
[15:41:57] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: how do I detect non-mobile ones?
[15:42:41] <robertmaxrees> you mean detect if the user agent is for a desktop browser?
[15:42:47] <robertmaxrees> what does the JS in question do?
[15:44:38] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: yes and just detects the size of the window and resizes div to that size.
[15:45:11] <robertmaxrees> use a media query then...
[15:54:42] <_r0m3> robertmaxrees, it does appear to be using a fallback relying on VML...
[15:55:11] <_r0m3> whatever it is, is it possible to check it against being blank by javascript/jquery?
[15:55:24] <robertmaxrees> did you try searching on google for an answer?
[15:55:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:55:39] <WeiJunLi> cant load jquery in jsfiddle today?
[15:55:45] <robertmaxrees> WeiJunLi sure you can.
[15:55:54] <_r0m3> yep :) i know the routine, bud, lol
[15:56:00] <_r0m3> i'm here as a last resort
[15:56:03] <WeiJunLi> yes but seems jsfiddle have some problems today
[15:56:14] <robertmaxrees> WeiJunLi it's been up and down all day.
[15:56:38] <robertmaxrees> _r0m3 i'd have to search google and look at the spec.
[15:56:41] <WeiJunLi> something similar to jsfiddle ?
[15:56:47] <robertmaxrees> jsbin
[15:58:35] <_r0m3> i was so thrilled to have "toDataURL" working for canvas... all i'm doing is checking the canvas -- or whatever it may be in ie8 -- to see if it's blank. if it's blank, user is alerted that the field is required if they click "submit."
[15:59:00] <_r0m3> so, validation is what i'm after
[15:59:17] <robertmaxrees> okay - how can I help you with that?
[16:00:12] <_r0m3> as it stands in ie8, the field -- that you've helped me realized is not a canvas, but some kinda fallback for ie8 -- has no validation check
[16:00:26] <robertmaxrees> then change how you're validating?
[16:00:42] <robertmaxrees> i don't personally know VML, so I'd have to go read the spec.
[16:00:54] <_r0m3> that's where i'm stuck... i'm not familiar with VML :(
[16:00:57] <_r0m3> ah, i understand
[16:03:10] <WeiJunLi> someone to help me to do whta I  commented -> http://jsbin.com/vimizizaquwa/1/edit
[16:07:59] <robertmaxrees> WeiJunLi sure - what are you having difficulties with?
[16:08:08] <robertmaxrees> let's step through it together :)
[16:12:33] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:12:59] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[16:13:06] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Off today?
[16:13:09] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:13:20] <robertmaxrees> got the option to wfh though
[16:13:42] <robertmaxrees> still in the office since why not.
[16:14:31] <robertmaxrees> you?
[16:14:56] <BillCriswell> I had off (hopefully).
[16:15:02] <BillCriswell> I really need ton confirm these things.
[16:16:04] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:17:29] <WeiJunLi> robertmaxrees: I am not javascript developer,  i know some basic things. I need to click on the small pictures and the image clicked goes to the "bigImage"
[16:17:34] <WeiJunLi> with the big width and height
[16:17:48] <robertmaxrees> WeiJunLi okay - i am offering to help you learn.  i won't do it for you.
[16:23:59] <Woet> WeiJunLi: hire someone if you want someone to the job for you.
[16:25:48] <robertmaxrees> he might just be asking for help but isn't sure how to ask for it?
[16:26:50] <Woet> robertmaxrees: that's why I said "if"
[16:27:19] <robertmaxrees> kay
[16:31:31] <quansai> I've created radio buttons that are under divs, so they're styled and whatnot. I can click the div and the radio button will be selected, but when I double click the radio button div more than once, I can't select any other radio buttons. It's like my ability to click divs in the radio field set freezes. Any way to prevent this from happening? Here's the jQuery: http://pastebin.com/bnGRaGz4
[16:32:35] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prev('input') <- could you share your markup?
[16:32:43] <robertmaxrees> because what i'm envisioning and what you're doing seem... odd.
[16:32:50] <quansai> robertmaxrees: Sure.
[16:32:57] <robertmaxrees> also - there's a much easier way to do what you're looking for.
[16:33:32] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm conflating things in my head - yeah a bin or fiddle would be nice.
[16:35:03] <quansai> robertmaxrees:  http://pastebin.com/mU8amYzD
[16:35:43] <quansai> robertmaxrees: I'd fiddle this, but what you see is actually generated by Rails. Should work the same. I'm just interested in manipulating what's generated by Rails with jQuery.
[16:35:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the for attribute is supposed to match the name attribute.
[16:36:07] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you can wrap your input with the label tag.
[16:36:19] <BillCriswell> *cough* id *cough*
[16:36:32] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/pajokepupesu/1/edit
[16:36:59] <robertmaxrees> err yeah the id.
[16:37:03] <robertmaxrees> i usually just wrap it.
[16:37:13] <robertmaxrees> wow bad markup hurr i'
[16:37:57] <quansai> robertmaxrees: Isn't it advised I don't use .attr()? To use .prop() instead?
[16:38:14] <robertmaxrees> quansai yes, but you don't need it at all in this case.
[16:38:42] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/pajokepupesu/1/edit
[16:38:46] <robertmaxrees> raw html, no js necessary.
[16:41:04] <quansai> robertmaxrees: What's terribly funny is that in my original code, I'm just using pure html/css. All I want to do is use a div for selection instead of the default radio button. But when I port my pure html/css code to the Rails code, it doesn't work.
[16:41:20] <quansai> robertmaxrees: Hence, I'm using a jQuery alternative. It doesn't make sense to me.
[16:41:22] <robertmaxrees> then your rails stuff is broken?
[16:41:29] <robertmaxrees> don't use the jquery version.
[16:41:35] <robertmaxrees> figure out why rails is being cranky.
[16:42:10] <quansai> robertmaxrees: I would love to figure that out, but I didn't write the code I'm writing on top of, and I'm pressed for time. I'm also very new to Rails.
[16:42:52] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* okay - setup a bind.
[16:42:57] <robertmaxrees> *bin.  or fiddle.
[16:44:53] <quansai> robertmaxrees: All I want to do is 1) Hide the radio button; 2) Show a div in place of the radio button; 3) Change the style of the div when the radio button is clicked.  I have a set of choices for each set of choices. Each choice has a different 'id'.
[16:47:18] <robertmaxrees> there are a few different ways to accomplish that.  is there any reason your for attributes don't match the related IDs?
[16:47:49] <quansai> robertmaxrees: What do you mean?
[16:48:13] <robertmaxrees> your labels all have for attributes on them.  you generally use that to tie a label back to an input.
[16:48:41] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/pajokepupesu/2/edit
[16:48:58] <robertmaxrees> so you can do this, and then bind an event listener to those input's "change" event to do your div magic.
[16:51:42] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/pajokepupesu/3/edit
[16:54:30] <quansai> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[16:57:47] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[16:58:31] <uskerine> instead of .val(), what should I use to get the content of a <h3> and <span> elements?
[16:58:38] <robertmaxrees> .text()
[16:58:38] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: usually nicer
[16:58:40] <uskerine> thanks
[16:58:45] <robertmaxrees> .val() is for inputs only.
[17:08:29] <onenine90> I have recently started including all my javascript for my app at the bottom of the HTML doc in one big js file. Can someone plz help me understand how to do this properly? For example, on the product page, the javascript is trying to fire events that should only be happening on the cart page
[17:08:38] <onenine90> How can I tell javascipt what page it is, and when to activate certain parts of the script? if that make sense
[17:08:44] <onenine90> Do I need to look at the URL with javascript?
[17:09:32] <Nomikos> document.location is a useful object
[17:11:26] <uskerine> I use a hidden field with the page name
[17:11:35] <uskerine> not sure if elegant but it works
[17:12:22] <MACscr> Hmm, any suggestions on what I might be doing wrong here that is causing my shuffle elements to not correctly align for the 'Unavailable filter'? Type in a keyword, hit search, then hit the unavailable filter. http://tinyurl.com/nbo6oku
[17:15:33] <Nomikos> Javascript can get at pretty much all the elements of the url
[17:15:45] <uskerine> the url might change
[17:16:25] <Nomikos> well. then the JS will re-execute, won't it?
[17:17:04] <Nomikos> even for the hash-bits, I'm pretty sure document.location will keep up
[17:17:33] <uskerine> I mean for doing the 'if's and so, if I understood onenine90 wanted to execute certain parts of the code depending on the particular page
[17:17:49] <uskerine> you code myFoo1.html but later you decide to do it seo-compliant-whatever.html
[17:17:57] <uskerine> with a hidden field you stillname it MYFOOPAGE
[17:18:12] <uskerine> but it is a personal preference, not sure if it is the best way of doing it
[17:18:42] <Nomikos> ah, yeah it depends on the usecase
[17:19:26] <adamsilver> I want to access and change "No data" here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vtl6xvpo8f40dod/Screenshot%202014-09-01%2020.17.20.png?dl=0 â€¦ why this is not working $('#pie_chart_div').('div').('div').('svg').('text').val('aaaaa');
[17:19:45] * drej blinks
[17:22:50] <Nomikos> adamsilver: close, but x.('div') is not correct JS syntax
[17:23:06] <Nomikos> () only works with function calls like find()
[17:23:36] <Nomikos> that said, maybe there's a quicker way to get at it
[17:23:57] <adamsilver> Nomikos: like how? it doesn't have id or name
[17:24:57] <Nomikos> if there is always an svg inside the #pie_chart_div and it always has one single <text> item, you could do $('#pie_chart_div svg text').text('aaaaa')
[17:25:08] <b-ot> Nomikos: No output.
[17:25:17] * Nomikos pats b-ot 
[17:25:59] <Nomikos> I'm not sure how svg and text elements behave, but afaik val() only works on input elements
[17:26:09] <Nomikos> and maybe select, sort of thing
[17:26:50] <quansai> When I click one radio button, then click another, then try to click the first one I clicked, I can't click that first one. It doesn't get selected. wtf
[17:26:56] <adamsilver> Nomikos: that actually worked, thank you
[17:26:59] <Technodrome> i need help with some transitions of this jquery slideshow
[17:27:04] <Technodrome> anyone here ever do this sort of stuff?
[17:27:05] <Nomikos> adamsilver: most welcome
[17:27:22] <Nomikos> quansai: jsfiddle?
[17:31:02] <quansai> Nomikos: http://pastebin.com/sX6iZBre <-- See what I'm dealing with? I know it's not a fiddle.
[17:31:20] <robertmaxrees> didn't i give you what you wanted a second ago?
[17:31:39] <robertmaxrees> also, grouping those with divs or something might make it a little easier :)
[17:31:52] <quansai> robertmaxrees: It wasn't what I wanted, apparently.
[17:31:56] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[17:31:59] <quansai> robertmaxrees: hmm
[17:32:13] <robertmaxrees> why not update the bin i shot out?  i am confused.
[17:32:49] <quansai> PM for an example of what I'm trying to do
[17:33:04] <robertmaxrees> we generally ask that you don't PM.
[17:33:48] <Nomikos> hrmph, jsfiddle having issues
[17:33:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah, jsbin is up though.
[17:35:06] <Nomikos> does this work? http://jsbin.com/yebobezisalo/1/
[17:35:40] <Nomikos> I notice the labels aren't working
[17:36:03] <Nomikos> .. I shouldn't even be awake tbh
[17:36:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/pajokepupesu/3/edit was what i came up with.
[17:36:15] <robertmaxrees> not even sure when this falls apart.
[17:39:00] <robertmaxrees> haha my boss told me to finish up from home if I wanted.  "beer in hand rule applies"
[18:00:34] <uskerine> which is the right size for a favicon? -a bit offtopic but for sure you deal with that too-
[18:00:58] <robertmaxrees> kind of a loaded question - which device?
[18:01:08] <robertmaxrees> and browser?
[18:01:20] <uskerine> any and any
[18:01:40] <uskerine> well for device, mostly desktops and tablets
[18:01:43] <robertmaxrees> !g favicon dimensions
[18:01:44] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: html - Favicon dimensions? - Stack Overflow â†’ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2268204/favicon-dimensions
[18:02:17] <uskerine> is it safe to use 32x32 instead of 16x16?
[18:02:51] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/23232017/923919
[18:02:57] <uskerine> as I read in the url actually ico can contain 16,32 and 48 pixels versions
[18:03:08] <robertmaxrees> depends who you are talking about.
[18:03:46] <uskerine> I see
[18:04:07] <uskerine> thanks for the links, they help
[18:06:29] <robertmaxrees> just a google search or two ;)
[18:11:57] <MACscr> hmm, i have a few functions and jquery plugin initialize (ts one of those gird shuffle plugins) when a form is submitted. The problem is that if i submit again, it doesnt appear the shuffle plugin is reset.
[18:13:51] <MACscr> im guessing i need to find a way for the plugin to reset itself? Right now im just reseting the #results div by using empty() on it
[18:14:11] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[18:15:27] <MACscr> grr, the docs on this plugin arent that great. I probably should have used something else
[18:15:34] <robertmaxrees> what plugin?
[18:15:41] <MACscr> shuffle.js
[18:16:00] <MACscr> only one that seemed simple, could be used for a commercial site, and didnt have documented bootstrap conflicts
[18:16:31] <MACscr> http://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/
[18:17:03] <robertmaxrees> you'd probably have to kill everything and reinitialize
[18:17:33] <MACscr> is there a generic way to do that or am i at the plugins mercy?
[18:18:18] <robertmaxrees> delete the content, re-add it, and initialize the plugin again?
[18:18:52] <MACscr> i am kind of already doing that. hmm
[18:19:14] <robertmaxrees> you could dump through the docs or dig through the source.
[18:19:17] <robertmaxrees> see what you could do.
[18:19:22] <robertmaxrees> or change to another plugin/
[18:23:07] <pheas> for jquery ui auto complete do u notice that its to slow? even putting it at delay: 0
[18:23:36] <robertmaxrees> pheas are you serving content up via ajax?
[18:24:46] <pheas> no php, but its local.
[18:25:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:25:23] <robertmaxrees> are you using content on the page or hitting your server for the results?
[18:25:55] <pheas> getting the server for results
[18:26:07] <robertmaxrees> that's using ajax.
[18:26:14] <robertmaxrees> and that might be part of why it's slow.
[18:26:20] <jeffreylevesque> how do i apply 'on' event to an array of input elements
[18:26:22] <jeffreylevesque> i was trying `$('input[name="svm_dataset[]"]').on('input change', function() { // code...}` but that only works on the first element from the form array
[18:26:44] <robertmaxrees> that selector should work.
[18:27:02] <robertmaxrees> oh
[18:27:03] <robertmaxrees> hah
[18:27:17] <robertmaxrees> might need to escape those extra square brackets.
[18:27:43] <robertmaxrees> $('input[name="svm_dataset\[\]"]') or something
[18:28:19] <robertmaxrees> do the extra elements exist on pageload?
[18:28:25] <jeffreylevesque> yes sir
[18:28:34] <robertmaxrees> then no idea without an example.
[18:29:06] <robertmaxrees> that selector will match all elements that are <input name="svm_dataset[]>
[18:29:14] <robertmaxrees> extra quote in ther obvious.
[18:29:16] <robertmaxrees> *there
[18:31:02] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go.
[18:31:04] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.

[19:51:45] <ruibrito> hey i need some help loading script dynamically, the $.getscript is not working
[19:51:49] <ruibrito> anymody can help?
[19:51:56] <ruibrito> *anybody
[20:34:33] <ruibritopt> hi, i need some help loading script dynamically, can anybody help?
[21:55:39] <BclaP> Hello all. Is there a way to unbind an event on a specific element ( <li> ) that is a descendant of a delegated event?
[21:55:57] <MACscr> im using bootstrap 3 and of course jquery. Any recommendations for making a textarea the full height and width of the content it contains? im using $('#csr').html(data); to populate it
[21:56:35] <MACscr> BclaP: find(''li) ?
[21:56:45] <MACscr> er, find('li')
[21:57:07] <avi__> MACscr: textareas have cols and rows, if you split the text by lines you have the rows. Then if you find the max length of all those lines you have columns.
[21:57:29] <BclaP> MACscr: should I just paste the code?
[21:57:51] <MACscr> avi__: great point
[21:58:19] <avi__> MACscr: consider using the raw text before htmlifying (entity markup)
[21:58:35] <MACscr> not sure i follow
[21:58:47] <avi__> &entity;
[21:58:57] <avi__> that is 1 char wide will not count as 1 char wide given string length
[21:59:22] <BclaP> http://jsbin.com/hahipovotazi/1/edit
[21:59:32] <avi__> MACscr: for instance the string length of "<" versus "&lt;" are different yet displayed at the same width
[21:59:47] <MACscr> avi__: the content is a a csr and a private key, so pretty predictable content
[21:59:52] <BclaP> Sometimes I wonder if I should even be using an object literal for all of this...
[22:00:04] <avi__> MACscr: ah you're pretty safe then
[22:01:36] <BclaP> You can see in the code that the events bound to .mainCategory bubble to #categoryList
[22:02:20] <BclaP> but I want to unbind each .mainCategory li after it is clicked
[22:02:39] <BclaP> and then rebind it to toggle the data that is dynamically inserted via the API
[22:03:17] <BclaP> my question is: how do you unbind that specific <li> if the event is delegated to the #categoryList <ul> ?
[22:04:57] <BclaP> I know you have to use off, but how?
[22:07:46] <MACscr> why do you have zero js there?
[22:09:36] <donnie> hi
[22:09:59] <donnie> can i change ->first() into ->last() in eloquent?
[22:38:09] <BclaP> MACscr: should there be more than zero js there?
[22:38:37] <MACscr> BclaP: you are asking a javascript question and you have no javascript there
[22:39:49] <BclaP> i'm asking a jquery question and it's all jquery
[22:40:01] <MACscr> there is no jquery in your example
[22:40:08] <BclaP> lol
[22:40:27] <MACscr> oh, lol, you put the js in your html, wth
[22:40:47] <MACscr> thats not how you use that tool....
[22:41:01] <BclaP> oooooh you mean the pastebin itself
[22:41:07] <MACscr> your css doesnt go into your css tab either
[22:41:18] <MACscr> um, thats not a pastebin tool. Thats not its purpose
[22:41:48] <BclaP> i might as well make a jsfiddle
[22:41:50] <BclaP> give me one minute
[22:42:08] <MACscr> thats what jsbin is for. its just an alternative to jsfiddle. but yes, i prefer jsfiddle
[22:43:49] <BclaP> MACscr: http://jsfiddle.net/vee281oy/
[22:44:15] <BclaP> although the actual <li> items I speak of are being added via the ajax call
[22:45:26] <MACscr> so were not really going to be able to help unless you have some test data
[22:45:53] <BclaP> k one sec
[22:46:06] <MACscr> if you could clean up your js formatting, that owuld help people too
[22:46:10] <MACscr> hard to read your code
[22:47:15] <MACscr> you also forgot to load jquery in that fiddle
[22:47:31] <MACscr> please help yourself so we can help you
[22:48:10] <BclaP> i agree with all your points except the formatting
[22:48:21] <BclaP> my formatting is consistent
[22:49:26] <BclaP> unless, of course, you mean there is a commonly used one that I'm not using
[22:49:39] <BclaP> in which case you are correct
