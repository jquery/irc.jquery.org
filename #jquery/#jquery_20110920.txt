[00:01:14] <hyfather> i meant jQ UI version 1.8.14
[00:01:15] <KicStart1> are you setting percentages and not the actual %100 image sz?
[00:04:13] <red> I've tested actual px values and percentages
[00:04:24] <red> The iframe lets the image overflow over the bottom, and over the right side
[00:04:50] <red> but trying to adjust the modals position towards topleft fails
[00:05:03] <red> The edge of iframe cuts the image from top & left borders
[00:05:25] <red> Been trying to move it around with inspector, setting z-indices etc. to no avail
[00:05:45] <red> I'm just feeling that somehow I need to fool Colorbox to open in the iframes parent (the real website)
[00:06:03] <red> ..if that's even possible since the data is inside the iframe
[00:08:30] <red> Guess I could just add a title <a> to the images, where the user can open it via target blank to see the actual full resolution
[00:08:43] <red> Subpar but I'm running out of ideas :|
[00:26:29] <dabb_> hi all, question: is there an easy way to select the cell left from the current (clicked) cell?
[00:27:33] <nail_> dabb_: .prev()
[00:27:34] <dabb_> this doesnt work: $( "td", $(this).parent() ).eq(0).html()
[00:27:50] <ServerSage> dabb_: .prev('td')
[00:29:20] <dabb_> hm, does not work
[00:29:34] <Mafia> i'm having trouble matching smileys with regex. example: :-| :-) :) :( :-(
[00:29:56] <stede> hi all. why .length return 0 even there is one matching element? i can manipulate that element with the same selector i use with length ?!
[00:30:01] <dabb_> $(".tblMove").dblclick(function() { table = $(this).prev("td").html(); alert( table ); });
[00:30:09] <dabb_> is more or less the complete thing
[00:30:19] <dabb_> and the table itself lokks like:
[00:30:29] <dabb_> Table       Move
[00:30:35] <dabb_> BlaBla     >>
[00:30:41] <dabb_> Smth      >>
[00:30:58] <Mafia> I'm injecting a js file after a page loads .. which goes through all elements with class name "messageBody" and converts the smileys in them to <img> tags
[00:31:11] <dabb_> so when i dblclick on the >>, the html of the first cell show be taken via jq
[00:33:31] <Mafia> $('.messageBody).each(function(){ $(this).replace("/(.*)\b:|(.*)/g",'<img src="http://xyz.com');
[00:35:05] <Spadeski> Do any of you know how to use the draggable plugin that comes with jquery
[00:42:56] <mekwall> Spadeski: if you're talking about the jquery ui draggable, then yes... $("div.draggable").draggalbe();
[00:43:38] <Spadeski> mekwall its a big problem as far as I can see no one else knows how even though its totally easy so mind if i PM
[00:43:40] <Spadeski> ?
[00:46:45] <mekwall> Spadeski: why PM? just write in here
[00:47:42] <Spadeski> ?
[00:53:00] <Spadeski> http://www.dhtmlgoodies.com/scripts/arrange-table-rows/demo.html mekwall that is the example im working on I would like too send the order the list is in to mysql and refresh it without refreshing
[00:54:17] <mekwall> Spadeski: refresh it without refreshing? amazingly paradoxal :)
[00:54:41] <mekwall> Spadeski: I get what you mean though...
[00:55:04] <mekwall> Spadeski: but why are you messing about with droppable?
[00:55:11] <mekwall> draggable even*
[00:56:16] <Spadeski> My site ive been learning all the languages so I can start a T-shirt company maybe social network even there is no point but hey why not but ive learned most of them and workin with jquery to get a new top friends module upgraded from your facebook website
[00:56:30] <Spadeski> as well as the chat im working on will make theres look like shit
[00:56:34] <Spadeski> lol
[00:57:12] <red> http://jsfiddle.net/ZZH6G/ -- I use this to initiate colorbox, the custom title I set can be found with inspector but the div is set to "display: none;" for some reason - anyone know what I might be doing wrong?
[00:57:50] <Spadeski> red I also have a question is there a way too get the color of any pixel on the screen by mousetip ?
[00:58:33] <red> There are browser extensions for that at least
[00:58:46] <Spadeski> hmm kelw
[00:58:49] <red> But a Jquery specific implementations I don't know of
[00:59:07] <red> google for color picker extension and your browsername :)
[00:59:28] <Spadeski> I am but im thinking how to make it for all brwoser
[00:59:33] <red> I use "chrome Eye Dropper"
[00:59:39] <red> ah
[00:59:54] <red> hard to say :)
[01:00:40] <Meetoman> hey guys
[01:00:59] <Spadeski> mekwall ?
[01:01:14] <Spadeski> Why do you ask ?
[01:05:30] <red> I tried jQuery().bind('cbox_complete', function(){ jQuery("#cboxTitle").show(); }); -- but it doesn't seem to help either
[01:07:11] <mekwall> Spadeski: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/9zsXa/show/
[01:07:49] <xec> red: why do you have the parens after jQuery at the beginning there
[01:07:54] <Spadeski> mekwall Checking it ourt
[01:08:04] <Spadeski> out
[01:08:05] <mekwall> Spadeski: look in the console when you click the button
[01:08:13] <xec> red: try jQuery.bind(...)
[01:08:25] <xec> no nevermind
[01:08:32] <Spadeski>  mekwall What is JsFiddle ?
[01:08:32] <xec> i just woke up :P
[01:08:39] <red> xec: isn't it the same as jQuery(document).bind('cbox_complete', function(){
[01:08:46] <mekwall> Spadeski: a good tool for creating test cases
[01:08:55] <mekwall> Spadeski: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/9zsXa/
[01:09:08] <red> whoa
[01:09:11] <red> apparrently it wasn't the same
[01:09:14] <red> thanks :)
[01:09:15] <xec> red: not sure what an empty parens would do
[01:11:05] <red> nothing apparently
[01:11:14] <red> no error, but didnt do anything heh
[01:11:29] <red> with the latter line it worked like a charm
[01:12:02] <xec> goodie, glad to help even if i am off my game :D
[01:12:15] <mekwall> xec: an empty parens creates an empty jQuery object
[01:12:19] <mekwall> red as well
[01:13:33] <mekwall> xec, red: it was one of the changes introduced in jQuery 1.4
[01:13:46] <red> i see
[01:14:01] <red> example code I was building from was from Sep 2009
[01:14:04] <red> makes sense :)
[01:14:09] <Spadeski> mekwall which console
[01:14:26] <mekwall> red: use $(function(){ /../ }); or jQuery(function(){ / .. / });
[01:14:40] <mekwall> Spadeski: wtf... you don't even know what the console is?
[01:14:46] <mekwall> jeebus :(
[01:15:27] <mekwall> Spadeski: in IE, press F12 ... in FF install Firebug .. in Chrome press ctrl+shift+i
[01:15:47] <xec> mekwall: cheers
[01:16:03] <Spadeski> mekwall yeah im back in times still on dialup actually
[01:16:17] <mekwall> woah
[01:16:20] <mekwall> stoneage :)
[01:17:11] <mekwall> Spadeski: well you got alot to learn :)
[01:17:25] <Spadeski> Definetely but I think im at a very good start :D
[01:17:27] <mekwall> Spadeski: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[01:17:40] <Spadeski> Would you like too see my website mekwall
[01:17:53] <mekwall> nah im fine thanks :P bit busy here
[01:18:20] <Spadeski> Alright then
[01:19:38] <mekwall> I bet coldhead want to take a peek though
[01:19:42] <Spadeski>  mekwall make it alert instead or return thats what got me but other that was perfect
[01:19:51] <Spadeski> I'm sure he has
[01:20:06] <mekwall> Spadeski: dont use alert()
[01:20:12] <mekwall> Spadeski: use console.log :)
[01:20:18] <mekwall> that will print out to the console
[01:20:21] <mrHat> ok, so i have a thumbnail photo gallery and doing some animation on hover and hover out. for some reason sometimes if i click a thumb while the animation still plays or click exactly when the animation finishes ... the click wont work.. i have to click again to start the on click bind that i gave. Why?
[01:20:27] <Spadeski> hmm alright
[01:21:12] <xec> mrHat: show us your code?
[01:21:41] <mrHat> hmmm
[01:21:45] <mrHat> its lots of code
[01:22:04] <mrHat> basically the click event its from colobox (if you know it)
[01:22:14] <mrHat> its a lightbox variation
[01:22:17] <xec> hove animation and a click event shouldnt be "loads" of code?
[01:22:20] <xec> hover*
[01:22:36] <mrHat> xec then why asking for the code :)
[01:22:48] <xec> mrHat: to see what you have done
[01:22:52] <mrHat> just a sec
[01:23:04] <xec> mrHat: could you make a working demo in jsfiddle perhaps
[01:23:29] <mrHat> pfff
[01:38:33] <Ankabout> can anyone help me adjusting this script so it shuffles from string to string, rather than shuffling out of nothing?
[01:38:34] <Ankabout> http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/shuffle-letters-effect-jquery/
[01:45:43] <mekwall> Ankabout: que?
[01:47:34] <Ankabout> mekwall, well right now the script makes a string shuffle into existence by the letters randomly suffling
[01:47:50] <Ankabout> so instead of it going out of nothing, I want one string to start shuffling, and turn into another string
[01:48:08] <shomon> hi, is there a function or technique to change the color of a menu item, for the last clicked button, if that button has an onclick that changes an iframe in another div? How can I get only the "current" iframe button be highlighted?
[01:48:15] <xec> Ankabout: http://jsfiddle.net/4am9g/ ?
[01:48:48] <mekwall> Ankabout: ah, now I get it
[01:49:05] <xec> just for the record i didn't change the plugin :P
[01:49:50] <xec> but yea i see what you mean, it removes "from string" before shuffling
[01:50:05] <mekwall> xec: that doesn't do what he wants :)
[01:50:12] <mekwall> exactly :D
[01:50:20] <Ankabout> xec, exactly
[01:50:42] <Ankabout> from strong should shuffle into to string
[01:57:43] <Ankabout> ok, maybe I can live with this for now...
[01:58:12] <Ankabout> xec, can you see how I can remove numbers, so only letters come? I can remove symbols by removing the types [i] = symbol
[01:58:17] <Ankabout> but I can't see the numbers part
[02:00:43] <Ankabout> oh wait, I was wrong, fount it
[02:00:47] <Ankabout> found*
[02:07:44] <mrHat> ok so finally can anyone tell me why i got the problem with the click when hovering ?
[02:08:11] <hExDJ> I have a radio button group, I wanna know if the first one is selected (the value varies so I can't use that)
[02:08:17] <hExDJ> is there a way to do this?
[02:10:25] <mrHat> hExDJ you need to loop
[02:10:45] <hExDJ> mrHat: how do u mean?
[02:10:53] <mrHat> oh no
[02:10:54] <kh4n> why loop
[02:10:58] <mrHat> you only need the 1st value ?
[02:10:59] <shomon> how do I make a typical menu? When clicked, a button changes colour. when the next menu item is clicked, that button changes back, and the next button changes colour
[02:11:14] <shomon> can that be done easily?
[02:11:18] <kh4n> $('#containter input[type="radio"]:first') ?
[02:11:19] <hExDJ> I don't need the value, I need to know which one is selected
[02:11:29] <hExDJ> kh4n: will give it a try
[02:11:40] <kh4n> hExDJ: well the selected one is that which returns value
[02:11:54] <mrHat> http://iphonexpert.es/tudor/photo.html
[02:11:58] <mrHat> kh4n
[02:12:12] <mrHat> just hover over and try to click exactly when the animation stops
[02:12:12] <hExDJ> hmmm so if I have 4 radio buttons I cannot know which one is selected, correct?
[02:12:27] <mrHat> the click event wont trigger
[02:12:52] <kh4n> mrHat: i see it
[02:13:06] <mrHat> what can be it
[02:13:44] <kh4n> sec
[02:13:50] <mrHat> k
[02:14:38] <kh4n> mrHat: i would say that the colorbox has some kinde of timeout after the hover
[02:14:49] <mrHat> i tried taking that out
[02:15:14] <mrHat> and just make a onclick("alert('something')") and i get the same
[02:15:21] <kh4n> to be honest, i'm not very familiar with the colorbox
[02:15:31] <mrHat> but it's not about colorbox :)
[02:15:43] <mrHat> a simple onclick("alert('something')") on the anchors does the same
[02:15:43] <kh4n> well the color box is triggering the transition
[02:16:00] <kh4n> so it's possible it catches all your clicks
[02:16:10] <mrHat> http://iphonexpert.es/tudor/files/main.js
[02:16:19] <mrHat> $("a[rel='photo']").colorbox.... i took this out
[02:16:26] <mrHat> and same things happens
[02:16:37] <mrHat> if colorbox its not initialized it has nothing to do with it
[02:16:48] <beasty> sean` :)
[02:17:17] <kh4n> mrHat: also, it's possible that the click event is trigered right before .stop()
[02:17:31] <kh4n> mrHat: although, it seems very unlikely
[02:17:48] <mrHat> damn it
[02:17:57] <mrHat> has something to do with the fadeTo()
[02:18:03] <kh4n> i would say so
[02:18:10] <Ankabout> I have 2 questions about this fiddle I set up: http://jsfiddle.net/4am9g/6/
[02:18:22] <Ankabout> first is how I can fill an array with the contents of the "item" elements
[02:18:35] <Ankabout> second is how I can loop the function through those array items
[02:19:18] <kh4n> array.push(data)
[02:19:29] <mrHat> kh4n : so you have no ideea how to debug this
[02:19:33] <kh4n> 2/ for var item in array { }
[02:19:48] <kh4n> mrHat: no, not really, i'm sorry
[02:19:53] <mrHat> k
[02:19:55] <mrHat> tnx anyway
[02:20:02] <kh4n> well, you're welcome
[02:20:07] <kh4n> i would look on those callbacks
[02:20:13] <kh4n> seems like one is preventing other to happen
[02:20:40] <kh4n> i would love to look deeply on this, but i'm @work so there's not much time for this u know
[02:27:18] <mekwall> Ankabout: I'm working on ze shufflin
[02:27:27] <Ankabout> thanks mekwall!
[02:27:48] * Ankabout passes mekwall a beer for motivation
[02:28:59] <mekwall> Ankabout: as long as jsfiddle wants to play with me... its really unstable these days :(
[02:43:44] <AdTaylor> Hi, I was wondering where local variable are defined in jQuery document ready? Or more acuratley, where can they  — if they can — be accessed? I've knocked up a fiddle to explain what I mean more clearly http://jsfiddle.net/8KYHb/
[02:45:19] <discorpia> AdTaylor: your problem there is that App is a variable created in the context of ready()
[02:45:56] <discorpia> AdTaylor: you should put  var app; outside the jquery ready() and then inside just do  app = new MyApp();
[02:46:01] <AdTaylor> member:discorpia : Therefore inaccessible?
[02:46:13] <AdTaylor> ahhhhh
[02:46:33] <AdTaylor> member:discorpia, thanks for that — I knew it would be embarrassingly simple!!
[02:46:39] <discorpia> adtaylor: http://jsfiddle.net/8KYHb/1/
[02:46:42] <discorpia> AdTaylor: np, you're welcome
[02:57:05] <mekwall> Ankabout: I give up... jsfiddle is just a mess atm and I lost my code and dont want to redo it all
[02:57:20] <Ankabout> mekwall, thanks for trying anyways!
[02:58:11] <mekwall> Ankabout: np... but that plugin will need a full rewrite more or less
[02:58:32] <Ankabout> what about just using it like xec made it, but then going through a loop
[02:58:36] <Ankabout> that should be easy right?
[03:00:44] <seutje> mekwall: ever tried using it on a phone?
[03:01:02] <mekwall> seutje: using what?
[03:01:10] <seutje> mekwall: jsfiddle
[03:01:17] <mekwall> seutje: nope
[03:01:25] <seutje> mekwall: don't
[03:01:31] <mekwall> seutje: haha ok
[03:01:33] <seutje> u'll give up anyway
[03:01:35] <mekwall> noted
[03:01:48] <mekwall> need to finish testcake.net :)
[03:01:56] <mekwall> alphatastic atm
[03:07:53] <curufin> hi i have an issue about jquery (and chrome). im initializing a div element with create element and wanted to add an effect with $(mydiv).hover(func1, func2). func does "$(mydiv).animate({'height': 0, 300, 'easeout}) now i get several errors. in chrome: "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'easeout' - Google-Suche" in ff mydiv has no attribute "easeout".
[03:08:04] <curufin> any suggestions what im doing wrong?
[03:11:55] <red> mmh, can I access a JS variable created inside an iframe from outside, or a JS variable created outside an iframe inside it?
[03:12:48] <red> curufin: I believe easeout is an animation effect from the jQuery UI library, are you using it as well?
[03:13:12] <red> if not, you must contend with http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/
[03:18:29] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[03:18:40] <ruby_on_tails> i want to catch the input which has focus on a click event
[03:18:48] <ruby_on_tails> but the problem is the click even unregisters the focus
[03:19:37] <discorpia> ruby_on_tails: you could store the latest input element that got focus in a variable that you can read later
[03:20:27] <ruby_on_tails> discorpia: basically i have a list of texts, when its clicked it should be insered in the active input text/textarea
[03:22:11] <aaronmcadam> muzone did u sort out ur map?
[03:22:31] <ruby_on_tails> discorpia: i dont want to apply a js that will trigger on every js
[03:22:34] <ruby_on_tails> on every focus*
[03:22:39] <aaronmcadam> pretty sure the google logo must be included according to their terms of use
[03:22:47] <discorpia> ruby_on_tails: i think you can do that several ways. preventing the default event might solve it as well. but you could for example let all the text elements .focus(function(){ latestTextFocus = $(this).attr('id'); } and then use .click() { $('#'+latestTextFocus).val(......); }
[03:22:53] <ruby_on_tails> i was thinking about if i could catch the element getting blurred on the text-click
[03:23:18] <aaronmcadam> onblur event
[03:23:29] <ruby_on_tails> discorpia: i am using return false on the text click, but that still moves the focus out of the input
[03:23:44] <ruby_on_tails> aaronmcadam: again that would mean i applied an event that would trigger on every blur
[03:23:46] <discorpia> ruby_on_tails: return false is not the way to do it though, use e.preventDefault();
[03:23:51] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[03:24:07] <aaronmcadam> you might need see ?stopProgapagtion too
[03:24:09] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Couldn't find "stopProgapagtion" in jQuery Docs.
[03:24:16] <discorpia> ruby_on_tails: you can try to see if the old element is still focused if you use .mousedown() instead of .click()
[03:24:17] <aaronmcadam> you might need see ?stopPropagation too
[03:24:17] <bot-t> event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[03:24:46] <ruby_on_tails> e.preventdefault doesnt work
[03:24:50] <ruby_on_tails> mousedown does work :D
[03:24:52] <ruby_on_tails> cool, thanks
[03:25:02] <discorpia> np
[03:25:09] <aaronmcadam> there's also focusin/focusout too
[03:27:04] <Mafia> can anyone please explain why this is happening http://jsfiddle.net/bikerabhinav/VZ5AC/ (click on the Output box to see changes)
[03:27:53] <Mafia> idea is to replace all smiley codes with images
[03:28:17] <Mafia> and they should stay like that afterwards
[03:28:53] <ruby_on_tails> discorpia: http://jsfiddle.net/Pd3Ms/3/ could you tell why this doesnt work if i remove the alert at #4 ?
[03:29:03] <ruby_on_tails> http://jsfiddle.net/Pd3Ms/4/ < alert removed
[03:29:13] <ruby_on_tails> it refreshes the page, why ?
[03:29:32] <red> Can I access JS variables created in the original webpage, with "var a = 1;" from inside an iframe (thats in same domain)? I read that console.log(window.parent.document.a); should work but I'm getting "undefined"
[03:32:44] <scribe> Hey guys.  I have a fairly basic question I was hoping someone might help me with.  I am retrieving a webpage with an XMLHTTPRequest and finding a div inside the response and trying to inject that div into my current page.  I'm sure I am doing something basic wrong.  I have 2 alerts in my page.  The first alert shows me the response, which correct shows the full html of the page I requested.  The second alert shows me $(response).find('#con
[03:32:45] <scribe> tent'), which shows me [object Object].  I don't want [object Object], but instead the text.  How do I dereference the object?
[03:32:50] <scribe> http://pastebin.com/teW9MdG6
[03:33:09] <HardPhuck> what would be the best way to test which way (up or down) a user is scrolling within scroll function?
[03:33:49] <discorpia> ruby_on_tails: hmm, it seems the preventDefault() isn't triggering correctly/still lets the click go through to the link
[03:34:07] <discorpia> ruby_on_tails: maybe you need to add e.preventDefault() to .click() also
[03:34:42] <discorpia> ruby_on_tails: http://jsfiddle.net/Pd3Ms/5/ seems to work
[03:41:12] <ruby_on_tails> discorpia: cool thanks
[03:52:38] <squeakytoy> Hey all. I am in a weird (complicated) situation. I am doing jquery.position on an element that is floated right, but position is giving me way too low coordinates (like if it wasn't positioned right). Can anyone think of why jquery.position doesn't return the correct coordinates?
[03:53:21] <aaronmcadam> maybe because there's no position style on a floated element?
[03:53:44] <aaronmcadam> you might be looking for scrollTop or something similar
[03:53:49] <squeakytoy> its float right with help of a css class
[03:54:04] <aaronmcadam> yeah that's not a position rule is it
[03:54:39] <aaronmcadam> what does offset return?

[03:55:51] <aaronmcadam> you should fiddle demos
[03:56:21] <squeakytoy> I am just thinking. How does exactly position/offset work? Is it possible to manipulate some variable of the element, so jquery.position/offset can give an incorrect result?

[03:58:29] <kbotnen> hi. How can I select a object thats inside another element? I have a some list items, which contains objects (generated by jquery-ui-autocomplete). and I need to get the values inside the objects.
[03:59:27] <aaronmcadam> squeakytoy: what's the display rule of your element?
[03:59:37] <squeakytoy> define display rule
[03:59:42] <aaronmcadam> display : block
[03:59:58] <aaronmcadam> css...?
[04:01:29] <squeakytoy> inline
[04:02:41] <aaronmcadam> right
[04:03:00] <aaronmcadam> somebody in api comments says inline-block els return 0
[04:03:31] <squeakytoy> its sad i cannot recreate the problem with my testcase, only in my real environment
[04:03:33] <squeakytoy> oh well
[04:03:36] <squeakytoy> IE9 bugs are fun
[04:04:10] <aaronmcadam> squeakytoy: usually that's the best way to fix your problem

[05:02:04] <the_hack> It doesn't seem I can attach a Jquery element to a variable as i could in Prototype like var element = $("#myElement"); element.detatch(); Is there a way around, or must I just restate the element with jQuery each time I want to use a method?
[05:04:07] <the_hack> A basic jQuery question for anyone:
[05:04:15] <the_hack>  It doesn't seem I can attach a Jquery element to a variable as i could in Prototype like var element = $("#myElement"); element.detatch(); Is there a way around, or must I just restate the element with jQuery each time I want to use a method?
[05:04:45] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[05:04:56] <aaronmcadam> you completely can
[05:05:23] <sodapop> i have an <input> field inside multiple <li> fields how can i remove the entire li if input is clicked
[05:05:23] <shomon> smftre, I think that should be possible: there should be timer related stuff you can do in js, at least there were 10 years ago when last I checked :)
[05:06:33] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: I'm getting: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has not method 'detatch'
[05:06:55] <shomon> http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp sorry for the w3schools link but there's a bit about it there, smftre
[05:07:02] <the_hack> correction: has *no* method
[05:09:10] <smftre> thanks aaronmcadam, shomon
[05:10:03] <shomon> I guess the other thing might be changing the innerhtml on a div to the value you want... but you could probably use a text box
[05:10:17] <shomon> and I'm a complete newb with that stuff...
[05:10:48] <Blaster> hey I have a table, with a form below it.  When I submit the form, I want it to add a row to the database (with external php script) and add the new row to the table, without even leaving the page.  Which functions should I be looking at in the docs?
[05:11:21] <smftre> Blaster: .ajax()
[05:12:17] <Blaster> so that would allow me to communicate with an external php script, then it would check and verify a response, then use some sort of function to append a row to the HTML table and output a message?
[05:13:23] <smftre> Blaster: correct
[05:13:36] <Blaster> nice
[05:13:46] <sodapop> is this correct $(this).parent('tr:first').remove(); ?
[05:14:13] <sodapop> i want remove the entire row when an element is clicked in it
[05:21:58] <dgx> Hey all. Is it possible to specify an URL(example.com/lightbox) and when the document loads it will autostart the lightbox effect, or example?
[05:23:53] <jjulian> hi is it possible that query doesn't follow a redirect in an ajax call?
[05:24:46] <kh4n> dgx: you want to open a lightbox window after document load with the loaded what? remote image?
[05:25:25] <kh4n> jjulian: afaik, you shouldn't be using redirect withing ajax calls
[05:26:18] <jjulian> the redirect only happens in special circumstances
[05:26:39] <jjulian> and i don't want to follow them. The problem is i don't have any hands on the server side.
[05:26:48] <jjulian> and both pages deliver html as source
[05:31:20] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: can I use a jQuery method on a variable holding an element which was created in vanilla javascipt like this: overlay = document.createElement('div'); ... overlay.detatch();?
[05:31:58] <jjulian> kh4n: any ideas? maybe after the call is set any value i cat get to see if the url matches what i called?!
[05:32:54] <dgx> kh4n: Yes, its just an DIV instead of an image, but those are details, the idea is what you said.
[05:33:22] <aaronmcadam> why do you want to detach it the_hack
[05:33:47] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: it is a modal window
[05:34:00] <aaronmcadam> so? why detach it from the dom?
[05:34:17] <aaronmcadam> ?detach
[05:34:17] <bot-t> .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[05:35:22] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: I wrote a Prototype modal window and I'm trying to convert to jQuery, but I'm a little unfamiliar. Detatch just seemed better than remove because it would still be available later.
[05:37:55] <aaronmcadam> ah ok
[05:38:08] <aaronmcadam> you can't do it like that the_hack
[05:38:14] <aaronmcadam> you'd need to do $( overlay ).detach()
[05:38:25] <aaronmcadam> i.e. wrap the dom element in jQuery
[05:38:33] <the_hack> oh wow ok
[05:38:33] <johanhar> I want to find all input fields that is not empty, is that possible with $("#formid input:not(:empty)") - Thanks
[05:38:48] <aaronmcadam> the_hack, jQuery does not extend the prototype, that's why
[05:39:20] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: I suppose that is for security?
[05:39:27] <aaronmcadam> code collision
[05:39:30] <aaronmcadam> many reasons
[05:39:45] <aaronmcadam> native vs host objects, etc etc etc
[05:39:51] <aaronmcadam> it's well documented
[05:39:57] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: thanks.
[05:39:59] <aaronmcadam> the reasons against extending the prototype
[05:41:14] <johanhar> Because the input tag cannot have any children, only a value, what is the equivalent to :empty?
[05:41:41] <aaronmcadam> the_hack: http://perfectionkills.com/whats-wrong-with-extending-the-dom/
[05:41:56] <aaronmcadam> boom johanhar
[05:42:02] <the_hack> aarmonmcadam: I'll give it a read.
[05:42:09] <aaronmcadam> it's very long :P
[05:42:16] <aaronmcadam> and gets quite technical
[05:42:21] <aaronmcadam> but it's good stuff
[05:43:27] <dirkpennings> anyone knows a good css3 translate3d accordion fot iphone 4? (tested cubiq.org, but don't think it's complete)
[05:43:28] <BreezeKeeper> hi .. how can i disable the datepicker without to disable the input field itself ? .. if i use .datepicker(disable) jquery adds a disabled attribut, why i cant use the data
[05:43:39] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: I learned Prototype before I learned Javascript, thus my disfunction.
[05:44:01] <johanhar> aaronmcadam: "boom johanhar" ? Hmm ?
[05:44:04] <aaronmcadam> ah well, least you've left it behind
[05:44:16] <aaronmcadam> yeah you got the right answer :D
[05:44:16] <the_hack> :)
[05:48:09] <aaronmcadam> yay
[05:48:19] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: I'm still running into 'no such method: detatch' would you mind looking at my code if I throw up a link?
[05:48:23] <aaronmcadam> first usage of $.fn.prop :)
[05:48:34] <aaronmcadam> no, make a fiddle
[05:48:37] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ the_hack
[05:48:37] <bot-t> the_hack, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:48:54] <aaronmcadam> why don't you just do $( '<div />').detach()
[05:49:03] <aaronmcadam> use the api you're given maybe
[05:49:12] <aaronmcadam> but that doesn't make sense
[05:49:25] <aaronmcadam> because creating an element doesn't attach it to the dom in the first place
[05:51:56] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: Im not sure what is going on: I had it working in Prototype, so it has something to do with the methods not working the same way in jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/ewWka/
[05:53:21] <aaronmcadam> of course
[05:53:50] <aaronmcadam> jesus
[05:54:59] <aaronmcadam> try it with just the code you need
[05:55:08] <muzone> For a "choose your country" for shipping / currency, what's best, simple selectboxes like http://www.mytheresa.com/eu_en/ (nice and minimal, but a bit dull?) - or an interactive JS map where the user first clicks her region and then chooses the country / currency? Like http://www.luisaviaroma.com/index.aspx?#getLogIn.aspx|CallType=CurrAndShip&action=vis&season=actual&gender=women&fromWhoCurrAndShip=0 (kinda awesome, but a lot of work - makes 
[05:55:12] <aaronmcadam> i.e. without the actual modal code
[05:55:51] <aaronmcadam> i dunno why you're even implementing this yourself the_hack
[05:55:59] <aaronmcadam> fancybox or jquery ui is fine
[05:56:19] <ccmonsters> muzone, it seems like the map is cool, but maybe extreme for something like this.
[05:56:41] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: I wanted to create a modal that worked like alert.
[05:56:41] <ccmonsters> Then they have to spend time finding their country, which might be small and hard to select.
[05:57:01] <aaronmcadam> what modal doesn't
[05:57:09] <aaronmcadam> the only difference is the blocking behaviour
[05:57:14] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: so you call it like say('your message here');
[05:57:22] <muzone> ccmonsters: I was thinking they'd select their region, and then a box pops up where they select their country from a selectbox
[05:57:35] <muzone> ccmonsters: how does that sound?
[05:57:49] <aaronmcadam> change your style attrs into classes for a start
[05:58:07] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: ok
[05:58:38] <aaronmcadam> you're also not preventing the default click action
[05:58:45] <aaronmcadam> ?preventDefault the_hack

[05:58:54] <aaronmcadam> ah fuck me
[05:58:58] <aaronmcadam> ?preventDefault @ the_hack

[05:59:29] <ccmonsters> So, click a region on a map (ie Africa, Europe, Americas etc), which triggers a select box to populate with choices, then have then select their exact country/currency from the select box?

[06:00:27] <muzone> ccmonsters: Yes, that's it.
[06:00:32] <aaronmcadam> stop trying to wade through it blindly the_hack
[06:00:42] <muzone> ccmonsters: So what you think?
[06:01:02] <muzone> ccmonsters: its probably easier skipping the map and going straight to the country / currency selectbox but yeah, that's not so cool
[06:01:08] <DocD2> Hi guys,  do you know if you can use jquery template with no compatability mode?
[06:01:19] <johanhar> Hi. When I bind the event submit to a form, do I need to return false/true when Im done (I preventDefault).
[06:01:26] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[06:01:40] <aaronmcadam> no compatibility?
[06:01:49] <muzone> i want to make some sales, i want my customers to feel comfortable with me and with having items shipped across the globe. was hoping an interactive map like this would make me more international as i mentioned
[06:01:54] <aaronmcadam> what are you talkin about DocD2
[06:01:56] <ccmonsters> Then go with your gut.
[06:02:01] <the_hack> aaronmcadam: advice taken.
[06:02:15] <aaronmcadam> cool
[06:02:42] <aaronmcadam> you're also calling toString on a variable that's already a string (message)
[06:03:04] <DocD2> I'm using this http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/template-tags/ but have  jQuery.noConflict(); its erroring in IE8 on an encode issue.  I was wondering if I can use compatability and the tmeplate stuff?
[06:03:05] <muzone> hheheh
[06:03:09] <muzone> ccmonsters: thanks man=)
[06:03:28] <aaronmcadam> why are you using noConflict? what other lib?
[06:03:36] <aaronmcadam> it shouldn't matter
[06:03:54] <DocD2> yes I am using prototype as well
[06:03:58] <aaronmcadam> eeesh

Unfortunately, BlankMap-World6-Equirectangular.svg is way too big in filesize. Can somebody offer any advice on how to trim it down? I've opened it in Illustrator and grouped together the various countries into regions, but I'm not really sure where to go from here.
[06:04:21] <DocD2> but only in Ie8:(
[06:04:32] <muzone> Like how do I erase the individual country borders? (so that only the regional borders remain) I'm hoping that'll trim it down a little. Sorry if this is more of an Illustrator question though.
[06:04:39] <aaronmcadam> don't use min for development DocD2
[06:04:59] <aaronmcadam> are you sure it's not missing semicolons or trailing commas in object literals
[06:05:26] <DocD2> aaron wouldn't that error in the other browesers as well?
[06:06:01] <jeffsmykil> What would be the best way to create a toggle switch animation where you click the toggle it goes up and then goes back down to theoriginal position
[06:06:31] <jeffsmykil> ive tried using queue but im having issues with it working after the first time
[06:07:36] <aaronmcadam> just use unminified and post what it says

[06:20:30] <aidan> Is it possible google maps API just died?
[06:20:53] <Elephant> like not responding?
[06:21:01] <Elephant> I find it highly unlikely
[06:22:08] <aidan> Site worked yesterday, doesn't work today, verified by checking the snapshot from 4 months ago and it's broken too
[06:22:32] <aidan> Some API change I suspect ..
[06:22:36] <uchuff> my api maps pages are working fine
[06:22:52] <aidan> http://www.mssociety.org.uk/near-me
[06:23:07] <uchuff> looks fine to me
[06:23:15] <uchuff> nice marker images
[06:23:16] <aidan> are you using markerclusterer? might be specific to that plugin
[06:23:22] <aidan> you should see hundreds of markers
[06:23:46] <uchuff> oh
[06:23:54] <uchuff> no, only seeing like 3 orange ones
[06:24:03] <aidan> yeah, and check console
[06:24:22] <uchuff> clustering does appear a bit odd
[06:24:36] <uchuff> ya
[06:24:39] <uchuff> i see what you mean
[06:25:00] <aidan> Weird huh
[06:25:04] <uchuff> I'm using stock v2 maps api on my site and it's fine
[06:25:12] <uchuff> so yeah, clustering plugin could be the issue
[06:26:53] <uchuff> damn, i should use a new version of the api, that white Google logo is much better
[06:27:04] <aidan> yeah v3 is much nicer

[06:44:46] <Azrael_-> hi
[06:45:47] <Azrael_-> i try the jquery tools overlay and want the displayed div to have opacity. but when i display it, the filter for ie is automatically overwritten. how can i change this?
[06:54:11] <AL13N_work> i'm having an issue: i have a .js file that declares a function, and a script part at the end of the file that executes the function, but the function is not loaded, even though both are only defined after document ready...
[06:56:09] <pootietang> sup peeps!
[06:58:23] <pmcgovern> good morning all
[06:59:49] <pmcgovern> Has anyone had issues with forms not submitting when using the validator plugin? I'm not using submitHandler :/
[07:00:12] <pmcgovern> I have the code available on paste if anyone is willing to take a look
[07:00:14] <pmcgovern> http://pastie.org/2563116
[07:01:32] <pmcgovern> and, of course, I'm being called into a meeting - i'll come back in and re-ask in a bit
[07:03:45] <Blaster>  i have a javascript file with admin jquery ajax stuff in it.  how can I prevent anyone from executing it?
[07:05:12] <discorpia> Blaster: you should authenticate the user in your ajax requests, i.e. check session data to make sure the user is logged in and really an admin
[07:05:43] <Blaster> oh ok
[07:06:32] <discorpia> Blaster: you can prevent others from seeing the contents if you make it a php-file and check auth before the javascript-content. (i.e. admin-ajax.js.php) but that would still leave your services (the urls called by the ajax) open unless you also secure them like above
[07:12:08] <RingZer01> Is there any way to create an event listener to listen to when an html attribute (e.g. href) changes by another script changing it?
[07:13:32] <discorpia> RingZer01: something like http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/2008/Sep/12/jQuery-CSS-Property-Monitoring-Plugin-updated ?
[07:19:32] <jjulian> is it possible to see if an ajax request got redirected?
[07:20:42] <RingZer01> discorpia: thank you very much
[07:20:45] <RingZer01> that will work for me
[07:25:29] <acalbaza> is there a way to expose classes defined in a plugin?  i want to test them in a unit test, but they are inaccessable since they are wrapped in a closure.  i just want to make them available to me for the purpose of test (and i dont really want to put them in global scope)
[07:25:44] <RingZer01> Can you pass multiple (deliminated) selectors to the same .click() ?
[07:26:40] <RingZer01> its so weird how the first selector works still:  $('#IDX-ssImageURL,#IDX-priceLine a,#IDX-addressLine a,#IDX-cszLine a').click(function(){});
[07:27:06] <Nachtwind> hi.. as a bloddy newbie on JQUERY ajax and so on i have a question to you guys here.. i have the following function http://pastebin.com/TtM0R5WM   and submit via onChange the id of a form to this function. I come as far as "alert('in') - and then nothing happens anymore.. can someone point me some direction?
[07:28:34] <Blaster> are you allowed to do variables like this inside functions?  var dataString = 123;  var dataString += 456;  ?
[07:28:37] <Blaster> because it's throwing an error for me
[07:30:59] <RingZer01> Blaster: that's just regular javascript, what is the error?
[07:31:44] <Blaster> nvm it was supposed to be like
[07:31:51] <Blaster> var dataString = 123;  dataString += 456;  ?
[07:31:55] <Blaster> and it worked
[07:31:58] <Blaster> without the ? :)
[07:32:50] <AL13N_work> i'm having an issue: i have a .js file that declares a function, and a script part at the end of the file that executes the function, but the function is not loaded, even though both are only defined after document ready...
[07:33:35] <amcsi_work> hello
[07:33:44] <Blaster> someone earlier said that you should verify a user is an admin and logged in by using sessions (for ajax) but how does your processing PHP script get the session?
[07:33:58] <seutje> AL13N_work: why do u define a function after doc rdy?
[07:33:59] <Blaster> i dont want non-admins accessing my ajax request
[07:34:22] <amcsi_work> can I make a single event handler that does something when the event is fired, and a different thing when the event bubbles up to a certain selector?
[07:34:32] <seutje> certainly
[07:34:48] <amcsi_work> how?
[07:34:53] <seutje> check this against event.target
[07:35:33] <axscode>       $('form#float-admin select#float-options-position-1').change(function()    <-- how to declare this if my select id is incremental?  select#float-options-position-1, select#float-options-position-2, select#float-options-position-3 etc...
[07:35:41] <amcsi_work> basically I have a checkbox wrapped in something, and I want to do preventDefault on the checkbox, but I want to do something else when the event bubbles up to the div
[07:36:49] <the_hack> arronmcadam: I still haven't found the root of my problem $( overlay).remove(); works but $(overlay).detatch(); gets 'no such method detatch'.
[07:37:34] <Nachtwind> var formParams =$("#"+frmElement).serialize();            i get an uncaught exception here when i submit as frmElement the name/id of a form.. any ideas?
[07:38:06] <seutje> amcsi_work: $(something).bind('someEvent', function(e) { if (this == $(e.target).get(0) { /* the event was fired on the element the handler was bound to */ } });
[07:38:11] <amcsi_work> for $('div.click, fn), it is too late to do evt.preventDefault() on the checkbox, but $('div.click, fn) and $('div.click input:checkbox', function (evt) {evt.preventDefault()} makes the firsthandler get fired twice
[07:38:22] <seutje> assuming $(something) only had a singly matching element
[07:38:48] <seutje> single*
[07:39:05] <seutje> missing a paren -_-
[07:39:57] <amcsi_work> if the something is the div, then that will only fire by bubbling if the checkbox was clicked
[07:40:05] <amcsi_work> and by that time, evt.preventDefault is too alte
[07:41:26] <the_hack> seutje: why would $(overlay).remove(); work but not $(overlay).detatch(); ?
[07:42:41] <Blaster> hmmm.. im just wondering something.. how would the URL of a ajax query know the cookies of the current browser?  Is that page actually loaded in the browser or something?
[07:43:20] <seutje> the_hack: why are u asking me? this is my first day using jQuery
[07:43:44] <seutje> Blaster: any request header will contain the cookie information afaik
[07:43:59] <the_hack> seutje: sorry I thought you were answering questions :D
[07:44:02] <seutje> Blaster: if ur browser requests an image, it will send the cookie information
[07:44:17] <seutje> the_hack: only those I actually think to know
[07:44:32] <Blaster> right, but in an Ajax query, the URL of that query is actually passed cookies from the users browser?
[07:45:07] <Brodingo> i wish someone would pass me cookies
[07:46:17] <daevski> Is there a return false or something I can do to get this to END if the IF is true and executed? It seems to fire both the if and else: http://jsfiddle.net/Egjur/
[07:47:03] <Blaster> so can my ajax query send back output from the requested page?
[07:47:27] <Brodingo> thats the idea
[07:47:48] <orbitz> Hello!  I am very new to jQuery and web dev in general.  I'm curious what is the easiest way to make a selectable match the theme I am currently using (the demo has seperate <style>). Thank you
[07:48:16] <Blaster> Brodingo: so how do I get that data?
[07:48:23] <Blaster> into a variable
[07:48:33] <Brodingo> ?ajax101
[07:48:33] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[07:49:06] <orbitz> bot-t: jquery.ajax can take an error and success callback, set you variabel ther
[07:49:08] <bot-t> orbitz, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:49:08] <acalbaza> hmm, can you dynamically push things into a different namespace?
[07:49:14] <orbitz> ack
[07:49:17] <orbitz> Blaster: that was for you
[07:50:03] <orbitz> Blaster: Do you have anye xperience with asynchornous programming?
[07:51:27] <the_hack> why would $(overlay).remove(); work but not $(overlay).detatch(); ?
[07:51:47] <orbitz> detach?
[07:51:47] <Blaster> orbitz: Not really, first day
[07:52:07] <orbitz> Blaster: In JS, if something can block for awhile, you never wait for it to respond by doing var response = whatever()
[07:52:20] <orbitz> Blaster: instead you tell whatever() what you want to do once it's done
[07:52:29] <orbitz> so whatever(function(response) { .... })
[07:52:45] <the_hack> orbitz: well, I guess that's why!
[07:52:48] <orbitz> that way your JS app can do other things while whatever is happening
[07:52:54] <Blaster> oh cool
[07:53:33] <orbitz> Blaster: so if you wante dot do: var response = whatever(); console.log(response);  this would really be whatever(function(response) { console.log(response); });
[07:53:40] <orbitz> Blaster: so everything is inverted
[07:54:16] <Blaster> interesting
[07:54:30] <Blaster> i like everything so far, just noticing that things seem difficult to debug with ajax
[07:54:39] <orbitz> Blaster: how so?
[07:54:59] <Blaster> well the output of my PHP script, so I didn't know what was going on with it, but now that I can return the data that should be easier
[07:55:22] <orbitz> YOu can always perform an ajax call by hand with somethinglike curl to see what it returns
[07:55:52] <daevski> Is there a RETURN or something I can do to get this to END if the IF is true and executed? It seems to fire both the if and else: http://jsfiddle.net/Egjur/
[07:57:00] <orbitz> daevski: if the if and else are both executed you have bigger problems
[07:58:32] <daevski> orbitz, lol I know... maybe I can show you? one sec.
[07:59:16] <acalbaza> okay, im trying to see if this is on the right track... i want to be able to have a plugin that uses other object definitions from another namespace... could someone give me guidance and tell me if im on the right track? http://pastebin.com/DkTue44n
[07:59:28] <acalbaza> my goal is to have testable parts of this plugin...
[08:00:18] <daevski> orbitz, did you want to see the behavior?
[08:01:08] <orbitz> daevski: sure
[08:01:10] <daevski> orbitz, http://bit.ly/ndgZwy -- type 'd' in the To... field and then Down Arrow.
[08:01:15] <orbitz> daevski: not sure if I can help, i'm a noob here as well
[08:01:43] <daevski> orbitz, wel ok
[08:01:50] <orbitz> daevski: the problem is teh down arrow isn't registered?
[08:01:50] <daevski> Anyone else?
[08:02:14] <daevski> orbitz, no it registers, it just applies 'hovered' class and then removes it.
[08:02:36] <daevski> I'm not sure why it does it. I'm kinda confused
[08:02:44] <orbitz> which function is this in?
[08:03:03] <daevski> orbitz, just document ready statement
[08:03:40] <daevski> orbitz, you saw the jsfiddle, yes?
[08:03:58] <orbitz> daevski: Did you try some console.log's?
[08:05:04] <daevski> orbitz, well, it's doing the query every time and it should ONLY in the else...
[08:05:24] <daevski> orbitz, so I think I need to constrict the IF statement to be more exact?
[08:05:57] <daevski> orbitz, ohhh, actually yeah. I see the error in my code now lol
[08:06:03] <orbitz> what was it?
[08:06:09] <daevski> orbitz, it's all within the one IF lol
[08:06:24] <orbitz> :)
[08:06:42] <daevski> "if I press DOwn Arrow, do it all" is what it says really .... oh coffee, please kick in soon.
[08:06:57] <muzone> Brodingo: hey man
[08:07:04] <muzone> Brodingo: Using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-World6-Equirectangular.svg with Illustrator, I'm trying to group together countries of certain regions so I can reduce the SVG's filesize. But once I've grouped them together, how do I delete each individual country's border, so that only the new regional borders remain? I've tried Object > Path > Join, but that didn't do it. Anybody know?
[08:08:16] <axscode>       $('form#float-admin select#float-options-position-1').change(function()    <-- how to declare this if my select id is incremental?  select#float-options-position-1, select#float-options-position-2, select#float-options-position-3 etc...
[08:08:21] <Brodingo> muzone are the borders paths or a stroke?
[08:09:03] <orbitz> How come selectable doesn't have default theme values?
[08:09:08] <codebeaker> is there a global ajax:start hook which could be used to built
[08:09:08] <codebeaker> d
[08:09:20] <codebeaker> to build a subtle g-mail style loading indicator?
[08:09:45] <flint0131> *sighs*
[08:09:46] <pmcgovern> Hello again
[08:10:29] <muzone> Brodingo: im not really sure
[08:10:32] <muzone> Brodingo: paths i guess
[08:10:39] <pmcgovern> Having an issue using the validator plugin on a form - I'm not using submitHandler - but the form still will not submit. Anyone willing to take a look and point out my follie? http://pastie.org/2563116
[08:11:49] <daevski> orbitz, okay yes, the key is not registered. It doesn't care if I hit Down Arrow or not, it does the query. Why might it not know I'm hitting Key 40 ?
[08:12:35] <Brodingo> muzone well you may need to add a similar stroke color to fill so it gives the illusion of "expanding" the path and close the gaps between shapes
[08:13:21] <muzone> Brodingo: i mean like the border info, border definitions or whatever
[08:13:22] <daevski> Anyone know why this code does not recognize that I hit key 40? is it the keypress bind? (I'm experimenting) http://jsfiddle.net/Egjur/
[08:13:28] <muzone> the white line seperating them is just an outline or whatever its called
[08:14:08] <kborchers> ?ajaxStart @ codebeaker
[08:14:08] <bot-t> codebeaker, .ajaxStart(handler): Register a handler to be called when the first Ajax request begins. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[08:14:09] <rahmen> Hi! I want to prepend all images' src value that are in a specific container. Something like this: http://pastebin.com/v2wgNeZj But that's not working... Something like this would have been great too: $('.container img').attr('src', 'http://someotherdomain'+this.attr('src')); How do I achieve this?
[08:14:44] <Brodingo> muzone well its either negative space or a path
[08:15:29] <muzone> Brodingo: what do you mean?
[08:16:09] <Blaster> Im confused.. should my PHP return JSON to ajax if I want structured data?
[08:16:19] <Blaster> and if it does return json, how do I access each element in my success function?
[08:16:23] <muzone> Brodingo: i want to join countries together into regions, and then delete the country info from the svg so it doesn't take up so much space
[08:16:35] <daevski> Blaster, That sounds correct.
[08:16:40] <kborchers> rahmen: you should be able to do that this way http://pastebin.com/wD6bYSue
[08:16:42] <rahmen> I found a way: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4815398/jquery-to-prepend-url-in-img-src-attribute Always easier to solve it after asking here...
[08:16:54] <codebeaker> ahh, awesome thanks bot-t - the docs didn't read like that, actually
[08:17:04] <kborchers> ?imabot @ codebeaker
[08:17:04] <bot-t> codebeaker, -5 geek points for not noticing I am a bot.
[08:17:16] <daevski> Anyone know why this code does not recognize that I hit key 40? is it the keypress bind? (I'm experimenting) http://jsfiddle.net/Egjur/ -- It just runs everything within the first IF...
[08:17:17] <codebeaker> damn, I means kborchers :_D
[08:17:21] <kborchers> heh
[08:17:29] <Elephant> beep boop
[08:17:30] <rahmen> kborchers: ah, that's nice too thanks!
[08:17:35] <kborchers> np
[08:18:17] <Brodingo> muzone if you open that world map svg in your browser and inspect a country, youll see the stroke properties
[08:18:17] <codebeaker> kborchers: does that work in such a way that I can literally call $.ajaxStart(function(){ console.debug("AJAX Started"); })
[08:18:35] <codebeaker> or does it have to exist on something
[08:19:19] <muzone> Brodingo: sorry but what are you talking about? i dont need to play around with the stroke properties
[08:19:36] <kborchers> ?tias @ codebeaker
[08:19:36] <bot-t> codebeaker, Try It And See
[08:19:40] <kborchers> ;)
[08:19:45] <codebeaker> thanks kborchers :) will do
[08:20:00] <Brodingo> muzone what do you need to do
[08:20:04] <pmcgovern> Anyone with JQuery Validator plugin willing to take a look at this and point out why the form won't submit (no errors)? http://pastie.org/2563116
[08:20:06] <codebeaker> (going to take that as a yes until I have some time :-D) I assume it'll work
[08:20:39] <muzone> Brodingo: i want to join countries together into regions, and then delete the country info from the svg so it doesn't take up so much space
[08:21:19] <muzone> Brodingo: users should then be able to select their regions as opposed to their countries, and, the SVG will be small enough for this to be feasible using raphaeljs
[08:21:50] <Brodingo> muzone then i would do the stroke thing in illustrator, expand the shapes and merge them as needed
[08:21:58] <kborchers> codebeaker: don't think you can do it that way but you could just do $(document).ajaxStart(... but I haven't tried it your way
[08:22:47] <codebeaker> thanks kborchers - I will try it out, thanks for the tip (actually, I did already try it out, but on window (didn't work) - and also not individual
[08:22:52] <muzone> Brodingo: what stroke thing?
[08:23:08] <muzone> Brodingo: in illustrator now i've grouped together a bunch of countries. but how do i merge them?
[08:23:46] <Brodingo> change the stroke from white, to the same color as the fills, make them larger so they other lap and close the gaps between shapes, expand their appearance, and use merge in the pathfinder tools to create regions
[08:25:52] <ccmonsters> hey guys, I am getting a 'expected string' yadda in IE8. The line is var c = $('<li/>').prepend($('<a/>',{href:'#',class:'internal-page breadcrumb','data-name':$this.data('name'),text:$this.text()}));
[08:26:01] <muzone> Brodingo: if i just disable strokes there wont be no gaps between the shapes no more
[08:26:07] <muzone> Brodingo: looking into the merge
[08:26:09] <ccmonsters> usually that means extra hanging comma in a object literal, but that doesn't appear to be the case.
[08:26:15] <Brodingo> yeah maybe
[08:27:18] <muzone> Brodingo: found the pathfinder thing, awesome man!!
[08:27:43] <Brodingo> that little pallet will be responsible for most of the cool things achieved in illustrator
[08:31:29] <clownshack> quick question - say I am selecting $('div[rel]') - how do I dynamically get the value of the attribute rel … the selector could change to $('div[id]') and I would want the script to automatically grab the id value instead of rel - any tips?
[08:32:08] <twisted`> yo :) for some reason my jqueryui autocomplete functions fine in Chrome/Safari/Firefox but it doesn't work -at- all in IE8/IE9
[08:32:17] <twisted`> and I have no idea how to debug it in IE8/9
[08:33:23] <clownshack> F12 will open your developer "tool" in IE9 - but its horrid compared to chrome/ffox … (my personal opinion) … dont think it will let you debug as efficiently either
[08:33:59] <clownshack> havent tried watching variables with it or anything like that yet
[08:34:15] <twisted`> clownshack: yeah that's the problem
[08:34:22] <clownshack> exactly
[08:34:24] <twisted`> the developer toolbar doesn't show me at all what's going on
[08:34:37] <twisted`> in Chrome/Firefox I can look at the network and see what's being called
[08:34:38] <clownshack> lol thanks again microsoft for boning us :P
[08:34:41] <twisted`> or see what's being done
[08:35:08] <twisted`> clownshack: if you want to take a look at the page maybe you see a syntax error in my code for IE (I heard IE is more picky with JS then the other browsers)
[08:35:23] <clownshack> sure ill take a quick peek
[08:35:39] <clownshack> msg me the link
[08:38:26] <daevski> Anyone know why this code is ignoring my if/else structure? I've tested that key 40 is true, but it executes everything anyways.  http://jsfiddle.net/Egjur/ -- It just runs everything within the first IF...
[08:39:03] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/Egjur/ <-- can someone help out, goal is, the jquery should matched on IDs = "select-id-1" and "select-id-2", but not the rest. so only on "select-id-XXXX"
[08:39:18] <axscode> is there something like wildcard in calling on jquery
[08:40:17] <Haegin> Hi, I have a table with input elements in, some of which may be filled and I'm trying to get a jquery selector to match table rows with only empty input elements in them. How would I even start to do this?
[08:40:20] <daevski> axscode, you have my link in your question.
[08:40:49] <axscode> demmit
[08:41:29] <daevski> Haegin, $('#field').html().value('') might work
[08:43:42] <Haegin> daevski: won't that return all the empty input elements, not the rows with only empty elements in it?
[08:43:48] <sixty7ideas> with jquery templates, can i simply say <script id="template" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl" src="template.tmpl"></script> instead of putting it inline?
[08:44:20] <daevski> Haegin, ah, good point. I mis-read.
[08:44:39] <Haegin> daevski: yeah, I thought it was simple at first, alas :(
[08:46:09] <daevski> Haegin, I think you would have to create a loop that goes through $(tr) and returns true if they are all empty.
[08:47:19] <daevski> Anyone know why this code is ignoring my if/else structure? I've tested that key 40 is true, but it executes everything anyways.  http://jsfiddle.net/Egjur/ -- It just runs everything within the first IF...
[08:47:37] <muzone> Brodingo: after running Merge, Europe is left with tons of stray points, and running Object > Path > Clean Up has no visible effect: http://i.imgur.com/cUiWq.jpg. Is there a way to clean this up without having to manually delete each point?
[08:47:55] <Brodingo> i told you
[08:48:02] <Haegin> daevski: yeah, I think I'm getting somewhere with $("form tr").filter(function() {$(this).children("input").each(function(){$(this).html()
[08:48:09] <Haegin> or something like that...
[08:48:17] <Brodingo> bigger stroke to make the shapes overlap then merge
[08:48:23] <Brodingo> didnt i tell you?
[08:48:41] <muzone> oh yeah!!
[08:48:44] <muzone> sorry bro
[08:49:58] <ccmonsters> var c = $('<li/>').prepend($('<a/>',{href:'#',class:'internal-page breadcrumb','data-name':$this.data('name'),text:$this.text()})); -- this is giving me an expected string in IE8. What's up with that?
[08:50:17] <muzone> Brodingo: makes no difference im afraid. i just tried some insanely huge strokes
[08:50:46] <aaronmcadam> ccmonsters: haha old mistake, using keywords
[08:50:58] <Brodingo> you really only need like 2px stroke, expand the appearance so the stroke becomes part of the fill, then merge
[08:51:06] <aaronmcadam> ccmonsters: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words
[08:51:42] <ccmonsters> so what's wrong? which is reserved?
[08:51:45] <ccmonsters> class?
[08:51:46] <aaronmcadam> class
[08:51:48] <aaronmcadam> yes
[08:51:48] <muzone> Brodingo: i am unable to good sir, even with expand appearance
[08:51:58] <aaronmcadam> just quote your keys
[08:51:58] <faraway> hi. i'm looking for a plugin that is able to find out part of the text in my document where the mouse is currently pointing on, so that i'm able to insert a dom element at this position in the text. does anyone know such a plugin? (want to be able to insert something via drag and drop into the text)
[08:52:18] <Brodingo> muzone are you doing it to the region you already tried to make or the individual countries
[08:52:25] <ccmonsters> got it.
[08:52:35] <aaronmcadam> just one to be aware of
[08:52:35] <muzone> Brodingo: to the region..
[08:52:37] <ccmonsters> for some reason I think i knew that, but apprently ignored my instinct.
[08:52:40] <Brodingo> well
[08:52:45] <muzone> Brodingo: although that selects all the countries so..
[08:52:53] <aaronmcadam> they're protected in case ecmascript will use em in future
[08:53:01] <aaronmcadam> tho I hope they don't use class lol
[08:53:53] <muzone> Brodingo: http://home.no/dwaynie/world_map_equirectangular.ai for the groupings for what it's worth
[08:55:07] <ccmonsters> ok, now another weird one. var r = item.id.slice(6).toLowerCase().trim();
[08:55:14] <ccmonsters> this is only complained by ie8.
[08:55:23] <aaronmcadam> ie8 might not have native trim
[08:55:38] <aaronmcadam> you'd need to wrap that in jQ to get its trim() method
[08:55:58] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[08:55:59] <aaronmcadam> i.e. $( item.id.slice(6).toLowerCase() ).trim()
[08:56:05] <ProLoser|Work> what's the best way to make a callback arg optional?
[08:56:15] <aaronmcadam> ?noop @ ProLoser|Work
[08:56:16] <bot-t> ProLoser|Work, jQuery.noop(): An empty function. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noop/
[08:56:35] <aaronmcadam> callback = callback || $.noop
[08:56:35] <ccmonsters> interesting. so i need to get in the habit of doing that to avoid ie bugs
[08:56:44] <_ramo> Hi
[08:56:54] <erichynds> ccmonsters: $.trim( str );
[08:56:55] <ProLoser|Work> callback = (typeof callback != "undefined")? callback: function(){};
[08:56:55] <_ramo> is jQuery.ajax working in jquery version 1.4.2 ?
[08:56:57] <ProLoser|Work> ah okay
[08:56:59] <ProLoser|Work> thank you
[08:57:00] <aaronmcadam> ah that's it
[08:57:15] <aaronmcadam> noop is basically the same as that ProLoser|Work
[08:57:19] <aaronmcadam> but yeah
[08:57:26] <aaronmcadam> use the API I suppose :)
[08:57:27] <ProLoser|Work> yours is liter, and that's what i wanted to know, thanks
[08:57:37] <aaronmcadam> yeah you don't need undefined
[08:57:44] <ProLoser|Work> coo
[08:58:11] <aaronmcadam> or the ternary ;)
[08:58:39] <ccmonsters> that's sort of frustrating to have to do that for ie.
[08:59:53] <aaronmcadam> not really
[09:00:17] <aaronmcadam> you just need to be aware of what is actually implemented and use shims for ecma features
[09:00:28] <aaronmcadam> undescore ftw :)
[09:00:51] <muzone> Brodingo: any clue what a bro can do great mandingo warrior
[09:01:40] <Brodingo> i dunno man, pretty comlicated shape, it would be easier if it was group correctly and stuff, ive done my best so steer you in the right direction
[09:02:41] <muzone> Brodingo: you have indeed man, thanks for that..
[09:03:15] <muzone> Brodingo: so i have to manually delete each point?
[09:03:28] <Brodingo> yeah possibly
[09:03:36] <Ankabout> can anyone help me make this jquery into a loop?
[09:03:37] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/4am9g/8/
[09:04:14] <Brodingo> i know the technique i describe works because ive done it before, but that shape is so complicated its hard to select exactly what you want for it to work right
[09:05:16] <webPragmatist> anyone point me to a modal that does esc and offclick but also sizes the container dynamically/
[09:05:25] <webPragmatist> I'm using simple modal but it doesn't size the height dynamically
[09:05:59] <Brodingo> ?colorbox @ webPragmatist
[09:06:00] <bot-t> webPragmatist, ColorBox (plugin) - A light-weight, customizable lightbox plugin for jQuery 1.3 & 1.4 http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/
[09:06:39] <clownshack> quick question - say I am selecting $('div[rel]') - how do I dynamically get the value of the attribute rel … the selector could change to $('div[id]') and I would want the script to automatically grab the id value instead of rel - any tips?
[09:07:41] <Eviltwin> Ankabout: What's the problem?
[09:07:53] <Eviltwin> webPragmatist: Are you looking at http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ ?
[09:08:21] <Ankabout> Eviltwin, I can't seem to figure out how to do it. Basically each #container .item I want to put in an array (I guesS) and then change the text of .item-first one by one using the array
[09:08:54] <Eviltwin> clownshack: I think the closest you could get is $('div['+a+']').prop(a)
[09:09:08] <clownshack> thanks - ill look into it :)
[09:10:08] <webPragmatist> Eviltwin: eh
[09:11:25] <daevski> how can I say: keypress, wait a second, then run code?
[09:11:35] <Eviltwin> Ankabout: Can you try to boil your problem down a bit more?
[09:11:51] <Eviltwin> Ankabout: It's hard to debug just a huge block of code
[09:11:55] <Ankabout> Eviltwin, wait I think I was confusing JS and jquery
[09:12:10] <Ankabout> maybe I can get a bit closer to what I want without help first... one sec...
[09:12:23] <Eviltwin> dipsol: $("selector").keypress(function(){setTimeout(function(){...},1000)})
[09:12:42] <daevski> Correction * how can I say: keypress, wait a second for more, if more cancel, then run code only on last keypress?
[09:13:00] <daevski> Eviltwin, ah, I see
[09:13:01] <dipsol> is that jquery?
[09:13:04] <daevski> Thank you
[09:13:32] <clownshack> Eviltwin: what you had in the () of .prop() got turned into an emoticon for me - could you post it again … sorry (i turned off all emoticons) lol
[09:14:04] <Eviltwin> clownshack: I think the closest you could get is $('div['+a+']').prop(a)
[09:14:14] <clownshack> thnx
[09:14:36] <Eviltwin> daevski: setTimeout is JavaScript
[09:14:40] <Ankabout> Eviltwin, ok a simple first question to get me started, as I can't find it in the docs...
[09:14:50] <Ankabout> how do I add the texts of a bunch of child elements into an array?
[09:15:06] <Eviltwin> Are you looking at this? http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/shuffle-letters-effect-jquery/
[09:15:07] <Ankabout> so in my jFiddle, I want to add the texts of each .item into an array
[09:15:09] <dipsol> by using the each
[09:15:16] <enapupe> Ankabout: each, .prush..
[09:15:17] <daevski> Eviltwin, lol no wonder I was not finding it in query api. Thanks again
[09:15:22] <enapupe> push*
[09:15:23] <Ankabout> Eviltwin, the shuffle works, so that's fine
[09:15:25] <ajpiano> clownshack: $.fn.filterThenAttr = function( attr ) {  return this.filter("[" + attr + "]").attr( attr) );  }
[09:15:38] <ajpiano> $("div").filterThenAttr("id");
[09:15:38] <Ankabout> it's looping it between my strings that I can't get working
[09:15:51] <webPragmatist> Brodingo:  have you tried this with inline content?
[09:15:51] <Eviltwin> ? .map @ Ankabout
[09:15:52] <bot-t> Ankabout, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[09:15:58] <webPragmatist> Brodingo: it's not working for some reason for me
[09:16:09] <Ankabout> enapupe, Eviltwin, thanks that looks clearer...
[09:16:14] <webPragmatist> ah crap nm
[09:16:16] <Brodingo> make sure your options are set? inline: true
[09:16:26] <clownshack> ajpiano: thanks :)
[09:17:01] <JonathanCutrell> Hello folks.
[09:17:16] <webPragmatist> ya i have$("#productOptions").colorbox({inline:true, href:"#btn-single-cart"});
[09:17:23] <Ankabout> so if I do var myArray = $(".selector").map();, would that work/
[09:17:36] <webPragmatist> #productOptions is the inline block… #btn-single-cart is the "id" of the <a (also the href"
[09:17:43] <webPragmatist> even though that makes no sense
[09:18:16] <JonathanCutrell> So, here's a good question. What exactly does $.proxy do?
[09:18:24] <JonathanCutrell> Everything I've read isn't quite making sense to me.
[09:18:58] <erichynds> JonathanCutrell: changes the context - or what "this" refers to - inside a function.
[09:19:34] <daevski> Eviltwin, that actually worked perfectly. I will remember it.
[09:19:50] <Brodingo> webPragmatist you need to reverse those ids then
[09:19:51] <JonathanCutrell> erichynds: Hrm. So generally it would refer to the element the method is being called on, correct?
[09:20:06] <erichynds> JonathanCutrell: in jQuery that's usually the case
[09:20:17] <webPragmatist> Brodingo: $('#inline_content') … href is some random <a with that specific href?
[09:20:30] <JonathanCutrell> erichynds: right right - so proxy would allow you to reference something else then.
[09:20:30] <webPragmatist> so they can literally be both the same
[09:20:30] <Brodingo> no the href is what loads into the colorbox
[09:20:38] <Brodingo> you need to attach the colorbox call to the anchor
[09:20:43] <webPragmatist> oh
[09:20:48] <daevski> Eviltwin, oh wait, it still runs the code on all the letters input. So say I type 'daevs' I want it to only query 'daevs' not a query for each letter after the setTimeout...
[09:21:12] <erichynds> JonathanCutrell: function foo(){}; $("a").click( foo ); $("a").click($.proxy(foo, "window")); - in the first click(), "this" is a DOM element, in the second it's the window object
[09:21:31] <erichynds> if I hadn't wrapped window in quotes, that is..
[09:21:41] <Eviltwin> daevski: So you probably want to cancel the timeout
[09:21:46] <webPragmatist> Brodingo: wait what?
[09:21:59] <webPragmatist> so href:"#my_inline_content"
[09:22:00] <JonathanCutrell> erichynds: gotcha. I'd be interested to see how that is used in a real world scenario.
[09:22:03] <ghostbar> Hi, I'm using this ➜ http://ghostbar.ath.cx/2011/09/13/changing-background-syncd-with-jqueryui-tabs/ but the background image changes like 1second after, is there a way to avoid this? Make it change at the same time?
[09:22:04] <Eviltwin> daevski: var timer = setTimeout(function(){...},1000); ...; clearTimeout(timer);
[09:22:15] <daevski> Eviltwin, yes, if there is a new keypress only.
[09:22:33] <erichynds> JonathanCutrell: 1 sec
[09:22:41] <webPragmatist> Brodingo: is href just used to pull it up based on the url?
[09:22:44] <JonathanCutrell> erichynds: no worries.
[09:23:01] <Eviltwin> daevski: var timer; $(window).keypress(function(){clearTimeout(timer); setTimeout(function() { ... }, 1000); })
[09:23:12] <Brodingo> webPragmatist if its inline: true, href becomes the selector
[09:24:10] <webPragmatist> Brodingo: can i just drop the href?
[09:24:11] <daevski> Eviltwin, mk. I'll try that. Thanks
[09:24:28] <Brodingo> youd wanna do href="#"
[09:25:00] <erichynds> JonathanCutrell: http://pastie.org/2563749
[09:26:07] <JonathanCutrell> erichynds: nice example.
[09:26:09] <crowemi> http://pastebin.com/DSkeQdHE this is driving me crazy! The jQuery after the for loop doesn't execute, anyone know why?!? I think I've narrowed the problem to the jQuery on line 7
[09:26:11] <JonathanCutrell> erichynds: thanks for that.
[09:26:15] <erichynds> <3
[09:26:57] <Eviltwin> crowemi: Run that through JSLint and send us a new link
[09:28:15] <crowemi> Eviltwin: Thanks, will do.
[09:28:16] <JonathanCutrell> erichynds: now the next once I've been wondering about is deferred. But I' have read less about it, so I'll stomp through some docs.
[09:28:57] <daevski> Eviltwin, Not sure I understand the setting of 'var timer;' -- here is my code so far: http://jsfiddle.net/Egjur/2/
[09:29:44] <ghostbar> Hi, I'm using this ➜ http://ghostbar.ath.cx/2011/09/13/changing-background-syncd-with-jqueryui-tabs/ but the background image changes like 1second after, is there a way to avoid this? Make it change at the same time?
[09:29:53] <Eviltwin> Sorry, var timer; $(window).keypress(function(){clearTimeout(timer); timer = setTimeout(function() { ... }, 1000); })
[09:30:00] <Eviltwin> This is what I get for typing in a tiny IRC window
[09:31:15] <bitwise_> anyone know how to make the tooltip plugin not actually trigger the mouseout event on the element that triggers it (since the tooltip is overlapping the trigger element)
[09:31:41] <Ankabout> Eviltwin, I've gotten it a bit further..
[09:32:01] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/4am9g/9/ - I got it to shuffly from the first element to the second (so from item-first to the next one)
[09:32:14] <Ankabout> how do I loop through each element, and then go back to the first, etc.?
[09:32:27] <daevski> Eviltwin, do I need to do $(window) or can I use the input field they are using?
[09:32:31] <Ankabout> I don't think I understand enough of jquery looping to get that working
[09:33:46] <Eviltwin> daevski: I think you might need window
[09:34:03] <daevski> Eviltwin, kk, just didn't understand it, but thank you.
[09:34:12] <crowemi> Eviltwin: JSLint gives me all sorts of errors, mainly because this is a snippet of larger file. I tried to clean up the code in pastebin? is there anything obviously wrong that I'm missing? I think script stops executing at the jQuery.append(). http://pastebin.com/vYQAGDbr
[09:35:39] <daevski> Eviltwin, also, can I declare timer like so? $('input#to').keyup(function(){timer = setTimeout(function(e){ ....
[09:35:57] <crowemi> Eviltwin: The weird part is, it executes the append() properly but wont execute any of the code following the loop.
[09:36:34] <Eviltwin> daevski: You mean without a var outside and without the clearTimeout?
[09:36:51] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: have you looked at docs for .each() ?
[09:37:00] <Eviltwin> crowemi: I suggest looking at .tmpl
[09:37:04] <Eviltwin> ? .tmpl @ crowemi
[09:37:05] <bot-t> crowemi, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[09:37:12] <twisted`> hi, in IE8/IE9 my autocomplete doesn't work. The datasource is a JSON array generated by json_encode. It looks exactly the same as the examples online from the jqueryui docs. Yet somehow it doesn't work. When I use a JS Array inside the function the autocomplete works in IE8/IE9
[09:37:17] <twisted`> any ideas?
[09:37:24] <JonathanCutrell> ? .each @ ankabout
[09:37:24] <bot-t> ankabout, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:37:26] <daevski> Eviltwin, no sir, I decalre it first and use clear, but after that.
[09:37:51] <crowemi> Eviltwin: thank you, I'll investigate further!
[09:38:25] <daevski> Eviltwin, like so: http://jsfiddle.net/uD2L5/
[09:39:09] <Ankabout> JonathanCutrell, I have, but I haven't been able to translate it to my situation...
[09:39:18] <Ankabout> I'm actually still on that page
[09:39:18] <daevski> Eviltwin, looks like no. the js is not valid :)
[09:39:19] <Ankabout> hehe
[09:39:19] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: explain your situation.
[09:39:41] <Eviltwin> daevski: Why do you have two event handlers inside each other?
[09:39:51] <Ankabout> JonathanCutrell: http://jsfiddle.net/4am9g/9/
[09:40:07] <Ankabout> basically I have a bunch of elements, and all but the first are hidden by css
[09:40:16] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: right
[09:40:21] <Ankabout> the first should be populated in a loop with the text from its siblings, one by one
[09:40:48] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: so just a carousel?
[09:40:53] <JonathanCutrell> of sorts*?
[09:40:54] <Ankabout> pretty much
[09:41:02] <daevski> Eviltwin, I'm not sure what you mean. Sorry, kinda new.
[09:41:17] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: gotcha. well, do you know where it's stopping?
[09:41:50] <Ankabout> JonathanCutrell, well what I've figured out with my limites jquery is how to use the text of the second after the first one, but that's all
[09:42:03] <Ankabout> there's no loop set up yet because I can't figure out how to do it.
[09:42:25] <Eviltwin> daevski: http://jsfiddle.net/uD2L5/1/ ?
[09:42:52] <Ankabout> JonathanCutrell, I thought there are two ways to do it (bothb of which I don't know how to do)
[09:43:03] <Ankabout> one is to put the stuff into an array, and then loop through the array
[09:43:04] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: so basically you'll want to set up a function that is set off with setTimeout() that is recursive.
[09:43:17] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: or just calls itself at the end.
[09:43:22] <Ankabout> or to just loop through the elements directly without the array
[09:43:33] <daevski> Eviltwin, I don't know what you're asking. Where is the problem? I was asking if I can set a value (keyTimer) within the function.
[09:44:00] <Eviltwin> daevski: http://jsfiddle.net/PPNBW/1/
[09:44:01] <daevski> Eviltwin, but when I do, the JS is not valid, so that answers that, haha.
[09:44:07] <bot-t> Ankabout, Sequentially chain your callbacks in jQuery  Three ways  Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[09:44:51] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: Yea, what bot-t said.
[09:44:53] <Eviltwin> daevski: All functions get the same scope as their parents
[09:45:14] <Eviltwin> daevski: So as long as you've defined a variable somewhere outside the function
[09:45:29] <Eviltwin> Yow will have access to it
[09:46:48] <Ankabout> JonathanCutrell, thanks, lemme have a look if I can get that into my skull
[09:46:54] <daevski> Eviltwin, I see now. It works very well. Thanks for your patience. And sorry I got confused, haha.
[09:46:55] <dalgard> hey. just wanting to be sure - with $.getScript does the callback ('success') gets executed only after the script has been downloaded AND executed? that is, can I be sure it has finished executing?
[09:48:54] <Eviltwin> dalgard: Pretty sure it is after execution, it uses the load event
[09:49:20] <dalgard> can anyone else confirm? :)
[09:49:23] <dalgard> (thx)
[09:52:36] <Ankabout> JonathanCutrell, what did I do wrong here with using that example? http://jsfiddle.net/4am9g/10/
[09:52:45] <Ankabout> should be in the first 4 lines of js
[09:54:12] <dalgard> btw, what is the best way to test wether something is a jQuery object?
[09:55:34] <Nicolas_Leonidas> what is the best html attribute you can use to store values that you will use later by javascript, is "role" a goo done?
[09:55:37] <Nicolas_Leonidas> what is the best html attribute you can use to store values that you will use later by javascript, is "role" a goo done?
[09:55:48] <Nicolas_Leonidas> good one*
[09:57:00] <Prash7> S'all good guys, Prash is here
[09:57:41] <Woet> Prash7: didn't notice a difference.
[09:57:42] <erichynds> Nicolas_Leonidas: data-* attributes
[09:58:24] <Nicolas_Leonidas> erichynds: the html 5 data attributes?
[09:58:29] <erichynds> yaaaap
[09:58:37] <Nicolas_Leonidas> erichynds: that's a good idea, thanks
[09:58:43] <Prash7> Woet, it's all good. Some peolpe get it, some don't.
[09:59:24] <Bower^> Nicolas_Leonidas, I personally just wrap my code in an anonymous function then you can have variables that are only scoped to that function and not the global scope
[09:59:34] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: looks like there may be something wrong with the shuffleLetters plugin
[09:59:44] <Bower^> Attaching JS data to html elements seems strange
[09:59:45] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: I'm working with it for a few minutes
[09:59:52] <Ankabout> JonathanCutrell, nah that works perfectly if I don't use the looping thing
[10:00:12] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: I'm staring at an error right now.
[10:00:20] <Ankabout> oh really? oops
[10:00:28] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: after the comment line "//The animation is complete. Updating the…"
[10:00:50] <smftre> How can I change this to use jquery selectors, I want to replace the innerHTML stuff... for(var i=0; i<document.getElementsByName("countdownitema").length; i++) {        document.getElementsByName("countdownitemb")[i].innerHTML = time_from_seconds(parseInt(document.getElementsByName("countdownitema")[i].innerHTML));       }
[10:01:21] <Woet> smftre: .. by changing it to jquery selectors?
[10:01:40] <smftre> Woet: not sure how to do it, I need to run a .each() right?
[10:02:05] <Woet> smftre: seems like it
[10:02:05] <Bower^> You can still use the traditional for
[10:02:28] <Woet> it's indeed not required, but would be better :)
[10:02:41] <Ankabout> JonathanCutrell, since it does shuffle for me, is it maybe the part that's supposed to make the callback work that's not working?
[10:03:00] <CannedCorn> how would one get typing the @ symbol to trigger an autocomplete like twitter?
[10:03:26] <Ankabout> JonathanCutrell, this shuffle works fine for me, but doesn't loop op course: http://jsfiddle.net/4am9g/11/
[10:03:59] <webPragmatist> Brodingo: how the heck are you getting it to size the same as the content?

[10:04:24] <steffen> Hi there. Still having the problem to get the .val() of a modal dialog with the id="user". The normal approach user=$('#user').val(); fails, is this a dialog-box issue?
[10:04:41] <Brodingo> webPragmatist either set the dimensions on the element or in the colorbox options
[10:04:49] <smftre> erichynds: thanks

[10:06:18] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: do you need this to only go through once or loop back around?
[10:06:28] <Brodingo> steffen val is for inputs
[10:06:32] <Brodingo> use .html()
[10:06:34] <Ankabout> it needs to loop around
[10:06:49] <JonathanCutrell> Ankabout: okay - gimme a sec
[10:06:53] <daevski> Eviltwin, still around? How can I get it to only wait on default within this switch? http://jsfiddle.net/eqE5Z/
[10:07:00] <steffen> Brodingo: THX, I check this out
[10:07:06] <Ankabout> JonathanCutrell, I just updated the jfiddle to be sure it has the LATEST version of the plugin
[10:07:23] <Ankabout> it was updated 10 sept, and I'm not sure if I copied it after. I think I did, as that is when he added the callback option
[10:07:48] <steffen> Brodingo: sorry, it is a input type text element, sorry.
[10:08:15] <steffen> Brodingo: the .val() thing should be the right one, really.
[10:08:20] <Bower^> CannedCorn, do you want it to trigger when a specific text-area is in focus or just anywhere on the page?
[10:08:54] <Brodingo> steffen post your code
[10:08:56] <steffen> Brodingo: user = $('input:text[name=user]').val(); does not work either
[10:09:02] <CannedCorn> Bower: when a specific test area is in focus
[10:09:09] <CannedCorn> Bower^: ^^
[10:09:14] <daevski> Eviltwin, Nevermind :) I got it.
[10:09:37] <Bower^> CannedCorn, k. I'm just trying to find out how to get which key was pressed
[10:10:05] <steffen> Brodingo: http://handball.ws/melder.html it's plain html with a python cgi ajax-backend, so you can check my code with a peek in the source.
[10:10:39] <safzouf> Hi!
[10:10:55] <safzouf> how to get the clicked object inside the function?
[10:11:03] <safzouf> means
[10:11:13] <Brodingo> oh my
[10:11:18] <steffen> Brodingo: a klick on the door opens the dialog.
[10:11:21] <safzouf> if I click on "a", this executes a function
[10:11:23] <panfist> i'm trying to use jquery in a greasemonkey script to automate a status check that i frequently do. first the script opens a new window, which loads a document that's made of some nested frames, and i'm having a hard time getting a proper $(document).ready() for documents nested in the new window
[10:11:32] <safzouf> how we can get the clicked "a" inside the funtion?
[10:11:39] <webPragmatist> can i get the computed outerWidth without the element having to be shown?
[10:11:45] <steffen> Brodingo: I just started with jquery ;-)
[10:11:58] <crowemi> Eviltwin: That .tmpl works wonders! Thank you for all your help!!
[10:11:59] <Brodingo> so i see
[10:12:18] <steffen> lol
[10:12:56] <webPragmatist> actually that makes no sense
[10:12:57] <panfist> i've tried stuff like $(child_window.document).ready( function () { $(child_window.frames[1].document).ready( foo ) } )
[10:13:08] <panfist> but it seems like foo is still being called before all the frames are really ready
[10:13:09] <webPragmatist> Brodingo: what happens if you don't know the width and height… this is an epically frustrating problem
[10:13:55] <steffen> Brodingo: I need the login data (username/pass) to check it back with an ajax call, set some cookies and stuff, but now I got stuck.
[10:14:46] <Brodingo> dear god
[10:15:10] <steffen> The intresting 2 parts are the function login() and functiion modallogin()
[10:15:45] <yogurt_truck> is there an event for when a jquery UI dialog has just been created?
[10:15:58] <smftre> if I run $("nameOfElement").html(function(i){alert("trigger");}); will the alert every run? or rather, will it run for all the elements? does .html() on a name selector do a loop?
[10:16:04] <Brodingo> you should really only try to have one doc ready function, limit the number of globals, and for the love of god dont use inline handlers
[10:16:38] <Brodingo> in an inline handler 'this' is the window
[10:16:46] <Brodingo> i believe
[10:17:56] <steffen> Brodingo: this statements were only for testing purposes. I get the onblur value in an alert box, but can't pass it to a global.
[10:18:03] <Elephant> like "onClick"?
[10:18:12] <Nicolas_Leonidas> is there an event for when the object is shown?
[10:18:32] <ChampS_> $('#formatbutton select').live('change', function(first, second, third) { <<< is that possible?
[10:18:49] <Elephant> what about <table><tr><td><table><tr><tr><table width=valign><iframe src=lol>
[10:18:49] <Woet> ChampS_: did you try it?
[10:18:50] <ChampS_> or how i can use more then one parameter?
[10:18:54] <Prash7> Nicolas_Leonidas what do you mean? like when an object is not hidden by CSS or something?
[10:18:58] <Woet> Elephant: table? iframe?!

[10:27:44] <Bower^> CannedCorn, sorry for the delay. I'm just having a play now. Well this is more tricky than I initially thought. You would normally just detect which key was pressed using the keyCode value but the @ symbol doesn't seem to have one. You need to attach a keyUp() function to the respective element and have that read the last char in the text.
[10:29:06] <CannedCorn> Bower^ thanks man, ok so if i did autocomplete at that point and the user made a selection, how would i go about styling the text of his selection
[10:31:15] <Bower^> What do you mean? Bit too abstract, what exactly are you doing?
[10:31:20] <Bower^> and brb, coffee
[10:45:05] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[10:45:10] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use templates?
[10:47:35] <enjoycrf> figure it out lol
[10:47:40] <ProLoser|Work> I'm getting this error: [object HTMLInputElement]
[10:47:46] <ProLoser|Work> i'm not sure why, the variable isn't even present
[10:48:07] <ProLoser|Work> if i do ${title} and it is empty or doesn't exist shouldn't it just degrade?
[10:48:36] <scratcha> hey guys, ive written a simple getJSON call, but i want to add a loading.gif into my code. i can show the loading image on the first line, but i need to hide it when the getJSON asynchronous call completes. any advice? heres my json call http://pastie.org/2564128
[10:51:03] <Bower^> scratcha, just give the <img> element an id and have the callback function call $('#imageID').hide();
[10:51:18] <scratcha> whats the callback function though?
[10:51:35] <scratcha> does getJSON have some callback on complete?
[10:52:44] <Bower^> Yeah. $.getJSON('url', {params}, function(jsonData){});
[10:53:15] <scratcha> just got it, thanks
[10:53:23] <Bower^> np
[10:53:44] <ProLoser|Work> any ideas why my templates are rendering [object HTMLInputElement] instead of just leaving the values blank?

[11:01:56] <s34n> Is there a way to make an existing element within a dialog <div> be the title?
[11:03:19] <ProLoser|Work> if i use a template variable, and it doesn't have data, should it error out?
[11:06:11] <clarkbox> ProLoser
[11:06:15] <clarkbox> what code produces that?

[11:07:59] <ProLoser|Work> http://pastebin.com/LHTGQsz5
[11:08:20] <ProLoser|Work> it's spitting it out fro description and title, but not for anything else
[11:08:22] <Brodingo> i dont know anything about gzip
[11:08:28] <ProLoser|Work> the template has not had any data passed to it
[11:10:17] <s34n> supsup: \s ?
[11:11:31] <clarkbox> what is title
[11:11:37] <clarkbox> do title.val()
[11:11:46] <Prash7> think its the title of the page
[11:11:48] <Prash7> could be wrong tho
[11:12:00] <clarkbox> is it supposed to be a string
[11:12:11] <clarkbox> or is it a selector/element
[11:12:30] <ProLoser|Work> title doesn't exist
[11:12:33] <Prash7> ^^
[11:12:38] <ProLoser|Work> my point is why isn't the template degrading?
[11:12:49] <clarkbox> its calling to string on whatever you give it
[11:12:50] <ProLoser|Work> do i really have to check the existence of every var before echoing it into the template?
[11:12:58] <ProLoser|Work> but i didn't give it anything
[11:13:01] <ProLoser|Work> i passed no data
[11:13:03] <clarkbox> you give it an object its going to puke
[11:13:09] <ProLoser|Work> so why some of them work and some don't is beyond me
[11:13:16] <ProLoser|Work> i didn't give it anything
[11:13:24] <clarkbox> try <script>alert(${title})</script>
[11:13:32] <ProLoser|Work> in the template?
[11:13:35] <clarkbox> ya
[11:13:51] <ProLoser|Work> didn't realize i could do that
[11:14:03] <clarkbox> wait
[11:14:05] <clarkbox> thats no good
[11:14:15] <brandonmerritt> i have a really basic question about click()
[11:14:40] <clarkbox> dont wrap it in $()
[11:14:46] <brandonmerritt> if i want to add a class to the clicked item and then do something to every item that is not() the clicked item
[11:14:49] <clarkbox> nevermind
[11:14:50] <brandonmerritt> how would i go about it?
[11:14:51] <brandonmerritt> http://jsfiddle.net/brandonmerritt/sFkAa/
[11:15:13] <ProLoser|Work> clarkbox: which is it?

[11:16:20] <clarkbox> not sure if that alert will be in the same context
[11:16:28] <clarkbox> of title in the template
[11:16:57] <clarkbox> can you put up your JS code
[11:17:06] <clarkbox> at least the relevant part
[11:17:25] <ProLoser|Work> one sec
[11:17:30] <ProLoser|Work> <script> seems to break things
[11:18:06] <clarkbox> <script>alert('asd')</script>
[11:18:11] <ProLoser|Work> it's echoiing it out
[11:18:13] <clarkbox> ya i think i dont know what im doing
[11:18:22] <clarkbox> echoing what?
[11:18:31] <ProLoser|Work> alert('tst')
[11:18:36] <clarkbox> but title breaks
[11:18:41] <clarkbox> thats what i figured
[11:19:14] <clarkbox> need to see your JS
[11:19:21] <clarkbox> need to see what 'title' is
[11:19:38] <supsup> anyone know why the first one does not work in these two examples using replace?  http://jsfiddle.net/xpCjQ/

[11:21:50] <muley> hey so is there an easy way to tell if the document within an iframe has been resized?
[11:22:03] <t0th> isnt correct
[11:22:17] <muley> i tried $(window).resize(...) in the iframe, but it doesnt change because the iframe window isnt changing height
[11:22:19] <muley> just it's contents
[11:22:27] <Aquaguy> Hey there!
[11:22:50] <danzik17> muley: Rather than the window, maybe try window.document.body
[11:23:21] <muley> i thought only window fired resize? will test...
[11:23:51] <Aquaguy> is there any built in method that retunes all the siblings previous to a selected items? $(foo).previousSiblings()
[11:23:58] <muley> danzik17: yeah.. no luck
[11:24:18] <danzik17> muley: Ah, too bad.  Worth a shot (didn't know if it'd work).

[11:39:53] <Solow> Okay. This plugin has an "addMethod" method, which's second argument is the error message. I want to build a dynamic async validator, which will decide what the message is upon response, meaning I don't know the error message when adding the validation method. My question is: is it possible to define the error message inside of the validator callback?

[12:44:15] <jugstah> make a function and apply it to a if/then and a .clicked event?

[12:51:42] <kinga> hey, if i insert HTML content (with jquery's .html() function which utilizes .innerHTML) an input which has onclick='something()', will the function be bind on the event ?
[12:51:57] <kinga> or do i have to use specific methods ( $.bind() ) ?
[12:52:36] <Brodingo> dont use inline handlers
[12:52:45] <smftre> does anyone know how to make InternetExplorer refresh it's DOM and be aware of the new items after an ajax insert?
[13:06:51] <dabear> ?live @ smftre
[13:06:51] <bot-t> smftre, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:07:53] <smftre> dabear: say what?
[13:08:15] <b1indMoe> smftre: that is the answer to your question
[13:08:19] <jeffsmykil> has anyone seen a bug where in safari (not chrome) the background-image gets cut off?
[13:08:36] <smftre> oh
[13:08:39] <b1indMoe> smftre: $.delegate() is worth looking at as well
[13:10:14] <kinga> does any1 know why my json string (received from server as ajax response) which only has 1 variable (a string) is not parsed correctly from json?
[13:10:20] <kinga> even when i use dataType: json
[13:10:26] <smftre> dabear: b1indMoe: so I would do something like: $("#rootParentOfAllElements").live("update", function(e){});   ?
[13:11:02] <kinga> the string is called "html" and when i alert it using response.html it gives me undefined
[13:11:28] <kinga> isn't the response automatically parsed from json ?
[13:11:38] <dabear> ?tias @ smftre
[13:11:38] <bot-t> smftre, Try It And See
[13:11:56] <b1indMoe> kinga: I believe you can force jquery to parse the response as json
[13:12:07] <b1indMoe> ?ajax
[13:12:07] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:12:14] <kinga> i know
[13:12:18] <kinga> i just said i used dataType: json
[13:12:20] <dabear> smftre: hmm, you just use a selector that would match the elements
[13:12:23] <dabear> not the root
[13:12:25] <kinga> dataType: 'json' *
[13:12:31] <b1indMoe> ahh didn't see that
[13:12:46] <b1indMoe> kinga: did you go the proper route and debug the data that is being sent back
[13:12:49] <Brodingo> kinga are you using the callback
[13:13:04] <dabear> smftre: that is the difference between .bind( and click etc) and .live
[13:13:08] <kinga> complete( function(response){})
[13:13:19] <smftre> dabear: right
[13:13:45] <Brodingo> mmhmm well kinga if you post some code i bet people would be willing to look at it
[13:13:52] <kinga> ok, i will, hold on :)
[13:14:00] <ProLoser|Work> if callbacks are required (or more important than an options map) should i make the callback come before the options in the method params?
[13:14:08] <kinga> i have google chromium and i can see that the data is being sent
[13:14:11] <kinga> and received
[13:14:30] <b1indMoe> when you pastebin your code.. also pastebin the response you are getting
[13:14:35] <kinga> in the javascript console
[13:17:13] <ChampS_> if i save vars in a click event and trigger a change event in the click event, can i commit this vars in the change event?
[13:20:28] <kinga> http://pastebin.com/cdpNxF3t
[13:20:31] <kinga> this is it
[13:20:49] <ChampS_> if i save vars in a click event and trigger a change event in the click event, can i commit this vars in the change event?
[13:21:33] <erichynds> ?tias @ ChampS_
[13:21:33] <bot-t> ChampS_, Try It And See
[13:22:13] <ChampS_> HOW ^^
[13:22:16] <ChampS_> thats the question
[13:22:34] <erichynds> what do you mean by commit this vars
[13:22:48] <ChampS_> http://pastebin.com/ZdqqWD2H
[13:22:50] <ChampS_> here
[13:22:52] <ChampS_> u see
[13:23:06] <ChampS_> first second and third are the vars
[13:23:13] <erichynds> the answer is yes
[13:23:17] <erichynds> but you don't want to be doing that
[13:23:25] <erichynds> each click of the li binds a new listener
[13:23:31] <ChampS_> i want :p
[13:23:33] <ChampS_> yes
[13:23:35] <erichynds> kk
[13:24:05] <kinga> blindMoe, http://pastebin.com/cdpNxF3t here's the pastebin
[13:24:09] <ChampS_> but how that version dont work
[13:24:09] <erichynds> tias was still applicable in this casse
[13:24:22] <ChampS_> function(first, second, third)
[13:24:25] <erichynds> ChampS_: remove that
[13:24:26] <ChampS_> thats not right
[13:24:31] <erichynds> it should just be function()
[13:24:37] <ChampS_> kk
[13:25:31] <ChampS_> but whats the right way?
[13:26:17] <lacrymology> I'm trying to $.get() a file from another site, and it's failing with XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://yp.shoutcast.com/sbin/tunein-station.pls?id=1274344. Origin http://localhost:8000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. how can I work around this?
[13:28:01] <ChampS_> mh ^^
[13:28:33] <kinga> can some1 help me with my problem :( ? i copy pasted the link from pastebin
[13:28:43] <kinga> the problem is that response.html is undefined
[13:29:42] <erichynds> kinga: does your JSON pass @ jsonlint.com?
[13:30:09] <Bower^> lacrymology, the same origin policy doesn't allow you to get stuff from a domain other than your own excluding some referenced from certain elements such as <img> and <script>. I don't think there's much you can do
[13:30:42] <erichynds> lacrymology: use a proxy
[13:30:49] <kinga> erichynds, yep it does
[13:30:51] <erichynds> ?g ben alman php proxy @ lacrymology
[13:30:52] <bot-t> lacrymology, Ben Alman  Simple PHP Proxy: JavaScript finally "gets" cross ... - http://benalman.com/projects/php-simple-proxy/
[13:30:59] <kinga> it's escaped properly
[13:31:12] <kinga> from PHP's function json_encode();
[13:31:17] <erichynds> kinga: console.log(response); and see what the object looks like
[13:31:27] <erichynds> using firebug, chrome inspector, etc.
[13:31:41] <sphinxxx> how do i listen for someone to drag something onto a <div> using html5
[13:31:49] <sphinxxx> for example an image from their desktop
[13:32:08] <pputman> anyone have any suggestions on some sites that have javascript/jquery projects to learn?
[13:32:38] <erichynds> pputman: you'd bind an ondrop listener to the target div
[13:32:59] <pputman> wrong person ;)
[13:33:11] <erichynds> OOPS
[13:33:14] <erichynds> sphinxxx ^
[13:33:26] <Brodingo> kinga are you using data where you should be using url?
[13:33:33] <erichynds> sphinxxx: http://html5demos.com/file-api
[13:33:40] <kinga> erichynds, ok i did, response: "{"html": "html string"}"
[13:33:46] <kinga> responseText the same as response
[13:33:50] <kinga> responseType: ""
[13:34:18] <erichynds> kinga: that might be the response from the server, but that's not what the response is in your complete handler
[13:34:31] <erichynds> it should be a JS object
[13:34:44] <kinga> but i specified for $.ajax that it's json
[13:34:46] <erichynds> and you'll probably notice it doesn't have an "html" property
[13:35:02] <kinga> like dataType: 'json'
[13:35:04] <erichynds> i know that
[13:35:10] <erichynds> jquery parses the JSON for you
[13:35:29] <erichynds> "response" in the complete handler should be an object not a string
[13:35:33] <kinga> and it should create from the response a JS object which has 1 property, named html
[13:35:43] <erichynds> that is what I'm trying to help you debug
[13:36:41] <manouch> d
[13:36:45] <kinga> i know it should be an object
[13:36:49] <manouch> sorry
[13:36:55] <kinga> that's why i am treating as an object
[13:37:05] <kinga> hence, i used response.html
[13:37:18] <erichynds> bro
[13:37:31] <erichynds> console.log(response) in your complete handler, open up firebug, and inspect the obejct
[13:38:10] <manouch> when i do this.options.map(function(value) { return Config.image_options[value].option }) an empty array is returned
[13:38:25] <manouch> when i want to call its "join" method... i get a type error
[13:38:31] <bitwise_> I tried to ask this earlier, but it required a full thread: http://flowplayer.org/tools/forum/30/75649. any help would be appreciated
[13:38:45] <erichynds> manouch: assuming this.options is a jquery object, you need to call .get() after that
[13:38:48] <kinga> i have chromium and using the built in javascript console
[13:38:48] <manouch> $.map([], function(value) { return value; }).join(",") <--- that works fine
[13:38:52] <erichynds> if it's not, then you want $.map
[13:39:26] <manouch> ahh... great
[13:39:29] <manouch> thank you very much
[13:41:15] <kinga> erichynds, http://img339.imageshack.us/img339/842/screenshot7cp.png this is what i get
[13:42:04] <erichynds> kinga: that is not what i told you to do
[13:42:31] <kinga> but i don't understand what are you trying to say :( "in my complete handler"
[13:42:46] <kinga> you mean in complete: function(response){} ?
[13:42:48] <kinga> here?
[13:42:59] <erichynds> yes
[13:43:00] <kinga> in the unnamed function from complete
[13:43:25] <kinga> well...i used console.log right in the body of the unnamed function
[13:44:31] <erichynds> it looks like your key is string, not html
[13:44:33] <erichynds> response.string
[13:44:56] <kinga> yea, thats cuz i changed it
[13:45:00] <kinga> just changed it everywhere
[13:45:06] <kinga> so it's no difference
[13:46:38] <Lundy> Heya guys iv got a peice of code where in a PHP while I have it echoing something like "<button id="edit_package">" then after that I have $('#edit_package').click(function(){
[13:47:02] <kinga> so...it's pretty weird :( i don't know why is it undefined
[13:47:02] <Lundy> only problem im having is if I have two or more of them It will not work for the second or more ... how can I fix this
[13:47:11] <kinga> should i change the dataType to text and then parse it manually?
[13:47:12] <Brodingo> Lundy use classes
[13:47:38] <kinga> manually as in using the jquery's parse function
[13:48:22] <SkroMa`a> What about this page friends.. ---> http://ihjalp.se/drupal6/
[13:49:22] <Ankabout> is there a reason why this wouldn't work?  $(".item-current").text() = "my string";
[13:51:16] <sphinxxx> whats the best jquery ajax file upload plugin, REALLY simple, i don't need multiple file uploading or anything
[13:51:43] <Brodingo> kinga maybe you should be using success instead of complete
[13:52:16] <kinga> hmm...or i can use response.response
[13:52:27] <kinga> i just noticed this is the json string
[13:52:30] <kinga> where it resides
[13:52:52] <dabear> Ankabout: assigning a string to a result of a method call is invalid. this is unrelated to jquery, it is generally wrong
[13:52:57] <dabear> learn javascript @:)
[13:52:58] <Brodingo> thats because youre inspecting the jqxhr object
[13:53:06] <Ankabout> dabear, I just saw, it's wrong
[13:53:13] <Brodingo> not the data returned from the success function
[13:53:17] <Ankabout> I nead $(elemet).text("string");
[13:53:19] <Ankabout> thanks
[13:54:25] <kinga> Brodingo, i know :) but i didn't have to do that before
[13:54:36] <Brodingo> before what
[13:55:03] <kinga> i'm using success on all my ajax requests
[13:55:09] <kinga> complete*
[13:55:11] <kinga> instead of success
[13:55:30] <Brodingo> and why is that
[13:55:57] <kinga> because i wan't everything to be executed after everything else is done in the request
[13:56:06] <kinga> success is before complete
[13:56:07] <kinga> right ?
[13:56:10] <Brodingo> yes
[13:56:15] <kinga> i want*
[13:58:25] <kinga> nop, using html to add elements with events won't work
[13:59:02] <kinga> >.<... is there a way to "evaluate" a html? so it won't just "copy paste" but actually add it to the dom hierarchy ?
[13:59:18] <kinga> and attach any events an element might have
[13:59:35] <kinga> in the html string that i'm trying to insert into the document
[14:00:08] <Brodingo> ?delegate
[14:00:09] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:00:25] <ProLoser|Work> do template variables persist across templates?
[14:01:06] <kinga> ah sweet, thanks Brodingo :)
[14:01:12] <kinga> that will save me a lot of work
[14:04:50] <Ankabout> this is a correct way to replace the text in an element right? $(".my-element"_.text("string");
[14:04:54] <Ankabout> or is there something wrong with that?
[14:05:05] <Ankabout> _ is a typo :)
[14:05:33] <kinga> Brodingo, i have a question just to be sure, in .delegate( selector, eventType, eventData, handler ) if i want to use "handler" with parameters, will i specify them in eventData object?
[14:06:19] <kinga> ah, he just left lol... could someone clarify this to me :) ?
[14:06:48] <mbroadst> I've got a click handler for a table, when a cell is clicked I assign "selected_row" to $(event.target.parentNode), and that works just fine. when I tried to access the childNodes of that variable however, it says thats undefined, when there are clearly many siblings when I check it out in dev tools. where am I going wrong here?
[14:07:45] <mbroadst> realistically I just want to grab the nth child of that object (2nd in this case)
[14:07:50] <Ankabout> can you leave messages for people with a bot in here?
[14:13:05] <kinga> well html() works, it 'evaluates' the string and i see the attached events working
[14:13:48] <mbroadst> when I call addClass on that object, it works just fine, when I call childNodes I get a null response
[14:15:04] <MadonnaIsSoHot> Why can't I use sizzleJS instead of jQrash?
[14:16:46] <vlt> Hello. How can I select an element with id="element[1]"?
[14:17:12] <vlt> $('#element[1]') doesn't work
[14:17:39] <vlt> Maybe the "[]" is not allowed?
[14:18:45] <Ankabout> does anyone know if I can leave messages for people with a bot in this channel?
[14:19:07] <Aristata1> How can I prevent $.get from returning before the data has arrived?
[14:19:55] <Dave_Stein> Aristata1: async false, but that's a bad option to use
[14:20:24] <Aristata1> well, I can't continue without the data
[14:20:29] <Aristata1> what other option do I have
[14:20:39] <dalgard> hi. does jquery have a method like find that also searches the elements in the current collection - that is, not just their descendants?
[14:20:40] <Dave_Stein> remove all the code after $.get, put it in a callback function
[14:20:54] <Dave_Stein> dalgard how was the collection made?
[14:21:25] <dalgard> $().add(elem).add(elem)
[14:21:44] <Aristata1> Dave_stien a callback on the get function? How would I go about that? Willl I still have access to the data returned?
[14:21:58] <dalgard> (collecting elements for manipulation, don't want to go through the whole document
[14:22:00] <dalgard> )
[14:22:08] <Dave_Stein> dalgard got it one sec i think i know the answer i just wanna double check
[14:22:12] <Aristata1> .get(/path, function(data){})
[14:22:18] <Dave_Stein> ?get @ Aristata1
[14:22:18] <bot-t> Aristata1, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[14:22:27] <Dave_Stein> ugh not that one
[14:22:41] <dalgard> blasted :)
[14:22:46] <Aristata1> Dave_Stein:  there is nothing about callbacks in there I have read it
[14:23:05] <Aristata1> oh nm
[14:23:09] <Dave_Stein> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[14:23:11] <Dave_Stein> success callback
[14:23:20] <dalgard> (exactly)
[14:24:19] <Dave_Stein> dalgard filter is the answer
[14:24:26] <Dave_Stein> ?filter @ dalgard
[14:24:26] <bot-t> dalgard, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:24:44] <Dave_Stein> var $x = $('#checkout_ship_address_1'); $x = $x.add( $('#checkout_bill_address_1') ); $x.filter( $('#checkout_ship_address_1') );
[14:24:48] <dalgard> yeah, but it doesn't search the descendants, does it?
[14:24:52] <Aristata1> Dave_Stein:  This is my code. http://pastie.org/private/qzwjgvgfgpmnk7qurjjda It is still logging [] and returning without the data returning
[14:25:25] <Dave_Stein> dalgard whoops i gotcha now... youd need to each through the collection and do find, i dont think there's a magic function for that
[14:25:58] <Dave_Stein> Aristata1: that function with nothing in it is the success callback, the other function is fake
[14:26:03] <gnarf> dalgard: .find ?
[14:26:09] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: ^^
[14:26:18] <dalgard> it's like ... if I could only wrap all my fragments in a block and then do a find on that block... except I cant, cause I want to keep them in the document
[14:26:37] <dalgard> find only searches descendants, not the collection itself
[14:26:39] <Aristata1> Dave_Stein:  that's were I has the stuff in before
[14:26:49] <gnarf> dalgard: .filter
[14:26:57] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: you are going in same order I did ;)
[14:27:03] <Dave_Stein> Aristata1 if its not valid JSON from server it wont work either
[14:27:07] <dalgard> you mean .filter(function)?
[14:27:10] <gnarf> dalgard: describe the EXACT behavior you want
[14:27:53] <Aristata1> Dave_Stein:  it's very valid
[14:27:57] <dalgard> I have a collection of elements. I would like to get all elements that matches a selector - from the collection AS well as from the descendants of each member
[14:28:13] <Dave_Stein> did you console log the data from the callback?
[14:28:20] <gnarf> dalgard: collection.find( selector ).andSelf().filter( selector );
[14:28:48] <gnarf> hold on tho
[14:28:49] <gnarf> ?andSelf
[14:28:50] <bot-t> .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[14:29:01] <gnarf> nvm
[14:29:09] <gnarf> there was some talk of adding a selector to andSelf
[14:29:16] <dalgard> hmm
[14:29:21] <gnarf> you could make it a little less intense
[14:29:22] <gnarf> by doing
[14:29:37] <gnarf> collection.find( selector ).add( collection.filter( selector ) )
[14:29:48] <gnarf> that way it doesn't have to filter the ones it knows it has
[14:29:53] <dalgard> I mean, I CAN do it different ways, I was just thinking there had to be one method for it. seems quite trivial
[14:30:09] <Dave_Stein> gnarf that answer is a good one :)
[14:30:12] <gnarf> dalgard: nope - thats not something you need to do very often
[14:30:19] <Dave_Stein> dalgard i've never needed that ever
[14:30:22] <dalgard> darn
[14:30:43] <Dave_Stein> dalgard i have a website written in JS that builds websites and I haven't needed it heh
[14:30:46] <dalgard> me neither, now it just seems so obivious ... I'm sure you've experienced something similar ;)
[14:31:07] <dalgard> haha "obivious" - right on
[14:31:28] <gnarf> halfway between obvious and oblivious?
[14:31:42] <dalgard> more to the oblivious side I think
[14:31:51] <Dave_Stein> gnarf what's your twtitter name if ya have one you always cut in when im answering haha
[14:31:52] <brandonmerritt> would anybody mind helping me optimize this?
[14:31:54] <brandonmerritt> http://jsfiddle.net/brandonmerritt/eXYwy/
[14:31:58] <Dave_Stein> Aristata1 did you check with consoel log yet?
[14:32:06] <gnarf> @gnarf37 / tweets/githubs
[14:32:29] <brandonmerritt> i'm trying to create a function from the common variables, but it's not working
[14:32:37] <brandonmerritt> the function works great, it's just ugly
[14:32:42] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: You just happen to be answering when i decide to read the channel ;)
[14:33:22] <Dave_Stein> brandonmerritt you can encapsulate some variables inside a function that then does hover, but with things saved off
[14:33:41] <gnarf> brandonmerritt: You're not caching selections either - thats a big performance tip / code orginization
[14:33:43] <Dave_Stein> like inside your function save off $('.job') as jobs
[14:33:44] <dalgard> brandonmerritt: I think you should try to do the thing with only css and toggling classes!
[14:34:01] <Dave_Stein> and you can save off each anon function so that line of toggle won't be so unreadable
[14:34:35] <Dave_Stein> ha we were on same page that time gnarf. btw ive been talkin to scott gonzalez and ive rewritten draggable basic functionality from scratch in hopes of getting 2.0 moving. hes supposed to get me onto git cause im a git noob tho ;)
[14:34:42] <MadonnaIsSoHot> I can't code. :<
[14:34:48] <MadonnaIsSoHot> I am so distracted
[14:34:51] <Dave_Stein> gnarf just noticed youre jquery ui team ha
[14:34:57] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: :)
[14:35:19] <gnarf> its all ajpiano's fault
[14:35:30] <brandonmerritt> Thanks Dave. it's actually a click rather than a hover, but i could swap classes just as easily
[14:35:30] <Dave_Stein> i got one piece of codeo n github once that was fresh and ive forgotten how to do that let alone branching jquery properly to put in my draggable code
[14:35:49] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: fork jquery ui / clone the repo / etc
[14:35:50] <brandonmerritt> Dave_Stein err i mean thanks
[14:35:55] <Dave_Stein> :)
[14:35:57] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: there is a really good writeup out there
[14:35:58] <firespeaker> how do I trigger a function upon creation of an element matching a certain selector?
[14:36:17] <Dave_Stein> gnarf scott already said he'd help me out so im waiting for him to have time for that + him telling me how good bad the rewrite is
[14:36:18] <gnarf> http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-jquery-bug-fixing-guide kinda has most of the hot points Dave_Stein
[14:36:25] <Dave_Stein> what do i get to blame ajpiano for
[14:36:27] <Dave_Stein> :)
[14:36:46] <Dave_Stein> thanks for article ill check it out at home
[14:36:46] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: if you submit a pull - you'll get responses from more than just scott ;)
[14:37:04] <Dave_Stein> so if i fork and then pull but the plugin isnt done yet, what happens?
[14:37:51] <Dave_Stein> cause i just did basic dragging for all positions + helper option + callbacks
[14:38:04] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: pull requests sit in a queue
[14:38:13] <gnarf> you can just label your pull as "for review please" or something
[14:38:15] <Dave_Stein> firespeaker don't you know when you're creating said element?
[14:38:23] <gnarf> list your known problems
[14:38:23] <dalgard> so anyway. this is my basic pattern: when the site has loaded I use a build function to manipulate its elements. I would now like to use the same function for newly inserted elements without having to apply it to the whole site again. does this seem a strange thing at all?
[14:38:48] <Dave_Stein> dalgard: no
[14:39:13] <Dave_Stein> dalgard: just add a context argument/option to your function so it will do $(x).find('elements').addStuff()
[14:39:25] <Dave_Stein> dalgard and if x isn't defined you can default it to body
[14:39:54] <dalgard> right, but I don't want to go through the whole page again...?
[14:40:06] <Dave_Stein> if x = #new_div it won't go through whole page
[14:40:26] <Dave_Stein> it will find #new_div which would be quite fast and then filter through that element
[14:41:26] <dalgard> now I'm dong build($('body')) upon load with the functions looking like this: build(elems) { elems.find("div").css ... }
[14:42:06] <Dave_Stein> dalgard that seems like what i mean
[14:42:06] <dalgard> then if I later do build($('div')) then it doesn't find the div, see!
[14:42:19] <Dave_Stein> well that example is bad cause youd be going to every div on the page
[14:42:26] <dalgard> cause $('div').find('div') doesn't find the div!
[14:42:27] <dalgard> :)
[14:43:06] <dalgard> yeah, actually I am doing build(already_existing_collection_of_inserted_content) ...
[14:43:07] <Eviltwin> What's the problem exactly?
[14:43:10] <Dave_Stein> well thats why I made my examplea function like .addStuff() so you can do elems.find('div').addStuff or $(div).addStuff
[14:43:23] <Dave_Stein> he wants to run something on whole page once, and then just a section later
[14:43:32] <dalgard> exactly
[14:43:46] <Dave_Stein> $.fn.addStuff = function()
[14:44:58] <MadonnaIsSoHot> I want Madonna to tattoo Javascript on my chest, bite me with her sharp teeth, scratch me, and force my head between her legs.
[14:45:11] <Dave_Stein> #wow
[14:45:25] <zanberdo> where the hell did that come from? nevermind, I don't want to know
[14:45:36] <ajpiano> it's sort of a running gag now, i guess
[14:46:14] <firespeaker> Dave_Stein: I do know when I'm creating them, but I'm dynamically creating other such elements that are indistinguishable from them, so if I tie e.g., .blur() to them after creation, the already created elements will get .blur() twice
[14:46:43] <Dave_Stein> wow ajpiano is silent. sees that. and then responsds instantly
[14:46:49] <Dave_Stein> i see why you hang in here now ;)
[14:47:09] <Dave_Stein> firespeaker it sounds like exactly what dalgard wants
[14:47:31] <dalgard> :)
[14:47:32] <Dave_Stein> firespeaker make a function that is called for proper elements on page load and then when you create new ones, call the function on them too
[14:47:41] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: sleep w/ one eye open
[14:47:42] <ajpiano> :D
[14:47:45] * firespeaker tries to find what dalgard was told
[14:48:15] <dalgard> firespeaker you don't have too look through it, I'm still figuring it out
[14:48:22] <firespeaker> dalgard: ah
[14:48:37] <Dave_Stein> yar im gonna make a fiddle and then get back to work
[14:49:04] <dalgard> I'm just trying to filter a collection AND it's descendants with a single selector
[14:49:12] <dalgard> (single method)
[14:49:25] <dalgard> plain and simple
[14:49:27] <Dave_Stein> dalgard eh i thought you moved past that with your other question :)
[14:49:32] <Dave_Stein> dalgard gnarf already gave a good answer for that
[14:49:47] <dalgard> ah, same case
[14:50:08] <gnarf> dalgard:  collection.find( selector ).add( collection.filter( selector ) )
[14:50:29] <dalgard> as much as I appreciate gnarfs code, I had already come up with that. It's too much to put in my build function, since that one actually just uses find().
[14:51:11] <gnarf> $.fn.findAndFilter = function( selector ) { return this.filter( selector ).add( this.find( selector ) ); }
[14:51:15] <dalgard> or anyway, I guess I'm just being a pedant...
[14:51:21] <gnarf> done
[14:51:29] <gnarf> now its "one function"
[14:51:30] <dalgard> that was pretty cool :)
[14:51:32] <gnarf> move on
[14:51:40] <gnarf> learn to write plugins
[14:51:40] <gnarf> :)
[14:51:44] <dalgard> thx, gnarf

[14:52:24] <Dave_Stein> firespeaker: http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/AJvM9/
[14:52:44] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: re that Site.init() pattern
[14:52:47] <gnarf> ?newContent
[14:52:47] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[14:52:47] <dalgard> omg the three divs make four squares!
[14:53:07] <Dave_Stein> hahaha
[14:53:17] <Dave_Stein> i was just showing how you can call something now and later with no issue
[14:53:25] <Dave_Stein> whetehr its an existing div or a new div
[14:53:32] <Dave_Stein> gnarf never heard of that one
[14:53:52] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: its something I haven't even really released, just spread around in #jquery from time to time
[14:53:53] <gnarf> :)
[14:54:02] <firespeaker> Dave_Stein: I'm not sure I see what's going on there
[14:54:04] <Dave_Stein> how does that work? i thought node events like that werent in every browser
[14:54:10] <dalgard> what are those strange symbols in the lower left pane? and how'd you make the extra div?
[14:54:16] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: it doesn't use node events
[14:54:19] <dalgard> (sorry...) ;)
[14:54:30] <dalgard> thanks both of you
[14:54:35] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: you have to call newContent() on the new content
[14:54:40] <Dave_Stein> ohhhhhh
[14:54:40] <firespeaker> oh, maybe it's just not directly relevant to what I'm asking(?)
[14:54:42] <gnarf> and it just searches your content for bound selectors
[14:55:03] <Dave_Stein> firespeaker you said you had to put blur on X elements and then you added a new element, but didnt want to double bind
[14:55:15] <Dave_Stein> firespeaker if you replace my .css for .bind you accomplish that
[14:55:23] <Dave_Stein> dalgard i cant tell if youre being sarcastic or not haha
[14:55:37] <dalgard> def sarc
[14:55:38] <Dave_Stein> .bind( 'blur' = .blur - so many people never realize that
[14:55:47] <Dave_Stein> :)
[14:56:40] <Dave_Stein> dalgard ive gotten "whats markup" and "how do i see the console"
[14:56:44] <Dave_Stein> ive only been coming in here for 2 weeks or so
[14:57:13] <dalgard> that's cool :)
[14:57:47] <firespeaker> I've only been using jquery since last night :(
[14:57:57] <firespeaker> but like, I know those things :-P
[14:58:22] <Dave_Stein> yeah i taught a class on native JS recently cause too many people were so far off in the land of JS it annoyed me. prob gonna start teaching it more
[14:58:22] <dalgard> I just log on with the web client when I'm getting frustrated. I make a point of trying to help out at least two other people, though, if there's some immediate questions that are easy for me ;)
[14:58:26] <Dave_Stein> cause people will download jquery and not know anything !
[14:58:37] <firespeaker> Dave_Stein: what's .each() doing there?
[14:59:12] <Dave_Stein> firespeaker when you do $.fn.X it adds a function meant for elements on the page so like when you do $('.elements').css it's kinda like that example
[14:59:30] <dalgard> js is pretty cool by itself, it's just the dom that really sucks...
[14:59:31] <Dave_Stein> so the this in that function refers to a jquery-fied element array and im looping through each one
[14:59:37] <dalgard> (js is VERY cool)
[14:59:41] <dalgard> :)
[14:59:52] <Dave_Stein> and inside that, this refers to the JS node, not the jquery array element
[14:59:58] <Dave_Stein> so i have to put $() around it... and then run .css
[15:00:10] <Dave_Stein> and then .each returns the array it started with just like any other jquery function
[15:00:21] <Dave_Stein> if i didnt return out, i would be breaking a jquery standard
[15:00:30] <firespeaker> hmmmm
[15:01:17] <Dave_Stein> gd had some typos
[15:01:18] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/AJvM9/3/
[15:01:19] <Dave_Stein> see
[15:01:30] <Dave_Stein> if i dont return this in $.fn. function, i wouldnt be able to call .css on the return of that function
[15:02:08] <MadonnaIsSoHot> I want Madonna to tattoo XML on my chest, bite my face with her sharp teeth, scratch me with her nails, and force my head between her legs.
[15:02:23] <MadonnaIsSoHot> Anyone here know about sizzleJS?
[15:02:28] <MadonnaIsSoHot> The CSS selector?
[15:02:42] <Dave_Stein> ok gotta get back to work
[15:02:53] <dalgard> sizzleJS? sure, I have it tattooed on my chest.
[15:03:08] <dalgard> ha...
[15:03:22] <MadonnaIsSoHot> Every time I see Madonna's sexy gap I want her to bite me.
[15:03:41] <dalgard> what's a gap?
[15:03:50] <firespeaker> if I understand right, the basic premise of what's happening is that you're just ~manually adding the trigger to that specific element when it's created
[15:03:58] <firespeaker> which I suppose is what I should be doing
[15:04:18] <firespeaker> dalgard: it's a space between two things
[15:04:24] * MadonnaIsSoHot would pay her millions of dollars to come in, rip me out of my chair, slam my head into the desk, beat, scratch, and bite me, and then have sex with m.
[15:05:15] <ajpiano> MadonnaIsSoHot: i can only let you blather on about this in good conscience for a limited period of time
[15:05:22] <ajpiano> it's pretty weird to keep doing it like every couple of minutes
[15:05:22] <ajpiano> :/
[15:05:27] <MadonnaIsSoHot> NYC dominatrixes are so weak. I pay $900 and get some girl that will only step on my balls.
[15:05:36] <MadonnaIsSoHot> Ah okay
[15:05:39] * MadonnaIsSoHot stops.
[15:05:59] <ajpiano> :)
[15:06:47] <mekwall> dalgard: <br>
[15:07:14] <dalgard> mekwall: ?
[15:07:21] <mekwall> dalgard: that's a gap
[15:07:28] <MadonnaIsSoHot> ajpiano: Do you know if anyone uses sizzleJS sans jquery?
[15:08:07] <stram> hi, i'm trying to use: $('input[type=checkbox]').removeAttr('disabled'); but only on checkboxes which are already disabled (it seems to cause problems for non-disabled checkboxes in IE). how can i do this?
[15:08:07] <dalgard> in that case I too would like to put my hr inside Madonnas br
[15:08:22] <gnarf> wow.... *facepalms*
[15:08:36] <ajpiano> MadonnaIsSoHot: i'm not entirely sure, i think so, but typically it's other libs
[15:08:49] <dalgard> too bad her br is an empty element
[15:08:53] <mekwall> MadonnaIsSoHot: that's like asking if anyone is lying about their usage
[15:09:18] <gnarf> stram: problems?
[15:09:32] <mekwall> you'll never know if the answer they give is falsy or not.
[15:09:33] <gnarf> stram: what version of jQuery?
[15:10:02] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: updating code for 1.6 wasn't so bad so hopefully hes on that :)
[15:10:06] <stram> gnarf: well, the checkbox which is checked (and not disabled) don't get posted in the form, as if they had been disabled
[15:10:21] <stram> jquery 1.6.2
[15:10:24] <mekwall> stram: how about using .prop("disabled", false) ? :)
[15:10:27] <gnarf> .prop( "disabled", false )
[15:10:32] <mekwall> ;)
[15:10:42] <stram> one sec, i heard something about prop in IE working better..
[15:10:47] <gnarf> .removeAttr( "disabled" ) is just plain wrong in 1.6+
[15:11:04] <gnarf> hell, half the calls to .attr() are wrong in 1.6+
[15:11:21] <gnarf> read more about it
[15:11:25] <gnarf> ?prop
[15:11:25] <bot-t> gnarf, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[15:11:55] <stram> hurrah! that does it for IE, thanks gnarf
[15:12:08] <gnarf> stram: if you find yourself using ATTR at all
[15:12:16] <gnarf> ask yourself it you REALLY mean attr
[15:12:45] <MadonnaIsSoHot> Can create an element and attach a jQuery plugin to it before it is attached to the document body? Like, var m = createElement('div'); $(m).calendar();
[15:12:58] <MadonnaIsSoHot> Err, can I
[15:13:09] <mekwall> ?tias @ MadonnaIsSoHot
[15:13:10] <bot-t> MadonnaIsSoHot, Try It And See
[15:13:10] <gnarf> MadonnaIsSoHot: assuming the plugin doesn't care about elements in fragments, yes
[15:13:13] <stram> gnarf: i don't really use javascript that much (more of a C programmer), i'm just writing a quick web interface for my cli C program
[15:13:52] <gnarf> that's okay, this channel is filled with people who don't actually want to learn anything , just want to be told ;)
[15:13:55] <mekwall> stram: I don't drive that much (I'm more of a pedestrian)
[15:14:01] <MadonnaIsSoHot> I guess I'm asking if it is good practice.
[15:14:16] <gnarf> MadonnaIsSoHot: depends on the situation
[15:14:26] <gnarf> MadonnaIsSoHot: its not bad practice if thats what you were asking
[15:14:34] <MadonnaIsSoHot> ok
[15:14:41] <gnarf> it might even be more performant if it does manipulation on the DOM element
[15:15:06] <gnarf> since manip on a fragment not in the DOM won't cause reflows
[15:15:32] <gnarf> downside
[15:15:36] <MadonnaIsSoHot> Exactly! :)
[15:15:38] <MadonnaIsSoHot> Downside?
[15:15:45] <gnarf> you can't get anything position related
[15:16:11] <gnarf> width/height/top/left/etc are gonna not be correct
[15:16:12] <gnarf> so
[15:16:25] <Andrew131> I have  a datepicker for 'form input.date' but when the date input is added via ajax the date picker doesn't work.  How can I correct it?
[15:16:31] <gnarf> if dimensions are irrelevant, there's no harm in working in off-dom nodes
[15:16:49] <gnarf> Andrew131: call .datepicker() on your element from the ajax callback
[15:17:04] <gnarf> it can't just "magically" find it
[15:17:13] <Andrew131> ok
[15:17:17] <gnarf> you have to tell it you added one :)
[15:17:39] <Andrew131> Well thats what I was wondering is if there was a way to tell it but I guess that works too
[15:17:41] <gnarf> instances like that are what i made that newContent() thing for
[15:17:47] <gnarf> ?newContent
[15:17:47] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[15:17:50] <stram> how about "attr('checked',false)", is that incorrect now?
[15:18:07] <gnarf> stram: thats incorrect in ALL versions of jQuery IMO
[15:18:08] <gnarf> :)
[15:18:19] <Andrew131> thanks gnarf
[15:18:25] <stram> prop('checked',false); instead?
[15:18:30] <gnarf> valid in 1.6+
[15:19:28] <gnarf> gotta run, bbl
[15:22:21] <mekwall> Andrew131: sadly the mutaton events have been deprecated and discontinued. only firefox and opera (?) supports (some of) them
[15:23:01] <mekwall> Andrew131: using a plugin is merely a way to work around it
[15:48:17] <haikubear> howdy all
[15:48:56] <haikubear> what's a possible reason that an autocomplete widget would receive the expected response (according to firebug), but not display the autocomplete dropdown?
[15:50:50] <haikubear> if i set it up with local static options instead of a source, it works as expected. but setting a url somehow disables the dropdown.
[15:51:17] <haikubear> i'm working with a php framework (zend) to set this up, and am just not sure where to troubleshoot further.
[15:56:18] * haikubear bangs head on wall.
[15:57:16] <saimon69> hello there
[15:57:53] * haikubear bangs head on floor.
[16:08:25] <johnmclear> I'm having a really stupid problem, I know I can solve it but I spent 30 minutes being an idiot..  $(this).remove("#shine");  <-- under what circumstances would that not work? :|  I have it as a child of this and it's not removing it :|
[16:09:57] <jacof> jQuery('div.product > ul.fav_link.fav_link_inner.clearfix').remove(); <- ok?
[16:11:24] <johnmclear> okay
[16:12:37] <adrianmg> Hi!
[16:12:56] <adrianmg> How can i simply read a RSS feed using jsonp
[16:12:58] <adrianmg> any example?
[16:17:21] <fakingfantastic> how do I get the response object in an ajax success?
[16:30:14] <jacof> What if I wanted to wrap some elements in a div, but I have no classes or ids, just the structure of these elements and their order, and maybe some repeated text inside them
[16:37:32] <Blaster> how would I pass an array of values through Ajax to my php script?
[16:55:17] <willmarshall> Are there any alternatives to JQuery.UIs draggable that play nicely with CSS3?
[16:55:58] <willmarshall> I've got a coverflow-esque app that uses CSS3 animations. I want to make each album in the app draggable, but applying the function ruins the CSS3 for unknown reasons
[17:01:40] <Bower^> I've got a search bar on my site with Ajax functionality which is capable of querying this API twice a second. Sometimes the responses come back in a non-sequential order. Is there some kind of buffer I can use for such instances?
[17:03:18] <twisted`> yo
[17:03:30] <twisted`> I'm having issues in IE8/IE9 with jquery's autocomplete
[17:03:51] <sean`> Bower^, you need to debounce
[17:03:54] <twisted`> using Fiddler I've found out that it DOES indeed talk to my remote datasource and JSON is being returned
[17:03:56] <sean`> do you know what that is?
[17:03:59] <Bower^> I am debouncing :/
[17:04:00] <twisted`> it just doesn't get processed
[17:04:21] <Bower^> Obviously not correctly :D
[17:04:25] <twisted`> if anyone could take a look I'd be more then grateful :D http://www.pizza48.com/
[17:04:29] <sean`> Bower^, are you aborting the previous ajax calls?
[17:04:44] <twisted`> the autocomplete is on the searchbox with the text "Enter your postalcode or town"
[17:04:56] <Bower^> I'm not. How would I go about doing that?
[17:05:01] <twisted`> http://www.pizza48.com/includes/autocomplete.php?c=usa&term=new%20y is the datasource
[17:05:15] <twisted`> I've checked it with jslint and it's correct JSON (being generated with json_encode in PHP)
[17:05:20] <sean`> Bower^, you can fetch the xhr objects, stoer them in an array, and abort the previous ones
[17:05:27] <sean`> that way you will only deal with one result
[17:06:07] <Bower^> sean`,  I'm not even sure what a xhr object is. Any links I should read up?
[17:06:24] <twisted`> the code -does- work when I'm using a JSArray inside the page itself (like the first example on jquery's docs for autocomplete) in IE8/IE9
[17:06:39] <Brodingo> Bower^ http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[17:06:40] <twisted`> Bower^: remote object
[17:07:12] <sean`> Bower^, all ajax calls go through XHR objects (XMLHttpRequest to be precise)
[17:07:26] <sean`> it allowes you to send data with JS, etc.. bla bla bla, but also abort the requests
[17:07:32] <sean`> check out Brodingo's link it'll give you some more info
[17:07:33] <twisted`> sean`: sorry to bother you but could you (maybe) take a look at my issue?
[17:07:38] <twisted`> I suspect it's something really stupid :(
[17:07:53] <Bower^> I use $.getJSON(), does that link still apply?
[17:08:04] <sean`> Bower^, getJSON is nothin but ajax
[17:08:14] <Bower^> Yeah I thought so
[17:08:33] <Bower^> OK thanks guys
[17:08:37] <sean`> twisted`, only in IE8?
[17:09:04] <twisted`> sean`: also IE9 :s
[17:09:13] <twisted`> it just doesn't work at all in IE
[17:09:15] <sean`> yeah, I see
[17:09:25] <twisted`> I've read that IE is more picky with how JS is called then other browsers
[17:09:55] <twisted`> it works fine in Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and thanks to Fiddler (awesome app) I could find out it actually DOES get called from IE
[17:10:02] <twisted`> so it's just processing it wrong/not at all
[17:10:40] <sean`> twisted`, whats' your JS?
[17:10:44] <sean`> pasteibn please
[17:11:19] <twisted`> sean`: you mean the jquery bit?
[17:11:29] <twisted`> sean`: or the response?
[17:11:31] <sean`> JS
[17:11:33] <sean`> not JSON
[17:11:41] <sean`> the $('..')autocomplete
[17:12:04] <Bower^> sean`, if $.getJSON() is just an ajax call why does it even exist within the library if $.ajax()?
[17:12:12] <twisted`> sean`: http://pastebin.com/i3tag5VM
[17:12:19] <sean`> Bower^, wow, mind blowing question, don't get it
[17:12:24] <sean`> try again
[17:13:02] <Blaster> any idea how I could find a select <option value="1">Text</option> by value and change the Text ?
[17:13:11] <Blaster> or simply append to it
[17:13:13] <Bower^> sorry i appreciate it's a bit dumb. i assume you can get json with $.ajax() so?
[17:14:05] <sean`> Bower^, yes .getJSON is a shorthand for $.ajax ('url.json', {dataType: 'json'});
[17:14:47] <Bower^> i thought as much but worth asking. thanks
[17:16:02] <twisted`> sean`: is there a silly mistake in my JS?
[17:16:12] <sean`> nope
[17:16:13] <sean`> seems okay
[17:16:35] * twisted` is sad
[17:16:38] <twisted`> stupid IE
[17:17:09] <twisted`> but yeah target group of this website is well... every user concievable (-ie6 users) so yeah...
[17:17:19] <Ogredude> ok, I've minimized it as much as I can...  http://jsfiddle.net/RFNty/1/ <-- When the js triggers, I completely lose my element with ID "new_pager".  If I comment out the second line, it works just fine.  why?
[17:17:21] <Blaster> so im trying this to append some text to a select option based on it's value, but it isnt working.  Any ideas?  $("#client option[value='"+data.id+"']").text().append($(' - assigned'));
[17:17:33] <sean`> twisted`, are you setting headers for autocomplete.php?
[17:17:38] <twisted`> sean`: any tips where to start looking?
[17:17:42] <twisted`> sean`: yeah application/json
[17:17:47] <sean`> remove that for funsies
[17:17:56] <twisted`> sean`: Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf8
[17:17:59] <twisted`> according to Fiddler
[17:17:59] <twisted`> ok
[17:18:49] <twisted`> what the fuck
[17:18:51] <twisted`> now it suddenly works
[17:18:59] <twisted`> which header should I send then for IE?
[17:19:06] <sean`> just output
[17:19:08] <sean`> tet
[17:19:09] <sean`> text
[17:19:11] <Ogredude> twisted`:  that's the thing I'm starting to notice about Javascript.  Even when you do everything right, you're still doing it wrong.
[17:19:13] <sean`> nothiing else no specific headers
[17:19:28] <twisted`> sean`: now it;s being sent as text/html
[17:19:51] <Ogredude> oh.
[17:19:53] <Ogredude> freakin duh.
[17:20:16] <Ogredude> okay forget I asked. I just realized that #new_tickets .block-content is the container for #new_pager
[17:20:38] <sean`> twisted`, did you remove all header indications?
[17:20:45] <sean`> it should just have a json string output, no other manipulation
[17:21:07] <sean`> because i still get a forced download in IE9
[17:21:27] <twisted`> sean`: testing locally
[17:21:28] <twisted`> :)
[17:21:29] <twisted`> wait a sec
[17:21:30] <twisted`> brb
[17:21:33] <twisted`> nature REALLY calls
[17:21:58] <sean`> k
[17:21:59] <sean`> well
[17:22:06] <sean`> I haven't a clue then
[17:23:57] <sphinxxx> what's a good channel for video?
[17:24:09] <sphinxxx> like encoding/editing stuff
[17:25:42] <sean`> ?lmgtfy media convertor @ sphinxxx
[17:25:42] <bot-t> sphinxxx, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=media+convertor
[17:30:52] <twisted`> sean`: ?
[17:30:59] <twisted`> sean`: no I tested it locally ;)
[17:31:02] <twisted`> not gonna test code LIVE :p
[17:32:03] <twisted`> sean`: you can try now www.pizza48.com
[17:32:18] <twisted`> sean`: thanks so much I never expected a header (a CORRECT header) to @%#&@#* @#$&@#$^* up
[17:32:41] <sean`> koole bro
[17:32:47] <sean`> vote for me for president
[17:33:11] <twisted`> well, knowing JS is not neccesarily a requirement for running a country
[17:33:22] <twisted`> but should be a sign of not being a moron ;)
[17:33:25] <twisted`> sean`++
[17:37:07] <Ogredude> twisted`:  that looks cool as hell, dude
[17:38:10] <twisted`> Ogredude: what does?
[17:38:20] <jowop> http://pastebin.com/PcB86AhL is there a better way to execute the login post in this code? also, is there a way that i can cancel or limit how often the ajax post is being called?
[17:44:42] <Ogredude> twisted`:  that site
[17:44:51] <Ogredude> that's going to be a killer service
[17:45:30] <twisted`> Ogredude: your saying that like it's new
[17:45:31] <twisted`> :p
[17:45:39] <twisted`> Ogredude: where are you from?
[17:46:57] <Ogredude> twisted`:  Idaho, dude.  Everything's new here.
[17:47:12] <Ogredude> this whole area runs about 20 years behind the times
[17:48:50] <Ogredude> twisted`:  witness a completely typical small business webpage from this area. http://www.cheflou.com/
[17:49:15] <twisted`> oh ok
[17:49:17] <twisted`> here in EU
[17:49:21] <twisted`> (can't say about all of EU)
[17:49:25] <twisted`> but NL/DE anyway
[17:49:30] <twisted`> has had services like that for years
[17:49:42] <twisted`> my dad atleast for the last 3 years orders and pays for his pizza online
[17:49:47] <twisted`> using a creditcard or paypal :p
[17:50:07] <Ogredude> well we can order pizza online, but there's no central place to go to see what pizza joints are available in the area
[17:50:14] <twisted`> Ogredude: but, I just work on this site... it's not my concept
[17:50:15] <Ogredude> so it always comes down to Dominos or Pizza Hut
[17:50:32] <twisted`> it's horrible but hey :p
[17:50:34] <twisted`> pays zeh bills
[17:50:45] <Ogredude> hehe
[17:50:57] <twisted`> but yeah I did indeed hear that the USA version was very important
[17:51:25] <twisted`> they're working hard on calling all those tiny businesses to get them listed
[18:00:26] <ProLoser|Work> can anyone recomned some helpful ajax debugging tools?
[18:08:41] <mattp_> does anyone know of a jquery slider that isnt jqueryui?

[18:31:32] <boogerman> hey, our old dev built an ecommerce site using alot of ajax controls. Well, the site isn't navigable(?) . I.E. no back button ability, it's all in one url. I read some about hash taging some things, but I dont know if you can do it with the ajax loaded page of search results. Then I read some other things... what do you guys tihnk I should do?
[18:33:12] <Bower^> I have a list of xhr objects which is constantly updated. When updated, it will .abort() previous entries. This usually works but sometimes old xhr objects still attempt to call its respective callback function which no longer exists and I get an exception thrown. Any ideas on how to solve this?
[18:40:40] <Cydd> hi guys

[18:46:01] <coldhead> good luck buddy!
[18:46:34] <Cydd> omg sorry
[18:46:35] <Cydd> okay
[18:46:42] <Cydd> so i was looking at this thing http://bit.ly/niqIqM
[18:46:54] <Cydd> im not a web pro (like my awesome friends here)
[18:47:01] <Cydd> and i just needed help with something
[18:47:28] <Cydd> 1 - where is the code that expands the size of the tabbed window panel, im adding more tabs (there are 3 currently) and it stays the same size
[18:47:38] <Cydd> 2 - can i make it instead of hover to show, click to show
[18:47:40] <Cydd> that is all
[18:47:43] <Cydd> ily ty
[18:48:25] <Cydd> btw incase anyone is wondering i did a lot of trial/error
[18:50:33] <coldhead> Cydd: for 2 change $items.mouseover to $items.click
[18:52:14] <Cydd> worked with a strange problem
[18:52:30] <Cydd> it displays ALL the tabbed window panels at the same time :\
[18:52:58] <coldhead> change ALL the mouseovers in the code to click
[18:53:09] <coldhead> and i don't know about the height
[18:53:28] <coldhead> i can't see it
[18:53:43] <Cydd> worked!
[18:53:46] * Cydd kisses coldhead
[18:53:50] <Cydd> the height thing
[18:53:53] <Cydd> i will keep looking
[18:54:04] <coldhead> Cydd: are you using firebug or web inspector?
[18:54:14] <Cydd> nah just downloaded the source
[18:54:20] <coldhead> that will let you mess with the css live on the page to experinment
[18:54:23] <coldhead> much quicker
[18:54:25] <Cydd> hmmm
[18:58:42] <asidjazz> how come when i pull some html from a .get and put it in a div and reference an element inside of that afterwardds via id=""
[18:58:45] <asidjazz> the object is emtpy?
[19:00:10] <coldhead> are you sure you're acessing it afterwards?
[19:00:33] <coldhead> if you do $.get(whatever); and then on the next line $('somethinggromwhatever')
[19:00:43] <coldhead> it won't work because the get() won't have finished yet
[19:01:01] <coldhead> it's still loading in the background
[19:01:14] <gataraid> 	jQuery.validator.addMethod("answerYes", function(value, element) {
[19:01:15] <gataraid> 		return value != element.val() == 'yes';
[19:01:15] <gataraid> 	}, "You must answer Yes");
[19:01:17] <gataraid> should this work?
[19:02:32] <coldhead> ?eval 'aids' != 'lol' == 'lol';
[19:02:33] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[19:03:14] <MetaJake> using jqueryUi's dialog function, the popup window is appearing halfway down the height of my page, no matter what I set the position option of the dialog function call to, or the css of the dialog selector content... any ideas on how to get my dialog to open near the top of a very tall page?...
[19:03:15] <amid_hasan> hi. trying to replace img src and dimension within a#someid img with a#someid (new)img. ideas?
[19:03:16] <coldhead> the precedence isn't clear, gataraid
[19:03:22] <coldhead> use some parens
[19:03:40] <coldhead> ?p @ amid_hasan
[19:03:40] <bot-t> amid_hasan, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[19:04:08] <amid_hasan> i know how to select the img but replace ??
[19:04:36] <MetaJake> amid_hasan .attr('src','newsorce')
[19:04:45] <amid_hasan> MetaJake: thank you!
[19:05:06] <MetaJake> jQuery(.selector).attr('src','newsourcevalue') ... or SOmething liek that.
[19:05:36] <coldhead> thanks MetaJake
[19:05:41] <amid_hasan> Trying this now
[19:05:51] <coldhead> k
[19:06:09] <MetaJake> is there a channel for jqueryUI specific discussion?
[19:06:42] <coldhead> this is it, MetaJake
[19:06:46] <coldhead> it's a damn shame
[19:07:44] <MetaJake> cool. .. anyone have experience with the .dialog function, opening the dialog box halfway down the page height by default.. and how to overwrite that when the .dialog function's "position" option is not doin' it for me?
[19:08:54] <coldhead> i rely on ajpiano to fix things like that
[19:08:59] <coldhead> he LOVES jQuery UI
[19:09:24] <MetaJake> heh i see. ajpiano wheeere are youuu
[19:09:35] <MetaJake> hmm.. back to messin' with this thing.

[19:11:52] <MetaJake> darn
[19:11:55] <amid_hasan> the element im trying to target is in an iframe... maybe thats the reason
[19:12:43] <MetaJake> I am not sure about iframes and if jquery works in the same way that it does with other html elements.. not sure..
[19:13:05] <MetaJake> maybe this doc page explains it http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[19:14:01] <amid_hasan> perusing
[19:16:38] <amid_hasan> no luck. cant hack the iframe
[19:16:55] <MetaJake> i see
[19:17:08] <amid_hasan> DOPE
[19:17:10] <amid_hasan> major DOPE
[19:17:35] <amid_hasan> I was targeting the link as #div a versus a#div the link was not nested!

[19:19:59] <Bower^> http://dan-bower.net/mashup-error/discography.php?artistID=b5da4546-42f4-4bfb-a898-4f01682a488c - Can someone please help me figure out how to stop the "jQuery4234234234243 is not a function" exception sometimes being thrown when typing stuff into the search bar? It does seem to actually work but obviously I'm not understanding something fundamental
[19:20:58] <amid_hasan> MetaJake: thanks for your help!
[19:21:07] <Bower^> http://dan-bower.net/mashup-error/js/search.js - The actual code doing it
[19:22:02] <MetaJake> amid_hasan, thanks for your challenge
[19:29:42] <ProLoser|Work> any ideas why a endpoint that i am supposed to submit json data to returns 200 if the data is blank but 400 for this string? http://pastebin.com/ZHSgD6Bf
[19:31:32] * Bower^ looks in ajpiano's direction with puppy dog eyes
[20:09:16] <cypha> I have two questions pertaining to file upload, 1) what kind of column type do I need in my database for the uploaded file? is it just a string that is the path to the file on the filesystem? 2) how can I allow large file sizes to be uploaded (>2gb)
[20:09:41] <KicStart42> cypha: question #2 depends on the database type
[20:09:47] <cypha> postgres
[20:12:51] <daleharvey> cypha: doesnt really have anything to do with jquery, but in general you want to avoid putting uploaded binaries inside databases
[20:13:14] <daleharvey> you just store the filepath in the database
[20:13:23] <cypha> k
[20:13:25] <cypha> cool
[20:13:38] <cypha> and is there a limit to the uploaded file's size?
[20:13:41] <daleharvey> and there is no limit to the filesize, although depending on your server configuration you may need to change things to get larger files
[20:13:50] <cypha> oh, i see
[20:14:00] <cypha> any idea if apache needs tweaking?
[20:15:05] <daleharvey> http://php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.php is a decent place to find the various issues
[20:17:12] <cypha> daleharvey, i'm not using php, does the link still apply?
[20:18:18] <daleharvey> it mentions iis and apache configurations
[20:20:07] <cypha> aah, ok, i see it
[20:20:35] <cypha> is there a jquery module that allows for file uploading of multiple files, drag/drop, and a progress bar?
[20:21:42] <ajpiano> cypha: have you seen http://www.plupload.com/
[20:22:11] <cypha> no sir, but i will now
[20:22:13] <daleharvey> I wrote some code to do that, its fairly simple, but will only work in newer browsers
[20:22:14] <daleharvey> http://dropup.net/
[20:23:05] <cypha> what's "newer"?
[20:23:13] <yottzumm> I'm having trouble getting keystrokes to work inside a sortable/portlet
[20:23:33] <daleharvey> chrome, firefox, probably opera, possibly some new ie
[20:23:33] <yottzumm> I'm pretty much a newbie
[20:23:39] <cypha> daleharvey, thanks drag/drop only?
[20:24:26] <daleharvey> Yeh I didnt add a fallback
[20:24:49] <yottzumm> works in safari, not in firefox
[20:25:15] <daleharvey> should work back to firefox 3.6
[20:25:45] <daleharvey> but yeh its not maintained, I just played around for an afternoon and forgot about it
[20:25:52] <yottzumm> I have sample code if someone wants to look at it in firefox
[20:26:06] <cypha> haha
[20:26:08] <cypha> nice
[20:27:03] <cypha> ajpiano, is it me or this doesn't have drag/drop http://www.plupload.com/example_queuewidget.php
[20:27:06] <cypha> even though it says it does
[20:27:36] <yottzumm> http://www.coderextreme.net/problem.html
[20:28:11] <ajpiano> where does it say it does
[20:28:45] <cypha> on the main page
[20:28:59] <cypha> Drag/Drop is checked for html5
[20:29:13] <cypha> and i'm in firefox
[20:31:35] <cakehero> Anyone know why this code isn't creating a "hole" in the inner polygon? http://bin.cakephp.org/view/388924051 <- code http://cl.ly/1V2e2v0E1E2M0y0M470P <-- image
[20:32:27] <EtHeO> hey all, i've got a problem with jquery mobile. see on this page: jutatech.dev.studioseptember.nl/assessment/lijst/belastingdienst
[20:32:36] <ajpiano> cypha: it uses the runtimes in the order specified in the code
[20:32:42] <ajpiano> so i think it's supporting other stuff before html5
[20:32:44] <ajpiano> just a guess
[20:32:45] <EtHeO> once more with http: http://jutatech.dev.studioseptember.nl/assessment/lijst/belastingdienst
[20:32:45] <gataraid> how can I check the value of the radio buttons (yes/no) using jquery validate plugin
[20:33:21] <cypha> ajpiano, any other option for drag/drop + multiple files + progress bar?
[20:33:26] <ajpiano> i don't know
[20:33:26] <gataraid> I'm trying to make the value yes have to be answered in order to submit the form
[20:33:29] <EtHeO> basically, jquery mobile is using ajax (even when I instruct it NOT to)
[20:33:53] <EtHeO> and the ajax messes up the radio buttons, causing them not to be selected, when the form is submitted
[20:33:54] <cypha> maybe something that looks small like gmail's file attachment
[20:34:49] <ajpiano> EtHeO: where are you telling it not to
[20:35:00] <EtHeO> on my local version ;)
[20:35:05] <ajpiano> lol
[20:35:26] <EtHeO> which is pushed to that url now
[20:35:28] <IanWizard-Cloud> Is there something like .get() that returns a jQuery object?
[20:35:38] <cakehero> I'm a sad cake hero =(
[20:36:20] <ajpiano> IanWizard-Cloud: huh?
[20:36:55] <cakehero> IanWizard-Cloud you mean instead of a function callback?
[20:36:56] <ajpiano> IanWizard-Cloud, oh, you mean see ?eq
[20:36:56] <bot-t> IanWizard-Cloud, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[20:37:17] <cakehero> IanWizard-Cloud $( $.get() )
[20:37:18] <cakehero> heh
[20:37:22] <IanWizard-Cloud> ajpiano: $.get(0) returns the first element in the jQuery list, but as a node, rather than as a jquery element
[20:37:26] <IanWizard-Cloud> cakehero: yes,
[20:37:27] <ajpiano> IanWizard-Cloud: use .eq
[20:37:32] <IanWizard-Cloud> cakehero: but built in.
[20:37:36] <IanWizard-Cloud> ajpiano: ok.
[20:37:39] <ajpiano> $("foo').eq(4);
[20:37:40] <ajpiano> etc
[20:38:02] <IanWizard-Cloud> ajpiano: Ok, that's what I was looking for.. Thank You :)
[20:38:13] <IanWizard-Cloud> (cakehero, cheer up :) )
[20:38:16] <cakehero> heh
[20:38:19] <cakehero> IanWizard-Cloud thx
[20:38:19] <EtHeO> ajpiano: $(document).bind("mobileinit", function(){	$.mobile.ajaxFormsEnabled = false;	$.mobile.ajaxLinksEnabled = false;});
[20:38:25] <ajpiano> i see
[20:38:28] <cakehero> google maps needs to cheer up
[20:39:05] <ajpiano> EtHeO: i would feel so much better about this if like
[20:39:20] <ajpiano> there wasn't a backend exception leaking out into the HTML before the doctype
[20:39:29] <EtHeO> oooh, there is? :D
[20:39:41] <ajpiano> view-source:http://jutatech.dev.studioseptember.nl/assessment/lijst/belastingdienst
[20:40:15] <EtHeO> jup
[20:40:17] <EtHeO> i see it now
[20:40:26] <EtHeO> doesnt do that in local ;)
[20:42:48] <EtHeO> fixed that
[20:43:05] <EtHeO> nasty deprecation warning, together with custom error reporting :D
[20:43:13] <ajpiano> EtHeO: it changed in the latest beta i think
[20:43:37] <ajpiano> if you go here, there is no reference to ajaxLinksEnabled and ajaxFormsEnabled anymore
[20:43:38] <ajpiano> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[20:43:42] <ajpiano> just ajaxEnabled
[20:43:44] <EtHeO> ack, what is it now?
[20:43:44] <ajpiano> give that a shot
[20:43:49] <EtHeO> ajaxEnabled then?
[20:43:58] <ajpiano> try it
[20:44:53] <EtHeO> yay!
[20:44:55] <EtHeO> works
[20:44:57] <ajpiano> kborchers: are you there
[20:45:01] <kborchers> yep
[20:45:02] <ajpiano> EtHeO: hooray
[20:45:16] <EtHeO> would love to have it working with ajax though, but will accept this workaround :)
[20:45:22] <ajpiano> do you have a couple mins to look at something weird with menu
[20:45:23] <EtHeO> ajpiano: lifesaver :D
[20:45:34] <kborchers> sure
[20:45:38] <ajpiano> cool
[20:45:39] <ajpiano> i'll pm
[20:45:43] <kborchers> kk

[21:43:17] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[21:43:33] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use templates?
[21:47:57] <ProLoser|Work> i want to pass options to {{tmpl}}
[21:48:05] <ProLoser|Work> that were passed to the parent template
[22:05:01] <ProLoser|Work> how do i use functions in templates?
[22:24:25] <ddoom> I have a div with a text field in it. If I enter text in the field, is there a way I can get the full HTML for the input field including the new input value?
[22:29:16] <ddoom> http://jsfiddle.net/v5QFF/1/ enter text then push submit - I want it to include the input value in the html
[22:33:36] <ProLoser|Work> $(input).val()
[22:35:23] <ddoom> ProLoser|Work: I don't want just the val, I want the html for the input field including the value
[22:35:39] <ProLoser|Work> $(input)
[22:35:41] <ProLoser|Work> iunno
[22:35:47] <ProLoser|Work> i don't get the confusion
[22:37:37] <ddoom> I'm not confused. Try it. Enter something in the input box, push submit it will return the HTML excluding the value you just entered.
[22:38:40] <ProLoser|Work> hmm
[22:38:51] <ProLoser|Work> why do you want the html anyway?
[22:39:45] <ProLoser|Work> i need a template guru :(
[22:39:50] <ProLoser|Work> shit is fucking hard to debug
[23:39:43] <ProLoser|Work> i fucking hate templates
[23:43:59] <blindMoe> .
