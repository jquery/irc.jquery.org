[00:44:04] <raj> senor shoky?
[00:51:24] <p3lim> Anyone here used github's api with ajax before?
[01:09:49] <jiangquan> #jquery mobile
[01:13:18] <czjq> hello,guys
[01:13:36] <czjq> who is chinese?
[01:41:15] <pathologizee> date
[01:42:10] <shoky> oi raj
[01:47:27] <motaka2> how to figure out the element next to the current element is a div with class "foo" ?
[01:53:06] <shoky> `api is
[01:53:07] <b-ot> shoky: .is(): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return <code>true</code> if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[02:03:23] <d0den> does changing the "preload" attribute of an html5 audio element have any effect after the page has loaded?
[02:04:02] <d0den> e.g. have an element with preload="none", but change it to preload="auto" when the user interacts with the element
[03:15:13] <tolborg> when writing plugins, is it possible to declare 'private' chainable methods only available within the plugin?
[03:19:33] <doug65536> tolborg: I don't think that is entirely possible
[03:20:24] <doug65536> tolborg: it depends on exactly what you expect to be able to do
[03:21:00] <doug65536> you could implement a function that chains its own jquery wrapper wrapper to make that happen I suppose
[03:21:00] <tolborg> doug65536: Well, I just find myself writing a lot of functions in my plugin code. Some of the functions would be nice to have as chainable methods
[03:22:12] <tolborg> doug65536: I was just curious. Its not crucial. But thanks :)
[03:22:27] <doug65536> tolborg: I'll see if I can make a fiddle that does something like that.,..
[03:22:39] <tolborg> doug65536: that would rock.. I would love to see it
[03:30:28] <doug65536> tolborg: http://jsfiddle.net/YYQc8/
[03:32:16] <doug65536> tolborg: tests more http://jsfiddle.net/YYQc8/1/
[03:33:15] <tolborg> doug65536: this pattern is pretty much what im looking for. Great! :)
[04:13:18] <Tingle> I know this isnt the php channel, seems you need a invite to get in there - but I have one quest maybe someone can help me with here. My mysql db is unicode and supports characters like 'ß', and so does my website and text fields. but when I get a string out of my DB that contains that letter, and set the value of a input text field to it, it shows that character as '?' - any idea why?
[04:22:41] <Corrado> i reload page with ajax, i have to reload all javascript ( like document.ready? ) this reload is slow
[04:27:23] <HD|Laptop> Hey
[04:28:03] <HD|Laptop> Tingle: did you do a set_charset on your MySQLi interface?
[04:28:19] <HD|Laptop> Tingle: if you're using mysql_* then use mysqli_* and set_charset then it works
[04:28:39] <Tingle> mm i did a utf8_encode on the string, that seems to work
[04:28:48] <HD|Laptop> Tingle: also check if you do output correct charset-headers
[04:29:06] <Tingle> yeah, my header is correct
[04:37:44] <gvo> I am trying to get a click event to fire on a div addressed by class.  See http://jsfiddle.net/NPseC/2/ can someone spot what I'm doing wrong?
[04:39:05] <gvo> Never mind.
[05:13:55] <Tingle> did jquery just update and break?
[05:14:15] <Tingle> im getting SyntaxError: missing ; before statement  in jquery.min.js:24
[05:16:58] <Tingle> nvm
[05:27:50] <anew> have an input wheere users cant enter spaces
[05:27:55] <anew> but they're entering it all the time
[05:28:00] <anew> anything else i can do besides jq
[05:38:59] <doug65536> anew: code?
[05:39:23] <doug65536> anew: most likely explanation is an event handler
[05:39:44] <anew> i mean it's working
[05:39:49] <anew> i cant enter spaces
[05:39:56] <anew> but how the hell is everyone else entering them lol
[05:40:03] <anew> cant be so many users who have js disabled
[05:40:49] <doug65536> anew: does the input tag have pattern= in the html?
[05:40:53] <doug65536> attribute
[05:40:59] <anew> nope
[05:41:05] <anew> any other thing i can do other than js
[05:41:24] <doug65536> how many plugins are messing with everything
[05:41:34] <anew> a lot
[05:41:37] <anew> i hvae a ton of plugins
[05:41:41] <doug65536> well there's your answer
[05:41:52] <anew> how?
[05:43:05] <doug65536> how what? how would a plugin do that? easy, an event that calls event.preventDefault() when event.which is a space and event.type is "keypress"
[05:43:20] <anew> it works tho
[05:43:23] <anew> everything is working for me
[05:43:30] <anew> just dunno why for everyon eelse its not
[05:43:45] <doug65536> link?
[05:43:51] <doug65536> I'll see if I can reproduce it
[05:43:58] <anew> meh will keep testing it
[05:44:00] <anew> thanks tho doug
[05:46:17] <doug65536> what would happen if a UTF-8 character in an ajax response was outside the basic multilingual plane (higher than 65535). does jquery translate it to a UTF-16 surrogate pair?
[05:47:07] <doug65536> or would that be handled by the browser's native xhr, and does it do that for you
[05:54:16] <gvo> What do you have to do to make .add work?  http://jsfiddle.net/MeRER/
[05:57:16] <shoky> gvo: you probably want .append
[05:57:31] <codepodu> gvo: you want .append
[05:57:52] <codepodu> gvo: .add adds to search results, not to the DOM
[05:58:50] <gvo> shoky codepodu OK thanks.  So if I want it inside of the existing div?  Seems like append would place it after.
[05:59:11] <codepodu> no, append places inside. .after places after
[05:59:11] <shoky> why does it seem like it
[05:59:42] <gvo> I guess I think of the verb append as placing after.  More English definition.
[05:59:50] <gvo> OK I'll try it.  THanks.
[06:00:30] <gvo> That worked.  Thanks.
[06:00:40] <gregtom6> hy all
[06:01:29] <gregtom6> how should I add more things in there? http://pastebin.com/pPKp1guE
[06:01:45] <gregtom6> things like daynameshort in that code
[06:04:27] <shoky> put a comma between them?
[06:06:54] <Corrado> if i reload my page with ajax, how can i use the function that are declared in document.ready?
[06:08:05] <Reck> I am trying to get a JSON array into a variable
[06:08:12] <Reck>     $.getJSON("{{ URL::action('CollectionController@getAjaxMyItems') }}", function(data) {
[06:08:12] <Reck>         $.each(data, function(index) {
[06:08:12] <Reck>             alert(data[index].name);
[06:08:13] <Reck>         });
[06:08:15] <Reck>     });
[06:08:20] <Reck> This is working, but it uses the array right away
[06:08:35] <Reck> var test = $.getJSON("{{ URL::action('CollectionController@getAjaxMyItems') }}") is not working. How can I achieve this?
[06:08:47] <gregtom6> shoky: between what? nope, I'm speaking of what should I do if I would like to write another thing to insert there, like the shortdaynames
[06:09:06] <gregtom6> a vector, or what is that
[06:09:19] <gregtom6> how should I insert another vector in there? what is the syntax?
[06:10:51] <gvo> Reck: next time, use pastebin
[06:12:31] <gvo> Reck were you expecting to get something in test?
[06:12:58] <Reck> gvo: yes
[06:13:13] <gvo> The getJSON is asyncronous
[06:13:32] <Reck> What is that exactly? :-P
[06:13:42] <gvo> reck that means, it doesn't wait for a response.
[06:14:16] <gvo> In your first example the function is called when the data gets back.
[06:14:46] <gvo> You'll have to process the data in that function.
[06:16:00] <gvo> So whatever you had planned on doing with that data will have to be deferred until the "success" function is executed.
[06:18:26] <gregtom6> somebody?
[06:22:44] <JohnTerryXYZ> Hey
[06:22:48] <JohnTerryXYZ> What's up?
[06:22:54] <JohnTerryXYZ> Wanted to share a new programming forum/community: http://thedevshed.net/forum/
[06:22:59] <JohnTerryXYZ> Feel free to join :)
[06:23:25] <JohnTerryXYZ> Here is a link to JavaScript/jQuery section: http://thedevshed.net/forum/html-xhtml-css-javascript/
[06:28:00] <Reck> gvo: Alright, I got it working. Thank you :-)
[06:28:49] <Reck> I have a portion of HTML code I wish to append to an element a number of times in a loop. How can I do that in a smart way? (Defining the "template" somewhere?) - Here is the HTML: http://pastebin.com/BWUjrB3Z
[06:32:31] <gregtom6> somebody?
[06:34:27] <gregtom6> http://pastebin.com/VVhrqpZY
[06:46:01] <shoky> gregtom6: that's how you would do it.. you can only put valid datepicker options there though..
[06:56:21] <SurvivorZ> How can I 1) show background text inside a <input text> and 2) replace that text character-by-character as the user types?
[06:56:27] <b-ot> SurvivorZ: No output.
[06:56:48] <SurvivorZ> What do you mean, no output?
[06:57:13] <SurvivorZ> I will pay whomever helps me $5-10 for the answer, as I have struggled w/ this.
[07:04:02] <TheGallery> You can display text in the bg with the placeholder attribute, I am trying to figure what you mean with number two though
[07:04:27] <SurvivorZ> Yeah check out http://www.phpu.cc/repo/megadiction/
[07:04:39] <SurvivorZ> click "show answer"
[07:04:51] <SurvivorZ> it shows the word "bad" but when you start typing, the word "bad" disappears
[07:05:07] <SurvivorZ> i'd like to be able to type the "b", have that show up as a black b, and still have "ad" as light grey
[07:05:31] <TheGallery> oh like google's searching
[07:06:44] <pathologizee> am looking for a jquery plug in that resize text whenever you resize your browser, have used it before, but i can't remember the name, someone help me out please
[07:07:13] <SurvivorZ> TheBallery that's a great idea.... i could pop it underneath somehow like google does when i'm typing...
[07:08:55] <adebabs> #wdf
[07:09:23] <TheGallery> SurvivorZ, http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/ the first example implements what you need. I can' t help you directly but you can look up their code and see the implementation
[07:32:46] <OnkelTem> Hi. I'm playing with 'accordion'-style menu and I'm confused with the way jQuery animation works: when I show "UL" element, it gets 'overflow: hidden' attribute which makes while animation jumpy. Is this how jQuery works?
[07:32:59] <OnkelTem> s/while/whole/
[07:41:53] <JohnTerryXYZ> Hey
[07:42:33] <JohnTerryXYZ> is .size() method still used in some cases? Or is it completely substituted by .length?
[08:02:45] <shoky> JohnTerryXYZ: they're identical, no reason to use .size()
[08:03:35] <shoky> also it's deprecated

[08:26:36] <relix> hey guys, I'm trying to get my head around deffered/promises
[08:26:59] <relix> is there a way to make a deffered object be resolved/rejected on the basis of another deffered object
[08:28:25] <relix> https://gist.github.com/dv/3a7c716c93aef3b2e07b
[08:28:33] <relix> ^ as you can see, I'm calling .resolve() in a .done
[08:28:37] <relix> and .reject in a .fail
[08:28:48] <relix> it seems like that's not very logical/idiomatic
[08:29:44] <shoky> relix: why not just return the $.ajax promise?
[08:30:00] <relix> shoky I have some code that needs the deferred before the $.ajax request
[08:30:30] <relix> basically the ajax request is only executed sometimes
[08:30:59] <shoky> oks, then i don't really see a problem there
[08:31:15] <relix> this is as good as it gets then?
[08:35:45] <shoky> guess so
[08:37:12] <p3lim> Anyone here used github's api with ajax before?
[08:53:36] <CrysAk> Question : I;m using "introjs" which is great, however i can still access the site while it;s active which .. obviously causes some major undesired effects, is there a way to disable EVERYTHING when using this?
[08:56:30] <themic8> I have a Question, If I have a webform and I want to update a text field on that form from a element on the page.  Is there a good function for that, change(), val()?
[08:56:53] <Asmooh> serious, why doesnt jqm works fine on every platform
[08:56:58] <Asmooh> why change things
[08:56:59] <Asmooh> -_-
[09:00:01] <relix> thanks shoky
[09:18:23] <CrysAk> can anyone help : want to make the highlighted areas in intro.js disabled (so users can;t clikc on buttons in the highlighted area, much like they can;t click on items int he background)  TEST CASE : http://carclubbed.com/index.php email = test@driveaddiction.com password = pass then click on the "?" ont he right
[09:36:02] <gdoteof> i am doing a $.ajax(...) call.  it was working fine on my local network (i am 192.168.1.x, the server was at 192.168.1.y) but now that i have it "on the internet" i am getting a completely unhelpful "network error"
[09:36:08] <gdoteof> code: 19
[09:36:40] <sammych> okay
[09:36:45] <sammych> tell me I'm not going crazy
[09:36:51] <sammych> but where did my console go?
[09:37:20] <chilversc> gdoteof: I'd fire up your browser's developer tools, and keep an eye on the network connections
[09:37:49] <chilversc> gdoteof: that'll normally contain the exact response from the server and the response body (which can sometimes contain an error message)
[09:37:52] <sammych> as in, why are all the console functions all blank functions?
[09:38:15] <chilversc> blank functions?
[09:38:26] <sammych> function() {|
[09:38:30] <sammych> function() {}
[09:38:43] <chilversc> formatting error? since the console functions are often native
[09:38:43] <gdoteof> chilversc: i am using chrome with the console open; do you mean something beyond that?
[09:38:50] <gdoteof> is there some magic developer tool page i have been missing for years?
[09:38:58] <chilversc> gdoteof: no, that'll do, go to the network tab
[09:39:11] <chilversc> gdoteof: if by console you mean the web developer tools (F12)
[09:39:38] <sammych> chilversc_: I mean, in WebKit, they've seemed to have killed off the console.* functions
[09:39:41] <chilversc> sammych: that or, do you have a variable in scope called console?
[09:40:41] <sammych> this is everywhere
[09:40:42] <chilversc> sammych: are you testing this with the developer tools open?
[09:40:45] <sammych> on a new tab
[09:40:49] <sammych> about:blank
[09:41:07] <chilversc> so you're testing this in the console?
[09:41:09] <sammych> console.log, warn, dir, group, etc
[09:41:13] <sammych> are all just function() {}
[09:41:16] <chilversc> and console.log("foo") does nothing?
[09:41:41] <sammych> returns undefined
[09:41:58] <chilversc> disable all your plugins, restart the browser and try again?
[09:42:02] <sammych> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7089443/restoring-console-log
[09:42:35] <sammych> I've no idea where this is coming from, but this is new to me
[09:42:43] <sammych> I've been using console up to last night
[09:43:20] <chilversc> yeah, wondering if a plugin has gone awry and changed the console functions
[09:43:49] <chilversc> s/plugin/extension/
[09:44:02] <sammych> well, it'd have to be adblock, that's the only one I left un-disabled
[09:44:38] <sammych> nope
[09:44:39] <chilversc> sammych: also, did you try the; delete console.log and did that work?
[09:44:48] <sammych> yeah, it does what it says on the box
[09:44:52] <sammych> it deletes console.log
[09:45:07] <sammych> and it's not defined anymore ;)
[09:45:57] <chilversc> what does console.__proto__ say?
[09:46:54] <sammych> swear that didn't work before
[09:47:05] <sammych> but why, is my next question
[09:49:53] <sammych> thanks, for making try that again ;)
[09:50:21] <chilversc> sammych: so that works and gives you the correct result? ie an object of type Console with the correct methods?
[09:51:28] <sammych> yeah, I just put console.log = console.__proto__.log;
[09:51:45] <sammych> but I could restore it all
[09:52:11] <chilversc> sammych: but that doesn't explain why delete console.log didn't work
[09:52:29] <chilversc> having removed that property from console it should have reverted to looking in __proto__
[09:52:37] <sammych> ah, good point
[09:54:03] <chilversc> also doesn't explain where those functions are comming from, but does indicate you're not dealing with another variable hiding console
[09:56:56] <sammych> okay
[09:57:01] <sammych> now I don't even have the proto
[09:58:05] <sammych> this is some weird stuff happening right now
[09:58:27] <chilversc> yup, are you running Chrome Canary?
[09:58:33] <sammych> just stable
[09:58:44] <sammych> but it's the same with safari as well
[09:58:58] <chilversc> wonder if it could be a native plugin instead
[09:59:21] <sammych> well, it's happening on my work machine too
[09:59:28] <chilversc> you could try chrome://plugins and disable a few of them?
[10:00:18] <xnotte> anyone works with fullcalendar ? i have this doubt http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18658049/fullcalendar-refresh-events-removing-selected
[10:01:05] <chilversc> xnotte: sorry, I can't understand the problem from that question
[10:01:32] <chilversc> xnotte: I'd write a really simple application that emulates the problem (ie, simulate the server response)
[10:02:04] <chilversc> xnotte: so that someone can paste the code in to a .html file, and run it from their local machine without any webserver, and click a single button to see the problem
[10:02:23] <chilversc> that way its easy to debug what is happening, and you might then get a response to the SO post
[10:04:55] <sammych> anyway, I gotta go
[10:05:04] <sammych> just, strange
[10:06:40] <xnotte> chilversc ok i'll do tha
[10:07:38] <chilversc> xnotte: remember, goal is to keep it as simple as possible while demonstraiting the problem, so really all you want is a full calender, click a button, and problem produced
[10:09:20] <chilversc> xnotte: though I tend to find the answer to the problem whilst going through the "distilling" to the simplest possible thing step, because it removes all the code except that which causes the problem
[10:19:01] <xnotte> chilversc: i didnt understood your last sentence
[10:19:32] <plong0> hello, I am having a problem with a change() event for radio buttons - it is firing only the first time the value is changed
[10:20:54] <chilversc> xnotte: I was just that in simplfying the problem to the simplest possible thing that shows the error to create an example, I often end up finding the cause of that error
[10:21:27] <chilversc> xnotte: since when I create the first example it often doesn't have the error, and I have to keep adding things and comparing against what the full code is doing to try and cause the error
[10:21:40] <chilversc> xnotte: and at that point I know what the last thing I changed was, and thus what is causing the error
[10:22:13] <xnotte> chilversc: oh i understood now
[10:22:26] <xnotte> but i don't think it's an error
[10:22:38] <xnotte> i just don't know how i do that
[10:27:05] <plong0> anyone knows why radio change events only fire first time it is changed?
[10:27:48] <plong0> even tried putting the click() event on them instead... and still it only fires the first time I click on one
[10:41:09] <plong0> woops.  firebug console was stacking my messages.  tricked me into thinking the even fired only the first time
[10:41:19] <grafi> yeah
[10:41:24] <grafi> i have that all the time
[10:41:25] <grafi> <.<

[11:59:40] <gnarf> dev11 yes, it uses XHR, unless its JSONP in which case it uses a <script> tag
[12:00:03] <dev11> CWSpear, CWSpear yes
[12:00:23] <dev11> gnarf, thanks
[12:01:51] <hazardous> how can i non-asynchronously fire off 1000 http requests in order with $.getJSON with a 1.5 second delay in bteween each?
[12:01:59] <hazardous> setting async false seems to just cause weird behaviour
[12:03:53] <CWSpear> hazardous, why are you trying to do this? synchronous (aka non-asynchronous) requests block IO and freeze the browser
[12:10:10] <CWSpear> hazardous, it make be that synchronous requests just are odd. I know some frameworks specifically don't allow for synchronous requests
[12:14:20] <gnarf> hazardous use a queue?
[13:10:44] <fl0w> I'm creating a form, nested inside a table, dynamically with both inputs and selects (yes, this is tabular data). I basically add an integer to the id for each new row on added input/select elements. How can I select everything within the form without getting all the table data/elements?
[13:52:14] <Imaginativeone> I am having a little trouble with parseXml...
[13:52:27] <Imaginativeone> The input is an xml dom tree.
[13:52:38] <Imaginativeone> What is the output?

[14:37:32] <raj> hey shoky
[14:47:41] <raj> no matter what width/height I put on an img, it shrink scales to the size of its div container. However, the overflow calculation still yields overflow as true. How can I calculate the width/height of the img so that overflow will be false? (the containing div is sized using `em`s, not pixels)

[15:10:45] <doug65536> shoky already shot him
[15:14:23] <Manusoftar> guys, i'm trying to handle the onkeydown event for all the input elements on a form, i'm using the following code -> $("input").on(keyDown,keyPressed); //Note that keyPressed is a function i wrote to handle the event
[15:14:28] <Manusoftar> is it correct?
[15:14:40] <doug65536> np
[15:14:41] <doug65536> no
[15:14:54] <doug65536> $("input").on('keydown',keyPressed)
[15:15:21] <doug65536> Manusoftar: what does your handler do? usually you want keyup
[15:15:52] <doug65536> Manusoftar: if you think you wanted keydown, you probably wanted keypress
[15:16:02] <Manusoftar> sorry my code was -> $("input").on("keydown",keyPressed);
[15:16:20] <raj> kk, goodight mr. shoky
[15:16:20] <doug65536> Manusoftar: bad naming. there is a keypress event you know
[15:17:06] <Manusoftar> is a function i wrote to check for an user name to see if it is already used, then it would make a div visible where it warns you that you have to choose another username to register (i do the checking through AJAX)
[15:17:26] <doug65536> Manusoftar: keyup is better for that
[15:17:44] <Manusoftar> ok, i'll use it instead, thanks doug65536!
[15:17:45] <doug65536> Manusoftar: the character hasn't even been added yet in keydown
[15:17:58] <doug65536> Manusoftar: and you'll get spammed with events if they hold it
[15:19:02] <Manusoftar> so it'll be $("input").on("keyup",keyPressed);?, mostly what i wasn't sure was if i could call the function instead of implementing it on the fly
[15:19:21] <doug65536> Manusoftar: putting the name there like that works
[15:19:26] <Manusoftar> like $("input").on("keyup",function keyPressed(){ .... });
[15:19:30] <doug65536> Manusoftar: functions are values in js
[15:19:35] <Manusoftar> ok
[15:19:44] <Manusoftar> thats what i thought ;D
[15:19:49] <grafi> doug65536 whats they reasoning for keyup over keydown?
[15:20:00] <doug65536> grafi: not getting spammed with events mainly
[15:20:14] <doug65536> grafi: and in keydown, the key hasn't even been added to val yet
[15:20:30] <grafi> thats probably more important :D
[15:20:59] <doug65536> grafi: yes but the first consideration is very valid if you do ajax request
[15:21:24] <grafi> but doesnt every keydown have a keyup?
[15:21:29] <doug65536> no
[15:21:29] <grafi> oh
[15:21:32] <grafi> yeah
[15:21:35] <grafi> kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
[15:21:36] <grafi> :P
[15:21:38] <doug65536> if you hold it, you get 1 at the end :)
[15:21:47] <grafi> i just realized :P
[15:21:52] <grafi> coolio
[15:22:03] <grafi> now im going to search my scripts for keydown ...
[15:23:09] <Manusoftar> this is my actual code but it doesn't seem to be working -> http://pastebin.com/aw1UMR5B i placed a breakpoint on the first line of keyPressed function and it is never reached!
[15:24:11] <grafi> funnily enough I have always used keyup ... without thinking about it
[15:43:48] <doug65536> Manusoftar: where is that code exactly?
[15:43:55] <doug65536> Manusoftar: in a file included in head?
[15:44:06] <Manusoftar> directly on the head
[15:44:14] <doug65536> the inputs don't exist yet
[15:44:42] <doug65536> Manusoftar: http://pastebin.com/991yYnuC
[15:44:49] <Manusoftar> perhaps i should call the first instruction throught body ->onLoad??
[15:45:01] <doug65536> my pastebin runs that code when the document is ready
[15:45:36] <doug65536> Manusoftar: $(function() { ... this runs when document is ready ... });
[15:45:41] <doug65536> Manusoftar: never use attributes for events
[15:46:03] <Manusoftar> like $(document).ready(setListener); -> function setListener(){ $("input").on("keyup",keyPressed); }
[15:46:19] <doug65536> Manusoftar: look at the pastebin I wrote for you
[15:46:23] <Manusoftar> ok
[15:46:55] <doug65536> Manusoftar: your code pollutes the global object
[15:47:17] <doug65536> Manusoftar: fixed http://pastebin.com/aF4in8di
[15:47:44] <doug65536> Manusoftar: evento was actually creating window.evento that lasts forever
[15:48:53] <doug65536> Manusoftar: you are getting the event data wrong
[15:49:13] <doug65536> Manusoftar: you don't need to do that ie compatibility crap when you use jquery
[15:49:22] <doug65536> Manusoftar: no need for window.event
[15:49:25] <Manusoftar> i'm going to try this approach, it just didnt seemed to even enter onto that function
[15:49:38] <Manusoftar> what should i use instead?
[15:49:42] <doug65536> just use 3
[15:49:44] <doug65536> e
[15:49:51] <Manusoftar> what?
[15:50:37] <doug65536> Manusoftar: no need for that internet explorer garbage with jquery event handler: http://pastebin.com/WgkRiajA
[15:51:31] <doug65536> Manusoftar: ie garbage = e || window.event and that srcElement crap :)
[15:51:50] <doug65536> Manusoftar: jquery makes them work the standard way even on ie
[15:52:12] <Manusoftar> i'm beggining to love jquery XD
[15:53:36] <doug65536> Manusoftar: also, keyCode is wrong. jquery makes it always be event.which
[15:54:16] <doug65536> Manusoftar: http://pastebin.com/GHf1ibRh
[15:54:42] <doug65536> Manusoftar: jquery "normalizes" events so they can be handled consistently across browsers
[15:54:48] <Manusoftar> anyway it doesn't seem to even enter on the keyPressed function, i'm using the developer bar on firefox and setting a breakpoint at the very first line on that function and it just wont pause, like it is never executed!!
[15:56:09] <Manusoftar> if you want to check it live you can go to http://www.smon.com.ar then press the first "button" and finally on the next page the second one!
[15:56:24] <doug65536> Manusoftar: http://jsfiddle.net/dzZzK/
[15:57:23] <doug65536> Manusoftar: are you expecting to get tab keypresses?
[15:57:33] <Manusoftar> sure!
[15:57:40] <doug65536> Manusoftar: you're doing it wrong
[15:57:46] <Manusoftar> when you change from one input to another one
[15:58:14] <Manusoftar> it works on the sample you posted with tabs
[15:58:36] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/dzZzK/2/
[15:58:49] <doug65536> what if they leave the field with a click though?
[15:59:35] <Manusoftar> i also catch the onBlur event separatedly
[16:00:05] <doug65536> Manusoftar: why
[16:00:32] <doug65536> Manusoftar: what does evalData do?
[16:00:34] <Manusoftar> mi idea was that while you are typing your desired username it checks if it is available and as soon as it becomes unavailable it will show the message
[16:00:39] <doug65536> that's probably doing it the hard way too
[16:01:13] <doug65536> then why have "if it is tab" in there
[16:01:36] <Manusoftar> let's say the username manusoft is already used but the username manu is not, then while you are typing manu nothing happends, but as soon as you reached the point where you typed manusoft it should show that it is already used
[16:03:09] <Manusoftar> evalData implementation -> http://pastebin.com/dLv6KcvG
[16:03:56] <Manusoftar> of course verifyname and verifyMail do call an AJAX function to call a php that will look for the username or email onto the mysql database
[16:04:49] <doug65536> msg = document.getElementById('userMsg');   <-- hard way - creates global var named msg that lasts forever
[16:05:04] <doug65536> var msg = $('#userMsg');       <-- easy way
[16:05:27] <doug65536> msg.innerHTML="El nombre de usuar....             becomes msg.html('El nombre...');
[16:05:32] <Manusoftar> so the use of var makes the variable local?
[16:05:37] <doug65536> yes
[16:05:43] <doug65536> msg.style.visibility="visible";      becomes msg.hide();
[16:05:45] <Manusoftar> i didn't know that
[16:06:05] <doug65536> Manusoftar: it is function scope, not block scope like C
[16:06:36] <Manusoftar> i thought that any variable defined on a function would be local by default, thanks for the advise
[16:07:00] <doug65536> no, design flaw of js, global by default :(
[16:07:21] <doug65536> "global" in a browser means, it adds a property to window
[16:07:32] <Manusoftar> oh i see!
[16:07:33] <doug65536> foo = 10     same thing as    window.foo = 10
[16:07:57] <Manusoftar> i'll begin to use var for now on!
[16:08:27] <doug65536> msg.style.visibility="visible";      becomes, obviously, msg.show()
[16:08:43] <doug65536> however, they are not exactly equivalent...
[16:09:01] <doug65536> .hide() makes it not affect the document at all
[16:09:34] <doug65536> for the purposes of appearance something you .hide() looks like it doesn't even exist on the screen
[16:09:36] <foo> doug65536: I am so much more than 10. Just sayin.
[16:09:56] <doug65536> foo: lol
[16:10:14] <grafi> how much more?
[16:10:20] <doug65536> foo: at least I'm not nailing you to windows
[16:10:28] <grafi> xD
[16:10:43] <grafi> I feel the sudden urge to rename myself to bar
[16:10:45] <foo> doug65536: Fair enough, I accept. :D
[16:11:00] <foo> grafi: The world may never know.
[16:11:08] <foo> I actually owned bar at one point, but it looks like I lost it.
[16:11:23] <grafi> hilarious
[16:11:33] <foo> (Not to be confused with "a bar")

[16:12:55] <doug65536> grafi: awesome
[16:14:00] <doug65536> I almost sprayed coffee out of my nose when it flopped around on its side and dumped the bowl completely out
[16:14:06] <grafi> fucking cats man
[16:14:07] <grafi> ^^
[16:14:43] <grafi> the post is titled "Trying to fix a bug in a system I didn't write"
[16:44:00] <fl0w> I'm adding select fields dynamically, and for some reason but initial $('select').change({â€¦}); doesn't seem be fired by the newly created selects?
[16:46:38] <fl0w> Do I need to reapply the change thing?
[16:47:52] <grafi> sounds like might want to append the eventhandler to a common parent
[16:48:13] <grafi> this way itll work for elements added to the dom later
[16:50:25] <fl0w> ah.
[16:50:38] <fl0w> makes sense.
[17:06:22] <RohanBhangui> hi i was wondering if anyone had a snippet for some code that would make a div rotate towards a mouse click using jquery and css3
[17:10:26] <LoneSoldier728> hey anyone here work with impress.js
[17:15:24] <gnarf> âœˆ AUS
[17:26:32] <giulia12> Ciao a tutti :)
[17:45:03] <grafi> RohanBhangui http://jsfiddle.net/6qEcN/1/
[17:45:40] <RohanBhangui> grafi: didnt think anyone heard that
[17:45:48] <RohanBhangui> thanks it solves 1 issue but what i mean
[17:46:00] <RohanBhangui> when i say rorate
[17:46:01] <RohanBhangui> *rotate
[17:46:08] <RohanBhangui> i mean like a compass rotion
[17:46:12] <RohanBhangui> *rotation
[17:46:16] <RohanBhangui> where the div is static
[17:46:29] <RohanBhangui> and it rotates towards the mouse click
[17:46:35] <RohanBhangui> sry i didnt mention this
[17:46:45] <grafi> hm interesting
[17:47:00] <grafi> so like an edge is pointing towards the mouse position?
[17:50:58] <sammich> so, I had this problem last night where my console.log was getting cleared out. Turns out it's just vBulletin and I wasn't being that thorough
[17:52:01] <sammich> although I don't understand what's happening, because it's setting console to an empty function when window.console is undefined
[17:52:25] <sammich> http://pastebin.com/wan3wH3d
[17:52:45] <sammich> but console is definitely there...
[17:52:49] <RohanBhangui> grafi: yes
[17:53:27] <RohanBhangui> grafi: think of the div as an arrow and where ever the mouse clicks that is where the arrow will point to
[17:54:15] <Ogredude> Is there a good way with jQuery to completely remove a CSS property that's placed by a stylesheet onto an element?
[17:54:49] <grafi> RohanBhangui so you just have to calc the angle
[17:54:53] <grafi> shouldnt be that hard
[17:54:56] <grafi> I think
[17:54:56] <grafi> :P
[17:54:59] <RohanBhangui> ya
[17:55:00] <RohanBhangui> i know
[17:55:03] <sammich> Ogredude: you can override a property
[17:55:16] <RohanBhangui> find the coordinate for center of div
[17:55:28] <RohanBhangui> and get mouseclick coordinates and then it should work
[17:55:30] <RohanBhangui> but for some reason it isnt
[17:55:39] <Ogredude> sammich: well, I've tried $(".main").css({'z-index':''}); and that doesn't do it
[17:55:45] <grafi> have a "working" example?
[17:55:53] <RohanBhangui> doing it right now
[17:55:57] <grafi> :P
[17:56:01] <Ogredude> I'm working with http://codepen.io/anon/pen/fguyi right now
[17:56:02] <sammich> Ogredude: try 0
[17:56:03] <RohanBhangui> does your browser allow you to emulate touch events?
[17:56:26] <Ogredude> since z-indexes inherit, any child element of .main will have z-index 0 as well.
[17:56:27] <sammich> where's the JS
[17:56:35] <Ogredude> sammich: the JS is the part I'm trying to work out
[17:56:54] <Ogredude> I need to either completely ditch the defined z-index on .main, or I need to pick up .message and move it to outside .main
[17:57:00] <Ogredude> those seem to be my two possible solutions.
[17:59:07] <Ogredude> the end result needs to have the message on top, then the overlay, then the rest of it
[17:59:14] <sammich> why is message inside the main?
[17:59:55] <sammich> you'd generally put floating elements outside of the container if it's not directly connected to that container
[18:00:10] <sammich> it, for boundary control
[18:00:12] <sammich> ie*
[18:00:35] <Ogredude> yeah I know, but it's stuck there by the software
[18:00:44] <Ogredude> it's being repurposed into a confirmation dialog
[18:00:44] <sammich> what software?
[18:00:49] <RohanBhangui> grafi: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/CdF9V/
[18:01:01] <RohanBhangui> grafi: when you see it youll think im crazy cause it works
[18:01:19] <Ogredude> sammich: Drupal
[18:01:30] <RohanBhangui> but the problem is if the angle is close to 360 and you click such that the angle is close to 0 then the arrow spins all the way around
[18:01:44] <RohanBhangui> grafi: make sure to emulate touch events
[18:01:49] <RohanBhangui> if using chrome
[18:04:20] <grafi> hm doesnt seem to work at all for me in firefox oÃ´
[18:04:37] <grafi> or is that because of the touchevent stuff?
[18:05:28] <sammich> Ogredude: you'll have to move that element out if you want to have an overlay
[18:05:48] <Ogredude> sammich: yeah that's what I was thinking
[18:06:18] <sammich> I'm not totally sure of this, but a single container is like one unit of layer
[18:06:31] <sammich> not sure if you can slot stuff between stuff inside a container
[18:10:25] <Ogredude> yeah, and it looks like anything inside that container is at the same layer
[18:10:43] <Ogredude> okay so it looks like I should be able to get away with $(".message").insertBefore(".main");
[18:10:50] <sammich> pretty much
[18:11:58] <RohanBhangui> grafi: touch event stuff
[18:13:03] <RohanBhangui> grafi: if you can use chrome (sry about this) then you can try it out
[18:13:09] <RohanBhangui> just enalbe the emulate touch events
[18:23:09] <LoneSoldier728> what size image is normal for a background image for a website
[18:24:02] <tw2113> is there a normal?
[18:24:47] <LoneSoldier728> well what is too big i guess
[18:24:52] <LoneSoldier728> because i dont want it to take long to load
[18:24:58] <kastang> full image, or pattern? If pattern make the smalles (in filesize and px) and just repeat x and y to populate
[18:24:59] <tw2113> something that takes 20s to download
[18:25:07] <RohanBhangui> LoneSoldier728: if the background can be repeatable do as such
[18:25:29] <LoneSoldier728> I want to have a picture of space
[18:25:33] <LoneSoldier728> and then a picture of earth
[18:25:35] <RohanBhangui> if its a single image than you wnat something maybe greater than 1200px
[18:25:39] <RohanBhangui> hieght
[18:25:46] <RohanBhangui> *height
[18:25:48] <sammich> hmm, then you want to have that as a 4MB image, mmm, yeah
[18:26:17] <LoneSoldier728> what dimensions
[18:26:22] <LoneSoldier728> 1200 and what : )
[18:26:23] <RohanBhangui> also reducing quality of image (eg when exporting in photoshop) also helps with laod times
[18:26:38] <RohanBhangui> well for exmaple i have a monitor
[18:26:41] <LoneSoldier728> ya i am trying to figure out what is the minimum quality and size
[18:26:45] <LoneSoldier728> before it looks like shit
[18:26:45] <RohanBhangui> that is 19000 x 1200
[18:26:51] <LoneSoldier728> because I want to use it for a resume
[18:26:53] <RohanBhangui> *1900
[18:27:19] <RohanBhangui> grafi: you still there?
[18:27:27] <LoneSoldier728> so 1900 x 1200 is good

[18:30:14] <RohanBhangui> LoneSoldier728: yes that is a good size
[18:30:22] <RohanBhangui> cause msot monitors these days sit at about 1366 * 768
[18:30:27] <RohanBhangui> grafi: lol
[18:30:43] <RohanBhangui> LoneSoldier728: and you wnat an image thats bigger than that
[18:31:02] <RohanBhangui> grafi: did the touch event stuff work now?
[18:31:39] <grafi> didnt try, have my own test thingie working in firefox
[18:31:40] <grafi> :)
[18:33:21] <RohanBhangui> lol okay as long as it works
[18:33:53] <RohanBhangui> grafi: let me know if you have any questions regarding my code
[18:35:10] <grafi> hm so I think starting to calc the quadrant is the right way
[18:35:38] <grafi> after that it should be a walk in the park
[18:40:23] <RohanBhangui> problem with the quadrant
[18:40:35] <RohanBhangui> what should be quadrant 4 is considered quadrant 1
[18:41:18] <RohanBhangui> grafi: there should be some way to specify the direction of rotation (CW vs. CCW)
[18:44:46] <RohanBhangui> grafi: i might have figured it out take a look at this snippet change the -360 to 360 and the direction changes: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/PuQZN/
[18:45:51] <grafi> yeah thats kind of what im trying right now :P
[18:46:20] <RohanBhangui> see the atan2 returns a radian value
[18:46:36] <RohanBhangui> which i have converted to deg cause that is what i assumed rotate() accepts
[18:46:42] <RohanBhangui> so
[18:47:17] <RohanBhangui> what we need to do is get the previous rotation and find the shortest "rotation distance"
[18:47:35] <grafi> sounds good
[18:48:12] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: it's simpler than that. if you're past 180, then go the rest of the way, if <= 180, go back
[18:48:23] <RohanBhangui> true
[18:48:58] <RohanBhangui> doug65536: want to look at the fiddle?
[18:49:05] <RohanBhangui> see if you can help
[18:49:06] <sammich> dammit, I love you css transitions
[18:49:13] <doug65536> sure
[18:51:06] <RohanBhangui> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/CdF9V/  mind you i hope you can emulate touch events
[18:51:11] <RohanBhangui> cuase thats how this thing runs
[18:51:27] <RohanBhangui> sammich: ?
[18:52:39] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: you don't need to do all those calls to css with the prefix - jquery handles that for you
[18:52:56] <RohanBhangui> oh
[18:54:27] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: does .on('touchstart', ... ) not work?
[18:54:41] <RohanBhangui> i guess i can use that
[18:54:53] <RohanBhangui> but that isnt the issue
[18:54:54] <doug65536> I don't know if it works, was wondering
[18:54:58] <doug65536> I know
[18:55:01] <RohanBhangui> it probably does
[18:55:32] <doug65536> I am blocked right now - I need to put in mouse compatibility or something to test it
[18:55:58] <doug65536> touchstart = mousedown. touchmove = mousemove but only between mousedown and mouseup
[18:56:56] <RohanBhangui> ?
[18:57:10] <RohanBhangui> if using chrome jsut emulate touch events in console settings
[18:57:14] <doug65536> surprise! I'm using a computer
[18:57:40] <RohanBhangui> what browser?
[18:57:43] <doug65536> yeah maybe I can, but can your average user that uses this?
[18:58:35] <RohanBhangui> its meant for mobile so
[18:58:37] <RohanBhangui> im assuming yes
[18:58:46] <RohanBhangui> given that most mobile browsers use webkit
[18:58:51] <RohanBhangui> and support css3
[18:59:35] <doug65536> I enabled touch event emulation. not working
[18:59:47] <grafi> doug65536 in the meantime maybe this works http://jsfiddle.net/mstoppert/JajkA/2/
[19:00:23] <RohanBhangui> grafi: you dick :P had to go out there and be smart :P jks
[19:00:35] <grafi> :D
[19:00:57] <RohanBhangui> lol thanks for that\
[19:02:20] <grafi> i hope its jsut because its 4am, but I feel kind of dumb right now :P
[19:02:34] <Manusoftar> is there any alternative to the onBlur method to detect when the user changes from one input to another using the mouse, cause the onBlur method will fire even if i minimize the browser or just get some other window on focus??
[19:02:37] <RohanBhangui> lol atleast you figured it out kind of
[19:03:09] <RohanBhangui> Manusoftar: test whether other inputs are in focus
[19:03:48] <doug65536> key thing is, that calculation will always give you an angle between -180 and +180
[19:04:16] <RohanBhangui> yes
[19:04:32] <doug65536> I think I know what to do...
[19:04:41] <RohanBhangui> lead the way
[19:05:16] <grafi> yeah thats when I started fixing it, then it doesnt work the other way around :d
[19:05:19] <grafi> hrhr
[19:06:51] <hazardous> CWSpear: sorry i kidna lost internet <CWSpear> hazardous, it make be that synchronous requests just are odd. I know some frameworks specifically don't allow for synchronous requests
[19:07:00] <hazardous> i basically need it to fire one at a time, some way
[19:07:09] <hazardous> it can be async, but i would need some kind of bizarro worker/queue thing then
[19:07:15] <hazardous> i wasn't aware that it would freeze the browser entirely
[19:07:17] <RohanBhangui> is there a way to set the value so that what ever value that we get thats between -180 and 180 to be between 0-360
[19:07:29] <RohanBhangui> like conver tthe value
[19:07:30] <hazardous> but i need 1000 http requests to take 1500 seconds (or more) to complete
[19:07:33] <RohanBhangui> *convert
[19:07:49] <CWSpear> hazardous, you can use callbacks to chain, or else use deferred or promises or whatever jQuery calls them
[19:09:51] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/JajkA/3/
[19:09:55] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: ^
[19:10:28] <RohanBhangui> :D
[19:10:31] <RohanBhangui> explain
[19:11:09] <doug65536> it computes the angle that it would need to be if it went clockwise, and the angle it would need to be if it went counterclockwise...
[19:11:21] <doug65536> then it calculates which way has less difference from the current angle
[19:11:37] <doug65536> and uses lowest angle difference for the new angle
[19:12:39] <doug65536> hold on, it's not perfect...
[19:13:05] <grafi> well thats what I wanted to do :D
[19:13:49] <Tingle> anyone here that gets paid for making websites and can maybe tell me how much the work I have done/will do is worth?
[19:14:01] <doug65536> there's an issue around 9 oclock
[19:14:20] <RohanBhangui> doug65536: what do you mean
[19:14:31] <grafi> works fine for me :o
[19:14:45] <RohanBhangui> i see it doug
[19:15:55] <grafi> i dont, but thats ok :)
[19:16:37] <grafi> Tingle dont do work and calculate afterwards what its worth
[19:17:00] <Tingle> what
[19:17:18] <Tingle> dont do work?
[19:17:41] <RohanBhangui> grafi: that depends
[19:17:46] <RohanBhangui> if he is doing it for a client
[19:18:02] <RohanBhangui> or if he/she is looking to have clients find them
[19:18:11] <Tingle> client/stepmother/taxconsultant
[19:18:24] <Tingle> Im trying to put a price on what she wants
[19:18:43] <grafi> your stepmother is your taxconsultant? xP
[19:19:07] <grafi> and what does she want?
[19:19:13] <Tingle> eh motherinlaw
[19:19:19] <Tingle> :P w/e
[19:19:21] <Tingle> um
[19:20:13] <Tingle> its a site where you can compare tax laws in different countries
[19:21:16] <Tingle> with a user and message system for other tax consultants that help fill the database with their tax laws/info and where also people that are looking for tax consultants can find them
[19:21:57] <Tingle> sorta hard to explain
[19:22:24] <Tingle> everything done from scratch
[19:22:58] <grafi> sounds expensive to me :P
[19:23:04] <RohanBhangui> well in temrs of pricing
[19:23:09] <RohanBhangui> *terms of pricing
[19:23:17] <RohanBhangui> depends on if you hate or like the person
[19:23:22] <RohanBhangui> :P
[19:23:41] <Tingle> also designed properly by a graphic designer(my wife) which is included in the price
[19:24:28] <Tingle> is 5000$ to much?
[19:24:34] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: got it, I think http://jsfiddle.net/JajkA/4/
[19:24:56] <RohanBhangui> what did you fix?
[19:25:28] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: first it figures out how many complete rotations away from zero we are and adjusts angleInDegrees accordingly
[19:25:43] <RohanBhangui> okay
[19:25:43] <RohanBhangui> cool
[19:26:30] <grafi> Tingle i can see this quickly going down the rabbit hole
[19:26:52] <Tingle> what do you mean
[19:26:57] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: oops...
[19:27:02] <RohanBhangui> ?
[19:27:04] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: oops... deleted the line with var
[19:27:13] <RohanBhangui> repost?
[19:27:22] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: wait, nevermind lol. I'm getting tired too :)
[19:27:46] <RohanBhangui> oh ya gonna make me go through your code huh
[19:27:48] <doug65536> lastactualangle not needed on line 1
[19:27:49] <RohanBhangui> i see how it is :P
[19:28:23] <doug65536> :)
[19:28:31] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/JajkA/5/
[19:28:32] <Tingle> well is there any kind of price range what I decribed would fit into?
[19:28:54] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: yes
[19:28:59] <RohanBhangui> kk
[19:29:05] <grafi> well first you need accounts for tax consultants, than accounts for user, suddenly you need to manage the profiles, then a database scheme (are international tax laws even comparable that easily?) and then a full blown messaging system from scratch, ignore users, some spam protection etc etc etc, its quickly going to grow as you code along
[19:29:28] <RohanBhangui> Tingle: it depends on how big of a project it is gonna be for you
[19:29:35] <grafi> i think you should first set up very clear boundaries of what is needed/included in what you deliver
[19:29:39] <RohanBhangui> if it requires you to learn new things
[19:29:47] <grafi> then estimate how long it will take you
[19:29:49] <RohanBhangui> i agree with grafi
[19:29:51] <grafi> double that
[19:30:05] <Tingle> I had to learn everything from scratch, Im a c++ programmer normaly.
[19:30:09] <grafi> and set an hourly rate that you are willing to work for I guess
[19:30:11] <doug65536> "double it" rule is wise
[19:30:14] <Tingle> and im about half way done with the site
[19:30:37] <Tingle> but im not wanting to charge for me not knowing how to code web stuff. so thats on me
[19:30:40] <grafi> and how long did it take you?
[19:30:45] <Tingle> so far?
[19:30:48] <grafi> yes
[19:31:15] <grafi> or rather, what is still missing
[19:31:18] <Tingle> about 2 weeks so far, 10-12h a day
[19:31:30] <grafi> wow
[19:31:32] <Tingle> 6d/w
[19:31:39] <grafi> thats commitment
[19:31:55] <Tingle> most of my time went into learning new stuff, messing with crap not workingand IE being a bitch
[19:32:22] <Tingle> but everything was done on a professional level I think - security, spam protection, etc
[19:32:32] <grafi> so lets say it takes you another 2 weeks / 132 hours
[19:33:06] <grafi> then you're working for 18$ an hour?
[19:33:13] <grafi> or is my math completely wrong
[19:33:39] <Tingle> mm let me calc that
[19:33:51] <Tingle> lets say 10h a day,
[19:34:06] <Tingle> 240h so
[19:34:09] <Tingle> for 4 weeks
[19:34:32] <Tingle> thats a 20$/h pay I have recieved so far
[19:34:36] <Tingle> is that alot?
[19:34:39] <visua> that's pretty cheap for web dev
[19:34:46] <RohanBhangui> Tingle: the question how much, excuse the phrase, is busting your balls worth?
[19:34:48] <visua> like, way cheap ;)
[19:34:51] <grafi> well depending on your country etc
[19:34:53] <grafi> but yeah
[19:34:58] <grafi> its kinda very cheap
[19:35:03] <visua> yea
[19:35:10] <RohanBhangui> doug65536: works with touch events thanks :D
[19:35:18] <Tingle> well considering I went unexperienced into the whole thing and most of the time went into learning...
[19:35:27] <grafi> yeah doug65536 good work buddy
[19:35:30] <RohanBhangui> Tingle: how is this discussion about jquery?
[19:35:35] <visua> Tingle I supposed if you got paid 20$ an hour to learn something new, then it works out.
[19:35:49] <doug65536> :)
[19:35:51] <Tingle> so maybe 2-3 weeks effective time
[19:35:57] <visua> But if you're a pro, you should be closer to $100~/hr
[19:36:05] <RohanBhangui> Tingle: no one pays for your learning they pay for what you produce/ what they get
[19:36:07] <visua> of course depending on the client
[19:36:27] <Tingle> mm ok
[19:36:39] <Tingle> so what would a family/friend $/h be?
[19:36:56] <visua> I refer friends to other colleauges
[19:37:07] <grafi> thats a good policy
[19:37:23] <visua> Its too easy to not get paid or sell yourself short.
[19:37:35] <RohanBhangui> yh
[19:37:56] <Tingle> does 30$ sound right or is that way to cheap?
[19:37:57] <visua> But, I still do a cheap rate for small stuff for referrals of family friends type of thing, usually 45-80$/hr depending on the project
[19:38:08] <Tingle> k
[19:38:21] <Tingle> thanks for the info, think I got an idae now
[19:38:31] <grafi> :)
[19:38:53] <grafi> visua will always work for a cold beer
[19:38:55] <grafi> :D
[19:39:00] <visua> true dattt
[19:39:04] <RohanBhangui> lol
[19:39:14] <RohanBhangui> Tingle 1 last question
[19:39:19] <Tingle> yea?
[19:39:25] <visua> as long as it's a good beer, of course!
[19:39:43] <grafi> so not american beer?
[19:39:44] <grafi> :P
[19:39:49] <visua> pssh.
[19:39:51] <RohanBhangui> what the hell did your question have to do with jquery ? :P
[19:39:55] <visua> America has fantastic beer.
[19:40:05] <visua> We don't export our crafts, though.
[19:40:07] <Tingle> mm jquery has to do with web development :P?
[19:40:21] <Tingle> and I hang around here during work time/day
[19:40:26] <grafi> im not convinced visua though of courseive never tasted it
[19:40:27] <grafi> :P
[19:40:32] <Tingle> #html and äphp are unaccessable
[19:40:36] <visua> Most people associate american beer with the big inbev/coors/whatever brands that's just water with some beer added in
[19:40:49] <visua> grafi we have a very vibrant craft brewery industry in the U.S.
[19:41:18] <grafi> thats also true for iceland
[19:41:20] <grafi> i think
[19:41:22] <grafi> whatever
[19:41:40] <grafi> if you like it, i trust your judgement
[19:41:42] <visua> I hope to visit Iceland.
[19:43:05] <Tingle> one more question grafi, what would the normal development time be for such a site?
[19:43:23] <Tingle> with people who know what they are doing
[19:43:35] <RohanBhangui> the timeline
[19:43:41] <RohanBhangui> is dependant
[19:43:44] <RohanBhangui> on difficulty
[19:43:58] <grafi> im a little suspicious that you only spent 4 weeks on it, alone, with learning ...
[19:43:59] <RohanBhangui> that is something that varies based on developer
[19:44:13] <Tingle> is that to long?
[19:44:38] <doug65536> I got banned from #html for asking "does anyone know if there's a workaround for glitchy transforms when animating in firefox on linux"
[19:45:05] <grafi> haha @ doug65536
[19:45:13] <Tingle> im a experienced programmer and working myself into new languages and frameworks/sdk's/api's is what I do :O
[19:45:16] <doug65536> thankfully I already know that <br> doesn't need a closing tag :D
[19:46:00] <grafi> Tingle yeah that probably works in your favor
[19:46:30] <Tingle> but your sayng someone without the need of learning who knows web development would take more than 4 weeks?
[19:46:47] <grafi> I would have estimated something north of 4 weeks, but then again I have no real idea about the "specs" of the project
[19:46:56] <RohanBhangui> true
[19:47:05] <RohanBhangui> and that too working alot of hours a day
[19:47:21] <grafi> maybe Tingle is just a rockstar
[19:47:22] <grafi> :D
[19:47:26] <Tingle> :P
[19:47:38] <Tingle> how many hours does someone normaly work?
[19:47:40] <RohanBhangui> doug65536: rotation works like a charm if this smily emoticon could make a bigger smile than i would put that :)
[19:47:41] <Tingle> 8h/d?
[19:47:42] <grafi> so Tingle how many tests did you write?
[19:47:51] <sammich> pfft, tests
[19:47:52] <Tingle> tests?
[19:47:56] <Tingle> prototypes?
[19:47:58] <Tingle> none
[19:47:59] <grafi> and what language did you use?
[19:48:00] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: nice
[19:48:10] <grafi> sammich: haha
[19:48:19] <doug65536> my 2 cents: if you are good at coding stuff, if you team up with someone good at html/css you can get stuff done really fast
[19:48:30] <grafi> true doug65536
[19:48:30] <Tingle> html/html5/css/javscript/php/jquery/ajax
[19:48:35] <Tingle> the whole works I guess
[19:48:36] <Tingle> mysql
[19:48:44] <sammich> english
[19:48:49] <grafi> and you learned php with this project?
[19:49:01] <Tingle> all of those
[19:49:05] <grafi> i think sammich is drunk
[19:49:09] <RohanBhangui> lol
[19:49:22] <sammich> that's not the first time I've been accused of that today
[19:49:34] <grafi> so what about pdo, tingle?
[19:49:43] <Tingle> pdo....
[19:49:47] <Tingle> thats a db thing?
[19:49:51] <grafi> yup
[19:49:56] <Tingle> rings a bell
[19:49:59] <grafi> prepared statements and such?
[19:50:03] <Tingle> but no, only mysql
[19:50:29] <visua> i loathe doing backend stuff these days
[19:50:54] <grafi> na visua thats the fun part :D
[19:50:54] <visua> not my cup of tea
[19:51:05] <visua> Not for me!
[19:51:21] <Tingle> what do you mean with prepared statements
[19:51:29] <doug65536> uh oh
[19:51:37] <grafi> alarm bells ringing :D
[19:51:54] <doug65536> Tingle: have you read about little timmy tables?
[19:51:54] <Tingle> anti hijackable queries?
[19:52:16] <grafi> anti sql injection attacks
[19:52:21] <Tingle> yeah
[19:52:23] <Tingle> I did that
[19:52:30] <visua> pffft. I let my apps be hackable
[19:52:41] <grafi> thats good, i guess

[19:53:12] <visua> why :(
[19:53:23] <grafi> i like you too much already
[19:53:25] <Tingle> yeah no, I made my queries un-injectable
[19:53:33] <Tingle> and captcha crap
[19:53:34] <visua> Well that's fair.
[19:53:36] <Tingle> against spam
[19:53:43] <grafi> sounds good
[19:53:47] <RohanBhangui> lol grafi response to visua

[19:54:40] <doug65536> Tingle: with a different huge random salt per record I hope
[19:54:42] <Tingle> no
[19:54:42] * visua resists hash storage joke.
[19:54:50] <Tingle> thats undoable with that rainbow stuff
[19:54:55] <grafi> give in visua
[19:54:58] <Tingle> the rainbow table I think its called
[19:54:58] <grafi> you want it

[19:55:03] <grafi> i know <.<
[19:55:04] <Tingle> is what I used
[19:55:05] <RohanBhangui> .hash()
[19:55:09] <grafi> im testing him here :P
[19:55:15] <RohanBhangui> lol okay
[19:55:17] <Tingle> think its based on blowfish
[19:55:18] <RohanBhangui> i wanna play too :P
[19:55:34] <grafi> thats cool
[19:55:42] <doug65536> Tingle: blowfish? where do you store the key?
[19:55:52] <Tingle> on the server
[19:55:56] <doug65536> Tingle: blowfish is encryption, not hashing
[19:56:03] <Tingle> oh k
[19:56:10] <Tingle> I use the phpass framwork
[19:56:23] <doug65536> Tingle: well, the attacker will just read your source code, get the decryption key and he has everyone's password
[19:56:43] <Tingle> but its not on the client, phpass is as the name suggests, php - which is server side :O?

[19:57:11] <visua> this channel right now ^
[19:57:13] <doug65536> Tingle: salted hashes are so strong that he can't get anyone's password even if you give him the ftp password and help him understand the source. YOU can't even get their passwords
[19:57:49] <grafi> https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DBtkKURAv74/UitdK4n0goI/AAAAAAAANaY/Nm3bz4GCLII/w381-h255/I+Dont+Think+That+is+How+You+Drink+Milk.gif me right now
[19:57:52] <Tingle> dont realy get where you are going :O?
[19:58:07] <Tingle> the password is stored encrypted in the db
[19:58:09] <visua> grafi you're a lot smaller and cuter than I imagined
[19:58:17] <doug65536> Tingle: if you encrypt passwords on a website, you are essentially locking the door and putting the key under the front door mat
[19:58:19] <grafi> i get that a lot
[19:58:41] <Tingle> the password is sent to the server and encrypted there
[19:59:14] <visua> Tingle why don't you fire up a server and deploy this app, and let these guys try to break it?
[19:59:27] <visua> It's a fun way to test stuff.
[19:59:36] <grafi> xD
[19:59:54] <grafi> mission impossible style
[19:59:55] <visua> We actually do it at work, though its generally an internal activity haha.
[20:00:11] <Tingle> :P
[20:00:29] <visua> Consider it part of the QA phase, hell you can even bill for penetration testing.
[20:00:31] <visua> :)
[20:00:36] <grafi> hang down from the ventilator shaft hacking into terminals?
[20:00:41] <Tingle> think doug just had a wrong impression, I dont do anything on the client, im not stupid :P
[20:00:46] <visua> grafi is that not normal?
[20:00:50] <visua> That's how I work at my desk
[20:00:52] <grafi> you must work for a cool company
[20:00:59] <grafi> hm
[20:01:00] <visua> I do work at a cool company

[20:01:05] <grafi> cool

[20:01:13] <visua> literally the AC is on all the time :|
[20:01:20] <doug65536> Tingle: here's the data in my user table. salt=dea7e68c5945d95a401f507253b6c4da9e2a471cb3318cb030a7a7e49a54a720, password=97d8dd0b6014833a79c545c7c3dda9e0976bd9a3065f82a24fead18a47b94d6d
[20:01:24] <grafi> hahaha
[20:01:32] <doug65536> Tingle: tell me the password. I'll give you a billion years

[20:01:49] <grafi> :D
[20:01:51] <Tingle> ^^
[20:01:52] <doug65536> nope
[20:02:09] <grafi> it even says password, you cant fool me
[20:02:22] <Tingle> ill have to go with grafi on this one
[20:02:26] <Tingle> :P
[20:02:36] <doug65536> unfortunately, the sun will envelop the earth before you brute force that
[20:02:53] <doug65536> it'll be a white dwarf
[20:04:24] <grafi> hm
[20:04:27] <doug65536> Tingle: what I'm trying to tell you is, all I can do is check that you sent me the correct password. it is impossible for me to figure out what the password is from the database
[20:04:36] <grafi> so what else can go wrong
[20:04:49] <Tingle> yeah I know, thats what I do
[20:05:16] <grafi> phpass (pronounced "pH pass") is a portable public domain password hashing framework for use in PHP applications.
[20:05:26] <grafi> calm down doug65536 :D
[20:05:36] <doug65536> lol
[20:05:38] <Tingle> http://spottedsun.com/phpass-tutorial/
[20:05:40] <Tingle> theres an example
[20:05:46] <Tingle> on how the framework works
[20:05:48] <visua> phpAss is more apt.
[20:06:18] <Tingle> is something wrong with phpass?
[20:06:42] <Tingle> thought it was one of the most secure methods of handeling passwords
[20:07:50] <grafi> I think doug65536 agrees
[20:07:51] <grafi> :P
[20:07:56] <Tingle> ^^
[20:07:59] <Tingle> anyway
[20:08:22] <grafi> dont forget to give us a link when the site is up
[20:08:42] <Tingle> pmed you
[20:08:54] <doug65536> I didn't use phpass fwiw
[20:08:57] <grafi> Tingle ~tingle@p5DC56B2A.dip0.t-ipconnect.de is messaging you, and you have umode +g.
[20:08:59] <grafi> hihi

[20:09:26] <Tingle> I cant pm you

[20:10:50] <grafi> ...
[20:11:11] <visua> I've been binge watching Band of Brothers
[20:11:19] <grafi> wohooo
[20:14:30] <doug65536> well, in actuality, you could brute force it...
[20:14:53] <grafi> or I just try 12345
[20:14:54] <doug65536> but you would need to do each password separately, there's no rainbow table for it
[20:14:55] <grafi> and it works
[20:14:57] <grafi> oÃ´
[20:15:31] <doug65536> there's no magical way to make short passwords secure
[20:15:49] <visua> rainbow table...
[20:15:59] <grafi> rainbow party

[20:16:19] <grafi> you're full of surprises
[20:16:39] <visua> and the hat goes deeper.
[20:17:11] <visua> I was hoping to have a productive night working on some projects, but that just didn't happen.
[20:17:21] <grafi> lazy
[20:17:23] <grafi> like me
[20:17:29] <visua> yeah, pretty much.
[20:17:31] <grafi> i rotated some divs around
[20:17:38] <visua> I need to paint my loft tomorrow I think and work on that.
[20:17:56] <doug65536> visua: nope that rainbow table didn't work. 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 left to go
[20:18:09] <visua> doug65536 damn, I was pretty close though.
[20:18:42] <grafi> the password is doug65536
[20:19:22] <grafi> besides phishing is the way to go for credentials
[20:19:31] <grafi> cant protect against stupid
[20:19:32] <grafi> ^^
[20:20:04] <doug65536> honestly, who here *actually* has a password of 20 characters of a-zA-Z0-9 and symbols
[20:20:05] <visua> That's the most effective way.
[20:20:31] <visua> One time to illustrate this point, I setup a very basic phishing scheme
[20:20:41] <visua> And got a bunch of FB passwords.
[20:21:18] <visua> None of my friends answer my emails anymore ;)
[20:21:50] <grafi> doug65536 me
[20:21:55] <grafi> and not just one
[20:21:58] <grafi> :P
[20:22:15] <visua> It was completely noob style as well. I just saved out Facebook.com, changed the form submit to post to a db on my server, uploaded them page and then sent a link to my friends...
[20:22:17] <doug65536> 3.14159265358979323?
[20:22:25] <visua> dumbasses actually tried logging in.
[20:22:27] <visua> :|
[20:23:21] <grafi> thats every user though visua ^^
[20:23:37] <doug65536> visua: yeah but how savvy is your typical facebook addict?
[20:23:41] <visua> Yeah, but I didn't even hide the url at all.. it was myserver.com/facebook
[20:23:58] <visua> Yeah, I suppose.
[20:24:06] <doug65536> aka the magical world of endless scrolling
[20:24:10] <visua> It was kind of sad :[
[20:24:58] <visua> magical world of endless scrolling?
[20:25:02] <doug65536> facebook
[20:25:07] <grafi> i wonder how much success you would have on github
[20:25:08] <grafi> ...
[20:25:09] <visua> Ohh
[20:25:16] <sammich> 1password
[20:25:18] <visua> grafi that would probably be relatively low.
[20:26:11] <visua> Althought i've seen repos with api keys left in.
[20:26:24] <visua> Wich isn't super bad I guess, but still.
[20:26:37] <grafi> every 2 weeks someine searches for sql injection vuln
[20:26:42] <grafi> and posts it on reddit
[20:27:28] <doug65536> I did a feature request for regex search on github... not really feasible I guess but if they implement it it could be used to scan for vulnerabilities
[20:27:42] <grafi> regex oÃ´
[20:27:51] <grafi> what would you search for?
[20:28:08] <doug65536> the request was to be able to grep a repository in search field
[20:28:23] <doug65536> but if they implemented it across public projects it could get ugly
[20:28:23] <visua> I really need to buy this irc app..the trial version kicks me off every 45 min or something
[20:28:32] <visua> or I should just install irssi again
[20:28:45] <sammich> yeah, it's not like regex isn't expensive at all
[20:29:29] <grafi> still what would you search for Ã´Ã´
[20:29:32] <doug65536> yeah, as I said, barely feasible, but it could extract literals from the regex and if sufficient, use that in the fulltext search, then grep those
[20:30:07] <doug65536> search for lines that have where and a $ after it in the same line
[20:30:17] <sammich> now, if only there was a index to enable fast regex
[20:30:25] <doug65536> ... where i_am_dumb = "$idiot"
[20:30:38] <sammich> (I know, I know)
[20:32:34] <doug65536> sammich: there is, if there is sufficient literal matching going on in the regex - first fulltext the literal segments and grep those matches
[20:33:08] <doug65536> but yes, barely feasible
[20:33:16] <grafi> https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Aphp+mysql+WHERE+%24_GET&type=Code&ref=searchresults
[20:33:51] <doug65536> awful :(
[20:34:09] <doug65536> wow I overestimated people
[20:34:41] <visua> About time i finally bought this app
[20:34:43] <grafi> never do that

[20:34:50] <grafi> what app visua

[20:36:11] <doug65536> nice, people are filing vulnerability bugs
[20:36:20] <peepsalot> how can i avoid text selection when clicking and dragging using jquery?
[20:36:44] <visua> peepsalot css
[20:36:46] <visua> user-select: none;
[20:36:54] <doug65536> peepsalot: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select
[20:37:14] <doug65536> peepsalot: in your css file or .css('user-select', 'none')
[20:37:35] <visua> Yeah I don't see why you would want to do that via js.
[20:37:50] <doug65536> visua: the content might be completely generated by js
[20:38:00] <visua> doug65536 ah, right.
[20:38:08] <grafi> doug65536 is completely generated by js
[20:38:13] <visua> Wich is something i'm pretty interest in.

[20:39:47] <RohanBhangui> hey does anyone know how to chain css3 trasnformations
[20:39:59] <RohanBhangui> qould i just hav to use seperate classes
[20:40:07] <RohanBhangui> and then use jquer yot add
[20:40:11] <RohanBhangui> *jquery to add
[20:40:12] <sammich> wow, an actual jquery question
[20:40:15] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: yes, transform: translate(...) rotate(..) etc etc
[20:40:18] <visua> RohanBhangui theres an event
[20:40:25] <visua> webkitTransitionEnd
[20:40:33] <RohanBhangui> ahhh
[20:40:36] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: oh I thought you meant translate then rotate then scale etc
[20:40:41] <visua> CAn you do it in pure css? I have no idea.
[20:40:43] <RohanBhangui> no
[20:40:45] <RohanBhangui> like
[20:40:47] <RohanBhangui> i want to
[20:40:51] <RohanBhangui> rotate something
[20:41:00] <RohanBhangui> then after the rotation is complete
[20:41:03] <RohanBhangui> translate that same something
[20:41:14] <doug65536> RohanBhangui: yeah, what visua said - or keyframing
[20:41:16] <visua> Dude, do what I do. I create all my rich animations in Adobe Edge then pass it over to a front end dev to figure out
[20:41:19] <visua> MUHAHAHA!
[20:41:27] <RohanBhangui> sure
[20:41:36] <grafi> how ... edgy
[20:41:40] <RohanBhangui> any solution i can use right now
[20:41:44] <visua> nice one grafi
[20:41:48] <doug65536> visua: he must love you
[20:41:56] <grafi> yeah, i thought of that one by myself
[20:42:00] <grafi> i think it shows
[20:42:01] <visua> doug65536 keyframing is still pretty weak thought right
[20:42:10] <visua> doug65536 uh, i get along well with my team :)
[20:42:19] <RohanBhangui> ?
[20:42:19] <grafi> is it?
[20:42:26] <doug65536> visua: haven't bothered with keyframing yet but iirc it is for what rohan asks
[20:42:26] <RohanBhangui> hey guys a bit off topic
[20:42:29] <RohanBhangui> any help
[20:42:43] <visua> Yeah I think it is too
[20:42:52] <visua> RohanBhangui http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2794148/css3-transition-events
[20:42:56] <visua> JS way of doing it
[20:42:58] <doug65536> visua: honestly I would do it in code too
[20:43:02] <peepsalot> visua, i want it so that if you click from within an svg element, then drag outside of it, it won't select things, but still allow selection otherwise.  that is why i wanted to use javascript
[20:43:16] <peepsalot> anyways I tried setting user-select:none on body and it still selects
[20:43:38] <RohanBhangui> alright thanks
[20:43:40] <visua> This is probably bad practice, but try *{ user-select: none }
[20:43:51] <visua> and try the vendor prefixes too
[20:43:53] <grafi> "probably"
[20:43:55] <grafi> hahahaha
[20:43:55] <grafi> xD
[20:43:59] <RohanBhangui> lol
[20:44:02] <doug65536> visua: hopefully there aren't any input fields :D
[20:44:06] <visua> grafi shut your whore mouth!
[20:44:12] <peepsalot> there isn't some way to just do it inside the events?  like preventdefault?
[20:44:30] <grafi> peepsalot prefixes are important afaik
[20:45:21] <doug65536> peepsalot: you want to do it with events when it's a 1-liner to do .css('user-select', 'none') with no js/event overhead?
[20:45:23] <visua> *.noselect{ .. }
[20:45:24] <grafi> visua :O
[20:45:25] <visua> hows that guys
[20:45:34] <grafi> getting colder
[20:45:35] <grafi> xD

[21:04:34] <boomshaka> anyone know how to update the helper position while dragging with jquery ui sortable widget ? the size of the dragged elements changes during drag, causing offsets to get messed up :(
[21:04:35] <doug65536> :)
[21:05:23] <grafi> boop
[21:05:31] <grafi> man its early
[21:05:36] <grafi> i should sleep
[21:05:38] <grafi> but i cant
[21:06:01] <grafi> everytime i close my eyes i see twerking raptors :D
[21:06:26] <boomshaka> (or a way to update the datas that the plugin caches, i even tried to dynamically set the "cursorAt" option, but still didn't get it working)
[21:08:51] <visua> grafi what time is it
[21:08:54] <visua> where you are
[21:09:02] <grafi> 6am
[21:09:05] <doug65536> boomshaka: dragging makes the size change? or it is being sized by something while it is dragged?
[21:09:45] <visua> dang
[21:10:25] <boomshaka> size changes because i change it to adapt it to the width of the container which is under the dragged item
[21:11:01] <boomshaka> actually it's a drag'n'drop page layout tool
[21:11:22] <boomshaka> you can move your "modules" from a column to another
[21:11:48] <boomshaka> then, ondrag, i adapt the "module" width to fit the column under
[21:12:34] <boomshaka> the problem is, it works very well if  set "cursorAt" to small values
[21:14:06] <boomshaka> if i don't use cursorAt, and let's say you begin to drag a module that's in a large column, and the grabbing point of your mouse is on the left. When i hover a narrower column, the mouse pointer gets out of the helper bounds. pretty hard to explain actually :/
[21:15:07] <grafi> im going to bed, good night my little blueberries
[21:15:16] <doug65536> boomshaka: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/7hS3v/
[21:16:25] <boomshaka> yes, but try to catch it at the bottom right corner when it's at the biggest size
[21:16:58] <doug65536> boomshaka: it works - in chrome anyway
[21:17:03] <doug65536> boomshaka: which browser
[21:17:12] <boomshaka> yes your example works
[21:17:19] <boomshaka> that's the behavior i get
[21:17:44] <boomshaka> but try to catch it at the bottom right corner when it's at the biggest size and move it
[21:18:24] <boomshaka> i'd like to adapt the grab point so that it says inside the dragged div
[21:18:26] <doug65536> ok, my mouse becomes "outside it" sure... you want it to pin to that actual distance from the corner?
[21:19:01] <boomshaka> yes that's it, actually i want to "pin" the ratio
[21:19:16] <doug65536> hmm, I think I know a workaround...
[21:19:38] <boomshaka> that's the hard point, you can't "pin" the position like cursorAt, because it will sooner or later get wrong
[21:20:02] <boomshaka> i manage to calculate wher the pointer should be, the problem is to apply it
[21:20:07] <boomshaka> while dragging :/
[21:20:21] <doug65536> boomshaka: do you insist on using jquery-ui for the dragging?
[21:21:04] <doug65536> boomshaka: you could setup a fast polling interval and "manually" do it pretty easily
[21:21:13] <boomshaka> i'll hack if the solution works ;) but yes i need jquery, everything's built upon it ^^
[21:22:20] <boomshaka> actually the real problem is to "refresh" the sortable (or draggable) widget cache on drag
[21:22:37] <doug65536> no, you're making it an XY problem
[21:22:55] <doug65536> your problem is "I want it to feel realistic" not "I want to hack into jquery-ui"
[21:23:10] <boomshaka> exactlyâ€¦ ^^
[21:23:24] <boomshaka> i want it to feel "like it should feel" :D
[21:25:22] <boomshaka> still, sadly i think i'll have to hack into jquery ui, else how could i override the widget's coordinates management ?
[21:25:56] <doug65536> boomshaka: I'm making a mini-plugin. we'll see how well it works out...
[21:26:48] <boomshaka> nice :) doing a fiddle so that you can see the exact context
[21:40:07] <visua> uh..why did I never use haml in the past
[21:40:08] <visua> this is rad
[21:41:24] <boomshaka> doug65536 : http://jsfiddle.net/94vPZ/14/ here you can see the problem. catch an item of the right column on its right part and drag it to the left column
[21:41:49] <boomshaka> you see the pointer get's 'off' the dragged element.
[21:42:18] <boomshaka> it's normal, of course, because the cursor offset is cached by the jqueryui widget, but i want to override this
[21:44:43] <boomshaka> good to precise i use tolerance:'pointer', so modifying the dragged element's position while dragging shouldn't be a problem
[21:51:19] <doug65536> boomshaka: way more complicated that I first thought but I think I almost have it
[21:52:58] <boomshaka> that'd be great :) and yes it's a bit complicated ^^ (everything works perfectly without this, but it would be so more cool if it behave "natural" :) )
[21:55:46] <boomshaka> here's the "complete" context : http://jsfiddle.net/94vPZ/27/
[22:05:29] <doug65536> boomshaka: I think cursorAt is the trick...
[22:05:49] <visua> dafuq
[22:06:10] <visua> Trying to get a gutterless grid going..doesn't work >:{
[22:06:19] <sammich> anyone thinking of getting the CODE keyboard?
[22:07:02] <doug65536> sammich: ew. I hate rectangular keyboards
[22:07:28] <doug65536> sammich: and mechanical keyboards are very loud and kind of annoying
[22:07:29] * sammich tries to imagine what a square keyboard is
[22:07:41] <doug65536> not ergonomic
[22:07:48] <boomshaka> omg no ^^ my hands love apple keyboards flatness so much !
[22:07:59] <sammich> boomshaka: me too, mate, me too
[22:08:02] <doug65536> I just puked in my mouth
[22:08:23] * sammich gives doug65536 some water to rinse his mouth out
[22:08:36] <boomshaka> ^^
[22:08:43] * doug65536 thanks sammich
[22:15:23] <boomshaka> doug65536 : i still don't manage to change cursorAt dynamically :(
[22:15:45] <doug65536> well, I sort of did... I'm trying another way though
[22:23:32] <boomshaka> ok, see, the cursorAt left position IS updated, but the display doesn't reflect it :( : http://jsfiddle.net/94vPZ/38/
[22:24:56] <sammich> ever a good idea to append a script in an IIFE?
[22:25:35] <doug65536> sammich: I don't see how it makes any difference
[22:25:45] <sammich> yeah, that's all I wanted to know
[22:27:02] <doug65536> boomshaka: this shows that you can get the coordinates that it wants to use then override them http://jsfiddle.net/94vPZ/42/
[22:31:18] <doug65536> boomshaka: so I think the trick is, on start, calculate the fractional offset (where 0,0 is the top left corner of the item, and 1,1 is the bottom right corner of the item), then, in the 'over' event, get ui.offset, get the width and height, compute the offset, subtract some fraction of its width and height, and set ui.helper.css( computedPosition )
[22:32:02] <doug65536> I'm falling asleep though
[22:32:22] <boomshaka> mmm, i love that passing datas through helper's attribute :) elegant way to deal with connected sortables problems
[22:32:49] <boomshaka> many thanks, that's enough for me to get it working, i think it can do the trick
[22:33:20] <boomshaka> though i'd be glad to give you the final script when it'll work !
[22:34:27] <doug65536> maybe someone should file a bug with jq-ui about it. it does seem pretty unintuitive to have the offset messed up like that when the helper changes size
[22:35:07] <boomshaka> indead
[22:35:16] <doug65536> although they may laugh, considering all the trickery it is doing to show the insertion point etc. :)
[22:35:33] <doug65536> "not good enough for you? BE GONE! GUARDS!"
[22:35:37] <boomshaka> :D
[22:39:51] <beardtree> Hi guys, I'm getting a weird error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'contains' of null" on load... any thoughts? http://beardtree.com:1337/
[22:49:33] <Cork> beardtree: looks like cloneTemplate does something wacky and creates something that breaks jquery's logic
[22:49:54] <beardtree> Cork: what makes you think so?
[22:50:05] <Cork> beardtree: backtracking the error
[22:50:25] <Cork> it gets an HTMLElement without a documentElement
[22:50:37] <beardtree> Cork: oh, interesting
[22:50:45] <Cork> and the htmlelement comes from ownDocument
[22:50:54] <Cork> so you have an ownDocument without a documentElement
[22:50:59] <Cork> and that makes no sense
[22:50:59] <beardtree> Cork: well I'm trying to use <template>
[22:51:45] <Cork> beardtree: if you comment out line 35 in app.js
[22:51:52] <Cork> does the error go away?
[22:52:10] <beardtree> Cork: indeed
[22:52:31] <Cork> and if you uncomment it again and comment .hole()?
[22:52:53] <beardtree> Cork: yes
[22:53:03] <Cork> so the problem is with $.fn.hole
[22:53:18] <beardtree> Well clearly
[22:53:22] <beardtree> The error is line 19
[22:54:04] <stroodlepup> hello?
[22:55:12] <Cork> beardtree: ah, you do find on a textnode
[22:55:37] <beardtree> Cork: $hole should not be a textnode?
[22:55:52] <Cork> not sure what it does, but no i don't think so
[22:56:47] <Cork> hmm i need to boot up firebug
[22:56:52] <Cork> one min
[22:57:18] <stroodlepup> I'm trying to bind a click event to buttons inside a table cell. what selector can I use?
[22:58:09] <beardtree> stroodlepup: $(document).on('click', 'td button', cb)
[22:58:42] <stroodlepup> beardtree, do you use coffeescript?
[22:58:49] <stroodlepup> thanks :)
[22:58:59] <beardtree> stroodlepup: I have but I do not
[22:59:29] <stroodlepup> what is cb?
[22:59:40] <stroodlepup> wait, dumb question :)
[23:04:40] <Cork> stroodlepup: CallBack
[23:04:54] <Cork> stroodlepup: add your callback function there
[23:05:21] <Cork> though i would prob go with binding the click handle on the table instead
[23:05:30] <beardtree> Yes
[23:05:47] <Cork> $('#table_id').on('click', 'button', function() {})
[23:07:01] <stroodlepup> Cork, i have 2 buttons in my table cell
[23:07:15] <Cork> stroodlepup: ok?
[23:09:29] <stroodlepup> kinda like this :)
[23:09:31] <stroodlepup> http://picpaste.com/Screenshot_from_2013-09-08_14_08_01-3SaGD90x.png
[23:10:04] <beardtree> Cork: any thoughts?
[23:10:29] <Cork> beardtree: not sure what hole is meant to do, so not sure where it fails
[23:10:54] <beardtree> Cork: it's meant to create or update a clone of #hole-template
[23:10:56] <Cork> stroodlepup: not sure how that matters here
[23:11:12] <stroodlepup> Cork, what do you mean?
[23:11:55] <Cork> stroodlepup: you give too little information to see anytning wrong with the callback you've been given
[23:12:08] <Cork> stroodlepup: take the table structure and put it on jsfiddle.net
[23:12:14] <Cork> and explain what you want to do
[23:13:29] <stroodlepup> i plan to create a auto generated table that has edit and delete functionality
[23:14:20] <Cork> beardtree: from what i ca tell it doesn't look likely that it expects text nodes as the outer most node
[23:14:51] <Cork> beardtree: cause if nothing else $(this).attr({'data-hole-id': hole.id}) makes absolutely no sense on a textnode
[23:15:26] <RRR2> told you
[23:15:50] <beardtree> I can confirm it's a textnode but have no idea why
[23:16:26] <Cork> beardtree: casue cloneTemplate returns textnode, textnode, div, textnode, textnode. div...
[23:16:47] <stroodlepup> Cork, I just need to know how to bind an event to a button inside a table
[23:17:29] <beardtree> Cork: yes, the issue is cloneTemplate -- what am I doing wrong?
[23:17:38] <Cork> beardtree: are you sure template is meant to be a <template> element?
[23:18:01] <Cork> that forces the page to be invalid
[23:18:10] <beardtree> <template> is valid HTML
[23:18:26] <Cork> no
[23:18:34] <stroodlepup> I tried using an attribute selector, but it does'nt  work
[23:18:40] <Cork> template isn't a standardized tag name
[23:19:02] <Cork> stroodlepup: do you even know the basics of jquery?
[23:19:05] <beardtree> Cork: http://www.w3.org/TR/html-templates/
[23:19:27] <Cork> uh...
[23:19:37] <Cork> from 6 months ago...
[23:20:04] <Cork> beardtree: and you're sure cloneTemplate expects a template element?
[23:20:14] <beardtree> That's what I wrote it for
[23:20:15] <Cork> normally those scripts expects a <script> tag
[23:20:30] <Cork> where the content doesn't get parsed
[23:21:03] <RRR2> cloneTemplate returns the textnode
[23:21:04] <Cork> ah, it's up there
[23:22:23] <Cork> beardtree: that contents() call doesn't look right to me
[23:22:45] <stroodlepup> Cork, yes and I tried td:button already
[23:22:54] <Cork> td:button?!?
[23:23:11] <Cork> stroodlepup: where would you use that?
[23:23:19] <beardtree> stroodlepup: td:button makes no sense
[23:23:27] <beardtree> stroodlepup: you want 'td button'
[23:23:38] <beardtree> Do *exactly* what Cork suggested
[23:23:40] <Cork> stroodlepup: you got the code to bind the event handlers
[23:23:53] <Cork> stroodlepup: what is the problem with that line?
[23:24:30] <stroodlepup> i was using $("td:button").click(cb);
[23:24:43] <beardtree> That makes. No sense.
[23:24:44] <Cork> beardtree: try replacing contents() with .children() in the cloneTemplate
[23:24:55] <Cork> it kinda makes sense
[23:24:58] <Cork> though it is wrong
[23:25:16] <beardtree> Cork: same thing :/
[23:25:18] <Cork> stroodlepup: $('tr button').click(cb) would work
[23:25:41] <beardtree> No it wouldn't, if you're dynamically populating the table
[23:25:43] <stroodlepup> I'm still a beginner at web design. I apologize :)
[23:25:46] <Cork> stroodlepup: though it would bind event lisners only to the element that exist in the page when you run it
[23:26:16] <Cork> stroodlepup: so, if you want the code to handle future created elements, you need to use event delegation
[23:26:29] <Cork> and that was the code we gave you
[23:26:58] <stroodlepup> $('#table_id').on('click', 'button', function() {}) this one?
[23:27:03] <Cork> yes
[23:27:10] <stroodlepup> thanks :)
[23:27:16] <Cork> where yu replace table_id with the id of the table
[23:27:24] <Cork> or class or what ever
[23:27:46] <Cork> but it should target the table, not the td or the button
[23:28:42] <boomshaka> doug65536 : if you're not asleep, many thanks :) : http://jsfiddle.net/5u2dD/
[23:29:01] <Cork> beardtree: btw template is dom4, and that is a *bit* early to implement :)
[23:29:12] <boomshaka> it works now, still needs some adjustement on drag out, but it's not a problem anymore, many many thanks :)
[23:29:19] <stroodlepup> DOM has versions too?
[23:29:23] <Cork> ya
[23:29:31] <Cork> 0,1,2,3,4
[23:29:40] <Cork> where 4 is in draft right now
[23:29:51] <stroodlepup> oh I see
[23:30:07] <Cork> 0 is legacy junk from before there was a standard body
[23:30:15] <Cork> like document.write
[23:30:26] <RRR2> lol
[23:30:27] <beardtree> Cork: what would you recommend?
[23:30:44] <Cork> beardtree: well to start with try replacing contents() with .children()
[23:30:57] <beardtree> Cork: same issue, but no text node
[23:31:07] <beardtree> (It's live)
[23:31:19] <RRR2> What does cloneTemplate is supposed to do
[23:31:24] <RRR2> just wondering
[23:31:40] <beardtree> Takes a <template> and clones the contents
[23:31:53] <beardtree> It's a polyfill kind of thing
[23:32:31] <RRR2> well it does that, I guess .append doesn't expect a textnode
[23:33:28] <Cork> beardtree: i just realized something
[23:33:34] <Cork> you arn't waiting for domready
[23:33:50] <beardtree> This is true
[23:34:01] <stroodlepup> Cork, so it is not possible to bind directly to a button when it is in a table?
[23:34:08] <Cork> so that could explain why you get the ownDocument not having a document element
[23:34:26] <Cork> stroodlepup: yes, but if you want to bind directly to the element
[23:34:32] <beardtree> Cork: nope, live again
[23:34:38] <RRR2> Maybe is a jQuery bug
[23:34:42] <Cork> stroodlepup: you would have to run the bind code every time you add a new one
[23:34:47] <Cork> RRR2: don't think so
[23:34:50] <stroodlepup> oh
[23:35:03] <stroodlepup> that would be awful
[23:35:16] <Cork> stroodlepup: so to not have to do taht
[23:35:20] <RRR2> The thing is jQuery checks what you want to append with a .firstChild or that's what I did saw, and since on a textnode it returns null it gets the error.
[23:35:23] <Cork> you bind on the closest static parent
[23:35:43] <Cork> RRR2: i don't think the textnode is the problem
[23:35:54] <Cork> especially as we removed it and still have the problem
[23:36:00] <RRR2> oh you do?
[23:36:11] <Cork> .contents() => .children()
[23:37:12] <Cork> but the only thing that makes sense is that the documentElement haven't been created yet
[23:37:22] <Cork> cause the parser is still parsing the original html
[23:37:44] <RRR2> I think he solved it
[23:37:51] <beardtree> Nope
[23:38:01] <RRR2> I don't see the null error anymore
[23:38:04] <RRR2> lawl
[23:38:10] <Cork> it's there
[23:38:32] <Cork> the jquery assumption makes sense
[23:38:52] <RRR2> I reloaded and console doesn't give me any errors
[23:38:53] <Cork> i really don't get why templet-child.ownDocument.documentElement is null
[23:39:44] <RRR2> documentElement is never null, right?
[23:39:45] <Cork> unless it is about template not being a valid html element (yet)
[23:39:52] <Cork> RRR2: shouldn't be at least
[23:40:02] <RRR2> body and head can be null
[23:40:02] <Cork> as long as there is a document for the node
[23:40:07] <Cork> and there should always be one
[23:40:37] <Cork> RRR2: don't think body can be null
[23:40:44] <Cork> after the document has been created that is
[23:40:53] <RRR2> body is null beforeload
[23:41:10] <Cork> ya, but we talk about after DOMContentLoaded now
[23:41:36] <RRR2> I was talking about documentElement never being null beforeload
[23:42:06] <Cork> well it might very well be
[23:42:12] <beardtree> Everything's in a domready handler now
[23:42:14] <RRR2> oh, it is.
[23:43:11] <RRR2> you would have to add an appendChild to document where you add the HTML tag or doctype
[23:43:17] <Cork> the problem is jquery does elm.ownDocument and later it does doc.nodeType == 9 (true)
[23:43:28] <LeBlaaanc> why does css('width') return the actual width value instead of a percentage?
[23:43:29] <Cork> so it runs doc.documentElement
[23:43:34] <Cork> and that fails cause it is null
[23:45:36] <Cork> LeBlaaanc: cause css returns the computed width of the element
[23:46:07] <Cork> LeBlaaanc: http://jsfiddle.net/fkr38/
[23:47:23] <LeBlaaanc> weird
[23:47:51] <Cork> not really
[23:47:54] <beardtree> Is there some workaround I can put in place for now?
[23:48:08] <Cork> beardtree: we are still looking for why this happens
[23:48:21] <LeBlaaanc> Cork: so, your example I assume only works for inline styles?
[23:48:30] <Cork> nope
[23:48:36] <beardtree> I mean, I have window.document available to me... Maybe I can monkeypatch it in?
[23:48:47] <Cork> move it to a rule on the left andsee
[23:49:57] <LeBlaaanc> Cork: well it does't return anything if it's in the css
[23:50:56] <Cork> uh
[23:51:20] <LeBlaaanc> oh you were probably answering beardtree
[23:51:34] <beardtree> ?
[23:51:36] <Cork> LeBlaaanc: halft of it was
[23:51:43] <Cork> *half
[23:51:54] <beardtree> Sorry, did I miss something?
[23:52:01] <LeBlaaanc> Cork: so can you get the percentage value from a css rule?
[23:52:06] <Cork> LeBlaaanc: not sure why elm.style.with is "" when it's from the css
[23:52:15] <Cork> my memory is failing me it seams
[23:52:38] <Cork> i rarely do these kind fetches
[23:52:43] <LeBlaaanc> that is probably just a wrapper for ele.style.width
[23:53:08] <Cork> $('div').prop('style') === $('div')[0].style
[23:53:19] <Cork> so no that isn't the problem
[23:53:30] <LeBlaaanc> ya that's the problem, it's not inline heh
[23:53:33] <Cork> .css uses .computatedStyles (i think that was the name)
[23:53:53] <Cork> LeBlaaanc: ya, but i thought .style wasn't only inline...
[23:54:01] <Cork> and that is where my memory is failing me :)
[23:54:21] <Cork> beardtree: no, not yet
[23:54:27] <LeBlaaanc> Cork:  well I dunno, we already lost our mind when .css('width') didn't return the width value for the css..
[23:54:45] <Cork> LeBlaaanc: no that is perfectly normal
[23:54:59] <LeBlaaanc> perfectly illogical.
[23:55:15] <Cork> no cause for the browser to draw the element
[23:55:21] <Cork> it needs the current size
[23:55:24] <cliffreich> hello
[23:55:29] <Cork> so computatedStyle will be the px value
[23:55:35] <LeBlaaanc> Cork: o.O but that's what width() is for
[23:56:30] <beardtree> LeBlaaanc: just put a class on the element with CSS width:xx% and check for the class
[23:57:59] <LeBlaaanc> I'm dynamically drawing an element based on another element soooo that's not going to work.
[23:58:44] <Cork> LeBlaaanc: best is most likely to hold the value outside the style system
[23:58:52] <Cork> like .data('width', width)
