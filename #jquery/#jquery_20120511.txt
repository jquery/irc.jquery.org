[00:33:02] <coldhead> ?g jquery swfobject plugin
[00:33:03] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery SWFObject Plugin - Sandbox - http://sandbox.thewikies.com/temp-swfobject/
[00:33:10] <coldhead> also check out the official theme song
[00:40:00] <asher^> anyone know how i can set the default error message with the jquery validator plugin? alternately, can i turn off the messages that appear next to each invalid item somehow?
[00:41:17] <coldhead> i can't remember the specifics but it's all in the docs, asher^
[00:41:25] <coldhead> you can handle the errors a bunch of different ways
[00:41:27] <asher^> ive been looking over them :-/
[00:41:36] <coldhead> ah
[00:41:44] <asher^> i can only see how to set messages for items with a particular name
[00:41:48] <asher^> not the default message
[00:50:31] <coldhead> did you try google, asher^ ?
[00:50:37] <coldhead> this is the first result i found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1373203/jquery-form-validate-how-to-setup-default-messages
[00:50:40] <coldhead> #relevant
[00:51:15] <asher^> oh, thanks
[00:57:25] <Jabberwocky> how can I use validation on an element that is not contained inside a form?
[00:59:00] <coldhead> Jabberwocky: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation#Validator
[00:59:06] <coldhead> there is something there about element()
[00:59:14] <coldhead> for validating single elements
[00:59:19] <coldhead> might need to check some demos as well
[00:59:32] <coldhead> the better solution is to put your form elements in a form :P
[01:01:17] <tga> what's a nice sane way of chaining async calls?
[01:01:41] <tga> I have a bunch of calls that depend on each other
[01:02:11] <coldhead> tga: this is still the gold standard http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[01:02:36] <tga> thanks
[01:02:39] * tga reads
[01:05:31] <Hippie_> $("object[type='application/x-shockwave-flash']").append('<param name="wMode" value="transparent"/>');
[01:05:33] <Hippie_> doesnt work
[01:05:46] <Hippie_> could anyone shed some light?
[01:07:24] <coldhead> the best fix for that is to use the jQuery swfobject plugin, as someone already recommended
[01:07:49] <coldhead> or you may prefer to keep smashing your head on the rock of struggle, at your option
[01:07:53] <coldhead> #matterforyoursel

[01:10:52] <Hippie_> thanks
[01:11:27] <vhsjon> hi guys, I have a .postJSON method (which I added myself to the jquery.js file, the same way the .getJSON is working) like this: http://pastie.org/3893828 But the callback doesn't fire, even though the web service does its job without any errors. Any ideas?
[01:12:23] <Hippie_> coldhead, the problem is that the flash is already on the page and I cant modify it so I need to append that text -_-
[01:13:02] <vhsjon> heres the code with the code for postJSON: http://pastie.org/3893828
[01:14:31] <coldhead> Hippie_: i'm not sure there's a "best" fix for it
[01:15:13] <coldhead> i've had to do stupid things like var x = $('#container').html(); x += '<somecrap>'; $('#container').html(x);
[01:15:20] <coldhead> flash and js is a painful business
[01:15:40] <coldhead> hej nicebot
[01:16:19] <atul_> hello all
[01:16:26] <atul_> is anyone around to answer
[01:16:31] <coldhead> ?ask @ atul_
[01:16:32] <bot-t> atul_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:16:41] <coldhead> let's get on with it! :D
[01:16:46] <atul_> sorry to take your time
[01:16:55] <atul_> I wanted to ask about data method
[01:17:07] <atul_> suppopse I have an element on the page
[01:17:13] <atul_> let's say a span
[01:17:16] <coldhead> sure
[01:17:20] <atul_> and I store data like
[01:17:36] <atul_> <span data-someData="value"></span>
[01:17:43] <atul_> then
[01:18:23] <atul_> I can access the calue using, $('span').data('somedata'), but not using $('span').data('someData')
[01:18:36] <atul_> notice the difference in 'case'
[01:18:43] <coldhead> i see it
[01:18:51] <coldhead> that's surprising
[01:18:59] <coldhead> atul_: have you read this? http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[01:19:11] <atul_> I guess no
[01:19:11] <coldhead> that has the best everything-you-need-to-know-ever
[01:19:16] <atul_> lemme check it out
[01:19:18] <coldhead> i am going to try to replicate your issue
[01:19:27] <atul_> thanks, coolhead
[01:19:46] <atul_> I was also wondering, if this issue is big enough to qualify for being reported
[01:20:01] <atul_> I can surely use toLowerCase() method, but so can jQuery API
[01:20:11] <atul_> why pollute my code
[01:20:37] <atul_> one morething I would like to report
[01:21:24] <coldhead> atul_: http://jsfiddle.net/ku3A3/
[01:21:28] <coldhead> you're quite right
[01:21:30] <coldhead> it flattens case
[01:21:40] <coldhead> i would assume that's by design, so it's not technically a bug
[01:21:42] <atul_> on thios page "http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/", at the bottom of the main content there's a link like "irc.freenode.net"
[01:21:53] <atul_> the link it too hard to get working
[01:21:57] <atul_> after trying a lot
[01:22:02] <human_bot> hi coldhead
[01:22:20] <atul_> I ended in some chat room where there were only about 10 people and everyone was away
[01:22:55] <coldhead> atul_: i suspect the case folding is in a spec
[01:23:06] <coldhead> so it's probably The Right Behaviour
[01:23:07] <atul_> coolhead, would it be wrong to ask to add the casing thing in jQuery itself
[01:23:11] <coldhead> the browser probably upcases everything
[01:23:12] <atul_> so users don't have to mess with it
[01:23:30] <coldhead> atul_: if you want to try #jQuery-dev
[01:23:34] <coldhead> they will no more
[01:23:41] <coldhead> but i bet they are all asleep
[01:23:47] <atul_> :)
[01:24:07] <atul_> lemme give it a try
[01:24:09] <coldhead> atul_: why don't you just lowercase the attr in your html
[01:24:18] <coldhead> then the code will be the same
[01:24:20] <coldhead> and all is well
[01:25:00] <atul_> I can ofcourse do that
[01:25:13] <atul_> but camel case makes it a lot easier to read stuff
[01:25:23] <atul_> make my code more clean
[01:25:46] <atul_> I would rather start using underscore seperated names then all lower case
[01:26:02] <atul_> however, I believe, this can be added in the j
[01:26:03] <atul_> Query
[01:26:57] <coldhead> atul_: but it may be that you're not supposed to have camelcase in your attrs
[01:27:06] <coldhead> in which case all lowercase is "the right thing"
[01:27:12] <vhsjon> hi guys, I have a .postJSON method (which I added myself to the jquery.js file, the same way the .getJSON is working) like this: http://pastie.org/3893828 But the callback doesn't fire, even though the web service does its job without any errors, and the returned object from the web service is a valid JSON object. Any ideas?
[01:27:13] <atul_> you got a point there :)
[01:27:30] <atul_> browsers do mess with casing
[01:27:41] <coldhead> atul_: that's what i was thinking, jquery may not even see your nice casing
[01:27:50] <coldhead> it might get the attrs in lowercase
[01:27:50] <atul_> I should better try '-' or '_' seperation
[01:28:00] <coldhead> - is very common
[01:28:06] <atul_> yes
[01:28:07] <coldhead> that's what i use
[01:28:17] <atul_> jQuery class names also use '-'
[01:28:18] <coldhead> thanks for bringing this up anyway atul_, it's been interesting
[01:28:34] <atul_> thanks coldhead
[01:28:46] <atul_> I think I got the solution :)
[01:28:51] <atul_> by the way
[01:29:03] <atul_> coolhead is a lot easiser to type then coldhead ;)
[01:30:11] <Clorith> I'm wanting to loop through the ancestors of a menu <ul>, and ensure the parent/ancestor/etc elements get the same class as the current active menu element. I know I'll need ot loop them with .each() but I'm uncertain of how to tell it that I wan to do "each parent", could someone give me a point in the right direction of the function I need?
[01:30:14] <coldhead> yes i don't mind
[01:30:39] <coldhead> Clorith: are you SURE that's what you need?
[01:30:48] <coldhead> if an element's parent has a particular class
[01:31:00] <coldhead> you can use CSS to do The Right Thing for the children automatically
[01:31:06] <Clorith> The parents don't have the class, that's the problem, but they -should- have it =/
[01:31:19] <coldhead> like ul.parent-class li {border: 1px solid #fff}
[01:31:20] <Clorith> The child has the class though, but the parent needs it as well
[01:31:22] <coldhead> oh right
[01:31:25] <coldhead> that's shit
[01:31:31] <Clorith> yup
[01:32:00] <atul_> if I may ask, what do you need class for
[01:32:03] <coldhead> okay so if i know that certain <a>s have class aids and i want to give the LI the same
[01:32:07] <atul_> onm all the ancestors
[01:32:16] <Clorith> menu displaying child elements depening on what page you are on
[01:32:18] <atul_> way up to the body element
[01:32:24] <coldhead> i would use $('a.aids').closest('li').addClass('aids')
[01:32:25] <Clorith> but it's not the primary menu of the site
[01:33:00] <atul_> just one question
[01:33:12] <atul_> do you want the class on the immediate parent
[01:33:16] <atul_> or all the ancestors?
[01:33:30] <Clorith> all the ancestors
[01:33:46] <atul_> until you reach 'body' element
[01:33:48] <atul_> ?
[01:33:49] <Clorith> If it was just the immediate I knew I could jsut use .closest()
[01:34:09] <Clorith> until I reach a specific ID ideally
[01:34:32] <atul_> assuming you know what you're upto, use the ancestors method, that will give you and array of all the ancestors, then use each() to iterate over them and then use the addClass method
[01:34:43] <Clorith> wow, there's a .parentsUntil()
[01:34:53] <atul_> the names might be wrong a bit but search API doc will give you the right names of these functions
[01:34:57] <leipie> hello, I have question about the .on event selector: When I give it "keypress blur" and press tab from the element, firefox and opera the event has type keypress while in chrome it reports focusout. The same problem occurs with selector "submit blur" and pressing enter in a form field. Why this different and unexpected behaviour in chrome
[01:35:42] <Clorith> Yeah, turns out .parentsUntil() does exactly what I want =)
[01:36:13] <atul_> that 'on' question reminds me, is it the new version on 'live' method
[01:36:25] <wltoriginal> Hi all. My <a> tag is styled to look like a button by jquery ui, but my pointer changes into a cursor on hover. How do I style the cursor back into a pointer so it looks as if my <a> tag is actually a button?
[01:36:42] <atul_> I use live to add observers to specific selectrs, so that they apply to even those elements which I add dynamically
[01:37:11] <coldhead> atul_: on() is the new live()
[01:37:12] <coldhead> ?on
[01:37:12] <atul_> but last time I tried 'on', it didn't work for the dynamically added elements
[01:37:13] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:37:23] <coldhead> it DOES work, but the syntax is trickier
[01:37:25] <coldhead> read the docs
[01:37:33] <coldhead> there are caveats for using it like live()
[01:37:40] <atul_> ok, I will give it a try once more
[01:37:51] <atul_> right now all my code uses the depricated 'live'
[01:38:04] <coldhead> wltoriginal: .someclass {cursor: pointer} ?
[01:38:12] <coldhead> or cursor: intial;
[01:38:13] <atul_> can you give more pointer coldhead
[01:38:27] <atul_> a keywork or something that I should be looking for
[01:38:58] <coldhead> atul_: read the bit starting with Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to .on()
[01:39:03] <coldhead> also all the other bits :)
[01:39:08] <coldhead> and then trial and error
[01:39:26] <atul_> ok
[01:39:28] <atul_> thanks
[01:39:37] <atul_> one more, if I may
[01:39:54] <atul_> how to detect if the img tag hasn't loaded well
[01:39:59] <coldhead> we gotta get on() working becuase it's the future
[01:40:06] <atul_> I mean the image at src don't exist
[01:40:26] <wltoriginal> coldhead: thanks a lot for the help! :)
[01:40:32] <atul_> I used the event 'error' successfully
[01:40:36] <coldhead> atul_: when i really care about an image i use new Image() and assign a src and poll for loaded
[01:40:39] <atul_> but it fails with the live method
[01:40:50] <xec|work> atul_: you are probably most interested in the part about delegates
[01:40:59] <coldhead> jQuery has no special tricks to help you with images
[01:41:09] <atul_> oh
[01:41:11] * coldhead kicks jQuery
[01:41:42] <atul_> I wnated to make sure that all images exist, and if somehow they don't then load a default image, something that sayd 'photo not available'
[01:41:44] <atul_> says*
[01:42:13] <atul_> didn't get you xec|work_
[01:43:08] <xec|work> atul_: in the documentation for .on()
[01:43:31] <atul_> lemme check
[01:43:36] <atul_> now I get it
[01:43:43] <xec|work> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[01:43:48] <atul_> I thought you were talking about the image thing
[01:45:59] <atul_> "Or, use delegated events to attach an event handler, as described next.", this should have a solution for me
[01:46:09] <Berl> Hi, somebody suggest whats the best jquery plugin for twitter like @mention
[01:46:14] <leipie> hello, I have question about the .on event selector: When I give it "keypress blur" and press tab from the element, firefox and opera the event has type keypress while in chrome it reports focusout. The same problem occurs with selector "submit blur" and pressing enter in a form field. Why this different and unexpected behaviour in chrome
[01:46:18] <atul_> thanks xec|work
[01:46:22] <atul_> thanks coldhead
[01:46:37] <atul_> I appreciate what you people do here :)
[01:49:27] <atul_> Berl, use bootstrap for twitter like stuff, http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
[01:49:50] <liam__> hi I am trying to clone a table row with inputs when clicking a link but it is not working. here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/VBeEN/1/ any ideas?
[01:50:28] <coldhead> thanks atul_ !
[01:50:37] <xec|work> thanks atul_ !
[01:52:31] <xec|work> Berl: what do you mean by "twitter like @mention" - the autosuggestion?
[01:53:12] <xec|work> leipie: could you make a small demo?
[01:53:23] <Berl> xec|work, just like twitter, yeah autosuggestion
[01:53:41] <xec|work> i don't use twitter you see, but i think i might know what you mean
[01:55:11] <xec|work> if you're using a simple text input there are plenty of decent plugins, just google a bit. but if you need a multiline textarea or text editor/contenteditable i have been looking myself and not found anything
[01:56:10] <xec|work> so i am in the process of making my own... something i do NOT recommend!
[01:56:12] <sviatovigt> I have an html element stored inside a variable
[01:56:22] <sviatovigt> how can I get its value?
[01:56:37] <xec|work> sviatovigt: value? of the variable?
[01:58:57] <bittyx-work> hi all. i have an object with some default regionalized options for the datepicker plugin. ie. local_datepicker = { dayNames : [ ... ], monthNames : [ ... ], ... };
[01:59:29] <liam__> any ideas on how to clone a table row with inputs, assign new IDs and append it to the table? I have made an attempt here but it doesn't respond... http://jsfiddle.net/VBeEN/1/
[01:59:50] <bittyx-work> when i initialize the datepicker, i am currently doing $(...).datepicker( { dayNames : local_datepicker.dayNames, monthNames : local_datepicker.monthNames, ... } );
[02:00:00] <bittyx-work> along with the other (non-regional specific) options after those
[02:00:22] <bittyx-work> is there some quicker/elegant way to just import the whole local_datepicker object into the datepicker options while initializing?
[02:00:53] <bittyx-work> (of course, while, at the same time being able to set other options not related to regionalization)

[02:04:03] <sviatovigt> ?
[02:04:23] <DarsVaeda> is anyone by any chance familiar with jtemplates?
[02:04:57] <sviatovigt> xec | work: I don't understand your question
[02:05:02] <xec|work> sviatovigt: a demo demonstrates an issue, what am i looking at, what do i do/click, and what do you expect to happen
[02:06:00] <sviatovigt> <input type="checkbox" name="company-id" id="company-id" value="96">
[02:06:09] <sviatovigt> this is an input type checkbox
[02:06:22] <sviatovigt> I want to get the value="96"
[02:06:34] <sviatovigt> in ids_array
[02:07:01] <sviatovigt> element, in each, stores <input type="checkbox" name="company-id" id="company-id" value="96">
[02:07:18] <sviatovigt> but if I run element.val() ends up in an error
[02:07:46] <xec|work> sviatovigt: try element.value
[02:08:19] <xec|work> sviatovigt: if you want to use jquery methods you need to make it a jquery object first, like $(element).val()
[02:08:42] <xec|work> ?anyone @ DarsVaeda
[02:08:42] <bot-t> DarsVaeda, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[02:09:11] <DarsVaeda> xec: did not ask directly cause I thought it is offtopic
[02:10:16] <DarsVaeda> I actually need to know how to nest attributes like: "{$T.[$T.id].something}"
[02:10:58] <xec|work> maybe remove the dot after the first $T?
[02:11:14] <xec|work> im just guessing wildly of course
[02:11:23] <stygyan> hello
[02:11:41] <DarsVaeda> uhm yeah that was a typo there is no dot of course
[02:11:43] <stygyan> i just ran into a problem with selectors. or more adequately, a complete lack of understanding of them.
[02:12:43] <stygyan> i've got a bunch of links that link to several titles on the same page. those titles, if you click on them, will expand to show the content. i want the links to do exactly the same.
[02:12:47] <stygyan> but i don't really know how to.
[02:13:00] <stygyan> how to target them exactly, and only once.

[02:29:48] <DashCC> is jquery animate hardware accelerated?
[02:36:03] <Hippie_> DashCC, I can't see how else
[02:36:25] <DashCC> well, the opposite of hardware accelerated is not hardware accelerated :-)
[02:36:40] <Hippie_> Does anyone know if I can disable script in a certain block on the page using script?
[02:36:58] <EdwardIII> if your machine runs 2d hardware acceleration isn't pretty much everything on-screen hardware accelerated?
[02:37:18] <DashCC> no, there are just certain tasks really hardware accelerated
[02:37:28] <DashCC> css3 animations, 3D WebGL Animations and such
[02:39:43] <DashCC> EdwardIII: hardware accelerated usually means that certain rendering tasks are not only done by the CPU but the GPU
[02:44:05] <Hippie_> DashCC, I don't think they are done by GPU
[02:44:18] <DashCC> Where else?
[02:44:20] <quicksilver> whethere they use the GPU or not is entirely out of jquery's hands
[02:44:28] <quicksilver> jquery animate is just standard DOM calls
[02:44:43] <quicksilver> certain browsers on certain OSes will use hardware for some kinds of DOM change
[02:44:47] <quicksilver> but that's a browser/OS thing
[02:45:08] <DashCC> well. I now know that animate() is not accelerated however there is a cool plugin which enables it
[02:45:12] <DashCC> http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[02:45:15] <DashCC> for anyone interested
[02:45:54] <quicksilver> that's not quite a correct summary, DashCC
[02:45:54] <Hippie_> Yeah I was just reading that :)
[02:46:03] <quicksilver> neither animate nor animate enhanced is hardware accelerated
[02:46:21] <quicksilver> however, more browser/OS combinations will manage to use hardware acceleration for CSS3 transitions
[02:46:30] <quicksilver> so a CSS3 backend for animate helps.
[02:46:37] <Hippie_> quicksilver, CSS3 uses hardware accelrated
[02:47:05] <Hippie_> yeah
[02:47:19] <Hippie_> the plugin he showed uses CSS3
[02:47:55] <quicksilver> yes.
[02:48:28] <Cork> uh... js is hw accelerated just like css3
[02:48:40] <Cork> the difference is if you do more work then needed
[02:48:59] <Cork> requestAnimationFrame makes js just as fast as css
[02:49:55] <Cork> 1.6 used requestAnimationFrame, but cause of many users doing animation wrong it was backed out
[02:50:15] <EdwardIII> how were users doing animation wrong?
[02:50:29] <Cork> they expect animations to be constant
[02:50:40] <Cork> so they have a setInterval that queues animation
[02:50:53] <Cork> and then expect them to run async and "it works"
[02:51:12] <Cork> animationFrame doesn't animate an element unless its visible
[02:51:20] <Cork> ex. if you move to another tab
[02:51:32] <EdwardIII> i see
[02:51:36] <Cork> so when they move back they get a rush of animation (the long long queue)
[03:09:19] <sviatovigt> how can I transform an array in a json string
[03:12:54] <Hippie_> http://cheezburger.com/6215904512
[03:13:32] <sgfgdf> hello, guys! i have an image (which is "position: absolute") that if it is bigger than the browser window i want to make it scrollable by moving the mouse to the edges. i made this event -- $(document).bind('mousemove',function(e){  }); and i can probably use $(document).scrollTop(); $(document).scrollLeft(); to move, but i'm not sure how calc the values for scrollTop and scrollLeft().
[03:16:32] <Hippie_> sgfgdf, correct me if im wrong but if you have a div ontop #top then you could use scrollTop($('#top'), '2000')
[03:16:33] <Hippie_> ?
[03:23:59] <sgfgdf> Hippie_, i think scrollTop() accepts only one parameter.
[03:24:13] <stygyan> mh. weird. it seems i can't select jquery generated classes.
[03:24:17] <stygyan> should i be able to?
[03:25:02] <Hippie_> sgfgdf, 2 .. where it needs to go and how long it should take, and a callback
[03:25:21] <Hippie_> sgfgdf, whoops sorry
[03:25:35] <sgfgdf> Hippie_, my idea is if i have very big image so it can't fit on the screen i make it position: absolute and then when i move the mouse to the corners i want to scroll and be able to see the whole image.
[03:26:57] <sgfgdf> Hippie_, i'm not sure probably i have to calculate some proportion between the screen size and the size of the image and then when move to use that proportion.
[03:27:29] <Hippie_> I will play around soonish and let you know
[03:28:10] <sgfgdf> Hippie_, so if my mouse is at the middle of the screen by X and Y it should show the image at the middle.
[03:28:41] <sgfgdf> Hippie_, i can provide you some kind of working example, but not exactly, wait.
[03:31:56] <sgfgdf> Hippie_, can i pm you?
[03:32:00] <Hippie_> sure
[03:37:15] <SURFkees> How can I add HTML to a node when that html includes an <a> tag? It seems it removes the content of the <a> tag which disables the link.
[03:37:21] <SURFkees> how can I get around that?
[03:38:02] <Cork> SURFkees: sounds like your html is invalid
[03:41:18] <SURFkees> Cork, this is the HTML I receive: test test2 test3 <a href=http://www.google.nl/>test4</a>
[03:41:51] <SURFkees> After it's added via the .html() function it looks like this: test test2 test3 <a href="http://www.google.nl"></a>test4
[03:44:24] <xec|work> SURFkees: quote the href value
[03:48:13] <SURFkees> xec, ok, will try
[04:01:39] <Bahaman> Hi, how can I change the starting day from sunday to monday in the datepicker? (Im new to jquery)
[04:04:41] <nebmo88> hi, I have a form with multiple textboxes. how to i make it that when i click on a textbox, it will put the value of the selected row in a listbox?
[04:05:21] <quicksilver> what's a listbox?
[04:16:27] <poppiez> I'm creating a build script that concatenates and minifies my javascript. there's a lot of /*! */ comments in some of the plugins that doesn't get minified. is it "allowed" to remove the comments to reduce the file size?
[04:17:55] <Cork> poppiez: those are normally license comments
[04:18:00] <poppiez> they are
[04:18:09] <Jagan> h i
[04:18:10] <Cork> and for copyright to be valid no its not
[04:18:48] <Jagan> how to give close button outside rigth corner of jquery dialog box
[04:19:10] <poppiez> Cork: true but I might be able to place the copyright somewhere else on my site and not in the code itself
[04:19:33] <Cork> poppiez: as you generate one file, as long as you have it once at the top it should be ok
[04:19:35] <Mr_DeLeTeD> Hi, i need a piece of help with the $.ajax()
[04:19:50] <poppiez> Cork: great - thx! :)
[04:19:51] <Cork> poppiez: but no the copyright needs to be in the file
[04:22:03] <sviatovigt> how can I transform an array into a json string?
[04:22:54] <Cork> JSON.stringify
[04:23:07] <Cork> or arr.join(',')
[04:23:29] <Cork> oh wait you said json, so not the last
[04:23:32] <sviatovigt> thank you
[04:24:15] <johnline3> i am defining where a slideshow script should look for the thumbnail images with this:
[04:24:15] <johnline3> thumb:$(img).attr('../' + 'src'),
[04:24:50] <johnline3> not sure if this is the correct way.. will this prepend ../ the the beginning of the url?
[04:28:16] <Mr_DeLeTeD> Someone can help me about $.ajax() ?
[04:28:30] <Cork> ?ask @ Mr_DeLeTeD
[04:28:31] <bot-t> Mr_DeLeTeD, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:29:49] <poppiez> Cork: btw, reason I'm asking is because my JS is 288 KB when minified. I think that's a bit too much. what do you think?
[04:29:53] <Mr_DeLeTeD> How is it possible to process an $.ajax method on a $.ajax method (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10548167/progress-bar-in-php-jquery/10548304)
[04:30:30] <poppiez> using libs like jquery, backbone, underscore, json2, iscroll etc.
[04:30:50] <Cork> poppiez: it kinda depends
[04:30:59] <Cork> you want to keep it in chunk sizes
[04:31:21] <Cork> cause when you go over the size of a tcp package you get the extra roundtrip cost
[04:31:41] <Cork> so saving 10 bytes doens't always matter
[04:32:01] <Cork> just if they are the 10 bytes that cause an extra package :)
[04:32:12] <poppiez> so each package is 10 bytes?
[04:32:18] <Cork> lol no
[04:32:25] <Cork> it depends on the hardware
[04:32:27] <quicksilver> if your JS is 288KB I very much doubt that copyright statements make much relative difference.
[04:32:35] <quicksilver> gzip compression would be more important
[04:32:36] <Cork> but i think the normal size is about 1.5k
[04:32:43] <quicksilver> (and copyright statements gzip well, as a rule)
[04:32:56] <Mr_DeLeTeD> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10549668/process-an-ajax-function-while-an-ajax-function => This link is better : / soz
[04:33:00] <Cork> ya, gziping is a good solution
[04:34:07] <Cork> Mr_DeLeTeD: don't really get your question
[04:34:22] <Cork> Mr_DeLeTeD: if you want to trigger another event do another call
[04:34:29] <poppiez> quicksilver: cork: thx, will try out gzipping :)
[04:34:44] <Cork> poppiez: it adds a bit on the server load
[04:34:58] <Cork> but if you have a good frontend server it should work well
[04:35:01] <poppiez> Cork: but I can gzip the files in my build script
[04:35:10] <Cork> sure
[04:35:17] <Cork> as long as you conf your server correctly
[04:35:17] <poppiez> wouldn't that take the overhead?
[04:35:24] <Cork> yes it would
[04:35:28] <Mr_DeLeTeD> @cork : i do 2 call (you have my code on the stackoverlfow link ) but the 2nd call is processed after the first, not while !
[04:35:33] <Cork> well the client side would still exist :)
[04:36:00] <quicksilver> gzip is such a trivial overhead for a modern frontend config
[04:36:10] <quicksilver> that I just do it dynamically
[04:36:23] <quicksilver> (and you need the ungzipped version for braindead client browsers configs, probably)
[04:36:49] <quicksilver> almost all the common frontend server software will dynamically gzip
[04:37:04] <Cork> Mr_DeLeTeD: it should be, not sure why it wouldn't, might be server related
[04:37:32] <Cork> ya, doing it dynamically has the pros of the server knowing if it can do it
[04:37:36] <Cork> and it can adjust
[04:37:59] <fris> im using .change() any idea why it only shows the loading gif on the 2nd try? http://hotlinkers.com/archives/
[04:38:53] <Mr_DeLeTeD> @Cork : i don't realy understand your answer :s, it can't be solved on jQuery ?
[04:40:42] <danelu> can you guys help me ? how do i change this: if($.browser.msie) into if NOT msie ?
[04:41:01] <poppiez> Cork: gzipping sure does a lot. it's not 93 KB
[04:41:02] <Mr_DeLeTeD> if( !$.browser.msie)
[04:41:05] <Cork> Mr_DeLeTeD: what i mean is i can't see a reason why it should fail, that should work just fine as long as the server lets you process multiple connections
[04:41:06] <poppiez> it's now*
[04:41:27] <Cork> poppiez: ya, js has loads of repeated sections
[04:41:30] <Mr_DeLeTeD> @Cork, ok, i'll check that, thanks
[04:41:52] <Cork> Mr_DeLeTeD: never tried to do what your doing, but i can't see why it should fail
[04:41:55] <poppiez> Cork: that's awesome. thx a lot :) you too quicksilver
[04:42:00] <danelu> ok, that worked Mr_DeLeTeD, thanks :)
[04:42:22] <Cork> danelu: you should try to avoid those checks
[04:42:36] <Cork> danelu: if at all possible test the feature you need instead
[04:42:48] <Cork> (most of the time it is)
[05:00:24] <jac0bz1> H! to the ELLO!
[05:01:32] <jac0bz1> Anyone know why i get "INVALID_STATE_ERR: DOM Exception 11" with this code? >   var theVideo = $("#frame").children(); theVideo.play();
[05:02:00] <jac0bz1> <div id="frame"><video><source>...
[05:03:36] <LordMetroid> I added:
[05:03:37] <LordMetroid> $.get("product.php?id=269-028", function(data) { $(".result").html(data);
[05:04:06] <LordMetroid> But it doesn't seem to do anything. The html from product.php is not inserted into the body
[05:05:08] <jac0bz1> Have you checked what product.php returns?
[05:05:24] <jac0bz1> Check your console
[05:05:35] <jac0bz1> or run it directly
[05:06:00] <adam007> any one know plugin that lighbox imagw show image on the description ?
[05:06:52] <LordMetroid> YesI do a request for product.php and I do get the expected html
[05:07:03] <LordMetroid> But how do I add it to the page?
[05:07:06] <adam007> any one know plugin that lighbox imagw show image on the description ?
[05:08:23] <soee> hi, in regular expression can i force each word separate by space to be checked with some pattern ?
[05:11:23] <Mr_DeLeTeD> @Cork, i can't found what i can edit for let my server process multi connexion, got you an idea ?
[05:11:28] <yango> How can I make sure the browser does not catch a tab keypress?
[05:12:18] <yango> I want to have the tab keypress to move a box in a table, but keeping the focus on the selected cell, rather than on a link or the navigation bar
[05:12:54] <Jagan> i want to create close button at outside right corner ? can anyone help me?
[05:16:05] <LordMetroid> $(".result").html(data); Why do I have the ".result"?
[05:16:22] <yango> because you are selecting an element with class result
[05:17:14] <LordMetroid> but the html from the product.php is in contained in the variable data, right?
[05:18:45] <spets> I can't access data() values on the elements I've created with append()
[05:18:57] <spets> does anyone have an idea?
[05:19:50] <LordMetroid> 		$.get("product.php?id=269-028", function(data) {
[05:19:55] <LordMetroid> $(".result").html(data);
[05:20:16] <yango> LordMetroid: data will be the response of the php code, yes
[05:20:23] <yango> (if I remember correctly)
[05:20:40] <LordMetroid> So how do I add the data to the page?
[05:21:06] <spets> anybody know why $.data() does not work on created dom elements?
[05:21:07] <yango> by creating an element with class="result"
[05:21:27] <yango> $("#YourElementId").data() does not work, spets ?
[05:21:45] <yango> LordMetroid: for example <p class="result"></p>
[05:21:56] <spets> yango:  I am creating elements with append() and that element has a data-xxx value
[05:22:01] <LordMetroid> Can I not simply dump it where the script is executed?
[05:22:07] <yango> LordMetroid: no
[05:22:10] <spets> then I'm trying to access this value with data("xxx")
[05:22:15] <yango> you need an HTML element to place the result in
[05:22:43] <LordMetroid> ahaa
[05:22:46] <yango> spets: but what elements are you creating, do they have ids?
[05:23:09] <spets> yan: <tr> element of a table
[05:23:29] <spets> yango:  like: ..prepend('<tr data-id="15"><td>blala</td></tr>');
[05:23:46] <yango> spets: why are you inventing html attributes?
[05:23:54] <yango> use id="15"
[05:24:11] <yango> and then $("#15").data()
[05:24:15] <spets> I thought that it was not valid
[05:24:46] <yango> as long as ids are unique, it's valid
[05:25:23] <spets> what if I would like to stroe an email, or name ..
[05:25:33] <spets> would you offer name="John" ?
[05:25:38] <yango> you shouldn't
[05:25:56] <yango> use an id for the row, from wherever it makes sense
[05:27:07] <spets> sorry for that bad example with "id", but I am not having troubles with "id" s
[05:27:27] <spets> I am trying to store some values with the elements I created with append()
[05:27:35] <jonathancutrell> 02
[05:27:47] <spets> imagine that data: <tr city="Newyork"></tr>
[05:27:48] <jonathancutrell> Sorry about that...
[05:27:59] <spets> created with append()
[05:28:17] <spets> after that creation, I cant get that "city" data value
[05:28:23] <yango> spets: you can't invent HTML attributes
[05:28:26] <spets> sorry the example should be :  <tr data-city="Newyork"></tr>
[05:28:41] <yango> spets: or you can, but it won't work :)
[05:29:15] <yango> you can store that data as a javascript array
[05:29:19] <yango> and access it directly
[05:29:29] <yango> you can the associate that data with a row through an id
[05:29:34] <mda_> I'm trying to duplicate this demo in a simple phonegap(cordova) container: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/lists/lists-search.html
[05:30:01] <mda_> The stylesheet isn't getting applied to the list....here's my pastebin: http://pastebin.com/JwhQspub
[05:30:35] <yango> for example data = [{ id: 15, city: 'Newyork', population: 500000 },{id: 16, city: 'Rome', population: 4000000}]
[05:30:43] <yango> you can send that from your server via JSON
[05:30:44] <mda_> I commented-out the search bar part because I only care about the list at the moment BTW.
[05:30:55] <Mr_DeLeTeD> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10549668/process-an-ajax-function-while-an-ajax-function => Someone got the idea, i'm not realy sure the error come from my server
[05:31:13] <yango> and then you have <tr id="15"><td>This is New York</td></tr><tr id="16"><td>This is Rome!</td></tr>
[05:31:22] <stenno|work> uhm dumb question, i have an array [1,2,3,4], and i want to select, say, every odd number. i know .select from ruby arrays, so i tried it and it doesn't exist. what is the jquery equivalent for .select ?
[05:31:30] <mda_> whoops, wrong channel, sorry, i'll try #jquerymobile
[05:31:40] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks - quick question. This may be better for #javascript, but I'm looking to watch for a "upload complete" event from a regular form. I'm sending image data from a canvas to a server, and then delivering it as a downloadable file stream. What event can I watch for, if any, for that?
[05:32:14] <stenno|work> oh nevermind, found $.filter
[05:32:32] <yango> better data = { 15: { city: 'Newyork', population: 500000 }, 16: { city: 'Rome', population: 4000000}}
[05:32:44] <yango> and then you can use data[15] to get all the relevant info for the row
[05:32:56] <yango> or data[16]
[05:33:02] <yango> etc, etc.
[05:33:38] <Trisox> basic js ;)
[05:35:33] <yango> Trisox: JS001
[05:35:36] <DeltaHeavy> I have this really annoying bug. I have two divs, one with a selection of 4 buttons and the other one is filled with content filled with jQuery's .html(). The second menu slides in from the side using jQuery's .animate(). When going to the second menu, the first div's width is animated to 0, while the second menu's width is animated to it's proper width, and visa versa for the back button. When I go back, then click on a button before .animate() is fully co
[05:35:47] <Trisox> :-)
[05:36:14] <yango> but spets is inventing HTML attributes and wondering why jQuery doesn't work with them, so a JS001 is needed
[05:36:34] <yango> and maybe an HTML001 as well
[05:36:59] <Trisox> well you can.. invent attibutes ;)
[05:37:09] <Trisox> same goes for html tags
[05:37:12] <granden> The example for the accordion menu on jquery ui website
[05:37:15] <jonathancutrell> yango: There's nothing wrong with data-blah attributes.
[05:37:22] <jonathancutrell> yango: It's part of the html5 spec.
[05:37:33] <Trisox> but... then you have to do some fancy stuff
[05:37:33] <granden> one menu item always is open, could I modify it somehow to be able to have all closed if pressing the open one?
[05:37:37] <yango> so jQuery doesn't work with them yet?
[05:37:45] <Trisox> they do
[05:37:47] <Trisox> ;)
[05:37:57] <yango> then I need an HTML5-001 !
[05:38:06] <jonathancutrell> yango: $(el).data("blah")
[05:38:11] <Trisox> data-roll=""
[05:38:27] <Trisox> data-yango=""
[05:38:33] <yango> well, that's not working for spets
[05:38:46] <Trisox> just joined so dont know what he said
[05:38:54] <yango> He want's to have el selected by data-tag value
[05:40:01] <Trisox> well depends on jquery version its added since 1.4.4
[05:40:05] <yango> <tr data-city="Newyork"><td>bleh</td></tr> and then find that tr based on the data-city attribute
[05:40:13] <faraway> jonathancutrell: you could set the target of the form to an iframe, and when the post is complete the server could create a script in that iframe that calls a "done" function in the parent
[05:40:27] <Trisox> yango: you can use attr for that 2
[05:40:58] <yango> spets: refer to Trisox and jonathancutrell, they have newer knowledge than I. Sorry for the misinformation
[05:40:58] <jonathancutrell> faraway: problem is, it's an octet stream.
[05:41:25] <yango> by the way, how can I stop a tab keypress event from being propagated to the browser?
[05:41:53] <stenno|work> yango, bind on body.keypressed :D
[05:41:58] <Trisox> yango: data-roll="" is so king ;-)  sometimes saves a roundtrip of ajax call
[05:41:58] <jonathancutrell> tango and others: http://jsfiddle.net/jcutrell/NPBUH/
[05:41:59] <jeffsmykil_> I nominate ajpiano as Slideshow Czar, no one can ever make a slideshow again without first consulting him
[05:42:03] <jonathancutrell> yango /\
[05:42:42] <Trisox> indeed jonathancutrell nice example ;)
[05:42:48] <yango> spets: http://jsfiddle.net/jcutrell/NPBUH/
[05:43:10] <Trisox> for older versions http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/NPBUH/1/
[05:43:18] <Flo0815> i have multiple input fields with class='test'. How can i chcek if one of those has an empty value the fastest way?
[05:44:21] <Trisox> yango: http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/NPBUH/2/ with jquery 1.4.2
[05:44:28] <Trisox> for example ;)
[05:45:17] <faraway> jonathancutrell: 1. send the data with form to server with target to iframe 2. server creates script in iframept that calls a "down" function in the parent with e.g. id of the generated file to download 3. you can provide the download link on the page or start download  ?? or it the sending already a problem ?
[05:45:35] <j0rd> I have a question about how to remove sizzle from jquery. I've followed this thread http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3952817/decoupling-jquery-sizzle which seems to be the authority on how to do so, but I'm getting an error

[05:46:14] <jonathancutrell> j0rd: That seems like an odd goal.
[05:46:21] <j0rd> not really
[05:46:25] <Trisox> jord wy sould you remove the sizzle engine
[05:46:27] <j0rd> cufon needs sizzle
[05:46:32] <Trisox> noo
[05:46:33] <j0rd> rest of my jquery ios huge
[05:46:40] <Trisox> no cufon
[05:46:46] <Trisox> bad you bad bad j0rd
[05:46:49] <j0rd> so, I want to load cufon + sizzle, then all my jquery
[05:46:57] <Trisox> http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator
[05:47:01] <j0rd> I dont like cufon either, but it needs to get done for client
[05:47:04] <Trisox> no cufon !
[05:47:05] <jonathancutrell> faraway: "down" as in download, I'm assuming.
[05:47:11] <Trisox> use @font-face
[05:47:28] <j0rd> Trisox: i know, that's what I use when I have a choice, but no choice here
[05:47:32] <j0rd> so, but to my question
[05:47:48] <j0rd> I need sizzle out of jquery
[05:47:49] <faraway> jonathancutrell: sorry :D  "done"   ;)
[05:47:59] <j0rd> and I need jquery tothen work, which it's currently not
[05:48:21] <Trisox> i dont see wy not load cufon after jquery
[05:48:25] <jonathancutrell> faraway: Well, the form is built and sent on "download" click.
[05:48:26] <j0rd> there's other reasons why you might want to do this as well, say if for what ever reason, something else you're using already has sizzle, so you don't need it in jquery
[05:48:27] <Trisox> and then your scripts
[05:48:36] <j0rd> Trisox: because it doesn't load the fonts soon enough
[05:49:01] <Trisox> load the fonts before jquery
[05:49:02] <Trisox> ;)
[05:49:09] <j0rd> Trisox: more importantly jquery is aggregated with the rest of my JS
[05:49:29] <Trisox> well this is wiered :)
[05:49:39] <j0rd> Trisox: just assume I don't have any other options
[05:49:45] <j0rd> Trisox: and also I'm curious about doing this
[05:50:40] <Trisox> j0rd: http://ejohn.org/
[05:50:54] <Trisox> there sizzle.js
[05:51:02] <marcoscerutti> Hi folks! I got a question. I have a php form that is rendered based on a database. I need to add a button on the side of one field, but it must be via javascript, as I can't change the form. what would be the best approach on this?
[05:51:10] <Jaycob> if I have two <div>'s on top of each other, can I get the other one by some selector if I know only the id of the other one?
[05:51:11] <j0rd> ya, so how  do I pull Sizzler out of jquery
[05:51:15] <j0rd> or get jquery with out sizzle
[05:51:23] <Trisox> as far as i know its intergrated highly
[05:51:30] <j0rd> Trisox: they're not
[05:51:37] <j0rd> they're decoupled, but in the same file
[05:52:23] <Trisox> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3952817/decoupling-jquery-sizzle
[05:52:32] <j0rd> Trisox: i posted that link already
[05:52:35] <Trisox> i got no time to figgure it out now sorry
[05:52:37] <j0rd> Trisox: not working, anything else
[05:52:41] <Trisox> nope
[05:53:03] <Trisox> ask ajpiano he might know
[05:53:20] <j0rd> k thx
[05:53:31] <Trisox> he knows almost all ;)
[05:54:05] <rines> hi everybody. Is is possible to "merge" two click elements of one element? for example $(".test").click(function(){ RUN1 } and another click function{ RUN2 }
[05:55:33] <stenno|work> click(function(){ RUN1; RUN2});
[05:55:52] <swombat> Is there a way to use components like the jquery mobile flip toggle switch without actually loading up the whole jquery mobile framework? (I'm already using bootstrap)
[05:56:38] <stenno|work> swombat, just copy and paste the relevant function from the unminified source
[05:56:46] <swombat> will that work?
[05:56:57] <stenno|work> yes, why wouldn't it
[05:58:01] <swombat> it's not a function... it's a "data-role" thingy involving a slider
[05:58:37] <D4> So I've got a set of background images which I animate by altering their positions on window.scroll. However in webkit, since they're 1920x1280 in dimension, it's a bit choppy. In firefox, it's choppy the first time then really really fluid. In webkit it's a bit choppy all the time. Would I benefit from preloading these images somehow? Any tips on optimization or tips to decrease the stutter? :)
[05:59:50] <marcoscerutti> Hi folks! I got a question. I have a php form that is rendered based on a database. I need to add a button on the side of one field, but it must be via javascript, as I can't change the form. what would be the best approach on this?
[06:00:50] <jeffsmykil_> marcoscerutti:  what does the button do?
[06:01:21] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: its to trigger an script that loads address based on the zip code
[06:01:37] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: I can't change the form as its a buddy press one
[06:01:46] <jeffsmykil_> couldn't you just append it to the form?
[06:02:01] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: I did try, but nothing happens
[06:02:22] <marcoscerutti> Im not sure if the js is not able to catch the ids of the fields
[06:02:52] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: I did a try to append it to the body, but wasn't successful
[06:03:52] <jeffsmykil_> then you are probably doing it wrong
[06:04:03] <jeffsmykil_> can you us jsfiddle and do a barebones example?
[06:04:19] <marcoscerutti> Let me get it jeffsmykil_
[06:06:15] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: http://jsfiddle.net/evSkw/
[06:07:00] <jeffsmykil_> spanish or portugese?
[06:07:06] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: the button should sits into the first loop
[06:07:14] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: portuguese
[06:08:09] <jeffsmykil_> well my portugese vocabulary is like 20 words but ill try
[06:08:21] <marcoscerutti> WOW thats brilliant!
[06:08:23] <stenno|work> se habla espaniol!
[06:09:14] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_ it connects to a site where it loads the data, based on the zip code…
[06:09:17] <Yancho> guys anyone can suggest whan i need to do to get this thingy working please? http://soc.um.edu.mt/tsa/pastpapers_new/ -im trying to use jquery to cycle between the old and the new div
[06:10:00] <jeffsmykil_> marcoscerutti: it's hard to work on because you have a bunch of errors in the console
[06:10:14] <marcoscerutti> on the js side? :(
[06:10:32] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: or due the php file?
[06:10:32] <Mr_DeLeTeD> Someone know a solution for make a $.ajax() without attach the HTTP Request ?
[06:10:49] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: want an html of the form?
[06:11:47] <jeffsmykil_> marcoscerutti: not sure why something like this wouldnt work for you
[06:11:48] <jeffsmykil_> $("body").append("<input type = 'button' value = 'Button' onClcik='foo()' /> ");
[06:11:58] <jeffsmykil_> or something similar
[06:12:02] <jeffsmykil_> i am no ninja
[06:12:29] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: Im trying it from zero again
[06:12:30] <jeffsmykil_> are you portugese or brazillian?
[06:12:39] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: on a simple form, it all work fine
[06:12:51] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: brazilian, são paulo city

[06:16:10] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: yeah man, there is some good guys on this, indeed!
[06:16:40] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: capoeira was played by the slaves, back in the days. its damn cool
[06:16:59] <jeffsmykil_> marcoscerutti: yes, with razor blads between their toes
[06:18:18] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: man, I saw one guys playing it with 2 bastions on each
[06:18:20] <johnline3> i am defining where a slideshow script should look for the thumbnail images with this:
[06:18:21] <johnline3> thumb:$(img).attr('../' + 'src'),
[06:18:26] <marcoscerutti> damn, it was really nice
[06:18:34] <jeffsmykil_> capoeira is beautiful
[06:20:41] <marcoscerutti> where in US you live man?
[06:21:11] <jeffsmykil_> New Hampshire
[06:21:18] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: I know south US have lots of african heritage, and lots of related culture
[06:21:31] <jeffsmykil_> yeah, NH does not
[06:21:35] <stenno|work> nethack?
[06:21:37] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: those guys in africa know the shit man
[06:21:38] <stenno|work> oh, new hapshire
[06:21:52] <jeffsmykil_> well we have a lot of somalian refugees in proportion to our population
[06:22:02] <jeffsmykil_> stenno|work: you have an widget experience?
[06:22:11] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: I thought it was exclusive to Finland hehe
[06:22:48] <stenno|work> jeffsmykil_, widget?
[06:23:13] <durre> hi! is there a way to make JSONP requests, and handle different errors? like: 404, 401, 500? or are there better alternatives to jsonp?
[06:23:40] <jeffsmykil_> jquery ui stenno|work
[06:24:06] <stenno|work> oh no, only a little bit
[06:24:10] <stenno|work> where did that come from
[06:24:19] <innociv> I forgot what the best way to see if key "foo" is in {{"foo":"bar"},{"1":"2"}}  I guess i need to .each() and check each key?
[06:24:22] <stenno|work> durre, you can use $.ajax
[06:24:40] <stenno|work> innociv, you can iterate through the keys with for loop
[06:24:51] <stenno|work> like this
[06:25:00] <stenno|work> for (var key in myobject)
[06:25:03] <innociv> er [{"foo":"bar"},{"1":"2"}] rather
[06:25:17] <stenno|work> ah this is jquery
[06:25:41] <innociv> Yeah $.each() is the jqueryey way I guess.
[06:26:00] <granden> Is it possible to style a jquery ui element without editeding the jquery.ui.css file? Because I want to change the color just for a single element.
[06:26:18] <durre> stenno|work: I am using $.ajax … but it always enters the success method, never the error method
[06:26:40] <jeffsmykil_> stenno|work: trying to figure out how to send object and function
[06:26:56] <adam007> any one here know about lightbox with html tag ?
[06:27:59] <stenno|work> durre, i don't really know if XHR sends normal http status codes tbh >_>"
[06:29:20] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano: I have a jQuery UI Widget question for you when you rise from the grave
[06:29:55] <stenno|work> but its strange, $.ajax should allow to bind on XhrReadyStateChanged
[06:30:00] <stenno|work> or whatsitcalled
[06:30:29] <jeffsmykil_> there a lot of good stuff on google about dealing with ajax message cases
[06:34:10] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil_: whats up
[06:34:34] <jeffsmykil_> I think i figured it outm I was going to ask how to pass a function and options
[06:34:44] <jeffsmykil_> but i looked closer at your slides and found something
[06:35:01] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: on jsfiddle am I able to see an error console?
[06:35:10] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano: you'd be so proud of me, I'm writting a widget
[06:35:17] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil_: :)
[06:35:18] <jeffsmykil_> marcoscerutti: firebug sure
[06:35:34] <marcoscerutti> thanks mate
[06:35:36] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano: I'm shocked at how easy it has been thus far
[06:35:42] <ajpiano> exactly
[06:35:49] <jeffsmykil_> if i can do it anyone can
[06:36:03] <ajpiano> it's the combination of it doing a lot for you, and you having learned enough to be ready to use it ;)
[06:36:18] <jeffsmykil_> I'm growing up so fast!
[06:36:34] <jeffsmykil_> you are slideshow czar ajpiano I have declared
[06:36:35] <ajpiano> our little boy!!!
[06:36:45] <jeffsmykil_> all future slideshows must be approved by you
[06:36:55] <ajpiano> haha i am no such thing, i just stole some other people's slideshows and made some pretty slideshows of my own
[06:37:11] <jeffsmykil_> yeah but yours are hilarious and informative
[06:37:30] <ajpiano> ?mlm
[06:37:31] <bot-t> much like myself
[06:37:47] <ajpiano> ;)
[06:38:29] <jeffsmykil_> im now adding an update function to my widget
[06:38:47] <jeffsmykil_> pretty exciting stuff, makes the day go faster when you are learning new stuff and its fun
[06:41:31] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano what does the type part do when you trigger destroy on slide 16?
[06:41:39] <jeffsmykil_> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide16
[06:42:39] <ajpiano> it makes it so there's a destroy event that fires
[06:43:02] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano this is where I'm having trouble:
[06:43:03] <jeffsmykil_> $(".widgetContainer").dashboardCount("update", {title: "Inspections2", count: counts2, units: units });
[06:43:38] <ajpiano> what about it is troublesome
[06:43:48] <jeffsmykil_> im going to make a fiddle
[06:43:52] <jeffsmykil_> hold on one second
[06:45:10] <kavelot> any ideas why I'm getting different values with $('#face').width() vs $('#face').get(0).width?
[06:45:51] <xec|work> kavelot: .get() returns a DOM element, try .eq()
[06:46:30] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: I guess I screwed up my code hehe http://jsfiddle.net/evSkw/2/
[06:46:48] <kavelot> xec|work: I really want the DOM element... I'm wondering why it's different though
[06:47:09] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: I got an error about my function not been defined
[06:47:17] <xec|work> kavelot: ah i see, well - different browser calculates width differently, jquery normalizes this
[06:47:52] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano not sure how to put this in jsfiddle and make it work
[06:48:07] <ajpiano> load in jquery ui and the css as external resources?
[06:48:31] <jeffsmykil_> its the external widget js thats giving me trouble
[06:48:38] <ajpiano> it's part of ui
[06:48:45] <jeffsmykil_> I mean my code
[06:49:03] <xec|work> kavelot: so natively reported width will differ between browsers, while jquery's .width() should stay the same
[06:49:12] <ajpiano> just put it in the JS section of the fiddle
[06:49:41] <unclemantis> any jCrop gurus in here?
[06:50:04] <xec|work> unclemantis: i'm not!
[06:50:22] <unclemantis> 1 down 994 to go!
[06:50:26] <unclemantis> 993 to go!
[06:50:45] <xec|work> weird that so few answered, huh
[06:51:20] <jeffsmykil_> marcoscerutti: I don't understand, what are you returning to the button, and why?
[06:51:29] <unclemantis> xec|work not sure about weird
[06:52:22] <marcoscerutti> oh damn!
[06:52:34] <marcoscerutti> nothing to return there mate
[06:53:03] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: Im in a hurry and I wrote things on wrong place while ago
[06:53:54] <unclemantis> i think i might have found some documents to read
[06:55:51] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: I just corrected the code, but still facing same undefined function. Im reading line by line and can't find the bug...
[06:56:18] <jeffsmykil_> whats the new number?
[06:56:20] <jeffsmykil_> 3?
[06:57:22] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: was it for me mate?
[06:57:29] <jeffsmykil_> marcoscerutti:  http://jsfiddle.net/evSkw/4/
[06:57:32] <jeffsmykil_> try that
[06:58:15] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: black magic? :o
[06:58:33] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: shouldn't the form submission do that?
[06:58:35] <jeffsmykil_> nah i can just never get inline html onclick syntax right
[06:59:18] <jeffsmykil_> well you can make that button do whatever
[06:59:21] <jeffsmykil_> just change the function
[06:59:29] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: and it looks way better on the code too… inline stuff isn't nice. but as Im newbie… you know hehe
[07:01:37] <sviatovigt> I have a span element and inside it a link
[07:02:03] <sviatovigt> how can I do that on("click") to execute the same action as pressing the link itself
[07:02:06] <sviatovigt> like a button
[07:02:35] <stenno|work> sviatovigt, you can bind normally on click
[07:02:43] <stenno|work> like you would do with any other element
[07:02:51] <jeffsmykil_> $("span").click(function() { $("a").click() });
[07:02:58] <stenno|work> so $(myspan).click(function
[07:02:59] <stenno|work> ^
[07:03:04] <stenno|work> what jeffsmykil_ wrote
[07:03:46] <sviatovigt> thank you
[07:09:32] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: check it here mate, the JS is there, dow on the bottom, but no elements can be rendered…  http://cnastrologia.org.br/site/register/?tipo=fisica
[07:09:56] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: line 754
[07:11:53] <jeffsmykil_> marcoscerutti: im actually working with someone right now, could you ask the room again, or wait a little bit?
[07:12:16] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: sure mate :)
[07:14:25] <sviatovigt> how can I select the descendant of this ?
[07:14:38] <radiantstatic> What would be the best way to fade a bg image out and a new one in simultaneously on hover?
[07:20:33] <jeffsmykil_> marcoscerutti: ive got a guy waiting on this code so it could be a while, very sorry
[07:20:56] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: nothing to be sorry mate :)
[07:21:18] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: you are here helping, Im glad you gave me lots of enlightments already :)
[07:26:46] <Mkop> I want to switch stylesheets dynamically. anyone have an opinion on $("#custom_stylesheet").attr('href',new_href) vs deleting and readding the <link/> element?
[07:29:45] <rethus> i have a image.. on mouseover, a layer below that image should slideDown(), if leaving th image, or the layer, it should slideUp() after x seconds...
[07:29:58] <rethus> whats the best functions to cath those mouse-events?
[07:30:05] <rethus> mouseEnter, or MouseOver
[07:30:10] <rethus> or something else
[07:34:48] <lathan> ?hover @ rethus
[07:34:49] <bot-t> rethus, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[07:36:35] <DeltaHeavy> If I'm writing HTML at certain points in the code how do I link it to events? It seems if #door as drawn later, if I call $('#door') it doesn't know what #door is.
[07:37:11] <_studio> hi, can anyone recommend a basic image editing jquery plugin that allows cropping and other basic things like contrast like ebay has?
[07:41:09] <rethus> lathan: this only open and directly close it
[07:41:29] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/n3D8j/5/  http://jsfiddle.net/n3D8j/4/  "The object could not be cloned" on ev.source.postMessage(returnData, ev.origin);   I don't understand this error.
[07:41:30] <rethus> i need to open, if mouseover... and keep open... and only if i leavve... 3 seconds later to close
[07:42:11] <lathan> ?delay @ rethus
[07:42:11] <bot-t> rethus, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[07:42:16] <innociv> why can't I copy localstorage and return it?  I want the .length and all
[07:42:36] <rethus> lathan: yes, but than, i cant use hover
[07:43:37] <innociv> Like there is no length on new Object({"foo":"bar"}).length
[07:44:07] <lathan> rethus, try something like thsi: .hover(function(){ $(this).slideUp(); }, function(){ $(this).delay(3000).slideDown() })
[07:44:21] <lathan> ?mdc Object.length
[07:44:25] <bot-t> lathan, arguments - MDN - An Array -like object corresponding to the arguments passed to a function. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments
[07:44:57] <rethus> lathan: i didn't need to slide-up after 3 seconds... i need to keep open as long as the user mouseover the div... 1 second... 1 day, 1 week
[07:45:08] <rethus> and only if leave, than after 3 seconds close it
[07:45:34] <lathan> rethus, yes, hover only calls the 2nd function if the mouse leaves
[07:46:01] <lathan> rethus, see ?hover
[07:46:01] <bot-t> rethus, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[07:46:28] <lathan> rethus, unless you know *all* that hover does, you should read that link^
[07:46:33] <DerekPioneer> how do i do a one time bind
[07:46:38] <lathan> ?one @ DerekPioneer
[07:46:38] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[07:47:05] <innociv> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=667388
[07:47:06] <innociv> Sigh
[07:47:12] <innociv> Oh well I guess..
[07:47:26] <innociv> I better make a new object with a length key i guess
[07:49:11] <macmartine> How can you display a 'no results' response when nothing is returned from a jquery autocomplete search? http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[07:49:32] <macmartine> I can't find any callback that would be triggered in such a case, or anything
[07:49:34] <innociv> meh i'd need proto to do it properly, would I?  If I wanted myObject.length to return a lnegth
[07:49:36] <stenno|work> macmartine, i have a similar problem
[07:50:29] <stenno|work> macmartine, i don't think that such hook is provided
[07:51:00] <rethus>  lathan: k. thanks.. works now like a charm
[07:51:04] <stenno|work> macmartine, oh wait! does .select trigger..?
[07:51:17] <lathan> ?select
[07:51:18] <bot-t> .select(handler): Bind an event handler to the "select" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/select/
[07:51:24] <lathan> stenno|work, yes ^^
[07:51:39] <stenno|work> lathan, what
[07:51:48] <macmartine> how does that help?
[07:51:53] <stenno|work> that is not at all relevant, lathan
[07:51:55] <lathan> stenno|work, sorry, I budded into your question.
[07:51:58] <stenno|work> hehe
[07:52:24] <stenno|work> macmartine, maybe .select triggers even if no element was found?
[07:52:39] <stenno|work> otherwise, you might need to override search callback
[07:52:49] <lathan> stenno|work, macmartine select triggers when the users selects an option
[07:52:53] <lathan> source
[07:53:14] <macmartine> we're talking about a case when there are no results, so the user won't be selecting an option
[07:54:35] <innociv> 1336746732
[07:54:35] <innociv> 	"[object Object]"
[07:54:43] <innociv> wtf? Why is that [object Object] and not {etc}?
[07:55:09] <innociv> I'm doing localStorage[ev.data.key] = ev.data.data;
[07:56:07] <lathan> macmartine, prob the best solution is to override the source with a function of your own to do the search. and if there are no results
[07:56:20] <lathan> innociv, what browser? [object OBject] means it doesn't know how to stringifiy it
[07:56:47] <stenno|work> firebug could inspect that object
[07:56:48] <innociv> Firefox. New one
[07:56:53] <lathan> hm
[07:56:59] <innociv> i was looking in the dom and it showed that
[07:57:00] <innociv> in firebug
[07:57:11] <stenno|work> because you expressed as string
[07:57:19] <stenno|work> do it before casting
[07:57:27] <stenno|work> (implicit, would be my guess)
[07:58:48] <innociv> I did not.  $iframe[0].contentWindow.postMessage({"action":action, "key":key, "data":{"f":f, "m":message, "o":0}}, $iframefoo.attr('src'));   Then when I ask for it back... returnData = {"action":"get","data":localStorage[ev.data.key]};
[07:59:06] <sviatovigt> how can I get the descendant of $(this) ?
[07:59:14] <innociv> $(this).children()?
[08:00:00] <innociv> $("iframe")[1].contentWindow.postMessage({"action":"get","key":"1336746732"}, "*")  and firebug is saying Object { action="get", data="[object Object]"}
[08:00:29] <innociv> when "get" is "returnData = {"action":"get","data":localStorage[ev.data.key]};"
[08:02:19] <innociv> ... Oh I think I need to JSON stringify when i put an object in localstorage, don't i?
[08:03:38] <lathan> macmartine, you want a custom source function: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/HkwGt/
[08:04:25] <lathan> macmartine, I got the details about the filter and responce from: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple
[08:04:31] <fris> im using .change() for a select/options with ajax, when it picks the first one, it loads the content, but without the loading.gif, the 2nd time i do it, the loading.gif loads, any idea why?
[08:05:54] <lathan> ?livedemo @ fris
[08:05:54] <bot-t> fris, Please create a working demo of your problem on jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net. Please include the JS and CSS dependencies so we can see what you're talking about. Note: the script panes do not need script tags, or $(document).ready's, that is automatic
[08:06:15] <lathan> fris, that sounds like it should work...probably a problem with your specific implimentation
[08:06:22] <fris> lathan http://hotlinkers.com/archives/
[08:06:27] <bish0p_> anyone know a good solution for dealing with multilingual navigations the text obv gets longer if it german etc..which then overflows... i need to the font-size to reduce ???
[08:06:40] <sviatovigt> I have a span element and inside it a link
[08:06:56] <sviatovigt> I use this line $(this).children("a").click();
[08:07:06] <macmartine> lathan: nice, thanks!!!~
[08:07:14] <sviatovigt> if the user clicks the span instead of the link
[08:07:16] <lathan> macmartine, np
[08:07:24] <sviatovigt> but it enters into an infinite loop
[08:07:30] <sviatovigt> how can I avoid that?
[08:07:50] <lathan> sviatovigt, need more details, why is it looping? are you triggering a click inside a click event handler?
[08:08:02] <sviatovigt> yes
[08:08:42] <sviatovigt> because when I click the span, I trigger the action click of the link inside it
[08:08:47] <bish0p_> anyone know a good solution for dealing with multilingual navigations the text obv gets longer if its german etc..which then overflows... i need the font-size to reduce ???
[08:08:50] <sviatovigt> and it starts over and over again
[08:09:09] <sviatovigt> basically, I want that no matter if the user clicks the span or the link
[08:09:13] <innociv> Yeah that was it. Oops.
[08:09:13] <sviatovigt> to have the same result
[08:10:36] <lathan> fris, simple, #archive-wrapper has height: 0px set on it.
[08:10:40] <innociv> Before I try, since it's going to take some time, do any of you know if it's possible to put a callback in postMessage()?
[08:11:15] <bish0p_> any ideas?
[08:11:22] <lathan> sviatovigt, .click(function(e){ if($(e.target).is('span')) $(this).click() })
[08:11:32] <lathan> sviatovigt, nvmind
[08:11:38] <lathan> ?on @ sviatovigt
[08:11:38] <bot-t> sviatovigt, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:12:02] <lathan> $(this).on('click', 'a', function(){....})
[08:12:09] <fris> ahh thanks lathan had overflow:hidden
[08:12:17] <sviatovigt> this is how I enter in the infinite loop
[08:12:19] <lathan> that filters the event to "click" events on 'a'
[08:12:33] <sviatovigt> I will paste the code on jsfiddle
[08:12:45] <lathan> sviatovigt, the secret is to use methods that filter the event, so it only is fired on the a itself
[08:12:52] <lathan> sviatovigt, yay fiddle!
[08:13:50] <sviatovigt> you don't like jsfiddle?
[08:14:04] <DerekPioneer> jsfiddle is half of what makes javascript so fun
[08:15:28] <sviatovigt> it's just a way of sharing code...
[08:15:56] <DerekPioneer> no its pretty sweet to be able to test things fast
[08:16:09] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/n3D8j/13/ Looks like I can't have a function returned?
[08:16:11] <DerekPioneer> half was ambitious
[08:16:15] <innociv> I get that can't be cloned error again.
[08:16:24] <innociv> How can I unwrap and rewrap a function? Maybe that'll do it
[08:17:33] <innociv> wait wtf
[08:17:34] <innociv> ...
[08:17:40] <innociv> That error is for the localSTorage thing.
[08:18:00] <innociv> Oh no it's not. It just does it when trying to have a callback
[08:18:28] <sviatovigt> lathan: http://jsfiddle.net/SvG97/
[08:18:54] <sviatovigt> DerekPioneer: I don't get it... but it doesn't matter
[08:18:54] <lathan> sviatovigt, I love jsfiddle...
[08:19:18] <sviatovigt> what means yay then?
[08:19:19] <lathan> sviatovigt, please add jQuery into the fiddle so I can work with it
[08:19:25] <lathan> Yay! cheer!
[08:19:35] <lathan> Hurray!
[08:19:41] <sviatovigt> it isn't there?
[08:19:44] <jeffsmykil_> can you only update via key and value in widget factory?
[08:19:49] <sviatovigt> http://jsfiddle.net/SvG97/1/
[08:19:51] <innociv> Anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/n3D8j/13/  Why can't I pass a function through postMessage()? I want to have a callback
[08:19:52] <sviatovigt> try now
[08:20:08] <lathan> jsfiddle defaults to mootools
[08:20:32] <lathan> top left corner, option menu. change mootools to jQuery
[08:20:33] <sviatovigt> I'm using jquery
[08:20:48] <sviatovigt> http://jsfiddle.net/SvG97/2/
[08:20:50] <lathan> ah...vs2
[08:21:12] <lathan> ?on @ lathan
[08:21:12] <bot-t> lathan, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:21:47] <lathan> okay... don't use the variable this as the selector
[08:21:50] <sviatovigt> but I'm using .on ...
[08:21:52] <lathan> if you don't need it, leave it out
[08:22:11] <sviatovigt> each link has a different path...
[08:22:24] <sviatovigt> so I want to act as I'm pressing the link inside the same span
[08:22:25] <lathan> it handles each case automatically
[08:22:25] <ven0m> Hey guys. Here' my JS. i am loading it in the middle of the page. For some reason i am getting "jQuery is undefined" error when rearching the jQuery.ready() call. http://pastebin.com/Zq2PXc64
[08:22:44] <ven0m> the thing is - when i try to call jQuery functions through the console - i am able to do so
[08:22:57] <lathan> sviatovigt, the 2nd optional argument is the "selector" which allows you to filter which elements underneath alphabet-boxes
[08:23:11] <xec|work> my god, sviatovigt, why don't you just make the <a> bigger?
[08:23:16] <ven0m> The script is added using <script> tag which is NOT placed at the header
[08:23:18] <sviatovigt> can you please make the changes on the code?
[08:24:07] <sviatovigt> xec | work : :))))) I'm an idiot
[08:24:10] <sviatovigt> :)))))
[08:24:13] <sviatovigt> thanks
[08:24:23] <sviatovigt> I don't know what's wrong with me
[08:24:31] <sviatovigt> probably sleep depravation
[08:24:32] <sviatovigt> :)))
[08:24:49] <xec|work> nobody should be forced to code on fridays anyway ;)
[08:25:13] <sviatovigt> :))))
[08:25:14] <sviatovigt> true
[08:26:26] <ven0m> Hey guys. Here' my JS. i am loading it in the middle of the page. For some reason i am getting "jQuery is undefined" error when rearching the jQuery.ready() call. http://pastebin.com/Zq2PXc64
[08:26:33] <ven0m> The script is added using <script> tag which is NOT placed at the header
[08:26:40] <ven0m> the thing is - when i try to call jQuery functions through the console - i am able to do so
[08:27:29] <lathan> sviatovigt, wierd...I need to learn .on better, because the selector is giving me grief
[08:29:31] <lathan> ven0m, well, at the risk of saying a copy error, I don't see function tiyug defined anywhere...
[08:30:14] <ven0m> this a snippet. the original js is much longer
[08:30:22] <lathan> so it does have that function?
[08:30:27] <ven0m> yes
[08:31:04] <bish0p_> anyone help?
[08:31:44] <xec|work> ven0m: is this some code that has worked before or are you trying something new?
[08:31:52] <ven0m> Is it possible that jQuery.ready is being called beforethe jQuery is loaded from the external surce?
[08:32:08] <xec|work> that would be the logical explanation, yes
[08:32:14] <ven0m> Yes. The part i've added starts from Tiyoog Object
[08:32:26] <xec|work> i don't know what that means
[08:33:01] <lathan> ven0m, it works for me in a jsfiddle...http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rnnLA/1/
[08:33:02] <ven0m> xec|work how can i make the code that is currently in ready() to execute once jQuery is loaded?
[08:33:02] <lathan>  http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rnnLA/1/
[08:33:32] <lathan> ven0m, I don't think you want to put it in ready
[08:33:50] <ven0m> Yeah, i agree
[08:33:53] <lathan> ven0m, if you are loading jQuery after the page load, your code should just be executed, no ready()
[08:34:01] <lathan> redundant...
[08:34:21] <lathan> ven0m, I'm not sure what you are doing, but in the fiddle I just posted I have it working just fine
[08:34:32] <lathan> ven0m, all I did was change the source of jQuery to google api
[08:34:46] <ven0m> The code i am editing uses jQ 1.2
[08:34:53] <ven0m> which by it self could be the problem
[08:35:17] <ven0m> the thing is - i am editing a product which relies on it, and i wouldnt want to break anything by replacing it
[08:35:20] <lathan> 1.2 works just fine: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rnnLA/1/
[08:35:33] <lathan> ven0m, firebug the script tag that your real page creates
[08:35:43] <lathan> ven0m, make sure the path is right, and that what the script loads is actually jquery
[08:35:50] <nathanstaines> with all the parallax scrolling tutorials out there can anyone point me in the direction of a solid/efficient cross-browser one?
[08:35:59] <ven0m> lathan, i've tried placing the code current in "ready" in a regular function and calling it
[08:36:13] <ven0m> i still got $ undefined
[08:36:29] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: Still around mate?
[08:36:33] <ven0m> lathan i did. After everything loaded i've tried calling jQuery methods
[08:36:36] <xec|work> ven0m: lathan is trying to tell you -- this is not gonna work http://jsfiddle.net/rnnLA/3/
[08:36:46] <xec|work> ven0m: do you see why?
[08:36:47] <ven0m> aswell as checking jQuery is defined
[08:37:05] <lathan> ven0m, then check the script tag...(I said that 2 lines )
[08:37:13] <lathan> xec|work, his pastebin is missing the function declaration
[08:37:32] <xec|work> what?
[08:37:35] <ven0m> lathan - i did. the source is correct
[08:37:37] <lathan> ven0m, compare your site to this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rnnLA/2/
[08:37:48] <jeffsmykil_> can i not pass setOption an array as a value?
[08:38:05] <lathan> ven0m, oh. so you are trying to use jQuery inline directly after the start of the script tag placement?
[08:38:13] <lathan> ven0m, before the script onload has called?
[08:38:28] <xec|work> that seems to be the issue
[08:38:36] <lathan> ven0m, the milliseonds between the script tag added, and it actually loading are huge in code running time
[08:38:51] <lathan> ven0m, I thought you had the setTimeout and calling a function (which would fix it)
[08:39:33] <lathan> ven0m, okay...on line 20, when you add the script tag, javascript moves on executing without waiting for the script tag to load
[08:39:44] <lathan> ven0m, so line 29 is running before jQuery is fully loaded
[08:39:53] <lathan> ven0m, and it goes, jQuery is undefined
[08:40:02] <marcoscerutti> Folks, I got a js that should load data into a form when I click a button, but not to submit it. the validation I need occurs, but the page get refreshed. any idea how I get out of this?
[08:40:05] <ven0m> sec lemme see what happens on line 29
[08:40:12] <ven0m> 29 of the pastebin i've gave you?
[08:40:24] <lathan> yes
[08:40:27] <jeffsmykil_> marcoscerutti: prevent default
[08:40:34] <lathan> its the ready() line
[08:40:46] <lathan> ?preventDefault @ marcoscerutti, jeffsmykil_
[08:40:48] <bot-t> lathan, Couldn't find "preventDefault @ marcoscerutti, jeffsmykil_" in jQuery Docs.
[08:40:53] <lathan> ?preventDefault
[08:40:53] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[08:41:30] <lathan> ven0m, see the comment in the bottom of this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rnnLA/4/
[08:41:34] <ven0m> lathan i see. Than how can i prevent that behavior?
[08:41:36] <marcoscerutti> this button loads data from another site and populates address. this is nt the one that should send the form :)
[08:42:14] <lathan> ven0m, if you add jQuery after the page loads, you must call a function (like tiyug_zone_1039) and run all your jQuery inside that function (althought the setTimeout is not required)
[08:42:43] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/n3D8j/24/ What am I doing wrong trying to stringify and prase through postMessage()?
[08:43:16] <ven0m> Can i call cal the rest of the code right after tiyug_zone_1039 (directly following line 23) ?
[08:43:38] <lathan> ven0m, it would need to be inside the function called from the script.onload
[08:43:44] <lathan> ven0m, (okay...simplest fiddle yet: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rnnLA/5/)
[08:44:17] <ven0m> Yeah. I see
[08:44:28] <ven0m> Appriciate the help
[08:44:36] <ven0m> Thank you
[08:44:46] <lathan> np
[08:44:57] <lathan> I feel for you...tricky stuff importing jQuery later
[08:45:06] <ven0m> Yeah
[08:45:17] <ven0m> I thing is
[08:45:30] <ven0m> i dont have the freedome of changing that stuff
[08:45:46] <lathan> which stuff?
[08:45:47] <ven0m> stince is a part of bigger project which was partially given to me
[08:45:56] <lathan> is your project publicly available?
[08:45:59] <ven0m> For example chaing the onload method
[08:46:02] <ven0m> No
[08:46:41] <lathan> ven0m, so further up on the page, jQuery is dynamically loaded, and you can't get code into the onload function?
[08:47:56] <ven0m> I dont want to mix those 2 methods togather. The method called in onload has a different responsibility
[08:48:09] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/n3D8j/31/ here a better jsfiddle with some console logging.
[08:48:23] <innociv> JSON.parse doesn't seem to be working
[08:48:39] <lathan> ven0m, see the last function in this fiddle (wait_for_jQuery): http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rnnLA/8/
[08:49:05] <lathan> ven0m, careful with the Timeout interval, too fast will slow the computer down, too slow will give you more delay on the code running
[08:49:05] <johnkpaul> innociv: I don't see json.parse anywhere in that code
[08:49:10] <ven0m> lathan thats exactly what i was going to do
[08:49:15] <innociv> in the iframe
[08:49:17] <ven0m> set a timeout
[08:49:20] <innociv> I'm using postMessage()
[08:49:24] <ven0m> i hate that solution though
[08:49:26] <ven0m> kinda messy
[08:49:29] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/n3D8j/30/
[08:49:33] <ven0m> ill see what my PM has to say about that
[08:49:37] <lathan> JSON.stringify @ johnkpaul
[08:49:56] <lathan> ven0m, I know...its bad....no other way....
[08:50:03] <lathan> ven0m, not without argueing over the onload function
[08:50:13] <lathan> script.onload = function(){ their_func(); your_func() }
[08:50:22] <ven0m> I guess i better get my axe
[08:50:26] <lathan> lol
[08:50:32] <ven0m> thank you lathan
[08:50:34] <ven0m> seriously
[08:50:37] <lathan> np
[08:54:45] <hlveheart> Not sure if this is new, but i just realized I can create playlist radio stations
[08:54:49] <hlveheart> I am in fucking love.
[08:54:54] <hlveheart> THANK YOU DEVS.
[08:54:59] <hlveheart> you beautiful, beautiful people.
[08:55:01] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/n3D8j/31/ JSON.parse doesn't seem to be working in the iframe. I can't figure why
[08:55:12] <hlveheart> oh god damn it
[08:55:13] <hlveheart> wrong channel
[08:55:14] <hlveheart> LOL
[08:55:34] <lathan> innociv, first thing I see, is that the frame load doesn't seem to be working
[08:55:37] <innociv> oh
[08:55:42] <innociv> it won't let me change ev.data is all
[08:55:45] <lathan> http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/n3D8j/32/
[08:56:34] <velcrobots> having some sort of conflict - the last DocReady function I have here works without the others above it, but when I include them (they work on other pieces of the page not included in this fiddle) nothing happens when clicking the headings: http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/CuTvp/
[08:57:00] <xec|work> innociv: what do you expect the result to be?
[08:57:08] <innociv> seems perfectly fine to me, lathan
[08:57:27] <lathan> innociv, idk, I'm just not getting the console.log in the .load event
[08:57:27] <innociv> xec|work, for ev.data = JSON.parse(ev.data); to set ev.data as itself but parsed
[08:57:43] <innociv> weird, lathan.
[08:58:11] <lathan> innociv, okay....must be my browser...alert worked
[08:58:18] <innociv> mhm
[08:58:59] <Guevara> hello! bootbox confirm window not works http://dpaste.com/746661/
[08:58:59] <lathan> innociv, just upgrade to FF 12
[08:59:11] <innociv> Huh?
[08:59:21] <innociv> What makes you think I'm not using FF12?
[08:59:52] <innociv> Your browser is the one with the problem, not mine. :p

[09:03:41] <lathan> innociv, okay...what isn't working?
[09:03:48] <topriddy> hello good people.
[09:03:52] <innociv> for ev.data = JSON.parse(ev.data); to set ev.data as itself but parsed
[09:04:22] <innociv> var dara = JSON.parse(ev.data); sets data as ev.data but parsed.
[09:04:35] <innociv> Don't understand why i can't overwrite that variable.
[09:04:41] <topriddy> am having to try this: <li id="manageSupervisors"><a href="#">Manage Supervisors</a></li> i want to be able to know which a link is clicked and then reach for its immediate <li> tag so i can change its class
[09:04:50] <studio_> hi, when using getjson, how do i extract each key string and value string when cycling through the data?
[09:04:56] <topriddy> am having a number of <li> with nested <a>
[09:05:06] <johnkpaul> ?each @studio_
[09:05:06] <bot-t> studio_, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:05:32] <johnkpaul> or studio_, you can use for( var key in obj){}
[09:05:48] <johnkpaul> ?parent @ topriddy
[09:05:49] <bot-t> topriddy, .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[09:06:21] <studio_> ohh thanks johnkpaul i was going going to use for (i = 0;i < data.length;i++)
[09:06:40] <studio_> infact, i need to use bhoth
[09:06:41] <johnkpaul> studio_: there is no length property to a json object
[09:06:46] <studio_> oh i see
[09:06:48] <johnkpaul> well, there is no length property by itself
[09:06:54] <johnkpaul> unless you specically add one
[09:06:59] <johnkpaul> ?eval {}.length
[09:07:02] <bot-t> johnkpaul: SyntaxError: syntax error
[09:07:08] <johnkpaul> ?eval ({}).length
[09:07:09] <bot-t> johnkpaul: undefined
[09:07:09] <johnkpaul> :)
[09:07:19] <johnkpaul> damn hidden blocks
[09:07:21] <studio_> i see thanks for explaining!
[09:07:27] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun
[09:07:34] <studio_> as ever ;)
[09:08:24] <lathan> ?mdc event.data
[09:08:28] <bot-t> lathan, Creating Custom Events That Can Pass Data - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Creating_Custom_Events_That_Can_Pass_Data
[09:08:38] <topriddy> johnkpaul: probably what i need
[09:08:54] <xec|work> innociv: i don't get the whole JSON thing you got going, but, aren't you looking for ev.message.data not ev.data?
[09:09:12] <innociv> No
[09:11:09] <ven0m> lathan still here?
[09:11:16] <lathan> innociv, I don't know, but it seems that the ev.data just is read-only
[09:11:30] <lathan> innociv, can't find any docs about it...try a simplier fiddle with just a regular event
[09:11:39] <lathan> ven0m, yah
[09:12:08] <ven0m> http://jsfiddle.net/eXj5r/1/ here the updated code.
[09:12:24] <ven0m> for some reason i am still getting $ is undefined when Calling Tiyoog.open()
[09:12:57] <ven0m> Also, i've tried checking if jQuery is defined in the console - and its not
[09:16:04] <ven0m> lathan any ideas?
[09:17:02] <ven0m> perhaps i should define define Tiyoog within the scope of initLightbox?
[09:17:47] <lathan> ven0m, click on jsLint
[09:18:11] <ven0m> what>
[09:18:12] <ven0m> ?
[09:18:28] <lathan> in jsfiddle, there is a button that says "JSLint"
[09:18:55] <lathan> ven0m, its a code checker
[09:19:05] <studio_> using for (var key in el) {... gives key as undefined
[09:19:07] <lathan> ven0m, you have parentheses instead of curly braces. ) instead of }
[09:19:20] <studio_> where el is an object like {foo:bar,....}
[09:19:21] <lathan> studio_, this is jquery, see ?jQuery.each
[09:19:21] <bot-t> studio_, jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[09:19:42] <lathan> studio_, $.each(el, function(key, obj){ .... })
[09:19:50] <studio_> oh
[09:20:20] <lathan> studio_, we don't like seeing for(var key in obj).....when jQuery will do it for us
[09:20:47] <studio_> but wouldn't for (var key in obj) be faster as that's essentially what jq does
[09:20:51] <johnkpaul> :) lathan, I don't know if that's everyone's opinion
[09:21:18] <johnkpaul> studio_: "faster" probably doesn't matter, but it is probably slightly faster, and has less function call/creation overhead
[09:21:32] <johnkpaul> I prefer for key in obj for readability though, but $.each will do the same
[09:22:05] <lathan> okay....lol
[09:22:16] <lathan> "we": me
[09:22:18] <lathan> lol
[09:22:41] <johnkpaul> :)
[09:22:46] <ven0m> lathan gocha. Uploading fixed code
[09:24:07] <ven0m> lathan thank you once more :)
[09:24:17] <lathan> okay, bye
[09:24:18] <studio_> mhh, it would appear i'm being a retard :(
[09:24:25] <johnkpaul> ?demo @studio_
[09:24:26] <bot-t> studio_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:25:54] <marcoscerutti> jeffsmykil_: thanks a lot man! form fixed!
[09:28:10] <studio_> yep, just working on doing that now actually ;)
[09:30:42] <studio_> heh, of course, it would work in a fiddle
[09:31:03] <studio_> http://jsfiddle.net/KVfTC/
[09:31:42] <viky> hey guys, I'm trying to understand jquery source for event handling. especially the part that implements the functionality of "live" and "delegate" - adding event listeners to elements that are to be added in future.
[09:31:51] <johnkpaul> studio_: http://jsfiddle.net/KVfTC/1/
[09:31:53] <viky> but couldn't understand much
[09:32:11] <viky> can someone point me to the right part of code that implements it?
[09:32:40] <johnkpaul> viky: this is an older version of jquery
[09:32:45] <johnkpaul> but will be good for learning
[09:32:45] <johnkpaul> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.fn.live
[09:33:28] <viky> thanks johnkpaul. looking at it
[09:34:54] <studio_> ohhh thanks johnkpaul
[09:34:57] <studio_> works a treat
[09:35:06] <johnkpaul> no problem studio_, have fun
[09:35:14] <studio_> i am!
[09:37:33] <PhonicUK> hey all
[09:42:44] <danijoomla> hello
[09:45:07] <danijoomla> ls
[09:52:51] <LotR> is there a (sample) plugin somewhere that does everything Plugins/Authoring talks about?
[10:00:22] <balsd> how does jquery handle the form data for a vector?
[10:04:53] <prc384> I have .selectable on all divs.  can anyone tell me how to only change the class of the currently selected div?
[10:05:19] <balsd> i have a series of parameters. i'd like to do one get request of all the parameters. what is the proper way to do this?
[10:05:52] <dddbmt> Can anyone tell me why this alerts "null" in IE but no other browser? https://gist.github.com/2661020
[10:05:55] <ajpiano> prc384: use the events, selected and unselected
[10:05:58] <ajpiano> to add and remove a class
[10:06:05] <ajpiano> on the event.target or something in the ui object
[10:10:21] <jeffsmykil_> mental note: don't use a beta text editor at work
[10:11:19] <balsd> if i want to send an object to the server using JSON.stringify then do i have to do $.ajax({}) or is there a way to do it with $.getJSON(){}
[10:12:21] <tomasm-> hi, is there a decent wysiwyg editor written in pure jquery? tinymce is really nice and more user friendly, but adding plugins is awful... the API is bloated and ugly and i'd wish there was something where you can edit/save rich content using jquery code (the jquery wrapper to the tinymce code is really very thin)
[10:23:01] <Guevara> hi! how to cancel preventDefault http://dpaste.com/746661/ ?
[10:25:57] <prc384> still cant do it.  Lol if i have an image and I want an even to only act on the currently selected image how do i do that?
[10:26:12] <rroelofs> tomasm-: On my most recent project I used CKEditor instead of tiny_mce.  still cumbersome
[10:27:07] <bartmax> easy way to do siblings() including the picked element ?
[10:27:07] <bartmax> $('li:first').siblings() <-- how can i make to return li:first also.
[10:27:53] <rroelofs> Guevara: are you sure that is your problem.  the click on 'yes' is a separate event
[10:28:39] <rroelofs> bartmax: ? andSelf
[10:28:41] <Guevara> but not works,when i click in "yes" the exclusion not occurs
[10:29:08] <Guevara> i put a "return true" inside but not works to
[10:30:12] <rroelofs> Guevara: I know nothing about bootbox so I can only guess
[10:30:13] <bartmax> what's that ?
[10:30:21] <bartmax> ? andSelf
[10:30:22] <bot-t> .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[10:30:35] <jeffsmykil_> ajpiano: you interested in seeing what i came up with?
[10:30:39] <Guevara> http://dpaste.com/746705/ i tried this
[10:30:41] <bartmax> lets try
[10:31:12] <rroelofs> Guevara: what happens if you click "no"?
[10:31:21] <Guevara> nothing
[10:31:28] <Guevara> the same thing with "yes"
[10:31:46] <Guevara> the object is not remove
[10:33:00] <ajpiano> bartmax: $("li:first").parent().children() will give you them back in dom order, $("li:first").siblings().andSelf() will give you them all back but with the first one as the last element in the set
[10:33:22] <bartmax> ty ajpiano
[10:33:29] <Guevara> rroelofs: clicking in "no" the window is closed, the same behavior with "yes"
[10:34:48] <Guevara> i need cancel the preventDefault to continue the remove object
[10:36:40] <rroelofs> Guevara: preventDefault isn't your probem
[10:37:22] <Guevara> ok, why not remove the object in this function?
[10:37:44] <rroelofs> Guevara:  ?fiddle
[10:37:57] <d3d4ultr0> hey folks, <div class="lnk-button"><a class="load-chunk" href="/home.php">Continue</a></div>         This is a  button and I would like to change it to call $('#window_0').show(); How do I do it?
[10:38:19] <rroelofs> Guevara:   can you make a jsfiddle instead?  live code is much easier to debug
[10:40:14] <Guevara> rroelofs: the problem is that in jsfiffle will not have a object to remove
[10:41:54] <rroelofs> Guevara: you can include the necessary script / link tags in your jsfiddle html right?
[10:41:56] <d3d4ultr0> can I write it this way onclick="$('#window_0').show();"
[10:42:16] <d3d4ultr0> a href="onclick('$('#window_0').show();')"
[10:42:41] <Guevara> rroelofs: this running localhost
[10:42:49] <Guevara> need the method remove
[10:43:15] <Guevara> can not simulate a removal without the method and the object
[10:43:56] <jedimind> does anyone know of any issues w/ firefox and using .append('<img src=something >');
[10:43:56] <ircjsbot> jedimind, you have one new message, from gf3 (3 hours and 6 minutes ago). Tell me if you want to read it (“read”).
[10:44:27] <jeffsmykil_> i read that as a message from your girlfriend
[10:44:40] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, not sure if my post made it to this channel
[10:44:42] <jedimind> it may as well be
[10:44:52] <prc384> anyone know how to get the coords of all for corners of a box?
[10:44:53] <d3f4ultr0> did you see it? I need some help please
[10:45:20] <d3f4ultr0> if in case, can I write it this way onclick="$('#window_0').show();" ?
[10:45:43] <d3f4ultr0> inside <a href="#" onclick="$('#window_0').show();">
[10:47:49] <d3f4ultr0> it worked :)
[10:50:37] <fission6> is there a jquery means of JSON.stringify() i dont trust lal browsers having this, i need to serialize a small hashmap
[10:52:01] <felipe_Brz> say I have an array of <td> elements
[10:52:07] <felipe_Brz> how do i examine each one?
[10:52:11] <fission6> .eacg
[10:52:12] <fission6> .each
[10:52:23] <felipe_Brz> yeah but
[10:52:26] <johnkpaul-afk> fission6: no, there is not
[10:52:50] <felipe_Brz> if I do myarray.each(function(e){console.log(e);}); i just get numbers
[10:52:57] <felipe_Brz> i don't get each td
[10:53:08] <johnkpaul> felipe_Brz: the second argument is the element
[10:53:11] <johnkpaul> the first argument is the index
[10:53:19] <johnkpaul> function(index,element)
[10:53:22] <felipe_Brz> o
[10:53:28] <felipe_Brz> that explains things
[10:53:30] <d3f4ultr0> how do I shorten my onclick? <a href="#" onclick="var $this = $(this); var $modal = $this.closest('.modal'); $modal.fadeOut(); $('#window_0').show();return false;" class="load-chunk">Continue</a>
[10:53:32] <felipe_Brz> thank you
[10:53:38] <felipe_Brz> johnkpaul: ^
[10:53:50] <fission6> johnkpaul: well that stincts, i mean you can POST a datastructure so somewhere internal there must be right?
[10:56:07] <fission6> am i right?
[10:57:32] <johnkpaul> fission6: if you post a data structure, it gets converted to www/formencoded, not json
[10:58:06] <johnkpaul> fission6: add jQuery(".load-chunk").click(function(){//your stuff here})
[10:58:15] <johnkpaul> ^^ @ d3f4ultr0
[10:59:05] <fission6> johnkpaul: oh right
[10:59:51] <amccloud> is there any magic to quint test names? I can only seem to get test to work if I name them all the same
[11:02:44] <JesperA> Ok guys, i have a div that loads in stuff depending on what <select><option> you choose, it looks like this: $("categoryoption").load(this.value), works great with like <option value="foo.php"> the problem is that i want to use the value attr for something else, so i though, sure i just change it to <option dataurl="foooooo.php">   and   $("categoryoption").load(this.dataurl), that obviously didnt work. so any suggestion on what jQuery co
[11:03:24] <johnkpaul> amccloud: not that I know of
[11:03:26] <Lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/kEe8p/3/ - how can I grab each record returned?
[11:03:44] <Lundy> like a WHILE () { }
[11:03:51] <johnkpaul> ?data @ JesperA
[11:03:51] <bot-t> JesperA, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/

[11:04:32] <JesperA> johnkpaul, yeah i know about both of them, but i surely cant do .load.attr(dataurl)
[11:04:38] <d3f4ultr0> johnkpaul
[11:04:42] <johnkpaul> or Lundy, for(var key in obj){//use obj[key]}
[11:04:58] <d3f4ultr0> why you mentioned my nick?
[11:05:13] <johnkpaul> I answered your question earlier d3f4ultr0
[11:05:16] <d3f4ultr0> oh
[11:05:23] <d3f4ultr0> sorry, scrolling up
[11:05:30] <johnkpaul> JesperA: no, you can't do that,  you'll need to get the attr before you call load
[11:06:16] <johnkpaul> var $option = $("categoryoption");var url = $option.attr("whatever");$option.load(url) @JesperA
[11:06:49] <JesperA> thanks johnkpaul, i try that
[11:06:59] <johnkpaul> np, JesperA
[11:07:47] <d3f4ultr0> ah, this one, <johnkpaul> fission6: add jQuery(".load-chunk").click(function(){//your stuff here})
[11:08:04] <d3f4ultr0> johnkpaul, where do I put that?
[11:08:23] <johnkpaul> d3f4ultr0: in your javascript files, after jquery is loaded, inside document.ready
[11:08:35] <d3f4ultr0> sweet
[11:08:48] <d3f4ultr0> trying it now
[11:09:30] <Lundy> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/kEe8p/4/ - now I keep getting a alert saying "undefinded"
[11:10:16] <johnkpaul> hm, I'm getting no alert at all, Lundy
[11:10:22] <johnkpaul> are you trying to have the ajax call retry after some time
[11:10:23] <johnkpaul> ?
[11:11:09] <Lundy> im trying some Long Polling
[11:11:12] <d3f4ultr0> it worked !!!!!!!!!!!

[11:17:46] <jackp10> Hi to everyone
[11:17:46] <jackp10> c
[11:18:14] <cage> hello
[11:18:27] <cage> I want to ask for help
[11:18:35] <johnkpaul> ?ask @ cage
[11:18:35] <bot-t> cage, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:18:42] <jackp10> an someone help me in extract a part of a string using regexp ? I have this (onclick="showPlugin('basketadmin','/PORTAL/plugins/BASKETADMIN.php');return false;") and need to get only the link (/PORTAL/plugins/BASKETADMIN.php)… I have tried few options but no luck
[11:18:56] <Sebastian> I have a form where I need to validate a textfield with an ajax request and if the data is invalid i want prevent the default form action. The problem is that once the success callback returns the form has already submitted. How can I handle that?
[11:19:01] <cage> bot-t, OK
[11:19:03] <bot-t> cage, QUnit/ok - http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit/ok
[11:19:23] <johnkpaul> jackp10: try scriptular.com to help with testing
[11:19:37] <johnkpaul> ?event.preventDefault() @ Sebastian
[11:19:37] <bot-t> Sebastian, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:20:20] <jackp10> johnkpaul: i am using http://regexpal.com/ for testing
[11:20:30] <cage> This page http://service.fits.me/dev/Vfr.aspx?ArticleNumber=HCV4P01&nosurvey=1
[11:20:44] <jackp10> but I think i am doing something wrong because it does not return what i am expecting
[11:20:47] <cage> I want to make a copy of it by using php, but I do not how.
[11:20:52] <Sebastian> I know about preventDefault but when I call it in the success function of getJson it is to late as the form already submitte
[11:20:53] <Sebastian> d
[11:21:06] <cage> Which jquery does it probably use?
[11:21:26] <johnkpaul> jackp10: http://scriptular.com/#%5C(.*%5C)%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%5B%22onclick%3D%5C%22showPlugin('basketadmin'%2C'%2FPORTAL%2Fplugins%2FBASKETADMIN.php')%3Breturn%20false%3B%5C%22%22%5D
[11:21:41] <johnkpaul> Sebastian: so don't call it there, call it beforehand
[11:21:48] <johnkpaul> and if the validation is successful, submit the form directly
[11:22:09] <cage> Ok, no one noticing me.....
[11:22:24] <NoiseEee> cage: hire someone
[11:22:52] <cage> NoiseEee, No, I have to make it myself.
[11:22:55] <Sebastian> johnkpaul: I only want to call it if the ajax result has a certain result, if it signals valid data I want the form to proceed
[11:23:16] <cage> NoiseEee, I have no code it myself.
[11:23:25] <d3f4ultr0> johnkpaul, do you think we have a pdf version of this link, http://jqfundamentals.com
[11:23:26] <cage> Can you give some pointers?
[11:23:38] <johnkpaul> Sebastian: right, so there is no way to pause execution for this check, you need to always preventDefault() and then submit directly if your validation is successful

[11:25:48] <toddp> Hi all - I'm trying to test a new jquery countdown timer (for different time zones). could you please let me know what the bubbles read on this (days, hours, minutes, etc)? http://www.timelinefusion.com/countdown/
[11:25:57] <Sebastian> johnkpaul: I'd hoped it would be possible to use $.when().then() but it doesn't seem to work. preventingDefault and resubmitting is the only way to go?
[11:26:07] <jackp10> johnkpaul, thanks for your help… i have changed it to this:    \/.*\'    and it gets me:   /PORTAL/plugins/BASKETADMIN.php' including the apostrophe. How can i avoid to get it, considering that after the .php there could be some other parameters ?
[11:26:40] <jackp10> basically everything within the single quotes
[11:32:22] <Lundy> johnkpaul: http://lundy.me.uk/ - thats the source for the main index.php ... but for some reason its not long polling, maybe my PHP file isnt setup right?
[11:37:02] <newb> hello! somebody can suggest me a lightbox plugin who let me see the image at original size? There are prettyphoto ( www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/ ), but  the image size isn't the original image size
[11:51:19] <zerobeholder> any tips for googling this when you run into problems
[11:53:13] <zerobeholder> what I have is t = Object(this); and what I am trying to merge is the idea of var t = {}; and this -- var t = {this}; did not yield the results I am loking for but "this", {, and } are terrible search terms!
[11:53:35] <zerobeholder> Bah.
[11:54:39] <zerobeholder> I think of them as curly braces. Google thinks of them like second class citizens not worth talking about.
[11:55:06] <newb> solved :D
[11:57:14] <zerobeholder> crap, have to get out of dodge. I will try again later and pay more attention to coherent sentence structure. I am shaking my head looking at my own mess.
[12:06:24] <jeffsmykil_> Is there an easy way to add commas in the appropriate places in numbers after you append the integer into the dom
[12:06:59] <jeffsmykil_> some sort of jquery magic
[12:10:04] <johnkpaul> Sebastian: you can use deferreds, look into pipe
[12:18:32] <SmashingX> please guys I have an error on my jquery code that I can't solve: I have my code here: http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/29/ it works therre but when I add it to my server it says this: illegal character [Break On This Error]       });​
[12:20:19] <yjeroen> Hmm.. I remember seeing an annotation kind of effect on some websites.. Where a drawn arrow was pointing to a UI element with a text beside it, explaining the UI...
[12:20:27] <yjeroen> Cant remember where I saw it, or if it was a css or jquery thing. Anyone know something similar?
[12:20:54] <johnkpaul> yjeroen: tooltips
[12:21:23] <yjeroen> johnkpaul: Yes, but not like a normal "box" tooltip
[12:22:27] <johnkpaul> yjeroen: what do you mean
[12:22:33] <johnkpaul> http://cssarrowplease.com/
[12:23:51] <yjeroen> johnkpaul: Yes thats a normal box tooltip. What I mean is a drawn arrow pointing to a block (text/img/ui) with an explanation text besides it
[12:28:59] <SmashingX> please guys I have an error on my jquery code that I can't solve: I have my code here: http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/29/ it works therre but when I add it to my server it says this: illegal character [Break On This Error]       });​

[12:53:01] <QaDeS> is there a way to force jquery(mobile) to refresh the UI before resuming, for example after an element.text('foo') call?
[12:53:09] <QaDeS> i'm starting a synchronous ajax call right afterwards, and it causes the UI to freeze and not show the change
[12:53:16] <thansen> is it possible to change the 'document' of jquery so instead of the inherent page I can load a url via ajax and manipulate/query the returned dom?
[12:55:43] <QaDeS> thansen, $('<b>some html</b>) gives you a tree that you can operate on like on the document
[12:56:41] <thansen> so you would double up on the selector like...$('dom content').$('#id').val()
[12:56:48] <QaDeS> assign that to, for example, myvar and do myvar.find('#some_element').text('foobar')  and stuff like that
[12:57:08] <snowinferno> Hi all, is anybody familiar with the Uploadify plugin? I keep getting "Call to StartUpload failed" in my Firefox Error console, it works fine in Chrome and IE9 though
[12:59:03] <QaDeS> thansen, there's probably more than one way to do that. but generally i wouldn't try to replace window.document just to save some keystrokes
[12:59:11] <QaDeS> might break events and all kinds of other stuff
[12:59:22] <thansen> sounds scary yeah
[13:04:41] <oskbor> http://jsfiddle.net/oskbor/Wu2cu/1/ anyone has any ideas why the drop event would fire twice? and also why the ui variable (in the drop function) is undefined? (jqueryui 1.9 + emberjs integration question)
[13:10:06] <mazet> hello,, I have a form created using Razor syntax (ASP .NET MVC3), in this form I have two fields for dates that I don't want to validate, so I tried to ignore fields with "date" class : http://pastebin.com/XWDitmEs However it doesn't seem to work. Fields are still checked by jquery.validate plugin.
[13:21:38] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all. how hard would it be to make a plugin that explicitly positioned elements without modifying their existing position and display attributes....in other words, if you want to move an element 5 px to the left and it's absolutely positioned, do this...if it's relatively positioned...do this, etc. (but make it transparent to the user)
[13:25:37] <Whirl3d> I see, Nat Geo must be doing their special on topless native tribes cause no one is talking in this channel. Everyone must be focused on something besides me and my needs. Well fine. LOL
[13:26:29] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: i would say it would be like quartz or topaz
[13:26:48] <ajpiano> so a 7 or 8 on the moh scale of hardness
[13:27:19] <Whirl3d> hmm. Glad I didn't start down that path. Thanks for the reply.
[13:27:30] <ajpiano> i was just going for the moh joke
[13:27:36] <ajpiano> it might not be that hard
[13:27:47] <ajpiano> but it sounds like a not great idea
[13:29:18] <Whirl3d> All the other properties of an element can be affected using animate. But to change position requires so many conditions to keep track of
[13:30:27] <Whirl3d> I was thinking that it would be nice to animate x and y and the engine would determine if that meant left and top or left-margin top-margin or what have you
[13:30:46] <_coder7of9> i have $("select#teams").change(function(){ ... how do i programatically execute the onchange. document.getElementById().onchange appears to be nul
[13:30:59] <ajpiano> _coder7of9: $("#teams").change();
[13:31:01] <ajpiano> with no args
[13:31:03] <ajpiano> triggers hadlers
[13:31:05] <ajpiano> or ?trigger
[13:31:09] <ajpiano> ?trigger
[13:31:10] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[13:31:34] <_coder7of9> thanks
[13:31:48] <_coder7of9> regular js is easier than jquery.
[13:31:51] <_coder7of9> sometimes
[13:32:07] <Whirl3d> bite your tongue _coder7of9.. LOL
[13:32:31] <yedimind> hah
[13:32:34] <yedimind> he said sometimes
[13:32:35] <yedimind> :)
[13:32:41] <_coder7of9> ah trigger. so easy
[13:38:22] <SmashingX> please guys I have an error on my jquery code that I can't solve: I have my code here: http://jsfiddle.net/U6e5v/29/ it works therre but when I add it to my server it says this: illegal character [Break On This Error]       });​illegal character d()js_50d...17b8.js (line 16) c = Object { originalEvent=Event scroll, type="scroll", timeStamp=1336764567134, more...} d()
[13:39:34] <Whirl3d> this is a theory question that may be stupid: when you cache a reference to an element in a variable and then define event handlers on the element, within the definition o the event handler, is it better to use the variable name (since it's cached) or should you cache "this" inside the handler or does it matter really?
[13:39:54] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: i usually use the existing reference
[13:40:01] <ajpiano> if i *know* it's a static element
[13:40:14] <shoky_> me too^
[13:40:47] <Whirl3d> I just realized that it might be a good idea to do it that way, so I thought I'd ask. Thanks.
[13:42:44] <catcher> Hey guys, I have a bug somewhere in my jquery code that hangs my browser. I can't debug because my firebug console never gets a chance to act. How can I debug this?
[13:42:56] <catcher> can't look at the console*, I should say.
[13:43:43] <oskbor> catcher: have you tried other browsers?
[13:44:05] <catcher> oskbor, can't say I have, worth a shot
[13:44:16] <mazet> how could I select a particular submit button and not all submit buttons?
[13:44:37] <oskbor> chrome has a good debugger catcher
[13:44:40] <catcher> mazet, give it an ID, or use a selector
[13:44:56] <oskbor> http://jsfiddle.net/oskbor/Wu2cu/1/ anyone has any ideas why the drop event would fire twice? and also why the ui variable (in the drop function) is undefined?
[13:45:47] <catcher> oskbor, interesting, chrome didn't hang at all, just FF so far.
[13:45:57] <catcher> no errors either. Not helpful! :-P
[13:46:08] <oskbor> hehe, unlucky
[13:46:28] <mazet> catcher: indeed, ty :p
[13:47:17] <oskbor> catcher: you can set chrome to break on exceptions, even caught ones, that might help you
[13:47:43] <catcher> oskbor, also considering setting breakpoints in firebug and stepping through
[13:48:05] <oskbor> yep
[13:51:15] <QaDeS> is there a way to make jquery drein the event queue before resuming?
[13:52:34] <QaDeS> or at least explicitly trigger the next event in the queue?
[13:54:02] <Whirl3d> ?deQueue
[13:54:02] <bot-t> .dequeue([queueName]): Execute the next function on the queue for the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/dequeue/
[13:54:35] <Whirl3d> ?stop
[13:54:35] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[13:57:45] <QaDeS> so $('#foo').text('bar').dequeue() would basically return only after the text is visibly changed?
[13:58:02] <Whirl3d> no,
[13:58:12] <catcher> progress - using jquery 1.4.4 breaks my search in FF (but not chrome). jquery 1.3.2 works on both. Maybe it's a known bug.
[13:58:24] <Whirl3d> $("#foo").text("bar") returns immediately
[13:59:23] <Whirl3d> but $("#foo").fadeIn().fadeOut().fadeIn().fadeOut().fadeIn().deQueu() would remain in the fade out state
[13:59:37] <Whirl3d> I think...
[14:00:16] <QaDeS> but show() and hide() would work for that?
[14:01:35] <Whirl3d> wait, I just picked fadein and out cause they were easy to type to demonstrate the poitn that animation events are queued in the FX queue. Dequeue take off the last animation from the queue
[14:06:35] <QaDeS> ah ok
[14:06:59] <QaDeS> so if i wanted to call .show() on an element, and then wait until it's actually shown, what would i do?
[14:07:29] <QaDeS> and i mean i literally have to wait till it happened. no possibility to use callbacks whatsoever
[14:07:44] <Whirl3d> show takes a callback function
[14:07:55] <Whirl3d> so $(element).show(callback);
[14:08:10] <Whirl3d> where callback is called when the show animation is complete
[14:09:18] <riku9000> why is firefox returning the width of the window instead of the width of the document when $(document).width() is called?
[14:09:21] <riku9000> http://riku.kapsi.fi/testi.html
[14:09:33] <riku9000> chrome is returning the right width :s
[14:09:44] <QaDeS> as i said, no way to do this :(
[14:10:05] <QaDeS> or is there a way to show an element synchronously? without queuing an animation?
[14:10:52] <Whirl3d> riku9000 block level elements that wrap are defined to take up the entire width of their parent's. In your case, that's the document width
[14:11:27] <riku9000> well, how should I return the whole width of the document in firefox?
[14:11:50] <silverwind> riku9000, $(window).width(); ?
[14:12:14] <riku9000> i dont want to get the width of the window
[14:12:24] <riku9000> i need the width of the whole page
[14:13:00] <Whirl3d> try $.scrollWidth()  maybe?
[14:13:15] <riku9000> lets see..
[14:13:16] <Whirl3d> ?scrollWidth
[14:13:18] <bot-t> Whirl3d, #7542 (scrollWidth/scrollHeight function)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 7 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7542
[14:13:47] <Whirl3d> sorry, nvm Must've been a plugin
[14:13:55] <riku9000> :(
[14:14:00] <Whirl3d> try checking the body width()
[14:14:21] <riku9000> doesnt work either :s
[14:14:28] <riku9000> still returning the window width
[14:14:40] <riku9000> with chrome its working perfectly
[14:15:29] <Whirl3d> just as a test. put your text in a <p> element
[14:15:38] <riku9000> alright..
[14:15:56] <riku9000> nope :D
[14:16:06] <ngharo> riku9000: $(document).width()
[14:16:33] <riku9000> nope, it doesnt work
[14:16:39] <Whirl3d> that's what he has. It's not workinging
[14:16:44] <riku9000> :D
[14:16:45] <ngharo> wat
[14:16:47] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/Rq5Ya/
[14:17:05] <ngharo> oh, working on chrome only?
[14:17:10] <riku9000> yep
[14:17:31] <Whirl3d> and presumably with content>window.width();
[14:18:11] <ngharo> i get 5000 returned in FF

[14:18:17] <bot-t> http, Selectors - Each action we perform with jQuery requires a target; for example, in order to hide or show an element on the page, first we must find that element. To do so, we rely on jQuerys selector expression... http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/

[14:19:36] <riku9000> nope
[14:19:51] <riku9000> why does it work in jsfiddle :s
[14:20:22] <Whirl3d> iframe?

[15:06:57] <aphid> Logikos: i've always used simple_html_dom for stuff like that
[15:08:37] <Logikos> i'll take a look.. ty aphid....

[15:11:14] <Logikos> looking at the docs for it, i dont see how to do what i want with it either
[15:11:31] <Logikos> although i'm sure it can, i'm sure phpquery can too, its just the documentation sucks and i dont know how
[15:15:18] <aphid> in simple dom, you'd foreach($html->find('div') as $div) { echo $div->outertext; }   //(or innertext, or plaintext, or whatever you need)

[15:29:54] <ner0x> silverwind: Need to change the params I send.
[15:32:01] <silverwind> ner0x, ok, then just use location.reload() in the success callback
[15:32:13] <danzik171> ner0x: so just bind to the submit event and change whatever you want before the default action happens.  or what silverwind said.

[17:18:18] <rodrigovieira> hello everyone
[17:18:43] <rodrigovieira> I want to create a JavaScript function
[17:18:54] <rodrigovieira> to be used as a constructor
[17:19:08] <rodrigovieira> and I wanna know how do I return a value
[17:19:35] <rodrigovieira> for the instance of this function, right when it is created
[17:19:50] <rodrigovieira> i.e
[17:20:20] <rodrigovieira> function Person() {}

[17:20:45] <rodrigovieira> var me = new Person("Rodrigo");
[17:20:54] <rodrigovieira> me would return the given name
[17:21:13] <rodrigovieira> I know this is supposed to be a jQuery specific channel
[17:21:27] <rodrigovieira> but I could't find a JS general one
[17:21:34] <rodrigovieira> I appreciate any response ;)

[17:28:01] <rodrigovieira> oh
[17:29:11] <xec> but like ngharo demonstrated, you can have name as a property

[17:30:16] <Lyfesaver> needlesly to say
[17:30:20] <tw2113> it's slow?
[17:30:25] <Lyfesaver> i get the javascript continue or stop error
[17:30:45] <xec> i.e. dead slow
[17:31:01] <Lyfesaver> it can take about 6 seconds to load the page yes
[17:31:10] <ngharo> it puts out alright
[17:31:11] <Lyfesaver> and it acts like it locks up, but finially loads
[17:31:15] <Lyfesaver> anyway
[17:31:23] <Lyfesaver> the issue to get it fixed is sooooo specific and hard
[17:31:35] <Lyfesaver> i dont think i will ever be able to get the page to load right
[17:31:37] <ngharo> are you appending to the DOM many times?
[17:31:41] <Lyfesaver> it is WAY beyond my skills
[17:31:54] <Lyfesaver> so is there anyway to disable that eroror or make it take longer to kick in?
[17:32:05] <ngharo> no
[17:32:09] <xec> not that i know of, and it sounds like a bad idea
[17:32:10] <Lyfesaver> i am doing a whole bunch of stuff wrong
[17:32:27] <Lyfesaver> ya it is a bad idea for sure
[17:32:31] <Lyfesaver> kk
[17:32:34] <Lyfesaver> well it was worth a shot
[17:32:36] <Lyfesaver> =)
[17:33:19] <xec> but outputting "hundreds" of elements shouldn't take 6 seconds :P
[17:33:26] <Lyfesaver> if it was not an MVC project it would be much easier just to fix on the client side
[17:33:48] <xec> that doesn't make a lot of sense
[17:33:53] <Lyfesaver> no?
[17:34:13] <Lyfesaver> would you like to see it in action xec?
[17:34:15] <xec> mvc is just a pattern
[17:34:21] <Whirl3d> can someone explain .pipe() and perhaps help me with the syntax to apply it?
[17:34:57] <xec> Lyfesaver: do you mean asp.net mvc?
[17:35:03] <Lyfesaver> yes
[17:35:11] <Lyfesaver> razor C# syntax
[17:35:23] <xec> well, that doesn't have much to do with client speed at all
[17:35:37] <Lyfesaver> no, it doesn't
[17:35:43] <Lyfesaver> but access the model in a different way
[17:35:50] <Lyfesaver> would allow me to maybe paginate
[17:35:57] <Lyfesaver> or other things to wrok around it
[17:36:50] <Lyfesaver> and if i take out the JS ihave working with it
[17:36:53] <Lyfesaver> it is BLAZING fast
[17:37:13] <Lyfesaver> so i know it is all in the way i have it coded
[17:37:25] <Lyfesaver> but damned if i am able to work it out =)
[17:37:28] <Lyfesaver> lol
[17:37:37] <xec> well, then you have effectively ruled out the server as a bottleneck, right
[17:37:43] <Lyfesaver> yes
[17:37:45] <Lyfesaver> right
[17:37:49] <Lyfesaver> it is not the server
[17:38:00] <xec> wo what is your javascript doing
[17:38:10] <xec> so*
[17:38:15] <Lyfesaver> well in a nutshell
[17:38:25] <Lyfesaver> each item returned from the model
[17:38:33] <Lyfesaver> is wrapped in a div holding an image
[17:38:44] <Lyfesaver> plus 3 or four other divs for info
[17:39:04] <Lyfesaver> there is some HEAVY repititiion going on
[17:39:18] <Lyfesaver> the same divs for the info are exactly the same
[17:39:23] <Lyfesaver> just some text is different
[17:39:34] <Lyfesaver> so the issue is amking 700 divs when all i need is one
[17:39:41] <Lyfesaver> for the info
[17:40:05] <xec> why?
[17:40:20] <Lyfesaver> why what? why am i making 700 when 1 work?
[17:40:28] <Lyfesaver> cuz that is the only way I know
[17:40:32] <xec> why are you making 700 divs if you need 1
[17:40:36] <Lyfesaver> i am not good enough at JS to do it right
[17:40:46] <tw2113> so learn how to opimize
[17:40:49] <Lyfesaver> and those that are good with JS
[17:40:56] <Lyfesaver> that have been willing to help me
[17:41:07] <Lyfesaver> are not able to read the razor code that drives it all
[17:41:14] <Lyfesaver> so its a tricky spot
[17:41:15] <Lyfesaver> =)
[17:41:35] <xec> Lyfesaver: your statements so far have been very vague and general, so it's practically impossible to give you any constructive feedback
[17:41:42] <Lyfesaver> i know
[17:41:49] <Lyfesaver> i offered u to see it in action
[17:41:52] <Lyfesaver> maybe u did not see that
[17:41:53] <Lyfesaver> sry
[17:42:02] <xec> oh, do you have a live url?
[17:42:20] <Lyfesaver> yes, but it is acct controled so i nee dto private it to u
[17:42:21] <Lyfesaver> sec
[17:42:33] <tw2113> always have live code ready, especially with js
[17:42:37] <tw2113> frontend ftw
[17:44:11] <xec> Lyfesaver: you could either post the live url and login to channel, or if it is sensitive, make a demo
[17:44:33] <Lyfesaver> kk
[17:45:11] <Lyfesaver> well thx for trying i really do appreciate it =)
[17:47:47] <xec> Lyfesaver: from the link you sent me in PM it appears you're cramming all the info onto one page and then hiding it to show in modal window later. correct?
[17:48:00] <Lyfesaver> yup
[17:48:04] <Lyfesaver> and that is wrong
[17:48:05] <Lyfesaver> =)
[17:48:38] <Lyfesaver> its not modal i dont think, but yes that is the issue i am facing
[17:49:20] <Lyfesaver> http://paste2.org/p/2018956
[17:49:21] <xec> Lyfesaver: yes, what you could do is make a url that returns info about one movie (in mvc terms, a controller action that returns a partial view) and access that with ajax on click on one item
[17:49:44] <Lyfesaver> kk i will look into that
[17:49:47] <Lyfesaver> ty
[17:49:59] <xec> Lyfesaver: that way you can make the overview page much smaller and not need to hide all that stuff
[17:50:08] <Lyfesaver> yup
[17:50:24] <Lyfesaver> but that is all beyond me... I am just an HTML/CSS guy
[17:50:28] <Lyfesaver> so
[17:50:36] <Lyfesaver> but i will read up on adding the controller
[17:50:41] <Lyfesaver> i have added some others already
[17:50:53] <Lyfesaver> see if i can figure that one out
[17:51:40] <sviatovigt> how can I retrieve the class of a tag
[17:51:41] <sviatovigt> ?
[17:52:14] <xec> sviatovigt: there might be multiple
[17:52:34] <sviatovigt> can I do it with .css?
[17:52:38] <xec> sviatovigt: but you can get the class attribute just like any other with .attr("class")
[17:53:04] <xec> what are you trying to achieve with this, sviatovigt
[17:53:48] <sviatovigt> to make a conditional check depending on the class of that element
[17:53:50] <aphid> sviatovigt: $('selector').toggleClass('classname') ?
[17:54:06] <aphid> oh, retreive
[17:54:09] <aphid> nvm
[17:54:15] <aphid> i've been staring at the screen too long
[17:54:37] <xec> ?hasclass @ sviatovigt
[17:54:37] <bot-t> sviatovigt, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[17:56:20] <sviatovigt> thanks xec
[18:07:10] <mydog2> evening...
[18:09:24] <Whirl3d> If you have two asynchronous methods that write to an elements data object, how do you ensure that you aren't losing data?
[18:10:09] <danzik171> Whirl3d: they're happening concurrently?
[18:10:20] <Whirl3d> shouldn't be, but could be.
[18:10:43] <Whirl3d> I am loading an image into a div (whose data object identifies the url of the image)
[18:11:02] <Whirl3d> and while it is loading, I'm doing other things to the parent div (getting it decorated)
[18:11:15] <danzik171> Whirl3d: considering that JS is on a single thread, you should be able to reason about what happens when one success callback happens after another
[18:12:31] <Whirl3d> But doesn't data automatically extend itself?
[18:13:14] <danzik171> what do you mean automatically?  as in .data() automatically reading data- attributes?
[18:13:23] <Whirl3d> In other words $("el").data({this:"stuf"}).data({that:stuff}); console.log($(el).data()) would give {this:stuf, that:stuff}
[18:14:33] <danzik171> the data object is just that, an object...there's nothing really magical about it
[18:14:44] <Whirl3d> whereas traditionally, you would expect $(el).data(oneobject).data(newobject) to just contain the new object, now it contains the two combined objects
[18:15:06] <Whirl3d> sure I guess I meant the data method
[18:15:47] <bung> is there any noteable downside to using $(function(){...}); instead of $(document).ready(function(){...}); ?
[18:15:59] <danzik171> bung: no, they're identical
[18:16:39] <bung> and is it better pratice to do jQuery(function(){ var $ = jQuery; ... });
[18:16:52] <danzik171> Whirl3d: behind the scenes, data is literally just setting values on an object.  when you pass an object like you're doing, it's just a map of key/values to set
[18:17:01] <bung> I guess I should still have a jQuery check before that?
[18:17:17] <bung> typeof != 'undefined' ?
[18:17:40] <Whirl3d> danzik171, Ill make a fiddle. I think you are missing the magic of the data method, but I could be wrong. Let me check and I'll post back either way.
[18:18:54] <danzik171> bung: dunno, is it possible for reasonable or jQuery to be undefined in your situation?  and you can just do jQuery(function($){  })
[18:20:09] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Rq5Ya/24/
[18:20:12] <bung> oh really? cool
[18:20:21] <bung> so it passes itself in as "this'
[18:20:23] <bung> ?
[18:22:12] <danzik171> bung: no, it's not 'this', it's an argument to the function you passed to jQuery.    http://api.jquery.com/ready
[18:22:38] <bung> ah ok thanks i was just about to ask where i can read about that
[18:23:19] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Rq5Ya/25/
[18:23:58] <Whirl3d> in that example, oldData is how you would expect a standard object to work. but $.data actually extends the data object every time, I believe
[18:25:31] <danzik171> Whirl3d: right, that's what it says in the docs.  still not seeing what's magic =P
[18:26:54] <Whirl3d> so, I was trying to figure out if I am accessing the parts asynchromously, is it a problem. When I realized that I am using only part one attribute of the data object to store my configurations.THat's why they are being overwritten. it doesn't do a deep extend.
[18:28:21] <danzik171> the asynchronous part doesn't have much to do with it - two pieces of code will never hit this block at the same time since javascript is single-threaded.  what happens if/when a call happens say 30 seconds later?  do you lose data then?
[18:29:36] <danzik171> Whirl3d: if you really want a deep copy, you can just do something like $.extend( true, div.data(), someOtherData )
[18:29:53] <Whirl3d> here's a better example of my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/Rq5Ya/27/
[18:30:28] <Whirl3d> notice that I am updating the fruit attribute. I want to extend the fruit attribute (in two different places in my code), not overwrite it
[18:30:55] <Whirl3d> I was expecting to see 4 attributes of the "fruit" attribute..
[18:32:09] <danzik171> Whirl3d: it would be 3 attributes, you're overwriting the "grapes" attribute in your second object.  but i'm saying that whether the calls happen concurrently or they happen 30 minutes apart, this behavior will still occur - it has nothing to do with being async
[18:32:38] <danzik171> its more about the behavior of "data" that you're asking about it sounds like
[18:33:30] <Whirl3d> Okay. I am just not sure when/if i am going to do it becuase, for one thing, the chance that it will happen occurs only on the success/error callbacks for a load event
[18:34:33] <Whirl3d> So the logic involved in checking the state of the data object every time I write to it is counterproductive. Instead, I should find amother way to do it when possibly updating the configuration attribute in my load callbacks
[18:35:11] <Whirl3d> good catch with the 3 attributes. LOL
[18:36:03] <Whirl3d> I can see where that is not necessarily an issue with the async/not async.... it 's just in my case the chances that it will happen only occur in the async parts of my code.
[18:39:33] <Whirl3d> Ooops. my $.fn.deepData() method messed up. LOL http://jsfiddle.net/Rq5Ya/31/
[18:41:56] <Whirl3d> better...http://jsfiddle.net/Rq5Ya/33/
[18:44:26] <Iarfen> Hi!!
[18:44:46] <Iarfen> How I can add text to a textarea?? (new text without replacing the existings text)
[18:45:08] <Whirl3d> danzik171, thanks for your help. my new $.deepData works just the way I need it to thanks to your suggestion. 8)
[18:45:40] <danzik171> Whirl3d: np.  btw http://jsfiddle.net/Rq5Ya/34/
[18:47:08] <Whirl3d> larfen,  $("textarea").text($("textarea").text()+"new text");  but "textarea" needs to be a single selector or you will add the text to all the textarea elements' text
[18:49:16] <Iarfen> Whirl3d: ok ty

[19:00:13] <ghost[]> layin in bed sippin perrier
[19:05:29] <bartmax_> stupid and easy question: I have an array of input elements, how can i get the values of that inputs as an array ? $('input') <-- array of input, $('input').val() <-- only last value
[19:06:59] <systemfault> bartmax_: $('input').map(function() { return this.value; }); //should work...
[19:07:12] <bartmax_> systemfault: thanks, always forget about map

[19:16:05] <Tordek> hi
[19:17:26] <shoky> hy
[19:21:12] <Heshanh> hi, im trying to insert a date into a text box when a button is clicked with jquery UI. i got the button the pop the date picker and insert the date as well. but how do i stop the datpicker from poping up when someone clicks the text field
[19:22:12] <bartmax_> Heshanh: think you need to destroy datepicker...
[19:23:44] <Heshanh> but that would stop the datepick from poping up ?
[19:24:07] <Heshanh> or is there way to insert a date to a textbox without initialzing datepicker on that textbox
[19:34:13] <IvanBliminse> Does anyone know how to map more than one event handler to the following bit of jquery?  $(document).on("click",".someClass",function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); }); ?? i want to add mouseenter to that as well and the jquery site only has a map if your not using (document)
[19:56:16] <Whirl3d> with deferred.resolveWith(someElement);   if you register a callback using .done(function (el) {  stuff.....will the argument passed to the callback be the element resolvedWith or will the function be run in the scope of the element resolvedWith...?
[19:59:21] <Whirl3d> answer: the callback is resolved in the context of the resolvedWith target.
[20:02:16] <bartmax_> why this a illegal invocation? : $.post('/Expedition/SetRouteLote', { lote_id: lote_id, id_items: ids });
[20:02:31] <bartmax_> lote_id = 1, ids = [1,2,3]
[20:05:17] <fezziwig> Hello!  This is my first time here... I am wondering, is there any way to use jQuery to add/remove classes from a div in ANOTHER frame?
[20:05:32] <tw2113> eww frames
[20:05:49] <fezziwig> yeah
[20:06:00] <fezziwig> tw2113, do I know you from the WordPress channel?
[20:06:06] <tw2113> most likely
[20:06:24] <fezziwig> anyway, yes, eww frames - they're iFrames
[20:07:17] <fezziwig> Does jQuery allow for such communication?
[20:10:03] <fezziwig> tw2113, do you know if it is possible?
[20:11:19] <tw2113> *shrug*
[20:11:25] <tw2113> i avoid frames of all sorts when i can
[20:12:04] <fezziwig> suffice it to say you don't know
[20:12:42] <ajpiano> fezziwig: are the frames on the same domain
[20:12:46] <fezziwig> yes
[20:12:49] <ajpiano> reat
[20:12:50] <ajpiano> great*
[20:13:14] <ajpiano> fezziwig: $("#someIframe").contents().find(".stuff").removeClass("whatever")
[20:13:51] <tw2113> i don't know a lot of things
[20:13:58] <Dr-Bombay> never quite understood the aversion to frames, most of it from people who didn't care about disabled accesibility
[20:13:58] <tw2113> don't believe what the people in #wordpress say
[20:14:42] <Dr-Bombay> it came from netscape though at a time when a lot of bad ideas were coming from them
[20:14:43] <fezziwig> ajpiano, is there a way to reference the "parent" though? This is one iframe trying to talk to another iframe
[20:14:49] <Dr-Bombay> maybe people just acted on reflex
[20:14:58] <ajpiano> fezziwig: 'top'
[20:15:08] <ajpiano> fezziwig: top will always be a reference to the topmost window object
[20:15:38] <fezziwig> ajpiano - so where does "top" go in that syntax?
[20:15:41] <ajpiano> so you can do $("foo", top.document) to use jquery in the iframe to select from the parent
[20:15:56] <ajpiano> you can do top.jQuery("foo") to use the jquery from the parent window from the iframe, etc
[20:16:16] <ajpiano> i'm not sure what else you mean by reference the "parent"
[20:16:46] <fezziwig> ajpiano so... top.jQuery("#someIframe").contents().find(".stuff").removeClass("whatever")
[20:17:05] * tw2113 tinkers with sublime text
[20:17:07] <ajpiano> you don't necessarily have to use top, i have no idea what your page setup is exactly
[20:17:21] <fezziwig> ajpiano - top would be fine
[20:17:31] <fezziwig> I just need to figure out the syntax
[20:17:48] <ajpiano> so you are in one iframe and you want to go up to the parent document, find a different iframe, and manipulate the class of an element inside of it?
[20:17:53] <fezziwig> yes
[20:18:01] <ajpiano> that should do the trick then
[20:18:08] <fezziwig> top.jQuery("#someIframe").contents().find(".stuff").removeClass("whatever")
[20:18:10] <fezziwig> ?
[20:18:16] <ajpiano> yep
[20:18:21] <ajpiano> ?contents
[20:18:21] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[20:18:32] <ajpiano> works on iframe to get the window
[20:18:39] <tw2113> woo chaining
[20:18:57] <ajpiano> fezziwig: iframe.contentWindow is what you're getting with contents
[20:19:05] <ajpiano> just... fyi
[20:19:05] <ajpiano> :)
[20:19:28] <fezziwig> I don't understand
[20:19:56] <ajpiano> i'm just saying that iframe elements have a property called contentWindow... which is the window object of the iframe
[20:20:04] <fezziwig> oh, ok
[20:20:34] <ajpiano> alright i gotta roll best of luck
[20:21:47] <fezziwig> ajpiano thanks!
[20:21:48] <tw2113> who thinks i should get to work finally?
[20:21:53] <bartmax_> hey, how the ... do i pass object via ajax ? must be the flu...
[20:22:15] <bartmax_> why this a illegal invocation? : $.post('/Expedition/SetRouteLote', { lote_id: lote_id, id_items: ids });
[20:22:18] <bartmax_> lote_id = 1, ids = [1,2,3]
[20:22:36] <bartmax_> if i do $.param({lote_id: 1, ids : [1,2,3]}); works perfectly
[20:22:58] <bartmax_> if i do data = {lote_id: 1, ids : [1,2,3]}); $.param(data) invalid invocation
[20:35:17] <bartmax_> please HELP!
[20:38:51] <Whirl3d> jc, bartmax_, it looks like you got an extra } on you line with data=
[20:39:05] <Whirl3d> extra }), really
[20:39:10] <bartmax_> Whirl3d: that's typing issue
[20:39:24] <Whirl3d> I have an idea, why not create a fiddle?
[20:39:38] <bartmax_> ok easy
[20:41:04] <Whirl3d> try, adding , true after your data in $.param
[20:42:08] <bartmax_> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/RW7qE/
[20:42:10] <bartmax_> in fiddle works
[20:42:13] <bartmax_> :(
[20:43:25] <Whirl3d> that's different than $.param(data);
[20:43:51] <alexi5> gg'
[20:43:56] <bartmax_> Whirl3d: now doesnt: http://jsfiddle.net/RW7qE/1/
[20:44:03] <bartmax_> and i dont know why
[20:45:49] <Whirl3d> bartmax_, the second one works for me, the first didn't
[20:45:59] <bartmax_> i updated, with console.log
[20:46:00] <bartmax_> http://jsfiddle.net/RW7qE/2/
[20:46:10] <bartmax_> and you see a invalid invocation on jsconsole
[20:46:27] <bartmax_> didnt work Whirl3d, it throws an invalid invocation
[20:46:44] <Whirl3d> I see a maximum call stack size exceeded
[20:46:49] <bartmax_> ????????
[20:47:19] <bartmax_> my console(chrome): Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation
[20:47:43] <bartmax_> 1054 ["6618", "6488", "7830"]
[20:47:43] <bartmax_> jquery.min.js:4Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation
[20:47:49] <bartmax_> the full console output
[20:49:12] <bartmax_> if I paste the ["6618", "6488", "7830"] into the variable it works!! its making me crazy
[20:49:21] <bartmax_> what kind of object map returns ?
[20:49:25] <bartmax_> can i convert to an array?
[20:49:37] <bartmax_> ? map
[20:49:37] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[20:50:00] <Whirl3d> maybe you need to parseInt somewhere
[20:50:35] <bartmax_> that was the problem. map
[20:50:38] <bartmax_> .get() at the end
[20:50:40] <bartmax_> solves it
[20:50:47] <bartmax_> fu....
[20:50:52] <bartmax_> thanks Whirl3d
[20:50:58] <bartmax_> let me try this on real server
[20:53:22] <bartmax_> yeah... at least!! 1 hours and a half dealing with that simple ajax
[20:53:23] <bartmax_> call
[21:13:09] <Whirl3d> Why would .on fire for elements that I didn't select for:  $(parent).on("click", childitems, function (e) {console.log($(e.target));})    doesn't give a child item. It gives the image inside a child item?
[21:14:53] <Whirl3d> I'm quickly getting to the point that I don't trust .on with selectors in the handler declaration
[21:19:44] <Zach1> Can somone tell me how to fix the problem where when i use .val("someIndex") on a select, it does not update until i click on the page?  I would really appreciate it
[21:20:38] <Whirl3d> fiddle?
[21:22:51] <shoky> Whirl3d: The target property can be the element that registered for the event or a descendant of it.
[21:28:17] <shoky> Whirl3d: so you're looking for event.currentTarget, or 'this'
[21:28:36] <shoky> (see http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/E7UTK/ )
[22:05:50] <IvanBliminse> anyone know if jquery can delete/remove an element off of the page? I need it to be compeltely gone rather than just hidden
[22:06:16] <StevenCodes22> ivan append() and remove()
[22:06:28] <IvanBliminse> lol that simple?
[22:06:35] <StevenCodes22> yup yup :)
[22:07:26] <IvanBliminse> thank you...
[22:08:53] <IvanBliminse> anyone know of a good way to make an element unclickable without having to put a clear/opaque element over top of it?
[22:09:26] <Dr-Bombay> give it a click handler that eats the event?
[22:09:29] <devinceartas> Disable it?
[22:10:00] <IvanBliminse> how would you disable it?
[22:11:25] <devinceartas> Disabled is an attribute which can be set/ unset on some elements like buttons
[22:12:12] <IvanBliminse> and you can do that for all elements & deceendants?
[22:13:03] <IvanBliminse> Dr-Bombay, I tried to do that with e.stopPropagation but things are still clickable
[22:13:13] <Dr-Bombay> disabled applies only to form controls
[22:13:18] <devinceartas> I don't think it's valid for all elements, but not sure what all browsers do
[22:13:43] <Dr-Bombay> (in HTML 4)
[22:14:11] <devinceartas> That sounds correct
[22:14:36] <Dr-Bombay> ivan: if you want to disable all elements in a subtree then you will probably have to attach the event throughout the subtree
[22:14:59] <Dr-Bombay> overlaying the element seems like a simpler option IMO
[22:15:29] <IvanBliminse> basically what I'm trying to do is keep the user from clicking other things while ajax is working.. currently i'm toggling an element and a generic loading <span>
[22:15:46] <Dr-Bombay> specific other things, or all things?
[22:16:07] <IvanBliminse> Dr-Bombay if you have a general area to cover it is simpler, but if you are trying to cover parts of the screen then it gets ugly..
[22:16:08] <IvanBliminse> both
[22:16:30] <devinceartas> Having a "loading" GIF covering page is pretty common
[22:17:22] <Dr-Bombay> ivanbliminse: one approach I've seen, instead of an overlay, is a flag that you set and your other handlers have to check it
[22:17:23] <IvanBliminse> true.. i may go that route instead of all these little loading spans running around
[22:17:52] <Dr-Bombay> but that's not much different structurally from attaching null event handlers
[22:17:53] <IvanBliminse> Dr-Bombay: that's a good idea...
[22:18:24] <IvanBliminse> I appreciate all the options guys.. where we you all when I had hard questions lol
[22:18:35] <devinceartas> Dr-Bombay: that works -- but gets tricky with asynchronous calls setting & insetting it
[22:19:08] <Dr-Bombay> well, that has to be thought through of course
[22:19:28] <IvanBliminse> I suppose i'll just do a full page loading div I toggle when someone is doing something and leave it at that..
[22:19:30] <Dr-Bombay> and the same issues have to be thought through with null event handlers too
[22:20:06] <devinceartas> I'm still learning to think in a way that accounts for asynchronous events
[22:21:20] <IvanBliminse> anyone know off of the top of thier had what the function for determining if a javascript array is empty is?
[22:21:52] <devinceartas> Array.length == 0 ?
[22:22:35] <IvanBliminse> thanks
[22:24:00] <Defrothew> Hello. Can anyone please help me. Does anyone know how to url encode search keywords in jquery?
[22:25:13] <IvanBliminse> Defrothew: how do you mean.. like.. ?key=value..?
[22:26:37] <devinceartas> Defrothew: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/332872/how-to-encode-a-url-in-javascript
[22:27:02] <devinceartas> Native js: no need for jquery there
[22:27:38] <Defrothew> Sorry, to add more info, "keyword here" = "keyword+here"
[22:28:03] <r3za> hi , i have a vertical list , and in li tag i put an a with display none attribute , so when i li hover did i want to show a tag with effect , i wrote this 			$(atag).css("display","block").fadeIn("slow"); but effect dosent work , what should i do ?
[22:28:26] <Defrothew> @IvanBliminse Yep.
[22:29:03] <IvanBliminse> Defrothew: devinceartas linked you something, see if thats it
[22:29:04] <Dr-Bombay> r3za: that's a rather complex question, you probably should post a demo on jsfiddle
[22:29:12] <Defrothew> @devinceartas Thanks for this. I was looking for something like"keyword here" converts it to a search string "keyword+here".
[22:29:28] <r3za> ok
[22:29:35] <r3za> Dr-Bombay: ok wait
[22:29:38] <devinceartas> escape() will not encode: @*/+  encodeURI() will not encode: ~!@#$&*()=:/,;?+'  encodeURIComponent() will not encode: ~!*()'
[22:30:02] <IvanBliminse> Defrothew: what are you wanting to do with it once it's there?
[22:30:14] <Defrothew> @devinceartas I see. Thanks. Sorry about that, still new to js stuff. :D
[22:30:18] <devinceartas> So you want the later I guess
[22:30:38] <Defrothew> @IvanBliminse Something like http://localhost/?search=keyword+here
[22:30:42] <Sazpaimon_> How would I go about moving all elements of .classname to their closest parent div
[22:30:49] <Sazpaimon_> would I need to use .each?
[22:31:01] <blyrrh> Hey, bit new to JS/jQuery and I'm confused about a language feature. In the examples on http://docs.jquery.com/Getjson it seems like the [data] parameter can be skipped and replaced right away with the callback. Why does a null parameter not have to be passed in between the url and callback?
[22:31:50] <IvanBliminse> Sazpaimon: sounds like it.. and probably .parent()
[22:35:36] <blyrrh> Any thoughts?
[22:38:17] <Dr-Bombay> blyrrh: an argument can be tested as to whether it is a function object or not
[22:38:18] <devinceartas> blyrrh: several jquery functions are confusing that way; I think it's because the code can tell the difference between an object and a function
[22:38:27] <Dr-Bombay> it would make no sense to send a function as data because it can't be encoded
[22:38:36] <Dr-Bombay> so there is no ambiguity
[22:39:07] <devinceartas> ( to the parser, though often for the programmer)
[22:40:53] <blyrrh> Gotchya. Thanks, I think I have to just get used to playing a little bit more fast and loose with my code now that i'm in JS lol
[22:42:41] <blyrrh> I've noticed that with a lot of the string parameters too. Like the enumeration for cursor type doesn't seem to be documented in jQuery, had to look to at css
[22:43:15] <Dr-Bombay> devince: the resolution happens at runtime
[22:44:01] <r3za> Dr-Bombay: http://jsfiddle.net/marandi/92tqP/1/
[22:46:14] <r3za> Dr-Bombay: its a vertical menu
[22:47:18] <r3za> Dr-Bombay: did u check it ?
[22:49:17] <Dr-Bombay> yeah, I don't know. maybe someone else will
[22:49:22] <r3za> guys i want to add effect when a tag display attribute gonna be block , but it dosent work : http://jsfiddle.net/marandi/92tqP/1/
[22:50:02] <sa2304> Hello,
[22:50:02] <sa2304> I write a simple plugin that converts <img> to a "desktop icon", by replacing it to $("<div><div><img></div><div>TITLE</div></div>").addClass('desktop-icon'); (wrapper+image+title).
[22:50:02] <sa2304> I want to keep my desktopIcon method chainable, but returning $(this).each(...) is not what I want because I replace <img> tags with a new content. I think the solution is to create a new jQuery collection appending all new icons to it and then return it. So I tried the following:
[22:50:02] <sa2304> /-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[22:50:06] <sa2304> $retstack = $([]);
[22:50:08] <sa2304> $(this).each(function() {
[22:50:10] <sa2304>   $img = $(this);
[22:50:11] <Dr-Bombay> sa2304: no
[22:50:12] <sa2304>   // some code here ...
[22:50:14] <sa2304>   $icon = $("<div><div><img></div><div>TITLE</div></div>");
[22:50:16] <sa2304>   $img.replaceWith($icon);
[22:50:18] <sa2304>   $retstack.add($icon);
[22:50:20] <sa2304> });
[22:50:22] <sa2304> return $retstack;
[22:50:24] <sa2304> /-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[22:50:26] <sa2304> But $retstack.size() still returns 0 after it.
[22:50:28] <sa2304> Can anyone tell what's going wrong?..
[22:51:44] <Whirl3d> ?fiddle@sa2304
[22:51:46] <bot-t> sa2304, #10785 (jQuery .html().replace breaks in IE7-8 only. Example fiddle ... - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10785
[22:51:51] <Whirl3d> grrr
[22:52:15] <Whirl3d> rather than polute the chanel with your code, please post it to jsfiddle.net, sa2304
[22:52:40] <sa2304> ok, I'll remember it
[22:52:59] <sa2304> thanks for the link
[22:54:03] <Whirl3d> sorry the link is http://jsfiddle.net   it appears that bot-t is acting up or that I am retarded...most likely the second
[23:13:50] <r3za> guys i want to add effect when a tag display attribute gonna be block , but it dosent work : http://jsfiddle.net/marandi/92tqP/1/
[23:35:09] <Whirl3d> atag=$(this).children(this)
[23:35:10] <Whirl3d> ?
[23:35:52] <r3za> hey guys why delay dosent work in this line : $(this).css({ "background-position": newvalue }).delay(200);
[23:36:03] <Whirl3d> what is atag?
[23:36:49] <Whirl3d> delay(200) probably delays 200 ms and then...there's nothing more to do
[23:38:41] <Whirl3d> what is tag? Is that html5?
[23:39:10] <tw2113> no idea, looks like it's a variable to me
[23:39:22] <tw2113> not an html tag
[23:39:58] <Whirl3d> r3za, what are you trying to do?
[23:40:52] <Whirl3d> troll much?
[23:41:10] <tw2113> what trolling?
[23:41:24] <r3za> Whirl3d: i change background position on hover event , now i want to change it back to default position with 200 delay but it dosent work well , i try this too : $(this).animate({backgroundPosition: newvalue},200)
[23:42:07] <Whirl3d> can you animate bg position? I thought that was one of the problems with jquery and animate. that it didn't allow you to animate the bg position...
[23:42:30] <Whirl3d> you put the delay before your animate function
[23:42:32] <r3za> Whirl3d: yea we can : http://www.protofunc.com/scripts/jquery/backgroundPosition/
[23:43:21] <r3za> Whirl3d: what ? i but what before what ?
[23:43:21] <coldhead> you can with a plugin
[23:43:33] <Whirl3d> well it looks like you need to add that plugin, first of all
[23:44:13] <Whirl3d> oh, hey  coldhead!
[23:44:21] <r3za> Whirl3d: i did
[23:45:20] <Whirl3d> I didn't see it in the fiddle. You have to click ADD RESOURCES and add it there, i believe
[23:45:53] <coldhead> animating background positions makes you very tired
[23:45:58] <Whirl3d> and in the html, you should only have the body content (not even the body tag) jsfiddle will do the rest
[23:46:02] <coldhead> just tell your client it can't be done and get a beer
[23:46:28] <huntedmitch> That's how I do it
[23:46:37] <huntedmitch> "It's impossible" is my go to move
[23:46:58] <Whirl3d> keep it up. That's how I get most of my clients. LOL
[23:47:13] <huntedmitch> happy to be keeping you in busines
[23:47:15] <huntedmitch> *business
[23:47:16] <huntedmitch> lol
[23:47:21] <systemfault> Whirl3d: I'd be surprised.
[23:47:33] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Most clients are clueless about what you can and cannot do.
[23:48:01] <Whirl3d> Sure. So when they are told they can't do something, they come to me and I tell them the same thing in a different way. 8)
[23:48:08] <tw2113> the clients i hate are the ones who see a shiney and call it necessary
[23:48:11] <Whirl3d> for some reason they love to hear it from me.
[23:48:27] <tw2113> and usually the shiney is from some product/company with many months and people behind it
[23:48:28] <systemfault> Whirl3d: BS :)
[23:48:45] <Whirl3d> I hate 90% of my clients that come to me and say, I need this and that and ...no I don't have any content.
[23:49:01] <tw2113> you need better clients
[23:49:05] <Whirl3d> tell me
[23:49:09] <Whirl3d> lawyers suck
[23:49:23] <tw2113> or you need to create a profitable product and you can ditch client work
[23:49:27] <tw2113> go work at google or something
[23:50:08] <systemfault> If you're professional with your client, they'll just believe you the day you'll say that something is impossible.
[23:50:24] <systemfault> Of course.. you cannot always use that card.
[23:50:27] <Whirl3d> But what _IS_ impossible, really?
[23:50:55] <Whirl3d> if ANYONE has ever done it before, they will be like: How'd THEY do it?
[23:51:09] <systemfault> Whirl3d: The latest "impossible" thing I had to do is to make drag & drop files in IE8
[23:51:32] <Whirl3d> tw2113, I don't have to work. I just do it to learn and to have something to do, really.
[23:51:54] <Whirl3d> What do you mean, dropbox does it?
[23:51:55] * tw2113 asks systemfault to create his own pinterest ripoff
[23:52:26] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Flash I guess..
[23:52:49] <Whirl3d> Yeah. And now that Flash 6 compiles to HTML5, it's gonna get weird.
[23:54:00] <systemfault> Real flash will probably stay for a long time...
[23:54:08] <Whirl3d> I wish I had a mac and the skill to write ipad apps. I have the single best ipad app idea ever.
[23:54:08] <systemfault> Because of video players.
[23:54:19] <Whirl3d> naw
[23:54:24] <Whirl3d> html5 videeo
[23:54:40] <Whirl3d> already replacing flash video at an alarming rate.
[23:54:41] <systemfault> Companies want live streaming… DRMs… etc.
[23:55:04] <Whirl3d> again, html5 will be able to handle it AND it will work on iphone/ipad,etc.
[23:55:11] <systemfault> If html5 video cannot do it.. a lot of companies are going to stay with flash
[23:55:40] <Whirl3d> about 15/20 last clients have been converts from Flash to HTML5 for ipad compat
[23:56:05] <systemfault> Whirl3d: What I often see is more like: Use flash everywhere but on i*
[23:56:21] <sa2304> I found the way to easily return a new jQuery collection using $.map . And when I return the collection it's not work in a chain. Here is a link : http://jsfiddle.net/LRfsn/ . Why after it addClass only has effect inside of an each() call, not at jQuery collection itself?..
[23:56:36] <Whirl3d> that's cause most people don't realize that you can do just about everything that flash does in javascript or natively in html5
[23:56:53] <Whirl3d> map returns an array
[23:56:55] <coldhead> we should write a pinterest plugin that turns any site into pinterest and use it everywhere so people get sick of it and stop asking for everything to look like pinterest pinterest pinterest
[23:57:06] <coldhead> i miss the days when it was facebook facebook facebook
[23:57:32] <systemfault> I don't care about facebook… and pinterest doesn't pinterests me.
[23:57:36] <tw2113> coldhead i'm irritated by share buttons these days
[23:58:02] <coldhead> VIRAL ALL THE THINGS!!!!@#!@
[23:58:15] <systemfault> Ur mom is viral!!111one.
[23:58:20] <systemfault> :/
[23:58:21] <coldhead> every page needs to be 90% share buttons
[23:58:37] <coldhead> you should have to click every single share button before you get to any content
[23:58:47] <sa2304> but jquery API tell that: .map( callback(index, domElement) ) Returns: jQuery
[23:58:52] <coldhead> and the content is a screenshot of a facebook status
[23:59:10] <Whirl3d> where?
[23:59:21] <coldhead> ?map
[23:59:22] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[23:59:58] <Whirl3d> wow. bot-t error
