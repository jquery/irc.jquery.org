[00:00:57] <mazzachre> coldhead: Problem is, the data I wish to fetch are individual service calls to a mainframe... Used by thousands, each page can include hundreds of elements...
[00:01:43] <mazzachre> The elements themselves are not too big etc. But the overhead on each call would "kill" the mainframe (slow it down to a crawl)
[00:05:19] <coldhead> could you "lazy" load the tooltips in the background on page load?
[00:05:22] <coldhead> a few at a time?
[00:05:46] <coldhead> optionally with some kind of priority handling for when the mouse gets "near" a relevant entry?
[00:08:04] <mattyh88> hey, i'm getting the error "cannot set property count of undefined" for my tablesorter. any clues why i'm getting that please?
[00:08:07] <coldhead> fill your pockets with the dust of the memories / that rises from the shoes on my feet
[00:08:42] <coldhead> something like this is happening, mattyh88: var x = undefined; x.count = 7;
[00:08:54] <coldhead> whatever you're trying to set count on is undefined
[00:09:06] <coldhead> the debugger might help you find out what/why
[00:09:41] <mattyh88> something with tablesorter, i'll google it :p
[00:13:27] <mazzachre> coldhead: Usual behaviour is that users only wants a few of these shown... So fetching everything is just wasting mainframe time... I still think the best way is fetch on demand here... And I probably need to find out which way to handle showing and stuff...
[00:13:46] <mazzachre> coldhead: thanks for the help anyway :D I have thought a bti by trying to explain, always helps
[00:14:15] <coldhead> animated spinner gif, mazzachre
[00:15:28] <mazzachre> coldhead: Hmm, ya, that might be an idea :)
[00:15:49] <coldhead> better and worse men than you have relied on them
[00:17:30] <mazzachre> Ya, even apple uses them :) And some of the bosses (and designers) here hold them as religion on UI design...
[00:32:53] <coldhead> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object DOMWindow] has no method 'add_box'
[00:34:00] <`paul> i have a script that parses each row of a table and visits a cell that contains a link thru ($.get) and sends data to a server problem is when visiting link its async whats the best approach in checking if all request is done.
[00:36:05] <coldhead> `paul: you might like to use one of the ajax queue plugins
[00:36:06] <b-ot> coldhead, Check out: http://scripteka.com and http://livepipe.net
[00:36:15] <coldhead> thanks b-ot
[00:36:32] <coldhead> `paul: that wil you you a nice array of live calls
[00:36:48] <coldhead> OR you can use promises to run some clean up code when all the requests are finished
[00:36:59] <`paul> my problem is its properly working if i set ajax to async: false;
[00:37:19] <coldhead> because then it's not async
[00:37:27] <coldhead> are you trying to make a call when the use clicks on a link?
[00:37:28] <`paul> but its an existing code and i just need to tweak it
[00:37:38] <`paul> no its a chrome extension :)
[00:37:44] <`paul> to parse a site
[00:38:51] <`paul> so what happens is dataarray[] -> parse table -> visit link (ajax) ->. put data in data array -> send to server
[00:39:09] <`paul> problem is if its async it passes data to server without the data from ajax
[00:40:05] <coldhead> i still think you want to use promises, if you want things to happen only when other things finish happening
[00:40:14] <coldhead> but i'd need to see the code to get a proper grasp of the problem
[00:45:55] <Godot> Hello! Whats the "jquery way" for element.getElementsByTagName("a")?
[00:46:01] <mazzachre> Anyone ever tried what happens if you call $(something).warp(undefined); ?
[00:46:22] <mazzachre> Godot: Have you ever read the documentation? $('a')
[00:47:45] <Mannimarco> hi
[00:47:48] <Godot> mazzachre: Have you ever read a question? Do you know theres a difference between document and element?
[00:47:57] <Mannimarco> what is the best way to store 100000000000000000000 objects in memory?
[00:48:04] <Mannimarco> objects represent neurons
[00:48:18] <Mannimarco> axons etc
[00:48:26] <Mannimarco> is there a way?
[00:48:38] <Mannimarco> Godot: document is element
[00:48:39] <mazzachre> Godot: $(element).find('a') then... It is still in the documentation... try "Traversing"
[00:49:20] <mazzachre> Mannimarco: Do not use a browser for that... Not possible
[00:49:25] <coldhead> Godot: $('a', element);
[00:49:35] <mazzachre> That ypp..
[00:49:35] <coldhead> where element is a node to start searching from
[00:49:56] <mazzachre> s/ypp/too (Moving right hand back to keyboard)
[00:50:24] <Mannimarco> mazzachre: how abouot php?
[00:50:42] <Robbington> Hey, I have an iframe, which I am using as a a sort of image manager. What would be the best way to observe the src of the iframe so I can watch when it changes and get the url params
[00:50:43] <Robbington> ?
[00:51:12] <bigmeow> coldhead: which emacs plugin can support jquery?
[00:51:22] <Godot> Ok, I did not try $(element). Thanks a lot.
[00:53:28] <matt___> hi peeps
[00:55:29] <matt___> I've got the following html http://pastie.org/4448457 and struggling how to traverse properly
[00:55:54] <matt___> i want to click on the A element and cause a click action on the h3 element
[00:57:25] <matt___> $(a).bind('click',function(){$(this).parent('div').parent('div').next('div div h3.heading-more2').click(); })
[00:57:31] <matt___> this is what i have so far
[01:00:26] <nemo_09> hello
[01:00:30] <matt___> hi
[01:00:41] <nemo_09> im new to jquery and got a problem
[01:00:48] <nemo_09> maybe someone here can explain ?
[01:01:57] <coldhead> can you be more specific
[01:02:03] <coldhead> have you tried turning it off and on?
[01:02:15] <nemo_09> haha yes :D ok i try to explain it
[01:02:20] <ch3mical> Is it plugged in?
[01:02:40] <ch3mical> coldhead: IT Crowd reference?
[01:02:45] <nemo_09> ive got a css file, in there is a webkit-keyframe translate and rotate item
[01:02:50] <nemo_09>  @-webkit-keyframes rotate{
[01:02:50] <nemo_09>                  0% {
[01:02:50] <nemo_09>                  transform:rotate3d(1,0,1,45deg);
[01:02:50] <nemo_09>                  -webkit-transform:rotate3d(1,0,1,45deg);
[01:02:50] <nemo_09>                  }
[01:02:55] <ch3mical> whoa
[01:02:56] <nemo_09> looking like this for example
[01:02:58] <coldhead> it predates IT crowd but sure :)
[01:02:59] <ch3mical> hey now
[01:03:02] <Godot> matt__ I believe, your next wont work
[01:03:03] <ch3mical> Let's not get excited
[01:03:07] <coldhead> matt___: i suggest you use closest() instead of parent()
[01:03:23] <Godot> next()
[01:03:32] <coldhead> ?p
[01:03:38] <coldhead> damn you b-ot
[01:03:45] <nemo_09> i want to write a function in jquery where i can change these values of rotate by random
[01:03:46] <ch3mical> T_T
[01:04:04] <nemo_09> but dont know how to acces the css file with the code
[01:04:15] <ch3mical> nemo_09: you don't "access the css file"
[01:04:45] <ch3mical> nemo_09: http://api.jquery.com/css
[01:05:07] <granden> If I want to access the image in a table row(tr)s last td field. That has the closs vald. How should I make a selector for that.
[01:05:15] <granden> $(this, ) something I guess.
[01:05:31] <granden> but would a $(this, '.vald') be neough?
[01:05:39] <coldhead> nemo_09: it may be simplest to generate a huge CSS file with a different class for every value
[01:05:50] <coldhead> and then use jQuery to add/remove the appropriate class
[01:05:53] <coldhead> as needed
[01:06:10] <nemo_09> hmm goal is to create 3 objects, for example rectangles with random properties
[01:06:25] <nemo_09> has someone a short code example of how to do it?
[01:06:35] <ch3mical> Look up HTML5 Canvas ;P
[01:10:21] <Cork> granden: you want the last td of a tr with the class .vald or the last td of the table with the class .vald?
[01:10:48] <Cork> or rather the last td with a class .vald of the table
[01:11:13] <Cork> bah... man thats hard to say without it sounding dumb or confusing >_<
[01:11:25] <granden> haha
[01:11:27] <granden> sorry
[01:11:55] <granden> <tr> <td></td><td></td>...<td><img class='vald'></td></tr>
[01:12:06] <Cork> uh
[01:12:21] <granden> so I know which row I'm at by $(this)
[01:12:23] <Cork> ok so you want the last img.vald of the table?
[01:12:33] <granden> no of the row I'm hovering.
[01:12:48] <granden> got $(#drop1 tr).hover(function(){ }
[01:12:50] <Cork> $(this).find('.vald').last()
[01:13:03] <Cork> $(this).find('img.vald').last()
[01:13:17] <granden> Ok, thanks, will give it a try.
[01:14:31] <coldhead> good luck everyone! may all your bugs be immediately resolved
[01:14:40] <Cork> :D
[01:15:33] <granden> Cork: Thanks! Works perfect!
[01:15:48] <Cork> np
[01:15:59] <granden> One question though. That .last
[01:16:08] <granden> is ith the last result of the find?
[01:16:33] <Cork> yes
[01:16:45] <granden> If so I think I should be fine without it. As it is only one img with .vald in each row. Its located in the last td.
[01:16:48] <Cork> so its the last img.vald in the dom for that row
[01:16:59] <Cork> granden: then yes
[01:17:03] <Cork> you can skip it
[01:20:43] <ak> hey, i have this regexp ^[a-zA-Z√§√∂√º√ü√Ñ√ú√ñ]{0,}$ to test some input fields, is there a way to tell why the test fails, if it fails (like: "the first wrong character was '2', and is not allowed, or something"...
[01:22:32] <flam_> you could test the pattern with ^[a-zA-Zetc..]+ and see the length of the match
[01:24:08] <some_dude> include datatables in jq UI? naaah , lets develop our own from scratch it'll be easy....
[01:24:09] <ak> how can i see the length of the match?
[01:24:20] <flam_> or something like ^([a-zA-Zetc.])*([^a-zA-Zetc]) if you want the first non-matching character
[01:24:27] <flam_> depends on your language
[01:24:35] <ak> javascript ;)
[01:33:11] <Robbington> Hey, I have an iframe, which I am using as a a sort of image manager. What would be the best way to observe the src of the iframe so I can watch when it changes?
[01:35:24] <ak> you need to put some javascript in the iframe
[01:35:37] <ak> that will send a "message"
[01:40:24] <jrockjiggz> i'm trying to use bbq plugin, first click it works, second click nothing happens.. i'm not doing anything just watching a console.log message.. any thoughts on how to find the cause? (nothing is loading in or out)
[01:40:36] <jrockjiggz> the command: $.bbq.pushState(params);
[01:41:47] <jrockjiggz> ah, i see this is default beahvior
[01:44:13] <codemagician> I'm currently returning an html fragment from the server and using $.ajax to retrieve the contents.  However, now I have no way to return error status if the fragment I request isn't available.  Can anyone recommend?
[01:45:18] <some_dude> codemagician, return json and iclude status message
[01:46:39] <Cork> codemagician: http errors
[01:46:57] <Cork> codemagician: return status 404 if the fragment doesn't exist
[01:47:23] <Cork> codemagician: thats what its for after all :)
[01:47:25] <codemagician> Cork, I wondered about this, but what happens if I want to signal something else.. that
[01:47:39] <codemagician> The HTTP codes are for status on the request, not the application data
[01:47:41] <Cork> codemagician: theres loads of status codes
[01:47:51] <Cork> and there are even a range for "custom"
[01:48:10] <codemagician> I was considering returning JSON and having a field html: "<h1>goes here</h1>"
[01:48:33] <jrockjiggz> does anyone know how to implement nested bbq plugin?
[01:48:41] <Cork> ya, thats a way to do it, you need to string escape all the html if you do though
[01:49:06] <codemagician> Cork, it's a solution but it just seems like I'm muddling the HTTP response codes with my application codes which are effectively on different layers
[01:49:32] <Cork> codemagician: not really 3xx is client errors 5xx is server errors
[01:49:33] <jrockjiggz> why not in success callback, have if( $('#el').length > 0){ ... }else{ alert('not found') }
[01:49:35] <some_dude> $('#table tbody tr').click(function(){
[01:49:40] <Cork> its in the specifications
[01:49:52] <some_dude>  $('#table tbody tr').click(function(){   doesn't work . any idea why?
[01:50:18] <Cork> some_dude: you almost always click a td not the tr
[01:50:26] <jrockjiggz> some_dude: You need to put a > tbody in between > table and > tr:
[01:50:31] <Cork> but does the tr exist when you bind the listner?
[01:50:34] <codemagician> Cork, but the errors could be things like "product out of stock", or "this" or "that" where those application 'errors' are nothing to do with the HTTP spec
[01:50:51] <Cork> jrockjiggz: no you don't
[01:50:59] <codemagician> It would be hard to massage the application codes into the HTTP response codes
[01:51:24] <jrockjiggz> Cork: my bad, you are right
[01:52:27] <some_dude> Cork, td doesn't work either. strange. $('#table') not working wtf?
[01:52:42] <jrockjiggz> codemagician: how exactly are you doing fragmenting with $.ajax?
[01:53:16] <Godot> some_dude: you are sure you mean #table with #?
[01:53:49] <Cork> some_dude: does the table id exist in the do when your trying to select it?
[01:54:14] <some_dude> Cork, yep.
[01:54:28] <Cork> codemagician: well its a server error so a 530 or something would be fine
[01:54:48] <Cork> some_dude: where are you running the selector?
[01:55:03] <codemagician> Cork, I don't think it makes sense to use HTTP codes to signal an item is not in stock
[01:55:17] <codemagician> because technically the AJAX request has completed so should return 200
[01:55:38] <codemagician> jrockjiggz, I'm decide between calling using dataType: 'html' and 'json'
[01:56:54] <Cork> codemagician: well just as an example you do have "402 Payment Required", so...
[01:58:19] <codemagician> Cork, I see where the HTTP codes apply when they do apply.  But these status codes are not HTTP related
[01:59:02] <codemagician> If I return raw html fragments then I have to implement my own format to return status codes
[01:59:06] <Cork> codemagician: the idea is to just flag that something went wrong through the status error
[01:59:13] <Cork> then have the reason in the body
[01:59:27] <blackspotwiggins> Cork, 4xx is client errors actually
[01:59:30] <blackspotwiggins> otherwise yea
[01:59:40] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: i know, and i said so
[01:59:48] <some_dude> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/m8HKn/3/ it works fine. no ide why it doesn't work in my case...
[01:59:51] <blackspotwiggins> "<Cork> codemagician: not really 3xx is client errors" :)
[01:59:59] <Cork> lol opps
[02:00:07] <Cork> thats redirects >_<''
[02:00:28] <codemagician> I not sure I see how the HTTP codes can be used to signal that the request wasn't completed
[02:00:38] <Cork> some_dude: http://jsfiddle.net/m8HKn/4/
[02:00:40] <blackspotwiggins> codemagician, it depends on how you look at it
[02:00:56] <codemagician> if my application replies to say "here is the data" or replies to say "not in stock" or whatever then the HTTP code should still be 200 right?
[02:00:59] <blackspotwiggins> if you try to perform some action on a resource and it fails for some reason, it should not return 200
[02:01:18] <blackspotwiggins> since http is a method for accessing resources
[02:01:19] <codemagician> define "fails"
[02:01:25] <Cork> codemagician: the status code should be 200 if the server could complete what the client asked for
[02:01:28] <codemagician> fails at the transport level
[02:01:37] <blackspotwiggins> fails at anyt level
[02:01:39] <codemagician> then a HTTP code other than 200 should be sent right?
[02:01:43] <Cork> codemagician: if the server replies that it failed 200 is ... wrong
[02:01:48] <blackspotwiggins> 403 for example - not authorized
[02:01:54] <blackspotwiggins> transport works fine
[02:02:03] <blackspotwiggins> just the user can not perform said action
[02:02:18] <codemagician> but if it "fails" as in "product 12345 isn't available" then should the HTTP response code still be 200 but the application status embedded into the response data
[02:02:24] <blackspotwiggins> 404 then?
[02:02:25] <Cork> some_dude: make sure your code is wrapped in $(function() {});
[02:02:38] <Cork> :)
[02:02:43] <blackspotwiggins> or 407 (iirc) for temporary unavailability
[02:02:55] * Cork agrees
[02:02:56] <codemagician> well, if you have application codes like "blue shoes aren't cool"
[02:03:06] <some_dude> Cork, what exactly did you change?
[02:03:12] <codemagician> you can't use HTTP codes to fit the application
[02:03:15] <blackspotwiggins> yea sure
[02:03:16] <Cork> some_dude: the dropdown on the left
[02:03:32] <Cork> some_dude: jsfiddle wraps it in event code by default
[02:04:11] <some_dude> Cork, yea my code is included in $(document).ready({ ... duh of course.
[02:04:39] <Cork> some_dude: do you have a link?
[02:05:45] <granden> Ok, got another kind of trouble selector I would need help with if anyone is up for it. Ok I got a table and each row looks ilke this <tr><td></td><td class='summa1'></td><td class='summa2'><td class='summa3'></td><td>Click here</td></tr>
[02:06:13] <granden> So the users press the click here. ANd when they do. I want to grap from the same tr the content of the td with class=summa
[02:06:19] <some_dude> Cork, nah but there's no difference whatsoever to what I posted in the fiddle
[02:06:19] <granden> summa1/2
[02:06:46] <Cork> $(this).closes('tr').find('.summa1, .summa2')
[02:07:06] <granden> need them seperated. So summa1 only in one and summa2 in one.
[02:07:08] <granden> But thanks.
[02:08:38] <granden> Cork: I get an error running that
[02:08:39] <granden> SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'closes'
[02:08:39] <granden> indexie.html, line 40 character 6
[02:09:00] <Godot> its closest()
[02:09:16] <granden> ah
[02:09:28] <Cork> lol typo
[02:09:43] * Godot hands Cork a brand new t
[02:10:13] * Cork glues it onto the string
[02:10:18] <marianoguerra> hi! I found a bug on jquery and jqueryui (1.8.0 and 1.8.22 respectively) the bug happens when using jq 1.8.0 but not when using 1.7.2, should I report it to jq issue tracker or jq ui>
[02:10:22] <marianoguerra> ?
[02:10:25] <Cork> a bit crocked, but its there :)
[02:10:56] <Cork> marianoguerra: most likely jquery-ui
[02:11:15] <marianoguerra> Cork: ok, thanks, here is a gist to reproduce the bug https://gist.github.com/3312762
[02:11:23] <Cork> marianoguerra: make sure to search the database first, newer versions of jquery tend to break jquery-ui
[02:12:29] <Cork> marianoguerra: you prob want to provide a rending link instead
[02:12:37] <Cork> marianoguerra: something like jsfiddle
[02:13:15] <marianoguerra> Cork: I already looked, it seems it's not there, about jsfiddle, I couldn't make it work there (didn't use it too much yet, only for small things)
[02:13:32] <marianoguerra> I can't find a CDN with jqui 1.8.22
[02:13:47] <marianoguerra> and jsfiddle doesn't have jqui as an option
[02:14:02] <Cork> you can load it from your own server if you like (or github)
[02:14:18] <Cork> jsfiddle has an option to add resources
[02:14:36] <marianoguerra> I will add it from the gist
[02:16:54] <jrockjiggz> if I have var params = {bool: true}, how come if(params.bool == true){ } doesn't work? where (params.bool == 'true') does
[02:17:22] <jrockjiggz> oh nm. its probably a plugin i'm using i guess
[02:17:40] <tehcyx> hey guys
[02:18:39] <tehcyx> got a problem understanding how promises work. my problem is described here: http://pastebin.com/VmnQJ8gL any ideas?
[02:19:51] <Cork> tehcyx: you create the deferred object
[02:20:05] <Cork> add your info and return the object from your function
[02:21:41] <ENQ> why there is no delegate method, and how to use current ON if i need to achiev same thing as with delegate?
[02:24:18] <tehcyx> hm i'
[02:24:23] <Cork> ENQ: delegate isn't depricated
[02:24:28] <tehcyx> hm i'm not getting the point Cork
[02:24:32] <Cork> ENQ: live is though
[02:24:39] <ENQ> hmm
[02:25:34] <Cork> ENQ: though delegate maps almost 1:1 against on
[02:26:05] <ENQ> Cork, i have to set selector to ON method so it will behave like delegate?
[02:26:15] <Cork> .delegate('.class', 'click', function() {}); => .on('click', '.class', function() {});
[02:26:25] <ENQ> i need that this would refer to button to a parent
[02:26:39] <ENQ> oh
[02:26:41] <ENQ> thanks
[02:27:48] <Anticom> hi all
[02:28:18] <Anticom> how do i mark the whole text inside an input[type=text] using jquery?
[02:28:50] <Anticom> i want to make it easier to copy the content but i came to the conclusion, that automatic copying to clipboard is pain in the ass :D
[02:28:56] <codemagician> Cork, I'm starting to understand what you suggested now.
[02:29:15] <Cork> Anticom: $('input:focused')[0].select();
[02:29:30] <codemagician> Cork, so I'm thinking I could use the HTTP response codes to indicate broad responses and then include an application specific response inside the returned JSON object
[02:29:32] <flam_> what do you mean by marking it?
[02:29:36] <Anticom> thank's a lot Cork :)
[02:30:15] <Cork> flam_: select, the text in the input field
[02:30:28] <Anticom> Cork so .select() is native js? or is it jq?
[02:30:34] <Cork> native
[02:30:37] <Anticom> wow
[02:30:55] <Anticom> it's hard to accept, that things in native js are that simple since i'm using jQuery :D
[02:31:10] <tehcyx> Cork: in the sample below i created a Deffered object, i create a var, to add a function to it where i call my first ajax request within. make this the promise and to resolve it i pass the obj needed to fullfil the function. as i understand promises from the api when i call obj.done the code in this is executed after the ajax call is made?
[02:31:35] <tehcyx> or do i need to go into requestAccessToken and put a promise on the ajax function?
[02:31:40] <codemagician> Cork, but can I ask your advice on one issue I'm still unsure about.  How do I differentiate between a 404 (when the resource URL was entered incorrectly) and passing a 404 with a JSON response saying { message: "The XYZ you were looking for is not in stock" }
[02:32:09] <marianoguerra> in case someone wants to take a look http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8485
[02:32:18] <NodeX> a 404 should ONLY be returned for a missing resource (page)
[02:32:41] <NodeX> 404's should not be used for stock control
[02:32:52] <codemagician> NodeX, I'm making up an example
[02:33:03] <codemagician> NodeX, but what I mean is let's say the product isn't in the catalog
[02:33:05] <Cork> tehcyx: theres no magic in deferred, it resolves when you resolve it, it will keep the resolve state if you tell it to though
[02:33:21] <codemagician> NodeX, versus say the resource URL being mistyped
[02:33:47] <NodeX> how can the URL be mistyped - it's an ajax request no?
[02:33:55] <flam_> codemagician, perhaps 204 (No Content)
[02:34:01] <Cork> codemagician: you might want to have a look at restful resources
[02:34:09] <NodeX> ^ +1
[02:34:27] <Cork> cause thats where i based my suggestions on
[02:34:32] <codemagician> Cork, is there a standard for using the HTTP response codes
[02:34:36] <Cork> yes
[02:34:43] <codemagician> Cork, or should I pick the most appropriate looking one
[02:34:46] <tehcyx> Cork: so i need to resolve from the success event from the ajax call instead, is that what you mean?
[02:34:48] <Cork> ?g wiki restful resource
[02:34:49] <b-ot> Cork, Representational state transfer - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ‚Üí http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer
[02:34:54] <Cork> -_-'
[02:34:57] <Cork> not even close
[02:35:12] <codemagician> well, 404 is missing resource right?
[02:35:22] <Cork> codemagician: http://microformats.org/wiki/rest/urls
[02:35:38] <codemagician> if call a URL endpoint which is spelled wrong I will get a 404 from the server
[02:36:04] <Cork> codemagician: read that url it will prob make much more sense afterwards
[02:36:33] <Cork> tehcyx: if you want to trigger the state from that state, yes
[02:36:47] <tehcyx> Cork: thanks, i'll try that
[02:36:53] <Cork> tehcyx: deferred is just a fancy way to code callbacks
[02:37:05] <Cork> functionality theres little difference
[02:47:08] <codemagician> Cork, Ah, so 404 Not Found would be "server has not found anything matching the Request-URL" and since it's a read operation it should be a GET request so in fact the url would be domain.com/resource?id=1234
[02:47:37] <Cork> codemagician: yup
[02:47:43] <codemagician> Cork, I was using an incorrect POST to request the resource
[02:48:00] <Cork> or domain.com/resource/1234 if you want to use url rewrite
[02:48:11] <codemagician> Cork, that's why I couldn't see how to differentiate between a "missing url" and missing product
[02:48:22] <Cork> codemagician: post should only be used if you change anything
[02:48:29] <codemagician> Cork, but using a GET request the missing product equates to the URL itself
[02:50:32] <codemagician> Cork, because GET is idempotent.  I finally get it.  Thanks for your patience
[02:50:44] <Cork> np
[02:51:01] <codemagician> Cork, my API is going to be a hellava lot tidier now. Thanks :)
[02:51:09] <Cork> :)
[02:55:05] <rabbi1> how can i get multiple datepicker working for selecting duration (from) and (to) ?
[02:55:34] <ak> anybody knows with this jquery validate plugin, when i add some custom validator, can i return some variables for the error message?
[02:56:22] <rabbi1> I am able to do it for one single fromdate and todate field, but what if i have multiple date range selection ? should i create different class names for each datepicker ?
[03:03:13] <rabbi1> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1139311/ this is what i have been using, this works good for one single elements. what should i do if i have multiple datapickers ?
[03:07:30] <rabbi1> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1139311/ this is what i have been using, this works good for one single elements. what should i do if i have multiple datapickers ?
[03:38:48] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/9ggsW/3/ is this a correct code for multiple select of datepickers ?
[03:49:43] <imran-uk> hi, i'm taking first steps with jquery-ui - what i'm having throuble with is basic thiongs like creating a list of books with the "pencil icon" next to it, is there any good primer for the "css-foo" i need to work with jquery-ui?
[03:55:28] <rabbi1> can some one guide me on this multiple daterange picker ? http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/9ggsW/7/
[03:58:08] <codemagician> If I'm using JSON GET requests should I use $.getJSON(...) or $.ajax(..)
[03:58:22] <codemagician> Is there any advantage to using $.ajax()
[03:59:43] <blaamann> I am searching for JQuery and cookie and this plugin looks good https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/, is that a plugin recommended?
[04:00:06] <masak> codemagician: according to http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/, $.getJSON(...) is just sugar for $.ajax(..)
[04:00:11] <flam_> i used it in one project and it worked fine for my small purposes
[04:00:22] <rabbi1> can some one guide me on this multiple daterange picker ? http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/9ggsW/7/
[04:00:44] <codemagician> masak, seems if i want the most flexibility for handling errors and successes I should use the $.ajax then
[04:01:40] <Nancy2012> how can i do‚Ä¶ if the current tab is first then‚Ä¶ load "a" div
[04:01:43] <Nancy2012> ?
[04:05:02] <adam_lynch> Nancy2012: .index() would help; http://api.jquery.com/index/
[04:05:13] <Nancy2012> thanks
[04:08:31] <masak> codemagician: yes, probably.
[04:10:12] <tehcyx> so i still got this problem with promises: http://pastebin.com/dtPV6fwW why is that? does success interfere the call of .done() ?
[04:10:36] <tehcyx> f4 is called, but i don't get request data in it
[04:11:06] <tehcyx> either f4 is called before the data is set or success interferes something
[04:17:51] <tehcyx> no ideas?
[04:19:56] <Godot> not me
[04:20:58] <tehcyx> does the multiple return of the deferred object returned by the ajax call maybe interfere something?
[04:22:53] <lduros> I have something like 50 buttons
[04:22:57] <lduros> and I want click on them
[04:23:05] <lduros> listening for clicks, I should say.
[04:23:25] <lduros> if I do $('body').on("click", "button", function (e) { });
[04:23:34] <tehcyx> $('.buttonClass').click(function() {});
[04:23:52] <lduros> tehcyx: but each have to trigger a different function
[04:23:59] <lduros> so is using on() with delegation
[04:24:09] <lduros> then checking the id with a switch () { } good practice?
[04:25:05] <tehcyx> lduros: http://pastebin.com/dtPV6fwW this is what my structure looks like
[04:25:28] <lduros> $("body").on("click", "button", function (e) { var elemId = $(this).attr("id"); switch (elemId) { case "blah": blahFunction(); break; case "blob": blobFunction(); break; }});
[04:25:30] <lduros> is that ok?
[04:26:31] <tehcyx> this probably should do it
[04:26:39] <tehcyx> but i don't know any better either
[04:26:47] <lduros> I'm wondering in terms of performance
[04:26:51] <lduros> the switch is a little lengthy
[04:27:10] <lduros> but a switch on a string (the id) should be fast in any case, faster than having many listeners, I would think
[04:28:04] <tehcyx> i still think it's a bad thing to switch a string ;)
[04:28:22] <lduros> why?
[04:28:33] <tehcyx> switch is for numbers
[04:28:33] <Godot> if you cant combine the functions to save a few, you have to do it this way
[04:28:49] <tehcyx> http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp
[04:29:02] <Godot> well yes, I would try numbers too, maybe even put the functions in an array :-)
[04:29:31] <lduros> Godot: well I'm just refactoring some code so that I can remove all the onClick=""
[04:30:18] <lduros> _or_
[04:30:26] <lduros> I make an object with the id as the property
[04:30:28] <Godot> yeah, I have done it like that before
[04:30:36] <lduros> Godot: which way?
[04:30:44] <Godot> with a switch
[04:30:49] <lduros> and a string?
[04:30:57] <lduros> @Godot?
[04:31:10] <Godot> yes even that, but if theres a way, I would prefer numbers
[04:31:14] <sunbeam> How can I make sure that when a sub item, ul li ul li.current-item has that class, the main LI also has this class?
[04:31:54] <lduros> Godot: yeh ok, so I'll leave it as is for now... ;-)
[04:31:55] <lduros> thanks
[04:35:20] <Godot> sunbeam harder than it sounds
[04:35:24] <Godot> hehe
[04:36:03] <Godot> I would try with .each()
[04:37:02] <Cork> well
[04:37:46] <Cork> $('li.current-item').each(function() { $(this).parents().first().addClass('current-item'); });
[04:38:28] <tehcyx> http://pastebin.com/AKH0zh1e output is: 1 2 3 5 4 why is that?
[04:39:46] <tehcyx> can i access xhr object in .done() ?
[04:40:19] <Cork> tehcyx: yes, but try .compete() instead
[04:41:11] <tehcyx> still call 5 before 4, how can i access xhr in .done() ?
[04:41:58] <Cork> don't think done provides xhr
[04:42:27] <Cork> hmm interesting
[04:42:32] <Cork> Deprecation Notice: The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callbacks will be deprecated in jQuery 1.8. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead.
[04:42:37] <Cork> thats new to me
[04:42:59] <tehcyx> yeah that's why iam rewriting this
[04:43:09] <tehcyx> but it doesn't work
[04:43:23] <tehcyx> and because async gets an deprecation
[04:43:52] <tehcyx> i really need to have f4 executed after everything else in this
[04:44:20] <tehcyx> and all the functions are in a different Base,js class
[04:45:35] <Cork> tehcyx: why don't you just set .done after your ajax call before you return it?
[04:45:44] <Cork> return $.ajax().done();
[04:45:57] <tehcyx> i need it in a different class
[04:46:06] <Cork> what do you mean?
[04:46:14] <Cork> ah no thats not what i meant
[04:46:50] <Cork> function do() { return $.ajax().done(function() { /* local */ }) };       do().done(function() { /* another one */ })
[04:46:50] <tehcyx> Cork: what you meant then?
[04:47:04] <tehcyx> ah
[04:47:10] <tehcyx> i'll try that, thanks
[04:47:15] <Cork> you can use done/fail/aways as many times as you like
[04:48:09] <tehcyx> but i again have no xhr in done
[04:48:21] <tehcyx> or am i reading the api wrong?
[04:48:32] <Cork> should be function(msg, xhr) if i remember correct
[04:48:38] <Cork> one sec let me check the code
[04:51:22] <Cork> tehcyx: deferred.resolveWith( callbackContext, [ success, statusText, jqXHR ] );
[04:52:27] <Cork> and always is completeDeferred.fireWith( callbackContext, [ jqXHR, statusText ] );
[04:52:58] <tehcyx> Cork: nice, thanks
[04:53:14] <tehcyx> where did you find that? http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/ wont tell me this
[04:56:28] <tehcyx> still ajax.done is processed after f2().done(); this drives me crazy
[04:56:41] <tehcyx> @Cork
[05:00:26] <codemagician> My JSON response object contains an attribute 'html' which contains some ready-made HTML that I want to inject into the page.  Should I do this inside the callback of the $.ajax() method or should I attach a global ajaxComplete listener to the object and have the object pull it in place?
[05:01:25] <DireFog> sooooo‚Ä¶ is there a "good" way to signal the client that it should load another page depending on the result of an ajax call? Redirects are followed transparently. I guess I could just return e.g. a 205 with a location header, but that doesn't feel right :-/
[05:03:19] <Teduardo> howdy sirs.. is this valid? it doesn't seem to work for me $('#a').load('http://google.com');
[05:05:11] <klawd_prime> Teduardo: looks legit.
[05:05:21] <klawd_prime> although: might not work because of XSS-preventions
[05:05:36] <granden> Can I in an easy way check if an div has display:none; or display:block?
[05:05:46] <needlz> i'm trying to refresh the content of a div-section only after a jquery.get, but it inserts into the <div id="refreshConent"> area the whole html page. is there a way to refresh that part only? here is what I tried: http://pastebin.com/vQMpVKMR
[05:05:58] <klawd_prime> granden: .attr('display'); but maybe you want .is(':visible')?
[05:06:00] <tehcyx> @Cork my pastebin works correctly, either the response is too slow or i'm doing something else wrong
[05:06:19] <tehcyx> i'll debug for now... i hate this
[05:07:11] <granden> Hmm, dunno, I just want to check wheter it is #div2 or #div3 that has display:block; (the other got display:none;)
[05:07:23] <granden> wanan run different code depending on that.
[05:08:15] <blackspotwiggins> Teduardo, it wont work, SOP wont allow crossdomain ajax
[05:08:50] <needlz> i've never touched jQuery/JS before, but I really need this for the project, so sorry for the maybe lame question
[05:09:17] <Teduardo> klawd_prime: you're referring to this? is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. =]
[05:09:54] <Teduardo> guess i'll have to just redirect them =)
[05:10:22] <klawd_prime> maybe
[05:10:47] <klawd_prime> granden: answer stands.
[05:11:00] <granden> klawd_prime: What would is(':visible') do? Would it return fales for display:none and true for display:block or only for visiblity property?
[05:11:31] <klawd_prime> granden: you could also go $.fn.isBlock = function() { return $(this).css('display') == 'block'; }
[05:11:39] <klawd_prime> and then $('#foo').isBlock();
[05:12:02] <granden> so thats how I create a jquery function cool :)
[05:12:21] <klawd_prime> granden: not sure entirely but i think it checks for visible, opacity and display
[05:12:27] <granden> Thanks, really great.
[05:12:28] <granden> ok
[05:12:33] <Teduardo> dont suppose there is a jquery vnc client?
[05:13:02] <granden> klawd_prime: Would I have that in side my document ready or outside? (The function)?
[05:13:25] <klawd_prime> you can do it outside as long as jquery is loaded
[05:13:34] <granden> ok
[05:14:03] <some_dude> what's a good plugin for displaying source code? like I got a xml string and Iwanna output it properly formated and highlited etc?
[05:17:40] <needlz> how can I load with .html only a certain part of a html? e.g. $('#refreshContent').html(data, '#refreshContent');
[05:17:51] <needlz> where data is the whole html
[05:18:31] <klawd_prime> needlz: $(html).find('#refreshContent')
[05:20:40] <needlz> klawd_prime: Thanks. How would I do that in combination with $('#refreshContent').html(data)?
[05:21:08] <klawd_prime> do you want to replace content or add new?
[05:21:20] <needlz> klawd_prime: just replace
[05:21:54] <needlz> klawd_prime: it's for a <select/>, I want to update the content of a <div> after the select box changed
[05:21:56] <klawd_prime> you prob. want $('#refreshContent').rep√laceWith($(htm).find('#refreshContent'))
[05:21:58] <klawd_prime> or some such
[05:23:49] <kazim59> How do I know if one HTML element is within another element or not?
[05:24:07] <kazim59> I need to know if event.target is within $('.rightPane') or not...
[05:24:17] <needlz> klawd_prime: like $('#refreshContent').replaceWith($(data).find('#refreshContent')); ?
[05:24:54] <needlz> where data is the html content (from jquery.get())
[05:25:34] <klawd_prime> yes
[05:26:20] <kazim59> I guess jQuery.find()
[05:26:50] <sunbeam> Cork: thanks
[05:26:51] <klawd_prime> would think so too, yes kazim59
[05:27:01] <kazim59> klawd_prime: thanks, trying it now
[05:27:09] <needlz> klawd_prime: that worked like a charm :) thanks a lot!
[05:27:17] <sunbeam> Cork: but i think it should be about the most top level parent li
[05:28:06] <klawd_prime> yw needlz
[05:28:17] <sunbeam> actually my bad
[05:28:23] <sunbeam> .current-menu-parent
[05:28:31] <sunbeam> this is in WP automatically already given
[05:29:26] <tehcyx> i have taken down my problem to another level. i need to call methods from within an anonymous function
[05:29:27] <Teduardo> is there anyway to prevent people from typing anything but numbers into the jquery ui slider text field? its annoying when people type 'lol' on the box
[05:29:30] <Thumper> Hu
[05:29:40] <Teduardo> can you block keystrokes for those boxes?
[05:29:47] <Thumper> I am trying to set a div to be at a fixed position with "position: fixed;"
[05:30:30] <Thumper> However I don't want it to "scroll" after a certain point
[05:30:40] <tehcyx> how can i call methods in an anonymous function?
[05:30:47] <tehcyx> or access variables?
[05:30:53] <Thumper> I know that this is not possible using css, and I tried to listen to the scroll event
[05:31:15] <Thumper> Any ideas on what I should be doing?
[05:31:27] <kazim59> klawd_prime: it returned []. How to use it in conditional? i.e. false when empty?
[05:32:03] <klawd_prime> .length
[05:32:29] <kazim59> Isn't jQuery.contains better?
[05:32:47] <klawd_prime> might be, dunno.
[05:34:51] <phrearch> hi
[05:35:12] <phrearch> i have two selectors pointing to the same element. how can i check whether they are the same properly?
[05:35:38] <phrearch> $('#foo') == $(this).parent().find('a
[05:35:41] <phrearch> ')
[05:35:43] <phrearch> or something
[05:37:32] <phrearch> i could use .text() but it doesnt seem a very clean solution
[05:41:02] <aleray> hi, do you know a good open source plugin to handle complex key events like "ctrl + shift + up"?
[05:47:43] <blobl> bloody curly braces :D
[05:47:54] <blobl> haha
[06:04:05] <klawd_prime> can you somehow make .highlight fade back to a color of your own choosing instead of white?
[06:19:37] <w00tner> hi guys good morning in the morning!
[06:21:03] <JeffreyLevesque> woot woot
[06:21:07] <w00tner> w000tw00t
[06:23:15] <w00tner> how can i retrieve an element value from a <li> in an onclick with jquery? this element value is stored in a JSON object.
[06:24:06] <JeffreyLevesque> don't know JSON
[06:24:14] <JeffreyLevesque> but have you tried: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/551538/jquery-value-of-element
[06:25:03] <w00tner> holy
[06:25:09] <w00tner> nice
[06:25:54] <JeffreyLevesque> w00tner++ lol
[06:26:40] <w00tner> actually i have that code but i thought it wouldn't work
[06:27:16] <Godot> { rocks: Jeffrey }
[06:27:22] <w00tner> that's json
[06:27:27] <w00tner> io i i i i i i i i i i i i ii   h h h h hh
[06:28:13] <w00tner> i just need to create this function to retrieve thje value, then the listview using json objects, then manipulate camera with phonegap and then im rich
[06:28:22] <w00tner> keeeeep dreeaminnnn'1!!
[06:29:00] <JeffreyLevesque> dreams (even if they are unrealistic) gives you a direction
[06:29:19] <w00tner> tell that to my wife, mate!
[06:30:43] <w00tner> hey Jeffrey can i ask you a question ?
[06:31:37] <w00tner> just need to add onClick="function('clickz0r');" to the element
[06:32:04] <w00tner> and then put those 3 lines in a <script type=js> function clickz0r {
[06:32:24] <w00tner> ?
[06:32:38] <w00tner> or am i a noobster ?
[06:33:47] <JeffreyLevesque> why don't you just have an external js file
[06:33:59] <JeffreyLevesque> and assign a class to the specific html
[06:34:07] <JeffreyLevesque> then a click event to that class
[06:34:12] <w00tner> because i will wrap it up with phonegap and i think everything must be in the same file
[06:34:13] <JeffreyLevesque> well if it's three lines i guess
[06:34:40] <JeffreyLevesque> do it up :)
[06:34:59] <w00tner> i have a 200 lines little program now
[06:35:08] <w00tner> i have been like 1 month but i think i will make it
[06:35:10] <w00tner> yeah!
[06:35:10] <JeffreyLevesque> i gotta go
[06:35:13] <w00tner> have fun
[06:35:15] <JeffreyLevesque> but use this thing: http://jsfiddle.net/
[06:35:21] <w00tner> ok
[06:35:21] <JeffreyLevesque> and if you get stuck
[06:35:24] <Gx4> hi
[06:35:33] <JeffreyLevesque> paste your code here, and perhaps someone can help you later :)
[06:35:45] <JeffreyLevesque> *well paste the link of your fiddle
[06:35:54] <w00tner> perfect, thank you.
[06:35:57] <masak> w00tner: you don't need 'type=js' on the <script> tag.
[06:36:13] <w00tner> ok, masak
[06:36:46] <Gx4> I've tried $(#iframe).contents().wrap("<html />") ir works, but I get an extra error Uncaught Error: HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: DOM Exception 3, can anyone help me?
[06:38:30] <Cork> Gx4: why are you wrapping the document in html??
[06:38:32] <sbfds> Hi, can anyone help me troubleshoot why this is working in http://trevordavis.net/play/jquery-one-page-nav/  but not http://jsbin.com/itohiz/1/quiet ?
[06:38:42] <Cork> Gx4: that doesn't make any sense
[06:38:44] <sbfds> try clicking the nav links...
[06:38:56] <Gx4> Cork because it's js script which will not get rendered if it doesn't have html tags
[06:39:06] <Gx4> js script in iframe src
[06:39:13] <Gx4> kinda
[06:39:17] <Cork> uh...
[06:39:23] <Cork> man...
[06:39:24] <Gx4> its asp src in iframe
[06:39:33] <Cork> use a html content and load you js through a normal tag
[06:39:34] <Gx4> and the asp has javascript without html
[06:39:45] <Gx4> its legacy code
[06:39:49] <Cork> use a static html file
[06:40:04] <Cork> what your doing won't ever work correctly
[06:40:18] <Gx4> well actually it does work
[06:40:23] <Gx4> except I get that error
[06:40:26] <Cork> in the browser your testing ya
[06:40:33] <Cork> but you don't know what happens in other ones
[06:40:40] <Cork> and its a bad idea from the start
[06:40:46] <Gx4> ff/chrome works
[06:41:02] <Gx4> the problem with changing it is it is used in many places
[06:41:29] <Gx4> and i only need this fix for preview
[06:45:59] <_ramok> hi
[06:51:14] <Wolf_22> Anyone know why this syntax is bombing? Am I missing a quote? Is one of the commas misplaced? $("#header-middle").css('width':'25%','font-size':'80%');
[06:52:15] <ajpiano> Wolf_22: you havea to use an object literal to do multipe properties
[06:52:34] <ajpiano> .css({width: "25%", "font-size": "80%"})
[06:53:10] <Wolf_22> ajpiano: Ah. I see. Thanks.
[06:56:31] <Thumper> Is the 1.8 module manager available?
[07:02:21] <ppaz> what's the jquery function that when you click it expands vertically to reveal more info
[07:03:54] <Brodingo> ppaz slideDown()
[07:04:40] <ppaz> Thanks Brodingo
[07:06:32] <Thumper> Does anyone know what the minimum value for the duration in animate is?
[07:07:05] <Brodingo> Thumper 0?
[07:08:08] <Thumper> That should make the animation fastest right?
[07:08:35] <klawd_prime> that's like .css
[07:08:40] <Thumper> I mean 1 would be the fastest animation, with higher values make the animation slower
[07:08:46] <Thumper> ?
[07:08:55] <klawd_prime> yes.
[07:09:03] <Thumper> Understood, thanks
[07:09:07] <klawd_prime> it's actually not speed but "duration"
[07:09:19] <Thumper> As in setInterval duration?
[07:09:30] <klawd_prime> uh, no.
[07:09:54] <klawd_prime> it√'s like: please sretch out this animation over a time of n ms
[07:10:20] <Thumper> oh ok
[07:10:38] <evasivx> morning everyone
[07:11:33] <Thumper> morning
[07:17:40] <w00tner> Hi i just tried to retrieve the value of an element using: http://pastebin.com/dhFQuesv
[07:18:06] <w00tner> It works but it starts popping up one more dialog each time i click
[07:18:34] <w00tner> get the value and then shows another dialog with the same value. i close it and then click it again and show plus 1 dialog everytime
[07:19:38] <Brodingo> w00tner get rid of onClick and the clickz0r function
[07:19:59] <Brodingo> just use the event binding
[07:22:17] <Brodingo> also, the value attribute is for input elements
[07:22:48] <w00tner> oh, ok. sthis will be used in <li>
[07:23:20] <EdwardIII> ARGH
[07:26:03] <Brodingo> meow
[07:26:03] <EdwardIII> i can't seem to grab this element with jQuery. i'm pulling it in via ajax, even though i've put my code in .load('...',function(){...'s callback, i can't access it unless i stick a setTimeout on it
[07:26:03] <w00tner> it works Bordingo.
[07:26:03] <christo_m> Is there a good way to have divs not render before theyre in tabs?
[07:26:03] <Brodingo> thanks waatner
[07:26:03] <christo_m> im having tabs ajax loaded, i do a load and show, i close the dialog, then open the dialog again and the data from before is there for a second before going into tabs
[07:26:03] <Brodingo> christo_m have them hidden initially with css
[07:26:03] <christo_m> i dont want the dialog to show anything until the tabs are loaded
[07:26:03] <christo_m> Brodingo: i did that.
[07:26:03] <Brodingo> ?cc
[07:26:03] <b-ot> Brodingo, CASE CLOASED!
[07:26:03] <christo_m> no.
[07:26:03] <christo_m> case re-opened
[07:26:03] <christo_m> exhibit A: display:none on the divs, no avail
[07:26:03] <Brodingo> wut
[07:26:03] <b-ot> is their a polite way of saying your ignorant ajpiano
[07:26:08] <Brodingo> post a fiddle christo_m
[07:26:22] <christo_m> not sure how id do that as i have php code littered in there
[07:32:06] <na3r> i'm looking for an mvc framork that it's router works in ie7, is there any?
[07:32:16] <na3r> i tried sammyjs and canjs
[07:32:33] <na3r> but both router doesn'nt work in ie
[07:32:53] <christo_m> Brodingo: is there some way i can check that .tabs() has finished executing?
[07:33:00] <christo_m> then i can do a show on the div its bound to
[07:33:07] <Brodingo> .tabs() is synchronous
[07:33:07] <b-ot> Brodingo, memorised ‚Äútabs()‚Äù.
[07:33:22] <Brodingo> b-ot forget tabs()
[07:34:21] <christo_m> soo
[07:34:41] <christo_m> i do a show right after, still display noned
[07:37:12] <Gx4> what method waits til file is loaded ?
[07:37:14] <sp0cksbeard> hi, I'm trying to set a global handler for all ajax requests via "ajaxSetup({complete: ‚Ä¶}) ". Is there a way to check if a complete handler has already been setup, so I don't register is twice?
[07:37:15] <jomofcw> Hello !
[07:37:24] <Brodingo> ?load # Gx4
[07:37:27] <jomofcw> Can we detect a redirect in an AJAX request please ?
[07:37:29] <Brodingo> blah
[07:37:31] <Brodingo> ?load
[07:37:45] <Brodingo> damn robot rebellion
[07:37:56] <Gx4> so I can do if (#iframe).contents().load .... ?
[07:38:38] <Brodingo> take out .contents()
[07:39:12] <Gx4> but what does it do if it's not loaded ?
[07:39:30] <Brodingo> nothing?
[07:40:00] <Brodingo> if it loads, then it triggers the load event
[07:40:15] <Gx4> but I need it to wait till it loads
[07:40:28] <Brodingo> yes, thats what it does
[07:44:08] <jomofcw> Can we detect a redirect in an AJAX request please ?
[07:45:14] <johnkpaul> jomofcw: no, you can't
[07:45:28] <blackspotwiggins> jomofcw, newer browsers should follow them automagically
[07:45:35] <blackspotwiggins> old firefox had some problems with it
[07:45:36] <johnkpaul> there is no notification to xhr that a redirect happened
[07:45:48] <blackspotwiggins> there is a new request started
[07:46:15] <jomofcw> OK thanks. Could I have a list of the browser taht work automaticaly with redirect please ?
[07:49:02] <johnkpaul> jomofcw: I don't think there are any currently used browsers with a problem, at least I haven't come across them
[07:51:24] <jomofcw> IE7 OK so ?
[07:53:50] <johnkpaul> ?tias @jomofcw
[07:53:51] <b-ot> jomofcw, Try It And See
[07:55:18] <jomofcw> Hm yep b-ot you're right. I'm just at the start of a project I want to use this feature, so I'm just asking if it's a possible feature.
[07:58:27] <w00tner> Guys, whats wrong with this: $.getJSON('cupones.json', function(data) {
[07:58:27] <w00tner>          var getID =  $(data.empresa);
[07:58:46] <w00tner> i try to get the var getID in console but get that is not defined
[07:59:02] <w00tner> i already try with $(' + data.empresa + ');
[07:59:08] <jomofcw> Have you test you JSON ,
[07:59:15] <johnkpaul> w00tner: what is the value of data.empresa?
[07:59:22] <jomofcw> $(' + data.empresa + '); this is an error anyway
[07:59:32] <johnkpaul> you might need to prepend it with '#'
[07:59:40] <johnkpaul> jomofcw: no it's not, it's just a string
[08:00:01] <w00tner> http://cuponaria.com/json/cupones.json
[08:00:23] <w00tner> its working fine actually i manipulate it here: http://cuponaria.com/json/lectorjson.html
[08:00:43] <johnkpaul> w00tner: that json file isn't valid json
[08:00:46] <w00tner> omg
[08:00:47] <w00tner> is not working
[08:00:51] <w00tner> it was... i will check
[08:01:01] <jomofcw> yea johnkpaul ^^ I just guess that's not what he expect :p
[08:01:20] <johnkpaul> :) yeah, jomofcw, that's definitely true
[08:01:56] <ShawnRisk> if I have a variable that is www.google.com how do I search for google in that?
[08:02:17] <jomofcw> ShawnRisk you could use regexp
[08:02:30] <jomofcw> Just give a look at it.
[08:02:41] <Godot> or indexOf()
[08:02:48] <jomofcw> johnkpaul I find his JSON valid :/.
[08:03:04] <johnkpaul> he just change dit
[08:03:09] <johnkpaul> changed it*&
[08:03:12] <johnkpaul> damn keyboard
[08:03:15] <Godot> text.indexOf("google");
[08:03:52] <w00tner> now is valid json file
[08:04:01] <ShawnRisk> I will check
[08:04:04] <w00tner> is working here: http://cuponaria.com/json/lectorjson.html
[08:04:21] <w00tner> http://cuponaria.com/json/lectorjson.html
[08:04:24] <w00tner> oops..
[08:04:43] <jomofcw> Godot I think google is just an example...
[08:04:50] <w00tner> This is the code: http://pastebin.com/NpHFayi4
[08:05:07] <jomofcw> And so w00tner your var still be undefined ?
[08:05:10] <w00tner> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ;
[08:05:17] <w00tner> @ console
[08:06:01] <w00tner> is it ok to retrieve json data like this ? var getID =  $(data.empresa);
[08:06:24] <jomofcw> try to get data.empresa first
[08:06:38] <jomofcw> You do not need to transform it in a jQuery object IMO
[08:06:48] <Godot> hmm, does the special character make any trouble?
[08:07:07] <jomofcw> It should not if right encoded.
[08:07:17] <Godot> its in a variable name
[08:07:21] <Godot> not legal or?
[08:07:55] <w00tner>   $(document).ready(function() {
[08:07:55] <w00tner>          $.getJSON('cupones.json', function(data) {
[08:07:55] <w00tner>          var getID =  $(data.empresa);
[08:07:55] <w00tner>          console.log(getID);
[08:07:55] <w00tner>          })};
[08:07:58] <w00tner> oops sorry
[08:08:01] <Godot> hehe
[08:08:01] <jomofcw> Godot doesn't mind IMO,, he just need to get the var as an array
[08:08:03] <w00tner> holy shit noobster
[08:08:18] <w00tner> i hate noobsters like me :P
[08:08:25] <jomofcw> anyway, w00tner why transforme empresa in a jQuery object ?
[08:08:30] * Godot slaps w00tner around a bit with a large trout
[08:08:30] <jomofcw> w00tner ;)
[08:08:48] <w00tner> i condemn all the years i expend learing design and marketing
[08:09:09] <jomofcw> w00tner could you just answer the question :D ?
[08:09:15] <jomofcw> And we will try to help you ^^.
[08:09:25] <Godot> so: getID = data.empresa;
[08:09:26] <jomofcw> But, in my case, I don't have the whole day to help you :x.
[08:09:36] <jomofcw> +1 Godot
[08:09:42] <w00tner> why transform it ?
[08:10:05] <w00tner> i dont want to transform it i just want to retrieve it
[08:10:17] <jomofcw> ...
[08:10:22] <Godot> no need for jquery there
[08:10:31] <jomofcw> YOU transform it in a jQuery object w00tner :D
[08:10:41] <jomofcw> warping it in a $() syntax
[08:10:53] <jomofcw> you don't need it so, follow the Godot's example.
[08:10:54] <Godot> noob $(w00tner)
[08:11:04] <w00tner> =)
[08:11:23] <w00tner> is this counter strike ?
[08:11:55] <w00tner> is not getting anything fuck it
[08:11:59] <w00tner> im gonna get high
[08:12:05] <w00tner> maybe it works
[08:12:13] <Godot> and for texting purposes I would replace √≥ with o
[08:12:19] <Godot> -x+s
[08:12:38] <jomofcw> Yea it's probably better.
[08:12:57] <jomofcw> w00tner if your JSON is Valid, and you can't get any data from it
[08:13:01] <jomofcw> the problem is in the load
[08:13:10] <Godot> hes loaded?
[08:13:11] <jomofcw> What about your request in the console ?
[08:14:20] <w00tner> i made it
[08:14:34] <w00tner> well you made it
[08:14:52] <jomofcw> We made it ;).
[08:14:54] <Godot> I ate it?
[08:14:57] <jomofcw> Good job :).
[08:16:14] <w00tner> lets dance mates!
[08:17:17] <stefuNz> hey. is there a plugin or any way to achieve this: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/593/testpbg.png/ - getting the ">" on the right side?
[08:18:02] <jedimind> css
[08:18:13] <Godot> my first try ould be css like li:after{}
[08:18:20] <jomofcw> css background on the option element
[08:18:41] <jomofcw> It look like a select element, not a UL, but dunno...
[08:18:59] <stefuNz> yes. it's a <select multple>
[08:19:07] <stefuNz> checking if a background-image can be set. hold on
[08:19:44] <stefuNz> nope. cannot be set
[08:20:17] <stefuNz> arr so i need to convert it to an ul / li construct.
[08:20:23] <jedimind> yup
[08:20:28] <jedimind> luckily, i just wrote an article on how to do that
[08:20:38] <jedimind> http://bnotions.com/form-select-replacement-using-jquery-css/
[08:20:40] <jedimind> ta-daa
[08:21:20] <Godot> hehehe
[08:21:25] <stefuNz> :)
[08:21:38] <Godot> option:after might work too but list is nicer :-)
[08:21:39] <Gx4> how to load file contents into variable ?
[08:22:03] <Gx4> var $test = load('url') ?
[08:22:18] <jedimind> Godot, cannot do :after on input elments
[08:22:21] <jedimind> or any subset of such
[08:22:25] <jedimind> only <button>
[08:22:40] <stefuNz> Godot: can you give me some information about what you mean with option:after {} ?
[08:23:09] <jedimind> inputs are whats called replaced elements
[08:23:11] <jedimind> stefuNz, it wont work
[08:23:18] <stefuNz> :D
[08:23:19] <jedimind> replaced elements do not support :before or :after
[08:23:56] <jedimind> but, what he's referring to is a CSS3 pseudo selector :before or :after which allow you to add additional content to your elements
[08:24:07] <stefuNz> oh i see
[08:24:08] <jedimind> ul li:after { content: " > "; }
[08:24:10] <jedimind> for example
[08:24:15] <jedimind> will add a > at the end of each LI
[08:24:22] <Godot> you would need to escape the >
[08:24:31] <jedimind> well, yeah
[08:24:41] <Haprog> no
[08:24:41] <jomofcw> Gx4 you need to use the .ajax() method then catch and init var in the success callback
[08:24:44] <jedimind> not the greatest example
[08:25:16] <Haprog> CSS content property automatically escapes everything. You can't put HTML in there.
[08:26:26] <ShawnRisk> If I am using videourl = $(e.currentTarget).attr('href'); how do I get the google in www.google.com?
[08:26:28] <Godot> you want text, not html
[08:26:58] <silverwind> ShawnRisk: A regex
[08:27:05] <ShawnRisk> okay
[08:28:53] <ShawnRisk> silverwind: how?
[08:29:05] <BBJames> ls
[08:29:27] <Godot> hehe
[08:29:37] <silverwind> ls: command not found
[08:29:40] <silverwind> #
[08:30:01] <BBJames> Haha, just instinct told me to look see whats here
[08:30:05] <w00nzs> lets make a mirc script
[08:30:06] <Godot> Shawn: Do you just want to know, wheter its in the URL?
[08:30:08] <w00nzs> lol
[08:30:24] <Godot> +h
[08:30:42] <w00nzs> /alias yes /say i am a jax0r or what ?
[08:30:42] <b-ot> w00nzs, I am not in i.
[08:30:44] <w00nzs> i am a jax0r or what ?
[08:30:50] <w00nzs> hahaha
[08:31:25] <BBJames> What set do I need to do here to make var price = jQuery(this).find('.item-vat').val(); price = '¬£' + price.toFixed(2)
[08:31:26] <BBJames> work
[08:31:46] <ShawnRisk> Godot: I want to know if it is in the URL and store this.  If I have www.google.com or www.yahoo.com, the same variable will tell me that.
[08:32:13] <BBJames> Normally I would do parseint but that makes it a while number doesn't it?
[08:32:23] <BBJames> step*
[08:32:30] <silverwind> BBJames: Then use parseFloat
[08:32:38] <Godot> then still url.indexOf("google")
[08:32:44] <BBJames> thats the one silver wind thanks
[08:33:10] <Godot> test for -1
[08:34:19] <ShawnRisk> Godot: yes but I would need two different ones, one for google and another for yahoo.  How can I do this automatically so if the url is anything it will catch that?
[08:35:15] <Godot> with regex you can do it in one step, but probably still worse performance than two indexOf
[08:35:43] <ShawnRisk> Godot: yes but I am not sure how many there could be, this is just the start
[08:36:00] <ShawnRisk> Godot: can you show me the code with regex because I am confused a bit
[08:36:49] <Godot> then something like url.match(/(google|yahoo/)
[08:37:39] <ShawnRisk> Godot: oh my, how do I do this in one step with regex?
[08:38:09] <silverwind> ?js /\.(.+)\..+$/.exec("www.google.com");
[08:38:22] <silverwind> Shit bot..
[08:39:10] <ShawnRisk> let me test that
[08:39:21] <Godot> hehe
[08:39:24] <ShawnRisk> wait
[08:39:41] <ShawnRisk> exec would execute the url
[08:39:50] <silverwind> Are you trolling?
[08:40:02] <ShawnRisk> me no
[08:40:08] <Godot> http://de.selfhtml.org/javascript/objekte/string.htm#match
[08:40:14] <silverwind> I know it's trolling friday... but..
[08:40:36] <Godot> oops german
[08:40:51] <silverwind> MDN is your friend.
[08:41:12] <silverwind> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[08:41:44] <w00nzs> ich m√∂chte ein biar vitte sch√∂n
[08:41:50] <w00nzs> can i go to germany now ?
[08:42:00] * Godot serves w00nzs a cold one
[08:42:16] <esdf> any examples of jquery apps that poll twitch tv status?
[08:42:20] * Godot only reads British English
[08:42:30] <w00nzs> are you harry potter ?
[08:42:39] <w00nzs> i just read mexican english
[08:42:43] <w00nzs> oh wait..
[08:43:40] <w00nzs> ok back to work. so if i want to create a listview, with json objects. do i use "each"?
[08:44:09] <w00nzs> but first i have to filter the object depending of the category. so that the argument?
[08:44:35] <masak> the thing where a text appears in an empty <input>, and disappears when the <input> is given focus, and reappears when it loses it... how do people normally do that with jQuery or jQuery UI?
[08:44:59] <w00nzs> im just want to confirm so i can read about it, i dont want the answer =)
[08:45:12] <w00nzs> to know if i am in th eright track with the looping
[08:47:14] <Godot> masak: I believe jquery, but dont really know
[08:49:42] <masak> hm. so there's nothing pre-built for this? people just use .focus and .blur?
[08:50:37] <masak> oh wait! HTML5 has something called placeholders...
[08:50:46] <esdf> any examples of jquery code that poll twitch tv status, embeds the stream on live status etc?
[08:50:55] <EdwardIII> masak: checkout placeholder
[08:51:02] <EdwardIII> masak: and jquery placeholder polyfill perhaps?
[08:52:13] <masak> ooh
[08:52:58] <EdwardIII> masak: and if you're interested in that maybe have a look at modernizr to turn the placeholder polyfill on when the browser is lacking
[08:53:36] <EdwardIII> and figure out how the make the placeholder polyfill place nice with jquery validate, and then tell me heh
[08:53:43] <jedimind> if im not mistaken, the actual "jquery placehodler polyfill" has a custom build of modernizr implemented in it
[08:53:49] <jedimind> jquery validate... ugh
[08:53:56] <jedimind> hate that plugin
[08:53:56] <EdwardIII> jedimind: not that i've seen
[08:54:01] <EdwardIII> jedimind: preferable alternative?
[08:54:04] <jedimind> my own
[08:54:04] <jedimind> :)
[08:54:08] <EdwardIII> FOSS?
[08:54:10] <jedimind> http://projects.pud.ca/validajtor/
[08:54:17] <EdwardIII> EXCELLENTE
[08:54:32] <jedimind> i have a newer version of it too if youre interested in using it i'll link you to the github
[08:54:56] <jedimind> i wrote it a little while ago so it uses a custom data- attribute; but ive been meaning to refactor it to be a polyfill for html5 validation
[08:55:36] <evasivx> jedimind, hey man, just wanted to say hi. IT's "polorix" from a long time ago. Hope you're doing well
[08:55:51] <jedimind> hey brother, happy to see you
[08:56:31] <evasivx> :) How has everything been?
[08:56:54] <evasivx> Are you developing more now?
[08:57:15] <jedimind> yeah, i suppose i am, im still leading teams, but doing some more open source type of development
[08:57:25] <jedimind> plugins and things like that, not necessarily so much project specific stuff
[08:58:00] <LindsayMac> jedimind is just overall kicking ass and taking names. 'nough said
[08:58:09] <evasivx> ahhh nice! Well thats cool. I'm now the lead developer and designer here now, which is cool. Pretty much more stress with a flashier business card haha
[08:58:12] <clocKwize> guys, I want to slideIn/slideOut depending on a boolean, how would I do that? (other than an if statement)
[08:58:27] <evasivx> LindsayMac, it must be hard for him to be so awesome
[08:58:40] <Brodingo> clocKwize are you aware of slideToggle() ?
[08:58:41] <jedimind> actually, it comes uite naturally
[08:58:42] <jedimind> :)
[08:58:45] <jedimind> quite*
[08:58:46] <jedimind> fail.
[08:58:51] <LindsayMac> LOL
[08:58:59] <evasivx> He just wakes up to a full cup of fabulous
[08:59:01] <clocKwize> Brodingo: yes, it does't take a boolean though? it just toggles the opposite of what it currently is
[08:59:07] <evasivx> wait awesome* fabulous if you were gay
[08:59:20] <evasivx> jedimind, do you like boys?
[08:59:22] <evasivx> xD
[09:00:13] <Brodingo> clocKwize correct
[09:00:21] <clocKwize> thats not what I want then :D
[09:00:42] <Brodingo> and youre wanting something chainable
[09:00:44] <LindsayMac> hahahah evasivx
[09:00:52] <evasivx> ;D
[09:01:11] <jedimind> evasivx, haha, yes, i wake up every morning and just shout "FABULOUS"
[09:01:52] <evasivx> hahahah i knew it!
[09:03:21] <LindsayMac> Chrome has been plotting against me since i first tried to install it.
[09:03:42] <Brodingo> LindsayMac flash might be crashing, that was happening to me the other day
[09:03:55] <LindsayMac> Brodingo:  i can't even get it to DOWNLOAD!
[09:04:04] <LindsayMac> i get an error "file could not be saved to /downloads/"
[09:04:14] <LindsayMac> so i switched it to desktop and downlaoded it.. and it was corrupt
[09:04:20] <Brodingo> dafuq
[09:04:30] <LindsayMac> right
[09:04:30] <jedimind> LindsayMac, so you're the one person in the world who has trouble installing chrome
[09:04:45] <ravenzz> Brodingo you can solve that issue actually
[09:04:51] <LindsayMac> Not to mention i HAD it installed but when it was installed then, i was getting "Aw,Snap" every site i go to
[09:05:04] <Brodingo> ravenzz by uninstalling?
[09:05:10] <ravenzz> no
[09:05:33] <ravenzz> chrome://plugins/
[09:05:40] <ravenzz> disable it
[09:05:46] <masak> found https://github.com/danielstocks/jQuery-Placeholder
[09:05:54] <LindsayMac> ravenzz:  why would you disable flash on chrome?
[09:06:06] <masak> but I actually think I'm quite fine with just HTML5 attribute, and screw older browsers.
[09:06:15] <evasivx> IF it wasn't for firebug and sync i'd probably abandon Firefox. NO FIREFOX! No i don't think it's ok to use 1.5gb of ram just because 8 tabs have flash based advertisements!
[09:06:39] <ravenzz> LindsayMac you won't, the thing is that Chrome has its built in flash plugin, and it would conflict with the one you use to install
[09:06:50] <LindsayMac> ahhhh interesting
[09:07:12] <LindsayMac> evasivx:  there's Ad Blocker plugins for that too?
[09:07:35] <LindsayMac> Ohh seems like i FINALLY got chrome running smoothly on my machine
[09:07:56] <clocKwize> chrome rocks
[09:07:59] <clocKwize> and i use it for everything
[09:08:00] <ravenzz> masak usually I include that plugin only for legacy browsers
[09:08:08] <ravenzz> just use a conditional comment
[09:08:14] <evasivx> LindsayMac, oh of course i use AdblockPlus. But it doesn't change the fact that Firefox is a beastly girl who hogs resources
[09:08:26] <evasivx> memory leaks...memory leaks everywhere
[09:08:29] <LindsayMac> hahaha true true
[09:08:58] <LindsayMac> i suppose i'm used to memory leaks and found it a necessary evil.. seeing as I could not get chrome installed and I use Adobe products regularly (terrible memory leaks)
[09:08:58] <ravenzz> ff is damn slow on my laptop
[09:10:07] <LindsayMac> Well.. im psyched to FINALLY have chrome
[09:10:10] <LindsayMac> yay for timeline
[09:10:30] <evasivx> yay!
[09:10:51] <evasivx> Honestly, the only browser that i would consider to be on top of...everything. Would be Opera, most underated browser ever
[09:11:59] <LindsayMac> Huh.. looking at my site on timeline, it SEEMS as though its not as bad as I thought it might be
[09:12:20] <Brodingo> operas got some first class dev tools
[09:12:32] <Brodingo> i prefer chrome but theyre definitely second best
[09:13:02] <evasivx> Is it just me or is IE9's javascript engine 300% faster than firefoxes and 20% faster than chromes?
[09:13:27] <evasivx> Animations and such, on low end hardware, run waaaay smoother in IE9 than anything else
[09:13:49] <evasivx> Firefox's
[09:13:55] <evasivx> Chrome's
[09:15:12] <LindsayMac> now i just need to understand what I am looking at in timeline
[09:15:30] <LindsayMac> What is "Timer Fired" and "install Timer" ?
[09:25:07] <LindsayMac> ugh maybe i didnt want to see my site in chrome!
[09:25:28] <zeen> can anyone recommend some sort of daisy chaining/queueing plugin?
[09:25:46] <LindsayMac> for animations?
[09:25:56] <zeen> ajax
[09:26:03] <ryanneufeld> zeen: Deferreds
[09:26:08] <ryanneufeld> zeen: and they are built in
[09:26:18] <ryanneufeld> zeen see ?Deferred
[09:26:25] <ryanneufeld> or not
[09:26:39] <zeen> found it in the jquery docs.. having a look now, thanks
[09:26:43] <ryanneufeld> zeen: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[09:27:14] <zeen> new to me, thanks a lot
[09:27:20] <ryanneufeld> np
[09:27:32] <johnkpaul> zeen: this might also be useful http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-1-7s-callbacks-feature-demystified/
[09:27:57] <ryanneufeld> zeen: also the slides from Alex McPherson are great if you have keynote
[09:27:58] <ryanneufeld> http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/
[09:28:18] <po0dle> After emptying an element of child elements and appending new one's, could it be that event listeners don't work on these new children?
[09:28:27] <LindsayMac> There's this weird thing with a fixed background image where it jumps 2-3 pixels just as scrolling is stopped..
[09:28:44] <johnkpaul> po0dle: yes, adding event handlers directly to elements, if you remove those elements, those handlers will no longer fire
[09:28:54] <johnkpaul> ?delegate @ po0dle
[09:29:21] <po0dle> I get nothing
[09:30:48] <johnkpaul> sorry po0dle, bot's not working, google for jquery delegate
[09:32:38] <po0dle> Why is this behaviour johnkpaul ?
[09:33:02] <johnkpaul> po0dle: you are adding an event handler to element that you destroyed with .empty()
[09:33:12] <johnkpaul> so that event handler can no longer fire
[09:33:43] <po0dle> Yeah but I created new elements right?
[09:34:02] <johnkpaul> but you didn't add the handlers again
[09:35:01] <po0dle> Does this have to happen even if you use a selector?
[09:35:32] <po0dle> $('table#itemSchema tbody tr').hover(function(){
[09:36:35] <po0dle> If this makes some sense johnkpaul
[09:36:59] <johnkpaul> po0dle: yes, I think you want delegate
[09:37:02] <johnkpaul> did you look at those docs?
[09:37:33] <po0dle> It says delegate is deprecated btw
[09:37:50] <shoky> no it doesn't
[09:38:39] <po0dle> As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method. For earlier versions, however, it remains the most effective means to use event delegation.
[09:39:00] <shoky> yeah, .delegate just calls .on (switching the first 2 arguments)
[09:39:02] <lduros> setting  the disabled attribute to nothing $("input").attr("disabled", ""); won't enable it right? You have to remove the attribute?
[09:39:06] <shoky> but it's not deprecated
[09:39:13] <lduros> this is useless code, correct? >> $("input").attr("disabled", "");
[09:39:41] <ktstowell> why not use removeAttr
[09:39:48] <lduros> yeh, that's what I want to do
[09:39:53] <lduros> but I see this in a file that I didn't write
[09:39:54] <po0dle> .removeAttr()
[09:39:57] <rocky> hrm, does anyone know if there's a jquery plugin for doing the most common operations with a hashbang url ?
[09:40:02] <rocky> (ie setting, getting, detecting changes, etc)
[09:40:03] <shoky> lduros: i use  .prop("disabled",false)
[09:40:26] <lduros> but I wanted to make sure this has _no effect_ to enable the input
[09:40:31] <shoky> then go test it
[09:40:32] <lduros> because I see it maybe 20 times in the code
[09:40:38] <lduros> shoky: I did, it doesn't seem to enable it
[09:40:49] <lduros> unless you remove the entire attribute
[09:41:08] <lduros> hmm
[09:41:12] <lduros> it did that's weird
[09:41:16] <lduros> it's jquery magic then
[09:41:51] <lduros> with javascript it won't be enabled unless you remove the attribute
[09:41:56] <lduros> but that line does just that
[09:43:26] <ravenzz> are the videos from the last jquery conf online?
[09:44:17] <ajpiano> ravenzz: the keynotes are, the rest are coming ! http://confreaks.com/events/jqcon2012
[09:44:30] <ravenzz> <3
[09:44:31] <ravenzz> thank you
[09:45:03] <shoky> lduros: i think that setting .attr('disabled','')  _used to_ work
[09:45:42] <williamson37015> 'loadScripts' : function() {  	var jqueryDirectory = "http://localhost/tutorialway/resources/js"  	$.rloader({ src : ''+ jqueryDirectory +'/ui/jquery.mousewheel.js', callback:mousewheel });  	mousewheel function() { console.log('jquery.mousewheel.js is loaded') });   	}
[09:45:50] <brettfrable> could someone guide me into what I'm doing wrong here
[09:45:50] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/G9CpG/
[09:46:10] <mattk_> there's no markup
[09:46:15] <williamson37015> @brettfrable what are you trying th do?
[09:46:38] <kvikende> hello. need some help with $.with(). I have the case where i want the postcalls for func1 and func2 to be completed before running func3, when func1 is completed run func4, and when func4 and func2 is completed run func5. yet any function must only be run once
[09:46:46] <brettfrable> if the div is main - do this / else if the div is main-no-lightbox do this
[09:47:20] <mattk_> first, you're missing closing parenthesis
[09:47:21] <mattk_> if($("#main"){
[09:47:21] <shoky> lduros: yeah with <1.6 it worked, before there was .prop
[09:47:22] <po0dle> Cool that worked johnkpaul ! Thanks
[09:47:25] <mattk_> should be if($("#main")){
[09:47:37] <johnkpaul> no problem po0dle
[09:47:49] <mattk_> second, you should be checking the length of it to see if it exists
[09:48:01] <mattk_> if( $("#main").length ) { ... then
[09:48:28] <mattk_> also, if you're going to do main.empty().append(), why not just do main.html();
[09:49:03] <brettfrable> .length
[09:49:07] <brettfrable> or .length()
[09:49:17] <mattk_> should just be .length i believe
[09:49:32] <mattk_> yeah, just the property
[09:49:35] <williamson37015> Can someone help with this http://jsfiddle.net/G9CpG/
[09:49:57] <mattk_> are you guys spamming or something?
[09:49:59] <mattk_> thats teh same example
[09:50:14] <williamson37015> I keep recieving an erro Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier on jquery.configuration.js:55
[09:50:24] <lduros> shoky: AH! Yeh that's what I just noticed :-)
[09:51:43] <williamson37015> WHOOPs sorry http://jsfiddle.net/williamson37015/AeSBS/
[09:51:54] <williamson37015> I keep recieving an erro Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier on jquery.configuration.js:55
[09:53:35] <mattk_> well first of all, your conlog1 function is all messed up
[09:53:50] <mattk_> it should be function conlog1() { ... }
[09:54:03] <mattk_> second, you are closing it with a parenthesis
[09:54:09] <mattk_> });
[09:54:20] <mattk_> its a regular function in a closure, so it should be closed with just a bracket.   };
[09:54:46] <mattk_> your scope is all busted with brackets too, looks like a copy/paste error
[09:55:43] <williamson37015> Thank You
[09:56:22] <kvikende> http://jsfiddle.net/vXh2d/ i am trying to do that, but i dont want func2(par) to be run twice
[09:56:28] <kvikende> any ideas how to do that?
[09:57:04] <mattk_> williamson37015: this resolves some of your scope stuff http://jsfiddle.net/AeSBS/1/
[09:57:18] <williamson37015> Ok, I'm checking it out
[09:59:22] <williamson37015> Thank you so much it worked
[09:59:39] <mattk_> ;)
[10:01:45] <williamson37015> I've been working with jquery for almost a year now, it's been quite an adventure. I was wondering is there a way I can detect whether a function has been fired?
[10:02:01] <mattk_> eh, well it'd be event handling
[10:02:07] <mattk_> or using deferred.. it really depends on what you're doing
[10:02:22] <mattk_> kvikende: i'm running this script and my output goes like
[10:02:34] <mattk_> 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 4, 5
[10:02:37] <mattk_> that seems to be expected
[10:02:43] <mattk_> your last line is $.when(func2(par), func4()).done(func5());
[10:02:46] <mattk_> thats one func2
[10:02:51] <mattk_> your first set is $.when(func1(par)).then(func2(par)).done(func3());
[10:02:56] <mattk_> which has func2 in it also
[10:02:59] <mattk_> so that's your two calls
[10:05:05] <kvikende> mattk_: thanks for looking at it. i'm not experienced/smart enough to make that work in such a way that only once is each function run. ie. i'd like to "share" the promise(?) such that each function is only run once yet that dependency is held
[10:05:19] <Jagan_> hi........ I have One Parent div, that 50 children div.. I have to display 10 at a time. hw to display?
[10:06:36] <mattk_> i think i'm a little confused on what you're trying to accomplish kvikende. You have func1, 2, 3, 4, 5. How do you want them to fire? In what order?
[10:06:51] <mattk_> since the code is so generic and demo, it's hard to tell what you're really trying to accomplish
[10:08:04] <williamson37015> This is really frustrating me, I have a Unordered list with 7 (Their My Recents Tweets) List Items, I want to use jQuery to cycle throught them then go backto the beginning how would do that?
[10:10:59] <kvikende> mattk_: true. the dependency is such: creating quote and bundle has no dependencies. creating a product is dependent on first creating a quote. creating a relation between quote and bundle is dependent on creating quote and bundle. creating a relation between product and bundle is dependent on creating a product and a bundle. each must be a post-request thus async.
[10:11:52] <MistuhKurtz> williamson37015, you can use the jQuery cycle plugin
[10:12:27] <Mohsen_Hassani> Have you guys worked with apycom jquery menus? My problem is that when the page is being post back, the selected menu looses focus
[10:12:37] <williamson37015> I would prefer to code it custom made, is there an suggestion on how to do it?
[10:13:06] <TrentonDAdams> Hey guys.  I'm seeing a problem where if I do two ajax calls very close together, my "loading" gif doesn't disappear afterward.
[10:13:23] <TrentonDAdams> I'm using global ajaxStart and ajaxStop functionality.
[10:14:16] <MistuhKurtz> well, set a interval timer williamson37015, and each time have it remove an 'active' class from the current list item being displayed, and add the 'active' class to the next sibling
[10:14:42] <williamson37015> Here I'll make a js Fiddle to show it.
[10:14:48] <TrentonDAdams> Oh, and all I'm doing for the loading icon, is a show/hide.
[10:15:01] <MistuhKurtz> obv. you can take it much further with animations and whatnot but I think that may suffice is a good enough base
[10:15:20] <MistuhKurtz> I always prefer to use plugins and extend them via callbacks etc. whenever possible, though
[10:15:38] <mattk_> plugins are bulky
[10:15:39] <mattk_> often
[10:15:53] <MistuhKurtz> *mature, well-vetted plugins
[10:16:33] <TrentonDAdams> Here is my jquery code http://jsfiddle.net/dymRZ/
[10:17:31] <MistuhKurtz> of course just writing your own from scratch works great too oftentimes
[10:17:55] <williamson37015> MistuhKurtz http://jsfiddle.net/williamson37015/ECt6r/
[10:18:01] <MistuhKurtz> but for something like that, jquery cycle lite just makes sense to hammer it out really quickly
[10:18:05] <williamson37015> Any Suggestions?
[10:18:25] <MistuhKurtz> first of all you might want to populate that with content
[10:18:49] <williamson37015> >
[10:18:50] <MistuhKurtz> and the bare minimum of CSS
[10:18:51] <williamson37015> ?
[10:19:03] <MistuhKurtz> there's no text in the <li>...</li>
[10:19:53] <williamson37015> Ok MistuhKurtz on second then.
[10:20:02] <MistuhKurtz> second of all, I suggested setting an interval timer to fire a function every x milliseconds for you to get started...I'll be glad to help when & if you get stuck though :)
[10:21:32] <TrentonDAdams> hmm, it seems to be some sort of synchronizations issue.  if I don't use the fadein, but instead the show(), it works just fine.  So, it seems almost as if the ajaxStop is being called prior to the fadein being finished.
[10:23:34] <williamson37015> MistuhKirtz refresh the Fiddle
[10:24:59] <TrentonDAdams> yep, that's it, the fadein complete callback is called after the ajaxStop.
[10:25:05] <TrentonDAdams> So, it would seem I should file a bug?
[10:27:28] <MistuhKurtz> williamson37015, when you update the fiddle it changes the URL
[10:27:36] <williamson37015> ah
[10:28:29] <williamson37015> http://jsfiddle.net/williamson37015/ECt6r/

[10:28:48] <williamson37015> sorry
[10:36:29] <kvikende> I've come closer to my goal, i just need some help with $.when chaining (pipe i guess). What I want: when createQuote(), createBundle() is complete, run relateQuoteAndBundle() and createProduct(). when createProduct() is complete run relateBundleAndProduct()
[10:37:09] <mattk_> williamson37015: http://jsfiddle.net/ECt6r/5/
[10:37:20] <MistuhKurtz> williamson37015, http://jsfiddle.net/ECt6r/6/
[10:37:23] <mattk_> its not the most elegant, but i think thats what you were going for

[10:37:31] <BFranks> Hmmm I
[10:38:33] <SidGBF> There's a onclick event on a link/button. I want to add a function to run BEFORE this one. How to do that?

[10:40:16] <williamson37015> Thanks it works well!
[10:41:17] <dabear> wasn't access to .data('events') removed in jquery 1.8?
[10:41:28] <SidGBF> mattk_: Well, jquery guys are smarter than me. Actually this function will have a confirm and only if the user confirm the previous event should be called
[10:41:32] <MistuhKurtz> obv. you can use fadeOut and fadeIn or other animation methods instead of simply adding/removing classes williamson37015
[10:41:42] <williamson37015> ok.
[10:41:43] <BFranks> hate my KB's enter key.. AND I am trying to get the .find() function to highlight items in a textinput .. sadly I can't find any way to increment it so it will skip the last thing it found and move ahead.. Jquery .find is for finding child elements .. with no examples of using it like JS .find()
[10:41:52] <MistuhKurtz> but then you would want to do the fadeIn one inside of the callback for fadeOut, to make sure it executes in proper order
[10:42:08] <mattk_> dabear: they did remove something, but i think they left the ability to access open
[10:42:32] <mattk_> This is now removed in 1.8, but you can still get to the events data for debugging purposes via $._data(element, "events"). Note that this is not a supported public interface; the actual data structures may change incompatibly from version to version.
[10:42:48] <mattk_> so it's not recommended, but still exists
[10:43:08] <mattk_> but you know. if you're not using 1.8 and dont plan to.. then it's irrelevant anyway
[10:43:20] <mattk_> upgrading is always good, but if your product works fine as-is and doesn't need the new features.. why upgrade?
[10:45:42] <dispy> Hi. Where can I find information about what columns the file-object passed by jquery upload provides? It's not stated in the documentation
[10:46:03] <forceblast> I'm trying to use jQuery UI 1.8.22 with jQuery 1.8.0.  I'm still seeing a lot of references to .curCSS() in the jQuery UI code.  As far as I can tell this function was removed in jQuery 1.8.0 in favor of .css().  I had to actually alias the function myself to get things working again.  Is this a known issue?
[10:48:25] <MistuhKurtz> mattk_, because the upgrade seems to largely be about optimization and bugfixes?
[10:49:24] <mattk_> ha yeah. but for 90% of websites, it hardly matters unless you're using things that were broken or slow
[10:49:43] <mattk_> if you're doing a basic site that just fadeIn(), selectors, and iterations.. it really doesn't matter that you save the 50ms when you only have 1000 visitors
[10:50:29] <mattk_> if you're using code thats going to deprecated or you're doing heavy DOM animations and transitions and stuff that would be affected by selector speedup and need it to run on very poor computers.. then sure. but that's rarely the case
[10:52:21] <MistuhKurtz> I would argue that speed optimization is almost always beneficial to user experience...now I'm not going to run around to each of my clients' websites just to update jquery but if I'm already in there, then why the hell not?
[10:53:03] <mattk_> well forceblast is saying he has to go through hoops to get UI working with 1.8 because of some compatibility issues or something.
[10:53:19] <mattk_> and my answer is, unless you need all those new 1.8 features, just downgrade to the previous version. it's really not going to hurt you that much.
[10:53:27] <mattk_> if 1.8 didn't come out today, you'd be using it anyway
[10:53:49] <mattk_> (the previous version i mean)
[10:55:53] <beefz0r> what is wrong about my code ?  $(".check").each(function(index,el){$(".check")[index].attr("checked");});
[10:55:59] <MistuhKurtz> Oh well in that case yes, it's pretty obvious, wait until jquery UI compatability  :)
[10:56:28] <mattk_> beez0r, you dont need $check[index]
[10:56:32] <mattk_> just
[10:56:35] <mattk_> el.attr('checked')
[10:57:02] <mattk_> and IF you wanted to use index for whatever reason.. you'd do   $('.check').eq(index).attr('checked')
[10:57:24] <mattk_> not advisable though because it goes through another selector for each that it has already traversed through
[10:57:30] <beefz0r> this is my new code, but it doesn't wor k?
[10:57:30] <beefz0r> $(".check").each(function(index,el){jQuery(el).attr("checked");});
[10:58:24] <danzik171> beefz0r: use prop for rather than attr for getting / setting the checked attribute.  also, your statement doesn't do anything, just fetches the current value of "checked", but doesn't use it in any way or store it anywhere
[10:58:32] <mattk_> well attr, doesnt do anything
[10:58:36] <mattk_> are you trying to check it?
[10:58:41] <MistuhKurtz> you should use $(this).attr('checked', 'checked');
[10:58:45] <beefz0r> oh okay
[10:58:46] <MistuhKurtz> if you want to check it
[10:58:54] <beefz0r> I'm quite new to jquery :-)
[10:59:04] <MistuhKurtz> ?attr @ beefz0r
[10:59:13] <MistuhKurtz> damn how does that bot work
[10:59:13] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[10:59:21] <MistuhKurtz> ?.attr
[10:59:45] <forceblast> mattk_: I'm just trying the new version.  Yes, I will downgrade if I run into any serious issues.  So far this was my only snag.  I was just trying to see if what I was experiencing was common knowledge.
[10:59:45] <beefz0r> well believe it or not, .attr("checked","checked") was my first code
[11:00:00] <beefz0r> no idea why I changed it
[11:00:07] <forceblast> I'll take a look around and report a bug if needed.
[11:00:22] <mattk_> forceblast: i'm not personally too familiar with it and the UI to say. Was just having a mini debate about reasons to upgrade
[11:00:27] <mattk_> and when not to
[11:00:38] <forceblast> gotcha
[11:00:51] <danzik171> MistuhKurtz: no, use .prop( "checked", true ) - the DOM property is more correct.  http://timmywillison.com/2011/When-to-use-.attr()-and-.prop().html
[11:01:16] <forceblast> Whenever a new version of any of my toys come out I must at least play with them on a dev sandbox.  ;-)
[11:02:04] <sbfds> if i include a script file as the last element in my index.html, is it the same as enclosing it all in a $(function(){   });?
[11:02:24] <Raydiation> any idea why mouseleave on the div always returns undefined on the data attributes http://jsfiddle.net/amgX7/
[11:02:52] <mattk_> danzik171: interesting article
[11:03:00] <beefz0r> jquery should be built in in all browsers, it makes javascripting much more fun
[11:04:11] <mattk_> Raydiation: http://jsfiddle.net/amgX7/1/
[11:04:17] <mattk_> see the $(this).data(...)
[11:04:26] <Raydiation> mattk_: i see ty
[11:05:17] <BFranks> Can jQuery take this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/GAmWV/22/  .. and make it so that clicking on the search phrases at the bottom will cycle through the available matches? .. Ie: click once to find, click a second time to find-next.. ?
[11:11:18] <mattk_> object.find ([textToFind [, matchCase[, searchUpward[, wrapAround[, wholeWord[, searchInFrames[, showDialog]]]]]]]);
[11:18:00] <SoulRaven> hello
[11:18:29] <SoulRaven> is posibile to filter what data will be put in a div, from a ajax callback
[11:18:39] <mattk_> BFranks:
[11:18:53] <mattk_> I think the problem you're having is that you're using spans as click actions
[11:19:04] <BFranks> mattk_: That's the method I am using with http://jsfiddle.net/GAmWV/23/  ... I guess I could narrow down the object but that's still not going to help with the problem of advancing to the next found object.. ?
[11:19:06] <mattk_> and when you click on them, it sets a cursor position which is where it searches from
[11:19:09] <williamson37015> mattk, I'm going off of your method for the cycle throught the list items, how would I fade the list item out before i fade it in?
[11:19:19] <mattk_> If you use buttons, i think it works (strange, i know)
[11:19:21] <SoulRaven> i mean, i want selectiv to put or extract from data that will be in .html(data)
[11:20:23] <BFranks> mattk_: works worse with buttons? http://jsfiddle.net/GAmWV/29/  (I am only supporting webkit/chrome)
[11:20:35] <mattk_> williamson37015: if you want to fade them, you either have to use css animations or fadeIn/fadeOut. I say that because I know before you were using classes
[11:20:40] <williamson37015> http://jsfiddle.net/williamson37015/ECt6r/8/
[11:21:19] <mattk_> ah BFranks i had altered it a bit for testing, so thats why it seemed tow ork http://jsfiddle.net/9KJsT/
[11:21:28] <mattk_> never used the window.find before cause of browser support
[11:21:43] <mattk_> I think you'd have to do an external function call, like.. myFindMethod()
[11:21:50] <mattk_> that would set cursor position first, then do window find
[11:23:06] <BFranks> Ahhh yeah your example without passing parameters is interesting in that it's got the functionality I wanted when I specified parameters.. ;)
[11:23:46] <mattk_> yeah, i think it's about where you have currently selected on the DOM. so when you're clicking your spans, it sets caret position there.. then searches upward from there
[11:23:57] <mattk_> and it keeps highlighting the same/last term because you click and reset.. then search
[11:24:01] <mattk_> click and reset, then search again
[11:24:08] <mattk_> (as far as I can tell)
[11:24:20] <mattk_> williamson37015: checking it now
[11:24:25] <williamson37015> ok
[11:24:30] <BFranks> Sadly one of the parameters (whole word) is crucial to the process (as crucial as find next) so I can't call it without parameters.. Grrr..
[11:25:10] <BFranks> Unless I can pass that parameter as a default, then call it without parameters .. hmmm.. ?
[11:25:57] <BFranks> http://jsfiddle.net/9KJsT/5/ is an example of where 'whole word' becomes an issue..
[11:28:24] <LindsayMac> BFranks:  include a space before and after the work you are searching
[11:28:27] <brettfrable> can someone help me with this
[11:28:28] <brettfrable> http://pastie.org/4451129
[11:28:35] <LindsayMac> This way you are searching for _lorem_
[11:28:56] <BFranks> There really should be a way to specify the window as the parent object and the textarea (LindsayMac: I don't need to make an example to show you where that breaks do I?)
[11:29:12] <BFranks> er textarea as the object to search
[11:30:02] <LindsayMac> BFranks: maybe i came in in the middle, but I saw that the issue was that when you search for ipsum it finds it in contipsumaining
[11:30:05] <LindsayMac> which is undesired
[11:30:33] <BFranks> Yep.. but skipping "Lorem" at the beginning by searching " lorem " is also broken too.. ;(
[11:30:58] <LindsayMac> BFranks:  it finds the first Lorem for me
[11:30:59] <BFranks> I did debate it as well though.. ;)
[11:31:13] <BFranks> Webkit/Chrome only for this project.. :(
[11:31:18] <LindsayMac> ohh you're saying it wont find it if you use the _lorem_ because the first one doesnt have the first space
[11:31:25] <BFranks> Yep
[11:32:04] <LindsayMac> Ahhh i see
[11:32:11] <CodesStuff> a/s/l gurrrl
[11:32:18] <CodesStuff> wat yo numbah
[11:32:30] <BFranks> Still it's applying '.find()' to the 'window' object? .. can't we be more specific?
[11:32:44] <LindsayMac> CodesStuff:  hehehe..

[11:37:39] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Hey, I have a couple of question's about the AJAX method. I'm sending something via POST but I want the scalar variable to be identical to the name of the variable in my JS. Can I make these the same name or is it going to be parsed?
[11:38:00] <CodesStuff> No, LindsayMac. Bronies worship it
[11:38:00] <rue> Which scalar?
[11:38:10] <LindsayMac> ahh ok
[11:38:30] <mattk_> this is awful
[11:38:34] <DeltaHeavy|Work> rue: Sorry if I'm misusing that word. $_POST['VARIABLENAME']
[11:38:36] <CodesStuff> I picked up some drunken noodles from this thai crackhouse looking place
[11:38:42] <mattk_> kids are idiots
[11:38:42] <DeltaHeavy|Work> VARIABLENAME = Scalar variable
[11:38:58] <CodesStuff> DeltaHeavy: FUCK ASSOCIATIVES. $_POST[0] 4 LYFE
[11:40:14] <BFranks> LindsayMac: Not sure what you mean with that "and an if word" .. Sure if ' lorem ' find() came back as false I could do a '<p>lorem' find .. but that's also going to fail.. :(
[11:40:36] <DeltaHeavy|Work> CodesStuff: Yeah but I'm talking about client side :p
[11:40:44] <DeltaHeavy|Work> It still needs a name doesn't it?
[11:41:17] <LindsayMac> BFranks:  you need to run some code that looks for the FIRST word.. let me see if I can find something. Im actually much better at the logic of things than the syntax
[11:41:21] <d4rklit3> anyone? 2 column data picker?
[11:42:25] <CodesStuff> hand-code one

[11:42:51] <sbfds> what happens when an uncaught exception is thrown?

[11:43:18] <sbfds> i have a jquery plugin that's throwing an error which I'm not willing to go into debugging.
[11:43:28] <LindsayMac> BFranks:  so basically when you FIND the word, check to see if it's first.
[11:43:31] <sbfds> CodesStuff: HAHAH!
[11:43:32] <LindsayMac> erm.... cover = blown
[11:43:44] <sbfds> it's doing what i want it to.

[11:44:49] <DrJones_> Hi all, sorry for a newbie question. Have a page with a bunch of selects that may be in different states and want to open divs corresponding to the state of each select on the page load. How can I do that?
[11:45:01] <d4rklit3> hand-code
[11:45:07] <d4rklit3> i guess i could lol
[11:45:15] <CodesStuff> yeah. would take four minutes brah
[11:45:17] <d4rklit3> or i could just reskin that one
[11:45:23] <d4rklit3> which would take 2 minutes
[11:45:26] <CodesStuff> ninja please
[11:45:28] <rue> DeltaHeavy|Work: Scalar essentially just means anything that‚Äôs not composed of other things
[11:46:19] <Woet> DrJones_: please show the code you've written yourself to try and create it
[11:46:58] <DeltaHeavy|Work> rue: I guess I was using it wrong then
[11:47:33] <DrJones_> Woet: well I don't have anything yet. Been googling on how to do it ;-(
[11:47:45] <Woet> DrJones_: okay, then come back when you wrote some code and are having issues
[11:47:54] <DeltaHeavy|Work> Why does the data field for $.ajax not use strings as the names of the identifiers? eg data: { 'name': "John", 'location': "Boston" }
[11:48:00] <DrJones_> Woet: I was expecting the .change method being called when the page loads but I guesss now

[12:04:10] <Krambiorix_> hi guys, i have a span in a div. On the div there is an event (click) and i want to put another event on the div. Is there some kinda way that the click on the div is ignored and the click on the span is just performed.
[12:04:54] <amh345> is there a method for fading text colors from one to another without user interaction?   would it be something i would place in a timer function?
[12:06:55] <Krambiorix_> i forgot it's friday evening and everyone is going out
[12:07:38] <rhoward> how can i add icons which expand on mouseover to images
[12:07:41] <rhoward> example: https://stipple.com/a#browse/photos/3298561
[12:07:51] <MistuhKurtz> amh345, you'll need the jQuery color plugin to animate colors iirc
[12:08:03] <Krambiorix_> MistuhKurtz, can you help?
[12:08:57] <MistuhKurtz> and yeah, you would probably want to use an interval timer I guess. be careful though, text colors changing constantly doesn't exactly sound like pleasant UX...unless you're on acid :P
[12:09:21] <MistuhKurtz> Krambiorix_, that is caused by event bubbling
[12:09:35] <MistuhKurtz> might do you some good to read about it. quirksmode has an excellent post explaining event bubbling
[12:09:44] <rhoward> anyone, please ?
[12:09:52] <MistuhKurtz> but in short, you just call event.stopPropagation(); on the event object
[12:10:29] <MistuhKurtz> inside the function for the span's click event handler
[12:12:48] <Krambiorix_> MistuhKurtz, http://pastebin.com/XJKTqjdt
[12:15:05] <Krambiorix_> MistuhKurtz, but that doesn't do the job
[12:15:42] <MistuhKurtz> Krambiorix_, you should use jsfiddle instead
[12:16:12] <someprimetime> say i am targeting any clicks on $('html, body')‚Ä¶. how can I not target a specific div within that?
[12:16:15] <rhoward> MistuhKurtz: could you help me please ?
[12:16:25] <Amanda1919> any ideas about good looking industrial sites that you know?
[12:16:29] <someprimetime> e.g. i want to allow clicks everywhere in the html, EXCEPT a specific div
[12:17:57] <MistuhKurtz> rhoward, you probably would want to look into a tooltip plugin
[12:18:48] <Krambiorix_> MistuhKurtz, sry, i'm new to jquery , do you see what's wrong in my code?
[12:19:13] <MistuhKurtz> Krambiorix_, set it up on jsfiddle.net
[12:20:27] <Krambiorix_> MistuhKurtz, i don't think stopPropagation is going to help me , cause the div click is called first
[12:20:48] <tyoc213> if I receive a click event on a td on a row, and I wan get a reference to the next tr row, how I do it?
[12:21:36] <Somatt> where can I find what's new in jquery 1.8 ?
[12:29:09] <m`> I saw in the announcement that jquery 1.8 adds vendor prefixes.  Is this just for property names?  Or also for values?  i.e. if I did $(x).css('transition', 'transform' + ...), will I get -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform ...?
[12:31:24] <tyoc213> what should be the diference between .data and .attr for add extra information?
[12:32:21] <sbfds> is el { margin-top: 50px; } identical to el { margin: 50px auto auto auto; } ?
[12:33:44] <tw2113> yes
[12:34:56] <jedimind> no.
[12:34:59] <jedimind> its not
[12:35:20] <jedimind> margin-top: 50px; is the same as margin: 50px 0 0 0;
[12:35:23] <jedimind> auto is different
[12:35:46] <tw2113> ah, good point
[12:35:48] <jedimind> sbfds, ^
[12:35:54] <tw2113> just checked, margin initial value is 0, i thought auto
[12:36:07] <jedimind> if it was auto, then everything would be centered on the interwebs :)
[12:36:27] <tw2113> i'd be fine with that 10 years ago

[12:41:25] <sbfds> jedimind: what does auto do?
[12:42:35] <Tak0r> hi
[12:42:49] <jedimind> auto creates equal margins on each side, so for example div {margin: 0 auto; width: 500px;} will effectively create equal margins on each side of that, and center the element
[12:43:57] <Tak0r> does anybody have a clue why i can inject items into an accordion and not into another on the same page ?

[13:14:56] <coder7of9> jquery is bombing on $('#mysleectid option:selected').val()   is it a jquery bug??
[13:15:05] <coder7of9> this is in IE9
[13:15:36] <tw2113> have you tested it in other browsers?
[13:15:44] <coder7of9> yes ok in others
[13:16:02] <tw2113> then i'd blame IE for sucking on another thing
[13:16:18] <coder7of9> well it is jquery internal code?
[13:16:21] <coder7of9> maybe IE
[13:16:40] <coder7of9> but i would like to know if anyine has noticed. fixed worked around this
[13:16:46] <coder7of9> *anyone
[13:16:48] <SoulRaven> how can i remove a DIV from a ajax callback data?
[13:16:59] <SoulRaven> i want to remove before to use .html(data)
[13:17:36] <SoulRaven> is posibile?
[13:18:05] <coder7of9> you could use regex
[13:19:01] <coder7of9> hmtl.replace(/<div id='xxx'.*</div>/,'')
[13:19:11] <coder7of9> but maybe there is a jquery solution
[13:19:26] <SoulRaven> i have trayed with remove, but is not working
[13:26:32] <SoulRaven> is not working with data.replace(/<div class='timeToolBar'.*<\/div>/,'')
[13:26:39] <SoulRaven> i don't know way
[13:47:19] <ryanneufeld> anyone else here find their shirt from the SF conf this year makes them itchy?
[13:49:31] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: the guy in that video at 0:39 .... http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3kb8kheql1rqfhi2o1_250.gif
[13:52:38] <drewh> how do I add 'this' into a selector?
[13:52:44] <jita> Is there a way to find declared object in the webpage. Like i have a object foo whose value is declared in document {'a': 1, 'b':2}, can i find that object in document?
[13:52:55] <drewh> like $(this "> .childClass")
[13:57:11] <jedimind> drew $('.childClass', $(this))
[13:57:19] <jedimind> $('.selector', scope)
[13:57:37] <jedimind> im not sure if you can do immediate selector in that case with '> .child' but try it
[13:57:47] <jedimind> you can always hack it with something like
[13:57:59] <jedimind> $($(this).id + ' > .child').
[13:58:19] <jedimind> err $('#' + $(this).id + ' > .child')
[14:00:21] <drewh> thanks jedimind
[14:01:24] <jedimind> ryanneufeld, ive watched that video like 5 times today, crack up so hard each time
[14:01:42] <ryanneufeld> funny as
[14:03:18] <uSMS> can someone help me out with this: http://jsfiddle.net/myVrQ/1/, I cant figure out why split(' ') isnt working in this case
[14:03:43] <uSMS> not exactly a jquery question, although there may be a different way to do it with jquery vs javascript
[14:04:46] <jedimind> its not the split that's the problem
[14:04:47] <jedimind> its ce.find('td').eq(0).text()
[14:04:48] <jedimind> its not finding it
[14:05:11] <uSMS> oh ok. why isnt it finding it?
[14:05:23] <uSMS> oh
[14:05:39] <uSMS> one sec, i messed up the jsfiddle. it has the class on the real page
[14:06:17] <uSMS> ok class added, still doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/myVrQ/2/
[14:06:44] <SoulRaven> please help me, i don't know how to remove this div, data.replace(/<div class="timeToolBar .*>.*<\/div>/g,'')
[14:06:57] <SoulRaven> i am not sure that regex is right
[14:07:05] <jedimind> uSMS, the split works fine
[14:07:13] <jedimind> alert(cityStateArray[0]) returns "hollywood"
[14:07:53] <uSMS> ok, one sec. im trying to figure out what is different in the jsfiddle vs real page
[14:07:59] <jedimind> uSMS, the problem is
[14:08:02] <jedimind> your if statements are contradictory
[14:08:09] <jedimind> so its looking for NOT 4, and exactly 3
[14:08:18] <jedimind> but your array has a length of 4
[14:08:19] <LindsayMac> a walking contradiction?
[14:08:22] <jedimind> so your conditions are not being met
[14:08:47] <uSMS> wow, that is obvious. i guess i did that when i was rewriting multiple times -_-..
[14:09:02] <Krambiorix_> i have a function and i get the caller id like this: event.target.id  -> the target is a span... How can i get the text in the span??
[14:10:28] <SoulRaven> anyone?
[14:12:18] <uSMS> jedimind: i didnt realize there were 2 spaces between state and zip either
[14:14:34] <jedimind> uSMS, yeah you're all kinds of silly
[14:21:33] <LindsayMac> jedimind:  i am officially looking in to rolling my own slider instead of using the scrollTo
[14:21:53] <Brodingo> _officially_
[14:22:07] <jedimind> BAM!
[14:22:10] <jedimind> did you stamp it?
[14:22:13] <jedimind> cuz if not, its not official
[14:22:22] <LindsayMac> You KNOW i stamped it
[14:23:25] <LindsayMac> this isn't a good thing to see http://cl.ly/image/461G3s2Z2g2V
[14:25:04] <Brodingo> looks good
[14:25:14] <tw2113> you can't read that?
[14:25:17] <Brodingo> playing mahjong
[14:25:27] <LindsayMac> Any good tutorials you guys can think of for making my own "slider"
[14:25:37] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  i'm not a cyborg like you
[14:25:56] <tw2113> it reads "michael is a tool" over and over again
[14:26:09] <LindsayMac> aw that is sad
[14:26:47] <faryshta> Hi I have this page that works perfectly on FF and Chrome http://rva.fonotecanacional.gob.mx/wp-login.php?redirect_to=http://rva.fonotecanacional.gob.mx/?p=1016&action=anonimo the problem with IE is that when you click the second row of thumbnails the functionality dissapears.
[14:27:58] <faryshta> Is $("ul>li") supported for IE?
[14:28:49] <jedimind> faryshta,
[14:28:57] <jedimind> jquery uses a native selector engine called sizzle
[14:29:02] <jedimind> which is completely agnostic of the browser itself
[14:30:09] <faryshta> jedimind: but the problems are only on IE8. I don't know what can that be.
[14:30:13] <TelFiRE> Hi guys, anyone see why my YouTube videos won't load in colorbox? I've tried everything I can find, I get a white box. This was previously working and we haven't touched it, so I'm kind of at a loss. Thanks very much in advance! http://www.christumcutah.net/gallery
[14:30:25] <jedimind> faryshta, maybe if you setup a testcase or something
[14:30:27] <jedimind> we can take a look at it?
[14:30:53] <faryshta> jedimind: http://rva.fonotecanacional.gob.mx/wp-login.php?redirect_to=http://rva.fonotecanacional.gob.mx/?p=1016&action=anonimo is this good enough?
[14:32:09] <jedimind> its usually best to isolate your specific problem
[14:32:14] <jedimind> i dont know what part of that whole page is causing issues
[14:32:30] <jedimind> further more, in the process of pulling it out of your environment and isolating it, you may realize that there could be something else entirely causing the problem
[14:32:55] <faryshta> jedimind: ok where can I upload a script with jquery support?
[14:33:00] <jedimind> jsfiddle.net
[14:35:46] <LindsayMac> I can't work out how, when making a slider, you can click to a slide without passing by the others.
[14:36:44] <LindsayMac> So if i am on slide1 and I click on a nav link to go to slide 4, how does it not pass by / show 2 and 3
[14:37:22] <Jon47> LindsayMac: by dynamically altering the content?
[14:37:34] <LindsayMac> Jon47:  I dont know what you mean by that
[14:37:57] <faryshta> jedimind: http://jsfiddle.net/gPRB3/
[14:38:00] <LindsayMac> I would imagine that the containers would be stacked on top of each other in a z-index of some sort.. but i still can't work it out
[14:38:55] <LindsayMac> I know it can be done, but i'm looking at a few examples and haven't found one that does it yet.
[14:39:59] <MistuhKurtz> LindsayMac, often times all of the other slides are all positioned the same
[14:40:42] <LindsayMac> MistuhKurtz:  so i'm just trying to see how that is done.. and what type of change occurs to show one and hide the other.. its not a simple move to the left type of thing
[14:43:27] <TelFiRE> LindsayMac: rather than just animating the whole container, you would add to your function for next slide that the slide immediately goes to the far right (or left depending which way they clicked) and THEN animates to its final position
[14:44:29] <LindsayMac> TelFiRE:  i'm not sure I understand...
[14:45:33] <TelFiRE> I'm assuming you know how to modify the position of the slide with jquery...
[14:46:00] <LindsayMac> TelFiRE:  yes.
[14:46:22] <TelFiRE> instead of modifying the container of all the slides and having it move to wherever it needs go to, animate the slides individually. Send the slide they're trying to access to right: -100% and then animate it to right:0
[14:46:25] <LindsayMac> TelFiRE:  i've been able to make sliders with the basic row of container next to each other and slide from left to right or directly to the container with #
[14:47:06] <LindsayMac> I understand animating it "out of the way" by going 100% to the right, but then what do you mean animate it to right:0 ?
[14:49:44] <LindsayMac> Ahh i think i found one that basically does it http://www.devtrix.net/sliderman/examples.html
[14:49:50] <LindsayMac> not going to use it, but I can use it to learn from
[14:52:49] <LindsayMac> Ohh that one is weird. It takes an array of images and loads them in to a div individually as needed
[15:00:34] <LindsayMac> Is there a name for that kind of sliding effect? Like, i know that there are continuous sliders and linear sliders.. just trying to google the right stuff
[15:07:51] <LindsayMac> any feelings on the Nivo slider/
[15:07:53] <LindsayMac> >?
[15:09:37] <alexidoia> I have .bind() an event on a a element and within that function, I am trying to get the first parent that is tr, how can I do this ?
[15:23:13] <TelFiRE> I am doing a YouTube video in a colorbox, and I have it just like the example on the colorbox page. But I get a JS error Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL ... from frame with URL http://www.youtube.com/.... Domains, protocols and ports must match.
[15:26:00] <fatmandown> can someone help me figure out why this form is still submitting? http://pastebin.com/yqLNfD8Y
[15:27:17] <rmurphey> you're returning false from the each, not from the submit handler
[15:27:32] <fatmandown> yeah I just figured that out on my own
[15:27:36] <fatmandown> thanks
[15:27:46] <TelFiRE> no such easy fix for mine :( lol
[15:28:34] <rmurphey> TelFiRE: are you sure that is the source of your issue? often the embed code will throw errors like that but it isn't really an issue
[15:28:50] <LindsayMac> TelFiRE:  i think that it is not an issue to worry about...
[15:28:50] <rmurphey> also you haven't said what your issue is :)
[15:28:54] <TelFiRE> It might not be. In safari I get no errors and the problem still occurs. The vid doesn't load
[15:29:01] <LindsayMac> Ohhhh
[15:29:04] <LindsayMac> thats different
[15:29:11] <LindsayMac> Did you try a different video? Just for testing's sake?
[15:29:14] <TelFiRE> yes
[15:29:17] <TelFiRE> many
[15:29:31] <LindsayMac> so it's working in some browsers and not in others.
[15:29:47] <TelFiRE> no
[15:29:51] <LindsayMac> or its not working in ANY but only tossing that error in one
[15:29:53] <TelFiRE> it just flat out isn't working, no video appears
[15:30:48] <TelFiRE> It appears to come up at the size of a normal YouTube video, but then shrink down to a small blank white box. From what i can tell the video is nowhere in the markup
[15:30:54] <TelFiRE> it doesnt' actually load the iframe :s
[15:31:48] <rmurphey> TelFiRE: can you make a test case in jsbin?
[15:31:52] <TelFiRE> ah scratch that, it's there but way below the colorbox area and not showing
[15:32:27] <LindsayMac> ;)
[15:33:16] <TelFiRE> well it's hard because js bin doesnt have colorbox
[15:34:05] <TelFiRE> can I pm you the actual url rmurphey
[15:35:09] <LindsayMac> TelFiRE:  you can use jsfiddle.net
[15:35:45] <TelFiRE> um same problem there..
[15:35:56] <fatmandown> rmurphey, I can't figure it out. How can I use the .each() to validate the form?
[15:36:13] <LindsayMac> TelFiRE:  you can add js resource files.
[15:36:24] <LindsayMac> So if you have the js files on your server, just point it to those.
[15:36:58] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: kill me now
[15:37:12] <rmurphey> fatmandown: inside of the each, you can set something to true/false
[15:37:27] <rmurphey> and then outside the each, return false if that thing is false
[15:38:24] <fatmandown> like what, a variable? wouldn't it only be within the scope of the each()
[15:38:26] <ifdef42> like: var valid = true; $.each() { blah; valid = false; blah; } return valid;
[15:39:01] <rmurphey> fatmandown: not if you declare it outside the each :)
[15:39:20] <ifdef42> are you a c programmer by chance? :)
[15:42:00] <TelFiRE> LindsayMac: well it works when I do it there, same code, same everything
[15:42:31] <rmurphey> TelFiRE: that is usually a good sign that something else is in play
[15:42:41] <TelFiRE> i mean for some reason the video is tiny and in a corner but whatever the basic problem is solved..
[15:44:23] <TelFiRE> yeah the video is definitely there, colorbox is just doing some stupid inline styles on the container to make it totally disappear
[15:55:20] <TelFiRE> well it seems those inline styles are total BS, maybe the new colorbox screwed with its core css or something... at any rate... works now... seems kinda hacky but I just positioned absolute the cbox container to 0 and it shows lol...
[15:59:48] <FrozenFire> Is there a way to detect duplicate id attributes in a specific pattern, and resolve the duplicates? I have an edge case where (due to some caching stuff, and the way the elements are being output to the page) I'm ending up with two elements on the page with the same ID attribute, but I need them to be unique.
[16:03:32] <Jon47> FrozenFire: if I had that issue I'd work to ensure there were no duplicates, not worry about how to test for duplicates after they're created
[16:04:11] <FrozenFire> Jon47, The former is impossible, unfortunately.
[16:04:41] <FrozenFire> And I don't use that word lightly.
[16:11:27] <FrozenFire> In any case, I'm writing a piece of Javascript that'll be used on many projects, so I want something with some fault tolerance.
[16:11:48] <FrozenFire> And being able to resolve duplicates without defaulting to failure is preferable.
[16:15:56] <LindsayMac> FrozenFire:  can you search for a string and simply add +1 to it?
[16:17:15] <FrozenFire> That's sort of the plan.
[16:17:59] <FrozenFire> I'm going to do something like var assets = $("[id^=foo]"), then determine which of those have a conflict going on with another in the set.
[16:18:06] <FrozenFire> And then try to resolve the conflict
[16:20:23] <faryshta> jedimind you there?
[16:20:37] <faryshta> jedimind:  looks like the problem was in fact the '>' selector.
[16:21:08] <faryshta> jedimind: I take it off and now it works properly on IE. Unfortunately that selector is one of the most used by me. I hate to give IE support.
[16:21:49] <jedimind> faryshta, are you setting a proper doctype?
[16:21:54] <jedimind> also what was the jsfiddle for it?
[16:22:03] <jedimind> the > child selector has been supported since ... ie7
[16:22:03] <LindsayMac> faryshta:  i've not had issues with > not working in iE
[16:22:17] <jedimind> however, if you dont have a proper doctype set, IE will get into quirks mode
[16:22:25] <jedimind> and not support descendant selectors
[16:22:40] <jedimind> err not support child selectors, only descendant selectors
[16:22:58] <faryshta> jedimind: yes, you can check it yourself http://rva.fonotecanacional.gob.mx/wp-login.php?redirect_to=http://rva.fonotecanacional.gob.mx/?p=1016&action=anonimo
[16:23:03] <faryshta> LindsayMac: can I see a sample code?
[16:23:27] <jedimind> what was the jsfiddle, i dont want to crawl your entire page to try to find the place where you're using the selector?
[16:23:36] <LindsayMac> faryshta:  i dont have anything on hand, but you can look at the standards
[16:23:49] <faryshta> jedimind: http://jsfiddle.net/gPRB3/
[16:24:07] <faryshta> LindsayMac: I know the standards and I know that for IE those mean nothing.
[16:24:16] <jedimind> <span class="spacer"></span><br><span class="spacer"></span>
[16:24:16] <jedimind> seriously?
[16:24:30] <LindsayMac> what?!
[16:24:39] <faryshta> jedimind: that was the code I received. I plan to change that but the functionality isn't there.
[16:25:01] <jedimind> ie8 is having the issue?
[16:25:22] <jedimind> that fiddle that yous ent me works perefectly fine in ie8...
[16:25:29] <faryshta> jedimind: yes only IE. I have IE8 don't know for other versions. Also I run IE on a virtual machine I don't know if that counts.
[16:25:38] <jedimind> i mean ...
[16:25:46] <jedimind> its increasing the size of the currently selected element
[16:25:51] <jedimind> i dont know what else its supposed to do
[16:26:00] <LindsayMac> faryshta: http://www.findmebyip.com/litmus/
[16:26:20] <faryshta> jedimind the blocks bellow must change when you click them.
[16:26:26] <FrozenFire> Is it possible to remove a particular object from the results of a selector?
[16:26:29] <jedimind> change how ?
[16:26:42] <jedimind> ohh those blocks
[16:26:44] <jedimind> i didnt scroll down
[16:26:45] <faryshta> jedimind: each color is a thumbnail I just don't have time to change each image path to absolute.
[16:26:59] <jedimind> yup... works fine for me in IE8, it changes the content below
[16:27:02] <jedimind> i mean it doesnt fade in/out
[16:27:04] <jedimind> but thats a different issue
[16:27:19] <LindsayMac> no time jedimind
[16:27:34] <jedimind> NEVER ENOUGH TIME
[16:29:35] <faryshta> LindsayMac: thanks but I don't see any use of jQuery '>' selector there.
[16:30:01] <faryshta> FrozenFire: $(selector).not(#id)
[16:30:43] <faryshta> FrozenFire: also http://www.google.com.mx/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CGEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.jquery.com%2Fnot-selector%2F&ei=jpklULDRJ5Ki8ASAoYHgDw&usg=AFQjCNExPFwGpjXYLCVHG6Ocwg_ACULY0w&sig2=HSt204-pUwJgUS8437Sheg
[16:30:52] <faryshta> upss http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[16:30:59] <FrozenFire> faryshta, Heh. Believe it or not, that doesn't cover it.
[16:31:11] <ogk1000> tryign to remove hash from window but its still leaving #
[16:31:11] <ogk1000> 		window.location.hash = ''; any ideas ?
[16:31:12] <FrozenFire> I have an existing set that I need to remove an element from.
[16:31:27] <faryshta> FrozenFire: how can you identify that element?
[16:31:29] <FrozenFire> The difficulty being that the id attribute is non-unique.
[16:31:39] <FrozenFire> I'm specifically trying to resolve conflicting id attributes
[16:32:02] <faryshta> FrozenFire: then how can you identify which one to delete?
[16:32:04] <FrozenFire> I was hoping there was some sort of internal DOM identifier that I might be able to filter by.
[16:32:32] <faryshta> FrozenFire: depends how do you want to identify the element to eliminate?
[16:32:58] <faryshta> .not method http://api.jquery.com/not/ :not selector http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[16:32:58] <FrozenFire> faryshta, The element I want to remove is "this" in the current scope
[16:33:13] <ogk1000> ideas anyone?
[16:33:20] <faryshta> FrozenFire: $(selector).not(this) ?
[16:33:37] <FrozenFire> faryshta, Not sure if that'll work. I'd have to check how .not does its filtering
[16:33:49] <FrozenFire> If it tries to filter by id attribute, that'll remove all of the items from the set
[16:34:02] <faryshta> ogk1000: http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascript-string-replace.php ?
[16:34:19] <faryshta> FrozenFire: I gave you  the documentation links.
[16:35:13] <FrozenFire> faryshta, Yes. I appreciate that. This is a fairly far-outfield edgecase :P
[16:35:18] <ogk1000> umm how does that help me faryshta
[16:35:33] <FrozenFire> I'll probably have to check the way that the not method functions
[16:35:40] <FrozenFire> As in, its source implementation

[16:48:44] <whomp> i have a series of images with the same class. when a user clicks on one of them, i want to know in the click function which of the images it is (the third? the fourth?). how can i do this?
[16:49:17] <dabear> ?index @ whomp
[16:49:18] <bot-t> whomp, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[16:50:41] <whomp> how would that fit into $('.pic').click(function(){/*determine which image it is*/})
[16:51:13] <dabear> it wouldn't
[16:51:24] <whomp> well i need something that works in that context
[16:51:32] <dabear> you would first have to save all pics into a variable
[16:51:53] <whomp> surely there is a simple way to do this...
[16:52:05] <dabear> then $yourPics.index(this) tells you the position
[16:52:08] <dabear> yes it is
[16:52:23] <dabear> and I just explained the procedure to you
[16:52:57] <whomp> ah thx
[16:53:42] <Consolas> hey guys
[16:53:57] <dabear> hey
[16:54:24] <Consolas> need a tip: I have several <ul> (with lis, of course) and want to create a click and selected function. the thing is: how can I individualize each ul?
[16:54:38] <Consolas> I know I can't add like a name tag to each ul like in the a href
[16:55:00] <dabear> "individualize"?
[16:55:24] <Consolas> yes, like to know what UL I clicked
[16:55:26] <dabear> add an html id attribute to each ul?
[16:55:33] <Consolas> I wanted to avoid the id
[16:55:40] <Consolas> but I think that its the only way to go here
[16:55:41] <Consolas> right?
[16:56:04] <Consolas> ul doesn0t have name nor anything else
[16:56:04] <dabear> if you want to uniquely identify an element, then use the id attribute
[16:56:31] <Consolas> Agree. Thanks budd
[16:56:32] <Consolas> y
[17:01:08] <citric> If I have a "close" button inside a modal dialog, how do I write an onclick function to close the dialog its in? $(this).parents(".ui-dialog").dialog("close") neither errors nor actually closes the dialog
[17:05:44] <Consolas> parents or parent ?
[17:05:51] <dabear> Consolas: he left:p
[17:05:56] <Consolas> oh
[17:05:57] <Consolas> ehhe
[17:06:34] <dabear> anyway, ge gotta go up to $(this).closest(".ui-dialog")
[17:07:21] <dabear> then .find(".ui-dialog-content")
[17:07:24] <dabear> and close it
[17:07:52] <dabear> I *hate* it when people make me check out their problem, them leave right away
[17:10:09] <fatmandown> http://pastebin.com/ptDbKkCL    I STILL can't get this validation to work. Can someone please help me?
[17:10:17] <fatmandown> I'm tearing my hair out trying to figure out why this won't work
[17:11:14] <dabear> fatmandown: and the problem with your code is what?
[17:11:38] <fatmandown> it submits no matter what is entered
[17:11:39] <dabear> .value will always be a string btw
[17:11:45] <dabear> ?demo @ fatmandown
[17:11:46] <bot-t> fatmandown, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:12:19] <fatmandown> dabear: works.techiteens.com/drsniffles/cal.php
[17:13:50] <dabear> you're including jquery validate, but rolling out your own validate functionality at the same time? 0o
[17:14:04] <fatmandown> whoops
[17:14:23] <fatmandown> well, no
[17:14:35] <fatmandown> those includes are just there from when i was testing it five minutes ago
[17:14:59] <dabear> and you're including both minified and non minified code
[17:15:27] <fatmandown> not anymore I'm not
[17:15:37] <dabear> and where is that code you pasted in pastebin? I can't seem to find it on your site
[17:15:49] <fatmandown> validate.js
[17:15:59] <fatmandown> dabear: works.techiteens.com/drsniffles/validate.js
[17:16:12] <fatmandown> waaaaaay at the bottom
[17:17:49] <dabear> I see now
[17:17:53] <dabear> wasn't there earlier
[17:18:42] <dabear> ah
[17:18:50] <dabear> you have a logic error
[17:18:57] <fatmandown> as per usual
[17:19:00] <fatmandown> where?
[17:19:20] <dabear> you set valid = true;
[17:19:37] <dabear> you set valid = true inside the each
[17:19:56] <dabear> you should set it outside at the beginning, var valid = true
[17:20:27] <dabear> and then set it to valid = false only if this.value != ""
[17:20:40] <fatmandown> yep
[17:20:42] <fatmandown> that's it
[17:20:46] <fatmandown> thank you so much
[17:20:49] <Consolas> guys, clicking on a ul, how can I access other ul (on the same "tree") ?
[17:21:01] <fatmandown> +1 for dabear
[17:21:08] <Consolas> I was thinking of something like parent and then from that poin accessing with the id
[17:21:24] <dabear> what happened here is that $('#apptform input, #apptform select') matched the <input type="submit value="Submit"
[17:21:32] <Consolas> on the lines of $(this.parent()."#some_id").stuff
[17:21:36] <dabear> so it always set valid=true
[17:21:54] <dabear> because the last input had a non empty value
[17:22:40] <dabear> Consolas: save all uls into a variable
[17:22:42] <ita> hey
[17:22:42] <fatmandown> because it always has a value assigned to it
[17:23:01] <dabear> then $yourelements.eq(2) or .eq(3) etc
[17:23:04] <ita> hey guts, somebody ever used a slideing content carousel
[17:23:14] <ita> ?
[17:23:21] <Consolas> dabear I dont think I need that, I just want to go back from the clicking ul and from that point on I can access the ul by its id
[17:23:40] <Consolas> ul id = 1, ul id = 2, if I click on 2, I want to do stuff to the one
[17:23:56] <dabear> if you need to access document elements more than once, always save to a variable
[17:24:32] <Consolas> this is a list of uls and I have to access them if the user clicks on them to enable future actions
[17:24:40] <dabear> Consolas: if the uls are direct siblings (have same direct parent) then .prev(), .next()
[17:25:15] <Consolas> $(this).parent().("ul #1").addClass('bodySelected'); I want something like this
[17:25:22] <Consolas> the ul #1 the 1 is the id
[17:25:31] <Consolas> I really struggle with this
[17:25:42] <dabear> ?find @ Consolas
[17:25:42] <bot-t> Consolas, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[17:25:58] <Consolas> thanks, gonna check into it!
[17:27:56] <dabear> $(this).nextAll("ul").first() //gets you the next ul, asuming you have other elements than ul's in that parent
[17:28:05] <Consolas> $(this).parent().find("#1")
[17:28:06] <Consolas> awesome
[17:28:18] <Consolas> yeah, thanks dab
[17:28:27] <Consolas> the find was what I wanted
[17:28:51] <dabear> btw in html 4, you cannot have ids starting with numbers
[17:29:06] <dabear> it works in most browsers though
[17:36:55] <dabear> ?debugging
[17:36:56] <bot-t> Firebug: http://www.getfirebug.com/ or Firebug Lite (for non-firefox browsers): http://www.getfirebug.com/lite.html plus Debug: http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/
[17:37:02] <dabear> ?debugging @ fatmandown
[17:37:03] <bot-t> fatmandown, Firebug: http://www.getfirebug.com/ or Firebug Lite (for non-firefox browsers): http://www.getfirebug.com/lite.html plus Debug: http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/
[17:37:30] <dabear> fatmandown: you should try setting breakpoints in your debug console
[17:37:43] <dabear> it helps tracking those kinda errors?
[17:37:49] <dabear> -?
[17:57:26] <NetTalk> $(this).append("<a href='#' class='next-tab mover' rel='" + next + "' onclick='$(\"#next_button\").attr(\"action\", \"<?php echo $module; ?>/admin/create\");'>Next Page &#187;</a>");
[17:57:34] <NetTalk> whats wrong with my code
[17:58:10] <NetTalk> i am trying to have an form action over the next page link
[18:18:14] <NetTalk> $(this).append("<a href='#' class='next-tab mover' rel='" + next + "' onclick='$(\"#next_button\").attr(\"action\", \"<?php echo $module; ?>/admin/create\");'>Next Page &#187;</a>");
[18:18:15] <NetTalk>           
[18:18:43] <NetTalk> i need to know how to put an action on the hyper link
[18:23:34] <sbfds> is there a way to programmatically make @font-face declarations in js?
[18:26:27] <amh345> i want to repeat some text in a changing between 2 colors.   i've downloaded the plug for colors and it's working nicely.  im looking at how to repeat it though.   i see a lib called jquery.timers.   it has a method called everyTime.   is this timer lib advised for what i want to do or is there another way?
[18:29:48] <ralphholzmann> sbfds: you could create it using JS
[18:29:55] <ralphholzmann> the "string" of css
[18:30:00] <ralphholzmann> and then inject it into a style declaration
[18:42:11] <paul_irish> hi friends!
[18:42:16] <paul_irish> whats the right way to trigger the change special event?  https://github.com/freqdec/fd-slider/issues/22
[18:42:31] <paul_irish> .change() doesnt seem to run all the handlers
[18:42:39] <paul_irish> because change is a "special" event internally
[19:30:27] <quiznilo> has anyone ever tried using a class selector ('.foo') in order to serialize just specific elements of a form?  I can't seem to get that to work
[19:38:01] <shoky> quiznilo: works fine for me
[19:44:49] <quiznilo> hmm
[19:44:56] <quiznilo> shoky: thanks
[20:18:24] <defaultro> if let say folks, your site is a busy site. You have a feature where users can upload pictures. How will you take care of the storage?
[20:19:03] <defaultro> it's because I noticed, our uploaded image gets converted to base 64 via php function and added to xml before it gets sent to our REST service
[20:19:19] <defaultro> although, we have limits for the filesize

[22:18:57] <cordoval> guys
[22:19:16] <cordoval> i have a weird error on jquery.min version using fancybox 1.3.4
[22:19:27] <jedimind> go on...
[22:19:28] <cordoval> when i source with the jquery.js regular uncompressed it works
[22:19:31] * jedimind takes a seat
[22:19:48] <cordoval> but when i use the jquery.min it gives an error on a tmp.html(data)
[22:19:52] <jedimind> what version of jquery?
[22:19:56] <cordoval> and it is a deep jquery error
[22:19:57] <jedimind> (.min is not a version)
[22:19:59] <cordoval> jquery 1.1.7
[22:20:03] <cordoval> let me check
[22:20:04] <tw2113> ouch
[22:20:13] <jedimind> upgrade jquery
[22:20:19] <jedimind> thats older than balls
[22:20:28] <cordoval>  * jQuery JavaScript Library v1.7.1
[22:20:29] <jedimind> ... implying that balls are somehow inherently old
[22:20:30] <cordoval>  * http://jquery.com/
[22:20:35] <aximilation> http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#CDN_Hosted_jQuery
[22:20:44] <tw2113> so you typo'd the version?
[22:20:48] <cordoval> oh aximilation you rock, i am actually sourcing from cdn
[22:20:57] <cordoval> where did you find this aximilation, what makes you think this is it?
[22:21:08] <cordoval> yes tw2113
[22:21:17] <tw2113> just checking
[22:21:38] <cordoval> but aximilation i am using the google api ones there
[22:21:39] <jedimind> wait, what, 1.8 is not available on googleapis cdn?
[22:21:42] <cordoval> with those i have the error
[22:21:57] <tw2113> jQuery foundation can't control when google updates their shit
[22:22:05] <jedimind> lies
[22:22:11] <jedimind> and slander
[22:22:16] <cordoval> sticking with my issues any thoughts?
[22:22:43] <jedimind> upgrade to 1.8 see if that fixes it, it could be that minified version is missing a trailing ;l
[22:22:43] <cordoval> jquery.min from cdn does make fail with fancybox
[22:22:44] <jedimind> err l
[22:22:48] <jedimind> errr FUCK ;
[22:22:48] <cordoval> oh
[22:22:51] <cordoval> really?
[22:22:58] <cordoval> so the upgrade is the only option i have?
[22:23:02] <jedimind> _maybe_ im not exactly thinking straight, just try upgrading
[22:23:06] <jedimind> to eliminate a possibility
[22:23:11] <cordoval> upgrade to which specific version?
[22:23:16] <jedimind> in the amount of time its taken to explain that, you could've done it
[22:23:17] <jedimind> latest
[22:23:21] <jedimind> 1.8.0
[22:23:25] <aximilation> cordoval: where are you loading the non-min version from?
[22:23:51] <cordoval> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[22:23:51] <jedimind> are you concactinating fancybox js file w/ jquery.min?
[22:23:53] <cordoval>     <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="{{ asset('bundles/core/js/libs/jquery-1.7.1.min.js') }}"><\/script>')</script>
[22:24:04] <jedimind> he said the non-min
[22:24:05] <cordoval> right now they are separate
[22:24:06] <jedimind> the one that works
[22:24:19] <cordoval> the one that works is non min
[22:24:27] <jedimind> yeah, where is that hosted?
[22:24:29] <jedimind> also cdn, or local?
[22:24:34] <cordoval> cdn on google
[22:24:39] <jedimind> k
[22:24:43] <cordoval> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.js"></script>
[22:24:44] <jedimind> seriously, just try 1.8
[22:24:51] <jedimind> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.0.min.js
[22:24:56] <cordoval> great ok will try now
[22:25:29] <cordoval> oh from jquery not from google
[22:25:36] <cordoval> hmm, need to change further, let me check
[22:25:53] <jedimind> v yeah, we established a few mins ago that google hasnt gotten the latest version yet :)
[22:26:49] <cordoval> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.0.min.js"></script>
[22:26:52] <cordoval>     <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="{{ asset('bundles/core/js/libs/jquery-1.8.0.min.js') }}"><\/script>')</script>
[22:26:57] <cordoval> oh pardon my pastie error
[22:27:12] <jedimind> please stop pasting in the chan :)
[22:27:57] <aximilation> I'm just throwing this out there, but would that cause any XSS issues with browsers, running locas js vs the cdn like that...?
[22:28:13] <aximilation> halfway watching the chan here :)
[22:28:31] <aximilation> honestly haven't done that sort of cat, but I could see that being an issue potentially.
[22:29:28] <cordoval> guys
[22:29:30] <cordoval> you just rock
[22:29:31] <aximilation> cordoval: If I was doing that I would download the min file from the CDN, same version as what you are using locally, and try that to at least eliminate one option
[22:29:36] <cordoval> i guess minified 1.7.1 just sucks big time
[22:30:07] <cordoval> eliminate the option of being affected by the cdn distance?
[22:30:11] <cordoval> hmm
[22:30:18] <cordoval> but since 1.8.0 worked fine
[22:30:40] <cordoval> what do you advise?
[22:30:48] <cordoval> will all other code mostly work with 1.8.0 too?
[22:31:00] <cordoval> i have backbonejs, jquery, tons of other custom js
[22:31:05] <cordoval> lots of assets
[22:31:26] <cordoval> i guess i will just throw the solution to my upper chain and see what they say
[22:31:35] <cordoval> one more thing
[22:31:48] <cordoval> you guys rock, just rock, terminator's thumbs up
[22:33:10] <jedimind> aximilation, no there are no cross domain or scripting issues with loading from a cdn
[22:33:46] <jedimind> cordoval, it should be fine, if you're using mostly updated versions of your stack
[22:33:54] <aximilation> jedimind: I didn't think so, but it was one difference I'd have eliminated off the bat
[22:34:20] <jedimind> yeah, i can tell from the code he pasted that its from html5boilerplate
[22:34:39] <jedimind> and its effectively tried tested and true methodologies in there (barring any personal grudges to some presets in the css)
[22:34:41] <aximilation> that is odd that the (local) normal 1.7 vs the (cdn) 1.7min would not function identically
[22:35:01] <jedimind> aximilation, the non-minified version he was using was also from the cdn
[22:35:02] <jedimind> not local
[22:35:16] <jedimind> both were from the cdn; i am suspecting howver that the minified version might be missing a trailing ;
[22:35:17] <aximilation> oh, missed that, and even odder :D
[22:35:29] <jedimind> which might interfere with the start of the next js file
[22:35:33] <jedimind> but thats just off the top of my head
[22:35:38] <aximilation> good thought
[22:45:04] <cordoval> thanks a lot
[22:45:17] <jedimind> np, im out for the night
[22:46:24] <cdaringe> hi guys, i'm taking an appendTo lesson where it seems to queue up events if i load times in the animations.  however, if i don't specify animation times, the events do not queue up.  can you take a peek?  I think the behavior should be the same, regardless of the duration.  http://jsfiddle.net/cdaringe/PHUrB/1/
[22:50:44] <PeYKaR> is there any alternative for mootools "assets" (loading css/js on the fly) in jquery? ( http://mootools.net/docs/more/Utilities/Assets )
[22:50:56] <PeYKaR> I need to load css and js dynamically
[23:01:17] <cdaringe> everyone is sound asleep!  or out late! :)
[23:01:33] <ruby_on_tails> bored
[23:17:15] <cdaringe> ruby_on_tails: you can help me if you're bored!
[23:17:27] <ruby_on_tails> cdaringe: with what ?
[23:17:51] <cdaringe> http://jsfiddle.net/cdaringe/PHUrB/1/
[23:19:00] <cdaringe> if you add durations to the show and hide, as you hover over the 'privacyDiv' its starts queueing up the event handlers (i.e., shake your mouse over it back and forth real quick, and it animates many times).  but, if you remove the times.
[23:19:49] <cdaringe> remove them from the show() & hide(), what do you know, the mouseovers & mouseout seem to disable until the animations are complete.
[23:23:14] <ruby_on_tails> cdaringe: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[23:23:23] <ruby_on_tails> http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html second answer here
[23:27:18] <cdaringe> ruby_on_tails: yea, that would definitely work.  what's frustrating though, is i explicitly unbound the mouseover event after the mouseover event was handled, yet it still fires.  and it works without (###).  i guess i'm more just curious why explicitly unbinding the event didn't work [not shown in my link].  i will certainly use this hoverIntent going forward
[23:28:55] <ruby_on_tails> not sure about that
[23:31:20] <cdaringe> yea. raw deal. hey, thanks for showin' me that tho
