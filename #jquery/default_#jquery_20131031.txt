[00:23:32] <alexw> is it better to load jquery from a CDN?
[00:23:49] <geiregjo> yes
[00:23:58] <joroci> yea
[00:24:23] <geiregjo> But if you are some big company who can't depend on an external service then you might host them yourselves.
[00:24:55] <geiregjo> My manager is scared that the CDN's might go down or that some guy uploads a broken file. -.-
[00:28:40] <alexw> yeah
[00:28:42] <alexw> good point
[00:28:59] <alexw> I mean the issue I have is once I combine jquery + jquery ui + bootstrap + my source
[00:29:05] <alexw> I end up with a 200kb file
[00:29:10] <alexw> that's minified
[00:29:49] <alexw> where as most users will have jquery (and maybe jquery ui) cached in CDN
[00:32:03] <_rgn> and what's the issue
[00:36:11] <CoolShades> hi
[00:36:18] <CoolShades> anyone uses jqplot
[00:38:46] <zquad> anyone familiar with fancybox?
[00:39:07] <zquad> how do you close a specific instance of fancybox if you have multiple on the page?
[00:43:06] <silentboy> @alex, google CDN for jquery, the rest should be on official page
[00:50:43] <lite_> im "sort of" new to the whole web development thing and im currently working on performance testing a big web application. looking at a timeline for a page load it would appear that each time the page is loaded +100k dom nodes are created. This is theoretically fine in my mind if not for the fact that 75k of them are garbage collected like 10 seconds after. Is this how web pages work when using jquery and javascript? It seems extremely inefficient
[00:52:11] <silentboy> break your statement in shorter line
[03:30:25] <kpl> In   $(document).ready(function () {   I have both    $("#maingroupslist").on("click", "div", function () {alert("o";});   and    $("#maingroupcontent").on("click", "div", function () {});       Firebug shows that both <div id="maingroupslist"> and <div id="maingroupcontent"> contain subdivs. The first contain e.g. <div id="groupid5">. However, only the 2nd ("#maingroupcontent") responds to...
[03:30:27] <kpl> ...clicks. Firebug event log for the first shows mousemove, mousedown/up, and click. What should I look for to find out why the 1st does not respond?
[03:32:15] <kpl> When I use .on it does not matter if subdivs are appended after $(document).ready(function () { has been run, right?
[03:33:40] <seutje> yush\
[03:34:52] <sahbeewah> kpl, $('#maingroupslist') needs to exist in the dom at the point where you assign your click handler
[03:36:32] <kpl> This is because I use an id? If I used a class, would it the need to exist?
[03:37:47] <sahbeewah> this is because you can't assign handlers to things that don't exist
[03:38:44] <kpl> Sorry, I meant the subdivs of the '#maingroupslist' div. They don't need to exist when I assign the handler the way I do?
[03:39:39] <sahbeewah> no they don't
[03:40:14] <sahbeewah> but #maingroupslist itself does
[03:42:49] <kpl> What confuses me is that both #maingroupslist and #maingroupcontent are in the same file, so if one exists I would expect the other to exist when $(document).ready(function () is run. I guess I could set a breakpoint in $(document).ready(function ()  to check?
[03:45:14] <sahbeewah> set a break point before you attach the handler and see if the selector actually returns a jquery object
[03:48:25] <kpl> Maybe the problem could be related to the fact that I'm using ASP.NET MVC with a @section scripts{ <script src="~/Scripts/js/init.js"></script>} where init.js contains the $(document).ready(). However, I attach two handlers in the same .ready(), so I cannot see why they shouldn't both be attached.
[03:51:01] <sahbeewah> maybe you should not second guess and just trace through the js code and see what's happening
[03:54:39] <kpl> You're right. Trying to find out how I can set that breakpoint, as the $(document).ready() is not shown in the debugger. Which might be related to my problem..
[03:55:50] <sahbeewah> you set a breakpoint by clicking on the line number in your script debugger
[03:55:58] <sahbeewah> or just type a line in the code "debugger;"
[03:57:05] <satya22> jquery ajax allways retruning error
[03:59:21] <Sendoushi> hey guys. do you know a way to get the window position of an element? the element is really nested. tried offset but it gave me like 1600px on the top (my monitor is like 1200) and a left of 0
[04:00:16] <kpl> sahbeewah: thanks, inserting "debugger;" activates the debugger. How would you "see if the selector actually returns a jquery object"?
[04:00:33] <satya22> service call successfully but status return error http://pastebin.com/HYznN2s1
[04:00:45] <seutje> kpl: $('.foo').length
[04:03:15] <sahbeewah> Sendoushi, subtract $(window).scrollTop() from the offset
[04:03:34] <Sendoushi> but i got a left: 0 that is strange
[04:04:13] <Sendoushi> the top yes i knew it was that but the left? hmm left 0? strange... it's on the middle of th epage
[04:04:14] <kpl> seutje: entering $("maingroupslist").length in debugger console returns 1
[04:06:34] <sahbeewah> Sendoushi, how are you sure that it is in the middle of the page? perhaps it is on the left with a left padding
[04:07:43] <sahbeewah> kpl, the handler should work then. you should post some code for more help
[04:10:40] <Sendoushi> sahbeewah, yes but... i need to get the window position. even with the paddings
[04:11:22] <sahbeewah> Sendoushi, are you talking about position of the window relative to their desktop?
[04:11:49] <Sendoushi> no. position of element relative to the browser window 0,0
[04:12:13] <Sendoushi> i need this because i'm doing a dropdown plugin and when the dropdown gets out of the window it inverts to the other side
[04:13:32] <sahbeewah> well unfortunately (fortunately) padding is considered part of the element, you will have to use some math with the element paddings to get the exact numbers you need
[04:15:39] <SprkDev> anyone? http://pastebin.com/gNJ32CS8 why doesn't the less block get called?
[04:18:21] <sahbeewah> SprkDev, it is being called, but $('#less') doesn't exist at the point you're assigning the handler
[04:18:28] <sahbeewah> this sure is a common problem
[04:18:31] <sahbeewah> . . .
[04:18:39] <SprkDev> so do I move it above?
[04:19:11] <sahbeewah> no
[04:19:37] <sahbeewah> how urgent/important is this code?
[04:20:03] <blewp> KnockoutJs question: i have a view model, with an observableArray containing a type that also has an observableArray
[04:20:12] <blewp> how would i create the nested foreach binding?
[04:31:10] <kpl> sahbeewah: I suspect that the problem might have been that the js was cached by the browser, and not updated after I added the new $("#maingroupslist").on("click", ...).

[04:58:01] <paulvd> btw it can be done through css also
[04:58:02] <paulvd> :hover
[05:01:11] <ShawnRisk> yes but if you look at the code and the page, you will see what I want.  I have a slideshow and when I mouseover, I want the image to show up but on mouseout show the image that is clicked.
[05:01:40] <ShawnRisk> I mean not clicked that was there before the hover.
[05:05:02] <ShawnRisk> paulvd: can you look at the code and website?

[05:28:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> :D
[05:29:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> ShawnRisk: in your pastebin....for selectors use $ instead of jQuery
[05:29:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> also .hover is almost deprecated
[05:29:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> use .on("hover"..... for example

[05:35:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> ShawnRisk: i suggest you read the api and check what is new in 1.10.X
[05:36:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> lots of new stuff

[05:36:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> wrong place to ask

[05:36:26] <ShawnRisk> ok
[05:36:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> *worked
[05:36:53] <troop> $('.class').children('img').height(); is right? i dont understand

[05:38:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> troop: gets the height of first child

[05:44:50] <Narwhaal> hi, is there a way for me to check if a person has "seen" a textbox ?
[05:45:38] <CodesStuff> onmouseover or onfocus?
[05:46:14] <CodesStuff> Or get the dimensions ot the window and set a box with a fixed width and height
[05:46:18] <grafi> Narwhaal whaa
[05:46:35] <CodesStuff> then see if the viewport is within those coordinates
[05:46:35] <CodesStuff> Unfortunately the ocular sensory API isn't going to be available until HTML6.
[05:47:12] <Narwhaal> well, it must be able to check if a webbrowser's tab is "on", then check if user can see the text
[05:47:18] <grafi> modals, modals everywhere
[05:47:21] <Narwhaal> all I *really* need is tab detection
[05:47:35] <grafi> sounds strange
[05:47:42] <grafi> go do something else
[05:47:54] <Narwhaal> I can't :(
[05:48:12] <Forbidd3n> anyone here have or know of a simple jquery script that uses the preloader and checks the status of a page loading in the background via an ajax call?
[05:49:35] <kpl> If I have done .css("background-color", color); is there a selector for that element based on the background-color?
[05:49:41] <CodesStuff> Forbidd3n: http://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/
[05:50:50] <CodesStuff> kpl: You'll have to select all of the elements with the same tag/class name, then iterate through them and check the bg color
[05:51:05] <CodesStuff> Then just use $(this).* within the .each().
[05:56:11] <kpl> So $( "div" ).each(function(){if ( this.style.color == "blue" ) {} } ?
[05:57:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> kpl: you could use for if $(this).css(background-color") == "blue"){}
[06:02:12] <ShawnRisk> grafi: I get this error when I hover over with your code: Uncaught TypeError: Object slideshow_conjob893.jpg has no method 'attr'
[06:02:59] <ShawnRisk> grafi: with this line: img.data = ('old', img.attr('src')).attr('src', src);
[06:03:34] <CodesStuff> because he didnt use the jquery obj @ shawnrisk
[06:03:50] <grafi> img.data = doesnt make sense oô
[06:04:19] <grafi> and its not whats in the pastebin ^^
[06:04:36] <grafi> and it is the jqobj CodesStuff ^^
[06:04:47] <CodesStuff> old_img = $('img').attr('data-old',$('img').attr('src'));
[06:05:13] <ShawnRisk> oops
[06:05:15] <ShawnRisk> sorry
[06:05:18] <ShawnRisk> I see that now
[06:05:51] <ShawnRisk> thanks

[06:11:36] <ShawnRisk> grafi: the text doesn't change now.  I mean the alt text doesn't change if I hover over the image.  I think the switching of text is messed up.
[06:11:58] <grafi> it doesnt switch text, it only switches image source
[06:12:09] <grafi> maybe you should switch the whole image then
[06:12:15] <ShawnRisk> oh

[06:19:09] <Jac0bz1> I need some serious wizard help here! I'm trying to make a plugin for a responsive menu, and It works almost.. Only one problem, if I scale the window. The "mobile" menu inherits the mouse-over event from the "normal" menu.. And I want the "mobile" menu to be click-only.. Hard to explain, try http://jsbin.com/AruXEHI/3/ start with regular window size (over 767px) and hover menu, then resize window until show menu displays.
[06:33:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> Jac0bz1: really you should use touch start instead of click.....might I suggest to use a big if statement in side of a resize function
[06:33:40] * Velveeta rubs his hands together.
[06:33:48] <Velveeta> oh boy! what are we talking about?!
[06:33:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> that tests the width and according to your break points in css (which i am assuming you are using for styling)......activate certain events
[06:34:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: I need some serious wizard help here! I'm trying to make a plugin for a responsive menu, and It works almost.. Only one problem, if I scale the window.

[06:34:29] <troop> hi.

[06:34:43] <Jac0bz1> Rohan_Bhangui: I'm not shure I understand, but I have multiple if statesments to test test the width..
[06:34:46] <Velveeta> grafi: heya
[06:34:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> like
[06:34:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> use a
[06:34:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> window.resize
[06:34:55] <troop> what's that effect's name? http://tympanus.net/Development/GridLoadingEffects/index.html ( image loading while scrolling) thanks...
[06:34:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> event
[06:34:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> and inside
[06:35:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> you can test for width
[06:35:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> if the width is certain amount
[06:35:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> then activate certain events
[06:35:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> and in those certain events
[06:35:30] <Jac0bz1> I do have that, that's what fires the dropMenuInit functionc
[06:35:34] <Velveeta> well, one thing i can say is that in general, you don't have to worry about people dragging to resize their windows on touch interfaces
[06:36:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> well velveeta......its a problem if he wants it to work for computers
[06:36:10] <Velveeta> right, like all in ones
[06:36:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: rule number 1 of programming: never trust user
[06:36:22] <Jac0bz1> :)
[06:36:44] <Velveeta> so, do you have :hover pseudoselectors for your menus?
[06:36:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> Jac0bz1: just test width using if in every event where mobile is used
[06:37:00] <Velveeta> and also, do you use something like modernizr for feature detection?
[06:37:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> of events that are reliant on mobile click
[06:37:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> which actually should be  .on("click touchstart"
[06:37:45] <grafi> Velveeta maybe in windows 8 ?
[06:37:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i think this is more of a size detection issue rather than compatibility issue
[06:37:57] <grafi> at least there its possible
[06:38:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: /
[06:38:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> *?
[06:38:23] <grafi> resizing touch stuff
[06:38:24] <Velveeta> grafi: yeah i had mentioned that it might be an issue on machines like all in ones that are desktops *with* touch capabilities
[06:38:34] <grafi> oh i see :p
[06:38:44] <grafi> i just wanted you to say windows8 ^^
[06:38:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[06:39:06] <Velveeta> oh ok, here you go then: windows 8 probably won't be much of an issue because it's still so horrible that nobody wants to use it :)
[06:39:34] <Velveeta> *however* there are those suckers that it's foisted upon in the purchase of a new machine these days :D
[06:40:21] <grafi> sadly -.-
[06:41:05] <Velveeta> so to add to what rohan said, if this is an issue where you specifically want to identify "mobile" browsers as opposed to doing feature detection (bad practice, btw), then yes, you'd want to do a window size check for those events, and even that's gonna be unreliable, if the user is on a desktop with a shrunken window
[06:41:44] <grafi> in an effort to drive people to open source solutions microsoft created windows 8 :D
[06:41:50] <Velveeta> the proper way to do it would be to use something like modernizr to detect touch support, and then wire up your stuff based on what it finds, using either touch or mouse events… at least until pointer events become widely supported
[06:41:57] <Velveeta> grafi: heheheh
[06:42:22] <Velveeta> also, be advised that ios tries to simulate :hover events from your css using clicks
[06:42:53] <grafi> which is working quite well if you dont try to be clever ^^
[06:42:59] <Vorspire> can't you use event.StopPropagation() ?
[06:42:59] <Velveeta> so if you have the intention of something being clicked on for a call to action, and it has a :hover pseudo selector in your css, the first click on it won't activate the action, it'll active the hover class
[06:43:27] <Velveeta> vorspire: stopProp on which event?
[06:43:54] <Vorspire> when you bind using .on, the function argument can accept an event object, right?
[06:44:09] <rmcdaniel> ooo I think I found a bug in jQueryUI's draggable
[06:44:14] <Vorspire> .on("click", function( e ) { e.stopPropagation(); } );
[06:44:47] <filipiz> `api on
[06:44:47] <b-ot> filipiz: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:44:57] <Velveeta> vorspire: are you talking about for ios's simulation of hover events?
[06:45:01] <filipiz> `google scriptaculous
[06:45:01] <b-ot> filipiz: script.aculo.us - web 2.0 javascript → http://script.aculo.us/
[06:45:34] <Vorspire> any event, I thought the problem was taht the event was bubbling up the tree too far or something?
[06:45:56] <Vorspire> whenever i bind my own click events i always use stopPropagation and preventDefault anyway out of habit
[06:46:04] <rmcdaniel> if you constrain a draggable to the x or y axis but also use a delay so that it only starts dragging after N pixels, it will start dragging even if those N pixels weren't on the configured axis
[06:46:17] <Jac0bz1> Rohan_Bhangui: I fixed it with unbinding events with off()
[06:46:30] <filipiz> `caniuse lastchild
[06:46:30] <b-ot> filipiz: Sorry, I can't find anything on lastchild
[06:46:34] <filipiz> `caniuse last-child
[06:46:35] <b-ot> filipiz: Sorry, I can't find anything on last-child
[06:46:37] <Velveeta> so as far as how it simulates hovers with clicks in ios, i'm not sure what method it uses internally to fire that… it might be that stopping the bubbling is enough to prevent that, or maybe even a preventDefault (although if you click on an anchor with a :hover, you'd not only kill the potential hover, but also the click itself)
[06:46:40] <filipiz> `caniuse :lastchild
[06:46:40] <b-ot> filipiz: Sorry, I can't find anything on :lastchild
[06:47:59] <Velveeta> vorspire: also, i'm just gonna throw out there that there's no need to use both preventDefault and stopPropagation out of habit on your own click events unless you actually have a behavioral reason to stop the bubbling, as it'll cause any other click events in that dom path to be nullified, and no live events would work either
[06:48:44] <Velveeta> typically you always want your events to bubble, though you may want to prevent the default action
[06:50:41] <Velveeta> and on that note, i gotta grab a shower and get dressed up like mike ditka and head into the office :)
[06:50:41] <rmcdaniel> is there a jquery dev channel?
[06:50:49] <Velveeta> rmcdaniel: yes, #jquery-dev
[06:51:03] <rmcdaniel> oh I see it in the title now, but it was hidden by my client
[07:02:06] <andywww> i have a simple carousel plugin which i have implemented multiple times on a page, when i use: $(window).on('resize.carousel', resize); it only fires the resize function of the latest instance of the plugin
[07:02:23] <andywww> is there a way i can somehow identify all instances as an array and fire it on them all?
[07:02:54] <Vorspire> (Velveeta): I only use them appropriately ;) but thanks for the tip
[07:03:19] <Velveeta> vorspire: ok good, it sounded like you used them as a blanket approach for a minute :D
[07:03:40] <Velveeta> ok now i gotta get outta here fuh realz!
[07:03:44] <Vorspire> usually only when fixing firefox issues
[07:03:50] <Vorspire> ok laters :)
[07:15:33] <kpl> I'm using .draggable and its stop event (i.e. no droppable) to determine where/whether to drop/insert. To add some highlights of hovered-over divs, is the drag event the way to go?
[07:17:41] <kpl> It seems droppable options are often used for this purpose.
[07:23:08] <rmcdaniel> don't use draggable, it's garbage
[07:23:29] <rmcdaniel> wait several years for the new version to come out
[07:23:44] <ezekielnoob> hello!
[07:42:00] <H1D> Hi! Can anyone explain why empty message-body response treated as error when using $.post ?
[07:43:26] <abailarri> Hello. How I can do to add or remove class of a div when other div is viewed?
[07:45:44] <NoiseEee> H1D: is the server sending back a 200 response?
[07:46:04] <H1D> Yep!
[07:46:20] <H1D> I already got the answer =)
[07:46:37] <H1D> Empty message is really an error when we have "Content-Type:application/json"
[07:47:06] <H1D> valid empty answer would be '{}'
[07:47:16] <H1D> valid empty answer would be "{}"
[07:54:43] <jparkton> is there a way to make connections to my database with jquery?
[07:55:05] <jparkton> something like using $_SESSION in php?
[07:59:19] <grafi> session makes databse connections=?
[08:00:48] <jparkton> no
[08:01:07] <jparkton> but also I guess using js to connect isnt safe
[08:01:31] <grafi> how so?
[08:01:38] <jparkton> maybe I stick to php
[08:01:58] <jparkton> I would google it, I dont know enough to answer productivly
[08:02:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi, Velveeta: what i miss
[08:02:48] <grafi> jparkton you cant really interchange javascript and php, aside from nodejs
[08:03:04] <grafi> so im not sure what you are trying to accomplish
[08:04:10] <jparkton> I have a user management system in php I wanted to use jquery to handle everything once the php has established its connection
[08:04:31] <frank_o> Using jQuery Cookie, how do I show #welcome the first time the user visits my site and/or closes the browser and visits it again? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/p2qp7/5/
[08:04:34] <jparkton> but I am new so it is a tedious process
[08:04:48] <andywww> I need to trigger a function on a plugin i am using multiple times on a page when the page is resized, i'm currently only able to get it to work on the latest instance of the plugin
[08:04:53] <andywww> is there a standard way to d this?
[08:05:34] <grafi> jparkton something like this would involve jquery/ajax sending request to a php script to get/update/delete stuff
[08:05:48] <grafi> so you would have to implement it in php anyways
[08:06:19] <jparkton> but can the php and jquery play nice together?
[08:06:27] <grafi> sure
[08:06:41] <jparkton> I assume I cant do var a = phpVariable
[08:07:01] <grafi> you could for example return json as a response
[08:07:07] <jparkton> oh
[08:07:08] <grafi> which javascript can "read"
[08:07:12] <jparkton> right
[08:07:21] <grafi> thats your medium then
[08:07:33] <jparkton> what would i need to look into to do that?
[08:08:56] <jparkton> this one? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9858448/converting-object-to-json-and-json-to-object-in-php-library-like-gson-for-java
[08:09:18] <Velveeta> ok, i'm all ditka'd up and headed in to the office
[08:09:23] <Velveeta> be back on in a bit
[08:09:29] <jparkton> daaa bulls
[08:09:57] <grafi> jparkton assuming you assemble your response data in an array you could just echo json_encode($array)
[08:10:31] <jparkton> oh my word
[08:10:37] <jparkton> that would be spiffy
[08:11:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: should jaax be used for jquery to php and vice versa interaction?
[08:11:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> *ajax
[08:12:05] <grafi> what else would you use for interaction?
[08:13:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[08:13:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> you mentioned something about
[08:13:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> nodejs
[08:14:08] <jparkton> I know nothing about ajax yet
[08:14:13] <grafi> nodejs is serverside javascript though, no php there :P
[08:14:26] <jparkton> I know it "can" be done nut I dont think I can do it lol
[08:14:32] <grafi> or at least i dont know how that works on the backend
[08:14:50] <grafi> its really not that hard jparkton :P
[08:15:13] <jparkton> you dont know the extent of my ineptitude :P
[08:15:49] <grafi> all you need is json, jquery selectors, ajax and eventhandling maybe
[08:15:54] <grafi> thats the javascript part
[08:16:28] <jparkton> would be willing to help?
[08:16:35] <grafi> sure
[08:17:39] <andywww> is it possible to bind an event to a click then later in the code to append another event?
[08:18:09] <jparkton> yes
[08:18:49] <jparkton> var a = 1; (later on) var a = 400;
[08:19:55] <jparkton> grafi can I PM you for a sec
[08:20:18] <grafi> you could also write here, so everybody can help :P
[08:20:40] <jparkton> they will all laugh at me though :(
[08:21:12] <ShawnRisk> grafi: I am still confused about how to make the image src and alt tags change at the same time.  I have looked into this for awhile and still only able to do one or the other not both.
[08:21:37] <andywww> jparkton: does that not overwrite the first value?
[08:21:45] <andywww> was that in answer to my question?
[08:21:58] <jparkton> the thing is I am building a site for people just getting out of courses like edx and codeacademy. Working with a couple other developers
[08:22:03] <jparkton> andy yes
[08:22:05] <andywww> i'm talking about appending functions to $(window).bind()
[08:22:14] <grafi> ShawnRisk let me have a look at that site of yours again
[08:22:15] <jparkton> oh
[08:22:23] <grafi> jparkton nobody will laugh :P
[08:22:34] <jparkton> http://gypsypython.com
[08:23:05] <jparkton> I wanted to just use a bare bones bootstrap, jquery, and minimum php
[08:23:30] <jparkton> I am going to do the user management in meteor but that is a learning curve
[08:24:15] <ShawnRisk> grafi: thanks, if you need anything let me know.
[08:26:22] <mvpgraff> is there a better way of doing scrollTop() > pixel to scrollTop() > window.top
[08:26:26] <jparkton> so once they login to the account side there is a button you click to add a project. I need to make that add the project in the database and append the "project" to the div showing projects but im pretty newbish and this is my project :)
[08:26:30] <grafi> ShawnRisk I wonder where the alt tags are ^^
[08:28:09] <grafi> jparkton you should finish the php portion first, otherwise the javascript stuff is useless :)
[08:28:37] <grafi> jparkton make it so your php can create a project
[08:30:11] <ShawnRisk> grafi: here is my jquery code: http://pastebin.com/kd3BU4pk let me know if that helps.
[08:30:58] <jparkton> so do the stuff in php since it would be another steep learning curve to do it in ajax / json  LOL
[08:31:14] <grafi> yeah im looking at that too, but on your page neither the big image nor the small images seem to have alt-tags so im confused :P
[08:31:34] <grafi> jparkton since the ajax stuff has to make a reqest to the php stuff
[08:31:41] <grafi> no php use for ajax
[08:32:23] <jparkton> but if I build it all up in php I can then use jquery to acces it if I use the json_encode()
[08:33:32] <ShawnRisk> grafi: yes I know but it is there I know that.  I am using a CMS so might not show but there.
[08:40:18] <grafi> ShawnRisk didnt realize you had a little slideshow going there that probably makes my javascript obsolete
[08:40:46] <ShawnRisk> grafi: oh, what to do?
[08:41:16] <grafi> remove the stuff you got from me :P
[08:41:31] <grafi> and then we'll figure out how to do it properly
[08:43:12] <ShawnRisk> grafi: done
[08:44:45] <grafi> ShawnRisk so whats the rest of your javascript? is that you trying to accomplish the same thing? then you should probably at least comment it out too
[08:50:04] <ShawnRisk> grafi: this is to create the sliding box where the thumbnails sit and then do the switching of the alt text but doesn't do switching of image when hovering.
[08:50:22] <ShawnRisk> comments yes
[08:56:33] <ShawnRisk> grafi: I added one comment, is there more needed?
[09:03:55] <ShawnRisk> grafi: still around?
[09:05:14] <grafi> yeah
[09:06:19] <ShawnRisk> grafi: anymore thoughts?
[09:07:02] <grafi> trying to make the right image visible atm
[09:07:11] <ShawnRisk> thanks
[09:10:33] <evilcrayon> what we talkin bout peeps?
[09:12:54] <grafi> ShawnRisk http://pastebin.com/sdKd2pSU try this
[09:16:51] <ShawnRisk> grafi: only problem is that if I mouseout of the thumbnails, I should be taken to the image and shown the text that is displayed before or clicked on.
[09:20:26] <rmah> man, I hate IE8 and less
[09:22:00] <grafi> ShawnRisk we'll get there, maybe
[09:39:35] <DelphiWorld> hi jqueryers
[09:39:57] <DelphiWorld> please can anyone help me with design just  by imagination/suggestion?
[09:40:10] <DelphiWorld> i'm blind and designing my own web site for my radio
[09:41:14] <DelphiWorld> if someone want to help please pm:)
[09:41:23] <ShawnRisk> grafi: off for lunch.  Let me know if you figure out anything else thanks
[09:45:52] <grafi> ShawnRisk this seems to work http://pastebin.com/15b1073r although it is some ugly ugly piece of code :P
[09:50:28] <DelphiWorld> anyone guys?
[09:51:03] <grafi> what now?
[09:51:16] <ktorvi> q
[09:55:33] <ShawnRisk> grafi: right that is me for you, I will test after Lunch
[09:58:30] <DelphiWorld> mmmmmm,  no one that can borrow me his eyes? :)
[09:58:55] <doug65536> DelphiWorld: what do you mean "radio"
[09:59:27] <DelphiWorld> doug65536:  a radio station site
[10:00:07] <doug65536> what's the question? how to make a radio site?
[10:00:12] <mikecmpbll> what would be the cleanest way, given a number of text areas, to check if any of them have content?
[10:00:34] <mikecmpbll> true if any one does
[10:00:37] <mikecmpbll> false if none do
[10:01:06] <doug65536> DelphiWorld: html5 has an audio tag that you can use to play audio. you simply set up to get events from it and set the src to an audio file
[10:01:10] <DelphiWorld> doug65536: no, can i pm you?
[10:01:18] <doug65536> DelphiWorld: sure
[10:08:55] <shwaiil> Q: What's the fastest way to remove one element from a container and then get the container back without that element ? $(containerElement).find('elementToRemove').remove(), is this the best ?
[10:09:00] <shwaiil> Thanks for looking
[10:09:16] <shwaiil> I mean, in this case by doing find() it removed the element, but how
[10:09:24] <shwaiil> to get back the previous ? it's the stop() or something can't remember
[10:12:43] <Cork> shwaiil: if you want to revert the find's new search on the chain use .end()
[10:15:42] <shwaiil> Cork: thanks a lot :)
[10:15:51] <Cork> np
[10:16:13] <shwaiil> Cork: so something like $(containerElement).find('elementToRemove').remove().end() will revert to containerElement ?
[10:16:29] <Cork> yes
[10:16:38] <nhulea> yo
[10:16:55] <Cork> shwaiil: and unless containerElement is a string you might not have to do it that way at all
[10:17:44] <shwaiil> it's actually markup can I say is a string ? like <div>....</div>
[10:18:04] <shwaiil> because end() here actually returned me TypeError: Cannot call method 'end' of undefined
[10:18:19] <shwaiil> but this may be related with something else, since I'm working with angularjs atm
[10:18:47] <shwaiil> oh sorry typo, I had .html().end()
[10:20:02] <Cork> shwaiil: yes that would be a string
[10:20:19] <marks-c1> anyone recommend a good book for further animation techniques?
[10:20:33] <Cork> shwaiil: personally i prefer to have jquery object variables and work from there
[10:20:59] <ShawnRisk> grafi: this works for me.  Would be nice with nicer code but I am also not using 1.10 but 1.8
[10:22:59] <Cork> hmm oh man that is scary...
[10:24:59] <Cork> window.some_target = $('*').find('#one-specific-element'); will actually create a memory leak...
[10:25:38] <Cork> as it will actually keep every element that happened to be in the page at that time around for the life time of the page...
[10:51:58] <prbc> exit
[11:01:14] <lledet> hi, is there a way to trigger an event that's been set with .on('input') ? I tried calling .input() and .trigger('input')
[11:01:47] <BillCriswell> lledet: There isn't an "input" event as far as I know?
[11:02:23] <lledet> i wish i could change it, but i can't. it's actually working at least
[11:03:08] <BillCriswell> lledet: When does this event file? Might be able to like.. trick it into going by triggering like .trigger('keypress') or something?
[11:03:09] <Brianna1016> Anyone know of a chat plugin for jqm?
[11:04:09] <lledet> it fires when someone types in a text field, so keypress would be logical
[11:04:17] <lledet> just tried .trigger('keypress') no luck
[11:08:15] <alexr2> I'm catching a paste event and preventing the default action so I can format the data before it's pasted in.  I do that with an event.preventDefault(), and then a $input.val(content).  The problem is that the undo history is messed up as a result.  Any thoughts on a workaround for this?
[11:19:39] <shwaiil> I'm finding a render issue on chrome, I've got a <iframe> when I change the src when .ready() I can only see the content if I mouse over it. The content is html5 video btw
[11:19:54] <shwaiil> is there something I can do about it, like a focus or something !? to render
[11:21:51] <Vorspire> shawaiil; quick and dirty, you can try $("iframe").hide().show()
[11:22:00] <shwaiil> Vorspire: cool :) I'll try that
[11:35:27] <shwaiil> About my issue :: I'm finding a render issue on chrome, I've got a <iframe> when I change the src when .ready() I can only see the content if I mouse over it. The content is html5 video btw ::
[11:35:41] <shwaiil> I tried iframe .hide().show() as suggested without success
[11:35:58] <shwaiil> this is just happening in chrome though
[11:43:16] <ericx2x> hey how do i make a break node in jquery?
[11:45:02] <Cork> break node?
[11:45:24] <ericx2x> "Try putting the breakpoint the JS line after the event code"
[11:45:28] <ericx2x> I guess break point
[11:45:35] <ericx2x> Do you think that means break tag in html?
[11:45:52] <Velveeta> they're talking about a breakpoint in your browser's debugger
[11:46:00] <Velveeta> that's not related to the library you're running on your site
[11:49:07] <Cork> ericx2x: ya open your debugger and click the number margin on the left in the source view
[11:49:19] <Cork> ericx2x: that normally creates a breakpoint there
[11:49:35] <Cork> ericx2x: alternatively add debugger; in the source code
[11:50:53] <ericx2x> I'm using chrome's debugger
[11:51:11] <ericx2x> I dont really see anything that lets me click a margin on the left
[11:51:28] <ericx2x> Are you referring to Chrome's elements tab in the debugger?
[11:51:34] <Cork> no
[11:52:31] <Cork> ericx2x: the source view tab
[11:53:50] <ericx2x> the line after the break point is blank
[11:53:55] <ericx2x> and doesnt let me put a break there
[11:54:05] <Cork> so put it on the command
[11:54:26] <Cork> or the next command if there is one in the same function
[11:56:20] <tgodar> so, I get that with .on() if items are added to the DOM later i need it to work 'delegated' and that seems to be done adding the second argument... like this: $('form').on('submit','.inline_bid_form', runnormal);
[11:56:44] <tgodar> but that does not seem to work, had this before: $('form.inline_bid_form').on('submit', runnormal);
[11:57:01] <shoky> tgodar: you delegate to a container element, not to the same element
[11:57:02] <tgodar> works first time but not on the ones I append later
[11:57:04] <Cork> tgodar: the selector in $() must match an existing element
[11:57:09] <Aquaguy> Hello
[11:57:11] <tgodar> ('body')?
[11:57:16] <tgodar> thanks!
[11:57:17] <Cork> for example
[11:57:20] <Cork> or $(document)
[11:57:40] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'selector') is the same as $('selector').live('click')
[11:58:09] <tgodar> was thinking it would work like a find selector and work on the returned forms, that makes more sense though
[11:58:25] <Aquaguy> Is there a way to select odd items by classname?
[11:59:02] <Cork> tgodar: the reason live was removed was cause the syntax it used was severely broken
[11:59:19] <Cork> Aquaguy: sure
[11:59:20] <Aquaguy> Inside a container (div) I have multiple span, some of this spans has class hidden, is there a way to get odd/even elements but without taking into account hidden elements?
[11:59:32] <Cork> $('.class-name:nth-child(odd)')
[12:00:01] <Cork> though they must actually be direct siblings to each other
[12:00:12] <Cork> else you would have to loop the results
[12:00:55] <Cork> for(var i = 1; i < $jqobject.length; i+=2) { $jqobj.eq(i) }
[12:01:52] <Aquaguy> Cork: thanks
[12:02:20] <tgodar> our IDE puts big old strikethu's on <center> yes people still seem to want to use them - sigh
[12:02:27] <tgodar> *yet
[12:03:21] <bekabug> http://pastebin.com/1KLxfibx  if i want to animate this ... what line do I start the animation on?
[12:04:42] <andrew9183> is there a way to bind a function to the show() function?
[12:05:01] <Cork> andrew9183: bind it?
[12:05:22] <Cork> andrew9183: what are you trying to do?
[12:05:24] <andrew9183> well, i want to do something when a div is shown, ie $("div").show()
[12:05:38] <Aquaguy> andrew9183: you can call a function doiing .show( [duration ] [, complete ] )
[12:05:40] <Velveeta> bekabug: animate what aspect of that?
[12:05:58] <andrew9183> ah okay, let me give it a shot.  thanks
[12:06:11] <andrew9183> i wish there was a show event !
[12:06:21] <Aquaguy> complete is a function that is going to be called once the element is shown
[12:06:31] <Cork> andrew9183: you cold add a wrapper around show
[12:06:32] <bekabug> when the content loads i want it to ease open
[12:06:42] <Cork> though then it would be run every time someone used it
[12:06:50] <andrew9183> hmm yeah
[12:07:03] <Aquaguy> if you want to use a event, create one using bind, and then trigger it like .trigger('show')
[12:07:29] <Cork> andrew9183: (function() { var org = $.fn.show; $.fn.show = function() { show.apply(this, arguments); }; })();
[12:07:37] <Cork> opps
[12:07:39] <Cork> andrew9183: (function() { var org = $.fn.show; $.fn.show = function() { org.apply(this, arguments); }; })();
[12:07:59] <andrew9183> ah i see
[12:09:37] <Velveeta> bekabug: is #result hidden at the time you call that load function? if not, you can .hide() it first, call .load() and then in your success callback, just do a .slideDown() or something
[12:10:06] <Velveeta> although if you do that, you won't be able to use your loading gif the way you're using it there
[12:12:39] <garrilla> aquaguy cork "multiple span, some of this spans has class hidden" blah http://jsfiddle.net/tzwFj/
[12:13:14] <Cork> garrilla: what is the question?
[12:14:05] <garrilla> cork it was aquguy's earlier question about multple spans, some hidden, alteneting the css - my solution, with a loop
[12:14:35] <bekabug> Velveeta: result is empty it's just <div id="result"></div>.... it's not hidden. when you click on the link, it loads content from the other page.
[12:14:53] <garrilla> * without * a loop
[12:15:15] <bekabug> if there is a better way of doing this i'm willing to learn. i sort of have no idea what i'm doing and am grasping around in the dark at the moment.
[12:15:59] <Velveeta> bekabug: right, but if you have that css image in it, and the container is visible, then the content is autoinjected into #result, so at that point it's too late to slide it open, because it's already in the container and the container is visible
[12:16:46] <Velveeta> bekabug: what you could do is break that $.load call into pieces… instead of using $.load, use $.get or $.ajax to fetch the content, then remove the css properties on your #results container, then hide it, inject the content yourself, and immediately slide it open
[12:17:18] <Velveeta> the only difference between $.load and those other functions is that where those other functions strictly just load the content of the request, $.load loads and automatically injects the content
[12:17:30] <bekabug> ahhhhh ok
[12:19:45] <Aquaguy> Cork actually it didn't work.
[12:19:54] <bekabug> Velveeta: what would I use to inject the content without load?
[12:20:05] <Aquaguy> I need to select even/odd items but taking into account just the classname
[12:20:14] <Aquaguy> not if they are actually even or odd items in the dom
[12:20:31] <Cork> Aquaguy: that was the for loop
[12:20:42] <Narwhaal> hi, I'm trying to use jquery's offset on an A tag, and this error keeps popping up: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'left' of undefined
[12:21:01] <Narwhaal> I use it like this: $("#"+id+" .formattingButtons .emoticon").offset().left
[12:21:21] <Narwhaal> where "id" is the ID of the button I want the popup to be at
[12:21:48] <Narwhaal> oh nvm I fixed it
[12:21:50] <Narwhaal> thx anyway
[12:22:02] <garrilla> Aquaguy does this not work for you http://jsfiddle.net/tzwFj/ ?
[12:22:02] <Aquaguy> ok
[12:22:31] <Velveeta> bekabug: .html()
[12:23:20] <Velveeta> bekabug: so after you call $.ajax or $.get, in your success function, you'd receive the html response, strip your css rules from #result, and then hide #result, and do $('#result').html(returnedContent).slideDown();
[12:24:36] <Aquaguy> garrilla: That does work, thank you
[12:24:47] <garrilla> np
[12:26:29] <bekabug> Velveeta: http://pastebin.com/kr5FccKJ  is this closer? it doesn't work ... i would guess I haven't named returnedContent?
[12:27:09] <bekabug> oh wait i need to remove some stuff from there. no wonder it doesn't work
[12:29:41] <bekabug> Velveeta: http://pastebin.com/46PCaHJZ
[12:30:51] <bekabug> i'm ddoing this all wrong :(
[12:35:05] <Cork> heh a tricky question if anyone is up for it http://jsfiddle.net/vYS38/ (this is for fun, so no need to look if you don't want to)
[12:35:09] <Cork> find the memory leak :)
[12:35:15] <Cork> (this is NOT a coding style question, the fiddle has been crafted to leak)
[12:36:49] <Narwhaal> so what's the leak ?
[12:37:09] <Cork> each question will leak all the dom elements in the question clone
[12:37:10] <Velveeta> sorry bekabug: got busy at work for a sec
[12:37:27] <Cork> not the question is.. "how" ;P
[12:37:49] <Narwhaal> with a crack in the casket ;D
[12:38:03] <Cork> answers.push(current.find(':checked')) <-- hint
[12:38:11] * Narwhaal too lazy
[12:39:03] <Cork> current.find(':checked') will return the checkbox clicked; but it will also keep a full reference to the original current through current.find(':checked').prevObject
[12:39:31] <Narwhaal> hah I was right
[12:39:33] <Cork> so all the element in each question will have a reference and never released
[12:39:48] <Cork> kinda scary...
[12:41:06] <tyoc213> why a $.ajax with dataType: 'script' and the response will not be executed?
[12:41:32] <Cork> tyoc213: any errors?
[12:41:38] <tyoc213> the console has some console.log("some") but I dont see them, also try with alert("thing")
[12:41:45] <tyoc213> not, I don't see on the server
[12:41:49] <tyoc213> or in the request on chrome :S
[12:42:40] <tyoc213> in fact, the request/response is on the client
[12:42:51] <Cork> tyoc213: is this cross domain?
[12:42:52] <tyoc213> I mean, I see it in the network panel
[12:42:54] <tyoc213> not
[12:43:25] <Cork> is the content-type text/javascript ?
[12:43:40] <tyoc213> for other "options" in the list they work chained... but... I have "this" combination that doesn't work and don't know why because it looks OK to me
[12:43:42] <Cork> (of the response)
[12:43:59] <tyoc213> request headers ccept:text/javascript, application/javascript, application/ecmascript, application/x-ecmascript, */*; q=0.01
[12:44:15] <Cork> i said response
[12:44:23] <tyoc213> response headers Content-Type:text/javascript; charset=utf-8
[12:44:36] <Cork> should work then
[12:44:46] <Cork> you have a link?
[12:44:58] <tyoc213> not, working locally
[12:45:09] <Cork> s/not/no/
[12:45:52] <tyoc213> Oh, I see :)
[12:48:45] <tyoc213> Cork: only this: https://gist.github.com/tyoc213/d429176b597a4ecf1486
[12:49:48] <tyoc213> if you search "content": { you will see that the first line I have is a ugly alert... in other cases, I see it... but I don't know why in this specific request it is not working like the others
[12:50:02] <bekabug> Velveeta: no problem
[12:51:10] <Cork> tyoc213: which one isn't working?
[12:54:17] <jrajav> Has anyone recently gotten the error Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : ?
[12:55:00] <jrajav> I am getting that error in a kind of odd situation - I have a $(document).click handler that fires, and once the handler itself has finished and jQuery takes over for a while, that error fires.
[12:55:07] <tyoc213> Cork: that request on the gist
[12:55:13] <jrajav> I have pored over my code for quite a while and I can't see anything wrong with it
[12:55:15] <tyoc213> I don't see the alert showing up
[12:55:41] <tyoc213> Cork: that is a HAR so with a HAR viewer... don't know if chrome can load saved hars
[12:56:01] <Cork> tyoc213: that is several requests
[12:56:23] <tyoc213> thought it only saved 1
[13:01:25] <bekabug> ok. the data never loads so I am going to assume there is something wrong with : jQuery("#result").get(this.href+" .entry-content", function(data) {   http://pastebin.com/46PCaHJZ   seem like I am on the right path?
[13:01:42] <bekabug> because alert("Data Loaded: " + data); never fires
[13:15:07] <karstenk1977_> hello, can you plz tell me, why the lightbox effect takes only a width of 266px? Klick a chart at http://solarinvert.tom-develop.com/unternehmen/referenzen/
[13:19:14] <Velveeta> bekabug: you still here?
[13:19:48] <Velveeta> if so, i'm in the middle of getting something set up at work w/ someone else, so i haven't had time to get back to you yet, but $.get does not get chained off of result the way you showed in your example, it's run by itself: $.get(blahblahblah)
[13:21:45] <bekabug> so how do i tell it what url to scrape .entry-content off of? i've got 4 links that each go to a different page
[13:34:05] <karstenk1977_> do you know if I can open a image with lightbox from an extern button?
[13:35:23] <jedimind> external how
[13:35:26] <jedimind> like on another computer
[13:35:37] <jedimind> also did you try reading their documentation ?
[13:35:41] <HD|Laptop> when using .when with multiple deferreds (in my case, five AJAX requests), can I use .when(r1,r2,r3,r4,r5).done().fail()?
[13:35:57] <HD|Laptop> or do I have to attach the fail handler to every singe AJAX request?
[13:39:19] <bekabug> I have spent all day one this one thing. can someone else please take a look at it? :(
[13:39:34] <bekabug> http://pastebin.com/46PCaHJZ
[13:39:45] <bekabug> this should not be so hard
[13:39:51] <bekabug> why is this so hard for me hah
[13:40:05] <bekabug> rhetorical, of course
[13:40:52] <HD|Laptop> bekabug: what exactly is your problem?
[13:42:12] <Velveeta> sorry, i'm in and out here, i can give you the high-level overview
[13:42:13] <bekabug> i have a link and when you click the link it opens a loading gif in a div and then goes to the URL of the links (generated dynamically by wordpress) and then i need the jquery to go scrape the contents of .entry-content from the URLs, stick it in a div and animate the opening of the div
[13:42:17] <Velveeta> well there it is :D
[13:42:49] <HD|Laptop> bekabug: ...what?! can you give me a URL where I can see this?
[13:43:01] <Velveeta> so originally she was using $('#result').load, after emptying #result and setting some css on it to display the loading image
[13:43:03] <bekabug> i had all of it working! lol except it wasn't animated and that's where it all fell apart
[13:43:30] <Velveeta> and in her success handler, she was clearing the css background image, but by that point, since she's using .load, the content was already injected, and since #result is visible, there's no nice way to animate it opening
[13:43:58] <HD|Laptop> I mostly don't get the this.href+" .entry-content" part
[13:43:59] <Velveeta> so i told her she should try something like $.get that won't autoinject the content, then on success, clear the css background image, hide #result, manually inject the content, and then slideDown immediately on it
[13:44:13] <bekabug> HD|Laptop: do you mind editing your localhosts file? the staging server isn't publicly available...
[13:44:20] <Velveeta> with load you can pass it a selector string for the chunk of the document you want to target for insertion
[13:44:42] <HD|Laptop> if this.href would be e.g. http://google.com, then the AJAX url would be "http://google.com .entry-content", which doesnt make sense
[13:44:44] <Velveeta> so bekabug, the guy working with me just left for a few minutes, let me see if i can tell you what you need to do here :)
[13:44:54] <bekabug> ok :D
[13:45:51] <Velveeta> hd|laptop: with .load, you can specify the url that way, and jquery will parse it out
[13:46:11] <Velveeta> it'll load the url, examine the content in a jquery wrapper, and inject just the content that matches the selector string
[13:46:17] <Velveeta> so that needs to be manually done w/ $.get also
[13:46:24] <HD|Laptop> aah
[13:46:25] <Velveeta> so bekabug: you wanna do something like this:
[13:46:26] <HD|Laptop> ok
[13:47:46] <Velveeta> $.ajax({url: this.href, type: 'GET', success(markup) { $('#result').hide().html($(markup).find('.entry-content')).slideDown(); }});
[13:48:42] <Velveeta> so you're requesting this.href for the url, receiving the markup in your success function, hiding #result, finding your target ('.entry-content'), setting the html of #result to that markup, and then doing a slideDown animation on #result, which will animate it opening
[13:50:58] <bekabug> i can't use $ with Wordpress... so does: jQuery.ajax({url: this.href, type: 'GET', success(markup) { $('#result').hide().html($(markup).find('.entry-content')).slideDown(); }});
[13:51:00] <bekabug> look right Velveeta
[13:51:34] <Velveeta> inside the success function, you also need to change those $'s to jQuery's also then
[13:52:01] <Velveeta> and that code is untested obviously, i just typed it out here, but that's the idea of what needs to be done to convert that .load into a .ajax request instead
[13:52:13] <bekabug> this is way too complicated
[13:52:24] <bekabug> thank you for your help
[13:56:33] <bekabug> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6863449/problem-with-jquery-easing-animate  am I reading this right? They are basically doing what i want to do...right?

[14:18:08] <Ilovecode121212> hmm, try with on error statement
[14:18:58] <Ilovecode121212> if its an error find another page, or even befor post check if page exists
[14:19:55] <clime> hey jquery file upload plugin uses DELETE method in some example in ajax call for deleting images. Is it safe under IE7/8/9?
[14:21:37] <Ilovecode121212> why dont you just write an ajax query, and delete image by yourself with php unlink. like a boss. instead of using plugins?
[14:22:28] <clime> Ilovecode121212: because deleting is a small part of what plugin actually offers - which is uploading suprisingly
[14:23:19] <Ilovecode121212> well you can upload image with ajax call and then run php script.
[14:23:29] <Ilovecode121212> i just dont like plugins :D
[14:24:08] <Velveeta> i would *think* the delete request type would work fine in IE7/8/9, because there are probably countless restful web services relying on that, with IE users no doubt… but i honestly have no clue
[14:24:27] <kevinklaes1> What's the best way to remove a value from an array that you don't know the index of?

[14:25:57] <Ilovecode121212> i like the splice method , second answer, not sure if it works do
[14:28:59] <clime> Velveeta: ok thanks. I guess the plugin has it handled when it is in the official documentatiton https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Setup   I was just curious, thanks.
[14:30:58] <frank_o> http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Md4kE/ will take each article's title and photo and clone them into #photos_only, give each photo its title's href, and wrap them in .wrapper. But how do I also clone each title into .wrapper?
[14:32:57] <frank_o> Before running wrap(articleTitleLink) I mean?
[14:33:11] <Ilovecode121212> by title you mean text?
[14:33:18] <Ilovecode121212> since they dont have title atribute
[14:33:20] <Ilovecode121212> ?
[14:33:49] <frank_o> Ilovecode121212: Yep the whole .title
[14:34:18] <Ilovecode121212> the whole title or the text between <a>text</a>
[14:34:19] <Ilovecode121212> ?
[14:34:22] <Ilovecode121212> the whole div?
[14:34:29] <Ilovecode121212> or just text between a tags?
[14:34:29] <frank_o> Yep whole thing
[14:34:32] <Ilovecode121212> ok sec
[14:34:38] <frank_o> :D
[14:35:22] <Ilovecode121212> hmm ok do each then jQuery(this).appendTo('#photos_only')
[14:36:15] <frank_o> Ilovecode121212: but it's gotta be within each .wrapper for the existing each
[14:36:29] <Ilovecode121212> $('.article').each(function() {
[14:36:30] <Ilovecode121212> 	jQuery(this).appendTo('#photos_only');
[14:36:30] <Ilovecode121212> });
[14:36:34] <Ilovecode121212> hmm
[14:36:48] <frank_o> Otherwise it would be too hard to relocate each individual wrapper after running the wrap(articleTitleLink) for each
[14:37:03] <petey_> Anyone have any suggestions for how I can get the word "close" to revert back to read more and hide the bio?
[14:37:03] <Ilovecode121212> think im not getting it lemme take look at the code
[14:37:04] <petey_> http://jsbin.com/oKULoYE/1/edit
[14:37:15] <petey_> Right now all that's happening is that it's expanding, but I AM toggling it.
[14:37:30] <frank_o> Ilovecode121212: thanks
[14:37:49] <petey_> .hidden-bio should still be closing even though the text has been replaced, but why doesn't it?
[14:37:57] <petey_> What is it about .replacewith that's stopping this from happening
[14:38:50] <Ilovecode121212> try this
[14:38:51] <Ilovecode121212> $('.article').each(function() {
[14:38:51] <Ilovecode121212> var cont = jQuery(this).clone();
[14:38:51] <Ilovecode121212> jQuery('<a class="wrapper">'+cont+'</a>').appendTo('#photos_only');
[14:38:51] <Ilovecode121212> });
[14:38:55] <Ilovecode121212> didnt test it
[14:39:04] <Ilovecode121212> so fix it if there is an error.
[14:39:23] <frank_o> Ilovecode121212: interesting approach there man!
[14:39:37] <Ilovecode121212> not sure if it will work :D
[14:41:00] <frank_o> Ilovecode121212: hehe.. close enough :D http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Md4kE/1/
[14:41:00] <shoky> petey_: replaceWith removes the previous element (including any event handlers you attached to it)
[14:41:20] <petey_> Even if it still includes the class that's calling it?
[14:41:24] <Ilovecode121212> its an object now
[14:41:25] <Ilovecode121212> meh
[14:41:28] <shoky> petey_: yes.  http://jsbin.com/oKULoYE/2/edit
[14:41:53] <clime> one more question: there is an example how to implement server part for that plugin (jquery file upload) in Django/python. In this example, they send an ajax response (after uploading an image) and they set       response['Content-Disposition'] = 'inline; filename=files.json'  What this line is good for?
[14:42:12] <clime> *json response I meant
[14:43:10] <frank_o> hmmm ye i dunno
[14:43:12] <petey_> Ah I see, thanks shoky - new weapons added to the arsenal woo
[14:43:36] <spellett> indicate what type of data is being passed
[14:43:43] <clime> so my question is: why should 'Content-Disposition: inline; filename=files.json"' be ever needed for json responses?
[14:44:55] <Ilovecode121212> try this frank var counter = 0;
[14:44:55] <Ilovecode121212> $('.article').each(function() {
[14:44:55] <Ilovecode121212> counter++;
[14:44:55] <Ilovecode121212> var cont = jQuery(<a class="wrapper" id="counter_'+counter+'"></a>).appendTo('#photos_only');
[14:44:55] <Ilovecode121212> jQuery(this).appendTo('#counter_'+counter);
[14:44:55] <Ilovecode121212> });
[14:45:27] <shoky> Ilovecode121212 please use a pastebin
[14:45:43] <Ilovecode121212> k sry
[14:45:45] <frank_o> i see i see..
[14:45:52] <Ilovecode121212> just use that logic
[14:46:10] <frank_o> so basically theres no way to do it before wrap(articleTitleLink), we gotta relocate and insert afterwards?
[14:46:22] <s2013> if i have a form that might be hidden or active, how do i change it on click?
[14:46:35] <frank_o> actually kinda cool still though, thanks a lot Ilovecode121212
[14:46:43] <Ilovecode121212> np doode
[14:46:45] <Ilovecode121212> brb
[14:46:55] <frank_o> later!
[14:53:13] <frank_o> Ilovecode121212: Somehow both .title's seem to go into the first .wrapper -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Md4kE/2/
[14:55:23] * frank_o makes a run to starbucks for a quick pick-me-up
[15:01:19] <shoky> clime: i'm not sure but i believe that's to prevent some IE versions from trying to download the file
[15:01:59] <ortund> my ajax posts successfully, but this line (child of ajax->success) doesn't seem to work... $('.errmsg').val('Your email was sent successfully.');
[15:02:35] <ortund> here's a full copy of the code -> http://pastebin.com/1iZXSJdh
[15:02:57] <shoky> ortund: what is .errmsg
[15:02:58] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know how to say in a GET request, that once the GET is triggered to throw up a loading/searching screen
[15:03:00] <clime> shoky: yeah you are very likely right. They mention something about here: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Setup#content-type-negotiation  They not mention setting Content-Disposition. Ill probably just remove the line and test it later
[15:03:49] <clime> shoky: I have implemented the content type negotiation thing so I hope that will be enough
[15:03:51] <diminoten> so I want to append some text to an element, and I want to append that text to the next line
[15:03:56] <ortund> shoky it's a <span>
[15:04:03] <diminoten> but I don't want to put a <br> in my javascript, feels yucky
[15:04:04] <shoky> ortund: then use .text not .val
[15:04:10] <diminoten> is there a trick for getting around this?
[15:04:34] <frank_o> Ilovecode121212: my bad my bad i forgot counter++!! :D
[15:05:20] <ortund> kewl, thanks shoky
[15:06:34] <frank_o> http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Md4kE/3/ does this look fine to the rest of you gentlemen? It now gives each img its .title's href and clone it together with .title into .wrapper.
[15:08:02] <frank_o> * clones
[15:08:02] <frank_o> Yeah I think I'm gonna make a run for the border with this one. Thanks again Ilovecode121212.
[15:08:39] <Ilovecode121212> np doode.

[15:26:45] <thomze^^> can someone help me understand how to set a cookie in this toggle http://jsfiddle.net/NwnpY/ with jquery.cookie plugin? I don't quite get it :( I just want the browser to remember the state of the toggle so it's not closing on a refresh ex
[15:30:27] <sheilablackrose> hi guys anyone alive?
[15:30:31] * diminoten moans
[15:30:39] <Narwhaal> hey a survivor
[15:30:50] <diminoten> is there a trick for avoiding putting html in my javascript?
[15:31:12] <diminoten> like instead of .append('foo<br>bar')
[15:32:36] <sheilablackrose> i have a couple of <li class="showmore" style=""display:none>.  is there away so than when click on the button all li with that class flickers and display one by one
[15:34:02] <Narwhaal> sheilablackrose, jQuery, loop, timer
[15:35:27] <sheilablackrose> any examples
[15:35:27] <sheilablackrose> ?
[15:49:15] <andywww> i have 3 instances of a plugin running on one page and i need to call a function on them all on winnow resize.. sounds simple but i can't work out how to do it
[15:49:19] <andywww> is there a quick answer?
[15:51:10] <jac0bz1_> Is there a simple way to get to the root UL from an LI ?
[15:53:20] <Narwhaal> sheilablackrose, sry I had a shower
[16:05:37] <diminoten> so I have a hidden field I want to cumulatively populate with data as a user fills out a form, and I want to submit that hidden field to my backend
[16:05:50] <diminoten> is there any standard way to store the data while I wait for it to finish populating?
[16:05:59] <diminoten> right now I'm using a hidden field but can I do betteR?
[16:08:30] <diminoten> wait if I just store it in javascript instead of on the page
[16:08:33] <diminoten> am I risking anything?

[18:16:25] <freebirD2> you guys, I'm using a framework, and jquery to validate inputs, so if my field name is 'OPTION' works ok, but when it's called: <input name="data[TEST][OPTION]" >, wont validate the: data[TEST][OPTION]
[18:16:34] <freebirD2> I get an error, and everything stops,
[18:17:02] <freebirD2>   data[TEST][OPTION]:{                required: "Insira uma opo",                minlength: "O seu nome deve conter, no mnimo, 8 caracteres"            },
[18:17:12] <freebirD2> wont validate,
[18:20:03] <freebirD2> anybody please
[18:27:49] <jaroslaw> Hello! I want to understand how handling event, when img's loaded dynamically (without ajax, through $.html('... <img src="some_path"> ...')). I try to handle this event by: $(document).on('ready', 'img', function(){...}), but, it doesn't work always.
[18:31:34] <shoky> jaroslaw: you need to handle the <img>'s "load" event
[18:31:49] <shoky> jaroslaw: and it doesn't bubble iirc, so you can't handle it on $(document)
[18:42:04] <jaroslaw> shoky: like that $('img').on('ready', function(){...} ? and it run for dynamically loaded img's?
[18:46:55] <ericx3x> hey guys how can i do something like this: $('#bluebutton').click( *act as if #redbutton was clicked* );
[18:47:53] <jaroslaw> Hello! I want to understand how handling event, when img's loaded dynamically (without ajax, through $.html('... <img src="some_path"> ...')). I try to handle this event by: $('img').on('load', function(){...}), but, it doesn't work always.
[18:49:31] <jaroslaw> ericx3x: you don't need to if construction. just: $('#bluebutton').click(function(){ alert('Hello, world!'); });
[18:50:01] <ericx3x> jaroslaw i cant just make the function happen
[18:50:12] <ericx3x> i dont really understand how the function i want works
[18:50:37] <ericx3x> its somewhere in some long jquery plugin library
[18:50:49] <ericx3x> but I do know that the function gets trigger by pressing a certain button
[18:51:02] <pixelpimp> !api trigger @ ericx3x
[18:51:02] <b-ot> ericx3x: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[18:51:39] <ericx3x> thanks b-ot that is exactly what i want i think
[18:52:26] <pixelpimp> that is a bot.
[18:52:48] <ericx3x> oh rofl
[18:52:52] <ericx3x> thanks pixel lol
[18:53:29] <jaroslaw> What about my problem? I said something wrong or stupid?))
[18:54:00] <pixelpimp> i'm sure someone may answer it; i'm not that familiar with ajax to be honest
[18:58:26] <ericx3x> For some reason nothing happens when I click on it..
[18:58:33] <ericx3x> Is something wrong with my syntax? $('#bluebutton').click( $('#redbutton').trigger('click'));
[18:58:57] <andrew9183> yes
[18:59:10] <andrew9183> you need to put that in an anonymous function
[18:59:24] <andrew9183> otherwise it'll execute the the click and stick that into the click
[18:59:53] <andrew9183> it should be $('foo').click(function() {$("bar").trigger('click'); });
[19:06:12] <ericx3x> bah
[19:06:18] <ericx3x> that still doesnt work =\
[19:06:38] <ericx3x> can someone try to find the function that makes the slideshow go to the next slide? http://hastebin.com/vupejefogu.php
[19:06:42] <andrew9183> wel you are missing something trivial.
[19:06:50] <ericx3x> andrew9183 no i mean
[19:06:52] <ericx3x> it works
[19:07:03] <ericx3x> but in my case this piece of code didn't solve my issue
[19:07:13] <andrew9183> that is 2500 lines of js.. no one is going to read that.  you have to dumb it down to a simple example

[20:08:20] <ilovecode> you need to check with the conditional statement , so start the load, then finish the load then check if element exist and in that conditional brackets do your code
[20:09:57] <ilovecode> if($('.yourimg').length){ do your code}
[20:10:06] <ilovecode> something like that
[20:18:14] <_andyj_> What format is jquery expecting from an async post?  html?  I am sending a "success" message but it's picking it up as an error, of course it's json format though...
[20:19:37] <Cache_Money> is it possible to click and drag a <p> or <div>?
[20:20:08] <ilovecode> yes Cache_Money
[20:20:48] <Cache_Money> and have the element to stay intact?
[20:21:14] <ilovecode> you can make it stay intact or you can make it resizable
[20:21:55] <ilovecode> _andyj_, did you try   dataType: "json"
[20:22:26] <_andyj_> ilovecode: I have dataType: "json", in the post command
[20:22:28] <ilovecode> dataType (default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html))

[20:24:05] <_andyj_> ilovecode: I'm passing back { 'Result': 'Success' }...  but that is getting handle by error instead of success

[20:26:33] <_andyj_> is it particular on the ' vs " ?

[20:48:04] <odium> I have a very simple site, that uses 36 lines of jquery. However, some parts I don't totally understand and therefor cannot make a certain div fade out, can someone help?
[20:48:28] <odium> I have an example, hosted on this computer if interested. odium.mooo.com:81/
[20:52:02] <jphase> odium: that url doesn't load for me
[20:53:29] <odium> oh, sry. lemme see why
[20:54:44] <odium> jphase. I can tell why, does it 404?
[20:55:03] <jphase> ツ (20:52) jeff@jbox ~/www/ez/public/css (master) $ ping odium.mooo.com
[20:55:03] <jphase> PING odium.mooo.com (146.115.26.230): 56 data bytes

[20:57:39] <odium> hmmm very odd
[20:58:45] <greglaptop> Hi does anyone have experience with bxslider? I installed bx slider, but i get a number control menu instead of a radio type control.. what am i doing wrong?
[20:59:26] <tw2113> have you tried passing in custom settings instead of using the defaults?
[21:00:03] <greglaptop> I have not, i am following the guide... i see pages on examples have it, not sure what i am missing.
[21:00:20] <tw2113> you may very well be getting the default settings
[21:01:10] <tw2113> do they not provide examples of how to change that stuff?
[21:01:35] <odium> jphase, that's supposed to point 146.115.26.230 that's my ip. :(
[21:02:19] <greglaptop> I cannot find one with the default circle selectors...
[21:02:26] <jphase> odium: then I suggest going to freedns.afraid.org and pointing that appropriately
[21:02:34] <jphase> ;)
[21:03:22] <jphase> odium: you have your hosts file pointed by chance? perhaps some router in between afraid.org and myself are not updated...
[21:03:43] <jphase> meh, let me hack my hosts file, sec
[21:04:14] <odium> that seems likely.
[21:04:35] <jphase> same thing happens to me with clients at work. silly routers
[21:04:44] <jphase> caching to make things convenient and all
[21:05:20] <odium> if I want a serious wireless router for legit dd-wrt work, what should I buy?
[21:05:51] <jphase> that might be a question for a different channel heh
[21:06:13] <jphase> I'm not saying it's your router btw, just a router between me and you is all
[21:06:23] <jphase> well, me and afraid.org that is
[21:08:12] <jphase> odium: I just realized that the ip address you mentioned is the same that it resolved to. /facepalm. Uh... do you have port 80 open on your firewall and such? I'm not able to connect to that ip on port 80
[21:11:03] <odium> jphase: I can't get around that port as it is blocked by my isp, but 81 and 82 both worl

[21:12:01] <boink__> hi, can anyone help me with a scope problem I am having with query and ajax? i am new to it
[21:12:24] <jphase> oh, well that's a good bit of info to have hehe
[21:12:35] <boink__> hehe i know
[21:12:40] <boink__> let me paste the code somehwere
[21:13:25] <jphase> odium: ohhhhh sorry, I thought :81 meant line 81 or something, what seems to be the issue?
[21:13:36] <boink__> here it is : http://pastebin.com/1z8gsCnt
[21:14:20] <boink__> the question is:  I need the info returned from the php/ajax  to be applied to all img's inside the (#img_strip p) selector
[21:14:47] <boink__> I couldn't figure it out, so I made an array hoping I could store it there, but it isn't working
[21:15:57] <jphase> boink__: there's a few things I'd do different here, but those things aside, are you able to console.log(phones); after your .done event and see the data you need?
[21:16:45] <jphase> oh sorry, just saw line 15
[21:16:49] <boink__> the console.log (phones); online 15 comes up empty
[21:16:55] <jphase> hmm
[21:16:56] <boink__> but it is outside the ajax call
[21:16:58] <boink__> i am trying it there
[21:17:23] <boink__> agh it might be a timing isaue
[21:17:25] <boink__> issue
[21:17:43] <boink__> new log inside the ajax .done function happens after the code on line 15
[21:17:46] <boink__> that makes sense :)
[21:18:19] <boink__> but I still don't know how to fix this
[21:18:47] <boink__> if I move lines 11 - 16 and put them inside the .done function. it doesn't work
[21:18:59] <jphase> yeah, that makes sense cause the async event won't wait to fire the rest
[21:19:01] <boink__> my guess is $(this) means ajax object on that scope.am i right?
[21:19:08] <jphase> right
[21:19:29] <jphase> so just do something like var ptag = $(this) before your ajax call
[21:19:30] <boink__> so how do I  refer to the "previous" this  (the one in ("#img_strip p")
[21:19:36] <boink__> agh cool
[21:19:38] <boink__> I ll try that
[21:19:42] <boink__> many thanks
[21:19:47] <jphase> then in .done you can use ptag.find('img').each(   yadda yadda
[21:19:48] <jphase> np
[21:20:08] <boink__> marvellous :)  I will try it
[21:20:10] <boink__> thanks!
[21:20:13] <jphase> word
[21:20:45] <boink__> and i don't need that dummy array anymore. woot!
[21:21:12] <jphase> boink__: ooo also, try to use $(this).data('phone', 'yourvalue') instead of using .attr('data-phone', 'yourvalue')    ;)
[21:21:48] <boink__> it would output the same data-phone att?
[21:21:49] <boink__> attr
[21:21:58] <jphase> yeah, data attr's can be set/get from .data
[21:21:59] <boink__> all htmlfivey and all?
[21:22:01] <boink__> :P
[21:22:02] <jphase> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[21:22:03] <jphase> yup
[21:22:10] <boink__> i am awed :)
[21:22:29] <jphase> big ups for using data attributes right out the gate btw
[21:23:06] <boink__> as in "congrats" or ...? not sure I understood :)  (english is not my native lang)
[21:23:15] <jphase> yes, congrats
[21:23:31] <boink__> hehe thanks
[21:24:23] <jphase> odium: what's your issue with fadeOut exactly?
[21:33:00] <jaroslaw> Hello! I want to understand how handling event, when img's loaded dynamically (without ajax, through $.html('... <img src="some_path"> ...')). I try to handle this event by: $('img').on('load', function(){...}), but, it doesn't work always.
[21:42:24] <greglaptop> Hi does anyone have experience with bxslider? I installed bx slider, but i get a number control menu instead of a radio type control.. what am i doing wrong?
[21:43:33] <jphase> jaroslaw: you should bind the load event to the image as it is dynamically created (before you append it to the DOM)
[21:43:51] <odium> jbase, It fades in beautifully.
[21:44:01] <odium> but it doesn't fade out afterward.
[21:44:26] <boink__> have you set a time to it?  (dumb question maybe)
[21:44:36] <boink__> fadeOut(1200)
[21:44:48] <jaroslaw> jbase: but how? i think, my code bind the load event ($('img').on('load', function(){...}))
[21:46:08] <jphase> jaroslaw: for example... $('<img>').attr('src', 'some_path').load(function(){ //do something }).appendTo($('body'));
[21:46:50] <jphase> dynamically create the element, bind the load event to it, then append it to where you would like it
[21:47:13] <jphase> odium: fadeToggle isn't really what you're looking for there
[21:47:41] <jaroslaw> jbase: hm... can I use this without attr()? and why we need appendTo?
[21:48:16] <boink__> jphase i am out. thanks again for your help
[21:48:21] <boink__> see you next time ;)
[21:48:25] <jphase> np, ciao ;)
[21:48:53] <jphase> jaroslaw: appendTo is just an example... .html will set the html of an element from a string. If you want to bind an event to an element and then append it to something, I would suggest doing it similar to how I mentioned
[21:49:46] <jphase> .attr is just an example.    $('<img src="some_path">')    and    $('<img>').attr('src', 'some_path')   are the same
[21:50:42] <Cache_Money> ilovecode: How do I get the image to revert after dragging it? http://jsfiddle.net/WbSzw/8/
[21:51:07] <Cache_Money> I don't want it to stay on the court, I'd like it revert after initial drag
[21:52:42] <odium> jphase. can you suggest a simple animation or fade I can use and what I should rewrite?
[21:52:45] <jaroslaw> jbase: em... I think, I must description it more. My code get from AJAX some information and append it to body. There are several img's. So, after, I want to set plugin on these img's, but I don't know, how I can mention, when they loaded. Your code is reverse: begin - create img, set bind and appent img to body.
[21:53:46] <jphase> jaroslaw: depends on your ajax response really...
[21:54:21] <jphase> jaroslaw:  for example, if your ajax response just had the src of the image...  .done(function(data){  $('<img>').attr('src', data).appendTo($('body'));  }
[21:55:18] <jphase> jaroslaw: if you want help beyond that, I'd need to see an example in a fiddle or something
[21:56:58] <jphase> odium: hmm, try using $(this).fadeOut(800);   instead perhaps?
[21:57:27] <jphase> odium: your .fadeIn(1000); works fine.... the fadeToggle should probably be fadeOut I would think... not sure though, would have to test it out
[21:57:45] <jaroslaw> jphase: I think, there is a little hard in my context. For example. AJAX... success: function(){... context += '<div..>'; context += '<img src...>'; context += '</div>'; $('main').html(context);
[21:57:48] <odium> that's awesome, thanks.
[21:58:09] <jaroslaw> jphase where I can put handler?
[21:59:58] <jphase> jaroslaw: don't convert strings to DOM objects... using .html is not the same as appending a DOM object
[22:00:11] <jphase> sec... I'll show you an example
[22:01:43] <jaroslaw> jphase: Thank you so much. But there is a tonn of code. Can I change the structure a little bit (for appending DOM objest)? I will wait
[22:02:02] <jphase> yes, sec
[22:02:08] <jphase> yes meaning, not a ton of code, sec

[22:03:23] <jphase> that's a rudimentary example of something that you can put inside your success function
[22:03:29] <jphase> don't build a string, then use .html
[22:03:43] <jphase> build a DOM object and bind an event to it, then append/insert it to wherever you need
[22:06:49] <jaroslaw> jphase: But what about tone of code?)) My img's must be placed in middle of content structure. But all of the structure ctreating as string.
[22:07:31] <jphase> jaroslaw: build a DOM object *instead* of creating a string
[22:07:49] <jphase> jaroslaw: if you give me the full code example of the string you build, I can help you build a DOM object
[22:09:10] <jaroslaw> jphase: I think, there is rough shit to restructurized content string. so, I will put in jsfiddle for comfortable seeing to you
[22:10:01] <jaroslaw> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/crELq/
[22:10:04] <jphase> jaroslaw: sure thing. make a fiddle and then click "Collaboration" and I can show you how to rebuild
[22:10:08] <jphase> k
[22:10:41] <jphase> ooo boy, all sorts of stuff in here hehe... http://jsfiddle.net/crELq/#&togetherjs=Kz8E1RmtIn

[22:16:22] <aagii> .val() function is working still or not in 1.10.2?
[22:16:45] <jphase> aagii: yeah it still works
[22:17:49] <aagii> after i changed jquery from 1.4.2 to 1.10.2, somethings not working
[22:18:09] <aagii> $('input[name=selectedEmps]').val(str); this line is not working
[22:18:11] <aagii> and no error
[22:19:04] <jphase> aagii: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/3kH9P/
[22:19:21] <jphase> might be something with your str variable or maybe the selector
[22:21:58] <jphase> jaroslaw: alright, I'm giving up on you now
[22:25:44] <aagii> jphase: i checked the str variable's value by alert(), it's ok. And tried the selector's name to change by id, it is still not working
[22:26:54] <aagii> if there is any error , i can solve that, but here is no error
[22:30:13] <aagii> jphase: now it work, thank you

[22:45:42] <jaroslaw> jphase: how I can append subString to some String, which appending to Body?))
[22:45:44] <jphase> satya22: we won't be able to help you without knowing the error
[22:46:00] <jphase> jaroslaw: you can't append to a string, only a DOM object
[22:46:39] <satya22> http://pastebin.com/z5KaZRGS
[22:47:05] <satya22> it show error message
[22:48:49] <jphase> satya22: I'm not sure how you expect anyone to help you by saying "it show error message". How about starting by including the error message it shows?
[22:49:04] <Cache_Money> Can I not execute a d3.select() within a jqueryui .draggable() function?
[22:49:18] <jaroslaw> jphase: sorry. ok, to DOM. there is: var string = $('<div class="main">'); var subString = $('<div class="section">'); $(subString).append('<img src="blahblah">'); $(string).append(subString); $('body').append(string);  ??
[22:49:40] <jphase> jaroslaw: that looks right, yes.

[23:36:59] <aagii> i have a problem again in 1.10.2
[23:37:09] <aagii> http://jsfiddle.net/T5V2u/1/
[23:40:48] <aagii> .on('mouseover' is working good, but not working in another code
[23:45:41] <aagii> .on(mouseover) event not working on dynamically loaded contents
[23:45:45] <aagii> anybody know it/
[23:59:07] <ServerSage> Stupid question, how do you call trim without the $ shortcut?  jQuery().trim(str) doesn't work.  I'm sure this is obvious...
[23:59:47] <aagii> $(selector).trim()
