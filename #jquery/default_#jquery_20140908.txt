[00:01:19] <kenjim83> does anyone know how to chain 3 of more ajax calls?
[00:16:36] <Rayon> Is it possible with jQuery to select 2 options with one click in a select element?
[00:18:46] <nisseni> I want to remove an element based on a click. The element has the attribute data-color-product-image="25" - is there a way to remove the data element color-product-image with value 25 ?
[00:20:34] <Cork> Rayon: you mean in a multiselect element?
[00:21:13] <Rayon> Cork, Yes i click once and it selects always 2 option elements (instead of having to use shift)
[00:21:35] <Cork> nisseni: $('tag-name[data-color-product-image="25"]').remove()
[00:21:47] <Cork> Rayon: sure you can
[00:21:50] <nisseni> or do I have to iterate all elements of that class and remove the one with that value?
[00:21:56] <nisseni> ah, ok
[00:22:49] <Rayon> And to make it extra difficult :P can you activate this feature based on a dropdown selection (so besides one certain options in a different dropdown box this feature will kick in)
[00:23:22] <Cork> Rayon: never actually tried
[00:23:37] <Cork> but you should be able to do it with a click event handler and a preventDefault call
[00:23:48] <Cork> and then setting the selected list in the select element
[00:26:55] <Rayon> Cork, could you point me into the right direction where should i start looking?
[00:27:22] <Cork> Rayon: look into accessing/setting/updating a multi select element
[01:33:39] <brutzelspeck> hey guys
[01:33:55] <brutzelspeck> I am looking for a way to detect what element is in the center of the screen
[01:35:25] <blackkbot> which center
[01:37:30] <blackkbot> document.elementFromPoint(window.innerWidth/2,window.innerHeight/2)
[01:43:20] <brutzelspeck> blackkbot: thank you!
[01:46:10] <blackkbot> np
[01:46:43] <blackkbot> but thats not the center of the screen to be fair its just the center of the view of the webpage
[01:56:30] <brutzelspeck> blackkbot: that is just what I need :)
[01:58:49] <workerbeetwo> Hi. $('target').html(  ajax.success.data ); does work, but this has an error then the next line is not executed. is the a callback for .html() too ?
[02:00:06] <blackkbot> ajax.success.data throw an error like does not exist kindof thing?
[02:00:31] <blackkbot> whats the error
[02:10:17] <fRAiLtY-> I have an issue whereby if I include jquery in the header, the js files I'm including near the footer aren't functioning correctly, whereas if I simply move the jquery down to above the footer js, they work :S
[02:14:24] <lundy> Good Morning folks, im just wondering if anyone could help me... http://jsfiddle.net/vk22qqku/ in this script I am trying to save the contents of the form and will return the name of the driver who will be driving Car one or two.... what im trying to do is get it to hide the form and display on ONE line "CAR ONE : Drivers Name" but im failing
[02:17:40] <xinming> Is it possible to test wether we have event handlers created with $('#node-wrapper').on('click.blabla', 'a') please?
[02:18:23] <xinming> I mean, How do I check wether  #node-wrapper has always have the click.blabla event handlers registered please?
[02:18:52] <blackkbot> what
[02:20:31] <fRAiLtY-> If I incude jquery at the end of a html page but try and use $(document).ready() before it, that should still work right as it should wait for the document to be ready? i.e. loaded all the scripts
[02:20:34] <blackkbot> getEventListeners(element)
[02:21:00] <blackkbot> well javascript is executed in  order
[02:21:17] <blackkbot> unless otherwise specified
[02:21:19] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: no, cause the .ready function won't exist
[02:21:28] <Cork> also $ won't exist
[02:21:46] <blackkbot> right because jquery is defined after
[02:21:56] <Cork> so if you add jquery at the end of the document, you can't use ready
[02:22:04] <Cork> just add the scripts after it
[02:22:05] <blackkbot> you can but it won't work
[02:22:11] <Cork> wihtou the .ready wrapper
[02:22:27] <blackkbot> yeah you don't need ready if you just add the scripts to the bottom of the body
[02:22:46] <Cork> well .ready is a noop there anyway
[02:23:41] <lundy> :( anyon e able to help?
[02:24:11] <lundy> Good Morning folks, im just wondering if anyone could help me... http://jsfiddle.net/vk22qqku/ in this script I am trying to save the contents of the form and will return the name of the driver who will be driving Car one or two.... what im trying to do is get it to hide the form and display on ONE line "CAR ONE : Drivers Name" but im failing
[02:24:22] <Cork> lundy: separate the backstory from the question
[02:24:40] <Cork> that normally makes it much easier for someone to spot the question, and you are more likely to get an answer
[02:25:10] <Cork> lundy: and your html is invalid
[02:25:15] <Cork> you have two forms with the same id
[02:26:03] <Cork> lundy: also do you want to replace the form elements with uneditable text or what?
[02:26:25] <asturel> actually 4 with same id :D
[02:26:32] <xinming> blackkbot: Test wether there is click event with name blabla bound to specific node.
[02:28:34] <blackkbot> getEventListeners(document.querySelector('specific node selector'))['click'].some(function(e){return e.listener.name === 'blabla';});
[02:28:45] <blackkbot> that right?
[02:29:03] <Rayon> Is it possible with jquery to click one radiobutton and then fill in the value of that element into a input-text and group certain radiobuttons to change a dropdown menu (if it isnt to confusing)
[02:29:07] <Cork> uh no
[02:29:22] <Cork> blackkbot: jquery doens't define getEventlisteners
[02:29:38] <xinming> blackkbot: Isn't there a simple event check which is something like  $('#node-wrapper').hasEvent('click.blabla')   thing?
[02:29:41] <blackkbot> its a google chrome thing
[02:29:48] <Cork> no
[02:30:05] <Cork> the simplest that exist is $._data(elm, 'events')
[02:30:21] <Cork> so $._data($('#node-wrapper')[0], 'events')
[02:30:25] <blackkbot> but thats not simple to undrestand thats just less characters
[02:30:47] <Cork> blackkbot: the big difference is that 1. it exists while getEventListeners doesn't
[02:30:54] <blackkbot> function getEventListeners(node) { [Command Line API] }
[02:30:56] <Cork> 2. it will show jquery events
[02:31:13] <Cork> and that is not always native ones
[02:31:22] <granden> Hi, the datepicker from jquery ui. Is it possible to make some  datesunavailable? Like I would like the user not being able to choose a date that is less then 4 days ahead.
[02:31:51] <blackkbot> yeah this is jquery... clearly i didn't use it when i put document.querySelector
[02:35:00] <t432> I'm trying to display some text once window scroll has gone quarter of length down.
[02:35:26] <t432> not sure how to handle the scrollng
[02:35:54] <blackkbot> idk how jquery helps with this but mobiles don't like the scroll event
[02:37:19] <t432> hmm
[02:37:19] <lundy> Cork, yes that is correct I want to replace the form with uneditable text after its submitted
[02:37:27] <t432> Cork: any ideas?
[02:45:44] <lundy> :'(
[02:46:12] <Cork> lundy: so first you need to replace the id with a valid one
[02:46:40] <Cork> and then you can just do $('#id').replaceWith($('<span>').html(new_content));
[02:46:54] <lundy> ok ... ammmmmmmmm I could replace it with the ID of the Cars
[02:47:11] <lundy> which would like CarID = 1, 2,3,4 ...
[02:48:33] <Cork> lundy: ya, that would work
[02:49:03] <Cork> t432: just bind the scroll event and check the scrollY value from window
[02:49:39] <t432> ah.
[02:51:28] <t432> Cork: I need it to trigger when it it is quarter of the way down, any ideas with regard to the approx value y should be set to?
[02:51:44] <Cork> t432: down what?
[02:51:50] <Cork> down the first screen?
[02:51:53] <Cork> down the page?
[02:51:53] <t432> screen
[02:52:00] <t432> page, rather
[02:52:28] <t432> hmm, whats the difference?
[02:52:52] <Cork> t432: the screen/viewport is the area you see
[02:53:04] <Cork> the page is the end of the entire page (including scroll area)
[02:53:34] <t432> i'll try page
[02:54:06] <Cork> then scrollMaxY / 2 > scrollY
[02:54:22] <t432> and for screen?
[02:54:23] <Cork> or rather the oposit
[02:54:32] <lundy> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/vk22qqku/2/ ... seem to be doing something wrong?
[02:54:39] <Cork> innerHeight / 2
[02:55:17] <Cork> lundy: http://jsfiddle.net/vk22qqku/3/
[02:55:20] <t432> screen = innerheight/2 and page=scrollY / 2 > scollMaxY?
[02:55:28] <Cork> lundy: you made $test a string
[02:55:33] <Cork> it should be the form you want to replace
[02:55:48] <Cork> no
[02:56:15] <Cork> t432: screen = scrollY > innerHeight / 2, page = scrollY > scrollMaxY / 2
[02:56:22] <t432> ok
[02:56:37] <workerbeetwo> blacckbot not exactely. its just the content's error "ReferenceError: googletag is not defined", that has nothing to do with my code. Assume this: JSON (www.jsonservice.com) --> { $('target').html(data) /*works*/ ; console.log("But this line is not fired"); }
[02:57:03] <lundy> ahhhhhhhh get ya now Cork, thanks
[02:57:05] <t432> Cork: are you sure its quarter and not half? (divison by 2 seems dodgy)
[02:57:39] <Cork> ...
[02:57:45] <Cork> t432: sorry thought wrong
[02:57:51] <Cork> yes it should be /4 not /2
[02:58:11] <t432> so I just replace all 2's with 4s
[02:58:15] <Cork> yes
[02:58:17] <t432> ok
[02:58:26] <Cork> the rule is quite logical math
[03:00:45] <workerbeetwo> Cork: Do you know of a callback on $(target).html() ?  liek done or error?
[03:01:14] <workerbeetwo> Cork: I just want to make sure finished loading.
[03:01:39] <Cork> workerbeetwo: there isn't one
[03:01:39] <blackkbot> is .html() async?
[03:01:42] <Cork> no
[03:01:46] <blackkbot> didn't think so
[03:01:53] <Cork> it throws if parsing fails
[03:01:58] <Cork> though html parsing rarely fails
[03:02:01] <Cork> it error corrects
[03:02:03] * Cork gone
[03:03:00] <workerbeetwo> ok. well how am I supposed to have a a function load content and do something with that change after it finished loading?
[03:04:34] <blackkbot> images have a onload event
[03:04:47] <blackkbot> things that are loaded async have onload events
[03:04:52] <blackkbot> typically
[03:06:01] <workerbeetwo> I dont control that foreign content. so I cannot set an Onload event there.
[03:10:00] <lundy> Cork, what can I google to find out how to find what text is in a <label> tag? e.g ?<label>CAR ONE</label> i want to return CAR ONE
[03:11:05] <slax0r> .text()
[03:11:05] <b-ot> slax0r: usually nicer
[03:11:12] <slax0r> o.O
[03:11:16] <slax0r> .text()
[03:11:16] <b-ot> slax0r: usually nicer
[03:11:20] <slax0r> kay
[03:11:53] <slax0r> lundy: you could try: jquery get text from label tag
[03:12:14] <lundy>  $('label#' + $(this).attr('id')).html();
[03:12:15] <workerbeetwo> blackkbot: any Idea ?
[03:13:44] <mooncup> $('label#' + $(this).attr('id')).html();
[03:13:45] <blackkbot> what what
[03:13:51] <mooncup> wtf is that?
[03:14:09] <mooncup> whats wrong with $(this).html()
[03:14:10] <lundy> sorry my bad
[03:14:51] <blackkbot> workerbeetwo you can just put the next code you want to run after literally next
[03:15:02] <workerbeetwo> blackkbot: could I do this?:  $('<div onLoad="continueWhenDone();">').html(data);
[03:15:15] <blackkbot> divs don't load async
[03:15:22] <fRAiLtY-> Anyone here know flat ui ?
[03:16:33] <workerbeetwo> blackkbot: that is, the onLoad would not be triggerd.
[03:17:49] <tomred> I am struggling to get plain HTML content into a query-ui tab.
[03:17:57] <tomred> http://jsfiddle.net/13Lvprp1/
[03:18:21] <workerbeetwo> blackkbot: and what do you mean by "run after litterally next". As said before the next lines are not executed in ...html(data); console.log("I am silent"); wontDo(); ...
[03:18:31] <tomred> Hopefully the paste above will show you what I'm trying to do.
[03:18:50] <blackkbot> you have an error  right?
[03:19:04] <tomred> I have a HTML fragment on the same server's doc but there is no response.
[03:19:30] <tomred> No error but Firebug show the response in red.
[03:19:34] <tomred> With a 200.
[03:19:55] <tomred> but there is no content returned.
[03:21:10] <tomred> The test Tab should get 3 lines of HTML;<h1>...<p>...
[03:21:30] <blackkbot> what i why
[03:21:54] <tomred> Why the HTML?
[03:23:02] <workerbeetwo> < blackkbot> workerbeetwo you can just put the next code you want to "run after literally next"
[03:23:51] <blackkbot> workerbeetwo i asked you a while ago what the error is
[03:24:35] <blackkbot> tomred are you sure you have the pages correct because it appears to be linking to a page giving a 404
[03:25:02] <tomred> Well that URL in internal to my domain.
[03:25:49] <tomred> If I tail log of the http server, I see a access
[03:25:52] <tomred> [08/Sep/2014:11:24:00 +0100] "GET /dp-test.html HTTP/1.1" 200 89 "http://sirius:3000/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:17.0)
[03:26:03] <tomred> 89 bytes are sent.
[03:26:40] <workerbeetwo> blackkbot: reference error, because javascript parts from the foreign content cant be found. of course not.
[03:27:12] <workerbeetwo> blackkbot: but that foreign javascript should not be loaded anyways.
[03:27:57] <blackkbot> but you are putting html in with invalid javascript in it...
[03:29:43] <workerbeetwo> blackkbot: still this method should be able to handle such errors.
[03:33:06] <blackkbot> wrap it in try{} catch(e){} then
[03:37:29] <workerbeetwo> blackkbot: ok thats an idea. but can I prevent the foreign script code from execution ?
[03:41:01] <lemonsparrow> Hi I am trying to add a click event for multiple ids.. but I am getting Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier. can some one help me out pls https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/62c69bccc802c007c2db

[04:23:54] <elmcrest> hi --- is there a convenient way to serialize a hidden element, too? (display:none or visibility:hidden) ... f.e. in case of a disabled input the solution I liked is to just use readonly that serialize fetches the element
[04:26:41] <granden> IS it possible to use the datepicker in UI, to make some dates not selectable?
[04:26:43] <Cork> elmcrest: .serialize should list those elements too
[04:27:03] <Cork> granden: yes it is, you need to extend the plugin though
[04:27:08] <lemonsparrow> hi
[04:27:12] <VectorX> how can i use this http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#alt-field and add the date elements to 3 fields ?
[04:27:15] <lemonsparrow> can anyone help me make this function generic https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/f41e37b74ff72ca81911
[04:27:17] <VectorX> date month and year
[04:27:21] <VectorX> 3 input boxes
[04:27:51] <Cork> granden: http://davidwalsh.name/jquery-datepicker-disable-days
[04:28:07] <granden> Cork: Ok, thank you :)
[04:28:37] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ^ could you help me
[04:28:47] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i don't have the time now
[04:30:05] <elmcrest> Cork here is my html I try to serialize ... every element except the hidden is parsed correctly https://dpaste.de/E7Zv
[04:30:24] <Cork> elmcrest: passed correctly to what?
[04:30:27] <elmcrest> Cork at the moment the css is visibility:hidden
[04:30:42] <Cork> and please use jsfiddle
[04:30:42] <elmcrest> Cork parsed ... serialized correctly into a dict
[04:31:01] <Cork> (make a running example of the parsing problem)
[04:31:12] <OnceMe> Hallo, how can I check if element is viewed on scrolling_
[04:31:17] <OnceMe> halp me now bre
[04:31:35] <elmcrest> Cork jsfiddle is quite a lot to change for me ... at the moment everythin is in one html file ... but I can try that
[04:31:38] <Cork> OnceMe: you would have to calculate the elements top left location on the page + its height/width
[04:31:51] <Cork> OnceMe: and then check if that number is inside the view area of the view port
[04:32:04] <OnceMe> ;[ how to do that?
[04:32:19] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com position
[04:32:20] <OnceMe> there is no way just to trigger checkifviewed function on scroll and check if element is showed
[04:32:21] <b-ot> Cork: .position() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ http://api.jquery.com/position/
[04:32:34] <Cork> OnceMe: no there is no such thing
[04:35:06] <elmcrest> Cork something like that http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=4REsCVBnBL
[04:35:37] <Cork> elmcrest: you need to hit save
[04:36:04] <elmcrest> Cork in this case I expet a value of '' for positem_id ... ah ok sry, now saved ^^ http://jsfiddle.net/7w69p6vd/
[04:36:16] <elmcrest> Cork I mean a empty string
[04:36:20] <elmcrest> *an
[04:36:48] <Cork> uh
[04:36:53] <Cork> position_id is a td
[04:36:57] <Cork> it won't ever be catched
[04:37:00] <Cork> as it isn't a form element
[04:37:12] <Cork> and name isn't valid on td
[04:37:25] <elmcrest> Cork ah ok, so I just make a hidden input, right?
[04:37:29] <Cork> ya
[04:37:34] <elmcrest> Cork nice, thx
[04:37:37] <elmcrest> didn't know that
[04:37:41] <Cork> also you SHOULD have a <form> around things
[04:37:51] <Cork> though that is a bit hard if you have tr for the forms
[04:38:16] <elmcrest> Cork I could generate that within my template engine if that help ... but I would be a table nested into a form ...
[04:38:19] <elmcrest> *it
[04:38:30] <Cork> ya
[04:38:43] <Cork> elmcrest: for user experience you should always have form elements inside a <form>
[04:38:56] <Cork> as browser uses that for field autocomplete
[04:39:02] <Cork> password remembering
[04:39:07] <Cork> some key combos
[04:39:08] <Cork> and so on
[04:39:16] <VectorX> how can i use this http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#alt-field and add the date elements to 3 fields ? to 3 input boxes
[04:39:16] <AdamB> hi. could anyone tell me how on earth I can get the original selector that is used to create the jquery object, from within a plug-in?
[04:39:20] <elmcrest> Cork I see ... ok, good to know, thx again
[04:39:44] <Cork> AdamB: since 1.9 you can't
[04:39:53] <AdamB> how come Cork?
[04:39:56] <Cork> AdamB: there used to be a this.selector member
[04:40:08] <Cork> but it was only needed for the old .live and .die commands
[04:40:20] <Cork> so when those where removed, so where the property
[04:40:39] <Cork> AdamB: if you need the selector, you most likely are creating the plugin the wrong way
[04:40:58] <Cork> and should be taking the selector as an argument to the plugin instead of from jquery
[04:41:05] <Cork> (like .on does)
[04:45:26] <AdamB> ahh that's an interesting idea Cork! my problem has basically come around because I'm working with pushState(), and after a page refresh I need a way of referencing the element again from the state data. but passing the selector as a sting is a good idea
[04:45:49] <AdamB> I will just call my pluin from the global
[04:54:06] <LundyChop> is there a jquery mobile channel?
[04:54:59] <LundyChop> #jquerymobile
[05:00:07] <Tomashe1> hey guys . im trying to solve some issue. i saw in that website http://mouser.com , that even time i put my mouse on the left menu a menu is opened , but the thing is it always position itself as fully visible to me.. so there is no way i need to scroll down to see the popup menu that open on hover unless i really have to. wondering how they did it
[05:04:45] <Expel_> Tomashe:  Just check their code?
[05:04:57] <Expel_> Tomashe1:
[05:07:59] <elmcrest> $.each() is executed twice though there is only a single element to iterate over ... is there a solution to that?
[05:08:31] <elmcrest> I'd like to use each for 1...n elements ... resulting in 1...n calls
[05:08:45] <elmcrest> or iterations if thats a better term maybe
[05:10:21] <Tomashe> Expel_: i can not find the part of that
[05:15:00] <elmcrest> hmm it seems $.each() gets executed n+1 times ... could that be?
[05:19:08] <rgman> elmcrest: $('body').each(function() {alert(this);}); this works fine in the console.
[05:19:32] <rgman> It only displays one alert message.
[05:19:54] <elmcrest> rgman ok thx ... I don't know where my bug is, but it has to be somewhere ^^
[05:21:21] <rgman> elmcrest: Could you send some code?
[05:22:06] <elmcrest> rgman https://dpaste.de/VHgR :)
[05:23:05] <_rgn> Tomashe: their menu could really use the algorithm that checks mouse direction and keeps the menu open
[05:23:24] <sunbeam> how can I check the biggest height of the ul li's ?
[05:24:29] <lemonsparrow> var parentDivId = $(target.closest('div[id]')); returns me an array and not the element.. why so ?
[05:24:41] <lemonsparrow> [div#failed-report-message.mtl.mlml.mrml, selector: ".closest(div[id])", context: a.js-update, constructor: function, init: function, jquery: "1.7.1"…]
[05:24:44] <lemonsparrow> something like this

[05:51:44] <rgman> ubuntulu: I think you should ask about that in #joomla.
[05:52:21] <ubuntulu> yep but nobody know an answer
[05:53:00] <mooncup> well no one here will answer
[05:53:06] <mooncup> its against the rules

[06:12:55] <wodim> hello, do you know of a jquery plugin for something like this? https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-h7fMIJrMCUo/VA2rSdVyNWI/AAAAAAAAg5I/yWBHZ3ar0qA/s0/2014-09-08_15-12-00.png
[06:13:58] <Expel> wodim: You could just style it.
[06:14:22] <wodim> of course, i could do it myself, but i'd rather get it done, that's why i'm asking
[06:14:32] <wodim> i could also use plain javascript instead of jquery
[06:15:37] <rgman> wodim: var $obj = $('..').clone(true, true); $('#button_id').after($obj);
[06:15:53] <rgman> I usually work with something like that.
[06:16:31] <rgman> Never actually felt the need of a plugin for that.
[06:17:46] <rgman> wodim: Sorry.. I made a mistake in the previous... $('#button_id').befor($obj);
[06:18:04] <wodim> omg
[06:23:56] <Rayon> Can anyone explain to me what it adds values: http://jsfiddle.net/3xk7fyz4/
[06:25:40] <elmcrest> I now have a request where I just need some help from some experienced js developer - I see nearly zero chance that I can get this done :/ ... I have a function from stackoverflow to serialize a arbitrary part of my site which works quite nice ... catches everything by name ... now I'd like to extend that function to use something like $(this).autoNumeric('get') in case needed... I could write a class or something to identify the case for example. So
[06:25:40] <elmcrest>  anyone could kindly have a look? https://dpaste.de/n2Se  (and btw Cork I hope dpaste is ok in this case :) )
[06:26:47] <rgman> Rayon: What seems to be the problem in that paste?
[06:38:53] <iSDP> Rayon, rgman, the dropdown's value is prepended in the second <input>
[06:40:29] <prohobo> hey, i'm having a problem with canvases... whenever i redraw a canvas, the antialiasing gets worse...
[06:40:38] <prohobo> until eventually there's no antialiasing at all
[06:40:54] <prohobo> i reset ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = true; everything i redraw though
[06:41:29] <prohobo> nvm fixed it
[06:41:35] <prohobo> the clear rect wasn't working
[06:46:45] <Rayon> Can anyone explain to me what it adds values: http://jsfiddle.net/3xk7fyz4/
[06:57:18] <BillCriswell> Rayon: Hm?
[06:57:47] <Rayon> Bill, are you looking at fiddle (makes it easier to explain)
[06:57:50] <Rayon> Bill, are you looking at fiddle (makes it easier to explain)
[06:57:57] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[06:58:20] <Rayon> If you select a radiobutton it will take the name and a class into the dropdown below it (you see that)
[06:58:52] <Rayon> Click on "Voedingsconsult" (the 9th from the top)
[06:59:01] <Rayon> it changed the dropdown from 10 to 30
[06:59:36] <Rayon> Now when you select a time (at the bottom it puts that "30" or "10" toghter with the choice of time example: 12:30 turns into 1012:30
[06:59:43] <Rayon> I dont want that i just want the 12:30
[07:00:05] <Rayon> I am a jQuery noob so i assume i did something wrong in my code but i have a hard time finding out what
[07:00:36] <Rayon> I feel like it needs to be reset or something (if that is even a thing in jquery)

[07:05:30] <BillCriswell> Rayon: You just want var date = $(this).val();
[07:05:57] <BillCriswell> $('option:selected').val() would grab the first selected option in the whole documents value.
[07:06:06] <BillCriswell> Rayon: http://jsfiddle.net/3xk7fyz4/1/ think this is what you want?

[07:13:27] <Rayon> Bill, Thanks! that was it i now understand what i did wrong i looked at your code!
[07:13:39] <Rayon> thank you so much! It really took me 2 hours to figure it out ahhaha
[07:14:15] <BillCriswell> Rayon: Sweeeeeet.
[07:16:26] <BillCriswell> abailarri: So you want to loop through this and get the user nickname?
[07:17:04] <abailarri> BillCriswell, yes for example
[07:17:12] <abailarri> really I need nickname, id and other dates
[07:17:18] <abailarri> but id different variables
[07:19:49] <BillCriswell> abailarri: They're all in user though, right?
[07:20:24] <abailarri> BillCriswell, see the image and the response in the fiddle
[07:20:40] <abailarri> this is the object that I want to iterate
[07:20:52] <BillCriswell> imgae?

[07:21:09] <BillCriswell> oh, the link.
[07:21:11] <abailarri> in the comment there is a image url
[07:21:12] <abailarri> yes
[07:23:53] <BillCriswell> abailarri: So you have a bunch of these and you want to loop through and output nickname1nickname2nickname3?
[07:25:07] <abailarri> BillCriswell, only I want to get the nickname in the object
[07:25:21] <abailarri> in the user objcet

[07:34:02] <yosito> If I want to serialize HTML form data as JSON am I best off using jQuery? I know there are jQuery plugins out there that can do that, but I'm trying to avoid jQuery as a dependency if it can be done just as efficiently without.
[07:34:51] <BillCriswell> abailarri: No problem.
[07:35:13] <jeffreylevesque> yosito: take a look at https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/html_form_ajax.js
[07:36:08] <jeffreylevesque> yosito: if you want to serialize, then you can further serialize the data within the 'data' attribute in $.ajax
[07:36:24] <BillCriswell> yosito: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11661187/form-serialize-javascript-no-framework first answer here looks good.
[07:36:33] <yosito> jeffreylevesque: Looks like that;s using jQuery. I'm trying to figure out if there's an efficient way to do it without jQuery
[07:37:05] <yosito> Thanks BillCriswell, looks promising!
[07:37:54] <jeffreylevesque> yosito: sorry, didn't see you said no jQuery.  Got a little excited to help
[07:38:15] <yosito> jeffreylevesque: It's all good. :) Thanks for the eagerness to help.
[07:38:16] <jeffreylevesque> since, i seldom help, but always get help in this room :)

[07:52:00] <BillCriswell> fRAiLtY-: <ul class="nav-tabs"><li class="active"><select></li></ul> ?
[07:54:33] <Nomikos> inside #payment-address
[07:54:45] <Nomikos> ehr <* id="payment-address">
[07:56:22] <fRAiLtY-> s'ok, I'm being dumn
[07:56:24] <fRAiLtY-> dumb
[07:56:28] <BillCriswell> Nomikos: I think you left out a big part of your question?
[07:56:50] <drej> like, the question part
[07:58:16] <Nomikos> BillCriswell: all of it, since I was only commenting on fRAiLtY-'s
[07:58:36] <Nomikos> more specifically, on your comment on fRAiLtY-'s question
[07:58:57] <BillCriswell> Nomikos: Ohhhhh
[07:59:02] <BillCriswell> I missed that part of the selector.
[08:21:03] <NoiseEee> whats a good text editor and/or IDE to recommend to a friend

[08:21:16] <NoiseEee> oh, Mac
[08:21:46] <Nomikos> Sublime Text is pretty popular
[08:22:12] <macabre> i have a json object that i'm building a form with.. i loop through each property and create a text input with a value. my issue is, when i click submit the input values do not change. how do i update the values?
[08:22:17] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: I'd agree with Sublime Text.
[08:22:23] <NoiseEee> thanks guys
[08:22:55] * Nomikos is still stuck in TextMate 1 >.>
[08:23:16] <BillCriswell> Nomikos: I was using that for years but I switched to sublime text cause I thought TextMate was dead.
[08:23:42] <BillCriswell> macabre: Sounds strange. Do you have a fiddle set up for this?
[08:24:19] <Nomikos> BillCriswell: I can imagine.. I've got a bunch of customization in this one, it'd take me days to switch properly without any work getting done.. one day.
[08:25:13] <BillCriswell> Nomikos: I keep bundles and stuff to a minimum so it wasn't too bad for me luckily.
[08:26:07] * Nomikos started writing a game that would run in the editor once ..
[08:26:46] <Nomikos> bundle with keyboard shortcuts for every game input, so hacky

[08:35:11] <shadykhan> Hey i got a super quick question. I have a json feed with 100 or so items. What is the best way to make it show every 10th item?
[08:35:43] <Nomikos> shadykhan: http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[08:36:12] <shadykhan> Nomikos: thx
[08:38:14] <jangoh> bbl
[08:39:32] <BillCriswell> shadykhan: Could also use $filter.
[08:39:37] <BillCriswell> .filter() *
[08:40:00] <Nomikos> slightly OT, but does anyone know if JS can refer to the domain it was hosted on, not the one where it's used? (the latter being document.location)
[08:41:00] <BillCriswell> $('.items').filter(function(index){ return index % 10 === 0; }).show().
[08:41:49] <decx> with a large dataset it would probably be more effective to create an array of indexes beforehand instead of going through all
[08:41:53] <Nomikos> I'd hardcode it but the script needs to work while sitting on different domains, and talking back to the same domain
[08:41:57] <decx> indices
[08:42:08] <decx> the hell is the plural of index
[08:42:15] <Nomikos> indices sounds right
[08:42:32] <BillCriswell> True. I just assumed they were already there.
[08:42:52] <decx> i remember reading somethng about a json with 100ish entries
[08:43:21] <drej> 100? thats cute
[08:43:23] <BillCriswell> No you don't.
[08:43:34] <drej> this json object i optimized the other day had like 37,000+ entries
[08:44:06] <decx> yikes
[08:44:24] <drej> yeah that was good times
[08:44:34] <drej> throwing like 37,000 x 5 DOM objects
[08:44:39] <drej> and making sure the mobile device doesnt poop itself
[08:44:51] <BillCriswell> response.filter(function(el, index){ return index % 10 === 0; }); weee
[08:45:08] <BillCriswell> ODB is disgusting in the best way.
[09:03:31] <noober> hi. i am trying to use http://bootstraptour.com/api/ and i cant get it to start as i wish it to
[09:05:21] <noober> i am trying to make the tour start anywhere in the website but when i move to another page, the tour object and all of it's js is erased
[09:06:13] <noober> how can i start the script in one page and have it work on another page (tried using cookies but had some trouble with it)
[09:07:45] <BillCriswell> noober: You can use a cookie or localStoage and set something like "didTour" to true.
[09:09:20] <noober> i am working on a solution of the sort but i thought perhaps there is a way i can save the initialized object and pass it to the next page. it would be much better if that is possible.
[09:09:57] <noober> i don't know much about "localStoage " can i use it to pass the tour object?
[09:10:52] <BillCriswell> noober: You can stringify the object and save it in localStorage and read it on the next page.
[09:13:11] <noober> sounds allright. will that also save its properties? the object has functions related that i need to work on the new page
[09:22:27] <farn5w0rth> how do i include a class in the body. ie how do i do the opposite of this: $("<span class='arrow'><span></span></span>").appendTo("body>*:not(header)");
[09:23:24] <noober> .removeclass('arrow')
[09:24:14] <NoiseEee> farn5w0rth: but... you only have one <body> tag i should hope
[09:24:23] <decx> yuk
[09:24:51] <farn5w0rth> noober: no i want to add a style to a section of the body
[09:25:20] <NoiseEee> a section of the body?
[09:27:18] <noober> what are the characteristics of that section? how is it different than other sections? is it a class, an id?
[09:40:08] <noober> BillCriswell thanks. i got it to work. the cookie simply was not deleted properly because it had a different path from different pages that fired it.
[09:54:02] <borpes> hi everyone. i'm hoping someone might want to share their opinion on something: is there any point in queueing AJAX requests? isn't it sufficient to attempt to make say 200 AJAX requests and allow the browser to chew through them itself?
[09:54:50] <sacho> your question is too vague
[09:55:22] <borpes> which part can i expand upon?
[09:56:22] <NoiseEee> borpes: why would the browser make 200 requests; how large are they, etc
[09:56:59] <NoiseEee> borpes: if you're talking about loading product/event/similar info, it might be handy to have a JS Object ready for querying at page load
[09:58:34] <borpes> they are entities that in local storage from a previous session whilst the user was without an internet connection
[09:59:07] <NoiseEee> borpes: can't you send that in a single request?
[09:59:14] <borpes> the requests are probably each around 300-400 bytes
[09:59:25] <borpes> they could be, yes
[09:59:40] <NoiseEee> probably best to send a wrapper/single request that can be taken care of on the back end
[09:59:48] <NoiseEee> allTheData:{} etc
[09:59:58] <borpes> yeah, i see what you mean
[10:00:34] <sivam> I have a form/page's which is loaded into div / accordion. and I want to track the load event of this accordion/page. is there any event for that ?
[10:01:30] <NoiseEee> sivam: how is it 'loaded'?
[10:01:44] <NoiseEee> if via ajax/xhr, there's the .done hook of the call
[10:02:10] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ @ sivam
[10:02:14] <sivam> NoiseEee: its loaded from another code
[10:02:25] <NoiseEee> sivam: what does that mean though
[10:02:50] <sivam> NoiseEee: I don't have access to that code to call that event directly. I need to track it as separate event
[10:03:32] <sivam> just to track as an accordion when loaded ( instead of populating event - 'callback')
[10:03:40] <NoiseEee> sivam: then presumably you'd have to poll for the DOM elements
[10:04:03] <sivam> NoiseEee: yes exactly.
[10:04:25] <sivam> NoiseEee: what is the way to poll for DOM elements getting loaded / updated ?
[10:04:40] <NoiseEee> sivam: make your own using setInterval
[10:04:55] <sivam> NoiseEee: any example link ?
[10:05:05] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers.setInterval @ sivam
[10:05:16] <sivam> NoiseEee: ThankQ
[10:06:35] <litropy> Hi, there. Could someone please explain to me what "element" truly means in this? I understand index iterates ... that's fine. $( "div" ).each(function( index, element ) { });
[10:06:48] <borpes> NoiseEee: i'll consider asking for that to be implemented in the API in the future, but for now i'd like to keep them as individual requests. i'm aware that i can use the `complete` callback to pop the next item in the queue and perform the request for it, this is what i am referring to as "queueing the requests". i've tested initiating 200 AJAX requests without waiting for them to finish, and the browser works its way through t
[10:07:30] <litropy> And of course it's iterating over each div.
[10:07:32] <NoiseEee> ok borpes
[10:07:40] <BillCriswell> noober: Nice. Sorry I went away from the computer.
[10:07:50] <litropy> Hup ... you know what, I just scrolled to the top of the doc. I'm good.
[10:07:50] <borpes> litropy: the second argument of the callback function is the value of that item
[10:07:53] <wunz> litropy: the current element
[10:07:57] <NoiseEee> litropy: the 'element' is the current div being iterated
[10:08:03] <wunz> litropy: aka $(this)
[10:08:39] <Nomikos> wunz: so, 'this' and 'element' are the same thing inside the callback?
[10:08:53] <Nomikos> (or lambda or..)
[10:08:55] <NoiseEee> not necessarily
[10:08:59] <wunz> litropy: say you have 5 divs, when iterating through each, you need to be able to reference it
[10:10:16] <borpes> NoiseEee: do you know of any downsides to firing off all requests at once rather than queueing?
[10:10:23] <wunz> nomikos: to my understanding
[10:10:53] <NoiseEee> borpes: i think the browser will only make a few number of connections at once.
[10:10:59] <borpes> Nomikos: "(The value can also be accessed through the this keyword, but Javascript will always wrap the this value as an Object even if it is a simple string or number value.)"
[10:11:31] <borpes> NoiseEee: yup, and it will wait until it's able to perform the requests and then it'll do it, it seems
[10:11:48] <Nomikos> borpes: ah, thanks
[10:11:48] <NoiseEee> borpes: i'd say queuing is a bit more elegant
[10:13:59] <borpes> NoiseEee: but sending as many as possible allows for concurrent requests, whereas queueing only allows for one at a time. unless i send five at once for the first request, which will knock on and cause five concurrent requests at all times... yeah... whatever, it's neither here nor there, really... i'll just queue them, sod it :P
[10:15:36] <NoiseEee> ha
[10:18:46] <tcon> hey all. Say I have a page with inputs, and I want to disable all inputs on the page except ones in a specific container. What would be the most efficient way to do that?
[10:19:27] <tcon> ( example: I have 3 inputs inside of a div class="part-1", and then there are 10 other inputs on the page outside of "part-1". I want to disable all of the inputs that are not in "part-1"
[10:20:26] <Nomikos> tcon: there's a not() filter
[10:20:41] <Nomikos> tcon: http://api.jquery.com/not/
[10:22:38] <BillCriswell> tcon: I'd use filter and something like $('input').filter(function(){ return $(this).closest('.part-1').length === 0; }).whateva()
[10:23:46] <borpes> tcon: probably not the most efficient way, but maybe you could use $('div:not(.part-1 *)')
[10:27:07] <tcon> borpes: I'm trying a variation of that, $('div:not(.reportType)').find('input').css('background-color', 'red');      --- however even the inputs in ',reportType' are being affected
[10:27:09] <Nomikos> BillCriswell: you like filter, don't you :)
[10:28:32] <BillCriswell> Nomikos: I sure do haha.
[10:33:26] <borpes> tcon: oops, i think i meant $('input:not(.part-1 *)')
[10:34:32] <the8thbit|work> Hello, I'm using .html() to grab the contents of an ID to be used in reconstructing a part of the page after an ajax call. However, .html() doesn't appear to preserve values held by input and select fields
[10:34:50] <the8thbit|work> is there any way to do this such that that information is preserved?
[10:35:40] <frank_o> Cork: lemme know when ya here
[10:44:41] <borpes> the8thbit|work: you'll probably need to use `val`
[10:45:31] <devoldmx> Hi what would be the best way to detect a click in an iframe element. I don't want to detect events inside the frame, just when a user does something (The iframe is a youtube video)
[10:45:49] <devoldmx> I've tried $('iframe').on('click', function() ... but that doesn't work
[10:47:26] <devoldmx> I wrapped the frame inside a div and doesn't work neither
[10:49:39] <Nomikos> devoldmx: you could try laying an element over it and somehow propagate the click to the underlying iframe.. maybe.. I have no idea if this is possible
[10:49:51] * Nomikos is curious, googles
[10:50:47] <Nomikos> mrph, that'll only work if the overlay is a child of the iframe I guess..
[10:51:14] <Nomikos> and the iframe will probably stop any click events propagating to the div
[10:51:32] <davexunit> hello all, spotted something confusing in the jquery 1.11.1 release (possibly others, too).  wondering if I can get some help to explain why it works.
[10:51:47] <davexunit> removing pretty much all of the source code, the module resembles the following form: (function( global, factory ) { }(window, function( window, noGlobal ) { }));
[10:52:07] <Nomikos> devoldmx: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2381336/detect-click-into-iframe-using-javascript , sorry
[10:52:38] <frank_o> devoldmx: dealing with youtube embeds is a slippery slope - avoid it at all costs
[10:52:43] <davexunit> after the anonymous function definition 'function( global, factory ) { }', there is an argument list.  I thought it was invalid syntax to open an argument list without wrapping the function in parens first?
[10:53:04] <Nomikos> devoldmx: except maybe http://stackoverflow.com/a/23231136/126584
[10:54:28] <frank_o> devoldmx: you'd be much better off displaying a thumbnail of the youtube video and detecting clicks on that. then when its clicked, load the real video
[10:54:31] <davexunit> can anyone shed some light on this?  using a similar pattern fails for me: function(x) { return x + 1; }(1)
[10:54:38] <davexunit> > SyntaxError: function statement requires a name
[10:54:50] <decx> missing )
[10:55:40] <Nomikos> davexunit: try (function(x) { return x + 1; })(1)
[10:55:57] <decx> it'll return into nothingness though
[10:56:03] <devoldmx> @Nomikos @frank_o I think that would be the best approach, to display a thumbnail to detect the event. Dealing with iframes is a pain. Thank you for your help.
[10:56:26] <Nomikos> davexunit: basically you're grouping some syntax to make it easier on the parser, as I understood it
[10:56:26] <frank_o> devoldmx: you could also put an invisible div over the iframe
[10:56:27] <davexunit> Nomikos: yes, exactly!  but notice the jquery source
[10:56:53] <the8thbit|work> borpes: so the only way is to manually grab each val and then manually assign them after the table is recreated?
[10:57:20] <davexunit> Nomikos: it's valid, but it's strange.
[10:57:31] <the8thbit|work> devoldmx: did you try $'iframe').on('focus', function() ...
[10:57:33] <davexunit> the form looks like this (function(x) { return x + 1; }(1));
[10:57:47] <davexunit> for some reason just wrapping in parens like that makes it okay.
[10:58:06] <decx> you can shorten that function like this: 2
[10:58:12] <davexunit> I had no idea that you could wrap parens around the entire expression.
[10:58:14] <Nomikos> the outer params also work, hm. yes. I.. know too little about it, sorry :)
[10:58:22] <davexunit> decx: that isn't the point :P
[10:58:32] <decx> hey just havin some fun here ^^
[10:58:42] <davexunit> Nomikos: thanks anyway.  I had no idea that was valid :)
[10:58:48] <davexunit> anyway, jquery is great.  back to work!
[10:58:53] <davexunit> decx: :)
[10:59:13] <the8thbit|work> Ah, .clone(), perfect!
[11:00:28] <theToastIsDone> im slightly embarassed to ask this.. but on Chrome, how do I check for errors and debuggin information? I'm trying to figure out why something quit working after awhile.. could be permissions on the server though, so I dunno
[11:01:06] <the8thbit|work> oh wait, no, clone gives me the object, and not html as a string :/
[11:01:47] <Nomikos> theToastIsDone: you mean the console/webinspector?
[11:02:49] <theToastIsDone> well, I'm looking at that, and it's not helping... it's sort of complicated
[11:03:53] <theToastIsDone> I'm using Wordpress' popup dialog Media Library.. and it normally inserts the image that the user selects into a <Div> box.. this works fine on my dev computer.. but not on the server.. I think it's permission related, but I'm not sure where to look for it
[11:04:38] <theToastIsDone> i don't think it's a javascript problem, but I wanted to debug that first.. and the only channel I know to look for things is with you guys, because I just about use jquery exclusively in terms of a framework
[11:04:48] <Nomikos> hmm.. it's good to at least know whether it's a client or serverside issue
[11:05:07] <theToastIsDone> it "seems" to be server, but again,. not 100% on that
[11:05:16] <Nomikos> can you check any error logs on the server?
[11:06:10] <Nomikos> theToastIsDone: or compare what the browser is sending to the dev server vs the live server, and what it's getting back
[11:07:04] <theToastIsDone> alright thx, i'll sort it out as much as possible
[11:09:48] <gera3d> Hi everyone.  I had a jQuery question. Who would be a good person to ask?
[11:10:11] <BillCriswell> gera3d: The channel.
[11:11:16] <gera3d> Ok. So I am using the append action to add some HTML. after I click the page uses a call and reloads just the area wihtout reloading the page and I lose the code.
[11:11:37] <gera3d> Is there a command that will apply the load after it makes the call and reloads the area
[11:12:16] <BillCriswell> gera3d: How is it reloading?
[11:12:35] <BillCriswell> gera3d: Why not append the html after the reload occurs?
[11:12:55] <gera3d> I am using .load to add it the first time
[11:13:05] <gera3d> but its not the whole page thats reloading
[11:13:13] <gera3d> just one small video area.
[11:13:20] <gera3d> http://videos.presencelearning.com/
[11:13:26] <BillCriswell> gera3d: so you want to append html to the element after the load?
[11:13:30] <gera3d> I am adding search after the load
[11:13:45] <gera3d> I am already appending the HTML
[11:13:58] <gera3d> I just lose it after I click one of the buttons
[11:14:04] <gera3d> at the bottom
[11:14:19] <gera3d> it does not reload the page so I can't use .load
[11:14:28] <gera3d> it just reloads that area of the page
[11:14:40] <BillCriswell> but you said the html you're appending is getting overwrote by the .load() call, right?
[11:15:26] <gera3d> after I click a button on the video area it makes a new call to Database and gets the HTML again
[11:15:36] <gera3d> so I lose the html I appended
[11:15:59] <gera3d> can I trigger it again with another action and looks for when the page changes?
[11:16:17] <BillCriswell> gera3d: I'm having a really hard time following you.
[11:16:31] <gera3d> ok I will make a quick video
[11:16:39] <gera3d> sorry i am hard to understand
[11:16:45] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:19:31] <litropy> Guys, what is the best way to use a jqXHR object? I need to get key/value pairs from it, but the thing is it's multidimensional, sometimes. Like, there are sometimes more than one person per iteration, and each have, for instance, a name and date born.  Eventually, I need to write html using an iterative loop like, <p>projectName[i]</p> <p>personName[i]</p> /* and that's fine ... I'm just having trouble getting there.
[11:21:00] <litropy> I guess I'm having difficulty deciding where to draw the line as to when I stop using the jqXHR object and when I start pushing into arrays.
[11:21:22] <Fraz> hi
[11:22:38] <Fraz> i have a ui built with jquery, but some sections of the ui should only be available at specific times. Is there any way to surpress all events within a div, such as click and stuff like draggables/sortables from jqui?
[11:24:39] <litropy> Fraz, http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[11:29:07] <Fraz> litropy, i dont want to actually remove the events, just prevent them from firing. For example i dont want any buttons at all in the UI to  be clickable until ive gone to file>new and entered some properties and clicked ok.
[11:31:06] <Fraz> like in photoshop. you cant do anything till youve created a new file. cant transform a layer unless you have one selected
[11:31:16] <the8thbit|work> damn it
[11:31:24] <the8thbit|work> even replaceWith(clone) doesn't work
[11:31:41] <litropy> Fraz, you can bind them back when appropriate.
[11:32:09] <the8thbit|work> oooh it only doesn't work for my select fields
[11:32:14] <the8thbit|work> it works for input fields
[11:32:17] <litropy> Fraz, http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[11:33:15] <ngharo> Don't use bind: As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document.
[11:34:18] <Fraz> litropy, yeah i know, but wouldnt it be inefficient considering id need to continuosly bind and ubind many ui element in between making quick changes within the ui, such as selecting different obtions making parts of the ui avaialable and others unavailable?
[11:34:41] <Fraz> ffs typos
[11:34:51] <litropy> Fraz, I know of no other way. Feel free to wait for others to chime in.
[11:35:02] <Fraz> ok thanks:)
[11:37:34] <ngharo> Fraz: why don't you just set a global boolean and check if it's true or not inside your handlers
[11:38:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone experience with dropzone.js?
[11:38:33] <Fraz> thats a lot of checking. Would have been nice to simple disable all events within a div
[11:38:53] <Fraz> but if its the only option, either that or on/off/bind/unbind i guess ill have to go one of those routes
[11:39:08] <ngharo> you can't disable events from happening afaik, you can turn off your handlers though as litropy stated
[11:40:07] <litropy> Fraz, I also can't comment on the efficiency of said method. I would like to think, resource-wise, it's fine.
[11:42:18] <litropy> Fraz, you can use classes and .each, for instance. $ ( ".unbind" ).each(function () { ... });
[11:43:01] * litropy looks off-screen, through the window
[11:43:24] <litropy> Omg ... I'm actually teaching others jQuery
[11:43:43] <s5fs> litropy: i'm so proud of you today, keep at it!
[11:43:57] <litropy> s5fs, hah
[11:44:29] <s5fs> f'real.. if you ask one question and get an answer, you can now answer the next person with the same question. the cycle continues!
[11:45:14] <litropy> s5fs, pay it forward!
[11:45:18] <gerayeremin> Hi Everyone I was just Here under Gera3d looking for help
[11:45:27] <gerayeremin> Here is the Video I made showing the issue
[11:45:28] <gerayeremin> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16440552/jquary.swf
[11:45:46] <gerayeremin> Your Help would be awesome
[11:47:20] <litropy> Uuuh ... a swf? Wh ... Why did you make a .swf for a jquery issue?
[11:47:42] <litropy> I'm not clicking that. Anyone with a more secure box wanna try?
[11:47:45] <s5fs> litropy: watch the swf, it's totally fine
[11:47:53] <s5fs> I too was skeptical but this is great
[11:48:00] <gerayeremin> I made the video on jing
[11:48:12] <gerayeremin> bit the load was just not working to jing servers
[11:48:44] <gerayeremin> I am not trying to infect you guys just need some help on this
[11:48:56] <s5fs> gerayeremin: why are you appending the html on load? why not include the code up-front and then just show it?
[11:49:18] <s5fs> gerayeremin: also, i LOVE the little video. i haven't seen anyone ask for help like this but it's actually super useful
[11:50:32] <litropy> Yah this is great
[11:50:39] <gerayeremin> @s5fs thanks =D.  I have been messing with this for way to long and I thought it was time to ask for help.
[11:52:36] <litropy> s5fs, I think he's appending the html because it's a theme.
[11:53:00] <litropy> My connection is slow, but I just got to that part.
[11:54:19] <litropy> IT's like, no matter what theme he has, he's going to have that div.
[11:54:41] <litropy> Whoops - it's a class. Those divs.
[11:54:43] <s5fs> gotcha. that was my first thought though, why inject code on page load? makes it more complicated.
[11:59:26] <litropy> gerayeremin, I can't see the code that gets fired when you click a button, but it seems like it's repopulating the nav-tabs-top div.
[12:08:04] <chriys> hi guys does someone knows a good analytics plugin that can help me know from where my visitor are coming during certain hours ?
[12:08:30] <litropy> I didn't know GA even had plugins ...
[12:11:06] <decx> all that info is in your analytics
[12:15:07] <gerayeremin> can someone take a look at this code and share what I am doing wrong http://pastebin.com/pw31cnzz
[12:15:18] <gerayeremin> I want this code to append after I click
[12:20:00] <litropy> I'm using XML, and the tag name is title. $(this > 'title').text(); isn't working.
[12:20:46] <decx> you cant mix and match with this
[12:20:59] <decx> $(this).children('title')
[12:21:38] <dagnabbit> I actually just came in here to ask about 'this'. decx, are you a jquery guru?
[12:21:39] <litropy> thx decx
[12:22:04] <Jattenalle> i'm pretty sure decx is literally jQuery
[12:23:03] <decx> baader meinhofed !
[12:23:22] <dagnabbit> so I've got a script that makes rain on the page. I use it on a pumpkin patch website and whenever it rains they enable a rainy day option in the backend that puts the rain script on the page
[12:23:54] <dagnabbit> However, I just updated their website (WP based) to the latest version and the script no longer works
[12:24:02] <decx> does the rain come from tears of ux people?
[12:24:15] <dagnabbit> lol
[12:24:36] <dagnabbit> They requested it
[12:24:41] <Jattenalle> "pumpkin patch website" ?
[12:25:02] <dagnabbit> Yeah, like a farm that sells pumpkins and has halloween events
[12:25:24] <decx> that's the point where you slap your client in the face and say: that's enough of your shit you stupid bitch*
[12:25:25] <dagnabbit> They are closed when it rains so they have a switch in the backend that activates some jquery
[12:25:37] <dagnabbit> rofl
[12:25:55] <decx> you'd think a moody new background would suffice ^^
[12:25:56] <dagnabbit> window.requestAnimationFrame($.proxy(this.startRain, this));
[12:26:10] <dagnabbit> thats the part thats throwing the error
[12:26:33] <dagnabbit> "Cannot read property 'proxy' of undefined"
[12:26:41] <jQBtstrppr> Hello jQuerians! :)
[12:27:10] <dagnabbit> So I was just reading up on the .proxy() stuff and I'm assuming it doesn't know what the this.startRain is in reference to
[12:27:53] <NoiseEee> dagnabbit: you're already proxy'ing it to this
[12:28:01] <NoiseEee> dagnabbit: window.requestAnimationFrame($.proxy(startRain, this));
[12:28:21] <dagnabbit> http://jsfiddle.net/f90nv9z3/
[12:29:10] <NoiseEee> dagnabbit: ^^
[12:29:47] <dagnabbit> So NoiseEee what would I have to change it to?
[12:29:56] <NoiseEee> dagnabbit: what I just typed ^^
[12:30:18] <dagnabbit> oooooh
[12:30:18] <jQBtstrppr> I need some help with some conflict I am having with creating tabs using jQ UI. I also have Bootstrap 3 on it. What do I do?
[12:31:03] <dagnabbit> Still the same error :-\
[12:31:48] <jQBtstrppr> tabs() works on a tab on page1.html but does not work on another tab on page2.html
[12:32:59] <NoiseEee> dagnabbit: then jquery isn't loaded yet
[12:34:22] <decx> seems pretty sophisticated, where can i see that rain in action?
[12:36:14] <dagnabbit> decx pm me
[12:36:19] <dagnabbit> ill show you
[12:39:22] <dagnabbit> I just confirmed jquery is loaded prior to that file being loaded :-\
[12:39:58] <dagnabbit> Any other ideas?
[12:41:44] <decx> that would'Ve been my guess as well
[12:43:00] <NoiseEee> dagnabbit: it's complaining about $.proxy being undefined, so you can perhaps try jQuery.proxy otherwise debug a little deeper
[12:44:13] <dagnabbit> That produced a new error :)
[12:44:17] <dagnabbit> startRain is not defined
[12:44:41] <dagnabbit> RainDisplay.prototype.startRain = function() {
[12:44:56] <dagnabbit> That proxy line is part of that function ^
[12:46:00] <dagnabbit> So how come it thinks startRain is not defined if it's named right there?
[12:47:49] <NoiseEee> why are you calling the function from itself if its not recursion based?
[12:49:20] <dagnabbit> I didn't write the rain script I just implemented it on the site.
[12:49:43] <dagnabbit> It looks like the author of the script has stopped paying his hosting bill as well because I can't find the demo site now lol
[12:51:38] <decx> well maybe it's time to switch to something that is actually being worked on
[12:51:48] <dagnabbit> Perhaps
[12:51:49] <decx> rainyday.js on git
[12:51:57] <dagnabbit> Yeah I was just looking at that
[12:52:21] <dagnabbit> I think the function is being called from within itself because of the requestAnimationFrame
[12:52:33] <dagnabbit> "Your callback routine must itself call requestAnimationFrame() if you want to animate another frame at the next repaint."
[12:53:51] <dagnabbit> woot woot
[12:53:52] <dagnabbit> fixed it
[12:53:54] <dagnabbit> :)
[12:54:01] <dagnabbit> That was why ^
[12:54:31] <dagnabbit> I used this as an example: http://html5hub.com/request-animation-frame-for-better-performance/
[12:59:50] <dagnabbit> Have you ever farted and came (this) close to pooping your pants
[13:01:20] <dagnabbit> if ( $(body).hasClass('coffee')) { $('.undies').css('color','brown'); }
[13:09:12] <msafi> Guys, if I do element.off('keydown.namespace'), will it turn off a listener that was registered like element.on('keydown.namespace.xyz')?
[13:09:40] <BillCriswell> msafi: I thought events can only go two levels deep with the namespace?
[13:10:03] <msafi> BillCriswell: I have no idea!
[13:10:32] <msafi> I'm gonna see if I can setup a jsfiddle to test
[13:13:47] <msafi> BillCriswell: Apparently, it does turn it off http://jsfiddle.net/5qspn3px/
[13:14:05] <msafi> BillCriswell: uncomment line 8 to see it...
[13:15:57] <walidvb> hello jquery, long time no see!
[13:16:26] <walidvb> i'm looking for a plugin that would render a full-window photo-album like layout
[13:16:36] <walidvb> like you would do in iphoto
[13:19:56] <walidvb> anyone heard of that?
[13:31:45] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to use Snap.svg to simplify my SVG pie animation. But at http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/rv73g1dw/6/ -- how come I can do `var s = Snap(".pie svg");` but not `var pie = $(".pie svg"), s = Snap(pie);`?
[13:35:34] <shoky> frank_o: in the first case you're passing a string to Snap(), in the second case you're passing a jquery object
[13:40:53] <frank_o> shoky: Oh I see
[13:41:38] <frank_o> shoky: I need something like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652763/jquery-object-to-string then?
[13:42:59] <shoky> frank_o: no.. you need to pass in a selector string like ".pie svg".  you can probably also pass an element, e.g.  var pie = $(".pie svg")[0], s = Snap(pie);
[13:43:01] <BillCriswell> frank_o: No. Just do like var pieSelector = '.pie svg'; var s = Snap(pieSelector);
[13:43:03] <shoky> notice the [0]
[13:43:16] <BillCriswell> Oh it takes a string or a dom element.
[13:44:10] <frank_o> shoky: no dice on `var pie = $(".pie svg")[0], s = Snap(pie);`
[13:44:37] <shoky> frank_o: why no dice? works fine on the fiddle
[13:44:51] <frank_o> BillCriswell: unfortunately the real use case is `pie = someExistingVar.find('.pie')` so
[13:44:59] <BillCriswell> Very impatient Mark. :p
[13:45:44] <frank_o> shoky: cant seem to nail it: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/rv73g1dw/8/
[13:46:00] <shoky> frank_o: look at the console.
[13:47:17] <frank_o> :P
[13:47:24] <frank_o> cheerio guys you rock
[14:18:51] <the8thbit|work> How can I tell the object that is being focused on to focus at the end?
[14:19:15] <the8thbit|work> such as with an input field
[14:54:29] <litropy> I'm having a serious amount of trouble handling my XML document. It's definitely there, but I can't work with it.
[14:55:32] <litropy> as in, ajax succeeded, and I can output things to console within the .done function.
[14:55:54] <litropy> But beyond that ... boy. It has been many hours.
[14:57:38] <litropy> I'm about to skip jquery and just do myXMLObj.responseXML.getElementsByTagName('mytag')
[15:28:33] <hackel> I have a form with two buttons with different formactions each posting to a different URL.  I have an OK/cancel confirmation dialogue that is triggered on clicking either of these buttons.  I just can't figure out how to trigger the form submission to the correct formaction when clicking OK on my modal dialogue...
[16:04:27] <nonconvergent> If I want to update some form input elements, what function do I use?
[16:05:04] <nonconvergent> $('#myInputElementId').val("new value")?
[16:07:33] <lucavgobbi> usually yes
[16:08:03] <lucavgobbi> but using id selector '#' you just update one item
[16:08:46] <lucavgobbi> if you want to update multiple items you should use class selector '.' or other selector
[16:26:08] <nonconvergent> Maybe not a jquery question but anyone know how to make an input read only by the user but still submitable by the form? I was told the disabled attribute on the input isn't the thing to use.
[16:33:50] <soixante> Hi guys. If i use jquery.ajax to make a get request to a json file from a different domain, will it work ?
[16:34:44] <soixante> or disabled due to XSS protection ?
[16:39:52] <systemfault> No unless the target domain implements CORS
[16:42:44] <sunbeam> how to best detect with jquery whether user scrolled to absolute top of page ?
[16:49:50] <jasonmerino> sunbeam: $(window).on('scroll', function() { if ($(window).scrollTop() === 0) { // user scrolled to top } });
[16:49:58] <jasonmerino> That's one way. Not sure if it's the best or not.
[17:04:06] <litropy> Could someone please tell me why this is only filling mypeeps[0] ? http://jsfiddle.net/n46f8w9j/1/
[17:06:34] <litropy> When I console.log('name is  ' + mypeeps[1].name + ' year is ' + mypeeps[0].year);  I get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
[17:17:14] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to expand/contract this paragraph by clicking on it: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/8ssrmxwp/1/
[17:17:17] <frank_o> But right now the contraction bit is a click event inside the main expansion click event. This is a bit messy, and causes the whole thing to only work once. Can anybody think of a way to fix it?
[17:29:17] <frank_o> I think I did it: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/8ssrmxwp/3/
[17:29:40] <frank_o> based on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4911577/jquery-click-toggle-between-two-functions
[17:40:39] <hellhound> hey guys, is there a way to create a separate dom hierarchy from an ajax response without actually replacing the current document?
[17:49:49] <jaccob> when you do a form submit with ajax, you use serialize to get all the input values, and on the server side you can access those input values via $_POST["inputName"] ie name="inputName". But if you don't use inputs on the client side, how would you go about manually building inputs and setting their values so they can be accessed the same on the server
[17:50:53] <BillCriswell> jaccob: If you use serializeArray() you can do like.. var data = $('form').serializeArray(); data.push({ name: 'nickname', value: 'Billybob' });
[17:51:15] <jaccob> BillCriswell, thx
[17:51:34] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[17:52:01] <jaccob> BillCriswell, and then in your jquery ajax post, you would have the line data: data
[17:52:09] <BillCriswell> jaccob: Yes.
[17:52:58] <jaccob> BillCriswell, so basically, the server accepts a form post as an array of elements in the form { name: 'nickname', value: 'Billybob' }
[17:54:29] <BillCriswell> jaccob: For the most part.
[17:54:52] <jaccob> BillCriswell, but for an http request, you want to use serialize not serializeArray
[17:55:41] <BillCriswell> jaccob: You can use either.
[17:56:09] <jaccob> BillCriswell, oh great, thx again
[17:56:23] <BillCriswell> serializeArray is just easier to work with.
[18:01:35] <kylereese> hi, can someone help me please with JQuery question/bug ? I have created a JS Fiddle so you can regenerate my bug:   http://jsfiddle.net/qwb0de9v/   please uncomment rule 14 and 16, and you will see the result is entirely different, i dont understand? :(
[18:06:30] <BillCriswell> kylereese: .done(dfd.resolve(9)) The resolve() here would run immediately and not wait for .done to happen like you seem to want.
[18:07:29] <shoky> kylereese: it's because you have an async callback inside a for loop. by the time the .then() callback is called, the loop is already long finished, and "objGame" will point to the last item
[18:07:53] <shoky> kylereese: use .forEach instead  http://jsfiddle.net/qwb0de9v/2/
[18:09:09] <kylereese> shoky thanks a lot, i think i understand, i'm going to try some stuff out, it's my first week with deferreds, this helps a lot
[18:09:26] <shoky> ok just understand that this issue has nothing to do with deferreds
[18:09:46] <shoky> for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { setTimeout(function() { alert(i) }, 1000) }
[18:10:00] <shoky> that will alert "9" ten times
[18:10:24] <kylereese> ok i see
[18:10:31] <shoky> er "10"  ;p
[18:10:48] <kylereese> that's a bid dumb of me, i spend half a day on this bug searching on the wrong place i suppose!
[18:11:01] <shoky> it's ok, it's a common js error ;p
[18:12:26] <BillCriswell> There's so much about defereds I don't get.
[18:12:46] <Velveeta> oh boy! that's one of my spe-cia-lities
[18:13:26] <BillCriswell> I think I'd need to find a situation where I need them to understand them haha.
[18:13:44] <Velveeta> once you understand them, you find all kinds of opportunities to use them
[18:14:32] <kylereese> BillCriswell i recommend you this book: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030508.do i have read it today
[18:14:46] <kylereese> a book entirely dedicated to jquery deferreds
[18:15:20] <BillCriswell> They'd better be REALLY useful if I'm going to read a whole book about them ahha.
[18:15:26] <shoky> kylereese: btw usually you'd want to "return dfd.promise()"   from the function,  so on the outside all you have is a promise (not a full deferred)
[18:15:31] <kylereese> Velveeta would you ever use deferreds on normal functions that don't have any ajax calls in them?
[18:15:49] <shoky> kylereese: instead of calling .promise()  on the returned deferred like you did
[18:15:49] <Velveeta> absolutely
[18:16:04] <kylereese> shoky ok thx
[18:16:29] <Velveeta> i used to limit myself to deferred usage only in conjunction with ajax functionality, but they're beautiful for any kind of asynchronous code, not just requests
[18:18:57] <kylereese> shoky i've just implemented the change in my application and it's finally running again there were it would always crash :-D you saved my day
[18:19:05] <shoky> can't wait for ES6 to be mainstream so everybody can ditch their own promises implementations
[18:19:10] <shoky> esp. jquery :D
[18:19:46] <shoky> glad i could help, kylereese
[18:20:11] <BillCriswell> shoky: Whats the big difference between how ES6 and jQuery handle it
[18:20:12] <BillCriswell> ?
[18:21:42] <BillCriswell> Like it is extremely different or small things?
[18:22:24] <shoky> BillCriswell: welp it's not so much ES6 as the fact that it's standardized, and most everyone else except jquery has followed Promises/A+ or whatever its called standard, which is different from jquery's - mostly with regards to error handling
[18:24:03] <shoky> in jquery it's pretty bothersome to propagate errors in promise-chains, don't even remember if they do anything when an exception is thrown
[18:26:04] <shoky> and with ES6 also it's implemented by the browser itself so there should be lots of room for performance optimizations
[18:26:28] <BillCriswell> Oh nice.
[18:27:28] <BillCriswell> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/ reading through this now to see if anything clicks.
[18:29:53] <shoky> pretty long read, that ;p
[18:30:31] <BillCriswell> Yeah figuring that out a bit late.
[18:30:44] <BillCriswell> OSX and that hidden scroll bar tricking me.
[18:31:30] <shoky> heh
[18:43:20] <BillCriswell> Ugh, so much to learn.
[18:43:52] <shoky> BillCriswell: btw donno if this helps any for understanding promises, but a while ago i made this primitive promises implementation to demonstrate to a friend. it can only be resolved, no failures ;p   http://jsfiddle.net/Qb7eK/1/
[18:44:13] <shoky> shows you how simple promises are, conceptually at least
[18:45:16] <BillCriswell> shoky: This helps a lot .
[18:45:33] <shoky> awesome
[18:46:16] <BillCriswell> Thanks
[18:46:36] <shoky> shure thang
[18:49:35] <shoky> actually looking at it again, it's a pretty shitty example
[18:49:38] <shoky> :D
[18:51:41] <shoky> i mean, it only very artificially resembles a promise
[18:52:01] <BillCriswell> shoky: I think it's enough for me.
[18:52:26] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[19:00:59] <shoky> BillCriswell: a bit better :\  http://jsfiddle.net/Qb7eK/2/
[19:04:06] <BillCriswell> shoky: Still making sense, which is good.
[19:04:44] <shoky> ;]
[19:34:06] <codepython777> can someone point me to a good number selector for numbers between 0-1000?
[19:35:17] <BillCriswell> codepython777: Do you want the first 1000 elements of a certain type?
[19:36:02] <BillCriswell> What does the class look like? Think I need more details.
[19:36:20] <codepython777> BillCriswell: I just need a number selector. 0 - 1000
[19:36:24] <blackkbot> what is a number selector? like a lotto ?
[19:36:26] <codepython777> integer
[19:36:52] <BillCriswell> codepython777: >= 0 && <= 1000 ?
[19:37:06] <BillCriswell> codepython777: What you're asking is confusing me.
[19:37:07] <blackkbot> parseInt(Math.random()*1000)
[19:37:27] <BillCriswell> blackkbot: Ohhhhhhhhh
[19:37:36] <blackkbot> idk if thatas what he wants
[19:37:42] <codepython777> I need a ui widget for that.
[19:37:50] <BillCriswell> blackkbot: Makes the most sense...
[19:40:37] <blackkbot> that is just a variable that is randomly generated
[19:43:50] <shoky> codepython777: http://jqueryui.com/spinner/ ?
[19:46:09] <codepython777> shoky: that design is pretty bad for selecting 0-- 1000
[20:40:59] <teufelChiCoder> hi everyone, i'm using this plugin: http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/ - and I'm trying to get date ranges to workâ€¦and no luck, i've got this set up so far: http://jsfiddle.net/9tLubyzq/15/
[20:42:52] <teufelChiCoder> anyone eles dealt with this plugin?
[20:43:31] <ManBearPixel> teufelChiCoder: What isnâ€™t working, just curious
[20:43:43] <teufelChiCoder> the mindate on the second field
[20:44:01] <teufelChiCoder> i.e. if i choose 10/11/2014, then in a second field that shoudl be a start date
[20:48:39] <teufelChiCoder> i.e. can't have end date before the start date
[21:08:01] <jaccob> store.js sucks cause lots of browsers are in private mode by default. so what is better to use?
[21:31:42] <teufelChiCoder> >,<
[23:17:13] <schnoodles-a> Is it possible to do something like -- $('[data-sortable=*]')
[23:21:04] <Cork> schnoodles-a: remove =*
[23:24:53] <schnoodles-a> Cork, Yeah I thought it didnt work the first time but it was the line before it erroring. Thanks.
