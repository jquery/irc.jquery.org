[00:00:28] <djQuery1> cypha: and unless that code is at the end of you page you might want to wrap it in a $(document).ready(function(){ code here });
[00:00:42] <djQuery1> cypha: something in the 2nd chapter of the referenced book
[00:01:39] <cypha> djQuery1: i had that code at the top of the page
[00:02:20] <cypha> within <script> </script>
[00:02:33] <cypha> and then made this link:  <a href="#mylinkbutton">click</a>
[00:02:37] <cypha> didn't work though
[00:02:43] <cypha> what am i doing wrong?
[00:03:07] <djQuery> cypha: meaning the browser would run it as soon as a script was encountered ie. before you div or link where there.
[00:03:09] <djQuery> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal-form
[00:04:08] <andrewjackson> ?eval var test = "testing"
[00:04:09] <bot-t> andrewjackson: undefined
[00:04:21] <andrewjackson> ?eval alert();
[00:04:21] <aximilation> ok cypha part of you issue:
[00:04:22] <bot-t> andrewjackson: No output.
[00:04:41] <andrewjackson> ?eval document.cookies
[00:04:41] <bot-t> andrewjackson: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[00:04:42] <cypha> djQuery: that doesn't help, i'm not sure what's wrong with what i have
[00:04:51] <m0dmd> Hello everyone.
[00:04:51] <aximilation> you define the variable 'id' (bad name IMO) as $(this).attr('href');
[00:05:01] <djQuery> cypha: see ?demo
[00:05:01] <bot-t> cypha, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:05:15] <cypha> aximilation: i removed that script cuz djQuery was showing me a 1 line script
[00:05:32] <aximilation> you then use that variable as you would use a normal id, eg: $(id/obj) which probably won't work
[00:05:35] <aximilation> ok
[00:05:52] <cypha> djQuery: http://69.84.109.187:6543/login
[00:06:24] <cypha> aximilation: this one is one line long and still not working
[00:06:28] <djQuery> cypha: are u referencing jquery ui?
[00:06:37] <djQuery> dont look like it
[00:06:43] <djQuery> did you check the debugger?
[00:06:54] <cypha> djQuery: i'm referencing jquery
[00:07:14] <andrewjackson> what seems to be the problem here?
[00:07:17] <aximilation> well it's looking for #mydiv which does not appear to exist.
[00:07:42] <aximilation> it's also looking for a css file to determine how to display the popup
[00:07:47] <coldhead> var spaces = Spaces.featuredspaces[index].spaces; // LOL needs more spaces
[00:07:50] <djQuery> cypha: well .dialog is part of jqueryui you need to add a reference to its js file as well as one of its css files
[00:08:43] <cypha> djQuery: does jqueryui need jquery.js also?
[00:09:19] <djQuery> cypha: yes.
[00:09:21] <andrewjackson> cypha: http://jqueryui.com/download
[00:09:37] <andrewjackson> sorry I meant http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[00:09:52] <djQuery> cypha: hence the links to the demos that I gave so that you could view the source and instructions
[00:11:10] <andrewjackson> you could even use this to include it in your code: http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jqueryUI
[00:11:50] <andrewjackson> I'm not a big fan of their fancy downloader on the jquery ui site
[00:11:52] <djQuery> andrewjackson: +++ I always try to use the cdns
[00:12:17] <djQuery> andrewjackson: you only need that if you want to customize the theme
[00:12:29] <andrewjackson> ya... lol
[00:12:42] <andrewjackson> but from what I would tell, it was the only way to download it =\
[00:12:47] <andrewjackson> I always just used the cdns
[00:12:56] <cypha> djQuery: which jquery. file?
[00:13:11] <cypha> something within development-budnle?
[00:13:29] <cypha> oh, dialog?
[00:14:28] <andrewjackson> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.14/jquery-ui.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[00:14:41] <andrewjackson> cypha: just do that, it's so much easier
[00:14:48] <cypha> still not working
[00:15:00] <coldhead> try restarting your browser?
[00:15:14] <andrewjackson> no
[00:15:18] <andrewjackson> you are missing core
[00:15:30] <andrewjackson> dialog has dependencies
[00:15:49] <cypha> shouldn't be missing now...
[00:15:54] <cypha> i added <script
[00:15:54] <cypha> src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.14/jquery-ui.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[00:17:03] <xirewire> Hi anyone who can help me with a self written plugin jquery?
[00:17:24] <cypha> still not working
[00:17:27] <andrewjackson> all you need is <script  src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.14/jquery-ui.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> and...
[00:17:33] <andrewjackson> the jquery core
[00:17:42] <cypha> i have both
[00:18:05] <aximilation> cypha: your code is still missing html
[00:18:15] <andrewjackson> get rid of the other two, it's giving my an ugly 404 for the script files
[00:18:19] <cypha> what must the html say?
[00:18:28] * aximilation facepalm
[00:18:41] <cypha> andrew, what other two?
[00:19:52] <andrewjackson> okay...
[00:19:54] <aximilation> did you look at this? http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal
[00:19:59] <andrewjackson> you're missing the dialog html...
[00:20:11] <djQuery> cypha: you need the link that andrew posted as well as the css files.
[00:20:13] <andrewjackson> you're trying to make a dialog out of an anchor
[00:20:33] <cypha> oh
[00:20:58] <cypha> so how would i make a dialog in html?
[00:21:20] <djQuery> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/06/jquery-ui-1-8-14/
[00:21:32] <cypha> djQuery: i''m using the link andrewjackson posted already
[00:21:58] <andrewjackson> one sec, I'll get you an example
[00:22:00] <djQuery> cypha: I only saw him post the link to the javascript file. you need a link to the css file as well
[00:22:15] <djQuery> andrewjackson: dont bother got one
[00:22:15] <andrewjackson> oh ya, I forgot about that. lol!
[00:22:21] <andrewjackson> oh okay
[00:22:50] <andrewjackson> well.. I was just gonna right it for you, but okay then lol
[00:22:52] <cypha> which css file?
[00:23:08] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/
[00:23:18] <djQuery> look at the files referenced in there
[00:23:41] <djQuery> you can switch out base for whichever theme matches your site
[00:24:05] <djQuery> <link  href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
[00:24:12] <djQuery> cypha: ^^^^
[00:24:59] <andrewjackson> that jsbin site is pretty cool =]
[00:27:50] <cypha> still not working
[00:27:53] <cypha> =/
[00:28:14] <cypha> i put the js code you gave me in popup.js
[00:29:19] <cypha> djQuery: ^^
[00:32:25] <RockMeAmadeus> I'm looking for an insertInto function like the .append function, I'm putting something between <h1></h1>
[00:32:56] <fuchstronaut> $('h1') .html() .text() or, .append()
[00:33:14] <fuchstronaut> html and text will overwrite h1's content
[00:33:36] <RockMeAmadeus> i'll use .html because thats what i'm actually putting between the tags
[00:33:54] <andrewjackson> appendTo()?
[00:34:16] <fuchstronaut> then you should go with either html or append/prepend
[00:35:02] <fuchstronaut> $('h1').append('p') will do the same like $('p').appendTo('h1') i think
[00:35:25] <andrewjackson> ^yes
[00:35:31] <andrewjackson> likewise you could do...
[00:36:25] <andrewjackson> $('h1').append('<div>asdasd</div>'); or $('<div>asdasd</div>').appendTo('h1');
[00:37:01] <andrewjackson> there's so many possibilities... it's kinda confusing
[00:37:10] <andrewjackson> I almost wish it weren't so dynamic
[00:37:19] <RockMeAmadeus> I thought append would result in <h1>Old h1 contents</h1><new content>
[00:37:20] <aximilation> lol, just pick one
[00:37:34] <RockMeAmadeus> I ended up using append because it was less to write
[00:37:55] <djQuery> cypha: get it workin yet?
[00:38:08] <cypha> nope
[00:38:16] <djQuery> it would help if you actualy had something called mylinkbutton on your page
[00:38:25] <RockMeAmadeus> No firebug on firefox 6 is a pain for me so far
[00:38:29] <andrewjackson> append/prepend puts content between the working element
[00:38:48] <RockMeAmadeus> thanks andrewjackson
[00:38:52] <andrewjackson> np
[00:39:30] <cypha> djQuery: do i change the word 'hello' to 'mylinkbutton'?
[00:40:12] <djQuery> cypha: or vice versa
[00:40:26] <djQuery> and are you trying to dialog the contents of the link?
[00:41:52] <cypha> i didn't consider that, but anything that works is fine at this point
[00:43:44] <cypha> there's no link, how will it be triggered to pop up?
[00:44:33] <Renex> hello
[00:45:47] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/erosiv/edit
[00:45:56] <djQuery> cypha: ^^
[00:46:04] <Renex> I have a <select> tag where the option's are colors. What I intend to do is to change the background of a <div> when I go over any of the options, without selecting it. how can i do this in jquery?
[00:46:37] <pallet> can some people help me and just go to oscommerce.purchaseseal.com and look about a bit, I'm testing a stats engine
[00:47:57] <djQuery> cypha: http://jsbin.com/erosiv/2/edit
[00:48:14] <djQuery> Renex: see ?.change
[00:48:14] <bot-t> Renex, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[00:49:24] <cypha> djQuery: no popup still
[00:49:26] <andrewjackson> cypha: here go http://jsbin.com/okufit/edit
[00:49:52] <djQuery> andrewjackson: I won
[00:49:59] <andrewjackson> oh oops lol
[00:50:03] <andrewjackson> oh ya?
[00:50:05] <andrewjackson> well...
[00:50:07] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/erosiv/2/edit
[00:50:10] <andrewjackson> how long did that take you?
[00:50:19] <andrewjackson> took me like...
[00:50:24] <djQuery> not long
[00:50:26] <andrewjackson> 1 min ;]
[00:50:26] <Renex> djQuery: I have used change, but that is not what i need because change only works when I select an option. What I want it to do is to change the background of the <div> when I hover an <option> not when I click on it
[00:50:28] <djQuery> 1.5 min
[00:50:56] <djQuery> Renex: $('option').hover()
[00:50:57] <andrewjackson> ok, maybe it took me like 2 min lol
[00:51:12] <djQuery> andrewjackson: mine has a pretty button
[00:51:26] <andrewjackson> mine uses his template
[00:52:00] <Renex> djQuery: thank you. that is exactly what I needed :)
[00:52:06] <djQuery> andrewjackson: yeah mine makes the incorrect assumption that he can extrapolate what he needs to do frome the sample given
[00:52:27] <cypha> omg thank god
[00:52:33] <cypha> and djQuery and andrewjackson
[00:52:44] <cypha> finally working
[00:52:47] <andrewjackson> =]
[00:53:05] <cypha> now i  can play with it tomorrow to see how it functions
[00:53:10] <cypha> THANKS!
[00:53:15] <cypha> goodnight
[00:53:22] <andrewjackson> cypha: j curious, how long you been using with javascript?
[00:53:45] <andrewjackson> oh wow, I must be tired
[00:54:08] <datarecall> how can i hook all .submit's
[00:54:20] <datarecall> like to do all hrefs i do $("a").click
[00:54:39] <andrewjackson> datarecall: $('input:submit')
[00:54:47] <djQuery> andrewjackson: I have a little experience with dialog http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/paStV/
[00:55:17] <djQuery> datarecall: $('form').submit(function(){});
[00:55:38] <andrewjackson> nice
[00:56:37] <andrewjackson> actually, I wonder if it's quicker to do $('form').find('input:submit')
[00:56:56] <andrewjackson> not sure... to be honest...
[00:57:05] <andrewjackson> I've only been using jquery for a couple days
[00:57:31] <andrewjackson> but been using javascript for years
[00:59:12] <andrewjackson> currently writing a very simple splitter addon that utilizes resizable and position... but I wonder it would be best to dumb it down to draggable instead of resizable
[01:00:14] <djQuery> andrewjackson:  nopers that wont work for this example form.    <form name="nosubmitbutton" method="post" action="mytest.php"><input name="whatever" /></form>
[01:00:26] <djQuery> andrewjackson: but the form will work just fine
[01:00:53] <andrewjackson> oh, I think I misunderstood the question then
[01:01:14] <andrewjackson> I thought he was looking for all <input type="submit" />
[01:02:08] <djQuery> think he was but he was making an incorrect assumption that all submits happen via a button
[01:02:35] <andrewjackson> oh
[01:03:11] <djQuery> well if you wanted some code to run on the button and different code to run on the actual submit but I would just do it in the form submit
[01:04:02] <andrewjackson> true... actually... depending on what I'm doing, I would put my code in the event aswell
[01:04:18] <andrewjackson> unless he was just trying to apply css
[01:04:44] <andrewjackson> which... is kinda silly too.. because then you could just use...
[01:04:45] <andrewjackson> well...
[01:04:47] <andrewjackson> css
[01:05:27] <djQuery> xcpt some browsers wont do stuff like :hover
[01:05:58] <andrewjackson> ya, then we go back to the events like you said lol
[01:06:08] <andrewjackson> personally...
[01:06:22] <djQuery> http://saveie6.com
[01:06:25] <andrewjackson> if I want's hover effects on an input, I would make it work with css
[01:06:37] <andrewjackson> as little js as possible
[01:06:43] <andrewjackson> I'll make an example
[01:11:50] <andrewjackson> djQuery: http://jsbin.com/umoqek/edit
[01:12:02] <andrewjackson> it's not pretty, but you see how it's possible
[01:12:08] <andrewjackson> works in all browsers
[01:12:59] <djQuery> andrewjackson: :hover dont work in ie6 at all
[01:13:07] <andrewjackson> really?? lol
[01:13:10] <andrewjackson> that's news to me
[01:13:23] <andrewjackson> I must have been under a rock
[01:13:43] <xec> :hover works on a elements only in ie6
[01:13:59] <coldhead> oh IE, you so crazy
[01:14:16] <andrewjackson> you need to use "a:link:hover"
[01:14:21] <andrewjackson> I just remember
[01:14:32] <andrewjackson> well...
[01:14:38] <andrewjackson> iirc
[01:14:39] <djQuery> http://www.kavoir.com/2009/01/css-selectorhover-hack-for-ie6.html
[01:15:25] <andrewjackson> now that I think about it...
[01:15:41] <andrewjackson> I have NEVER used ":hover" for anything other than anchor, because of it's lack of support in IE6
[01:15:54] <andrewjackson> so my example does work in ie6
[01:16:22] <andrewjackson> infact... before Google Chrome, my browser of choice was IE
[01:16:53] <andrewjackson> just never liked Mozilla's attitude and Opera was nice, but too different
[01:17:05] <andrewjackson> and Apple... you know how that goes
[01:18:30] <coldhead> you're a weird man or woman, andrewjackson
[01:18:36] <andrewjackson> indeed
[01:18:39] <coldhead> and an unforgettable president
[01:19:14] <andrewjackson> I fixed this damn economy once! wth man!
[01:19:53] <andrewjackson> youngsters gone and messed it up again
[01:23:08] <andrewjackson> djQuery: now that I think about it... I think you're right that it wouldn't work in IE6...
[01:23:37] <andrewjackson> I think I tried this method before, and I couldn't get "background-color:transparent;" to work on inputs
[01:23:52] <datarecall> does anyone know how you can get an exit pop and window.location in chrome to work, seems like they stopped allowing it
[01:23:54] <andrewjackson> or something very minor that just messed the whole thing up
[01:25:51] <coldhead> andrewjackson: djQuery is almost invariably correct :)
[01:26:07] <djQuery> not realy
[01:26:09] <andrewjackson> datarecall: are you talking about the onUnload event?
[01:26:24] <datarecall> yes
[01:26:47] <coldhead> your "not really" is one of the rare exceptions to the rule, djQuery
[01:26:49] <andrewjackson> there's most certainly an event for this that works in chrome
[01:26:49] <djQuery> coldhead: if that were true I wouldnt spend so much time beating my head on the desk
[01:27:08] <andrewjackson> djQuery is being modest lol
[01:27:13] <coldhead> djQuery: that's between your head and the desk, #jQuery seldom learns of it
[01:27:21] <andrewjackson> lemme find it datarecall
[01:27:48] <datarecall> andrewjackson its not the unload even that isnt working sec ill pastebin
[01:28:12] <andrewjackson> oh... is the cancelling of the default action?
[01:28:44] <andrewjackson> all I use these days is chrome, and I've seen it many times in different sites
[01:29:23] <datarecall> http://jsfiddle.net/xYzLA/ its the location.assign that is not working in chrome
[01:30:25] <andrewjackson> okay one sec
[01:30:27] <andrewjackson> I got this
[01:30:28] <luaa> hey
[01:30:35] <luaa> I have a fast question
[01:30:39] <luaa> how do I call this function?
[01:30:41] <luaa> http://homework.nwsnet.de/news/9132_put-and-delete-with-jquery
[01:30:42] <datarecall> thanks andrewjackson ive been googling for 20 mins
[01:30:58] <Kichael> what's a good pagination plugin?
[01:32:47] <coldhead> CHERNOBYL, FACT
[01:34:37] <andrewjackson> datarecall: I think it's as easy as this http://pastebin.com/grw9hEyL
[01:34:42] <andrewjackson> seems to be working fine for me
[01:35:29] <datarecall> yes its the location.assign that chrome is blocking
[01:35:35] <andrewjackson> oh, I forgot your window.location detail >.<
[01:35:36] <datarecall> the actual popup works
[01:35:40] <datarecall> :)
[01:37:10] <andrewjackson> still on it
[01:38:12] <datarecall> im sure someone has hacked something up just cant find it anywhere
[01:38:34] <andrewjackson> okay...
[01:38:40] <andrewjackson> I see the problem
[01:38:48] <andrewjackson> let me get this straight
[01:39:08] <andrewjackson> what you are trying to do is display the popup if it is an external link, and not if it is internal?
[01:39:36] <datarecall> yeah that all works fine though, basically the popup will load and as the popup loads redirect to another url
[01:39:42] <datarecall> but it seems chrome has blocked this
[01:39:45] <datarecall> ff and IE works
[01:40:23] <andrewjackson> the only thing I don't understand is the location thing is of the event function
[01:40:43] <andrewjackson> *inside of
[01:41:36] <andrewjackson> if I assign a location via an anchor or a button or even a div, then it triggers the poppup
[01:42:07] <andrewjackson> but why would you want to assign the location if you are already on your way somewhere?
[01:42:26] <datarecall> if they refresh the page
[01:42:29] <datarecall> click the back button etc
[01:42:32] <sasori> question: is there an existing function in jquery where in i can check the value  if it's alphanumeric of not?
[01:42:52] <andrewjackson> true returing true instead of "on your way to google"
[01:42:55] <muszek> hi... Github's pages update the whole location bar (not just the part after #) without reloading the page. Example: https://github.com/nathansearles/Slides (browse the tree, click on some directory - examples or source).  Any idea on how they do it?  Is there some nice juqery plugin that helps achieve it?
[01:43:04] <andrewjackson> *try returning
[01:43:23] <muszek> I've seen it on some other websites as well, can't remember which ones, though
[01:43:44] <andrewjackson> wait oops lol
[01:43:51] <andrewjackson> that didn't make sense lol
[01:44:00] <andrewjackson> I'm pretty tired
[01:44:01] <m0dmd> anyone know how to achieve the fixed navigations that lock to containers so they don't overlay content?
[01:44:18] <Cork> muszek: it does reload
[01:44:37] <Cork> and browser doesn't allow you to modify the none hash part of the url without reloading
[01:44:41] <Cork> *browsers
[01:45:22] <andrewjackson> m0dmd, you're loading from cache... that's why it doesn't seem to reload
[01:45:38] <m0dmd> wrong person :)
[01:45:39] <andrewjackson> datarecall: I suggest using multiple functions
[01:46:02] <m0dmd> anyone know what that type of navigation is called?
[01:46:06] <andrewjackson> ooooooooookaaaay.... that's my que for bed hahaha
[01:46:06] <muszek> Cork: I'm looking at network tab of Google Chrome's developer tools and only one small file is downloaded
[01:46:30] <m0dmd> it's fixed but as the page scrolls it locks to a container so it does not block content.
[01:46:38] <Cork> muszek: well i get the url change listed here
[01:46:55] <andrewjackson> muszek: you're loading from cache
[01:47:06] <Cork> muszek: and it would be a BIG security hole if a browser let the browser change what the url says
[01:47:08] <andrewjackson> you're probably using firefux
[01:47:21] <Cork> *let the webpage change
[01:47:41] <andrewjackson> cork is correct
[01:47:55] <andrewjackson> tho it would be cool, just isn't good
[01:48:01] <Cork> ya
[01:48:19] <muszek> thanks for clarifying, guys
[01:48:50] <andrewjackson> muszek: try holding ctrl and clicking something
[01:48:51] <sasori> question: is there a built-in alphanumeric validation fuction in jquery ?
[01:49:05] <andrewjackson> not sure if that does what ctrl + f5 does
[01:49:33] <andrewjackson> oh nm, that opens new tabs lol
[01:49:45] <muszek> :)
[01:50:18] <andrewjackson> shift + click should force it to load the page instead of cache
[01:51:18] <andrewjackson> m0dmd: can you clarify?
[01:51:45] <andrewjackson> oh... I think I understand
[01:51:54] <andrewjackson> what you could do is...
[01:52:15] <muszek> something smells not right to me... how come the slide animation starts right after I click on the link?  when the heck is that page reloading?
[01:52:27] <andrewjackson> actually, just use margin
[01:52:28] <djQuery> <input type="text" validation="[1-9][a=Z]
[01:52:35] <djQuery> " />
[01:52:42] <m0dmd> andrewjackson i forgot where i found this feature
[01:53:09] <m0dmd> basically if the navigation is scrolled past, it will display it in the next container
[01:53:12] <m0dmd> an so on...
[01:53:15] <djQuery> ?g html5 input validation
[01:53:17] <bot-t> djQuery, Web Forms - Dive Into HTML5 - http://diveintohtml5.org/forms.html
[01:53:31] <andrewjackson> you mean those orange bars at the top on stackoverflow.com?
[01:54:10] <andrewjackson> oh... you're probably going to need to use mousewheel events
[01:54:19] <m0dmd> nope
[01:54:47] <m0dmd> let's say you have a long page, with a floating navigation
[01:55:03] <andrewjackson> where is the navigation located on the page?
[01:55:05] <m0dmd> and you don't want it to overlay content, it will attach itself to the nearest container
[01:55:30] <andrewjackson> so it's a jumping navigation?
[01:55:38] <m0dmd> i wonder if that's the keywork
[01:55:42] <m0dmd> a jumping navigation :)
[01:56:08] <djQuery> position: fixed
[01:56:29] <andrewjackson> hmmm
[01:56:41] <m0dmd> yea djQuery position fixed
[01:56:44] <m0dmd> but that overlays content
[01:56:51] <andrewjackson> I'd need to see an example to see exactly what you mean
[01:56:56] <m0dmd> there are many sites with this feature but i can't remember them :( gg
[01:57:00] <m0dmd> it's easy to imagine
[01:57:05] <andrewjackson> I think I get the concept
[01:57:11] <m0dmd> imagine fixed positioning and as you scroll
[01:57:14] <m0dmd> it overlays content
[01:57:30] <andrewjackson> you keep saying that... lol
[01:57:30] <m0dmd> which you don't want. So the feature makes it move into the nearest container
[01:57:35] <aaairc> if i do    $('#div1').addClass('style1') ... and then do $('#div1.style1').css('height', 500) ... and then $('#div1').removeClass('style1')... and then $('#div1').addClass('style1')   ---> will #div1 end up with a height of 500 or will that css styling i did be removed when i do the .removeClass?
[01:58:32] <Cork> aaairc: the height is set inline on the element
[01:58:33] <andrewjackson> I would google jquery collision detection, and attach some example I found to the document's scroll event
[01:58:46] <Cork> aaairc: so what class you add doens't matter unless it has !important
[01:59:30] <aaairc> Cork: oh ok. so if i wanted to remove that inline style that i set what would i have to do?
[01:59:34] <andrewjackson> I think "collision detection" would be the keywords
[01:59:40] <m0dmd> searching it up now
[01:59:44] <m0dmd> thanx andrew
[01:59:47] <andrewjackson> np
[01:59:50] <m0dmd> enjoy your rest bud
[01:59:55] <andrewjackson> thx lol
[02:00:11] <aaairc> Cork:  $('#div1').css('height','')  ?
[02:00:11] <Cork> aaairc: you set it to the value you want
[02:00:11] <andrewjackson> now I can sleep... you got me going to stackoverflow...
[02:00:22] <andrewjackson> and I seem my reputation quadrupled
[02:00:27] <andrewjackson> and I'm too excited to sleep now lol
[02:00:28] <Cork> aaairc: that might work, but i'm not sure
[02:00:40] <andrewjackson> *I can't sleep
[02:00:54] <m0dmd> rofl
[02:00:56] <aaairc> Cork: like i want to temporarily override the CSS style... and then revert back to the original CSS style... do you know how to do that?
[02:01:51] <Cork> aaairc: if your not doing animations, most of the times its farter to just have an additional class
[02:02:25] <aaairc> Cork: but i won't know ahead of time what the height it is i need to set the div too... so i can't just add a class
[02:03:03] <Cork> aaairc:ah
[02:04:20] <Cork> aaairc: i had to test it :)
[02:04:29] <Cork> and ya resetting it with an empty string works fine
[02:04:44] <aaairc> Cork: ah cool. i was in the process of trying to test too :)
[02:05:00] <Cork> aaairc: never had to do it in jquery :)
[02:05:03] <andrewjackson> okay... gn guys
[02:05:08] <Cork> and that problem is another beast in plain js :)
[02:09:03] <beevi7> is there a way to determine if a function has already been bound to an element?
[02:09:40] <Cork> $(elm).data('events')
[02:10:16] <Cork> beevi7: best is to suflix your eents
[02:10:18] <Cork> *events
[02:10:27] <Cork> that way you can handle it easily
[02:10:28] <beevi7> ah cool. thanks
[02:12:09] <Cork> beevi7: i mean like $(elm).bind('click.my-events'); $(elm).unbind('.my-events')
[02:16:01] <Paganini> hello I'm a bit stumped with the most simple of problems :P I'm using $('body').css('height', 'auto'); when a button is clicked to try and resize the popup size back to what it started at before I appended and then emptied an element but it doesn't appear to work using auto OR pixels :/
[02:19:23] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Paganini
[02:19:23] <bot-t> Paganini, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:19:53] <Paganini> well it's a bit difficult bot-t because it's a chrome extension
[02:20:03] <Paganini> client side popup
[02:20:10] <ravenzz> np
[02:20:34] <ravenzz> you should paste just the code snippet in question
[02:20:47] <Paganini> sure :)
[02:20:55] <beevi7> can i recognize if a webkit browser is chrome or safari?
[02:21:06] <beevi7> $.browser only says webkit=true
[02:21:16] <beevi7> and yes, even $.browser.safari is true in chrome
[02:22:24] <Paganini> this is it in essence http://jsfiddle.net/P9gpK/2/
[02:22:50] <Paganini> it's probably something weird with the chrome extension system as it has a max width of 800px and max height of something similar to that
[02:23:05] <Paganini> I just want the box to auto resize back to what it was upon clearing the data
[02:24:45] <ravenzz> beevi7 http://jsfiddle.net/NpaUm/
[02:25:13] <ravenzz> beevi7 but maybe there is a better way to do that.
[02:26:26] <ravenzz> Paganini what box are you talking about?
[02:26:28] <beevi7> ah. sure. thank you
[02:27:29] <ravenzz> Paganini the extension's popup box?
[02:27:40] <Paganini> the box itself is chrome extensions API, when you click the extension the html file is called
[02:27:56] <Paganini> I may have found the answer somebody mentioned that you have to set both body AND html at the same time
[02:27:59] <beevi7> another question: is it valid to append a new <style /> node with .text("p.foo:after {content: 'foo: ';}"); to a document or is there a nicer way to set properties for pseudo elements?
[02:28:02] <Paganini> I thought it was just my shoddy jquery call :D
[02:28:20] <kurisu> could someone possible look at this --> http://jsfiddle.net/eUxU2/ for me please.. got a problem with the init() { returnMediaObject(firstMediaListItem) } part of the code... I know that returnMediaObject() works because it does for the $('#pml_media_list_more').click(function() {... }
[02:28:34] <beevi7> ah, probably i can just do $('p.foo:after').css(). lol
[02:28:51] <ravenzz> ?css @ beevi7
[02:28:51] <bot-t> beevi7, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[02:28:55] <ravenzz> of course
[02:29:25] <ravenzz> Paganini is your console reporting any error?
[02:29:37] <ravenzz> do you include the jQuery library?
[02:29:51] <cna> hi i am having a form with two form elements one is text field another one is file upload input box.Am trying to submit a form through ajax using jquery plugin ajaxForm(),but the probelm am not getting the uploaded file on the server side this is code snippet http://pastie.org/2308168
[02:29:59] <kurisu> the init part of my code doesn't POST anything for some reason
[02:30:00] <cna> am doing anything wrong here
[02:30:04] <Paganini> ravenzz yeah I do
[02:30:09] <ravenzz> Paganini i don't have any html/event to try
[02:30:16] <Paganini> ravenzz I know that's the problem :P
[02:30:17] <beevi7> ah. and what can I do if I'm iterating through a nodeset? $.each($('p'), function(k, el) { if($(el).hasClass('foo') { $(el).filter(':after').css(); }}); or what?
[02:30:21] <Paganini> and I can't create one either.
[02:30:35] <ravenzz> ok
[02:31:06] <ravenzz> did you try to set the height by plain js?
[02:32:03] <ravenzz> i mean: document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].style.height = '100px'
[02:32:09] <Paganini> I've just tried document.body.style.width="100px"; AND document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].style.width="100px"; but when the buttons clicked it just flashes madly at me
[02:32:16] <Paganini> heh was probably reading the same article
[02:32:25] <Paganini> oops, height...
[02:32:26] <Paganini> of course haha
[02:32:49] <Paganini> woo that works :)
[02:32:55] <Paganini> however I need to click twice to get it to execute, odd
[02:33:49] <ravenzz> dunno, i can't help you more
[02:34:03] <ravenzz> without trying
[02:35:13] <Paganini> yeah that's cool, thanks for your help anyway, it's not even a jquery issue to be fair
[02:36:05] <cna> how to handle a upload file in jquery ajax
[02:36:23] <kurisu> does this look right? --> var firstMediaListItem=$('#pml_media_list li').eq(0).attr('id'); returnMediaObject(firstMediaListItem);
[02:38:12] <Cork> coa: in modern browsers you can use the File object
[02:38:30] <Cork> coa: but older browsers (all ie's) don't support that at all
[02:38:54] <beevi7> any idea why $('summary:first-child:before').css({"content":"foo"}); isnt working?
[02:38:57] <Cork> coa: and then you need to use things like flash/silverlight/iframe or so on
[02:39:07] <beevi7> summary:first-child:before { content: "foo";} works fine
[02:39:32] <Cork> beevi7: i don't think you can create before statements with jquery
[02:39:57] <beevi7> you're probably right :D
[02:40:12] <beevi7> i tried $('summary:first-child').before('foo');
[02:40:20] <beevi7> but that breaks everything?! :/
[02:49:27] <coldhead> i'll finite state machine YOU
[02:49:57] <kurisu> does this look right? --> var firstMediaListItem=$('#pml_media_list li').eq(0).attr('id'); returnMediaObject(firstMediaListItem);
[02:51:58] <coldhead> it looks like it might work but the variable names are pretty gross
[02:52:39] <coldhead> "return" in a function name is awkward
[02:52:49] <Cork> i think thats a missed space
[02:54:29] <kurisu> oh right... I'll try it...  I really hope thats the problem.... been confising me for awhile now
[02:56:28] <coldhead> eagle eyes, Cork
[02:56:56] <Cork> :)
[02:58:06] <kurisu> missed space before $ ???
[02:58:59] <coldhead> Cork? fix it fix it fixitfixitfixit
[02:59:23] <Woet> i've been looking over it 5 times now, i don't see a missing space
[02:59:36] <Woet> so either i'm blind or Cork is lying
[02:59:42] <Cork> Woet: returnMediaObject should be return MediaObject
[02:59:51] <Woet> ah
[02:59:53] <Woet> i read it as a function
[02:59:54] <Woet> without a return
[03:00:00] <Woet> because coldhead said  "return" in a function name is awkward
[03:00:03] <coldhead> how DARE you call Cork a liar
[03:00:11] <Woet> maybe he named his function returnMediaObject!
[03:00:19] <kurisu> i did name it that
[03:00:21] <Woet> see
[03:00:23] <Woet> pwnd Cork
[03:00:25] <Cork> Woet: that why i said i guess :)
[03:00:25] * Woet celebrates
[03:00:27] <kurisu> becasue thats what the function does
[03:09:20] <kurisu> does this look better ---> displayMediaObject($('#pml_media_list li').eq(0).attr('id'));  <-- still doesn't work
[03:14:52] <Paganini> revenzz, if you ever come across it again $('body').height(200);$('html').height(200); not within a called function does the job :)
[03:15:06] <Paganini> in that order
[03:15:52] <coldhead> lol Woet
[03:16:11] <Woet> ?demo @ kurisu
[03:16:12] <bot-t> kurisu, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:16:46] <coldhead> kurisu: try using console.log or even alert to see where it's failing
[03:17:55] <coldhead> console.log($('#pml_media_list li').eq(0).attr('id'));
[03:18:09] <coldhead> console.log($('#pml_media_list li').eq(0));
[03:18:23] <coldhead> and so on
[03:23:01] <kurisu> ok thanks
[03:23:05] <kurisu> i'll try
[03:23:50] <kurisu> Woet: I did try a jsfiddle but because my code is fetching from mysql it's a bit pointless
[03:24:02] <Woet> kurisu: OR provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:24:11] <BlaDe^> is this correct? : $('<option id="code" />').val('test').appendTo(list);
[03:24:17] <kurisu> site is hidden atm
[03:24:34] <kurisu> ... under onstruction... login only
[03:24:59] <Woet> kurisu; then do as coldhead said, debug it.
[03:25:08] <kurisu> maybe I'll create a login if I can't figure it out myself
[03:25:19] <kurisu> thats what i'm trying now... thansk
[03:26:01] <coldhead> BlaDe^: i would write it as $('<option />', {val: 'test', id: 'code'}).apendTo(list)
[03:26:15] <BlaDe^> haven't seen that syntax before, cool
[03:26:18] <coldhead> value* rather
[03:26:37] <coldhead> yeah it's really nice, especially if you need to reuse the properties
[03:26:38] <BlaDe^> and appendTo ;)
[03:26:48] <coldhead> OH SHUT UP
[03:26:57] <coldhead> IT'S MY FIRST DAY USING JQUERY
[03:27:00] <coldhead> AND YOU'VE MADE M CRY
[03:27:01] <Woet> keep your head cool, coldhead
[03:27:03] <coldhead> ME*
[03:30:50] <BlaDe^> hahah coldhead - is it really ?: )
[03:30:54] <BlaDe^> any ideas about this one guys: list.find('option[value="' + folder_id + '"').remove();
[03:30:56] <BlaDe^> do I need the @ ?
[03:32:58] <coldhead> the @ is deprecated
[03:32:59] <coldhead> so no
[03:33:12] <coldhead> but i would use ?filter
[03:33:12] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[03:33:20] <BlaDe^> hmm I got it working by doing: list.find("#folder_" + folder_id).remove(); --- not sure why i always have issues using those selectors
[03:33:34] <coldhead> with a function that returns true or false if it has the value you want
[03:37:58] <kurisu> hmmm... console.log($('#pml_media_list li').eq(0).attr('id')); = undefined
[03:38:54] <kurisu> <ul class="gallery" id="pml_media_list">
[03:39:44] <Nickname_> Hi
[03:40:31] <kurisu> why would an element that is there be returned as undefined??
[03:42:26] <muzone> kurisu: dont ask too many questions
[03:42:28] <muzone> or you will pay: http://jeremiahjaer.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/tumblr_l4pib0q90u1qzfm5xo1_500.jpg
[03:43:46] <kurisu> whats the point of irc if not to ask for help??
[03:44:11] <kurisu> I've tried google but don't know what to searh for
[03:59:06] <sunscreen> http://stream.selectukradio.tk/shoutstats-0.8.4/gauges/gt2.php <-- the gauge does not go up to the first value and its smooth but seems to be a little jumpy jumpy
[04:01:20] <Renex> does anyone know why $('#bg_color option').hover(function(){});  or $('#bg_color option').live('hover', function(){}); doesn't work in Chrome? it works as it should in firefox...
[04:02:04] <nail_> I'm not sure to understand why $('<div>').attr('id') returns an empty string and not undefined, unlike $('<div>').attr('foo') with jQuery < 1.6. Is this because "id" is a property and not an attribute?
[04:02:23] <walid> hi guys!
[04:02:47] <walid> i'm trying to make a background image wait until it's fully loaded before it is displayed.
[04:03:09] <rocksprout> How to change the "action" value of a form, before using $(form).submit()?   I don't want to use ajax, I just want to submit the form to a different location...
[04:03:12] <John33> How could I modifie this code "http://pastebin.com/LndeGvMn" so that it sais the value from start before you enter one and so that the value gets updated when you reset the textarea?
[04:03:47] <geekbuntu> walid, http://engineeredweb.com/blog/09/12/preloading-images-jquery-and-javascript
[04:04:26] <walid> geekbuntu: i read tens of these, but i still have 2 issues
[04:04:42] <walid> in this particular case, it's the body's bckgd image that needs to be loaded
[04:05:11] <walid> so.. i kind of need to have the body wait for the image to be loaded before it is displayed, or smth...
[04:05:16] <geekbuntu> walid, and it cannot be preloaded?
[04:05:53] <walid> otherwise i could maybe change the background-value once the img is loaded?
[04:06:03] <aaairc> what would give me a smoother transition? CSS transition or jquery.animate()... i'm going to be sliding in a container with a a big image in it...
[04:06:21] <walid> geekbuntu: well, loaded before what exactly? i'm not sure i understand when the scripts are loaded...
[04:06:48] <aaairc> right now i'm doing it with CSS transition but its pretty jumpy
[04:07:40] <geekbuntu> walid, anything preloaded, means the browser has it cached.
[04:07:53] <geekbuntu> (before rendering)
[04:08:11] <walid> geekbuntu: so i need to preload my image before the body is even loaded, hehe
[04:08:43] <geekbuntu> embed it in document.ready()
[04:09:41] <John33> geekbuntu: Any chance you could help me out with my q? :)
[04:10:11] <geekbuntu> depends on level of difficulty - i'm new to jquery
[04:10:18] <geekbuntu> but i can use google
[04:10:23] <John33> Its like square 1 :D
[04:10:39] <John33> How could I modifie this code "http://pastebin.com/LndeGvMn" so that it sais the value from start before you enter one and so that the value gets updated when you reset the textarea?
[04:11:00] <walid> geekbuntu: i added a img.src="url_to_my_img", but it doesn't help :(
[04:11:33] <geekbuntu> walid, calm down 'img' is the dom tag - do not add it to anything else
[04:11:50] <walid> lol
[04:11:56] <walid> that's true ;)
[04:12:09] <John33> When I type text into the textfield it counts the letters and gives me a number. But the number doesent get reseted when I press the reset button. How can I reset the number together with the reset button?
[04:12:49] <geekbuntu> John33, it helps a lot if you paste this in fiddle i'll do it and see if i can  see why not resetting
[04:13:05] <John33> Ok I'll do that.
[04:13:39] <kurisu> ok.... back to basics.... I have a ul called #pml_list how would I get the id of the first li
[04:14:01] <maxmac> Are there events for page reload (F5) and back buttons in jquery or javascript?
[04:14:08] <kurisu> tried google but can't get any results to work
[04:15:08] <geekbuntu> John33, try to bind a click to a button or link that executes $('#charCounterInputField').empty();
[04:15:12] <geekbuntu> should reset your counter
[04:15:20] <geekbuntu> right now you have nothing that addresses the reset
[04:15:35] <kurisu> so far ive tried $('#pml_media_list').eq(0).attr('id') and $('#pml_media_list').get(0).attr('id') but I cnat get either to work
[04:16:54] <geekbuntu> maxmac,  location.reload();
[04:17:00] <Cork> kurisu: you don't need to use .eq or .get on an id
[04:17:13] <Cork> kurisu: they will always only return one result
[04:17:30] <Cork> so $('#pml_media_list').eq(0).attr('id') is the same as $('#pml_media_list').attr('id')
[04:17:45] <walid> i get a 404 not found error, even though the link is working
[04:18:49] <Cork> kurisu: but if the id is the ul you should use $('#pml_media_list li').eq(0).attr('id')
[04:18:49] <geekbuntu> walid, use jsfiddle - even if i don't have the answer it will help somebody else
[04:19:15] <walid> geekbuntu: true. sry i'm a bit in a rush got a meeting in 40 minutes, that's why ^^
[04:20:38] <geekbuntu> walid, sounds like you're wrestling with a coding concepts - which is bad to do when rushing
[04:21:26] <walid> geekbuntu: unfortunately that is true
[04:23:38] <Kim^J> Yo!
[04:24:42] <Kim^J> I have an AJAX-request in which I make several other AJAX-request, is it possible to wait until the child-requests are done before doing something? (In this case showing the result.)
[04:27:21] <John33> geekbuntu: http://jsfiddle.net/rPpAf/
[04:27:24] <John33> =)
[04:28:42] <maxmac> geekbuntu i meant the other way around , like
[04:29:04] <maxmac> $(window).reload(function () {});
[04:29:18] <maxmac> or is that what you meant?
[04:29:32] <blackspotwiggins> maxmac, not quite, there is onbeforeunload that fires before you leave the page
[04:29:50] <maxmac> hmmmm, thats no good
[04:30:12] <maxmac> i use checkboxes for filtering with ajax, and on a reload the ajax is defaultet, but the checkboxes are still checked
[04:30:38] <bjhaid> hi, please what is wrong with this line of code, it wouldnt run var h = $("<div>").html("b").css({"font-size":"200%"});
[04:30:52] <maxmac> Kim^J do the other ajax requests in the success method?
[04:31:06] <blackspotwiggins> maxmac, if you reload with f5 then all the form values are retained
[04:31:19] <maxmac> yes, also when i use the back button
[04:31:47] <maxmac> is there a way to submit the ajax request again on reload and back, without using bbq?
[04:31:48] <geekbuntu> maxmac,           $('#Button1').click(function() {
[04:31:48] <geekbuntu>                 location.reload();
[04:31:48] <geekbuntu>             });
[04:32:08] <Kim^J> maxmac: I am, I want the parent request to do something when the child requests are done.
[04:32:32] <maxmac> geekbuntu i dont want to init a reload, i want to check if one has been done
[04:32:46] <blackspotwiggins> maxmac, aside from regular window.onload i cant think of anything
[04:32:49] <Kim^J> maxmac: Load parent request -> For each in result do child request -> When all child requests are done, display result
[04:32:55] <blackspotwiggins> but you cant really make sure if it's a new load or not
[04:33:15] <blackspotwiggins> Kim^J, there is ajaxStop global event that triggers when all requests are done
[04:33:21] <bjhaid> please can anyone tell me what is wrong with this line of code:
[04:33:21] <bjhaid>  var h = $("<div>").html(b).css({"font-size":"200%"})
[04:33:42] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, nothing really
[04:33:48] <maxmac> it dosent matter really. So you think load will trigger on page reload and back?
[04:33:52] <Kim^J> blackspotwiggins: There are other AJAX-request running, which I can't affect.
[04:34:03] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: it wouldnt compile
[04:34:13] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, im sorry wat?
[04:34:28] <bjhaid> blacksportwiggins: it wouldnt run i mean, and firebug is getting no errors
[04:34:29] <blackspotwiggins> maxmac, it triggers when the reload is done
[04:34:40] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, it runs for sure
[04:34:53] <blackspotwiggins> probably you are not doing anything with the snippet
[04:34:56] <John33> Could someone please help me with this one? http://jsfiddle.net/rPpAf/
[04:34:58] <blackspotwiggins> like injecting into dom
[04:35:12] <John33> How can I reset the counter when I press the reset button?
[04:35:41] <blackspotwiggins> Kim^J, did you read what i said?
[04:35:46] <blackspotwiggins> Kim^J, http://www.jqapi.com/#p=ajaxStop
[04:35:50] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: I am including it in this code $("<div>").html("Incoming call from: " + "<br><br>" + h + "<br>" + a).dialog
[04:36:11] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, you are still not injecting it tho
[04:36:25] <blackspotwiggins> and you cant just add jquery objects as strings in html
[04:36:33] <maxmac> blackspotwiggins ok thats great. Is there a way to make it run on load, but not on fresh page?
[04:36:34] <Kim^J> blackspotwiggins: Yes, but there are other AJAX request running that aren't mine.
[04:36:44] <blackspotwiggins> maxmac, not really
[04:36:47] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: what should i do to get it work?
[04:37:16] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: should i convert h to text before i add it to html?
[04:37:40] <maxmac> hmm, on load ill check if any filtering options are checked, if so ill reload with ajax. should work no?
[04:37:47] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, you could, but that's a retarded way to do this
[04:38:08] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: so what's the right way, i am really new to jquery
[04:38:18] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, try adding .appendTo(document.body) before calling dailog
[04:38:30] <blackspotwiggins> you are creating markup, but its not added to the page
[04:38:36] <blackspotwiggins> i suggest reading up on wtf you are doing
[04:38:59] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: thanks
[04:40:51] <blackspotwiggins> maxmac, i dont really understand what you are trying to do
[04:41:11] <blackspotwiggins> but i'd just not use checkbox state for control
[04:42:21] <ruby_on_tails> http://jsfiddle.net/4VQzR/ hi why doesnt the second click give same output like the first click ?
[04:42:26] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins:      var h = $("<div>").html("b").css({"font-size":"200%"});
[04:42:26] <bjhaid>       var l = h.appendTo(document.body);
[04:42:26] <bjhaid>       alert(l); this did not work
[04:45:35] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, http://jsfiddle.net/DTkfp/
[04:45:38] <kurisu> Cork: thanks.. was afc... when I use $('#pml_media_list li').eq(0).attr('id') I get 'undefined'
[04:45:39] <blackspotwiggins> you are doing it wrong then
[04:46:17] <enotodden> John33 $(".button").click(function(){$("#charCounter").html("");});
[04:47:30] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: in my code, i am picking string from a json response, and inserting it in a dialog, i want to increase the font of one of the elements in the dialog, i am not appending to the body, please do clarify  me on this, i just seem a little confused
[04:48:34] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, the thing is
[04:48:38] <blackspotwiggins> you are not adding it
[04:48:39] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: in my code, i am picking string from a json response, and inserting it in a dialog, i want to increase the font of one of the elements in the dialog, i am not appending to the body, please do clarify  me on this, i just seem a little confused
[04:48:47] <blackspotwiggins> what you should do is
[04:48:51] <blackspotwiggins> take the response
[04:48:54] <kurisu> Cork: and if I use  $('#pml_media_list li').attr('id') then I also get undefined but if I use 	console.log("logging ('#pml_media_list li').eq(0).attr('id'))");
[04:48:55] <blackspotwiggins> add it to some container
[04:49:45] <bjhaid> blackspotwigggins:  i cant tamper with the DOM, all i want to do it to prepare a js and send it to be injected, so a dialog pops up when a json is received
[04:50:08] <kurisu> ***** but if I use $('#pml_media_list').attr('id') then I get 'pml_media_list'
[04:50:18] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: that works fine, but i need to format the font in the dialog
[04:50:30] <blackspotwiggins> then find the element using .find()
[04:50:33] <blackspotwiggins> and set css then
[04:50:56] <blackspotwiggins> and then call dialog
[04:51:06] <maxmac> how much data can i save in a cookie? Can i save a whole page?
[04:51:34] <soee> ji, how cah i do such thing (might be plugin) i have navigation with 4 links, when i click one of them related contetn should slide in from the right side of defined container?
[04:51:43] <John33> enotodden: Big thanks!
[04:51:47] <Paganini> Hello, I'm cycling through paragraphs using .each and appending the text to a string, but I want to ignore any <spans> inside of the a paragraph if it has one, without hiding the spans can I do this?
[04:52:06] <blackspotwiggins> maxmac, you are on a downward spiral of bad practices.
[04:53:27] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: so say the json string is "b" i do var a = "b".find().css({"font-size":"200%"});
[04:53:33] <blackspotwiggins> no
[04:53:42] <blackspotwiggins> ffs
[04:54:03] <John33> enotodden: How can I do so that it always sais 0 characters when you load page and when you press reset button? Because now it only shows up when you type...
[04:54:04] <maxmac> blackspotwiggins true that. what would you recommend if one wants to cache ajax requests? Is it doable?
[04:54:13] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: ffs?
[04:54:55] <blackspotwiggins> maxmac, do nothing, if server responds with 304
[04:55:01] <blackspotwiggins> its taken from cache
[04:55:44] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, you need to 1) inject the response to dom 2) find elements you want to make larger and do that 3) call dialog
[04:55:47] <blackspotwiggins> or
[04:55:48] <blackspotwiggins> better yet
[04:56:02] <blackspotwiggins> use classes in response
[04:56:07] <blackspotwiggins> and css to style things
[04:56:11] <blackspotwiggins> like normal webdevelopers do
[04:57:03] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: i basically cant edit the DOM so basically what you are suggesting is i include a class in the json from my backend, and style it?
[04:57:18] <blackspotwiggins> what the fuck do you mean you cant edit dom
[04:58:21] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: i have limited control over the html, i have been instructed to produce a js that pops-up, so i am testing it from backend, the clients are meant to listen to messages and pop-up when a message is sent, so the js should work in any html
[04:59:37] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: it should work with the end-user not having to create div tags and the likes
[05:00:29] <blackspotwiggins> ?gl @ bjhaid
[05:00:30] <bot-t> bjhaid, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[05:00:47] <blackspotwiggins> oh that site is down
[05:00:52] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: thanks alot
[05:00:58] <bjhaid> i do appreciate your efforst
[05:01:02] <bjhaid> efforts
[05:01:17] <blackspotwiggins> you are asking how to manipulate the page without manipulating it
[05:01:20] <blackspotwiggins> its impossimble
[05:02:03] <Paganini> I'm trying to remove a span tag within a paragraph while looping through the paragraphs and not hiding the tag, can somebody take a look please? http://jsfiddle.net/nwXUd/1/
[05:02:22] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: well i have been popin dialogs by just passing the js in the head of the html, and it worked
[05:03:09] <blackspotwiggins> if you can do dialogs (with exception of confirm() and friends) with out touching html, you deserve a medal
[05:03:29] <blackspotwiggins> i suggest you learn web development basics before claiming impossible things
[05:03:47] <bjhaid> i would post my codes and you have a look

[05:05:25] <sadmicrowave> hi
[05:05:30] <sadmicrowave> yea I see it
[05:07:36] <sadmicrowave> bot-t, tell nascro I figured out what was causing the states coordinates error in FF. some of the coordinate strings were malformed and were missing commas in specific places.  As far as I can see FF3.6 was the only browser that didn't ignore the syntax error and keep going
[05:07:36] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, Okay.
[05:08:11] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: have you looked @ it
[05:08:26] <blackspotwiggins> bjhaid, no
[05:08:34] <blackspotwiggins> you are too stubborn
[05:08:39] <blackspotwiggins> ive told you everything you need already
[05:08:53] <blackspotwiggins> if you dont want to use that, its your personal tragedy
[05:09:16] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: i am not stubborn, i have thought of it same way, but i am limited, and was wondering if you had a look @ my codes you could have ideas
[05:09:31] <bjhaid> blackspotwiggins: to help me out with
[05:14:06] <austinbv> bjhaid: you are not too limited to use an append before or after
[05:14:39] <bjhaid> austinbv: how do i achieve it that, dont understand you
[05:14:47] <austinbv> you need to read the docs http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
[05:14:58] <austinbv> blackspotwiggins: really has told you everything you need to know
[05:15:44] <Sean-Der> I am confused my code works in every browser, but in IE it refuse to do ANYTHING. Like my DOM start isn't even working :(
[05:15:44] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/K6sxrBSn
[05:15:56] <Sean-Der> I read something about bubbleing?
[05:16:44] <bjhaid> austinbv: you mean i can achieve the samething without creating div tags in the html right?
[05:17:59] <austinbv> $("<div>") creates an element but does not put it anywhere
[05:18:10] <austinbv> you never put the element anywhere
[05:18:32] <austinbv> you need to do that there is nothing else I can do to help you
[05:18:35] <austinbv> read the docs
[05:18:43] <Sean-Der> Is my read function not correct maybe?
[05:19:21] <austinbv> why are you using delegate?
[05:19:40] <austinbv> oh never mind
[05:19:52] <bjhaid> austinbv: thanks alot
[05:19:58] <bjhaid> i remain grateful
[05:21:28] <philosophically> i have a horizontally scrolling div that i would like to control with arrows outside the div, i am going nuts trying to figure this out... anyone know of an awesome way for jquery to control the scrollbars of the divs, maybe even have is so that if you mouse over the arrow it will scroll the div until it reaches the end.. ?
[05:22:25] <austinbv> philosophically: try looking at scroll to methods
[05:24:20] <philosophically> austinbv: so this may be a noob question but, for example the .scroll(), i get that it can tell me when i'm scrolling the div but how does it control the scrolling?
[05:26:07] <austinbv> no look at some plugins scrollTo is a good one
[05:26:25] <austinbv> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[05:26:47] <Sean-Der> Does anyone know somewhere to ask that be able to help me?

[05:28:40] <kaista> Hi anyone have any experience with jquery ui autocomplete and .net web services? if i use standard $.ajax it works and returns json but if i set the autocomplete source to the webservice it fails... the requested content type is correct as ive checked the headers etc..
[05:28:50] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, what does it do/not do in IE9?
[05:28:52] <ravenzz> i hate static paste
[05:28:56] <Sean-Der> The DOM is starting I put an alert at the top and it responded. But I don't know any trouble shooting beyond that
[05:29:23] <Sean-Der> Starting with the comment //Gets the first phone
[05:29:32] <Sean-Der> Does nothing on a button press!
[05:30:09] <ravenzz> Sean-Der try to remove the comment
[05:30:39] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, you put an alert within the .click() and it worked?
[05:31:01] <ravenzz> which error you got?
[05:31:06] <austinbv> kaista: fails is not very descriptive
[05:31:18] <kaista> austinbv it returns xml instead of json
[05:31:22] <Sean-Der> No I just put an alert directly following the DOM start, this worked suggesting that the .js is being called correctly. Testing click right now
[05:31:29] <Sean-Der> Also running without comments still doesn't work
[05:31:37] <austinbv> then your .net app is not serving json
[05:31:47] <kaista> austinbv, if i do a $.ajax call it returns json lovely, however if i use autocomplete's source = ws.asmx/helloworld it returns xml
[05:31:59] <ravenzz> Sean-Der can you provide a ?live example?
[05:32:01] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, when putting the alert() within the .click() make sure to place it before the .load() event
[05:32:10] <kaista> austinbv, no it is but only when i use $.ajax if i use autocomplete it returns xml

[05:32:28] <Sean-Der> Hmmm the button do work...
[05:32:32] <Sean-Der> Its my .load()
[05:32:53] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, is productgets.php a real page?
[05:32:57] <austinbv> what do the docs mean on ?trigger when it says it bubbles the dom?

[05:33:24] <kaista> excuse the vb, customer requirement
[05:33:28] <Sean-Der> Yes productgets exists
[05:33:34] <austinbv> and your auto complete code?
[05:33:40] <Sean-Der> Am I using .load() incorrectly?
[05:33:49] <ravenzz> Sean-Der can you provide us a live example?

[05:35:18] <sadmicrowave> oops
[05:35:21] <ravenzz> yes or on the same server where productgets.php is hosted
[05:35:25] <ravenzz> it could be better
[05:35:36] <Sean-Der> I though .live() was replaced by delegate?

[05:36:22] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, I didn't mean to do .live() I was trying to get bot-t to tell you about a demo
[05:37:10] <ximarin> hi all, i have a standard .tabs() thats using the whole screen. Within one of the tabs, the table is much wider than the tab, but the tab does not expand to the right. table-lauout is fixed, widths of the cell is set to a specific width. What am I doing wrong? :)
[05:37:43] <sadmicrowave> fantomas, what css property is backgroundPosition?
[05:38:02] <fantomas> sadmicrowave: background-position
[05:38:13] <sadmicrowave> oh
[05:38:35] <fantomas> sadmicrowave: I want to change it too when the admin panel (drupal module) change body's margin-left
[05:38:39] <sadmicrowave> fantomas, just chain your css together like so $('element').css('left','100px', 'background-position','[new-value]');
[05:39:24] <kaista> austinbv tried setting dataType and contentType inside the autocomplete options still returns text/xml
[05:39:33] <kaista> (seperately)
[05:39:37] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, did you figure it out?
[05:39:47] <austinbv> take a look here kaista http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1592048/jquery-autocomplete-with-json-response
[05:39:48] <Sean-Der> No I am working on getting a demo up sorry!
[05:39:56] <sadmicrowave> it's ok
[05:40:20] <fantomas> sadmicrowave: unfort. its not good idea to patch stock module's js, so I'm looking for a client-side way
[05:40:45] <fantomas> sadmicrowave: just interested - does jQuery spread some even when css is changed
[05:41:26] <sadmicrowave> fantomas, I don't understand the question ('does jQuery spread some')
[05:41:31] <fantomas> sorry
[05:42:11] <fantomas> sadmicrowave: does jQuery triggers some event which I can bind to
[05:42:29] <fantomas> when some css property is changed
[05:42:45] <Sean-Der> http://portal.vtgus.com/orderform.php
[05:42:51] <Sean-Der> Works great in FireFox
[05:42:59] <Sean-Der> nothing in IE
[05:43:08] <sadmicrowave> fantomas, I don't think so...but I still fail to see why you can't just chain the events together...why bind on another event
[05:43:27] <fantomas> sadmicrowave: it is module which I can't patch
[05:43:42] <sadmicrowave> fantomas, what is a module?
[05:43:49] <fantomas> sadmicrowave: something, not mine.
[05:43:59] <sadmicrowave> gotcha!
[05:43:59] <fantomas> admin panel, a Drupal module
[05:44:22] <fantomas> well, then I'll find a way to replace this js with my version on the fly
[05:44:30] <fantomas> thanks

[05:48:00] <austinbv> ah this bot needs to start likeing me
[05:48:21] <austinbv> philosophically: look at the hover method
[05:48:30] <philosophically> austinbv: ok, thank you :)
[05:48:50] <austinbv> whats the bot syntax for linking jq methods?
[05:48:57] <kaista> austinbv, i have tried that.. the parse function will only work if its json anyway but the return type (in the headers and the content) is xml still very strange..
[05:49:16] <kaista> the parse function is great as i can use it to get data.d (security feature of .net) but still its returning xml :S
[05:49:17] <kaista> :(
[05:49:30] <austinbv> I am not a .net expert but it sounds like your application is serving the wrong code
[05:49:38] <austinbv> and it's not a jquery function
[05:49:42] <austinbv> er problem
[05:50:08] <austinbv> philosophically: you could probably use css for that which is faster than jq
[05:50:18] <kaista> austinbv, its strange as the .ajax call works so im thinking i need to send extra info via the autocomplete
[05:50:22] <austinbv> if you are just trying to grow and shrink a code block
[05:50:35] <austinbv> same get url?
[05:51:27] <atriv> im having an issue where my function is returning valid json but the callback will only execute if the json is very simple. does jquery kill the ajax call if it takes too long?
[05:51:29] <sadmicrowave> austinbv, whats your question about bot syntax?
[05:51:32] <austinbv> kaista: can I see your ajax call
[05:51:44] <austinbv> sadmicrowave: how do you have it link a jq method
[05:51:54] <Sean-Der> Ok so passing variables to my PHP scripts such as ?dropdown=1 is what seems to be killing it!

[05:51:57] <educr0w> Hello, I have a item list generated by php, the list consists on ItemName - Add to cart link - Remove from cart link. Now I have an onclick function like addToCart(itemID) and removeFromCart(itemID) (http://www.movius.com.ar/work/cart), is possible to attach a generic click event to both links? that works like the function
[05:52:00] <Cork> atriv: no, the complexity shouldn't matter
[05:52:04] <sadmicrowave> austinbv, is that what you mean?
[05:52:04] <austinbv> sadmicrowave: thanks
[05:52:08] <philosophically> austinbv: well i just want to loop the same code for only when mouseover happens... not sure how to handle the loop though... i have a div that is scrolling when you mouseover the arrows that control it but only scrolls a set amount of pixels and stops
[05:52:14] <Cork> atriv: have you tested the json in jsonlint?
[05:52:25] <sadmicrowave> austinbv see .live
[05:52:30] <atriv> Cork: I haven't ill check it out
[05:52:32] <sadmicrowave> hmm...I thought that worked too
[05:52:47] <Sean-Der> Is that improper to pass variables in a URL?

[05:54:06] <atriv> Cork: thanks... I didn't know you couldn't pass back NaN values
[05:54:13] <atriv> i figured they'd just be assumed as "Null"
[05:54:43] <austinbv> Paganini: set visible to none or set display to none
[05:54:45] <Cork> atriv: json is a really simple format :)
[05:54:56] <nail_> philosophically: the idea is to use setTimeout so you are not stuck in a loop that will lock your process
[05:55:01] <ocp> hello guys, how would i execute a php url from a link using jquery ? , what i want to do is, click on a button and execute a php script url ?
[05:55:17] <philosophically> nail_:  this is perfect, thank you!
[05:55:22] <atriv> Cork: thats why i like it! good to know about json lint

[05:56:48] <Paganini> austinbv I don't want to remove it from the page
[05:57:05] <ocp> austinbv, sorry im pretty new to this, is there a demo ? a complete version im not sure how to put it all together
[05:57:05] <PhanLord> anyway to select jqueryUI dialog button elements (in order to disable/enable the same ? )
[05:57:15] <Paganini> austinbv as I'm reading the html, however I could hide it then show it again after the paragraphs have been ready... might be a good idea
[05:57:19] <Paganini> austinbv bit unorthodox though
[05:57:37] <Paganini> but good clue :D
[05:57:51] <austinbv> ? g jquery ajax @ ocp
[05:57:51] <bot-t> ocp, jQuery.ajax()  jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:57:58] <pickels> Is there an element created event? I have some other javascript code adding an element and I would like to alter it with jQuery.
[05:58:13] <austinbv> the docs have demos of it working
[05:58:16] <austinbv> ocp
[05:58:21] <ocp> austinbv yes im there http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:58:30] <ocp> but im not sure what to do :(
[05:58:34] <ocp> there are many codes
[05:58:35] <austinbv> sorry I am just trying to get the bot to work for me not trying to be a dick :)
[05:58:37] <Sean-Der> Maybe I am correct I think jQuery.post is a more correct fn for my needs?
[05:58:46] <austinbv> yes all those codes are what you need
[05:59:48] <Paganini> austinbv: so you can't omit an element from say $(this).html().remove('<span>');?
[06:00:04] <Paganini> if you're setting that to a var
[06:00:25] <austinbv> well remove removes it from the dom
[06:00:30] <austinbv> is that want you want?
[06:00:33] <austinbv> Paganini:
[06:00:42] <Paganini> no, just from the actual text which is being stored in a var
[06:00:48] <Paganini> well from the html()
[06:01:00] <Paganini> I want the dom to remain in tact
[06:01:03] <austinbv> Paganini: I am not sure I understand
[06:01:29] <Paganini> well I basically was going to parse the .html() from a <p> through regex to remove any <span>something</span> inside of it
[06:01:37] <Paganini> but apparently regex and html is a BAD idea
[06:01:52] <Paganini> so I wanted to remove the span it using jquery, but NOT from the page
[06:02:27] <Paganini> I'm taking the html from an element and putting it somewhere else
[06:04:17] <kaista> austinbv, its down to the autocomplete uses GET instead of POST.. just trying to set type: "GET" now
[06:04:27] <kaista> god damn internet connection is failing so hard
[06:04:36] <austinbv> first Paganini PLEASE for the love of god don't pares html with regex second what do you mean remove you just want the span to not have any style?
[06:04:57] <Paganini> austinbv: exactly with the html, hence why I'm asking here :)
[06:04:58] <austinbv> so it is your routes
[06:04:59] <kaista> austinbv any idea how i can set an autocomplete to use POST instead of GET? im trying type: "POST"
[06:05:15] <austinbv> what do you mean remove Paganini I still don't understand
[06:05:30] <Paganini> austinbv: I don't want to remove it from the DOM, no hidden, no hide, it stays on the page, but I want the a variable to have the .html() value of the elment MINUS any spans inside of it
[06:05:36] <austinbv> kaista: that's how
[06:06:00] <austinbv> but you shouldnt mess with your REST like that you should instead write your application to server a get request for json
[06:06:13] <Paganini> austinbv: not sure how I can make it any simpler :/
[06:06:16] <austinbv> since you are not POSTing data
[06:06:57] <austinbv> you want to have a var with everything inside <p> tags excluding any span tags?
[06:07:05] <Paganini> yeah :)
[06:07:24] <austinbv> so <p>hello <span>world</span></p> would become <p>hello world</p>
[06:07:29] <Paganini> exactly
[06:08:04] <Paganini> but 'world' is not static
[06:08:15] <Paganini> it could change on any page
[06:12:31] <delinquentme> hey does anyone happen to know if there is an autodry utility for jquery / JS?
[06:13:19] <PhanLord> is there a way to disable close button on jqueryUI dialog ? (doing button('disable') on it doesnt disable it
[06:14:11] <nail_> Paganini: I didn't read the whole thing, but isn't .text() what you want?
[06:14:29] <austinbv> ?text @ Paganini
[06:14:29] <bot-t> Paganini, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[06:14:50] <Paganini> erm
[06:14:53] <austinbv> Paganini: http://jsfiddle.net/
[06:14:59] <Paganini> that sounds like you're getting text from all elements
[06:15:13] <Paganini> I want to remove an element and the text hang on looks like austinbv's on the case :D
[06:15:15] <austinbv> i have a working example on jsfiddle
[06:15:24] <austinbv> if my internet would save it
[06:15:33] <Paganini> think jsfiddle is having a bad time
[06:15:38] <Paganini> timing out on me
[06:15:45] <austinbv> me too
[06:15:53] <Paganini> give it a cake :(
[06:16:19] <kborchers> PhanLord: you could try $("a.ui-dialog-titlebar-close").unbind("click");
[06:16:38] <kborchers> it won't "look" disabled though
[06:17:00] <austinbv> 1 sec I can gist the whole thing https://gist.github.com/1120158
[06:17:18] <austinbv> oh requst went through Paganini http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/9w2B5/
[06:17:28] <PhanLord> hmm that sucks :) i have to store old click somewhere so i can ebaled it again :(
[06:17:59] <PhanLord> ill just add an option/flag and handle non closing on beforeClose
[06:18:06] <Paganini> it's still loading... zzzz :D
[06:18:30] <kborchers> yeah, that should work
[06:19:20] <kborchers> PhanLord: you could always just rebind the click event to do a .dialog("close") on the dialog in question as well
[06:20:02] <educr0w> Hello, I have a item list generated by php, the list consists on ItemName - Add to cart link - Remove from cart link. Now I have an onclick function like addToCart(itemID) and removeFromCart(itemID) (http://www.movius.com.ar/work/cart), is possible to attach a generic click event to both links? that works like the function
[06:20:04] <Paganini> aunstinbv apologies but I wish for 'bar' to be left out too, the span tags with the value too
[06:20:33] <Paganini> so the whole of "<span>foodbar</span>"
[06:20:48] <Paganini> foodbar...
[06:20:58] * Woet hands Paganini a food bar
[06:21:09] <Paganini> nom nom
[06:21:59] <austinbv> so you dont want <p>foo<span>bar</span></p> to be <p>foobar</p>
[06:22:15] <Paganini> <p>foo</p>
[06:22:30] <Paganini> would be the end result
[06:23:22] <Paganini> hang on, from your example I could use x in .replace(x, '');
[06:23:24] <Paganini> that should work?
[06:26:52] <seutje> when throwing an exception because a certain DOM element is missing, should I be using a ReferenceError, a DOMException or a regular exception, the absence of this element would render it worthless...
[06:31:25] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, i'd go for referenceerror, if any

[06:37:11] <Sean-Der> I have made some progress it seems Internet Explorer doesn't like .load() very much
[06:37:23] <Sean-Der> Now I have the variable what is the best way to work with it?
[06:37:43] <Sean-Der> .load() took an entire div is there another function that can do the same?
[06:37:53] <Sean-Der> Append would work but....
[06:41:53] <Sean-Der> Anyone have any experince with the issue I am having?
[06:43:48] <sbahra> Does anybody here have familiarity with flot? Is there an easy to have the key/legend be displayed outside of the graph?
[06:44:16] <Sean-Der> http://pastebin.com/3JVXQ8Br
[06:44:31] <Sean-Der> If I do an alert on (data) it works wonderfully
[06:46:50] <Sean-Der> Got it! Thanks for the help earlier on guys. What really helped me is IE9 and its developer tools maybe that will help anyone lurking

[06:50:35] <sadmicrowave> nascro, hey dude!
[06:50:50] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Yo!
[06:50:51] <bot-t> (1 hour 43 mins ago) <sadmicrowave> tell nascro I figured out what was causing the states coordinates error in FF. some of the coordinate strings were malformed and were missing commas in specific places. As far as I can see FF3.6 was the only browser that didn't ignore the syntax error and keep going
[06:51:09] <sadmicrowave> :)
[06:51:37] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Oh wow, missing commas? Easy fix
[06:51:43] <sadmicrowave> indeed
[06:52:04] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Do you remember the states?
[06:52:06] <sadmicrowave> new mexico, california, and montana
[06:52:15] <sadmicrowave> actually, here:
[06:52:46] <sadmicrowave> well, hold on, jsfiddle is acting up right now
[06:53:20] <sadmicrowave> nascro, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/EXyhm/7/
[06:54:05] <sadmicrowave> ^notice the groupBy:'title' option, this enables you to hover over 1 of the hawaiian islands and all get hilighted
[06:54:21] <sadmicrowave> nascro, similarly for New York
[06:54:50] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: YES! I was just running into that problem. Each area needs the same id="hawaii_modal" and I wasn't sure how to approach that problem.
[06:55:01] <sadmicrowave> :)
[06:55:11] <sadmicrowave> and also notice I got abunch more states done
[06:55:25] <sadmicrowave> I'm finishing up West Virginia now
[06:55:38] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Actually, I'm not sure that solves it...
[06:55:58] <sadmicrowave> solves the data-modal problem?
[06:56:09] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: WV is nasty.
[06:56:29] <sadmicrowave> yea, I just mapped the coordinates, I just need to enter them in now
[06:56:39] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: mapped by hand?
[06:57:06] <sadmicrowave> I was looking into GIMP for trying to make an array of plotted coordinates, then just copy and paste into the fiddle...but I couldn't figure it out...so yes, by hand
[06:57:15] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Yeah, when I hover over any one of the Hawaiian Islands, I need the same div id to be displayed using the modal plugin I have
[06:58:01] <sadmicrowave> nascro, I don't see that being an issue, just add that model id to all the hawaii area tags
[06:58:12] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Yeah, wasn't sure how any image editor could get/follow the coordinates of a line, for example. Especially since the stroke intersects with others states.
[06:58:35] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: if I have the same id="" on multiple divs, the document is not well-formed
[06:58:40] <sadmicrowave> yea, I kinda abandoned that idea
[06:59:32] <sadmicrowave> well, I don't think the doc will fail, all the it will do is override the other duplicate div id's...but in this case that is what you want...
[06:59:58] <sadmicrowave> alternatively, do they HAVE to be id's?
[07:01:11] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: I'm using this plugin called "Reveal" by ZURB
[07:01:37] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: Honestly, I don't have the jQuery knowledge I need to modify the plugin.
[07:02:05] <sphinxxx> to save DOM calls, does it matter if you do var blah = $('#blah');   or var $blah = $('#blah');
[07:02:07] <sadmicrowave> nascro, off topic question...do you have another image of USA with all the states colored #cccccc?
[07:02:19] <Haon99> I'm loading an image with an ajax call. I want to check the width/height of the image which is sitting raw in the 'request' variable. How would I do this?
[07:02:33] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: no, but I could open Illustrator and do it if needed.
[07:02:56] <Haon99> Something like make a new Image() and set the .data attribute to request?
[07:02:58] <sadmicrowave> sphinxxx, no, naming your variables is personal preference
[07:03:38] <sadmicrowave> sphinxxx, it is a good identifier to differentiate between variables holding elements and variables holding strings or other values though
[07:04:45] <sadmicrowave> nascro, yea, I'm not sure how you go about doing it, but the only way for me to do it is get a paint brush and carefully color in each remaining state....tedious and stupid if you have an easier way
[07:05:15] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: I am attempting to send you a file using this IRC client
[07:06:23] <sadmicrowave> nascro, I have file receipt turned off...can you just post it somewhere. or give me the path to it on your server like your other files
[07:06:26] <sadmicrowave> brb
[07:09:33] <Paganini> sorry to bother you guys again! I've got my method of how I want store the paragraphs html minus any spans, however I can't 'quite' finish it, http://jsfiddle.net/9w2B5/3/ the span.something is incorrect I'm sure, is there any way to get the whole element AND it's contents?
[07:09:59] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: LMK when you're back.
[07:10:35] <opie_> Paganini:  what do you want to get?
[07:10:58] <Paganini> from <p>foo<span>bar</span></p> just 'foo'
[07:12:25] <Paganini> but to do that I want to get <span>bar</span> and then do a replace(string, ''); on the whole thing
[07:13:48] <nail_> Paganini: http://jsfiddle.net/9w2B5/4/
[07:14:45] <Paganini> ahaaaa, clone... :D you ROX I thought I could use remove but I didn't clone it first and didn't want to touch the dom
[07:14:53] <Paganini> Nail: thank yoooou :)
[07:14:56] <nail_> welcome :)
[07:15:02] <kborchers> Paganini: haven't tried it but what about var elem = $("p").clone(); elem.children().remove(); var text = elem.text();
[07:15:06] <Paganini> I was kinda... not really that close, how good is that :P
[07:15:07] <kborchers> ha i was just writing that
[07:15:40] <Paganini> haha, this problems been driving me nuts, I can't believe there's no way using something like $('span'); by itself to get the whole thing :/
[07:16:39] <newman> Hi people. I've got a div with a table in it. Trying to make the table sort of draggable using mousedown+mousemove events on the div, and setting scrollLeft and scrollTop accordingly. But after dragging a few short times a lot of text in the table is selected, and acts like a huge "lump" when I try to drag the next time. Is it possible to somehow disable text selection?
[07:17:05] <opie_> newman: are you using the jquery ui draggable?
[07:18:06] <nascro> @sadmicrowave I was wrong. I don't need multiple ids, just multiple custom attributes
[07:18:37] <nascro> @sadmicrowave I don't think this is well-formed either, but I am willing to overlook it for the sake of moving forward until I find a better solution.
[07:18:57] <nascro> Can an area tag have an attribute of x and still be well-formed?
[07:18:57] <kborchers> ?data @ nascro
[07:18:58] <bot-t> nascro, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[07:19:03] <newman> opie_: Well, no. Just plain jquery. Which in this case means I could use plain javascript, I guess. So this might not be a jquery question, now that you mention it.
[07:19:17] <austinbv> Paganini: http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/9w2B5/5/
[07:19:52] <kborchers> nascro: you should try to avoid arbitrary attributes and use the data API if you can
[07:20:13] <opie_> newman: well i'm not sure about that text selection stuff, but i have used jquery ui draggable with pretty high success.
[07:20:23] <opie_> it may be kind of heavy for what you need
[07:20:45] <opie_> but it's likely if you have a draggable item you'll soon need to do more stuff then what you have, unless it's just a proof something out
[07:21:12] <newman> Heh, that might be a point ;-j..
[07:21:26] <Ivru> Hi there
[07:21:56] <opie_> maybe you just need to put the table in a jquery dialog even
[07:22:21] <opie_> then you'll get draggable and resizable for free
[07:22:34] <kborchers> newman: fwiw if you are concerned with the size of jQuery UI, you can make a custome build with the download builder to just get what is needed for the draggable widget
[07:23:19] <newman> opie_: Hm? Don't know how to do that, will have to read up on it. Sounds as if it could be interesting. Thanks.
[07:23:28] <newman> kborchers: Good point. Thanks.
[07:23:52] <Ivru> I'm using lightbox to display a image fullscreen. The element that will display the image is loaded from an ajax call. So the first call to lightboy is ok, next are not. Reading the doc, I'm trying to use the live() method in order to make it works. But calling lightbox from live method does not work. Any idea why ?

[07:25:24] <kborchers> newman: i wouldn't use dialog unless you want the title bar at the top and the close icon etc. because otherwise you have to do a bunch of CSS manipulation to remove those from dialog

[07:26:50] <daninma> @ivru I have $("body").load("p.asp")   , just not sure of what to write to pull the .html() of #updates
[07:28:22] <sadmicrowave> nascro, back
[07:30:11] <Sean-Der> Whats it he best way to clear input starting at...?
[07:30:18] <Sean-Der> I mean html
[07:30:42] <Sean-Der> <p>This is my sentence</p> Is there a way I could remove "Sentence"
[07:31:15] <Ivru> s/sentence//
[07:31:54] <tready> hi all
[07:31:54] <kborchers> Sean-Der: you'll have to get .text(), then just use substr(), then set .text()
[07:31:58] <tready>  I have a button that when clicked it collects input field values.  The first time I click it all the values are found. The second time I click it, the values are blank.  I'm not changing the values in the input fields, they are the same every time.
[07:32:24] <kborchers> ?demo @ tready
[07:32:25] <bot-t> tready, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:32:26] <Sean-Der> kborchers: Ok Thank you
[07:32:32] <tready> I know it has something to do with the $.ajax call
[07:32:42] <tready> yeah, let me paste board it
[07:32:56] <kborchers> much better if you http://jsfiddle.net it
[07:33:12] <kborchers> working code is much more helpful than just a bunch of code pasted somewhere
[07:33:21] <Sean-Der> kborchers: Substr is a PHP call?
[07:33:34] <kborchers> javascript
[07:33:49] <kborchers> string.substr(start, length)
[07:33:57] <mikeycgto> can context argument be a selector?
[07:34:15] <tready> http://pastebin.com/a6yR1jPe
[07:34:47] <Sean-Der> Kborchers: Ok thanks!
[07:35:54] <ximarin> how can i get the current value of a slider-element when I need the value by a different event than the slide?
[07:37:09] <kborchers> ximarin: are you using the jQueryUI slider?
[07:37:17] <ximarin> yep
[07:37:26] <kurisu> I have a list of images... and a more button below that pulls more images into the list using ajax... when an image is clicked a function is/should be called to do something with it.... it works with the original images that are loaded with the page but not with the ajax loaded images... the html looks good (same classes)... does anyone have any suggestions?
[07:37:26] <kborchers> .slider("value")
[07:37:52] <kurisu> *** please
[07:38:11] <kborchers> ?live @ kurisu
[07:38:11] <bot-t> kurisu, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[07:38:25] <kurisu> thanks
[07:38:31] <christo_m> anyone famliar with the jquery cycle plugin?
[07:38:48] <christo_m> is there an option to keep looping, it seems like after the 4th or so image in my cycle, it just goes blank
[07:39:07] <aaairc> does anyone know if the the Google Maps V3 API how to do a callback for once a map has fully loaded?
[07:42:12] <kurisu> kborchers: works now.... thanks
[07:42:22] <tready> that would be alot of work to reproduce that in jfiddle
[07:42:23] <kborchers> np
[07:42:24] <Rasc> hi
[07:42:40] <Rasc> anyone here familiar with the jquery-tmpl library?
[07:42:58] <kborchers> tready: it's also a lot of work for someone to try to dig through your code and figure it out without seeing it in action ;)
[07:43:00] <Paganini> sorry to be a pain, but it's still not quite giving me the result I expected :/ http://jsfiddle.net/9w2B5/6/ I thought it would be removing bar and giving me the rest of the html
[07:43:53] <Rasc> if anyone picks this up: I've compiled the query, and supplied the data
[07:43:53] <tready> oh well, guess i'll keep trouble shooting on my own.  would be next to impossible to recreate that in a timely manor
[07:44:17] <Rasc> but I want to extract the html directly ala prototype Template
[07:44:20] <Rasc> any ideas?
[07:44:51] <James13433> How would one say not first 5, for example when getting li's from ul ?
[07:45:21] <kborchers> Paganini: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/9w2B5/7/
[07:45:39] <nascro> @kborchers: regarding the data() method, why would I use that instead of, say, $('.foo').attr('attribute', 'value');
[07:46:23] <Paganini> kborchers you the man :) cheers, knew it was something daft
[07:46:27] <kborchers> because you are then adding an arbitrary attribute to the element which is technically not valid HTML
[07:46:27] <ximarin> kborchers: thx, worked great, wonder why I have overread this in the docs -.-
[07:46:50] <austinbv> Paganini: got it finally?
[07:47:15] <Paganini> austinbv: with a little help from my friends and all that :D
[07:47:27] <Paganini> yeah seems so now, I kept returning objects and all sorts of malarky
[07:47:35] <Paganini> thanks again :)
[07:49:44] <BMCouto> How can i get the wdth() of an element inside a display none parent?
[07:50:33] <Jon47> BMCouto - quickly set it to display, get the width, then go back to display:none, if you see it flicker, try making it visibility:hidden as well, or use negative margin to get it off the page while you do the calculation
[07:51:38] <austinbv> James13433: $('ul li:gt(5)')
[07:51:45] <sphinxxx> is there a difference between $(myvar).css('color')  and $myvar.css('color')
[07:51:51] <austinbv> ?:gt @ James13433
[07:51:51] <bot-t> James13433, :gt(index): Select all elements at an index greater than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[07:52:24] <nascro> @kborchers so using data() does the same thing, but prevents it from being invalid html?
[07:53:14] <BMCouto> Jon47:  I cant do that cause i use this for several elements and i dont have a rule to position the parent, so i never know how to set the parent to display block
[07:53:23] <BMCouto> isnt there any other way to do it?
[07:53:51] <austinbv> ?g html5 data attribute @ nascro
[07:53:52] <bot-t> nascro, John Resig - HTML 5 data- Attributes - http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[07:55:27] <sadmicrowave> nascro, figured it out...stupid me, when I added the new image tag for the .png you provided I didn't add the class='map' so my options within $('.map').maphilight(.....) weren't affecting it
[07:55:44] <nascro> @sadmicrowave perfect
[07:55:50] <sadmicrowave> I knew it would be something simple
[07:55:57] <kborchers> nascro: in a way, yes
[07:56:05] <nascro> @sadmicrowave glad it was
[07:57:55] <nascro> @kborchers ah, the link you posted above explains why the plugin i'm using sets the attribute as "data-reveal-id"
[07:58:10] <nascro> @kborchers starts with "data-"
[07:58:38] <kborchers> but if it's an attribute, it's not using .data ... just an attribute
[07:59:11] <nascro> @kborchers my mind is imploding
[07:59:15] <kborchers> .data will not add anything "visible" to your element as an attribute
[08:01:38] <sphinxxx> sadmicrowave:   is $(myvar).something  the same as as $myvar.something ?
[08:01:42] <sphinxxx> performance-wise
[08:01:52] <sphinxxx> or is the former calling the DOM again>
[08:01:53] <sadmicrowave> yes
[08:02:08] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: sphinxxx: no
[08:02:09] <sadmicrowave> well wait,
[08:02:13] <sadmicrowave> ^^
[08:02:20] <sadmicrowave> sorry I misread it
[08:02:35] <kborchers> if you stored the the selection in a var, then it doesn't have to traverse the dom again
[08:02:50] <kborchers> so $myvar would be faster that $(myvar)
[08:02:51] <sadmicrowave> right, it reads it from the variable
[08:02:57] <kborchers> than*
[08:03:31] <surfdue> anyone use jqplot?
[08:05:05] <austinbv> quick poll how many people in here spec test their plugins
[08:05:31] <Sean-Der> My form grabs .val from a fill in box. If I type in a letter it outputs NaN, this all makes sense. If I take it back to a number it works again
[08:05:51] <Sean-Der> However with the form validation plugin even when I change back to a number I get the ugly NaN
[08:05:59] <sphinxxx> i've been using $(myvar) up until now.. mistaken all along
[08:06:31] <sphinxxx> so even if i have var myvar =  $('#somediv');    if i then call $(myvar), it traverses DOM again
[08:06:43] <erichynds> no
[08:06:48] <erichynds> it spits out a new jquery object
[08:06:57] <erichynds> with the same DOM elements you already have
[08:07:05] <erichynds> it's still unnecessary overhead
[08:07:11] <sphinxxx> oh ok
[08:07:17] <sphinxxx> thanks for clearing that up
[08:07:34] <sphinxxx> btw has anyone used jquery masonry, for images?
[08:09:03] <nascro> @sphinxxx not for images. what's the problem?
[08:11:01] <Aristata> If I have a div, how do I insert an item as the last item in that div?
[08:11:13] <kborchers> ?append @ Aristata
[08:11:13] <bot-t> Aristata, .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[08:15:15] <SSIlver2k21> lo all
[08:17:50] <SSIlver2k21> i know its possible, but im not sure how to go forward.  I have a couple sortable elements.  2 sections, 5 items.  section1 item 1 item 2 section 2 item 3 item 4 item 5.  i want to be able to move sections around and keep thier items.  i dont know how to do that.
[08:18:22] <sphinxxx> nascro:  not really a problem yet, but i can't seem to get rid of space between images
[08:18:33] <sphinxxx> i'm trying to get it a collage where everything is right next to each other
[08:19:21] <nascro> @sphinxxx assuming css image margins are 0?
[08:19:35] <sphinxxx> yep
[08:23:23] <nascro> @sphinxxx odd, works fine for me.
[08:30:08] <Sean-Der> Is there something like PHP's Function?
[08:30:18] <Sean-Der> So I can pass variables instead of bulky JS files
[08:31:14] <aca20031> ..eh? when are you passing files
[08:31:58] <Sean-Der> I am not passing files, I am just looking for a function so I don't have to replicate code as much
[08:32:10] <Sean-Der> function prodselectnum($prodname, $num)
[08:32:16] <Sean-Der> Like this convention in PHP
[08:32:27] <aca20031> youre asking if javascript has functions? yes of course it does
[08:34:07] <Sean-Der> Do you have a tutorial or example doing a couple google searches I am not searing the right stuff..
[08:34:37] <aca20031> just google javascript functions and click the first or third link :/
[08:35:55] <Sean-Der> Sorry I was searching jQuery and get callbacks and related things
[08:38:40] <johnnydancer> What's the easiest way to tell if an element has been wrapped with $() or if it's just a straight HTML element?
[08:39:29] <jqnoob> hi, i've got a problem with superfish that i don't understant
[08:40:47] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to modify the id of multiple items like dropdown select ?
[08:40:49] <jqnoob> for those interested, it's viewable here: http://pastie.org/2309611
[08:41:03] <jqnoob> so, basically i see there is a method named onInit and another one named open
[08:41:38] <jqnoob> i'd like to have something like $("#mynode").superFish({onInit: function(){this.open("#myId")}})
[08:41:59] <jqnoob> byt obviously "this" isnt the superfish instance, hence it doesnt work the way i want it to
[08:42:01] <SoulRaven> i have multiple dropdown select with the same ID and i want to modify the ID something id="unidID-1", id="unidID-2", etc
[08:42:04] <jqnoob> what am i doing wrong?
[08:42:51] <jqnoob> i can't find an object that has a "open" method, at all.
[08:43:07] <jqnoob> neither the domnode, neither the JQ object from the original domnode, nor this
[08:43:23] <ajm_> jqnoob who is saying to do this.open(#myId") ?
[08:43:43] <jqnoob> ajm_: i am. i want it to automatically open a menu item
[08:43:52] <jqnoob> at initialization time
[08:44:20] <jqnoob> i may be totally wrong
[08:44:24] <jqnoob> but who am i to tell.
[08:44:25] <jqnoob> ideas?
[08:45:25] <jqnoob> oh sorry
[08:45:29] <jqnoob> it's not "open" it's over
[08:45:36] <jqnoob> nonetheless, same problem
[08:45:48] <jqnoob> i just wrote it wrong here on IRC
[08:46:29] <ajpiano> jqnoob, it looks like they expose a really gross method on $.fn
[08:46:37] <ajpiano> try $(this).showSuperfishUl()
[08:47:07] <jqnoob> in the onInit method?
[08:47:12] <ajpiano> yup
[08:48:09] <ajpiano> bear in mind i've never actually done this, i just looked at the source
[08:48:39] <imanc> ajpiano: is your fixingthesejquery site running?
[08:48:55] <ajpiano> yup
[08:49:00] <doubleJ> Hello...
[08:49:18] <rosco_y> hi doubleJ
[08:49:31] <imanc> must be me
[08:49:32] <jqnoob> ajpiano: besides not producing any visible results, i'd say it "works"
[08:49:42] <doubleJ> I'm having a problem with toggle() that I was hoping I could get a little help with.
[08:49:42] <jqnoob> in the sense that it doesnt come up with any errors
[08:49:57] <ajpiano> this API pretty much blows
[08:50:06] <jqnoob> the superfish one you mean?
[08:50:07] <rosco_y> Can anyone link me to some code that generates thumbnails from websites?
[08:50:12] <ajpiano> yup
[08:50:17] <jqnoob> i couldnt agree more.
[08:50:27] <jqnoob> got any better alternatives?
[08:50:36] <ajpiano> jqnoob it seems to basically go to pretty great lengths to make sure that it isn't possible to open the menu programatically
[08:51:10] <jqnoob> ah, "developer friendly" software
[08:51:10] <doubleJ> http://66.119.8.164/xml-freedownloads.php  If you notice, the Show/Hide description link works, but if you're down the page, it keeps jumping back to the top.  Is there a way to toggle in place?
[08:51:13] <jqnoob> i like
[08:51:26] <ajpiano> i mean, superfish has a good rep, i just don't think it's suited to this request
[08:52:54] <jqnoob> ajpiano: the more i look at the source the more i dont understand where this "rep" comes from
[08:53:20] <ajpiano> jqnoob, both of us are having the same experience right now i guess
[08:53:29] <ajpiano> :/
[08:53:46] <jqnoob> GAH
[08:53:55] <jqnoob> if i had more budget i'd rewrite that from scratch
[08:54:02] <polygon-pusher> Hello every one hope you all don't mind I hang out here and ask questions as I try to learn some jquery
[08:54:09] <jqnoob> since budget = time :)
[08:54:27] <rosco_y> polygon-pusher: I hope they don't mind too--that's why I'm here :)
[08:54:30] <jqnoob> oh well, good to know i'm not the only one who finds it challenging to do what i need
[08:54:58] <rosco_y> jqnoob: wow, I can't get jsTree to work for me if it kills me
[08:55:32] <rosco_y> I started being excited to discover jQuery, now I'm not so sure about that
[08:55:41] <ajpiano> doubleJ: needs moar event.preventDefault();
[08:55:50] <SoulRaven> how i find on each click the last dropdown box from the table?
[08:55:54] <rosco_y> I wish the documentation had something that it doesn't
[08:55:55] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/rZqpq/34/
[08:56:25] <jqnoob> ajpiano: so, what's left on the menu? is there something that has less of rep and more of quality?
[08:56:26] <rosco_y> I'm having a terrible time getting from A to B
[08:56:34] <SoulRaven> i mean, the last dropdown table with class gpsdevice
[08:56:54] <ajpiano> doubleJ: this what you need to do http://stackoverflow.com/questions/265478/preventdefault-on-an-a-tag
[08:57:10] <ajpiano> jqnoob: there is the jquery ui menu plugin but it isn't officially released yet
[08:57:22] <jqnoob> meaning? broken ie6?
[08:57:25] <ajpiano> it has a better API but there are still things in flux as it's like i said, not released
[08:57:28] <jqnoob> or general brokenness?
[08:57:44] <ajpiano> no meaning that there' no stable release for you to grab, it would very much be a YMMV situation and not a tonne of docs
[08:57:46] <doubleJ> ajpiano: Thanks...I'll check that out.
[08:57:57] <ajpiano> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu
[08:58:19] <ajpiano> jqnoob: there are stable-ish "milestone" releases of jQuery UI 1.9
[08:58:38] <ajpiano> but it would be up to you to figure out if the one in the most recent milestone suited your needs
[08:58:59] <ajpiano> and i suspect you're looking for something more superfish-y, just with a better API, and i don't know of anything off hand
[08:59:27] <jqnoob> eh
[09:00:30] <doubleJ> ajpiano: You are the man.  Thanks...
[09:00:42] <ajpiano> i'm just a man
[09:00:58] <rosco_y> go ahead, take a bow :)
[09:03:42] <SoulRaven> any ideea how i select on each click the last dropdown from the table? http://jsfiddle.net/rZqpq/37/
[09:04:00] <SoulRaven> i want to modify the id on each click
[09:06:27] <SoulRaven> any ideea how i select on each click the last dropdown from the table? http://jsfiddle.net/rZqpq/37/
[09:06:28] <SoulRaven> i want to modify the id on each click
[09:06:42] <jkies00> hi all, i need some selector help.  i need to count the number of divs in each table row that has two specific classes.  here a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/zcNLT/  please help me!
[09:07:49] <ajpiano> jkies00: div.marked-for-rework.marked-active
[09:07:54] <atriv> sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, but if someone could point me in the right direction -- how do you clear inherited css properties from a subclass
[09:08:27] <erichynds> overwrite them
[09:08:48] <jkies00> thanks ajp love you
[09:09:28] <atriv> right...i just wish you could specify a div subclass and have it start from scratch
[09:09:36] <atriv> as opposed to overwriting every inherited property
[09:10:16] <PhanLord> anyway one can put a message on progressbar ?
[09:10:25] <PhanLord> (whenever i do that i lose progressbar functionality
[09:11:22] <SoulRaven> any ideea how i select on each click the last dropdown from the table? http://jsfiddle.net/rZqpq/37/
[09:11:25] <SoulRaven> i want to modify the id on each click
[09:12:11] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: you want to get the last select inside of the row you just cloned?
[09:12:11] <sadmicrowave> bot-t, tell nascro: I got all the states done. http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/EXyhm/10/
[09:12:12] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, Okay.
[09:13:12] <SoulRaven> ajpiano: yes, and after that to modify the ID
[09:14:58] <keg_> im having a problem with css for jquery's autocomplete, when i hover over an item in the autocomplete it only highlights the word and I want it to highlight the entire row.
[09:16:22] <ajpiano> SoulRaven, there's so much other stuff wrong with that code... the constant extra dom querying, the unnecessary global.. the entire approach to "templating" the content
[09:16:27] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: but for what it's worth: http://jsfiddle.net/rZqpq/38/
[09:16:54] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: also i'm not sure how adding the string " - photo by Kelly Clark" is a good string to include in an element's id
[09:17:27] <ajpiano> nor do i understand why you have duplicated ideas all over the place
[09:17:50] <ajpiano> so i fixed a few of those things, hopefully it learns you smth
[09:18:02] <peritus> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6966 is not fixed in the latest 1-8-stable on github, but there is a fix with tests committed here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/f9996682b5739661c21548f0de3d4c4883c5119d/ -- where did this fix go? and why is it not included in the jquery ui 1.8 stable tree?
[09:18:05] <SoulRaven> is a demo, in fact i want to add a increment number, like gpsdeviceID-1
[09:19:30] <ajpiano> peritus: typically work is done in master for 1.9 and only backported to 1.8 if it's necessary... i would advise you just to add a comment on the commit asking why it wasn't backported to 1.8
[09:19:36] <ajpiano> cause it seems likea  bugfix
[09:20:10] <thun> Hi I call blah.hide("slide") and it works fine but Can i use those effects on ajax load?
[09:20:18] <thun> like an ajax .get
[09:22:56] <peritus> ajpiano: yeah, it is fixed in 1.9 (but in another way, in another commit, with different tests). im not sure what goes into 1.8-stable, but this really seems to be a bug fix. anyways, i will add a comment to that ticket
[09:25:03] <SoulRaven> ajpiano: any ideea way is not change the id?
[09:25:05] <plug918> hello, is there's a way to find a form element by field name?
[09:25:05] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/rZqpq/39/
[09:25:22] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: why does it need an id at all
[09:25:36] <ajpiano> none of the selects need ids, they need names...
[09:25:41] <ajpiano> which doesn' thave to be unique
[09:25:58] <aroman> Hey, how can I use a selector on a string?
[09:26:03] <SoulRaven> the is generated, with cakephp
[09:26:07] <ajpiano> a string of html aroman
[09:26:11] <ajpiano> ?
[09:26:15] <aroman> ajpiano: yes
[09:26:31] <ajpiano> $(str).filter(".selector") or $(str).find("selector")
[09:27:23] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: so does cakePHP require you to create completely useless garbage?
[09:27:35] <ajpiano> having form controls without name attributes is like a camel without humps
[09:29:02] <SoulRaven> i will try to remove the id, the big problem is another, i need to modify the name of the select
[09:29:12] <SoulRaven> from name="[Gpsdevices][0][gpsdevice]" to name="[Gpsdevices][1][gpsdevice]"
[09:29:16] <SoulRaven> and so on
[09:29:19] <aroman> ajpiano: hmm, looks like I'm actually working with an object
[09:29:24] <SoulRaven> for every click
[09:29:46] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: you might want to investigate using a client side templating solution
[09:29:54] <ajpiano> instead of having to clone and then modify the attributes
[09:31:04] <SoulRaven> ajpiano: but is it posibile to modify the name ?
[09:31:33] <ajpiano> ofc
[09:32:59] <kanzie> ajpiano: I have now re-coded my backend to return jsonp instead of plain xml and uses .jsonp() with jquery. However Im puzzled by two things, first is that it does not generate a unique callback-handle so I don't see how I can run concurrent ajax-calls. Second problem is that I keep getting syntax error in my result and I don't understand why. Please help to see what Im doing wrong. http://pastebin.com/Av13cGGv
[09:33:38] <ajpiano> that's not json
[09:33:44] <ajpiano> json has double quotes around the key names
[09:34:17] <kanzie> hmm, I wanted to avoid having to change the " in the xml since it also requires " instead of '
[09:34:25] <aroman> ajpiano: what i'm trying to do is iterate over the <li>s in a <ul>, and on each iteration know the index and also some text within that <li>.
[09:34:47] <kanzie> ajpiano: Are you saying that the only way forward is to change the ' to " and my " to '?
[09:34:59] <ajpiano> aroman: ummm $("ul li").each(function(index, elem) { });
[09:34:59] <Ogredude> today's task: Learn QUnit
[09:35:02] <ajpiano> kanzie: yep
[09:35:05] <Ogredude> morning, folks
[09:35:10] <aroman> ajpiano: that's exactly what i'm using
[09:35:16] <ajpiano> cool story
[09:35:25] <aroman> ajpiano: but "elem" just gives the entire <li>
[09:35:31] <aroman> I need to select something from that
[09:35:34] <aroman> hence my original question.
[09:35:51] <ajpiano> $(this).text();
[09:35:54] <ajpiano> $(this).find("whatever");
[09:36:00] <ajpiano> $(this).applyCriticalThinking()
[09:36:11] <aroman> why `this` and not `elem`?
[09:36:15] <ajpiano> same dif
[09:36:17] <ajpiano> this === elem
[09:36:17] <aroman> O.o
[09:36:20] <aroman> because I tried that.
[09:36:25] <kanzie> Ogredude: haha, look at that. Exactly my next issue too, writing regression-tests for all my js-code
[09:36:28] <aroman> let me try again I guess
[09:37:07] <aroman> ajpiano: yeah I get this: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLLIElement> has no method 'text'
[09:37:22] <ajpiano> aroman $(this).text() not this.text();
[09:37:24] <Ogredude> kanzie:  I'm starting off with the JavaScript Koans, that'll get me into QUnit and teach me some about how JavaScript works too
[09:37:30] <aroman> ohh
[09:37:36] <aroman> ajpiano: that would be my problem ;)
[09:37:54] <Ogredude> kanzie:  but yeah, I just finished up a bunch of UI stuff on my project, now I need to backfill tests.
[09:38:07] <kanzie> Ogredude: we are in the same boat it seems :-)
[09:38:07] <Ogredude> good news is, once I get this all figured out, I'll go test-first on it and it'll be sooooo much easier
[09:38:19] <kanzie> indeed
[09:38:25] <kanzie> Ogredude: what is javascript Koans
[09:38:41] <kanzie> Ogredude: ah, Im googling it
[09:38:46] <Ogredude> kanzie:  https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans
[09:41:58] <kanzie> Ogredude: man, this is fun! Koans FTW
[09:42:31] <Ogredude> kanzie:  ain't it, though?  I've been going through the Ruby koans for a refresher and morning warmup
[09:44:17] <kanzie> ajpiano: ok, I change the ' to " and vice versa, still get this error though
[09:44:17] <kanzie> http://pastebin.com/index/Av13cGGv
[09:44:48] <ajpiano> you didn't change it
[09:45:17] <kanzie> ajpiano: sorry, wrong pastebin
[09:45:18] <kanzie> http://pastebin.com/uenkN5Lu
[09:45:47] <Cork[home]> kanzie: you can't have litteral linebreaks inside json strings
[09:45:58] <Cork[home]> or javascript strings for that matter
[09:46:04] <Cork[home]> you need to escape them as \n
[09:46:31] <ajpiano> that too ^^
[09:47:24] <kanzie> Cork[home]: sweet,thankswould never have thought of that. Result of me trying to change the xml as little as possible and just get it to the client. Ill remove them and try again.
[09:48:19] <Cork[home]> kanzie: futher more, if you haven't cut in the xml, you have lots of unclosed tags
[09:49:15] <b-lew> Is there a good slideshow plugin that has a nice bounce effect to it?
[09:49:33] <educr0w> I have a item list generated by php, the list consists on ItemName - Add to cart link - Remove from cart link. Now I have an onclick function like addToCart(itemID) and removeFromCart(itemID) (http://www.movius.com.ar/work/cart), is possible to attach a generic click event to both links? that works like the function
[09:49:47] <cfooo> Hi im trying to make a background image switch depending on window size but i cant get the aspect ratio right... Im using "Full Size Background Image jQuery Plugin" and i've made small customizations. Can anyone help me in the right direction?

[09:55:00] <rdnck76> How can I pass extra info into jQuery.get?  For example, 'dept' here isn't what you expect it to be. http://jsfiddle.net/GqmpA/
[09:55:55] <rdnck76> edited for clarity: http://jsfiddle.net/GqmpA/1/
[09:56:20] <cypha> i can't figure out why this modal window isn't working: http://69.84.109.187:6543/login
[09:56:24] <cypha> it was working yesterday
[09:56:34] <cypha> not sure if i changed something
[09:56:44] <Ogredude> ok.  Why is this?     equals(resultOfFailedOperations == NaN, false, 'is NaN == NaN?');
[09:56:51] <cypha> Michael: hi
[09:56:52] <Michael> Does jQuery.com have a rest api?
[09:56:56] <Michael> cypha, howdy!
[09:56:56] <Ogredude> why is NaN != NaN
[09:57:05] <cypha> Michael: jabberwock?
[09:57:11] <cypha> antigua?
[09:57:14] <Michael> cypha, Aye that was my hacker alias for many years :)
[09:57:32] <cypha> aah
[09:57:39] <Michael> And I work for the mouse now so it seems more appropriate.
[09:58:02] <cypha> mouse?
[09:58:20] <Cork[home]> rdnck76: your problem is that your using the variable from the for loop, but its littealy change value in the loop, so you don't have the value you expect when the callbackc gets called
[09:58:24] <Cork[home]> *callback
[09:58:49] <Michael> cypha, Walt Disney Parks & Resorts Online (WDPRO)
[09:58:55] <cypha> thought you meant that
[09:58:58] <cypha> :)
[09:58:59] <Michael> :D
[09:59:04] <rdnck76> Cork[home]: What's the trick to get the expected behavior?
[09:59:11] <ajpiano> Ogredude: it's one of those "WTFJS" things
[09:59:13] <Michael> when I say "now" I meant for 4 years
[09:59:16] <ajpiano> that NaN != NaN
[09:59:27] <Cork[home]> rdnck76: save it in a local scope before you call get
[09:59:28] <cypha> i've heard some crazy stories !
[09:59:36] <Michael> ajpiano, Do you know if jQuery.com has a rest api? I'd love a "pepbot" lookalike in our chat room
[09:59:46] <ajpiano> Michael: it doesn't
[09:59:48] <Michael> darn
[09:59:52] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  ok, so it's just one of those things that you don't try to explain, just roll with it?
[09:59:53] <b-lew> anyone know of a well written jquery plugin that is a slideshow with the bounce effect?
[09:59:54] <ajpiano> i don't know how bot-t does it, but it's not REST
[09:59:58] <Michael> Hmmmmm
[10:00:00] <geekbuntu> Ogredude, http://uize.com/appendixes/javascript-fun.html
[10:00:01] <Michael> It's magical.
[10:00:02] <Cork[home]> rdnck76: var tmp = dept; and so on
[10:00:04] <ajpiano> Ogredude: yep.  for more of those, check out http://wtfjs.com
[10:00:29] <Michael> ? ajax

[10:00:32] <cypha> geez, that disney stuff is getting to you Michael
[10:00:42] <ohsnap> How can I write this properly $('p#element').html('<strong>Name:</strong>' owner_name); owner_name is a variable
[10:00:43] <Michael> ? accepts
[10:00:44] <geekbuntu> ajpiano, i remember this from crockfords lecture on truthy
[10:00:45] <geekbuntu> :-D
[10:00:46] <bot-t> Michael, #8777 (jQuery 1.6: undelegate() accepts custom namespaced events ... - Opened 4 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8777
[10:00:53] <Michael> cypha, lol
[10:01:04] <ajpiano> ohsnap: heard of "string concatenation"
[10:01:06] <ajpiano> +
[10:01:09] <rdnck76> Cork[home]: Inside both the loops but outside the .get? I get the idea of scope but this one is throwing me for a loop (no pun intended)
[10:01:19] <ohsnap> just like that?
[10:01:26] <ohsnap> lol, im a noob
[10:01:28] <ajpiano> ?tias
[10:01:28] <bot-t> Try It And See
[10:01:34] <ohsnap> ok!
[10:01:42] <Cork[home]> rdnck76: the loops are syncronus, the get call is not, so all values from the for loops you care about has to be stored before the call
[10:01:51] <Cork[home]> rdnck76: just before the .get call
[10:02:00] <cypha> http://69.84.109.187:6543/login why is this modal window not working? why isn't hello world looking like a button?
[10:02:30] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  ok.  I think I'll hold off on those for a while.  I just tried to read a bit of wtfjs.com and my brain exploded a little bit.  I think I need a smoke.
[10:02:56] <geekbuntu> Ogredude, oh you mean cigarettes... o.0
[10:02:59] <geekbuntu> :-D
[10:03:16] <cfooo> cypha, works for me firefox 5
[10:03:18] <Cork[home]> cypha: not saying its the cause, but drop jquery.ui.dialog.js, you don't even have the file
[10:03:34] <Ogredude> geekbuntu:  only because I'm out of other supplies at the moment ;)
[10:03:54] <geekbuntu> Ogredude, stay away from the oregano
[10:04:22] <Cork[home]> cypha: futher more jquery.modalbox.css is missing too
[10:04:24] <cypha> cfooo, Cork[home], still doesn't work
[10:04:42] <cypha> Cork[home]: it's on googleapis, how's it missing/
[10:04:43] <cypha> ?
[10:05:35] <Cork[home]> cypha: no its not http://69.84.109.187:6543/static/jquery.modalbox.css
[10:05:44] <hazamonzo> Hey folsk i use $('#now td:nth-child(1)'); to get contents of all the first colum row in my table but what if i want to return all the columns in the first row instead? (i loop through the result for other purposes)
[10:05:59] <hazamonzo> *first column rows
[10:06:35] <cfooo> No one that can help me?
[10:06:35] <Cork[home]> cypha: anyway your js works, but your missing some css to get the dialog style
[10:06:37] <geekbuntu> Cork, are you dev'l in python?
[10:06:39] <geekbuntu> or perl?
[10:06:53] <Cork[home]> geekbuntu: i can cheat in both, but i'm no expert
[10:07:21] <cypha> Cork[home]: i was workgin yesterday!
[10:07:21] <geekbuntu> Cork[home], i ask because the /static/ is the general routing for python frameworks (like bottle/webpy)
[10:07:40] <geekbuntu> Cork[home], and if static is not routed/aliased in the webserver it cannot find static files
[10:07:42] <Cork[home]> geekbuntu: i just inspect the files shared to the browser
[10:08:01] <Cork[home]> the console throws errors for those urls
[10:08:04] <ceej> is it possible to make an fn namespace like $.fn.snippet so then you can to $('div').snippet.your_plugin(); ?
[10:08:05] <odyniec> hazamonzo: try $('#now tr:first-child td')
[10:08:12] <hazamonzo> odyniec: Cheers
[10:08:36] <hazamonzo> odyniec: Works! Thank you!
[10:08:37] <geekbuntu> Cork[home], you're using pylons
[10:08:39] <Cork[home]> ceej: sure, you "just" need to return an object with your plugin names
[10:08:45] <odyniec> hazamonzo: np
[10:09:09] <hazamonzo> odyniec: dI promise to do more reading on the jquery selectors but for now i was looking for a quick solution :)
[10:09:10] <geekbuntu> Cork[home], look on their wiki how to make /static/ visible (/static/css/ , /js/ etc...)
[10:09:20] <Cork[home]> geekbuntu: why are you telling me this?
[10:09:32] <Cork[home]> geekbuntu: it's not my server
[10:09:52] <ceej> Cork[home]:  like   $.fn.snippet           = {} then add my plugins to it?
[10:10:26] <Cork[home]> ceej: ya
[10:10:30] <geekbuntu> Cork[home], sorry man - i thougth you were trying to make /static/jquery.modalbox.css web available
[10:10:36] <Cork[home]> ceej: or $.extend
[10:10:45] <ceej> I get snippet is undefined
[10:10:53] <Cork[home]> geekbuntu: cypha <--
[10:11:11] <geekbuntu> Cork[home], DOH!
[10:11:46] * geekbuntu where did i put my donut... oh yea, it's by the nuclear reactor overload button
[10:13:25] <educr0w> Cork[home]: thanks! one question..no I have addToCart(item_id), with that function delegate..how can I get the item_id if the event is attached dynamically ?
[10:13:25] <Cork[home]> ceej: $.fn.snippet = { your_plugin: function() {} }; should work
[10:13:35] <educr0w> now I have*
[10:13:41] <Cork[home]> ceej: though you lose the connection to jquery through this
[10:14:18] <Cork[home]> educr0w: where does the id come from?
[10:14:30] * Cork[home] never looked on the pastbin :P
[10:15:05] <Cork[home]> oh, it wasn't even a pastbin :D
[10:15:48] <educr0w> now It came from php, something like.. echo '<a href="#" onClick="addToCart('.$variableOfID.')" >Add</a>'
[10:16:02] <Cork[home]> educr0w: theres many ways, you could add it as data- values instead of in the call
[10:16:46] <Cork[home]> educr0w: btw, some mid old browser chokes on onClick, so if you want to use it use onclick
[10:16:52] <Cork[home]> (just a side note)
[10:18:09] <educr0w> I use onClick because I don't know how to use attaching an event
[10:18:29] <Cork[home]> educr0w: i meant use all lowercase
[10:18:44] <Cork[home]> when you use on inline events
[10:19:16] <educr0w> I have many a tags..my first issue is to attach to Add links only..the second issue is how to get each Add link the associated item_id
[10:19:43] <Cork[home]> educr0w: well as i was about to say; you could add it as data-item="$variableOfID"
[10:19:54] <Cork[home]> the access it as $(this).data('item')
[10:21:23] <b-lew> Does anyone know a well coded slideshow plugin that has a bounce effect?
[10:21:44] <b-lew> googling but can't seem to find one.
[10:22:47] <ohsnap> If I have a variable whose value is -70.61373100000003 how can I limit it to -70.6 only?
[10:22:50] <educr0w> Cork[home]: with php do I need to echo something like this '<a href="#" data-item="'.$variableOfID.'">Add</a>'?
[10:23:06] <Cork[home]> educr0w:exactly
[10:23:38] <Cork[home]> educr0w: though i personally hate the miss use of a tags >_>
[10:24:04] <austinbv> I miss tables
[10:24:09] <educr0w> nice..and do I need something like <a class="addlink" ....>Add</a> to be able to do $('addlink') to add the event..right?
[10:26:06] <educr0w> how can I do it to solve the misuse of the tag?
[10:27:44] <Cork[home]> educr0w: i personally prefer to use <span tabindex="0" class="link"></span>
[10:27:49] <ohsnap> I need to truncate the variable called latlng.lat() how can i do that?    $('p#something').html('<strong>Latitude: </strong>'+latlng.lat());
[10:27:53] <Cork[home]> educr0w: then add your events and style them
[10:28:16] <ravenzz> oh substring ?
[10:28:22] <Cork[home]> educr0w: that way you don't get those annoying #, javascript: or void(0) url's
[10:28:25] <b-lew> Does anyone know a well coded jquery slideshow plugin that has a bounce effect? googling but can't seem to find anything
[10:28:25] <snover> If it acts like a link even if it isnt a real link you ought to use <a> and get the semantic properties that implies
[10:28:25] <b-lew> maybe i'm searching the wrong terms
[10:28:35] <ravenzz> ohsnap substring ?
[10:28:52] <Cork[home]> snover: only if it really has a working link, # is not
[10:29:15] <ohsnap> ravenzz: What's that?
[10:29:42] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  this article is very useful to explain the whole NaN thing. http://uize.com/appendixes/javascript-fun.html
[10:29:53] <ravenzz> ohsnap javascript?
[10:29:53] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  easy explanation is that NaN is not equal to ANYTHING
[10:30:39] <ohsnap> ravenzz: Sure it is, but could you help me out with an example in the line I wrote please?
[10:31:00] <colin_> ajpiano?
[10:35:20] <educr0w> Cork[home]: If I use span instead a, where do I put the item_id? in the tabindex?
[10:35:38] <ravenzz> ohsnap http://jsfiddle.net/5SRXx/
[10:35:58] <Cork[home]> educr0w: the same position data-* is avalid argumetns for all tags in html5
[10:36:24] <Cork[home]> (and accepted in older html versions)
[10:36:34] <ohsnap> ravenzz: thanks! i'll try it out
[10:38:06] <ravenzz> ohsnap or maybe with Math.round
[10:38:27] <arch_adam> hi, how do the boolean of an event, ex: whether its currently moused over or not?
[10:38:45] <ohsnap> that sounds good too
[10:39:00] <Cork[home]> arch_adam: that sentens dosen't make sence
[10:39:38] <ravenzz> ohsnap http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/round.shtml
[10:39:51] <arch_adam> Cork[home], ok, how can i check wether true or false if for instance the cursor is currently over the selected element?
[10:40:29] <Cork[home]> arch_adam: you have to store that your self, theres only an event for that
[10:40:42] <arch_adam> Cork[home], do you know how?
[10:40:47] <Cork[home]> arch_adam: mouseover and mouseout
[10:41:03] <arch_adam> Cork[home], is there a manual way of doing so?
[10:41:07] <Cork[home]> then make a global variable where you store the dom element that has been hovered
[10:41:18] <phlp> ?js (-70.61373100000003).toFixed(3) @ ohsnap
[10:41:18] <bot-t> ohsnap: "-70.614"
[10:42:00] <arch_adam> Cork[home], could you explain a little more thorughly if you have the time please?
[10:42:14] <Cork[home]> arch_adam: var current; $(document).bind('mouseover', function() { current = this; });
[10:42:17] <Cork[home]> something like that
[10:42:31] <arch_adam> ok cool thank you
[10:42:38] <ohsnap> phlp: looks good to me
[10:42:44] <Cork[home]> arch_adam: sorry thats wrong
[10:42:48] <Sempri> One time... a variable saved me.
[10:42:58] <Cork[home]> arch_adam: var current; $(document).bind('mouseover', function(event) { current = event.target; });
[10:43:06] <Cork[home]> arch_adam: thats the correct one
[10:43:10] <arch_adam> ok
[10:43:31] <ravenzz> ohsnap http://jsfiddle.net/5SRXx/1/
[10:43:56] <ravenzz> id you prefer plain js
[10:43:59] <ravenzz> if*
[10:44:25] <ravenzz> oh sorry tofixed
[10:44:33] <ohsnap>  I was trying something like $('p#posicion-lat').html('<strong>Latitud: </strong>'+latlng.lat().toFixed(3)); but didn't work
[10:45:21] <ravenzz> you should look at the latlng.lat() output type
[10:45:43] <ravenzz> maybe it is a string instead of a number
[10:46:32] <ravenzz> var num = new Number(latlng.lat()); num.toFixed(4)
[10:47:31] <ohsnap> nice, let me try that!
[10:52:51] <ohsnap> ravenzz: worked! thanks a lot

[11:01:03] <ajpiano> it would just leave you with a nevada shaped <area> that overlaps california and oregon and idaho and utah and arizona
[11:01:07] <ajpiano> (for instance)
[11:01:14] * daninma wonders why sadmicrowave is sad
[11:02:34] <sadmicrowave> ajpiano, right, put if I can do an resize animation and then center it to the page, then clicked state has blown up and I can so more detailed locations within that state...then a close button for putting the state back (or removing it from the page)
[11:02:44] <sadmicrowave> put[1] = but
[11:02:58] <ajpiano> i can't help thinking you would need separate images for every state in that case
[11:04:14] <sadmicrowave> so your answer to 'can this be done' is a 'no'
[11:04:28] <ajpiano> probz
[11:04:32] <sadmicrowave> :(
[11:04:42] <sadmicrowave> well, it would have been a cool idear
[11:06:06] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to computer attr for multiple attributes on the same time?
[11:06:09] <SoulRaven> $('#greatphoto').attr('title', function(i, val) {
[11:06:09] <SoulRaven>   return val + ' - photo by Kelly Clark'
[11:06:09] <SoulRaven> });
[11:06:25] <SoulRaven> like in this example, but for multiple attributes on the same time?
[11:06:40] <sadmicrowave> SoulRaven, use a class?
[11:06:47] <SoulRaven> yes
[11:06:56] <drOptimize> could you .each through something looking for attr?
[11:07:15] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/rZqpq/40/
[11:07:18] <sadmicrowave> $('.allmyphotos').attr('title', this.value + ' - photo by Kelly Clark' );
[11:07:39] <sadmicrowave> ??
[11:07:47] <SoulRaven> i want to change the value of name and id on eac click
[11:08:13] <SoulRaven> for id i manage to do that, but now i want to change also the name value
[11:08:52] <SoulRaven> in fact to increment the name like: name="GpsDevice.0.gpsdevice" to name="GpsDevice.1.gpsdevice" and so on
[11:08:53] <sadmicrowave> $('#greatPhoto').attr({id: 'newid', name: 'newname', value: 'newvalue'});
[11:09:34] <SoulRaven> sadmicrowave; i know that, but i don't know how to do when i have the function atrribute on attr
[11:09:57] <sadmicrowave> oh
[11:10:16] <sadmicrowave> gotcha
[11:10:17] <sadmicrowave> hold on
[11:10:25] <SoulRaven> thx:)
[11:11:14] <Sean-Der> I am looking to get a .val for 5-10 fields they all end with 'final'. Is it possible to use wild cards like the Linux *final? So I could do a Var1 + Var2 + Var3?
[11:12:10] <drOptimize> Sean-Der: you could test against the id (or whatever) with some regex (just like linux) ;)
[11:13:25] <bot-t> Sean-Der, [attribute$=value]: Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value ending exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[11:13:35] <kborchers> Sean-Der: when you say the fieds end with 'final', you mean the id, a class, or what
[11:13:47] <Sean-Der> It can be id or class
[11:13:56] <Sean-Der> I would prefer ID as i am using class for form validation
[11:14:52] <kborchers> Sean-Der: $([id$='final']).each(add the .val()'s here)
[11:15:36] <kborchers> Sean-Der: fyi, you can have multiple classes on a single element
[11:16:32] <Sean-Der> kborchers: So that will loop through and grab them all and then how I would I do then math $id + current = current?
[11:16:36] <sadmicrowave> SoulRaven, I was thinking about something like this, (but it doesn't work) http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/vvQVL/
[11:16:55] <Sean-Der> Is it better to go with classes I am just worried it will become unwiedly
[11:17:06] <kborchers> Sean-Der: sorry probably needs to be  $("[id$='final']").each(add the .val()'s here)
[11:17:39] <kborchers> then you just have a var initialized outside of the each to 0 and then do thatVar += $(this).val();
[11:17:45] <kborchers> inside the each
[11:18:15] <JonoB> I am trying to toggle the first row in a table using $("tr:nth-child(1)").toggle(); However, (1) hides the thead, and (2) hides the second table row
[11:18:18] <Sean-Der> Ok I am gonna mess with all this logic now.
[11:18:30] <Sean-Der> I am gonna switch to class is that a good idea?
[11:18:48] <sadmicrowave> JonoB, try $('tr:first-child')
[11:18:56] <sadmicrowave> or $('tr').first()
[11:19:25] <SoulRaven> sadmicrowave: i have try like this, and is not working, i have try erlier
[11:19:30] <rosco_y> This is a test.  I want to see if can use google docs as a pastbin/imagebin:  http://tinyurl.com/3cqjwts
[11:19:46] <kborchers> Sean-Der: class would actually be different
[11:20:40] <kborchers> you would need to do something like $("input").is("theClass");
[11:20:40] <Sean-Der> I can't just class$='final'
[11:20:59] <Sean-Der> and it will catch any fields that fulfill
[11:21:10] <kborchers> would be simpler though as you could just assign a single class name, no need for different classes that end in final
[11:21:34] <JonoB> sadmicrowave: same result...but doing $(tbody tr:first-child) works!
[11:21:45] <sadmicrowave> JonoB, cool
[11:21:56] <JonoB> ty
[11:22:12] <JonoB> (for the help)
[11:22:14] <kborchers> Sean-Der: if you can just assign them all a single class, then do $("input").is("theClass"); that would be better
[11:22:38] <sadmicrowave> SoulRaven, sorry dude, I've never used the attr callback before. kborchers any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/vvQVL/
[11:22:39] <Sean-Der> kborchers: Ok thank you thats what I am going to do
[11:22:53] <jqUser> hello
[11:22:56] <kborchers> actually that would be better as $("input.theClass").each(
[11:23:00] <rosco_y>  hi jqUser
[11:23:15] <jqUser> I can embed SVG directly into an HTML document and this works with latest FF, IE and Chrome.
[11:23:18] <kborchers> Sean-Der^^
[11:23:36] <jqUser> For FF 3.6.18 (this is what I have to test), this does not work.
[11:23:40] <jqUser> Is this expected behavior?
[11:24:11] <kborchers> jqUser: where is the jQuery part of that question?
[11:24:40] <sadmicrowave> oh yea! ^ that just happened
[11:24:47] <jqUser> And, I've seen some examples (i.e. wih the svg-edit jquery plugin/app) where it appears that they got it to work without an embed/object
[11:24:49] <sadmicrowave> :P
[11:25:03] <jqUser> ditto for the jquery svg plugin
[11:25:26] <jqUser> tried looking under the hood but for the life of my can't seem to figure out what they're doing
[11:26:00] <colin_> ajpiano still there?
[11:28:22] <daleharvey> anyone ever use flot, this is majorly doing my head in
[11:29:01] <daleharvey> trying to do a stacked bar graph, http://couch.arandomurl.com/ping/_design/webui/index.html for some reason firefox's last value always overlays the others
[11:29:01] <rosco_y> daleharvey: I'm starting to see this kind of complaint a lot here.  I'm having the same kind of luck with jsTree
[11:31:55] <colin_> i could use some help with draggable/droppable
[11:36:27] <rubyruy> is there a way to bind something at the beginning of a callback chain?
[11:36:56] <rubyruy> or perhaps during capture? :/
[11:37:33] <mikeycgto> can you explain a bit more rubyruy?
[11:37:41] <SoulRaven> rubyruy: somethning like: http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[11:38:05] <rubyruy> well specifically what i'm trying to do is trigger a focus event without notifying any handlers
[11:38:33] <m0dmd> Hello Everyone!
[11:38:40] <rubyruy> i.e. register a handler with  event.stopImmediatePropagation(), then run focus(), then unbind the handler
[11:38:50] <rubyruy> but any handlers registered beforehand will still be ran
[11:38:57] <m0dmd> Can someone let me know how I can get the next section -> http://jsfiddle.net/8V7pN/23/
[11:39:13] <gnarf> rubyruy: how hacky you willing to go?
[11:39:25] <rubyruy> not very hacky as this will have to make its way back into jquery-core :(
[11:39:28] <m0dmd> I'm trying to move the #nav if it is :above-the-top
[11:39:35] <gnarf> cuz you could unshift the function into .data('events').focus
[11:39:40] <gnarf> but other than that, no
[11:39:49] <rubyruy> hmm
[11:39:54] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to call multiple callback on the same attr?
[11:40:13] <rubyruy> gnarf: this is re this ticket btw, i assume it's the same gnarf ;) https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/411
[11:40:31] <SoulRaven> somethning like: .attr('id', function({}))
[11:40:36] <rubyruy> i realized that re-focusing manually will also trigger focus handlers in an unobvious, unpretictable way :/
[11:40:41] <rubyruy> which should probably be avoided
[11:40:54] <gnarf> rubyruy: did you ever actually file the ticket?
[11:41:08] <rubyruy> i'm was in the proccess of doing it
[11:41:14] <rubyruy> like i have a window open with trac and whatnot
[11:41:18] <rubyruy> and then i realized this would be a problem
[11:41:20] <SoulRaven> somethning like: .attr('id', function(){}, 'name', function(){})
[11:41:21] <gnarf> cool, thanks :)
[11:41:35] <gnarf> solve the problem later - file the ticket now ;)
[11:42:00] <hazamonzo> easiest way to select the first td in the second tr ?
[11:42:01] <rubyruy> well sure :p
[11:42:34] <gnarf> hazamonzo: $("tr").eq(1).find("td").first()
[11:42:37] <SoulRaven> tr:gt(1)
[11:42:42] <hazamonzo> gnarf: Skills! :D
[11:43:40] <SoulRaven> somethning like: .attr('id', function(){}, 'name', function(){})? is it posibile ?
[11:43:45] <rosco_y> does anyone know of a jQuery library that captures websites as thumbnails?
[11:43:58] <gnarf> SoulRaven: tried .attr({ id: fn, name: fn });
[11:44:04] <gnarf> like the .css({ }) method?
[11:44:08] <gnarf> cuz i think that works
[11:44:25] <gnarf> rosco_y: no, not possible
[11:44:39] <m0dmd> any ideas anyone, I mean I put an example in jsfiddle
[11:44:41] <SoulRaven> gnarf: is not working for me, because i nead callback to process the id and name
[11:45:05] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: use a bloody .each(fn)
[11:45:08] <gnarf> how is it "not working"
[11:46:05] <daninma> @rosco_y I think this is what your looking for - http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/content/thumbnail
[11:46:16] <ajpiano> SoulRaven: $("whatever").each(function() { var t = $(this), id = this.id, name = t.name;  t.attr({id: "newId", name: "newName"+ name});     });
[11:47:24] <gnarf> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/uRkS4/
[11:48:11] <gnarf> appears to work to me
[11:48:22] <gnarf> at least in jQuery 1.6+
[11:48:26] <gnarf> ?attr
[11:48:26] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[11:48:51] <gnarf> that should go back tho
[11:48:56] <SoulRaven> gnarf: i neead http://jsfiddle.net/rZqpq/40/
[11:49:15] <SoulRaven> to modify the name and the id on the same time when i click to add a new row
[11:49:30] <gnarf> SoulRaven: read my fn fiddle
[11:49:31] <gnarf> it works
[11:49:36] <ajpiano> nice gnarf
[11:49:54] <rubyruy> ok i made ticket http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7595
[11:50:12] <endurans> trying tabs on local machine (not file open, server at  localhost) makes the tabs to re-load the page also inside each panel, it's a bug? or any way to prevent that?
[11:50:24] <rubyruy> am now thinking $.fn.bindFirst() would maybe be worth considering ;)
[11:50:25] <rosco_y> daninma: Thank you :)
[11:50:45] <daninma> np.
[11:51:01] <rosco_y> Thanks gnarf (are you talking about my google.docs test?
[11:51:21] <sadmicrowave> gnarf++
[11:51:59] <m0dmd> yo ajpiano
[11:52:13] <endurans>  I'm using ui 1.8.14 and jquery. 1.5.1
[11:52:30] <saimon69> hmm i had to downgrade to ff 3.6 because was unable to make anytihng work on ff 5
[11:52:43] <ajpiano> sup m0dmd
[11:53:54] <m0dmd> hey hyey hey
[11:54:07] <m0dmd> think you could give me a hand with -> http://jsfiddle.net/8V7pN/34/
[11:55:20] <b-lew> anyone know a jquery gallery that has a bounce effect?
[11:55:31] <Sean-Der> kborchers: http://pastebin.com/qPPEeWrX What do you think?
[11:55:33] <b-lew> that is also coded well
[11:55:35] <m0dmd> how can make it so that it finds the next .sec
[11:56:03] <larzen-wrk> question - if I have a jquery object in the form of a variable, can I do searches of its subcomponents. For example var myDiv.find('.somePattern .somePattern2'); <-- is there such a thing?
[11:56:40] <kborchers[A]> Sean-Der: what the???
[11:57:16] <kborchers> Sean-Der: what is the delegate for? there will not be a change event on body
[11:57:26] <cypha> how can I use firebug to tell me which script and link files in my html are valid?
[11:57:43] <kborchers> Sean-Der: $("input").is("finalPrice"); does nothing that is where i said to do an each
[11:58:05] <kborchers> Sean-Der: just a sec
[11:59:13] <yobrednoy> hello.  how do I use an if tag with the index variable in an each template tag nested in the each tag?  as in http://jsfiddle.net/nderraugh/xJ49c/ .. it seems to be true on every iteration through the data set and not just when the index is equal to 1
[11:59:38] <kborchers> Sean-Der: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Ry6XB/ that is how you'll get your total
[11:59:43] <winux> how do i go about selecting a class, and replacing it with another, for only one specific div among multiple divs?
[12:00:07] <kborchers> Sean-Der: not sure what you were trying to accomplish with delegate
[12:00:32] <Sean-Der> Oops I was gonna break my variable every loop
[12:01:28] <kborchers> Sean-Der: you didn't even have a loop
[12:01:36] <Sean-Der> The page is made up of a bunch of Ajax calls. Internet Explorer for some reason has been pissy without it. Also had to put a random .get()
[12:02:00] <Sean-Der> Thank you for the help kborchers
[12:02:07] <kborchers> Sean-Der: then something else is seriously wrong
[12:02:50] <Sean-Der> It works in all other browsers perfectly. IE didn't work well with passing variables in .load()
[12:03:16] <Sean-Der> Sorry I have only been at this since monday I am still confused alot
[12:03:42] <kborchers> Sean-Der: can you paste all of your JS ... just to satisfy my curiousity?
[12:04:27] <winux> or can i select a div based on an ID, then change its class ??

[12:05:50] <soule> thanks
[12:05:55] <ProLoser|Work> hello
[12:05:56] <winux> kborchers: one catch.. i have multiple divs with that same class, i need to change only one
[12:05:59] <ProLoser|Work> i'm working with an entirely ajax website
[12:06:10] <ProLoser|Work> does anyone have a plugin that forces a cache refresh on every page request?
[12:06:26] <soule> I have a GET function, and based on the callback response, if the PHP returned "EXISTS" I want to kill the function
[12:06:37] <soule> this callback function is in a get function is in a button press function
[12:06:42] <winux> kborchers: ah nvm
[12:06:43] <soule> i want to kill the button press function
[12:06:53] <drOptimize> soule, return false;
[12:06:57] <soule> yah
[12:07:01] <soule> but the problem
[12:07:02] <soule> if i call
[12:07:07] <soule> return false in the callback
[12:07:11] <soule> it just kills the callback
[12:07:15] <soule> not the button press function
[12:07:23] <soule> I tried setting a var called killswitch
[12:07:28] <soule> by default true
[12:07:35] <Sean-Der> kborchers: Do you see what I am talking about?
[12:07:40] <soule> and if it exists, set it to false
[12:07:45] <drOptimize> what about return callback() where callback = function () {return false}
[12:07:52] <soule> then wrote return killswitch
[12:08:00] <soule> what do u mean?
[12:08:10] <soule> how can i use that?
[12:08:13] <drOptimize> What function are you trying to escape?
[12:08:29] <soule> let me explain:
[12:08:33] <soule> i have
[12:08:36] <ProLoser|Work> do you guys have any plugins for ajax dev for refreshing cache?
[12:08:43] <soule> $("#add_form").submit(function(){
[12:08:45] <soule> then i have
[12:08:49] <soule> $.ajax({
[12:08:55] <soule> then i have
[12:08:55] <soule> success: function(msg){
[12:09:02] <soule> i want to kill the add_form.submit
[12:09:14] <phlp> soule: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault
[12:09:31] <sadmicrowave> ProLoser|Work, do you know if 'break' has the same type of functionality in js as it does in PHP when it is used to 'break' out of a while or for loop...my thought it maybe he can use it here...
[12:09:50] <soule> @phip how do i use that?
[12:10:03] <phlp> look at the example
[12:10:03] <soule> cause based on the docs i dont see how it will work out
[12:10:06] <yobrednoy> ah.. i figured it out. thank you. ;P
[12:10:23] <sadmicrowave> oooh, yes, he needs e.preventDefault() if he is trying to prevent the submit form from executing
[12:10:26] <ProLoser|Work> sadmicrowave: i don't know, try it and see
[12:10:33] <soule> Okay
[12:10:47] <soule> let me try putting it in my callback
[12:10:48] <drOptimize> phlp, it would still just kill the click
[12:10:52] <soule> yup
[12:10:55] <soule> thats what i want
[12:10:58] <drOptimize> not the original function that he's trying to get out of
[12:11:10] <soule> i think we have a miscomunication
[12:11:17] <drOptimize> yeah, my bad
[12:11:17] <soule> Im trying to kill the click function
[12:11:28] <phlp> soule: $("#add_form").submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault();  /* do ajax */ });
[12:11:29] <drOptimize> yeah, thats what I though
[12:12:24] <sadmicrowave> drOptimize, no, it has to be within a loop or switch statement
[12:12:41] <sadmicrowave> ^'break'
[12:12:56] <kborchers> Sean-Der: i really have no idea what is going on there. it looks like you have a bunch of functions you don't need to do delegates when you could probably just use bind but i'm just really confused.
[12:13:04] <drOptimize> sadmicrowave: what is that "no" to? did i ask/state something?
[12:13:04] <kborchers> gotta go to a meeting ... back in a bit
[12:13:11] <soule> Wait
[12:13:13] <soule> phip
[12:13:20] <soule> I want to kill it
[12:13:25] <sadmicrowave> drOptimize, 'no' putting 'break' in the function does not work
[12:13:26] <soule> from the AJAX function
[12:13:34] <drOptimize> did i say break?
[12:13:51] <sadmicrowave> drOptimize, you told me to try it and see, so I did, and I was letting you know what I found
[12:14:05] <b-lew> Can anyone help me out?
[12:14:12] <drOptimize> i never said anythign about "break"
[12:14:24] <sadmicrowave> nvm

[12:17:18] <phlp> soule: preventDefault like i showed you and when the ajax finishes, if it's not a dupe then set a flag (give the form 'valid' class or something) and call submit from the ajax callback
[12:17:45] <soule> what do u mean "call submit"?
[12:17:57] <phlp> $("#add_form").submit()
[12:18:31] <sadmicrowave> soule, http://pastebin.com/gnQGveqE
[12:18:48] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: Will that cause a cycle?
[12:19:10] <sadmicrowave> oh, I thought the main event was a .click not .submit() sorry I didn't see that
[12:20:31] <soule> So it won't wokr?
[12:20:32] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: Perhaps send some data with the event?
[12:20:41] <Eviltwin> A flag that indicates that we actually want to submit
[12:20:52] <soule> What you mean we already want to submit
[12:20:55] <soule> it's already submitted
[12:21:07] <soule> I want to kill the submit function
[12:21:32] <soule> so the user has to change the entered information so its not a duplicate then try submitting again
[12:21:57] <soule> my idea was to set a var called killswitch = true
[12:22:01] <soule> if its a duplicate
[12:22:04] <soule> set killswitch to false
[12:22:07] <soule> then return killswitch
[12:22:17] <soule> But i found that return true ends up killing it anyway :/
[12:22:27] <Eviltwin> Hold on a sec
[12:23:11] <Eviltwin> Your goal is that when the user submits the form, it runs an AJAX first and depending on that outcome, it actually submits or not?
[12:23:48] <sadmicrowave> soule, http://pastebin.com/q8vzHkRE ??
[12:23:57] <soule> my goal is:
[12:24:20] <soule> When the user hits the submit button, his entered info gets checked VIA AJAX to see if it's a duplicate
[12:24:24] <soule> If it isa  duplocate
[12:24:33] <soule> then kkill the submit function
[12:24:40] <sadmicrowave> I feel like alot of frusteration would/could be avoided if you bound this ajax call on a user .click() instead of .submit()
[12:24:41] <soule> and make the user change infromation
[12:24:43] <Eviltwin> Okay, let me test real quick
[12:24:48] <soule> Okay
[12:24:53] <soule> i was thinking too
[12:24:58] <soule> Practicality > Purity
[12:25:24] <Eviltwin> soule: What sadmicrowave's suggesting is correct however if the form is submitted via enter key or something, I'm not sure what the behavior is
[12:25:35] <Eviltwin> Could be browser-dependent
[12:25:38] <soule> It's still submit
[12:25:50] <Eviltwin> But it's not click
[12:25:50] <soule> I guess the safest method is to bind it via Submit button press
[12:25:52] <sadmicrowave> soule, hes talking about my .click()
[12:26:08] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave's var bKill just flat out won't work
[12:26:15] <Eviltwin> I can tell you that right now
[12:26:32] <Eviltwin> However a synchronous AJAX may solve your problem
[12:26:40] <soule> So if i bind it to submit button press i can just use $("add_form).serialize()
[12:26:41] <soule> right?
[12:26:53] <soule> So i think i will save the troubles and just bind to a button .click
[12:27:01] <soule> will that make microwave's solution work?
[12:27:03] <Eviltwin> Can you paste your original again?
[12:27:06] <b-lew> Can I grab some jquery help?
[12:27:17] <sadmicrowave> b-lew, just ask your question
[12:27:17] <Eviltwin> I'm going to make a change that might fix it
[12:27:44] <soule> http://pastebin.com/FEEY1iEU
[12:27:51] <soule> Im gonna make it
[12:27:52] <soule> b
[12:27:55] <b-lew> http://slidesjs.com/ -> i want to use this slideshow for my website but I don't know how to get it to use the bounce effect
[12:27:55] <soule> bind 2 button click
[12:28:35] <Eviltwin> Try this: http://pastebin.com/gDKEZB50
[12:28:41] <mythmon> has any one used the gantt chart plugin for flot? i can't seem to get it to actually show the plot.
[12:29:37] <drOptimize> b-lew: look for function function animate(direction,effect,clicked) and change the effect
[12:29:37] <soule> interesting
[12:29:40] <soule> that's excaclty
[12:29:41] <plug918> hello, how do i return a list of attributes for an element?
[12:29:44] <soule> what i already did
[12:29:57] <sadmicrowave> soule, I don't understand, why are you trying to 'kill' the submit function AFTER the results of submitting come back?
[12:30:10] <phlp> he added async:false (took the easy way out) :P
[12:30:19] <drOptimize> plug, you could pass along the whole jquery object for the node and search the attr from there?
[12:30:25] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: He's using the the result of the AJAX to decide if the form is ready to submit
[12:30:41] <Eviltwin> soule: Did the async: false not work?
[12:30:46] <soule> oops
[12:30:55] <Eviltwin> phlp: Easy way out but really makes sense in this case
[12:30:57] <soule> ok
[12:30:59] <soule> 1 sec
[12:31:00] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, but look at the definition of dupstr...it is the .serialize() results of the form...meaning he already submitted the form in the ajax
[12:31:03] <soule> let me add that
[12:31:05] <b-lew> ? drOptimize in the slides.min.jquery.js file?
[12:31:06] <bot-t> b-lew, Couldn't find "drOptimize in the slides.min.jquery.js file?" in jQuery Docs.
[12:31:13] <soule> i already submitted by the way
[12:31:19] <sadmicrowave> see
[12:31:26] <drOptimize> b-lew i would look for the full dev version if available, but yes
[12:32:07] <sadmicrowave> so who cares about preventDefault or whatever...if msg == 'EXISTS' alert something, else, alert something else...who cares about 'killing' who happened in the past
[12:32:30] <garbagegod> i once found this one word function that allowed you to hide a div
[12:32:37] <garbagegod> by sliding it from left to right or vice versa
[12:32:46] <garbagegod> and ive searched all over the internet and jquery website and cant find it
[12:32:53] <sadmicrowave> .hide()
[12:32:59] <eddiemonge> you mean like slideIn?
[12:32:59] <soule> Guys let me explain my script;
[12:33:00] <b-lew> Ok drOptimize I found that function
[12:33:13] <phlp> i just assumed dupe_check was a dupe check not dupe_check_if_no_dupe_create_it
[12:33:30] <soule> AFTER the user submits the form: Run AJAX request to check if its a duplicate
[12:33:32] <Ogredude> I'm not finding any recent information on using QUnit to test the Javascript in a Rails project.  Anyone know of anything current?
[12:33:33] <soule> IN that ajax call
[12:33:43] <soule> if it is a duplicate (msg==exists)
[12:33:50] <soule> then I want to KILL the SUMBIT function
[12:33:51] <garbagegod> slideIn dosent work at all for me
[12:33:53] <soule> otherwise
[12:33:56] <soule> move on
[12:33:56] <garbagegod> and its not hide()
[12:34:01] <garbagegod> hide fades
[12:34:06] <garbagegod> i dont want it to fade
[12:34:09] <garbagegod> it also changes the size
[12:34:17] <garbagegod> i found one before that was perfect i just cant find it
[12:34:18] <sadmicrowave> soule, how can you 'kill the submit function' when you've already submitted the form? what are you trying to kill?
[12:34:29] <phlp> soule: i offer this http://pastebin.com/0KAe63Cm
[12:34:30] <sadmicrowave> theres nothing left to kill because the submit already took place
[12:34:43] <Eviltwin> soule: After the user presses the submit button, hold the actual submission until you check for duplicates. If it's a duplicate, don't actually submit, stay on the same page?
[12:34:45] <soule> I just want to stop the rest of the code
[12:34:45] <soule> so
[12:34:47] <Eviltwin> Is that correct
[12:34:55] <soule> it wont say
[12:34:55] <soule> alert('kill failed');
[12:34:59] <plug918> hello, how to i find the elment type in jquery?
[12:35:18] <plug918> for example, an <input>  element will identify as text
[12:35:36] <Cork[home]> ?atttr @ plug918
[12:35:37] <bot-t> plug918, Attributes - These methods get and set DOM attributes of elements. http://api.jquery.com/category/attributes/
[12:35:43] <Cork[home]> grr
[12:35:49] <Cork[home]> ?attr @ plug918
[12:35:49] <bot-t> plug918, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[12:35:54] <soule> @evil im testing  that out
[12:36:10] <Eviltwin> soule: It will still show that alert but it won't submit the form
[12:36:18] <soule> The thing is
[12:36:20] <sadmicrowave> plug918, $(this).attr('tag')
[12:36:29] <soule> I dont want the alert to show
[12:36:33] <soule> Below the alert,
[12:36:37] <soule> is another AJAX
[12:36:41] <soule> so if its not a dupe
[12:36:50] <soule> submit the form and add the info to my DB
[12:36:57] <plug918> sadmicrowave:  that return undefined
[12:36:57] <Eviltwin> Oh, that's far easier....
[12:37:01] <soule> Yeah
[12:37:06] <Eviltwin> You put that other AJAX inside the success of the first one
[12:37:09] <soule> Exactly
[12:37:12] <drOptimize> b-lew: i think what your looking for is the easing function used to animate the slide show. Look into easing, jquery UI comes with some extra stuff like bounce....
[12:37:14] <Eviltwin> So do that...
[12:37:15] <soule> I was just typing that
[12:37:20] <soule> Ugh
[12:37:21] <soule> i feel bad
[12:37:26] <Eviltwin> We thought you were trying to stop the submit of the form conditionally
[12:37:32] <soule> sorry guys for wastig you time
[12:37:37] <b-lew> isn't jquery ui pretty bloated for just a bounce gallery?
[12:37:49] <sadmicrowave> plug918, var tag = this.nodeName ?
[12:38:22] <drOptimize> probably, but jquery only comes with two easing functions stock
[12:38:39] <plug918> sadmicrowave:  i tried $(this).nodeName, but still return nothing for an textarea
[12:38:47] <kborchers> b-lew: UI is not "bloated" if you need the whole thing. if you only need part of it, use the download builder and only download the pieces you need
[12:38:53] <drOptimize> there's swing and linear... writing your own easing function is a bit out of my scope
[12:39:06] <duttons> hi all .. would anyone have a moment just to have a look at a plugin with me and figure out how to implement it... I have a URL..  and just need some advice on how best to work a plugin with another script.
[12:39:06] <sadmicrowave> plug918, no it's this.nodeName - not $(this)
[12:39:20] <soule> This is what I came up with
[12:39:20] <soule> http://pastebin.com/VQdMpLbE
[12:39:55] <Eviltwin> soule: Are you never going to browser submit?
[12:40:04] <soule> what do u mean?
[12:40:15] <soule> it submits when user presses button
[12:40:47] <phlp> just move the preventDefault outside the callback and call it a day
[12:40:51] <Eviltwin> If you have <form action="foobar.php"><input type="submit" value="Submit!"></form>
[12:40:55] <Eviltwin> And you press that "Submit!" button
[12:41:07] <Eviltwin> The browser will create a POST to /foobar.php
[12:41:15] <Eviltwin> And display that page in the browser in place of the current page
[12:41:29] <duttons> I am trying to get this  http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm  onto this http;//chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html .  I need the zoom to work on the imageWrapper or Displayed div on hover.
[12:42:02] <duttons> http://chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html   sorry
[12:42:07] <soule> http://pastebin.com/cdnMF1mU
[12:42:08] <soule> my form
[12:42:13] <soule> i dont do action = foobar
[12:42:19] <duttons> could anyone help at all?
[12:42:22] <soule> i do action="javascript:"
[12:42:30] <Eviltwin> soule: Okay, I see
[12:42:46] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure you even need a preventDefault then
[12:42:49] <soule> yeah
[12:42:51] <soule> i got rid of that
[12:43:04] <eddiemonge> soule: that is so bad
[12:43:09] <soule> why
[12:43:49] <eddiemonge> soule: turn off javascript and then ask that
[12:43:57] <soule> What do u mean?
[12:44:04] <soule> turn off javascript
[12:44:08] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: <noscript>You're f**ked</noscript>
[12:44:18] <soule> What do you mean
[12:44:20] <snover> yes, best not to say fucked
[12:44:29] <soule> I'm confused
[12:44:39] <soule> is my
[12:44:46] <soule> <form action="javascript:">
[12:44:49] <soule> bad?
[12:44:59] <Eviltwin> soule: What happens if the dup_check exists and you go ahead and submit anyway?
[12:44:59] <eddiemonge> yes
[12:45:01] <eddiemonge> very
[12:45:02] <Cork[home]> ugg. ya
[12:45:14] <soule> well
[12:45:18] <soule> that shouldnt happen
[12:45:22] <Eviltwin> If it did
[12:45:24] <soule> if we have duplicates in DB
[12:45:25] <Eviltwin> Would there be a problem?
[12:45:29] <soule> Not really
[12:45:42] <Eviltwin> Is there any reason that the second call doesn't just return a "this already existed"?
[12:45:44] <soule> just it would not be good to have when displaying data
[12:45:49] <Eviltwin> Effectively make this one backend call
[12:45:51] <soule> my php returns
[12:45:59] <soule> function duplicateCheck($address, $name)
[12:45:59] <soule> {
[12:45:59] <soule> 	$dquery = "SELECT * FROM stores WHERE LOWER(REPLACE(address, ',', ''))='$address' and LOWER(name)='$name';";
[12:46:00] <soule> 	$dup_check = mysql_query($dquery);
[12:46:00] <soule> 	if (mysql_num_rows($dup_check)>0)
[12:46:00] <soule> 		echo "EXISTS";
[12:46:00] <soule> 	else
[12:46:01] <soule> 		echo "OK";
[12:46:01] <soule> }
[12:46:07] <soule> So basically
[12:46:14] <ajpiano> soule: use a pastebin
[12:46:15] <Eviltwin> And the other call?
[12:46:19] <soule> ok
[12:46:29] <soule> the second ajax
[12:46:32] <soule> says
[12:46:40] <soule> OK asweall
[12:46:54] <kborchers> soule: please don't paste code like that
[12:46:57] <soule> Sorry
[12:47:02] <soule> thought it was short enough
[12:47:11] <ajpiano> soule: 1 line is short enough
[12:47:13] <soule> il use pastebin nextime
[12:47:14] <soule> ok
[12:47:19] <Eviltwin> I'd say definitely no more than 3
[12:47:22] <soule> ok
[12:47:26] <soule> ok
[12:47:32] <eddiemonge> soule: use jsfiddle
[12:47:33] <kborchers> Eviltwin: no more than 1
[12:47:48] <soule> Okay i understand that.
[12:47:53] <Eviltwin> soule: sed s/\n//;
[12:47:53] <phlp> soule: use smoke signals
[12:47:55] <soule> wont do nextime
[12:48:05] <kborchers> phlp: lol
[12:48:06] <soule> whats smoke signals..?
[12:48:09] <soule> ohh
[12:48:12] <duttons> Gents, really sorry to keep asking for help..  but I really need some assistance / advice to move a page forward.. I am so stuck.. and not sure what to do.. any help available for a min?
[12:48:13] <soule> ahah
[12:48:13] <sadmicrowave> lol
[12:48:23] <Eviltwin> duttons: Ask your question
[12:48:32] <soule> I thought smokesignals was some sort of jquery function
[12:48:39] <sadmicrowave> lol
[12:48:42] <Cork[home]> ?ask @ duttons
[12:48:43] <bot-t> duttons, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:48:45] <duttons> I am trying to get this  http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm  onto this http;//chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html .  I need the zoom to work on the imageWrapper or Displayed div on hover.
[12:49:02] <ajpiano> move forward: history.go(1);
[12:49:05] <duttons> http://chicfreakz.co.uk/flowergirls.html   sorry
[12:49:14] <sadmicrowave> ajpiano, lol
[12:49:29] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave: i thought that was the actual question :/
[12:49:40] <ajpiano> oh god this girl is totes gonna start haunting my dreams
[12:49:45] <sadmicrowave> which makes it even funnier
[12:49:54] <duttons> I need to add class on hover but then I am stuck on how to initiate the other plugin and where to point it to ..
[12:52:03] <sadmicrowave> duttons, instead of doing multiple .attr() for each attribute just do .attr({src: value.src, title: value.title, alt: value.srcBig});
[12:52:03] <duttons> Eviltwin: I do ask the question but dont seem to get too much of a response.. but would really appreciate some help..
[12:52:27] <Sean-Der> I am getting .val for text input boxes. But when I try to add numbers together it just concates them? So if I do ValA(1) + ValB(2) I expect 3, but get 12
[12:52:32] <phlp> duttons it doesnt help that your url looks like its for a porn site
[12:52:45] <eddiemonge> duttons: if you cant get the help you need here, it may be time to look into paid support
[12:52:50] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, parseFloat( yourval )
[12:52:57] <djQuery> anyone know how to add an icon to a ui.dialog button?
[12:53:00] <Cork[home]> Sean-Der: input boxes return strings
[12:53:17] <Cork[home]> Sean-Der: so use pareseInt or parseFloat depending on what you want
[12:53:17] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: thanks for the advice..
[12:53:33] <Sean-Der> ok I will look at those
[12:53:35] <ravenzz> djQuery use the background css property?
[12:53:50] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: would you be able to advise on my issue?  in terms of getting a plugin to work with this..
[12:54:09] <sadmicrowave> Sean-Der, its because .val() just gets the text within the value attribute as a string..you need to convert it
[12:54:15] <larzen-wrk> question.. i wrote my own jq component. When i call $('.someDiv').floorPlans();  $('.someDiv').floorPlans();  it creates the entity twice... i notice that jquery UI components don't do that.
[12:54:23] <larzen-wrk> did I do something wrong? Any suggestions?
[12:54:26] <sadmicrowave> duttons, I'm looking
[12:54:47] <austen> Sean-Der: your values in ValA and ValB are STRINGS because they come from a text input. do eval(ValA)+eval(ValB);
[12:54:50] <Sean-Der> I was adding strings together now that I change my type to (int) it should work thank you
[12:54:53] <djQuery> ravenzz: was hoping that I could do it similar to how I add an icon to a regular ui.button .button({icons:{primary: 'ui-icon-disk'}})
[12:55:12] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: Thank you, very much appreciated :)
[12:55:20] <Cork[home]> larzen-wrk: it checks if it exists, ex through a class on the element
[12:55:29] <djQuery> ravenzz: through css there is no way to disinuich wich button to set the image on
[12:55:32] <sadmicrowave> duttons, do you have a function started?
[12:55:35] <eddiemonge> Sean-Der: dont do eval. parseInt is much better cc austen
[12:55:42] <larzen-wrk> larzen-wrk: Cork - so I should implement that in my control - correct?
[12:55:47] <phlp> djQuery: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2525524
[12:55:50] <austen> eddiemonge: thanks. :)
[12:55:58] <Cork[home]> larzen-wrk: exactly
[12:55:59] <kborchers> djQuery: you should be able to append a span to the button with the ui-icon and ui-icon-...  i'm not sure if the icon option is doable but let me try to fiddle it up
[12:56:47] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: I know I will need to add a class on hover and then will need to add an another image src or add a url to surround the current big image..
[12:57:19] <plug918> is there a way to print out a list of attributes that belongs to an element?
[12:57:59] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: The problem is i am trying to make a plugin work with another plugin.. and need to figure a way to mess around with it to get it to suit..  I know this would be a 5 min job for someone with a good eye..
[12:58:05] <sadmicrowave> duttons, instead of trying to append or add another url on hover, can you just add the wrapper when the image loads?
[12:58:23] <Eviltwin> It'd be nice if we could field these questions one at a time
[12:58:40] <Eviltwin> I've seen some channels with a +m and a rotating +v
[12:58:40] <ajpiano> larzen-wrk: jquery ui components check for the existence of an instance inside of the jquery data cache and doesn't re-instantiate if if finds an instance already.
[12:58:50] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, you should make a #jquery helpdesk queue
[12:58:59] <soule> I've never taken a programming course in my life - i think it shows
[12:58:59] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: have you looked at how the cloud-zoom plugin works.. ?
[12:59:00] <jbrokc> how do i search for selectors within a document object? as in, `foo` is a Document object and I want to get the "<bar>" selector out of it
[12:59:01] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: I have no authority here
[12:59:18] <jbrokc> but it's not THE Document..
[12:59:24] <sadmicrowave> :(
[12:59:29] <djQuery> kborchers: k lookin at the way that they are doing it with this method.    buttons: [[text: 'Close', click: fucntion(){}, icons: {primary: 'ui-icon-close'}]
[12:59:43] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: i don't see us moving to that model
[13:00:09] <sadmicrowave> duttons, no
[13:00:19] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: it looks for a rel:  so I guess I need to add a class and rel to the image wrapper when its hovered over..
[13:00:32] <sadmicrowave> sounds like a start
[13:00:45] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: That's probably not the right model but it'd be nice if there were some way to fork off one issue and the people interested in helping with that issue into another channel
[13:00:49] <Eviltwin> Something simple
[13:01:15] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: the plugin looks really simple to use standalone.. but I am just not sure how to integrate it with the other plugin..
[13:01:27] <sadmicrowave> duttons, what other plugin are you referring to?
[13:02:03] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: jquerygallery.js.
[13:02:31] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: i see what you're getting at, but it ends up becoming difficult overhead
[13:02:50] <sadmicrowave> duttons, I have to go to a meeting
[13:02:53] <ajpiano> irc is pretty stateless and the supply and demand of helpers and helpees ebbs and flows constantly
[13:02:54] <Eviltwin> Aware but annoying that conversations are constantly running into each other
[13:03:09] <sadmicrowave> maybe someone else can help you out
[13:03:11] <Eviltwin> jbrokc: $("bar",foo)
[13:03:20] <ajpiano> it is what it is - a client that colours the individual nicks so you can tell people apart really helps me
[13:03:25] <Eviltwin> All <bar> tags in document foo
[13:03:26] <Eviltwin> Should work
[13:03:27] <soule> yeah
[13:03:27] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: sorry...   do you know of anyone on here that would be good at this kind of thing?
[13:03:42] <sadmicrowave> nope...if someone can help, they will
[13:03:46] <soule> All my client does is highlight me red and other people yellow
[13:04:05] <soule> What does ASYNC: False do?
[13:04:24] <duttons> <sadmicrowave>: sorry...   thanks for advising on the tidy up on my attrs
[13:04:30] <Eviltwin> soule: Makes the AJAX happen syncronously. Without it, the success will fire after the $.ajax call returns
[13:04:44] <Eviltwin> $.ajax("url
[13:04:46] <Eviltwin> Err
[13:04:55] <eddiemonge> soule: with it, it will lock up the browser until the request is done
[13:04:55] <Eviltwin> Let me actually type this up first
[13:04:59] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: if you stick around though, you end up getting the knack for following the chaos ... and i hope you do :)
[13:05:15] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: Just the JavaScript, actually
[13:05:24] <soule> I would stick around to help but i'm a total noob
[13:06:03] <phlp> soule: you can learn a lot from other people's answers though
[13:06:19] <soule> yeah
[13:06:29] <Eviltwin> I came in here with one somewhat involved question that no one was able to answer
[13:06:37] <Eviltwin> But realize I actually could contribute a lot here
[13:06:43] <Eviltwin> So I stuck around
[13:06:51] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: same thing happened to me a couple of years ago
[13:06:52] <Eviltwin> Although I suck at checking my IRC
[13:07:04] <soule> jquery is pretty cool
[13:07:11] <soule> but whats the difference between mootools and this?
[13:07:20] <soule> like, which is easier and which is more powerful?
[13:07:21] <Eviltwin> soule: From what I hear, speed mostly
[13:07:25] <soule> o
[13:07:30] <soule> mootools faster right?
[13:07:31] <ajpiano> i had a horriblly morose involved problem that no one could help with, but i ended up just sticking around, trying to answer questions as people asked and then i learned like, everything i know
[13:07:46] <ajpiano> soule: they have pretyyyyyyyyyyyy different philosophies
[13:08:10] <soule> I like jquery since its easy to pick up and not too different from traditional javascript/php
[13:08:12] <kborchers> ajpiano: great yayquery today!
[13:08:20] <ajpiano> thanks kborchers :)
[13:08:53] <soule> you do podcasts?
[13:08:56] <kborchers> although not quite as good as the ones over the last 3 months ;)
[13:09:00] <soule> (i just googled yayquery)
[13:09:11] <ajpiano> yes
[13:09:14] <soule> kool
[13:09:33] <Iarfen> hi
[13:09:38] <soule> i think IRC is better than Stack overflow
[13:09:39] <ajpiano> that podcast evolved out of this channel
[13:09:39] <soule> sometimes
[13:09:43] <soule> wow
[13:09:55] <Iarfen> How i can make that jquery executes a function when there is a given time (in minutes) of inactivity??
[13:10:10] <Eviltwin> Iarfen: You need to define inactivity
[13:10:30] <soule> sleep function?
[13:10:36] <soule> i think its called delay
[13:10:41] <ravenzz> ?setTimeout
[13:10:41] <bot-t> var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[13:10:53] <ajpiano> ?g jquery idleTimer @ larfen
[13:10:55] <bot-t> larfen, jQuery idleTimer plugin  Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2009/jquery-idletimer-plugin/
[13:10:56] <soule> oh
[13:11:06] <soule> what does bot-t do?
[13:11:09] <gho5t> i need to create a config file and i'm working with some js gurus and i...am not. do i need to do something other than just create a foo.config.js file that contains some initialized variables? like wrap them in anonymous function, use closures, or something fancy like that?
[13:11:21] <ravenzz> soule dirty stuffs
[13:11:22] <ajpiano> maintains order
[13:11:27] <ajpiano> and saves some typing
[13:11:31] <soule> cool
[13:11:50] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: Inactivity is when the user doesn't do anything in the webpage
[13:12:03] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: it doesn't click on a link, etc... the page is intact
[13:13:21] <soule> oh
[13:13:28] <soule> thats kind of complicated
[13:13:32] <Eviltwin> Iarfen: What about mouse moving within the page?
[13:13:39] <soule> http://paulirish.com/2009/jquery-idletimer-plugin/
[13:13:42] <Eviltwin> Or other JavaScript actions in the page
[13:13:42] <soule> that seems to do it
[13:13:45] <soule> like bot t said
[13:14:21] <soule> so u can say like
[13:14:33] <soule> after 5 minutes, put an alert
[13:14:50] <Eviltwin> I advise against an alert as it's a blocking operation
[13:14:55] <soule> or whatever
[13:14:58] <soule> just an example
[13:15:11] <Iarfen> Eviltwin: if the user clicks on an ajax it ins't inactivity
[13:15:12] <soule> but what are alternatives then
[13:15:12] <Eviltwin> For example you couldn't do like after 5 minutes alert, after 7 minutes redirect to the signin page etc.
[13:15:20] <soule> o
[13:15:21] <soule> ok
[13:15:29] <soule> yeah
[13:15:34] <Eviltwin> Because once it hits that alert statement, JavaScript just stops
[13:15:35] <soule> sign out after 5 mins
[13:15:39] <soule> ohh
[13:15:39] <Eviltwin> Same with prompt and all that stuff
[13:15:58] <soule> well thank you for helping me
[13:16:01] <Eviltwin> The only way for the JavaScript to get control back is for the alert to be dismissed by the user
[13:16:02] <soule> my issue was very simple after all
[13:16:05] <soule> :P
[13:16:22] <soule> I try not to use alerts too much
[13:16:27] <soule> just
[13:16:31] <Eviltwin> It helps if you start with the general problem rather than the specific
[13:16:41] <soule> yeah
[13:16:44] <soule> next time
[13:16:44] <soule> :P
[13:16:48] <soule> sorry to waste ur time tho
[13:16:53] <soule> and others'
[13:18:20] <eddiemonge> soule: console.log => it should be your best friend
[13:18:28] <soule> whats console.log
[13:18:37] <soule> I currently use alerts to debug
[13:18:38] <djQuery> well I found where ui.dialog would need to be editied to be able to pass ui.button options to the _createButtons at least
[13:18:43] <soule> I'm used to print based debuggin
[13:18:45] <soule> old school
[13:18:46] <kborchers> djQuery: it's an ugly hack but it was the only way i found to do it a while back when i wanted a print icon on a dialog button http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/bMEeL/

[13:19:15] <soule> thanks ill read that
[13:19:40] <eddiemonge> soule: thanks ajpiano. hes the evil genius behind it
[13:19:57] <Merrick> hey everyone, is there a good browser plugin that would allow me to see what event listeners are on an element i select?
[13:20:07] <soule> I dont see why helping people is evil :P
[13:20:12] <soule> FIREBUG
[13:20:12] <ravenzz> djQuery what's wrong with a background-image?
[13:20:14] <eddiemonge> Merrick: firequery for firebug
[13:20:22] <soule> I am so new
[13:20:33] <Merrick> (y)
[13:20:42] <ajpiano> ?g visual event alan jardine @ Merrick
[13:20:43] <bot-t> Merrick, Allan Jardine | Reflections | Visual Event - http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event
[13:20:45] <djQuery> ravenzz: what happens when I want a different icon for each of the buttons?
[13:20:48] <soule> gonna install that
[13:21:22] <Merrick> piano, i saw that but was having trouble getting it into my bookmark bar.
[13:21:46] <soule> wow
[13:21:53] <soule> it is so true i learn by sticking around
[13:21:53] <soule> :D
[13:22:03] <ravenzz> djQuery how did u figured out that issue?
[13:22:31] <Merrick> i may have a plugin/extension installed that has the bookmark bar locked.  i do like though how it shows the code.  eddie, does that tool you gave show the jquery code too like visual event does
[13:22:34] <ravenzz> contains() ?
[13:22:40] <soule> Have any of u used jquery lint?
[13:23:06] <Merrick> no
[13:23:44] <djQuery> ravenzz: figure out what? where it would need to be editied to allow passing options to the .button call?
[13:23:47] <eddiemonge> soule: yeah. i didnt like it too much
[13:23:50] <djQuery> in the source.
[13:23:53] <soule> whats it do?
[13:23:57] <Merrick> <checking firequery>
[13:23:59] <soule> Is it really helpful?
[13:24:00] <eddiemonge> Merrick: i think it does
[13:24:02] <soule> Im downloading it
[13:24:04] <eddiemonge> ?tias @ Merrick
[13:24:05] <bot-t> Merrick, Try It And See
[13:24:12] <soule> wow
[13:24:14] <soule> Bot is smart
[13:24:19] <soule> ?tias @ soule
[13:24:19] <bot-t> soule, Try It And See
[13:24:23] <soule> :P
[13:24:43] <Merrick> installed, not seeing where it put it though lol
[13:24:56] <soule> ttheres an example page
[13:25:06] <eddiemonge> Merrick: examine it and it should show an object next to the element
[13:25:19] <djQuery> ravenzz: line 9259 of jqueryui.js would need to be modified to check to see if props.buttonoptions is valid and passit to the button.button() call
[13:26:08] <soule> Oh my god
[13:26:11] <djQuery> kborchers: ^^
[13:26:19] <soule> If i knew firebug worked for jquery
[13:26:19] <soule> d
[13:26:22] <soule> damn
[13:26:22] <soule> :(
[13:26:35] <soule> I could have saved atleast 3 hours
[13:26:41] <Merrick> i know soule!  i just found out about the fireCookie
[13:26:59] <soule> fire query fire bug fire cookie
[13:27:01] <soule> what next
[13:27:01] <soule> f
[13:27:03] <soule> fire brownie
[13:27:05] <soule> fire cow
[13:27:29] <larzen-wrk> i have a silly question! So I wrote my jq component, but I don't know how to execute functions from externally (from outside of the component through the use of ($('.someDiv').floorPlans.myfunction! or whatever... whe I check in figrebug i see ___proto___ and all my functions are under there... any help?
[13:27:51] <Merrick> damn, doesn't show the code though.
[13:28:45] <nascro> How do I get the index ($i) to be only relevant to the current .projects and not the others? Clicking on a state and navigating through divs, closing, and doing the same on another state seems to leave off with where the last .projects was. http://jsfiddle.net/nascro/A5Vj4/
[13:28:45] <bot-t> (4 hours 16 mins ago) <sadmicrowave> tell nascro: I got all the states done. http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/EXyhm/10/
[13:28:49] <kborchers> djQuery: i don't modify the source. i work around it and if it won't do what you want and if it really bothers you, you can always change it and submit a pull request ;) https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[13:29:31] <nascro> @kborchers my question relevant to our discussion yesterday.
[13:29:56] <nascro> @kborchers it has to be a similar situation since it's essential the same problem on a smaller scale
[13:30:05] <nascro> @kborchers re: this/that
[13:30:05] <kborchers> nascro: yeah, let me look
[13:30:09] <larzen-wrk> $(tabIdSelector).floorplans().moveTo is not a function          <-- but it is a function!
[13:30:52] <daninma> @ajpiano damn, http://fixingthesejquery.com/ is some excellent work. thanks for taking the time
[13:31:13] <djQuery> kborchers: do you like this any better http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/bMEeL/1/
[13:31:40] <djQuery> kborchers: that's what I was meaning to do.
[13:32:14] <larzen-wrk> i have this method defined within my plugin: moveTo: function (x, y) {  .. } how do I execute it from outside fo the plugin code? Any help?
[13:32:36] <kborchers> djQuery: that's much better ... that's what i wanted to do and never figured it out about 2 years ago when i originally wrote that ... nice. would be nice to include that in that option in the source though
[13:32:45] <ajpiano> daninma :))
[13:35:37] <kborchers> nascro: your map is broken so i can't test ... can you fix it?
[13:35:59] <nascro> @kborchers yep, my bad
[13:36:06] <kborchers> need to include masonry in resources i think
[13:36:57] <nascro> @kborchers should work: http://jsfiddle.net/nascro/A5Vj4/1/
[13:39:12] <kborchers> nascro: this should do it. it does remember where it left off for each state but one state doesn't effect another http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/A5Vj4/2/
[13:40:54] <nascro> What change did you make? Did you just make the $i declaration global?
[13:41:00] <duttons> how do I add a class to this ?  or where...     $('#thumbsContainer img').live('click',function(){ 		loadPhoto($(this),''); 	}).live('mouseover',function(){ 		var $this   = $(this); 		$this.stop().animate({'opacity':'1.0'},200); 	}).live('mouseout',function(){ 		 var $this   = $(this); 		$this.stop().animate({'opacity':'0.4'},200); 	}); 	 	$(window).bind('resize', function() { 		resize($('#displayed'),0); 	});
[13:41:02] <nascro> @kborchers ^^
[13:41:17] <kborchers> duttons: don't paste code here
[13:41:27] <duttons> oops sorry..
[13:41:29] <Merrick> ooo, visual event is the winner.
[13:41:29] <kborchers> nascro: yes
[13:42:25] <kborchers> nascro: without doing that, your $i=0 in the 2 click handlers didn't do anything
[13:43:18] <larzen-wrk> can anyone point me to a working example where "methods" is used to capture plugin functionality?
[13:43:30] <kborchers> nascro: there is probably a better way to go about that without a global but with your current code, that was the easiest fix
[13:43:49] <nascro> @kborchers yeah, I am sure my code isn't at its finest
[13:44:51] <wesada> Hi folks.
[13:46:08] <wesada> I have a table that pulls in JSON via an AJAX call and I'm wondering how I can apply my JQuery UI button functions to the elements from the call?
[13:47:11] <djQuery> kborchers: think this will work? http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/bMEeL/3/
[13:47:23] <nascro> @kborchers that fixes the problem, but creates another problem. Now the prev/next buttons don't know where it's at in the index...
[13:47:26] <djQuery> cant figure out why its not calling dialog
[13:47:36] <rosco_y> wesada: I wish I could see how you're pulling your JSON data.  I'm trying to feed JSON data to jsTree, and I'm way over my head
[13:47:48] <djQuery> probably somethign to do with the order that jsfiddle puts stuff in there.
[13:47:51] <nascro> What's the standard way to navigate through an index, anyway?
[13:48:02] <rosco_y> I feel like I'm either inches away or miles, and I can't tell the difference
[13:48:22] <wesada> rosco_y: What's your platform? PHP, Ruby, Python?
[13:48:52] <kborchers> yeah, you have to include each piece of UI through resources
[13:48:57] <kborchers> djQuery ^^
[13:49:17] <nascro> .index()?
[13:49:51] <djQuery> kborchers: or at least everything that dialog relies on. give me a sec.
[13:50:16] <kborchers> djQuery: exactly ... i do that all the time
[13:50:21] <djQuery>  which is a lot
[13:50:28] <kborchers> yep
[13:51:02] <ahrengot> Hey, can someone help me figure out how to fetch data stored in the HTML5 data attribute.
[13:51:32] <ahrengot> i have this markup <img src="blah.jpg" data-large-src="blah2.jpg" />
[13:51:57] <eddiemonge> $('img').data('large-src')
[13:52:06] <eddiemonge> ?data @ ahrengot
[13:52:07] <bot-t> ahrengot, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:52:14] <ahrengot> but $('element').attr('data-large-src') returns undefined. As do $('element').data('large-src');
[13:52:14] <wesada> rosco_y: http://www.jstree.com/documentation/json_data
[13:52:18] <rosco_y> wesada: sorry, I'm using ASP.NET MVC on Linux
[13:52:30] <rosco_y> Got caught up in a chess game
[13:52:47] <rosco_y> I'm getting the snot beat out of me
[13:52:51] <wesada> rosco_y: Take a look at the AJAX demo at the link I just posted from the JsTree docs.
[13:53:06] <Eviltwin> artur: Try .data('largeSrc')
[13:53:11] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[13:53:14] <rosco_y> wesada: :) that's what I've been working off of
[13:53:21] <Eviltwin> ahrengot: Try .data('largeSrc')
[13:53:32] <wesada> rosco_y: What's the difficulty?
[13:54:08] <rosco_y> How about if I paste it up, I don't really know what my difficulty is---it isn't working, that's for sure
[13:54:35] <kborchers> nascro: i think you need to think through those if statements in your arrow click handlers i messed with them a little and got them working but still not exactly what you need http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/A5Vj4/3/
[13:54:59] <djQuery> kborchers: getting closer http://jsbin.com/ebowan/2/edit
[13:55:18] <djQuery> kborchers: err rather http://jsbin.com/ebowan/3/edit
[13:55:37] <rosco_y> wesada: here's a paste of my feeble attempt to use the example code that you referred to: http://paste2.org/p/1559302
[13:55:48] <ahrengot> Arh stupid me. I was reading the data off the wrong element.
[13:56:07] <ahrengot> .data('large-src') works just fine
[13:56:49] <ahrengot> as do .attr('data-large-src');
[13:57:09] <rosco_y> The Html.Encode(ViewData["JSON"]) %> literally spits my JSON data onto the page, and that's all I see on my generated web page
[13:57:29] <Eviltwin> adnasa: Was going to suggest that next
[13:57:43] <phlp> rosco_y: why did you end the script tag right before that?
[13:57:49] <adnasa> what?
[13:57:52] <djQuery> kborchers: hey its working now. http://jsbin.com/ebowan/4/edit    now to jsut make a pull request.
[13:58:15] <adnasa> Eviltwin: what are you talking about? just logged in.
[13:58:15] <kborchers> djQuery: what all did you change?
[13:58:24] <wesada> rosco_y: Try this.
[13:58:35] <wesada> rosco_y: Oops. :)  http://www.nayyeri.net/using-jsonresult-in-asp-net-mvc-ajax
[13:58:59] <Eviltwin> adnasa: Sorry bad tab complete
[13:59:01] <rosco_y> phlp: thanks, mostly because I just don't know what I'm doing
[13:59:02] <Eviltwin> Guy left
[13:59:21] <adnasa> Eviltwin: okay..
[13:59:38] <rosco_y> but the <%=Html.Encode(blah blah)%> isn't javascript anymore
[13:59:39] <djQuery> not much at all  changed  button.button(); to  button.button(props.btnOptions || {});
[14:00:05] <rosco_y> wesada: Thanks!  This link looks like just the thing I've been looking for!!
[14:00:13] <djQuery> kborchers: ^^^^^
[14:00:31] <phlp> rosco_y: the <%= %> is taken care of on the server.. by the time it gets to the browser to handle the script tag it will be json
[14:00:38] <wesada> rosco_y: Just remember you need to pass a properly built JSON object to JSTree when using the JSON data plugin.
[14:00:48] <djQuery> kborchers: but for it to work you have to pass the buttons in as an array I believe.
[14:01:03] <Eviltwin> Not really sure why there's a closing script tag and another opening one...
[14:01:08] <Foxandxss> hi there, anyone knows if html5 contenteditable have a event to listen? I control the blur event in jquery but the element is the old one and not the edited one :P
[14:02:25] <kborchers> djQuery: hmmm, why doesn't it work as an object?
[14:02:29] <rosco_y> wesada: Thank you, I am finding that jsTree requires a custom formatted jsTree JSON format, so I wrote my own JSON serializer
[14:03:13] <wesada> rosco_y: ???
[14:03:43] <rosco_y> wesada: :) I expected that....I'll paste my JSON that I came up with
[14:04:02] <drOptimize> I'm having trouble using a selector to find some dynamic object built by another plugin...
[14:04:47] <drOptimize> the plugin creates some objects an appends them to a div. these have a class i can look them up by... but It doesn't seem to be working...
[14:05:22] <rosco_y> wesada: here is my generated JSON:  http://paste2.org/p/1559320
[14:05:41] <chubz24469> hey i have a simple question, i'm trying to clone a div. this is what i have so far. http://jsfiddle.net/XBG2S/ it copies the div but not some of its properties. what am i doing wrong
[14:05:47] <rosco_y> Next I'll paste a link to the documentation that led me to this decision
[14:06:19] <drOptimize> selecting dynamic objects from another plugin: http://pastebin.com/bg04Dfur
[14:06:42] <djQuery> kborchers: because of an if statement earlier in the code
[14:07:19] <endurans>  ui 1.8.14 and jquery. 1.5.1 - trying tabs on a local machine (not file open but a server at  localhost) makes the tabs to re-load the page also inside each panel, it's a know bug?
[14:07:22] <djQuery> kborchers: now to go read the docs on how to make a pull request
[14:07:44] <kborchers> djQuery: if it doesn't work as an object, i have a feeling it will be declined :(
[14:07:53] <rosco_y> Well, it's the same link you shared with me: http://www.jstree.com/documentation/json_data
[14:07:53] <wesada> rosco_y: http://jsonlint.com/
[14:08:11] <wesada> rosco_y: You don't have valid JSON.
[14:08:53] <gym_jane_> hi all
[14:08:53] <rosco_y> wesada: :) I expected that too--the "json_data":{} can go, first off
[14:09:03] <gym_jane_> can someone please explain this code? http://pastebin.com/4uJyW3GF
[14:09:07] <kborchers> djQuery: it works as an object ... you just have to do it right ;) http://jsbin.com/ebowan/6/edit
[14:09:11] <gym_jane_> its making me very curious
[14:09:29] <djQuery> kborchers: props = $.isFunction( props ) ? { click: props, text: name } : props;
[14:09:43] <rosco_y> I thought I'd never get it write the first time, so I  wanted to continue with feeding to jsTree, so I could see what effects changes to my parsing code have on the tree
[14:09:55] <djQuery> kborchers: coool
[14:09:55] <discovering_Sf2> salve
[14:10:28] <kborchers> djQuery: you know git?
[14:10:34] <rosco_y> Right off the bat I suspected that "json_data" : {}  is not valid, but it's easy to remove, I've been telling myself
[14:10:41] <gym_jane_> anyone?
[14:10:56] <djQuery> kborchers: not realy but there is a doc explaining how to do it purely in github somewhere.
[14:11:27] <chubz24469> hey i have a simple question, i'm trying to clone a div. this is what i have so far. http://jsfiddle.net/XBG2S/ it copies the div but not some of its properties. what am i doing wrong
[14:11:33] <rosco_y> gym_jane_: I'm looking, but I'm trying to figure out this stuff too, so I can't actually help :(
[14:11:41] <discovering_Sf2> i'm having the problem that an onchange event of an input field is triggered _after_ clicking the submit button, is there a way to avoid this?
[14:11:45] <rosco_y> unless you just need a hanky to blow your nose in
[14:11:52] <kborchers> djQuery: no better time to learn than the present ... jQuery UI is what made me learn git and now I contribute all the time ... even got my name listed as a contributor :)
[14:12:11] <Jayflux> kborchers ive never fully understood ui
[14:12:25] <kborchers> Jayflux: what do you mean?
[14:12:40] <rosco_y> it kind of looks like it is pushing a State onto a stack, as soon as the web page is completely loaded ?
[14:12:42] <djQuery> kborchers: think button.button((props.btnOptions===undefined)?{}: props.btnOptions); is safer than button.button(props.btnOptions || {});
[14:13:11] <rosco_y> presumably so the state can be restored at some future time?
[14:13:16] <Jayflux> kborchers well i just use the normal jquery in my site, not used the ui stuff
[14:13:23] <djQuery> kborchers: and do you think that btnOptions is a good name for the var"?
[14:13:44] <glaksmono> guys when we do $(window).height() within an iframe, it's the height of the iframe right?
[14:14:04] <rosco_y> djQuery: a good name is any name that will be obvious to anyone who looks at it in the future
[14:14:10] <chubz24469> hey i have a simple question, i'm trying to clone a div. this is what i have so far. http://jsfiddle.net/XBG2S/ it copies the div but not some of its properties. what am i doing wrong
[14:14:23] <kborchers> djQuery: i think your first way is fine ... i would maybe spell out buttonOptions. what ever they don't like, they'll let you know and have you fix it before it gets in ;)
[14:14:47] <rosco_y> wesada: thanks for the jsonlint link--I don't know about that one
[14:14:54] <Dr4g> my $.post() isn't sending back POST data to my PHP script Outputting the post contents at the PHP end, it is empty. Here is the code.  http://pastebin.com/jjKTpgJ8
[14:14:55] <Dr4g> -
[14:15:15] <glaksmono> when we do $(window).height() within an iframe, it's the iframe's height right?
[14:15:32] <drOptimize> Cheap Viagra: http://ow.ly/5TyFt
[14:15:40] <kborchers> Jayflux: UI is for UI stuff ;) So if you need an accordion or a dialog or a button or you want something to be draggable or resizable, UI does that grunt work for you
[14:15:44] <Dr4g> Sorry, got it working guys.. missing # in my selector
[14:15:56] <wesada> rosco_y: Have you got a working demo?
[14:16:15] <Jayflux> kborchers i will have to play around with it, only used jQuery itself. Is UI just plugins then?
[14:16:20] <rosco_y> wesada: no, sadly I'm way back at the beginning
[14:16:44] <rosco_y> I'm pulling my data from my database into an object tree, and I'm trying to feed that jsTree
[14:16:56] <opie_> Jayflux: i'd say it's a collection of plug-ins to the extent that it's really a javascript control framework
[14:16:57] <orolo> chubz24469: http://jsfiddle.net/XBG2S/1/. i'm not quite sure if this is what you are looking for.
[14:17:05] <kborchers> Jayflux: i think a number of the UI widgets started out as jquery plugins, yes and are now just housed and maintained in a single repository
[14:17:24] <rosco_y> at this point, it might just be easier to use the HTML model, which uses the unordered list (I think)
[14:17:29] <Jayflux> ic
[14:18:05] <rosco_y> but my son recommended I use JSON.  Unfortunately he's in the Air Force, and I only catch him for bits and pieces
[14:18:37] <zoned> i have a text field (input type=text), how do i set the value of it with jquery? $('#inputId').text('something'); doesn't work :/
[14:19:01] <wesada> rosco_y: Take a look at the JSON data that comes back when you load nodes on the JSTree demo page.
[14:19:13] <wesada> That's the format your data needs to follow.
[14:19:15] <phlp> zoned: .val('something')
[14:19:28] <rosco_y> wesada: I don't know how to do that
[14:19:34] <zoned> rosco_y: in your php, do this: while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
[14:19:34] <zoned> 	foreach($row as $key => $value) {
[14:19:35] <zoned> 		$arr[$key] = $value;
[14:19:35] <zoned> 	}
[14:19:35] <zoned> 	$main_arr[] = $arr;
[14:19:35] <zoned> }
[14:19:47] <zoned> rosco_y: then $json = json_encode($main_arr);
[14:19:47] <zoned> echo $json;
[14:19:55] <gnarf> zoned: don't paste that many lines of text into a public irc channel
[14:19:56] <snover> zoned: please do not paste code in the channel.
[14:20:00] <gnarf> use a pastebin
[14:20:06] <wesada> zoned: He's on ASP.NET
[14:20:13] <zoned> nevermind.
[14:20:14] <rosco_y> zoned: thank you...sometimes I wish I was using php, that's also what my son recommended
[14:20:33] <discovering_Sf2> i'm having the problem that an onchange event of an input field is triggered _after_ clicking the submit button. is there a way to fix this?
[14:20:43] <zoned> i just spent a long time trying to figure out how to do that, i assumed you were using php so i thought i'd help ya out. guess i didn't. lol.
[14:20:53] <wesada> rosco_y: Nothing wrong with the ASP.Net, you just need to get the JSON into JSON format that JSTree expects.
[14:21:10] <rosco_y> wesada: which option at http://www.jstree.com/documentation/html_data do you recommend I model?
[14:21:11] <glaksmono> when we do $(window).height() within an iframe, it's the iframe's height right?
[14:21:12] <wesada> JSTree expects an object with arrays of data nodes.
[14:21:18] <glaksmono> guys, when we do $(window).height() within an iframe, it's the iframe's height right?
[14:22:01] <chubz24469> orolo: thats what i did pretty much, i would get the basic part of the panel, but i wouldn't get the title, icons, collapsable properties
[14:22:43] <Jayflux> glaksmono no
[14:22:44] <rosco_y> wesada: can I somehow view the JSON data they are using in the jsTree documentation's demos?
[14:22:55] <Jayflux> as window is the browser viewport and not the iframe itself
[14:23:13] <wesada> rosco_y: Do you use Chrome or Firefox with Firebug?
[14:23:25] <rosco_y> I have Firefox with Firebug
[14:24:04] <phlp> rosco_y: the json you pasted earlier was not valid. use this http://jsonlint.com
[14:24:31] <wesada> rosco_y: This is from JSTree demo. http://jsfiddle.net/wesada/PhSTR/1/
[14:24:34] <rosco_y> phlp: thank you, and yes my JSON has serious problems :(((
[14:25:28] <rosco_y> wesada: so is everything between the [ and the ], JSON data?
[14:26:19] <wesada> rosco_y: JSTree expects a JSON array of objects. So yes, that designates an array.
[14:27:07] * rosco_y is trying to think but nothing is happening
[14:27:54] <rosco_y> Is it possible to link to jsTree (on the web) in jsFiddle, and run the examples that way?
[14:28:09] <rosco_y> like in the "add resources"?
[14:28:25] <orolo> chubz24469: you can try setting [widhDataAndEvents] to true.
[14:28:29] <orolo> ?clone
[14:28:29] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[14:28:31] <glaksmono> can someone answer me please? :(
[14:28:32] <glaksmono> guys, when we do $(window).height() within an iframe, it's the iframe's height right?
[14:29:04] <kborchers> glaksmono: why don't you just try it
[14:29:22] <rosco_y> glaksmono: can you verify that by trial and error?
[14:29:38] <rosco_y> make a big frame, check the height, make a small frame, check the height
[14:29:48] <rosco_y> I'd tell you the answer, if I knew
[14:30:00] <zoned> phlp: thanks
[14:30:50] * djQuery grrrr ui bug login messed up
[14:30:50] <rosco_y> I can do this :)
[14:31:34] <djQuery> glaksmono: give it a try
[14:31:40] <krambiorix> hi guys, this doesn't work: $(id).fadeOut('slow', function() { }); what could be the problem?
[14:31:42] <zoned> i have a .click function defined for an element, how can i call this from somewhere else in the code (without the user actually clicking that is)
[14:31:46] <rosco_y> Thanks wesada, phlp, zoned, et. al....
[14:31:57] <rosco_y> Sure hope I can somehow repay the favor someday
[14:32:13] <kborchers> djQuery: you're not trying to file a bug for that are you? It's not really a bug, just a left out feature. Just submit the PR.
[14:32:13] <rubyruy> when one calls .stop() on an element to kill an animation, is there an automatic way to also reset whatever css the animation was messing with?
[14:32:24] <rubyruy> one would assume .stop(true, true).... but doesn't seem to have done it
[14:32:44] <djQuery> kborchers: cool didnt know the correct format.
[14:32:58] <gnarf> rubyruy: what kinda of animation?
[14:33:13] <phlp> zoned: $('#foo').click()
[14:33:14] <rubyruy> bounce
[14:33:17] <gnarf> stop(true, true) should set it to the "final" point of the current running animation, and then also clear the queue
[14:33:25] <kborchers> rubyruy: true, true would jump to the end putting the css at it's end state of the animation not the beginning
[14:33:33] <kborchers> gnarf: get out of my head
[14:33:45] <gnarf> rubyruy: bounce is implemented as a bunch of individual animations in a queue
[14:33:46] <rubyruy> but normally when an animation finished the css is reset
[14:34:01] <rubyruy> to whatever it used to be
[14:34:04] <kborchers> gotta go ... later all
[14:34:06] <kegi> Hi all, I am having a problem with autocomplete, not sure why this isnt populating results like I was hoping http://jsfiddle.net/kegimaro/BeHHA/
[14:34:15] <rubyruy> er so stop() only kills a single "swing" ?
[14:34:21] <gnarf> rubyruy: the end of the bounce effect will do that too, the problem is, it never plays the last swing
[14:35:07] <rubyruy> is that an afirmative on my last question?
[14:35:30] <krambiorix> hi guys, this doesn't work: $(id).fadeOut('slow', function() { }); what could be the problem?
[14:35:57] <gnarf> yes
[14:36:09] <rubyruy> wellies
[14:36:10] <phlp> krambiorix: maybe $('#' + id) ?
[14:36:11] <gnarf> I'm also looking into a way to stop that for 1.9
[14:36:26] <gnarf> jQuery 1.7 + UI 1.9 can probably make .stop() actually stop the ui effect too
[14:38:02] <krambiorix> phlp nope
[14:38:19] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here work with jquery templates much?
[14:41:45] <ProLoser|Work> is there a comprehensive tutorial to the jquery templating?
[14:42:35] <phlp> http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates
[14:42:47] <wesada> ProLoser|Work: Does this help any? http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-an-introduction-to-jquery-templating/
[14:44:17] <wesada> ProLoser|Work: This may also help. http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/fun-with-jquery-templating-and-ajax/
[14:44:40] <discovering_Sf2> i use the ui.combobox and have the problem that the change event of the input field's autocompleter is triggered _after_ clicking the form's submit button. is there a way to fix this?
[14:45:37] <drOptimize> I seem to having an issue selecting dynamic objects with jquery. i'm creating objects and appending them to a div. then when i try to select them later, nothing happens... http://ow.ly/5TyFt
[14:46:28] <chubz24469> what am i doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/DSDx9/ i'm trying to recreate the same div element 10 times but its not working
[14:46:42] <austinbv> are you sure your selector is correct?
[14:47:15] <ProLoser|Work> wesada: the video looks dated?
[14:47:20] <austinbv> drOptimize: you need to make sure that the second script runs after the tweet attaches everything to the dom
[14:47:20] <drOptimize> I'm assuming they are. they're simple
[14:47:36] <drOptimize> yeah, that would have been my 2nd question
[14:47:37] <wesada> ProLoser|Work: The second link is better.
[14:47:58] <drOptimize> they might not be there when I'm asking... how do you chain unrelated functions?
[14:48:09] <drOptimize> like some methods have a callback paramter.
[14:50:21] <austinbv> chubz24469: http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/DSDx9/1/
[14:51:44] <velts> has anyone ever used a js mvc framework?
[14:52:15] <velts> im trying to figure the best way to organzie my js for a large project
[14:52:39] <chubz24469> austinbv: hmm still didn't work
[14:53:18] <austinbv> chubz24469: working proof http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/DSDx9/2/
[14:53:22] <austinbv> what isn't working
[14:53:58] <chubz24469> here let me put up something easier to work with, its just not displaying the panel at all
[14:54:18] <austinbv> I have 10 equal divs in that jsfiddle
[14:54:21] <chubz24469> austinbv: http://jsfiddle.net/DSDx9/3/
[14:54:26] <chubz24469> hmm
[14:54:35] <austinbv> click the 2nd one
[14:54:39] <cook1es> I have a lastModified field retrieved from a JSON API, there's no documentation on what kind of timestamp it is, does anyone recognize the format? I tried UNIX timestamp, it's not. "lastModified":1311362443895
[14:54:40] <austinbv> or inspect the first
[14:54:40] <chubz24469> i basically want to copy that div
[14:54:50] <educr0w> I need an advice of a good practice. I'm doing a shopping cart, I have shoppingcart.php that can handle add items, remove items and get the list of items in the cart, If I am using ajax to add, remove and refresh list items, which is a good practice to return data to client?
[14:55:03] <chubz24469> oh hmmm. then i think somethings wrong with my div element
[14:57:08] <chubz24469> austinbv: how do i include the div properties into it? like the collapsible, minimizable stuff
[14:57:47] <zoned> can you bind a .change handler to a text input field? it doesn't seem to be working.
[14:58:28] <zoned> $('#foo').change(function() {alert($(this).val())); });
[14:59:24] <phlp> zoned: it wont fire the event until the input loses focus
[15:00:09] <zoned> hmm.. what if it never gets focus? i have something else on the page that changes its value
[15:01:01] <cypha> does someone have like 5 minutes to give me a little explanation of what's going on with a simple modal window?
[15:01:26] <drOptimize> how to wait for on jQuery func to be done? before starting the next?
[15:01:29] <zoned> cypha: show us what's up, you'll get yelled for "asking to ask" :P
[15:01:45] <drOptimize> unrelated target objects, so i figure I couldn't chain anything
[15:01:46] <zoned> phlp: is there any way to achieve what i want to do?
[15:01:57] <phlp> zoned: you can do .change() to trigger the event
[15:02:37] <cypha> zoned, cuz I keep getting 10 people responding and saying different stuff and it just confuses me =/
[15:02:48] <cypha> zoned: http://69.84.109.187:6543/login
[15:02:59] <acidjazz> whats hte best toolkit to make things like back-end admins that works w/ jquery today?
[15:03:01] <austinbv> you need to attach any events after the element is attached to the UI or use a the jquery ?live @ chubz24469
[15:03:09] <cypha> I was wondering how changing the <link class> will change stuff
[15:03:18] <austinbv> ?live @ chubz24469

[15:03:24] <draginx> Is jquery template out of beta and if not would it be reasonable to store a small string (e.g. "<div class="hello">{x}</div><div class="world">{y}</div>") and then doing a str.replace('{x}', json.data[x]} be reasonable?
[15:03:29] <cypha> and wondering how to make the "forgot password" link give a popup instead of the hello world "button"
[15:03:30] <draginx> I dont know if i need a full blown template system
[15:03:40] <austinbv> cypha: it depends oh what you have bound to that class
[15:03:56] <zoned> ^^
[15:04:05] <chubz24469> austinbv: thanks ill try that
[15:04:18] <austinbv> cypha: what have you tried
[15:05:30] <austinbv> chubz24469: the deal is you cannot attach events to an object before it exists
[15:06:37] <sbahra> Hi all.
[15:07:10] <chubz24469> austinbv: thanks again
[15:07:10] <sbahra> Newbie to Javascript and to flot, but is there an easy way to allow flot to buffer a larger range of data than it displays for the purposes of panning?
[15:08:22] <austinbv> sbahra: you mean a float variable?
[15:08:59] <austinbv> nevermind
[15:09:01] <sbahra> austinbv, well, what I'm doing is fetching a JSON every N seconds, the contents are updated with a timestamp-value pair.
[15:09:06] <sbahra> austen, I append this pair to the existing data set.
[15:09:31] <sbahra> austinbv, however, I'd like to be able to pan for N * 2...
[15:09:37] <sbahra> austinbv, but only display N points.
[15:09:46] <sbahra> (for example)
[15:09:57] <sbahra> I was hoping for a more convenient way than redrawing manually.
[15:09:58] <cypha> wtf
[15:10:03] <cypha> was there a netsplit?
[15:10:13] <cypha> i've been talking to my freaking self
[15:10:26] <zoned> cypha: you haven't said anything in awhile
[15:10:50] <cypha> geez
[15:10:53] <cypha> k, zoned
[15:11:07] <cypha> what's the purpose of giving a <link href of the css file a class attribute?
[15:11:10] <winux> is there a good way to select a specific div amongst a bunch of divs, each having the same class?
[15:11:52] <zoned> winux $(#parentDiv #nextDiv #nextDiv .divWithTheClass)
[15:12:04] <sbahra> austinbv, any ideas then?
[15:12:09] <winux> zoned: thanks
[15:12:17] <cypha> zoned, if I change the class, what would happen?
[15:12:21] <cypha> it seems to still work fine
[15:12:44] <zoned> cypha: css is just for styling, it won't change the functionality of your code. i don't think i understand the question

[15:13:07] <cypha> i have <link class="testjsbin" href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
[15:13:15] <cypha> what is the purpose of testjsbin
[15:13:38] <cypha> i was just going to point it to a local copy of that css file, but I wanted to know what that class had to do with anything
[15:14:12] <zoned> is class even a valid attribute of the link element? check w3schools
[15:15:21] <cypha> zoned, yes
[15:15:27] <cypha> specifies a classname for an element
[15:15:35] <zoned> cypha: i have no idea, i've never seen that before
[15:15:45] <cypha> zoned, so I can delete it safely
[15:15:47] <cypha> ?
[15:15:47] <zoned> it doesn't seem like it could do anything, to me
[15:15:52] <zoned> cypha: i believe so
[15:16:11] <zoned> safely.... lol what did you think was going to happen? :P
[15:16:18] <cypha> zoned, ok, so how would I make "forgot password" give the popup instead of the "hello world" button?
[15:16:18] <zoned> trial/error = learning :)
[15:16:23] <cypha> lmao
[15:16:26] <cypha> good point
[15:17:15] <zoned> well, for starters, forgot password is a link, and hello world is a button..
[15:17:32] <cypha> yeah, so is it very different?
[15:17:44] <zoned> you could copy the code from hello world, and rename 'hello world' to 'forgot password'
[15:17:45] <cypha> thought it would be even easier
[15:18:39] <zoned> oh, sorry, i misread what you said.
[15:19:10] <zoned> have you identified what code executes when you click the hello world button?
[15:19:20] <cypha> zoned: popup.js
[15:19:36] <cypha> i think
[15:19:45] <cypha> i'm not sure what "  <script type="text/javascript"> $('hello').click(function(){$('hello').dialog({modal: true}); }); </script>" means either, it's in my html file
[15:20:48] <zoned> if you don't understand what that code does, you should begin by reading some jquery/javascript tutorials/hello world examples..
[15:21:04] <glaksmono> djQuery, kborchers, rosco_y: well yeah, i did and it doesn't seem so, but i wanna double check
[15:22:04] <bronson> Saw a jquery plugin a few weeks ago that was a multiple-entry combobox.
[15:22:29] <bronson> i.e. I could enter "apples", "oranges", and "pears", and each would appear in the form as an individual item.
[15:22:34] <bronson> Click the X and the item is deleted.
[15:22:45] <bronson> Anyone know what this was?
[15:22:48] <cypha> zoned, why is 'hello' in there twice, for example
[15:22:59] <bronson> The google has failed me.
[15:23:09] <cypha> and secondly, are you saying that popup.js is not used?
[15:24:09] <zoned> $('hello') is a selector which selects the element 'hello'.    the stuff inside of the .click(function(){  defines what will happen when you click that (hello) element.     to achieve what you're trying to do, you need to select the forgot password element, and bind a .click handler to it, then inside that .click handler type whatever you want to happen when you click it.
[15:24:55] <zoned> that's about the best i can describe it without just doing it for you
[15:25:21] <zoned> now, go do some tutorials, read, and learn :) good luck my young padawan
[15:25:45] <cypha> thank you very much zoned
[15:26:12] <cypha> can you recommend a tutorial site that will show me js/jq while allowing me to actually put it to use on my site?
[15:26:22] <cypha> learn by doing sort of deal
[15:26:37] <bronson> Anyone have a suggestion for a multiple-entry combobox widget?
[15:26:51] <zoned> http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[15:26:53] <zoned> great place to start
[15:27:22] <losing> bronson: http://www.getharvest.com/blog/2011/07/chosen-plug-in/
[15:27:26] <cypha> zoned, is it possible to just make another html page, and make that page the "popup"?
[15:27:34] <cypha> without a refresh
[15:27:50] <cypha> so that jquery just uses the html/css from that page
[15:28:14] <cypha> seems like that would be easier to program
[15:28:17] <zoned> cypha, i think you're getting a bit ahead of yourself. this isn't for some school assignment you're trying to finish at the last minute is it?
[15:28:21] <bronson> pifantastic, looks awesome.  Thanks!
[15:29:08] <austinbv> cypha: this is a jquey room you may want to check out #html or #css first
[15:29:10] <cypha> zoned: lmao,no
[15:29:26] <cypha> html css are straight forward
[15:29:32] <cypha> k, fine, i'm getting on with the tutorial
[15:29:33] <cypha> thanks zoned
[15:29:42] <cypha> really appreciate your help :)
[15:29:55] <austinbv> cypha: you just seem to not have an understanding of basic attributes and selectors
[15:30:00] <austinbv> of tags
[15:30:04] <zoned> cypha, check out w3schools, there's a lot of good tutorials and starters on there
[15:30:21] <austinbv> you need to understand that before you move on to things that work with those selectors
[15:30:45] <austinbv> or you are gonna just dig yourself into a hole and get frustrated
[15:30:53] <austinbv> and what zoned said
[15:31:06] <cypha> okiedokes
[15:31:29] <zoned> http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp, http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp, http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[15:31:37] <zoned> go through those links (in that order) is my suggestion
[15:32:26] <zoned> good luck cypha
[15:32:40] <austinbv> I also think http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html will probably help yu
[15:32:45] <cypha> will do

[15:35:37] <krambiorix> hi guys, this doesn't work: $(id).fadeOut('slow', function() { }); what could be the problem?
[15:35:56] <pifantastic> zoned: I wouldnt ask people to use it as a reference
[15:36:00] <pifantastic> a lot of bad information on there
[15:36:17] <pifantastic> krambiorix: are you sure your selector is matching?
[15:36:40] <krambiorix> pifantastic, the id ? yes...
[15:37:05] <pifantastic> krambiorix: have you tried just $(id).fadeOut() ?
[15:38:01] <krambiorix> pifantastic, doesn't work
[15:38:03] <zoned> pifantastic: i get that w3c "certificates" are garbage, but they have a lot of useful tutorials still. and it's very easy for beginners to pick up.
[15:39:17] <pifantastic> ?p @ krambiorix
[15:39:21] <pifantastic> ugh
[15:39:22] <bot-t> krambiorix, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:39:28] <pifantastic> ah, there you are bot
[15:39:32] <zoned> ha
[15:40:22] <krambiorix> pifantastic, http://pastebin.com/E8LrKmrB
[15:43:18] <pifantastic> krambiorix: Your selector needs a '#' bro
[15:43:40] <pifantastic> var elem = document.getElementById('foo') === $('#foo').get(0);
[15:43:50] <krambiorix> pifantastic, $('#'+id).fadeOut('slow', function() { });
[15:43:58] <pifantastic> yeah
[15:44:23] <krambiorix> pifantastic, no difference :s
[15:44:57] <pifantastic> krambiorix: do this: console.log($('#'+id).length);
[15:45:16] <pifantastic> and check your console (I hope you're using Firebug or Webkit Inspector)
[15:45:37] <pifantastic> you *have* to make sure your selectors are actually selecting something before you just assumed jQuery "doesnt work"
[15:45:58] <pifantastic> ?ftj @ krambiorix
[15:45:58] <bot-t> krambiorix, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[15:46:00] <pifantastic> and read that ^
[15:46:02] <pifantastic> whole thing
[15:46:06] <pifantastic> it will change your life
[15:46:13] <krambiorix> pifantastic, nothing in console :s
[15:46:22] <pifantastic> then your code is unreachable!
[15:46:30] <DrPoole> yowza.  Lots of you.
[15:46:51] <DrPoole> $('#playerForm-' + currentId).serializeArray(); works fine, but $('#playerForm-' + currentId + ' :input').attr('disabled', false); does not
[15:46:55] <DrPoole> any idea why?
[15:47:17] <pifantastic> DrPoole: .attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[15:47:40] <nascro> Why does "previous" never work in this instance: http://jsfiddle.net/nascro/t4zSu/
[15:47:48] <nascro> And "next" always works
[15:48:20] <krambiorix> pifantastic, unreachable??
[15:48:20] <pifantastic> nascro:           if (current = total) {
[15:48:28] <pifantastic> I think you want a "==" there
[15:48:53] <pifantastic> krambiorix: if you put a console.log('WTF') in your code, and you never see "WTF" in the console, then that code is not being executed?
[15:48:56] <pifantastic> nah mean bro?
[15:49:04] <nascro> @pifantastic  I get the same result
[15:49:12] <CodeZombie> would someone mind taking a look at this code? https://gist.github.com/4978f978b15b4de33e00 I'd like to have a single tooltip element... This element's position is set based on where you hover. You can then click a link within the tooltip... However, because hovering over the tooltip counts as a "mouseout" on the selector element, the tooltip fades.
[15:49:19] <pifantastic> nascro: right, but that line of code is fucked, so fix it
[15:49:34] <CodeZombie> is there a way to have the tooltip stay visible?
[15:49:53] <CodeZombie> well, without actually creating a tooltip element under each selector
[15:50:29] <nascro> @pifantastic Got it, thanks ;)
[15:50:34] <coreyo> is there some sort of mutex-like control for asynchronous functions that allows you to kill an already executing, asynchronous block of code?  (i.e. callback function from getJSON is overwritten by a second, fast user event) ?
[15:51:03] <nascro> @sadmicrowave: re: states Well done!
[15:51:17] <krambiorix> pifantastic, where should i see it in Firebug? Errors? Warnings? Info?
[15:51:25] <DrPoole> pifantastic: nothing.  If I do just :input').attr('disabled', false); it successfully turns the entire page's form's on
[15:51:35] <DrPoole> but when i specific which form id i want it fails
[15:54:22] <nascro> @pifantastic getting the same result after fixing those two errors (Updated: http://jsfiddle.net/nascro/t4zSu/1/). It's as iff current == 1 every time.
[15:54:36] <DrPoole> im trying to enable all the fields
[15:55:10] <acidjazz> whats the best calendar/time tool these days for jquery

[16:07:21] <djQuery> krambiorix: see ?demo
[16:07:21] <bot-t> krambiorix, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:09:21] <djQuery> krambiorix: have you tried doing a console.log to see what id is inside of fadeOut? or what $(id) is?   oh and shouldnt that be $('#' + id).fadeOut() ???????
[16:20:15] <DrPoole> thanks for the help internet.
[16:20:16] <DrPoole> :)
[16:35:33] <djQuery> krambiorix: well did it work?
[16:36:04] <krambiorix> djQuery, yeah, a dot in the selector ...
[16:46:34] <gf3> rdrake: NO U
[16:48:25] <djQuery> ?tell kborchers it got denied. they didnt like the way that I was exposing all the options\methods etc of .button
[16:48:25] <bot-t> djQuery, Okay.
[16:48:36] <soule> Hi all
[16:49:31] <djQuery> .seen gnarf
[16:49:32] <hsbot> gnarf was seen 1 hour, 41 minutes and 4 seconds ago, in #jquery-ot, saying: well then the place i saw "curry" used for that was wrong
[16:50:31] <djQuery> gnarf: a long time ago we worked on soemthing to apply ui based on data attributes. I cant find my fiddle do you still have a copy?
[16:50:52] <CodeZombie> is there a way to use a selector so that you get an element with classa, but not classb? for example if the element was <div class="A B"></div><div class="A"></div> I would get the last element, but not the first?
[16:51:23] <welly> Hi chaps. I've got a bunch of checkboxes and basically on a checkbox click event, I want any checked checkboxes other than the one that was just clicked to be unchecked
[16:51:42] <welly> so I've done an input:checked select and added those to a variable
[16:51:50] <CodeZombie> welly, that would be a radio button collection, wouldn't it?
[16:51:54] <seancurtis> .seen dabear
[16:51:54] <hsbot> dabear was seen 51 seconds ago, in #jquery-ot, saying: bentruyman: don't see where that editor is located?
[16:52:03] <welly> CodeZombie: in normal circumstance, it would be. yes :)
[16:52:16] <welly> CodeZombie: and this isn't ideal but it's the only way I can do what I want to do
[16:52:47] <CodeZombie> welly, you could try the siblings method...
[16:52:48] <welly> unless I can turn my checkboxes into radio buttons via jquery I suppose
[16:52:52] <seancurtis> CodeZombie: use a filter
[16:53:09] <kanzie> ajpiano: so even though $.jsonp attaches the same callback-handler for all requests it can keep the responses separated for the success-handler?
[16:53:12] <CodeZombie> seancurtis, thanks!
[17:02:35] <djQuery> grrrrr darn validate http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/qazPA/9/  this works with 1.5.2 but not with higher. ie 1.6.2 http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/qazPA/10/
[17:08:03] <educr0w> I need an advice of a good practice. I'm doing a shopping cart, I have shoppingcart.php that can handle add items, remove items and get the list of items in the cart, If I am using ajax to add, remove and refresh list items, which one is a good practice for returning data to client?
[17:08:59] <ckb> educr0w: which what?
[17:09:50] <educr0w> I don't know, I don't have options in mind that is why I ask about an advice on that topic
[17:10:03] <ckb> JSON is preferable to save bandwidth and page load times, as it doesn't send headers with the response.
[17:10:46] <djQuery> educr0w: and as far as displaying the shoping cart you might want to look at see ?knockout.js
[17:10:47] <bot-t> educr0w, knockoutjs | jQuery Plugins - This plugin is meant to be used with KnockoutJS . http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/knockoutjs
[17:11:17] <djQuery> educr0w: or rather http://knockoutjs.com/
[17:11:29] <educr0w> to use json is correct if I build a php array and return json_encode($my_array) ?
[17:11:43] <ckb> educr0w: yes.
[17:11:49] <djQuery> http://knockoutjs.com/examples/cartEditor.html
[17:11:52] <halphalp> Hi, is it possible to read a file uploaded from a form in jquery?
[17:11:58] <halphalp> i don't care about saving the file, just getting to the content
[17:12:33] <educr0w> djQuery: thanks, I have the Add and Revome events, I was looking an advice retrieving the data
[17:12:42] <educr0w> ckb: thanks :)
[17:12:47] <ckb> halphalp: you can read the size, filename, anything else that's sent with the HTTP multipart request, but not the content.
[17:12:48] <gnarf> djQuery: nope
[17:13:35] <ckb> you would have the upload the file, and then print the contents by means of serverside
[17:13:52] <djQuery> gnarf: thanks anyway
[17:19:44] <coldhead> does anyone know of a good proof for fermat's theorem using jQuery?
[17:21:52] <rubyruy> did jquery.templates get kicked out of core into a plugin?
[17:22:30] <Assimilater> is there something like parseInt for decimal numbers?
[17:23:46] <ckb> Assimilater: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parsefloat.asp
[17:24:25] <ckb> coldhead: wouldn't that be your job to prove it? :)
[17:31:42] <gnarf> rubyruy: it was never truly in core, it was discussed as a part of core, but was release as a plugin
[17:31:53] <gnarf> jQuery.tmpl i believe
[17:32:07] <rubyruy> right right
[17:32:11] <rubyruy> thought it was slated for core
[17:32:13] <rubyruy> guess it was for a while
[17:32:16] <djQuery> rubyruy: see ?.tmpl

[17:40:31] <giako> hi all
[17:44:14] <joikus> you guys
[17:44:26] <joikus> you guys ever mess with http push technology? comet etc
[17:44:55] <coldhead> i heard some guys talking about it once
[17:44:58] <coldhead> but they were drunk
[17:45:04] <joikus> haha
[17:45:05] <coldhead> we all were
[17:45:14] * joikus grabs a drink
[17:46:41] <coldhead> anyhoo, what about push stuff were you wanting to discuss?
[17:49:07] <acidjazz> whats more proper, $('tr').hover(function() { $(this).toggleClass('over'); }); OR: $('tr').hover(function() { $(this).addClass('over'); }, function() { $(this).removeClass('over'); });
[17:49:21] <coldhead> toggleClass, for sure
[17:49:25] <acidjazz> hwo come
[17:49:54] <Brodingo> because coldhead says so
[17:50:04] <Brodingo> ?cc
[17:50:04] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[17:50:37] <acidjazz> lol
[17:51:09] <coldhead> cleaner, simpler
[17:52:04] <coldhead> less to go wrong
[17:57:38] <styol> coldhead: have you tried any particular push type solutions?
[17:58:10] <coldhead> no but i'm going to need to soon i think
[17:58:29] <styol> me haz only used one called APE http://www.ape-project.org
[17:59:41] <styol> but been kind of curious about NodeJS, its supposed to be capable of something similar right
[18:00:51] <htoothrot> i think you're mightily confused
[18:02:06] <styol> its prolly because whatever i've seen so far has mostly been push concept related
[18:03:02] <styol> in relation to things ive seen built with node rather
[18:10:30] <jaypitidi> http://pastebin.com/mEJgmCwK  can someone help me in adding a preloader to my script? it doesn't use get or post and every tutorial I've seen online or script i've downloaded was somewhat dependant on that
[18:11:07] <jaypitidi> I've been using .html(<img src=......gif>).load() but it never shows my gif image
[18:15:35] <kborchers> jaypitidi: i'm confused. when you get newHash, what is that? Have you checked firebug or your console to see if the data you are trying to load is being sent from the server?
[18:15:36] <bot-t> (1 hour 27 mins ago) <djQuery> tell kborchers it got denied. they didnt like the way that I was exposing all the options\methods etc of .button
[18:16:26] <kborchers> djQuery: i had a feeling there was a reason it wasn't already done
[18:19:05] <jaypitidi> kborchers. it is a hashchange plugin. it will add a # to the beginning of the filename. for instance: mysite.com/#about.php and it will load sections dynamically. i get no errors in firebug
[18:23:03] <cjheath> Why does datamappe insist on json ~> 1.4.6? Something wrong with saying >= 1.4.6?
[18:23:22] <cjheath> Other things I have need >= 1.5.1
[18:23:40] <cjheath> Ahcrap sorry, wrong channel
[18:24:00] <cjheath> *&^Q#$*&QE Colloquy
[18:27:34] <kborchers> jaypitidi: ok, so i see what you're trying to do. i wasn't asking about errors in firebug though, i was asking about checking the Net panel to see if the server is sending your contents when you click a link a call load.
[18:27:59] <kborchers> also, why are you adding a space before the # in your URL in load?
[18:28:32] <nascro> @kborchers: check out the improvement I made to the prev/next function and let me know what you think: http://jsfiddle.net/nascro/SVsWt/
[18:29:36] <nascro> @kborchers obviously that's a simplified version of the solution, but the functions are what I'm after
[18:29:55] <nascro> @kborchers can you think of a better way or any improvement to that?
[18:30:48] <kborchers> nascro: nope, i think that looks clean and simple. if you can keep it close to that when you integrate it into your app, that should work nicely.
[18:31:30] <nascro> @kborchers Thanks for the feedback. I'll let you know how it works in a few.
[18:31:35] <kborchers> nascro: one thing, you hard coded 10 instead of using total
[18:31:56] <nascro> @kborchers I noticed that right after I sent the fiddle. Thanks for the heads up.
[18:32:01] <kborchers> yep
[18:32:34] <grobin> hey all, i have a question about plugin development
[18:32:38] <djQuery> kborchers: itwould be that hard towrite it to just expose the individiual .button features. except for the text one. as dialog allready has a text attribute and has a different meaning than the .button
[18:32:39] <kborchers> nascro: you would have gone mad when a state that only had 4 kept going at the end if you hadn't noticed
[18:32:54] <grobin> i have a plugin that creates a few "static variables" by declaring them inside a parent closure
[18:33:11] <kborchers> djQuery: yeah, i read the ticket referenced in scott's feedback ... tough one
[18:33:17] <nascro> @kborchers I didn't even think about the consequences of that mistake.
[18:33:24] <nascro> @kborchers and you're right. I would have.
[18:33:27] <grobin> these variables are accessible in $.fn.myPluginName, and in all of the functions declared immediately inside
[18:33:38] <grobin> but beyond that, it appears as though they are inaccessible
[18:33:56] <nascro> I just changed the 10 to total and the script doesn't work. WTF
[18:34:18] <nascro> What am I missing: if (current != total) {
[18:34:29] <grobin> here's the code: http://pastebin.com/wNQk9rSD
[18:34:30] <kborchers> $(".shelf").children().length
[18:34:36] <grobin> i'd really appreciate it if someone has a minute to take a look!
[18:35:26] <kborchers> nascro: or you could say $(".bin").length
[18:35:30] <kborchers> either way
[18:35:50] <nascro> @kborchers .children().length seems more semantic
[18:35:55] <nascro> meaninful
[18:36:09] <nascro> more code, though...
[18:36:24] <kborchers> unless you would rather just select the items you care about ... and it's probably a little more efficient
[18:36:30] <shiftins> i'm trying to deterimine the actual height of my document regardless of what it's iframe container is set to..
[18:37:04] <shiftins> is $(body).height() the right approach in jquery land, or is there another property besides scrollHeight I should be using?
[18:37:06] <blitz80690> shiftins... try this: http://www.javascripter.net/faq/browserw.htm
[18:37:20] <blitz80690> perhaps there's a jQuery method for that
[18:39:50] <kborchers> shiftins: you mean from outside the iframe ... from the containing page?
[18:40:44] <kborchers> shiftins: if so, try $("#iframeID").contents().find("body").height();
[18:40:48] <kborchers> brb
[18:42:29] <rdrake> I'm having a bit of an issue with the autocomplete widget.
[18:42:43] <shiftins> kborchers: no, I'm inside the frame polling for the height, and on difference I'm sending a message to the parent with the new height
[18:43:12] <jaypitidi> How can I outfit this: http://pastebin.com/mEJgmCwK with a preloading gif before my content loads?
[18:43:19] <shiftins> my problem was I was using scrollHeight which is fine to determine the height and set it, but as the iframe content changes (grows and then shrinks) the scrollHeight returns the iframes height
[18:43:23] <shiftins> and not the body's height
[18:43:36] <shiftins> meaning it never gets smaller
[18:44:05] <shiftins> and $(body).height() seems to do what I want
[18:44:11] <shiftins> i'll read the code
[18:51:22] <kborchers> jaypitidi: if you change $mainContent.hide().load(... with $mainContent.replaceWith("<img src="......gif" />").load(.... it should work
[18:52:28] <kborchers> jaypitidi: sorry messed up quotes $mainContent.replaceWith("<img src='......gif' />").load(....
[18:53:04] <versatiletech> who needs help? Can't help you with mental health though. ;)
[18:55:55] <slaeke> anyone here?
[18:56:25] <versatiletech> ? ask
[18:56:26] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:56:41] <slaeke> ok, will do :)
[18:57:10] <slaeke> I'm wondering how I'd run a jquery script only on one page of my site, if I HAVE to put the script on a template that is used by every page
[18:57:15] <nascro> slake, didn't you do the same thing yesterday?
[18:57:29] <nascro> ;)
[18:57:32] <slaeke> heh possibly
[18:57:48] <slaeke> i just think its polite to ask if there's anyone around, is all
[18:57:59] <versatiletech> slaeke: put it on one page then?
[18:58:00] <slaeke> don't want to impose with my silly questions
[18:58:18] <versatiletech> what are you using for templating?
[18:58:50] <slaeke> @versa, I cant. The page I need to put the script on is an IDX solution hosted page. The only thing I have access to is a "global header" and "global footer"
[18:59:05] <slaeke> but I need to add some text on one page only (I'm using two hosted pages from this IDX solution)
[18:59:23] <slaeke> so, basically, I need to put the script on both pages, but only run it on the one I need.
[18:59:55] <nascro> @kborchers I can't seem to get "scope" right.
[19:00:26] <slaeke> can I use location.href?
[19:00:37] <versatiletech> yes
[19:00:51] <slaeke> and test of it contains some specific string that is only in the URL of the page i need?
[19:01:13] <jaypitidi> kborchers: thanks that does work in loading my gif. The problem I face now is getting the requested content to show after it has finished loading
[19:01:21] <versatiletech> yes
[19:01:56] <slaeke> can I do: $(location.href).containts('my text')
[19:01:57] <slaeke> ?
[19:02:14] <versatiletech> you could use location.href.indexOf()
[19:02:23] <slaeke> ok
[19:02:30] <slaeke> sounds good!
[19:02:32] <slaeke> I'll try it
[19:02:33] <slaeke> thanks!
[19:07:59] <datarecall> i am trying to use jquery .validate and .submit but they do not seem to like eachother is there a better way to do it

[19:09:03] <snollux> ok.. I'm having a bit of trouble with JQuery logic, I guess, and application design. All I want to do is load the results of a PHP script into a div, but without having to use forms to post/get. I'd like it to be more or less instant when viewing a specific page (but not take effect when viewing others)
[19:09:08] <snollux> any hints on how I can do this?
[19:09:09] <versatiletech> datarecall: use jsfiddle.net
[19:09:16] <versatiletech> to show us what you have

[19:10:01] <datarecall> http://jsfiddle.net/enga2/
[19:10:22] <snollux> but I'm not sure what kind of event.. document.ready seems like it would take effect on ALL pages, right?
[19:10:23] <datarecall> the .validate works when im filling out the form but if i leave the form completly blank and then submit it wont validate it at all
[19:10:35] <versatiletech> snollux: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[19:10:41] <versatiletech> :| wrong load
[19:17:55] <snollux> got it, thanks versatiletech. I had read that already but for some reason I missed ONE thing at the bottom the last time
[19:17:59] <snollux> to make a nice, one-time load
[19:24:09] <frewsxcv> just out of curiosity, how does jquery create smooth animations
[19:28:16] <versatiletech> frewsxcv: um I believe it makes incremental changes to the CSS based on a mathematical equation using a timeout or interval function or something in that realm, never looked at the internals
[19:33:55] <frewsxcv> thanks versatiletech. i figured it did that
[19:34:21] <versatiletech> frewsxcv: load the source version of jquery then do a search for // Generate shortcuts for custom animations

[19:43:30] <frewsxcv> i'm trying to remember a website i found recently. it was a list of lightweight javascript libraries
[19:45:23] <coldhead> google.com ?
[19:46:21] <coldhead> vaporjs.com ?
[19:46:39] <LocalPCGuy> http://microjs.com/
[19:48:07] <LocalPCGuy> if that wasn't the one you found, it IS the one you want
[19:48:09] <frewsxcv> thanks it, thanks LocalPCGuy
[19:48:13] <LocalPCGuy> :)
[19:48:31] <coldhead> i heard that site was quite controversial
[19:48:55] <LocalPCGuy> why is that?
[19:49:14] <versatiletech> coldhead: wow that's a really fast framework
[19:49:18] <versatiletech> ;)
[19:50:59] <coldhead> LocalPCGuy: it sparked a lot of debate over microframeworks
[19:51:14] <coldhead> i didn't really understand
[19:51:19] <coldhead> i'm very new to JS
[19:51:28] <versatiletech> pshhhh
[19:52:21] <LocalPCGuy> gotcha - I remember seeing some of the discussion - :shrug: if that is all you need, then great, most websites will require something more but some of them are very cool (yepnope for instance)

[19:56:03] <coldhead> start by asking in #node.js, ale
[19:56:20] <miketaylr> also consider reading the documentation
[19:56:34] <coldhead> node has documentation?

[19:57:16] <coldhead> lol 
[19:57:24] <coldhead> oldhead approves

[20:06:24] <slaeke> so I'm getting a syntax error here

[20:08:15] <slaeke> http://jsfiddle.net/mHAQz/
[20:09:20] <versatiletech> slaeke: is jQuery ever loaded before your script?
[20:09:27] <slaeke> yes
[20:10:04] <versatiletech> do indexOf('blablabla') != -1
[20:10:32] <slaeke> kk
[20:10:58] <coldhead> that's such a sneaky gotcha

[20:11:30] <slaeke> still getting Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[20:11:36] <versatiletech> slaeke: you have to escape your newlines
[20:11:49] <versatiletech> if I'm not mistaken
[20:11:50] <slaeke> why?
[20:11:56] <slaeke> thought whitespace is ignored
[20:13:14] <versatiletech> nope
[20:13:35] <slaeke> the syntax error is caught before any of the newlines
[20:14:53] <slaeke> but i will try getting rid of them, one sec
[20:17:44] <slaeke> didnt work either
[20:19:06] <versatiletech> slaeke: update your jsfiddle.net
[20:19:09] <slaeke> should I add just the div first
[20:19:20] <slaeke> then add the text via .text()?

[20:23:09] <versatiletech> slaeke: http://jsfiddle.net/mHAQz/3/
[20:23:17] <versatiletech> escape the newlines
[20:23:54] <versatiletech> are you using the console in your browser?
[20:23:56] <slaeke> bah
[20:23:57] <zivester> is there a way to define a function, and some default values of that function in one call... so instead of doing var a = function(){ ... }; a.somevar = 1;  is there a way to define a.somevar in the first declaration?
[20:23:58] <slaeke> just a slash at the end?
[20:24:01] <slaeke> yep
[20:24:07] <slaeke> console in chrome
[20:24:12] <versatiletech> k
[20:24:15] <slaeke> but it just tells me syntax error
[20:24:20] <slaeke> not where, or what kind...
[20:24:26] <slaeke> so, do i just slash at the end?
[20:24:33] <slaeke> \
[20:24:34] <slaeke> ?
[20:24:49] <versatiletech> wherever there's a newline/return yes
[20:25:15] <versatiletech> escape the last character before it goes to the next line
[20:25:49] <zivester> this is what im referring to.. is there a different syntax or must it be declared this way? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/61088/hidden-features-of-javascript/61260#61260
[20:26:08] <slaeke> tried that, didnt work
[20:26:11] <slaeke> one sec

[21:06:51] <Whirl3d> Good evening all.
[21:07:49] <zivester> so hi = function(){ this.message = 'a' } is the same as hi = function(){ }; hi.message = 'a' ?
[21:08:13] <Whirl3d> I would like to setup a "close button" with a live statement that works for all types of close buttons. $(".closeButton").live("click",doClose);  but the "doClose" function needs to apply only to the close button's parent. Any help?
[21:08:32] <Cork> zivester: no you need to use a constructor to work like that
[21:09:06] <Cork> zivester: new <function> will give its a this to point to
[21:09:25] <Cork> zivester: in a normal/anonymus function this points to the window object
[21:10:06] * zivester has never used `this`
[21:10:58] <Cork> ?eval function Main() { this.message = 10; }; var main = new Main(); main.message
[21:10:59] <bot-t> Cork: 10
[21:11:44] <Cork> ?eval function Main() { this.message = 10; }; var main = Main(); window.message
[21:11:44] <bot-t> Cork: 10
[21:11:49] <Whirl3d> Is there any way to provide local scoping for a function such that two elements have their own implementation of a funtion named "doClose"?
[21:12:34] <Cork> Whirl3d: only through storing information assosiated to the dom
[21:12:46] <Cork> preferably through ._data or .data
[21:12:46] <zivester> def. interesting and appreciated Cork... I've never used new either... started a job with jquery and never really got into the nitty gritty
[21:13:17] <Cork> for completness
[21:13:23] <Cork> ?eval function Main() { this.message = 10; }; var main = new Main(); window.message
[21:13:24] <bot-t> Cork: undefined
[21:13:28] <Whirl3d> Oh, i see. That's obvious enough now isn't it. Thanks Cork. Don't know why I didn't think of that.
[21:15:34] <zivester> what about namespaces? http://www.dustindiaz.com/namespace-your-javascript/... lemme try ur kool little eval
[21:16:14] <zivester> ?eval var Z = function(){ return { message : 'hello' } }; Z.message
[21:16:14] <bot-t> zivester: undefined
[21:16:32] <zivester> was worth a try :)
[21:16:35] <Cork> close
[21:16:47] <Cork>  ?eval var Z = function(){ return { message: 'hello' }; }; Z.message
[21:16:53] <Cork> gah
[21:16:54] <Cork> ?eval var Z = function(){ return { message: 'hello' }; }; Z.message
[21:16:55] <bot-t> Cork: undefined
[21:16:58] <Cork> hmm
[21:17:03] <Cork> AH
[21:17:10] <Cork> ?eval var Z = (function(){ return { message: 'hello' }; })(); Z.message
[21:17:10] <bot-t> Cork: "hello"
[21:17:37] <Cork> zivester: if you want to stor the responce from a function you need to call it :)
[21:17:40] <Cork> alternatively
[21:17:46] <Cork> ?eval var Z = function(){ return { message: 'hello' }; }; Z().message
[21:17:46] <bot-t> Cork: "hello"
[21:18:23] <zivester> so that last one that executed it immediately to declare everything... is that preferred to:
[21:18:39] <Whirl3d> wow, I am on the verge of understanding so much from this thread Cork.
[21:18:52] <zivester> ?eval var Z = function(){ }; Z.message='hello'; Z.message
[21:18:52] <bot-t> zivester: "hello"
[21:19:26] <Cork> zivester: thats the same thing as doing a constructor
[21:19:27] <zivester> i use that last technique in my code to create static local variables
[21:19:39] <zivester> i just find it ugly
[21:20:00] <Whirl3d> but why have the first part? var Z=funtion () {};
[21:20:14] <Cork> var Z = function(){ }; Z.message='hello'; Z.message is the same as var Z = new function(){ this.message='hello' };  Z.message
[21:20:26] <zivester> well it will actually have code... presumably that uses Z.message in some way
[21:20:47] <Cork> zivester: hmm i need to check something btw
[21:21:00] <Cork> ?eval var Z = function(){ }; Z.message='hello'; Z()
[21:21:01] <bot-t> Cork: undefined
[21:21:09] <Cork> ?eval var Z = function(){ }; Z.message='hello'; Z.toString()
[21:21:09] <bot-t> Cork: "function () {\n}"
[21:21:15] * Cork nods
[21:21:31] <Cork> Whirl3d: thats why :)
[21:21:43] <Whirl3d> almost there...
[21:22:22] <Whirl3d> ?eval var z={}; z.message='test'; z.message;
[21:22:23] <bot-t> Whirl3d: "test"
[21:22:48] <zivester> can one then assign z.function ?
[21:23:01] <Cork> zivester: sure
[21:23:09] <Whirl3d> ?eval var z.message='hello'; z.message;
[21:23:09] <bot-t> Whirl3d: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[21:23:11] <Cork> you can't modify the constructor though
[21:23:34] <Cork> Whirl3d: you can't add members to an undefined variable
[21:23:43] <zivester> ?eval var Z = {}; Z.message = 'hello'; Z.function = function{ Z.message }; Z();
[21:23:44] <bot-t> zivester: SyntaxError: missing ( before formal parameters
[21:23:50] <Whirl3d> just figuring that out
[21:24:01] <Cork> zivester: that would be Z.function
[21:24:14] <Cork> zivester: as i said, you can't modify the constructor (Z())
[21:24:36] <zivester> blarghh.. telling me i must learnnn
[21:24:54] <zivester> so the best solution for my ugly solution would be?
[21:25:11] <Cork> well you can modify it, buth not without losing its members
[21:25:24] <Whirl3d> Cork, how do you modify the function without modiying the constructor?
[21:25:24] <zivester> ?eval Z = function(){ 'inz' }; Z.message = 'hello'; Z.message;
[21:25:25] <bot-t> zivester: "hello"
[21:25:28] <Cork> zivester: i'm not actually sure what your trying to do
[21:25:56] <Cork> Whirl3d: you can for example have a member that you call from the constructor
[21:26:05] <Cork> Whirl3d: thats what jquery does
[21:26:24] <zivester> trying to declare a bunch of functions and variables under a particul namespace
[21:26:51] <Cork> zivester: do you need a main function on the object?
[21:27:10] <Cork> (there isn't really any namespaces in js
[21:27:10] <Cork> )
[21:27:36] <zivester> http://www.dustindiaz.com/namespace-your-javascript/
[21:27:45] <zivester> thats how i mean namespacing it, whatever the term may be
[21:27:48] <Cork> zivester: its just how they like to explain it
[21:27:58] <Cork> zivester: its just an object with its members
[21:28:23] <zivester> i dont think the main object needs a function... but if it doesn't i have to declare it first ya?
[21:28:44] <wookiehangover> ?tias
[21:28:44] <bot-t> Try It And See
[21:29:07] <Cork> zivester: what i do in big projects is things like var app = { func1: function() {}, func2: function() {} }
[21:29:15] <Cork> then app.func1()
[21:29:44] <Cork> you don't have any constructor on that one though
[21:30:03] <Cork> you can think of it as assosiated array (php) or hash (other) if you prefer that
[21:30:23] <zivester> do u also have ... myvar = 1; myother = 2; in there as well?   /perl guy
[21:30:51] <Cork> zivester: you mean private shared variables?
[21:31:10] <Whirl3d> Cork, do you know of any books or sites that show how you setup projects? I struggle daily with deciding on a "style" of programming.
[21:31:35] <zivester> ur example is just a plain old object... what i have been doing, is hiding static variables inside the function... var Z = function{ Z.message }; Z.message = 'hihi'
[21:31:44] <Cork> Whirl3d: no idea, i've built my own style throug experience and small tips over time
[21:32:08] <Cork> zivester: theres no need for that
[21:32:24] <Whirl3d> you should consider writing a book. You have great skills at explaining things clearly and succinctly.
[21:32:53] <KineticColor> Anyone have any clue why this is cacheing the RSS feed data? http://kineticcolor.com/
[21:32:57] <Cork> ?eval var Z = { func1: function() { return Z.message; }, message: 'hello' }; Z.func1()
[21:32:58] <bot-t> Cork: "hello"
[21:33:03] <Cork> ?eval var Z = { func1: function() { return Z.message; }, message: 'hello' }; Z.message
[21:33:03] <bot-t> Cork: "hello"
[21:34:00] <zivester> i guess the difference is, what i think u were asking me earlier.. does the top level need to be a function... ie. Z() isn't defined in ur cases
[21:34:41] <Cork> zivester: ya, but how you did it, didn't add anything to the object
[21:35:08] <Cork> zivester: the example i showed did the exact same thing
[21:35:40] <Cork> zivester: well with the exception that your sets the message when the function is called
[21:36:28] <Cork> KineticColor: your using jsonp, and no timestamp is appended to the url
[21:36:38] <Cork> KineticColor: so the browser will load it form the cache
[21:36:43] <Cork> if it finds it htere
[21:36:47] <Cork> *there
[21:37:37] <zivester> i guess how i was trying to do it... was have Z() be the main function... and have some global variables to that function stored in the same namespace.. to prevent global pollution
[21:37:48] <KineticColor> @Cork how do I append a timestamp to the URL>
[21:37:51] <zivester> i think that this/new stuff earlier I'll have to to a look at
[21:38:30] <Cork> zivester: you might want to have a look at .prototype
[21:39:02] <Cork> KineticColor: its about adding a parameter to the url query that changes over time
[21:39:10] <Cork> so the browser will see it as different urls
[21:40:39] <Cork> zivester: corry no the timestamp is there
[21:40:52] <Cork> so no need to add it
[21:41:10] <Cork> KineticColor: your sure its cached?
[21:41:14] <Cork> shouldn't be
[21:41:36] <KineticColor> I make changes to the RSS feed and they don't show up on the page for quite some time
[21:42:08] <Cork> KineticColor: well the page just append to the page, if thats what you mean
[21:42:18] <Cork> it never updates older fetches
[21:42:29] <Cork> but thats how the plugin works
[21:42:56] <KineticColor> He just added a callback function
[21:43:00] <KineticColor> I am not sure what they are
[21:43:06] <KineticColor> Would that solve my problem?
[21:43:16] <Cork> ?jsonp @ KineticColor
[21:43:16] <bot-t> KineticColor, JSONP, Quickly  plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[21:44:01] <Cork> KineticColor: basically you load a javascript file from a third party server and it sends you a function that you call to get the json
[21:44:37] <KineticColor> How does that apply to my mobile app RSS reader?
[21:44:38] <Cork> KineticColor: its a workaround for cross site scripting blocked by browsers
[21:44:58] <Cork> KineticColor: you mean native apps?
[21:45:05] <Cork> not at all as far as i know
[21:45:20] <KineticColor> I am really confused then
[21:45:50] <Cork> KineticColor: if you load a page from server x and try to load something with ajax from site y
[21:45:56] <Cork> the browser will block the call
[21:46:39] <Cork> but if you instead create a script tag (<script type="text/javascript" src="y/script.js"></script>) the browser will load it
[21:46:54] <Cork> so jsonp is a workaround for that block
[21:47:32] <KineticColor> But how does it relate to my RSS feed caching problem?
[21:48:04] <Cork> KineticColor: i don't see how this could be any cache at all
[21:48:32] <Cork> KineticColor: the only thing i see in the code that could give the effect is that the top messages doens't get updated until you reload the page
[21:48:59] <Cork> KineticColor: if you get a cache beside that, its something server side
[21:49:07] <Cork> or a proxy
[21:49:14] <zivester> i never really understood why block cross domain AJAX calls was a bad thing.. like why does JSONP have to exist?
[21:49:17] <Cork> but thats unlikly (as the url differes)
[21:49:47] <Cork> zivester: you can't download feeds from another domain
[21:49:51] <Cork> for example
[21:49:58] <zivester> y?
[21:50:04] <KineticColor> @Cork http://kineticcolor.com/index.html
[21:50:06] <Cork> zivester: or if you mean why block it
[21:50:13] <KineticColor> @Cork http://kineticcolor.feed43.com/tfm.xml
[21:50:31] <KineticColor> The text isnt there
[21:50:35] <zivester> ya what is the security implication of blocking it... why can't i make an ajax call to y.com from x.com
[21:50:43] <Cork> zivester: cause you can do things like pull content from other logged in pages
[21:50:55] <Cork> zivester: like your bank or what ever
[21:51:31] <zivester> but can't that be done through JSONP anyway ?
[21:52:07] <Cork> zivester: only if the server acutally server jsonp, and don't check the origin of the request
[21:52:24] <Cork> and sites that care about security don't use jsonp
[21:53:03] <Cork> zivester: you can't grab an html page for example through jsonp
[21:53:24] <Cork> zivester: actually you an only load javascipt
[21:53:27] <Cork> no even json
[21:53:35] <Cork> *you can
[21:54:42] <KineticColor> Any clue Cork?
[21:54:44] <zivester> i guess i get it... but jsonp does have its uses
[21:55:00] <Cork> zivester: i don't see what your talking about
[21:55:12] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[21:55:18] <Cork> KineticColor: i don't see what your talking about
[21:55:47] <Cork> KineticColor: but if your browser cache the call even though the url differ, its cache function is broken
[21:56:02] <Cork> KineticColor: but make sure that its really the browser doing it though
[21:56:07] <Cork> cause i really doubt that
[21:56:11] <KineticColor> On the http://kineticcolor.feed43.com/tfm.xml I added "-- I have added this text to the end of every feed item" to the end of every item but it is not showing up on http://kineticcolor.com/index.html
[21:56:26] <Cork> KineticColor: they look the same to me
[21:56:47] <KineticColor> You see "-- I have added this text to the end of every feed item" on Kineticcolor?
[21:56:56] <Cork> ah no
[21:57:18] <zivester> u sure ur code updates its feed on a regular interval?>
[21:57:27] <zivester> u can cache bust it all u want but if it hasn't changed...
[21:57:38] * zivester dont mind me
[21:57:45] <KineticColor> I don't know what I am doing so probably not
[21:57:48] <KineticColor> lol
[21:58:22] <Cork> KineticColor: the json returned from the server 'content: "Written By IHSV 1 day ago"'
[21:58:28] <Cork> and thats an acutall call to the server
[21:58:37] <Cork> so you have something caching it on the server side
[21:59:03] <KineticColor> If either of you would like to help me build this RSS to mobile app thing I would be more than happy to explain the business model to you and profit share
[21:59:34] <Cork> KineticColor: i already have a full time job, so i don't have the time :)
[21:59:52] <KineticColor> @Cork  if ($.isFunction(fn)) fn.call(this,$e); Would this stop the caching?
[21:59:58] <KineticColor> @Cork so do I
[22:00:15] <Cork> KineticColor: you can't do anythihg client side
[22:00:25] <Cork> the server caches the data it sends
[22:00:42] <KineticColor> Can you explain how a callback works?
[22:01:30] <Cork> KineticColor: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/feed/load?v=1.0&callback=jQuery162048624513894876487_1312347648014&q=http%3A%2F%2Fkineticcolor.feed43.com%2Ftfm.xml&num=15&output=json_xml
[22:01:43] <Cork> the content in the file doesn't contain your updates
[22:02:04] <KineticColor> I can't tell it not to cache it?
[22:02:14] <KineticColor> Or to recache it
[22:02:31] <Cork> KineticColor: donno that depends if the server has a way to tell it to update its cache
[22:02:42] <Cork> it has nothing to do with client side
[22:03:29] * zivester ya thats what i was getting at as you 2 were talking
[22:03:38] <zivester> the problem is server side
[22:04:09] * syntech is now away, auto-away after 20 minutes (log\on pager\on)
[22:05:11] <Cork> not, syntech: turn that auto away message off, its completly pointless to spam channels with an away message when you don't even talk in it
[22:06:01] <KineticColor> @Cork couldn't I add a cachebuster string to the end of the URL?
[22:06:31] <Cork> KineticColor: you would have to look in the api specs for googleapis
[22:07:19] <zivester> oh are u saying google isn't updating it's cache of ur site?
[22:07:54] <Cork> yes, i've been saying that quite a few times >_<'
[22:07:57] <KineticColor> @Zivster Are you interested in helping me with this project in a long term sense on the basis of profit sharing? I can explain to you my business plan
[22:08:49] <zivester> haha probably not, this is just a hobby for me
[22:09:32] <zivester> what i do know is the google rss api can cache ur stuff for as long or as little as it wants
[22:10:25] <KineticColor> @zivester-- same here, doesnt mean you can't turn it into something more
[22:10:37] <Nitrxgen> I know this isn't exactly the right place to ask, but I need a little help with some regexp replace in JavaScript
[22:11:20] <KineticColor> @Nitrxgen I assume you already asked and know about ##javascript ?
[22:11:52] <Nitrxgen> nope, is it active?
[22:12:10] <Nitrxgen> 2 # or 1 #?
[22:12:41] <zivester> it looks interesting KineticColor... i dont know a whole lot about feeds... outside of we support a wordpress one at work and i understand cache busting and the google RSS API
[22:12:42] <KineticColor> Two
[22:13:52] <KineticColor> @zivester Most of the feed more is done really aside from this cacheing problem (which really isn't a big deal) Just some functionality issues and animations
[22:14:28] <not> sorry i thought i turnt it off.
[22:14:30] <KineticColor> If you want I can PM you what still needs to be done and explain the business model to you
[22:15:27] <zivester> im going to bed soon, but i dont mind lending an extra hand and here what you are doing
[22:15:53] <Spinkzeit> Does unbind() work for recurisve elements?
[22:17:50] <coldhead> wha?
[22:18:30] <Whirl3d> coldhead! Hooray! What's up, man?
[22:21:55] <coldhead> working hard, buddy
[22:21:59] <coldhead> what's up with you
[22:23:30] <Spinkzeit> Does the $().unbind() function unbind elements recursively? or just the one selected
[22:25:01] <Spinkzeit> totally just learned it doesn't, is there an easy way to make it recursively unbind everything inside an element?
[22:25:06] <coldhead> it unbinds on whatever $() has selected
[22:25:17] <Spinkzeit> yeah :(
[22:25:29] <coldhead> $('#something *').unbind() ?
[22:25:33] <Spinkzeit> really?
[22:25:34] <Spinkzeit> Awesome
[22:25:54] <Spinkzeit> legend.
[22:26:57] <coldhead> crikey
[22:27:21] <Spinkzeit> crikey indeed.
[22:29:37] <coldhead> successful debugging can be very enjoyable
[22:33:10] <Spinkzeit> cheers
[22:34:20] <correctinos> hi i have a selector result and i want to convert it some how to a dom element
[22:34:26] <correctinos> well the first match anyway
[22:34:37] <correctinos> like argument two that is passed to each()
[22:36:28] <correctinos> looks like parent().html() works i guess
[22:36:51] <Cork> correctinos: use .get or []
[22:37:17] <Cork> $(selector).get(0) or $(selector)[0] that will get you the first dom object
[22:38:11] <correctinos> yeah i tried [0] first, hold on, i'll paste a test case
[22:38:45] <correctinos> ahh fadeOut is changing the display attribute, sorry
[22:41:11] <Whirl3d> is there a $.data() selector, or could someone help me to select an element with a data var "index"=someinteger
[22:41:48] <Cork> Whirl3d: you can't really select on data content
[22:42:05] <Whirl3d> Not even with a filter function? Or is it going to be too slow
[22:42:05] <Cork> if the data came from an attribute you can though
[22:42:25] <Cork> $('[data-index="someinteger"]')
[22:42:43] <Cork> Whirl3d: no as its actually not in the dom if its added through js
[22:43:08] <Cork> Whirl3d: you would have to wrap every single dom object in jquery to check if it has it
[22:43:25] <Whirl3d> makes sense. so can you add random attr to elements?
[22:43:42] <Cork> Whirl3d: best is to create a class name
[22:44:02] <Cork> class="objindex-$id"
[22:44:09] <Cork> then just select on it
[22:44:47] <Cork> Whirl3d: if you know its uniq you can create an id instead
[22:44:47] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I have "topics" that exist inside a div. They can be anchor elements, divs, li elements, you name it. I am trying to find a way to select them regardless of their ID or class
[22:45:24] <Cork> Whirl3d: except for there relation (dom position) you can't
[22:46:42] <Whirl3d> I was hoping to have buttons that produced a hash value that could be used to index elements of class "topic", but I am not sure how to do that other than like you said: dom position
[22:47:27] <Cork> Whirl3d: you could build an array/object with pointers to the dom elements
[22:47:40] <Cork> thats basically what .data is
[22:47:59] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I guess I'll have to do that for each page and require each loaded page to index it's own topics.
[22:48:23] <Whirl3d> Cork, thanks for your help.
[22:50:24] <Whirl3d> one more quick question...with dom elements: anchor, li, div, p h1,h2,etc  what is the best way to determine their element class?
[22:50:38] <Cork> class or type?
[22:50:42] <Whirl3d> type
[22:50:43] <Whirl3d> sorry
[22:50:58] <Cork> ?eval $('<input/>')[0].nodeType
[22:51:12] * Cork pokes bot-t
[22:51:23] <Cork> Whirl3d: anyway :/
[22:51:49] <Whirl3d> Cork, so .nodeType of the atual element will tell me in a string format, correct?
[22:52:00] <Cork> yes
[22:52:06] <Whirl3d> you rock, thanks
[22:52:11] <Cork> np
[22:52:31] <Cork> Whirl3d: alternatively you can do something like is('input') if you prefer the jquery way
[22:53:19] <kingfishr> If I want to click a button programmatically, including seeing it activate (i.e. trigger the css "active" state), is there an easy way to do that in jquery?
[22:53:39] <kingfishr> or do i need to change the state myself with a timer, and then call click()
[22:53:45] <Cork> kingfishr: can't be done, you need a fake class
[22:53:56] <Cork> kingfishr: exactly
[22:54:04] <kingfishr> Cork: kk, thanks
[22:54:26] <Cork> kingfishr: :active/:hove is reserved for user actions
[22:54:46] <Cork> so the website isn't allowed to touch them (together with a few other)
[22:59:05] <fructose> I'd like to use both the duration and showOrHide options together, but don't see such an option in jQuery. What would I do instead?
[22:59:08] <sgnome> i'm making a .get() request which calls a php script which in turn echos back a json_encode()'d array .. my question is .. i need to pass it a php array for it to process .. how can i do this?
[22:59:14] <fructose> ... with .toggle()
[22:59:40] <amit_usual> how can i bring all elements of a form to there default state
[22:59:44] <fructose> sgnome: You need to pass what a PHP array?
[23:00:02] <sgnome> i need to pass a php array as the payload to my .get() call
[23:00:27] <sgnome> the php script i'm sending the request to must loop through the array and process it and then return a json encoded response
[23:01:17] <fructose> sgnome: .get has a data option, if I'm not mistaken
[23:01:42] <sgnome> yes it does indeed .. but how do i pass it the php array .. it looks like that's for passing json
[23:02:15] <fructose> sgnome: As far as I know, there's no rule against using json_encode() twice
[23:02:28] <sgnome> ok .. so if i json_encode() it and then pass the json it should be kosher?
[23:03:08] <fructose> sgnome: Well, the data has to be a map or a string
[23:07:42] <fructose> Anyone know how to invoke .toggle() to both animate and force show or hide?
[23:07:45] <sgnome> fructose: ok .. once i pass it in  .. how do i access the incoming data in the php script?
[23:09:35] <ejo> amit_usual: reset the form.  For example, $('form#myform')[0].reset()
[23:10:03] <ejo> amit_usual: it's a javascript command, not a jquery one, which is why the [0] to get the DOM object out of the jquery wrapper
[23:10:56] <fructose> sgnome: Are you sure you're not ahead of yourself if you're trying to use jQuery with PHP before you know how to respond to a GET request?
[23:11:07] <amit_usual> ejo : thanks ... but i tried that but realized what i really was trying to do was a remove an attribute
[23:11:16] <ejo> oh. ok
[23:12:02] <sgnome> lol .. i'm sorta drunk .. it's in $_GET duh lol
[23:14:05] <coldhead> we're all very proud of you sgnome
[23:14:35] <sgnome> lol @ coldhead
[23:14:44] <sgnome> thanks fructose .. i got it from here
[23:20:45] <bEEEeviz> anyone here
[23:20:47] <bEEEeviz> who can tell me
[23:20:49] <bEEEeviz> http://manuelbieh.com/dev/details/
[23:21:08] <bEEEeviz> why the "blabla" textnodes won't get wrapped on iphone?!
[23:21:27] <bEEEeviz> the "test" textnodes are wrapped properly. the blabla arent
[23:36:08] <pickanick_> hello i have 30+ selectbox with same name and id how can i get last selected value, when i use .val() it's give me first select option value
[23:36:30] <coldhead> ?unique id
[23:36:54] <coldhead> well if the bot were here he would reprimand you for having duplicate IDs
[23:36:57] <coldhead> you can't do that
[23:37:00] <coldhead> it breaks things
[23:39:01] <pickanick_> http://jsfiddle.net/Vqp58/ but first function is working right
[23:39:06] <AngryAsian> @pickanick you can do var boxes =  $('select');  var lastBox = boxes[boxes.length-1];
[23:41:33] <pickanick_> so var boxes =  $("#optionvalue").val(); var lastBox = boxes[boxes.length-1]; ?
[23:41:35] <fructose> I have a .expand a:visited.open that sets background-image. I'm writing a function to expand all. is there a way I can use jQuery to trigger that background change too?
[23:42:02] <fructose> Ideally, by making it match the CSS... maybe with addClass? Would that work somehow?
[23:45:49] <AngryAsian> your fiddle code is terrible.  I'm tidying it up and them maybe I can help you
[23:46:51] <AngryAsian> so pickanick_ what exactly do you want again?  you want the value of which select?  your fiddle code has 6 select boxes
[23:47:42] <pickanick_> yep when i change last select option it's give first select opiton value
[23:49:05] <skylercarson> hell yeah
[23:49:14] <skylercarson> jquery ftw
[23:49:37] <skylercarson> is there a way that I can make an input output text system with jquery?
[23:49:38] <AngryAsian> *HIGH FIVE*
[23:49:57] <skylercarson> and how can I make it to where all you have to do is hit the enter key
[23:49:58] <AngryAsian> like chatroom sort of?
[23:50:06] <skylercarson> kinda
[23:50:08] <skylercarson> like
[23:50:37] <AngryAsian> make a text area.  and make it disabled.  then make an input box.  and append whatever you put in the textbox to the textarea
[23:50:41] <skylercarson> I have a <form action = "#" method = "POST"> <input type = "text" class = "input" id = "inputtxt" />
[23:50:42] <AngryAsian> ez
[23:51:10] <skylercarson> Yeah, well i'm gonna need javascript anyways
[23:51:15] <skylercarson> I'm going to make it do commands
[23:51:27] <skylercarson> like
[23:51:33] <skylercarson> if you say date
[23:51:36] <skylercarson> it will post something like
[23:51:54] <skylercarson> root@localhost: 11-02-11
[23:52:11] <skylercarson> xD my 18th birthday
[23:52:47] <pickanick_> AngryAsian : if you see my fiddle i want the value of which select option can you give me any idea or keyword for google

[23:55:55] <AngryAsian> pickanick_ I have no idea what you're trying to do.  Your functions don't entirely make sense.  If you want the value of a select box. You could try making a function using .change() to figure out what is selected. Or you can loop through all the selects and get the value of that particular one
