[00:29:57] <Whirl3d> Good evening all. When developing a site in HTML5, using Jquery 1.7, which is best: Modernizr or html5Shim ? or is there a better solution yet?
[00:45:41] <hearaman> hello good after noon every one "smile!"
[00:46:06] <hearaman> :)
[00:53:08] <__chandra__> hi every one
[01:04:25] <Spadeski> sup
[01:22:22] <^zoggy^> anyone recommend a nice jquery splitter plugin
[01:22:42] <^zoggy^> resizable sidebar/collapseable
[01:24:12] <^zoggy^> http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/ext-4.0.2a/examples/feed-viewer/feed-viewer.html
[01:24:21] <^zoggy^> basically wanna be able to do something like that (left side)
[01:35:48] <Chib> isn't that just using the slide effect to remove the pane and then bring another one in?
[01:41:20] <LSymonds> Chib: What is just using the slide effect?
[01:46:06] <Chib> the thing ^zoggy^ linked
[01:46:35] <LSymonds> Can't see it, chib, could you relink it?
[01:54:37] <Gorkyman> hm.. can I get multiple responses from one ajax call?
[01:54:59] <Gorkyman> I want program to report every few lines and echo that to user
[01:55:37] <Gorkyman> or do I have to init calls for every report ?
[02:01:22] <^zoggy^> http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos.cfm
[02:01:30] <^zoggy^> pretty close
[02:09:20] <Hierofant> UH WTF?
[02:09:26] <Hierofant> anyone awake?
[02:09:32] <Hierofant> Firefox is suddenly on version 8!?
[02:10:29] <wao> sudennly
[02:10:45] <Hierofant> it was version 4 earlier this year
[02:11:08] <Hierofant> so they went thru 5,6,7 and now 8 ( I see 9 is selectable on browsershots)
[02:11:18] <Hierofant> wtftf
[02:11:25] <LSymonds> Chrome for the win.
[02:11:26] <wao> numbers!
[02:11:31] <wao> chrome have actually 17
[02:11:37] <LSymonds> :P
[02:11:40] <Hierofant> yeah but you understand
[02:12:09] <Hierofant> the revampings are normally rare.  IE's only on 9, and Firefox is younger than it by at least what, 7 years?
[02:12:33] <Hierofant> besides what other commercial software puts out 5 releases in  one year?
[02:12:36] <Hierofant> Chrome auto-updates
[02:12:43] <Hierofant> Firefix you have to "go get" the new versions
[02:12:51] <Hierofant> Firefix.
[02:13:52] <nagisaf> yep, some users had complainted the chrome auto-update feature
[02:33:49] <Gorkyman> hmm .click on input type="file" doesnt work for opera...
[02:34:36] <jrockjiggz> input file is very inconsistant
[02:35:28] <Gorkyman> hm... what do you recommend?
[02:36:30] <jrockjiggz> my fav is bluimp jquery uploader
[02:36:47] <jrockjiggz> http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=bluimp%20jquery%20file%20uploader&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCEQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fblueimp%2FjQuery-File-Upload&ei=up2_TrLBDcfe0QHzj-3KBA&usg=AFQjCNExJYFlOzGC_1fAc4gjTuHJ3NdZ_w
[02:36:50] <jrockjiggz> oops
[02:37:09] <jrockjiggz> no that is the address... weird google is tracking
[02:41:50] <techouse> question: i got jquery changing the properties of my menu using hover etc etc. now how do i make a conditional to check if the hovered element or element's parent corresponds to a specific element it/class?
[02:42:38] <techouse> my first try was if($.(this).parent() == $.('div.someclass1')) {blablba}
[02:42:45] <techouse> but it ain't working :/
[02:43:19] <jrockjiggz> if( $(this).attr('id') === 'idname' )
[02:44:03] <techouse> ah
[02:44:19] <techouse> forgot the .attr() thingy
[02:44:21] <techouse> thanx! :)
[02:44:24] <jrockjiggz> np
[02:49:12] <techouse> hah, now how do i check that same conditional upon which nth-child the element is
[02:49:34] <techouse> can't really use .attr() with that, can i?
[02:54:31] <cup> hi there, i got a problem, with .contents
[02:54:41] <cup> at 6229 line in jquery with ie7
[02:55:05] <cup> it tries to appendChild a IXMLDomNode as IHTMLDomNode
[02:55:28] <cup> jquery 1.6.4 ;)
[02:57:47] <cup> i`m trying to get the whole contents of a xml node

[03:38:23] <jankidudel> hi, is it possible with  AJAX response  to  split  it  into the divs without using JSON ?
[03:44:46] <techouse> maybe i'm doing something wrong but jQuery(this).parent().eq(0) selects the same as jQuery(this).parent().eq(1)
[03:44:48] <techouse> :/
[03:58:32] <bbrandon> techouse: you want to use parents()
[04:09:46] <techouse> aaaaaaaaah
[04:09:47] <techouse> oky
[04:09:48] <techouse> :D
[04:10:57] <beakybal4> o.0

[05:04:49] <VeXii> lokking
[05:05:14] <VeXii> think you forgot the JS and to remove the php
[05:06:22] <kanos> i added some thing
[05:06:23] <kanos> http://jsfiddle.net/7wwCz/2/
[05:06:35] <kanos> is it true ?
[05:07:04] <VeXii> you put the javascrip in the javascript box and css in the css box
[05:08:14] <kanos> http://jsfiddle.net/7wwCz/4/
[05:08:40] <VeXii> >_<
[05:09:26] <VeXii> you just put the link's to the JS files thats not going to work.. and try to strip out the wordpress calls and show the final html
[05:10:22] <kanos> VeXii so what i did is not TRUE ?
[05:10:24] <VeXii> done some comments: http://jsfiddle.net/7wwCz/5/
[05:11:01] <VeXii> no script tags a html. not javascipt/jQuery
[05:12:02] <kanos> Done , check it now http://jsfiddle.net/7wwCz/6/

[05:20:35] <kanos> VeXii are u still there ?
[05:21:10] <kanos> okay
[05:22:48] <VeXii> you need to do that on all youre time outs
[05:23:01] <VeXii> but i dont think thats the problem
[05:23:17] <kanos> VeXii yes i think so
[05:23:37] <VeXii> i can see on live youre linking to jQuery multiple times
[05:23:37] <kanos> Could you check it with Team viewer please ?
[05:23:39] <bittyx-windows> i have a $.post request with .fail(function(data){ ... }) tacked on the end - within that fail function, how do i find out the status code of the response?
[05:23:59] <VeXii> you got 3+ script tags to jQuery. cut it down to 1
[05:24:12] <bittyx-windows> i want to handle a 403 status code specially (show a "logged out" message), whereas for other cases, i just want to show a generic error message
[05:24:37] <VeXii> the 2 or 3 argument in the post callback
[05:25:31] <VeXii> net split :o
[05:29:43] <VeXii> Woo00aw a net split :o
[05:30:50] <bittyx-windows> anyway, to ask again - in the .fail(function() { ... } ) callback - how do i check the status code of the response (if there was a response to begin with)
[05:32:12] <VeXii> fail gets some arguments try consol logging tem
[05:32:23] <VeXii> them* kind of sure its under .code
[05:33:14] <bittyx-windows> VeXii: will do, thanks

[05:40:24] <VeXii> whats this everyTime method?
[05:41:16] <TheDragoon> oh sry forgot to comment that, it is causing a delay
[05:42:32] <TheDragoon> To be specific: it loops the content over a specific amount of time
[05:42:50] <VeXii> you just never execute getInTrain function
[05:43:45] <TheDragoon> http://jsfiddle.net/YGuZa/3/
[05:44:18] <TheDragoon> Ups ... shite my fault
[05:46:26] <TheDragoon> Removed to much code.. :P Hope this makes more sense: http://jsfiddle.net/YGuZa/4/

[05:49:53] <VeXii> you can pass it when you trigger the event
[05:50:34] <VeXii> i see you expect a myName and myValue aswell but you dont send em when you trigger the event

[06:17:41] <k_89> so .. how does js handle $.ajax calls .. same way as $.animate() ?? I mean, does it just start the request and move on to the next line of the code , or does it wait for it to complete, (i'm guessing it doesn't

[06:20:29] <walid> hi guys! i feel a bit stupid, but i'm not too familiar with global objects and so, so... i can't debug this:
[06:20:30] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/a3872/2/
[06:20:53] <walid> an object created in one js file doesn't exist in the other..
[06:21:18] <walid> i'm sure it's a very basic change that need to be done, but i can't seem to find what exactly.
[06:21:46] <hackeron> hey, question - I have a resizeable object with an aspect ratio -- how do I resize it to fit on document ready?
[06:22:38] <hackeron> I tried $("#live_layout").width("100%") after my resizable call but that appears to have no effect
[06:26:01] <walid> can anyone give me a very quick hand on this?
[06:26:02] <walid> :)
[06:26:37] <minna> Why isnt this simple replace working? http://jsfiddle.net/USGgW/
[06:27:36] <TheDragoon> Hey back , disconnect --,--
[06:27:53] <TheDragoon> VeXii: still there?
[06:28:13] <Guest96496> hi
[06:32:29] <dabear> minna: that is so wrong in many ways
[06:33:16] <minna> dabear: I bet.
[06:33:29] <dabear> 1) You are doing .html() on the select. .html() returns the innerhtml, which does not include the text onchange
[06:33:32] * troubleman is now playing: Bob Marley - Send Me That Love (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n7mjIZl3c8)
[06:33:57] <minna> dabear: the same using a div outside http://jsfiddle.net/USGgW/
[06:34:06] <dabear> 2) You are getting some text and replacing a value in that text
[06:34:23] <dabear> e.g. you don't put that text back into the dom, so nothing is changed
[06:34:38] <minna> dabear: Ok, i got it. I'll try and make it right.
[06:35:02] <dabear> 3) generally using string replacing, rather than setting the attribute using .attr() is a bad idea. see ?attr
[06:35:03] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[06:35:15] <dabear> ?attr(..,..)
[06:35:15] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName, value): Set one or more attributes for the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr2
[06:36:03] <minna> Im not setting the attribute, im changing the attribute name.

[06:43:48] <walid> i get a soundcloud method does not exist
[06:44:15] <href> walid, this looks like a jquery plugin
[06:44:27] <walid> href: yep
[06:44:30] <href> did you include the plugin file?
[06:44:49] <walid> well soundcloud is defined in the soundcloud.api.js file
[06:45:07] <walid> *soundcloud.player.api.js
[06:45:50] <walid> href: so i don't know why it wouldn't load it :(
[06:46:09] <href> walid, you need to have a reference for soundcloud.player.api.js in the file where you want to use the plugin methods
[06:46:40] <walid> href: hm ok. I never used cross file objects, so i don't know how it works.
[06:47:11] <walid> however it's weird, in the tuto ( http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/custom-player ) they don't mention it..
[06:49:06] <href> Did you add script tags for ../js/soundcloud.player.api.js and ../js/sc-player.js ?
[06:49:36] <href> and did you download these js files?
[06:50:06] <href> http://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-custom-player/archives/master <-
[06:50:40] <walid> yes
[06:50:46] <walid> did you see the fiddle?
[06:50:57] <href> nop
[06:50:59] <walid> files are in the resources.
[06:51:01] <walid> hehe

[06:55:19] <minna> I don't get it. Why doesnt this work in IE7 or IE8? http://jsfiddle.net/KA2jL/
[06:57:11] <shesek> minna, define "doesn't work" ?
[06:57:32] <shesek> and you really, really, really shouldn't be doing that
[06:57:43] <minna> Why not?
[06:58:04] <ahandy> question, what would be the best way to extract the word "last" from the following: "first/second/third/last"?
[06:58:33] <minna> ahandy: In what context?
[06:58:42] <ahandy> minna: "first/second/third/last" :p
[06:58:46] <shesek> ahandy, 'first/second/third/last'.split('/').unshift()
[06:59:03] <minna> ahandy: Is it in text, is it in a class, and id etc?
[06:59:11] <shesek> dunno what you mean by "best", but that'll work
[06:59:11] <ahandy> shesek: would that return 'last'?
[06:59:27] <ahandy> minna: variable :/ so text i guess
[06:59:29] <shesek> oh, sorry, meant pop(), and yes
[06:59:37] <ahandy> shesek: alright, thanks lemme try it
[06:59:38] <minna> shesek: If you have a suggestion to to it any other way, im open to suggestions.
[06:59:59] <shesek> minna, editing HTML that way is a terrible idea
[07:00:11] <shesek> I would do something like that
[07:00:13] <minna> ahandy: you can try .match()
[07:01:14] <minna> shesek: I know, but it's in a CMS so not allowed to change the markup, so i have to change the markup with jquery. I've tried several ways, and this was the shortest and best manageable. As i said, open to suggestions.
[07:01:53] <shesek> $('div').click(function() { ... }).append($("#controlCopy option").map(function(){ return $('<a>').addClass('foobar').attr('href', 'bazqux').text($(this).text()); }))
[07:02:08] <shesek> sorry, meant
[07:02:11] <shesek> $('<div>').click(function() { ... }).append($("#controlCopy option").map(function(){ return $('<a>').addClass('foobar').attr('href', 'bazqux').text($(this).text()); }))
[07:02:22] <minna> Hm, didn't think of using map.
[07:02:31] <minna> Very nice shesek!
[07:02:35] <shesek> $("#controlCopy ).replaceWith($('<div>').click(function() { ... }).append($("#controlCopy option").map(function(){ return $('<a>').addClass('foobar').attr('href', 'bazqux').text($(this).text()); })))
[07:03:05] <walid> href: any clue?
[07:03:06] <walid> ^^
[07:03:56] <minna> shesek: That doesnt work in the fiddle, somethings missing.
[07:04:38] <shesek> well, I didn't actually test this code, it probably won't work as-is
[07:07:21] <minna> Ok
[07:07:23] <minna> Thanks
[07:08:12] <shesek> http://jsfiddle.net/KA2jL/2/
[07:08:51] <minna> shesek: Thanks, i think i got my head around this now. Thanks for the help
[07:09:07] <shesek> you welcome

[07:55:30] <minna> Nice way to add text just before the end </a> tag?
[08:02:12] <Toine_> hi

[08:05:58] <Toine_> and reg/closeButton cant be var?
[08:12:14] <siobhan> Hi jQuery people
[08:13:35] <siobhan> Anyone there?
[08:15:16] <shesek> siobhan, just ask the question
[08:15:35] <siobhan> it's about this site: http://j-query.org
[08:15:44] <siobhan> I was wondering if anyone knows anything about it
[08:15:51] <siobhan> it redirects to jquery.org
[08:15:57] <siobhan> but it's not registered by jquery
[08:18:45] <PhonicUK> if I handle a change() event on a form field, can I find out what the old value was?
[08:19:27] <cup> any idea why onsubmit in ie dont work?
[08:19:34] <cup> with the enter key
[08:19:39] <shesek> cup, code
[08:19:47] <shesek> siobhan, someone probably bought it and didn't have anything to do with it, so he put a redirect
[08:20:06] <cup> shesek: nothing special, onsubmit="somefunc(); return false"
[08:20:06] <shesek> PhonicUK, IIRC, no. You can keep track of that manually, tho
[08:20:16] <PhonicUK> aye - just wondering if there was a better way
[08:20:29] <siobhan> okay, it's just someone is creating WordPress plugins that link to jquery hosted on j-query.org
[08:21:28] <cup> shesek: the somefunc(); isnt executed
[08:21:35] <cup> when i press the enter key.
[08:21:39] <cup> on ff its ok
[08:21:56] <shesek> PhonicUK, seems like the `defaultValue` attribute contains the original value it had (during page load, that is) if that helps (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1909992/how-to-get-old-value-with-onchange-event-in-text-box)
[08:22:18] <PhonicUK> aye I need to know what it was after its been changed once, and then again
[08:22:41] <shesek> yeah, I imagined it wouldn't help you
[08:22:49] <shesek> cup, two things
[08:23:02] <shesek> a. Use proper event binding instead of having javascript code all over your HTML
[08:23:12] <shesek> b. What does that have to do with #jquery ?
[08:24:06] <PhonicUK> hmm, you can't have an empty action in a form for HTML5 :\
[08:24:10] <cup> shesek: nothing, maybe someone did resolve that ;)
[08:24:12] <shesek> I haven't worked with HTML event attributes for a long time, but I guess IE could have some issue with it... if you'll work with jQuery event binding instead it should overcome any IE quirks
[08:24:33] <cup> well i try to bind it
[08:24:40] <dabear> PhonicUK: .prevValue?
[08:24:45] <shesek> PhonicUK, really? why not? :O I use that all the time to send the form to the same URL
[08:24:46] <cup> with jquery instead in html
[08:25:02] <xnotte> can anyone help me ? http://jsfiddle.net/9gWYQ/ the scroll its a bit buggy, it now always goes to the right #div
[08:25:05] <PhonicUK> shesek, no idea - but the w3c validator says its invalid
[08:25:16] <PhonicUK> you can however do action="." to send it to the same page I think
[08:25:39] <shesek> PhonicUK, IIRC it won't preserve query string and filename
[08:25:57] <PhonicUK> indeed it won't
[08:26:15] <PhonicUK> its annoying because XHTML1.1 allows it
[08:26:18] <PhonicUK> but HTML5 doesn't
[08:27:11] <shesek> dabear, cool, didn't know about that
[08:28:52] <shesek> PhonicUK, "Per Web Forms 2 you can also omit the action attribute when set to the empty string" @ http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/improve-your-forms-using-html5/
[08:28:55] <dabear> meh, seems it only works in mutation events
[08:29:08] <PhonicUK> shesek, the W3C validator diagrees
[08:29:12] <PhonicUK> *disagrees
[08:29:55] <PhonicUK> it first complained of the missing attribute, then the invalid value when I left it empty
[08:30:31] <PhonicUK> oh i tell a lue
[08:30:33] <PhonicUK> *lie
[08:30:38] <PhonicUK> it just doesn't like the empty value
[08:30:42] <PhonicUK> but you can ommit it entirely
[08:31:59] <PhonicUK> ah XHTML 1.1 requires the value
[08:32:20] <PhonicUK> which can be empty
[08:36:37] <dabear> shesek: PhonicUK: here's a way to get the previous value.. http://jsfiddle.net/H9nFW/1/
[08:37:02] <PhonicUK> thats pretty much exactly what I've done
[08:38:34] <pindemon> hello world
[08:38:36] <dabear> ok, haven't seen your code:)
[08:39:43] <tomasm-> hi, if i define a function that wraps an object, via $.fn.something = function() { ... }, how I define functions that can be operated on that object?
[08:39:43] <pindemon> I'm trying to setup a plugin for wordpress that uses jquery - but it's not acting as it should - reading the faq on the dev's webpage it states that "Either your theme files or another plugin is loading jQuery a 2nd time â€“ this will result in the code required for the menu being overwritten"
[08:40:24] <pindemon> pindemon: his solution doesn't work for me - can somebody assist me on this as I really no have knowledge of jquery?
[08:45:57] <TheDragoon> I was wondering if it is posible to bind() in one method and then trigger() in another.. Anyone can give me some help with that?
[08:47:31] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: yes, it's possible
[08:48:23] <TheDragoon> ryannneufeld: Could you give me an example?
[08:48:37] <TheDragoon> or link me to one ;)
[08:48:45] <ryannneufeld> ?trigger @ TheDragoon
[08:48:46] <bot-t> TheDragoon, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[08:50:02] <TheDragoon> Ye I have studied that page more than once indeed.
[08:50:29] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: what is it that you're confused about then?
[08:52:47] <TheDragoon> you mind me sending PM ?
[08:53:43] <ryannneufeld> I prefer here, besides others might have solutions, or the same problem
[08:54:12] <TheDragoon> True
[08:54:23] <TheDragoon> This is the case:
[08:54:56] <TheDragoon> I have a function Train and Station, when I click the Station the 'passengers' wil countdown. When the counter is at 0 the station should "warn" the specific train, so it can move
[08:55:04] <TheDragoon> http://jsfiddle.net/YGuZa/6/
[08:55:09] <TheDragoon> here is my sketch
[08:55:21] * ryannneufeld looks
[08:56:37] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: you realize that you're not extending anything right?
[08:56:56] <TheDragoon> Uhm sorry?
[08:57:05] <ryannneufeld> jQuery.fn.extend(
[08:57:09] <TheDragoon> (quite new to JQuery sr)
[08:57:15] <ryannneufeld> what is it that you think that's extending?
[08:58:25] <TheDragoon> huh ?
[08:59:39] <ryannneufeld> /* START: Common-used */
[08:59:39] <ryannneufeld> jQuery.fn.extend({
[08:59:52] <ryannneufeld> What is it that you think those lines of code are doing?
[09:00:44] <TheDragoon> That Common-used is a 'library' for the timer (everyTime etc)
[09:00:52] <ryannneufeld> oic
[09:01:01] <TheDragoon> ;)
[09:01:03] <ryannneufeld> so everything above that is yours then?
[09:01:16] <TheDragoon> yes
[09:02:15] <ryannneufeld> $(document).bind(trainId + ".Ready", function(e, myName, myValue)
[09:02:20] <ryannneufeld> what is that supposed to do?
[09:02:57] <TheDragoon> That was an attempt to use the bind and trigger
[09:03:18] <TheDragoon> a bad one I suppose :P
[09:03:30] <ryannneufeld> I an see that, not what i was asking though :p
[09:03:38] <TheDragoon> I tried to make a custom 'bind' and 'trigger'
[09:03:39] <ryannneufeld> what was the result you were looking for?
[09:04:16] <TheDragoon> When the counter is at 0 the 'station' should trigger the train
[09:04:38] <ryannneufeld> trigger a click on the train?
[09:05:03] <TheDragoon> no trigger the passengersReady (so just the variable is getting changed)
[09:05:21] <ryannneufeld> oh, it doesn't work that way
[09:05:51] <TheDragoon> I got so far :P But what is the right way? :P
[09:06:49] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: lemme see if I can find something that can work for you
[09:06:50] <ryannneufeld> k?
[09:07:04] <TheDragoon> Would be great ryannneufeld
[09:09:00] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: okay
[09:09:00] <ryannneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/SDDsd/
[09:09:05] <ryannneufeld> so you can use custom events
[09:09:14] <ryannneufeld> you were just binding in a terrible way
[09:09:23] <ryannneufeld> you shouldn't bind to the document like that
[09:09:50] <ryannneufeld> also, you're creating a random trainid
[09:09:55] <ryannneufeld> and then binding to it
[09:10:13] <TheDragoon> hmmz okay
[09:11:28] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: okay, Ima school you a little here :p
[09:11:47] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: also, you can cache the train div so you don't have to select it again later
[09:11:49] <ryannneufeld> I'll show you
[09:12:23] <TheDragoon> I'm quite new so that would be great :) thanks ryannneufeld
[09:13:19] <TheDragoon> ryannneufeld: Will you still be online in 10 minutes?
[09:13:29] <ryannneufeld> yeah, probably
[09:13:39] <ryannneufeld> It'll take me about that long to get your code cleaned up
[09:13:51] <TheDragoon> oh okay. dinner is ready here
[09:14:03] <TheDragoon> thanks very very much for your help ryannneufeld
[09:14:18] <ryannneufeld> np
[09:14:23] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: I just got up
[09:14:28] <ryannneufeld> haven't even had breakfast yet :p
[09:20:10] <guy> so cool http://igrapher.com/#m?0:3;stock?BAS.DE:GDAXI;stock?HEI.DE:GDAXI;z?30;
[09:22:34] <abjorn> >mfw I realize I've been playing Skyrim on Adept this whole time
[09:34:34] <TheDragoon> hah ryannneufeld i'm back. Where are ya from then?
[09:34:44] <ryannneufeld> Canada
[09:34:47] <ryannneufeld> West coast
[09:35:16] <guy> is there anything more recent? http://jquery.lukelutman.com/plugins/flash/
[09:35:20] <guy> this script is 2006
[09:35:45] <ryannneufeld> guy google will tell you that better than any of us
[09:35:47] <Woet> guy: why are you using flash instead of html5?
[09:35:59] <ryannneufeld> guy: also look at swfobject
[09:36:18] <guy> ryannneufeld: well, isn't it the same? jquery version just utilizes jquery DOM helpers.
[09:36:37] <guy> oh. its the name of jquery plugin.
[09:36:46] <ryannneufeld> ;)
[09:37:17] <TheDragoon> ah cool ryannneufeld. I'm from The Netherlands ;)
[09:37:35] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: cool, our front end dev is from there too
[09:40:33] <TheDragoon> nice
[09:43:13] <TheDragoon> ryannneufeld: any luck with the code?
[09:43:32] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/YGuZa/10/
[09:43:43] <ryannneufeld> that's about as close as I can get you right now
[09:43:59] <ryannneufeld> you have some visibilty issues with your currentTrain etc
[09:44:24] <ryannneufeld> but the idea is that you should be binding and triggering on the trains with a custom event
[09:44:31] <ryannneufeld> not on the document with a bunch of custom events
[09:44:56] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/SDDsd/ a simplified example
[09:46:45] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon: I just updated that to a better example
[09:51:28] <TheDragoon> hmmz
[09:57:17] <TheDragoon1> arg, disconnected
[09:58:15] <ryannneufeld> TheDragoon1: wb, i gotta run man, but good luck. I hope my examples help
[10:00:17] <TheDragoon1> Ah okey! thanks for your help so far ryannneufeld ! really appreciate it ;)
[10:00:23] <ryannneufeld> np
[10:10:21] <Tomasso> i did  $('input[name^="addr"]') .blahblah(); from that set of inputs, how do i select the one that is being filled by the user?
[10:16:19] <ryannneufeld> ?focus-selector @ Tomasso
[10:16:20] <bot-t> Tomasso, :focus selector - Selects element if it is currently focused. http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[10:27:51] <TheDragoon> ryannneufeld thanks to you I fixed it :)
[10:28:23] <tomasm-> question... does updating a field via val('value') also trigger onChange?
[10:40:59] <tomasm-> anyone know how I can strip html from an arbitrary string? it's not in a container, but from a textarea...
[10:43:32] <conic> hi all, general techniques question:
[10:43:33] <conic> if my menu loads content via ajax, how do i best save the loaded "page" in the #thisPage part of the url by clicking and how do i handle that information if someone opens that link directly afterwads?
[10:56:46] <natdivad> how can i get the CONTENT of the every span with class rawfilename? currently i'm using jQuery("span.rawfilename"), it's working but i only want what's in the span
[10:57:54] <TheDragoon> maybe jQuery(".rawfilename span")
[11:08:58] <Nyture> is there a way to trigger a checkbox inline "onchange" event via a jquery script? i.e. <input onchange="dothis"> and in jquery $('input[type="checkbox"]').attr('checked',true); and have the check event in jquery trigger the inline event?
[11:09:57] <Haprog> Nyture: .change() or .trigger('change')
[11:11:51] <StijnH> Hello. Any way to get http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10662 reopened? I was hoping the person who closed it would read my comment and reopen but it's been over a week.
[11:11:58] <Nyture> tried that to no avail. It doesnt trigger the onchange event in the html.
[11:18:59] <Nyture> http://jsfiddle.net/6SM5T/
[11:25:18] <Nyture> http://jsfiddle.net/6SM5T/7/ - think I cleaned it up enough to give a more accurate picture.
[11:27:06] <ryannneufeld> StijnH: looking at your bug report, chances are they will not reopen it.
[11:27:50] <ryannneufeld> Nyture: it's onclick, not onClick, and both should work
[11:29:31] <StijnH> ryannneufeld: how come? I've provided a clean test case reproducing the bug (jsfiddle has other stuff on the page, somehow working around the bug).
[11:29:39] <Nyture> should but aint lol
[11:29:48] <ryannneufeld> Nyture: clearly
[11:30:08] <muhoo> i'm seeing this construction (function($,something){stuff...})(jQuery);  what does it mean?
[11:30:18] <muhoo> and is that the most current best practices of how to do  it?
[11:30:32] <ryannneufeld> StijnH: did you read the comments?
[11:30:47] <ryannneufeld> StijnH: timmywil said: This does not seem to be an issue in the latest version of jQuery.  http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/Ph7pG/
[11:31:05] <ryannneufeld> StijnH: so why would they re-open it if it's not a bug?
[11:31:11] <StijnH> ryannneufeld: the latest version does not matter. It is simply not reproducible on jsfiddle, with any version. I've then added a link to a jsbin test case with the latest version, reproducing the bug.
[11:31:12] <muhoo> sorry, it's: (function($,undefined){stuff...})(jQuery);
[11:31:26] <muhoo> what would such a thing actually do?
[11:31:48] <ryannneufeld> muhoo: that's a immediately invoked function expressoin
[11:31:49] <Nyture> create a plugin?
[11:31:55] <ryannneufeld> ?g iife ben alaman
[11:31:56] <bot-t> ryannneufeld, Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) - http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[11:32:04] <ryannneufeld> ?g iife ben alaman @ muhoo
[11:32:05] <bot-t> muhoo, Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) - http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[11:32:12] <muhoo> thank you all!
[11:32:21] <knapper_tech> html() grabs the contents of an element.  how can i grab the entier element (with enclosing tags)
[11:32:21] <ryannneufeld> muhoo: bot-t is a bot ;p
[11:32:29] <khmer> muhoo: the "undefined" bit is because in some circumstances (IE), the "undefined" keyword can be redefined
[11:32:41] <ryannneufeld> knapper_tech: .prop('outerHtml'); I think
[11:32:49] <khmer> muhoo: so if you set "undefined" to the second argument of a function that receives one argument, you've redefined it as undefined in case it was set to something else
[11:33:01] <khmer> muhoo: the rest of it is pretty self-explanatory
[11:33:14] <ryannneufeld> muhoo: also, what you're seeing is a common method for creating a jquery plugin
[11:33:31] <ryannneufeld> StijnH: chances are that it's something on jsbin that is causing it
[11:33:41] <muhoo> ryannneufeld: thanks a lot!
[11:33:54] <ryannneufeld> muhoo: np, what khmer said was correct as well
[11:33:55] <snover> khmer: undefined can be redefined in any browser, not just IE.
[11:34:11] <khmer> snover: yr kiddin
[11:34:12] <khmer> wow
[11:34:15] <ryannneufeld> muhoo: at least about passing it in cause it can be re-defined
[11:34:19] <Nyture> js fiddle doesnt line inline javascript does it?
[11:34:22] <Nyture> *like
[11:34:27] <khmer> snover: it's true
[11:34:34] <StijnH> ryannneufeld: no, it's not. jsbin renders an unmodified version of the input. In contrast to jsfiddle, which renders a modified version of the input.
[11:34:38] <snover> I know itâ€™s true, I just said itâ€¦
[11:34:46] <Nyture> http://jsfiddle.net/6SM5T/10/
[11:34:49] <ryannneufeld> snover++
[11:35:02] <khmer> snover: why isn't it a reserved word!! herp derp!
[11:35:20] <StijnH> ryannneufeld: before submitting the bug I've actually tried it on a simple local html file on the listed browsers.
[11:36:35] <knapper_tech> ryannneufeld:   settled on detach()
[11:36:45] <ryannneufeld> knapper_tech: ?
[11:37:05] <ryannneufeld> StijnH: you found a bug in your css, not jquery
[11:37:36] <ryannneufeld> StijnH: at least thats what it appears to be to me
[11:37:56] <StijnH> ryannneufeld: my CSS is fine as far as I know.
[11:38:47] <Nyture> StijnH: are you using a css reset by any chance?
[11:39:18] <StijnH> Nyture: no, I'm not. The test case I've supplied is as reduced as possible.
[11:39:25] <ryannneufeld> I'm checking
[11:39:54] <ryannneufeld> maybe another set of eyes can help
[11:39:58] <Nyture> url?
[11:40:05] <ryannneufeld> http://jsbin.com/onuyij/edit#source
[11:41:11] <LSymonds> Works for me?
[11:41:13] <knapper_tech> ryannneufeld: detatch() removes the element and returns it so you can do var foo = $('#id').detatch();
[11:41:39] <ryannneufeld> knapper_tech: yeah, why are you telling me this?
[11:42:01] <ryannneufeld> LSymonds: click on the "top margin and no margin" you'll see what he's saying
[11:43:32] <Nyture> looks like its giving it a top-margin of 0 when its running
[11:43:59] <Nyture> set inline, then when its done executing, removes the style, and the original top margin takes effect
[11:44:47] <ryannneufeld> yeah, that's what I am seeing as well
[11:45:08] <Nyture> im thinking innerdiv will solve the problem
[11:45:23] <Nyture> not the best solution, but for the time being...
[11:46:08] <Nyture> yup
[11:46:21] <Nyture> simply applying the style to an inner element fixes it far as i can tell
[11:46:38] <Nyture> ".top_margin p"
[11:47:28] <ryannneufeld> it's their normalized CSS that's causing it to work on the jsfiddle
[11:48:36] <knapper_tech> I need to strip all the class attributes from a block of html
[11:49:45] <ryannneufeld> knapper_tech: k, I still am not sure why you're telling me about detatch? Was I helping you with something in the past?
[11:51:34] <knapper_tech> yes
[11:51:59] <knapper_tech> more refined question:   I need to use a selector on a chunk of html stored in a variable
[11:52:27] <knapper_tech> i mean that's the elegant way, but i'm about to just firehose it
[11:52:35] <knapper_tech> because it's faster =)
[11:53:26] <ryannneufeld> StijnH: well, I just added a comment for you. I think you're on to something. When I disable the normalized css it does the same thing on jsfiddle
[11:53:51] <StijnH> ryannneufeld, Nyture: thank you for looking into this.
[11:53:52] <ryannneufeld> knapper_tech: you can use all the jquery methods the same way on a fragment
[11:54:30] <knapper_tech> ryannneufeld:   how do I run the selector on the fragment?
[11:54:36] <knapper_tech> as opposed to the whole doc
[11:54:41] <ryannneufeld> $('<div class="one two three"></div>').removeClass(
[11:54:46] <ryannneufeld> doh
[11:54:52] <ryannneufeld> $('<div class="one two three"></div>').removeClass('two');
[11:55:04] <ryannneufeld> will return a jquery object that will have
[11:55:09] <knapper_tech> ryannneufeld: thanks.
[11:55:16] <ryannneufeld> <div class="one three"></div>
[11:55:32] <ryannneufeld> if you're using detatch, then you can just chain it
[11:55:53] <ryannneufeld> so $('selector').deteach().find('thing').removeClass()

[12:00:16] <kanzie> Im struggling with something that should be real easy but I can't understand what Im doing wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/rjNsW/2/
[12:00:19] <Nyture> rebuilt my function for jsfiddle so you can see what im trying to do (essentially). However, I cant seem to get triggah() to fire. Any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/6SM5T/14/
[12:00:43] <kanzie> Anyone have any ideas why I only get init-values in my vars instead of the updated values they should contain
[12:00:50] <ryannneufeld> Nyture: why don't you just bind to the change event on the checkbox
[12:00:57] <ryannneufeld> Nyture: or is there some reason you can't?
[12:01:17] <Nyture> unfortunately, 2 different scripts, one built by me, the other not
[12:01:37] <Nyture> the triggah() function was built in by someone else
[12:01:45] <Nyture> Im just trying to get it to fire when my red box is clicked
[12:01:57] <ryannneufeld> oic
[12:02:21] <ryannneufeld> kanzie: you're not returning anything from your setUsers function that's why
[12:02:33] <Nyture> I tried extracting it to a variable using RegExp and triggering it that way but that didnt work either
[12:02:39] <kanzie> ryannneufeld: but I am updating the local variable
[12:02:43] <ryannneufeld> Nyture: you could grab the attr('onclick') and eval it
[12:02:44] <eddiemonge> Nyture: use .prop() there
[12:02:48] <last1> if I create a new element inside a div using something like: $("#mydiv").html("<select id='sel1'>...");
[12:02:55] <last1> how can I then bind an event to sel1 ?
[12:03:11] <ryannneufeld> Nyture: listen to eddiemonge he knows better than I
[12:03:21] <last1> I tried: $("#sel1").bind('change', function() { }); but it doesn't trigger
[12:03:22] <kanzie> ryannneufeld: I expect I can get the variable without using a function() { return myVar };
[12:03:47] <ryannneufeld> kanzie: Auth returns
[12:03:53] <ryannneufeld> so that's what you're getting
[12:04:11] <eddiemonge> Nyture: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/6SM5T/15/
[12:04:28] <Nyture> tried prop, basically same thing as attr, still wouldnt fire
[12:04:34] <kanzie> ryannneufeld: yeah, but Auth.users should give me the _users variable, no?
[12:04:59] <eddiemonge> last1: var $new = $("<select id='sel1'>..."); $("#mydiv").html($new)
[12:05:10] <eddiemonge> last1: or use delegate() or on()
[12:05:38] <last1> eddiemonge: that part is working
[12:05:44] <Nyture> ah ha
[12:05:46] <last1> what's not working is binding a 'change' event after I create my select
[12:05:47] <Nyture> thanks ryan
[12:05:54] <Nyture> eval was what I needed
[12:06:07] <Nyture> damn you google for giving me regexp!
[12:06:08] <eddiemonge> last1: like i said, you need to use .delegate() or .on() see ? on
[12:06:08] <bot-t> last1, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:06:09] <Nyture> lol
[12:06:17] <ryannneufeld> Nyture: now, be warned, eval is EVIL
[12:06:35] <ryannneufeld> but it should be firing that either way, which is confusing
[12:07:28] <eddiemonge> Nyture: did you see my example?
[12:07:44] <last1> nope, .on() doesn't work either
[12:07:48] <ryannneufeld> eddiemonge: your example didn't have any onlick or onchange attrs in it
[12:08:02] <Nyture> no but lemme look
[12:08:06] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ last1
[12:08:07] <bot-t> last1, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[12:08:13] <eddiemonge> Nyture: what is the issue again?
[12:08:20] <last1> I'm using: $("#sel1").on('change', function() { alert("hello"); })
[12:08:27] <Nyture> I got it working :) kinda
[12:08:29] <last1> ok, one sec
[12:08:39] <kanzie> ryannneufeld: any ideas how I could get it working the way I expect it to?
[12:09:01] <Nyture> theres a php script im running with some inline javascript (onclick in html), and i was trying to get it to fire from my jquery function
[12:09:02] <eddiemonge> Nyture: you mean this: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/6SM5T/16/
[12:09:09] <ryannneufeld> eddiemonge: can you look at kanzie's example, I don't know how to help him
[12:09:21] <eddiemonge> Nyture: can you get rid of the inline js?
[12:09:28] <ryannneufeld> eddiemonge: no, he can't
[12:09:33] <Nyture> unfortunately, no, not without extensive hacking
[12:09:42] <eddiemonge> last1: thats binding to an element thats not there. you need to bind to a parent and then target sel1
[12:09:56] <Nyture> If I had built the script, or if I hadnt paid $150 for it, maybe lol
[12:10:02] <eddiemonge> Nyture: that is disgusting. purely disgusting. i refuse to help then
[12:10:10] <eddiemonge> ?pe kanzie
[12:10:12] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Amazon.com: Profile for Kiddiss - http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2K2ZH7BDCZSFH
[12:10:16] <Nyture> lol eddie, i feel the same
[12:10:18] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ kanzie
[12:10:19] <bot-t> kanzie, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[12:10:32] <Nyture> fortunately, ryan already helped
[12:10:41] <kanzie> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/rjNsW/2/
[12:10:42] <ryannneufeld> Nyture: I have a better idea
[12:11:16] <ryannneufeld> do you controll the markup?
[12:12:42] <last1> well, this is weird. it works in the online example I built. lol
[12:13:28] <Nyture> to an extent
[12:13:35] <Nyture> whats your idea
[12:14:02] <ryannneufeld> Nyture: well, you can just call the function in the onchange
[12:14:17] <ryannneufeld> in the click handler of your red box
[12:14:31] <ryannneufeld> if it's always the same function
[12:15:03] <ryannneufeld> certainly safer than eval
[12:16:08] <herbySk> more a dev team question probably, but I'd like to know: ES5 is out there for a pretty long time, 2 years in this December. It is fairly spread and supported. Now, as a person that came from server js to client js, I see there is lot of "helper" implementations, like $.each. Is it planned (in jQuery 2.0 maybe?) to stop to carry this legacy and write the framework solely based on ECMAScript 5?
[12:16:19] <Nyture> ...
[12:16:24] <Nyture> hold on
[12:16:52] <Nyture> if this works im gonna be pissed i didnt think of it earlier
[12:16:55] <eddiemonge> herbySk: you know the $.each is jQuery right?
[12:17:34] <ryannneufeld> herbySk: if anything they would wrap the native for each if it was available instead of removing a function
[12:17:35] <herbySk> eddiemonge: yes. I'd like to use forEach, every, Object.keys, ... I
[12:17:53] <kanzie> eddiemonge: you have any ideas for me?
[12:17:59] <eddiemonge> foreach isnt standard. and there most likely never will be a jQuery 2.0
[12:18:03] <herbySk> ... as I used to on server. I see $.each is prevalent on client side...
[12:18:15] <eddiemonge> and browsers never die. look at ie6 for example
[12:18:16] <herbySk> ... but maybe it is time to switch to ES5>
[12:18:17] <herbySk> ?
[12:18:18] <Vaerros> any solutions for drag and drop on iOS 5? the jquery-ui-pbakaus patch I've been using works on pre-iOS5
[12:18:33] <eddiemonge> kanzie: im still trying to figure out what you are trying to do and why you are doing it so difficultly
[12:18:42] <herbySk> eddiemonge: sorry? forEach IS standard
[12:19:51] <kanzie> eddiemonge: Module-patternâ€¦ Its part of a class and Im trying to expose variables. So this is the model and it has an array of users. I need to access this array from the controller. So Im trying to not need a function-call but just expose the var.
[12:19:56] <eddiemonge> herbySk: "forEach is a recent addition to the ECMA-262 standard; as such it may not be present in other implementations of the standard"
[12:20:25] <Nyture> and it works, if not in reverse
[12:20:25] <eddiemonge> kanzie: this should have been covered in your class. what book are you using?
[12:21:01] <kanzie> eddiemonge: well, I don't know if Im having a brainfart or something here cause I don't see what the problem is really.
[12:21:13] <kanzie> Im sure it will be obvious if you point it out
[12:21:40] <Nyture> seems the onclick command isnt triggering till the second time the faux button is clicked
[12:21:54] <herbySk> eddiemonge: it is a matter of point of view... what was that about jquery 2.0 won't ever be there? is it to stop as feature-full as mochikit did a year ago?
[12:22:29] <eddiemonge> herbySk: no. there is no point in a 2.0. there is no need to completely rewrite the code
[12:22:46] <eddiemonge> new features are added in major point releases and bug fixes in minor point releases
[12:23:55] <herbySk> eddiemonge: aha you mean there will be 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, ... all just incrementally adding upon existing one?
[12:24:11] <ryannneufeld> herbySk: that's what he means
[12:26:01] <herbySk> (well, as I see, jQuery API is changing, too; look at .on in 1.7 which is favoured over older ones; so I thought jQuery may deprecate, as well: those who depend on older API can still use older versions; I don't know what policy jQuery has on this (occasionally throw away older things)
[12:26:05] <herbySk> )
[12:26:35] <eddiemonge> herbySk: historically, stuff never went away. but thats changing with 1.7 on
[12:26:57] <eddiemonge> but not in the sense you are thinking of
[12:27:01] <kanzie> eddiemonge: I mean making a function and returning the private _users-var works but then I have to access it using () which I'd prefer not to
[12:27:26] <eddiemonge> kanzie: have you learned about "New" yet?
[12:28:00] <kanzie> eddiemonge: well yeah, but not using the new keyword in any of my code
[12:33:57] <last1> this is weird
[12:34:09] <last1> trying to attach an event to a dynamically created select
[12:34:20] <last1> .bind() does not work, .on() does not work but .live() works
[12:35:01] <last1> I thought .live() was deprecated and .on will follow
[12:37:05] <jrockjiggz> does anyone know about IE not being able to .load() fragment content?
[12:38:59] <jrockjiggz> ah nm
[12:40:08] <KJake> Hmm I noticed something quite disturbing on my webpage. I am using horizontal slider content on my web page, which works fine ... I just noticed that when I am using the TAB key, it iterates through my page elements like it usually does, but when I hit tab enough, it will also tab to content that is hidden from the screen (it's not on display: none, just not visible on the screen) making my scrolling content only show up partially. How
[12:40:33] <KJake> and I mean removing only this particular tabbing behaviour, not the whole tabbing behaviour as I'd still like to be able to tab in between form input fields for example
[12:40:49] <eddiemonge> last1: because you arent using .on() correctly. or else you arent using 1.7
[12:40:56] <ravenzz> jrockjiggz you should be more specific
[12:41:11] <ravenzz> and perhaps give us a demo
[12:41:23] <eddiemonge> KJake: overflow: hidden?
[12:41:52] <eddiemonge> kanzie: maybe this will give you an idea http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/rjNsW/4/
[12:42:35] <KJake> eddiemonge: I already have overflow hidden on my rotator container
[12:42:53] <ravenzz> demo?
[12:43:22] <kanzie> eddiemonge: so by referencing the public var I can manipulate content, but not by direct reference?
[12:43:32] <ravenzz> KJake disable the focus() event for the children
[12:43:56] <ravenzz> prevent the default action, so It won't select them
[12:44:23] <KJake> ravenzz: how would I do this?
[12:44:33] <last1> eddiemonge: I am using 1.7
[12:44:47] <ryannneufeld> ?demo @ last1
[12:44:47] <bot-t> last1, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[12:44:51] <last1> the only way I got it to work was through delegation
[12:45:09] <last1> aka: $("#div_contain").on('change', 'select', function...
[12:45:22] <eddiemonge> last1: thats what i said to do a long time ago
[12:45:29] <last1> $("#sel1").on('change', function...) did not work
[12:45:41] <KJake> ravenzz: create a global unbind() for all children for focus?
[12:45:47] <last1> ok, but why wouldn't straight on() work on sel1 right after sel1 was created ?
[12:45:57] <last1> from all that I read it should be working
[12:46:01] <last1> hell, live() works on it
[12:46:06] <eddiemonge> kanzie: you can use the functions name. your class should have covered this. if not, read http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752 and its covered in like chapter 3
[12:46:39] <eddiemonge> last1: live will work on any element at any time. on() has to be added after the element is added
[12:46:48] <last1> which is what I was doing
[12:46:56] <eddiemonge> so i dont think you were calling it correctly but with code i cant tell if thats true
[12:47:00] <eddiemonge> without
[12:47:13] <guy> wow. that's nice example of documentation. I wish everyone followed it.
[12:47:14] <guy> http://www.highcharts.com/stock/ref/#chart--alignTicks
[12:48:40] <kanzie> eddiemonge: so I should create a var in the beginning of the function for this then, like a self=this to avoid having to type the full namespace every time? Or does this refer to window?
[12:49:08] <ravenzz> KJake something like this http://jsfiddle.net/j3rEy/
[12:49:36] <minna1> Is there any way i can monitor if a page element is changed by ajax?
[12:49:38] <ravenzz> but I would take a look at your code before to implement that solution
[12:49:58] <eddiemonge> kanzie: no, this refers to the var but that doesnt work
[12:50:05] <eddiemonge> minna1: not easily
[12:50:18] <ravenzz> KJake http://jsfiddle.net/j3rEy/1/
[12:50:21] <KJake> ravenzz: so what you are doing is basically "rerouting" the focus
[12:50:28] <eddiemonge> guy: are you serious?
[12:50:31] <minna1> eddiemonge: Is is because it has to "bubble"?
[12:50:33] <ravenzz> use the tab to navigate that anchors
[12:50:40] <guy> eddiemonge: of course.
[12:50:53] <ravenzz> yep forwarding the focus to the next 'a'
[12:50:54] <eddiemonge> guy:  um ok. then i disagree
[12:51:30] <guy> eddiemonge: may I ask why? I don't mean the actual "documentation". I mean the interface/navigation, just in case.
[12:51:43] <KJake> ravenzz: might be a nice workaround indeed, didn't think of that :p ... should be easy enough to implement when I just hand it my rotator sections to skip
[12:52:32] <eddiemonge> minna1: huh?
[12:52:58] <eddiemonge> guy: thats very extJS-ish. its great if you are a machine, but as a human its not so easy
[12:53:17] <ravenzz> KJake anyway there should be a better solution! but I don't know what is your code
[12:53:19] <guy> do not compute.
[12:53:23] <minna1> eddiemonge: change, click, keyup etc.. bubbles
[12:54:29] <eddiemonge> minna1: i dont understand what you are asking
[12:55:16] <minna1> eddiemonge: Nevermind, thanks for replying :-)
[12:57:01] <ravenzz> she is asking if there is a way to monitor which DOM element change after an ajax request
[12:57:33] <minna1> ravenzz: Correct, i need to re-run a non-bubbling function once the content changed.
[12:58:13] <minna1> ravenzz: For example .each(), using .live and .on are easy for click, change etc, but not .each()
[12:58:31] <Nyture> what would cause a onclick command not to fire the first time, but repeated times work (essentially reversing the effect)
[12:59:06] <KJake> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/mSeHw/1/ ... it's just the html, but that's the basic structure of my rotator I guess
[12:59:07] <LSymonds> Nyture: Can you post your code (pastie.org).
[12:59:17] <Nyture> or, better yet, how would I go about debugging it?
[12:59:20] <ravenzz> minna1 well basically you can add your 'non-bubbling' function on the ajax callback
[12:59:44] <Nyture> alright, but its not pretty
[12:59:52] <Nyture> http://pastie.org/2858510
[12:59:54] <KJake> ravenzz: thing is, there's only one child of #rotatorcontent visible on the screen, to view other sections of #rotatorcontent the navigation is used in combination with scrollTo()
[13:00:31] <minna1> ravenzz: I would, but it's a cms script that calls the ajax, and i cannot change that.
[13:09:15] <Nyture> LSymonds any clue?
[13:09:55] <LSymonds> Not at the minute Nyture.
[13:10:02] <LSymonds> It's a bit messy so having to decode it ;)
[13:13:02] <Nyture> I said it wasnt pretty lol
[13:13:56] <Nyture> how would you go about finding out the reasn of the delay?
[13:14:06] <Nyture> Im assuming console in firebug
[13:16:07] <minna1> ravenzz: i could just re-declare the function from the js script from the CMS, but then if they change that function, the page would probably break.
[13:17:27] <minna1> ravenzz: I just found the livequery plugin and it does just what i need :-)
[13:20:29] <ravenzz> yep I was trying to remember that name ;)
[13:21:00] <minna1> ravenzz: I wonder why this feature haven't been added to 1.7
[13:21:24] <minna1> ravenzz: thanks for helping out again :-)
[13:21:46] <ravenzz> eh I dunno, yw
[13:34:10] <Dave_Stein> anyone have any idea how fast $(':data(whatever)') runs?
[13:34:42] <khmer> Dave_Stein: jsperf.com makes it easy to test things like that!
[13:35:11] <Dave_Stein> khmer: it's hard to say for that cause even if i do a perf with 100 divs, its not so practical for a real page
[13:35:39] <Dave_Stein> i'd imagine it was slow anyway, cause it's not something native as far as i know
[13:35:42] <Dave_Stein> i guess that's my real question :)
[13:35:43] <khmer> Dave_Stein: it depends on the use case
[13:36:34] <khmer> Dave_Stein: .data() is not exactly native, in that the data is not stored in the DOM. HTML5 supports the data- attribute prefix to create arbitrary attributes, which can then be used by attribute selectors or DOM manipulations. but jQuery.data uses its own cache outside the DOM.
[13:37:16] <Dave_Stein> so i if I run that selector, does its cache already have a map of that selector?
[13:37:24] <Dave_Stein> like it won't need to run through the dom cause its in its own cache right
[13:37:42] <Dave_Stein> cause if that's the case it should be pretty fast :)
[13:37:52] <khmer> i'm not sure, but i think since it's a selector, it's the property of sizzle
[13:37:53] <Dragoon> I'm off for today! Have a nice day/afternoon/night ya all! :)
[13:39:11] <minna1> Dragoon: the same to you :)
[13:39:39] <Dave_Stein> khmer: just looked at source and it doesn't seem to run through sizzle
[13:39:47] <Dave_Stein> getByName = typeof name === "string",
[13:39:48] <khmer> well then you're probably in luck
[13:39:59] <Dave_Stein> then if thats true
[13:39:59] <Dave_Stein> ret = thisCache[ name ];
[13:40:17] <Dave_Stein> yup it seems that way
[13:41:12] <minna1> is there any site where i can see performance between libraries?
[13:41:37] <khmer> minna1: jserf.com!
[13:41:40] <khmer> oh god
[13:41:41] <khmer> jsperf
[13:41:45] <Dave_Stein> hahaha
[13:41:48] <Dave_Stein> its a jsperf kinda day
[13:41:49] <Dave_Stein> :)
[13:41:55] <khmer> i'm a jserf
[13:41:58] <minna1> between libraries... not on a specific script on the current browser. geesh
[13:42:07] <khmer> i hope to one day be a jvassal
[13:42:09] <Dave_Stein> minna1 you can do it there too
[13:42:20] <Dave_Stein> minna1 just load multiple libraries in noConflict mode
[13:42:21] <minna1> yeah, but i have to create it :)
[13:42:32] <minna1> i meant in general, if there is such a case ;)
[13:42:35] <Dave_Stein> minna1: the answer is already jquery unless someone came out of nowhere
[13:42:43] <Dave_Stein> minna1: that's what got me to using it in the first place
[13:42:52] <Dave_Stein> minna1: and i haven't heard any arguments otherwise
[13:42:54] <minna1> Speed?
[13:42:59] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[13:43:17] <minna1> Nice, then there's nothing new to know :-D
[13:43:24] <minna1> *about that area.
[13:43:36] <Dave_Stein> if another libary became faster im sure there'd be a lot of buzz on the net
[13:44:05] <khmer> minna1: yeah, just inject the library and test how long it takes to load
[13:44:05] <minna1> Probably
[13:44:06] <Nyture> anyone know of some documentation regarding click events not triggering the first time? google isnt yielding any results.
[13:44:24] <Dave_Stein> click events will always trigger the first time if they are triggered when dom is ready
[13:45:34] <Nyture> how do you ensure the dom is ready?
[13:45:59] <minna1> Nyture: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:46:54] <Nyture> ok thought so
[13:48:33] <muhoo> so, why would, say, fullcalendar have a calling convention like $('#calendar').fullCalendar('next') instead of $('#calendar').fullCalendar.next() ?
[13:48:40] <Nyture> still, dom is ready, and onclick isnt triggering
[13:48:45] <Nyture> not till the second time
[13:52:14] <napperjabber> with the jq-accordian, how can you start it collapsed?
[13:52:17] <napperjabber> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#collapsible
[13:56:04] <KJake> Is there a way to ignore focus() events for specific selectors in jquery?
[14:00:53] <Nyture> hmmm
[14:01:16] <Nyture> would a .click() (jquery) interfere with a onclick="" (html)
[14:04:59] <amh345> i cant get tabIndex =-1 to have an effect on a radio button in IE.    can someone have a quick peek at this and tell my if my syntax is correct? http://jsfiddle.net/GAU6V/

[14:58:34] <knightbattle> Hi
[14:59:33] <bboyrman> hey guys, for jquery events namespace, can it be something like: click.namespace.subNamespace?
[14:59:38] <Falcon> hey, i have a draggable connected to a sortable list, now when i drop it i'd like the list to sometimes reject it basing on boolean isOK variable state
[14:59:50] <coldhead> puuuunch
[15:00:11] <bboyrman> (lol)
[15:00:15] <Falcon> i've tried ui.item.remove(), $(this).remove(), ui.helper.remove() but they're all not the drroped element
[15:00:25] <Falcon> any ideas?
[15:00:26] <minna1> coldhead: sounds good, i like punch :-)
[15:01:59] <coldhead> Falcon: i believe you want to call the revert method inside the drop handler
[15:02:45] <Falcon> rev.. what revert() method?
[15:02:52] <Falcon> i can't see it in sortable's documentation
[15:03:16] <Falcon> nor in draggable's
[15:06:17] <coldhead> i'm misleading you, Falcon
[15:06:20] <coldhead> revert is an option
[15:06:30] <coldhead> the first answer here might be helpful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4302882/jquery-draggable-revert-based-on-condition
[15:06:54] <Falcon> afaik revert only enables a nice animation
[15:09:27] <Falcon> hmm
[15:09:38] <Falcon> i've never thought to bind a callback to accept option
[15:10:10] <Falcon> though dunno if this will work in my specific case
[15:10:55] <Falcon> as it's like i drag element to the list->drop it->a nice dialog pops up->basing of what happen in dialog i decide if i want that doppable to stay on list or not->here's my problem
[15:11:37] <Falcon> however that can be simplified to the fact that what i want to achive is i want to make jquery tree plugin editable
[15:11:47] <coldhead> that stack overflow answer should work
[15:11:57] <coldhead> it can take as long as it needs to make up its mind
[15:12:09] <coldhead> as long as your popup is blocking
[15:12:17] <amh345> i cant get tabIndex =-1 to have an effect on a radio button in IE.    can someone have a quick peek at this and tell my if my syntax is correct? http://jsfiddle.net/GAU6V/
[15:12:17] <Falcon> should be
[15:12:58] <Falcon> though i'm not sure if recieve is called before or after accept
[15:13:27] <coldhead> tabIndex is weird
[15:13:34] <coldhead> i can't imagine what -1 is supposed to do
[15:14:01] <Spadeski> sup coldhead
[15:14:46] <ajpiano> tabindex -1 is "focusable but not in the tab order" iirc
[15:14:55] <Falcon> also i'm not sure if sortable has an accept option at all
[15:16:01] <Falcon> maybe let's put it other way: does anyone knows a nice JQuery plugin for an AJAX file tree?
[15:16:06] <Falcon> with edit options
[15:17:55] <amh345> ok, so no ideas on the IE thing with tab index?    is input[type=radio]  the correct syntax for a radio?
[15:30:11] <Falcon> meh, well, i solved it with selecting my dropped item by class in recieve event
[15:30:23] <Falcon> it's damn late here now, i'll seek for some more elegant solution tomorrow
[15:30:39] <Falcon> (accept option doesn't work in case of sortables)
[15:30:41] <Falcon> good night
[15:31:57] <amh345> err.. how do i add a target to window.location = "xyz.com" ?
[15:44:50] <VeXii> window.location += "#sup" can do it
[15:54:03] <Gorkyman> how do I "connect" form data to ajax() call?
[16:11:53] <DaVault> hello everyone! any help would be greatly appreciated. i'm having trouble trying to filter a list  of images that are loaded on the fly. i'm getting them through a proxy via curl and then putting them in a div and using waitforimages plugin to try and filter out images that are too small or rectangular. problem is its not working unless the browser cache is clear! any help?
[16:15:49] <diegoviola> hi
[16:15:54] <diegoviola> does jquery has something for websockets?
[16:16:01] <diegoviola> like it does for ajax
[16:18:18] <diegoviola> different things i guess
[16:18:29] <VeXii> no, not i know. only used it whith socket.io
[16:18:57] <VeXii> i dont think thay get it as you need to use flash for fallback support
[16:19:24] <diegoviola> thanks
[16:19:31] <diegoviola> i'll look at socket.io
[16:20:18] <VeXii> you need node to work it
[16:21:05] <diegoviola> k
[16:21:12] <diegoviola> thx
[16:27:03] <Ali> Hiya
[16:32:51] <k1ng> Why can't you call split() twice?
[16:34:08] <VeXii> you can call it 2 times on strings
[16:34:53] <VeXii> you cant do var a = "foo".split(""); a.split("")
[16:35:48] <GranMal> Hi all ... I'm looking for a way to check to see if there are 3 duplicate entries in an array ... If there are, I want to display an alert ... Is there a built in jquery function that will do that?
[16:39:25] <VeXii> GranMal you can do it whith recursion and indexOf
[16:41:06] <GranMal> VeXii: I'll check into that ... I think I found a solution. Thanks.
[16:41:21] <VeXii> what did you end up doing?
[16:42:11] <GranMal> I'm coding it right now ... I'll show it off in a bit.
[16:42:17] <VeXii> okay :)
[17:12:26] <amh345> hi guys. im having a huge nightmarish problem.  i have a form that's split in 2. you see one div/side and than hit next and you see the other div.    but pressing tab is prematurely advancing the form causing my layout to get completely messed up
[17:12:54] <Nyture> url?
[17:13:18] <amh345> i've set tabindex -1 (using js) for all the fields. but the radio buttons seem to ignore tab index in IE.
[17:13:21] <hoganlong> amh345 - what are you using that causes tab to act like hitting next?
[17:13:42] <hasanibrahim> hello, when i add a swf code (banner )on my site with a jquery gallery, banner's urls are not working, while they are working in another pages..
[17:14:18] <amh345> hoganlong: it's not acting like the next button. it's just moving the div over just enough to see the other radio buttons.   it's not a full 100% slide.
[17:14:24] <hoganlong> hasanibrahim -- I doubt that is jQuery -- probably relative url problem.
[17:15:04] <hoganlong> amh345 - I see.   Can you disable the other radios till next is pressed?
[17:15:10] <Flam> amh345 I don't know if I'm misunderstanding you but you are supposed to set tabindex=1 or 2 or 3 in order of the things you want to tab to
[17:15:30] <hoganlong> flam - -1 should cause them to not be tabbable.
[17:16:03] <hasanibrahim> hoganlong: banners buttons (urls ) are working in all other pages. but when i try to use it with a jquery gallery, banners urls are not working, interestingly..
[17:17:00] <hoganlong> hasanibrahim - but shockwave does not use flash so what is the deal... how could jquery matter.
[17:17:21] <hoganlong> hasanibrahim -EDIT but shockwave does not use javascript so what is the deal... how could jquery matter.
[17:18:45] <hasanibrahim> hoganlong: i'm sure you're right, but it's really interesting that jquery blocks swf file's urls..
[17:19:34] <hoganlong> hasanibrahim -- It's a dirty rumor spread by adobe employees I tell you!
[17:19:45] <hoganlong> ok I'll fix it if you send me url
[17:19:54] <amh345> hoganlong: i cant disable them.  it's maddening.  it works on all other form feilds.    i was peeking around jquery tools.  i found something that worked for me.     event.keyCode == 9 {event.prevdefau
[17:20:01] <amh345> man. im lagging like crazy.
[17:20:35] <hoganlong> amh345 -- great you found a solution!
[17:22:00] <amh345> thanks :)
[17:23:32] <GoSox> So when using the jquery form plugin, is it possible for me to get the ID of the submit button that was used to submit a form to .ajaxForm() ?
[17:23:45] <GoSox> (i'm using forms that have two submit buttons, each performing a different function
[17:24:15] <Nyture> can anyone explain why the onclick code wont fire until the second time the red box is clicked? (I apologize, the code is accurate but jsfiddle doesnt seem to want to run it. Regardless, its all there and working shy of the onclick issue)
[17:24:16] <Nyture> http://jsfiddle.net/
[17:24:19] <Nyture> gah
[17:24:25] <Nyture> http://jsfiddle.net/K4pPh/
[17:26:01] <GoSox> Nyture: isn't .checkbox defining a class? your input has no class
[17:26:14] <minna> Darn, doesn't seem possible to monitor DOM for changes with javascript at all :-S
[17:27:43] <ryanseddon> minna: mutation events
[17:28:09] <vdt> does jquery provide any tcp socket funcionality? If no, what would be a good way to acquire data in realtime from the server with low overhead cos I dont like the way ajax work making a http request everytime when there will be a lot of requests per second and I want to optimize bandwidth usage
[17:28:13] <minna> ryanseddon: Yeah, that's what i read up on. Unfortunately it does not work cross-browser by a long shot.
[17:28:50] <minna> vdt: Not that i know of, i think it's too high-level language for that.
[17:29:04] <tom__> vdt: http is a very lightweight protocol and servers for it are highly optimized and performant
[17:29:13] <Nyture> .checkbox is a inserted element
[17:29:24] <minna> vdt: basically limited to the http client.
[17:29:31] <tom__> you're unlikely to do significantly better with your own protocol
[17:30:00] <hoganlong> vdt - ajax with json is quite effient -- only going to get better if you write a c program
[17:30:12] <minna> if performance is the issue, it may help to use nginx instead of apache.
[17:30:32] <minna> or even use node.js that has non-locking threads.
[17:30:40] <Flam> stick to nginx
[17:30:42] <tom__> node.js is good
[17:30:51] <minna> node.js is amazing :)
[17:30:52] <hoganlong> vdt - or a design that does not make lots of requests a second.
[17:31:02] <minna> but not that mature (feature wise)
[17:31:02] <tom__> but really, these are seldom the performance limiters
[17:31:13] <vdt> alright thanks guys I'll give a try =)
[17:31:13] <minna> tom__: agreed
[17:31:18] <tom__> filesystem and access and database are bigger
[17:31:29] <Nyture> anyone know why that code is preventing the first click (or more accurately, delaying the click)
[17:31:34] <minna> oh yes. i/o killed the server
[17:32:08] <minna> delaying?!
[17:32:18] <minna> maybe you have a loop?
[17:33:01] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/DRc7D/4/  - i need some help. If i put height: 10000px in div.mask, the scroll works, but i want to have height: 100% and it does not scroll....
[17:33:05] <ryanseddon> minna: yeah you can use do very simple support for mutation with the propertychange event in <IE8
[17:34:08] <minna> ryanseddon: this project is for a responsive website, so i will try and avoid using mutations instead.
[17:34:19] <ryanseddon> minna: but yes the support is spotty at best
[17:34:55] <vdt> if you guys could help me to figure this out: I'll be receiving the data that I have to make available to the browser in a java server so I guess writing in a xml file everytime some data arives isnt a good idea
[17:35:05] <vdt> there must be a better way
[17:35:05] <minna> i noticed a few issues with .html().replace() today also, in some situations it doesnt work in IE7-8
[17:36:06] <minna> vdt: im guessing you'r already offloading a lot on the client using cookies and localstorage?
[17:36:31] <hoganlong> vdt : json is much faster than xml
[17:36:59] <minna> json can be difficult at first, but it's worth it
[17:37:24] <necromancer> minna: try caching it to a var and then doing .replace() on that.
[17:37:50] <minna> necromancer: That's exacly what i did.
[17:38:00] <necromancer> minna: .split('search').join('replace') is easier on the processor anyway
[17:38:01] <necromancer> try that
[17:38:11] <minna> necromancer: Wait, i'll find the fiddle.
[17:38:13] <necromancer> i know it works in IE 7/8
[17:38:22] <minna> necromancer: no worries, i used .map instead to change the code properly.
[17:38:30] <minna> necromancer: still, there's still a bug somewhere.
[17:38:50] <vdt> thanks a lot
[17:39:03] <minna> necromancer: it's probbaly a rare case, what i did is not a good thing to do obviously.
[17:40:12] <minna> necromancer: http://jsfiddle.net/KA2jL/
[17:41:13] <Nyture> minna: no loop, just looks like the .click() is prevents the onclick="" from executing the first time
[17:41:24] <Nyture> *is preventing
[17:41:55] <minna> Nyture: you have a .click and a onclick? why?
[17:42:32] <Nyture> http://jsfiddle.net/K4pPh/ - faux buttons for cleaner forms
[17:43:03] <Nyture> the onclick in the html is by another developer
[17:43:44] <Nyture> irregardless, extracting the onclick code and doing eval()  on it has the same issue
[17:43:54] <Nyture> so I think its an interferance with the click command
[17:44:01] <minna> Nyture: you can disable the onclick event by using event.preventDefault(); since you don't need it.
[17:44:47] <minna> Nyture: try using .live and see if it's faster, i noticed .on have to be used differently sometimes.
[17:45:00] <Nyture> its not an issue of speed
[17:45:37] <minna> Nyture: nothing happens when i click the red triangle in your fiddle.
[17:45:40] <Nyture> as a matter of fact, .live() breaks my script for some reason
[17:46:05] <Nyture> minna: yea, thats got me buggered to, but I think its a jsfiddle thing. My code works fine shy of the 2nd click problem
[17:46:54] <minna> Nyture: there is a much cleaner way to do this by the way.
[17:47:12] <minna> Nyture: Just a sec
[17:47:40] <minna> Nyture: http://jsbin.com/uwuje/edit#javascript,html
[17:48:38] <minna> bbl, phone.
[17:49:00] <Nyture> thanks for the uhhh "help"
[17:58:35] <BlankVerse> any image gallery plugin using jquery which looks similar to google+ ?
[17:58:49] <k1ng> table.WSGTableResults tbody tr
[17:59:09] <k1ng> why its doesnt work tr on tbody?
[17:59:16] <BlankVerse> with features like infinite scrolling and variable size thumbnails
[18:13:04] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/DRc7D/4/  - i need some help. If i put height: 10000px in div.mask, the scroll works, but i want to have height: 100% and it does not scroll....
[18:21:59] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: it scrolls for me
[18:22:28] <xnotte> ryannneufeld: in what browser
[18:22:38] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: you want it to scroll? or not to scroll?
[18:22:54] <ryannneufeld> also, try #css
[18:23:18] <xnotte> i want it to scroll with width: 100%, but it only works if i put like width: 10000px
[18:23:32] <hoganlong> to scroll or not to scroll that is the question
[18:23:45] <hoganlong> whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
[18:23:51] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: well, no duh
[18:23:59] <hoganlong> the sling and arrows of outrageous mousing
[18:24:06] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: you have overflow hidden
[18:24:31] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: /join #css
[18:25:06] <xnotte> i'm in css, but i thought that was a jquery problem
[18:25:27] <xnotte> ryannneufeld: the overflow hidden does not influence
[18:25:51] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: overflow controls wether or not to scroll
[18:27:21] <knightbattle> hi there
[18:27:24] <xnotte> ryannneufeld: if you change it in jsfiddle you'll see that has no influence
[18:31:32] <ryannneufeld> be that as it may, this still smells like a css problem to me
[18:32:01] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: also I do see a horizontal scroll bar
[18:32:06] <ryannneufeld> I just have to scroll down to see it
[18:33:18] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: also, you don't need the head or body tags
[18:33:23] <ryannneufeld> in jsfiddle
[18:33:24] <ryannneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/DRc7D/5/
[18:34:03] <xnotte> ryannneufeld: ok. whats the problem with the scroll bar'
[18:34:31] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: what is it that you're expecting width 100% to be?
[18:34:36] <ryannneufeld> 100% of what?
[18:34:41] <xnotte> of the window
[18:34:48] <ryannneufeld> That's what you're getting
[18:35:21] <ryannneufeld> why would it scroll, if it's the width of the window?
[18:35:46] <xnotte> i want the mask only to be the width of the window
[18:36:16] <ryannneufeld> mhmm
[18:37:16] <xnotte> because it's how i determine the width in different resolutions
[18:39:44] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: yeah it's a css issue alright
[18:39:55] <ryannneufeld> you have overflow set on html, body WTF is with that?
[18:40:48] <ryannneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/DRc7D/6/ Scrolls fine now
[18:45:21] <xnotte> ryannneufeld: what was the problem ?
[18:45:30] <ryannneufeld> you have overflow set on html, body WTF is with that?
[18:45:40] <ryannneufeld> ;)
[18:45:58] <ryannneufeld> oh, one other thing
[18:46:05] <ryannneufeld> that inline-block is probably messing w/ you too
[18:47:52] <ryannneufeld> I take that back
[18:47:56] <ryannneufeld> inline block is fine
[18:48:00] <xnotte> ryannneufeld: i've removed the overflow_ hidden, but i need it, to not show scroll bars
[18:48:00] <xnotte> you've
[18:49:23] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: okay, but then you can't scroll the content
[18:49:32] <ryannneufeld> so the page is useless
[18:49:49] <ryannneufeld> unless you want to use javascript to do the scrolling for you
[18:49:57] <xnotte> ryannneufeld: if i put the width ate 10000px, i can scroll it, and with overflow hidden
[18:50:22] <ryannneufeld> right
[18:50:37] <ryannneufeld> cause width 100% is 100% of the content
[18:50:54] <ryannneufeld> or wait, I dunno
[18:50:57] <ryannneufeld> I'm guessing here
[18:51:05] <ryannneufeld> the guys in #css would be better to ask
[18:51:23] <xnotte> ok i'll ask it there
[18:51:30] <xnotte> thank you for your help
[18:54:00] <ryannneufeld> xnotte: sorry I couldnt be of better help man
[18:54:31] <xnotte> ryannneufeld: you've been enough ;)
[18:54:34] <xnotte> thanks
[18:54:41] <ryannneufeld> daw shucks
[19:29:15] <krz> how can i round 87.1234 to 87.12

[19:45:32] <coldhead> aids aids aids
[19:52:36] <dimsum> hey guys. I'm using load to dynamically change the <option> from a <select>. It functions normally but when the form submits the values of those <option> is not passed thru. How come?
[19:53:56] <jovrtn> dimsum: how are you changing the selected <option> ?
[19:54:07] <dimsum> using load()
[19:54:27] <jovrtn> what's the code you're using to actually change the option itself
[19:56:06] <dimsum> @jovrtn: http://jsfiddle.net/aUccE/
[19:58:44] <jovrtn> dimsum: can you walk me through how this is supposed to work?
[20:00:06] <dimsum> initially the select will only have one option
[20:00:54] <dimsum> at the document ready a set of option is loaded using load()
[20:01:06] <dimsum> the form has two select boxes
[20:01:40] <dimsum> each time the first select box changed, the option of the second select box is changed dynamically using load also.
[20:01:45] <dimsum> something like that
[20:03:20] <jovrtn> how your .load() line works within the change() callback
[20:03:43] <jovrtn> is that it's grabbing the result of your php and inserting it into the 'nama-cabang' <select> element
[20:03:57] <dimsum> yes that's right
[20:04:15] <jovrtn> so it's returning valid html, a list of <option> elements
[20:04:21] <dimsum> yup
[20:04:28] <jovrtn> but there's nothing telling that second list which of them needs to be set as the selected option
[20:04:41] <jovrtn> if that's what you want
[20:05:01] <dimsum> hmmm. maybe you're right
[20:05:33] <jovrtn> and I'm not sure what calling change() a second time is accomplishing
[20:05:43] <dimsum> me too, i saw it in a website
[20:05:59] <jovrtn> I would take it out for now
[20:06:01] <dimsum> but it's working the dropdown itself
[20:06:44] <jovrtn> it's causing your code to be run twice
[20:06:48] <dimsum> ic
[20:06:49] <jovrtn> which doesn't seem like what you want
[20:06:59] <dimsum> lemme change that
[20:07:31] <jovrtn> so I take it the load() is working and the second <select> is being populated with <option> elements
[20:07:48] <jovrtn> what does it look like after that happens? does the second <select> have an option selected at all?
[20:08:44] <dimsum> jovrtn: can i pm you jovrtn ?
[20:08:49] <ReastDaBeast> Please Please check out my Gaming channel http://www.youtube.com/user/ReastDaBeastGaming
[20:08:50] <jovrtn> sure
[20:24:16] <ChrisPartridge> Is this valid with jQuery: $('#container').append([$('<span>a</span>'), $('<span>b</span>')]); ?
[20:30:46] <jedimind> is there a relatively straight forward way to detect over what element the mouse currently is? assuming i am not using a mouseover event obv
[20:38:51] <jrockjiggz> hover() ?
[20:39:31] <jovrtn> is there an event that triggers the position checking?
[20:41:01] <jrockjiggz> position?
[20:41:04] <jrockjiggz> ?position
[20:41:05] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[20:42:57] <jovrtn> jrockjiggz: for example, if I have a .click() event on a div, I can check the click even't even.target property to see what html node actually received the event
[20:47:06] <echoSMILE> $(".hasDatepicker").datepicker is not a function <- what Im doing wrong?
[20:48:10] <echoSMILE> the code: $(document).ready(function() { $(".hasDatepicker").datepicker(); });
[20:48:18] <jovrtn> echoSMILE: make sure you're including whatever datepicker script you're using after jquery
[20:48:49] <echoSMILE> jovrtn: well, it is after.
[20:50:01] <jovrtn> echoSMILE: so you're including the jquery.js script first, then the datepacker.js script second in your html file?
[20:50:44] <echoSMILE> jquery.js first, then jquerygui after
[20:50:58] <echoSMILE> jquerygui is the default code.
[20:51:00] <jovrtn> I'd make sure to check your paths to those
[20:51:13] <jovrtn> make sure they're being included properly, that there're no 404s
[20:51:23] <echoSMILE> let me check
[20:53:37] <echoSMILE> jovrtn: oh ok. two calls for jquery.js before and after jquerygui. now, no error. but, datapicket dont open.
[20:53:56] <jovrtn> depending on the script, you may need a stylesheet included
[20:54:07] <jovrtn> I know jqueryUI uses a theme stylesheet to style its datepicker
[20:54:18] <jovrtn> and it won't show up unless you style it yourself
[20:54:21] <jovrtn> (or include theirs)
[20:54:39] <echoSMILE> Im already include theirs.
[20:54:43] <echoSMILE> let me check again
[20:55:13] <echoSMILE> <link href="/media/js/jquery/theme/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
[20:55:16] <echoSMILE> yep I am
[20:55:35] <jovrtn> and that's linked properly, no 404?
[20:56:18] <echoSMILE> yep, the file exists.
[20:56:39] <jovrtn> well hmm
[20:58:07] <jovrtn> the datepicker default is to appear when you've focused the input element
[20:58:28] <echoSMILE> jovrtn: Im using the slider() and the GUI appear nice.
[20:58:31] <jovrtn> so if you're using the date picker some other way (like triggering when you click a non-input element) you'll have to set that up differently
[20:58:36] <echoSMILE> jovrtn: like onclick right?
[20:59:19] <echoSMILE> Im trying use the default behavior. on click, he appear.
[20:59:23] <jovrtn> echoSMILE: you can trigger the date picker appearing with: $(element).datepicker( "show" )
[20:59:38] <jovrtn> is .hasDatepicker a text input element?
[20:59:39] <jovrtn> or something else
[21:00:13] <echoSMILE> jovrtn: <input type='date'
[21:00:22] <jovrtn> err yeah
[21:01:43] <GoSox> how can I get the ID of the submit button when a form is submitted?
[21:02:04] <jovrtn> echoSMILE: http://jsfiddle.net/ovrtn/aUccE/1/  working just fine for me
[21:02:58] <echoSMILE> jovrtn: hum, after inside that 'show' now I get:
[21:03:00] <echoSMILE> a is undefined
[21:03:00] <echoSMILE> [Break On This Error] 0;f<a.length;f++)if(c)if(a.charAt(f)==...null,f,h;f=h=this._getDefaultDate(a);
[21:03:07] <echoSMILE> :/
[21:03:07] <nonotza> can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong here? http://pastebin.com/amWDmbJk ... I'm trying to get the json string's attribute
[21:03:15] <jovrtn> yikes
[21:03:16] <nonotza> from the data object
[21:03:52] <echoSMILE> s/inside/insert
[21:04:19] <jovrtn> nonotza: log the returned data object and make sure you're grabbing the right json properties
[21:04:24] <echoSMILE> jovrtn: Im using the last versions ('compressed')
[21:04:39] <nonotza> I am
[21:04:56] <jovrtn> nonotza: what sort of error are you getting?
[21:05:22] <nonotza> this is the content of data: {"state_is_nj":true}
[21:05:46] <echoSMILE> jovrtn: any idea?
[21:06:20] <jovrtn> echoSMILE: are you including any other scripts that could be interfering with it?
[21:06:50] <nonotza> I'm not getting any error - the if statement is just evaluating as false
[21:07:14] <echoSMILE> jovrtn: i dont think so
[21:07:50] <jovrtn> echoSMILE: it's working perfectly for me, I'd suggest taking out everything except the latest version of jquery and the latest version of jqueryUI and seeing what happens
[21:08:15] <echoSMILE> http://pastebin.com/ftZFYMVH
[21:08:19] <nonotza> jovrtn: when I do alert(data.state_is_nj); I get undefined
[21:08:42] <echoSMILE> i will try.
[21:08:55] <jovrtn> nonotza: have you used console logging before?
[21:09:28] <nonotza> yes
[21:10:00] <jovrtn> nonotza: try console.log(data)
[21:10:10] <jovrtn> maybe the json object is structured a bit differently than you expect
[21:10:18] <jovrtn> the state_is_nj property could be a level down
[21:10:21] <jovrtn> or something like that
[21:10:34] <nonotza> it's the key in the string
[21:10:40] <nonotza> *it's the only key
[21:10:41] <echoSMILE> jovrtn: see that: http://jsfiddle.net/TmXC4/
[21:11:27] <nonotza> console log: {"state_is_nj":true}
[21:11:59] <GoSox> i must be missing something
[21:12:17] <GoSox> i'm on jquery.com, on the forum, logged in... and I can NOT find a button anywhere to start a new post
[21:12:19] <GoSox> wth??
[21:13:42] <nonotza> jovrtn: ^^ any idea?
[21:14:48] <jovrtn> echoSMILE: that's really weird, it seems to be choking on your 'hasDatepicker' classname, change it to anything else and it works
[21:16:20] <echoSMILE> why that kind of things are always happening to me?
[21:16:23] <echoSMILE> tks :P
[21:16:28] <jovrtn> nonotza: try this: data['state_is_nj']
[21:16:32] <jovrtn> nonotza: instead of the dot notation
[21:16:42] <jovrtn> echoSMILE: np, that was a weird one, good luck :)
[21:18:10] <nonotza> jovertn: returns undefined
[21:18:13] <nonotza> :/
[21:18:38] <echoSMILE> :p ty again
[21:19:23] <Platz> hello all.  just curious if everyone is using json in data attributes, parsed w/ .data , or if it's kind of an obscure practice
[21:19:54] <jovrtn> nonotza: var obj = {"state_is_nj":true};  console.log(obj.state_is_nj);
[21:19:59] <jovrtn> nonotza: logging just fine for me
[21:20:16] <ajpiano> Platz: it's def a common practise
[21:20:29] <ajpiano> GoSox: try the words "New Post"
[21:20:30] <Platz> ajpiano: cool thanks
[21:20:45] <ajpiano> in the blue 2nd toolbar from the top
[21:21:00] <GoSox> oh way up tin the top! that's an odd place to put a new post type button
[21:21:25] <ajpiano> yah
[21:21:31] <ajpiano> agreed
[21:22:04] <GoSox> i honestly reloaded that page 5 times trying to find the post button
[21:22:08] <GoSox> that was weird
[21:23:06] <GoSox> when you click the submit button, can you count on $("#submit").click() running before $("#form").submit() happens?
[21:23:57] <jovrtn> GoSox: why would you need both?
[21:24:47] <GoSox> a form with multiple submit buttons, i'm trying to identify which submit button is pressed. I used to just do it server-side in the $_POST variable, but of course IE9 no longer adds the submit button to a submitted form, just to bust my balls
[21:25:05] <GoSox> so now i need to use jQuery to set the value of an invisible, to let PHP know which submit button was pressed
[21:25:51] <ajpiano> GoSox: set up a test page and test
[21:25:54] <ajpiano> typically yes
[21:26:42] <nonotza> i got it ... I needed to do this: jQuery.parseJSON(data);
[21:26:44] <ajpiano> i think there's also a property of the event object that you can access
[21:26:55] <ajpiano> inside of submit
[21:27:05] <jovrtn> nonotza: ahh
[21:27:20] <nonotza> newbie mistake I guess
[21:27:31] <jovrtn> nonotza: good thinking; you can also have your php script format the data as JSON
[21:27:53] <nonotza> I didn't know that
[21:28:02] <nonotza> I guess you are right
[21:28:24] <jovrtn> nonotza: something like: return json_encode($data)
[21:28:38] <jovrtn> but either way is fine as long as the string is getting JSON-ified
[21:28:48] <nonotza> cool

[21:51:28] <welder> Can someone help me find the problem in my jQuery plugin? I'm trying to convert some code that was working into a jQuery plugin finally...
[21:51:42] <welder> http://ahamlett.com/picasagallery.js
[21:51:59] <welder> being called from -> view-source:http://ahamlett.com/gallery.html
[21:53:15] <welder> it seems like the 'this' object in my $.fn.picasagallery function is empty
[21:59:00] <thebigkiwi> can someone point me in the right direction, im struggling with google. basically i have a full screen background, and i want a content block to expand or contract depending on the window/browser size
[21:59:23] <thebigkiwi> like this sorta - http://caravanonexmouth.co.uk/food-drink
[22:05:22] <welder> thebigkiwi: u want an element's size to be a percent of page width?
[22:05:34] <thebigkiwi> page height welder
[22:06:20] <thebigkiwi> eg, window size - footer+padding
[22:08:54] <radiantstatic> Does anyone know why my photo galleria plugin isn't working? I don't have any means of testing to see if the javascript for the slide action is conflicting. http://reelindie.com/wordpress
[22:10:10] <welder> thebigkiwi: you want the background to resize with the page or an element's height to resize with the page height?
[22:11:03] <thebigkiwi> i have the background resized, so now i want the content area to be a precent of that
[22:11:22] <thebigkiwi> like that example i sent, when you resize the window, the content area shrinks
[22:13:09] <welder> thebigkiwi: that example probably just sets the div or span, etc element that wraps the content to a percent
[22:13:28] <welder> i know that works for width, but for height
[22:13:45] <thebigkiwi> it uses this
[22:13:48] <thebigkiwi> var contentHeight = $.getDocHeight() - ($('#footer').height() + 15) - (26 + 15) - 80; // Height of window - (footer height + padding bottom) - (margin top of #aqueeze + padding top) - padding on .inside
[22:13:49] <thebigkiwi> $('#roastery #wrapper #container #center .inside').css({'height' : contentHeight});
[22:14:16] <welder> thebigkiwi: $(window).height();   // returns height of browser viewport
[22:14:35] <thebigkiwi> but i couldnt really get that to work right for my example, was wondering if there was a specific term i should be looking for, as a guide to these single window websites
[22:14:43] <GoSox> I just discovered something odd. I have a form that uses .ajaxForm() to submit the php document's output into a textarea. The php document outputs a string with some HTML entities (&amp; etc). It appears that jQuery is decoding these entities on the fly, and turning them back into their original elements before sending them to the text field
[22:15:31] <welder> GoSox: are you using IE to test? look up IE padding fix
[22:15:36] <welder> IE ajax padding fix
[22:15:38] <welder> something like that
[22:15:44] <GoSox> i'm testing in safari
[22:15:47] <welder> oh
[22:16:08] <GoSox> if i doublt-encode the string in php, htmlentities(htmlentities($string));
[22:16:18] <GoSox> jquery will decode once, and i'll get singly-encoded string
[22:16:25] <GoSox> that is very strange
[22:17:40] <coldhead> it's very awful
[22:17:52] <wowtux> hello all
[22:18:28] <GoSox> ah is it because i'm using .html instead of .text?
[22:18:34] <wowtux> having error "a is undefined" and my head is crazy already, can somebody help me?
[22:19:10] <GoSox> i'm submitting to a text area so i should switch it to .text anyway
[22:19:32] <GoSox> yup that fixed it
[22:21:28] <welder> GoSox: nice
[22:25:24] <welder> so anyone know why my plugin isn't getting passed the 'this' object when called from a div element?
[22:36:32] <welder> nevermind, had a typo
[22:38:12] <tregeagle> How can I make this hide everything except the last clicked on item? http://jsfiddle.net/tregeagle/N7f8v/1/
[22:38:38] <Stereo> hi everyone
[22:40:05] <Stereo> I have a bunch of <tr>'s with an input field inside, I'd like to hide the <tr> if the input field's value is empty
[22:41:56] <jovrtn> Stereo: http://jsfiddle.net/ovrtn/ymqgQ/
[22:41:59] <Stereo> and I've been trying different combinations for the last hour or so
[22:42:00] <Stereo> oh
[22:42:30] <Stereo> jovrtn: â™¥
[22:42:37] <jovrtn> Stereo: np!
[22:44:19] <Stereo> it works!
[22:44:24] <Stereo> thanks again
[22:44:32] <jovrtn> sure thing
[22:54:52] <deebo> is there a some way to monitor input fields content change so that i get an event every time the content changes
[22:55:02] <deebo> keyup is only viable until someone uses the mouse to paste something
[22:55:20] <deebo> or some browser functionality does autofill
[22:56:33] <Eviltwin> deebo: Have you looked at the "change" event?
[22:56:46] <deebo> Eviltwin: that only triggers when focus is lost
[22:56:46] <VeXii> wowtux: post on jsfiddle or somthing and i look it over while server is rebooting :)))
[22:58:12] <VeXii> deebo, cant you combine onBlur and onKeyup maybe?
[22:58:42] <VeXii> can pull the length of val() and compaire
[22:58:52] <deebo> a mouse paste wont trigger blur (?)
[22:59:15] <wowtux> VeXii, oh thx
[23:00:03] <deebo> weird that something like this doesnt exist out of the box, i just want an event every time the input fields content changes
[23:01:25] <VeXii> deebo: no youre right but then add in onClick to it :p
[23:02:03] <VeXii> focus,blur,keyUp,click/mouseenter-leave and youre asclosse to being coverd :P
[23:02:26] <VeXii> whith out going to do a setInterval(foo,100)
[23:02:53] <VeXii> (i dont think the setInterval is somthing you shod do thou ;D)
[23:03:19] <deebo> yeah guess i just need to bind all the cases ...
[23:04:34] <VeXii> just dont do the functions inline then :)
[23:06:39] <wowtux> VeXii, http://jsfiddle.net/EeqH4/
[23:06:44] <wowtux> VeXii, thx in advance
[23:08:50] <VeXii> superfish is undefined must be missing a plugin
[23:08:54] <deebo> anyone got an example for an event trigger filter like "don't actually execute event handler until x time from laste event" ?
[23:09:13] <wowtux> VeXii, i debug it is near feedUri variable , its is "a is undefined"
[23:09:30] <wowtux> VeXii, superfish is a error me , isnt neccesary this part of code to debug
[23:10:06] <BlankVerse> $.tmpl was it in older jquery version?
[23:10:23] <VeXii> no its from a plugin BlankVerse
[23:10:26] <BlankVerse> i am using jquery filupload-ui.js
[23:10:42] <BlankVerse> and i get this error
[23:10:43] <BlankVerse> Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)} has no method 'tmpl'

[23:11:59] <VeXii> wowtux: what is this superfish?
[23:12:17] <VeXii> BlankVerse: tmpl is from the jquery data templater plugin
[23:12:29] <wowtux> VeXii, superfish isnt neccesary
[23:12:39] <wowtux> VeXii, superfish is to built menus
[23:12:40] <VeXii> wowtux: well its throwing errors
[23:12:56] <coldhead> IT NO NECESSARY DEBUG TO THIS
[23:13:19] <wowtux> VeXii, http://jsfiddle.net/EeqH4/2/
[23:13:24] <wowtux> VeXii, without superfish
[23:13:46] <wowtux> VeXii, i find the problem , feedUri hasnt value
[23:13:58] <wowtux> VeXii, how to define feedUri global?
[23:16:23] <VeXii> just declare it out side the jquery function
[23:19:15] <coldhead> window.feedUri = 'whatever'
[23:20:24] <VeXii> or stick it on the window obj like coldhead says :)
[23:20:35] <wowtux> coldhead, oh thx i test it
[23:21:00] <VeXii> but wowtux: i think the error is arund youre google api calls. when i comment that out i get 0 errors (but ofc dunno if the rest is fireing)
[23:21:39] <Stereo> I have a button in a <tr>, and a hidden <tr> right underneath it. If I want to call toggle() from the button on the row underneath, how do I refer to it?
[23:22:19] <lazarus477> Question: I am using the corner plugin URL: http://www.malsup.com/jquery/corner/  I am unable to get a border such as in the "keep" demo example. Any ideas?
[23:22:55] <Stereo> in other words, how do I call my parent element's parent element's little brother?
[23:22:56] <wowtux> VeXii, error is in feedUri , it cant read
[23:23:23] <wowtux> VeXii, coldhead no, with window.feedUri doesnt works yet
[23:23:54] <coldhead> oh no
[23:23:55] <coldhead> i am sorry
[23:23:59] <VeXii> where cant you read it=
[23:24:00] <VeXii> ?
[23:24:27] <wowtux> VeXii, coldhead if i put feedUri = value inside loadData function , all is working
[23:24:40] <VeXii> f.y.i you made it global in line 2
