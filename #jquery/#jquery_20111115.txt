[00:00:03] <jhgaylor> http://www.remotesynthesis.com/post.cfm/dynamically-add-placeholder-images-with-jquery
[00:00:03] <jhgaylor> ?
[00:01:47] <jhgaylor> Would someone mind looking at http://pastebin.com/zN2BwCVc and explaining my problem... making the assumption that var url contains a valid url
[00:03:27] <Cork> jhgaylor: the json or at least its variable name and structure is needed too
[00:04:04] <jhgaylor> https://dev.twitter.com/console using url https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/show.json?id=136343670071894016&include_entities=true
[00:04:04] <twolfson> isn't .each intended for arrays
[00:04:06] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from console: This needs a penis. #fb http://t.co/HKgvfnyM â˜… http://bit.ly/sc0XYr
[00:04:12] <twolfson> not objects
[00:04:14] <jhgaylor> that will give you the json result i am getting
[00:05:04] <Cork> jhgaylor: your running your code on twitter.com?
[00:05:18] <Cork> (assumes no)
[00:05:27] <jhgaylor> i am sending my request to twitter.com.  running localhost
[00:05:30] <Cork> jhgaylor: you need to use jsonp or proxy it over your own server
[00:05:43] <Cork> not sure if twitter supports jsonp
[00:05:48] <jhgaylor> hmmm
[00:05:50] <Cork> but json isn't posible cross domains
[00:06:01] <jhgaylor> let me paste u a segment that does work and see if that changes your respponse
[00:06:19] <jhgaylor> http://pastebin.com/Zyd8EaxU
[00:06:21] <Cork> jhgaylor: no, the browser will block calls to another domain
[00:06:25] <jhgaylor> because that request does work
[00:06:28] <Cork> you have no chance of succeeding
[00:06:46] <__n1v3K> is there such thing as free SSL cert? :?:
[00:06:48] <Cork> ah jsonp
[00:06:54] <Cork> __n1v3K: yes
[00:07:19] <ragas> $(document).ready(function(){ $('.content-head').css({'border-width':'9px', 'border-style':'solid', 'color':'red'});  });  this works fine when i plug it into the console, after the page loads, but embedded in the page it doesn't work.  ??
[00:07:31] <__n1v3K> Where can I get one? Hmm. I tried googling it, but their website looks kinda untrusted.
[00:08:14] <Cork> __n1v3K: http://www.startssl.com/?app=1
[00:08:19] <Cork> for example
[00:11:00] <Cork> jhgaylor: try something like http://pastebin.com/k3XEUzjT
[00:11:13] <Cork> jhgaylor: but you need to replace callback=? with a name
[00:11:31] <Cork> like callback=response
[00:11:32] <Cork> or something
[00:11:53] <Cork> bah json.resultsm, should be json.results,
[00:12:03] <twolfson> still won't solve his problem
[00:12:07] <jhgaylor> but that function worked before
[00:12:09] <twolfson> he is doing .each on an object
[00:12:11] <jhgaylor> why would i edit thaton?
[00:12:12] <jhgaylor> one*
[00:12:27] <twolfson> .each is intended for collections
[00:12:34] <jhgaylor>  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[00:12:36] <jhgaylor> read
[00:12:40] <twolfson> I already did
[00:12:42] <Cork> twolfson: results is an array
[00:13:03] <twolfson> k
[00:13:06] <Cork> so $.each(json.results, function() {}); will work just fine
[00:13:37] <jhgaylor> what was wrong with $(json.results).each(function(){}; ? it was doing what i expected it to in that function
[00:13:55] <Cork> that will try to convert the array into dom objects, and then loop over them
[00:14:00] <Cork> thats not what you want
[00:14:13] <Cork> you want to loop over the array and then you need $.each(array, function)
[00:15:18] <Cork> ex. $('<p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p>').each(function() { alert(this.innerHTML); });
[00:16:19] <jhgaylor> hmmm... well, making your change totally stops execution of the script.
[00:16:40] <jhgaylor> but you're right.  i don't want to make my results into dom objects.  i do just want to loop through the results
[00:17:21] <jhgaylor> HAHAHA.  its fixedish
[00:17:31] <Cork> jhgaylor: you need to give the json p a valid callback name
[00:17:42] <jhgaylor> you were right way earlier.  when you told me that i didn't need to do .each on this result set
[00:17:43] <Cork> that should fix most of your problems
[00:17:52] <jhgaylor> can it be anything?
[00:17:59] <Cork> yes
[00:18:02] <jhgaylor> it is just a var to describe me right?
[00:18:08] <Cork> no
[00:18:09] <jhgaylor> useragent
[00:18:11] <Cork> its a function name
[00:18:28] <Cork> its the name jquery will call to get the json from the javascript loaded from twitter
[00:18:47] <Cork> (jsonp is a normal javascript <script> tag that loads a function that returns the json)
[00:18:48] <anli_> Shouldnt document.location = document.location; reload the page?
[00:18:58] <Cork> its a workaround around the fact that json can't be loaded cross domain
[00:19:15] <Cork> anli_: why not just do document.location.reload() ?
[00:19:32] <Cork> oh wait its window.location.reload()
[00:19:34] <anli_> cork: still it puzzles me why the other way did not work
[00:19:46] <Cork> anli_: location is located on window, not document
[00:19:47] <anli_> That reloads the window, not the document
[00:20:06] <Cork> anli_: whats the difference=
[00:20:08] <Cork> *?
[00:20:13] <anli_> A window has many documents
[00:20:22] <Cork> frames?
[00:20:25] * Cork shivers
[00:20:52] <anli_> iframes are sometimes hard to avoid
[00:21:00] <Cork> no they arn't
[00:21:14] <anli_> If you want form based upload to work, they can be
[00:21:24] <Cork> $('#iframe_id')[0].location.reload()
[00:21:26] <Cork> should work then
[00:21:39] <anli_> Everything mentioned should work fine, now the question is why it does not
[00:21:44] <coldhead> iframes are the very devil and the living end
[00:21:50] <Cork> ya
[00:22:10] <anli_> I am sorry, but I dont do frame religion
[00:22:16] <coldhead> it's interesting to note that they're not even mentioned in the bible
[00:22:25] <coldhead> but they are expressly forbidden in the koran
[00:22:37] <anli_> :)
[00:22:49] <anli_> as you probably are
[00:22:56] <coldhead> it's not religion, is it, if you work with something every day for a few years and it constantly makes you reach for your revolver
[00:23:06] <coldhead> well actually that's a kind of religion
[00:23:11] <Greenman_> hello every... can someone help me with jqueryui resizables? it does not trigger the aspectRatio property to false after initialization. I found a #4186 which talks about this which is about 3 yrs old.
[00:23:20] <Greenman_> *everyone
[00:23:37] <anli_> Oh, he was here before
[00:23:42] <anli_> ;)
[00:23:51] <ragas> language="text/javascript" is wrong? coulda sworn ive used that before.
[00:24:09] <_serial_> shouldnt it be type ragas?
[00:24:12] <Greenman_> *bug tracking number #4186
[00:24:25] <JKarsrud> ragas: type="text/javascript"
[00:24:26] <Cork> ragas: thats way, way way WAY old and wrong
[00:24:45] <Cork> ragas: type has been the correct way for many years
[00:25:00] <Cork> (language never had text/ btw)
[00:25:57] <Greenman_> anyone? no one? guess I should file it a bug report then...
[00:26:55] <coldhead> Greenman_: can you find anywhere the magic words "closes #4186" ?
[00:27:04] <coldhead> or see that the status is closed?
[00:27:47] <coldhead> and if that's a bum steer check in with aj "mr jquery ui handjobs for all" piano when he's around
[00:28:48] <Greenman_> coldhead: nope... its still open, and for 3 years!!!
[00:29:01] <Greenman_> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4186
[00:29:04] <coldhead> right
[00:29:06] <coldhead> that stinks
[00:29:45] <coldhead> if you can wait until morning in the US east coast have ajpiano check it out
[00:29:49] <coldhead> he loves UI so much
[00:30:29] <coldhead> i see there are workarounds on that page, Greenman_
[00:30:33] <coldhead> they any good to you?
[00:30:44] <coldhead> it's cute how they keep moving it between Critical and Blocker
[00:30:46] <coldhead> and not fixing it
[00:30:51] <Greenman_> alright, I will wait and have a talk with ajpiano... if nothing works, I will try to open a new bug report.
[00:31:09] <coldhead> if it's the same bug, you won't want to do that
[00:31:16] <coldhead> they'll just mark it as a duplicate
[00:31:23] <coldhead> and be annoyed with you
[00:31:27] <Greenman_> I know. Nope none of the workarounds work with the new version. It looks like the new version is completely rewritten!
[00:31:36] <coldhead> and it's STILL broken
[00:31:38] <coldhead> blergh
[00:32:03] <coldhead> there's probably a good case there to try and adapt the workaround while aj dreams his dreamy little dreams
[00:32:11] <coldhead> but there's also a good case to go get loaded and burritos
[00:32:25] <coldhead> the question is which is to be master
[00:32:31] <coldhead> i'm rooting for burritos
[00:33:54] <Greenman_> lol... thanks for your response coldhead... at gonna hit bed...been scratching head for a while. Will try to get catch ajpiano tomorrow.
[00:34:14] <Greenman_> bye
[00:34:44] <coldhead> Greenman_: i will never forget you
[00:35:02] <coldhead> and our time together
[00:35:08] <jhgaylor> haha cold
[00:37:52] <jhgaylor> how do you guys choose to url encode strings in JS?
[00:38:46] <coldhead> json everything
[00:38:48] <uchuff> alert((Array(16).join("lol" - 2) + "batman"));
[00:39:02] <bedspax> hi guys
[00:39:07] <uchuff> sup
[00:39:07] <bedspax> I have a problem with .focus() on an element
[00:39:19] <bedspax> I'm using
[00:39:19] <bedspax> $("input.usr-login").focus();
[00:39:23] <bedspax> but don't work? why?
[00:39:42] <bedspax> Am i wrong?
[00:40:01] <Cork> $("input.usr-login")[0].focus();
[00:40:09] <bedspax> thx
[00:40:09] <Cork> .focus is a dom function not a jquery one
[00:40:27] <uchuff> there is a jquery focus i think
[00:40:38] <uchuff> but that will be binding an event handler to a focus event
[00:40:58] <Cork> uchuff: exactly there isn't a trigger
[00:40:58] <uchuff> which probably isn't what you are looking for based on the code you pasted, so yeah, what Cork said
[00:41:04] <Cork> like there is for ex. .click()
[00:41:28] <bedspax> uhm
[00:41:28] <bedspax> http://gyazo.com/2e62434ba23791b9e0d26ab90cef4ec5.png
[00:41:30] <coldhead> la la love you, Cork
[00:42:49] <Cork> bedspax: ya, the dom function doens't return anything
[00:43:06] <bedspax> Ok thanks! ;)
[00:45:59] <beasty_> morning
[00:46:12] <beasty_> anyone ever used $.blockUI()?
[00:47:05] <coldhead> ?anyone @ beasty_ // :P
[00:47:05] <bot-t> beasty_, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[00:47:13] <EugenA> hi, i'm trying to load jquery lib, but get error : unexpected end of XML source
[00:47:15] <EugenA> why?
[00:47:26] <nospinzy> anyone know a website with some cheap us proxies
[00:50:05] <coldhead> EugenA: pastebin the code you are using to include jQuery for us
[00:50:22] <coldhead> try replacing your local copy of jQuery
[00:50:29] <coldhead> try loading jQuery from google's CDN
[00:50:39] <coldhead> and so on
[00:51:22] <jhgaylor> any idea why $.getJSON(url,function(json){}; would work but $.getJSON(encodeURIComponent(url),function(json){}; wouldn't?
[00:52:04] <Cork> why would you need encodeURIcomponet?
[00:52:27] <jhgaylor> twitter just says to make sure that all queries are sent encoded
[00:52:31] <nospinzy>  hey can someone go to this page quick and tell me if they see a blank captcha image
[00:52:34] <nospinzy> http://www.i-blackfriday.info/macys-black-friday-ad-2011/
[00:52:41] <zfkevin> Hi i noticed the mousemove event , but is it also possible to check if mouse is not moving ?
[00:52:56] <jhgaylor> i see an add and a captcha box
[00:53:03] <Cork> jhgaylor: i think jquery does that by it self
[00:53:07] * Cork checks
[00:53:46] <zfkevin> like mouse enter target element when is is not moving for like 2 seconds overlay it with another image
[00:54:06] <nospinzy> jhgaylor so its an ad in the captcha?
[00:54:11] <nospinzy> thats how its supposed to be
[00:54:20] <nospinzy> it keeps coming up blacnk for me
[00:54:21] <EugenA> coldhead: http://pastebin.com/GciWfnQh
[00:54:45] <jhgaylor> nospinzy: it looks like what you probably want it to look like.  It asks to complete a captcha and shows me an image with some quoted text.  asks me to enter said text
[00:54:55] <Cork> jhgaylor: hmm, nope it doesn't, but check th generated url, might be as simple as its not a valid url
[00:54:58] <EugenA> coldhead: i get error on <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js">
[00:55:17] <nospinzy> jhgaylor ok
[00:55:36] <coldhead> zfkevin: you could reset a timer every time the mouse moves, and check to see how long it's been since it last moved
[00:55:40] <jhgaylor> nospinzy: you might wanna hide the ad better though.  pretty easy to see through the captcha.  also, dreadful load time on it
[00:55:43] <Pallet> Hi all
[00:55:58] <jhgaylor> well, loadtime wasn't as bad the next time.  mighta been my net
[00:56:10] <zfkevin> ah sounds good , i hoped there would be an event like  onmousemove :P
[00:56:17] <zfkevin> thnx coldhead
[00:56:21] <nospinzy> jhgaylor i want people to see thru it
[00:56:28] <Pallet> I'm lookling for a select box that can have images and also the ability to disable certain elements from selection, can anyone point me in the right direction please
[00:56:37] <jhgaylor> nospinzy: then it works as expected.
[00:56:54] <nospinzy> well my webhost is pretty bad so it might have been the reason lol
[00:57:53] <jhgaylor> weird... my line var url = "someURLstringCheckedForFormattingAlreadyAndIsLegal"; works
[00:57:56] <jhgaylor> but url = encodeURIComponent(url); breaks it
[00:58:27] <coldhead> EugenA: that jQuery is loading fine
[00:58:34] <coldhead> those other scripts are bogus
[00:58:51] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/qDq7V/
[00:58:58] <Cork> Pallet: http://view.jqueryui.com/selectmenu/demos/selectmenu/default.html
[00:59:08] <EugenA> if i deactivate jquery, i get same error on next script
[00:59:25] <Cork> bah. they changed the demo...
[00:59:29] <beasty_> lol
[00:59:52] <beasty_> this is a dirty hack
[01:00:03] <beasty_> to block a page from scrolling
[01:00:39] <beasty_> $('body').css('overflow','hidden');
[01:00:44] <beasty_> any workaround on this ?
[01:00:48] <beasty_> or a 'cleaner' way ?
[01:01:21] <jhgaylor> looks pretty elegant to me
[01:01:42] <Cork> there is it
[01:01:46] <Cork> Pallet: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/selectmenu/index.html
[01:01:50] <coldhead> EugenA: there isn't really a domain called example.com
[01:02:03] <coldhead> so you can't load scripts from there
[01:02:18] <coldhead> your browser is redirected to http://www.iana.org/domains/example/
[01:02:26] <coldhead> and tries to load that as JS
[01:02:30] <coldhead> and that sure isn't JS
[01:02:33] <coldhead> those guys hate JS
[01:03:17] <EugenA> oh... <script> tag is in wrong position
[01:03:30] <EugenA> i just replaced my domain with example.com
[01:03:32] <jhgaylor> cork: i think jquery might encode my urls.  I say this because I tested the query test? and it passed it as test%3F
[01:04:07] <EugenA> now i'm getting error: $(document).ready is not a function
[01:04:08] <Cork> jhgaylor: no i think xhr does it
[01:04:08] <coldhead> that is not helpful, EugenA :)
[01:04:18] <coldhead> you get that error if you haven't included jQuery
[01:04:22] <jhgaylor> ?xhr
[01:04:23] <Cork> jhgaylor: just checked the jquery code, and there is no code for encoding the url there
[01:04:24] <bot-t> jhgaylor, XHR | jQuery Plugins - Plugins - jQuery - This plugin requires jQuery +1.3. that includes 1.3 beta releases (already out) http://plugins.jquery.com/project/XHR
[01:04:53] <jhgaylor> that bot is pretty useful if not slightly intrusive
[01:04:54] <EugenA> jQuery JavaScript Library v1.4.3 is included in head
[01:07:17] <coldhead> EugenA: jQuery is included and you are seeing $(document).ready is not defined?
[01:07:31] <coldhead> how about jQuery(document).ready(...
[01:10:26] <Hierofant> OWS gone from Zuccotti.  NYPD used LRAD:  http://i.imgur.com/VI488.jpg
[01:11:24] <coldhead> thanks Hiero
[01:12:05] <Hierofant> sorry.  I don't mean to OT the chan, but it's idle.  And cmon, this I think concerns every developer.
[01:12:16] <Hierofant> whether or not it concerns jquery.
[01:13:48] <coldhead> if i were complaining, Hierofant, you would know it :)
[01:14:02] <coldhead> watch me bitch when someone asks about facebook in here
[01:14:04] <EugenA> coldhead: this works: jQuery(document).ready(alert('ha'));
[01:14:20] <coldhead> EugenA: so something is overwriting your $
[01:15:03] <coldhead> you can easily workaround that like this: jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { ... all the code in here can use $ as normanl ...});
[01:15:21] <coldhead> Hierofant: have you been occupying?
[01:15:50] <Hierofant> no, but visiting Wall St
[01:16:14] <Hierofant> 3rd beer
[01:16:19] <Hierofant> cant sleep
[01:16:22] <Hierofant> 4 am
[01:16:28] <coldhead> eesh
[01:17:41] <jhgaylor> wish i could sleep... 4am.... broken script.  beer would be a welcome change.
[01:18:31] <EugenA> coldhead: ok, it worked, but not i'm getting error from jquery.accordion-a-1.0.min.js
[01:18:42] <EugenA> this.sections.prop is not a function
[01:20:06] <jhgaylor> Setup: lets say I have $('.class').each(function(){ someFunction(this); }); ||| then the first line of my function is elem=$(elem); where elem is the name of the parameter.  Q: what does elem=$(elem) actually do?
[01:21:45] <coldhead> EugenA: that plugin might actually be terrible then :(
[01:22:10] <coldhead> i'm about to head home but if you can get a live demo up someone could help you out
[01:23:21] <jhgaylor> i want to thank everyone who has helped me thus far.  my script is now doing what i wanted it to do when i came in here.  much more left to do on it, but so far so good :D
[01:26:34] <EugenA> $(document).ready is not working, but jQuery(document).ready is working... how can i repair it?
[01:27:11] <jhgaylor> do you have (function($)
[01:27:12] <jhgaylor> {
[01:27:16] <jhgaylor> shit.. one sec
[01:27:25] <jhgaylor> do you have (function($){}; in ur code?
[01:27:49] <coldhead> i'm glad it's working out, jhgaylor, good work
[01:27:54] <coldhead> don't be a stranger
[01:28:20] <jhgaylor> it is actually (function($){)(jQuery);
[01:28:30] <jhgaylor> if that isn't there I'm pretty sure $ has no meaning
[01:29:10] <jhgaylor> i'll try not to coldhead.  I had to download an irc client though... so remembering to pull it up and idle to watch for questions i can answer is going to be a task indeed.
[01:29:10] <JKarsrud> jhgaylor: yes, it's most likely still jQuery
[01:29:13] <coldhead> jhgaylor: if something steals your dollar you can do jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {...}); and the code inside the fn will be able to use $ as normal
[01:29:36] <coldhead> because jQuery gives the $ the value of jQuery
[01:29:47] <jhgaylor> yeah. I'm trying to answer EugenA's ?.  I'm hoping that helps him
[01:29:50] <JKarsrud> but by using an IIFE like that, you make sure that $ actually is jQuery
[01:30:11] <coldhead> he needs to use the ready() trick because something stole his $
[01:30:24] <jhgaylor> i use $(document.read(function()
[01:30:41] <JKarsrud> well, an IIFE that takes jQuery as an argument should work to :)
[01:30:41] <jhgaylor> i hate that irc wont do what i want it to >.<  i dont want a new line. ... i want a new line within my textbox
[01:30:53] <jhgaylor> what is an IIFE?
[01:30:59] <JKarsrud> ?g iife
[01:30:59] <jhgaylor> unknown term
[01:31:01] <bot-t> JKarsrud, Ben Alman » Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) - http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[01:31:13] <jhgaylor> oh.  that's a term for that notation?
[01:31:24] <JKarsrud> basically this: (function(params) { //code }(args));
[01:31:27] <coldhead> it's an awful term for that notation
[01:31:34] <coldhead> the true term is "alman function"
[01:31:37] <JKarsrud> :D
[01:31:56] <jhgaylor> i woulda called it an inline function.
[01:32:12] <JKarsrud> it's not
[01:32:19] <JKarsrud> why is that an inline function?
[01:32:23] <jhgaylor> i didn't say i wouldnt be wrong :D
[01:32:32] <EugenA> so.. what can i do?
[01:32:33] <JKarsrud> I'm just curious :)
[01:32:59] <jhgaylor> I just seem to remember hearing someone call it that once.
[01:33:06] <jhgaylor> i probably misunderstood what they were talking about.
[01:33:13] <JKarsrud> EugenA: try replacing $(function() {}); or $(document).ready(function() {}); with jQuery(document).ready($) {});
[01:33:28] <coldhead> well you people seem to have everything under control
[01:33:34] <coldhead> you all be well, please
[01:33:40] <jhgaylor> take care coldhead
[01:33:40] <JKarsrud> coldhead: indeed, so I'm leaving :D
[01:33:55] <JKarsrud> or taking a break to do some real work/whatever
[01:34:17] <jhgaylor> pro bono doesnt pay the lights, eh?
[01:35:26] <JKarsrud> nope, not exactly
[01:35:39] <hothead> coldhead's sudden disappearance has violated the law of conservation of head temperature
[01:35:53] <jhgaylor> it didn't while you were crab
[01:36:12] <JKarsrud> and we're pushing stuff to stage later today, so there's enough to finish up before pushing :)
[01:36:46] <JKarsrud> EugenA: did it work?
[01:37:07] <crab> jkarsrud: he already said that it works, first thing
[01:37:53] <JKarsrud> crab: yeah, but not in the same way that I said, I added a $ as a parameter to the handler, so that $ can be used inside the handler
[01:37:53] <jhgaylor> i probably shouldnt have taken on this job... when I first did I thought we could do all the queries server side.  it wasn't until later I found out twitter limited api calls per client per hour.  so we had to do the calls client side.  picked up jquery 2 days ago.  I'm pulling my hair out.
[01:37:55] <EugenA> my code: http://pastebin.com/Z6zLcHz3 error: missing ; before statement   ... jQuery(document).ready($) {
[01:38:33] <crab> eugena: he really meant jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { ... })
[01:38:52] <JKarsrud> EugenA: meh, typo from my side indeed
[01:39:21] <crab> jhgaylor: what is this job?
[01:39:32] <JKarsrud> EugenA: http://pastebin.com/gtunwcKJ
[01:39:47] <jhgaylor> just getting data from twitter and sorting it.
[01:40:21] <JKarsrud> jhgaylor: couldn't you just cache it on the server and pull for new data every five minutes?
[01:41:01] <JKarsrud> would be faster on the client too, because the server is fetching cached data
[01:41:45] <jhgaylor> the job is to accept a search term from the user.  exclude retweets, and sort by the number of times each tweet was retweeted.  it requires n+1 queries where n is the number of tweets we choose to have twitter return, which is a bitch... there is no way to do it in 1 query.
[01:42:14] <EugenA> JKarsrud: now it is better, but now this error: http://picpaste.de/pics/js_error-Qh8HxKX7.1321350101.png
[01:42:42] <jhgaylor> Well, like, I could use the streaming api to record to a DB and use it to manage stuff.  then i could write this all server side.  but it would require alot of time recording to be of any use
[01:43:02] <jhgaylor> i've finally finished all the api calls and got my data.  now i get to start figuring out how to sort it.  algorithm wise, no problem.  we have a small result set, so I'll just bubble sort some arrays.  the fun part is figuring out the jquery to move the elements around on the page
[01:43:38] <JKarsrud> EugenA: hmm, might be an issue with a widget or whatever you are using?
[01:44:04] <JKarsrud> EugenA: can you make a jsfiddle?
[01:44:18] <jhgaylor> is jsfiddle the new pastebin?
[01:45:46] <JKarsrud> it's so much better, because you can make a deo

[01:50:12] <jhgaylor> because it's IE
[01:50:19] <minna> ...
[01:50:40] <jhgaylor> sorry.  i don't have anything useful to say, but I do like to anti-fanboyishly base microsoft
[01:50:48] <jhgaylor> bash*
[01:50:59] <minna> So do i buddy, so do i.
[01:51:09] <jhgaylor> ill look tho
[01:51:16] <minna> Thanks.
[01:51:25] <Aamir> minna:  what u actually trying to achieve
[01:51:48] <minna> Aamir: The fiddle should be very clear about taht.
[01:52:13] <Aamir> minna:  making links out of drop down ?
[01:52:16] <minna> Convert the select element to a div with links.
[01:52:19] <minna> Yeah.
[01:52:37] <minna> It works in chrome, ff ( even 2.0), ie9, safari but not IE7-8
[01:53:36] <minna> it complains about not getting a string, number or identifier, but it's there...
[01:53:53] <JKarsrud> EugenA, maybe.. I don't know which version that is made for, sooo
[01:54:10] <JKarsrud> but it's not really that hard to make an accordion yourself really :)
[01:54:34] <Aamir> minna: try http://jsfiddle.net/cb8xS/1/ :|
[01:54:42] <EugenA> it is working with 1.6.2 ( i have working example)
[01:55:20] <minna> Aamir: What about the rest? :-)
[01:55:37] <Aamir> minna: add ur classes and stuff later once its working in IE
[01:55:38] <EugenA> i'm trying to include this script in magento, but magento includes already jquery 1.4.3
[01:56:00] <minna> This is reducilous, fucking IE.
[01:56:10] <Aamir> minna: what still not working ?
[01:56:19] <minna> its working.
[01:56:23] <minna> i mean my original sample.
[01:56:41] <EugenA> i think it is not easy to deactivate magento's jquery on my page, could i somehow replace / reinclude my jquery?
[01:58:30] <minna> thanks Aamir, atleast its working
[01:58:43] <Aamir> minna: you want something onChange event?
[01:59:10] <minna> Aamir: No problem, i've got it from here :-)
[01:59:31] <Aamir> minna: cool :)
[02:00:19] <JakeyChan> hi ?
[02:00:33] <JakeyChan> how to set default value for select input type ??
[02:00:45] <jhgaylor> SELECTED
[02:01:02] <minna> jhgaylor: OK
[02:01:34] <jhgaylor> maybe its selected=true. i think its just selected
[02:01:43] <JakeyChan> yeah ? selected ?
[02:01:53] <JakeyChan> let me try
[02:03:05] <jhgaylor> <option value="x" selected="selected">x</option>
[02:03:16] <JakeyChan> thanks !
[02:03:33] <jhgaylor> jakeychan: just drop the selected attr on the non selected

[02:05:43] <Aamir> minna: just for fun http://jsfiddle.net/cb8xS/2/ :P
[02:06:46] <minna> Aamir: That's nice, but i need the attributes :-)
[02:06:58] <Aamir> minna: attributes of?
[02:08:31] <minna> select id, select onchange, option values
[02:10:08] <Marmotz> hi
[02:11:35] <Marmotz> how to manage a blur event on a group of element ? (i have a div with some input/select/label and i want to fire an event when user give focus to an other element)
[02:14:57] <jhgaylor> would it work to use a selector in such a way as to save the results to an array?like var a = $('class'); and then access the results via index?
[02:16:15] <minna> jhgaylor: Maybe, but sure sounds complicted
[02:16:20] <minna> complicated*
[02:16:34] <jhgaylor> im gonna write up a fiddle for it real quick
[02:16:43] <minna> Cool
[02:17:46] <Marmotz> could someone help me, please ?
[02:18:05] <Marmotz> how to manage a blur event on a group of element ? (i have a div with some input/select/label and i want to fire an event when user give focus to an other element)
[02:21:56] <jhgaylor> http://jsfiddle.net/ebWB8/1/
[02:22:03] <jhgaylor> think it's gonna work?
[02:22:14] <Marmotz> okay...
[02:23:14] <minna> jhgaylor: ?!?..
[02:23:24] <jhgaylor> wait... thats not right
[02:23:27] <jhgaylor> one sec
[02:24:32] <jhgaylor> http://jsfiddle.net/ebWB8/3/ that should be right though
[02:24:36] <minna> why not put the both selectors in a var, and use an if statement to compare the variables?
[02:25:06] <jhgaylor> both selectors?
[02:25:11] <minna> Oh. Nevermind :)
[02:25:25] <minna> And you'r loading mootools

[02:26:12] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys. I have an onclick events that .loads a page into a buffer div (<div id="buffer"></div>). That page has a script that replaces a class on some divs. But after 5-6 clicks, the script from the page doesn't work anymore? It's like the browser stops executing it?
[02:27:32] <jhgaylor> would someone mind helping me debug http://jsfiddle.net/ebWB8/6/
[02:29:00] <jhgaylor> im afraid some of what i did there isn't legal
[02:29:24] <beasty_> idd
[02:29:44] <gregoryLwD> $('body').on("submit", 'form', {test:'hi'}, false); does not stop forms loading
[02:29:53] <jaffipaffi> What could cause the problem I'm experiencing?
[02:30:29] <gregoryLwD> nor does $('body').on("submit", 'form', {test:'hi'}, submitForm); call	function submitForm(myData) {
[02:30:56] <beasty_> mm
[02:31:20] <beasty_> $('form').submit(function() { return false; });
[02:31:44] <Cork> $('form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }); if you may :)
[02:31:56] <BarryCarlyon_> Indeed was about to say http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/ for the win
[02:32:04] <Cork> lol
[02:32:05] <beasty_> that's also a posibility
[02:32:50] <Cork> but $('body').on("submit", 'form', {test:'hi'}, function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }); should also work
[02:33:04] <jhgaylor> can someone explain to me why http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/ isn't acting as expected, and maybe the correct way to go about it.
[02:34:26] <jhgaylor> the algorithm there is bubble sort.  i can change sorting algorithms.  it is just the one i know
[02:35:12] <gregoryLwD> Cork, ah I needed it to be within the function that says once the page has loaded
[02:35:24] <gregoryLwD> .submit is no good as forms are loaded automatically
[02:35:57] <gregoryLwD> now all I need is to pass the form object to the function instead of test:hi

[02:41:18] <Cork> gregoryLwD: ah, ya. its a bit hard to bind an element that doesn't exist yet XD
[02:41:26] <Cork> (body in this case)
[02:41:56] <hiall> Is it possible to get the children of a section of a page set within the extend defaults? http://paste2.org/p/1778497 <-- like that
[02:43:17] <Cork> yes, but you prob don't want children but .find
[02:43:38] <minna> .attr({}) is buggy as hell on IE7-8, i have like five tests that dont work at all
[02:43:47] <Cork> hiall: children only lists direct children, if they are sub children they won't be found
[02:44:12] <Cork> minna: you might want prop instead
[02:44:22] <minna> prop?
[02:44:26] <minna> The new stuff?
[02:44:26] <Cork> ?.prop
[02:44:26] <bot-t> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[02:44:43] <minna> Hm, but can it set attributes too?
[02:44:54] <Cork> yes
[02:44:58] <minna> Oh my
[02:45:06] <Cork> but it sets them on the property instead of as attributes
[02:45:17] <Cork> and thats prob what you want in 1.6+
[02:45:24] <minna> ...
[02:45:29] <hiall> Cork, I was trying to find direct children but I don't think jquery likes me doing options.container.children(); wondering how else I do this
[02:45:31] <minna> the .attr() method sometimes took property values into account when retrieving some attributes, which could cause inconsistent behavior
[02:45:34] <minna> You don't say
[02:45:47] <Cork> ya, attr was a mess before
[02:45:55] <Cork> its much cleaner now
[02:46:14] <minna> :-S
[02:46:17] <minna> good to know
[02:46:25] <minna> there should be a large warning on .attr
[02:46:34] <Cork> its in the release notes ;)
[02:46:43] <minna> Yeah, should be in the docs too
[02:48:55] <jhgaylor> can someone explain to me why http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/ isn't acting as expected, and maybe the correct way to go about it.
[02:53:36] <minna> jhgaylor: i have no idea. i tried changing around in the order, loading the plugin first etc. but then i got an infinite loop
[02:54:02] <DarsVaeda> hi, I want to select all links that are in a DIV with name "foo", how do I do that?
[02:54:22] <DarsVaeda> $('#foo a) -> right?
[02:55:29] <minna> Cork: Even .prop shoots the same problem in IE7-8. http://jsfiddle.net/cb8xS/4/
[02:59:13] <Cork> minna: not an answer to your problem, but... don't use inline event handlers... >_<
[02:59:33] <tys> somebody around that knows something about using on instead of live?
[02:59:51] <minna> Cork: Im still learning, what is inline event handler?
[03:00:09] <Cork> onchange, onclick, onmousemove
[03:00:23] <Cork> use .bind or the shorthand .change or .delegate, .live instead
[03:00:54] <Cork> minna: see ?.bind and see ?.change
[03:00:54] <bot-t> minna, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/

[03:01:13] <minna> Cork: Oh, i'm replacing the onchange event from the previous element that is from the CMS, i would never dream of using onchange on an element.

[03:03:12] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, suppose I am resizing a window by draging the corner, is there anything so I can detect when I stopped resizing?
[03:03:25] <minna> Cork: The odd part is that if i apply the attributes one-by-one, IE7-8 says nothing.
[03:03:29] <jhgaylor> what would be in a if i said var a = $('.t');
[03:03:36] <Paveloosha> I mean any event or any tricks?
[03:05:14] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, is it possible?
[03:07:08] <blobby> Hey guys! Anyone know how I can pass a function to a last selected object? - http://jsfiddle.net/WjeE3/5/ - really bugging me :P
[03:07:39] <Cork> pass a function to an object?
[03:08:08] <blobby> Cork Yeah, I've shown the code I'm working with in the fiddle
[03:08:36] <blobby> Sounds silly, I know :P
[03:08:46] <crab> it doesn't actually make any sense.
[03:09:02] <Cork> blobby: when you want to pass extra parameters to a function, you do it though an anonymus wrapper
[03:09:05] <blobby> Maybe I didn't explain right xD
[03:09:31] <crab> blobby: if you want to pass parameters to writePostToPage, do something like function () { writePostToPage(params,you,want) }
[03:09:36] <Cork> blobby: but the way your calling it, "this" should be the element your looking for
[03:10:30] <crab> oh, so it was backwards, "last selected object to a function". yeah, "this" should be what you want.
[03:10:39] <blobby> I'm grabbing the post from an XML file, if that makes any difference?
[03:10:48] <Cork> nope
[03:10:56] <blobby> Okay :)
[03:11:05] <Cork> each passes the selected element as this
[03:11:22] <Cork> and it should also be the second argument
[03:12:21] <blobby> Would you mind showing in a fiddle? Just to make sure I'm following you guys right
[03:12:34] <Cork> can't as the function isn't in there
[03:12:37] <blobby> I only want the last found 'post' :)
[03:13:00] <Cork> function writePostToPage(index, element)
[03:13:01] <blobby> Okay, umm
[03:13:32] <blobby> Ahh, so I'll have to write it differently?
[03:14:23] <blobby> I use that function to first get all the posts, now I'm calling it to run for just the last post - the update/new post
[03:15:13] <blobby> I'll have to read what you guys said again xD
[03:15:38] <Cork> blobby: writePostToPage($(update).find('post:last')); ?
[03:15:43] <Cork> shouldn't that work?
[03:16:00] <Cork> if thats what you want
[03:17:51] <blobby> Cork hmm I'm not sure. I'll give it a quick go
[03:18:35] <jhgaylor> will sortT($('#tContainer')); call the function sortT with parameter being a dom element?
[03:21:44] <blobby> Cork that doesn't work. Not with my current setup anyway. I think you're on to something there though ;)
[03:22:14] <Cork> blobby: ya, i'm shooting in the dark as i don't know what that function looks like
[03:23:23] <zkirill> How do I call scrollTo only if I have to (the view is not in the position?)
[03:24:14] <blobby> Cork ahh sorry okay, writePostToPage collects all the info from the XML file. First, I call it via the each() to write each post to the page from the XML
[03:25:00] <blobby> Cork Now I want to call it for just the last post found in the XML - the new post
[03:25:34] <blobby> Cork all it does is grab the text and that, and append the info to the page
[03:25:35] <Cork> blobby: you know code says more then a 1000 words ;)
[03:25:45] <blobby> Cork haha ;)
[03:26:39] <Cork> anyway i'm off lunch

[04:10:33] <g105b> johnline3: really? It doesn't work in Chrome
[04:10:52] <g105b> johnline3: that exact example... click the button and there's about 3 second wait until any animation happens...
[04:11:06] <johnline3> maybe your dialog is breaking the script
[04:11:46] <g105b> johnline3: well that's what I thought ... putting the fadeTo animation before the dialogue doesn't seem to help either
[04:11:52] <g105b> I guess I'll just have to live with it
[04:12:02] <g105b> just thought there would be a simple solution.
[04:12:06] <johnline3> do you really need the dialog?
[04:12:21] <johnline3> i mean, its quite horrible to have popup windows like that these days

[04:52:49] <Logitec> Hello, I am not sure how to use a selector in this case. I've got $(this) which is the <tr>, inside this there are a couple of <td>'s, inside my target is a <form>, inside the form is an <input>, from this input i need the attribute "value"
[04:52:56] <Logitec> Could somebody help me out getting this value?
[04:53:24] <gregoryLwD> ?find
[04:53:24] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[04:53:59] <gregoryLwD> Logitec, so I think you can do $(this).find('input').attr('value')
[04:54:37] <Logitec> What an awesome function, let me try it out
[04:57:29] <chrisx86> hi, what is the best way to somehow "attach" a javascript object to a html element?
[04:57:52] <chrisx86> I used the .data() function.. but I'm not sure if its the way to go
[04:58:00] <puppen>  .
[04:58:05] <Cork> its defenitly the best way
[04:58:34] <Logitec> gregoryLwD: That didn't seem to work, my returned value is empty.  I tried doing something with children but it didn't work either.
[04:58:48] <chrisx86> hm ok, but it somehow feels a bit dirty.. because you use strings.. elem.data('myobj',obj) ^^
[04:59:04] <chrisx86> elem.myobj = obj seems not to work
[04:59:13] <Cork> it does but its a bad idea
[04:59:25] <jkgeyti> Hi. I'm trying to fetch a html page (using YQL) and scraping it for images, see http://jsfiddle.net/NyzXJ/2/. I'm fetching the html into a variable, response, and doing a $(response).find() on it. Unfortunetaly, this runs any onload()-actions in $(response), resulting in errors. How can I search a string for html elements without eval'ing (?) it.
[04:59:35] <Cork> chrisx86: some browsers leaks what you assign directly to the dom
[05:00:14] <Cork> (that would be element[0].myobj = obj though)
[05:00:34] <Cork> if your elem is a jquery object that is
[05:00:43] <chrisx86> k and why is that bad?
[05:00:46] <chrisx86> to have it in the dom
[05:00:58] <gregoryLwD> Logitec, do you need to get to the item through $(this) or can you identify it anyway, e.g. $('input).attr('value')
[05:01:09] <Cork> chrisx86: [2011-11-15 13:59:34] <Cork> chrisx86: some browsers leaks what you assign directly to the dom
[05:01:25] <Logitec> gregoryLwD: Let me make an example online
[05:01:44] <gregoryLwD> I think I'm going to go mad and bald if I can't work out my issue
[05:01:45] <gregoryLwD> I'm surprised there is no example 1.7 code for replacing form submit events with your own function
[05:02:15] <Cork> gregoryLwD: bind doens't work for you?
[05:02:29] <Cork> gregoryLwD: bind, live, and so on isn't depricated
[05:03:45] <gregoryLwD> Cork, I thought live was deprecated so I was trying to use .on
[05:04:18] <Cork> gregoryLwD: nope, on was added, but the other should still be fine to use
[05:04:33] <Cork> though i don't see why it wouldn't work
[05:04:35] * Cork tests
[05:04:40] <gregoryLwD> Cork, but will they phase the others out?
[05:04:55] <Cork> not that i heard of
[05:05:04] <gregoryLwD> nad nowhere it explains why you would want to use one oer the other
[05:05:14] <Cork> speed
[05:05:19] <Cork> on is faster on big pages
[05:05:31] <gregoryLwD> Corey, the forms get added dynamically, so I need to add it for future events
[05:06:12] <gregoryLwD> *for future forms
[05:07:10] <gregoryLwD> Corey, but I don't think it's recognising my function at all at the moment
[05:07:36] <Cork> gregoryLwD: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/yns9t/
[05:08:43] <Cork> gregoryLwD: remember to run event.preventDefault() at the top of the function
[05:10:39] <gregoryLwD> Cork, apparently returning false at the end  of the function should work too
[05:11:02] <Cork> gregoryLwD: ya, it normally does, but in a hacky way
[05:11:15] <Cork> it stops the event loop, and thats not always what you want
[05:11:34] <Cork> preventDefault stops the default browser event, but the event loop completes
[05:11:54] <gregoryLwD> hmm, I could give that a try
[05:12:15] <gregoryLwD> the connection between here and my webserver seems to have gone a bit slow now, so time for a pub lunch

[05:21:55] <eXeC64> Does jQuery have a function for submitting a post request as the main window. So I use ajax to submit a form and then the results of that are used to go to a new page using a post request.
[05:23:22] <erichynds> eXeC64: why use ajax then? just use a normal post
[05:25:49] <Cork> eXeC64: no, ajax can't do that; you need to generate a normal form and submit that
[05:26:14] <Cork> only way if you don't want to change page through js from the ajax response
[05:26:22] <eXeC64> erichynds: The first submission creates a record and then returns the primary key and one of the fields for the record. The second would be to visit a new page with the primary key in the URI and the field in post.
[05:26:37] <erichynds> you could window.location the user
[05:26:56] <Logitec> Hello, I am not sure how to use a selector in this case. I've got $(this) which is the <tr>, inside this there are a couple of <td>'s, inside my target <td> is a <form>, inside the form is an <input>, from this input i need the attribute "value"
[05:26:58] <eXeC64> Since I would like to have the primary key in the URI but not the field, is there a recommended way to do that?
[05:27:02] <Logitec> Could somebody help me out getting this value?
[05:27:44] <Cork> eXeC64: something like $.post(url, data, function(response) { window.location = url + '/' response.id; });
[05:28:19] <Cork> Logitec: do you have a name on the input field=
[05:28:20] <Cork> *?
[05:29:19] <eXeC64> Cork: That still doesn't send the field, which is required, hmm.
[05:29:45] <Cork> eXeC64: the first post sends the fields if i understood you correctly
[05:30:23] <Cork> Logitec: *poke*
[05:30:51] <eXeC64> Cork: The first post sends A, it receives B and C. It then needs to send the user to a new page where B is in the uri but C is sent as post data.
[05:31:10] <Cork> ouch
[05:31:27] <Cork> then you need to dynamically generate a form and submit that :s
[05:31:37] <eXeC64> Cork: That's what I was thinking of
[05:31:46] <eXeC64> Build a hidden form then submit it using jQuery?
[05:32:58] <Cork> eXeC64: var form = $('<form action="" methiod="post"><input type="hidden name="something" value="' + val1 + '"></form>'); $('body').append(form); form.submit()
[05:33:44] <eXeC64> Cork: Thanks, that looks to be just what I need.
[05:35:21] <b0ot> Is there a way that I can parse xml via php that would make it so I would have access to the variables inside an init() function? I'm trying to make a configuration ui that reads/writes xml and I'm trying to figure out what would be the best way to read the xml into variables to setup the page.
[05:36:02] <JKarsrud> b0ot: why not write json? :)
[05:36:27] <JKarsrud> or is it an old system that only reads/writes xml?
[05:36:30] <b0ot> JKarsrud, the system i'm trying to interface with uses xml files
[05:36:36] <JKarsrud> ok
[05:36:36] <b0ot> JKarsrud, exactly
[05:37:29] <JKarsrud> I'd probably return json to the view anyway, but if you return xml too, you can use jquery's .find() function to find elements in the returned xml and set those values to variables
[05:41:32] <JKarsrud> b0ot: you could do an xml -> json parsing to the view, and then maybe a json -> xml parsing back, if you need to save stuff
[05:42:16] <b0ot> JKarsrud, that seems like alot of extra translation and parsing
[05:42:35] <JKarsrud> yes, but how do you save stuff, then?
[05:43:08] <b0ot> After the config is modified via the page I will need to write the xml
[05:43:28] <JKarsrud> yeah, so you'd need to post something back to the server
[05:44:13] <JKarsrud> what that is, doesn't really matter, but an object serializer on the server sounds the easiest imo
[05:46:02] <b0ot> the xml isn't too large
[05:46:23] <g105b> fragile code...
[05:47:20] <b0ot> it will have less than 50 elements, although each of those could have around 10 children
[05:48:14] <okdan> Anyone knows whats wrong with view.jquery.com/trunk/plugins/autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.js ?
[05:48:17] <JKarsrud> yeah, so a serializer might not be a bad idea?
[05:48:26] <okdan> I linked to this URL, but the whole server seems to be down
[05:48:39] <okdan> so everything under /trunk
[05:49:22] <okdan> quite servere, my guess :)
[05:49:34] <JKarsrud> okdan: why?
[05:50:01] <okdan> because probably many people are linking to these URL
[05:50:04] <okdan> Å›
[05:50:05] <JKarsrud> I doubt it
[05:51:04] <okdan> Do you know a mirror, by chance?
[05:51:48] <JKarsrud> for the autocomplete plugin, no
[05:51:48] <pts\3> do you guys see anything obviously wrong with $('#'+newid+'>span') = $('#'+id).val(); ? it says "invalid left hand side blah" when i alert the output of the left part, it just says "#task1>span"
[05:52:33] <PrgmrBill> what's wrong with this: $('aside["data-question-id"]='+qid)
[05:52:34] <pts\3> oh
[05:52:39] <pts\3> i probably need .text or something i am a retard
[05:53:16] <JKarsrud> pts\3: uhm, you can't assign a value to an element like that, so text() or html() is what you want
[05:53:31] <pts\3> yeah i forgot it ._. thanks
[05:56:47] <okdan> well, i doubt not anymore, 104000 results in google pointing to http://dev.jquery.com/view/trunk/plugins/autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.js
[05:57:00] <okdan> and the thing is completety gone, crap
[05:59:42] <jwm> how do you compare against HTMLDocument
[05:59:53] <jwm> like I am trying to see what scrolled with e.target
[06:00:23] <jwm> I get back HTMLDocument
[06:02:51] <JKarsrud> that would be the document itself
[06:04:36] <jwm> yeah but its just Document
[06:04:44] <jwm> when I console.log(e.target)
[06:06:48] <lmatteis> can i check if a variable is an object or an array?
[06:06:54] <lmatteis> like, [..] vs {..}
[06:07:12] <lmatteis> i know array are actually objects... but i need to know if the argument passed in is either [] or {}
[06:07:20] <jwm> array has length, object doesn't
[06:07:27] <lmatteis> oh
[06:07:28] <lmatteis> hrm ok
[06:07:43] <lmatteis> jwm: unless they do obj["length"] = true; :)
[06:08:08] <jwm> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/767486/how-do-you-check-if-a-variable-is-an-array-in-javascript
[06:08:11] <jwm> true
[06:08:13] <jwm> so use that
[06:08:14] <jwm> instanceof
[06:08:32] <jwm> got to love stackoverflow
[06:08:33] <jwm> hehe
[06:09:35] <jwm> jquery has an isArray function to lmatteis
[06:09:40] <jwm> too*
[06:10:03] <lmatteis> oh nice

[06:56:43] <Stianhtml> Hello! Maybe some of you good folks can help me out.
[06:56:43] <Stianhtml> I have created a variable ( var myForm = $("form.contact") );
[06:56:43] <Stianhtml> If I want to select that form, _and_ one of the inputs inside of it, how would i go about that? I'm talking about something like this: $(myForm + "input:first") Now I realize I'm probably way off, but I'm guessing you guys know what I want to do.
[06:57:48] <phlp> redfox__: var a = '1,2,3'.split(','); $.each(a, function(i,o) { $('#edit option[value="' + o + '"]').remove(); });
[06:58:44] <Stianhtml> phlp? little help?
[06:58:59] <redfox__> Thanx phlp,
[06:59:15] <gregoryLwD> phlp, thanks that works well
[06:59:37] <phlp> Stianhtml: myForm.add('input:first')
[06:59:53] <Stianhtml> thank you very much sir!
[07:00:00] <gregoryLwD> using jsfiddle helps too, it's easier than cutting my code down to the core of the problem (and having to save all the other bits elsewhere)
[07:00:03] <kba> Could anybody please take a quick peek at this https://github.com/jbritten/jquery-tablesorter-filter/blob/master/tablesorter_filter.js
[07:00:17] <eternity13> phlp: thanks, find() works good!
[07:00:19] <kba> And tell me how I would call tbe function doFilter() that is defied withing tablesorterFilter: new function() { .. }
[07:00:26] <kba> within*
[07:02:14] <sente> kba: http://www.justinbritten.com/work/2008/08/tablesorter-filter-results-based-on-search-string/
[07:02:31] <sente> kba: that might point you in the right direction
[07:02:44] <kba> sente: No, it says nothing about what I want to accomplis
[07:02:46] <kba> accomplish
[07:03:12] <phlp> kba: $(table).trigger('doFilter');
[07:04:25] <sente> kba: sorry
[07:05:10] <kba> phlp: that doesn't seem to work. The function doFilter() takes an argument table, how would I pass that?
[07:05:22] <kba> sente: thanks though
[07:05:48] <kba> phlp: nvm, found it in the trigger docu
[07:05:58] <gregoryLwD> phlp, is it too much to ask to also get the attributes of the form? I thought that would be obvious to me once I get the form object http://jsfiddle.net/yns9t/20/
[07:06:46] <kba> It still doesn't seem to work though
[07:06:46] <redfox__> now i've gor another problem, i have 2 select box, when you select an option from the upper, this is added on the lower (with a button). is a multiple selct box so I've got all choises. but if i selct an item, when i send form i receive only the selected one. How I could solve this?
[07:07:13] <phlp> gregoryLwD: the target is the form but it's the dom element so to use jquery you need to do $(test.target).attr
[07:08:12] <gregoryLwD> phlp, right, and that gets me to the stage that things are obvious again. I knew I had to add some brackets and a $ in somewhere :)
[07:08:21] <Stianhtml> Hey phpl, sorry to bother you, what I'm trying to achieve is this: I have two forms on the same page, and i want to be able to reference each form via a variable, ie myForm1 and myForm2. The problem is that both forms have input fields with identical class names. Doing .add seems to search through the whole document for and attaches all matches (im very new as this as you clearly understand, so please bear with me), anyway, you follow wh
[07:08:21] <Stianhtml> to do?
[07:08:40] <gregoryLwD> he he, you just give some $$$ and you get what you want. << new motto for jquery?
[07:08:45] <clir-in> hi. is it posible to change the options in <select> without reloading the whole <select>.??
[07:09:00] <Stianhtml> I only want to select the input.className within the form which the variable is referencing
[07:09:30] <phlp> Stianhtml: myForm.add(myForm.find('input.className'))
[07:09:50] <Stianhtml> Thanks a bunch man
[07:10:42] <Chetic> how can I detect whenever a form element is added to the page?
[07:11:45] <m4xx_> anyone care to show me how to create a widget based on another correctly? this is my attempt: http://jsfiddle.net/AYMVA/3/
[07:12:18] <Avorin> hi @all, i have a problem with qunit, and since there is no official irc for qunit hope that maybe somebody can answer it here.
[07:14:27] <Avorin> i have a global object in a little lib i wrote, 2 keys in that object get altered, each time i call one of two specific functions of that lib, the only way to check if these functions-calls where successfull is to check the state of the keys, but the test of qunit do not run in the order i provide them
[07:14:44] <Avorin> therefore on of the 2 test for the functions fail
[07:14:47] <Avorin> one*
[07:16:20] <phlp> m4xx_: http://jsfiddle.net/AYMVA/8
[07:19:01] <lz> is there a benefit to creating a widget like that?
[07:20:12] <m4xx_> phlp: awesome. last question. in this version. is the call to the core._init needed? or does it get called anyway? http://jsfiddle.net/AYMVA/9/
[07:27:40] <phlp> m4xx_: looks like that is the way to do it. atleast when this was written http://blog.citrusbyte.com/2010/09/16/jquery-widgets-bringing-sanity
[07:32:23] <m4xx_> phlp: sorry, my connection died ;[ did you reply to me?
[07:32:35] <phlp> m4xx_: looks like that is the way to do it. atleast when this was written http://blog.citrusbyte.com/2010/09/16/jquery-widgets-bringing-sanity
[07:32:36] <m4xx_> stupid web client closed the channel =\
[07:37:30] <m4xx_> phlp: awesome, again, thank you =]
[07:37:40] <phlp> np :)
[07:38:38] <jsmreese> Saw a note yesterday on the jQuery blog about the jQuery summit happening now. Didn't get a chance to register yesterday, but went to set up a meeting room pass for my team this morning and I can't buy a ticket. Why? Because it started half an hour ago? That seems silly.
[07:47:19] <rns> is there a way to set the input type='number' for specific text inputs only when the browser is safari?
[07:52:39] <gregoryLwD> am I going mad? Why would this line cause an unexpected identifier? var window.testit = 'nothing';
[07:53:40] <cook1es> Guys what do you feel about this statement? "you condone using 3rd pty scripts on your site? what if the sites goes down? your site will be laggy forever, horrible practices " (refering to letting google host your jquery)
[07:54:24] <jwm> cook1es: I kind of agree, I prefer local hosting to using cdns
[07:54:29] <jwm> but that is just imo
[07:55:00] <phlp> gregoryLwD: because you dont use var for properties
[07:55:08] <ryanneufeld> cook1es: if google goes down, we have bigger problems than third party hosting
[07:55:39] <ryanneufeld> cook1es: if google goes down, then you update your HTML, and problem sloved
[07:55:42] <ryanneufeld> *solved even
[07:56:45] <gregoryLwD> phlp, ah you mean window.something is a property, where as var something is a variable? I'm using window. to make it global
[07:57:17] <cook1es> ryanneufeld: I'm not the one behind the statement, I couldn't live with myself then as he
[07:57:38] <cook1es> seems to be the biggest troll, I just need something to get him to understand how wrong he is
[07:57:52] <ryanneufeld> cook1es: don't feed the trolls
[07:57:59] <gregoryLwD> it's becoking a long day :(
[07:58:15] <ryanneufeld> I find it's best to just say "Okay, you have fun with that" and move on with your day
[07:58:43] <ryanneufeld> in this case, it's a matter of opinion
[07:58:44] <jwm> gregoryLwD: var is for local variables, window is for global
[07:59:10] <jwm> there was a good article against using cdns
[07:59:13] <pts\3> does using $.ajax({ only pass along the data you specify with data: ? i want it to send all inputs from my form, same behavior as clicking the "submit" button
[07:59:15] <ryanneufeld> for us, we have so much traffic that using google hosted jquery makes sense for us
[07:59:17] <jwm> gave quite a few points on it
[07:59:34] <xckpd7> I have an implementation question... I have a big site I'm working on that has 50 out of 100 pages (estimate) that have a submit button on the page that I need to convert to prettier submit buttons. Currently I'm converting that submit button individually on the 50 pages, and not just once: is it a good idea to have it do it once even though there are pages that don't use it? or is there a more modular way to do it?
[08:00:05] <jwm> one of them was firewalls/dns blocking
[08:00:31] <Pathogen-X> pts\3:  You can serialize the data.
[08:00:31] <xckpd7> I'm working within a framework and I don't feel I'm doing this efficiently enough... also if there are any jQuery patterns that could help me I would be very grateful to know them
[08:00:48] <pts\3> Pathogen-X: which means passing it through data: ?
[08:01:20] <pts\3> loop through every input and add the .val() to the .ajax call?
[08:01:21] <Pathogen-X> Yeh... Like:
[08:01:21] <Pathogen-X> data: $('#form').serialize(),
[08:01:25] <pts\3> oh
[08:01:29] <pts\3> much easier
[08:01:51] <pts\3> jquery is pretty slick
[08:03:13] <pts\3> thanks Pathogen-X
[08:19:27] <gregoryLwD> yes, everything works nicely!
[08:20:50] <gregoryLwD> I can get rid of all the debugging alerts(), go home, eat pizza, go to geeky php talk, go to pub, go to bed, take the rest of the week off (minus travel to & a day long meeting), supper!
[08:20:56] <gregoryLwD> and it's not quite 4:30pm
[08:22:04] <Prot> cant figure out how to select where either [attribute1] or [attribute2] exist for the same nodetype, without multiple function calls
[08:22:48] <Rushing> anyone recommend a particular brand for PC laptop?
[08:22:55] <Puj> hp
[08:22:56] <Prot> yeah, custom
[08:23:12] <Prot> if you buy hp brand, they'll give you an hp touchpad for $150
[08:23:28] <Rushing> hm that's cool
[08:24:50] <Puj> They are pretty good, not too much preinstalled bs
[08:25:14] <Rushing> i've had dell and vaio - how do they compare?
[08:25:19] <Puj> Haven't had a hardware problem for quite a while with hps
[08:25:36] <Puj> Dell tech support sucks hard
[08:25:55] <Puj> I don't like the asthetics of the vaios..
[08:26:57] <evan7900> evan7900 How can I make a link on click drop the page down. Then when I click on a new link that page goes up then the new page comes down
[08:26:59] <Rushing> ok, any experience with macbooks? i'm considering making the switch...but i've just always been on PC
[08:27:26] <Rushing> evan7900, that could be really simple or pretty complex
[08:27:43] <evan7900> Really simple would be nice
[08:28:17] <evan7900> But if anyone knows how and could give me some pointers or a link that'd be nice
[08:28:18] <Rushing> if you have all the content on a single static page, you could just make your links anchor links, then $("a").live("click", function(){ $(this.hash).slideDown()  });
[08:28:27] <VictorCL> how can I get the :selected of a select from its name?
[08:28:32] <Puj> Macbooks are great.  But, I personally work faster on a pc
[08:28:45] <Puj> Macbook Pro*
[08:29:28] <evan7900> Thanks for the info rushing
[08:29:34] <evan7900> I'll try it out
[08:29:48] <Rushing> VictorCL, $("[name='whatever'] option:selected")
[08:30:06] <Rushing> np evan7900
[08:30:20] <VictorCL> $("select[name='permiso_id']).val()   is the same thing ?
[08:31:59] <Rushing> VictorCL, no, it's not
[08:32:02] <Godfather_> hi
[08:32:13] <Rushing> val gets the value of the selected option, :selected gets the actual option element
[08:32:51] <VictorCL> ok I need the the option value
[08:32:53] <Godfather_> im searching for a scrolling like this, http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#side-scroll  but it seems this scroll its just horizontal
[08:33:08] <Rushing> then yeah, val() is what you need
[08:33:27] <VictorCL> ok great
[08:39:12] <Skrubis> Hey, anyone here?
[08:39:19] <rabbitMQ>  boo!
[08:39:26] <gregoryLwD> ahhh!
[08:39:33] <gregoryLwD> I'm just leaving actually...
[08:39:40] <devaholic> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3238673
[08:40:14] <Skrubis> I just learning JS, so jquery is kind of new world for me, could anyone of you help me out with some code?
[08:40:54] <gregoryLwD> Skrubis, welcome to the wonderful world of js being easier
[08:42:28] <silverwind> What? :/
[08:42:36] <silverwind> jQuery is about the DOM, not JS.
[08:42:48] * silverwind is sad.
[08:43:34] <Skrubis> So, the problem: I have this code: http://pastebin.com/TJfBz7Dh that on hover shows the nav menu, I want to make a new function, so that I can show the menu with a click on "a" with ID, and hide with another link.
[08:43:58] <Skrubis> Any of you help me solve this, I commit to buy you a beer via paypal :)
[08:44:15] <silverwind> I want lulz and love... not beer :(
[08:44:59] <Skrubis> Ok, coffee, if you so choose. It will help you to not miss any lulz
[08:45:21] <Stereo> money can't buy love, but can money buy lulz?
[08:46:31] <Skrubis> no money can buy you a chance to not miss any love, like amphetamines
[08:46:42] <Skrubis> or lulz
[08:47:11] <Skrubis> whatever, anyone willing to help me with my problem thus helping me learn jquery
[08:47:38] <Skrubis> and earning a beer or a coffee
[08:49:19] <silverwind> Why does it have to be that complex? (Your code)
[08:49:50] <silverwind> (Complex for what you need to do)
[08:50:10] <silverwind> Skrubis, could you write something on jsfiddle?
[08:52:29] <zoned> in a production environment, would it be bad practice to link to the latest jquery.js file link (so that the file is hosted on the jquery servers not locally) ?
[08:52:49] <Skrubis> I want the code to work with current site, so I just want to add a handle that turns the hover on or off, located in "a" element defined by id.
[08:55:19] <silverwind> zoned, As long as you specify a specific version.. it's fine.
[08:55:55] <djQuery> anyone familar with jqgrid know how to change a colname after the grid has been initialized?
[09:03:57] <room> It'd be great if you could do: someObject.last( function )
[09:04:04] <Eviltwin> ?
[09:04:35] <Eviltwin> jqObj.filter(function).last()
[09:04:54] <paul_uk> Hi, I've got a drop down that you can scroll through the options with mouseover.  But anyone know a way of smoothing out the scroll?  http://jsfiddle.net/epcJB/
[09:04:57] <room> like the .get()   you can throw a function between the parenthesis
[09:05:11] <room> But you can't for the .last =[
[09:05:17] <room> * .lat()
[09:05:24] <room> ** .last()
[09:05:25] <room> lol
[09:05:53] <Eviltwin> paul_uk: Use .animate
[09:06:09] <Eviltwin> It really looks fine to me
[09:07:54] <aaronj1335> hey folks! i'm having trouble returning a value from a custom jquery ui widget.  i've posted a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronj1335/cT4zV/1/
[09:07:57] <room> Eviltwin oh wait! Are you saying I can select the objects, pass a function, but only have the function operate on the last object by doing that: jqObj.filter(function).last() ?
[09:08:27] <Eviltwin> room: That query will give you the *last* element that matches that filter function
[09:08:32] <worlds> d
[09:08:37] <worlds> a world apart from me
[09:08:57] <m4xx_> if i call a widget's method $('selector').widget('method'), how do i reference the widget's options from with in that method?
[09:09:28] <aaronj1335> i'd like to be able to call $('div#mine').objectpicker('getMl') on my custom jquery ui widget, and return an array, but instead i get a jquery object
[09:09:46] <room> Eviltwin ah, so the function is part of the filter? Thought it was too good to be true :P
[09:09:46] <Rembane> m4xx_: With another dot.
[09:09:49] <pts\3> after pressing enter in a text input, the form is submitted with jquery's ajax thingy. i want to blur the <input> that was focused when enter was pressed.  i tried $('input[type=text]').live('focus', function() { $(this).blur(); in the submit call.  this makes it impossible to select any input ever again :/
[09:10:13] <Rembane> m4xx_: $('selector').widget('method').option1
[09:10:19] <Eviltwin> room: Yeah, .filter() lets you filter by a function
[09:10:31] <Eviltwin> Gives you only the elements from the collection that match the filter
[09:10:37] <Eviltwin> Then you can further reduce that set
[09:12:09] <room> Eviltwin Do you know of any way to select the last object then throw that into an already defined function? It's been wrecking my brain for days
[09:12:37] <m4xx_> Rembane: i'm trying to access the options from with in the widget's
[09:12:37] <room> Eviltwin I know how to select the last object. It's just getting it to the function
[09:12:52] <pts\3> man my connection sucks.
[09:13:34] <pts\3> did anyone comment on how to blur a focused element?
[09:13:35] <Eviltwin> room: An already defined function?
[09:13:39] <Rembane> m4xx_: What kind of widget?
[09:13:50] <Eviltwin> room: Can you make a jsFiddle example of what you're trying to do?
[09:14:03] <m4xx_> making one with widget factory
[09:14:05] <room> Eviltwin yeah sure :)
[09:14:30] <Rembane> m4xx_: What widget factory?
[09:14:55] <m4xx_> j-ui 1.8.16
[09:15:00] <aaronj1335> Eviltwin: would you be able to help me w/ my jquery ui widget question? (http://jsfiddle.net/aaronj1335/cT4zV/1/)
[09:15:25] <Eviltwin> aaronj1335: I took a look and I don't remember enough about how $.widget works
[09:15:27] <m4xx_> Rembane: -^
[09:15:36] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[09:15:54] <aaronj1335> Eviltwin: no worries, thanks for taking a look!
[09:16:02] <Rembane> m4xx_: Could you paste some code that might give me some direction of what you are trying to do
[09:17:10] <ajpiano> aaronj1335: you have to use the 1.8 widget factory or later
[09:17:17] <ajpiano> to get that automatic return behaviour http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/cT4zV/2/
[09:17:29] <room> Eviltwin http://jsfiddle.net/ugrz8/ - hope I've explained well enough there
[09:17:48] <m4xx_> Rembane: i must be half asleep, i got it ;] thank you
[09:17:55] <pts\3> who else just got a pm from worlds ?
[09:18:22] <Eviltwin> room: $(update).find('post:last').last().each(writePostToPage); ?
[09:18:30] <aaronj1335> <ajpiano>: thanks i'll take a look
[09:18:36] <Eviltwin> Oh, wait
[09:18:39] <Eviltwin> This is slightly different
[09:18:52] <room> Eviltwin I think I may have tried that combo ....I'll give it another shot :)
[09:19:20] <worlds> Eee
[09:19:23] <worlds> Sweedish
[09:19:31] <worlds> What's meganet.lt
[09:19:35] <worlds> Rarg darg nargs
[09:19:36] <Rembane> m4xx_: No worries. :)
[09:19:50] <worlds> What is jquery is it like the next Java
[09:19:51] <Eviltwin> $('a').each(writePostToPage) is equivalent to var tags = document.getElementsByTagName('a'); for(var i = 0; i < tags.length; i++) { writePostToPage(tags[i]); }
[09:19:53] <worlds> Or what is AJAX
[09:20:03] <worlds> The last I did for Java was Java 2.0 in 2002
[09:20:14] <ajpiano> worlds: please do not troll the channel
[09:20:20] <ajpiano> or PM its members indiscriminately
[09:20:31] <pts\3> thanks guys peace out
[09:20:41] <worlds> alright I'll leave then
[09:20:45] <ajpiano> excellent
[09:23:36] <room> Eviltwin In my setup, I think the .each() is messing things up. The first new post is added fine. When another one is added to the XML is just duplicates the first new one added ...if you follow me :P
[09:24:36] <Eviltwin> Does writePostToPage look use "this"?
[09:24:41] <Eviltwin> Or something like that
[09:25:41] <Eviltwin> Since you're only hitting one element, you could try writePostToPage($(update).find('post:last').get(-1))
[09:25:42] <room> Eviltwin yeah, it uses $(this)
[09:27:04] <room> Eviltwin I'll need to give the function a param that way? function writePostToPage (arg) { ..... }
[09:27:14] <Eviltwin> Were you planning not to?
[09:28:03] <room> Eviltwin Nope :P I don't think doing so will mess up anything else so I'll give that a quick go :)
[09:28:52] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/5UmTN/
[09:32:13] <room> Eviltwin ooh I'll have to knock off the $(this) in the function wont I. If I use function __ (post) { ... } I should use 'post' instead of $(this)  ...I'm guessing?
[09:32:28] <room> Eviltwin My head's fuzzled lol
[09:33:34] <Eviltwin> When in doubt, try to avoid the late binding of this
[09:33:48] <Eviltwin> For the strict binding of normal vars
[09:36:55] <room> Eviltwin okay, I think I'm starting to follow you xD
[09:39:51] <djQuery> grrrr why is jqgrid throwing an overlay on my whole page? http://jsbin.com/oquxuk/35/edit
[09:41:18] <room> Eviltwin I think I'm still missing something. Maybe I need to go back to 'How to write a function' lol
[09:41:53] <room> Eviltwin I've never used parameters / arguments before
[09:43:36] <Eviltwin> room: Wait, really?
[09:43:46] <Eviltwin> Then definitely you need to go back
[09:44:22] <room> Eviltwin yep. Until now, I've only been doing very, very basic stuff.
[09:44:30] <Eviltwin> You need to learn JavaScript
[09:45:30] <room> Eviltwin Yeah. I've learnt some JavaScript, but I definitely need to revise some more. Parameters is basic stuff really aint it xD
[09:45:38] <nail_> djQuery: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1533243/jqgrid-search-form-behind-the-transparent-modal-overlay-window
[09:46:03] <nail_> djQuery: I added <link href="http://trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/themes/ui.jqgrid.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> and it fixed it
[09:46:41] <bot-t> room, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[09:46:53] <djQuery> nail_: thanks man that read it
[09:47:17] <nail_> no worries :)
[09:47:18] <djQuery> *that  FIXED it
[09:47:29] <djQuery> now why isnt it binding to myData now?
[09:47:45] <Eviltwin> room: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/
[09:47:56] <Eviltwin> room: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide
[09:48:28] <room> bot-t Eviltwin Thanks guys! :)
[09:49:04] <Eviltwin> Start with bot-t's suggestion or my second one
[09:49:12] <room> bot-t Eviltwin I've been doing some courses from Lynda.com as well. I'll give those a read though :)
[09:49:53] <room> Eviltwin ahh yes, Mozilla! Keep forgetting about that! >.<
[09:51:08] <Eviltwin> So you definitely need to read the Functions section
[09:51:17] <Eviltwin> But should probably just work from the beginning
[09:52:08] <room> Eviltwin I'm not that much of a beginner xP but I will be starting from scratch regarding parameters
[09:52:37] <Eviltwin> Not understanding function arguments implies you're a beginner
[09:52:42] <Eviltwin> At least by our standards
[09:54:14] <Zackko> i have a ajax-driven tree that has a couple events on it, the getChildren event when you click the expand handle (which returns false) and the item click event that highlights an item. I also attach an event to the container so you can deselect items but for some reason when you click the expand handle, it trickles down to the container and deselects even though it returns false. http://jsbin.com/utehid/2/edit
[09:55:14] <room> Eviltwin yeah I guess :P Well, I got some reading and research to do! lol Thanks for your help! :)
[09:55:22] <Eviltwin> Zackko: I'm not seeing anything there. Can you please use jsFiddle instead?
[09:55:28] <Eviltwin> room: No problem. Good luck
[09:55:38] <room> bot-t Thanks for your suggestions too! :)
[09:58:12] <Zackko> http://jsfiddle.net/CUL6p/
[09:58:44] <Zackko> its not functional, way too much to make it so, but its close
[10:02:14] <gonssal> is it possible that zend form is limited to processing up to 30 $_POST items?
[10:02:24] <gonssal> with isValid for instance?
[10:02:41] <Eviltwin> Zackko: Why are you binding a new click listener inside a live?
[10:02:46] <Eviltwin> That's a really bad idea
[10:02:52] <gonssal> sorry bad channel
[10:07:15] <djQuery> can anyone tell me why jqgrid is not showing my data? http://jsbin.com/oquxuk/37/edit
[10:07:28] <Eviltwin> For some reason no jsbins are showing up for me
[10:07:38] <Eviltwin> So unless you dump it in jsFiddle or something else, I can't, sorry
[10:09:28] <djQuery> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/zhffr/
[10:09:39] <Zackko> Eviltwin: I just attach it only when items are selected, then detach it when theyre not. there's really not point lol I can just attach it once, but that's not really the issue, that's why I unbind it every time
[10:10:59] <Stereo> hello
[10:11:05] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ djQuery
[10:11:06] <bot-t> djQuery, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[10:11:58] <Stereo> is there an event I can get when an <input type=text> is changed? .changed only seems to activate when I focus out of that input
[10:12:20] <Stereo> I'd like to show the "Send" button as soon as the text in that field is changed
[10:12:20] <Eviltwin> Stereo: Probably need to resort to keyup
[10:12:33] <djQuery> Eviltwin: I did build a demo. from my Q you could just search for jqgrid
[10:12:36] <Stereo> I'll try that. Thanks!
[10:12:48] <Eviltwin> djQuery: Look at how much code you pasted
[10:12:58] <Stereo> and keyup should work with copy-pasting, deleting, etc.
[10:13:02] <Stereo> I think it'll be perfect
[10:13:18] <Stereo> drag and dropping won't work, but who drags and drops stuff in input fields?
[10:13:27] <Stereo> oh, autocomplete won't work, but that doesn't apply in my case
[10:13:42] <Stereo> too bad .change() is only triggered at the end
[10:14:00] <aleray> hi, how can I achieve this? http://dpaste.com/656952/
[10:14:08] <Eviltwin> Stereo: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/change.html
[10:14:31] <Eviltwin> aleray: All <p> tags in all <section>s?
[10:14:33] <Eviltwin> Or what?
[10:14:43] <aleray> I'd like to wrap the content of an element except for headings
[10:14:47] <djQuery> Stereo: right lcick paste into the field wont get it with just keyup.   $('form').on('keyup change', 'input:[type:text]', function(){});
[10:15:06] <djQuery> on does accept space seperated list of events doesnt it?
[10:15:08] <Eviltwin> aleray: Can there be headers littered in there?
[10:15:14] <aleray> Eviltwin, all the content of a <section> except headers
[10:15:15] <Eviltwin> djQuery: Pretty sure, yeah
[10:15:23] <Stereo> djQuery: good point
[10:15:32] <Zackko> Eviltwin: I just attach it only when items are selected, then detach it when theyre not. there's really not point lol I can just attach it once, but that's not really the issue, that's why I unbind it every time
[10:15:39] <Stereo> Eviltwin: what does "the text input is blurred" mean?
[10:15:51] <Eviltwin> Stereo: Opposite of focus
[10:15:55] <Stereo> oh
[10:15:56] <Eviltwin> User clicks away from that field
[10:15:57] <Stereo> of course
[10:15:59] <Stereo> ok
[10:16:23] <Stereo> thank you both :)
[10:16:36] <aleray> Eviltwin, all the content of a <section> except headers
[10:16:40] <aleray> oups
[10:16:40] <Eviltwin> aleray: My question was if the header was always the first thing in the section or not
[10:16:45] <aleray> yes
[10:16:48] <aleray> Eviltwin,
[10:17:14] <Eviltwin> And there aren't any others in the <section>?
[10:17:19] <djQuery> Zackko: why not just use on or delegate then the event can be made to where it will on be bound when it is selected.   $('body').on('focus', 'li.selected', function(){});
[10:17:41] <aleray> Eviltwin, no
[10:17:44] <djQuery> Zackko: if you remvoe the selected class from the li it wont fire the event
[10:19:34] <Eviltwin> aleray: I would try something like this: http://pastebin.com/QzYUWLwP
[10:20:36] <xckpd7> is there a video for these slides or any similar video based on this? http://www.slideshare.net/garann/sneaking-structure-into-your-dombased-application
[10:20:39] <Zackko> djQuery: thats a good approach, but it doesnt solve my issue. Sorry for not being clear: if there are items selected and you click the expand handle, i dont want it to fire, so items are in fact selected when you click the expand handle at times
[10:21:13] <djQuery> Zackko: also I am coming into the convo late
[10:21:34] <aleray> Eviltwin, thanks, it seems to make the deal ;)
[10:22:21] <Stereo> it works! <3 Eviltwin and djQuery
[10:22:40] <Zackko> djQuery: did you get my jsfiddle link?
[10:23:02] <mh__> hi.. im using .ajax to try and get some data from a homemade API that i've made.. now to the authentication i use basic access authentitaion, and all o have to do is set the header: Authorization: Basic ******, is that possible, i've read some docs saying put xhr.setrequestheader('HEADER', 'VALUE'); in beforeSend in the ajax call, but when i do a check on the webserver.. the requested header never reach the webserver. any suggestions?
[10:24:19] <djQuery> Zackdont think so
[10:25:53] <Zackko> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/CUL6p/3/
[10:26:18] <Zackko> its updated exact code, but still might not be functional cuz theres so much else going on thats unrealted to the issue
[10:26:49] <mh__> i've just tested with the accept header, and it was overwritten without any problems.. are there some limit for which headers i can set in this method?
[10:27:09] <Zackko> I FIXED IT lolâ€¦i just forgot to update a classname and it was causing the issue. very unpredictable lol
[10:27:35] <__n1v3K> god my back hurts
[10:30:55] <ColKurtz> What's faster, selectors or dom traversal methods?
[10:31:45] <Rembane> ColKurtz: Use the one that fits your style of programming best.
[10:34:09] <Stereo> is using element id's quicker than calling them by name?
[10:34:55] <Stereo> or by class
[10:37:46] <warrenparsons> Stereo: Yes, but only marginally. In 99.99% of cases it won't matter.
[10:38:53] <Stereo> thanks warrenparsons :)
[10:39:06] <Stereo> now my jquery chokes on sending $(this).attr('name') : $(this).is(':checked') over json
[10:39:31] <Stereo> Unexpected tokes this, it says
[10:39:57] <warrenparsons> Stereo: I should say the difference itself isn't marginal. It's significant. But it's mostly academic. In most singular cases, the performance difference won't be detectable.
[10:40:10] <Stereo> I want to send foo: true if I check an <input type="checkbox" name="foo">
[10:40:34] <Stereo> warrenparsons: I guess I'll worry about it if my pages are slow, and not a second before
[10:41:03] <warrenparsons> Stereo: Yep, it's always good to code with performance in the back of your mind. But don't jump through premature hoops for it.
[10:41:34] <teaves_> The data parameter to getJSON is mucking with my data
[10:41:46] <teaves_> more specifically, it seems to be turning double spaces into single spaces
[10:42:18] <jcrawford> hey guys why would these 2 lines of code return undefined?
[10:42:24] <jcrawford> var jqSelects = $('select', nRow); alert(jqSelects[0].selectedIndex.value); return;
[10:42:42] <jcrawford> if I alert the selectedIndex that works just fine, but it won't let me get to the value attribute of the option tag
[10:42:48] <josh9> i have array of elements that i get from $('.myclass'). i try to investigate and see what are those elements. i use  $.each(elements, function(index, value) {
[10:42:50] <tfitts> can anyone recommend a good jquery plugin that lets you add ajax calls to the browser history so the back button will take them back to the last call basically?
[10:42:50] <snover> jcrawford: do you know what a number is?
[10:42:54] <josh9> alert(index + ': ' + value.toSource());
[10:43:20] <josh9> and get the attributes of each element instead of the element itself. any idea?
[10:43:24] <jcrawford> snover what do you mean by that question?
[10:45:37] <ColKurtz> How would one add an html entity like &nbsp; using javascript?
[10:45:38] <snover> jcrawford: I mean selectedIndex is a number, so why in the world would you ever think it has a value property?
[10:45:39] <jcrawford> anyone that could lend a hand I would appreciate it :)
[10:45:54] <jcrawford> snover I was not sure if the object did a string conversion :)
[10:45:58] <jcrawford> when you output it.
[10:46:00] <snover> ?alert
[10:46:01] <bot-t> Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[10:46:33] <jcrawford> so how can I get to the value of the drop down in this case ?
[10:46:35] <josh9> snover: it's a samsung tv browser.
[10:46:51] <snover> ?mdc htmlselectelement @ jcrawford
[10:46:52] <bot-t> jcrawford, HTMLSelectElement - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLSelectElement
[10:47:13] <jcrawford> thanks
[10:47:53] <snover> jcrawford: also, there is this library called jQuery that has some convenience functions for dealing with forms, you might want to look at its documentation too
[10:47:58] <jcrawford> omg simple as using .value rather than .selectedINdex
[10:48:07] <jcrawford> snover I am using JQuery
[10:48:17] <jcrawford> and I cannot use the form stuff at this time because I am manipulating DataTables
[10:53:09] <mrgreenfur> anyone know if it's possible to use the new HTML5 input type of 'range' to make a slider with two handles (something jquery-ui does easily)?
[10:54:58] <Andreas___> can anyone help with jquery and restful services?
[10:57:09] <mrgreenfur> Andreas___: What's your question? I might be able to help
[11:04:30] <Stereo> what's the event I should catch when I press enter in an input text field?
[11:04:37] <Stereo> .submit seems to only work for forms
[11:04:46] <mrgreenfur> pressing enter submits the form
[11:05:01] <dabear> Stereo: keypress or keyup
[11:05:04] <Stereo> hmm, so I should wrap that <input> in a <form> ?
[11:05:22] <dabear> check if e.which == 13 and you know enter is pressed
[11:05:35] <dw> $('#your_input').keypress(function(e) { if(e.which == 13) { ... } });  or something
[11:05:59] <mrgreenfur> kind of clumsy tho? I'd wrap it in a form if you're trying to simulate form entry
[11:06:33] <Stereo> ah
[11:06:50] <Stereo> how would I stop the browser from actually submitting the form though?
[11:07:07] <smplstk> bind the submit
[11:07:12] <smplstk> and use e.preventDefault()
[11:07:24] <Stereo> all right, I'll try that
[11:09:11] <Stereo> oh, or return false; seems to do the trick
[11:11:10] <smplstk> Stereo: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/ZcAgx/
[11:11:20] <smplstk> ya, return false will work too.
[11:13:33] <Stereo> smplstk: thanks :)
[11:13:55] <Stereo> I think I rather like the form thing. Who knows how people will submit forms.
[11:14:08] <Stereo> that way I don't have to worry about people pressing the Go button on their phone or something
[11:15:15] <smplstk> Stereo: ya - exactly, even if it has a submit button, it will not function
[11:16:38] <smplstk> Stereo: updated to illustrate: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/ZcAgx/
[11:18:01] <Stereo> indeed
[11:18:10] <Stereo> I got it to work with a form, thank you all!
[11:18:28] <Stereo> I'm still stuck with the data I'm sending over ajax though
[11:18:47] <Stereo> $(this).attr('name') : $(this).is(':checked') doesn't work
[11:19:17] <Stereo> I'd like to do this so that <input type="checkbox" name="foo"> will send foo: true when checked
[11:19:44] <Stereo> and I can find nothing about doing something like that to the key in the documentation, or by googling
[11:19:47] <Stereo> any ideas?
[11:20:39] <EdwardIII> hey
[11:20:59] <EdwardIII> success function doesn't seem to be getting called even though the ajax resource is returning 200 according to chrome  network resources? https://gist.github.com/1368035
[11:21:32] <EdwardIII> tried hiking up the timeout to 35000 by way of a guess as the ajax replace does take a long time to complete on dev machine (c. 25s)
[11:21:46] <ColKurtz> is it okay to put a $(window).load inside of a $(document).ready?
[11:22:27] <phlp> Stereo: you can do var data = {}; data[$(this).attr('name')] = $(this).is(':checked');
[11:24:05] <Stereo> phlp: that looks good. How do I do this inside an ajax call though? Should I build my data before, and use that in the ajax call?
[11:24:16] <phlp> yes
[11:24:19] <smplstk> Stereo, phlp, or instead of doing that, use .serialize http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[11:24:40] <Eviltwin> Stereo: http://jsfiddle.net/JzuGk/ ?
[11:25:35] <Stereo> yeah, I have lots of checkboxes, so I just want to send the one I changed
[11:25:44] <Stereo> serialize looks like it might send the whole nine yards
[11:25:56] <phlp> and serialize wont be true/false
[11:26:02] <Stereo> Eviltwin: yeah, that works too, not as elegant though :)
[11:26:04] <datlap> i have a page site.com/help/ which has 2 tabs /help/#a and /help/#b how can i link to /help/#b directly?
[11:26:14] <Eviltwin> Stereo: Wasn't sure what you were trying for
[11:26:24] <datlap> I m using bootstrap-tabs.js
[11:26:26] <Eviltwin> .serialize() and .serializeArray() don't show anything for unchecked checkboxes
[11:26:45] <Stereo> I want my ajax to call update?foo=true when I check the name=foo checkbox
[11:26:57] <Stereo> looks like the think phlp suggested will work
[11:30:50] <Stereo> phlp: how would you call data[] in the ajax method?
[11:31:00] <Stereo> data: data[] doesn't work at all
[11:31:22] <Eviltwin> ?
[11:32:20] <Stereo> $.ajax({url:'update', data: data[]})
[11:32:28] <phlp> lose the []
[11:32:30] <Stereo> I'm probably showing my newbieshness here :)
[11:32:31] <Eviltwin> Why are you adding []'s randomly?
[11:32:31] <Stereo> oh
[11:32:38] <Stereo> dunno, they're nice characters
[11:33:14] <Stereo> fantastic, it works just like I want it to :)
[11:34:02] <Stereo> I think I tried it without the [] at first but it didn't work because of another syntax error
[11:34:19] <bitwise_> is there a predecessor for jQuery BBQ?
[11:34:48] <EdwardIII> ah, success checks for valid JSON, not just a valid http response
[11:34:51] * EdwardIII takes rest of the day off
[11:35:04] <Stereo> EdwardIII: have fun :)
[11:37:59] <fission6> anyone use knockoutjs?
[11:39:23] <DanGer> hello guys, any idea why this $("#from").keypress(function (event) { does not trigger on <input type="text" name="from" id="from" placeholder="OdkiaÄ¾"> ?
[11:39:59] <katnegermis> Good evening guys :)
[11:40:30] <Eviltwin> DanGer: Do you have more than one thing with and ID of form?
[11:42:02] <katnegermis> I'm having trouble using jquery-ui autocomplete function together with the hotkey-plugin. It seems as if they conflict, so that the jquery-ui autocomplete wont work, if I include the jquery-hotkey.js file.
[11:43:12] <DanGer> Eviltwin: no, not really.
[11:43:54] <DanGer> Eviltwin: I have in the other place of the code $("#from").val(''); and that works fine
[11:45:38] <Eviltwin> DanGer: http://jsfiddle.net/qvLBE/
[11:45:44] <Eviltwin> Works fine for me
[11:45:47] <tomasm-> hi, i'm trying to set up some sort of queueing system where multiple items are added to a list and then each removed from the list, and only once ALL items are removed from the list does it trigger a function call..... i tried setting an Array(), and assigning values based on items[key] = true;, but it seems to have other properties, functions, etc.... how do i create an array object and properly set/get/clear values in it?
[11:46:20] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: Look at .hasOwnProperty
[11:46:28] <Eviltwin> And use [] instead of new Array();
[11:47:01] <Eviltwin> And actually
[11:47:07] <Eviltwin> Since you're doing key -> value mappings
[11:47:10] <Eviltwin> Use an object instead
[11:47:11] <Eviltwin> {}
[11:47:12] <Whirl3d> bitwise, what do you mean?
[11:47:29] <bitwise_> Whirl3d: looks like the project has gone dark?
[11:47:41] <b0ot> how would I pass the data from my php classes to jquery, and vice versa?
[11:48:06] <Eviltwin> b0ot: Look at json_encode and json_decode
[11:48:11] <hightekvagabond> bOot: Json is your friend
[11:48:13] <Whirl3d> I think it's still the standard (dare I say only) way to handle pre-html5 url state changes?
[11:48:23] <ajpiano> bitwise_: predecessor means "something that came before it"
[11:48:38] <ajpiano> bitwise_: BBQ still works great as is though
[11:48:39] <b0ot> Eviltwin, hightekvagabond I have to use xml
[11:48:40] <bitwise_> doh
[11:48:40] <Eviltwin> b0ot: And JSON.parse and JSON.stringify
[11:48:48] <ajpiano> bitwise_: but if you want something a little more forward-looking, check out History.js
[11:48:51] <ajpiano> ?g balupton history.js github
[11:48:52] <bot-t> ajpiano, balupton/history.js - GitHub - https://github.com/balupton/History.js/
[11:49:01] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, do i still assign to an object like obj[key] = val; ? and can i just do a for IN to loop through the keys (ie not interfering with methods)
[11:49:05] <bitwise_> ah yeah was thinking that might be a little more robust (History.js)
[11:49:54] <Eviltwin> yogurt_truck: Yup just also make sure you check .hasOwnProperty(key)
[11:50:04] <bitwise_> i guess 'descendant' was the word i was looking for
[11:50:16] <ajpiano> bitwise_: "successor" was the word you were looking for :)
[11:50:24] <bitwise_> ahha
[11:50:49] <yogurt_truck> Eviltwin: will do, I guess...
[11:51:05] <bitwise_> thx.. i should know this stuff. been speaking english for a long time
[11:51:22] <Eviltwin> That was for tomasm-, my bad
[11:51:30] <Eviltwin> Mis completed
[11:51:33] <yogurt_truck> :>
[11:53:15] <TheEternalAbyss> hello
[11:53:45] <TheEternalAbyss> can someone explain to me why jquery would fail to load?
[11:54:51] <mattyh88> hey, i have a simple html form with a submit btn. when i press it now it reloads the page. i would just like to not reload the page, but post the data with ajax. (i have done that already), but for some reason it doesn't send me an email:
[11:54:52] <mattyh88> http://pastebin.com/2PVPS6pd
[11:55:07] <VeXii> TheEternalAbyss: yes you got a error on line 2
[11:55:16] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, how do I remove a property (key/value) from an object? unset? delete? null? undefined?
[11:55:25] <TheEternalAbyss> VeXii: ?
[11:55:54] <tomasm-> mattyh88, your submit button or form needs to return false to stop the default action
[11:56:05] <VeXii> TheEternalAbyss:  got a link or somthing? :p
[11:56:11] <TheEternalAbyss> lol ohhhhh
[11:56:14] <TheEternalAbyss> yea one sec

[11:58:58] <ajpiano> TheEternalAbyss: that's what that error would indicate, is all i'm saying...
[11:59:15] <VeXii> i dont get errors
[11:59:18] <TheEternalAbyss> ajpiano: i appreciate it, but honestly i'm not sure what it all means
[11:59:24] <VeXii> but the site loades jQuery
[11:59:30] <ajpiano> TheEternalAbyss: do you know what a chrome extension is
[11:59:38] <TheEternalAbyss> yes i know of them
[11:59:40] <ajpiano> yes
[11:59:46] <ajpiano> imagine that they have SPECIAL POWERS
[11:59:52] <TheEternalAbyss> ok
[11:59:53] <ajpiano> and you're trying to use their special powers form your code...maybe
[12:00:05] <TheEternalAbyss> interesting
[12:00:05] <ajpiano> but maybe that's just not your code happening at all
[12:00:15] <ajpiano> i was just trying to explain that stuff you pasted
[12:00:22] <TheEternalAbyss> i see
[12:00:34] <TheEternalAbyss> well I downloaded the jquery plugin
[12:00:43] <TheEternalAbyss> so the author must be doing something weird
[12:00:51] <mattyh88> Thomasm: where do i put that return false?
[12:01:47] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: delete
[12:01:49] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, what cookie solution do you use?
[12:01:52] <TheEternalAbyss> i guess I'll have to go with some other gallery cause i'm not going to debug someone elses code (especially since i'm not all that well versed in jquery to begin with)
[12:01:56] <TheEternalAbyss> thanks for all the assistance
[12:02:06] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: jquery.cookie plugin, if i must?
[12:02:32] <Whirl3d> hrmm, thanks for the reply.
[12:04:18] <ryanneufeld> .
[12:04:38] <Eviltwin> Who still has problems?
[12:04:39] <tomasm-> is there an easy way to check an object if it has any properties or not? without looping
[12:05:33] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: var hassomething = false; for(var k in object) if(object.hasOwnProperty(k)) { hassomething = false; break; }
[12:05:49] <solars> hey, how does pjax work, does it fetch the full page in the background and apply only the updates to the current?
[12:05:52] <solars> or how is that done
[12:05:58] <tomasm-> i said without looping... =P
[12:06:18] <ryanneufeld> tomasm-: hasOwnProperty
[12:06:24] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: Has no keys
[12:06:42] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: This won't keep looking after its found something
[12:06:51] <ryanneufeld> oic
[12:06:55] <Eviltwin> And if the only properties are own properties, it will not loop more than once
[12:07:01] <mattyh88> tomasm: i've added the return false beneath the ajax bit, but still reloading
[12:07:14] <Eviltwin> The only other way is to perhaps keep a counter of the number of keys you've added
[12:07:36] <Eviltwin> Add to it and subtract from it as needed
[12:08:50] <phlp> tomasm-: if you are wanting a queue why not just use .push and .shift on an array?
[12:09:09] <Eviltwin> If it's strictly a FIFO queue, then you should definitely be using an array
[12:09:43] <Eviltwin> (In other words, if order matters, use an array)
[12:10:01] <phlp> ?eval var a = []; a.push('first'); a.push('second'); a.shift();
[12:10:02] <bot-t> phlp: "first"
[12:13:45] <boaseter> Hm.. shouldnt iterating through something like [[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]] , work as $.each(theObject, function(){ alert($(this).objectVariable); }); ?
[12:14:10] <VeXii> dont think the each sets this
[12:14:32] <VeXii> but youre function gets 2 parameters index and objecy
[12:15:01] <Eviltwin> .each does set this
[12:15:03] <VeXii> so the $.each(theObject, function(i, obj) { console.log(obj)})
[12:15:30] <fission6> can i bind to a click even on an image id?
[12:15:41] <Eviltwin> this == obj for objects and arrays
[12:15:56] <VeXii> $("#imageID").click(function(){})
[12:15:57] <Eviltwin> this === obj *
[12:15:58] <boaseter> but also if i do ..  for(item in objectCollection) { var somobjVar = item.namedVar; }, item is "0" as well
[12:16:09] <Eviltwin> boaseter: It operates on keys
[12:16:17] <Eviltwin> You do objectCollection[item] to get the value
[12:16:40] <boaseter> ooh
[12:17:16] <VeXii> remimber the hasOwnProperty
[12:20:03] <Eviltwin> boaseter: http://jsfiddle.net/gKL8b/
[12:20:04] <fission6> how would i change the id name of something?
[12:20:12] <Eviltwin> fission6: The id or the name?
[12:20:32] <fission6> id
[12:20:47] <fission6> i am swapping between a current and a next div, which toggle based on a button click
[12:20:52] <fission6> i want to swap ids
[12:21:37] <Eviltwin> Shuffling IDs around isn't really good practice...
[12:22:40] <Eviltwin> You can .attr("id") to get the ID and .attr("id","foo") to set the ID to foo
[12:23:48] <mattyh88> i'm trying to do a post of my simple html form, but it's not doing it. it's even reloading the page whilst i'm trying to post with ajax:
[12:23:48] <mattyh88> http://pastebin.com/ycAzMp32
[12:24:42] <the_new_you_> hello, if given a string of HTML, what the 'easiest' way to determine an if an element id is present using jquery dom traversal?
[12:24:56] <Eviltwin> mattyh88: Try $("#contactForm").submit(false);
[12:25:28] <Eviltwin> Or using $("#contactForm").submit instead of $("#verzenden").click
[12:27:40] <mattyh88> Eviltwin: still no luck :(
[12:28:10] <Eviltwin> mattyh88: Did you try both of those things? (separately)
[12:28:11] <Gho5t> how can I create a callback for when jquery.validate validate method errors
[12:29:11] <mattyh88> Eviltwin: yes .. i just deleted "data" (the param) in the onsuccess function
[12:29:13] <mattyh88> and now it works
[12:29:21] <mattyh88> how can i pass the returned data then to the function
[12:29:55] <Eviltwin> You want function(data) { printMessage(data) } instead of printMessage(data)
[12:30:12] <Eviltwin> Have you done asynchronous programming before?
[12:30:14] <mattyh88> ah okay :)
[12:30:30] <mattyh88> yeah
[12:30:34] <Eviltwin> mattyh88: You could probably also do just printMessage instead
[12:31:59] <Eviltwin> Do you know the difference between function(data) { foo(data); } or just foo
[12:32:01] <Eviltwin> And foo(data) ?
[12:32:05] <Eviltwin> In this context
[12:32:56] <Eviltwin> http://pastebin.com/rJV1npsz
[12:33:01] <Eviltwin> Why is the first one wrong and the other two right?
[12:33:05] <kollapse> Hi. How does jquery create its objects? I would like to know a jquery object's structure. For example what keys does $("div") use ?
[12:33:12] <bot-t> mattyh88, I do! http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[12:33:36] <Eviltwin> kollapse: It's really a closer relative of an Array than an Object
[12:33:54] <Eviltwin> If there are three divs, $("div").length == 3
[12:33:59] <Eviltwin> And $("div")[0] is the first one
[12:34:04] <Eviltwin> $("div")[1] is the second
[12:34:09] <Eviltwin> $("div")[2] is the third
[12:34:19] <Eviltwin> $("div")[3] is undefined (and so are the larger numbers)
[12:34:23] <kollapse> Eviltwin: Oh, right, thanks. I forgot that typeof in JS returns object for arrays too.
[12:34:51] <Eviltwin> Then it has a bunch of functions
[12:34:55] <mattyh88> Eviltwin: okay got it! thx :)
[12:35:47] <DanGer> is there a way to use <form> on jsfiddle.net?
[12:35:55] <Eviltwin> DanGer: Meaning what?
[12:36:39] <DanGer> Eviltwin: whenever I put <form> into the html field and try to run the code, it gives me "    "error": "Please use POST request"" in the result field
[12:36:54] <Eviltwin> Are you setting a <form> action?
[12:37:09] <DanGer> just action=""
[12:37:12] <Eviltwin> You need to tell forms where to go
[12:37:16] <Eviltwin> action="" means the same page
[12:37:29] <Gho5t> how can I add a callback to the jquery .validate plugin when it is invalid?  This won't work: $('#loginForm').validate({ onInvalid: function () { alert('sup');  });
[12:37:35] <Eviltwin> Which won't work because jsFiddle relies on POSTs to generate them
[12:37:52] <Eviltwin> DanGer: I suggest you look at someting like postbin
[12:38:34] <Gho5t> come on dog
[12:38:35] <Gho5t> come on dog
[12:38:37] <Gho5t> how can I add a callback to the jquery .validate plugin when it is invalid?  This won't work: $('#loginForm').validate({ onInvalid: function () { alert('sup');  });
[12:38:47] <Eviltwin> Gho5t: Calm down
[12:38:52] <Eviltwin> You're not the only one who needs help
[12:38:56] <Gho5t> sorry
[12:38:57] <Eviltwin> And you're not the first to ask for help
[12:39:02] <Gho5t> been working on this all day
[12:39:20] <Eviltwin> Still doesn't mean your issue is any more important than anyone else's here
[12:39:34] <Gho5t> yep np
[12:39:43] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure .validate() is reactive like that
[12:40:13] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: come on dog
[12:40:58] <Gho5t> reactive?
[12:41:02] <Eviltwin> Gho5t: I see submitHandler and invalidHandler in the examples
[12:41:04] <Eviltwin> http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/mktSignup.js
[12:41:20] <tomasm-> hi, i'm noticing some odd behavior with mousedown() and mousemove().... it would seem that while the mouse cursor is held down, that mousemove only is triggered a few times before it stops being triggered anymore.... i have to click up before it starts being triggered again.... is this preventable? maybe somethin to do with the return code from my handler?
[12:43:43] <Gho5t> Eviltwin: $('#loginForm').validate({ invalidHandler: function () { alert('sup'); } }); ?
[12:43:49] <Gho5t> doesn't seem to work either
[12:43:58] <Eviltwin> I'm not terribly familiar with the plugin, sorry
[12:44:11] <Eviltwin> Maybe try adding the debug:true ?
[12:44:27] <Eviltwin> Maybe it'll yield some helpful information
[12:45:29] <Gho5t> god forbid they document their events
[12:45:37] <Gho5t> biggest plugin in the world
[12:45:38] <Gho5t> and once again shitty documentation
[12:45:56] <tomasm-> ah! seems that after the mouse is held down for 2 seconds, it switches from mousemove to drag events
[12:46:16] <Guest91596> Hey guys, need help with this autocomplete piece. Not sure what is going wrong really. http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/DryN9/2/
[12:46:19] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: ya there?
[12:46:20] <bot-t> (22 hours 20 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell Dave_Stein everything has to be compatible with 1.6+
[12:46:21] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: http://jsfiddle.net/dtZp5/
[12:46:23] <Eviltwin> Seems to work fine for me
[12:46:35] <ajpiano> yep, pretty busy though atm
[12:47:21] <Eviltwin> tomasm-: Are you doing coding for mobile?
[12:47:22] <DanGer> what might be a reason .next() doesn't return anything usable?
[12:47:22] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: had a quick git question. im switching from SVN. I'm used to using tags and buildings tags. But with git do you guys just make branches and always build from trunk? I'm thinking I just need to make branches for each "tag" and merge in when ready
[12:47:23] <Eviltwin> Like iOS?
[12:47:57] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: Have you read this? http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
[12:48:00] <ajpiano> a tag is just an alias for a particular commit, really
[12:48:00] <DanGer> Dave_Stein: git has tags too
[12:48:02] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, no, firefox on linux
[12:48:05] <ajpiano> in git
[12:48:16] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: MY team ended up going with something very simple
[12:48:19] <Eviltwin> similar*
[12:48:23] <Dave_Stein> ill check out that link thanks
[12:48:26] <ajpiano> and typically you're never merging anything onto master yourself
[12:48:40] <ajpiano> because it makes its way there via pull reqeest
[12:48:42] <ajpiano> at least in UI
[12:48:44] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, i tihnk the difference is that i'm doing this on a picture... it has a 'drag' event
[12:48:51] <ajpiano> guess it's different on your own proj
[12:48:55] <xerideas> How do I .each a select element to get all the options (I am removing to repopulate).
[12:49:01] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[12:49:03] <Eviltwin> Generally it's best to have an ongoing master branch
[12:49:08] <Eviltwin> That you never do anything but merge into
[12:49:10] <danzik171> ryanneufeld: ...really...so random =P
[12:49:20] <Eviltwin> And you constantly branch off it for issues
[12:49:20] <Dave_Stein> right and any huge group of changes for the next build would go into a branch
[12:49:21] <ryanneufeld> ?
[12:49:21] <Eviltwin> And merge back
[12:49:27] <ryanneufeld> danzik171: huh?
[12:49:35] <Eviltwin> We adopted a branch-per-issue model
[12:49:38] <danzik171> ryanneufeld: comment in the session going on atm
[12:49:48] <Eviltwin> No commits directly to develop or master
[12:49:49] <Dave_Stein> interesting
[12:49:52] <Dave_Stein> let me look at that big chart
[12:49:52] <ryanneufeld> danzik171: how'd you know that was me?
[12:49:53] <Dave_Stein> :)
[12:49:54] <Eviltwin> Only branches and merges
[12:49:56] <ryanneufeld> lol
[12:50:00] <Eviltwin> Non-ff merges
[12:50:02] <danzik171> ryanneufeld: i know all.
[12:50:10] <ryanneufeld> danzik171: LIES
[12:50:27] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: im just gonna PM you to not spam
[12:50:30] <fission6> is using getJSOn the best means of fetching json data
[12:50:35] <shaft0> Is anyone in here familiar with the colorbox plugin?
[12:51:04] <shaft0> Or familiar with lightbox plugins in general, I suppose, would be a better question.
[12:51:21] <DanGer> I have this piece of code: http://dpaste.org/Bw5mQ/ - any idea why I don't get the focus() on the next input?
[12:52:09] <ColKurtz> Delegate/on won't take a variable for a jquery object? For example, var el = $("#el"); $("#wrapper").delegate(el, "click", function(){ });
[12:54:20] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, i had to disable dragstart and drag on the container as well
[12:57:11] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: what's the difference between a release branch and feature branch? this is probably a silly question
[12:57:33] <Dave_Stein> oh im dumb its below
[12:57:37] <Dave_Stein> :)
[13:00:16] <eXeC64> I moved the body of my code from a <script> tag into a .js file and referenced it using <script src=...> but now it doesn't seem to do anything. It's like js doesn't exist anymore.
[13:00:49] <tomasm-> eXeC64, example?
[13:00:51] <hightekvagabond> are you sure your path and file name are correct?
[13:00:52] <miketaylr> eXeC64: maybe you got the path wrong?
[13:01:22] <hightekvagabond> quick view source and copy and paste the contents of the src into your browser to see if the script shows up
[13:01:39] <eXeC64> Oh, I'm an idiot. Syntax error, it had some python in it, from the templating engine.
[13:02:08] <hightekvagabond> been there
[13:06:43] <fission6> if i am doing getJSON how do i return the data variable back so ic an use it elsewhere in my javascript?
[13:07:30] <kategeek> you use it in the callback
[13:08:31] <fission6> right, i have that working but i need to take that data and use it elsewhere too - outside of the callback.
[13:08:56] <kategeek> you can assign an varible outside of the callback to have its value
[13:09:07] <ColKurtz> What's the best way to preload images? Right now I'm just creating an array, looping through it, and doing images[i] = new Image(); images[i].src = '/path/to/img.jpg';
[13:09:43] <miketaylr> that's pretty much it, ColKurtz
[13:09:51] <Kaapa> ColKurtz: css
[13:10:12] <ColKurtz> tell me more kaapa
[13:10:22] <tomasm-> ColKurtz, how/when does that get attached to the DOM? curious.
[13:10:28] <kategeek> ColKurtz: if it is for a button use a css sprite
[13:10:43] <Kaapa> ColKurtz: http://www.thecssninja.com/css/even-better-image-preloading-with-css2
[13:10:55] <ColKurtz> I have a website that uses a bunch of large photos for the background on each page
[13:11:02] <Kaapa> doesn 't work in ie7... but who cares....
[13:11:41] <ColKurtz> i wanted to preload the images on the home page so that when they go to the next page there won't be such a bad Flash of Unstyled Content
[13:11:58] <ColKurtz> http://fusionsunnyvale.com/
[13:13:31] <tomasm-> ColKurtz, looks like there's a default bg? the same odd picture flickers for a split second on each page.....
[13:14:13] <ColKurtz> yeah i set a default BG in css. the client demanded that I use javascript to resize the BG photo
[13:14:56] <ColKurtz> at the time I set a default bg in css in the interest of uh whatever you call it. being prepared for no js
[13:14:57] <tomasm-> ColKurtz, i would make sure that home.jpg does not load on every page.... if js is loading it, let it deal with it, but the flicker is partially because you change the bg w/js after it's already set w/css
[13:15:07] <hightekvagabond> I'd set the bg to a solid color rather than an image, its a less disturbing flash
[13:15:13] <tomasm-> yes, solid color
[13:16:29] <tomasm-> since much of it is the same, you could also change it all to ajax, and only update the main content after the bg is done loading (onLoad event)
[13:16:46] <tomasm-> then again onLoad might not work for a bg image
[13:17:01] <tomasm-> but your js stretching tool may have a oncomplete callback
[13:18:38] <ColKurtz> ah the boss wouldn't like me spendign time totally redoing the site all ajax
[13:18:55] <ColKurtz> i just had to make a small update and thought i'd throw in a few small improvements while i was at it
[13:18:56] <tomasm-> dark grey bg default is probably the quickest
[13:19:06] <ColKurtz> yep that's what i just did
[13:19:16] <ColKurtz> and now they don't have to download 2 huge photos at the same time either
[13:19:17] <ColKurtz> lol
[13:19:30] <ColKurtz> it was a slightly older site
[13:20:09] <ColKurtz> i could probably even disable that photostretch script on mobile and dark grey would work fine and make the site more speedy
[13:20:37] <ColKurtz> silly ad agency is all obsessed with mobile compatibility now, even though they don't design for it
[13:20:37] <ColKurtz> lol
[13:22:34] <objNoob> Hi, I'm having some troubles getting the .text() function to work in FF. It is working in IE.
[13:22:42] <objNoob> http://pastebin.com/dm0T3jBh
[13:23:17] <objNoob> The block that is not working properly is the false table block
[13:25:49] <maena> if I have a few frames with the same class, the way to remove them is like this, right?: $('.frame').each(function(){ $(this).remove(); });
[13:26:12] <hightekvagabond> I want to fire a function if someone hit's return in an input text fieldâ€¦ is there a special event for that or should I use keypress and check for enter?
[13:26:52] <Rembane> hightekvagabond: keypress or maybe keydown. Check for enter.
[13:27:41] <Rembane> hightekvagabond: Nvm about keydown, keypress is better.
[13:28:55] <hightekvagabond> really? I was just reading keypress and it says that unlike keydown if the user holds down the key it repeatsâ€¦. I don't really want dumb users firing my function over and over because they can't go of a stupid button
[13:30:03] <tomasm-> why keydown vs keyup?
[13:31:18] <Rembane> hightekvagabond, tomasm-: Both these are good reads: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/keys.html http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html
[13:33:23] <tomasm-> ok, keyup will happen after keydown, which ultimately causes the form to submit... so keydown would need to be prevented
[13:34:55] <hightekvagabond> thanks for the articles Rembane, keydown it is
[13:35:03] <Rembane> hightekvagabond: No worries. Have fun! :)
[13:52:14] <streblo> is there a new version of jquery.form for jquery >1.5?
[13:53:56] <streblo> ah, nevermind, there is
[13:55:41] <hightekvagabond> Anyone have any recommendations on floating header plugins for tables? I see 3 of them out thereâ€¦
[13:59:53] <winterpk> Hi everyone
[13:59:54] <Rushing> anyone know why the scroll event doesn't fire in chrome if you click the scroll bar directly or use page up/down?
[14:00:04] <Rushing> i'm binding to $(window).scroll
[14:00:21] <winterpk> Does anyone know the best way to remove all alpha-numerics from a string?
[14:00:38] <winterpk> sorry all NON alpha-numerics
[14:01:03] <Rushing> winterpk, regex
[14:01:23] <Rushing> mystring.replace(/\w/g, "")
[14:01:24] <winterpk> Rushing: whats the most efficient pattern?
[14:01:41] <winterpk> Rushing: thank you
[14:01:41] <Rushing> err, replace(/\W/g, "")
[14:02:45] <Stereo> that should be the most efficient, but try \W+ too
[14:03:08] <Stereo> so that it replaces chunks of letters, and not every single l e t t e r
[14:03:22] <Stereo> I have an odd problem
[14:04:07] <Stereo> calling remove() on my containing <tr>'s id doesn't work inside my $.ajax success function, but works right after it
[14:04:46] <Stereo> and it's not a $(this) context issue, I'm doing the remove directly on the id
[14:04:48] <Stereo> any ideas?
[14:05:21] <Rushing> Stereo, not much info to go off of, but you might try $("[id='whatever']") for your selector
[14:05:28] <Rushing> there might be an ID conflict in the page
[14:05:45] <Stereo> wait, I think I found the reason
[14:05:57] <Stereo> my ajax call isn't successful yet
[14:06:18] <Rushing> yeah :P gotta wait for that deferred object to resolve
[14:06:20] <robin_sz> ok, im trying to find a selector to grab some text <div><span>unwanted</span><div>someting equally unwanted</div>this bit I want</div>
[14:06:53] <Rushing> ?contents @ robin_sz
[14:06:53] <bot-t> robin_sz, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[14:07:20] <robin_sz> Rushing, won that grab the contents of the unwanted span and div as well?
[14:07:35] <Rushing> yes, so then you filter them
[14:07:46] <Rushing> maybe $thing.contents().not("div,span")
[14:08:00] <Rushing> don't work with contents() much though, so can't say for sure if that'll work, but i think so
[14:08:18] <robin_sz> hmm, I'll have a play
[14:10:04] <Rushing> man, chrome has been such a piece the last month...keeps just loading pages partially, then spins forever. have to close out of all my windows and restart it...
[14:12:32] <robin_sz> hmm
[14:20:24] <mrryanjohnston> if I do a jQuery(document).click, is there any way I can alert what element was clicked?
[14:21:20] <robin_sz> what was that site that was a really cool jquery / pastbin mashup that let you execute and share jquery / html / javascript ??
[14:21:43] <mrryanjohnston> robin_sz: jsfiddle?
[14:21:49] <robin_sz> ooh ta
[14:21:54] <mrryanjohnston> think it's in the topic
[14:29:13] <mrryanjohnston> ah, ok, better question:
[14:29:49] <mrryanjohnston> If I have a dropdown appear on my page which contains a div, will this div be effected if I have $('div').click() in my js?
[14:30:49] <jwm> yes?
[14:30:57] <jwm> you mean will it work?
[14:31:22] <Guest91596> Hey guys, i am doing an %.each($('input.topic'),function(i){....} and when I do a $(this).css('border','thin solid green'), all of my .topics are getting updated. How do I get just THIS element, and not the array of .topic elements
[14:31:56] <mrryanjohnston> jwm: yes, mostly.
[14:32:04] <mrryanjohnston> jwm: as of right now, I'm unable to get it to work.
[14:32:34] <phlp> mrryanjohnston: depends whether that line is before or after the appear and whether appear means append or show (already in dom)
[14:32:35] <ccmonster> its here - http://pastie.org/2869396
[14:33:06] <mrryanjohnston> phlp: the line is before the div appears. I'm not sure what append / show refers to.
[14:33:44] <phlp> what's the code that makes it appear
[14:34:04] <jwm> Guest19686: hasclass
[14:34:18] <jwm> or just set an id on the input
[14:34:20] <mrryanjohnston> phlp: unfortunately, I'm not too sure. This is in a Drupal system using an autocomplete_path, if you're familiar with that
[14:34:51] <robin_sz> sigh
[14:34:56] <robin_sz> http://jsfiddle.net/dVLKn/10/
[14:35:15] <robin_sz> what im trying to do is suck out the zipcode and country
[14:35:24] <JesperA> jag gillar hÃ¤star
[14:36:27] <mrryanjohnston> phlp: I do have the html hierarchy, though, via firebug, so I was attempting to reach it via 'div ul'
[14:36:32] <mrryanjohnston> however, it wasn't responding to that
[14:38:22] <mrryanjohnston> phlp: is there a way to do this 'append' thing you were talking about? because I guess it only does that for items on (document).ready, right?
[14:39:25] <phlp> mrryanjohnston: you might want to look at .live or .delegate if you use straight .click the div has to be on the page when the code is executed for it to work. if it is appended later the event wont be bound
[14:43:11] <robin_sz> hmm, can;t get .content().not('span').text(); to work .. jsfiddle doesnt seem to like it
[14:44:15] <josh9> i have a dom element, value. how to print it's parent? $(value).parent() showes me object
[14:46:08] <ChrisPartridge> josh9: a dom element value? or an actual dom element?
[14:47:49] <josh9> ChrisPartridge: i think it's actual dom element, since i can do .innerHTML
[14:48:34] <ChrisPartridge> josh9: and parent() isn't working?
[14:48:41] <Spadeski> anyone got some kewl draggable examples i can use?
[14:48:53] <josh9> ChrisPartridge: it's working but i see object object. how to display it's content?
[14:49:08] <josh9> ChrisPartridge: btw, i do $(value).parent()
[14:49:34] <Spadeski> josh9 $() would that automate it to this.value ?
[14:50:04] <josh9> Spadeski: i don't understand your question
[14:50:22] <Spadeski> like $(value) would that be $(this.value)
[14:50:25] <Spadeski> by default
[14:50:27] <josh9> Spadeski: can i do value.parent() ?
[14:50:43] <josh9> even though value is not jquery object?
[14:50:47] <Eviltwin> What's up?
[14:50:47] <Spadeski> nah nvm
[14:50:49] <ChrisPartridge> what type of object is the parent()? what value do you want from it? the html?
[14:51:03] <josh9> ChrisPartridge: the parent is an li
[14:51:16] <Eviltwin> $(<DOM Element>).parent()[0] is a DOM Element
[14:51:32] <josh9> ChrisPartridge: i want to print it - <li class="bla"></li
[14:51:47] <josh9> Eviltwin: let me try
[14:52:50] <Eviltwin> $(...) will return a collection of elements as a jQuery object (which is similar to an array but with extra helper functions)
[14:53:04] <Eviltwin> The $(...) can be treated as a pseudo array
[14:53:18] <Eviltwin> i.e. it has a .length property that is an integer and represents the number of elements
[14:53:34] <Eviltwin> It has a .slice() function which lets you get a subset of the elements in a particular range
[14:53:45] <josh9> Eviltwin: now i see [obeject HTMLLIELEMENT]
[14:53:51] <Eviltwin> And it has all of the elements at indices 0 up to but not including length
[14:53:56] <Eviltwin> That can be accessed [0] [1] [2] etc
[14:54:04] <Eviltwin> josh9: Congratulations! You have a DOM element!
[14:54:22] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: just fyi, you are awesome
[14:54:28] <josh9> Eviltwin: so now i need .toSource() ?
[14:54:32] <ajpiano> really appreciate all your work lately helping out  :)
[14:54:37] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Thanks, no problem
[14:54:49] <Eviltwin> josh9: I kinda came in in the middle of this
[14:54:52] <Eviltwin> What's the larger issue
[14:54:58] <Eviltwin> I thought you were trying to get a DOM element
[14:55:04] <josh9> Eviltwin: displaying it's content
[14:55:08] <Eviltwin> How?
[14:55:10] <Eviltwin> As HTML?
[14:55:13] <Eviltwin> As test?
[14:55:14] <Eviltwin> text*
[14:55:18] <josh9> <li><bla> </li>
[14:55:23] <josh9> on the console
[14:55:25] <Eviltwin> Okay, that's HTML
[14:55:29] <josh9> yeah
[14:55:33] <Eviltwin> So you can either do $(...).html()
[14:55:38] <Eviltwin> Or $(...)[0].innerHTML
[14:55:57] <Eviltwin> If you want to include the element itself (which is not technically part of the element's contents)
[14:56:02] <Eviltwin> You can use $(...)[0].outerHTML
[14:56:42] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: I think I'm owed a couple dozen beers by various people now
[14:56:42] <josh9> Eviltwin: works. thanks
[14:56:51] <Eviltwin> In exchange for help
[14:56:55] <ajpiano> haha
[14:57:10] <ajpiano> somewhere there is a big bar up in the sky waiting for all of us
[14:57:15] <Eviltwin> Heh, yeah
[14:57:32] <Spadeski> anyone got some kewl draggable examples i can use?
[14:57:32] <Eviltwin> As a joke I set up a pledgie so people could actually make good on their promises of beer
[14:57:36] <Eviltwin> Someone actually dontated a dollar
[14:57:47] <Eviltwin> Spadeski: Dragging what to what?
[14:57:54] <Spadeski> anything doesnt matter
[14:58:05] <Eviltwin> Using .draggable or whatever?
[14:58:21] <Spadeski> yup
[14:58:26] <Spadeski> just something to mess with
[14:58:30] <Eviltwin> So it should be .draggable or no?
[14:58:36] <Spadeski> true
[14:58:39] <Spadeski> lol
[14:58:52] <Eviltwin> Uh, that was a yes or no question
[14:58:57] <Eviltwin> Should I use jQuery .draggable or not?
[14:58:59] <Spadeski> Yep
[14:59:14] <Spadeski> Yeah I just wanna get into that make it simple if ya woudl
[14:59:24] <Spadeski> maybe show how to get the order or something
[14:59:25] <Eviltwin> Here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ :P
[14:59:31] <Spadeski> even better
[15:00:06] <Spadeski> hmm, doesnt help << doing this for ideas
[15:00:11] <Eviltwin> Take a look at Draggable + Sortable
[15:01:00] <phlp> robin_sz: http://jsfiddle.net/dVLKn/12
[15:01:17] <Spadeski> that was good
[15:01:35] <Spadeski>  cant believe i didnt notice the options to the right of the site
[15:01:52] <Spadeski> phlp that was a kewl one
[15:02:55] <bgy> hi
[15:03:34] <Spadeski> Eviltwin anyway to make it have to be in a sortable for that example ? and limit the number it can have
[15:04:22] <Eviltwin> Spadeski: Read the sortable docs: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[15:04:29] <Eviltwin> I don't use either with any great frequency
[15:04:56] <Spadeski> ah alright should've specified thought you were like grand master over there givin me hese instant references
[15:05:15] <Eviltwin> It's called Google
[15:05:40] <Eviltwin> Regardless of my own expertise in the matter, I try to steer people towards docs that I think will be helpful
[15:06:28] <Spadeski> Oh I do I meant no disrespect there awesome lol
[15:07:07] <Eviltwin> Try to find the example closest to what you're trying to do and read the source in detail
[15:07:18] <Eviltwin> Then browse events, options, and methods looking for other things that sound like they might be helpful
[15:07:22] <robin_sz> phlp: looking
[15:07:45] <Eviltwin> That's what I do when I'm trying to use jQuery UI
[15:08:01] <Eviltwin> Which I believe there is an entire additional channel for
[15:08:07] <Eviltwin> #jqueryui or something
[15:09:56] <robin_sz> phlp: OK, yeah just grab it and parse it.  I was hoping to narrow down the content as much as possible, as it happens im not actually using Javascript, im using Jquery in php, so I have the usual PHP  trim/split/preg_match etc to play with
[15:10:50] <robin_sz> phpQuery is pretty awesome .. easily the best way to slice and dice scraped content
[15:11:33] <robin_sz> all the power of jquery in a server-side language :)
[15:15:28] <VeXii> jsDom + jQuery imho
[15:17:52] <robin_sz> waht would be good, is to select the text nodes that are not inside <span> tags
[15:28:06] <zingbats> Quick obvious question... If I have a jQuery UI dialog, and the button params are {buttonName: function() {},...} and I want to create a dialog with a function, example function(buttonNameVar) { ... {buttonNameVar: func() {} ... }}    How can I get the button to say the VALUE of "buttonNameVar" rather than the word "buttonNameVar"... have tried String(buttonNameVar) to no effect.
[15:33:33] <VeXii> dont use " arund the variable? :p
[15:34:06] <coldhead> don't like to hear the word vampire
[15:51:17] <jhgaylor> hey all.  I am trying to bubble sort div's by their id.  they all share a common class.  i want to actually move the elements in the dom.  any suggestions?
[15:52:57] <jhgaylor> circle, i swear bro, u dc more than anyone else in the world
[15:53:16] <skamikaze> ?sortable @ jhgaylor
[15:53:16] <bot-t> jhgaylor, UI/API/1.8/Sortable - The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortable
[15:54:47] <jhgaylor> skamikaze: Kinda.  I need to do it on the backend, with no user interaction. I am sure that going into their plugin and reverse engineering the process would be more work than necessary.
[15:55:20] <jhgaylor> I feel like I should be able to make an array of elements with a selector like var foo = $('.class') and work with them as elements of foo, but that doesn't work
[15:55:43] <ajpiano> jhgaylor: you can do that, i will make you a quick demo that i barely will have time to explain
[15:56:11] <jhgaylor> thanks AJ.
[15:56:29] <jhgaylor> I heard you were the king at working with the UI via jQuery
[15:57:31] <ajpiano> i've been known to dabble
[15:57:32] <Eviltwin> Is there a particular reason you want to bubble sort?
[15:57:59] <jhgaylor> no.  It was just an easy algorithm to write
[15:58:44] <jhgaylor> i have an example of what i had hoped would work, if anyone would like to see what I tried
[15:58:50] <Eviltwin> Sure
[15:59:26] <jhgaylor> http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/4/
[15:59:35] <Eviltwin> Pretty sure you're going to need at least one placeholder for it to work
[15:59:50] <jhgaylor> i have one
[16:00:13] <jhgaylor> using clone in this example
[16:05:03] <ajpiano> jhgaylor http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/TxdCY/2/
[16:05:18] <ajpiano> that sorts by inner text but you can sort by anything
[16:05:19] <ajpiano> in the function
[16:05:23] <ajpiano> ?mdc array sort
[16:05:24] <bot-t> ajpiano, sort - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Sorts the elements of an array in place. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[16:06:48] <jhgaylor> so, i just put it in a container and sort the children of the container?
[16:07:26] <jhgaylor> and id just make it return $(a).attr('id')< $(b).attr('id') if i wanted to compare attributes
[16:07:52] <ajpiano> pretty much
[16:08:09] <jhgaylor> that's pretty. I like it.  Thank you
[16:08:36] <ChrisPartridge> very sexy code ajpiano
[16:08:37] <ajpiano> welcome
[16:08:54] <ajpiano> :)
[16:11:41] <bensmithett> There was a post in the last week or so showing faster ways of getting document ready with jquery, but I can't find it. Does that sound familiar to anyone?
[16:16:41] <Mkop> I recall reading somewhere that you can set a callback to run after all the elements in .each() run
[16:16:54] <jhgaylor> When does $(document).ready() run?  Does it wait for my asynchronous stuff to finish?  Someone linked me an awesome commented example of when things load, but I forgot to save it
[16:17:35] <ajpiano> jhgaylor: no it doesn't
[16:18:15] <jhgaylor> Is there a safe way to make sure all my async stuff has finished?
[16:18:54] <ajpiano> use Deferreds
[16:19:02] <ajpiano> hehe
[16:19:16] <ajpiano> that's kind of a big topic though
[16:19:47] <ajpiano> luckily dan is giving a talk on that TOMORROW at the jquery summit if you want to literally have it explained to you LIVE
[16:20:48] <Mkop> ajpiano: did you see my comment a couple days ago? http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide57 links to a jsfiddle which (at least on FF8) does the opposite of what you say it does
[16:21:00] <ajpiano> or you can just read: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/ or watch dan's talk on it from a few months ago http://lanyrd.com/2011/jquery-sf-bay-area/sdptk/
[16:21:06] <ajpiano> Mkop: yeah sorry about that
[16:21:11] <ajpiano> i'm tangentially aware of that
[16:21:16] <Eviltwin> Went for the more abstract in my sort: http://jsfiddle.net/4DNJE/
[16:21:18] <ajpiano> the behaviour is slightly diff in ff
[16:21:22] <Mkop> no problem, wasn't expecting a response. just wanted to make sure you were aware
[16:21:25] <ajpiano> and i haven't fixed the slide
[16:21:58] <Mkop> also, a small usability request: make the slides say [slide num]/[total slides] at the bottom
[16:22:34] <Mkop> especially since there's no visual feedback so a user knows how much further there is to go
[16:22:53] <jhgaylor> Where and when would I need to be to hear this talk?
[16:23:16] <ajpiano> jhgaylor: http://www.environmentsforhumans.com/2011/jquery-summit/
[16:23:38] <ajpiano> you would even get to hear ME speak omg
[16:23:50] <jhgaylor> lol.  i'll explore and see what its gonna cost me
[16:23:57] <jhgaylor> OMG i can get work to pay for it
[16:24:09] <ajpiano> i have a coupon lol
[16:24:17] <ajpiano> i forgot to give them out
[16:24:28] <Mkop> lol
[16:25:04] <molavy>  i want create div that grow automatically width by it contents, but after some growing it stop growing, max growing depend on screen size, but i want make it growing width even it text was about an book
[16:25:15] <molavy> i think's it depend on screen size because when i change screen size max width become smaller , how to solve this issue
[16:25:30] <ajpiano> Mkop: hm, i reckon that can be added in without too much work, i'll see if i can figure it out on the deck i'm doing
[16:26:12] <molavy> any idea?
[16:26:41] <Mkop> ajpiano: how many spare coupons do you have?
[16:26:47] <Mkop> (feel free to PM if you want)
[16:26:53] <ajpiano> 2
[16:27:04] <ajpiano> i'm happy to share
[16:27:06] <ajpiano> 1 sec
[16:30:24] <jhgaylor> wow... that's expensive. :P
[16:31:40] <ajpiano> heh
[16:31:50] <ajpiano> well, he's probably giving mostly the same talk as the one i linked you to :)
[16:32:10] <jhgaylor> I think work will pay for it.  If they will, I'll take the day off to watch my computer screen :D
[16:34:49] <jhgaylor> ajpiano: thought you might like to know I successfully implemented your stuff on a static list.  Now to figure out when to sort the elements my asych crap creates
[16:35:02] <jhgaylor> *googles*
[16:35:10] <Mkop> lesson: hainging out in IRC is worth it!
[16:35:19] <ajpiano> jhgaylor: you could wrap that functionality up in a simple plugin
[16:35:48] <ajpiano> so you can call it on some elemn at any time
[16:35:48] <jhgaylor> <<started learning jQuery Friday.  nothing is simple :P
[16:35:55] <ajpiano> Mkop: true story
[16:36:11] <jhgaylor> i am probably going to just bind the sort to a button.
[16:39:10] <tokam> how to get the first children form element of an existing element?
[16:39:51] <jhgaylor> hmmmm.... $('#formID').first()?
[16:40:06] <coldhead> ?first
[16:40:06] <bot-t> .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[16:40:54] <coldhead> $('form').find(':first')
[16:41:03] <coldhead> that probably only takes 3 hours to run
[16:48:18] <tokam> I need to do a post to the current url. how to get the current url?
[16:48:36] <tokam> or no hold on, I will specify an ajax action for it.
[16:48:56] <jwm> window.location
[16:49:02] <tokam> :)
[16:49:47] <tokam> how to get the action of a form using jquery? I already have the form
[16:50:16] <tokam> ahh attr
[16:50:34] <jhgaylor> http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/6/ is an attempt to implement what AJpiano wrote, and it is failing miserably.  Any idea what i messed up?
[16:51:36] <jhgaylor> It seems to sort, and then disappear off the screen when executed with the rest of my code
[16:52:08] <tokam> this displays undefined alert( editKeywordForm.attr( 'action' ) )
[16:52:16] <tokam> if I display the form I get an object
[16:52:33] <tokam> var editKeywordForm = $('#editkeywords').first( 'form' );
[16:53:06] <jhgaylor>  $('#editkeywords').first().attr( 'form' ); ?
[16:53:11] <jhgaylor> wait... nvm
[16:53:40] <tokam> how to check if the element is valid?
[16:53:54] <jhgaylor> what are you trying to do?
[16:53:59] <jhgaylor> edit the action?
[16:54:19] <tokam> i want to get the action for a jquer post
[16:54:33] <tokam> ajay
[16:54:35] <tokam> ajax
[16:54:53] <jhgaylor> did you post a paste?
[16:55:29] <jhgaylor> ?first
[16:55:30] <bot-t> .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[16:55:42] <tokam> not yet i read the elements from my current markup. but i want to get the action from the form because my js is in a separate file and it gives me the abillity to specify the action in the php controller
[16:55:51] <tokam> the form is only for js because it is in a hidden div anyway
[16:56:07] <ajpiano> jhgaylor: you should definitely look into using jquery's event handling system instead of inline event handlers
[16:56:31] <tokam> so it does not allow a selector?
[16:56:45] <ajpiano> jhgaylor: also if you end up coming tomorrow to the thing, and you stay for the backbone talk, you will learn a completely different way to approach the problem of collections of data in highly dynamic js apps
[16:56:46] <ajpiano> lol
[16:56:50] <jhgaylor> try var editKeywordForm = $('#editkeywords').attr('action')
[16:56:55] * ajpiano is shilling so hard right now inexplicably
[16:57:07] <tokam> var editKeywordForm = $('#editkeywords').children( 'form' )first();?
[16:57:16] <jhgaylor> you're overcomplicating it i think
[16:57:44] * ajpiano should be leaving so hard right now
[16:57:47] <jhgaylor> if your form's id is #editkeywords then you can get to its attributes like $('#editkeywords').attr('attributeName')
[16:57:56] <tokam> jhgaylor: i need the form anyway to serialize it for the post
[16:58:07] <tokam> jhgaylor: it has no id yet
[16:58:26] <jhgaylor> id need to see more of the code to help you
[16:58:45] <ajpiano> $("#foo").find("form").first().attr("action");
[16:58:48] <jhgaylor> ajpiano:if i start about noon am I going to miss anything AWESOME?
[16:59:21] <ajpiano> jhgaylor: i have to roll now, best of luck with your stuff
[16:59:36] <ajpiano> lol you'll miss MY TALK ON THE STATE OF EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING IN JQUERY RIGHT NOW
[16:59:36] <ajpiano> nbd
[16:59:52] <jhgaylor> what timeslot is yours?
[16:59:58] <ajpiano> and dan's thing on dfd i believe
[17:00:00] <ajpiano> im first
[17:00:01] <ajpiano> 10est
[17:00:11] <jhgaylor> lol.  you might be shit outta luck
[17:00:12] <tokam> 		var editKeywordForm = $('#editkeywords').children( 'form' ).first();
[17:00:12] <tokam> 		alert( editKeywordForm.attr( 'action' )	 );
[17:00:14] <tokam> undefined
[17:00:18] <ajpiano> haha
[17:00:19] <ajpiano> ?mlu
[17:00:19] <bot-t> much like urself
[17:00:32] <ajpiano> tokam: you have to check if your selection is finding anything
[17:00:45] <tokam> how?
[17:01:00] <ajpiano> tohttp://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide20
[17:01:03] <ajpiano> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide20
[17:01:09] <tokam> the size is 0
[17:01:16] <ajpiano> it
[17:01:20] <ajpiano> it's not matching anything
[17:01:30] <ajpiano> you have to debug, or get someone to look at the problem more in depth
[17:01:35] <ajpiano> i bid you gentlemen adieu for now
[17:01:43] <tokam> $('#editkeywords') finds something but ...
[17:01:46] <tokam> i do not find the form
[17:01:59] <coldhead> adieu, frenchy
[17:02:21] <tokam> $('#editkeywords').first( 'form' ) this still returns the id's div
[17:02:35] <tokam> i tested it with html() in an alert
[17:02:46] <Eviltwin> $('#id').first() doesn't make any sense
[17:03:04] <Eviltwin> Or .first('selector')
[17:03:09] <jhgaylor> ^agreed
[17:03:11] <tokam> my form does not have an id
[17:04:13] <tokam> how to get the form if it has no id?
[17:04:20] <Eviltwin> Use a different kind of selector?
[17:04:21] <tokam> and is the first form in the box with an id
[17:04:22] <Eviltwin> ?selector
[17:04:23] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Selectors - Each action we perform with jQuery requires a target; for example, in order to hide or show an element on the page, first we must find that element. To do so, we rely on jQuerys selector expression... http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[17:04:41] <tokam> I tried to use this one http://api.jquery.com/element-selector/
[17:05:02] <blindMoe> if I am using .sortable() with two linked lists, is is possible  to not have jquery ui remove the item from list 1 when it is dragged onto list 2?
[17:05:16] <blindMoe> I woud like to be able to move items from list 1 to list 2 as many times as I want
[17:05:46] <tokam> why does not the element selector work how i used it?
[17:06:03] <Eviltwin> bot-t: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
[17:06:05] <bot-t> Eviltwin, jQuery UI - Home - http://ui2.jquery.com/demos/sortable/portlets.html#connect-lists
[17:06:10] <Eviltwin> Err
[17:06:12] <Eviltwin> blindMoe: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
[17:06:15] <blindMoe> hehe
[17:06:47] <Eviltwin> tokam: $('form') builds a collection of all <form>s in the page
[17:07:02] <tokam> ok now I understand this =)
[17:07:03] <blindMoe> Eviltwin: I have the lists working .. the problem is that when you move an item from list 1 to list 2, it removes the item from list 1, I want it to stay in list 1 and be added to list 2
[17:07:16] <tokam> it violates the element selector rule
[17:07:18] <blindMoe> so technically the user could drop item 1 onto list 2 ten different times if they wanted
[17:08:09] <Eviltwin> blindMoe: Take a look at the remove event
[17:08:13] <Eviltwin> You might be able to prevent it
[17:08:18] <tokam> but how to get the form than?
[17:08:21] <blindMoe> ahh thanks
[17:08:34] <Eviltwin> tokam: What violated the element selector rule?
[17:08:36] <tokam> ok i use a class selector
[17:08:54] <tokam> that var editKeywordForm = $('#editkeywords').first( 'form' );
[17:08:56] <tokam> found nothing
[17:08:56] <jhgaylor> anyone got an opinion about the jquery summit?  would i be better off reading about these things or watching the videos after the fact?
[17:09:35] <tokam> but var editKeywordForm = $('#editkeywords').first( '.stn-form' );
[17:09:42] <tokam> this does not return my form too :(
[17:09:51] <Eviltwin> tokam: What do you think .first does?
[17:10:05] <tokam> returning the first element which mateches the given identifier
[17:10:13] <jhgaylor> $('#editkeywords') will select ONE element.  You can't first it.
[17:10:14] <Eviltwin> From that first collection
[17:10:32] <Eviltwin> So it grabs everything with editkeywords
[17:10:37] <jrobey> you search for it then call first on the resulting colletion. you could say element[0] too
[17:10:41] <Eviltwin> Then the first thing from that collection that has class stn-form
[17:10:43] <tokam> I wanted sub elements from that one
[17:10:51] <Eviltwin> Then you need .find
[17:10:53] <tokam> even this
[17:10:53] <tokam> var editKeywordForm = $('#editkeywords').children( '.stn-form' ).first();
[17:10:57] <tokam> ok thanks :)
[17:10:59] <jhgaylor> anyone got an idea as to why http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/6/ doesnt work?
[17:11:06] <Eviltwin> .children() means immediate children
[17:11:12] <Eviltwin> .find() means any descendant
[17:11:20] <tokam> fnd worked brilliand
[17:11:40] <tokam> children should work here too so Eviltwin find returns a collection?
[17:11:56] <Eviltwin> tokam: For any function you have questions about
[17:11:59] <Eviltwin> First go here: http://api.jquery.com/
[17:12:00] <Eviltwin> Search
[17:12:02] <Eviltwin> And read that page
[17:12:12] <Eviltwin> Or type "?<function>" here
[17:12:15] <Eviltwin> Like "?find"
[17:12:15] <tokam> ty =)
[17:12:19] <Eviltwin> ?find
[17:12:20] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[17:12:21] <tokam> I help you with ZF questions.
[17:12:26] <coldhead> jhgaylor: what's all this i hear about you not going to the jquery summit?
[17:12:30] <Eviltwin> Tells you exactly what it does
[17:12:50] <jhgaylor> i think its gonna be too short notice to go live
[17:12:55] <jhgaylor> so i might pay for the vids
[17:13:07] <Eviltwin> How much are the vids?
[17:13:14] <coldhead> you should just go
[17:13:16] <jhgaylor> same as a ticket i think
[17:13:27] <coldhead> vids are for albanians
[17:13:45] <coldhead> in person you can get backrubs
[17:13:50] <coldhead> probably
[17:13:52] <jhgaylor> but id have to bother my boss after hours for it to get t done in time
[17:14:32] <coldhead> i am happy for you to do that
[17:14:42] <coldhead> it's a chance for your boss to show excellence in leadership
[17:15:44] <jhgaylor> haha.  I just texted him *crosses fingers*
[17:17:38] <coldhead> good luck jhgaylor !
[17:19:22] <jhgaylor> shit... if i go to this thing, in a month ill be the question answerer and not the questioner
[17:19:42] <coldhead> exactly
[17:20:05] <coldhead> but also jQuery events are the second funnest events in the gombuter world
[17:20:10] <jhgaylor> but for that month im gonna have so many questions it is stupid
[17:20:26] <jhgaylor> i cant even get a simple onClick to work :(
[17:20:31] <coldhead> pfft, no one minds
[17:21:06] <coldhead> the sweet spot with jquery is when you can guess/hope that something works in a particular way
[17:21:09] <coldhead> and you try it
[17:21:12] <coldhead> and it does work
[17:21:14] <coldhead> ?cc
[17:21:15] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[17:24:58] <abjorn> I killed my Logitech G15 keyboard with water last night ;-; im so sad
[17:25:46] <luite> kill it with water!
[17:31:49] <jhgaylor> what does this line do?
[17:31:50] <jhgaylor> foo.html($(items));
[17:32:04] <jhgaylor> if foo is a selector.
[17:34:48] <jhgaylor> and items is the set of all children of foo
[17:40:01] <Spadeski> sup errbody
[17:40:03] <Spadeski> lol
[17:41:39] <coldhead> jhgaylor: from the looks of it, foo is probably a cached jQuery object
[17:41:49] <coldhead> var foo = $('img')
[17:41:57] <coldhead> or something similar
[17:42:01] <jhgaylor> http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/6/
[17:42:15] <coldhead> its common to denote such variables with a $ to remind you they're jquery objects
[17:42:22] <coldhead> so var $foo would be more idiomatic
[17:42:28] <jhgaylor> that makes sense
[17:42:35] <coldhead> and $items is probably $('li') or something
[17:42:53] <coldhead> so you're setting the html of foo to whatever $items contains
[17:42:56] <jhgaylor> yeah
[17:43:15] <jhgaylor> thats what i thought... why would that cause the elements to disappear?
[17:44:37] <amid_hasan> hi. i am calling a web service which returns xml. i'm stuck trying to figure out how to "parse" the xml and put it into my page. i know how to do this with json, but with xml i'm totally stumped.
[17:44:41] <amid_hasan> help?!
[17:44:43] <coldhead> html() is probably expecting a string of html and not on a jquery object
[17:44:53] <coldhead> althogh the docs may quibble
[17:45:19] <jhgaylor> it works if i do it procedurally, but if i bind it to an onclick it breaks
[17:45:31] <coldhead> ?parsexml @ amid_hasan
[17:45:31] <bot-t> amid_hasan, jQuery.parseXML(data): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[17:45:56] <coldhead> jhgaylor: onsubmit="" is now your friend
[17:46:10] <coldhead> use ?submit
[17:46:10] <bot-t> .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[17:46:18] <coldhead> it's more idiomatic
[17:46:19] <amid_hasan> coldhead: how to I pull the data from the webservice (xml) into my xml variable?
[17:46:32] <coldhead> amid_hasan: get() or post() or ajax()
[17:46:37] <coldhead> ?ajax @ amid_hasan
[17:46:37] <bot-t> amid_hasan, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:46:40] <jhgaylor> the same way you would consume a json feed
[17:47:09] <amid_hasan> so first i would use .get on the url and pass data into parseXML?
[17:48:02] <coldhead> that's what i'd try
[17:48:09] <amid_hasan> coldhead: thank you!
[17:48:13] <coldhead> although i'd first read the docs for AJAX
[17:48:13] <yogurt_truck> mmm anyone using jquery.ui.autocomplete?
[17:48:24] <coldhead> and see if it can handle it automatically for you
[17:48:34] <kborchers> yogurt_truck: what's your question
[17:48:37] <coldhead> dataType: 'xml' might be a thing
[17:48:51] <appl3s> hello
[17:48:54] <jhgaylor> that works betterish
[17:49:04] <jhgaylor> it sorts it, displays that, then reverts
[17:49:25] <yogurt_truck> kborchers: you know how it does the ajax request sending a "term" query? is there a way to override that? can't seem to find it on the docs
[17:51:05] <kborchers> override how?
[17:51:32] <appl3s> can someone please give me some assistance on trying to get the title attr from a tag please? any ideas what i'm doing wrong here? http://pastebin.com/LdfVTBYz
[17:51:51] <coldhead> jhgaylor: link to the new version?
[17:51:56] <kborchers> yogurt_truck: you mean like send parameters other than term?
[17:52:18] <yogurt_truck> kborchers: change that variable name, and if possible modify the query string entirely
[17:52:37] <kborchers> yogurt_truck: the source option can be a function
[17:52:47] <kborchers> check out the jsonp example in the docs
[17:53:05] <kborchers> then you can format your ajax call any way you want
[17:53:33] <jhgaylor> http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/7/
[17:53:41] <amid_hasan> darn. its not pulling in the xml data
[17:53:45] <yogurt_truck> kborchers: awesome. thanks
[17:53:50] <kborchers> np
[17:56:35] <jhgaylor> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/7/  is the reset part of the fiddle functionality?
[17:57:51] <coldhead> ah, well spotted
[17:58:01] <coldhead> that's because it's actually submitting the form
[17:58:20] <coldhead> and jsfiddle doesn't know what to do with your data
[17:58:23] <coldhead> so it just reloads it
[17:59:00] <coldhead> if you return false from the submit handler it won't actually submit
[17:59:06] <jhgaylor> hm.  well, in my code, the elements end up being removed from the page
[17:59:14] <jhgaylor> using the same code as you see on the fiddle
[17:59:26] <jhgaylor> which i totally don't understand
[17:59:53] <coldhead> jhgaylor: http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/8/
[17:59:58] <coldhead> it retains them there
[18:00:02] <coldhead> so that's a weirdness
[18:00:10] <jhgaylor> i get to attend!! Woohoo
[18:01:20] <coldhead> good going, jhgaylor
[18:01:28] <coldhead> that should be beautiful
[18:01:28] <brianseeders> anyone know a good IM api?
[18:01:30] <blindMoe> with two linked sortable lists is it possbiel to make it so one of them cannot have items dropped onto it?  So dragging between lists can only go one way
[18:01:38] <brianseeders> like a web based API for sending IMs to different networks
[18:01:55] <Eviltwin> blindMoe: I think you're probably going to have to code some of that yourself
[18:02:05] <Eviltwin> Use draggable and sortable but don't explicitly link them
[18:02:08] <coldhead> jhgaylor: i would use each rather than html http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/9/
[18:02:17] <blindMoe> Eviltwin: yeah that is kind of what I was thinking
[18:02:35] <blindMoe> I think I could use the .remove callback for the one list and just .remove() the item on drop
[18:02:52] <Eviltwin> (Pretty sure that's what I suggested earlier)
[18:03:02] <Eviltwin> But I haven't worked with either of them enough to know their ins and outs
[18:03:11] <Eviltwin> So you'll have to do that
[18:03:18] <Eviltwin> We might be able to help you debug
[18:03:26] <Eviltwin> No promises
[18:03:40] <jhgaylor> does it not seem weird that it works proceedurally, but not with an onsubmit?
[18:04:09] <Eviltwin> jhgaylor: What does?
[18:04:47] <jhgaylor> the code segment coldhead has been looking at.  http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/7/  on my machine it just completely removes the elements
[18:04:53] <blindMoe> Eviltwin: using .remove on the event handler worked... it probably isn't the best approach but it seems to work well
[18:05:16] <Eviltwin> That same jsFiddle?
[18:05:18] <jhgaylor> it worked when aj wrote it outside of an onsubmit.  then it worked for me when i put it in my code, but oncei  tied it to that button it stopped working
[18:06:09] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/kE5q8/10/
[18:06:13] <Eviltwin> Don't actually have it submit
[18:07:02] <jhgaylor> tried that too
[18:07:08] <jhgaylor> ill try it again
[18:07:16] <jhgaylor> in a boss fight atm
[18:07:57] <Eviltwin> If your goal is to have it so that when the form submits, it waits, sorts, then submits
[18:08:04] <Eviltwin> You're going to need a little bit more magic
[18:19:16] <jhgaylor> okay, so what is happening is the page is refreshing after the search because i tied it to an onclick... so i tried returning false, but it still reloaded.  so i tied it to a link and it worked
[18:23:17] <jhgaylor> hell yeah.  Looking forward to a day off of work to learn jquery
[18:28:47] <jhgaylor> Is Deferreds as complex a topic as it appears to me?
[18:31:06] <Ox41> Alright
[18:31:14] <Ox41> I will give someone $10 to figure this stupid problem out.
[18:32:16] <devaholic> $50
[18:32:50] <Ox41> lol its a simple logic problem, nothing too hard :P
[18:33:09] <devaholic> $1 per minute
[18:33:36] <Ox41> up to 10 minutes :)
[18:34:15] <jhgaylor> just ask the problem
[18:35:00] <coldhead> gross, blood
[18:35:11] <Ox41> http://pastebin.com/W1RAf1Ak
[18:35:19] <Ox41> my function is just never returning a valid issuer
[18:35:30] <Ox41> actually, its never getting to console.log('attempting '+cardnumber);
[18:35:42] <coldhead> jhgaylor: i think they're complicated until you have a problem where you need to use them
[18:35:51] <coldhead> then it becomes entirely pracical
[18:35:55] <coldhead> practical*
[18:36:02] <jhgaylor> thats a hundred lines of ugly.  not worth my eyes popping out of my head
[18:36:14] <coldhead> and you go "oh right, i want to defer this until some other thing is done, easy"
[18:36:33] <Ox41> its like return_issuer is never getting out of the for loop
[18:36:39] <Ox41> Is that a plausible explanation?
[18:37:23] <Ox41> var foo = 'foo'; for(...){ foo = 'bar'; } alert(foo); <=== alerts 'foo' or 'bar' ?
[18:37:36] <coldhead> jhgaylor: also worth checking out blog posts and vids on deferreds by jaubourg (the author) and mr. rmurphey (the instigator)
[18:39:06] <coldhead> Ox41: http://jsfiddle.net/qTd7h/
[18:39:10] <coldhead> bar, definitely bar
[18:41:35] <afeijo> hi all
[18:42:20] <afeijo> I was wondering if jQuery has an timeout feature, so I can mimic an autocomplete. To run my code only if the user stop typing after 500 ms ?
[18:42:47] <afeijo> I'm using setTimeout, but something like $.timeout() would be nicer
[18:44:29] <Ox41> ok, better question
[18:45:32] <Ox41> for(var id=1; id < pursuant.creditcard.issuers.length; id++){
[18:45:56] <Ox41> if pursuant.creditcard.issuers is an array ie {"1" : {'foo':'bar'}...}
[18:46:02] <Ox41> what would cause that to just be skipped
[18:56:13] <shesek> afeijo, no. You can use Underscore.js's debounce()
[18:58:49] <afeijo> shesek, interesting... but that brings lots of other functions I wont use. What about this one http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[19:02:12] <shesek> afeijo, hmm, it requires more code and could create conflicts if multiple places uses the same timer name
[19:03:01] <shesek> underscore.js's debounce has no dependencies, you can just take that (https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js#L553)
[19:03:59] <afeijo> nice!
[19:04:25] <shesek> IMO, it creates much more readable code... his resize example would be written as $(window).resize(debounce(function() { .... }, 250))
[19:04:54] <shesek> BTW, you do know that jQuery-UI has an awesome autocomplete widget, right?
[19:06:37] <solidus-lake> aaaaaaaaaaa, jquery selectors are killing me, making a jsfiddle of the situation but.. should $(element).find("filter") only find elements that are children of the $(element) ?
[19:06:52] <solidus-lake> because for me its finding childern of the element and children of the siblings of the elements
[19:07:02] <solidus-lake> AND ITS DRIVING ME INSANE
[19:07:09] * solidus-lake runs to jsfidde
[19:07:35] <shesek> solidus-lake, it shouldn't, you're probably be doing something wrong
[19:07:50] <solidus-lake> shesek: yeah it doesnt do this anywhere else in my code but here it does
[19:07:51] <shesek> s/be//
[19:08:11] <shesek> try to reproduce it on jsfiddle, with as minimal code as possible
[19:09:51] <solidus-lake> shesek: do i need full html or can i just fill out the body / relevant section on jsfiddle
[19:09:55] <solidus-lake> ie do i need html tags and header etc
[19:10:41] <shesek> the HTML code goes inside a `<body>` element already, you don't need to add that yourself
[19:12:59] <afeijo> shesek, weird, that debounce does nothing, I just copy it and added the needed lines into my code
[19:13:19] <shesek> define "does nothing" ?
[19:14:11] <shesek> and show the relevant code, preferably on jsfiddle
[19:14:42] <afeijo> shesek, I'll try that jsfiddle, but I have it here http://pastebin.com/PehymE7N
[19:15:33] <shesek> oh, no, that's not the way it works
[19:15:56] <solidus-lake> shesek, how do you get console.log out of jsfidde?
[19:16:23] <afeijo> shesek, ouch
[19:16:29] <shesek> afeijo, debounce() returns a function that delegates to the function you pass it
[19:16:38] <shesek> <shesek> IMO, it creates much more readable code... his resize example would be written as $(window).resize(debounce(function() { .... }, 250))
[19:16:54] <shesek> you should pass the return value from debounce() directly as the event callback
[19:17:16] <shesek> solidus-lake, the same as any other webpage
[19:17:30] <afeijo> got it
[19:18:08] <solidus-lake> shesek: http://jsfiddle.net/tL2Z5/1/
[19:18:15] <solidus-lake> wait, i think i understand just by doing that copy though
[19:18:38] <solidus-lake> the this element i'm using is not one object but an array of objects so i need to use $(this[i]) as the basis for the second filter
[19:19:14] <solidus-lake> is that right or horribly wrong, it doesnt seem to be fixing the issue
[19:20:10] <solidus-lake> nope, according to .each() the code i have there should work
[19:20:15] <afeijo> shesek, thanks m8, it worked!
[19:20:25] <shesek> afeijo, you welcome
[19:20:30] <solidus-lake> however if you look in the console its iterating over every li.tag_for_filter for each li.post
[19:20:43] <solidus-lake> so its as if the .find on the post is finding everything in the parents siblings as well
[19:20:58] <solidus-lake> and i'm back to bieng stumped :\
[19:21:56] <shesek> let me see
[19:23:29] <shesek> I don't understand how you're expecting this to work
[19:23:45] <solidus-lake> shesek: it appears it has something to do with havign both a ul.tags_for_display and a ul.tags_for_filter
[19:23:54] <shesek> What you wrote there finds every .post element, than every .tag_for_filter inside of it
[19:24:03] <solidus-lake> shesek: yeah except it doesnt do that
[19:24:15] <solidus-lake> shesek: it appears to find every .tag_for_filter twice, do you see the double output?
[19:25:13] <shesek> http://jsfiddle.net/tL2Z5/4/
[19:25:37] <shesek> I'm getting one tag_for_filter element for each .post element
[19:26:52] <shesek> If I change the console.log to `console.log('post #'+i+':', $(this).text());`, I'm getting "post #0: meet | post #1: none | post #2: tag_test"
[19:29:10] <solidus-lake> hmm its working for me now as well.. the bug must be in something i didn't copy
[19:29:21] <solidus-lake> one sec, let me scrub through my version and see if i can narrow in on it further
[19:30:16] <yamahaalex37> can i just use jqueryui to style divs instead of using images or css
[19:30:21] <yamahaalex37> but not use jqueryui for any effects
[19:30:58] <shesek> that's why jsfiddle is so great - while trying to paste a minimal code to demonstrate the problem, you usually find the cause of it
[19:31:00] <Stereo> I have a $('input[type="checkbox"]').button(); that seems to apply twice to some checkboxes, and I have no idea why
[19:31:13] <shesek> Stereo, its probably executed twice?
[19:31:25] <Stereo> that'd be a reasonable guess, but no
[19:31:34] <Stereo> and it doesn't apply to *all* buttons
[19:31:43] <Stereo> http://streetlist.openstreetmap.lu/streetlist/commune/Luxembourg <- one example
[19:32:25] <shesek> yamahaalex37, I don't see how jquery-ui replaces images or css, but you can use it however you like...
[19:32:47] <Stereo> oh wait
[19:33:03] <Stereo> I think I get it
[19:33:09] <Stereo> ignore me :)
[19:33:18] <Stereo> thanks for the help :)
[19:33:21] <yamahaalex37> shesek, i mean to get nice divs like this, rounded edges, nice gradient:
[19:33:29] <shesek> I didn't help much... but sure :-)
[19:33:39] <yamahaalex37> well no need for link, you know what jquery looks like
[19:34:13] <shesek> next time, I would suggest something like $.fn.button = function() { $(this).data('button_count', ($(this).data('button_count')||0)+1); console.log('Called on',this,'for the',$(this).data('button_count'),'time'); }
[19:34:24] <shesek> (@ Stereo)
[19:34:40] <shesek> yamahaalex37, it still uses images and css... but yeah, sure
[19:34:51] <shesek> you can customize the parts of jquery-ui you need in the download page
[19:35:11] <yamahaalex37> shesek, the problem is when i disinclude this line, the style doesnt load
[19:35:11] <yamahaalex37> $("#accordion").accordion({ header: "h3" });
[19:35:15] <shesek> download a version of it that only has the features you need
[19:35:33] <yamahaalex37> well i want the styling of #accordian, but not to load all the js behind it
[19:35:38] <yamahaalex37> i dont need the actual accordion effect
[19:36:34] <shesek> yamahaalex37, look at the generated HTML (using Firebug / Chrome Developer Tools / whatever) and see what classes jQuery adds to make it look like that
[19:36:44] <shesek> and add them yourself, directly to the HTML
[19:37:27] <yamahaalex37> ok, so there is no way in the jquery "Build your Download" to keep the style but disinclude the effect?
[19:37:33] <yamahaalex37> and thank you
[19:37:48] <shesek> well, it does more than just adding classes (manipulates the DOM - adds some new elements) - just see what it does and replicate that
[19:38:05] <shesek> if you don't need any of the JavaScript, just include the CSS files and don't use the javascript file at all
[19:38:08] <tokam> 			keywordEdit.hide( 'slow' );
[19:38:08] <tokam> 			keywordEdit.remove();
[19:38:21] <tokam> how can I make jquery wait with removing till hide is done?
[19:38:28] <shesek> tokam, el.hide('slow', function(){$(this).remove();})
[19:38:35] <tokam> thanks
[19:38:38] <shesek> I started writing the answer before seeing the question :-)
[19:39:07] <shesek> god, the 'function
[19:39:17] <shesek> god, the 'function' keyword looks so ugly after getting used to CoffeeScript
[19:39:30] <Spadeski> anyone know the Dragtoshare plugin in here?
[19:39:41] <shesek> that would've been `el.hide 'slow', -> el.remove()` in coffeescript
[19:39:52] <solidus-lake> shaseek, damnit, its really not working on the site but its the exact same code
[19:39:54] <solidus-lake> GRRRRRRRR
[19:39:55] <tokam> the hide effect does not look good for me is there an other one?
[19:39:57] <ldexterldesign> sup guys. if i wanna toggle a btn label as well, what's the best way of amending this code?     $('.togglefinder a').click(function () {
[19:39:57] <ldexterldesign>         $('.finder').slideToggle();
[19:39:57] <ldexterldesign>     });
[19:39:58] <solidus-lake> i'm going to rip out juggulars soon
[19:40:03] <shesek> tokam, and use `keywordEdit` instead of $(this)
[19:40:14] <tokam> ok
[19:40:36] <shesek> tokam, there are tons of effects that can be used to hide an element, check out the jQuery-ui websites, under the demos area
[19:41:09] <shesek> ldexterldesign, please don't paste code in the channel, use a pastebin next time
[19:41:56] <ldexterldesign> shesek: sorry, only a small code snippet. thought i could get away with it
[19:42:12] <shesek> solidus-lake, add some breakpoints and inspect the value of `this` (the one you're calling .find tag_filter_something on)
[19:42:45] <shesek> ldexterldesign, you want to change the text of `.togglefinder a`?
[19:42:45] <tokam> is this wrong syntax? keywordMain.hide( 'scale', {}, 'slow', function(){ keywordMain.remove(); } );
[19:43:02] <ldexterldesign> shesek: yea
[19:43:13] <ldexterldesign> shesek: looking at this now: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2155453/jquery-toggle-text
[19:43:54] <shesek> $(this).text($(':finder').is(':visible') ? 'Text when the element is about to be hidden' : 'Text when the element is about to be shown')
[19:44:00] <shesek> before $('.finder').slideToggle();
[19:44:01] <tokam> I am asking because removing does not seem to work anymore but I used the reference to write it
[19:44:04] <tokam> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/hide#option-effect
[19:44:14] <shesek> (@ ldexterldesign ^)
[19:46:13] <shesek> tokam, works for me, see http://jsfiddle.net/yu3VR/
[19:46:16] <shesek> must be doing something else wrong
[19:46:35] <tokam> here i found a cool demo http://jqueryui.com/demos/hide/
[19:48:02] <ldexterldesign> shesek: you meant .finder, not :finder, but that works a treat - cheers bro
[19:48:06] <tokam> shesek: for me it does nothing expect repositioning the elements in an ugly way without effect
[19:48:39] <ldexterldesign> shesek: what's your twitter hook?
[19:48:45] <shesek> tokam, can you try and reproduce it on jsfiddle?
[19:48:56] <shesek> ldexterldesign, I'm not using twitter
[19:49:05] <ldexterldesign> shesek: http://twitter.com/#!/ldexterldesign
[19:49:07] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from ldexterldesign: My code has improved drastically since I started using foo, bar, baz all over the joint. No more worrying about variable names! #Pseudocode â˜… http://bit.ly/rEUEcj
[19:49:09] <tokam> very hard hold on a second
[19:49:43] <shesek> tokam, a link, than?
[19:49:54] <shesek> ldexterldesign, ?
[19:50:31] <tokam> there should be a firefox plugin from jsfiddle
[19:50:43] <tokam> to create them automatically
[19:51:33] <shesek> you can't create them automatically - the whole point of it is to reproduce the problem with a minimal code, to make it easier for people like me to spot the problem
[19:51:43] <shesek> its hard to dig into 1000's lines of code
[19:52:04] <imsky> abjorn: a komodo dragon?
[19:52:23] <tokam> http://jsfiddle.net/xuEnZ/
[19:52:39] <yamahaalex37> thanks shesek, sorry i went afk. disincluding the JS kills the css styling... maybe jqueryUI is not for my case
[19:52:54] <yamahaalex37> is there any css library like jqueryui without js
[19:52:55] <solidus-lake> holy shit
[19:53:02] <solidus-lake> how do you compare booleans and strings in javascript
[19:53:11] <solidus-lake> its "hello" === "hello" right?
[19:53:14] <solidus-lake> and then its if
[19:53:21] <shesek> yamahaalex37, try console.log($("#accordion").accordion({ header: "h3" }).html())
[19:53:28] <solidus-lake> var should_be_true = true; if(should_be_true == true)
[19:53:32] <solidus-lake> right?!?
[19:53:33] <shesek> yamahaalex37, than use that exact HTML in your page, without the javascript. It should look the same
[19:53:34] <tokam> let'S delete the post url thing
[19:54:15] <shesek> solidus-lake, yes, both should work
[19:54:27] <thursday> if i did say $.('#myid').html('blah');.. if no element eith id of myid exists. does this throw an error?
[19:54:39] <shesek> thursday, no, it doesn't
[19:54:45] <thursday> thanks.
[19:54:55] <shesek> well, it would, a syntax error, due to the extra '.' after the '$'
[19:55:01] <shesek> but not for not finding any element
[19:55:21] <shesek> solidus-lake, but it won't work if you're using a string/boolean objects (and not natives)
[19:55:26] <yamahaalex37> shesek, can i leave jquery inclusions commented?
[19:55:32] <tokam> lol i do not get it running on jsfiddle
[19:55:39] <shesek> yamahaalex37, why couldn't you ?
[19:56:02] <black_warlock> guys can i make a question ?
[19:56:19] <yamahaalex37> commenting the jquery inclusions kills the css
[19:56:27] <shesek> black_warlock, "â™¥ Just ask!"
[19:56:32] <shesek> yamahaalex37, link
[19:56:36] <shesek> it makes no sense
[19:56:39] <yamahaalex37> http://www.ecs.eternaware.com/
[19:56:56] <yamahaalex37> first second third should have accordion style
[19:57:17] <yamahaalex37> <div id="accordion"> isnt enough?
[19:57:33] <black_warlock> i have a page where inside a div has been loaded a div from another page using .load
[19:57:54] <tokam> do you know shesek why jsfiddle does not even call my function?
[19:57:56] <tokam> http://jsfiddle.net/xuEnZ/8/
[19:58:12] <shesek> yamahaalex37, <shesek> yamahaalex37, try console.log($("#accordion").accordion({ header: "h3" }).html()) <shesek> yamahaalex37, than use that exact HTML in your page, without the javascript. It should look the same
[19:58:47] <black_warlock> it works , ok , but if in the new loaded div i wanna set another jq function will not work . my question is why ?
[19:58:49] <yamahaalex37> oh, that console.log doesnt need to be inside <Script>?
[19:59:20] <shesek> yamahaalex37, it needs to be executed, either inside a <script> tag or from the console
[19:59:43] <tokam> shesek: keywordMain.hide( 'slow' );
[19:59:43] <tokam> 			keywordEdit.hide( 'slow' );
[19:59:44] <Spadeski> tokam fadeOut()
[19:59:47] <tokam> that wors good
[19:59:58] <tokam> but if i use the speified effect nothing happens
[20:00:09] <shesek> tokam, $('#editkeywords') - there's no such element in your HTML
[20:00:21] <solidus-lake> holy crap, i found my problem but i'm no where near closer to solving it...
[20:00:23] <yamahaalex37> shesek, i was using console log, inside <script>, inside <head>, and same accordion HTML
[20:00:30] <shesek> tokam, maybe the effect is not included in your jQuery-UI version?
[20:00:39] <solidus-lake> i'm using railsAutocomplete.jquery event but the input field is blank
[20:00:42] <solidus-lake> its blank when it gets called
[20:00:46] <solidus-lake> super blank
[20:00:59] <solidus-lake> i want to kill someone
[20:01:03] <yamahaalex37> i think i need to include jquery?
[20:01:09] <solidus-lake> i'm going to sign out of irc before i go apeshit, this is the 5th day of this bug
[20:01:25] <shesek> yamahaalex37, I meant for you to do that in your page
[20:01:43] <yamahaalex37> but i did, did you check the page?
[20:01:52] <yamahaalex37> oh in body?
[20:02:05] <tokam> shesek: 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js'
[20:02:07] <tokam> this is what i use
[20:02:30] <shesek> tokam, those effects are part of jQuery-UI, not jQuery's core
[20:02:41] <tokam> thank you
[20:02:57] <shesek> yamahaalex37, okay, great - now take the HTML code that's outputted to the console, and use that in your page
[20:03:43] <tokam> shesek: do I need an api key? http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jqueryUI
[20:03:52] <shesek> tokam, no
[20:04:00] <shesek> hold on
[20:04:08] <tokam> i search the url from an cdn
[20:04:11] <yamahaalex37> shesek, im not quite sure i understand, but i appreciate your help, and you are helping a lot of people, im sure ill get it
[20:04:14] <abjorn> imsky
[20:04:15] <abjorn> nah
[20:04:18] <abjorn> a dragon dragon
[20:04:22] <abjorn> punched it in its face
[20:04:23] <imsky> wut
[20:04:25] <yamahaalex37> it would be cool if there was like a cssqueryUI =D
[20:04:26] <abjorn> skyrim
[20:04:27] <abjorn> brah
[20:04:33] <imsky> oh yeah my friend got that shit
[20:04:38] <imsky> i looked at it on steam
[20:04:44] <imsky> looked...ok i guess
[20:04:53] <imsky> how you like it bro
[20:04:57] <shesek> tokam, http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.5/jquery-ui.min.js
[20:05:04] <abjorn> its good
[20:05:05] <tokam> wow thx
[20:05:09] <abjorn> i usually dont like bethesda games
[20:05:13] <abjorn> but this one i really like
[20:05:14] <abjorn> good game
[20:05:22] <shesek> tokam, just switch to the latest version
[20:05:22] <imsky> word up, punch the shit out of that dragoon
[20:05:59] <shesek> tokam, that is, http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/jquery-ui.min.js
[20:07:15] <shesek> yamahaalex37, the way jQuery widgets works, when you call $("#accordion").accordion() it modifies the #accordion element by adding CSS classes and some DOM elements
[20:07:30] <tokam> did that now, and jquery core 1.7 but the highlight effect still does not seem to be there
[20:07:50] <tokam> but fold works now
[20:07:51] <abjorn> imsky: its kind of retarded, though, dragons aren't that hard lol
[20:07:54] <shesek> instead of using JavaScript to modify it, you can see how it get modified, take the generated HTML And use that directly
[20:07:56] <abjorn> but frost trolls are
[20:08:02] <imsky> lol
[20:08:19] <yamahaalex37> shesek, so its styled alot in the JS and difficult to seperate? or is it simple and i just need to figure it out?
[20:08:43] <shesek> you just need to look at the generated HTML and use that in your page
[20:08:45] <coldhead> hey abjorn your keyboard emailed me to tell me you suck
[20:08:50] <shesek> yamahaalex37, which is what calling console.log($("#accordion").accordion({ header: "h3" }).html() does - it shows you the generated HTML
[20:09:10] <tokam> gut it working now by writing it "highlight"
[20:09:16] <yamahaalex37> oh yeah i think i get it
[20:09:17] <shesek> tokam, does your code works on jsfiddle ?
[20:09:43] <yamahaalex37> so apply the css with jquery included, inspect the page, steal the css code, then disinclude jquery?
[20:10:17] <shesek> yamahaalex37, steal the *html* code, but yes
[20:12:00] <yamahaalex37> I apprecaite your kindness shesek
[20:13:00] <shesek> yamahaalex37, for example, if you have `<a id="foo">bar</a>`, and than you call `$('#foo').button()`, what you get is `<a id="foo" class="ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all ui-button-text-only" role="button"><span class="ui-button-text">bar</span></a>`
[20:13:25] <shesek> if you take that HTML code and put that in your HTML, it'll get the styling of a button, just as-if you called .button() on it
[20:13:27] <shesek> and you welcome
[20:14:39] <yamahaalex37> yeah, all the secrets reavealed =D
[20:14:46] <yamahaalex37> but i can apply it in my css right, not html?
[20:15:54] <shesek> well, you could, but its a bit tricky - as you see, it takes a combination of multiple classes to make it look like a button
[20:16:16] <shesek> if you want to do that from your own CSS, you'd have to combine all that CSS together
[20:17:30] <yamahaalex37> i dont understand
[20:17:34] <yamahaalex37> class="ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all ui-button-text-only"
[20:18:03] <yamahaalex37> .ui-button.ui-widget.uistate-default.ui...etc{style} ?
[20:19:18] <shesek> jQuery-UI's CSS has different styling applied to .ui-button, .ui-widget, .ui-corner-all, etc. Combining all of that together makes it look like a button
[20:19:37] <shesek> for example, every element with rounded corner has an the `ui-corner-all` class
[20:19:58] <shesek> if you'll remove that, you'll get a non-rounded borders button
[20:20:27] <shesek> why don't you want to simply use the HTML tho ?
[20:20:54] * shesek is going to make some coffee; brb
[20:21:07] <yamahaalex37> right, but isnt that one html line = one css line ui-button.ui-widget.ui-state-default.ui-corner-all.ui-button-text-only{ }
[20:21:34] <yamahaalex37> or i think im confused, and it would take many css lines, and html would just be a lot easier
[20:23:11] <shesek> no, each of those classes have separate CSS styling
[20:23:36] <shesek> so it can be reused - every widget that has rounded corners re-uses the ui-corner-all class
[20:23:52] <shesek> so you won't have to write the CSS code for rounded corners multiple times
[20:24:06] <yamahaalex37> damn... why cant i just grab that cs
[20:24:19] <shesek> (or, more correctly, so that jQuery-UI authors won't have to write that CSS code multiple times)
[20:24:23] <yamahaalex37> i guess because the js is dynamically applying class names to things
[20:24:37] <shesek> I don't understand what's the problem; what are you trying to do?
[20:24:43] <shesek> Why can't you just use that HTML ?
[20:25:34] <yamahaalex37> i want to learn to make joomla extensions
[20:25:41] <yamahaalex37> that use jquery
[20:25:57] <yamahaalex37> i just wanst sure if implementing the style in css or html was proper
[20:26:05] <yamahaalex37> thought css might be better for style
[20:26:50] <yamahaalex37> because if someone adds a new element, i would have to code the html for it, the css wouldnt just automatically apply
[20:27:40] <black_warlock> how can i let the div content appear inside another div
[20:27:45] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/28vJn/14/
[20:27:46] <shesek> well, the HTML is just a bunch of CSS classes
[20:27:56] <shesek> and sometimes an extra DOM element to overcome some CSS limitations
[20:28:17] <yamahaalex37> so say i have module1 and i apply the class in the .php. then someone creates instance 2 of module1, i would have to edit the .php, instead of the css just applying to it
[20:28:28] <tokam> shesek: not on jsfiddle but on my def server
[20:28:57] <yamahaalex37> or, more likely, i am not understanding the concept, and need to practice, either way ill try to stop asking questions
[20:29:13] <shesek> yamahaalex37, why? asking questions is a great way to learn
[20:30:29] <shesek> yamahaalex37, the actual appearance settings are still in the CSS. If you want to change the appearance, you'll still be editing the CSS
[20:30:30] <coldhead> why is a raven like a writing desk?
[20:30:54] <shesek> The HTML simply tells the browser what classes it should apply to that element
[20:31:39] <yamahaalex37> well i guess if i wanted to write a joomla slider module for instance,
[20:31:52] <yamahaalex37> i would still want to style it in the php? with html
[20:32:04] <black_warlock> nothing ok gnight =)
[20:32:27] <yamahaalex37> and no matter how many instances of the module exist, they will all be styled correct?
[20:33:02] <shesek> you would style in the CSS, and use HTML to tell the browser to apply that styling on the element
[20:33:50] <yamahaalex37> but i want to use Jquery
[20:33:51] <tokam> shesek: i would like to create an element by markup and use the show effect to display it.
[20:33:54] <yamahaalex37> JqueryUI's styling
[20:33:57] <tokam> what is the best function to use to do it?
[20:34:20] <tokam> must I create it first hidden?
[20:34:34] <shesek> $('<div>.....').hide().appendTo('#somewhere').fadeIn()
[20:35:01] <tokam> thanks :)
[20:35:05] <shesek> sure
[20:35:38] <shesek> yamahaalex37, well, yes, I meant in general that the actual styling comes from the CSS, not that *you* would have to write that CSS
[20:37:51] <yamahaalex37> right, so if i was making a joomla module, i could just use jqueryUI in php, not use css (for gradients, round borders), and regardless how many same module exist, will work
[20:38:33] <tokam> shesek: I used ur code which worked good and i altered it .show().effect('highlight')
[20:38:41] <tokam> but now it does not work no more. i found that on stackoverflow
[20:38:52] <tokam> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3311965/jquery-how-to-show-an-element-and-use-the-highlight-effect-at-the-same-time
[20:39:18] <shesek> IIRC you can .show('highlight')
[20:39:41] <shesek> (I'm not sure if jQuery-UI allows to use highlight as a show effect, but give it a try)
[20:39:54] <shesek> but that code should work too
[20:40:18] <tokam> show highlight works but i need it slow
[20:40:37] <tokam> 'slow', 'highlight'
[20:42:29] <tokam> .show( 'slow').effect( 'highlight' ); shows it but without the highlight effect
[20:44:20] <tokam> I would like to have that effect http://jsfiddle.net/r6pKn/
[20:44:30] <tokam> but if I addapt that I do not get it displayed at all
[20:44:35] <tokam> $( data.keywordEdit ).appendTo( $( '#edit_keywordlist' ) ).show().effect( 'highlight' );
[20:44:48] <tokam> if I write fadeIn or show('slow') i get it displayed but without the effect
[20:44:55] <tokam> ui is imported.
[20:46:03] <OomElvis> is there something in the jquery UI that is like a tooltip?
[20:46:15] <coldhead> lol impotence
[20:46:21] <OomElvis> you hover over a link , and you see a sort of speech bubble thing with the info
[20:46:22] <coldhead> oh sorry i thought that said something else
[20:46:29] <OomElvis> / tooltip  / whatever?
[20:46:41] <coldhead> i really like tipTip, OomElvis
[20:46:45] <coldhead> but that's not in UI
[20:47:00] <OomElvis> there's also http://jquery.bassistance.de/tooltip/demo/
[20:47:34] <shesek> tokam, I don't think you can do that. Can't you show it slowly and do the highlight effect after its shown ?
[20:47:54] <tokam> i will try that
[20:47:54] <OomElvis> thanks, coldhead
[20:48:16] <shesek> OomElvis, I personally like qTip
[20:48:24] <shesek> (http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/)
[20:48:58] <coldhead> OomElvis: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2010/05/jquery-ui-19m1-tooltip/
[20:49:03] <coldhead> looks like UI can help you after all
[20:49:43] <tokam> shesek: .show( 'slow' ).effect( 'highlight', {}, 3000 );
[20:49:51] <tokam> it takes some time and than it just appears.
[20:49:56] <tokam> without highlight.
[20:50:22] <OomElvis> shesek: looks good
[20:50:44] <shesek> if you want it to show slowly and do the highlight effect after its fully shown, .show('slow', function() { $(this).effect('highlight', 3000); })
[20:52:02] <shesek> OomElvis, do note that its pretty advanced and has lots of options, if you don't need all that there are many lightweighter libraries out there
[20:52:21] <coldhead> like tiptip!
[20:52:48] <OomElvis> lol
[20:53:48] <tokam> shesek: highlight is still not shown
[20:53:54] <tokam> like in the jsfiddle paste
[20:54:04] <tokam> which was linked on stackoverflow
[20:54:19] <donagi> ok quick question i have made a slide down panel once you click on a link on my page that pulls that page down how can i make it load that page into the part that slides dpown
[20:55:55] <shesek> tokam, http://jsfiddle.net/VWQmA/
[20:55:58] <shesek> works for me
[20:56:00] <coldhead> that highlight effect is gross anyway
[20:57:47] <tokam> maybe the issue is again my environment
[20:57:58] <tokam> copy pasted your code and i get the same issues
[20:58:32] <Stereo> how are you supposed to encode json with php for jquery to be able to do something with it?
[20:58:47] <Stereo> right now I'm getting something like "{\"missing\":\"<tr class=\\\"stripeMe\\\" id=\\\"cadastrow3\\\">\ etc.
[20:59:08] <Stereo> and jquery just goes, I don't want that stuff
[20:59:16] <coldhead> Stereo: jquery will be happy if the output is validated by jsonlint.com
[20:59:22] <Stereo> aha
[20:59:51] <coldhead> so keep scrubbing and pasting your output in there until its good
[21:00:10] <coldhead> it will bitch until you fix it :)
[21:00:41] <Stereo> heh
[21:01:09] <abjorn> imsky: so my poor Logitech G15 died today, because I spilled water on it :(
[21:01:19] <Stereo> I don't know why php puts quotes around the stuff
[21:01:31] <abjorn> I had to go buy some cheap (but decent) Razer keyboard
[21:01:32] <shesek> coldhead, looks like its been encoded twice
[21:01:41] <abjorn> I miss my sweet, poor G15
[21:04:22] <Stereo> ok, lessons learned, don't call json_encode() on the same stuff twice :)
[21:04:56] <Stereo> in fact that's one lesson
[21:05:03] <Stereo> thank you coldhead
[21:05:13] <imsky> abjorn: oh lawd
[21:05:45] <Spadeski> anyone know how to make the thing on the right like when im up in my list it stays and when i cscroll it follwows
[21:05:47] <Spadeski> http://www.webdesignshock.com/jquery-slider
[21:05:55] <imsky> abjorn: damn that's like a hundred bucks
[21:07:21] <abjorn> well, $80, but yeah
[21:07:26] <abjorn> for this keyboard anyways
[21:07:28] <abjorn> for the new one
[21:07:30] <abjorn> that's "cheap"
[21:07:44] <abjorn> my G15 I got super cheap on sale for $50
[21:07:45] <abjorn> instead of
[21:07:46] <abjorn> like
[21:07:47] <abjorn> $150
[21:12:29] <abjorn> imsky: the more i play around with impact and read the docs, the more i like it
[21:12:33] <abjorn> although i think animations could be better
[21:12:37] <abjorn> might make my own implementation
[21:12:50] <abjorn> collisions are done really well though
[21:13:03] <imsky> word up, is that the same one from that other night
[21:13:07] <abjorn> yeah
[21:13:27] <abjorn> I wrote an (untested) A* search plugin too c:
[21:13:33] <imsky> what a pimp
[21:13:36] <abjorn> I'm really curious to try making a behavior tree plugin
[21:13:42] <abjorn> behavior trees are so fun to implement
[21:13:53] <abjorn> like, you think you know shit about recursion
[21:13:54] <abjorn> you dont
[21:14:00] <abjorn> until you do something like that
[21:14:15] <abjorn> in a language without proper first-class functions
[21:14:19] <imsky> sounds like a blog post waiting to happen
[21:14:25] <abjorn> lol nah
[21:15:03] <abjorn> I did behavior trees in a language that was basically a stolen/modified version of torque script, which like faked having proper lambda functions, but not really
[21:15:07] <abjorn> and the scope was really retarded with it
[21:15:09] <abjorn> it was
[21:15:11] <abjorn> so difficult lol
[21:15:14] <abjorn> but fun
[21:15:16] <abjorn> and rewarding
[21:15:16] <imsky> 0_o
[21:15:30] <abjorn> no really it had like the dumbest scoping rules you'd ever heard of
[21:15:43] <abjorn> no one REALLY knew how it worked tbh
[21:16:04] <abjorn> the guy making it really didn't, probably cause it was hacked on top of a shitty hack of torquescript
[21:16:21] <abjorn> BUT I MADE IT WORK
[21:16:25] * abjorn flexes
[21:16:30] * imsky woggles
[21:16:37] * abjorn wiggleflexes
[21:16:41] <coldhead> YOU'RE A TURING MACHINE, ABJORN
[21:16:47] <imsky> a turning machine
[21:16:56] <coldhead> seriously there is something awesomely wrong with you two
[21:16:58] <coldhead> <33
[21:17:14] <abjorn> rofl
[21:17:24] <abjorn> we're endearing
[21:17:39] <imsky> wut
[21:17:43] <abjorn> i dont know
[21:18:05] <abjorn> NOOOO
[21:18:11] <abjorn> there's a scratch on my nice new desk ;-;
[21:18:15] <imsky> lol
[21:18:29] * abjorn all is lost
[21:18:33] <imsky> what the hell is going on at your place
[21:18:47] <imsky> keyboard gets fucked up, desk gets scratched
[21:18:54] <imsky> sounds like you got a saboteur in your house
[21:19:16] <abjorn> i do
[21:19:17] <abjorn> its me
[21:19:19] <abjorn> :(
[21:19:26] <imsky> u r ur own worst emeny
[21:20:58] <abjorn> i really am, imsky, i really am
[21:21:22] <imsky> well i'm off for the night
[21:21:30] <imsky> don't get electrocuted or something
[21:21:48] <amirite> anyone know how to prevent mobile browsers from resizing text blocks on zoom in?
[21:22:07] <imsky> abjorn: l8r br0
[21:47:05] <Spadeski> where do i go to look for people who wanna get in on non-profit projects?
[21:47:36] <Eviltwin> Spadeski: SourceForge
[21:49:27] <clear-in> hi evil twin!
[21:51:01] <Eviltwin> clear-in: Hi
[22:06:12] <JoeyA> $('<option>').attr('value', item.value).text(item.label);  This works, but would it be better to say $('<option></option>') ?
[22:06:55] <JoeyA> Or does jQuery tolerate the unclosed tag just fine?
[22:07:45] <JoeyA> Saying $('<option>') is very intuitive; it looks like a constructor for a node of type <option>.
[22:13:50] <thomedy> okay im using window.location.href and im getting a missing ; error in firebug
[22:14:21] <thomedy> i think its becuase im using a path rather than a file but i havent been able to find an fix
[22:16:44] <Eviltwin> JoeyA: jQuery doesn't care
[22:16:56] <JoeyA> Thanks
[22:17:03] <Eviltwin> JoeyA: $("<option></option>") is the most explicit and most correct
[22:17:16] <Eviltwin> $("<option/>") is still explicit but not quite correct
[22:17:28] <Eviltwin> $("<option>") is implicit and totally wrong but jQuery's cool with it
[22:17:29] <Eviltwin> It's used to it
[22:17:32] <JoeyA> thomedy: If you use backslashes in a JavaScript string, you have to escape them
[22:17:54] <JoeyA> thomedy: e.g. "C:\\Documents and Settings\\Owner\\"
[22:18:04] <coldhead> gross
[22:18:17] <thomedy> okay... let me think of how to apply it because im new to this technique
[22:18:21] <thomedy> it seems easier the ajax
[22:18:24] <thomedy> so im trying it
[22:18:37] <Eviltwin> Solution: Don't use fucking Windows paths
[22:18:45] * JoeyA agrees
[22:19:13] <JoeyA> Saying "C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\" will likely cause a syntax error because the string isn't terminated.
[22:19:17] <coldhead> or PHP namespace separators
[22:19:19] <JoeyA> (the end quote is escaped)
[22:19:28] <thomedy> okay... hers the situation im in linux but that shouldn't be a prob
[22:19:56] <thomedy> but im using drupal so when i get location.href i get yoursite.com/?q=name
[22:19:59] <Eviltwin> I think DOS was just trying to distinguish itself from Unix when they chose backslashes
[22:20:10] <thomedy> i know people hate drupal... but it pays well
[22:20:12] <Eviltwin> To try to hide the fact that it was a blatant rip off
[22:20:15] <Eviltwin> And a bad one at that
[22:20:27] <thomedy> and im okay with people hatting on it
[22:20:38] <Eviltwin> thomedy: What's wrong with that location.href?
[22:20:51] <thomedy> i can grab it fine as an alert by it self
[22:21:08] <thomedy> but when i use it to pass a variable to php i run into a missing ; error
[22:21:21] <sgronblo> Is there no callback for errors for jsonp requests?
[22:21:37] <thomedy> my code though it may be grossly wrong is
[22:21:49] <Eviltwin> sgronblo: It's a little weird
[22:21:56] <thomedy> windows.location.href?name=windows.location.href
[22:22:06] <thomedy> im writing a click recorder
[22:22:12] <Eviltwin> sgronblo: If a fetch for JavaScript yields a 403 or 404 or something, it doesn't actually run
[22:22:28] <sgronblo> Eviltwin: yeah but cant jquery detect that somehow?
[22:22:48] <sgronblo> kill the script after some timeout or something and call error
[22:22:52] <Eviltwin> sgronblo: Not always and not in all browsers
[22:23:04] <Eviltwin> Why not set your own timer?
[22:23:33] <sgronblo> Eviltwin: I thought there'd be some cleverer way of doing it in jquery already
[22:24:07] <Eviltwin> ?$.ajax
[22:24:08] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Ajax - The jQuery library has a full suite of AJAX capabilities. The functions and methods therein allow us to load data from the server without a browser page refresh. http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[22:24:17] <Eviltwin> Look at the timeout property
[22:24:29] <Eviltwin> It'll hit error with the message "timeout"
[22:24:49] <thomedy> join drupal
[22:25:18] <thomedy> sorry not what i meant to write
[22:25:24] <sgronblo> "In Firefox 3.0+ only, script and JSONP requests cannot be cancelled by a timeout; the script will run even if it arrives after the timeout period" X_X
[22:26:36] <Eviltwin> sgronblo: You know JSONP is pretty much a total hack, right?
[22:26:54] <Eviltwin> If you have control over the callback name, you can ignore it
[22:27:28] <Eviltwin> But you are quite literally loading (potentially arbitrary) code into the browser and running it
[22:27:45] <Eviltwin> No safety checks
[22:27:47] <Eviltwin> Nothing like that
[22:27:51] <sgronblo> I know
[22:28:45] <sgronblo> So you're saying that the statusText in the error callback will be timeout?
[22:30:54] <sgronblo> thanks for the help though
[22:31:08] <sgronblo> I at least can show some notification this way
[22:31:48] <clear-in> eviltwin have you tried to use the full-calendar?
[22:31:53] <Eviltwin> No
[22:36:28] <amid_hasan> Still having issues pulling any data from an xml webservices using jquery. Can anybody help me?
[22:36:51] <amid_hasan> tried $.get and also .parseXML. I think I'm doing something terribly wrong
[22:37:55] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[22:38:23] <amid_hasan> hi
[22:38:28] <silv3r_m00n> I have some css in a string like this "color:#fff; background:#ccc;" now I need to apply it on a certain element , how can I do that?
[22:39:17] <amid_hasan> $('#element').addCss('classname');
[22:39:25] <silv3r_m00n> no , I don't have a class
[22:39:26] <thomedy> http://pasteall.org/pic/20842
[22:39:40] <silv3r_m00n> I have some css , say inputted by a user and I have it in a variable var a = "";
[22:39:58] <amid_hasan> you can set attribute
[22:39:59] <thomedy> okay while you look at that.. if you clikc on the right image the site looks one way with a bit different of options... if you clik onthe lifet image the same
[22:40:18] <silv3r_m00n> not even setting the attribute , I need to use the string as it is
[22:40:22] <amid_hasan> $('#element').attr('style','color:#fff; background:#ccc;');
[22:40:24] <thomedy> and if you toggle back and forth in the site then you have that
[22:40:40] <thomedy> but only on the /plans or /regrets
[22:40:47] <silv3r_m00n> amid_hasan: hmm ok thanks
[22:40:50] <thomedy> which i the front page of the internal versions
[22:41:07] <amid_hasan> http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[22:42:37] <silv3r_m00n> amid_hasan: and by the way , how to apply for pseudo selectors like :hover , :active ?
[22:43:36] <amid_hasan> you apply sudo selectors to any class or element same way you would in css. The trick here is it's common to add a class to specify if element is active or not.
[22:43:44] <amid_hasan> because there's a jQuery function for hover
[22:44:48] <amid_hasan> i.e. $('#element').addClass('active'); if $('#element').hasClass('active'){ doSomething();}else{ $('#element').addClass('active');}
[22:45:09] <amid_hasan> silv3r_m00n: i think something like that
[22:46:26] <silv3r_m00n> hmm ok
[22:49:17] <amid_hasan> does anyone know how i can get output from a public xml feed into my page using jquery? trying to get parse use this http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=routeConfig&a=sf-muni&r=N
[22:50:23] <kategeek> amid_hasan: is there a json version?
[22:55:11] <kategeek> amid_hasan: you can't request xml from an external domain. look into same origin policy. You could build a proxy (back-end)
[22:58:37] <amid_hasan> kategeek: how do people use the above mentioned api then?
[22:58:44] <amid_hasan> I'm totally confused now
[22:59:24] <coldhead> try to stay calm
[22:59:28] <coldhead> it's going to be okay
[22:59:33] <coldhead> i've called your parents
[23:00:01] <kategeek> they use server side code that has no same origin restrictions
[23:00:54] <kategeek> then serve it up from their domain
[23:01:41] <amid_hasan> How would you use javascript w/o any sort of server configuration to access the public xml feed?
[23:02:31] <kategeek> you could configure your browser to ignore same origin policy, but it wouldn't work for your friends
[23:03:25] <amid_hasan> if its same origin policy that means i would be restricted from accessing the xml feed if i wasn't on their domain...
[23:03:30] <amid_hasan> still confused
[23:06:00] <shesek> amid_hasan, take a look at YQL
[23:06:40] <shesek> its a Yahoo service that does a lot of cool stuff, you can use it over JSONP and read data from 3rd party domains
[23:07:33] <silv3r_m00n> I am making a user enter some css in a textarea , and I need to apply it to the hover of some html element , how ?
[23:09:00] <shesek> silv3r_m00n, $('<style>').text('foo:hover {' + user_input + '}').appendTo('head')
[23:09:23] <sean`> hi all
[23:09:31] <shesek> silv3r_m00n, could be (ab)used to execute JavaScript code, so be careful
[23:09:39] <silv3r_m00n> shesek: any other alternative ?
[23:10:15] <Eviltwin> silv3r_m00n: How could it be abused?
[23:10:53] <amid_hasan> shesek: my issue is HOW to implement. a code sample would really help
[23:11:10] <silv3r_m00n> shesek: it will create a new style element everytime user edits , what if I need to update and existing one
[23:11:19] <amid_hasan> i.e. let's say I wanted to pull in horoscopes from yahoo horoscopes
[23:11:36] <coldhead> let me guess, it's for a friend?
[23:11:36] <shesek> var user_style = $('<style>').appendTo('head'); user_style.text('foo:hover {' + user_input + '}') ?
[23:12:02] <coldhead> that would be awesome if that worked shesek
[23:12:12] <shesek> coldhead, it should work
[23:12:20] <Eviltwin> shesek: How can it be abused to execute JavaScript?
[23:12:34] <shesek> amid_hasan, either look for a service that exposes JSONP, setup a server-side proxy for fetching it or read up on YQL
[23:12:43] <silv3r_m00n> shesek: it works , but how to update or modify ?
[23:12:53] <silv3r_m00n> the user keeps typing or editing and I need to update as well
[23:13:10] <shesek> Eviltwin, some CSS expression allows executing JavaScript under some browsers. Try a{color:expression(alert())} on IE (<9 IIRC)
[23:13:23] <shesek> silv3r_m00n, <shesek> var user_style = $('<style>').appendTo('head'); user_style.text('foo:hover {' + user_input + '}') ?
[23:13:35] <shesek> just use text() to update the <style> element
[23:13:58] <silv3r_m00n> hmm yes , thanks
[23:14:22] <shesek> Eviltwin, you also have -moz-binding under FF
[23:14:35] <shesek> and foo: url(javascript:...) on some browsers, don't remember which
[23:15:56] <shesek> Eviltwin, and, IIRC, @import 'javascript:...', under some browsers
[23:16:16] <nospinzy> anyone go thru techcrunch start up section and ask yourself how do half these guys get funding for their pretentious projects?
[23:16:32] <cgiGeek> hi there
[23:16:55] <nospinzy> these people get millions in venture capital
[23:16:57] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/kueF3/
[23:17:19] <cgiGeek> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ there is a post to div sample there, it dont work even if I copy it literally, any ideas ?
[23:18:19] <Eviltwin> Looks fine to me
[23:18:34] <cgiGeek> http://www.fluxcentral.org/test.html dont do nothing
[23:18:44] <cgiGeek> yes syntax is ok
[23:18:56] <Eviltwin> Replaces the contents of div with id "result" with the contents of div with the id "content" in the data coming down
[23:19:01] <cgiGeek> looks fine but dont even post
[23:19:33] <Eviltwin> It definitely posts
[23:19:47] <cgiGeek> hmm let me open my error console
[23:19:49] <Eviltwin> It just does it with AJAX in the background
[23:19:54] <Eviltwin> I see it right here, dude
[23:20:02] <Eviltwin> You're getting a 404 because the page you've told it to look for doesn't exist
[23:20:09] <cgiGeek> u r right
[23:20:17] <Eviltwin> Make a page that has a div with id of "content" somewhere in it
[23:20:20] <Eviltwin> Point the form at that
[23:20:22] <Eviltwin> Try again
[23:20:51] <cgiGeek> thank you
[23:28:50] <amid_hasan> nospinzy: they suck dick to get the funding. its an open secret.
[23:29:25] <cgiGeek> they know people
[23:29:43] <cgiGeek> like any other venture
[23:29:47] <cgiGeek> :(
[23:36:16] <cgiGeek> http://www.fluxcentral.org/layout.html works content div and js and form on the same main div
[23:36:16] <cgiGeek> http://www.fluxcentral.org/layout1.html doesn't content div and js on same main div, but form on different div
[23:36:50] <cgiGeek> I am guessing I have to add a div  to the js submit function event
[23:36:53] <donCams> congrats http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home
[23:37:11] <donCams> -slowpoke-
[23:38:30] <Eviltwin> cgiGeek: Sorry, you're going to have to play with this one yourself or have someone else help you
[23:38:36] <Eviltwin> You sound pretty new to jQuery
[23:38:44] <cgiGeek> you have helped me tons, thanks
[23:38:45] <Eviltwin> And maybe JavaScript in general
[23:38:53] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[23:39:03] <cgiGeek> js not to bad, jquery is my first week
[23:39:14] <cgiGeek> what gave me away, lol
[23:39:33] <Eviltwin> The fact that you've copy-pasted a specific example into your page
[23:39:41] <Eviltwin> Leads me to believe that you don't know how to build things for yourself
[23:40:00] <cgiGeek> u r correct
[23:40:12] <Eviltwin> Best of luck! :D
[23:40:14] <Eviltwin> G'night
[23:40:14] <cgiGeek> have to start somehwere tho :)

[23:48:46] <clear-in> ok tnx
[23:48:48] <clear-in> :)
[23:48:53] <wiseguy528> i am trying to use simple jquery .load function and the code worked on testing machine, but it doesn't work on production
[23:49:49] <donCams> wiseguy528, what exactly do you mean by not working? :3
[23:50:19] <wiseguy528> donCams, i don't see the loaded content
[23:50:52] <wiseguy528> i am using simple one line load command: $("#adv").load("http://digma.lt/banner.php");
[23:52:45] <donCams> maybe your production server cannot access that URL... anyway, wait a moment. i'm sure an expert may help you
[23:54:56] <donCams> btw, digma.lt/banner.php was down for me earlier (Philippines), now it's ok. have you tried it again wiseguy528?
[23:55:19] <wiseguy528> yes, i have tried it many times
[23:55:37] <donCams> care to give me the link to your production? :)
[23:55:38] <wiseguy528> i tried to access the site from production server
[23:55:43] <wiseguy528> ye
[23:55:53] <wiseguy528> http://www.atradau.lt
[23:56:09] <cgiGeek> thanks and have a good one, bye
[23:56:12] <wiseguy528> it should load the top advertisement
[23:57:45] <wiseguy528> ghme
[23:57:49] <wiseguy528> i found interesting
[23:57:50] <wiseguy528> Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the same origin policy; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain, subdomain, or protocol.
[23:58:13] <wiseguy528> maybe that's the problem
