[00:01:08] <marinade> this is where i got it from https://github.com/davatron5000/FitVids.js/issues/33
[00:01:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #33 on FitVids.js (jonathanmoore; 9m, 2w ago): iFrame Embed Swapping/Duplicating
[00:01:32] <marinade> Cork in the jsfiddle it doenst resize niether tho
[00:02:13] <Stava> Which is the preferred way to run a function when the document/web page is ready? Is it simply $(function() { /* ... */ }); or should I do something like $(window).ready(function() { /* ... */ });?
[00:05:08] <duderion> g'mornin
[00:05:57] <Cork> EnginA: ya, seams to be a bug in getScript, but ajax works
[00:06:28] <Angryasian> $(window).ready(function(){}) is depcreated but still works. $(function(){}); is equivalent to $(document).ready(function(){});
[00:06:37] <Angryasian> Stava --^
[00:06:50] <Cork> EnginA: http://jsfiddle.net/rb2ne/1/
[00:07:25] <Cork> Angryasian: where have you read that $(window) was depricated?
[00:08:09] <Stava> Angryasian: Thanks
[00:08:29] <Cork> or to be precise i don't thing $(window).ready was ever supported
[00:09:44] <Cork> marinade: http://jsfiddle.net/HbYtK/11/ resizes for me
[00:09:56] <Angryasian> I read it somewhere. They don't want people to use window.ready they want people to use .load and do stuff once their relevant image or whatever is loaded.
[00:09:59] <EnginA> Cork: I doN2t think it's a bug, it's a limitation of the method itself
[00:10:10] <Cork> EnginA: no
[00:10:27] <Cork> if you check the first example in that fiddle thats what getScript does
[00:10:28] <EnginA> how can you tell if a timeout occured for <script> ?
[00:10:40] <Cork> script.onerror
[00:10:49] <Cork> or addEventListener('error')
[00:11:03] <Cork> EnginA: if you check the fiddle i do it on a script tag
[00:11:13] <EnginA> i'll check now
[00:11:35] <Cork> EnginA: and the ajax call does it on a script tag too
[00:11:50] <Cork> so its a pure bug n getScript
[00:12:31] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { type: 'script' }) === $.getScript(url)
[00:12:37] <ajpiano> is the script on the same domain
[00:12:40] <marinade> Cork it doenst for me
[00:12:41] <marinade> ahahhh
[00:12:44] <marinade> LOL
[00:12:48] <Cork> ajpiano: no
[00:12:51] <ajpiano> yea
[00:12:58] <ajpiano> there is not an error handler fired for cross domain script requests
[00:13:11] <marinade> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fitVids'
[00:13:15] <Cork> ajpiano: it works on .ajax
[00:13:35] <Cork> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/rb2ne/1/
[00:13:45] <EnginA> Cork: looks like that statement evaluates to false
[00:14:00] <Angryasian> okay so .load() is deprecated as of the current api it seems. You guys confused me, its Document ready and window load.
[00:14:10] <Angryasian> window ready, I have no clue what it means or does.
[00:14:10] <Cork> EnginA: you don't get the error2 alert?
[00:14:35] <ajpiano> Cork:   Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests. This is an Ajax Event.
[00:14:42] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ under error
[00:15:23] <EnginA> Cork: I got it, and that's why getScript and ajax are not the same
[00:15:40] <Cork> then you're getting something i don't
[00:15:41] <EnginA> besides, I just did ajax(request, {type: 'script'}), it sent OPTIONS
[00:16:06] <EnginA> as in what happens when you use native xhr object to send cross domain requests
[00:16:17] <Cork> i don't get a native xhr
[00:16:23] <Cork> thats my point
[00:16:43] <Cork> sure it tries with to see if it can do ajax
[00:16:48] <Cork> detects that it can't
[00:17:01] <Cork> then use native script call
[00:17:12] <ajpiano> Cork: it's dataType: "script"
[00:17:20] <ajpiano> that's what tells it to use the script transport
[00:17:22] <ajpiano> which doesn't use an xhr
[00:17:23] <EnginA> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/rb2ne/2/
[00:17:44] <EnginA> i'm so angry right now! my beloved jq is fucked up
[00:19:15] <maasha> kst
[00:19:25] <maasha> is there a buildin slider in jQuery ala http://jqueryui.com/slider/#steps ?
[00:19:58] <ajpiano> there are no UI controls in jQuery core
[00:20:05] <Cork> EnginA: so do it your self then
[00:20:10] <maasha> ajpiano:
[00:20:15] <maasha> ok
[00:20:20] <Cork> EnginA: its just 9 lines of code
[00:20:26] <ajpiano> maasha: there is <input type="range"> in newer browsers
[00:21:14] <Cork> EnginA: http://jsfiddle.net/rb2ne/3/
[00:21:37] <maasha> ajpiano: neat.
[00:22:04] <maasha> So what can be another term for such a slider? What is it called on an equalizer (I need a term to search for - and slider is pretty bad).
[00:22:36] <ajpiano> why don't you use the jquery ui one?
[00:22:39] <ajpiano> what are you looking for
[00:23:37] <maasha> ajpiano: I am just looking for alternatives before trying the jquiry ui one. Or is jquery ui considered best option in general?
[00:23:59] <Angryasian> jquery ui has a horizontal "equalizer" they might even have a vertical one
[00:24:18] <maasha> Angryasian: yup, there are different flavors.
[00:24:49] <marinade> one day i will fix it, one day
[00:24:50] <marinade> LOL
[00:24:59] <ajpiano> maasha: it's part of jquery ui, it's supported by the jquery foundation, well documented etc
[00:25:33] <Angryasian> cool. I'd probably just blindly use the jqueryui one.
[00:26:02] <marinade> hey ajpiano how come this does not resize for me on my website which i am developing locally  http://jsfiddle.net/HbYtK/11/
[00:26:08] * maasha goes blind
[00:26:09] <maasha> thanks
[00:26:18] <ajpiano> marinade: i don't know
[00:26:24] <marinade> instead i get Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fitVids'
[00:26:47] <marinade> ajpiano i went through your neat website and elarned how to place a debugger
[00:26:51] <ajpiano> marinade: i am up late working on a presentation, i can't debug specific issues right now
[00:26:52] <marinade> but i don't know what to do next
[00:26:54] <ajpiano> awesome
[00:27:10] <marinade> :(
[00:27:11] <ajpiano> if the plugin is coming up undefined, it would seem that it isn't loading properly
[00:27:25] <ajpiano> or another version of jQuery is being loaded and replacing the one into which the plugin has loaded
[00:27:29] <ajpiano> or something else along those lines
[00:27:58] <marinade> jQuery(function($) {     $("article").fitVids(); });
[00:28:33] <Cork> O_o
[00:28:43] <Cork> you still haven't gotten it running?
[00:28:44] <marinade> lol
[00:28:48] <marinade> nope
[00:28:59] <Cork> didn't the fiddle work for you?
[00:29:01] <marinade> Cork its still giving me Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'fitVids'
[00:29:11] <marinade> Cork its not resizing for me on the fiddle
[00:29:11] <Cork> on the jsfiddle page?
[00:29:20] <Cork> the last one /11 ?
[00:29:26] <ajpiano> marinade: the problem is related to the loading of the plugin
[00:29:26] <marinade> but the other working example i showed you was resizing
[00:29:36] <ajpiano> showing us examples of you trying to insantiate it will not remedy that
[00:30:00] <marinade> LOl just learned a new word
[00:30:11] <marinade> yea its my first ever experience with jquery
[00:30:12] <ItsJustMe> Topic: jQuery 1.8.3? Did I miss the relase? o.o
[00:30:20] <ajpiano> instantiate
[00:30:24] <ajpiano> ItsJustMe: it's mid-release
[00:30:26] <marinade> yea
[00:30:41] <ItsJustMe> okay ..
[00:30:42] <marinade> ajpiano how would i go about resolving the issue?
[00:30:48] <ajpiano> dave did the blog post today but we still have to update teh download page, tweet, etc
[00:31:25] <ajpiano> marinade: use your console to determine if the path to the scrript is correct, to see if other copies of jQuery are being loaded at the wrong time, etc
[00:31:56] <ItsJustMe> ajpiano: so you're one of the leader of the platform? :)
[00:32:22] <ajpiano> yes, you could say that :)
[00:32:38] <ItsJustMe> That's pretty cool!
[00:33:02] <marinade> so ajpiano the problem is with fitvids script itself and not the aprt where i recall it in my global.js file with jQuery(function($) {     $("article").fitVids(); });
[00:33:21] <ajpiano> marinade: the problem is that the script is not being loaded properly!!!!!
[00:33:53] <ajpiano> see the last bullet point on http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide8
[00:33:53] <Angryasian> are you loading the script BEFORE using the .fitVits() method? Double check that.
[00:34:16] <ajpiano> ItsJustMe: indeed :)
[00:34:31] <marinade> ajpiano you mean like how i have it like this in the footer.php 	<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script> 	<script src="/js/global.js"></script>
[00:34:52] <ajpiano> perhaps, i have no idea what is happening in "global.js"
[00:34:59] <ajpiano> are you ever actually including the fitVids plugin?
[00:35:07] <ajpiano> is it inlined inside of global.js ?
[00:35:23] <marinade> ajpiano voila my global.js http://pastie.org/5375963
[00:35:44] <ajpiano> marinade: sooooooo
[00:35:51] <ajpiano> where would you expect that the fitVids plugin is loaded in your page
[00:35:53] <ItsJustMe> How do I filter my output divs, based on the html5-data-attributes
[00:35:56] <ItsJustMe> ?
[00:36:08] <ajpiano> you load jQuery, then you load your custom script... but you never load the plugim
[00:36:10] <ajpiano> plugin*
[00:36:14] <ajpiano> ItsJustMe: see ?filter
[00:36:16] <bot-t> ItsJustMe, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[00:36:54] <marinade> ajpiano thar she blows http://pastie.org/5375965
[00:37:34] <ajpiano> marinade: i think you think i know a lot more about your site than i do
[00:37:44] <ItsJustMe> Does filter loop through all divs with that class?
[00:37:49] <ajpiano> this is a template with a bunch of nested includes
[00:38:09] <ajpiano> marinade: you have to include a jQuery plugin after jQuery in your footer
[00:38:28] <NodeX> ?load
[00:38:28] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[00:38:29] <ItsJustMe> Okay, I think I'm just a bit confused .. Thanks aj ;D
[00:38:38] <ajpiano> <script src="jQuery.js"></script> <script src="jQuery.fitvids.js"></script> <script src="global.js"></script>
[00:38:52] <ajpiano> ItsJustMe: filter returns a new set, filtering it by the selector
[00:39:11] <ajpiano> $("div.foo").filter("[data-bar='baz']")
[00:39:52] <ItsJustMe> is it also possible using something like [data-bar>='5' && data-bar<='10']?
[00:40:16] <ajpiano> ItsJustMe: you'd use a function parameter for that
[00:40:46] <marinade> ajpiano OMG
[00:40:51] <marinade> Cork OMG
[00:40:55] <marinade> I can sleeep now
[00:40:57] <ajpiano> .filter(function(i, el) {  var bar = $(el).data("bar");  return bar > 5 && bar < 10; });
[00:41:08] <marinade> but still be late for spanish class tomrow LOL
[00:41:16] <marinade> its aliveee
[00:42:14] <ItsJustMe> ajpiano: You won't believe how much I love ya' for that! :D
[00:42:19] <ItsJustMe> Thanks so much :)
[00:42:25] <marinade> ajpiano i was following chris coyiers css-tricks website redesgin tutorial and he uses codekit whiich is why he didnt have this line or didnt need it <script src="path/to/jquery.fitvids.js"></script>
[00:42:26] <ajpiano> :)
[00:42:47] <marinade> he said that fitvids would automaitcally be apart of global.js
[00:43:09] <ajpiano> mmkay
[00:44:34] <marinade> any idea ajpiano why he doesnt need <script src="path/to/jquery.fitvids.js"></script> because all he siad he needs to have is this jQuery(function($) {     $("article").fitVids(); }); in his global.js file?
[00:44:58] <marinade> if u dont know its ok. its my last question
[00:45:16] <ajpiano> having not looked at the tutorial
[00:45:22] <ajpiano> it looks to me like he is explicitly saying to you
[00:45:53] <ajpiano> <script src="include/the/plugin/locally/and/put/the/path/to/the/jquery.fitvids.js"></script>
[00:46:28] <ajpiano> he's saying that in global.js, you just have to *call* the plugin to use it. beforehand you have to LOAD it so there is something to call in global.js
[00:47:01] <marinade> ajpiano thats the thing i have the fitvids file in my local js folder
[00:47:07] <marinade> right next to global.js
[00:47:22] <marinade> but thanks for ur help dude
[00:47:29] <ajpiano> the browser doesn't magically just pick out files to load cause they are in the same directory as files you are loading
[00:47:38] <marinade> a rough first experience with jquery but i survived
[00:47:50] <ajpiano> woo hoo
[00:47:55] <ajpiano> it will get better
[00:48:24] <marinade> OHHH i know ajpiano he uses codekit and he dragged fitvids to go under global.js. something which  i couldnt do with scoutapp
[00:48:39] <ajpiano> ah
[00:48:41] <AL13N_work> if i have a TR with 2 TD's and each has an input element, what if i move focus from the first input and go to the 2nd input, will the blur even on the TR trigger?
[00:48:46] <AL13N_work> *event
[00:48:56] <ajpiano> in general it isn't a good idea to assume that anyone you encounter knows every detail of any tutorial you are following
[00:48:56] <marinade> but i understand now my mistake. Thanks bro goodnight/goodmorning
[00:49:03] <ajpiano> have a good night, good luck in spanish
[00:49:04] <ajpiano> :)
[00:49:27] <marinade> ciao :)
[00:50:23] <AL13N_work> i mean, does the blur event go cascadingly to it's parents? or is there a mechanism that doesn't go further than where the new element has focus?
[00:54:16] <ajpiano> AL13N_work: the blur event is artificially bubbled by jQuery
[00:54:32] <ajpiano> in the browser by default, focus and blur events don't bubble at al
[00:54:44] <ajpiano> are you not able to catch a blur on the TR?
[00:55:58] <EnginA> Cork: it's not type, it's dataType :) in the .ajax options
[00:56:05] <EnginA> hence it was falling back to normal XHR
[00:56:06] <ItsJustMe> ajpiano: may I pm you? :)
[00:56:17] <ajpiano> sure, it's not really a great time
[00:56:23] <ajpiano> for me to get involved with anything in detail
[01:00:34] <aqeel> hi room
[01:01:04] <EnginA> now I corrected the .ajax call with dataType: 'script', now it can detect errors on 404 but not on host fails
[01:01:12] <EnginA> i.e. timeout on connecting to the serve
[01:04:04] <AL13N_work> ajpiano: well, i would like for it not to blur on TR when it's still contained within, but it seems i don't get any blur on TR no matter what
[01:04:22] <ajpiano> which version of jquery are you using
[01:05:28] <aqeel> which browser and which jquery are u using
[01:06:16] <AL13N_work> jsbin 1.7.2
[01:06:23] <AL13N_work> FF 10.010
[01:06:57] <AL13N_work> aqeel: ajpiano: http://jsbin.com/ofaluq/1/edit
[01:07:15] <AL13N_work> ah no 1.8.2
[01:08:02] <aqeel> it is working in my side
[01:08:14] <AL13N_work> i don't see the table and tr being colored
[01:08:19] <AL13N_work> only the inputs
[01:08:31] <aqeel> r u sure
[01:08:40] <AL13N_work> i'll refresh
[01:09:19] <AL13N_work> pretty sure
[01:09:31] <AL13N_work> i run it, and press TAB 3 times
[01:09:35] <ajpiano> AL13N_work: http://jsbin.com/ofaluq/2/
[01:09:41] <AL13N_work> the table and tr aren't being colored
[01:10:11] <aqeel> use mouse click
[01:10:35] <AL13N_work> ajpiano: i should use focusin/focusout isntead?
[01:10:36] <aqeel> tab a;so working
[01:10:44] <aqeel> also*
[01:11:10] <AL13N_work> tx ajpiano
[01:11:54] <AL13N_work> ajpiano: aqeel: now that this is working, i want the tr not to have the focusout on the first TAB, but still on the second TAB press
[01:11:54] <ajpiano> yeah, seems like it
[01:12:16] <AL13N_work> anyway how i can do this?
[01:12:24] <ajpiano> AL13N_work: you are going to have to keep track of the last blurred element
[01:12:32] <ajpiano> and then on subsequent blurs
[01:12:50] <ajpiano> test to see if the inputs are contained by the same TR
[01:13:08] <AL13N_work> is this gonna be expensive?
[01:13:09] <ajpiano> ?jQuery.contains
[01:13:09] <bot-t> jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[01:13:11] <ajpiano> will be your friend
[01:13:14] <ajpiano> no it should be pretty cheap
[01:13:19] <AL13N_work> ok, thx
[01:13:22] <AL13N_work> i'll try
[01:16:59] <AL13N_work> ajpiano: hmm, the focusout happens first
[01:17:40] <ajpiano> yeah you are going to have to experiment a bit, i can't dig into trying to code it right now, sorry
[01:20:55] <AL13N_work> hmm, gonna do a different approach
[01:27:26] <kzrdt> hi, I want to replace all occurences of "/" in a string with .replace methods, how to escape it as the terms to be replaced must be written between "/" ?
[01:31:29] <swe_ET> Have an issue that my plugin doesnt seem to loda in IE 8,7,6 but in Ie9 and FF, Chrome, Safari
[01:32:09] <aqeel> might be feature problem....that 6,7,8 do not have
[01:34:15] <swe_ET> $.fn.My...
[01:35:14] <roto3> hi
[01:35:47] <roto3> I have a problem, sometimes the code included in jQuery(function($) { appears don't works
[01:35:53] <roto3> I must reload the page for execute
[01:36:42] <roto3> i've tried with jQuery(function($) { , $(document).ready(function() {, $(function() { ...
[01:43:11] <Angryasian> roto3: what errors do you see in the console when it does not work?
[01:44:17] <roto3> I haven't error Angryasian, I'm thinking maybe is caching
[01:44:19] <swe_ET> http://jsfiddle.net/micaelbolognini/pSGX6/
[01:44:32] <roto3> i'm using jquery mobile
[01:44:46] <Angryasian> well then just make sure you are including all your scripts in the correct order.
[01:45:00] <Xtrivity> Hey guys. if you have a function that you want to take out of an event... how would you use $(this). as when i attempt to use that, it does not work.
[01:45:00] <Angryasian> roto3: gotcha
[01:45:28] <Angryasian> do you have a jsfiddle Xtrivity?
[01:45:30] <Xtrivity> For example, a function outside of an "on click" function.
[01:46:26] <Xtrivity> http://jsfiddle.net/cnWHs/
[01:47:27] <roto3> hehe, I'm chaning ther order but order is correct. The script calling to documen ready is the last in the list
[01:47:41] <roto3> changing*
[01:48:58] <roto3> when I redirect to other page, not load javascript, only if I press F5. No errors or warnings in console
[01:50:46] <Xtrivity> Angryasian ?
[01:51:04] <Angryasian> yeah well slider0 is the id of some slider i presume
[01:51:19] <Angryasian> this refers to the javascript object window
[01:51:29] <Angryasian> you cant use 'this' unless its in a jquery function
[01:51:47] <ajpiano> Xtrivity: you can either pass along the event object
[01:51:52] <ajpiano> so that the function can use it
[01:52:05] <ajpiano> or you can use function call/apply method to invoke that function in the same scope
[01:52:10] <Angryasian> so you have to do stuff similar to what you have already done. $("#" + slider).addClass("current");   //add class to current slide or you can pass 'this' in the onClick event
[01:52:43] <ajpiano> Xtrivity: http://jsfiddle.net/cnWHs/1/
[01:52:56] <ajpiano> Xtrivity: or you can pass 'this' in as an argument, as Angryasian says
[01:53:22] <ajpiano> Xtrivity: also in that function it makes a lot more sense to do if ( !$(this).hasClass("active") ) { }
[01:53:24] <Angryasian> you're doing a lot of very different things in the animateSlide method, I would suggest not using it
[01:55:20] <Angryasian> $(".current").attr("id") for example is most likely not going to do what you think it does. Since there might be multiple things with a class of current.
[01:57:06] <Xtrivity> Angryasian: i have the exact code working when it's not inside a function.
[01:57:32] <Xtrivity> but when it's inside a function $(this) <- does  not work... so i want to know how to solve that
[01:57:38] <Xtrivity> I know therels a shortcut like _self = $this
[01:57:42] <Xtrivity> but i'm not positive how or what it is
[01:58:26] <Angryasian> I'm sure it works for your current scenario. But the type of things you are doing in your code wont work if there are two sliders on your page or for a bunch of other scenarios. Just wanting to alert you to that possibility.
[01:58:49] <Xtrivity> Angryasian: i know what i'm doing in terms of that. No worries
[01:59:09] <Xtrivity> I just want to know how to use (this) inside a function.
[01:59:32] <Angryasian> ok cool. I hope you've figured out how to solve the 'this' issue now.
[01:59:38] <ajpiano> Xtrivity: http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/
[01:59:45] <Angryasian> just do what ajpiano linked.
[02:00:38] <Xtrivity> lol Angryasian....
[02:02:54] <Angryasian> I thought there was only one way to use 'this' outside of a jquery function. ajpiano now gave me another way. so you can either do http://jsfiddle.net/cnWHs/1/ or something like this http://jsfiddle.net/cnWHs/2/
[02:03:52] <Cork> Angryasian: ya, if you use call or apply you can pass what variable should be this
[02:06:32] <Xtrivity> Angryasian so esentially it'd be animateSlide(slider).call(this);
[02:06:56] <Xtrivity> nope, that' doesnt work.
[02:07:15] <Angryasian> I meant to write this: http://jsfiddle.net/cnWHs/3/
[02:07:45] <Xtrivity> Angryasian: doesn't work.. the function has a argument
[02:07:58] <Xtrivity> as well as wanting to pass 'this'
[02:08:15] <Angryasian> just the first line. 'this' doesnt exist in your function.
[02:08:44] <ajpiano> every function has a this
[02:09:25] <Xtrivity> animateSlide(slider).call(this); syntax is incorrect. Am i doing animateSlide(.call(this), slider) or am i doing animateSlide(this, slider)
[02:09:27] <Angryasian> ajpiano well the 'this' in a regular function always refers to window by default?
[02:09:31] <Xtrivity> just curious best practices.
[02:09:37] <ajpiano> Angryasian: yes
[02:09:55] <Angryasian> Xtrivity http://jsfiddle.net/cnWHs/4/ is the only thing i was trying to demonstrate.
[02:09:58] <ajpiano> Xtrivity: it's really a matter of preference at that point
[02:10:17] <ajpiano> realistically you could just be doing .click( animateSlide );
[02:10:21] <ajpiano> then the function would take place in scope
[02:10:32] <Xtrivity> Angryasian. I dont want slider to be this though....
[02:10:40] <Xtrivity> I want slider to be something else passed.
[02:11:13] <Xtrivity> ajpiano: makes sense.
[02:11:16] <ajpiano> Xtrivity: you shouldn't have to have that part where you know that music triggers slide0 hardcoded in your JS
[02:11:30] <ajpiano> you should be able to figure that out by some interrogation of the dom element, perhaps a data attribute, etc
[02:11:36] <Angryasian> then put in TWO arguments. But if you want 'this' to be the thing with id of music. then you have to use the .call method like ajpiano mentioned.
[02:11:44] <ajpiano> then essentially the problem goes away
[02:13:14] <ItsJustMe> ajpiano: You gave me this: .filter(function(i, el) {  var bar = $(el).data("bar"); return bar > 5 && bar < 10; }); Seems like I'm too silly to use it ^^
[02:13:29] <ajpiano> i am sorry for that
[02:13:33] <Xtrivity> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/cnWHs/5/ that does not work.
[02:13:51] <ItsJustMe> Made $(".offer_webspace").filter(function(i, el) {  var domains = $(el).data("domains"); return domains > 5 && domains < 10; }); from it - but has no affect =/
[02:13:52] <ajpiano> Xtrivity: that's a completely different thing entirely
[02:14:04] <ajpiano> ItsJustMe: filter doesn't *do*
[02:14:05] <ajpiano> anything
[02:14:08] <ajpiano> it just ... gives you a collection
[02:14:19] <ajpiano> you have to call .hide() or osmething
[02:14:56] <ajpiano> Xtrivity: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[02:15:14] <Angryasian> Filter narrows down things. compare console.log($(".offer_webspace")) to console.log($(".offer_webspace").filter(function(i, el) {  var domains = $(el).data("domains"); return domains > 5 && domains < 10; });
[02:15:39] <Angryasian> I'm missing a parenthesis
[02:15:56] <ajpiano> Xtrivity: i'm saying you shouldn't have hardcoded "slider0" anywhere in your code for organisational purposes
[02:16:06] <ajpiano> in terms of the binding you have to do a functoin reference, not execute a function in place
[02:17:17] <Xtrivity> ajpiano, i'm not a fast coder, and i dont have the time to create something super complicated
[02:17:30] <ajpiano> ok
[02:17:32] <Xtrivity> hard coded works just fine for what i need to accomplish right now. nothing all that complex.
[02:17:37] <ajpiano> mmkay
[02:17:59] <Xtrivity> I know if i had more time i would do it the other way, calculate the amount of slides, blah blah. but i no can do.
[02:18:01] <ajpiano> sometimes in the course of someone handing you a fish, you accidentally learn something about how to fish for yourself
[02:18:31] <ajpiano> there are worse things :)
[02:18:52] <NodeX> anyone know how to cast to bool values from "data" ?
[02:19:07] <NodeX> Boolean(element.data('foo')); does not work
[02:19:20] <ItsJustMe> Oh, you're right .. Thanks aj, thanks angry :)
[02:19:50] <Xtrivity> anyways, thanks ajpiano.
[02:19:54] <Xtrivity> and Angryasian.
[02:20:04] <Xtrivity> who should be a ^_^asian instead
[02:20:26] <ajpiano> NodeX: if you have "true" or "false" in a data attribute, it will be coerced to a boolean simply from reading it
[02:20:38] <ajpiano> NodeX: http://jsfiddle.net/b3QAF/
[02:21:15] <NodeX> ajpiano : not in my jquery version for some reason
[02:21:48] <NodeX> a bool true/false is what I'm after
[02:21:57] <NodeX> data-foo="true" .....
[02:22:03] <ajpiano> what version of jquery
[02:22:10] <NodeX> if(element.data('foo')) {.... do somehting
[02:23:33] <EnginA> You can search for "jQuery.ajaxTransport( "script", function(s) {" in the source code to find, how the script ajax request is sent, it does not listen for onerror event.
[02:23:45] <EnginA> hence error detection is not working with script
[02:24:31] <roto3> Angryasian: when I try the console for debug a script, the scripts loaded in the console not corresponds with the .js included in the file
[02:24:31] <NodeX> seems it's a javascript thing - typecasting strings to bool is not so straightforward
[02:24:44] <roto3> are the .js of last file. Only load correct files after F5
[02:25:17] <ajpiano> ?eval Boolean("true')
[02:25:23] <bot-t> ajpiano: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
[02:25:27] <ajpiano> ?eval Boolean("true")
[02:25:27] <bot-t> ajpiano: true
[02:25:33] <ajpiano> ?eval typeof Boolean("true")
[02:25:33] <bot-t> ajpiano: "boolean"
[02:25:55] <ajpiano> ?eval Boolean("false") === false
[02:25:56] <bot-t> ajpiano: false
[02:26:17] <ajpiano> ?eval Boolean("false")
[02:26:17] <bot-t> ajpiano: true
[02:26:23] <NodeX> ^^ that's the caveat
[02:26:39] <ajpiano> i mean the easiest thing is obviously
[02:26:59] <ajpiano> foo = (foo == "true")
[02:27:00] <NodeX> regex I suppose or a tenery
[02:27:13] <NodeX> but I thought there might be a nicer way
[02:27:36] <NodeX> can I assume that data-foo=true is invalid?
[02:28:21] <ajpiano> the data attr parsing seems to do it ok
[02:28:22] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/b3QAF/1/
[02:30:23] <NodeX> this is strange, data-addOverlay="true" .... element.data('addOverlay') <---- is false
[02:30:52] <ajpiano> there's crazy stuff that goes on with the camel casing of data attrs in the auto parsing
[02:31:03] <ajpiano> NodeX: leave it in your html as data-add-overlay
[02:32:00] <NodeX> I didn't realise one could add more hyphens
[02:32:30] <ajpiano> yea, the way it does it is that it converts hyphens in the name to camelCase when you read it
[02:32:32] <EnginA> hmm, jsfiddle seems to be not working with IE8
[02:32:57] <ajpiano> and lowercasing otherwise
[02:33:07] <ajpiano> so data-fooBar-baz would be readable as .data("foobarBaz")
[02:33:08] <NodeX> that works fine with hyphens, how crazy is that
[02:33:09] <ajpiano> >:|
[02:33:24] <NodeX> thanks ;)
[02:33:28] <Cork> EnginA: ya, it bugz out quite badly
[02:33:28] <NodeX> saved me a headache
[02:33:46] <Cork> EnginA: you can use the direct access though
[02:36:13] <roto3> Angryasian, or something. I resolve the problem, must put data-ajax="false" in <a> tag for prevent this issue
[02:36:21] <roto3> using jquerymobile
[02:58:06] <venks> Hello, I'm trying to use qtip to display a span title as a nice-looking tooltip but the span itself is dynamically created due to which it's not working.
[03:03:06] <venks> http://jsfiddle.net/qVACm/1/ demonstrates that it works when element is static. Any clues on how to make it work when span element is dynamically created?
[03:08:08] <quicksilver> venks: you have to re-call .qtip() on added content
[03:08:13] <quicksilver> with appropriate selector.
[03:09:08] <quicksilver> although I see other people have suggested using a delegated mouseover/focus handler to add qtips to new content
[03:09:11] <quicksilver> which is pretty smart.
[03:10:57] <venks> I've read about delegation being the way to go or calling .live() but unsure of what changes to make exactly as I'm a JS noob
[03:35:55] <Xtrivity> http://jsfiddle.net/XKdqB/
[03:35:58] <Xtrivity> Whoops.
[03:36:15] <Xtrivity> Sorry guys haha. Is there a way to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/XKdqB/ .. essentially i think im on the right track, but it doens't work.
[03:36:58] <Xtrivity> whoops: updated: http://jsfiddle.net/XKdqB/1/
[03:38:48] <Xtrivity> I'm trying to use $(this) as a selector and grab the related div
[03:40:57] <ItsJustMe> I want to filter out offers, with price-values between 500 and 1000 .. Where's my mistake? ._. http://jsfiddle.net/fq5Yr/
[03:41:47] <ItsJustMe> Okay, found first one ^^
[03:41:55] <ItsJustMe> && instead of ||
[03:42:31] <ItsJustMe> http://jsfiddle.net/fq5Yr/1/
[03:42:34] <quicksilver> Xtrivity: the syntax for finding as a descendant of this is backwards.
[03:42:41] <quicksilver> Xtrivity: it's $(".spin",this)
[03:42:49] <quicksilver> although I rather hate that syntax.
[03:42:56] <quicksilver> I use $(this).find('.spin')
[03:43:28] <bnb_dev> Hello ALL!
[03:45:16] <bnb_dev> I am using jquery ui autocomplete remote-with-cache, it creates the autocomplete but do not show it
[03:50:04] <quicksilver> ItsJustMe: you surely want $(this).data("price-month")
[03:51:52] <ItsJustMe> quicksilver: how did you knew that? o.o
[03:51:58] <ItsJustMe> you're totally right! ^-^
[03:52:59] <quicksilver> ItsJustMe: $(".foo").data("blah") will always return the data of the first match of ".foo"
[03:53:07] <quicksilver> that's not very useful
[03:53:50] <ItsJustMe> Is it normal that I have to negate it now? return !(price >= 500 && price <= 1000);
[03:54:03] * Cork hands quicksilver an array of blahs
[03:55:26] <Cork> ItsJustMe: depends on what you want
[03:55:31] <quicksilver> ItsJustMe: depends whether or not you read the documentation for filter and understood it :)
[03:55:46] <quicksilver> did you want the products between 500 and 1000 or the products *not* between 500 and 1000? :)
[03:55:55] <ItsJustMe> the ones between ..
[03:56:02] <ItsJustMe> and i haven't really understood it ^^
[03:56:06] <ItsJustMe> I'm a dumb german xD
[03:56:45] <ItsJustMe> but negated it works .. so i think it is normal?
[03:57:13] <Cork> that sounds weird
[03:57:36] <Cork> ?eval var price = 600; if(price >= 500 && price <= 1000) { "include"; }
[03:57:41] <bot-t> Cork: "include"
[03:58:05] <Cork> ItsJustMe: you're sure you get a number?
[03:58:37] <Cork> and not something like "600,0"
[03:58:52] <ItsJustMe> nope .. i get something like 699 or 457
[03:58:55] <ItsJustMe> no commata
[03:59:04] <ItsJustMe> $(".offer_webspace").filter(function(i, el) {  var price = $(this).data("price-month"); return !(price >= 500 && price <= 1000); }).hide();
[03:59:15] <ItsJustMe> this makes, that i get everything between 500 and 1000 ^^
[03:59:59] <Cork> ItsJustMe: could you add one of those elements in the jsfiddle?
[04:00:09] <ItsJustMe> sure ^^
[04:00:10] <quicksilver> ItsJustMe: yes
[04:00:18] <quicksilver> ItsJustMe: because your filter returns all the ones *not* between 500 and 1000
[04:00:19] <Cork> ah, you hide them
[04:00:22] <quicksilver> ItsJustMe: and then you call .hide()
[04:00:30] <quicksilver> so you're hiding the ones not between 500 and 1000
[04:00:42] <quicksilver> so which ones would you expect to be still visible? :)
[04:00:45] <ItsJustMe> so everythings fine and the ! is not wrong ^^
[04:01:01] <ItsJustMe> cork: do you want
[04:01:05] <ItsJustMe> the fiddle anyway?
[04:01:09] <Cork> na
[04:01:13] <ItsJustMe> ok ^^
[04:01:23] <Cork> i would prob go with return price < 500 || price > 1000; then
[04:01:28] <Cork> cause that's what you want
[04:01:34] <Cork> and its clearer
[04:01:36] <theForce> hi
[04:01:55] <Cork> (cause you want to hide all elements not in that range)
[04:02:53] * quicksilver hands cork a table of demorgan identities.
[04:04:14] * Cork studies the identities, and wonder what he should do with them
[04:05:32] <ItsJustMe> Cork: You're right as always .. It's really clearer :)
[04:10:57] <theForce> i have a website on which tooltips are added to certain elements like that: $('*[rel=tooltip]').tooltip(). now the problem is that when i load html via ajax the tooltip is not applied automatically to the loaded html elements. how can i do that apart from adding a new .tooltip() statement in the ajax html?
[04:11:56] <Cork> theForce: you can't
[04:12:21] <Cork> theForce: you can only solve it if there is a way to make it a delegated action (event listener)
[04:12:31] <Cork> not if you need to call a function on the element
[04:12:38] <theForce> Cork: can i maybe overwrite or extend $.ajax'es default success handler?
[04:12:55] <theForce> Cork: what do you mean by that?
[04:13:20] <Cork> theForce: if you want to listen for an event that can be done to work on elements not in the dom yet
[04:13:28] <Cork> theForce: thats called delegation
[04:13:55] <Cork> ex. $(parent).on('hover', '[*rel="tooltip"]', function() {});
[04:14:20] <Cork> but if you need to call a function on the element that's not event based and makes it harder to solve
[04:14:36] <theForce> hm ok
[04:14:54] <Cork> btw you should prob don't use rel for "tooltip"
[04:15:06] <Cork> use data-tooltip="true" or something
[04:15:21] <Cork> use the attributes for what they're meant for
[04:16:17] <theForce> Cork: you're right. in my defense, i did not implement that. maybe i'll refactor that in the future but right now it's not very high in the priority list. thanks for the info, though
[04:16:39] <Cork> ya, legacy code is what it is
[04:16:53] <Cork> and this isn't the worst i've seen
[04:17:05] <Cork> so it will prob not break in the foreseeable future
[04:17:13] <quicksilver> applying the tooltip on ajax success is one way
[04:17:28] <quicksilver> delegating focus/mouseenter to apply the tooltip 'just-in-time' is another way.
[04:17:56] <Cork> depending on the plugin used the later is prob the better solution
[04:18:11] <Cork> less event listeners, and a more stable code base
[04:18:44] <Cork> but the plugin really have to be written to support it for that to work
[04:19:02] <Cork> theForce: you're loading the html with the help of .load or something?
[04:19:19] <theForce> the plugin is twitter bootstrap tooltip
[04:20:02] <Cork> ?.ajaxSuccess
[04:20:04] <bot-t> .ajaxSuccess(handler): Attach a function to be executed whenever an Ajax request completes successfully. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[04:20:10] <Cork> you could try going that way
[04:21:24] <theForce> Cork:  this i would apply to the html body?
[04:22:05] <Cork> for example
[04:22:09] <theForce> ok
[04:22:10] <theForce> thx
[04:22:16] <Cork> where you bind it doesn't matter
[04:24:07] <theForce> ok that works. thanks a lot guys :-)
[04:31:55] <quicksilver> Cork: well you might devise one of a number of ways of checking if the tooltip had already been applied.
[04:32:44] <Cork> quicksilver: sure
[04:35:06] <Space-Duck> How can I perform multiple ajax (post) calls one after another upon a form submission?
[04:39:01] <fonko> guys if i go "return true;" inside an if inside a function... that should take me out of the if and keep going with the code inside function?
[04:40:01] <Space-Duck> fonko nope, that'll exit the entire function
[04:40:20] <fonko> Space-Duck, oh well that works fine for me :)
[04:40:21] <fonko> thanks sr
[04:50:01] <harami> hello, i am trying to hide empty p tags from the page, for example <p></p>, i am using the following code, but it isnt doing it http://pastebin.com/0JaLfRDx
[04:51:32] <Cork> harami: jQuery('.post-content p:empty').hide();
[04:51:48] <Cork> note though that it counts white spaces
[04:52:13] <Cork> ?eval $('<div> </div>').is(':empty')
[04:52:15] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: div is undefined
[04:52:22] <Cork> O_o
[04:52:34] <Cork> bot-t: you've lost your mind...
[04:52:35] <bot-t> Cork, Is that a question?
[04:54:35] <maasha> I think I saw a trick so us lt and gt inside a selector?
[04:54:47] <maasha> *to
[04:54:53] <maasha> *to use
[04:55:29] <Cork> ?:gt
[04:55:30] <bot-t> :gt(index): Select all elements at an index greater than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[04:55:32] <Cork> its not trick
[04:55:45] <Cork> its not the best performing selectors though
[04:56:03] <maasha> is it $('[name:gt(4)]') ?
[04:56:09] <Cork> no
[04:56:24] <Cork> you can't use it inside the attribute selectors
[04:56:34] <maasha> Cork: ok, so what is the best way if not inside the selector?
[04:56:41] <Trisox> :D
[04:56:49] <Cork> maasha: what is it you're trying to do?
[04:57:05] <Trisox> ?eq
[04:57:07] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[04:57:13] <Trisox> hmm
[04:57:13] <Cork> ?.gt
[04:57:14] <bot-t> :gt(index): Select all elements at an index greater than index within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/gt-selector/
[04:57:22] <Cork> ?.slice
[04:57:23] <Trisox> :D
[04:57:23] <bot-t> .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[04:57:32] <Trisox> slice !!
[04:57:37] <Trisox> Cork: cake plzzz
[04:57:51] <Cork> maasha: but if you want to run it on the name attribute those won't help you
[04:58:27] <Cork> those are for checking the element like the 5-10'th element that matched
[04:58:29] <Cork> or similar
[04:58:30] <maasha> Cork: so I have name attributes with values 0-8. I want to select those where values are e.g. lt 4
[04:58:44] <Cork> are those element's of a speciic type?
[04:58:51] <Cork> like input or something
[04:59:08] <Trisox> you have to loop it
[04:59:12] <maasha> Cork, they are <span>
[04:59:17] <Cork> ...
[04:59:20] <Trisox> and use attr to get the val..
[04:59:21] <Cork> name isn't valid on spans
[04:59:25] <Trisox> true
[04:59:33] <Trisox> use data-name=""
[04:59:37] <Cork> so lets make them data- ya :)
[04:59:59] <Cork> $('span').filter(function() { return $(this).data('name) > 4; })
[05:00:00] <maasha> right.
[05:00:07] <Cork> * $('span').filter(function() { return $(this).data('name') > 4; })
[05:00:16] <maasha> thanks
[05:00:27] <Trisox> Cork: +1
[05:01:28] * maasha fixed data-name
[05:05:28] <Trisox> what your working on Cork
[05:06:00] <Cork> a mobile control panel for our services
[05:06:16] <Trisox> cool
[05:06:26] <Cork> not really
[05:06:45] <Cork> all the bugs in the mobile browsers makes the job quite boring
[05:09:20] <Kambfhase> is it technically possible to bind an event handler to window?
[05:09:41] <Cork> yes
[05:09:53] <Trisox> yup
[05:09:56] <Kambfhase> or does $(window).bind() get forwarded to document.documentElement?
[05:09:59] <Cork> what events you can get there depends though
[05:10:03] <Cork> no
[05:10:17] <Trisox> Cork: that sounds like a bitch to do cause debugging on mobile devices sucks
[05:10:27] <Cork> ya
[05:10:46] <Kambfhase> mkay.
[05:10:49] <Cork> and the freeking annoying amount of different webkit browsers to test can make you cry
[05:11:02] <Trisox> i know
[05:11:14] <Cork> android 2.1-4.2 + iphone 1-5 :/
[05:11:21] <Trisox> thank got i only have to suport ios 6 up
[05:11:28] <Trisox> 5 up
[05:11:36] <Trisox> for ipad
[05:11:38] <Cork> thats 12 freeking browsers T_T
[05:11:48] <Trisox> got a lot of devices then
[05:11:59] <Cork> iphone ya
[05:12:05] <Trisox> its also very expensive work
[05:12:06] <Cork> android has emulators
[05:12:15] <Trisox> true
[05:12:25] <Cork> and they're actually really good
[05:12:31] <Trisox> like if something costs 100 min
[05:12:38] <Trisox> with mobile its 150 min
[05:12:54] <Trisox> atleast
[05:13:01] <Trisox> somtimes double..
[05:13:06] <Trisox> cause of the testing...
[05:13:17] <Cork> well i wouldn't complain if the browsers didn't have all kind of weird bugs
[05:13:18] <Trisox> thats just no fun
[05:13:31] <Trisox> like? for example?
[05:13:39] <Cork> mobile gecko and opera is actually the only browsers that doens't break for the simplest things
[05:13:47] <Trisox> :D
[05:13:48] <Cork> like z-index or position:
[05:13:55] <Trisox> oh hehe indeed
[05:14:03] <Cork> or overflow: scroll
[05:14:11] <Cork> or...
[05:14:16] <Trisox> overflow: scroll haha that one is easy
[05:14:31] <Cork> without reverting to javascript scrolls?
[05:14:38] <Trisox>         overflow: -moz-hidden-unscrollable;
[05:14:43] <Trisox> i think it was
[05:14:53] <Cork> uh.. for webkit browsers -_-'
[05:14:54] <Trisox>     -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
[05:14:59] <Cork> ah
[05:15:04] <Cork> AH!
[05:15:04] <Trisox> ;)
[05:15:08] <Cork> thx :)
[05:15:12] <Trisox> np
[05:15:39] <Trisox> my experience is that the inerit of position in mobile is sometimes weird
[05:15:50] <Cork> ya
[05:15:57] <Trisox> big blocks i mostly give a position just in case
[05:16:11] <Cork> and that you can click through elements in all kind of weird situations sucks too
[05:16:34] <Cork> like if you have a ling on the page and an overlay with a button on it
[05:16:47] <Cork> the click happens on the link in some versions :/
[05:16:51] <Trisox> like a dialog ?
[05:16:54] <Cork> ya
[05:17:04] <Cork> well its a bit simpler
[05:17:09] <Cork> its only an overlay
[05:17:12] <Trisox> k
[05:17:26] <Cork> but this feels like ie<7 all over again
[05:17:42] <Cork> one hack for each version of the browser
[05:17:51] <Cork> only this time its 12 copies of them >_>
[05:17:54] <Trisox> hmm
[05:17:57] <Cork> not just 3
[05:18:06] <Trisox> brb product owner walks in
[05:18:11] <Trisox> need him for some stuff ;)
[05:18:26] <Trudko> guys what i have selector $("#mydropdown").find("[data-auth='N']").remove(); I want to remove al options with data-auth attribute set to N except if it s current value of dropdown how to do that_
[05:19:02] <Cork> current value is dropdown?
[05:19:21] <Cork> you mean if its value is whats selected in a select box?
[05:20:21] <Cork> hmm no
[05:20:28] <Cork> Trudko: what is #mydropdown ?
[05:20:45] <Cork> or do you mean data-auth is on the option elements?
[05:20:51] <Trudko> Cork: select field
[05:21:02] <Cork> ah
[05:21:29] <Trudko> Cork: i will create js fiddlet
[05:21:52] <Cork> var dropdown = $("#mydropdown"); dropdown.find("[data-auth").not('[data-auth="' + dropdown.val() + '"]').remove();
[05:21:59] <Cork> that should give you what you want
[05:22:24] <Cork> lol no thats wrong
[05:23:01] <AndromedaK> Hi guys
[05:23:14] <AndromedaK> Could somebody let me know how can I fix it? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12641798/google-maps-api-v3-maps-in-ui-tabs-are-cut/13379389#13379389
[05:23:16] <AndromedaK> ?
[05:23:29] <AndromedaK> http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/9335/tabsandmaps.gif
[05:23:48] <ItsJustMe> Okay, I've searched now for about 2 hours .. How do I reset a filter?
[05:23:55] <AndromedaK> I found on my own a very bad workaround
[05:24:05] <Cork> Trudko: var dropdown = $("#mydropdown"); dropdown.find("[data-auth]").not('[value="' + dropdown.val() + '"]').remove();
[05:24:11] <ItsJustMe> It only works one time and if I remove my input - nothing re-appears ._.
[05:24:21] <Pnoexz> AndromedaK: this is ##PHP not #javascript
[05:24:29] <Pnoexz> oops
[05:24:30] <Cork> ItsJustMe: "reset" ?
[05:24:38] <Pnoexz> thats why you shouldnt have both channels open
[05:24:50] <AndromedaK> this is #jquery
[05:25:01] <Trudko> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/x35Tf/1/ as you can see my old code does also delete selected value it should not
[05:25:36] <ItsJustMe> I mean you type something into an input-field .. The function is called, everything gets filtered .. And afterwards nothing is happening .. You can add more to this input, delete the content .. But no offers re-appear ..
[05:25:43] <Cork> Trudko: ah, you would have to create a bit more complicated filter for that
[05:25:48] <Trudko> Cork: I need to delete all options which have data-auth set to N except selected value
[05:26:02] <swe_ET> var button = $('<button/>' , { class: 'someClass', text: 'someLabel'});
[05:26:06] <cuddle`> Hey, I have a generic programming question (can't join the specifycs channels), I noticed that sometimes in C++ as well as PHP code something like a datatype declaration precedes a variable, like so: (array) $arguments. Does anyone know what this is called and where I can find more info about it?
[05:26:12] <swe_ET> does not work in IE 6,7,8
[05:26:17] <Trudko> Cork yeah I thought so or I could remember selected value and re add it again  not sure what is better
[05:26:34] <Pnoexz> swe_ET: what are you trying to do? create a button?
[05:27:08] <swe_ET> I figured out that IE 6,7,8 thinks that class is a reserved word
[05:27:20] <Pnoexz> if so.. var button = document.createElement('button'); $(button).addClass('someClass').text('someText');
[05:27:24] <Pnoexz> swe_ET: ^
[05:27:42] <swe_ET> mine works aswell
[05:27:49] <Pnoexz> not it doesnt
[05:27:52] <Pnoexz> you just said it didnt
[05:27:55] <Cork> ItsJustMe: http://jsfiddle.net/x35Tf/2/
[05:28:16] <swe_ET> it did not work because of : class:
[05:28:17] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[05:28:26] <Cork> Trudko: ^
[05:28:27] <swe_ET> in just the three browsers
[05:28:43] <jax> hi
[05:28:52] <jax> shouldn't this find <a data-rel="day-link" … a[data-rel=day-link] ?
[05:28:57] <swe_ET> if I put it as { 'class':  .. it works
[05:29:02] <Cork> ItsJustMe: link?
[05:29:09] <ItsJustMe> :D
[05:29:14] <Pnoexz> jax: a[data-rel="day-link"]
[05:29:19] <jax> duh
[05:29:30] <Pnoexz> common mistake
[05:30:01] <AndromedaK> How can I trigger my javascript function in case I click on my map_tab
[05:30:02] <AndromedaK> ?
[05:30:16] <AndromedaK> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12641798/google-maps-api-v3-maps-in-ui-tabs-are-cut/13379389#13379389
[05:30:27] <AndromedaK> map_canvas
[05:30:29] <AndromedaK> I mean
[05:30:41] <jax> hm, still not working
[05:30:46] <Pnoexz> AndromedaK: $('map_tab_selector').on('click',function(){ yourFunction(); });
[05:30:56] <jax> $('a[data-rel="day-link"]').on('click', function(event) { alert('hi'); });
[05:31:08] <jax> should work on <a href="…" data-rel="day-link" ..> ?
[05:31:58] <ItsJustMe> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/GFd53/
[05:32:00] <Pnoexz> i dont remember xpaths much, but maybe you have to parse the -?
[05:32:01] <jax> eh i put it in ready
[05:32:02] <jax> that's why
[05:32:03] <Pnoexz> jax: ^
[05:32:11] <Trudko> Cork: great thanks is this time consuming for browsers like IE6/IE7 (yes I HAVE to test on those too)
[05:32:28] <Trudko> or I take that back i will just test it my self
[05:33:51] <Cork> Trudko: not really
[05:34:02] <Cork> its a fairly simple loop
[05:39:18] <khaan> hi everybody. Suppose i want to have a sliding panel over a whole page, moving away or reappearing on click, and it has to remember its position with cookies: which is the fastest and most painless way to do it? :)
[05:39:19] <bot-t> (39 hours 30 secs ago) <lathan> tell khaan this is close: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/KVTh2/
[05:40:05] <AndromedaK> Anybody knows?
[05:43:17] <khaan> uhm, i don't see the point (and if i run the demo it's not working :| )
[05:43:20] <khaan> sorry :)
[05:47:39] <kzrdt> does someone know a free equivalent to this plugin : http://codecanyon.net/item/graphup-jquery-plugin/108025?ref=1stwebdesigner&clickthrough_id=20649442&redirect_back=true ?
[06:01:04] <reloadz> hi! why i can select $(".ctg:visible") when .ctg { display: none;}
[06:04:25] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. I need to figure out a script that removes li's in a list, but not li's (and their childs) if they have the class 'noremove'. Take a look at this: http://pastebin.com/xHJHPqfd (jsfiddle is unfortunately down, so can't use that)
[06:04:27] <jaffipaffi> Any ideas?
[06:04:56] <Pnoexz> :not .noremove
[06:05:18] <Pnoexz> jaffipaffi: http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[06:05:22] <jaffipaffi> Pnoexz: But it shouldn't remove the childs?
[06:05:58] <Pnoexz> you are using a question mark in a statement, im lost
[06:07:35] <jaffipaffi> Pnoexz: I have tried $('li').not('.noremove').remove(); and it doesn't work properly
[06:07:42] <jaffipaffi> Because
[06:07:53] <jaffipaffi> It doesn't check if the current li has a child with the .noremove class
[06:07:55] <Pnoexz> jaffipaffi: you are not using it right
[06:08:14] <jaffipaffi> How should I use it then?
[06:08:37] <AndromedaK> Pnoexz:
[06:08:49] <AndromedaK> I didn't solve my problem is like that
[06:08:56] <AndromedaK> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[06:09:03] <AndromedaK> but I http://www.essentialwebconcepts.com/blog/2011/03/22/fixing-google-maps-rendering-problem-in-jquery-accordion/
[06:09:11] <AndromedaK> but I use tabs not accordion
[06:09:22] <AndromedaK> so I was looking for what I should bind
[06:09:45] <AndromedaK> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12641798/google-maps-api-v3-maps-in-ui-tabs-are-cut/13379389#13379389
[06:10:08] <AndromedaK> this is the behaviour http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/9335/tabsandmaps.gif
[06:10:21] <Pnoexz> jaffipaffi: $('li *:not(.noremove)) and then remove the parent node, you can also change the * for the specific element the child is
[06:11:43] <jaffipaffi> Pnoexz: Still not working as I want
[06:11:55] <jaffipaffi> it removes all child nodes of "Item 3"
[06:12:04] <jaffipaffi> Even though Item 3.1 has class="noremove"
[06:12:23] <Pnoexz> move the noremove to the parent li then
[06:12:44] <jaffipaffi> Pnoexz: Not what I want
[06:12:50] <jaffipaffi> And I can't change that
[06:12:56] <jaffipaffi> It have to look recursively
[06:12:57] <Pnoexz> jaffipaffi: well, good luck with that
[06:18:28] <reloadz> hi! why i can select $(".ctg:visible") when .ctg { display: none;}
[06:19:31] <Anticom> hi all... i want to get all attribute values of a certain type of a set of selected elements returned into an array. http://jsfiddle.net/wmce6/2/ this seems close, but the rerurned stuff contains dom references aswell
[06:19:47] <Anticom> i just don't get, how to get all href's in a single array
[06:19:48] <Pnoexz> reloadz: because :visible selects only visible elements
[06:19:58] <Pnoexz> if its not visible, it doesnt select it
[06:20:20] <reloadz> but it still reacts as it ir visible....
[06:20:37] <Pnoexz> but you are telling it to select only the visible elements
[06:20:51] <Pnoexz> and since its not visible......
[06:22:31] <Kambfhase> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/wmce6/3/
[06:23:14] <AdamPDotty> Is there something working like $('iframe').load(function(){}); ?
[06:23:42] <Pnoexz> AdamPDotty: you trying to run a function when the iframe loads?
[06:23:58] <AdamPDotty> yes or after that
[06:24:31] <Pnoexz> $(selector).on('load',function(){      });
[06:24:38] <Pnoexz> AdamPDotty: ^
[06:24:41] <reloadz> Pnoexz: http://jsfiddle.net/wNBpd/ - it should not alert anything!
[06:25:17] <reloadz> http://jsfiddle.net/wNBpd/3/
[06:25:54] <AdamPDotty> I tried $().on('load', 'iframe', function(){alert(18);}); . I got 8 Iframes, but no alert.
[06:25:57] <Pnoexz> reloadz: because $(".ctg:visible") doesnt return false
[06:26:02] <Kambfhase> reloadz: you are doing it wrong
[06:26:14] <reloadz> hmmmm
[06:26:33] <Pnoexz> reloadz: $() returns an object with the elements that match your criteria
[06:26:45] <jaffipaffi> Pnoexz: Thanks...  This works as I wanted: http://jsfiddle.net/kNvyF/2/ wasn't that difficult
[06:26:51] <Pnoexz> its not used to know if an element is visible or not
[06:27:12] <reloadz> how do i do it right... so i can know if it is visible or not
[06:27:14] <reloadz> ?
[06:27:30] <Kambfhase> you have to check if the jQuery collection contains an element.
[06:27:54] <Kambfhase> reloadz: http://jsfiddle.net/wNBpd/4/ << the way to go
[06:28:52] <reloadz> but if i delete style display: none it dosent alert anything now
[06:29:49] <AdamPDotty> how should the length be > 1?
[06:29:59] <Pnoexz> reloadz: of course it doesnt
[06:30:52] <reloadz> but how then i can ditermine if it is visible or not? :D
[06:31:02] <AdamPDotty> reloadz: try with >0
[06:31:22] <reloadz> thx
[06:31:22] <AdamPDotty> or drop that part
[06:31:25] <Kambfhase> sorry, my bad
[06:31:29] <reloadz> thz
[06:31:34] <Pnoexz> if it doesnt exist, you cant see if its visible or not
[06:32:03] <Anticom> thank you Kambfhase
[06:32:09] <Kambfhase> np
[06:32:30] <Anticom> but why isn't .each() method able to do that?
[06:32:36] <Anticom> i don't get the difference
[06:33:51] <AdamPDotty> If I knew how to do a fiddle with a third party adding iframes ..
[06:43:20] <nitrix> /Remove classes background{*}
[06:43:22] <nitrix> $j('.questions').attr('class',function(i, c){
[06:43:24] <nitrix>     return (c.match (/\bbackground\S+/g) || []).join(' ');
[06:43:26] <nitrix> });
[06:43:28] <nitrix> How do I do the opposite ?
[06:43:56] <nitrix> I want my regex to grab the classes NOT starting with "background" instead.
[06:44:52] <nitrix> I think I posted before joining the channel completely. I can re-explain my problem.
[06:45:53] <AdamPDotty> !c.match
[06:48:49] <Trisox> back :)
[06:48:56] <Trisox> Cork: any luck ?
[06:52:18] <xec_> AdamPDotty: .match() doesn't return a boolean, it returns an array of matches
[06:53:28] <dorgan> anyone run in to this?  In IE8, IE8 standards mode.  I am getting errors from jQuery of Object doesn't support this property or method, and it has to do with Element.prototype.__defineSetter_("innerHTML".......
[06:55:05] <dorgan> and this happens while jQuery is loading
[06:57:10] <xec_> nitrix: i'm not sure if/how regex is able to do that (easily). maybe you're better off looping through and checking each word instead
[06:58:03] <dorgan> wow sorry i posted the wrong error
[07:01:44] <dorgan> ok so while jquery is loading I am getting:  Object doesn't support this property or method on something that looks like this:  if((f=o.leftMatch[h].exec(a))!=null&&f[2])
[07:03:37] <lathan> dorgan, seperate it out into its basic logical components, and see which one causes the error
[07:03:44] <lathan> dorgan, does it work fine after jQuery has loaded?
[07:03:57] <rns> is there a way to apply this function to multiple classes (in addition to just 'auto')? http://jsfiddle.net/rPztv/
[07:04:00] <lathan> dorgan, are any of those variables supposed to be a jQuery object?
[07:04:24] <lathan> rns, make sure to select jQuery on the Framework sidebar....
[07:04:46] <lathan> rns, you mean like input.auto, input.otherClass
[07:04:55] <lathan> rns, or $('input').filter('.auto, otherClass')
[07:05:15] <rns> yes input.auto and input.otherClass
[07:05:28] <lathan> ?multiple selector @ rns
[07:05:28] <bot-t> rns, Multiple Selector (selector1, selector2, selectorN) - Selects the combined results of all the specified selectors. http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[07:05:34] <lathan> the comma
[07:05:57] <lathan> rns, I did the filter in order to "lock" in the input select, so i could just use the comma on the classes
[07:05:57] <rns> lathan, so I could just do this? http://jsfiddle.net/rPztv/2/
[07:06:16] <lathan> rns, all in the same string
[07:06:29] <lathan> http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rPztv/3/\
[07:06:31] <lathan> http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/rPztv/3/
[07:06:42] <lathan> $('input.auto, input.otherClass')
[07:07:03] <rns> lathan, ah I see.  So filter just reduces the number of times I have to type input?
[07:07:09] <lathan> yes
[07:07:12] <rns> cool
[07:07:14] <rns> thanks!
[07:07:21] <lathan> rns, make sure you know the difference between filter and find
[07:07:30] <rns> lathan, what's the difference?
[07:07:50] <lathan> find looks at what you selected, and all their descendents
[07:07:50] <AdamPDotty> children
[07:07:51] <rns> the underlying algorithm?
[07:08:16] <lathan> $('div').filter('.class') says div.class
[07:08:28] <lathan> $('div').find('.class') says anything .class that is inside a div
[07:08:44] <rns> oh interesting
[07:08:48] <lathan> so div > span > a.class matches with find
[07:08:52] <rns> I can see how that could become troublesome
[07:09:04] <lathan> rns, find is like doing .children() and .children().children() and ....... forever
[07:09:11] <lathan> rns, and helpful
[07:09:19] <lathan> rns, if you understand it
[07:11:32] <xec_> nitrix: this is slightly ugly code but maybe you understand what i was thinking; http://jsfiddle.net/hAmfW/
[07:11:54] <nitrix> It's fine. We're in a hurry and done something ugly here as well ;)
[07:12:03] <nitrix> Whatever works, launch date is today :D
[07:12:05] <nitrix> 4pm ^^
[07:12:25] <xec_> it's 4:12pm here
[07:12:35] <xec_> so YOURE FUCKED
[07:12:36] <xec_> ;D
[07:12:45] <xec_> hehe, good luck mate

[07:14:14] <lathan> shame...all the cool stuff doesn't work in IE....
[07:14:22] <xec_> lathan: yeah i know right. fucking IE
[07:14:35] <xec_> and look at that shim o.O
[07:14:39] <lathan> no, saying it works in IE10 doesn't make me happy
[07:15:12] <xec_> at least it's slightly better than not at all. in about 5-10 years from now
[07:15:18] <lathan> lol
[07:15:18] <lathan> yah
[07:16:16] <xec_> nitrix: btw, that check matches if the word *contains* background - not if it *starts* with it - i'm not sure what you wanted?
[07:17:54] <xec_> nitrix: you can just check explicitly for 0 if that's what you need
[07:21:12] <lathan> nitrix, here's a version using jquery grep and a regular expression: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/7bzaJ/1/

[07:34:32] <seutje> or make the children call e.stopPropagation
[07:34:46] <Trisox> i asked it and i was like  :| doh
[07:34:49] <dsfasdf> sry that i´m gettin in the conversation but i´ve jquery ui 1.9... and the accordion. The problem is when the accordion gets bigger its getting out of range of the page size, what can i do
[07:34:55] <lathan> Trisox, fiddle?
[07:35:00] <Trisox> ?
[07:35:07] <lathan> oh, you have it...nvmind
[07:35:10] <Trisox> wy it works like a charm :D
[07:35:14] <lathan> lol
[07:35:15] <seutje> I think he wants to fondle
[07:35:23] <Trisox> when i asked the question i was like DOH!
[07:35:40] <lathan> dsfasdf, you are wanting to constrain the total height of the accordion to the page height?
[07:35:57] <dsfasdf> lathan: yes thats right
[07:36:38] <lathan> dsfasdf, have you tried heightStyle: fill, see ?accordion #fillspace
[07:36:38] <dsfasdf> lathan: no, i want to constraint the total height of the page to the accordion
[07:36:42] <bot-t> dsfasdf, UI/API/1.8/Accordion - jQuery Wiki - Make the selected elements Accordion widgets. Semantic requirements: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Accordion

[07:46:49] <NielsNL> hello all, i have an issue with the "resizeable" widget and clearing the content inside the tag using: .html()
[07:46:52] <NielsNL> http://jsfiddle.net/AGLRF/
[07:46:54] <T0nttu> am I supposed to see an alert when opening or closing an accordion with this option set: change: function(event, ui) {alert('buu');}
[07:47:06] <NielsNL> can someone tell me how i can fix this?
[07:49:04] <NodeX> no
[07:51:10] <dsfasdf> lathan: the page size must be updated dynamically to the accordion, is that possible
[07:58:09] <dsfasdf> is that possible to dynamically update the page size to a accoridon
[07:58:13] <dsfasdf> accordion
[08:01:51] <lathan> dsfasdf, can you create a jsfiddle example for me?
[08:02:48] <T0nttu> my problem is perhaps similar to dsfasdf's http://forum.jquery.com/topic/triggering-other-events-with-accordion-open-close
[08:03:33] <NielsNL> How do i know of .resizable() need to be destroyed?
[08:04:32] <dsfasdf> lathan:  ok one sec
[08:05:26] <dsfasdf> lathan: shall i paste you the url of the live page
[08:06:11] <lathan> dsfasdf, add these resources:
[08:06:11] <lathan> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[08:06:11] <lathan> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.1/jquery-ui.js
[08:06:23] <lathan> dsfasdf, I would prefer a fiddle, because then I can tinker with it and try changes
[08:06:47] <dsfasdf> lathan:  kk
[08:06:50] <lathan> dsfasdf, have you tried heightStyle: "content" ?
[08:08:40] <NielsNL> please help, how can i know or which widget is added to a tag?
[08:10:47] <bingobongo> hey guys did you noticed about the jquery project will be closed in 31 december 2012? :(
[08:11:04] <ajpiano> bingobongo: what
[08:11:10] <bingobongo> yep damn :(
[08:11:15] <ajpiano> what are you talking about
[08:11:22] <bingobongo> it is safe resource googling
[08:11:24] <bingobongo> +damn
[08:11:24] <clocKwize> Hey guys, what is the most reliable way to track every click on a page? e.g. If the user clicks on a button that has javascript behind it, that then stops it bubbling, I still want to know about it
[08:11:39] <ajpiano> what is safe resource googling
[08:11:52] <lathan> clocKwize, that's a difficult question
[08:11:56] <bingobongo> i red about jquery project it will be closed in 31 dec 2012
[08:12:00] <bingobongo> ajpiano:
[08:12:03] <bingobongo> damn
[08:12:09] <ajpiano> bingobongo: the jQuery Foundation is not "closing"
[08:12:15] <bingobongo> sure?
[08:12:19] <lathan> bingobongo, don't believe everything you read
[08:12:22] <bingobongo> do some googling :(
[08:12:32] <bingobongo> nope it was jhon resig too in the article
[08:12:34] <bingobongo> interview
[08:12:40] <bingobongo> don't remember the link
[08:12:41] <bingobongo> sorry
[08:12:48] <ajpiano> bingobongo: i'm on the board of directors of the jquery foundation, and i just finished giving a talk about the state of jquery at a conference 5 minutes ago
[08:12:51] <bingobongo> bad thing
[08:12:56] <lathan> lol
[08:13:01] <ajpiano> nothing is "closing" on december 31st
[08:13:20] <bingobongo> ahahah i was joking
[08:13:26] <lathan> troll....
[08:13:26] <ajpiano> i figured as much
[08:13:31] <bingobongo> so i founded out one of the fundation great :D
[08:13:49] <lathan> bingobongo, what's more fun is when me and ajpiano get racing to answer questions :)
[08:14:00] <lathan> we usually answer with a couple of seconds
[08:14:07] <bingobongo> ehehe
[08:14:13] <bingobongo> great !!
[08:14:41] <NielsNL> please help, how can i know of a widget is added to a tag?
[08:14:42] <bingobongo> sometimes i like to make this stupid jokes, last time i entered the codeigniter channel with the nick MArk_Z
[08:14:43] <ajpiano> it's all you lathan today, i'm about to go AFK, i may or may not have slept last night
[08:14:57] <bingobongo> everyone tought i was mark zuckenberg
[08:15:13] <clocKwize> lathan, thats what I guessed...
[08:18:01] <NodeX> in a codeignitor channel - I highly doubt that
[08:18:04] <bingobongo> ajpiano: so jhon didn't noticed you before the today conference?
[08:18:05] <bingobongo> lathan: jhon told me you will stop working on jquery you will pass on microsoft ASP.Damn
[08:18:07] <NodeX> codeignitor blows
[08:18:23] <ajpiano> bingobongo: please don't troll the channel, we all have better things to deal with
[08:18:33] <bingobongo> ehehe ok
[08:18:52] <lathan> clocKwize, it depends on how willing you are to extend jQuery
[08:18:58] <bingobongo> NodeX: "codeignitor" ?
[08:19:11] <lathan> clocKwize, do you control all the other click handlers?
[08:19:18] <clocKwize> lathan, yes
[08:19:30] <clocKwize> well, except those in highcharts
[08:19:32] <lathan> could you make them trigger a click_disabled event?
[08:19:36] <clocKwize> but thats ok
[08:19:45] <NodeX> bingobongo : when you can spell "John" talk to me about spelling
[08:20:05] <clocKwize> lathan, I guess..
[08:20:08] <clocKwize> just seems a bit messy
[08:20:17] <bingobongo> NodeX: ok when you can spell "codeigniter" talk to me about spelling :D
[08:20:32] <lathan> so if the local .click(..... $(this).trigger('click_disabled'); e.stoppropagation() )
[08:20:38] <NodeX> die
[08:20:54] <lathan> clocKwize, its either that or bind to a click to every object
[08:20:55] <bingobongo> poor
[08:20:57] <bingobongo> bye guys
[08:21:14] <lathan> clocKwize, or extend jQuery and write your own injection into all the click handlers
[08:21:27] <lathan> (if you can put that code ahead of the local handlers)
[08:21:28] <clocKwize> lathan, ok.. thought that might be it :) Maybe i'll extend stoppropagation ...
[08:21:56] <lathan> clocKwize, that should work....just have it trigger a click_disabled if the event stopped is click
[08:22:09] <clocKwize> yeah
[08:22:10] <clocKwize> thanks..
[08:22:48] <lathan> ?src preventDefault

[08:24:28] <lathan> this isn't: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8/jquery.js
[08:24:37] <lathan> search for Event.prototype
[08:24:49] <dsfasdf> lathan: where do i have to add heightstyle attribute
[08:25:14] <lathan> dsfasdf, see the demo: http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#no-auto-height
[08:25:28] <lathan> ?rtm
[08:25:32] <bot-t> lathan, #12343 (event.pageX and pageY have incorrect values in IE10 on ... - Opened 3 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12343
[08:25:36] <lathan> lol
[08:25:49] <lathan> ?rtfm
[08:25:49] <bot-t> http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page is your friend
[08:25:59] <lathan> and so is jqueryui.com/demos/
[08:26:36] <clocKwize> maybe I'll just track mouse move instead
[08:26:55] <lathan> bot-t: ui-man is http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[08:26:55] <bot-t> lathan, Stored "ui-man".
[08:27:01] <lathan> ?ui-man @ dsfasdf
[08:27:01] <bot-t> dsfasdf, http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[08:28:42] <HyShai> I have a few images with the same class, how can I wait for all of them to load? I need to get height().....
[08:29:10] <HyShai> each().on("load",.....)?
[08:30:23] <lathan> HyShai, that has fun things...with cross browsers, the caching and other things
[08:30:26] <lathan> HyShai, try this plugin: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[08:30:36] <lathan> ?p imagesLoaded
[08:30:36] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:30:38] <lathan> oopa
[08:31:08] <dsfasdf> lathan: ok now it fills the content of the accordion, but not the page size, i paste the code in fidle, just 1 sec
[08:31:27] <HyShai> lathan: i know...my idea doesnt work on IE...thx for the plugin tip
[08:34:00] <dsfasdf> lathan: its a little complicated cause its a aspx site
[08:34:29] <lathan> dsfasdf, the idea is to make a simple snapshot of the output html
[08:34:31] <lathan> verry simple
[08:34:52] <lathan> just grab the javascript that makes the accordion, and the actual accordion html and stick them in
[08:34:59] <lathan> (and make sure it still runs)
[08:35:03] <T0nttu> does the jquery ui accordion change event fire after the accordion has opened or closed? so we can measure the effects on the layout the change had?
[08:35:19] <lathan> then your solution can be found in the simple environment and put into your production version
[08:35:53] <lathan> T0nttu, the events in UI changed between 1.8 and 1.9
[08:36:14] <lathan> in 1.9, the docs say the event "activate" is called when a new one is opened
[08:36:16] <T0nttu> yes, but I'm using 1.8 - I know change changed to activate
[08:36:26] <lathan> ?tias
[08:36:27] <bot-t> Try It And See
[08:36:43] <T0nttu> but the thing is just that: I can't see any alerts I test
[08:36:57] <lathan> T0nttu, make a small test case (perhaps on fiddle) and console.log it
[08:37:13] <lathan> T0nttu, then can you give me that fiddle/example ?
[08:37:53] <T0nttu> if I have this in the options, it doesn't alert me change: function(event, ui) {alert('buu');} ok I'll try fiddle, maybe it's cleaner to start from scratch.. working on final polishes on a retrofit responsive design on a site I didn't build myself originally
[08:38:22] <lathan> T0nttu, often simplifying the main code helps you find the bug
[08:40:15] <lunks_> Hi, where can I submit an issue? Github doesn't seem the place to do it. This crashes on IE: http://jsfiddle.net/hqjfv/1/
[08:41:23] <dsfasdf> lathan: here the fiddle code: http://jsfiddle.net/cERry/
[08:41:25] <ajpiano> lunks_: http://bugs.jquery.com for bugs on core
[08:42:46] <lunks_> ajpiano: thanks! i'll check with latest jquery version first and then report it if it's still there.
[08:43:28] <lathan> dsfasdf, I don't mean to be mean, but is that your definition of simple?
[08:43:48] <daniel_b> I just discovered Deferreds. They're awesome! My average function size and indendation have both shrunk. :)
[08:44:07] <lathan> daniel_b, good. I suppose I should use those too......
[08:44:16] <daniel_b> Try it, you'll like it. :)
[08:44:37] <lathan> dsfasdf, can you clear out the IE comments and the VB/ascx control tags from the html?
[08:44:48] <lathan> dsfasdf, set the framework to jquery....
[08:45:06] <dsfasdf> lathan: ok 1 sec
[08:45:07] <lathan> dsfasdf, and jsfiddle adds the html and body tags for you
[08:47:16] <lunks_> ajpiano: done! http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12896 thank you very much!
[08:48:28] <lathan> lunks_, why are you putting a (functino(){..})() call in a fiddle?
[08:48:38] <clocKwize> lathan, https://gist.github.com/4073246 < This is where I am currently - it works well, except the stop propagation stuff causes weird side effects (clicking off a twitter bootstrap drop down menu doesn't close it..)
[08:48:55] <clocKwize> but I can't see why what I have done is any different than calling stopPropagation directly (except it tracks it too)
[08:49:32] <dsfasdf> lathan: see again
[08:49:32] <lunks_> lathan: I'm just pasting the code which crashes my app, but I can happily remove it.
[08:49:36] <lathan> lunks_, it doesn't crash my IE
[08:49:45] <lathan> IE9
[08:49:48] <lunks_> lathan: ie8?
[08:49:53] <lathan> no...9
[08:49:55] <lunks_> Bug is in IE8
[08:49:58] <lathan> okay
[08:50:01] <lunks_> and apparently 7 too
[08:50:18] <lunks_> but I haven't confirmed it yet
[08:50:35] <clocKwize> oh, I'll get on to this tomorrow, I've got to go home.. thanks lathan
[08:51:16] <lathan> dsfasdf, if you don't hit update, I can't see it, and you need to give me the new url
[08:51:18] <clocKwize> why did I just get a notice from somiah saying don't say bullshit on #jquery please O.o
[08:51:52] <ciack404> Hi everyone
[08:52:07] <dsfasdf> http://jsfiddle.net/cERry/2/
[08:52:22] <lathan> clocKwize, if you didn't, then its probably a mistabbed username
[08:52:53] <dsfasdf> lathan: in pageContent is the page with the accordion
[08:53:06] <lathan> clocKwize, this github isn't in javascript? or its pseudocode?
[08:53:08] <ciack404> I'm having an issue with jquery mobile wrapped with phonegap. On android 4.0 header and footer flicker on changepage. Works smoothly on android 2.3
[08:54:32] <lathan> dsfasdf, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to wade through pages and pages of html in this fiddle, I want to see the  div that is the accordion and its children, nothing else, no <html>, not <body> no <%@ Master .... tags
[08:54:40] <lathan> and you need to put the framework to jQuery
[08:56:38] <lathan> dsfasdf, nvmind about the framework, I see you have script tags at the bottom, but they need to be real linkes...not relative links
[08:57:01] <lathan> dsfasdf, the idea is to show me just the accordion part of your site, and you should be able to demonstrate the problem on the jsfiddle
[09:00:17] <dsfasdf> lathan: to script links: the ui is running, no problem
[09:01:08] <dsfasdf> lathan: the problem is that the accordion is runnig in a .aspx site; and this .aspx is a part of a masterpage
[09:02:10] <dsfasdf> lathan: i´ve to change the div height in the materpage according to the size of the accordion in the aspx site, is that possible
[09:03:28] <T0nttu> lathan: I've created a fiddle for the accordion change event thing http://jsfiddle.net/seqKm/ This is coming from a Wordpress site, so I simplified it somewhat and I hope it's readable
[09:03:36] <dsfasdf> the aspx is running in the pageContent on masterpage, there you can see the height of the div, and other divs around filled with images
[09:03:37] <lathan> dsfasdf, I'm not understanding
[09:03:49] <lathan> so asp is setting a manual height?
[09:04:06] <T0nttu> lathan: the change event alert is near the bottom of the js
[09:06:46] <lathan> T0nttu, I believe accordion needs to be run on more than just the h6's
[09:07:01] <lathan> T0nttu, accordion needs to run on the container div
[09:07:39] <lathan> wait...what? wierd
[09:07:48] <lathan> are you making your own accordion @ T0nttu ?
[09:08:36] <T0nttu> I have no idea, I'm using code not originally written by me
[09:09:16] <T0nttu> it uses a $.widget
[09:09:17] <aqeel> hi room
[09:09:59] <lathan> T0nttu, I'm getting discouraged to spend my time working on it, when it seems like you are giving up because you didn't write the code
[09:10:05] <lathan> ?hi
[09:10:05] <bot-t> lathan, :)
[09:10:48] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/rTUdj/
[09:10:51] <T0nttu> lathan: I'm not giving up, please see this thread, I've been working on this problem for nearly 3 weeks (on and off) http://forum.jquery.com/topic/triggering-other-events-with-accordion-open-close
[09:10:58] <aqeel> aler() not working what am i doing wrong
[09:13:25] <NoiseEee> aqeel: the window.load function fires once, don't expect it to fire again after you assign a click handler
[09:14:25] <T0nttu> lathan: it's ok if you stop looking at it, at least you gave me the incentive to create the fiddle and now I can post it to the thread
[09:14:26] <aqeel> well after click it must fir once...as content get loaded it alert
[09:14:40] <aqeel> but i never get the alert
[09:14:44] <lathan> T0nttu, I'm looking at it
[09:16:05] <NoiseEee> you just said 'as content get loaded it alert'  so which is it, it does alert or it doesn't aqeel?
[09:16:48] <aqeel> i mean as content gets loaded it must alert, but i never recieve the alert
[09:16:51] <harami> hello, I am trying to add a class to a div, if there is no images in one particular div, its basically a slider which i want to hide if there is no images in it. This is the code I am using, but it doesn't work...pastebin.com/vYsHznXr
[09:17:58] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:18:11] <NoiseEee> aqeel: no, it does not alert.
[09:18:15] <NoiseEee> aqeel: the window.load function fires once, don't expect it to fire again after you assign a click handler
[09:19:08] <aqeel> so what am i doing wrong, it must alert as contents get loaded
[09:19:29] <jomofcw> Is there a way to detect on the page load if the cursor is already "hover" an element ? i.e. I have a menu with submenu that appear on the hover event, when the visitor click on the menu item it reload the page and then, when the page is reload it display again the submenu because the mouse still be hover the item : I want to avoid this.
[09:20:34] <NoiseEee> just put alert after loadrepo() aqeel ?  its not going to fire until loadrepo() ends
[09:21:46] <ciack404> I'm having an issue with jquery mobile wrapped with phonegap. On android 4.0 header and footer flicker on changepage. Works smoothly on android 2.3. Anyone experienced something similar?
[09:22:37] <aqeel> ??
[09:22:48] <aqeel> but how will i know if window is loaded
[09:23:13] <aqeel> if i only put the alert?
[09:23:50] <NoiseEee> what window? why are you assigning jQuery(window).load() in the callback for body.on.click after a certain condition is matched?
[09:23:55] <NoiseEee> what exactly are you trying to do ?
[09:24:01] <lathan> T0nttu, here's your issue
[09:24:12] <lathan> T0nttu, this code is re-creating the whole accordion code
[09:24:28] <ciack404> aqueel are you using .bind('mouseover'...  or .live('mouseover'...? Or .mouseover(...)
[09:24:46] <lathan> T0nttu, you aren't touching the regular ui.accorion commands, and therefore aren't getting the ui accordion events
[09:25:17] <T0nttu> thanks lathan
[09:25:41] <aqeel> i have a spinner and i want it to remove() after window load
[09:26:45] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/rTUdj/1/
[09:26:48] <jomofcw> Is there a way to detect on the page load if the cursor is already "hover" an element ? i.e. I have a menu with submenu that appear on the hover event, when the visitor click on the menu item it reload the page and then, when the page is reload it display again the submenu because the mouse still be hover the item : I want to avoid this.
[09:27:37] <lathan> T0nttu, I added this.options('change').apply() to the open and close
[09:27:39] <lathan> http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/seqKm/1/
[09:27:58] <lathan> T0nttu, you will need to set this up better if you want the event data...you will have to add it to the apply(...) call
[09:28:46] <T0nttu> lathan: I don't need the event data.. this is great!
[09:29:18] <lathan> T0nttu, okay...and for any other requests you have: make sure you state that you are doing a custom accordion
[09:29:59] <lathan> jomofcw, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8981463/detect-if-hovering-over-element-with-jquery
[09:30:18] <lathan> jomofcw, might not work in IE6
[09:31:41] <NoiseEee> aqeel: the place you've chosen to put your window load callback makes absolutely no sense.  move it somewhere logical. if you don't know where that is, you need to learn more about javascript and jquery before writing more scripts.
[09:31:45] <aqeel> NoiseEee: any thought
[09:32:03] <jomofcw> lathan hello and thanks I just give it a look. And in fact I don't support IE6.
[09:32:18] <T0nttu> lathan: I assure you this will be the last one :) and I know my "I have no idea" might have made me sound like a dick, but I'm not a parasitic person.. for proof you can see my posts, nearly 200, helping others on the CSS3Pie forum http://css3pie.com/forum/
[09:33:08] <lathan> T0nttu, I know others work can be daunting
[09:33:33] <lathan> T0nttu, just make the effor to discuss and ask questions about what is there
[09:35:20] <jomofcw> lathan it doesn't work in my case sadely :/. In fact it seems that on page load the element isn't already "hover". I test it doing a $element.filter(':hover').length and it always return me 0.
[09:42:12] <harami> how can i check if a div has images ?
[09:42:19] <harami> will it be in document ready function of load
[09:42:46] <jomofcw> Hm I think what i'm trying to do si not possible in fact :x
[09:43:48] <NoiseEee> harami: i guess you could use .children() or .find() with the appropriate selector
[09:45:27] <dblosevn> harami: in doument.ready youll be able to test if a div has images, in document.load they will actually be downloaded
[09:46:22] <jamey-uk> Does anyone in here have any experience with jQuery-File-Upload? I'm stuck trying to integrate it when it comes to queuing files and triggering all the uploads.
[09:46:49] <Verdyr> was hanging around here few days back, discussing an issue with ajax parsing issue when GET json stream from Jersey based REST endpoint.
[09:47:37] <dblosevn> jamey-uk: there are hundreds of jQuery-File-Upload plugins which one are you using?
[09:48:21] <jamey-uk> dblosevn: the one that is literally spelt like that, verbatim (https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload).
[09:48:55] <Verdyr> now thinking if I should file a ticket against query 1.7.1 version
[09:50:35] <Verdyr> any further advice?
[09:51:41] <dblosevn> Verdyr: that was a fragment of a question, and no possible was to answer that
[09:51:44] <kennen> Hi, i have some problems while using the jquery tabs. I want an onklick event if the user klicks on a tab but i dont know how to do that :( can some help me? Thats my code: http://pastebin.com/xtZeCJFr
[09:52:00] <dblosevn> jamey-uk: what problems are you having with it?
[09:53:01] <dblosevn> kennen: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-activate
[09:54:49] <jamey-uk> dblosevn: I've got it so you can drag files, it creates a queue and displays a thumbnail for each image. There's a start button which should fire all of the uploads off, the way I was doing it worked but was clearly a hack. Am trying to understand the 'correct' way of doing it; there are so many layers that just using the fully blown demo is too complicated, hence starting from the provided core and building up.
[09:55:22] <kennen> Hi <dblosevn>, Yea i found this too, but i dont know how to deal with this... I never used events in jquery bevore... f
[09:56:41] <dblosevn> kennen: $('selector').tabs({activate: function(event, ui) { your click code });
[09:57:20] <dblosevn> kennen: where 'selector' is your selector for the element your attaching the tbs plugin too
[09:57:30] <dblosevn> *abs
[09:57:33] <dblosevn> **tabs
[09:57:35] <dblosevn> wow
[09:58:59] <kennen> <dblosevn> Thank you a lot! Is it posible to get the id or some of the element the user clicked on? Because i want start an ajaxrequest to load the content of the tabs...

[10:00:08] <dblosevn> kennen: i cant remember exactly how but the answer is in the ui argument, set a breakpoint in the activate callback and look at the ui local var and you will find the solution
[10:01:00] <kennen> <dblosevn> yea ok i will keep my eys open :-) thanks
[10:01:18] <dblosevn> kennen: well that would be a start lol

[10:07:14] <jamey-uk> dblosevn: yeah sorry, I completely understand, just incredibly frustrated with this and the time it would take me to share the code would probably be better spent reworking the provided demo with built-in UI stuff.
[10:14:15] <Aero`> Hi :)
[10:14:28] <Aero`> Does anyone here knows jQuery Nanoscroller ?
[10:14:37] <Aero`> I can't get it to work -_-'
[10:14:50] <Aero`> it's a scrollbar replacement jquery script
[10:15:37] <dblosevn> ?demo @Aero
[10:15:37] <bot-t> Aero, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:15:51] <JLT> when you scroll to the bottom of the page, it has some ajax processing. I display a loading circle at the start of the event call, and hide it at the end. Now, between the showing and the hiding ... as the loading circle gets showed, an extra 32px of scroll can be made, so you scroll down that extra 32px and it'll call the scroll event again.
[10:16:05] <JLT> Is there a way to allow only allow the scroll event to trigger one at a time, but I don't want it chained.
[10:16:17] <JLT> I want all other scroll events called at the time one is already running - to be ignored.
[10:16:28] <JLT> I can do a variable method, set it to true/false depending and do a condition, but is there another way?

[10:17:18] <Aero`> @dblosevn : http://beta.aerodream-fr.net/index.php?page=intro
[10:17:34] <Aero`> I guess there's a CSS-related problem
[10:17:37] <Aero`> but I can't figure it out
[10:20:56] <Aero`> I have three <div>, container, nano, and subcontainer
[10:21:03] <Aero`> nano is used for the scrollbars
[10:21:16] <Aero`> container is the container class from Twitter bootstrap
[10:21:34] <Aero`> and subcontainer is a custom class that adds 20px padding on the sides
[10:21:56] <Aero`> for some reason i could not add this padding on the container class and had to create a subcontainer
[10:22:10] <kennen> I have some question again with the tabs^^ If i creat an tab and put a div container with id="123" in the tab. i cant change the Text (innerHTML) of this div? But y? i i move the div into the body it works wounderful. but in the tab, no way?
[10:22:14] <Aero`> @dblosevn : http://beta.aerodream-fr.net/index.php?page=intro
[10:25:18] <dblosevn> Aero: i would try scrolling the container that is actually tall enough to scroll ...
[10:25:37] <dblosevn> Aero: I would scroll the inner container
[10:26:40] <dblosevn> Aero: unrelared to that though theres an exception being thrown I can track down, your using both the minified version of jquery and nano
[10:27:08] <dblosevn> Aero: just about impossible to debug using minified code
[10:27:12] <Aero`> yup I seen that :(
[10:27:19] <microhxo> Guys, i am trying to match a value in a select list to text and then select that value.   I cant get a running fiddle because im using .net code with it but here: http://jsfiddle.net/KkgV9/1/  What i want that code to do is Search all of the select list VALUES for the text i provide, if there is a match, select that one.
[10:27:20] <Aero`> but no chance on tracking this one on my side also
[10:27:25] <dblosevn> *cant
[10:27:43] <Aero`> Thanks for the help :) I'll try to track down that exception and look at the div pb
[10:28:55] <anew> i am using a jq image hover, but if the image is big it runs off the bottom of the page - any ideas how to fix this ?
[10:29:56] <dblosevn> microhxo: whats wrong with that?
[10:30:24] <dblosevn> oh duh
[10:30:40] <dblosevn> your eaching the selects not the options
[10:31:00] <dblosevn> select#TimeZoneId option
[10:31:12] <dblosevn> and select is overkill id's are meant to only be used once
[10:32:03] <dblosevn> @microxho
[10:32:03] <microhxo> Ahh
[10:33:50] <dblosevn> microhxo: you also might want to clear the selected flag on all options before the each statment
[10:34:24] <dblosevn> $('TimeZoneId option').prop('selected', false); for example
[10:34:44] <dblosevn> #TimeZoneId
[10:35:43] <dblosevn> otherwise more then one will be selected and unless multi is turned on the one thats the farthest down the list that selected will be the one sent to the server
[10:45:42] <guy> https://static.anuary.com/2b434282-3a46-5a76-9acc-0dbaa93c1d1c/public/js/jquery.ay-circus.js children.wrapAll(wrapper); wrapper doesn't refer to the actual element
[10:45:46] <guy> why is that
[10:49:02] <dblosevn> guy: for one this is not an array... var container		= $(this[i]);
[10:49:11] <guy> It is.
[10:50:07] <dblosevn> guy: I would do container.wrapInner(wrapper)
[10:50:33] <dblosevn> unless your truly trying to wrap each child with wrapper
[10:50:55] <guy> uh. you are right. wrapInner is a better option. I have overlooked it.
[10:51:37] <dblosevn> and to answer your question wrapper is a Jqobj not a dom element
[10:51:49] <dblosevn> it has a reference to a dom elemnt within it though
[10:52:08] <dblosevn> wrapper.get(0) will give you the actual dom element
[10:53:04] <dblosevn> no need though as you can pass either a dom element or a jQobj into any jquery method that accepts a dom element
[10:53:04] <Danielpk> How i can add some data to form before send it? any idea?
[10:53:41] <guy> huh
[10:53:42] <guy> https://static.anuary.com/2b434282-3a46-5a76-9acc-0dbaa93c1d1c/public/js/jquery.ay-circus.js
[10:53:44] <guy> still no reference
[10:54:03] <guy> wrapper.remove(); should remove the .wrapper and its childern form the DOM
[10:54:33] <dblosevn> DanielPk: $('form#formname').sunmit(function () { $(this).append('<input type="hidden" name="fieldname" value="value" />'); return true; });
[10:55:04] <Danielpk> dblosevn: i already doing it, i bought there could have best way ;D

[10:55:59] <dblosevn> no wrapper.remove will remove the wrapper element that doesnt exist in the dom anyways
[10:56:18] <dblosevn> you never actually append that node your just cloning it with wrap
[10:56:42] <dblosevn> now $('.wrapper').remove however will work
[10:56:49] <gamingdroid> I have a form data, I'm converting to json. However, newlines in my text area field is breaking the json. Any suggestions?
[10:57:13] <guy> dblosevn: well, that's essentially my question. Why is it cloned, rather than actually used.
[10:58:17] <dblosevn> @guy im not that guy lmao
[10:58:40] <guy> what?
[10:58:49] <guy> oh
[10:59:50] <dblosevn> most likely the way that jquery actually does the wrap doesnt support keeping a reference to the element
[11:00:19] <dblosevn> although... maybe wrapper = container.wrapInner(wrapper); would work
[11:01:19] <brend_> need a beer
[11:01:38] <dblosevn> @me 2

[11:11:00] <dblosevn> brend_: i dont see any way to remove a row, wheres the button?
[11:11:12] <brend_> look at the end
[11:11:16] <brend_> dblosevn:
[11:11:30] <dblosevn> brend_: worked for me
[11:11:54] <dblosevn> except...
[11:11:58] <brend_> dblosevn: try to add a new one now
[11:12:09] <dblosevn> it removes the last row instead of the row you clicked on
[11:12:33] <brend_> dblosevn:  right
[11:12:54] <dblosevn> so if i click delete on the first row the last row is deleted
[11:13:31] <brend_> dblosevn:  after u remove the last one u are not able to add new ones
[11:13:44] <brend_> thats what im trying to fix
[11:14:00] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/4XZMb/914/
[11:14:16] <dblosevn> that deletes the row you actually clicked delete on
[11:14:20] <Caelum> I do a .click() on a select list that loads options via .load(), but then I want to pre-select a value, but the options haven't loaded yet when I call val(), is there a way to click() and supply a function to call for when it's done with its onclick?
[11:14:55] <brend_> dblosevn:  not working for me
[11:15:01] <dblosevn> works for me
[11:15:03] <dblosevn> add a row
[11:15:09] <dblosevn> type some text in the top row
[11:15:14] <dblosevn> click delete on the top row
[11:15:22] <dblosevn> top row is gone blank row is left
[11:16:10] <Caelum> can you have multiple onclick handlers?
[11:16:22] <dblosevn> brend_: weird i swear it just worked for me...
[11:16:27] <brend_> dblosevn:  but if i choose to delete any of the ones i have created i cant
[11:17:13] <dblosevn> ya it only works once...
[11:19:13] <codeDonkey> Can someone take a look at: http://jsfiddle.net/ct7Vy/1/  ... notice how the 'rows' variable is declared. This is working great. It finds the first table row that has 'MAT' in it, and the removes those rows and does some logic. BUT, I want it to find the table header row containing 'MAT MAthematics', and then start two rows below that, similar to the first commented line. Just can't get the right syntax.
[11:19:25] <fonko> guys could it  be possible that $('#soemthing).css(property); wont work in internet explorer?

[11:25:26] <dblosevn> brend_: http://jsfiddle.net/4XZMb/917/
[11:25:57] <dblosevn> brend_: you cant use an id for the delete button... ids are meant to be used once,
[11:26:16] <dblosevn> brend_: you were only binding the first button
[11:26:24] <brend_> dblosevn:  i didnt realize.. u are the hombre
[11:26:48] <dblosevn> brend_: I also added a conditional to stop you from deleting the last row
[11:27:30] <brend_> im testing out
[11:28:25] <dblosevn> brend_: http://jsfiddle.net/4XZMb/918/ actually even better I made it clear the last row instead of deleting it
[11:29:19] <dblosevn> brend_: because by your design it breaks if you delete all the rows, theres no way to add a new row if there isnt a minimum of one row in the table
[11:29:57] <brend_> dblosevn:  right.. this works better.. what i was wondering is..
[11:31:06] * hlve dances

[11:57:36] <jax> can you have multiple $(document).ready(function(){ ?
[11:57:56] <Iszak> yes.
[11:59:01] <jax> how do i search for #gah in #guh ?
[11:59:08] <jax> '#gah #guh' ?
[11:59:14] <jax> uh other way
[11:59:25] <fonko> dblosevn, thanks
[11:59:46] <NoiseEee> jax: don't bother searching within it; there's only one #gah in your document right?
[11:59:54] <Iszak> jax I'm not sure I understand
[12:00:01] <jax> ah yes. sorry
[12:00:11] <jax> NoiseEee: is right. some framework just created two of the same
[12:00:17] <NoiseEee> # is for grabbing an element by ID, and you know there's only one, so just var gah = $('#gah')
[12:00:27] <NoiseEee> two of the same ids, good luck!
[12:00:41] <jax> yeah i just had two forms and they both have an id field
[12:00:45] <jax> uh an email field
[12:00:52] <jax> and the framework generating the forms named them the same
[12:00:53] <jax> my bad
[12:01:05] <NoiseEee> well maybe i'd try grabbing them by name and referencing the 2nd one or something
[12:01:21] <jax> how can i grab the first input of a named (id) form?
[12:01:23] <NoiseEee> $('[name="emailField"]')
[12:01:39] <NoiseEee> $('#form input').first()
[12:02:25] <Lexflex3000> can anyone read me?
[12:02:45] <NoiseEee> 10-4 Lexflex3000
[12:03:01] <Lexflex3000> 10-4?
[12:03:10] <hlve> Lexflex3000, it means yes.)
[12:03:41] <Lexflex3000> ok cool
[12:03:51] <Lexflex3000> i rembmer noiseeee
[12:04:03] <Lexflex3000> u helped me out once like half a year ago :)
[12:05:21] <jax> is this ok? $('#participate-form').find('[name="email"]').focus();
[12:06:20] <MistuhKurtz> Anybody have experience with techniques to improve animation of large images?
[12:06:22] <warrenparsons> jax: Should be. If you know the target will always be an input, input[name="email"] would be marginally faster.
[12:06:39] <jax> thx
[12:07:59] <warrenparsons> jax: Further, I think $('#participate-form input[name="email"]) would be even better. From what I understand, nowadays .find() is only faster if you're looking within an already existent jQuery object.
[12:07:59] <TheFuzzball> Why is a jQuery object not an instance of Array?
[12:08:12] <jwmann> Is it possible to add a timer or delay to the :hover effect of an element?
[12:08:34] <jwmann> TheFuzzball: Because objects and array aren't the same?
[12:09:08] <MistuhKurtz> jwmann, check out the hoverIntent plugin
[12:09:31] <jwmann> MistuhKurtz: Checkin it out now
[12:09:31] <MistuhKurtz> be advised that it must have both hoverIn and hoverOut functions defined, can't just pass 1 like with jquery's native hover()
[12:09:38] <MistuhKurtz> but it's pretty sweet.
[12:09:46] <TheFuzzball> jwmann I'll explain myself better. Say you do: $(".foo"); jQuery might return: [{WrappedHTMLElement},{WrappedHTMLElement}, ...]
[12:10:48] <hugo_moss> hey, im trying to extend jquery with a function called disableTextSelect that i found on the net, the pastebin is: http://pastebin.com/KqjyRQ5G  for some reason it says there is no f unction called disableTextSelect, can someone please tell me why
[12:11:00] <TheFuzzball> Yet, Object.prototype.toString.call($result) !== "[Object Array]" and $result instanceof Array is false.
[12:12:57] <hugo_moss> anyone with any ideas plz
[12:13:35] <jwmann> MistuhKurtz: This seems pretty kool, but the I'm not sure how to implement it with a fully CSS hover enabled navigation.
[12:14:05] <MistuhKurtz> what were you trying to do jwmann ?
[12:14:12] <jax> thx warrenparsons
[12:14:21] <TheFuzzball> jwmann Just to help you not look so arrogant and ignorant in future, it's because jQuery's selector delegates to document.querySelectorAll, which returns a pseudo-array, which jQuery then extends.
[12:14:27] <jax> how could i find the first <div that has class="control-group error"
[12:14:49] <jwmann> TheFuzzball: Thanks!
[12:15:41] <hugo_moss> http://pastebin.com/KqjyRQ5G  for some reason it says there is no f unction called disableTextSelect, can someone please tell me why
[12:16:14] <jwmann> MistuhKurtz: Basically, I have a sub-sub-menu that breaks usability when trying to reach other items in my sub-menu. If you'd like an example. I can give you access to the website in a PM.
[12:16:22] <NoiseEee> jax: $('.control-group.error');
[12:16:44] <jax> duh
[12:16:49] <MistuhKurtz> sure jwmann let's have a quick look..
[12:19:36] <jax> will this find the first input within a <div class="control-group error" ? find('.control-group.error').first().find('input');
[12:20:17] <NoiseEee> jax: tias?
[12:20:32] <NoiseEee> jax: there's something called jsfiddle.com, give er a go
[12:20:56] <hlve> jsfiddle.net
[12:26:39] <jax> how do i check if a search returned anything?
[12:26:57] <jax> .length i suppose?
[12:27:24] <TelFiRE> you can just be like if(var)
[12:27:31] <TelFiRE> if it's empty, it'll be false, otherwise true
[12:28:01] <dabear> TelFiRE: nope
[12:28:16] <dabear> an empty jquery object is truthy, not falsey
[12:28:18] <TelFiRE> ...
[12:28:22] <dabear> so gotta check length
[12:28:58] <TelFiRE> well idk. it has worked for me.
[12:30:34] <dabear> sorry, but no, it cannot have.
[12:30:51] <dabear> not for results returned by the jquery constructor anyways
[12:31:36] <hugo_moss> http://pastebin.com/KqjyRQ5G  for some reason it says there is no f unction called disableTextSelect, can someone please tell me why
[12:31:47] <TelFiRE> I guess it was a true/false var
[12:32:21] <Xtrivity> Hey guys. Right now I am using: $("#container").animate({'left': -960 * slidenum[1]}, 'slow'); to get from one slide to another. I want it to start on slide 3... If i change slidenum[1] to 3, then I have the issue of it on loading scrolling quickly.. I dont want to be able to see that. What's a solution for that?
[12:32:50] <TelFiRE> hugo_moss: If it's the same thing I'm thinking of, it would be disableSelection(); -- that's part of jQuery UI
[12:32:57] <dabear> hugo_moss: no idea, it is defined there at least. see ?demo
[12:32:57] <bot-t> hugo_moss, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:33:58] <TelFiRE> oh sorry I didnt even look at code, I see you make your own function. This is cool -- if you get it working I hope you release it. I had to load JQ UI just for that on my last project.
[12:33:59] <dabear> Xtrivity: set the initial left property before doing the animation, see ?css
[12:33:59] <bot-t> Xtrivity, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[12:34:24] <dabear> I mean, see ?css(..,..)
[12:34:24] <bot-t> .css(propertyName, value): Set one or more CSS properties for the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/#css2
[12:35:28] <Xtrivity> dabear: i'm not sure how to positions the css. it's in a #container { width: 4880px; position:relative } .slider { width:960px; float:left }. I'm not using absolutely values. i'm using floats
[12:36:19] <dabear> Xtrivity: you can use the same values for css() as for animate()
[12:37:49] <Xtrivity> ahh dabear: I was forgetting to make it a negative value.
[12:37:50] <Xtrivity> Thank you!
[12:38:40] <_zoggy_> hmm jquery website still says 1.8.2. blog is at 1.8.3 though
[12:40:29] <rabbite> is it possible to use a wildcard in a jQuery .remove call?
[12:41:00] <rabbite> i want to remove any elements with id's that match "___plusone_*" where * == a number
[12:41:40] <maasha> so I have this drop down menu. its fired by onchange, but how to make it change to the default on load? http://jsfiddle.net/U9NV3/7/
[12:43:50] <hugo_moss> dabear: hold on let me get it live
[12:44:58] <maasha> so I need the onload eventhandler to trigger onchange for #taxMenu
[12:46:04] <hugo_moss> dabear: http://edtcorp.net16.net
[12:46:21] <hugo_moss> its not going to show anything because it fails at the call for disableSelectText()
[12:46:57] <hugo_moss> disableTextSelect i mean
[12:49:00] <hugo_moss> dabear: you still there
[12:50:36] <maasha> Can I get the onload handler to fire a onchange?
[12:57:49] <jwmann> I forgot what $('foo'), $('bar').dostuff(); does.
[12:58:09] <jwmann> Or maybe I wrote that wrong..
[12:59:42] <maasha> So how can I get the drop down default to actually be the default? http://jsfiddle.net/U9NV3/7/
[13:02:46] <hugo_moss> ok dabear, i have conflicting jquery libraries
[13:02:57] <hugo_moss> i have one jquery1.4.2
[13:03:04] <hugo_moss> and a jqueryjcarousel library
[13:03:08] <hugo_moss> how can i fix that?
[13:03:19] <hugo_moss> i removed the jquery jcarousel, and the line of code worked
[13:03:36] <hugo_moss> i looked into it about noConflict, but i tried different ways and still got the error
[13:08:11] <Jon47> i can't believe how often this comes up
[13:08:16] <Jon47> just stop including more than one jquery!!!
[13:09:47] <gadlol> Hello.. Can anyone help? How can i remove a class from table row children (tds) ?
[13:09:54] <hugo_moss> jon, the problem is, he added his own jquery functions and extended it
[13:10:00] <hugo_moss> so i need both libraries
[13:10:08] <hugo_moss> well
[13:10:08] <hugo_moss> hold on
[13:13:04] <wroathe> gadlol: $('tr').children().removeClass('the-class');
[13:14:24] <gadlol> thanxx a lot wroathe
[13:14:45] <hugo_moss> yeah theres some functions that i need in both libraries
[13:15:12] <hugo_moss> and it looks like the jcarousel libary adds some parts of the jquery library
[13:15:20] <hugo_moss> honestly i dont know, but the libraries are conflicting
[13:20:48] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: Are you saying that your copy of core jQuery 1.4.2 contains customizations that you need?
[13:23:29] <hugo_moss> yea
[13:23:46] <hugo_moss> how can i fix that
[13:24:23] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: The way you *should* fix it is by pulling those customizations out and adding them to your own code, so that you're no longer stuck with an increasingly outdated version of jQuery.
[13:24:58] <hugo_moss> what about noConflict
[13:25:52] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: noConflict is intended to let you use jQuery with other libraries that make use of things like the $ variable name. Its purpose isn't to spackle over ill-considered modifications to a copy of the core library.
[13:26:18] <hugo_moss> i didnt make any customizations to the jquery library
[13:26:25] <hugo_moss> i have two libraries, jquery and jcarousel
[13:26:33] <hugo_moss> and they are conflicting with each other
[13:26:56] <Pilate> no they arent
[13:27:53] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: I'm pretty sure jCarousel isn't conflicting with jQuery. Though I generally prefer jCarousel Lite (by a different author), jCarousel is a solid plugin.
[13:28:14] <hugo_moss> ok
[13:28:19] <hugo_moss> well right
[13:28:22] <hugo_moss> im confused
[13:28:27] <hugo_moss> i added a function
[13:28:38] <hugo_moss> and it adds a function to jquery
[13:28:52] <hugo_moss> and thats where the problem happens
[13:29:18] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: How does it add this function?
[13:29:29] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: Is it a plugin?
[13:30:26] <hugo_moss> nah
[13:30:31] <hugo_moss> just some code that i found
[13:30:34] <hugo_moss> im new to javascript
[13:30:43] <hugo_moss> and i dont know exactly what its doing
[13:30:54] <hugo_moss> but it adds a function to the global jquery object
[13:30:58] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: Okay. Sorry, I'm coming in a little bit late to this.
[13:31:04] <hugo_moss> heres the code:
[13:31:34] <hugo_moss> http://pastebin.com/KqjyRQ5G
[13:31:49] <hugo_moss> hold on it expired
[13:32:27] <hugo_moss> http://pastebin.com/g0eELMFJ
[13:32:43] <hugo_moss> im adding that code, and it says theres no such method
[13:32:53] <hugo_moss> when i take out jcarousel, it works
[13:35:35] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: Are you doing this so that when the user clicks carousel controls, the carousel items don't get a selection overlay?
[13:37:17] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: This thread also seems to indicate that jCarousel has that functionality built in, which could explain the conflict you're seeing - http://www.pagelines.com/forum/topic/7730-why-disable-text-select-plugin-in-carousel-jcarousel-js/
[13:40:04] <hugo_moss> hmm yea
[13:40:06] <hugo_moss> thank you
[13:40:37] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: Sure thing. If possible, I'd recommend updating to jQuery 1.8 as well. There have been A LOT of really nice changes and updates added since 1.4.2
[13:40:39] <jwmann> If I use .find() will if find elements recursively? If so, how do I prevent that?
[13:40:52] <NoiseEee> jwmann: find elements recursively?
[13:41:11] <warrenparsons> jwmann: As in find elements in children, grandchildren, etc?
[13:41:22] <jwmann> warrenparsons: Yes
[13:41:46] <hugo_moss> ok thanks warren
[13:41:47] <jwmann> I have menu and sub menus and sub-sub menus
[13:41:56] <warrenparsons> jwmann: Just build your selector to get what you want. $('.parent').find('> .child') would only find immediate children.
[13:41:57] <NoiseEee> jwmann: use children() to limit to single level
[13:42:07] <warrenparsons> jwmann: Or do what NoiseEee said ;)
[13:42:36] <jwmann> Is children() the same as child()?
[13:43:26] <warrenparsons> jwmann: I don't think there is a .child() in jQuery
[13:43:31] <jwmann> Hmm
[13:43:39] <jwmann> Okay, I guess I am mistaken
[13:44:10] <hugo_moss> hmm thats weird, a search for disabletextselect is empty
[13:44:13] <warrenparsons> jwmann: But yeah, .children() only returns immediate children.
[13:44:45] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: In the jCarousel source?
[13:46:24] <hugo_moss> yea
[13:46:40] <hugo_moss> or anything with select or disable or mozilla or navigator
[13:47:10] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: jCarousel might (or should) not be using $.browser
[13:47:53] <hugo_moss> text has no results either
[13:49:38] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: What version of jCarousel are you using?
[13:50:28] <hugo_moss> Version 0.2.8 - 2011-04-14</h4>
[13:54:05] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: Yeah, I'm not seeing that functionality duplicated in the plugin's source code. Interesting.
[13:54:26] <brettster> hey guys. Im trying to show a div when the user hovers over a section in an li item. there are 4 sections / 4 divs that are suppose to pop up. the problem is they're not popping up individually on hover. all our popping up at the same time when i hover over the section
[13:54:27] <brettster> http://pastebin.com/kywtMgxd
[13:54:32] <brettster> theres my code.
[13:54:43] <warrenparsons> hugo_moss: Is the selection disabling code present specifically for your use of jCarousel?
[13:54:58] <hugo_moss> nope
[13:55:03] <hugo_moss> i found it as a plugin:
[13:55:06] <hugo_moss> http://code.jdempster.com/jQuery.DisableTextSelect/jquery.disable.text.select.js
[13:55:23] <Matrikular> good evening, could someone please give me a hint on how to change the index while leaving everything else as is in a "string" (input name attribute) like: jform[params][images][2][headline]
[13:56:57] <warrenparsons> brettster: This is probably what you're looking for http://pastebin.com/qiEa1ia6
[13:57:25] <warrenparsons> brettster: Sorry, wait one.
[13:58:03] <warrenparsons> brettster: Try this one http://pastebin.com/iaeiBfKQ
[13:58:51] <brettster> Hey Warren - that still seems to make all pop up.
[13:59:09] <brettster> i need one to pop up at a time depending on what li  I'm hovering on.
[13:59:25] <brettster> so if I'm hovering on li1 - show section.information that's contained in li1
[13:59:35] <brettster> same for li1 through li4
[14:01:00] <warrenparsons> brettster: Yeah, this might work better. http://pastebin.com/KXc9FC1b
[14:01:52] <brettster> ugh! nope...
[14:01:54] <brettster> haha
[14:02:01] <brettster> maybe it needs to be an array?
[14:02:03] <brettster> I'm not sure.
[14:02:06] <hugo_moss> i just looked through all the code but no cigar
[14:02:35] <warrenparsons> brettster: Okay, hang on. I hate pastebin…
[14:03:25] <warrenparsons> brettster: BTW, why the heck are you using section tags inside a ul?
[14:04:47] <brettster> it may not be the most semantic way of doing it - but it works in the long run. It's basically for boxes of services. Each box has a large image with a button on it - when the user hovers over the box - a box fades in that has some information
[14:04:58] <brettster> i could probably do this with a nested ul
[14:05:30] <DataLess> Looking for ideas for or against serializing JSON objects to store user preferences - anyone have experience with this?
[14:05:59] <Bakanek0> need your halp
[14:06:00] <Bakanek0> http://jsfiddle.net/ALcyq/17/
[14:06:15] <DataLess> Trying to get away from DB schemas and move towards a more "document" or JSON schema approach
[14:06:29] <Bakanek0> Cannot use prevent default action on added tab
[14:06:54] <DataLess> am concerned with evolving the objects however - older objects will be stored and need to be compared against new versions of that object
[14:07:07] <brettster> ahh
[14:07:09] <brettster> i fixed it
[14:07:14] <brettster> thanks warrenparsons
[14:07:15] <Bakanek0> DataLess: wut?
[14:07:30] <brettster> it should have been #maincolumn ul li instead of #maincolumn ul
[14:07:59] <DataLess> Bakanek0 - huh?
[14:08:19] <Bakanek0> DataLess: what are you trying to do?
[14:08:19] <warrenparsons> brettster: Give this a try. I'm not a fan of .hover() http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/5zVZF/
[14:09:01] <DataLess> persist a JSON object that will evolve
[14:09:16] <brettster> how come - just curious
[14:09:17] <DataLess> think more features being added -
[14:09:27] <DataLess> but want to store in MYSQL as a blob
[14:09:28] <warrenparsons> brettster: mouseenter/mouseleave is what .hover() uses internally anyway. Breaking it up this way makes it easier to understand and customize anyway.
[14:09:52] <dblosevn> DataLess: i do that all the time but I use Text same thing though
[14:10:00] <DataLess> persistence isnt the issue, it's creating a simple way to check if the old object has the values without breaking the app
[14:10:01] <dblosevn> I just write the whole json strct to mysql
[14:10:17] <DataLess> that's the easy part, dblosevn
[14:10:19] <dblosevn> only drawback is its not searchable
[14:10:32] <DataLess> the hard part is making the object evolve within the app
[14:10:56] <DataLess> old obj has property poop as a string
[14:11:06] <dblosevn> not really create an interface to the obj
[14:11:06] <DataLess> new obj has property poop with array elements
[14:11:22] <Bakanek0> dunno lol
[14:11:26] <dblosevn> when you make changes to abj it updates db,
[14:11:31] <dblosevn> *obj
[14:11:32] <DataLess> right
[14:11:33] <warrenparsons> brettster: here it is using .hover() http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/5zVZF/
[14:11:39] <DataLess> so interface to it
[14:11:47] <dblosevn> if a member doesnt exist set a default value
[14:11:53] <DataLess> or a "prototype" method
[14:11:59] <DataLess> that does some error checking?
[14:12:12] <dblosevn> well i do all that on the serverside
[14:12:31] <DataLess> like validate the JSON prior to push?
[14:12:34] <dblosevn> always send the latest version of the of the object to the browser
[14:12:56] <DataLess> IC so keep my object as a stdclass or something like that
[14:13:04] <DataLess> push to JS
[14:13:11] <dblosevn> no create an interface on the serverside to pull the json, and add a toJSON function that will build the obj out to the latest version
[14:13:13] <wroathe> Does jquery have a method to grab an object literal's keys?
[14:13:38] <dblosevn> so basically
[14:14:02] <dblosevn> give me a couple mins ill write you a skeleton
[14:14:22] <Bakanek0> http://jsfiddle.net/ALcyq/17/ halp
[14:14:22] <DataLess> thank you - i kind of see where you're going
[14:17:28] <Bakanek0> http://jsfiddle.net/ALcyq/17/
[14:17:30] <Bakanek0> SOS
[14:18:54] <DataLess> i'd really like to start using entire objects as payloads - I saw a YUI 2 json utility that looked close
[14:18:57] <DataLess> but overly complicated
[14:19:46] <Bakanek0> 0.1 BTC for solving this problem ! http://jsfiddle.net/ALcyq/17/ !!!111
[14:21:47] <Bakanek0> 0.15 BTC  for solving this problem ! http://jsfiddle.net/ALcyq/17/ ! Come on guys! you have the chance to win!
[14:23:15] <NoiseEee> stop spamming Bakanek0
[14:23:33] <NoiseEee> also a) learn how to use jsfiddle properly   b) state a problem?
[14:25:06] <Bakanek0> NoiseEee: preventDefault function doesn't work when I add new tab. Instead of that POST request is sent
[14:30:09] <dblosevn> DataLess: http://test.chosd.com/37
[14:31:48] <dblosevn> DataLess: oviously that can use some serious help I was just trying to get the interfacing concept out to you I wouldnt use that code in production as is but would make some changes on how the defaults are set etc, make validator plugins etc
[14:33:14] <DataLess> this is great dblosevn, i see it now - so then with every invocation - or user "touch" the object evolves itself
[14:33:53] <DataLess> can be interpreted by JS and acted upon - then saved
[14:33:54] <dblosevn> well the end user always has the most up to date version of the oject
[14:34:12] <dblosevn> the server ensures that as you would use the class to retrieve the json
[14:34:26] <dblosevn> and also to set the values
[14:34:42] <dblosevn> or get indivual keys
[14:35:27] <dblosevn> so say on a get request youd do $obj = new myobj($_GET['id']); echo $obj->toJSON();
[14:36:53] <dblosevn> on a post request youd do $obj = new myobj(null, json_decode($_GET['obj'])); $obj->update();
[14:37:21] <jwmann> I need a way to determine what level of a sub-menu I'm at assuming the standard ul>li>ul>li>ul>li format. Anybody know?
[14:37:55] <DataLess> yea, this is great, I was thinking before of creating the objects purely in JS - but makes more sense to have it originate from PHP
[14:38:16] <dblosevn> so basically the concept is to never play with the object directly on the server side let the class interface you to the object
[14:39:07] <dblosevn> that way even if the object in question is 6 mothns old an 10 versions ago it will always have all the members of the latest version of the object
[14:39:30] <dblosevn> and makes validation caake if you write some validator plugins
[14:39:46] <dblosevn> eg like boolean, string, phone, email etc
[14:40:50] <DataLess> so then you've been successful at having JS consume these - work in your app as features change
[14:41:40] <DataLess> this is a very interesting approach - i like it. thank you!
[14:42:53] <awc737> why is jquery database tables telling me it can't load this json because it's invalid: http://paste.laravel.com/aZg
[14:43:43] <dblosevn> DataLess: np
[14:45:11] <dblosevn> awc737: its valid, the plugin might not like the whitespace try removing it
[14:45:14] <Bakanek0> ok. I repaired my code by myself. so no one gets bitcoins
[14:45:19] <Bakanek0> xD
[14:45:45] <dblosevn> Bakanek0: was unaware you had a problem sorry :-( but its better you figured it out on you own give a mana fish...
[14:46:20] <awc737> same problem dblosevn , I'm following their example: http://datatables.net/examples/examples_support/json_source.txt
[14:46:35] <awc737> should it be utf08
[14:46:47] <dblosevn> awc737: usually always
[14:49:29] <awc737> what could be the problem
[14:49:42] <dblosevn> did you try utf-8
[14:50:28] <awc737> it is
[14:51:29] <dblosevn> awc737: http://jsfiddle.net/VpWep/
[14:52:56] <dblosevn> awc737: just for shits and giggles try http://paste.laravel.com/aZi
[14:54:30] <awc737> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/navN3/1/
[14:55:18] <dblosevn> awc737: that will never work
[14:55:40] <awc737> lol
[14:55:41] <awc737> why
[14:58:13] <awc737> ?
[15:03:11] <jwmann> Ugh
[15:03:33] <jwmann> I need a way to determine what level of a sub-menu I'm at assuming the standard ul>li>ul>li>ul>li format. Anybody know?
[15:04:37] <dblosevn> awc737: http://jsbin.com/ujalom/2/edit
[15:05:44] <jwmann> Is there a way to count how many element within a jQuery objecy?
[15:06:02] <jwmann> s/objecy/object
[15:06:25] <awc737> dblosevn: I don't see what you did different
[15:06:59] <dblosevn> yours violated cross domain browser security by attempting to pull a request from datatables.net
[15:07:17] <awc737> oh i see
[15:07:24] <awc737> except on my local server, I shouldn't be violating that request
[15:07:35] <dblosevn> depends lol
[15:07:50] <brend_> ate a good pizza
[15:07:57] <dblosevn> if you connected to 127.0.0.1 and pull a request from localhost it violates
[15:08:16] <dblosevn> or if your ajax service runs on a different port
[15:08:18] <awc737> someone had the exact same problem in stack overflow, and in the end said it was solved by an apache config
[15:08:21] <awc737> except didn't specify
[15:08:30] <dblosevn> well
[15:08:34] <awc737> I'm referencing it relatively
[15:08:53] <dblosevn> might want to see the application/json mime type in the request
[15:09:19] <dblosevn> header('Content-Type: application/json');
[15:09:21] <devone> if i have var foo=document.getElementById('bar') is there a way to feed that into jquery as `this`?
[15:09:27] <dblosevn> php by default sends text/html
[15:09:34] <brend_> dblosevn:  i found a little bug in the code u passed me
[15:09:56] <dblosevn> brend_: call the orkin man?
[15:10:03] <brend_> haha
[15:10:38] <brend_> i should
[15:10:39] <awc737> dblosevn: in the top of text file?
[15:11:00] <dblosevn> hmm so your linking a txt file?
[15:11:05] <dblosevn> not an ajax service
[15:11:07] <awc737> yeah, just like in your example
[15:11:30] <dblosevn> then it shouldnt be a mimetype problem
[15:11:47] <dblosevn> can i see an example of it not working?
[15:13:24] <dblosevn> awc737: http://jsbin.com/ujalom/3/edit

[15:15:27] <Caelum> how do you disable a form field? $('#field').attr('disabled', 1) ?
[15:15:35] <dblosevn> there you go again with your cross domainn request
[15:15:44] <awc737> hmm wtf! lol how did you get it
[15:15:49] <dblosevn> look at my last link
[15:16:25] <awc737> yeah but I'm requesting ../file
[15:16:27] <dblosevn> you realize your html has to have the same number of columns as your array has indexes right?
[15:16:59] <dblosevn> ok... here it is relative

[15:18:55] <inv> hi, I'm having some trouble hooking events. I want my callback to fire when something calls $('#content').html(something);
[15:18:55] <awc737> I put the array in HTMl commented... it has 2 columns also
[15:19:27] <inv> I thought $('#content').change(callback); should work, but it doesn't fire
[15:19:37] <inv> does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
[15:19:46] <Kevin-_-> Hello, I'm implementing a drag n drop function, where when I drag it to a place holder, it either updates or inserts into a database.  That part works, and I remove the placeholder when I insert in.
[15:19:59] <awc737> i think it must be apache config because my code looks identical to your working example dblosevn
[15:20:17] <Kevin-_-> Now, when I move it between different box's, and it's empty I try and put the placeholder back in, echoing back through the ajax call using this: echo "$(\"<li class=\"placeholder\"></li>\").text(\"Add your classes here\").appendTo(\"#$foo[0]\");";
[15:20:42] <Kevin-_-> And I can't seem to get it to add the placeholder back, is there a diff way I'm supposed to be doing that?
[15:21:27] <dblosevn> awc737: http://jsbin.com/ujalom/5/edit
[15:22:12] <awc737> :'( your working examples make me jealous

[15:24:05] <awc737> I am from URL jw.partners.dev/index.php/orders
[15:24:12] <bebe> good evening @ all from germany
[15:24:36] <devone> huhu
[15:25:04] <awc737> sorry my bad dblosevn , that is my URL browser, my variable is jw.partners.dev/sample_shipTo.txt
[15:25:30] <dblosevn> awc737: dont know what to tell you, so far i havent been able to break it... it just works
[15:26:00] <dblosevn> awc737: try putting http:// in front of the url
[15:26:06] <awc737> DataTables warning: JSON data from server could not be parsed. This is caused by a JSON formatting error.
[15:26:10] <awc737> yeah I tried both
[15:26:33] <dblosevn> try not includingit at all just /sample_shipTo.txt
[15:26:47] <dblosevn> also browse to the text file and make sure its being served
[15:27:06] <awc737> yeah I did all those
[15:27:25] <dblosevn> is the text file displaying in the browser?
[15:27:36] <bebe> I'm a very big fan and longterm developer with jquery/ui/mobile etc. Actually I have to check for the company I'm working at, which js framework is to use for a large business project
[15:27:57] <dblosevn> also earlier you said  I am from URL j[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[Cw.partners.dev/index.php/orders is all the unicode garbge maybe in the js file?
[15:28:23] <bebe> So I started search with an inner prefer of jquery (because I like it most)
[15:28:44] <bebe> and I found http://jsperf.com/dojo-vs-jquery-getelementbyid/28 which compares the performance
[15:28:45] <dblosevn> or worse in the txt file?
[15:29:32] <awc737> no I messed up typing
[15:29:38] <awc737> I think the problem may be a conflicting js file
[15:29:53] <bebe> Now there's my question if jquery 2 or later is going to get similar performance like ext

[15:30:01] <tds5016> hey. is there a way to set up notifications?
[15:30:01] <dblosevn> so noConflict jquery
[15:30:36] <tds5016> so that when I run an ajax query, I can run the same function that queried the function again?
[15:30:37] <dblosevn> http://jsbin.com/ujalom/6/edit
[15:30:51] <awc737> I do use noConflict
[15:31:14] <dblosevn> ... not quite ... $(document).read
[15:31:37] <brend_> jaja
[15:31:41] <tds5016> or is there a way to do something like a .on() a jquery object?
[15:31:54] <awc737> its jQuery in my script
[15:32:11] <brend_> dblosevn: why im not able to remove the first row?
[15:32:22] <zfly9> Hey guys how can I make it so a certain function only after a other function has finished loading?
[15:32:25] <dblosevn> link me again, closed that hours ago
[15:32:29] <dblosevn> @brend_
[15:32:34] <brend_> ok
[15:34:00] <dblosevn> awc737: could be include order
[15:34:20] <dblosevn> I usually include jquery first, imediately after noconflict then include the rest of my scripts

[15:35:43] <egoplant> What is the event bind for when the value changes on a text input?
[15:35:44] <dblosevn> brend_: i can remove whatever row I want to
[15:35:54] <brend_> dblosevn:  the first one
[15:36:01] <dblosevn> brend_: i can remove whatever row I want to
[15:36:03] <egoplant> 'value' doesn't trigger until you hit enter
[15:36:37] <brend_> dblosevn:  i mean by default u get the 1st row.. u cant remove that
[15:37:02] <bebe> change
[15:37:08] <dblosevn> brend_: i added 3 rows put a b c in the first column of each row then deleted the first i was left with 2 rows, b and c
[15:37:21] <dblosevn> your cant delete all the rows or you code breaks
[15:37:23] <dblosevn> *you
[15:37:55] <dblosevn> so i added a condition to disallow deletion of the last row and to unnstead default all the values
[15:38:02] <dblosevn> *instead
[15:38:03] <egoplant> Anyone?
[15:39:37] <dblosevn> brend_: but it seems you remvoed my code to default the values on last row removal
[15:40:22] <brend_> dblosevn:  so if i put <tr style="display: none;" wouldnt work?
[15:41:14] <brend_> i mean would work but im not going to be able to add rows
[15:42:40] <awc737> lol dblosevn thanks for so much of your time and help
[15:42:50] <dogarrhea> http://jsfiddle.net/JDAgp/5/  so i'm trying to figure out what a "race condition" is in javascript since javascript is not "multithreaded"
[15:43:02] <dogarrhea> it seemingly prints those numbers in sequence every single time
[15:43:14] <awc737> dblosevn: I updated it to use sample_shipTo.php instead of .txt, and generated that JSON, and it's working... http://paste.laravel.com/aZG
[15:43:36] <awc737> I never really figured out that problem, but that's alright I guess because it was a test and this is more like how it will be working anyway
[15:46:29] <dblosevn> awc737: :-)
[15:46:33] <dblosevn> brend_: http://jsfiddle.net/4XZMb/925/
[15:46:34] <zfly9> Hey guys how can I make it so a certain function only after a other function has finished loading?
[15:47:24] <dblosevn> brend_: no then youd be making new hidden rows lol the right way to do it would be to make a template row and make it hidden and use that row as a template for all the others then you could remove all rows
[15:48:03] <brend_> oh i see
[15:48:11] <brend_> dblosevn:  what have u changed there?
[15:48:23] <dblosevn> added the code back to clear the fields
[15:48:32] <dblosevn> on last row deletion
[15:49:56] <brend_> excelent
[15:50:00] <brend_> thanks man
[15:50:05] <brend_> now i have the heavy part
[15:50:11] <brend_> with php
[15:50:17] <dblosevn> ya you made it hard on yourself
[15:51:22] <dblosevn> i would have named the fields like fieldname[] instead of enumerating theme
[15:51:26] <dblosevn> *them
[15:51:34] <dblosevn> makes dealing with them later far easier
[15:52:41] <brend_> dblosevn:  so if i name the fields like that and i loop in the query should be working?
[15:53:20] <dblosevn> ya php will turn them into arrays
[15:53:36] <dblosevn> $_POST['fieldname'][0] would be row 1 fieldname
[15:55:35] <brend_> dblosevn:  i made this http://pastie.org/5379863
[15:56:51] <dblosevn> brend_: giberish to me as i dont know what the stmt  object looks like

[16:20:49] <bebe> is there someone who compares jquery with other libraries/frameworks with focus on performance?
[16:21:11] <brend_> stan_man_can:  you should use serialize()
[16:21:25] <bebe> for big webapplications (geographical calculations/rendering)
[16:22:03] <brend_> bebe: u mean like prototype ext2 etc?
[16:22:20] <bebe> yes as I asked before

[16:44:47] <awc737> alert( jQuery(this).next('input').prop('checked') )
[16:46:24] <Caelum> it's not .attr('checked') ?

[17:10:43] <jrockjiggz> how does parentsUntil() work?  if i'm embedded inside a table's <td>.. say a link inside a div.. i want to select the <tr> that is a 3 parents up.  i can use .parent().parent().parent()..  but shouldn't I be able to use .parentsUntil('tr') ?
[17:11:24] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: .closest('tr')
[17:11:43] <jrockjiggz> systemfault: is there risk of another TR being selected?
[17:11:56] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: No, it only goes up
[17:12:18] <systemfault> It's like doing .parent() until you reach the tr
[17:13:07] <jrockjiggz> great, it works, ty

[18:45:44] <aethero> That one doesn't work
[18:46:37] <jrockjiggz> aethero: because you have multple elements with the same ID. id must be unique
[18:47:00] <jrockjiggz> id should not start with a digit either
[18:47:44] <jrockjiggz> like so: http://jsfiddle.net/BcFVv/29/

[18:57:03] <Krinkle> At least not in Chrome
[18:57:17] <Krinkle> because your dropbox is on  HTTPS and jquery over HTTP
[18:57:26] <Krinkle> that's a security problem and chrome blocks it

[18:57:45] <aethero> Krinkle: Hope you dont mind, but PM/.
[18:58:14] <Krinkle> aethero: Use protocol-relative urls so you don't have to worry about this
[18:58:17] <Krinkle> google supports HTTPS
[18:58:23] <aethero> ok

[19:02:36] <aethero> Alright, done.
[19:02:45] <mike_papa> I get strange FF behavior. When i do inputForAnimation.animate({ backgroundColor : "white", borderColor : "rgb(204, 204, 204)"}, 500); it goes fine. But if I do inputForAnimation.animate({ backgroundColor : "white", borderColor : originalBorderColor}, 500);, where originalBorderColor = $(this).css("border-color") got before other animation and is basically "rgb(204, 204, 204)" i get TypeError: a.end is undefined. In Chrome it work
[19:02:45] <Krinkle> aethero: no, now the s is gone.
[19:02:47] <mike_papa> s ok. What's wrong?
[19:02:52] <Krinkle> aethero: ;-)
[19:03:05] <aethero> You just said

[19:03:39] <Krinkle> no just https
[19:03:41] <Krinkle>  //
[19:03:48] <Krinkle> aethero: For later reading, bookmark this: http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/

[19:03:54] <Krinkle> Yes
[19:04:00] <Alecoalec> And if anyone needs a hosted sample of this, pm me for a link.
[19:04:27] <aethero> Ok done, but what about the main issue?
[19:04:35] <Krinkle> aethero: Okay, so the second problem is the attribute
[19:04:53] <Krinkle> aethero: You're getting the value of the 'id' attribute, but your <a> inside <button> don't have any id=" attributes
[19:04:59] <Krinkle> so it is selecting an empty string, nada.
[19:05:10] <Krinkle> $("#pages div#" + id = '' + "")
[19:05:14] <Krinkle> that's what it does now
[19:06:04] <aethero> I dont really understand the basics of this. I dont really have the foundational knowlege needed to understand what you are telling me.
[19:06:20] <Krinkle> aethero: You are selecting "#buttons a"
[19:06:30] <Alecoalec> I promise mine only takes 3 minutes of someones time and 100% more interesting that aethero's project ;)
[19:06:33] <Krinkle> aethero: Which gives you a jQuery object for the three <a> on that page
[19:06:55] <Krinkle> aethero: Then you're calling click() which creates a click handler (do the function when clicking the link)
[19:07:17] <Krinkle> aethero: Inside that function you're referring to "this" which is the link the user clicked.
[19:07:56] <aethero> define "selecting". define "click()". define "click handler" define "object" :P
[19:07:58] <Krinkle> aethero: You are then retrieving the value of an "id" attribute (with .attr('id')), however that isn't working because there is no id attribute on the <a> links in the HTML, see?
[19:08:07] <aethero> ahhhh
[19:08:33] <aethero> <a href="#" id="1" class="mybutton myred">Div 1</a> <--- so what is "1"?
[19:09:20] <Krinkle> aethero: "selecting" is the calling $() with a CSS-like selector. Like "div", "#foo", "#foo div" etc.
[19:09:50] <Krinkle> aethero: There can only be 1 element with a given ID on the page
[19:09:57] <Krinkle> you can't have a button and a div with the same ID.
[19:10:05] <Krinkle> You're initial version with the data- attributes was good
[19:10:37] <Krinkle> Your*
[19:10:47] <Alecoalec> :(

[19:10:52] <Alecoalec> :)
[19:13:11] <aethero> Oh
[19:13:13] <aethero> So it is.
[19:13:18] <aethero> Excellent! Thank you!
[19:14:21] <aethero> I think before I dive into this more I need to dive into some basic education about this first.
[19:14:36] <aethero> I haven't so much as looked at this sort of thing before today.
[19:16:17] <Krinkle> aethero: .. and you added e.preventDefault(); I was just about to recommend that + show/hide()
[19:16:18] <Krinkle> nice
[19:17:22] <Krinkle> aethero: as a good habbit, you may want to avoid passing arbitrary strings to $(), instead use document.getElementById if you're certain it is an ID (which it is in this case)
[19:17:30] <Krinkle> also, you can use .not() to optimise this slightly
[19:17:45] <Krinkle> var $target = $(document.getElementById( id ) );
[19:17:56] <Krinkle> $("#pages div").not($target).hide();
[19:17:59] <Krinkle> $target.show()
[19:25:57] <Alecoalec> http://jsfiddle.net/Aleco/VJ6WJ/ Help me fix a simple jump after images are hidden/reappearing :)
[19:33:39] <Krinkle> Alecoalec: what's up?
[19:33:46] <Alecoalec> http://jsfiddle.net/Aleco/VJ6WJ/
[19:34:07] <Alecoalec> Click on the second or third images. Do you see how it jumps to the left hand side. Is there anyway I can animate that and not make it look choppy?
[19:35:06] <Alecoalec> When you exit the 512x512 the way the images come back is PERFECT. I just need it so when it slides to the left it actually slides rather than just jump.
[19:44:30] <Alecoalec> Krinkle: I got it. Thanks anyways!
[19:44:38] <Krinkle> great
[19:52:35] <Alecoalec> Actually Krinkle, I'm having conflict issues with prototype. I just added that one line not sure what happened
[19:52:38] <Alecoalec> http://pastebin.com/dUtvCfYL
[19:52:55] <Krinkle> please reproduce in jsfiddle.
[19:53:10] <Krinkle> Calling $.noConflict(); doesn't make sense
[19:53:15] <Krinkle> You mean jQuery.noConflict() ?
[19:53:23] <Krinkle> if the $ is the conflict ..
[19:54:20] <Alecoalec> fml shit was working fine 10 minutes ago... wtf happened
[19:54:33] <Alecoalec> I mean no $.noConflict(); always worked

[20:09:26] <birdbones> Is there a command in the webkit javascript repl to advance the debugger? Right now I have to keep clicking the "run" or "next" buttons and then refocusing on the input box.
[20:10:19] <eikonos> birdbones: in chrome, there should be a hotkey for that
[20:10:34] <birdbones> Thanks, just saw them in the hotkeys overlay.
[20:10:44] <eikonos> :)
[20:11:47] <birdbones> Oh lame, it focuses in the source code at the next debugger point, even if I was focused in the repl.
[20:12:12] <birdbones> Er, focuses the cursor.
[20:14:51] <ML74> I'm looking for a plugin that will allow me to add a colour overlay to an image on hover. The image has a transparent background, so I only want the overlay to appear on the solid bit. Anyone seen anything like this before?
[20:24:27] <Cork> ML74: wait, you want a image mask on the overlay??
[20:24:43] <ML74> Cork: I think so. Just wanna know if it's possible :/
[20:24:47] <Cork> ML74: thats simply not possible in html
[20:25:04] <Cork> well except loading all the images in js
[20:25:09] <Cork> and render it on a canvas
[20:25:32] <Cork> and use canvases instead of <img> or <object> tags
[20:26:02] <Cork> but you can't make a simple overlay that knows about pixel data in an image
[20:26:31] <Cork> js has to generate a new image with the overlay transcoded in the image data
[20:27:30] <ML74> Hmmmm.. might just use two images and a rollover lol
[20:27:57] <Cork> its prob you best bet ya
[20:28:16] <Cork> svg might be able to do it too
[20:28:46] <Cork> though not sure how feasible it is in practice
[20:31:44] <molavy> hi
[20:33:02] <molavy> i want extend jquery ajax that before submit get current submit button and disable it and after success or error re-enable it
[20:33:18] <molavy> how can i implement this
[20:33:35] <molavy> i try use ajaxform plugin with no success
[20:33:50] <molavy> any idea?
[20:35:46] <molavy> there is no idea?
[20:36:45] <Cork> molavy: that's not really doable unless you let ajax know what button is the "current"
[20:37:08] <Cork> molavy: simplest way to do that might even not need to extend ajax
[20:37:26] <Cork> ?.ajaxStart
[20:37:27] <bot-t> .ajaxStart(handler): Register a handler to be called when the first Ajax request begins. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[20:39:39] <Cork> .ajax is already VERY flexible, so you can do almost anything around it as is
[20:40:32] <molavy> all of problem is about passing current form to related ajax error or success
[20:41:11] <Cork> molavy: you could try context:
[20:41:14] <Cork> ?.ajax
[20:41:14] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:41:52] <Cork> not sure if thats accessible in ajaxStart though
[20:42:02] <molavy> i really know about this functions
[20:43:48] <molavy> my problem is that i want create custom jquery plugin that when a ajax start automatically disable related form and after success re-enable it and i don't know how should i implement this.
[20:44:06] <Cork> ajax can't really do it
[20:44:19] <Cork> cause it has no relation to dom
[20:44:24] <molavy> yes
[20:44:27] <molavy> so?
[20:44:42] <Cork> so you need to somehow give it the related element
[20:44:49] <Cork> ex. through context:
[20:45:02] <Cork> else it's not possible to do what you're asking for
[20:45:43] <molavy> what about wraper plugin around ajax
[20:45:48] <molavy> and use that plugin
[20:46:38] <molavy> i try change jquery ajax form plugin with no success
[20:47:02] <Cork> sure, you would still have to tell the wrapper about what element to have as the related element though
[20:48:02] <molavy> malsup.com/jquery/form/
[20:49:24] <molavy> Cork,how change above plugin in this case
[20:49:28] <molavy> ?
[20:53:16] <Alecoalec> Is there a way to run a function at a certain duration on a animate?
[20:53:37] <molavy> no idea?
[20:54:44] <Cork> Alecoalec: only way is the step callback
[20:55:15] <Cork> you would have to find the duration by the argument it returns to you
[20:56:02] <Alecoalec> so I do the step: function () { if( duration == 100 ) { myFunction();?
[20:56:10] <Alecoalec> or is step not a loop
[20:56:24] <Cork> its a loop
[20:56:29] <Cork> but you can't do it like that
[20:57:03] <Alecoalec> :(
[20:57:08] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/animate/#step
[20:57:16] <Alecoalec> One step ahead ;)
[20:57:45] <Cork> now will give you a time, and you would have to figure out how far from the start you want to trigger
[20:58:17] <Alecoalec> Cork, maybe there is an easier way.
[20:58:19] <Alecoalec> http://dope.com/magento/index.php/m-o-b-snapback.html
[20:58:27] <Alecoalec> Click on the second or third picture
[20:58:48] <Alecoalec> Once the image moves to the left, there is a TINY bit of a jump. Thats because of my onComplete I'm hiding the rest of the images
[20:59:45] <Cork> so you get margin collaps or what causes the jump?
[21:00:10] <Alecoalec> The Jump is caused because there is either one or two images that are being animated away
[21:00:23] <Alecoalec> and after that animate is complete I'm hiding it so it aligns to the left
[21:00:50] <Cork> ya, but thats cause something differ from the animated state to the hidden state
[21:01:48] <Alecoalec> I am calling the hidden after it's complete though so it wouldn't make sense.
[21:02:17] <Alecoalec> This is way betting than before but if you think there is some simple to do to change it then I'll go for it. If not whatever I can survive lol
[21:02:28] <Alecoalec> better*
[21:02:43] <Cork> what css value are you animating?
[21:02:50] <Alecoalec> Height Width Opacity
[21:03:16] <Cork> could you disable the hide for a little bit?
[21:03:31] <Alecoalec> http://jsfiddle.net/Aleco/VJ6WJ/3/
[21:03:36] <Alecoalec> That must help you a lot more ;)
[21:04:16] <Alecoalec> Woah thats weird!
[21:04:25] <Alecoalec> It's happening on the webpage but on JS fiddle it isnt
[21:04:38] <Cork> cause its a css rule that causes it
[21:05:14] <Alecoalec> I should probably position the img box to absolute?
[21:05:16] <Cork> .product-img-box img { padding: 0 10px 14px 0; } causes some of it
[21:05:16] <b-ot> Cork, definitely being used as one ;)
[21:05:31] <Cork> but theres still a pixel or more there
[21:05:40] <Cork> Alecoalec: not really
[21:05:53] <Cork> you sould just make sure to animate all values
[21:06:09] <Cork> Alecoalec: have you tried just using .hide('slow') or .hide(500); ?
[21:06:40] <Cork> Alecoalec: btw opacity doesn't go from 0 > 100
[21:06:53] <Cork> it goes from 0.0 > 1.0
[21:08:26] <Alecoalec> Check out the live site now
[21:08:29] <Cork> Alecoalec: the other problem comes from collapsing space
[21:08:31] <Alecoalec> I think that padding did the trick.
[21:08:45] <Cork> Alecoalec: there is one problem left
[21:08:51] <Alecoalec> What is it?
[21:09:09] <Cork> inline-block has significan spaces between them
[21:09:18] <Cork> so make sure you have no spaces between the img elements
[21:09:28] <Cork> (including line breaks)
[21:09:37] <Cork> or wrap those characters in <!-- -->
[21:09:53] <Alecoalec> I don't see any spaces between the img elements?
[21:09:55] <Cork> as in <img><!--   \n  --><img>
[21:10:04] <Cork> in the html
[21:10:15] <harami> hello, how can i check if a particular div has not images in it for example if div has no images then hide it
[21:10:17] <Cork> but let me check the new code first :)
[21:10:35] <Cork> Alecoalec: ya, its still there
[21:10:49] <Cork> Alecoalec: you can see it if you open the css for the first image
[21:10:56] <Cork> and toggle the display: none; value
[21:11:06] <Cork> if you check you'll see that the image jump
[21:11:44] <Cork> harami: you can but its has to do a quite expensive loop to do so
[21:12:23] <Cork> harami: $('div').filter(function() { return $(this).find('img').length < 1; }).hide();
[21:12:42] <Alecoalec> Wouldn't each work better?
[21:12:54] <Cork> thats even slower
[21:13:18] <Cork> or rather it would be about the same speed, but clunkier
[21:14:04] <Cork> harami: $('div').each(function() { if($(this).find('img').length > 0) { $(this).hide(); }; });
[21:14:37] <harami> ty cork will try it
[21:15:01] <Cork> harami: if possible its better to add a class to the div if you either have an image on it
[21:15:09] <Cork> or if there isn't one
[21:15:19] <Cork> and then build css rules based on that
[21:15:35] <Cork> you wouldn't even need js if you did that
[21:16:15] <Alecoalec> Cork: What should I take off from the first image in terms of styling?
[21:16:56] <Cork> nothing
[21:17:04] <harami> i have added a class to it
[21:17:10] <Cork> ah in the css editor in the browser
[21:17:16] <Cork> Alecoalec: the display: none value
[21:17:35] <Cork> harami: for with or without images?
[21:17:45] <Alecoalec> damn cork. two at once ahaha
[21:18:28] <Cork> Alecoalec: if you toggle display: none; on the 111 image
[21:18:36] <Cork> while 112 is expanded
[21:18:52] <Cork> you will see a shift of 112 a few pixels
[21:19:38] <Alecoalec> you have a damn good eyesite
[21:19:43] <Alecoalec> so I should take off inline-block?
[21:20:10] <harami> Cork: I used this code, but didnt work http://pastebin.com/xxPy7s0n
[21:20:25] <harami> Cork: i did at once got it to work but it was hiding all the divs containing images
[21:20:32] <harami> but it was yesterday not now
[21:20:56] <Changa> Hi, I am trying to replace an image after ajax returns me the new file name. I am trying to change the src of the image to the new filename, but old image disappears - new image wont appear - here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/3MBtQ/
[21:20:56] <luvmyh0nda> Hello, I am working on a schedule table. I have TR's, with TD's, and some of the TD's have a <div> which has positive Z-Index, and position absolute. I find that my DIV elements from TD's further down the table, are all floating to the left regardless of whether or not I have float:left set. Is there any way to stop the elements from stacking on top of eachother?
[21:21:02] <Alecoalec> woahwoah
[21:21:04] <Changa> well luvmyh0nda
[21:21:05] <Changa> xD
[21:21:17] <Cork> Alecoalec: no just add <!-- --> around the spaces and line breaks between the images
[21:22:05] <Changa> for the sake of seperating two questions I'll repost

[21:22:11] <Alecoalec> I see what you mean Cork, only problem is that my images are grabbed via PHP: http://pastebin.com/RG9JpPCN

[21:23:21] <luvmyh0nda> Changa, I'll take a shot at it.

[21:26:28] <MrPunkin> does getScript eval the external script within the context of what's calling it? Meaning can I assign 'this' to it or anything?
[21:26:53] <Cork> MrPunkin: no
[21:27:08] <Cork> that would causes quite nasty memory leaks
[21:27:16] <harami> http://pastebin.com/xxPy7s0n < cork didnt work
[21:27:42] <Cork> uh
[21:27:42] <MrPunkin> Cork: is there any way I can go about having my external script files reference stuff within my main script without resorting to global variables?
[21:28:02] <Cork> harami: ok it you want to run on a single element you don't need each or filter
[21:28:43] <harami> then what should i change it to
[21:28:48] <Cork> harami: if(jQuery('#slider img').length > 0) { jQuery('#slider-wrap').addclass('custom-blog'); jQuery('.slider-shadow').hide(); }
[21:29:22] <Cork> MrPunkin: i had to do that a while back :)
[21:29:45] <Cork> its a bit of a hack but you can make ajax return a function of what's in the js file
[21:29:50] <Cork> and let you pass arguments to it
[21:30:06] <MrPunkin> Cork: Can you show an example?
[21:32:32] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ZXCn3/
[21:32:47] <Cork> opps
[21:32:56] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ZXCn3/1/
[21:33:35] <Cork> its VERY important that createFunc is positioned so it doesn't inherit scopes
[21:33:56] <Cork> cause if you're unlucky that could mean that code never dies cause the scope chain keeps them alive
[21:35:02] <Cork> then you can do $.ajax(url, { converters: { 'text script': createFunc }, dataType: 'script' }).done(function(func) { func.call(this); });
[21:40:07] <MrPunkin> Cork: What do you mean to not inherit scopes? Sorry. Like don't write that function to inherit any of the scoping by doing something like .assign(this) on it or something?
[21:40:42] <Changa> Hi, I am trying to replace an image after ajax returns me the new file name. I am trying to change the src of the image to the new filename, but old image disappears - new image wont appear - here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/3MBtQ/ - live page is pass protected so PM me for details if you want to see it

[21:41:49] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: local is not defined
[21:42:00] <MrPunkin> Changa: You sure the SRC works from the page you are at?
[21:42:16] <MrPunkin> Changa: have you tried an absolute path instead of relative?
[21:42:49] <Cork> MrPunkin: hmm it might be a smaller problem then i thought
[21:43:24] <MrPunkin> Cork: my accessing of variables and methods within my plugin from external scripts? Or just protecting that function?
[21:43:25] <Changa> MrPunkin trying now
[21:43:28] <Cork> Function might not inherit scope apparently, and if so, theres no problem
[21:43:42] <Changa> the image works as loaded in the page updated src dont
[21:43:58] <Cork> MrPunkin: code is kept alive in js through reference
[21:44:19] <Cork> MrPunkin: as long as a variable has a reference into that scope the scope is kept alive
[21:45:03] <Changa> MrPunkin: no. absolute path didnt work either.
[21:45:42] <MrPunkin> Changa: have you tried simply doing $('img')[0].src = blahblah
[21:45:44] <harami> cork: i did that but there is an image in it which has no url only #, how to determine if the image url is not an image
[21:46:11] <MrPunkin> Changa: You have Chrome or anything that shows a console? It should tell you if it is loading the image resource or not
[21:46:27] <Cork> harami: # in an img src?
[21:46:28] <luvmyh0nda> MrPunkin it looks like its throwing a PHP error
[21:46:44] <Cork> harami: thats not valid; you shouldn't be generating that one at all
[21:47:17] <Changa> MrPunkin: I am using firebug. luvmyh0nda, the images upload and ajax returns the filename correctly.
[21:47:17] <harami> cork: its generated from nivo slider
[21:48:05] * Cork shivers
[21:48:23] <luvmyh0nda> Changa, the image itself is giving that error
[21:48:31] <luvmyh0nda> ./includes/image.php/image.jpg?width=625&height=200&cropratio=625:200&image=1352958470.png
[21:48:43] <luvmyh0nda> throws the malformed image path - no image data.
[21:48:53] <Cork> harami: if(jQuery('#slider img').filder(function() { return this.src !== '#'; }).length > 0) { jQuery('#slider-wrap').addclass('custom-blog'); jQuery('.slider-shadow').hide(); }
[21:49:07] <Cork> harami: but you need to verify that src actially is # in all browsers
[21:49:26] <Cork> not sure what they'll actually put there for such an url
[21:50:01] <Changa> luvmyh0nda: check now, I fixed the path but still no luck - thanks for that - slipped
[21:50:27] <Changa> ok it just worked.
[21:50:29] <Changa> ffs
[21:50:34] <Changa> 3 hours I missed that
[21:50:36] <Changa> -_-
[21:50:36] <luvmyh0nda> ;)
[21:50:49] <Changa> can't believe this shizzle
[21:50:54] <luvmyh0nda> at least yours had something actually wrong
[21:51:14] <luvmyh0nda> i've gone through a file for like 4 hours before, and couldn't figure it out, literally copied the contents of that file, into a new file, saved it and it works
[21:51:17] <luvmyh0nda> same path and everything.
[21:52:21] <Changa> WHY?
[21:52:23] <Changa> :)
[21:52:30] <Changa> life shocks me sometimes
[21:52:31] <luvmyh0nda> rogue bytecode?
[21:52:32] <luvmyh0nda> no idea
[21:53:07] <luvmyh0nda> Hello, I am working on a schedule table. I have TR's, with TD's, and some of the TD's have a <div> which has positive Z-Index, and position absolute.

Is there any way to stop the elements from stacking on top of eachother?
[21:54:55] <luvmyh0nda> $10 paypal
[21:57:45] <MrPunkin> Cork: The code you gave is throwing an error for me. Says unexpected ; on line immediately following but I can't find any malformation in the .ajax call
[22:02:18] <Alecoalec> Thanks Cork
[22:02:20] <Alecoalec> It worked
[22:02:46] <Cork> MrPunkin: pb
[22:02:53] <Cork> Alecoalec: np :)
[22:03:16] <MrPunkin> Cork: Nevermind… think I got it. So then with the code you gave do I need to assign a success handler on the ajax object or does it run the code already?
[22:03:30] <MrPunkin> Cork: I ask because no errors, but the code clearly isn't running as well.
[22:03:55] <Cork> no it doens't run it
[22:04:16] <Cork> i gave you an example of how to call it a bit back
[22:04:50] <MrPunkin> Cork: I see it now
[22:05:06] <Cork> uh, but its broken ;P
[22:05:12] <Cork> this will have the wrong scope there
[22:05:28] <Cork> you have to either pass context: this to .ajax
[22:05:32] <Cork> or save this in a variable
[22:05:58] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { context: this, converters: { 'text script': createFunc }, dataType: 'script' }).done(function(func) { func.call(this); });
[22:06:00] <Cork> should work
[22:07:24] <MrPunkin> thanks Cork
[22:07:26] <MrPunkin> I'll try
[22:08:28] <Cork> and you prob want to make a function that helps you do all this easier :)
[22:11:55] <MrPunkin> Cork: So within my jQuery plugin it seems that this is a reference to either window or the element that the plugin is run on. Is there no way to access the scope that holds all the variables within that plugin?
[22:12:22] <luvmyh0nda> Cork: any idea for my interesting quandry?
[22:12:26] <Cork> MrPunkin: no
[22:12:50] <Cork> MrPunkin: you need to provide the variable to use for reference, if its not accessable, its not.
[22:13:36] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: set position:relative on the td
[22:13:45] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: but not sure if that works in all browsers
[22:13:51] <MrPunkin> Cork: so within my plugin I set say 10 variables… then I want to set the scope / context as another variable that can be passed into this function. That's not possible though? I need to only reference a single variable and not my scope?
[22:14:08] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: you might actually have to wrap the content in an extra div with position: relative
[22:14:32] <Cork> MrPunkin: scope isn't a variable
[22:14:40] <Cork> so ya, you can't pass a scope
[22:15:02] <MrPunkin> Cork: Okay, so then no way to give access to my external script to all the local variables within my plugin
[22:15:05] <Cork> MrPunkin: simplest is to just add the variables you need as an object
[22:15:09] <harami> cork: i tried that too :( here is the url of the site http://198.58.86.52/~debz/test/
[22:15:21] <Cork> MrPunkin: there is, but not in the form of a scope
[22:15:51] <MrPunkin> Cork: but by assigning them into an object and passing them in I could, without that though I can't
[22:16:21] <Cork> harami: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <-- thats a BIG no no
[22:16:44] <Cork> that server isn't distributed, and you should never load jquery from there for a site
[22:16:55] <harami> how should i load jquery latest then
[22:17:06] <Cork> use one of the many cdn servers
[22:17:13] <Cork> its listed on the jquery download page
[22:17:48] <luvmyh0nda> Cork: no dice... 1sec
[22:17:53] <Cork> hmm
[22:18:11] <Cork> harami: actually, it looks like they've made it into a cdn now >_>
[22:18:19] <Cork> heh, they prob gave up XD
[22:18:27] <Cork> jQuery CDN Minified  <--
[22:18:29] <Cork> :)
[22:18:35] <Cork> harami: so scratch that comment
[22:18:42] <harami> ok i changed it to http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.min.js
[22:18:48] <harami> hope that is ok?
[22:19:00] <Cork> i don't think you have to anymore
[22:19:07] <harami> lol
[22:19:14] <Cork> code.jquery.com is cdn distributed now days
[22:19:20] <Cork> it wasn't a few months back
[22:19:23] <harami> yep
[22:19:25] <harami> it is
[22:19:38] <Cork> anyway back to the question
[22:19:41] <harami> i changed it to http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.min.js however now loading the latest minified version
[22:21:27] <harami> and now the latest full
[22:21:34] <harami> but that still doesn't work
[22:21:37] <Cork> harami: s/filder/filter/
[22:21:39] <Cork> :)
[22:21:54] <luvmyh0nda> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/RW4dU/
[22:21:56] <harami> whats that
[22:22:08] <harami> oh ok
[22:22:09] <harami> lol
[22:22:10] <Cork> harami: theres a typo in the line
[22:23:10] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: what is it you want me to do with that link?
[22:23:31] <luvmyh0nda> the 2 div's appearing on the schedule overlap
[22:23:36] <luvmyh0nda> is there any way to make them abut?
[22:24:46] <harami> ok changed it, still doesn't work hmm
[22:25:34] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: ya, thats one of the problems with tables
[22:25:50] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: though that said
[22:26:02] <Cork> if you use position: absolute the td can't ever know about its height
[22:26:21] <Cork> but you can add a parent div around the absolute positioned element and let it crop it to the height of the td
[22:26:35] <luvmyh0nda> the height is set the way I want it
[22:27:04] <luvmyh0nda> using jQuery, i get the height of the TD, before anything loads, send it back to the server, process how long 1 minute is in pixels, and send back my div w/ the height
[22:27:19] <luvmyh0nda> actually i send back a json array with the height, subject, etc
[22:27:30] <luvmyh0nda> i'm appending the DIV after the table loads
[22:33:02] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: you're prob better of not using a table if you want to use positioning
[22:33:11] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: they just don't mix well
[22:33:58] <Cork> the best i could to was make it crop it http://jsfiddle.net/RW4dU/3/
[22:34:03] <MrPunkin> Cork: Since I already have a built in method accessor on my plugin so I can call $obj.plugin(method, args) how dangerous is having a method called "access" that evals the arg and returns it within the running context of the plugin?
[22:34:17] <MrPunkin> believe me, I know eval is generally evil
[22:34:18] <MrPunkin> haha
[22:34:23] <harami> cork: so should i assume its impossible ?
[22:34:59] <Cork> MrPunkin: eval is not the way to go
[22:35:44] <Cork> harami: sorry it is possible, just got hung up on MrPunkin's problem
[22:35:46] <Cork> checking now
[22:36:04] <MrPunkin> Cork: I'm all ears for a better way… but I need some way to access those variables from external scripts without global functions or having to store them all in an object.
[22:37:03] <Cork> MrPunkin: like i said, store those varaibles in an objet
[22:37:08] <Cork> *object
[22:37:12] <Cork> and share the object
[22:38:29] <Cork> harami: heh, you're breaking my debugger XD
[22:38:44] <Cork> btw sorry it was luvmyh0nda's problem i meant not MrPunkin :)
[22:38:50] <harami> ?
[22:39:11] <Cork> Reload the page to get source for: http://198.58.86.52/~debz/test/ <-- thats all i get when i try to scroll your source in the debugger XD
[22:39:19] <Cork> never happend to me before
[22:39:35] <harami> reload now
[22:40:51] <Cork> harami: you're selector runs too early
[22:41:01] <Cork> you need to wait for the images to be added to the element
[22:41:11] <harami> hmm
[22:41:17] <harami> i have used document ready for that
[22:41:19] <Cork> .ready is before the script has run that adds the images
[22:41:29] <Cork> that only waits for the page to load
[22:41:32] <harami> .loaded?
[22:41:38] <Cork> as you add the images through js
[22:41:42] <Cork> you need to wait for that script
[22:42:30] <Cork> is nivoSlider the one adding the images?
[22:42:34] <harami> yep
[22:42:42] <Cork> see if it has a callback then
[22:43:57] <harami> thats what i am trying to figure out
[22:44:19] <Cork> ?g jquery nivoSlider

[22:45:05] <tw2113> sup cork -y
[22:47:28] <Cork> tw2113: the usual, thx for asking :)
[22:48:56] <tw2113> ;)
[22:49:00] <tw2113> someone has to care about you
[22:49:05] <Cork> lol
[22:49:21] <maasha> I have this dropdown menu with a set default option -> http://jsfiddle.net/U9NV3/7/ - but the defaults are not imposed on load. How can I do that?
[22:51:00] <Cork> maasha: you can fake a click on the select element
[22:51:30] <maasha> Cork: how?
[22:52:03] <Cork> $('#taxMenu').click()
[22:52:14] <Cork> you need to run it after all the needed rules has been applied though
[22:53:16] <maasha> Cork: click() it is? not change()?
[22:53:58] <Cork> or .change()
[22:54:12] <Cork> depends on what event listener you have it in
[22:54:25] <harami> window.load loads after document.ready is finished ?
[22:54:27] <maasha> Cork: the event listener is onchange
[22:54:35] <Cork> harami: yes
[22:54:57] <harami> cork: now i have loaded nivo in document ready, and that custom script in window load
[22:55:13] <Cork> that's racy
[22:55:23] <Cork> .load ever triggers before .ready
[22:55:36] <Cork> but nothing says whats run in .ready is done before .load runs
[22:55:47] <Cork> especially if its async (as all network calls are)
[22:55:51] <harami> so i should set an interval
[22:55:56] <harami> to window load
[22:55:57] <harami> ?
[22:55:59] <Cork> thats racy too
[22:56:07] <Cork> you need a callback for this to work
[22:56:21] <Cork> you need to be told from the plugin when its done
[22:56:49] <harami> afterLoad()
[22:57:59] <Cork> harami: novoSlider needs to provide a callback, like loaded: or callback: or complete: or ready:
[22:58:03] <Cork> harami: the dom can't help you
[22:59:12] <harami> Cork: check this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4728120/make-nivo-slider-fade-in-on-load
[22:59:59] <Cork> ya afterLoad could work
[23:00:40] <maasha> Cork: $('#taxMenu').change() - or .click() for that matter is not doing anything?
[23:01:35] <Cork> maasha: what filter are you trying to apply then?
[23:01:50] <harami> http://pastebin.com/x7F37tg4
[23:02:02] <Cork> maasha: ah, the + mark?
[23:02:20] <maasha> Cork: sorry, what do you mean?
[23:02:53] <maasha> Cork: not quite. the effect should be to collapse this tree (the + is secondary).
[23:05:03] <MrPunkin> Cork: Okay. Converted variables into 2 groups, elements: {} and settings: {} and then set a context with elements, settings, and methods to pass to your way of loading external scripts
[23:05:18] <MrPunkin> so external scripts have access to elements, settings and methods just as my plugin does
[23:06:22] <Cork> maasha: you mean something like http://jsfiddle.net/U9NV3/8/
[23:10:39] <MrPunkin> Cork: thanks so much for the help. Minor changes and now I feel like I have a really solid solution to run external scripts directly within context of my plugin that handles all my mobile sites templating
[23:14:56] <maasha> Cork: exactly. thanks
[23:17:52] <maasha> Cork: well, it does look a little funny that the whole tree loads and the collapses.
[23:19:08] <Cork> ya, alternatively the function generating the spans can take the filter into account
[23:19:40] <maasha> Cork: hmmm.
[23:21:02] <MrMister> if I need to bind many select elements via a .on(), should I loop through them with a $('.my-select-ems').each(function(){ $(this).on(
[23:21:45] <Cork> no
[23:21:48] <MrMister> or is it better to pass the set of objects via $('.my-select-ems').on(function(){ "change" : function(){etc}
[23:22:18] <Cork> $('.my-select-ems').on("change", function(){etc});
[23:22:29] <Cork> or event better use delegated event listeners
[23:22:39] <Cork> ?.on @ MrMister
[23:22:41] <bot-t> MrMister, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:23:24] <MrMister> thanks, Cork, bot-t
[23:23:24] * bot-t sighs
[23:23:27] <danmichel> Im trying to test out this slider to troubleshoot, but it doesn't seem to work on JS Fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/CvDQ4/3/
[23:25:04] <MrMister> Cork, I thought that .on replaced .delegate; Maybe I misunderstand what you mean?
[23:25:58] <Cork> MrMister: not replace no
[23:26:10] <Cork> it provides a way to do delegate calls among other
[23:26:18] <Cork> its a combination function
[23:27:17] <Cork> MrMister: only one of the old functions that's been deprecated is .live
[23:27:54] <MrMister> Thanks. I'm not sure how to delegate, reading docs now
[23:28:21] <Cork> .delegate and .bind is still supported (as they're sane)
[23:28:48] <Cork> MrMister: you bind it on a parent, and give the selector to the second argument to on (or first to .delegate)
[23:30:30] <MrMister> so bind to a container with an id, and then bind the target selector (.my-select-ems)
[23:30:50] <Cork> mmm,no
[23:31:14] <Cork> $('parent').on('click', 'selector', function() {});
[23:33:37] <alexparker> Hello!
[23:34:35] <alexparker> my jQuery() is returning a plain array of dom elements rather than a jQuery object collection of the elements
[23:34:39] <Supervan> Any suggestion on code editor… must have auto complete / tidy up previous code / show start end program loops
[23:34:57] <alexparker> does anyone know what might be causing this?
[23:35:29] <Cork> alexparker: its not query?, or a really old version
[23:36:09] <alexparker> Cork: jQuery().jquery returns "1.7.2"
[23:36:34] <Cork> and you're just calling jQuery('selector')
[23:36:36] <Cork> nothing more?
[23:36:40] <alexparker> yup
[23:36:57] <Cork> sounds like some liberary/plugin is messing with it then
[23:37:14] <Cork> cause no, that's not suppose to ever happen
[23:39:15] <danmichel> Im trying to test out this slider to troubleshoot, but it doesn't seem to work on JS Fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/CvDQ4/4/

[23:50:33] <shashi_> hi, i am using jquery scrollTop function for my select list which is working in chrome, safari, and firefox, But it is not working in MSIE. Can anyone help me about this how can i implement in MSIE also
[23:51:41] <Cork> shashi_: ie uses native windows comboxes, so you can't always do normal html/css things with it
[23:52:21] <Cork> fiddling with the dropdown is one of the things that doesn't really work at all
