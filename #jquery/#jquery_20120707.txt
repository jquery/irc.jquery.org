[00:04:27] <dnsdds> Whenever the UI accordion plays the change animation, the height of it is temporarily reduced by a few pixels. How can I stop this from happening?
[00:15:13] <LoneStar99> howdy!
[00:17:12] <LoneStar99> does js "escape(document.getElementById('vw').value);" --> jq $('#vw').val(); ??
[00:17:33] <LoneStar99> how do i escape() in jquery?
[00:18:12] <c2c> Hello, a small question : if there a way to get all element's attributes, like attr() with no params
[00:19:59] <LoneStar99> c2c like getting the "id" and "class" ??
[00:22:55] <c2c> LoneStar99: ALL attributes
[00:24:28] <LoneStar99> c2c i have been working on something that copies everything from a given element including attributes text etc...
[00:24:33] <LoneStar99> is that what you need?
[00:25:41] <systemfault> c2c: There's nothing in jQuery to do that...
[00:25:52] <systemfault> Because in practice‚Ä¶ it's useless
[00:28:17] <LoneStar99> systemfault how do I escape the following --> (JS) escape(document.getElementById('vw').value);" -->  (JQuery) $('#vw').val();
[00:28:46] <systemfault> escape($('#vw').val())
[00:29:01] <LoneStar99> ok cool simple enough thanks
[00:29:23] <LoneStar99> converting js code to jq
[00:29:40] <systemfault> jQuery doesn't duplicate functionalities already in JS
[00:32:24] <LoneStar99> systemfault: ok
[00:33:39] <c2c> systemfault: ok, i'll extend $.fn myself so. Strange
[00:33:42] <c2c> thanks
[00:34:11] <systemfault> What's strange is that you need that functionality ;)
[00:35:15] <c2c> I'm trying to save all elements attributes for a plugin
[00:35:31] <c2c> so that once finished, everything is reverted as it was before
[00:36:01] <c2c> (plugin is using the submitting form to iframe method)
[00:36:21] <c2c> (yeah I know there's tons of plugins like that, just making one to learn :))
[00:36:40] <coldhead> my condolences
[00:37:14] <c2c> ha ?
[00:37:21] <c2c> thanks
[00:38:20] <c2c> Thinking about FormData ?
[00:43:33] <monkeybite> Hi there! Still having a problem :( Basically I want all li elements in div #secondList -> also in the drop down list -> selected value in drop down should be shown in input text box
[00:43:43] <monkeybite> http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/7/
[00:54:59] <mdunham918_> how can set set the ui-selected items to be drag able after the user has finished selecting one or more items using jqueryui selectable plugin?
[00:57:15] <tintin> ?
[00:57:20] <tintin> ezio: Are you there?
[00:57:43] <LoneStar99> just converted js ajax to jq ajax and they are about the same in length but JQ code looks more streamlined
[00:58:14] <tintin> LoneStar99: jq ajax is a short code
[00:58:42] <LoneStar99> yeah i know, but when converted they are the same lenght almost... kinda weird
[00:58:59] <tintin> Can you pastebin the code ?
[00:59:20] <LoneStar99> what is faster in the browser native JS or JQ?
[00:59:41] <tintin> How to measure that?
[01:00:03] <LoneStar99> not sure...
[01:07:28] <systemfault> LoneStar99: any abstraction has a cost..
[01:08:08] <tintin> Is your system in fault?
[01:08:19] <systemfault> tintin: Depends on you darling.
[01:08:29] <tintin> systemfault: Which system? windows or linux?
[01:08:35] <systemfault> OSX
[01:08:41] <tintin> mac?
[01:08:45] <systemfault> Yeah
[01:09:03] <tintin> mac sucks, use linux
[01:09:10] <systemfault> I do.. at work
[01:09:27] <mikkelb> At my dropdown menu at http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ECB9W/17/ - what's the best way of doing a small delay if the user accidentally moves his or her mouse outside of the hit area?
[01:09:32] <mikkelb> I'm trying to replace http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html with some nice and clean jQuery.
[01:09:53] <tintin> systemfault: Which linux distro?
[01:09:55] <mikkelb> tintin: None of the major operating systems suck.
[01:10:07] <systemfault> tintin: At the moment, Fedora 17
[01:10:42] <mikkelb> tintin: You were way cooler in your rap video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icqLmh7ADf4
[01:11:39] <LoneStar99> systemfault: so JQ will be a bit slower right?
[01:11:55] <systemfault> LoneStar99: negligibly slower, yes..
[01:12:19] <monkeybite> Hi there! Still having a problem :( Basically I want all li elements in div #secondList -> also in the drop down list -> selected value in drop down should be shown in input text box. What is the best approach for this? Newbie at Jquery! Link here: http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/7/
[01:12:24] <systemfault> LoneStar99: But you don't have to think about IE..
[01:13:15] <systemfault> LoneStar99: If you can see the difference, you deserve a medal
[01:13:18] <LoneStar99> have two identical codes -->  http://pastebin.com/gfEu9U71  and JQ  http://pastebin.com/zr06QtMU
[01:14:13] <systemfault> LoneStar99: use promises to make the code a bit nicer
[01:14:24] <systemfault> LoneStar99: Forget that .ajax has a success callback
[01:14:55] <LoneStar99> promises?
[01:15:12] <systemfault> Yeah‚Ä¶ .done() and .fail()
[01:15:46] <systemfault> $.ajax({configuration without the success callback}).done(function(data) {}).fail(function() {});
[01:16:10] <LoneStar99> oh yeah, i should ... but i never use the fail...
[01:16:20] <systemfault> Then just use .done()
[01:16:35] <systemfault> You can even do it without chaining
[01:16:59] <systemfault> var myAjaxTransaction = $.ajax({configuration without the success callback}); myAjaxTransaction.done(function(data) {});
[01:17:48] <LoneStar99> does irc use PUSH technology?
[01:18:13] <systemfault> IRC is a TCP text protocol..
[01:18:57] <systemfault> Hmm.. you should also reuse you variables..
[01:19:09] <systemfault> You have escape($('#pg').val()); twice in your code
[01:20:08] <LoneStar99> good point, need to clean it up, was just modifying line by line to make sure code would work exactly as the original JS
[01:23:57] <LoneStar99> systemfault: thanks for your help!
[01:24:09] <systemfault> You're welcome
[01:25:36] <LoneStar99> what time zone u at?
[01:25:40] <LoneStar99> pst?
[01:26:39] <systemfault> est
[01:27:03] <systemfault> Yeah‚Ä¶ it's 4:30am..
[01:27:23] <monkeybite> LoneStar99, could you take a look at my problem? Would be greatly appreciated!
[01:27:57] <LoneStar99> damn cst here
[01:28:17] <LoneStar99> monkeybite: what type of issue u having?
[01:29:57] <monkeybite> I have two lists (fruits I like and hate for example). And all fruits in the "love list" should directly be shown in a dropdown. And the value I select in the drop down should be shown in the text box.
[01:30:01] <monkeybite> Heh, understand? :)
[01:30:05] <monkeybite> See here:
[01:30:06] <monkeybite> http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/7/
[01:30:25] <monkeybite> as it is right now "pineapple" and "orange" should be shown in the drop down.
[01:30:47] <monkeybite> and if I then choose "orange" in the drop down, "orange" should be shown in the textbox
[01:32:51] <LoneStar99> let me take a look
[01:37:14] <ura> hi
[01:38:46] <ura> jquery has a nice feature, translating css keys in the way that backgroundColor becomes background-color, it's very handy since there is no need to quote attribute
[01:39:02] <monkeybite> LoneStar99 would really appreciate it!
[01:39:26] <ura> Is there is something for class attibute? I tired to quote it over and over.
[01:40:17] <ura> e.g. $('<div>', { 'class': 'foo' }) would be neater if to write like $('<div>', { _class: 'foo' })
[01:41:53] <systemfault> ura: what?
[01:42:15] <hemangpatel> hello guys
[01:42:24] <systemfault> ura: Try to use background-color as a key without quoting..
[01:42:43] <hemangpatel> is anyone has used http://www.gzip.org/ ?
[01:42:52] <ura> But you just can't write { class: 'foo' }, class is a reserved keyword
[01:43:12] <systemfault> I mean.. background-color is not a valid key.
[01:43:22] <systemfault> It's not reserved‚Ä¶ but it contains a -
[01:43:40] <systemfault> (valid key without quotes)
[01:44:22] <systemfault> hemangpatel: How is that related to jQuery or the web?
[01:44:37] <ura> systemfault, that's what I say, you can use backgroundColor instead
[01:44:42] <hemangpatel> it compress js & css ..
[01:44:54] <systemfault> hemangpatel: ...
[01:45:15] <systemfault> hemangpatel: You don't compress your js and css manually‚Ä¶ your server does it.
[01:45:18] <LoneStar99> monkeybite:  from your code it seems that the "droppable" list is sortable, but there is no code for it add the selections to the selection box
[01:45:36] <systemfault> hemangpatel: An example is mod_deflate on apache2
[01:45:39] <hemangpatel> systemfault : that i want to know friend.
[01:47:06] <ura> systemfault, so I'm seeking alternative syntax for class attribute, since class attribute suffers from the same problem as background-color, it needs to be quoted
[01:47:30] <systemfault> I personally have no problem with quoting..
[01:48:07] <ura> when just one attribute quoted and others are not it looks not very good
[01:48:27] <systemfault> Heh‚Ä¶
[01:48:31] <monkeybite> LoneStar99 exactly. It's the connection from "droppable" to the dropdown I have no clue what to do =/
[01:49:19] <LoneStar99> oh ok,  let me think...
[01:49:38] <LoneStar99> let me try something
[02:02:57] <LoneStar99> monkeybite: you still there?
[02:03:10] <monkeybite> absolutely!
[02:03:13] <monkeybite> LoneStar99
[02:03:51] <LoneStar99> ok getting close
[02:05:52] <monkeybite> sweeet! :)
[02:06:11] <LoneStar99> might be abit dirty...
[02:16:21] <Rinthe> http://ericpaints.it/about/ anyone know why when i click on the circles, they disappear??
[02:20:58] <monkeybite> LoneStar99 any luck? cuz i
[02:21:04] <monkeybite> *i'm stuck :(
[02:23:24] <LoneStar99> monkeybite: ok this out needs some cleaning, --> http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/10/
[02:29:58] <Rinthe> anyone?
[02:31:01] <LoneStar99> monkeybite: have u messed with it?
[02:32:16] <monkeybite> LoneStar99 will check it out any minute now, food is in the making atm
[02:33:32] <LoneStar99> k

[03:09:19] <marandi> hi guys , i use bunch of plugin in my project like pretty photo , slide and ..... ! everythings worked untill i use ajax ! when i use ajax and create new object , plugins wont effect new objects ! what should i do guys
[03:11:16] <mouzone> marandi: I have the same problem.
[03:11:31] <mouzone> marandi: I use a bunch of plugins but nothing works. What the fuck?
[03:11:37] <nlogax> marandi: Could it be that the plugins look in the document for certain elements at a certain point, and are unuware of stuff added later?
[03:12:13] <marandi> nlogax: dude , can u speake a little bit more simple ? i dunno know english well
[03:16:24] <mikkelb> marandi: Where are you from?

[03:32:51] <Whirl3d> Good Morning all.
[03:33:48] <hemangpatel> GM.
[03:34:57] <Whirl3d> if you want to overide and existing method can you store a reference to it's original function inside of it? In other words $.fn.show.proto=$.fn.show; $.fn.show=function () {if (condition) {do alternate stuff}, else {this.proto(arguments)}}; ?
[03:35:50] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d nope
[03:35:55] <Whirl3d> probably not....now that I am lookin' at it. LOL
[03:36:08] <BinaryKitten> mainly because you're then overwriting it again
[03:36:34] <BinaryKitten> $.fn._oldshow = $.fn.show;
[03:36:46] <Whirl3d> I guess I don't really need to override anything. I'll just make an altShow();
[03:36:57] <Whirl3d> and rewrite any references to show manually in my scripts
[03:37:38] <BinaryKitten> actually if you are changing show, then you shouldn't be using altShow
[03:37:53] <Whirl3d> I won't change show
[03:37:55] <BinaryKitten> might be best if we can see the code
[03:38:19] <Whirl3d> I'll leave it and just change my code to use altShow.. probably cleaner anyway
[03:38:21] <BinaryKitten> what is altShow doing?
[03:38:43] <Whirl3d> Just exhibiting a specific animation behavior for my different elements
[03:39:11] <Whirl3d> so pages will use altShow to animate like a page where buttons will use altShow to animate differently.
[03:39:13] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d you could bind a custom event to them
[03:39:16] <BinaryKitten> and then trigger that
[03:39:29] <Whirl3d> That's how I have it setup now
[03:39:33] <BinaryKitten> that is best
[03:39:42] <BinaryKitten> unless altShow does the same for everything
[03:40:05] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, perhaps you could give me some advice about this general concept.
[03:40:10] <BinaryKitten> sure
[03:40:37] <Whirl3d> It seems that I am constantly running the same paradigm....I have a list of elements (in different layers of heirarchy) that need to have one current element
[03:40:44] <Whirl3d> a next method, prev method
[03:40:46] <Whirl3d> etc.
[03:41:04] <Whirl3d> it's really common and I don't see why they all need their own implimentations.
[03:41:25] <Whirl3d> One state controller with access to specific librarys for each class should be able to manage that
[03:41:39] <Fudge_> Hey, I'm having an issue with some code.
[03:41:40] <Fudge_> http://pastie.org/private/dx6qf2vleyzumhlty8vdg
[03:41:58] <Fudge_> What I want to do is get the styles of all the divs in the header and store them in the css variable
[03:42:47] <BinaryKitten> Fudge_ that's not possible with the .css
[03:42:57] <Fudge_> oh...
[03:43:07] <Fudge_> BinaryKitten: Any method that does what I want?
[03:43:18] <BinaryKitten> .css takes in a style attribute name
[03:43:25] <Fudge_> I need to change the CSS and restore it back at a later time
[03:43:40] <BinaryKitten> Fudge_ use classes
[03:43:51] <BinaryKitten> change the class, change that back later
[03:43:53] <Fudge_> actully
[03:43:56] <BinaryKitten> the class control the css
[03:43:57] <Fudge_> actually*
[03:43:59] <Fudge_> thats a good idea
[03:44:07] <Fudge_> one sec
[03:44:20] <Fudge_> BinaryKitten: whats the method to change classes?
[03:44:36] <BinaryKitten> .addClass  and .removeClass
[03:44:46] <Fudge_> ah, I see
[03:44:56] <Whirl3d> .addClass, removeClass, .attr("class",classname) and .hasClass  and .is(.classname)
[03:46:00] <BinaryKitten> also .toggleClass
[03:46:09] <BinaryKitten> and i personally wouldn't touch .attr
[03:46:14] <BinaryKitten> (in this instance)
[03:46:21] <Whirl3d> good one...I always forget about .toggleClass
[03:46:59] <Whirl3d> Yeah, don't use .attr("class", classname)    but .attr("class") is nice to give you the list of classes assigned to an element.
[03:47:30] <Whirl3d> .toggleClass requries UI, though doesn't it?
[03:48:44] <NodeX> no
[03:48:53] <Fudge_> nice
[03:48:57] <Fudge_> works perfectly now :)
[03:50:35] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d at 1 point in distant past
[03:50:37] <Fudge_> BinaryKitten: I'm using addClass now, how do I use fadeIn() with it?
[03:50:57] <BinaryKitten> Fudge_ straight after
[03:51:23] <Fudge_> BinaryKitten: not working
[03:51:30] <Fudge_> I'll pastie my code
[03:51:36] <Whirl3d> Fudge_ do you have to support old browsers? Cause you could manage the fading with css3 really easily.
[03:51:39] <BinaryKitten> eg $('item').fadeOut(function() { $(this).addClass('newClass').removeClass('oldclass').fadeIn() });
[03:52:16] <Fudge_> Whirl3d: Yeah, need to support old browsers. Was using CSS3 transitions but its not cross-browser supported to jQuery's probably the best option
[03:52:58] <Whirl3d> Just fyi, I use transit.js.....it automagically converts most of my jquery animations to css animations without any work on my part.
[03:53:12] <sviatovigt> hi
[03:53:26] <sviatovigt> I have a function with an ajax request in it
[03:54:03] <sviatovigt> how ca I return the data received through the ajax request from that function?
[03:54:43] <ruby_on_tails> sviatovigt: you will have to make the ajax request non-async
[03:54:56] <ruby_on_tails> save the data in a variable and then return it from the parent function
[03:54:57] <sviatovigt> thank you
[03:55:07] <ruby_on_tails> but it has its negatives
[03:55:23] <BinaryKitten> freezing ui
[03:55:30] <BinaryKitten> delay in processing
[03:55:36] <ruby_on_tails> yes, the screen will freeze till the ajax request completes
[03:55:37] <BinaryKitten> potential system breaks
[03:55:52] <sviatovigt> aha
[03:55:53] <sviatovigt> ok
[03:56:38] <sviatovigt> since I have never used the non-async, I have to ask, the drawbacks are that bad?
[03:56:48] <BinaryKitten> they can be
[03:56:53] <BinaryKitten> also the might not be
[03:56:54] <ruby_on_tails> if the ajax request is heavy it can be bad
[03:57:12] <ruby_on_tails> if its lightning fast, then not so much
[03:57:13] <sviatovigt> is there any other way to avoid this?
[03:57:33] <ruby_on_tails> what is the purpose of this ajax request ?
[03:57:42] <BinaryKitten> sviatovigt since we're only working with the abstract here, we might need more informatiopn
[03:58:08] <sviatovigt> I have a lot of ajax requests on my page
[03:58:27] <sviatovigt> so I thought it will be a good ideea to put all of them in one function
[03:58:41] <sviatovigt> and to have from that function the data received from the server
[03:58:50] <sviatovigt> and then manipulate that data
[03:58:58] <sviatovigt> I have for tabs
[03:59:00] <BinaryKitten> sviatovigt ah that chestnut
[03:59:08] <ruby_on_tails> i nested them all inside the ajax callbacks, and the last one in the nest would trigger a function with the success data
[03:59:16] <BinaryKitten> craft a anonymous function that does what you need
[03:59:22] <BinaryKitten> and pass that to the request
[03:59:36] <ruby_on_tails> hmm yes, thats also good
[03:59:45] <BinaryKitten> that way you don't need to worry about waiting and processing
[03:59:53] <ruby_on_tails> i had made a mess out of my code nesting ajax requests :))=))
[04:00:00] <sviatovigt> BinaryKitten: anonymous function?
[04:00:19] <sviatovigt> ruby_on_rails: that's what I was trying to do
[04:00:20] <BinaryKitten> yes
[04:00:50] <BinaryKitten> any time you use " function " without a name its creating a lambda or annoymous function
[04:01:03] <sviatovigt> oooo
[04:01:04] <sviatovigt> ok
[04:01:08] <BinaryKitten> eg var myFunc = function() { /* stuff here */ }; is anonymous
[04:01:22] <sviatovigt> ok
[04:01:26] <sviatovigt> now I understand
[04:01:39] <BinaryKitten> $.post(url, function(data) {}, 'json'); <---- function there = anonymous
[04:01:57] <sviatovigt> aha
[04:01:59] <sviatovigt> ok
[04:02:00] <sviatovigt> thank
[04:02:01] <BinaryKitten> so $.post(url, myFunc, 'json') would call the earlier one
[04:02:03] <sviatovigt> thanks
[04:04:14] <sviatovigt> and how will the data be accessible?
[04:04:51] <sviatovigt> I suppose this way I can avoid writing the same lines of code multiple times...
[04:07:24] <BinaryKitten> sviatovigt same way as before
[04:07:42] <BinaryKitten> your lambda/anonymous functions still will take in the data var
[04:19:50] <Whirl3d> is there an easy way to grab the properties of a named css class?
[04:20:37] <coldhead> instantiate an instance of it and iterate over the properties?
[04:20:51] <coldhead> i think you want cssQuery
[04:20:55] <coldhead> not sure if that exists
[04:21:48] <Whirl3d> is there an alternate for of animate that lets you say $(elem).animate(endclass, ......
[04:22:02] <Whirl3d> where endclass is a css-defined class
[04:22:20] <coldhead> ?animateclass
[04:22:21] <bot-t> coldhead, UI/Effects/ClassTransitions - The jQuery UI effects core extends the base class API to be able to animate between two different classes. The following methods are changed. They now accept three additional parameters: speed , ea... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/ClassTransitions
[04:22:30] <Whirl3d> beautiful, thank you
[04:22:34] <coldhead> ENJOY
[04:23:34] <Whirl3d> aha, it's .switchClass...
[04:23:49] <Whirl3d> Why do I get the feeling this is soo to be deprecated...
[04:23:53] <Whirl3d> *soon
[04:24:56] <sviatovigt> BinaryKitten: are you still here?
[04:25:10] <rockethouse> hey, im using jQuery to generate some list items, and I then want to use jquery again in a new function to do something to those list items... how can I trigger a function AFTER another function has completed?
[04:30:08] <Whirl3d> rockethouse, you can see where that is an impossible question to answer completely. There are too many conditions possible to give you the correct answer for every one. You can just call one jquery command after the other, for example if you want. If they happen asynchronously, you may need a callback or deferred mechanism.
[04:31:57] <rockethouse> Whilr3d - OMG nevermind... idiot... I never loaded the jquery file...I think i've had too many wines tonight
[04:32:08] <Whirl3d> lol
[04:33:00] <rockethouse> but basically.. i had Nivoslider generating some thumbnails, and then using another jquery plugin to create a carousel out of those thumbnails... i thought it wasnt working becase the thumbnails were being generated by jquery so the carousel plugin couldnt find those elements because they didnt originally exist..
[04:36:37] <Whirl3d> That of course depends on whether the carousel plugin is self-initiaiting or if you can call the initialization function and pass it a list of thumbnails.
[04:36:45] <Whirl3d> which is usually the case
[04:38:24] <coldhead> you shouldn't worry too much about your code working because no one will ever visit your site :(
[04:39:05] <Whirl3d> ouch, wat?
[04:40:11] <marandi> mouzone: Russia
[04:41:35] <marandi> hi guys , i use bunch of plugin in my project like pretty photo , slide and ..... ! everythings worked untill i use ajax ! when i use ajax and create new object , plugins wont effect new objects ! what should i do guys
[04:42:17] <coldhead> http://screenshotsofdespair.tumblr.com/page/2
[04:43:17] <Whirl3d> marandi, you have to reinitialize the plugins with the newly loaded content.
[04:43:37] <coldhead> marandi: look at the success callback for ajax(). you can re-apply the plugins there
[04:43:42] * coldhead hi5s Whirl3d 
[04:43:55] <marandi> Whirl3d: Comon ! its like 30 plugin !
[04:44:13] <Whirl3d> It's your bad design, not mine.
[04:44:30] <Whirl3d> if you want to use that many plugins on every newly loaded content, don't yell at me
[04:44:31] <coldhead> marandi: its easier if you start with the AJAX and THEN do the plugins
[04:44:57] <marandi> Whirl3d: i didnt yell dude ! i just said any other way , maybe ?
[04:45:08] <coldhead> lol
[04:45:10] <sendoushi> has anyone tried ember or angular?
[04:45:14] <coldhead> try restarting your gombuter
[04:45:54] <Whirl3d> marandi, sorry, where I come from exclamation points are reserved for yelling
[04:46:16] <marandi> Whirl3d: ooppps ok ,
[04:46:23] <Whirl3d> and when I say re-initialize, it doesn't mean reload
[04:46:51] <Whirl3d> if you are running tabs, for example on newly loaded tabbed content, you will have to say $(newcontent).tabs();
[04:46:53] <marandi> Whirl3d: wait , i wanna show u something !
[04:46:55] <Whirl3d> for example
[04:47:15] <Whirl3d> or whatever each plugin's init function is..
[04:49:14] <rockethouse> coldhead do you want to see the site?
[04:49:34] * Whirl3d does
[04:49:44] <rockethouse> im a designer not a developer - and working from home, so i dont have my developer 5m away doing it all for me
[04:49:50] <marandi> Whirl3d: check it out : https://gist.github.com/3066038 its my main.js file!
[04:51:30] <Whirl3d> marandi, but what does it do?
[04:51:46] <marandi> Whirl3d: call all plugins
[04:52:57] <Whirl3d> lol. all at once?
[04:53:00] <Whirl3d> wtf?
[04:53:06] <Whirl3d> call them only when you need them
[04:53:24] <marandi> Whirl3d: its not my code , i bought it
[04:54:19] <Whirl3d> you got ripped off, I'm afraid. Maybe not, but it seems unreasonable to have all of your code iniitialization functions run at the start..   what if you don't have a form? your form init functions are gonna fail
[04:54:33] <Whirl3d> your bar functions will fail without  whatever a bar is
[04:54:42] <coldhead> if you bought it then it IS your code
[04:54:55] <Sythius> your property
[04:55:03] <coldhead> enjoy!
[05:02:11] <Sythius> does this irc cover jquery general discussion?
[05:02:48] <Whirl3d> yes
[05:04:03] <Sythius> is it common to include the whole jquery library or to include what you need?
[05:04:42] <coldhead> its common just to include the whole library
[05:04:47] <coldhead> it's not THAT big
[05:04:58] <coldhead> and you can get it out of the browser cache, usually
[05:05:25] <Sythius> i were just thinking i used to include the whole library which if i remember is 20k
[05:06:15] <Sythius> for web pages it i aimed for less than 20k
[05:07:19] <Sythius> do you think jquery is faster for websites?
[05:07:31] <coldhead> it's fast enough, man
[05:07:49] <coldhead> if you want to be all obsessive about it you should check out microjs.com
[05:08:07] <coldhead> but if you just want an easy life where things work, jQuery :)
[05:08:49] <Sythius> yeah i agree, if you dont want a headache jquery is way to go
[05:10:36] <Sythius> i just want to throw some ideas about, when i did javascript i wrote some animations like resize, slide diagonal, flash and blink
[05:10:41] <Sythius> what do you recon jquery is missing
[05:12:29] <infinityartworx> if you want show an article to only registered users then u have to....
[05:13:21] <Sythius> do we have a rule list for this channel?
[05:15:02] <Sythius> how do you become a registered user?
[05:15:33] <infinityartworx> Sythius: please relax
[05:16:12] <Sythius> sorry, got bad ocd for learning, ill chill for a bit
[05:17:23] <sviatovigt> in the documentation of jquery.ajax, it says that async:false is deprecated
[05:17:28] <sviatovigt> what should I use instead
[05:17:30] <sviatovigt> ?
[05:17:42] <coldhead> async: true?
[05:18:05] <coldhead> Sythius: the only rule is try not to be a jerk
[05:18:09] <coldhead> but even that is relaxed
[05:18:38] <sviatovigt> async:true is the default value
[05:18:43] <coldhead> ?cc
[05:18:44] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[05:18:57] <sviatovigt> and the request is made asynchronously
[05:19:03] <coldhead> great job everyone, take 5
[05:19:16] <sviatovigt> I want to make it synchronously
[05:19:36] <coldhead> do you really?
[05:19:47] <coldhead> locking up the browser makes users sad
[05:20:04] <sviatovigt> I know
[05:20:33] <coldhead> you can still use asynch: false
[05:20:35] <sviatovigt> but I also want to know how can I use that option in case I need it
[05:20:41] <coldhead> don't let the docs push you around!
[05:20:41] <dabear_> sviatovigt: all i/o should be async, that's why it's deprecated
[05:20:56] <coldhead> the docs aren't the boss of you!
[05:21:44] <KingTorstein> hi. i'm trying to send a lot of form data as a post request to the server (so i can process it with php), but i can't seem to get the data format correct. the code in question is at http://jsfiddle.net/hKnqT/
[05:23:00] <coldhead> sweet zombie jesus, KingTorstein
[05:23:13] <sviatovigt> holly cow
[05:23:15] <coldhead> you should just provide all the params to jQuery and let it encode them for you
[05:23:31] <sviatovigt> what did you do there KingTorstein?
[05:23:43] <KingTorstein> i dont know. :(
[05:23:51] <coldhead> ..., data{ foo: var_name1, bar: var_name2, aids: lol, etc: etc, ... }
[05:24:24] <KingTorstein> the thing is, the number of parameters are variable
[05:25:23] <ian___> I'm trying to learn jquery. Each time I try, I give up. I go to the jquery site, click on 'tutorials', click on the first one, and spend the weekend trying to understand it. Over the past year or so I've not understood one word of it and I end up giving up each time.
[05:25:39] <coldhead> that's very sad, ian___
[05:25:45] <KingTorstein> thats why there's a for loop going through an array to add the variable field names. how to do that properly then?
[05:25:50] <coldhead> would you be happier with a screencast maybe?
[05:25:54] <ian___> The very first sentence makes no sense at all, and I can't decipher it. ‚Äú To write a jQuery plugin, start by adding a new function property to the jQuery.fn object where the name of the property is the name of your plugin‚Äù
[05:26:00] <Stephen> $() = document.getElementById
[05:26:02] <Stephen> Done
[05:26:05] <coldhead> KingTorstein: lemme do you a quick demo
[05:26:24] <Sythius> ian: ill give you some help if you want, pm me
[05:26:41] <Stephen> Deferreds are like functions, but they only run once and their results are cached
[05:28:13] <ian___> The first tutorial fails to explain most of the things I don‚Äôt understand. It starts with ‚Äú To write a jQuery plugin‚Äù. What does that mean? Then it says ‚Äú start by adding a new function property to the jQuery.fn object‚Äù. What does that mean? And on it goes.
[05:29:05] <sviatovigt> ian___: do you know/understand javascript?
[05:29:11] <sviatovigt> pure juavascript?
[05:29:13] <KingTorstein> coldhead: that'd be really nice! i'm currently stuck
[05:29:13] <ian___> not yet
[05:29:22] <dabear_> ian___: so you want to write a plugin, but you fail to understand what ‚Äú To write a jQuery plugin‚Äù means?
[05:29:23] <sviatovigt> then do that first
[05:29:23] <Stephen> ian___: Ok, a jQuery plugin is simply a function which chains with other jQuery functions
[05:29:33] <coldhead> KingTorstein: here's a bunch of ways to set data and send it via ajax http://jsfiddle.net/5rMK2/
[05:29:37] <Stephen> jquery uses a concept called fluent code
[05:29:41] <ian___> I just want to learn jquery for the first time
[05:29:52] <ian___> what does ‚Äúplugin‚Äù mean?
[05:29:53] <sviatovigt> you shouldn't
[05:29:54] <Stephen> ian___: You need to learn javascript first
[05:29:59] <Sythius> start with hiding a div
[05:30:01] <sviatovigt> that's not the right order
[05:30:07] <Stephen> "Plugin" means "Addon"
[05:30:17] <sviatovigt> it like putting the carriage in front of the horses
[05:30:23] <ian___> what does ‚ÄúAddon‚Äù mean?
[05:30:23] <Stephen> You can create custom pieces of code to add onto the jquery framework
[05:30:37] <Stephen> jquery is a framework, not a language
[05:30:41] <Stephen> Javascript is the language
[05:30:54] <sviatovigt> ian___: do you know what a framework is?
[05:30:55] <Stephen> jquery is kinda like shorthand is to english
[05:30:59] <Stephen> but much more useful
[05:31:00] <ian___> each weekend I try and learn jQuery, but get pretty much no further than the very first tutorial.
[05:31:09] <coldhead> ian___: have you looked at this? this is a nice gentle intro http://jqfundamentals.com/
[05:31:10] <sviatovigt> ian___: do you know what a framework is?
[05:31:18] <ian___> The first like of the first tutorial, in fact.
[05:31:25] <Stephen> Hmmm...
[05:31:26] <Stephen> I know
[05:31:27] <ian___> The first line of the first tutorial, in fact.
[05:31:32] <Stephen> ian___, what browser are you using?
[05:31:38] <ian___> chrome
[05:31:42] <dabear_> so if you're not into programming in general, why do you wanna learn jquery?
[05:31:42] <ben_alman> .tweet cowboy
[05:31:44] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Tweet from cowboy: OH "jquery uses a concept called fluent code" (actual comment in Freenode #jquery IRC channel) You should idle there, it's a hoot! ‚òÖ http://bit.ly/Ppu4Bu
[05:31:49] <Stephen> Ok, have you been in the javascript console in chrome yet?
[05:31:54] <ian___> no
[05:32:00] <Stephen> I suggest first doing that
[05:32:05] <ian___> I'm still reading up about jquery
[05:32:19] <ian___> the very first tutorial is where I'm stuck
[05:32:21] <Stephen> It's easier to learn jquery when you're writing it
[05:32:39] <ian___> perhaps, but I don't get the first example
[05:32:41] <Stephen> the console will allow you to write javascript and get immediate results
[05:32:53] <dabear_> troll?
[05:32:55] <ian___> this one: jQuery.fn.myPlugin = function() {
[05:33:11] <sviatovigt> ian___: this becomes embarrassing
[05:33:42] <sviatovigt> you should stop asking this questions as long as everyone told you to read the documentation of javascript first
[05:33:46] <coldhead> have you considered a career in landscape gardening, instead?
[05:34:14] <sviatovigt> it can be very tricky if not difficult to understand jquery if you don't have a clue about javascript
[05:34:17] <ian___> you lot are really no help at all ‚Äî¬†about as much use as the beginning tutorial
[05:34:44] <sviatovigt> ian___: everyone here helps as much as he can
[05:35:00] <sviatovigt> we helped you by telling you that you direction is wrong
[05:35:14] <sviatovigt> you should start reading about javascript
[05:35:32] <ian___> What I don‚Äôt understand is the very first line of the initial tutorial, where it opens with ‚Äú So you've become comfortable with jQuery and would like to learn how to write your own plugins. ‚Äù.
[05:35:34] <dabear_> help someone? I read about this thing called a "car"
[05:35:43] <sviatovigt> is like asking us to help you understand multiplication when you don't know adding
[05:35:48] <dabear_> How do I build a car now?
[05:35:54] <ian___> How can I have become comfortable with it when I‚Äôve only just started the first tutorial?
[05:36:06] <Sythius> ian___: private message me ill help you understand
[05:36:19] <coldhead> ian___: start with the 2nd tutorial
[05:36:20] <nlogax> Sounds like you are reading a plugin tutorial rather than a jQuery introduction/tutorial
[05:36:21] <coldhead> or the 3rd
[05:36:36] <ian___> I'm reading the very first tutorial in the list, of course.
[05:36:36] <sviatovigt> nlogax: I have the same impression
[05:36:44] <ian___> That's where one starts something new.
[05:36:48] <sviatovigt> although I admit that I haven't read any of the tutorials
[05:37:07] <ian___> I don't know enough to go on to the second tutorial
[05:37:08] <coldhead> nlogax: the plugin tutorial is the first tutorial on the jquery.com Tutorials page
[05:37:23] <coldhead> it actually is
[05:37:27] <nlogax> MAKES SENSE
[05:37:52] <ian___> Once I understand that, I‚Äôll look at the second one. Obviously.
[05:38:02] <ian___> But for now, I have to take the first step.
[05:38:03] <sviatovigt> ian___: read this: http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works
[05:38:14] <nlogax> ian___: They are listed in arbitrary order, you shouldn't start with the one about plugins
[05:38:16] <coldhead> jQuery Tutorials: Tutorial 1: Your First JavaScript compiler. A Tour of the v8 Source.
[05:38:17] <sviatovigt> and come back if you don't understand it
[05:39:16] <KingTorstein> coldhead: thank you! the way i did it was retarded :D got it to work
[05:39:33] <coldhead> hooray KingTorstein! good luck
[05:40:03] <coldhead> now there is a man who didn't start with the plugin tutorial
[05:42:57] <dabear_> torstein.. sounds norwegian, but you're in the US
[05:42:58] <dabear_> hmm
[05:43:24] <KingTorstein> i'm in norway. using freenode webchat because i couldn't be bothered to install a proper irc client :D

[06:13:16] <SmokingSlim> hi guys, I was wondering if you could include another .js file in the document.ready() ?
[06:13:39] <SmokingSlim> like $(document).ready(functuon()){}
[06:14:03] <SmokingSlim> like $(document).ready(functuon()){ @import or include ="file.js"} ?
[06:15:14] <ravenzz> ?getScript @ SmokingSlim
[06:15:14] <bot-t> SmokingSlim, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[06:16:04] <jcubic> does getScript do ajax call or add script tag to the header?
[06:16:06] <coldhead> "then execute it", it sounds like an act of war
[06:16:18] <SmokingSlim> ty bot-t :)
[06:16:18] <coldhead> script tag, jcubic
[06:17:04] <KingTorstein> maybe his script's name is SeanBean.js
[06:17:33] <ravenzz> coldhead jcubic ajax request
[06:18:20] <ravenzz> it is a shorthand of $.ajax where the dataType is set to "script"
[06:27:52] <diverdude> when i need to use a parameter in my jquery ready function which is set by the page being loaded, usually what I do is that i create a hidden field on the page with the desired value and an id, and in my document ready i then grab the value from the hidden field. This approach works, but it feels wrongs that i need to create a temporary placeholder like such a hidden field just to be able to use the value in the document ready function. How do y
[06:27:53] <diverdude> ou guys usually deal with this problem?
[06:28:18] <xmaddness> data-ids
[06:31:05] <xmaddness> or do a x = $(this).attr('data-something');
[06:31:20] <xmaddness> We usually pass it in as a json
[06:31:37] <anli_> What does the parameter contain?
[06:31:37] <xmaddness> then do a values = $.parseJSON(x);

[07:57:24] <monkeybite> any idea how to get the words in the list?
[07:57:25] <phonebook_> i know th answer but have maybe had ONE too many
[07:57:42] <monkeybite> haha :)
[07:57:58] <phonebook_> the problem is how you are getting the string... its turning it into an array, you know that... so maybe something with split?
[08:00:30] <phonebook_> .each li is calling
[08:00:41] <phonebook_> srmy man, my intelectual faculties are pwned
[08:05:37] <monkeybite> yay phonebook_
[08:05:37] <monkeybite> http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/13/
[08:05:59] <phonebook_> oh you got it? i was just getting serious to find an answr
[08:06:01] <phonebook_> e
[08:06:21] <phonebook_> excellent!
[08:06:22] <monkeybite> next step! getting the selected element in the drop down to be shown in the text box
[08:06:26] <monkeybite> any ideas there? :)
[08:07:57] <phonebook_> step 1 http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/13/
[08:08:40] <monkeybite> same as I posted (?)
[08:08:45] <monkeybite> click "update" to get a new url
[08:08:51] <phonebook_> step 2 is fancy jqyery selectors and then having the text set as that
[08:09:04] <phonebook_> sry
[08:09:07] <phonebook_> .... step 1
[08:09:16] <phonebook_> 14
[08:09:45] <monkeybite> heh, you know any of these fancy jquery selectors? :)
[08:12:41] <LuisLeite> anyone know how i can remove a tr, by cliking a td? ( without id's )
[08:13:24] <phonebook_> sry -- so work on something like this - $(selector).on("change", function(){$("#target").val()"changed"});
[08:13:30] <phonebook_> ??
[08:14:13] <phonebook_> ive had ONE too many for this, forget me
[08:14:24] <phonebook_> but what i said is a devcent start
[08:14:27] <monkeybite> "one too many" what bro? :D
[08:14:29] <monkeybite> drinks?
[08:14:55] <phonebook_> yes, one too many 4.1% 12 oz drinks
[08:15:17] <phonebook_> mikes hard lemonade at before noon
[08:15:41] <monkeybite> haha sweet! what time is it for you?
[08:15:43] <monkeybite> 17:14 here
[08:15:44] <phonebook_> anyway, your question about li is far too hard
[08:16:23] <phonebook_> its early
[08:20:37] <Krambiorix> hi guys, does anyone have any idea why the hyperlink doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/SpHyM/2/
[08:21:25] <anli_> Is it a problem setting a negative margin-top in chrome?
[08:23:01] <jcubic> Krambiorix remove < /script>‚Äã from your code
[08:23:59] <jcubic> jsFiddle embed your code inside $(window).load(function(){ <CODE> })
[08:26:50] <Krambiorix> jcubic, thx!
[08:27:11] <Krambiorix> jcubic, can the onclick method be attached to the <TR> ?
[08:28:01] <xmaddness> Krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/SpHyM/3/
[08:28:33] <xmaddness> the selector was not on the right element for getting those ids
[08:28:57] <xmaddness> $(this) refers to the element selected, which was the <a>, but the <a> did not have the data- attributes in it
[08:29:55] <Krambiorix> xmaddness, thanks mate. BUT, i wanted to attach the onclick to the <tr>, tablerow
[08:30:12] <jcubic> Krambiorix, you can attach it to TR too, if you click on TD the event will bubble up to TR
[08:30:56] <xmaddness> Krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/SpHyM/4/
[08:31:41] <Krambiorix> great!
[08:35:42] <diverdude> i load a.js with a function foo() and then inside $(function(){}) in b.js which is loaded after a.js, i call foo() but i get undefined function foo(). why=?
[08:36:42] <diverdude> nvm
[08:36:44] <diverdude> it works
[08:42:23] <Posterdati> is there any experienced jquerist? I need help to make galleriffic works in a jquery dialog, please help... Thanks
[08:46:58] <jammsen> i search a dynamic generated form, is that possible with jquery? i am kinda new to this stuff, have no idea to google other then "jquery dynamic form" but its not like what im searching. Any idea?
[08:46:59] <Krambiorix> xmaddness, can it be like this too?? $(mytable tr) ..... ?
[08:49:48] <tman-> if i want to insert a character after a space of a selector.text() how would i do that?
[08:49:55] <tman-> do i have to split it add it join it?
[08:49:58] <xmaddness> Krambiorix: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[08:49:59] <tman-> or is there a method for that.
[08:50:07] <xmaddness> Krambiorix: short answer, yes
[08:50:59] <Krambiorix> xmaddness, even when the table will be built with ajax afterwards?
[08:51:38] <monkeybite> Okay guys! I want the mousedown-event to be an on change-event instead
[08:51:39] <monkeybite> http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/18/
[08:52:02] <xmaddness> Krambiorix: using a form of the .on, yes
[08:52:13] <monkeybite> I.e when the div #seondList changes (an new item is dragged to it) I want to do the event function
[08:52:18] <xmaddness> You would be looking for /live, but just as a reference. .live is now deprecated
[08:52:26] <xmaddness> .live(0*
[08:52:28] <xmaddness> !
[08:52:30] <xmaddness> .live()
[08:52:41] <Krambiorix> xmaddness, great thx!
[08:52:42] <pandu101> hi all, i've a "waiting" icon that shows up on my ajax form when user is typing something in. Its triggered via the keyup event. Problem is that if a user just cliks on the form but does NOT type anything, the "waiting" icon just spins and spins non-stop. How could i setup a timer on this "waiting" icon so that it stops after a while?
[08:53:20] <xmaddness> pandu101 setTimeout
[08:54:32] <monkeybite> xmaddness do you know instead of "clicK" event if there is a "change" event for a div?
[08:54:41] <monkeybite> because change does not work for me on a div
[08:55:04] <pandu101> xmaddness: Im using that already to have the script wait .2 secs after the keyup before starting the ajax events.
[08:55:38] <pandu101> Hereis my code --> http://bpaste.net/show/Pc6oOkN2o9BR7FVw6ZNc/
[08:56:28] <pandu101> how would i set the timeout on the "waiting icon" - this is my first jquery attempt, so hazy on things.
[08:58:15] <xmaddness> pandu101: can you put that into a jsfiddle.net please?
[08:58:23] <pandu101> sure
[08:58:33] <xmaddness> monkeybite: there should be
[08:59:01] <xmaddness> monkeybite: http://api.jquery.com/change/
[08:59:17] <monkeybite> xmaddness: look here where I have a "click"-event which works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/19/
[08:59:18] <loostro> hi, i have a serialized object with createdAt property "2010-04-19T00:00:00+0200"
[08:59:20] <loostro> how can i convert this to say... YYYY format?
[08:59:28] <monkeybite> if I change it to "change" it do not work xmaddness
[09:02:46] <xmaddness> monkeybite: http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/20/
[09:03:02] <pandu101> xmaddness: here it is --> http://jsfiddle.net/cPHxf/2/
[09:03:40] <monkeybite> no difference xmaddness? :)
[09:03:55] <pandu101> if you click on the textbok, you'll see an image appears right away... even if you dont type... I want that image to not appear with a click or if it does to go away after a certain period...
[09:03:58] <xmaddness> notice the .change should now be a .on('change', ...
[09:04:30] <monkeybite> $('#secondList').on('change', function () {
[09:04:35] <monkeybite> still aint workin
[09:04:37] <monkeybite> hmm
[09:04:47] <xmaddness> hrmm, maybe I missed your objective then
[09:05:58] <pandu101> xmadness: here is my code if you missed it --> http://jsfiddle.net/cPHxf/2/
[09:06:03] <xmaddness> pandu101: it doesn't appear when I click i nit
[09:06:20] <pandu101> no, it does not cos the img is in my local dev box.
[09:06:29] <rabbi1> providing height: auto to a dialog modal. will not display the dialog at all... :(
[09:06:29] <pandu101> but a broken img icon should appear right?
[09:06:36] <rabbi1> any suggestion?
[09:06:56] <xmaddness> pandu101: no, the broken image does nto appear
[09:06:59] <xmaddness> I am using chrome
[09:07:07] <xmaddness> it appears once I type though
[09:07:35] <jammsen> How does the voting function on facebook work? i can add dynamic inputs, is that possible with jquery???
[09:07:59] <pandu101> wait: my bad. I described it wrong. Sorry. So what happens is that lets say you typed in "cnn.com" and then you backspaced, the waiting img still shows...
[09:08:15] <pandu101> The form basically checks domain availability
[09:08:55] <xmaddness> monkeybite: which div are you refering too
[09:11:14] <xmaddness> pandu101: hrmm, I am thinking you may want to just take the ajax out of the timer. Do the ajax call, and on success, or on error, remove the spinner
[09:12:27] <pandu101> xmadness - here is snapshot of my form - http://i.imgur.com/Ql327.png with that pesky wheel just turning away....
[09:12:38] <pandu101> It just wont stop!
[09:12:50] <jiux> Hi guys
[09:12:55] <rabbi1> oops, auto is a default value
[09:19:30] <shoky> pandu101: does your server not reply or give an error if the input is empty?
[09:20:05] <shoky> here's a more working fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/cPHxf/3/
[09:20:44] <pandu101> Shoky: Thanks. I'm check it out! :)
[09:20:59] <shoky> i didn't really change anything :P
[09:21:19] <shoky> but i did ask you a question ;p
[09:22:31] <pandu101> shoky: kitty is cute. Back to your question. I tried to figure that out but got stuck on that front as well.
[09:23:11] <pandu101> I wanted to see what the server responds with when it fails. But I couldn't access those failure results/codes/whatever.
[09:23:53] <shoky> how come/
[09:24:19] <pandu101> I dunno... cos Im new to this and dont know the things...
[09:24:38] <shoky> if it returns an error then something like this should work:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/cPHxf/4/
[09:24:56] <Sofi-cam> hi im using mi webcam do you wanna see me?
[09:25:15] <shoky> pandu101 do you know the network tab in your browser's developer tools?
[09:25:30] <pandu101> Wow! That looks promising. Yes i know the network tab.
[09:25:37] <pandu101> I haven't look at it much though.
[09:25:50] <shoky> you can see all the requests there including ajax requests
[09:26:03] <shoky> and see their status and response
[09:26:21] <pandu101> Oh cool! hope its not cryptic n stuff. I'll poke around in that.
[09:26:23] <pandu101> Thanks!
[09:26:36] <shoky> it's usually pretty straightforward
[09:26:55] <shoky> but try what i did in my fiddle anyway, might solve your problem
[09:27:09] <pandu101> DAMN! This thing is cool!
[09:27:11] <phonebook_> is there a way to parse the original dom from the dom that has been modified?
[09:27:32] <pandu101> I was using the django terminal and flipping between my browser n the terminal to read the post stuff...
[09:27:40] <pandu101> So much easier!
[09:27:44] <pandu101> Thanks shoky!

[09:30:07] <shoky> ;]
[09:30:26] <phonebook_> it would just be nice to be able to get a reference to the original dom is all
[09:30:54] <phonebook_> or to know for sure if .html was referencing what was happening right now or if it was referencing something in the past
[09:31:06] <shoky> wat
[09:31:15] <phonebook_> .html doesnt always work
[09:31:31] <shoky> does that bother you
[09:31:35] <phonebook_> and the dom changes and so sometimes it would be nice to know what you are referencing
[09:31:45] <phonebook_> of course it bothers me
[09:32:10] <shoky> what doesnt work bout it?
[09:32:18] <phonebook_> for example
[09:32:50] <phonebook_> <textarea>hello world</textarea> --- some dom change <textarea>abc</textarea>
[09:33:10] <phonebook_> sometimes you get the one... sometimes you get the other... that sucks
[09:33:20] <shoky> huh?
[09:33:28] <phonebook_> i can explain nofarther
[09:33:31] <shoky> if you run it before the dom change you'll get the first
[09:33:36] <shoky> if you run it after, you'll get the second
[09:33:50] <shoky> as expected
[09:34:09] <phonebook_> you insist that i provide practicla real world examples?
[09:34:34] <shoky> you said .html is not working
[09:34:43] <shoky> if you want me to believe you, then of course i insist
[09:34:44] <phonebook_> it doesnt, in some cases
[09:34:56] <phonebook_> i cannot provide such examples right now
[09:34:59] <shoky> because what you said so far doesn't show anything not working about it
[09:35:24] <phonebook_> either way the broader point is
[09:35:27] <xmaddness> That is all expected behavior
[09:35:36] <xmaddness> When you call .html, you get the current html
[09:35:45] <phonebook_> i wish they had a way to definitevely reference the original DOM from the exact current DOM
[09:35:55] <xmaddness> that what vars are for
[09:36:02] <xmaddness> var old html = ...
[09:36:09] <shoky> lets also have a definite reference to the DOM 5 minutes ago
[09:36:12] <shoky> and 3.5 minutes ago
[09:36:17] <shoky> and 10 min into the future
[09:36:19] <xmaddness> what about 3.45 mins ago?
[09:36:25] <xmaddness> or 3.441
[09:36:26] <shoky> and just random DOM that we might encounter some day
[09:36:28] <shoky> i want it NOW
[09:36:31] <phonebook_> if its an object its reference by object
[09:36:58] <Goopyo> are there any good tools to turn a long list of dates into a nice multiselect?
[09:39:10] <Kennythehitman> Wow, the documentation for jquery star rating is really crappy
[09:39:16] <Kennythehitman> anyone know a good alternative?
[09:40:11] <phonebook_> $(selector, true) where true = the original DOM and false or null == definitvely get the current value
[09:40:29] <phonebook_> just a bad idea is all
[09:41:40] <phonebook_> because its a huge pain in the ass with jquery mobile and jquery ui enhancing the content and then having no idea what is currently in the dom
[09:43:02] <jonkri> is there some way to "reload" the mouse position, as if the mouse pointer had moved (even if it hasn't), activating any hover functions as necessary
[09:43:04] <shoky> if you really want you can do  var origDOM = $( $('body').html() );  before loading any enhancements :\
[09:43:21] <shoky> that'd just be a copy tho
[09:44:15] <shoky> otherwise you don't need to know what's in the DOM if you've given proper structure to your DOM, with ids & classes
[09:44:25] <shoky> so what if jqui added shit
[09:55:29] <Krambiorix> xmaddness, i have a checkbox in a table column and in that same column other input fields (hidden). how can i get all these input fields in the same column as the checked checkbox?
[09:56:44] <Krambiorix> to everyone now :D , i have a checkbox in a table column and in that same column other input fields (hidden). how can i get all these input fields in the same column as the checked checkbox?
[10:02:59] <quickq> hi all quick question, can jquery's .data() function store a web worker?
[10:12:17] <shoky> quickq: yep, think so
[10:13:44] <Ahrengot> the .data method can retrive values stored in HTML5 data attribute, but is there a way to set the HTML5 data attribute using .data() ?
[10:14:50] <Ahrengot> I'm asking because i need to set a lot of values at the same time, and using data({'val': 'yes', 'otherVal': 'no'}) would be a lot easier than repeating .attr('data-val', 'yes');
[10:16:17] <quickq> thx shoky
[10:16:41] <quickq> well ahrengot
[10:17:48] <quickq> i would have done: var x = []; $('sssssss').data(x); and x.y = value; <- should be automatically stored into the data() as it's by reference. :), this also allows you to add multiple values to storage without calling attr..
[10:21:42] <Ahrengot> I'm sorry, I think my question was unclear.
[10:21:49] <shoky> Ahrengot there's no built-in way
[10:21:58] <Ahrengot> What i want to do is update the HTML5 data attribute in the dom, not fetch the data from it.
[10:22:12] <Ahrengot> Alright shoky, I'll figure something out. Thanks!

The same code is used in both places, the only possible difference (that I can see) is the inclusion point, and the actual jQuery source (1.7.1 via framework assets vs whatever jsFiddle does.)

[10:59:37] <Posterdati> javascript
[11:00:06] <sonotos> loading content via javascript sounds like ajax

[11:08:13] <quickq> raj... isn't the difference that the data is stored in different locations?

[11:13:29] <Alex____> and/or best way
[11:13:59] <jarr0dsz> hey everyone im trying to some preg_match i think with jquery but im not understanding how it works
[11:14:07] <jarr0dsz> any of you experts might want to take a quick peek? http://jsfiddle.net/xQqFw/
[11:14:49] <jarr0dsz> im trying to rewrite the function to using a div instead of href brackets [ ] define a search right? the problem is with my current code it triggers on every single! #block_profile and the orginal code does only the one clicked
[11:17:33] <shoky> raj $.data is more low-level, it's used by $.fn.data. $.data for example doesn't do anything with data-XXX atributes
[11:18:05] <shoky> well it does but only if you first call $.fn.data
[11:18:52] <raj> shoky, very interesting, thank you :)
[11:19:08] <raj> so does $.data() set data-XXX ?
[11:19:22] <shoky> neither of them set data-XXX :p
[11:19:46] <raj> oh, then how does $.data() manipulate/read data-XXX?
[11:20:14] <shoky> $.data doesn't do anything with data-XXX
[11:20:50] <raj> oh, i read your sentence backwards
[11:21:05] <raj> so .data() does something with data-XXX?
[11:21:14] <shoky> it only retrieves them yea
[11:21:19] <raj> i see
[11:21:26] <raj> so what's so low level about $.data()?
[11:21:58] <shoky> it does all the work of actually maintaining the data object for the elements
[11:22:01] <raj> is that the only difference? $.data() is too low-level to do data-XXX?
[11:22:11] <raj> practically speaking
[11:23:29] <shoky> i think that's the main thing that $.fn.data adds, yeah
[11:23:42] <shoky> of course, $.data only works on one element
[11:24:25] <raj> so $('.someclass').data(obj) would work on every .someclass?
[11:24:41] <raj> without using .each()
[11:25:00] <shoky> the .data getter would get it for the first matched element
[11:25:07] <shoky> the setter sets for all matched elements
[11:25:20] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/3F5RG/15/ Can anyone make sense of why removing that twitter thing in <script></script>, in the HTML section, makes none of the code work? http://jsfiddle.net/3F5RG/16/ hows it suddenly not working with the code taken out in <!-- -->
[11:25:53] <raj> understood
[11:25:57] <raj> thanks for the talk shoky :)
[11:26:19] <shoky> np ;]
[11:26:53] <shoky> innociv: you commented the <p> as well
[11:27:17] <innociv> Oh
[11:27:21] <innociv> Why is having that a rquirement, I wonder..
[11:27:42] <shoky> why not
[11:27:48] <shoky> the code in question needs it
[11:30:00] <shoky> innociv without it you get errors in your console
[11:30:13] <shoky> because of scrollorama.animate('#author',{ duration: 10, property:'z-index', end: 0 });
[11:30:39] <innociv> Yeah, I don't know what w is undefined is.
[11:30:54] <innociv> The heck? So this stupid plugin makes errors if you try to apply things to elements that don't exist?
[11:31:21] <innociv> Jquery itself doesn't make errors selecting non existant elements.
[11:32:02] <shoky> seems like it
[11:33:18] <shoky> and innociv you dont have to know what 'w is undefined' is, you just have to look at the exception's stack trace
[11:33:31] <innociv> Yeah.
[11:33:43] <innociv> I kind of assumed a jquery plugin would follow jquery best practices.
[11:36:05] <shoky> well they do say: Disclaimer: This is an experimental, just-for-fun sort of project and hasnít been thoroughly tested
[11:36:16] <shoky> so, your bad :P
[11:39:02] <innociv> Lol.
[11:39:13] <innociv> That's the kind of coding you should never write in the first place, though :p
[11:39:31] <quickq> HI all, i'm having a little problem with the .next(selector) notation, http://jsfiddle.net/Unemt/, could someone please take a quick look?
[11:40:12] <shoky> quickq: what are you trying to do ?
[11:40:24] <shoky> quickq: .next only looks at the next sibling
[11:40:25] <quickq> i want to get the next elem with the div id = 4
[11:40:46] <quickq> without going up or down in the heirarchy, just siblings only
[11:40:47] <shoky> quickq: try nextAll
[11:40:51] <quickq> ah sure ok
[11:40:57] <shoky> (or siblings)
[11:41:07] <shoky> btw
[11:41:22] <quickq> i will try siblings first
[11:41:23] <quickq> thank you
[11:41:25] <shoky> nvm
[11:42:02] <shoky> quickq: you shouldn't be doing that if just selecting by id though
[11:42:06] <quickq> oh?
[11:42:18] <shoky> $('#someId')  is all you need
[11:42:29] <quickq> i'm trying to maximize performance i dont want jquery to look through the entire doc
[11:42:30] <shoky> just like you did with x
[11:42:38] <shoky> jquery is smarter than you
[11:42:43] <quickq> loool
[11:42:44] <shoky> $('#someId') is as fast as it gets
[11:42:47] <quickq> so they have an id table?
[11:42:47] <quickq> dang ok
[11:42:49] <shoky> no
[11:42:50] <shoky> the browser does
[11:42:59] <quickq> interesting, i didn't know that
[11:43:00] <shoky> and jquery taps on to that
[11:43:15] <quickq> interesting i will google that
[11:43:43] <quickq> or if you have a url regarding that information, that would be helpful :)
[11:43:54] <shoky> well
[11:44:06] <shoky> jquery just uses document.getElementById
[11:44:17] <shoky> ?mdn getElementById
[11:44:19] <bot-t> shoky, jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library - http://jquery.com/
[11:44:22] <shoky> ?mdc getElementById
[11:44:27] <bot-t> shoky, document.getElementById - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a reference to the element by its ID . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.getElementById
[11:44:42] <quickq> intresting, ok
[11:44:46] <quickq> i forgot about that :D
[11:44:52] <quickq> i wonder which is faster.... :p
[11:45:24] <shoky> use $('#someId') , you won't regret it :P
[11:45:36] <quickq> ok, thx shoky
[11:46:32] <jb_gfx> Hi :)
[12:06:54] <Posterdati> is there any experienced jquerist? I need help to make galleriffic works in a jquery dialog, please help... Thanks
[12:08:34] <dabear_> is anyone here good with chrome dev tools? is there something more granular than "break on subtree modifications"? E.g. I want to only break when a div with specific id is added to the body
[12:13:29] <Cameron__> how can i trigger an event on the change of the css background colour of a div??
[12:13:31] <danheberden> $(document).on('DOMNodeInserted', function(e){ if ( e.id === "theIDYouWant" )...
[12:13:59] <danheberden> Cameron__: fire an event when you change it?
[12:14:03] <Cameron__> yeah
[12:14:09] <danheberden> no, like, that's the answer
[12:14:15] <Cameron__> oh
[12:14:16] <Cameron__> but how?
[12:14:20] <danheberden> ?trigger
[12:14:21] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:14:47] <danheberden> dabear_: not chrome dev tools specific, but ^^
[12:15:05] <dabear_> danheberden: need to run it on dom load
[12:15:06] <dabear_> hmm
[12:15:12] <dabear_> before*
[12:15:23] <dabear_> this is an external site, not under my control
[12:15:24] <Cameron__> is there no way to listen for when the css is changed?
[12:15:27] <danheberden> that should still work before the document is loaded
[12:15:33] <danheberden> because you can still bind to document
[12:15:48] <danheberden> Cameron__: not like that - that'd be a lot of overhead for the browser
[12:15:58] <danheberden> but you can listen for the behaviour that would change it
[12:16:06] <Cameron__> mm
[12:16:09] <danheberden> e.g. hover, click, or setting a new class yourself
[12:23:46] <novochar> if you specify async: false for the ajax method, will all the functions within success: function (data) {//these functions} execute synchronously as well?
[12:26:56] <novochar> how can i go about verifying that it is executing in either style?
[12:27:38] <danheberden> i would never, ever use async: false
[12:28:00] <danheberden> it's more that the following code won't run until the request complete
[12:28:01] <danheberden> *s
[12:28:23] <danheberden> stuff in the success function or resulting promise function run when the ajax request is complete
[12:28:47] <danheberden> e.g. $.ajax({ url: 'someurl' }).done( function( data ) { /* your returned data is here */ });
[12:29:07] <danheberden> == $.ajax({ url: 'someurl', success: function( data ) { /* your returned data is here */ });
[12:30:33] <novochar> is it ran synchronously or asynchronously?
[12:30:33] <shoky> Posterdati: this is a start http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ZE8QT/
[12:31:17] <shoky> Posterdati: i.e. you just put it in the dialog, nothing special you have to do (except styling)
[12:33:01] <LoneStar991> monkbite
[12:33:07] <Posterdati> shoky: I did a simple page copied from a galleriffic demo, it works as stand alone page, but if I make load it in a dialog it won't work
[12:33:16] <LoneStar991> monkeybite did you get the code working?
[12:33:19] <shoky> Posterdati: hence my fiddle
[12:33:29] <monkeybite> LoneStar991
[12:33:52] <monkeybite> latest version here http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/20/
[12:33:55] <Posterdati> shoky: ah thanks
[12:34:12] <Posterdati> I'll try to use it, I'm at the very beginning
[12:34:40] <shoky> i just copiedd from their demo too
[12:35:15] <Posterdati> shoky: I used load in click event
[12:35:23] <Posterdati> to load the html page
[12:36:31] <LoneStar991> monkeybite: sweet!
[12:36:40] <shoky> then maybe you need to initialize the plugin after loading new html
[12:36:49] <Posterdati> shoky:  I understood it you put the galleriffic in the dialog div, ok!
[12:36:54] <shoky> yap
[12:43:08] <eager> greetings, new here
[12:43:21] <eager> new to jquery too
[12:46:47] <eager> idea please, how could my console.log("anything"); ruin the execution of my callbacks?
[12:47:09] <eager> if I comment them out the code works fine
[12:47:36] <BinaryKitten> which browser?
[12:47:46] <eager> and it occurs only in IE7-9, and tested in firefox 3.6
[12:47:53] <BinaryKitten> yep
[12:48:02] <BinaryKitten> IE doesn't have a console object
[12:48:08] <eager> webkits dont have any problem
[12:48:14] <BinaryKitten> so it will die as soon as it hits those lines
[12:48:29] <eager> wow, im really new then :)
[12:48:38] <BinaryKitten> also firefox doesn't have console either unless you have firebug installed
[12:48:56] <eager> so do I have to remove every console.log() befor putting he code to production?
[12:49:02] <eager> simple as that?
[12:49:04] <tw2113> actually firefox does now
[12:49:08] <BinaryKitten> yes definitely
[12:49:20] <BinaryKitten> tw2113 it does since which version?
[12:49:22] <eager> thank you a million!
[12:49:33] <eager> i was debugging for hours :DD
[12:49:36] <tw2113> it may not be in stable quite yet, but the dev channels have many new dev tools
[12:49:42] <ui> http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cdndevs/archive/2012/01/03/10168757.aspx
[12:49:53] <ui> but it says nothing for IE < 9
[12:49:57] <eager> you are proven right because
[12:50:04] <tw2113> http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/07/debugger-responsive-design-view-and-more-in-firefox-aurora-15/
[12:50:35] <eager> if firebug was running upon loadin the page, also F12 dev tools in IE9, the code worked fine
[12:50:53] <eager> as soon as not having firebug at load the code failed
[12:51:10] <BinaryKitten> welcome to the world of js debugging eager
[12:51:12] <MistuhKurtz> eager, you should define a console.log function
[12:51:13] <eager> it's a pleasure to know, thanks again!
[12:51:33] <BinaryKitten> eager MistuhKurtz is right
[12:51:37] <tw2113> also https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Tools BinaryKitten
[12:51:39] <tw2113> :D
[12:52:02] <BinaryKitten> if (!console) { console = { log: alert}; }
[12:52:10] <MistuhKurtz> if (typeof console.log == undefined){ console = { log: function(){ }}; }
[12:52:12] <MistuhKurtz> or something like that
[12:52:16] <eager> define a console log function‚Ä¶ how should it look like? any tut or URL so that I can see howz it look like?
[12:52:36] <eager> ah i can see - slow typing :)
[12:52:47] <MistuhKurtz> I think you would want to check with typeof wouldn't you, BinaryKitten ?
[12:53:03] <ui> why would he?
[12:53:11] <BinaryKitten> she please
[12:53:18] <eager> :)
[12:53:18] * BinaryKitten aint no guy :p
[12:53:19] <ui> sorry
[12:53:30] <MistuhKurtz> Because if it's undefined it will throw an error unless you're checking with typeof
[12:53:41] <MistuhKurtz> right?
[12:53:47] <BinaryKitten> ?tias
[12:53:47] <bot-t> Try It And See
[12:53:59] <MistuhKurtz> eager can try it and see :P
[12:53:59] <ui> true
[12:54:05] <MistuhKurtz> and report back
[12:54:11] <ui> just tried in Chrome
[12:54:22] <MistuhKurtz> well it's gonna be defined in chrome so you won't have a problem
[12:54:46] <ui> 'if (!adkfbvavkl)' throws ReferenceError, so you were true, sorry :p
[12:55:15] <MistuhKurtz> ah ya
[12:55:27] <eager> i cant catch up with this fast a process - i need to find again my desktops and editors and everyting :)
[12:55:50] <eager> but ill try - step by step :)
[12:57:07] <tw2113> web development has a habit of keeping no one completely uptodate
[12:58:04] <MistuhKurtz> so did you figure out the empty console log function, eager ?
[12:59:10] <BinaryKitten> MistuhKurtz also undefined needs to be quoted
[12:59:21] <BinaryKitten> and damn you can't point log direct to alert like that
[12:59:23] <BinaryKitten> :(
[12:59:27] <BinaryKitten> if (typeof bob === 'undefined') { bob = {log:function(msg) {alert(msg); }}; }
[12:59:32] <eager> MistuhKurtz: i have just copied and "prettyprinted" your code above‚Ä¶ I'll run it now
[12:59:34] <BinaryKitten> bob being console
[13:00:03] <ui> BinaryKitten: why can't point log directly to alert?
[13:00:16] <shoky> console = console || {log:function(){}}
[13:00:24] <MistuhKurtz> what do you mean you can't pass it to alert? what you typed out should work perfectly BinaryKitten
[13:00:30] <shoky> don't alert :\ if the devtools are closed you dont wanna log anyway.
[13:00:30] <BinaryKitten> ul TypeError: Illegal invocation
[13:00:50] <BinaryKitten> {log:alert} === TypeError: Illegal invocation
[13:00:54] <BinaryKitten> when calling
[13:01:03] <MistuhKurtz> but I tried that once and found that I don't want it to use alert(), the whole point of log was to output data without interrupting the js script
[13:01:13] <BinaryKitten> shoky, nice
[13:01:25] <MistuhKurtz> oh, yeah, you can't quite do it like that
[13:01:42] <BinaryKitten> MistuhKurtz yeah but if it's not available how are you going to do so quickly
[13:01:55] <MistuhKurtz> what shoky just typed is nice and succinct :D
[13:01:59] <eager> MistuhKurtz: I have used your code above without modifying it, with no luck - callback with a console.log within fails
[13:02:00] <MistuhKurtz> Forgot about that way
[13:02:49] <MistuhKurtz> eager, isolate the problem and create a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net
[13:03:00] <MistuhKurtz> and I will gladly check it & correct it if I can :D
[13:07:25] <eager> MistuhKurtz: I would need to mash up some demo, but I ont feel capable enough for that right now‚Ä¶ I have a really tough day behind me and melting in a hot and noisy pup right now (no net at home), so i'll get satisfied with commenting out my console.logs for now :)
[13:07:50] <MistuhKurtz> aw c'mon eager :P
[13:08:01] <MistuhKurtz> all you have to paste is the console.log code
[13:08:28] <eager> okay‚Ä¶ well
[13:09:04] <MistuhKurtz> console = console || { log:function(){ }};
[13:09:11] <MistuhKurtz> that's all you need, that's what shoky wrote
[13:09:32] <eager> trying...
[13:09:48] <MistuhKurtz> console = console (if already defined), otherwise it = log: function (){ }
[13:12:22] <ui> just do Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V
[13:12:47] <jrockjiggz> Hi, i was wondering if I could get some help using Ben Alman's Hash Change plugin. the problem is I'm using Divs not Anchors.. and the plugin gets the hash from the Href=""
[13:13:30] <ui> id="string to be hashed"
[13:13:50] <MistuhKurtz> jrockjiggz, well then you need to trigger the custom hashchange event
[13:14:19] <MistuhKurtz> can you isolate your problem and put it on http://jsfiddle.net ?
[13:14:46] <jrockjiggz> yes i'll try to
[13:26:19] <eager> MistuhKurtz: http://jsfiddle.net/awyWs/3/
[13:26:53] <eager> it doesnt work, im not familiar with jsfiddle site, should i link the jquery lib too?
[13:27:07] <eager> or is it included on that site?
[13:27:41] <MistuhKurtz> well for one thing, it might help if you selected 'jquery' instead of 'mootools' for your library ;)
[13:28:03] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/awyWs/5/
[13:29:21] <eager> okay, thanks, so the thing you uncommented - placed in my code should make it all operable in firefox 3.6?
[13:29:31] <eager> tats the goal
[13:30:35] <MistuhKurtz> whoops it wasn't working in IE
[13:30:37] <MistuhKurtz> here this works http://jsfiddle.net/awyWs/6/
[13:31:14] <jrockjiggz> Hash problem here: http://jsfiddle.net/MsYap/  (doesn't work)
[13:32:26] <k1ng_> atags = $('body').text().match(/\d{6}/g);
[13:32:26] <k1ng_> $.each(atags , function(k, v){  });
[13:32:27] <eager> MistuhKurtz: THANK YOU for educating me!
[13:32:30] <eager> :D
[13:32:46] <k1ng_> any idea why i am getting Cannot read property 'length' of null
[13:33:15] <k1ng_> typeof(atags)
[13:33:15] <k1ng_> "object"
[13:34:34] <MistuhKurtz> haha sure eager
[13:34:45] <MistuhKurtz> remember to put a "var" in front when you're defining a variable
[13:35:13] <eager> yes, that one i will
[13:35:47] <eager> in two weeks i can at least double my competence,
[13:36:08] <jrockjiggz> any helps. ?
[13:36:24] <eager> as i do jquery for 2 weeks only
[13:37:39] <MistuhKurtz> jrockjiggz, i'm looking at it
[13:40:18] <MistuhKurtz> jrockjiggz, here's my implementation of jQuery BBQ: http://comps.gunnjerkens.com/brookfield-sd/quiz.html
[13:41:33] <jrockjiggz> MistuhKurtz: I see you are using anchors.. i think this is my issue
[13:44:22] <MistuhKurtz> jrockjiggz, you're binding the hashchange event inside of click(function(){ ... });
[13:44:25] <MistuhKurtz> it needs to be outside
[13:45:32] <apocalipso> hi all, how I can access selector object inside function? I mean $('selector').change(function(){ > here < i need know selector value, but no luck with googling (miss keywords maybe)..
[13:46:16] <eager> $(this).val()
[13:46:18] <eager> ?
[13:46:31] <jrockjiggz> MistuhKurtz: can you give an example? I also changed them to anchors.. (do not really want to do this) http://jsfiddle.net/MsYap/1/
[13:47:15] <Posterdati> shoky: didn't work :(
[13:47:41] <apocalipso> eager, thanks!
[13:48:18] <MistuhKurtz> $.param.fragment() is undefined for some reason
[13:48:19] <MistuhKurtz> hold on
[13:50:30] <MistuhKurtz> jrockjiggz, http://jsfiddle.net/MsYap/5/
[13:50:55] <MistuhKurtz> I got rid of the hashchange plugin and used the BBQ plugin by Ben Alman
[13:51:15] <jrockjiggz> MistuhKurtz: thanks man, i've been fighting this for a while. i have had no idea. haha
[13:51:34] <MistuhKurtz> BBQ is a more fully-featured plugin
[13:51:52] <MistuhKurtz> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[13:52:07] <MistuhKurtz> is it working properly jrockjiggz ?
[13:56:07] <MistuhKurtz> jrockjiggz, I updated the comments to explain what's going on: http://jsfiddle.net/MsYap/6/
[13:56:12] <jrockjiggz> it's perfect thanks :)
[13:56:17] <jrockjiggz> looking
[13:57:03] <MistuhKurtz> Ben Alman makes some nice plugins, I've used $.postMessage and $.bbq before
[13:59:26] <MistuhKurtz> How you like my little animated quiz? :P
[14:00:48] <Posterdati> shoky: :(
[14:01:07] <shoky> it give eror :[
[14:01:15] <Posterdati> no
[14:01:19] <shoky> ?eror
[14:01:21] <eager> thanks for everything, see you later...
[14:01:21] <bot-t> shoky, Couldn't find "eror" in jQuery Docs.
[14:01:22] <thomedy> im brushing up on my calculus right now to write a ssolid easing function
[14:01:33] <shoky> bot-t, eror is it give eror
[14:01:34] <bot-t> shoky, Stored "eror".

[14:01:37] <bot-t> it give eror
[14:02:20] <gnech> fiddle diddle learn me some javascriptle
[14:03:29] <shoky> Posterdati: pretty much the same way you do in a fiddle. remember to put a $(document).ready(function() { ... }); around your codez
[14:03:55] <Posterdati> which code? all the javascript in the fiddle?
[14:04:35] <Mark____> hi
[14:04:50] <shoky> Posterdati: you need to include jquery and jqui and galerrific...
[14:05:02] <shoky> Posterdati: yes all the javascript
[14:05:21] <Posterdati> I included them
[14:05:23] <Mark____> can someone help me?   i try to fetch teh autocomplete event which triggers AFTER selecting an element.   Cause i want to prevent from auto-fillout the input
[14:05:27] <Mark____> any clues?
[14:05:51] <Posterdati> shoky: dialog opens but it is empty
[14:06:27] <MistuhKurtz> Mark____, you can add this attribute to your input element: autocomplete="off"
[14:06:44] <Posterdati> shoky: I enclosed the html code in <body> ... </body> tags
[14:06:53] <Mark____> gonna try...   wait a sec  :D
[14:07:50] <Posterdati> shoky: and put the css in a file
[14:08:02] <Posterdati> <link rel="stylesheet" href="dialog.css" type="text/css" media="all"/>
[14:08:03] <Mark____> dotn works , as i thought..
[14:08:11] <Mark____> i meant i use jquery-autocomplete
[14:08:33] <Mark____> i think teh html-attrbute "autocomplete" prevents from browser auto-fillout
[14:09:18] <Mark____> my Problem was encured by using jquery-ui-autocomplete
[14:09:44] <shoky> Posterdati: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ZE8QT/1/
[14:12:43] <Mark____> Posted my current code WITH question as Comment at jsfiddle:   http://jsfiddle.net/3xzfU/
[14:12:50] <Posterdati> shoky: worked
[14:12:53] <Posterdati> shoky: thanks
[14:14:21] <Posterdati> shoky: I put the css and javascript in separate files
[14:15:21] <Posterdati> shoky: thanks again
[14:17:59] <shoky> np
[14:20:28] <shoky> Mark____: one way is with setTimeout like this: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/LWw7F/
[14:20:47] <shoky> there's prolly a better way
[14:29:48] <Posterdati> shoky: thanks
[14:36:21] <lmatteis> guys really quickly
[14:36:28] <lmatteis> how do i match an element with an empty attribute?
[14:36:33] <lmatteis> [name=""] doesn't work
[14:37:51] <shoky> lmatteis: it works
[14:38:24] <lmatteis> shoky: doesn't for me
[14:38:32] <shoky> lmatteis: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TVmDg/
[14:39:43] <lmatteis> shoky: ah thanks
[14:42:36] <MistuhKurtz> lmatteis, what about $("input[name]")
[14:42:53] <lmatteis> ugh why
[14:43:20] <MistuhKurtz> ah nm
[14:43:28] <MistuhKurtz> that would select any element with a name attribute, whether it's empty or not
[14:53:27] <jenia> hello everyone.
[14:53:41] <jenia> i need to load some html into my page
[14:53:59] <jenia> when i use ("#some_div").load("some_html.html")
[14:54:17] <jenia> then html is not being loaded until the whole script is executed
[14:54:47] <jenia> like the html does not appear in the page until after the end of execution of my whole call back function
[14:55:09] <jenia> so when i do $('#some_div').load("bla.html")
[14:55:33] <jenia> and then i cannot actually use it cause it not in the page until after the whole script is executed
[14:55:59] <jenia> can anyone indicate to me how to avoid this problem?
[14:57:39] <shoky> jenia: if you pass a callback to .load it'll only get called after the html was inserted
[14:57:47] <danheberden> jenia: put the html in there in the first place
[14:58:02] <jenia> oh yea. haha thanks very much
[14:58:40] <jenia> shoky i didnt forget about what you;ve asked me: to tell you if i figure out why the debuffer constantly stops
[14:58:58] <jenia> i dont know if its the problem but i'm thinking i know why:
[14:59:09] <shoky> hmm, seems i've forgotten tho ;P
[14:59:11] <jenia> this debugger is for chome developper not web developpers
[14:59:13] <jenia> haha
[14:59:33] <jenia> my debugger stop execution for some dom exception 12 error
[14:59:40] <jenia> and i dont know why
[14:59:53] <jenia> in firefox it gives css exeptions only
[14:59:57] <shoky> yea i recall now, sorta
[15:00:13] <jenia> i think its cause my debugger is for chrome developpers not for javascript or web developpers
[15:00:31] <shoky> donno what you mean
[15:00:41] <shoky> 'my debugger is for chrome developers' ??
[15:00:55] <jenia> its for developping plugins for chrome or something
[15:01:01] <shoky> what debugger
[15:01:10] <jenia> im using the default console that comes with chrome
[15:01:16] <shoky> yea
[15:01:29] <jenia> is it for developping web apps or for writing plugins for chrome?
[15:01:50] <shoky> it's for any client-side web development
[15:02:29] <jenia> humm well for some reason it stops execution for some ' dom exception 12'
[15:02:48] <jenia> and firefox's firebug doesnt. it just tells me that there are css errors
[15:03:11] <shoky> ya didn't we find you just had some css error and that was the problem?
[15:03:16] <shoky> dont remember ;S
[15:03:37] <shoky> nvm
[15:05:18] <jenia> yea. thats probably what it is
[15:05:26] <jenia> thanks shoky and danheberden
[15:19:22] <raj> shoky holdin' it down
[15:25:41] <felipe_Brz> guys is there a large performance overhead if I load lots of little js files
[15:25:47] <felipe_Brz> rather than one BIG one
[15:25:55] <felipe_Brz> ?
[15:27:06] <zim> Hi all.  I have a .on question can I bind it to an <input> get and lose focus ?
[15:27:26] <systemfault> felipe_Brz: A high number of HTTP requests is probably worse than having big js files
[15:27:51] <systemfault> zim: Yeah.. focus and blur
[15:28:55] <zim> systemfault: ty so just $('#site_wrappper').on('focus', '.input_class', function () {
[15:29:41] <systemfault> zim: Blame the jquery devs for merging event handler with event delegation (That was a stupid move)
[15:30:04] <systemfault> zim: If you use event delegation, take a look at the focusin and focusout events
[15:30:19] <felipe_Brz> systemfault:  i see.... i'm trying to weigh out the benefits of having lots of little js file with can be included in varying orders (think of mixins) VS the overhead due to having lots of little files
[15:30:42] <zim> systemfault: will it work with elements loaded with ajax?
[15:30:51] <systemfault> zim: It should.
[15:31:44] <zim> just things like .click don't and .live is breing replaced by .on
[15:32:12] <systemfault> zim: Yeah .on is does it all
[15:32:22] <zim> ty
[15:33:44] <Mark____> LOOOOL
[15:33:46] <Mark____> guyz
[15:33:58] <Mark____> listen:   i tried to fix a problem for about 30 mins
[15:34:08] <Mark____> it ends up that i misstyped "onclick"
[15:34:14] <Mark____> i wrote "onlick" instead  :D
[15:34:21] <Mark____> no joke  xD
[15:37:26] <shoky> sop raj
[15:37:52] <raj> coolin, just watching Rampart
[15:37:52] <ircjsbot> The CSS goes ok, but the jQuery doesn't with the PHP $strings.
[15:42:17] <shoky> ah ive seen that, not bad

[15:45:13] <shoky> ;S
[15:56:19] <zim> Hi all. is it possible to .serialize() a form element rather than a form i.e.    $(this).serialize() where this is an <input>
[16:02:09] <zim> ^^^ Yes answered my own question
[16:03:44] <tw2113> go you
[16:18:51] <zim> is it possible to .post an array ?
[16:20:07] <zim> $.post('index.php', post_data, function (data){ where post_data is an array
[16:21:51] <jehe> I am building a upload script, and now am suppose to send the <input file> value with $.ajax to the proper .php file. However, is var file = $('#input').val() enough?
[16:23:50] <zim> jehe: almost what I am doing. try this
[16:24:13] <jehe> I am listening
[16:25:32] <zim> $.post('index.php', $('selector').serialize(), function (data){ do something with the response });
[16:26:48] <jehe> what is serialize?
[16:26:50] <CpuID> hey ppls... if im pulling in some content using .ajax() (just to fill a div basically), but i want to tack some event handlers onto elements in the ajax result, whats my best option there? ideally id love to just provide a <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"> block in the ajax result with another .ready() in it, but in theory I would be overwriting the page's .ready if i did that right?
[16:27:36] <CpuID> ...i dont really want to pull in all the events in the main html output, but instead pull them in with the ajax results and have them applied there
[16:28:38] <CpuID> oh hang on a second... http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Multiple_$(document).ready() my bad :)
[16:29:52] <jehe> zim: Data from file select elements is not serialized.
[16:33:21] <zim> jehe: I know it will serialize for posting
[16:51:05] <jehe> zim however files cannot be sent with ajax I just learned
[16:51:15] <jehe> which makes everything so much more complicated
[16:52:20] <zim> jehe: they must be able to?? not 100% how well I have no idea how but sites like facebook do
[16:52:43] <jehe> no, they are not. Facebook use PHP for that I bet
[16:52:58] <jehe> the ajax active a php script, it doesnt send the file per say
[16:53:16] <zim> ajax is client side php is client side
[16:53:25] <zim> ajax is client side php is cserver side
[16:53:27] <jehe> php is not client side
[16:53:47] <systemfault> The classic hack around that limitation is to use a hidden iframe.
[16:53:52] <zim> I know !! typo it was the point I was trying to make lol
[16:54:06] <jehe> I hate iframes
[16:54:10] <jehe> I cant explain how much I hate them
[16:55:06] <systemfault> If you want an example.. see how the jquery iframe transport plugin does it.
[16:55:17] <jehe> systemfault: if I have a upload script purely on PHP. Can I call it without having to refresh the page?
[16:56:00] <felipe_Brz> jehe:  yes that's wht ppl call AJAX
[16:56:15] <jehe> yeah but then again. How do I send the file to the PHP file?
[16:56:29] <felipe_Brz> you don't really send files, but data
[16:56:46] <felipe_Brz> you send data via a GET request or a POST request
[16:56:58] <systemfault> jehe: Learn to use an hidden iframe to do it...
[16:57:07] <jehe> please no iframes :D
[16:57:39] <systemfault> jehe: Then you're stuck with flash‚Ä¶ or xhr2+file api only on really recent browsers
[16:57:51] <systemfault> jehe: It's not like you have a choice here.
[16:59:24] <felipe_Brz> systemfault:  can't he serialize the file and send it as data?
[16:59:32] <jehe> no
[16:59:38] <jehe> file cant be serialized
[16:59:50] <systemfault> felipe_Brz: Nope.
[17:04:35] <MistuhKurtz> hm
[17:04:41] <MistuhKurtz> why do I see jQuery plugins starting with this:
[17:04:42] <MistuhKurtz> ;(function($) {
[17:04:50] <MistuhKurtz> What's the purpose of the ; ?
[17:05:33] <systemfault> MistuhKurtz: In case the other library is not well done..
[17:06:20] <systemfault> If it doesn't have a terminating semi-colon, your whole module might be parsed as a function call..
[17:10:02] <MistuhKurtz> I see systemfault, thanks for the explanation
[17:10:30] <MistuhKurtz> So that's not syntactically incorrect if the ";" isn't needed after all?
[17:10:48] <systemfault> MistuhKurtz: The ; isn't needed at all.
[17:11:31] <MistuhKurtz> I mean, if it ends up that you don't need the ";" then it doesn't throw a syntax error?
[17:11:56] <systemfault> No
[17:12:06] <systemfault> ?js ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
[17:12:10] <bot-t> systemfault: undefined
[17:12:17] <systemfault> See‚Ä¶ it's valid
[17:12:30] <systemfault> Semi-colons are optional in JS..
[17:12:49] <systemfault> But not using them is often seen as being a bad pattern.
[17:13:54] <systemfault> Personally, I don't mind, as long as your code is wrapped into a module and it has a ; at the end.
[17:22:01] <Gambit-> anyone use jqgrid a lot, here?
[17:25:47] <Whirl3d_> Good evening. I have written a constrcutor function to create an object. Then I extend the function's prototype to include several methods. However, when I do this, it's evaluating the functions and returning an error based on the undefined scope of the the new methods...
[17:26:26] <Whirl3d_> How does one define methods for an object's prototype?
[17:27:10] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/YghVy/10/
[17:28:36] <hye> What approach is better for better compatability in desktop and mobile phones.  Heavy javascript calculations or server side ajax calculations?
[17:29:00] <Whirl3d_> depends on the situation
[17:29:27] <rmurphey> Whirl3d_: var MyConstructor = function() { ... }; MyConstructor.prototype.methodName = function() { ... }
[17:29:48] <hye> Whirl3d_ I like javascript because it won't throttle the bandwidth, but ajax is better because if the script takes too long to process, it can be just as useless
[17:29:49] <Gambit-> I lean more towards loading the computationally intensive work on the serverside, especially if there's a remote chance it can be reused.
[17:30:09] <Whirl3d_> rmuphey, thanks for the reply. Why can't I combine multiple methods into an object and use $.extend to extend the prototype?
[17:30:59] <hye> Gambit- essentially i am iterating over thousands of checkboxes several passes over, doing it front-end is slow i am afraid on mobile phones it will give problems.  but then the downside of ajax is that mobile phones will need to send and recieve data on each checkbox change
[17:31:06] <rmurphey> Whirl3d_: your fiddle has a whole lot of extraneous detail, if you want to put together a simple example of what you're trying to do i can take a look
[17:31:07] <innociv> http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrollorama/ Is there a plugin like this that works on scrolling divs?  I know I could modify the source to make this one work, but I want one that already exists.
[17:31:38] <Whirl3d_> sure. I'll just eliminate 9/10s of the methods. brb
[17:32:13] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/YghVy/11/
[17:32:22] <MistuhKurtz> Thanks for the explanation systemfault :)
[17:32:27] <Whirl3d_> So I just kept the first method in my sectionAPI object
[17:33:17] <rmurphey> Whirl3d_: you're calling new section with two args
[17:33:24] <rmurphey> but the definition of section only expects one
[17:33:26] <Whirl3d_> lol. I just realized that
[17:33:35] <rmurphey> and then you're calling init with no args
[17:33:37] <rmurphey> but expecting two
[17:33:51] <Whirl3d_> I couldn't make up my mind if I wanted to assign the properties with init or in the constructor
[17:34:32] <rmurphey> i'd suggest simplifying this into something that is as utterly basic as possible
[17:34:51] <rmurphey> var MyConstructor = function() { ... }; $.extend(MyConstructor.prototype, someOtherObj);
[17:34:54] <rmurphey> and see if it works :)
[17:35:11] <Gambit---> ugh, stupid crash
[17:35:22] <rmurphey> that is, get rid of all of the details that are clouding the working/not working
[17:35:29] <rmurphey> get the bare bones working, and then add your stuff
[17:35:50] <Whirl3d_> Cool enough. Thanks for your advice.
[17:37:22] <rmurphey> Whirl3d_: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/3H888/
[17:37:57] <tw2113> *waves*
[17:55:09] <shoky> Whirl3d_ hey, your sectionBindings extension doesn't make much sense to me
[17:55:23] <shoky> whacha tryin to do there?
[17:56:03] <Whirl3d_> I removed it. I was going to make it so that you could bind a couple methods to the element that would trigger events on the prototype.
[17:56:22] <Gambit---> anyone here use portlets with jqgrid?
[17:57:22] <Whirl3d_> So I planned to have a "private variable" for currentPage that you could access by $("element").trigger("setCurrent") to make that element the "currentPage"
[17:57:51] <zim> Is there a callback for .effect ?
[17:58:11] <Whirl3d_> I was basically planning to create a subset of methods that I could easily loop through and bind to my elements for access in the dom.
[17:58:31] <Whirl3d_> So buttons could say $("page").trigger("nextPage")   to show the next page
[17:59:18] <Whirl3d_> Hey shoky!
[18:02:02] <shoky> hey :P
[18:03:03] <imsky> ba da ba ba baaa
[18:03:24] <shoky> moo moo ungh
[18:04:43] <shoky> zim: yes
[18:05:05] <raj> if I $.post('/somewhere', {'myarray':[]}) is that supposed to show up without 'myarray' serverside?
[18:05:38] <zim> shoky: TY worked it out should have tried before asking just there is nothing about it in the doc.
[18:05:48] <shoky> zim sure there is
[18:06:00] <shoky> http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/#option-options
[18:06:39] <shoky> raj: why without?
[18:06:50] <raj> i dunno, that key isn't showing up
[18:06:54] <raj> maybe I need to jsonify it?
[18:07:15] <zim> shoky: ty was looking at the wrong doc http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Highlight
[18:07:21] <shoky> i donno, what does your serverside expect
[18:07:30] <raj> oh
[18:07:30] <raj> hm
[18:08:47] <shoky> wait your array is empty?
[18:10:45] <imsky> ?js []
[18:10:49] <bot-t> imsky: []
[18:10:53] <zim> TY all night night.
[18:10:55] <imsky> man bot-t you're getting old
[18:10:57] <imsky> and slow
[18:12:58] <shoky> raj yea an empty array won't be serialized
[18:13:42] <raj> k, guess I'll have to JSON.stringify it
[18:14:28] <shoky> hmm
[18:17:13] <jeffbaier> Hi I was looking for some help on an Internet explorer 8 problem
[18:17:17] <jeffbaier> and jquery.on
[18:17:29] <shoky> and now?
[18:20:55] <imsky> AND NOW I MUST ROCK OUT
[18:20:58] <bwq> hi
[18:21:04] <imsky> what do you want
[18:21:08] <bwq> for some reason, .on() doesn't do anything for me :/
[18:21:18] <imsky> it's because you're ugly
[18:21:22] <bwq> ah ok
[18:21:34] <imsky> tech support's getting easier
[18:22:05] <bwq> i mean really
[18:22:06] <bwq> $("td").on("click", function(){
[18:22:07] <bwq>         alert('ok');
[18:22:07] <bwq>     });
[18:22:10] <bwq> why doesn't this work
[18:22:15] <bwq> :<
[18:22:21] <bwq> not even getting an error
[18:22:24] <bwq> just nothing
[18:22:27] <imsky> you're delegating
[18:22:28] <imsky> DELEGATING
[18:22:54] <imsky> don't attach events to every single td
[18:23:04] <imsky> $("table").on("click", "td", function(){})
[18:23:21] <bwq> yeah, it's just for testing
[18:23:28] <bwq> but it doesn't work
[18:23:45] <bwq> if i attach it after i got at least a single td, it works fine
[18:23:57] <bwq> but not if it's declared before i inject the table
[18:24:06] <bwq> but that's kinda the whole point of on() right?
[18:24:13] <shoky> bwq only if you use it right
[18:24:21] <bwq> being able to attach itself to elements that aren't created yet
[18:24:33] <shoky> .on like you used it is identical to .click(
[18:24:42] <imsky> bwq http://jsfiddle.net/nStYd/
[18:25:00] <jeffbaier> I am having a problem with Internet Explorer 8 and bootstrap-dropdown. Using IE 8, view my jsfiddle -- http://jsfiddle.net/jeffbaier/RFPsg/ -- in the result pane pane, scroll all the way to the bottom and click the link. it will go to a 404 (not relevant). Now click the back button in your browser. When the page goes back it will jump to the top of the content. This is not the expected behavior. In other browsers it goes back to the bottom of the page.
[18:25:00] <imsky> never mind just read that you don't understand how the DOM works
[18:25:01] <jeffbaier> Basically where you were when you clicked the link and navigated away.
[18:25:02] <jeffbaier> I have narrowed down the issue to this line near the bottom of bootstrap-dropdown.js
[18:25:04] <jeffbaier> $('html')
[18:25:05] <jeffbaier>     .on('click.dropdown.data-api', clearMenus)
[18:25:05] <jeffbaier> Removing that gets the expected behavior, except then the drop downs don't work quite right. Any ideas for me? Thanks!
[18:25:08] <imsky> JEFF HOLY SHIT
[18:25:25] <jeffbaier> yeah sorry
[18:25:39] <jeffbaier> i copied and pasted from writing it up in the bootstrap irc
[18:25:41] <jeffbaier> no one's around there tho
[18:25:43] <bwq> shoky: so how do i use it properly then?
[18:25:51] <jeffbaier> figured since its query issue probably, you guys could help
[18:25:56] <shoky> bwq: read about event delegation. see ?on
[18:25:57] <bot-t> bwq, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:26:06] <bwq> k wait, lemme try
[18:26:07] <shoky> bwq: imsky already told you how to use it properly
[18:26:07] <imsky> shoky, how you like being op?
[18:26:16] <shoky> i'm an op?
[18:26:21] <imsky> you're not?
[18:26:28] <imsky> must have been one hell of a party
[18:26:37] <shoky> i was for a few hours, sure ;P
[18:26:42] <bwq> i screwed up the syntax lol
[18:26:45] <imsky> don't toy with me shoky
[18:26:53] <bwq> so in the end
[18:26:55] <bwq> i'm not ugly
[18:26:57] <bwq> you suck!
[18:26:58] <shoky> me can't re-oppy
[18:27:01] <imsky> yes you are bwq
[18:27:03] <imsky> ugly and stupid
[18:27:05] <shoky> so me no oppy
[18:27:06] <bwq> nope :D
[18:27:13] <imsky> you're basically shrek
[18:27:23] <bwq> so you are always supposed to attach it to an already existing element
[18:27:28] <imsky> no.
[18:27:30] <imsky> jesus christ
[18:27:31] <shoky> yes
[18:27:32] <bwq> and from there add the elements you want to propagate it to
[18:27:38] <imsky> no
[18:27:41] <shoky> maybe
[18:27:42] <bwq> yes
[18:27:44] <bwq> it works now
[18:27:47] <imsky> you can delegate up to the document
[18:27:55] <bwq> how?
[18:27:55] <imsky> which isn't an always existing "element"
[18:27:56] <jeffbaier> Does anyone even have IE8 anymore. lol. i had trouble finding a test machine for myself
[18:28:12] <imsky> jeffbaier, everyone with ie9 has it
[18:28:18] <shoky> bwq you should only ever run jquery methods (such as .on) on elements that exist
[18:28:32] <jeffbaier> imsky: oh? how does that work. i'm a mac user so forgive my ignorance
[18:28:45] <bwq> gotcha shoky
[18:28:56] <imsky> jeffbaier, don't worry about it. you're on a mac, surrounded by a moat of unix
[18:29:06] <bwq> so what's imsky talking about? :p
[18:29:11] <bwq> being able to delegate up to the document
[18:29:15] <imsky> bwq the .on way of doing .live
[18:29:17] <jeffbaier> unfortunately the quivering masses still use IE8, hence my issue
[18:29:18] <imsky> it's all in docs
[18:29:19] <shoky> bwq: the document is an element that exists, no?
[18:29:26] <bwq> just attach it to the doc and then work from there i guess?
[18:29:26] <imsky> NO
[18:29:28] <imsky> dammit shoky
[18:29:32] <imsky> :(
[18:29:37] <imsky> spreading your lies
[18:29:37] <shoky> ;< wat
[18:29:38] <ircjsbot> Unlike all you, I'm waiting to see the great boom! The mistery will be revealed and it is on the Revolution's controller pad.
[18:29:45] <shoky> tf
[18:29:48] <imsky> ;<
[18:29:50] <bwq> who dat
[18:30:03] <imsky> markov chains, nature's miracle
[18:30:11] <imsky> anyway jeffbaier let me pull up ie real quick
[18:30:25] <Deluxor> hello guys someone there pro in JSON?
[18:30:27] <jeffbaier> ok thanks
[18:30:32] <imsky> Deluxor, i'm pro in everything
[18:30:39] <bwq> me too Deluxor
[18:30:40] <bwq> sup?
[18:30:52] <imsky> bwq doesn't know anything about jquery
[18:30:55] <Deluxor> well will explain 1 sec
[18:30:58] <imsky> don't listen to his lies
[18:31:08] <bwq> he come on, i've never used .on before :D
[18:31:09] <shoky> just passed muh json certification exams
[18:31:14] <bwq> kk, i read the docs in less than 1 min :(
[18:31:15] <imsky> JSON MCSE
[18:31:27] <jeffbaier> JSON+ certified
[18:31:37] <bwq> well
[18:31:44] <bwq> it just so happens i wrote bwqJSON
[18:31:50] <imsky> jeffbaier, ie8 goes back to the bottom
[18:31:54] <bwq> you might've heard of it if you work at Google
[18:32:02] <imsky> i work at google, never heard of it
[18:32:12] <shoky> tsssss
[18:32:14] <bwq> no way
[18:32:25] <bwq> everyone's migrating
[18:32:32] <jeffbaier> imsky: with that jsfiddle i pasted, it goes back to the bottom when you click back button?
[18:32:39] <imsky> jeffbaier, that's right
[18:32:54] <jeffbaier> imsky: well thats a serious wtf. stand by
[18:33:01] <imsky> ROGER THAT CAPTAIN
[18:33:13] <imsky> !function ($) {
[18:33:18] <imsky> lol how much more hipster can you get
[18:33:21] <bwq> Deluxor: make sure you set the dataType of the ajax call to json
[18:33:22] <bwq> np
[18:33:33] <jeffbaier> imsky: did you have compatibility view on?
[18:33:46] <Deluxor> just a sec gf on phone --'
[18:33:47] <imsky> jeffbaier, who exactly has compatibility view on
[18:34:07] <jeffbaier> imsky: well it worked in jsfiddle just now when i tried it with compat view on, but not with it off
[18:34:50] <imsky> there isn't even a button for compat view anymore
[18:35:01] <jeffbaier> ie8?
[18:35:07] <imsky> ie9 acting as ie8
[18:35:14] <imsky> also why are you checking compat view
[18:35:19] <imsky> that's quirks mode garbage
[18:35:19] <jeffbaier> i have no idea
[18:35:24] <jeffbaier> i never use IE
[18:35:28] <systemfault> Compatibility view isn't quirks mode...
[18:35:29] <jeffbaier> just covering my bases here
[18:35:35] <systemfault> It's IE7 in IE8..
[18:36:00] <systemfault> With IE9, you can switch to IE7 or IE8 mode with the dev tools F12
[18:36:09] <imsky> IE only displays this button when toggling into Compatibility View makes sense, such as when viewing Standards mode pages. In all other cases, such as when viewing Quirks mode pages or viewing intranet sites (they‚Äôre already being displayed in Compatibility View as discussed later in this post), IE hides the button.
[18:36:18] <imsky> hurr dur
[18:36:38] <jeffbaier> when i view my jsfiddle page in IE8 the compat view button is available
[18:36:53] <jeffbaier> if i enable it, it works. disabled it does not
[18:37:12] <imsky> jeffbaier, safe to say you don't need to worry about it
[18:37:31] <jeffbaier> yes i do
[18:37:40] <jeffbaier> i had reports from my crappy IE8 users
[18:37:46] <jeffbaier> i hunted down an old xp laptop with ie8
[18:37:48] <jeffbaier> and am testing it
[18:37:53] <Deluxor> Ok im here again
[18:37:56] <Deluxor> so
[18:37:58] <jeffbaier> i narrowed down the problem to the query code in bootstrap
[18:38:05] <Deluxor> I have a question about JSON and PHP
[18:38:15] <jeffbaier> sorry, my irc client keeps autocorrecting jquery to query
[18:38:30] <Deluxor> bwq
[18:38:35] <Deluxor> please look at this http://xp.pt-bit.com/jh.php
[18:38:37] <imsky> jeffbaier, apple software
[18:38:44] <systemfault> imsky: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/askie/archive/2009/03/23/understanding-compatibility-modes-in-internet-explorer-8.aspx
[18:38:48] <Deluxor> i am using var_dump
[18:38:52] <systemfault> imsky: Learnz0r
[18:39:02] <imsky> systemfault, i knew you'd sperg out and find EVIDENCE FOR YOUR RIGHTFULNESS
[18:39:05] <Deluxor> how can I extract "normal" output of json
[18:39:11] <imsky> loling at your greasy nerding out
[18:39:19] <systemfault> imsky: Or for my wrongness..
[18:39:31] <imsky> systemfault, check #peoplewhocare for people who care
[18:39:38] <imsky> i hear there's a whole reception for you
[18:39:55] <jeffbaier> is there cake?
[18:39:59] <imsky> so much cake
[18:40:01] <Deluxor> people ? please help me in this
[18:40:10] <bwq> extract normal output?
[18:40:19] <bwq> you aren't really outputting as json
[18:40:28] <bwq> to parse json, you need to output some json first :p
[18:40:39] <Deluxor> yeah how?
[18:40:45] <bwq> json_encode
[18:40:52] <Deluxor> i am output this with php var_dump function
[18:40:54] <imsky> jeffbaier, speaking of that greasy nerd finding, just set X-UA-Compatible to ie8 standards
[18:41:05] <imsky> never worry about compatibility view again
[18:41:13] <bwq> what are you dumping Deluxor?
[18:41:17] <imsky> toxic waste
[18:41:18] <bwq> which array?
[18:41:21] <systemfault> imsky: Remember what I said about idiots like you should be killed on sight? ;) I still think it.
[18:41:21] <bwq> lol
[18:41:31] <systemfault> imsky: You're a disservice to the community
[18:41:37] <Deluxor> well var_dump($api->call("system.getJavaMemoryTotal"));
[18:41:48] <imsky> systemfault, don't you have an episode of my little pony to watch
[18:41:48] <ircjsbot> is there a way to charge a plugin inside the main file?
[18:41:50] <Deluxor> it is a minecraft json api
[18:42:02] <Deluxor> to push some info from server
[18:42:03] <systemfault> imsky: Unfortunately‚Ä¶ not
[18:42:05] <bwq> so try json_encode($api->call("fzefzef")
[18:42:10] <bwq> and echo that
[18:42:16] <bwq> see if you get a nice json string
[18:42:20] <imsky> "i still stand by my creepy homicidal statements from a week ago"
[18:42:23] <imsky> GOOD JOB WEIRDO
[18:42:32] <Deluxor> hmm ok lets try
[18:43:31] <Deluxor> :DDDD
[18:43:32] <Deluxor> http://xp.pt-bit.com/jh.php
[18:43:32] <jeffbaier> ok the ie8 mode meta tag did not fix it
[18:43:36] <Deluxor> you are tha best M8
[18:43:38] <Deluxor> !!!
[18:43:45] <imsky> jeffbaier, too bad
[18:43:58] <jeffbaier> compatibility mode is not the issue, its a jquery issue with ie8 specifically i think
[18:44:09] <imsky> if it is, i don't see it
[18:44:11] <Deluxor> bwq thank you very much !
[18:44:16] <Deluxor> just works perfectly
[18:44:20] <jeffbaier> imsky: well you're not using ie8
[18:44:28] <bwq> np
[18:46:13] * imsky thinks about hypersensitive nerds and how they got so screwed up
[18:46:20] * imsky ponders
[18:46:46] <Deluxor> bwq look the result that i want: http://xp.pt-bit.com/jh.php
[18:47:12] <jeffbaier> Does anyone have IE8 to test an issue for me?
[18:49:00] <bwq> get it with an ajax call or w/e and then you can just use var['memory'] etc.
[18:49:56] <Deluxor> kinda confused i am new to ajax
[18:50:16] <bwq> you use jquery, right?
[18:51:17] <Deluxor> no at the moment i am output directly using php
[18:51:33] <bwq> yeah i know
[18:51:38] <bwq> but your front-end web app or w/e
[18:52:00] <Deluxor> well i don't use but I would
[18:52:06] <LoneStar99> good evening folks
[18:52:09] <Deluxor> I know some inner works
[18:52:14] <shoky> jeffbaier: ya
[18:52:31] <imsky> hahaah playboy.com
[18:52:34] <jeffbaier> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/jeffbaier/RFPsg/
[18:52:36] <imsky> bahaha
[18:52:57] <LoneStar99> any reason why a function works outside of "$(document).ready(function() {..}); but does not work when place inside??
[18:53:21] <bwq> here Deluxor
[18:53:21] <bwq> http://jsfiddle.net/6sNWr/
[18:53:35] <shoky> jeffbaier: what about it?
[18:53:46] <Deluxor> ohh
[18:54:00] <jeffbaier> shoky: refresh i added my commentary to the top of the html
[18:54:09] <bwq> see the /search?
[18:54:10] <shoky> refresh?
[18:54:15] <bwq> replace that with your php page
[18:54:26] <jeffbaier> shoky: refresh my jsfiddle
[18:54:35] <bwq> then you just POST w/e you want to the php, grab the vars you need and output the json
[18:54:42] <shoky> jeffbaier: click update and give me a new link. jsfiddle doesnt work that way
[18:54:47] <jeffbaier> yes it does
[18:54:49] <bwq> when you get the json back, you can use it like in that sample
[18:54:56] <jeffbaier> i made the new version the "base"
[18:54:57] <jeffbaier> http://jsfiddle.net/jeffbaier/RFPsg/
[18:55:18] <shoky> i refreshed.
[18:55:45] <shoky> what now?
[18:55:55] <jeffbaier> you don't see my instructions at the top of the results pane, under the drop down menu?
[18:55:58] <Deluxor> bwq but is this content well structured? http://xp.pt-bit.com/jh.php
[18:56:09] <shoky> jeffbaier: UPDATE and give me a link, please :\
[18:56:25] <bwq> yes Deluxor
[18:56:43] <Deluxor> ok replaced the /search but when i run it it bugs
[18:56:49] <Deluxor> well does nothign
[18:56:54] <Deluxor> nothing*
[18:56:54] <jeffbaier> shoky: i don't know what to tell you, i'm looking at this url on two different machines http://jsfiddle.net/jeffbaier/RFPsg/ -- and its what i'm saying. what do you not see?
[18:57:33] <bwq> you added the $(function() right?
[18:57:39] <bwq> to load your jquery stuff
[18:57:45] <shoky> ah. i was looking at the top of your HTML part
[18:57:53] <shoky> not the result
[18:58:09] <jeffbaier> shoky: oh ok sorry. lemme know how it works for you. thanks
[18:58:18] <Deluxor> well i am not using jquery lol
[18:59:09] <shoky> jeffbaier it didn't jump up
[18:59:35] <bwq> lol
[18:59:44] <bwq> you can use that
[18:59:49] <bwq> should be easy to parse your results
[19:00:08] <Deluxor> but this function you sent me
[19:00:11] <jeffbaier> shoky: you're in ie8, not in compatibility mode, right?
[19:00:18] <shoky> ya
[19:00:32] <Deluxor> it searches and output the result right?
[19:00:36] <bwq> for single results that aren't in a list you can just use jsonvar.var btw
[19:00:39] <bwq> yeah it does
[19:00:51] <jeffbaier> shoky: what version of ie8, and what version of windows?
[19:01:07] <Deluxor> bwq can you look at PM more easy
[19:01:23] <bwq> it does a POST to the /search url with params search = search
[19:01:27] <bwq> k
[19:01:28] <shoky> IE 8.0.6001.18702  winxp
[19:01:41] <imsky> forgot the xp build, shoky
[19:01:52] <shoky> indeed
[19:03:35] <jeffbaier> ok guys thanks for testing
[19:03:44] <jeffbaier> idk why the fuck this isn't working for me
[19:03:44] <imsky> jeffbaier, still think i didn't run ie8?
[19:03:55] <jeffbaier> imsky: you told me you don't run ie8
[19:03:59] <jeffbaier> imsky: you run ie9
[19:04:03] <imsky> ie9 in ie8 mode
[19:04:20] <jeffbaier> imsky: do you blame me for trying to test it on raw ie8?
[19:04:33] <imsky> not really, you're probably closer to the real environment where the bugs appear
[19:04:39] <imsky> but i doubt it's got anything to do with anchors
[19:05:04] <jeffbaier> its just this that breaks it
[19:05:04] <jeffbaier> $('html')
[19:05:05] <jeffbaier>     .on('click.dropdown.data-api', clearMenus)
[19:05:15] <imsky> have you checked clearMenus?
[19:05:16] <jeffbaier> any ideas at all for potential ie8 problems?
[19:05:35] <jeffbaier> hmm no
[19:05:37] <jeffbaier> i'll dig into that
[19:20:20] <jrockjiggz> I have a weird problem. when i load a page in by ajax, and use fragments to only get the element I want.. the javascript inside doesn't run.. even if the <script></script> tags are inside the element.
[19:20:24] <jrockjiggz> not sure what to google..
[19:22:24] <imsky> you load fragments of javascript in html?
[19:24:05] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: You cannot load JS with innerHTML (What .html() probably uses internally)
[19:24:16] <systemfault> You need to eval it :/
[19:24:41] <imsky> :\
[19:25:05] <digs> I am trying to use a jQuery selector to pass to the errorPlacement option of jQuery.validate() and am completely unsuccessful.
[19:26:08] <digs> http://dev.fdanconia.com/los/register -- I want to replace the descriptions of those fields with the error message. The descriptions look like this... <div class="description">First Name*</div>
[19:26:58] <digs> So, I need to select the first instance of the class 'description' after the form element that was just validated... am I thinking the right way?
[19:30:01] <systemfault> Yes
[19:30:24] <digs> How do I do that?
[19:30:32] <digs> Because I cannot seem to accomplish this.
[19:31:01] <systemfault> digs: jQuery('#theInputId').siblings('.description'); ?
[19:33:44] <digs> systemfault, let me see.
[19:38:14] <jeffbaier> hey guys i'm back
[19:38:20] <jeffbaier> i think i messed up the jsfiddle last time we were testing
[19:38:25] <jeffbaier> anyone able to test ie8 again for me ?
[19:38:29] <jeffbaier> http://jsfiddle.net/jeffbaier/RFPsg/
[19:42:37] <quizme> hi
[19:43:04] <quizme> how do you select all children elements ?
[19:46:30] <systemfault> .children()
[19:49:21] <shoky> jeffbaier: it jumped up now
[19:49:30] <jeffbaier> shoky: yes!
[19:49:39] <jeffbaier> shoky: i'm not crazy! i'm just bad at jsfiddle
[19:50:01] <hugleo> Hi
[19:52:32] <hugleo> Hi. When I enter on a TextAre I would like the window scroll to entered TextArea. Do you anybody can help?
[20:00:52] <Space-Duck> Anyone know hwy this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/37CJs/
[20:06:13] <teear> Sponge Bob
[20:10:29] <shoky> Space-Duck: you're not supposed to bind the click yourself
[20:11:34] <shoky> Space-Duck: maybe someth like this http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/VfEyp/
[20:12:04] <shoky> btw you can use .data('copy') instead of .attr('data-copy')
[20:12:58] <jeffbaier> shoky: any ideas?
[20:13:31] <shoky> jeffbaier: nope, i wasn't following at all, just tested for you ;p
[20:13:48] <jeffbaier> shoky: are you knowledgable in hquery?
[20:13:52] <jeffbaier> jquery
[20:14:03] <shoky> guess so
[20:15:53] <jeffbaier> shoky: its just that one section thats causing the problem. any idea why?
[20:17:35] <shoky> no, but first step would be to isolate the issue
[20:17:56] <shoky> and i donno bootstrap at all, dono how i can help
[20:18:26] <jeffbaier> i isolated the issue
[20:18:55] <shoky> it doesnt happen if that dropdown isn't there?
[20:19:16] <jeffbaier> http://jsfiddle.net/jeffbaier/RFPsg/2/
[20:20:17] <jeffbaier> i just removed     $('html')
[20:20:18] <jeffbaier>       .on('click.dropdown.data-api', clearMenus)
[20:20:20] <jeffbaier> down at the bottom
[20:20:23] <jrockjiggz> I have a global function, it runs onDomReady and on ajax.complete(). the problem is I can't let this run on the same elements twice or it messes up.  not sure how to handle this (function needs to run on every page and be automatic to every ajax call
[20:24:53] <jeffbaier> shoky: its not a bootstrap specific thing. the problem is just a jquery plugin
[20:26:41] <jeffbaier>     getParent($(toggle))
[20:26:41] <jeffbaier>       .removeClass('open')
[20:26:44] <jeffbaier> that line specifically
[20:32:46] <tw2113> evening shoky
[20:32:53] <tw2113> or whatever time it is there
[20:44:32] <hugleo> /quit
[20:45:20] <shoky> 6:45am
[20:45:26] <shoky> hai tw2113
[20:45:37] <shoky> jeffbaier: sorry, no clue
[20:45:47] <jeffbaier> shoky: k thanks anyway
[20:50:55] <RudyValencia> Does anyone know of a simple jQuery windowing UI? I'm trying to implement one for a project I'm working on.
[20:54:36] <robert_> RudyValencia and I are working on a project where we need to implement a simple, stackable (I guess?) windowing UI for a group of 4 or so windows; we don't need close functionality; just the ability to move windows around and stack them on-top of other widgets.
[20:56:16] <Space-Duck> shoky, any idean why this fails? http://jsfiddle.net/VfEyp/3/
[21:01:38] <shoky> Space-Duck: you need to load the swf from the same domain
[21:07:24] <RudyValencia> Can jQuery UI be themed differently than the standard themes/themeroller allow for?
[21:29:42] <engaged> I have 2 classes defined that both have border-color... I do a check to validate form input and if it isn't valid I apply the 2nd class... however the border-color is not working (background-color is)... so one is on input {} and one is .error {}  how do I get the .error class to over ride when I assign ti via jquery?
[21:54:06] <wavez> I am trying to understand $.getJSON().
[21:54:09] <wavez> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[21:54:14] <wavez> http://www.jquery4u.com/json/ajaxjquery-getjson-simple/
[21:54:21] <wavez> what is this 'map' thing?
[21:54:42] <wavez> "data ñ A map or string that is sent to the server with the request."
[21:54:59] <wavez> "Data that is sent to the server is appended to the URL as a query string. If the value of the data parameter is an object (map), it is converted to a string and url-encoded before it is appended to the URL."
[21:55:04] <wavez> ^ I don't understand.
[21:55:16] <wavez> What is it for? What purpose does this serve?
[21:56:07] <jcubic> if it's object like {"foo": "bar"} and you have url http://server.com it send url http://server.com?foo=bar
[21:56:31] <wavez> So this is just a convenience feature?
[21:57:39] <jcubic> for GET yes, but for POST it send after your request
[21:57:46] <wavez> jcubic, that is SO MUCH better of an explanation. I don't understand why people can't just freaking Keep It Simple.
[21:57:51] <wavez> ahh, okay, that makes sense.
[21:58:20] <tw2113> keep it simple like javascript is?
[21:58:27] <wavez> ha
[21:58:33] <wavez> How do I tell it if I want to use Get or Post?
[21:59:06] <jcubic> use $.get or $.post or $.ajax({ type: 'get' or 'post'
[21:59:17] <wavez> ahh
[21:59:30] <tw2113> getJSON is just a wrapper of $.ajax() anyway
[21:59:36] <jcubic> $.get and $.post are shortcuts
[22:00:05] <jcubic> getScript too
[22:08:36] <Stephen> evening folks
[22:08:44] <Stephen> someone tell me something cool
[22:09:32] <jcubic> Stephen: http://www.stableflow.com/articles/jquery/10-cool-things-with-jquery/
[22:09:42] <tw2113> something cool, Stephen
[22:09:54] <tw2113> ice
[22:10:08] <tw2113> shoky's social life
[22:11:25] <Stephen> oooo... that's a burn
[22:11:28] <Stephen> not cool.
[22:11:55] <tw2113> at least i didn't claim sex life
[22:12:05] <Stephen> neither does he.
[22:12:44] <Stephen> I need a good looking way to do something along the lines of a paralax scrolling desert
[22:13:14] <Stephen> But using a horizontally tileable png just looks ugly, and it's huge
[22:39:59] <jeffbaier> I fixed my issue from earlier. https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/4033
[22:40:00] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #4033 on bootstrap (jeffbaier; 35m, 21s ago): Back button issue in IE 8 with bootstrap-dropdown.js
[22:50:23] <Gambit-> anyone use any kind of signal/slot mechanism?
[22:51:27] <systemfault> We all do..
[22:51:43] <Gambit-> is there documentation you can point me at?
[22:52:05] <systemfault> See the "Observer pattern".. it's also often called "pub/sub"
[22:52:35] <systemfault> (Publisher/subscriber)
[22:52:52] <Gambit-> I'm familiar with the pattern, I just haven't found the "here's how you do it" for jquery/jquerui/jqgrid
[22:53:22] <systemfault> You can easily make your own events with jquery
[22:53:41] <Gambit-> oh, so, it's roll-your-own, then?
[22:53:49] <systemfault> $(someNode).trigger('rofl');
[22:54:00] <systemfault> That would "fire" an rofl event.
[22:54:25] <systemfault> So if you have some listeners, they would trigger
[22:54:38] <systemfault> $(someNode).on('rofl', function() {alert('lol'); });
[22:54:42] <Gambit-> but someone would have to bind on my specific object
[22:55:07] <systemfault> You don't want someone to bind to some widget?
[22:55:16] <Gambit-> no, because the widget may or may not be present.
[22:55:20] <systemfault> You need something more like a mediator
[22:55:25] <Gambit-> or it may be sourced by another widget.
[22:55:37] <Gambit-> yeah
[22:55:39] <systemfault> Then Backbone.Event might be what you want
[22:55:45] <systemfault> (See backbone.js)
[22:55:57] <Gambit-> is... that a file in the jquery distribution?
[22:56:11] <systemfault> No, it's a javascript MVC
[22:56:32] <Gambit-> hm
[22:56:35] <systemfault> It's 6k gzipped..
[22:56:35] <jcubic> Gambit-: var foo = {}; $(foo).bind('x', function() { console.log('x'); }); $(foo).trigger('x')
[22:56:56] <Gambit-> jcubic, there would be a loading order dependency on that, though, I would think.
[22:57:08] <Gambit-> which isn't egregious, I suppose.
[22:58:25] <Gambit-> I'll read up on what backbone.js gives me.
[22:58:38] <systemfault> jcubic's idea isn't bad
[22:58:43] <Gambit-> but having a single global that all of those events fire on seems pretty reasonable.
[22:59:03] <systemfault> I didn't know that jQuery supported event on anything but DOM nodes
[23:00:57] <Stephen> systemfault: Any object can have an event on it
[23:01:50] <Gambit-> ah, always the event parameter followed by whatever other parameters there are.
[23:02:22] <Gambit-> is there an equivilent unbind()?
[23:02:32] <systemfault> Gambit-: Don't use bind
[23:02:37] <systemfault> Gambit-: use .on and .off
[23:02:45] <Stephen> .on()
[23:02:45] <systemfault> (.off is to unbind)
[23:02:48] <Gambit-> All of the examples use bind() :/
[23:03:13] <systemfault> Gambit-: Then change the word 'bind' to 'on', you save two characters!
[23:03:15] <systemfault> Weee!
[23:03:17] <Gambit-> :)
[23:03:26] <Gambit-> why one and not the other?
[23:03:32] <wavez> after using $.getJSON(), I can't use $.parseJSON()?
[23:03:38] <systemfault> Gambit-: .bind is being deprecated
[23:04:02] <Gambit-> gotcha
[23:04:02] <systemfault> wavez: getJSON parses the JSON, what you get at the end is a JS object
[23:05:25] <wavez> systemfault, Okay. I took the output from getJSON and put it in console.log(). It looks right, but I don't know how to access the branches and nodes from there.
[23:05:58] <Gambit-> is there some kind of hierarchy to js objects I should be using, or should I just create at the top level a var gambitsEventRoot = {} for everyone to register events onto?
[23:05:59] <systemfault> wavez: It's a javascript object.. then access it like one
[23:06:25] <jcubic> wavez: response.foo.bar or reponse['foo']['bar']
[23:06:33] <systemfault> Gambit-: I would declare it at the top level inside a "module"
[23:06:53] <wavez> Ya, that's what I tried. I printed data[0] and got undefined.
[23:07:31] <wavez> the first level has 3 branches
[23:08:43] <wavez> Oh, I see what I have to do. I don't get why, but I see what it wants now.
[23:09:01] <jcubic> wavez: are you returing an array or object
[23:09:11] <wavez> it returns an object
[23:09:19] <wavez> as var data
[23:09:31] <wavez> so then I do data.tables[0] and I get the first branch
[23:10:00] <Gambit-> systemfault, so something like var EventRoot = (function (eh) { $(eh).on("monkey", function() { console.log("hello world"); } ); }(EventRoot));?
[23:11:10] <systemfault> Gambit-: It doesn't make sense :/
[23:11:27] <systemfault> EventRoot would be undefined after.
[23:11:44] <Gambit-> oh, whups
[23:11:49] <Gambit-> + retrun eh;
[23:12:07] <Gambit-> var EventRoot = (function (eh) { $(eh).on("monkey", function() { console.log("hello world"); } return eh; ); }(EventRoot));?
[23:12:09] <jcubic> var EventRoot = (function (eh) {
[23:12:09] <jcubic>           $(eh).on("monkey", function() { console.log("hello world"); } ); return eh;
[23:12:09] <jcubic>           }({}));
[23:12:22] <systemfault> ^^
[23:12:49] <Gambit-> don't you need to pass in the EventRoot so that if the ordering changes you don't kill the previous version of the object/
[23:13:02] <shubham> hi
[23:13:07] <Dustin> Hi there, just curious how I would go about implementing a jquery show / hide toggle for multiple list items. IE: toggle list item a, drops down, if you click list item b, list item a hides, and b drops down
[23:13:17] <systemfault> Gambit-: The EventRoot that you first pass to the function doesn't exists
[23:13:25] <jcubic> Gambit-: I think it still will not work since EventRoot will be no object you need to pass {} to that function
[23:13:26] <Gambit-> var EventRoot = (function (eh) { $(eh).on("monkey", function() { console.log("hello world"); } return eh; ); }(EventRoot || {}));?
[23:13:54] <shubham> how can i use java script to get lkes on my page...?
[23:14:00] <systemfault> Gambit-: That would work
[23:14:24] <shubham> wat?
[23:14:25] <ircjsbot> Why doesn'y apache compile my jquerry?
[23:14:29] <Gambit-> is thta what you had in mind when you said insider a module?
[23:14:51] <jcubic> ircjsbot: because apache is not javascript compiler
[23:14:58] <systemfault> ircjsbot: For the same reason that C++ doesn't work on a PHP interpreter
[23:15:17] <shubham> hi
[23:15:24] <Gambit-> systemfault, nothing works on a php interpreter, *ba-dum-chich*
[23:15:46] <shubham> any 1 can help me?>
[23:16:19] <jcubic> shubham: you need to explain what help you need
[23:16:33] <systemfault> Gambit-: I had in mind : (function(module) {  var foo = ${{}};  program here  })(window); but you're good
[23:16:43] <Gambit-> ah okay
[23:16:45] <systemfault> Gambit-: Haha :D
[23:17:08] <shubham> i had seen many peoples using java script for getting likes
[23:17:18] <shubham> can i know how they do it?
[23:17:38] <jcubic> shubham: what likes?
[23:17:44] <systemfault> shubham: Go to the dev section of facebook and learn how to use their SDK...
[23:17:56] <shubham> in facebook likes
[23:19:16] <Dustin> Hi there, just curious how I would go about implementing a jquery show / hide toggle for multiple list items. IE: toggle list item a, drops down, if you click list item b, list item a hides, and b drops down
[23:19:47] <jrockjiggz> how do I check if parent is $('ul.tabs') ?
[23:20:28] <jcubic> jrockjiggz:  if ($(this).parent('ul.tabs').length) {
[23:20:29] <systemfault> jrockjiggz: something like if (myNode.parent().is('ul.tabs')) IIRC
[23:20:45] <jrockjiggz> systemfault: thanks
[23:22:47] <Gambit-> var EventRoot = (function (eh) { $(eh).on("monkey", function() { console.log("hello world"); } return eh; ); }(EventRoot || {}));?hrm
[23:22:56] <Gambit-> =whups, sorry.
[23:23:53] <Gambit-> systemfault, I'm getting a "no method 'on'" error, but 'bind' works
[23:25:32] <Gambit-> jquery 1.4.2 and jquery ui 1.8.2
[23:28:57] <systemfault> Gambit-: That's why, jQuery 1.4.2 is prehistoric :P
[23:29:04] <systemfault> 1.7.2 is the latest
[23:29:08] <systemfault> And .on is 1.7.x
[23:29:21] <systemfault> Use .bind if you cannot update
[23:29:28] <Gambit-> hah
[23:29:34] <Gambit-> I should be able to update
[23:36:41] <Gambit---> argh
[23:56:44] <jrockjiggz> Hi, could someone help me figure a way to re-order elements? http://jsfiddle.net/XMCn3/3/
[23:59:20] <jrockjiggz> added comment (i'd like to use $(this) as the sort key http://jsfiddle.net/XMCn3/4/
