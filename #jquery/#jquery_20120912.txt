[00:03:30] <coldhead> sriyani: please create a simple demo of what you want to do on jsfiddle and we will try to help you
[00:03:35] <coldhead> until we get bored
[00:03:45] <coldhead> then we will pretend we've fallen asleep
[00:17:58] <coldhead> sriyani: it was nice talking to you, best wishes for the rest of your life
[00:21:59] <arielserafini> offtopic: anyone here use a IRC proxy?
[00:25:17] <coldhead> lot of people like irccloud here, arielserafini
[00:25:26] <coldhead> and ZNC
[00:25:33] <coldhead> that the kind of thing?
[00:26:11] <arielserafini> yup
[00:26:39] <arielserafini> i'm looking to set up something on my server
[00:26:52] <arielserafini> i'm running irssi-proxy right now
[00:27:10] <arielserafini> will look into ZNC later
[00:27:22] <arielserafini> irccloud looks nice, but it's subscription based
[00:27:35] <arielserafini> when it leaves beta anyway
[00:27:56] <coldhead> oh yes irssi is popular too
[00:28:01] <coldhead> but web people love their web irc
[00:28:10] <coldhead> weirdos
[00:28:26] <greek> Hey fellas. I'm having a strange issue with jquery UI and z-index (or at least I think it's z-index). I have a draggable list of elements and just below I have tabs. I am dragging the elements into a droppable inside of the tabs. However when dragging an element, the currently dragged element appears under the tabs. In other words it doesn't get dragged on-top / over the tabs. I've tried setting the respective z-indices of both the draggabl
[00:28:27] <greek> e and the tabs to no avail. Any ideas?
[00:28:44] <arielserafini> whoa, that's a huge block of text :)
[00:28:51] <greek> sorry :)
[00:29:00] <coldhead> that sounds pretty z-indexy
[00:29:02] <ravenzz> arielserafini ask for a irc cloak
[00:29:16] <ravenzz> why do you need a proxy btw?
[00:29:27] <coldhead> for teh secret privacy
[00:29:36] <arielserafini> multiple devices
[00:29:37] <coldhead> und zie bouncing
[00:30:03] <ravenzz> coldhead privacy of wat
[00:30:21] <arielserafini> greek: i'm not that knowledgeable on jquery UI, sorry
[00:30:31] <ravenzz> connect in ssl + a cloak is just fine
[00:30:43] <ravenzz> you are not selling drugs on irc i hope lol
[00:30:49] <arielserafini> greek: can you make a jsfiddle?
[00:31:07] <greek> arielser_, yeah I guess, give me a few minutes please
[00:31:20] <greek> arielserafini i mean
[00:31:59] <coldhead> greek: it's probably one of those times when you need to set the z-index for a parent as well as the child you care about
[00:32:18] <coldhead> possibly the tabs are position:relative and so don't heed z-indexes
[00:32:23] <coldhead> possibly some other tragedy
[00:34:03] <coldhead> little brown jug
[00:34:33] <greek> coldhead, I didn't know position:relative did that, I'll check it out thanks
[00:35:43] <coldhead> good luck greeksy
[00:36:07] <coppa> hi there
[00:36:17] <coldhead> gday coppa
[00:36:23] <coppa> hello coldhead
[00:36:28] <coldhead> hi!
[00:37:39] <coldhead> coppa: it was good chatting with you. i have to go now. bye
[00:37:45] <coppa> eh eh eh
[00:37:46] <coppa> ok
[00:37:57] <coppa> I'll keep the house safe
[00:38:46] <coldhead> thanks coppa
[00:40:13] <rgr> playing with jquery json stuff. If in the browser console I do 'x=[];x.f1=1;x.f2=2;' how come JSON.stringifiy(x) returns an empty array? I gues something totally basic I'm missing this early morning.
[00:41:49] <coldhead> it's JSON, not JSAN
[00:41:52] <coldhead> objects, not arrays
[00:42:18] <arielserafini> that's not even an array
[00:42:19] <arielserafini> :P
[00:42:50] <rgr> ok, can you give the 101 on this please. I keep finding examples which switch between them trough some sort of implicit conversion
[00:43:19] <coldhead> you can use array notation to access object keys
[00:43:30] <coldhead> so foo.bar or foo['bar']
[00:43:35] <arielserafini> a JSON should look just like an object literal: {firstValue: 100, secondValue: "some string}
[00:43:38] <arielserafini> oops
[00:43:46] <arielserafini> a JSON should look just like an object literal: { firstValue: 100, secondValue: "some string" }
[00:44:42] <rgr> please excuse me, I'm at a tender point here (too much hacking and not enough sitting down to learn the basics properly) ... thanks
[00:45:07] <arielserafini> so according to your example
[00:45:20] <arielserafini> you could do something like x = {};
[00:45:39] <rgr> oh right. yup. googling throws this up a lot. thanks for yor time.
[00:45:41] <arielserafini> and then set the properties using x.propertyName = "value"';
[00:46:05] <rgr> (I still think its bloody confusing and easily mixed up but thats probably just me ;))
[00:46:07] <coldhead> the only reason to confuse them is because you CAN use array notation to access object properties
[00:46:12] <rgr> ah right
[00:46:22] <coldhead> arrays do array things like push() and pop()
[00:46:33] <coldhead> objects do weird inheritance voodoo that no one really understands
[00:46:44] <arielserafini> haha
[00:46:54] <rgr> lol. Hmm. I beter revisit a lot of code and check my brackets... :)
[00:47:14] <coldhead> rgr: you almost always want to use {}, it makes you look like a cool guy
[00:47:21] <rgr> (and bother to actually read a js manual)
[00:47:38] <rgr> yes those brackets are 1337er
[00:47:46] <coldhead> eh, a lot of people never bother with the manuals
[00:47:49] <coldhead> they don't have many jokes
[00:47:59] <coldhead> although Javascript: The Good Parts at least has a butterfly on the cover
[00:48:04] <coldhead> which is good if you like butterflies
[00:48:18] <rgr> I dont. I would have thought a tiger or something more exciting
[00:48:19] <coppa> *<8[  vs *<8}
[00:48:39] <arielserafini> bedtime, later folks
[00:48:47] <coldhead> the official Javascript reference has a rhino on the cover
[00:48:55] <coldhead> but the butterfly is meant to symbolise the good parts
[00:49:11] <coldhead> from the horrible caterpillar a beautiful light fluttering butterfly emerges
[00:49:20] <coldhead> it's powerful symbolism
[00:49:58] <coppa> what about the turtle then http://www.nicholascloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/maintainable-javascript.jpg
[00:51:51] <coldhead> i guess that symbolises going for slow, resilient javascript which is easy to work with
[00:52:01] <coldhead> rather than fast unreadable heavily optimised nonsense
[00:52:19] <coppa> :)
[00:53:19] <rgr> thanks, simple as that. all good now. another little milestone reached... ;)
[00:54:27] <rgr> and yeah coldhead, it was the array notation for objects that threw me. And much as I hate "morning excuses" I did just fall out of scratcher following a night of nightmares about recursive css definitions...
[00:54:41] <coldhead> uh oh
[00:54:51] <coldhead> its not your fault, anyway
[00:54:58] <coldhead> its a Weird Thing about JS
[01:00:22] <coppa> http://binarymind.org/bastien/funny-javascript.jpg
[01:04:16] <coldhead> cuttte
[01:04:46] <tw2113> coldhead, they used your portrait for the cover
[01:05:18] <coldhead> http://wurstcaptures.untergrund.net/duck.html
[01:05:30] <coldhead> i wish i were that vivid and yellow!
[01:05:36] <ruby_on_tails> hi coldhead
[01:06:20] <coldhead> hiya rubsy
[01:06:32] <ruby_on_tails> could you check this ? http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/textarea-expander/index.html, if you type new lines in the second textarea here, the textarea expands, but with a glitch, the scroller appears first(though its hidden), and then the code removes it. how can i remove that glitch ? as soon as the user goes on to a new line, the height of the textarea still remains old, so the first line moves up, then the js acts and expands the te
[01:07:54] <coldhead> i don't see the glitch
[01:08:02] <coldhead> and i'm not sure how you'd remove it
[01:08:08] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[01:08:10] <ruby_on_tails> ok
[01:08:12] <coldhead> other than some kind of css !important perhaps
[01:08:19] <coldhead> which browser are you testing with?
[01:08:23] <ruby_on_tails> chrome
[01:08:38] <coldhead> me too
[01:08:46] <coldhead> what a bitter mystery
[01:09:15] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[01:12:17] <john-dev> hi, i am using jquery ui to sort stuff (draggable) in view A. I want to be able to use the .ui-multidraggable class in view B (listview) using checkboxes but i can't set the class, any ideas?
[01:12:39] <john-dev> is it somehow possible to "trick" here?
[01:29:38] <expando-> hi, guys
[01:29:48] <expando-> i have a simple javascript question
[01:30:03] <expando-> for( var item, i = ‚àí1; item = array[++i] ) {
[01:30:03] <expando-> }
[01:30:16] <expando-> how this loop understand when to stop?
[01:31:03] <expando-> and why it stops when we have some of the array elements set to null, false, undefined ?
[01:31:29] <xec> you're missing the second, uh, "argument" to for, which is the condition
[01:32:15] <xec> but if you're using jquery, you can use $.each(array, function(i, item){ ... }); to loop arrays
[01:33:01] <expando-> i miss nothing
[01:33:21] <xec> expando-: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for
[01:33:22] <expando-> in the book i'm reading it is said - it is a javascript optimization technique
[01:33:37] <shoky> wha?
[01:33:40] <expando-> it is not "usual" for loop
[01:34:11] <expando-> i know the for loop syntax in java, vb, c#, javascript, action script and much more languages
[01:34:17] <expando-> it was strange for me
[01:34:26] <expando-> it is the reason to show this loop here
[01:34:33] <xec> either your book is mistaken, or you are indeed missing something
[01:34:39] <shoky> what are you talking about ;S
[01:34:51] <expando-> no it is not a mistake
[01:34:59] <expando-> it is a kind of strange for loop
[01:35:06] <shoky> what book are you reading?
[01:35:19] <expando-> oreilly jquery cookbook
[01:35:50] <xec> !
[01:36:26] <expando-> no it is explicitly said
[01:36:43] <expando-> it is an optimization for loops that works
[01:37:17] <shoky> what page?
[01:37:20] <expando-> if none of the elements of the array is undefined, null, false, 0, or "".
[01:37:21] <shoky> or chapter
[01:37:23] <xec> you sure you're not missing a semicolon in there somewhere?
[01:37:37] <expando-> 5.12 coding bare metal loops
[01:37:49] <expando-> is the section i'm reading at the moment
[01:38:01] <expando-> and it is mentioned
[01:38:15] <expando-> i asked some of the friends of mine and no answer yet
[01:38:33] <shoky> well he copied it right
[01:39:04] <expando-> i think the book is written by some guys that knows javascript engines internal implementation
[01:39:09] <shoky> and yeah i see how it works
[01:39:25] <expando-> but if you don't know this in advance
[01:39:31] <expando-> and you see in some project
[01:39:32] <shoky> it "knows" how to stop when the second clause is false-y
[01:39:41] <shoky> it's a regular for loop with the 3rd clause missing
[01:39:45] <ntshan> I like the book "Javascript: The Good Parts"
[01:39:47] <shoky> and as they say
[01:39:57] <shoky> But there is a catch: this loop works only if your array has no ìfalseî elements, that is,
[01:39:57] <shoky> elements whose value is undefined, null, false, 0, or ""
[01:40:02] <expando-> it will be a little confusing
[01:40:17] <expando-> for beginers and no javascript professionals
[01:40:19] <shoky> expando-: it's a regular for loop
[01:40:22] <xec> yes, but you still need three parts in the for syntax (unless youre using for-in)
[01:40:30] <shoky> you can omit the last one
[01:40:43] <expando-> the third part is not needed because of ++i
[01:40:47] <greek> Heya fellas. Is it (dangerously) resource intensive to have lots of draggables and sortables on a page? Around about 15 to be exact. Each one has around 10 elements.
[01:40:47] <xec> for (var item, i = -1; item = array[++i];) should work
[01:40:50] <shoky> (or the middle one.. or all of them)
[01:41:53] <xec> expando-: the one in the book doesn't work, you can leave the last part empty but not omit the semicolon as far as i know
[01:42:45] <shoky> o ya you need the semicolon
[01:42:50] <shoky> stupid book
[01:43:25] <expando-> i got it running
[01:43:29] <xec> anyway, the reason it works is because assignments return whatever was assigned
[01:43:36] <expando-> and a very pleasant girl
[01:43:39] <expando-> described it
[01:43:42] <expando-> in javascript
[01:43:53] <expando-> you don't have array out of bounds exception
[01:44:07] <expando-> and when it reaches the element after the last one
[01:44:24] <expando-> variable - item
[01:44:27] <expando-> becomes
[01:44:33] <ntshan> it's a good book...one of the biggest mistakes of most js implementations is the auto-semicolon
[01:44:34] <expando-> false and the middle for part
[01:44:50] <expando-> and it don't have the last part explicitely
[01:44:55] <expando-> because of
[01:44:58] <expando-> +ii
[01:45:01] <expando-> ++i
[01:45:06] <ntshan> and type coercion...aka "truthiness"
[01:45:08] <xec> yes, we get it :)
[01:45:15] <expando-> i think i'm understanding now it
[01:45:24] <expando-> thank you. i'm not a javascript expert
[01:45:34] <expando-> in the past i was very good in java syntax
[01:45:43] <expando-> as well as in c++
[01:45:44] <expando-> :)
[01:45:49] <expando-> thank you for the time spent
[01:47:09] <xec> putting var inside the for loop is bad practice too, because it will not be scoped to the for loop as you might assume
[01:47:46] <john-dev> hey, i am using jquery ui and somehow this extension denys me to add the ui-multidraggable class to a checkbox using addClass, any idea how i can still add this class?
[01:48:12] <shoky> that whole "recipe" is about "are you worried that you're using $.each a lot and it's creating unneeded functions?? use this awesome for loop"
[01:48:44] <xec> 100 bucks says your $.each() loop is not your bottleneck ;)
[01:48:47] <shoky> and they don't warn once of what would happen if you had inner closures referencing your shit
[01:49:08] <shoky> with modern js engines i doubt there's real overhead
[01:49:31] <shoky> a bit of memory, maybe
[01:50:04] <shoky> which is usually worth it, when functions are your scopes anyway
[01:52:27] <kitofr> Q: is there a way to prevent jQuery to write to the console when recieving f.e. 404 on an $.ajax call?
[01:52:58] <xec> jQuery doesn't write to console on its own.
[01:53:12] <xec> firebug shows http requests in console if that's what you're using
[01:53:48] <kitofr> chrome dev tools, but yes; same stuff i suppose
[01:53:56] <kitofr> ok, so it's the browser that logs it?
[01:54:00] <shoky> kitofr: right click the console
[01:54:10] <shoky> first option..
[01:54:13] <shoky> uncheck dat
[01:54:40] <kitofr> it was unchecked
[01:54:54] <shoky> ah right yer talking about an error
[01:55:00] <kitofr> ok; well can't do that much about it then i suppose
[01:55:00] <kitofr> :)
[01:55:09] <kitofr> didn't want to our users to "know"
[01:55:13] <kitofr> but ok
[01:56:08] <VectorX> in chorme is there a way to see waht js is run when you click a object ?. trying to debug some wordpress code
[01:56:15] <shoky> a user could have his browser play trumpet fanfare on a 404 if he likes
[01:56:26] <xec> i know i do!
[01:57:14] <xec> VectorX: define "object"
[01:57:51] <kitofr> more trumpets!
[02:00:48] <lovegame> hello all, can i ask question here if i need support ?
[02:02:07] <lovegame> i added html input throw jquery but i cant add event blur to that input, any idea ?
[02:02:47] <xec> lovegame: bind events after the element is in the dom, or use delegation
[02:03:12] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[02:03:32] <xec> btw, by "throw" i assume you mean "through"
[02:04:04] <lovegame> can any one give me the website which we can post code to share plz
[02:05:23] <shoky> ?p
[02:05:24] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:05:25] <lovegame> xec: can u give me any website to post code to show u!
[02:05:38] <xec> ?demo @ lovegame
[02:05:39] <bot-t> lovegame, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:05:55] <lovegame> xec sec plz
[02:06:11] <xec> shoky: he wanted it from me! your links are not good enough for us!
[02:06:30] * xec sticks his nose in the air
[02:07:01] <shoky> i'll work on my links, your linkness
[02:07:19] <xec> that's SIR linkness, to you
[02:07:33] <xec> ur uh, mister linkness?
[02:07:55] <shoky> i'm stumped
[02:08:03] <lovegame> xec: if u have time to look plz http://fixee.org/paste/p6hb9ls/
[02:08:09] <xec> lol
[02:08:25] <xec> he used yours! xec--
[02:08:31] <shoky> lul
[02:08:41] <sh0ne> how can I rewrite this little JS snippet (3 lines) into JQuery http://jsfiddle.net/7nan3/1/
[02:10:19] <shoky> sh0ne: you did it right..
[02:10:23] <lovegame> sh0ne try read http://api.jquery.com/bind/ 1st
[02:11:50] <lovegame> any one can help me with this  http://fixee.org/paste/p6hb9ls/  << blure not working
[02:13:13] <xec> lovegame: it should work. BUT you seem to have attached the input inside the element with the click handler, which will replace the input again
[02:13:39] <xec> lovegame: copypasted your code to jsfiddle, commented out some bits and added .unbind() http://jsfiddle.net/Q3NAW/
[02:14:26] <xec> lovegame: i added the .unbind() so the click handler only will run once (and therefore not prevent you from clicking the input field)
[02:14:29] <lovegame> xec i add event at TD on click, need make textfield to update value
[02:15:08] <lovegame> xec: when user complete edit, when click any where else, i need remove the textfield
[02:16:05] <VectorX> xec object as in say a a tag or div tag
[02:16:16] <xec> lovegame: surely there are loads of plugins that do this sort of stuff
[02:16:47] <lovegame> xec: .unbind()  not solve the problem
[02:16:56] <xec> VectorX: does it affect anything in the DOM? you might be able to make chrome break at dom change
[02:17:23] <xec> lovegame: yes, i'm just highlighting the issue
[02:17:54] <xec> VectorX: is the click event bound by jquery?
[02:17:59] <VectorX> xec i cant see it doing anything, it opens a popup
[02:18:10] <VectorX> xec i think it is
[02:18:37] <xec> VectorX: if so, check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2008592/can-i-find-events-bound-on-an-element-with-jquery
[02:18:51] <lovegame> xec: the problem is Jquery not see the test1 as dom coz its created at runtime
[02:19:17] <xec> lovegame: not true, as my demo shows - the console.log works on blue
[02:19:19] <xec> blur*
[02:19:47] <lovegame> not working for me
[02:20:25] <xec> lovegame: you click the text "click" and get an input right?
[02:20:35] <lovegame> yes
[02:20:54] <xec> and then click in the input and then outside it
[02:21:08] <xec> you get "OOoo" in the console
[02:21:19] <lovegame> no
[02:21:22] <lovegame> i did that
[02:22:08] <lovegame> no, nothing at console, i click and see INPUT, click again, edit, press tab , nothing at console
[02:22:22] <xec> maybe firebug lite was a bad idea. http://jsfiddle.net/Q3NAW/1/
[02:22:33] <xec> lovegame ^ try that - you get an alert?
[02:23:18] <lovegame> xec: sec plz, thanx for ur help
[02:25:46] <lovegame> xec: working thanx, but how i can add "Click" again ?
[02:26:43] <lovegame> $(last_edit).bind("click"); ??
[02:27:11] <sh0ne> shoky lovegame: thank you for your help.
[02:27:24] <xec> my suggestion? don't unbind click, but prevent propagation of clicks on the input
[02:28:28] <lovegame> xec thanx working now :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
[02:28:42] <lovegame> xec smoking time xD
[02:31:23] <keirlav87> if i have a string which contains a postcode, is there a way to match the postcode in the string and remove it?
[02:42:51] <hooloovoo> keirlav87: ummm... possibly using regex, but it's not 100%
[02:46:56] <FND> when binding events to an object (`$({}).bind(...)`), how can I inspect the list of callbacks? .data("events") only seems to work for DOM nodes
[02:47:51] <keirlav87> i'm trying to use this regex - http://networking.mydesigntool.com/viewtopic.php?tid=299&id=31 - to match uk postcode, but it only matches on a string that is a postcode, not on a string that contains a postcode, unfortunately i don't know anything about regex really but would someone mind helping me amend that regex so it will ignore chars before or after that pattern, but sitll match the pattern if thats possible?
[02:49:49] <hooloovoo> FND: woah tricky. the object get's a jquery property which contains it
[02:49:58] <hooloovoo> but i don't think the name of the jquery object is the same every time
[02:51:12] <FND> hooloovoo: I don't follow (I've tried to trace the source, but got lost after too many layers of indirection)
[02:53:11] <hooloovoo> FND: try to bind it to a object then console.log the object
[02:53:24] <hooloovoo> and you'll see a jquery property. in that you got the event
[02:55:21] <FND> oh
[02:57:16] <FND> hooloovoo: the property name is jQuery.expando
[02:57:22] <FND> so that works, thanks
[02:57:33] <gataraid> can I use $("#shippingSameBilling").trigger('change'); to trigger this http://pastebin.com/3BKHvzZn
[02:57:40] <Deviad> Hi guys, I'm trying to implement the jquery bbq plugin to enable the back button. Unfortunately I'm uncapable of making it work with my current tabbed panel code.
[02:58:25] <hmm> $('#element').on('dragover', 'li', function(){}); <- If I have nested li elements, it always select the top most one. Is there a way to make it not do that?
[02:58:30] <hooloovoo> gataraid: ofc
[02:58:39] <gataraid> what does ofc mean?
[02:58:40] <gataraid> Sorry
[02:58:51] <hmm> granden: Of course.
[02:58:53] <hooloovoo> gataraid: of course. trigger triggers any event
[02:58:54] <gataraid> of course?
[02:58:55] <gataraid> Okay
[02:58:58] <hmm> gataraid: *
[02:59:18] <gataraid> I should place that after the function though, right?
[02:59:25] <gataraid> (the trigger)
[02:59:28] <hooloovoo> gataraid: yes
[02:59:52] <gataraid> thank you very much
[03:00:15] <gataraid> it doesn't seem to work :s
[03:00:38] <hooloovoo> hmm: ummm, well... which one do you want it to select then?
[03:01:00] <gataraid> if(jQuery(this).is(":checked"))
[03:02:00] <hooloovoo> gataraid: it should work. make a fiddle and i'll go get some lunch. i'll look at it when i get back =)
[03:12:20] <hmm> hooloovoo: I want it to select the most nested li element.
[03:12:47] <hmm> Say, I dragover an ul with 10 li's in, I want it to select the closest li element to the cursor.
[03:13:03] <hmm> And if the li's got nested li's, same there.
[03:13:48] <hmm> hooloovoo: kinda like droppables work, with the 'greedy' option enabled
[03:18:27] <erethnor> hiya, I found a bug in the latest jquery ui commit on github
[03:18:35] <Liaz> Hi everyone, I am new on this channel. I would like to know, is there somewhere a list of the irc chan by country or language for jquery. Or everybody just gather here ?
[03:18:59] <erethnor> I'm trying to report it but I cannot register on jquery TRAC as there's an error (http://bugs.jqueryui.com/register)
[03:19:55] <xec> erethnor: try #jqueryui-dev
[03:20:09] <erethnor> ty xec
[03:20:46] <xec> Liaz: you can "/msg alis help" for instructions on channel search. that said i think most people gather here (i'm from norway)
[03:21:33] <sh0ne> Does the jqXHR object has 'update' feature ( like to be used insted of xhr.update.addEventListener("progress", ...) ) ?
[03:21:48] <Liaz> thank you xec :) I will stay here then :)
[03:22:00] <Liaz> I am from france (currently in Berlin though ;) )
[03:22:03] <Trudko> Guys what if I want to find all divs with class "myClass" and all p with class someOtherClass ?
[03:22:25] <xec> Liaz: there is a #jquery-fr but there's like 2 people there
[03:23:09] <Liaz> xec: :D so I definitely stay here ;)
[03:23:24] <xec> Trudko: $('div.myClass, p.someOtherClass') ?
[03:23:25] <Liaz> Trudko: what do you want to do ?
[03:23:51] <Liaz> .each(function(){ what ever youlike });
[03:24:26] <Liaz> Trudko: just + the lines from xec and me ;)
[03:24:31] <Trudko> xec: ou thats it I forgot to put  ,
[03:24:42] <Trudko> Liaz: thx I was just courious about selector
[03:25:02] <Liaz> Trudko: k :)
[03:25:43] <Trudko> today I am going to apply for job and they want to test people using Jquery :/
[03:25:55] <Trudko> I worked with it but who knew what they will give me
[03:26:38] <Liaz> Trudko: animations maybe ?
[03:26:44] <Liaz> addClass, attr
[03:27:01] <xec> Trudko: sounds interesting. hope you're allowed to refer to documentation?
[03:27:27] <Liaz> Trudko: good luck for your interview anyway
[03:27:47] <znow> hey, im using jcarousellite for a image slider, where I show 4 images at a time. when I hover on one of them, I have information appearing beneath the image, but the images next to this image is getting pushed down, how can I solve this? https://gist.github.com/ http://imgur.com/JJn6Q
[03:27:55] <Trudko> Liaz: I actually worry about animations because I did not work with that :/
[03:28:08] <Trudko> xec: not sure,.
[03:28:09] <Trudko> and thx
[03:28:13] <Trudko> btw is it true what I read: When context is a DOMElement jQuery transforms $(selector, context) into $(context).find(selector). You can avoid much of the logic the constructor does including some string parsing by making this change yourself.
[03:28:43] <xec> znow: your link to gist.github is to the main (blank) page
[03:28:55] <znow> xec: sorry
[03:28:56] <znow> sec
[03:28:59] <Liaz> Trudko: don't worry, just practice
[03:29:04] <Liaz> very easy
[03:29:09] <znow> xec: https://gist.github.com/920689455ad4ec0c26fe
[03:29:15] <Liaz> follow the syntax, hop, it works
[03:29:29] <xec> hope*
[03:29:35] <Liaz> try 2 or 3 simple examples, you will feel more secure then Trudko
[03:29:47] <xec> yes, prayer is essential when coding javascript :)
[03:29:49] <Trudko> Liaz: yeah I worked with jquery selectors, some hiding showing stuff mostly and I do understand javascript so hopefully I will be ok
[03:30:12] <Liaz> Trudko: just take an empty file and try it
[03:30:27] <Trudko> Liaz: yeap doing some stuff in jsfiddle
[03:30:29] <Liaz> like animate on a css height change
[03:30:47] <Liaz> or on an opacity change
[03:30:57] <Liaz> it makes nice effects :)
[03:31:06] <xec> znow: any chance you can make it a live demo? like jsfiddle.com -- hard to tell what's going on from that paste
[03:31:09] <slick-> hey can someone please help me out‚Ä¶ when i have a click event, i make a #station div appear and place it inside a container, using this code:
[03:31:10] <slick-> jQuery(document).on("mousemove", function(e) {jQuery(".station").css({"left": (parseInt(self.mouseX(e), 10) + offX) - self.offsetLeft + "px","top": (parseInt(self.mouseY(e), 10) + offY) - self.offsetTop + "px"});});
[03:31:17] <znow> xec: ofc, give me a sec
[03:31:21] <slick-> but when i keep the mouse down, the position of the element changes :(
[03:31:28] <Liaz> slick-: pastbin better ?
[03:31:32] <slick-> sry k
[03:31:34] <xec> znow: you can link images from lorempixel.com
[03:31:45] <znow> thanks
[03:31:49] <slick-> http://jsfiddle.net/dh6WE/
[03:32:05] <xec> znow: also, the generated html instead of haml please
[03:32:12] <Trudko> Also I heard that jquery selectors works from right to left what does it mean ? because http://jsfiddle.net/CktDC/ first is P and then DIV
[03:32:13] <znow> xec: yes ofc :)
[03:34:32] <znow> xec: the thing is, im running rails, so i need to reproduce some id fetching etc.... would you rather see a live demo of this instead of me buggering with jsfiddle?
[03:34:45] <Liaz> slick-: did you try to put your computations in variables
[03:34:56] <xec> znow: sure
[03:34:59] <Liaz> like var leftvalue = (parseInt(self.mouseX(e), 10) + offX) - self.offsetLeft:
[03:35:14] <Liaz> same for the other
[03:35:18] <slick-> the item places fine if i just click...
[03:35:19] <slick-> bu
[03:35:24] <slick-> but when i hold the mouse the item jumps
[03:35:28] <slick-> away from the mouse..
[03:35:38] <xec> znow: although, it's often the "buggering with jsfiddle" part that leads you to realize the error
[03:35:42] <slick-> i mean if i hold it down and move
[03:35:58] <znow> xec: true, but this should all though be a css problem (I hope)
[03:36:05] <Liaz> did you try bind ?
[03:36:29] <slick-> nop
[03:37:11] <Liaz> slick-: or try http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/ ?
[03:38:07] <xec> slick-: could you make a demo that actually demonstrates the issue? see ?testcase
[03:38:07] <bot-t> slick-, http://xkr.us/js/testcase
[03:38:56] <slick-> hmm
[03:39:02] <slick-> i should try mouse move
[03:41:13] <Trudko> btw is it true what I read: When context is a DOMElement jQuery transforms $(selector, context) into $(context).find(selector). You can avoid much of the logic the constructor does including some string parsing by making this change yourself.
[03:45:27] <greek> Heya. Easiest way to get the ID of the currently selected tab?
[03:49:16] <znow> xec: http://ac.znow.dk/da/organisation the text doesnt seem to appear here, but the images are jumping down, im trying to figure out why the text arent showing
[03:50:46] <xec> znow: there are divs in your ul
[03:51:04] <znow> xec: yeah for the employee information
[03:51:16] <xec> only valid element in a ul is li
[03:51:58] <xec> dunno if that's what causing it, but should be fixed anyway ;)
[03:52:35] <xec> actually, i think it is what's causing the jumping
[03:54:34] <greek> The best thing I can think of is to use $("div#tabs li.ui-state-active a").attr("href");   (which returns "#tab1") and the trim the # at the beginning.
[03:56:06] <pangelovski> hi guys, does anyone know the class i need to change in order to get a different background for the content?
[03:56:53] <john-dev> depends how the class is calles :-/
[03:56:58] <john-dev> maybe .conten?
[03:57:01] <john-dev> content*
[03:59:07] <smbdiwevuwgvi> var R = jQuery.extend(true, {}, emptyelement);
[03:59:18] <smbdiwevuwgvi> will *COPY* object emptyelement?
[03:59:50] <znow> xec: is that an issue?
[04:00:57] <blackspotwiggins> smbdiwevuwgvi, did you even look at the syntax for extend?
[04:01:00] <blackspotwiggins> or did you just guess?
[04:01:29] <slick-> im trying to do a draggable event on mouse down, but when i dont have htis code: "top": e.offsetY + "px","left": e.offsetX + "px"
[04:01:38] <slick-> the item is displayed in an improper place
[04:01:41] <slick-> anyone know why?
[04:01:48] <slick-> also if i click down and move the mouse it doesnt work
[04:01:52] <slick-> and jumps
[04:02:04] <smbdiwevuwgvi> blackspotwiggins: I was told that it does, I got it in code and it seems to not work
[04:02:22] <jita> How can i hide number of elements ?

[04:34:58] <jackp10> hi to everyone
[04:36:42] <jackp10> I hope someone can help me. I am trying to use the slideToggle on a menu that contains a tree. The problem I have is that when i click a link inside that menu, the section close and reopen once the page is fully loaded, and I dont understand why
[04:37:13] <jackp10> I am only using this:  $( ".section, .tree" ).click( function() { $( this ).find( ".content" ).toggle(); }
[04:38:04] <jackp10> it is almost as the click event within the section tells the toggle to close the section, refresh the page and reopen it
[04:38:28] <Biomech> hello!
[04:39:04] <Biomech> can anyone tell me how/if it's possible to add "unknown" to the date Picker? I'm using it in a form where I ask people for event dates and sometimes they have no date planned
[04:39:12] <Trudko> is it true what I read: When context is a DOMElement jQuery transforms $(selector, context) into $(context).find(selector). You can avoid much of the logic the constructor does including some string parsing by making this change yourself.
[04:40:12] <xec> jackp10: that click handler will run for any (and all) clicks on those elements or their descendants
[04:40:26] <xec> jackp10: meaning that a click on a link inside is going to trigger the toggle
[04:41:47] <Ravindran> jackp10: is ".section" & ".tree" elements are one inside another? If so, the event might be triggered twice
[04:42:49] <jackp10> no.. .section and .tree are 2 separate divs. Each contains a div.header and div.content
[04:43:39] <jackp10> perhaps i should trigger the click only on the div.header then. this should prevent the toggle to close on the div.content ( i think)
[04:45:01] <xec> jackp10: yes, that should work, or you can prevent propagation of clicks on the links (or some child node containing them)
[04:45:43] <jackp10> xec, Ravindran: ok it worked. I have set the click on div.header and used $( this ).parent().find( ".content" ).toggle(); and it worked
[04:46:36] <jackp10> is it the correct way using the formed i used to get to the .content, or is there a better way ?
[04:46:44] <jackp10> *form
[04:46:59] <jackp10> i mean: $( this ).parent().find( ".content" ).toggle()
[04:47:23] <jackp10> it does the job, but I wonder if there is a better way‚Ä¶ i am still in the learning process !! :P
[04:48:14] <SparK_BR> $(this).next(".content").toggle();
[04:49:01] <Ravindran> jackp10: it's correct. it content is sibling to header, you can use siblings method
[04:49:08] <SparK_BR> next reads the dom as a list and not as a tree
[04:49:53] <xec> .next() will only match the next sibling (and a filter will just make sure the collection is 0 length if it doesn't match the next sibling)
[04:50:32] <Biomech> anyone? adding "to be confirmed" to date picker?
[04:50:45] <jackp10> oh‚Ä¶ ok ‚Ä¶ i thought I had to go up one level and then down to get to it‚Ä¶ that is good to know‚Ä¶ thanks xec
[04:51:09] <xec> jackp10: i can't tell you what would work without seeing the markup though
[04:51:52] <jackp10> sure‚Ä¶ but it does work with the use of next.. i just tested it. :)
[04:52:22] <Biomech> no noe?
[04:54:04] <Biomech> i guess not
[04:55:51] <Trudko> what is this selector for? $("div#intro .head").

[05:20:27] <yuka> can somebody recommend a good plugin to search inside select boxes, i got a select box with around 1900 options inside, some of the options are long strings featuring many words. ideally i would want it to search for any word in a given string
[05:28:03] <hooloovoo> yuka: wow...
[05:28:32] <krismeld> hi, does anyone know how to target dynamically created option elements inside a <select> list? I give them a class but i cant reach them, only the option elements that are there on pageload...
[05:28:54] <hooloovoo> krismeld: sounds like you're binding some event to them on pageload
[05:30:08] <xec> yuka: have you seen http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ ?
[05:30:31] <xec> yuka: haven't tried it personally, but looks promising
[05:30:57] <yuka> yeh i will try it and see if its good enough thanks,
[05:31:07] <yuka> i am also happy if somebody knows a few more alternatives
[05:31:15] <krismeld> yeah, i think you are right, i've put the $('.class_im_trying_to reach').click(function() {}); inside a $(document).ready(function() {});
[05:32:58] <krismeld> any ideas on how to work around it?
[05:33:55] <sahbeewah> ?on
[05:33:55] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:33:55] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised ‚Äúon()‚Äù.
[05:33:57] <bot-t> b-ot, Couldn't find "memorised ‚Äúon()‚Äù." in jQuery Docs.
[05:34:06] <xec> BOT WARS!
[05:36:02] <krismeld> ok, so i should get rid of the $(document).ready(function() {}); and change my click to on("click", function() etc etc ?
[05:37:54] <sahbeewah> no
[05:38:04] <sahbeewah> read it first
[05:39:21] <xec> krismeld: the answer to "how do i target elements that don't exist yet" is "you can't".
[05:40:17] <xec> krismeld: if you are trying to bind events however, you can use delegates, see http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[05:41:18] <krismeld> ok thank you very much!
[05:48:56] <Ravindran> krismeld: you need to wrap all jquery code inside doc.ready.
[05:50:44] <softmanpetro> how should I check if a json element in a response is an object?
[05:51:11] <coppa> arf : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[05:52:09] <softmanpetro> nvm typeof
[05:57:16] <krismeld> ok after looking through the .on() docs im still a little lost. How do i delegate an event to my dynamically created elements (they all have the same class, but they -and the class- doesnt exist on page load
[05:57:48] <SparK_BR> .live?
[06:00:27] <thecodecowboy> if one page sets event.preventDefault() for a keycode event (the equivalent of a a back button), how long isDefaultPrevented?
[06:00:49] <_dc> krismeld: call it on the element that you would delegate from ie $parent.on('click', $dynamicElement, callback)
[06:01:02] <thecodecowboy> its for a smart TV which has a special implementation for back buttons ^^
[06:01:14] <krismeld> arh ok thank you _dc
[06:01:24] <_dc> np
[06:01:34] <krismeld> could $parent be $(window) ?
[06:02:05] <jomofcw> Hello !
[06:02:11] <_dc> sure but that's not advisable as it will bubble from the window...try to call it from the closest element that is not rendered dynamically
[06:02:42] <krismeld> ok, that makes sense :)
[06:02:44] <jomofcw> I would like to modify ajax data with dataFilter, then to return the string modified but from the created jQuery element $(data). How can I do it ?
[06:02:46] <jomofcw> please.
[06:04:02] <defaultro_> hi folks, how can I implement this using jquery and that it will work with other browsers? http://pastebin.com/xrszVB3j
[06:05:07] <SteveC> Using jquery forms to convert a form to ajax - is it possible to reset it back to being a regular form afterwards?
[06:12:30] <jomofcw> SteveC just unbind the submit event ?
[06:13:28] <defaultro_> hi folks, how can I implement this using jquery and that it will work with other browsers? http://pastebin.com/xrszVB3j
[06:14:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does normal Jquery work when viewing a website on a smartphone?
[06:15:51] <callumacrae> ecky--ptang-zoob: yes
[06:16:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so what's jquery mobile for then?
[06:16:39] <callumacrae> jQuery Mobile is like Sencha Touch and a few other libraries; they just provide an easy to use template for you to use on your website
[06:16:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ah
[06:17:35] <callumacrae> iWebKit
[06:17:36] <callumacrae> I remember that
[06:17:38] <callumacrae> lol
[06:17:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> With Jquery tabs: I'd like to add a small colored circle in the top left of the tab, is that possible?
[06:18:29] <callumacrae> Yes, but use CSS
[06:19:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how would I do that?
[06:19:35] <callumacrae> Is jQuery tabs a plugin?
[06:19:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> part of jquery UI
[06:22:12] <rgr> in a jq ajax call when I set dataType: "json" do I still need to specifically set the parameters to json using stringify or should it be implicit?
[06:23:10] <Zogot> rgr: Thats the datatype of the response
[06:25:46] <jomofcw> Why this doesn't work please : http://pastebin.com/EfPh8uX8
[06:25:58] <SparK_BR> because it has an error
[06:26:04] <defaultro_> LOL
[06:26:06] <SparK_BR> =D
[06:26:35] <SparK_BR> you're welcome
[06:27:13] <jomofcw> :p SparK_BR
[06:27:15] <callumacrae> jomofcw: Because you're being too generous with the new lines
[06:27:35] <jomofcw> callumacrae yea  xD I do it to make it more readable for you :/ perhaps I'm wrong.
[06:27:43] <jomofcw> in fact, it return nothing.
[06:27:57] <jomofcw> I want to be able to modify the DOM structure of the data, then to send it
[06:28:06] <SparK_BR> jomofcw, how can we debug pseudo-code?
[06:28:10] <SparK_BR> post the real thing
[06:28:36] <jomofcw> you sure :x ? OK ^^
[06:28:47] <SparK_BR> usually you put data in a var
[06:28:50] <SparK_BR> then you modify
[06:28:57] <SparK_BR> and only then you call the ajax
[06:29:24] <jomofcw> http://pastebin.com/4vib9zgP
[06:29:36] <jomofcw> and so the problem, is that in the colorbox, it display nothing.
[06:30:12] <callumacrae> Your code is unbelievably unreadable
[06:30:13] <ddssc> is there a way to manually trigger firefox password save from jquery?
[06:30:16] <callumacrae> You need to use less whitesapce xD
[06:36:06] <jomofcw> callumacrae yea I'm wrong on it :/ i know... I still find it more readable, but that's just my opinion xD.
[06:36:20] <jomofcw> callumacrae anyway, could you see a better solution for datafilter there please ?
[06:36:30] <shoky> jomofcw: doing $(data).html()  would take the first root element (after some have been stripped like <head> <body>) and give you its _inner_ html
[06:37:30] <jomofcw> Hm yea right shoky.
[06:37:36] <shoky> (maybe thats what you want, i'm just saying)
[06:37:43] <jomofcw> so how could I "convert" the full jQuery element to string ?
[06:38:05] <jomofcw> nop shoky I want to get the full HTML string of the jQuery element.
[06:38:25] <shoky> is it an html snippet or a full html doc or what
[06:38:41] <jomofcw> A full HTML doc shoky.
[06:38:59] <shoky> ;S that's not nice to work with
[06:39:09] <shoky> console.log( $(data) ) and see..
[06:40:24] <shoky> so you wouldn't get back a full html doc anyway, you can't parse those with $(..)
[06:41:25] <jomofcw> Hm, so, have you got any tip to do it better please :s ?
[06:42:08] <shoky> ideally your server would only generate the snippet you need.. not a full doc
[06:42:25] <shoky> i donno how best to deal with full html
[06:42:54] <jomofcw> Currently I can't change the server response :/
[06:42:59] <jomofcw> I should do it later.
[06:43:11] <Logikos> hi, i'm looking at the nivoslider jquery plugin useage page, and i just had a javascript question ... it uses $('#id').nivoSlider( { effect:'random,... } ) .. i get that { } is defining an object to be passed to the nivoslider function but how is it that effect:'random' doesnt have quotes, does it not have to be 'effect':'random'
[06:43:20] <Logikos> or is it because its an object property that it doesnt require quotes ?
[06:43:23] <shadykhan> whats the best way to pull an rrs feed with images?
[06:43:25] <Logikos> or is the docs wrong
[06:43:35] <shoky> then I dunno, guess you'd need some manual parsing
[06:44:00] <Logikos> oh sorry, this is the link of where i see this: http://nivo.dev7studios.com/support/jquery-plugin-usage/
[06:44:21] <jomofcw> shoky yup, that's what I'm trying to do with dataFilter :/.
[06:44:41] <shoky> Logikos: you don't need quotes when defining properties of objects (only if it has special chars)
[06:45:01] <shoky> Logikos: var myobj = { someProp: 5, "anotherProp": 6 }   perfectly fine
[06:45:21] <Logikos> shoky: ty
[06:45:53] <SparK_BR> "weird-name" vs normalName
[06:46:36] <Logikos> also, i intend to get some of the values for those properties from a data-attrib, some of the property values are numeric rather than a string but useing data-attrib="5" for example, if i pass its value will it pass as a string and will that matter? or is javascript like php in that if you try to use a string as a number it just converts it for you then uses it
[06:49:30] <greek> Heya fellas. I've got a select menu in $(this) and I can get it's selected option's value using $(this).val() however I'd now like to get the text inside the selected value's option tag.
[06:49:32] <erethnor> Logikos: jquery will convert that to a number. Also, javascript is not like PHP: 5 + '5' becomes '55', rather than 10
[06:49:35] <greek> From $(this) if possible
[06:51:05] <buzzedword> hey guys. i'm dealing with an interesting issue. how does everyone feel about minifying jquery yourself (re: your own build process) vs using the repo's build step or the packaged minifier? is that a no-no, or is it fair game?
[06:51:17] <blackspotwiggins> buzzedword, should work fine
[06:53:53] <buzzedword> huh. i've always been of the mindset that you should never minify a library that you don't own, and use the packaged min or build system
[06:55:17] <bastetmilo> Hi. How to make something stay if the action was hover? I have one element slideDown after hover and I don't want to change back after unhover - how can I do that?
[06:55:41] <timing> use events like mouseenter
[06:55:51] <timing> and set a class yourself
[06:56:06] <muzone> http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/Haper-rumpene-far-folk-til-a-tenke-2764033.html
[06:56:13] <SparK_BR> is that css or jq's slideDown?
[07:04:20] <shoky> greek: $(this).find('option:selected').text()
[07:05:39] <jomofcw> shoky I find a solution, probably not the better one, but it fix it : I do a $data = $('<div/>').append(data); now.
[07:06:08] <shoky> jomofcw: if that works for you, cool
[07:11:16] * SparK_BR wrote a parser! =D
[07:12:06] <anli_> Can I get the text of a textbox in a keydown event after the event has been applied to the textbox?
[07:13:18] <softmanpetro> how to get first td element of a object HTMLTableRowElement] ?
[07:14:19] <SparK_BR> .find("td:first") ?
[07:14:52] <SparK_BR> but first $(your object here)
[07:15:00] <softmanpetro> ah
[07:15:00] <SparK_BR> so you can use jquery
[07:15:35] <softmanpetro> thank you
[07:15:38] <softmanpetro> ;)
[07:15:42] <softmanpetro> I was confused
[07:16:03] <SparK_BR> you're welcome
[07:19:19] <Pitel_IPEX> softmanpetro: if you already has the dom object in some variable, you can do $("td:first", yourvar).something()
[07:20:18] <softmanpetro> I try to select with $('#prod_'+id).checked(true);
[07:20:35] <softmanpetro> but it said is not a function

[07:31:02] <Granjow> Good afternoon. I have this code: http://codepad.org/ijKC7VqB  Problem is, the success function receives an object and not text, despite of dataType: 'text'.
[07:31:08] <Granjow> Why can this happen?
[07:31:57] <Granjow> ah
[07:32:37] <Granjow> (targetVar) should be one line below.
[07:35:07] <Gisterogue> Hi guys - please can someone explain why this happens: I have a <section id="something" class="hello"> <p> blah </p> <div> something here <ul><li><button id="FirstThing" class="theButton"></li></ul></div></section>, and jquery code like this: console.log($('button.theButton').closest('.hello').attr('id');
[07:35:28] <Gisterogue> But it always prints "FirstThing" when it runs the console log. Any ideas why?
[07:38:49] <gnarf> Granjow: that code really doesn't make any sense -- why are you returning a function (that you execute on line 23) on line 6?
[07:39:28] <gnarf> why not just inline the body of that function? It seems kinda wasted
[07:39:59] <Robipo> Hello, how to get from <a/><b/> <a/><b/>  to <c><a/><b/></c> <c><a/><b/></c> ? I tried $('a + b').wrap('<c/>') but it only wraps b, not a+b
[07:40:43] <b-ot> No output.
[07:40:48] <gnarf> Robipo: $("a+b") selects b elements that are immediately after "a" elements
[07:41:04] <Robipo> Yeah, is there a way to select both elements at the same time ?
[07:41:06] <gnarf> $("a+b").prev().andSelf() might help
[07:41:37] <gnarf> ?andSelf
[07:41:37] <bot-t> .andSelf(): Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set. http://api.jquery.com/andSelf/
[07:41:40] <gnarf> ?prev

[07:43:32] <drvanon> Hello people, I read this: <script type = "text/javascript">
[07:43:35] <drvanon>     (function($){ ... })(jQuery);
[07:43:37] <drvanon> </script>
[07:43:39] <drvanon> What is going on here? In a real-world scenario, the three dots would be replaced with actual code that we would like to be executed. Here we see a definition of an anonymous function (also known as function closure), that takes a parameter called dollar sign ($). The function is wrapped in parenthesis, but why? You see, the function in this example is an anonymous function that has no reference to itself, but by wrapping it in parenthesis, the
[07:43:41] <drvanon>  JavaScript syntax allows us to reference to an anonymous function we just created.
[07:43:45] <drvanon> on this website: http://www.authenticsociety.com/blog/jQueryPluginTutorial_Beginner
[07:43:57] <gnarf> ?iife @drvanon
[07:43:57] <bot-t> drvanon, Immediately Invoked Function Expression: http://bit.ly/js-iife
[07:44:07] <drvanon> But I must say I understand very little of it.
[07:44:19] <gnarf> drvanon: effectively it does two things
[07:44:27] <gnarf> #1 - jQuery is passed into the function as $
[07:44:43] <gnarf> so you can safely use $ to reference jQuery, even if $ isn't jQuery in the "global context"
[07:44:46] <Robipo> hm, doesn't seem to work, it acts like a $('a,b') wraping a's and b's each on its own, but i want to wrap them together
[07:45:12] <gnarf> #2 - var's declared inside that function are not global, because they are not in the global namespace.  This stops you from leaking variables into the global namespace
[07:49:20] <gnarf> Robipo: might not be able to use wrap then
[07:50:20] <Robipo> :(
[07:50:23] <gnarf> Robipo: you could do something like $("a+b").each(function() { var inside = $(this).prev().andSelf(); $("<c>").insertBefore(inside).append(inside); });
[07:51:00] <Robipo> wow
[07:52:38] <gnarf> ?
[07:54:20] <Robipo> That's impressive :D (well, at least for a newbie like me)
[07:54:44] <gnarf> only if it works ;)
[07:55:27] <Robipo> Just a slight problem, inside gets duplicated :p
[07:55:49] <gnarf> hrm, it shouldn't
[07:55:54] <gnarf> ?demo @Robipo
[07:55:54] <bot-t> Robipo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:58:02] <gnarf> aha
[07:58:04] <gnarf> found it
[07:58:15] <gnarf> .insertBefore(inside[0])
[07:58:28] <gnarf> it was inserting a new <c> before each of the elements :)
[07:58:47] <b-ot> No output.
[07:59:20] <gnarf> Robipo: http://jsfiddle.net/5J58V/
[07:59:22] <Robipo> Nice! It's working! Thanks a lot (:
[08:00:08] <Robipo> oh, that's a handy tool for trying stuff
[08:03:15] * SparK_BR went lunch
[08:16:20] <abraxxa> why is the combobox widget only in the docs of autocomplete and not included in jquery-ui?
[08:24:04] <Granjow> gnarf: Because I need the argument I pass inside the function, and when using it directly I somehow lose it.
[08:24:24] <gnarf> Granjow: looks smelly
[08:27:36] <Robipo> // btw if someone paid attention to my previous issue, here's another shorter solution to do it : $("a+b").each(function() { $(this).prev().andSelf().wrapAll("<c>"); }
[08:32:14] <starsinmyPOCKETS> I have a form with elements loaded by ajax. Since my script is wrapped in document ready, how can I act on these async elements loaded after the document?
[08:32:36] <defaultro_> good morning folks, I got disconnected. How can this be written in Jquery? http://pastebin.com/xrszVB3j
[08:34:06] <gnarf> defaultro_: see ?jQuery.ajaxPrefilter
[08:34:07] <bot-t> defaultro_, jQuery.ajaxPrefilter([dataTypes], handler): Handle custom Ajax options or modify existing options before each request is sent and before they are processed by $.ajax(). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/
[08:34:17] <defaultro_> awesome!
[08:34:48] <defaultro_> i guess jquery is better since my code is only supported Firefox. Am I right?
[08:35:10] <gnarf> you could do something ala. $.ajaPrefilter(function() { this.done(function(data) { parseEtc(); }); });
[08:35:27] <pachet> starsinmyPOCKETS: that's a rather general question, but see .on() if you're doing event delegation
[08:35:35] <pachet> ?.on() @ starsinmyPOCKETS
[08:35:36] <bot-t> starsinmyPOCKETS, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:35:46] <starsinmyPOCKETS> pachet - roger, thank you
[08:36:05] <gnarf> you actually might need to get the jqXHR from the third argument of the prefilter
[08:36:09] <gnarf> it might not be "this"
[08:36:10] * gnarf shrugs
[08:36:10] <b-ot> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[08:37:12] <gnarf> starsinmyPOCKETS: whenever you ajax in new content you need to bind events inside that content - OR - you can use event delegation on a container
[08:37:30] <gnarf> I kinda halfassed a plugin for doing it the first way
[08:37:32] <gnarf> ?newContent
[08:37:33] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[08:37:38] <starsinmyPOCKETS> gnarf how do I listen for the new dom elements?
[08:37:45] <gnarf> starsinmyPOCKETS: you don't
[08:37:46] <defaultro_> so this ajax prefilter will be able to capture the http response?
[08:37:57] <gnarf> starsinmyPOCKETS: you call a function from wherever you create these dom elements
[08:37:57] <defaultro_> that's what my code I posted is doing
[08:37:59] <gnarf> like
[08:38:08] <gnarf> if in your ajax callback, after you append the data
[08:38:18] <gnarf> you called newElements( content )
[08:38:22] <defaultro_> i don't use ajax to do the call
[08:38:39] <gnarf> and you had function newElements( content ) { content.find(".save-button").on(....); }
[08:38:41] <defaultro_> we call it via api, editor.change.submit();
[08:38:58] <gnarf> defaultro_: so, does "editor"s api give you a callback?
[08:39:02] <defaultro_> no
[08:39:06] <gnarf> bad API
[08:39:15] <gnarf> defaultro_: then, use event delegation
[08:39:18] <defaultro_> yep, they're correcting it in 2 weeks
[08:39:26] <defaultro_> event delegation?
[08:39:38] <gnarf> $("#container").on("click", ".save-button", handler); <-- second argument is a selector
[08:40:09] <gnarf> events "bubble" up so you can catch them on a higher element
[08:41:33] <gnarf> defaultro_: see ?on
[08:41:34] <defaultro_> gnarf: way advance for me right now :)
[08:41:34] <bot-t> defaultro_, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:41:46] <defaultro_> k
[08:41:50] <defaultro_> cool, reading it now
[08:41:53] <gnarf> defaultro_: welcome to javascript / web development then
[08:42:05] <gnarf> defaultro_: if you don't have jquery 1.7
[08:42:09] <gnarf> see ?delegate
[08:42:16] <gnarf> ?delegate
[08:42:16] <defaultro_> we are using 1.7
[08:42:19] <gnarf> awesome
[08:42:23] <gnarf> +1 your company
[08:42:27] <defaultro_> :)
[08:42:32] <gnarf> try 1.8
[08:42:32] <gnarf> ;)
[08:42:37] <defaultro_> :)
[08:42:58] <defaultro_> so that .on will be able to see all http request right?
[08:43:00] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:43:06] <gnarf> defaultro_: no, its events
[08:43:23] <gnarf> so like instead of binding an event like $(".save-button").on("click", handler);
[08:43:26] <gnarf> you can do something like
[08:43:36] <gnarf> $(document).on("click",".save-button", handler);
[08:43:48] <defaultro_> ok. The code I mentioned to you earlier sends a json via http resonse but does not send back the data to the object
[08:43:53] <gnarf> then even if a ".save-button" is created later, it still runs the handler
[08:43:53] <abraxxa> that's also less resource intensive
[08:43:55] <defaultro_> is that still called callback
[08:44:15] <gnarf> find a better target than "document" though
[08:44:30] <gnarf> cuz then it has to process every click, not just clicks inside some container
[08:44:38] <gnarf> defaultro_: this has nothing to do with the ajax request
[08:44:44] <defaultro_> ok
[08:45:03] <gnarf> defaultro_: it is just catching the event you need to bind to from some parent of the area of the page that can be changed by ajax
[08:45:09] <defaultro_> but i need the http response after i execute editor.change.submit()
[08:45:20] <defaultro_> until they fix their api
[08:45:45] <defaultro_> it's like a hack that i mentioned on my pastebin earlier
[08:45:49] <gnarf> defaultro_: without fixing the lib, you're pretty much screwed - do you know anything about the internals of the library? have you like traced the code in a debugger to see if it uses jQuery ajax?
[08:46:21] <defaultro_> gnarf: I just wanted to use jquery in place of my xmlhttprequest code
[08:46:40] <gnarf> really, it should be something like editor.change.submit( function( data ) { }); or editor.change.submit().done( function( data ) { });
[08:46:48] <gnarf> so you can have a callback
[08:46:50] <defaultro_> because my friggin officemate told me why i used xhr, he said it could be done in query
[08:46:50] <gnarf> with data
[08:46:54] <defaultro_> jquery
[08:47:22] <gnarf> defaultro_: if you use ajaxPrefilter, you get a call to your function anytime any jquery ajax occurs
[08:47:26] <defaultro_> that .submit has 2 params
[08:47:37] <defaultro_> ok
[08:47:44] <gnarf> what are the params
[08:47:46] <gnarf> and what does it return
[08:47:51] <gnarf> .submit()
[08:47:53] <defaultro_> let me read the api doc, one sec
[08:49:29] <defaultro_> it says  submit (callback, thisObj)
[08:49:52] <defaultro_> {Function=} 	callback 	the callback function that is called with parameter 'true' when submit successes.
[08:50:06] <defaultro_> that's all for the documentation :(
[08:50:19] <defaultro_> so i only call it .submit()
[08:50:38] <defaultro_> {Object=} 	thisObj 	the callback function at which it is called.
[08:50:41] <defaultro_> that's the other one
[08:53:04] <defaultro_> i'm interested in this, editor.change.submit().done( function( data ) { });
[08:53:28] <gnarf> .submit(function( success ) { });
[08:53:31] <defaultro_> will the data inside parenthese get popuplated?
[08:53:52] <gnarf> defaultro_: that would be if the submit function returned a jqXHR (which would be really smart, you should suggest it)
[08:54:05] <defaultro_> which one?
[08:54:11] <gnarf> the .done()
[08:54:11] <pachet> you can just wrap it to do that :]
[08:54:15] <defaultro_> cool
[08:54:19] <defaultro_> what about this one, .submit(function( success ) { });
[08:54:32] <defaultro_> is this going to work, .submit(function( success ) {  alert(success);});
[08:54:33] <gnarf> that seems to be what the API docs you quoted suggest is possible
[08:54:41] <gnarf> eww alert
[08:54:42] <gnarf> but yes
[08:54:51] <defaultro_> or .submit(function( success ) {  console.log(success);});
[08:54:58] <gnarf> yay!

[09:01:54] <kborchers> gnarf: not sure. have to check with the wife's schedule
[09:02:11] <gnarf> hopefully defaultro_ can make it ;)
[09:02:32] <defaultro_> will do of course :)
[09:02:41] <defaultro_> i'll check the sched later
[09:10:17] <Gates> I am trying to check if there is a line item in a UL, but i cannot get it to work

[09:20:28] <defaultro_> gnarf, you still there?
[09:20:39] <defaultro_> got an error with this,  editor.changes.submit(function( success ) { console.log(success); });
[09:21:09] <gnarf> defaultro_: what kind of error?
[09:21:22] <defaultro_> the error isn't helpful. Firebug just says, uncaught exception: Invalid parameter!
[09:24:01] <pachet> defaultro_: got a line number?
[09:24:15] <defaultro_> line number of the code?
[09:24:58] <pachet> yeah, where the error occurred
[09:25:20] <pachet> its probably buried in your minified jquery so it might not be that helpful
[09:25:58] <defaultro_> no, it's not in jquery. it's on another minified js written by other team
[09:26:27] <SparK_BR> where's the other team?
[09:27:18] <pachet> don't say the phillipines
[09:28:23] <gnarf> defaultro_: sounds like their api doesn
[09:28:28] <gnarf> isn't accurate
[09:29:01] <callumacrae> 1380
[09:29:02] <defaultro_> doesn't what?
[09:29:06] <callumacrae> whoops, wrong channel
[09:29:16] <gnarf> defaultro_: *isn't accurate
[09:29:30] <gnarf> like if the first argument was a callback
[09:29:37] <gnarf> you wouldn't get that error
[09:29:53] <defaultro_> yeah, looks like inaccurate
[09:30:04] <defaultro_> i'm actually doubtful about the doc
[09:30:20] <defaultro_> submit and revert function is doing revert :D
[09:30:30] <defaultro_> on documentation though
[09:31:14] <defaultro_> so that function we inserted as first param is the callback?
[09:31:29] <gnarf> supposedly
[09:31:42] <gnarf> it gets called whenever the submit finishes
[09:31:44] <defaultro_> got it. Then their populate our success variable?
[09:31:57] <defaultro_> oops
[09:32:02] <defaultro_> then they populate ......
[09:32:46] <gnarf> eh ---- how about the function is executed passing the success argument
[09:33:35] <gnarf> defaultro_: imagine:
[09:34:03] <gnarf> function doSomething( callback ) { setTimeout(function(){ callback("I did something"); }, 1000); }
[09:34:25] <gnarf> defaultro_: then doSomething(function( result ) { console.log( result ); });
[09:35:07] <defaultro_> got it
[09:35:32] <defaultro_> amazing example :)
[09:37:06] <gnarf> notice
[09:37:17] <gnarf> even setTimeout takes a "callback" there ;)
[09:37:37] <gnarf> thats basically async programming 101
[09:38:16] <gnarf> deferred is like the 200 level course
[09:38:22] <gnarf> ?jQuery.deferred
[09:38:40] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[09:39:28] <gnarf> defaultro_: ^^^ jQuery's ajax returns a "jqXHR" which is a "promise" - so you can attach any number of callbacks to it... thats why I said you should suggest that they just return the jqXHR
[09:39:49] <defaultro_> will do
[09:40:03] <defaultro_> thanks a lot for the link
[09:44:21] <jomofcw> How can I "check" a radio button with jQuery (i.e. check one, unchecked automaticaly each other of the same name) ?
[09:44:24] <jomofcw> please.
[09:47:13] <shoky> jomofcw: .prop('checked', true)
[09:48:09] <SparK_BR> the browser will do the only one at a time magic
[09:51:04] <exscape> first off: I'm very new to jQuery and "modern" web dev (I did some 7+ years ago). Anyway, I'm trying to get a datepicker to work "over" an image with the Jcrop plugin running. The input field is just above the image, so the datepicker appears over the image. So far so good, but clicks in the datepicker go straight through to the image behind... any ideas on where to start to solve this? it acts exactly as if the datepicker isn't there
[09:51:43] <SparK_BR> event.stopPropagation()
[09:51:50] <SparK_BR> in your click handler
[09:53:04] <exscape> SparK_BR: hmm, it talks about "parent" handlers - is that really applicable to Z issues? if so, which of the two would I have to modify?
[09:53:42] <gnarf> exscape: might want to try using css to inflate the zindex of the datepicker
[09:54:10] <SparK_BR> gnarf, the datepicker shows
[09:54:15] <SparK_BR> but isn't clickable
[09:54:57] <SparK_BR> unless there's a dynamic element for the jcrop that is in a higher z-index
[09:55:41] <gnarf> SparK_BR: thats my thought
[09:55:48] <gnarf> SparK_BR: what happens if you inspect it?
[09:55:58] <gnarf> like right click inspect, do you get the datepicker?
[09:56:14] <exscape> gnarf: I'm the one with the problem :) and no, I get the Jcrop element
[09:56:15] <SparK_BR> exscape?
[09:56:25] <gnarf> SparK_BR: thanks, sorry
[09:56:51] <gnarf> exscape: so you need to use CSS to lift the datepicker element above the Jcrop's zindex
[09:57:40] <pachet> the drought might be affecting your jcrop
[09:57:51] <gnarf> *facepalm*
[09:59:29] <exscape> hmm, it doesn't appear to help. by the way, when I hold the mouse pointer over the datepicker (which in turn is over the jcrop image), the mouse pointer changes to the crosshair jcrop uses
[10:06:14] <starpile> Anyone tell me why this no worky? http://jsfiddle.net/Bh6tq/
[10:07:00] <shoky> click handling on <option>s is known to be wonky

[10:11:50] <starpile> shoky - nice thankyou
[10:12:42] <shoky> starpile: would be better to have value attributes on the <option>s
[10:12:55] <shoky> starpile: then you could just check $(this).val() == 'saab'
[10:13:05] <shoky> on the select
[10:13:40] <shoky> starpile: like this http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Bh6tq/2/
[10:29:29] <w00tner> how can i check if there is internet in a mobile device ?

[10:32:24] <pachet> w00tner: you have to pry it open and look inside

[10:40:28] <fkreusch> I'm running an ajax call that returns a javascript code, which runs fine, but if I force an error in the returned javascript (like throw "Something"), nothing is shown up in the browser console; I have found some places mentioning that jquery silently fails in those situations. Is there any way to force it to raise on errors?
[10:45:13] <w00tner> i wrote a jquery mobile app and made it native  with phonegap... it uses a json file to keep it upgraded and read info, i want to detect if there is a internet conection to download the file and store it locally in the device
[10:45:39] <w00tner> and if there is no internet just read the local file and problem solved
[10:45:40] <NoiseEee> w00tner: see b-ot's link
[10:45:55] <w00tner> thanks b-ot
[10:47:09] <pachet> ?eval "you're welcome"
[10:47:09] <b-ot> pachet, no YOU'RE welcome"
[10:47:13] <w00tner> and then just set a button than check conection, downloads the file and overwrite the local file
[10:47:58] <w00tner> the app is actualy on my android phone now, im dancing
[10:48:00] <w00tner> not naked but dancing
[10:55:49] <GoSox> i'm using $(this).parent().prepend("<li>") to add a new list item to the beginning of a list, when another list item is clicked.
[10:56:08] <GoSox> and it is working, but how can i animate the new item with a slideUp() so it comes in slowly
[10:58:10] <shoky> GoSox: var item = $('<li/>');  then you can do whatever you want with it
[10:59:10] <GoSox> i don't know what you mean
[11:00:02] <pachet> he means store a reference to that element before you prepend it
[11:00:42] <pachet> var $new_li = $('<li/>'); $(this).parent().prepend($new_li); $new_li.doWhatever()
[11:02:47] <GoSox> and would i just throw a style attribute making the list item invisible as i create the reference so i can slide it up into view via this reference
[11:03:02] <shoky> .hide() works too
[11:03:25] <GoSox> hmm ok let me see if this works
[11:03:25] <Hopsy> I want to do $(this) inside $.ajax()
[11:03:30] <Hopsy> how should I do this?
[11:04:25] <shoky> Hopsy: var $this = $(this); before the $.ajax call
[11:04:26] <gnarf> Hopsy: store a reference to it in the outer scope and use it inside... var element = $(this); ... jQuery.ajax(.....).done(function(){ element.addClass("done"); });
[11:05:29] <Hopsy> things are so simple sometimes :(
[11:06:40] <shoky> why'd they have to be like that?!?
[11:08:24] <GoSox> seems to be working well, thanks
[11:09:57] <Neurotiquette> Hey, I'm looking to make one of those annoying nag screens via javascript that obscures the background and prevents the user from closing said modal or accessing whats behind it (aside from editing the DOM in webkit or something)‚Ä¶ this nag screen will be for the purpose of legal compliance. I recall mercola.com used to have an annoying one for their email newsletter. Anyone know of a tutorial well fitted for this?
[11:10:05] <Neurotiquette> Or any tips or otherwise?
[11:11:47] <NoiseEee> Neurotiquette: basically just have a <div> overlay the screen with an opacity set, and then a modal/other <div> on top of that
[11:14:40] <GoSox> you need a plugin to work with cookies? It's not built into jquery?
[11:14:43] <GoSox> that seems odd
[11:16:02] <shoky> does it
[11:16:20] <GoSox> unless this page i'm reading is just really wrong
[11:17:15] <NoiseEee> GoSox: its built into javascript, but not jquery
[11:18:16] <Neurotiquette> NoiseEee: That makes sense. Just absolute position it to top: 0px, and set a height equal to the outerHeight of the body tag?
[11:19:07] <NoiseEee> for the most part iirc, you can see how various modal box scripts do it, or peek at the NYTimes markup after viewing 10 articles, etc
[11:19:18] <shoky> 100% would do
[11:19:33] <NoiseEee> most likely a jquery plugin exists but i have little experience with plugins
[11:19:57] <Neurotiquette> NoiseEee: Ahh! Ny times does it. Good to know, thanks. My difficulty is I knew what I was looking for, but couldn't find a good example of it‚Ä¶ one of the few sites that I knew that used to do it quit doing it (which is actually a good thing -- its annoying!)
[11:19:58] <NoiseEee> cruise http://iwantaneff.in/repo/ maybe
[11:29:10] <Neurotiquette> NoiseEee: What is this site? Looks like it's got some hype-cool-shiznat.
[11:31:02] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone
[11:31:14] <jarr0dsz> would it be possible to do a append and load somehow? i try to combine them to no avail
[11:31:24] <NoiseEee> Neurotiquette: just another collection of jquery plugins
[11:32:01] <jarr0dsz> or perhaps assign the loaded value to a var and print it in my append? any tricks for that one could use
[11:32:20] <Neurotiquette> Very well made ones it would appear, NoiseEee
[11:34:06] <shoky> jarr0dsz you could append and .load to what you already appended, or you could just use $.ajax and do exactly what you want in the callback
[11:34:37] <jarr0dsz> shoky: you mean in 1 single line instead of 2 ? ;p
[11:34:56] <shoky> what?
[11:35:44] <jarr0dsz> how do you mean append and load to what i have already appended?
[11:35:52] <jarr0dsz> i can load or append not both
[11:36:32] <GoSox> anyone know where to GET the jquery cookie plugin? I can't seem to find a live link to it
[11:36:37] <shoky> var newEl = $('<div/>');  newEl.appendTo('body').load(...)
[11:36:57] <GoSox> nevermiiiiind found it
[11:37:37] <jarr0dsz> i now have something like http://pastie.org/private/9aryvqdg2itwpf5hqw0g0a wich is quite a bit messy
[11:37:56] <jarr0dsz> im loading a timer in with load but i want to keep the text string in there wich is replaced with the time now
[11:38:36] <shoky> umm. .load is asynchronous and returns immediately
[11:39:08] <shoky> so putting it before that fadeIn won't do much
[11:39:31] <muzone> b_52globe salaaaaaaaaaaam ya habibi
[11:39:48] <muzone> what up young roots
[11:39:50] <shoky> jarr0dsz: anyway simplest to just use $.ajax instead of .load
[11:39:58] <shoky> jarr0dsz: then you have full control
[11:39:59] <muzone> hows the african desert
[11:40:21] <defaultro_> gnarf: I got disconnected, please send me the rockford meetup link. Thanks
[11:40:40] <jarr0dsz> shoky: how would it look if you would use @.ajax? look for a example in @.ajax div replacement with timer?
[11:41:18] <shoky> sorry gtg

[11:45:44] <pachet> might be using the wrong kind of buzzer

[11:48:07] <GoSox> steal('jquery/lang/json',function() {
[11:49:44] <gabebug> I'm working with an application framework that's making inputs like <input id="foo$$c" />. attempting to reference it as $('#foo$cc') returns an empty result. is there any way to specify a selector that finds by the id name?
[11:49:55] <wachpwnski> maybe on document load
[11:50:48] <NoiseEee> GoSox: use https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[11:51:18] <bot-t> gabebug, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[11:52:02] <gabebug> bot-t: thank you!
[11:52:03] <bot-t> gabebug, I'm a bot you know..
[11:56:19] <wachpwnski> how do I set opacity like fadeTo without fading?
[12:00:12] <tubbo> wachpwnski: $('#el').animate({opacity: '0.0'})
[12:00:18] <tubbo> iirc
[12:00:26] <Guest51529> hello
[12:00:50] <tubbo> fadeOut and fadeIn are just aliases to animate({opacity: 0}); hide() and animate({opacity: 1}); show(), respectively
[12:00:52] <WebDragon> hey question.. for use in responsive design, does jquery have methods to do the css media queries so it can know when/whether to fire off certain effects?
[12:01:00] <asker> hey guys, i have multiple events which all triggers the same function. whats the best way to do this? i have been told that creating js functions is a bad style working with jquery
[12:01:26] <WebDragon> asker: who told you that?
[12:01:36] <asker> a coder at work
[12:01:39] <tubbo> asker: that's a really huge generalization to make. javascript is mostly a functional language, so it's kinda like saying "yeah you can write in java but you can't use a class"
[12:01:48] <WebDragon> heh exactly
[12:01:58] <tubbo> asker: perhaps he was commenting on the WAY you create JS functions ;) gist.github.com a sample of your function?
[12:02:20] * tubbo personally likes jQuery plugins when dealing with one-off functions...especially if their only argument is a jQuery object
[12:02:37] <Guest51529> hahaha
[12:02:57] <asker> https://gist.github.com/3709130
[12:02:59] <Guest51529> how to?
[12:03:03] <asker> i would do it like that, is that ok?
[12:03:09] <asker> or is it kind of bad?
[12:03:10] <tubbo> can't tell you how many times i had to debug function hideArticle(post) { post.hide() }, when it could have just been $.fn.hidePost = function() { $(this).hide() };
[12:03:37] <tubbo> asker: nope, that's exactly the way a function should be used, actually
[12:03:47] <tubbo> functions are for encapsulating useful bits of code to reuse later
[12:03:52] <Guest51529> it easy?go google
[12:04:11] <Zzaichik> The whole premise behind functions is so you don't have to rewrite code..
[12:04:15] <asker> so there is no better way to make it work ?
[12:04:51] <tubbo> asker: nah, you're on the right path. your only other option is to make it a jQuery plugin, which works exactly like a function except it's inherently tied to a jQuery object
[12:05:26] <asker> well ok, never made own plugins
[12:05:27] <asker> :p
[12:05:39] <tubbo> asker: in the case of that function, it looks like you want to scroll to a given point, and resize to the same point, so i don't see any other way to do that if you need to calculate those values
[12:05:55] <tubbo> asker: check out the guide: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[12:05:59] <tubbo> very useful
[12:06:08] <asker> js & jquery i always treated bad, hardly anybody making it rly good&nice, everyone is just quick&dirty with js
[12:06:59] <asker> well i have a floating div at the bottom of the panel, so it has to move to into the vision of user when he resizes window or scroll
[12:07:07] <tubbo> asker: big misconception with JS is that "smaller is always better". wrong. having something _READABLE_ is *always* better.
[12:07:09] <nisseni> is there an easy way to let a user use both dot and comma, and still get a calculation right?
[12:07:34] <tubbo> asker: n00bs get crazy b/c they can do so much with so few lines of code, especially Java heads
[12:07:45] <asker> well i know, its not only in js this way, but stil... i always design my phpproject rly nice, js... well ... :p
[12:07:49] <tubbo> or people who are used to "real" programming, like compiled software and shit
[12:08:10] <tubbo> asker: and plenty of people don't really understand JS or how to debug it, so they are doing little more than copy-pasting code they've seen elsewhere
[12:08:31] <tubbo> out of everyone at my job, i am the only one who understands JS enough to comfortably debug other people's code and write my own shit
[12:08:42] <GoSox> can I found out which item $(this) is in it's parent? Like if it's the first, second, third list item etc?
[12:08:43] <tubbo> whenever people have javascript questions, they talk to me
[12:08:43] <asker> well , how to debug it? i just output vars etc dont know any other way
[12:08:53] <tubbo> and i'm not really a GREAT javascript dev, i just know more than they do, and that's leaps and bounds
[12:09:05] <asker> :D
[12:09:15] <tubbo> asker: debugger; in Chrome will open CDT to the point in your code where you call it, you can then set other breakpoints in the code to "step through" your shiut
[12:09:27] <tubbo> asker: it's useful if you want to get into a function and see what the value of one of its args is
[12:09:31] <asker> i have been told console.log() is the way to go at not this big tasks
[12:10:03] <tubbo> asker: yeah, console.log() is nice for outputting dev information but i almost never put a console.log in my real code. i always type it out in the console itself, because i use debugger; to get to the point in code that i want to see values of
[12:10:07] <asker> obv shit is your fav word :D
[12:10:16] <tubbo> asker: javascript is shit.
[12:10:17] <tubbo> ;)
[12:10:30] <nisseni> is there an easy way to let a user use both dot and comma, and still get a calculation right?
[12:10:31] <asker> haha
[12:10:43] <tubbo> nisseni: huh?
[12:10:46] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ asker
[12:10:51] <asker> ok i will inform myself about debugging in js, anyway ty for help
[12:10:59] <NoiseEee> nisseni: strip out commas before calculating?
[12:11:22] <nisseni> tubbo: I'm having a user write a number with decimals, now in sweden we use , not . as decimal, but the calculation doesn't work with ,
[12:11:23] <tubbo> asker: seriously the difference between a bad JS programmer and a great JS programmer is their ability to debug it.
[12:11:24] <asker> ok i will to thru NoiseEee
[12:11:39] <tubbo> nisseni: shit i think you should move away from Sweden then and join the rest of the world ;)
[12:11:40] <nisseni> I've tried to replace, but that doesn't go to well
[12:11:49] <asker> ok have a nice evening guys

[12:12:49] <WebDragon> hey question.. for use in responsive design, does jquery have methods to do the css media queries so it can know when/whether to fire off certain effects?
[12:13:58] <nisseni> tubbo: 1 000,50
[12:14:07] <nisseni> or 1.000,50
[12:14:12] <tubbo> oh i see
[12:17:00] <Zzaichik> are you dealing with currency?

[12:57:35] <SparK_BR> can you get me out of Brazil? I have no passport
[12:57:35] <wachpwnski> What kind of job?
[12:58:10] <wachpwnski> SparK_BR:  What is with you brazilians wanting out so bad? :D
[12:58:46] <wachpwnski> You have beautiful women, capoeria, jiu-jitsu, beaches and surfing.
[12:59:05] <SparK_BR> our gov steals and media say it's normal, most people don't care about it and when we care they say shutup
[12:59:27] <SparK_BR> aaaand the country is much larger than just the beach
[12:59:47] <SparK_BR> beaches are where people are the most annoying and alienated
[13:00:13] <SparK_BR> their "swag" and "cool-factor" is just plain dumb
[13:00:55] <SparK_BR> and I like cold
[13:01:06] <tubbo> other than the beaches brazil is literally jamaica
[13:01:14] <tubbo> from what i've seen (in pictures)
[13:01:23] <SparK_BR> like, big cities?
[13:01:33] <SparK_BR> I don't know jamaica
[13:02:18] <defaultro_> sorry gnarf , I got disconnected again. I'm not sure if you saw my post abou half an hour ago. I was asking for the Rockford meetup link. Thanks

[13:03:23] <SparK_BR> the problem is not the place

I was using class only(just for fun0 without any Is. problem is if you click on third and fourth image after page is loaded second picture is loaded after that everyhing works ok
[13:14:25] <brettfrable> hey yeall
[13:15:18] <brettfrable> http://horizons.com.s152869.gridserver.com/ - scroll down - click services - you'll see the page scrolls back up. Now I know this is happening because jquery .hide is emptying the div
[13:15:20] <brettfrable> but i don
[13:15:26] <brettfrable> 't want that to happen
[13:15:33] <brettfrable> i'd like the window to stay positioned where it is.
[13:26:22] <xckpd7> is there any presentation or guide on using templating (not jQuery)? Having trouble finding a straight forward resource
[13:29:35] <le_gars> hi! I have a problem with trying to get the text from inside pre tags that are in a conf file in plain text‚Ä¶anyone care to help .9
[13:30:37] <le_gars> Im retrieving the conf file through the $.get method cos its on another domain
[13:31:50] <le_gars> Ive tried doing like $(variable).contents().find("pre");
[13:35:27] <arser> le_gars: can you post a jsfiddle?
[13:37:01] <Trudko_> Guys please take a look at this simple code http://jsfiddle.net/k6sD5/23/ Basicly if you click on thumbnail right img should be shown. I was using class only(just for fun0 without any Is. problem is if you click on third and fourth image after page is loaded second picture is loaded after that everyhing works ok
[13:40:10] <le_gars> sure.
[13:40:39] <le_gars> arser: here it is http://jsfiddle.net/nWDDV/ I have uncomment the lines that do not work.
[13:40:45] <le_gars> thanks
[13:40:53] <arielserafini_> le_gars: i changed my nick, but i'll take a look
[13:42:08] <le_gars> basically when I console.log the result I have the whole document then I would like to get the HEX values that are in the pre tags and insert them into the DOM and use the colours
[13:42:51] <le_gars> ok thanks a lot arielserafini
[13:42:53] <arielserafini_> Trudko_: not sure I understood your problem. clicking on thumbs works for me
[13:43:09] <seich> Trudko_: if they share classes why don't you just use a selector instead of that weird loop near the end?
[13:43:20] <Trudko_> seich: what do you mean?
[13:43:35] <Trudko_> arielserafini_: after loading click on third thumbnail and see that second img was shown and not third
[13:44:05] <arielserafini_> le_gars: what does the conf file looks like?
[13:44:16] <arielserafini_> look like*
[13:47:54] <rdavila> Hi folks, I've a question, I've a form which is rendered via client side(I'm using backbone) and when I try to focus an input from the console it doesn't work: $('#input_id').focus()
[13:48:29] <Trudko_> arielserafini_: do u see the bug now?
[13:48:35] <rdavila> the input exists and the id is uniq, why focus() don't work?
[13:48:54] <arielserafini_> Trudko_: yeah
[13:49:30] <Trudko_> but i thinki should change whole approach does not like my one
[13:49:42] <arielserafini_> Trudko_: i'm rewriting it a bit, just a sec
[13:50:04] <SparK_BR> Trudko_, "my one" = "mine"
[13:50:18] <SparK_BR> I used to be an english teacher =D
[13:50:40] <Trudko_> SparK_BR: thx :) feel free to correct ! I prefer that actually
[13:51:11] <Trudko_> plus I am kind of person who corrects other if they say something gramatically wrong in my language, i had strict language teacher :)
[13:52:01] <SparK_BR> the kind* others* a strict*
[13:52:05] <SparK_BR> :P
[13:52:21] <SparK_BR> I can correct you but won't remember the "why"s
[13:54:10] <arielserafini_> Trudko_: what's your native language?
[13:54:21] <Trudko_> Slovakian
[13:54:27] <seich> Trudko_: how about something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/p6S2m/3/
[13:54:38] <seich> I replaced the loop with a selector
[13:54:43] <Trudko_> SparK_BR: heh yeah :D you will have to much work with me anyways
[13:54:47] <Trudko_> anyway
[13:54:49] <nisseni> is there a simple way to say if $('element1').change or $('element2').change ?
[13:55:20] <SparK_BR> too much*
[13:55:24] <seich> nisseni: like the change event?
[13:55:44] <seich> nisseni: if that's the case you could have them both trigger the same event
[13:55:54] <le_gars> arielserafini_ : do u mean the structure? It is a basic HTML document with only a pre tag in the body with some HEX colour values inside
[13:55:59] <Trudko_> seich: lol thx that is much simplier
[13:56:09] <NoiseEee> nisseni: give them a class name to share... $('.className').on('change',function() { etc });
[13:56:12] <nisseni> seich: I'm listening :)
[13:56:21] <SparK_BR> function handler(event){};
[13:56:22] <nisseni> NoiseEee: aah, good idea
[13:56:30] <nisseni> too tired!
[13:56:36] <SparK_BR> $('element1, element2').change(handler);
[13:57:24] <seich> nisseni: either SparK_BR or NoiseEee solution, should work x
[13:57:41] <seich> Trudko_: You're welcome :) I am glad I could help
[13:57:51] <Trudko_> seich: whats this line for     imgClass = imgClass; ?
[13:58:02] <SparK_BR> lol
[13:58:19] <seich> Trudko_: lol xD Nothing, I forgot to remove it
[13:58:50] <Trudko_> ;)
[14:01:26] <nisseni> from a usability point of view, what do you guys think on this one: A user gets to type in variables in 3 different output, these are calculated and gives a "Total sum", is it better to have a "Update totals"-button, or have a .change() ?
[14:01:36] <nisseni> 3 different inputs*
[14:02:17] <nisseni> I have tonage price, a tax percentage on that and amount of tons, so the total sum will be quite fk:ed up after one input
[14:02:36] <Trudko_> seich: ok so you just take  last class which is unique of clicked thumnail find large image  with same class you show it and hide the rest clever
[14:02:37] <MistuhKurtz> i think it's nice to have it auto-update on input change
[14:02:45] <Trudko_> or I am that stupid :/ :D
[14:03:15] <seich> Trudko_: that's exactly what I am doing. I am just looking for the element with the same class as the clicked image in the original's div
[14:03:43] <arielserafini_> le_gars: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/nWDDV/2/
[14:03:44] <seich> nisseni: you can just check if all values have been typed, if they haven't don't calculate the final price
[14:04:03] <arielserafini_> going home, brb
[14:04:16] <nisseni> seich: true...
[14:04:48] <nisseni> seich: but talking from a usability perspective, is it "better" to make an action rather than tab, in order to get a sum?
[14:06:22] <seich> nisseni: I think that having a button saying "calculate" would probably be more useable. Since people have to think less.
[14:06:39] <nisseni> seich: kinda my opinion as well :)
[14:07:35] <seich> nisseni: ;)
[14:08:55] <le_gars> arielserafini_: thanks problem is though is as it is cross domain I'm getting a Origin http://localhost/ is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin when I'm doing load.
[14:10:55] <Trudko_> seich: and how about this i would have to arrows for going through images if you click on > arrrow image to right would be shown if you click on < the other previous one whould be show. if you click on > on last image first is shown and vice versa
[14:11:49] <Trudko_> seich: i was thinking -I would find img whis is not hidden using next i would show the next one and hide last one + if  shown image is last one i would show first child or last depending on arrow
[14:12:16] <seich> Trudko_: That could work but, I think it would add a lot of code to your script
[14:12:46] <seich> Trudko_: if you can guarantee all elements will have they original and thumbnail in the same position, you could use their index
[14:13:30] <Trudko_> seich: hmm not sure what do you mean
[14:13:42] <Trudko_> seich: btw how long have you been working with jquery?
[14:13:51] <seich> Trudko_: or, which is what I would probably end up doing, you could add a "data-index" attribut to the thumbnails and the originals, and then keep track of the current index and change it and hide all but the images with that given index
[14:14:11] <seich> Trudko_: a couple of years now I guess,
[14:14:22] <seich> Trudko_: I am not a pro yet x)
[14:14:25] <Trudko_> seich: would work but I am not supposed to change html ;)
[14:14:28] <Trudko_> seich: heh
[14:14:49] <seich> Trudko_: hmm, ok, let me try something
[14:14:58] <Trudko_> thx a lot
[14:26:29] <Trudko_> seich: still there ?
[14:28:21] <seich> Trudko_: check it out: http://jsfiddle.net/p6S2m/7/
[14:28:29] <seich> Trudko_: I simplified the code a lot xD
[14:29:16] <seich> Trudko_: check this one: http://jsfiddle.net/p6S2m/8/ it has a small correction
[14:30:43] <Trudko_> seich: anything I can help you with  ? :D
[14:32:18] <seich> Trudko_: I am fine :) You're helping me kill time, I've been doing nothing for a couple of hours now xD
[14:32:35] <Trudko_> lol heh
[14:33:15] <Trudko_> i have to be honest with you this is actually assignemt for job i am applying, it is great opportunity for me, but it seems i will have to fake it till i make it
[14:33:56] <Trudko_> seich: do you think there is something else i could add(by my own now) some new feature to that?
[14:34:09] <Trudko_> maybe some nice animation i know jquey has animate function
[14:34:24] <seich> Trudko_: how about you make it so it highlights the current thumbnail?
[14:34:52] <Trudko_> seich: highlight like for example make nice border around it?
[14:35:12] <seich> Trudko_: yep
[14:35:24] <Trudko_> could it be possible to make such a border that after you click it gets little bigger and then fades away a bit if you know what i mean
[14:36:47] <seich> Trudko_: yes, it is possible
[14:36:50] <Trudko_> and i could add some arrows to the sides or bottm
[14:37:09] <Trudko_> or no to the sides and the could disspaear on mouseover out
[14:37:16] <seich> Trudko_: sure, why not x)
[14:37:36] <Trudko_> oks i am gonna make coffe for that first :)
[14:38:52] <seich> Trudko_: x) awesome, tell me if you get stuck with anything, I'll be hanging around here
[14:40:03] <Trudko_> seich: oks ;0
[14:47:25] <Trudko_> seich: btw arent you working on your own projects/
[14:48:19] <seich> Trudko_: I am work now but, for some reason, there's nothing for me to do today, so I've been doing nothing for the past couple of hours
[14:48:49] <seich> Trudko_: well, more like reading about random stuff, like xmpp and such. I was considering building a server with node or something while I wait for the day to be over.. x|
[14:49:10] <seich> Trudko_: I kind of hate these days, they are so boring...
[14:49:13] <Trudko_> where are u from btw?
[14:49:27] <Trudko_> yeah dont have something like that in my work like ever :D
[14:49:48] <arielserafini> seich: i just spent an entire day doing nothing
[14:49:49] <arielserafini> :/
[14:50:03] <arielserafini> it's so damn boring
[14:51:23] <Trudko_> yeah you need plan b for times like these for example I like to study ethics if I am not programming or learning about it
[14:53:03] <rns> I am trying to use the jquery formatCurrency library, but the text inputs changes to blank on blur instead of formatting it.  Any ideas?  http://code.google.com/p/jquery-formatcurrency/
[14:55:33] <donkeycongo> On a click-event, is it possible to check whether the clicked element was in fact a child-element? Specifically I need to make sure that .click() breaks when the input is selected in <a href="#">Link <input type="text"/></a>
[14:55:38] <shadykhan> if im pulling a title from a json feed and im pulling a price of $99.99 how do i remove the $ from being pulled?
[14:56:20] <seich> arielserafini: yeah, agreed. :|
[14:56:32] <seich> Trudko_: I am from Honduras ;O
[14:56:52] <Trudko_> that is freaking far :D
[14:57:06] <seich> lol xD I know right
[14:57:10] <Trudko_> whats average pay for developer there?
[14:57:21] <seich> hmm, tbh, I am not sure
[14:57:40] <seich> I've mostly worked as a freelancer for international clients
[14:58:08] <seich> and I don't get paid here, I have an agreement where they pay for my college tuition
[14:58:35] <Trudko_> seich: thats great i guess cost of living is not that huge in honduras is it
[14:58:44] <Trudko_> ou ok
[14:58:46] <seich> Trudko_: which is about 8k, or roughly 400usd
[14:59:03] <Trudko_> per semester.
[14:59:05] <Trudko_> ?
[14:59:09] <seich> Trudko_: per month
[14:59:16] <Trudko_> full time?
[14:59:23] <seich> Trudko_ it's a nice salary for a part-time job I guess
[14:59:34] <shadykhan> if im pulling a title from a json feed and im pulling a price of $99.99 how do i remove the $ from being pulled?
[14:59:36] <Trudko_> yeah not bad I guess
[14:59:58] <Trudko_> not sure what is cost of living in honduras
[15:00:01] <seich> Trudko_: I only have to work 4 hours a day and get a easy life since I get to spend the money I'd use on college on other stuff
[15:00:14] <shoky> ?js "$99.99".slice(1)
[15:00:17] <Trudko_> thats great and you get experience
[15:00:33] <bot-t> shoky: No output. (Process Killed)
[15:00:49] <shoky> ?eval "$99.99".slice(1)
[15:00:52] <bot-t> shoky: "99.99"
[15:01:24] <seich> Trudko_: yep. I really like my job, I'd do it for free, tbh, I don't really need the money but, I really like having a steady stream of stuff to do
[15:01:53] <seich> Trudko_: Freelancing isn't as constant and being on your own at an empty apartment gets old very fast
[15:02:46] <Trudko_> seich: on the other hand personal i dont enjoy going to work every day i do miss some stuff
[15:03:51] <seich> Trudko_: I miss having the time to work on personal projects, since I am leaving home at 6am and getting back at like 7pm xD so there's barely any free time for me after homework and assignments
[15:04:10] <seich> Trudko_ but other than that, I love working with web stuff all day
[15:04:27] <Trudko_> so you work and study?
[15:04:39] <Trudko_> thats why you get back so late?!
[15:04:42] <seich> Trudko_: yep xD
[15:11:25] <Trudko_> seich: ok it seems that would have to have bit more time to do animation stuff
[15:12:01] <Trudko_> i need to send them the code at morning and it is midnight already:/
[15:13:43] <seich> Trudko_: if you are good at staying up all night, you still have plenty of time ;o
[15:13:52] <Trudko_> ;) thats the spirit
[15:14:09] <Trudko_> I will try to do this ; http://www.photoshop-plus.co.uk/content/tutorials/greyscale_color_transition/demo/demo.html
[15:14:11] <Trudko_> it looks nice
[15:16:29] <seich> Trudko_: oh, that looks really cool
[15:27:45] <Trudko_> seich: btw I did it for one image but according to tutorial images do have absolute position so they ar eon the top http://jsfiddle.net/p6S2m/18/
[15:29:16] <donkeycongo> On a click-event, is it possible to check whether the clicked element was in fact a child-element? Specifically I need to make sure that .click() breaks when the input is selected in <a href="#">Link <input type="text"/></a>
[15:29:19] <Keu> I'm trying to get an event to scroll to the top of the page but it is not working. I'm using $('body').scrollTop(0); is this incorrect?
[15:29:32] <seich> Trudko_: hmm, let me see
[15:32:25] <seich> Trudko_: I changed a couple of things, check it out: http://jsfiddle.net/seich/p6S2m/19/
[15:32:54] <Trudko_> what did you changed?
[15:33:33] <arielserafini> a
[15:34:21] <seich> check the last two definitions
[15:35:09] <Trudko_> you added relative position to product
[15:37:21] <seich> yep
[15:37:27] <seich> I also removed top and left coordinates
[15:40:11] <Trudko_> seich: out of couriosity do you have paypall?
[15:40:59] <seich> Trudko_: yep xD it gives me peace of mind when buying stuff online
[15:41:47] <Trudko_> seich: hmm I want to make it suprising somehow but i dont know how so I will be direct :D give me they paypall so i can at least buy a beer vodka juice what ever you drink :D
[15:42:17] <Trudko_> did not use it for long so I just hope there are not extra secret payments to your country/from my country
[15:43:05] <Trudko_> btw how much does a beer costs ther?
[15:43:34] <nebmo> i've put together a radio button toggle for showing/hiding table rows. it works in FireFox but not in IE. http://jsfiddle.net/hPm6P/. what is wrong with this page? thanks.
[15:45:40] <seich> Trudko_: a beer is like 2usd around here xD
[15:46:02] <Trudko_> seich: for some reason i thought it would be cheeper heh ;d
[15:46:05] <Trudko_> cheaper
[15:46:46] <seich> it's like 45 bucks, which is a little over 2 bucks
[15:47:16] <seich> Trudko_: but, don't worry about it, I enjoy helping you ;) it's a lot of fun for me
[15:47:45] <seich> Trudko_: and just knowing you wanted you to buy me one is more than enough xD
[15:47:50] <Trudko_> i appreciate that but if everything will go well i will get job
[15:48:02] <Trudko_> with good pay
[15:48:26] <Trudko_> so you see my moral dillema :)
[15:48:38] <seich> Trudko_: lol xD I see
[15:49:05] <muzone> hey
[15:49:24] <muzone> http://soundcloud.com/user5596725/muzone-norcan-v0-01
[15:50:01] <Trudko_> seich:  still I am supprised by price o beer i would expect  south/middle america to be quite cheap
[15:50:21] <rns> anyone know why the format currency script works on the text input at the top, but not on the "Rent" text input?  On the rent input after inputting the number the text box goes blank.  http://jsfiddle.net/gnBxd/
[15:51:08] <seich> Trudko_: yeah I know, Honduras likes doing that
[15:51:16] <seich> Trudko_: how much is beer around there?
[15:52:28] <Trudko_> seich: i live in slovakia which is middle europe and its like 1 euro in student bars and around 1.5 to better beers
[15:53:18] <seich> Trudko_: ah, I see, it's a lot cheaper then xD
[15:53:21] <Trudko_> seich: but thats for my town which is second biggest but less expensive then our capital so i am sure it would be more expensive there on avarage
[15:53:25] <nebmo> does this work in IE for anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/hPm6P/. i'm on a mac.
[15:53:42] <nebmo> most likely not, but i dont know whats wrong with the jquery
[15:54:39] <seich> Trudko_: I am at the capital atm, which is fairly expensive I guess
[15:54:44] <clh> folks, are there any good jquery-based frameworks for making resizable/draggable dashlets?  like in splunk, good data, et al?  most of those use frames for the internal content, but have some sort of widget framework wrapped around them .. I used yui used a good bit, but we are jquery all the way
[15:55:16] <seich> Trudko_: Not nearly as expensive as the city I am from, which is kind of a very turistic spot so everything is freaking expensive D:
[15:56:26] <seich> clh: I don't know any full featured solution :| but you could try something like this: http://gridster.net/ and expand it so it works for you
[15:57:18] <Trudko_> seich: I can see that you got lovely beaches
[15:57:46] <Trudko_> seich: whats the name of town you are from? i am from here  https://www.google.sk/search?q=slovakia&sugexp=chrome,mod%3D19&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=sk&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=UBNRUIfoOYzFtAaYsoGwAg&biw=1280&bih=732&sei=UhNRULuuDY7jtQbHx4CoAg#um=1&hl=sk&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=+kosice+&oq=+kosice+&gs_l=img.3..0l10.3194.6689.0.6917.12.6.5.0.0.0.116.444.5j1.6.0...0.0...1c.1.ZcpVhOHLojs&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&fp=471ae8d82aedd5d2&biw=
[15:57:52] <seich> Trudko_: yep xD I am from La Ceiba, which is basically a 16km ferry ride to the bay islands, which is awesome!
[15:58:09] <Trudko_> screw you ! :D I am jealous
[15:58:24] <Trudko_> you should buy ME a beer lol :D
[15:58:46] <seich> Trudko_: xD I am at Tegucigalpa now, the capital, which is fairly gray and boring though :( and awful in general
[15:59:24] <Trudko_> seich: yeah I know that feeling we were communist country until 1989 and those idiots build only large ugly apartment buildings
[15:59:26] <seich> Trudko_: Kosice looks beautiful. I'd love to live in a place like that xD
[15:59:34] <Trudko_> seich: yeah center is pretty nice
[15:59:45] <seich> Trudko_: I love that kind of historic looking city
[15:59:50] <Trudko_> seich: but I have to confese that o prefer prague more
[16:00:09] <Trudko_> prague is beautiful and wien looks cool too but i just love prague
[16:00:21] <clh> seich: thanks, taking a look
[16:00:32] <seich> Trudko_: it does look lovely x)
[16:00:43] <seich> clh: sure, no problem, I hope it helps.
[16:03:33] <Trudko_> seich: btw  if you are on first image you have to double click to get to last one http://jsfiddle.net/seich/p6S2m/19/
[16:04:20] <seich> Trudko_: hmm, let's see
[16:06:37] <seich> Trudko_: ah, I see, it's because you added another image xD so the thumbnail img count has increased
[16:06:47] <Trudko_> ^^^
[16:07:10] <Trudko_> so we need to divide it by two i guess/
[16:07:41] <Trudko_> yeap that did the trick
[16:08:28] <Trudko_> btw i have those two arrows at the top and whats the best way to position right arrow to the right from what i remember from css there is float or position attribute http://jsfiddle.net/p6S2m/24/
[16:08:59] <seich> Trudko_: http://jsfiddle.net/seich/p6S2m/23/
[16:09:17] <seich> Trudko_: I think this is a better solution.
[16:09:34] <Trudko_> yeap
[16:09:35] <seich> Trudko_: just counting .products, since that's the container.
[16:09:44] <BenjaminRH> I'm having a problem with some jQuery code I'm trying to make work
[16:10:08] <seich> BenjaminRH: what's the problem?
[16:10:16] <BenjaminRH> on my site http://www.breastcancerchecklist.com/ I have a section at the bottom with a list of links that loads a new image in the panel next to it
[16:10:23] <BenjaminRH> the way I'm doing it is
[16:10:33] <BenjaminRH> I have only one image tag in the div
[16:10:44] <BenjaminRH> and then when a link is clicked, I change the source attribute of that image
[16:10:52] <BenjaminRH> I queue:
[16:10:53] <rns> anyone know how I can use the formatted numbers to submit the actual number (not the formatted representation) via a form? http://www.bendewey.com/code/formatcurrency/demo/
[16:11:01] <BenjaminRH> fade out the image, change the source, and fade it back in
[16:11:07] <seich> Trudko_: I don't see the arrows ._.
[16:11:12] <BenjaminRH> my problem is that it fades out, the same image fades back in
[16:11:14] <seich> Trudko_: either way should work I guess
[16:11:19] <BenjaminRH> and then it switches a second later
[16:11:28] <Trudko_> http://jsfiddle.net/p6S2m/24/
[16:11:44] <Trudko_> thats last thing i will do i am tired
[16:12:02] <seich> Trudko_: xD  what time is it? 1?
[16:12:06] <BenjaminRH> I think it might be because the browser takes a moment for the image to change whereas jQuery just goes to the next item when it's finished switching the text in source attribute
[16:12:26] <BenjaminRH> but I'm not quite sure what to do to fix this
[16:13:20] <BenjaminRH> I've taken a look at .delay(), but it doesn't seem to me that stopping for an arbitrary amount of time could be the right answer
[16:13:32] <seich> BenjaminRH: yep, that's the problem. Try this: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded and listen for loaded events and then fade it in
[16:13:48] <seich> BenjaminRH: when it triggers
[16:13:51] <Trudko_> seich: yes
[16:14:11] <BenjaminRH> Brilliant
[16:14:23] <BenjaminRH> That should work perfectly
[16:14:25] <seich> Trudko_: x) oh, I see the arrows now, hmm
[16:14:26] <BenjaminRH> thanks very much!
[16:14:41] <seich> BenjaminRH: you're welcome :)
[16:15:46] <Trudko_> btw seriously last thing have you worked with json?
[16:16:40] <seich> Trudko_: yep, most of the servers here only know how to throw json at you
[16:16:59] <seich> Trudko_: since we manage most of the rendering and that kind of stuff on the clientside
[16:16:59] <TylerWhitney> anybody here know of or use the jquery plugin "chosen" by Harvest?
[16:18:23] <Trudko_> seich: i am asking because last part of assignem stated: there is a lot of repeated stuff in html, create json from which this html could be generated. this does not really make sense to me i mean i get json but unless you know template engine rules you really are just guessing the json structure
[16:19:27] <seich> Trudko_: I guess they just want you to create an arbitraty json that contains all of the information you'd need to generate the html dynamically on the clientside ( I spelled dynamically wrong? didn't I?)
[16:20:05] <BenjaminRH> spelled correctly :)
[16:20:10] <Trudko_> heh nope you did not ;0
[16:20:33] <seich> Yay! :D
[16:20:40] <seich> it seemed wrong for some reason
[16:20:56] <Trudko_> seich: and yes I guess coiurious what would i add to that json all the divs? or only yhose with same class
[16:21:49] <seich> Trudko_: I'd just return the url to the image, and it's thumbnail so it'd end up being some sort of object arrays of images and thumbnails
[16:22:02] <seich> Trudko_: I don't think that made sense. let me show you
[16:24:28] <seich> Trudko_: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/seich/Shzkq/
[16:24:45] <seich> Trudko_: at least, I think, I'd be able to generate all of the html needed from that I guess
[16:25:31] <Trudko_> seich: how could you? you have info about images there only
[16:26:44] <seich> Trudko_: that's pretty much all you need, I'd iterate over all the objects and add the image to the original's container and the thumbnail to the thumbnail container as  I go through it
[16:27:45] <Trudko_> seich: why not to add also the divs those are also the same more or less
[16:27:55] <Trudko_> and give them attribute for children in this case images
[16:28:26] <seich> because json is better of only containing information, rather than structure
[16:28:33] <seich> that way you'd have more freedom
[16:29:49] <Trudko_> seich: what do you mean?
[16:30:06] <seich> Trudko_: you want to add the whole div to the json file, right?
[16:30:41] <Trudko_> seich: i would add only those with with class product item-
[16:31:38] <seich> well for each element in the object array, you can create a new div with jquery, add a class of product and item-i (where i is the index of the current object you're going through) and append it to the originals div
[16:31:51] <seich> and do the same for thumbnails
[16:32:19] <BenjaminRH> Alright, I'm to bed, it being 2:30 am.
[16:32:32] <BenjaminRH> seich: thanks for your help, it was appreciated
[16:32:37] <Trudko_> exactly images could be added dynamicaly
[16:33:21] <seich> Trudko_: yeah, that's why the only info you need is the image url so you can add those dynamically as well
[16:33:35] <Trudko_> seich: yeah thats true actually
[16:34:08] <Trudko_> because actually you know that one image is two divs in the end
[16:34:22] <seich> yep
[16:34:31] <seich> and you know what the classes should be called and all
[16:34:39] <seich> so you can add all of the information on the clientside
[16:34:47] <seich> and jquery makes this trivially easy
[16:35:59] <Trudko_> seich: yeap btw i am corious why did you youse one array with thre objects rather then having  one object and each image could be attribute - another object with  two params
[16:36:34] <seich> because, this way feels more self-contained
[16:36:38] <seich> it could be done either way I guess
[16:36:40] <Trudko_> √†lso double quotes are not needed for attributes are they?
[16:37:00] <seich> but I see them as images, and thus, I need a list with all the images I want
[16:37:08] <seich> and no, as far as I know they are not required
[16:37:22] <seich> but more often than not I crash into class which you can't use without quotes
[16:37:34] <Trudko_> ok can you just check the arrows I and will leave you alone and I will go ,,abuse"the bved
[16:37:35] <Trudko_> bed
[16:37:40] <seich> so I just add them most of the time to make sure I don't run into that problem
[16:37:50] <seich> oh, yeah I forgot about those xD\
[16:37:55] <seich> sorry xD
[16:38:28] <seich> can you give me the link again? :( I might have lost it x)
[16:44:29] <Trudko_> seich: http://jsfiddle.net/p6S2m/24/
[16:44:42] <john_c> Hello! I'd like to know if it's possible to call all the handlers for an event, then get the final event object?
[16:45:09] <john_c> For instance to call isDefaultPrevented() on it
[16:50:39] <john_c> I'm trying to use jQuery to links while some analytics are sent. The problem is, some of them have been wired up to use AJAX.
[16:51:20] <john_c> sry, I meant: I'm trying to use jQuery to postpone links while some analytics are sent. The problem is, some of them have been wired up to use AJAX.
[16:52:13] <rns> anyone know how I can use the formatted numbers to submit the actual number (not the formatted representation) via a form? http://www.bendewey.com/code/formatcurrency/demo/
[16:52:16] <seich> john_c: you could wait for the ajax callback and then use window.location to change the position
[16:52:32] <Emn1ty> is there any reason why a fancybox call would not work on elements added to the page (as a string)?
[16:52:36] <seich> john_c: I mean the page, to redirect
[16:55:01] <john_c> @seich, my thoughts exactly. But, after the analytics data has been posted, I need to determine whether someone's attached a handler using jQuery which might have called preventDefault(). If so, then I don't want to change window.location.
[16:55:26] <john_c> The bit I can't figure out is how to call all the handlers, and find out if one of them called preventDefault().
[16:56:24] <mikepj> john_c: http://api.jquery.com/event.isDefaultPrevented/
[16:56:40] <seich> Trudko_: http://jsfiddle.net/seich/p6S2m/26/ check it out, all you need now is to make them look pretty and to add a hover effect
[16:57:13] <john_c> Yes, but how do I call all possible handlers in such a way that I get the final event?
[16:57:34] <Trudko_> seich: why didnt you put them under the main image not sure if i was clear
[16:57:47] <Trudko_> normaly you have arrows under  large image and right arrow is on right side
[16:58:25] <seich> Trudko_: I am not sure I understand what you want :|
[16:58:48] <Trudko_> seich: you have main image the large one and arrow should be directly after that
[16:58:53] <Trudko_> under that
[16:59:22] <rns> is there a better way to do this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1764183/submit-unmasked-form-value-with-jquery-meiomask
[16:59:43] <rns> I'm formatting text input values as currency, but need them submitted as actual numbers
[17:00:24] <seich> john_c: yeah, that's what I was going to recommend, doesn't it do the trick?
[17:00:47] <seich> Trudko_: on top of the image?
[17:00:55] <Trudko_> or under
[17:00:59] <Trudko_> i think under it makes more sense
[17:02:52] <john_c> seich, mikepj: Firstly, I need to trigger all possible handlers, i.e. with .trigger(), but then I need to get the final event object, so I can use isDefaultPrevented() to determine if one of the handlers called preventDefault().
[17:03:41] <john_c> My question is, how do I trigger all of the handlers, then get the event object after all of the handlers have run?
[17:03:45] <seich> Trudko_: does this do it: http://jsfiddle.net/seich/p6S2m/27/?
[17:04:13] <Trudko_> seich:  lol yes ;)
[17:04:30] <seich> Trudko_: yay!
[17:04:42] <Trudko_> seich: thanks a lot for all the help
[17:04:55] <seich> Trudko_: you're welcome ;)
[17:05:35] <john_c> I'm back
[17:05:37] <seich> john_c: you could get all of the events
[17:05:42] <seich> and trigger them one by one?
[17:06:01] <seich> john_c: something like: $(elem).data('events')
[17:06:15] <john_c> I only care about one event
[17:06:23] <seich> john_c: which event?
[17:06:28] <john_c> The click event
[17:06:52] <john_c> I want to trigger all the handlers and get the event object they were all passed
[17:07:12] <seich> john_c, what handlers are you talking about?
[17:07:26] <seich> john_c: I thought you wanted event handlers
[17:07:31] <john_c> Let me write a jsFiddle
[17:08:20] <seich> ok, I've gotta leave the pc though, so, wait a little for me to get home before I can help you any further

[17:49:20] <mdhopkins> a query addClass is affecting the appearance of unrelated text in other elements, taking away their text shadow. The element affected depends on zoom level and it's always only one container (div). Any ideas what might be going on?
[17:49:34] <mdhopkins> a jquery*
[17:51:15] <mdhopkins> At minimum, if anyone can even suggest the words I should be Googling to read about this, I'd appreciate it.

[17:59:05] <coldhead> :D
[17:59:37] <coldhead> mdhopkins: that sounds really weird. do you have a demo?
[18:01:14] <mdhopkins> coldhead: here's a local tunnel: http://4rvh.localtunnel.com I've narrowed it to webkit only. At 100% zoom on the portfolio circles, watch the fixed position menu up top.
[18:01:52] <mdhopkins> I mean chrome type browser, not necessarily a webkit bug.
[18:02:27] <coldhead> i really get the feeling this is a browser bug
[18:02:32] <coldhead> i wonder how you even found it
[18:02:44] <mdhopkins> Testing my work! :)
[18:02:52] <coldhead> obsessive testing :)
[18:02:55] <mdhopkins> It's in Chromium, too, so not getting fixed anytime soon if so.
[18:03:09] <coldhead> mdhopkins: i would bravely enquire in ##chromium
[18:03:21] <coldhead> and get help to file a ticket if so directred
[18:03:27] <mdhopkins> *steels nerves* okay.
[18:03:29] <coldhead> or at least directed to an existing issue
[18:04:06] <coldhead> mdhopkins: if you can get a reduced test case to show paul_irish i bet you could interest him

[18:08:08] <Tales1> i have a question: is there a way to make a page load before closing the previous one with jquery? i want to animate a page so it doesn't look like it's opening an anchor
[18:08:22] <Tales1> that wa my question like 1 hour ago lol, no one answered
[18:09:10] <matteu> Tales1: jQuery mobile has AJAX loading functionality built-in.
[18:09:32] <beppu> Tales1: you might also want to google for: html5 pushstate
[18:09:55] <coldhead> Tales1: this used to do what you want http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-starwipe-plugin/
[18:10:00] <coldhead> but it doesn't work for me now
[18:10:15] <Tales1> let me check...
[18:10:15] <coldhead> beppu++, pushstate is the hot new way to do it, with a shim for older browsers
[18:14:13] <beppu> Tales1: go to https://github.com/balupton/history.js
[18:14:52] <Tales1> ok... the starwipe plugin might similar to what i'm looking for, but i'm not entirely sure
[18:15:45] <Tales1> i think i need to read the documentation because the examples ain't conclusive
[18:16:04] <rns> is there a better way to do this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1764183/submit-unmasked-form-value-with-jquery-meiomask

[18:19:19] <coldhead> you really can't just clean them up on the server?
[18:25:07] <Tales1> ok. I'm a little confused suppose I have page A and page B and I have a link in page A to call page B (<a href="./pages/page_b.php" id="page-b-link">My link</a> ) I would like to do something like: $( "#page-b-link" ).click( function(){ block UI, show a loading image, load page B, replace the entire HTML with the new HTML, unblock UI } );
[18:25:44] <gataraid> I'm not exactly sure where I should ask this but I am trying to come up with a way to submit a form that's inside of a while loop (multiple forms if it has more then one product) using the wpec plugin and the cart_widget
[18:25:55] <gataraid> I know I am going to have to probably use jquery but it's a wordpress related question so I asn't sure if I should kinda throw my question here or there
[18:26:03] <gataraid> I mean should I assign a class to the form, and onclick event that would submit the form class ?
[18:28:23] <mdhopkins> Testing.
[18:29:50] <mdhopkins> I filed a webkit bug. Hopefully they fix it.
[18:32:57] <Tales1> I think starwipe is not working very good
[18:33:06] <coldhead> it used to :(
[18:33:07] <Tales1> any other way to do it?
[18:33:20] <coldhead> did you check beppu's github link above?
[18:33:33] <coldhead> good luck mdhopkins
[18:33:41] <Tales1> yeah, but i think it is either too advanced for me or not what i need
[18:34:24] <Tales1> i can understand jquery code most of the time, but i hardly understand the DOM
[18:34:37] <coldhead> Tales1: http://www.seomoz.org/blog/create-crawlable-link-friendly-ajax-websites-using-pushstate
[18:34:47] <coldhead> that seems a thorough tutorial
[18:34:56] <coldhead> if nothing else it will give you more keywords to google
[18:38:56] <thewebs> I has a question regarding sortable which I have posted in detail here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12398198/jquery-sortable, I am wondering if some one can help me
[18:39:29] <coldhead> i can't help thewebs but props for your means of asking
[18:39:40] <thewebs> thanks?
[18:40:52] <thewebs> is there any one here who can point me in the right direction?
[18:40:54] <Lucky--> Why am i getting the dom element itself vs teh value here? http://jsfiddle.net/6Rc9A/
[18:45:53] <thewebs> any one have anythoughts as too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12398198/jquery-sortable
[18:46:21] <Jagst3r15> could anyone point me in some direction, im trying to use jQuery to figure out the height of the next slide and transition the container height as it comes in...http://jagst3r15.com
[18:46:39] <Jagst3r15> see purple mountain slide and how the slide nav elements get freaky
[18:47:22] <tw2113> Lucky--, is this the spot making the [object] stuff show up in the inputs? ko.applyBindings(vm);
[18:47:42] <Lucky--> tw2113: yea, im just wonderign why its the object and not the value
[18:47:51] <Lucky--> does the mapping plugin auto apply the bindings?
[18:47:51] <tw2113> try vm.html()
[18:48:02] <tw2113> maybe
[18:48:17] <Lucky--> no method html
[18:48:34] <tw2113> hmm
[18:48:36] <tw2113> was worth a shot
[18:49:42] <Tales1> hmmm, coldhead, looks like that is in the worst case, the best approach to my problem so far
[18:50:14] <coldhead> it's the same approach as starwipe, it just explains it better
[18:52:04] <coldhead> Jagst3r15: this is maybe a case for rendering/show()ing the next slide "offscreen" with margin-left:-999999em or similar, then retrieving the height from there
[18:52:28] <Jagst3r15>  not following
[18:54:01] <coldhead> ah well, it was worth a shot
[18:54:11] <ML74> Has anyone used Google Charts and loaded them with AJAX? I'm having some trouble getting it to load. Getting the following error in the console: "Uncaught ReferenceError: google is not defined"
[18:56:34] <Jagst3r15> coldhead thanks for attempting though, I am kinda noob so not your fault
[19:04:04] <enrique> hi, guys mi code threw a exception with the message TypeError: ((jQuery.event.special[handleObj.origType] || {}).handle || handleObj.handler).apply is not a function in http://localhost:3000/assets/jquery.js?body=1 (line 3333)
[19:04:22] <enrique> I, am using the jquery 1.7.2
[19:09:45] <ML74> Could anyone lend a hand to help me with Google Charts? Trying to load one using AJAX. Have a look at http://glistrr.com/system/tablet/admin/   Click the Analytics nav item and you'll see the problem.
[19:14:46] <gataraid> If there is a loop that called multiple forms to go with a product type, for a shopping cart widget... is it possible to submit the form so it updates from one button ?
[19:15:40] <gataraid> I tried assigning a class to the form and using click to submit the class
[19:15:44] <gataraid> but it didn't seem to work
[19:16:12] <thewebs> any one have anythoughts as too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12398198/jquery-sortable
[19:41:11] <brian__> can anyone see anything wrong with this snippet: http://pastebin.com/x3hWYFjG (getting unexpected token illegal)
[19:42:05] <coldhead> did you try jshint, brian__?
[19:42:26] <ibodi> if (a==b){ aler('yes'); }  || if(a==b) alert('yes') || which style you prefer ?
[19:42:36] <brian__> sorry cold head, not sure what jshint is
[19:42:54] <ibodi> when there is only one line of code, do we need {} ?
[19:43:05] <coldhead> jshint is a linter
[19:43:09] <coldhead> ?jshint
[19:43:09] <bot-t> http://jshint.com/
[19:43:13] <brian__> looking at it now
[19:43:18] <brian__> pretty cool
[19:43:19] <brian__> thanks!
[19:44:22] <coldhead> also, brian__, why [id=whatever] when you could do #whatever
[19:45:08] <brian__> not sure, that's what I saw in an example
[19:45:16] <brian__> #thumb_selection img:visible
[19:45:18] <brian__> seems shorter to me :)
[19:45:21] <brian__> I'll use that, thanks
[19:45:53] <coldhead> shorter AND faster
[19:45:56] <coldhead> and idiomatic
[19:46:39] <coldhead> bye, gav
[19:46:42] <brian__> I changed it to: var image = $('#thumb_selection img:visible');‚Äã
[19:46:53] <brian__> and all jshint.com shows is: Unexpected '‚Äã'.
[19:49:19] <brian__> if it helps, I'm trying to basically just detect which image is currently being displayed in a carousel.
[19:50:53] <coldhead> you must have some weird character in your selector, brian__
[19:50:58] <coldhead> did you copy and paste it?
[19:51:05] <coldhead> when i retyped it it worked fine
[19:51:09] <brian__> hmm weird
[19:51:15] <brian__> let me try retyping it
[19:51:29] <coldhead> peraps some weird invisible unicode
[19:53:43] <brian__> weird retyped it and get the same thing
[19:53:45] <brian__> strange one
[19:55:05] <brian__> got it
[19:55:28] <brian__> you were right, it was a unicode character just after the semi-colon
[19:55:29] <brian__> thanks man!
[19:56:04] <coldhead> the take home message is hooray for jshint
[19:56:08] <coldhead> good luck brian__
[19:56:34] <brian__> yeah jshint is pretty awesome. definitely will be using that in the future.
[20:03:16] <ibodi> are they same or same to use: var md5=function(str){...} || function md5(str){...} ?
[20:06:17] <ibodi> coldhead: too easy to answer?
[20:10:32] <mfoxdogg|work> afternoon all
[20:15:43] <jnm> lo, it's 5am bro
[20:46:54] <coldhead> bot-t: tell ibodi http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/
[20:46:55] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[20:46:59] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[20:46:59] * bot-t sighs
[20:48:28] <coldhead> sup gav
[21:13:15] <Gavilan2> Any idea of a method to deep copy a cyclic objects? I tried jquery.extend but it doesn't handle that case...
[21:13:41] <pd_slv> anybody else unable to access an element you have just inserted with .load() ?
[21:16:00] <coldhead> you maybe want to use the load() callback?
[21:16:05] <coldhead> load is asynchronous
[21:16:31] <coldhead> so .load(); do_a_thing(); won't work as well as .load(..., do_a_thing)
[21:19:54] <pd_slv> thanks coldhead
[21:20:05] <pd_slv> I was wondering that myself
[21:24:25] <uSMS> hey guys, i have been using draggable, and loading new elements with ajax, but when they are loaded they're not draggable.
[21:24:40] <uSMS> is there some way that newly loaded ajax content can be draggable too?
[21:24:50] <uSMS> with .live() or .on() maybe?
[21:26:12] <coldhead> no
[21:26:22] <coldhead> you have to run draggable() on the new content as your load it
[21:26:25] <coldhead> you*
[21:26:41] <coldhead> ajax has callbacks to let you do such things easily
[21:27:02] <uSMS> oh cool. that does make sense. let me try it
[21:34:39] <pd_slv> coldhead, you're a genius
[21:34:51] <pd_slv> or at the very least, you helped me heaps, so thanks!
[21:34:53] <uSMS> coldhead: thanks! works now :)
[21:34:59] <coldhead> good work everyone, take five
[21:35:12] <pd_slv> heaps of good karma for coldhead!
[21:44:15] <sasori> hey i have a the value of this $(this).children('img').attr('alt'); during a click function, now i want to assign that to a php variable..how to do that?
[22:14:13] <Already> Good Morning/Night whatever your timezone tells you! I got an array of values which need to be processed by getJSON (if possible in parallel) is there a way to combine this with $.when ? So get the chance to notice whenever every request is finished?
[22:15:03] <coldhead> try this tutorial, Already http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/wrangle-async-tasks-with-jquery-promises/
[22:17:03] <Already> Thanks coldhead i'll have a look
[22:52:36] <coldhead> long slow day is long, slow
[22:53:30] <Already> I guess that'S why it's a long, slow day. ;) Still it's only 8 AM here ... so there my day hasn't really been that long.
[22:54:50] <coldhead> give it time :)
[22:55:11] <coldhead> i've been  here for 65 years aat least and it's not even 4pm
[23:09:17] <Already> That tutorial was really worth reading. Though I think i didn't fully understand it. $.when is a kind of "fire as soon as one request files or if every request finishes". Would i have to use $.pipe in order to get a "fire if everything is finished, regardless of sate"?
[23:17:09] <Cork> Already: no when is called when all deffered objects has been resolved
[23:17:15] <Cork> not when just one of them has been
[23:18:47] <Cork> and depending on what function you attach to when you can get done/fail/always
[23:18:56] <Cork> *then you can
[23:20:14] <Already> If they are successfully resolved that's true. But $.when().fail() fires as soon as one of them is rejected and .done is never called.
[23:21:34] <Already> I might use .progress to count the number of elements which have been processed but i thought there might be a "ready to go" function for this.
[23:32:19] <Cork> Already: from what it looks like, that might actually be a bug, not sure though
[23:34:11] <coldhead> lol irccloud
[23:51:59] <anli_> Are controllers and views connected with each other via name?
[23:52:28] <Cork> anli_: your sure you asked that in the correct channel?
[23:53:40] <anli_> doh!
[23:53:46] <anli_> Cork: sorry
[23:54:19] <Cork> heh no prob, i think i know what your talking about, but it doens't really make sense in the context of jquery :)
[23:54:53] <Already> My solution has been to create an array of deferreds which are resolved on .progress of the getJSON and then are passed to a .when using .apply. I came up with it after reading http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5824615 and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5627284
[23:56:25] <Already> Oh not .progress, i bound the same function to .done and .fail ... for some reason .progress didn't work for getJSON.
