[00:00:45] <codeAssassin> o]: moment
[00:01:48] <lsterling03> So here's the code I have now that works when you're clicking around within the page - http://jsfiddle.net/YfasE/34/ But coming from the homepage or another page.... that's where I can't get the active class to apply.
[00:02:45] <paul_irish> });  ==>    }).click();
[00:02:46] <Whirl3d__> lsterling03, don't you want all the links that refer to your sections to be active when one is clicked?   In other words, if you have 3 links that link to one section, don't you want them all to show active? or just the ones in the menu items?
[00:02:47] <paul_irish> maybe
[00:02:52] <paul_irish> im hardly listening
[00:02:53] <Lucky--> staring at javascript while on xanax is no easy task my friends.
[00:03:07] <imsky> lsterling03, i got it buddy
[00:03:13] <paul_irish> nevermind that is a terrible idea
[00:03:15] <paul_irish> ignoreme
[00:04:13] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/YfasE/35/
[00:04:17] <o]> codeAssassin: I think I have to set the position too
[00:04:31] <codeAssassin> o]: yes
[00:04:37] <lsterling03> So you've got the About Us page, and three jumplinks in the sidebar to "mission" and "history" and "leaders".... I want only "leaders" to be highlighted when you're on that anchor, and so on....
[00:05:26] <lsterling03> ok lemme try that
[00:05:35] <codeAssassin> o]: http://jsfiddle.net/LgKdQ/
[00:06:24] <imsky> lsterling03, http://jsfiddle.net/imsky/txDZe/
[00:06:26] <Whirl3d__> the thing is that if you have an anchor that has buttons in both the menu wrapper and the main_menu only the clicked one will show active
[00:06:40] <codeAssassin> o]: the z-index is to make sure it floats on top of other elements should something already have an index
[00:06:52] <codeAssassin> o]: it determines the level of stacking
[00:07:01] <imsky> lsterling03, copy that html and css and test, you'll see it works on load as well
[00:07:11] <o]> codeAssassin: worked algo w/o z-index
[00:07:17] <o]> codeAssassin: worked alSo w/o z-index
[00:07:18] <Whirl3d__> you didn't say we could rewrite your entire navigation. LOL
[00:07:41] <codeAssassin> o]: it should in most cases
[00:09:36] <lsterling03> thanks imsky... trying now.
[00:09:55] <lsterling03> (and no whirl3d - I still have to use the same nav haha)
[00:10:32] <Whirl3d__> the way imsky implements it, you are binding the hashchange event so navigate
[00:10:43] <o]> codeAssassin: thanks. it is mostly working, but something on my append is funky
[00:10:43] <Whirl3d__> my preferred way to do it as well, but
[00:10:51] <o]> new image is showing at the end of the document
[00:11:01] <o]> newImg.css("position","absolute"); -- is that correct?
[00:11:05] <o]> newImg.appendTo('body');
[00:11:14] <codeAssassin> o]: lol ok. look at the append i did. maybe it helps
[00:11:25] <codeAssassin> o]: you should give it a class, that has position absolute
[00:11:42] <o]> setting the css by hand won't work?
[00:11:51] <codeAssassin> o]: will work, bad practice
[00:12:36] <fRAiLtY-> Why does this not select a column, click "Price Matrix" at the bottom. When you select drop-down 1 it should highlight that column. Drop-down 2 successfully highlights a row? http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[00:12:49] <codeAssassin> o]: keep as much css as you can in css files. don't rely on inline styles or settings css styles via jquery
[00:12:51] <o]> ok. I see, but it is still showing the image some blocks away
[00:13:05] <o]> is position() the correct function to get a position of an element?
[00:13:27] <codeAssassin> o]: why would you want to get the position?
[00:13:45] <codeAssassin> o]: it's floating on your body right? then you should use left and top values to set it's position
[00:13:58] <o]> yes, but I need to get the position of an existing img first
[00:14:11] <o]> and place my new img according to that position
[00:14:52] <codeAssassin> o]: yes you can use position to get the left and top values
[00:14:57] <lsterling03> imsky, does this totally replace the code I had before? Or in addition to?
[00:15:09] <imsky> lsterling03, totally. i didn't even look at what you had before
[00:15:19] <imsky> just wrote from the haart
[00:16:35] <o]> newImg.css("position","absolute"); newImg.css("left",position.left); newImg.css("right",position.right);
[00:16:39] <o]> LOL
[00:17:05] <o]> I am really stupid :D
[00:17:10] <o]> thanks for your help
[00:17:14] <codeAssassin> o]: lol
[00:17:16] <codeAssassin> o]: gl
[00:17:21] <ZOHAIB> HI
[00:17:31] <imsky> it's zohaib
[00:17:36] <ZOHAIB> YA
[00:19:28] <lsterling03> sadly it's not working once I put in my own navigation..... even the within the page links are no longer working, which were before. i'm out of my depth here, i think.
[00:19:43] <imsky> pshaw
[00:19:50] <imsky> show me the modified source
[00:19:54] <imsky> and i'll show you the future
[00:21:20] <Whirl3d__> lsterling03, why don't you just post the damned source? instead of playing cat and mouse like this?
[00:26:01] <imsky> you scared him off
[00:30:11] <Whirl3d__> how many hours of back and forth when you know damned well it's gonna be a missed, ' or ; or something.
[00:30:13] <lsterling03> sorry whirl3d... i can't find where to PM... and I didn't want to post the  URL
[00:30:26] <fRAiLtY-> GRR!! Ok, here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing on the Price Matrix tab, you can see that if you select box 1 or box 2 (above it - the drop-downs) it moves the highlighter on the table to what you've selected, BUT it doesn't highlight the column. This code is COPIED AND PASTED from here: http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/46/ Where it works??? Why!? Before I smash it.
[00:30:29] <Whirl3d__> why not.
[00:30:42] <Whirl3d__> what client are you using?
[00:31:08] <lsterling03> I guess I feel like I should post my clients site publically
[00:31:12] <lsterling03> shouldn't
[00:31:15] <lsterling03> how do I PM?
[00:31:32] <Whirl3d__> I thought you said it was your blog....lol that's why I was confused.
[00:32:18] <lsterling03> here's the jfiddle....http://jsfiddle.net/txDZe/2/ with my new stuff in it.
[00:33:17] <Whirl3d__> lsterling...what irc client are you using?
[00:34:27] <lsterling03> freenode
[00:34:36] <imsky> lsterling03, your inner UL is not inside an LI, it's between the two LIs
[00:34:46] <Whirl3d__> thats the server
[00:34:52] <imsky> lsterling03, http://jsfiddle.net/imsky/txDZe/3/
[00:34:56] <Whirl3d__> or rather the network
[00:35:04] <Whirl3d__> are you using a web client?
[00:36:29] <imsky> ?g american idol 2013
[00:36:29] <caniuse> imsky: American Idol Auditions 2013: Season 12 Tryouts Dates, Cities - http://manila-paper.net/american-idol-auditions-2013-season-12-tryouts-schedule-dates-cities/34639
[00:36:35] <imsky> interesting
[00:36:47] <imsky> so where's bot-t
[00:37:29] <lsterling03> whirl - I'm using firefox... I just clicked a link from the jquery forum website to
[00:37:45] <Whirl3d__> gotcha...
[00:40:02] <Whirl3d__> I can't find the link in jquery forums to try out the client they are using. LOL

[00:41:01] <shoky> i think /msg nick msg
[00:41:06] <shoky> works on all clients ;p
[00:42:04] <imsky> you guys will figure it out
[00:42:39] <lsterling03> argh. still can't get it to work... maybe it has something to do with the shitty theme I inherited, which is so loaded down with other scripts.

[00:52:27] <morra> hi everyone
[00:53:15] <morra> does anyone try to get search result from chrome web store using javascript?
[00:55:00] <Dr-Bombay> !ask
[00:55:41] <morra> no ask?
[00:55:58] <Dr-Bombay> don't ask "has anyone" "is anyone", "does anyone" etc
[00:57:23] <morra> sry , first time here
[00:57:38] <morra> i was wondering
[00:58:43] <morra> if i want to do things like "write a html file and run it on brower to get chrome store search list"
[00:58:58] <morra> is jsonp what i really need?
[01:01:03] <Nece228> hello
[01:01:05] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/x7TpR/8/
[01:01:06] <Nece228> this is my problem
[01:01:12] <Nece228> the code works only on first row
[01:01:20] <Nece228> how to make it work on second row too?
[01:04:28] <Nece228> the html rows are output of a loop
[01:09:11] <morra> maybe other jquery selectors do help
[01:09:19] <optimusza1> The problem you have is using the selectors on the id. when you search for $('#first') it always finds the first one and same with the result input
[01:10:11] <optimusza1> http://jsfiddle.net/x7TpR/10/
[01:10:19] <optimusza1> take another look. I have changed it slightly for you
[01:10:26] <optimusza1> so you are now searching within the table row
[01:11:10] <runvnc> I think you need to use class= instead of id=
[01:11:26] <optimusza1> you can use id or class. take a look at the new fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/x7TpR/10/
[01:13:39] <Nece228> ah thanks
[01:13:42] <Nece228> let me try
[01:15:25] <loke> Hi, I'm wondering if there's a built-in jquery function that remaps the value according to a new range ... something like map(value, range1start, range1end, range2start, range2end);
[01:16:02] <raj> ( V ) shoky?
[01:17:19] <Xotix> hi
[01:17:42] <optimusza1> hello
[01:18:12] <shoky> is that your ass, raj
[01:18:24] <raj> yes
[01:18:28] <raj> thought we established that
[01:18:29] * shoky smacks
[01:18:38] <lokeeee> Hi, I'm wondering if there's a built-in jquery function that remaps the value according to a new range ... something like map(value, range1start, range1end, range2start, range2end);
[01:19:14] <raj> k, gonna pm shoky
[01:19:30] <shoky> lokeeee no. tho not 100% sure what you mean
[01:20:39] <Whirl3d__> iokeee, there is a jquery.map function though
[01:20:40] <lokeeee> shoky: so just a quick example: map(1, 1,10, 10, 100); => this would return 10 (as 10 is the same in the 10 - 100 range as 1 is in the 1 - 10 range) ... map(valueForRange1, range1start, range1end, range2start, range2end);
[01:20:59] <lokeeee> yeah, not what I need ... I am just referring to it as map because it's called like that in some other languages
[01:21:09] <Xotix> I'm using .text() to clean up pasted stuff. The problem is, it also deletes breaks. Why? How to prevent?
[01:22:48] <Whirl3d__> iokeee, I still have no idea what you are trying to accomplish. What does this have to do with dom selection?
[01:26:24] <Whirl3d__> iokee, what other languages? I can't seem to find any reference to that method signature
[01:27:37] <Eshu> Nece228: you there
[01:28:07] <Eshu> Nece228: use live event
[01:28:28] <Whirl3d__> Don't use live event.
[01:28:44] <zamba> what's live event?
[01:28:55] <Whirl3d__> use the .on handler like we've gone over a couple dozen times with you already...
[01:28:59] <zamba> it's deprecated!
[01:29:23] <Whirl3d__> use .on
[01:30:07] <Whirl3d__> Xotix, do you have a fiddle? Where are you getting the pastedtext?
[01:31:09] <Xotix> Whirl3d a fiddle, yeah will create one in 5minutes. :)
[01:31:52] <Whirl3d__> nece228, are you for real? You can't have two elements iwth the same id
[01:32:47] <lokeeee> Whirl3d__: I wrote it myself now :-) ... http://pastebin.com/ZTUNhGU0
[01:32:54] <shoky> uhh
[01:32:58] <shoky> lokeeee: function map(i,a,b,c,d) { return (i - a) * (d-c) / (b-a) + c }
[01:33:00] <shoky> o
[01:33:16] <lokeeee> shoky: lol!
[01:33:25] <lokeeee> yours is shorter though :D
[01:33:29] <shoky> ;P
[01:33:47] <shoky> it's just math. jquery doesnt do much of that ;p
[01:34:16] <lokeeee> well ... some languages have built-in support for it, figured I should ask before reinventing the wheel once more
[01:34:36] <granden> Is it possible to remove all classes from a div?
[01:34:51] <lokeeee> granden: remove the class attribute :)
[01:34:53] <granden> Like removeClass() but where I dont hove to specify any, or rather, could I remove any class except a certain one?
[01:35:20] <granden> lokeeee: So remove the class attribute and then append the new class would be the best solution then?
[01:37:17] <lokeeee> granden: you could do it that way yes, as long as you know what class you're going to add back, it wont cause problems
[01:38:15] <shoky> granden:  $('#mydiv')[0].className = 'myclass'
[01:38:57] <granden> shoky: Hmm, ok, that would remove all others?
[01:39:10] <granden> A question though, why the [0]?
[01:39:20] <Whirl3d__> nece228, here ya go: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/x7TpR/14/
[01:39:28] <shoky> granden: yeah it'd be like setting the class attribute
[01:39:34] <lokeeee> granden: that grabs the actual DOM element instead of the jquery object
[01:39:36] <shoky> granden: to get access to the actual DOM element
[01:39:41] <granden> ah
[01:39:45] <granden> Ok, thanks a lot!
[01:40:00] <shoky> i guess also $('#mydiv').attr('class','myclass') is fine too
[01:40:32] <shoky> oh
[01:40:49] <shoky> granden: $('#mydiv').removeClass();   ;P
[01:40:56] <shoky> oops. nm
[01:41:53] <Whirl3d__> $("#mydiv").attr("class","singleClass");
[01:42:08] <Whirl3d__> or $("#mydiv").attr("class","");
[01:42:51] <Whirl3d__> maybe it should be prop in stead of attr...not sure though
[01:43:10] <Koganei> hola
[01:43:20] <Whirl3d__> hey there
[01:43:22] <xec> ?removeAttr @ granden
[01:43:23] <bot-t> granden, .removeAttr(attributeName): Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[01:43:43] <Koganei> how goes, Whirl3d__
[01:43:50] <xec> check out the note about IE
[01:44:07] <Whirl3d__> do you really wanna remove attr('class'). rather than just set its value to ""?
[01:44:08] <xec> looks like .prop() is the way to go
[01:44:18] <Whirl3d__> i was afraid fo that.
[01:44:28] <fr00d> Hello
[01:44:30] <Whirl3d__> good Koganei, what's new?
[01:45:12] <xec> for consistency, the note is only about inline handlers
[01:45:22] <fr00d> I'm trying to easily get a simple form to work with jquery.mobile. Can somebody tell me how this button thingy should work or point me to a documentation?
[01:45:27] <Koganei> not much, I'm trying to figure out how you would do something like move a div from one container to another, but visibly, like see it moving
[01:45:49] <Whirl3d__> use animate
[01:46:03] <hlve> Is there any way to take this: http://jsfiddle.net/uS9RZ/
[01:46:22] <Whirl3d__> I am not sure if I can take it...
[01:46:25] <Whirl3d__> lol
[01:46:25] <hlve> and make it so that my $(this).next('br').remove(); only fires off if there's an IMG following the BR tag?
[01:46:33] <Koganei> Whirl3d__: but the animate doesn't do the appending of the div to the new container
[01:46:37] <xec> take it, Whirl3d__!
[01:46:37] <youngin_> Can anybody do a complete rewrite of http://www.professorcloud.com/js/cloud-zoom.1.0.2.js for $100? I want it simpler, more beautiful, more object oriented - a la "perfection is achieved, not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to take away."
[01:47:00] <fr00d> What I wrote in my html code and what I get is: http://pastebin.com/7fbNdnMb
[01:47:05] <Koganei> like, do I have to calculate where it's gonna go? or can I just tell it to animate to wherever append() puts it
[01:47:09] <xec> hlve: .remove("img")
[01:47:13] <Whirl3d__> xec_ it's sooo big!
[01:47:14] <hlve> xec, no.
[01:47:15] <hlve> lol
[01:47:28] <xec> hlve: then what do you mean
[01:47:37] <hlve> Looking at the jsfiddle?
[01:47:43] <xec> oh i see, you're removing the br?
[01:48:04] <hlve> yeah, but I want to make it so that it only removes the BR if the BR has an IMG after it
[01:48:13] <hlve> It's kinda hacky, but I'm writing a greasemonkey script lol
[01:48:47] <Whirl3d__> $("br>img").closest("br").remove();
[01:49:01] <Whirl3d__> no sure about the >
[01:49:04] <Koganei> can you do that? br has no descendants
[01:49:05] <xec> Whirl3d__: images that are children of breaks? :)
[01:49:14] <xec> Koganei: nope :)
[01:49:15] <hlve> Noops ;/
[01:49:25] <Whirl3d__> wasn't sure it that was descendents or next
[01:49:27] <Koganei> does siblings() show the order?
[01:49:28] <hlve> Whirl3d__, that does this: http://jsfiddle.net/uS9RZ/2/
[01:49:31] <hlve> lol
[01:49:39] <Koganei> maybe you can get to see if br has an img sibling
[01:49:44] <xec> maybe $("br + img").prev().remove()
[01:49:45] <granden> Thanks a lot everyone, been really helpfull!
[01:49:57] <Nece228> optimusza1: thanks its working nicely in my code
[01:50:03] <hlve> Xec, same thing :/
[01:50:04] <Nece228> yay :D
[01:50:09] <granden> Got another question though, is it possibly to animate a fade in using visibility?
[01:50:11] <xec> hlve: same thing what
[01:50:27] <granden> like visibility:hidden; to visibility:display;?
[01:50:35] <hlve> it's not removing the BR after the image ;[
[01:50:44] <hlve> hmm.
[01:50:52] <xec> hlve: well you still have a link, so you dont have a br after an img :D
[01:51:06] <xec> god this is a mess
[01:51:07] <xec> :D
[01:51:15] <hlve> Ah, I worded it wrong me thinks
[01:51:15] <hlve> lol
[01:51:15] <Whirl3d__> $(br).each(function () {if ($(this).next() typeof "image") $(this).remove());})
[01:51:22] <xec> what *exactly* is this script doing
[01:51:47] <xec> Whirl3d__: rofl what
[01:51:58] <Whirl3d__> lol
[01:52:04] <hlve> xec, I'm writing a greasemonkey script for a gaming forum, basically just adding in some features, styling it, and all that jazz.
[01:52:05] <Koganei> oh, it's the other way around, right? the br comes after the image
[01:52:18] <xec> Koganei: no the image is inside the <a> :D
[01:52:35] <Koganei> looking at the fiddle now and it's not
[01:52:44] <hlve> for example, I'm taking this: http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/6/16919392963-orig.png
[01:53:04] <hlve> and creating this: http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/6/16919394886-orig.png
[01:53:08] <xec> Koganei: well he's looping through the <a>s with .media-preview each, right?
[01:53:17] <xec> Koganei: and then setting its .html() to an img tag
[01:53:18] <hlve> it's been a project that I've been working on for awhile now, and just wanted to wrap it up ;P
[01:53:27] <Koganei> and the br follows the a tag
[01:53:32] <xec> Koganei: yes
[01:53:40] <Koganei> so.. the br is not wrapped in the a tag
[01:53:45] <xec> no, the image is
[01:53:49] <hlve> no no, the BR is outside the A tag.
[01:54:04] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/uS9RZ/1/
[01:54:06] <Whirl3d__> lolol
[01:54:08] <hlve> That's my original fiddle.
[01:54:12] <Whirl3d__> who came first?
[01:54:22] <Koganei> :)
[01:54:23] <xec> the chicken!!
[01:54:26] <hlve> The egg.
[01:54:28] <Koganei> what's on second
[01:54:31] <xec> wrong!!
[01:54:39] <xec> lol
[01:54:42] <hlve> The creator of the chicken came first, ta-da.
[01:54:48] <xec> clever.
[01:55:17] <Koganei> anyways, so it's <img> <br>
[01:55:18] <Whirl3d__> we know its the egg cause chickens like all animals are glorified fish
[01:55:22] <Koganei> yes?
[01:55:23] <Whirl3d__> and fish lay egs
[01:55:28] <Whirl3d__> jeesh
[01:55:32] <xec> Koganei: no its <a><img></a><br>
[01:55:34] <Koganei> you're a glorified fish
[01:55:39] <hlve> Xec, right.
[01:55:42] <Koganei> xec: right
[01:56:11] <hlve> the entire reason I'm trying to do this is that my BR's are getting removed after plain text, so it's breaking formatting lol
[01:57:00] <Whirl3d__> so you want to remove any breaks that have <a><img/></a>  after them
[01:57:05] <hlve> Ye
[01:57:09] <Koganei> before them
[01:57:11] <Koganei> :o
[01:57:12] <Whirl3d__> piece of cake
[01:57:17] <Koganei> right?
[01:57:20] <optimusza1> what don't you rather use regex to remove formatting?
[01:57:30] <xec> hlve: well your loop is already going through all the media-preview tags, so the script is already doing what you're specifying
[01:57:33] <hlve> not sure if greasemonkey toys well with regex lol
[01:57:51] <Whirl3d__> $("br").each(function () {if$(this).next("a.mediaPreview").find("img").length) $(this).remove());
[01:58:10] <Whirl3d__> prolly some typos, but it should work
[01:58:17] <xec> Whirl3d__: work with the fiddle will you, then you'd see that it doesnt work
[01:58:39] <xec> or rather, that the original does work
[01:58:59] <xec> and that your loop there does basically nothing (even without typos)
[01:59:07] <hlve> one sec guys.
[01:59:16] <hlve> I'll show you EXACTLY what's happening so we can brainstorm lol
[01:59:27] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/uS9RZ/3/
[01:59:55] <xec> Whirl3d__: you're removing the wrong break
[01:59:56] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/uS9RZ/5/
[02:00:45] <xec> uh, is this what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/uS9RZ/6/
[02:00:51] <Koganei> I'm off to bed. g'night all, good luck hlve
[02:00:53] <fRAiLtY-> Why does this work here http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/46/ but not here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing (click Price Matrix). The columns don't highlight but the rows do?
[02:00:53] <xec> or can you explain what you want? :D
[02:00:59] <xec> Koganei: good night mate
[02:01:03] <Whirl3d__> what the fuck is it supposed to look like?
[02:01:08] <Whirl3d__> gnite Koganei
[02:01:23] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/uS9RZ/5/ --> You see how on the first set of images (top row of images), the last one doesn't have an a img tag after it, but it's still removing the BR, therefore breaking the formatting?
[02:01:26] <hlve> lol
[02:02:02] <xec> hlve: so what is it supposed to look like?
[02:02:15] <Nece228> any way to restrict text inputs to only numerics? the inputs are dynamic html
[02:02:37] <xec> Nece228: what is dynamic html?
[02:02:45] <xec> Nece228: generated by js?
[02:02:53] <Whirl3d__> remove the br right before an img or not?
[02:03:04] <Nece228> xec: yes
[02:03:06] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/uS9RZ/7/
[02:03:25] <xec> Nece228: ok, in that case: the same way you would do it with a static html input :)
[02:03:25] <hlve> one sec, testing it
[02:03:41] <Nece228> xec: well ive tried few plugins and they dont work
[02:04:27] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/uS9RZ/8/
[02:04:28] <fr00d> There should be a $('#myFormID').submit function which gets called when I submit my form. The only problem is that my button does not submit the form. But it has type="submit". Can somebody tell me what else I can try. Or give me a really really simple example for a jquery form submit?
[02:04:34] <xec> Nece228: have you tried http://code.google.com/p/webforms2/ -- should let you do <input type="number">
[02:04:55] <hlve> maybe I shouldn't have stayed up all night lol
[02:05:04] <hlve> I'm probably making 0 sense :[
[02:05:22] <xec> hlve: thats not true, i estimate about 0.2 sense
[02:05:35] <Xotix> If i have an object which is liek a numeric array and i do $(obj).each() why is this still the whole object?
[02:07:00] <xec> Xotix: you mean $.each(obj, func) ?
[02:07:02] <Xotix> or asked  differnetly. How can i loop trhough the properties of an obj?
[02:07:10] <Xotix> xec yes
[02:08:31] <Xotix> xec ah got it thanks.
[02:08:52] <Whirl3d__> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/uS9RZ/12/
[02:08:54] <Whirl3d__> finally
[02:09:33] <Nece228> xec: well i dont think its the solution for me
[02:09:44] <Xotix> xec a different little question. How do i get the property name? E.g. in php i can do freach($array as $key => $val) the ni got the value and the key.
[02:09:54] <Whirl3d__> I log out the logic where it looks at each break, if the next sibling has an image, remove it. if not, leave it
[02:10:03] <xec> Nece228: ok, do it manually then, check each keypress and prevent non-number input?
[02:10:35] <Whirl3d__> hive, is that what you wanted?
[02:10:43] <Xotix> got it thanks
[02:10:48] <Nece228> xec: ok, but it would be cool like jquery would have prebuilt function for that
[02:11:03] <fRAiLtY-> Why does this work here http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/46/ but not here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing (click Price Matrix). The columns don't highlight but the rows do?
[02:13:41] <Whirl3d__> frailty, I think you missed a plugin...you almost got every plugin written for jquery...but there's one you might be ...no, no you got them all
[02:15:00] <Whirl3d__> I mean, seriously. I have no idea where to even being
[02:15:34] <Whirl3d__> which script handles the select events?
[02:16:37] <Nece228> xec: whoops, it looks like plugin works
[02:16:39] <Nece228> my foult
[02:18:11] <Whirl3d__> remind me to kick hive right between the eyes next time he logs in. Dammit. lol
[02:19:55] <hlve> lol
[02:19:58] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d__:  It's Magento, 99% of those are already included!
[02:20:00] <hlve> I'm still here, but don't kick me
[02:20:07] <Whirl3d__> lol
[02:20:19] <Whirl3d__> did you see my last link, I think I got it
[02:20:34] <hlve> Trying it right now :S
[02:20:36] <Whirl3d__> frailty, I know. I just have no idea where to look
[02:21:05] <Whirl3d__> fRAiLtY-, finally my tab-complete key is working again..
[02:21:37] <mazzachre> I have a form as a javascript variable (got it via var form = document.forms['myform'];) then I fill in some values in again in normal javascript (form.elements['myelement'].value = 'myvalue';) and now I want to post the form data via an ajax call... How can I serialize it? $(form).serialize() or should I manipulate the form using jquery all the way through?
[02:23:27] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[02:23:31] <fRAiLtY-> tab-complete?
[02:24:04] <Whirl3d__> fRAiLtY-, i was typing in people's names character by character, so your name was a bitch to type. LOL
[02:24:38] <fRAiLtY-> Ah :D
[02:25:07] <fRAiLtY-> Well, it's just jQuery, with that script (in the fiddle) doing the selects. The actual selects are prototype.js. The odd thing is it did work, but now doesn't.
[02:25:22] <fRAiLtY-> Surely jQuery should just detect the attribute id
[02:26:17] <hlve> Just isn't formatting right still, you got it pretty far though
[02:26:21] <hlve> thanks for the help man :}
[02:27:03] <Whirl3d__> hive, just show me what it is supposed to look like, . do the html manually and I'll get ya there
[02:27:59] <mazzachre> Can I serialize a form kept in a var via $(form).serialize() ?
[02:29:40] <SoulRaven> hello
[02:29:43] <SoulRaven> anybody?
[02:29:58] <SoulRaven> i have a strange problem with ajax, jquery dialog
[02:30:52] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d__:  Do you have any ideas then?
[02:31:35] <SoulRaven> i am populating a dialog with a html content, and on the last rows of the html content i append a jquery method, but when the ajax call is made, and the content renderd, the jquery method is executed first, even if is last in the html content
[02:32:06] <SoulRaven> this is my code, that is parsed uusing ajax: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1049768752
[02:32:46] <SoulRaven> and this is the code for init file: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1852473111
[02:34:11] <SoulRaven> the problem is that even if the init.js is executated first, before the html content is parsed and displayed by the ui dialog
[02:36:51] <hlve> lol, Whirl3d__: http://jsfiddle.net/uS9RZ/13/
[02:37:06] <hlve> If that helps depict what I'm trying to do, please let me know. If not, tell me to go away.
[02:37:14] <hlve> Lack of sleep makes me stupid ;/
[02:37:47] <SoulRaven> anyone has any ideea way is this strange behaivor?
[02:40:45] <hlve> it'd be easier to debug if we saw a working example :/
[02:41:03] <hlve> what's your ajax call look like?
[02:41:19] <hlve> Are you using .ready()?
[02:41:34] <SoulRaven> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1555235999
[02:42:12] <SoulRaven> no, because i dont need ready, i am just parsing a html content, i am not render a document with head and body
[02:42:48] <SoulRaven> i have bin the html content, init file and last is the ajax for calling the html content
[02:45:01] <aaronmcadam> anybody ever heard of a limit of around 10,000 characters on a text area?
[02:45:02] <hlve> Nothing coming up in error console? Cntrl+Shift+J in firefox/chrome.
[02:45:20] <aaronmcadam> text areas aren't limited are they?
[02:45:40] <SoulRaven> no, the console is clean, and if i want to query some elements inside the init.js file, i get undefined or null
[02:45:54] <wiherek> Hi
[02:46:30] <SoulRaven> the strange thing, i when i call again the dialog, the init.js is working just fine
[02:46:34] <wiherek> i am trying to load some html into a placeholder. Basically everything works, just not the last line (cant load profile.html) http://jsfiddle.net/PSe3j/
[02:46:41] <Xotix> whats the best wy to get something like while hvoering over an element do foo? mouseenter/leave?
[02:46:51] <hlve> aaronmcadam are you trying to post 10,000+ characters?
[02:46:51] <hlve> lol
[02:46:54] <SoulRaven> but is buess because is from a cache
[02:47:18] <hlve> SoulRaven, wait just a few minutes, there are a few guys around here that can help you I'm sure
[02:47:23] <hlve> it's 6AM on the east coast, lol
[02:47:32] <aaronmcadam> hove yeah, it's json in a cms
[02:47:34] <SoulRaven> but the first time when i call the dialog with this content, the init.js from my html content, miss to get the elements inside the content
[02:48:05] <SoulRaven> here is 12.44 EET
[02:48:23] <hlve> aaronmcadam - you're pretty much just limited by your php memory_limit.
[02:48:37] <aaronmcadam> hlve: ahhh man!
[02:48:37] <hlve> ah json
[02:49:02] <aaronmcadam> hlve: it's not me who's coding it
[02:49:08] <hlve> Ah :3
[02:49:15] <aaronmcadam> hlve: I wouldn't use php
[02:49:18] <aaronmcadam> :)
[02:49:20] <hlve> Haha. ;P
[02:51:00] <Xotix> if i do $(this).wrap('<div class="editableContent" />'); how can i delete this div without deleting its content?
[02:51:10] <aaronmcadam> hlve: are you sure? 37375 chars?
[02:51:27] <hlve> Pretttttttttty sure. i've seen press release sites with more characters alotted
[02:51:36] <SoulRaven> Xotix: copy the content outside the div, then delete de div
[02:51:47] <aaronmcadam> cheers dude, I miss python already :)
[02:51:57] <aaronmcadam> (moved companies)
[02:52:22] <LordThumper> Xotix: unwrap works
[02:52:54] <LordThumper> $(".editableContent").children("div").unwrap()
[02:53:36] <LordThumper> $(".editableContent").children().unwrap()
[02:53:41] <LordThumper> That works too
[02:53:45] <Xotix> LordThumper: I'm trying out this atm
[02:53:48] <Whirl3d__> hive: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/uS9RZ/28/
[02:54:01] <Whirl3d__> got it I am pretty sure
[02:54:12] <Xotix> LordThumper:  ah nice to knwo that you cann use a whole selection. :) thanks
[02:54:19] <LordThumper> np
[02:55:46] <Whirl3d__> hive
[02:59:10] * Whirl3d__ wraps his fingers around hive's drunken throat....pay attention to me
[02:59:16] <Whirl3d__> lol
[02:59:59] <xec> it's not "hive" it's "hlve"
[03:00:06] <hlve> ^^ ;P
[03:00:10] <hlve> Sorry
[03:00:12] <xec> much harder to pronounce though
[03:00:29] <hlve> YOU ARE A WIZARD
[03:00:30] <hlve> AND I LOVE YOU
[03:00:58] <Whirl3d__> lol
[03:00:58] <hlve> Trying on the forums real quick, one sec.
[03:01:03] <SoulRaven> i guess is something related to the async load of ajax, but i am not sure, because is strange
[03:01:22] <Whirl3d__> the type is so small on my screen that I can never tell the ls from the i's
[03:01:28] <Whirl3d__> ioi  (just kidding)
[03:01:59] <Xotix> Isn't this valid? $('#editor > .editor-img, #editor > .editor-text')
[03:02:28] <Whirl3d__> im sure it could be done a lot better, it's kind of an ugly solution, but at least now I know what you were trying to accompplish.
[03:02:50] <xec> Xotix: it's fine, depending on what you want, of course
[03:02:56] <Whirl3d__> Eviltwin could do it in one line, less than 25 characters, I feel certain. LOL
[03:03:29] <Xotix> sec ok thanks
[03:04:28] <LordThumper> $('#editor").children(".editor-img, .editor-text")
[03:04:29] <LordThumper> :P
[03:04:36] <xec> Xotix: although you could also do something like $("#editor").children(".editor-text, .editor-img")
[03:04:38] <xec> lol yes
[03:04:46] <LordThumper> I win
[03:04:51] <xec> dammit LordThumper
[03:04:52] <LordThumper> Can I claim my cookie
[03:04:54] <LordThumper> ?
[03:04:55] <LordThumper> :P
[03:04:58] * xec hides in a corner and cries
[03:04:58] <hlve> I am forever in your debt!
[03:05:00] <hlve> thank you SO much!
[03:05:26] * LordThumper gives xec his golden cookie
[03:05:34] <xec> awwww that's so sweet
[03:05:41] <xec> probably because it's full of sugar
[03:05:45] <LordThumper> hehe
[03:05:48] <wiherek> i am trying to .load some html into a placeholder. Basically everything works, except when trying to load new content from a callback: http://jsfiddle.net/PSe3j/
[03:05:58] <wiherek> whats wrong with that code?
[03:07:07] <xec> wiherek: what works, what doesnt? that demo doesn't seem to do anything at all, missing html etc?
[03:07:36] <xec> also: holy mother of nesting!
[03:07:41] <wiherek> xec - the demo won't work on the test server due to same origin policy
[03:08:16] <xec> wiherek: oh i see. well, make a demo that uses jsfiddle's built in echo ajax thing
[03:08:38] <wiherek> it doesnt really work without callbacks (it takes more time to load the html then to execute the next function - or so I guess -> jquery is asynchronous, right?
[03:08:39] <xec> wiherek: and explain what you're trying to do, and comment the code :D
[03:08:57] <Xotix> xec of course hmm anyway thanks :)
[03:09:46] <xec> wiherek: correct, but when you're nesting 4-5 levels deep of callbacks and handlers maybe you should read up on deferreds
[03:10:21] <xec> wiherek: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[03:10:27] <wiherek> reading that now :)
[03:12:49] <wiherek> heres with comments
[03:12:50] <wiherek> http://jsfiddle.net/PSe3j/1/
[03:14:11] <xec> wiherek: ok you can move the .bind() outside of the load callback and use .on()'s delegate syntax like so: $("#mydiv").on("click", "#btnSubmitLogin", func)
[03:14:51] <xec> wiherek: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[03:16:20] <xec> wiherek: that said, i don't see anything inherently wrong with your code - you're sure the selectors are correct? any errors in console?
[03:16:42] <wiherek> no errors :( trying your code now
[03:17:41] <wiherek> unfortunately cant use that - jquery 1.5.2
[03:17:55] <aaronmcadam> whaaa
[03:18:03] <aaronmcadam> why u no 1.7.2? :o
[03:18:09] <wiherek> drupal.
[03:18:22] <aaronmcadam> ah jesus
[03:18:33] <xec> wiherek: i'd recommend upgrading... but in 1.5.2 you still have .delegate() available which does the same job http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:18:33] <aaronmcadam> and upgrading breaks their plugins?
[03:18:43] <aaronmcadam> yeah on just unifies the APIs
[03:19:23] <xec> i heard they renamed the project to "druFAIL" officially by the way </troll>
[03:19:34] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[03:19:41] <aaronmcadam> surely it can't break that much
[03:19:47] <aaronmcadam> and if it does, just change the plugins
[03:20:02] <aaronmcadam> depends on how wrapped up they are
[03:21:08] <wiherek> yea i just asked if it breaks, cant be arsed testing everything :) but drupals alrite though. currently building an app with node.js, socket.io and mongoDB and got that connected to Drupal (uses drupal as backend)
[03:23:22] <xec> tbh i haven't had too much to do with drupal, i've just seen a lot of really smart people struggle with it, which to me is a bad omen ;)
[03:23:44] <wiherek> im not that smart though
[03:24:50] <wiherek> xec: your tip with delegate worked, thanks!
[03:24:58] <xec> yw :)
[03:36:47] <SoulRaven> way a js function is not executed inside a html ajax retrun?
[03:42:11] <crazy_phone> hey all
[03:42:15] <crazy_phone> i have a question
[03:42:21] <crazy_phone> when i do a changePage
[03:42:28] <crazy_phone> and pass arguments via
[03:42:35] <crazy_phone> the data: {}
[03:42:42] <crazy_phone> how do i access them on the new page
[03:42:49] <crazy_phone> im talking about a hybrid app
[03:42:55] <crazy_phone> on a phone
[03:43:25] <crazy_phone> anyone ?
[03:45:38] <timing> it's probably in your get of post data
[03:50:19] <crazy_phone> any other suggestions
[03:50:26] <crazy_phone> i think it is something with jqmdata()
[03:50:33] <crazy_phone> or stuff like that but i cant find it
[03:50:43] <crazy_phone> i mean there should be jqm method about that
[03:50:53] <crazy_phone> or i have to go plain js ?
[03:52:47] <crazy_phone> none knows ?
[03:52:53] <crazy_phone> or more like none reads :D
[03:54:03] <almig> Hi there. I am using $("#myId").val("") to cleanup the contents of an input element and it works fine. However when I submit my form the previous content of the input element before the submission is loaded into the database.
[03:54:26] <almig> Anyone knows what I am doing wrong?
[03:56:37] <crazy_phone> try
[03:56:52] <crazy_phone> $("#myID").empty();
[03:57:00] <crazy_phone> almig
[03:59:16] <almig> crazy_phone: doesn't work either...
[04:00:14] <almig> That's vey odd because when I execute the $("#myID").val() to get the contents of the filed it returns me "" as expected...
[04:00:40] <crazy_phone> hmmm
[04:01:08] <crazy_phone> $("#myID").html("");
[04:01:09] <crazy_phone> ?
[04:01:15] <crazy_phone> this almig
[04:01:17] <crazy_phone> ?
[04:02:14] <SoulRaven> way a js function is not executed inside a html ajax retrun?
[04:02:32] <crazy_phone> what you mean SoulRaven ?
[04:02:38] <crazy_phone> pastebin some example code
[04:02:45] <fRAiLtY-> Why does this work here http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/46/ but not here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing (click Price Matrix). The columns don't highlight but the rows do?
[04:02:49] <SoulRaven> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1049768752
[04:02:52] <SoulRaven> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1852473111
[04:02:58] <SoulRaven> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1555235999
[04:03:01] <almig> crazy_phone: same result here
[04:03:16] <almig> this is because I am changinf an attribute value
[04:03:28] <SoulRaven> first bin is the html code that is parsed using ajax on the ui dialog
[04:03:34] <almig> <input value="">blabla</input>
[04:03:50] <SoulRaven> secound is the code that is on init.js from the first html content
[04:03:52] <almig> empty() and html will apply to "blabla" in the example above
[04:04:32] <SoulRaven> and the thirh is the ajax method that call the html content and put the content inside the dialog
[04:05:05] <SoulRaven> problem is that when i call the html content using ajax, the content is parsed but the js methods inside the html contend are not executed
[04:05:37] <SoulRaven> and js methods, works only after a secound call of ajax and repopulating the dialog
[04:09:13] <nebmo> hi, i'm trying to make a lock/unlock toggle form. how do I convert the fields into plain html after submitting (eg: <input ... value="abc".../> to just "abc") and vice versa? (http://jsfiddle.net/Hq2Q7/)
[04:14:56] <LordThumper> nebmo
[04:15:01] <LordThumper> Something like this?
[04:15:01] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/Hq2Q7/1/
[04:19:53] <zatan> hey how can I find out what text is inside <th> ? $('#foo th') ?
[04:20:29] <johnkpaul> ?text @zatan
[04:20:30] <caniuse> johnkpaul: .text(): Set the content of each element in the set of matched elements to the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[04:20:55] <zatan> cheers
[04:21:24] <nebmo> LordTumper: exactly!!! :)
[04:29:52] <LordThumper> nebmo: Also http://jsfiddle.net/Hq2Q7/2/
[04:31:10] <nebmo> nice one. so to make all fields in a particular form (and NOT hidden elements): $("#" + form_ID + " :input:not(input[type=hidden])") ?
[04:31:26] <negev> hi, is it possible to have a jquery slider with a range that changes the increment at parts of the scale?  i.e.  -20 through -10 in .5 increments, then -10 through +10 in .25 increments, then back to 0.5 for +10 through +20?
[04:31:30] <nebmo> hmm, it still converts the submit button.
[04:32:40] <jeffsmykil> I'm trying to set options on a jquery widget but not havbing much luck, this is the syntax I am using: http://pastebin.com/8Td573NQ
[04:37:37] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: have you tried setting it individually?
[04:40:09] <jeffsmykil> you mean each option?
[04:42:05] <johnkpaul> yeah, I don't know of option() takes an obj of options
[04:42:54] <jeffsmykil> if it doesn;'t that feels like a major shortcomming
[04:43:49] <johnkpaul> well, there is setOptions() on a ui widget
[04:43:54] <johnkpaul> different than setOption
[04:44:28] <jeffsmykil> yeah if you send an object it's supposed to just automagically go to setoptions iirc
[04:44:52] <johnkpaul> tbh, I don't know
[04:45:01] <milligan> Are there any reasons jquery wouldn't work on a host? I am trying to write a little script for a mikrotik wise unit .. and some getJSON requests are just dying without any errors or anything ...
[04:46:07] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano would certainly know, of course I probably wouldn't understand lol
[04:47:54] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: I wish there was a jquery ui source viewer
[04:48:21] <jeffsmykil> how do you mean?
[04:48:53] <milligan> Anybody ?
[04:48:58] <DarkKnight> yeah ?
[04:49:11] <jeffsmykil> milligan are you making cross domain ajax requests?
[04:49:25] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: I haven't used jquery ui in a long time, and this would be really easy to understand from the source, but I don't have the unminified source vailable easily for me to search
[04:49:31] <milligan> jeffsmykil, yes. Trying to reach an IP.
[04:50:08] <jeffsmykil> milligan: you need to use jsonp
[04:50:21] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide19
[04:50:25] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: I see
[04:50:41] <DarkKnigh> hello
[04:50:55] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: unfortunately 1,9 is still in development
[04:51:10] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: I know, I just meant to show you the source of setOption
[04:51:14] <johnkpaul> in 1.8
[04:51:30] <johnkpaul> ?g what is jsonp remy sharp @ milligan
[04:51:32] <bot-t> milligan, What is JSONP? - remy sharp's b:log - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[04:51:48] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: also, that presentation should be useful
[04:52:03] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: yeah I have tried using it in the past
[04:52:13] <jeffsmykil> its an itsy bitsy bit over my head still
[04:52:23] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: this is what im working with
[04:52:23] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/4Js8yiLb
[04:53:23] <johnkpaul> hm, so I think that _setOptions is breaking some assumptions about what jquery ui expects setoptions to do
[04:54:47] <jeffsmykil> my issue is the intial initiation works fine
[04:55:12] <jeffsmykil> you would think you could make the same thing later and it would run through setoption
[04:55:42] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: add a breakpoint in _setOptions and check when you call .widget("option", objOfOptions),  that the breakpoint is hit
[04:57:01] <fRAiLtY-> Why does this work here http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/46/ but not here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing (click Price Matrix). The columns don't highlight but the rows do?
[04:57:15] <FJ1> how can i catch a "302" via ajax call?
[04:57:40] <FJ1> i get always "200" status
[04:57:46] <boehmer> i am using jQueryUI Tabs. i am quite unhappy because it breaks my CSS rules inside the content container below the tab buttons. e.g. it's sets the colors of links, correct for UI elements but it inherits to /all/ elements in the container:( can i solve it in a nice way or is it kind of a bug in jQueryUI or the tabs controller?
[04:58:02] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: it is hitting, how very strange
[04:58:13] <milligan> johnkpaul, jeffsmykil , is jsonp part of jquery, or do I need the library offered on google code?
[04:58:27] <johnkpaul> ?getjson @milligan
[04:58:27] <bot-t> milligan, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[04:58:32] <johnkpaul> milligan: take a look at those docs
[04:58:46] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: that makes sense, I think that you are breaking the contract of setOptions, by not setting options
[04:59:04] <johnkpaul> FJ1: sadly you cannot catch a redirect using xhr
[04:59:18] <milligan> johnkpaul, yes .. getJSON dies silently, and I get no connections to my receiving server. If I write the $.ajax() from scratch, it will throw an error in my handler, but the error message will be empty.
[04:59:35] <johnkpaul> milligan: :) did you read those docs? serch for jsonp
[04:59:41] <johnkpaul> search*

[05:00:19] <FJ1> @johnkpaul thx :-/
[05:00:20] <RohanBhangui> link
[05:00:31] <jimbo> or jquery in general
[05:00:34] <jeffsmykil> jimbo let me guess working with local xml files?
[05:00:34] <jimbo> my code doesnt run
[05:00:38] <jimbo> no
[05:00:47] <jimbo> just jquery css and html
[05:00:48] <jimbo> thats it
[05:00:52] <jimbo> simple
[05:00:53] <jimbo> very
[05:00:59] <jeffsmykil> jsfiddle it
[05:01:05] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/A6qVZ/3/
[05:01:41] <jimbo> my code is here http://jsfiddle.net/mCwH4/2/
[05:01:52] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: is it confusing it or am I just a moron?
[05:02:26] <jeffsmykil> doesnt seem to work in firefox either?
[05:02:42] <jimbo> no it works in firefox
[05:02:49] <jimbo> and IE
[05:03:07] <RohanBhangui> nvm fixed
[05:03:50] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: you're not a moron at all, and everything is confusing in programming before you understand it
[05:03:50] <milligan> johnkpaul, still no difference.. neither with the google version of the stock one. no errors.. no connection to my  server.
[05:04:02] <johnkpaul> I need to get breakfast , but I'll be back later
[05:04:15] <jeffsmykil> ok thanks for the help you provided
[05:04:51] <jimbo> why ask jeffsmykil it doesnt work for you?
[05:05:39] <jeffsmykil> not in jsfiddle
[05:05:50] <jimbo> what doesnt work
[05:05:52] <jimbo> the images are not there
[05:05:56] <jimbo> so you get blank image
[05:05:58] <jimbo> but the rest works
[05:06:04] <jimbo> you can see them loop
[05:07:04] <jeffsmykil> I don't understand why _setOption can't just take a number of options instead of having to call _setOptions
[05:10:08] <jimbo> u talking to me jeff
[05:18:14] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: because that's the way that the jquery ui widget factory expects it to be
[05:18:29] <johnkpaul> it's the contract that jquery ui widget creators get into, in order to buy into the system
[05:19:06] <johnkpaul> similar to how if you add window.jQuery = function(){alert("ITSBROKE")}, your code will stop working correctly ;)
[05:20:15] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: just wish I could find a very simple example that sets multiple options at once
[05:20:41] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: your original code will work, if you revert your overridden definition of _setOptions
[05:21:10] <johnkpaul> _setOptions is intended to be private anyway, why are you overriding it to do something completely different?
[05:21:40] <jeffsmykil> im not trying to
[05:21:47] <jeffsmykil> I guess I just don't understand completely
[05:22:23] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: have you read this? http://bililite.com/blog/understanding-jquery-ui-widgets-a-tutorial/
[05:22:42] <jeffsmykil> no that's the one I mnot sure I have seen
[05:22:53] <jeffsmykil> oh wait i have
[05:22:56] <jeffsmykil> but ill read it again
[05:26:26] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: even if i do soething simple like this though its not catching on setoption

[05:26:31] <sgp913> hello, i'm trying to work with an output of <li>imageaddress.jpg</li> and turn that into an image carousel. i cannot alter the source...does anyone have a recommendation of how to deal with this?
[05:26:43] <johnkpaul> ?g jcarousellite @ sgp913
[05:26:44] <bot-t> sgp913, jCarousel Lite - http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/
[05:27:06] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: that code is still not obeying the contract
[05:27:10] <johnkpaul> just remove lines 26-29
[05:27:49] <sgp913> johnkpaul, i know how to build a carousel haha, the problem is that the <img> tag isnt being pushed
[05:28:10] <sgp913> only the <li> with just the .img location
[05:28:12] <johnkpaul> oh, you mean how to convert a <li>imgsrcurl</li>
[05:28:23] <johnkpaul> into a <li><img src="imgsrcurl"></li>?
[05:28:28] <sgp913> yep!
[05:28:31] <sigwhite> Is there any way using AMD to prevent jQuery from leaking into the global namespace?
[05:28:56] <sgp913> or maybe there's a carousel that will just do it by itself?
[05:29:02] <boehmer> is it supposed to be that jquery UI widgets which contain page content apply styles to the content?
[05:29:04] <johnkpaul> sgp913: no, you'll need to do that ocnversion yourself
[05:29:11] <sgp913> that's where i'm lost
[05:29:34] <boehmer> i have a tabs UI widget and several internal UI styles are applied to my content, e.g. making links invisible
[05:30:01] <sgp913> i'm good at copy pasting things i know work in one situation and altering for another, but writing from scratch, i never actually learned javascript/jquery fully (like most people, i think)
[05:30:06] <johnkpaul> sgp913: $("li").each(function(i,el){var $el = $(el);$el.html($("<img>",{src:$el.text()}))})
[05:30:06] <boehmer> i don't like jQuery UI defining some styles inherited by the normal page content
[05:30:17] <johnkpaul> sgp913: so now is your opportunity to learn
[05:30:27] <johnkpaul> look through the code that I just gave you, that is probably buggy because I've never tried it
[05:30:35] <johnkpaul> look in the jquery docs for everything I'm doing
[05:30:40] <johnkpaul> and ask if you hav e questions
[05:30:56] <sgp913> johnkpaul, cool, thanks for the head start
[05:31:08] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: OK I can get setOption working to change one option
[05:31:21] <jeffsmykil> if i try and change more than one it hits setoption four times of course
[05:31:48] <johnkpaul> that's correct behavior, no?
[05:32:43] <jeffsmykil> yeah but i want to wait until all four are changed before I do something
[05:33:35] <astropirate> Anyone looking for a freelance js/jquery/nodejs developer? :) pm me
[05:35:08] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: then write a new method that takes all four, set them, and then do dsomething
[05:35:53] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: I was under the impression thats what setoptions was for
[05:37:18] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: you can call _setOptions from your new method, but you can't overwrrite it
[05:37:50] <johnkpaul> as a bad analogy, when you write your own code to set multiple css options, you don't override jQuery.fn.css, you write a new function that calls that
[05:42:27] <sgp913> johnkpaul, that did the trick, thanks so much for your help
[05:42:32] <sgp913> johnkpaul++
[05:42:35] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: still thinking about your analogy
[05:43:09] <johnkpaul> no problem sgp913, have fun!
[05:43:46] <sgp913> now time to put the carousel in the iphone app, hope nothing clashes...!!
[05:44:06] <jeffsmykil> but if I call a function from within _setoption its going to get called as many times as options as I send it
[05:45:46] <milligan> Someone please explain to me why this doesn't work: http://pastebin.com/Q4qNA0p5 . I know with 100% certainty that ValidateEmail() return true. The result handler (function(data)) never gets hit. I presume that means that the callback is never received.. ?
[05:47:17] <milligan> There are no errors on the javascript console etc..

[06:00:50] <johnkpaul> jeffsmykil: I don't mean call something from within _setOption
[06:00:59] <johnkpaul> I mean call a different methd that you write, that calls setOption
[06:01:33] <johnkpaul> milligan: are you sure that your http://ip/ url response to JSONP correctly?
[06:01:39] <johnkpaul> can you pastebin the output of that url

[06:02:53] <johnkpaul> if you dont' want that, then call _setOptions once, and then do whatever you need to do

[06:02:56] <fusion27> the selector + blur + each
[06:02:57] <fusion27> ?
[06:03:03] <johnkpaul> milligan: then you are not using jsonp correctly

[06:03:13] <adept-phil> anyone see what's wrong with this?.... http://jsfiddle.net/GSXfL/
[06:03:17] <johnkpaul> milligan: it should be callbackName([result,true])
[06:03:23] <jeffsmykil> johnkpaul: ok thats good, I lke that, but how do I onlycall it once?
[06:03:36] <johnkpaul> it's your own method, call it whenever you want

[06:19:00] <nicesukhi> sacho: what I want is to add click event to already created object but don't know to do it without touched that  constructor
[06:20:05] <sacho> Drupal.jsAC.click()...
[06:20:16] <sacho> or well, $(Drupal.jsAC)
[06:20:55] <nicesukhi> in that case it says click is not function
[06:22:52] <fusion27> adept-phil: sorry, I gotta run in to a meeting, started in on your solution, hope this can help http://jsfiddle.net/cmKaD/1/
[06:23:07] <wiherek> I need to somehow refer to selectors that aren't loaded at the time the function is called. Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/Yj5Qz/3/
[06:23:53] <jrockjiggz> Hi, when i load my ajax in using a fragment, or by narrowing my html by data.html('#el'). the <script> js inside that element won't execute
[06:23:54] <wiherek> It works if I add setTimeout in the second file, but I'd like to avoid that
[06:26:36] <nicesukhi> sacho: I tried this Drupal.jsAC.prototype.click but it also not working
[06:27:42] <sacho> $(Drupal.jsAC.input).click()
[06:28:32] <nicesukhi> sacho: did you see the constructor http://pastebin.com/9MQCi4vR
[06:29:56] <nicesukhi> sacho: tried 	$(Drupal.jsAC.input).click() not working
[06:31:27] <sacho> I saw the constructor
[06:31:58] <sacho> you have some ridiculous aliasing going on there.
[06:32:19] <sacho> But anyway, "doesn't work" is not a javascript error
[06:33:06] <nicesukhi> want to add click event - .click(function () { ac.hidePopup(); ac.db.cancel(); })
[06:33:14] <wiherek> whats the usual practice in using elements that aren't yet loaded as selectors? setTimeout? basically I mean something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Yj5Qz/3/ it works if I add setTimeout in the second file, but otherwise - it doesnt work. I have a feeling im doing something wrong
[06:33:34] <sacho> where do you think that ac comes from?
[06:34:15] <sacho> wiherek, see live() and on()
[06:34:24] <nicesukhi> sacho: if see the code at line number 5: var ac = this; - this is basically a object of input field
[06:34:59] <wiherek> I know - I already use on in the example. but see the callback for the on function
[06:35:01] <sacho> nicesukhi, either you're guessing at how to write javascript(go get a tutorial then), or I have no idea what you want to do
[06:35:08] <sacho> Start by giving examples.
[06:35:44] <sacho> If you want to add an event listener to a dom element, you add it through one of jquery's ways to add it - ie click().
[06:37:09] <sacho> Use a preload buffer and add received messages from the buffer in the success callback of the load
[06:37:21] <nicesukhi> sacho: ok here is the senario I am using Drupal autocomplete functionality, under that there no click event mentioned see this - this is autocomplete.js http://pastebin.com/6LtxcF0C
[06:37:34] <sacho> in fact you could do
[06:37:45] <adept-phil> anyone see what's wrong with this?.... http://jsfiddle.net/GSXfL/
[06:37:48] <adept-phil> for some reason on the 2nd+ iterations, currentSlide returns -1?
[06:37:49] <nicesukhi> sacho: so I want to add click event without touching this js file at all but with my own js
[06:37:49] <sacho> updatechat -> add to buffer, trigger event on holder which walks the buffer and appends messages
[06:37:56] <wiherek> sacho: something you $(document).Event  ?
[06:38:09] <wiherek> hmm
[06:38:21] <sacho> while the holder doesn't exist, triggering the event doesn't do anything
[06:38:26] <wiherek> i meant $(document).trigger("somecustomevent")
[06:38:41] <sacho> as soon as the holder exists, and has a handler listening for the event, it'll start processing your buffer.
[06:39:18] <sacho> But it's still a good idea to also check the buffer as soon as it loads(ie all messages have already been received and none are coming soon when it loads)
[06:40:22] <sacho> nicesukhi, so wherever you have your dom element, wrap it in a jquery object, and create the onclick event
[06:40:47] <sacho> in your case the dom element is Drupal.jsAC.input
[06:41:44] <sacho> urgh
[06:42:10] <wiherek> sacho: so something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Yj5Qz/5/
[06:42:44] <sacho> Obviously ac doesn't exist outside the constructor's context, but since it's just an alias for this, which happens to be a reference to the object being constructed, ac === this === wherever you create the object
[06:43:22] <sacho> Uh, not really
[06:45:08] <wiherek> sacho :)
[06:46:13] <carloescobar> Could someone take a quick look at this and tell me if I'm way of in my thinking? I know the markup isn't right but you get the idea; http://jsfiddle.net/BkXuW/1/
[06:46:25] <carloescobar> (off)
[06:46:42] <adept-phil> I doubt it carloescobar ... I've been asking for someone to take a look at my jsfiddle for 30  mins now and nothing...
[06:47:11] <carloescobar> I've gotten help here before, some times it just takes a little while before someone can help out. :)
[06:47:22] <wiherek> sacho: so.. what am I doing wrong here?
[06:47:45] <sacho> Well, you won't put any messages in the text area after the "alldonehere" event
[06:48:07] <sacho> but even logically, you don't want the textarea "polling" for data
[06:48:20] <sacho> You want your updatechat to trigger the textarea into action
[06:48:58] <wiherek> I don't think so.. this is socket.io
[06:48:59] <sacho> carloescobar, that's not javascript
[06:49:44] <carloescobar> No, the markup is all stupid. But the general idea, that's what I'm asking about
[06:50:02] <carloescobar> js handles if-statements, right?
[06:50:07] <wiherek> the first part is jqeury, the second file is pretty much socket.io client getting messages from socket.io server (node.js) and outputting data into html
[06:50:30] <DerekPioneer> i've got a piece of code like: $j(this.$el).find('img').load(function() { this.$el.hideLoading() });    the problem is that the img that it is looking for is displayed during multiple tabs in my javascript application.
[06:50:36] <NodeX> socket.io / long poll - both work
[06:51:05] <DerekPioneer> each time the img is loaded, regardless of if it is visible or not, the function inside of load fires multiple times for each
[06:51:21] <sacho> wiherek, http://jsfiddle.net/Yj5Qz/6/
[06:51:53] <DerekPioneer> $j(this.$el).find('img').load(function()  to only fire on visible images
[06:51:55] <sacho> Some of the comments indicate missing code
[06:52:04] <sacho> the buffer ones
[06:53:21] <pachet> carloescobar: http://jsfiddle.net/BhEgx/
[06:53:27] <pachet> carloescobar: go learn javascript
[06:53:39] <pachet> if ( you know it ) { it will be easier to do simple things like this }
[06:53:53] <adept-phil> carloescobar: is this what you wanted?
[06:53:53] <adept-phil> http://jsfiddle.net/BkXuW/2/
[06:54:28] <carloescobar> Thanks guys.
[06:54:34] <wiherek> sacho: why is that more logical? speaking in terms of MVC models --- I wanted my jquery.js file to only output the view (as in - build html placeholders), my socket.js (node.js client) to process all the data and mongoDB for the model.
[06:54:35] <carloescobar> Yes, I should learn JS, I know. :)
[06:54:51] <pachet> adept-phil: need a space after your else if :[
[06:55:03] <sacho> wiherek, because socket.io is the one handling new data, polling from the textarea end would be more inefficient
[06:55:04] <carloescobar> pachet version doesn't show the second div (#bilde) and your's doesn't seem to do anything for me at all adept-phil
[06:55:17] <carloescobar> Appreciate the help though
[06:55:28] <carloescobar> Should be able to fix the rest my self
[06:55:47] <sacho> wiherek, for example with your code you'd need a setInterval() constantly doing .trigger('alldonehere')
[06:55:48] <pachet> carloescobar: hint: check the id for the element you think should be referenced by #bilde
[06:55:50] <wiherek> sacho: i am not sure if we're talking about the same thing
[06:55:59] <carloescobar> pachet: Thanks
[06:57:21] <sacho> I don't know which jquery.js and socket.js is
[06:57:36] <wiherek> http://jsfiddle.net/Yj5Qz/7/
[06:57:44] <sacho> but if the excerpts are from each file accordingly, then we are talking about the same thing
[06:57:46] <wiherek> (I used my revision)
[07:01:18] <sacho> yeah
[07:01:31] <sacho> Notice that your socket.io has a piece of html in it :p
[07:01:56] <sacho> so jquery.js isn't outputting the view there
[07:03:09] <wiherek> that's true
[07:03:26] <sacho> at any rate
[07:03:54] <batterhead> hello everyone
[07:04:07] <sacho> if you want it to work that way, the socket.io event handler will have to check if ChatField exists, if it does -> just append, if not, do the delegate, which is also kinda yucky since every message creates an eventlistener to be executed...
[07:04:32] <wiherek> aha
[07:04:44] <sacho> ..you could create a buffer to hold those messages and have just one event listener for alldonehere pushing all the buffered data changes, but then, you're getting close to my suggestion
[07:05:22] <sacho> s/changes/messages
[07:06:09] <batterhead> any suggestions for technique? i have a div i am hovering and showing a kind of tooltip. I want to be able to move the mouse from the triggering div to the tooltip which has some links. I can't wrap them in a parent div due to the structure, so i'm not sure how to make the tooltip wait a second before closing so it can get the mouseenter. thoughts?
[07:06:47] <DerekPioneer> how do you guys load images? like if i'm replacing the html of a div with a couple new images, am i still supposed to do the the blah = new Image(); thing?
[07:07:41] <wiherek> sacho: i am only worried of having to add variables to the jquery file - that's something I wanted to avoid (but maybe I was just making a mistake)
[07:07:50] <batterhead> @DerekPioneer that would depend on what the html is that you are replacing I would think
[07:08:24] <DerekPioneer> batterhead: what if it's just replacing an <img src="" /> between two divs?
[07:08:30] <DerekPioneer> between two div tags*
[07:09:01] <batterhead> DerekPioneer: are you just replacing the image with a new one?
[07:09:06] <DerekPioneer> yeah
[07:09:21] <DerekPioneer> users move boxes around and it generates dynamic images
[07:10:02] <batterhead> $('#myImg').prop('src', '/path/to/new/image.png');
[07:10:26] <DerekPioneer> and then just do $('#myImg').load(function() {}) ?
[07:10:28] <DerekPioneer> to see when it's loaded
[07:10:30] <DerekPioneer> that's what i'm asking
[07:11:02] <batterhead> when you change the src prop of an image it loads it immediately
[07:11:17] <DerekPioneer> i mean what if it's a slower image
[07:11:46] <batterhead> preload the images?
[07:12:32] <DerekPioneer> is that the way to load images? show a loading bar, preload the image, change the img src, hide the loading bar?
[07:12:59] <batterhead> is it a set number of images possible to show?
[07:13:08] <DerekPioneer> yeah
[07:13:14] <batterhead> you can just pre-load the images into the DOM and they will load fast
[07:13:36] <batterhead> var images = [ 	'/path/to/image1.png', 	'/path/to/image2.png' ];  $(images).each(function() { 	var image = $('<img />').attr('src', this); });
[07:13:56] <amaroks> Hello
[07:14:17] <DerekPioneer> ohh that looks nice. do you then append the image var
[07:14:23] <DerekPioneer> or is it just preloaded and ready to go wherever
[07:14:30] <amaroks> document.cookie = "name=value; expires=date; what i should I use instead of "date" to make it expire in 7 days
[07:14:59] <batterhead> yes, you can modify that so each image has a unique id and then just get at them that way
[07:15:40] <DerekPioneer> sweet, thanks
[07:15:45] <batterhead> wurd
[07:16:30] <batterhead> damn, use prop() not attr()
[07:22:13] <pachet> attr is preferred
[07:22:18] <pachet> src is an HTML attribute
[07:22:20] <pachet> :[
[07:22:52] <NodeX> prop() get's them all
[07:26:15] <batterhead> pretty sure I sat in a talk at jqcon that said to use prop() rather than attr() for image src
[07:26:45] <QueueQueue> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874652/prop-vs-attr
[07:27:34] <batterhead> QueueQueue: exactly
[07:29:26] <DerekPioneer> var img = $j('<img />').prop('src', src);
[07:29:32] <DerekPioneer> how do i tell when that image is loaded?
[07:29:58] <ravenz> ?load @ DerekPioneer
[07:29:58] <bot-t> DerekPioneer, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:30:09] <DerekPioneer> hmm ok i must be using load wrong then
[07:30:12] <_archer_> DerekPioneer $(img).load(function() { ... } );
[07:30:19] <_archer_> heh
[07:30:38] <ravenz> DerekPioneer the image is not loaded until you append it to the dom iirc
[07:30:53] <_archer_> DerekPioneer if it's cached then that may not fire.  You need to check afterwards if (img.complete) { img.load(); }
[07:31:11] <_archer_> and yes, that is syntactically correct - it should be img.complete, not $(img).complete
[07:31:46] <pachet> batterhead, QueueQueue: i agree in most cases
[07:32:00] <pachet> to complicate things, changes to the property 'src' propagate to the actual dom attribute
[07:32:34] <pachet> NodeX: and prop() definitely doesn't get them all
[07:32:41] <pachet> insomuch as 'all' could mean custom attributes
[07:32:53] <pachet> it only fetches those attributes that the browser takes the time to enumerate as props on the dom elem
[07:34:07] <NodeX> yup - all ;)
[07:34:18] <NodeX> or all "valid"
[07:36:38] <pachet> ok, valid works as a qualifier if we're talking about HTML
[07:36:41] <pachet> but what about XML ;[
[07:37:18] <NodeX> XML = old tech
[07:37:26] <NodeX> so I don't care about it ;)
[07:37:28] <pachet> html = old tech?
[07:37:41] <NodeX> old but still relevant to me
[07:37:47] <pachet> there we are
[07:37:51] <NodeX> XML is not because I dont process it with Jquery
[07:37:51] <amaroks> document.cookie = "name=value; expires=date; what i should I use instead of "date" to make it expire in 7 days
[07:37:59] <NodeX> I have sense not to lol
[07:40:14] <DerekPioneer> _archer_: i'm still a little confused on those couple lines for image preloading. http://jsfiddle.net/NgGYj/
[07:42:38] <DerekPioneer> batterhead: thoughts? ^, still having trouble understanding load() on elements in the dom
[07:44:28] <batterhead> DerekPioneer: because it's already loaded when you make that call to load
[07:44:46] <DerekPioneer> but if i don't make that call to load
[07:44:52] <DerekPioneer> then my loading bar never shows
[07:44:57] <DerekPioneer> and the image just changes from image to image
[07:44:59] <DerekPioneer> with no transition
[07:45:01] <batterhead> DerekPioneer: when you do this var img = $j('<img />').prop('src', src); it loads it into the DOM
[07:45:18] <Jon47> DerekPioneer: .load event fires when a resource is finished loading by the browser (in my experience it doesn't fire for resources pulled from cache)
[07:45:46] <Jon47> also you bind to the load event after switching the src, so the image may have finished loading by the time that handler is added
[07:46:15] <_archer_> That's why I suggested the .complete check.  I always use that just to be sure
[07:48:39] <ahandy> hello :D i have a quick question! i have a function called start(first, second), then an if statement that checks for second == TRUE :D if second == TRUE, i get a callstack error in the chrome console, however when it isn't, it works fine
[07:49:17] <pachet> what is TRUE
[07:49:32] <ahandy> pachet: the "second" argument in the function
[07:49:42] <pachet> is it an identifier?
[07:49:49] <NodeX> I think he means what is "TRUE" set as
[07:49:49] <ahandy> pachet: what do you mean
[07:49:54] <pachet> ?eval var TRUE = false; TRUE
[07:49:57] <bot-t> pachet: false
[07:49:59] <NodeX> var TRUE = true; ...
[07:50:14] <ahandy> no no, the check is if(second)
[07:50:19] <ahandy> my bad
[07:50:22] <_archer_> ahandy - can you put the code in jsfiddle so we can see it?  Make sure you get the same error running there
[07:50:45] <_archer_> ahandy - not possible to answer from the info you've given
[07:51:08] <ahandy> lemme see
[07:52:19] <carloescobar> pachet: I just spent an hour looking at it before I saw the #bilde-referance. God damn, I loled so hard. Never felt that stupid in my life.

[07:54:20] <Xotix> hi
[07:54:51] <Xotix> does $().mouseenter() use bind?
[07:56:03] <ebadedude> I would like to have a file upload feature that submits the file object just as a regular form would and only using javascript (i.e. no flash, no applet etc.)
[07:56:27] <MacroMan> Can I select an element based on it's textual content?
[07:56:31] <shoky> Xotix: it's the same as doing bind, yes
[07:56:42] <NoiseEee> MacroMan: its expensive
[07:56:46] <ravenz> ?contains @ MacroMan
[07:56:46] <bot-t> MacroMan, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[07:56:51] <Xotix> shoky thx
[07:56:58] <MacroMan> ravenz: Thanks
[08:04:17] <Xotix> is it possible to make a border around something on hovering but so that it is like on a new z-index or something so it doesn't have any impact on the actual styling? my first idea would be creating a div wit hthe same dimensions with a different z index and position it accordingly but somehow it feels wrong
[08:05:30] <shoky> Xotix: if you dont want to touch the styling then you'll need another element, yea..
[08:05:53] <_archer_> Xotix - have a read of this http://css-tricks.com/image-rollover-borders-that-do-not-change-layout/
[08:06:08] <_archer_> May be useful.  Certainly easier if it is
[08:06:43] <Xotix> _archer_:  thanks :)
[08:07:30] <_archer_> Xotix - no problem.  Had to do the same thing myself not long ago
[08:07:49] <Xotix> :) bb
[08:16:05] <RonWhoCares> I am trying to setup a mouseover .  I expect I am missing something obvious.  Wonder if you could check my code @ http://pastebin.ca/2162913
[08:21:50] <eggsby> hey guys, why would my qunit test die on an thrown error when it is inside of a 'raises()' ?
[08:25:13] <_archer_> RonWhoCares - really not a nice way to do things, but regardless, use $(name_element).src, not name_element.src
[08:25:38] <MacroMan> RonWhoCares: Sorry to be a spoil sport, but none of that code is jQuery. You would be better off asking in the #javascript if you don't want to do it the jQuery way.
[08:26:15] <RonWhoCares> MacroMan Intended to do a JQuery solution
[08:26:24] <RonWhoCares> I am just learning and I didn't realize I was wrong
[08:27:03] <MacroMan> RonWhoCares: No worries. Instead of using onmouseover and onmouseout in the tag, use $('#A').hover()
[08:27:26] <_archer_> MacroMan - var name_element = $('#A');
[08:27:30] <_archer_> what's that? :p
[08:28:32] <RonWhoCares> MacroMan: So I am to take out the mouseover from the tag and not replace it with anything; and what you are showing me goes in the .js file
[08:28:40] <MacroMan> _archer_: Fair point. Didn't really notice that
[08:31:39] <_archer_> MacroMan - it's a horrible mix of pure javascript and a tad of jquery.  You're right to suggest replacing it.
[08:32:53] <MacroMan> RonWhoCares: I've done this one for you. Look at the way I've done it and see if you can understand it: http://jsfiddle.net/s4r7p/
[08:35:13] <MacroMan> RonWhoCares: Oops. Got the hovers the wrong way round: http://jsfiddle.net/s4r7p/1/
[08:36:11] <_archer_> MacroMan - any reason why you use $("#A") in the hover functions, and not $(this)?
[08:36:27] <_archer_> It needs to parse again to find it - not economical
[08:38:57] <carloescobar> I'm having a problem with a snippet not working when incorporated in my site but fine by it self on a fiddle
[08:39:15] <_archer_> carloescobar - can we see your site?
[08:39:26] <carloescobar> www.caks.no/nht
[08:39:34] <MacroMan> _archer_: I just left it there. Should've changed it really.
[08:40:08] <_archer_> MacroMan - I only pointed it out because he said he's new to jQuery.  Don't want to start him learning bad habits!
[08:40:18] <MacroMan> Like me lol
[08:40:22] <_archer_> carloescobar - what's the problem with it?
[08:40:28] <_archer_> Exactly ;) lol
[08:41:34] <carloescobar> yeah, when I press change it should hide the "white-space" div, and show another one. then it should hide that and show a third when you press change again
[08:41:54] <carloescobar> but I'm thinking I've used a earlier fiddle no
[08:41:55] <carloescobar> w
[08:41:57] <carloescobar> so
[08:42:00] <carloescobar> might be that

[08:43:09] <MOOhamHead> I have the DOM in an array/object.  How can I convert that to a block of html text for parsing ?
[08:44:48] <dougb> is there an easy way to turn a list that is loaded via ajax from php's json_encode as a string, into a true javascript list?
[08:45:16] <johnkpaul> ?parseJSON @dougb
[08:45:16] <bot-t> dougb, jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/

[08:46:02] <_archer_> carloescobar - where you have .on("click.mynamespace" etc.  get rid of the .mynamespace.  It should be .on("click", function...
[08:46:03] <carloescobar> _archer_:  Didn't seem to be it.
[08:46:19] <carloescobar> ok
[08:46:37] <MOOhamHead> johnkpaul: yeah that doesn't work.  I need a string not an object
[08:47:03] <johnkpaul> .html() returns a string, not an object
[08:47:32] <johnkpaul> ?eval $("<div><img src='test'></div>").html()
[08:47:33] <bot-t> johnkpaul: TypeError: div is undefined
[08:47:56] <johnkpaul> hm, can't do that with bot-t
[08:48:06] <carloescobar> _archer_:  Doesn't seem to help either
[08:48:57] <carloescobar> Shouldn't matter where I load it, right?
[08:49:07] <scar> when using a google map iframe inside of a jquery dialog, it shifts the iframe position-- how can i reset this?

[08:51:09] <carloescobar> I need a blank div first though
[08:53:10] <_archer_> carloescobar - okay.  Ignore the function then.  The code I've given you shows you how to handle the click event
[08:53:14] <_archer_> That does work
[08:53:21] <carloescobar> Ok, thanks
[08:53:31] <carloescobar> I'm looking at it
[08:54:42] <carloescobar> Hm
[08:54:46] <carloescobar> I mean, it should work
[08:54:49] <carloescobar> works in the fiddle
[08:56:24] <carloescobar> It's def. the website
[08:58:07] <_archer_> Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK $(element).on("click.mynamespace", functionName) will never work, because click.mynamespace is not an event name
[08:58:30] <_archer_> If you've got a fiddle where that works then I'd really be interested in seeing it
[08:59:59] <_archer_> I take it back - I just tried it on the last fiddle I sent you and it does work.  Okay - I'll rephrase.  You don't need the .mynamespace - it's pointless
[09:00:04] <_archer_> That's better :p
[09:00:14] <carloescobar> hehe
[09:00:36] <carloescobar> but yeah, strange
[09:00:53] <jenia> hello everyone.

[09:01:22] <jenia> that causes "DOM exception 12" to be triggered
[09:01:43] <jenia> so what i should do then is to inform the broswer the version of html to use?
[09:03:46] <Jon47> jquery doesn't insert ids and class names
[09:04:13] <_archer_> carloescobar - I can't really help as I don't understand what you're trying to do.  I thought it was just a toggle, which I gave you code for, but you said you need a blank div first.  Without context, I can't understand it
[09:04:39] <jenia> well, when i create a widget, it insert the html into the page
[09:05:10] <jenia> that html, i think, causes my browser to issue exception back to the jquery code calling it
[09:05:22] <jenia> so im inside a catch block
[09:05:24] <carloescobar> point is there should first be 1 div showing, then a second when I press the button. The first one should then hide forever. Press the button again and a third div should appear but the second should be hid. Then rotate between those two for each press of the button.
[09:05:40] <jenia> and the caught eception is: DOMException
[09:05:45] <jenia> code 12
[09:05:52] <NoiseEee> CODE 12 RUN
[09:06:03] <jenia> SYNTAC ERROR, DOM exception 12
[09:06:34] <NoiseEee> jenia: whatever/whoever is generating the "-" in IDs, change it.  it's not jquery.
[09:06:50] <carloescobar> _archer_:  Does it make sense when you see the rest of the site?
[09:07:04] <jenia> okay thanks
[09:08:03] <_archer_> carloescobar - okay, I can make it do that in an example fiddle
[09:08:10] <carloescobar> Me too
[09:08:27] <carloescobar> now I actually got a little bit further
[09:08:52] <carloescobar> now it shows the second div, but doesn't respond any more to clicks after that
[09:08:59] <carloescobar> www.caks.no/nht
[09:11:09] <_archer_> carloescobar - look at this http://jsfiddle.net/HkWbX/1/
[09:11:24] <carloescobar> Perfect
[09:11:27] <carloescobar> I'll try that
[09:13:04] <carloescobar> nope
[09:13:06] <carloescobar> back at nothing
[09:14:40] <carloescobar> Doesn't make sense, does it?
[09:17:01] <carloescobar> Oh man
[09:17:03] <carloescobar> Got it!
[09:17:14] <carloescobar> had to remove the a before #id
[09:17:25] <carloescobar> But it works!
[09:17:30] <carloescobar> Thanks for your help man
[09:24:16] <kryl> hi, is it possible to wait that image are loaded before to start a jquery function ?
[09:24:40] <_archer_> carloescobar - no problem.  Glad to help :)
[09:24:46] <carloescobar> :)
[09:25:42] <shoky> kryl: $(window).load(function() {   ...  })
[09:26:33] <kryl> thx ;)
[09:29:47] <jenia> NoiseEee: tell me please, why are you saying that jquery does not generate id with "-" in them?
[09:30:14] <jenia> in my class i have class="ui-datepicker-inline..."
[09:30:25] <NoiseEee> right on.
[09:30:28] <jenia> in my html page, i have*
[09:30:37] <NoiseEee> a) that's jquery ui;   b) that's a class
[09:31:00] <jenia> yea a class. but i mean class or id. sorry
[09:31:38] <jenia> can you tell me, how to specify to my to use the new html specification to avoid the dom exception 12 error
[09:31:40] <jenia> ?
[09:31:50] <jenia> how to specify to my browser*
[09:32:16] <shoky> what browser?
[09:32:27] <jenia> firefox and chromium
[09:32:39] <shoky> they deal with "-" fine in class names..
[09:32:40] <NoiseEee> jenia: http://diveintohtml5.info/introduction.html
[09:32:47] <shesek> anyone known what does "Just Works (tm)" means? where does it come from?
[09:32:54] <NoiseEee> she's confused about classes, id's and what is actually generating her ids.
[09:32:58] <NoiseEee> but good luck jen
[09:32:59] <NoiseEee> ia
[09:33:17] <shoky> shesek what do you mean, what does it mean?
[09:34:47] <shoky> k nvm
[09:35:02] <shesek> shoky, its used in regular sentences with the TM, mostly in programming-related discussion... such as "It Just Works (TM) in PHP, but requires more effort in blah blah blah"
[09:35:20] <shesek> !g site:github.com inurl:issues "just works tm"
[09:35:41] <shesek> I see it all over the place... I always wondered what it meant
[09:36:34] <shoky> shesek "it just works" is just a common phrase and also used in marketing a lot (it was apple's slogan for smth)
[09:37:19] <shysoft> I'm attempting the dialog example here: "http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/" but the dialog looks incorrect. There's no color or graphics, just text with a hyperlinked 'close' where the 'x' should be. What's wrong?
[09:37:35] <shesek> ah, so the (tm) is used as a reference to Apple using it as a slogan?
[09:37:52] <shoky> the TM=trademark is just a tongue-in-cheek thing
[09:38:01] <shoky> supposed to be humorous
[09:38:19] <shesek> yeah, I realized that... but still wondered why people do that
[09:38:35] <ngharo> shysoft: include the jQUI stylesheet
[09:38:40] <shoky> they think its funny i guess
[09:38:54] <shesek> well, cool, thanks
[09:39:15] <shoky> ;p
[09:39:17] <ngharo> far too many sh*'s in here right now
[09:39:18] <shoky> did you win 2k?
[09:39:19] <ngharo> :)
[09:42:28] <jenia> when im creating a date_picker jquery add a div with this id: "ui-datepicker-div". i think that this id causes me problems.
[09:42:41] <jenia> i read on jquery that its added after the first datepicker element is initialized
[09:42:57] <shoky> jenia yes jquery UI's class names have "-" in them
[09:43:08] <jenia> no, its an id
[09:43:09] <shoky> browsers are fine with it, your problem is probably caused by something else
[09:43:27] <jenia> id="ui-datepicker-div"
[09:44:54] <jenia> this is a tiny paste and its all the code that i have
[09:44:56] <jenia> http://pastebin.com/B8n5jN9S
[09:45:06] <DerekPioneer> i'm trying to do a hoverzoom on thumbnails, only problem is that i'm doing $('div').hoverzoom(), and all of the examples i'm seeing they're doing $('div img').hoverzoom();
[09:45:16] <DerekPioneer> if there's not something in the div, it looks like it collapses all the divs next to each otehr
[09:45:18] <DerekPioneer> http://jsfiddle.net/5gJD5/
[09:45:29] <DerekPioneer> i have four divs with a background-color
[09:45:47] <DerekPioneer> hoverpulse() makes them all collapse on each other because they don't have an img inside the div, what can i do?
[09:47:23] <jenia> if someone can check it, that would be really helpful
[09:48:02] <shoky> jenia: i dont see it making an id for any div
[09:48:09] <shoky> jenia: http://jsfiddle.net/MdHZH/
[09:48:48] <shoky> jenia: also, "-" is fine in id also..
[09:49:21] <jenia> hehe. thanks. somethig is wrong. maybe the themeroller files that i downloaded... maybe there something wrong there
[09:50:38] <shoky> i doubt a css file would cause that :\
[09:51:46] <jenia> aight. thanks shoky
[09:52:45] <Whirl3d__> Hey all, I am not sure why I am having such a hard time with this, but here is some _heavily_ commented code written to simply facilitate a slideup footer panel with tabs...http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/9vJXF/
[09:53:27] <ryanneufeld> I am excite
[09:53:42] <ryanneufeld> jQuery conf SF this year again!
[09:56:40] <fromRus> wow
[10:00:57] <Whirl3d__> I'm sure my problem is really simple basic mistake..and I can watcht the console claim to be doing the right thing..I just don't see the contents of the footer panel for some reason.
[10:01:09] <fromRus> d
[10:01:29] <fromRus> hallo
[10:01:38] <shoky> Whirl3d__ i'm lookin through it, already seen 2 small mistakes
[10:01:55] <fromRus> can you  hear me
[10:02:00] <shoky> yes
[10:02:09] <Whirl3d__> Sure we can...what's up?
[10:02:35] <fromRus> this is truth they want to bomb you
[10:02:43] <fromRus> Putin and Co
[10:02:44] <shoky> Whirl3d__, you got </ul> instead of </div>.  and $('.footerContents') instead of $('.footerContent')
[10:03:01] <_archer_> fromRus - shut your arse
[10:03:32] <fromRus> im from the best country
[10:04:05] <_archer_> fromRus - I'm the only one in here that responds to trolling, and I'm leaving.  Bye :D
[10:04:06] <ryanneufeld> ./ignore fromRus
[10:04:54] <fromRus> americans sheet
[10:06:03] <poppiez> any way to tell if the window gets focused?
[10:06:31] <fromRus> its pitsburgh
[10:06:35] <Whirl3d__> how you can catch details like that, I'll never know. I could spend hours on it and never see that. Shoky you are amazing.
[10:06:40] <fromRus> ?
[10:07:42] <fromRus> from moscaw
[10:08:11] <shoky> Whirl3d__ i just dont go on to the next line until im sure everything up till now is ok
[10:08:32] <shoky> also the </ul> was easy cause jsfiddle highlited it :P
[10:09:02] <Whirl3d__> wait, It didn't highlight it for me... where'd you see that?
[10:09:35] <shoky> it shows in red
[10:09:38] <shoky> when i load your fiddle
[10:09:56] <rhizmoe> that's what she said
[10:11:01] <Whirl3d__> see, I never trust that because it updates "dynamically" when I am typing---but not accurately. So often, there will be red pieces that just magically disappear when fsfiddle gets around to it.
[10:12:01] <Whirl3d__> like I just added back the </ul> error and it turned the </div> after it red. I delete the </ul> and the </div> stays red... kinda hard to trust it.
[10:15:17] <shoky> yeah i dont trust it either. but it did make it easy to spot for me just now ;p
[10:15:47] <jrockjiggz> Hi, when i load my ajax in using a fragment, or by narrowing my html by data.html('#el'). the <script> js inside that element won't execute
[10:16:00] <shoky> Whirl3d__ is the bottom:-100%  just to keep it out of view?
[10:16:12] <shoky> ah no i guess its for sliding up
[10:16:19] <jrockjiggz> Why would a ajax fragment not fire js?
[10:17:33] <Whirl3d__> originally I thought I would keep it fully expanded out of view to avoid the re-flow of content that can happen with height based animations.
[10:21:08] <shoky> Whirl3d__: you're calling showFooterContents twice
[10:23:08] <shoky> first in setTab
[10:23:27] <shoky> and then right after returning from setTab
[10:25:28] <Whirl3d__> another good catch. when it wasn't working, I added the call in setTab to be sure.
[10:27:09] <Crimlo> hi, anyone around?
[10:27:16] <kryl> I want to click on different part of an image, what's the best method to apply ? map ?
[10:27:21] <blacksoul> Hey, is it some how possible to get 2 divs.tabs() of jquery UI next to each other (like floating)? when i try this with two divs adding float:left/right to them, it doesnt work - somebody an idea?
[10:27:37] <Whirl3d__> and the entire idea behind returning  the deferred promises was so that i didn't have to constantly check the status of the panel. If it was active, the deferred would be resolved so it would just skip the animation
[10:27:53] <Whirl3d__> but then I got scared and stopped relying on that.
[10:29:35] <blacksoul> kryl: without javascript, yes
[10:30:51] <shoky> Whirl3d__ and another $('.footerContents') heh
[10:31:02] <Crimlo> no matter what i cannot understand jquery
[10:31:22] <silverwind> Crimlo, then change job :/
[10:31:40] <shoky> Whirl3d__: http://jsfiddle.net/9vJXF/7/
[10:31:43] <silverwind> Crimlo, if you have a question... just ask
[10:32:23] <dougb> is it possible to scan through the DOM and run through all of the images that aren't in a div or an element that is display:none?
[10:32:38] <QueueQueue> Crimlo, once you get a grasp of the base concepts learning jQuery comes together quite nicely.
[10:32:55] <blacksoul> *points to my question*, silverwind  :)
[10:33:22] <silverwind> blacksoul, I have no knowledge of jQueryUI
[10:33:29] <silverwind> Only jQuery, sorry
[10:33:38] <blacksoul> silverwind: thanks, no problem :)
[10:34:03] <shoky> blacksoul it doesnt sound like a good idea to actually float them
[10:34:10] <Whirl3d__> shoky, still showing all the text from all the tabs for some reason...
[10:34:25] <RonWhoCares> I am needing more help.  Someone showed me a solution that works @ http://jsfiddle.net/s4r7p/1/  But when I implemented it at http://www.theverseoftheday.info/Bible-knowledge-phrase-solver/ it doesn't work.  Is there something obvious I am missing?
[10:34:26] <shoky> Whirl3d__ yeapp
[10:34:48] <blacksoul> shoky: yes, besides it doesnt work; each tab geht full width
[10:35:00] <shoky> Whirl3d__:  :D
[10:35:05] <shoky> Whirl3d__:  display: "none"
[10:35:38] <kryl> blacksoul, and is there javascript equivalent ?
[10:35:41] <shoky> er now no text is showing heh http://jsfiddle.net/9vJXF/8/
[10:36:28] <MeXTuX> I'm appeding rows to a table with $('#myTable').append(). The appended row has a column and that column has a link class 'myLink'. I want to bind added click to a function myFunction( ). Used $(document).ready() to bind all .myLink elements to the function but when i click on the new link nothing happens. So how can I bind dynamically added links click event to a function?
[10:36:29] <blacksoul> kryl: there is no need for javascript, except that you can built your own function getting the mouse position via jquery ui and parsing it
[10:37:08] <kryl> sure
[10:37:32] <blacksoul> use map, plain html is always better, kryl
[10:38:20] <shoky> Whirl3d__: also  top:0, left:0  in css ;p
[10:39:45] <Whirl3d__> lol 'px' huh?
[10:40:11] <shoky> no, the comma :P
[10:40:32] <Crimlo> Queue trust me brother i've tried, just not getting anywhere...
[10:41:45] <blacksoul> Crimlo: so where do you stuck?
[10:42:06] <Crimlo> at the beginning brother
[10:42:32] <QueueQueue> The best place to start is really getting an understanding of what jQuery selectors are and how they work.
[10:42:35] <blacksoul> okay, so turning on the computer by pressing the - normally - round button
[10:42:50] <Crimlo> selectors?
[10:42:53] <shoky> Whirl3d__: after your comment  //make sure the active tab is not hidden to calc height
[10:43:11] <ryanneufeld> ?g css selectors @Crimlo
[10:43:11] <shoky> Whirl3d__: you're setting the activeContents opacity to 0, so .. no show ;p
[10:43:11] <bot-t> Crimlo, Selectors - http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html
[10:43:23] <ryanneufeld> ?g jquery selectors @Crimlo
[10:43:24] <bot-t> Crimlo, Selectors  jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[10:43:41] <Crimlo> ok let me read up a bit and i'll be back with a question or two
[10:43:44] <Crimlo> thanks guys
[10:44:20] <RonWhoCares> Could someone look at my question
[10:45:00] <RonWhoCares> I was given the help @ http://jsfiddle.net/s4r7p/1/   But when I implemented it the effect didn't work (on the letter 'A') @ http://www.theverseoftheday.info/Bible-knowledge-phrase-solver/
[10:45:45] <dgs> this is probably a silly question, but . . . is the data set/got via the $(x).data('blah') method different to the data stored via a <div data-blah="blah"> attribute? (or should the jquery data() call be able to retrieve both sorts?
[10:46:06] <ryanneufeld> RonWhoCares: looks like it's working here
[10:46:18] <RonWhoCares> on my web site?
[10:46:39] <KolakCC> RonWhoCares: You don't have jquery loaded.
[10:46:43] <ryanneufeld> RonWhoCares: have you checked your console
[10:46:45] <ryanneufeld> ?
[10:47:09] <ryanneufeld> the error is staring me in the face
[10:47:25] <ryanneufeld> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined keyboard_letter_selection_effect.js:1

[10:51:09] <RonWhoCares> what does that error mean
[10:51:10] <Crimlo> really?

[10:57:58] <Danwe_WMDE> is it bad style to return a jQuery.Promise when knowing that it will never be triggered?
[10:58:15] <Danwe_WMDE> Assuming i have a stopSomething() function which returns a Promise, should it also return a Promise when called when "Something" is not running or would it be nicer to return false in that situation?
[11:03:27] <shoky> Danwe_WMDE: if you don't care that the caller might set a done callback that'll never get called, and if the caller doesn't care when there's nothing to actually stop, i'd say its fine to return the promise
[11:04:02] <shoky> Danwe_WMDE: but personally i'd prolly return false, although it really depends how you're gonna use it
[11:04:22] <Danwe_WMDE> shoky: one was concerned about the waste of resources involved but I think they can be pretty much ignored.
[11:05:13] <Danwe_WMDE> there is also a isRunning() function. I don't like checking for false each time using the stopSomething()
[11:05:21] <shoky> it's a bit more overhead, sure..
[11:05:48] <lsterling> I just want to publicly thank Whirl3D for being awesome and helping me via PM with a problem that I wasted 8 hours on because I'm an idiot. That is all. Good day!
[11:06:32] <shoky> Danwe_WMDE: ok so return the promise.. then i'd prolly prefer to resolve it anyway though
[11:07:01] <shoky> or mayyybe reject if it could be considered an erroneous state
[11:07:03] <Kogsworth> ^_^ that's cause Whirl3d__ is awesome
[11:07:08] <shoky> ^^
[11:07:24] <Danwe_WMDE> shoky: good thought, that's a good question whether it should actually be triggered then or not...
[11:08:35] <Danwe_WMDE> What I usually do is adding additional info to the Promise like Promise.isStopping when the thing was called before and didn't finish yet in which case the same promise will be returned. So there could be a Promise.wasRunning added which can then be used if necessary
[11:11:05] <shoky> i'd prefer to pass data/flag arguments when resolving/rejecting
[11:12:06] <shoky> like..  if (notRunning) dfd.resolve({status: 'wasStopped'})  or whatever
[11:12:53] <shoky> and if i care, check those in the callback
[11:12:55] <Danwe_WMDE> shoky: I think that's two completely different things ;) The thing I do is basically as information immediatelly after and related to the actual return
[11:13:19] <Danwe_WMDE> based on these you actually might not want to register for any callback at all
[11:13:51] <shoky> gotcha
[11:13:52] <Danwe_WMDE> but then again, perhaps its not that different....
[11:14:08] <Danwe_WMDE> you could still do that by adding controlstructures into the callback
[11:14:22] <shoky> if you want to avoid registering callbacks... maybe you need something else then ;p
[11:14:57] <shoky> but maybe adding properties to the promise ain't too bad, i dunno
[11:16:29] <GhostBear> Is there any way to track which element was source for new item for sortable?
[11:17:01] <GhostBear> I'm using connectToSortable option in draggable to create new elements for sotable
[11:17:44] <GhostBear> Or is there any kind of event on new element creation?
[11:20:33] <Danwe_WMDE> thanks for the ideas shoky, I'll reflect on that
[11:23:17] <GhostBear> Oh well, it was recieve
[11:23:32] <GhostBear> The problem is that ui.sender and ui.item are the same element, source element
[11:26:34] <EyePulp> is $('#some_checkbox').is(":checked")  considered the "right/best" way to query the checked status of a form element?
[11:27:17] <GhostBear> Any help please? Is there any way I can get handle of cloned element when I drag element from draggable to sortable?
[11:27:27] <ryanneufeld> GhostBear: I think Ihave some code that can help you
[11:27:33] <ryanneufeld> sec, I'm checking my fiddles
[11:27:51] <_trev> EyePulp, That's how I'd check
[11:27:57] <GhostBear> it seems that sortable recieve event has handles to source element only
[11:28:03] <ryanneufeld> GhostBear: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[11:28:16] <ryanneufeld> I ended up storing a reference to it in the beforeStop
[11:28:45] <GhostBear> Thanks, looking into it
[11:28:56] <ryanneufeld> hmm, it did work... seems it's failing now
[11:29:38] <mkeil> Hi! I got a strange behavior of the .change() event. i have a textbox with the .change() and an div with .click() when i now enter a value into the textbox and directly after that click the button only the .change() will fire and i don't find a way to recognize in the code that the change was triggered by the button.
[11:30:06] <ryanneufeld> GhostBear: there, updated the jquery versions, should work okay now
[11:30:07] <NoiseEee> mkeil: events are triggered by people, not programming
[11:30:17] <ryanneufeld> NoiseEee: not true
[11:30:31] <ryanneufeld> ?trigger @ NoiseEee
[11:30:31] <bot-t> NoiseEee, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[11:30:42] <NoiseEee> ryanneufeld: right, i meant without specifically requesting so
[11:31:00] <NoiseEee> ryanneufeld: he was wondering why the event didnt happen au natural
[11:31:15] <dodgerdog> Hey everyone, I'm a bit new to jQuery and need a little bit of help.
[11:31:22] <mkeil> NoiseEee, thats not the point. when i click on the button only change fires. but the button also has an click() defined. so i assume to see that change() and click() get's triggered
[11:31:32] <dodgerdog> I am trying to grab the HtmlTableRowElement object from a table.
[11:31:40] <dodgerdog> Here is my jsFiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/vJ48J/
[11:32:03] <dodgerdog> I can only grab [object Object], is there a way that I can get [object HtmlTableRowElement]?
[11:32:18] <ryanneufeld> dodgerdog: see ?console
[11:32:18] <bot-t> dodgerdog, Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
[11:32:38] <ryanneufeld> test will be a jquery object
[11:33:09] <NoiseEee> mkeil: http://jsfiddle.net/CqhrN/
[11:33:24] <dodgerdog> ryanneufeld: How can I access the HtmlTableRowElement Object specifically?
[11:34:00] <ryanneufeld> For starters look here, this will help
[11:34:01] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/vJ48J/2/
[11:34:30] <ryanneufeld> dodgerdog: also, by grabbing .parent() your asking for the table
[11:34:37] <ryanneufeld> the selector alone will give you the row
[11:34:51] <Eviltwin> (tbody)
[11:35:09] <ryanneufeld> dodgerdog: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/vJ48J/3/
[11:35:31] <mkeil> NoiseEee, hmm strange. maybe i have to really register the click() through jquery. currently it's just an onclick=""
[11:35:33] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: yeah, tbody, right. either way his was incorrect
[11:35:57] <ryanneufeld> mkeil: wouldn't hurt
[11:36:16] <dodgerdog> ryanneufeld: You're the man, thank you so much!
[11:36:27] <ryanneufeld> But I'm a girl
[11:36:38] <ryanneufeld> j/k I'm not a girl
[11:36:56] <ryanneufeld> but there are a few in here. And a few of them are really good at this :)
[11:38:22] <dodgerdog> Word, thanks. :)
[11:38:41] <ryanneufeld> np
[11:39:23] <someprimetime> how can i write this so that I don't have to keep writing var $listElement = $(this)?
[11:39:24] <someprimetime> http://pastebin.com/Q4wdNfA9
[11:39:47] <ryanneufeld> someprimetime: instead of doing that
[11:39:50] <ryanneufeld> just use this
[11:39:51] <someprimetime> like can I wrap that in something else?
[11:40:18] <Eviltwin> cloneOverlay($(this)) or simply cloneOverlay(this) and have cloneOverlay expect a DOM element
[11:40:53] <someprimetime> ok sick
[11:40:58] <someprimetime> thanks guys
[11:40:58] <shoky> or .hover(cloneOverlay, removeCloneOverlay).click(fetchProductInfo)
[11:41:12] <ryanneufeld>             $('.js-carousel-product-info').hover(cloneOverlay, removeCloneOverlay, fetchProductInfo);
[11:41:13] <someprimetime> nice thanks all
[11:41:15] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:41:18] <Eviltwin> (Assuming you change the functions to work with "this" instead of their first argumente)
[11:41:20] <ryanneufeld> that is best bro
[11:41:25] <Eviltwin> For shoky and ryanneufeld's solutions
[11:41:32] <shoky> aye
[11:41:36] <someprimetime> bad ass thanks
[11:41:42] <ryanneufeld> yup
[11:47:44] <jstout24> anyone know of a plugin i can look at that does something like, http://o7.no/N5gTjp
[11:48:05] <jstout24> i don't think it's "chosen" either
[11:50:33] <shoky> jstout24: jquery multiselect
[11:51:28] <jstout24> nice, thanks
[11:51:29] <jstout24> :)
[11:52:29] <jyg> when creating the markup for jquery ui tabs, what's the patter?  I'm looking at the examples, but nothing explains how the plugin diciphers he markup... is it the #id's?  is it a div with a ul and and a set of analagous divs in side? i'm just not sure what I have to do and what I can customize
[11:52:37] <jyg> er, pattern
[11:52:40] <shoky> and select2 also has smth for multiple-selects but it's a different UI
[11:53:27] <aro> is there a way to hoverintent outside an element?
[11:54:45] <shoky> jyg <div> <ul> <li><a href="#mytab">bla</a></li> </ul> <div id="mytab">div content</div> </div>
[11:55:11] <shoky> jyg it's the id's, yes
[11:55:17] <shoky> id's and href's
[11:55:48] <jyg> ah, thanks
[11:56:43] <jyg> do the mytab divs have to share a parent with the ul?
[11:56:51] <jyg> or can they be elsewhere in the dom?
[11:57:05] <shoky> they need to share, i believe
[11:57:06] <jyg> i.e. its purely the href+id combo that connects them
[11:57:08] <jyg> hmm ok
[11:58:16] <jyg> mm and they have to be siblings with the ul it seems
[11:58:32] <shoky> yes, it needs to be the same structure as in the docs/examples
[11:58:39] <jyg> i'm using backbone and dust to render the tab panes inside a div that's a sibling of the ul
[11:58:41] <shoky> don't stray from it
[11:58:46] <jyg> yep.. and it breaks
[11:59:40] <shoky> donno backbone sry.. with knockout there are custom bindings for jqui stuff
[12:04:34] <jyg> is there a way thanks for the insights, shoky
[12:04:40] <jyg> er heh
[12:04:41] <jyg> one more time
[12:04:44] <jyg> thanks for the insights, shoky
[12:04:58] <gnarf> jyg: can you repeat the issue?
[12:05:23] <gnarf> tabs is #hash = an ID of the element
[12:05:24] <jyg> gnarf, its not really an issue, its an incompatability
[12:05:53] <gnarf> i believe it needs a "ul a" for the links, but that selector is configurable (from memory)
[12:05:54] <jyg> i was asking how the tabs and content panels are related asnd how strict the markup needs to be
[12:06:21] <gnarf> jyg: i believe tabs also has an "add" method that you can add a new tab with if you are dynamically generating it
[12:06:48] <jyg> right, thanks gnarf
[12:06:59] <gnarf> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[12:07:07] <ForSpareParts> Quick question: If I register a click event to a div containing a link and click the link, how can I retrieve the containing div's ID? I tried $(event.target).parent(), but that gets me nothing...
[12:07:23] <gnarf> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs#method-add
[12:08:18] <gnarf> jyg: also, you could easily write a "uuid" style function to force a unique ID on the tab content
[12:10:11] <gnarf> ForSpareParts: so if the click event is bound to the div
[12:10:13] <gnarf> this.id
[12:10:47] <gnarf> ForSpareParts: otherwise $( event.target ).closest( ".someSelector" ).attr( "id" )
[12:11:00] <gnarf> ?closest
[12:11:00] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:11:04] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/cLXep/ - can someone help me do those cool tag thingies like StackOverflow?

[12:12:51] <ForSpareParts> gnarf, Ah, thanks. I was doing something really stupid.

[12:15:24] <mikkelb> ryanneufeld: I don't think so?
[12:15:47] <mikkelb> ryanneufeld: Like a file input except slicker I guess

[12:16:39] <aro> is there a way to hoverintent outside an element?
[12:16:53] <aro> like hoverintent on mouseout

[12:17:41] <mikkelb> You don't have permission to access / on this server.
[12:17:50] <mikkelb> ryanneufeld: why are u showing me sites that dont work, girl?
[12:19:52] <MOOhamHead> .html() is supposed to return a string but backbone_view.$el.html($(errors_tmpl)).html()) doesnt
[12:20:13] <MOOhamHead> nor does backbone_view.$el.html();
[12:20:15] <Wiz_KeeD> hey guys
[12:20:38] <aro> hai
[12:20:43] <MOOhamHead> nor does backbone_view.$el.html('<valid html section>').html()) doesnt
[12:21:43] <Wiz_KeeD> hey guys, how do i make an animation of a text that looks typed live?
[12:22:27] <jyg> hrm... your text as an array of characters
[12:22:40] <jyg> append one char at a time to a container with a delay
[12:23:01] <upmauro> where i find one plugin for baloon notigy similar msn messenger notify (bottom in right)
[12:23:08] <jyg> maybe put in a < 250 msec randomized delay
[12:23:23] <Wiz_KeeD> firebug says delay is not a functio but all the subsequent calls at jquery work
[12:24:33] <RohanBhangui> have some li elements that have same class
[12:24:40] <RohanBhangui> is there anyway
[12:24:49] <RohanBhangui> by which if i click on one then the others will get aniamted
[12:24:58] <jyg> yep
[12:25:12] <jyg> just use that class you mentioned... ?
[12:25:28] <jyg> you mean all others except the clicked on?
[12:25:29] <jyg> one
[12:25:44] <mikkelb> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[12:26:00] <mikkelb> http://stonesthrowpodcast.com/stonesthrow_74_karriem.mp3
[12:28:26] <RohanBhangui> yes
[12:32:20] <jyg> Weird, detach() returns the selected elements, but doesn't actually detach them.  When I appendTo() with the elements returned from the detach() call, it *copies* them  O.o
[12:33:21] <jyg> too bad jquery doesn't have a .move()
[12:34:08] <batterhead> jyg: coming in late... what would it do?
[12:34:30] <jyg> making moving elements simple? :)
[12:34:49] <jyg> though i'd rather know why, atm, detach copies rather than detaches
[12:36:07] <jyg> odd remove() is not removing , i've tested the selector though... weird
[12:38:03] <upmauro> where i find one plugin for baloon notigy similar msn messenger notify (bottom in right)
[12:38:07] <upmauro> please sugest
[12:40:25] <gnarf> jyg: um
[12:40:32] <gnarf> jyg: elements can only exist in one place in the dom
[12:40:39] <gnarf> if you append it somewhere else, it is "moved"
[12:43:13] <batterhead> jyg: just made a little fiddle and it works for me with 1.7
[12:43:33] <upmauro> jquery-toastmessage-plugin
[12:43:35] <upmauro> thanks !

[12:43:48] <rodd> $(".bottom_wide").attr("style","margin-top:"+dif+"px");
[12:43:55] <rodd> how can they do that
[12:45:49] <batterhead> jyg: http://jsfiddle.net/NgGYj/3/
[12:46:01] <gnarf> rodd: why not .css({ marginTop: dif })
[12:46:26] <rodd> gnarf: I know, this is just some stuff people do here at work
[12:46:47] <gnarf> rodd: git blame - then find who did it, and ridicule them in the commit log
[12:53:57] <toughguyhlve> Best jQuery Minifier Anybody?

[12:56:36] <_trev> uglify js is good.
[13:32:57] <mikkelb> Hey hey
[13:32:59] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/6ET8U/3/ I'm trying to do an "Attach a file" like in Gmail - but how do I write some jQuery to call click() on the input element when the link gets clicked?
[13:38:19] <Koganei> so, say i have a toggle event bound to a div, is there a way to know which of the two functions is gonna be called next?
[13:38:33] <Koganei> which of the two functions of the toggle event that is
[13:40:05] <raj> how can i get a div to stick to the top of page when it reaches that position?
[13:40:19] <BFranks> I have some jQuery on a page that requires a re-load to get right.. every single time.. Almost like the elements don't load in order, but on the re-load they are still cached so it works?!
[13:42:05] <Koganei> BFranks: are you puttin your jquery around a $(document).ready(function() {    }) ?
[13:42:31] <BFranks> Koganei: yeah
[13:42:46] <shoky> raj: you need to listen for scroll events, check the element's position/scrolltop, if it's at the top of the viewport then change it to position:fixed
[13:43:40] <shoky> i.e. no easy shortcut, just hack it out ;p
[13:43:53] <Koganei> BFranks: fiddle?
[13:43:59] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery sticky scroll @ raj
[13:44:00] <bot-t> raj, jQuery Sticky Scroller / Position:Fixed Plugin - http://www.vertstudios.com/blog/jquery-sticky-scroller-position-fixed-plugin/
[13:44:12] <johnkpaul> there are many plugins, I even have one on my github page
[13:45:18] <BFranks> Koganei: I can try to make a fiddle.. It's on a WP blog in preview mode so it's hard to share
[13:45:54] <Koganei> oh i see
[13:46:43] <Koganei> I don't know how jquery plays with WP
[13:49:00] <BFranks> Koganei: Not very well from the looks of it.. My fiddle (other than a warning to reload if it looks normal) is working fine, nothing odd.. http://jsfiddle.net/yzP7M/1/   ..
[13:50:00] <BFranks> Since I don't have a flood of 12yr olds telling me this isn't the #WP channel, let me go ask a jQuery question over there..  ;P
[13:50:30] <Koganei> yeah, I dunno, sorry
[13:52:10] <diamonds> so jquery has a "paste" event
[13:52:24] <diamonds> is there a way to access the buffer being pasted or intercept it?
[13:52:31] <track0x1> since i can't solve this problem with css, i figured maybe there is a way to do this with jquery... http://beuteiful.com/wip/test2.htm
[13:52:35] <imanc> does anyone know if there's an underscore specific chan?
[13:52:53] <BFranks> Diamonds: Ask yourself how much you'd love it if random websites could steal your copy buffer or insert something into it?
[13:53:13] <diamonds> BFranks: when I hit ^V ?
[13:53:20] <diamonds> they are welcome to steal my buffer ;)
[13:53:53] <BFranks> Diamonds: the only web tech I know of  that allows tapping into the copy buffer on the client is 'Flash' .. :)
[13:54:03] <diamonds> hmm...
[13:54:16] <diamonds> I'm not trying to "tap into" their clipboard
[13:54:20] <BFranks> Diamonds: What if you just copied some username/password info.. clicked the wrong page link, and they copied it?
[13:54:40] <diamonds> BFranks: what are you talking about?!?!
[13:54:51] <BFranks> Diamonds: Copy/Paste ?
[13:54:53] <BFranks> :)
[13:55:11] <Eightamrock> There is a copy event you can grab
[13:55:15] <diamonds> when they attempt to paste to a contenteditable element (thereby giving me the contents of the clipboard) I want to INTERCEPT it before it gets into the elem
[13:55:18] <Eightamrock> and get the data copied while on page
[13:55:34] <diamonds> there is no security concern here
[13:55:38] <shoky> diamonds: the only way to get it is to check the contents of the elem (AFTER it gets into it)
[13:55:45] <raj> johnkpaul-afk, you have jquery sticky scroller on your github page?
[13:55:48] <diamonds> shoky: kk
[13:55:56] <diamonds> I was hoping against hope...
[13:56:49] <tudda> You guys are talking about two different things.
[13:57:12] <diamonds> 1. user hits control V
[13:57:27] <tudda> One is talking about accessing the clients clipboard / copy buffer at will. the other is talking about capturing the paste event and checking the incoming data PRIOR to it being pasted
[13:57:31] <diamonds> 3. content is inserted into contenteditable elem
[13:57:42] <diamonds> 2. ?? where is the paste text now? can I get at it?
[13:57:46] <shoky> tudda: we're talking about the latter
[13:57:52] <diamonds> ^
[13:58:25] <NoiseEee> diamonds: no, you cannot get at it
[13:58:25] <tudda> I was referring to bfranks comments above, not you shoky :)
[13:58:28] <raj> wutup shoky
[13:58:37] <diamonds> ty NoiseEee
[13:58:39] <shoky> raj nothin ;S sups
[13:58:46] <raj> hacking
[13:58:55] <diamonds> window.secret.incomingPasteBuffer
[13:58:58] <johnkpaul> raj: yes
[13:58:59] <shoky> lawl
[13:59:05] <diamonds> is it in the event??
[13:59:22] <tudda> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/686995/jquery-catch-paste-input
[13:59:46] <shoky> yes, he gets it after its already in the element
[13:59:55] <shoky> with a timeout
[14:00:31] <tudda> You could grab the existing value, pull the pasted value, run your code, and then either keep or restore it based on whatever
[14:00:36] <diamonds> yeah, that's what I figured I'd need to do
[14:00:51] <diamonds> I need to diff the two now, cuz I wish to sanitize only the pasted bit
[14:01:29] <BFranks> Huzzah! If you have a Wordpress install with jQuery 'enqueued' within the functions.php (apparently this was recommended?) then if you also call it via <script> tags in the post it's only going to load every other time.. for some reason (?) .. that's what was causing my issues with requiring a page reload
[14:02:41] <raj> johnkpaul, seems very un-jqueryish with the way it's instantiated
[14:02:43] <diamonds> huh... this guy shunts the paste off to another element, created ad hoc
[14:03:01] <johnkpaul> raj: feel free to fork and fix
[14:03:19] <raj> don't think I'm good enough to do that
[14:03:55] <shoky> diamonds: what guy
[14:04:13] <diamonds> shoky: http://stackoverflow.com/a/688682/146406
[14:04:43] <Koganei> BFranks: that's super weird
[14:05:08] <diamonds> is paste really a jquery method?
[14:05:29] <diamonds> furthermore, I don't see him preventDefault'ing, so presumably it was pasted twice (?)
[14:05:43] <shoky> diamonds no its a DOM event
[14:06:51] <shoky> diamonds i dont understand what he is doing there
[14:06:58] <diamonds> yeah I'm kind of confused too
[14:07:12] <diamonds> well he's changing the focus, thereby redirecting the paste to another elem
[14:07:26] <shoky> not really
[14:07:30] <diamonds> oh?
[14:07:37] <shoky> did you try it?
[14:07:42] <diamonds> working on it now
[14:07:46] <BFranks> Koganei: Yeah I didn't get far on the #wordpress channel before remembering someone mentioning there were tweaks to the functions.php file for the WP theme.. 5th line was a jquery enqueue and tossing it into a comment was all it took to fix me up.. :p
[14:07:51] <diamonds> shoky: why, works it not?
[14:08:04] <shoky> changing the focus happens AFTER the paste..
[14:08:05] <BFranks> Some days are luckier than others..
[14:08:16] <someprimetime> ajpiano: yo
[14:08:23] <someprimetime> you know anyone who has an extra jquery ticket i can purchase from?
[14:08:34] <someprimetime> or 2 by chance?
[14:08:52] <shoky> diamonds: anyway $(this).paste  doesn't exist
[14:09:02] <diamonds> yeah I was wondering about that
[14:09:35] <diamonds> I am selling tickets that entitle you to an unlimited number of jQueries
[14:12:23] <raj> johnkpaul, what was your reason for forking?
[14:12:35] <raj> to provide unittesting?
[14:12:55] <diamonds> is there a reliable way to extract the string I just pasted from an elem?
[14:12:59] <johnkpaul> raj: I didn't fork that, I wrote that
[14:13:03] <johnkpaul> I was telling you to fork it
[14:13:05] <raj> oh shit
[14:13:07] <raj> haha
[14:13:08] <raj> nice
[14:13:23] <diamonds> strpos or its equiv. wouldn't work if they pasted twice
[14:13:31] <diamonds> ugh I don't want to mess with range & selection
[14:14:02] <diamonds> so I have "abcdefgh" then they paste and I have "abcd123defgh"
[14:14:07] <raj> oh, well, I def won't know my head from my ass in making it work like $('#someelement').stickyscroll()
[14:14:12] <diamonds> how can I extract that 123?
[14:14:40] <diamonds> hmmm... go thru char by char and see if it's different, then slice to the end of the difference in length
[14:16:58] <diamonds> sweet, strings can be treated as arrays :p
[14:19:42] <RohanBhangui> they are arrays
[14:19:45] <RohanBhangui> think about it
[14:19:50] <RohanBhangui> a string is an array of chracters
[14:19:57] <RohanBhangui> *characters
[14:31:03] <macmartine> When dropping an item using 'helper: original', when the original one gets destroyed jQuery throws an error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'options' of undefined". It's coming from the 'stop' callback in the source. Is there a way to preventDefault on that or something so it doesn't get called?
[14:48:53] <theEric> Dumb question that I should know, but I'm having a brain fart and can't figure this out - Assuming the markup <li><a><ul><li><a> if the first LI is what is being examined , how do you use FIND to determine the first A before the sibling UL?
[14:49:41] <Dr-Bombay> that UL isn't a sibling, it's a child
[14:50:09] <Dr-Bombay> hmm
[14:50:51] <theEric> The first A and UL are siblings. I didn't use end-tags to designate this.
[14:51:13] <Eviltwin> Dr-Bombay: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.2.2
[14:51:23] <Eviltwin> theEric: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.2.2
[14:51:56] <Dr-Bombay> try  .nextUntil('ul', 'a')
[14:52:35] <theEric> Eviltwin: Note my comment above about end-tags.
[14:52:57] <Eviltwin> The reason we have end tags is so as not to be ambiguous about the structure...
[14:54:09] <theEric> Thats quaint.
[14:54:54] <Eviltwin> You're right, it's better if the browser has to take a wild guess
[14:55:19] <Dr-Bombay> PHP does it so why can't browsers
[14:56:47] <Dr-Bombay> theEric: seriously who can answer the question if you don't make the hierarchy clear
[15:00:54] <theEric> I didn't imagine figuring out the above markup would be that complicated to figure out. <li><a></a><ul><li><a></a></li></ul></li>
[15:04:37] <Kronuz> in jquery, if I use some.find() is there a way to get some in the same line again? (like "going up" a level?)
[15:04:53] <Eviltwin> see ?.end()
[15:04:54] <bot-t> .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[15:04:57] <Kronuz> mmm
[15:06:13] <Kronuz> thank you Eviltwin! :D
[15:10:55] <ngharo> I don't have much international experience ... is there a method to check if user is 12 hour or 24 hour time format?
[15:21:19] <RohanBhangui> say i have an animation
[15:21:29] <RohanBhangui> and want to reverse that animation
[15:21:41] <RohanBhangui> but want to not naimate a div that i click
[15:21:46] <RohanBhangui> any ways of doing that
[15:21:50] <someprimetime> animate({'left', '-100px'}, 'slow');
[15:21:55] <someprimetime> animate({'left', '100px'}, 'slow');
[15:21:56] <someprimetime> ?
[15:22:11] <RohanBhangui> say i click a button
[15:22:19] <RohanBhangui> it reveals 4 divs labeled abcd
[15:22:25] <RohanBhangui> *a, b, c, d
[15:22:32] <RohanBhangui> and i click b
[15:22:50] <RohanBhangui> how can i hide a c d but keep b open
[15:23:00] <dmishe> hey, is there a way to somehow make my click handler fire _last_, no matter how many handlers are going to be attached to my element
[15:24:48] <RohanBhangui> any help?
[15:24:53] <RohanBhangui> someprimetime?
[15:26:04] <johnkpaul> dmishe: ideally, you'd fix your code to remove that reuqirement, but you _could_ setTimeout(handler,0)
[15:26:19] <dmishe> johnkpaul thanks
[15:26:20] <mdiamond> is there any decent way to attach data to an event as it propagates up the handler chain?
[15:26:37] <mdiamond> my use case is that I'm tracking click events with a document-level handler
[15:26:44] <mdiamond> but I'm also attaching the current location.hash
[15:26:59] <mdiamond> however my app has a menu that listens for click events and modifies the hash in its handler
[15:27:10] <mdiamond> so I want to grab and report those click events with the current page hash before the modification takes place
[15:27:18] <mdiamond> but then the click event will eventually bubble up to my document-level handler and report twice
[15:27:25] <mdiamond> I was thinking of just stopping propagation at the menu
[15:27:39] <mdiamond> but that seems a bit dangerous in case other things are listening to document clicks
[15:27:57] <mdiamond> so I'd like to be able to add some kind of data to the event to signal to my document-level handler that the event has already been reported
[15:28:03] <mdiamond> can't think of a good way to do this
[15:31:23] <johnkpaul> mdiamond: I'm pretty sure that it's the same event object that is passed to every handler
[15:31:27] <johnkpaul> but you should check me on that
[15:31:45] <mdiamond> yeah I did a quick test and attaching properties to the event object didn't work for catching them in other handlers
[15:32:04] <mdiamond> or at least it didn't seem to
[15:32:50] <johnkpaul> macmartine: http://jsfiddle.net/6fXXF/
[15:32:53] <johnkpaul> it does work
[15:32:58] <johnkpaul> well, at least in that case
[15:33:17] <macmartine> johnkpaul: ?
[15:33:29] <johnkpaul> did you click on that jsfiddle
[15:33:45] <macmartine> johnkpaul: i think you've got the wrong guy
[15:33:54] <johnkpaul> ha sorry!
[15:33:55] <johnkpaul> mdiamond:
[15:34:09] <mdiamond> yeah just saw
[15:34:10] <mdiamond> hmm
[15:34:18] <mdiamond> weird though, I wasn't seeing it working in my code
[15:34:20] <mdiamond> I'll try again
[15:34:39] <mdiamond> could it be cause they were bound to the same element?
[15:34:54] <mdiamond> I'd be interested in passing messages upward via event bubbling
[15:35:40] <yakko> hey guys, I wanna do something to <img> when the user scrolls down the page and finally sees it, is there a js event for it? (I have gone thru event guides before asking here)
[15:35:49] <mdiamond> oh wait
[15:35:52] <mdiamond> I was testing it the wrong way
[15:35:52] <mdiamond> yes
[15:35:59] <mdiamond> johnkpaul: I think that will work
[15:36:01] <mdiamond> johnkpaul: thanks
[15:36:20] <johnkpaul> mdiamond: no problem
[15:37:57] <Eviltwin> yakko: What you'd need to do is look at the .offset() of the image compared to the .scrollTop() of the window and the window.height()
[15:38:09] <Eviltwin> There's no event for something moving into the visible space of the page
[15:38:25] <yakko> =/
[15:38:37] <Eviltwin> But you know it can't happen without a scroll event happening
[15:38:52] <yakko> on the window scroll event?
[15:38:58] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:39:06] <yakko> :(
[15:39:17] <Eviltwin> We didn't make the browsers
[15:39:20] <yakko> I wish I could have the images hidden
[15:39:39] <yakko> so when they scroll, they run a show('slow')
[15:40:18] <yakko> should it work or having the image hidden causes them not to download the image?
[15:40:53] <Eviltwin> Depends on the browser and how it's hidden
[15:42:19] <abjorn> :O
[15:54:40] <Afflicto> How can I check if an element is empty? (contains nothing)
[16:00:33] <mdiamond> hey, who was helping me earlier with that event propagation thing
[16:01:40] <mdiamond> oops
[16:01:47] <mdiamond> anyway I'm trying to figure out if you can attach data to events as they propagate
[16:02:03] <mdiamond> this would suggest that you can't: http://jsfiddle.net/dUWWX/
[16:03:52] <mdiamond> http://jsfiddle.net/dUWWX/5/
[16:03:54] <mdiamond> sorry, that's the one
[16:03:56] <ryanneufeld> mdiamond: yeah, cause you're doing it wrong
[16:04:06] <mdiamond> ryanneufeld: what's the proper way
[16:04:27] <ryanneufeld> start by understanding what the function is that you're passing to .click
[16:04:31] <ryanneufeld> and what the parameters are
[16:04:51] <mdiamond> I'm just trying to persist data on the event object as it bubbles up the DOM
[16:04:56] <mdiamond> so that something that binds it at a lower, more specific level
[16:05:02] <mdiamond> can indicate that it already performed some sort of task
[16:05:09] <mdiamond> and that any document level handlers
[16:05:10] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/dUWWX/6/
[16:05:12] <mdiamond> can read that information
[16:05:37] <mdiamond> yes, your example proves my point
[16:05:40] <mdiamond> you can't attach data to the event
[16:05:45] <mdiamond> e.bar does not exist in the console log
[16:05:46] <ryanneufeld> mdiamond: you know you can attach data to the element itself using see ?.data()
[16:05:47] <bot-t> mdiamond, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[16:05:59] <mdiamond> yes I can attach data to the e.target
[16:06:06] <mdiamond> that seems kind of hacky though for my purposes
[16:06:13] <ryanneufeld> No, my example proves that you don't understand how events work
[16:06:33] <ryanneufeld> the event object doesn't exist until the event happens
[16:06:37] <mdiamond> I understand that
[16:06:48] <ryanneufeld> then it dies at the end of the callback's function scope
[16:06:48] <mdiamond> but shouldn't the same event object be passed to all the handlers?
[16:06:52] <ryanneufeld> No
[16:06:53] <mdiamond> oh I see
[16:06:56] <ryanneufeld> no no no
[16:06:58] <mdiamond> well someone earlier gave me that impression
[16:07:00] <ryanneufeld> that would be terrible
[16:07:07] <ryanneufeld> there is always one passed
[16:07:07] <mdiamond> alright
[16:07:16] <ryanneufeld> but it's one for *that* unique event
[16:07:37] <mdiamond> okay so when it bubbles up to the document layer it becomes a completely new event
[16:08:23] <ryanneufeld> also, binding on document.click()
[16:08:25] <ryanneufeld> bad idea
[16:08:36] <ryanneufeld> unless you're trying to catch every single click a user does
[16:08:55] <mdiamond> that's what I'm trying to do
[16:08:56] <mdiamond> it's for analytics
[16:09:07] <ryanneufeld> o
[16:09:31] <mdiamond> but I'm also trying to capture data at a lower level before hashchanges occur so I can report the original hash
[16:09:40] <mdiamond> I was hoping I could attach data to the bubbling event to indicate that it had already been processed
[16:09:44] <mdiamond> so the document-level handler could ignore it
[16:09:46] <mdiamond> but it seems that is not possible
[16:09:49] <mdiamond> that's all I'm trying to ascertain
[16:10:07] <mdiamond> and no I don't want to stopPropagation
[16:10:07] <ryanneufeld> well, document click would let you do that
[16:10:31] <mdiamond> yeah but hashchanges occur in click handlers on certain menu elements in my app
[16:10:39] <mdiamond> so I want to report that click event early
[16:10:41] <mdiamond> it's a special case
[16:10:43] <mdiamond> that's why it's tricky
[16:10:49] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/dUWWX/7/
[16:10:52] <ryanneufeld> that's one way
[16:10:55] <ryanneufeld> to pass the data
[16:10:56] <ryanneufeld> BUT
[16:10:59] <ryanneufeld> you can do this too
[16:11:40] <m1d0_> I want to consistently fire an event when a page first loads its images. what should I be using?
[16:12:02] <Eviltwin> m1d0_: $(window).load?
[16:12:06] <m1d0_> A common challenge developers attempt to solve using the .load() shortcut is to execute a function when an image (or collection of images) have completely loaded. There are several known caveats with this that should be noted. These are: It doesn't work consistently nor reliably cross-browser. It doesn't fire correctly in WebKit if the image src is set to the same src as before.  It doesn't correctly bubble up the DOM tree.  Can cease to fire for 
[16:12:15] <ryanneufeld> mdiamond: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/dUWWX/8/
[16:12:18] <RohanBhangui> quick question
[16:12:20] <m1d0_> is that still the case? :0
[16:12:21] <mdiamond> ryanneufeld: yes I mentioned using data on the target element also
[16:12:25] <RohanBhangui> is tehre anyway one could take a value
[16:12:27] <mdiamond> but I don't really like that solution
[16:12:29] <RohanBhangui> that is in css
[16:12:31] <RohanBhangui> eg
[16:12:35] <RohanBhangui> left: 40%;
[16:12:52] <mdiamond> ryanneufeld: yeah I guess I can ignore it that way
[16:12:57] <RohanBhangui> convert that to px to use in jquery and then out put that percentage to px again
[16:13:07] <ryanneufeld> mdiamond: it's the same as what you were trying to do, only it works
[16:13:28] <mdiamond> well it's not exactly the same
[16:13:36] <mdiamond> it requires me to know ahead of time what elements to blacklist
[16:13:38] <Eviltwin> m1d0_: "The load event fires at the end of the document loading process. At this point, all of the objects in the document are in the DOM, and all the images and sub-frames have finished loading."
[16:13:39] <mdiamond> but yes it's workable
[16:14:00] <ryanneufeld> mdiamond: using $(e.target).data() to get the data
[16:14:08] <mdiamond> yeah but that involves the DOM
[16:14:10] <m1d0_> yeah, but it says it's inconsistent on the next line. i had never heard that before.. was just checking. i've never had issues with it
[16:14:10] <mdiamond> I can do it
[16:14:15] <mdiamond> it just doesn't seem as clean as attaching to the event
[16:14:21] <mdiamond> since it's really data about the event, not about the dom
[16:14:23] <mdiamond> but yes, that would work
[16:14:40] <ryanneufeld> the events are about the DOM
[16:14:44] <ryanneufeld> it's all about the DOM
[16:15:26] <ryanneufeld> mdiamond: the only other solution would be a global array/object that housed the information you're asking for
[16:16:14] <mdiamond> ryanneufeld: look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/dUWWX/11/
[16:16:24] <m1d0_> thanks Eviltwin :)
[16:16:31] <mdiamond> event objects CAN persist data when the events are triggered from within jQuery
[16:16:38] <ryanneufeld> stop using alerts
[16:16:42] <ryanneufeld> learn how to use the console.
[16:16:46] <mdiamond> I know how to use the console
[16:17:09] <ryanneufeld> then use it
[16:17:14] <mdiamond> nah
[16:17:14] <ryanneufeld> alerts are a terrible thing
[16:17:26] <mdiamond> I'm sorry you were scarred as a child by an alert-related trauma
[16:17:29] <mdiamond> but I feel like using them
[16:17:33] <mdiamond> and I don't appreciate your condescending tone
[16:17:37] <mdiamond> I'll just figure this out myself then
[16:17:38] <LordThumper> It's a proof of concept, who cares if its an alert
[16:17:44] <mdiamond> LordThumper: thank you
[16:17:48] <BFranks> LOL.. I started learning how to use the console.. but setting traps and trying to go ferret out the info was NOT as easy as using an alert.. ;p
[16:17:58] <mdiamond> BFranks: thank you also
[16:18:21] <ryanneufeld> mdiamond: Now I don't want to help your arrogant ass. Try debugging an ajax call using an alert... You're gonna have a bad time
[16:18:25] <ryanneufeld> alerts are blocking
[16:18:36] <mdiamond> ryanneufeld: yes but this isn't an ajax bug so I felt like using an alert
[16:18:46] <mdiamond> ryanneufeld: and I also proved you were wrong about events being able to persist data
[16:18:51] <mdiamond> ryanneufeld: so I think you're the arrogant one here
[16:18:58] <mdiamond> ryanneufeld: but this isn't worth my time
[16:19:00] <ryanneufeld> Good for you
[16:19:09] <BFranks> I think we're all arrogant..
[16:19:10] <ryanneufeld> I tried to help you, and now you're being a dick
[16:19:16] <ryanneufeld> do you feel good now?
[16:19:27] <mdiamond> ryanneufeld: yes, a little bit
[16:19:51] <BFranks> The only non arrogant ones are hanging out just to spectate and watch the fights.. but those c**cky buggers think they are above the squabbling..

I made some edits to make submenus appear on hover instead of click, and it's glitchy as hell,  but only randomly - you have to click around a bit before some of the menus start to stay open when they're not supposed to. I added some stop(true,true) and stopPropogation bits from my googling efforts, but the code is probably ugly and cau
[16:21:29] <lsterling> the glitches. Can anyone take a look?  http://jsfiddle.net/8aaBP/2/
[16:21:46] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ lsterling
[16:21:46] <bot-t> lsterling, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:21:51] <BFranks> ryan: We used rubber nails.. you'll be fine..
[16:21:55] <Eviltwin> lsterling: You've given us JavaScript
[16:22:00] <Eviltwin> We can't see anything working / not working
[16:22:15] <lsterling> I can provide a URL of the working example via PM. It's for a client site. I just wanted to ask first because I don't want to publicize it.
[16:22:15] <Eviltwin> Please try to make a demonstration of the problem
[16:22:36] <Eviltwin> We'd greatly prefer it if you could make a demo of the problem isolated in jsFiddle
[16:22:40] <Eviltwin> Rather that nested in a site
[16:23:23] <lsterling> Okay I thought since it was wordpress and the menus are created dynamically, that may be part of the problem. I'll create a dummy and hopefully that will be enough.
[16:23:59] <mdiamond> I think the takeaways from that squabble were: 1) saying "my example proves that you don't understand how events work" and "learn how to use the console" will tend to make you look condescending
[16:24:15] <mdiamond> and 2) events can persist attached data if triggered manually through jQuery

[16:40:12] <imsky> what are you bros talking about
[16:40:27] <Whirl3d_> so I have a function object that I want to extend with another object to give it a bunch of extra methods. No problems. Now, one of those methods grabs an element from the dom and binds a bunch of ?events? to it? or is it okay to say binds methods to it.?
[16:41:01] <coldhead> event handlers?
[16:41:13] <Whirl3d_> coldhead lives!
[16:41:30] <Whirl3d_> I thought they were gonna work you down to a nub...
[16:42:58] <Whirl3d_> event handlers it is...now my question is that if I say $(domelem).trigger("handlera"), I really want it to trigger my object function's method. How do I setup the binding to call the function from my object...  for example:
[16:43:27] <Whirl3d_> my object has the nextSlide method...I do $("elem").bind("nextSlide", ______)
[16:43:43] <Whirl3d_> can I just bind it directly to obj.nextSlide or do I need $.proxy
[16:44:09] <Eviltwin> Depends on if you use "this" in the function or not
[16:44:25] <Whirl3d_> and you would suggest...
[16:44:31] <Eviltwin> Or if you want access to the "elem" that the handler was bound to
[16:44:49] <coldhead> Eviltwin lives!
[16:44:56] <coldhead> everything is back to normal
[16:45:10] <Whirl3d_> I need to update button states on the "elem" if that helps.
[16:45:32] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Never here for long these days though :(

[16:47:04] <MrGando> Hey guys, I'm trying to call a function when I click a button using onclick="my_js_function()" , the problem is that the function is in $(document).ready(function(){ ... so clicking the button gives me a is 'my_js_function is not defined' , how could I solve this ?
[16:47:23] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: Having a little trouble following your request. Can you make a quick jsFiddle mockup of your situation?
[16:47:46] <Eviltwin> MrGando: It's better to use see ?.on
[16:47:48] <bot-t> MrGando, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:47:52] <Eviltwin> If you can
[16:47:57] <Whirl3d_> I'll try. If it's too much of a mess. don't spend a lot of time on it and just point me in the right direction, please....
[16:48:08] <Eviltwin> Use JavaScript to attach the event listener to the elements
[16:48:48] <Eviltwin> $("#myid").on("click", functionName); for example
[16:49:01] <Eviltwin> Or use the shortcut: $("#myid").click(functionName);
[16:49:35] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: I'm saying a little mock
[16:49:39] <Eviltwin> Not your whole thing
[16:49:49] <Eviltwin> Like an example of how you're constructing a function object
[16:49:55] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5zLBy/
[16:50:06] <Whirl3d_> just ignore the individual methods...
[16:50:12] <Whirl3d_> they could be anything
[16:50:28] <Whirl3d_> its' just the last 5 lines that I am getting confused about
[16:50:53] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/tKBtr/11/
[16:50:54] <Whirl3d_> maybe last 7 lines...the constructor function and the extend function
[16:50:59] <RohanBhangui> anyone willing to help
[16:51:36] <coldhead> Eviltwin: we'll take what we can get! nice to see you here at all!
[16:51:57] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: Okay, one thing that jumps out is the selectors like $(".galleryContent.active") in your methods
[16:52:00] <Whirl3d_> amen!
[16:52:10] <Eviltwin> The global selectors
[16:52:25] <Eviltwin> Meaning if you tried to put two of these on the same page
[16:52:30] <Eviltwin> They wouldn't play nicely with each other
[16:52:57] <Whirl3d_> sure. I figured I would work that out later. LOL but I don't know how to store the instance reference...
[16:53:30] <Whirl3d_> I havent figured out where "this" means the gallery object and when it means the fundtion and when it means the document
[16:54:41] <draginx> is there a way to listen for any kind of html change?
[16:55:07] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: Here's an example of a class built via prototype: http://jsfiddle.net/qjKD2/
[16:55:16] <Eviltwin> draginx: Not a good way, no
[16:55:36] <draginx> Eviltwin: $('tr.ship_state_row').trigger('states_loaded'); I have that and then I added a triggerHandler('states_loaded'
[16:55:42] <draginx> but it didn't execute, any idea why?
[16:55:55] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ draginx
[16:55:55] <bot-t> draginx, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:56:11] <spiderworm> has anyone seen jquery create <:section> elements rather than <section> in IE in some situations?
[16:56:19] <Eviltwin> spiderworm: Nope
[16:57:24] <Whirl3d_> Eviltwin, thank you for the model. I will rework my code using that as an example and start from there. Unfortunately, I have to leave for an hour or so suddely. grrr.
[16:57:45] <Whirl3d_> Still thanks for your help and coldhead good so see you alive and kckin..
[16:58:56] <coldhead> thanks, Whirl3d-Out, it's good to still be alive
[17:00:56] <Koganei> is there a straightforward way  to loop around say $('.box') and for the first loop get all the .boxes then the second all but the first, then the third loop all but the first two, etc. ?
[17:02:04] <Eviltwin> var boxes = $('.box'); for(var j = 0; j < boxes.length; j++) { for(var i = j; i < boxes.length; i++) { ... } }
[17:02:21] <Eviltwin> Access boxes[i]
[17:02:23] <Koganei> oh hey that's pretty
[17:02:34] <Eviltwin> This is Programming 101 :P
[17:02:36] <Koganei> cool thanks
[17:02:38] <Koganei> yeah

[17:06:52] <Afflicto> Can someone tell me what's wrong with this simple script? trying to remove elements. http://pastebin.com/BKBVySg9
[17:08:16] <Eviltwin> Between lines 2 and 3 do var $this = $(this)
[17:08:28] <Eviltwin> Then change line 3 to use $this.html() instead of $(this).html()
[17:08:39] <Eviltwin> And line 7 from $(this).remove() to $this.remove()
[17:08:49] <Afflicto> ok.. what does that do though? the dollar sign?
[17:09:03] <abjorn> imsky: oonce oonce oonce oonce oonce
[17:09:03] <Afflicto> I did try putting it in a var. var element = $(this). but that didn't work.
[17:09:10] <LordThumper> Your this is getting overriden
[17:09:13] <imsky> abjorn, techno baby?
[17:09:25] <Afflicto> oh ok
[17:09:30] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/tKBtr/11/ need help
[17:09:51] <RohanBhangui> positioning for my items whe nyou click rohan
[17:09:58] <RohanBhangui> dont come out right
[17:10:53] <Afflicto> Eviltwin: ok now it works for the second element but not the first one. I konw the first one is length = 0,
[17:10:56] <Eviltwin> RohanBhangui: It'd help if you explained what the right positioning is
[17:10:58] <abjorn> imsky: just kinda felt like it
[17:11:05] <abjorn> watchin south park
[17:11:10] <imsky> abjorn, word up my wegro
[17:11:11] <RohanBhangui> oh okay
[17:11:36] <RohanBhangui> what is suppose to hapen is when you click the rohan button the items should fan out
[17:11:44] <RohanBhangui> ill make a screen shot
[17:12:31] <tw2113> RohanBhangui it looks like it's dependent on the browser width
[17:12:45] <tw2113> so that says to me that you need a wrapping container with a set width
[17:12:49] <RohanBhangui> i need the items to be dependant on the browser size too
[17:12:52] <tw2113> and probably margin: 0 auto
[17:12:55] <RohanBhangui> or better eyt dpendant on rohan
[17:13:04] <Eviltwin> Afflicto: Can you use alert or console.log and make sure the strlength is atually < 1?
[17:13:05] <tw2113> then you'll want a wrapper around all of it
[17:13:35] <imsky> abjorn, can you think of a build tool for html files?
[17:13:57] <abjorn> uhh
[17:14:01] <abjorn> grunt?
[17:14:05] <imsky> lol
[17:14:08] <abjorn> any kind of
[17:14:09] <Afflicto> Eviltwin: I have done that. it is 0 both times.
[17:14:10] <abjorn> scripted build system
[17:14:13] <abjorn> apache ant
[17:14:15] <abjorn> etc
[17:14:21] <imsky> thanks for the help >:|
[17:14:27] <Eviltwin> Afflicto: Show a paste of the new code
[17:14:32] <Afflicto> k
[17:14:37] <abjorn> WELL SHIT DAWG be more specific
[17:14:42] <imsky> hmm i guess
[17:14:53] <imsky> something that converts some dom nodes to specific text
[17:14:53] <Afflicto> http://pastebin.com/kxLgPw0V
[17:15:02] <imsky> not dom to dom but literal text replacement
[17:15:09] <Eviltwin> The "var" keyword exists for a reason
[17:15:12] <Eviltwin> Use it
[17:15:42] <Eviltwin> In front of line 3
[17:15:44] <Afflicto> oh
[17:15:46] <Eviltwin> line 4*
[17:15:46] <abjorn> hm, idk of anything that does that specifically, but you could just try a regex replace, unless you need something more flexible or something. idk imsky
[17:15:46] <Afflicto> of course :P
[17:16:02] <Afflicto> yay! it works. thanks a lot <3
[17:16:05] <abjorn> could use grunt and use the node dom thingy to parse it
[17:16:06] <imsky> abjorn, that's what i'm doing, was wondering if you knew of anything less 2004
[17:16:42] <tw2113> another thing RohanBhangui you can't use the ID of main more than 1 time

[17:20:49] <RohanBhangui> i can t get it to do it on differnet screne sizes
[17:25:13] <imsky> abjorn, that's what i'm doing, was wondering if you knew of anything less 2004
[17:25:19] <imsky> errrr

[17:26:53] <tw2113> RohanBhangui try this http://jsfiddle.net/tw2113/tKBtr/14/
[17:27:10] <tw2113> bah
[17:27:29] <tw2113> keeps moving on me a bit
[17:27:46] <RohanBhangui> ya the facebook element is like under the rohan element
[17:28:09] <aamax> hi all I have a form and need to detect if any of the controls on it have changed and prompt the user to save if they try to leave the form (close the browser, refresh, forward, back, click a link etc)  I saw the FormObserve JQuery plugin and it looks promising but i'm new to JQuery and wondered if any of you have used it before?
[17:29:26] <aamax> are there better ways you'd recommend to check for elements being changed than what I'm proposing?
[17:29:39] <tw2113> try this one RohanBhangui http://jsfiddle.net/tKBtr/16/
[17:29:52] <coldhead> that looks ideal, aamax
[17:30:02] <Eviltwin> imsky: It'd probably be pretty easy to build something with Python's xml.etree.ElementTree.XMLParser
[17:30:20] <imsky> Eviltwin, could be, but i'm not about to install python
[17:30:28] <coldhead> you could roll your own quite simply that binds to the 'change' event for each input and compares current values with original values
[17:30:29] <tw2113> you'll want to work on your code for when someone clicks them away and then re-clicks to bring them back
[17:30:38] <coldhead> but then the hard work on the plugin will go to waste
[17:30:41] <Eviltwin> imsky: Something against Python?
[17:30:44] <coldhead> why wouldn't you just use it, aamax ?
[17:30:48] <RohanBhangui> tw2113
[17:30:55] <RohanBhangui> you mean when the reverse aniamtion occurs
[17:31:03] <imsky> Eviltwin, yes
[17:31:26] <tw2113> when it reverses to take them out
[17:31:28] <aamax> coldhead, so I added the $('#panel_dialog_form').FormObserve(); line to the query and tested it using the color style change and it is working nicely.  I'm not sure how to use it to tell if the user has changed anything in the onbeforeunload event (which is where I"m trying to test).
[17:31:32] <tw2113> then they click a 3rd time and they come back in
[17:31:36] <aamax> like i said, i'm new to this stuff :)
[17:31:38] <tw2113> keeps showing up REALLY far right
[17:32:23] <aamax> an the onbeforeunload event seems to behave oddly.  alert's don't show up for one thing...
[17:32:33] <abjorn> lol imsky way2go
[17:32:35] <abjorn> COLDHEAD WHATS UP
[17:33:04] <RohanBhangui> ya  tw2113 i dont knwo why that is happening
[17:33:14] <RohanBhangui> it didnt happen when i used pixels
[17:33:29] <RohanBhangui> is there anyway by which i can convert the percentage in css
[17:33:34] <coldhead> hey abjsy
[17:33:36] <RohanBhangui> to px for my ps code to read
[17:33:46] <RohanBhangui> and then out put that asa px value again
[17:33:49] <raj> shoky, did you check out Suits?
[17:33:56] <coldhead> aamax: onbeforeunload is weird
[17:34:04] <coldhead> i can't see the source to this code
[17:34:05] <RohanBhangui> raj: hes asleep
[17:34:16] <aamax> coldhead, agreed.
[17:34:31] <coldhead> aamax: if the plugin were any good it would let you provide a function to run when there are unsaved changes
[17:34:38] <coldhead> if it doesn't you may need to add it yourself
[17:34:46] <coldhead> OR try the roll your own
[17:35:17] <aamax> I'm trying to avoid setting a variable in every single control etc on the page.  that would be ugly
[17:35:21] <raj> thanks RohanBhangui
[17:35:33] <RohanBhangui> np
[17:36:10] <coldhead> aamax: hold tight, i'll prototype you a thing i guess
[17:36:57] <danheberden> coldhead this is jQuery support, not prototype
[17:37:06] <danheberden> so how about you get with the fucking program
[17:37:11] <imsky> oh lol
[17:37:25] <aamax> right on. thx.  I've been learning a lot over the past couple weeks but there's a lot of holes in the KB.
[17:37:25] <danheberden> also, i love you and you haven't called and i worry about you
[17:37:32] <aamax> danheberden, bite me :)
[17:37:52] <danheberden> aamax did i offend you?
[17:38:08] <aamax> not really. just giving back LOL
[17:38:35] <danheberden> also, why are there holes in your KeyBoard?
[17:38:51] <aamax> KB = knowledge base
[17:39:30] <danheberden> i understand now
[17:42:07] <coldhead> aamax: http://jsfiddle.net/hr2zR/
[17:42:10] <coldhead> no one else look at that
[17:43:33] <danheberden> ... coldhead
[17:43:42] <coldhead> >_>
[17:43:56] <danheberden> YOU'RE MISSING SOME CURLY BRACES
[17:43:59] <abjorn> aids aids aids
[17:44:06] <coldhead> oh god and i used semis
[17:44:10] <coldhead> i am so bad at this
[17:44:16] <abjorn> >implying semis are bad
[17:44:21] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[17:44:21] <danheberden> no semis are good baby
[17:44:34] <coldhead> i don't even know what to do to be cool
[17:44:40] <abjorn> all semicolons all the time, amirite imsky?
[17:44:53] <imsky> asi is for wimps
[17:44:55] <danheberden> coldhead well mustaches are cool, and curly braces kinda look like mustaches
[17:45:02] <danheberden> that's my rule of thumb, anyway
[17:45:06] <danheberden> err... rule of mustaches
[17:45:11] <coldhead> when i reach puberty i will look into that
[17:45:32] <thursday> I wear a fez now, fez's are cool
[17:45:46] <danheberden> i like this thursday person already
[17:45:54] <danheberden> i bet he wears a a bow-tie too
[17:46:01] <aamax> thx cold head.  quick question (followup) in the input selector, does that catch all of the controls on the page (select, text, check box etc)?
[17:46:18] <abjorn> I can't see the word fez without hearing "I SAID GOOD DAY" in my head
[17:47:19] <aamax> thanks 4 taking the time to do that.  very cool.
[17:50:59] <aamax> coldhead, I think that gets me close except the onbeforeunload event isn't behaving nicely
[17:52:14] <JonathanNeal> If there were such a thing as a querySelector that looked up the tree instead of down the tree, what would you call it? ancestorQuerySelector? upQuerySelector?  Also, would you ever expect it to match itself?
[17:53:20] <coldhead> aamax: that's what the $(':input') selector catches
[17:53:23] <coldhead> all input types
[17:53:32] <coldhead> i love you, jQuery
[17:53:42] <aamax> that's what I was thinking.  thx.
[17:53:57] <coldhead> aamax: i don't know enough about onbeforeunload to gues what problem you're seeing
[17:54:05] <coldhead> can you update the jsfiddle with your code?
[17:55:02] <danheberden> JonathanNeal: there has been talk of a parent selector in the newer css drafts, ya?
[17:55:19] <danheberden> which would still give it the label "querySelector"
[17:55:27] <danheberden> from an api standpoint
[17:55:34] <tw2113> RohanBhangui just ask your issues in here, despite the fact that they're all CSS issues and not jQuery
[17:55:40] <tw2113> or try #css
[17:55:53] <JonathanNeal> danheberden: I haven't heard of this. Have a link?
[17:56:02] <danheberden> css issues cost an additional fee of ego stroking
[17:56:33] <aamax> hmmm. I put an alert in the code you gave me to signal when something changed (when that function is run) but it doesn't get hit when i change the select boxes or other elements.  <scratches head>
[17:56:48] <danheberden> JonathanNeal: http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#subject
[17:56:52] <tw2113> JonathanNeal http://davidwalsh.name/css4-preview has an idea of it too
[17:57:13] <JonathanNeal> danheberden: I understand that querySelector is somewhat vague, as opposed to getElementsByQuery or something of that nature.
[17:57:28] <JonathanNeal> But I like the naming convention, or at least, I like that it's out there and somewhat standardized.
[17:57:43] <aamax> coldhead, i'll try to set up a jsfiddle.  the code is extensive and uses a bunch of rails partials etc. may take me a few to trim it down to the basics
[17:59:39] <JonathanNeal> danheberden: the $ syntax is cool, but doesn't necessarily translate to an upwards query selector.
[17:59:47] <JonathanNeal> containerQuerySelector?
[18:00:09] <danheberden> well jq uses 'closest', so maybe closestQuerySelector?
[18:00:25] <JonathanNeal> does closest only look up the chain?
[18:00:30] <tash> i'm not familiar with this syntax, $( "#id :input" ).val( "" );   I'm familar with what it does, but the whole :<thing> going on there, if I wanted to know what all I can do with :<thing> what would I look up? How's that for a weird question.
[18:01:04] <tash> I basically want to know if I can do something like $(" #id :select").val( "blah" );
[18:01:26] <coldhead> aamax: you can't just add the onbeforeunload bit?
[18:01:40] <aamax> i'm working on it. ;)
[18:01:46] <JonathanNeal> danheberden: I guess that's the best word if not only because of its usage in jQuery, but when I think "closest" I get all wary, like it will look for the closest one regardless of direction.
[18:02:34] <danheberden> aye
[18:02:44] <danheberden> whosmydaddyQuerySelector
[18:03:28] <JonathanNeal> that's why i had ancestorQuerySelector
[18:03:46] <Eviltwin> If I could redesign jQuery, I'd make the selector for .parent, .next, .prev work like .closest in the relevant direction
[18:03:53] <JonathanNeal> borrowing "ancestor" from commonAncestor in a Range object.
[18:03:56] <Eviltwin> It's much easier to just chain .filter(...) on the end
[18:05:34] <tw2113> btw hi JonathanNeal
[18:05:42] <JonathanNeal> hi tw2113
[18:05:43] <aamax> http://jsfiddle.net/aamax/8WYwX/3/
[18:05:57] <aamax> qualifier: I've never made a fiddle before...
[18:06:02] <JonathanNeal> I wonder why jQuery went with closest, like, if there's anything in javascript that pointed to that name.
[18:06:57] <aamax> i added some code in the submit event but truth is: I want this requirement to run when a user tries to leave a page without using submit.
[18:07:26] <aamax> you can see the confirm exit stuff too which is really what I"m interested in
[18:07:44] <JonathanNeal> Though, it's not like querySelector was related to anything in javascript previously either.  I wouldn't have been surprised if things like queryClassName, queryId, queryTagName had made it in too.
[18:07:55] <Eviltwin> aamax: Take a look at the left side of the jsFiddle
[18:08:02] <Eviltwin> Left of the HTML/JavaScript

[18:08:41] <RohanBhangui> but whe nyou press rohan again it doesnt go back in and goes all wonky
[18:08:48] <Eviltwin> So you don't have to reexplain every time
[18:09:03] <RohanBhangui> the problem is differnet this time but sure
[18:09:08] <JonathanNeal> I'll be back later. It's probably an unpopular discussion, but it interests me greatly.

[18:11:59] <Max-P> Hi, is it normal that when using Sortable and Draggable, both enter in conflict? (a couple of sortable lists and a source of draggable with connectToSortable set)
[18:12:48] <Max-P> ui.sender on my "receive" handler is pretty much random between the sortable it really comes from or the original source (not a sortable, just a regular div)

[18:15:15] <Max-P> tash: You can use .val() on it to reset it to the first option

[18:16:25] <raj> Eviltwin, where you been?
[18:17:10] <Max-P> tash: You need to use the "value" attribute of the <option> you want, I use it like that and it works fine
[18:17:56] <aamax> well.  I'm gonna step away from this for a while.  It's not working and is frustrating me :)  Thanks for the help.  I really appreciate it
[18:18:26] <coldhead> try to think of a non-onbeforeupload technique i guess
[18:18:51] <Max-P> Behi: Maybe you can try using regular JS, element.style['-webkit-transition'] = null or the webkit JS API for that property ?
[18:19:04] <tash> Max-P: I did what I mentioned and it worked.
[18:19:10] <tash> not sure why I didn't do that before
[18:19:11] <tash> sighs
[18:20:09] <Max-P> tash: Lol, happens ;) Typos happens too (I make a whole bunch of them and auto-complete completes the mess)
[18:20:54] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/tKBtr/17/
[18:20:56] <RohanBhangui> any help
[18:23:35] <Behi> @Max-P isn't working for me. I have a draggable that has some transition properties. If I use the clone helper, the dragging looks sluggish. So I have created my own clone function like this: https://gist.github.com/2957561 but still feels sluggish
[18:26:55] <cyphase> do i really only get 3 questions?
[18:27:00] <RohanBhangui> lol
[18:27:19] <coldhead> yes, you have 2 remaining
[18:27:21] <coldhead> good luck
[18:28:31] <imsky> coldhead, what's my name bitch
[18:28:54] <coldhead> marion zimmer bradley?
[18:28:58] <RohanBhangui> any one can help? http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/tKBtr/17/
[18:29:12] <imsky> wrong, it's mitton romney
[18:29:41] <Behi> @Max-P the strange thing is that I am not even changing a class triggering the animation, so I don't know why is it happening...
[18:30:04] <runvnc> RohanBhangui, http://jsfiddle.net/QFFnn/2/
[18:30:11] <runvnc> is not quite right but not as bad
[18:30:24] <runvnc> I took the left:50% off the #categories li
[18:30:25] <imsky> mitton gets down to the sultry sounds of shakira
[18:31:21] <raj> so position:fixed will keep an element stuck to the top of the viewport? I thought it was position:absolute?
[18:31:22] <abjorn> imsky's really been on a romney kick lately
[18:31:39] <imsky> i vote for the other guy every time
[18:31:41] <Max-P> Behi: jQuery adds a bunch of its classes while dragging, maybe one of them is the cause =/
[18:31:45] <raj> (like while scrolling, I'm creating a nav bar that will stay put at hte top of the view port when you scroll passed it
[18:31:50] <raj> )
[18:32:10] <griotspeak> Hello, I cannot get this jQuery UI demo working on my page. I can use jQuery to muck about with text, but tabs is a no go
[18:32:13] <griotspeak> https://gist.github.com/eaf3b871e1c7435c413b
[18:32:24] <griotspeak> funny thing is, draggable works just fine
[18:33:16] <raj> griotspeak, put it in a document.ready function
[18:33:29] <griotspeak> ah, i did that
[18:33:34] <griotspeak> sorry, didn't update the gist
[18:33:49] <Behi> @Max-P good point! I wonder if there's an API for disabling transitions on an element?
[18:34:11] <griotspeak> updated
[18:34:35] <Max-P> raj: position: absolutes places the element absolutely in the last position: relative container. You can experiment that with two nested divs. position: fixed is really sticked to the viewport
[18:35:22] <tash> I'd like to make sure that something that is entered in an input is numeric only ... and if not execute code.  I came across a stackoverflow that says something like this would work. But, I dont' understand the regexp if that is what it is. I am not very good at regexp: .match(/^\d+$/)
[18:35:29] <imsky> FEED MITTON
[18:35:38] <Max-P> Behi: Yes, it's .style['-webkit-transition-property'] I think. Tried $('.element').style['-webkit-transition-property'] = 'none'; &
[18:35:44] <raj> Max-P, isn't position:fixed the default position anyway?
[18:36:29] <Max-P> raj: No, it's "static".
[18:36:38] <Max-P> raj: http://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_positioning.asp
[18:36:48] <Whirl3d-Out> Mitton? Seriously? As in Mittens Ramney?
[18:36:59] <raj> oohhh, right
[18:36:59] <raj> static
[18:37:04] <Whirl3d-Out> *romney
[18:37:06] <raj> damn ok, then it all makes sense
[18:37:06] <raj> thanks
[18:37:16] <raj> Max-P, wait, so why isn't position:absolute appropriate?
[18:37:36] <Max-P> raj: You want a navbar that follows the scrolling of the page?
[18:37:54] <raj> Max-P, yes
[18:37:57] <abjorn> mittens ramney
[18:38:06] <abjorn> mittens ramnoy
[18:38:35] <Max-P> raj: Then it's position: fixed. position: absolute will be tied to the position:relative element, which will be <body> or any other element you placed as position: relative;
[18:39:25] <raj> oh, I see
[18:39:28] <raj> understood, thank you
[18:39:44] <imsky> mitton romaine
[18:39:45] <griotspeak> perhaps another angle. Is anything obviously wrong in this gist?
[18:39:50] <griotspeak> https://gist.github.com/eaf3b871e1c7435c413b
[18:40:08] <kah_> If I want to view this in readable syntax.. how could I do that?
[18:40:09] <kah_> https://gist.github.com/2957609
[18:40:17] <kah_> also is there a reason it's all in one line? does that get read faster?
[18:40:18] <griotspeak> Maybe I am doing something that precludes tags?
[18:40:34] <griotspeak> tabs. tabs. not tags
[18:40:57] <Whirl3d_> so when extending a function object using prototype-al inheritence, can you access the "private" variables defined in the scope of the original function?
[18:41:51] <Max-P> raj: Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/c6yaz/  it's a pretty obvious example of the power of position:relative and position:absolute ;)
[18:45:24] <imsky> abjorn, sometimes windows sucks. firefox can implement partial text matching in the address bar, but windows doesn't know what "nternet explorer" is

[18:48:54] <RohanBhangui> how to convert a css value that is in percentage to px
[18:49:42] <Whirl3d_> % = part/whole   so part=whole *%
[18:50:04] <lsterling> Does anyone know how to make an anchor link NOT go to the top of the window and instead like 50px from the top in IE7? Here's a working example using a :before pseudo class. http://jsfiddle.net/fvtY9/22/ But if you try it in IE7, no dice. I think I need a javascript solution to mimic this.
[18:51:16] <Whirl3d_> I would use the scrollTo plugin for jquery or ask #CSS
[18:52:27] <Behi> Max-P thanks i worked
[18:52:31] <Behi> *it
[18:52:39] <lsterling> I tried scrollTo, but it didn't scroll so I gave up assuming it was conflicting with something else I had going on. I'll revisit that. I don't think it can be done with CSS.
[18:53:23] <Whirl3d_> You might be surprised what all you can do with css. though IE7...not so sure. It's worth asking in #css
[18:53:51] <tw2113> you can do amazing things with IE7 too
[18:54:00] <tw2113> like download a good browser or update yourself to IE8
[18:54:30] <Max-P> ^ LOL
[18:54:46] <MistuhKurtz> lsterling, scrollTop
[18:54:47] <lsterling> yeah. if only my clients weren't still using it. sigh.
[18:55:00] <tw2113> you can do amazing things with that too lsterling
[18:55:05] <tw2113> like upgrade your clients
[18:55:13] <tw2113> and i don't mean you upgrade their browser
[18:55:17] <tw2113> i mean ditch them for better ones
[18:55:30] <MistuhKurtz> $(window).scrollTop('50px');
[18:55:43] <Max-P> lsterling: Can't you simply put the real anchor 50px higher so IE scrolls to 0px of the moved anchor?
[18:56:14] <MistuhKurtz> that works too Max-P
[18:57:16] <lsterling> I will try thank you.
[18:58:34] <MistuhKurtz> lsterling, so you don't want to go 50px from the top of the window, you want to scroll to 50px above the anchor?
[18:58:57] <lsterling> No I want 50px from top of window
[18:59:16] <lsterling> the jsfiddle is exactly what i want
[18:59:20] <lsterling> it just doesn't work in IE7.
[18:59:33] <MistuhKurtz> the jsfiddle scrolls to 50px above the link
[18:59:46] <cyphase> i have some text separated into spans with class snippet and an id identifying that particular snippet. currently as a placeholder i'm changing the background of the text to gray when hovering over each snippet. i want to be able to click a snippet, have it keep its background gray, and call a function which would receive the id as an argument so i can display information about that snippet
[18:59:48] <MistuhKurtz> or the anchor rather
[18:59:48] <cyphase> what's the best way to do this? i know i can add an onClick to each span, but is there a better way?
[19:00:00] <MistuhKurtz> not 50px from the top of the document
[19:00:35] <Ukto> if I have form id someForm, and I do a  $('#someForm').submit(function(zeepo) { zeepo.preventDefault(); $('#ActionBox').dialog({ (blahblah) }); $('#ActionBox').html($(this).closest('input').find('.textClassName').attr('value')); });    I cant seem to get the value of the text input with the class 'textClassName' (the only one in each form)
[19:00:46] <Max-P> lsterling: Ooops, my bad.
[19:00:52] <Ukto> I would use jfiddle to show, but its acting weird
[19:01:00] <MistuhKurtz> lsterling, http://jsfiddle.net/fvtY9/24/
[19:01:01] <lsterling> oh. right. sorry. yes I want it to appear 50px from the top of the window
[19:01:17] <Whirl3d_> anybody versed in deferreds?
[19:01:33] <MistuhKurtz> Just use padding-top on the wrapper element
[19:02:09] <lsterling> that doesn't work in IE7 either
[19:03:19] <Ukto> any suggestions on accessing the inputs value attribte? :)
[19:03:19] <MistuhKurtz> yes it does.
[19:03:20] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/fvtY9/25/
[19:03:38] <Whirl3d_> when checking the state of a Deferred object, you get resolved, rejected, or pending...what if the deferred was resolvedWith or rejectedWith? and if you pass data with the original deferred,resolve(data) and later try deferred.done(), the done callback fires immediately..but does it fire with the paramteres passed when resolve(data) or resolveWith  was fired?
[19:03:43] <MistuhKurtz> Your 700px bottom margin just wasn't creating a scrollbar in IE7
[19:04:36] <MistuhKurtz> I checked in IE7, lsterling
[19:04:37] <lsterling> doh.
[19:04:41] <MistuhKurtz> haha
[19:04:52] <lsterling> (backs away quietly nothing to see here!)
[19:05:02] <lsterling> thanks MistuhKurtz my brain is mush tonight
[19:06:10] <Ukto> not sure why json is cuasing XSS errors with FF either, and trying to provide a JSON via get when i hit play with just a form in it
[19:06:18] <Ukto> er json/jsfiddle
[19:07:15] <abjorn> dodoodododododo
[19:07:36] <MistuhKurtz> np :)
[19:08:21] <MistuhKurtz> well if you're performing an async request to a different domain from jsfiddle.net Ukto
[19:08:37] <MistuhKurtz> that would violate the same origin policy
[19:08:49] <Ukto> i just have <form></form> ;)
[19:08:57] <Ukto> thats teh only thing in the jsfiddle
[19:11:08] <Ukto> would you mind taking a look tho? I have form id someForm, and I do a  $('#someForm').submit(function(zeepo) { zeepo.preventDefault(); $('#ActionBox').dialog({ (blahblah) }); $('#ActionBox').html($(this).closest('input').find('.textClassName').attr('value')); });    I cant seem to get the value of the text input with the class 'textClassName' (the only one in each form)
[19:11:50] <Ukto> the .html() is right after the dialog, and i thought it was odd cause i cant access zeepo either
[19:12:19] <track0x1> how can i accomplish http://beuteiful.com/wip/test2.htm (note the white auto-expanding area 'emptyspace') without using javascript?
[19:15:44] <Ukto> http://jsfiddle.net/N2mtP/ is what I am working on. $(this).closest('input').find('.option_type').attr('value')  does not return the value
[19:16:07] <Ukto> I would love to post the form, but an use of <form></form> keeps jsfiddle from working
[19:16:29] <Max-P> track0x1: You can't exactly. The best you can in pure CSS is having the green block appear at the same place, but filling the content will fill the white gap.
[19:17:29] <track0x1> Max-P: so basically by doing #country background-color: #FFF (then resulting in no transparency)
[19:18:01] <Max-P> track0x1: I think I misunderstood your problem then =/
[19:18:39] <track0x1> Max-P: look at http://beuteiful.com/wip/test.htm compared to http://beuteiful.com/wip/test2.htm
[19:19:46] <Max-P> track0x1: yeah, there's white filling the rest of the page
[19:20:19] <track0x1> Max-P, if you resize test2, you will notice that the white area expands and collapses based on how much content is in the actual black area
[19:21:59] <Max-P> track0x1: Not here =/ The white area never resizes untile I resize the browser window.
[19:22:11] <Max-P> oups
[19:22:12] <Max-P> nevermind
[19:23:28] <Max-P> I don't understand your problem, track0x1, good luck =/
[19:23:42] <track0x1> it's a really complicated issue, thanks tho
[19:30:09] <track0x1> is there a way to handle events when the height of a div changes?
[19:33:23] <Eviltwin> You mean is there an event for when the height of a div changes? No
[19:34:42] <track0x1> there is no way to check that?
[19:36:41] <styol> track0x1: probably preferable to try and hook the event allowing the height of the div to change, if possible
[19:37:12] <track0x1> i tried $('#myDiv').bind("resize", function() { // code to exec });
[19:37:18] <track0x1> but that didn't do it
[19:38:14] <styol> track0x1: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[19:39:12] <track0x1> oh sweet lets try this out
[19:40:12] <MrGando> Hey guys, I'm using jQuery $.post in a function. I wanted to know how could I return the server response in the scope of my function ? Right now the var 'data' is undefined ... how could I make this happen ? https://gist.github.com/4677f1943c27c974d8ef
[19:43:02] <styol> MrGando: what might be happening is data is returned before the post is completed. to test that, move return data; into the post callback
[19:43:19] <MrGando> styol yeah, that's what's happening ... how could I overcome this ?
[19:43:45] <styol> MrGando: move your logic or next step into the post callback
[19:44:34] <MrGando> styol I would like to use that function as 'var results = validate_reward('reward_code'); '
[19:44:47] <MrGando> styol so I can then handle the results
[19:45:31] <MrGando> styol is this possible at all in this context ?
[19:46:12] <styol> MrGando: yes but if you're having a function call itself and passing the first argument as a string in both scenarios, you may need an additional argument to specify that this is the reward code, not the invite code
[19:46:54] <MrGando> styol could you gist an example for me ? I'm quite new to JS and jQuery ... I would really appreciate that
[19:47:54] <styol> MrGando: sure one sec
[19:48:00] <MrGando> styol thanks sir!
[19:51:50] <styol> MrGando: http://pastie.org/4118149
[19:53:33] <MrGando> styol awesome, loved that solution
[19:54:13] <MrGando> styol thanks :) , learned quite a few things from your solution
[19:54:37] <styol> MrGando: i forgot to return something in the reward area but yeah no problem
[19:54:50] <MrGando> styol yeah noticed, but I get the idea. Thanks :)
[19:56:30] <styol> MrGando: actually another approach was probably not doing the typeof and just relying on the switch of default instead of setting a default case to invite
[19:57:07] <MrGando> styol yeah, I think that could be even nicer, will try that out
[20:12:47] <iateadonut> $('.numKeywords').bind('click', ... can't figure out for the life of me why this is not binding to a <span class='numKeywords'>...
[20:15:05] <MrGando> styol I guess I'm doing the return thing incorrectly :( , I still get undefined when I do data = validate_reward ... https://gist.github.com/50f92dd6c0079d7f88b8
[20:16:29] <styol> MrGando: are you executing this function with the first argument as 'send'?
[20:16:57] <MrGando> styol nvm I found the problem :)
[20:17:04] <MrGando> styol tunnel vision for a sec
[20:17:09] <styol> MrGando: ah ok
[20:23:56] <iateadonut> can i not bind a function to a class?
[20:25:04] <iateadonut> it's very strange - when i run this: $('#overviewTable .numKeywords').css('cursor', 'hand').css('cursor', 'pointer').css('text-decoration', 'underline');  - it doesn't modify the span with class='numKeywords'
[20:25:04] <iateadonut> but when i run this: $('#overviewTable').css('cursor', 'hand').css('cursor', 'pointer').css('text-decoration', 'underline');, it does modify the table with id='overviewTable'
[20:25:18] <MrGando> styol Ok, I didn't fix the issue... the problem is that the actual return happens after I need the data. In this case ( https://gist.github.com/50f92dd6c0079d7f88b8 ) line 12 , get's executed after line 29, which results in Uncaught Error .
[20:26:16] <MrGando> styol don't really know how could I fix this ... in other languages I would subscribe to an event or use some sort of delegation pattern
[20:27:42] <MrGando> styol any clue of what could be going on here ?
[20:28:21] <styol> MrGando: well, one thing is you're validating the invote code 'send'
[20:30:48] <styol> MrGando: http://pastie.org/4118276
[20:31:49] <MrGando> styol good idea :) , I'll check it o ut
[20:31:51] <MrGando> *out
[20:32:14] <styol> MrGando: also might as well drop the function calling itself and switch and all that and just return at the end of the post response
[20:32:36] <styol> MrGando: and/dor just do the post response within your other post response ;)
[20:32:41] <styol> *and/or
[20:32:51] <MrGando> styol will show you my code after fixes
[20:41:15] <MrGando> styol thanks for your help https://gist.github.com/8e45c84e8d21b4c0d803 , my background with Lua helps me a lot in order to understand Javascript stuff
[20:41:34] <MrGando> styol but I'm still new to it... could understand what you did with no problem :) , thanks for helping me out
[20:43:10] <styol> MrGando: awesome, happy to help. I'm pretty new as well and still learning, probably shouldn't be trying to help that being the case haha
[20:43:45] <MrGando> styol one should always try when there's a chance :)
[20:44:57] <styol> MrGando: I think this is mostly because I've been doing a bit of node.js lately so it sounded familiar. Generally you were experiencing the difference between synchronous and asynchronous fun
[20:45:15] <MrGando> styol yeah, exactly :)
[20:45:42] <styol> I eat callback spaghetti on the regs haha
[20:47:13] <lsterling> I need help. http://jsfiddle.net/8aaBP/12/  I am using slideToggle on hover for a wordpress dropdown menu and it's glitchy. At random, when clicking through one submenu, it will reveal another menu as if you're on that page. I couldn't get it to totally work in the jsfiddle, so I can PM you the live site if you want to see the menu in action and you'll see what I mean. But perhaps someone could tell just by looking at the c
[20:47:14] <lsterling> in jsfiddle what I'm doing wrong?
[20:50:20] <lsterling> It was a pre made theme, and the menu originally toggled on click. But I changed it to hover. It's held together with chewing gum and a prayer, so I'm sure I've just done something wonky, but I've reached the end of my skill level to figure out what.
[20:52:28] <lsterling> Or can anyone point me to a site where I can pay someone to fix it before tomorrow? I'm that desparate.
[20:53:58] <systemfault> lsterling: I could take a look at it quickly but since it's wordpress..
[20:54:39] <systemfault> (I can't promise I'll be able to fix it)
[20:55:00] <lsterling> I appreciate you taking a look.
[20:55:09] <lsterling> Should I PM you the URL?
[20:55:30] <systemfault> lsterling:Yeah
[20:55:44] <Max-P> lsterling: Give the link to me too, I'll have a look on my next break if systemfault did not find the solution
[20:58:02] <lsterling> awesome - thank you Max.
[20:58:49] <aponymous> Hi. Trying to create a slider with jqueryui 1.8.21, as in http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider but nothing at all's being displayed. My code's on http://0au.de/~apo/jstest.html
[20:59:02] <aponymous> chrome's showing a computed height of 0px, which is kind of weird
[20:59:13] <aponymous> But manually setting that to something bigger doesn't work either
[20:59:16] <aponymous> Any ideas?
[21:04:05] <aponymous> magcius: oh hai
[21:08:09] <Koganei> how can I do bar = 'left'; $('foo').animate({  bar : '0px'  }); ? this doesn't seem to work :s
[21:15:35] <RonWhoCares> Is there a reason why the new image of the letter is not displayed in the exact position of the current letter when it is clicked on?  http://www.theverseoftheday.info/Bible-knowledge-phrase-solver/
[21:15:45] <RonWhoCares> and what do I need to do so it will be?
[21:15:55] <RonWhoCares> (I am referring to the first alphabet
[21:16:31] <iateadonut> $('#overviewTable' ).css('color', 'red'); that works to make table id=myTable1 letters red.
[21:16:44] <iateadonut> $('#myTable1' ).css('color', 'red');  -but that does not
[21:16:59] <iateadonut> myTable1 is contained within div#overviewTable
[21:17:07] <iateadonut> i really don't get it.  it's driving me crazy
[21:33:49] <Behi> when I assign a custom function as a draggable helper, draggable( "option", "helper" ) returns the function rather than the element created by the function. Is there a way to get the element instead?
[21:41:38] <coldhead> Behi: i thought the element was available in a var called `helper`
[21:41:54] <Behi> this.helper?
[21:42:08] <Behi> let me check  coldhead
[21:43:06] <Behi> coldhead looks like it isn't
[21:44:54] <LoneStar99> is the following correct -->$(".tb-www.bx").css("backgroundColor","#047AF3");   ??
[21:46:27] <Behi> LoneStar99 yes, looks legit. why?
[21:46:56] <LoneStar99> k for some reason aint workin, let me look further
[21:48:59] <Behi> LoneStar99, actually looks wrong
[21:49:02] <Behi> Do this instead:
[21:49:18] <Behi> $(this).css({backgroundColor: '#...'});
[21:49:18] <Behi> or
[21:49:27] <Behi> $(this).css('background-color', '#...');
[21:50:21] <LoneStar99> behi ok thanks
[21:52:25] <Whirl3d_> hey lsterling, what's up?
[21:52:46] <coldhead> LoneStar99: you can't use . in a className
[21:53:05] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/xH3JZ/
[21:53:34] <coldhead> you have to escape it like http://jsfiddle.net/xH3JZ/1/
[21:53:40] <coldhead> but it's generally icky
[21:53:47] <LoneStar99> coldhead: yeah that was the error, mistyped the name
[21:53:49] <LoneStar99> thanks
[21:53:58] <systemfault> ZzZzzzz
[21:54:16] <LoneStar99> and also used "background-color" instead of dom "backgroundColor"
[21:54:50] <Whirl3d_> if you have a deferred object that has been resolved with someting...and you bind a handler to the done event after it has already been resolved, it fires the handler immediately. But does it fire the handler in the scope of the thing that is was resolved with?
[21:55:51] <Whirl3d_> and when you resolve (or reject) a deferred, you can pass data in the resolve(data) param. Will future bindings also receive this data?
[21:57:30] <Whirl3d_> and if somethig was resolvedWith(scope) and you get the state of the deferred, do you only get "resolved" or do you somehow have access to scope? Say if you wanted to trigger another deferred identically...
[21:59:32] <JonathanNeal> Hello again.
[22:00:04] <Whirl3d_> hello what's up?
[22:00:48] <JonathanNeal> On the subject of .closest(), I was trying think of what the best name would be for the native equivalent.
[22:01:02] <aro> ?
[22:01:17] <Whirl3d_> ?
[22:01:17] <JonathanNeal> We have querySelector, which searches the decedents, but no way to search up the tree.
[22:02:16] <JonathanNeal> closest is a confusing name though, since closest could refer to the children as well.
[22:03:06] <Dr-Bombay> it's not a native operation. It's a jquery operation
[22:03:29] <JonathanNeal> I was thinking ancestorQuerySelector, since it keeps "querySelector" and borrows the "ancestor" term from Ranges.  My wife suggested "anteQuerySelector" since ante means before, like how you wager before a game. Any opinions?
[22:03:51] <JonathanNeal> Dr-Bombay: yes, I was going to suggest a convention for the native implementation though.
[22:04:36] <JonathanNeal> I think the jQuery function could be really useful in native, as querySelector is.
[22:04:50] <systemfault> Or perhaps a dumber idea like adding a second parameter to querySelector..
[22:05:01] <systemfault> a boolean called "reverse"
[22:05:26] <Dr-Bombay> this question makes no sense
[22:05:57] <JonathanNeal> systemfault: yea, booleans are often misleading and arbitrary.
[22:06:09] <systemfault> I agree
[22:06:19] <systemfault> Still, that's how the DOM likes it.
[22:06:38] <systemfault> See addEventListener and XMLHttpRequest...
[22:06:39] <JonathanNeal> Sadly, often it does. In the case of DOM lookups, I don't think it's ever been done, though.
[22:06:48] <systemfault> Ah, right.
[22:07:22] <JonathanNeal> addEventListener has a boolean at the end, but most of the time it is ignored.  It's creating events where you bump into the arity of 12.
[22:08:17] <JonathanNeal> without libraries like jQuery, we basically had getElementsByTagName and getElementById, and querySelector went a new direction, naming convention wise.  It wasn't getElementsByQuery
[22:08:37] <Dr-Bombay> what would a cat look like, if it it were a dog?
[22:08:58] <systemfault> Dr-Bombay: What would you look like if you were a cat?
[22:09:12] <Dr-Bombay> how many legs does a dog have, if you count the tail?
[22:09:31] <Whirl3d_> or how long is a piece of string?
[22:09:38] <andrewhl_> One thing I'd love to figure out one day is how jquery manages to access any dom element
[22:10:16] <JonathanNeal> So, if we were to suggest a native function like closest, do you think a name like anteQuerySelector would be a good fit?
[22:11:17] <Whirl3d_> what do you mean by native?
[22:11:26] <Dr-Bombay> no, i think that name would be horrifying
[22:11:37] <Dr-Bombay> since you asked
[22:11:44] <coldhead> harsh
[22:11:45] <Whirl3d_> too close to antiquery
[22:12:07] <Whirl3d_> sounds like antique weery
[22:12:24] <JonathanNeal> ancestorQuerySelector?
[22:12:53] <Whirl3d_> bored much?
[22:13:23] <coldhead> i like ancestor
[22:13:27] <Dr-Bombay> andrewhl: traversal. glad I could help.
[22:13:30] <coldhead> requires less latin than ante
[22:14:29] <iateadonut> how do i refer to the <th> above the <td> that was just clicked on if that td is $(node) ?
[22:14:31] <JonathanNeal> coldhead: yea, there's not a lot of latin in javascript or jQuery.
[22:14:52] <JonathanNeal> Does anyone know why the name "closest" was chosen?
[22:15:50] <aro> why do you care
[22:15:55] <aro> because its logical
[22:16:00] <iateadonut> they meant 'closet' but someone put an 's' in there
[22:16:06] <aro> LOL
[22:16:45] <Whirl3d_> forequery
[22:16:55] <Dr-Bombay> whirl: ugh
[22:16:59] <Whirl3d_> lol
[22:17:18] <Whirl3d_> grand and great gran query is prolly out of the question
[22:17:25] <JonathanNeal> foreQuerySelector, like ante, definitely a little left field.
[22:17:47] <Dr-Bombay> this is not the kind of thing you encode in a method name. You make it a separate parameter, like xpath does
[22:17:50] <iateadonut> if i've got a div and i want to assign something, like <div date='2011-02' id='myDiv'>, is that legal/acceptable and can i grab that information at a later time?
[22:17:53] <Whirl3d_> yreuQ selector
[22:17:58] <systemfault> DOM sucks.. I'm sure they would come up with a stupid boolean :D
[22:18:08] <coldhead> JonathanNeal: closest.patch: This adds a new method: .closest(selector). You can
[22:18:09] <coldhead> think of it as .firstSelfOrAncestor.
[22:18:12] <systemfault> If the W3C would do it.
[22:18:14] <coldhead> that's from resig
[22:18:24] <nicovalencia> iateadonut: check out .parents() and .data()
[22:18:40] <JonathanNeal> Ah, because it can also mean itself, that's why he called it closest.
[22:18:58] <nicovalencia> You can pass .parents() a selector to match, and it's results will be in order, closest to your node.
[22:19:24] <JonathanNeal> When I thought about parentQuerySelector, I presumed that meant it was trying to match the parent, not all parents.
[22:19:43] <Whirl3d_> inQuery...lol preQuery?
[22:19:46] <iateadonut> for .data(), the point is that the table is made from php the first time, so it'd be nice to just add the date='2011-02' or whatever to it
[22:20:02] <iateadonut> (checking out parents)
[22:20:10] <nicovalencia> You can access data by assigning the attributes in a date-XXXX format.
[22:20:32] <coldhead> data-XXXX*
[22:20:33] <nicovalencia> data-XXXXX *
[22:20:36] <nicovalencia> thanks coldhead
[22:20:45] <coldhead> MY PLEASURE NICO
[22:20:49] <nicovalencia> NO MINE!
[22:21:03] <coldhead> OUR PLEASURE
[22:21:05] <coldhead> sharing is caring
[22:21:12] <nicovalencia> I didn't get to see you at TXJS coldhead - how come you didn't tell me you were going!?
[22:21:22] <coldhead> I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE THERE
[22:21:29] <coldhead> i blame wookiehangover for all this
[22:21:36] <coldhead> he could have made the connexion
[22:21:38] <coldhead> but nooo
[22:21:38] <nicovalencia> I didn't go since I'm going to TX next week :(
[22:21:39] <coldhead> nooo
[22:21:43] <coldhead> oh right
[22:21:45] <nicovalencia> .. but if i had known you were going!!!!
[22:21:50] <coldhead> well in that case he's off the hook
[22:21:53] <o]> fap fap fap
[22:22:00] <nicovalencia> Yeah wookiehangover's fault. Then he took off to vacation tiem.
[22:22:08] <coldhead> what a jerk
[22:22:10] <iateadonut> oh, very cool.
[22:22:11] <iateadonut> thanks.
[22:23:36] <nicovalencia> Tell me next time you are in the country, and I'll find an excuse to hit up a conference hah.
[22:25:22] <o]> how can I know if the shift key is pressed in the mouseenter event callback function?
[22:25:28] <coldhead> i will advertise more grandly next time, nicovalencia
[22:25:36] <coldhead> meanwhile why don't you come talk at jsconfau
[22:25:48] <coldhead> all expenses, baby
[22:26:01] <nicovalencia> including plane tix?
[22:26:21] <coldhead> one would assume
[22:26:33] <nicovalencia> When is that happening?
[22:26:40] <coldhead> wouldn't we love to know
[22:26:48] <coldhead> august september, i get the feeling
[22:26:53] <coldhead> but the website is next to useless
[22:27:53] <coldhead> it might be their first day organising a conf
[22:28:41] <o]> is there a way to see if the shift key is pressed on mouseenter event function callback?
[22:28:46] <o]> please
[22:29:21] <danheberden> o]: get the time of the mouseenter event. bind an event to keydown. compare the time.
[22:29:26] <danheberden> it's really that easy!
[22:29:35] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1441086/shift-mouseover-with-jquery
[22:29:46] <danheberden> whoa, and his first day with jQuery too
[22:29:54] <danheberden> coldhead, you're really doing good today
[22:30:18] <coldhead> thanks dan
[22:30:27] <coldhead> a beautiful woman showed me how to use google lol
[22:30:58] <danheberden> coldhead i showed you how to use google...
[22:31:04] <danheberden> also, thank you
[22:31:07] <danheberden> i owe you a blowie
[22:31:09] <nicovalencia> dan you are the most beautiful woman i've met
[22:31:23] <nicovalencia> coldhead knows what he's talking about
[22:31:25] * coldhead swoons
[22:31:29] <nicovalencia> -_-
[22:31:46] <danheberden> nicovalencia: if only we had more time
[22:31:49] <danheberden> IF ONLY WE HAD MORE TIME
[22:31:57] <danheberden> i wanted to ride more than that bull, if you know what i mean
[22:32:43] <danheberden> also, is jessica seeing anyone nicovalencia?
[22:33:31] <nicovalencia> >_< ha, not sure, want me to let her know you asked?
[22:34:09] <danheberden> yeah, ask her and max
[22:34:16] <danheberden> ... you know, seperately
[22:34:23] <nicovalencia> haha
[22:34:49] <coldhead> stay classy, QL
[22:35:34] <raj> if I make something position:fixed, how can I make sure it's in the exact same width it was before adding position:fixed ?
[22:36:32] <danheberden> i assume you aren't setting, like, width:300px
[22:36:38] <raj> right
[22:37:41] <danheberden> so, like, get the width(), update it's class/style to position:fixed and set the width as a pixel width
[22:38:06] <o]> coldhead: that example is not working :(
[22:39:00] <danheberden> coldhead: what are we paying you for?! non-functional examples?!!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?111111
[22:39:17] <danheberden> JUST BECAUSE YOU ARENT IN AMERICA ANYMORE
[22:39:24] <o]> I had to change to keydown
[22:39:31] <danheberden> twss
[22:40:26] <coldhead> i am so sorry
[22:40:27] <o]> now keyup never works. die jquery!
[22:40:43] <danheberden> yes, definitely jQuery's fault
[22:40:52] <nicovalencia> there's a bug for that
[22:40:53] <o]> :]
[22:40:56] <nicovalencia> for sure
[22:40:58] <coldhead> you should be doing something simpler
[22:41:12] <danheberden> confirm('were you pressing the shift key?')
[22:42:18] <coldhead> that's MY kind of solution
[22:42:27] <o]> if(e.shiftKey) { ...
[22:42:27] <coldhead> also that's better accessibility
[22:42:35] <o]> that works on keydown, but not on keyup
[22:42:40] <danheberden> o]: correct
[22:42:41] <coldhead> because it's hard for people with one arm to hold shift and move the mouse at the same time
[22:42:45] <danheberden> that's how the event itself works
[22:42:58] <danheberden> what about keypress
[22:43:10] <o]> keypress ignores that also
[22:43:28] <coldhead> i'm glad we had this talk
[22:43:34] <o]> yeah! better ignore that shift thing
[22:43:34] <danheberden> well all settled
[22:43:43] <raj> danheberden, $(this).width() isn't giving me the correct width
[22:43:46] <danheberden> what kind of shift is this
[22:43:48] <o]> doing UI with js is pointless
[22:43:52] <danheberden> o]: you can also get shift keycodes
[22:44:00] <danheberden> i forget .which ones they are tho
[22:44:07] <o]> will that be portable?
[22:44:22] <offlim> hi can someone please help me? i dont know much jquery but im trying to add a code where if the web browser width is resized to 800px then a wrapping div tag is added to a existing div tag
[22:44:25] <styol> coldhead: good game
[22:44:35] <danheberden> if it helps: https://github.com/danheberden/jquery-key
[22:44:40] <o]> it is very easy logging the keycodes, but I am worried about portability
[22:44:52] <danheberden> you can take the jQueries anywhere you go
[22:45:10] <coldhead> i am worried about HPV
[22:45:15] <danheberden>  my buddy my buddy 
[22:45:21] <danheberden> coldhead there's a vaccine for that
[22:45:32] <ColKurtz> offlim you can use @media-queries in your CSS files to use different styles at different widths (like 800px and up or down)
[22:45:37] <danheberden> it's ok if you get cervical cancer
[22:46:15] <raj> danheberden, do you know there are nodes named after you?
[22:46:16] <coldhead> it is and it isn't
[22:46:26] <raj> due to rheumatoid arthritis
[22:46:31] <thomedy> okay i am working with an aging machine would someone please go to my site and tell me if they are seeing the same jumps in animations that i am getting
[22:46:35] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[22:46:39] <danheberden> raj yes it was the most exciting visit to a rheumatologist i ever had
[22:46:42] <danheberden> i felt like a celebrity
[22:46:50] <danheberden> thanks whatever great grandfather discovered that
[22:46:51] <raj> awesome
[22:46:59] <danheberden> he was a good dude, tending to the queen 'n what not
[22:47:12] <raj> i bet you're loaded
[22:47:25] <danheberden> haha, right - all we have is a coin room named after us at oxford
[22:47:37] <raj> like scrooge mcduck had?
[22:47:43] <danheberden> BETTEER
[22:47:51] <danheberden> and now you know my heritage
[22:47:56] <danheberden> YOU FUCKING STALKER
[22:47:59] <danheberden> :D
[22:48:07] <raj> yeah, i've been looking for you a long time
[22:48:19] <danheberden> are we soulmates?
[22:48:25] <danheberden> i hope you're fit
[22:48:33] <raj> anyway, now thta i've got your attention, how the hell do I program this?
[22:48:34] <raj> :)
[22:48:38] <thomedy> ha ha
[22:48:52] <danheberden> i think you want offsetWidth() maybe?
[22:48:58] <coldhead> oh awesome http://www.ashmolean.org/departments/heberdencoinroom/
[22:48:59] <danheberden> one of them gives the right pixel width
[22:49:15] <danheberden> coldhead i have the brochure!
[22:49:25] <danheberden> except i haven't, like, actually gone there.
[22:49:27] <danheberden> just my bro
[22:49:29] <coldhead> i have the site bookmarked
[22:49:53] <danheberden> they had never had a heberden there, which was comical
[22:50:00] <coldhead> numismatists are kinda jerks
[22:50:02] <danheberden> you know, for a heberden coin room
[22:50:14] <offlim> ColKurtz: yes i know about the @media-queries but i have a jquery code and i need 1 code to be used when the browser width is higher then 800px and another if the browser is below 800px
[22:50:31] <danheberden> "a jquery code" - offlim, do you mind if i quote you on that?
[22:50:38] <danheberden> like, later?
[22:50:42] <o]> how can I call an event callback from another and keep the $(this) being valid?
[22:50:48] <ColKurtz> lolol
[22:50:49] <raj> danheberden, now jquery way?
[22:50:55] <sacho_> assign it to another variable, o]
[22:50:55] <raj> *no
[22:50:58] <danheberden> o]: function scope is the way to what you seek

[22:51:59] <thomedy> i have a jumpy animation and i dont like it one bit ... whats more i dont know why... im assuming too much js but that doesn't really make sense to me
[22:51:59] <danheberden> fuck you bot-t1
[22:52:04] <raj> nope, that didn't work either
[22:52:04] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[22:52:12] <thomedy> can someone point me in the right direction
[22:52:14] <danheberden> lol what are you getting with it?
[22:52:21] <danheberden> does the element have a width?
[22:52:23] <danheberden> when you inspect it?
[22:52:24] <offlim> i need the maxScale6 and minScale6 changed if the browser width is below 800px
[22:52:49] <raj> danheberden, those are all getting the width that would be if I had `float` on it
[22:52:59] <ColKurtz> $(window).resize(function() { };
[22:53:00] <raj> danheberden, no, it doesn't
[22:53:12] <danheberden> well if the element doesn't have a width
[22:53:16] <ColKurtz> Research the window object
[22:53:16] <danheberden> what width are you trying to get?
[22:53:22] <danheberden> the jQueries can't read minds
[22:53:26] <danheberden> well, not ALL the time anyway
[22:53:27] <raj> danheberden, it's current width
[22:53:30] <raj> *its
[22:53:30] <coldhead> thomedy: this looks very smooth to me
[22:53:34] <thomedy> does it
[22:53:42] <raj> visually
[22:53:47] <raj> not in the css
[22:53:52] <danheberden> raj: yes
[22:53:54] <coldhead> oh i see what you mean
[22:53:56] <danheberden> that's what outerWIdth does
[22:53:56] <coldhead> when i click a link
[22:54:05] <thomedy> right no bueno
[22:54:07] <raj> didn't work
[22:54:08] <danheberden> it get's it's offsetWidth from the dom element
[22:54:09] <thomedy> thats no good
[22:54:14] <danheberden> try inspecting the element directly
[22:54:22] <danheberden> look at the clientWIdth and outerWIdth
[22:54:22] <thomedy> it has to be smooth and shiny
[22:54:27] <danheberden> see if something is wonky there
[22:54:35] <danheberden> sorry for the mistypes, i've had a good deal of beer
[22:54:37] <thomedy> shiny is a metaphor for pretty
[22:54:44] <ColKurtz> bamp
[22:54:49] <danheberden> also, outerWidth(true) might be something you need
[22:54:49] <thomedy> any suggestions
[22:54:50] <danheberden> as per the docs
[22:54:56] <coldhead> thomedy: i think it's because you're animating so much, to such giant sizes
[22:55:01] <thomedy> okay
[22:55:05] <thomedy> okay i can work with that
[22:55:06] <danheberden> thomedy: if you need smooth and shiny, i'll need 15 minutes and some lotion
[22:55:07] <coldhead> it might work better if you contain the animation to some smaller element
[22:55:08] <thomedy> one sec please
[22:55:21] <thomedy> ah ha no im good there my wife got me this morning
[22:55:24] <coldhead> like put it in some kind of static frame
[22:55:26] <danheberden> good gal
[22:55:28] <coldhead> erm
[22:55:36] <coldhead> my innocence
[22:55:39] <danheberden> you both aren'y poly by any chance are you?
[22:55:45] <coldhead> my beautiful innocence
[22:55:46] <o]> event.target worked fine for me, instead of using proxy, but thanks for the tip :)
[22:55:54] <thomedy> i have to appologize but i dont know what you mean static frame
[22:56:12] <coldhead> thomedy: you know when you're sipping a dry chardonnay at the art gallery
[22:56:25] <coldhead> and the old paintings in the european wing have frames?
[22:56:29] <coldhead> i mean something like that
[22:56:45] <coldhead> some kind of container around the actual stuff, the container of which does not move
[22:57:37] <coldhead> i guess it is simpler to say "maybe try avoiding animating the entire page"
[22:57:41] <thomedy> oooh i had that to start but someone said that was dumb wait i might have that already if you go to firebug and check you will see overflow_container or what ever its based on window width but it doesn't animat
[22:58:10] <thomedy> let me shrink the size of the animation first see what that does
[22:58:27] <thomedy> cuz my concern is that if i dont animate the whole page i loose the effect m
[22:58:33] <thomedy> you might have a better idea than i do
[22:58:45] <thomedy> if so im listening let me try that size thing right now though
[23:02:55] <coldhead> thomedy: i'm no expert, i've just seen that animations involving the entire window are slower than animations in a smaller container
[23:03:18] <coldhead> i guess because the full window stuff involves the borders of the window
[23:03:26] <coldhead> which are computationally more expensive
[23:03:36] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[23:08:17] <raj> danheberden, http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/g9Ut6/
[23:08:30] <raj> position:fixed causes the element to collapse on its contents
[23:08:47] <raj> it doesn't stretch the way position:static elements do
[23:10:14] <raj> nm
[23:10:18] <raj> I screwed up my js
[23:14:38] <coldhead> in your face, dan
[23:16:54] <thomedy> it seems like it works to just shrink my container div
[23:19:15] <raj> has anyone ever used Waypoint? If I scroll down too fast, it misses the way point
[23:21:05] <thomedy> okay thats better not quite there yet
[23:31:58] <thomedy> okay i shrunk down my container and im still getting jumps
[23:34:24] <X-tonic> hey, i need to do something like on click of a particular class, do a function. But no object of that type is there when the page is initially populated. On doing some other action, element of that class is generated. How do i go about doing this?
[23:36:09] <sacho_> X-tonic, see live() and on()
[23:36:15] <coldhead> ?on
[23:36:15] <bot-t1> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[23:36:22] <coldhead> thanks bots-t!
[23:36:55] <Dr-Bombay> you already said that
[23:37:39] <Whirl3d_> thomedy have you considered implementing the transitions plugin?
[23:38:34] <coldhead> sweet suggestion, Whirl3d_++
[23:40:49] <Whirl3d_> did someone already suggest that and it got shot down?
[23:41:08] <coldhead> your sarcasm detector is registering false positives
[23:41:18] <thomedy> im looking at one right now
[23:41:23] <coldhead> its the right thing to suggest and i'm glad you did so
[23:41:47] <thomedy> when you say transition plugin you are referring to easing?
[23:42:12] <Whirl3d_> I was referring to a plugin that substitutes css3 transitions for jquery animation
[23:42:51] <coldhead> which is good because it's native to the browser and faster and smoother
[23:42:53] <Whirl3d_> it happens all in the background and it is supposed to enable hardware acceleration for browsers that support it. (like i devices)
[23:43:40] <thomedy> okay okay see that actuall wouldn't work because i using this particalr design as a downstep from webgl
[23:43:55] <thomedy> so it has to beable to work without hardware acceleration
[23:44:00] <thomedy> which is what webgl does
[23:44:17] <Whirl3d_> it would work.
[23:44:23] <coldhead> it will work smoother when webgl is available
[23:44:29] <coldhead> futureproof
[23:44:49] <thomedy> okay then im very interested in growing my knowledge and fixing this animation link me if you have it
[23:45:12] <Whirl3d_> and the beauty if it is you just stick it in your header and bury your head in the sand. It does the rest for you
[23:45:32] <thomedy> oh good burying my head in the sand sounds good cuz that means i can sleep
[23:45:44] <thomedy> and its hot here so the sand should be cool
[23:45:48] <Whirl3d_> There are several out there. but I picked one that I liked the best. Lemme look it up.
[23:45:53] <coldhead> i'm not sure it works like that
[23:45:58] <thomedy> no it does
[23:46:07] * coldhead takes notes
[23:46:08] <thomedy> i dont want to hear it... it works
[23:46:28] <thomedy> 8)
[23:46:36] <thomedy> i had to look that up cuz i never use those
[23:47:23] <Koganei> any way to get the 'difference' in a css() or animate() call? like, some css map I could get to which reapplying it to the same element would bring it back to the way it was
[23:49:45] * Koganei killed the chan :o
[23:49:49] <Whirl3d_> see the one that I like patches the fx engine, not the animation call.   https://github.com/louisremi/jquery.transition.js/
[23:50:46] <Whirl3d_> Koganei, you should consider looking up jq1.8  . gnarf built a lot of that into it. It looks good
[23:51:08] <Koganei> oh? coool
[23:51:12] <Whirl3d_> http://www.jstween.org/
[23:51:14] <Trisox> coldhead
[23:51:14] <caniuse> Trisox: coldhead: a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[23:51:32] <Whirl3d_> this engine is a little big, but its got a great api and it's really flexible.
[23:51:47] <Whirl3d_> you can setup yoyo animations that do exactly what you want
[23:52:03] <thomedy> im looking at both of them
[23:52:28] <thomedy> and you think this will smooth at my animations
[23:52:32] <Whirl3d_> thomedy, sorry though you may like them, I posted the transitions for you issue
[23:52:48] <Whirl3d_> the others were for Koganei
[23:52:55] <thomedy> okay one sec
[23:52:58] <thomedy> ill do that right now
[23:53:18] <thomedy> now ill look at not two of them
[23:53:59] <Koganei> sweet
[23:54:08] <Koganei> I also thought they were for thomedy
[23:55:29] <Whirl3d_> lol...and btw, thomedy, your animations are smooth for me and I have a huge monitor at 2560 res
[23:55:45] <thomedy> #$%T thats big
[23:55:52] <thomedy> i have [] little one
[23:56:21] <thomedy> even the slide transitions page animations
[23:56:33] <Whirl3d_> I didn't look, but you could consider not animating anything but the color bg and then fade in the text when it's done
[23:56:53] <thomedy> i appreciate it but no way i love the effect
[23:57:15] <thomedy> it has to be right and all the way what i want ... still thank you for the suggestion
[23:57:21] <thomedy> i refuse to back down from good
[23:57:26] <thomedy> hard or not
[23:57:52] <thomedy> the only thing i back down from is sleep  i am not looking forward to this all nighter
[23:58:04] <Whirl3d_> You should try it...I think you might be surprised and how much better it looks not to have text animate like that. I can find a couple of examples of a similar animation effect and with the text fading in at the end, the mind doesn't even notice
[23:59:03] <thomedy> well i think i could see it in my head
[23:59:07] <thomedy> i might be wrong
[23:59:28] <thomedy> question.. im looking for a way to see posible easing options... am i going to just have to read the .js
