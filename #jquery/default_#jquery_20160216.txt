[00:00:52] <arc_> i don't see why that wouldn't work, assuming you are selecting what you think you are
[00:01:45] <jphase> phelix: I'd go one step further and not set the variable if I had to do something like that personally
[00:01:57] <phelix> but if I just ran var selector = '#' + $(this).parents('.servicesPop').attr('id'); I couldn't just do selector.addClass('x');
[00:02:16] <arc_> $(selector).addClass('x');
[00:02:25] <arc_> selector being the variable
[00:02:28] <phelix> looking for same result as if i I actually created it with var selector = $('#yadda');
[00:02:56] <phelix> Yea, I could do it that way I guess.. was just wondering if I could possibly turn the whole selector into its own variable
[00:02:58] <jphase> phelix: var servicePop = $('#' + $(this).parents('.servicesPop').attr('id') );  servicePop.addClass('x'); will work
[00:03:15] <phelix> really.. let me try it again
[00:03:27] <jphase> phelix: mine is different than yours
[00:03:37] <jphase> phelix: read again
[00:04:04] <phelix> thing is if I console.log(selector) it only prints #theid not the same as it would if I console.log($('#theid'));
[00:04:20] <jphase> phelix: you're not listening, hehe
[00:04:31] <phelix> ohh i see
[00:04:45] <jphase> an additional object wrapper
[00:05:20] <phelix> yeah that worked. Thanks.. can't believe i didn't think about that.
[00:05:34] <jphase> np
[00:08:14] <irmoathlete> guys have any advice as to where to get some code review on my first public js library?
[01:02:37] <ThomQ> Hi all. I got some trouble when trying to hide an element. This is a simple 5 line pastebin of what I´m trying to do: http://pastebin.com/vtcs87mj
[01:03:16] <ThomQ> after starting the page I need the vid to be hidden. I´ve tried multiple combinations, but nothing seems to hide the element. Anybody any idea?
[01:03:56] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[01:04:08] <robertmaxrees> also, you're missing a closing paren.
[01:05:31] <ThomQ> Ah, yeah, its a summary of what code I have. Closing parenteces are right, and no console errors
[01:06:30] <robertmaxrees> and you're not repeating that ID, right?
[01:06:39] <ThomQ> noe
[01:06:42] <ThomQ> nope
[01:07:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/otvgjgfr/ works fine here.
[01:09:34] <ThomQ> hmmm
[01:09:43] <ThomQ> well, deleting everything I have, lets see if it works without
[01:22:51] <ThomQ> Ok cool, I fixed it
[01:22:57] <ThomQ> Thanks, don´t know what was wrong with it
[01:25:22] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[01:29:07] <ThomQ> it must be my inexperience with CSS and javascript. I´m drowning in classes :P
[02:24:26] <norc_> Is there a way to register an event handler by name, so that it can be removed later on?
[02:25:51] <irmoathlete> check this out norc_
[02:25:52] <irmoathlete> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[02:26:19] <irmoathlete> and the counter part: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:27:37] <norc_> irmoathlete: mmm alright thank you.
[02:28:12] <irmoathlete> so basically, you'd register the event handler, then whenever in your code you want to unregister it you can use off
[02:28:30] <irmoathlete> such as if a certain button is clicked etc
[02:28:38] <hellyeah> hey
[02:28:49] <hellyeah> i need help about hquery datepicker ui
[02:28:59] <irmoathlete> what about it?
[02:29:14] <hellyeah> let me try to explain
[02:29:32] <irmoathlete> sure
[02:31:15] <hellyeah> please create datepicker and select the date then click button in result datepicker, then create another datepicker and select the dates then look at result datepicker you will see daates are colorized but the problem is all dates are colorized with same color. I want to show them with different color. Problem is definig dateRange array  in the out
[02:31:15] <hellyeah> side of function but if i define array inside. I cannot apply the dates of second datepickers to the rresult datepicker. Can you take a look and help me how i can fix the issue http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/19/
[02:32:50] <hellyeah> hopy it is understandable
[02:34:31] <hellyeah> hope*
[02:34:47] <irmoathlete> sorry I have no idea what you're trying to do lol
[02:34:53] <norc_> irmoathlete: Well my issue is that Im using a framework that seriously messed with the way the DOM is constructed and events is fired.
[02:35:11] <norc_> irmoathlete: For example I do not have sensible document ready event anymore.
[02:35:36] <hellyeah> irmoathlete: what i try to do colorize the dates in result datepickers.
[02:36:04] <norc_> (Which kind of is the issue since old event handlers do not get cleaned up, since the DOM is just updated in place for any link clicked)
[02:36:08] <hellyeah> irmoathlete: you can create datepickers with select button
[02:36:15] <hellyeah> ops
[02:36:17] <hellyeah> + button
[02:36:27] <irmoathlete> hellyeah, you're just trying to change the background colors on the dates?
[02:36:37] <hellyeah> yes
[02:36:47] <hellyeah> with different color
[02:36:51] <irmoathlete> when you pick a date?
[02:36:58] <hellyeah> yes
[02:37:10] <hellyeah> you pick date in start and end
[02:37:18] <hellyeah> anbd you see colorize date in result
[02:37:23] <irmoathlete> oh i see
[02:37:28] <irmoathlete> so your trouble is just coloring?
[02:37:47] <irmoathlete> norc_ do you have an example?
[02:38:08] <irmoathlete> norc_ hard to tell without some context
[02:38:29] <hellyeah> well i define dateRange outside of datepickers if i define dateRange inside of datepickers the next start date and end date wont apply to result datepickers.
[02:39:42] <hellyeah> check this create datepickers http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/21/ and select the dates then create another datepickers select the date. Date of range in second "start" and "end" wont be applied to result datepickers
[02:40:59] <hellyeah> did you understand irmoathlete ?
[02:41:43] <irmoathlete> hellyeah, I'm sorry I don't know what you're trying to achieve lol.
[02:42:13] <irmoathlete> hellyeah, I select 2 dates from the first, create anther, select 2 dates from that one, then what is the expected result you want to get from that?
[02:42:44] <hellyeah> click show button in result datepickers
[02:42:55] <hellyeah> you must see date of range must be colorized
[02:43:15] <hellyeah> datehighlight1, and datehighlight2 in css
[02:43:21] <irmoathlete> ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
[02:43:22] <irmoathlete> I see
[02:43:37] <irmoathlete> I click the 3 dots and it only highlights the date range from datepicker 1
[02:43:38] <hellyeah> this line   return [enabled, "datehighlight" + i, ""]
[02:43:41] <irmoathlete> is that what you're talking about?
[02:43:48] <hellyeah> yes
[02:43:58] <irmoathlete> but you're trying/wanting to highlight 2 date ranges?
[02:44:03] <irmoathlete> is that what you're having trouble with?
[02:44:10] <hellyeah> yes
[02:44:13] <hellyeah> 2 or more
[02:44:26] <hellyeah> it can be 20 it can be 50 date ranges wityh different color
[02:46:03] <irmoathlete> that's a good question that I do not have the answer to, sorry lol
[02:46:30] <hellyeah> no problem :p
[02:46:33] <hellyeah> thank you
[02:46:54] <irmoathlete> take a look at this
[02:47:02] <irmoathlete> i have no idea if it'll help you or not
[02:47:03] <irmoathlete> http://jsfiddle.net/kslagdive/7NN3p/
[03:15:55] <norc_> irmoathlete: Its fine, I just unconditionally try to remove an event handler before registering it.
[03:16:32] <irmoathlete> oh ok, so you figured out your problem norc_?
[03:45:12] <UniFreak> how can I use .text() to concate an non-break space?
[03:45:31] <UniFreak> tried .text('&nbsp' + text) and .text(' ' + text)
[03:45:35] <UniFreak> both not work
[04:01:46] <Cork> UniFreak: you can't use text with entities
[04:01:54] <Cork> you have to use .html()
[04:02:04] <Cork> alternatively append a textnode
[04:07:14] <UniFreak> Cork: got it, thank you
[04:15:05] <hellyeah> hey pls some help when i pick the dates it is colorized in below calendar when i click pencil button i want to remove css class from spesific date of range pls check line 19-55 what did i do wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/27/
[04:20:42] <Duikb00t> Hello, I am trying to debug a AJAX error on the front end I receive in the error handler of the $ajax part
[04:20:59] <Duikb00t> status: parseerror error: syntaxError: unexpected  token <
[04:21:10] <Duikb00t> Does that mean the problem is in the PHP part, or in the HTML part?
[04:26:38] <Kars-T> Duikb00t: Hi try to look at the raw output of the php. The HTML produced should be static so the error is probably in the php but first take a look at it.
[04:32:21] <Duikb00t> I found it

[04:35:56] <hellyeah> what about this https://api.jquery.com/first/
[04:43:23] <morfin> i had to use :last
[04:43:44] <hellyeah> there is method last()
[04:43:53] <hellyeah> also there is next() and prev()
[04:44:01] <morfin> it works with $(this).prevAll(":last")
[04:44:17] <morfin> i forgot they're in reversed order
[04:44:23] <morfin> from last to first
[05:10:03] <xuia> hi can you explain me this cards.sort( function() { return Math.random() - .5} );
[05:20:32] <Xatenev> xuia: that makes no sense imho
[05:21:16] <Xatenev> xuia: you have to pass .sort a compare function and pass it the parameters of the values, i.e. cards.sort(function(a,b) { return a-b }
[05:21:41] <Xatenev> your function would sort the array cards by random I guess..
[05:22:15] <xuia> yes

[07:30:55] <DeafGoose> Hi All! I am creating dynamically elements after an ajax call, the element in question is .btn-ranking. I would like to trigger the function rankingTooltip() on these dynamic elements however its not working. console.log() works on first click but the function rankingTooltip() only runs on second click, how come? here is my code http://pastebin.com/FqRkSULx
[07:31:21] <PANTOLON> hmm
[07:31:45] <PANTOLON> may be you didnt add you elements to the body before first click
[07:32:58] <DeafGoose> the elements are generated after the ajax call
[07:33:10] <DeafGoose> so Im not really sure why it only gets triggered on second click
[07:33:45] <PANTOLON> it is better to fiddle it
[07:34:26] <DeafGoose> I will try something else
[07:41:38] <Cork> DeafGoose: ratingTooltip most likely triggers on mouseenter or mouseover
[07:41:54] <Cork> that means that when you click on the element you have already gone past that event
[07:42:10] <Cork> so tooltip won't fire until next time you move the mouse into the element
[07:42:40] <Cork> an alternative is to fake fire trigger('mouseenter') on the element as you bind it
[07:42:47] <sayhi> im using ajax to set a hidden field in a html form, then I use ajax to serialze the form.. the value i set is missing.. any idea why?
[07:43:05] <sayhi> serialize & submit
[07:44:16] <sayhi> weird enough.. only the first time i enter the page.. if i refresh it works..
[07:54:22] <DeafGoose> Hi Cork, well this actually triigers a "modal" so the function name is a bit misleading :)
[07:54:35] <DeafGoose> but I havent been able to get it work on first click
[07:54:40] <DeafGoose> just dont understand why
[07:55:07] <DeafGoose> same for all the elements with class .btn-ranking...only gets trigered on second click
[07:57:21] <DeafGoose> however there is a clue, if I click on the element the second time, the function is triggered...and subsequent first clicks do trigger the function
[07:57:49] <DeafGoose> so if I clicked the first time, then subsequently clicks on that element will trigger the function first time
[08:33:36] <PeterPorka> i try to call a function in a flash movie via jquery but all i got is: is not a function
[08:34:43] <PeterPorka> i also tried document.getElementByID, console.log gives me: function anonymous()
[08:48:53] <hellyeah> first i create element and add to body but in DatePickers function i couldnt execute .datepickers why did it happen? http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/29/
[08:50:52] <noregret> .append('<div id="id">') will automatically add </div>?
[08:51:34] <noregret> or is it .append('<div>').prop("id","id")
[08:55:25] <hellyeah> noregret: it looks like this https://jsfiddle.net/2wvf4a15/ take a look may be you need to fix smt
[08:58:16] <noregret> hellyeah: in my case, the first one applies to me. But will </div> be added in all cases?
[08:58:49] <noregret> hellyeah: also, your fiddle doesn't do anything
[09:03:44] <decx> do yourself a favor and create elements separately
[09:04:08] <decx> also append('<div>').prop('id','') will not give the id to the appended thing
[09:04:13] <decx> append doesn't chain
[09:04:24] <hellyeah> .prop or .attr
[09:04:26] <hellyeah> ?
[09:04:37] <decx> there's almost no reason to ever use attr
[09:04:55] <hellyeah> humm
[09:04:56] <noregret> decx: got it
[09:05:26] <hellyeah> decx: do you have anything for me?
[09:05:53] <decx> yes
[09:06:06] <decx> get done with the damn date picker stuff
[09:06:35] <hellyeah> actually question is different
[09:06:41] <hellyeah> :=p
[09:08:15] <noregret> decx: is this the right way? - https://dpaste.de/1aze
[09:08:27] <decx> yes
[09:08:43] <decx> for convenience you can chain prop directly
[09:08:57] <decx> it's only with append() that it doesn't chain
[09:09:16] <noregret> got it
[09:09:37] <noregret> decx: question, does the '$' do anything to a var name?
[09:09:54] <decx> some people prefer it to mark a variable as a jquery object
[09:10:13] <decx> i dont like it, gets confusing with php
[09:10:46] * hellyeah my question is not datepicker question
[09:10:49] <noregret> i see
[09:11:50] <Xatenev> decx: how does a javascript variable gets confusing with PHP?^^
[09:12:08] <decx> the variables there are $var
[09:12:33] <Xatenev> yea but its completly different context
[09:12:37] <Xatenev> how do you get "confused" there :O
[09:12:57] <decx> what?
[09:13:17] <decx> if i see $var i think php what's so hard to understand about that
[09:15:54] <hellyeah> Xatenev: pls help first i create element and add to body but in DatePickers function i couldnt execute .datepickers why did it happen? http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/29/
[09:16:32] <Xatenev> decx: w/e
[09:16:53] <Xatenev> hellyeah: dont know
[09:16:59] <hellyeah> :XD
[09:17:06] <Xatenev> I dont know the datepickers plugin
[09:18:36] <hellyeah> Xatenev: question is different
[09:18:44] <hellyeah> i create an element and add to body
[09:19:02] <hellyeah> i call datepickers in different function after creating one element
[09:19:07] <hellyeah> but it doesnt work

[09:40:25] <dolox> hi it is possible to sort a word list with jquery in a specific order ? I inverted the words in a list and I want my user replaces them in order to give a coherent sentence
[09:42:24] <decx> not really relevant to jquery and more of a general programming question
[09:42:56] <dolox> I thought jquery ui sortable
[09:43:29] <sharpy35> Hey guys
[09:43:50] <sharpy35> i have a question, is it possible with jquery datepicker to disable dates from a timespan?
[09:44:02] <sharpy35> i have couple of objects with dateFrom and dateTo props
[09:44:10] <sharpy35> and want to disable all dates in that range
[09:45:23] <shoky> sharpy35: yes. see the `beforeShowDay` option
[09:45:58] <decx> dolox: sortable will do fine yes but that seems to be only a smaller prat of what you are trying to do
[09:46:53] <sharpy35> can you give me an example shoky?
[09:47:06] <decx> google beforeshowday for lots
[09:47:21] <dolox> hmm how to check if one of my sentences begins with the right words?
[09:47:26] <dolox> regular expression ?
[09:47:39] <decx> depends on what you are trying to do
[09:47:57] <decx> like shuffle a sentence and have a puzzle where the user has to figure out the original sentence?
[09:48:32] <dolox> I have a phrase that the user must find with words that I give him the disorder and he must replace them to make the sentence
[09:49:27] <dolox> ex : word , hello ==> hello word ( just an example ^^ )
[09:49:40] <dolox> world *
[09:51:32] <shoky> sharpy35: https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/32c66zdq/
[09:52:32] <sharpy35> awesome
[09:52:37] <sharpy35> cheers
[09:52:41] <sharpy35> i will try that shoky
[09:52:44] <dolox> decx like that https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_5R-NtKnC8/maxresdefault.jpg
[09:53:26] <decx> take the sentence, split and shuffle, then on sortable stop you can compare your sortable text to your original sentence
[09:53:29] <decx> that should do it
[09:54:04] <hellyeah> when you create datepickers dates of range is shown in result datepicker with some colors but when you create second datepickers, date of range is not shown in result datepickers. How can i solve that? Pls help me out http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/31/
[09:54:48] <dolox> if the user makes a mistake , I want he can not put a bad word , so I have to check if the beginning of the sentence is good
[09:55:21] <decx> like i said, sortable is the least of your problems
[09:55:48] <dolox> how to check if a sentence beginning is good?
[09:56:11] <decx> you split your sentence first
[09:56:24] <decx> then you can compare the sentence fragments
[09:57:02] <slax0r> why not regex?
[09:57:19] <dolox> ok this is a way to make you think the regular expression are also good ?
[09:57:37] <decx> i dont see the need for it if you already deal with words as sentence fragmetns
[09:58:07] <slax0r> I didn't follow through what you're trying to achieve
[09:58:22] <slax0r> but braking up a string just to check something, seems like a job for a regex tho
[09:58:49] <decx> yeah but you already split the sentence into the fragments that are supposed to be sortable
[10:00:03] <dolox> thank you very much for the help , I'll go for a prototype :)
[10:01:18] <decx> first https://jsfiddle.net/decx/habjy7dn/

[11:26:28] <__marco> Hello. Does anyone experienced issues with jquery and browserify?
[11:27:49] <__marco> I have `var jQuery = require("jquery")` and if I do jQuery("#sel") or $("#sel") I got two different results
[11:28:20] <shoky> __marco if you called the var jQuery then you can only access it with `jQuery`
[11:28:41] <shoky> __marco  you can do  var $ = require("jquery");  or  like you have it and var $ = jQuery;  if you want
[11:29:47] <__marco> shoky: I said I did. This because of some black magic. (I actually use a cdn)
[11:30:03] <__marco> shoky: and $ works while jQuery doesn't
[11:30:09] <shoky> __marco: you said you did what?
[11:30:18] <__marco> I use $
[11:30:27] <shoky> __marco:  your variable name is $?
[11:30:38] <shoky> you said you did  `var jQuery = require("jquery")`
[11:31:33] <__marco> yes, but if I use jQuery, I got strange errors while with $ I don't
[11:32:03] <shoky> i don't know what code you're talking about when you say that. donno what you mean by "I use jQuery"
[11:32:24] <shoky> also.. what errors
[11:32:32] <shoky> show your code + the errors you're getting.
[11:45:42] <claytonzaugg> Is there a way to enable the ability to start typing in a select field using select2 without having to click the dropdown first?
[11:46:10] <robertmaxrees> could probably set focus on it.
[11:46:34] <robertmaxrees> like, focus by default.
[11:47:02] <claytonzaugg> Doesn't it set focus on it if you tab to it?
[11:47:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what problem you're describing, then.
[11:47:48] <robertmaxrees> tabbing to it doesn't work?
[11:47:53] <claytonzaugg> Okay check this
[11:48:11] <claytonzaugg> go here and tab to the first example, or the one that's select 2, so it's the second example https://select2.github.io/examples.html
[11:48:18] <claytonzaugg> try to start typing like California or another state
[11:48:23] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[11:48:27] <robertmaxrees> that's what you mean.
[11:49:03] <claytonzaugg> Why do you have to physically click the select drop down to trigger the type to find?
[11:49:10] <claytonzaugg> that's horrible workflow!
[11:49:14] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[11:49:19] <robertmaxrees> because it's a dropdown - that's what the user expects.
[11:49:37] <claytonzaugg> lol well damnit, that's not what I expect from Select2 which lets you search!
[11:49:41] <robertmaxrees> https://select2.github.io/examples.html#programmatic is what you want.
[11:49:44] <claytonzaugg> :)
[11:50:11] <claytonzaugg> YES!  Thank you robertmaxrees!
[11:50:16] <robertmaxrees> you could also munge in what you want by using https://select2.github.io/examples.html#multiple-max, but that's going to be confusing for your end users.
[11:50:39] <claytonzaugg> yeah I saw the multi one and confusion is exactly why I stayed clear
[11:50:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out the programmatic access first and go from there.
[11:50:55] <claytonzaugg> Yep, programmatic is what I'm looking for I think.  Thank you.
[11:57:56] <adavia> any idea what i am missing to match this input fields https://jsfiddle.net/hb7jkexn/2/
[11:58:15] <robertmaxrees> wut
[11:58:37] <robertmaxrees> ah.  trying to use a regex for the name field?
[11:59:08] <adavia> yes
[11:59:18] <robertmaxrees> what are you matching on?
[11:59:32] <Pazician> Hello. Why does .load() not refresh an image? I use this code, but it won't refresh the image itself, I look in the inspector and it's refreshing the HTML but the frames of the image is still there: https://pastee.org/w79qe
[11:59:32] <robertmaxrees> like, anyhing that contains 'file_demo'?
[11:59:46] <robertmaxrees> Pazician browser cache
[11:59:56] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: You sure?
[12:00:06] <Pazician> Since if I refresh the Page, then it refreshes
[12:00:10] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure. browsers are pretty aggressive about caching things.
[12:00:16] <robertmaxrees> i'd check headers.
[12:00:43] <robertmaxrees> adavia like, any reason you can't just use indexOf() here?
[12:00:45] <Pazician> I used the ajax function and set the cache to false, even then it was the same thing
[12:01:01] <robertmaxrees> dunno then - i'd have to see it.
[12:01:07] <adavia> robertmaxrees: anything that contains "file_demo" or "file_demo()" or "file_demo[asd][asd]"
[12:01:35] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Alright, weird. I'll try to figure it out
[12:02:39] <adavia> robertmaxrees: i am wondering why the regex works here https://jsfiddle.net/mrpL666u/4/ but not with the fields
[12:04:06] <mchu> for ajax, how do i check if the response received is a doc file (like file.jade)?
[12:05:54] <shoky> what's a doc file
[12:07:02] <mchu> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/w815g550/ if you look at the code after line 14, I only want to run line 15 if the response isnt a file (im trying to render that file is the condition is met)
[12:07:08] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: What I'm doing is I've an Raspberry Pi which takes some snapshots from my cam, I now I want to update the images every every second, hwo would you personally do it?
[12:08:26] <__marco> shoky: long story short, I was using jquery before including it but I did have a strange behavior instead of a "non defined" error
[12:09:00] <taplar> adavia: filter expects a true/false to be returned
[12:09:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/hb7jkexn/3/
[12:09:02] <shoky> mchu: are you asking about server code or client code? anyway the server responds with data (e.g. HTML)  not with a jade file (or any file).
[12:09:11] <shoky> mchu: so no idea what you're asking
[12:09:42] <shoky> mchu: on the client you can check the response body, and the response headers (e.g. Content-Type) and that's pretty much it
[12:10:05] <taplar> adavia: also you should probably move the regex outside of the filter, put it in a variable, and reuse it.
[12:10:15] <shoky> __marco: uh didn't understand, but, all good now?
[12:10:51] <adavia> taplar: but if you check there is not matching what it is suppose to match
[12:11:26] <robertmaxrees> adavia why not just use indexOf?
[12:11:46] <shoky> name.match doesn't return a boolean
[12:12:02] <robertmaxrees> not sure that, you're not even returning out of the filter.
[12:12:21] <mchu> shoky: you mind if i send you a shorter version of my code so its more detailed.
[12:12:29] <taplar> ah
[12:13:20] <__marco> shoky: yes :) sorry, I don't have the talent to explain myself
[12:13:28] <shoky> mchu: i don't mind. how would a shorter version be more detailed though? :P  anyway still didn't undersatnd what you're asking
[12:13:38] <adavia> robertmaxrees: how would you use indexOf in a case like this
[12:14:03] <taplar> docs say name.match returns null on no match
[12:14:39] <robertmaxrees> adavia first off, your match IS working.
[12:14:49] <robertmaxrees> but you need to return out of the callback for filter.
[12:14:59] <robertmaxrees> right now you're not returning anything, which is why you're not getting any results.
[12:15:11] <robertmaxrees> i was suggesting indexof because it's much simpler and easier to read imo.
[12:15:13] <shoky> taplar er true, tho i still prefer using regex.test(str) if i want a boolean
[12:15:19] <taplar> yeah
[12:15:24] <robertmaxrees> ^^ yeah
[12:15:30] <robertmaxrees> use regex.test() if you want a bool.
[12:15:56] <mchu> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/w815g550/   so iâ€™m running an ajax request, and on line 9, instead of rendering a new page it is .text the entire code to the current page
[12:15:57] <robertmaxrees> but you still need to return out of the callback.
[12:16:12] <mchu> shoky: i think it has something to do with preventDefault.. but im not sure
[12:16:14] <shoky> mchu: that's the same fiddle
[12:16:24] <mchu> https://jsfiddle.net/w815g550/2/
[12:16:42] <adavia> uf
[12:17:13] <robertmaxrees> mchu is your question about jade?
[12:17:15] <robertmaxrees> or about jquery?
[12:17:17] <mchu> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/w815g550/2/#&togetherjs=ToyF3QV3bo this might be better
[12:17:21] <mchu> robertmaxrees: jquery
[12:17:24] <shoky> mchu: "it is .text the entire code to the current page"  what does that mean
[12:17:33] <shoky> mchu: and what is the problem?
[12:17:57] <adavia> robertmaxrees: you mean like this https://jsfiddle.net/hb7jkexn/3/
[12:18:06] <shoky> ugh no , collab fiddles are just annoying
[12:18:11] <robertmaxrees> adavia that's one way.
[12:19:28] <mchu> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/w815g550/3/ okay. so pretty much on line 6, itâ€™s not rendering, it doing a .send instead of .render
[12:19:37] <adavia> robertmaxrees: still does not match.. it returns just user[file_demo] and user[file_demo][0][file]
[12:19:57] <mchu> shoky: and i think its because i dont have a conditional after line 26, and/or prevent Default is causing that issue
[12:20:03] <adavia> robertmaxrees: fails with user[file_demo(1i)]
[12:20:14] <taplar> so that would be an issue with the regex no?
[12:20:15] <shoky> mchu: WHAT ISSUE?
[12:20:26] <mchu> shoky: thats the issue?
[12:20:30] <mchu> shoky: itâ€™s not rending
[12:20:36] <shoky> it's doing a .send instead of a .render?  that's the issue?
[12:20:39] <mchu> shoky: rendering
[12:20:44] <shoky> then change it to do a render instead of a send.
[12:20:53] <shoky> what's not rendering?
[12:20:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hb7jkexn/4/ adavia so what's the issue here?
[12:21:02] <adavia> taplar: thats weird because i tested here like you showed me https://jsfiddle.net/mrpL666u/4/
[12:21:06] <mchu> shoky: it is .render, but its not working due to my JS
[12:21:21] <shoky> what's not working? what is happening? what do you expect to happen?
[12:21:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hb7jkexn/5 adavia is this what you want?
[12:22:13] <shoky> mchu: sorry just realized you said it about line 6 and not 4 where you actually have a .send
[12:22:33] <mchu> shoky: .render is not running on line 6, for some reason line 6 is sending over the response rather than rendering, iâ€™m expecting it to render
[12:22:39] <shoky> mchu: if your server is not rendering the jade properly then you have a serverside problem
[12:22:49] <shoky> and this is the wrong channel
[12:22:55] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[12:23:07] <mchu> shoky: if i remove preventDefault, then it renders but the first condition wont run properly
[12:23:26] <mchu> shoky: well im in this channel because i think its my Jquery that is wrong
[12:23:26] <adavia> robertmaxrees: well thats possible one way.. im still curious why the regex do not match user[file_demo(1i)] when it should
[12:23:34] <robertmaxrees> adavia dunno - it's regex.
[12:23:38] <taplar> lol
[12:23:39] <robertmaxrees> i avoid it as much as possible ;)
[12:23:52] <shoky> mchu: your jquery seems fine.
[12:23:59] <adavia> i have been the whole weekend dealing with regex
[12:24:03] <taplar> without a var thisIsWhatTheRegexShouldDo = ....; i get lost easily
[12:24:11] <Calinou> http://www.regexr.com/ :)
[12:24:12] <robertmaxrees> adavia there's a reason i avoid regex.
[12:24:57] <adavia> i would probably do it better as a guitar player
[12:25:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:26:33] <Uhkis> so that's why i know regex..
[12:26:55] <robertmaxrees> i know enough regex to get by, but my skills on guitar far outpace my skills with regex.
[12:26:56] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:27:30] <taplar> i can do regex.  but give me a long piece of it and ask me to figure out why it's not working.  gonna take a hot minute
[12:27:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:27:51] * shoky strums some character classes
[12:28:04] <Uhkis> i managed to solve the regex puzzle!
[12:28:46] <adavia> robertmaxrees: you play the guitar?
[12:28:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:28:57] <robertmaxrees> have for many years.
[12:29:06] <Uhkis> how many?
[12:29:37] <Uhkis> i think it was this regex puzzle http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2013/coinheist.com/rubik/a_regular_crossword/grid.pdf
[12:29:39] <robertmaxrees> 15 or 16 years
[12:29:58] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: me too!
[12:30:04] <adavia> damn thats a lot.. you should have clapton skills
[12:30:07] <shoky> me too ;p
[12:30:21] <robertmaxrees> hahahaa.
[12:30:23] <robertmaxrees> i prefer SRV ;)
[12:31:34] <PuruPuru> Hello.
[12:31:44] <robertmaxrees> hello
[12:31:47] <taplar> adavia: i'm an idiot.  adavia you could make that whole thing a little easier by giving those elements a common class
[12:31:47] <Uhkis> hi!
[12:31:54] <PuruPuru> I need a bit of help.
[12:32:08] <Uhkis> ask!
[12:32:10] <adavia> taplar: can you show me
[12:32:24] <PuruPuru> I want to receive a JSON from the URL to which i send an AJAX POST request
[12:32:43] <Uhkis> that's not a question
[12:32:48] <PuruPuru> so i've written request.done(msg){console.log(msg)} but msg shows empty
[12:33:04] <robertmaxrees> PuruPuru that means your server isn't repsonding with anything.
[12:33:15] <PuruPuru> i meant request.done (function(msg){console.log(msg)});
[12:33:29] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly the same thing.
[12:33:36] <robertmaxrees> same story.
[12:33:37] <Uhkis> PuruPuru: have you checked your browsers log for errors?
[12:33:48] <Uhkis> *console
[12:33:50] <taplar> adavia: https://jsfiddle.net/hb7jkexn/6/
[12:34:03] <PuruPuru> but before, when it was responding with nothing, it would use the request.fail function
[12:34:15] <robertmaxrees> PuruPuru right, that means you're giving it a valid response.
[12:34:18] <robertmaxrees> it's just empty.
[12:34:23] <robertmaxrees> fix your server :)
[12:34:37] <PuruPuru> I'm in production environment
[12:34:42] <PuruPuru> meant dev*
[12:34:58] <shoky> empty response can be valid or invalid, depending on dataType option and content-type response header
[12:35:14] <PuruPuru> i haven't sent a dataType, but I'm sending an image
[12:35:15] <robertmaxrees> PuruPuru so do you want it to fail or what?
[12:35:29] <robertmaxrees> you're basically just telling us what IS happening but not telling us what you want to have happen instead.
[12:35:29] <PuruPuru> No, i want to receive the same object i sent it initially
[12:35:52] <PuruPuru> I want to upload an image, and get it back.
[12:35:57] <taplar> kinda strange
[12:35:59] <robertmaxrees> uh, you already have the image.
[12:36:06] <robertmaxrees> why not just use it again?
[12:36:08] <shoky> also doesn't sound like json ?
[12:36:11] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[12:36:22] <PuruPuru> fair enough.
[12:36:26] <adavia> btw thanks for helping everyone
[12:37:58] <PuruPuru> hmm
[12:38:44] <PuruPuru> I just want to know what gets to my controller in the url
[12:38:55] <robertmaxrees> PuruPuru huh?
[12:39:01] <taplar> def not the image data
[12:39:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah i wouldn't do that.
[12:39:15] <PuruPuru> So, i want to upload images async mode
[12:39:23] <PuruPuru> and then get a response back
[12:39:27] <taplar> image data would be in a post body
[12:39:41] <robertmaxrees> you are getting a response back.
[12:39:47] <robertmaxrees> what would you prefer that response to be?
[12:40:00] <robertmaxrees> because it sounds like you need to fix your server - your JS is fine.
[12:40:15] <PuruPuru> Okay. So here's the thing.
[12:40:22] <PuruPuru> I'll give a bit of context.
[12:40:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:40:39] <robertmaxrees> if you're not getting back the response you want, it has nothing to do with your JS>
[12:40:45] <PuruPuru> I have a website project on which I'm working.
[12:40:58] <taplar> "collaboration"
[12:41:00] <PuruPuru> Where i want people to make a post and include images in their post.
[12:41:25] <taplar> i'm making it a running joke
[12:41:27] <robertmaxrees> taplar hahahah
[12:41:57] <PuruPuru> So the idea was to upload the images on my server and once you upload them you'd get back a response telling you how to include them, the link at which they are available on the net
[12:42:01] <PuruPuru> that's it.
[12:42:11] <robertmaxrees> PuruPuru great - you need to fix your server.
[12:42:12] <decx> so imgur
[12:42:20] <taplar> so have the response be the url
[12:42:26] <robertmaxrees> right
[12:42:38] <robertmaxrees> like, none of your questions have anything to do with jquery at this point.
[12:43:48] <PuruPuru> I don't know how to return the data i have sent
[12:44:12] <PuruPuru> Because I want to know what gets received on the other side, so i know how to write my code.
[12:44:31] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1) you don't want to return the data you've sent, you want to return the URL that the image will be at and 2) that has nothing to do with jquery :)
[12:44:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up a channel about the server-side language you're using.
[12:44:58] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, that's true
[12:46:13] <PuruPuru> i was just trying to figure it out by myself
[12:46:23] <robertmaxrees> sure, and that's great :)
[12:46:26] <PuruPuru> by finding a way to dump back the values i've sent :(
[12:46:37] <robertmaxrees> right, but that's not what you want
[12:46:41] <robertmaxrees> what server-side language are you using?
[12:46:43] <PuruPuru> no, that's not.
[12:46:52] <PuruPuru> PHP with some symfony in it
[12:47:12] <robertmaxrees> join #symfony
[12:47:17] <robertmaxrees> or ##php
[12:47:20] <robertmaxrees> or w/e
[12:47:21] <PuruPuru> yeah, i know
[12:47:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:47:49] <PuruPuru> I came here because i thought you know a way to return the same data you've sent and show it
[12:47:51] <PuruPuru> in some way
[12:48:04] <taplar> sure
[12:48:05] <PuruPuru> or some way to see what goes on in an async request
[12:48:13] <robertmaxrees> sure - open your network tab.
[12:48:20] <robertmaxrees> that's the client-side/jquery side of things.
[12:48:23] <taplar> ^
[12:48:30] <robertmaxrees> but the server-side is better asked in a channel dedicated to that side of things.
[12:48:39] <taplar> if you want to echo things there is a way to do that too, but that's not really what your after
[12:49:57] <PuruPuru> yeah, I'll just work my way through this
[12:50:09] <PuruPuru> It's really hard to work with no feedback from the app
[12:50:16] <PuruPuru> I like seeing the result.
[12:50:30] <robertmaxrees> then hit up the docs for your backend.
[12:50:34] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty easy to set up.
[12:50:43] <taplar> why not do some error_log()'ing until you get the response you want?
[12:50:48] <ThomQ> Hi all. n00bie to Jquery here. How do I use a jquery function within a javascript function?
[12:50:58] <robertmaxrees> ThomQ that sentence hurts my brain :)
[12:51:06] <PuruPuru> taplar, there are no errors to log
[12:51:08] <robertmaxrees> there's no such thing as a "jquery function" - it's all javascript.
[12:51:15] <robertmaxrees> ThomQ so could you clariofy what you want?
[12:51:18] <PuruPuru> jquery is javascript
[12:51:23] <ThomQ> heyy robert, hi. You helped me this morning too :)
[12:51:31] <taplar> you can use error_log to put data into an error log file, regardless of if they are errors or not
[12:51:38] <ThomQ> simple pastebin of what I? trying to do: http://pastebin.com/XQwN9hVF
[12:51:50] <robertmaxrees> that's how you do that.
[12:52:10] <ThomQ> So that Should work?
[12:52:12] <PuruPuru> Well, thanks for talking to you nice people
[12:52:13] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:52:19] <PuruPuru> I'm sorry that this was not jquery stuff
[12:52:32] <taplar> you should be.  seriously!
[12:52:34] <robertmaxrees> it's fine, just trying to get you the assistance you want faster :)
[12:52:34] <taplar> :s
[12:52:44] <PuruPuru> but, really, thank you. At least I know where to stop looking
[12:53:10] <PuruPuru> I was trying so hard to make this work, but it's probably harder than it is to make what i really want :D
[12:54:20] <taplar> "make this work, instead of what i want"
[12:54:27] <taplar> is really the point of confusion
[12:54:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:56:18] <ThomQ> thanks again Robert.. Again it was my own fault hehe
[12:56:26] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[12:57:15] <taplar> ThomQ: have you hit up learn.jquery.com ?
[12:57:41] <taplar> i hear they have nudy pics there.  you should check it out
[12:57:51] <ThomQ> lol
[12:58:05] <ThomQ> I learn new languages best by just doing.
[12:58:14] <taplar> just heresay though, so no guarentees
[12:58:16] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't a language.
[12:58:26] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a lot of basics surrounding the library.
[12:58:45] <robertmaxrees> there are some patterns that you'll pick up on super quick if you give the tutorial a runtrhoguh.
[12:58:50] <robertmaxrees> *runthrough
[12:59:37] <Uhkis> taplar: what?! and here i am reading api.jquery.com like a fool!
[13:00:02] <ThomQ> first line of 2nd paragraph in the very first tut: ¨One important thing to know is that jQuery is just a JavaScript library.¨
[13:00:08] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:00:19] <ThomQ> I should read it :D
[13:00:25] <taplar> meh, your not a noob.  you wouldn't see them anyway.  they got you all identified with cookies, sessionstorage, etc.
[13:01:06] <taplar> silverlight storage has you too
[13:01:10] <taplar> was trying to remember that one
[13:02:58] <ThomQ> reading up on it now, already noticed a few things that I should know
[13:03:04] <taplar> +1
[13:03:08] <robertmaxrees> exactly why we suggest you read it :)
[13:03:26] <ThomQ> what IDE you guys use btw? I´m not sure if I like Dreamweaver yet
[13:03:30] <taplar> ignorance may be bliss, but it's not productive
[13:03:31] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[13:03:38] <robertmaxrees> run away from dreamweaver.
[13:03:50] <taplar> we used to use eclipse, but now we're in intellij
[13:03:52] <shapshank> I just asked this in #javascript, but wanted to check with people, here...   Are  .trigger  and the execution of handlers provided to .on   synchronous?
[13:04:02] <robertmaxrees> shapshank yeah.
[13:04:04] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.
[13:04:10] <mchu> robertmaxrees: does prevent default causes .render to not work because you canâ€™t submit ?
[13:04:12] <robertmaxrees> shapshank the callbacks are, but not the code inside of the,m.
[13:04:23] <robertmaxrees> mchu i don't know - .render is a jade method.
[13:04:33] <mchu> robertmaxrees: render()
[13:04:36] <robertmaxrees> ThomQ i use sublime text and intellij.
[13:04:37] <mchu> robertmaxrees: js i mean sorry
[13:04:41] <robertmaxrees> mchu huh
[13:04:41] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:05:19] <ThomQ> I only used IntelliJ for android projects, love it though
[13:05:27] <mchu> robertmaxrees: i didnt mean to type .render instead render() which is a js method
[13:05:36] <ThomQ> I don´t know exactly why I´m using dreamweaver for this tbh
[13:05:38] <robertmaxrees> mchu uh, whut?
[13:05:41] <shapshank> Ok, cool.  I THINK that's what I'm after.     someone's using a trigger handler within a success callback from an ajax call.  That call has .then applied to it, and the function executed by the then depends upon the trigger handler having been executed already.
[13:05:52] <robertmaxrees> mchu render is not a js method.
[13:06:06] <robertmaxrees> shapshank huh?  code?
[13:06:09] <shapshank> I wanted to make certain that it wasn't just a coincidence that we'd seen the trigger handler having executed
[13:06:14] <shapshank> Yeah. One sec.
[13:06:17] <shapshank>  function triggeredEventHandler(aPayload) { /* does whatever */ }  someDocument.on("someEvent", triggeredEventHandler);  function successCallback(someData) {   someDocument.trigger("someEvent", somePayload); }  function anotherCallback(someData) {  /* does whatever */ }  jQueryAsyncAjaxCall(   successCallback).then(  anotherCallback);
[13:06:37] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:06:40] <robertmaxrees> in a bpaste or something.
[13:06:40] <mchu> robertmaxrees: woops. but .render is JS? iâ€™m only using it in js right now
[13:06:42] <robertmaxrees> that's unreadable.
[13:06:53] <robertmaxrees> mchu there's no native .render() method in js.
[13:07:03] <shapshank> Yes.  Sorry, let me try this over again (I'm sorry)
[13:07:05] <robertmaxrees> that's coming from somewhere else.
[13:07:22] <shapshank> function triggeredEventHandler(aPayload) { /* does whatever */ }
[13:07:30] <shapshank> someDocument.on("someEvent", triggeredEventHandler);
[13:07:39] <shapshank> function successCallback(someData) {   someDocument.trigger("someEvent", somePayload); }
[13:07:45] <shapshank> function anotherCallback(someData) {  /* does whatever */ }
[13:07:48] <shapshank> jQueryAsyncAjaxCall(   successCallback).then(  anotherCallback);
[13:07:51] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:07:52] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[13:07:56] <robertmaxrees> not in the channel at all.
[13:07:59] <robertmaxrees> paste in in a paste service.
[13:08:04] <robertmaxrees> like bpaste.
[13:08:09] <taplar> Paste code @ http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com
[13:08:15] <shapshank> yeah.  Sorry about that.  I'm herping every derp.
[13:08:20] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:14:04] <robertmaxrees> shapshank fwiw you already have deferreds.  i'd just use the deferreds instead of proxying logic through the document.
[13:14:35] <shapshank> Yeah, I know.  This isn't code I wrote, it just looked pretty convoluted.
[13:14:43] <shapshank> On the order of scary.
[13:14:48] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[13:14:55] <robertmaxrees> they just don't understand how deferreds work.
[13:14:57] <robertmaxrees> not scary at all.
[13:15:42] <shapshank> This thing's ripe with .on and .trigger  (it's actually a use of the PDFTron web viewer)
[13:16:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, some people view that as a great pub/sub mechanism.
[13:16:03] <shapshank> And that thing kicks out tons of events and bindings to documents and everything.
[13:16:06] <robertmaxrees> i've never been a big fan but meh.
[13:17:28] <shapshank> Similar sentiment, here.  lots of possibility for spaghetti code and secret moving parts.
[13:17:37] <robertmaxrees> eeexactly.
[13:18:18] <shapshank> This is compounded by the fact that this application runs in iframes, with communication between the iframe and the parent windows.
[13:18:28] <robertmaxrees> eep.
[13:18:29] <shapshank> PDFTron does similar stuff, too.
[13:18:41] <shapshank> And there's event bindings up and down the chain.
[13:19:10] <shapshank> Thanks for the input, robertmaxrees
[13:19:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely.
[13:19:33] <robertmaxrees> one of these days i'll write a sane pub/sub system.
[13:19:48] <shapshank> Haha.
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> i feel like there's a not crazy way to do it.
[13:22:44] <phelix_> I am using jquery tabs. For the controls there is an <a> tag  that it is using to move the slides along. However, I can't for the life of me figure out how to also get the functionality to progress the slides through another link. They are formed identical. Anyone have any pointers or any ideas on what could be happening?
[13:23:08] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[13:23:22] <robertmaxrees> or link to docs or anything else you can give us?
[13:24:29] <phelix_> Well, I can. one sec.
[13:31:05] <phelix_> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/1wqwcvnr/
[13:31:13] <phelix_> that is the js and html
[13:31:57] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[13:31:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:32:05] <robertmaxrees> give me more context here them.
[13:32:10] <robertmaxrees> *then
[13:32:53] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:39:13] <huck5> I'm calling $(...).empty() on a div that contains some jQuery Mobile UI elements - namely a textinput. After .empty() has run, there still remains an input-text within the selected container. The only change I can see is that it's jQuery UI styling has been removed.
[13:39:29] <huck5> Does anyone know the reason this isn't actually removing all elements from within the selected div?
[13:39:37] <huck5> selected = targeted**
[13:41:23] <huck5> Ah. Figured it out. Here's a link with explanation if anyone is interested https://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-empty-does-not-destroy-ui-widgets-whereas-jquery-remove-does-using-ui-1-8-4
[13:54:47] <printForever> Is there a way to submit regular HTML form to PHP file but get a response via AJAX?
[13:54:58] <taplar> no
[13:55:02] <printForever> taplar!
[13:55:20] <taplar> heh
[13:55:25] <printForever> you're the man I'm looking for
[13:55:29] <taplar> regular form submit is outside ajax
[13:55:31] <printForever> the love of my IT life
[13:55:36] <taplar> woah
[13:55:39] <phelix_> wb robertmaxrees: You still up for taking a look?
[13:56:09] <robertmaxrees> phelix kind of in the middle of stuff now.
[13:56:09] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[13:56:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up the docs of the thing you';re using.
[13:56:27] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like oyu want programmatic access to it.
[13:56:30] <phelix_> its just the jquery tabs function
[13:56:31] <printForever> taplar, I was looking for you, few days back, when I had some Select2 questions, on explaining how things work. robertmaxrees was kind to lend a hand but we didn't end up with a working model on how to find a solution.
[13:56:48] <phelix_> i just can't figure out where its binding the event to
[13:56:58] <taplar> ok?  i don't know much about select2
[13:57:15] <robertmaxrees> printForever did you ever read the documentation i suggested?
[13:57:31] <printForever> taplar you're leaps and bounds ahead of me anyway
[13:58:48] <printForever> taplar, I've read their documentation but I didn't fully understand what is what, and how does it works with the whole system. Documentation is there, and maybe to someone it makes sense, but for me it was too short and there weren't any examples on the topics I was interested in.
[13:59:15] <printForever> thank you robertmaxrees
[14:00:44] <taplar> maybe i should rephrase that.  my knowledge of select2 is pretty much zilch.
[14:01:27] <printForever> taplar - well, however zilch it might be, you helped me by writing few lines of code and thus creating CustomAdapter
[14:01:48] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing a pattern here.
[14:01:57] <printForever> thank you robertmaxrees
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep saying that?
[14:03:38] <printForever> taplar, so I was wondering if you can help me go over that CustomAdapter, not by coding, but rather as an explanation... Because I'm not able to find a way to configure that CustomAdapter with the set of options they offer. Also, some of the things haven't even been documented at all...
[14:05:52] <robertmaxrees> because a lot of what you're truing to do is modifying the non-public API of the plugin.
[14:07:41] <robertmaxrees> which means you're basically on your own :)
[14:09:24] <taplar> what did i help write?
[14:29:21] <huck5> Ok, still having this issue. Can't seem to recreate it on a jsFiddle either...
[14:29:52] <huck5> What's happening is that I call .empty() (or .children().remove()) on a div containing jQuery UI elements. jQuery UI textinput is not removed from the container..
[14:29:56] <huck5> any idea why this would be happening?
[14:30:40] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe you're not targeting the correct element.
[14:30:50] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you manually delete that element using your dev tools.
[14:30:55] <z1haze> can you change multiple css attributes in a single .css()?
[14:31:03] <huck5> robertmaxrees, by selecting it and calling .remove()?
[14:31:05] <robertmaxrees> z1haze yep - pass it an object.
[14:31:11] <robertmaxrees> huck5 by using your developer tools
[14:31:16] <robertmaxrees> right-clicking the node and deleting them,.
[14:31:23] <huck5> robertmaxrees, ah ok!
[14:31:30] <z1haze> alright, robertmaxrees can i also just chain them together? like .css().css()
[14:31:51] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you could, but I'd avoid that.
[14:32:03] <z1haze> well i only have 2 properties to change
[14:32:03] <huck5> robertmaxrees, it.. deletes just fine
[14:32:30] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i'd use the object still.
[14:32:36] <robertmaxrees> huck5 sounds like maybe a bad selector?
[14:32:37] <z1haze> ok
[14:32:41] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it it's hard to help.
[14:33:14] <huck5> robertmaxrees, ok, thanks! Yeah, I tried recreating on jsFiddle and it worked as I originally expected. What's happening now is that hte jQuery UI styling is removed (along with some divs), but the <input type='text'> element is still present
[14:34:45] <huck5> Must be something weird with the way it was created (likely dynamically with jQuery)... maybe if i refresh the container?
[14:34:53] <robertmaxrees> "refresh the container"?
[14:34:59] <robertmaxrees> can you share any of the code here?
[14:35:11] <robertmaxrees> some context would be nice.
[14:35:41] <huck5> robertmaxrees, yes definitely. I'll create a gist. Just one moment.
[14:39:12] <huck5> robertmaxrees, https://gist.github.com/Huck5/acca0e24e76b30238c50 . The function in the second file is where I'm calling .empty() / .children().remove(). But even ignoring that function (and just opening the popup and using jquery in console), it doesn't work how I expect.
[14:39:39] <robertmaxrees> aaaand you're 100% that ID is unique?
[14:39:55] <robertmaxrees> try $('[id=wrapperAttachmentName]').length
[14:39:58] <robertmaxrees> that do you get?
[14:40:05] <robertmaxrees> *what
[14:40:56] <huck5> yes, it is unique
[14:41:19] <robertmaxrees> so that code gives you 1?
[14:41:20] <huck5> returns `1`
[14:41:26] <robertmaxrees> can't use #wrapperAttachmentName
[14:41:56] <huck5> How come?
[14:42:42] <huck5> Oh, sorry.I see what you are saying. I used the [id= ... ] as you provided, and the function still returns 1
[14:43:49] <huck5> It's just weird... when I call `$("#wrapperAttachmentName").children().remove()`, the actual targeted div is removed as well...
[14:45:35] <robertmaxrees> you have another issue then.
[14:46:18] <huck5> Yeah, ok. Kinda figured. Thanks robertmaxrees!
[14:50:20] <frexo> hi how can JUST obtain the value during a drag and drop ?
[14:50:45] <robertmaxrees> the value of what?
[14:51:09] <frexo> of the draggable element
[14:51:16] <robertmaxrees> you mean the text?
[14:51:24] <frexo> yes :)
[14:51:46] <robertmaxrees> $(ui.draggable).text()
[14:52:30] <frexo> thanks
[14:55:28] <definity_> How could i make ti so my bricks land on top of each other? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/MKxxPj
[14:58:55] <robertmaxrees> definity_ probably need to recalculate the $groundy
[14:59:06] <robertmaxrees> or something.
[14:59:17] <robertmaxrees> TweenLite is where you want to look.
[15:01:30] <definity_> Yeah, i looked there but iom knew to this. I have been trying to do groundY =+ 10. but that isnt working
[15:38:41] <Sibert> Can someone help me with the .trigger() function?
[15:38:52] <bellez> hey guys, i'm having some issues with my jquery ui working. I am trying to implement it into a laravel project. I am just trying to get the simple select menu working and it will not look like it did before I downloaded the theme any idea why?
[15:38:57] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask - if you have a question, just ask it Sibert
[15:39:01] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[15:39:12] <robertmaxrees> bellez sounds like a CSS issue?
[15:39:45] <bellez> all i did was link the css file from the downloaded ui folder
[15:39:56] <robertmaxrees> and that changed the way things looked?
[15:40:57] <Sibert> My body has a onkeydown handler assigned, I need it triggered by jquery, so I tried .trigger() and it does trigger the handler, but upon inspection with console.debug, it seems to generate a mousevent instead of a keyboardevent
[15:41:53] <robertmaxrees> Sibert so triggering events is generally something to avoid.
[15:42:00] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't directly call the function you want?
[15:42:35] <bellez> http://kopy.io/spCLR this is my html file with the linked files
[15:42:55] <robertmaxrees> bellez right, so things are looking different now that you're including some new CSS files?
[15:43:43] <Sibert> Well it's kinda complicated, robertmaxrees. I'm developing for a smartTV, so the keypresses from the remote come in that way, but I want to be able to simulate those externally, so I want to trigger the eventhandler with the right 'event' data (eg data.keyCode)
[15:44:35] <robertmaxrees> Sibert that doesn't really tell me why you can't just call the logic directly instead of using trigger
[15:44:36] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:44:53] <Sibert> Because I have been unable to include the event daya
[15:44:55] <Sibert> data*
[15:45:01] <bellez> if i don't call the .selectmenu() in the main.js file, it looks normal like a normal select menu however when I try to do the $('select').selectmenu(); it goes all white and when click on the text, it opens up a ul
[15:45:06] <robertmaxrees> so what event data to do you need to include?
[15:45:14] <bellez> but i have it set up as select and options
[15:45:17] <robertmaxrees> Sibert the idea is that you don't need to rely on the event data if you abstract it out.
[15:45:31] <robertmaxrees> bellez so it sounds liek you're missing a css file or two.
[15:45:38] <Sibert> robertmaxrees, I need to be able to send the event.keyCode
[15:46:08] <robertmaxrees> Sibert i'd abstract it out and then manually send that info from the default handler and the thing you're trying to trigger from.
[15:46:20] <robertmaxrees> be a bit easier than trying to recreate the entire event object.
[15:46:51] <Sibert> hm
[15:47:00] <robertmaxrees> and much more readable IMO.
[15:47:03] <Sibert> so actually using extra arguments or what?
[15:47:32] <robertmaxrees> abstract out the logic and modify your current handler to call that function with whatever data it needs.
[15:47:42] <Sibert> oh
[15:47:43] <bellez> i just included all of the css files (well all the min ones) and still nothing is changing
[15:47:56] <robertmaxrees> bellez open your network tab - any 404's?
[15:48:27] <bellez> no
[15:49:01] <huck5> robertmaxrees, found a way around the issue... I unbound the `remove` event from the jQuery UI widget. Now it doesn't delete its' parent when I call .remove() on it. Hacky solution, as I'm sure there is an underlying problem, but works for now!
[15:49:50] <Sibert> robertmaxrees, I've found a solution
[15:49:53] <Sibert> it works
[15:50:08] <Sibert> I'm not too fond of it but it does the job :P
[15:50:10] <Sibert> thanks
[15:58:17] <Bugson> guys I'm new in js and jquery world so sorry for potentialy newbie question, in many places I've got the same anonymous function (for example with jquery filter) problem is that when I declare it above and invoke it it simply doesn't work as it can't, question is: is there some way to declare function which returns anonymous function declaration which can be used in jquery?
[15:58:45] <taplar> sure, but what are you actually trying?
[15:58:53] <taplar> can you give us a small example?
[15:59:08] <Bugson> taplar yes one sec please
[15:59:29] <taplar> preferably in a paste site like jsfiddle or others
[16:04:30] <Bugson> taplar: https://dpaste.de/HOpy
[16:05:15] <Bugson> taplar: parse_options is a funtion which I'd like to use in every filter in that code
[16:05:21] <taplar> so your talking about genericising the three change handlers?
[16:05:29] <taplar> oh
[16:05:57] <LyndsySimon> I'm doing something stupid. Can someone take a look at tell me why my "done" callback is not firing? http://pastebin.com/1Sk3fHga
[16:06:02] <Bugson> taplar: genericising is my second task for today ;)
[16:06:15] <LyndsySimon> The "always" callback fires, but neither the "done" nor the "fail" callbacks ever fire.
[16:06:18] <shapshank> robertmaxrees - Thanks again for your help earlier.
[16:06:46] <taplar> Bugson: so your saying parse_options isn't working how your using it?
[16:07:34] <Bugson> taplar: yes it's not, propably cause $(this) isn't reffering to correct this, but not sure
[16:07:49] <Bugson> taplar: when I use it as anonymous function it does work
[16:08:28] <taplar> change your method to be (index, element) and use element instead of 'this'
[16:08:55] <taplar> kinda strange though, i would have thought the this would have worked like that
[16:10:27] <taplar> btw, why are you cloning your options?
[16:10:41] <Bugson> hmm still no luck, I'll debug it
[16:11:00] <taplar> ah, nvm
[16:11:02] <Bugson> taplar: cause I'm overwriting them and I want to have original ones
[16:11:52] <LyndsySimon> Got it. I was assigning to request.done, when I should have been calling it.
[16:17:23] <Bugson> taplar: ok so ther's no need for using element as this works correctly, somehow the filter doesn't work as expected
[16:17:33] <Bugson> don't know why
[16:18:16] <taplar> oh
[16:18:21] <taplar> probably because of parent
[16:18:35] <taplar> it works when it is inline because it's defined
[16:18:43] <taplar> but it's not when you define your method outside
[16:18:56] <Bugson> ohh yeah :)
[16:19:51] <Bugson> thx taplar for your time
[16:20:17] <taplar> sure
[16:20:43] <taplar> btw if you wanted to you could change your wrapper to: jQuery(function($){ ...
[16:20:48] <taplar> and then you could use $ inside
[16:24:11] <Bugson> thx for the tip
[16:26:42] <mchu> is there such thing as something that stops the preventDefault after the ajax is called?
[16:27:11] <taplar> you could try, but there's a good chance the event has already moved on
[16:27:24] <taplar> or wait
[16:27:31] <taplar> 'stops the preventDefault'?
[16:27:52] <mchu> taplar: are you good with js?
[16:28:02] <mchu> taplar: maybe its easier if you can see the code
[16:28:03] <taplar> i have my moments, :)
[16:29:11] <mchu> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/kvhk75vh/4/   prevent default is causing line 44 not to load. there must be a different way to make this work :(
[16:29:55] <taplar> so don't do that?
[16:31:27] <taplar> how is saveRequest invoked?
[16:32:20] <mchu> what do you mean.
[16:32:41] <mchu> well theres a ton of more code to that . i just removed it becaues it doesnt affect the issue
[16:33:04] <taplar> your assigning a function to exports.saveRequest but I don't see that invoked
[16:33:17] <mchu> taplar: the main issue is between 40-44 and 21-26
[16:33:49] <taplar> i don't understand how that function is being executed
[16:33:51] <mchu> oh its invoked in some other codes but im not sure if i should show everything. its over 400 lines of code
[16:34:00] <taplar> k
[16:34:08] <taplar> so there's another submit handler that invokes that then?
[16:34:39] <mchu> i think so. what do u mean submit handler
[16:34:53] <taplar> $(...).on('submit', submitHandler);
[16:35:01] <mchu> no
[16:35:32] <mchu> taplar: thats the only one
[16:35:41] <taplar> so yeah, i don't understand how that preventDefault is stopping it then
[16:35:57] <taplar> since I don't see how it is being executed
[16:37:14] <mchu> when preventDefault isnâ€™t called, it renders a new page
[16:37:25] <taplar> right cause it's submitting
[16:37:29] <mchu> right
[16:37:57] <mchu> so now that it is calledâ€¦ itâ€™s stopping res.render to render (not being able to submit).. so how do i let it submit
[16:38:15] <mchu> taplar iâ€™m only using preventDefault to check if the cityzipState matches
[16:38:43] <mchu> taplar: and if it doesnt match, i send the response â€œinvalid cityâ€¦â€ which works perfectly
[16:38:43] <taplar> so you want to submit if they are valid?
[16:39:14] <mchu> but when itâ€™s valid.. instead of submitting and rendering a new pageâ€¦ it actually does the same exact thing as line 40.. it â€œappendsâ€ the entire html doc
[16:39:20] <taplar> you can submit the underlying form to bypass the submit handling
[16:39:28] <taplar> $form.get(0).submit()
[16:39:52] <mchu> where do u do that? mind if i make the jsfiddle a collaboration link?
[16:40:10] <taplar> i'd rather not.  you'd just do that once you know the inputs are valid, where ever that is.
[16:40:20] <taplar> probably in your success function i would guess
[16:40:42] <mchu> whats the (0)?
[16:40:56] <taplar> it gets the first underlying dom element
[16:43:17] <mchu> by putting that will it affect the first condition on line 40
[16:43:51] <Bugson> taplar: is there some way I can pas previous object to filter function? or any other way to pas parent over to filter function?
[16:44:39] <taplar> mchu: it shouldn't.  but again, i'm not sure how that second block is being executed
[16:46:06] <taplar> Bugson: you might just make it a global variable in the doc ready
[16:46:25] <taplar> since really only one select should be under going a change event at a given time
[16:47:38] <Bugson> taplar: ok I simply thought that there might more sophisticated way ;)
[16:48:17] <taplar> without recreating the function each time, not that i can think of
[16:48:33] <taplar> but you could go that route
[16:49:22] <Bugson> taplar: recreating?
[16:49:57] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/rky27w4k/
[16:50:33] <hlvwrk> hey so...
[16:50:33] <hlvwrk> https://jsfiddle.net/wjyaxoou/
[16:50:51] <hlvwrk> Is there a way to detect the event was a paste that caused the change?
[16:50:55] <taplar> nope
[16:50:57] <hlvwrk> >_>
[16:51:04] <mchu> taplar: so i think the form.get(0) is clicking submit tons of times. or something but its looping a ton
[16:51:20] <hlvwrk> How annoying. It isn't possible with jQ? Or not possible with JS at all?
[16:51:39] <Bugson> taplar: thx a lot that's exactly what I've been looking for, function that returns function ;)
[16:51:45] <taplar> you'd have to do something with catching key presses and see if ctrl and v are triggered at any time
[16:52:00] <hlvwrk> but paste can be triggered by rightclick/paste
[16:52:00] <NoiseEee> (which would miss right-click 'paste' of course)
[16:52:02] <taplar> and then figure out how you want to handle if they change the value after that
[16:52:03] <hlvwrk> yea
[16:52:06] <taplar> ^^^^^
[16:52:08] <hlvwrk> but there's a paste event
[16:52:10] <hlvwrk> o_O
[16:52:25] <hlvwrk> what is the paste event sniffing?
[16:52:35] <taplar> there's a paste event?
[16:52:45] <hlvwrk> Yes..
[16:52:55] <NoiseEee> hlvwrk: uh so it works?
[16:53:10] <hlvwrk> trying to combine functions for my change and paste
[16:53:16] <hlvwrk> <_<
[16:53:18] <taplar> 'change paste' ?
[16:53:38] <taplar> need to look this up.  is that a jquery ui event?
[16:54:15] <taplar> well dang
[16:54:19] <hlvwrk> lol
[16:54:44] <hlvwrk> I could do it that way, I was trying to throw it all under 'change' because paste triggers a change already...
[16:54:54] <NoiseEee> no
[16:55:01] <NoiseEee> events are for people to do, not programs
[16:55:09] <hlvwrk> >:/
[16:55:10] <NoiseEee> but certainly https://jsfiddle.net/wjyaxoou/1/ works so?
[16:55:26] <hlvwrk> yes this works
[16:55:33] <hlvwrk> That's not what I'm trying to do though.
[16:55:34] <hlvwrk> se.
[16:55:40] <hlvwrk> sec*
[16:55:47] <NoiseEee> https://jsfiddle.net/wjyaxoou/2/ @ hlvwrk then?
[16:56:26] <hlvwrk> https://jsfiddle.net/wjyaxoou/3/
[16:56:40] <hlvwrk> I have a paste-specific function
[16:56:44] <hlvwrk> and a change specific function
[16:56:49] <NoiseEee> why are you testing this with a button?
[16:56:55] <hlvwrk> one sec
[16:56:55] <NoiseEee> a button cannot change nor be pasted into
[16:56:59] <hlvwrk> I know. Bad example
[16:57:00] <hlvwrk> lol
[16:57:09] <taplar> it doesn't seem like the value is updated with the paste event
[16:57:16] <hlvwrk> https://jsfiddle.net/wjyaxoou/4/
[16:57:41] <hlvwrk> change isn't even working now. hmph
[16:57:48] <NoiseEee> hlvwrk: so just track that something's been pasted so it doesn'
[16:57:57] <NoiseEee> so it doesn't also fire a 'change' when you click away after the paste
[16:58:12] <hlvwrk> yeah that's what I'm doing now. just thought there'd be a cleaner way
[17:00:07] <taplar> interesting.  the value of the field on a paste event is the prior value before the paste is applied
[17:00:34] <NoiseEee> taplar: handy!
[17:00:38] <hlvwrk> yeah you have to timeout the function with a 0
[17:00:40] <hlvwrk> kinda hacky
[17:02:16] <taplar> i'd have thought it would give the new value though
[17:02:31] <taplar> i guess, what would you use it for then?  just to cancel it to prevent pasting?
[17:09:17] * taplar logs that away in his js toolbox
[18:37:25] <bellez> I have a question, how do i detect the change in a select field? I have tried .on('change') but it isnt working.
[18:38:30] <robertmaxrees> are you adding the change dynamically?
[18:38:34] <robertmaxrees> because that's what you do.
[18:39:45] <bellez> here is my jquery file
[18:39:48] <bellez> http://kopy.io/jHHws
[18:40:03] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[19:28:22] <bellez> can someone see why my code isn't working? https://jsfiddle.net/tymg92b8/
[19:31:39] <shoky> bellez you might wanna include jquery
[19:32:21] <bellez> i have it on my system. and still not working ;(

[19:37:47] <printForever> when using AJAX POST for submiting a form
[19:37:59] <printForever> the address bar in the browser is updated with the string from the form
[19:38:05] <printForever> can that be avoided?
[19:39:02] <printForever> I get something like this content.html?msf_year=&msf_nameorcompany=Hello+World&msf_email=helloworld%40gmail.com
[19:42:19] <printForever> fixed with e.preventDefault();
[20:12:23] <hlvwrk> hey, question. on keyup, if I'm trying to get the current element, what's the best way to prevent it from getting the element I tab down from?
[20:13:18] <hlvwrk> (example) [form element A], I tab into A, current element is A. I tab to element B, and current element should turn to B, but the event is firing before the change or something causing it to see the previously selected el
[20:14:11] <hlvwrk> prolly a timeout?
[20:15:27] <shoky> hlvwrk: use focus instead of keyup ?
[20:16:10] <hlvwrk> hmph
[20:16:27] <hlvwrk> So I'm binding multiple events (keyup, keydown, change, and paste) to a single function
[20:16:28] <shoky> if you just want to sometime get the current active element, you can use document.activeElement
[20:16:31] <hlvwrk> because all need to
[20:16:51] <hlvwrk> is that different than currentTarget
[20:17:15] <shoky> it has nothing to do with currentTarget. it's not related to any event
[20:17:27] <hlvwrk> hmph
[20:17:30] <hlvwrk> alright
[20:17:51] <hlvwrk> I'd jsfiddle this shit but figured my words my do me justice
[20:17:54] <hlvwrk> I think that makes sense
[20:17:55] <hlvwrk> one sec.
[20:48:45] <z1haze> i am trying to make a modal pop up by using a data attribute and adding a show class. http://dpaste.com/2A65XBZ this is what i currently have, it just feels messy , but it works. any suggestions?
[20:49:11] <z1haze> the button the user clicks has a data-modal attr that corresponds with the id of the modal
[21:14:37] <xenaxon> hi
[21:15:16] <xenaxon> I am having this problem: Error: Mismatched anonymous define() module:
[21:15:34] <xenaxon> with the jquery.cookie plugin
[21:15:42] <xenaxon> can anyone help me?
[21:15:58] <Rafaga2k> Good evening, theres any way to monitor the focus over elements that doesn't implemente Focus/blur events like DIV's ?
[21:28:34] <jalnt> Rafaga2k: What do you mean by focus in this case?
[21:29:02] <jalnt> Rafaga2k: What would a "focus" event on a div look like?
[21:29:22] <xenaxon> I am having this problem: Error: Mismatched anonymous define() module:
[21:34:44] <Rafaga2k> mouse click on a div and then lose focus on other element
[21:35:08] <Rafaga2k> making a click on another div
[21:35:39] <aro> is there a way to detect a reload of an iframe
[21:36:20] <Rafaga2k> what i'm trying to do is make a div clickable to show a context menu, but i having problem dismissing because DIV's doesn't implement focusout() or blur()
[21:37:59] <jalnt> So this context menu, it's a separate element to the div right?
[21:39:12] <Rafaga2k> yes, another div with display:none position:absolute
[21:39:24] <Rafaga2k> on click show on mouse coordinates
[21:40:22] <Rafaga2k> if i click an element inside div is dismissing it but i need to cover the focusOut/blur event on source element
[21:42:09] <jalnt> is it possible to post your code?
[21:42:22] <Rafaga2k> obviously blur only applies on form inputs
[21:44:28] <Rafaga2k> jantl: javascript only or full HTML, CSS and Javascript
[21:47:10] <jalnt> Rafaga2k: How many lines of each is there?
[21:47:42] <jalnt> If there is hundreds or thousands of lines, could you just post the part of the code you're having trouble with>
[21:49:09] <Rafaga2k> ok ...
[21:49:14] <Rafaga2k> working on it
[21:49:58] <jalnt> just the part of the HTML you're having trouble with would be a good start
[21:50:11] <jalnt> so I can see the elements you're working with
[21:57:32] <shoky> Rafaga2k you can do this each time you show the menu: $(document).one('click', function() { .. dismiss menu .. });   and on the menu you should do .on('click', function(e) { .. e.stopPropagation() .. }) so it doesn't bubble up
[21:58:24] <shoky> Rafaga2k: there's an example of that here, when you click the down-arrow button  http://jqueryui.com/button/#splitbutton
[22:00:13] <shoky> er i mean do .on('click' on the clickable div, not the menu
[22:12:14] <xenaxon>  I am having this problem: Error: Mismatched anonymous define() module:
[22:12:21] <xenaxon> with the jquery.cookie plugin
[22:12:31] <xenaxon> does anyone have any idea what's wrong?
[22:12:37] <xenaxon> sometimes it shows sometimes it doesn't..
[22:19:20] <Rafaga2k> ipv6 wow
[22:19:23] <jalnt> xenaxon: Are you using require.js?
[22:19:31] <xenaxon> yes
[22:19:34] <xenaxon> why
[22:20:16] <jalnt> xenaxon: http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html

[22:21:57] <xenaxon> jalnt: the script that is causing this is the jquery.cookie plugin

[22:29:47] <aro> is there a way to detect a reload of an iframe?
[22:30:01] <aro> because the $('#iframeId').load(function() { } );
[22:30:04] <aro> fires on page laod
[22:30:15] <aro> i want it to NOT fire on initial page load, but on subsequent changes
[22:30:18] <aro> is that possible?
[22:31:36] <Rafaga2k> aro make a global variable something like isFirstLoad = true and then on the first load on the event you change it to false and if is false then execute all the rest of the code
[22:31:52] <aro> ok
[22:31:54] <aro> thanks
[22:32:16] <Rafaga2k> aro: np
