[00:53:16] <Qalqi> i get a parseerror for an asynchronus request even though it returns a valid datatype
[00:53:51] <Qalqi> it gives error even for {"1": 1, "2": 2}
[01:31:13] <Qalqi> is it wrong if i get jqxhr object asObject { readyState=4, responseText="{"fontfactor": 19, "fla...likes": null, "id": 60}", status=200, more...}
[01:31:21] <Qalqi> i am getting parse erroe
[01:31:37] <Qalqi> error* and cant make what is screwing the code
[01:34:06] <Wiggin> the quotes may be screwing it up
[01:34:14] <Wiggin> use single quotes?
[01:42:13] <Wiggin> yo Qalqi
[01:42:57] <Qalqi> even when I put single quotes i get o/p in double quotes
[01:43:16] <Wiggin> o/p?
[01:43:23] <Qalqi> that json was generated by python print simplejson.dumps(data)
[01:43:30] <Hopsy> http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/430534_2899400532620_1488619798_32406878_985294669_n.jpg
[01:43:41] <Wiggin> lolwut
[01:44:26] <Qalqi> http://dpaste.com/731994/ this python code generated the json
[01:44:45] <Qalqi> i dunno if the error is on python code or in jquery code
[01:45:27] <lvh> Hello
[01:45:38] <Wiggin> hi
[01:45:43] <lvh> I'm trying to find a human date parser; ie something that will tell me a date was "3 days ago" or something
[01:45:56] <Wiggin> haha I'm reading the simplejson docs
[01:46:02] <Wiggin> but it shouldn't be a python problem
[01:46:21] <lvh> I found http://easydate.parshap.com/ but it's pretty old (same with Humane-Dates) so I was wondering if there's something new and fancy I should use
[01:46:53] <Wiggin> There's not much that can change
[01:47:09] <Wiggin> (What new and fancy thing can they even add?)
[01:48:49] <lvh> Wiggin: jQuery compatibility
[01:49:01] <Wiggin> nyeh try it an see
[01:49:29] <Wiggin> but there shouldn't be much that is borked, since it probably doesn't depend on anything more elaborate than html()
[01:50:02] <lvh> Wiggin: it also attaches event listeners, so it might use deprecated or inefficient APIs for that -- easy enough to fix, too I guess
[01:50:13] <Wiggin> it does?
[01:50:16] <Wiggin> huh
[01:50:26] <Wiggin> ah I see
[01:50:31] <lvh> Wiggin: Yes, it can watch an element for changes so it live-updates.
[01:51:44] <Wiggin> well
[01:51:47] <Wiggin> try it and see :P
[01:51:57] <Wiggin> the top result on google (should) be the most appropriate
[01:52:11] <lvh> I don't even know what I'm googling for.
[01:52:24] <lvh> I can come up with several ways of describing it, that give different top results.
[01:53:11] <Wiggin> ah
[01:53:40] <Wiggin> https://github.com/zachleat/Humane-Dates
[01:53:43] <Wiggin> 4 months ago
[01:54:51] <lvh> Wiggin: irrelevant changes 4m ago ;)
[01:54:59] <lvh> momentjs also does what I want
[01:55:04] <Wiggin> well maybe because there aren't any relevant changes heh
[01:55:45] <Wiggin> Qalqi
[01:55:46] <Wiggin> uhm
[01:56:01] <Wiggin> Parse error should definitely refer to the json bit
[01:56:06] <Qalqi> its working, pal
[01:56:08] <Wiggin> oh
[01:56:08] <Qalqi> hmm
[01:56:09] <Wiggin> derp
[01:56:10] <Wiggin> okay
[01:56:11] <Qalqi> thanks
[02:06:38] <ParanoidGal> Anyone see a reason the jquery slider on here would fade as a whole on the third rotation http://www.eliasentertainment.net
[02:08:09] <Wiggin> there's a slider?
[02:09:27] <ParanoidGal> The image element
[02:09:56] <ParanoidGal> Sorry wasn't too clear Wiggin
[02:10:12] <Wiggin> It's…still not very clear
[02:10:47] <ParanoidGal> Can you see the images on the pages with arrows to the left and right?
[02:10:53] <Wiggin> mmhmm?
[02:11:09] <Wiggin> give me an id or something
[02:11:56] <ParanoidGal> Now I'm confused what do you mean by an id?
[02:12:40] <Wiggin> which element are you referring to?
[02:12:45] <Wiggin> there are a lot of image elements ._.
[02:14:34] <ParanoidGal> Oh the client is saying all images fade on the third rotation. Looking at a video they sent it looks like some opacity issue
[02:14:41] <ParanoidGal> but I can't regret it anywhere
[02:14:58] <ParanoidGal> recreate it even
[02:15:30] <Wiggin> nope
[02:15:32] <Wiggin> not seeing it
[02:15:48] <Wiggin> OS X firefox 11
[02:16:18] <ParanoidGal> That's exactly where they are seeing the issue. Let me see if I can get the video up somewhere
[02:17:20] <Wiggin> oh wow it's a lot smoother in chrome :P
[02:18:50] <ParanoidGal> Yes it is. It's a bought in plugin that the client wanted used
[02:23:06] <ParanoidGal> Wiggin this is what they're seeing http://www.twitvid.com/IIIOE
[02:23:50] <Wiggin> HAHAHAHA
[02:24:00] <Wiggin> They're accidentally selecting the pictures
[02:24:10] <Wiggin> their selection color just happens to be yellowish
[02:25:37] <Wiggin> I'm almost certain that's their problem, because I got it too :P
[02:25:47] <Wiggin> I just didn't think anything of it
[02:26:18] <ParanoidGal> I never even thought of that!!
[02:26:57] <ParanoidGal> Is there anyway I set the selection color to transparent for that section?
[02:27:50] <Wiggin> uhm
[02:27:58] <Wiggin> it's an option in the OS settings
[02:28:00] <Wiggin> so I doubt it
[02:28:12] <ParanoidGal> If it is selection why does it only happen on 3rd rotation though?
[02:28:20] <ParanoidGal> Yeah thought as much ;)
[02:28:29] <Wiggin> you could try making everything unselectable
[02:28:32] <Wiggin> or just the images
[02:28:36] <Wiggin> not sure if it would work, though
[02:28:40] <Wiggin> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2744631/making-an-element-unselectable-using-jquery
[02:29:36] <ParanoidGal> Worth a try at least. Client is self confessed technophobe so kind of need to make it foolproof if I want complaints to stop
[02:30:06] <Wiggin> heh
[02:30:13] <Wiggin> but who would scroll through it three times?
[02:30:28] <ParanoidGal> My client apparently ;)
[02:30:47] <ParanoidGal> But valid point I may use that argument with them!
[02:32:17] <StevenCodes> yo guys lets say I want to make a sprite follow the mouse in the background of the page, doable ?
[02:32:32] <Wiggin> yeah
[02:32:42] <Wiggin> uhm
[02:33:01] <poppiez> any way to determine the amount of active post requests? I want to alert the user when leaving the website if no POST requests are running
[02:33:13] <poppiez> minus "no"
[02:34:00] <Wiggin> StevenCodes if it's in the background image, change the background-position attributes to match the mouse's X and Y coordinates when onmousemoves fires on body
[02:34:24] <Wiggin> poppiez: just have a counter that increments when you make a request and decrements when a request completes? ;)
[02:34:32] <StevenCodes> alright now how would I go about making the animation follow it correctly
[02:34:56] <Wiggin> uhm
[02:35:09] <poppiez> Wiggin: yeah but what about the POST type?
[02:35:18] <Wiggin> ?
[02:35:29] <Wiggin> poppiez: what do you mean POST type?
[02:35:49] <poppiez> Wiggin: I mean, I only want to count POST requests
[02:36:13] <ParanoidGal> Thanks for all your input Wiggin you're a star
[02:36:25] <Wiggin> haha you're welcome
[02:36:38] <Wiggin> and poppiez only increment the counter when you're making POST requests?
[02:36:40] <Wiggin> o.o
[02:36:50] <Wiggin> decrement it in the callback for those requests
[02:37:17] <Wiggin> StevenCodes: something like this? http://javascript.about.com/library/blfollow1.htm
[02:37:19] <Wiggin> google is your friend
[02:38:50] <StevenCodes> yeah but what i want has a shadow its a ball that moves and the tail turns the way the mouse is heading eh nvm
[02:39:35] <Wiggin> huh
[02:39:39] <Wiggin> it's possible
[02:39:50] <Wiggin> but a little complex
[02:40:03] <StevenCodes> yeah lol
[02:40:47] <ginsun> ugh, does anyone know what the "macosx timemachine" animation is called? I'm trying to find a jquery solution on google but don't know what to google for
[02:40:48] <Wiggin> okay you're probably going to want to use draggable in jqueryui
[02:40:53] <Wiggin> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[02:41:30] <Wiggin> ginsun: the window-going-forward-and-backwards animation?
[02:41:46] <ginsun> Wiggin: exactly!
[02:44:39] <ginsun> Wiggin: I'd be able to figure out the math myself, but I don't know what kind of a widget I could use etc.
[02:44:41] <Wiggin> hmmm
[02:44:48] <Wiggin> it's not a lot of math, actually
[02:45:11] <Wiggin> if you have a couple of divs just position them in order and animate() accordingly
[02:45:18] <Wiggin> widget?
[02:45:27] <Wiggin> and yeah I couldn't find any plugin ><
[02:47:22] <Wiggin> woah wow searching I stumbled on this http://www.interactivepixel.net/stackGallery/content/index.html
[02:47:23] <Wiggin> pretty cool
[02:48:22] <Wiggin> oh wait
[02:48:36] <Wiggin> here you go, ginsun http://www.eyecon.ro/spacegallery/
[02:50:00] <ginsun> Wiggin: awesome! thanks for your help!!!
[02:50:18] <Wiggin> mmh welcome
[02:54:12] <poppiez> Wiggin: like this: http://pastie.org/private/swwggis2tbyxl0nixgyuq
[02:54:13] <poppiez> ?
[02:56:54] <Wiggin> uh
[02:57:49] <Wiggin> yeah should be
[02:58:58] <Wiggin> remember to declare activePOST as 0 ;)
[02:59:20] <Wiggin> I always make this kind of mistakes
[03:00:21] <poppiez> Wiggin: yeah, it's already 0 but I do too :D
[03:03:27] <lvh> Does anyone know a human date thing that autoupdates and supports <time datetime="...">human readable</time> tags?
[03:03:38] <lvh> EasyTime doesn't do the latter. Humane dates doesn't do the former.
[03:04:39] <Wiggin> huh
[03:04:53] <Wiggin> if they provide the source, it should be simple enough to modify
[03:05:05] <lvh> I'm trying to not reinvent the wheel.
[03:05:11] <lvh> And intelligently redrawing isn't trivial.
[03:05:17] <Wiggin> alternatively just call Humane dates at predetermined intervals
[03:05:32] <Wiggin> heh
[03:44:03] <Munger> I was just reading  http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring . Under the heading 'Data', I notice this line --  var $this = $(this), data = $this.data('tooltip');  -- Can somebody please break this down a bit or me? I can't quite make sense of the syntax
[03:45:02] <Munger> Specifically the comma after $(this) doesn't seem to make sense to me
[03:47:50] <rawfael> hello
[03:48:00] <rawfael> can anyone help me?
[03:48:37] <rawfael> how can I change the URL without reload the page and without #
[03:48:47] <rawfael> like google plus and pinterest do
[03:49:11] <Munger> Is $(this) in that context doing mething subtle?
[03:49:21] <rawfael> what is the technology behind it? javascript?
[03:49:38] <ThiefMaster> html5 history api
[03:49:52] <ThiefMaster> since it's not supported in older browsers you'll want to use something like https://github.com/balupton/History.js
[03:50:17] <rawfael> ThiefMaster thank you =D
[03:50:42] <rawfael> what this History.js do? did it use # for retrocompatibility?
[03:51:26] <rawfael> did it use # for backward compatibility?
[03:52:11] <rawfael> yes... they use, I see in the readme, thanks
[03:54:00] <Wiggin> Munger
[03:54:08] <Wiggin> It's just declaring multiple variables
[03:54:22] <Wiggin> like var a,b,c,d,e;
[03:56:04] <Wiggin> congrats
[03:56:22] <Wiggin> on successfully joining the chatroom :P
[03:58:44] <sneakyness> @_@
[03:59:05] <dabear> 0o
[03:59:36] <Munger> Wiggin, Of course, I see it now. I got lost in parentheses :-)
[03:59:53] <sneakyness> @_@
[04:00:25] <Wiggin> ಠ_ಠ
[04:34:29] <Matt`> anyone know if something already exists which shows all the hours/days of a week and allows you to highlight hours by just clicking and dragging across a time period?

[05:30:58] <esaias> tehlulz : doesnt seem to work :/
[05:33:09] <esaias> https://gist.github.com/e5753a078f3779e71555 seems not to work thats how i wrote it now
[05:33:25] <esaias> still shows it
[05:33:40] <tehlulz> let me have a play
[05:33:41] <tehlulz> sec
[05:34:38] <tehlulz> $(document).
[05:34:42] <tehlulz> that is spelt incorrectly
[05:34:51] <tehlulz> fix the spelling on document
[05:34:52] <tehlulz> and it works
[05:35:42] <Hopsy> tehlulz: how can a variable be not defined in a variable, when it is defined :S
[05:36:02] <tehlulz> Hopsy, what do you mean?
[05:36:35] <Hopsy> tehlulz: I got this: function callFunction(httpChannel) { console.log(httpChannel.requestMethod);
[05:36:41] <Hopsy> and it does work
[05:36:48] <Hopsy> now I change consolelog in
[05:37:07] <Hopsy> var sendMessage = 'document.defaultView.postMessage(httpChannel.requestMethod, "*");';  y({ contentScript: sendMessage });
[05:37:19] <Hopsy> and I got errors that httpChannel is not defined

[05:39:22] <tehlulz> because its a string
[05:39:36] <tehlulz> var sendMessage = 'document.defaultView.postMessage(httpChannel.requestMethod, "*");';
[05:39:38] <tehlulz> try
[05:39:42] <tehlulz> var sendMessage = document.defaultView.postMessage(httpChannel.requestMethod, "*");
[05:41:01] <esaias> thx tehlulz now works like a charm :) thank you!
[05:41:07] <tehlulz> np
[05:41:48] <Hopsy> no tehlulz
[05:41:57] <Hopsy> doesnt work either
[05:42:35] <tehlulz> oh
[05:42:36] <tehlulz> derp
[05:42:41] <tehlulz> because its not defined
[05:42:53] <tehlulz> function callFunction(httpChannel) { console.log(httpChannel.requestMethod);
[05:42:55] <tehlulz> see
[05:43:05] <tehlulz> you're declaring the variable httpChannel as the argument for that function
[05:43:07] <Hopsy> then its work
[05:43:07] <_helpPlz_> hi is there any way to check if any ajax request is going on? if a js is included admist a ajax query how can i check? $.ajaxComplete() ?
[05:43:12] <tehlulz> so when you go
[05:43:18] <tehlulz> callFunction("asdf");
[05:43:27] <tehlulz> httpChannel inside that variable is called asdf
[05:43:38] <Hopsy> yes
[05:43:38] <tehlulz> but
[05:43:42] <tehlulz> outside that function
[05:43:43] <tehlulz> its undefined
[05:43:49] <Hopsy> indeed
[05:43:55] <tehlulz> with your second code
[05:43:56] <Hopsy> but it was inside :p
[05:44:03] <tehlulz> can you repost that second bit
[05:44:07] <tehlulz> i accidently left room
[05:44:53] <Hopsy> http://gyazo.com/43ba3ed6620b68c54297b5d52c1698c9.png?1334493580
[05:45:05] <Hopsy> function callFunction(httpChannel) {
[05:45:10] <Hopsy> var sendMessage = 'document.defaultView.postMessage(httpChannel.requestMethod, "*");';
[05:45:15] <Hopsy> y({ contentScript: sendMessage });
[05:45:18] <Hopsy> }
[05:45:28] <tehlulz> ohh
[05:45:30] <tehlulz> sorry
[05:45:41] <Hopsy> now it fails because it isnt defined
[05:45:58] <Hopsy> when the console.log is higer, it does work :S
[05:46:11] <tehlulz> how are you calling the callFunction
[05:46:22] <Hopsy> callFunction(httpChannel);
[05:46:57] <tehlulz> so before that
[05:47:03] <tehlulz> where have you declared httpChannel ;)
[05:47:05] <Hopsy> tehlulz: http://gyazo.com/35238d37c567c7272f8d248b8b16ae6e.png?1334493707
[05:47:21] <Hopsy> var observerService = components.classes["@mozilla.org/observer-service;1"].getService(Ci.nsIObserverService);
[05:47:28] <Hopsy> observerService.addObserver(httpRequestLogger, "http-on-modify-request", false);
[05:47:42] <tehlulz> ah
[05:47:44] <tehlulz> hmm
[05:47:46] <tehlulz> that should work
[05:47:47] <tehlulz> :/
[05:47:52] <Hopsy> its a firefox addon
[05:48:50] <tehlulz> can you do
[05:48:55] <tehlulz> console.log(subject);
[05:49:42] <Hopsy> info: [xpconnect wrapped nsIHttpChannel]

[05:54:32] <Hopsy> tehlulz: It works
[05:54:38] <Hopsy> it was the quotes!
[05:54:41] <tehlulz> ha!
[05:54:46] <Hopsy> I didnt had quotes
[05:54:47] <tehlulz> Which was what I first said :P
[05:54:56] <tehlulz> i think
[05:54:59] <tehlulz> na wasnt giving up
[05:55:02] <tehlulz> scratching my head
[05:55:03] <tehlulz> haha
[05:55:05] <tehlulz> gj
[05:55:06] <tehlulz> :)
[05:55:12] <Hopsy> haha
[06:01:06] <Hopsy> tehlulz: this is how it looks like: http://gyazo.com/472a9a6756b06f9b9a4e38b3cc78e192.png?1334494081
[06:01:15] <Hopsy> soo, when I visit any website
[06:01:25] <Hopsy> I can see in my browser the connection
[06:01:27] <Hopsy> I use
[06:01:33] <tehlulz> Looks sexy
[06:01:37] <tehlulz> too bad I'm a chrome boy ;P
[06:01:39] <Hopsy> all the request
[06:01:46] <Hopsy> no worry

[06:02:17] <tehlulz> I'll be sure to test it :)
[06:07:03] <Turbohao> i'm trying to get the next element with class .heading
[06:07:04] <Turbohao> http://jsfiddle.net/VPG7v/
[06:07:20] <Turbohao> i've got no clue what goes wrong
[06:08:12] <dabear> Turbohao: .next() will only search the immediately following sibling
[06:08:42] <dabear> Turbohao: so it will only search the h1 and see if it has a .heading
[06:08:49] <dabear> which it does not
[06:09:10] <Turbohao> i see
[06:09:37] <Turbohao> how can i find the next element?
[06:09:45] <Turbohao> with closest?
[06:10:28] <dabear> Turbohao: closest searches upwards, next searches one sibling, nextAll searches all the next siblings
[06:10:35] <Turbohao> aah
[06:10:36] <Turbohao> thanks
[06:10:38] <dabear> so .nextAll(".heading").first()
[06:11:23] <Turbohao> thanks works great
[06:12:48] <_ramo> hi
[06:13:11] <dabear> hola
[06:13:21] <_ramo> i would like to differentiate my site in two areas: the first are shown with links, and the second  should display the content of this links, if i click on them
[06:13:26] <_ramo> what do i need for that?
[06:13:49] <Hopsy> tehlulz: yeah google chrome supports web observer http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/dev/webRequest.html
[06:14:15] <Hopsy> so I could make also an chrome application for that
[06:14:32] <tehlulz> mint :)
[06:14:47] <tehlulz> you have a github?
[06:16:37] <greg6061> hi what's the best backend for backbone/jquery/rest app?
[06:16:55] <_ramo> i think i need click events for all links, and something like a loadIntoDiv function, right?
[06:21:20] <Wiggin> are these new questions or are they being handled
[06:21:37] <greg6061> Wiggin: new
[06:22:05] <Hopsy> tehlulz: yes somewhere :p
[06:22:24] <Hopsy> I dont use it very much
[06:22:42] <Wiggin> Interesting
[06:22:47] <Wiggin> Never used backbone before
[06:23:22] <Wiggin> I'm guessing it's whatever you're most familiar with?
[06:23:44] <tehlulz> You should. Git is great :P
[06:23:51] <Wiggin> Your backend shouldn't change by much when using backbone as compared to when you're not
[06:23:54] <tehlulz> I'd follow you to keep it up
[06:23:55] <tehlulz> pfft
[06:23:57] <tehlulz> dont use backbone
[06:23:59] <tehlulz> its filthy

[06:54:46] <tehlulz> its 200mb
[06:54:54] <Wiggin> one hour
[06:54:55] <tehlulz> thats what introduced me to it
[06:55:00] <Wiggin> o.o okay
[06:55:05] <tehlulz> (angular)
[06:55:23] <tehlulz> watch it when you have some free time :)
[06:55:23] <tehlulz> totally worth it
[06:55:23] <tehlulz> explains how Angular uses a MVC framework
[06:55:28] <tehlulz> for client
[06:55:28] <tehlulz> to handle responses
[06:55:28] <tehlulz> :)
[06:55:29] <tehlulz> very sexy
[06:55:32] <Wiggin> MongoDB o.o
[06:55:48] <Wiggin> NoSQL o.o
[06:55:57] <tehlulz> for storage
[06:56:06] <tehlulz> you can use mysql
[06:56:07] <tehlulz> :)
[06:56:08] <tehlulz> but
[06:56:15] <tehlulz> just skip through
[06:56:27] <tehlulz> till around
[06:56:52] <tehlulz> 55:08
[06:56:58] <tehlulz> thats when he starts explaining Angular
[06:58:21] <Hopsy> how do I scroll to the bottom of a div?
[06:58:35] <Hopsy> I am using this: $("#add").animate({scrollTop: $("#add").height()}, 800);
[06:58:41] <tehlulz> um
[06:58:57] <Hopsy> but it will scroll to the height of the div
[07:01:04] <tehlulz> Try $("#add").animate({ scrollTop: $("#add").attr("scrollHeight") }, 800);
[07:02:18] <Hopsy> that one doesnt scroll at all :s
[07:02:29] <Hopsy> #add is a div
[07:04:12] <Wiggin> I feel old already
[07:05:25] <[jasper]> hej guys, I have a question...if I hve the following code...http://pastebin.com/xd5zXx07  .... I have a function nested in another function.....will it know the z-index variable if I put var in front of it inside the other function?
[07:07:19] <Brunoz> hopsy $(document).ready ->
[07:07:20] <Brunoz>   $("#add").click ->
[07:07:20] <Brunoz>     $("html, body").animate
[07:07:20] <Brunoz>       scrollTop: 0
[07:07:20] <Brunoz>     , "slow"
[07:07:47] <Hopsy> Brunoz: scrolltop 0 ?
[07:07:53] <Hopsy> that will scroll to above
[07:08:35] <Brunoz> oh
[07:08:35] <Brunoz> xD
[07:08:37] <Brunoz> sry
[07:08:45] <Brunoz> 2min then
[07:08:52] <Brunoz> its the inverse
[07:08:54] <Brunoz> doh
[07:09:07] <Hopsy> this works: $("#add").animate({ scrollTop: '999999' }, 800);
[07:09:11] <Hopsy> but its not very handy
[07:09:18] <Hopsy> I need to know the height
[07:09:32] <tehlulz> Wiggin, how com?
[07:09:32] <tehlulz> Hopsy

[07:09:46] <[jasper]> can anybody help me with my problem or?
[07:10:01] <Brunoz> height of html?
[07:10:02] <Brunoz> :)

[07:10:10] <Wiggin> get off my lawn!
[07:10:23] <tehlulz> lol
[07:10:31] <tehlulz> How old are you? :P
[07:10:46] <Wiggin> ...seventeen
[07:10:52] <Hopsy> doesnt work tehlulz
[07:11:21] <tehlulz> [jasper]
[07:11:26] <Brunoz> why not
[07:11:32] <Brunoz> place an anchor on the bottom
[07:11:33] <Wiggin> I'll handle jasper's
[07:11:39] <Wiggin> jasper what's yo problem
[07:11:42] <Brunoz> and then scroll to it?
[07:11:45] <tehlulz> that doesnt work?
[07:11:47] <tehlulz> lol
[07:12:41] <Hopsy> tehlulz: only $("#add").height(); does work
[07:12:50] <Wiggin> [jasper]
[07:13:05] <Wiggin> mention my nick when you post your problem, yeah?
[07:13:33] <Wiggin> TIL Textmate can generate tables for you
[07:14:57] <[jasper]> Wiggin ?
[07:14:59] <[jasper]> hej guys, I have a question...if I hve the following code...http://pastebin.com/xd5zXx07  .... I have a function nested in another function.....will it know the z-index variable if I put var in front of it inside the other function?
[07:15:06] <Wiggin> mmhmm
[07:15:11] <[jasper]> since I figures it doesn't know the variable
[07:15:23] <[jasper]> so next question...how can I maek it know the variable..without making it global
[07:16:03] <tehlulz> pass it as an argument
[07:16:11] <Wiggin> yeah
[07:16:38] <[jasper]> how?
[07:16:40] <Wiggin> but lol global variables
[07:17:18] <Wiggin> hmm
[07:17:20] <Wiggin> interesting
[07:17:29] <[jasper]> what is?
[07:17:29] <Wiggin> you're sure it doesn't know z-index?
[07:17:42] <[jasper]> wiggin it's a different function is it not?
[07:17:44] <tehlulz> doSomething = function(){ ...
[07:17:44] <tehlulz> err
[07:17:55] <tehlulz> doSomething = function( z-index ) { ...
[07:17:59] <Hopsy> here you go tehlulz and Brunoz http://jsfiddle.net/PFwaB/
[07:18:19] <Wiggin> put alert(z-index) in the each(
[07:18:22] <Hopsy> it doesnt catch height
[07:18:23] <Wiggin> check
[07:18:33] <Wiggin> [jasper]: unless you have lots of divs
[07:18:42] <tehlulz> then
[07:18:42] <tehlulz> $( '#index_wrapper_popup' ).find( 'div' ).each( doSomething(z-index) );
[07:18:43] <tehlulz> something like that
[07:19:07] <stribor> i basically used this code http://jsfiddle.net/vG8rt/84/              which works fine in jffiddle but when i put it inside nody body it looks like image
[07:19:16] <tehlulz> Hopsy, checking it out :)
[07:19:37] <Hopsy> well good luck
[07:19:40] <Hopsy> :p
[07:19:46] <Wiggin> wait stribor where did you come from
[07:20:39] <```poo> stribor did you link to the .css
[07:21:04] <```poo> because yesterday you didnt do that in the fiddle itself
[07:21:14] <```poo> <-- shoky
[07:21:21] <Wiggin> oh and [jasper]
[07:21:43] <Wiggin> .css returns a string, so you need to *1 the retrieved z-index
[07:21:59] <Wiggin> css('z-index')*1 to convert it to an int
[07:22:10] <tehlulz> Hopsy
[07:22:11] <tehlulz> well
[07:22:22] <Hopsy> :p
[07:22:25] <tehlulz> the issue is to do with the overflow
[07:22:32] <Hopsy> ahh
[07:23:03] <tehlulz> so by using the height
[07:23:03] <tehlulz> if you use the height()
[07:23:06] <tehlulz> it will only scroll it 100px
[07:23:12] <Hopsy> indeed
[07:23:15] <tehlulz> because thats how high the div is
[07:23:19] <Hopsy> because the div is 100
[07:23:21] <stribor> i did link it to css and it works fine in jfiddle but when i paste this code inisde drupal node the text of the header kind of spills over like in the image i paste link above
[07:23:21] <tehlulz> sooo
[07:23:31] <tehlulz> *thinks*
[07:23:46] <Hopsy> an infinite number is dumb
[07:25:18] <BIG_Yack> Hello. How to have two actions in an if statement? I am trying to animate the :last element to raise width (from width:166px to width:332px) and apply a negative margin (from margin-left:0 to margin-left: -166px) at the same time ...
[07:25:28] <tehlulz> Hopsy
[07:25:28] <tehlulz> why not
[07:25:28] <tehlulz> inside that div
[07:25:37] <tehlulz> with auto overflow
[07:25:37] <tehlulz> have a P
[07:25:39] <tehlulz> and then set it from the height of the P
[07:25:57] <```poo> BIG_Yack: what do you mean.. what's the problem?
[07:26:05] <Hopsy> hmm so <div><p> ?
[07:26:19] <Hopsy> and div is auto overflow?
[07:26:28] <BIG_Yack> member:%60%60%60poo: I'm not faimilar with the syntax on how to have two action after an if ...
[07:26:37] <Wiggin> BIG_Yack: if(condition) { action1(); action2(); }
[07:26:47] <Wiggin> is that what you're looking for?
[07:26:57] <[jasper]> thx wiggin
[07:27:06] <[jasper]> btw...it did just know the zindex inside the other function....really
[07:27:07] <[jasper]> weird
[07:27:12] <Wiggin> all the statements in the braces get executed if you put that after an if statement
[07:27:19] <Wiggin> huh
[07:27:28] <Wiggin> the function you just created?
[07:27:33] <Wiggin> or an unrelated function
[07:27:45] <Wiggin> meh I don't get events and scoping
[07:27:48] <tehlulz> Hopsy
[07:27:50] <tehlulz> GOT IT
[07:27:52] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, pretty much. Can you take a look at http://pastebin.com/JyAhL0Wi
[07:27:57] <tehlulz> $("#add").animate({ scrollTop: $("#add").prop("scrollHeight") - $("#add").height() }, 800);
[07:28:08] <BIG_Yack> It seems not to be working - I'm not sure if I'm leaving something out ...
[07:28:11] <stribor> anyone here familiar with drupal at all?
[07:28:23] <Wiggin> BIG_Yack: I'll take a look
[07:28:30] <Wiggin> what doesn't work?
[07:28:32] <Hopsy> prop?!
[07:28:37] <tehlulz> properties
[07:28:37] <Hopsy> nicee
[07:28:52] <BIG_Yack> stribor, only with Drupal administration, not as much with templating for it.
[07:29:02] <Hopsy> first time I am hearing of that function
[07:29:03] <Hopsy> ?prop
[07:29:03] <caniuse> Hopsy: .prop(): Set one or more properties for the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[07:29:04] <bot-t1> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[07:29:05] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin: the script does not execute.
[07:29:08] <tehlulz> http://jsfiddle.net/PFwaB/
[07:29:23] <Wiggin> BIG_Yack: but no errors?
[07:29:28] <Hopsy> tehlulz: you must save first
[07:29:40] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, error on line 34
[07:29:40] <tehlulz> give that a roll
[07:29:59] <stribor> BIG_Yack: this reason i am asking is ecause when i paste this code which works perfect in jfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vG8rt/84/ i get result in drupal such as http://i44.tinypic.com/xcloxu.png
[07:30:10] <Hopsy> http://jsfiddle.net/PFwaB/3/
[07:30:21] <stribor> BIG_Yack: you see how text kind of spills over the arror in the image
[07:30:50] <tehlulz> :D
[07:30:52] <BIG_Yack> stribor, if you are pasting the code to a node input field directy, check your Filtering settings. Drupal may be filtering your code.
[07:31:01] <```poo> BIG_Yack:  $('div.menu ul li a').last.hover
[07:31:15] <```poo> did you mean .last() ?
[07:31:18] <stribor> BIG_Yack: its set to html already
[07:32:17] <BIG_Yack> stribor, try using the "All HTML" filter or create one. Then, don7t sue a WYSIWYG editor. If you have done this already, my knowledge is too little to tell what is going wrong at current.
[07:32:47] <BIG_Yack> member:%60%60%60poo, is it .last()? I cannot acess api.jquery.com from here so what I wrote was from my head :-)
[07:32:54] <```poo> yes, it is
[07:32:58] <Wiggin> BIG_Yack I think your animate syntax is wrong
[07:33:08] <Wiggin> duration, easing and complete aren't in a map
[07:33:11] <```poo> they can be
[07:33:15] <FernandoBasso> I can't get it to understand what linke in the 'nav' I have clicked and apply the css class. http://jsfiddle.net/6skKe/
[07:33:17] <Wiggin> oh they can?
[07:33:17] <Wiggin> derp
[07:33:20] <```poo> aye
[07:33:25] <```poo> per teh docs
[07:33:26] <stribor> BIG_Yack: i can easily solve this (which i did ) by inserting &nbsp; to enforce more white space....but this is solving it only for particular size of screen....,if you try to see the page on different size of screen it doesnt work as desried
[07:33:29] <Wiggin> ah okay
[07:33:55] <BIG_Yack> stribor, is the page online to see it here?
[07:34:12] <stribor> http://i44.tinypic.com/xcloxu.png
[07:34:48] <Wiggin> yes BIG_Yack it should be .last().hover(
[07:35:06] <Wiggin> api.jquery.com just went online again, I think
[07:35:06] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, OK, will try.
[07:35:16] <stribor> you see in the image if i put couple &nbsp before first "Section 1" and couple of them between  9 and 10 "Section 1" that will solve this
[07:35:17] <Wiggin> ?down api.jquery.com
[07:35:20] <bot-t1> Wiggin, It's just you. - http://api.jquery.com is up.
[07:35:24] <BIG_Yack> Yes, it's on.
[07:35:30] <```poo> hasnt been down here for a while
[07:35:36] <Wiggin> It was down for me just now
[07:36:11] <BIG_Yack> For me as well, for a couple of hours.
[07:36:20] <BIG_Yack> stribor, this is weird!
[07:36:29] <stribor> BIG_Yack: why?
[07:38:03] <Wiggin> uh
[07:38:12] <Wiggin> FernandoBasso
[07:38:36] <Wiggin> what's your problem?
[07:38:37] <BIG_Yack> member:%60%60%60poo and Wiggin, I changed it to last() and it still does not animate.
[07:38:58] <```poo> BIG_Yack: then jsfiddle it
[07:39:03] <```poo> and we can help more
[07:39:06] <BIG_Yack> OK
[07:39:33] <stribor> BIG_Yack: why is it weird
[07:39:35] <FernandoBasso> Wiggin: I can't add a class. That class should change the color of the link which corresponds to the current loaded page.
[07:41:44] <BIG_Yack> member:%60%60%60poo, here it is: member:%60%60%60poo
[07:41:53] <BIG_Yack> http://jsfiddle.net/rdqM5/
[07:42:45] <BIG_Yack> stribor, it seems like Drupal's core is enforcing padding or margin changes.
[07:43:11] <FernandoBasso> Wiggin: I mean, the code is supposed to add a class, but when I look at the code with firebug, the class is not there. I am out of ideas concerning what is wrong in that code.
[07:44:14] <stribor> BIG_Yack: is there anything i c an do?
[07:44:42] <BIG_Yack> stribor, what theme are you using for your site?
[07:44:53] * tehlulz is sleepy
[07:45:00] <stribor> i would prefer not to edit and templates for the theme
[07:45:45] <BIG_Yack> stirobr, it usually is the way to go. In Drupal, you have dynamic templates - you can edit the template only for one node type or so.
[07:46:04] <BIG_Yack> So, if you have an article and want to add tabs to all the article nodoes, just edit the templatename-article.tpl.php
[07:46:23] <stribor> BIG_Yack: yes but i need this functionality for only one single node of the page type
[07:47:11] <Wiggin> FernandoBasso: does the page loading thing work?
[07:47:25] <FernandoBasso> Wiggin: Yes it does.
[07:47:28] <Wiggin> It doesn't seem like it works in jsfiddle
[07:47:58] <Munger> When I add an item within a div in the html, it gets positioned correctly and sets the scrollbar on the parent div accordingly. When I try to add the item dynamically in jquery, It gets seems to ignore the absolute position and place it at 0,0 within the div. Any ideas why?
[07:48:39] <FernandoBasso> Wiggin: http://localhost:8080/BadSites/
[07:48:47] <Wiggin> ?
[07:48:49] <Wiggin> localhost?
[07:48:49] <FernandoBasso> Sorry, not that.
[07:49:01] <Shapeshifter> Hi. Why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/fkkrW/ Clicking on the text field has no effect. Same if I use focus( instead of click(. I want the text in the text field to be selected when the user clicks on it.
[07:49:08] <Wiggin> got me worried for a second that you ftped into my computer and put it in localhost heh
[07:49:29] <FernandoBasso> http://gotek.no-ip.org:8080/BadSites/
[07:49:31] <```poo> BIG_Yack:
[07:49:38] <```poo> margin-left should be in quotes
[07:49:47] <BIG_Yack> Why is that?
[07:50:24] <BIG_Yack> Nevermind, stupid question ;-)
[07:50:52] <```poo> it's not stupid :)
[07:52:53] <Wiggin> FernandoBasso: umm it may be something wrong with your selector
[07:53:20] <```poo> i think you can also use marginLeft
[07:53:27] <Wiggin> try 'nav a[href="'+newHash+'"]' instead
[07:53:42] <FernandoBasso> Let me see. Thanks for now.
[07:53:47] <Munger> Is there a known problem with creating elements with position: absolute ?
[07:54:03] <BIG_Yack> member:%60%60%60poo, now the width change works but there still is no margin applied.
[07:54:30] <```poo> BIG_Yack: enjoy debugging that ;)
[07:54:42] <```poo> if after a while you're stuck again,.......
[07:55:04] <BIG_Yack> ... I will kindly ask here. thanks for the help :-)
[07:55:11] <```poo> np
[07:56:03] <Wiggin> Munger: I don't…think so
[07:56:22] <FernandoBasso> Wiggin: I will send you a gitf. It worked. Thanks a -lot-.
[07:56:41] <Wiggin> Munger: try applying the attributes after adding the item in jquery
[07:56:56] <Wiggin> haha you're welcome FernandoBasso
[07:57:00] <Wiggin> glad to help
[07:57:04] <```poo> Wiggin i hope you share it
[07:57:08] <Wiggin> it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside

[07:57:25] <```poo> please :(
[07:57:35] <Wiggin> the cake is a lie

[07:58:35] <Wiggin> Munger: how's it going
[07:58:47] <Wiggin> spoiler alert: rue dies
[07:58:49] <Munger> Wiggin, Can I give you a URL?
[07:58:53] <Wiggin> sure
[07:59:02] <rue> It's truAAAAAAAAaaaaargh
[07:59:27] <```poo> Shapeshifter: not sure what you're expecting to happen there
[07:59:49] <```poo> or what you think .select() does
[07:59:50] <Wiggin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJfowXTXOfU
[08:00:34] <FernandoBasso> Wiggin: I'm glad you helped.
[08:00:38] <Wiggin> starts at 0:44 if you're lazy
[08:00:40] <Wiggin> heh
[08:00:43] <Wiggin> I'm glad I helped
[08:09:02] <Shapeshifter> ```poo: I'd just want all the text in the field to be selected when the text field is clicked on.
[08:09:36] <```poo> ok that is not what .select() is for
[08:09:46] <```poo> don't just randomly use functions
[08:09:52] <Shapeshifter> ```poo: I see that now.
[08:10:54] <```poo> hmm
[08:11:06] <ninjaprecision> Anyone here using a macbook pro with firefox/firebug?
[08:11:18] <```poo> Shapeshifter: sorry
[08:11:27] <```poo> jqueryObj.select()  is not what you want
[08:11:33] <```poo> but DOMElement.select() IS what you want
[08:12:56] <```poo> Shapeshifter: you were missing closing parens
[08:12:57] <Shapeshifter> ```poo: that must have been what had confused me. Thanks
[08:12:59] <```poo> see http://jsfiddle.net/fkkrW/1/
[08:13:39] <```poo> well so jqueryObj.select() it is
[08:19:15] <BIG_Yack> member:%60%60%60pooo: can you see http://jsfiddle.net/rdqM5/3/ again, please? I got it working with no aparent errors but it does not animate. Did I miss some brackets again?
[08:20:30] <Wiggin> I just realised
[08:20:36] <Wiggin> BIG_Yack is not BIG_Yak
[08:20:54] <Wiggin> I need sleep
[08:21:52] <jrockjiggz> any ideas why selectors.find(':checked') won't work?
[08:22:28] <alexr2> jrockjiggz, show some code of how you're using it. jsfiddle.net
[08:27:32] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, don'worry about the nickname - it's a spelling mistake from the "old days of IRC" that remained my nickanem :-)
[08:27:48] <BIG_Yack> Did you had the time to look at http://jsfiddle.net/rdqM5/3/?
[08:28:06] <BIG_Yack> Does JSFiddle have a debugger?
[08:28:12] <Wiggin> haha old days of IRC
[08:28:32] <Wiggin> I'm too young to be alive then ;)
[08:28:39] <```poo> BIG_Yack: you have an extra dot: $(this).animate.({width: "166px"}, {duration: 450,
[08:28:41] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, not really.
[08:28:55] <Wiggin> or am I mixing it up with BBSes
[08:29:11] <BIG_Yack> The old days of IRC for me are 2000 or so when I started using it.
[08:29:14] <Wiggin> the 90s?
[08:29:17] <Wiggin> oh really?
[08:29:27] <BIG_Yack> Or it maybe was 1999, because I had Win95 installed.
[08:29:34] <Wiggin> I thought they already moved on to bigger and better things by then
[08:29:46] <```poo> BBSs ftw
[08:29:54] <Wiggin> All I knew of IRC was what the schools warned us
[08:29:55] <BIG_Yack> Nope. At least in my area. There were better things, but not bigger.
[08:30:06] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, what did the schools warn you about?
[08:30:06] <```poo> BIG_Yack did that fix it
[08:30:08] <Wiggin> that it was frequented by child predators and kidnappers and not much else
[08:30:10] <Wiggin> heeeh
[08:30:17] <Wiggin> then I discovered the wonders of freenode
[08:30:31] <Wiggin> and it's kinda dumb that they would still be here if all the kids left
[08:30:35] <hobs> filled with child predators and kidnappers
[08:30:42] <hobs> well its comfortable by then
[08:30:48] <```poo> big_yack you can debug i think in JSFiddle if you choose JQuery edge and check firebug
[08:30:57] <```poo> or just.. with firebug/etc
[08:31:12] <hobs> its like the child pred/kidnapper hang out joint for after hours discussion
[08:31:19] <BIG_Yack> member:```pooo: where is the extra dot?
[08:31:35] <```poo> on the line where the console says there is an error
[08:31:45] <```poo> the one i pasted to you...
[08:32:51] <Wiggin> hobs: I picked up three kids today with free candy, you?
[08:32:52] <BIG_Yack> The funny thing is Dreamweaver is not detecting an error :-) I must get ahold of that Firebug thing you are talking about :-)
[08:33:01] <```poo> what browser are you using
[08:33:05] <```poo> ew dreamweaver
[08:33:09] <Wiggin> It's a firefox plugin
[08:33:10] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, that was you? Good candy.
[08:33:26] <Wiggin> spoiler alert it wasn't candy
[08:33:30] <BIG_Yack> '''poo: Safari / Chromium / Opera
[08:33:43] <```poo> big_yack then you should have a builtin debugger
[08:33:44] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, pssst.
[08:33:45] <wroathe> Is there an accepted best practice for adding extra input fields with jQuery? The company I work for right now has "template html" that they put inside of the form and set to display: none; Then they have a few functions set up to grab that html and copy it.
[08:33:57] <```poo> donno about opera
[08:34:14] <BIG_Yack> '''poo, the one in "Inspect element"?
[08:34:23] <```poo> the developer tools, yes
[08:34:26] <```poo> ctrl-shift-i in chrome
[08:34:30] <Wiggin> wroathe: you mean besides append("<input type='stuff'></input>") ?
[08:34:31] <```poo> scripts tab
[08:34:58] <BIG_Yack> Something new every day.
[08:35:03] <jrockjiggz> would anyone know why $('el:checked') works but not $('el').find(':checked') ?? example http://jsfiddle.net/C8ELN/
[08:35:13] <BIG_Yack> Then again, I can't say that I had "the old days of scripting" as I said for IRC :-)
[08:35:20] <wroathe> Wiggin: They do something like that but they have already existing html that they do something like $('form').append($('template-html').html())
[08:35:45] <alexr2> jrockjiggz, .find goes into the children of el
[08:35:56] <alexr2> el:checked looks at el and sees if it's checked
[08:36:48] <jrockjiggz> okk. maybe filter() then
[08:37:20] <Wiggin> wroathe: is there anything wrong with that now? o.o
[08:37:27] <Wiggin> don't fix what ain't broken
[08:37:28] <Wiggin> heh
[08:37:43] <granden> The mobile channel is pretty dead, so I try in here. Please dont kill me :)
[08:38:09] <jrockjiggz> yes, filter seems to do the trick
[08:38:09] <Wiggin> heh
[08:38:10] <granden> Why is the latest version of jquery mobile giving really small text, and wide webpages
[08:38:13] <wroathe> Wiggin: It's just ugly... I'm trying to think of a better way.
[08:38:24] <jrockjiggz> alexr2: ty
[08:38:27] <granden> compare these, http://agfoto.se/m/index.html
[08:38:28] <granden> and
[08:38:30] <alexr2> no problem
[08:38:36] <granden> http://agfoto.se/m/index2.html
[08:38:48] <granden> jquery and jquery mobile version is specified in the title.
[08:38:53] <Wiggin> wroathe: sure, just try not to bork it ;) better an ugly way of making it work than an elegant and nonfunctional solution
[08:39:02] <granden> On a computer they look the same, but on an iphone/desire not so much.
[08:39:41] <wroathe> Wiggin: True :)
[08:39:54] <wroathe> I'm branching off of an existing branch that I called 'crazy idea branch'
[08:39:55] <Wiggin> and wroathe if it's all identical html just make sure styles aren't being defined inline
[08:40:03] <Wiggin> and perhaps move it to a string in javascript
[08:40:10] <wroathe> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2217409/jquery-best-practice-for-creating-complex-html-fragments
[08:40:15] <wroathe> I think this solves my problem.
[08:41:42] <Wiggin> wroathe: how many input elements do you have?
[08:42:09] <ParanoidGal> Wiggin are you still here?!
[08:42:14] <Wiggin> haha yup
[08:42:19] <Wiggin> You're still here?
[08:42:32] <ParanoidGal> Indeed I can't stay away from you ;)
[08:43:36] <Wiggin> wrothe if the elements can be generated with loops then sure go for it but if not…it's probably not worth the trouble
[08:43:39] <Wiggin> just saying :)
[08:44:32] <Wiggin> ParanoidGal: is it bad form for me to follow you on twitter
[08:44:35] <Wiggin> because I just did
[08:48:33] <ParanoidGal> Lol no not at all
[08:48:44] <ParanoidGal> I will follow you back when I find you ;)
[08:49:16] <ParanoidGal> Wiggin how hard would it be to do a simple recreation of the plugin I was being driven mad by
[08:49:16] <wroathe> Wiggin: It's simply a button that appends a new fieldset with ~4 fields on click
[08:49:28] <ParanoidGal> Taking into account I've never designed one like it..
[08:49:30] <Wiggin> remind me which plugin it was, again?
[08:49:49] <Wiggin> wroathe: well then it doesn't really matter either way
[08:50:00] <ParanoidGal> http://codecanyon.net/item/jquery-carousel-evolution-for-wordpress/702228?WT.ac=category_item&WT.seg_1=category_item&WT.z_author=yougapi
[08:50:06] <Wiggin> if it's a crazy-huge chunk of different input elements then there's not much point
[08:50:21] <Wiggin> ah
[08:50:22] <Wiggin> why?
[08:50:25] <Wiggin> what's wrong with it
[08:50:31] <Wiggin> also paid plugins o.o
[08:51:24] <ParanoidGal> I know! Wasn't my choice, they wanted it! They still have errors so I just want to get rid of it and start over but to be honest have no idea where to start!
[08:51:49] <Wiggin> hmm
[08:51:59] <Wiggin> it shouldn't be too hard
[08:52:15] <Wiggin> you want the number of items to be variable, right?
[08:52:39] <Wiggin> besides
[08:52:43] <ParanoidGal> Preferably, but if it makes easier then could easily convince the client to stop at 5
[08:52:49] <Wiggin> you sure you want to reinvent the wheel? http://www.pixelzdesign.com/blog_view.php?id=55
[08:54:03] <ParanoidGal> Well preferably not if I can just find a similar alternative!
[08:55:51] <Wiggin> Hmm
[08:56:00] <Wiggin> what kind of errors are they getting, anyway?
[08:56:17] <Wiggin> seems like a lot of work to redesign around another plugin :P
[08:56:52] <ParanoidGal> Just what weird fading thing but the purpose of the site is to take it to meetings on her laptop to pitch so kind of crucial it works
[08:57:12] <Wiggin> http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout#/demos
[08:57:47] <Wiggin> this seems simple enough
[08:59:08] <ParanoidGal> Yeah looks good! Just need to implement a couple of arrows and should be good to go :)
[09:01:34] <Wiggin> mmh
[09:04:33] <Advocated> i'm looking for a stylish looking login form/dialog/ or similar, i've been looking for ages yet can't see anything that takes my eye, any recommendations out there at all?
[09:04:59] <Wiggin> alright it's getting late and I have school in the morning
[09:05:05] <Wiggin> seeya
[09:05:06] <Wiggin> ooh
[09:05:09] <Wiggin> new problem
[09:05:11] <Wiggin> duty calls
[09:05:32] <Wiggin> Advocated: you want to take a look at http://speckyboy.com/2009/08/26/20-jquery-plugins-and-tutorials-to-enhance-forms/ and see if anything catches your eye?
[09:05:57] <Wiggin> wait not that link
[09:07:59] <Wiggin> aha
[09:08:01] <Wiggin> http://www.queness.com/post/204/25-jquery-plugins-that-enhance-and-beautify-html-form-elements
[09:08:16] <Wiggin> Advocated just mix and match, mostly
[09:10:16] <Munger> My plugin implements several custom views which are interdependant. Can I roll these into a single plugin, or am I better off implementing each view as a separate plugin?
[09:10:26] <Wiggin> custom views?
[09:10:37] <Wiggin> like..themes?
[09:11:41] <BIG_Yack> This is driving me nuts. On http://jsfiddle.net/rdqM5/6/ I got the hover correct, now on hoovering out, the margin doesn't want to reset itself.
[09:11:59] <Munger> Wiggin, Ala albumBrowser I showed you just now. The top-level div is the albumBrowser, nested within tthat there are albumPages, within that that there are albumViews. Each of these has it's own functionality
[09:12:15] <Wiggin> ah
[09:12:23] <Wiggin> wait so you're making your own plugin?
[09:12:54] <Wiggin> BIG_Yack: for the Valuta tab, right?
[09:13:07] <Munger> Yes, but for my own purposes. I want to re-use it in several places, so a plugin makes sense
[09:13:28] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, right.
[09:13:50] <Wiggin> I suppose
[09:14:06] <BIG_Yack> It's more fun when it's in foreign languages, heh
[09:14:13] <Wiggin> well if you're not planning to use them separately, and they depend on each other, then by all means do it in a single plugin
[09:15:07] <Munger> Wiggin. Do you know of an example that shows how to roll something like this into one?
[09:17:16] <Wiggin> ?
[09:17:25] <Wiggin> say I haven't looked at the rest of your code
[09:17:27] <Zeph88> I could use some help I am trying to add a class to every other row of a specific table. I got this to work:  $('tr:even').addClass('stripeEven');  but it applies to every table. How can I filter down to just one table?
[09:17:36] <Wiggin> and I'm not sure which parts are dependent on each other
[09:17:55] <Wiggin> Zeph88: select the table before the tr selector
[09:17:58] <BIG_Yack> Zeph88, us a class for a table.
[09:18:05] <Wiggin> $(".tableclass tr:even")
[09:18:15] <Wiggin> or $("#tableid tr:even")
[09:18:24] <Zeph88> Can I use an ID instead?
[09:18:27] <Zeph88> Ah okay - Thank you
[09:20:52] <Wiggin> BIG_Yack: hrrm your approach is interesting
[09:21:08] <Wiggin> but when you hover over any of them it changes the width of the page
[09:21:18] <Wiggin> or does it
[09:22:49] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, it does not / it should not..
[09:23:28] <BIG_Yack> This is not the end result. There will be 332 x 130 icons instead of the background colors.
[09:23:56] <Wiggin> okay I see the problem
[09:24:05] <Wiggin> I think it's with your stopping of animations
[09:24:21] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, me too. I tried to fiddle with moving, changin the .stop().
[09:24:30] <coachz> hi
[09:24:43] <BIG_Yack> But after all of this I don't understand anymore why i putted that in :-)
[09:24:59] <Wiggin> hi coachz
[09:25:09] <Wiggin> you..shouldn't need to stop
[09:25:13] <coachz> is there a jquery plugin to replace table layout of text with something more attractive ?  I want it to hold this text in these tables:  http://www.atouchofclassband.com/index.php
[09:25:19] <Wiggin> actually no
[09:25:22] <Wiggin> don't stop all animated
[09:26:26] <Zeph88> So my old function was based on children of divs, and I was able to do $(this).children('#id:even') . . . can you not do that with a table only with $(this).children('tr:even')
[09:26:26] <Zeph88> So my old function was based on children of divs, and I was able to do $(this).children('#id:even') . . . can you not do that with a table only with $(this).children('tr:even')
[09:26:26] <Zeph88> Is there something obviously wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/Pzz8SQAX
[09:26:31] <Zeph88> woah sorry
[09:27:27] <BIG_Yack> Zeph88, if you have (#tableid tr), the children would be (#tableid tr tr).
[09:27:34] <BIG_Yack> So, do only (this).even()
[09:27:45] <ajpiano> Zeph88: do find instead of children
[09:27:52] <ajpiano> trs aren't direct children of the tables that contain them
[09:28:02] <Wiggin> actually BIG_Yack why not just use position:relative
[09:28:14] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, with what element?
[09:28:16] <Wiggin> margin_left has all the box model headaches
[09:28:22] <Wiggin> all the ul li a
[09:28:36] <Wiggin> wtf
[09:28:41] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, how does that solve it?
[09:28:44] <BIG_Yack> Will try.
[09:28:51] <Wiggin> only in this channel and #html does "ul li a" mean anything to anybody
[09:29:05] <Wiggin> It might be a box model thing
[09:29:16] <Zeph88> Awesome, thanks! I did not know that tr.'s were not children...
[09:30:00] <Wiggin> okay I really need to get to sleep ><
[09:30:11] <Wiggin> sorry BIG_Yack if I didn't manage to solve your problem
[09:30:25] <Wiggin> have school in the morning
[09:30:27] <Wiggin> night
[09:30:32] <BIG_Yack> Wiggin, no problem.
[09:30:34] <BIG_Yack> Night.
[09:30:41] <BIG_Yack> Maybe we can do it tomorrow.
[09:33:25] <coachz> is there a jquery plugin to replace table layout of text with something more attractive ?  I want it to hold this text in these tables:  http://www.atouchofclassband.com/index.php
[09:33:38] <coachz> What's a nice way to display text ?
[09:38:55] <Zeph88> Stupid question are TDs a child of a TR?
[09:39:12] <coachz> yep
[09:39:19] <Zeph88> k - thanks
[09:39:41] <coachz> because they are nested in the <tr><td></td></tr>
[09:40:36] <ParanoidGal> How can I change this from showing 3 images to 5? http://eliasentertainment.net/testcarousel.html
[09:41:12] <coachz> it's showing 6 currently
[09:41:33] <ParanoidGal> I mean 5 upfront sorry
[09:42:05] <coachz> ahh
[09:42:21] <ParanoidGal> I always miss out the vital facts!
[09:44:46] <coachz> is it here?  http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout#/demos
[09:44:55] <coachz> one of those options 1/3 way down ?
[09:45:48] <coachz> hmm i don't see an option to adjust the number visible
[09:46:24] <ParanoidGal> coachz neither do I but can't be impossible just thought I might be missing something obvious!!
[09:47:38] <Goopyo> $(item).sibling(".news_vote.neutral span").text(msg) is that right? I want to grab the sibling of item, that is <div class="news_vote neutral"><span></span></div> and change the span within it to msg
[09:51:53] <Munger> Is 500 empty divs DOM abuse?
[09:52:23] <Munger> I think it is,but it would make the code easier :-)
[09:54:16] <markq> all divs above the first 10 should be generated live divs or you're doing something wrong
[09:54:48] <Munger> They are generated in code
[09:56:14] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[09:58:09] <Munger> markq, They are just placeholders for ajax data. Only three will ever have any content, the others will be emptied when not visible. I could remove the divs entirely, but I can't see them using too much memory when empty
[10:11:14] <Teduardo> does anyone know of a decent password strength'o'meter for jquery which is considered the 'best way' of doing it?
[10:15:54] <janthony> Any idea why $("body").wrapInner('<div id="mcd-body-wrap-temp" />'); wouldn't work on certain sites? I checked the site it isn't working on and it's using jquery 1.7.1 and looks like wrapInner was implemented in 1.2 and 1.4
[10:19:25] <michael_mbp> hi
[10:20:03] <michael_mbp> if I have a dom element and chain .live calls, does that mean each chained .live call will only be delegated on the previous?
[10:20:29] <jrockjiggz> michael_mbp: see end()
[10:20:33] <jrockjiggz> ?end @ michael_mbp
[10:20:33] <caniuse> michael_mbp: .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[10:20:34] <bot-t1> michael_mbp, .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[10:20:40] <michael_mbp> i.e. el.live(func1{}).live(funct2{}) is this ok
[10:21:04] <michael_mbp> ah, so it have to state multiple el.live calls
[10:21:07] <michael_mbp> ok.
[10:21:26] <jrockjiggz> well its for getting back to your previous selection..
[10:21:41] <michael_mbp> essentially this https://gist.github.com/4b3ec2a393a860717d49
[10:21:50] <michael_mbp> I guess it's going to get rather long winded.
[10:22:26] <michael_mbp> was wondering it if could be written any more compact
[10:23:22] <janthony> Anyone?
[10:25:20] <michael_mbp> couldn't I do this jrockjiggz https://gist.github.com/4b3ec2a393a860717d49
[10:26:38] <janthony> $("body").wrapInner('<div id="mcd-body-wrap-temp"></div>'); isn't working either. I have a return false; right after this line, and it's loading a new page instead.
[10:27:15] <jrockjiggz> interesting approach. i can only suggest using something like http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2007/06/05/bind-multiple-events-simultaneously-with-jquery/
[10:28:10] <michael_mbp> thanks jrockjiggz
[10:29:02] <jrockjiggz> janthony: you can replicate your problem on www.jsfiddle.net and see someone might know the problem
[10:30:33] <jrockjiggz> michael_mbp: is there a reason you are binding ajax events?
[10:30:56] <michael_mbp> doing CRUD in rails via ajax
[10:31:07] <jrockjiggz> ah..
[10:31:11] <michael_mbp> jrockjiggz: hmm I can't find his plugin
[10:31:19] <jrockjiggz> yea its a little old
[10:31:32] <michael_mbp> and one of the posts states it's in jquery core
[10:32:49] <ParanoidGal> Can anyone see how to get the second layer of images moved more into the center behind the first http://www.eliasentertainment.net/js/jquery.roundabout.js / http://www.eliasentertainment.net/testcarousel.html
[10:33:08] <Goopyo> $(item).sibling(".news_vote.neutral span").text(msg) is that right? I want to grab the sibling of item, that is <div class="news_vote neutral"><span></span></div> and change the span within it to msg
[10:33:48] <jrockjiggz> $(item + '~.news_vote.neutral span').text(msg)
[10:34:34] <ajpiano> ...
[10:34:48] <ajpiano> Goopyo: there is no "sibling" method, it's "siblings"
[10:34:52] <ajpiano> jrockjiggz: see ?concatobj
[10:34:53] <bot-t1> jrockjiggz, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).
[10:35:30] <Goopyo> ajpiano:  $(item).siblings(".news_vote.neutral").children(".span").value(msg);
[10:35:33] <Goopyo> doesnt work either
[10:35:42] <ajpiano> there also is no "value" method, it's see ?val
[10:35:43] <bot-t1> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[10:35:48] <ajpiano> Goopyo: are you debugging your code
[10:35:51] <jrockjiggz> .val(msg)
[10:35:57] <Goopyo> no is there a good one i can use?
[10:36:05] <ajpiano> are you using the console to see what errors are coming up, because both .sibling and .value would have thrown errors to the console
[10:36:10] <ajpiano> ?ftj @ Goopyo
[10:36:11] <bot-t1> Goopyo, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:36:16] <Goopyo> thanks
[10:37:36] <jrockjiggz> ajpiano: is $('el',this) equivalent as $('el').extend(this) ?
[10:37:42] <ajpiano> ....no
[10:37:45] <jrockjiggz> o
[10:37:47] <ajpiano> it's the same as $(this).find("el")
[10:38:22] <jrockjiggz> right
[10:38:24] <Goopyo> no errors on this one in the console: $(item).siblings(".news_vote.neutral").children(".span").val(msg);
[10:39:05] <ajpiano> there are other things that can go wrong *besides* deliberate errors
[10:39:20] <jrockjiggz> Goopyo: you can see what your selection is using console.log( $(item).siblings(".news_vote.neutral").children(".span").val(msg) )
[10:39:25] <ajpiano> but the fact that you weren't using undefined methods and not seeing errors led me to think you weren't debugging at all
[10:40:03] <Goopyo> oh nice
[10:40:04] <Goopyo> []
[10:40:10] <Goopyo> ill look into that
[10:40:37] <Aquaguy> Hello
[10:41:12] <Aquaguy> By any chance is possible to download a .zip by using $.post ?
[10:41:29] <Aquaguy> in the callback function I get the zip raw data
[10:41:38] <Aquaguy> but dont know if I can make it to download
[10:41:42] <ajpiano> Goopyo: children(".span") ?
[10:41:58] <ajpiano> are you trying to select span elements or (i hope not) elements with the class "span"
[10:42:15] <ajpiano> Aquaguy: pretty much nope
[10:42:43] <Goopyo> this is embarrassing (first couple days with jquery, I swear), but I wanted span elements
[10:42:45] <ajpiano> you can only trigger a download by serving back the file with the proper content-disposition headers and redirecting to the page with a window.open or window.location
[10:42:54] <ajpiano> Goopyo: then do .children("span")
[10:43:01] <ajpiano> Goopyo: learning to debug will save you the embarassment
[10:43:04] <Goopyo> so . is for class?
[10:43:08] <ajpiano> you just have to learn to diagnose when you are doing something wrong
[10:43:10] <ajpiano> Goopyo: yes, same as css
[10:43:25] <coachz> Is there a jQuery picture gallery plugin that's super easy and will add all images in a dir ?
[10:43:29] <Goopyo> I will def read that ppt you linked me to
[10:43:37] <ajpiano> please do
[10:44:07] <coachz> if i have a lot of pictures, adding them manually is unwieldy
[10:44:31] <ajpiano> coachz: there is no jquery plugin that can read files off the backend and magically put them into a carousel
[10:44:46] <ajpiano> coachz: the job of your backend is to read the directory and spit out the images, jquery will work on whatever you output
[10:44:49] <coachz> ok
[10:45:12] <coachz> do you know an easy gallery to implement where i put the files in?  I'm looking at this one.  http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic/index.html
[10:45:32] <ajpiano> nope
[10:45:46] <ajpiano> every single gallery will support displaying whatever files you output from your backend
[10:52:27] <coachz> ajpiano, do you know a simple gallery that generates the thumbnails so I don't have to make them ?
[10:53:10] <ajpiano> not off the top of my head
[10:53:16] <ajpiano> again, seems like a backend thing
[10:53:24] <coachz> i figured js could do it
[10:53:46] <umren> coachz that will be bad for your frontend
[10:53:51] <ajpiano> how is that "generating" a thumbnail
[10:53:59] <ajpiano> generating it means generating it once and using it
[10:54:12] <ajpiano> not dynamically doing something with javascript on every single page load for every single client
[10:54:22] <tw2113> but js can't do everything these days??
[10:55:03] <coachz> it could just resize them and use them as thumbnails
[10:55:09] <tw2113> go for that then
[10:55:18] <ajpiano> yes, it could, that's not considered "generating" a thumbnail
[10:55:24] <coachz> i'm looking for a simple gallery plugin
[10:55:25] <ajpiano> that's showing the image smaller than it is
[10:55:31] <coachz> right
[10:55:38] <ajpiano> coachz: http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/
[10:55:42] <ajpiano> do some research on your own
[10:55:55] <coachz> that's too overwhelming
[10:56:01] <tw2113> i guarantee there are many gallery plugins
[10:56:15] <coachz> i need a super simple one
[10:56:18] <tw2113> and more to come because people love reinventing the wheel
[10:56:23] <coachz> hahaha
[10:56:28] <ajpiano> you know what's overwhelming?
[10:56:35] <coachz> yeah i do
[10:56:37] <ajpiano> when someone asks other people to do their work
[10:57:02] <coachz> ajpiano, you being pissy today i see
[10:57:04] <Goopyo> ajpiano: can you check this out http://jsfiddle.net/2QNLd/
[10:57:31] <ajpiano> coachz: i don't understand how many months of help-vamping on your part we're supposed to deal with before you get at least a mild dressing-down
[10:57:32] <ajpiano> come on.
[10:57:56] <coachz> ajpiano, if you don't want to help, then don't, but don't be rude
[10:58:45] <ajpiano> i'm not being rude. i'm pointing out that this is literally your MO.
[10:58:52] <coachz> you are being rude
[10:59:17] <Goopyo> I want to make it so that, if any of the news_vote's are clicked the span within "news_vote neutral" to get updated with the msg from the ajax
[10:59:20] <coachz> i have not been rude to you so please don't talk down to me, i'm twice your age
[10:59:34] <ajpiano> coachz: what exactly makes you think i care how old you are.
[10:59:47] <coachz> ajpiano, it's basic respect you are missing
[11:00:09] <tw2113> don't most people say "respect is earned" ?
[11:00:11] <ajpiano> Goopyo: give me a few minutes, i'm finishing up something then i'll take a look
[11:00:19] <Goopyo> sure thing mate, thanks
[11:00:22] <```poo> ajpiano can be as rude as he wants. but he's not :D
[11:00:33] <coachz> he is rude to me, maybe not you
[11:00:49] <coachz> i'm done
[11:01:08] <```poo> he even gave you a link..
[11:01:16] <tw2113> he subscribes to the idea of people learning as they go along, not constantly needing handholding
[11:01:19] <coachz> a link to nowhere
[11:01:37] <coachz> i'm done thanks
[11:01:39] <```poo> and as he said, you don't generate thumbnails in js..
[11:01:49] <coachz> poo, thanks !
[11:01:50] <```poo> not in the browser at least
[11:02:18] <tw2113> image generation would be best on the server

[11:03:55] <Goopyo> in the spirit of this discussion: any good quick reading lessons on jquery? I'm a python dev that has to mess around with it every once in a while. Dont want a full out book, maybe a quick manual?
[11:04:08] <Goopyo> primairly ajax and dom manipulation
[11:04:18] <```poo> the jquery docs
[11:04:29] <```poo> they are as concise as needed
[11:04:30] <ajpiano> Goopyo: you need to use .children("span") not .children(".span")
[11:04:38] <ajpiano> ?jqf @ Goopyo
[11:04:38] <bot-t1> Goopyo, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[11:05:06] <```poo> ajpiano: any plans on a new yayquery anytime??
[11:05:22] <Goopyo> ajpiano: yeah got that already that .span was in the console log one I was playing around with
[11:05:36] <ajpiano> `poo: maybe )
[11:05:38] <ajpiano> ;)
[11:05:41] <```poo> ;)
[11:05:41] <Goopyo> btw if neutral is clicked will it register as its own sibling?
[11:05:57] <Goopyo> or do I have to do something about that as well
[11:06:14] <tw2113> i think the yayquery people need to tie paul irish down long enough
[11:06:40] <```poo> i'll just keep bugging them
[11:06:44] <ajpiano> Goopyo: no, it will not register as its own siblin
[11:06:49] <ajpiano> tw2113: we're all equally flaky :p
[11:07:03] <Goopyo> damn, lemme think
[11:07:16] <jmpdev> is jquery transit the best css3 transition plugin?
[11:08:22] <Goopyo> I can do this > parent (article) > child (news_vote neutral) > span > val (msg) ?
[11:09:31] <```poo> if it works
[11:09:42] * tw2113 is for more yayquery. i think it's the only podcast i have subscribed for in itunes
[11:10:35] <ajpiano> Goopyo: i'm refactoring it a bit for your referenc
[11:10:47] <Goopyo> cool thanks, ill try my end
[11:11:48] <coachz> Does this mean my path is wrong?  http://i.imgur.com/yycVe.jpg
[11:12:13] <ajpiano> Goopyo: http://jsfiddle.net/2QNLd/1/
[11:12:23] <Goopyo> bout to test this: $(item).parent('article').children('.news_vote.neutral').child("span").val(msg)
[11:12:26] <ajpiano> Goopyo: you don't need to do all these special sibling checking for each case
[11:12:42] <ajpiano> just cache all the vote buttons before hand and then use that collection
[11:13:28] <Goopyo> even if there are multiple articles in that "news_container"?
[11:13:44] <ajpiano> hum, then it would be slightly trickier
[11:14:07] <Goopyo> my bad should have posted more html
[11:14:30] <ajpiano> Goopyo: something like this would make it work individually for each article http://jsfiddle.net/2QNLd/2/
[11:19:57] <coachz> Anyone have a sec to look why my gallery isn't working?  http://www.atouchofclassband.com/gallery.php   I'm using this one: http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic/index.html
[11:20:06] <varunaggarwal> hi
[11:22:34] <coachz> i followed all the instructions on the page and made the thumbnails too
[11:22:45] <coachz> the libararies are loading now too
[11:24:14] <RPkS> I'm having asome trouble getting a button to work right on my site. It should fold open like this http://jsfiddle.net/brick11/xUMH5/10/
[11:24:24] <coachz> and the document ready is firing
[11:24:32] <Goopyo> ajpiano: modified it a bit to suit my needs better, check the console no errors, but its still not modifying the value. Did a alert message and it is saying "-1" which is correct
[11:24:37] <Goopyo> http://jsfiddle.net/2QNLd/3/
[11:25:09] <RPkS> My cart uses a styles.css and a colors.css file. and I'm not getting my blue button to work
[11:25:46] <```poo> coachz: you got a weird < on top
[11:25:52] <coachz> ahh sec
[11:26:23] <```poo> not that that's the problem i think
[11:26:42] <coachz> removed it
[11:26:47] <tw2113> i wanna know why coachz has divs and images and </br> tags in the <head> area
[11:27:13] <```poo> coachz you have lots of markup inside the <head>
[11:27:40] <coachz> just my logo, jquery and menu there
[11:28:07] <```poo> why in the <head> ?
[11:28:17] <```poo> and </br> is no logo
[11:28:28] <```poo> <title>A Touch of Class</title>    </br>
[11:28:29] <```poo> ??
[11:28:40] <coachz> where is a good pastebin with syntax highlighting please ?
[11:28:49] <```poo> www.pastebin.com
[11:29:08] <```poo> but it's best if you jsfiddle it
[11:29:21] <coachz> ok, that's my main page  http://pastebin.com/ZFzu8JTD
[11:29:54] <coachz> and my header http://pastebin.com/ucG9kwVg
[11:29:57] <```poo> uh that's your php page
[11:30:04] <```poo> i'm talking about the php's output
[11:30:08] <ajpiano> coachz: you know that the <head> of an html document is not the same as the "header" that's meant to be visible at the top of the rendered page
[11:30:26] <```poo> ^^
[11:30:46] <coachz> i don't think that's my problem though, sec
[11:30:58] <tw2113> invalid markup can have an effect
[11:31:26] <coachz> i removed it
[11:32:19] <coachz> please refresh
[11:32:29] <spoonybard> is there an alternative to firebug for the ubuntu terminal?
[11:33:31] <tw2113> looks like you have your script block outside your </body> tag
[11:33:49] <coachz> ahh does it need to be inside it ?
[11:33:50] <ajpiano> Goopyo: omg. my bad.  you don't use .val() on a span
[11:33:53] <tw2113> linux terminal != browser console
[11:34:00] <tw2113> yes coachz
[11:34:04] <youngin> Eviltwin: hey
[11:34:04] <ajpiano> Goopyo: val is for input elements. for regular elements you use html or text
[11:34:13] <coachz> now it's inside the body tag
[11:34:16] <Goopyo> ahhh
[11:34:17] <Goopyo> k
[11:34:20] <Goopyo> ill try it
[11:34:37] <```poo> coachz its running but that gallery plugin fails: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'find' of undefined
[11:35:05] <tw2113> i got this.$imageContainer is undefined ...lide = this.$imageContainer.find('span.current').addClass('previous').removeClas...
[11:35:14] <g0rd0n> i have a time amount in seconds, however it's not a unix timestamp, rather just a count. so i want this to be outputted as "5 days, 3 hours and 25 minutes" for example... is there a jquery plugin for that?
[11:35:14] <Goopyo> works thanks, ajpiano. The only thing now is toggling the same one on and off but I can prolly work that out
[11:35:15] <coachz> poo,  ahh, so is the gallery broken ?
[11:35:28] <```poo> i dunno
[11:35:56] <Goopyo> ohh thats because item is now the article, not the thing
[11:35:57] <Goopyo> got it
[11:36:32] <Goopyo> wait no nvm thats not true
[11:36:53] <coachz> i thought i set everything up per the instructions here:  http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic/index.html
[11:37:35] <RPkS> Hey Guys I have a little melt down on my live site, can anyone help me?
[11:37:44] <tw2113> from the looks of it, the error i saw came from the plugin itself, not your options settng
[11:38:26] <coachz> ok i guess i'll have to try another gallery, this one appears broken
[11:38:36] <coachz> thanks for checking it out
[11:38:59] <ajpiano> an error like that inside of a reasonably popular plugin is typically indicative of a subtle error in the configuration or the markup
[11:39:11] <tw2113> i say debug and see if you can fix it, check support channels for it on its site, etc
[11:39:20] <RPkS> http://jsfiddle.net/brick11/xUMH5/10/  ...I should have a button that folds open/close like this, but instead I have a mess like this on my website. http://puu.sh/pLOO
[11:39:43] <coachz> tw2113, i don't have the skill for debugging the plugin, but thanks
[11:39:58] <tw2113> and skills aren't just instant things
[11:40:02] <tw2113> you need to refine them
[11:40:04] <coachz> unfortunately
[11:40:04] <tw2113> by tryin
[11:40:11] <tw2113> and spending some time learning
[11:40:53] <klawd_> can i make jquery wait to complete an ajax request before moving on?
[11:41:01] <ParanoidGal> tw2113 i need your help
[11:41:10] <coachz> it helps when you have a clue where to start :-)
[11:41:13] <tw2113> all my life
[11:41:26] <coachz> klawd, put your code in the callback
[11:41:55] <tw2113> firebug is a great place to start
[11:42:12] <coachz> ajpiano, if you find my subtle error please feel free to let me know :-)
[11:42:49] <```poo> coachz: you didnt specify some stuff in the plugin options
[11:43:05] <```poo> for example- imageContainerSel:         '', // The CSS selector for the element within which the main slideshow image should be rendered
[11:43:07] * tw2113 isn't sure what help ParanoidGal needs at the moment
[11:43:20] <ajpiano> `poo: coachz not that it explains why but "copying the entire set of defaults and explicitly providing them" is not necessary
[11:43:34] <ajpiano> `poo: those are the default options
[11:43:41] <```poo> i know
[11:43:43] <ajpiano> if he didn't pass anything, it would use empty string internally
[11:43:48] <ajpiano> so that's not the source of the problem
[11:43:53] <coachz> hmm
[11:43:57] <```poo> well it does seem to be
[11:43:59] <ajpiano> well, likely isn't
[11:44:00] <```poo> from debugging
[11:44:22] <ajpiano> though yeah, that was my initial instinct too ```poo
[11:44:57] <```poo> hm
[11:45:13] <coachz> i changed it to   imageContainerSel:         'slideshow'
[11:45:16] <coachz> no change
[11:45:20] <`poo> coachz: this would all be A LOT easier for us and for you
[11:45:24] <`poo> if you JSFIDDLE IT
[11:45:33] <`poo> properly
[11:45:44] <ajpiano> hmm
[11:45:50] <`poo> so we don't have to wait for you to make the changes..
[11:46:09] <coachz> ok, i can try the jsfiddle if that helps
[11:46:48] <`poo> add the externals using 'add resource'
[11:47:07] <coachz> i've never used it before so it may take a while
[11:47:09] <`poo> also
[11:47:18] <`poo> 'slideshow' would not be a good selector..
[11:47:23] <`poo> what about #slideshow ?
[11:47:49] <coachz> oooh yeah that changed my display
[11:48:12] <coachz> now it's working, i just have to get the thumbs in the right place
[11:48:18] <coachz> nice job poo !
[11:48:18] <`poo> there you go.
[11:48:20] <`poo> tnx
[11:48:31] <`poo> defaults !== valid options
[11:48:38] <coachz> you are so right
[11:48:51] <coachz> i would have assumed defaults would provide a working gallery
[11:48:53] <ajpiano> plugins that break with the default options !== good
[11:48:56] <`poo> me too
[11:48:58] <`poo> agreed
[11:49:54] <yannickoo> How can I put something in images.name? var images ={}; var name = ''; images.name.push('foo');
[11:50:06] <`poo> images.name = 'foo'
[11:50:12] <`poo> ?
[11:51:23] <yannickoo> `poo: but name shoudl be the value from var name
[11:51:25] <ajpiano> yannickoo: that's an array
[11:51:29] <ajpiano> you don't have key names
[11:51:51] <yannickoo> ajpiano: sure i've keys o_ô
[11:51:55] <`poo> yannickoo: what is it you want to achieve
[11:52:06] <ajpiano> yannickoo: that code doesn't make sense as is
[11:52:11] <yannickoo> ajpiano: why not?
[11:52:22] <ajpiano> because an array doesn't have named keys
[11:52:26] <yannickoo> ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/ViJCPtF6
[11:52:51] <ajpiano> yannickoo: use bracket notation
[11:53:04] <ajpiano> images[name] = images[name}++;
[11:53:10] <ajpiano> images[name] = 1;
[11:53:13] <yannickoo> ajpiano: but then i need an array right?
[11:53:16] <ajpiano> no
[11:53:24] <ajpiano> bracket notation works on objects
[11:53:37] <ajpiano> and is the only way to set a dynamic key name from a var for instance
[11:54:22] <yannickoo> ajpiano: thank you man, do you remeber i donated $5 to you
[11:54:29] <`poo> ;D
[11:54:32] <yannickoo> ajpiano: for 2 years
[11:54:38] <ajpiano> ahaha yeah rings a bell
[11:54:48] <yannickoo> ajpiano: :D
[11:54:56] <`poo> was that monthly
[11:55:05] <ajpiano> i don't think so!
[11:55:09] <`poo> ;(
[11:57:28] <FFForever> I'm editing a script that I found and I see  url: "/chat/recvmessage/${chatid}", but chatid isn't defined anywhere... any ideas?
[12:00:18] <johnkpaul> I wish that .pipe() didn't modify the original deferred
[12:00:42] <johnkpaul> because .pipe().pipe().pipe() looks like it would modify the original deferred three times, but it doesn't
[12:01:10] <johnkpaul> does anyone know of a better way to achieve that?
[12:01:18] <johnkpaul> other than three sepearate calls, I like the chaining look :)
[12:01:21] <johnkpaul> separate*
[12:01:51] <`poo> whacha pipin' ??
[12:02:11] <johnkpaul> a deferred from an ajax call through a few other ajax calls
[12:02:47] <johnkpaul> I incorrectly assumed that deferred.pipe().pipe().pipe() would change the original deferred three times, but it really only does it once
[12:02:53] <johnkpaul> only the first pipe
[12:03:19] <coachz> hahah, i'm in it now :-)  http://www.atouchofclassband.com/gallery.php#play
[12:03:43] <yannickoo> ajpiano: but why this doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/WdHWCiVG
[12:04:13] <ajpiano> yannickoo: cause you need it on both sides
[12:04:20] <ajpiano> images[name] = images[name]++;
[12:04:20] <yannickoo> ajpiano: images[name]?
[12:05:07] <yannickoo> ajpiano: no dev tools are freezed, cannot do anything
[12:05:19] <ajpiano> ...
[12:05:26] <ajpiano> i have no idea why that would be the case, restart your browser
[12:05:53] <yannickoo> ajpiano: after close the site and opened it i have the same behavior… this is my current code http://pastebin.com/gqebzyRF
[12:06:32] <ajpiano> i don't know why in the world you'd expect a third party to diagnose something freezing your browser from a static paste of non executing code
[12:06:57] <`poo> images[name] = images[name]++;  ????????????
[12:06:57] <ajpiano> yannickoo: also there's no reason to use a global "name" variable here
[12:07:09] <johnkpaul> `poo: I had the same thought
[12:07:10] <yannickoo> ajpiano: var name in every loop?
[12:07:22] <yannickoo> johnkpaul: hm?
[12:07:27] <ajpiano> yannickoo: yep
[12:07:29] <johnkpaul> images[name] is a number?
[12:07:38] <yannickoo> johnkpaul: and?
[12:07:45] <`poo> i = i++
[12:07:57] <yannickoo> ajpiano: but that's a performance issue right?
[12:08:02] <ajpiano> what, no
[12:08:04] <ajpiano> not at all
[12:08:08] <coachz> poo, any ideas what's offsetting my main slideshow ?  http://www.atouchofclassband.com/gallery.php#play
[12:08:08] <johnkpaul> yannickoo: and nothing, it was just surprising code to read
[12:08:19] <ajpiano> yannickoo: johnkpaul makes a good point
[12:08:21] <ajpiano> you don't need the assignment
[12:08:26] <ajpiano> images[name]++ will do the trick
[12:08:37] <yannickoo> ajpiano: that's my code :s
[12:08:48] <ajpiano> yannickoo: without the images[name] =
[12:08:59] <coachz> found it
[12:09:01] <yannickoo> ajpiano: yeah
[12:09:04] <yannickoo> good idea :s
[12:10:09] <ajpiano> yannickoo: you need to learn a lot about perforamcne if you are doing $(this).attr("href") in a loop, and then worrying that declaring a local var inside that loop is the potential perf problem
[12:10:27] <ajpiano> yannickoo: also it's especially bad with "name"
[12:10:32] <ajpiano> because there already is a global window.name
[12:10:38] <yannickoo> ajpiano: because of name attrivute?
[12:10:40] <yannickoo> right
[12:10:54] <yannickoo> ajpiano: why not $(this).attr('href')?
[12:11:01] <coachz> hmm, nope
[12:11:23] <ajpiano> yannickoo: nothing's wrong with it, i'm just saying that $(this) itself has way more overhead than creating a local variable
[12:11:53] <yannickoo> ajpiano: okay i didn't know that declaring a local variable is okay inside a loop
[12:11:54] <yannickoo> ajpiano++
[12:12:11] <ajpiano> yannickoo: there's a difference between .each and a for loop
[12:12:21] <ajpiano> in a for loop there isn't a new function scope, but in .each there is
[12:13:11] <izual_> Hi, I am trying to transfer some data with json. Firstly, the url of the page being accessed has to return json_encoded data, right? eg a echo json_encode from a php script would do? Secondly how do I handle the returned data, through what name? If I want to have to echo json_encode in one script how is that managed?
[12:13:12] <yannickoo> ajpiano: could you test the code at the site? http://pastebin.com/unp1iav1
[12:15:00] <ajpiano> yannickoo: i can't find the code we're talking about on your site
[12:15:10] <yannickoo> ajpiano: in the pastebin
[12:15:11] <johnkpaul> izual_: if you're responding to an ajax request, yes, echoing a json encoded object from php would work
[12:15:15] <yannickoo> ajpiano: no try it in dev tool
[12:15:17] <johnkpaul> you might also want to set the correct content type header
[12:15:19] <johnkpaul> application/json
[12:15:29] <johnkpaul> the secondly question though, I don't understand
[12:15:31] <ajpiano> yannickoo: omg

[12:15:55] <ajpiano> that is *wrong*

[12:29:27] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/8P6uz/5/ so i've put basically two event handlers on the same button and i'm finding that the second one keeps bubbling up ... http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/8P6uz/27/ how can I stop this?
[12:29:48] <someprimetime> i tried e.stopPropagation() but that did nothing on the second one

[12:34:24] <Nexcius> hi. i am building a web app that is working like a link catalog. i want to be able to browse the content of the external websites in the app. how is this best done? using iframes or loading it into a div? (i need to keep my header and footer)
[12:35:38] <johnkpaul> Nexcius: iframe
[12:36:29] <Nexcius> johnkpaul: do you know if it works as intended on the iPhone?
[12:36:43] <johnkpaul> depends on what "it" is
[12:36:51] <johnkpaul> do iframes work on iPhones, yes
[12:37:05] <Nexcius> that was what i was wondering ;) thank you very much :)
[12:37:45] <johnkpaul> no problem
[12:38:03] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: from your code, I can't understand what you mean
[12:38:58] <someprimetime> johnkpaul: well if you click `edit` the comment will turn into a textbox, then you can edit it... it should save once each time.. if you try it again.. it'll say saved like 3 times then 6 times.. etc
[12:39:14] <johnkpaul> bceause you're adding the handler again
[12:39:25] <johnkpaul> stopPropagation has nothing to do with that
[12:39:34] <johnkpaul> ?unbind @someprimetimeo
[12:39:35] <bot-t> someprimetimeo, .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/

[12:39:55] <someprimetime> but that didn't seem to help
[12:44:47] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: that's an incorrect use of .off
[12:45:03] <johnkpaul> $el.off("click")

[12:58:30] <Mosselmaniac> hi all
[12:59:07] <Mosselmaniac> could somebody help me with this: i have a selector, which is an input element with a key. trying to set the value: $("#verdeling_be[14]").val("hi"); but it is not working
[12:59:19] <ajpiano> ?escaping @ Mosselmaniac
[12:59:20] <bot-t> Mosselmaniac, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[12:59:22] <Mosselmaniac> when i remove the key (and rename the element), it's fine.
[13:00:29] <Mosselmaniac> ajpiano: thx
[13:00:35] <Mosselmaniac> not sure which 1 to take though ;-)
[13:01:15] <rubynfootball> if I have split a string using jquery's split function and then removed the last element of the array with pop, how can I then put the string back together using the character I used to split it with?
[13:02:44] <johnkpaul> jquery has a split function?
[13:03:11] <Mosselmaniac> ajpiano: $("#verdeling_be\\[14\\]").val("hi"); ?
[13:03:27] <Mosselmaniac> Strange, not working.
[13:04:50] <rubynfootball> maybe it's javascript, sry
[13:05:18] <johnkpaul> rubynfootball: you might want to look into Array.prototype.join
[13:05:39] <macmartine> Shouldn't this constructor get called after the dom is loaded? It's getting called before then. It's saying there are 0 objects with that class, but there are two. https://gist.github.com/2394563
[13:08:16] <rubynfootball> johnkpaul: I'm not using prototype, just jquery and js
[13:08:48] <johnkpaul> I didn't say you were using prototype the framework
[13:08:54] <johnkpaul> ?mdn array.prototype.join

[13:24:23] <sayakb> hi, i'm trying to do this: http://paste.kde.org/457610/ -- but it fails. although this -- http://paste.kde.org/457604/ -- works. is my delay syntax wrong?
[13:24:47] <ajpiano> ?delay2 @ sayakb
[13:24:47] <bot-t> sayakb, .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
[13:25:27] <sayakb> ajpiano: ok, is there any jquery function i can use, or some way i can use a cleaner implementation than what i have used?
[13:26:01] <jcp_> is this the wrong approach for injecting json data into html? http://jsfiddle.net/K37bX/1/
[13:26:38] <ajpiano> sayakb: http://paste.kde.org/457616/
[13:27:03] <sayakb> ajpiano: gotcha, thanks!
[13:27:04] <johnkpaul> jcp_: it's a fine approach, but if you're doing that a lot, I'd recommend looking at a js templating library
[13:27:08] <ajpiano> jcp_: it's typical to use a templating enging for this type of thing
[13:27:37] <jcp_> johnkpaul, ajpiano okay, thanks!
[13:28:43] <johnkpaul> jcp_: no problem, take a look at http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/
[13:29:03] <jcp_> oh nice, was just googling for templates but this looks good
[13:29:12] <shoky> ho nice link
[13:30:40] <jcp_> ya that's a good resource bookmarked, thanks again!
[13:34:36] <johnkpaul> no problem, hope you find it usefl
[13:34:39] <johnkpaul> useful*
[13:48:03] <yannickoo> hello again, how shoudl i show the other items? $('.instabumbs a:not([href*="' + date + '"])').hide();
[13:48:24] <shoky> what other items
[13:48:26] <shoky> hello again
[13:48:44] <shoky> oh items.
[13:48:56] <yannickoo> shoky: all items with href *= date
[13:49:52] <yannickoo> $('.instabumbs a:not([href*="' + date + '"])').hide();             $('.instabumbs a[href*="' + date + '"]').show(); doesn't look good
[13:52:52] <shoky> $('.instabumbs a').show().filter(':not(...)').hide()  is one way
[13:52:56] <shoky> there's probably a nicer one
[13:53:19] <shoky> and i guess this isn't functionally the same as yours
[13:53:57] <johnkpaul> what's the goal here? also, is the date actually a Date?
[13:54:08] <ajpiano> yannickoo: you shouldn't use a selector for this
[13:54:19] <ajpiano> yannickoo: you should take advantage of the intial time you filter those elements
[13:54:27] <ajpiano> to cache references to them
[13:54:32] <yannickoo> ajpiano: what should i use?
[13:55:10] <ajpiano> instead of just using that object to count how many there are, you should use it to store collections of jquery elements
[13:55:43] <yannickoo> ajpiano: <3
[13:55:51] <yannickoo> ajpiano: i thought it's to big
[13:56:05] <shoky> its smaller than 3 man
[13:57:19] <ajpiano> yannickoo: something like this http://pastebin.com/cs5kMf1h
[13:57:50] <ajpiano> and then when you need the number you just would do images[date].length
[14:00:07] <Whirl3d> Hey all, anybody interested in looking at a big project and determining giving a bid to do it. It would involve sql, coldfusion, a terrbily constructed database and of course, jquery/ui for the front end.
[14:00:54] <Malediction> Really selling it there:p
[14:01:16] <shoky> hence the bid
[14:01:17] <Whirl3d> I know
[14:02:06] <Whirl3d> The guy is really brilliant, but he has approached this project from the wrong direction and now he has300+ clients that rely on him daily for their businesses.
[14:02:31] <shoky> oh, that guy
[14:02:50] <Whirl3d> right. lol
[14:03:20] <yannickoo> ajpiano: why not images[date].push( $(this) );
[14:03:37] <shoky> it's not an array
[14:03:47] <shoky> it's a jqquery object
[14:04:10] <ajpiano> ^^
[14:04:19] <shoky> initially gets set to 'elem'
[14:06:24] <yannickoo> ajpiano: and how can i manipulate all a's which doesn't appear in the objecT?
[14:06:51] <ajpiano> i don't know, code it?
[14:07:03] <ajpiano> you're asking a question that assumes i know more than i do about your app
[14:07:40] <shoky> is there a way to invert a .find() or a .filter() or anything you can .end()  ?
[14:07:52] <ajpiano> what do you mean by "invert"
[14:08:14] <shoky> all the elements which were in the original selection and weren't in the filtered one
[14:08:25] <shoky> i guess
[14:08:26] <ajpiano> ?not
[14:08:27] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[14:08:31] <yannickoo> ajpiano: i've lot of <a> and i'm storing elements in the images object. how can i manipulate all <a> which doesn't appear in the object?
[14:08:40] <shoky> well, yeah
[14:08:57] <ajpiano> store them somewhere else?
[14:09:06] <shoky> oh .not
[14:10:50] <ajpiano> yannickoo: you can use .not to filter out the elements that appear in the images object from the overall set
[14:11:04] <ajpiano> and then just store a reference to those elems and manipulate them
[14:11:05] <merlin1991> hm got a question about jquery ui, can I somehow tell an accordion to use the screen height as maximum height?
[14:11:22] <shoky> screen?
[14:11:26] <merlin1991> window
[14:11:27] <merlin1991> whatever
[14:11:36] <shoky> you can make it fill its container
[14:11:41] <shoky> by height
[14:11:52] <shoky> some option
[14:12:05] <merlin1991> I'd like to have it autosize up to a maximum of the container :/
[14:12:35] <shoky> i think that's what i meant by 'fill'
[14:12:55] <yannickoo> ajpiano: store a reference?
[14:13:06] <ajpiano> yannickoo: :|
[14:13:08] <ajpiano> like
[14:13:12] <ajpiano> var foo = $(".foo")
[14:13:16] <ajpiano> saving a jquery object to a variable
[14:13:20] <ajpiano> like THE ENTIRE WAY THAT IMAGES OBJECT WORKS
[14:14:38] <yannickoo> ajpiano: and how you wanna use .not ?
[14:15:07] <ajpiano> yannickoo: foo = $("instagram guys").not( images["201204"] )
[14:15:12] <yannickoo> nie
[14:15:15] <yannickoo> nice
[14:15:44] <merlin1991> hm now I'd only have to get the container around it to fill the window height :/
[14:16:49] <ajpiano> $("#accordion").height( $(window).height() ); ?
[14:17:00] <merlin1991> before the fill option the accordion resized itself to a bigger size and thus resized the outer container, but now it doesn't :/
[14:17:29] <yannickoo> ajpiano: $.each(images[date], function() {              $(this).show();            });            $('.instabumbs a').not(images[date]).hide();
[14:20:59] <ML74> Can someone help me with reloading some page content with jQuery? I'm using WordPress.
[14:21:02] <shoky> merlin1991, height:100%;
[14:21:17] <merlin1991> shoky: is scary
[14:21:31] <shoky> this is correct
[14:24:46] <merlin1991> shoky: I'm stuggling as to where to apply the height:100%, I have 3 divs inside body (hidden div with dialogs, header, and "body") inside that body is a tabview which then contains the accordion
[14:25:51] <shoky> ok
[14:26:06] <shoky> do you like the tabview height
[14:26:37] <merlin1991> the tabview actually should span the size of the screen, (apart from the header)
[14:26:48] <shoky> so you dont like it?
[14:26:55] <merlin1991> nope I don't like it
[14:27:07] <shoky> ok , height:100% there, how's that
[14:27:18] <merlin1991> did that, didn't affect it oddly
[14:27:43] <shoky> i dunno man, got a link?
[14:27:53] <merlin1991> I'll try to do fiddle
[14:27:57] <shoky> cool
[14:27:57] <merlin1991> it's a local dev thing :/
[14:28:20] <merlin1991> I BET when I put it on fiddle it works because I left out one silly style somewhere
[14:28:30] <shoky> that's what's great about jsfiddle
[14:28:35] <yannickoo> ajpiano: ?
[14:28:48] <ajpiano> you didn't ask a quesiton, you pasted a line of code
[14:29:34] <merlin1991> hm odd I can't paste into jsfiddle
[14:29:57] <yannickoo> ajpiano: is that a good way to manipulate all items which don't appear in the object
[14:30:06] <yannickoo> -object +object?
[14:30:33] <ajpiano> not really
[14:30:53] <yannickoo> ajpiano: can you show me a better way?
[14:31:04] <ML74> Can someone help me with reloading some page content with jQuery? I'm using WordPress.
[14:31:47] <shoky> do i have to know wordpress to apply?
[14:31:55] <ML74> Probably not :/
[14:32:01] <shoky> then i'm willing to try
[14:32:05] <ML74> I just don't know where to start lol
[14:32:26] <shoky> not something you can fiddle maybe?
[14:33:24] <shoky> yannickoo what is that $.each for
[14:33:26] <ajpiano> yannickoo: this is meant to be all the ones for whom "date"  doesn't exist or what?
[14:33:56] <ML74> shoky: not really
[14:34:02] <shoky> k
[14:34:11] <ML74> shoky: It's for http://www.designbyml.com/washington/
[14:34:15] <yannickoo> show all items which are in the object: $.each(images[date], function() { $(this).show(); });
[14:34:34] <yannickoo> hide all items which aren't in the object: $('.instabumbs a').not(images[date]).hide();
[14:34:38] <shoky> images[date].show()
[14:34:46] <ML74> shoky: When the navigation is hit, I want to change everything above the navigation.
[14:35:00] <yannickoo> shoky: cool
[14:35:25] <ajpiano> yannickoo: or $.each( images, function() { this.show() }); to show the ones for all dates
[14:35:49] <ajpiano> yannickoo: i'm officially out of energy to think about this anymore today
[14:35:49] <ajpiano> sorry
[14:37:08] <shoky> ML74 ok
[14:39:22] <shoky> when you say above the navigation, you mean behind the navigation, yes ?
[14:39:44] <ML74> shoky: Yeah. The images and the content on the right.
[14:40:01] <shoky> btw, when i view it in a small window
[14:40:05] <shoky> you cant scroll the text
[14:40:13] <shoky> it only scrolls the background image
[14:40:52] <shoky> ML74, ok, i'm listening
[14:41:01] <shoky> #jquery is
[14:41:49] <ML74> huh?
[14:42:06] <shoky> you haven't specified your problem
[14:42:33] <shoky> just given a link and said you want something done
[14:42:38] <shoky> i dont see the problem
[14:44:50] <ML74> i need the content to change when i click the navigation. but i can't have the page reloading.
[14:45:14] <shoky> then you probably want ajax
[14:45:23] <ML74> for example, click "the venue" and the content above the navigation changes.
[14:45:27] <shoky> and not plain links like you have now
[14:45:42] <ML74> yeah, i see. is there a good irc channel/
[14:45:44] <ML74> ?
[14:46:00] <shoky> good for what
[14:46:29] <ML74> some help? or can you assist?
[14:46:43] <shoky> i'm trying to..
[14:47:04] <ML74> oh, ok lol
[14:47:10] <ajpiano> ?details @ ML74
[14:47:11] <bot-t> ML74, Please tell us more about your problem. Describe the issue. Paste your code to a pastebin and give us a link to the URL.
[14:47:17] <shoky> you want me to what.. do it for you? tell you what functions to call ???
[14:47:31] <merlin1991> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/8hpAb/
[14:47:35] <ML74> i just want a general idea of what needs to happen.
[14:47:41] <merlin1991> and hey it didn't go away magically :/
[14:47:48] <shoky> then why the hell didn;'t you say so
[14:48:07] <rr3> hi, new to jquery and I am tryingt to understand a jquery plugin.  I am stuck on one line that doesn't make sense.  It seems like a variable is passed an argument like it was actually a function.  It doesn't make sense.  Here is the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/Z0jmVgCL
[14:48:15] <shoky> do you know how to make ajax calls?
[14:48:22] <ML74> :/
[14:48:22] <ML74> no
[14:48:29] <shoky> ok i suggest you read some..
[14:48:34] <shoky> ?.ajax
[14:48:34] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:48:45] <shoky> and experiment some
[14:49:05] <merlin1991> shoky: updated it smallish http://jsfiddle.net/8hpAb/1/
[14:49:10] <shoky> if you dont understand something we'd be delighted to explain
[14:49:20] <shoky> merlin ok sec
[14:52:43] <rr3> hi trying to understand a jquery plugin, can someone explain this code to me:  https://github.com/robcowie/jquery-stopwatch/blob/master/jquery.stopwatch.js  lines 52-54?
[14:53:57] <DOKA> Hello all! I have this HTML structures on page:
[14:53:57] <DOKA> <div class="c0">
[14:53:57] <DOKA>   <div class="c1"/>
[14:53:57] <DOKA>   <div class="c2"> <div class="c3"/> </div>
[14:53:57] <DOKA> </div>
[14:53:57] <DOKA> How can I select all "div.c3" when according "div.c1" exists?
[15:00:23] <rr3> DOKA:  you could do:   if($('div[class="c1"]')) { $('div[class="c3"]')  }
[15:01:19] <shoky> merlin1991 sorry donno the best way to do it
[15:01:19] <stan_man_can> I'm trying to use twitters "typeahead" plugin for bootstrap and it's not working on a mobile phone, any ideas how to get it to work?
[15:01:30] <DOKA> Thank you. I already get it :) I do $(.c1).parent().find(.c3);
[15:01:32] <stan_man_can> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#typeahead for those unfamiliar
[15:01:42] <merlin1991> shoky: actually *any* way to do it would be nice :D
[15:03:19] <shoky> merlin1991 there's this but i don't like it much ;)  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/8hpAb/2/
[15:03:38] <shoky> based off stackoverflow solution
[15:03:50] <shoky> rr3 what don't you get?
[15:05:56] <luke--_> hey there
[15:06:56] <justinhjohnson> luke--_: i feel like you're about to ask me a/s/l
[15:07:11] <rr3> shoky:  in the code, this.data('stopwatch'), data is an object that has many values, but it is passed the argument 'stopwatch' like data is actually a function?
[15:07:47] <luke--_> if I clone an element inside a function with with clone() (save it n a variable) but I do not append it anywhere, what happens with that element when the function ends? Is it gone? Do I have to worry about memory-stuff If I call that function a lot?
[15:07:49] <shoky> ?.data @ rr3
[15:07:49] <bot-t> rr3, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:08:13] <justinhjohnson> functions are objects in js, so maybe that's confusing you, as well
[15:10:35] <stan_man_can> Or is there any way to make an auto-complete work in jquerymobile?
[15:10:43] <rr3> oh okay, so .data is an arbitary store of key,value pairs and this.data('stopwatch') will return the value of the key 'stopwatch'?
[15:11:53] <shoky> yes
[15:13:42] <rr3> okay my other question is on, line 52:  return this.each(function() {}.  From the docs it seems like jquery.each takes a collection to iterate over and the 2nd argument is a function of some sort.
[15:13:52] <shoky> its not jquery.each
[15:13:55] <shoky> its jquery.fn.each
[15:14:00] <rr3> but in this.each(function) what is the arrach of object to tierate?
[15:14:10] <shoky> 'this'
[15:14:27] <shoky> ?.each
[15:14:28] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:14:31] <shoky> ^^
[15:14:42] <shoky> not the same as jQuery.each
[15:14:55] <rr3> okay, thanks guys
[15:15:23] <merlin1991> shoky: I ran with this: http://jsfiddle.net/8hpAb/3/
[15:15:33] <merlin1991> don't ask me about the constants, pure guesswork :D
[15:15:45] <shoky> ;)
[15:16:07] <rr3> I have trouble reading the code, I am not used to this call back type of programming.  thanks for all the help guys
[15:18:23] <merlin1991> ffs it doesn't resize the accordion :/
[15:19:33] <merlin1991> http://jsfiddle.net/8hpAb/4/
[15:19:35] <merlin1991> now it works :D
[15:20:31] <shoky> ;D
[15:20:55] <shoky> i remember using the accordion a while ago where it resized fine without any hackage
[15:21:10] <shoky> maybe i can dig that up
[15:21:28] <shoky> though it wasn't inside tabs
[15:21:33] <merlin1991> well a simple call to it's own accordion 'resize' method worked
[15:21:39] <shoky> ah
[15:21:43] <shoky> maybe that was it ;)
[15:22:28] <justinhjohnson> merlin1991: be sure to bind that resize event to mouse move
[15:22:42] <justinhjohnson> err method, not event
[15:22:43] <justinhjohnson> :D
[15:23:30] <ML74> shoky: This doesn't seem to be working for me :/ http://pastebin.com/ajm3bM6s
[15:23:33] <merlin1991> justinhjohnson: and why would I want todo that? :D
[15:24:09] <justinhjohnson> merlin1991: it was a bad joke. i should /join #sarcasm.
[15:24:19] <justinhjohnson> merlin1991: sorry hehe
[15:24:28] <shoky> it was good until you corrected it ;)
[15:24:41] <shoky> then it got confusing
[15:24:45] <merlin1991> hehe
[15:25:15] <merlin1991> I kinda like jquery + jquery-ui, but I hate webdev with a passion D:
[15:25:21] <merlin1991> s/D:/:D/
[15:25:55] <dospuntocero> Hi guys i have a question… i have a variable with the name of a function… say toCall = "myFunc";
[15:26:24] <dospuntocero> is there a way to call that variable like… toCall();
[15:26:28] <dospuntocero> or something like that?
[15:27:06] <merlin1991> if the function is global can one do document[tpCall]() ?
[15:27:07] <dospuntocero> is it possible?
[15:27:13] * merlin1991 just guesses there
[15:28:13] <dospuntocero> no.. :( it says document[toCall]() is not a function...
[15:28:26] <dospuntocero> maybe i need to convert the result to a string first..
[15:28:54] <shoky> where is the function declared
[15:28:59] <dospuntocero> ahh… no its a string already.
[15:29:19] <dospuntocero> inside the ready function of jquery
[15:29:38] <shoky> uhm and where are you calling it from
[15:29:41] <dospuntocero> and the call is from a jquery obj
[15:29:49] <shoky> in the same scope?
[15:30:02] <dospuntocero> my idea is to have different forms based on radio buttons
[15:30:13] <shoky> ML74, the url passed to .load() is good?
[15:30:13] <dospuntocero> so the client chooses one, and one form is called..
[15:30:16] <shoky> you checked?
[15:30:18] <drakythe> If I'm using an iframe on a site, to snag that site's e-commerce pieces and load them seamlessly onto a particular page, can I see any DOM events from the e-commerce side?
[15:31:08] <merlin1991> dospuntocero: http://jsfiddle.net/ZRAsj/
[15:31:11] <Douglish> Hi everybody, is somehow possible to select last elements of DOM Tree (leaves)?
[15:31:13] <merlin1991> kinda silly though
[15:31:34] <ML74> shoky: I still haven't a clue what I'm doing.
[15:32:44] <ML74> shoky: This is the content code. Basically I need to change the images within #background and the content within #overview.
[15:33:01] <ML74> ** .overview
[15:33:07] <shoky> Douglish, maybe :empty selector
[15:33:17] <shoky> or :last
[15:33:20] <shoky> not sure what you mean
[15:33:33] <shoky> ML74, change it to what?
[15:33:41] <ML74> the content of the new page
[15:33:51] <ML74> i have the image names in custom fields
[15:34:01] <ML74> and the content as the_content()
[15:34:18] <shoky> uhh
[15:35:03] <dospuntocero> @Merlin1991 thanks!! that worked perfectly for my job :) thanks so much
[15:35:37] <shoky> ML74, what is this new content
[15:35:45] <shoky> is it a new page you wanna load from the server?
[15:35:45] <ML74> new text just
[15:35:50] <ML74> yeah, basically
[15:35:50] <shoky> or something you already have in the page
[15:35:56] <ML74> it's wordpress. so from the server.
[15:36:00] <_helpPlz_> hi guys; i was wondering if its possible to check if ajax is in progress? consider this my js is loaded in between ajax request?
[15:36:17] <shoky> do you know the url to get this content
[15:36:29] <shoky> i donno what you were doing there with the location.hash ..
[15:36:36] <merlin1991> dospuntocero: I would just try to keep the functions outside of document, I'd suggest to have some other var that is in scope always to use for that
[15:36:41] <ML74> i think that code is junk
[15:36:53] <ML74> the url depends on which of the navigation buttons is clicked
[15:36:53] <shoky> why gimme junk :(
[15:37:42] <shoky> ok so make sure you get the correct url for each button press..
[15:37:54] <shoky> you can console.log() anything you want
[15:38:12] <shoky> and see if it matches what you expect/need
[15:38:25] <shoky> then when you have the right url
[15:38:34] <shoky> .load() should .. do something
[15:38:35] <shoky> ;)
[15:38:42] <drakythe> Perhaps I should explain my DOM situation. For reasons above my paygrade I have 2 sites that should be one, so I'm iframing one into the other where needed. Site A, the main site, and Site B, the iframed one. Is it possible to effect a change on Site A when something in Site B is clicked? (No, I cannot later Site B myself... *sigh*) possibly using .bind()?
[15:38:43] <ML74> :/
[15:38:49] <ML74> i'm completely lost here
[15:38:50] <shoky> wat
[15:38:58] <shoky> pm me if ya want ;S
[15:39:02] <drakythe> s/later/alter*
[15:39:31] <Douglish> shoky: If you imagine elements as tree, I want leafs
[15:39:42] <shoky> elements without child elements
[15:39:44] <shoky> :empty
[15:44:21] <Douglish> shoky: thanks
[15:44:57] <shoky> np
[16:23:58] * tw2113 drops a pin

[16:26:35] <_helpPlz_> hey is there any way to check if ajax is active if js is loaded in between $.ajax call?
[16:35:53] <shoky> _helpPlz_ maybe you wanna look at .ajaxStart() and .ajaxStop()
[16:37:36] <Hangerbab> Can anyone help me out with a small image swap click function? My brain hurts from cramming a website

[16:38:52] <Hangerbab> http://jsfiddle.net/9gqsX/ just seeing if anyone could take a look at what i wrote and tell me why its not swapping the src of an image correctly
[16:38:53] <Hangerbab> please ;)
[16:39:57] <Hangerbab> actually it is working just fine
[16:39:59] <Hangerbab> disregard :p
[16:44:30] <_helpPlz_> shoky: i did lookup those, and .ajaxComplete and others but, how to check if ajax is active if js is loaded in between?
[16:44:44] <_helpPlz_> i mean after $.ajax was started
[16:49:03] <_helpPlz_> i guess only way possible is to use .ajaxStart() before .ajax()?
[16:56:00] <Tasser> $(function() { ... }) is onload?
[16:57:01] <imsky> doo do doo
[16:59:07] <Nexcius> Tasser: if you are thinking about the document on load, it is $(document).ready(function() {...});
[16:59:21] <Tasser> $(document).ready(handler)
[16:59:24] <Tasser> $().ready(handler) (this is not recommended)
[16:59:26] <Tasser> $(handler)
[17:10:12] <shoky> _helpPlz_ of course, both ajaxStart() and ajaxStop() before any ajax requests you care about
[17:12:32] <Pushnell> Hey all.  I'm a bit of a jquery noob here, writing my first jqueryui plugin.  How can I select this.element's nth-child from within the plugin?
[17:12:57] <shoky> ?nth-child
[17:12:57] <bot-t> :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[17:13:35] <Pushnell> right, but I'm not sure how to target this.element within the selector
[17:13:43] <_helpPlz_> shoky: i went through jquery code just now regarding ajax, i expected there would have been another variable/object that would be set/modified at ajaxStop() ?
[17:14:15] <Pushnell> (I know how to use nth-child outside of a plugin....)
[17:14:22] <_helpPlz_> i mean at .ajax()
[17:14:24] <shoky> this.element.find(':nth-child') or something
[17:14:35] <Pushnell> shoky: cool, I'll play with that.  thanks.
[17:14:56] <shoky> _helpPlz_ there's $.active
[17:14:59] <shoky> undocumented
[17:15:12] <shoky> but, the idea is that you set your own variable
[17:15:17] <_helpPlz_> shoky: thanks for the pointer i would look for it
[17:15:18] <shoky> in ajaxStart and ajaxStop
[17:15:35] <toddWork> i think an _ ( and other special characters) is breaking my ajax request string.
[17:15:49] <shoky> me too
[17:15:51] <toddWork> how do i encode that?
[17:17:00] <shoky> don't think it needs special encoding
[17:17:32] <shoky> encodeURI() maybe..
[17:17:39] <shoky> for the other ones
[17:17:53] <toddWork> ok. thanks shoky
[17:22:15] <tomlikestorock> I'm making an ajax call that responds with a 301 redirect. I want to not follow the 301 redirect, but instead just read the url I'm being forwarded to. How do I do that?

[17:28:29] <micheas> does anyone know of a good jquery and css tutorial on z-indexes? (I need to put a transparent div behind an element while it has focus so that I don't have a race condition of something opening before the field finishes closing)
[17:29:17] <lsone> If I am doing a POST to an API that pulls up an xml, using only html and jquery, how can i convert it into a page?
[17:30:01] <coldhead> micheas: i can't think of a tutorial of that specificity, it would be more a trial and error thing
[17:30:05] <lsone> it does the POST, and the xml page pops up. i want to catch that page, and use the data in my own site, but it can only be done with html and query >.<
[17:30:14] <coldhead> there's not much to know about z-indexes, they're just fiddly
[17:32:27] <micheas> coldhead: I guess I sort of need some detailed docs so I can figure out how to grab the current position correctly, and set it on the page to the exact same place with a higher z-index than anything else. I also need to figure out what the highest z-index is so that i can put my transparent background above it.
[17:32:36] <_helpPlz_> lsone: .parseXML() are you looking for this?
[17:32:39] <micheas> z-indexes are my weak point in css
[17:33:14] <coldhead> micheas: to get the highest index you have to iterate over every element in the page >: |

[17:33:29] <someprimetime> i mean try to edit/save a couple times
[17:33:36] <lsone> will parsexml work even if i don't know the exact url of the data until the POST has happened?
[17:33:46] <coldhead> the highest z-index for a particular position in the page is much trickier
[17:33:47] <micheas> lsone: .ajax() accpets xml as a return datatype, and you can just write the tokenized xml to the dom as needed.
[17:34:15] <someprimetime> i added $that.off('click').on('click', function() {}).. but that prevented the comment getting replaced by the textbox
[17:34:29] <bobsomebody> micheas, you might also want find examples that explain the usage of $(this) insead of $('.class') or $('#id')
[17:34:59] <lsone> hmm this might work
[17:35:01] <lsone> *might* lol
[17:36:42] <micheas> bobsomebody: I have slowly figured out how $(this) works, (some documentation, some experiments, and once even capitalizing on how it changes in a recursive function!)
[17:37:31] <bobsomebody> awesome, basically what you would want to do is use $(this) then traverse the html to find the associated div you want to change
[17:39:01] <micheas> bobsomebody: for some reason z-indexes scare me because I can never get the to behave the way I want, and have always found other ways to do things, unfortunately, this is only solvable with z-indexes, so I get to learn something new today.)
[17:39:19] <bobsomebody> for instance, if you had a text input followed by a div, wrapped in a div you could then do $(this).parent('div.class').find('div.transparent').css()
[17:39:31] <bobsomebody> the trick is going to be getting it in the right spot
[17:39:55] <bobsomebody> I assume you want to cover things with a div so they cant be clicked or something along those lines correct?
[17:40:11] <micheas> bobsomebody, correct.
[17:40:33] <bobsomebody> be weary of flash around z-index's, if you dont have flash dont worry about it then
[17:42:41] <micheas> basically, I have a nice little ajax editable field in drupal, but the auto save when the field loses focus fires after instead of before the other items javascript, but inconsistently across browsers, so this is my solution.
[17:43:00] <micheas> to stop the race condition.
[17:43:01] <shoky> <3 z-indexes
[17:43:11] <shoky> indices?
[17:43:20] <bobsomebody> micheas, have you tried gathering the info in a multipart ajax form?
[17:43:38] <shoky> m m m m m m multiiipart
[17:43:45] <bobsomebody> just get all the other info first
[17:43:53] <bobsomebody> l l l lol
[17:44:03] <shoky> yea man
[17:44:31] <micheas> the form works the way I want > 90% of the time, I am just trying to kill a race condition.
[17:45:26] <beancurd> micheas: why are you trying to kill off a race?
[17:45:28] <beancurd> :(
[17:45:31] <bobsomebody> so you just want to slip one big div under it and cover everything else?
[17:45:36] <coldhead> that's what hitler did :(
[17:45:37] <micheas> The issue is that if the form is multipart it gets a save button, if the form has one field the submit button is camouflaged.
[17:45:48] <bobsomebody> lol gotta love #jquery
[17:45:56] <coldhead> AND WE DO
[17:45:59] <coldhead> <33
[17:46:03] <bobsomebody> yes, yes we do
[17:46:11] <lsone> parsexml hates me
[17:46:17] <micheas> coldhead, this isn't news, there is no godwin rule.
[17:46:47] <shoky> only godwins
[17:47:08] <beancurd> don't bring religion into this!
[17:47:26] <shoky> o shiat
[17:47:37] <beancurd> NO 'E DIDNT
[17:48:09] <lsone> when doing parsexml, what is the var xml ="" part supposed to be set as? that has to be where i am messing this up ...
[17:48:46] <lsone> i have the $xml = $( "url to xml doc" )
[17:49:07] <shoky> url?
[17:49:21] <shoky> what var xml?
[17:49:24] <lsone> can't use urls in that? >.>
[17:49:31] <lsone> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[17:49:35] <lsone> right off of that page.
[17:49:38] <bobsomebody> micheas, z-index in jquery will be frustrating but still the right way to go in this case
[17:49:44] <shoky> oh, in the example
[17:49:51] <shoky> its just an example, you know
[17:50:09] <bobsomebody> optionally you could try append and just build the div on the fly instead of hard code
[17:50:11] <lsone> yea, and if i can get the data pulled then i can work with it from there, but i can't get t to even pull data
[17:50:16] <shoky> well there's no url to xml doc there
[17:50:20] <shoky> there's just .. xml
[17:50:33] <shoky> so to your original question..
[17:50:36] <lsone> $xml = $( xmlDoc ) <-- can't use a url as the xml doc?
[17:50:42] <shoky> var xml = "<YOUR><XML></H>"
[17:50:54] <shoky> no
[17:50:57] <shoky> no url.
[17:51:10] <lsone> so ajax call the xml doc and pass that in i guess ...
[17:51:12] <micheas> bobsomebody: I already spent several hours trying to figure out why it didn't work with IE9 and the dev version of chrome to discover that I had to camouflage instead of hide the submit button.
[17:51:16] <shoky> what ajax?
[17:51:21] <lsone> i really hate this api i am having to use.
[17:51:23] <shoky> you said xml.
[17:51:35] <shoky> jquery?
[17:51:47] <jcp_> is it a bad idea to use eval() in this instance: http://jsfiddle.net/fk7e2/
[17:51:51] <lsone> right, i am pulling from an api that uses post/get
[17:52:04] <lsone> and when you do it, it returns as an xml page
[17:52:14] <shoky> ok so you need to get that xml page
[17:52:24] <lsone> and since this is eventually going into a phone gap application I can only use html and jquery
[17:52:27] <shoky> $.get for example. or $.ajax
[17:52:34] <lsone> which is what i said ;)
[17:52:54] <lsone> use ajax to pull the xml, and pass the returned xml into the parsexml
[17:52:55] <shoky> well it's pretty easy with jquery
[17:53:00] <shoky> maybe if you read some docs you'll know
[17:53:14] <bobsomebody> lsone, could it be a cross domain issue? as far as i know you cant ajax something on a different domain from the one you're on with javascript in general (could be wrong though)
[17:53:43] <lsone> i read dozens of parsexml pages and they were pretty much crap for what i am needing to do.
[17:54:09] <shoky> because what you need to do is $.get
[17:54:11] <shoky> or $.ajax
[17:54:14] <shoky> so read about those
[17:54:32] <lsone> which i am already doing, and i thank you for pointing me in the right direction :)
[17:54:54] <shoky> uh.good. i think
[17:57:08] <shoky> jcp_ no
[17:57:14] <shoky> er i mean yes, it is a bad idea
[17:57:31] <jcp_> shoky: lol for a second i was like, oh good. hmm, how would i execute that code then?
[17:57:53] <shoky> well
[17:58:05] <shoky> you have no control over the data-json attribute?
[17:58:14] <jcp_> shoky:  i have complete control
[17:58:21] <shoky> ok then it shouldn't contain any code
[17:58:32] <shoky> instead of d['one']
[17:58:38] <shoky> put just 'one'
[17:58:40] <shoky> for example..
[17:59:07] <shoky> then.. _this.html( d[json] )
[17:59:27] <shoky> btw that is not json ;)
[17:59:39] <shoky> methinks
[17:59:46] <jcp_> shoky: ohh, hah, that is better.
[18:00:40] <shoky> using eval is almost always a bad idea
[18:00:59] <shoky> i think it sums up to: if you can avoid it, it's a bad idea
[18:01:11] <jcp_> shoky: is it improperly formatted?
[18:01:25] <shoky> d['one']      <--- that's not json
[18:01:29] <shoky> ['one']   is json
[18:01:49] <shoky> {d:['one']}   is json
[18:01:52] <shoky> etc..
[18:01:55] <jcp_> gotcha
[18:02:23] <shoky> what i mean is, you should change the attribute name ;)
[18:02:31] <jcp_> haha just did, thanks again
[18:02:37] <shoky> ;)
[18:37:33] <micheas> I have actually had pretty good luck calling xml files from yahoo on my own website. the issue I tend to see is having multiple sources for the javascript, but the data seems to be fine.
[18:44:51] <lsone> does $.get not work with remote servers either?
[18:45:12] <lsone> $.ajax I know is local only, but i thought $.get would work
[18:45:25] <shoky> $.get uses $.ajax i think
[18:45:31] <lsone> ouch
[18:47:21] <lsone> there has to be a way to do this.
[18:47:29] <tehlulz> $.get and $.post is the same as writing $.ajax to do a post/get request
[18:47:54] <shoky> yuhp
[18:48:49] <tehlulz> the issue you are experiencing is refered to as Cross Domain requests
[18:49:08] <tehlulz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3506208/jquery-ajax-cross-domain
[18:50:29] <lsone> And those answers suck.
[18:50:38] <lsone> This is pulling from a server that I have 0 access to.
[18:50:46] <tehlulz> LOL
[18:50:50] <tehlulz> you have 0 access to the server?
[18:50:56] <tehlulz> and you're expecting the ajax request to work?
[18:50:56] <lsone> I am pulling from the EVE API.
[18:51:03] <tehlulz> hrm
[18:51:11] <lsone> Which means that I do post/get requests and they return xml
[18:51:45] <tehlulz> and you're sending your API key?
[18:51:50] <lsone> yes
[18:51:56] <lsone> i can get the xml to work just fine
[18:52:00] <lsone> just not in this context
[18:52:32] <lsone> I've worked extensively with the api, just never to the point that i could only use jquery and html to access and use it.
[18:52:59] <lsone> and since this is going into a phonegap application, that is how it has to be.
[18:53:25] <tehlulz> so just the jquery ajax request wont get the xml?
[18:53:32] <tehlulz> can you submit a jsfiddle?
[18:55:51] <Tasser> what's a nice plugin to show a magnified version of the underlying image?
[18:56:00] <lsone> all it is is the .get with the url and function. the actual problem happens with the return in the browser, gives the line 1 column 1 error
[18:56:04] <Tasser> from 150x80 to 300x160
[18:56:19] <lsone> which the all-knowing google says that it is because ajax can't pull from the remote server
[18:56:24] <lsone> so i need to work around its remoteness
[18:56:25] <Tasser> either in a popup or in a predefined location
[18:56:39] <tehlulz> Isone, im sorry im not being much help. With out seeing it, its kind of hard to try help point you in the right direction
[18:56:45] <shoky> line 1 column 1?
[18:57:05] <lsone> XML Parsing Error: no element found Location: moz-nullprincipal:{7893abdf-0b3e-a549-a5bd-3a48a3106787} Line Number 1, Column 1:
[18:57:17] <shoky> o.o
[18:57:19] <lsone> returns 200 OK and throws that error in firebug
[18:57:31] <shoky> uh
[18:57:31] <lsone> which is a known error when pulling from a remote host
[18:57:34] <shoky> is it xml?
[18:57:37] <lsone> yes
[18:58:06] <shoky> how are you parsing it
[18:58:13] <lsone> no parsing is happening
[18:58:17] <lsone> I'm not even using the data
[18:58:23] <shoky> derp
[18:58:29] <lsone> so it isn't a parsing error
[18:58:31] <shoky> when exactly does that error happen?
[18:58:42] <lsone> on the GET
[18:58:47] <shoky> yeah, when
[18:58:56] <tehlulz> like
[18:58:58] <tehlulz> in the callback?
[18:59:06] <tehlulz> parsing of it?
[18:59:16] <lsone> http://jsfiddle.net/KChLb/
[18:59:24] <lsone> not in the parse, there is no parse, at all.
[18:59:39] <lsone> it literally can not get the xml, even though it throws the 200 OK
[19:01:09] <lsone> whoever posted http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3506208/jquery-ajax-cross-domain was right, and i know this is the problem, but my workaround can not involve editing anything server-side
[19:01:13] <lsone> it has to be done locally
[19:02:56] <shoky> that XML Parsing Error
[19:02:59] <shoky> where do you see it?
[19:03:10] <lsone> firebug console
[19:03:29] <shoky> when you run the code in your fiddle?
[19:03:55] <tehlulz> lol
[19:03:57] <tehlulz> if thats your code
[19:04:04] <tehlulz> you're not providing a userId or keyid?
[19:04:29] <shoky> becuase from what i can find about that XML Parsing error..
[19:04:36] <shoky> it's server side
[19:04:39] <shoky> ASP.net..
[19:04:50] <lsone> http://jsfiddle.net/KChLb/1/
[19:04:52] <shoky> so,............ whut?
[19:04:53] <tehlulz> who uses xml these days :P
[19:04:55] <lsone> there we go, that is all updated
[19:05:05] <lsone> and it throws it in firebug on fiddle now
[19:05:28] <shoky> i get XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://api.eve-online.com/account/Characters.xml.aspx. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[19:05:33] <shoky> in chrome..
[19:05:38] <lsone> right
[19:05:47] <lsone> which is the remote server issue with ajax
[19:05:57] <tehlulz> thats what I get too
[19:06:07] <shoky> yea but do you get that when you run your fiddle?
[19:06:09] <lsone> i can't turn that control on, on the server side, so i need to be able to just use the post/get result
[19:06:35] <lsone> nah, in fiddle it just does the 200 ok parsing error
[19:06:43] <shoky> huh.
[19:06:56] <shoky> 200 ok? where do you see 200 ok?
[19:06:58] <tehlulz> ^ what he said
[19:07:03] <tehlulz> im not getting any 200 status
[19:07:04] <lsone> firebug console
[19:07:11] <lsone> http://jsfiddle.net/KChLb/1/
[19:07:13] <lsone> on that
[19:07:17] <shoky> in the console? who is outputting to the console?
[19:07:45] <lsone> firebug consoles all connection requests and returns
[19:08:09] <shoky> i dont use firebug but that doesnt sound like a console
[19:08:56] <lsone> it says hey, we found it! oh, but we couldn't get it because ajax doesn't allow that, unless you modify the request server-side
[19:08:59] <micheas> lsone: here is some ajax I wrote that grabs data from yahoo. (which is returned as xml) http://jsfiddle.net/HMf3L/ that might help you.
[19:09:32] <shoky> lsone... where exactly do you see that xml parsing error :\
[19:09:47] <shoky> SCREENSHOT PLZ
[19:11:00] <lsone> http://imgur.com/tjgPT
[19:11:21] <lsone> http://i.imgur.com/tjgPT.png *minus all the imgur crap
[19:11:36] <shoky> whats in the response tab?
[19:11:54] <shoky> what's in the headers tab?
[19:12:05] <shoky> what's in the errors tab?
[19:12:11] <shoky> er forget errors
[19:13:17] <lsone> http://i.imgur.com/fcOPw.png
[19:13:22] <lsone> nada in the rest of the tabs
[19:13:39] <lsone> just headers and xml
[19:13:51] <lsone> no other errors or info being thrown in the page
[19:14:16] <shoky> looks like the request was fine..
[19:14:28] <shoky> the server isnt spitting out any xml it seems
[19:14:42] <shoky> im no ajax pro but thats what it looks like to me
[19:14:43] <lsone> paste the url into a browser and you will see otherwise
[19:15:05] <lsone> granted that is the error xml because it has no api key, but it is xml none-the-less
[19:15:28] <shoky> like i said im no ajax pro ;)
[19:16:23] <imachuchu> is there an easy way if I attach a jquery command (.blur for example) to a class of elements to find out the name of the exact one that called the target function?
[19:16:26] <lsone> if i could just use my php backend i have built for this, it would be much better, but you can't pull and show remote pages on app store. you can use data, but not the actual pages >.>
[19:19:17] <shoky> imachuchu whatcha mean?
[19:21:20] <imachuchu> I attach a " $( ".nodcBlurSubmit" ).blur(function(){ " to a bunch of fields, and I would then like to be able to tell which one actually triggered, if that makes sense
[19:21:44] <tehlulz> imachuchu
[19:21:49] <tehlulz> use something like:
[19:22:06] <tehlulz> $( ".nodcBlurSubmit" ).blur(function(){  alert($(this).val()); }
[19:22:56] <imachuchu> tehlulz: ok I'll see what it outputs and see if I can use it. Thanks, and you too shoky
[19:23:27] <tehlulz> using $(this) inside the handler will mean that it will only happen with the item triggering it
[19:30:05] <ZeuZ> Hey all, I've got a problem. My PHP script returns valid HTML code, however when I try to apply the reply to body, CSS properties seem not applied. If I refresh, it'll be applied however that's not the desired effect.
[19:30:51] <ZeuZ> the stylesheet is still referenced in head if I view-source it
[19:31:58] <aeiou> is there a simple event i can bind to, so i can get the element that has failed html5 validation?
[19:37:05] <shoky> the html5 element?
[19:37:50] <aeiou> html5 element?
[19:38:11] <shoky> uhhuh
[19:38:31] <aeiou> im trying to find out what element did not pass validation, i.e browser (html5) validation
[19:38:39] <micheas> lsone: the error message does not start with <xml> the error message is not valid xml.
[19:38:45] <aeiou> i need to know what element failed, so i can show a tab if it is not visible
[19:38:54] <lsone> micheas: yea
[19:39:19] <lsone> i found the issue on the eve forums, and they said the same thing. ajax can't handle cross domain like that, unless it is allowed server-side
[19:39:56] <micheas> lsone: so the xml parser is failing on <eveapi
[19:40:06] <lsone> the work-around is doing php backend to parse the data, but i technically can't do that either, due to the fact that this is going on a phonegap application
[19:40:20] <lsone> where is xml parsing actually happening though O.o
[19:40:23] <shoky> quite a gap
[19:40:40] <lsone> the get isn't doing any parsing at all, just trying to do a get with no work done
[19:40:59] <micheas> lsone: the only workaround, I can see is to tell jquery that it is fetching an html page and parse that.
[19:41:23] <lsone> i will try that, how do i change data type in .get? i noticed it in .ajax
[19:42:01] <lsone> i can parse html fairly easily, so no big deal there, i just want my datas! lol
[19:42:02] <shoky> ?get @ lsone
[19:42:03] <bot-t> lsone, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[19:42:06] <shoky> er
[19:42:10] <shoky> ?$.get @ lsone
[19:42:12] <bot-t> lsone, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[19:44:23] <micheas> lsone: from the .ajax help: "If a request with jQuery.get() returns an error code, it will fail silently unless the script has also called the global .ajaxError() method. Alternatively, as of jQuery 1.5, the .error() method of the jqXHR object returned by jQuery.get() is also available for error handling."
[19:44:36] <micheas> sounds exactly like what you are facing.
[19:46:03] <lsone> alright, doing some more testing
[19:49:11] <lsone> apparently ajax is too smart to let me set the data type to html because it gets xml headers
[19:55:27] <lsone> i wonder why they would allow cross-domain jsonp, but none of the other types. that's rather frustrating.
[20:03:53] <bobsomebody> lsone, have you thought of using a php file to bridge the data? basically have it fetch the file with get_stream_contents() in php and parse the xml, then you could pass the data onto ajax as though it where on your domain.
[20:04:28] <bobsomebody> in theory you could convert it to json or a host of other things
[20:06:13] <Whirl3d> does anybody know of a bbs-like system or group-discussion/forum like system that uses jquery for the front end?
[20:12:09] <someprimetime> yo try to edit this a couple times.. http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/8P6uz/29/ how can i prevent it from triggering multiple times?
[20:15:10] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, take the handler assignment for $that out of your other handler.
[20:15:21] <Whirl3d> You are assigning it again every time you edit
[20:15:28] <Whirl3d> you only want to assign it once.
[20:15:34] <Whirl3d> then show/hide it
[20:17:15] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: not sure if that'll work though
[20:17:28] <Whirl3d> I would probably assign the click handler to the parent element, then add a class to the Edit/Save button that could be selected for in the handler. If ($(e.target).is(".saveButton")) { do save functions, $(e.target).removeClass("saveButton");) else { do edit function)
[20:17:30] <someprimetime> basically i want to assign an event to the same button again after it's clicked
[20:17:37] <someprimetime> yeah
[20:17:39] <someprimetime> that's a good method
[20:17:44] <someprimetime> i'm gonna re-write it
[20:17:45] <someprimetime> thanks
[20:17:50] <Whirl3d> np
[20:18:18] <Whirl3d> If you want to do it the way you are now, just namespace your events, bind them and unbind them,
[20:19:20] <coldhead> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/8P6uz/30/
[20:19:24] <Whirl3d> So, rather than $(btn).on("click", btn, do something).....try $(btn).bind("click,editButton", function () {$(btn).unbind("click.editbutton").bind("click.saveButton", function ()....
[20:19:32] <coldhead> if ur feeling lazy, just replace on() with one()
[20:19:43] <coldhead> works for me <3
[20:20:12] <Whirl3d> coldhead, I would have never thought of that, cool
[20:20:13] <someprimetime> coldhead: yeah that works to an extent
[20:20:18] <someprimetime> try it a few times
[20:20:26] <coldhead> no, you can't make me
[20:20:26] <someprimetime> it'll "save" right when clicking edit again
[20:20:26] <ZeuZ> Whirl3d, isn't .on() recomended since .bind() and .live() are going to get deprecated?
[20:20:35] <someprimetime> ╮ (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.) ╭
[20:20:43] <coldhead> yeah it fixes it about as well as one character should :P
[20:20:44] <Whirl3d> is .bind going to be depracated?
[20:20:49] <coldhead> fix it proper, Whirl3d style
[20:20:59] <someprimetime> yeah i'll go with his advice gracias
[20:21:09] <coldhead> supposedly, Whirl3d
[20:21:13] <coldhead> many years from now
[20:21:16] <someprimetime> bind is getting deprecated?
[20:21:18] <someprimetime> weird
[20:21:19] <coldhead> jQuery 3 probably
[20:21:28] <Whirl3d> Well, you can still namespace events using "on" can't you?
[20:21:29] <someprimetime> anyone here going to jquery con in SF?
[20:21:40] <coldhead> someprimetime: bind/live etc are using on() internally now
[20:21:43] <coldhead> on is the future
[20:21:49] <shoky> on is the shit
[20:21:50] <shoky> on is on
[20:21:57] <coldhead> on is on fire
[20:21:57] <someprimetime> coldhead: right yeah i use on pretty much exlusively
[20:22:08] <ZeuZ> lol
[20:22:17] <ZeuZ> Oh, I forgot why I came to the channel
[20:22:21] <ZeuZ> Hey all, I've got a problem. My PHP script returns valid HTML code, however when I try to apply the reply to body, CSS properties seem not applied. If I refresh, it'll be applied however that's not the desired effect.
[20:22:24] <coldhead> for good times
[20:22:25] <shoky> LoL.
[20:22:28] <Whirl3d> again, can't you still use namespacing with .on
[20:22:42] <coldhead> you got a demo of this somewhere, ZeuZ?
[20:22:47] <coldhead> because it's working in my imagination
[20:22:52] <shoky> hah
[20:22:52] <ZeuZ> coldhead, yeah, gimme a second
[20:22:54] <coldhead> need some of that stone cold reality
[20:23:04] <coldhead> tasting of bread
[20:23:12] <ZeuZ> 190.17.102.248
[20:23:17] <ZeuZ> lemme create a test user for you
[20:23:28] <coldhead> this is getting pretty involved
[20:23:35] <ZeuZ> coldhead xD
[20:23:41] <ZeuZ> don't worry it's just so you can see that
[20:23:51] <ZeuZ> in all reality, you can see all the code with just seing that
[20:23:51] <shoky> i want a user!
[20:24:01] <coldhead> we'll share, shoky
[20:24:07] <shoky> ohhh
[20:24:14] <coldhead> in fact, you go first
[20:24:17] <coldhead> i'm afraid
[20:24:21] <shoky> me too ;D
[20:24:25] <Whirl3d> Zeuz, are you using .html(replytext) or are you appending using $(reply).appendTo('body") ?
[20:25:00] <ZeuZ> Whirl3d, $("body").html()
[20:25:05] <shoky> Usuario o clave invalidas.
[20:25:06] <ZeuZ> Whirl3d, $("body").html(reply)
[20:25:24] <ZeuZ> shoky what user and password did you try? :P
[20:25:29] <shoky> coldhead xD
[20:25:36] <ZeuZ> xD
[20:25:38] <ZeuZ> test:test
[20:25:40] <Whirl3d> Have you tried $('body').contents().remove().append($(reply));
[20:25:41] <coldhead> oh THAT guy
[20:25:44] <someprimetime> coldhead: did you sign the NDA yet?
[20:25:47] <shoky> ;D
[20:25:59] <shoky> so its not my own user? (and coldhead's)
[20:26:08] <ZeuZ> Whirl3d, not really, wouldn't have thought so
[20:26:45] <coldhead> ZeuZ: your CSS is in <body>
[20:26:51] <coldhead> and when you replace it, bye bye CSS
[20:26:55] <coldhead> move it to <head>
[20:27:22] <ZeuZ> how comes? the CSS is included in head, check it here:
[20:27:37] <coldhead> <head></head>
[20:27:41] <coldhead> that's what i see in the head
[20:27:44] <coldhead> at http://190.17.102.248/
[20:27:49] <ZeuZ> http://pastebin.com/xkiQxjMr
[20:28:01] <coldhead> and <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Estilos.css"> is in html > body
[20:28:37] <coldhead> dude view-source:http://190.17.102.248/
[20:28:47] <coldhead> you can't put your login form in <head>
[20:28:54] <coldhead> it upsets the browser
[20:28:57] <ZeuZ> it's not
[20:28:57] <coldhead> it's doing the best it can
[20:29:04] <ZeuZ> xD
[20:29:05] <coldhead> oh I AM JUST MAKING IT UP AM I
[20:29:26] <ZeuZ> the form is called later, check the pastebined source
[20:29:27] <tw2113> coldhead do you have a head cold?
[20:29:41] <tw2113> :D
[20:29:43] <coldhead> the pastebinned source is what we call BOLLOCKS
[20:29:44] <ZeuZ> although I don't understand why the stylesheet has moved
[20:29:53] <coldhead> because it's got PHP in it
[20:30:00] <coldhead> i am going off what actually makes it to the browser
[20:30:07] <coldhead> a la view-source:http://190.17.102.248/
[20:30:24] <tw2113> php order doesn't necessarily equal rendered page
[20:30:30] <ZeuZ> thing is if I use view-source:localhost (as this is the same host) I see it correct, in head.
[20:30:46] <coldhead> http://pastebin.com/cjc09xmm
[20:30:48] <coldhead> that's what i see
[20:30:53] <coldhead> <html><div>
[20:30:59] <coldhead> the browser is in tears
[20:31:06] <coldhead> and guesses as best as it can
[20:31:10] <coldhead> and guesses wrong
[20:31:12] * tw2113 confirms the same
[20:31:14] <coldhead> but who can blame it
[20:31:34] <coldhead> it sees the div and goes "oh shit we must be in body already"
[20:31:43] <ZeuZ> now that's different than what I see, wich is rare, but I'm going to check the entire thing out again
[20:31:47] <coldhead> then it sees <head> IN the body and goes "umm... must be a accident"
[20:31:58] <coldhead> then it gets a very stiff brandy
[20:32:02] <tw2113> the page is a boy...it's head is way too south
[20:32:04] <coldhead> and again, who could blame it
[20:32:13] <ZeuZ> ha xD
[20:32:19] <ZeuZ> Ok that was admitedly funny
[20:32:40] <tw2113> of course, i'm hilarious
[20:32:56] <coldhead> can i also just point out at this point that The Mercury Program are one of the very bands to listen to when looking at other people's bugs and i highly endorse them to you
[20:33:07] <coldhead> very best bands* god have mercy on me
[20:33:32] <ZeuZ> Enlighten me, The Mercury Program? :D
[20:34:19] <coldhead> this is what i end up with after logging in http://pastebin.com/QGxyGwLR
[20:34:26] <coldhead> that's the actual html my browser has constructed
[20:34:28] <coldhead> no head
[20:34:30] <ZeuZ> Just changed something, hang on
[20:34:30] <coldhead> no css :(
[20:34:40] <ZeuZ> try it now (force cache flush)
[20:34:49] <coldhead> http://www.myspace.com/themercuryprogram
[20:34:54] <tw2113> much better ZeuZ
[20:35:19] <ZeuZ> tw2113, the problem was indeed where the php snippet was placed
[20:35:33] <ZeuZ> now I have to deal with the "Cerrar Sesion" issue wich should be fairly easy
[20:35:41] <coldhead> let this day go down in history as the day someone on IRC was right about the cause of a bug
[20:35:43] <tw2113> order is important
[20:35:45] <coldhead> good word, tw2113
[20:35:49] <coldhead> work*
[20:35:57] <coldhead> no more typing for me, i'm in no fit state
[20:36:05] <tw2113> drunk?
[20:36:08] <shoky> cold head
[20:36:10] <coldhead> too much monday
[20:36:13] <tw2113> high on meds?
[20:36:19] <coldhead> diabetic coma
[20:36:23] <tw2113> ah
[20:36:23] <shoky> yummy
[20:36:57] <ZeuZ> oh, to think you could be having some Fernet with Coca-Cola right now
[20:37:19] <shoky> hmm coca cola
[20:37:26] <shoky> come hither
[20:37:27] <Whirl3d> Femet?
[20:37:32] <ZeuZ> Fernet
[20:37:40] <ZeuZ> probably not well known outside argentina
[20:37:52] <Whirl3d> ...
[20:38:04] <ZeuZ> Lemme resume it this way: even if you DON'T get drunk, you'll most likely have diarrea
[20:38:13] <shoky> Ha.
[20:38:21] <someprimetime> fernet is this shit that all the hipsters drink in san francisco
[20:38:30] <someprimetime> you're not missing out; it smells like old people
[20:38:37] <ZeuZ> it does
[20:38:39] <ZeuZ> indeed
[20:38:53] <ZeuZ> however it's pretty popular among people from Cordoba
[20:39:00] <ZeuZ> they're ferneteros
[20:39:12] <coldhead> interesting!
[20:39:50] <Whirl3d> Google has a lot of nothing to say about it on page one, lol
[20:39:52] <lsone> ironically enough i noticed my ruby-writin, mac-totin hipster buddy that is on vacation in SF posting a couple pictures on Facebook of him drinking that stuff tonight. lol
[20:40:14] <ZeuZ> 7 degrees link anyone?
[20:42:42] <Whirl3d> Funny, I lived in SF as a young hipster for 15 years and never heard of the shit. Yet SF accounts for 25% of US consumption? Wow
[20:43:07] <lsone> LOL
[20:43:28] <Whirl3d> Course that was back when ecstacy was GOOD.
[20:43:37] <Whirl3d> so we didn't drink much...
[20:43:38] <lsone> its ok, i live in texas and have never actually consumed a Shiner *shrug*
[20:43:44] <lsone> bahaha
[20:43:54] <lsone> who needs beer when you have glow sticks?
[20:43:57] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: that's why the hipsters love it. no one else outside of SF has heard of it
[20:44:00] <someprimetime> it's still "underground"
[20:44:16] <Whirl3d> bah, sf sounds like la to me
[20:44:20] <someprimetime> hell no
[20:44:42] <someprimetime> i was born and raised in northern california (i live in oakland now) and LA and SF are polar opposites
[20:44:54] <someprimetime> although i've been noticing a lot of people from LA up here lately
[20:45:01] * tw2113 will be in that area in about 11 days
[20:45:17] <lsone> kinda hard to troll hipsters in a  web dev majority chatroom . lol
[20:45:18] <someprimetime> is there an event that i don't about going on? or just visiting
[20:45:19] <someprimetime> @tw2113
[20:45:33] <someprimetime> www.hipsterorhomeless.com not hard
[20:45:33] <tw2113> Mozilla invited me out for a Doc Sprint
[20:45:35] <lsone> pretty sure he is just visiting
[20:45:38] <Whirl3d> I could fly to SF round trip from Atlanta for 314.00 right now. I was thinking about flying out there...when is jquerycon?
[20:45:45] <someprimetime> sorry shameless plug to my now defunct satirical hot or not site
[20:45:50] <tw2113> so i'll be there for a long weekend
[20:46:08] <someprimetime> nice it's in july i think
[20:46:13] <someprimetime> july 21 or something
[20:46:20] <someprimetime> i'm gonna get my company to pay for it so i can go
[20:46:33] <someprimetime> i was in georga this past summer helping a buddy out with a website/working on a side project of mine
[20:46:37] <someprimetime> georgia, rather
[20:46:41] <someprimetime> roswell/woodstock
[20:46:53] <Whirl3d> unbelievable hot
[20:46:53] <someprimetime> it sucks that Delta controls that airport basically
[20:47:00] <Whirl3d> not for long
[20:47:29] <someprimetime> tw2113: cool though that they invited you out
[20:48:08] <tw2113> yeah, they paid for the flight and hotel and accomodations
[20:48:15] <tw2113> who could argue
[20:48:15] <someprimetime> legit
[20:48:25] <someprimetime> how'd they find you?
[20:48:48] <tw2113> i helped with a doc sprint remotely back in january
[20:48:53] <Whirl3d> did he say Mozilla, he meant Falcon...and they found him on xtube...really
[20:48:58] <someprimetime> oh nice.
[20:49:02] <someprimetime> haha Whirl3d
[20:49:14] <someprimetime> tw2113: mainly js docs?
[20:49:30] <tw2113> it'll be js/html5/css/modern stuff
[20:49:35] <ZeuZ> Ok now, back to work for me, it's been intresting :P
[20:49:40] <tw2113> documentation, demos, etc
[20:49:58] <Whirl3d> Zeuz, you all squared away?
[20:50:02] <ZeuZ> Well, if you could tell this is work, it's actually me getting to know jQuery :P
[20:50:16] <ZeuZ> Whirl3d, yeah I fixed the glitches on it (graphics at least)
[20:50:33] <ZeuZ> using another host to view source since this one is apparently "stupid"
[20:50:37] <someprimetime> nice
[20:50:48] <ZeuZ> you people were seing something, and I was seing other crap
[20:50:50] <someprimetime> oh wow my cat just dropped a raunchy turd bbl
[20:51:00] <ZeuZ> x'D
[20:51:44] <Whirl3d> Cats...indoors. hell no. x(
[20:51:51] <coldhead> ZeuZ: the problem with invalid html is different browsers try to fix it for you in different ways
[20:53:08] <ZeuZ> coldhead, I'm trying it in Mobile Safari and the Browser included with android
[20:53:13] <ZeuZ> seems to render fine
[20:53:24] <shoky> m m m m m m m mmoooobile
[20:53:27] <ZeuZ> AS OF RIGHT NOW, wait for me to break it again
[20:53:53] <Whirl3d> So nobody knows of any cool projects that facilitate group discussions using jquery? Preferably something graphic with mapping and diagramming?
[20:54:38] <firebalrog> node.js socket.io
[20:54:48] <firebalrog> whirl
[20:55:16] <someprimetime> WHAT THE HELL
[20:55:18] <someprimetime> HE MISSED
[20:55:26] <someprimetime> oh god i put it off for a second while on stackoverflow
[20:55:32] <someprimetime> hold on taking a picture of this disaster
[20:55:34] <shoky> your cat?
[20:55:42] <someprimetime> his turd is sitting outside the litter box
[20:55:43] <someprimetime> one sec
[20:55:54] <ZeuZ> haha
[20:55:57] <shoky> no no ,play by play
[20:56:14] <coldhead> this is much too real
[20:56:15] <Whirl3d> that's how cats do it if you piss em off or forget to clearn their boxes. cats are evil
[20:56:29] <someprimetime> man his thing was clean and i just bought new litter
[20:56:33] <someprimetime> emailed to myself h/o
[20:57:06] <Whirl3d> firebalrog, thanks a lot. This may be just what I wanted.
[20:57:14] <someprimetime> NSFL: http://i.imgur.com/vAqFw.jpg
[20:57:22] <someprimetime> i love the two little ones next to it btw
[20:57:23] <shoky> paHahahahah
[20:57:24] <someprimetime> fucking idiot
[20:57:27] <shoky> nice!!
[20:57:32] <someprimetime> no! not nice!
[20:57:32] <shoky> your cat is lovely
[20:57:34] <someprimetime> bad kitty!
[20:57:45] <shoky> showing you his love
[20:58:13] <Whirl3d> 200 lb man-eating cat based on the size of that turd. The litter box has it's own room?
[20:58:14] <shoky> raunchy love
[20:58:26] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: haha his name is biggie and he weighs almost 20 lbs
[20:58:31] <someprimetime> he probably feels a lot better
[20:58:35] <shoky> pic plz.
[20:58:38] <someprimetime> k one sec
[20:58:39] <shoky> then caption
[20:58:59] <ZeuZ> I literally laughed my ass off with that one
[20:59:12] <coldhead> and i meanwhile wept for us all
[20:59:47] <someprimetime> http://i.imgur.com/RPqK9.jpg the suspect
[21:00:17] <coldhead> now there is a cat who is too big to bother with litter boxes
[21:00:22] <coldhead> and too awesome to give a fuck
[21:00:35] <ZeuZ> haha
[21:01:45] <shoky> <3 biggie
[21:01:46] <mister_m> what does $() mean?
[21:01:51] <ZeuZ> Ok, now goes the question: what's next? him driving your car?
[21:01:56] <mister_m> also: $[x] ?
[21:02:03] <shoky> mister_m it gives you an empty jquery object
[21:02:14] <Whirl3d> His head in a piece of bread like on Southpark?
[21:02:23] <someprimetime> if he drove my car he'd crash it
[21:02:28] <shoky> $[x]  is i guess like referencing $.x
[21:02:35] <ZeuZ> hahaha
[21:02:44] <ZeuZ> ohh, shit tonight was south park: the movie
[21:02:46] <ZeuZ> I missed it again
[21:02:52] <ZeuZ> damn you for making me remember
[21:03:01] <ZeuZ> otherwise I wouldn't have to download it
[21:03:02] <Whirl3d> ZeuZ, download the shit.
[21:03:22] <ZeuZ> it's worth some laughs right? at least so it seamed
[21:03:59] <Whirl3d> It's good--for southpark. It's not family guy, but it's good
[21:04:34] <ZeuZ> bi-bi-bi-bird bird the bird is the word!
[21:04:46] <ZeuZ> that silly tune got stuck in my head for like a week
[21:05:50] <mister_m> shoky: so that just lets me pop in objects into jquery itself?
[21:05:57] <mister_m> what is the significance of that
[21:06:15] <mister_m> so that any of my functions using jquery can use them?
[21:06:49] <Whirl3d> severely off topic, but did you hear that Matt & Trey (the creators of Southpark) went to the academy awards (or something similar) in drag while tripping on acid?
[21:07:32] <ZeuZ> wouldn't surprise me much, seeing what south park is
[21:10:22] <ML74> for 	 jQuery('#navbar li a').click(function(){
[21:10:23] <ML74> how could i add a class to the li?
[21:12:59] <mister_m> shoky: what is $.x? does that let me put whatever I like into $.x assuming it doesn't exist
[21:13:07] <mister_m> and why would i want to do that
[21:13:39] <Whirl3d> mister_m, you need to read about jquery....
[21:14:37] <mister_m> Whirl3d: I'm all ears if you'd care to explain it
[21:15:26] <Whirl3d> You got about 2500 US Dollars and a month, I'd be happy to.
[21:16:09] <mister_m> Whirl3d: you are being deliberately obtuse and not helpful
[21:16:53] <Whirl3d> I, for one, am not here to teach you the basics of jquery. I am here to help you if you get stuck somewhere in the middle.
[21:17:41] <shoky> mister_m what do you want to do ?
[21:17:58] <mister_m> Whirl3d: I'd appreciate it if you didn't feel like making me feel stupid for asking a simple question.
[21:18:11] <shoky> $.x means the x property of $ which is an alias for jQuery
[21:18:23] <mister_m> shoky: I want to know if $.x = ... is inserting something into the jquery object
[21:18:28] <shoky> you can set .x on any object
[21:18:31] <shoky> including $
[21:18:34] <mister_m> ok thank you
[21:18:36] <shoky> np
[21:19:01] <Whirl3d> mister_m, I certainly don't want you to feel stupid. That's why I suggested that youread about jquery. In the first sentence or two, it answers your questions.
[21:19:26] <shoky> more like javascript docs for what he's asking
[21:19:42] <shoky> very basic javascript
[21:19:56] <Whirl3d> I was pointing you in the right direction, not trying to make you feel stupid.
[21:20:02] <mister_m> no I understand the basic prototypal object stuff
[21:20:28] <Whirl3d> Than you should know that $ is another way of saying jquery
[21:20:33] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/VaXLdkM7
[21:20:38] <mister_m> shoky: I am more interested in the usefulness of sticking things into the actual jquery object. This lets everything that has a handle on $ access what I put in it, yes?
[21:20:56] <shoky> what do you mean by the actual jquery object ?
[21:21:02] <shoky> i guess you mean $.fn
[21:21:03] <thomedy> could someone look at that and tell me why in my second document function i  am not getting any behavior at all
[21:21:06] <mister_m> shoky: I suppose $
[21:21:11] <Whirl3d> $ is an alias for jquery
[21:21:17] <thomedy> i copy pasted my class but no click
[21:21:26] <someprimetime> mister_m: $ is just a namespace basically for jquery
[21:21:31] <someprimetime> it's what jquery is mapped to
[21:21:42] <shoky> mister_m, what do you want to do with the things that you stick into the actual jquery object?
[21:22:04] <mister_m> shoky: I am not trying to do anything, I am trying to understand why someone would do that
[21:22:22] <shoky> doing $.x = ...;
[21:22:41] <mister_m> maybe I need a concrete example
[21:22:44] <shoky> is one way of adding/modifying the x property of the $ object
[21:22:57] <mister_m> yes
[21:23:26] <shoky> i'm not sure if it's a recommended way, unless you're developing jquery.. or a plugin maybe i dunno
[21:24:39] <shoky> did you see it done somewhere specific? that'd be a concrete example
[21:24:58] <Whirl3d> http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How_jQuery_Works
[21:26:02] <mister_m> shoky: I am looking at the deck.js source code and they do $[x].thing = {...}
[21:26:09] <mister_m> https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js/blob/master/core/deck.core.js   line 438 for isntance
[21:27:27] <Whirl3d> $(selectors) is a way of saying "select all elements in the dom that meet the critieria in 'selectors'"
[21:27:39] <Whirl3d> so $("div") will select all div elements
[21:28:05] <Whirl3d> Then, you can call jquery methods on the collection of elements you have selected.
[21:28:24] <Whirl3d> Things like change the color attribute to red: $("div").attr("color","red");
[21:29:17] <shoky> mister_m, i think they're indeed just using the $ namespace to store their data
[21:29:43] <shoky> jQuery namespace that is
[21:29:49] <mister_m> I feel like that is bad
[21:29:55] <mister_m> but I don't know
[21:29:56] <Whirl3d> You can cache your collection of elements in a variable like: var divlist=$("div");  then reference those divs you selected by divlist.attr('color','red');
[21:29:57] <shoky> it's probably not great
[21:30:08] <shoky> but not that bad..
[21:30:27] <Whirl3d> It is a naming convention that people argue about to use $variablename to represent a jquery collection
[21:30:37] <Whirl3d> like $divlist=$("div");
[21:30:45] <Whirl3d> the first part is just a variable name$divlist
[21:30:45] <shoky> Whirl3d who are you talking to?
[21:30:45] <someprimetime> yeah i use it for all my dom elements
[21:30:52] <someprimetime> and for numbers and strings i just leave it off
[21:30:53] <Whirl3d> mister_m
[21:31:05] <shoky> i think he understands $()
[21:31:07] <someprimetime> var $container = $('#div'); var sum = 4;
[21:31:09] <tocka> morrning
[21:31:15] <someprimetime> find it easier to read that way
[21:31:29] <shoky> he's asking about $[]
[21:32:05] <Whirl3d> Not according to line 483 of the source code he refernced but okay.
[21:32:17] <shoky> he asked about 438 ;)
[21:32:41] <shoky> 483 is.. blank?
[21:32:49] <mister_m> 438
[21:34:52] <thomedy> okay i just went on to js fiddle and its not working there either
[21:35:14] <shoky> thomedy whuts the prob who what
[21:35:23] <shoky> link exposition etc.
[21:35:26] <thomedy> is it possible to add a click function that  is on a div that is dynamicajquery
[21:35:35] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/kaeA4/1/
[21:35:40] <thomedy> its kind of important
[21:35:44] <shoky> whuts dynamicajquery
[21:36:09] <shoky> wat?
[21:36:47] <thomedy> if you wouldn't mind going to my jsfiddle and check it out
[21:36:55] <thomedy> cuz i didn't think this would be a problem
[21:37:04] <thomedy> but my concept of jquery must be nubile sstill
[21:37:05] <shoky> i am there
[21:37:13] <shoky> i have no idea what your question is
[21:37:24] <thomedy> oh im sorry why cant i click the a that is appended
[21:37:39] <shoky> you can
[21:37:42] <shoky> nothing happens
[21:37:58] <thomedy> diddnt i put an lert that says me or did i just think i did that
[21:38:00] <thomedy> im watching a movie too
[21:38:07] <shoky> alert? no
[21:38:23] <thomedy> its in mine
[21:38:29] <thomedy> let me give you the fiddle again
[21:38:33] <thomedy> thats weird
[21:38:40] <shoky> this is what im looking at http://jsfiddle.net/kaeA4/1/
[21:38:45] <shoky> not much there
[21:38:52] <shoky> everything workin as expected
[21:39:09] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/kaeA4/2/
[21:39:20] <thomedy> maybe i didn't save it so i saved it and thats the second one
[21:39:25] <shoky> ok
[21:39:46] <shoky> you bind the click on $('.a') inside the domready handler
[21:40:09] <shoky> but the div with class 'a' doesnt exist yet at that point
[21:40:13] <shoky> so nothing is binded
[21:40:24] <shoky> then you add the div.
[21:40:30] <shoky> so nothing is binded to it
[21:40:42] <shoky> you need to either bind to the div after its created
[21:40:56] <shoky> or use event delegation
[21:41:11] <shoky> in which case im too tired to explain anything so see ?.on
[21:41:13] <bot-t> shoky, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:41:13] <thomedy> okay i can either google it or you can tell me and im fine with either but hoping for the easier one on how to do that
[21:41:25] <thomedy> i will go to that link thank you
[21:41:29] <thomedy> that should fix me
[21:41:39] <shoky> if you want it to bind to all divs of class 'a'
[21:41:42] <thomedy> thank you
[21:41:45] <shoky> you can do:
[21:42:14] <shoky> $(document).on('click', '.a', function() { alert('me'); } );
[21:42:28] <shoky> lets see if i got it right. im fallig asleep
[21:42:43] <shoky> yes: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/kaeA4/3/
[21:43:22] <thomedy> now that iyou got it
[21:43:24] <thomedy> i did it to
[21:43:24] <shoky> it's best to replace 'document' with some container element that wont be destroyed/replaced dynamically
[21:43:38] <thomedy> i see that i still have much to learn said the padowan
[21:43:54] <shoky> ha
[21:44:14] <thomedy> im so used to doing the same thing over and over again but now i realize im slightly retarded and theres alot of dom out ther
[21:44:43] <shoky> just read the jquery api docs
[21:44:47] <shoky> like.. alphabetically :D
[21:44:53] <shoky> you'll find tons of useful shit
[21:46:26] <thomedy> ive been spending the last few weeks teaching myself php so i havent looked at jquery in a bit
[21:46:54] <thomedy> i saw someone talking about namespaces earlier is js oop
[21:47:05] <thomedy> it doesn't seem like jquery could be
[21:47:08] <thomedy> but like i said
[21:47:19] <thomedy> i have a limited sphere of knowledge
[21:47:38] <shoky> dont we all
[21:51:40] <thomedy> okay aparrently im using  jquery from 1.6 or so because ther e is no .on in mine
[21:52:50] <shoky> <dead
[21:52:50] <shoky> gnight
[21:54:00] <thomedy> i get that 2 jobs. 2 kids 2 bus thank you
[22:14:38] <tocka> Hey guys, maybe anyone came across a good parallax slider wich would have next prev links and pagination (active/inactive) ?
[22:15:36] <dr0id> did you actually try googling, or ...
[22:16:00] <dr0id> googling is unpro, amirite?
[22:16:56] <tocka> dr0id i did :)
[22:17:03] <tocka> i wouldnt be asking here if i didint
[22:17:22] <dr0id> http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/ParallaxSlider/ isn't cool ?
[22:18:51] <centred> how to attr the attribute after process some block ?
[22:19:27] <centred> i am use cloud zoom plugin, after the process the href is change value. can i disable it.
[22:21:01] <tocka> dr0id the thing is its horizontal
[22:21:07] <tocka> im going for a vertical 1 ;/
[22:21:29] <coldhead> alert('Please turn your screen 90 degrees now") ?
[22:25:07] <lyrae> Can someone help me figure out which plug in it's being used in the home menu? I looked at the source but can't figure out http://elegantthemes.com/preview/Gleam/
[22:25:32] <lyrae> i know it's not mousewheel...not jscrollpane..not easing....not address..
[22:27:12] <centred> can someone help to answer it ?
[22:28:22] <coldhead> it's probably all this stuff, lyrae http://elegantthemes.com/preview/Gleam/wp-content/themes/Gleam/js/custom.js?ver=1.0
[22:28:29] <dr0id> tocka: do what coldhead said
[22:28:31] <unCork> centred: try refrace that question
[22:28:46] <lyrae> coldhead: so not a plugin, just custom coded?
[22:29:01] <coldhead> i think so
[22:29:07] <lyrae> oy
[22:29:24] <lyrae> i like how they dont comment
[22:29:46] <coldhead> job security
[22:29:52] <lyrae> indeed
[22:30:23] <coldhead> its really a pretty annoying effect
[22:30:27] <unCork> lyrae: if your looking for the menu animation, its farly simple
[22:30:43] <coldhead> its going to hurt blind people who use screen readers
[22:30:50] <coldhead> or people with poor motor skills
[22:31:09] <lyrae> that i know
[22:31:30] <lyrae> you would just animate the div/span out the screen
[22:31:30] <coldhead> also anyone using the site for more than 30 seconds
[22:31:38] <lyrae> lol
[22:31:45] <centred> ok. i am use this plugin for my client, http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm.
[22:32:08] <centred> its fine, but i want to disable/attr href after thumb clicked/or image change
[22:33:00] <coldhead> is it for a client, lyrae?
[22:33:13] <lyrae> coldhead: no. personal
[22:33:52] <Cork> centred: what link are you talking about?
[22:34:00] <Cork> the one to change the image?
[22:34:16] <centred> yup
[22:34:18] <coldhead> then it's you we need to talk out of it, lyrae
[22:34:23] <centred> but there have <a attribute
[22:34:51] <centred> i want delete the href of <a> tag before and after image changed
[22:35:54] <lyrae> coldhead: =( i know it's annoying for us. but it wows the average user though
[22:36:06] <lyrae> maybe ill just have the fade in instead
[22:36:12] <Cork> centred: and how is the zoomer connected to the links?
[22:36:24] <Cork> (or is it at all?)
[22:36:29] <coldhead> of course, lyrae, it is ultimately a matter for yourself
[22:36:47] <lyrae> coldhead: but i eventually plan on including it in my portfolio
[22:36:53] <centred> i mean <a> tag on big one.
[22:37:05] <lyrae> so the goal is to kinda "wow" the not so web savvy potential employer
[22:37:10] <centred> no problem. i am usually disable the zoom. i am just need to change image effect from there
[22:37:56] <Cork> centred: isn't that the plugins demo page?
[22:38:12] <centred> mean ?
[22:38:32] <centred> scroll to bottom
[22:38:38] <centred> have some demo
[22:38:49] <centred> if you click the small image, will change big image
[22:39:00] * Cork doesn't follow at all...
[22:40:39] <coldhead> what is your native language, centred ?
[22:41:39] <centred> i am indonesian
[22:42:34] <coldhead> tidak ada orang di sini berbicara bahasa indonesia?
[22:42:51] <coldhead> tolong bantu, oh yesus
[22:43:56] <coldhead> i was trying to help
[22:43:59] <coldhead> what a racist jerk
[22:44:11] <coldhead> if i had ops i would ban that fool
[22:57:58] <ansdev1> hi, i'm animating a css top value and IE quirks isn't working... how to solve?
[22:58:05] <ansdev1> oh btw the element is absolute
[23:03:27] <coldhead> do you have a demo, ansdev1 ? hard to debug in our imaginations
[23:06:37] <DEADB33F> Easy to make my own, but is there a built in function which does the opposite of $.param and parses a querystring into an object?
[23:08:41] <coldhead> i don't know of one, DEADB33F
[23:08:47] <coldhead> Eviltwin? Cork?
[23:12:11] <Whirl3d> ben allman's deparam plugin?
[23:13:33] <coldhead> that's the spirit, Whirl3d
[23:13:45] <Whirl3d> lol
[23:13:51] <coldhead> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/
[23:15:05] <DEADB33F> Thx coldhead, I think I'll just write a simple one of my own.
[23:15:14] <DEADB33F> It's only like two lines of code.
[23:15:35] <DEADB33F> I just thought I'd check if there wasn't somethingt already baken in I could use.
[23:15:39] <coldhead> i agree with your intuition that jQuery should do it for you :)
[23:15:42] <DEADB33F> baked
[23:17:52] <Cork> coldhead, DEADB33F: no there isn't a function for that, and its cause normally you don't need to parse param strings
[23:18:21] <coldhead> how dare you tell me what i normally need
[23:18:27] <coldhead> maybe that's ALL I DO with jquery
[23:18:30] <Cork> :)
[23:18:55] <Cork> cause params is meant to be used to send data TO the server, and then you output what you want the script to know in the response
[23:19:05] <coldhead> ya i feel ya
[23:19:34] <ansdev1> coldhead, one second i'll make one
[23:21:24] <coldhead> ansdev1: i won
[23:21:30] <coldhead> ansdev1: i won't check it
[23:21:34] <coldhead> because i am IE free today
[23:21:35] <ansdev1> huh?
[23:21:37] <coldhead> but someone will!
[23:21:41] <ansdev1> cool
[23:21:41] <coldhead> so make it anyway
[23:24:43] <LukeNukem> hello
[23:25:59] <coldhead> hi babe
[23:29:42] <methoddk> anyone know why a radio button would refresh a page instead of a toggle? I'm using twitter bootstraps radio buttons
[23:30:20] <coldhead> sounds like javascript is doing it
[23:30:59] <tocka> Could some one tell me why is this not working?
[23:30:59] <tocka> http://jsbin.com/abevuj/14/edit#javascript,html
[23:32:46] <Cork> tocka: cause you can't click your a links
[23:32:53] <Cork> they'r 0px width
[23:33:04] <Cork> *wide
[23:33:18] <Cork> tocka: either check for the li, or span, or move the span
[23:33:47] <methoddk> coldhead: gotta be because it inside of a form then
[23:34:01] <ansdev1> coldhead: i'm not allowed to show it to the public actually... but i fixed it
[23:34:17] <tocka> Cork you are supposed to click on a circle
[23:34:22] * ansdev1 shouts '*** YOU QUIRKS MODE'
[23:34:29] <tocka> in the design <span> is hidden and the circles
[23:34:30] <tocka> are the links
[23:34:48] <Cork> then you need to prevent the default action on the link
[23:35:09] <Cork> function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }
[23:35:24] <coldhead> good work, ansdev1
[23:35:37] <tocka> but how is this going to help?
[23:35:59] <Cork> tocka: as the page is reloaded, your changes is thrown away
[23:36:02] <aidan> TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'mouseenter' ... where has mouseenter gone?
[23:36:52] <systemfault> aidan: You're probably trying to call a jquery method on a non-jquery object..
[23:37:04] <tocka> Cork but the page isnt reloading, im using a parallax slider
[23:37:13] <tocka> im doing this thing just to show which circle is active
[23:38:53] <Cork> tocka: oh, an your id's in the html is wrong
[23:39:03] <Cork> your id's are ex. ##home
[23:39:12] <Cork> don't have # in the id="" tag
[23:39:45] <tocka> LOL
[23:39:52] <tocka> :D
[23:40:22] <Cork> tocka: btw you should prob try using classes instead for script like that
[23:40:23] <tocka> Cork, thanks, stupid mistake :]
[23:40:35] <tocka> Im not that advanced in jQuery..
[23:41:00] <Cork> tocka: $('#nav a') instead of the selector your using
[23:42:47] <pillar> hi
[23:43:00] <pillar> i have a question about using jquery
[23:43:19] <pillar> I wanna change a position of element
[23:43:43] <pillar> so i use this code, '$(elem).css("left", 100)';
[23:44:29] <pillar> when this code is excuted, the element's style will change to 'style="left:100px;"'
[23:44:40] <pillar> then... I wanna remove this style;
[23:44:44] <pillar> how can i do that?
[23:45:00] <pillar> is there anybody know this problem?
[23:45:01] <Cork> css('left', '')
[23:45:12] <Cork> btw don't forget the unit
[23:45:17] <Cork>  + 'px'
[23:45:22] <methoddk> i tried adding return false; on click for the radio buttons, they still cause a page refresh
[23:46:06] <Cork> methoddk: radio buttons doens't cause refreshes
[23:46:13] <pillar> oh thank you..
[23:46:22] <systemfault> mechler: Are these really radio buttons?
[23:46:24] <methoddk> I'm trying to use them in a form Cork
[23:46:24] <pillar> but.. must do i append 'px'??
[23:46:33] <pillar> just int type param isnt ok?
[23:46:37] <Cork> pillar: to the first one yes
[23:46:40] <systemfault> Err sorry mechler  :(
[23:46:48] <Cork> css('left', 100 + 'px')
[23:46:57] <systemfault> methoddk: Are these really radio buttons? In the markup
[23:47:10] <methoddk> they are bootstrap radio buttons
[23:47:23] <systemfault> methoddk: I don't care.. what is the html tag?
[23:47:40] <methoddk> <button onclick="return false;" class="btn">Inventory</button>
[23:47:47] <methoddk> is how it looks
[23:47:58] <systemfault> methoddk: If they're <button>s, clicking on them submit the form
[23:48:08] <systemfault> Unless… you add type="button"
[23:48:23] <methoddk> i want to stop that, shouldn't return false do that
[23:49:13] <systemfault> Just add    type="button" ?
[23:49:41] <methoddk> systemfault that worked, thanks
[23:49:52] <systemfault> You're welcome.
[23:50:26] <thomedy> okay so i should be using 1.6 jquery but delegate/live both are not working firebug is saying the function is not real
[23:51:19] <systemfault> thomedy:  Okay….
[23:51:25] <Cork> thomedy: what does $.fn.jQuery say?
[23:51:41] <iman> I added JQuery library to web page but in eclipse IDE I can't use content assist as autocompletion, what do you think is wrong with me ?
[23:52:51] <thomedy> Cork what is $.fn.jQuery
[23:52:53] <systemfault> iman: Nothing's wrong with you…. All IDEs except those from jetbrains suck at javascript.. :(
[23:53:17] <Cork> thomedy: it should include the version of jquery you have loaded on the page
[23:53:22] <Cork> its a simple variable
[23:53:28] <thomedy> cool
[23:53:53] <coldhead> it's $.fn.jquery though, i think
[23:53:55] <coldhead> all lower case
[23:54:01] <coldhead> ?eval $.fn.jquery
[23:54:04] <bot-t> coldhead: "1.4.2"
[23:54:10] <coldhead> ?eval $.fn.jQuery
[23:54:10] <bot-t> coldhead: undefined
[23:54:13] <iman> systemfault: there isn't any other way to solve that ?
[23:54:22] <Cork> ah... its ui that upercase :/
[23:54:29] <Cork> i always mix them up...
[23:54:36] <coldhead> good old consistency
[23:54:38] <systemfault> iman: jquery is like… a handful of functions, just learn them
[23:54:58] <iman> thanks
[23:55:13] <LukeNukem> Hi i need to recognize click of a button in a user script
[23:55:19] <LukeNukem> its a bit confusing can someone help me out
[23:55:50] <Cork> LukeNukem: just select the button and bind .click on it
[23:56:20] <flaccid> with an ajax jsonp i'm getting Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/plain: in return so its not a success though the http request was. trying to work out how to tell it that its jsonp and text/plain
[23:56:50] <flaccid> i'll organise a pastebin
[23:57:07] <systemfault> flaccid: Why it's not success?
[23:57:12] <Cork> flaccid: the server should return application/javascript or text/javascript
[23:57:13] <LukeNukem> Cork, on user scripts it does not work like that, i have a function which includes jquery.js
[23:57:26] <systemfault> flaccid: jsonp is javascript.
[23:57:29] <flaccid> i assume because the error it hits
[23:57:31] <LukeNukem> and then i create a function and call it jqueryinitfunction(childfunction)
