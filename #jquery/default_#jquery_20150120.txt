[00:48:35] <Ayub_> I am using jquery template to render it..however I see this error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '_ctnt' of undefined
[00:49:27] <Ayub_> I am rendering table using jquery template..not sure why I get the above error only for some array of data..not for all
[00:49:41] <Cork> ?paste @ Ayub_
[00:49:41] <b-ot> Ayub_: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:49:50] <Ayub_> ok..
[00:59:24] <Ayub_> Cork: please look at this paste http://jsfiddle.net/3gfga8wt/
[01:06:26] <mariusz> Can someone smarter than me explain to me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/6ch1aczp/
[01:13:03] <Cork> Ayub_: could you include the template plugin
[01:13:20] <Cork> or rather include what is needed to reproduce the message
[01:14:08] <Cork> mariusz: what do you mean it works exactly as you want it to
[01:14:13] <Ayub_> Cork: just clueless as the data is an array of objects which is passed to the template
[01:14:21] <Cork> or at least exactly as the code says it should
[01:15:20] <Cork> mariusz: guessing a bit from the pb, but in the change event you revert the checkbox to what it was before the element was changed
[01:15:32] <Cork> meaning as it is unchecked on page load you force it to stay unchecked
[01:16:00] <Cork> mariusz: remove line 7 and the toggling works
[01:19:00] <davidw> I'm trying to put  together a little example file, and would be happy if I could get it running both on a server (easy) and as a file:///....  the tricky part: loading up some data
[01:19:23] <davidw> does jquery provide any kind of wrapper that I might find useful? I haven't found anything googling
[01:22:20] <Cork> davidw: don't run on file://
[01:22:27] <Cork> it is a world of pain
[01:22:32] <Cork> use a small webserver instead
[01:22:38] <Cork> there are plenty of them out there
[01:23:22] <Cork> you want the development environment to be as close to "live" as possible, and file:// is very far from how a web request works
[01:25:10] <davidw> Cork, yes, that's true... it's more about "download this, see what the results are".  I want to use it with http://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/ - which is a pretty neat little bit of code
[01:25:49] <Cork> davidw: ya, the problem is file doesn't support absolute urls, it has relative path restrictions
[01:25:54] <Cork> and headers doesn't exist
[01:26:19] <Cork> so if it works there means basically nothing for when you run on a web server
[01:26:25] <davidw> I suppose the easiest thing would be     <script src="something.js"></script> with the data just dumped in there
[01:26:31] <Cork> that is why i strongly recommend not doing this
[01:26:41] <davidw> Cork, yeah, I guess they're too far apart to have something that spans both ways of doing things
[01:26:50] <Cork> ya
[01:27:10] <Cork> well i go as far as to say you should avoice file:// as the plague
[01:27:21] <Cork> except for privilaged code (it uses it in some environments)
[01:27:41] <davidw> Cork, this is not really an end-user project, it's just a simple demo file
[01:27:58] <Cork> davidw: doesn't really matter, comment still stands
[01:28:44] <Cork> setting up nginx in linux is like a < 1 minute job (apache is just slightly longer)
[01:29:05] <Cork> and windows has super tiny web server that you can just start to have a test env
[01:29:21] <Cork> that is much better solutions then running from file://
[01:32:00] <davidw> I wonder if I can just generate the SVG directly....
[01:54:37] <Erwat> Cork: i usually go with node
[01:54:48] <Erwat> npm install http-server -g
[01:54:58] <Cork> Erwat: i'm not a fan of running js as a server
[01:55:14] <Erwat> Cork: sorry i meant npm
[01:55:34] <Erwat> you can just pull http-server and then do
[01:55:50] <Erwat> http-server [path] [options]
[01:56:16] <Erwat> and note when i say pull i mean the generic "acquire"
[01:56:23] <Erwat> not a programming term
[01:58:23] <Cork> Erwat: i know node, i just don't like running it as a webserver
[01:59:07] <Erwat> i don't know it, so i say wrong things about it all the time
[02:02:51] <gtristan> with very limited experience in 'web', it seems to me a ridiculous choice to run a scripted language that is inherently memory intensive, as a web service, but I have no idea how it is supposed to run (maybe nodejs scripts are run by apache and it's not a nodejs process with an expected uptime ?)
[02:03:56] <Cork> gtristan: scripting languages server side is far from uncommon (php, ruby, python, perl, asp, aspx...)
[02:04:09] <Cork> gtristan: that isn't the problem
[02:04:11] <gtristan> Cork, yes but those are generally not web servers
[02:04:20] <gtristan> Cork, apache runs them in response to requests
[02:04:27] <gtristan> right ? maybe ruby is a web server
[02:04:33] <Cork> the problem is that js isn't meant for server work, it isn't expressed in a way optimized for that type of task
[02:04:54] <Cork> gtristan: ruby is normally ran as a full server ya
[02:05:14] <Cork> gtristan: php is often ran as a server that webserver forwards to
[02:05:25] <Cork> python is also normally a full webserver
[02:05:40] <gtristan> django yeah, that looked attractive actually
[02:05:44] <Cork> so ya, doesn't really fit
[02:06:20] <Cork> gtristan: my problem with it is the same as the thought of running php client side
[02:06:27] <Cork> (and yes there is ppl who does this)
[02:06:35] <gtristan> haha
[02:06:41] <Cork> or ruby for that matter
[02:06:41] <Uhkis> wait what
[02:06:53] <Uhkis> php client side?
[02:06:59] <Cork> Uhkis: there is enterpreter written in js
[02:07:07] <Cork> and there is enscripten
[02:07:10] <Uhkis> -.-
[02:07:12] <gtristan> well, I could imagine php can be useful outside of web backends, as perl is, for processing/parsing and formatting text
[02:07:14] <Cork> *emscripten
[02:07:24] <Cork> Uhkis: i didn't mean it was good :)
[02:07:38] <Cork> gtristan: you're missing the point
[02:07:52] <Cork> gtristan: these languages is very inefficient client side
[02:07:55] <gtristan> not that it could be useful in the browser, yes I get the point, it's not a good tool for a web frontend indeed
[02:08:07] <Cork> cause they wheren't built for using there
[02:08:18] <Cork> actually i put java in the same bucket
[02:08:24] <Cork> (and activex)
[02:08:55] <Uhkis> i actually once made a simple file manager in php (using php-gtk)
[02:09:10] <gtristan> my skepticism about node-as-a-server is more that I wouldnt want a long running trusted process running something fragile and memory hungry like JS
[02:09:50] <Cork> gtristan: js isn't fragile or espectially memory hungry
[02:09:59] <gtristan> on the other hand the node crowd are proving the usefulness of JS outside of the browser (not necessarily proving JS as a good choice for a server)
[02:10:24] <Cork> gtristan: and node wasn't the first to adopt js outside the browser ;)
[02:10:28] <Cork> far from it
[02:10:47] <Cork> heck mongodb is more impressive in this area if you ask me
[02:10:51] <gtristan> it can be very difficult to GC JS well, due to it's extremely dynamic nature - very hard to tell when a scope can safely go away
[02:10:54] <Cork> its entire api is js based
[02:11:32] <Cork> gtristan: not really, as long as you make sure you don't keep references where you shouldn't it isn't a big problem
[02:11:41] <gtristan> but perhaps they are getting there, I know that gjs (used in gnome-shell) has harder problems to solve than python bindings and the like
[02:11:47] <Cork> but ya gc is tricky, but that isn't a js only problem
[02:12:21] <gtristan> well, JS makes it harder than simple lisp at least
[02:12:36] <Cork> gtristan: lisp isn't a gc language
[02:13:08] <Cork> gtristan: you have similar problems if you go with golang or .net or aspx or ruby or python
[02:13:13] <Cork> they are all gc managed
[02:13:18] <Cork> well python is optional
[02:13:48] <Cork> and gc makes performance tricky, its inherent with gc
[02:14:44] <gtristan> yeah, I've found that when dealing with GC languages, we go back about 30 years and start writing code which allocates everything at startup
[02:14:51] <gtristan> to ensure the GC never runs
[02:15:11] <gtristan> guess we're growing out of the days when ram was expensive and dynamic allocations important ;-)
[02:15:54] <gtristan> (was my brief experience with AS3, which I did find to be elegant, if not annoyingly underperformant)
[02:18:38] <Omar-> good morning
[02:21:11] <davidw> Cork, what do you mean Lisp isn't GC?
[02:24:19] <eNTi> hi. i'm having trouble with a jquery library (magnific popup). the library is not being loaded and i don't know why. is there a way to debug this? i've checked the file name lots of times but it just seems as if it couldn't be found? is there a way to tell in visual studio and/or browser if the library path is incorrect or something?
[02:24:36] <gtristan> wikipedia: "Lisp is especially notable as both the first functional programming language and the first language to introduce garbage collection."
[02:25:16] <gtristan> davidw, I think its just that its basically a very simple ref counted thing, not mark and sweep and GC invocations and such
[02:25:34] <davidw> gtristan, actually, they were doing sophisticated GC with Lisp a long time ago:
[02:25:35] <gtristan> I would imagine it to be like working with ObjC with ARC
[02:25:47] <davidw> http://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Lieberary/GC/Realtime/Realtime.html
[02:25:53] <davidw> this paper is from 1983
[02:26:08] <gtristan> thats when all the good papers came out ;-)
[02:26:09] <gtristan> hehe
[02:26:42] <mariusz> ok i'm stupid, agreed.
[02:26:53] <mariusz> now i put it in a modal and it doesn't work anymore
[02:27:02] <Uhkis> Cork: do you happen to have that nice recursive json parser anywhere saved? (from yesterday iirc)
[02:27:07] <mariusz> guess the modal stops event propagation or something?
[02:27:34] <Cork> Uhkis: no i typed that up on the fly :)
[02:27:49] <Cork> Uhkis: check the irc log (topic)
[02:28:00] <Uhkis> right!
[02:29:11] <Uhkis> if only firefox search supported regex :D
[02:30:15] <Cork> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/eskobaba/qzh41pha/12/
[02:31:11] <Uhkis> thanks
[02:33:45] <Cork> just searched for Cork: http:/ :)
[02:33:50] <Erwat> why can't i just think really hard and the computer then does things for me?
[02:34:07] <Cork> Erwat: you're missing the mind reading implant
[02:34:21] <Cork> go to your local bio-upgrade store!
[02:35:53] <Uhkis> :D
[02:37:01] <Erwat> hey unrelated question: how much does it cost to get an ID where you guys live? eg if your id has expired. same question for passport
[02:37:10] <Erwat> you can estimate, don't have to look up exact values
[02:38:11] <Cork> Erwat: it used to be like $18 (converted todays currency)
[02:38:27] <Cork> but i haven't needed one for many many years so not sure what it is today
[02:38:53] <Erwat> id + passport here is literally 50 euros
[02:39:05] <Cork> jikes its gone up a lot
[02:39:17] <Cork> its 49$ now >_>
[02:39:24] <Cork> poor kids
[02:39:40] <Uhkis> 45e here for passport
[02:39:47] <Erwat> and they last 5 years here
[02:39:58] <Erwat> 50 euros is 13% of a monthly minimum wage
[02:40:02] <Uhkis> 55e for id
[02:40:21] <Cork> ya, passport is about the same here
[02:40:46] <Erwat> i don't have a single id that isn't expired currently
[02:41:19] <Cork> Erwat: get a drivers license
[02:41:22] <Cork> :)
[02:41:32] <Uhkis> yeah, these things last forever
[02:41:46] <Erwat> Cork: i don't know how to drive
[02:41:48] <Cork> ya, i think they've lowered it to *just* 15 years now
[02:41:57] <Erwat> and getting a drivers license with an exam and all that
[02:41:59] <Uhkis> mine expires 2055
[02:42:00] <Erwat> will cost me a good 500 euros
[02:42:01] <Cork> it used to be like 20
[02:42:04] <Uhkis> no hurry to renew :D
[02:42:17] <Erwat> if not even more
[02:42:37] <Uhkis> Erwat: wow, that's really cheap
[02:43:24] <Erwat> Uhkis: is it?
[02:43:28] <Uhkis> Erwat: ~2000e here
[02:43:39] <Erwat> yes but your average income is like 3200 euros
[02:43:45] <Erwat> or something like that
[02:43:48] <Erwat> here it's like 750
[02:44:14] <Uhkis> average might be that, reality is ~2200e
[02:44:23] <Cork> ya, a drivers license easily breaks 1500€ here
[02:44:30] <Erwat> my last full paycheck on a full time job would not get me a drivers license
[02:44:49] <davidw> jeez - where is that?!
[02:44:59] <Erwat> estonia
[02:45:17] <Uhkis> no worries, neither does mine
[02:45:33] <Uhkis> damn you taxes!
[02:46:05] <Cork> heh Uhkis you wouldn't want to know the tax level here :)
[02:46:30] <Erwat> it's only ~40% here
[02:46:32] <Erwat> plus VAT
[02:46:38] <Erwat> which is ~20%
[02:46:54] <Erwat> so people are taxed around ~50%
[02:47:15] <Cork> Erwat: if you buy an item for 100 you pay 67.5 in tax
[02:47:26] <Cork> and i'm on the low end of taxing
[02:48:01] <Erwat> wait you mean VAT is like 200%?
[02:48:14] <Cork> my mom pays 108.75 in tax for every 100 she buys
[02:48:20] <Uhkis> ?!?!
[02:48:26] <Erwat> Cork: what do you mean with buys?
[02:48:29] <Erwat> you mean VAT?
[02:48:33] <davidw> uhm.... where is that?
[02:48:37] <Erwat> norway
[02:48:38] <Erwat> most likely
[02:48:40] <Cork> Erwat: you go to the stor and buy something
[02:48:50] <Cork> what you actually pay is 100 + the taxes
[02:48:59] <Erwat> so you pay 208.75?
[02:49:03] <Cork> yes
[02:49:16] <Cork> incomtax is 67% for her
[02:49:16] <Erwat> where 108.75 is purely taxes? and this is on all kinds of stuff?
[02:49:24] <Erwat> oh you mean income tax and all that included
[02:49:25] <Cork> and then 25% vat on that (double taxing ftw)
[02:49:25] <Erwat> phew
[02:49:33] <davidw> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_of_Europe VAT rate in NOrway is 25%
[02:49:50] <Erwat> Cork: so she's taxed at around 75%
[02:49:56] <Cork> ya
[02:50:03] <Erwat> in estonia it's at about 50%
[02:50:12] <Erwat> but the thing is
[02:50:14] <Cork> but that is if you buy a normal goods
[02:50:19] <Erwat> it ranges from like 47% to 53%
[02:50:27] <Erwat> this means the poorest will pay 47% in taxes and the richest 53%
[02:50:32] <Cork> you wouldn't want to know the tax on gasoline :)
[02:50:36] <mooncup> 11:49 < Cork> and then 25% vat on that (double taxing ftw)
[02:50:39] <Cork> vat is 60%   :D
[02:50:48] <Erwat> Cork: they call that excise i think?
[02:50:49] <mooncup> better than america where they have no tax but everyone has to fend for themselves imo
[02:50:52] <Erwat> but yeah that's this way here too
[02:51:04] <mooncup> what country are you in with 60% vat tho?
[02:51:11] <Cork> mooncup: sweden
[02:51:31] <Cork> mooncup: 60% is only on gasoline though
[02:51:49] <Erwat> mooncup: what he means is that there's high excise on it
[02:51:55] <Erwat> but yeah that's standard in european countries
[02:52:01] <mooncup> ah yeah we have pretty insane fuel tax here too
[02:52:04] <Cork> well an diesel
[02:52:06] <mooncup> but it's a good thing imo
[02:52:09] <Erwat> alcohol and tobacco is the same
[02:52:17] <Cork> ya, same here
[02:52:36] <Cork> though the eu import things changed that quite drastically
[02:52:45] <davidw> fuel has negative externalities
[02:53:10] <Erwat> davidw: why are we taxing the consumption of it rather than production then?
[02:53:15] <Uhkis> iirc we have 85% of taxes on gas prices here
[02:53:18] <Cork> davidw: the tax here is for environmental reasons not where it comes from
[02:53:45] <Cork> we actually have negatic vat on ethanol
[02:53:59] <mooncup> subsidy?
[02:54:02] <Cork> ya
[02:54:22] <Cork> they are talking about removing that though
[02:54:28] <Cork> and push for electric instead
[02:54:47] <hrolf> Hi #jquerymobile
[02:55:01] <hrolf> I'm having issues with zoom in/out and swiping (in phonegap iOS.)
[02:55:03] <hrolf> When I zoom in/out of my page, the page swipe (to the left and right depending on the gesture.)
[02:55:07] <hrolf> How I do stop this?
[02:55:53] <hrolf> I think it is confusing zoom in/out with swipe.
[02:57:33] <Duikb00t> http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/1vbo Suggestions why this is not working? :s
[02:57:41] <Duikb00t> The ID is the ID of the submit button.
[02:57:53] <Duikb00t> I already tried the one from the <form id>
[02:58:15] <Cork> Duikb00t: .submit is for the form not the button
[02:58:25] <Cork> you shouldn't bind form actions to the button
[02:58:37] <Duikb00t> Well, I tried the form ID as well.
[02:59:14] <Cork> does the form exist when you do the binding?
[02:59:19] <Duikb00t> Yes.
[02:59:55] <Cork> does the id exist more then once?
[03:00:30] <Duikb00t> Checked it: Only once.
[03:01:03] <Cork> ('[id="id-goes-here"]').length is a good way of testing that
[03:02:37] <Duikb00t> like:
[03:02:46] <Duikb00t> console.log($('[id="id-goes-here"]').length());
[03:02:56] <Cork> no () at the end
[03:03:03] <Cork> .length isn't a function
[03:03:43] <Duikb00t> without the () I mean
[03:03:47] <Duikb00t> Yes indeed
[03:04:52] <Duikb00t> It says 0
[03:05:03] <Duikb00t> The form is generated on the fly in the page.
[03:07:46] <Cork> Duikb00t: and where are you trying to do the selection?
[03:07:49] <Cork> on page load?
[03:07:53] <Duikb00t> Yes
[03:08:07] <Cork> ok, so you have to delegate the event handler as the form doesn't exist yet
[03:08:13] <Cork> ?api delegate
[03:08:13] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:08:32] <Duikb00t> Oh that is nice
[03:11:51] <Duikb00t> Thanks a lot Cork
[03:11:54] <Duikb00t> Working like charm.
[03:12:12] <Cork> Duikb00t: note the comment about .on in that page
[03:12:50] <Erwat> wait so if you add %00 at the end of a url in chrome
[03:12:58] <Erwat> it will not be able to understand that it's dealing with a url?
[03:13:23] <Cork> Erwat: it's prob cause of the fancy "is this a search" sniffing all modern browsers seams to love to do
[03:13:33] <Duikb00t> It's about a null bytes injection.
[03:13:36] <Cork> (its the first thing i turn off in a browser)
[03:13:39] <Erwat> well firefox just told me that the content can't be found on the server which is okay
[03:13:48] <Erwat> but IE says "windows cannot find blah"
[03:13:51] <Erwat> and chrome just googles it
[03:14:14] <Cork> Erwat: chrome always google things it doesn't know what it is
[03:14:22] <Cork> perfect way to leak password!
[03:14:25] <Erwat> yeah but it has a fully functioning url in there
[03:14:43] <Erwat> even states the protocol and all
[03:14:55] <Cork> Erwat: ya except it doesn't match the %00 so it doesn't sees it as one
[03:18:53] <Erwat> important milestone on the project coming up this friday
[03:19:03] <Erwat> as in that's the time where i'll know whether the project continues or falls through
[03:19:40] <Erwat> it's the perfect time to work really really hard
[03:42:19] <pusti> is it possible to get all classes of jquery selected objects or do I have to loop through
[03:42:56] <Cork> pusti: you mean an array of the class attribute?
[03:42:57] <Cork> or what?
[03:43:06] <pusti> yeah
[03:43:15] <pusti> yes
[03:43:28] <Cork> $.map($('selector', function(elm) { return elm.class; })
[03:43:36] <Cork> opps
[03:43:39] <Cork> $.map($('selector', function(elm) { return elm.className; })
[03:43:51] <pusti> tnx
[04:14:01] <esko> Offtopic: anyone using Select2 ?
[04:18:16] <Uhkis> i prefer chosen
[04:46:50] <mariusz> anyone got any idea why $('#checkbox').prop('checked') returns false no matter if a checkbox is checked or not?
[04:47:26] <mariusz> i mean â€” generally it doesn't, but it does for me now and I don't know why
[04:47:30] <mariusz> can't find the reason
[04:52:39] <Uhkis> multiple id's?
[04:53:43] <xenaxon> Anybody know ho to make CSS3 Hexagons with images inside them?
[04:55:09] <Ayub_> how to check if jquery is already been defined in the page ?
[04:55:41] <Ayub_> I am trying to check if jquery is loaded the parent page ? then dont explicitly load it
[04:56:19] <krambiorix> hi, i have an inline css (<style>.mydiv{ height:20px;}</style>) in my page. How can i change the height for .mydiv?
[04:56:26] <Omar-> Ayub_ console.log(typeof $);
[04:56:43] <Omar-> if function then jquery is defined, if it returns "undefined" then jquery isn't loaded
[04:56:59] <Omar-> "function" means jQuery is loaded
[04:56:59] <Ayub_> ok..
[04:58:35] <Ayub_> Omar: can I use snippet defined here https://gist.github.com/benbalter/902090
[05:02:26] <Omar-> Ayub_ I really dont know. never used it.
[05:02:30] <Omar-> try it ;)
[05:02:40] <Ayub_> Omar: okay
[05:11:16] <krambiorix> on an element css puts height : 100px  but i want to remove the height. How can i do that?
[05:11:49] <Cork> krambiorix: .css('height', '')
[05:12:01] <krambiorix> Cork, it doesn't override the css :s
[05:12:15] <Cork> krambiorix: you mean override the css from the stylesheats?
[05:12:21] <Cork> you would have to set a value then
[05:12:48] <Cork> or even batter have the height be a class and just remove the class from the element
[05:12:51] <krambiorix> Cork, but i want the div to stretch by its content
[05:13:06] <krambiorix> Cork, smart!!!
[05:13:06] <Cork> krambiorix: height: auto;
[05:13:24] <Cork> but ya, the class is a cleaner solution
[05:13:38] <krambiorix> Cork, with height:auto  -> i can't see my content anymore :s
[05:13:49] <Cork> huh?
[05:14:04] <Cork> then you don't want streatch
[05:14:18] <Cork> donno what you're doing but your missing out on some info
[05:36:46] <StanAccy> Im looking at displaying an ordered list of items on screen but only showing the latest 10, disposing the earliest when #11 arrives.  Can this be easily done with jquery (and likely websockets) or should I just store this state server side and setup a JS timer to poll?
[05:42:05] <Cork> StanAccy: not sure what you mean
[05:42:14] <Cork> how is the list meant to be updated?
[05:42:20] <StanAccy> Im looking for a circular buffer like structure
[05:42:32] <StanAccy> updated either via timer poll on an ajax call, or via a WS push
[05:42:46] <Cork> i'm talking about visually
[05:42:47] <StanAccy> basically showing the last N items announced
[05:43:12] <StanAccy> a poor mans log/system watcher for error announcements
[05:44:20] <Cork> StanAccy: so you want something like a news ticker?
[05:45:29] <StanAccy> sort of.  I was thinking <ol><li>.... - this is just for a monitoring page
[05:45:46] <StanAccy> just show me the datetime of the last 10 errors that were announced on the platform
[05:45:51] <Cork> StanAccy: if the server knows when new "lines" comes in websocket is interesting
[05:46:01] <Cork> cause then you can just push out the new lines as the come
[05:46:09] <StanAccy> platform is event bus based so WS would be nicer
[05:46:13] <Cork> if the server doesn't know, then websocket doesn't really help
[05:46:30] <StanAccy> i just want the monitoring UIs to show the last N errors announced
[05:46:40] <StanAccy> its more of a flag at this stage
[05:46:52] <Cork> StanAccy: when the page loads just send out the last 10 errors
[05:47:07] <StanAccy> so tahts keeping it server side
[05:47:08] <Cork> and like i said if you can know when the errors happens you can push them over websocket
[05:47:19] <Cork> StanAccy: no, just the initial first list
[05:47:44] <StanAccy> its the circular buffer part on the client I was interested in - I can do the server side stuff with my eyes closed :-)
[05:47:45] <Cork> and a limit(10) isn't exactly doing it server side
[05:47:52] <StanAccy> ;-)
[05:47:58] <StanAccy> 'N' then :-)
[05:48:02] <Cork> StanAccy: your question doesn't really make sense
[05:48:11] <Cork> you don't use a buffer client side
[05:48:14] <StanAccy> if I keep pushing tot he browser, I cant keep appending to a list on the page
[05:48:22] <Cork> you just take the new elements add it to the li list
[05:48:27] <Cork> and remove the oldest one
[05:48:29] <StanAccy> so I need some sort of circular buffer type structure on the page
[05:48:36] <Cork> no you don't
[05:48:40] <Cork> why double store it?
[05:48:43] <StanAccy> er, yes I do :-)
[05:48:53] <Cork> oook?
[05:48:54] <StanAccy> but I just realized I can use first and :last-child
[05:48:54] <Cork> why?
[05:49:10] <Cork> that is dom based
[05:49:13] <StanAccy> as long as length > 10
[05:49:14] <Cork> not render based
[05:49:20] <StanAccy> still an effective strcture :-)
[05:49:31] <Cork> so if you insert it out of order you can't remove the last
[05:49:33] <StanAccy> I was wondering if there was anything around that would manage the N items to display on the client
[05:49:43] <Cork> StanAccy: $('
[05:49:45] <Cork> opps
[05:49:45] <StanAccy> events happen as they happen - order is as received
[05:50:02] <Cork> StanAccy: $('ol li').slice(10).remove()
[05:50:16] <StanAccy> slice. Nice, thanks - ill go check that out
[05:50:19] <xenaxon> Guys I am trying to make a CROP mask in PHP GD
[05:50:56] <xenaxon> I have an image 100x100pixels and another image with a solid color hexagon on a transparent background
[05:51:03] <StanAccy> Cork: So thats basically slicing off the 10th and all later ones
[05:51:10] <StanAccy> keeping the first 0..9
[05:51:17] <Cork> StanAccy: it selects all the lis inside the ol
[05:51:24] <StanAccy> starting at index 10, right?
[05:51:28] <xenaxon> I want to crop the 100x100px image with the transparent part of the mask
[05:51:28] <Cork> then creates a new array of the index 10+
[05:51:34] <StanAccy> which you then remove
[05:51:36] <Cork> and then .remove() runs on that
[05:51:46] <StanAccy> thats exactly what I was after 0- thanks!
[05:51:48] <xenaxon> any idea how?
[05:52:01] <Cork> StanAccy: that isn't a buffer though
[05:52:09] <Cork> its just a way to manage the dom elements
[05:52:20] <StanAccy> Cork: That isnt, but it achieves the same thing :-)
[05:52:34] <StanAccy> Im still relatively new to JS
[05:52:37] <Trisox> sup cork
[05:52:59] <StanAccy> Cork: Any views on any of the websocket libs out there?
[05:53:11] <StanAccy> or are they all much the same
[05:53:46] <Cork> StanAccy: i just use straight websocket
[05:53:48] <Trisox> Cork: how your doing
[05:54:05] <Cork> with a tiny wrapper i've written my self for long poll fallback
[05:54:19] <Cork> StanAccy: in all it is < 15 lines
[05:55:46] <Trisox> socket.io works good also
[05:55:55] <Trisox> very easy to implement
[05:56:04] <Cork> it falls back to commet though
[05:56:19] <Cork> and that causes a heck of a lot of load on the server
[05:56:56] <Cork> and really websocket is simple, why would you need a wrapper lib?
[05:57:11] <Trisox> if you want peer to peer you should prob use webrtc of some kind
[05:57:11] <StanAccy> well, we're firing off ajax timers left right and center right now :-)
[05:57:26] <StanAccy> no peer to peer - just client-server
[05:58:42] <Trisox> cork depends on the use case
[05:59:01] <Cork> Trisox: not really
[05:59:16] <Trisox> if you want binary ..
[05:59:19] <Cork> only use case where commet is better is if your backend is php, that can't handle long connections
[05:59:52] <Cork> the over head of negotiating ssl over and over again every 1-5 seconds is huge
[06:00:02] <Trisox> well i used socket.io with out any server stuff no backend
[06:00:06] <Trisox> works fine
[06:00:17] <Cork> uh what?
[06:00:20] <Trisox> if no suppor it falls back to flash
[06:00:29] <Cork> if you don't have a backend what does this have to do with websocket?
[06:00:45] <Trisox> oh i did use backend.. i see now
[06:00:45] <Trisox> ...
[06:00:50] <Trisox> node...
[06:00:52] <Trisox> never mind
[06:01:15] <Cork> ya socket.io is the main way of doing websocket on nodejs
[06:01:24] <Cork> it was mainly written for that
[06:01:33] <Trisox> works pretty smooth
[06:01:48] <Trisox> never used it for production env but for some playing it worked fine
[06:02:16] <Cork> ya, i wouldn't either, i don't think it would stand up for the load
[06:02:29] <Cork> (very few server send really do)
[06:02:45] <NikoZz> hi there
[06:02:47] <Cork> only ones i would trust with the job is python and go
[06:04:15] <NikoZz> I have this: <p class="smth"></p> { more html } <p class="smthElse"></p> how could I select ".smthElse" by clicking ".smth" ? I mean in a general way and not using direct the ".smthElse" class
[06:04:50] <Cork> NikoZz: you could do something like $('.smth').nextUntil('.smthElse')
[06:04:51] <NikoZz> I have many "smth" classes and many "smthElse" classes. What I need is by clicking the smth class to find the next "smthElse" class and not all of them
[06:04:55] <Trisox> all depends on how realtime it should be
[06:05:27] <Cork> Trisox: not really
[06:05:39] <Cork> it depends on how many users you will have
[06:06:05] <NikoZz> Cork: id doesnt seem to work with nextUntil
[06:06:08] <Trisox> butt poling can be pretty hard on your server as well
[06:06:26] <Cork> NikoZz: it should, at least with the example you gave
[06:06:37] <Cork> NikoZz: if it doesn't you would have to provide more context
[06:06:41] <Cork> ?paste @ NikoZz
[06:06:42] <b-ot> NikoZz: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:06:48] <Trisox> Cork:)
[06:07:14] <Cork> Trisox: that load doesn't mean much for the server language
[06:07:36] <Cork> Trisox: but yes load: commet > pulling > long pulling > websocket
[06:08:03] <Trisox> didnt know that
[06:08:07] <Cork> and pulling and long pulling is very close and depends on what you need to do
[06:08:14] <Cork> it can flip around
[06:08:43] <Cork> all the load websocket causes when you don't use it is the memory to keep the connection info
[06:08:59] <Cork> well and the low level ping/pong to make sure the other end is there
[06:09:18] <Trisox> used it to send data from my mobile acceleration data in stream
[06:09:26] <Trisox> to server and then to the desktop
[06:09:28] <Trisox> for fun
[06:09:35] <Trisox> worked pretty good
[06:09:38] <Trisox> that was a lottttt of calls
[06:10:00] <Trisox> 10 a second at least
[06:10:11] <Cork> lots of calls?
[06:10:15] <Cork> what calls?
[06:10:25] <Trisox> back and to the server
[06:10:33] <Trisox> to send it to lissing clients
[06:10:43] <Cork> that's the point websocket doesn't cause calls
[06:10:47] <Cork> its just socket packages
[06:10:55] <Trisox> well what ever you wanna call it
[06:10:55] <Cork> that is why it is so low weight
[06:10:55] <Trisox> :
[06:10:57] <Trisox> ;)
[06:11:31] <Cork> the only difference from a normal socket connection is that it is initiated as a normal http connection
[06:11:34] <Cork> and then upgraded
[06:11:40] <Trisox> still pretty bizzy in jquery channel been like year since i was he last
[06:11:46] <NikoZz> Cork: http://jsbin.com/bilerujexa/2/
[06:12:26] <Cork> NikoZz: there isn't anything between those two elements
[06:12:51] <Cork> ugg... i read your question wrong
[06:12:56] <NikoZz> :/
[06:13:02] <Cork> also please don't use jsbin
[06:13:13] <Cork> the site sucks and loses answers right left and center
[06:13:29] <NikoZz> ok then I normally use jsfiddle
[06:13:36] <Cork> already done
[06:13:38] <Cork> give me a min
[06:14:01] <Cork> NikoZz: http://jsfiddle.net/q8p14m0w/
[06:14:43] <NikoZz> Cork: You rock! Many many thanks :)))
[06:15:49] <Trisox> :)
[06:16:05] <Uhkis> mind = blown, Cork is anagram for rock
[06:16:17] <Cork> lol
[06:16:25] <Trisox> THE rock
[06:16:43] <NikoZz> hahahaha
[06:16:45] <NikoZz> true story
[06:16:56] <NikoZz> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/q8p14m0w/1/
[06:17:02] <NikoZz> I added an i tag
[06:17:07] <NikoZz> is there a solution to work this way too?
[06:17:19] <Cork> Uhkis: i've used this nick for close to 20 years and this is the first time me or anyone else has made that connection
[06:17:32] <Trisox> Cork: working with any other interessting framework and or libs latley?
[06:17:51] <Uhkis> Cork: mindblowing stuff! :D
[06:17:59] <Cork> Trisox: not really, i usually use quite few frameworks
[06:18:16] <Cork> and those are normally just compatibility layers
[06:18:26] <Trisox> true
[06:18:53] <Trisox> been using jquery lately again using jquery again to help some colege's out like last 2 moonds
[06:18:56] <Trisox> months
[06:18:57] <Cork> the latest i've used was raphael
[06:19:06] <Cork> or rather raphaël
[06:19:13] <Trisox> ah grapical stuff right
[06:19:24] <Cork> a compatibility layer for svg/vml
[06:19:43] <Trisox> yea took a look at it once
[06:19:44] <Cork> made inline svg actually usable
[06:20:18] <NikoZz> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12873027/jquery-forget-the-dom-structure-just-find-the-next-element-with-this-class
[06:20:19] <Cork> for straight vector i would prob not use it anymore
[06:20:23] <NikoZz> I guess this is the only way
[06:20:27] <Cork> but g.raphaël is still really nice
[06:20:41] <Trisox> i would love some time to take a dive in SMIL
[06:21:01] <Cork> ex. http://g.raphaeljs.com/piechart2.html
[06:21:18] <Cork> and http://raphaeljs.com/pie.html
[06:21:37] <Trisox> seen a talk by http://sarasoueidan.com/  <-- was pretty interesting stuff
[06:22:16] <Cork> ah, ya i know the svg standard
[06:22:29] <Trisox> also https://famo.us/ love to do stuff with that
[06:22:31] <Cork> the rapahël is mainly for when you need page integration
[06:22:54] <Cork> NikoZz: you don't want to do that
[06:23:00] <Trisox> i know
[06:23:11] <Cork> NikoZz: if you don't use dom structures you will lose performance
[06:23:14] <NikoZz> I already did and I got an error msg :p
[06:23:33] <NikoZz> so I guess theres no way to do it
[06:23:42] <NikoZz> I ll have to use different classes..
[06:24:08] <Cork> one min i haven't checked the jsfiddle yet
[06:24:15] * Cork blame Trisox ;P
[06:24:20] <Trisox> :D
[06:27:08] <Yatekii> guys is switchClass somehow not working anymore? :S
[06:27:26] <Cork> NikoZz: close enough? http://jsfiddle.net/q8p14m0w/2/
[06:28:10] <Cork> Yatekii: make sure you have jquery-ui loaded
[06:28:11] <Yatekii> Gut this code: http://pastebin.com/KZk4KwVx on that page: https://backdoor.yatekii.ch/list_tokens/ and it's not working at all :S
[06:28:21] <Yatekii> oh I don't just need jquery?
[06:28:32] <Yatekii> ah now I see it :S
[06:28:33] <Cork> switchClass is a jquery-ui command
[06:28:40] <Yatekii> fuck js seriously
[06:28:42] <Cork> you could just do toggleClass('class1'
[06:28:44] <Cork> opps
[06:28:45] <Yatekii> NO ERRORS at all
[06:28:49] <Cork> you could just do toggleClass('class1').toggleClass('class2')
[06:28:58] <Yatekii> ah that works without ui?
[06:29:00] <Cork> would do the same thing
[06:29:05] <Cork> ya
[06:29:13] <Yatekii> I just needa swap it out, no animations :)
[06:29:15] <Yatekii> tyvm!
[06:29:45] <Cork> you might want to use .addClass().removeClass()
[06:29:52] <Cork> if you want to always go in a specific direction
[06:30:15] <NikoZz> Cork: many many thanks!!
[06:30:37] <Trisox> lol ready the fiddle i was addBack  what the...  is that
[06:30:41] <Yatekii> yeah
[06:30:41] <Yatekii> hmm toggle doesnt work either :S
[06:31:49] <Cork> Trisox: it is the new name for andSelf
[06:31:54] <Cork> with a bit wider match
[06:32:13] <Yatekii> Cork: sadly doesnt work :S
[06:32:24] <Yatekii> and no errors at all :(
[06:32:25] <supsup> sup
[06:32:33] <Cork> Yatekii: what did you use?
[06:32:38] <Trisox> yea looked it up what was not there when i used jquery like year ago
[06:32:39] <Yatekii> add/remove
[06:32:45] <Yatekii> toggle didnt work either ;)
[06:32:55] <Trisox> been working with mvc based stuff more or less lately
[06:33:00] <Cork> Yatekii: .addClass('glyphicon-pencil').removeClass('glyphicon-ok'); should work just fine
[06:33:04] <supsup> y'all got a jsfiddle of what your talking about?
[06:33:21] <Cork> Yatekii: though you try to use the function on the dom element
[06:33:24] <Cork> that won't work
[06:33:33] <Cork> remove the [0]
[06:33:34] <supsup> maybe he is using a '.' in the add class string
[06:35:57] <Yatekii> Cork: doesn't do the job :( you can check on https://backdoor.yatekii.ch/list_tokens/ if you belive I do it utterly wrong :)
[06:36:13] <Cork> Yatekii: try reproducing what you need in jsfiddle
[06:36:25] <Cork> it is hard to debug a dead pb
[06:36:32] <Yatekii> pb?
[06:36:38] <Cork> pastebin
[06:36:53] <Cork> no context and no rendering
[06:39:52] <Trisox> plnkr en codepen and jsfiddle are best options for thouse things
[06:39:55] <Trisox> if you aks me
[06:39:57] <Trisox> ask
[06:40:22] <Cork> codepen is ok but provides less helpful features
[06:40:56] <Yatekii> ok Cork here ya go http://jsfiddle.net/qncpfj9r/ I am trying to change the pencil ito a checkmark
[06:41:07] <Cork> the tidy is a big help when you get badly pasted code all day :)
[06:41:12] <Yatekii> so change class glyphicon-pencil to glyphicon-ok
[06:41:50] <Cork> Yatekii: ouch this has problems on several levels
[06:42:14] <Cork> Yatekii: you should never ever do $().click(func) (or anything like it) in an each loop
[06:42:21] <Cork> its a good sign your doing something wrong
[06:43:22] <Yatekii> but I have several buttons and want to assign the same event to each.
[06:43:27] <Yatekii> with it's specific id of cours
[06:43:28] <Yatekii> e
[06:43:32] <Yatekii> I used each and click before
[06:43:42] <Yatekii> I blevieve you that this is bad
[06:43:54] <Yatekii> but I do not believe its the root of my problem here :) but teach me wrong ;)
[06:43:57] <Cork> Yatekii: also what is if(span.length == 1){ meant to do?
[06:44:03] <Cork> why do you feel you need it?
[06:44:39] <Yatekii> well he button should change to an ok sign if its a pencil sign and if its an ok sign (would be when it finds no elemnts thus lenght==0) it should submit the form ;)
[06:45:11] <Yatekii> (as well later on that event should unlock the input field which should be locked previously so you can not change things by accident
[06:45:58] <Cork> Yatekii: http://jsfiddle.net/qncpfj9r/1/
[06:47:03] <Cork> Yatekii: and for the later comment http://jsfiddle.net/qncpfj9r/2/
[06:47:34] <Yatekii> ur a god!
[06:47:39] <Yatekii> no u understood me wrong ;)
[06:47:43] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/qncpfj9r/3/  <-- heh almost was in progress but u beat me Cork
[06:47:52] <Yatekii> if it's glyphicon-ok it should only trigger the default
[06:47:53] <Yatekii> ;)
[06:47:55] <supsup> i like your solution better so i gave up
[06:47:56] <Yatekii> nothing else
[06:48:01] <Yatekii> but I can do that on my own!
[06:48:03] <Yatekii> tyvm!
[06:48:39] <supsup> the way he was using $.each is that even valid?  I've never seen it used that way
[06:48:57] <Cork> it is, but like i said you should never ever bind events in a loop
[06:49:12] <Cork> well not ever; there is one situation you should
[06:49:32] <supsup> what is the case?
[06:49:33] <Cork> when there is a broken lib in the page that does stopPropagation() on and event you need
[06:49:43] <Cork> then you have to add it directly to those elements
[06:49:47] <Cork> or fix the broken lib
[06:49:50] <supsup> ah
[06:49:53] <supsup> cool
[06:49:59] <Cork> (so ya, never use stopPropagation())
[06:50:20] <Cork> i learned that the hard way...
[06:50:25] <Trisox> return false :p
[06:50:43] <Cork> that is ten times worse
[06:50:52] <Trisox> :p
[06:50:55] <Trisox> haha
[06:51:26] <Cork> i actively refuse to take plugins/lib that use return false; in event handlers
[06:51:48] <Cork> stopPropagation at least mean they know dom has moved on from the 90's
[06:52:07] <Cork> document.write/writeln is another dead ringer
[06:52:11] <Yatekii> well cork how would you make sure if the glyphicon is ok or pencil then? :S
[06:52:20] <Yatekii> if not by length == 0?
[06:52:22] <Yatekii> or == 1
[06:52:30] <Cork> Yatekii: the element should never have both
[06:52:39] <Cork> so the toggle should take care of that problem
[06:52:40] <Yatekii> exactly
[06:52:42] <Yatekii> no
[06:52:46] <Cork> no?
[06:52:46] <Yatekii> I just told you :D
[06:53:05] <Cork> in what case would the code have to handle both existing?
[06:53:08] <Yatekii> if it has the glyphicon-ok it should execute default and no toggle and nothing else
[06:53:12] <Cork> ah
[06:53:15] <Cork> THAT part
[06:53:19] <Yatekii> ;)
[06:53:25] <Cork> though you talked about something else ^^'
[06:53:33] <Yatekii> :D
[06:53:35] <Cork> hasClass() should work
[06:53:43] <Yatekii> ah nice
[06:53:46] <Cork> just cache the selection from the .find() and run it on that element
[06:53:48] <Yatekii> I don't know so much :S
[06:54:19] <Cork> Yatekii: no prob, you'll learn over time
[06:55:16] <Cork> Yatekii: http://jsfiddle.net/qncpfj9r/4/
[06:55:34] <Cork> man i get a flash back to Z when i typed that XD
[06:55:44] <supsup> What is Z?
[06:55:47] <Yatekii> yeah tyvm!
[06:55:51] <Cork> ?g z wiki game
[06:55:53] <b-ot> Cork: Z (video game) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia â†’ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(video_game)
[06:56:05] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to trigger a popup colorbox on submit: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8a0480fa17833384c6aa
[06:57:35] <Yatekii> hmm I don't get when I got a jquery object and when not oO
[06:57:37] <Yatekii> so weird
[06:57:37] <supsup> dang that's an old game.  Surprised I've never heard of it
[06:58:04] <Cork> Yatekii: every thing $() or any function returned from one of its function is basically always a jquery object
[06:58:09] <supsup> if you use a selector and it returns something you have a jquery object
[06:58:27] <Cork> Yatekii: * every thing $() or any function returnes is basically always a jquery object
[06:58:33] <Yatekii> well I used find before and I had to reapply $()
[06:58:37] <Cork> supsup: its more then that
[06:58:53] <supsup> yah but it's just returning the chained selecgtor right?
[06:58:57] <Cork> Yatekii: $() is a function this function returns a jquery object
[06:59:04] <supsup> so technically it was the selector that made the jquery object no?
[06:59:11] <Cork> this object has the .find, .filter and so on function on it
[06:59:21] <Cork> those function also return a jquery object
[06:59:32] <Cork> that is what makes it possible to chain the function calls
[06:59:41] <Yatekii> hmm
[06:59:42] <supsup> can you get a jquery object without having a selector first tho?
[06:59:51] <Cork> supsup: its the call to $() it doesn't have to be a selector
[07:00:00] <Cork> supsup: $(this)
[07:00:09] <supsup> but to use that you had to have a selector?
[07:00:16] <Cork> no
[07:00:27] <Cork> $(document) might be a better example
[07:00:32] <Cork> or $(document.body)
[07:00:39] <supsup> but that's a selector
[07:00:42] <Cork> no
[07:00:48] <Cork> its a dom element not a selector
[07:01:05] <supsup> how are they not the same thing
[07:01:33] <Cork> supsup: a selector is the syntax you write in css like 'div > span.c'
[07:01:48] <Cork> dom elements is something variables or properties refer to
[07:01:53] <supsup> thought dom was part of selector syntax
[07:01:59] <Cork> no
[07:02:19] <Cork> dom existed many years before css selectors existed
[07:02:24] <supsup> element selector?
[07:02:44] <Cork> the closest to "element selectors" that exist is xpath
[07:02:49] <Cork> and no not the same thing
[07:03:08] <Cork> supsup: sounds like you should read up on dom tree
[07:03:26] <supsup> jquery api prob needs to be updated ;-0
[07:03:45] <supsup> http://api.jquery.com/element-selector/
[07:04:04] <Cork> supsup: that is something else
[07:04:10] <Cork> that is a part of css selectors
[07:04:21] <Cork> its the specific part where you can match an element tag name
[07:04:53] <supsup> hurm can you give me another example
[07:05:16] <Cork> 'div', 'a', 'iframe', 'img' <-- all element selectors
[07:05:25] <supsup> naw i mean of your other one
[07:05:34] <Cork> my other one?
[07:05:46] <supsup> nm I see
[07:05:53] <supsup> yah i don't use that much, maybe I should
[07:05:56] <supsup> like $(document)
[07:06:01] <leslie> xpath is a bit more expressive in that you can traverse upwards. I don't think you can do that with css selectors, can you?
[07:06:13] <Cork> $(document).ready(function() {}) is quite commonly used
[07:06:25] <supsup> yah i use shorthand version
[07:06:37] <Cork> leslie: yes xpath is much slower then css selectors
[07:06:39] <supsup> so I guess i forget about it
[07:06:51] <Cork> and i mean MUCH slower
[07:07:04] <supsup> what are other use cases for using dom elements?
[07:07:09] <Cork> last i checked it ranges between 10x and 50x slower
[07:07:19] <leslie> huh, I've never checked
[07:07:24] <supsup> vs selectors
[07:07:37] <Cork> supsup: if you have an element and want to use jquery on it
[07:07:40] <NoiseEee> supsup: an html document is made up DOM elements. you use 'selectors' or 'queries' to grab them.
[07:07:48] <Cork> while selectors is for if you don't have the element
[07:07:58] <supsup> yah so I use selectors all the time
[07:08:09] <fffxxxckk> Hey, has anyone seen jquery plugin/extension that could do the same stuff as angular $animates addClass does? https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate/service/$animate#addClass
[07:08:16] <Cork> you should prob cache the response most of the time
[07:08:22] <Cork> selectors can be a bit costly
[07:08:33] <supsup> are these two equivlant?  $(document.body) vs $("body")
[07:08:37] <Cork> yes
[07:08:57] <Cork> and in modern browsers they should be about the same speed too
[07:08:57] <supsup> guess i need to see more examples of the first one in action
[07:09:03] <supsup> I see the second one all the time
[07:09:20] <Cork> supsup: what you should do is look into dom elements
[07:09:28] <Cork> cause there is where you are having problem now
[07:09:28] <NoiseEee> supsup: but what those return are very different, right
[07:09:29] <supsup> i understand dom well I think
[07:09:30] <Yatekii> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/qncpfj9r/7/ I wanted to ask you what's wrong about line 6 (why it doesnt change the readonly attribute) but it seems that on jsfiddle that code fails in general (it doesnt on my page (icon changes, but remains readonly on the input fiels))
[07:09:43] <Cork> NoiseEee: those two return the exact same thing
[07:09:45] <supsup> they seem to return the same thing NoiseEE
[07:09:58] <fffxxxckk> it basically adds extra classes upon addClass(), -add, -add-active, checks for transition/animation duration and removes them afterwards(http://i.stack.imgur.com/UuaJi.png), which is really helpful
[07:10:17] <NoiseEee> sorry i somehow read gEBID('document.body')
[07:10:19] <Cork> NoiseEee: to expand on it a bit those two are the same as $(document.body) and $(document.querySelectorAll('body'))
[07:10:32] <Cork> and the result is exactly the same element returned
[07:10:38] <NoiseEee> yes Cork
[07:10:53] <fffxxxckk> related SO question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28047111/angular-animates-addclass-removeclass-in-jqueryas-jquery-plugin-without-angu
[07:11:31] <supsup> I understand dom tree well I think, just don't see the $(document) syntax much
[07:11:42] <supsup> where i see the selector syntax all the time
[07:11:47] <Cork> Yatekii: again you try to run jquery functions on the dom
[07:12:04] <Cork> Yatekii: http://jsfiddle.net/qncpfj9r/8/
[07:12:05] <Yatekii> dam
[07:12:07] <Yatekii> ty
[07:12:13] <supsup> but it appears this is because it's abstracted away from us
[07:12:50] <Cork> supsup: if you understood what a dom element is you wouldn't have a problem seeing where the difference is
[07:13:10] <Cork> i suspect you know what html elements is and css element selectors
[07:13:13] <Cork> but not the dom
[07:13:42] <Cork> dom element != html element
[07:14:15] <Yatekii> hmm Cork now it says $().parnet().sibling() doesn't work :S
[07:14:26] <Trisox> parent
[07:14:37] <Cork> ?api siblings
[07:14:37] <b-ot> Cork: .siblings(): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[07:14:41] <Cork> not sibling
[07:16:35] <Yatekii> dam...
[07:16:39] <Yatekii> seriously I suck hard
[07:17:03] <Yatekii> sibling() was the one where I had to put a number to select one as argument
[07:17:52] <Yatekii> sadly it throws no error now, which is nice :) but still doesnt throw any error :(
[07:18:11] <Cork> Yatekii: inspect each step in the chain
[07:18:16] <Yatekii> oki
[07:18:18] <Cork> and make sure you actually get the elements you want
[07:18:22] <Yatekii> yeah
[07:18:22] <islalobo> How can I control the length of time this colorbox appears for? It isn't staying up for long enough: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c22e72cad79e8f7980c6
[07:18:25] <Cork> console.log() is your friend
[07:20:52] <cjohnson> islalobo: probably a question for the documentation of that particular plugin?
[07:21:41] <BillCriswell> leslie: Not yet. =(
[07:21:48] <BillCriswell> Oh, didn't scroll.
[07:24:07] <Yatekii> Cork: ur a god ty!
[07:24:10] <Yatekii> and very patient
[07:25:22] <islalobo> cjohnson: I thought colorbox was just jquery
[07:25:45] <cjohnson> well definitely not just jquery
[07:25:53] <cjohnson> but googling it doesn't appear to be part of jquery-ui either
[07:25:57] <cjohnson> https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=colorbox
[07:27:47] <islalobo> cjohnson: http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/
[07:28:03] <islalobo> Yeah, no just jquery, so you're right. I think that is the documentation
[07:28:09] <cjohnson> mhm
[07:28:22] <islalobo> 'speed' or '$colorbox.close'
[07:28:27] <islalobo> seems to be my answer
[07:46:18] <Yatekii> Cork: http://pastebin.com/xZ9KgpwD I now put everything into a script instead of the <script> tags and just call that function in the <script> tags where that code was before ... but It doesnt work properly anymore :S
[07:46:22] <Yatekii> any idea?
[08:03:39] <fffxxxckk> none? anyone? plnkr.co/edit/HNWCMkKgcV2rnynMdUvP?p=preview  this is example how such addClass() could be useful in jquery
[08:06:15] <Trisox> fffxxxckk: wy use jquery for that?
[08:06:33] <BillCriswell> I... don't follow.
[08:06:54] <fffxxxckk> because I want to use the same addClass functionality on a project where I am not using angular
[08:06:54] <Trisox> fffxxxckk: use ngClass and toggle class onclick with controller
[08:07:08] <fffxxxckk> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28047111/angular-animates-addclass-removeclass-in-jqueryas-jquery-plugin-without-angu
[08:08:47] <Trisox> fffxxxckk: just do button with an function like clickme() and do in the controller $scope.clickme() { $scope.animation = 'go' } and then ng-class="{{go}}"
[08:09:23] <Trisox> using plain jquery inside controller is not good usecase use directive then ...  so you can access the element in your link function
[08:09:51] <fffxxxckk> Trisox ... read the SO question, I am NOT using angular, I am looking for a plugin/extension to jquery, that would provide the same functionality and angular $animate.addClass() has
[08:10:49] <Trisox> fffxxxckk: .addClass is jquery ?
[08:11:59] <Trisox> fffxxxckk: so something like $('#someDiv') .click(function(){ $(this).stop().animate( {backgroundColor:'blue'}, {duration:500}); }) ??
[08:12:53] <Trisox> fffxxxckk: or do you use css animations ? then just $('#someDiv') .click(function(){ $('toanimate').addclass('doanimation')});
[08:20:17] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[08:23:07] <Trisox> fffxxxckk: any luck ?
[08:23:44] <Omar-> hi arthurvr
[08:23:58] <arthurvr> Hi Omar-!
[08:24:09] <Omar-> you're late today :P
[08:24:15] <arthurvr> haha
[08:24:21] <arthurvr> for some reason we stay meeting :)
[08:24:53] <fffxxxckk> Trisox ..... have read that SO? I can not do it, because when you are transitioning certain stuff, like opacity, and the "doanimation" class has display: none;, its not gonna transition at all, that is why $animate.addClass() is useful, because it lets you set the transition up, using extra class, which keeps the element display: block until the transition ends
[08:24:56] <Omar-> good luck :)
[08:25:03] <fffxxxckk> and that is the whole point, I want the same thing in jquery
[08:25:32] <fffxxxckk> gah...
[08:26:00] <Trisox> pff you could just added an extra class..
[08:26:14] <Trisox> that you get for trying to help beh..
[08:47:17] <islalobo> How can I call a jquery event on a input field name? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5f699ca0f4d707635bd4
[08:47:17] <islalobo> I am trying to create a condition where the popup box only appears under certain conditions
[08:48:04] <NoiseEee> islalobo: but after the user has submitted the form?
[08:49:36] <islalobo> NoiseEee: yeah, the only trigger event we have available is the submit button. I'm dealing with another issue of lost form submitted values because there are two forms. But I need this issue to be fixed as well - the issue of conditionally showing the popup
[08:49:57] <islalobo> You'll see some commented-out code in the little jquery snippet
[08:50:36] <NoiseEee> islalobo: well offhand i suppose that seems correct, whats the issue (aside from not stopping the 'submit' event) ?
[08:53:26] <islalobo> NoiseEee: If I target #edit-submitted-email-layout-email-fields-optinreceiveemails-1 then the submit event is stopped. However, is is always stopped. That is because the value= of  that input field is "0"
[08:53:42] <islalobo> input type=select value=0
[08:54:09] <islalobo> So I need to be able to target, in my js, when [0] => ' '
[08:54:25] <robertmaxrees> you want to prevent default when an input's value = ' '?
[08:54:27] <islalobo> When no select option is chosen. I thought maybe I could do it by the name=
[08:54:54] <islalobo> I want the popup to appear when the that field is left blank and submit is clicked, yes.
[08:55:22] <robertmaxrees> i didn't see the original question, but that's pretty trivial.
[08:56:10] <NoiseEee> islalobo: im not sure what's not working?
[08:56:33] <islalobo> I am trying to target a specific select value
[08:57:13] <NoiseEee>  $( "input[name='submitted[email_layout][email_fields][optInReceiveEmails][0]']" ).val() === '') should do it
[08:57:53] <NoiseEee> if that element's value is nothing (''), then sure your .colorbox thing should work
[08:58:12] <islalobo> hrm, it doesn't appear to be working
[08:59:31] <Cr0vaX> hi there
[09:00:15] <Cr0vaX> I'm trying to validate form with array of items, but it get's submitted if I add 2 fields and only the first is valid, any clues? http://jsfiddle.net/cr0vax/pdqfbmxk/8/
[09:03:06] <robertmaxrees> probably because .validate() is only aware of fields that exist when you init it.
[09:03:27] <robertmaxrees> also, your second $(document).on('click', '.input-group-addon-remove', function () { is a bad idea.
[09:03:36] <NoiseEee> islalobo: double-check your selector, etc etc... throw some 'debugger' statements in and get to work :)
[09:03:40] <robertmaxrees> wait nvm ignore me.
[09:04:11] <Cr0vaX> robertmaxrees:ty for responses, the add and remove buttons is working fine imo, the problem is the validate :(
[09:04:34] <robertmaxrees> Cr0vaX right - because the validator isn't aware of things that are added after you init it.
[09:04:58] <Cr0vaX> any workaround?
[09:05:08] <robertmaxrees> which validator are you using?
[09:05:14] <Cr0vaX> jquery validator
[09:05:47] <Cr0vaX> http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[09:06:06] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18022224/jquery-validation-plugin-doesnt-validate-dynamically-created-form-elements read this and see if it helps.
[09:06:44] <islalobo> NoiseEee: I'm not sure what you mean 'debugger' statements
[09:07:01] <robertmaxrees> islalobo check out http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[09:07:18] <robertmaxrees> it'll give you a great rundown on how to debug your own code using your browser's built-in debugger :)
[09:11:38] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: thank you
[09:11:41] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[09:12:20] <robertmaxrees> debugging is probably the single most important skill you'll learn as a developer.
[09:12:47] <arthurvr> 100% agreed on that last statement
[09:18:16] <echoSMILE> I have some simple js code that was working, and now don't work with any special eason. I'm using jquery version 1.11.2 and the code is the next line: $( window ).scroll(function() {console.log( $(this).scrollTop() );});
[09:18:28] <echoSMILE> *reason
[09:18:37] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[09:18:40] <echoSMILE> nop
[09:19:13] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?  the console.log() doesn't fire?
[09:19:18] <gtristan> echoSMILE, git bisect
[09:19:44] <gtristan> something unrelated in your code base has changed, possibly also effecting scroll position at the same time
[09:19:49] <echoSMILE> robertmaxrees: everything inside $( window ).scroll(function() {   });  dont work
[09:19:54] <gtristan> just find the commit which broke it ;-)
[09:20:31] <arthurvr> echoSMILE: a reduced testcase might be handy
[09:20:41] <robertmaxrees> was just about to suggest that.
[09:20:50] <arthurvr> echoSMILE: also, might be stupid question, but are you actually scrolling?
[09:20:54] <echoSMILE> gtristan: hum sure, but that code is a bit generic
[09:21:00] <arthurvr> quite an important thing for  event ;)
[09:21:13] <echoSMILE> arthurvr: what do you mean?
[09:21:59] <robertmaxrees> echoSMILE is the window actually scrolling? or a child element? etc.
[09:21:59] <echoSMILE> I didn't read your question, sure I am :P
[09:22:22] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lepcv0f2/ works.
[09:22:23] <echoSMILE> I resize the window just to create some scrollbar
[09:22:39] <gtristan> echoSMILE, just saying, you can spend time trying to diagnose what exactly causes this, or you can find the commit in your codebase which introduces the problem, which will also give you the answer, often the latter will save you time and you will learn the same thing
[09:23:24] <echoSMILE> robertmaxrees: weird, don't work for me :/
[09:23:31] <robertmaxrees> echoSMILE in your console?
[09:23:34] <echoSMILE> yes
[09:23:38] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not filtering out console logs.
[09:23:50] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you in?
[09:24:02] <arthurvr> echoSMILE: make sure youâ€™re not filtring console, and maybe try in private mode of your browser
[09:24:32] <arthurvr> Iâ€™m asking because then all extensions are turned off
[09:24:45] <echoSMILE> firefox
[09:25:06] <arthurvr> echoSMILE: version and os please :)
[09:25:26] <echoSMILE> win 34.0.5
[09:25:38] <robertmaxrees> echoSMILE in the dev tools, click on the "logging" section and make sure logging is one.
[09:25:40] <robertmaxrees> *on
[09:27:26] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/xaJM7Vf.png
[09:28:21] <echoSMILE> SecurityError: The operation is insecure.
[09:28:27] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[09:28:42] <echoSMILE> Appear that error in my firebug
[09:28:57] <arthurvr> thatâ€™s not an issue with that jquery thing
[09:29:16] <arthurvr> Itâ€™s same-origin policy stuff I believe
[09:30:01] <arthurvr> echoSMILE: fyi http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy
[09:30:37] <echoSMILE> I think my browser are stupid. now that error don't appear and the thing works
[09:30:39] <echoSMILE> :/
[09:30:43] <echoSMILE> *is
[09:30:51] <arthurvr> :)
[09:33:39] <stangeland> how do you guys usually handle userinpu where both date and time needs to be entered? Which user controls are you using?
[09:33:49] <robertmaxrees> date/timepickers.
[09:34:07] <stangeland> robertmaxrees, is there one that combines both date and time?
[09:34:14] <arthurvr> stangeland: input[type=datetime]
[09:34:41] <robertmaxrees> ^ otherwise, you'll need to check out using two of them, which isn't uncommon.
[09:35:09] <robertmaxrees> btw http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-datetime
[09:35:21] <echoSMILE> tks
[09:35:48] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: polyfills enough :)
[09:35:55] <arthurvr> anyway Iâ€™m afk for a while
[09:35:57] <stangeland> arthurvr, it dont work: http://jsfiddle.net/2n22t3xe/
[09:36:17] <arthurvr> stangeland: because of its browser support (see above)
[09:36:30] <stangeland> arthurvr, i am in newest chrome
[09:36:36] <stangeland> arthurvr, surely that supports it
[09:37:25] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#Browser_compatibility
[09:37:26] <robertmaxrees> btw
[09:38:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/2n22t3xe/1/ will work, though might not be what you want.
[09:38:50] <robertmaxrees> chrome "recognizes" type="datetime" but doesn't have any UI for it.
[09:53:22] <draconusdesigns> Can anyone assist with a jquery ui sortable question?
[09:53:32] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question :)
[09:53:37] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[09:54:30] <draconusdesigns> It reorders the elements in the dom, or so it appears, right? So when the form submits, if the text fields are named field_name[], should it not post in PHP in the proper order?
[09:54:46] <draconusdesigns> If not, then how do I make sure it does store in the proper order?
[09:55:16] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't rely on DOM order and find another way to guarantee order.
[09:56:37] <Cr0vaX> is there nicer alternative to http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[09:57:19] <draconusdesigns> For validation, i use Parsley.js
[09:57:30] <draconusdesigns> http://parsleyjs.org/
[09:57:32] <draconusdesigns> I like it
[09:57:38] <arthurvr> Cr0vaX: not a real alternative, but Iâ€™d suggest you to use html5 form validation where possible
[09:58:18] <Cr0vaX> arthurvr:  I use it, and it's nice, but it get's worst when I need to make ajax calls
[09:59:10] <arthurvr> Cr0vaX: totally agreed, it has itâ€™s cons (for now)
[09:59:26] <arthurvr> ~its
[09:59:40] <Cr0vaX> but for most of the static fields it's quite enough
[10:22:38] <arup_r> I am not seeing the alert which I should see 5 times... https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/45682f3ee5f8bb0762c4 Can anyone tell me where am I wrong?
[10:24:21] <Cr0vaX> ok I got it working using jQuery Validation http://jsfiddle.net/cr0vax/pdqfbmxk/13/ we need to remove the rules from the field I'm copying, and re-add the rules again
[10:25:11] <Cr0vaX> also to handle arrays I had to add a random ID in each field I create like year[678]
[10:25:47] <Cr0vaX> the re-add rules is only necessary for different messages, for default messages is not necessary
[10:25:50] <DjMadness> I was wondering, does anyone have some suggestions for cleaning up the code of the javascript ? http://jsfiddle.net/cxy89zqf/1/ its working but i feel its made more complex than it actually is.
[10:26:54] <pentagrass> DjMadness: That's one messy script
[10:29:02] <DjMadness> pentagrass: i agree, but i cant think what i can do to clean it up.

[10:31:28] <arup_r> I am not seeing the alert which I should see 5 times... https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/45682f3ee5f8bb0762c4 Can anyone tell me where am I wrong?
[10:31:41] <notchris> Is there a way to test hammer.js touch actions without a mobile device?
[10:31:43] <arup_r> already said.. no body :(
[10:32:00] <arthurvr> arup_r: are you sure the back end is setup right?
[10:32:09] <arthurvr> arup_r: does it throw anything in the console?
[10:32:29] <arup_r> Yes.. I got the data from backend.. when I added the if condition.. nothing is coming
[10:32:43] <arup_r> Let me update the Gist with console data
[10:33:28] <arup_r> updated https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/45682f3ee5f8bb0762c4
[10:33:43] <arthurvr> that json_object is actually an object?
[10:35:04] <arup_r> How can I see the class of the `data` object ?
[10:35:16] <arup_r> what is the method available in Jquery?
[10:35:33] <w3gi> that dont work: http://jsfiddle.net/y20tkpkn/1/
[10:35:45] <w3gi> does someone know the problem please?
[10:36:14] <robertmaxrees> w3gi http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y20tkpkn/2/
[10:36:15] <arthurvr> w3gi: PreventEvent?
[10:36:26] <robertmaxrees> need to pass the event object to the handler and call the right method on it.
[10:37:08] <arup_r> me?
[10:37:13] <robertmaxrees> w3gi
[10:37:20] <arup_r> ohh
[10:38:04] <arup_r> arthurvr: "arup_r: does it throw anything in the console?" No it is clean
[10:42:48] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, thx - works now
[10:43:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:43:47] <w3gi> but funny - in chrome and IE it worked even without function(event){...
[10:44:07] <robertmaxrees> because your return false; was trying to handle it.  still not a valid thing to do.
[10:44:25] <robertmaxrees> *"not valid" irt what you had before.
[10:44:55] <w3gi> irt?
[10:45:01] <robertmaxrees> 'in regards to'
[10:45:09] <w3gi> OK
[10:53:38] <raidr> any idear how i can handle this HideSeek with a search on click function? http://jsfiddle.net/Ly3azuea/
[10:53:44] <mrchris> Hi All
[10:54:03] <mrchris> How do I make the scroll bar not go off the bottom of the page in this fixed div?  Here's an example:  http://jsfiddle.net/8wuo4xx9/  .   I'm pulling my hair out over this one!
[10:54:43] <robertmaxrees> mrchris not sure what you mean.
[10:55:28] <robertmaxrees> you mean you don't want the page to scroll?
[10:55:35] <mrchris> robertmaxrees: If you look at the fiddle you can see that you don't see the bottom of the scroll bar: it goes off the bottom of the screen.
[10:55:46] <mrchris> robertmaxrees: no, just the div with the scroll bar
[10:56:26] <arup_r> How can I display only value of the name key ?  http://s8.postimg.org/bx5m5xdlh/json.png and https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/45682f3ee5f8bb0762c4
[10:56:27] <mrchris> I need that div to be fixed and to fill the height of the screen (Except the margin at the top), but the scrollbar is missing from the bottom
[10:57:10] <mrchris> So there are bits of the div I cannot see.  I know it's because I've set the height to 100%, but not sure how to do it properly so it fills the screen and I can see all of the scrollbar
[10:57:52] <robertmaxrees> mrchris i'd hard set a height on that container, but I'm not entirely sure what the "right" way is - the guys in #css might know better?
[10:58:16] <mrchris> robertmaxrees: all is silent in #css :-(
[10:58:24] <raidr> any idear how i can handle this HideSeek with a search on click function? http://jsfiddle.net/Ly3azuea/1/
[10:58:34] <robertmaxrees> mrchris just a suggestion ;)
[10:58:59] <mrchris> robertmaxrees: the screen could resize though, and i'd rather avoid using JS if possible
[10:59:14] <robertmaxrees> mrchris that's why i suggested #css ;)
[10:59:29] <mrchris> robertmaxrees: yeah, i appreciate it
[11:00:09] <arup_r> Any body can give me the idea?
[11:00:19] <robertmaxrees> arup_r http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/edvt9xwk/
[11:00:41] <robertmaxrees> arup_r that example should show you how to get the "key" and "value" out of an object.
[11:01:39] <arup_r> why my previous == didn't work
[11:01:53] <arup_r> .each(key, val) { .. }
[11:02:19] <robertmaxrees> arup_r i didn't see your earlier fiddle.
[11:02:41] <arup_r> How can I display only value of the name key ?  http://s8.postimg.org/bx5m5xdlh/json.png and https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/45682f3ee5f8bb0762c4
[11:02:48] <arup_r> I have a gist
[11:02:59] <arup_r> robertmaxrees: ^^
[11:03:18] <robertmaxrees> can you have me an example of the data that gets returned?
[11:03:27] <robertmaxrees> in the browser i mean.
[11:03:37] <raidr> robertmaxrees > any idear how i can handle this HideSeek with a search on click function? http://jsfiddle.net/Ly3azuea/1/
[11:04:54] <robertmaxrees> raidr do you have any documentation about that plugin?
[11:05:11] <raidr> robertmaxrees: yes here: http://vdw.github.io/HideSeek/
[11:06:31] <raidr> it looks not like a full documentation
[11:06:50] <robertmaxrees> raidr doesn't look like they support it out of the box.  pop open the source and look to see what events they care about on that input
[11:07:49] <raidr> yes this is what i did
[11:07:51] <robertmaxrees> you can then .trigger() that event
[11:07:57] <raidr> but i don get rid
[11:08:28] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that,
[11:09:27] <raidr> this is the source http://pastebin.com/Tuvj0Pgp
[11:09:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to do it for you ;)
[11:10:09] <robertmaxrees> it'll looks something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Ly3azuea/2/
[11:11:12] <raidr> i think is triggers key by key
[11:11:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:11:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Ly3azuea/3/
[11:11:29] <robertmaxrees> here you go ;)
[11:11:32] <robertmaxrees> next time, read the docs :)
[11:11:36] <robertmaxrees> and the source code.
[11:11:44] <raidr> lmfao
[11:12:20] <raidr> i donate 3$ for a coffee for ya
[11:12:31] <robertmaxrees> nah. s'all good.
[11:12:39] <raidr> kk thx bra
[11:23:14] <kuatsure> looking for a way to layout data attributes so that when I do `.data()` it'll return object similar to { id: 1, related: { id: 23, type: 'subNav' } } domObj is <div class="js-quickLink-btn" data-id="2" data-related-type="subNav" data-related-id="2">there</div> ... this returns a camelCased obj {id: 2, relatedType: "subNav", relatedId: 2}, thanks all :0
[11:23:44] <robertmaxrees> kuatsure i wouldn't do that if you can avoid it.
[11:23:58] <kuatsure> reason why?
[11:24:21] <kuatsure> it's not a huge concern, I'm more curious if it's possible to be honest
[11:24:36] <robertmaxrees> it's possible, but data attributes are great for a few samll bits of info.  complex objects are kind of munging your document.
[11:25:21] <kuatsure> right, and that's fine, I was just wonder if I have to lay them out differently like `data-related--id="1" data-related--type="subNav"`
[11:25:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:25:46] <kuatsure> never was intending to store a stringified obj
[11:25:46] <robertmaxrees> not for what you want.
[11:27:38] <kuatsure> ah, ok, thanks robertmaxrees
[11:27:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there's no special formatting for what you're looking to do without doing http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u32wyzkf/
[11:28:13] <kuatsure> ok, yeah, I have no desire to store something like that in a data-attr
[11:30:40] <reyley> Not really a jquery question, but maybe someone can help me out. I am writing a site where people can watch videos and I have a points system. Currently, I'm playing with the idea that everytime someone watches a video, they are rewarded with points. The problem is validating their "watch". In order to disallow people from POSTing to a reward route and abusing the points system, I thought of
[11:30:40] <reyley> adding a hash in addition to the post request whenever someone watches a video. The hash is generated in the video page and stored in a database with a foreign key relating to an episode. Whenever the timer script on the episode page passes a significant amount of the video's total length (let's say 60%), then it POSTs to the reward route with the hash as a parameter. The handler at the end of
[11:30:41] <reyley> the reward route then checks if the hash is valid, and if so expires (and deletes) the current hash and gives points to the user. But now i can see the problem where instead of watching the video, people load the page and grab the hash and immediately POST to the reward route and claim points. Is there anyway to really check if a user has watched a video?
[11:31:01] <robertmaxrees> that's a huge question
[11:31:52] <reyley> bigger than a small question but smaller than a really really big question
[11:32:12] <NoiseEee> reyley: " Whenever the timer script on the episode page passes a significant amount of the video's total length (let's say 60%), then it POSTs to the reward route with the hash as a parameter. "
[11:32:27] <NoiseEee> ^^ why not generate the hash at that point
[11:33:40] <reyley> NoiseEee: how would the server side handler understand if the hash is valid then?
[11:34:19] <NoiseEee> well, generating something to go with the/tied to the hash
[11:34:46] <reyley> NoiseEee: can you give an example, i can't wrap my mind around that
[11:36:16] <NoiseEee> almost like a 2nd key to a locked door
[11:37:11] <reyley> NoiseEee: discrete example pls
[11:37:21] <NoiseEee> you load the first key when the video loads (your hash), then when it reaches 60%, you send a request to the backend that creates a 2nd hash based on the video hash and (server stored) userID or something
[11:38:06] <NoiseEee> then at 70% lets say, you can mark the video as "watched" because both keys/hashes are transmitted back to the server
[11:41:40] * NoiseEee shrugs
[11:41:44] <NoiseEee> just riffin' out loud
[11:41:46] <reyley> NoiseEee: so at 70%, another handler is posted to that checks if the episode in question has 2 separate hashes recorded and are connected to the user in question
[11:41:57] <NoiseEee> reyley: yah
[11:42:28] <reyley> hmmmm
[11:42:31] <NoiseEee> that'd work i think
[11:42:57] <reyley> this is hard to imagine as if i were a fraudster, since i already know how the system works
[11:43:53] <NoiseEee> i see the rub
[11:44:17] <reyley> wait a second
[11:44:19] <reyley> im retarded
[11:44:33] <reyley> oh wait no im not
[11:44:36] <reyley> not yet anyway
[11:44:51] <DjMadness> I've been trying to clean up and optimize my code as good as i can, but i am looking for some suggestions to further clean&optimize, could someone help ? my code is here http://jsbin.com/zopivitutu/edit?js
[11:45:52] <robertmaxrees> DjMadness use curlies.  abstract out code into functions to give names to logical units of work.
[11:46:07] <robertmaxrees> use .data() instead of .attr() for data attributes.
[11:46:38] <robertmaxrees> create fragments that you can then .clone() and edit later on.
[11:47:07] <DjMadness> sounds like some great suggestions, ill look into it, thank you very much :)
[11:47:38] <robertmaxrees> don't mix switch and if/else statements.
[11:48:59] <reyley> that moment when you mix switch and if/else
[11:49:53] <robertmaxrees> also, lines like $(this).after("<label for='" + id + "' id='#" + id + "_label'>" + labeltext + "</label>"); don't make much sense - IDs are just straight values in markup.
[11:49:59] <robertmaxrees> you don't format them like ID selectors.
[11:50:50] <happyface> how can I execute an arbitary-length array of functions that return promises in serial?
[11:51:39] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to get something like this to work: http://jsfiddle.net/vz9t907p/
[11:51:47] <robertmaxrees> myFunctionsArray.forEach(function(currentFunction) { currentFunction() /* this execues the function */ }); happyface
[11:51:58] <islalobo> I only want the popup to appear when the #edit-submitted-email-layout-email-fields-optinreceiveemails-1 isn't checked
[11:52:10] <islalobo> If it is checked, registration would happen as normal
[11:52:27] <happyface> robertmaxrees: that would execute them in parallel
[11:52:52] <robertmaxrees> happyface you need to serially execute them, then?
[11:53:01] <happyface> robertmaxrees: yeah exactly, using the promises
[11:53:21] <happyface> something like async.serial, but not using that
[11:53:40] <robertmaxrees> islalobo you want .prop('checked', false) for that checkbox
[11:53:59] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: even though it is a select option
[11:54:18] <Uhkis> why on earth would you do strict comparison on string 0
[11:54:35] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis you should always do strict comparison regardless.
[11:54:52] <robertmaxrees> islalobo that checkbox isn't a select.
[11:54:58] <robertmaxrees> it's a checkbox.
[11:55:15] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: okay, I'm trying: if ( $( "#edit-submitted-email-layout-email-fields-optinreceiveemails-1" ).prop('checked', false)) {
[11:55:24] <robertmaxrees> that sets the value
[11:55:33] <robertmaxrees> if ( !$( "#edit-submitted-email-layout-email-fields-optinreceiveemails-1" ).prop('checked')) {
[11:55:50] <DjMadness> robertmaxrees: thanks for the last point out, copy/paste mistake :) ill work on what you've told me :)
[11:58:10] <islalobo> robertmaxrees++
[11:58:19] <islalobo> Now on to the next issue!
[11:59:11] <robertmaxrees> happyface i think i'm missinmg what you're trying to accomplish, then.
[11:59:49] <robertmaxrees> are the functions in the array returning promise objects?
[12:00:24] <robertmaxrees> because you could manually build out a iterator that takes each one and calls it, then slaps a .done() that grabs the next index and repeats the whole thing.
[12:01:08] <Alina-malina> hello dear robert, can you please tell me how can i determine with jquery from what domain came the visitor and what domain its left from my website?
[12:01:31] <robertmaxrees> you don't use jquery for the first or second.  use google analytics for them instead.
[12:01:58] <Alina-malina> oh
[12:02:00] <Alina-malina> hmmm
[12:02:04] <Alina-malina> yes heh
[12:02:06] <robertmaxrees> fwiw, document.referrer is the referring domain
[12:02:10] <robertmaxrees> *link
[12:02:21] <Alina-malina> ah alrighty:) thanks
[12:02:29] <robertmaxrees> exit links are a whole different story.
[12:02:37] <Alina-malina> hmmm
[12:02:49] <Alina-malina> well i can determine when they leave, but i cant determine where they leave
[12:03:00] <robertmaxrees> what analytics suite are you using?
[12:03:00] <Alina-malina> i mean i know if they open another tab i cant see it
[12:03:11] <Alina-malina> i write it myself
[12:03:19] <Alina-malina> so i can track what does user click on my website
[12:03:20] <robertmaxrees> yeesh
[12:03:21] <Alina-malina> etc
[12:03:31] <robertmaxrees> use google analytics instead of rolling your own.
[12:03:54] <happyface> robertmaxrees: I have a list of functions that will return deferred objects if I execute them, but I want to execute them serially
[12:03:58] <Alina-malina> ok thanks
[12:04:28] <robertmaxrees> happyface yeah, then do what i said earlier.  it'll be a sort-of-recursive thing.
[12:05:53] <happyface> robertmaxrees: yeah that makes sense. I was wondering if there was some magic that would help me with that. Thanks!

[12:34:35] <TeddyMurray> hi in jquery ui, how can i make the tab close when the tab is pressed twice?
[12:36:01] <reyley> TeddyMurray: apply a dblclick() function handler
[12:36:10] <reyley> http://api.jquery.com/dblclick/
[12:36:10] <TeddyMurray> sweet thank you reyley
[12:36:28] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, check to see if the current tab is opened and close it if it is.
[12:36:38] <robertmaxrees> that'll be far less implicit.
[12:36:56] <TeddyMurray> makes sense
[12:43:11] <MikeD_> can I do this without pushing the promises into the xact array?  http://jsfiddle.net/1kcLfje5/1/
[12:44:14] <MikeD_> ... replace $.each() with $.map(), return the promise inside the map function and feed that to the when.apply()?
[12:49:35] <shoky> MikeD_: yep
[12:52:21] <marko_> Hi when i use .one() is there a way to reset this when i click on a other element to make the first clicked element clickable again?
[12:52:39] <robertmaxrees> why not just use .on() and use conditionals around the callback?
[12:53:14] <cannap> lazy^^
[12:53:31] <robertmaxrees> it's a lot easier than juggling bindings.
[12:54:35] <cannap> ok
[12:54:37] <cannap> i will change thx
[12:54:42] <MikeD_> heh, now all i have to do is make this fit into my real application:  http://jsfiddle.net/1kcLfje5/2/
[12:55:02] <cannap> fuck why i can many times double click on a element and then send the ajax request and php is to slow to handle this or what i dont know oO
[12:55:26] <cannap> i set a cookie to prevent doubleclick form the same element i need this cookie yes ^^
[12:55:37] <cannap> but i think php is slower as my doubleclick or so
[12:55:48] <MikeD_> doubleclick is usually a bad idea
[12:56:04] <cannap> na i dont use doubleclick but i make a double i see many 10 then goes to 12
[12:56:05] <arthurvr> indeed, and why not to handle the prevention client-side (too)?
[12:56:13] <cannap> yep i disable the button
[12:56:17] <cannap> for a five seconds
[12:56:17] <MikeD_> we've spent years teaching people to click links and double-click icons on the desktop  :p
[12:56:39] <cannap> i make a simple click but when i double php is slower and the request comes in or so
[12:56:40] <MikeD_> (still not everyone gets it)
[12:56:40] <robertmaxrees> cannap disable the button until the ajax request comes back.
[12:56:46] <cannap> yep
[12:56:53] <cannap> sry my english sucks
[12:57:24] <t0astt> I realize this may not be the appropriate channel for this question, but does anyone know of any slick modal libraries/plugins? I'm planning on adding some input fields and other elements to it, and having callback functions would be nice as well.
[12:57:37] <robertmaxrees> i like jqmodal, t0astt
[12:58:00] <cannap> http://cl.ly/image/2w2N3h1e2i1e working on this you see you can click one of the reaction you have after reading
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> disable after a single click then.
[12:58:33] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'd do.
[12:58:43] <cannap> but you cant click the same thing two times but you can click another thing but many time when i fast hit the mouse its makes +2 php is to slow or my internet dont know i prevent double click by disable the button
[12:58:46] <t0astt> robertmaxrees: not bad, but do you know of anything a little more styled? Otherwise I can just try styling jqmodal, but I'd prefer not to :P
[12:59:01] <robertmaxrees> t0astt i'd just style it to suit your needs.
[12:59:27] <robertmaxrees> cannap no clue.
[12:59:49] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a PHP or other issue.
[12:59:56] <cannap> yep to slow or so^^
[13:00:02] <robertmaxrees> you could queue up your ajax requests and fire them one at a time.
[13:00:03] <cannap> the cookie needs more time to set as i click
[13:00:11] <robertmaxrees> why are you setting a cookie?
[13:00:36] <cannap> ip block or what?
[13:00:46] <cannap> i know this is the wrong channel for this
[13:00:48] <robertmaxrees> what purpose does the cookie server?
[13:00:49] <robertmaxrees> *serve
[13:00:57] <cannap> this cookie check what you clicked
[13:01:06] <cannap> and you cant increase the same thing
[13:01:12] <robertmaxrees> control that server-side.
[13:01:19] <robertmaxrees> and use sessions.
[13:01:44] <cannap> i can sessions delete to
[13:01:51] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:02:08] <cannap> cookie is not safe for spamming session is not save for spamming
[13:02:17] <cannap> should i use the ip or what
[13:02:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:02:33] <cannap> i want to prevent user cant spam the button^^
[13:02:33] <robertmaxrees> tie these things to the user account.
[13:02:41] <cannap> not for loggedin users
[13:02:45] <cannap> for all users
[13:02:54] <robertmaxrees> require a login.
[13:03:04] <cannap> its a wordpress plugin
[13:03:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you don't really have any way of preventing the spam.
[13:03:19] <cannap> yep i know the best thing i see a fucking simple cookie^^
[13:03:31] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:03:50] <cannap> i checket out 100 of scripts and they worked all with cookies
[13:04:11] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use cookies for something like this, but you seem to have made up your mind.
[13:04:26] <arthurvr> Iâ€™m +1 on no cookies :)
[13:04:39] <cannap> i need to save this?
[13:04:44] <cannap> per ip or what
[13:05:04] <cannap> what is a shool behind a NAS?
[13:05:15] <cannap> i block them all to vote this things
[13:05:24] <robertmaxrees> you really need to support user accounts.
[13:05:25] <cannap> when a other voted from this tip
[13:05:38] <cannap> nooo
[13:05:50] <cannap> this will not work tell me some blog you read who you need a user account?
[13:06:01] <cannap> smashingmagazin no?
[13:06:13] <cannap> i dont want user to force login to vote this is not my goal :/
[13:06:21] <robertmaxrees> you want more like buzzfeed style functionality.
[13:06:47] <arthurvr> localstorage?
[13:06:55] <robertmaxrees> i can still nuke that,.
[13:07:40] <cannap> we can send ajax request without
[13:07:41] <cannap> js
[13:07:47] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:07:53] <cannap> why not?
[13:07:54] <robertmaxrees> needs js.
[13:07:56] <arthurvr> ajax requests without js? something special
[13:08:00] <robertmaxrees> Asyncronous Javascript and XML
[13:08:01] <cannap> ehz
[13:08:03] <cannap>  i mean post
[13:08:29] <cannap> yes so this is not the right place for this^^
[13:08:37] <cannap> thx i will fix some things now
[13:11:31] <cannap> i will make a small ip block when user spam faster as he can delete cookies by self^^
[13:17:39] <DjMadness> robertmaxrees: i've cleaned up things a bit, however i cannot figgure out what you mean with .clone() and putting it into functions, as there is not much thats being reused.  my cleaned up code is here http://jsbin.com/wohakirego/1/edit?js if your interested in further assistance.
[13:17:40] <robertmaxrees> that'll block schools and apoartments and stuff fwiw
[13:18:38] <robertmaxrees> DjMadness just because you only use something once doesn't mean you shouldn't abstract it out to give it a name.,
[13:19:02] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[13:40:49] <DjMadness> robertmaxrees: have a nice lunch :)
[13:59:17] <Sal> hi
[14:00:55] <Sal> does anyone know how to avoid a scroll event when you call an animate scrollTop?
[14:04:01] <BillCriswell> Sal: I don't think animate triggers scroll events?
[14:04:19] <Sal> it does :(
[14:04:37] <Sal> i put a break on it, and it enters the listener function
[14:05:58] <Sal> they opened a ticket for it: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14820
[14:06:05] <Sal> but it doesn't depend on jquery
[14:06:11] <Sal> its a browser problem
[14:06:23] <BillCriswell> Sal: The only thing I could think to do is set a variable when you start the animation.
[14:06:39] <Sal> i'm doind tha  now
[14:07:06] <Sal> but whn animation ends, the variable gets reset
[14:07:11] <Sal> and then the scroll events fires
[14:09:42] <BillCriswell> Hmm..
[14:10:36] <BillCriswell> That's weird.
[14:11:59] <Sal> i also tried to check the top position, and reset the flag only when top=0
[14:12:20] <Sal> but there's always a last scroll fired that mess up everything
[14:12:21] <Sal> damn
[14:13:33] <BillCriswell> That is annoying.
[14:14:58] <BillCriswell> Sal: I have to run, but here goes my test case in case it's useful for getting help: http://jsbin.com/rodifa/1/edit?html,js,output
[14:15:35] <BillCriswell> Good luck.
[14:15:37] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/Salc/ru9ywzc2/1/embedded/result/
[14:15:44] <Sal> here's the sample
[14:15:49] <Sal> ok, sorry, thanks
[14:15:51] <Sal> bye
[14:36:47] <Sal> does anyone have a solution for this: http://jsfiddle.net/Salc/ru9ywzc2/2/embedded/result/
[14:45:48] <reyley> wait
[14:45:57] <reyley> why should user scroll not fire
[14:46:28] <reyley> Sal
[14:49:05] <Sal_> damnl,
[14:49:10] <Sal_> can't get my nick back
[14:49:23] <Sal_> anyway, anyone while i was away?
[14:49:30] <Sal_> http://jsfiddle.net/Salc/ru9ywzc2/2/
[14:50:37] <Sal_> reyley, because anymation is complete.
[14:51:00] <Sal_> i switch back off the flag, and scroll gires for the last time
[14:51:08] <Sal_> gires=fires
[14:52:22] <reyley> if you want your nick back, you'll have to close your client and reopen
[14:52:35] <reyley> but anyway i will look at this again
[14:53:16] <Sal_> you have to leave?
[14:53:48] <reyley> pardon my confusion, but what is being locked exactly?
[14:54:02] <Sal_> actually, nothing
[14:54:04] <Sal_> hehehe
[14:54:28] <Sal_> it was a flag that i inserted to try to avoid the last scroll event
[14:54:28] <reyley> it looks like you're using it as a differentiator between user scrolling and automatic scrolling
[14:54:40] <Sal_> yes
[14:55:03] <Sal_> its because i don't want the animate scrollTop to file the scroll event
[14:55:11] <Sal_> and it works, while animation is in progress
[14:55:37] <Sal_> but when animation finis, it fires again scroll
[14:55:45] <Sal_> and i don't know how to stop it
[14:56:17] <reyley> this is strange
[14:56:18] <Sal_> it should never go to line 14
[14:56:39] <Sal_> it sholed reset the lock to false and stop
[14:56:43] <Sal_> yes
[14:57:16] <Sal_> maybe i shoudl use a flag with 3 values
[14:57:21] <Sal_> let me try
[14:57:50] <reyley> see what i think is happening is the function you supplied as a parameter to animate occurs while the animation is happening
[14:58:56] <reyley> im going to try something
[15:01:04] <reyley> Sal
[15:01:09] <reyley> have you seen this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19445553/scroll-fires-after-jquery-scrolltop-animate-completed
[15:01:23] <Sal_> yep
[15:01:29] <Sal_> this is my solution: http://jsfiddle.net/Salc/ru9ywzc2/4/
[15:02:45] <reyley> a triple conditional
[15:02:57] <reyley> ok fine
[15:03:09] <Sal_> yes, its the only way
[15:03:25] <Sal_> now, i have to see if all browser fire the last scroll
[15:03:26] <Sal_> hehehe
[15:03:48] <Sal_> anyway, it should work the same
[15:34:54] <jeffreylevesque> is there a nice way to convert a file to a jquery object?
[15:34:59] <jeffreylevesque> for example, http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson
[15:35:47] <cjohnson> what does that mean jeffreylevesque
[15:35:56] <jeffreylevesque> i want to parse that file
[15:36:01] <cjohnson> your link responds nothing for me
[15:36:24] <cjohnson> I don't see how parsing a JSON file really relates to a jquery object though
[15:36:29] <jeffreylevesque> cjohnson: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeff1evesque/geolocation-js/master/data/all_month.geojson
[15:36:37] <cjohnson> ok
[15:36:55] <cjohnson> you can make an ajax request to the file and JSON.parse it and treat it like a standard object
[15:37:17] <jeffreylevesque> so standard $.ajax() object with the url being the file?
[15:37:48] <cjohnson> yep
[15:38:11] <jeffreylevesque> thank you sir
[15:39:24] <cjohnson> I'm not sure this is technically valid JSON, might need to wrap [ and ] around it or see if there's some extra lib needed for this "geojson" format
[15:40:21] <cjohnson> the file is huge also. you might want to set up some sort of middleman server to pare it down and clean it up into valid JSON
[17:44:38] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know how i can make my ajax a 'cors' request
[17:44:55] <jeffreylevesque> I am receiving 'Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.'
[17:45:51] <robertmaxrees> the server has to allow it.
[17:46:49] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: can i just define an htaccess with a rule?
[17:47:03] <robertmaxrees> do you own the server a usgs.gov?
[17:47:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:47:07] <robertmaxrees> that's the one that matters
[17:47:25] <jeffreylevesque> no, i don't own their server
[17:47:29] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[17:47:31] <jeffreylevesque> i just have a virtual machine
[17:47:39] <jeffreylevesque> and trying to scrape data from their server
[17:47:47] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that the way you want.
[17:48:33] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: is there anyway I can scrape their data?
[17:48:41] <robertmaxrees> use phantomjs on your box
[17:50:21] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: if i use phantomjs, will that change my existing `$.ajax()`?
[17:51:07] <jeffreylevesque> https://github.com/jeff1evesque/geolocation-js/commit/9ca7cd9e9f104c98464d82b6cb0029d97f7a84c9
[17:51:49] <robertmaxrees> you cannot use $.ajax() do to this.
[17:52:00] <robertmaxrees> well, you cannot use $.ajax() to hit the other server.
[17:52:08] <robertmaxrees> because they do not allow you to.
[17:52:08] <jeffreylevesque> ok
[17:52:13] <jeffreylevesque> it makes sense
[17:52:16] <jeffreylevesque> this is pretty nifty
[17:52:29] <jeffreylevesque> http://techslides.com/grabbing-html-source-code-with-phantomjs-or-casperjs
[17:53:52] <robertmaxrees> the idea is you use $.ajax() to hit your own box, which does the request to scrape the data and returns it back to the browser.
[17:53:54] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[17:54:00] <jeffreylevesque> yes sir
[17:54:05] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: thank you
[17:54:31] <robertmaxrees> though in this case you don't even need phantomjs.
[17:54:35] <robertmaxrees> you could use curl or something else.
[18:25:57] <baako> hi guys is it possible to use jquery to get something from server? I am not passing anything to it just receiving a response
[18:26:11] <SirLagz> baako: yes. $.get
[18:30:19] <baako> SirLagz: http://kopy.io/861vc not response
[18:30:31] <baako> i have even try alert("hello");
[18:32:17] <SirLagz> baako: try using an absolute path to the file rather than relative
[18:32:38] <SirLagz> just to make sure it works
[18:32:46] <baako> SirLagz: i am using a framework
[18:32:52] <baako> pgp
[18:32:53] <baako> php
[18:33:11] <SirLagz> baako: that doesn't change what I just said
[18:33:32] <baako> SirLagz: that is what i am going be using when i move from server to servers
[18:33:59] <SirLagz> baako: yes, but for now, test it with an absolute path
[18:34:31] <baako> SirLagz: thats the url
[18:34:48] <baako> u mean the filepath?
[18:34:54] <SirLagz> baako: that's a path. a url is "http://www.example.com/path"
[18:36:05] <baako> am tell you SirLagz $.get('{{ URL::route("approval-list")}}', function(data) {
[18:36:06] <baako> $.get('http://project.local/approval', function(data) {
[18:36:25] <SirLagz> what ?
[18:36:34] <baako>  $.get('http://project.local/approval', function(data) { SirLagz
[18:36:40] <baako> se that is the url
[18:36:57] <baako> i have test it out without jquery
[18:37:10] <baako> and it returns the response
[18:37:25] <SirLagz> ok...
[18:39:44] <baako> SirLagz: might need to do somethings first
[18:41:57] <baako> SirLagz: got it. my loop didnt close
[18:43:33] <baako> SirLagz: what i am trying to do is. when new records are getting inserted into the database. I want to use jquery to get those record or records without having to refresh the page
[18:43:43] <baako> can $.get work like that?
[18:44:39] <SirLagz> baako: yes
[18:44:43] <baako> thanks
[18:55:24] <baako> SirLagz: how do you do a foreach loop over (data)? in $.get ?
[18:56:22] <baako> http://kopy.io/FGwON
[19:01:47] <baako> i have tried http://kopy.io/roskz but it ain't work and no error
[19:03:57] <jeffreylevesque> trying to install phantomjs
[19:04:00] <SirLagz> baako: with $.each
[19:04:19] <jeffreylevesque> should i put the linux binary into a special linux (ubuntu) directory when i untar it?
[19:04:29] <baako> SirLagz: please look at  http://kopy.io/roskz
[19:05:02] <baako> it aint working and no error
[19:06:32] <SirLagz> baako: where is that URL::ROute from ? A php library or javascript library ?
[19:07:02] <baako> SirLagz: laravel
[19:07:20] <baako> its working but i want to loop over the record
[19:08:17] <baako> SirLagz: http://kopy.io/n8Cmo alerts the reponses
[19:08:22] <baako> responses
[19:08:31] <SirLagz> baako: and you're getting something in the response ?
[19:08:53] <baako> but what i want to do now is loop over the responses http://kopy.io/roskz
[19:09:15] <baako> but http://kopy.io/roskz doesn't loop over it
[19:10:07] <SirLagz> baako: what format is the response in ? JSON ?
[19:10:48] <baako> SirLagz: nope just strings as i am doing echo $products->id with php
[19:10:53] <baako> so its just strings
[19:11:34] <SirLagz> baako: well jQuery won't know when the start/end of each element is to loop over it...you could output it in JSON, then in the jquery get it to parse the JSON to loop over it
[19:12:58] <baako> hmm
[19:19:34] <baako> SirLagz: i got it to turn it as json
[19:19:46] <baako> how do i get jquery to get values?
[19:22:52] <baako> think i got it
[19:31:46] <baako> SirLagz: r u still around?
[19:32:33] <SirLagz> baako: yes, just working.
[19:33:49] <baako> i have over 30 records in my json but http://kopy.io/UWGen is only showing 1 of them
[19:33:58] <baako> any ideas what i am missing?
[19:35:04] <baako> fixed it
[19:35:09] <SirLagz> kk
[19:37:44] <baako> SirLagz: i have one more thing to ask please. i have just deleted some records from my database. why isn't $.get updating my page? i dont want to refresh the page for this
[19:37:58] <baako> i want it to update automatically is that possible?
[19:47:47] <SirLagz> baako: are you running the $.get again ?
[19:48:09] <baako> SirLagz: yes
[19:48:50] <SirLagz> baako: are you clearing out the table before appending to it again ?
[19:49:49] <baako> SirLagz: i want to check that i do not display the same data turn by the response.
[19:50:02] <baako> wait
[19:50:29] <baako> i want to check that i am not displaying the same data which is already in the <div class="col-md-1"></div>
[19:50:52] <SirLagz> baako: why ? If you want to display new data, just clear out the divs and append to them again
[19:50:53] <baako> and only display the one that is not in that list
[19:51:16] <SirLagz> baako: that would take some extra logic
[19:51:24] <baako> SirLagz: I do not want to clear out the old data because the user needs to do something with that old data
[19:52:43] <baako> i did this http://kopy.io/69qem but it keep displaying the same thing over and over which i do not want
[19:53:23] <baako> will that be possible
[19:53:38] <SirLagz> baako: I'm sure it would be possible...
[19:54:10] <Getty> Here, have some good music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJkYgBKZ0Ao
[19:56:37] <baako> SirLagz: any ideas?
[19:57:13] <SirLagz> baako: give everything a unique id, and compare unique ids when you get the new set of data, remove anything that matches in the new set of data.
[20:09:25] <Syl> Hello
[20:09:54] <Syl> I'm stumbling over a very simple concept in jquery and I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction
[20:10:34] <Syl> Anyone have a moment to spare for a question?
[20:10:44] <tw2113> just ask the question :P
[20:11:41] <Syl> I am loading a page with a single checkbox.  <input type="checkbox" name="checkbox1" id="chk1" value="true" checked="true">Test 1
[20:12:14] <Syl> When the page loads, I want to write something in jquery that will check the state of #chk1, and if its checked, it will alert "this is checked"
[20:12:46] <Syl> basically, on page load, if chk1 is checked, alert("this is checked")
[20:12:51] <Syl> I can't figure out how to do it in jquery
[20:14:23] <Syl> Any ideas?
[20:16:50] <tw2113> if ( $('#chk1').prop('checked', function(){ alert('This is checked'); });
[20:16:53] <tw2113> off of memory alone
[20:16:58] <tw2113> i haven't done much js lately
[20:19:02] <Syl> It ain't working. Here is a simple jsfiddle for it: http://jsfiddle.net/c6sq3sev/
[20:20:05] <Syl> ah, got it.  Needed another (
[20:20:21] <jeffreylevesque> i'm using phantomjs.  console says 'ReferenceError: require is not defined' when I attempt 'var page = require('webpage').create();'
[20:20:43] <jeffreylevesque> i have phantomjs 1.9.0 installed
[20:20:48] <jeffreylevesque> fairly new
[20:21:03] <tw2113> there is also if ( $( '#chk1' ).is( ":checked" ) ) {}
[20:27:17] <baako> i have 3 variables i want to put them into 1 variable how do i do that?
[20:27:42] <baako> is it var other = variable1, variable2, variable3; ?
[20:27:59] <beefkitten> baako: first lol, second, what types of variables are they
[20:28:07] <Syl> if ( $('#chk1').prop('checked', function(){ alert('This is checked'); }));    will fire the alert no matter what.  Not sure why
[20:28:37] <beefkitten> baako: make an array?
[20:28:51] <baako> beefkitten: http://kopy.io/8yKPa
[20:29:15] <baako> it will be accept, tableNo, denied
[20:29:26] <tw2113> Syl, i was probably wrong somewhere
[20:29:33] <tw2113> check the docs for the prop() function
[20:29:47] <Syl> i'm checking, not sure why i'm getting tripped up.  Thanks for trying though
[20:30:45] <beefkitten> baako: why do you want this to be one variable
[20:31:17] <baako> beefkitten: <button> somevalue <button>
[20:31:41] <baako> beefkitten: <accept> tableNo <denied>
[20:32:13] <baako> beefkitten: unless they is a better way of doing it
[20:34:42] <beefkitten> baako: you want to output these on a page as one string?
[20:35:41] <baako> beefkitten: thats the idea
[20:37:26] <beefkitten> baako: cool, for accept && dennied - var other = accept + denied;
[20:39:09] <beefkitten> baako: I'm not sure what you're doing with tableNo, but you can't concatenate that to other. You're using the selector in tableNo inccorectly, and .html inject the contents into the selected elem
[20:39:19] <jeffreylevesque> anyone use phantomjs?
[20:39:49] <baako> beefkitten: hmm
[20:39:51] <baako> thanks
[20:40:55] <beefkitten> baako: Do you know what you're trying to do with tableNo?
[20:41:28] <baako> beefkitten: i just want to display it in the middle of those 2 buttons
[20:41:54] <aro> has anyone used wysihtml5? i am having problems with a custom toolbar
[20:42:56] <baako> beefkitten: this is how it is now http://kopy.io/3sUU4
[20:43:30] <baako> i dont need that .html
[20:43:39] <beefkitten> '<div class="col-md-1"></div>'
[20:43:44] <beefkitten> is that all you want in between the buttons?
[20:44:51] <baako> i want tableNo to be in that class
[20:45:06] <baako> doesnt need to be in div but with any element that accepts class
[20:45:24] <baako> due to color
[20:45:30] <beefkitten> So you want something in between the buttons with 'data[index].table_no' as the elem's class?
[20:47:26] <cram> $(this).closest("li").remove(); with the help of this how can i know which li is remove
[20:47:42] <cram> Object[li#0]
[20:47:52] <cram> it's return something like this
[20:48:00] <cram> i need li id value
[20:48:49] <beefkitten> cram: just depends what $(this) is
[20:49:12] <baako> beefkitten: yep
[20:54:31] <beefkitten> baako: http://jsfiddle.net/ptyq5w1a/1/
[20:54:33] <beefkitten> ??
[20:55:29] <baako> beefkitten: not really but i get the idea now
[21:00:07] <w1z> j #ios-development
[21:00:10] <w1z> -_-
[21:00:43] <w1z> which isn't really
[21:19:07] <jeffreylevesque> anyone familiar with phantomjs
[21:19:12] <baako> hi guys why isn't http://kopy.io/QWimL looping? it loops but it only shows 1 records and i have over 40 of them
[21:24:33] <Dreamstiffler> Hi guys. Im new to drupal and jquery. I have set via ui in the drupal to use jquery 1.7. Because if i use newer versions some of my module functions wont work. So heres my problem. Im trying to add a jquery script to my form. So i searched around and found out that i can put it in the js file and call in in the themes .info file. Thing is if i use like .prop it gives me an error. So i tried changing it to .attr..no more error 
[21:25:03] <Dreamstiffler> What I want to do is basically like this http://jsfiddle.net/JpwPk/8/
[21:25:29] <Dreamstiffler> the checkbox resets on select list
[21:29:15] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Have you listened to Devo Hardcore Volume 1 and 2?
[21:30:30] <tw2113> Whip It Gooder?
[21:30:55] <BillCriswell> tw2113: This stuff is SO different from Whip It.
[21:31:11] <BillCriswell> but it's awesome.
[21:31:27] <BillCriswell> It's old recording from like 74-75.
[21:31:28] <tw2113> better than their cover of Satisfaction?
[21:32:11] <tw2113> i don't know much about the band other than the common knowledge stuff
[21:32:25] <BillCriswell> I really like it, but it's weird haha.
[21:32:53] <tw2113> given the band, i'd hope so
[21:33:08] <BillCriswell> Otis Redding does my favorite version of Satisfaction though haha
[21:33:28] <tw2113> any band that names a song Jocko Homo, is alright in my books
[21:33:33] <BillCriswell> Haha
[21:34:11] <BillCriswell> The song subjects in the hardcore ones are borderline offensive haha
[21:34:38] <tw2113> can't forget "Mongoloid" either
[21:35:58] <BillCriswell> Haha yes, all good tunes.
[21:36:12] <jeffreylevesque> trying to use phantomjs, but browser console says 'ReferenceError: require is not defined'
[21:36:13] <BillCriswell> this is a pretty different flavor of devo.
[21:36:50] <jeffreylevesque> `var page = require('webpage').create();` is the cause
[21:36:59] <jeffreylevesque> but, specifics - not sure
[21:37:48] <jeffreylevesque> `phantomjs -v` says i have 1.9.0 installed
[21:38:19] <jeffreylevesque> `whereis phantomjs` says 'phantomjs: /usr/bin/phantomjs /usr/lib/phantomjs /usr/bin/X11/phantomjs'
[21:38:34] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: Are you actually trying o run this in the browser?
[21:38:47] <BillCriswell> tw2113: I'm currently really digging this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h1V29LUCv4
[21:38:50] <reyley> ahhh phantomjs
[21:39:16] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: yes sir
[21:39:31] <tw2113> isn't phantomjs supposed to be headless?
[21:39:40] <reyley> this guys tried stopping me from scraping his site by passing obfuscated data from server side to js
[21:39:51] <reyley> i used phantomjs to fuck him over
[21:39:57] <reyley> i dont regret anything
[21:40:06] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: You'd run that on the command line, not in the browser.
[21:40:09] <reyley> how dare he try to stop me
[21:40:26] <tw2113> how dare he try to stop you from scraping his content?
[21:40:35] <reyley> yes
[21:40:56] <tw2113> doesn't he technically have the copyright to it?
[21:41:06] <reyley> no it was an illegal video site
[21:41:12] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: is there any tools that I could do via a jquery, not command line?
[21:41:15] <tw2113> so neither of you had copyrights
[21:41:25] <reyley> yea but he called me a thief
[21:41:28] <reyley> that hypocrite
[21:41:43] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: What are you trying to do with it?
[21:41:54] <jeffreylevesque> parse geojson content
[21:42:08] <jeffreylevesque> specifically, earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson
[21:42:10] <rangergord> does anyone here use Fancytree?
[21:42:16] <tw2113> BillCriswell, pick one: 1, 2, or 3
[21:42:24] <reyley> jeffreylevesque: you can load phantomjs as a node extension
[21:42:35] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Is this a trick question? lol
[21:42:39] <BillCriswell> I'll go with 2 though.
[21:42:41] <tw2113> no
[21:43:00] <BillCriswell> Oh... I think I missed the question then.
[21:43:05] <jeffreylevesque> so, i can't use phantomjs as code in my js file?
[21:43:09] <tw2113> no, i never said a specific question
[21:43:19] <BillCriswell> tw2113: lol oh.
[21:43:20] <rangergord> reyley: how'd you fuck him over?
[21:43:22] <BillCriswell> Ok then, 2.
[21:43:29] <tw2113> bp-groups it is the
[21:43:29] <tw2113> n
[21:44:08] <BillCriswell> tw2113: I have no idea what's going on lol
[21:44:22] <jeffreylevesque> the examples - http://techslides.com/grabbing-html-source-code-with-phantomjs-or-casperjs
[21:44:26] <reyley> rangergord: render his page with phantom so the js is executed and then pass the contents to an app
[21:44:29] <jeffreylevesque> seem to suggest that you can
[21:45:13] <rangergord> reyley: but how did you fuck him over, exactly? I'm not a web developer, so all I got from it is "I wanted data from his site, he obfuscated it, I was able to get it anyway".
[21:45:23] <rangergord> fucking over means something bad happened to him
[21:45:36] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: This would be done on the server though. Then your client side js would need to grab it from that.
[21:45:45] <rangergord> not trying to belittle your achievement
[21:46:15] <reyley> well his site crashed a couple of times from all the traffic i was sending him
[21:47:32] <rangergord> well that's his fault then. should be rate-limiting IPs.
[21:48:33] <reyley> oh no it wasnt just me, it was all my users
[21:49:10] <rangergord> oh, you were embedding his videos on your own site?
[21:50:00] <reyley> no its like
[21:50:35] <reyley> on his website you click a series, then an episode from a list, and then you watch the episode
[21:50:48] <reyley> he obfuscated the list of episodes
[21:51:23] <reyley> but the total traffic from my (android, not web) app was the problem for him
[21:52:07] <rangergord> oh i see
[21:53:14] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/master/examples/pizza.js
[21:53:42] <jeffreylevesque> it's client side, it seems
[21:54:12] <reyley> jeffreylevesque: thats server side
[21:54:21] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: You'd request this from file from the client side and your server runs that file.
[21:54:34] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: With what you're doing it's actually much simpler.
[21:55:10] <jeffreylevesque> isn't that like any ordinary js file?
[21:55:30] <BillCriswell> Yes, but it runs on the server.
[21:55:57] <jeffreylevesque> all i need is a <script> tag with src = that file?
[21:56:07] <jeffreylevesque> then, phantomjs file runs on the server?
[21:56:12] <reyley> no
[21:56:23] <reyley> what are you trying to do
[21:56:39] <jeffreylevesque> i want to parse this document using phantomjs - http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson
[21:57:01] <jeffreylevesque> be able to scrape the content of that file
[21:57:07] <jeffreylevesque> the source code is identical
[21:57:09] <reyley> do you have ssh credentials for the server where you will run phantomjs
[21:57:28] <jeffreylevesque> i could - but, seems too complicated
[21:57:50] <baako> i have some unique values in a div with class table_id
[21:58:24] <reyley> you have to either set up a cgi interface with phantom or you can load it as a node extension and use the node cgi module
[21:58:42] <jeffreylevesque> maybe node extension is easier
[21:58:46] <reyley> and then you can insert data into a webpage like the way you want
[21:58:50] <baako> how can i get those values in the div and check it with var thisid = data[index].id
[21:59:01] <rangergord> dammit, I give up...anyone here use Fancytree? Has anyone here even heard of it?
[21:59:20] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: Is your server running php already?
[21:59:39] <jeffreylevesque> it has it - but, i'm trying to do everything in jquery without php
[21:59:56] <Uhkis> why?
[22:00:08] <jeffreylevesque> bc my next goal is to do it via python
[22:00:57] <Uhkis> so do it in python? :D
[22:01:12] <reyley> Uhkis: i think hes trying to learn multiple languages
[22:01:25] <reyley> so hes practicing the same problems in various languages
[22:01:28] <BillCriswell> I would have to google to do it in python, but in php I could definitely help quickly.
[22:01:32] <Uhkis> oh
[22:01:47] <jeffreylevesque> i could probably use curl in php
[22:01:51] <reyley> wait a second....
[22:01:52] <jeffreylevesque> but, i'm avoiding php
[22:02:01] <Uhkis> file_get_contents('url'); done
[22:02:05] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: So you're just doing this for fun?
[22:02:09] <reyley> this webpage has no js at all
[22:02:17] <reyley> why do you need phantom?
[22:02:57] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: and the right http headers, but yeah haha
[22:03:05] <Uhkis> reyley: cors probably
[22:03:20] <reyley> thats only for post requests though
[22:03:22] <reyley> i think
[22:03:28] <jeffreylevesque> so where would i put this js file - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20173928/how-to-get-the-html-source-of-a-website-with-phantomjs
[22:03:36] <jeffreylevesque> seems simple
[22:03:52] <jeffreylevesque> short
[22:05:10] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: It would be on a server that you can request from.
[22:06:18] <baako> Hi, i just need advise on how to get a value in a div class called table_id(they will be more than 2 div with that id), check that it is a number, then compare it with the uniqueID var and then only render those that does not exist in the table_id class.  )
[22:06:21] <BillCriswell> Oh, now I see why this is kind of confusing.
[22:06:26] <baako> this is what i have so far http://kopy.io/HOJ3t
[22:09:45] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: Basically, js would be acting as like php or python with that script you're running and a regular client side js file would be requesting that file (which would just return the json for you).
[22:10:20] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: yea, so i would just need to add a <script> file pointing to the phantomjs?
[22:10:53] <BillCriswell> If that phantomjs file is parsed serverside yes.
[22:11:49] <reyley> i dont think that will work because the script tag implies a client side context
[22:11:59] <reyley> the browsers not going to understand the phantomjs code
[22:12:38] <jeffreylevesque> i got it working on the command line
[22:12:41] <BillCriswell> The browser wouldn't see the server side js.
[22:12:53] <BillCriswell> It would just see what it outputs (maybe)?
[22:13:13] <jeffreylevesque> that would be cool!
[22:14:03] <BillCriswell> I'd need to mess around with it a bit more to understand better.
[22:14:36] <reyley> jeffreylevesque: did you get it working, because i just spun up a server for you
[22:14:37] <jeffreylevesque> at least i know now that i have to run it on the serverside
[22:14:46] <jeffreylevesque> just, have to figure out how to return it to the clientside js
[22:15:27] <jeffreylevesque> not yet
[22:15:31] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: if you do $.getJSON('get-geojson.php', function (json) { console.log(json); }); and in get-geojson.php you have <?php echo file_get_contents('http://geojson.whatever'); it'll work.
[22:17:37] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: phantom is way overkill for your task though.
[22:17:50] <BillCriswell> something like this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/request
[22:18:01] <BillCriswell> or just nodes http.get() would be plenty.
[22:18:28] <reyley> yea you dont need phantom for this, theres no benefit
[22:20:26] <BillCriswell> ok computer is about to die. night.
[22:20:32] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: goodnight
[22:21:33] <rangergord> goodnight sweet prince
[22:21:54] <rangergord> i dont even get that reference, im just repeating it. does Hamlet die at the end?
[22:22:31] <reyley> if only i paid attention in english
[22:22:48] <reyley> if only i actually went to english, now that i think about it
[22:23:33] <rangergord> I wish I'd gone in some BS liberal arts major like literature. I used to love writing, now I feel like a drone. My education has completely killed my creativity.
[22:23:48] <rangergord> either that, or video games
[22:24:06] <reyley> yea i was reading jeff atwoods blog
[22:24:14] <reyley> the cofounder of stackoverflow
[22:24:28] <reyley> he chose cs as his minor cause he didnt want to deal with math and shit
[22:25:24] <rangergord> so what'd he major in?
[22:25:31] <rangergord> dont say business
[22:25:39] <reyley> something to do with the environment lol
[22:25:43] <reyley> hold on lemme check
[22:29:13] <rangergord> dont worry about it
[22:29:43] <rangergord> http://www.inc.com/uploaded_files/image/2009-CJS-Spolsky-pop_755.jpg
[22:29:49] <reyley> yea i cant find the article where he showed his transcript
[22:30:02] <rangergord> allright dude, it's just you and me here
[22:30:19] <rangergord> can you spare 5 mins to help me with what I've been trying to do for over an hour?
[22:30:42] <reyley> alright lets see if my sleep deprived mind can handle it
[22:30:47] <reyley> what is it
[22:33:09] <rangergord> ok, basically im a frontend novice. Like, at all levels (HTML/CSS/JS) I know only the basics. I'm using a jquery-based lib called fancytree to show a table. Looks like this: http://wwwendt.de/tech/fancytree/demo/index.html#sample-theming.html    Now I'm trying to figure out how to change the icon, like on that page. I can't figure it out.
[22:34:06] <reyley> first thing i would do is check the source code
[22:34:12] <rangergord> I've tried various things, such as setting a renderNode callback (would cause an error I couldnt get out of), setting node.data.icon (turns out it's for fancytree 1). last thing i tried is setting a class name, andu sing CSS, but that did nothing
[22:34:51] <reyley> can you post the stuff in a jsfiddle so i can see
[22:35:11] <rangergord> literally the only place I've even seen this lib mentioned in (I didnt pick it), is a single google groups thread with a guy asking the same question
[22:36:11] <rangergord> k. but i'll need some time to figure out how to put it on jsfiddle.
[22:36:32] <reyley> damn it
[22:36:48] <reyley> ok ill wait
[22:36:58] <rangergord> no, go ahead
[22:37:11] <rangergord> it's like 2 AM, go to sleep. Thanks for proposing tho.
[22:37:29] <rangergord> if you're around tmrw I'll send a jsfiddle
[22:38:35] <reyley> that does sound tempting
[22:38:50] <reyley> but i think ill just wait
[22:39:28] <rangergord> nah seriously. I'm a novice at this, it's gonna take me a while.
[22:39:32] <reyley> ok how about this
[22:39:41] <reyley> click on my name to start a chat with me
[22:39:47] <reyley> paste all your code
[22:39:56] <reyley> and then ill put it in one
[22:40:12] <reyley> double click*
[22:41:35] <reyley> wait actually yea its getting late
[22:41:41] <reyley> send it to me tomorrow if im on
[22:43:19] <rangergord> allright, thx
[23:31:58] <rhalff>  01+-
[23:32:26] <hellier> Is there a better way to write this: $('body').on("click", '.classname', function () { foo.import(); }); ?
[23:32:55] <hellier> the event handler that is, not the foo function
[23:33:49] <Cork> hellier: not sure what you're asking for here
[23:34:24] <hellier> on click of .classname, fire foo.import();
[23:34:52] <Cork> well if you want to bind the foo to the import function so you can use it as an event handler
[23:35:25] <Cork> you can do $('body').on("click", '.classname', $.proxy(foo.import, foo));
[23:36:00] <Cork> or $('body').on("click", '.classname', foo.import.bind(foo)); (depending on what browsers you need to support)
[23:36:24] <Cork> though note, you lose access to the element through this
[23:37:51] <hellier> i see
[23:47:24] <nezZario> So, here's a question
[23:47:43] <nezZario> Is there a way I can do a .ajax and violate cross domain policy, but not get an error because I don't care about the response?
[23:47:55] <Cork> nezZario: no
[23:48:00] <Cork> well actually there is
[23:48:02] <Cork> you can use jsonp
[23:48:11] <Cork> but then you're not really using ajax
[23:48:15] <Cork> (your using <script>)
[23:48:35] <nezZario> Cork: jsonp doesn't work with POST though, correct?
[23:48:52] <Cork> as it is <script> as i said you can only do get calls yes
[23:49:22] <nezZario> Man, I kind of find it weird you can't just "not care" about the reponse..
[23:49:40] <nezZario> ah well, i'll hack something up I guess
[23:49:52] <Cork> nezZario: cors is to protect the user and the remote server from the site developer
[23:50:11] <Cork> nezZario: if you could just opt out from it, it wouldn't really do its job
[23:50:32] <Cork> nezZario: if you control the remote server you can configure it to allow cors for your site
[23:50:44] <Cork> but that is you're only option
[23:51:23] <nezZario> I don't really, it's a form hosted on a SaaS service.. Getting them to insert a HTTP header for my individual form is highly unlikely
[23:51:51] <Cork> nezZario: if there site is secure from xss they could just add a header for *
[23:52:06] <Cork> but they would have to make sure they don't expose user data for stealing
[23:52:11] <nezZario> I find it weird because my browser sends the request, though.  Technically, I could disregard the console error and everything works.  I don't need the response except in the extremely unlikely event it actually makes an error
[23:52:32] <Cork> nezZario: no the browser sends an OPTIONS request
[23:52:44] <Cork> it won't do the post unless it gets a positive answer
[23:52:56] <nezZario> OPTIONS includes post data?
[23:53:00] <Cork> yes
[23:53:07] <nezZario> Hm, I didn't notice the OPTIONS.. Ok that makes more sense then
[23:53:08] <Cork> so the options handler can inspect what will be sent
[23:53:39] <Cork> nezZario: its called a preflight negotiation
[23:54:28] <nezZario> Well, to save me 20 minutes rewriting this form.. is there a way I can sumbit a FormData object normally?
[23:54:39] <nezZario> It's just a demo and I need to sleep :)
[23:54:57] <Cork> nezZario: just disable the data processing in $.ajax
[23:55:03] <Cork> there's an option for that
[23:56:06] <nezZario> no that's what I'm already doing.. I meant turn a Formdata object into a <form ;)
[23:56:19] <Cork> oh, no you cna't
[23:56:21] <Cork> *can't
[23:56:40] <Cork> you can create a physical <form> and run .submit() on it
[23:57:16] <Cork> but you would have to crate all the values as <input> elements
[23:59:12] <hellier> Is something like this possible? init = 'foo'; eval(init) = new SOME(); foo.bar();
[23:59:49] <Cork> hellier: yes, but never ever ever use eval
