[00:00:23] <mydoghasworms> josh99: If it was infinite, wouldn't you run out of memory?
[00:01:11] <josh99> mydoghasworms: not sure. but i see the new images at the beginning and than it's all empty boxes.
[00:01:41] <josh99> it only happend when i add in run time.
[00:01:48] <predat0r> ok its a js methor srry
[00:01:53] <predat0r> method*
[00:02:09] <mydoghasworms> josh99: Sorry, I am of course being facetious. The truth is I have never used jcarousel. Sorry.

[00:07:40] <kenneth> my find('a) is finding nested `a`s

[00:10:57] <nisseni> I don't get a reaction when changing the dropdown - http://pastie.org/private/fouw73kg5zqxu55ivaow
[00:11:00] <nisseni> any ideas?
[00:11:56] <nisseni> nothing happens even in firebug
[00:11:57] <josh99> var arr = []   is this jquery or javascript?
[00:12:36] <predat0r> nisseni: select_af vs. select_af_lan
[00:13:00] <ch3mi0n> josh99: that's js
[00:13:10] <nisseni> predat0r: select_af_lan is the first dropdown, based on the choice there select_af should be populated
[00:13:29] <josh99> ch3mi0n:thanks
[00:15:03] <nisseni> predat0r: or am I mistaken?
[00:15:19] <predat0r> no i see now
[00:15:59] <nisseni> predat0r: I'm using jquery - do I need another lib for json?
[00:16:14] <predat0r> no
[00:16:20] <nisseni> wierd thing is that it doesn't even respond to the change... I have the script in the head
[00:17:18] <predat0r> console.log("go in") into change function and check with firebug
[00:18:12] <ch3mi0n> nisseni: JSON is a native JS feature
[00:18:21] <ch3mi0n> (JavaScript Object Notation)
[00:18:23] <nisseni> ch3mi0n: that's what I thought
[00:18:43] <predat0r> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[00:18:57] <ch3mi0n> But JSON has a strict syntax, so make sure you're doing it right
[00:19:40] <nisseni> predat0r: http://pastie.org/private/tihfz7gutxafja56h69vcq - like that?
[00:20:16] <predat0r> yes if you see log, then change is OK
[00:20:38] <predat0r> need to find different way
[00:20:50] <predat0r> OK-i mean it happens
[00:21:25] <JakeSays> ch3mi0n: json is not a feature.
[00:21:31] <JakeSays> json is javascript.
[00:23:21] <predat0r> niss
[00:23:30] <ch3mi0n> JakeSays: I was putting it into simple terms, but thanks anyway. I have a solid understanding of what JSON is. :)
[00:23:33] <predat0r> nisseni: why .html ? .append ?
[00:23:59] <predat0r> im not sure adding html to a select element works
[00:24:19] <nisseni> predat0r: it's a copy paste from internet
[00:24:22] <ch3mi0n> predat0r: sure it does, if the html is option elements
[00:24:29] <jita> I have 2 datepicker instances in my form. One is used for check-in date and another for check-out. Now i want to set the checkout-date month according to the user selected check-in date. For example, if the user select 14 oct as check in date, the checkout date should automatically have check out date month as october. Is that possible ?
[00:24:36] <predat0r> ok
[00:24:38] <nisseni> but the wierd thing is that I don't even get an error from firebug, like it doesn't even goes thru it
[00:24:58] <nisseni> and I've tried putting the script in both the header and the footer
[00:25:33] <ch3mi0n> nisseni: you need to learn how to stacktrace :)
[00:25:56] <coldhead> god, don't we all
[00:25:58] <nisseni> ch3mi0n: I guess
[00:26:30] <jita> Northwoods: hi
[00:26:47] <nisseni> usually I get some kind of error at least
[00:26:52] <nisseni> but nothing happens
[00:27:55] <ch3mi0n> nisseni: that's where stack tracing becomes your best friend
[00:28:20] <nisseni> I don't even know js or jquery
[00:28:24] <ch3mi0n> The two of you will grow very close and meet each others parents, eventually move in together
[00:29:01] <ch3mi0n> Then you'll get married, have 1.5 children, and then one day you come home from work and realize that stack trace has been cheating on you
[00:29:14] <ch3mi0n> Then you take the little whore to court and get a divorce
[00:29:27] <ch3mi0n> Oh, sorry, got carried away :)
[00:29:32] <nisseni> seems like it
[00:29:53] <hdtdi> i know is maybe not here the place but anyone know something about kcfinder ?
[00:30:27] <predat0r> hdtdi me
[00:31:32] <hdtdi> predat0r,  when i upload a picture, and i choose to use it,then the second menu i have is a menu "link" right? (before clicking ok to visualise the image in the text are)
[00:34:59] <maZtah> hi guys. i want to calculate the days, hours, minutes and seconds until 01/11/2011 (the 1st of november, this year). is there any handy jquery tool to do this?
[00:34:59] <predat0r> good question i dont remember. but you can set up all the menus
[00:35:57] <hdtdi> predat0r, how? i mean i want when i add image, to add default relation to the link of the image, so that lightbox can fire onclick
[00:36:14] <falieson2> I would like to dynamically change the width of an element based on window size, can someone point me to a sample code block?
[00:37:41] <predat0r> hdtdi: sorry i never modified kc that way
[00:37:56] <hdtdi> ah :) thanks tho
[00:38:53] <gnarf> ?var nov1st = new Date(2011, 10, 1, 0, 0, 0); console.log( ( +nov1st - new Date() );
[00:38:55] <bot-t> gnarf, Couldn't find "var nov1st = new Date(2011, 10, 1, 0, 0, 0); console.log( ( +nov1st - new Date() );" in jQuery Docs.

[00:39:19] <gnarf> hrm
[00:39:23] <gnarf> thats wrong
[00:39:25] <gnarf> anyway yeah
[00:39:29] <gnarf> just subtract the dates
[00:39:36] <gnarf> it works when you convert them to numbers
[00:39:48] <gnarf> it'll give you a value in ms
[00:39:52] <gnarf> so you'll need to do some math
[00:39:59] <gnarf> ?date
[00:40:00] <bot-t> gnarf, Plugins/Validation/Methods/date - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/date
[00:40:13] <gnarf> but really, i've never needed it
[00:40:17] <gnarf> so dunno of any useful plugins
[00:42:05] <falieson2> soo... what's wrong with doing this?  $("#left-wrapper").css('width',($(window).width()-$(#right-wrapper).width()));
[00:44:10] <gnarf> falieson2: missing quotes around #right-wrapper
[00:44:32] <falieson2> gnarf: other than that its fine?
[00:44:38] <falieson2> gnarf: ooo!!! my very first jS
[00:44:47] <gnarf> i stopped parsing at the first syntax error
[00:45:28] <gnarf> you don't need the parens around the second argument
[00:45:36] <gnarf> the fact that its an argument kinda implies that
[00:45:55] <gnarf> as far as whats wrong
[00:46:07] <gnarf> setting css like that in JS
[00:46:25] <gnarf> you could probably do that layout effect with pure css
[00:47:23] <falieson2> gnarf: oh yeah?
[00:47:30] <gnarf> i'm no css wizard tho
[00:47:34] <gnarf> maybe someone else here is
[00:47:36] <falieson2> gnarf: I'd be interested to hear how, i'm still a noob at both
[00:48:11] <falieson2> gnarf: thanks a lot for your help
[00:48:13] <falieson2> I can sleep easy now
[00:48:14] <falieson2> :-D
[00:48:35] <Hierofant> $(#right-wrapper)  <-- no such animal
[00:48:38] <ch3mi0n> (You might try #css)
[00:48:52] <ch3mi0n> Hierofant: don't forget your quotes
[00:49:00] <Hierofant> it's not my code :)
[00:49:11] <Hierofant> scroll up
[00:49:21] <falieson2> night guys
[00:49:30] <Hierofant> it was his
[00:49:36] <Hierofant> maybe he'll figure it out
[00:57:23] <ch3mi0n> Wow, clicking a link made Empathy implode
[01:01:35] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: Earlier, you were suggesting handlebars over tmpl(). Question: do templates have to be defined in script tags or can you use a normal div?
[01:02:12] <ch3mi0n> The template itself or the placeholders?
[01:02:31] <mydoghasworms> The template itself.
[01:03:48] <ch3mi0n> mydoghasworms: never tried that, so not sure
[01:03:59] <woozly|job> guys, how to animate background image movement? I'll try: .mouseover(function(){
[01:03:59] <woozly|job> 		$(this).stop().animate(
[01:03:59] <woozly|job> 			{backgroundPosition:"(0 -250px)"},
[01:03:59] <woozly|job> 			{duration:500})
[01:03:59] <woozly|job> 		}), but nothing :(
[01:04:10] <ch3mi0n> :( woozly|job
[01:04:14] <woozly|job> sorry
[01:04:36] <mydoghasworms> OK, because the doc (main page) shows only script tags by example. I actually prefer the fact in tmpl() that you can parse any DOM element.
[01:04:49] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: Tried XIRC?
[01:05:11] <ch3mi0n> No, what platform?
[01:05:17] <mydoghasworms> Linux
[01:05:55] <ch3mi0n> Nope. I've used BitchX, irssi, X Chat, some others...
[01:06:03] <ch3mi0n> Never heard of XIRC
[01:06:34] <mydoghasworms> http://xirc.sourceforge.net/
[01:07:37] <blackspotwiggins> qt :/
[01:07:59] <blackspotwiggins> last update in 2009
[01:09:05] <mydoghasworms> blackspotwiggins: Yet here I am ;-) But seriously, now I was doing an apt-cache search; can't find it, can't remember how I installed it :-(
[01:10:55] <ragas> how can i made an array of slides (currently <LI>'s) start in a randome place, and loop infinitely?  I've got the loop infinite part, but to get the random start, i think i need to rewrite their order in the code before the DOM loads.
[01:10:57] <mydoghasworms> Sorry, it's XChat I'm using :o)
[01:11:13] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: Scrapt that: XChat, not XIRC.
[01:11:28] <ch3mi0n> Yeah XChat for sure
[01:12:03] <Hooloovoo> ragas: you can use Math.random()
[01:12:53] <mydoghasworms> jQuery("#jquery").chat()
[01:15:39] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: OK, looks like you can use other elements with handlebars, not just script tags. But now I have to change all my #{} to {{}}. And then I'm not sure it's going to resolve the issue. But I guess it's worth a try.
[01:16:02] <ch3mi0n> I forget what your issue was even
[01:16:06] <ch3mi0n> :D
[01:16:49] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: It's complicated :-/ (Basically in IE the DOM from the template is not completely rendered before I access it, but there is no way to wait for that rendering to finish).
[01:17:29] <ch3mi0n> Oh right
[01:17:38] <ch3mi0n> Yeah, hopefully that fixes it
[01:17:47] <ch3mi0n> I gotta get some sleep
[01:17:54] <ch3mi0n> Night folks
[01:17:59] <mydoghasworms> ch3mi0n: Thanks and bye.
[01:18:26] <ch3mi0n> See you around. ch3mical = me
[01:20:02] <ragas> Hooloovoo - i can generate a random number, but that doesnt really help me to load the page with a set of LI's in a different order, before document ready.
[01:26:09] <juha_> ragas: put your li's into an array, shuffle it and then display
[01:26:44] <pootietang> hey guys, is there a way to insert the content of an external .html document to a page using jquery?
[01:27:06] <blackspotwiggins> pootietang, this will blow your mind - yes
[01:27:26] <soee> hi, how can i do some action when checkbox is checked and some action when state goes to unchecked?
[01:27:50] <blackspotwiggins> ?change @ soee
[01:27:50] <bot-t> soee, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[01:27:52] <pootietang> wow!
[01:27:53] <SIDU> $('#textareaID').append('abc') works, however, when i input something into the textarea, then the append not works, anyone knows why ?
[01:28:09] <soee> blackspotwiggins, ok thank you
[01:28:39] <pootietang> blackspotwiggins, do you know how?
[01:29:58] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[01:30:22] <soee> blackspotwiggins, will this work if i have 2 checkboxes and only one can be checked ? is i check first one it works but if i check second one the first one becomes unchecked but action sint called this time
[01:30:41] <blackspotwiggins> soee, maybe you need a radio button
[01:31:20] <soee> blackspotwiggins, same with radio
[01:31:22] <SIDU> coldhead: u  there ?
[01:31:44] <blackspotwiggins> soee, radio buttons in a group can only have one of them selected at a time
[01:31:47] <SIDU> i will ask tomorrow then. bye
[01:31:53] <blackspotwiggins> you dont need js for that
[01:32:29] <soee> blackspotwiggins, yeah but if the first one is checked i need to show some content
[01:32:53] <blackspotwiggins> so what's the problem?
[01:35:26] <cypha> how can I get the current URL before a form submission?
[01:35:32] <soee> the problem is that if i select first radio content will show up, than if i select second radio (first one becomes unselected) the content should bi didden but isnt  (when first one go to unselected):/
[01:35:52] <blackspotwiggins> soee, do you have handler for hiding the content?
[01:35:56] <blackspotwiggins> it just doesn't happen magically
[01:36:57] <soee> blackspotwiggins, i testing "change" with simple alerts atm
[01:37:53] <Hussein> if i add ie a click behaviour, will it over-ride or append to the current behaviour?
[01:38:49] <cypha> Hussein, probably append
[01:39:20] <timing> append for sure
[01:39:43] <someprimetime> I have <h3 id="ingredients"></h3> which is above my selector.. when I click on the select, I am setting this variable: var $currentId = $(this).closest("h3").attr("id"); but it's coming back as undefined
[01:39:44] <Hussein> rt
[01:39:45] <Hussein> ty*
[01:39:49] <someprimetime> any reason why?
[01:40:08] <someprimetime> am i not allowed to find an #id attribute on an h3?
[01:40:47] <mytoz> someprimetime: closest looks only on parent nodes
[01:40:58] <mytoz> and the node itself
[01:40:58] <someprimetime> mytoz: ah, i see thanks for the info
[01:41:01] <someprimetime> i'll do something else then
[01:41:14] <mytoz> ?closest
[01:41:14] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/

[03:26:30] <Test5000843> ok I see, well: on my site http://www.ioho.me/index2.html some jQuery files don´t seem to work, on IE8 it doesn´t show the tabs correctly for example.
[03:27:25] <Test5000843> on my PC it runs, but on some others not, so I wanna make sure it runs. or maybe the slideshow + video are too much?
[03:36:09] <catcatcat> hi, im very new to jquery, i am creating my own slider plugin (just to learn). i am trying to add options functionality to it. when i add my slider stops working:http://pastebin.com/8hX3nBSh  is there anyone to give me some guidance?
[03:36:13] <catcatcat> http://pastebin.com/8hX3nBSh
[03:40:34] <predat0r> hm if i set defaultDate : '1/8/2011' (datepicker) manually, it work but if i use a variable, not. defaultDate : '" + date_var + "'   any idea why?
[03:40:34] <Test5000843> hmm does anyone have an idea to my issue?
[03:44:51] <Kambfhase> ?p @ predat0r
[03:44:52] <bot-t> predat0r, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:46:28] <Kambfhase> catcatcat: options = $.extend($.fn.shivaSlider.defaults, options); << shouldn't this bethe other way round?
[03:47:04] <catcatcat> Kambfhase: how do you mean?
[03:47:29] <Kambfhase> options = $.extend(options, $.fn.shivaSlider.defaults);
[03:47:53] <catcatcat> hmm ok
[03:47:58] <catcatcat> let me test that, thanks
[03:49:26] <catcatcat> nope didnt work !
[03:51:10] <Kambfhase> what do yu mean by 'dont work'?
[03:51:24] <Kambfhase> feel free to create a ?demo

[03:52:38] <catcatcat> Kambfhase: do i need to define pagimation as variable?
[03:52:53] <soc42> how can i access a browser file download dialog with jquery?
[03:53:20] <soc42> i need to catch the event when or before this dialog box opens
[03:54:01] <soc42> i have a progress bar (div with loading icon) which is beeing displayed on a parent page when the download link is clicked
[03:54:41] <predat0r> Kambfhase: thx but its more complicated that it will run in jsfiddle. in theory is there difference between hardcoded parameter and a variable contains parameter?
[03:55:18] <soc42> when the download dialog window opens, the progessbar-div is still running and i want to hide it, but have no clue how to do that
[03:55:53] <Kambfhase> catcatcat: use jshint.com to find the big errors in your code ;)
[03:56:11] <soc42> the problem with the download dialog is, that there is no html header which i can call an onload event
[03:56:18] <catcatcat> wow cool :)
[03:56:21] <catcatcat> will try it
[03:56:40] <Kambfhase> predat0r: no, there should be any diffference.
[03:56:49] <Kambfhase> *should'nt
[03:57:44] <predat0r> Kambfhase: ok thx

[04:00:05] <bot-t> detailiffanu, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:00:12] <detailiffanu> i.e. if ( condition ) { do stuff1 } else { do stuff2 } else { do stuff3 }
[04:00:19] <detailiffanu> why doesn't it work?
[04:00:37] <Kambfhase> if ( condition ) { do stuff1 } else if (condition2){ do stuff2 } else { do stuff3 }
[04:00:49] <Kambfhase> yours just doesn't make sense
[04:00:49] <detailiffanu> there is no condition2
[04:00:52] <detailiffanu> why?
[04:01:11] <Kambfhase> when would you want the second else block to be executed?
[04:01:30] <detailiffanu> when first else block isn't
[04:01:38] <Kambfhase> there is nothing falsier than false. and on false the else block gets executed
[04:01:48] <detailiffanu> what?
[04:02:22] <Kambfhase> when the condition turns out to be false the else block is executed.
[04:02:32] <detailiffanu> so?
[04:02:43] <Kambfhase> the condition can be either true or false.
[04:02:54] <Kambfhase> so your code can have only two branchesa
[04:02:59] <detailiffanu> if ( i==2 ) { alert("i is 2!"); } else { alert("i is not 2!"); } else { alert("but i is 2!"); }
[04:03:27] <Kambfhase> if ( i==2 ) { alert("i is 2!"); } else { alert("i is not 2!"); alert("but i is 2!"); }
[04:03:31] <detailiffanu> so if i is 2 then main block and second else block should be executed
[04:03:38] <melkornemesis> what about else if
[04:03:52] <detailiffanu> Kambfhase: yours doesn't do what it should
[04:04:11] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: there is only 1 condition
[04:04:11] <soc42> is there something like  on window.blur()  in jquery?
[04:04:13] <Kambfhase> detailiffanu: you do know switch()?
[04:04:22] <detailiffanu> Kambfhase: yes
[04:04:31] <detailiffanu> but it sux
[04:04:34] <predat0r> Kambfhase: should be good if I pass param so: defaultDate: "'" + date + "'"  ? date = '1/8/2011'
[04:04:48] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: huh, in JS i cant do else if?
[04:04:49] <detailiffanu> Kambfhase: so why doesn't else of else work?
[04:04:56] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: else if <what>?
[04:05:04] <detailiffanu> if ( i==2 ) { alert("i is 2!"); } else { alert("i is not 2!"); } else { alert("but i is 2!"); }
[04:05:06] <detailiffanu> how would you write that?
[04:05:09] <detailiffanu> with else if?
[04:05:26] <Hussein> hi, quick issue: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0V       works like it should, but only after the first time i click, why does it seem to only start working after the first click?
[04:05:34] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: i dont get the "but i is 2!" part
[04:05:43] <melkornemesis> when it should be processed
[04:06:09] <Kambfhase> predat0r: why not simply: date = '1/8/2011'; defaultDate: date
[04:06:13] <melkornemesis> at what circumstances is it called
[04:06:25] <predat0r> Kambfhase: not working :(
[04:06:34] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: when first else isn't run
[04:06:50] <Kambfhase> when first else isnt run your if block is run!
[04:06:56] <detailiffanu> yes
[04:07:00] <predat0r> shit, working, sorry
[04:07:05] <Kambfhase> :)
[04:07:05] <detailiffanu> so second else should be run when main block is
[04:07:17] <Kambfhase> if ( i==2 ) { alert("i is 2!"); alert("but i is 2!"); } else { alert("i is not 2!"); }
[04:07:19] <predat0r> thx
[04:07:29] <melkornemesis> yup
[04:07:31] <detailiffanu> and third else block (if existed) would be run when second else isn't
[04:07:42] <detailiffanu> Kambfhase: hmm
[04:07:50] <melkornemesis> as Kambfhase wrote
[04:07:50] <detailiffanu> this code doesn't seem logical
[04:07:57] <Kambfhase> o.O
[04:08:05] <detailiffanu> what if i must have like 5-6 elses?
[04:08:08] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: what part doesnt seem logical? its pretty simple
[04:08:16] <detailiffanu> if i will put all of them in 2 blocks, code will get really ugluy
[04:08:18] <detailiffanu> ugly *
[04:08:46] <Kambfhase> if you have 5-6 options use 5-6 if clauses or switch or, arrays and objects( advanced):
[04:08:56] <detailiffanu> i.e. if (i==2) { i+=2 } else {i--} else {i+=6} else {i-=3} else {i=11} else {i=121}
[04:09:02] <detailiffanu> how would you write that/
[04:09:04] <moo-_-> what was selenium like functional testing framework written with jQuery?
[04:09:07] <melkornemesis> what the hell :)
[04:09:19] <hdtdi> hi guys so here is the deal. i am inserting pictures in an article with ckeditor. but the editor dont have an option for adding rel to the <a> attr and i need it to fire lightbox when someone click on the picture. so i wrote a script and i put it above the lighbox script but below jquery.js (thats in the header section). http://pastebin.com/i2NwS7xs and this is the script. so basically i want when the document is loaded and someone put his
[04:09:19] <hdtdi> mouse on the picture, to add rel="lightbox" to every <a> that is a parent (in this case have <img> inside, and is within the .OnePost class ? but the lightbox is not fireing
[04:09:27] <xec> detailiffanu: what are you trying to achieve here?
[04:09:39] <detailiffanu> xec: i don't understand why can't i write else for else
[04:09:45] <detailiffanu> isn't it logical?
[04:09:50] <Kambfhase> no.
[04:09:53] <xec> detailiffanu: not really
[04:09:53] <detailiffanu> why?
[04:10:06] <xec> detailiffanu: what do you expect the else to do?
[04:10:16] <Kambfhase> JavaScript does not use fuzzy logic.
[04:10:18] <detailiffanu> xec: to execute if previous block wasn't executed
[04:10:28] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: you can write conditions into conditions
[04:10:37] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: what if there is only 1 condition?
[04:10:41] <detailiffanu> what is the point of duplicating it?
[04:10:48] <Kambfhase> detailiffanu: thats is not the definition of an else block.
[04:11:08] <detailiffanu> if (i==2) { stuff1(); } else { stuff2(); } else if (i==2) { stuff3(); }
[04:11:18] <detailiffanu> looks ugly
[04:11:24] <Kambfhase> and its wrong, too.
[04:11:37] <Kambfhase> if (i==2) { stuff1(); stuff3(); } else { stuff2(); }
[04:11:38] <detailiffanu> well it does the same as just 2 elses
[04:11:52] <detailiffanu> Kambfhase: well this will make code more difficult to read
[04:11:56] <detailiffanu> if there are many else blocks
[04:12:03] <detailiffanu> everything will be in one place
[04:12:05] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: but its the basic of the conditions
[04:12:11] <detailiffanu> what basis?
[04:12:22] <Kambfhase> Kambfhase: well this will make code more difficult to read << i dis agree on this.
[04:12:31] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: u cant do things like u write
[04:12:41] <melkornemesis> what is bad about "if (i==2) { stuff1(); stuff3(); } else { stuff2(); }" ?
[04:12:47] <xec> indeed
[04:13:29] <xec> i don't see why you would want to check the same condition twice
[04:14:56] <melkornemesis> xec: besides .. when the first condition is true, it stops executing the conditions tree, so it wouldnt pass to his second same condition at all
[04:15:25] <melkornemesis> condition is true, it will execute it and thats it, it skips the other else / else ifs
[04:15:37] <xec> of course, but apparently he has some reason to want do do so
[04:15:45] <xec> which i don't see
[04:15:51] <melkornemesis> xec: me neither
[04:24:32] <hdtdi> no one? for my problem?
[04:24:44] <samueljon> Hi All, Anyone here that has been working with jquery-tools. I'm having problem working with multiple tabs on the same page
[04:25:13] <samueljon> the tab pane for the the second tab-set is not displayed
[04:26:02] <samueljon> I'm following http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tabs/multiple.html
[04:26:25] <xec> hdtdi: i'm just taking a wild stab, but maybe you need the rel attribute set before lightbox is loaded?
[04:26:29] <seutje> hdtdi: why are u doing this on mouseover? isn't the lightbox event handler bound before that?
[04:27:10] <seutje> hdtdi: also, I'm not familiar with :parent, is this something you defined?
[04:27:21] <hdtdi> seutje, i have nooo idea, i dont understand jquery enought to go to the code and look what it does :(
[04:28:08] <seutje> if you can't think of a reason to do it on mouseover, how about not doing it?
[04:28:11] <hdtdi> seutje, :parent is a filter that matches all elements that are parents
[04:28:25] <hdtdi> seutje,  then when to do it ?
[04:28:36] <seutje> hdtdi: so you defined :parent youself?
[04:28:37] <slavabulgakov> hi all! how set <div> in horizontal center?
[04:28:49] <hdtdi> seutje, no..
[04:29:06] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/parent-selector/
[04:29:28] <seutje> oh shit, never ran into that
[04:29:43] <seutje> hdtdi: do it as quickly as possible I guess
[04:30:20] <hdtdi> seutje, but isnt $(document).ready().. ready, even before the images are loaded?
[04:30:41] <seutje> hdtdi: who cares if they're loaded?
[04:30:46] <xec> yes, .ready() is, but not .mouseover()
[04:31:09] <seutje> why would the src have to be done downloading to add an attribute?
[04:31:30] <geoffgeoff> jquery is OK
[04:31:46] <hdtdi> seutje, ok i  removed the whole event . and now its document.ready () .. set the attr and again not working
[04:31:59] <seutje> hmm, hdtdi: in your example, do your images have the class OnePost?
[04:32:53] <seutje> because '.OnePost a:parent' would mean "any <a> that has children and is nested within a .OnePost"
[04:32:54] <xec> slavabulgakov: you can give the div a static width and set margin: auto;
[04:32:55] <hdtdi> hm no i thought that hmm.. wait wait lets ask because i obviously have a mistake.. how to select an <a> that is in within a class .OnePost.. not having it as attr
[04:33:16] <woozly|job> guys, what to do? I bind .hover listener on <TD> and when I move in TD element it fires okay, but If I move mouse over text in TD - it stop firing :((
[04:33:29] <seutje> hdtdi: sample markup would be a blessing at this point
[04:34:02] <hdtdi> seutje, http://pastebin.com/Rjgz5fkF
[04:34:03] <samueljon> The problem with the tabs I was talking about can be found here: http://ytri.lmi.is/?page_id=1459
[04:34:40] <slavabulgakov> xec:could you explain in more detail?
[04:34:42] <detailiffanu> 14:24:18 melkornemesis | what is bad about "if (i==2) { stuff1(); stuff3(); } else { stuff2(); }" ?
[04:34:46] <detailiffanu> it isn't readable
[04:35:10] <detailiffanu> wait, i will give you a good example
[04:35:14] <slavabulgakov> xec:or give an example
[04:35:38] <xec> slavabulgakov: if you just want to center a div, it has little to do with jquery, and everything to do with css, so you could ask in #css - you doing this with a script for some reason?
[04:35:47] <geoffgeoff> div:regex(id,Ident) saved me about...10 minutes of copypaste
[04:36:12] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: ok, gimme .. but http://kodo.ameoto.com/0460986646 seems ok to me
[04:36:33] <detailiffanu> if ( mustgotowork() ) { wakeup(); } else { sleepsomemore(); } else { brush_teeth(); } else { sleepsomemore(); } else { putclotheson() } else { wakeup(); } else { drivetowork(); } else { invitesomechicks() } .....
[04:36:48] <xec> slavabulgakov: http://jsfiddle.net/h3M7g/
[04:36:49] <mytoz> wtf.
[04:36:53] <detailiffanu> sounds quite logical to me
[04:37:20] <xec> doesnt make much sense to me
[04:37:29] <mytoz> does make zero sense to me
[04:37:40] <detailiffanu> not funny
[04:37:41] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: you can think however you want about this, but you will never be able to do that
[04:37:41] <melkornemesis> 1) you'll get an syntax error
[04:37:41] <melkornemesis> 2) processed will be ONLY one branch
[04:37:48] <mytoz> which is greater than -1
[04:37:56] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: yes, that's why i am asking here
[04:38:04] <detailiffanu> i think it is js's / jquery's bug
[04:38:25] <mytoz> it's not a bug
[04:38:28] <xec> detailiffanu: maybe read up on conditional statements?
[04:38:32] <mytoz> it's like that by design
[04:38:32] <slavabulgakov> xec: i want set <div> in center by animate
[04:38:32] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[04:38:33] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: it has no sense
[04:38:36] <detailiffanu> xec: i did read about them
[04:38:38] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: why?
[04:38:43] <melkornemesis> you cant do this in any programming language i suppose
[04:38:51] <mytoz> if that doesn't suit you, find some other language
[04:38:57] <aaronmcadam> what can't u do?
[04:39:00] <detailiffanu> well i need to write it in jquery
[04:39:07] <seutje> hdtdi: adding the attribute seems to work fine here: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/QxCdf/
[04:39:11] <aaronmcadam> what are you guys trying to do
[04:39:16] <mytoz> jquery isn't a language. jquery is a framework/utility library.
[04:39:22] <xec> slavabulgakov: what do you have so far?
[04:39:23] <detailiffanu> mytoz: okay, js
[04:39:27] <Shwaiil> Q: After using .preventDefault() is there a way to continue to the default event ? I'm doing a form validation and I dont want to be specific to each form, but actually have my script use any inputs there is, validate it, if ok continue. Any tips ? thank you!
[04:39:34] <melkornemesis> its quite straightforward, 	either the condition is true or it is not
[04:39:35] <slavabulgakov> xec: i want animate <div> in center from right side smoothly
[04:39:36] <aaronmcadam> what are u trying to do detailiffanu
[04:39:40] <melkornemesis> there is no other option
[04:39:46] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: i need to use else of else statements
[04:39:52] <melkornemesis> aaronmcadam: no one knows :)
[04:39:53] <detailiffanu> but they don't work for some strange reason
[04:39:54] <aaronmcadam> why?
[04:39:55] <melkornemesis> *know
[04:40:04] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: because code is logibal
[04:40:04] <aaronmcadam> you never heard of a switch
[04:40:06] <detailiffanu> logical *
[04:40:20] <detailiffanu> if i will put everything together it will become too obfuscated to read
[04:40:23] <Paveloosha> Hi guys.. how to do this in Javascript, "$('.mydiv').find('subDiv')" .
[04:40:35] <aaronmcadam> you shouldn't use too many if statement branches, you should have functions that return the boolean you want
[04:40:41] <hdtdi> seutje, how can i see on my project if its added? so if it is, then xec  is write and i am adding it after after lightbox do stuf..
[04:40:49] <slavabulgakov> xec: what?
[04:41:06] <Shwaiil> Paveloosha, .find('div') or .find('.diVclassName'), or .find('#divId') ?!
[04:41:15] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: noone but you see the problem
[04:41:37] <Shwaiil> melkornemesis, hey. Was that tip above for me, on preventDefault ?
[04:41:59] <Paveloosha> <Shwaiil>,find any element.
[04:42:01] <mytoz> it's like formalising an argument like this: 1. all men are mortal 2. I eat cat food 3. there's a fish in my perculator 4. ergo, all swans are white
[04:42:24] <melkornemesis> Shwaiil: i hasn't wrote anything to you, so probably doesnt
[04:42:28] <mytoz> the logic is valid and sound.
[04:42:45] <Paveloosha> <Shwaiil>,suppose ".divClass".
[04:42:49] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: the problem is - else of else do not work...
[04:42:57] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:43:00] <aaronmcadam> you're very confused
[04:43:11] <detailiffanu> yes, i had never expected such a bug
[04:43:15] <xec> hehe
[04:43:16] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: i know your problem
[04:43:18] <aaronmcadam> think you need to sit down and think about your control flow
[04:43:26] <detailiffanu> my control flow is perfect
[04:43:31] <detailiffanu> i don't understand why doesn't it work
[04:43:32] <aaronmcadam> haha course it is lol
[04:43:35] <seutje> hdtdi: sry, what?
[04:43:40] <xec> slavabulgakov: sry, i'm not sure of the best way
[04:43:46] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: not a bug man! :)
[04:43:54] <melkornemesis> its just how conditions works
[04:43:55] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: okay, how would you rewrite this:
[04:43:57] <melkornemesis> *work
[04:43:59] <detailiffanu> if ( mustgotowork() ) { wakeup(); } else { sleepsomemore(); } else { brush_teeth(); } else { sleepsomemore(); } else { putclotheson() } else { wakeup(); } else { drivetowork(); } else { invitesomechicks() } .....
[04:44:01] <seutje> hdtdi: is it just me or does lightbox require prototype?
[04:44:11] <aaronmcadam> detailiffanu: as I said already, you need to write boolean functions that return the right flow
[04:44:20] <aaronmcadam> that doesn';t make sense!
[04:44:22] <Shwaiil> Paveloosha, $('#parentDivID').find('.divClass');
[04:44:23] <detailiffanu> lol
[04:44:28] <detailiffanu> why?
[04:44:29] <aaronmcadam> you're not returning any boolean are u?
[04:44:32] <hdtdi> seutje, i dont know what prototype is. i actually dont know anything about lightbox.. i just downloaded it and saw in the documentation how to use it
[04:44:34] <aaronmcadam> or are u?
[04:44:36] <mytoz> what the hell...
[04:44:40] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: i even dont see the logic in you else statements, the order os something
[04:44:42] <Shwaiil> Paveloosha, $('.parentDivClass').find('.divClass');
[04:44:46] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: okay, i can explain
[04:44:50] <detailiffanu> this means:
[04:44:51] <slavabulgakov> xec: and then as I do that?
[04:44:58] <aaronmcadam> something that's not as trivial as that
[04:44:58] <detailiffanu> 1) i check if i must go to work or not today
[04:45:00] <seutje> hdtdi: well, the documentation tells me to include prototype and scriptaculous...
[04:45:06] <detailiffanu> 2) if yes - then i wakeup, otherwise sleep some more
[04:45:12] <seutje> hdtdi: http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/#how
[04:45:18] <detailiffanu> if i haven't sleep some more - i brush my teeth
[04:45:18] <aaronmcadam> right
[04:45:24] <detailiffanu> if i haven't brushed my teeth - i sleep some more
[04:45:27] <aaronmcadam> that's not how it works
[04:45:33] <detailiffanu> ?
[04:45:35] <aaronmcadam> u need another else if
[04:45:36] <aaronmcadam> not else
[04:45:38] <Paveloosha> <Shwaiil>, I did not ask for jQuery.. I asked for the replacement in core Javascript..
[04:45:41] <aaronmcadam> else is a catchall
[04:45:47] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: okay, how would you rewrite it with else if?
[04:45:50] <aaronmcadam> so u need else if getting up
[04:45:53] <xec> slavabulgakov: what?
[04:45:55] <aaronmcadam> that's the point
[04:45:57] <Shwaiil> Paveloosha, you should go to #javascript instead
[04:46:00] <Aamir> hdtdi: Lightbox 2 uses the Prototype Framework and Scriptaculous Effects Library. You will need to include these three Javascript files in your header (in this order).
[04:46:05] <hdtdi> seutje, yeah.. i included this files and stuff and when i add manually to my source code rel="lightbox" its working.
[04:46:09] <aaronmcadam> you're misunderstanding logic
[04:46:12] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: how long are u scripting in JS?
[04:46:17] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: 8 years
[04:46:25] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: okay, can you rewrite my code with else if please?
[04:46:28] <melkornemesis> hard to believe
[04:46:29] <seutje> hdtdi: when and how are you initializing lightbox?
[04:46:30] <aaronmcadam> there's no predicate you're setting
[04:46:36] <detailiffanu> ?
[04:46:42] <aaronmcadam> you need to read up on logic
[04:46:47] <Paveloosha> <Shwaiil>,ok sorry about that but how to do that in #javascript?
[04:46:50] <detailiffanu> can you rewrite the code?
[04:46:51] <hdtdi> seutje, you mean in my header? what is the consistency ?
[04:46:58] <aaronmcadam> what ur trying to do without resetting a predicate won't work
[04:47:14] <slavabulgakov> xec: how to do it?
[04:47:21] <Shwaiil> Paveloosha, how to do what ?! Ask how to select a DIV element by referencing it's parent ?
[04:47:24] <aaronmcadam> it's impossible to have multiple elses
[04:47:34] <hdtdi> first jquery, then my script, than the 3 scripts in exact order, the way its shown in the documentation of lightbox
[04:47:37] <aaronmcadam> without an else if
[04:47:39] <Shwaiil> Paveloosha, how to select child div from div parent ?! :P
[04:47:46] <mytoz> detailiffanu: seems more like you're looking for a state machine
[04:47:48] <mytoz> or something
[04:48:05] <detailiffanu> what is a state machine?
[04:48:11] <Paveloosha> <Shwaiil>, Thanks for your help..
[04:48:12] <slavabulgakov> anybody help! how animate set <div> on horizontal center from right side?
[04:48:12] <uhwo> lol :D
[04:48:13] <aaronmcadam> detailiffanu: you'd need else if ( don't have to wake up ) { ...
[04:48:14] <mytoz> ?state machine
[04:48:18] <bot-t> mytoz, jquery ajax statemachine | jQuery Plugins - Ajax machine allows ajax events to be declaratively defined and executed. This results in centralized and more maintainable code. http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/jquery-ajax-statemachine
[04:48:19] <aaronmcadam> yes mytoz
[04:48:23] <mytoz> uhm no
[04:48:28] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: that will add TONS of functions to my code
[04:48:28] <mytoz> that's not quite it. ah well.
[04:48:31] <aaronmcadam> if something needs to happen in a certain order
[04:48:34] <aaronmcadam> of course
[04:48:39] <aaronmcadam> your algorithm is flawed
[04:48:47] <aaronmcadam> that's why detailiffanu
[04:48:48] <detailiffanu> why?
[04:48:49] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tutorials/javascript/javascript_else_if.php3
[04:48:54] <mytoz> your *thinking* is flawed, sorry
[04:48:57] <detailiffanu> lol
[04:48:57] <aaronmcadam> yes!
[04:48:59] <xec> slavabulgakov: maybe something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/h3M7g/1/
[04:49:00] <seutje> hdtdi: heh, well the fact that the lightbox docs tell u to put it in the header should already throw a lil red flag
[04:49:14] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: i KNOW about else if
[04:49:14] <aaronmcadam> am I getting thru to u at all detailiffanu
[04:49:20] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: so USE it
[04:49:24] <detailiffanu> but i don't want to fill my code with hundreds of checks
[04:49:27] <aaronmcadam> do u understand why what ur trying to do doesn't work
[04:49:33] <detailiffanu> with else blocks i can have ONLY 1 CHECK
[04:49:33] <aaronmcadam> well then ur code won't work then
[04:49:34] <hdtdi> seutje, so they also have socument ready or what?
[04:49:34] <slavabulgakov> xec: yeees! thanks :)
[04:49:43] <seutje> hdtdi: I guess lightbox initializes before doc rdy
[04:49:48] <aaronmcadam> any language will only hit one else
[04:49:49] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: well, maybe there is a patch or library that adds else of else functionality?
[04:49:52] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[04:49:53] <aaronmcadam> patch my arse
[04:49:58] <aaronmcadam> it's fundamental to programming
[04:50:04] <detailiffanu> no.
[04:50:05] <seutje> hdtdi: try putting it all at the bottom of the page and remove the document rdy shizzle
[04:50:18] <xec> aaronmcadam: i'm starting to think detailiffanu is trolling
[04:50:23] <detailiffanu> ...
[04:50:24] <aaronmcadam> probably
[04:50:27] <aaronmcadam> or he's just an idiot
[04:50:30] <melkornemesis> xec++
[04:50:33] <seutje> hdtdi: if that doesn't do it, try getting help from ppl who've actually used prototype
[04:50:35] <hdtdi> seutje, you mean from my script or from lightbox script?
[04:50:40] <aaronmcadam> "i don't want to write the code that will make my program work"
[04:50:50] <aaronmcadam> "is there a library that COMPLETELY CHANGES HOW LOGIC WORKS"
[04:50:51] <xec> slavabulgakov: the "100" is just half of the width i set in the css
[04:50:51] <aaronmcadam> hahaha :D
[04:51:02] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: or maybe - you can write your own compiler ;)
[04:51:04] <seutje> hdtdi: ur script, I guess o.O
[04:51:09] <aaronmcadam> a library that will guess what you want to run
[04:51:15] <aaronmcadam> try Prolog detailiffanu haha
[04:51:27] <detailiffanu> stop trolling man
[04:51:33] <Shwaiil> Q: After using .preventDefault() is there a way to continue to the default event ? I'm doing a form validation and I dont want to be specific to each form, but actually have my script use any inputs there is, validate it, if ok continue. Any tips ? thank you!
[04:51:39] <Kambfhase> fuzzylogic.js new Fuzzy(): true or false or maybe
[04:51:45] <aaronmcadam> heh
[04:51:53] <mytoz> hrm
[04:51:55] <detailiffanu> i don't need 'maybe' functionality yet
[04:51:57] <mytoz> true, false, filenotfound
[04:51:57] <aaronmcadam> hehe I'm done
[04:52:07] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: you can discuss however u want abt it, we told u how it works, you have to write your code like that
[04:52:09] <slavabulgakov> xec: I realized :)
[04:52:13] <mytoz> it's the idiom
[04:52:39] <aaronmcadam> hehe :D
[04:52:41] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: well i asked if there are any libraries that implement that
[04:52:49] <aaronmcadam> you're crazy man
[04:52:53] <aaronmcadam> where did u learn to program
[04:52:54] <detailiffanu> why??
[04:53:06] <aaronmcadam> where have u ever seen mutliple elses?
[04:53:09] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: there are not, they have no reason to
[04:53:12] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: in my code
[04:53:13] <xec> detailiffanu: I don't think everyone in here except you are wrong... if you're so sure you're not trolling, try to redefine your question
[04:53:15] <melkornemesis> cause it has no logic
[04:53:19] <aaronmcadam> without a qualifying boolean
[04:53:24] <detailiffanu> xec: okay
[04:53:27] <detailiffanu> hmm
[04:53:55] <aaronmcadam> detailiffanu: accept that the code you're writing is completely wrong please
[04:53:59] <detailiffanu> i need to write code blocks that depends on previous block's 'executed' state
[04:54:09] <xec> or show use some actual code that would needs this "functionality"
[04:54:14] <xec> need*
[04:54:17] <detailiffanu> xec: i did it multiple times
[04:54:18] <aaronmcadam> yeah you need a different pattern rather than if statements
[04:54:23] <detailiffanu> if ( mustgotowork() ) { wakeup(); } else { sleepsomemore(); } else { brush_teeth(); } else { sleepsomemore(); } else { putclotheson() } else { wakeup(); } else { drivetowork(); } else { invitesomechicks() } .....
[04:54:30] <melkornemesis> detailiffanu: conditions in conditions is what are you looking for
[04:54:33] <aaronmcadam> you're missing the point
[04:54:34] <detailiffanu> every block depends on if previous was executed
[04:54:36] <xec> detailiffanu: no, you showed us nonsensical pseudo code
[04:54:40] <mytoz> that's fucking stupid.
[04:54:44] <aaronmcadam> hahaha :D
[04:54:46] <NodeX> do you expect that else bloc to work ?
[04:54:52] <detailiffanu> xec: well it illustrates else of else functionality perfectly
[04:54:58] <aaronmcadam> I've repeated that like 5 times already NodeX :D
[04:55:04] <xec> detailiffanu: why on earth would you want that when you can do everything inside the first two blocks?
[04:55:04] <detailiffanu> NodeX: every else block should work only if previous wasn't
[04:55:11] <NodeX> it will die after 1 else - that's if it even compiles
[04:55:15] <aaronmcadam> detailiffanu: you're misunderstanding logic i keep saying
[04:55:19] <detailiffanu> xec: because this will make code too obfuscated to read
[04:55:23] <detailiffanu> and illogical
[04:55:27] <xec> detailiffanu: i beg to differ
[04:55:31] <Kambfhase> well it illustrates else of else functionality perfectly << the only functionalty else-else has is throwing a syntax error.
[04:55:40] <xec> detailiffanu: it is your pseudo code that doesnt make any sense. at all
[04:55:45] <detailiffanu> Kambfhase: well that's the issue i was asking about
[04:55:46] <aaronmcadam> and your crazy else bullshit is easy to read?
[04:55:48] <mytoz> detailiffanu: something like this might work: function foo() { foo(); }
[04:55:55] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: um, yes.
[04:55:58] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:56:01] <detailiffanu> mytoz: not funny
[04:56:05] <xec> hehe
[04:56:08] <mytoz> it makes perfect sense
[04:56:09] <xec> i thought it was funny ;)
[04:56:18] <detailiffanu> it would be funny with forking
[04:56:23] <detailiffanu> but i don't know how to do it in js
[04:56:36] <aaronmcadam> you don't know how to do it in any language at all
[04:56:36] <xec> you can't afaik
[04:56:40] <detailiffanu> ok, i will explain in more detail
[04:56:45] <mytoz> you know what forking is, but you can't write simple conditionals?
[04:56:47] <aaronmcadam> because it's fundamentally impossible
[04:56:53] <detailiffanu> mytoz: my conditionals are perfect
[04:56:57] <xec> lol
[04:57:01] <mytoz> detailiffanu: your conditionals are retarded
[04:57:04] <detailiffanu> why?
[04:57:09] <aaronmcadam> I had to laugh when u asked if there's a library for it lol
[04:57:10] <xec> i am actually laughing out loud now
[04:57:20] <aaronmcadam> oh yeah!
[04:57:22] <NodeX> are you trolling ?
[04:57:23] <melkornemesis> if ( mustgotowork() ) { if(wakeup()) { if (brush_teeth()) { if (putclotheson()) { if (drivetowork()) {} } } } } else { sleepsomemore(); }
[04:57:25] <detailiffanu> i don't see anything funny here
[04:57:27] <detailiffanu> NodeX: no
[04:57:38] <detailiffanu> melkornemesis: no, this don't do the same
[04:57:40] <aaronmcadam> There's a $.jquery.doImpossibleLogic plugin :D
[04:57:44] <xec> hehehe
[04:57:45] <melkornemesis> so rewrite it
[04:58:00] <Kambfhase> trools http://www.reece-eu.net/gallery/var/albums/funny/how-trolls-really-work.png?m=1272640438
[04:58:02] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: what on earth is impossible about that?
[04:58:09] <melkornemesis> guys, i am going off this, waste of time :)
[04:58:13] <detailiffanu> isn't it obvious that else block is the same as main block?
[04:58:17] <detailiffanu> and can have else block too?
[04:58:22] <aaronmcadam> It's features include: "Guessing which line of code to run!"
[04:58:27] <mytoz> sure, it's obvious to you
[04:58:31] <NodeX> Kambfhase : LMFAO
[04:59:10] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:59:10] <mytoz> what you're asking for is not even intuitively sane.
[04:59:14] <detailiffanu> mytoz: why?
[04:59:19] <detailiffanu> explain plz
[04:59:25] <aaronmcadam> bit better melkornemesis but if my team members wrote that i'd whack em round the head lol
[04:59:33] <mytoz> it's just brain barf, and I will not elaborate further
[04:59:41] <detailiffanu> 'brain barf'?
[04:59:42] <detailiffanu> what is it
[04:59:45] <detailiffanu> i'm not good at english
[04:59:49] <aaronmcadam> he's just not getting it mytoz I wanna give up lol
[04:59:56] <Kambfhase> brain barf is like Brainfuck++
[05:00:02] <detailiffanu> because you aren't explaing anything
[05:00:08] <detailiffanu> you just shout that my logic is wrong
[05:00:16] <aaronmcadam> yes it is
[05:00:22] <aaronmcadam> I've explained it like 5 times already
[05:00:22] <detailiffanu> but why it is?
[05:00:24] <mytoz> it has been explained several times
[05:00:25] <melkornemesis> aaronmcadam: :D
[05:00:26] <detailiffanu> oh? wher?
[05:00:29] <detailiffanu> where?
[05:00:31] <aaronmcadam> ok
[05:00:34] <NodeX> detailiffanu : what are you trying to achieve
[05:00:36] <Kambfhase> we already gave you like halave a dozent examples on how to write your code in valid JS
[05:00:37] <detailiffanu> < paste the explanation here >
[05:00:44] <detailiffanu> NodeX: to make my code work, obviously
[05:00:51] <NodeX> and where is your code
[05:00:54] <detailiffanu> Kambfhase: yes, and all these examples did different thing
[05:00:56] <xec> detailiffanu: we havent even seen your code
[05:00:58] <detailiffanu> than my original code
[05:01:02] <detailiffanu> xec: i showed it
[05:01:04] <NodeX> that else block up there from earlier ?
[05:01:13] <detailiffanu> NodeX: yes
[05:01:16] <xec> detailiffanu: could you pastebin it ?
[05:01:17] <NodeX> that will never work
[05:01:25] <detailiffanu> xec: pastebin what?
[05:01:26] <NodeX> you need else if
[05:01:27] <aaronmcadam> detailiffanu: here goes again: You CAN'T have multiple else statements without a qualifying if! What's wrong with u lol
[05:01:28] <xec> your code
[05:01:30] <seutje> think I automagically blocked that out
[05:01:31] <Kambfhase> yes, and all these examples did different thing han my original code << well, yeah ,your code throws a syntax error, abviously.
[05:01:42] <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: else doesn't require if
[05:01:46] <NodeX> else if (condition) {} ....
[05:01:47] <aaronmcadam> oh my god
[05:01:48] <detailiffanu> it just require that previous block wasn't run
[05:01:55] <aaronmcadam> you can only have one "else"
[05:01:58] <detailiffanu> its like ||
[05:02:01] <aaronmcadam> any others must have "if else"
[05:02:03] <Kambfhase> <detailiffanu> aaronmcadam: else doesn't require if << ok, your troll is obvious now.
[05:02:06] <dr0id> hi, I am looking for food.
[05:02:07] <seutje> ?eval if (false) {} else {} else {}
[05:02:08] <xec> detailiffanu: else *does* require an if
[05:02:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[05:02:11] <bot-t> seutje: SyntaxError: syntax error
[05:02:16] <seutje> well look at that
[05:02:22] <detailiffanu> you can write something like { stuff(); } || { anotherstuff(); }
[05:02:25] <detailiffanu> ooooooooooh
[05:02:26] * bencahill gives dr0id a hamburger
[05:02:28] <detailiffanu> I FOUND THE WAY
[05:02:30] <detailiffanu> i can use ||
[05:02:35] <detailiffanu> can't i?
[05:02:36] <xec> lolwut
[05:02:38] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[05:02:43] <Kambfhase> dr0id: wait a few more minutes, i am sure my brain will be fried by then.
[05:02:59] * dr0id waits
[05:03:02] <seutje> I'm so confuzzled about what he's trying to accomplish :(
[05:03:10] <NodeX> me too
[05:03:24] <aaronmcadam> he's trying to write a state machine without realising it NodeX
[05:03:31] <Kambfhase> basically he wants to execute every odd or every even block.
[05:03:38] <detailiffanu> mustgotowork() && { wakeup(); } || { sleepsomemore(); } || { brush_teeth(); } || { sleepsomemore(); } || { putclotheson() } || { wakeup(); } || { drivetowork(); } || { invitesomechicks() }
[05:03:44] <detailiffanu> this should work, shouldn't it?
[05:03:48] <aaronmcadam> would u fuck off with that shit psuedocode lol
[05:03:48] <NodeX> NO
[05:04:00] <xec> what the hell
[05:04:01] <Kambfhase> detailiffanu: eloquentjavascript.net
[05:04:01] <mytoz> :D
[05:04:04] <seutje> what's with the squigly braces?
[05:04:09] <NodeX> if(must() && wankup() &&...
[05:04:17] <NodeX> oops .. wake up not wankup
[05:04:19] <aaronmcadam> lol
[05:04:25] <NodeX> bash.org ftw
[05:04:27] <detailiffanu> NodeX: || executed only if previous block wasn't run
[05:04:28] <seutje> haha
[05:04:31] <detailiffanu> so actually else == ||
[05:04:34] <NodeX> NO
[05:04:37] <NodeX> || == OR
[05:04:41] <xec> rofl
[05:04:41] <detailiffanu> else == OR
[05:04:47] <seutje> ?eval false || true
[05:04:50] <bot-t> seutje: true
[05:04:52] <NodeX> no else == else
[05:04:57] <detailiffanu> NodeX: why?
[05:05:01] <aaronmcadam> else is not the same, else is more like a finally block in a try/catch
[05:05:04] <dr0id> ?eval false && true
[05:05:06] <NodeX> bedcause trhat's the language constructor
[05:05:06] <bot-t> dr0id: false
[05:05:06] <seutje> coz eric said so!
[05:05:21] <detailiffanu> what the difference between if ( cond() ) { stuff(); } else { stuff(); }
[05:05:21] <seutje> brendan*
[05:05:24] <NodeX> flase && true == false
[05:05:28] <NodeX> false **
[05:05:32] <xec> detailiffanu: if you do something like one() || two() || three()  and one() returns true, only one() will execute afaik
[05:05:32] <detailiffanu> and cond() && { stuff() ; } || {stuff2();}
[05:05:34] <detailiffanu> ?
[05:05:39] <NodeX> it's because binary counting of off == 1
[05:05:40] <aaronmcadam> that's invalid
[05:05:43] <NodeX> and 0 = on
[05:05:44] <Kambfhase> damn you detailiffanu, now you bored even bot-t and HE IS A BOT!
[05:05:47] <mytoz> that's not even syntactically correct
[05:05:50] <seutje> again, what's with the squigly braces?
[05:05:56] <aaronmcadam> xec you're perfectly right
[05:05:59] <mytoz> it's brainbarfitis
[05:06:02] <detailiffanu> mytoz: well in php it works
[05:06:10] <NodeX> No it doesnt work in PHP
[05:06:14] <mytoz> :D
[05:06:16] <NodeX> lol
[05:06:21] <detailiffanu> NodeX: mysql_connect(...) || die();
[05:06:24] <detailiffanu> works
[05:06:25] <aaronmcadam> lol
[05:06:30] <NodeX> omfg
[05:06:32] <seutje> erm
[05:06:34] <NodeX> complete different context
[05:06:36] <aaronmcadam> yes that's a very simple little statement
[05:06:44] <NodeX> and ... || == or
[05:06:47] <seutje> r u trying to disprove ur own point? o.O
[05:06:50] <detailiffanu> NodeX: mysql_connect(...) || die() || dosomestuff()
[05:06:51] <NodeX> mysql_connetc() or die()
[05:06:51] <detailiffanu> works too
[05:06:52] <aaronmcadam> your stupid inception bullshit is very different
[05:06:53] <seutje> I'm even more confuzzled now
[05:07:05] <NodeX> It wont work
[05:07:12] <NodeX> because it will allways DIE()
[05:07:17] <detailiffanu> NodeX: mysql_connect(...) || die() || echo 'CONNECT OK!' || die('WTF not dead?' die!!!')
[05:07:20] <NodeX> it will never reach the end
[05:07:21] <xec> detailiffanu: when would dosomestuff() execute??
[05:07:22] <seutje> s'ok, php should die anyway
[05:07:23] <aaronmcadam> surely it will die first yeah
[05:07:36] <detailiffanu> xec: when die() won't
[05:07:38] <NodeX> if it connects it will skip die()
[05:07:39] <xec> detailiffanu: no, that will not work
[05:07:42] <detailiffanu> why?
[05:07:50] <detailiffanu> NodeX: well it shou ldn't
[05:07:50] <aaronmcadam> if any of those statements are false, it will return false
[05:07:54] <NodeX> but it wont do a 3 way OR
[05:07:59] <detailiffanu> NodeX: why?
[05:08:03] <seutje> did any1 start timing this circlejerk from the start? wonder how long it'll last in total
[05:08:08] <NodeX> because that's the language constructor in PHP
[05:08:14] <seutje> oh right, logs!
[05:08:17] <aaronmcadam> lol :D
[05:08:27] <mytoz> the flow is perfect
[05:08:30] <detailiffanu> +1
[05:08:40] <NodeX> it would go in an infinate loop and leak memory all over the place
[05:08:43] <mytoz> I am hereby swayed by detailiffanu's perfect pseudo code
[05:08:44] <xec> detailiffanu: the echo eill never execute, if mysql connects it will return true and not execture rest of the line
[05:08:48] <xec> will*
[05:08:55] <NodeX> it's an XOR iirc
[05:08:57] <xec> execute*
[05:08:58] <Kambfhase> one hour already ;)
[05:08:59] <detailiffanu> xec: i just tested it
[05:09:04] <aaronmcadam> yeah was thinkin that
[05:09:08] <mytoz> you're not open minded enough to appreciate detailiffanu's brilliance
[05:09:27] <aaronmcadam> yeah let's talk about something constructive
[05:09:29] <NodeX> Right i'm gonna test this in PHP to shut this down lol
[05:09:34] <Kambfhase> someone make a proposal for ES6 please.
[05:09:49] <xec> and file a bug report
[05:09:50] <aaronmcadam> u guys seen this?
[05:09:50] <aaronmcadam> http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[05:09:55] <mytoz> Kambfhase: will it allow for multiple else conditionals?
[05:10:04] <aaronmcadam> haha mtoz shhh
[05:10:14] <Kambfhase> yeah, else after else blocks.
[05:10:19] <NodeX> tbh it could be done in a try catch with some clever cdode
[05:10:24] <NodeX> code*
[05:10:32] <aaronmcadam> but yeah, I'd whack anyone round the head
[05:10:40] <aaronmcadam> for writing code like that haha
[05:11:32] <aaronmcadam> jq 1.7 beta2 out :D
[05:11:33] <mytoz> Kambfhase: I hope they add the maybe keyword
[05:11:33] <Kambfhase> i think this is a case for: https://twitter.com/#!/assbad_js
[05:11:36] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from assbad_js: real pros use new $.fn.init( elem) instead of $( elem) #jQuery ★ http://bit.ly/oDaVGd
[05:11:50] <mytoz> Kambfhase: if (maybe wakeup()) { ... }
[05:12:04] <inad922> hello
[05:12:33] <Kambfhase> socialhapy: everyone likes $.fn.init() !
[05:13:09] <NodeX> detailiffanu : http://pastebin.com/gf6XKBT4 <---- wont even compile
[05:13:18] <inad922> I'm getting this -> "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=nationalrailenq&p=1&rpp=6. Origin http://127.0.0.1 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." error message when trying to use an ajax call with the twitter REST API. Anyone might have a guess what can be the problem. I already  tried adding Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*' to the headers but nothing changed..
[05:13:26] <NodeX> so your mysql_... theory is total rubbish like we all knew
[05:13:51] <aaronmcadam> ?sop @ inad922
[05:14:00] <aaronmcadam> ah fuck
[05:14:02] <aaronmcadam> bot's gone
[05:14:05] <inad922> ?
[05:14:07] <inad922> :)
[05:14:19] <NodeX> the bot died trying to compile that js lol
[05:14:20] <xec> NodeX: maybe remove the semicolons behind a() and die()?
[05:14:22] <aaronmcadam> are u on chrome
[05:14:31] <inad922> yeah
[05:14:35] <inad922> 13.x.y
[05:14:38] <aaronmcadam> it's very strict
[05:14:39] <NodeX> xec : ?
[05:14:42] <aaronmcadam> that's an old version
[05:14:47] <aaronmcadam> update
[05:14:52] <inad922> okay
[05:15:06] <aaronmcadam> there are workarounds u shud be using
[05:15:11] <aaronmcadam> rather than the header hack
[05:15:33] <aaronmcadam> have a look at YQL
[05:15:56] <slavabulgakov> how to hide the bottom scrollbar?
[05:16:07] <NodeX> overflow-x:hidden
[05:16:08] <bjensen> whats the url of the site where you can test jquery snippets?
[05:16:15] <bjensen> share them as well etc
[05:16:28] <bjensen> jsfiddle
[05:16:31] <bjensen> thanks :D
[05:16:41] <aaronmcadam> inad922: http://net.tutsplus.com/tag/yql/
[05:17:50] <slavabulgakov> NodeX: thanks!
[05:18:03] <inad922> hmm now it's chromium 14.0.835.202-1 and I get the same error
[05:18:11] <aaronmcadam> don't do it that way
[05:18:13] <aaronmcadam> use YQL
[05:18:17] <aaronmcadam> look at those links
[05:18:19] <xec> NodeX: nevermind, || does not work in php like it does in js. what would work is: a() or die();
[05:18:40] <xec> NodeX: i.e. "or" not "||", and only once
[05:18:42] <NodeX> xec lol I was proving a point to that troll
[05:20:21] <inad922> aaronmcadam: What's this yql?
[05:21:51] <inad922> aaronmcadam: Is there now way to this this with jquery?
[05:22:03] <inad922> btw it doesn't work in firefox either
[05:22:05] <aaronmcadam> it's cross domain
[05:22:09] <aaronmcadam> of course it doesn't
[05:22:17] <aaronmcadam> same origin policy
[05:22:18] <detailiffanu> NodeX: compiles fine here
[05:22:19] <aaronmcadam> ?bot
[05:22:24] <NodeX> that is a lie
[05:22:58] <detailiffanu> NodeX: you just need to remove ;
[05:23:03] <detailiffanu> and it works perfectly
[05:23:18] <detailiffanu> NodeX: why would you want such code anyway?
[05:23:31] <NodeX> wow you are a troll
[05:23:36] <detailiffanu> ?
[05:23:40] <detailiffanu> maybe you are
[05:23:58] <NodeX> a() || die() || echo("I got here"); doesn compile either
[05:24:16] <NodeX> you said that mysql_connect() || die() || echo("blah"); works
[05:24:20] <NodeX> and it evidently doesntr
[05:24:36] <uhwo> can you just kick that troll out of here :P
[05:25:10] <detailiffanu> NodeX: sure, because there is no such function as a()
[05:25:28] <NodeX> function a() {return true;}
[05:25:33] <detailiffanu> ah
[05:25:39] <detailiffanu> well you screwed it somewhere
[05:25:43] <detailiffanu> maybe i see full code?
[05:26:00] <xec> lol
[05:26:01] <NodeX> yer my 8+ years experiencec in PHP is screwed with a simple 3 line sof code
[05:26:19] <detailiffanu> NodeX: if it doesn't work - it is screwed.
[05:26:37] <NodeX> forget that the sites I huild get 1 million uniques a day .. it must be my code because of course you are correct
[05:26:40] <NodeX> build*
[05:26:56] <detailiffanu> NodeX: so you are telling your code is correct?
[05:27:03] <detailiffanu> you are telling that PHP has a bug?
[05:27:26] <xec> detailiffanu: the whole point of the code was that it did not work....
[05:27:30] <diverdude> I am appending a list item to a ul. The list is embedded in a div with overflow scroll. How do i focus on the newly appended li?
[05:27:33] <NodeX> detailiffanu : you are just trolling .. go bug another chan
[05:27:36] <detailiffanu> xec: yes, that's what i'm telling him
[05:27:48] <xec> detailiffanu: and he's right. it does not
[05:27:59] <detailiffanu> NodeX: lol, sure, but you show us non-working code and tell us it works and not a troll?
[05:28:10] <detailiffanu> xec: well why doesn'\t he agree that he screwed it?
[05:28:21] <detailiffanu> 15:37:38         NodeX | yer my 8+ years experiencec in PHP is screwed with a simple 3 line sof code
[05:28:25] <NodeX> the code I pasted both times DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE PHP WONT COMPILE IT BECAUSE IT'S BAD SYNTAX
[05:28:38] <detailiffanu> NodeX: but why do you write such syntax that does not work?
[05:28:41] <uhwo> Either you're a retard or a troll. Either way could you please just shut up :P
[05:28:45] <NodeX> because a() || b() || c() is BAD SYNTAX
[05:28:48] <detailiffanu> yeah
[05:28:55] <detailiffanu> NodeX: yes, so why do you write like that?
[05:29:09] <NodeX> Kid you will have no intyerenet in a min .. just be quiet
[05:29:17] <detailiffanu> what
[05:29:27] <NodeX> well your BNC wont anyway
[05:29:31] <detailiffanu> what's intyerenet?
[05:29:36] <detailiffanu> what bnc?
[05:29:59] <NodeX> BNC is your bad linode VPS that you are hiding behind
[05:30:01] <stodge> Having a problem with my login form using jquery mobile. I'm using Django on the server side, so when the login form is submitted, django redirects the user to the mobile home page. I can click through a couple of pages using nested lists, but the home button jquery button adds to my header points to junk because the url is all screwed up after the login. Any ideas how to fix this? Thanks
[05:30:09] <diverdude> anyone?
[05:30:10] <detailiffanu> NodeX: hiding? lol. from who?
[05:30:18] <detailiffanu> NodeX: and stay on topic please.
[05:30:18] <NodeX> diverdude : can you jsfiddle your code ?
[05:30:27] <NodeX> Ignored
[05:30:36] <detailiffanu> diverdude: don't listen to him, he's been trolling here for hours already
[05:30:51] <diverdude> NodeX, hmm its a big code
[05:30:58] <NodeX> just the append bit ?
[05:30:58] <diverdude> detailiffanu, his a troll?
[05:31:01] <detailiffanu> yes
[05:31:03] <detailiffanu> don't feed
[05:31:07] <diverdude> ok
[05:31:08] <NodeX> yer .. ignore him, he is a bad kid
[05:31:15] <detailiffanu> NodeX: very funny
[05:31:28] <NodeX> someone bored who has nothing better to do than annoy, troll and touch up little children
[05:31:44] <detailiffanu> and post non-working code
[05:31:53] <Kambfhase> detailiffanu: if you send Brendan Eich this proposal: http://pastebin.com/gfu4fZTx you might be able to use else-selse blokcs in the future!
[05:32:05] <detailiffanu> Kambfhase: i need them now, not in the future
[05:32:07] <NodeX> hahahaha
[05:32:36] <Kambfhase> detailiffanu: better tell him its urgent, then!
[05:33:10] <detailiffanu> lol
[05:35:41] <computer2000> is there any cool way to make php/mysql queries from within js?
[05:36:14] <detailiffanu> computer2000: yes
[05:36:23] <computer2000> detailiffanu: cool
[05:36:25] <NodeX> nope
[05:36:32] <computer2000> NodeX: not cool
[05:36:37] <NodeX> and you wouldn't really want to
[05:36:37] <detailiffanu> computer2000: NodeX is a troll, don't feed
[05:36:48] <NodeX> extremely insecure
[05:37:02] <computer2000> NodeX: doesnt matter. school prototype
[05:37:06] <NodeX> you can have JS call a PHP page with variables
[05:37:10] <computer2000> detailiffanu: can u tell me more?
[05:37:15] <detailiffanu> sure
[05:37:27] <NodeX> computer2000 @: dont listen to a word he says .. he is a troll
[05:37:33] <detailiffanu> haha
[05:37:39] <detailiffanu> computer2000: everybody ignored him already
[05:37:48] <computer2000> man
[05:38:03] <NodeX> just type /ignore detailiffanu
[05:38:10] <NodeX> and press enter ;)
[05:38:13] <computer2000> NodeX: cant i somehow directly include the php script in js?
[05:38:14] <detailiffanu> not funny
[05:38:23] <detailiffanu> computer2000: he's a troll ...
[05:38:26] <NodeX> you can echo a PHP variable to js
[05:38:34] <detailiffanu> he feeds here for hours already
[05:38:38] <detailiffanu> NodeX: LOL
[05:38:42] <detailiffanu> ok you're obvious.
[05:38:48] <NodeX> <script> var a='<?php echo("Foobar"); ?>'; </script>
[05:39:14] <computer2000> ah sure that should work
[05:39:33] <NodeX> what do you need to do exactly .. perhaps we have done it before ?
[05:39:48] <computer2000> NodeX: i need to query my database...
[05:40:19] <NodeX> use $.ajax(); and send it to a php on your server
[05:40:27] <alex88> hi guys, i think it's a stupid error, why on #carousel-cloud the click event is not fired? http://test.datacollab.it/
[05:40:28] <detailiffanu> no, ajax is buggy
[05:40:31] <NodeX> have php do the query and send back the results ;)
[05:40:50] <detailiffanu> NodeX: he wasn't asking about how to do it with php
[05:40:56] <detailiffanu> he was asking about doing it with js
[05:41:00] <detailiffanu> please stop trolling
[05:41:01] <computer2000> NodeX: detailiffanu: best friends?
[05:41:09] <detailiffanu> computer2000: he is a troll
[05:41:17] <detailiffanu> and i'm - antitroll, i defend users here
[05:41:37] <computer2000> im neutral man
[05:41:41] <uhwo> Can someone please kick detailiffanu out of here?
[05:41:49] <detailiffanu> uhwo: why? o.O
[05:41:59] <NodeX> detailiffanu is a bad kid computer2000 ... just trolling and generaly annoying people
[05:42:09] <uhwo> Because you're an ass.
[05:42:12] <detailiffanu> lol, no, NodeX it is you
[05:42:20] <NodeX> I ignored him so I can't see what he is typing lol
[05:42:20] <detailiffanu> uhwo: no, you just listened to NodeX too much
[05:42:26] <computer2000> lol
[05:42:54] <Kambfhase> Anti -Troll? is that like Anti-Matter? And if you two touch, are you gonna implode?
[05:44:09] <computer2000> probably
[05:45:48] <detailiffanu> Kambfhase: the purpose of antitrolls is to track down trolls and eliminate them by making anybody ignore them
[05:46:54] <Kambfhase> http://www.google.de/search?q=troll+police
[05:47:21] <NodeX> http://trollpolice.com/
[05:47:22] <NodeX> haha
[05:48:05] <Rocket_In_My_Poc> ji
[05:48:40] <computer2000> look: i have three ul's with items in it. they are populated by mysql queries. now, when i select an item, i want the other ul's to filter out the items depending on what was selected. so i need to query again, as soon as a element has been selected. thats my problem
[05:49:24] <Kambfhase> ?load @ computer2000
[05:49:32] <Kambfhase> darn bot.
[05:49:48] <Kambfhase> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[05:49:59] <Kambfhase> Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element.
[05:50:27] <NodeX> anyone recommend a good scalable NAS storage for home use
[05:50:30] <computer2000> Kambfhase: can i pass a mysql query? can i use the existing connection from my php document or must i connect again from within js?
[05:50:32] <Rocket_In_My_Poc> why don't you use auto complete
[05:51:43] <NodeX> computer2000 : none of the above
[05:51:58] <Rocket_In_My_Poc> nodex how about netgear stora
[05:52:07] <computer2000> NodeX: what then?
[05:52:12] <NodeX> had one before .. they require shitty driversw
[05:52:32] <NodeX> use an $.ajax() request to do the work and spit out the results
[05:54:04] <halcyon1234> In $(":radio").click(function() {} ), can I determine which Radio Button was checked before the click, or is that state information I need to manually track elsewhere?
[05:54:52] <NodeX> in your function do ..$(":radio:checked")..
[05:55:33] <Kambfhase> its :selected for radio buttons, isn't it?
[05:55:46] <NodeX> is it ?
[05:56:38] <NodeX> it's checked
[05:56:57] <NodeX> i just checked (pun intended) :P
[05:57:20] <quicksilver> if ( $(this).is(':checked') ) { ... }
[05:57:42] <NodeX> he want's the current checked one quicksilver
[05:57:50] <halcyon1234> That doesn't seem to work, because the browser switches the check before the click handler fires. I can easily tell which radio is currently checked (ie: the one that was just clicked on), but not the one that used to be checked.
[05:57:51] <NodeX> adn $(this) is out of scope
[05:57:52] <halcyon1234> http://jsfiddle.net/ABGPA/3/
[05:58:07] <NodeX> right, I get you now lol
[05:58:40] <quicksilver> NodeX: oh :)
[05:58:55] <quicksilver> NodeX: this woul dhave been in scope iside the click handler. But I did indeed misread his question.
[05:58:58] <NodeX> you need to track that elsewhere
[05:59:28] <NodeX> track it inside the same code halcyon1234 : and at the start set the var of the current checked one
[05:59:50] <halcyon1234> NodeX: No problem, just didn't want to duplicate an existing function. I had a feeling. Thanks for the confirmation.
[06:01:55] <m4xx> i've got a function that makes a curl request to an outside resource. it can take up to a minute to complete. if i visit the page in firefox it works splendidly, when i try it in IE it seems like it times out after 30 seconds or so. I've set_time_limit(300), ini_set('max_execution_time', 300), send a keep-alive header and tried sending a \n and  ob_flush(). Not sure what else to try
[06:02:37] <m4xx> any ideas?
[06:02:44] <NodeX> err ask in ##php lol
[06:02:50] <daleharvey> is there some shorthand for if (someboolean) { obj.addClass('class'); } else { obj.removeClass('class'); }
[06:02:52] <m4xx> did
[06:02:53] <m4xx> ;[
[06:03:24] <m4xx> i think it's a browser issue honestly
[06:03:26] <NodeX> what sort of flushing are you doing ?
[06:03:37] <NodeX> can you pastebin the flush code
[06:03:47] <detailiffanu> m4xx: fz ?
[06:03:48] <m4xx> echo "\n";ob_flush();
[06:03:49] <m4xx> lol
[06:03:54] <detailiffanu> ;[[[
[06:03:58] <m4xx> detailiffanu: fz?
[06:04:00] <NodeX> try a few more lines
[06:04:04] <detailiffanu> m4xx: fz
[06:04:06] <NodeX> m4xx : ignore him
[06:04:10] <catcatcat> hi there, im very neew to jquery trying to build my own plugin. here is the code: http://pastebin.com/9Pu4KXi2 i am trying to add options to it now. i copy the code  for options from jqury api. my question is , how can i use the default and options  in the code?
[06:04:10] <detailiffanu> he talked ;[[[[[[ often
[06:04:16] <m4xx> ignored ;]
[06:04:20] <detailiffanu> catcatcat: hi. what does 'neew' mean?
[06:04:29] <detailiffanu> m4xx: lol, ignore him
[06:04:31] <NodeX> try about 6 lines and see if it makes a difference
[06:04:45] <bLUEE> hi there.. in a $.get('myPage.php', function(response){..});  how do i specify the return datatype to html ?
[06:04:47] <catcatcat> sorry typo: 'new'
[06:05:07] <NodeX> bLUEE it's defautled to html iirc
[06:05:16] <Kambfhase> neew neew!
[06:05:18] <xec> daleharvey: you can use ternary operator
[06:05:25] <m4xx> same effect
[06:05:33] <bLUEE> NodeX when i do this: alert("type of response:" + typeof response); <- says string
[06:05:37] <NodeX> daleharvey : there is also toggleClass
[06:05:41] <NodeX> ?toggleClass
[06:05:41] <xec> daleharvey: someboolean ? doIfTrue() : doIfFalse();
[06:06:05] <NodeX> it's a string  .. if you send it html it's html
[06:06:15] <NodeX> json is still a string until it's evaluated
[06:06:56] <NodeX> ** Json in a response that is
[06:07:12] <detailiffanu> what happened to bot?
[06:07:30] <daleharvey> heh yeh, I see code littered with obj[((boolean) ? 'add' : 'remove') + 'Class']('class'); tag ugly though
[06:07:36] <xec> daleharvey: and like NodeX says, .toggleClass() accepts a second parameter
[06:07:47] <bLUEE> NodeX, but i am calling a page i.e. $.get('MyPage.php') .. and typeof is giving me string. but in $.get how can i tell it to expect html ?
[06:08:00] <NodeX> catcatcat : settings.pagination ...
[06:08:10] <xec> daleharvey: like, .toggleClass("classname", someboolean);
[06:08:14] <detailiffanu> bLUEE: $.get('MyPage.php?type=html')
[06:08:21] <NodeX> the extend just merged options into settings as an object
[06:08:22] <daleharvey> toogleClass is exactly what I meant though, cheers
[06:09:10] <BrokenCog> hello ... can anyone throw a link to a good simple implementation of an list expansion via RoR/jQuery?
[06:09:32] <BrokenCog> [list expansion: click the little plus to get a big list thingy]
[06:09:43] <detailiffanu> BrokenCog: RoR is deprecated
[06:09:52] <detailiffanu> use RawRRR
[06:10:16] <BrokenCog> lol.
[06:10:19] <BrokenCog> okay.
[06:10:24] <detailiffanu> google it
[06:10:49] <BrokenCog> I did ... hence my question for a link to a concise working tutorial/example.
[06:10:54] <m4xx> adding header("keep-alive: timeout=60, max=100"); seems to fix my issue
[06:11:08] <NodeX> i-e keep alive sucks
[06:11:12] <orl> Hi!
[06:11:32] <catcatcat> NodeX: cool thank, but when i call my plugin like this: $('#slider').shivaSlider(false); it still return setting.pagination as true!
[06:11:39] <orl> I've got a problem using .ajax() to load a page on which there are some audio/video markups.
[06:12:00] <NodeX> that's because its ... shivaSlider({pagination:false})
[06:12:06] <m4xx> NodeX: it's more than keep alive that makes IE suck ;x
[06:12:09] <NodeX> options is a json object :)
[06:12:20] <orl> When rendering the page straightly from url bar: http://www.sebkhachott.net/spip/?rubrique43 no problem, the page works fine, and everything is fast.
[06:12:21] <NodeX> m4xx : true
[06:12:24] <catcatcat> i see thanks alot :)
[06:12:51] <orl> When calling this page through .ajax(), it's just like preload="none" was avoid, and the page takes many time to display
[06:12:56] <catcatcat> yeey worked !!! :D
[06:13:11] <orl> for that scond option: www.sebkhachott.net/spip and then clic on the "Pornogram" link in the menu (that big circle on the left)
[06:13:17] <BrokenCog> detailiff: what are those things even called in javascript?  the "plus signs which expand into a list" ??
[06:13:43] <detailiffanu> BrokenCog: squitters
[06:13:46] <NodeX> BrokenCog : dont even listen to him
[06:13:48] <NodeX> he is a troll
[06:13:51] <detailiffanu> lol stfu
[06:14:11] <detailiffanu> where did i troll?
[06:14:13] <NodeX> BrokenCog : http://jquery.bassistance.de/treeview/demo/
[06:14:15] <detailiffanu> stop talking nonsense
[06:14:37] <BrokenCog> thanks ... that's it.
[06:14:45] <detailiffanu> no problem
[06:15:12] <BrokenCog> detailiff: hey you, go roar under  tree.
[06:15:24] <NodeX> hehe
[06:17:54] <detailiffanu> BrokenCog: what do you mean?
[06:18:02] <detailiffanu> i don't 'roar', i am human being
[06:18:41] <BrokenCog> detailiff: um, right, okay ... go RawRRRR then.
[06:20:04] <clasificado> hi i'm learning some jquery and i dont understand this use of the $ function
[06:20:20] <clasificado> view-source:http://d2o0t5hpnwv4c1.cloudfront.net/377_slider/slider_sourcefiles/slider.html
[06:20:29] <clasificado> var conveyor = $(".content-conveyor", $("#sliderContent"))
[06:20:36] <NodeX> $ = a shortcut for jquery
[06:20:36] <hiryu_> hello
[06:20:40] <clasificado> yes
[06:20:47] <clasificado> but they are passing two parameterrs
[06:21:17] <NodeX> var conveyor = $(".content-conveyor", $("#sliderContent")) = get me all the elements with a classname of content-conveyor inside the element of id="sliderContent"
[06:21:38] <clasificado> THANKS a LOT
[06:21:50] <hiryu_> i need to scroll with mouse pointer, what i can use?
[06:22:05] <NodeX> the second part is a context clasificado
[06:22:08] <amcsi_work> hello
[06:23:14] <stodge> I think jquery mobile is not respecting data-ajax=false on my form
[06:23:37] <amcsi_work> what's the pattern for making a $.Deferred such that it will only begin to collect the resources necessary to resolve it when the first call to .then(), .done() or .fail() is called?
[06:29:45] <amcsi_work> would .when(function) work?
[06:30:13] <amcsi_work> or does Deferred not support this and I have to completely make my own implementation?
[06:30:52] <amcsi_work> what I want to do with this is lazy load .js files
[06:32:13] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> amcsi_work: you shouldn't be lazy
[06:32:36] <amcsi_work> not all js files. Just heavy ones
[06:33:16] <amcsi_work> there's like a popup gallery one that is used on line one page only. I don't want to load its js file on every page, because it's unnecessary
[06:35:23] <NodeX> can someone +b this fool
[06:35:37] <NodeX> ( `sudo_kill_1_-9` )
[06:35:40] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> ?
[06:35:48] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> hi NodeX
[06:35:54] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> how can i help you?
[06:36:05] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> hm
[06:36:21] <NodeX> `sudo_kill_1_-9` is ~arch@unaffiliated/detailiffanu * -.- .. quit trolling
[06:36:29] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> where was i trolling?
[06:36:36] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> drop your accusations please
[06:43:25] <ajpiano> amcsi_work: yes you can do $.when( $.getScript("foo"), $.getScript("bar") ).then(fn)
[06:45:05] <amcsi_work> ah, and if I run when again with the same parameters, it won't load the script files twice, right?
[06:45:15] <soee> any idea why this: $(':input[@name="redakcja"]') has effect on all inputs not only those with name "redakcja">?
[06:45:41] <NodeX> isn't it just [name=... rather than @ ?
[06:48:09] <nickadeemus2002> $(input[name=redakcja])
[06:48:41] <kborchers> nickadeemus2002: missing some quotes there
[06:49:18] <nickadeemus2002> sorry : )     -->  $('input[name=redakcja]')
[06:49:21] <kborchers> $("input[name='redakcja']")
[06:49:37] <kPb_in> hey guys.. I have iframe from different domain.. I want to get content of that Iframe.. how can i do that?
[06:51:02] <ajpiano> amcsi_work: not sure, it depends on the params of your ajax request
[06:51:09] <ajpiano> i think getScript is intentionally cache-busting
[06:51:24] <amcsi_work> I mean on the same page
[06:51:35] <amcsi_work> if I call getScript with the same params twice
[06:52:08] <bLUEE> hi there: I am specifying HTML return on this $.get() but the typeof always comes back as string? http://pastebin.com/AAyQQDVA any ideas ?
[06:52:30] <ajpiano> amcsi_work: i think it will make the requests multiple times because getScript appends a timestamp param to bust the cache
[06:52:51] <Kambfhase> bLUEE: your string is valid HTML. there is no native HTML type in JS.
[06:52:55] <ajpiano> but you can do $.ajax({ cache: true, dataType: "script" }) i assume to avoid that
[06:53:21] <amcsi_work> because for lazy loading, my script would look something like this: if (somethingThatMyBeTrue) { lazyLoad('somescript.js', function () { ... }); } ... if (somethingElseThatMayBeTrue) { lazyLoad('somescript.js', function () { ... }); }
[06:53:35] <bLUEE> Kambfhase oh i see.
[06:54:31] <hay> hi all... I am having a simple div in which I $('#div_id').load(divUrl) load URL... after I call this function and open the url successfully, the resize buttons disappear in the DIV, but I can still move it... what should I do to keep resizability available for this DIV? tia
[06:54:37] <deadiam> hi
[06:55:05] <cruxst> hay: resize buttons?
[06:55:13] <cruxst> hay: scrollbars?
[06:55:17] <Kambfhase> hay: load within a sub div of #div_id
[06:55:29] <deadiam> is there any way we can position texts in a div based on the words?
[06:55:32] <hay> cruxst, that "button" in the lower right corner of the div...
[06:55:37] <detrate> how can I shortern this statement? I want to get children of a jQuery object but it only seems to be working if I use multiple .children() ;   console.log(plugin.el.children(plugin.settings.tpagerClass).children("ul").children("li").children("a").length);
[06:55:44] <detrate> where ideally, I'd like to be able to "ul li a"
[06:56:06] <hay> Kambfhase, I see... thanks... will try that
[06:56:18] <Kambfhase> detrate: .find() ?
[06:56:26] <bastetmilo> Hi, how can I find and replace string? It could be between <a /> or <span /> ???
[06:56:33] <detrate> awesome Kambfhase, thanks
[06:56:39] <deadiam> hi
[06:56:45] <bLUEE> Kambfhase, the problem is that i can see all my html in firebug, the response is correct, but when i try and select things out of the response. it comes back NULL. alert($("#moreLink", response).html());
[06:56:46] <deadiam> no answers for me?
[06:56:56] <Kambfhase> deadiam: chill, dude.
[06:57:07] <cruxst> hay: what Kambfhase said, load your content in an inner div, like $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#div_id').append('<div />').children().first().load(divUrl)
[06:57:16] <Aquaguy> Im not so sure but since it usesncss selectors shouldnt it be ul, li, a?
[06:57:26] <hay> cruxst, thanks :)
[06:57:33] <deadiam> yeah....i am chilling
[06:57:51] <Kambfhase> bLUEE: try: $response = $(response); $response.find('#moreLinkL).html() ...
[06:57:52] <Aquaguy> detrate: .children(ul, li, a)
[06:58:07] <Kambfhase> ... like that but with less typos
[06:58:12] <Aquaguy> might work
[06:58:30] <amcsi_work> does anyone use lightBox? How do I make it so the navigation button image links get a prefix for their relative image links?
[06:58:53] <Kambfhase> Aquaguy: a comma is an or. but he wants a within li within ul
[06:58:57] <amcsi_work> I'm using slash separation for my website, and the lightBox imgs point to images/<image>
[06:59:11] <BrokenCog> NodeX: thanks for the tree sample link.  any idea how I can have the original value of the span remain after explanding/collapsing ? it comes from a <%= %> function ...
[06:59:14] <Aquaguy> oh ok
[06:59:38] <quicksilver> detrate just wants "ul > li> a" doesn't he?
[07:00:15] <Aquaguy> using css then is ul > li just as quicksilver said
[07:00:30] <deadiam> anyone know how to position words in a div?
[07:00:31] <Kambfhase> deadiam: so, back to your question. what do you want to do?
[07:00:41] <bLUEE> Kambfhase, thanks :/ but still NULL
[07:01:05] <Kambfhase> there is no NULL in JS.
[07:01:11] <deadiam> Kambfhase: thanks, i want to position certain words in a div without using any tag for them , is that possible?
[07:01:23] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> Kambfhase: um, there is.
[07:01:23] <Kambfhase> highly doubt it.
[07:01:27] <deadiam> words- keywords
[07:01:41] <bLUEE> Kambfhase, alert($response.find('#moreLink').html()); gives "null"
[07:01:44] <Kambfhase> there is null, but not NULL
[07:01:47] <deadiam> for mking a editor
[07:02:07] <Kambfhase> bLUEE: did you check if your HTML is correct?
[07:02:09] <antihero> Can I use animate() on background-color somehow?
[07:02:18] <rgr> wtf? The latest version of google chrome isnt correcntly rendering german characters. iceweasel, firefox etc all working fine.
[07:02:33] <Kambfhase> rgr: link, pics?
[07:02:41] <ajpiano> antihero: yes, but you have to grab the color plugin
[07:02:45] <ajpiano> ?g jquery color plugin github
[07:03:03] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[07:03:13] <rgr> Int he source : "Das Shamrock besteht fÃ¼r mehr als 25 Jahre!"
[07:03:42] <bLUEE> Kambfhase here is the response, and the js : http://jsfiddle.net/JbFCn/
[07:03:44] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> rgr: only english is allowed here
[07:03:59] <rgr> IÄll assume that idiotic remark was a bot.
[07:04:02] <Kambfhase> rgr: make sure your server send the correct encoding & header.
[07:04:14] <rgr> it is : it works fine in older chrome, firefox etc.
[07:04:16] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> rgr: insulting if forbidden on this channel
[07:04:25] <rgr> Is this sudo guy a troll?
[07:04:36] <Kambfhase> Dummheit sollte auch verboten werden. m(
[07:04:51] <rgr> heh. I'll dig deeper.
[07:05:06] <ajpiano> kborchers: wao, he changed his nick
[07:05:09] <ajpiano> PROFESSIONALISM
[07:05:55] <kborchers> yep
[07:05:59] <wao> ?
[07:06:16] <bLUEE> Kambfhase i dont get why it cant find that id
[07:06:53] <Kambfhase> bLUEE: hah, use .filter() instead of .find()
[07:07:49] <computer2000> how can i remove a class from all elements which contain it?
[07:08:07] <computer2000> $('myelement').removeClass('myclass'); doesnt seem to work
[07:08:11] <quicksilver> $('.classname').removeClass('classname')
[07:10:10] <bLUEE> Kambfhase hmm that worked?! how comes filter worked and not find ? or $(obj,response)?
[07:10:54] <Kambfhase> .find() looks ate the children, but your #div_id was at the top level!
[07:11:34] <bLUEE> hm oh that makes fucking perfect sense
[07:11:45] <bLUEE> i wasted 1 day on this.
[07:11:46] <bLUEE> thanks.
[07:12:43] <rgr> Kambfhase: heh. I had moved my content type by mistake. fixed. still worked in FF mind.
[07:13:04] <Kambfhase> and yet another soul saved
[07:14:07] <antihero> how do I make one function interupt another one. Say I have something fading out, but I want to override that and have it fade in?
[07:14:11] <antihero> queues?
[07:15:09] <Kambfhase> .stop(true,true)
[07:15:26] <orl> I've a problem, when loading a webpage with <audio preload="none"> with .ajax(), the audio is prebuffered, whereas when I just load this page from the url bar it doesn't. DOes anybody have an idea about this?
[07:16:14] <rgr> audio.. eek..
[07:16:21] <orl> rgr: what?
[07:16:31] <orl> I could have said <video preload="none"> ! ;)
[07:16:36] <orl> it's the very same
[07:16:36] <rgr> had loads of issues with it, nothing more ;)
[07:16:43] <orl> OK
[07:17:19] <Zerks> ever since I updated jquery from like 1.4 to the latest, jquery tabs is trying to parse ajax-loaded tab data as json before realizing it's html. but for tabs ajaxOptions I set dataType to html so it shouldn't
[07:17:30] <orl> antihero: stop()
[07:17:32] <orl> ?
[07:17:35] <Zerks> and something with that is causing some of the javascript in the response, which is also injected into the dom, to not execute properly
[07:17:40] <Zerks> not even sure what's going on
[07:18:24] <Zerks> (though that's only on firefox with the javascript not working, maybe sometimes opera, and not all users are affected)
[07:19:03] <antihero> orl: Cheers. Any way to have that override a timeout
[07:19:25] <Zerks> I suppose I'll try updating jquery ui
[07:19:37] <orl> just put .stop().thefunction which should stop the other function
[07:20:50] <orl> just to go a bit further, the jQuery .ajax() method I use is there: http://pastebin.com/mj2cTa4f
[07:21:07] <antihero> Hmm, I suppose if I animate it doing nothing instead of using setTImeout
[07:21:30] <orl> antihero: sorry didn't understand
[07:21:40] <ajpiano> orl: stop() is only for stopping in progress animations, it doesn't magically just stop any running function
[07:21:50] <ajpiano> antihero: you can use clearTimeout to cancel an existing timout
[07:22:17] <orl> ajpiano: Zerks was speaking about fade in/out, I thought it worked with it, doesn't it?
[07:22:51] <ajpiano> you thought that it worked with it but it itn't it it it it?
[07:23:11] <ajpiano> stop() stops animations, fadeIn/Out is an animation, yes, it works with it
[07:24:01] <Zerks> hey ajpiano, zerxer here if you remember me. have any idea what my issue may be? :(
[07:24:17] <Accelerator> Is it possible to have jquery "smooth scroll" to the top of a page upon clicking an actual link? Basically, the page scrolls to the top as another page loads (for search results)
[07:24:30] <Zerks> also I don't remember talking about fadein/out unless that was some bad tab completion
[07:24:35] <ajpiano> well, you shouldn't be injecting script in as part of your tab requests
[07:24:39] <ajpiano> :/
[07:25:16] <Zerks> bad practice to have script tags inside html inserted with .html() ?
[07:25:23] <Zerks> it's always worked just fine before
[07:25:27] <aaronmcadam> loool
[07:25:29] <ajpiano> in general yes...
[07:25:51] <Zerks> sounds reasonable
[07:25:51] <ajpiano> what do you mean "execute properly"
[07:25:59] <ajpiano> it either runs or it doesn't... :/
[07:26:12] <aaronmcadam> adam ur on fire today :p
[07:26:27] <dhruvasagar> Hey, in ubuntu 11.10, if I press Alt+Tab it shows me all applications on all workspaces, I would like to ideally limit that to the apps in the current workspace, doesn't it otherwise make using multiple workspaces obsolete ?
[07:26:38] <ajpiano> lol
[07:26:41] <aaronmcadam> wrong channel i'm guessin
[07:26:43] <Zerks> well it works fine in chrome, and for most users on other browsers, but ever since I updated jquery, some users on firefox are having issues so I had one person log some errors and it just says the function (which was in the script tag) doesn't exist when it goes to call it
[07:26:51] <Zerks> though some of the other requests work fine
[07:27:06] <aaronmcadam> dhruvasagar: there is a feature in compiz
[07:27:10] <Zerks> I really don't know since it's not affecting everyone
[07:27:16] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: I am listening
[07:27:18] <dethkrieg> Hey guys, if I have a select (drop-down list) with and id of "mySelect", how do i use JQuery to change which item is currently selected? I'd like to do this based on the value attribute of one of the options
[07:27:18] <aaronmcadam> where you can use the expose feature per workspace
[07:27:40] <ajpiano> Zerks: i don't think stuff that gets eval'd by jquery in that context actually makes it into the global scope
[07:27:49] <NodeX> dethkrieg .. val('something')
[07:27:57] <dethkrieg> will try
[07:27:59] <nail_> Sorry about the off-topic question, but when doing JSON-RPC over HTTP, does it make any sense to send back a 404 status (with the json error in the body) when requesting information about an object that doesn't exist? Shouldn't it be a '200' status along with a relevant json error, according to the specs? I'm not sure how to interpret "successful result" in http://json-rpc.org/wd/JSON-RPC-1-1-WD-20060807.html#ResponseStatusCodes
[07:28:02] <Accelerator> http://pastie.org/2695067 <- This is what I have now, but it doesn't work as intended.
[07:28:17] <Zerks> but also what's up with jquery tabs trying to run e.extend.parseJSON after the tab request?  does it just always do that or should it not since I have ajaxOptions.dataType set to html in the tab options?
[07:28:28] <dethkrieg> NodeX, thank you so much, that worked
[07:28:41] <Zerks> whenever I switch tabs, the console logs errors for "Unexpected token: <" for e.extend.parseJSON
[07:28:43] <aaronmcadam> nail_ i'd use a custom code
[07:29:11] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: could you be a little more specific or detailed ? where do I find it ?
[07:29:17] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: what's it called ?
[07:29:24] <aaronmcadam> dhruvasagar: expose
[07:29:45] <aaronmcadam> try google, it tends to be quite useful in these situations
[07:29:52] <Zerks> I'm fairly certain it never did that before either when on jquery 1.4
[07:30:17] <orl> nobody has any idea about my videos/audios preloading when the page is load through .ajax() and not when load through url bar? (see here www.sebkhachott.net/spip)
[07:30:26] <aaronmcadam> it must be valid json zerks
[07:30:37] <nail_> aaronmcadam: for the json error yes, but I'm using some jsonrpc api that sends 404+json when I request something about an object that doesn't exist, and that sounds wrong to me, so I was wondering if they were right to do it that way
[07:30:48] <Zerks> it's not json, I'm not expecting json as a response, which is why I'm wondering why it's trying to first parse it as json
[07:30:59] <aaronmcadam> oh ur not writing it urself nail_
[07:31:22] <nail_> not the server, I'm writing a client for it
[07:31:25] <aaronmcadam> Zerks: are u setting datatype
[07:31:36] <aaronmcadam> gotcha
[07:31:41] <Zerks> well I suppose to fix the other problem I'll just go find the best way to move the javascript to the main page, just wish I knew why it was only affecting a small amount of users
[07:31:59] <Zerks> aaronmcadam: yeah, setting the tabs option for ajaxOptions.dataType to html
[07:32:08] <aaronmcadam> u shudn't be embedding scripts in ur ajax content
[07:32:24] <Zerks> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#option-ajaxOptions
[07:32:36] <Zerks> setting that's dataType to html so it shouldn't think it's json
[07:32:45] <aaronmcadam> just do it the right way
[07:33:00] <Accelerator> Oi.
[07:33:01] <Zerks> like I said it never did before, only started doing that since I updated jquery (for the trying to parse as json thing)
[07:33:09] <aaronmcadam> and why are u still on jq 1.4?
[07:33:16] <Zerks> I'm not now
[07:33:29] <Zerks> updated a couple of weeks ago
[07:33:33] <aaronmcadam> well obviously ur doing something wrong :)
[07:33:50] <aaronmcadam> means u learn the right way to do stuff :D
[07:33:55] <stodge> Bah even $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false   doesn't work
[07:34:05] <aaronmcadam> stode, #jquerymobile
[07:34:11] <aaronmcadam> stodge but what's up
[07:34:26] <Accelerator> http://www.webdesignshock.com/jquery-slider WOW. Someone has way too much free time on their hands.
[07:34:32] <Zerks> well hang on then
[07:35:03] <aaronmcadam> Accelerator: that's fuckin stupid lol
[07:35:25] <Accelerator> I don't even know if I could Google 200 different sliders
[07:35:30] <cruxst> Accelerator: omg srsly
[07:35:37] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: didn't find anything even in the advanced search, trying to search for something relavant in google but haven't been lucky so far, I don't like the idea that I see apps from all worspaces, is that really absurd !?
[07:35:56] <aaronmcadam> nope I noticed that too
[07:36:10] <Kambfhase> how am i to pick the one slider i need from hte 200?
[07:36:12] <stodge> aaroncadam: Trying to submit a login form without ajax
[07:36:34] <stodge> jqm is ignoring ajax-data="false"  and ajaxEnabled=false
[07:36:34] <Accelerator> People look at the top 10, then the rest of the 190 were a waste of countless hours.
[07:36:38] <Kambfhase> i cant even decide if i am gonna vote for reps or democrats :/
[07:36:44] <aaronmcadam> dhruvasagar: the effect is called Expo
[07:36:55] <aaronmcadam> it's in the compiz settings manager
[07:37:12] <aaronmcadam> stodge: which version
[07:37:25] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: you're not getting what I am asking are you...
[07:37:28] <Accelerator> Kamakazi: Be a rebel and vote for neither
[07:37:37] <stodge> rc1
[07:37:38] <aaronmcadam> dhruvasagar: yeah i am, I wanted the same thing
[07:37:47] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: what expo seems to be telling me that there's a shortcut to zoom back and see all workspaces, that is not what I want
[07:37:53] <stodge> Awww crap wait, I think I'm using the wrong version. bugger
[07:38:24] <Kambfhase> Accelerator: yeah, i am gonna vote for the Pirates!
[07:38:31] <Accelerator> Atta boy!
[07:39:19] <stodge> Damnit - somehow I copied the URLs from an older file with the wrong version
[07:39:22] <deadiam> hi, can i get only the current line content?
[07:39:36] <Accelerator> http://www.tn3gallery.com/ Wow, this one is really nice though.
[07:39:36] <aaronmcadam> stodge
[07:39:41] <aaronmcadam> use the latest
[07:39:43] <aaronmcadam> or test
[07:40:22] <aaronmcadam> stodge: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/04/16/latest/
[07:40:23] <Zerks> aaronmcadam: http://pastebin.com/M9HrKuB4  don't think I'm doing anything wrong (and it never used to throw an error). note that the tab still loads, console just logs that parseJSON failed (shouldn't even be called)
[07:41:00] <aaronmcadam> stodge: make a test case in jsfiddle, and if it still doesn't work right, file an issue here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?sort=created&labels=4+-+High&direction=desc&state=open
[07:41:10] <stodge> Yeah I copied the wrong URLs so I was using a2
[07:41:11] <aaronmcadam> fuck pastebin, jsfiddle is better
[07:41:21] <dhruvasagar> Alt+Tab in ubuntu 11.10 is current showing me apps/windows from all workspaces, I want alt+tab to show apps/windows only from the current workspace. What's the point of having multiple workspaces if alt+tab is going to show you all of the apps anyways!?
[07:41:28] <stodge> But now my back button has disappeared
[07:41:34] <stodge> Ah well at least the login works
[07:41:36] <aaronmcadam> yes yes yes
[07:41:39] <aaronmcadam> chill out dhruvasagar
[07:41:49] <aaronmcadam> ask in #ubuntu or something
[07:41:50] <Zerks> couldn't remember the name of the site, but didn't need all those extra areas anyways
[07:41:55] <aaronmcadam> I'm on mint so it's slightly different
[07:42:05] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: f*ck! I though I was in #ubuntu, sorry
[07:42:09] <Zerks> it's just a few lines of javascript
[07:42:17] <aaronmcadam> u might not Zerks, but *we* do to *help* u
[07:42:17] <Kambfhase> but #ubuntu is written in jQuery, isn't int?
[07:42:26] <aaronmcadam> haha mad cunt
[07:42:43] <aaronmcadam> why did u think we were all talkin bout javascript?
[07:42:57] <Zerks> you don't need all the extra boxes, trust me. but if you really don't want to click a pastebin link, hold on
[07:42:58] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: I didn't read anything
[07:43:13] <dhruvasagar> aaronmcadam: I was just looking for replies
[07:43:21] <Zerks> just trying to show you that I'm not doing it wrong, though
[07:43:21] <aaronmcadam> Zerks the whole point of jsfiddle is the "fiddle" part so we can run ur code
[07:43:29] <aaronmcadam> lol
[07:43:35] <Zerks> http://jsfiddle.net/p4f4G/
[07:43:39] <Zerks> you can't run it though
[07:43:42] <Zerks> I'm not providing you with enough
[07:43:46] <aaronmcadam> yes u can
[07:43:48] <Zerks> I'm just showing you that I'm setting ajaxOptions
[07:43:54] <aaronmcadam> ur not even using fiddle right lol
[07:44:02] <Zerks> yes I know, that's why pastebin was fine
[07:44:12] <aaronmcadam> wow, running 3 functions one after the other in an ajax req
[07:44:14] <aaronmcadam> ur brave
[07:44:42] <Zerks> I'm simply showing you that I'm setting ajaxOptions.dataType to html, and stating it worked fine before getting the latest version of jquery (and I already tested without those functions too just to make sure none of them were causing it)
[07:45:45] <Zerks> I mean it still works fine, I just don't understand why it's trying to run parseJSON. it's really not that  big of an issue but I thought maybe it's a bug with one of the later  versions, like it's ignoring the dataType set by that
[07:46:36] <Zerks> lol well those functions don't interfere with each other so they've always been fine
[07:46:50] <Eviltwin> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#ajax
[07:46:56] <Eviltwin> That doesn't set the data type
[07:47:13] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: do u know of any good concatenation files that might use uglify for minification?
[07:47:31] <ajpiano> still what is a "concatenation file"
[07:47:40] <aaronmcadam> ah shit
[07:47:41] <aaronmcadam> lol
[07:47:48] <aaronmcadam> meant "good tool for"
[07:47:57] <ajpiano> yeah check out smoosh
[07:48:00] <aaronmcadam> I've got uglify on node
[07:48:05] <Zerks> you're right, let's see what happens if I remove the dataType
[07:48:06] <aaronmcadam> ok cool
[07:48:14] <ajpiano> ?g github fat smoosh
[07:48:16] <aaronmcadam> is it on npm?
[07:48:21] <ajpiano> i think so
[07:48:50] <aaronmcadam> awesome!
[07:48:58] <aaronmcadam> thanls ajpiano exactly what i wanted :D
[07:49:06] <Zerks> poor bot-t mia again
[07:49:16] <ajpiano> yeah smoosh is great
[07:49:21] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: your widget site is awesome btw :D you strike again :D
[07:49:44] <Eviltwin> Have you checked your garbage files?
[07:50:23] <rroelofs> Zerks: IIRC, jquery has an intelligent guess method for the data type if you don't specify or the content-type the server sends doesn't match what you specified.
[07:50:53] <Zerks> it does
[07:51:55] <Zerks> hm dataType: 'html' and no dataType still cause the page to try and run parseJSON, but I don't see that error happening on the jqueryui site. I'll dig further, must be overlooking something somewhere else but nothing else should be interfering
[07:52:48] <Eviltwin> Zerks: If only you had made a working jsFiddle
[07:52:59] <Eviltwin> We might have helped you isolate the problem
[07:53:35] <deadiam> how to get the current line texts?
[07:54:16] <Zerks> I didn't think there was a problem anywhere with mine, seemed like it was just something within the latest version ignoring the dataType and still trying json first, but I'll see if I can find anything else in my code that could be doing something and then try to isolate it more
[07:54:50] <stodge> Bah upgrading from a2 to rc1 broke my site
[07:54:55] <deadiam> current line texts?
[07:54:56] <Eviltwin> Zerks: Here we know better than to trust developers's judgements about what's causing a problem
[07:55:07] <Eviltwin> deadiam: Use current line texts getter
[07:55:09] <stodge> Starting to think I should wait til jqm is stable
[07:55:09] <aaronmcadam> stodge there are a fuckload of changes, u should have been keeping up to date
[07:55:17] <stodge> I don't have time to do that unfortunately
[07:55:19] <aaronmcadam> no upgrade now
[07:55:40] <aaronmcadam> and create issues
[07:55:45] <aaronmcadam> they're being fixed quite fast
[07:56:04] <aaronmcadam> you don't want to wait any longer
[07:56:10] <Rushing> when i use _trigger for a custom ui widget, the callback and the events get different parameters. anyone know why it's designed this way?
[07:56:25] <aaronmcadam> I went off my project for 2 weeks only and there were loads of good fixes
[07:56:39] <Rushing> the callback gets (evt, [args]), and the event handler gets (evt, arg1, arg2, arg3)
[07:57:08] <aaronmcadam> u using widget factory?
[07:57:11] <Rushing> yes
[07:57:17] <aaronmcadam> following ajpiano's site?
[07:57:25] <Rushing> no
[07:57:33] <stodge> I understand but my site is completely broken now. Back button is missing, refreshing a page (nested lists) leaves me with a page with no css and the javascript on each page isn't firing anymore. More reading....
[07:57:46] <ajpiano> i'm not entirely sure *why* it works that way
[07:57:46] <aaronmcadam> Rushing: why the hell not ;) http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[07:57:58] <Accelerator> Is it possible to have jquery "smooth scroll" to the top of a page upon clicking an actual link? Basically, the page scrolls to the top as another page loads (for search results)
[07:58:03] <Accelerator> http://pastie.org/2695067 <- This is what I have now, but it doesn't work as intended.
[07:58:17] <aaronmcadam> stodge, you're way behind, the automatic back button was removed ages ago
[07:58:26] <stodge> :(
[07:58:32] <Rushing> ?scrollTo @Accelerator,
[07:58:42] <aaronmcadam> it's not insurmountable tho stodge
[07:59:00] <aaronmcadam> there's a create event that will reinitialise ur widgets
[07:59:10] <aaronmcadam> $( container ).trigger( 'create' )
[07:59:25] <aaronmcadam> if u go on #jquerymobile I'm in there every day, if ur stuck
[07:59:47] <Accelerator> Rushing: ..?
[07:59:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[08:00:07] <aaronmcadam> ?bot
[08:00:17] <aaronmcadam> ?g test
[08:00:19] <Accelerator> ?ping
[08:00:24] <Accelerator> It's broken, apparently.
[08:00:34] <aaronmcadam> Accelerator: it's simple what u want
[08:00:38] <stodge> No it's not - just my todo list is growing exponentially and I just lost a resource! *sigh*
[08:00:42] <Rushing> aaronmcadam, i already get all that :P
[08:00:55] <aaronmcadam> thought u would Rushing
[08:01:02] <Accelerator> aaronmcadam: Go on..
[08:01:03] <aaronmcadam> just thought somethin might have helped
[08:01:46] <Rushing> one thing i also don't get about the widget factory is that it uses event prefixes instead of namespaces
[08:02:03] <aaronmcadam> i've seen that done before
[08:02:05] <aaronmcadam> you mean
[08:02:16] <deadiam> ist tha a plugin Eviltwin ?
[08:02:16] <aaronmcadam> "widget.click", etc?
[08:02:47] <ajpiano> Rushing: because theoretically someone could then have different namespaced handlers for the various events the widget has
[08:03:01] <aaronmcadam> that's true
[08:03:13] <ajpiano> "dragstop" is the type of the event, it's not a "stop" event in the "drag" namespace
[08:03:19] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: do they use that "widget.click" idea?
[08:03:51] <aaronmcadam> I came across an article saying it's a good idea to namespace events that way
[08:04:05] <Rushing> ajpiano, ah, that makes more sense.
[08:04:22] <ajpiano> within the widgets yes, we bind and set data using namespaces
[08:04:30] <Rushing> ooo, 1.9 is gonna have _super(). that's exciting
[08:04:36] <aaronmcadam> yeah super looks cool
[08:04:44] <pashmi56> hello, how can i check if  $.getJSON is done working, then i can run plugin?
[08:04:53] <aaronmcadam> and referencing super within the widget too Rushing, nice eh
[08:05:25] <Rushing> ajpiano, did you see my question about _trigger?
[08:05:50] <ajpiano> yes, i said i wasn't sure
[08:06:00] <Rushing> oh, missed that
[08:06:27] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano is not omnipotent? noooo :(
[08:06:55] <Rushing> it'd also be nice if _trigger returned the actual event, so you could use event.result etc to let the event do more
[08:07:02] <aaronmcadam> or maybe just in emergencies :D
[08:07:35] <Rushing> _trigger could use one() to just bind the option callback as the first handler
[08:07:39] <aaronmcadam> Rushing are you allying to custom events?
[08:08:40] <ajpiano> Rushing: _trigger returns the value of the callback that you are triggering, iirc
[08:09:15] <Rushing> it just returns whether the callback returned false or the event
[08:09:35] <m4xx> i'm using datepicker in a dialog, on my jsfiddel testing it works just fine, when i use it in my app i'm getting an error saying inst isn't defined when i try to select the date. this is the line: inst.selectedDay = inst.currentDay = $('a', td).html(); in the _selectDay method.
[08:09:42] <ajpiano> i'm not sure what you mean by "return the event"
[08:10:12] <m4xx> the page is a little to complex to post an example\
[08:10:22] <m4xx> any ideas how i can track down the error?
[08:11:22] <chrisj_> I'm having trouble getting bgiframe to work with a jqueryui modal dialog... is there anyone here who might be able to help?
[08:11:36] <Rushing> sumofagun, stupid vpn
[08:11:53] <Rushing> ajpiano, _trigger is basically ... return !callback()===false && !event.result===false && !event.preventDefault()
[08:12:20] <jwa> Hey I'm not sure exactly, but didn't jQuery support the [attr$=value] and [attr^=value] selectors?
[08:13:02] <Rushing> doesn't return any actual information, and if you pass it an event, i.e. var evt = $.Event("yada"); this._trigger("yo", evt, [args]), it copies the evt before it dispatches, so no info is stored in it
[08:13:09] <erichynds> jwa: yeah, it still does
[08:14:01] <jwa> erichynds: it's throwing an exception for me
[08:14:10] <jwa> Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [src$=script.js]
[08:14:20] <ajpiano> jwa: wrap the value in quotes
[08:14:28] <jwa> ow
[08:14:39] <Rushing> ajpiano, any thoughts? you think these things should be improved? seems kinda like the difference between the callback and event handler args is a bug
[08:14:41] <ajpiano> Rushing: hmm, you'd have to check in with scott or joern as to whether that is possible or realistic to be implemented
[08:14:58] <Rushing> ah, don't know either of thems
[08:15:16] <jwa> ajpiano: D'oh that did it, sorry
[08:15:41] <kborchers> i wonder why so many people forget those quotes
[08:16:30] <antihero> Hmm, finding the offset() of a td is not working?
[08:16:34] <michael_mp> hi all
[08:17:04] <Rushing> what documentation generator do you all recommend?
[08:17:15] <NodeX> my butt
[08:17:19] <Rushing> pass
[08:17:23] <versatiletech> lol
[08:17:23] <ajpiano> Rushing: try bringing it up in #jqueryui-dev
[08:17:23] <NodeX> it talks shit all day long :P
[08:24:05] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/YaSt7/ The comments and console log should make the issue clear.  I'm trying to have children of a class that inherit the parent but NOT each other.  They are inheriting siblings, however.  Help would be super appreciated, it's frustrating me.
[08:24:20] <Kambfhase> ?love
[08:24:21] <bot-t> ♥ U
[08:24:29] <Kambfhase> :)
[08:25:04] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/YaSt7/1/ tiny update to the second to last line for clarity.
[08:25:23] <quicksilver> innociv: you might find a kind person to help you but this is not a jquery question. ##javascript or stackoverflow might do better.
[08:25:28] <innociv> true
[08:25:32] <quicksilver> (PS they are not classes)
[08:26:20] <Kambfhase> of that are classes.
[08:26:30] <innociv> ?
[08:26:43] <Hooloovoo> anyone know what's faster? going down a few (like 5) levels with children() or using find()?
[08:26:52] <Kambfhase> why dont you pick one of the drölfthousand class libs out there?
[08:28:21] <Kambfhase> innociv: http://jsfiddle.net/YaSt7/2/
[08:29:05] <chrisj_> does anyone here successfully use bgiframe with jQueryUI dialogs??
[08:29:38] <tjholowaychuk> can jquery templates work with nodes? <li>${paragraphOrSomething}</li>
[08:30:31] <chrisj_> anybody??
[08:31:59] <innociv> Kambfhase, Bar is missing onBoth
[08:32:21] <innociv> kambfhase, because those class libraries do too much?
[08:32:31] <tjholowaychuk> no?
[08:32:33] <tjholowaychuk> haha
[08:32:33] <Kambfhase> mkay
[08:33:15] <bcessa> hi, I've doubt, I have and element like this: <span id="test" data-param="someFunctionOnDoc()" /> how can I set that function to an event handler of another element with jquery? I hope this is clear
[08:33:17] <southplatte> if I have a DOM element, say <div></div> and I run ajax call to add data, and update it every 30 seconds, is running .empty() and adding data faster or slower than running .replaceWith(updatedDataHere) ?
[08:33:23] <innociv> But maybe I'll look at them. I don't really get why it'd be hard to copy a set of prototypes from one object, though.
[08:34:08] <bcessa> something like: $('#otherElement').click( $('#test').attr( 'data-param' ) ) but this is not working
[08:34:11] <Kambfhase> innociv: in my fiddel bar has onBoth.
[08:35:12] <Germanaz0> join /phpar
[08:35:28] <Germanaz0> sorry
[08:35:43] <melkornemesis> bcessa: maybe try $('#otherElement').click( eval($('#test').attr( 'data-param' )) );
[08:36:05] <Kambfhase> <Crock>: never evr use eval
[08:36:15] <kborchers> never never never ever
[08:36:28] <Kambfhase> plus, that doesnt work.
[08:36:54] <melkornemesis> ok :)
[08:37:48] <chrisj_> Still having a problem with jQuery UI dialogs in IE... dropdowns are showing through the overlay. Trying to use bgiframe, but it's not working... if anyone can help, I'm all ears.  :o/
[08:38:12] <innociv> It doesn't for me. How can that be?
[08:38:38] <innociv> Oh it seems to show it in firefox but not chrome
[08:38:38] <bcessa> melkornemesis: thanks for the attention, but yes, still not working
[08:39:00] <bcessa> kborchers: any ideas on how to do it without using eval ?
[08:40:02] <kborchers> bcessa: i'm not sure what you are doing. why do you have   data-param="someFunctionOnDoc()"?
[08:40:04] <melkornemesis> i am curious abt it too
[08:40:29] <chrisj_> bcessa: why are you storing an entire function inside of an attribute like this??
[08:40:42] <bcessa> is set that way as a config option
[08:40:47] <chrisj_> kborchers... great minds... :)
[08:40:58] <kborchers> "config option"?
[08:41:30] <Kambfhase> innociv: pick one: https://gist.github.com/1175651 :D
[08:41:47] <bcessa> yes, I've a plugin that scan a group of element and do something, each element can override config options by using those data attributes
[08:41:50] <innociv> Hm it does work on chrome. It just doesn't show it in inspector.
[08:41:56] <innociv> But bars[1].onBoth() works.
[08:42:08] <chrisj_> to my mind, you wouldn't store any methods in attributes like this... you would instead store small pieces of information that then may be used by methods that are already included in the scripts on the page.
[08:42:28] <Kambfhase> maybe chrome doesn't show it, because it is like one level deeper in the inheritance chain.
[08:42:37] <innociv> What one is best?  Like simplest, i don't need much..
[08:42:38] <innociv> Yeah
[08:42:55] <kborchers> i would do what chrisj_ said
[08:43:06] <bcessa> well yes, only that in this particular case the data required is a function, and the data attribute can handle it, I just don't know how to use it with jquery
[08:43:28] <Kambfhase> yeah, "The best one" well, uuuh, ... wirte your own :)
[08:43:33] <innociv> :p
[08:43:40] <chrisj_> just because the data attribute can hold a method doesn't mean that it should...
[08:44:04] <chrisj_> you have this working somewhere else already??
[08:44:12] <gnarf> chrisj_: i use data to hold methods all the time
[08:44:47] <gnarf> but you can't store it in a "dom attr" or anything
[08:45:13] <innociv> What you fixed up works well. Seems like all I need.
[08:45:25] <innociv> Thank you very much!
[08:45:36] <chrisj_> why would you do that @gnarf? I (personally) like to have my methods included as part of script files, that I can then compress so that my transmission to the browser is minimized... then the data in these attributes is also as small as it possibly can be.
[08:46:00] <Kambfhase> innociv: np, but make sure you include a SHim for old browsers, if you need
[08:46:07] <innociv> SHim?
[08:46:27] <Kambfhase> shim
[08:46:31] <innociv> I try to support back to IE6, fo r the most part.
[08:46:32] <gnarf> chrisj_: you add methods to the .data() in the code - so that method is always available from that element
[08:47:22] <bcessa> chrisj_: what if you want to customize a plugin action in per-element basis, you would need to provide the function on the element itself somehow :o
[08:48:38] <chrisj_> @gnarf... I think I see... also, bcessa, I just re-read your original code... I may have a solution...
[08:49:02] <Kambfhase> innociv: include this line to support old browsers: peof Object.create!="function"){Object.create=function(a){function b(){}b.prototype=a;return new b}}
[08:49:11] <chrisj_> so you have <span id="something" data-param="someFunction()" /> yes?
[08:49:20] <DualDetroit> What technologies are out there for linking together information in completely different systems/databases? Say, I want to link an album of Madonna pictures with a record in my CRM.

[08:49:51] <Kambfhase> ^^
[08:49:52] <innociv> typeof?
[08:49:53] <innociv> yeah
[08:49:55] <PlzHelp> If anyone is interested in trying to answer this question - still looking for a jquery validate solution.
[08:49:59] <bcessa> chrisj_: yes

[08:50:01] <PlzHelp> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7758931
[08:50:03] <innociv> Thanks!
[08:50:03] <chrisj_> okay...
[08:50:51] <chrisj_> hang tight... I'm gonna psudo code something on jsfiddle real quick... brb.
[08:52:39] <Kambfhase> psudo: make me a sandwich
[08:53:28] <NodeX> heh
[08:54:08] <NodeX> $(".large-vodka").into('#NodeX');
[08:55:20] <melkornemesis> vodka!
[08:55:48] <melkornemesis> reminds me old times
[08:55:49] <DualDetroit> <The web MC> Mah javascript files are large; mah databases are in charge. Cuz I got a bass degree from the 313; it's my PHD! And that's how I am an MC and an ECMAScriptist from Motown! </The web MC>
[08:59:07] <chrisj_> bcessa... what I was thinking still makes use of an eval...
[08:59:16] <chrisj_> thought I could do it without one...
[09:00:14] <bcessa> I don't know how to do it even using eval, the method get's trigger when attaching the handler
[09:00:44] <chrisj_> http://jsfiddle.net/cjordan/JRL4v/3/
[09:00:56] <chrisj_> there's an example using eval... which is still kinda a shame...
[09:01:34] <NodeX> use apply() or call()
[09:01:47] <chrisj_> Originally I thought you were putting the function DEFINITION in the data-param attribute... it was only later I realized that you were putting essentially the name of the function there...
[09:02:03] <chrisj_> hmm... lemme try that in my test real quick NodeX
[09:02:15] <NodeX> var callback=function(){ $(this).attr... mikght also work
[09:02:24] <NodeX> (never tried it but it might!
[09:03:56] <bcessa> great, is working now using eval, gonna try using apply or call :) thnx a ton
[09:04:19] <chrisj_> I just tried my example using call and apply and neither work...
[09:05:06] <chrisj_> NodeX check out the jsFiddle link I supplied to see my solution using eval... however call and apply don't work in this situation. Would love to see an example like this that works without using eval() :(
[09:05:30] <NodeX> Just working on one for you
[09:05:44] <NodeX> I've done it before but ages ago
[09:06:02] <chrisj_> I don't really need it... bcessa does... I'm still looking for someone that can assist with a dumb jQueryUI issue I'm having...
[09:06:21] <jedimind> when was $.data() changed to read data- attribute ? in what version of jquery ? anyone know off han
[09:06:22] <jedimind> d
[09:06:50] <NodeX> ?data
[09:06:50] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[09:06:53] <NodeX> it's in the docs
[09:07:56] <jedimind> AWWWWWWWW SO CLOSE
[09:08:06] <jedimind> the site im updating is using 1.4.2  and this was introduced in 1.4.3
[09:08:07] <jedimind> goddamnit
[09:08:13] <kborchers> chrisj_: so your dialog issue ... see ?demo
[09:08:14] <bot-t> chrisj_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:09:52] <chrisj_> kborchers... I've tried creating a live demo of the issue on jsfiddle, but it doesn't apply an overlay for some reason...
[09:10:15] <kborchers> did you include the UI css?
[09:10:42] <chrisj_> the issue I'm having is an OLD one... where the select boxes are showing through the overlay. I've got bgiframe included, and I'm invoking it through the dialog options, but it doesn't seem to have an effect.
[09:11:26] <chrisj_> I assumed that jsfiddle took care of that for me when I told it I wanted to include the jQuery UI library...
[09:11:27] <chrisj_> does it not?
[09:11:46] <khmer> i don't think so
[09:11:54] <kborchers> no
[09:12:01] <stodge> Hmm progress. Mostly working the latest rc1 of jqm, except my nested list is broken. Page one is displayed, click the first list item, second page slides in. First page is then re-displayed on top of page 2
[09:12:13] <orentanay> is there a jQuery feature that lets me test for quirks mode?
[09:12:45] <chrisj_> then how do i include the jquery ui css on jsfiddle?
[09:13:06] <chrisj_> it seems odd to me that it would automatically (with the check of a box) include the library, without including the css too...
[09:13:13] <stodge> Or someitmes it slides page 2 in and then quickly shows a white page
[09:14:14] <Zerks> darn. I'm using css3 transform: rotate (90 degree increments). when flipped on its side, jquery .position() in chrome correctly identifies the new .left/.top, while firefox treats it as if it were never rotated
[09:14:15] <khmer> orentanay: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode#Mode_verification
[09:14:20] <Zerks> any advice?
[09:15:15] <DualDetroit> Why can't I write an entire web app in a jquery plugin?
[09:15:49] <khmer> DualDetroit: why can't i write an MVC framework in COBOL?
[09:16:12] <bcessa> DualDetroit: can't as in shouldn't or as in physically impossible?
[09:16:27] <DualDetroit> Why shouldn't I, I mean.
[09:16:55] <Elephant> What would be the motivation to do that?
[09:17:27] <khmer> i do like the idea of $(document).serveUpWordpressSite("3.2.1")
[09:17:32] <khmer> now that's real development
[09:17:39] <khmer> look, it happened in one line, therefore it's faster and better
[09:17:52] <DualDetroit> khmer: What's wrong with that!
[09:17:55] <bcessa> suppose that's more likely based on style and design than anything else right? may be is no the best approach for something complex
[09:18:28] <quicksilver> $(document).step1().???.step3("PROFIT!")
[09:18:30] <khmer> DualDetroit: the main reason not to do that is that it encapsulates more state in your plugin than an average browser and user agent can efficiently manage.
[09:18:59] <khmer> DualDetroit: if you were to use the UI widget factory to make a stateful plugin, for instance, then you're sending methodcalls via string
[09:19:08] <DualDetroit> Ah, state should be managed by a database on the server
[09:19:10] <khmer> $body.webApp('doSomething')
[09:19:26] <impatient> hello friends
[09:19:27] <DualDetroit> khmer: eww :<
[09:19:33] <DualDetroit> Okay, not good
[09:20:24] <bcessa> DualDetroit: for a complex or medium size application to put all the code in a single class/file/plugin should be too hard to maintain, is better for split the functionality in a more meaningful and manageable way, design patters and that kind of stuff
[09:20:31] <khmer> exactly
[09:20:59] <impatient> we're looking for a -good- and preferably lightweight and easy to use jquery plugin (lib) to allow highly customizable form elements
[09:21:01] <khmer> DualDetroit: it adds nothing to do that; you can't really $('#somediv').makeIntoRichInternetApplication() without having a whole lot of environment set
[09:21:02] <impatient> particularly dropdowns
[09:21:16] <impatient> anyone got any suggestions?
[09:21:22] <bcessa> is not that's not possible, simply not the best approach
[09:21:43] <impatient> I've "inherited" a solution using jqtransform
[09:21:56] <DualDetroit> So what's a more appropriate container than a jquery plugin for a webapp? Django/Ruby on Rails/some other MVC framework?
[09:21:58] <impatient> and I want to throw it in the deepest part of the garbage and never look back
[09:23:19] <jita> This was the original division http://i.imgur.com/DAoya.png, after applying jquery cycle plugin the image gets out of its bottom border like http://i.imgur.com/qBI3Q.png. Any ideas why ?
[09:23:47] <bcessa> DualDetroit: well a webapp is a lot of pieces working together, backend, model, views, etc, you should take all that in consideration
[09:24:42] <DualDetroit> bcessa: So, there is no container, other than the entire server.
[09:25:27] <impatient> any takers?
[09:25:58] <aaronmcadam> hhe ajpiano smoosh makes my terminal pretty :D
[09:26:17] <bcessa> DualDetroit: not exactly, I mean, javascript is a (mostly) clientside language, you should use it to enhance you user interface and all that, depending on the application you're trying to build you may need some serverside functionality like a database, backend, etc
[09:26:40] <aaronmcadam> node n-n-n-noooode :D
[09:26:49] <DualDetroit> Twisted Python!
[09:26:55] <aaronmcadam> ++
[09:27:04] <Tobsn> friend of mine just finished twisted
[09:27:05] <bcessa> I for example use PHP on the server with Codeigniter, MongoDB as database and jquery to enhance my web based views :o
[09:27:08] <aaronmcadam> DualDetroit: do u ever use celery?
[09:27:09] <Tobsn> he read everything he could find
[09:27:22] <Tobsn> now he says he knows exactly how it works
[09:27:28] <Tobsn> i showed him nodejs... now he's using node.js
[09:27:29] <Tobsn> ...
[09:27:40] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[09:27:54] <aaronmcadam> it's just grokking the paradigm really i think
[09:27:57] <Tobsn> and that guy is a huge python fan
[09:27:58] <DualDetroit> aaronmcadam: Why?
[09:27:59] <aaronmcadam> not that I have yet! :D
[09:28:11] <DualDetroit> aaronmcadam: Is Celery good?
[09:28:15] <aaronmcadam> DualDetroit: we use celery a lot at my place just
[09:28:22] <aaronmcadam> yeah!! it's awesome, no more crons!
[09:28:24] <DualDetroit> Tobsn: Twisted > Node.js
[09:28:32] <aaronmcadam> well, we're still switching over some crons
[09:28:38] <Tobsn> thats what i would say
[09:28:44] <Tobsn> just from the obvious facts
[09:28:49] <aaronmcadam> think it just depends
[09:28:53] <Tobsn> but it seems like nodejs just gets the job done quicker
[09:29:00] <aaronmcadam> twisted is obviously much more mature
[09:29:06] <Tobsn> node.js kinda became the php of the next gen
[09:29:14] <Tobsn> or will become
[09:29:16] <aaronmcadam> I'm only using node for it's command line packages, it's awesome
[09:29:27] <Tobsn> i love it because of socket.io ;)
[09:29:36] <Tobsn> now.js etc.
[09:29:36] <bcessa> thanks a lot
[09:29:54] <Tobsn> its just so incredible easy
[09:30:09] <Tobsn> http://nowjs.com/ just look at the code... that's basically all you need
[09:30:26] <Tobsn> thats amazing.
[09:30:28] <aaronmcadam> do u use vows?
[09:30:31] <Tobsn> sometimes
[09:30:35] <chrisj_> I can't get my jQuery UI example to break in jsfiddle... In fact, even in IE WITHOUT explicitly including bgiframe, my select box is still hidden by the overlay...
[09:30:36] <aaronmcadam> looks class
[09:30:42] <Tobsn> yeah vows is nice
[09:30:43] <aaronmcadam> I still wanna learn jasmine
[09:30:46] <jita> This was the original division http://i.imgur.com/DAoya.png, after applying jquery cycle plugin the image gets out of its bottom border like http://i.imgur.com/qBI3Q.png. Any ideas why ?
[09:30:57] <aaronmcadam> also, u seen ender? it's interesting too
[09:31:13] <Tobsn> yeah ender is interesting too but all that stuff is for rather big projects
[09:31:18] <Tobsn> i tend to just use steps
[09:31:19] <aaronmcadam> yep
[09:33:29] <DualDetroit> jita: I hope the designer is coming.
[09:34:00] <jita> DualDetroit: lol unfortunately the designer is on vacation
[09:34:13] <DualDetroit> Well you need him
[09:35:05] <DualDetroit> jita: If the client see that make sure their office isn't very high up because they're gonna wanna jump out a window.
[09:35:43] <jita> DualDetroit: dont worry, i wont be showing that any sooner
[09:35:55] <DualDetroit> :p
[09:48:31] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[09:50:12] <ProLoser|Work> anyone around?
[09:50:20] <gnarf> nope, i'm a square
[09:50:40] * gnarf runs off 
[09:51:08] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/TVLcP/
[09:51:22] <ProLoser|Work> for some reason the jv.Resources.includes() isn't working
[09:51:35] <ProLoser|Work> or more specifically, it's not deferring properly
[09:52:25] <Piratelv> Is it possible to assign data to a global variable. ( window.data) from within a ajax callback?
[09:52:35] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[09:52:58] <ProLoser|Work> however if you don't have to
[09:53:18] <ProLoser|Work> *you don't have to
[09:53:38] <Piratelv> yeayea, know that. I just need to store it some where since I need to run 2 calls. And need them both at the same time.
[09:54:01] <ProLoser|Work> $.when()
[09:55:48] <Piratelv> oowww, Didn't know that one. Still thinking in 1.3 terms :) Thank you.
[09:56:02] <chrisj_> folks I'm still unable to get the bgiframe plugin to effectly block textboxes and selects when opening a jQueryUI dialog (v1.8.14)... I've tried putting an example up on jsFiddle, but it blocks the selects and such without any problem (and incedentally without me having to include bgiframe, or indeed without me having to mention bgiframe at all)
[09:58:19] <kborchers> chrisj_: can you provide a link to your site?
[09:58:29] <innociv> Kambfhase, have an issue with that code.  http://jsfiddle.net/YaSt7/10/ I also need to overwrite functions with updated versions(adding code to the end.)  In this case, the original code is all deleted and just the extend code added.  I forgot to mention that before.  Though, maybe I should have a separate function doing that if I ahve to.
[09:58:35] <kborchers> oh well
[09:59:29] <innociv> DualDetroit, I don't know, why?
[09:59:59] <DualDetroit> innociv: Yo yo yo, I'm the boy from motown-- so I got a database degree from the 313 -- it's my PHD. Which means I think I want to use Foreign Data Wrappers in MongoDB.
[10:00:35] <DualDetroit> Yous probably herd 'bout my epic MCs in da #postgresql.
[10:00:57] <nisseni> I have this: http://pastie.org/private/rjbfjub791wtel3h8oeja - I can see in firebug that the result is correct, however, the second dropdown isn't populated...
[10:01:30] <innociv> Meh yeah. I should be using separate functions for that. Done.
[10:03:30] <Kambfhase> :)
[10:05:22] <nisseni> any ideas?
[10:09:03] <Kambfhase> nisseni: do you really want us to know your DB user and PW?
[10:09:15] <nisseni> gee
[10:09:18] <nisseni> bad bad me
[10:10:09] <Pilate> dont worry we can truncate yer tables for you
[10:10:52] <Kambfhase> yeah, will send you little, bobby tables, He'll do that for you!
[10:12:09] <Kambfhase> code looks ok to me.
[10:12:13] <nisseni> well, I do hope, although I changed the pwd, that people here are honest and wouldn't do such a thing
[10:12:23] <nisseni> anyhow, you have a solution for my problem?
[10:12:34] <kitikonti> could someone pleas write me a message, i want to test this client
[10:12:54] <Kambfhase> oh, now i see your problem.
[10:14:15] <lz> -_ - my cofounder got his iphone 4s http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WAFOKjOqfQ
[10:14:28] <nisseni> Kambfhase: the problem, except revealing the pwd?
[10:14:35] <hdtdi> kitikonti, message
[10:14:57] <Kambfhase> http://pastie.org/2695956
[10:15:24] <kitikonti> hdtdi, thx
[10:16:25] <Eviltwin> select.append($("<option>").text(array['variety']))
[10:18:05] <nisseni> Eviltwin: didn't do the trick
[10:18:14] <nisseni> Kambfhase: didn't do the trick either :)
[10:18:37] <Kambfhase> mmmm
[10:18:38] <Eviltwin> Oh, I thought this was Kambfhase's code
[10:18:43] <Kambfhase> please paste your JSON
[10:20:33] <soc42> well, can you please have a look at this? it's a post form to a new js popup, but the POST params are not beeing received? see: http://jsfiddle.net/VALzC/
[10:20:58] <DualDetroit> Couches *CRUSH* mongobirds, and redis sounds like a radioactive fusion reactor that vaporizes couches.
[10:21:36] <coltra|partyhat> I have http://paste2.org/p/1717808 this index file and http://paste2.org/p/1717810 marquee.php | the file runs through the first time fine, but when it refreshes it starts doubling the content ontop of itself and each refresh it gets worse and worse.
[10:21:52] <Eviltwin> Oh God
[10:21:54] <Kambfhase> nisseni: why do you use .getJSON() but in your select_lan.php you echo TML?
[10:21:58] <Eviltwin> Never, *EVER* use with
[10:22:35] <soc42> Eviltwin: what's the matter with "with"?
[10:22:36] <Kambfhase> Crock says: "Don't use `with( obj){}`" I say: use `for( x in obj)eval(x+"=obj[x]")`
[10:22:39] <Eviltwin> soc42: Everything
[10:22:43] <nisseni> Kambfhase: I really suck at jquery, I just used a script I found
[10:22:56] <soc42> Eviltwin: that's a lot ;o)
[10:23:49] <kitikonti> hdtdi, could you please write one more message
[10:23:56] <hdtdi> kitikonti, message
[10:24:10] <soc42> can you please help, i'm stuck in between form submit, post and a new window...
[10:24:12] <kitikonti> thx
[10:25:20] <soc42> the page has to post a foo param to the print page
[10:25:30] <soc42> the page shows up, but the param does not...
[10:25:36] <Kambfhase> nisseni: try this: http://pastie.org/2696014
[10:26:42] <soc42> so the open page works, but the form submit does probably not...
[10:27:12] <objNoob> Hi, trying to disable sorting on all columns after $('#table').tablersorter();
[10:27:39] <snover> soc42: 'with' is extremely slow, causes browser engine optimizations to not work, and is actually forbidden in ES5 strict mode (a mode which you will never use, but it is considered bad enough that it has been blocked there)
[10:27:55] <itatitat> ey guys!
[10:28:29] <innociv> I love the hearts in the topic.
[10:28:36] <itatitat> I've a question, when I write <script src=...........></script>
[10:28:42] <itatitat> src is with / or \
[10:28:53] <objNoob> . /
[10:28:56] <itatitat> ok
[10:28:57] <glauco29> hi
[10:29:00] <glauco29>  I am firing a colorbox inside a iframe via a link, But I would need to reference the iframe to remove a div inside it
[10:29:01] <itatitat> thanks
[10:29:14] <glauco29> I have tried window.frames["cbox1318611703312"].find('.default-sidebar').remove(); but It dont find iframe reference
[10:29:18] <objNoob> itatitat starting with a / however will being at the webroot
[10:29:33] <objNoob> begin*
[10:30:12] <coltra|partyhat> I am assuming that I just need to but some from of "end" in my jquery?
[10:30:34] <objNoob> Hi, trying to disable sorting on all columns after $('#table').tablersorter(); Any Idears, Any body?
[10:31:10] <phlp> glauco29: http://api.jquery.com/contents
[10:31:30] <itatitat> ey!, I've a problem
[10:31:35] <soc42> snover: so you think "with" is the problem here?
[10:31:40] <snover> you asked
[10:31:41] <snover> I answered
[10:31:41] <itatitat> the console's outuput is:
[10:31:44] <snover> I did not look at your code :)
[10:31:46] <itatitat> $ is not defined
[10:31:56] <itatitat> but I dont know how to solve it...
[10:32:12] <Eviltwin> itatitat: Is this with WordPress or something?
[10:32:20] <itatitat> django
[10:32:26] <itatitat> Im working with python
[10:32:43] <objNoob> itatitat your path to the jquery library is incorrect in <script> tag
[10:33:03] <itatitat> yes....I though the same, ok, thanks!
[10:33:09] <nisseni> Kambfhase: now I don't get the ID in get...
[10:33:28] <soc42> http://jsfiddle.net/VALzC/1/
[10:33:29] <Kambfhase> you dont?
[10:33:37] <objNoob> itatitat like I said.. in src='' if you start with a / your starting directory is the web root
[10:33:51] <objNoob> so maybe it should be
[10:34:14] <objNoob> src='javascript/jquery.js'  something like that
[10:34:40] <objNoob> this way it starts looking in the current directory of file.
[10:34:45] <nisseni> Kambfhase: ah, it used $_POST now, so I changed that and now it works... :)
[10:34:49] <nisseni> thanks a lot
[10:34:53] <Kambfhase> :)
[10:37:30] <DecoyOctopus> hey guys. I need some help. Im a total noob, and I'm creating a pretty little UI for a friend of mine. What is the best way to position elements?
[10:37:46] <context> decoyoctopus: on the screen.
[10:37:47] <JuJuBee> Im trying to submit a form following a jConfirm... http://pastebin.com/K6UVWzjU  but it is not working...
[10:38:07] <coltra|partyhat> DecoyOctopus: #CSS
[10:38:27] <DecoyOctopus> I want the center ot be a big graph, and to the right of that graph i want some controls to change that graph
[10:38:40] <DecoyOctopus> if I use .appendChild, or .append, can I still inject css like that?
[10:38:56] <DecoyOctopus> will it appear in the correct place if I append it to an existing element? is this the proper way to do it?
[10:39:46] <context> decoyoctopus: try it ?
[10:40:13] <DecoyOctopus> good point.What I'm struggling with right now is syntax as well. Like, I want to create a form elemen tright?
[10:40:16] <context> honestly... if you even just TRY it... and it doesnt work... pretty sure WW3 isnt gonna be started cause of it.
[10:40:27] <context> decoyoctopus: wrong.
[10:40:55] <DecoyOctopus> context: esxplain?
[10:41:15] <context> you asked us what you wanted. so im gonna give you a stupid answer.
[10:41:26] <context> i dont know wth you want.
[10:41:45] <DecoyOctopus> I try this. createElement("input")
[10:41:49] <Kambfhase> may be he doesnt know either
[10:41:51] <DecoyOctopus> and this crashes the hell out of my page.
[10:41:52] <ProLoser|Work> hallo

[10:43:27] <coltra|partyhat> I have http://paste2.org/p/1717808 this index file and http://paste2.org/p/1717810 marquee.php | the file runs through the first time fine, but when it refreshes it starts doubling the content ontop of itself and each refresh it gets worse and worse.
[10:43:29] <Kambfhase> 'doesnt work'
[10:43:39] <glauco29> But jquery dont get the iframe reference
[10:44:07] <DecoyOctopus> I can get my graph in teh iframe to show up, and i try to get the position of that with $("#cheese').position().right;
[10:44:15] <glauco29> Would be better use id to get iframe reference?
[10:44:28] <JuJuBee> Anyone?  line 7 of http://pastebin.com/K6UVWzjU doesn't seem to do what I want which is a standard post of the form.
[10:44:31] <DecoyOctopus> and then I inject css
[10:44:36] <phlp> glauco29: are the pages on the same domain?
[10:46:17] <context> jujubee: whats ans ?
[10:46:26] <context> is said function ever even called
[10:46:29] <context> do you know this?
[10:46:46] <context> wth is the point of the return false; at the very end of that
[10:47:04] <JuJuBee> context: ans is the response from jConfirm (true/false)
[10:47:17] <context> how do you know ?
[10:47:32] <context> what is ans when the if() is called?
[10:47:37] <context> have you tried to find out ?
[10:47:52] <JuJuBee> context: if I replace line 7 with an alert it does pop up when I press OK adn not when I press cancel.
[10:47:57] <context> is $('#testForm') in fact finding your form ?
[10:48:21] <context> ok so the function gets called. thats your next issue
[10:48:38] <JuJuBee> context: good question, how do I test for that?
[10:48:41] <context> why not find out what $('#testForm') is ? you cant submit a form that doesn't exist
[10:48:52] <context> console.log ? console.dir ? alert ?
[10:49:08] <context> simple way is .length
[10:49:22] <context> we call this 'trouble shooting'
[10:52:38] <DualDetroit> What does query mean in jquery?
[10:53:37] <JuJuBee> context: what does a length of 1 for the form mean?
[10:54:39] <context> it obviously found something ?
[10:54:56] <JuJuBee> yes, it did
[10:54:57] <context> the docs explain what jQuery.length returns
[10:55:07] <phlp> http://api.jquery.com/size
[10:56:12] <JuJuBee> context: ok, so the form exists.  Why doesn't it post?
[10:56:49] <context> you got me
[11:00:22] <DecoyOctopus> JQUERY DOCUMENTATION IS WORSE THAN HORSE DICK.
[11:01:39] <Sajaki> that' one way to put it :)
[11:01:53] <windsurf_> is there an html5 framework (like jquery/extjs) out there that will let you target desktop AND mobile devices? i know with ExtJS for example that you can't scroll with a swipe gesture.
[11:01:59] <phlp> it's better than no horse dick at all
[11:02:02] <JuJuBee> And you know what horse dick is like from experience?  I wouldn't admit that....
[11:02:08] <kborchers> wow, i'd hate to know what happened to him involving a horse dick to prompt that kind of reaction
[11:02:40] <Prot> Question: if you do a [form].submit(formcallback) on a form, is there any way to determine which submit button was pressed on the form submit event?
[11:02:48] <Prot> trying to emulate what would happen without javascript
[11:03:03] <inad922> Is there a javascript library out there with a semaphore or something similar or events are getting queued or how they are handled?

[11:05:14] <Brodingo> not sure if that helps
[11:05:40] <ProLoser|Work> does $().load() return a deferred?

[11:07:00] <DualDetroit> ;>
[11:07:43] * ProLoser|Work googles aapl
[11:07:56] <Brodingo> really?
[11:07:56] <ProLoser|Work> wait, i think i just said an oxymoron
[11:08:21] <inad922> I would like to update a list based on which part of google map is shown. Basically I update the list triggered by pan/zoom events. The problem is that these events are generated too often and manipulating the dom tree like that is just slow. So I somehow want to implement a FIFO with storing only 1 event. So like an event comes in and I start processing it and if other events come in meanwhile I only want to process the
[11:08:22] <inad922>  last one but I guess that javascript is not really the language for this.
[11:09:13] <DualDetroit> inad922: So don't always update the DOM.
[11:09:18] <ProLoser|Work> how can i convert this to .ajax() so it returns deferred objects? http://jsfiddle.net/7TjBh/
[11:09:40] <Kambfhase> ProLoser|Work: oxymoron? als long as you dont say penis everything is permitted.
[11:10:02] <DualDetroit> inad922: Do a setTimeout() on each event and don't update the DOM again until the setTimeout() expires
[11:10:04] <inad922> DualDetroit: Yeah but with the Fifo solution it would be cool and fast but I just need a semaphore for it.
[11:10:18] <DualDetroit> inad922: First In First Out?
[11:12:11] <inad922> DualDetroit: Yeah. with only 1 storage. So basically it just try to grab the semaphore and if it can it updates the dom if it can't it just rewrites the fifo(well you only need a variable I guess) maybe we need to check event generation time if such exists. How are the events handled by the browsers?
[11:12:22] <inad922> Is there somekind of queue?
[11:12:27] <inad922> which stores them?
[11:13:11] <DualDetroit> inad922: That's what I want to know!
[11:13:19] <phlp> ?js var a = []; a.push(1); a.push(2); a.shift();
[11:13:20] <bot-t> phlp: 1
[11:14:10] <inad922> DualDetroit: :)
[11:17:51] <ProLoser|Work> i need help converting this to .ajax http://jsfiddle.net/7TjBh/1/
[11:20:50] <mbroadst> Does anyone here use the query form plugin? I have a situation where I want to pass back a custom header in the xhr, however the plugin seems to use an iframe for all of its submissions (for file upload I think), and the resulting xhr is null. Any ideas on how to get around this?
[11:24:15] <cruxst> ProLoser|Work: ok
[11:26:03] <cruxst> ProLoser|Work: can you augment the fiddle with markup for testing?
[11:37:51] <inad922> if I register a key event listener for an element with $(...).keyup() how can I remove it?

[11:53:31] <rns> anyone know how to make my ajax spinner display something else where there is an error?
[11:54:15] <erichynds> rns: use an error callback
[11:55:45] <rns> erichynds, will that let me change the spinner image when there is an error?
[11:55:51] <erichynds> yeah bro
[11:56:30] <erichynds> $.get("foo.htm").fail(function(){ /* change spinner */ });
[11:57:58] <rns> erichynds, how would that work with this? http://dpaste.com/634499/
[11:59:03] <erichynds> rns: http://dpaste.com/634500/
[12:02:17] <kamaji> possibly stupid question alert: can I use $.get with external rss feeds?
[12:02:21] <rns> erichynds, thanks I will give that a try...are there any ajax error image spinners that you know about?
[12:02:25] <kamaji> or are there those XSS security things
[12:07:29] <erichynds> rns: never heard of an error spinner
[12:07:41] <erichynds> rns: usually you want to tell the user what the error was
[12:09:34] <rns> erichynds, so that code you gave me will hide the spinner and show the error message?
[12:11:51] <koden> hey all
[12:12:54] <objNoob> whats wrong with this line
[12:12:55] <objNoob> $(elObj).not('.hacked').each(0,function(){$(this).remove();});
[12:12:57] <koden> so I have a form in a modal and it submits through ajax, once it submits and the person closes the modal if they open it again the form must be reset, how can I do this
[12:13:06] <objNoob> $(elObj).not('.hacked').each(function(){$(this).remove();});
[12:14:14] <rroelofs> objNoob: are you trying to reset the values?
[12:14:17] <phlp> needs more cowbell
[12:15:42] <rroelofs> objNoob: sorry, I conflated your and koden question
[12:16:36] <koden> haha cool, rroelofs I am not trying to reset values persay, my boss just wants the form to sumbit but then be able to submit a second time
[12:16:43] <koden> or third, etc
[12:17:25] <rroelofs> koden:  you probably want something like $('formSelector').find(":input").val("")
[12:17:49] <koden> actually this might be a TON easier, I should have shown this before
[12:18:25] <koden> http://pastebin.com/xGtSwX9r
[12:18:35] <rroelofs> objNoob: I would bet your selector isn't finding what you expect.
[12:20:05] <phlp> koden: $(form).reset() in submitHandler
[12:22:11] <rroelofs> koden:  your dialog close handler looks good to me.
[12:23:29] <koden> this would be after submission tho, that is where I'm having difficulty, so they want a submission response. then on close of the dialog, it would need to reset the form, I dont know how to combine those two
[12:24:34] <koden> phlp and rroelofs ^^
[12:25:20] <soc42> well, the knowledge of good ol' html properties helped in the situation of doing a POST to a popup window... <form target="fooNewWindow" is the key ;o)
[12:25:33] <phlp> you want the dialog to close after the submit?
[12:26:24] <koden> the user would close the dialog after the submit, but if they forgot to add something, they would open up the dialog again and then re-submit the form
[12:26:47] <koden> after filling out the form all over again
[12:26:50] <koden> if that makes sense
[12:27:21] <koden> right now the action is, they get the confirmation response, close the dialog, and when they open the dialog again, the confirmation is still there
[12:27:33] <koden> I need it to show an all new form, without refreshing the browser
[12:27:53] <LakWork> is it possible to do an attribute-based selector case-insensitive?
[12:28:14] <phlp> cant you remove the confirmation in the close callback?
[12:28:18] <LakWork> I am trying to map a value corresponding to a field name to a given field and the value may not exactly match casing
[12:29:07] <koden> oh maybe I could
[12:29:25] <koden> also LakWork http://stackoverflow.com/questions/187537/is-there-a-case-insensitive-jquery-contains-selector
[12:29:28] <koden> second answer
[12:29:59] <solidus-river> how do i get the value of value
[12:30:01] <solidus-river> ...
[12:30:14] <phlp> .val()
[12:30:24] <LakWork> that's not gonna work koden
[12:30:32] <LakWork> I need to create a selector
[12:30:36] <solidus-river> <div value="3" class="test"> $('.test').val() returns []
[12:30:52] <BarelyFitz> LakWork: how about .filter(fn)
[12:31:08] <LakWork> give var foo = 'Name' $('form input[name='+foo+']');
[12:31:15] <LakWork> where foo could be name, or Name
[12:31:25] <phlp> divs dont have a value try .attr('value')
[12:31:40] <LakWork> filter might work
[12:31:57] <LakWork> but it would be a little heavy, i'd have to loop over all the values manually
[12:32:55] <BarelyFitz> it's going to be a little heavy no matter what. just limit the number of inputs you are comparing against and it should be okay.
[12:33:14] <pixel13> greetings all!
[12:33:36] <pixel13> does anyone know here if it's possible to just a selector based on a negative pattern?
[12:34:15] <pixel13> such as, $('p.className') but only for those p.className WITHOUT a child <A>
[12:35:03] <BarelyFitz> pixel13: :not(selector) ?
[12:35:17] <pixel13> :not(:contains(a)) ….so like this?
[12:35:43] <BarelyFitz> ?tias
[12:35:43] <bot-t> Try It And See
[12:36:17] <phlp> $('p.className:not(:has(a))')
[12:37:50] <pixel13> :)
[12:38:28] <ColKurtz> so for my lightbox needs i've long settled into colorbox on account of it's extensive options and api. But i haven't looked for any other lightbox scripts in a while and i'm wondering if anybody else has a favorite?
[12:40:45] <trumpetmic> how are people dealing with big json files?  I have a simple table of data, and I wish I could use excel or something while editing the data intially.
[12:41:44] <koden> phlp thanks a lot that suggestion worked wonderfully... I can't believe I couldn't logically think of that myself. Thanks again
[12:42:03] <phlp> no problem :)
[12:44:29] <raygerrard> evening
[12:45:17] <jedimind> HOLY CHRIST I WANT TO PUNCH SOMEONE IN THE FACE
[12:45:33] <jedimind> ive spent the last 6 hours arguing with a client's tech team that a jquery upgrade from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3 is not going to break their entire site
[12:45:38] <jedimind> and they dont beleive me
[12:46:34] <phlp> rename the 1.4.3 file to 1.4.2
[12:46:47] * context punches jedimind in the face
[12:47:14] <jedimind> phlp, i would've done that 5.5 hours ago except they use the google CDN
[12:47:35] <context> jedimind: just be like 'instead of argueing for the past 6 hours, we could have upgraded a test site, and let you look around for SIX FUCKING HOURS to prove its not broken'
[12:47:46] <jedimind> ive said that numerous times already
[12:47:59] <context> tell their managers ?
[12:48:04] <jedimind> they're just so fucking beaurochratic and their main tech lead is an absolute tool so he just doesnt want to look like an idiot
[12:48:12] <jdummy> Is it possible to eliminate "304 Not Modified" requests through caching?
[12:48:40] <ColKurtz> lol jedimind
[12:48:46] <context> jedimind: 'hi big boss guy, your team wasted 6 hours of my life and your money instead of spending 30 minutes to check that something in fact works'
[12:49:08] <pixel13> @BarelyFitz @phlp — thx :not(:has(a)) did the trick!
[12:49:15] <ColKurtz> 1.6.2
[12:49:18] <context> jedimind: the tech lead will probably think twice and 'acually work' next time you ask for something
[12:49:28] <context> jedimind: shitty thing to do, BUT it gets work done.
[12:49:28] <ColKurtz> er
[12:49:33] <ColKurtz> damn it's 1.6.4
[12:50:38] <ColKurtz> jedimind, why such an old version? what about the site is incompatible with the latest version?
[12:50:49] <context> jedimind: if they have acceptance tests its even more stupid you spend that much time argueing
[12:50:57] <rgr> is there any jquery way of making a dialog appear over the top of the poxy flash plugin used for things like youtube embeds?
[12:50:58] <jedimind> NOTHING is incompatible
[12:51:03] <jedimind> i already testted it all locally
[12:51:11] <jedimind> its all standard plugins like ui and validation plugin
[12:51:41] <context> jedimind: upgrade the code so the old jquery breaks the site, but it works with the new version
[12:51:44] <context> :p
[12:52:20] <context> i never understood why people are so anti-keep-everything-up-to-date
[12:52:38] <phlp> just bump it up to 1.4.4 when they aren't looking and if they ask just say "well you said you didn't want 1.4.3"
[12:53:32] <context> im surprised you actually wasted 6 hours. i actually wish i could get paid for debating for 6 hours
[12:53:55] <context> id prolly get bored after 1 and just go 'i win, upgaded, done. debate over'
[12:57:20] <Decoy_> hey friends! I GOTTA QUESTION!
[12:57:25] <pootpoot> WHAT?!
[12:57:31] <Decoy_> someone wanna looki at my code and tell me what I'm don wrong?
[12:57:42] <Brodingo> ABSOLUTELY
[12:57:52] <rgr> can I make an element temporarily invisible but not have it collapse. e.g I have an <embed/> element in side an "li.embed". I wish to make the embed vanish but the li.embed not shrink but stay the same size( I dont know the size). Do I need to manually set the height value into data() and the restore later?
[12:58:03] <Decoy_> amazing. Ok, a quick explination: I'm trying to get the input element to appear to the right of the iframe.
[12:58:11] <Brodingo> visibility: hidden
[12:58:33] <Decoy_> http://pastebin.com/vCm0tqxC
[12:58:34] <Decoy_> here it is
[12:58:36] <Decoy_> check i yo
[12:58:47] <rgr> Brodingo: was that to me? That is different than hide(show?
[12:58:55] <Brodingo> thats css
[12:58:59] <Kambfhase> doc = iframe.contentDocument; // For NS6
[12:59:02] <rgr> was that to me?
[12:59:05] <Brodingo> yes
[12:59:06] <Kambfhase> ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?
[12:59:15] <rgr> and that doesnt shrink the parent?
[12:59:26] <Brodingo> i dont believe so
[12:59:40] <rgr> hmm, thought it did. I'll try it.
[12:59:52] <smplstk> visibility: hidden keeps height/width
[12:59:55] <ColKurtz> rgr,
[12:59:57] <Decoy_> input friends?
[12:59:58] <ColKurtz> visibility:hidden;
[13:00:09] <smplstk> whereass display: none; acts as if the element isn't there at all.
[13:00:19] <ColKurtz> ^
[13:00:19] <smplstk> where-ass, lol
[13:00:28] <Brodingo> were ass
[13:00:37] <Brodingo> FULL MOON
[13:00:38] <Brodingo> GET IT
[13:00:41] <BinaryKitten> like a were-wolf except the person turns into an ass
[13:00:51] <ColKurtz> i forget why, but one time i couldn't use visibility:Hidden;
[13:00:55] <ColKurtz> OH it was because i wanted to fade it out
[13:01:01] <Brodingo> rgr maybe also opacity
[13:01:03] <ColKurtz> so i just faded to 0.0.1 opacity
[13:01:08] <Decoy__> :'(
[13:01:09] <r3v3rb> evening all :)
[13:01:13] <ColKurtz> 0.01 opacit*
[13:01:15] <ColKurtz> y]
[13:01:16] <ColKurtz> dammit
[13:01:17] <ColKurtz> lol
[13:01:18] <Decoy__> hey r3verb halp?
[13:01:22] <ColKurtz> and it was like visibility:hidden;
[13:01:33] <raygerrard> .css('display','hidden')
[13:01:42] <rgr> css("visibility:hidden") does the job since it maintains the display:style thanks.
[13:01:42] <ColKurtz> visibility
[13:01:43] <Brodingo> ehhhh
[13:01:44] <ColKurtz> not display
[13:02:19] <Brodingo> rgr but maybe put it in a class and so you dont have to use .css()
[13:02:19] <smplstk> display: lollercats;
[13:02:29] <r3v3rb> anyway I can improve this script to be more responsive when movnig between li's ? http://pastie.org/2696773
[13:02:30] <karega|aniasis> if I don't want to use jQuery('#' + errorKey) to target an element how can I target without adding the hash?
[13:02:46] <raygerrard> sorry .css('visibility','hidden')

[13:04:54] <Eightyk> hello, hopefully quick question. I'm trying to load contents from an invisible iframe on a page to a div else where on the same page. But the .load function doesnt seem to be working, it returns "null"
[13:04:56] <r3v3rb> yikes that sounds scary guys
[13:05:00] <Eightyk> http://pastebin.com/DXEZLZDT to see the code
[13:05:19] <Brodingo> oh god
[13:06:00] <r3v3rb> phlp easy to instigate ?
[13:06:11] <Brodingo> Eightyk you need to use $(document).ready(func);
[13:06:17] <Decoy__> hey can I get some halp?
[13:06:41] <Eightyk> @brodingo, i only want the script to run when the iframe is loaded though
[13:06:48] <Brodingo> Eightyk and if youre going to use a selector more than once, you should cache it
[13:06:53] <phlp> r3v3rb: $('#tg_stylists').delegate('li', 'mouseover', function(a) {
[13:06:59] <Brodingo> ohhh
[13:07:07] <Brodingo> use .load for iframes
[13:07:08] <Decoy__> Ok, so Im trying to get this element to appear to the right of another.
[13:07:10] <Decoy__> http://pastebin.com/vCm0tqxC
[13:07:14] <r3v3rb> phlp: okay i think i get what its doing :D
[13:07:17] <Decoy__> this is teh code. it is not working.
[13:07:26] <Decoy__> it keeps on appearing underneath.
[13:07:34] <Decoy__> instead of to the right
[13:09:25] <r3v3rb> phlp: should i change the mouseout to $('stylists').mouseout
[13:09:30] <Brodingo> Decoy__ have a container with the iframe and other element as siblings
[13:09:31] <Eightyk> erg, what brodingo? how do i pm you on the webchat?
[13:09:37] <Brodingo> and use left: 100%
[13:09:45] <Brodingo> Eightyk please dont
[13:11:35] <r3v3rb> phlp: switched the code but still doesn't fire the animation on rolling from one item to the other :(
[13:12:01] <Eightyk> @brodingo sorry im new to javascript, what did you say i needed to do? It's inserting "null" into the the page where the new html should be
[13:12:31] <Brodingo> Eightyk before you put on the big boy pants you should brush up on jquery fundementals
[13:12:35] <Brodingo> ?jqf @ Eightyk
[13:12:36] <bot-t> Eightyk, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[13:12:46] <phlp> r3v3rb: which animation? seems to be working
[13:14:09] <solidus-river> whats the best way to do an image swap with another image thats loaded on the page with jquery
[13:15:28] <phlp> r3v3rb: your beingShown var isnt going to work like you want. the var is the same one for all your mouseovers. you can use .is(':animated') on the tooltips
[13:16:19] <Eightyk> I'm a graphic designer thats just doing a quick project and I dont have the time to learn js completely (deadlines). Is there a specific section of that book that would help me get my problem solved?
[13:16:39] <saulo> Hello! I need some help with jquery. I'm using this upload plugin https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/   and when I use this file https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/jquery.fileupload-ui.js   I receive the error $.tmpl is not defined.    I'm using this with mootools, and I'm using $j = jQuery.noConflict();, and think my problem is near this....
[13:17:13] <saulo> I need add noConflict() first than load all files?
[13:18:52] <ries> hey guys, I need to post a form that include a file using a ajax request, I am using jquery.fileupload, but that sends to file as soon as I select it, and I don't want that. So I just want to send the file with a ajax request when a user presses a other button, is that possible?
[13:19:13] <Eightyk> @brodingo I'm a graphic designer thats just doing a quick project and I dont have the time to learn js completely (deadlines). Is there a specific section of that book that would help me get my problem solved?
[13:19:30] <Brodingo> Eightyk if youre a designer all you have to do is point and say "well, here is where a developer would make it do this..."
[13:19:36] <Brodingo> (im joking)
[13:19:43] <Eightyk> lol
[13:21:49] <phlp> Eightyk: "Note: The .live() and .delegate() methods cannot be used to detect the load event of an iframe." http://api.jquery.com/load-event
[13:22:17] <Brodingo> well Eightyk, and im not trying to be mean, but that is some really bad code with complete disregard for fundemental javascript conventions, and helping you refactor this stuff is kind of a hand holding exercise
[13:22:24] <oojacoboo> is cursor: pointer broken for anyone else on Canary?
[13:22:44] <oojacoboo> it's annoying the shit out of me
[13:22:46] <Eightyk> really? its copy / pasted from a blog post
[13:22:53] <r3v3rb> phlp sorry coffee time, the text anim (tooltip) is the one thats br0k3
[13:22:59] <oojacoboo> also actually had something else break today with Canary, which was quite strange
[13:23:37] <phlp> r3v3rb: i know, because the beingShown var is shared. it has the value from the first tooltip
[13:23:48] <Brodingo> Eightyk yikes
[13:23:56] <solidus-river> how do i get the second to last element from a list of elements?
[13:24:08] <r3v3rb> ok so loose the beingshown
[13:24:10] <glauco29> hi there
[13:24:27] <Brodingo> solidus-river .last().prev()
[13:24:36] <Brodingo> solidus-river or maybe .eq(-1) ....
[13:24:38] <r3v3rb> and use .is(::animated) instead?
[13:24:44] <raygerrard> @brodingo: when you say cache selector do you mean assign it to a variable?
[13:24:47] <Eightyk> @brodingo well sans the .ready part... i added that because it wasnt working at all... which i figured it wasnt working because it was running before the iframe loaded
[13:24:58] <Brodingo> raygerrard yes, $elem = $(element);
[13:25:10] <raygerrard> ok thanks
[13:25:22] <phlp> r3v3rb: yes and .is(':visible') instead of the shown var
[13:25:25] <Brodingo> Eightyk well like i said, use .load() instead of .ready() for iframes
[13:25:38] <Brodingo> Eightyk and the semicolons only need to go at the end of statements, not all lines
[13:25:54] <r3v3rb> ok phlp i'll give them a go
[13:25:57] <glauco29> I have a colorbox, it generates a div with overflow auto, I need a plugin to scroll the bar this div, I have tried use scrollTo but it roll up my page, not my lightbox. someone?
[13:26:13] <Eightyk> @brodingo, i thought that, but in the jquery api someone said that chome needed semicolons on each line
[13:26:53] <Brodingo> its like putting a metal bar in your bicycle spokes
[13:28:24] <Eightyk> @brodingo this is what i was trying to follow http://geekis.me/using-zen-cart-as-a-cart-only-system/
[13:28:55] <glauco29> I have a colorbox, it generates a div with overflow auto, I need a plugin to scroll the bar this div, I have tried use scrollTo but it roll up my page, not my lightbox. someone?
[13:29:38] <r3v3rb> haha phlp no tooltip now :D
[13:29:41] <Brodingo> glauco29 take another look at the docs, it should have tuts on that
[13:30:42] <phlp> r3v3rb: info.is(':animated') the tooltip is animated not the li
[13:30:58] <r3v3rb> ofcourse phlp my bad
[13:31:33] <ColKurtz> glauco29, could you isolate it and put it up on http://jsfiddle.net
[13:32:45] <glauco29> ColKurtz
[13:33:52] <Brodingo> glauco29 are you using $.scrollTo or $(elem).scrollTo
[13:34:12] <Decoy__> hey can I have some halp?
[13:34:12] <r3v3rb> phlp: still doesn't fire consecutively unless you pause for an unspecified amount
[13:34:26] <glauco29> Brodingo I have tried both ways
[13:34:49] <Brodingo> glauco29 maybe make sure the selector is correct
[13:34:58] <glauco29> It is correct
[13:35:09] <glauco29> the trouble is that
[13:35:09] <phlp> r3v3rb: it's because your mouseout is on the whole list
[13:35:26] <glauco29> I have a html code that is generated by colorbox plugin
[13:35:33] <r3v3rb> should i delegate that too ?
[13:35:49] <phlp> yep
[13:35:50] <glauco29> In a callback of colorbox
[13:36:05] <glauco29> I am performing a ajax request
[13:37:22] <Brodingo> glauco29  like ColKurtz said, a link would help
[13:37:32] <glauco29> ok
[13:37:36] <glauco29> one momment
[13:38:04] <phlp> r3v3rb: you are selecting all tooltips in the mouseout, instead of the one specific to 'this'
[13:38:22] <developernotes> I am trying to use the jquery ui icons with jquery templates, but with my current configuration (http://pastie.org/2696961) I get what appears to be multiple images directly overlayed on the text.  Any ideas on how to just get it to display the one info icon next to the text?
[13:38:31] <solidus-river> i think i'm using clone wrong
[13:38:39] <solidus-river> i have a set of matched elements and i tell it to clone
[13:38:42] <solidus-river> it returns undefined
[13:38:44] <r3v3rb> okay so how can i pass 'this one to the mouse out ow that mouseover is a delegate
[13:39:27] <phlp> r3v3rb: select it the same way you do in mouseover $(".tooltip", this) or $(this).find('.tooltip')
[13:39:38] <oojacoboo> anyone know the key for the chrome room?
[13:39:44] <thun> I have a selectbox that pulls an ajax request on select... when i get the reposonse I set some form fields with the results of the ajax json call. All works fine... but if I set a checkbox as checked ajaxStop does not get called by jquery
[13:39:56] <thun> why would this happen? here is the checkbox code
[13:40:04] <oojacoboo> or know where I can talk with some of the chrome guys?
[13:40:08] <thun> select.parent().parent().find(":input[id*='LineTaxable']").prop("checked", Boolean( parseInt( data.Product.tax_id)  )    ); 									
[13:40:25] <thun> the code works fine
[13:40:34] <thun> but if it is called no ajaxstop is called after the ajax call
[13:40:46] <thun> if i comment that one line above out it works fine and ajaxstop fires
[13:40:47] <Faerris> hey all! is there an easy way for me to move a section of text to another part of the page using jquery?
[13:40:57] <r3v3rb> haha, almost now they dont disappear phlp :D
[13:41:10] <Brodingo> Faerris yes there is!
[13:41:13] <phlp> r3v3rb: you had the right idea before, get rid of all the hideDelayTimer stuff
[13:41:17] <Brodingo> ?text @ Faerris
[13:41:18] <bot-t> Faerris, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[13:41:20] <r3v3rb> ok
[13:42:31] <braddunbar> Has anyone ever used jQuery.dotdotdot.js before?  (http://dotdotdot.frebsite.nl/)  If so how was your experience?
[13:42:59] <braddunbar> The code looks fairly solid, but I've been bitten by truncators that get caught in a loop before...
[13:43:21] <phlp> r3v3rb: (but not the :animated and :visible)
[13:43:24] <Eightyk> :( http://geekis.me/using-zen-cart-as-a-cart-only-system/ ... the stuff he wrote in there is correct?
[13:45:18] <Faerris> sweet thanks Brodingo :)
[13:45:37] <r3v3rb> whaaaaa, no tooltips again phlp  :P
[13:45:45] <phlp> r3v3rb: let me rephrase. only remove lines with hideDelayTimer in them
[13:46:20] <r3v3rb> yes i did and put back the is animated
[13:47:04] <phlp> r3v3rb: but you removed the return. it cant be animated before it is animated
[13:49:07] <ries> anybody happen to know a jqeury upload plugin that sends the file only on submit?
[13:49:15] <ries> I find a lot of them that auto-uploads, but I don't want that!
[13:51:08] <phlp> r3v3rb: extra } before return false
[13:51:33] <r3v3rb> ;) check again phlp  :)
[13:51:42] <r3v3rb> i had removed the else above by accident
[13:52:11] <r3v3rb> so close but not quite right… phlp
[13:53:05] <phlp> r3v3rb: you still have a $('.tooltip') in the mouseout, it's hiding them all
[13:53:29] <snorkelpanda> hi
[13:53:40] <r3v3rb> god damnit i am a fool !
[13:54:17] <ragas> $('<p>Test</p>').appendTo('.inner'); is an example from jQ to insert some code into an element.  I want to embed a var.  I tried $(myVar).appendTo('#myElem'); No go.  How should i do this?
[13:55:03] <phlp> ? data @ ragas
[13:55:04] <r3v3rb> phlp: changed but still the same
[13:55:04] <bot-t> ragas, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:55:32] <namelessjon> If an element is overflowing, is there a way in jquery to find the height of the content?
[13:56:09] <Decoy__> well you all suck and I figuredit out myself so go to hell
[13:56:22] <context> your welcome.
[13:57:25] <context> ragas: uhhh what ?
[13:57:42] <context> im hoping what you wanted is what phlp sent you
[13:58:54] <r3v3rb> phlp: i think its because if i move quickly then 'this' changes context in the mouseout event
[13:59:26] <context> this will be whatever you attached the event listener to
[13:59:45] <kamaji> How can I select the first img element in a subtree ?
[14:00:06] <Brodingo> .find('img').eq(0)
[14:00:07] <kamaji> I have some element "elem", so I want to do something like $(elem).children().find("img")
[14:00:11] <phlp> r3v3rb: your info var is declared before the callbacks like your beingShown was. use 'var info' inside the callbacks
[14:00:21] <kamaji> Brodingo: that seems to pick up a wrapping element as well
[14:00:41] <context> kamaji: http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[14:00:56] <r3v3rb> phlp: scope gotcha !
[14:01:00] <Brodingo> kamaji what? :)
[14:01:37] <r3v3rb> phlp: thanks for the patience ;)
[14:02:07] <phlp> r3v3rb: no problem :) it's looking good
[14:02:09] <Brodingo> kamaji .children('img:first')
[14:02:12] <ravenzz> he's going to send you the bill np
[14:02:34] <ravenzz> find('img:first')
[14:02:34] <kamaji> Brodingo: erm, hang on... ^^
[14:02:35] <ravenzz> ?
[14:02:41] <r3v3rb> thank you phlp - with a little phlp from my friends :D
[14:03:29] <kamaji> They don't seem to match
[14:03:32] <Brodingo> kamaji children() is for direct decendents, .find() will go deeper, filter() narrows down a selection
[14:03:36] <kamaji> the img isn't a direct descendent
[14:03:38] <kamaji> oh
[14:03:46] <kamaji> and first() just returns the first element matched?
[14:03:56] <Brodingo> yeah, lots of ways to do that
[14:04:04] <Brodingo> .eq(0) .first() :first
[14:04:50] <kamaji> Hmm. .find("img").first() doesn't seem to be matching anything :\
[14:05:00] <kamaji> even though I know it's in there...
[14:05:09] <snorkelpanda> has anyone else had a problem with jqery-ui-autocomplete breaking the browser feature where it remembers values people have entered for form fields?
[14:05:20] <Brodingo> gotta go, good luck
[14:05:22] <kamaji> i tried .children().first("img") but that returns the img wrapped in something
[14:05:25] <snorkelpanda> like if they leave and come back to the form ...
[14:05:25] <kamaji> thanks
[14:05:31] <ravenzz> ?demo @ kamaji
[14:05:32] <bot-t> kamaji, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:05:42] <snorkelpanda> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7773529/jquery-ui-autocomplete-breaks-browser-storage-of-filled-form-fields
[14:06:35] <snorkelpanda> that looks neat - checking it out
[14:15:57] <gnarf> snorkelpanda: its beause autocomplete sets autocomplete="off" on the element i think
[14:16:07] <gnarf> snorkelpanda: nothing can be done about it afaik
[14:16:15] <rgr> I'm intrigued, do you ever contribute anything other than telling people to provide a demo which you then ignore?
[14:16:23] <sente> wg 20
[14:17:36] <gnarf> also snorkelpanda did you just post that?
[14:19:35] <Faerris> Okay with your help I sort of figured my problem out
[14:20:40] <Faerris> I need to place text after a form, the problem is, I only have access to add scripts to the header, so I need to delay the loading of this Javascript till after the form loads, how might i do that?
[14:21:46] <kborchers> ?ready @ Faerris
[14:21:47] <bot-t> Faerris, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[14:22:02] <kamaji> is $("selector") equivalent to doing document.find("selector") ?
[14:22:03] <Faerris> awesome thank you kborchers
[14:22:16] <Faerris> i'm just learning JS and Jquery
[14:22:16] <Faerris> :)
[14:23:06] <kamaji> or even $(document).find("selector")
[14:23:16] <oojacoboo> is Canary just REALLY buggy?
[14:23:17] <blazedd> I'm having a hell of a party with $(window).height(). Anyone know of a better way to do this that won't result in a random error?
[14:26:56] <phlp> blazedd: window.innerHeight or document.body.clientHeight ?
[14:27:21] <PlzHelp> Any jQuery experts want to take a stab at this?  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7758931  *Free virtual beer to anyone who can answer.
[14:27:40] <blazedd> Document works really well, however I need the height of the window.
[14:27:54] <blazedd> It's wierd as if polling for the height of the window causes the error
[14:28:02] <blazedd> check console: http://proeffect.blazed-designs.com/filemanager.html
[14:28:44] <blazedd> I double checked my simple code, did the math on paper and then still it refuses to work for me. And to top it all off: The error isn't insightful one bit
[14:28:47] <rns> anyone know if I can get mouseover help text on my forms in django?
[14:29:09] <kborchers> PlzHelp: why not just use a single checkbox and validate that it's checked ... problem solved ;)
[14:29:22] <phlp> blazedd: nothing in the console on FF6
[14:30:06] <blazedd> phlp: resize the window a bit
[14:30:16] <blazedd> should get "Container is not defined"
[14:30:27] <blazedd> I see it on FF6 and Chrome
[14:31:30] <blazedd> time to get an unminimized version of jquery to see what's going on
[14:31:53] <phlp> says its in some google chart javascript
[14:32:40] <blazedd> o.0 I love you
[14:32:46] <blazedd> how did I miss that....
[14:33:01] <blazedd> brb gonna go sweep up the hair I pulled from the past hour
[14:38:29] <PlzHelp> kborchers, thats what I ended up doing but not ideally what I wanted. thank you though
[14:41:55] <gnarf> ?twss
[14:41:56] <bot-t> <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[14:42:07] <Faerris> okay guys thanks for all your help so far. one last question. i'm using $(document).ready(function () { ............. });  and I'd like to execute some PHP in there... how do I do that? Just placing <?php my stuff ?> doesn't work
[14:42:08] <gnarf> shit
[14:42:19] <gnarf> awesome
[14:42:32] <Faerris> i've been googling for an answer and can't seem to find one
[14:42:59] <phlp> answer: not possible
[14:43:09] <Faerris> yeah i just found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6116931/run-php-function-inside-jquery-click
[14:43:10] <Faerris> :(
[14:43:28] <Eviltwin> Ha
[14:43:29] <gnarf> i was scared bot-t was missing
[14:43:29] <gnarf> i was gonna go on strike
[14:45:57] <Eviltwin> ?faq
[14:45:57] <bot-t> FAQ: http://docs.jquery.com/FAQ
[14:50:07] <kamaji> ... can I use jquery to modify an element not in the DOM?
[14:50:46] <Brodingo> yes
[14:51:23] <kamaji> that's $(myElem).do().stuff() right?
[14:51:31] <kamaji> if it's not already a jquery element that is
[14:51:39] <Brodingo> correct
[14:51:44] <sadmicrowave> hey guys, have two ui buttons inside a ui-dialog element.  I want to align the first button left and the other button right...how would I do this?
[14:51:56] <kamaji> ok, thanks
[14:52:01] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: float?
[14:52:25] <sadmicrowave> gnarf, I've tried float, margin-left, left, offset().left and none of these seem to move the element at all
[14:53:39] <phlp> are you sure it's selected?
[14:53:57] <sadmicrowave> yes, I console.log() the element and it is what I'm expecting
[14:54:26] <sadmicrowave> $('button[name="Workmanship"]', '.ui-dialog:first-child').css('margin-left', '5px');
[14:54:34] <Brodingo> no demo : noodling :: demo : shooting a fish in the face with a sniper rifle
[14:55:19] <sadmicrowave> heres this I was playing around with (just providing so you don't have to make your own testing sample) http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/8WFxF/4/
[14:59:43] <raygerrard> anyone know how i can return the id of a sortable element when using the deactivate callback?
[15:00:10] <raygerrard> ie. when i drop the element i would like to know its id
[15:00:40] <raygerrard> i have tried using $(this).attr('id); with the deactive callback function but it is undefined
[15:01:02] <phlp> sadmicrowave: $('.ui-dialog .ui-dialog-buttonset').css('width','100%').find('button:last').css('float','right');
[15:01:33] <rgr> calling reset() on form elements is resetting them to empty. How to I buffer/store the initial values I really want reset to revert the form to?
[15:02:25] <raygerrard> anyone?
[15:03:01] <sadmicrowave> phlp, thanks dude
[15:03:12] <juha_> ttp://imgur.com/gallery/CKShf and i found fat, beautiful and sad. this. is. madness.
[15:03:14] <gnarf> rgr: .prop("defaultValue" ?
[15:03:59] <gnarf> phlp: or just add .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-buttonset { width: 100%; } in the css? :)
[15:04:16] <phlp> raygerrard: just a guess but maybe deactivate: function(e, ui) { ui.item.id }
[15:04:58] <gnarf> phlp: likely ui.item is a jQuery of the draggable thing
[15:05:49] <rgr> not sure how I see that helps in reset condition. notmal form reset button resets values to the initial values.
[15:06:01] <gnarf> so .attr('id') might work, but like why do you need the id, you already have the thing itself
[15:06:01] <gnarf> just inspect the ui event parameter
[15:06:14] <sadmicrowave> ok, next question, I'm trying to figure out how to utilize the predefined ui-icons that you can view on the dialog theme page. for example: I want my button text to be "Open " + $('.ui-icon-folder-open') but that displays "Open [object, object]".  How do I go about using the icons
[15:07:31] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-pencil inline-flow"></span>
[15:07:38] <raygerrard> @gnarf: in the callback i will be making an ajax call so i need to pass the id as i will be storing a unique id on template render
[15:07:39] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-pencil"></span>
[15:07:45] <gnarf> sorry coppied from something else
[15:07:57] <raygerrard> then change location in the db
[15:08:07] <gnarf> raygerrard: nice, just make sure you find the item, then like use the item... pretty easy
[15:08:30] <raygerrard> ty
[15:09:25] <sadmicrowave> gnarf, I can't put that in my button: { text: .... }; area though because it will come out as a literal string....
[15:10:02] <gnarf> sadmicrowave: then append it to the button after you make it
[15:10:09] <sadmicrowave> gnarf, can do
[15:10:23] <phlp> you can set it on the create event of the dialog, or call button() with the icons: { primary: 'ui-icon' }
[15:18:29] <ProLoser|Work> did chrome just change their inspector?
[15:18:39] <ProLoser|Work> i don't know why, but now inspector is pausing on all errors
[15:19:38] <jaequery> what do you guys get when you go here?  http://jsfiddle.net/kcwnN/2/   ?  i get 9/111,    how about you?    ..... i don't know why it's not returning the current date .... =x
[15:20:51] <phlp> (v.getYear() + 1900)
[15:21:40] <phlp> or v.getFullYear()
[15:22:15] <raygerrard> is there any reason the deactivate callback is fire twice if you are using connectwith? using receive instead this doesnt occur but am interested to know why this happens
[15:25:32] <raygerrard> looking at the docs it would seem it fires for each list when sorting stops
[15:30:08] <Snerf> getting the position.left() of an object, seems to return decimals when the browser (chrome) is zoomed in. so instead of 209, it is like 208.33, any idea why it does this?
[15:30:12] <rgr> Im a getting an error from within jquery http://pastebin.com/eGp9DiaT  : $("#centercontainer #id" + id).after(newe).remove(); where newe is defined and valid.
[15:30:19] <Snerf> position().left, that is
[15:30:32] <rgr> familiar with what cause that?
[15:39:40] <Snerf> http://jsfiddle.net/4XHaN/1/ <- here is an example, runs 10 by default, zoom in, and its like 9.8..... ,, why does it do that?
[15:51:28] <cruxst> holler
[15:55:13] <SEToChan> what i did wrong here http://govnokod.com/5523
[15:55:44] <SEToChan> trying start my own plugin i just getting $("body").dialog is not a function
[16:10:45] <devc> Hey guys -- It's Friday and I have a bus to catch in 10 minutes or else I have to stay for another hour so I'm being lame and asking someone to bail me out on the last bit of code I'm working on :)
[16:11:48] <devc> I have a navigational highlighting system that's worked but having restructured some of the HTML I'm rejigging it to work as well.
[16:11:54] <coldhead> more bugs less back story
[16:11:59] <devc> haha
[16:12:17] <devc> When you click the Prev/Next buttons it highlights but when you click on an actual nav item it doesn't... Enough with the backstory, here's a url
[16:12:25] <devc> http://tinyurl.com/4xc97wn
[16:12:53] <devc> the highlight function can be found in jquery.parallax.js
[16:13:32] <devc> it gets called on item click on line 164, and the highlight function itself is on 485.
[16:13:58] <oojacoboo> hey, I have a click(function(event) that fires fine on this page if you refresh your browser.  If you go to another page (ajax ui) and back to this page, it will fire the first time, then fails… any ideas where I could look for this issue or on how I might debug it… it's just frustrating!
[16:15:59] <coldhead> devc: this looks very nice
[16:16:02] <coldhead> but i don't see any thumbnails
[16:16:13] <coldhead> so i can't see it not highlighting
[16:16:19] <coldhead> is my screen too puny or something?
[16:16:30] <devc> Sorry. The thumbnails are a sprite along the footer.
[16:16:49] <coldhead> i just see a left and right arrow
[16:16:55] <devc> Hmm the footer sholdn't get covered at any resolution (although the rest does... let's not talk about that)
[16:16:58] <devc> Oh really?
[16:17:00] <devc> hold on.
[16:17:37] <devc> sorry man, if you hard refresh, I forgot to upload the stylesheet
[16:18:01] <devc> you can speed up the intro by clicking on the logo and the sign instantly
[16:18:26] <coldhead> the thumbs are <!-- commented --> out in the html
[16:18:29] <coldhead> for me
[16:18:36] <devc> when you click the prev/next arrows you'll see the names ump up 4 px.
[16:18:54] <coldhead> k got them now
[16:18:55] <devc> Try a hard refresh while holding shift.
[16:19:01] <devc> Sorry about that.
[16:19:30] <oojacoboo> devc: that doesn't work in chrome FYI
[16:19:35] <oojacoboo> I was asking about that crap the other day
[16:19:41] <devc> the shift refresh or the site?
[16:19:50] <oojacoboo> shift refresh
[16:20:04] <devc> How do you do it? Clearing cache only?
[16:20:16] <oojacoboo> just plain ole refresh does it it seems
[16:20:26] <oojacoboo> it's still a bit more mysterious to me than I'd like
[16:20:50] <coldhead> devc: the highlight is the text moving up, right?
[16:21:00] <devc> coldhead: yessir.
[16:21:00] <oojacoboo> it's like in FF, two subsequent refreshes clear the cache
[16:21:07] <oojacoboo> as well as shift refresh
[16:21:15] <coldhead> that seems to be working fine, it's just that you have a hover that moves it back when you move the mouse out
[16:21:20] <devc> oojacoboo: Yeah. That's nice.
[16:21:30] <coldhead> if i trigger the click from the console the thumb stays raised
[16:22:20] <devc> Dang so is there a way for me to check if the hovered thumb has the class "selected"?
[16:22:43] <oojacoboo> devc: in firebug you can see it added while inspecting
[16:22:45] <coldhead> if ($(this).is('.selected'))
[16:23:14] <oojacoboo> I'd assume the same in chrome, although, I'm not certain
[16:25:14] <devc> coldhead: That works perfectly
[16:25:15] <devc> Thanks guys!
[16:25:19] <devc> I'm outta hererunning for this bus
[16:25:24] <devc> I'll log in on monday and thank you again
[16:25:25] <devc> THANKS! :)
[16:26:28] <Elephant> is $('table#myId') faster than $('#myId')?
[16:26:31] <Elephant> should I care?
[16:26:54] <Elephant> kinda general question I suppose.
[16:27:20] <coldhead> Elephant: pure ID should be faster
[16:27:31] <coldhead> because the browser can fetch it directly
[16:27:48] <coldhead> BUT table#id can be more readable
[16:27:49] <Elephant> oh okay
[16:27:55] <Elephant> k
[16:28:06] <coldhead> so it depends what you're writing for :)
[16:28:14] <Elephant> yeah, I kinda realized after asking, that it would depend on quite a few things
[16:28:37] <imsky> OH ITS FRIDAY
[16:28:54] <Elephant> flood friday?
[16:29:14] <imsky> are you implying something
[16:29:48] <Elephant> only that I'm curious if this channel celebrated.

[16:41:35] <linusoleander> I'm having some strange problems with $.ajax doing OPTIONS requests to my server instead of GET and POST
[16:41:47] <linusoleander> Can anyone explain to me what an OPTIONS request is?
[16:42:28] <coldhead> toddmorrill: i doubt you will wind a more perfect resource than jqfundamentals
[16:42:40] <coldhead> ?g jqfundamentals
[16:42:41] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[16:42:55] <toddmorrill> thanks
[16:44:43] <linusoleander> Anyone
[16:44:44] <linusoleander> ?
[16:45:46] <kamaji> if I have a set of elements called "elems" created from html e.g. like this: var elems = $('<div><br/></div> <div></br></div>'), should elems.unwrap("div > *") get rid of those divs but preserve their content?
[16:46:14] <coldhead> linusoleander: OPTIONS is a request type that isn't very well supported :(
[16:46:52] <linusoleander> coldhead: Why is $.ajax using OPTIONS when I've told it to use PUT
[16:46:53] <linusoleander> ?
[16:46:57] <coldhead> kamaji: what happens if you try it? paste is on jsfiddle and let's see
[16:47:09] <coldhead> linusoleander: PUT is also not very well supported
[16:47:16] <coldhead> maybe it's better supported than OPTIONS
[16:47:31] <linusoleander> coldhead: That wan't my question :p
[16:47:35] <coldhead> but most people limit themselves to get and post
[16:47:53] <coldhead> rails fakes the others and just uses post and get, for example
[16:47:53] <juha_> huh
[16:48:04] <juha_> good night folks
[16:49:01] <linusoleander> coldhead: But why isn't put being used?
[16:50:06] <kamaji> coldhead: nope, doesn't seem to do anything
[16:50:11] <kamaji> http://jsfiddle.net/QfxfL/
[16:50:31] <kamaji> oops, wrong library
[16:50:31] <kamaji> hah
[16:50:45] <kamaji> still doesn't remove the inner divs tho
[16:55:15] <toddmorrill> can someone reccomend a learning turorial thats grounded in the learning in something thats actually cool ( i wan to end up with something like http://www.isseymiyake.com/isseymiyake_women/ after i finish the learning turial
[16:55:43] <coldhead> linusoleander: i assume you saw this: The type of request to make ("POST" or "GET"), default is "GET". Note: Other HTTP request methods, such as PUT and DELETE, can also be used here, but they are not supported by all browsers.
[16:56:02] <toddmorrill> layers of learing from 0 -> advanced grouned in the building of an actual application (like jobeet for symfony)
[16:56:11] <linusoleander> coldhead: No, that isn't what I saw
[16:56:32] <linusoleander> I tried to do a PUT request and a OPTIONS request was made, why?
[16:58:11] <coldhead> i'm not trying to frustrate you, linusoleander, i just know that types other than POST and GET are a world of pain
[16:58:20] <coldhead> let's see what the source says
[16:58:43] <linusoleander> coldhead: This application will only be used in a chromium browser
[16:59:07] <linusoleander> So i don't think that will be a problem
[16:59:15] <coldhead> test: i don't know of anything that takes you from 0 to that particular site, it's just a combination of techniques
[16:59:19] <coldhead> maybe try sitepoint
[17:00:48] <coldhead> linusoleander: it could be the browser, it could be jQuery
[17:00:59] <coldhead> i'm looking to see if jQ does anything special with OPTIONS
[17:03:46] <sadmicrowave> how can I push a variable into a specific element of an array? myArray[0].push( val ); is not valid
[17:04:05] <coldhead> myArray[0] = val
[17:04:20] <sadmicrowave> i knew that answer was coming the second I typed that question
[17:04:21] <sadmicrowave> lol
[17:04:25] <sadmicrowave> fml
[17:04:37] <coldhead> aw don't be like that
[17:04:38] <coldhead> it's okay!
[17:05:04] <coldhead> linusoleander: i can't find anything special in jQuery about PUT or OPTIONS
[17:05:26] <coldhead> and looking into OPTIONS and CORS is reminding me why i never have the patience to get my head around this :(
[17:05:41] <coldhead> i suspect the browser is responsible, not jQuery
[17:05:50] <coldhead> jaubourg is the guy to ask
[17:05:53] <coldhead> if he's ever around
[17:08:26] <coldhead> linusoleander: this might be userful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5750696/how-to-get-a-cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors-post-request-working/5753269#5753269
[17:11:08] <coldhead> kamaji: http://jsfiddle.net/QfxfL/8/
[17:24:19] <Axsuul> in $.getScript(..), what is this parameter that's being appended to the url?  _=1929319239
[17:24:36] <coldhead> a cache buster>
[17:24:39] <coldhead> ?
[17:25:23] <Axsuul> thanks
[17:25:24] <Axsuul> thats it
[17:25:29] <sadmicrowave> can I use 'break;' to break out of a $('element').each(function(){...}); loop?
[17:25:40] <coldhead> return false;
[17:25:44] <sadmicrowave> nice
[17:28:36] <cypha> hey coldhead
[17:29:17] <coldhead> hallo!
[17:29:25] <coldhead> happy weekend, cypha
[17:29:27] <coldhead> you made it

[17:30:24] <coldhead> australia!
[17:30:25] <cypha> why's that?
[17:30:30] <cypha> oh, that was my second guess
[17:30:32] <coldhead> sounds like austria but is other place entirely
[17:30:34] <cypha> (cuz of timings)
[17:30:39] <cypha> thought germany cuz of the "hallo"
[17:31:08] <cypha> so ready for my daily double?
[17:31:24] <coldhead> oh hallo is just pretension
[17:31:32] <cypha> snooty?
[17:31:41] <coldhead> exactly
[17:31:47] <cypha> haha
[17:31:48] <coldhead> i'm better than most people etc
[17:31:59] <cypha> well, at least in #jquery
[17:32:03] <cypha> =P
[17:33:05] <Looo> Hello
[17:33:11] <cypha> coldhead, I'm having trouble figuring out what is styling <div class="fileupload"> here--> http://68.198.22.26:8000/xyz (once you login with xyz:xyz) I don't see it in the stylesheets, so I'm thinking it must be js. (click "Change Picture" when hovering over the image to see the div)
[17:34:52] <coldhead> i don't see a fileupload
[17:35:00] <eddiemonge> hover over the big head
[17:35:10] <eddiemonge> nothing is really styling it
[17:35:14] <coldhead> hahahha best description ever
[17:35:21] <coldhead> "hover over the big head"
[17:35:33] <cypha> coldhead, you can only see it when you log in
[17:35:43] <eddiemonge> cypha: what are you asking? that div isnt really "styled"
[17:36:05] <coldhead> http://68.198.22.26:8000/static/js/jQuery-File-Upload/jquery.fileupload-ui.css
[17:36:11] <coldhead> it's all from there
[17:36:20] <cypha> oh, hmm
[17:36:40] <coldhead> firebug/web inspector will helpfully tell you what's defined where when you Inspect Element
[17:36:45] <coldhead> and look at the CSS panel
[17:36:57] <cypha> i changed <div id="fileupload"> to <div class="fileupload"> and it didn't break
[17:37:13] <eddiemonge> again, because that div isnt styled.
[17:37:18] <eddiemonge> what are you trying to do?
[17:37:18] <cypha> but when I changed it to <div class="asdf"> or <div id="asdf">, it broke
[17:37:36] <Looo> speak spanish ?
[17:37:42] <cypha> basically, I want mine to look plain like this http://www.persturesson.com/fileupload/
[17:38:08] <RockMeAmadeus> Is #jquery logged?
[17:38:10] <cypha> and secondly, I want to be able to change <div class="fileupload"> to another name, so I can distinguish it from another upload form I want on the same page
[17:38:15] <eddiemonge> like a link instead of a button?
[17:38:36] <cypha> eddiemonge, basically I want it totally plain so I can then easily style it myself
[17:39:19] <cypha> but when I change the name "fileupload" to something else, it breaks the css (maybe even the code, didn't try that)
[17:39:35] <eddiemonge> take out the css file then
[17:39:40] <cypha> so if I want to change that name, what else would I have to change in the js/css?
[17:39:41] <eddiemonge> RockMeAmadeus: sometimes
[17:40:32] <cypha> eddiemonge, could I just use the css file of the website I linked you just now?
[17:41:21] <cypha> anyway, besides that (I'll play with the css)... how come changing "fileupload" to "asdf" breaks the css
[17:41:43] <cypha> if that div isn't technically styled
[17:42:38] <eddiemonge> because the rest of the stuff below it looks to that as its parent styler
[17:43:21] <JohnnyDavidson> Why does $(x).css('top') keep returning auto?
[17:43:29] <coldhead> ?logs
[17:43:29] <bot-t> Logs: http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery
[17:43:42] <eddiemonge> JohnnyDavidson: does that element have a top defined?
[17:44:00] <JohnnyDavidson> Shouldn't it have it defined automatically?
[17:44:12] <eddiemonge> it is. its "auto"
[17:44:24] <JohnnyDavidson> How can I tell where it is on the page then?
[17:44:29] <cypha> eddiemonge, but it's not styled, as you said
[17:44:35] <cypha> where is it mentioned as a "parent"?
[17:44:37] <eddiemonge> ?offset @ JohnnyDavidson
[17:44:38] <bot-t> JohnnyDavidson, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[17:45:01] <eddiemonge> cypha: right. thats not styled but the js file uses that as its reference to style the child elements. i would guess.
[17:46:18] <cypha> eddiemonge, so basically the js would break (in functionality as well) if I change that name?
[17:46:33] <eddiemonge> probably. i havent looked at the actual plugin though
[17:46:41] <eddiemonge> how is the thing called?
[17:46:48] <cypha> I need to rename every instance of 'fileupload' throughout all the js files
[17:46:56] <cypha> jquery-file-upload
[17:47:17] <eddiemonge> not what, but how
[17:47:58] <underplay> I need to add an image for a:hover, i cant add any styles to the <head> in this scenario..would onhover="..." be the best way?
[17:48:37] <linusoleander> I'm getting "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." when trying to do a request to my server.
[17:48:37] <linusoleander> I've set 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' to * on the server side, do I've do change anything else?
[17:48:56] <eddiemonge> underplay: sure
[17:49:04] <eddiemonge> ?sop @ linusoleander
[17:49:04] <bot-t> linusoleander, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[17:49:32] <linusoleander> eddiemonge: Using Access-Control-Allow-Origin shouldn't work?
[17:49:49] <eddiemonge> linusoleander: depends on the browser i think
[17:49:59] <linusoleander> I'm using Chrome
[17:50:35] <eddiemonge> linusoleander: origin null? the null doesnt sound right
[18:06:29] <SlickNik> Hello guys
[18:06:40] <SlickNik> JQuery newbie here
[18:06:50] <SlickNik> Had a quickquestion
[18:07:10] <SlickNik> If any one is around.
[18:08:13] <SlickNik> I have a div DOM element in a variable that I'm trying to wrap with another div.
[18:09:03] <linusoleander> I'm not sure if I understand this, but should this work?
[18:09:03] <linusoleander> https://gist.github.com/023aab2e66f38e8c51a0
[18:09:25] <linusoleander> Right now the random param is being ignored
[18:09:30] <SlickNik> So I have something like:
[18:09:30] <SlickNik> var = $var.wrap("<div class='wrapper' />");
[18:09:58] <SlickNik> doesn't seem to be working correctly, though...
[18:10:26] <SlickNik> any ideas?
[18:18:58] <Spadeski> SlickNik its the /> maybe creating a diff thing from the ascii chart
[18:19:36] <Spadeski> or var = $(this).wrap("");
[18:29:45] <spaek> hi.. i've got x number of divs with the same class name.. what i am trying to do is distinct each of the divs, so that i can hide/show them individually.. i can't seem to wrap my head around the approach of this problem
[18:29:47] <spaek> any ideas?
[18:34:33] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there a way to find out the height and width of test?
[18:34:34] <JohnnyDavidson> text*
[18:40:44] <rgr> in what measurements?
[19:11:32] <DrPoole> good evening.
[19:15:38] <oojacoboo> this this.id valid?
[19:15:46] <oojacoboo> or do I need this.attr('id')?
[19:16:46] <aro> is there a reason that in chrome/safari - show/hiding fields causes their position to change?
[19:17:28] <oojacoboo> aro: b/c that's how the DOM box model works
[19:17:43] <oojacoboo> use visibility: hidden/visible
[19:17:46] <dhruvasagar> go ubu
[19:19:05] <aro> got it
[19:19:11] <DrPoole> Hello.  Excuse the broad question.  I have a number of divs -- each representing a document the user can convert to a pdf.  HTML => PDF.  When they click "Generate" it sends a server side call via ajax to put it into the queue.  I'd like to have a "listener" which is checking on the status of these processes.  Is this a task for rabbitmq/gearman/etc, or could I possibly write something in jQuery?
[19:19:25] <MagusOTB> quit
[19:19:37] <DrPoole> my jQuery solution was....bad
[19:19:59] <DrPoole> im basically doing an ajax call to a php which is waiting for it to finish.  so jQuery is waiting for a 200.  Chrome doesn't like this.
[19:21:42] <aro> oojacoboo: it happens when i change the html contents too
[19:21:53] <oojacoboo> change the html contents??
[19:22:09] <DrPoole> aro: are you injecting tr's or something?
[19:22:15] <oojacoboo> *inserting
[19:22:16] <aro> i have an element absolutely positioned 12px from the right, and if it is <span>Test</span> and i change it to <span>Test1234</span> it gets offset
[19:22:17] <aro> no
[19:22:36] <oojacoboo> aro: span from what?
[19:22:46] <oojacoboo> also, is it STILL absolutely positioned?
[19:22:50] <aro> yes
[19:22:53] <oojacoboo> yes what
[19:22:59] <oojacoboo> that was two questions
[19:23:11] <aro> i didnt understand the first
[19:23:18] <oojacoboo> what was the element to begin with?
[19:23:29] <oojacoboo> span?
[19:23:30] <aro> a span
[19:23:48] <oojacoboo> how do you know it's STILL absolute positioned?
[19:23:54] <aro> i inspected the element
[19:23:58] <aro> do you have chrome/safari?
[19:24:16] <aro> can you take a look at an example?
[19:24:34] <oojacoboo> I guess
[19:24:39] <aro> https://www.anx.com/secure/user/register
[19:24:51] <oojacoboo> ok explain please
[19:25:03] <aro> see where it says 'REQUIRED' in the input fields
[19:25:10] <aro> on the right
[19:25:12] <oojacoboo> yea
[19:25:18] <aro> start typing in the field
[19:25:21] <aro> and it will disappear
[19:25:23] <oojacoboo> k
[19:25:41] <oojacoboo> remove text and it's messed up
[19:25:41] <aro> now, delete what you typed - and tab out of the field or click somewhere else
[19:25:42] <oojacoboo> I see
[19:25:44] <oojacoboo> yea
[19:26:10] <DrPoole> here's a better, more direction question perhaps.  Is there a way of making an ajax call to a URL every 10 seconds?  Eg:  I can't seem to find a non-hack way to sleep()
[19:26:16] <DrPoole> can delay() be used with .ajax?
[19:26:30] <aro> DrPoole: setInterval?
[19:27:45] <oojacoboo> aro: don't remove the content, change the visibility to hidden
[19:27:51] <aro> ok
[19:27:52] <oojacoboo> then visibility: visible;
[19:28:50] <aro> that works
[19:28:51] <aro> why
[19:28:59] <oojacoboo> b/c I am a css god
[19:29:07] <oojacoboo> and suck shit at js and jquery
[19:29:33] <aro> i see why
[19:29:35] <aro> its the width
[19:29:46] <aro> its shrinking to 0 width when you remove the text
[19:29:50] <oojacoboo> yes
[19:29:55] <aro> when you reinsert the text, it doesnt adapt the width
[19:29:59] <aro> so it hangs off to the right
[19:30:04] <aro> why is it only webkit that does that
[19:30:05] <aro> thats odd
[19:30:10] <oojacoboo> and then when you add it back it starts at that same point, it's not re painting b/c it's absolute positioned
[19:30:24] <aro> so just give it a width then?
[19:30:24] <oojacoboo> aro: you could try overflow: hidden;
[19:30:56] <oojacoboo> just make it the same width as the input and text-align: right?
[19:31:09] <oojacoboo> I dunno, you need different text?
[19:31:23] <oojacoboo> toggling visibility is MUCH better than messing with the content
[19:31:45] <aro> yeah the text changes
[19:31:54] <oojacoboo> you could try overflow: hidden
[19:31:58] <oojacoboo> see if that does the trick
[19:32:07] <oojacoboo> if not, yea, set a width
[19:32:10] <aro> wouldnt that just hide the content that flows out of the box?
[19:32:34] <oojacoboo> aro: yes and no, it forces the box model
[19:32:40] <aro> hmm ok
[19:32:46] <oojacoboo> it's also how you control floats
[19:32:58] <oojacoboo> it causes the browser to dbl check itself ;)
[19:33:07] <aro> cool it works
[19:33:24] <oojacoboo> you can also do, element:after {content: ''; }
[19:33:33] <aro> k
[19:33:37] <oojacoboo> yea… these are the easy things ;)
[19:33:41] <aro> hehe
[19:34:26] <oojacoboo> aro: can I do…. this.id
[19:34:37] <oojacoboo> how would I write that if I need to validate an id
[19:34:42] <aro> what do you mean
[19:34:51] <aro> this.id is a javascript scope
[19:34:54] <oojacoboo> if(this.id('yo') == true);
[19:34:59] <aro> no
[19:35:12] <aro> you would want to do $(this).attr('id')
[19:35:31] <oojacoboo> ah
[19:35:43] <aro> otherwise, you could do (i think) : if ( this.id == 'yo' ) { }
[19:35:44] <oojacoboo> this = $(this); common?
[19:36:05] <oojacoboo> yea, that's what I was talking about...
[19:36:08] <aro> $(this) is basically invoking the jquery object on this
[19:36:09] <oojacoboo> didn't mean to close that out
[19:36:28] <oojacoboo> so in this case the delegate element
[19:36:34] <aro> ya
[19:37:35] <aro> how long have you been working with jquery?
[19:37:46] <oojacoboo> like… coding it or looking at it?
[19:38:10] <aro> either :)
[19:38:19] <oojacoboo> looking… years, coding, few weeks
[19:39:11] <aro> cool
[19:39:18] <oojacoboo> not really
[19:39:27] <oojacoboo> I just want to get back to making kick ass UIs
[19:39:38] <kurko_> Hey, something curious happened. In production, a click binding to a anchor is happening twice, but local it's normal. Anyone ever noticed this? (I was using $.live())
[19:40:09] <aro> kurko
[19:40:18] <aro> you might be rebinding an event to an event that is already bound
[19:40:24] <aro> try calling die() before .live()
[19:41:06] <kurko_> aro: I did it. Didn't work. The curious is that it's happening only in production. In my dev machines it doesn't happen.
[19:41:07] <aro> oojacoboo: you a ui guy/girl then?
[19:41:12] <oojacoboo> Aragon: is that not right… http://jsfiddle.net/HX4JD/
[19:41:18] <oojacoboo> UI guy, yes
[19:41:28] <oojacoboo> aro: ^^
[19:41:29] <oojacoboo> :P
[19:41:32] <aro> ha
[19:41:49] <oojacoboo> that fiddle is for you, porfavor
[19:41:56] <aro> i am more of the backend person
[19:42:04] <oojacoboo> need a job?
[19:42:06] <aro> looking
[19:42:07] <aro> always!
[19:42:47] <aro> does preventDefault() get called AFTER the trigger actions or before?
[19:42:50] <aro> or does it not matter?
[19:43:11] <terminal_case> Question regarding jQuery. I'm loading html printed from a PHP script. Why, when I try to load the data (which I assume is the first parameter of the "done" callback), am I getting the string "Read found: " appended on the front?
[19:43:40] <aro> terminal_case: got an example?
[19:43:56] <terminal_case> Hmm... not a public one handy...
[19:44:05] <aro> well that complicates things
[19:44:25] <terminal_case> I get the correct result, I was just curious if perhaps I'm doing the callback wrong, trying to access the html through the wrong callback parameter or something.
[19:44:37] <aro> terminal_case: jsfiddle.net
[19:44:42] <aro> paste your code in there
[19:44:43] <terminal_case> The result is there, it just has that string attached. No pun intended lol.
[19:44:45] <terminal_case> Mmk.
[19:44:46] <aro> so we can see what you are doing
[19:50:56] <terminal_case> Alright, I pasted it, but I don't really understand how the ajax api is supposed to be used.
[19:51:03] <terminal_case> http://jsfiddle.net/gsurr326/rRtAq/5457/
[19:51:35] <terminal_case> I modified my code to make use of the ajax API, but no luck there either lol...
[19:52:38] <aro> ok
[19:52:43] <aro> wtf
[19:52:44] <aro> haha
[19:52:47] <aro> sorry
[19:52:54] <terminal_case> Lol huh?
[19:53:20] <wookiehangover> ? ajax
[19:53:21] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[19:53:22] <aro> did you read the ajax about
[19:53:24] <aro> ? ajax
[19:53:24] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[19:53:30] <terminal_case> Yes, I did.
[19:53:43] <wookiehangover> scroll to the bottom of the page to see the examples
[19:53:55] <terminal_case> However, I don't understand what parameter I should be using in the callback to read the result as html. I did that.
[19:54:29] <aro> use complete
[19:54:31] <aro> erm
[19:54:35] <aro> sorry hit enter too fast
[19:54:36] <wookiehangover> so if the request returns html, it will be passed into the success callback
[19:54:43] <aro> success
[19:54:44] <Eviltwin> I think it might use a textual status
[19:54:52] <terminal_case> Does the "done" callback not work?
[19:54:59] <wookiehangover> no, that works too
[19:55:14] <wookiehangover> but it uses the deferred object issues by the ajax call
[19:55:15] <aro> $.ajax({ data: datastring, success: funciton(data) { } );
[19:55:25] <terminal_case> Alright. And I have named the first parameter "data"
[19:55:27] <bencahill> okay, I gots a problem here...
[19:55:35] <wookiehangover> just take a look at the docs
[19:55:38] <Eviltwin> First of all it would be .done(load_menus_callback_done) not .done(load_menus_callback_done())
[19:55:52] <terminal_case> Eviltwin: I'm using a closure
[19:55:54] <wookiehangover> there are detailed explainations of all of the params, including 'data'
[19:56:00] <wookiehangover> and examples
[19:56:00] <Eviltwin> Oh, my bad
[19:56:05] <Eviltwin> Didn't read
[19:56:05] <bencahill> I need to run something when an <a> is clicked, but it has been previously unbound without a handler...any ideas?
[19:56:06] <terminal_case> No prob :p
[19:56:17] <Eviltwin> Why aren't you just naming it or putting it inline
[19:56:25] <wookiehangover> bencahill: use a delegate event on a parent elem
[19:56:35] <bencahill> wookiehangover: ooh, cool
[19:56:40] * bencahill looks
[19:57:07] <terminal_case> I suppose that would work for this case...
[19:57:50] <terminal_case> I was trying to avoid inline functions though.
[19:58:01] <bencahill> wookiehangover: does that also trigger when I click on the parent, though? (assuming I'm using 'click')
[19:58:18] <terminal_case> And as to normal named ones, I wanted to provide closure capability if needed.
[19:58:30] <wookiehangover> bencahill: no
[19:58:36] <wookiehangover> ? delegate
[19:58:37] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[19:58:47] <terminal_case> See, I'm writing basically an entire site framework, and I'm still at the point of sketching some of these things out.
[19:58:47] <bencahill> wookiehangover: reading the doc page now :)
[19:58:50] <Eviltwin> terminal_case: You're not taking advantage of any closure there
[19:59:09] <bencahill> wookiehangover: I don't understand alot of the terms used...so :-P
[19:59:33] <terminal_case> I know it's not necessary yet... but I felt it may be needed at some point.
[19:59:41] <wookiehangover> so basically
[19:59:56] <wookiehangover> a delegate event is a way to bind an event to an elem
[20:00:10] <wookiehangover> by binding a listener to a parent element
[20:00:44] <bencahill> wookiehangover: gotcha, that makes sense
[20:00:55] <wookiehangover> so in your case, if you're binding and unbinding events on the <a>, it may be useful to use a delegate instead
[20:00:57] * bencahill tests
[20:01:02] <wookiehangover> or you could use namespaced events
[20:01:21] <wookiehangover> $('a').bind('click.wut', function(){ .. })
[20:01:27] <terminal_case> Eviltwin: See, I have the data. This callback works on my site. It returns the html it's supposed to. It just has the string "Read found: " attached to the beginning of the data parameter...
[20:01:54] <wookiehangover> or
[20:01:56] <bencahill> wookiehangover: hmm, doesn't seem to be working
[20:02:11] <bencahill> wait, bad syntax
[20:02:22] <wookiehangover> you could bind 1 event and deal with the logic in the handler
[20:02:38] <wookiehangover> or
[20:02:57] <bencahill> wookiehangover: hrm, still didn't work
[20:02:58] <wookiehangover> you could not capture the click and rely on the hashchange event
[20:03:21] <wookiehangover> my point is that there are tons of ways to deal with event handling without having to bind / unbind things
[20:03:26] <bencahill> wookiehangover: basically, something else has unbound it, and I am left to deal with what's left
[20:03:47] <bencahill> wookiehangover: the href of this is 'javascript:;', so no hashchange
[20:03:47] <wookiehangover> and you have no control of that consequence?
[20:04:16] <wookiehangover> try namespacing the click you want to bind
[20:04:21] <bencahill> wookiehangover: well, I can't change what does that, but I can do other stuff...I'm not sure of what I can do, though
[20:04:22] <wookiehangover> and check your selector
[20:04:29] * bencahill looks up namespacing
[20:04:34] <wookiehangover> ? event
[20:04:36] <bot-t> wookiehangover, Events - These methods are used to register behaviors to take effect when the user interacts with the browser, and to further manipulate those registered behaviors. http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[20:04:51] <wookiehangover> http://api.jquery.com/event.namespace/
[20:06:02] <bencahill> wookiehangover: oh, like instead of binding it to 'click', I'm now binding it to 'whatever'?
[20:06:52] <DrPoole> can i assign a variable in setinterval?  eg: setInterval( "var foobar = checkStatus("+foobar+")", 10000);
[20:06:52] <bencahill> wookiehangover: of course, the example on that page doesn't help me, it uses .click(), which doesn't work in this case
[20:07:48] <DrPoole> ah, got it
[20:07:51] <bencahill> wookiehangover: I tried this: jQuery('.repeater').delegate('#add_field', 'click', function() { alert('yay'); });
[20:07:58] * DrPoole & rtfm
[20:07:58] <DrPoole> :P
[20:08:06] <terminal_case> Meh, I'll figure it out eventually... worst case scenario I have to manually strip the extra characters lol.
[20:08:11] <bencahill> wookiehangover: do you see anything wrong with that?
[20:08:21] <terminal_case> Eviltwin: Thanks for the help.
[20:08:27] <Eviltwin> You're welcome
[20:08:28] <terminal_case> aro: And thank you as well.
[20:08:37] <Eviltwin> Don't really remember what I did
[20:08:41] <aro> np
[20:08:45] <wookiehangover> bencahill: nope
[20:08:49] <terminal_case> Lol, you tried.
[20:09:02] <terminal_case> Which I appreciate.
[20:09:31] <bencahill> wookiehangover: lemme check and see if it does something to .repeater as well...
[20:10:31] <DrPoole> thanks gents.  have a good evening.
[20:12:27] <flint0131> by "block the browser" if ajax async is set to false, does it mean that if I have an ajax request prior to the ajax request with async: false setting it will stop?
[20:12:31] <bencahill> wookiehangover: the plugin is unbinding it like so: $(this).find('a#add_field').unbind("click").click(function(){ blabla
[20:13:21] <bencahill> wookiehangover: ^^ $(this) is .repeater...does that mean I nead to use delegate on something higher up?
[20:25:53] <Eviltwin> If I have <ul><li><a>Foo</a></li></ul> and I do $("body").delegate("a","click",function(){...}); and $("li").click(function(){return false});
[20:26:00] <Eviltwin> The delegate won't fire
[20:26:05] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[20:26:11] <Eviltwin> Seems somewhat illogical to me
[20:35:43] <kborchers> Eviltwin: that makes perfect sense ... though $("body").delegate is silly ... you might as well use live
[20:36:48] <kborchers> ?delegate @ Eviltwin
[20:36:49] <bot-t> Eviltwin, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[20:36:58] <kborchers> look at the additional notes section on that page
[20:52:48] <Aquaguy> Hello guys!
[20:53:25] <Aquaguy> is there any way to stop/sleep the execution until the user submits some value?
[20:53:40] <Aquaguy> I'm doing this, var name = $.prompt('Please enter your name:');
[20:54:12] <Aquaguy> It actually shows a div with that text, a text input and two buttons, Ok and Cancel
[20:54:47] <Aquaguy> I want to assign the value of the input to that variable 'name' once the user has clicked the ok button
[20:54:56] <Aquaguy> just like a regular prompt but made with jquery
[20:56:17] <Aquaguy> is it even possible?
[21:05:12] <intellilogic> I have a menu bar this is loading items into another pane via ajax, I want to add a class to the item that’s active, this is easy enough, but how to remove that class from all other menu items?  http://portfolioonfire.com/next/
[21:12:06] <danieliser> any plugins or methods to detect a color and automatically decide whether the border should be white or black for contrast?
[21:13:09] <intellilogic> $('menu li a .Current_Menu_Item').removeClass('Current_Menu_Item');  That will work, right?
[21:13:23] <intellilogic> ...it's not working, did I type something there or is it somewhere else on my page or script?
[21:13:47] <danieliser> also a way to sort colors by hues?
[21:15:19] <warrenparsons> intellilogic: Did you intend to put a space between "a" and ".Current_Menu_Item"?
[21:16:30] <intellilogic> a with the class of that, no space?
[21:16:47] <warrenparsons> intellilogic: Right.
[21:17:09] <warrenparsons> intellilogic: The way you have it written is as though .Current_Menu_Item is a child of a.
[21:17:17] <intellilogic> oh, I see
[21:17:24] <intellilogic> Still not working right :(
[21:17:33] <intellilogic> $('menu[data-aj] li a.Current_Menu_Item').removeClass('Current_Menu_Item'); $(this).addClass('Current_Menu_Item');    http://portfolioonfire.com/next/
[21:17:47] <intellilogic> adds class correctly, not removing
[21:18:21] <warrenparsons> Do a console.log($(this)); to make sure $(this) is really what you think it is.
[21:18:33] <intellilogic> Oh wait, its working
[21:18:38] <warrenparsons> Nice.
[21:18:38] <intellilogic> this part was working
[21:19:20] <intellilogic> TY :)
[21:19:33] <warrenparsons> Sure thing.

[22:35:06] <JoeToday> i'm having a hard time understanding what e is.  What does it mean when a function gets passed 'e'?  Is that the default?
[22:37:11] <JoeToday> for instance $('selector').click(function(e) { something }); and $('selector').click(function() { something }); is there any difference?
[22:37:39] <warrenparsons> JoeToday:  e is just commonly used to refer to the element in question.
[22:37:53] <JoeToday> So it refers to the selector?
[22:38:11] <JoeToday> warrenparsons: like $(this); or different?
[22:38:11] <coldhead> it's a symbol for the event
[22:38:14] <warrenparsons> Sorry, event.
[22:38:19] <warrenparsons> Not element.
[22:38:20] <coldhead> you can use it to do eventy things
[22:38:22] <warrenparsons> Sleepy.
[22:38:41] <JoeToday> coldhead: ok, and 'click' is the event?
[22:38:52] <coldhead> in your example, yes!
[22:38:53] <JoeToday> so it is passing the function the click event?
[22:39:18] <Axsuul> I want to add methods to an element "live" (after DOM is loaded). Is livequery the preferred solution still nowadays?
[22:40:00] <JoeToday> coldhead: ok, but doens't it do that if I just leave the function arguments blank?
[22:40:05] <Axsuul> you can do
[22:40:07] <Axsuul> e.preventDefault()
[22:40:10] <Axsuul> JoeToday
[22:40:16] <Axsuul> to prevent default click behavior
[22:41:04] <coldhead> ?delegate @ Axsuul
[22:41:04] <bot-t> Axsuul, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[22:41:15] <coldhead> or in jQuery 1.7 on()
[22:41:42] <coldhead> JoeToday: you can mention the e in function (e) {...}
[22:41:50] <coldhead> if you want to use it at some point
[22:41:52] <Axsuul> Sweet thanks
[22:41:55] <coldhead> or you can leave it off
[22:41:58] <coldhead> javascript don't care
[22:42:25] <coldhead> but you might want it to work out mouse position
[22:42:30] <coldhead> or what was actually clicked
[22:42:43] <coldhead> or something like that
[22:48:52] <Axsuul> coldhead: hmm, ok basically im doing $('.slider').slider() but I also want to apply this to any new .slider elements that get created
[22:48:59] <Axsuul> Is this still right for delegate?
[22:49:21] <cypha> coldhead, can you convince me not to get rid of an ajax login?
[22:49:27] <cypha> or is there really no reason?
[22:57:34] <coldhead> Axsuul: slider is a plugin. the way to add it to new elements is to plug it in to them as you add them
[22:57:53] <coldhead> it doesn't happen magically :(
[22:58:07] <Axsuul> i guess one other way to do it is
[22:58:12] <Axsuul> use live on an event
[22:58:14] <Axsuul> that i trigger?
[22:58:36] <coldhead> cypha: can i convince you to get rid of logins all together and just use the honour syste,?
[22:58:55] <coldhead> Axsuul: that's a very beautiful way
[22:59:11] <Axsuul> haha sweet
[22:59:23] <coldhead> $('.newthing').trigger(slideablethingadded')
[22:59:42] <coldhead> and add it there
[22:59:51] <coldhead> in the handler for that custom event
[23:00:36] <cypha> coldhead, I've seen that posted story on that website :)
[23:00:45] <cypha> forget what the site is
[23:03:33] <cypha> coldhead, I currently have an ajax login, but it's requiring a whole lotta work arounds so that other parts of the site respect the login
[23:03:46] <cypha> it's my own site
[23:03:49] <michael_mbp> hi
[23:03:54] <cypha> do you think it's worth it?
[23:04:00] <snover> coldhead: what is a syste,
[23:04:54] <wenbert_> ls
[23:05:00] <michael_mbp> anyone about?
[23:05:16] <coldhead> ?w cyst @ snover
[23:05:18] <bot-t> snover, Cyst - A cyst is a closed sac, having a distinct membrane and division on the nearby tissue. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyst
[23:05:29] <coldhead> you should see a doctor
[23:05:45] <cypha> haha
[23:05:56] <cypha> ?w asdf @ snover
[23:05:58] <bot-t> snover, ASDF - ASDF or asdf may refer to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASDF
[23:06:22] <cypha> ?w psoriasis
[23:06:24] <bot-t> cypha, Psoriasis - Psoriasis () is a autoimmune disease that appears on the skin. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis
[23:06:30] <snover> ?abuse @ cypha
[23:06:30] <bot-t> cypha, Please don't abuse the bot in the channel. If you're testing things, please talk to him in a /query. If you're testing us, think again.
[23:06:49] <wenbert_> tst
[23:07:03] <cypha> ?w spamming @ snover
[23:07:04] <bot-t> snover, Spam (electronic) - Spam is the use of electronic messaging systems (including most broadcast media, digital delivery systems) to send unsolicited bulk messages indiscriminately. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)
[23:07:08] <cypha> damnit
[23:07:20] <coldhead> cypha: why do people need to be logged into your site?
[23:07:34] <cypha> coldhead, to have a history
[23:07:45] <coldhead> tell me more
[23:07:59] <coldhead> can't you let the browser worry about the history?
[23:08:04] <cypha> basically, the same reason a blog would need logins
[23:08:21] <cypha> so posts can be recognized as a particular users
[23:08:47] <coldhead> so you're doing that on the server side
[23:08:57] <cypha> the authentication?
[23:08:57] <coldhead> and you're logging in via ajax
[23:08:58] <cypha> yes
[23:08:58] <michael_mbp> I want to traverse the JSON object tree for this response https://gist.github.com/4f888e54fe498f7fc7ed  - probably use $.each(json_data, function(entryIndex, entry) { ... });  What  I want to know is when I get to the point of doing: if (entry.assets) { $.each(entry.assets, function (index, key){   ..<OVER HERE>...   });    )    }  << how can I do a regexp match for the paths ending in '*_en.mp4" for example?
[23:09:18] <coldhead> and that either succeeds or fails
[23:09:29] <coldhead> where are you having problems?
[23:10:49] <michael_mbp> <OVER HERE> would essentially be like if (key == path that ends in _en.mp4) { update some html} if key == path that ends in _fr.mp4 { ... }
[23:10:52] <michael_mbp> you get the idea
[23:11:03] <coldhead> can you make a demo on jsfiddle michael_mbp ?
[23:11:11] <coldhead> then i will definitely get the idea
[23:11:18] <cypha> coldhead, because I am trying to account for people that don't have js
[23:11:21] <michael_mbp> ok might as well
[23:11:23] <michael_mbp> one sec
[23:11:49] <domino14> can someone please explain to me what 'this' points to
[23:11:53] <cypha> so I have {{if}} statements from my templating language, depending on whether the user is logged in
[23:12:10] <cypha> but the template is rendered server-side
[23:12:30] <cypha> and with the ajax login, I then have to keep figuring out how to show the same info
[23:12:46] <cypha> I almost have to repeat everything twice, once for html login, once for js
[23:13:32] <coldhead> that sounds bad
[23:13:52] <coldhead> what about good old You Are Logged In As Guest
[23:15:16] <cypha> coldhead, what do you mean?
[23:15:42] <cypha> that wouldn't solve the ajax issue?
[23:15:52] <din_> Hello Guys, can any one please tell me how do I create Hash in jquery/javascript
[23:16:18] <michael_mbp> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/ZwY9b/
[23:16:27] <michael_mbp> doesn't really work
[23:18:00] <michael_mbp> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/ZwY9b/1/ so I want to update the variables en_file/fr_file with the paths
[23:18:08] <michael_mbp> that are in the json object assets
[23:18:22] <snover> din_: jQuery cannot help you make drugs.
[23:18:33] <snover> but it can help make you friends with drugs.
[23:18:42] <michael_mbp> lol
[23:18:48] <michael_mbp> meth?
[23:18:53] <michael_mbp> ewww
[23:19:06] <din_> snover: then can Javascript will be helpful in this
[23:19:20] <michael_mbp> i like my teeth\
[23:19:35] <snover> then take meth and you can look at them on your desk every day
[23:19:44] <michael_mbp> no :p
[23:21:41] <coldhead> cypha: what is the ajax problem? i'm still not sure what you mean
[23:21:47] <coldhead> too much meth today
[23:21:53] <cypha> too much?
[23:21:59] <snover> coldhead: wanna come over and take some meth?
[23:22:56] <cypha> coldhead, basically, ajax is causing me to make a messy html file
[23:23:12] <snover> stop templating on the server. :)
[23:23:32] <cypha> snover, then there's no point in having a framework
[23:23:46] <snover> I don’t know what you mean
[23:24:26] <snover> You still need something on the server for doing REST or RPC and usually rolling your own isn’t a particularly good use of time
[23:24:30] <snover> and everything else is on the client
[23:24:33] <michael_mbp> coldhead
[23:24:34] <michael_mbp> help!
[23:24:44] <snover> of course if you are doing that you should probably be using dojo
[23:24:50] <michael_mbp> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/ZwY9b/6/
[23:24:53] <michael_mbp> can we pm?
[23:24:58] <snover> because it already has all the client-side mechanics for it
[23:25:17] <cypha> woooo, michael_mbp wants to pm
[23:25:43] <michael_mbp> wooo
[23:25:50] <cypha> snover, I'm using jquery-tmpl
[23:26:03] <snover> bad idea
[23:26:15] <snover> that code is abandoned
[23:26:36] <cypha> it is???
[23:26:38] <cypha> u sure?
[23:26:47] <snover> read the big letters at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl :)
[23:27:36] <cypha> why the hell do they call it beta then?
[23:27:38] <michael_mbp> anyone http://jsfiddle.net/ZwY9b/7/ ?
[23:28:36] <cypha> snover, my file upload plugin uses jquery-tmpl too
[23:28:43] <snover> sad news for you! :)
[23:31:31] <cypha> it supposedly doesn't depend on it
[23:31:38] <cypha> but I dunno how to work it without
[23:32:19] <cypha> so snover, does jquery-ui already work in templating?
[23:36:51] <cypha> snover, c'mon, what's the low-down?
[23:38:40] <snover> wut?
[23:39:07] <snover> I think jQuery UI is a horrible paradigm and I do not use it so I do not know anything about it
[23:40:24] <cypha> why's it horrible?
[23:40:58] <domino14> is there anyway to write a good jquery plugin without using this everywhere?
[23:41:30] <coldhead> it's hard to use, cypha
[23:42:03] <coldhead> apparently you can do amazing things with it but i am too dim
[23:42:24] <cypha> :)
[23:42:36] <snover> cypha: It is way too DOM-centric and the interface for calling “widget methods” is just…tragic
[23:43:38] <diverdude> I have this in my .js file: $(document).ready(function() {  $('.createbtn').click(createHandler($(this)));  });  What i dont understand is that the createHandler-function is executed when I load the document. Is it really supposed to do that?
[23:43:50] <snover> yes, because you are calling it.
[23:44:02] <diverdude> snover, was that for me?
[23:44:05] <snover> yes.
[23:44:10] <diverdude> but im not calling it
[23:44:21] <snover> what do you think () means after a variable name?
[23:44:21] <diverdude> im saying that on click it should be called
[23:44:48] <diverdude> snover, oh so i should only put the function handler there?
[23:44:59] <diverdude> not the ()
[23:45:02] <cypha> snover, so is dojo an alternative?
[23:45:06] <cypha> or something totally different?
[23:45:45] <diverdude> snover, how do i then tell it to call the function only when the click even occurs?
[23:45:54] <diverdude> snover, and pass this as a parameter
[23:46:05] <snover> ?101 @ diverdude
[23:46:05] <bot-t> diverdude, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[23:46:26] <diverdude> snover, no, could you please just tell me this
[23:46:28] <snover> cypha: Dojo is a completely different toolkit, but you can use jQuery with it if you want (though dojo.query does pretty much everything jQuery does)
[23:46:58] <snover> diverdude: nope! try some stuff yourself, or read, and I am sure you will figure it out in a few minutes and feel much better about yourself than just letting me tell you the answer
[23:47:07] <diverdude> whatever
[23:48:55] <snover> cypha: you can look at some of the tutorials at http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/ if you are interested. in particular, the tutorials about templated widgets might be up your alley.
[23:49:01] <diverdude> anyway documentation only mentions click(function(){}); examples
[23:50:20] <snover> boy, that’s not true at all
[23:50:34] <cypha> snover, then why use dojo over jquery?
[23:50:42] <diverdude> snover, yes it is
[23:51:32] <diverdude> serioously, all examples use anonymous functions
[23:52:10] <diverdude> and my situation does not allow me to use anonymous function
[23:52:34] <diverdude> since i need to have 2 different events on 2 different elements do the same action
[23:52:45] <snover> cypha: jQuery gives you DOM manipulation, Ajax stuff, some basic effects, and that is basically it. Dojo includes an entire widget library, an entire data store library, a build system, classical inheritance mechanism (classes), and…a lot more
[23:53:38] <snover> So, if you are just creating like…a brochure site, jQuery is awesome. But if you are doing stuff that is more complex, Dojo works much better.
[23:54:31] <snover> bitches.
[23:54:39] <snover> you don’t even know why I was going to kick you!
[23:54:40] <coldhead> i kid
[23:54:45] <snover> now you never will
[23:55:00] <snover> and it will slowly eat away at your brain
[23:55:06] <snover> until you go crazy
[23:55:12] <snover> right around commit 200000
[23:55:20] <coldhead> cypha: snover makes an excellent point that if you're building something too rich for jquery you should shop around
[23:55:46] <snover> and when the coroner stops by and shakes his head slowly at the carnage, I can feel proud that I contributed in a small way to your murder rage
[23:55:59] <coldhead> jquery won't mind if you see other libraries
[23:56:28] <coldhead> snover: you just make me EXCITED about 200000
[23:56:37] <coldhead> it's the opposite of murder rage
[23:56:42] <snover> boner rage?
[23:56:51] <coldhead> in a way, yes
[23:56:59] <coldhead> although at my age, bone is too strong a word
[23:57:10] <snover> wet noodle rage?
[23:57:17] <diverdude> it seems that its not possible to pass a parameter to the event handler
[23:57:19] <coldhead> hahaha
[23:57:23] <coldhead> i was going to say faint throb
[23:57:24] <cypha> ok, fine, i'll make the jump
[23:57:27] <coldhead> but noodle is better
[23:57:34] <cypha> does ajax in dojo look the smae?
[23:57:35] <cypha> same
[23:57:38] <cypha> or similar?
[23:57:55] <coldhead> cypha: you're likely snover has taken a shine to you and will help you out
[23:58:01] <coldhead> lucky*
[23:58:21] <snover> yep, not a lot of surprises there
[23:59:04] <snover> there is a tutorial about its ajax stuff
[23:59:38] <snover> has links to other documentation, etc.
