[01:50:42] <themediator> Hey guys, I'm looking for some help with drag&drop. I want to have a set of containers on the right side of the page and the page is just a list of objects. I want people to be able to click & drag objects into containers to be set in order for later submission, but I don't want the object to move at all. Just an opaque copy.
[01:51:22] <themediator> .draggable() seems to move the object itself, and doesn't seem to offer the options I need

[13:56:23] <daemon> sillyslux, yep exactly what I have
[13:56:30] <daemon> var Sports = $("a[data-target='.full-sports-list'].closest('ul')")

[13:56:45] <sillyslux> :)
[13:56:56] <daemon> :)
[14:07:55] <merpnderp> ANyone know why this isn't working? I get a 200, but the html is not returned:   $('#'+domElement).load('http://localhost/StandAloneES/securityContext/securityContext.html');
[14:08:28] <sillyslux> what's domElement?
[14:09:09] <sillyslux> html is not returned? did you look in network panel?
[14:09:12] <merpnderp> sillyslux: a string name for the id to attach that html to
[14:09:25] <merpnderp> sillyslux: yes, it is showing a 200 for the request but no html
[14:09:58] <merpnderp> but if I manually enter that string in a url, the html is there.
[14:10:01] <sillyslux> when you open http://localhost/StandAloneES/securityContext/securityContext.html in a new tab, do you see html then?
[14:10:08] <merpnderp> yes
[14:10:09] <sillyslux> hmm
[14:11:24] <sillyslux> when you look in network panel and get that 200, click on the request and look in "Response"
[14:11:28] <sillyslux> no html there?
[14:11:38] <sillyslux> should be
[14:25:17] <merpnderp> sillyslux: yeah no html :(
[14:29:38] <sillyslux> mhh is that some cors issue then?
[14:33:39] <sillyslux> do you get something like "XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost/StandAloneES/securityContext/securityContext.html. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://my-website.xx' is therefore not allowed access." in the console?
[14:34:58] <sillyslux> i such case i get 200 and no html
[14:38:17] <merpnderp> sillyslux: no, I dont' see a CORS warning
[14:38:43] <merpnderp> I get 200 and 1505 content-length
[14:38:48] <merpnderp> text/html
[14:41:08] <sillyslux> strange
[14:43:08] <sillyslux> and what if you run jQuery.ajax('/StandAloneES/securityContext/securityContext.html').done(html=>console.log(html)) in the console?
[14:43:40] <merpnderp> okay, I'll try that. But the error param in the load callback gives xhr status = 0 and the error message as "error".
[14:43:41] <merpnderp> lol
[14:43:52] <sillyslux> uhh
[14:45:07] <merpnderp> Your JS gives a xhr Object with status = 0
[14:45:17] <merpnderp> and statusText = 'error'
[14:45:39] <merpnderp>  jQuery.ajax('http://localhost/StandAloneES/securityContext/securityContext.html').done(html=>console.log(html))
[14:45:53] <merpnderp> I wonder if IIS won't return html
[14:46:33] <merpnderp> But the request header for jqueryEl.load is text/html
[14:46:41] <merpnderp> so IIS should be fine returning a .html file
[14:49:05] <sillyslux> so, you have iis on localhost?
[14:50:41] <sillyslux> is that something you can just enable (or install) on win10 or do you need some MSserver for that?
[14:51:23] <merpnderp> sillyslux: I think I just went into Win10's addons (forgot what it's called) and enabled it which installed it.
[14:51:30] <merpnderp> But I've got a ton of crap running on it.
[14:51:57] <sillyslux> yeah i've just google it
[14:52:54] <sillyslux> a one click webserver. nice.
[14:54:10] <sillyslux> bored... if i had windows, i might just play with it tonight...
[14:54:52] <merpnderp> I'm not happy with it. Maybe if I took advantage of everything it can do, but 95% of the time it just gets in the.
[14:55:18] <merpnderp> And don't ask me why, but my NTLM module does auth in about 70% of the time IIS does.
[14:56:53] <sillyslux> hm
[14:59:05] <sillyslux> if you wonder if it might be an iis issue, are there any logs? i mean there are.. did you look into?
[14:59:26] <merpnderp> I never have luck looking into IIS logs. Never tell me anything useful
[15:00:09] <merpnderp> if I curl it from the CLI I get the html :/
[15:00:12] <sillyslux> well if it says something like T!!ERROR!! somewhere...
[15:00:40] <sillyslux> strange though...
[15:05:34] <merpnderp> Yeah very strange. Request header of text/html shoudl have no problem returning html :/
[15:24:25] <merpnderp> sillyslux: lol it was CORS
[15:24:37] <merpnderp> for giggles I enabled cors in the web.config and now it works. Thanks :)
[15:25:29] <SomeT> I have implemented: http://www.jquery-steps.com/GettingStarted#basic into: http://hastebin.com/recucewepi.html anyone know why it don't work? I don't get any errors in the console
[15:28:56] <sillyslux> SomeT, move lines 45-47 below line 56
[15:31:26] <SomeT> ok
[15:32:00] <SomeT> it does something different now
[15:32:03] <SomeT> but its not perfect, lol
[15:32:20] <sillyslux> :)
[15:32:39] * SomeT cries
[15:40:35] <SomeT> do I need to style the css or something?
[15:40:47] <SomeT> the site does not tell me what css I need
[15:41:44] <sillyslux> looks like style is up to you
[15:42:16] <rindolf> Hi all.
[15:42:33] <SomeT> but is that why I am getting no buttons and such?
[15:42:39] <SomeT> I mean there are no errors in the console
[15:44:10] <rindolf> SomeT: where?
[15:44:25] <sillyslux> don't know what you are getting, haven't tried your code
[15:44:52] <sillyslux> i think jquery-steps.com is using twbs or something similar to do the style
[15:49:06] <hamdjan> hi how do i select the value of data-test: <div class="test" data-test="123">       i tried:   $('.test').click(function () {  $(this).data('test'); });
[15:52:16] <SomeT> what do you mean where?
[15:53:15] <sillyslux> hamdjan, works for me
[15:53:44] <hamdjan> thanks for assuring. i think it doesn't work for me because my $this is wrong
[15:53:50] <hamdjan> maybe because callback fiddle
[15:57:30] <hamdjan> how do i make sure that i get the $this that i want? http://dpaste.com/0A72TDX
[16:02:28] <sillyslux> what's logged in line 25? undefined?
[16:02:33] <sillyslux> or what?
[16:02:38] <hamdjan> yes it was undefinied
[16:03:00] <hamdjan> but nvm, it works now. my issue was that i had thought $(this) selects the tooltipster parent tag
[16:03:11] <sillyslux> try debugger there, and examine while it's paused
[16:03:19] <hamdjan> so i had to add the data-restorepoint actually to the element that got clicked
[16:04:18] <sillyslux> in line 10 you could write just functionReady: restoreaction
[16:04:53] <hamdjan> i had data-restorepoint only within the anchor tag but not in the actual tag in title which gets tooltipstered as a tooltip http://dpaste.com/1W6W6VF
[16:05:10] <hamdjan> ah thanks, I'll do that
