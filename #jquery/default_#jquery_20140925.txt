[00:01:40] <noaXess> i wanted to use the handle, to enable selecting text insdie the draggable element...
[00:01:43] <noaXess> hm..
[00:02:43] <noaXess> PATSCH.. it's .disableSelection()
[00:02:44] <noaXess> LOL
[00:03:19] <Cork> something you call?
[00:03:46] <noaXess> yes ;) it's from the examples... so remove it and it works.. handle and selecting text inside elements..
[00:04:12] <Cork> nice
[00:20:13] <SubCreative> Having some issues with a .click() event in a loop.
[00:20:15] <SubCreative> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CPlF-IEkXQ
[00:20:18] <SubCreative> http://jsfiddle.net/ntd01bxb/2/
[00:20:20] <SubCreative> Oops :D
[00:20:44] <SubCreative> Can anyone take a look and help to explain what I might be doing wrong here?
[00:21:00] <Cork> SubCreative: use delegated event handlers instead of adding event handlers in a loopå
[00:21:03] <Cork> *loop
[00:23:07] <SubCreative> Cork: each click event is tied to an ID
[00:23:16] <SubCreative> that is unique
[00:23:52] <SubCreative> I'm not familiar with using delegated event handlers (im reading the jquery docs), so I'm a little unsure how to approach.
[00:24:37] <SubCreative> With delegate it looks like you apply the click to a specific element like P or a class.
[00:24:44] <Cork> SubCreative: not sure why that would matter http://jsfiddle.net/ntd01bxb/3/
[00:25:07] <SubCreative> Ill review
[00:25:08] <SubCreative> thanks
[00:25:31] <SubCreative> derp
[00:25:35] <SubCreative> that makes much more sense.
[00:25:36] <SubCreative> Thanks
[00:26:13] <SubCreative> Adding the event handler to the table and selecting the button was much smarter :D
[00:31:45] <matt_s3d> morning all
[00:31:58] <mooncup> is there an easy way to check if a text area has summernote bound to it?
[00:32:12] <Cork> summernote?
[00:32:18] <Cork> is that a plugin or something?
[00:32:30] <mooncup> yeah tis similar to ckeditor
[00:32:38] <Kartagis> wee
[00:32:40] <SubCreative> Its a WYSIWYG text editor for bootstrap it looks like.
[00:32:42] <SubCreative> http://hackerwins.github.io/summernote/
[00:32:52] <mooncup> but ckeditor binds to a variable, so I can just check if that's truthy
[00:32:59] <Cork> mooncup: wysiwyg editors don't use textarea
[00:33:08] <matt_s3d> I have some form elements, which are array based.  e.g. form1-unit_amount[] and form1-quantity[] and the form1-total[]    Is there a way of running some js which will update the total[] (for that row) (there are obviously multiple rows)
[00:33:09] <Cork> they always hide the textarea in one way or another
[00:33:12] <Cork> just look for that
[00:33:13] <Kartagis> draggable is fun once you don't forget to replace .selector with your class name
[00:33:16] <mooncup> ahh
[00:33:20] <mooncup> so if textarea is visible?
[00:33:27] <mooncup> then I can assume the editor isn't in use
[00:33:31] <mooncup> that's clever
[00:33:42] <Cork> ya, but a cleaner way would be to check ex for a class
[00:33:57] <Cork> just inspect it and see what classes are there
[00:34:06] <mooncup> hm good should
[00:34:08] <mooncup> shout
[00:34:16] <mooncup> I'll bind an editor and see what it does to the html
[00:34:19] <mooncup> cheers
[00:35:25] <Kartagis> Cork: what must we do if we also want the drag image to appear?
[00:35:50] <Cork> Kartagis: think it was called helper or ghost
[00:38:32] <Chif> hello, I'm having troubles with a jquery sum of cells, I keep getting 0's, anyone can help me?
[00:38:42] <Cork> ?paste
[00:38:43] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:39:11] <Chif> moment please
[00:43:36] <matt_s3d> Ok, another issue / attempt.  I have a form with many rows, all of them as the same.  I wanted to update the total field - and thus thought this would work  -  but does notâ€¦ $('.totalchange').closest('.qtotal').val(555);
[00:43:48] <matt_s3d> any ideas?
[00:43:56] <Cork> ?paste
[00:43:56] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:44:39] <matt_s3d> the form structure is like this
[00:44:40] <matt_s3d> http://pastebin.com/X2enDHyP
[00:44:56] <matt_s3d> (its in blade but easy to read)
[00:45:11] <Cork> ...
[00:45:13] <Cork> ?paste
[00:45:13] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:45:31] <Cork> make a demo of the problem
[00:45:39] <Cork> with the html and the needed js
[00:45:52] <matt_s3d> Cork: ok
[00:46:59] <matt_s3d> http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/
[00:47:03] <matt_s3d> Cork: : http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/
[00:47:52] <fRAiLtY-> is reloading the DOM equivalent to just a simple page refresh
[00:48:32] <matt_s3d> Cork: slight update: http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/1/
[00:49:15] <Cork> matt_s3d: closest doesn't do what you seam to think it does
[00:49:27] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com closest
[00:49:28] <b-ot> Cork: .closest() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:49:30] <matt_s3d> Cork: clearly :P  any suggestions?
[00:49:55] <Cork> matt_s3d: you need to traverse the dom so you can access the target your looking for
[00:50:10] <matt_s3d> how would I do that, sorry im not great at js
[00:51:14] <Chif> http://jsfiddle.net/9s200dnd/1/ that's part of it,
[00:51:18] <Cork> something like $(this).closest('.col').nextAll('.col').first().find('.qtotal')
[00:51:35] <Chif> I need the "minutes" on the cell
[00:51:57] <matt_s3d> thanks cork, ill see what i can muster up
[00:52:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/2/
[00:52:39] <matt_s3d> Cork: awesome
[00:52:41] <matt_s3d> Thanks
[00:52:54] <Cork> but you should read up on closest
[00:53:00] <matt_s3d> I guess I use the same technique to pick up the value of the other field (quanity or unit)
[00:53:12] <matt_s3d> ill look at clostest now
[00:53:16] <matt_s3d> closest
[00:53:30] <Cork> matt_s3d: ya, but you need to understand what i changed, why and why your code didn't work
[00:53:40] <afsdf> I did a google search and I cant seem to find setTimeout being used in this way... but if I remove the code it breaks the script. How would I use setTimeout( 'act.play_ajax(' + post_id + ')' , 200 ); without setTimeout?
[00:54:17] <Cork> matt_s3d: are you adding a separate fieldset for each group?
[00:54:32] <Cork> cause then the selector could be simpler
[00:54:38] <matt_s3d> yes, ill get a bigger example of htmlâ€¦..
[00:54:48] <Cork> simply $(this).closest('fieldset').find('.qtotal').val()
[00:55:02] <Cork> and it would work for all the fields in there
[00:55:16] <matt_s3d> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/3/
[00:55:31] <Cork> ok then ya
[00:55:36] <Cork> use $(this).closest('fieldset').find('.qtotal').val()
[00:56:14] <matt_s3d> Cork: sorry there isnt a feildset for row, but is one per repeated overall form â€˜group'
[00:56:27] <matt_s3d> but i can easily add in a div with a class for each row
[00:56:39] <Cork> ah
[00:56:50] <Cork> matt_s3d: well you can go either way
[00:56:55] <Cork> it would make traversing simpler
[00:57:02] <Cork> but you can do without if you prefer
[00:57:20] <matt_s3d> i prefer simplicity, ill add in
[01:01:04] <Chif> could anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/9s200dnd/1/
[01:01:31] <matt_s3d> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/4/
[01:01:46] <Cork> Chif: please ask the question in the channel
[01:02:10] <Cork> matt_s3d: typ
[01:02:30] <matt_s3d> typ?
[01:02:30] <Chif> I'm having troubles with a jquery sum of cells, I keep getting 0's, anyone can help me? http://jsfiddle.net/9s200dnd/1/
[01:02:37] <Cork> opps
[01:02:38] <Cork> *yup
[01:03:01] <Cork> matt_s3d: now all you need is to understand the examples i've given you
[01:03:11] <matt_s3d> yeah ill go through it all now
[01:03:11] <Cork> Chif: ah, right
[01:04:24] <dan2k3k4> in $.ajax error: function(jq) {} -> I get jq.responseText but it's a string of the page (<!DOCTYPE etc.) -> I want to parse that html string to get just the content of 1 ID
[01:05:02] <Cork> Chif: you need to remove the text from the lastTime before trying to parse it
[01:05:46] <Chif> Cork: but I need to have the text shown on my cell, I've tried without it and I'm getting the same error
[01:07:10] <Cork> also you just want the 7 minute not the 2 minute td?
[01:07:24] <Cork> (you currently only select one of them)
[01:08:29] <Chif> I need to add up both, this fields are populated from a DB, so the fields are generated automatically and with the same class as is a php loop, but I've not been able to add em up
[01:08:52] <Kartagis> I'm getting Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token +=
[01:09:42] <Kartagis> oh, omitting var fixed it
[01:09:53] <Cork> Chif: your html is broken
[01:10:17] <Cork> Chif: http://jsfiddle.net/9s200dnd/2/
[01:10:29] <Cork> quite a bit of changes, all of it is needed
[01:10:34] <Cork> note the fixed html
[01:11:25] <Chif> kk let me try
[01:12:39] <Kartagis> Cork: why do you replace digits with null?
[01:12:49] <Cork> Kartagis: sorry?
[01:13:04] <Kartagis> sum += parseInt(lateTime.replace(/[^0-9]/g, ''), 10);
[01:13:09] <Cork> i don't
[01:13:10] <Kartagis> oh
[01:13:17] <Kartagis> ! = not
[01:13:25] <Kartagis> ^ = negate
[01:13:27] <Cork> i replace none digits with ''
[01:13:31] <Kartagis> right
[01:17:06] <Chif> Cork: if the class of the object has another class it doesn't affect it right?
[01:17:11] <matt_s3d> Cork: Im nearly there, the code works for the first row, but wont work on additional rows - any advice
[01:17:12] <matt_s3d> http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/5/
[01:17:47] <Cork> Chif: you can add as many extra classes as you want as long as those two is still there
[01:18:30] <Cork> matt_s3d: you still haven't learned to use .closest i see
[01:19:31] <Chif> Cork: ok
[01:20:42] <litropy> I love this chan.
[01:22:49] <Cork> matt_s3d: http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/6/http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/6/6/
[01:22:55] <Cork> matt_s3d: always have a base in parseInt
[01:23:16] <Cork> matt_s3d: and you are missing the qquantity and qunit classes on the none first rows
[01:23:53] <mooncup> Cork: that's quite some url
[01:23:59] <Cork> opps
[01:24:10] <Cork> stupid clipboard...
[01:24:11] <matt_s3d> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/5ep79f6y/6/6/ - that only works on the first one
[01:24:29] <Cork> yes
[01:24:33] <Cork> cause the classes are missing
[01:24:34] <Cork> like i said
[01:24:53] <Cork> you need to add the missing classes on the fields
[01:24:56] <matt_s3d> oh yeah
[01:26:50] <matt_s3d> ah , perfect, thanks!! I get what closest does now (e.g. only goes up)
[01:27:08] <Cork> it starts at the current element
[01:27:18] <Cork> and checks if it or any of its parents matches the selector
[01:27:37] <Cork> and gives you the first one in the chain (starting at the current element) that matches
[01:32:16] <fRAiLtY-> Shouldn't this > $('.gallery').load($(location).attr('href') .gallery); < reload the current page and replace .gallery with itself from the reloaded instance?
[01:32:40] <Cork> you missing the string you want to concat
[01:32:44] <Cork> and no it won't replace it self
[01:32:53] <Cork> it will load it self inside it self
[01:33:09] <fRAiLtY-> So to simply reload a div I have to ajax request
[01:33:09] <Cork> <elm class="gallery><elm class="gallery></elm></elm>
[01:33:21] <Cork> it doesn't reload
[01:33:30] <Cork> it loads it from an ajax call to the server
[01:33:36] <Cork> (or the cache)
[01:34:04] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: but it is a hack for users that can't fix there servers
[01:34:30] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the solution you should basically always try to implement is to have partials server side
[01:34:38] <Cork> and load them with ajax instead (without the selector)
[01:36:40] <fRAiLtY-> Hm ok
[01:36:48] <Chif> Cork: I've found something else, I though that other "td" wouldn't affect, I've updated the html http://jsfiddle.net/9s200dnd/2/
[01:37:04] <Chif> they're making my function fail
[01:37:33] <Cork> i don't see any failure here
[01:37:57] <Chif> hmmm
[01:38:04] <Chif> I saw my mistake
[01:38:10] <Chif> but on my whole code is not working
[01:47:21] <Chif> nvm I found the problem elsewhere
[01:47:47] <Chif> just a last question, how do I make the result unique for each row?
[01:47:55] <Chif> in case I have more rows
[01:48:04] <Cork> don't use $('.sum')
[01:48:12] <Cork> and use it in the outer .each loop
[01:48:33] <litropy> I'm reading up on .closest() and their last example, it looks like they store a div into a var and set the color of the text at the same time? var listElements = $( "li" ).css( "color", "blue" );
[01:48:33] <Chif> okey, thanks
[01:48:39] <litropy> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:48:55] <Cork> Chif: http://jsfiddle.net/9s200dnd/3/
[01:49:16] <Cork> litropy: yup
[01:49:55] <litropy> Cork, well that's pretty darned interesting.
[01:50:03] <Cork> what is?
[01:50:50] <Chif> thanks a lot, it's working now!
[01:51:15] <litropy> Cork, storing an element into a var and operating upon the element in the same statement.
[01:51:30] <Cork> litropy: it isn't really the same statement
[01:51:41] <Cork> $() will find the element
[01:51:50] <Cork> it will return a jquery object with the element
[01:52:10] <Cork> all jqeury function except a few (ex. attr) returns the jquery object passed to it
[01:52:28] <Cork> so var a = $('something').css('color', 'red');
[01:52:31] <litropy> Cork, I've always thought of it as var myvar = Everything here is for storage only!
[01:52:40] <Cork> is the exact same thing asvar a = $('something'); a.css('color', 'red');
[01:53:14] <Cork> litropy: the reason you can chain is cause they return the original jquery object
[01:58:57] <litropy> Cork, what's more efficient resource-wise: if ($(this).attr("id") === 'myid') or if ($(this).is("myid") ?
[01:59:25] <Cork> the later won't work :)
[01:59:32] <Cork> and the first one is
[01:59:36] <litropy> Ah.
[02:00:04] <Cork> also f ($(this).attr("id") === 'myid') might just as well be if (this.id === 'myid')
[02:00:23] <Cork> litropy: if ($(this).is("#myid")) is an option if you prefer
[02:00:30] <Cork> but ya it is quite a bit heavier
[02:00:41] <litropy> Oh that's right - I forgot the hash.
[02:02:46] <litropy> Cork, Hm. So jQuery just does if (this.id === 'myid') when all is parsed and processed?
[02:03:00] <litropy> Cork, that's standard javascript, right?
[02:03:08] <Cork> litropy: not at all
[02:03:26] <Cork> $(this).id(selector) makes a document.querySelectorAll
[02:03:36] <Cork> and then checks if this is in the list of returned elements
[02:03:38] <fRAiLtY-> Sorry another quicky, my ajax request returns html from my updated page, but doesn't actually "update" the page, do I need to add something in the success to make it update the page. I can see in Firebug the returned HTML is new, just it doesn't update the screen
[02:03:50] <Cork> litropy: that is why .is is much heavier then .id
[02:04:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: well yes you do, how else is it suppose to know what you want to do
[02:04:43] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: if you just want to load it into an element use .load
[02:05:13] <fRAiLtY-> Cork That's fair comment, I thought it was the case just not worked much with it
[02:05:55] <fRAiLtY-> so I can do $(document).load() in the success to effectively re-render the whole page
[02:06:07] <Cork> O_o
[02:06:18] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you don't replace the entire page with ajax
[02:06:42] <fRAiLtY-> Cork The ajax request returns a whole page
[02:06:44] <Cork> if you want to load a full pace replacement use window.location = new_url
[02:07:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: then that is most likely the problem
[02:07:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: if you can't fix the server, you would have to hack around it by trying to select out the content you want from the retur blob
[02:08:38] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Sorry perhaps I'm making it sound more awkward than it is. http://pastie.org/9593074# is my function (3rd party script). I'm showing my overlay div by removing the class ('hidden') then after doing so I simply just want to refresh the entire page content behind it, once done hide the div (addClass).
[02:08:59] <fRAiLtY-> There's numerous elements on the page being updated so a whole page refresh seems easier
[02:09:05] <litropy> Cork, I think I'm confused about which case you were talking about. (this.id === 'myid') seems like standard javascript because it's not $(this).id
[02:09:09] <fRAiLtY-> w2p_updateCurrent($val); does thsi
[02:09:17] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: then do window.location.reload()
[02:09:33] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ajax isn't meant to be used to replace things outside the body tag
[02:09:41] <fRAiLtY-> Cork instead of the ajax or in the success part of the ajax
[02:09:47] <Cork> read meant to as == can't
[02:10:49] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you could try to do something nasty like $('body').html($(msg).find('*'))
[02:11:04] <Cork> but ya, the problem is the response from the server isn't what you need
[02:11:46] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: note though that won't "refresh" the page
[02:11:55] <Cork> it will just replace all the elements inside body
[02:12:09] <Cork> and might break things cause ready and onload events won't fire (as the page isn't reloading)
[02:12:29] <fRAiLtY-> Cork So it would be better to return the actual element(s) being updated by this process rather than the whole page
[02:12:30] <Cork> the only option to do a full reload is to do window.location.reload()
[02:12:38] <Cork> or window.location = window.location;
[02:12:44] <softplay> Hello, just a brief advice: if i have a click event on a link and after it i restore the link in the page (adding some html content outside it) then why is the click event not working any more after the first click? (I'm building the code in jsfiddle but it's many lines and it will take a while)..
[02:12:46] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: yes
[02:13:02] <litropy> fRAiLtY-, that's what ajax is all about
[02:13:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: that is the point of ajax
[02:13:39] <litropy> fRAiLtY-, ajax enables you to do only what's needed.
[02:15:13] <litropy> softplay, how do you restore the link?
[02:15:22] <litropy> Cork, I think I'm confused about which case you were talking about. (this.id === 'myid') seems like standard javascript because it's not $(this).id
[02:15:24] <Cork> restore what link?
[02:15:37] <Cork> litropy: exactly
[02:15:50] <Cork> litropy: $(this).prop('id') === this.id
[02:15:57] <Cork> so why the extra wrappers
[02:16:07] <softplay> litropy, with a string appended to the parent element
[02:16:50] <Cork> softplay: sounds like you add the event handler to the element
[02:16:58] <Cork> softplay: when you load the new html you replace the element
[02:17:06] <Cork> and there by loses all the event handlers
[02:17:26] <Cork> softplay: an option is to delegate the event handler to a parent you don't replace
[02:17:31] <Cork> softplay: or bind the event handler again
[02:17:32] <litropy> Cork, I see. And just to wrap it up, that's lighter than .is()?
[02:17:35] <softplay> so i should restore it differently.. right
[02:17:38] <softplay> thanks
[02:17:44] <Cork> litropy: your kidding right?
[02:17:58] <Cork> one checks a variables value
[02:18:10] <Cork> and one traverses the dom and then loops the result looking for a match
[02:18:44] <litropy> Cork, Haha okay. this.id it is, then.
[02:19:06] <Cork> litropy: $(this).attr('id') is the same thing as this.getAttribute('id')
[02:19:19] <Cork> litropy: $(this).prop('id') is the same thing as this.id
[02:19:33] <Cork> the left one has a tiny overhead of the jquery wrapper
[02:19:37] <Cork> but normally doesn't matter
[02:19:51] <marrrk_> Hello! Is there some visual tool to create animations?
[02:19:57] <Cork> but as you just want this.id, why have the extra characters ($().prop(''))
[02:20:24] <Cork> marrrk_: there exist web tools for creating css animations
[02:20:28] <litropy> Cork, I see. Thanks for taking the time to explain.
[02:20:30] <Cork> so i'm sure there are some for jquery
[02:46:30] <sprihodko> Hi. Sorry for noob question. But if i have function $('input').on 'change' and console.log $(this) it will show me current changed input. And when it is like this $(document.body).on 'change', $('input') console.log $(this) will print me document.body. How can i get current changed input from here?
[02:51:44] <Cork> sprihodko: sounds like you want to delegate the change event
[02:52:00] <Cork> but there is never a reason to delegate to $(document.body)
[02:52:17] <Cork> $(document).on('change', 'input', function() { $(this) })
[02:52:38] <Cork> if you have to delegate it as far up as to body, just delegate it to document
[02:53:06] <sprihodko> cork: can i delegate it to unchanged element right?
[02:53:16] <Cork> uh, what?
[02:53:48] <Cork> an unchanged event makes no sense
[02:54:02] <Cork> it would fire all the time except when a user change something
[02:54:05] <sprihodko> Cork: $('.static-div').on('change', 'input', function() { $(this) })
[02:54:23] <Cork> that listens for the change event ya
[02:56:27] <sprihodko> Cork: thanks! it is better now but $(this) gives me $('.static-div') and not changed input
[02:59:10] <Omar-> arschmitz hi
[03:01:24] <CocoStorm> Hi, I'm getting a readyQ is undefined error in the cnosole. Why is this?
[03:03:14] <Cork> readyQ?
[03:03:21] <Cork> is the Q a typo?
[03:07:42] <AllTuna> Hey
[03:08:27] <AllTuna> How can I detect clicks on a div added using .html()?
[03:09:23] <Omar-> AllTuna delegate event $("static_container").on("click", "dynamic_elm", function () { /* code */ });
[03:09:28] <Ankeet> hello
[03:09:34] <Omar-> wrap that in .ready of course
[03:09:35] <Omar-> hi
[03:10:47] <Ankeet> Hi Ben Alman, I just started my career with Front End Development, and I'm already your fan! Thanks for sharing such awesome posts!
[03:11:36] <mooncup> 11:09 < Omar-> wrap that in .ready of course
[03:11:42] <mooncup> I'm never sure how necessary that is any more
[03:11:50] <mooncup> I forget to do that constantly and it never seems to make a difference
[03:12:06] <mooncup> I guess as long as your js is after your html it makes no difference?
[03:13:01] <Omar-> mooncup let me set a fiddle for you
[03:13:02] <Cork> mooncup: you shouldn't have you js in the body
[03:13:14] <Cork> mooncup: except as the absolutely last element in the body
[03:13:29] <Cork> mooncup: but if you have it in head, you need ready
[03:13:55] <mooncup> Cork: tis kinda hard with our "framework"
[03:14:05] <mooncup> our site is powered by some hacked version of opencart
[03:14:10] <Cork> mooncup: cms systems often makes that hard ya
[03:14:18] <Cork> still doens't mean it is good to do so
[03:14:26] <mooncup> yeah I don't doubt it's not best practice
[03:14:37] <mooncup> but if I need to pass data from php into js how else do I do it?
[03:14:55] <Cork> by setting data in data- attributes for example
[03:15:00] <Cork> js should NEVER be inline in the html
[03:15:04] <mooncup> yeah I suppose
[03:15:28] <Cork> csp block that sucker!
[03:15:28] <mooncup> tis hard with partials etc though
[03:15:35] <Cork> no it isn't
[03:15:48] <mooncup> if you have a partial page that has some js then how do you only include that js in the parent when you need it?
[03:16:00] <Cork> mooncup: you don't
[03:16:15] <Cork> you include it, but build the script in a way it won't act unless it is needed
[03:16:29] <mooncup> but then the client ends up downloading a fuckload of js they don't need
[03:16:41] <Cork> once ya
[03:16:46] <Cork> and then it stays in there cache
[03:16:47] <Omar-> mooncup http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/cxmue5ue/
[03:16:55] <Cork> so every page load after that loades exactly zero js
[03:16:59] <mooncup> I guess
[03:17:19] <Cork> compared to loading a shitload of js on every page load
[03:17:27] <Cork> cause it differs slightly/ is inlined
[03:17:37] <mooncup> yeah that makes sense tbf
[03:17:44] <mooncup> we're starting from scratch in january
[03:17:53] <mooncup> so it's something I can build in from the start then
[03:18:06] <mooncup> Omar-: interesting
[03:18:06] <Cork> mooncup: i can actually recommend looking at csp
[03:18:15] <xec> tbf?
[03:18:22] <Cork> To Be Fare
[03:18:30] <mooncup> what does csp stand for?
[03:18:34] <mooncup> google is very unhelpful
[03:18:34] <Cork> it gives you some restrictions that helps you write cleaner AND safer code
[03:18:37] <Cork> ?g mdn csp
[03:18:39] <b-ot> Cork: CSP (Content Security Policy) - Web security | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP
[03:18:50] <mooncup> unless you mean the chartered society of physiotherapy
[03:19:06] <mooncup> ah
[03:19:22] <Cork> enable that, forebid inline js
[03:19:23] <mooncup> I'm guesisng based on the first paragraph that you can send out a header that stops any inline js being executed?
[03:19:29] <Cork> you prob want to allow inline css
[03:19:36] <Cork> (jquery basically dies without it)
[03:19:46] <Cork> and then allow just a few paths to load js
[03:19:49] <mooncup> that looks really good
[03:19:57] <Cork> and you have a nice and controlled environment
[03:19:59] <mooncup> though we've stopped xss anyway I think
[03:20:10] <Cork> mooncup: sure, you SHOULD
[03:20:12] <mooncup> all our post and get have html tags stripped out unless explicitly allowed
[03:20:23] <Cork> this is an extra layer, should never be the only
[03:20:28] <mooncup> yeah
[03:20:44] <mooncup> when we build the new system I'm definately going to push for this though
[03:20:57] <Cork> and i use it to force to think in a certen pattern (where eval is not an option)
[03:21:01] <Cork> or inline js
[03:21:23] <AllTuna> Omar-, I'm wrapping this in a doument.ready, but it oesnt seem to be wrking.
[03:21:39] <Cork> mooncup: be prepared that it will feel like it breaks everything for you at the beginning :)
[03:21:40] <Omar-> AllTuna http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/cxmue5ue/
[03:21:44] <Cork> mooncup: it for sure did for me
[03:22:08] <Cork> mooncup: but when you've gotten into the right way of thinking about problems cause of it
[03:22:18] <Cork> you can't understand how you could ever do it any other way :D
[03:22:19] <Omar-> AllTuna, $(document).ready(function () { /* code */ });
[03:23:54] <mooncup> yeah Cork tis certainly a massive change
[03:24:06] <mooncup> our current system is way to big to switch over
[03:24:11] <mooncup> but it looks like it solves a lot of issues
[03:24:21] <mooncup> so I'll definately look into it in january
[03:24:30] <Cork> ya, you can't really switch over a system that is written inline js
[03:24:36] <Cork> it is too big a job
[03:24:50] <Cork> mooncup: btw, when your at it you most likely want to go "use strict"; too
[03:25:01] <Cork> helps with undefined variables and what not
[03:25:05] <mooncup> yeah
[03:25:12] <mooncup> I already code as if it's switched on
[03:25:18] <mooncup> but it would be nice to actually turn it on
[03:25:21] <Cork> well sure, i did too
[03:25:32] <Cork> but it is actually way to easy to make a mistake there
[03:25:49] <Cork> and by accident create a global variable
[03:25:59] <Cork> only parser errors can really plug that one
[03:26:10] <Cork> (well jslint is an option)
[03:26:41] <mooncup> yeah true
[03:27:06] <mooncup> also I dunno how good the other devs are at defining variables etc
[03:27:12] <mooncup> it would be a good way to see :D
[03:27:21] <mandark_> Hey guys.. I'm having a problem that's driving me nuts
[03:27:21] <Cork> ya
[03:27:29] <mandark_> hopefully somebody here can help
[03:27:31] <mandark_> http://jsfiddle.net/gpmhazjk/#fork
[03:27:50] <Cork> mandark_: not before you ask the question
[03:29:17] <mandark_> so.. im targeting a parent selector in an on function, but when inside of the mouse enter listener, $(this) keeps returning the first object of the parent container
[03:29:52] <mandark_> how can i get the real this, instead of the that this
[03:29:54] <mandark_> :D
[03:30:14] <AllTuna> Omar-, is there any reason why this wouldnt work http://jsfiddle.net/x53185tz/
[03:30:16] <Omar-> mandark_ I guess you need to replace .position() with .offset()
[03:30:45] <FrEaKmAn_> hi all.. do you recommend a image gallery library which also supports rotating images?
[03:31:22] <Omar-> AllTuna please update your fiddle with relevant code to your issue :)
[03:31:23] <Cork> mandark_: this inside the events will be the .hover-area element you hover
[03:32:00] <Cork> mandark_: opps sorry missed the selector at the end
[03:32:42] <Cork> mandark_: http://jsfiddle.net/gpmhazjk/1/
[03:32:56] <Cork> mandark_: if you check the console you will see it targets the expected .area
[03:33:55] <mandark_> Cork: it appears you are corrent
[03:33:57] <mandark_> Cork: it appears you are correct
[03:33:58] <AllTuna> Omar-, the only thing thats missing is adding the dynamic divs]
[03:34:04] <AllTuna> they get added correctly
[03:34:18] <AllTuna> and they all have the class "suggestion"
[03:34:52] <Omar-> AllTuna I can see nothing but <label id="autocorrect"></label>
[03:35:01] <mandark_> Cork: why would the .find('.container').position().top; not be targetting the inner div?
[03:35:18] <Cork> mandark_: what makes you think it doesn't?
[03:36:10] <Cork> mandark_: http://jsfiddle.net/gpmhazjk/2/
[03:37:36] <AllTuna> Omar-, http://jsfiddle.net/x53185tz/1/

[03:40:20] <litropy> I'm trying to prevent default to all links except those with class 'no-ajax'. Does my method seem kosher? http://jsfiddle.net/Lwj6w06q/
[03:43:04] <mandark_> Cork: it was my buggy css!!  http://jsfiddle.net/akL5L24c/
[03:43:05] <Omar-> litropy if (!$(this).hasClass('no-ajax')) { "!" next to "$(this)"
[03:43:20] <effortDee> can i swap .live through to .on without any real problems?
[03:43:29] <litropy> Omar-, thx. Otherwise it's good?
[03:43:31] <effortDee> deprecated in jquery 1.9 that i've just upgraded too
[03:43:35] <Cork> effortDee: yes, and no
[03:43:36] <effortDee> and its the only problem im seeing
[03:43:51] <effortDee> im looking at the live documentation on jquery.com and it looks very very similar
[03:43:53] <Cork> effortDee: .on uses the syntax from delegate
[03:43:57] <effortDee> ok
[03:44:12] <Cork> effortDee: live doesn't have a syntax
[03:44:20] <Cork> it was removed cause it was a bad idea
[03:44:27] <effortDee> yes i read about htat
[03:44:28] <effortDee> and its problems
[03:44:29] <effortDee> ok
[03:44:31] <Omar-> litropy should be good, try it :)
[03:44:37] <effortDee> i'll just five right in and see what happens
[03:44:39] <effortDee> thanks Cork!
[03:44:45] <Cork> effortDee: $(document).on('event', 'target') == $('target').live('event')
[03:44:55] <Cork> so you need to translate a bit
[03:45:09] <Cork> effortDee: you might also want to bind to a closer static parent instead of document
[03:45:22] <effortDee> mmm
[03:47:52] <Omar-> litropy http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/Lwj6w06q/2/
[03:49:53] <litropy> thx Omar-
[03:51:21] <Omar-> np :)

[04:36:01] <jellevdvliet> that expands automatically with jquery autosize plugin
[04:36:06] <jellevdvliet> but what I want is, that when you type, it expands upwards
[04:36:12] <jellevdvliet> right now my cursor in my textarea is at the bottom of my screen
[04:36:16] <jellevdvliet> and I want it to stay in the middle
[04:39:57] <Morthez> mdunbavan1985: city.school_name

[05:03:48] <guest13421> Hi. How can we check wheterh we have one or more than one checkboxes checked in each row of table? If more than one then throw error.
[05:08:15] <jugglinmike> guest13421: You can run `$('tr input[type="checkbox"]:checked').length > 1`. Really though, it sounds like you should be using a radio input
[05:08:57] <jugglinmike> http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[05:10:16] <guest13421> jugglinmike: not a bad option :)
[05:35:37] <mrcloud> hello. In this jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/awtfjkdg/ what can I do to animate height of the windows when the button is displayed? (you have to type a name to show the  button)
[05:40:37] <Cork> mrcloud: set a fix height of the window and animate to the new height before you show the buggon
[05:40:40] <Cork> *button
[05:41:02] <AdamPDotty> manipulate windows height ?
[05:41:27] <mrcloud> Cork: but I don't know the new height. As you can see the window is resized automatically. I want to animate that
[05:41:29] <AdamPDotty> Can I enlarge my screen, too?
[05:41:57] <Cork> mrcloud: but you can't do that
[05:42:00] <Cork> that was the point
[05:42:11] <mrcloud> Cork: oh, I see
[05:42:16] <Cork> mrcloud: what you can do is grab the field heights before the animation
[05:42:18] <Cork> show the button
[05:42:19] <decx> it's a chat so you resize to viewport size or not
[05:42:23] <Cork> grab the new height
[05:42:27] <Cork> then hide the button again
[05:42:32] <Cork> and animate it to the new height
[05:42:41] <mrcloud> Cork: ok, Ill do that. Thanks
[05:42:45] <Cork> and after the animation reset the height to dynamic
[05:47:05] <didiergm> jquerymobile: themeroller indicates v1.4.3 and library is at 1.4.4 ill there be an update of themeRoller or is 1.4.3 fine for 1.4.4 ?
[05:52:09] <dANO> Hi it's possible to simplify this : if number == 1 || number == 2 ||number == 3 ...etc ?
[06:00:02] <decx> use a switch
[06:00:03] <Biwaa> dANO: if number > 1 && number < x
[06:00:17] <dANO> decx: yes i use switch thank's man
[06:01:39] <Biwaa> decx: well i didn't understand the same as you :D i though it was a  single test
[06:01:46] <decx> it is
[06:01:57] <decx> oh
[06:01:58] <decx> right
[06:02:00] <Biwaa> so switch will not result the same
[06:02:04] <Biwaa> :s
[06:02:08] <Biwaa> or i'm dump xD
[06:06:22] <jiffe> anyone know a good component for displaying messages?  Maybe something simiar to a gmail thread
[06:21:01] <Shebbi> can you redirect in ajax callback function?
[06:25:05] <BillCriswell> Shadda: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/503093/how-can-i-make-a-redirect-page-in-jquery-javascript
[06:26:15] <Shebbi> lets chat about it
[06:27:29] <Shebbi> that does the redirect on client side
[06:28:50] <Cork> Shebbi: yes you can redirect an ajax call
[06:28:58] <Cork> Shebbi: js won't know about the redirect though
[06:29:12] <Cork> the browser resolves the redirect before the response is returned to js
[06:29:48] <Shebbi> but when you do the redirect it loads the page in a jquery dialog as thats what im using
[06:31:12] <Cork> Shebbi: ah, you mean redirecting the page?
[06:31:21] <Cork> no you can't redirect the page from an ajax call
[06:31:31] <Cork> or rather reload the page from an ajax call
[06:31:37] <Shebbi> th ajax request request is sent from a dialog
[06:31:38] <Cork> (server side)
[06:31:42] <Cork> no
[06:31:58] <Cork> ajax isn't connected to any element
[06:32:11] <Shebbi> the redirect is done on server side
[06:32:26] <Cork> yes, and that redirects the ajax call
[06:32:32] <Cork> it doesn't trigger a reload of the page
[06:33:04] <Shebbi> but the redirect page gets displayed in the dialog. i dont want that
[06:33:20] <Cork> Shebbi: something is taking the response from the ajax call
[06:33:28] <Cork> and puts that in "the dialog"
[06:33:57] <Cork> you would have to notice that the data is something you don't want to show and don't display it
[06:34:16] <Cork> Shebbi: though if you don't want to show the redirect you are most likley better of not redirecting server side for ajax calls
[06:34:33] <Cork> just test for the xhr header
[06:35:23] <Shebbi> my current solution is to do the redirect on sucess in client side :(
[06:35:56] <Shebbi> xhr header?
[06:36:59] <Cork> Shebbi: X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
[06:37:22] <Cork> if you see that header server side, just send something like "ok" back
[06:37:27] <Cork> and handle that client side
[06:40:32] <Shebbi> but the server must run a validate function on ajax request first and if true then redirect. still possible ?

[07:16:00] <Ghiuyh> hey guys
[07:16:10] <Ghiuyh> I'mgetting this -- 09 is not a legal ECMA-262 octal constant
[07:16:15] <Ghiuyh> why?
[07:17:44] <systemfault> Because octal = base 8..
[07:17:58] <systemfault> That's like asking why 11210000 is not valid in binary
[07:18:20] <systemfault> Or why FG isn't a valid hexadecimal number
[07:18:55] <systemfault> Ghiuyh: Unless your question is "Why is 09 treated as octal by JS?"
[07:19:17] <systemfault> Because when a number is prefixed by 0, it's an octal number.
[07:21:55] <Ghiuyh> systemfault : mmm
[07:22:13] <Ghiuyh> I understand you , but I have no idea why will be happening this
[07:22:19] <hlfw0rd> How can I get the length of a ul that has list items added to it after page load?
[07:22:28] <hlfw0rd> Since I cannot use .live anymore :/
[07:22:47] <systemfault> Ghiuyh: Just paste your code on a pastebin website like jsfiddle.net
[07:22:59] <systemfault> hlfw0rd: .on has 2 different syntaxes
[07:23:17] <decx> read this http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[07:23:40] <Ghiuyh>  I guess is for this : <td onclick='manageM029(".$row['idvisa'].", 009)'><span class='ui-icon ui-icon-pencil'></td>
[07:23:46] <hlfw0rd> systemfault, But don't they both require an event?
[07:24:00] <systemfault> hlfw0rd: Read decx's link :)
[07:24:28] <hlfw0rd> Ouu
[07:24:31] <systemfault> Ghiuyh: When a number is prefixed by a 0, it's a number in octal (base 8)
[07:24:42] <systemfault> Ghiuyh: basically 009 is not the same as 9
[07:30:17] <xnotte> i have a button on the center of the page and when i click it it shows the UI dialog, but it always aligns the bottom of the dialog to the bottom of the visible window. Anyway i can see the top of dialog in the middle of the page, and the bottom of the dialog overflowing the visible window ? i've tried positioning top 50% but no success http://jsfiddle.net/ax4sasLe/1/
[07:33:52] <Insayne> hello, I have a live search at the moment that uses PHP/MYSQL, and i wanted the "enter" key to go to the first listed result, is there a simple method to do so?
[07:37:22] <BillCriswell> Insayne: Look at the keypress event and if it's enter find the first match and trigger a click.
[07:38:39] <hlfw0rd> It still does not give the live coutn
[07:39:13] <hlfw0rd> In fact, inside the .on callback, it gives me 1 >< $("#tweets").length
[07:43:45] <mrcloud_> hello. If I have a div with a fixed height where I add content dinamically, how can I move the scrollbar of that div to the bottom every time I add something?  I tried with $("#messages").animate({ scrollTop: $("#messages").height() }, "slow"); but as the height doesn't change this doesn't work
[07:43:46] <shoky> hlfw0rd: .on requires an event yes. but so did .live
[07:46:38] <shoky> mrcloud_ you can try  $('#messages').prop('scrollHeight')
[07:48:22] <mrcloud_> shoky: just that? I tried but doesn't do anything
[07:48:46] <shoky> mrcloud_  instead of $('#messages').height()
[07:49:51] <mrcloud_> shoky: perfect, its working! Thanks
[07:50:07] <shoky> yey
[08:01:29] <hlfw0rd> Is there a complete callback I can use along with .on hover? So I can execute something when the user is no longer hovering?
[08:02:17] <kevireilly> hlfw0rd: $('el').hover(function in(){}, function out(){});
[08:23:39] <gnarf> hlfw0rd: ^^^^ that maps to mouseenter / mouseleave
[08:24:03] <gnarf> so you can .on('mouseenter', enter).on('mouseleave', leave) too
[08:28:54] <nonconvergent> I have an <a> tag serving as a boostrap button that does a thing, and I want to slip a on("click", function(){}) into it before that link is resolved. Maybe you guys know a better way to do the tag?
[08:30:39] <brandonw> if i have a <select> tag that i empty(), then repopulate, and then call change() immediately afterwards, the handler does not see the <select> as having a selected option yet. if i put a breakpoint in there, it works (the delay caused by pausing execution somehow gives the client enough time to finish doing whatever it is doing and select the default first item of the new list of options)
[08:31:01] <brandonw> is there a way to hold the script until the option is ready, or something like that? or am i dogni something incorrectly here?
[08:31:51] <brandonw> oh wait. i think i just realized what is wrong.
[08:32:34] <jellevdvliet> Hi guys
[08:34:00] <brandonw> ah yes. i was calling $.getJSON with a callback given to .done, so at the time of calling $(select).change(), the elements had not been populated yet.
[09:00:46] <arduinoo1> Is there an easy way in jQuery to take a url e.g., http://www.domain.com?foo=bar&biz=bat and send it as a POST request where the query string is sent as form data?
[09:01:04] <arduinoo1> Or at the very least, parse the query string into an array
[09:02:21] <robertmaxrees> arduinoo1 you mean in an ajax POST?  or just a normal post?
[09:02:30] <Respek> afternoon all :)
[09:03:10] <Vorspire> (arduinoo1): hmm, doesn't jQuery.ajax() support query segments of URI's in the 'data' option/param?
[09:03:37] <Vorspire> could be wrong, been w hile since i've had to do it
[09:04:43] <DelphiWorld> 'lo all
[09:04:55] * DelphiWorld need a jquery rss news ticker plugin, anyone?
[09:06:14] <Respek> survynna: why did you just send me a link? don't PM me please
[09:06:20] <jemendja> hello
[09:06:25] <DelphiWorld> op's
[09:06:33] <DelphiWorld> BillCriswell:  survynna  is spaming people
[09:06:41] <DelphiWorld> Respek: not only you
[09:06:46] <Respek> DelphiWorld: can confirm
[09:06:52] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: ^^
[09:07:04] <DelphiWorld> time for kick
[09:07:31] <benzhninja> sup legends
[09:07:38] <benzhninja> does jquery work on the surface pro 3
[09:08:33] <TheFakeazneD525> jscary
[09:08:47] <TheFakeazneD525> Quick question, why is it called jquery tho
[09:08:55] <TheFakeazneD525> sounds like something more related to SQL
[09:09:36] <robertmaxrees> what's going on?
[09:09:46] <DelphiWorld> robban: survynna  was spaming
[09:09:51] <DelphiWorld> but it out
[09:09:53] <robertmaxrees> they were already k-lined
[09:10:03] <DelphiWorld> :P
[09:10:19] <BillCriswell> Sounds like a new fragrance from Calvin Klein.
[09:11:22] <DelphiWorld> can someone recomand a news ticker plugin for rss?
[09:11:26] <robertmaxrees> TheFakeazneD525 he was going to call it JSelect but the domains were all taken.  Settled on jQuery as a result.
[09:11:29] <benzhninja> anyone?
[09:11:34] <TheFakeazneD525> robertmaxrees: ah
[09:11:37] <TheFakeazneD525> ty
[09:11:43] <robertmaxrees> benzhninja which browser?
[09:12:08] <robertmaxrees> benzhninja becauyse jquery focuses on support browsers, not devices.
[09:12:11] <benzhninja> IE11 touch version
[09:12:28] <robertmaxrees> all versions of IE11 are touch-enabled :)
[09:12:34] <robertmaxrees> even if you don't have a touchscreen.
[09:12:38] <robertmaxrees> but yes, jquery works for that.
[09:12:42] <benzhninja> ok
[09:12:49] <benzhninja> thanks
[09:13:42] <Ghiuyh> guys
[09:13:48] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell ^ :D
[09:14:00] <BillCriswell> Unicorn?
[09:14:10] <robertmaxrees> guys
[09:14:11] <Ghiuyh> if I have 3 numerics digits, but I want like 6.14 for example . how can I get it?
[09:14:17] <BillCriswell> guys
[09:14:26] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Ghiuyh
[09:14:27] <b-ot> Ghiuyh: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:14:56] <Ghiuyh> this no need code
[09:14:58] <Ghiuyh> is just that
[09:15:11] <Ghiuyh> 6.14 instead 614
[09:15:12] <BillCriswell> I need to see what number you're starting with.
[09:15:23] <BillCriswell> Ghiuyh: What have you tried?
[09:15:25] <robertmaxrees> Ghiuyh does it need to be a number or a string?
[09:15:38] <Ghiuyh> is a number into a string
[09:15:54] <Vorspire> really? divide by 100
[09:16:12] <decx> lol
[09:16:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, depending on the "rules" surrounding what you want, dividing the number by 100 is probably your sanest bet.
[09:16:32] <BillCriswell> ( 614 / 100 ) + ""; if you need it to be a string.
[09:16:45] <Vorspire> divide it by a float to preserve accuracy
[09:16:46] <Vorspire> 100.0
[09:16:56] <Vorspire> not that it matters much lol
[09:16:59] <robertmaxrees> or use toString() on it.
[09:17:01] <BillCriswell> I'm having deja-vu
[09:17:26] <decx> last time something like that came up the answer was divide by 10 BillCriswell
[09:17:35] <Ghiuyh> ok+
[09:18:09] <BillCriswell> Never got an ok+ before. That feels a lot more positive.
[09:18:36] <Ghiuyh> I don't know why reason I didn't thought before
[09:18:56] <robertmaxrees> it's like you don't want to be weird and be all "great!", but you want something more than just "ok"
[09:19:00] <Ghiuyh> yes. is very positive because is what I need
[09:19:10] <Ghiuyh> ok
[09:19:12] <Ghiuyh> +
[09:19:22] <Vorspire> most common ebay feedbak: A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ xD
[09:19:33] <BillCriswell> decx: Makes sense.
[09:26:57] <roysegall> Hi, i need help with query autocomplete - i have a restful service that return elements that are already in the input. How can i prevent this?
[09:28:48] <djoanes> $(document).load(function() { console.log('foo'); }); -- never renders, how should i debug
[09:29:18] <robertmaxrees> djinni any errors in the console?
[09:29:21] <robertmaxrees> err, djoanes
[09:30:15] <robertmaxrees> djoanes also, check to make sure you actually have jquery loaded, the page is valid, etc.
[09:30:28] <djoanes> robertmaxrees: jquery is definitely loaded
[09:30:39] <robertmaxrees> djoanes any errors in the console?
[09:30:55] <djoanes> robertmaxrees: nada
[09:31:17] <robertmaxrees> and the script is actually loaded on the page?
[09:31:34] <Respek> question, does anyone have a preferred scroll spy plugin? I just need to add the hover effect to my nav when in particular areas of the page
[09:31:48] <benzhninja> djoanes: because that doesnt make sense
[09:31:57] <benzhninja> $(document).load is not a function
[09:32:15] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/ :)
[09:32:19] <benzhninja> you sould write: $(function(){ console.log("foo"); });
[09:32:24] <benzhninja> then it will work
[09:32:28] <robertmaxrees> good catch though, use a document ready instead.
[09:32:49] <benzhninja> always use the shorthand though
[09:32:51] <robertmaxrees> you could also use $(window).load(), though that's likely not what you want.
[09:32:57] <robertmaxrees> the shorthand is the same thing.
[09:33:05] <benzhninja> $(function(){ }); vs $(document).ready(function(){});
[09:33:09] <benzhninja> the first one is quicker to type
[09:33:17] <robertmaxrees> and functionally identical :)
[09:33:34] <benzhninja> ok
[09:33:42] <robertmaxrees> you can also do $().ready(function() {});
[09:33:44] <benzhninja> I remember when I used jQuery
[09:34:27] <robertmaxrees> but those are not the same as $(document).on('ready', function() {});
[09:34:49] <benzhninja> yeah
[09:35:09] <benzhninja> also you should never bind user interactions such as .click() to an object
[09:35:23] <benzhninja> always bind it to the document with argument1 being the object
[09:35:24] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[09:35:47] <benzhninja> e.g. $(document).on("click","#foo", function(){}); vs $("#foo").on("click", function(){});
[09:35:52] <decx> no
[09:35:52] <benzhninja> always use the first one
[09:35:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:35:56] <robertmaxrees> not always.
[09:35:58] <decx> you overload the document with that
[09:36:05] <robertmaxrees> no need to always delegate.
[09:36:10] <decx> all these events have to travel all the wayto the doc
[09:36:19] <robertmaxrees> and you're filtering on literally every click even if you don't need to.  lots of overhead you can avoid.
[09:36:35] <robertmaxrees> bind as far down as you can.
[09:36:39] <benzhninja> ok
[09:37:17] <robertmaxrees> delegated listeners are good times though.  they can solve a lot of headaches.
[09:37:58] <benzhninja> they are nessecarry if you call the function before the element is created on the page
[09:38:08] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:38:23] <robertmaxrees> or you bind later, after the element has been created.
[09:38:28] <decx> still you dont want to bind to doc
[09:38:35] <decx> always the closest static parent
[09:38:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah 100%
[09:38:45] <benzhninja> ok
[09:39:03] <decx> i remember when live() was killed and in a panic i just replaced all the live binds with doc on ^^
[09:39:11] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[09:39:16] <robertmaxrees> that's basically what it did anyway.
[09:39:21] <decx> ye
[09:39:26] <robertmaxrees> gross though.
[09:39:39] <jimi_> Can someone help me take a look at this .on() event, it seems to fire no matter where i click/tap http://pastie.org/private/ldyzhnosztdmwuysyz5bba
[09:39:54] <robertmaxrees> jimi_ your second argument is wrong.
[09:40:03] <robertmaxrees> you want just the selector, not the object.
[09:40:19] <jimi_> oh
[09:40:19] <jimi_> ha
[09:40:22] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on(touchClickEventName, '#procedure-header', function() {
[09:40:27] <robertmaxrees> also, bind further down than document.
[09:40:36] <decx> just read the last 30 lines
[09:40:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:40:53] <jimi_> well... that puts a new paint job on things :P
[09:41:08] <robertmaxrees> Respek so could you clarify what your question earlier meant?
[09:41:37] <Respek> oh sure
[09:44:40] <Respek> well, on hover, my nav menu items have a little arrow on them (cute!)
[09:44:54] <Respek> I'd like to have that hover effect trigger when the person in on that part of the page
[09:45:33] <Respek> from my initial research, it seems that this is called scroll spy. but I wanted to ask around in here about implementation first
[09:48:32] <GT_> hello, I'm having troubles displaying a text on a "td" using conditions, could somebody help me?  http://jsfiddle.net/2g0a1rh8/
[09:49:47] <roysegall> Hi, i need help with query autocomplete - i have a restful service that return elements that are already in the input. How can i prevent this?
[09:50:14] <DelphiWorld> robban sory dude ;(
[09:50:24] <DelphiWorld> always bad autocomplete to robertmaxrees
[09:54:06] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: sorry for the delay, yes in a $.post()
[09:54:12] <robertmaxrees> roysegall do a full replace instead of an append?
[09:54:23] <robertmaxrees> Respek there's a plugin called scrollspy you could use.
[09:54:30] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld it's all good :D
[09:54:39] <roysegall> robertmaxrees, what do you mean?
[09:54:54] <robertmaxrees> roysegall could you share your code to show us what you're doing now?
[09:55:01] <robertmaxrees> it's fine if the example doesn't function.
[09:55:14] <roysegall> robertmaxrees, yes
[09:55:17] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: basically I want to script some delete requests in a page, they have a url with http://something.com?foo=bar&biz=bat but the query string is actually supposed to be form data and it's supposed to be POSTed to the server
[09:55:31] <DelphiWorld> :D
[09:55:51] <Respek> robertmaxrees: that's aligned with what I found as well. ok thanks
[09:55:55] <GT_> hello, I'm having troubles displaying a text on a "td" using conditions, could somebody help me?  http://jsfiddle.net/2g0a1rh8/
[09:55:56] <roysegall> robertmaxrees, https://gist.github.com/RoySegall/54b714cbec1a7a87b715
[09:56:17] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: so I basically want to parse the URL into http://something.com and {foo: "bar", biz: "bat"} so I can construct a $.post() request
[09:56:33] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you want to use ajax to post some JSON
[09:56:38] <roysegall> robertmaxrees, i tried any thing. Remove this from the backend, check if it's still in the input. Nothing
[09:56:41] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: yes
[09:56:56] <robertmaxrees> arduinoo1 you'd have to transform the params yourself to do that.
[09:57:00] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple though.
[09:57:22] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: yeah, I think it's fine to jsut .split() but it would be nice to have a url parsing functionality in jquery
[09:57:58] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: so I don't have to split the url by "?" then split everything in the query string by "&" then split all the tokens by "=" and build an array
[09:58:19] <robertmaxrees> arduinoo1 what's funny is there's stuff to go from an object to a string, but not the other way around.
[09:58:30] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: obviously I can do that---I have the technology---but I was wondering if jquery did this already
[09:58:38] <robertmaxrees> arduinoo1 not that I'm aware of.
[09:58:41] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: yeah, that's what I was thinking
[09:59:10] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: then again I'm sure that this particular use case doesn't come up quite as often
[09:59:31] <robertmaxrees> arduinoo1 i think part of it is it's hard to know exactly what format people are expecting for that kind of serialization.  that'd be a good plugin to write.
[09:59:48] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: well, there are options out there like URL.js
[10:00:13] <robertmaxrees> arduinoo1 sure.  you could also use http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[10:00:21] <robertmaxrees> which is a personal favorite of mine.
[10:00:42] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: yeah im just wondering why there are so many implementations that jquery never bothered to merge it. seems to me like there's a reason not to.
[10:00:58] <robertmaxrees> arduinoo1 right - like I said, it's hard to know what the expectations are about format.
[10:01:42] <arduinoo1> robertmaxrees: and jquery doesn't have a "something is better than absolutely nothing" approach... or a beta namespace
[10:02:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:02:45] <robertmaxrees> roysegall i'm not terribly familiar with autocomplete, but something tells me you need to remove the old results explicitly before putting the new ones in maybe?
[10:03:44] <GT_> hello, I'm having troubles displaying a text on a "td" using conditions, could somebody help me?  http://jsfiddle.net/2g0a1rh8/
[10:04:04] <robertmaxrees> GT_ lateT = parseInt(lateTime.replace(/[^0-9]/g, ''), 10) won't work since lateTime is a jquery object.
[10:04:19] <robertmaxrees> you want lateT = parseInt(lateTime.text().replace(/[^0-9]/g, ''), 10)
[10:05:49] <robertmaxrees> also, your $(this).find('.res') will never works since .res isn't a child of $(this) - it's a sibling.
[10:06:21] <GT_> even if I'm calling rowTotal before?
[10:07:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?  you're in $('.lateTime').each(function () { - that means your $(this) is the current .lateTime td
[10:07:40] <GT_> you're right, I was thinking of another code I had different
[10:08:33] <GT_> thank you, it's working now
[10:08:45] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[10:08:59] <GT_> one nooby question lol
[10:09:04] <roysegall> robertmaxrees, didn't fully understood you
[10:09:08] <robertmaxrees> that's what we're here for :)
[10:09:14] <GT_> how do you send a message directed to somebody here?
[10:09:30] <robertmaxrees> GT_ usually by just prepending their username to your message
[10:09:38] <Uhkis> /msg nick message
[10:10:00] <Uhkis> that would be a private message
[10:10:04] <Respek> I usually do the first few letters, tab, then the message if it's not direct
[10:10:05] <GT_> okey
[10:10:07] <GT_> lol
[10:10:08] <GT_> thanks
[10:10:09] <robertmaxrees> if you mean private message someone, Uhkis has it, though we generally ask that people don't do that.
[10:10:27] <GT_> so just prepend
[10:10:28] <GT_> thanks
[10:10:41] <guest13421> can we get sum of radio buttons in column?
[10:10:43] <Uhkis> we do?
[10:10:45] <robertmaxrees> roysegall maybe I'm not fully understanding the question.  you said something about duplicate results?
[10:10:47] <roysegall> robertmaxrees, Never mind. I found the problem. i had the tags variable that was going with var tags = value.split(","); The problem is that i didn't trim the value.
[10:10:52] <guest13421> All radio buttons in column have diffrent name
[10:10:59] <robertmaxrees> roysegall aaaaah there you go.
[10:11:23] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis yeah, PMing people is a bit of a no-no unless you ask ahead of time.
[10:11:27] <roysegall> robertmaxrees, yeah. something was strange there. I used underscore js to trim the array easily.
[10:11:30] <robertmaxrees> that's my deal at least.
[10:11:39] <roysegall> robertmaxrees, but thank you any way.
[10:11:49] <robertmaxrees> roysegall sure!  sometimes we just need a rubber duck :)
[10:12:03] <roysegall> spit, gum and a hall lot of duck tape
[10:15:19] <robban> DelphiWorld: No prob :)
[10:15:34] <DelphiWorld> robban: :) :) ;)
[10:23:47] <Respek> can you do addclass like this (with two classes?): $("nav li:last-child a").addClass("et-show-dropdown et-hover");
[10:24:12] <robertmaxrees> the docs tell you :) http://api.jquery.com/addclass/
[10:24:39] <Respek> thanks for the fishing lesson :) your're a good dude
[10:24:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:24:56] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com <- totally fantastic resource imo
[10:25:29] <Uhkis> we even have this:

[10:50:27] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:50:49] <Getty> hm? :) are you one? :)
[10:50:58] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you're asking.
[10:51:21] <Getty> jquery.shapeshift is a library
[10:51:33] <Getty> and i seek other people who use it as it has no commuity beside its github issues and i try to gather it
[10:51:34] <robertmaxrees> right - are you looking for help?
[10:52:01] <Getty> exchange of experiences, i dont have specific problems, but specific wishes and someone with  more experience might can give hints how doable it is or not
[10:52:18] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Getty
[10:52:18] <b-ot> Getty: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:52:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:52:22] <Getty> before i myself go into the code
[10:52:26] <Getty> dude, i know how to ask questions
[10:52:29] <Getty> if i have one i ask it
[10:52:35] <robertmaxrees> just sayin' :)
[10:52:38] <Getty> and i asked exactly what i wanna know, i seek other people who uses it
[10:52:39] <Getty> yeah thanks
[10:52:45] <Getty> i was here when we had 50 people
[10:52:52] <Getty> please....
[10:53:29] <robertmaxrees> no need to be defensive - i'm just pointing out that there's no reason to ask if people use something, y'know?  we might be able to help/provide some input either way :)
[10:53:47] <Getty> nah i dont think you could do what i could do: dig into the code
[10:53:53] <Getty> and i would not want others to dive into the code
[10:54:01] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:54:02] <Getty> but i can seek ...... people who might have already
[10:54:16] <Getty> cause the project has 1200< stars on github
[10:54:26] <Getty> might be a clear sign that there must be a bigger amount of people using it (and its seriously awesome)
[10:55:11] <robertmaxrees> okay
[10:56:47] <Jagst3r21> any idea how to get jQuery cycle to adapt on screen resize? I have fit set to true, but it does not work as expected
[11:11:43] <Jagst3r21> anyone?
[11:11:59] <Mokstar> Bueller?
[11:12:27] <hlvwrk> Bueller?
[11:12:29] <hlvwrk> *cough*
[11:12:44] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r21 can you show us what you're currently doing in a fiddle or something similar?
[11:12:51] <hlvwrk> ^^^^
[11:13:23] <Jagst3r21> can I pm you a link to show you the behavior I am seeing?
[11:14:04] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather you sent it to the channel instead.
[11:14:19] <robertmaxrees> since I might not be able to help, but somebody else could.
[11:14:31] <Jagst3r21> alright
[11:14:35] <Jagst3r21> if you go here http://dev.semgeeks.com:8888/semgeeks2/
[11:14:48] <Jagst3r21> you will see a carousel slider that I am trying to make responsive
[11:15:12] <robertmaxrees> okay. so what's the issue?
[11:15:30] <Jagst3r21> I cannot figure out how to make this jQuery cycle responsive
[11:15:57] <Jagst3r21> I know there is a cycle 2 plugin, but I am using Drupal and there are no modules available with cycle 2 yet
[11:16:02] <robertmaxrees> media queries and/or bind to the resize event to reinit when you get to a certain size.
[11:16:20] <robertmaxrees> does jquery cycle have some kind of built-in responsive deal?
[11:16:42] <Jagst3r21> I have tried this: http://hastebin.com/qihojatini.coffee
[11:16:53] <Uhkis> Jagst3r21: doing a views slideshow?
[11:16:58] <Jagst3r21> yeap
[11:17:10] <Uhkis> Jagst3r21: go flexslider
[11:17:25] <Jagst3r21> I could not get flexslider to work
[11:17:41] <Jagst3r21> troubleshooted for an hour and it was simply not working the way I wanted
[11:18:01] <robertmaxrees> sounds like cycle doesn't work either.  there are some responsive carousels out there if that's what you need.
[11:18:05] <robertmaxrees> bxSlider is one of them iirc.
[11:18:23] <Jagst3r21> well it kind of works
[11:18:33] <Jagst3r21> I applied "fit: 1"
[11:18:43] <Jagst3r21> and that works, but when it changes slides it does not carry over..
[11:18:54] <Jagst3r21> and the height of the container does not resize either
[11:19:49] <robertmaxrees> there are some ideas here, too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7003290/making-a-jquery-cycle-plugin-become-responsive-to-the-layout-pixels
[11:26:45] <Jagst3r21> robertmaxrees so in that example I would replace .cycle with #views_slideshow_cycle_div_new_portfolio_faders-block_1 ?
[11:27:01] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r21 i have no idea - just pointing you in a direction.
[11:27:03] <robertmaxrees> probably?
[11:27:15] <washeul> have any one ever use googlemap api distance matrix
[11:27:43] <washeul> how to get the distance between 3 point
[11:29:34] <Jagst3r21> hmm doesnt seem to work
[11:37:10] <decx> washeul no idea about google maps but the easiest way mathematically is: centerx = point1.x + point2.x + point3.x / 3, centery = point1.y + point2.y + point3.y / 3
[11:57:28] <washeul> decx actually  i do not have any ideaabout it do you have any reflink how to do it
[11:57:47] <washeul> how to implement the code
[12:01:22] <decx> sorry my comment was facetious, i doubt googles distance api uses straight lines ^^
[12:32:34] <Prometheian> I'm using CSS3Pie to get some CSS3 functionality in IE7/8. My local system looks/works fine with it, however in our testing server it doesn't seem to be working at all. I'm fairly certain it's serving the htc file correctly but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas. :s

[13:28:37] <ljdevs_> This is giving a undefined error in the focusout part, as well as messes up the layout
[13:28:50] <ljdevs_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f50f204b1dab7fef86ac
[13:28:53] <ljdevs_> what am I doign wrong?
[13:29:49] <robertmaxrees> $thisParent.removeClass('form-group-hover'); - that var doesn't exist outside of focusIn
[13:30:10] <robertmaxrees> you need to get it again.
[13:35:53] <ljdevs_> How would I pass $this?
[13:36:02] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[13:36:11] <robertmaxrees> two separate event handlers.
[13:36:39] <robertmaxrees> unless you declared a variable in a parent scope and used it in there, but imo that's a little funky.
[13:36:49] <naomi> robertmaxrees +1
[13:37:07] <robertmaxrees> be explicit with your functions.
[13:37:13] <robertmaxrees> keep them modular and stuff.
[13:38:50] <grez> Hello everyone. I was wondering if a knowledgable someone would be able to help me out with a very simple question. If anyone has time could they take a look for me? https://gist.github.com/bcGiR/3922a92f3484ce5382f7 Thanks.
[13:39:35] <naomi> ljdevs_ https://gist.github.com/naomik/30cff2297d66e9a872ee see, it's a little funky
[13:39:51] <naomi> this code is horrible for other reasons though
[13:39:57] <naomi> way to much tethering happening
[13:40:08] <naomi> tethering, coupling, whatever
[13:40:16] <robertmaxrees> grez because your binds are happening before the ajax finishes.
[13:41:00] <naomi> robertmaxrees +1
[13:42:01] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.  x finishes.

[13:42:04] <robertmaxrees> dammit
[13:42:08] <robertmaxrees> fixee.org/paste/hfsfzmj/
[13:42:09] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[13:42:50] <ljdevs_> Thanks guys
[13:42:54] <naomi> you could also pass a callback to .load that wouldn't be called until the ajax response is returned
[13:43:10] <robertmaxrees> sure, but that's just going to rerun logic you don't need - use delegation and be done :)
[13:43:13] <grez> Thanks robertmaxrees, but could you explain a little more for me. I just don't quite understand what binds are, and what's happening before it finishes.
[13:43:32] <robertmaxrees> grez so .load() is an ajax convenience method.
[13:43:47] <grez> yes
[13:43:50] <robertmaxrees> ajax is asynchronous - you fire off the requests and the code keeps trucking along.
[13:43:58] <grez> yup
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> so that .click() method happens before the ajax is done.
[13:44:18] <robertmaxrees> which means you're not bound to to the new anchors that were brought it.
[13:44:27] <robertmaxrees> since you can't bind to what doesn't yet exist.
[13:45:06] <grez> oh ok. I see. I will see if I can figure out how to correct that. Thanks robertmaxrees
[13:45:13] <robertmaxrees> i just fixed it for you.
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> in that fixee.
[13:45:22] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead :)
[13:45:51] <robertmaxrees> you bind a delegated listener to #content that listens for clicks on any child a tags.  the nice thing is they can be added after the binding is done.
[13:46:40] <grez> ok, i see that
[13:46:50] <robertmaxrees> the alternative is to use the done callback and re-run your original bidning, but I don't like that personally becuase then you're re-running logic you don'
[13:46:54] <robertmaxrees> *don't need to run.
[13:47:11] <rominronin> hello jquery channel
[13:47:21] <rominronin> i need some guidance from the $ gods
[13:47:30] <robertmaxrees> rominronin then you're in the wrong place LOL
[13:47:34] <rominronin> ;)
[13:47:54] <rominronin> o praise be @robertmaxrees, thou hast answered my calls
[13:48:01] <robertmaxrees> yea, is it good
[13:48:20] <rominronin> I have a brain teaser:
[13:48:36] <rominronin> i have about 8 menu divs
[13:49:17] <rominronin> I want them to be alternative links to  show/hide 8 divs
[13:49:42] <rominronin> lets say class1, class2â€¦ class8
[13:49:57] <rominronin> ^ the target divs
[13:49:57] <robertmaxrees> rominronin instead of "let's say", how about you make a fiddle with your markup? :)
[13:50:15] <rominronin> ok *trots off to jsfiddle*
[13:52:28] <BillCriswell> var $links = $('a'), $divs = $('div'); $links.on('click', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); var index = $links.index(this); $divs.eq(index).toggle(); }); BOOM
[13:53:04] <robertmaxrees> stfu mister "I just recently did something exactly like this here's the fiddle i made"
[13:53:50] <BillCriswell> rominronin: Channeling the channel.
[13:53:56] <jeffmjack> if I'm using $('some stuff').next() to select a <li>, which itself contains an <a>, and I want the text inside the a tag, what should I do?
[13:54:03] <robertmaxrees> .text()
[13:54:03] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: usually nicer
[13:54:13] <robertmaxrees> .next().text() should work fine.
[13:54:27] <robertmaxrees> or .next().find('a').text(); if you want to be more specific.
[13:54:49] <jeffmjack> oh nice :) thanks!!
[13:55:33] <jeffmjack> so next('a') throws the result away unless $('some stuff') had returned an <a> tag?
[13:55:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:55:54] <robertmaxrees> ?api next
[13:55:54] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .next(): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[13:56:05] <jeffmjack> trying to understand how the optional selector inside next() works
[13:56:20] <robertmaxrees> .next('a') gets you the "next" sibling as long as it's an a tag.
[13:56:30] <jeffmjack> right and then otherwise returns nothing?
[13:56:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:56:39] <jeffmjack> cool, thanks!
[13:57:40] <rominronin> so
[13:57:42] <rominronin> Iâ€m back
[13:57:43] <rominronin> http://jsfiddle.net/rominronin/nqy4ztn2/
[13:59:10] <rominronin> I have set up the â€˜target-divâ€™ data attribute to be the same as the class of the div which I wish to target
[13:59:33] <rominronin> in other words, I want to target $(data-target-div)
[14:00:04] <rominronin> or $(â€˜.data-target-divâ€™)
[14:00:18] <rominronin> any ideas?
[14:00:41] <naomi> rominronin .data(target-div)
[14:00:43] <naomi> this is invalid
[14:00:47] <naomi> .data("target-div")
[14:01:11] <naomi> the broken syntax highlighting and error in your console should be strong indicators of the problem
[14:01:18] <naomi> rominronin ^
[14:03:23] <rominronin> @naomi thanks, Iâ€™ve updated the syntax - but my question is still unanswered
[14:03:46] <naomi> so what is your question then
[14:04:23] <rominronin> if you look at the fiddle again, I have 3 target divs
[14:04:58] <rominronin> I wish to write a single function that targets the target divs when clicked
[14:05:15] <rominronin> but it should depened on which menu div is clicked
[14:05:39] <rominronin> eg, if I click the 1st menu div, the 1st target div should be the target
[14:06:14] <rominronin> Iâ€™m attempting to do this by creating a target-div data attribute which is identical to the target class
[14:06:54] <rominronin> so instead of typing $(â€˜class-2â€™).doSomething
[14:07:44] <rominronin> I want to write a function that - in plain english - says â€˜check my target-div data attribute, THATâ€™S the div which Iâ€™m targetting, now doSomething
[14:08:04] <rominronin> comprendes?
[14:14:02] <rominronin> let me ask this another way: how can I take a string, and query the document for classes that match that string?
[14:14:53] <rominronin> so instead of $(â€˜.classâ€™) I want to get an element by class â€˜stringâ€™
[14:17:40] <rominronin> *sigh*
[14:19:10] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:19:18] <robertmaxrees> sorry was away.
[14:19:33] <rominronin> hi robertmaxrees
[14:19:55] <rominronin> just reading some stackoverflow pages, not getting much closer
[14:20:47] <robertmaxrees> so you want to open the target div whose class matches the data-target-div value?
[14:20:50] <rominronin> lots of examples on selecting an element by itâ€™s data attribute
[14:20:55] <rominronin> exaxtly
[14:21:13] <Paradisee> hello
[14:21:39] <Paradisee> is it possible to display an image over an image via css without add the img element in the html? :D
[14:21:48] <rominronin> reason for that is, I want to write ONE function that checks the clicked div for the target
[14:21:53] <Paradisee> im talking about the ajax loader
[14:22:10] <robertmaxrees> rominronin yeah 'cause you're being smart :)
[14:22:17] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nqy4ztn2/5/
[14:22:24] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:22:28] <robertmaxrees> as far as I can tell.
[14:22:37] <rominronin> am i being smart in a sarcastic way, or am i being smart properly smart?
[14:22:43] <robertmaxrees> that's actually smart.
[14:22:51] <robertmaxrees> you're decoupling logic from data - that's a good thing to do.
[14:22:52] <Paradisee> smart like the car :D
[14:23:12] <rominronin> hah
[14:23:22] <rominronin> and I tell people I should have been a developer ;)
[14:23:34] <rominronin> no one listens, no one pays me dev wages â€˜sigh'
[14:23:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:23:51] <robertmaxrees> you're being lazy - that's a good thing.
[14:24:02] <rominronin> ok, what does console.log do?
[14:24:09] <Paradisee> display you the data
[14:24:11] <Paradisee> on the console
[14:24:15] <robertmaxrees> displays data in your console.
[14:24:21] <robertmaxrees> hit f12
[14:24:29] <Paradisee> its' like an alert...but less annoying
[14:24:39] <robertmaxrees> and more indicative of actual execution.
[14:24:44] <robertmaxrees> since it doesn't block the page from running.
[14:24:55] <rominronin> works
[14:25:03] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: did you read my question?
[14:25:07] <rominronin> http://jsfiddle.net/rominronin/nqy4ztn2/6/
[14:25:30] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee i'd as in #css

[14:25:35] <rominronin> ;)
[14:25:48] <Paradisee> as ?
[14:25:51] <Paradisee> ask ?
[14:25:57] <robertmaxrees> *ask yeah
[14:26:11] <Paradisee> they're ugly
[14:26:13] <rominronin> Paradisee, you want to layer an image onto an image, but without adding an img element?
[14:26:20] <Paradisee> yap
[14:26:22] <rominronin> @robertmaxrees Thanks man
[14:26:28] <rominronin> or Thanks woman
[14:26:34] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee your question is about #css, not jquery, so it's kind of OT for here >.>
[14:26:44] <rominronin> whatever gender you may have been assigned/chosen
[14:26:50] <robertmaxrees> Male.
[14:27:07] <robertmaxrees> but you get points for at least trying to be gender-neutral.

[14:27:50] <rominronin> if you met even a quarter of the people Iâ€™m acquainted with, youâ€™d be as gender neutral - or at least gender sensitivities-aware - as I am ;)
[14:40:49] <Paradisee> why when i do something like: var position = $(clone).position();
[14:40:57] <Paradisee> the position is equal to: 0, 0 ?

[14:48:20] <Paradisee> uh
[14:48:51] <Robdgreat> (in case it wasn't evident, I was being intentionally absurd)
[14:48:55] <Omar-> try .offset()
[14:49:11] <Paradisee> i will ty
[14:50:16] <Paradisee> i still get this: Object {top: 0, left: 0}
[14:51:53] <Omar-> Paradisee hmmm i'm not a jquery expert, but $(clone) isn't in DOM i assume
[14:51:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:52:04] <Paradisee> clone is an object
[14:52:11] <Paradisee> var clone = $(ui.helper).clone();
[14:52:33] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: id like to take the position relative to a div
[14:52:40] <Omar-> yea but shouldn't it be appended?
[14:52:42] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/3HXQZWA
[14:52:49] <Paradisee> Omar-: it is

[14:53:33] <_August_> is it possible to do a fade in and slide at the sametime with jquery? i cant find anything on it, they all suggest to use animate with opecity

[14:53:37] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/

[14:54:37] <_August_> i know this is something simple but i simply cant find anything using fadein with maybe css for positioning and make it work at the sametime instead of one after the other
[14:55:32] <Paradisee> but how can i make the position relative to the container?
[14:55:47] <robertmaxrees> _August_ http://stackoverflow.com/a/3642403/923919 ?
[14:56:03] <robertmaxrees> _August_ you can also set the queue option to false, as well.
[14:56:09] <_August_> thats using animate
[14:56:16] <Paradisee> If the element's position style property is currently static, it will be set to relative to allow for this repositioning.
[14:56:50] <_August_> im using display none on some divs thats why i choose not to use animate because it doesnt really hide them it just makes them not visible
[14:56:53] <_August_> if you know what i mean
[14:56:58] <duch_kazatel> uh oh.  internet is having problems at work.
[14:57:27] <robertmaxrees> _August_ you want to use the shorthands instead of .animate()?
[14:58:04] <Omar-> ?api navigate
[14:58:04] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[14:58:31] <_August_> i could try
[14:59:16] <Omar-> jQM has no api services here?
[14:59:25] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like it.
[14:59:46] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquerymobile.com/ should suffice though.
[15:00:22] <_August_> just something that would revert the div back to display:none whenever i hover off of it. opacity doesnt do it, technically the div is still in the spot instead of being removed
[15:00:41] <robertmaxrees> _August_ can you setup a fiddle so we can see what you're trying to do?
[15:00:49] <_August_> yeah sure

[15:06:15] <DataTracer> robertmaxrees: Not sure what you mean?
[15:06:33] <robertmaxrees> "Not sure how to add the encrypted password to that array" that sounds... dangerous to me.
[15:07:26] <DataTracer> I'm getting the password the user enters into a user creation form, then encrypting that password immediately in javascript/jquery to be sent to the server side php handler
[15:07:31] <Paradisee> var counter += 1;

[15:08:02] <robertmaxrees> DataTracer oh, you don't encrypt it client-side.  you submit it securely via https and let that do the hard worlk.
[15:08:05] <robertmaxrees> *work
[15:08:10] <DataTracer> What's so dangerous about that? It's encrypted browser side before it's ever sent to the server
[15:08:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah i misunderstood what you were trying to do.
[15:08:30] <DataTracer> Ok, no worries
[15:08:42] <Omar-> Paradisee or counter++;
[15:08:48] <Paradisee> ty
[15:09:10] <Omar-> Paradisee if you want to increase counter by 1 each time it loops
[15:09:21] <robertmaxrees> doing loops?
[15:09:40] <DataTracer> I'm new to jQuery, so I'm not sure what syntax it wants to send my array properly. I'm able to send everyting straight from the form without encryption no problem
[15:10:02] <robertmaxrees> DataTracer right.  just make sure you're submitting the form via https.
[15:10:24] <DataTracer> Well, once I'm done, that will come later ;-)
[15:10:40] <DataTracer> Right now it's getting passed over http until I an finished coding
[15:10:48] <robertmaxrees> erm, i'm saying you don't need to encrypt the password client-side
[15:11:01] <DataTracer> Oh I see
[15:11:15] <robertmaxrees> so take the time to setup https.
[15:11:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:11:20] <DataTracer> Well, just for an added layer of security, I want to encode the passwords anyway
[15:11:28] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't make any sense.
[15:11:35] <Paradisee> is .done equal to success with ajax?
[15:11:39] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee no.
[15:11:41] <DataTracer> So you would store passwords in plain text???
[15:11:47] <robertmaxrees> DataTracer i encrypt them in my backend.
[15:12:08] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee .done() uses a different system. you use it instead of success.
[15:12:34] <Paradisee> what you mean with "you use it instead of success."
[15:12:43] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done();
[15:13:07] <robertmaxrees> instead of the old success callback
[15:13:21] <Paradisee> so it's almost equal right?
[15:13:32] <robertmaxrees> .done() uses the deferreds system baked into jquery.
[15:13:37] <robertmaxrees> success is deprecated.
[15:13:41] <Paradisee> ok
[15:13:49] <DataTracer> Ok, let's not focus on my design choices right now. The only trouble I'm having is with the correct array syntax. Right now I'm using: var createFormData = $("#createUserForm :input").serializeArray();
[15:14:26] <DataTracer> That gets all the key:values from every input, but how do I insert the encrypted password in that array?
[15:14:39] <robertmaxrees> DataTracer if you really want to encrypt client-side, you'd need to expose your encryption system to the client-side.
[15:14:45] <Paradisee> and .fail is equal to?
[15:15:19] <robertmaxrees> error
[15:15:23] <DataTracer> I'm ok with that
[15:15:27] <robertmaxrees> the docs talk about it all.
[15:15:38] <DataTracer> This is not mission critical stuff
[15:15:39] <robertmaxrees> you still should do everything via https btw.
[15:16:05] <robertmaxrees> but you'd have to find that element in the array and repalce it.
[15:16:10] <robertmaxrees> *replace.  let me poke at the docs.
[15:16:11] <robertmaxrees> one se.c
[15:16:26] <DataTracer> robertmaxrees thanks
[15:16:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you'd have to iterate through and look at each index's "name" property.
[15:17:09] <robertmaxrees> find the one for your password, then do myArray[5].value = newValueHere
[15:17:21] <robertmaxrees> where myArray and 5 are replaced by whatever youi need.
[15:17:38] <DataTracer> Hmm, can I do it by key name?
[15:17:49] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[15:17:52] <DataTracer> Grr
[15:17:52] <DataTracer> ok
[15:17:53] <robertmaxrees> you have to loop through the array.
[15:18:36] <DataTracer> Ok, so I know how I would do that in perl, but I'm kinda new to js/jquery
[15:19:11] <robertmaxrees> okay, what do you need to know?
[15:19:22] <DataTracer> So I guess I would still keep this array the same... var createFormData = $("#createUserForm :input").serializeArray();
[15:19:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:19:35] <DataTracer> Then either use a for or while loop?
[15:19:43] <robertmaxrees> a for loop.
[15:19:50] <DataTracer> ok
[15:19:58] <robertmaxrees> what browsers do you need to support?
[15:20:04] <DataTracer> let me see if I can figure it out for a minute
[15:20:54] <robertmaxrees> because you could use indexOf()
[15:21:09] <DataTracer> Ugg, ok, just noticed a new issue I have to deal with. Once the array has been looped through and changed, I'll have to create a new array I supposed to pass to my .post()
[15:21:21] <robertmaxrees> huh
[15:21:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:21:27] <robertmaxrees> you can modify that array in place.
[15:21:35] <DataTracer> oh ok, good
[15:21:41] <DataTracer> Oh duh, that's right
[15:22:05] <DataTracer> hang on. I gotta wrap my brain around this thing for amoment :-)
[15:24:29] <Respek> robertmaxrees: what linter do you use?
[15:24:40] <robertmaxrees> jshint gutter for sublime text 2
[15:24:47] <robertmaxrees> which requires you have node installed.
[15:24:52] <Respek> noted
[15:25:03] <robertmaxrees> with this config: https://gist.github.com/robertmaxrees/5e1d67b3f10fc014f932
[15:25:19] <Respek> just install though package control?
[15:25:25] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:25:45] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-JSHint
[15:27:08] <Respek> Do I just paste that gist over jshintrc?
[15:27:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah - make sure you're on the right one.
[15:27:47] <Respek> yep, .jshintrc
[15:28:55] <robertmaxrees> there might be other ones in your setup for other plugins - doing jssetlint in the command palatte should get you the right one.
[15:30:12] <robertmaxrees> might need to restart sublime text, too.  otherwise, you can use ctrl+alt+j on windows to lint the file.
[15:30:23] <Paradisee> why do i get float position? http://dpaste.com/0XNBGWP
[15:31:29] <robertmaxrees> from what?
[15:31:41] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/2C08G51
[15:32:01] <robertmaxrees> which line?
[15:32:18] <Respek> robertmaxrees: looks great, thanks
[15:32:35] <Paradisee> 24
[15:32:50] <robertmaxrees> Respek feel free to tweak that.  i'm a hardass about my own formatting :)
[15:33:11] <Respek> I'll stand on your shoulders for now
[15:33:14] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:34:01] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee ooooh you mean why are there decimels in the positions?
[15:34:09] <Paradisee> y
[15:34:13] <robertmaxrees> (js only has one number type, so i though you meant something else)
[15:34:20] <robertmaxrees> because that's how the browser calculated it.
[15:34:52] <Paradisee> is there a way to get the relative position?
[15:35:06] <robertmaxrees> relative to the parent?
[15:35:10] <Paradisee> ya
[15:35:13] <robertmaxrees> ?api position
[15:35:13] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[15:35:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:37:31] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: there aren't reference on the api page
[15:37:59] <robertmaxrees> the definition of the method is to get the coordinates relative to the offset parent.
[15:38:25] <robertmaxrees> not entirely sure what you're really looking ofr.
[15:38:27] <robertmaxrees> *for
[15:38:46] <Paradisee> i just need to get the position of an element inside the div
[15:38:55] <Paradisee> but relative to it
[15:38:59] <robertmaxrees> that's what .position() does.
[15:39:08] <Paradisee> nope
[15:40:24] <Omar-> lol
[15:40:32] <robertmaxrees> then the api documentation is incorrect ;)
[15:40:41] <robertmaxrees> can you provide an example of your markup/styles?
[15:41:08] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/1RV0V2N
[15:41:26] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/3S6CF09
[15:41:27] <robertmaxrees> in jsfiddle, preferably.
[15:41:31] <Omar-> Paradisee var child_pos = $(child).offset().top - $(parent).offset().top;
[15:41:54] <robertmaxrees> Omar- they want it relative to the element's parent.
[15:42:03] <Paradisee> he*
[15:42:27] <robertmaxrees> kay
[15:42:30] <Paradisee> :D
[15:43:11] <Omar-> robertmaxrees this will return position of child within parent, no?
[15:43:36] <robertmaxrees> oiffset is relative to the document.
[15:43:47] <robertmaxrees> position is relative to the offset parent.
[15:44:00] <robertmaxrees> that's the entire point of position.
[15:44:56] <Paradisee> so why position doesnt return it correctly?
[15:45:23] <robertmaxrees> might be related to the note: on the documentation?
[15:45:28] <Omar-> Paradisee can setup a fiddle?
[15:45:43] <Paradisee> you can't even read the console.log
[15:45:47] <Paradisee> i think it's useless
[15:45:49] <robertmaxrees> yes you can.
[15:45:52] <Paradisee> really?
[15:46:00] <robertmaxrees> f12 on your keyboard.
[15:46:05] <Paradisee> ok
[15:46:06] <robertmaxrees> you have one built into your browser.

[15:55:08] <Paradisee> this is better
[15:55:13] <robertmaxrees> that's the same thing.

[15:56:19] <Paradisee> the black border rapresent the relative i want
[15:57:20] <robertmaxrees> ah, yep, the docs pointed this part out.
[15:57:23] <robertmaxrees> funky glitch though.
[15:57:48] <robertmaxrees> "Note: jQuery does not support getting the position coordinates of hidden elements or accounting for borders, margins, or padding set on the body element."
[15:59:34] <Paradisee> am i fucked up?
[15:59:59] <Omar-> Paradisee nope, there should be a workaround
[16:02:27] <Omar-> Paradisee http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/fxobw1oL/2/
[16:02:45] <Paradisee> yay
[16:04:12] <Omar-> Paradisee http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/fxobw1oL/3/ beter
[16:04:15] <Omar-> better*
[16:04:29] <robertmaxrees> btw use .prop() and not .attr()
[16:04:41] <Omar-> robertmaxrees +1
[16:05:04] <Paradisee> how
[16:05:17] <robertmaxrees> every place you have .attr(, replace it with .prop(
[16:05:21] <robertmaxrees> exact same syntaxt otherwise.
[16:06:20] <Omar-> robertmaxrees if an element has an attribute, using .attr() wont harm
[16:06:30] <Omar-> but yes, I recommend .prop()
[16:06:47] <robertmaxrees> erm, .prop() to access attributes is still preferable.
[16:06:56] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 you want to access the DOM, not the markup.
[16:07:15] <Omar-> exactly
[16:07:45] <robertmaxrees> while .attr() might work, .prop() is still preferable.
[16:08:08] <Paradisee> var category = ui.draggable.prop('data-category');
[16:08:11] <Paradisee> it doesnt work
[16:08:12] <Omar-> .prop will work 100% under any conditions
[16:08:14] <robertmaxrees> .data('category')
[16:08:29] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee data attributes should use .data()
[16:08:49] <Paradisee> ok
[16:08:58] <Omar-> ?api data
[16:08:58] <b-ot> Omar-: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/

[16:09:47] <Paradisee> i should add jquery to my irc bot
[16:10:14] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: do you need a bot here?
[16:10:19] <robertmaxrees> we have one.
[16:10:21] <robertmaxrees> b-ot
[16:10:31] <Paradisee> it works with wiki, google, urban dict and some others
[16:10:32] <robertmaxrees> you just saw it in action :)
[16:10:38] <Paradisee> written in python, and open source
[16:10:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd say we're good to go at this point, but thanks anyway.
[16:10:53] <robertmaxrees> the current bot does what we need.
[16:10:56] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery
[16:10:57] <Omar-> Paradisee does it cook?
[16:10:58] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: jQuery â†’ http://jquery.com/
[16:11:09] <Paradisee> well for me isn't a problem...it is on my server 24/24
[16:11:22] <robertmaxrees> it'll conflict with the current one and might cause issues is what i'm saying.
[16:11:26] <robertmaxrees> but thanks anyway :)
[16:11:49] <Paradisee> https://bitbucket.org/Paradisee/irc-bot/src
[16:11:54] <Paradisee> got it here ^
[16:12:02] <Omar-> gtg now
[16:12:07] <Omar-> nighty everyone
[16:12:10] <Paradisee> bye Omar- :)
[16:12:13] <Paradisee> thanks for helping
[16:12:20] <Omar-> my pleasure Paradisee :)
[16:12:24] <Paradisee> ;)
[16:14:17] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: the idea now...is to change the value of the position when i drag the item just dropped
[16:14:33] <Paradisee> it has to send new value to the server via json
[16:15:02] <Paradisee> but i'm pretty tired...i will work on it tomorrow
[16:15:18] <gnu_d> Hi, I'm trying to force change event, I tried: $('#element').trigger('autocompletechange'); it worked somehow, but after refresh doesn't work anymore, does someone know anything about autocomplete triggering change event ?
[16:15:50] <Paradisee> gnu_d: could you provide a fiddle?
[16:16:29] <gnu_d> Paradisee: it just a call, there is no code, there isn't any bug in my code, I just need theoretical answer.
[16:16:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:16:51] <Paradisee> ?api trigger
[16:16:51] <b-ot> Paradisee: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[16:16:54] <robertmaxrees> without seeing what you're doing, it's hard to know how to "theoretically" answer.
[16:17:07] <Paradisee> gnu_d: give a look to it ^
[16:17:17] <opreaadrian> gnu_d: Did you have dev tools open when refreshing the page?
[16:17:20] <Paradisee> im going to bed, see you tomorrow, thanks again robertmaxrees o/
[16:17:41] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[16:17:45] <opreaadrian> Dev tools has this neat feature where you can disable caching for the current page if it is open.
[16:18:01] <opreaadrian> Maybe that's what messed up your autocomplete
[16:18:23] <gnu_d> opreaadrian: random code execution messed up the DOM.
[16:32:33] <skinux> How can we detect which 'link' of an HTML Image Map has been clicked?
[16:33:19] <robertmaxrees> sure.  $('area').on('click', function() { console.log(this) });
[16:33:26] <robertmaxrees> `this` will be the element that was clicked.
[16:33:35] <skinux> How about redirecting page?
[16:33:39] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:33:47] <robertmaxrees> the link it'd take you to?
[16:34:01] <robertmaxrees> what does the markup look like?
[16:35:25] <skinux> <area shape="rect" coords="89,24,670,117" href="example.com" alt="Home" title="Home"    />
[16:35:32] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('href'), then
[16:36:03] <robertmaxrees> or this.href
[16:36:30] <skinux> That would catch ANY link that has been clicked and not just imap map links right?
[16:36:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:36:53] <skinux> In this case, I only want JQ to catch link clicks from the imap map.
[16:37:02] <robertmaxrees> $('area').on('click', function() { console.log(this) }); will only catch clicks on area tags.
[16:37:33] <skinux> Thanks.
[16:38:10] <w00tb3ast> I'm running a $.ajax request on a URL that is taking a while to respond. On success I just want to store the result in a variable, the syntax for my code is correct but because the server is taking too long to respond it doesn't seem to have all the data before it tries to run the next line of code and as a result throws an unexpected end of input
[16:38:40] <robertmaxrees> w00tb3ast you have to put any logic that relies on the ajax request completing in the .done() callback of the request.
[18:00:34] <jimi_> I need to autocomplete / search some list. The list is potentially 250k records. Currently, I am doing an ajax call to a backend process that does the querying from a database and returns the results as json. Given that the list is fixed, does it make sense to store it in a session, or some other variable, and then query it in memory in JS instead of through the network?
[18:01:01] <robertmaxrees> don't return 250k results to your frontend at a time D:
[18:01:34] <robertmaxrees> query and return the small subset you're actually going to display.
[18:02:09] <jimi_> robertmaxrees, That's what I'm doing now. Just didn't know if it made sense since it is static data to have it some where  that might have less overhead, or keep from having to query so often, but i agree with you
[18:03:11] <robertmaxrees> nah, too much data.
[18:03:12] <jimi_> Also, I am currently searching on key up, after the 2nd character. On character 3, fire, 4, fire, etc. Since these are asynchronous, they sometimes come back out of order, and the results get mixed up. Should I cancel or .abort() the previous xhtr?
[18:03:16] <robertmaxrees> and js would be too slow.
[18:03:24] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:03:36] <robertmaxrees> or debounce the keypresses.
[18:07:15] <jimi_> robertmaxrees, can i do it like $(document).on('keyup', $('#diagnosis_search'), $.debounce(function() {}); ?or does it only work on like $('#foo').on('keyup', debounce....)
[18:07:35] <robertmaxrees> 1. that's not how you do delegated listeners
[18:07:54] <robertmaxrees> 2. it depends on the debouncing lib you use
[18:08:12] <jimi_> what is wrong w/ that listener?
[18:08:24] <robertmaxrees>  $(document).on('keyup', '#diagnosis_search', $.debounce(function()
[18:08:29] <robertmaxrees> should be a selector, not an object
[18:08:34] <robertmaxrees> and bind further down the document if you can.
[18:08:53] <robertmaxrees> if you're using ben alman's lib,  $(document).on('keyup', '#diagnosis_search', $.debounce(function() {}); should work just fine.
[18:11:50] <tw2113> evening ryanneufeld
[18:17:08] <tds016> hi all. I am getting a 501 response from a CORS request to a PUT request.
[18:17:12] <tds016> any idea what would cause this?
[18:17:21] <tds016> I'm setting the cors header properly, I think....
[18:17:45] <tds016> I'm able to make a get request to the server and get the response (I have PUT explicitly listed too)
[18:17:58] <tds016> but it look like when I write the PUT request I get back a 501 on an OPTIONS request.
[18:18:03] <tds016> not sure what might be happening.
[18:28:28] <shoky> tds016: that's a cors preflight request. you need to respond properly with cors headers for the options request too
[18:30:23] <tds016> actually... I realized what I did shoky, I didn't actually have anything replying at teh OPTIONS endpoint.
[18:30:37] <tds016> lol. So now I have it that any options request will give a blank response with the proper headers.
[18:30:42] <tds016> damn, that was annoying. lol.
[18:31:12] <tds016> Next question... how would I JSON.stringify() something that looks like this:
[18:31:22] <tds016> {foo: {bar:baz}}
[18:31:40] <shoky> hmm?
[18:31:41] <tds016> when I do JSON.stringify() I end up with {foo:{}) and none of my bar:baz
[18:32:18] <shoky> what's the bar:baz..?
[18:32:23] <tds016> I basically want to send this in the body of a request.
[18:32:24] <trewd6> $("#textinput").on("propertychange keyup input paste blur", function (e) { doFunc(); }
[18:32:30] <trewd6> how come doFunc() gets called twice?
[18:32:38] <tds016> it's just a few more values in a dictionary.
[18:32:49] <trewd6> everytime I type something into that text input
[18:32:50] <shoky> trewd6: because multiple events are being triggered probably
[18:32:56] <tds016> so I have a dictionary of dictionaries; it's basically just a complex object.
[18:33:12] <trewd6> shoky: how can I make sure only one call is made?
[18:33:22] <trewd6> without deleting the events
[18:33:39] <shoky> only one call is made, when?
[18:33:59] <trewd6> shoky: when I type something in
[18:34:38] <shoky> in modern browsers the input event should be enough
[18:37:06] <shoky> otherwise, you can use a throttle i guess. or there's some nicer way to deal with it that i don't recall at the moment
[18:37:59] <tds016> any ideas what would cause json.stringify() to work properly with nested objects?
[18:38:04] <shebbi> Hi, why when I do $.ajax in a jQuery dialog, and on server-side process the ajax request and then do a redirect, the page gets loaded into the jQuery Dialog!
[18:38:06] <shoky> though for older browsers i just use keyup usually. couldn't care less about giving full 100% functionality for edge cases, for people on ie8
[18:40:47] <shoky> tds016: there's stuff like properties having a "toJSON" method, also json.stringify won't catch properties on the prototype chain
[18:41:06] <shoky> or unenumerable properties, i think
[18:41:15] <tds016> I don't want properties; I just want the data :-)
[18:41:27] <shoky> {foo:..}   foo is a propertty
[18:42:32] <tds016> oh, I see.
[18:42:42] <tds016> how would I go about encoding this to a string properly then?
[18:42:47] <tds016> or there is no clean way to do this?
[18:43:15] <shoky> don't really know what your scenario is that's causing it
[18:44:37] <tds016> {"myFoo": {"this": "bar", "is": baz"}}
[18:44:53] <tds016> that is the type of json not being stringified properly.
[18:44:54] <tds016> lol.
[18:45:39] <shoky> js> print( JSON.stringify( {"myFoo": {"this": "bar", "is": "baz"}} ) )
[18:45:44] <b-ot> shoky: No output.
[18:45:51] <shoky> damn you b-ot
[18:46:00] <ul71m0> Hey guys, i have issue only with ie9, its like my .toggle isnt working. On this page http://sethg.net/dev/asi/about-us/employment-opportunities/ accordions doesnt open only in ie9
[18:46:14] <shoky> tds016: works fine  http://jsfiddle.net/mj9cw7s9/
[18:46:27] <ul71m0> im trying to figure out whats the issue but no luck
[18:47:06] <shoky> js> 5
[18:47:10] <b-ot> shoky: No output.
[18:47:43] <tds016> ballz... I have no idea what this things issue is. lol.
[18:49:14] <shoky> where you getting this object from? or who is setting these missing properties? also what makes you say they're there
[18:52:07] <sammych1> so, JS doesn't have block scoping
[18:52:29] <shoky> it does in ES6
[18:52:37] <sammych1> so does that mean that I should put the "var" in "for (var i = blah...) {} " at the top?
[18:52:40] <sammych1> heh yeah
[18:52:47] <tds016> http://jsfiddle.net/eo5e8qt1/
[18:52:50] <sammych1> well "var i"
[18:52:54] <tds016> shoky: what am I doing wrong there?
[18:53:02] <sammych1> the top of the function*
[18:54:04] <shoky> sammych1 yes, imo, if you want to avoid confusion
[18:54:24] <tds016> shoky: I am able to get your fiddle to work; I'm not sure what is different betnween the two aside from me grabbing vale from a .val()
[18:54:55] <sammych1> doing the 'right thing' and making old(er) code of mine more 'best practicey'
[18:55:24] <tds016> it looks like that might actually be the issue.... it's that I'm using $('#small').val() am I incorrect in doing that?
[18:55:34] <shoky> tds016: JSON.stringify also doesn't print undefined properties
[18:55:49] <shoky> tds016: you're using $('small').val()  which is incorrect
[18:56:30] <tds016> holy shit.
[18:56:33] <tds016> wow... I'm an idiot.
[18:56:34] <tds016> thanks.
[18:56:38] <shoky> ;p
[18:56:57] <shoky> sammych1: then just ditch "for" altogether :)
[18:57:27] <shoky> sammych1: use .forEach, .map, .filter, .reduce  etc.  which already give you a function scope for inside the loop, and other goodies
[18:57:52] <sammych1> this is true
[18:58:21] <shoky> and they help de-clutter your code with silly useless indexes too
[18:58:33] <sammych1> also very true
[18:59:16] <sammych1> not used them in the past because I thought the support wasn't broad
[18:59:28] <sammych1> then again, I didn't really do the legwork to find out
[19:00:17] * sammych1 does the legwork now
[19:00:33] <shoky> if you need to support older browsers you can use jquery's equivalent $.each $.map $.grep  (or another library's)
[19:01:01] <sammych1> I don't really need the closure, though
[19:01:22] <sammych1> while it's trivial performance hit to use $.X, I stuck with the old loop
[19:02:43] <sammych1> I can use forEach in all my supported browsers anyway, so I guess I'll start that
[19:03:30] <sammych1> on that point, creating a closure/scope is rather expensive, though
[19:03:43] <shoky> nah
[19:03:44] <sammych1> again, not that performance is a big deal
[19:04:16] <shoky> even if it was. this would not affect your performance
[19:04:55] <sammych1> http://jsperf.com/array-map-vs-loop/8
[19:05:12] <shoky> jsperf performance != your app's performance
[19:05:40] <shoky> even if it was a bigger hit, it's not something to care about until you have a reason to
[19:05:40] <sammych1> you'll need to expand on that
[19:06:13] <sammych1> you're pretty much talking about over-optimising
[19:06:38] <sammych1> but in this case, the status-quo is a for-loop, so
[19:06:45] <sammych1> for me*
[19:06:56] <shoky> talking about premature optimization
[19:07:45] <shoky> anyway the jsperf shows that even the "slow" one does around 1.5 mil ops per second
[19:10:37] <ljdevs_> Question guys, howto you inspect inserted html from a  plugin if it does this?
[19:10:38] <ljdevs_> http://screencast.com/t/si3dnHASTfys
[19:12:36] <shoky> good question
[19:17:58] <BillCriswell> ljdevs_: Can the "Break On... Subtree Modification" option help
[19:20:56] <ljdevs_> not reallyh elpful, does anyone ever used typeahead before?
[19:21:43] <BillCriswell> Hmm.
[19:22:47] <ljdevs_> What I mean't was it just doesn't tell me anything useful to fix the problem. I see it empties the templates, etc.
[19:23:04] <sammych1> I usually run 'debugger' in console after an interval
[19:23:34] <sammych1> that'll stop everything and let you inspect
[19:26:07] <sammych1> ljdevs_: did you get that?
[19:26:18] <BillCriswell> ljdevs_: It's a little dirty but you can do $('.typeahead').off('blur');
[19:27:00] <sammych1> setTimeout(function() { debugger;}, 2000); // enough time for you to click and do stuff
[19:27:36] <shebbi> Hi, why when I do $.ajax in a jQuery dialog, and on server-side process the ajax request and then do a redirect, the page gets loaded into the jQuery Dialog!
[19:27:58] <BillCriswell> sammych1: Ah nice.
[19:28:14] <BillCriswell> ljdevs_: I dig sammych1 solutions.
[19:28:29] <ljdevs_> Ok thanks
[19:28:44] <ljdevs_> This plugin is pretty damn complicated.
[19:30:04] <ljdevs_> how do you turn off chroms debugger?
[19:30:09] <ljdevs_> won't let me load the page...
[19:30:43] <sammych1> F8
[19:30:51] <sammych1> or the play button in 'Source'
[19:30:56] <ljdevs_> nvm
[19:30:59] <ljdevs_> Thanks
[19:31:11] <sammych1> or close the inspector
[19:32:28] <sammych1> talked to a colleague for a few minutes. He sits next to a window. Now I have retina burn and I can't see
[19:33:18] <shebbi> sammych1: wear sunglasses
[19:33:52] <sammych1> inside?
[19:36:28] <shebbi> sammych1: Sure, if it's sunny inside too.
[19:37:51] <shebbi> sammych1: You can get transition lenses too, so the lense will adjust to how much sun there is. Incase you're worried about looking too cool inside.
[19:39:42] <ljdevs_> I'm trying to bind an event to a nput field along with typeahead events to it (it's a if focus, add a class) but for some reason it doesn't work. How is typeahead making the event attach fail?
[19:46:47] <shebbi> Does anyone know the solution to my problem? I've posted already but no response.
[19:46:56] <shebbi> here it is again:

[20:24:43] <Rees> Hello, Is anyone on that might be able to provide me some assistance with a strange bug I'm having
[20:25:35] <il> Rees, hi
[20:25:47] <Rees> Hi there il
[20:27:19] <Rees> ill just post the problem out here and see if anyone can help
[20:27:45] <Rees> we are running an application called Jive which has Jquery 1.8.3
[20:28:43] <Rees> we have 2 custome code blocks (unfortunately frames) that us query .load() on the same page
[20:29:01] <Rees> IE11 completely locks up when both are present on the page
[20:29:16] <Rees> the freeze lasts for about 45 seconds
[20:29:40] <Rees> i have narrowed it down to the .load calls
[20:30:56] <Rees> and that should have said iframes
[20:32:03] <gnarf> can you restate "that us query .load()"
[20:32:19] <gnarf> like $("#someframe").load('url') ?
[20:32:31] <gnarf> or inside the frame source, things are using .load?
[20:33:19] <gnarf> can you show some of the code around the load on pastebin or gist?
[20:33:50] <gnarf> and how exactly did you "narrow it down" to that?
[20:36:00] <Rees> http://pastebin.com/zzb1V9pg
[20:36:32] <Rees> thats a small snippet of it
[20:36:37] <gnarf> resultArea2 is?
[20:37:05] <Rees> $j("#tempStock");
[20:38:29] <gnarf> Rees: and it's an iframe?
[20:38:33] <gnarf> or is it a div?
[20:38:52] <Rees> iframe
[20:39:40] <gnarf> does that do what you think it does?
[20:40:39] <gnarf> frames are confusing
[20:40:44] <gnarf> i think .load() uses .html()
[20:40:56] <gnarf> its meant to be used on a div
[20:41:01] <Rees> there are 2 widgets on the page. Both are in their own frames. both have the code snipet i sent just with the other having different variable names and function names
[20:41:02] <gnarf> is the html returned a full page?
[20:41:12] <Rees> each works fine n its own
[20:41:15] <Rees> *on
[20:41:32] <gnarf> so each frame has a frame?
[20:42:12] <Rees> no, each of the instances of this code are in separate iframes
[20:42:20] <Rees> they are the only 2 frames on the page
[20:42:27] <Rees> the rest is standard html
[20:43:09] <Rees> i should also mention that while the browser is frozen 1 core of the cpu is pegged
[20:44:51] <Rees> i was able to narrow it down to the load calls with alerts. the alert directly before it worked fine. but the on completion before the check to see if it errored occurred after it pulled out of the freeze
[20:46:30] <Rees> I'm not seeing any errors in the console nor any indications in profiler
[20:46:43] <Rees> it doesn't occur in IE 8 or FF or Chrome
[20:48:07] <gnarf> Rees: first of all "alert" is not a debugging tool
[20:48:17] <gnarf> it actually stops execution and can throw off the tests
[20:48:20] <gnarf> try console.logs
[20:48:37] <gnarf> second - .load isn't intended for an iframe
[20:48:51] <gnarf> though if it works, i wouldn't be surprised
[20:49:27] <gnarf> .load is an alias to $.ajax(url).then(function(html) { resultArea2.html(html)}, function(error) { ... });
[20:50:07] <gnarf> have you tried using the "profiling" tools in ie11's debugger?
[20:51:11] <gnarf> Rees: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/load.js
[20:51:28] <gnarf> Rees: i'm pretty sure that .html() on an iframe is like "unsafe"
[20:51:58] <gnarf> you might be able to make those things just divs
[20:52:04] <gnarf> or you should be setting the .src on the iframe
[20:52:31] <Rees> If i could do that i would
[20:52:43] <Rees> the jive software pisses me off
[20:53:26] <Rees> these are HTML widgets and as soon as jive sees a script tag it loads them as frames instead of inline HTML
[20:53:31] <Rees> *iframes
[20:54:05] <gnarf> Rees: then change window.location, or submit a form to cause the frame to navigate to a new url if that is your actual intent
[20:54:41] <gnarf> if the intent is to change some html, you want to change some html on an element like a div inside the frame (because the script is also, inside the frame)
[20:55:10] <Rees> we have a rest api call that updates a Document in the Jive application
[20:55:44] <Rees> this javascript pulls a table out of that page and parses the fields and displays the data as a stock ticker
[20:56:12] <Rees> its a hack but its unfortunately the only way we have atm
[20:56:29] <gnarf> Rees: still, use a profiler
[20:57:03] <Rees> thats what i have been doing in iee ff and chrome... when i try to do it in IE11 it closes the profiler on page load
[20:57:36] <Rees> i was able to do the profiler in ie8, ff, and chrome
[20:57:48] <Rees> and didn't see anything
[20:59:23] <gnarf> Rees: sorry, seems like theres very specific environmental things at play here, what i can tell you is that calling jQuery.fn.load() on an iframe is probably not going to work "right" ever - try doing it by changing the src, or something, cross frames a pain
[20:59:28] <gnarf> `glwt
[20:59:37] <gnarf> `glwtd
[20:59:38] <b-ot> gnarf: Good Luck With That Dude â†’ http://glwtd.com/
[20:59:41] <gnarf> ^^^ there
[20:59:47] <gnarf> i gotta head to bed
[21:00:09] <Rees> actually the div its adjusting is in its own frame
[21:00:18] <Rees> or i should say
[21:00:22] <Rees> shares the same frame
[21:00:35] <Rees> thanks for trying though
[21:00:44] <Rees> I'm going to see if i can get profiler working
[21:01:08] <gnarf> okay so resultArea is a div then, not a frame
[21:01:25] <gnarf> in that case, try using just $.ajax directly
[21:01:50] <Rees> can you load just a portion of the dom the same way load does
[21:02:01] <Rees> or will that require additional code
[21:02:07] <gnarf> Rees: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/load.js#L60-L62
[21:02:31] <gnarf> Rees: i mean, pull it out a level so you can see if its parsing, or finding, or what is actually blocking you
[21:02:44] <gnarf> or just switch to uncompressed jquery and try adding some debugging in there too
[21:02:48] <gnarf> with console.logs
[21:02:50] <gnarf> not alerts
[21:02:51] <gnarf> :)
[21:03:08] <Rees> will do thanks
[21:03:27] <shebbi> hi guys, looking for code for checking email is valid in jQuery. help
[21:04:43] <systemfault> if (email.indexOf('@') !== -1) { }
[21:05:16] <Uhkis> worst check ever :)
[21:07:40] <shebbi> seems regex is the best solution for this
[21:08:12] <systemfault> Mine is the best solution... because a RFC-compatible regex would be longer than your arm.
[21:08:18] <systemfault> It's totally pointless.
[21:08:40] <systemfault> If the user wants to write crap, he will just write it in a way that it passes your check.
[21:08:46] <Uhkis> yeah, @_@ is a fine email ;-)
[21:09:21] <systemfault> Uhkis: Even if you have the perfect RFC-compatible regex... the user will just do: ajhdkjashdkjhKJ@asdasdkjhsd.com
[21:09:29] <systemfault> It doesn't prevent anything.
[21:09:30] <shebbi> any agree that systemfault answer is the best??
[21:09:40] <Uhkis> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2507030/email-validation-using-jquery there's a bunch of premade regexes
[21:10:25] <Uhkis> systemfault: that is also true
[21:10:26] <systemfault> Uhkis: What is the purpose of email validation?
[21:10:55] <systemfault> (Hint: There's none)
[21:11:25] <Uhkis> well you can validate and error out guerrillamail and such
[21:11:26] <shebbi> I disagree with you on that one
[21:11:40] <Uhkis> that's about it
[21:12:18] <systemfault> shebbi: The only difference with validation is that I'm going to have a @ and a . in the crap I'm going to type in the "email" field, that's my point.
[21:12:40] <systemfault> no validation: ajdkjsadlajsdhkjashdkjahs   with validation akjdhsakjdhakjH@asdkjajsdha.com
[21:12:55] <systemfault> In both case, I'm sending you crap.
[21:13:43] <shebbi> systemfault: point is to limit the crap
[21:13:56] <Uhkis> well, @ and . validation should at least prevent some typos
[21:14:05] <shebbi> systemfault: or rather reduce the crap
[21:14:13] <systemfault> It won't... the only good way is to limit the crap is "confirmation email" :(
[21:14:44] <systemfault> Anyway :) Just pick one of the regexes on the SO
[21:14:55] <shebbi> systemfault: SO?
[21:15:01] <systemfault> StackOverflow
[21:15:06] <systemfault> The link Uhkis pasted earlier
[21:15:07] <shebbi> ah, yeh.
[21:15:47] <systemfault> shebbi: The one with verimail looks great
[21:16:03] <systemfault> It will actually help the user to not enter crap.
[21:16:08] <shebbi> systemfault: Yours was OK, just didn't have enough checks. it didn't check for the '.' and the length of the email address
[21:16:10] <systemfault> Or typos.
[21:16:59] <systemfault> I might use this in the future... I'll see https://github.com/amail/Verimail.js
[21:18:20] <Uhkis> that looks pretty good indeed
[21:22:12] <systemfault> I forgot how long a "proper" email validation regex is...
[21:22:20] <systemfault> Behold:
[21:22:20] <systemfault> (?:[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|"(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21-\x5a\x53-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])+)\])
[21:22:39] <Fall> Whoa
[21:24:29] <Uhkis> systemfault: that's for RFC?
[21:25:08] <systemfault> Yeah, supposedly
[21:28:04] <shebbi> systemfault: looks fine to me. Probably still shorter than many js code.
[21:32:17] <tw2113> systemfault, how did you get my nickserv password?
[21:32:48] <tw2113> :>
[21:33:49] <thepro4ever> is a string literal "TestString" not considered valid json format?
[21:33:52] <thepro4ever> i have my jackson json api sending back a string literal to my browser and my browser ajax json call is complaining about a json parser error
[21:34:25] <systemfault> tw2113 :)
[21:37:53] <thepro4ever> firebug only says json.parseError
[21:38:30] <Uhkis> thepro4ever: how about showing us the full json?
[21:40:22] <thepro4ever> i can't see what it is i don't know how to see what firebug sees besides json.parseError
[21:41:22] <thepro4ever> i just know that when i run a test of what the servlet would have returned it would have been in the format "testString", i use the jackson json api to automatically convert objects to json and when it is passed a String object it just returns it in the format "stringObj"
[22:57:44] <shebbi> why can't i see the sourcode in a jquery dialog? i use IE console mode and still don't see it visible

[23:53:03] <jammsen> is there jquery way of checking if a object in a variable is set?
[23:53:25] <jammsen> im trying it with normal js and im lost -> if ((typeof (data.hpuser) === 'undefined') && (typeof (data.account) === 'undefined') && (typeof (data.charlist) === 'undefined') && (typeof (data.guildlist) === 'undefined')) {
[23:53:35] <jammsen> it still throws an error
[23:54:26] <mooncup> you need !== 'undefined'
[23:54:31] <mooncup> or possibly !=
[23:55:35] <guzzlefry> Is the attribute selector unreliable when it comes to data attributes?
[23:57:27] <jammsen> mooncup: i tried that http://pastebin.com/XjXGLMCc is not working
[23:57:28] <advcha> Paradisee : I've changed the fiddle to add the jquery and jquery ui framework. here is the link : http://jsfiddle.net/Lngzbjc6/5/
[23:59:37] <guzzlefry> well, to answer my question, yes :P
[23:59:40] <advcha> Paradisee : if you type 'ba', some cities would be appear. If you select one of them. Bangkok for example and then press a spacebar, another dropdown appear like 'Bangkok Accommodation',..
