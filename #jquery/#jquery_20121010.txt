[00:00:08] <hetii> ahh, ok if its what you mean then yes :)
[00:04:04] <jacta> Can someone help me implement a feature on resize of browser, already the picture only fills 80% of the viewpoint - how can I get it to work on resize? http://jsfiddle.net/UNcUA/1/
[00:08:28] <jacta> or well, the function is in the script, but can I call ___calculateImageDimension on resize?
[00:15:55] <luckykj> hey
[00:15:59] <iSeeDeadPixels> hi
[00:16:09] <luckykj> hi
[00:16:27] <AdamPDotty> hay
[00:16:41] <axscode> how to return the number of options items in a <select id="target"> using jquery..\
[00:17:11] <AdamPDotty> $('#target').find('option').length
[00:17:31] <axscode> ah find
[00:17:37] <AdamPDotty> $('#target option').length
[00:17:56] <axscode> which is faster? and optimised?
[00:18:03] <AdamPDotty> $('#target>option').length
[00:19:08] <harshada_> hey how to disabled multiple select in jstree, i used ui:{select_multiple_modifer:false} but its not working.. still m able to select multiple node
[00:19:22] <axscode> how about, check which nth child is that selector.
[00:20:50] <jacta> AdamPDotty, do you have time for a advice, or if lucky a quick way to solve something :)
[00:22:52] <dthree> HI what css and js compressor do you recomend?
[00:31:21] <AdamPDotty> jacta: I still do not get what your problem is
[00:32:15] <jacta> AdamPDotty, when you click on the on of the images, i opens up and fill viewport up to 80% - I want this feature also on resize
[00:32:31] <jacta> its already implemented on "load" of images
[00:33:43] <AdamPDotty> I am not sure that is 80%, but it does resize
[00:35:31] <jacta> pictures are quite big - and they are scaled to 80% of viewpoint on load
[00:35:46] <jacta> so if you reisze browser and load a new picture it fits screen
[00:35:50] <TheBrayn> how can I iterate over all elements with a certain class of a certain type??
[00:35:55] <TheBrayn> -?
[00:36:31] <AdamPDotty> brayn: each()
[00:36:38] <TheBrayn> thanks
[00:38:01] <AdamPDotty> so I guess for me it doesnt size on load
[00:38:12] <AdamPDotty> looks like full screen
[00:38:50] <AdamPDotty> Ã¤hhm, and it loads the picture
[00:38:58] <AdamPDotty> not a page containing the picture
[00:39:09] <AdamPDotty> jquery does not work in pictures
[00:44:42] <jacta> hmmm
[00:47:43] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. I'm doing a responsive design
[00:47:50] <jaffipaffi> Where the menu is a <select>
[00:47:52] <jacta> youre right, but with old source its really different, one second adam_lynch
[00:47:55] <jacta> AdamPDotty,
[00:48:04] <jaffipaffi> But I'd like to hide that, and trigger it from a link
[00:48:08] <jaffipaffi> Is that possible with jQuery?
[00:48:19] <jaffipaffi> I've tried $('select').trigger('click') with no luck
[00:52:03] <PlasmaBunny> hi

[00:55:40] <TheBrayn> https://gist.github.com/3863898 this script should "close" a tr when a certain link inside the tr is clicked but if I open the element, close it, open it again and then close it it disappears
[00:55:43] <jacta> iSeeDeadPixels, but why :)
[00:56:02] <TheBrayn> I tried debugging it but I didn't see any errors there

[01:21:13] <bharath> I want to send a get request asynchronously when the user leaves the web page , by using $(window).bind("beforeunload") , I cannot able to acheive my goal because the web page is closes before the GET request is sent
[01:21:13] <bharath> can anyone help me with this issue?
[01:40:04] <shoky> bharath: you cant do it as far as i know. only thing you can do is: $(window).bind('beforeunload', function() { return "PLEASE STAY I AM NOT DONE WITH YOUR AJAX" });
[01:40:55] <bharath> shoky,:-)
[01:40:55] <bharath> shoky , I got the solution
[01:42:43] <bharath> shoky, while using $.ajax() we must use aync:false , it will work
[01:43:04] <shoky> hehe
[01:43:09] <shoky> ok ;)

[02:07:00] <n4n00> hey channel. anyone in a helping mood today?
[02:08:05] <atan2> <a></a><i></i> I might use next() but if the <i> is inside the <a>, how do I select it?
[02:08:56] <atan2> Hmm... okay children() works. Sweet. That's what I get for being up too late. Thanks anyway guys :-)
[02:09:51] <n4n00> im creating my own gallery and was wondering if there is a way of getting any image to fit in a fixed width container but still be in the right ratio for the height?
[02:16:12] <faraway> n4n00: you need to do your own math there
[02:17:41] <SP33D> Hello little question i need to replace in dom ready document a part of a link i can't find a method to search and replace /tumbnail_img/ with /info_img/
[02:18:01] <SP33D> only methods i found do complet replacement of tags and attributes
[02:18:20] <SP33D> but i need to edit a href attrib of a <a> tag
[02:18:36] <SP33D> and not replace the complet tag
[02:18:58] <salaet> hello!
[02:19:03] <SP33D> hello
[02:19:21] <AdamPDotty> $('a[href=thumbnail_img]')attr('href', 'info_img)
[02:19:25] <salaet> i'm confused I'm using this $(document).ready( function() { and my inside functions only execute one time
[02:19:51] <salaet> I'm doing a click event that toggle on to off and off to on
[02:19:54] <SP33D> thx a lot
[02:19:58] <AdamPDotty> have a look at the attribute selector for details
[02:20:13] <salaet> AdamPdotty: is to me?
[02:20:25] <AdamPDotty> salaet: the page only loads once
[02:20:43] <salaet> yes
[02:20:49] <faraway> n4n00: check if the width or height of the image is greater then the limit of the area, if yes calculate the ratio e.g. width/heigh ... chekc if the width is bigger, if yes use the width of the area and calcualte the new height. then check if the height is bigger then the area use the height of the area and calcualte the new width
[02:21:01] <AdamPDotty> i.e. the document is only ready(ing) once
[02:21:22] <salaet> who is the best way to doing this
[02:21:27] <AdamPDotty> me
[02:21:39] <AdamPDotty> and define "this"
[02:21:40] <faraway> AdamPDotty: ^^
[02:21:59] <salaet> how?
[02:22:16] <salaet> any link with example?
[02:22:20] <faraway> salaet: what do you expect that ready should do ?
[02:22:32] <salaet> switch class
[02:23:33] <salaet> I have two functions one for one class and other for the other class, inside this functions I'm passing data (ajax) to server and if the response is true I want to change the class, but only perfonce one time
[02:25:20] <jacta> AdamPDotty, did you get my last message?
[02:25:37] <SP33D> hm don't works like its needed
[02:26:14] <jowls> hi, looking for a slider/carousel there are a lot out there! can someone recommend one please? my requirements are: Supports html, not just images, free, simple (not interested in fancy transitions)
[02:26:28] <SP33D> other question is there a way to search and replace for a exactly defined html snippet and only replace the snippet?
[02:28:05] <salaet> faraway: is only switching class
[02:28:17] <salaet> but only execute once
[02:28:36] <faraway> salaet: and why do you think that the callback you pass to the ready function should be called more then once ? (it is only called once when the dom created form the loaded page is ready)
[02:31:07] <salaet> faraway: this example runs but I only wants that change the name of the class inside div and the javascript idetify the new class http://www.devirtuoso.com/2011/05/toggle-switches-with-jquery-and-checkboxes/
[02:33:45] <benjick> !rules
[02:35:03] <benjick> Hey. I'm looking for jquery plugin, sort of like an infinite carousel. I've made this quick in paint to illustrate what I'm looking for. http://i.imgur.com/Ol18n.png There is also a live one at http://www.arper.com/en . I've googled this but yet to find one that fills my needs. Any suggestions?
[02:35:33] <SP33D> can some one boost me with a example for the following situation : There is <a class="Preview" href="http://bla.com/tumbnail_img/some.jpg> i need to change it to <a class="Preview" href="http://bla.com/info_img/some.jpg> so only edit the part in the href attrib of the a tag
[02:35:42] <faraway> salaet: sorry .. make small sample in jsfiddle.net with the code you think that should work, and write comments what the code should do. otherwise i really can't imagine what you want and what your problem is
[02:36:08] <salaet> faraway: thanks!
[02:36:49] <faraway> SP33D: well you could use regex to achive this
[02:36:58] <SP33D> sounds good
[02:37:13] <SP33D> like the php regex i think
[02:37:17] <faraway> SP33D: get the attr src, and then replace tumbnail_img with info_img
[02:37:40] <faraway> SP33D: there are some limitations in js but if you know php regex then it should me no problem
[02:37:50] <faraway> SP33D: *be
[02:42:39] <AdamPDotty> then how bout that: $.each('a[href*="thumbnail_img"]', function(index, element){element.href= element.href.replace('thumbnail_img', 'info_img';)});
[02:43:34] <SP33D> Adm looks more clear then my regex trys
[02:43:34] <SP33D> :D
[02:43:37] <SP33D> ill try it
[02:47:28] <Kambfhase> $('a[href*="thumbnail_img"]').attr('href',function( i, oldValue){ return oldValue.replace('thumbnail_img','info_img); }) << nicer
[02:47:30] <faraway> SP33D: well replace uses a regular expression. but passing a string as first parameter does automatic regex escape of the string
[02:51:59] <asteriodz> hey
[02:53:51] <AdamPDotty> regex would be s/thumbnail_img/info_img/
[02:54:35] <helllen> helllo
[02:54:46] <helllen> I would ike to use ajaxn function
[02:54:59] <helllen> the url is url:/events
[02:55:10] <helllen> the problem is I would like the javascript
[02:55:26] <helllen> how could I get javascript response instead of html ?
[02:56:03] <salaet> faraway: I solved! thanks!
[02:56:07] <Kambfhase> ?getScript @ helllen
[02:56:33] <Kambfhase> bot-t? NOOOOOO
[02:56:40] <Kambfhase> Why did you leave me?

[03:06:25] <iSeeDeadPixels> :)
[03:13:17] <kruszczyk> OK I have a new question for you guys: how do I bind an image loaded event to an <img>
[03:13:39] <kruszczyk> I've tried $(img).bind("unload", function(){blah blah})
[03:19:30] <faraway> kruszczyk: i always us this http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/mzB4z/
[03:20:36] <faraway> kruszczyk: btw unload is for page unload ... the correct event is "load"
[03:20:57] <faraway> kruszczyk: then it it should work with the $(img).on("load", .... );
[03:21:12] <kruszczyk> faraway: it's a typo, I meant to type 'onload
[03:21:29] <kruszczyk> I'll try those and get back to you, thanks for the tips
[03:21:30] <faraway> kruszczyk: you don't use the on prefix when registering events in jquery
[03:21:39] <thanpolas> can someone help me with Deferred.rejectWith() typeError i get? Check this fiddle please: http://jsfiddle.net/thanpolas/rgeCv/
[03:22:09] <faraway> kruszczyk: but check the http://api.jquery.com/load-event/  there the problems with the load event are described thats why i use the function i told you
[03:22:49] <kruszczyk> faraway: that's the problem I have - the $(img).load(function(){}) doesn't work in Opera
[03:25:08] <seutje> load event on images is sorta problematic, as it doesn't fire for cached images and stuff
[03:25:16] <seutje> ?g imagesloaded @ kruszczyk
[03:25:18] <bot-t> kruszczyk, desandro/imagesloaded · GitHub - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[03:28:29] <seutje> thanpolas: docs say the optional arguments have to be a single array
[03:28:47] <seutje> thanpolas: -> http://jsfiddle.net/rgeCv/1/
[03:29:16] <thanpolas> oh ic… thank you seutje
[03:29:31] <thanpolas> (it is kind of lame)
[03:34:29] <kruszczyk> seutje: looks nice, I'm checking it out!
[03:34:36] <itatitat> guys Ive problems with the scope. Ive two files js, everything inside is wrapped by document ready, they have functions inside, but later, in when they run they dont find some functions
[03:41:33] <itatitat> guys I get the message "some script could be bussy", is a prompt, can I fix that wrapping in document ready?
[03:42:07] <tlkr> You could have an infinite loop
[03:42:58] <itatitat> really?............jummmmmmmmmm, ok
[03:43:53] <faraway> itatitat: do you have such a situation? http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/DrAvu/1/
[03:44:12] <itatitat> having a look
[03:44:46] <itatitat> similar, really I fixed that, was the document ready, finally I got out some functions from document ready, I make them general
[03:44:59] <itatitat> but wow....very helpful
[03:45:38] <faraway> itatitat: the functions are limited to the scope of the function they are defined in
[03:46:06] <itatitat> yes, but I was confuse because I use document ready, in two different files, really is the first time I have that situation
[03:47:38] <faraway> itatitat: you can always make namespace to prevent name conflicts http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/DrAvu/3/
[03:48:58] <Gx4> hi
[04:18:37] <Kambfhase> bot-t: hi!
[04:18:42] <bot-t> Kambfhase, #3487 (Hi,I find a little bug) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 3 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3487
[04:18:52] <Kambfhase> m(
[04:18:54] <iSeeDeadPixels> XD
[04:24:39] <fALSO> hi
[04:24:52] <fALSO> should this selector work
[04:24:56] <fALSO> $("[name=pub["+table_id+"][pontuacao]]")
[04:25:13] <fALSO> the name of the element is like name="pub[0][pontuacao]"
[04:25:37] <Qdest> Anyone able to take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/JE5rg/ ? Inside the shadowMovement function I'm trying to set the opacity of the shadow only once, but I do not know how. The idea is to fade in the shadow once and adjust it on mousemovement.
[04:31:54] <pangelovski> hi guys, anyone here have any experience with query post and csrf?
[04:32:11] <pangelovski> *jquery (damn autocorrect)
[04:33:00] <Kambfhase> fALSO: you have to put your name into double quotes!
[04:33:29] <Kambfhase> fALSO: $('[name="pub['+table_id+'][pontuacao]]"')
[04:37:00] <Kambfhase> Qdest: http://jsfiddle.net/JE5rg/1/
[04:37:57] <Qdest> Kambfhase: I'm getting "alreadySet" isn't defined
[04:38:31] <Kambfhase> oh, yeah, gotta quote that
[04:39:22] <Qdest> Kambfhase: Understood, however for some reason it flickers (takes too long to set) I guess. Any idea what to do about that?
[04:40:41] <Kambfhase> well, you first animate the opacity and then reset it via css()
[04:42:11] <Qdest> Kambfhase: How? Doesn't fadeTo animate the opacity? You mean I should add a reset after it has animated, and to what?
[04:43:29] <Kambfhase> No, what i mean is that within that `if` you fadeTo() and right after that you set the opacity via .css()
[04:43:39] <Kambfhase> obvisously thats no good
[04:45:31] <Qdest> Kambfhase: Oh, I see. Basically I just wanted to animate the shadow "on first mousemove" to give it a smooth init. How'd you change the CSS of the shadow in that shadowMovement() ?
[04:45:58] <Noriandir> hi. i'm trying to get a array from a php function. I'm using a post to pass the values to the php function, and php is doing a echo json_encode of the array. now, how to I read the array from jquery? (using jquery for the first time...)
[04:46:13] <Kambfhase> ok, thats gonna be a bit more difficult. let me try
[04:47:10] <Qdest> Kambfhase: Thanks a lot!
[04:47:47] <anli> If I use div.dialog, how do I keep the events in div?
[04:47:54] <faraway> Noriandir: well you request the data with getJSON or ajax right ?
[04:47:57] <anli> So they will be used in the dialog
[04:48:19] <anli> Or will they be used?
[04:49:22] <Noriandir> faraway, with a post. like the second to last example: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[04:50:47] <faraway> Noriandir: well the first parameter of your success callback is data ... if you log this in your console, does this log you the string or an array/object
[04:51:37] <Kambfhase> Qdest: i guess, this is how you want it: http://jsfiddle.net/JE5rg/2/
[04:58:34] <Noriandir> faraway, not sure what you meant... you want me to check if data (the returned value) is a string or an array?
[04:58:51] <faraway> Noriandir: yes
[05:00:45] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/qjVHM/7/ <-- can someone help me out with this... somewhere in selected it seems its not removing and assigning new selected option...
[05:01:34] <AdvoWork> I've got: <select name="choice" id="choice"><option id="1078" value="1078" data-width="10" data-height="10">test</option> and am doing: var data_width = $('#choice option:selected', this).attr('data-width');  but it just crashes/memory leaks. Any idea whats up with it?
[05:01:52] <BMCouto> Hi, I would like some advice is I should prefer window.function to $.fn.? In which situations and why?
[05:02:02] <BMCouto> Hi, I would like some advice if I should prefer window.function to $.fn.? In which situations and why?
[05:02:52] <Kambfhase> windows.function? what is that?
[05:03:43] <goldstar> can i use $.get to retrieve a page on a different domain ?
[05:04:11] <Kambfhase> goldstar: no, for cross-domain you need to use JSONP
[05:04:14] <Noriandir> faraway, right now i'm getting null from php... =/
[05:05:00] <goldstar> Kambfhase: so $.getJson() would do the trick ?
[05:05:28] <Noriandir> faraway, php code: http://pastie.org/5029286
[05:05:32] <faraway> Noriandir: does it look like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/3WsjM/
[05:05:56] <BMCouto> Kambfhase:  window.myFunction = function()
[05:06:19] <Krambfhase> mkay
[05:06:30] <faraway> Noriandir: well i don't debug your php code ;) i assumed that your php code is returning a jason string
[05:06:39] <Qdest> Krambfhase: Exactly! Thanks a lot :)
[05:06:52] <Krambfhase> BMCouto: $.fn is for plugins
[05:07:01] <Krambfhase> Qdest: :)
[05:07:34] <Noriandir> faraway, so did I. json_encode should do that, right?
[05:08:21] <faraway> Noriandir: json_encode returns a json string thats correct
[05:09:05] <Tram> good afternoon all, I have a problem using the jquery each function. Iam using it to each over an array, however what it returns is kinda strange. It returns the object with a string for each letter. Can anyone help me? http://jsfiddle.net/MartvanKoolwijk/6rjFS/1/
[05:10:06] <Krambfhase> Tram: ha, thats an edgecase
[05:10:15] <BMCouto> Krambfhase: yeah but you can use it for all situations, my question is what area the advantages/disadvantages?
[05:10:51] <Noriandir> faraway, let me check the php code better...
[05:11:28] <Tram> Krambfhase: What do you mean with that? Is it unpossible?
[05:11:32] <ben_> how to get $.ajax to reurn a string that i can parse myself
[05:11:37] <Krambfhase> Tram: `this` is always an object, so in your case the string will be converted into a stringy object.
[05:12:07] <Tram> so i must use the index nr to target the place in the object?
[05:12:18] <Krambfhase> Tram: instead of `this` use arguments: http://jsfiddle.net/6rjFS/2/
[05:12:50] <AdvoWork> how can I get the data-attribute of a selected option? ive tried: var data_width = $(':selected', document.getElementById('choice')).data("width");  but keep getting null
[05:13:52] <Tram> Krambfhase: thanks mate!
[05:14:07] <Krambfhase> BMCouto: I'd not put a function onto $.fn if it didnt belong there.
[05:14:10] <Krambfhase> :)
[05:15:45] <ohcibi> is it possible to avoid autohiding of the tooltips from jquery uis tooltip?
[05:18:23] <BMCouto> Krambfhase:  once again, my question is, how to decide if it belongs there or not?
[05:19:04] <Krambfhase> if want you function to have access to the jQ-collection via `this`put it on $.fn
[05:19:32] <Krambfhase> $.fn is the prototype of each jQ-Collection
[05:24:58] <mazzachre> When I look on the interweb I find 2 ways of writing plugins: $.extend({myFunction() {...}); and $.myFunction = function() {...}; (And yes, I am talking about a utility function, not an element method) which one is prefered?
[05:26:21] <Krambfhase> that first version is a syntax error.
[05:26:48] <AdvoWork> I'm doing var data_height = $('#cutterchoice option:selected').data('height'); which works(my page has a default selected option) but if I change it, it doesn't pick up the new change, it is still trying to get the original set/selected option. Any ideas?
[05:26:52] <mazzachre> Yes, there is a } missing... anyway
[05:27:34] <mazzachre> Oh... {myFunction: funtion() {}}
[05:27:43] <mazzachre> Anyway, should I use extend or not?!
[05:28:14] <Krambfhase> mazzachre: well, one method extends $ will multiple methods, the other just adds one.
[05:28:53] <mazzachre> Krambfhase: Yes, I know I can extend with multiple methods, but I am only going to add one...
[05:29:16] <Krambfhase> then jst do $.method = function(){}
[05:29:22] <mazzachre> ok, thx
[05:30:57] <anli> Is .dialog cloning the div its applied on?
[05:31:21] <Cork> no
[05:31:37] <Cork> it moves it though
[05:39:29] <mazzachre> Can I test if document.ready have already been run? Without setting something myself?
[05:39:45] <accesscode> http://jsfiddle.net/qjVHM/7/ <-- can someone help me out with this... somewhere in selected it seems its not removing and assigning new selected option...
[05:42:21] <Krambfhase> accesscode: click() is not change() ;)
[05:42:44] <Krambfhase> ahh, forget that
[05:43:02] <AdvoWork> I'm doing var data_height = $('#cutterchoice option:selected').data('height'); which works(my page has a default selected option) but if I change it, it doesn't pick up the new change, it is still trying to get the original set/selected option. Any ideas?
[05:43:50] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: If you described something meaningful you might get an asnwer...
[05:44:30] <Krambfhase> mazzachre: try jQuery.isReady
[05:45:14] <Krambfhase> AdvoWork: .data() only gets the width from the lement alsong as jQ-cache does not have a value for that.
[05:45:14] <AdvoWork> mazzachre, well, i have a select menu, by default it loads with one of its options selected(as its dynamic). i run my jquery, it shows data attributes as null(because they are on the selected), if i pick another item(which has the data attributes) it still says its null, even though I can see them
[05:45:20] <Krambfhase> ie. it can only read once
[05:45:35] <AdvoWork> Krambfhase, how can i get it then, as it differs per option
[05:45:42] <Krambfhase> did you try .prop("data-width") ?
[05:46:30] <accesscode> kramb: im not changing anything... i need to click to change.
[05:46:57] <Krambfhase> yeah, sorry bout that
[05:47:24] <accesscode> though yes, click is not change :D
[05:49:31] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: .data() is not dynamic, are you trying to read something like .val()??
[05:49:40] <Krambfhase> accesscode: trouble is, you code is kinda long, with meaningless numbers, no comments, and I dont know, how its supposed to behave
[05:50:41] <accesscode> numbers are random, generated from a CMS
[05:51:27] <accesscode> though not so random, its actually generated by cms, they are ID's
[05:52:22] <AdvoWork> mazzachre, i need to get the actual data attributes for whatever i select, each select option is different, but it is always reading the initially selected one
[05:53:09] <AdvoWork> Krambfhase, i tried: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'prop'
[05:53:26] <Krambfhase> AdvoWork: which version are you on?
[05:53:30] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: As I said... .data() is a jQuery construct and have nothing to do with select boxes et al... So whatever you get with .data() is whatever you set with .data()
[05:53:54] <Krambfhase> accesscode: the problem is, that is just a blob of code to me. What is supposed to happen when I click + ?
[05:56:27] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: To get the value of a select, input or textarea use .val() function
[05:57:09] <accesscode> http://jsfiddle.net/qjVHM/8/ <-- there... with comments..
[05:57:46] <Kambfhase> mazzachre: thats like not his problem at all
[05:58:38] <accesscode> + means to use the next option after selected,  while - means to use next option before selected
[05:59:02] <mazzachre> Kambfhase: OK, then he is just not describing his problem well
[05:59:04] <AdvoWork> mazzachre, yeah but its not displaying what i set with data, ie: ive got <option id="1070" name="1070" value="1070" selected="">original</option> <option id="1082" value="1082" data-width="1" data-height="1">test</option>  so say i click on the 2nd one(test) and move away from it, it still gives null(from the first one)
[05:59:12] <accesscode> its like jquery.ui.spinner <-- though this broke my entire page so i have to recreate similar..
[05:59:38] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: Ah... now I know it... .data() have nothing to do with html5 data attributes aither
[06:00:02] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: Unless of cause you are using jqueymobile?
[06:01:43] <AdvoWork> mazzachre, nope not using mobile, any idea how I can get these values then?
[06:03:16] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: 2 ways generally... 1: where you generate your html, instead of setting data-height="1" you instead make a map of "ID:HEIGHT" and then in your script set it as array and fun foreach with the values $('#'+id).data(height)...
[06:03:31] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: The other way is to use $(this).attr('data-height')
[06:04:29] <mazzachre> The second way is cleaner in code and unless you need heavy convertion also quicker...
[06:05:31] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: And I will give you that it is not intuitive that jQuery does not utilize the std. html5 data structuresm but fact is jQuery was first :p
[06:05:36] <greek> Hey fellas. I'm using ("#mydiv").load("foo.html", function() {$("#mydiv").tabs(); }) but for some reason my tabs aren't being initialised
[06:05:51] <greek> The content of the loaded HTML is valid for tabs.
[06:07:19] <AdvoWork> mazzachre, but i can't use $(this) if another element is calling the function can i?
[06:07:32] <seutje> ?proxy @ AdvoWork
[06:07:33] <bot-t> AdvoWork, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[06:08:04] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: Do not call functions on other elements! Either use the proxy or better yet, assign custom events and triggers
[06:08:29] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: Calling functions like that is bound to give you grey hair way before time :D
[06:12:44] <AdvoWork> mazzachre, the thing is, this is a check that should be done each time an element is filled in, so it needs to fire from all elements on the page
[06:14:22] <Anticom2> hi all
[06:15:30] <accesscode> http://jsfiddle.net/qjVHM/8/ <-- Any help please...
[06:16:34] <Trisox> love my work working with models and prived strings :D
[06:16:45] <Trisox> *private
[06:17:42] <docmur> When I trigger a hide() the entire page refreshes,  Is there a way to stop that from happening?
[06:18:14] <TheBrayn> that's not the hide which is causing this
[06:19:58] <docmur> Is there any jquery call which might trigger a page refresh, it only seems to happen when I call hide after clicking a button
[06:20:11] <Siver> I'm having no luck with changing the values of hidden form inputs through jquery ... is there any consistent way to achieve this?
[06:20:18] <tlkr> docmur, is the trigger fired by a <a> or submit or something?
[06:20:32] <docmur> yes by a button type="submit"
[06:20:33] <Siver> I mean, I can select the input, but when I chain .val(myVal) to it, it just won't budge
[06:20:47] <Saaether> clicking the button is most likely what is causing the refresh
[06:21:01] <tlkr> docmur, you need to prevent the default action on the submit
[06:21:12] <docmur> oh okay, good to know :-)
[06:21:13] <mazzachre> Can this be done better? http://jsfiddle.net/yy8WZ/2/ The functionality of it that is :) As in, I want these scripts to be run after a global ready() function have been called (no matter when they are parsed)
[06:22:16] <tlkr> silverwind, you are chaining .val()'s? I'm slightly confused, can you jsfiddle an example?
[06:22:39] <mazzachre> AdvoWork: Best guess is you are doing something very wrong... Any time you have to make javascript do something to every element in the dom chances are you are doing something that is very wrong... You probably need to rethink this in web aspect, it sounds like you are stuck in desktop askpect somehow
[06:24:48] <Siver> tlkr: did you tab to the wrong person ... getting the feeling this is a question for me?
[06:25:19] <tlkr> yes Siver :-(
[06:30:46] <Anticom2> is there any way to get relative width of an element defined by css? http://jsfiddle.net/86zQM/
[06:34:25] <Siver> tlkr: http://jsfiddle.net/Fdnvf/
[06:34:30] <Siver> tried to slim it down
[06:35:54] <Siver> Basically what I am trying to do is cloning a form template, and setting an ID that I need to use to post my form later on
[06:36:15] <Siver> but for some reason my hidden field just won't accept a new value
[06:36:33] <hlve> sup cuties
[06:37:27] <seutje> accesscode: http://jsfiddle.net/qjVHM/9/ like that?
[06:39:00] <tlkr> Siver, #hidden-recordid is not a direct child of .noregister-contact-template, which is why it's not working.
[06:39:21] <tlkr> You need to use .find or .children('form').children('#hidden-recordid')
[06:39:23] <Siver> tlkr: I tried find too
[06:39:42] <ryanneufeld> seutje: http://jqueryui.com/spinner/
[06:40:29] <docmur> Okay so I now have the form's submit overridden but now I need to trigger the hide off the cancel button http://jsfiddle.net/eXbsj/27/
[06:40:30] <greek> Hey fellas, any idea why this selector works: $("a[href$='add']").click(function() {... but this one doesn't: $("div#tabs").on("click", "a[href$='add']", function() {... ? I've triple-checked and that link is definitely inside div#tabs. Thanks
[06:41:00] <Siver> well, apparently it is working in jsfiddle, so I guess I made an oopsy somewhere in my own code since this is the slimmed down version
[06:41:04] <hlve> greek: http://jsfiddle.net Mock up an example
[06:44:21] <seutje> ryanneufeld: jquery ui is kinda big if u just want this
[06:44:43] <pangelovski> hi guys anyone that has experience with ajax csrf?
[06:44:54] <ryanneufeld> seutje: http://jqueryui.com/download/
[06:45:09] <ryanneufeld> seutje: you can customize the download to just what you need.
[06:45:18] <ryanneufeld> pangelovski: see ?ajax
[06:45:19] <bot-t> pangelovski, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:45:38] <ryanneufeld> pangelovski: also it depends on what you're using for a back end
[06:46:06] <ryanneufeld> pangelovski: you'll want to check with the support/forums/community for that system
[06:46:18] <pangelovski> ryanneufeld: I'm using code igniter, however most of the examples are specific for php pages, since I'm using phone gap, i cannot use php
[06:46:44] <ryanneufeld> pangelovski: are you using phonegap, or code igniter?
[06:46:47] <seutje> ryanneufeld: I know, still 34KB with just spinner
[06:46:48] <Frantic> guys, can someone recommend a popover plugin that can open a popover next to an element, and let me pick the side it opens on?
[06:46:58] <pangelovski> client: phone gap +jquery, server:codeigniter
[06:47:18] <pangelovski> ryanneufeld:
[06:47:39] <ryanneufeld> pangelovski: then unless you use codeigniter to generate your forms, the only option I can see is to disable the CSRF on CI
[06:48:06] <seutje> ryanneufeld: then again, his solution was kinda huge as well :P
[06:48:34] <ryanneufeld> seutje: and jqueryui is pretty cool

[07:18:08] <ryanneufeld> oh, did you minify that by hand?
[07:18:18] <seutje> boulet101010_: if u don't have to support IE<9, I guess
[07:18:31] <boulet101010_> =]]
[07:18:35] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: relative width?
[07:18:40] <ryanneufeld> invisib: did you minify that by hand? or did you use a tool?
[07:19:02] <boulet101010_> so addEvent become attachEvent if ie<9 ? then it's compatible?
[07:19:38] <invisib> It's not mine
[07:20:05] <ryanneufeld> ah
[07:20:06] <invisib> Just the final product of combining tiny localscroll plugin with regex implementation, for 298 character localscroll

[07:20:17] <invisib> http://pastie.org/5029776
[07:20:34] <seutje> boulet101010_: but if you don't have to support IE<8, you might as well use qSA

[07:20:53] <seutje> boulet101010_: as this implementation is rather tightly coupled with the markup
[07:20:54] <invisib> There's the full implementation. Click on a link in dropdown menu and it will localscroll to that section. Can have as many links as you want. 298 chars total. Beats the brakes off Ariel Fleischers localscroll implementation everyone uses.
[07:20:55] <boulet101010_> ofc ^_^

[07:21:34] <invisib> Sweet! Obama meme'd! Approval acquired! Thanks dad!
[07:21:44] <invisib> Off to smoke and then break something else.
[07:21:48] <invisib> Thanks again ryan
[07:22:08] <Anticom2> johnkpaul http://jsfiddle.net/86zQM/3/
[07:22:28] <Anticom2> this is my point... i want to actually know, what exactly the css said
[07:23:12] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: oh I see what you mean
[07:23:21] <johnkpaul> what you are looking for is possible, but very complicated
[07:23:29] <reloadz> thx
[07:23:34] <johnkpaul> I suggest trying to find a different way to accomplish your end goal
[07:23:46] <Anticom2> johnkpaul e.g.?
[07:24:17] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: I don't actually know, what is your end goal here? why do you need to tell the difference between the units that a css rule is specified in
[07:25:09] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/CSSStyleDeclaration
[07:25:18] <Anticom2> johnkpaul i'm writing a jq plugin generating hidable menus. so i need to store the original width so if i collapse i can set the width to zero and when expanding it again the original width should be restored
[07:25:39] <Anticom2> so if i resize the window the menu shows the same behaviour as before
[07:26:54] <Anticom2> thank's johnkpaul but unfortunately this isn't cross-browser compatible :/ (have to support IE 6 *puke*)
[07:27:38] <seutje> :o
[07:27:42] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: then I believe your only option is http://www.glazman.org/JSCSSP/
[07:27:49] <johnkpaul> but tbh, I dont' see why you can't use px width
[07:27:50] <seutje> my condolences
[07:28:30] <johnkpaul> seutje: moment of silence starts right now
[07:28:45] * seutje walks out for a smoke
[07:29:05] <Anticom2> gl, hf
[07:29:06] <johnkpaul> damn it seutje, everyone heard that
[07:29:44] <Anticom2> johnkpaul looks promising. is the parsed css stored in the DOM anywhere so i don't have to request external stylesheeets again from the server using ajax?
[07:30:03] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: in all browsers down to IE6? I don't think so
[07:30:09] <johnkpaul> you should research further though
[07:30:31] <Anticom2> johnkpaul why don't use px? well plugins are meant to be reusable and work under all circumstances
[07:30:36] <curfont> anyone know an OSS version of http://editor.datatables.net/ ?
[07:30:43] <NoiseEee> also, http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Totally_Pwn_CSS_with_Javascript @ Anticom2
[07:30:57] <curfont> I am looking for a popup form kind of thing
[07:30:58] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: I don't see how using pixels removes that ability
[07:31:16] <johnkpaul> I don't think that plugins that mess with dom/css maintain that
[07:31:26] <johnkpaul> for example, jcarousel, I'm pretty sure just position absolutes everything
[07:31:35] <Gx4> how to select div element attribute? $(".classOne")[0].attr("value") returns object has no method attr
[07:31:40] <Anticom2> johnkpaul because if a menu is meant to scale relative to parents/documents width using px would destroy that behaviour
[07:32:05] <_dc> hey all...is it possible to include an object when using getScript? ie <script src="foo.js">{bar: 'foobar'}</script>
[07:32:22] <johnkpaul> curfont: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/02/unleash-the-grid/ there's a list there
[07:32:37] <johnkpaul> Gx4: .eq(0)
[07:32:39] <johnkpaul> not [0]
[07:32:53] <NexHD> can someone help me please with this little script?  http://jsfiddle.net/bJGjw/
[07:33:02] <johnkpaul> _dc: no, if there is an src attribute, the contents of the element isn't interpreted AFAIK
[07:33:03] <Gx4> johnkpaul thx
[07:33:23] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: if it's supposed to be responsive, then just compute the percentages at the begining
[07:33:27] <johnkpaul> and always use percentages
[07:33:35] <johnkpaul> I am confused about why you need to switch
[07:33:36] <_dc> johnkpaul: it is if you're inlining it like that
[07:34:00] <johnkpaul> _dc: ok, even if that's the case, just having an object there wouldnt do anything
[07:34:03] <johnkpaul> it's a noop
[07:34:11] <johnkpaul> ?eval {bar:"foobar"}
[07:34:15] <bot-t> johnkpaul: "foobar"
[07:34:15] <Anticom2> johnkpaul see this: http://jsfiddle.net/86zQM/3/ ...point is that the plugin should detect how the element is styled exactly
[07:34:37] <Anticom2> so if it's css width rule is 20% i want to get 20%, if it's 50px i want to get 50px
[07:34:40] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: yes, I understand what you're trying to do, I am questioning why you need to do it
[07:34:44] <ekinox001> how to apply jquery function on ajax generated items?
[07:34:48] <_dc> wondering if possible when loading asynchronously
[07:35:08] <johnkpaul> _dc: ah, I see, I don't know, but I would try to stay away from something like that
[07:35:11] <fALSO> how can i access a JSON response
[07:35:12] <krismeld> does anyone know if its possible to show content like a gallery in fullscreen with jquery, where the whole screen is used, like when you watch videos in fullscreen on youtube?
[07:35:20] <fALSO> like getting the value of 'min'
[07:35:25] <fALSO> json.min ? should work ?
[07:35:27] <Anticom2> because applying the plugin to an element literally is as simple as doing "$('#nav1').shNav1();" and i don't want to configure a whole lot
[07:35:28] <johnkpaul> _dc: why do you want to add code inside that script Tag
[07:35:32] <_dc> I would too johnkpaul...api requires it though :(
[07:35:40] <johnkpaul> _dc: what api?
[07:35:42] <Anticom2> johnkpaul in short plugins are meant to be smart
[07:35:43] <_dc> they put their config setting in there
[07:36:13] <krismeld> i have to make a gallery presentation for a museum, that is to played on touch screens
[07:36:20] <krismeld> be
[07:36:22] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: so you mean that the plugin end users will expect that you use pixels in some sitatuions and percentages in others?
[07:36:26] <_dc> it's a closed api we're using...but I've seen it with gigya also johnkpaul
[07:36:33] <johnkpaul> gigya?
[07:36:56] <johnkpaul> krismeld: look into screenful.js
[07:37:11] <_dc> johnkpaul: http://developers.gigya.com/010_Developer_Guide/84_Using_the_Client_API/20_Getting_Started
[07:37:22] <_dc> that example code, line 6
[07:38:01] <johnkpaul> _dc: that's being queried and evaled
[07:38:04] <fALSO> how can i acces item by item on a json response ?
[07:38:05] <johnkpaul> by the script itself
[07:38:08] <Anticom2> johnkpaul depending on what the user chose to use in their stylesheet
[07:38:34] <johnkpaul> _dc: the browser isn't doing that for them
[07:39:03] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: what I'm saying is that as a plugin end user, I don't think that I would expect the functionality that you want to provide, let alone _require_ it for my u sae
[07:39:04] <johnkpaul> usage*
[07:39:18] <seutje> parsing stylesheets is such a bitch
[07:39:22] <johnkpaul> it's definitely a good goal, if it were easy, I'd say go for it, but including an entire gigantic css parser in your js
[07:39:25] <johnkpaul> just for this one feature
[07:39:25] <axscode> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12822022/jquery-select-input-change-option-selected-when-clicking-button-up-or-down
[07:39:27] <johnkpaul> isn't worth it to me
[07:39:52] <Anticom2> johnkpaul yeah, that's why i'm asking if there's any way to get it out of the dom in at least most browsers
[07:39:55] <_dc> any way to pass that to the script so that they can query it the same way johnkpaul?
[07:40:06] <krismeld> johnkpauk thanks a lot! it seems that the menubar show up when the mouse is at the top of the screen though. i need something that the user cannot exit with the mouse, maybe it cant be done in a browser..?
[07:40:06] <_dc> using getScript
[07:40:07] <johnkpaul> _dc: "they"?
[07:40:21] <_dc> the script
[07:40:41] <johnkpaul> oh I see what you mean _dc, no, there is not a way to do that, your gigya example has explicit knowledge in the code, to look up for that script tag
[07:40:47] <johnkpaul> you can take a look at it, just put it rhough a beatufier
[07:41:01] <_dc> i gotcha
[07:41:05] <_dc> thanks!
[07:41:07] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: sure, there's the first example that I sent you from mdn
[07:41:11] <johnkpaul> _dc: no problem! have fun
[07:41:30] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: but no IE7-
[07:41:33] <Anticom2> johnkpaul so with which browsers is it compatible?
[07:41:39] <coppa> hi there for once I got a question : how could I do in a functon to return only when i finish an animation inside the function (fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/qvBpy/ )
[07:41:41] <Anticom2> hm okay
[07:42:04] <johnkpaul> coppa: you can't sadly, that's just not how javascript work
[07:42:05] <johnkpaul> works*
[07:42:23] <coppa> Okay thanks
[07:42:23] <johnkpaul> but, if you return the animation, you can add a callback to it
[07:42:41] <coppa> yep but then the return would be for the callback not the function..
[07:42:46] <johnkpaul> coppa: http://jsfiddle.net/qvBpy/1/
[07:43:00] <johnkpaul> yes, coppa, you can't block until the animation is over, it is asynchronous
[07:43:25] <mrHat> ok, so im using $.post to post some data to a php script returning some json encoded data. The data returned is in format : ["id0","id1","id2","id3"]  then i try to iteraye trough that using : $.each(data, function() { alert(this); });   but it's not working.. it's just outputting each charater in the returned json. what am i doing wrong ?
[07:43:29] <coppa> okay thanks I gonna do this in a different way then :)
[07:43:37] <coppa> thx johnkpaul
[07:43:50] <johnkpaul> coppa: no problem
[07:43:52] <johnkpaul> have fun
[07:44:20] <johnkpaul> mrHat: is your server side script returning the correct content type?
[07:44:23] <johnkpaul> it should be application/json
[07:44:29] <Anticom2> johnkpaul um... could you fiddle a small example please?
[07:44:30] <johnkpaul> either that, or specifiy the dataType conf option
[07:44:45] <johnkpaul> mrHat: dataType:'json'
[07:45:02] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: there is an example in that MDN page, no?
[07:45:15] <Anticom2> touchÃ©
[07:45:17] <Anticom2> :D
[07:45:30] <Anticom2> netsplit?!
[07:45:35] <Anticom2> urgh
[07:45:42] <mrHat> johnkpaul isnt that done automatically ?
[07:45:43] <Anticom2> omg they're using alert in their example :/
[07:45:53] <NodeX> anyone know off the top of their head if jquery has support for "orientationchange"
[07:46:00] <johnkpaul> mrHat: it is if the server is sending the correct mime type
[07:46:15] <johnkpaul> NodeX: I don't think it does
[07:46:39] <johnkpaul> mrHat: the browser can't assume the content type isn't what the server sends back
[07:46:44] <johnkpaul> chances are your server is sending text/plain
[07:46:47] <johnkpaul> or text/html
[07:46:55] <johnkpaul> unless you override that somehow, how can jquery know what to do with it
[07:47:21] <NodeX> dang
[07:47:27] <NodeX> ok thanks
[07:51:03] <mrHat> how exactly do i specify datatype in a $.post function
[07:51:33] <mrHat> i have rigjt now : $.post("devolucion.php", {facturaID: facturaID, jsonarr: JSON.stringify(checkboxesArr)}, function(data){ // });
[07:52:03] <johnkpaul> mrHat: add another parameter 'json'
[07:52:14] <johnkpaul> the last parameter to $.post is the data type
[07:52:43] <mrHat> ahh yes
[07:52:49] <mrHat> after the success function
[07:52:54] <johnkpaul> yeah
[07:52:57] <mrHat> tnx
[07:53:03] <johnkpaul> no problem
[07:53:25] <Anticom2> johnkpaul how do i find the rules applied to the node i'm currently looking at. in other words, are there any dom node references stored in those css rules?
[07:53:50] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: no
[07:53:54] <lalalala> hi
[07:53:54] <johnkpaul> you have to do the match yourself
[07:54:07] <lalalala> what's the event of selecting a radio button?
[07:54:28] <Anticom2> well then i can't make any use of it :/
[07:55:29] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: why not?
[07:55:40] <johnkpaul> you have the rules, you just have to search them yourself
[07:55:51] <johnkpaul> check out that link that NoiseEee sent you
[07:56:17] <tlkr> lalalala, would it not be change?
[07:56:17] <Anticom2> well i've got a dom reference in my jq object and i got a bunch of rules with some selector text. the only way to get the corresponding rules would be iterating over all css-selectors and match them against my dom reference
[07:56:23] <Anticom2> that doesn't sound very performant
[07:56:40] <docmur> Is there a way to toggle a varible with out using an if?  something like toggle = !toggle
[07:57:18] <johnkpaul> docmur: you got it, right here
[07:57:21] <johnkpaul> there*
[07:57:34] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: who said anything about performance? :)
[07:57:48] <Anticom2> trolljohn :D
[07:58:32] <lalalala> tlkr: so they say... it ain't working for me though
[07:58:34] <johnkpaul> Anticom2: :-) sorry, if I knew any other way, I'd tell you
[07:58:44] <johnkpaul> lalalala: use click
[07:59:00] <lalalala> tried that too
[07:59:20] <Anticom2> johnkpaul i know. i'm just so sad about there is none :(
[07:59:49] <johnkpaul> yeah
[07:59:50] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ lalalala
[07:59:51] <bot-t> lalalala, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:04:06] <lalalala> http://jsfiddle.net/v6fn6/2/
[08:04:09] <lalalala> strange
[08:04:13] <lalalala> here it works
[08:04:50] <johnkpaul> lalalala: :) then there has to be some other issues
[08:04:58] <johnkpaul> lalalala: try removing scripts from your page
[08:19:31] <Gx4> how do I get item like this : $(".class.checked").(id=One) ?
[08:20:04] <johnkpaul> ?Filter @Gx4
[08:20:05] <bot-t> Gx4, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[08:20:18] <Gx4> great
[08:20:22] <Gx4> thx
[08:20:24] <johnkpaul> np
[08:21:56] <dwieeb> Anyone know how I can cancel a jquery ui accordion event? when the checkboxes are clicked, I don't want the accordion to do anything: https://test-web01.oit.uwplatt.edu/map
[08:23:36] <SeanLazer> hey guys, i'm trying to load a script after the documentready happens, i have code that looks like this: https://gist.github.com/3866321
[08:23:50] <johnkpaul> dwieeb: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#event-beforeActivate
[08:23:54] <johnkpaul> you can cancel that event
[08:24:07] <SeanLazer> unfortunately just putting the script tag into the div doesn't fire it.  on the flip side, if i use document.write to write it in at page load it does fire it
[08:24:27] <SeanLazer> so is there a way to put a script tag with a source into an element and then tell it to it load that source?
[08:25:17] <Trisox> any one knows how to prevent the jquery validate to scroll to the top ? when submited?
[08:25:24] <Trisox> it drives me nuts
[08:25:33] <dwieeb> SeanLazer: I think you have to separate out the first <script like <scr' + 'ipt as well
[08:26:50] <SeanLazer> dwieeb: that didn't do it.  the network tab is showing that the call is made but nothing gets written into the div (the javascript that i'm calling itself i believe is just some document.writes
[08:28:02] <seutje> doc.write is pretty evil
[08:28:43] <dwieeb> johnkpaul: Are there any examples of this being used? Like would I pass in the click event of the checkbox? I don't know how to do that or where to start
[08:30:32] <SeanLazer> seutje: shitty banner ads are pretty evil but the job is teh job
[08:30:47] <seutje> oh yeah, been there
[08:31:03] <seutje> the best ad scripts fuck up your Array.prototype though
[08:31:13] <seutje> then you know you got urself a golden one
[08:33:43] <MagmaRules> Hi there, anyone knows if there is a free ui lib similar to mochaui for query ?
[08:37:28] <dontbecold_> Question, why does $(form).on('submit') clobber HTML5 validations?
[08:45:15] <dontbecold_> Never mind, I was running on 1.7.1, upgrading it to 1.8.2 seems to fix it
[08:46:33] <Anticom2> how do i unset css properties? .css('value', ''); doesn't seem to work according to firebug
[08:46:56] <seutje> .css('value', null) irc
[08:46:59] <seutje> iirc*
[08:47:15] <seutje> eerrr .css('property', null)
[08:48:38] <Anticom2> oh it does
[08:48:44] <Anticom2> '' works aswell
[08:48:53] <Anticom2> just applied it to wrong dom node ;)
[08:49:37] <Anticom2> johnkpaul btw that's solving my problem... i just wasn't aware, that removing an attribute unsetting it with .css() method causes the browser to apply the original styled width again ;)
[08:50:32] <dwieeb> johnkpaul: This worked for me http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[08:51:50] <mdeboard> Hi everyone. I've got a UI element that I want to either A. .slideUp(900) or B. .remove() if the user clicks on it. I'm using Underscore.js's _.delay method but I've found that it "blocks" so that the click event doesn't fire. Is there a better way of handling this? https://gist.github.com/25b0523c000a24afebd3 (warning: CoffeeScript)
[08:54:51] <vitorbaptista> Hey, I'm trying to user toggleClass with a Raphael.js' path, but I'm not having luck. The site I'm testing with is http://cameroon.openspending.org/en/ (the map). I could kinda of pinpoint the problem. JQuery's toggleClass uses its addClass, which uses element.className = "my-class".
[08:55:37] <vitorbaptista> But if I try path_element.className, it doesn't return me a string, but a SVGAnimatedString.
[08:56:05] <vitorbaptista> By reading https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/SVGAnimatedString, it seems that this object is readonly. So we're unable to change this way...
[08:56:23] <vitorbaptista> I was only able to change the class using setAttribute("class", "my-class")
[08:56:46] <vitorbaptista> But I'm wondering if there's a better way
[08:57:03] <wachpwnski> is there a way to drag and drop one table row to another?
[09:03:47] <sunbeam> what is ideal to track when a slider changes?
[09:03:54] <sunbeam> .bind() doesn't capture as you click it
[09:04:11] <mdeboard> sunbeam: .on
[09:04:35] <sunbeam> ahh
[09:05:19] <sunbeam> mdeboard: but what if i want AND click and keyup
[09:06:54] <JFranks> Anyone want to tackle something new with jQuery menu? http://jsfiddle.net/UuF9q/
[09:07:03] <mdeboard> Use the second form for .on, http://api.jquery.com/on/ events-map
[09:08:01] <mdeboard> sunbeam: e.g. $("#foo").on({click: clickFunc(), keyup: keyFunc()})
[09:08:06] <mdeboard> or similar
[09:08:19] <JFranks> Oops forgot one of the problems: http://jsfiddle.net/UuF9q/1/
[09:08:28] <sunbeam> mdeboard: click is the same as drag right?
[09:08:48] <mdeboard> sunbeam: I don't know that, sry
[09:11:33] <sunbeam> Anyone else?
[09:19:00] <JFranks> Oh wait I know this..
[09:21:01] <JFranks> sunbeam: This is how I tackled slider .. http://jsfiddle.net/ebCPZ/  .. The 'updatethedb' is an ajax  function I wrote.. but it should still help you?
[09:22:08] <JFranks> (I could probably write a console.log function and add some HTML if it's still not making sense
[09:25:13] <Manxa> anyone know how to beat this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4208530/xmlhttprequest-origin-null-is-not-allowed-access-control-access-allow-for-file   everything i'm trying isn't working
[09:25:28] <scar> ok i got my ajax working on mobile, but i just discovered it wont work on ie
[09:26:13] <sunbeam> JFranks:
[09:26:15] <sunbeam> thanks
[09:26:42] <sunbeam> JFranks: why .each if i may ask
[09:32:20] <Manxa> anyone run into issues with jquery and and the access-control-allow-origin error?
[09:33:46] <JFranks> sunbeam: .each tackles all the 'slider' class elements
[09:33:57] <sunbeam> JFranks: ok
[09:35:38] <sunbeam> i have got to develop a site based on a design, basically not a hard task
[09:35:41] <sunbeam> only i would like to create a seperate version just for mobile phones
[09:35:42] <sunbeam> whats the best way to go?
[09:37:16] <JFranks> Hmmm I don't have any pages that don't work well on mobile.. I've debated making one of my pages into an 'app' to ease it's use though? (Making apps from what I can tell isn't much harder than authoring a page)
[09:38:42] <sunbeam> Well, I guess it depends what app functionality
[09:40:24] <JFranks> Plus if you make an app and 'review' it plus 'rate' it.. you can stick it on your page with 'schema' that really gives Google a warm-fuzzy in terms of trust/site strength.. Sort of a win-win.. ;)
[09:41:01] <sunbeam> yea but my current target is to create a separate version
[09:41:40] <JFranks> That used to be the way.. but it seems like everyone wants an app.. if they use the page that much they want to install it.. ;)
[09:42:26] <JFranks> And jQuery will really help make your pages mobile friendly anyways..
[09:44:06] <scar> whyd oes this fail ONLY in IE? http://www.orlandopediatricdentistry.com/portal.htm - user demo pass demo
[09:44:55] <JFranks> <notice>Can of Worms</notice> <ignore>obvious explanation</ignore>
[09:50:01] <MindSpark> hi, assume I want to load a webpage through ajax, an entire page. I would want to replace the head tag with the retrieved head and the current body with the retrieved body. How do I do that using Jquey?
[09:50:03] <MindSpark> Jquery
[09:50:25] <MindSpark> the load function gets the entire text (head and body) without any head/body tags
[09:52:00] <Manxa> anyone run into issues with jquery and and the access-control-allow-origin error?
[09:53:29] <docmur> I have a bind("click", function()) to allow a callback to be fired from a button.  This works all the time in firefox but randomily in chrome, is bind() a known issue
[09:53:30] <JFranks> Mindspark: Ummm to you want to climb the tree, chop it down, grow a new tree.. ? Why not just load the other page?
[09:55:23] <MindSpark> JFranks: the client wants it to load in a smoother way
[09:55:31] <MindSpark> fadeout/fadein kind of stuff
[09:55:56] <MindSpark> or have the page transition into the window
[10:03:16] <JFranks> MindSpark: Oh! Well there should be some very simple approaches to that.. :)
[10:03:26] <JFranks> Curious I've never tried.. hmm'
[10:06:50] <MindSpark> JFranks: any ideas that come to mind?
[10:07:15] <MindSpark> when I load the page into a hidden div, it shows stripped out of its head and body tag
[10:07:29] <MindSpark> which means that head and body are inseparable
[10:08:01] <JFranks> MindSpark: You could try http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/ with $( document ) .. then trigger the page load, and the new page should be all hidden elements until the 'onDomReady' calls a fadeIn ?
[10:09:03] <MindSpark> JFranks: this takes will give a blank page for a few seconds until the new page loads
[10:10:05] <JFranks> MindSpark: well that's your choice/style.. you could have a 'spinner' on the page as the only visible item and first item to load?  .. You could use a different effect than 'fade' too..
[10:11:04] <JFranks> MindSpark: I'd actually try 'explode' from JQuery UI
[10:11:05] <JFranks> http://jqueryui.com/effect/
[10:12:34] <Saaether> if you want to load the head into head and body into body perhaps something like this?
[10:12:36] <Saaether> $('head').load('backend.html head', function() { $('body').load('backend.html body'); });
[10:12:44] <Krambiorix> hi guys, my parameters arent 't being passed to the php script: http://pastebin.com/kKUiZsyq   Can someone take a look at it?
[10:12:53] <Saaether> should load the head and then the body
[10:17:02] <JFranks> Oh my.. that's not a good plan.. :)
[10:17:41] <scar> how can i capture a signature from a tablet? is it tablet specific? like a textbox but not
[10:18:03] <JFranks> It's been over a minute and that tab still isn't responding.. I don't know why I expected it to be so easy.. ;)
[10:18:48] <MindSpark> Saaether: have you tried that before? it doesn't seem to be working properly here
[10:19:13] <Saaether> no, was just a thought, never tried to load a page like that before
[10:19:49] <JFranks> scar: think of a tablet as a mouse that does not have a cursor.. think of a signature panel as an element that draws pixels when the mouse is 'down' and moving inside the element.
[10:20:54] <zygote> hey guys i really need some help with a subtle issue. I'm trying to figure out why the "month" and "year" dropdowns require a double click to first initalize them: http://jsfiddle.net/q8fDM/4/
[10:21:12] <JFranks> scar: http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-drawing-app/#demo-simple
[10:27:41] <zygote> anyone :(
[10:27:48] <MindSpark> ok, I got it
[10:27:52] <MindSpark> JFranks: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1236360/how-do-i-replace-the-entire-html-node-using-jquery
[10:28:04] <MindSpark> and Saaether check out the link, this works just perfect
[10:29:23] <Saaether> its kind of odd, personally id just animate the source page, never thought of loading 1 into another heh
[10:33:11] <JFranks> MindSpark: Well I can confirm that a large page chock full of elements IS not easy on the browser to 'animate'.. I just forced a tab to close after a few mins of running at 100% CPU and gobbling over 1.6gb of RAM.. ;p
[10:34:15] <MindSpark> Wow, well, I wasn't going to do an entire movie out of it, just a transition/ease in/bounce kind of thing
[10:34:32] <MindSpark> shouldn't be very cpu intensive, right?
[10:36:52] <Zzaichik>  zygote - toggle also acts as a click event, you're trying to attach two click events.
[10:37:31] <JFranks> MindSpark: Hmm well fadein/out seems very light on the browser.. Just added it to my templates actually.. $('body').fadeIn('slow', function() {});
[10:37:56] <JFranks> (and body { display: none; } .. in the CSS)
[10:39:19] <MindSpark> JFranks: yep, that's what I was saying :)
[10:54:27] <zygote> Zzachik. If i remove the click function the problem is worse. Right now you have to click each dropdown button once before they start workign properly. Without the click function wrapped, it keeps cycling, where you have to click the button once before the menu opens, then it works for one round, then you have to click the button once again
[10:58:59] <manners13> omg dynatree is driving me up the wall
[11:01:53] <zygote> i'm really confused >:(
[11:03:46] <Zzaichik> zygote: I told you the problem man. That is the problem.
[11:04:17] <Zzaichik> finding a way around it is another issue.
[11:04:40] <Sorensen_> Hello, all.  I've found a bug in jQuery UI 1.9 that cripples parts of it for XHTML documents.  I think I need to write a bug report, but I figured I'd discuss it in here, first, since I don't exactly know what I'm doing.
[11:05:10] <JFranks> zygote: Remeber what GIJoe taught you, knowing is only half the battle..
[11:05:48] <zygote> Zzaichik: The click function isn't the problem, since removing it doesn't resolve the problem. I'm aware its something to do with the toggle however.. not really sure why its reacting the way it does.
[11:05:55] <Sorensen_> The problem is that there are hard coded HTML-like element creation - like $("<button>") - that only works as like $("<button/>") in XHTML.  This is most easily seen in dialog() when you have custom buttons.
[11:06:52] <Sorensen_> I'm not even sure how to search for non-closed bugs in the tracker...
[11:08:04] <manners13> hey guys im trying to post a dynatree result to another php page using a submit button but know nothing about javascript so have so far managed with using examples etc,
[11:08:07] <manners13> http://codepad.org/bidS7rW3
[11:08:25] <Sorensen_> Actually, this may even be a jQuery bug, since I think that $("<unclosedtag>") is supposed to work no matter what the document type.  I could be wrong though...
[11:09:00] <manners13> thats the code im trying to use but do understand some of it isnt even relevant for the page/form im using
[11:09:27] <zygote> Sorensen are you referring to the problem I'm having?
[11:10:11] <manners13> the tree contains a list of folders/files that has been backed up and i now need to get the selected node names back into a php variable so i can trigger a restore
[11:10:24] <Sorensen_> I just popped in, I didn't see a chat with you
[11:10:44] <manners13> currently echoSelection3 acheives the list but i dtill need to some how post it to a different form
[11:10:51] <zygote> oh ok. nevermind
[11:10:55] <manners13> sorry page
[11:11:11] <Sorensen_> (Now that I play with this issue, I see that it is a jQuery bug.  $('<tag attr="foo"/>') works but $('<tag attr="foo">') throws a SYNTAX_ERR in Chrome...)
[11:11:26] <Sorensen_> (Yet $('<tag>') works fine)
[11:12:45] <NoiseEee> Sorensen_: ?
[11:14:11] <Sorensen_> Yes, NoiseEee?
[11:14:32] <NoiseEee> $('<tag attr="foo">') does not throw a syntax error in chrome
[11:14:43] <Sorensen_> only in XHTML
[11:14:45] <NoiseEee> i think you should try to recreate in a JSfiddle the problem you are having.
[11:14:52] <Sorensen_> Is there a version of jsFiddle where you can set the MIME type specifically?
[11:15:52] <LordThumper> Is there a reason why there is no .outerHtml() function in jQuery?
[11:16:48] <Sorensen_> Thumper, do you want .parent(), perhaps?
[11:18:37] <LordThumper> No, I want the html contents of a node, including the tags themselves
[11:19:09] <NoiseEee> Sorensen_: i just tried var p = $('<tag attr="ass">'); in a nice new xhtml document and had 0 issues with anything,
[11:19:10] <LordThumper> Currently you have to do $(ele).wrap("<div/>").parent().html()
[11:19:10] <manners13> can anyone help at all, im so confused by javascript cant wait to get back out of it so i can start making progree
[11:19:15] <LordThumper> And unwrapping after
[11:19:17] <manners13> progress
[11:19:48] <mbrzuzy> LordThumper, have you tried: console.log($(ele)[0]); to get the html of the element
[11:19:59] <LordThumper> The javascript library offers $(ele)[0].outerHtml
[11:20:28] <LordThumper> I was curious why this function is not implemented in core jQuery
[11:20:33] <LordThumper> Maybe because of browser support?
[11:22:01] <LordThumper> The function is actually outerHTML
[11:22:47] <manners13> right whats the difference between using ajax to post and just general post
[11:23:23] <manners13> cant believe its so hard to get a js var back to a php var
[11:23:31] <NoiseEee> manners13: a 'general post' loads a new document
[11:23:41] <manners13> right which is what i want to do
[11:23:52] <mbrzuzy> LordThumper, what are you trying to do exactly? Because using $(element)[0] gets me the html of the element
[11:24:07] <mbrzuzy> If I do $('body')[0] I can get the <body></body> as well as its contents
[11:24:09] <manners13> i wantto get the js var echoSelection3 into a php var on data_submit.php
[11:24:31] <NoiseEee> manners13: then put it in a form field and send it via 'general post', or send it via XHR/ajax
[11:24:35] <manners13> http://codepad.org/ZQ7y3jWp
[11:24:59] <manners13> thats my code but im confused big style
[11:25:00] <LordThumper> mbrzuzy: I need a string, not a node object
[11:25:24] <NoiseEee> manners13: good luck
[11:25:29] <manners13> pmsl
[11:26:01] <subsume> What's the best way to pick an item from an array based on an id attribute?
[11:26:03] <LordThumper> As in $("html").html() -> "<html>blah</html>"
[11:26:19] <manners13> not having any luck at all and soon gonna be scrapping the lot and getting back to php
[11:26:21] <LordThumper> I mean $("html").outerHtml() -> "<html>blah</html>"
[11:27:00] <LordThumper> Just curious why it is not in core
[11:27:43] <mbrzuzy> ah
[11:32:15] <LordThumper> In 1.7.2, is this normal? I have a shallow clone of an element stored in clone. Then $foo = $(element).replaceWith(clone), and $foo is a reference to clone, and not to the DOM element created...
[11:32:34] <LSshock> im positioning a div, now is there a good way to get the position? (setting it with css()
[11:32:38] <LSshock> *left position
[11:32:53] <LordThumper> .css("left")
[11:33:16] <LordThumper> "margin-left" or whatever css rule you need
[11:34:35] <LSshock> thanks thats working
[11:39:26] <iliketurtles> if i'm injecting some html using .append(), can I chain .slideDown() onto it?  It doesn't seem to work.
[11:41:55] <LordThumper> iliketurtles: How are you selecting the new elements?
[11:42:10] <iliketurtles> $(this).prev("ul.comments").append(html).slideDown();
[11:43:47] <LordThumper> append() returns the container element
[11:45:24] <LordThumper> $(html).appendTo($(this).prev("ul.comments")).slideDown()
[11:45:28] <LordThumper> Somethind like that should work
[11:45:32] <LordThumper> Something*
[11:47:25] <iliketurtles> ok let me hack away at that
[11:49:11] <iliketurtles> awesome works perfect, thanks LordThumper
[11:49:27] <LordThumper> np
[11:50:18] <manners13> http://codepad.org/wQqtssPB can anyone tell me what im doing wrong here
[11:50:21] <manners13> http://codepad.org/wQqtssPB
[11:50:34] <manners13> sorry didnt mean to press it twice
[11:51:16] <manners13> im trying to submit the value echoSelection3 to submit_data using a hidden form
[11:51:29] <ryanneufeld> manners13: what does the php produce when rendered?
[11:52:08] <manners13> at the moment i have print_r $_POST which just prints array()
[11:52:10] <NoiseEee> manners13: your <a> tag is taking you to a new location.
[11:52:19] <manners13> yes its supposed to
[11:52:24] <NoiseEee> manners13: no its not
[11:52:39] <manners13> huh ok now im really puzzled
[11:52:41] <NoiseEee> manners13: you want it to run your setValue function and then submit the form.
[11:52:51] <manners13> how do i get to submit_data.php
[11:52:57] <NoiseEee> manners13: an <a> tag takes you to a new document immediately, and has nothing to do with forms.
[11:53:11] <NoiseEee> manners13: stop the event in setValue().
[11:53:22] <NoiseEee> manners13: also, learn javascript.
[11:53:59] <manners13> im trying to get out of javascript lol
[11:54:10] <NoiseEee> manners13: also im assuming you want the value of $('#echoSelection3') and not the object
[11:54:15] <LordThumper> If you are a web developer you need javascript
[11:54:27] <manners13> yup i do NoiseEee
[11:54:34] <LordThumper> You don't have any alternatives
[11:54:35] <manners13> im not a webdeveloper
[11:54:37] <NoiseEee> manners13: in other words, there's a whole host of things wrong with that script, and unless you find someone with nothing to do today, you'll have to figure this out.
[11:54:40] <NoiseEee> manners13: then hire one.
[11:54:43] <NoiseEee> good luck
[11:54:53] <manners13> how much
[11:55:06] <manners13> for just getting me out of javascript and back to php
[11:55:41] <manners13> with that value ( list of filenames
[11:56:04] <docmur> can you put call a post from with in a post callback?
[11:57:21] <manners13> anyone want a job lol
[11:58:25] <otto015> Can anyone tell me why this does not work when I resize my browser? http://pastebin.com/h72pJQ5q
[12:01:27] <Saaether> otto: you're only checking the width at load... if the window size changes after that the script doesnt care
[12:02:38] <ShawnRisk> What is the best way to link to various li's?  I want to add html to li's and when click on an image, it takes me there.  How would I do that?  Code: $('#slideshowid li').each(function(index) { $(this).addClass('slide-' + index); $('#slidedots').prepend('<a href=""><img src="http://totallyadd.devsiteserver.com/wp-content/themes/totallyadd/imagesv2/logo-gray.png" /></a>'); });
[12:04:08] <imsky> manners13: what you got
[12:04:29] <manners13> look at the code and tell me a price
[12:05:19] <imsky> link me
[12:05:25] <imsky> never mind
[12:07:38] <Kambfhase> ?demo @ ShawnRisk
[12:07:52] <Kambfhase> meh
[12:08:25] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: all I want to do is have dots that if you click one that goes to that slide.
[12:09:03] <Kambfhase> here you have some dots: ...
[12:09:49] <Kambfhase> could you provide more code, or ist your page live?
[12:09:56] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: page is not live
[12:10:15] <Kambfhase> you do know, there are plugins for slideshows?
[12:10:33] <ShawnRisk> Yes I do, but building my own
[12:10:37] <Kambfhase> kk
[12:10:53] <ShawnRisk> I want like this: http://thiagosf.net/projects/jquery/skitter/ I am trying to the dots at the bottom.
[12:11:18] <Kambfhase> ah, get it now.
[12:13:21] <Kambfhase> $('#slidedots').on('click', 'a', function(){ /* a dot was clicked */ });
[12:14:38] <mdel> !
[12:15:00] <Kambfhase> within that function handler you'll have to get the a index: function( event ){ var index = $(event.target).index(); /* slide to li */ }
[12:17:31] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: would I than have to add <a href="index"></a> around the image?
[12:17:45] <Kambfhase> no
[12:17:53] <Kambfhase> your href="" is just fine
[12:18:10] <docmur> I still have 0 idea whats happening with my script.  I can update the localdata base but when I upload my code to the dev server I can't update the identical phpmyadmin record.  It's not a premission's issue
[12:18:16] <Kambfhase> oh, yeah, you might want to return false
[12:22:54] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: I am doing something wrong here.  Do I put the function( event ) within the .on function?  If so, this is broken somewhere as the slideshow is coming out messy and that means the code is not right.
[12:23:25] <Kambfhase> er, no. that IS the event handler. Its not finished, though.
[12:24:27] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: oh
[12:27:04] <NexHD> hi
[12:27:12] <NexHD> can someonw help me?

[12:30:19] <vladikoff> NexHD, yes
[12:32:12] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: I am still confused

[12:33:37] <NexHD> after i remove that , the code is work
[12:33:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Any suggestions on recent jquery books?
[12:34:00] <supsup> docmur watch ajax request go out on ur prod server and see if it's responding, and if so with what
[12:34:07] <supsup> perhaps the file Web/updateInformation.php does not exist on your prod server
[12:36:03] <NexHD> can you check my code?
[12:36:21] <NexHD> to see if is ok?
[12:37:42] <otto015> I have 3 colums aligned as #left, #menu(middle), #right. When I resize to mobile I want #menu to be on top, and have #left and #right under.. how the hell do I make that happen?
[12:38:23] <otto015> So it changes from #left, #menu(middle), #right ----> #menu, #left, #right
[12:38:43] <Eviltwin> NexHD: I think you've failed to understand the point of a jsFiddle

[12:38:46] <bot-t> NexHD, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:39:10] <NexHD> ok
[12:39:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Any suggestions on recent jquery books?

[12:42:24] <supsup> NextHD why not just use a validation library already made?  like  http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[12:42:32] <NexHD> this is the url http://inset.zapto.org/register.php and the function beco active on blur and focus , but when i have added a user check for mysql database was no working anymore? before when was just a input validation he was work
[12:42:33] <NexHD> ?
[12:43:19] <otto015> Sorry, I try again : http://pastebin.com/NjvHUZXx - when I resize I want middle on top and left & right under. Any ideas?

[12:44:45] <wurst> how do I filter() a filter()?
[12:45:32] <Pilate> uhm, .filter().filter()
[12:45:46] <wurst> var $textboxes = $(":input.istext").filter(function() { return $.trim(this.value).length > intLimit; });
[12:45:54] <wurst> is my filter, then I want to filter that
[12:46:06] <Pilate> ok so based on the ridiculously simple construct i provided above
[12:46:10] <Pilate> what would you do next
[12:47:07] <wurst> it doesnt work like this... $textboxes.filter('.istext').css("border", "1px solid orange");
[12:47:24] <wurst> $textboxes.filter('.isint').css("border", "1px solid orange");
[12:47:46] <wurst> tried everything I can think of
[12:47:55] <Pilate> yes it does
[12:47:57] <Eviltwin> So you want $textboxes.filter('.istext.isint') ?
[12:48:14] <wurst> sorry, just this one $textboxes.filter('.isint').css("border", "1px solid orange");
[12:48:39] <Pilate> not only does it work, its provided in the examples on the .filter page
[12:48:45] <Pilate> youre screwing something else up
[12:49:04] <NexHD> someone watch my link?
[12:49:10] <wurst> I saw the examples.  That's why I'm stumped.  should be working but isn't
[12:49:11] <LordThumper> $textboxes.filter('.isint')
[12:49:19] <LordThumper> console.log($textboxes.filter('.isint').length)
[12:49:25] <LordThumper> What does that give?
[12:49:36] <LordThumper> If 0 then no elements have been found (you are using a wrong selector)
[12:49:56] <wurst> always zero
[12:50:12] <LordThumper> Ok what is this attribute/property you want to filter by?
[12:50:26] <LordThumper> .isint mean has class "isint"
[12:50:29] <wurst> but my first selector works   var $textboxes = $(":input.istext").filter(function() { return $.trim(this.value).length > intLimit; });
[12:50:45] <NexHD> anybody know the reason for that is not working?
[12:50:51] <wurst> yes, some textboxes have both istext and isint classes
[12:51:01] <Pilate> lol
[12:51:06] <NoiseEee> why :input and not input, wurst?

[12:51:24] <Eviltwin> There's a glaring syntax error
[12:51:31] <Eviltwin> Read those slides and learn to use a debugger
[12:52:20] <wurst> actually I don't even need input. but I still have the issue
[12:52:34] <LordThumper> $textboxes.length > 0 ?
[12:52:52] <LordThumper> If > 0 paste one of the textbox html
[12:53:55] <LordThumper> console.log($textboxes.first()) would do
[12:55:07] <LordThumper> or $textboxes[0].outerHTML
[12:55:14] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: still around?  I understand what you were saying now.  I just don't understand what the link should be
[12:55:18] <wurst> I got it. I'm an idiot.
[12:55:30] <Kambfhase> what link?
[12:55:45] <LordThumper> Wrong case in .isint?
[12:55:57] <wurst> my intLimit variable... forgot I changed it
[12:56:11] <wurst> always something simple
[12:56:26] <wurst> Thanks for the help though!!
[12:56:31] <LordThumper> np
[12:56:43] <NexHD> what mean this
[12:56:45] <NexHD> SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[12:56:45] <NexHD> [ÃŽntrerupe la aceastÄƒ eroare] 	
[12:56:45] <NexHD> $("#username") {
[12:56:46] <NexHD> ?
[12:57:07] <NexHD> where ; is missing?
[12:57:34] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: $('#slidedots').prepend('<a href=""><img src="/wp-content/themes/totallyadd/imagesv2/logo-gray.png" /></a>');  What would the href be?  Do I need to add something to the li's?
[12:58:15] <Kambfhase> if you look at my code again, you'll see, that I use "event delegation"
[12:58:52] <Kambfhase> instead of using a special href for each link, i just use one handler, that nows the offset of the dot.
[12:59:15] <Kambfhase> now that offset, called index, should equal that one of the slide.
[12:59:27] <Kambfhase> so clicking dot #2 will trigger slide #2
[13:00:13] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: let me try
[13:01:40] <docmur> what would cause a post to fail on a remote server but not a local box, given  that both the server and localbox have the same repo synced
[13:02:17] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: this is what I have: http://pastebin.com/N0bYVGL3
[13:04:10] <fubar10> Hey guys, I have a question on the .load function -- I have images loaded using the load function, but when the content is load -- I'm directed to the top of the page.
[13:04:27] <Eviltwin> NexHD: $("#username") { ... } is not valid markup
[13:04:37] <Siver> fubar10: preventDefault()
[13:04:39] <Eviltwin> What do you think that's supposed to do?
[13:04:57] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: You know that slideshowid has the li's and slidedots only has the dots?
[13:04:59] <fubar10> Siver, where would I add preventDefault()?
[13:05:27] <Siver> can you paste your code in jsfiddle please?
[13:06:41] <MXBrandon> what does the last parameter specify in a self executing function?  ex:   (function($) { ...})(jQuery);
[13:06:53] <Kambfhase> ShawnRisk: http://pastebin.com/Q1kZ033E
[13:07:09] <MXBrandon> Is it adding it as a prototype to jQuery?
[13:07:21] <fubar10> Siver http://piratepad.net/2XJlieemas
[13:07:33] <Kambfhase> MXBrandon: that is an IIFE: an immediately invoked function expression
[13:07:37] <Jon47> MXBrandon: it's passing it as a paramter to the function
[13:08:17] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: looking
[13:08:20] <MXBrandon> I've used IIFE's before, but never with params
[13:08:20] <Jon47> just means jQuery in the immediately invoked function is passed as a parameter and within the scope of the function it's passed to it will be referred to as $
[13:08:47] <MXBrandon> ah, ok
[13:09:02] <Siver> fubar10: http://piratepad.net/2XJlieemas
[13:09:19] <MXBrandon> So if I had another object called foo and I wanted to refer to it as $ in the IIFE, I could do that too
[13:09:36] <fubar10> Thanks Siver! Mind explaining why it should go here?
[13:10:10] <fubar10> Actually, it still takes me to the top of the page.
[13:10:24] <Siver> Because it jumps to the anchor you're using by default (#firstImg) ... to avoid anchor jumping you use the preventDefault() method of an event you attach to the function
[13:10:32] <Siver> it does?
[13:10:41] <LordThumper> MXBrandon, yes just like in a regular function variable scope
[13:11:10] <Siver> fubar10: try this http://piratepad.net/2XJlieemas
[13:11:17] <LordThumper> jQuery plugins are written like that so authors don't need to use the full jQuery syntax (ex jQuery(selector) )
[13:11:48] <LordThumper> As some sites don't have $ mapped to jQuery
[13:12:11] <fubar10> Nope, still not doing it.
[13:15:36] <Siver> fubar10: why is the return false; in there?
[13:15:47] <MXBrandon> LordThu>  So I could in essence just do (function(jq) { jq('#x').css({'visible':'hidden'}); } )(jQuery)       Is that correct?  Not that I want to, but just theoretically so I understand whats going on
[13:15:52] <fubar10> NO clue. I am thinking that it might be that...
[13:16:35] <fubar10> That prevents me from going into the actual image url.
[13:16:44] <Kambfhase> MXBrandon: correct.
[13:16:58] <MXBrandon> Kambfhase> OK, cool. Thanks
[13:18:54] <Siver> fubar10: I personally haven't used load() before, but looking at the docs you need to supply a source and I can't see that in your code? You only supply a closure which would be the complete callback
[13:19:05] <Siver> What exactly are you trying to achieve?
[13:22:49] <Siver> fubar10: I can never see that snippet of yours working
[13:23:55] <jedimind> look harder!
[13:26:24] <Kambfhase> look harder - thats the usual bullshit advice i get, when i dont find a geocache.
[13:28:50] <WebDragon> hey, what do they call that sort of multiboxed mosaic style of layout you see on some pages? basically just pictures and a small amount of text that links to the full article
[13:29:08] <WebDragon> I know there's a word or turn of phrase that describes it but cannot recall what it is
[13:30:33] <shoky> metro?
[13:30:49] <Kambfhase> Its not metro anymore
[13:30:59] <Kambfhase> its Windows 8 Modern UI Style
[13:31:08] <Kambfhase> or some bullshit like that
[13:31:30] <shoky> i'll keep to saying metro thx ;P

[13:36:04] <NexHD> hi i have another error test if a user exist with this user "roscatu" and if is not work can you see the code?
[13:36:06] <NexHD> http://inset.zapto.org/register.php
[13:36:07] <NexHD> here
[13:37:11] <DeltaHeavy> cript
[13:37:27] <DeltaHeavy> Woops sorry
[13:39:33] <ShawnRisk> Kambfhase: Are you saying I need to create the animation to slide to the slide I want to get to?  Like slide.animate({opacity: 1.0}, 1000)(index); and e.preventDefault();
[13:40:08] <Kambfhase> yeah, i dont know, how you wanto to slide, so you need to fill in that last part all by yourself. :)
[13:40:20] <Kambfhase> right where it says
[13:42:22] <MXBrandon> Could someone take a look at this?  I am trying to modify a function that used to be a IIFE and make it an object so I can call multiple instances of it at a time.  Somewhere in here I did something wrong  (both old code and new code is shown, in a very simplified form)
[13:42:28] <MXBrandon> http://jsfiddle.net/9P8aW/1/
[13:43:24] <jeffsmykil> Could someone whip up a quick example of on on screen element hiding and showing, repeatedly, at a random interval each time?
[13:44:10] <jeffsmykil> I am unsure how to attack this
[13:44:24] <Kambfhase> MXBrandon: http://jsfiddle.net/9P8aW/2/
[13:44:32] <EyePulp> argh - so I've got a chat system that operates from a popped-up window, and I want to detect and handle window closure (meaning send a notice back to the chat server that they're closing the window, instead of constantly polling).  I've tried all sorts of $(window).bind('beforeunload', function(e){} ); solutions, but none seem to get anything sent off to the server.  Google searches haven't produced a working solution (for me at least)
[13:44:33] <EyePulp> Using FF to test stuff atm.
[13:45:31] <EyePulp> is $(window).bind('beforeunload', function(e){} ); the right way to approach this?
[13:46:00] <MXBrandon> jeffsmykil>  http://jsfiddle.net/F4kZa/
[13:46:44] <silverwind> EyePulp: I think you won't have any other choice than polling as the beforeUnload event doesn't work on all browsers
[13:47:03] <jeffsmykil> MXBrandon: maybe my explanaition wasn't clear.  THat happens every three seconds, I would like this to happen the equivalent of Math.random() * 5000
[13:47:09] <jeffsmykil> with a new value each time
[13:47:50] <MXBrandon> Kambfhase> Thanks!  So it looks like I basically had the _defaultOptions in the wrong place...if I move that within the connect function, then I should be able to call connect() with no variables?
[13:49:30] <Kambfhase> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/8Ff6s/
[13:49:48] <Kambfhase> MXBrandon: no, you forgot to return a value ;)
[13:50:04] <fubar10> I'm trying to follow this tutorial but if my image requires scrolling, it automatically takes me to the top of the page regardless of what I do: http://www.micahcarrick.com/change-image-with-jquery.html
[13:50:19] <fubar10> I've tried to do preventDefault(), but that doesn't work.
[13:50:42] <fubar10> I've also tried scrollToTop to save the location on the page and then load the location again.
[13:50:45] <jeffsmykil> kambfhase ty
[13:50:47] <jeffsmykil> ill look
[13:51:59] <MXBrandon> jeff> var timeInt = Math.random() * 5000;
[13:51:59] <MXBrandon>     alert('Next: ' + timeInt + ' seconds');
[13:52:01] <MXBrandon> ack
[13:52:03] <MXBrandon> wrong paste
[13:52:09] <EyePulp> silverwind: nuts
[13:52:17] <MXBrandon> jeffsmykil>  http://jsfiddle.net/F4kZa/1/
[13:52:31] <MXBrandon> ah, sorry, didnt see Kambfhase sent it too
[13:52:52] <jeffsmykil> thats a timeout
[13:52:58] <jeffsmykil> it only happens once
[13:53:02] <jeffsmykil> i need over and over :/
[13:53:09] <Kambfhase> mine works ;)
[13:53:11] <MXBrandon> jeff> Its a timeout inside of a function that recalls itself
[13:53:25] <MXBrandon> mine works too :)
[13:53:35] <Kambfhase> MXBrandon: you really should the opening brace on the line before, egyptian style!
[13:53:47] <DeltaHeavy> Is there a way to have something execute after an $.ajax request regardless of what happens? As it is I have my loader fading out if an error occurs or if it's successful but it feels sloppy.
[13:54:08] <silverwind> DeltaHeavy: .always
[13:54:17] <MXBrandon> Kambfhase>  haha, I know.  its an hold habbit from where I used to work.  They required it on its own line
[13:54:36] <Kambfhase> JSFiddle has a "Tidy Up" button. ;)
[13:54:36] <silverwind> MXBrandon: In JS, it will bite you.
[13:54:45] <jeffsmykil> I will try this when i get home thank you mxbrandon and kambfhase
[13:54:46] <MXBrandon> silverwind> Why is that?
[13:55:04] <DeltaHeavy> silverwind: Oh damn I've been coding deprechated stuff
[13:55:11] <silverwind> MXBrandon:
[13:55:14] <silverwind> return
[13:55:15] <silverwind> {
[13:55:16] <silverwind> }
[13:55:42] <silverwind> Won't work the way you think;
[13:55:46] <Kambfhase> why would you want to return a block?
[13:55:56] <silverwind> Kambfhase: It's an empty object
[13:56:08] <DeltaHeavy> Can anybody suggest a good tutorial for the proper use of .ajax?
[13:57:08] <xckpd7> question: for jQuery UI, if I'm doing a range (from [date] to [date]), how do I make the min date on the to field one day greater than the from?
[13:57:11] <xckpd7> http://jsfiddle.net/D35nU/17/
[13:57:21] <MXBrandon> Deltaheavy>  http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax.asp
[13:58:11] <DeltaHeavy> MXBrandon: That doesn't outline the full functionality of the AJAX method, plus I'd like a more credible source
[13:58:25] <scar> these vars get passed thru my ouput ( http://pastebin.com/PKQspZud ), yet only 1 var gets passed for some reason. the second one is always defined.
[13:58:54] <MXBrandon> deltaheavy: w3schools is quite credible.   But for the most credible source, you could go here:  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/   ;-)
[13:59:05] <shoky> MXBrandon: see www.w3fools.com
[13:59:06] <silverwind> MXBrandon: http://jsfiddle.net/AAV8v/
[13:59:29] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/ajax-deferreds
[14:00:15] <MXBrandon> shoky> Hmm, interesting.  I guess I never really looked that much into them.  Just know their name is all over the place
[14:00:29] <silverwind> Deferred are wonderful :)
[14:01:15] <DeltaHeavy> MXBrandon: w3fools.com, it's quite picky but does have some legit beef. Also the docs don't provide a full example of something that looks like this but not using deprechated options: http://pastebin.com/g3Wfam4A
[14:01:20] <shoky> MXBrandon: they're blocked on my google searches ;p
[14:01:23] <DeltaHeavy> MXBrandon: I do apprichate you effort though
[14:01:40] <DeltaHeavy> MXBrandon: W3C != w3schools
[14:01:59] <Krinkle> quite the contrary
[14:02:14] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: THese are using the deprechated methods, aren't they? This is what I'm using now: http://pastebin.com/g3Wfam4A
[14:02:17] <Krinkle> I think W3C laughs their ass off of w3schools (as any serious web person should)
[14:02:39] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: which deprecated methods?
[14:03:16] <MXBrandon> DeltaHeavy>  I know they are not W3C :)  But they are pretty descent for quick reference stuff sometimes.  I've never actually read their full tutorials or anything to have a complaint though
[14:03:22] <Krinkle> If you need general info on javascript or the DOM, I'd recommend MDN. Although sometimes (naturally) Firefox specific, its the best I've found so far.
[14:03:28] <MXBrandon> shoky>  That makes sense, thanks
[14:03:40] <DeltaHeavy> shocky: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/   If you look where it says 'Deprechation Notice' a little bit down the page.
[14:03:49] <Krinkle> especially for a quick reference it is more useful than w3schools
[14:03:56] <DeltaHeavy> success, error, complete. Instead I should be using done, fail, and always
[14:04:21] <shoky> DeltaHeavy:  that's talking about   .success(...)  .error(...) and .complete(....)
[14:04:23] <Krinkle> https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push
[14:04:24] <Krinkle> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_push.asp
[14:04:29] <shoky> not about the 'success' or 'error' options
[14:05:13] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: but yes if you wanna use the same API for deferreds and ajax (since ajax is using deferreds) then stick to  .done .fail .always
[14:06:51] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Sorry I'm a little confused right now. You've seen the way I currently do it yes? Could you perhaps provide me an example of how that would look using .done, .fail, and .always
[14:07:08] <shoky> sure
[14:07:35] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Thanks :)
[14:08:20] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: http://pastebin.com/hSRet9pj
[14:08:29] <shoky> very straightforward
[14:10:31] <shoky> could have also done:  var request = $.ajax(...);  request.done(...);  request.fail(...);
[14:11:41] <DeltaHeavy> That sounds a LOT cleaner
[14:11:42] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks!
[14:12:25] <shoky> yw
[14:17:59] <DeltaHeavy> What would the 'always' method's second paramter be in comparison to .fail or .done? Is it the same as any of those used?
[14:22:37] <NexHD> how i put a condition if in php code an if echo something?
[14:23:13] <DeltaHeavy> NexHD: I don't understand your question. Can you rephrase that?
[14:23:38] <Eviltwin> NexHD: Talk to #php or ##php
[14:23:40] <DeltaHeavy> http://pastebin.com/FwTd3eF6I'm trying to execute an AJAX call but it's not working. The .fail method executes as well as the .done method. Why is this? Any critisism is welcome as this is my first attempt at making AJAX work with non-deprechated options http://pastebin.com/FwTd3eF6
[14:23:44] <Eviltwin> This is #jquery
[14:24:16] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: i think .always callback will get .done's arguments on success and .fail's arguments on error
[14:25:07] <TelFiRE> Seems the documentation on the validate method is a bit lacking compared to other jQuery docs. Can anyone explain to me the simplest way to validate a given field, how do you know what pattern to validate it for, etc
[14:25:09] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: .fail is called, and gives me 'The following error has occured: error'
[14:25:12] <NexHD> i have function(data) is ok to give me a result with my entire html hader code?
[14:25:18] <DeltaHeavy> And then I get redirected and logged in and everything
[14:25:25] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: .fail and .done both execute? that's odd..
[14:25:46] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Yep, I'm stumped =/
[14:27:25] <shoky> DeltaHeavy first of all don't alert.. console.log, and put commas instead of +'s  (i.e. don't concatenate into a string)
[14:27:27] <djbpython> why is this format not used in my input box?: $('input#start').datepicker({ dateFormat: 'dd/mm/yy' });
[14:27:27] <djbpython> it still uses mm/dd/yy
[14:27:47] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: i mean in the .fail callback
[14:27:53] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Why use console.log? IE doesn't support it and you have to have your console open to view the message right?
[14:28:10] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: for debugging purposes.. IE supports it if you have your console open ;P
[14:28:27] <danheberden> DeltaHeavy: so you get the "invalid login" or "there is a problem" alert AND "the following error has occured" alerts?
[14:29:07] <DeltaHeavy> danheberden: I get the 'fail' alert, and I get a page reload from 'done'
[14:29:09] <shoky> DeltaHeavy:  in console.log you'd actually get to see the error object, for example, and not just whatever it's .toString() returned for the concatenation
[14:29:22] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Ok right
[14:29:27] <danheberden> DeltaHeavy: i bet that isn't what is reloading
[14:29:34] <shoky> ^^
[14:29:41] <danheberden> like - replace the "reload()" stuff with a log line
[14:29:47] <danheberden> to make sure it's THAT function
[14:30:36] <DeltaHeavy> danheberden: With a log line?
[14:30:46] <shoky> don't reload, just log.
[14:30:49] <danheberden> like console.log('wat');
[14:30:56] <danheberden> or the 1990's style alerts you got going on
[14:30:57] <danheberden> whatever
[14:31:04] <danheberden> but i bet your form
[14:31:09] <danheberden> you know, the #login-submit
[14:31:13] <danheberden> is actually submitting
[14:31:17] <danheberden> thus the reload/refresh
[14:31:31] <danheberden> because i don't see a click(function(e){ e.preventDefault();
[14:31:31] <danheberden> in there
[14:31:38] <danheberden> (and i looked hard)
[14:31:45] <shoky> i'd bet on that too
[14:32:06] <DeltaHeavy> danheberden: I have 'onclick="return false;"' on my form. Is that bad?
[14:32:16] <danheberden> yeah, that doesn't stop the form from submitting
[14:32:21] <danheberden> also, that shit is icky
[14:32:27] <danheberden> cuz it's all up in your html
[14:32:32] <DeltaHeavy> Oh shoot, how do I do that? Is <form> valuable for semantical HTML?
[14:32:37] <danheberden> like the clap on someone you date - YOU DONT WANT IT
[14:32:49] <danheberden> DeltaHeavy: that click handler - it gets passed event
[14:32:52] <danheberden> oh hold on, i'll just fork this
[14:33:31] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: you should prolly change $('#login-submit').click  to:   $('#theFormId').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault();  ... ajax ... })
[14:33:55] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Oh awesome, thanks
[14:34:11] <danheberden> DeltaHeavy: http://pastebin.com/pJ0Ah4b9
[14:34:15] <danheberden> with notes!
[14:34:18] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: That works with IE8?
[14:34:20] <danheberden> but yeah, what shoky said
[14:34:36] <shoky> don't see why not
[14:34:53] <danheberden> IE8 might be shitty, but it still has, like, forms that submit 'n stuff
[14:35:23] <DeltaHeavy> event.preventDefault() I'm thinking about more so but from your responses I'll assume so
[14:36:09] <DeltaHeavy> Also is my timeout high enough? When I'm at school and the internet is REALLY shit there it times out sometimes
[14:36:19] <DeltaHeavy> Whatdo you guys use for that?
[14:38:21] <danheberden> DeltaHeavy: i don't use timeout ,i just wait for it to fail
[14:38:46] <DeltaHeavy> danheberden: How long could that leave a user hanging for?
[14:38:59] <danheberden> depends on the server
[14:39:11] <danheberden> but, like, THATS what should be fixed
[14:39:21] <DeltaHeavy> I'll up it to 20 seconds then
[14:39:35] <DeltaHeavy> So IF the server is going full retard it'll stop I guess
[14:39:54] <DeltaHeavy> Actually 30 seconds cause of people with shit internet and all
[14:43:33] <djbpython> hmm, actually datepicker({...}) is not using any options specified
[14:44:45] <mouses> i have a bunch of nested calls to append elements, like:   list.append($("<a></a>", {"class": "link", href: "#"})
[14:45:24] <mouses> how can i call a .click(function(){} on a the <a> within a .each loop that appends those <a> to the list?
[14:46:15] <mouses> i know i can throw "onclick=" into that object, but thats old school and will show the function in the browser's status bar, right?
[14:46:15] <tachyean_> list.find('a').click(function() {});
[14:46:36] <shoky> list.append( $("<a></a>", {"class": "link", href: "#"}).click(...) );   or  $("<a></a>", {"class": "link", href: "#"}).click(...).appendTo(list)
[14:47:07] <shoky> or var newEl = $('<a>...); newEl.click(...);  list.append(newEl);
[14:47:14] <shoky> or whatever
[14:47:50] <mouses> oh so i can call append after defining the click function?
[14:47:53] <mouses> lemme try
[14:49:17] <shoky> even if you couldn't..  var newEl=..; list.append(newEl); newEl.click(...)
[14:50:18] <mouses> ok thanks, got it working by adding the .append() right after defining the .click
[14:50:29] <mouses> seems  unreadable but it worked
[14:50:42] <shoky> if you want it readable then make it readable..
[14:51:23] <mouses> myListStuff.append($("<a></a>", {"class": "link", href: "#"}).click(function(){alert("hi")})
[14:51:36] <mouses> .append()..
[14:51:48] <shoky> like i showed, you can break it out
[14:51:52] <mouses> myListStuff.append($("<a></a>", {"class": "link", href: "#"}).click(function(){alert("hi")}).append(...)
[14:51:53] <shoky> it doesn't have to be one big statement
[14:52:08] <shoky> and you can use appendTo instead also
[14:52:11] <mouses> well its in one big nested .append before and afterwards
[14:52:14] <shoky> look at my examples
[14:52:18] <mouses> i see
[14:52:20] <mouses> cool
[14:52:22] <mouses> thanks
[15:31:46] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:35:51] <TelFiRE> if I have <div><div class="blah cur"></div><div class="blah"></div></div> and I do $('.cur').parent().next('blah'); am I going to the first blah or the second?
[15:38:57] <DanielDD> hey, I would like to know if it's safe enough to rely on a JSON 'variable' to let the user log or not based on that variable
[15:39:08] <DanielDD> or you can "trick" that json easily?
[15:40:37] <shoky> DanielDD: a user can ultimately change whatever they want on the client-side
[15:41:57] <shoky> TelFiRE: neither
[15:42:17] <TelFiRE> what's the right way to select the second one
[15:42:35] <razzi> get rid of .parent()
[15:43:15] <TelFiRE> $(".cur").next(".blah") ?
[15:43:25] <razzi> sure
[15:43:34] <TelFiRE> :/ not working for me
[15:43:49] <TelFiRE> lemme make a jsfid
[15:44:10] <razzi> telfire .. perhaps you already know , console.log() is great for debugging ..
[15:44:48] <razzi> for example , try console.log(  $(".cur") ) and console.log( $(".cur").next(".blah") ) so see what is being selected
[15:45:54] <TelFiRE> not really sure how to use that
[15:45:57] <TelFiRE> I was just alerting the id
[15:46:01] <TelFiRE> and always getting undefined
[15:46:10] <TelFiRE> when I do what you just suggested, the console logs "undefined" still
[15:46:11] <TelFiRE> not very helpful
[15:46:32] <razzi> ok, you got the fiddle up?
[15:47:04] <shoky> it's the line above undefined that matters ;p
[15:47:13] <shoky> undefined is just the return value of console.log
[15:47:22] <shoky> (most likely)
[15:48:43] <TelFiRE> razzi: http://jsfiddle.net/bXrUW/
[15:49:17] <TelFiRE> shoky: there's no such line
[15:49:23] <TelFiRE> it simply logs "undefined"
[15:50:41] <TelFiRE> if I take off the attr('id') I get not even that, just []
[15:51:46] <razzi> there doesn't seem to be a class cur in the markup
[15:52:00] <TelFiRE> sorry i simplified for my example here
[15:52:02] <TelFiRE> it's cur_page
[15:52:04] <docmur> What would be the proper method for writing a function like this: http://jsfiddle.net/rEUBM/2/
[15:52:29] <TelFiRE> and it's not in the markup tuntil it's toggled on by the jquery
[15:52:41] <razzi> no, cur_page either
[15:52:45] <shoky> yes i meant if you log a jq obj, not the id attr
[15:53:09] <TelFiRE> razzi: as per the 6th line of JS, there is indeed a cur_page
[15:54:01] <clondike> docmur: i would use a template lib like mustache or underscore to avoid having to write my html in my JS
[15:54:23] <clondike> then you'd just go var form = $('#form_template').tmpl(); and then form.appendTo('#some_destination')
[15:54:25] <clondike> much cleaner
[15:55:03] <docmur> Okay but how would you actually write the functions I tried to so I could output the html?
[15:55:43] <TelFiRE> razzi: the markup is not important, it's a mess. but I'm fairly confident my btn_next click function has it right, and is selecting the right element. yet it doesn't work. and debugging isn't working because it won't tell me anything but undefined
[15:56:01] <razzi> telfire, try nextAll()
[15:56:34] <razzi> apparent, the element right next to your target is input with type hidden
[15:56:37] <TelFiRE> razzi: uh, that's not what I want to do though
[15:56:42] <clondike> docmur: like http://jsfiddle.net/rEUBM/3/ ?
[15:56:43] <razzi> apparently*
[15:56:48] <clondike> perhaps i misunderstand the question
[15:57:08] <TelFiRE> razzi: yes, it's a hidden input, but that is not the next("fieldset.step") so it should NOT be selecting that, and if it is, that's a bug
[15:57:37] <TelFiRE> nextALL selects more than one element. I do not want more than one element. I want the IMMEDIATE NEXT FIELDSET that has the class step
[15:57:42] <razzi> lol
[15:57:59] <razzi> you want nextAll...
[15:58:25] <TelFiRE> razzi: no, i really, really don't. I do NOT want more than one element
[15:58:30] <TelFiRE> "Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector." That is NOT what I want
[15:58:30] <razzi> sigh
[15:58:41] <TelFiRE> I want only ONE sibling
[16:00:08] <TelFiRE> razzi: I do appreciate the page but I'm thinking maybe you don't understand what I'm trying to do... I verified in the jsfid, indeed, if I use nextAll it selects MULTIPLE fieldsets. not just one.
[16:00:14] <TelFiRE> *help with the page
[16:00:16] <razzi> stop writing so many stuff and think..
[16:00:37] <razzi> you are confused of what next() does
[16:00:44] <razzi> you want nextAll().first()
[16:02:47] <TelFiRE> razzi: I see, yes I was confused about what next did
[16:03:25] <madprops> is there a way to detect when the url is changed without reloading the page? haschange is not working for me if only the url changes
[16:05:14] <clondike> how are you changing the URL, madprops ?
[16:05:15] <razzi> madprops, unless something neat with history is possible, you could try cookies to store last url
[16:05:31] <TelFiRE> cool, basically workin. thanks :)
[16:06:27] <madprops> clondike, razzi im changing it with window.history.pushState, and the urls are being stored fine that's not the problem
[16:07:58] <madprops> razzi, i create the history by storing them in an array
[16:09:10] <clondike> madprops: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5129386/how-to-dected-when-history-pushstate-and-history-replacestate-are-used
[16:09:25] <clondike> seems there is no event for it yet, maybe you could trigger() a custom event?
[16:14:53] <waffl> Hi - I'm trying to use jQuery with some forms generated by wordpress, but they have strange id's, how would i access a 'select' like this: <select name="fields[field_5075fff017f32][0][field_5075fff017fe1][]" id="fields[field_5075fff017f32][0][field_5075fff017fe1]" class="taxonomy-field" >
[16:15:09] <waffl> I'm confused how to access it by id
[16:15:14] <TelFiRE> $(".cur_page").prevAll("fieldset.step").last()  << what is "last" is it the one that is furthest down in the DOM, or is it the highest in the DOM since we are searching upward?
[16:15:17] <clondike> you need to use a buttload of \\s
[16:16:40] <clondike> waffl: http://jsfiddle.net/3RzXy/
[16:17:18] <clondike> TelFiRE: i would expect it to be the "last" in DOM order
[16:17:24] <waffl> clondike: agh, of course. thank you. :)
[16:17:25] <clondike> since jquery almost always follows DOM order
[16:17:59] <TelFiRE> clondike: yeah that was what I was thinking :/ must be doing something else wrong
[16:18:39] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I was trying to work this out before but I had to go. Anybody know why this form is still submitting and refreshing the page? http://pastebin.com/GZ3brfLq
[16:18:46] <DeltaHeavy> HTML and JS included
[16:22:01] <vespakoen> Hey peoples, does anyone know a good jQuery plugin that act as a facade for forms, I basically want to jam in a big array and have it autofill / check / select my fields
[16:22:10] <vespakoen> array = object
[16:22:41] <vespakoen> thinking about it, what I am looking for is a "populator", I'll give that a google
[16:24:35] <clondike> DeltaHeavy: you don't seem to have an element that matches $('#login')
[16:24:45] <clondike> maybe you want to add id="login" to the <form> ?
[16:25:02] <DeltaHeavy> Crap, I see it now. Used 'name' instead of 'id'. Thanks
[16:25:14] <clondike> or change the selector to $('form[name="login"]')
[16:26:12] <clondike> vespakoen: i haven't seen any plugins that do that for you (not saying they don't exist!). i would kind of roll my own with a templating plugin like underscore
[16:27:50] <vespakoen> populate was right on the money btw, exactly what I was looking for
[16:27:59] <vespakoen> uhh, a plugin named "populate"
[17:01:17] <docmur> If a post isn't being executed everytime what would be the most likely cause, I'm sure there is a timming issue buit beyond that I can't figure it out
[17:05:48] <docmur> Is it possible to tie a javascript file to a small div, I have multiple bars on my webpage and I have everything right now in one file buit I'm having timing issues.  Can I assume smaller files to each div and then in theory reduce my timing isues
[17:05:53] <docmur> my codew right now is http://jsfiddle.net/rEUBM/6/
[17:11:08] <MistuhKurtz> what are your timing issues docmur?
[17:12:06] <docmur> well some of the $.post() calls aren't always responding.  So I think I might have to much javascript or really bad long javascript in one file, the code http://jsfiddle.net/rEUBM/6/  seems to be sluggy and not responsive.
[17:12:58] <MistuhKurtz> docmur, the issue is not related to download time for your javascript file
[17:13:34] <spiderworm> strange thing with jquery cross-domain posts and CORSâ€¦ when i set up a POST, if i include the authorization header, it issues a preflight request (which it should do), but the headers only contain the OPTIONS https://my/url/here HTTP/1.1 line, and of course it fails
[17:14:42] <spiderworm> to test i created my own equivalent XMLHttpRequest object, set the authorization header, and the preflight request looked totally normal, and it passed. any thoughts what could be happening here?
[17:14:58] <docmur> Well i don't know what else it could be, maybe bad javascript or calling bad headers or something, I call jquery and jquery UI.
[17:17:01] <spiderworm> does jquery's ajax crossDomain setting need to be true for cross origin requests that aren't cross domain?
[17:19:14] <docmur> What is the best way to go about debugging what my issue could be?
[17:19:15] <granden> Could I compare two jquery objects and see if they are the same?
[17:19:24] <wookiehangover> no
[17:19:32] <wookiehangover> because they're instances
[17:19:36] <wookiehangover> and they're not the same
[17:19:36] <granden> ok
[17:19:57] <wookiehangover> ?is
[17:19:59] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[17:20:21] <granden> But acctually I just want to compare if the html is the same, so I could compare them after doing .html() then with a normal ==?
[17:20:26] <wookiehangover> but that's probably what you're looking for
[17:20:32] <granden> ah
[17:21:02] <wookiehangover> so 'is' will just match against the selector
[17:21:17] <wookiehangover> but comparing the html is fine
[17:27:43] <MistuhKurtz> docmur, if you're trying to work off of jsfiddle you need to use their AJAX api
[17:27:50] <MistuhKurtz> ?sop @ docmur
[17:27:50] <bot-t> docmur, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[17:28:13] <MistuhKurtz> docmur, I would also work on isolating the probelm
[17:29:12] <docmur> I'm trying to isolate the issue, I have the js file open in front of me in phpstorm The issues make no sense, because all the action should be triggering off submit buttons but they seem to now always execute
[17:30:00] <docmur> I don't understand how it can work on minute and not work the next
[17:32:18] <docmur> If having post calls inside callbacks bad?
[17:32:21] <docmur> *is
[17:34:17] <chare> what is the difference between using a table for layout vs divs and spans for layout
[17:36:57] <C8H10N4O2> I am trying to do a simple check all checkboxes / uncheck all checkboxes.  For some reason it is not working
[17:37:13] <spiderworm> when i execute this it generates a faulty CORS preflight request: (function() { $.ajax({ url: 'https://' + document.domain, method: 'POST', headers: { Authorization: 'test' }, success: function(text) { console.info(text); } }); })();
[17:37:43] <Blaster> hey guys, if I have a loop that does a bunch of concurrent AJAX requests, is there a way to fire a callback function when the last one completes?  I tried creating an iteration counter but it's not always the last request that finishes last.
[17:37:50] <clondike> chare: tables will let you get your site done more quickly
[17:37:56] <spiderworm> however, if i stick with the standard javascript syntax for the same operation, the preflight request is correct: (function() { x = new XMLHttpRequest(); x.open('POST','https://' + document.domain,false); x.onreadystatechange = function() { if(x.readyState === 4) console.info(x.responseText); }; x.setRequestHeader('Authorization', "test"); x.send(''); })();
[17:38:12] <spiderworm> any thoughts or ideas?
[17:38:56] <chare> ok next question how would i achieve the text highlighting shown in http://www.chessbase.com/news/2008/rybka03.jpg
[17:38:59] <chare> in html
[17:39:03] <chare> and css
[17:40:03] <clondike> chare: you google for "css chessboard" and find results like http://designindevelopment.com/css/css3-chess-board/
[17:40:37] <chare> clondike nonono not the chessboard, i mean the text
[17:40:58] <richardjortega> looking for any ajax tutorials on how to check if a user's email is inside the database already (in the case of user registration)? any examples?
[17:41:16] <clondike> maybe you want to read a css tutorial, chare ? there's quite a lot going on there
[17:41:26] <clondike> you might also like to take it to ##css
[17:41:50] <chare> clondike so you know the answer?
[17:42:19] <docmur> Doesn't doing this: $('#userBar button').bind('click'); make a button clickable aka I can call later in the file $('#userBar button').click(function(){}); Because when I take that second call outside of the call back the button is now longer triggering an action
[17:42:23] <clondike> i'm not sure there is a single answer. it's using a bunch of different CSS properties
[17:43:23] <clondike> chare: the highlighting is probably .highlight {background-color: #000; color: #fff;}
[17:43:39] <clondike> then <span class="highlight">some highlighted text</span>
[17:44:18] <chare> clondike if i want to cause javascript to run on clicking each text element how do i do that? is each text element wrapped in a div or something and the div has a click listener attached?
[17:44:40] <clondike> yes
[17:44:45] <clondike> more likely a span than a div
[17:46:54] <chrisv-nyc> hello. i have a problem with the jquery .css() method causing IE8 to scroll to top of page when creating absolute position values.
[17:47:26] <chrisv-nyc> i try to show a child panel when a span is clicked using this code: $childPanel.css({'left':relativeX+'px','top':relativeY+'px',display:'inline-block'});
[17:47:35] <chrisv-nyc> in chrome and FF it works perfectly
[17:47:59] <chrisv-nyc> in ie8, the page "jumps" to the top and i want to prevent the page from jumping to the top.
[17:48:06] <chrisv-nyc> any suggestions?
[17:49:52] <clondike> chrisv-nyc: this is a long shot but what if you have a .absolute {position: absolute} class and try addClass('absolute') instead of css()ing it
[17:50:05] <docmur> Beside $.ajax, $.load, $.get and $.post which seem to have completely non predictabe repsonse is there another way to send data to the "server side" such that I will always produce the proper output.
[17:50:05] <clondike> still need the CSS for the positions, obvs
[17:50:15] <spiderworm> created a ticket, if anyone's able to help: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12698
[17:50:57] <clondike> docmur: jQuery's ajax methods are not generally considered to be unpredictable :\ i get a lot of work done with them
[17:51:54] <docmur> my php is fine, my data serialization is fine as I alert it before all the $.post calls but when I move my project from my localbox to the dev site I get completely random behavor from $.post, $.load and $.ajax
[17:52:18] <chrisv-nyc> @clondike: thanks for the suggestion
[17:52:21] <docmur> It's the only issue I seem to have
[17:52:37] <chrisv-nyc> the only problem is the "left" and "top" values are dynamic
[17:52:43] <clondike> docmur: i wasn't paying attention, what do you mean by random?
[17:52:47] <HarryPitfall> anyone knows why IE is so dumb with $.ajax?
[17:52:55] <chrisv-nyc> how would those be added in?
[17:52:58] <clondike> the only random factor will be the time over the network
[17:53:29] <HarryPitfall> I'm using $.ajax, with dataType: 'html', to retrieve a html fragment, and IE gets "error" all the time... until I've changed the content-type to text/plain on server side
[17:53:30] <clondike> chrisv-nyc: $childPanel.css({'left':relativeX+'px','top':relativeY+'px'}).addClass('inline_block_class');
[17:53:38] <clondike> chrisv-nyc: $childPanel.css({'left':relativeX+'px','top':relativeY+'px'}).addClass('absolute_class');
[17:53:40] <docmur> Actually I can show you what I mean in a minute
[17:53:42] <clondike> something like that
[17:54:20] <clondike> HarryPitfall: what do you mean "gets error"?
[17:54:38] <HarryPitfall> the error status is just "error"
[17:54:50] <HarryPitfall> error: function(xhr, status) ... alert(status)
[17:54:56] <HarryPitfall> just 'error'
[17:56:57] <docmur> If you log into this site: http://andrewreg.dev1.naccvp.com/index.php with username docmur222@yahoo.ca and password: wanttoprint, you'll see what I mean, you can click the action buttons and toggle options then submit them and they wont alway happen, or if you use the update link at the top it wont alway update th mysql record.  I just made this account as a test
[17:56:59] <clondike> well fuck you and fuck your problem, HarryQuitFall
[17:59:07] <docmur> I can post the javascript to jsfiddle if it would helpo
[17:59:12] <docmur> I'm jsut out of ideas on what to try / test
[17:59:16] <docmur> like completely lost
[17:59:36] <clondike> docmur: alert() is not your friend because it locks the browser until you hit OK
[17:59:43] <clondike> which probably isn't helping
[17:59:45] <clondike> ?alert
[17:59:45] <bot-t> Forget alertâ€”use console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâ€™s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[18:00:57] <docmur> I'm only using alert to prove to myself that my program is hitting the points I need it to
[18:01:13] <chrisv-nyc> yeah, that didn't work: (
[18:01:41] <clondike> told you it was a long shot, chrisv-nyc
[18:01:42] <granden> does anyone got a working ajax/autorefresh twitter-feed plugin? would like to show the last 10 tweets from a centairt user account on twitter.
[18:01:43] <clondike> sorry about that
[18:02:36] <clondike> docmur: probably not related but i prefer to provide data as an object and let jQuery turn it into a query string instead of building it myself
[18:02:57] <clondike> data: {somekey: 'someVal', someotherkey: some_var_value, ...}
[18:03:25] <clondike> docmur: i would also use on() to delegate my event handling instead of rebinding in every load() callback
[18:03:25] <docmur> okay, well any suggestions would be well recieved, I'm game to try anything
[18:03:46] <clondike> those two changes would reduce the amount of code you need to look at
[18:04:20] <docmur> Okay, would it be likely to fix the issue I'm getting?  I'm just assuming the issue has to do with latentcy
[18:05:12] <clondike> docmur: you might be seeing a caching problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/168963/stop-jquery-load-response-from-being-cached
[18:05:45] <clondike> personally i would try the changes i suggested in case that shakes the bugs out. and if it doesn't it should make diagnosis simpler
[18:05:51] <clondike> also try disabling the caching
[18:06:01] <docmur> :-) okay
[18:06:05] <clondike> good luck buddy!
[18:06:16] <docmur> Thanks!!! :-)
[18:11:20] <docmur> would .ready() be better then .load()?
[18:11:24] <Blaster> is there a way to tell when a bunch of synchronous AJAX requests complete?  I have a loop that creates them, and I'm not sure how to tell once they're all completed
[18:11:48] <clondike> no docmur, they do different things
[18:11:55] <clondike> chrisv-nyc: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477834/div-with-scroll-and-content-with-absolute-positions ?
[18:12:54] <jaggz-> anyone know a number-picker (slider), like you might use on a touchscreen to pick a day of the month?
[18:15:14] <clondike> so... not something like this jaggz-  http://www.html5tutorial.info/html5-number.php ?
[18:15:47] <jaggz-> thanks.. nah.. the little up/down things aren't convenient on mobile
[18:16:27] <jaggz-> something more like this http://plainoldstan.blogspot.com/2010/10/random-notes-on-android-keyboard-and.html
[18:17:45] <jaggz-> something like this, for time.. in reality I'd like more compact: http://misha.beshkin.lv/custom-datepicker-for-android/
[18:17:56] <jaggz-> it's best to grab and drag it I think
[18:18:24] <jaggz-> but I'm trying cordova (phonegap) instead of straight android
[18:18:36] <clondike> jaggz-: when i open that page on my smartphone i get a little keypad popup in the browser
[18:18:37] <jaggz-> so .. it's HTML.. and I'm trying jquery + jquery mobile to make life easier
[18:18:42] <jaggz-> hey mfoxdogg|work
[18:18:49] <clondike> which is pretty convenient
[18:19:30] <jaggz-> that's interesting.. I wonder how to send a URL to my phone to check that out easily.. maybe google voice
[18:19:49] <ShawnRisk> I have this code: http://pastebin.com/ZKB7S7Wh that is suppose to change the slide based on the image button I push but right now goes to example.com/[object%20HTMLLIElement] not sure what I am doing wrong.  Any ideas?
[18:21:29] <clondike> jaggz-: i used http://bit.ly/PCiAID
[18:23:39] <jaggz-> clondike, that's cool too
[18:24:15] <jaggz-> also, if you use a shell, you can do echo 'message or url or whatever' | mail    to send it to your mobile provider's phone number for you
[18:24:45] <clondike> neat!
[18:25:00] <jaggz-> you can look up your number for emailing yourself
[18:25:23] <jaggz-> actually, I mean your mobile provider.. the number is your number...
[18:25:50] <clondike> ja i follow
[18:29:11] <jaggz-> maybe I should just type it in.. sigh.
[18:29:47] <jaggz-> 4<space>30a  -->  [ 4] [30] [am]
[18:32:30] <jaggz-> oh.. this is a good idea.. click the field and get a popup .. http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-DateBox/
[18:34:57] <clondike> aye that's very handsome
[18:37:18] <chare> clondike if i wrap each text element in a span how do i get spacing between the spans, what is the difference between using padding vs margin
[18:38:49] <clondike> padding is INSIDE the element, margin is OUTSIDE
[18:38:56] <clondike> it visually makes little difference
[18:38:58] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my question?
[18:39:04] <clondike> try adding a boreder to see the diff
[18:40:26] <clondike> ShawnRisk: it seems you're setting the href to some jQuery element
[18:40:32] <clondike> you probably want something else
[18:40:41] <clondike> slide[index].attr('href') or something?
[18:42:18] <chare> clondike if your element has no border than padding and margin create exactly the same effect?
[18:43:28] <ShawnRisk> clondike: This points back to the homepage and not the slide.
[18:44:38] <docmur> so I changed over to use on and disabled cache. . So If I add a form as a child to a Div called userBar and then in that form add a button called actionCancel so userBar->form->actionCanel, how to do I want actionCancel?
[18:45:20] <docmur> *watch actionCancel
[18:46:02] <clondike> ShawnRisk: why do you need to set a new href then? why not just href="/homepage" or w/e in the original html?
[18:46:38] <clondike> chare: it also effects where you need to "click" or "hover" over an element. padding is clickable, margin isn't
[18:46:46] <clondike> as in if you click on the margin it's ignored
[18:47:37] <clondike> docmur: $(document).on('click', 'actionCancel', function () {alert('cliqd');});
[18:47:48] <clondike> something like that anyway
[18:47:51] <ShawnRisk> clondike: because I don't want this to be going back to the homepage but going to the slide of the slideshow.  If someone clicks button 3 that goes to slide 3 of he slideshow.
[18:49:58] <clondike> in that case ShawnRisk i wouldn't be setting the href at all
[18:50:02] <clondike> i don't think
[18:50:12] <clondike> it depends on the slideshow code and how it works
[18:50:24] <felipe_Brz> could anybody tell me why I can't seem to attach a listener to my button's 'ready' event? http://jsfiddle.net/YcD6M/
[18:52:06] <ShawnRisk> clondike: do you want to see all the slideshow code?
[18:52:12] <clondike> i don't think individual elements have a "ready", felipe_Brz
[18:52:21] <clondike> what are you trying to achieve?
[18:52:26] <clondike> ShawnRisk: sure
[18:52:54] <felipe_Brz> i'm trying to call a function as soon as my button is ready
[18:52:59] <docmur> I changed over to this: http://jsfiddle.net/rEUBM/8/  maybe that was wrong?
[18:53:03] <felipe_Brz> rather than having to wait for the whole document to be ready
[18:53:26] <ShawnRisk> clondike: code: http://pastebin.com/uyLGRvJg  Do you understand what I am doing?
[18:53:36] <clondike> that doesn't work, felipe_Brz
[18:53:40] <ShawnRisk> clondike: and what I want to do?
[18:53:51] <clondike> readyness is a document state, not an element state
[18:54:46] <clondike> i think so, ShawnRisk
[18:54:51] <clondike> this is nicely commented
[18:55:09] <ShawnRisk> clondike: thanks
[18:55:16] <felipe_Brz> clondike:  is there any event to account for when an element is ready? i tried 'load' too but didn't work either
[18:56:10] <felipe_Brz> clondike:  like when we call live()
[18:56:41] <chare> clondike: why does the padding not effect the spacing with elements below (it seems like the line-height overrides that?)
[18:59:06] <clondike> i would try something like this, ShawnRisk http://pastebin.com/eTnk7C0N
[18:59:24] <clondike> felipe_Brz: i don't think there are per-element ready events
[18:59:33] <clondike> it would slow the browser down to have to notify for each element
[18:59:43] <clondike> you might be thinking of the onload for an image
[18:59:54] <clondike> but that's different because the image is loaded externally
[19:00:25] <clondike> felipe_Brz: if you're wanting to make sure someone can click an element as soon as it appears on screen i would use delegate or something
[19:00:52] <clondike> and on that bombshell i'm invited to lunch by a comely maiden. good luck!
[19:01:06] <felipe_Brz> clondike:  i'm not that's what I want... it's just that some of my styling is done via javascript
[19:01:25] <felipe_Brz> and if I wait for the whole document to be loaded before I start styling my element, I get ugly results
[19:01:32] <felipe_Brz> like users seeing them before and after
[19:01:34] <felipe_Brz> oh ok
[19:05:16] <ShawnRisk> clondike: this just refreshes the page as I think the url is the front page.
[19:05:55] <ShawnRisk> clondike: you see line 15 where the a href=""?
[19:11:34] <docmur> Sorry to keep bugging the room but now I'm confused so I want to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/rEUBM/9/  But I never see the alert so cancel must not be getting called
[19:11:34] <chare> clondike http://jsfiddle.net/bqK8u/2/
[19:11:39] <chare> explain the lack of vertical spaning
[19:11:58] <ShawnRisk> I think clondike is gone
[19:12:07] <chare> FUCK
[19:12:30] <chare> shawnrisk you volunteered to answer my question
[19:12:53] <ShawnRisk> docmur: a real example would be nice if you are using jsfiddl
[19:12:55] <ShawnRisk> jsfiddle
[19:13:33] <ShawnRisk> chare: I don't even know what you are doing the jsfiddle tells me nothing
[19:14:01] <chare> why is there no vertical spacing between the two lines
[19:14:12] <chare> even though i specify padding
[19:16:18] <ShawnRisk> chare: this is a css question not jquery
[19:16:32] <chare> JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION
[19:17:30] <ShawnRisk> chare: because you are using two different divs and not have a class on the first one but the elements within.
[19:18:01] <ShawnRisk> chare: why are you mad?
[19:18:45] <chare> explain why doesn't the padding effect the height of the first div
[19:19:09] <docmur> here is a semi working example: http://jsfiddle.net/rEUBM/22/
[19:19:23] <ShawnRisk> chare: I just did because you are adding padding to the elements within the div but not the div itself
[19:19:29] <ShawnRisk> chare: this is a css question
[19:19:40] <chare> wtf the div doesn't autosize itself to its content?
[19:20:00] <ShawnRisk> why would it?
[19:20:12] <chare> ok whats the definition of how div's are suppose to behave
[19:20:55] <ShawnRisk> docmur: works for me in Chrome, when I click the button I see alert and can click cancel
[19:21:14] <docmur> right but when you click cancel you should get another alert which I don't get
[19:21:14] <ShawnRisk> chare: stop, this is not jquery questions.
[19:22:07] <chare> shawnrisk you're a css expert just answer my qusetions
[19:22:29] <docmur> go to CSS if you want a CSS question answered
[19:23:25] <ShawnRisk> chare: who says I am a CSS expert I never said that
[19:23:39] <chare> shawnrisk JUST ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE
[19:24:19] <ShawnRisk> chare: I am not answering anymore questions that are not jquery in this room
[19:29:40] <ShawnRisk> docmur: I am not sure, if I change any of the code it says {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[19:30:13] <docmur> This is a better example: http://jsfiddle.net/rEUBM/29/  Now the button doesn't have a default submit and I can't hide the Action box
[19:34:55] <ShawnRisk> docmur: if I do $('#userBarAction').on('click', 'button', function(event) this works for all buttons but no hiding.
[19:36:54] <docmur> Well ya that works but now I'm super confused as to why I don't need to put $('$userBarAction button') to tell jQuery that button is a child of that box
[19:38:43] <ShawnRisk> docmur: looking into this
[19:45:47] <ShawnRisk> docmur: try this: $('#userBarAction').on('click', 'button#actionCancel', function(event) {
[19:45:58] <phonebook_> hi jquery i come in peace (for now)
[19:47:14] <tw2113> as opposed to pieces phonebook_ ?
[19:47:21] <ShawnRisk> hi tw2113
[19:47:35] <tw2113> yo
[19:47:43] <phonebook_> it turns out i dont know everything. im asking in jquery becuase the ultimate solution seems like a jquery solution. i'd like a list of available fonts (like in a graphics editor) via a jquery plugin. i just learned about this css http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_font-face_rule.asp
[19:48:22] <phonebook_> tw2113, all of the above, apparantly im a a complte jackass
[19:48:30] <phonebook_> but i can make valid points sometimes
[19:48:46] <tw2113> i just met you so i can't confirm or deny
[19:48:53] <phonebook_> i am
[19:48:56] <phonebook_> anyway
[19:50:08] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: Code: http://pastebin.com/eTnk7C0N  I am trying to make buttons for a slideshow clickable so when you click button 3 that goes to slide 3.  Right now all that happens is the front page reloads instead of going to the correct slide.  I believe this has something to do with line 15.
[19:50:44] <tw2113> *shrug* i'm not good at writing my own sliders
[19:50:48] <tw2113> i just use pre-built ones
[19:51:03] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: not even helping me with my code?
[19:51:21] <phonebook_> if i wrote the solution i would be a jquery god?
[19:51:26] <tw2113> well i know when there is likelihood of knowing an answer :P
[19:51:38] <tw2113> and i know in this case, i don't have one
[19:51:44] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: okay
[19:51:51] <tw2113> i couldn't tell you how to wrap around to slide 1 again :D
[19:52:06] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: pardon?
[19:52:21] <tw2113> ah, misread
[19:53:03] <tw2113> have you tried preventDefault ?
[19:53:20] * phonebook_ imagines him or herself as a jquery god. what would it be like?
[19:53:26] <tw2113> also jsfiddles are great in this room, as opposed to pastebin
[19:53:37] <tw2113> lonely phonebook_
[19:54:18] <phonebook_> dont go all exisential on us or we will boot you
[19:54:25] <tw2113> bring it
[19:54:26] <phonebook_> anyway
[19:54:43] <phonebook_> i cant boot anyone
[19:55:14] <phonebook_> nor would i
[19:55:32] <phonebook_> anyway, maybe ill add that idea to the queue
[19:55:43] <ShawnRisk> tw2113: I did and this doesn't help out, as far as I know.
[20:02:27] <ShawnRisk> docmur: did that work?
[20:03:04] <docmur> that works but my posts are still broken and I have no idea why, I can alert the data before the post but then it seems as if my script will never actually do the post action
[20:03:53] <docmur> This is the full code http://jsfiddle.net/rEUBM/36/ and the userBarAction submit and update submit never seem to actually post
[20:03:58] <ShawnRisk> docmur: do you have the post action?
[20:04:57] <ShawnRisk> docmur: not working solution
[20:05:15] <ShawnRisk> docmur: can you look at my question?
[20:05:34] <docmur> the button#id works
[20:05:39] <docmur> the buttons trigger correctly
[20:05:55] <tw2113> ShawnRisk after running it through a real text editor and doing some indenting/bracket matching, it looks like you have a function declared in a function
[20:06:09] <tw2113> which i'm doubtful is valid
[20:07:28] <docmur> i can see the post in the web console on firefox if that is what your askingf
[20:15:17] <docmur> I'm calling it quits for tonight but thanks for your help :-)
[20:20:00] <clondike> bye forever, docmur
[20:43:28] <rgenito> herrro
[20:45:32] <rgenito> how can i tell if a div is visible?
[20:45:51] <rgenito> (besides checking the value for .css('display'))
[20:46:03] <rgenito> is there something like... div.isVisible() ? div.visible() ?
[20:48:02] <clondike> .is(':visible')
[20:48:09] <clondike> ?:visible
[20:48:11] <bot-t> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[20:48:13] <clondike> ?is
[20:48:14] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[20:48:18] <clondike> thanks bot-t
[20:48:19] <bot-t> ;)
[20:48:44] <rgenito> ah
[20:49:27] <rgenito> i see... so  .... .is(element).visible ?
[20:49:41] <tw2113> ?visible
[20:49:41] <bot-t> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[20:49:55] <elrond255> if you remove an element from the DOM are you also removing the children? Is there a way to just move an element up the DOM and then just delete the empty elements?
[20:50:12] <clondike> $('div').is(':visible')
[20:50:15] <rgenito> elrond255, good question, i'm gunna stick around and listen :)
[20:50:16] <clondike> pay attention
[20:50:18] <rgenito> tw2113, whuazhaaa
[20:50:44] <clondike> it removes all the children, elrond255
[20:50:46] <clondike> i'm sorry
[20:50:53] <clondike> jQuery doesn't approve of orphans
[20:50:58] <clondike> better the entire family perish together
[20:51:19] <tw2113> grab the kids into a var, destroy the parents, readd the kids?
[20:51:28] <rgenito> welp, now i'm playing hide-n-go-seek with a div. hah.
[20:51:31] <tw2113> in a new dom
[20:51:41] <clondike> a brave new dom
[20:51:58] <rgenito> oh holy crap
[20:52:16] <rgenito> i wonder how the heck the div went to position.... top 1300, left 2200 @_@
[20:52:25] <elrond255> and then reattach the var to the dom where you need itâ€¦ that sounds like it's doable without major headaches
[20:53:05] <clondike> fun fact: $('#some_elem').appendTo('#somewhere_else') moves the whole thing in a single step
[20:53:12] <Palanivel> hi gud morning
[20:53:46] <rgenito> oooo
[20:53:53] <elrond255> thank you clondike

[20:54:16] <elrond255> wonder the same thing
[20:54:46] <Palanivel> small concept but am not getting...... i want to setinterval 20 min then after 20 min to trigger one function if any function called want to clear the  time
[20:55:08] <Palanivel> am no get...if any one have idea.let me  know
[20:55:40] <clondike> so any of the functions which can cancel the timeOut need to uh... cancel the timeout
[20:55:44] <clondike> with clearTimeout()

[21:32:39] <Palanivel> @clondike......when ever am clicking button want to reset the time
[21:32:44] <Palanivel> am idea
[21:33:06] <Palanivel> clearInterval()

[21:34:23] <tw2113> ChrisYuki, http://jsfiddle.net/bjF3w/4/
[21:34:27] <ChrisYuki> Neat! Can you explain the selector? This was my first jquery script, so I am still very new. I want ot learn though.
[21:34:54] <tw2113> damn vladikoff beat me
[21:35:24] <vladikoff> ChrisYuki, http://api.jquery.com/all-selector/
[21:35:29] <ChrisYuki> His is more what I was looking for too, but thank you too tw2113!
[21:35:45] <tw2113> no mad
[21:37:22] <ChrisYuki> I get the #things...it seems I need to surround the stuff in div tags and give it an actual id (like things)... I just do not get the > bit.
[21:38:17] <vladikoff> ChrisYuki, ignore that
[21:39:03] <ChrisYuki> I need to understand it though o.O lol. If I just do #things, it would make everything hide, right? So I feel it is important.
[21:39:32] <vladikoff> ChrisYuki, http://jsfiddle.net/bjF3w/6/ you can do that
[21:40:04] <tw2113> #things * selects all of the children
[21:40:07] <vladikoff> ChrisYuki, or this http://jsfiddle.net/bjF3w/7/
[21:40:15] <tw2113> #things > * selects just the direct children of #things
[21:40:20] <tw2113> no grandkids
[21:41:02] <ChrisYuki> Ahhhh! I get it now. Thank you two a lot.
[21:42:36] <ChrisYuki> Alright, I shall go play with jquery a bit!
[21:42:41] <ChrisYuki> bye!
[21:44:47] <vladikoff> ChrisYuki, thanks for stopping by, good luck!
[22:10:03] <mouses> is swfobject still the standard for embeding youtube and vimeo cross-browser?
[22:10:40] <tw2113> sadly, last i knew
[22:11:21] <mouses> so its not even worth the hastle of using the embed code given by youtube and vimeo on their video's sites?
[22:11:27] <tw2113> actually, if you were using youtube/vimeo anyway?those aren't actually embedded files anyway
[22:11:35] <tw2113> just iframes that reference their API
[22:11:40] <mouses> i remember trying a couple years ago and i went through like 24 hours of debugging hell with IE
[22:11:52] <tw2113> use the iframe versions, it's your easiest bet
[22:11:54] <mouses> and then realized that the only option was to use swfobject
[22:11:59] <tw2113> my bad on mistaking that with swfobject
[22:12:11] <tw2113> 2 years ago is ancient in webdev
[22:12:39] <tw2113> iframes will do you fine
[22:12:41] <mouses> so people dont use swfobject anymore for embedding youtube?
[22:12:44] <mouses> hmm, ok
[22:13:27] <mouses> i use a mac and i dont have a windows partition anymore. is there some tool to allow me to test IE and not just screenshot results?
[22:14:18] <tw2113> http://browserstack.com/
[22:14:22] <tw2113> not free though
[22:14:44] <mouses> damn
[22:14:52] <tw2113> but it gives you a VM to run
[22:15:02] <tw2113> and a decent variety of devices + browsers + OS
[22:15:18] <tw2113> could likely make it worth the money
[22:15:19] <mouses> ok, i need free shit for now tho
[22:15:39] <phiz> mouses: you can use virtualbox and create a 5-10gb windows image without having to make another partition
[22:15:48] <phiz> it is free and you can get windows 8 for free right now as a beta
[22:16:00] <rgenito> man, jquery is awesome @_@
[22:16:06] <phiz> that's what i use on my mbp
[22:16:24] <tw2113> $19/mo isn't that much especially if you really use it
[22:17:09] <mouses> my site is simple tho
[22:17:23] <tw2113> no other sites through clients?
[22:17:24] <mouses> thanks phiz, i was looking for something more quick and easy tho
[22:17:37] <mouses> nope, i'm just creating a personal site for me
[22:17:50] <tw2113> mug someone for their windows laptop for a couple hours
[22:17:52] <mouses> if i was doing web dev for $, i would tho
[22:17:57] <tw2113> then give it back and apologize
[22:18:14] <mouses> my old dell laptop died
[22:18:17] <tw2113> you'll know the windows laptops by the lack of glowing apple
[22:20:01] <phiz> mouses: well, it would probably take about an hour to install win8, it is pretty quick actually
[22:20:39] <mouses> i was hoping for more of a free web based emulator
[22:20:52] <mouses> without registering login
[22:20:58] <phiz> mouses: unfortunately there is easy and $19 or 1 hour of time and free :-P
[22:21:08] <mouses> lol
[22:21:20] <phiz> browsershots.org is what i used to use
[22:21:23] <phiz> but it is just a screenshot
[22:21:47] <mouses> so you guys have no issues embedding youtube and vimeo nowadays cross-browser, without using swfobject?
[22:21:56] <tw2113> i say make IE users bend over and just take whatever you give them
[22:22:17] <tw2113> you're worrying too much about that
[22:22:18] <tw2113> :D
[22:22:23] <tw2113> iframes work for that
[22:22:27] <tw2113> accept it and be happy
[22:23:24] <phiz> i agree w/ tw2113
[22:25:07] <clondike> i prefer not to embed videos at all. if i want my visitors to see a video i will send them a VHS or DVD
[22:25:59] <tw2113> you moved up from betamax
[22:26:29] <clondike> i would send betamax to IE users i guess
[22:26:35] <clondike> or 16 mm
[22:27:26] <faraway> clondike: don't forget to send them a printed version of the webpage
[22:29:15] <tw2113> on parchment
[22:31:04] <faraway> i wouldn't suggest parchment that doesn't work well if i put a cup with coffee on it.
[22:39:08] <clondike> thanks for your advice, i will action those items immediately
[22:40:25] <tw2113> here's coldhead lately?
[22:42:00] <tw2113> where's*
[22:45:57] <w00tner> i went to pick up his cousin beacause aunt flora couldnt make it
[22:46:04] <w00tner> he*
[22:57:54] <chare> what is the idiomatic syntax to do a tree structure in coffeescript
[22:58:47] <clondike> the idiomatic place to ask is in #coffeescript
[22:59:01] <shoky> what an idiomatic response..
[22:59:36] <chare> clondike: friend please just answer me
[23:00:01] <clondike> i am ignorant of the answer, i am sorry
[23:00:10] <clondike> but i bet someone in #coffeescript will know
[23:00:21] <clondike> people in #jQuery aren't usually smart enough for coffeescript
[23:01:45] <chare> clondike i know you have the answer
[23:01:50] <chare> stop hiding it
[23:02:23] <clondike> it's my first day using coffeescript
[23:02:55] <clondike> how about something like this maybe? http://hectorcorrea.com/blog/Drawing-a-Binary-Tree-in-CoffeeScript
[23:03:24] <faraway> clondike: psst .. thats the first result in google .. thats a secret
[23:04:17] <clondike> i am deeply ashamed
[23:06:24] <chare> guys you know i don't use google
[23:06:29] <chare> i'm spoiled and dependent

[23:15:19] <EmmaJ> bye byeee
[23:20:10] <advorak> Is there a plugin of sorts that will flow text from one div to another?  I have a large block of text and, when the text exceeds a certain heigh (presumably of the div), it will flow onto a new div .. (Kindof like how pages are perceived in google docs.  I'm probably not being too clear … :-P
[23:24:04] <Cork> advorak: no, you would have to structure your text to make that work
[23:24:22] <Cork> advorak: like adding your paragraphs in <p> tags
[23:24:23] <advorak> Cork, thanks.
[23:24:52] <Cork> advorak: else you would have to calculate the size of the text each and every time, and thats very expensive
[23:25:01] <advorak> *nods*
[23:25:34] <Cork> (copy the text to a hidden div, grab the height of the div, calculate based on that height, loop)
[23:26:53] <advorak> Well fortunately I don't /require/ the divs to be all *exactly* the same size, as you might need in, say, google docs, so maybe I'm best to just approximate this and have the server parse the text spit them out as separate divs..
[23:30:00] <Lost123> how can show data or progress on a scale of 1 to 10 using jquery? any plugins anyone knows of?
[23:30:28] <ShawnRisk> hi
[23:32:41] <usbar> Hi there. I have a form in the form of: <form id="form_id" action=""> <input type="checkbox" onclick="this.form.submit()"> [more checkboxes] </form> . So I am trying to filter a search whenever a user checks a checkbox So I try something like this wih jquery $("#form_id").on("submit", function(e){ e.preventDefault() [..code to get the query..] }); the problem is that the jquery code doesn't get executed if I bind it to submit, only to click. But I ne
[23:32:48] <usbar> Thankx
[23:33:37] <faraway> advorak: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7400174/continuing-overflowed-text-in-a-different-div
[23:35:25] <faraway> advorak: you get problems if your text isn't plain, and has other html tags inside
[23:36:21] <faraway> advorak: i know i have somewhere a code snippet that nearly solved this problem, but don't ask me where ;)
[23:36:27] <advorak> faraway, understood.  Thanks.  That may prove helpful.  I was having trouble knowing what exactly to search for..
[23:39:04] <ShawnRisk> Code: http://pastebin.com/eTnk7C0NÂ  I am trying to make buttons for a slideshow clickable so when you click button 3 that goes to slide 3. Â Right now all that happens is the front page reloads instead of going to the correct slide. Â I believe this has something to do with line 15.
[23:43:36] <ShawnRisk> usbar: your text cut off
[23:43:55] <SethT> when did jqueryui 1.9 come out
[23:48:30] <Lost123> how can show data or progress on a scale of 1 to 10 using jquery? any plugins anyone knows of?
[23:49:45] <faraway> advorak: but the idea was similar ... passing the whole content into the first "div" then using  elementFromPoint (if supported by browser otherwise i used a fallback) then split the the content. (this is a little bit nasty if you have headline elements or many nested html elements). then passing the second part of the split into the next div and doing the same steps.
[23:50:14] <usbar>  
[23:50:14] <usbar>                e.preventDefault() [..code to get the query..] }); the problem is that the jquery code doesn't get executed if I bind it to submit, only to click. But
[23:50:18] <usbar>                I need it to bind it to submit, any ideas why is this happening?
[23:50:31] <usbar> ShawnRisk: I think thats the rest
[23:50:49] <faraway> Lost123: a progressbar ?
[23:51:17] <advorak> fortunately, my text doesn't require html to be within the content body and, in fact, it is going to be monospaced font..
[23:51:51] <faraway> advorak: then the snipped of stackoverflow could already work for you
[23:51:53] <Lost123> faraway: yes
[23:51:58] <faraway> Lost123: http://jqueryui.com/progressbar/ ?
[23:52:46] <Lost123> faraway: thanks, how can i show a slider on which i can set my progress by sliding it?
[23:52:58] <Lost123> like something in percentage or so
[23:53:07] <mytoz> what's a good general web dev channel?
[23:53:59] <faraway> Lost123: probably you find a slider there too ;)
[23:54:01] <mytoz> I'm having a problem with mobile Safari crashing when visiting a site hosted on different servers, but when I host it from my workstation and visit it with Mobile Safari, Safari doesn't crash.
[23:54:22] <mytoz> quite odd. I'm trying to pinpoint what could be different enough to cause Safari to crash, which is quite difficult.
[23:54:35] <mytoz> seeing as it should use pretty much the same amount of memory regardless of where it is hosted.
[23:54:55] <faraway> mytoz: does it crash instantly ?
[23:55:10] <ShawnRisk> faraway: any thoughts on mine?
[23:55:10] <mytoz> no, after a while. it loads a bunch of data using JSONP.
[23:55:26] <faraway> mytoz: which ios do oyu have ?
[23:55:26] <mytoz> I know it's bad, but it is designed that way and I was brought in to fix the crashing. new to the job etc. :)
[23:55:39] <mytoz> faraway: it's ios 5.1.1, in 6 it works well.
[23:56:11] <mytoz> I'm actually amazed it doesn't crash Safari when hosted on my workstation, heh.
[23:56:25] <faraway> mytoz: damn .. becaus in ios 6 you can cann connect mobile safari with desktops safaris console to see the output
[23:56:28] <Splat> I'm trying to have a checkbox change from unchecked to checked or the other way around based on data coming in to the page.. I have the data coming in but can't seem to work out the changing the status of a checkbox based on somethign else.. does anyone know of any tutorials or anything they can point me at that might help me get my head around it?
[23:56:59] <ShawnRisk> usbar: can you tell us how you binding this to submit and click?
[23:56:59] <mytoz> faraway: yeah, I know. quite annoying :)
[23:57:03] <jacobfogg> Can anyone tell me why: "var tmpLi = document.createElement('li'); tmpLi.itemValue = 11;" works in all browsers but the latest version of Firefox (version 16)?
[23:57:15] <jacobfogg>  It worked fine in FF15, but with the latest release of FF16, it breaks!
[23:57:25] <jacobfogg> "InvalidAccessError: A parameter or an operation is not supported by the underlying object"
[23:58:30] <mytoz> faraway: the crash logs doesn't say much except that safari tried to allocate memory it doesn't have access to.
