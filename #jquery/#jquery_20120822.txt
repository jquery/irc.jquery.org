[00:00:27] <Palanivel> @b-ot.............for what??
[00:00:58] <Eviltwin> 'someMember:SecondMember' should become 'some:SecondMember' or 'some:Second'?
[00:01:20] <Palanivel> some:Second
[00:01:46] <r500> $("input[@name='sl']:checked").val() should giv value of radio buton checked

[00:02:25] <Eviltwin> There
[00:02:27] <NaN> that's why I need to use next()
[00:03:19] <NaN> r500: no no, but I don't want the value of the radio, I want the value of the option selected next to
[00:03:46] <Palanivel> @Eviltwin........that's great........may i know what is mean about this (/Member/g, "")
[00:04:17] <Eviltwin> It means globally replace every "Member" with "" in the string

[01:00:21] <Solow> Usability question... I have a nice bar with about 5 buttons of options. You can "drag" these options on the page to extend its content. Now, when clicking on one of these options on the page (so not in the menu bar) I need to show some other options. The way I see it, I have 2 options: 1) Replace current options with new options, and revert when deselected. 2) Create a new bar for the new options.
[01:00:50] <Solow> I'd say "1" because I don't want to get too crowded. But perhaps there's a good reason not to go that way.
[01:01:26] <thebigkiwi> $('td.day').eq(new Date().getDay()).addClass('today'); somehow returns "3"
[01:01:50] <thebigkiwi> well, it applies .today on the 3, in my calendar
[01:02:17] <BinaryKitten> getDay returns day of the week

[01:48:19] <hirsty> hi all im using jquery 1.6 and im wondering why my datepicker is not showing up within a div
[01:55:28] <hirsty> -sigh- why do i bother ..
[01:57:47] <marcogmonteiro> hirsty well try being more specific with your questions...
[01:57:57] <marcogmonteiro> and show some code or something...
[01:58:30] <hirsty> i can only generalize it is commercial software that i am building
[01:59:24] <bigkevmcd> what is the actual question?
[01:59:26] <bigkevmcd> I see some musings...
[01:59:35] <hirsty> basically i am editing a page within an iframe and i need a datepicker that is within 2divs
[02:00:00] <bigkevmcd> and your question is?
[02:00:51] <hirsty> how would i go about displaying my datepicker within my secondary div as currently nothing will display
[02:01:11] <hirsty> it is currently attached to an input box class
[02:01:53] <bigkevmcd> hirsty: does the element you're hoping it'll attach to exist at the point you're executing the code, or are you using live ?
[02:05:20] <hirsty> it fully exists as if it didnt it wouldnt carry my POST data :D
[02:05:47] <hirsty> im at a stage where it is readuy to implement just adding a few features
[02:06:16] <NodeX> commercial software requires commercial support
[02:09:24] <mazzachre> Does anyone here use JsRender? I have a problem with the templates, if I add a linebreak somewhere (To make them more readable) then the templateengine fails with "unterminated line litteral" what to do?
[02:13:37] <Anticom> hi all
[02:14:19] <Anticom> i've got a button which i replace with another on click to kind of hint the user if he's realy sure to perform that action... now i want the button to move back to it's original state afer a few seconds. somehow i didn't get it to work http://jsfiddle.net/3Qd4F/
[02:16:43] <nFFF> Guys I got an issue, in chrome/firefox all javascript works fine, however in IE 9 nothing: http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/stealth/
[02:16:53] <nFFF> Any insights?
[02:17:11] <Anticom> that's because IE sucks ;)
[02:18:10] <sicp> the website is very slow
[02:18:40] <ua741> when writing $allTheLinks.each(function(index,value){
[02:18:41] <ua741> 	($(value).attr('href','/life'+$(value).attr('href')));
[02:18:41] <ua741> 	
[02:18:41] <ua741> });
[02:18:52] <ua741> Why do I need to put $ sign before valiue?
[02:19:19] <nFFF> sicp, probably to do with the 116 requests :d
[02:25:23] <Anticom> ua741 because value probably refers to a "regular" dom element and those haven't got jq-functions
[02:25:36] <Anticom> wrapping it in the dollar function converts it to a jq object
[02:25:52] <Anticom> oh and one more thing: use jsfiddle and don't paste your code here
[02:26:42] <ua741> Anticom, yeah sorry. I posted  code here  in hurry. Is there any reason why it is not typecasted implicity?
[02:27:11] <ua741> wait, I think I got it. It would be stupid to do so.
[02:27:13] <ua741> Thanks :)
[02:27:36] <Anticom> just do console.log(value) to see wether it's a jq object or a dom reference
[02:27:45] <Anticom> you'll see that it points to a dom reference
[02:27:56] <Anticom> that's why you have to convert first to use jq methods on it
[02:29:42] <trueicecold> Hello all
[02:29:50] <trueicecold> anyone free for an $.ajax question?
[02:29:55] <trueicecold> I'm desperate...
[02:30:14] <nFFF> just ask...
[02:30:47] <trueicecold> I'm creating a mobile web based application for a forum I'm a member in. It uses logging in with username/password to access specific forums.
[02:31:44] <trueicecold> thing is, after using $.ajax to login, and going to a "restricted unless registered" forum, it shows I'm not logged. I suspect it's cookies, and that different $.ajax calls don't use the same cookies between them.
[02:31:52] <trueicecold> Any way to achieve this?
[02:32:01] <blackspotwiggins> why do you need to use ajax to login?
[02:32:34] <trueicecold> what other way is there for a mobile web app?
[02:32:37] <trueicecold> post?
[02:32:53] <trueicecold> post uses the same ajax mechanism, no?
[02:33:01] <quicksilver> trueicecold: different $.ajax calls do not use different cookies, no
[02:33:10] <quicksilver> all requests to the same host use the same cookies
[02:33:11] <blackspotwiggins> if you dont need to use ajax, dont
[02:33:15] <quicksilver> ajax or otherwise
[02:33:19] <blackspotwiggins> regular forms work fine
[02:33:34] <blackspotwiggins> "mobile web app" is just another webpage
[02:33:42] <blackspotwiggins> you dont need to use ajax because it sounds cool
[02:33:46] <trueicecold> yes, but it's all local
[02:34:12] <trueicecold> no files on the server whatsoever
[02:34:30] <trueicecold> none to match my webapp, that it.
[02:34:54] <trueicecold> quicksilver: so you're basically saying I've got another problem, not related to cookies?
[02:35:03] <quicksilver> yes.
[02:35:28] <trueicecold> hm...
[02:35:29] <quicksilver> well, not I'm not
[02:35:45] <quicksilver> I'm saying that your suggestion that different $.ajax calls have different cookie jars is incorrect
[02:36:01] <quicksilver> however there *are* problems with ajax + cookies from smartphone apps
[02:36:06] <Solow> I have two "hover" events I'm attaching to. One element resides inside of the other. I want to add a class on hover, but only to the element I'm on. So when on the inner element, I don't want the outer to get the class. How do I do this?
[02:36:13] <quicksilver> basically this is because all smartphone OSes are shit, and badly documented, and don't work.
[02:36:29] <trueicecold> lol
[02:36:33] <quicksilver> I think I had this problem once on another project but I don't recall how we fixed it, sorry.
[02:36:38] <trueicecold> well, actually I think I just found the problem...
[02:36:43] <trueicecold> I normalize all links to posts
[02:36:50] <entrada> Solow: $(this).addClass
[02:36:51] <trueicecold> and private forums are handled sifferently, as it seems...
[02:36:58] <trueicecold> thanks a lot! :)
[02:37:01] <trueicecold> I'll check it out
[02:37:05] <Solow> entrada: Yes, but the hover of the parent also gets triggered.
[02:37:23] <entrada> Solow return false in the inner event handler
[02:37:30] <Solow> entrada: Which I want to either not trigger, or ignore when I'm hovering the child element.
[02:37:43] <Solow> entrada: But then how do I know I'm hovering a child
[02:37:49] <Solow> By storing it?
[02:37:57] <entrada> Solow: event.stopPropagation is more correct
[02:38:11] <entrada> Solow: either use two event handlers
[02:38:44] <entrada> Solow: or figure it out by checking whatever differentiates parent and child
[02:39:05] <Solow> entrada: Okay.
[02:39:09] <blackspotwiggins> trueicecold, you are doing ajax requests to localhost?
[02:39:15] <blackspotwiggins> why?
[02:39:33] <quicksilver> blackspotwiggins: no, he is doing ajax requests to a remote server
[02:39:45] <quicksilver> blackspotwiggins: from a smartphone app whose chrome consists of local pages
[02:39:45] <ravenzz> anyone familiar with masonry.js?
[02:39:46] <blackspotwiggins> <trueicecold> yes, but it's all local
[02:39:46] <blackspotwiggins> <trueicecold> no files on the server whatsoever
[02:39:58] <quicksilver> blackspotwiggins: right, local html+css+js, remote ajax
[02:40:02] <entrada> ravenzz: yes
[02:40:06] <quicksilver> a common design for web-based smartphone apps
[02:40:21] <quicksilver> like phonegap / cordova
[02:40:21] <blackspotwiggins> no shit it wont work then
[02:40:31] <quicksilver> it does work if you get the CORS set up correctly
[02:40:40] <quicksilver> and your OS isn't too badly broken
[02:40:47] <quicksilver> quite a lot of phone apps do work this way.
[02:40:52] <xertion> Hi guys, I have a input with id="quantitiy_wanted" and then I try to fetch the value with $('#quantity_wanted').val(). Default value of the input when page is refresh is 1. However, when I change to 10; .val() still return 1. Why is this? How do I make $('#quantity_wanted').val() update the value while I write something new in the <input>?
[02:41:19] <ravenzz> entrada do you know if the imagesLoaded will trigger masonry after the "itemSelector" images children are loaded?
[02:41:34] <ravenzz> or does it work only if the itemSelector is an image itself?
[02:41:38] <trueicecold> xertion how do you update it?
[02:41:44] <trueicecold> change the value*
[02:41:47] <trueicecold> using JS?
[02:42:44] <xertion> I just type a new value in the <input type="text">. I want the .val() to return the current value
[02:42:44] <trueicecold> in any case, val() shoud reflect the current value of the input. Is it possible you have 2 fields with the same name? JQuery will take the first one.
[02:42:46] <Anticom> why doesn't delay work here? http://jsfiddle.net/3Qd4F/1/
[02:42:47] <xertion> without having to submit it
[02:42:53] <xertion> Oh
[02:42:55] <xertion> I will look at that
[02:42:57] <xertion> if it's 2 fields
[02:42:59] <xertion> sec.
[02:43:20] <ravenzz> the thing is that I have a graph (an SVG) which is generated in a couple of seconds, so until it is not rendered its container height is less then the final one, and this mess everything up
[02:43:53] <ravenzz> of course if I specify a fixed height for the svg container it will work, but ...
[02:44:03] <ravenzz> I wouldn't do that
[02:44:41] <blackspotwiggins> trueicecold, quicksilver wouldn't it be better to use appcache and serve the page from the correct domain?
[02:44:51] <xertion> trueicecold: I do not have 2 fields with same id. However, the input has a default value="1". Is that why it's retrieving 1 even if I change it?
[02:45:50] <xertion> Oh, when I remove the value="" from the input, then my .val() returns nothing
[02:46:16] <xertion> So... how do I return the value that is currently written (but not submitted/updated page yet) in the input?
[02:51:50] <quicksilver> blackspotwiggins: soemtimes, maybe. However with local pages your webapp can work even when entirely offline.
[02:51:57] <sjeijk> guys if I write $("#wizard-form").formwizard({ â€¦ }); should it bind to elements I append later or should I run it again?
[02:52:05] <quicksilver> blackspotwiggins: and with local storage it can hold information it collected last time it was online.
[02:52:36] <blackspotwiggins> appcache works offline as well
[02:52:43] <blackspotwiggins> and ajax to remote requires connection anyway
[02:53:45] <trueicecold> blackspotwiggins: I don't have the full support of the admin, I'm making the app on my own initiative, so getting them to have files on their server could be a problem.
[02:54:14] <trueicecold> they know I'm creating it and happy about it, but not very cooperative...
[02:54:34] <sjeijk> anyone?
[02:55:50] <blackspotwiggins> trueicecold, native app would be easier then
[02:56:30] <trueicecold> yes but I need it for android/bb as well :)
[02:56:57] <blackspotwiggins> well. sucks to be you then
[02:57:04] <blackspotwiggins> they need to support it somehow
[02:57:15] <blackspotwiggins> either with cors or letting you host it on their server
[02:58:04] <trueicecold> I'm using cors=true for development
[02:58:27] <trueicecold> but what should they do to allow me access them nonetheless
[02:58:32] <trueicecold> when the app is offline?
[02:58:40] <blackspotwiggins> cors needs to be set serverside
[02:59:05] <blackspotwiggins> pray tell, how do you login to their forum offline
[02:59:59] <trueicecold> by using a proxy and mimicing the domain lol
[03:00:26] <blackspotwiggins> what?
[03:00:45] <Solow> entrada: stopPropagation worked.
[03:01:31] <trueicecold> you asked how I managed to login their forum from an offline file?
[03:03:29] <blackspotwiggins> nm
[03:03:32] <blackspotwiggins> ?gl
[03:03:35] <blackspotwiggins> ahh not bot
[03:03:39] <ak> is there some way, to detect if a div got some class changes? (like .on('class-change' ....
[03:12:25] <Solow> ak: Yes. I used to to that by frequently "checking"
[03:12:41] <Solow> ak: Like some sort of interval to check if the information has changed.
[03:12:53] <PlasmaBunny> hi
[03:12:58] <PlasmaBunny> does php have anything more accurate than microtime() ?
[03:13:54] <Solow> PlasmaBunny: microtime(true)
[03:13:55] <Solow> lol
[03:14:20] <PlasmaBunny> no.
[03:14:23] <Solow> It's just formatted differently
[03:14:26] <tocka> has anyone of you used blue imps query file upload? I can't restrict files being uploaded by type
[03:14:28] <tocka> :/
[03:14:36] <tocka> jQuery
[03:14:37] <tocka> *
[03:14:40] <PlasmaBunny> Solow: if i do echo microtime() in loop, i sometimes get the same timestamp
[03:14:42] <PlasmaBunny> that's unwanted.
[03:15:06] <Solow> PlasmaBunny: That's sometimes perhaps the case.
[03:15:31] <PlasmaBunny> Solow: i need a new timestamp every time
[03:15:37] <Solow> PlasmaBunny: I think it is.
[03:15:50] <Solow> PlasmaBunny: Perhaps your loops are just really fast.
[03:15:57] <Solow> try #php
[03:16:01] <PlasmaBunny> 0.07593700 1345630315
[03:16:03] <PlasmaBunny> 0.07593800 1345630315
[03:16:05] <PlasmaBunny> 0.07593900 1345630315
[03:16:07] <PlasmaBunny> 0.07593900 1345630315
[03:16:09] <PlasmaBunny> 0.07594000 1345630315
[03:16:11] <PlasmaBunny> see? 3 and 4 are equal
[03:16:36] <Solow> PlasmaBunny: Perhaps that's just the case.
[03:16:54] <PlasmaBunny> Solow: well i need something more accurate
[03:16:59] <PlasmaBunny> maybe nanotime() if it was there
[03:17:19] <Solow> $nanotime = system('date +%s%N');
[03:17:29] <Nece228> hello, can i put if condition inside jquery selector?
[03:17:35] <Solow> PlasmaBunny: are you running linux?
[03:17:54] <Solow> Nece228: Selectors supply their own conditionals.
[03:17:59] <xnotte> shouldn't this method run ? http://pastebin.com/5QhamF3U
[03:18:11] <Solow> xnotte: If it doesn't, then no.
[03:18:23] <PlasmaBunny> Solow: system() is not the option.
[03:18:34] <Solow> PlasmaBunny: Then no, not possible.
[03:19:02] <Nece228> Solow: in this case $('test' if (variable == true) {' is right'})
[03:19:12] <xnotte> Solow: can you see the problem ?
[03:19:46] <Solow> Nece228: A bit more specific. Normally you wrap conditionals around your selectors, so perhaps you could build your selector based on conditionals before passing it to jQuery.
[03:19:54] <Solow> xnotte: Not really. errors?
[03:20:54] <xnotte> Solow: nothing, just doesnt enter in that method in debug
[03:21:01] <Nece228> well ok

[03:33:45] <Palanivel> i dont know to to set time interval
[03:35:07] <se-lite> Not sure how much a jquery this question this is, but lets say you have some options on a webpage, and use jquery/xhr to save the settings the user choose there. What kind of tools does one have to make sure the actual last choise from the user is the one received by the server? (In case the first request get slowed down by package loss, then the user change his choice and is received by the server before the secound choise, which is the correct one.. Suggeseti
[03:35:46] <xec> Palanivel: what are you trying to make it do specifically?
[03:37:08] <Palanivel> @Xec.......in that example the button is animating countless time.....but i want to give time interval(settime)......
[03:37:33] <xec> Palanivel: longer fading? delays between? or a fixed number of fades?
[03:37:49] <Palanivel> @Xec.......for 1 min the animation will happen sfter that showi in static

[03:40:03] <bot-t> entrada, .animate() – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[03:40:14] <xec> Palanivel: so you want it to fade in and out for a minute and then stop?
[03:40:29] <Palanivel> @entrada.... ya exactly
[03:40:37] <Palanivel> @xec... ya exactly
[03:41:02] <entrada> Palanivel: Just use a .show(time)
[03:41:21] <sjeijk> hi guys is there a way to bind a function to a div, without a event? or is there a best way?
[03:41:34] <entrada> sjeijk: That makes no sense.
[03:41:36] <xec> Palanivel: just do a setTimeout that calls the .stop method
[03:41:49] <xec> ?xy @ sjeijk
[03:41:50] <bot-t> sjeijk, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[03:42:25] <entrada> xec: Is there a list of IRC bots/commands I can refer?
[03:43:05] <xec> entrada: there used to be a site, not sure if it's still up
[03:43:13] <Palanivel> @xec... am too searchin that only but i dont know how to use and where to use
[03:43:53] <sjeijk> ok .. well the point is I have this jquery wizard plugin running and then when I append some new elements, i need to run the initial wizard code againâ€¦ if you understand what i mean
[03:44:25] <entrada> Palanivel: This IRC is not to teach your jQuery. Read jqfundamentals.com to learn
[03:44:42] <sjeijk> i was thinking that it would be better to bind it somehow so it automatically assigns the wizard functionality to the new elements
[03:45:11] <xec> Palanivel: http://jsfiddle.net/cqEEL/29/
[03:45:20] <Palanivel> @entrada...ill study but i need now itself now to complete............
[03:45:22] <entrada> sjeijk: call your jquery wizard code when you append new elements
[03:46:38] <entrada> Palanivel: classic excuse.
[03:47:17] <Palanivel> @entrada...mmmmmmmm Thank u.....
[03:47:22] <sjeijk> well I'm doing that, but then somehow it's malfunctioningâ€¦ this wizard has in my case 3 steps, but after running it once, adding a new column, and run the wizard again, it skips the last stepâ€¦
[03:47:35] <Palanivel> @xec....thankzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[03:48:03] <entrada> sjeijk: It probably sees that the plugin has already been activated, hence doesn't do it again
[03:48:54] <sjeijk> should i destroy it somehow and then initialize again?
[03:49:20] <entrada> sjeijk: figure out what the plugin does
[03:49:26] <entrada> maybe it uses some data attribute
[03:49:41] <entrada> if your plugin has some sort of destroy method
[03:49:42] <entrada> use it
[03:50:04] <sjeijk> ok.. tx ill look into that
[04:12:50] <mazzachre> I can't see this in the documentation, will .innerHeight() return the height sans scrollbars?
[04:16:43] <mazzachre> Damned... it does not :( Any way I can get the visible height of an element that have scrollbars?
[04:23:30] <tocka> Im kind of stuck. Im logging in console an object console.log(data) and thats what I get http://postimage.org/image/ui4ivlqhl/ , how could I get size from all this?
[04:25:20] <Cork> mazzachre: the height of the element should be .height()
[04:25:22] <johnkpaul> tocka: obj.files[0].size
[04:25:48] <tocka> johnkpaul thanks! :)
[04:25:54] <johnkpaul> np, have fun
[04:27:56] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya, that is the height displayed... I want the height inside, the amount of space I can draw in... and it might have a scrollbar so the height is too much (by some 24px on my current configuration with firefox... something else in other browsers and other configaurations)
[04:31:06] <Cork> mazzachre: scrollHeight
[04:31:22] <Cork> mazzachre: though all elements doesn't give a correct value there
[04:31:36] <Cork> uh.. *not all elements give a correct value there
[04:33:12] <Cork> mazzachre: only other option is to wrap the content in an additional div and grab its height (i've used this hack my self several times)
[04:56:10] <nFFF> Guys I got an issue, in chrome/firefox all javascript works fine, however in IE 9 nothing: http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/stealth/
[04:56:23] <nFFF> I have custom select boxes and ajax add to cart that dont work in IE 9 specifically
[04:56:28] <mazzachre> Cork: Uhm... Not quite sure what to do here... I have a div that have overflow auto, inside is a potentially larger div (depending on the data I put into it) Outside is yet another div, that I want to be the same height as the scrollable area of the first div... So first div may be 500px height, inner is 3000px height, and then I want the other div to be 476px height (on my current setup, but 480px on other setup and 471px on a
[04:56:29] <mazzachre> third depending on how heigh the scrollbar is...
[04:56:35] <nFFF> really wierd, anyone have any insight?
[04:57:51] <Cork> mazzachre: so your looking for height - padding? or where does those 24px go?
[04:57:55] <Cork> mazzachre: the scrollbar?
[05:00:44] <mazzachre> Cork: Yes, the 24px on my system goes to the scrollbar.. but that is only on my system with this version of firefox etc etc...
[05:02:26] <Cork> mazzachre: have you tried innerHeight ?
[05:02:34] <Cork> that include the padding though
[05:05:48] <mazzachre> Cork: Yes, innerHeight returns the hight including the scrollbar (if there is one) so it does not differ between element sans scrollbar and element with scrollbar
[05:06:50] <Cork> hmm
[05:06:52] <Cork> one sec
[05:12:28] <mazzachre> Is there some way to make a jquery ui dialog widget scroll horizontally instead of vertically? I have added some links, which I am converting to buttons, but I want them on 1 line with a scrollbutton on the bottom instead of in rows with a scrollbar to the right...
[05:13:30] <Cork> mazzachre: html is built to primarly scroll vertically
[05:13:53] <geekie> Horizontal scrollbars are annoying on anything that doesn't have a touch/track pad.
[05:14:04] <Cork> mazzachre: anyway i've been looking through my notes, i know i once wrote code to detect the scrollbar width (i even use it somewhere) but can't find it right now :/
[05:15:23] <geekie> mazzachre: have you tried the css overflow attributes on it?
[05:15:37] <geekie> I havent tried but overflow-x: visible; or overflow: auto; might work.
[05:16:20] <Cork> overflow-x: visible won't make it not scroll it will actually let the text escape from the element
[05:16:46] <geekie> Ah sorry
[05:16:51] <geekie> meant overflow-x: scroll
[05:17:17] <Cork> if my memory isn't failing me to have horisontal scroll you need to force a child element to have that width
[05:17:55] <mazzachre> geekie: I have tried overflow yes... does not seem to have any effect at all..
[05:17:57] <Cork> cause a browser will try to make the text wrap before it try adding scrollbars
[05:18:05] <geekie> ah
[05:18:23] <Cork> so if text doesn't fitt it wrapps it; if it still doesn't fitt it adds scrollbars
[05:18:38] <Cork> THOUGH that said; you could try using white-space: nowrap;
[05:18:54] <Cork> but that only works for inline elements (not floats)
[05:19:07] <Cork> floats needs a container to help them
[05:20:07] <mazzachre> There are just jqueryui buttons... So I need to put them inside something else first?
[05:20:46] <Cork> mazzachre: the element doesn't matter; what css rules they have do
[05:21:23] <Cork> mazzachre: if there display value is inline or inline-block white-space works
[05:23:35] <mazzachre> Ah, that worked... thx!
[05:24:13] <mazzachre> Now I just have the problem with the scrollbar :(
[05:26:05] <Cork> mazzachre: are you ok with pregrabbing the size of scrollbars on the system?
[05:27:20] <mazzachre> Cork: I think I will let it rest currently... There are more important things to finish first... Then I might replace the scrollbars with one of the custom jquery plugin ones...
[05:30:24] <nFFF> Guys I got an issue, in chrome/firefox all javascript works fine, however in IE 9 nothing: http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/stealth/
[05:30:28] <nFFF> I have custom select boxes and ajax add to cart that dont work in IE 9 specifically
[05:30:29] <mazzachre> Another question with dialog.. why is the first element always focused? I don't want that for my buttons..
[05:30:31] <nFFF> any ideas?
[05:30:57] <mazzachre> nFFF: IE is always special...
[05:31:33] <nFFF> Ill tell 40% of the customers that
[05:31:40] <nFFF> and hope they stll buy?
[05:32:06] <jsmonkey> if I do document.getElementByType('frame') I will get all frames. But $('frame') does not work. any ideas?
[05:32:10] <mazzachre> nFFF: Try minimizing your code in something like jsfiddle, cutting everything off until you are sure where it goes wrong...
[05:32:50] <mazzachre> nFFF: It is always hard to debug a large piece of code...
[05:33:33] <mazzachre> nFFF: Are you by any chance outputting stuff to console?
[05:33:53] <matteu> jsmonkey: You want $('#frame') to reference an element with an id of 'frame'
[05:34:15] <jsmonkey> no I don't have access over the page so I can't name the id
[05:34:31] <matteu> jsmonkey: $('frame') is a selector for all frame-type elements
[05:34:38] <jsmonkey> matteu: I mean why wouldn't $('frame') work when $('p') does?
[05:34:47] <Cork> matteu: and thats what he's doing in both cases
[05:34:48] <jsmonkey> matteu: I try to find every frame
[05:35:04] <Cork> jsmonkey: on what document are you running this?
[05:35:11] <jsmonkey> $('frame') gives my nothing but document.getElementByType('frame') gives me all the frames
[05:35:17] <Cork> $ always refer to the pages document
[05:35:20] <jsmonkey> Cork: the top
[05:35:53] <Cork> jsmonkey: so you have jquery loaded in the outer document in your frame structure?
[05:36:10] <Cork> cause jquery bind the document when its loaded
[05:36:33] <Cork> if not then you need to try something like $(document.top).find('frame')
[05:36:47] <nFFF> mazzachre, Im not sure how to debug as it works in every other browser
[05:36:54] <nFFF> and all javascript is failing in IE 9
[05:37:03] <nFFF> works in all other versions of IE
[05:37:14] <nFFF> and to make thigns wierder, when loading page in dev mdoe in ie9, it works fine
[05:37:32] <jsmonkey> Cork: that might be the case. I just have an iframe on my domain and in it I open up websites that are not my domain nor created by me. one of these pages have frameset.... and in those cases I need to access the frame by name since I get in the wrong frame when I just load it straight up
[05:37:35] <Cork> nFFF: have you tried commenting out parts of the code until something woks?
[05:37:54] <jsmonkey> Cork: thanks for your tip. will try it right awway, thanks
[05:38:20] <Cork> ugg frames in an iframe
[05:38:43] <mazzachre> nFFF: Oh.. that is even more funny then... What I have found that might be related, if you output via console.log() then some versions of IE halts completely when not in debug mode, because console is not defined in normal mode, and access to .log will throw an exception.. It will work nicely in debug mode, so very difficult to debug
[05:38:54] <Cork> i'm SOOO happy i'm not in your shoes
[05:39:25] <Cork> mazzachre: ya, thats ie8 for you
[05:39:40] <Cork> mazzachre: ie < 8 crashes all togeather cause they don't have console at all
[05:39:46] <mazzachre> nFFF: Might be useful... Otherwise again, try from one end... Comment out everything, then try uncommenting from an end until it stops working again...
[05:39:54] <jsmonkey> Cork: haha
[05:40:16] <nFFF> mazzachre
[05:40:17] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya... That was quite funny... Found that at some point after hours of debugging, where it worked obviously... sigh...
[05:40:18] <nFFF> thanks
[05:40:21] <nFFF> solved it
[05:40:28] <nFFF> console.log was breaking it
[05:40:29] <mazzachre> nFFF: What was the problem?
[05:40:33] <mazzachre> Ah OK :)
[05:40:37] <Cork> classic
[05:40:40] <nFFF> thats some wierd shit right there
[05:40:56] <nFFF> dangerous bug :D
[05:41:18] <mazzachre> nFFF: Another nice thing is when working with setTimeout and setInterval... They are also not implemented the same way in IE and the rest of the world (even the api is different)
[05:41:19] <Cork> well leaving console.log around isn't good to begin with
[05:41:59] <mazzachre> Cork: You can set console.log to write random jokes to the user... Someone might notice and laugh :D
[05:42:27] <Cork> mazzachre: the complete dom and js implementation differed completely if you go back to ie 6 and back
[05:43:07] <Cork> mazzachre: well theres a speed cost in outputing things to the browsers console
[05:43:33] <Cork> mazzachre: and if you ever get to try zimbra you will have a good sense of what not to do :/
[05:43:49] <Cork> (it spams the console like mad, in production release!)
[05:44:01] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya... I still loved IE3 best (before security patch) where you could implement "format C: \q \y" as activeX element and it worked :)
[05:44:25] <Cork> mazzachre: well that was a feature
[05:44:32] <Cork> >_>
[05:46:00] <mazzachre> Cork: Well talk about perfomance.. have you ever tried writing something for IBM WebSphere? It have a defautl included script that traverses all elements and does stuff to some of them... It takes around 700ms in the beginning of each view
[05:46:41] <Cork> mazzachre: lovely..., no never
[05:48:07] <PlasmaBunny> what is the best language for developing ai?
[05:48:10] <mazzachre> Cork: Which makes anything I do, seem very fast by comparison..
[05:52:34] <matteu> PlasmaBunny: this isn't really relevant to the room topic.  I recommend researching Lisp and functional programming, or Python
[06:00:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> jDoes anyone know of a jquery plugin that allows you to dynamically load content with php when scrolling down ?
[06:00:45] <moijk> that isn't that hard
[06:00:53] <PlasmaBunny> matteu: why lisp or python?
[06:00:56] <PlasmaBunny> why not jquery?
[06:01:27] <matteu> PlasmaBunny: you can do whatever you want, but lisp and python typically have the language structures/libraries to be able to handle AI type problems.
[06:02:46] <Munchor> Hey guys
[06:02:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> moijk: that doesn't help much ;)
[06:03:02] <Munchor> https://gist.github.com/5036c3dd9b4d77ec5e18 I have this little code to look for something and highlight it
[06:03:09] <Munchor> But it's case-sensitive
[06:03:14] <Munchor> How can I make it non-case-sensitive? Thanks.
[06:03:57] <PlasmaBunny> matteu: what are 'AI type problems'?
[06:05:50] <matteu> PlasmaBunny: that question is beyond the scope of the room.  Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#Artificial_intelligence
[06:05:55] <moijk> ecky--ptang-zoob: i should have given you my solution but my dev server is down and about 2000 km away from me (I'm on a business trip)
[06:06:07] <PlasmaBunny> matteu: well, you mentioned them as a reason to choose lisp or python
[06:06:20] <PlasmaBunny> i have no idea what did you mean by 'AI type problems'
[06:06:28] <moijk> ecky--ptang-zoob: point was i made one from scratch in about an hour, and i'm a newbee in jquery.
[06:06:32] <PlasmaBunny> and yes, i've already read wikipedia and other articles
[06:06:54] <matteu> PlasmaBunny: try #ai
[06:07:00] <moijk> (years of experience in javascript though)
[06:07:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> moijk: only thing I don't know is how to let jquery know that the end of the frame is reached
[06:07:53] <MisterSpeaker> Is there a way to retrieve the instance of jQuery itself from a jQuery-wrapped object?
[06:09:31] <johnkpaul> MisterSpeaker: what do you mean instance of jQUery itself?
[06:12:07] <MisterSpeaker> The instance of jQuery that created the object. It's not for a regular website, so don't cry out in terror, but... I have an object passed to a function in a different iframe. The iframe does not have jQuery loaded
[06:12:31] <MisterSpeaker> and I want to know if I can get a reference to the original jQuery library FROM the object
[06:13:28] <MisterSpeaker> I can't see it on it's property list though. There is the $("body").jquery property, but it's just a string... "1.7.1"
[06:13:49] <MisterSpeaker> I seemed to remember once-upon-a-time you could
[06:14:03] <johnkpaul> hmm, there is .selector, but that's not what you're looking for either
[06:14:04] <walidvb> hi guys! i'm trying to use nested cycles to create a grid of images in which you can navigate(up/down, left/right). I have the whole thing working, except that I can't get it to be fluid. Been on this for hours and hours now, no chance to get it right. I do have an example, so I'm pretty sure it is doable!
[06:14:10] <walidvb> basically, the following:
[06:14:20] <walidvb> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/fluid.html
[06:14:26] <johnkpaul> MisterSpeaker: constructor
[06:14:33] <johnkpaul> ?eval $().constructor
[06:14:36] <bot-t> johnkpaul: <function Object() {[native code]}>
[06:14:39] <johnkpaul> ?eval $().constructor == $
[06:14:40] <bot-t> johnkpaul: false
[06:15:04] <MisterSpeaker> BINGO! thanks johnkpaul!
[06:15:11] <johnkpaul> no problem
[06:15:15] <johnkpaul> don't know why it's not working with the bot
[06:15:19] <johnkpaul> works in my local env
[06:15:46] <MisterSpeaker> yep, that's the one. Thanks again!
[06:15:49] <CatalinH> ecky--ptang-zoob : have you found that plugin for dinamic loading?
[06:15:52] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun MisterSpeaker
[06:16:15] <johnkpaul> ?eval $('div').constructor === $
[06:16:16] <bot-t> johnkpaul: false
[06:16:38] <walidvb> my online example is there: http://vbbros.net/dietz/works/project
[06:16:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no CatalinH
[06:16:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> found some nice scrollers, but nothing with dynamic content loading
[06:17:10] <walidvb> basically i want slideshows on each $('.project-wrapper'), and on $('.superframe .view-content')
[06:17:23] <sicp> this isn't having any effect on my own app, why is that? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8602722/phonegap-android-back-button-close-app-with-back-button-on-homepage
[06:17:37] <sicp> I press the back button and nothing of the code inside happens, it just goes back in the stack normally
[06:22:24] <sicp> any idea?
[06:24:19] <matteu> sicp: have you tried passing your jquery constructs to console to see how they are initializing and where control flow is going?
[06:24:39] <sicp> I have not; one moment to see what's going on
[06:25:32] <NaN> what am I doing wrong if I want to get the selectedIndex with .next('select')? > http://jsfiddle.net/GybRF/2/
[06:25:54] <ajpiano> ?next2 @ NaN
[06:25:55] <bot-t> NaN, .next("selector") is not "magically find the next element anywhere in the DOM that matches the selector". .next() looks at an element's next immediate sibling and then filters it by the selector. You might want to try .nextAll("selector").first(). (Note: .prev and .prevAll work the same way)
[06:26:23] <ajpiano> NaN: oh, the problem is that selectedIndex isn't a property of a jQuery object
[06:26:33] <ajpiano> select[0].selectedIndex
[06:26:43] <NaN> ajpiano: the thing is that next is giving me the selector that I need, but not the selectedIndex
[06:26:47] <ajpiano> ^^
[06:27:02] <NaN> ajpiano: I see..!
[06:27:09] <NaN> ajpiano: thanks man!! :D
[06:27:15] <sicp> the back button on my S3 triggered a "KeyDown" on the console
[06:27:28] <sicp> I had set the listener to "backbutton"
[06:27:37] <SoulRaven> is posibile to put jquery inside a web worker?
[06:27:56] <sicp> everything is possible
[06:27:57] <matteu> sicp: it would probably be helpful to disable the back button entirely while you debug, if you haven't already done so.  Try to use the SO code snippet to put a simple preventDefault call for every back button press.  After that, it should be easy to figure out the rest
[06:28:09] <SoulRaven> i know that jquery runs inside window, but  is an solution for that?
[06:28:17] <NaN> SoulRaven: what is a web worker?
[06:28:19] <matteu> sicp: if you can't simply stop the back button, then your addEventListener isn't working
[06:28:21] <sicp> ahhh yes preventDefault, I saw that in the SO code
[06:28:36] <sicp> I didn't use it because I wanted to have something simpler but yes, that's the one I need
[06:28:50] <sicp> because whatever I place there, it will probably be overriden by the button's default behavior
[06:29:05] <matteu> sicp: correct
[06:29:54] <code_ph0y> hey guys! ... is there a way to get every form element?
[06:30:07] <code_ph0y> without using id or classes?
[06:30:36] <NaN> code_ph0y: css selector?
[06:31:04] <code_ph0y> like input or textarea then?
[06:31:04] <matteu> code_ph0y: jQuery('input, select, textarea, <another form element>, ...')
[06:31:14] <code_ph0y> nice guys thanks!
[06:31:35] <SoulRaven> NaN: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/workers/basics/
[06:31:49] <NaN> SoulRaven: thanks man :)
[06:31:50] <walidvb> I'm going mad using cycle plugin to create a responsive size slideshow
[06:32:33] <rmill> walidvb, responsive?
[06:32:45] <walidvb> it works well on the example page, but doing the exact same(i think) doesn't do the trick
[06:32:53] <walidvb> rmill: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/fluid.html
[06:33:44] <sicp> still not taking effect..even with the preventDefault()
[06:33:59] <walidvb> rmill: can you be of any help?
[06:34:04] <walidvb> here is a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/VtWzh/
[06:34:14] <rmill> walidvb: you could give this a whirl: https://github.com/Wilto/Dynamic-Carousel
[06:35:38] <walidvb> rmill: argh i coded the whole thing with cycle already. and it is working on his site
[06:35:43] <walidvb> but i'll give it a look
[06:36:30] <rmill> walidvb: what's the issue? All malsup did in that example was specify a width in %
[06:36:46] <walidvb> rmill: well, i do a nested slideshow
[06:37:10] <walidvb> if you check the fiddle, you'll see it's working(even though the slide is too heigh)
[06:37:31] <walidvb> but uncomment the second slideshow, and the slides disappear
[06:37:53] <whatadewitt> can anyone help me with the .on() function? I used to use .live() for dynamically created items to attache event listeners, but trying to do this with .on does not work...
[06:38:16] <pachet> whatadewitt : basically, the idea is that you bind an event handler to a parent element
[06:38:25] <pachet> then delegate logic to children
[06:38:42] <pachet> so something like $('#bar').on('click.mynamespace', '.foo', some_callback)
[06:38:59] <pachet> will delegate that action to elements within #bar that match the class selector .foo
[06:39:12] <amitprakash> Hi.. in a $(form).submit(function(event) {/stmt/}) .. how can I detect how the form was submitted.. i.e. via enter or one of its buttons [ also which button ]
[06:39:13] <whatadewitt> so could i say $('body').on('click', '.answer', callback)?
[06:39:28] <sjeijk> hi all is there a jquery debugger which shows every step of your code?
[06:39:35] <whatadewitt> is body too high level? will i see a big drop in performance if i do that?
[06:39:40] <sicp> I don't think that the "backbutton" in the SO code refers to the hardware back button on my phone..
[06:39:52] <whatadewitt> sjeijk, just put "debugger" in your code and use firebug to step through, that's what i do
[06:39:54] <sicp> I am not getting any response whatsoever, it's never being pushed
[06:40:04] <pachet> whatadewitt: you could, yeah. probably not a huge performance hit until you have lots of elements
[06:40:13] <sjeijk> ok tx
[06:40:14] <walidvb> rmill: any clue?
[06:40:16] <pachet> whatadewitt: but specificity is always a virtue when we're talking about delegation
[06:40:42] <whatadewitt> pachet - it's just that pretty much everything on the page is going to be created dynamically, so i may have little choice
[06:40:51] <whatadewitt> but i appreaciate the help!!
[06:40:57] <whatadewitt> i'll give it a go and see what happens
[06:41:02] <pachet> whatadewitt: no sweat, sounds good
[06:41:29] <sjeijk> whatadewitt in doc ready or somewhere else
[06:41:55] <matteu> sicp: that very well may be
[06:42:21] <matteu> sicp: but now you know that you shouldn't mess with that addEventListener( "backbutton" .. any more
[06:42:32] <sicp> yea I'll look elsewhere
[06:42:32] <whatadewitt> sjeijk, wherever you wanna start debugging
[06:44:47] <rmill> walidvb: not really, no
[06:46:50] <MaxymiserTE> Hi. What is the best way to track whether someone leaves a page (i.e. "abandons the shopping cart") in jquery? I did a check on body unload but it is firing on all pages
[06:47:19] <walidvb> rmill: am i doing smth obviously wrong? my site is at http://vbbros.net/dietz/works/project
[06:47:25] <MaxymiserTE> i also checked for document.referrer if it is my cart page
[06:47:53] <MaxymiserTE> client's being finicky
[06:48:25] <rmill> walidvb: seems really glitchy
[06:48:38] <matteu> MaxymiserTE: probably cookies
[06:48:55] <ravenzz> MaxymiserTE add the script only to the page you need it
[06:49:29] <MaxymiserTE> I have the script there already, is the logic bad?
[06:49:37] <ak> is sad
[06:50:02] <celloflax> Hi.. I'm looking for something allow me to link a map with my chart.. When you go on a chart, on the map you should have a relative point. Do you know something like that???
[06:50:02] <NoiseEee> MaxymiserTE: analysis on abandoned shopping carts / clearing out carts should be left to the backend
[06:50:07] <MaxymiserTE> So I should place a script checking for a cookie on the cart page?
[06:50:19] <ak> is there some way to get the css of some :after element with jquery?
[06:50:20] <MaxymiserTE> its just a 3rd party tracker
[06:50:22] <NoiseEee> MaxymiserTE: you should be logging/saving everything, and then having a CRON or whatever to do what needs to be done
[06:50:36] <MaxymiserTE> I wish they gave us access to the API
[06:50:42] <ravenzz> how come that the other pages handle the unbind if the script is not there?
[06:51:22] <matteu> celloflax: I'm not sure what you mean by 'map'.  Traditional maps can be handled by google maps API and related jquery plugins
[06:51:42] <MaxymiserTE> on my script, I am checking if the referrer is my cart page and the location.search is not the query string of my page
[06:51:53] <MaxymiserTE> then added a window bind beforenload
[06:51:55] <MaxymiserTE> unload
[06:52:05] <pachet> ?g read css rule with javascript site:stackoverflow.com @ ak
[06:52:05] <matteu> MaxymiserTE:  I agree with NoiseEee that you should handle such things on the back end, but if it has to be jquery, use cookies.  There are good jquery cookie plugins out there
[06:52:06] <bot-t> ak, How do you read CSS rule values with JavaScript? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/324486/how-do-you-read-css-rule-values-with-javascript
[06:52:35] <MaxymiserTE> i'm in a weird predicament
[06:52:50] <walidvb> rmill: going for non-responsive. spent over 10 hours on this.
[06:52:59] <MaxymiserTE> no access to the site directly. the client puts our API on their site and we "attach" our changes through javascript
[06:53:00] <walidvb> rmill: or actully gonna check ur link again, sry ;9
[06:53:20] <MaxymiserTE> weird I know, the client should jjust give us access if we are to work on it
[06:53:21] <chaitu> hi everyone, i am trying to write  a listener  inside qunit.js file and i need some help for the same
[06:53:25] <celloflax> matteu: i try to explain better.. I have a chart with gps altitude.. If you go on one point on the chart, you should see the position on google maps..
[06:53:41] <ak> pachet: i still don't know, how to get it for the :after element...
[06:54:02] <matteu> celloflax:  my answer is the same, look at the google maps API and manipulate it using jquery or whatever javascript you wish
[06:54:03] <ak> i know how to get it for some normal element
[06:54:16] <MaxymiserTE> Why is Javascript so hard coming from a PHP backend?
[06:54:20] <wingy> is there any sliders out there with multiple thumbs like http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/example/slider/slider.html for jQuery
[06:54:36] <matteu> celloflax: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/
[06:54:49] <pachet> MaxymiserTE: is it?
[06:55:09] <celloflax> matteu: Ok thank you
[06:55:15] <MaxymiserTE> i mean if i had access to the PHP backend, i could do the check in 5 seconds
[06:55:19] <code_ph0y> $('input,select,textarea').each(function() {console.log($(this).name);});  <<< hey guys I had a question about an hour back about getting all elements from a form is that code correct?
[06:55:21] <walidvb> rmill: got any complete documentation?
[06:56:03] <pachet> code_ph0y: $(this).attr('name')
[06:56:19] <matteu> code_ph0y: Unless you need to use 'each' for some specific reason, I would recommend using more specific jQuery functions
[06:56:20] <code_ph0y> ahhhh thanks pachet my bad!
[06:56:29] <matteu> code_ph0y: like pachet just demonstrated
[06:57:06] <code_ph0y> thanks matteu!
[06:57:23] <chaitu> hi everyone, i am trying to write  a listener  inside qunit.js file and i need some help for the same
[06:57:35] <chaitu> any help ?
[07:01:01] <code_ph0y> ok we are getting somewhere!
[07:01:15] <code_ph0y> but am getting every element
[07:01:24] <code_ph0y> on the page and not in the form
[07:01:42] <code_ph0y> so I have created this ... $(form_id + ' input,' + form_id + ' select,' + form_id + ' textarea').each(function() {
[07:01:51] <code_ph0y> but it isn't working?
[07:02:18] <matteu> code_ph0y: $( '#formid input, #formid select, #formid textarea')
[07:02:27] <pachet> code_ph0y: yeah, what matteu said
[07:02:29] <code_ph0y> ahh damn!
[07:02:32] <pachet> you probably just need the '#'
[07:02:33] <code_ph0y> thanks!
[07:02:54] <matteu> code_ph0y: please read the jQuery documentation on selectors http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[07:02:58] <code_ph0y> lol .. am so use to mootools
[07:03:13] <code_ph0y> thanks matteu will do!
[07:03:37] <pachet> you can also just do $('input,select,textarea', my_form)
[07:03:49] <pachet> where my_form is a reference to that form in the dom
[07:04:19] <code_ph0y> ooo I like that better!
[07:04:22] <code_ph0y> its cleaner!
[07:05:10] <pachet> it's (essentially) synonymous with ->  my_form.find('input,select,textarea')

[07:07:17] <xckpd7> can someone help? I'm making an ajax request for some jsonp, and jQuery is appending some callback argument at the end of the url... is there anyway to turn this off, or remove it when I need to use it?

[07:12:24] <chaitu> hi everyone, i am trying to write  a listener  inside qunit.js file and i need some help for the same
[07:12:46] <matteu> chaitu: I don't think anyone understands what you mean qunit.js or 'listener.'  If you're trying to write an event listener, look at jQuery's docs on events
[07:13:15] <matteu> chaitu: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[07:13:18] <chaitu> matteu: i am talking about Qunit
[07:13:26] <juha_> chaitu: this is #jquery
[07:13:49] <chaitu> QUnit, Javascript Testing Framework
[07:14:08] <chaitu> is there any channel for Qunit
[07:14:52] <ajpiano> matteu: juha_ QUnit is jQuery's unit testing solution, it is relevant to this channel :)
[07:15:22] <codepython777> Can anyone recommend me something like this, but better: http://jsfiddle.net/gatnc/4/ (Better styling). ?

[07:17:23] <chaitu> ajiano : any help ?
[07:17:23] <ajpiano> i do believe so
[07:17:34] <pace_t_zulu> Note: in Windows, you may need to run grunt as grunt.cmd. See the FAQ for more Windows-specific information.

[07:18:57] <MaxymiserTE> I created a script to check the "unload" for the cart page. it seems to be working, now can't seem to determine if it is the "checkout page" or another page. So its tracking as if it was abandoned which is incorrect
[07:26:26] <sjeijk> is there a way to assign a click function that's in a plugin to a button
[07:27:17] <sjeijk> or is there a kind jquery pro thats willing to help me for 5m
[07:27:54] <codepython777> anyone has any suggestions for good tag editors?
[07:47:12] <rmill> sjeijk: function click_me() { /* do stuffs */ }; $( '#item' ).click( click_me );
[07:48:24] <jcp_> anyone know a jquery plugin that does this cool scrolling effect (it scrolls to an element for only a second then continues and stops at another element) http://www.useketchup.com/ (click "there's more")
[07:49:27] <sjeijk> gonna try that rmill
[07:50:14] <rmill> sjeijk, if the function exist outside of the click() ie _NOT_ $( '#item' ).click( function() { } );
[07:50:27] <rmill> then you can access the same function from multiple click()'s
[07:52:52] <sjeijk> not sure how I should get it to work
[07:53:03] <rmill> sjeijk: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/NAFJN/
[07:53:08] <rmill> (as an example)
[07:55:31] <sicp> what's the function that I need to do something whenever a page of mine is..well, accessed
[07:55:37] <sicp> the .ready() runs only once
[07:56:07] <sicp> I want $("#my_page").onSomething(function () {});
[07:56:24] <rmill> sicp, um
[07:56:33] <rmill> ?on @ sicp
[07:56:34] <bot-t> sicp, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:57:26] <rmill> sicp, you'd have to provide more detail to get a better answer.
[07:57:39] <quicksilver> sicp: "accessed" ?
[07:57:50] <sicp> yea I'm not sure what's happening here, but my navbar is screwing up for no apparent reason, all of the HTML is fine and in line
[07:58:16] <sicp> I go to one of the tabs, kicks me off to another one, I go back to it, it's fine, etc..structured-erratic behavior
[07:58:19] <sicp> lol
[07:58:50] <sjeijk> rmill can't get it to work
[07:59:28] <sjeijk> I need to bind the function on line 150 from http://www.thebandwidthmatrix.com/assets/template/main/js/libs/jquery.form.wizard.js from outside that plugin to a new button
[07:59:42] <andrewjbaker> How can I achieve the following, using jQuery... http://pastie.org/private/uya6t1d0g852elhznprvla Where document.getElementById('content') is replaced with the element to which my jQuery UI widget was attached? $('content').plugin();
[08:00:11] <sjeijk> the function is called _next : function(){ â€¦ }
[08:00:44] <sjeijk> and its pretty much driving me nuts :s
[08:01:09] <andrewjbaker> So... this.element.clone(false, true); or something similar?
[08:01:53] <andrewjbaker> var content = this.element.clone(false, true); content.remove('img'); ?
[08:19:14] <gkatsev> any ideas why .addClass wont work in safari but will work in chrome?
[08:19:23] <sjeijk> rmill still here?
[08:21:51] <lduros> hi, I'd like to detect click that are on the $("body") element except for a particular div, so that I can hide that div if there is a click anywhere else. Any good way to do this?
[08:22:32] <pachet> hi gkatsev. not sure why that'd be, do you have a link?
[08:23:27] <gkatsev> pachet: not really, but for some reason in chrome it's adding my class but in safari it's adding 'undefined' instead.
[08:23:35] <gkatsev> let me see if I _can_ get a test-case
[08:23:52] <pachet> lduros: i'd recommend just having a separate click handler on that specific div, that cancels the event bubbling
[08:24:03] <pachet> lduros: then you can bind whatever other logic you want to 'body'
[08:24:26] <lduros> pachet: problem is that when I have stopPropagation on that div, then I can't use it for inputs and focus
[08:24:31] <lduros> it seems the focus doesn't happen
[08:27:23] <pachet> lduros: $('body').on('click.mynamespace, function ( event ) { if ( $(event.target).is('#foo') ) { return; } /* do stuff */ });
[08:28:25] <pachet> s/mynamespace/mynamespace'
[08:29:45] <NoiseEee> lduros: div's don't have a focus event
[08:30:39] <gkatsev> pachet: could it be because it isn't an HTML DOM document but just some parsed XML?
[08:32:16] <rmill> sjeijk: unfortunately, you will _not_ be able to point to function from another location.
[08:32:39] <rmill> because it's enclosed inside that widget.
[08:33:06] <sjeijk> ok
[08:33:30] <sjeijk> now i feel really sad ;)
[08:36:07] <EnginA> ajpiano: btw, I also checked the router part of backbone
[08:36:29] <EnginA> it's quite similar to what I got right now... though I don't get why it pays special attention to history
[08:36:38] <pachet> gkatsev: uhm, could be. but having it set 'undefined' doesn't strike me as the most likely xml error to run into
[08:36:47] <pachet> gkatsev: what are you passing to addClass()?
[08:36:57] <EnginA> if you are using hashtag based navigation (routing, i.e. method dispatching) browser already keeps history for you, so with back/forward your methods will be invoked again anyway
[08:36:59] <gkatsev> pachet: a string. a valid string.
[08:37:10] <EnginA> why does it need it history ? do you have any idea ?
[08:37:25] <EnginA> I mean, why does it have a special history management ?
[08:37:49] <gkatsev> pachet: technically, it isn't even being set as undefined. It actually doesn't seem to be doing anything at all. Just later when I copy the element over to the HTML DOM in safari I get undefined instead of the correct class
[08:39:46] <ajpiano> EnginA: how would it invoke those methods on navigation, if there wasn't a router
[08:39:47] <ajpiano> lol
[08:40:03] <xmattdh> I'm heading back into LYAH territory I don't understand.
[08:40:23] <xmattdh> Sorry, wrong channel ^^
[08:42:35] <sjeijk> rmill is there a way to bind a function to an element that is not even created yet
[08:42:39] <sjeijk> like .on
[08:42:50] <sjeijk> from out the plugin?
[08:43:04] <gkatsev> pachet: hm... yeah, there's definitely something weird going on because when I used the DOM function .setAttribute the class was added correctly. I actually just switched to jquery .addClass so I wont have to do null checking and the like...
[08:50:52] <pachet> gkatsev: try .attr('class', 'some_class') maybe
[08:52:00] <gkatsev> that works...
[08:52:33] <gkatsev> though, in that case, i'll still need to do the null checking which is what I wanted to avoid :/
[08:52:41] <pachet> yeah :[
[08:52:56] <gkatsev> ugh
[08:52:57] <gkatsev> wtf
[08:53:21] <gkatsev> safari's dev tools aren't that great either :/
[08:54:54] <ajpiano> lduros: var foo = $("#targetArea")[0];  $.contains( foo, event.target ); inside of an event handler
[08:55:20] <ajpiano> will return a boolean of whether the event target is inside a particular element
[08:55:28] <ajpiano> ?jQuery.contains @ lduros
[08:55:29] <bot-t> lduros, jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[09:01:39] <gkatsev> pachet: oh, I see why it doesn't work. well, I dont know why but it is the reason. jquery's addClass uses element.className but safari doesn't let the className change (possibly because it isn't an HTML DOM element) where as .attr() uses setAttribute
[09:02:16] <gkatsev> I guess I can "steal" jquery's addClass and change the .className to .setAttribute
[09:03:53] <pachet> ah gotcha
[09:10:16] <EnginA> ajpiano: I'm talkinga bout the history.start thing
[09:10:34] <EnginA> ajpiano: in my implementation there's only a hash change event, and upon that there's the method invoker
[09:10:51] <EnginA> mine is like this /#method?foo=bar&john=doe
[09:11:20] <EnginA> and "function method(param){ console.log(param.foo); };"
[09:11:22] <EnginA> is executed
[09:11:23] <ajpiano> EnginA: backbone doesn't just support hash history, it also does pushstate
[09:11:38] <ajpiano> if you read the source of history.start
[09:11:46] <ajpiano> then you'll see why it does it that way
[09:11:47] <EnginA> I read that pushstate thing in the docs of it
[09:11:51] <EnginA> don't know what it really is though
[09:11:54] <ajpiano> and if you have more questions ask in #documentcloud
[09:12:05] <EnginA> but I fail to imagine what is not enough of the browsers history
[09:12:30] <EnginA> I'm not curious about backbone's usage, just about the design
[09:12:51] <ajpiano> that is still a question for #documentcloud, ostensibly
[09:13:08] <ajpiano> what does that even mean, "what is not enough of the browsers history"
[09:13:12] <geekbuntu> ajpiano, did i read correctly, you're looking to capture history?
[09:13:19] <ajpiano> what, no
[09:13:35] <ajpiano> EnginA is asking me why Backbone's router works the way that it does
[09:13:36] * geekbuntu ...puts time machine back in case
[09:13:42] <ajpiano> lolol
[09:13:43] <pachet> this is history in the making
[09:14:01] <geekbuntu> ajpiano, just used a local storage tool recently to start capturing page events
[09:14:07] <geekbuntu> could easily be used for history
[09:14:20] <ajpiano> ok

[09:30:23] <myevent> supposing i have 3 divs.Div1,div2,div3.Once any div is clicked,i add the class selected to that div.In my example,once another div is clicked,i remove all the class selected from all my divs,even those that do not have selected and add selected to the clicked div.Is there an easier way to go about it?.
[09:31:37] <NexHD> do you understand :D what i trying to say?
[09:31:39] <codecowboy> http://pastie.org/4569045 gives me Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function line 520 in chrome. Anyone know what might be causing this?
[09:31:54] <ravenzz> NexHD yes, check this out http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[09:32:28] <adiii> NexHD, create a focus-out event listener on the elements and write your logic there in that..
[09:33:41] <NexHD> the problem is i dont know how to combine two events in same function and if first event is in action , the two event to not get in action?
[09:34:17] <peterschmidler> Somehow my image rotation function rotating divs called .image also catches the div called .image-overlay. How can this be prevented? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/LieBs
[09:34:38] <ravenzz> codecowboy (function ($) { })(jQuery); this is the way how you are supposed to do that
[09:34:55] <ravenzz> $(document).ready(function($) { })(jQuery);
[09:34:59] <ravenzz> is wrong
[09:35:07] <codecowboy> ravenzz, thanks. its a third-party plugin
[09:35:50] <adiii> NexHD, why you need to combine two events,Just use $('.input') for selecting all the elements in the form.And attach event to them.
[09:36:39] <NexHD> and wich event i need to use?
[09:36:53] <ravenzz> blur or focusout
[09:37:08] <NexHD> ok
[09:37:14] <NexHD> i have one more question
[09:37:23] <ravenzz> $('form').on('blur', 'input', function () { })
[09:37:31] <ravenzz> like that ^
[09:37:52] <ansolas> I love jqueries on() <3
[09:37:58] <NexHD> with the validation plugin that is in the jquery site how i wil add a page without reloading the page?
[09:38:13] <adiii> NexHD, focusout would be a good choice
[09:38:26] <ravenzz> NexHD what do you mena?
[09:38:30] <ravenzz> mean*
[09:39:11] <deed02392> hey guys, can anyone take a look at this little function and give me some clue as to why I'm getting a 'is not a function' for an element obtained using jQuery selector? http://jsfiddle.net/xARkf/
[09:39:16] <ravenzz> with that plugin you validate the form, that's all you can do with it
[09:39:25] <deed02392> on the line $(item).on
[09:39:28] <NexHD> yes
[09:39:35] <deed02392> when I get 'item' defined from the each method
[09:40:02] <adiii> ravenzz, Do you know a jquery scroll plugin which works well in all browsers and is easy to theme..Any experience with any.
[09:40:21] <ravenzz> uhm never used one
[09:40:24] <ravenzz> sorry
[09:40:37] <NexHD> but i ask how i add a page without reloading the page? to hide the form and show a mesage for succes
[09:40:37] <NexHD> ?
[09:40:52] <ravenzz> ?jqf @ NexHD
[09:40:52] <bot-t> NexHD, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[09:41:19] <ravenzz> you should learn some bases
[09:41:30] <adiii> ravenzz, np thanks..  I think i will have to try some of them.
[09:42:30] <ravenzz> actually I remember of one but I don't remember its name -.-
[09:42:36] <deed02392> it's only 10 lines, somebody?
[09:43:20] <ravenzz> deed02392 no:D
[09:43:30] <deed02392> lol :(
[09:43:31] <adiii> :D
[09:43:41] <ravenzz> deed02392 your script if fine period
[09:43:46] <deed02392> I know I must have the element because I can access item.value etc
[09:43:54] <ravenzz> it is not about that
[09:43:58] <deed02392> really??
[09:43:59] <ravenzz> lol
[09:44:00] <deed02392> I get an error in Firebug saying $(item).on is not a function
[09:44:05] <ravenzz> yes dude
[09:44:23] <ravenzz> you'd select jQuery from the jsfiddle Framework Panel
[09:44:26] <peterschmidler> Can it be that .image-overlay is catched by $('.image:first')?
[09:44:30] <ravenzz> that's why
[09:45:04] <deed02392> No but I mean in my website, i'm using jquery-1.4.4 and it's still saying that
[09:45:58] <NoiseEee> deed02392: on is >= 1.7 iirc
[09:46:01] <ravenzz> yes
[09:46:07] <deed02392> ah bugger it
[09:46:15] <lduros> ajpiano: thanks!
[09:46:38] <deed02392> is anything likely to break if I replace 1.4.4 with 1.7?
[09:46:42] <deed02392> nothing's been deprecated has it?
[09:47:13] <peterschmidler> Why is my image rotation function also catching the overlay...? http://codepen.io/peterschmidler/pen/LieBs
[09:47:35] <bindi> gonna crosspost, like it or not!
[09:47:40] <bindi> right, I have some fancy data that shows who invited who(whom?) to a channel, and I wanted to make it into a fancy html5/jquery/whatever animation where new users are attached to the mindmap as the time goes on
[09:47:55] <bindi> and it should have a slider for going back and forth in time.. what kind of tools am I looking at to make this happen?
[09:47:57] <ravenzz> deed02392 not sure, but it can be...take a look at the changelogs
[09:48:05] <deed02392> ok will do
[09:48:06] <deed02392> thanks
[09:49:07] <ravenzz> bindi ask on #web
[09:49:19] <shoky> peterschmidler: var next = active.next()
[09:49:57] <peterschmidler> shoky: What would I have to do in order to rotate only .image's?
[09:50:28] <ravenzz> next('.image')
[09:50:29] <shoky> peterschmidler: var next = active.next('.image')
[09:50:58] <peterschmidler> shoky: Thank you so much!
[09:52:26] <GuySoft> hey all, might anyone know to set a single value from here?: http://needim.github.com/noty/
[09:52:30] <GuySoft> i want to set the timeout to 5000
[09:57:14] <shoky> GuySoft: var noty = noty({ timeout: 5000 })    ?
[10:06:34] <sp00fz> Lets say, that ive got two sites, index and logout. How can i tell jquery to show a custom div (which says "now you are logged out" for an example) at the index site, when i run the logout.php script
[10:19:53] <ermadd> marco
[10:20:45] <deed02392> polo
[10:21:26] <ermadd> Can I ask a horribly basic jquery question here?
[10:21:36] <deed02392> if I use jQuery.getJSON, how do I then check if I didn't get an empty reply? I've tried 'data.length' or 'if(data)' but when I do get a response 'if(data)' isn't triggered
[10:22:29] <shoky> ermadd you can
[10:22:39] <shoky> and then we can all laugh at you
[10:22:49] <shoky> but also maybe help you
[10:23:41] <shoky> deed02392: an empty reply would mean invalid JSON, meaning there's an error
[10:24:05] <deed02392> oh right OK.
[10:24:29] <shoky> (which is why your success handler isn't called, i'm guessing)
[10:24:55] <deed02392> well when 'data' is an object, 'if(data)' doesn't trigger
[10:24:59] <deed02392> surely that's not right?
[10:25:23] <shoky> i don't know what you're doing exactly and what your server is responding exactly..
[10:25:50] <deed02392> ok the response is exactly this: {"upc":"123456","description":"sadf asf asd s","spec":"asdf asdf asdf"}
[10:25:58] <deed02392> using getJSON
[10:25:59] <ermadd> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/default.html  Is the 4 different script src's necessary for the date picker?
[10:26:14] <shoky> deed02392: is the success handler called?
[10:26:14] <deed02392> so 'data' should be the object that string builds, right?
[10:26:25] <deed02392> no
[10:26:27] <deed02392> the else of if(data) is called though
[10:26:35] <shoky> so the success handler IS called?
[10:26:53] <shoky> the callback function, i mean..
[10:26:55] <deed02392> oh ok yeah
[10:27:02] <deed02392> yeah
[10:27:02] <shoky> ok
[10:27:10] <deed02392> so it's a matter of i'm not testing the object properly i guess?
[10:27:10] <shoky> and if you console.log(data) what do you get
[10:27:34] <helielson> join #html5
[10:27:38] <deed02392> Object { upc=
[10:27:38] <deed02392> "123456"

[10:43:20] <butch1281> anyone here?
[10:43:23] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[10:43:47] <butch1281> Any idea why this code block executes the alert(0); method?  http://jsfiddle.net/PuK9g/  I would expect it to just bind the property no?
[10:45:12] <ryanneufeld> sorry, none
[10:45:25] <ryanneufeld> oh
[10:45:25] <ryanneufeld> wait
[10:45:27] <ryanneufeld> yes I do
[10:45:35] <ryanneufeld> I have an idea
[10:46:20] <ryanneufeld> not sure why you're using the prop that way, but my guess, and it's only a guess, is that you're probably triggering the onchange handler by setting onclick
[10:46:30] <pachet> no
[10:46:33] <ryanneufeld> which if you want to bind to clicks using jquery is a very strange way of doing it
[10:46:37] <pachet> prop accepts a function as an argument
[10:46:49] <pachet> so it's calling that function trying to suss out what you're actually setting the property to
[10:47:07] <pachet> this is a bad bad way to do this
[10:47:29] <ryanneufeld> pachet: is right
[10:47:42] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/PuK9g/1/
[10:47:45] <ryanneufeld> check the console
[10:48:02] <ryanneufeld> .prop also returns a function
[10:48:15] <ryanneufeld> which would explain whey when using it as a setter it's getting called
[10:48:18] <ryanneufeld> ?cc
[10:48:18] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[10:48:42] <ryanneufeld> butch1281: see ?prop
[10:48:43] <bot-t> butch1281, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[10:49:00] <butch1281> pachet: yes, jquery you would normally use .bind, but I was looking for a way to set the <select onchange=""> property, so that you can do myObj.get(0).onchange()
[10:49:22] <butch1281> is there a way to set the actual property in jquery?
[10:49:42] <pachet> what's wrong with just setting $('#foo').on('change', some_callback) ?
[10:50:01] <johnkpaul>  butch1281 if you _really_ need this behavior, why not span.click(function(){this.onchange()})
[10:50:09] <olleman> attr("onchange","xx") < but that's just stupid :(
[10:50:25] <johnkpaul> why do you need everything to go through the attributes?
[10:50:28] <butch1281> yea, unfortunately trying to maintain legacy compatability with old code
[10:50:34] <olleman> aaah
[10:50:46] <butch1281> i'd absolutely love to just bind
[10:50:57] <ryanneufeld> butch1281: why would you do that?
[10:51:01] <olleman> then $(select).attr() is the way to go
[10:51:02] <johnkpaul> but butch1281, .click() will work fine with legacy code
[10:51:03] <olleman> if it's really that bad
[10:51:21] <johnkpaul> does it explicitly check the handler is in an attribute?
[10:51:29] <butch1281> it doesn't set the actual attribute, so i cant go back to the element and say, document.getElementById("the_element").onchange()
[10:51:51] <butch1281> or can i? hmm... worth a fiddle
[10:52:00] <johnkpaul> butch1281: let me get a beter idea of what you're tyring to do, you want whatever happens when change fires, to happen on click as well?
[10:52:02] <johnkpaul> is that correct?
[10:53:13] <lduros> does blur always get triggered _after_ change on all browsers? For instance if you change an input or textarea value, then click somewhere else or hit tab, first you see change is triggered on FF, then blur is triggered, just want to make sure it's true on all browsers :-)
[10:53:16] <butch1281> johnkpaul, elementA has an event property, say onclick, onchange.  elementB needs to have those event properties copied over to them.  Once copied to elementB, you must be able to call those events using the legacy javascript onclick(), onchange() etc straight from document.getElementById dom object
[10:54:11] <pachet> that's awful
[10:54:21] <johnkpaul> oh, this is copying to a new element, I thought you just wanted the handlers on change to fire on click as well
[10:54:26] <pachet> why even bind them to those dom references at all
[10:54:35] <butch1281> legacy code
[10:54:36] <pachet> can't you just throw them into an object sorted by id
[10:54:43] <pachet> then do lookups :[
[10:55:01] <ryanneufeld> butch1281: use attr
[10:55:03] <butch1281> hackpatch for legacy code... i was just wondering if jquery had an easy way of doing this, it is possible... just takes more code
[10:55:07] <ryanneufeld> ?attr
[10:55:07] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[10:55:11] <ryanneufeld> it should work
[10:55:24] <butch1281> i was fiddling with attr, let me fiddle again =)
[10:56:49] <butch1281> nope, .attr still executes as well: http://jsfiddle.net/PuK9g/4/
[10:57:20] <pachet> butch1281: http://jsfiddle.net/mTKGJ/
[10:57:24] <pachet> i wrinse my hands of this
[10:57:49] <ryanneufeld> pachet: http://jsfiddle.net/PuK9g/5/
[10:57:58] <ryanneufeld> like that, you need to use attr in BOTH cases
[10:58:12] <EyePulp> rinse?
[10:58:23] <EyePulp> or wring
[10:58:30] <ryanneufeld> or wash
[10:58:32] <ryanneufeld> wat

[10:58:55] <pachet> wringse
[10:58:56] <codepython777> I've a set of strings from which I want to user to select a subset. How can I do this using jquery?

[11:15:30] <zezikaro> Hi, i'm just wondering how to get an array I have filtered with jquery's filter() back to an non-jquery object?
[11:15:39] <haizum_> i can't seem to get the <!--[if IE]> to work for me
[11:15:46] <Eviltwin> zezikaro: .get()
[11:15:47] <zezikaro> ie $.filter([1,2,3], function(key, value) { return value == 2; });
[11:15:52] <zezikaro> get didn't seem to work
[11:15:54] <haizum_> im putting html inside there and its not showing up
[11:16:06] <haizum_> just being commented out
[11:17:40] <_keith> when building a search via a ajax call in jQuery, what will perform better or what should be use, GET or POST method?
[11:17:47] <zezikaro> $.filter([1,2,3], function(key, value) { return value == 1; }) Eviltwin
[11:17:49] <zezikaro> is that fine? o.o
[11:17:50] <zezikaro> .length gives 0
[11:18:43] <Eviltwin> $.filter is not a user function
[11:19:01] <zezikaro> :'/
[11:19:10] <zezikaro> is there an alternative?
[11:19:25] <Eviltwin> Array.protoype.filter? :P

[11:26:44] <keyword> hi guys I trying to make basic auth request with ajax request http://pastie.org/private/exlx6lg4dcetqhsb38k0lq but not works anyone knows with?
[11:27:30] <dogarrhea2> how do you console log in ie
[11:27:44] <pachet> get ready for it...
[11:27:48] <pachet> console.log()
[11:31:14] <dogarrhea2> pachet... causes errors
[11:31:55] <keyword> anyone?
[11:32:02] <keyword> http://pastie.org/private/exlx6lg4dcetqhsb38k0lqÂ  this is my code
[11:32:25] <NoiseEee> keyword: what errors do you get?
[11:32:26] <dogarrhea2> how do you create a cross domain iframe test case in js fiddle?
[11:32:35] <dogarrhea2> with specific domains
[11:33:10] <keyword> NoiseEee: I'm using phonegap I cant see the error but return error connection
[11:33:22] <NoiseEee> keyword: well you're going to need errors to accurately debug.
[11:36:03] <wrapids> How do I determine the url for a script for an ajax call?
[11:36:45] <EnginA> looks like there's no way i can enforce event handler order
[11:37:02] <EnginA> i.e. i want to bind an event handler later and i want it to be triggered first
[11:37:38] <EnginA> in fact, isn't that supposed to be the default behaviour, that way we could add filters later... i.e. later event handler decides if the event should propagate or not
[11:38:14] <NexHD> i have a question
[11:38:18] <keyword> NoiseEee: can I run this code in jsfiddle?
[11:39:11] <NexHD> how i can do to work bind event when is pressed button submit
[11:39:12] <NexHD> ?
[11:39:26] <NoiseEee> keyword: 3<shrug> dunno how it deals with cross-domain issues, try it i guess, but surely you have your own way of debugging?
[11:40:05] <keyword> NoiseEee:  ok the code that I show you looks of?
[11:40:09] <keyword> * ok
[11:41:00] <NoiseEee> at a quick glance, sure.  http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ keyword
[11:41:34] <bfred> is there a way to have jQuery trigger a bubbled event on the parent instead of the child?
[11:42:13] <bfred> it should behave like $('parent').on('click','a', function); but in "function", "this should be the parent, not 'a'
[11:42:47] <NexHD> bfred how i can get to work bind event on submit button?
[11:43:07] <NoiseEee> bfred: uh, just $('parent').on('click',function(ev) { });
[11:43:15] <wrapids> Can I use relative path for the url of an ajax call?
[11:43:31] <NoiseEee> NexHD: hard to understand your question.
[11:44:11] <bfred> NexHD $('form').submit(function () {})
[11:48:02] <NexHD> bfred how can i get this http://jsfiddle.net/insetpixel/vL6x6/ to work on submit button?
[11:50:43] <EnginA> can we get response from handler after they are invoked with .trigger() ?
[11:50:59] <monk12> Is there a way to run a jquery script automatically on each page? like some FireBug Console plugin that runs on every page load?
[11:51:33] <monk12> I'd like to hide some debug GUI stuff someone else added to a web app hehe.
[11:51:45] <EnginA> imagine you have "changing" event, in that event, if you make event.cancel = true, the change would be cancelled and "changed" event would never be dired
[11:51:47] <EnginA> fred*
[11:51:47] <monk12> manually run on it on each page when i inspect it.
[11:51:49] <EnginA> fired*
[11:53:35] <monk12> or I'll make due with a way to keep the Firebug console on every tab of Firebug.
[11:53:49] <monk12> so don't need to keep switching back to Console tab to run things.
[11:54:03] <ColKurtz> monk12, yes check out greasemonkey
[11:54:25] <ColKurtz> it executes "user scripts"
[11:54:28] <monk12> oh yeh, greasemonkey :). forgot about that plugin. Thanks ColKurtz!
[11:54:33] <ColKurtz> np
[11:55:07] <EnginA> Looks like the best way is to pass a non-primative data type, so it is passed by reference and update it. i.e. var e = {cancel: false}; $(window).trigger('hashchanging', e); if(e.cancel) return; // execute the actual code.
[12:03:11] <jkay> I was using a monkey patch in 1.7.1 to use contains with case insensitivity. https://gist.github.com/3428398  I upgraded to 1.8.0 and it breaks.  I don't know if there's a better way to do what I'm trying to do.  Any help is appreciated.
[12:05:04] <ColKurtz> what's a 'monkey patch' jkay?
[12:05:27] <jkay> redefining the jQuery function
[12:05:44] <ColKurtz> yeah that's not a good way to go about it
[12:05:45] <ColKurtz> lol
[12:06:08] <ColKurtz> did you use like, prototype or something?
[12:06:18] <ColKurtz> to extend it?
[12:09:42] <civilordergone> hey, does anyone know how to get the full page width?
[12:10:12] <Kzim> hello, i have a little problem i have a function that update a texte field and then it call a json page and update the display. but sometimes the display is too fast and it show the old data. whatis the good way to be sure that even if the server is slow we always update the good result ? thx
[12:11:36] <jkay> ColKurtz: the code that works in 1.7.1 is in that gist
[12:11:48] <ColKurtz> what gist
[12:12:12] <someprimetime> civilordergone: $(document).width()?
[12:12:29] <someprimetime> or $('html, body').width()?
[12:12:33] <wrapids> Is there something wrong witht his that I'm missing? $.get('http://us.shipping.nmann.ifi-dev01/tmpl/cancel.php', function(order_number) { alert('things'); });
[12:12:40] <jaysern> hi guys, I might be a bit rusty on my OO, but I think I'm missing on something here with my ajax call: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1770868
[12:13:08] <ColKurtz> civilordergone, $(window).width()
[12:13:11] <civilordergone> someprimetime, thanks!  i was using documnet.body.offsetWidth
[12:13:15] <ColKurtz> but there are problems with the scroll bar
[12:13:17] <civilordergone> and was wondeirng why it was off
[12:13:21] <ColKurtz> and cross browser stuff
[12:13:44] <ColKurtz> I just forced the vertical scroll bar with html, body { overflow-y:scroll; }\
[12:13:48] <someprimetime> actually he's right window works better for IE
[12:14:08] <ColKurtz> I just dealt with this a bunch as I was making a full-window slideshow
[12:14:18] <jkay> ColKurtz:  https://gist.github.com/3428398
[12:14:25] <ColKurtz> it was maddenning trying to figure out a way to measure the screen width that would take the scroll bar into account
[12:14:26] <jkay> ColKurtz: in my orig post
[12:14:37] <multipass> hi, i have a checkbox inside of a div.. the div has a click event which triggers the checkbox click-- but if a user clicks a checkbox they cancel eachother out.. is there any way to stop one with jquery?
[12:15:35] <ColKurtz> multipass, instead of doing that, wrap the checkbox in a <label
[12:15:53] <multipass> i cant anymore
[12:16:06] <multipass> just looking for a jquery soluition
[12:16:09] <ColKurtz> <label for="myfield"><input type="checkbox" id="myfield" name="myfield" /> My Field</label>
[12:16:12] <ColKurtz> why can't you?
[12:16:58] <seich> multipass: have you tried stopping propagation?
[12:17:13] <seich> multipass: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[12:17:15] <multipass> well im doing check to see if its checked
[12:17:16] <ryanneufeld> multipass: return false; at The end of yoru click handler
[12:17:32] <multipass> but i think the checkbox click is triggered first
[12:25:49] <timing_> Guys!
[12:26:24] <timing_> with html5 audio and changing the volume, will the volume be saved for the domain? the browser? or not at all?
[12:26:34] <timing_> If no one knows I will test it myself :-)
[12:26:46] <Eviltwin> This is #jquery
[12:26:52] <Eviltwin> #javascript might know
[12:26:55] <Eviltwin> Otherwise test yourself :P
[12:28:33] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/9bsmt/10/ anyone know how i can prevent that green bordered box from going outside of the image on the left's container?
[12:29:09] <someprimetime> when the edge of the box gets to the edge of the image's container, i'd like to just prevent the box from going any further (e.g. moving outside of the image's box)
[12:29:13] <dialman> This is #jquery, not 'nam, there are rules here!
[12:29:18] <invisib> Hi guys, I'm trying to use jQueryUI datepicker on a text field in my form. It looks like I set it up right (as the calendar itself is displaying), but it's displaying before you click on the text input, and when you click on a date, the calendar doesn't disappear. Any ideas? http://mscns.webfactional.com/wattsbrothers/moving-quote/
[12:29:44] <timing> Eviltwin: I use a jquery html5 player plugin, but you have a fair point, forgot about #javascript :-)
[12:29:46] <invisib> It doesn't update my date selection after the first click either.
[12:30:08] <Eviltwin> Oh, jQuery is tangentially related, must be a #jquery problem. :P
[12:30:26] <invisib> (you can click -back- in the text field, then on the calendar to select a different date, but that's awfully unintuitive)
[12:33:36] <invisib> Maybe I don't have enough packages in my jQueryUI bundle? I just grabbed Core and Datepicker.
[12:33:45] <invisib> (and a theme obviously)
[12:34:29] <jaysern> I've narrowed down the problem to what looks like the ajax callback referencing a variable that's not passed by reference? http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1770892
[12:35:09] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[12:35:12] <Eviltwin> ?ajax101 @ jaysern

[12:38:15] <invisib> Anyone?
[12:39:19] <eph3meral> is there a simple way to use javascript to "jump to" an "internal link" as if I had done id="foo" and href="#foo"; ... but without having to modify window.location? or is it window.location.href, anyway, the address bar.
[12:40:44] <Eviltwin> eph3meral: $(window).scrollTop($("#foo").offset().top)
[12:41:02] <jaysern> Eviltwin: thanks - I guess I took for granted how quickly ajax calls usually return. But what is the solution then? write a function using setInterval that keeps checking until data is returned?
[12:41:25] <Eviltwin> No
[12:41:27] <Eviltwin> Use a callback function
[12:42:22] <eph3meral> Eviltwin: awesome thanks i'll try that
[12:42:34] <invisib> I'm trying to use jQueryUI datepicker on a text field in my form. It looks like I set it up right (as the calendar itself is displaying), but it's displaying before you click on the text input, and when you click on a date, the calendar doesn't disappear. Can anyone help?
[12:46:06] <mike33> http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/smoothscroll/ i have a fixed header, does anyone know if its possible to add an offset at the top using this script
[12:47:24] <invisib> Had to set id to datepicker. jqueryui can't pick it up by class
[12:47:55] <invisib> Possible to use multiple datepicker ui's then? There is functionality for it, but do you have to set multiple id's to the same thing?
[12:58:57] <m1chael> does anyone use bxslider? i'm trying to use a slideshow with captions and its only showing me 1 caption..

[13:01:32] <aniasis> when I do a do an alert($.mobile) I get undefined.
[13:01:34] <aniasis> why is that?
[13:02:25] <too_lazy_to_auth> so, i'm using drag and drop, I have a function that handles the drop event, it checks the meta tag for a type and places the corresponding element in the container but it places it in the top left corner, how do i make it stay where it's dropped?
[13:02:45] <aniasis> I have loaded the correct JS
[13:03:01] <too_lazy_to_auth> i have soemthing like this inside the function: if($(ui.draggable).data('type') == 'image') {$(this).append($("<img src='http://www.google.ca/images/icons/product/chrome-48.png'></img>").draggable());}

[13:19:34] <austinpray> If I am beating my head against a rock trying to make some jQuery work on an iPhone browser...where should I go to find someone who can help me?
[13:19:49] <Eviltwin> austinpray: LinkedIn
[13:19:55] <alaing> Thanks Eviltwin
[13:20:06] <austinpray> oh that's a really good idea
[13:21:53] <urdomainis4sale> I'm curious why that is a really goo idea
[13:21:56] <urdomainis4sale> good*
[13:24:09] <Eviltwin> Because jQuery experts are always available on LinkedIn and looking for more volunteer work because they're bored out of their minds
[13:24:14] <aniasis> Eviltwin, I keep getting undefined when I alert($.mobile);   why would that happen?
[13:24:53] <Eviltwin> Because it's not defined
[13:26:30] <austinpray> error: implied global "I'm not going to pay this person for their time"
[13:26:43] <austinpray> money -> problem solved
[13:27:40] <ryanneufeld> I feel like i walked in 1/2 way through a very sarcastic conversation between Eviltwin and austinpray
[13:27:58] <austinpray> no I was actually saying it was a good idea
[13:28:27] <austinpray> cause I can see if anyone is in my area and pay for a couple hours of their time
[13:29:53] <Eviltwin> Of course with what people write on their resumes these days
[13:30:17] <urdomainis4sale> just think it'd be better if he asked a more specific question pertaining to the error/problem that he is having in getting jquery to work on an iphone.. if he went the route of hiring someone, i'd think scriptlance or one of those sites would be better than linkedin - unless he wants to pay around $80/hr
[13:30:21] <Eviltwin> Someone who's looked at jQuery's website one time and never used it probably lists "jQuery expert"
[13:30:46] <urdomainis4sale> prob..
[13:30:58] <Eviltwin> urdomainis4sale: "Well this should only take 15 minutes so it'll only cost me $20, right?"
[13:31:30] <jedahan> is there a better way to turn a definition list into a javascript object than `object[$($('dt')[i]).text()] = $(v).text() for v,i in $('dd')`
[13:31:53] <urdomainis4sale> well when you put it that way
[13:31:56] <urdomainis4sale> heh
[13:32:42] <austinpray> I'll check out scriptlance
[13:32:44] <urdomainis4sale> 80/hr is cheap when you bill in 15 min increments
[13:32:56] <Vorspire> oDesk is a good alternative for freelance work too
[13:32:58] <austinpray> that's a great suggestion
[13:33:41] <alaing> Eviltwin: still not working for me. http://jsfiddle.net/2AhFq/1/
[13:34:00] <urdomainis4sale> austinpray: vworker is a better solution, imo
[13:34:18] <alaing> basically one its doen I want it to update after every second like a clock
[13:34:39] <someprimetime> i'm trying to make it so that the green box won't go outside of the image's boxâ€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/9bsmt/11/ if you move your mouse from the bottom of the image to the top of it and leave it'll stop
[13:34:44] <Eviltwin> alaing: http://jsfiddle.net/RVeax/
[13:35:16] <someprimetime> but it's returning from the mousemove bind it seems, so when you move your mouse on the image again, it stays in the location where it stopped
[13:35:58] <alaing> Eviltwin: I'm trying to integrate what you have kindly provided with my code
[13:36:12] <Trisox> how would you guys add a css property to an inline style? like i got style="color:red;" and i want to add background:yellow? so its to getter style="color:red; background:yellow;" ?
[13:36:14] <alaing> the weeks seem right
[13:36:27] <alaing> but the others seem to be jumping all around
[13:36:51] <alaing> Like it says there is 133 year between 10 oct 2012 and today this year
[13:36:56] <someprimetime> Trisox: $('#div').css('background-color', 'yellow').css('color', 'red');?
[13:37:20] <Trisox> no i dont know content of the style
[13:37:22] <Trisox> can be any thing
[13:37:30] <Trisox> just want to add the background yellow
[13:37:45] <someprimetime> i have no idea what you are asking
[13:38:09] <Trisox> i got style" some css here " and i want to add a new property to that
[13:38:23] <Eviltwin> alaing:
[13:38:28] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/2AhFq/3/
[13:38:58] <Trisox> never mind.. ...
[13:39:07] <Trisox> pff stuppid :D
[13:39:18] <someprimetime> ...
[13:39:19] <austinpray> opinions on JSLint?
[13:39:51] <Trisox> :D
[13:39:55] <Trisox> its late
[13:40:45] <pace_t_zulu> jslint is cool
[13:41:35] <tw2113> jslint has a place in my belly button
[13:42:20] <Vorspire> ...The sheer amount of differences in preference - you have to try it and see, or risk starting an argument about something trivial.
[13:43:33] <alaing> Thank you Eviltwin very much appreciated
[13:47:09] <ryanneufeld> urdomainis4sale: but when the min charge is 3 hours :p
[13:47:35] <ryanneufeld> my derp, scroll down before posting...
[13:48:30] <devslash> my site is at http://mms-test.no-ip.org/test/ if you go to any song and click on it a playlist appears on the left. i want to add a div to that item in that playlist. how do i do that ?  i Tried document.getElementById('jp_playlist_1 li'); but it returns null
[13:49:06] <someprimetime> i prefer jshint
[13:49:21] <austinpray> well I use JSLint
[13:49:24] <austinpray> and write all my code to comply with it
[13:49:58] <ryanneufeld> devslash: do you have a jquery question?
[13:50:06] <devslash> yea i just asked it
[13:50:23] <ryanneufeld> no, you asked a javascript question
[13:50:33] <devslash> no its a jquery question
[13:50:38] <devslash> my site is built using jquery
[13:50:42] <ryanneufeld> devslash: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.getElementById
[13:50:50] <devslash> that doesn't work
[13:50:53] <devslash> it returns null
[13:50:58] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/9bsmt/12/
[13:50:59] <ryanneufeld> right, cause you're doing it wrong
[13:51:14] <devslash> what am i doing wrong ?
[13:51:15] <derekpioneer> devslash: dude you gotta get the full counting crows discog
[13:51:17] <Eviltwin> devslash: document.getElementById is not jQuery
[13:51:18] <ryanneufeld> you're not using jquery, you're using native javascrupt
[13:51:18] <Eviltwin> Please see #javascript for such questions
[13:51:18] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: wow thanksâ€¦ yeah i guess it makes more sense to use mouseenter/mouseleave rather than hover
[13:51:21] <jaysern> Eviltwin: ok, so here's the problem. I am making an ajax call inside of .each(). the problem is, I need to collect the data from the ajax calls in the order I called them - which may arrive out of order because of the nature of async. surely someone's had to do this before?
[13:51:21] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[13:51:24] <Eviltwin> jaysern: Yes
[13:51:27] <Eviltwin> jaysern: Can you be a little more specific?
[13:51:45] <Eviltwin> jaysern: Like maybe show what the result of the AJAX calls looks like and what you want the collection to look like in the end?
[13:51:53] * abletony84 is now playing: Abletony84 - Sex Beat (http://home.no/dwaynie/sex_beat.mp3)
[13:52:12] <Eviltwin> abletony84: Please don't broadcast that stuff here
[13:52:18] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: why are you using Math.max() in this example?
[13:52:20] <pachet> devslash: an element with that id obviously doesn't exist when you call that method
[13:52:26] <Eviltwin> abletony84: We have enough noise as it is
[13:52:33] <pachet> devslash: are you waiting until the dom is parsed?
[13:52:37] <devslash> yes
[13:52:49] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Because if e.pageX - 82 becomes less than the left position of the image, I want to use the left position of the image instead
[13:53:17] <someprimetime> smart
[13:53:21] <someprimetime> +1
[13:53:50] <Eviltwin> That's why they pay me the big bucks
[13:55:17] <someprimetime> i want to be you
[13:57:45] <pachet> but he's evil though
[13:57:47] <pachet> he's the evil twin
[13:58:15] <someprimetime> fun fact: i was a twin in utero but that twin never ended up making it
[13:58:28] <Eviltwin> That's not a fun fact, that's a sad fact
[13:58:37] <pachet> so you're actually the evil twin
[13:58:46] <pachet> Eviltwin: can you trump that?
[13:58:47] <jaysern> Eviltwin: this obviously doesn't work as it is, but the pseudo code is what i'm trying to accomplish: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1771054
[13:58:48] <someprimetime> pachet: very well could be
[13:58:55] <Eviltwin> No, I'm actually the evil twin
[13:58:59] <Eviltwin> I actually have a twin
[13:59:16] <someprimetime> i wish i ended up having a twin that'd be awesome
[13:59:16] <pachet> a live twin
[13:59:19] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:00:10] <Eviltwin> jaysern: There are a couple ways to do this, I'm going to try to do it a simple way that's still clear
[14:00:31] <anli__> I have a background image, if the browser window is tall, I want the bg image to stretch on the height, if the browser window is wide, I want the bg to stretch on the width, the aspect ratio should be held, is this possible?
[14:01:31] <pachet> anli__: sure, just find the ratio of width / height
[14:01:41] <pachet> whichever side it falls on, that's the one to set by
[14:01:44] <anli__> I need to do it with script and a bg div, right?
[14:01:44] <NexHD> i have a question
[14:02:07] <pachet> anli__ just use an image tag :[
[14:02:13] <NexHD> how i need to do to work .blur event on submit button
[14:02:13] <NexHD> ?
[14:02:26] <anli__> pachet: And script?
[14:02:30] <ColKurtz> I don't believe the submit button has a blur event
[14:02:33] <ColKurtz> the form has a 'submit' event
[14:02:41] <ColKurtz> the submit button would have a 'click' event iirc
[14:02:47] <Eviltwin> jaysern: Try this: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1771058
[14:02:52] <ColKurtz> but I would probably prefer to use the 'submit' event for the form
[14:03:07] <NexHD> i dont understand
[14:03:29] <pachet> anli__: i just told you the logic, i'm not going to write it for you :[
[14:03:36] <pachet> if you get stuck, i'll take a look
[14:03:55] <anli__> I only wanted to know if using script is the solution
[14:04:35] <NexHD> how i combine .click and .blur events on the same function
[14:04:36] <NexHD> ?
[14:04:45] <Eviltwin> What does that mean?
[14:04:56] <ColKurtz> What are you trying to accomplish NexHD
[14:05:37] <NexHD> two events in the same function
[14:05:40] <NexHD> how i do that
[14:05:41] <NexHD> ?
[14:05:49] <pachet> blasphemy
[14:06:04] <Eviltwin> You only deal with one event at a time
[14:06:46] <ColKurtz> ^^
[14:07:00] <someprimetime> NexHD: http://jsfiddle.net/umDJe/ ?
[14:07:06] <someprimetime> not sure why you'd want that though
[14:07:12] <ColKurtz> you can create a function and bind the same function to two different events NexHD
[14:07:30] <ColKurtz> function myFunc(){ /* ... */ }
[14:07:39] <ColKurtz> $('form').on('submit', myFunc);
[14:07:57] <ColKurtz> $('input').on('blur', myFunc);
[14:09:11] <ColKurtz> hmm Eviltwin can you pass "this" as a parameter to the function so that you can access it without using an anonymous function?
[14:09:35] <Eviltwin> Which function?
[14:09:41] <Eviltwin> What's the context here?
[14:09:49] <ColKurtz> like in the example I just gave for NexHD
[14:10:03] <ColKurtz> function myFunc(myvar){  }
[14:10:16] <ColKurtz> er
[14:10:36] <ColKurtz> I suppose you can't even pass an argument to begin with since you reference it as on('submit', myFunc);
[14:10:55] <Eviltwin> Inside event listeners "this" will be the element it was bound to
[14:11:06] <Eviltwin> The first argument will be the event
[14:11:29] <Eviltwin> The event has an attribute .data which gets the "data" you can attach via .on
[14:11:31] <ColKurtz> so "this" still works fine even if it's not an anonymous function?
[14:11:47] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:11:50] <Eviltwin> Absolutely
[14:12:40] <Eviltwin> Named and anonymous functions are not treated any different at runtime
[14:12:54] <ericelliott> colKurtz: Actually, you can pass params. Just create an anonymous function on('submit' function () { myFunc(param); });
[14:16:20] <MaxymiserTE> I wrote a truncate function. I was wondering how i can strip out the html tags to get an accurate count of words. http://jsfiddle.net/GMk6m/
[14:16:48] <ColKurtz> ah there we go ericelliott
[14:16:51] <MaxymiserTE> So far it counts if there are html tags as part of the count. second argument is the number of words
[14:17:01] <ColKurtz> but then, does 'this' become out of scope inside myFunc?
[14:19:11] <jaysern> Eviltwin: interesting, i haven't had to use .when and deferreds before
[14:19:20] <jaysern> reading up on it now
[14:19:45] <Eviltwin> It's a little tricky when you have an array of deferreds
[14:19:48] <Eviltwin> You have to do that .apply thing
[14:19:52] <MaxymiserTE> I set up truncate to 29 words, it is counting 26 because of the 3 tags in my string
[14:20:09] <MaxymiserTE> it should also keep the html tags since it needs to output them
[14:34:54] <colun> Hello all, I search to make twitter bootstrap tab bookmarkable but this : $(function () { var activeTab = $('[href=' + location.hash + ']'); activeTab && activeTab.tab('show'); }); don't change the #tab1 in the adress bar. Have you any idea to make the change in the address bar when I clic on a tab ? Thanks
[14:38:12] <chovy> is it possible to scroll a textarea to the position of a word?
[14:44:59] <anli__> $('window').resize(function() {}); does not work at all for me
[14:46:57] <someprimetime> anli__: because it's (window) not ('window')
[14:47:13] <anli__> doooooh!
[14:47:26] <anli__> I have been sitting for a long time looking at that now
[14:47:32] <anli__> Incredible
[14:47:43] <anli__> thanks
[14:54:36] <jaysern> thanks Eviltwin
[14:54:47] <sunbeam> does anyone know how i can make sure there is 1px space between the thead th?
[14:56:00] <veleiro> add css margin?
[14:56:43] <sssilver> Hello gentlemen. http://coafkids.org/ -- on the search input animation upon focus, why does the button get cropped during animation? Thanks.
[15:01:13] <dialman> Nerdmaster!
[15:01:23] <Nerdmaster> Only in spirit, sir
[15:03:23] <sssilver> ..anyone?
[15:03:26] <sssilver> must be some trivial mistake
[15:09:40] <itimber> hey guys
[15:09:57] <itimber> is there a way to target a fancybox ready type event?
[15:10:10] <sssilver> OK looks like jQuery animate adds an overflow:hidden during animation to the div.... is there a way to ask it not to?
[15:10:26] <itimber> I'm trying to find out the auto-sized height of a div, and it keeps coming back as 0
[15:10:44] <itimber> I think my js is firing before the dom element is resized
[15:14:19] <ColKurtz> sssilver, are you calling animate or a shortcut like slideUp();
[15:14:28] <ColKurtz> animate should only animate the CSS properties you tell it to animate
[15:14:32] <ColKurtz> afaik
[15:14:49] <sssilver> ColKurtz: animate
[15:14:54] <sunbeam> i'd like to give each second thead th a class
[15:14:59] <sunbeam> each even i mean
[15:15:02] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this?
[15:15:23] <sssilver> What I did now is, I added an overflow: visible !important; to that div in my CSS, and now it works
[15:15:24] <sssilver> but it's a hack really
[15:15:27] <ColKurtz> itimber, is the div visible when you're trying to measure it?
[15:15:46] <ColKurtz> sssilver, at least it's not a nasty, ugly hack
[15:15:59] <sssilver> not very elegant
[15:16:21] <itimber> ColKurtz: I've tried to do an alert, and that always fires before the fancybox loadsâ€¦ so no
[15:17:11] <ColKurtz> yeah itimber, you can't measure the height of an element if it's set to display:none;
[15:17:27] <ColKurtz> what's the element? why do you need to measure its height?
[15:18:03] <itimber> ColKurtz: exactlyâ€¦ so I'm looking for a .ready() or something for the fancybox
[15:18:29] <ColKurtz> itimber, what are the callback functions listed in fancybox?
[15:18:36] <ColKurtz> there should be one for after the content has loaded.
[15:18:54] <itimber> yes
[15:19:04] <ColKurtz> that's where you would need to measure it then.
[15:19:23] <itimber> depending on the user's permissions, I'm adding an additional div in one particular fancybox
[15:19:39] <itimber> so, I'd rather not mess with the original fancybox call
[15:21:14] <itimber> ColKurtz: http://pastebin.com/v6Ety1i4
[15:21:21] <itimber> that is the Fancybox call
[15:23:48] <itimber> ColKurtz: here is the current version of my changes  http://pastebin.com/z1dCyHmi
[15:25:15] <itimber> and I'm wondering if the jQuery(document).ready(function() { should change to something like jQuery.fancybox.ready(function() {
[15:29:39] <itimber> I think I'll try to tackle it tomorrowâ€¦. thanks guys
[15:36:57] <NexHD> hi
[15:37:03] <NexHD> i have a question
[15:37:17] <sunbeam> i'd like to give each second thead th a class
[15:37:18] <sunbeam> each even i mean
[15:37:20] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this?
[15:37:58] <NexHD> how i do with if function if i want to excute that condition only onetime?
[15:39:02] <cifroes> I have a JS object with data and I want to submit a form with that data. I know I can use ajax .post and set data = myObj and jQuery submits an ajax Post with my data correct but I don't want to use an ajax Post, I just want to embed this data in a form and submit the form in a "old-fashioned" form-way.  Any tips to do this easily?
[15:40:09] <someprimetime> so you have a bunch of data in an object and you want to POST with a normal form POST?
[15:40:25] <someprimetime> but you somehow want to get the data out of that object and populate all appropriate form fields before you do so?
[15:41:29] <NexHD>  how i do with if function if i want to excute that condition only onetime?
[15:42:07] <cifroes> I don't have yet the form fields, and my object is an array with multiple attributes. I was wondering if there is a simple way to do this. I know I can do a lot of processing to achieve this but want a simpler way
[15:42:08] <someprimetime> NexHD: set a variable to false
[15:42:13] <someprimetime> once it goes to your if clause set it to true
[15:42:25] <cifroes> the same way there is a serialize but inverse :)
[15:42:26] <someprimetime> in your if clause check to see if it's true first
[15:44:03] <NexHD> i need to put return true on my if condition?
[16:08:03] <NexHD> hi
[16:08:10] <NexHD> how i do this?
[16:08:12] <NexHD> call variable and set true
[16:08:13] <NexHD> ?
[16:08:28] <Eviltwin> What's "this"?
[16:08:28] <kamo> Hello to my favorite rooom
[16:08:48] <NexHD> "call variable and set true"
[16:09:27] <NexHD> that
[16:09:28] <Eviltwin> ?cik
[16:09:28] <bot-t> Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[16:09:34] <Eviltwin> NexHD: Be more descriptive
[16:09:40] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/9bsmt/20/ how would I prevent the green box from going below the .js-orig-img and too far to the right of it as well?
[16:09:44] <Eviltwin> a(); b = true;
[16:09:45] <Eviltwin> Done
[16:09:47] <Eviltwin> Was that so hard?
[16:10:13] <NexHD> i need to set a variabile for an if statament
[16:10:27] <NexHD> for not repeating the condition
[16:11:40] <Eviltwin> Show example code of your current setup and explain what you're trying to change
[16:16:55] <Eviltwin> NexHD: Are you making an example?
[16:17:31] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/9bsmt/21/ right now i'm returning if the box goes past the width of the js-orig-img but i think I'll need to rebind the mousemoveâ€¦ right?
[16:17:54] <someprimetime> e.g. if you try to move the mouse from the left all the way to the right on the img
[16:23:33] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/9bsmt/22/
[16:29:13] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: thanks! :) now i just need to get a grip on Math.min/Math.max more and it looks like I can avoid those messy if statements I've been using
[16:29:59] <Eviltwin> If you want to force x to be >= a and <= b, Math.min(Math.max(a, x), b)
[16:30:11] <Eviltwin> Or Math.max(Math.min(b, x), a)
[16:31:11] <someprimetime> bad ass
[16:31:43] <someprimetime> also +1 on the event thingâ€¦ i've always been using that short circuit declaration for e in the past but it looks like i can just ignore it
[16:32:04] <Eviltwin> When using jQuery, yes
[16:33:35] <NexHD> someprimetime can i ask you something?
[16:33:43] <someprimetime> sure what's up
[16:34:33] <NexHD> after i set a varible to false for if statament what i do with that variable?
[16:34:53] <someprimetime> what exactly are you doing?
[16:35:34] <NexHD> my if condition is repeat
[16:35:35] <Eviltwin> I tried to get that out of him too
[16:35:41] <NexHD> and i dont want that
[16:36:30] <Eviltwin> NexHD: What is the condition?
[16:36:48] <NexHD> ($("#fname").val().length < 4)
[16:37:08] <Eviltwin> And that won't change inside your loop?
[16:37:27] <NexHD> its repeat the result
[16:37:44] <Eviltwin> I don't know what you mean by that
[16:39:25] <NexHD> my if condition is repeating...in the condition i have to add a <span>
[16:39:44] <NexHD> and that span is count every time that the if is action
[16:39:46] <Eviltwin> NexHD: Can you actually show us the code and explain what you're trying to change?
[16:39:47] <someprimetime> NexHD: can you post a fiddle or something?
[16:39:55] <Eviltwin> I'm having trouble understanding without seeing what's going on
[16:39:59] <NexHD> yes
[16:41:24] <NexHD> http://jsfiddle.net/insetpixel/8FdPE/
[16:41:52] <NexHD> that is
[16:41:55] <NexHD> check it
[16:43:37] <NexHD> i get this result jsfiddle
[16:43:38] <NexHD> Register Form
[16:43:38] <NexHD> First Name Enter your first nameEnter your first nameEnter your first name
[16:51:06] <Eviltwin> NexHD: I would do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/8FdPE/4/
[16:51:18] <NexHD> ok
[16:52:57] <NexHD> but now is not work :|
[16:53:09] <Eviltwin> NexHD: What you linked me didn't work
[16:53:21] <Eviltwin> It never changed
[16:53:39] <someprimetime> alternatively http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/8FdPE/5/
[16:54:22] <NexHD> remove the user from my link
[16:54:26] <NexHD> and try after
[16:54:39] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: That's not quite working
[16:54:46] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah just realized
[16:55:17] <Eviltwin> What you want is this: http://jsfiddle.net/8FdPE/6/
[16:55:18] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/8FdPE/7/
[16:55:28] <someprimetime> yeah
[16:55:31] <someprimetime> that's much cleaner :D
[16:55:44] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: >= on that second condition if you want it to work right :P

[18:41:32] <w00tner> im using _.each to iterate a JSON object ... but i want to filter depending of the "category" tag
[18:41:43] <w00tner>  _.each(data, function(value) {
[18:41:43] <w00tner> 		        $('#listado').append('<li><a href="#" data-id="' + value.id + '">' + value.empresa + '<p>' + value.titulo + '</p></a></li>');

[18:44:26] <w00tner> every element in the json file has a tag category
[18:44:32] <w00tner> thanks
[18:46:34] <ourmon> hello. not directly jquery-related, but i have a mainloop which uses setInterval(draw, 50); to draw verious elements on a canvas element and check for user input; i would like to trigger a independent animation of an object on a key press; i can use setTimeout(animate, 0.11); to trigger the animation, but how do i specify doing it just for n seconds?
[18:46:46] <coldhead> if (value.category != filter_category) return;
[18:47:22] <ourmon> any combination of now, then and delta or rather var myAnimation = setInterval(...); and clearInterval(myAnimation);?
[18:48:07] <austinpray> holy shit that css3 pie graph loader is amazing
[18:49:48] <w00tner> wich one
[18:49:59] <w00tner> show me master
[18:54:06] <btipling> I have a chain of prevObject referencing detached dom elements
[18:54:15] <btipling> I can see it in the chrome memory profiler
[18:54:18] <btipling> in a heap snapshot
[18:54:31] <btipling> but I can't for the life of me find it anywhere in the actual application
[18:54:37] <btipling> where the reference begins
[18:54:46] <btipling> anyone have any tips for tracking down prevObject chains?
[18:55:01] <btipling> I hate prevObject :(
[18:55:38] <btipling> it's prevObjects all the way down
[18:56:34] <btipling> https://www.evernote.com/shard/s3/sh/bca9497f-296e-47b6-ad73-f4b1cee1e03d/212490253580f9252bf773fb6941e8f1/res/38881da1-203f-485a-9e9f-9ca05cfcf77e/Leftronic_Dashboard-20120822-185607.jpg.jpg
[19:10:18] <w00tner> i think i got it if anyone cares   _.chain(collection).filter(function(value) { return (value.category == 'cat1');
[19:10:22] <w00tner> lets dance!
[19:20:32] <Stampy> Hi.  How do I convert a returned JSON response into an array?
[19:20:51] <austinpray> I need to look into that underscore js thing
[19:32:47] <prefixed> is it possible to perform a caluclation based on the location of a click within a div?
[19:33:40] <ogk1000> is this bad practice? and/or any better way to do simple animation chaining like this? http://collabedit.com/wqyqp
[19:37:04] <Eviltwin> Um, I don't think clearTimeout() by itself does anything
[19:37:07] <Eviltwin> Unless you pass in a timeout ID
[19:38:25] <ogk1000> hmm what Id would I pass?
[19:38:35] <ogk1000> the item(s) inside the setTimeout or?
[19:38:39] <Eviltwin> Well what are you trying to do
[19:38:50] <ogk1000> the onload animation on that link
[19:39:18] <Eviltwin> If you want to stop an animation you should see ?stop
[19:39:18] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[19:39:31] <ogk1000> I dont
[19:39:43] <ogk1000> so aftet setTimeout runs theres no extra resources being used?
[19:39:49] <ogk1000> no need to clear it as it only goes once?
[19:39:50] <Eviltwin> Correct
[19:40:30] <ogk1000> so my code is fine just remove clear?
[19:40:45] <ogk1000> any other suggestions?
[19:41:09] <Eviltwin> It might be clearner to use .delay()
[19:41:27] <Eviltwin> Rather than setTimeout(function(){ $('#hb #previous').animate({...})... }, 2400)
[19:41:38] <Eviltwin> You could do $('#hb #previous').delay(2400).animate({...})...
[19:41:39] <ogk1000> .delay from my experience doesnt always work
[19:42:13] <Eviltwin> Well .delay() can't do everything setTimeout can
[19:42:20] <Eviltwin> But since what you're delaying is animations
[19:42:25] <Eviltwin> You should be able to use it just fine
[19:43:57] <ogk1000> whats funny is jquery source of delay uses setTimeout anyway
[19:44:15] <Eviltwin> Not really sure how that's funny
[19:44:27] <ogk1000> because its technically the same thing
[19:44:30] <ogk1000> but I thought it was diff
[19:44:49] <Eviltwin> Well not really
[19:44:55] <ogk1000> ran into issue before and someone told me use delay.. it didnt work... i did research on what .delay is... its setTimeout anyway
[19:45:13] <ogk1000> either way thx for clarifing for me
[19:45:18] <ogk1000> any tips on when to use clearTimeout
[19:45:28] <Eviltwin> Well if I do function max(x) { return Math.max(2, x); } It's using Math.max
[19:45:38] <Eviltwin> But you can't use it to find the maximum of two numbers
[19:45:53] <Eviltwin> You can use it to find the max of some number and 2
[19:46:18] <Eviltwin> In the same way .delay() works for some cases while others it does not
[19:46:52] <ogk1000> k
[19:46:54] <ogk1000> thx for info sir
[19:47:13] <Eviltwin> You only want to use clearTimeout when you want to prevent something you did setTimeout on from happening
[19:47:24] <Eviltwin> Like var x = setTimeout(function() { ... }, 1000);
[19:47:30] <Eviltwin> If you decide you don't want that to happen any more
[19:47:34] <Eviltwin> clearTimeout(x);
[19:48:04] <Eviltwin> That's the only time
[19:51:14] <ogk1000> is there a way to not shoot the page to an ID when u set the hash with 	window.location.hash
[19:52:38] <Eviltwin> I think you can use onhashchange
[19:52:42] <Eviltwin> And prevent default
[19:53:00] <Eviltwin> But most people solve the problem by never setting the hash to something that matches an id or name on the page
[19:57:19] <rodyhaddad> Hey guys, I have a ul, that has the jquery-ui .sortable applied to it. In the li's of the ul, there might be other ul's that also have .sortable too (so 2 level ul's). The sortables are connected together, so that you can take an li from level 1 to level 2. But I want to disable the connections if the li being moved already has a ul in it. How can I do that? I don't want the user to be able to make a 3rd level
[19:59:38] <Eviltwin> You could try setting items to 'li:not(:has(ul))'
[19:59:41] <Eviltwin> Or something like that
[19:59:42] <Eviltwin> Might work
[20:03:19] <rodyhaddad> Eviltwin, that wouldn't "work". I still want the user to be able to sort li's in level 1. I just don't want him to put an li in another li if the dragged li has a level 2 :p
[20:03:45] <diegomax> why am i here?
[20:04:18] <Eviltwin> rodyhaddad: You lost me about half way through that message
[20:04:49] <Eviltwin> Can you make an example of what the layout is and what's not allowed and what is?
[20:07:11] <rodyhaddad> oh! found a way to fix it using start/stop :D (lol, sry for that, my explaining skills aren't that good :| )
[20:23:13] <oojacoboo> I love how _everything_ is a TypeError
[20:26:12] <Eviltwin> Well there are SyntaxErrors
[20:27:08] <oojacoboo> any idea why I get a typeError onâ€¦ 	if(tenantIds.indexOf("&") !== -1)
[20:27:16] <oojacoboo> where tenantIds === 1
[20:27:21] <Eviltwin> ...
[20:27:31] <Eviltwin> You're trying to indexOf a string?
[20:27:36] <Eviltwin> non-string*
[20:28:01] <oojacoboo> I guess?
[20:28:08] <oojacoboo> indexOf only works with strings?
[20:34:30] <oojacoboo> nm, I used $.isArray() instead
[20:34:55] <oojacoboo> it's probably slow as molasses but w/e
[20:39:34] <hamcore> On http://msmosso.com/sincronia, why the green background is greater than the text? If i hover it fixes
[20:44:01] <oojacoboo> hamcore, check the default css width on it
[20:44:18] <tw2113> helps that i type "rgba" and not "rbga"
[20:44:23] <hamcore> there's no default width, the .lavalamp() creates it
[20:44:26] <bung> the multiple-selector bind seems a bit simple $('.s1, .s2, .s3').on(..., whats the best way to do it with "more complex" jquery objects, like attaching the same .on() to both $('.c1', obj') and $('#id > .c2') ... put them all together and then $.each() ?
[20:44:56] <hamcore> oojacoboo the weird is when i run it right here, using apache at my localhost, it does work perfectly.
[20:45:07] <bung> im having a hard time getting good search terms to describe that, advanced group binding or whatever i dont know
[20:46:59] <oojacoboo> hamcore, I guess you have to use another element for that effect?
[20:47:22] <hamcore> no, oojacoboo, http://www.gmarwaha.com/blog/2007/08/23/lavalamp-for-jquery-lovers/
[20:47:27] <RichieEvan> Can someone maybe lead me to the right direction. I want to replace a huge chunk of content <div class="main"> with another <div class="main2>. The idea is when I click a contact link on my home page the contact form will replace the main content while the sidebar(which is the navigation) will still hold. I want it to have a nice slide in effect.
[20:47:34] <oojacoboo> hamcore, meh plugins
[20:47:47] <hamcore> oojacoboo what does explain the difference between running at my localhost and in a remote server?
[20:48:02] <oojacoboo> hamcore, I don't know, the jquery version?
[20:48:10] <oojacoboo> something this plugin relies on?
[20:48:29] <oojacoboo> obv it's calculating the width somehow, which I don't care to look into
[20:48:33] <oojacoboo> but it's doing it wrong
[20:48:36] <bung> RichieEvan: i recommend just starting with .show() .hide()
[20:48:45] <bung> get your markup and binds working to handle that
[20:49:00] <oojacoboo> hamcore, setâ€¦ ul.menu li {overflow: hidden;}
[20:49:03] <hamcore> oojacoboo, latest version
[20:49:04] <oojacoboo> see if that helps you out
[20:49:08] <hamcore> lemme try.
[20:49:10] <RichieEvan> bung: do you think I should create separate html pages or should I include all the content in one hmtl file
[20:49:32] <bung> RichieEvan: depends on your needs mate
[20:49:51] <RichieEvan> seems like I'll have to work some ajax magic if I want to work with two separate html files
[20:49:55] <bung> if you've got it on another page, you'll want to look at .load()
[20:50:00] <xyxxy> I need a function that will open a webpage, read its contents, then post these contents. Help.
[20:50:16] <hamcore> no, it doesn't, oojacoboo.
[20:50:28] <oojacoboo> hamcore, find out how it's calculating the width and fix that
[20:50:30] <RichieEvan> thanks bung <#
[20:50:31] <oojacoboo> that's all I know to tell you
[20:50:32] <RichieEvan> <3
[20:50:34] <bung> xyxxy: what have you got so far
[20:50:47] <xyxxy> <script></script>
[20:50:50] <hamcore> oojacoboo but what does explain that if i run locally it does work?
[20:51:06] <bung> you have to have started something to get help, we're not doing your homework for you
[20:51:12] <hamcore> it just happens when i send to my remote server.
[20:51:15] <oojacoboo> hamcore, ask the guy that wrote the plugin, I dunno
[20:52:12] <bung> xyxxy: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=read+page+with+jquery
[20:53:02] <hamcore> oojacoboo, got it, it's the font-face :o
[20:53:07] <bung> RichieEvan: if you don't need a seperate page (for SEO or some other reason) then keep it on the same page
[20:53:15] <oojacoboo> hamcore, are you using a special font?
[20:53:31] <RichieEvan> it's just a standard portfolio page
[20:53:38] <RichieEvan> will do then
[20:54:10] <bung> thats what i would do then
[20:54:23] <bung> the multiple-selector bind seems a bit simple $('.s1, .s2, .s3').on(..., whats the best way to do it with "more complex" jquery objects, like attaching the same .on() to both $('.c1', obj') and $('#id > .c2') ... put them all together and then $.each() ?
[20:54:45] <hamcore> oojacoboo, yes, codebold, but dunno why this makes difference
[20:55:08] <bung> think i might have to go to SO for this question *sigh* i always get yelled at on there xD
[20:55:10] <oojacoboo> hamcore, b/c it's setting a different width for the element
[20:55:22] <oojacoboo> and b/c custom fonts have to be loaded by the dom
[20:55:38] <oojacoboo> hamcore, you need to setup a callback on the completion of the font being loaded and rendered in the dom
[20:55:55] <hamcore> b/c = because?
[20:56:00] <oojacoboo> si
[20:56:57] <hamcore> could you help me no setting this callback?
[20:58:48] <oojacoboo> hamcore, https://developers.google.com/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader
[20:58:50] <oojacoboo> check that out
[20:59:16] <oojacoboo> sectionâ€¦ "Changing styles when fonts finish loading"
[20:59:52] <oojacoboo> bottom has the callbacks
[21:00:36] <hamcore> thanks, oojacoboo.
[21:36:51] <azbyin> hi all..
[21:37:34] <azbyin> I'm loading a script(in my js code) by creating a new script tag within the document tree.
[21:37:54] <coldhead> are you using getScript?
[21:38:01] <azbyin> no.. should I be?
[21:38:06] <coldhead> ?getscript
[21:38:07] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[21:38:16] <coldhead> it's nice because it lets you have a success handler
[21:38:22] <coldhead> to do something once the script is loaded
[21:38:39] <azbyin> true.. but my js that loads the external script is a bookmarklet
[21:38:43] <azbyin> and no jquery in there
[21:39:44] <azbyin> what I wanted to know is that within the loaded script, if I put an alert("script loaded successfully");  and this gets printed, then I am guaranteed that the script has been gotten and parsed by the js interpreter, right?
[21:41:16] <coldhead> azbyin: guarantee is pretty strong
[21:41:24] <coldhead> but i think you can safely assume so, yes
[21:41:47] <azbyin> well, by "guarantee" i mean the functions in the loaded script are now callable
[21:41:48] <coldhead> its received and parsed at least the bit with the alert()
[21:41:53] <coldhead> yes
[21:42:02] <azbyin> good, thats what I was after
[21:42:21] <coldhead> azbyin: let me paste you some code so you can do a success handler without jQ
[21:42:43] <azbyin> right, this would be in my bookmarklet js then..
[21:43:14] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/8Bvzz/
[21:43:39] <oojacoboo> how would I loop over a set of objects and populate serialized url friendly array?
[21:43:52] <coldhead> so then you just go getScript('someurl', function () {code_here_can_use_fns_from_the_script();});
[21:44:07] <oojacoboo> foo += this.id + "&";
[21:44:09] <azbyin> http://jsfiddle.net/VuuzM/
[21:44:36] <oojacoboo> I'd rather not append the & in that method incase it's just a single value, is there a better method for this?
[22:00:56] <shadykhan> whats the best way to write a script for saying for every 20 classes put an 2 extra classes inside randomly
[22:04:12] <pppaul> hey guys. $('my div').contentEditable() seems to not work all the time
[22:04:21] <pppaul> anyone else have issues?
[22:09:26] <Cork> pppaul: uh, that shouldn't work unless you have an extension that provide that function
[22:09:48] <pppaul> ohâ€¦ really?
[22:09:58] <pppaul> it's not part of query?
[22:10:17] <azbyin> pppaul, $("#mydiv") will select the div with id="mydiv"
[22:10:23] <pppaul> hmmm, maybe aloha is adding it
[22:10:43] <pppaul> the selector isn't my issua
[22:10:47] <pppaul> issue*
[22:10:52] <pppaul> it's .contentEditable
[22:11:07] <azbyin> huh?
[22:11:18] <pppaul> sometimes it returns true, and sometimes not, even when the attribute is set on the tag
[22:11:39] <azbyin> how could the selector not be an issue? $('my div') is asking jquery to select a tag named "my div"
[22:11:47] <Cork> pppaul: its part of dom
[22:12:01] <azbyin> (1) tags don;t have spaces, (2) there is no "my" tag even if there was no space
[22:12:08] <pppaul> ug
[22:12:13] <Cork> so $('selector').prop('contentEditable', true)
[22:12:13] <pppaul> i made up the tag
[22:12:22] <pppaul> i don't care about the selector
[22:12:27] <Cork> azbyin: its just a place holder selector
[22:12:36] <pppaul> $('sdfsdfs').contentEditable()
[22:12:38] <azbyin> ah, ok
[22:12:45] <pppaul> i care about .contentEditable
[22:12:47] <Cork> pppaul: no that would need a function added to jquery
[22:12:55] <pppaul> so, it's not in core?
[22:13:08] <azbyin> not every attribute is exposed as a function!
[22:13:20] <Cork> jquery only expose a few of the dom attributes as functions
[22:13:28] <Cork> use prop
[22:13:28] <pppaul> i'm wondering if .contentEditable is even part of JQuery
[22:13:35] <azbyin> and newer jquery even makes a proper distinction between attributes and properties
[22:13:42] <Cork> and contentEditable is a toggle, so you need to set it to true or false
[22:13:55] <pppaul> ok, i was looking at it's return
[22:14:09] <pppaul> however when i used it multiple times it returned the same value
[22:14:47] <pppaul> my code is something like this
[22:14:48] <pppaul> else if(el.contentEditable() || el.attr('contenteditable') === 'true'){
[22:14:50] <Cork> in pure js its document.getElementById('something').contentEditable = true
[22:15:05] <Cork> thats a BAD idea
[22:15:13] <pppaul> good, that's what i'm hear for
[22:15:16] <pppaul> :)
[22:15:18] <Cork> attr is what was set when the html loaded
[22:15:22] <Cork> not its current state
[22:15:27] <pppaul> ok
[22:15:54] <pppaul> should i use prop?
[22:16:00] <Cork> yes
[22:16:06] <pppaul> el.prop('contenteditable')
[22:16:21] <Cork> if(el.prop('contentEditable')) {}
[22:16:28] <pppaul> ok great
[22:16:30] <pppaul> thanks
[22:16:31] <Cork> it doesn't return a string
[22:17:02] <Cork> (or) if(!el.prop('contentEditable')) { do something else }
[22:17:06] <vectorshelve> I have a website and I want to write a plugin like FB zoom where a mouse hover would enlarge the images that are displayed as thumbnails.... are any such plugin still available ?
[22:17:24] <Cork> sure
[22:17:35] <Cork> search for image zoom
[22:17:48] <pppaul> great. works fine
[22:18:51] <vectorshelve> Cork: it works for all domains or I can specify a particular hostname /
[22:20:49] <vectorshelve> Cork: if I want to write one for my own website.. a chrome plugin... will be a huge task.. or is it easy ?
[22:21:30] <Cork> wait a min your talking about a jqeury plugin or a browser extension?
[22:21:36] <Cork> *jquery
[22:21:47] <vectorshelve> Cork: browser extension... for chrome
[22:22:15] <Cork> first. you don't write a browser extension for a site
[22:22:26] <vectorshelve> Cork: like FB zoom which is a browser extension.. I would like to develop one for my site :)
[22:22:36] <Cork> jikes...
[22:22:41] <Cork> that would really suck
[22:22:55] <Cork> why does it need to be a browser extension??
[22:23:26] <Cork> i don't see the point of making a website feature part of the browser (and thereby always loaded no matter if your on the site or not)
[22:23:34] <vectorshelve> Cork: there are users who wouldnt want the feature (hover mouse over thumbnail on timeline and image gets displayed enlarged) so it would rather be an independant browser extension :)
[22:23:51] <coldhead> Cork: you can make extensions only load for sites that match some rule
[22:24:07] <Cork> coldhead: you can make it only affect selected sites yes
[22:24:12] <Cork> but it is still loaded
[22:24:13] <vectorshelve> Cork: I mean that is the whole point and reason I thought the browser extension would make sense
[22:24:29] <Cork> vectorshelve: so show a toggle on the site, and store there option in a cookie
[22:24:46] <Cork> or localStorage or what every
[22:24:47] <Cork> *ever
[22:25:07] <Cork> vectorshelve: i don't think it makes sense at all
[22:25:58] <Cork> especially as you don't need privileged code at all to make the feature work
[22:26:02] <coldhead> laod this f yuo cry everytiem
[22:26:03] <vectorshelve> Cork: I am doing it.. since I want to give an extra feature for ppl using it outside.. and not necesarrily make it a part of the application
[22:27:00] <Cork> well an extension will be harder cause it would have to be generic in its form to be meaning full
[22:27:10] <vectorshelve> Cork: "especially as you don't need privileged code at all to make the feature work" is one reason I can have an external extension since I am not sharing any code of application outside
[22:27:11] <Cork> while if its part of the page it only has to care about that situation
[22:27:45] <Cork> vectorshelve: uh... your reading privileged code the opposite to how i meant it
[22:28:00] <Cork> privileged code is code that needs to do things a website isn't allowed
[22:28:17] <Cork> a browser extension won't ever have less privileges then your website
[22:28:46] <Cork> an extension always have full access to everything on the page
[22:28:53] <Cork> but it can also have local access
[22:29:01] <Cork> and THATS privileged code
[22:29:36] <vectorshelve> Cork: but when I develop a browser extension (in this case a image zoom for my app) wouldnt require an application specific code or API to be given out.. so it's fine from the security aspect !!
[22:29:54] <Cork> not requiered
[22:30:16] <Cork> it has full access to the dom, your js variables, js functions and no blocks what so ever
[22:30:45] <Cork> the browser only protects a site from other sites
[22:30:48] <Cork> not from extensions
[22:30:57] <vectorshelve> Cork: exactly.. so me developing it would be fine from the security perspective
[22:30:58] <Cork> (or the user)
[22:31:17] <Cork> vectorshelve: except the code would have privileges it doesn't need
[22:31:23] <vectorshelve> Cork: so how can I go about developing a chrome extension for my site thumbnail image zoom ?
[22:31:25] <vectorshelve> Cork: yes
[22:31:29] <Cork> ...
[22:31:39] <Cork> so thats why it has security problems
[22:32:13] <Cork> your extension would have access to the users browser, when theres absolutely no need for that
[22:32:35] <Cork> and to make it even worse you would have to make it browser specific, when theres no need for that either
[22:33:35] <vectorshelve> Cork: most of my app users are in chrome.. and this is an independent thing I am developing and its got nothing to do with the app development side at all
[22:33:40] <Cork> it could just a simple be included as a separate js file on your site, default to off, and a simple toggle thats tags the users session to activate it
[22:34:05] <Cork> vectorshelve: i don't see how that makes it a good candidate or an extension anyway
[22:34:37] <Cork> it only means the user has to give away more trust then needed, and an extra installation step
[22:34:52] <Cork> completely pointless
[22:35:14] <vectorshelve> Cork: so why do you think FB zoom is a huge success ? :)
[22:35:39] <coldhead> because you can see people's private areas up close?
[22:36:11] <Cork> vectorshelve: casue FB users most of the time have no clue what security is
[22:36:48] <Cork> how else would fb get away with defaulting everything to public
[22:36:50] <vectorshelve> Cork: good one :D
[22:37:36] <Cork> (except for email that they rout over there servers, OH YAH, ;P)
[22:39:00] <vectorshelve> Cork: hmm cool... so http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/ how can I actually apply the zoom feature on mouse hover for this ?
[22:39:41] <Cork> vectorshelve: like this?
[22:39:50] <Cork> its just an image tag
[22:40:25] <Cork> anyway yes theres js code on the net that let you make images zoomed when you hover them
[22:40:31] <Cork> it doesn't need any extra markup or anything
[22:40:31] <vectorshelve> Cork: yes the js for zooming it on mouse hover
[22:41:08] <Cork> ?g jquery zoom image on hover
[22:41:09] <bot-t> Cork, Hover Image Zoom With JQuery - http://superdit.com/2011/06/11/hover-image-zoom-with-jquery/

[22:51:20] <vectorshelve> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/AGKST/7/ in this code the width enlarges first and then height how to correct it.. to make both trasition happen simultaneously
[22:51:24] <Cork> Ariel_Calzada: if anyones around and know the answer they'll anser
[22:51:27] <Cork> *answer
[22:51:45] <Cork> vectorshelve: combine them?
[22:52:39] <vectorshelve> Cork: how to combine it.. I just a kid in jquery not a king like you :)
[22:52:39] <Ariel_Calzada> ok i have a jquery datatables, every row have a radiobutton the problem is that the first row is never shown checked but inside in the html is see the attribute checked="checked" any idea?
[22:52:49] <Cork> vectorshelve: first argument to animate takes an object with any number of css values to animate
[22:53:39] <vectorshelve> Cork: not getting you :(
[22:54:13] <Cork> vectorshelve: your calling animate two times with an object with either height or width
[22:54:25] <Cork> make a combined object and call animate once
[22:56:15] <kamoricks> JQuery UI tabs don't seem to obey max-width when in a floated div. Any ideas why?
[22:56:23] <vectorshelve> Cork: error in this line ->     $(this).animate({width: "500px"}, 'slow',{height: "500px"}, 'slow');
[22:56:31] <Cork> uh...
[22:56:57] <Cork> an an object is { key:val, key:val,key:val }
[22:58:16] <Cork> vectorshelve: i hope you know what an javascript object is?
[22:58:23] <vectorshelve> Cork: yes
[22:58:37] <vectorshelve> Cork: I am trying to pass to animate the attributes
[22:59:08] <Cork> so give the animate one object with both values in
[23:00:14] <vectorshelve> Cork: can u corect me on the syntax please.. i am getting it wrong
[23:00:46] <Cork> are you kidding me??
[23:06:21] <vectorshelve> Cork: why ?
[23:08:09] <onats> hi all, there is one div section that i would like to float, similar to the affix function of bootstrap. what should i look at / google for?
[23:09:28] <bacilla> vectorshelve: 'cause if you really know what an object is, and what "animate" requires as arguments, it should be obvious :) $(this).animate({ property: value, property: value}, slow);
[23:09:50] <vectorshelve> bacilla: sorry got confused
[23:11:15] <bacilla> happens to the best of us :)
[23:17:30] <scathen^C> hey all, ive written some simple code to animate my tiled background panning over the entire page. I've tried both canvas and css, and both work pretty well, but there is still some slight jittering sometimes. Any ideas what would eb the most efficient way to animate this?
[23:19:31] <devslash> is anyone actively here
[23:19:52] <FFForever> Good evening/morning
[23:20:28] <Cork> scathen^C: the jitter prob comes from the gc, and there isn't too much you can do about that, except try to reduce the amount of new memory you use
[23:20:36] <Cork> ?ask @ devslash
[23:20:37] <bot-t> devslash, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:21:02] <devslash> my site is mms-test.no-ip.org. i want to get the root attribute of the file tree . how do i do that ?
[23:21:15] <Cork> root attribute?
[23:21:25] <devslash> yea
[23:21:32] <devslash> its basically the current path of the file tree
[23:21:33] <Cork> devslash: you need to back up a bit and give the full picture :)
[23:21:47] <bacilla> devslash: I'm guessing you're looking for el.attr('root');
[23:21:49] <bacilla> :)
[23:21:57] <Cork> uh... no
[23:22:15] <sente> devslash: nice site
[23:22:21] <devslash> thanks
[23:22:25] <Cork> devslash: if you want to reference an image relative to the html page use 'file-name.png')
[23:22:31] <FFForever> What's the best way to do an automated accordion menu that won't go nuts when you're moving the mouse up at an accelerated speed?
[23:22:38] <devslash> no
[23:22:41] <devslash> not an image
[23:22:57] <Cork> devslash: so you need to give the full picture, like i said :)
[23:23:00] <FFForever> Hmm would it be possible to see if the mouse is still overing over an object 200ms later?
[23:23:05] <devslash> what else do you need to know
[23:23:09] <devslash> I've told you everything
[23:23:12] <Cork> what are you trying to do
[23:23:20] <devslash> get the root attribute of the file tree
[23:23:20] <Cork> the answer depends on where its used
[23:23:25] <FFForever> Cork, me?
[23:23:31] <Cork> FFForever: no
[23:23:36] <devslash> like $('#myMusicStreamer_fileTree').root
[23:23:45] <Cork> ah
[23:24:00] <Cork> heh then bacilla's answer is correct
[23:24:07] <devslash> el doesn't exist
[23:24:25] <Cork> devslash: thats psudo code
[23:24:36] <Cork> el is referenced to the element
[23:24:39] <devslash> that doesn't help me i dunno what that means
[23:24:49] <devslash> using document.getElementById ?
[23:24:51] <Cork> $('#myMusicStreamer_fileTree') would be el in your example
[23:25:55] <devslash> $('#myMusicStreamer_fileTree').attr('root'); returns undefined
[23:26:36] <Cork> ya, cause it doesn't have a root attribute
[23:26:49] <devslash> it does.
