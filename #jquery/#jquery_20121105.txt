[00:00:01] <tw2113> say that this is your submit button element
[00:00:12] <tw2113> <input type="submit" id="foo">
[00:00:27] <Cork> X-Raimo: $('*[data-tr="loc[str.]"]')
[00:00:38] <tw2113> you could use $('#foo').on('submit',function() { //in here is where you interact with the data });
[00:00:38] <X-Raimo> Cork: yes. In this example: data-tr="loc[str.n]" - valid, data-tr="loc[str.m]" - valid, data-tr="loc[str11.n]" - not valid
[00:00:38] <zend_dev> ya that i understand
[00:00:51] <zend_dev> but how do i submit my form data
[00:01:04] <zend_dev> i am using ajax call online
[00:01:06] <tw2113> as Cork has been saying, how you do that step isn't important
[00:01:09] <zend_dev> not refreshing page
[00:01:10] <Cork> zend_dev: $.ajax $.post or what ever
[00:01:15] <Cork> that doens't matter for the history
[00:01:20] <tw2113> the interception of the data is what you need to worry about first
[00:01:45] <Clorith> tw2113: couldn't you also do <form id="foo"> and $("#foo").submit(function (e) { whatever }); ?
[00:02:03] <Cork> Clorith: yes, but i don't think he got that far yet :)
[00:02:04] <tw2113> probably
[00:02:11] <zend_dev> ok wait i am trying this
[00:02:16] <tw2113> it's 2am, i shuold get to bed before too long
[00:02:20] <zend_dev> and than tell you if not done
[00:02:29] <zend_dev> ok thanks
[00:02:37] <zend_dev> i am from india
[00:02:42] <Clorith> Ahh all right, I just asked because I was worried I had been doing it terribly wrong my self before :P
[00:03:01] <Cork> Clorith: nope, thats what you should be doing
[00:03:23] <Cork> the form submit event should always be of type submit, and always be on a form tag
[00:03:38] <zend_dev> ok
[00:03:43] <Cork> else you will break features of the browser (for example the history)
[00:03:51] <X-Raimo> Cork: doesn't works
[00:04:25] <Cork> X-Raimo: $('*[data-tr="loc[str.]"]') will find the element <div data-tr="loc[str.]"></div> for example
[00:04:34] <Clorith> I wonder if my ajax issue is related ot my form initially being of multipart/form-data and supposed ot also be able to include an image
[00:04:53] <mazzachre> Cork: That is about as slow a request as you can make
[00:04:57] <Cork> Clorith: what is your form problem?
[00:05:03] <Cork> mazzachre: i know
[00:05:16] <Clorith> Hmm, I'm doing a .ajax() call in a script, works fine in chrome but in IE I get an "Invalid argument" error, not quite sure what it could be related to. Put my jQuery up at http://jsfiddle.net/9Z5P5/1/ and the output of the console log/dir's are there as well
[00:05:16] <Cork> mazzachre: but the question was specifically for that
[00:06:11] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya ok... Just saw that as first line after login :) We had similar stuff (and worse) in the code I am workign on now, so I am trying my best to unwind the code, make plugins and remove the worse slowdowns..
[00:06:12] <Cork> Clorith: uh... why don't you just use serialize? see ?.serialize
[00:06:14] <bot-t> Clorith, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[00:06:34] <Clorith> Cork: Because I'm a dumb :P
[00:06:49] <Cork> mazzachre: that kind of selector is actually "ok" if you limit the scope it works on
[00:06:59] <Cork> mazzachre: like $('#id').find('')
[00:07:22] <Cork> but ya, if you can avoid it its preferable (like with a class)
[00:07:36] <Cork> and most of the time, thats what you should do, but its not always possible
[00:08:32] <mazzachre> Cork: I know, but the ones we had were really f*cked... Like $('*[data-something-something]').find('input, select, textarea')...
[00:08:43] <Clorith> Cork: rpelaced my silly loops with .serialize() but same output though
[00:09:27] <Cork> mazzachre: ouch
[00:09:37] <Cork> mazzachre: i have one like that actually :)
[00:09:53] <Cork> but its a fallback selector so i'm not too afraid for it
[00:10:27] <Cork> if(!$.support.placeholder) { $('input[placeholder], textarea[placeholder]') }
[00:10:32] <Cork> (shortend)
[00:11:12] <Cork> thats mainly for old ie's so... who cares, not like that browsers fast anyway
[00:11:59] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya, the best thing about that selector from before.... It was run on every page (where the writer had remembered to put a <script>initializePageElements()</script> at the bottom (Which makes it even slower... sigh)
[00:12:11] <Clorith> http://jsfiddle.net/9Z5P5/2/ There we go, now with pretty .serialize xD
[00:13:48] <Cork> Clorith: and wher doe "Error: Ugyldig argument." come from?
[00:14:01] <Cork> *does
[00:14:10] <Clorith> Cork: The error part of my .ajax() call
[00:14:18] <Clorith> "That's Error: Invalid argument" in Norwegian
[00:14:22] <Cork> wtf
[00:14:24] <Cork> LOL
[00:14:28] <Cork> ok
[00:15:11] <Cork> Clorith: statusText : "Error: Ugyldig argument."
[00:15:20] <Cork> actually you're sure thats not from the server?
[00:15:31] <Cork> looks like it might be
[00:15:53] <Clorith> It's jsut so odd that the server would be saying that when IE makes the ajax call but not any other browser
[00:16:20] <Cork> Clorith: just check the log from the server
[00:16:36] <Cork> should make it much easier to diagnose if you know if its the server or not
[00:20:38] <zend_dev> cok: i used form tag
[00:20:40] <Clorith> Peculiar, I do have some weird error in my server logs "Asynchronous AcceptEx failed"
[00:20:43] <Clorith> To the googles!
[00:21:05] <zend_dev> and button with type=submit and its onclick event i handel my js function
[00:21:19] <Cork> sigh
[00:21:40] <zend_dev> but not any progress
[00:21:55] <zend_dev> it not store any where
[00:22:04] <Cork> ya, cause you still haven't read the responses you've gotten...
[00:22:16] <Cork> read through them again
[01:05:43] <MrMister> none of the _on events are working for me in jquery.ui.menubar.js, specifically the menus do not close automatically on mouseleave when autoExpand is enabled. Has anyone else experienced this?
[01:11:47] <Cork> the _on events?
[01:13:04] <Cork> MrMister: could you elaborate what you mean by _on events?
[01:15:18] <MrMister> sure, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/menubar/ui/jquery.ui.menubar.js
[01:15:46] <MrMister> none of the events in the 'that._on' block trigger
[01:15:58] <Cork> ah
[01:16:10] <Cork> though you meant you tried to bind an event :)
[01:16:15] <Cork> *thought
[01:17:32] <Cork> MrMister: well as the code state autoExpand is explicitly excluded when it tries to close
[01:17:46] <Cork> if ( that.options.autoExpand ) { <--
[01:20:28] <sriyani_> how can i show alert message box middle in browser window?
[01:21:38] <Cork> sriyani_: alert is shown where the browser chooses to put htem
[01:21:42] <Cork> *them
[01:22:29] <Cork> sriyani_: you could use js html based popups instead though
[01:22:44] <Cork> but they'll behave a bit differently then normal alerts
[01:30:57] <MrMister> Cork, I have autoExpand set to true (the default is false, but I initialize with that option)
[01:31:27] <Cork> ah, sorry i read it backwards >_<'
[01:31:33] <MrMister> no prob.
[01:31:41] <Cork> do you have a demo page?
[01:32:35] <MrMister> but even so, if I put a console.log after line 174, I would expect to see it when mouseleave exits .ui-menubar-item
[01:33:13] <MrMister> unfortunately I don't have a demo page that can be shown. I'm working on making a jsfiddle that I can show and is available to the public
[01:34:28] <Cork> MrMister: do you know where it gets it's _on function from?
[01:34:50] <Cork> as far as i know that syntax those lines use doesn't exist
[01:34:54] <MrMister> http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_on
[01:35:44] <Cork> ah var match = event.match( /^(\w+)\s*(.*)$/ )
[01:35:53] <Cork> missed that meaning
[01:37:23] <sriyani_> Cork, thanks, you mean i create custom alert box
[01:37:41] <Cork> MrMister: might be worth reproducing it with a clean testcase (ex. in jsfiddle)
[01:38:04] <Cork> MrMister: from what it looks like to me it should work, unless something somewhere does stopPropagation
[01:38:17] <zhulikas> http://pastebin.com/ZikXy3DH
[01:38:21] <zhulikas> first line is a request I make
[01:38:23] <Cork> sriyani_: yes
[01:38:25] <zhulikas> later on is a resulting object
[01:38:27] <zhulikas> what's wrong? :|
[01:39:20] <Cork> zhulikas: uh you're going a get request without handling the response
[01:39:37] <Cork> ah promise
[01:40:18] <Cork> zhulikas: do you have the actual code you're suing instead of a minimized console dump?
[01:40:24] <Cork> *using
[01:40:42] <zhulikas> not yet
[01:41:28] <Cork> cause that block of gibberish is hard to make anything out of
[01:41:35] <Clorith> Moved m yajax off my local machine to another networked one that isn't winblows ... this time no errors are logged at all but I'm still having the same result about invalid arguments =/
[01:41:48] <zhulikas> well, I am watching network traffic through chrome tools
[01:41:53] <zhulikas> it seems to be redirecting a call
[01:41:58] <zhulikas> and then failing
[01:42:09] <CathaliN> I have a dropdown list and a grid.. in the grid the column header title should change every time I select a different value from dropdown with that value's text.. how to do that?
[01:42:21] <Cork> Clorith: so you know it doesn't happen server side now?
[01:42:29] <zhulikas> ok, now I have somehting...
[01:42:30] <zhulikas> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.google.dk/. Origin http://api.jquery.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[01:42:40] <Clorith> Cork: Indeed, took a while thoug hbecause i had ot make sure
[01:43:00] <Cork> zhulikas: exactly, so you're trying to fetch from another domain, that doens't allow you to do that
[01:43:10] <Cork> zhulikas: the browser is blocking you
[01:43:19] <zhulikas> hmm
[01:43:29] <zhulikas> so I am supposed to do only local ajax calls?
[01:43:34] <coppa> yup
[01:43:37] <Cork> local to the same domain yes
[01:43:38] <zhulikas> didn't know that
[01:44:02] <Cork> Clorith: do you have the pb again?
[01:44:14] <zhulikas> so, let's say I actually need external resources... I need to make some script (let's say php) which makes a call for me and then I do a local ajax call from javascript to my script
[01:44:15] <zhulikas> correct?
[01:44:35] <coppa> zhulikas: there is that otherwise https://github.com/padolsey/jQuery-Plugins/tree/master/cross-domain-ajax
[01:44:55] <Cork> zhulikas: yes, unless the service you try to access allow cross domain access (either through cors or jsonp or similar)
[01:45:02] <zhulikas> I see
[01:45:06] <zhulikas> thanks
[01:45:26] <zhulikas> alternative is to figure out how to make custom google api requests
[01:45:28] <zhulikas> anyone familiar with that?
[01:45:33] <zhulikas> google api javascript client
[01:45:49] <Cork> coppa: that only works for js/jsonp calls
[01:45:50] <zhulikas> because I can do google api requests in javascript already so I assume it allows cross domain access
[01:46:04] <zhulikas> but I need to make a custom one to a different google domain
[01:46:04] <jae> wow
[01:46:09] <jae> hi guys
[01:46:14] <Hooloovoo> hi jae!
[01:46:19] <jae> :D
[01:46:51] <jae> i was wondering if you guys can help me pinpoint a problem
[01:46:53] <Cork> zhulikas: you load the script from there domain so you cross the boundary though that
[01:47:03] <jae> all i need to know what the problem is called
[01:47:08] <CathaliN> did anyone saw what I've writted?
[01:47:15] <zhulikas> hmmm
[01:47:38] <jae> basically, i have a few animations with callbacks that trigger on click
[01:48:01] <jae> problem is, when i click too fast, the callbacks don't get called
[01:48:11] <Clorith> Cork, certainly: http://jsfiddle.net/9Z5P5/2/
[01:48:15] <Cork> CathaliN: give the title you want to change an id and on change + keypress trigger the change
[01:48:50] <Cork> Clorith: what content-type is the server responding with?
[01:49:05] <jae> do you have any clue Hooloovoo ?
[01:49:11] <Hooloovoo> jae: you have a example?
[01:49:17] <jae> yeah
[01:49:46] <Clorith> Cork: I've no idea to be completely honest, how would I grab that piece of information?
[01:50:01] <Cork> Clorith: check the net tab in your browser
[01:50:10] <Cork> Clorith: you're looking for the response headers
[01:50:26] <jae> vic3bangkok.com
[01:50:33] <jae> try click the menus real fast
[01:50:45] <jae> the slides gets messed up
[01:50:53] <jae> the content inside doesn't fade out, etc
[01:50:54] <Cork> Clorith: ex. Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
[01:51:21] <Clorith> You mena if I manually store the form?
[01:51:28] <Hooloovoo> well, the way to fix that is either very carefully making the completed callbacks
[01:51:28] <Cork> no
[01:51:33] <Hooloovoo> or lock the click while animating
[01:51:37] <Cork> wait ouch you said this only happend in ie right?
[01:51:42] <Clorith> Yeah
[01:51:46] <Clorith> works like a charm in every other browser
[01:51:49] <Cork> heh
[01:52:26] <jae> is there away to queue or whatver?
[01:52:26] <Cork> hmm actually you're sure ie supports console.dir?
[01:52:45] <Clorith> Yeah
[01:52:50] <Hooloovoo> jae: simple way is when you press click on any link you do something like lock = true;
[01:52:59] <Cork> Clorith: anyway what type of data is in saved?
[01:53:03] <Hooloovoo> and on complete you set lock = false
[01:53:07] <Cork> just text? json?
[01:53:12] <Clorith> just text
[01:53:19] <jae> i'll try that Hooloovoo
[01:53:21] <jae> thanks
[01:53:22] <Hooloovoo> and only do the animation if lock == false
[01:53:27] <Cork> Clorith: might be an encoding problem
[01:53:36] <Cork> Clorith: have you tried changing what the server sends back?
[01:53:41] <Cork> to something static?
[01:54:32] <Cork> (and preferable with only english characters in it)
[01:54:44] <Clorith> Yeah, it never shows the static content
[01:54:50] <mazzachre> I am using drag&drop (jQueryUI) and have some issues with the order the "over" and "out" events are called... Anyone else have those problems? (In large grids with many droppables next to eachother) I am using this toggle a class to show if the element is droppable here or not, but it sometimes flicks over so it show sthe wrong value for a while
[01:54:58] <Cork> Clorith: and you still get the same error?
[01:55:03] <Clorith> Yeah
[01:56:01] <Cork> Clorith: ok, that's as far as i get without access
[01:56:37] <Cork> and that would have to be more access then i would like to get :)
[01:56:49] <Clorith> Yeah :P
[01:56:59] <Clorith> And more than I would like to give I'm afraid
[01:57:08] <Cork> ya, i hope so :)
[01:57:39] <Cork> Clorith: but check encodings, try to simplify the code
[01:57:48] <Cork> ex. call a static file that doens't send anything special
[01:57:52] <Cork> and so on
[01:58:09] <Cork> reduce the sections until you can find a single nominator that triggers it
[01:58:28] <Cork> sadly thats often what you have to do for ie
[02:08:21] <DarsVaeda> I have a div and another element in another div, how do I select that inner div?
[02:08:47] <DarsVaeda> $("outerDiv > innerDiv") or something
[02:08:49] <jae> $('div > ele > div')
[02:09:04] <jae> can u put classes on it?
[02:09:05] <Cork> or just $('div ele div')
[02:09:05] <DarsVaeda> is it possible without "ele"?
[02:09:15] <jae> yes dars, but can u put classes on it
[02:09:19] <jae> it'll help alot
[02:09:46] <DarsVaeda> hmm yes but then the question is obsolete ^^
[02:10:12] <jae> i don't get i
[02:10:24] <DarsVaeda> cause then I know how to select it
[02:10:42] <jae> $('outerDiv div.div')
[02:17:02] <DarsVaeda> ok thanks
[02:19:26] <Hapzz> hey, i've written some changes to my jquery code, and it stopped working
[02:19:31] <Hapzz> firefox's console has no errors in it
[02:20:16] <Hapzz> what do i do?
[02:20:54] <Cork> Hapzz: my psychic powers is a bit hazy to day, so we need to see the code to tell
[02:21:38] <Hapzz> i won't be that simple to start pasting that stuff:(
[02:21:43] <Hapzz> bunch of files
[02:21:52] <Hapzz> it worked before the changes, but i don't knwo wheres the issue now
[02:22:04] <Hapzz> s/i/it
[02:22:27] <Hapzz> the IDE doesn't bitch about any syntax errors
[02:22:38] <Cork> Hapzz: so check through your revisions and see what you changed
[02:22:44] <Cork> and change them back one at a time
[02:22:58] <Cork> when the problem goes away you know what caused it
[02:26:03] <Hapzz> been there, done that
[02:26:04] <Hapzz> i'm lost :(
[02:26:39] <Cork> so if you revert to the changeset before you made the changes it still fails?
[02:26:45] <jae> Hapzz, it's on line 192
[02:26:49] <jae> delete that line
[02:26:50] <Cork> lol
[02:26:52] <jae> then you're good
[02:27:15] <Hapzz> jae :)
[02:27:34] <Hapzz> Cork i revert part of them at the time, and it still fails, in all tries
[02:27:48] <anli> If I want to read width() of a certain class, I need to create a hidden div of that class and use .width(), right?
[02:28:06] <jae> hapzz, use breakpoints dammit
[02:28:23] <Cork> anli: you mean the width specified for the class in the css file?
[02:28:31] <jae> anli, classes don't have width
[02:28:38] <Cork> jae: they might
[02:28:39] <anli> Cork: yes
[02:28:49] <jae> an object with the class yes
[02:28:53] <Cork> ?mdc styleSheets @ anli
[02:28:53] <jae> but not the class itself
[02:28:53] <Hapzz> okay i found it. php is injecting values for some jquery function
[02:28:56] <anli> Please, understand
[02:28:57] <bot-t> anli, stylesheet - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/stylesheet
[02:29:02] <Hapzz> and the sql table was empty, so it didn't inject anything
[02:29:05] <Hapzz> hence jquery failing
[02:29:25] <Hapzz> i kinda hate javascript not telling me where it's failing
[02:29:41] <Cork> bah
[02:29:44] <Cork> anli: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.styleSheets
[02:29:49] <jae> damn so many simple questions
[02:29:58] <jae> how does this channel survive
[02:30:05] <Cork> jae: you missed the point of the question
[02:30:27] <jae> i got it,
[02:30:37] <jae> just weirdly worded
[02:30:44] <Cork> not really
[02:31:03] <jae> he wants to get width specified in the css file
[02:32:34] <jae> anli, u don't even need to create a hidden DIV
[02:32:45] <jae> u can just create one in memory
[02:41:15] <Hapzz> how can i depend some jquery method on an if (table-isnt-empty)?
[02:41:30] <Hapzz> like, only if the table has at least 1 row, then bind a .click or something
[02:41:52] <Cork> best is prob to check that inside the click event
[02:42:21] <Hapzz> the click was an example, it's some custom table sorting thing
[02:42:22] <Cork> else you would have to bind/rebind everything as soon as something changes
[02:42:35] <Hapzz> and it's all failing when the table is empty
[02:42:40] <Hapzz> and breaks all the js in the page
[02:42:40] <andolf_> Hail, i need some help with a problem I'm having with jquery.. Can someone inbox me?
[02:42:51] <Hapzz> andolf_ inbox you? just ask
[02:42:57] <Cork> ?ask @ andolf_
[02:42:57] <bot-t> andolf_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:44:19] <jae> why is it that animation callbacks don't trigger when another animation starts inbetween
[02:44:24] <Cork> Hapzz: the code that fails should check if the table is empty
[02:44:52] <Cork> Hapzz: you're talking about a dynamic situation, and you can't globally wrap a bunch of code for that state
[02:45:01] <andolf_> hello?
[02:45:16] <Cork> andolf_: see bot-t's response
[02:45:35] <andolf_> Oh yeah, didn't see that, lulll
[02:45:37] <andolf_> anyways..
[02:46:28] <andolf_> I have a form. Well, I say form.. its like 5 or 6 forms put into one and is now slip. I've used jQuery to seperate them though, and put them into stages.
[02:46:29] <Cork> Hapzz: but the check could be something like $('#table-id tr').length > 0
[02:46:44] <Cork> Hapzz: but you're question is a bit to generic to give a good answer to
[02:47:06] <Cork> jae: you mean another animation on the same element?
[02:47:11] <andolf_> Now, my offline version that I made worked perfectly fine, but when I amended it to the live version of the website its on, everytime they click on the "next" button, the next div currently disappears
[02:47:23] <andolf_> but, it slides up and displays on the offline version
[02:47:31] <jae> Cork, nah it's another element, but using the same animation function
[02:47:55] <boulet101010_>  http://jsfiddle.net/bKPgc/ how to say to the function that the argument should be the element where the button is contained ? (don't want to use element.parent("li") in the function
[02:47:59] <Cork> jae: can't say i've seen that no, check so you don't have any global variable references
[02:48:15] <andolf_> I  can pastebin my code, if you need it? and provide screenshots
[02:48:19] <jae> nah don't have any, wanna see it live?
[02:48:56] <Cork> jae: could give it a look, no garantee i'll find anything though
[02:49:14] <Cork> andolf_: it might be a race condition
[02:49:18] <jae> vic3bangkok.com try clicking two menus in succession
[02:49:25] <Cork> andolf_: and the extra load time for the net makes it fail
[02:49:26] <jae> Cork, no worries, thanks for your help
[02:49:54] <jae> code is on lines 50 - 74
[02:50:31] <Cork> jae: your loading jquery-ui after your own code, that can be a bit risky
[02:50:49] <jae> ok let me shift that
[02:51:03] <Cork> shouldn't matter here though
[02:51:05] <Cork> just a warning
[02:51:09] <jae> k
[02:51:22] <miphe> Hi all
[02:51:43] <miphe> Im upgrading from 1.7.1 to 1.8.2 and am having some breaking with .load function
[02:51:53] <miphe> Cant find any change in it
[02:52:17] <miphe> Im looking for a change log so I know how to adapt the way I use .load()
[02:52:29] <andolf_> Yeah, I tried to see if there is any errors or anything stopping it from working, but nothing comes up, well on firebug.. and the addon that displays jquery errors
[02:52:33] <andolf_> @ Cork
[02:52:34] <Cork> jae: you're talking about the close function?
[02:52:41] <jae> yes cork
[02:52:43] <jae> and the open
[02:52:48] <jae> it has a callback that fades div.content
[02:53:13] <jae> however, if u 'interupt' that sequence
[02:53:17] <jae> it's not going to fade out
[02:54:18] <boulet101010_> anyone got ideas?
[02:54:27] <jae> simple case would be just double clicking a menu item
[02:56:12] <Cork> jae: sorry it needs a bit too much digging and can't stray from work for that long
[02:56:17] <jae> haha
[02:56:20] <jae> that's ok Cork
[02:56:24] <jae> thanks anyway mate
[02:56:28] <Cork> np
[02:58:11] <Cork> boulet101010_: don't really understand you're question
[02:58:41] <Cork> boulet101010_: where do you want to find what?
[03:00:05] <Cork> boulet101010_: btw you should ALWAYS define your variables
[03:00:16] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/bKPgc/1/
[03:05:36] <Clorith> Managed ot trace down the reason for the unhelpful error message; In IE my formUrl variable isn't populated at all, now I just need to find out why not and employ a fix :D
[03:05:59] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone does anyone have expierience with html5 boilerplate and jquery touch?
[03:06:11] <jarr0dsz> also jqtouch im a bit confused if the 2 are not conflicting each other
[03:06:20] <jae> the amount of ppl that come here is staggering
[03:06:24] <jae> O_O
[03:06:30] <Cork> Clorith: you got to live ie :)
[03:06:42] <Cork> jae: today is a bit more busy then normal
[03:06:47] <Cork> but ya its a steady stream
[03:06:50] <Clorith> Is anyone else psyched about that gorgeous new look on the jQueryUI site? (just had to get that out there!)
[03:07:22] <jae> i know im new here
[03:07:26] <jarr0dsz> jquery is hot ;)
[03:07:28] <jae> and i probably shouldn't say this
[03:07:38] <jae> but the new jquery UI looks like shit
[03:07:41] <Cork> Clorith: love parts of it less enthusiastic about other parts; its an api site for me so don't really care how it looks as long as it does it's job
[03:07:50] <jae> the color i mean
[03:08:11] <jae> spoken like a true coder
[03:08:27] <Clorith> Cork, I agree some bits are a bit "wonky" like when wantign to look at different elements of a function, but in general it's jsut so nice and inviting compared to what it was
[03:08:55] <Clorith> Granted I agree with jae on the color, it's a bit...dirty...
[03:09:07] <Cork> Clorith: what i like most is that its now possible to link to the different event defenitions and the like, that was REALLY annoying before
[03:09:15] <Cork> agreed
[03:09:19] <Cork> (the color)
[03:09:28] <jae> yellow would have been better
[03:09:33] <jae> this is diahheraa ppl
[03:09:38] <Cork> ya, that would have been to bright
[03:09:40] <Cork> *na
[03:09:42] <Cork> lol
[03:10:05] <Clorith> I see why the yused the orange-y color, since it's always bee nthe "jQuery-ui color"
[03:10:13] <Clorith> But it doens't work as well i nthis situations
[03:10:18] <Clorith> s/situations/situation
[03:10:19] <Cork> i think they'r trying to aim for a gold like color
[03:10:22] <Cork> but missing a bit
[03:10:54] <jae> the site looks decent except for the color
[03:11:02] <Clorith> I like that they use WordPress
[03:11:08] <Cork> lol
[03:11:18] <Cork> i hate wordpress but... everyone for there taste :)
[03:11:31] <Clorith> I love it :P
[03:13:20] <timing> you know what I hate about wordpress. ABSOLUTE URLS in the database!
[03:13:21] <Clorith> Ok I'm a bit uncertain abotu the terminology here, what would yo ucall it when you assign a variabl with a $ sign infront of it? (Like in my case; var $form = $(this).closest('autosave'); )
[03:13:37] <Clorith> I need to find out if IE has any known problems with that as my best guess is that's where the root of my troubles lie
[03:13:44] <Cork> timing: sadly thats true for moste cms systems
[03:14:11] <Cork> Clorith: "assign a variable"
[03:14:18] <Cork> $ has no special meaning in js
[03:14:22] <timing> Cork: you would think they learn from eachother's mistakes
[03:14:32] <Cork> Clorith: its just a naming standard that some prefer to follow
[03:14:36] <Clorith> Cork: oh, I've always used $ if I'm "referencing" a jquery selector
[03:14:49] <Cork> Clorith: many do
[03:15:03] <Cork> but its just that, its up to you, for the code it has no meaning
[03:15:03] <Clorith> ok, I've always been of the belief that it's the defacto way of doing it
[03:15:12] <Clorith> All right, cheers
[03:16:16] <Clorith> I'm learnign a ton today :D
[03:16:57] <Clorith> Wow, I'm dumb
[03:17:40] <Clorith> simplest solution in the world, it's because IE doens't work well if you use form action=""> without specifying the current location (it's gotten better at defaulting to the current page, but it's still dodgy)
[03:17:53] <Clorith> I'll go sit my self down i nthe dumbass corner =)
[03:18:04] <Cork> lol
[03:18:21] <Cork> Clorith: don't beat your self down, just learn from it :)
[03:18:24] <Clorith> So glad I haven't been struggelign with this for 5 hours
[03:19:51] <Clorith> Works like a charm now, hahaha
[03:20:14] <Clorith> Thanks for all the input and help though, it is very much appreciated
[03:21:13] <EnginA> what do you think would be the easiest way to get the html of top level foo in "<foo a="b" c="d"><bar/></foo>" excluding the bar. i.e. the desired output is "<foo a="b" c="d"/>"
[03:21:29] <EnginA> I could .clone, .remove and .html.
[03:28:47] <andolf_> Cork, you there?
[03:43:41] <hetii> Hello :)
[03:44:27] <hetii> How can i replace one div content with another?  i try it by :$("#intro").replaceWith($("#ourwork"));
[03:46:38] <Mohsen_Hassani> If I populate a div using $("my_div").html('SOME_STUFF'); What will happen to the content which was already in that div? Won't it cause overload or lower speed in the browser if I use a lot .html(' ')?
[03:46:41] <xec_> hetii: that should work, depending on what you're really trying to achieve
[03:47:16] <xec_> hetii: if you want to copy the content from ourwork you could use .clone() or .html() instead
[03:47:57] <xec_> hetii: but then you'd have two divs with the same ID, which is invalid (and undesirable)
[03:48:30] <hetii> i have a div container and inside have 3 divs and then depends on the link that will be clicked i need display proper div.
[03:48:41] <xec_> ?demo @ hetii
[03:48:41] <bot-t> hetii, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:49:40] <xec_> hetii: this is what i meant by using .html() by the way http://jsfiddle.net/zTBFK/
[03:55:38] <hetii> xec_: yep this is what i expect, almost :)
[03:58:21] <xec_> Mohsen_Hassani: i'm not quite sure what you're asking. are you having performance issues?
[03:58:42] <Mohsen_Hassani> xec, exactly!
[03:58:44] <Mohsen_Hassani> :)
[03:59:43] <xec_> Mohsen_Hassani: you could use .empty() instead, but i doubt using .html() would be an issue
[03:59:54] <xec_> .html('')*
[04:00:08] <Mohsen_Hassani> xec, Thanks! :)
[04:02:48] <hetii> xec_: works almost in the way that i expect but how can i mark unused div to be not displayed. your example also act like it do the clone so have it twice.
[04:03:19] <hetii> so i need something like div selector where i can decide with one will be displayed.
[04:03:53] <xec_> hetii: this is why i had the bot tell you to make a demo - i'm not clear on what you mean. with a demo with the proper content and buttons it's easier to understand
[04:04:41] <xec_> hetii: it's easy to show and hide divs with .hide() and .show() so i'm guessing your problem is to target the right ones?
[04:06:41] <hetii> indeed the .hide() do what i need :) the rest works fine :>
[04:07:02] <ravenzz> isn't there a documentation for the reset event?
[04:07:10] <ravenzz> ?reset
[04:07:10] <bot-t> :reset: Selects all elements of type reset. http://api.jquery.com/reset-selector/
[04:09:07] <Eviltwin> I don't think there's a .reset()
[04:10:09] <ravenzz> that's silly
[04:10:14] <Eviltwin> I agree
[04:10:36] <Eviltwin> Maybe #jquery-dev can give a reason
[04:12:04] <ravenzz> yep I'll ask there
[04:12:39] <xec_> you could do .reset() on a native form dom element though
[04:13:00] <xec_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/form.reset
[04:14:11] <ravenzz> I need to handle the reset event when a select is resetted
[04:14:34] <ravenzz> now $select[0].form.addEventListener("reset", function () {})
[04:14:38] <ravenzz> should work
[04:14:40] <hetii> hmm
[04:14:48] <ravenzz> but I was wondering if there is a smarter way to do that
[04:17:39] <dblosevn> $select.closet('form').bind('reset', function () { }); maybe ?
[04:18:23] <xec_> closest* on*
[04:18:25] <xec_> :D
[04:18:38] <dblosevn> hey i didnt sleep last night lol
[04:18:58] * xec_ hands dblosevn a nice hot cup of fresh coffee
[04:19:02] <ravenzz> dblosevn sure
[04:19:15] <dblosevn> :-D
[04:19:17] <ravenzz> still silly anyway
[04:19:25] <xec_> why silly
[04:20:11] <ravenzz> because the select itself has the reset event
[04:20:26] <ravenzz> actually $select[0].addEventListener("reset", that.reset());
[04:20:47] <dblosevn> $select.on('reset', function() { });
[04:21:22] <ravenzz> dblosevn eh that's the problem, reset is not implemented in jquery
[04:21:44] <xec_> what
[04:22:06] <dblosevn> .on should let you bind any valid js event
[04:22:29] <xec_> dblosevn: so  $select[0].addEventListener("reset", that.reset()); works?
[04:22:47] <dblosevn> no clue but if that works .on should too
[04:22:51] <ravenzz> not it doesn't
[04:23:01] <ravenzz> $select[0].form.addEventListener does
[04:23:18] <xec_> sorry that last message was for ravenzz
[04:23:26] <dblosevn> I try never to do jqobj[index] as index might not exist and it throws a nasty error
[04:23:42] <xec_> ravenzz: so if you got it to work, what is the issue? :)
[04:23:54] <dblosevn> if your gonna do that id do .get(0) instead
[04:24:05] <FernandoBasso> I'm reading http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/data_sources/server_side.html. According to the php script, it should get some variables via $_GET, but it seems dataTables is not sending those variables. Any help with it?
[04:24:49] <ravenzz> dblosevn np, I have the HTMLSelectElement too
[04:25:29] <xec_> ravenzz: why don't you just do $('mySelectSelector').closest('form').on('reset', ...)
[04:25:33] <ravenzz> xec_ it would have been better with a $select.on("reset", foo))
[04:25:47] <xec_> ravenzz: but the reset is never fired on the select....
[04:25:55] <dblosevn> well, thats what i was thinking
[04:26:02] <dblosevn> reset is fired on the form not the element
[04:26:10] <ravenzz> xec_ eh ok, but if you console.dir a select
[04:26:16] <ravenzz> you can see the onreset event there
[04:26:18] <ravenzz> :?!
[04:27:00] <ravenzz> so it should have it
[04:27:07] <KristofferDarj> I'm binding with on like this: jQuery('#cointainer').on('click','.row a.add',function(e){   How do I access the a-element inside the function? e = the event. jQuery(this) = window ? I wanna do jQuery('a-tag').parents('.row').remove();
[04:27:22] <dblosevn> true form should fire reset on all elements
[04:27:27] <Cork> Krinkle|detached: $(this)
[04:27:34] <ravenzz> dblosevn exactly
[04:27:37] <xec_> ravenzz: i don't see it
[04:28:03] <Cork> Krinkle|detached: and you prov want .closest not parents
[04:28:15] <Cork> *prob
[04:29:20] <dblosevn> ^^ * KristofferDarj
[04:29:28] <xec_> ravenzz: this is where i'm testing btw http://jsfiddle.net/xRYmS/
[04:30:26] <Cork> lol thx dblosevn  :)
[04:30:46] <Cork> too many weird nicks in here :P
[04:31:07] <xec_> ravenzz: i can't find a proper doc describing reset, but i get the same result in chrome/ff/ie - only the form listeners work. less than useful: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla_event_reference/reset_%28event%29
[04:31:22] <aitiba> how can I fix this error: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://aitoribanez.com/jquerym/api.php?rquest=login&callback=?. Origin http://localhost is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[04:31:43] <aitiba> I look on google but the answer that I find, didnt fix me the problem
[04:31:52] <Firemonk> can anyone explain why this code doesnt work? I cant figure it out http://pastebin.com/hT9rHHjb
[04:31:52] <Cork> aitiba: is the server sending jsonp?
[04:32:15] <Cork> or rather are you requesting jsonp
[04:32:22] <ravenzz> xec yes I am aware of that. I mean, of course it works when you bind on the form
[04:32:32] <ravenzz> but look at this http://jsfiddle.net/DQy4k/
[04:32:47] <ravenzz> onreset is there
[04:33:04] <xec_> i don't see it... what browser?
[04:33:40] <ravenzz> chrome
[04:33:40] <xec_> in any case, there's really no point in arguing about what might have worked and what might not, when it's clear what the behaviour really is
[04:33:52] <KristofferDarj> Cork thanks. Didn't even know about closest
[04:34:03] <Cork> ravenzz: the reset event is for the form, form elements doesn't really have a reset state
[04:34:33] <Cork> uh, that came out wrong
[04:34:35] <ravenzz> so it isn't fired on all the form elements
[04:34:39] <ravenzz> ?
[04:34:40] <Cork> * form field elements doesn't even have
[04:34:43] <ravenzz> I don't think so..
[04:34:43] <Cork> no
[04:34:55] <ravenzz> ok nvm
[04:35:04] <Cork> reset is similar to .submit
[04:35:16] <Cork> it triggers on the form when the user asks to reset the form
[04:35:29] <hetii> xec_: You can see how it works at http://superkuznia.pl/ i have there some unknown issue with TypeError: p.easing[this.easing] is not a function
[04:35:33] <Cork> (by ex. an <input type="reset">)
[04:35:42] <xec_> hetii: are you using jquery ui?
[04:35:55] <hetii> i added it on heads
[04:36:11] <jarr0dsz> anyone have used html5 boilerplate + jquery mobile?
[04:36:21] <ravenzz> Cork yes but when you reset the form you change its elements value (reset)
[04:36:21] <jarr0dsz> i looked at jqeury touch but jquery mobile seems better
[04:36:29] <jarr0dsz> but not sure on the combination cannot find any decent info on it
[04:36:30] <ravenzz> uhm maybe onchange would work
[04:36:37] <jarr0dsz> would html5 boilerplate be uneeded when using jquery mobile?
[04:37:07] <Cork> Firemonk: when is it you want that to act?
[04:37:09] <xec_> hetii: the reason i ask is because jquery core only ships with 2 types of easing. for the rest you need jquery ui effects
[04:37:43] <Firemonk> Cork: after the images/page have loaded
[04:37:44] <Cork> ravenzz: yes, based on what the form stored on its elements
[04:38:24] <Cork> Firemonk: that will trigger once as soon as the original page has been parsed, and never again
[04:38:39] <Cork> Firemonk: never for any sub page (ajax) loads
[04:39:05] <hetii> so i suppose easing what is used somwhere in my code is not even in jquery-ui.min.js
[04:39:21] <hetii> how can i determine what is missing/./
[04:39:22] <hetii> ?
[04:39:28] <fonko> guys i have a question
[04:39:34] <Firemonk> it shouldnt be triggering more than once AFAIK, its just to adjust the position of an images caption to overlay its corresponding image based on how big the caption is
[04:39:54] <fonko> im not being able to pass a variable from a form, in ajax
[04:40:16] <fonko> one of the variables is going through but the other one is not reaching the .php
[04:40:17] <fonko> http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/SNKqk8n1Qm
[04:40:22] <Cork> Firemonk: and you're sure this is ok to do before the image is loadeD?
[04:40:24] <Cork> *loaded
[04:40:29] <fonko> here the form http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/hWk2SmJgak
[04:41:06] <Firemonk> no I wanted it after the image is loaded
[04:41:14] <grafi> which one goes through which one does not @ fonko
[04:41:46] <fonko> the one that is not going through is limit
[04:42:01] <rethus> is there a nice plugin to change an ordenary select-box to a nice div-styled one ?
[04:42:04] <Cork> fonko: you don't need .find("input, select, button, textarea, checkbox"), $form.serialize() should work just fine
[04:42:05] <fonko> i mean limite
[04:42:24] <fonko> Cork, ok. good to know
[04:43:15] <fonko> or mayby its going through but im doing something wroing from the php side
[04:43:34] <fonko> should i expect it like $_POST['limte']; right?
[04:43:46] <fonko> $limite = $_POST['limite'];
[04:45:06] <Cork> fonko: ah, sorry i missed what you used $inputes for
[04:46:19] <Cork> fonko: http://jsfiddle.net/rrzMP/1/ wfm
[04:46:20] <fonko> im trying to send two variables, one the username and the other the limits of tweets that im going to collect from the user
[04:46:28] <fonko> ok
[04:46:34] <Cork> and you're going get not $_POST
[04:46:58] <Cork> ... stupid debugger
[04:47:00] <Cork> scratch taht
[04:47:21] <Cork> (why the hell does it show me a get url when its post >_<' )
[04:47:34] <fonko> thats weird huh?
[04:47:43] <fonko> same thought i had
[04:47:58] <Cork> fonko: ayway it does what it should
[04:48:06] <Cork> when i read the debugger correctly :=
[04:48:38] <Cork> user=asd     limite=ghj is sent as a post to the server
[04:50:00] <fonko> so i have something wrong in my .php
[04:50:05] <Cork> yes
[04:50:06] <fonko> let me show you
[04:50:06] <fonko> http://bin.cakephp.org/saved/81374
[04:50:16] <fonko> http://bin.cakephp.org/saved/81375
[04:50:31] <fonko> 75 is the class
[04:50:32] <fonko> 74 is the .php
[04:50:40] <fonko> that invokes the class
[04:50:43] <Cork> fonko: try var_dump($_POST)
[04:51:00] <vinici> or try #php
[04:51:30] <Cork> gut it sounds like it might be caused by something earlier in your framework
[04:51:42] <fonko> k
[04:52:01] <vinici> fonko try ##php or #cakephp
[04:53:12] <fonko> Cork, but im not being able to se that var dump because im sending through ajax
[04:53:28] <fonko> im not using any framework
[04:54:04] <seutje> write it to a file
[04:54:25] <fonko> for this one
[04:54:25] <fonko> only used cake bin site because its nice haha
[04:54:49] <xec_> you could just inspect the http response

[04:56:30] <Cork> fonko: catch it and dump it to a file
[04:57:18] <fonko> is there any function to do it fast?
[05:00:04] <Cork> fonko: its off topic here to you need to read it your self or ask in ##php http://php.net/manual/en/function.ob-start.php

[05:03:56] <fonko> array(2) {

[05:03:56] <fonko>   string(2) "14"

[05:03:57] <fonko> post array its ok
[05:03:58] <fonko> dang
[05:04:36] <Cork> fonko: please don't dump rows in the channel
[05:05:17] <fonko> Cork, sorry
[05:05:56] <Cork> anyway so it's definitely a php problem
[05:07:08] <fonko> right, i will check
[05:09:08] <Firemonk> OK the code works when i replace ($(".flex-caption").height()*-1) + "px" with a flat value, which leads me to believe this part of the syntax is wrong
[05:09:19] <Firemonk> but i dont see it
[05:10:17] <Cork> Firemonk: you might be running $(".flex-caption") before it has the new dimention
[05:10:33] <Cork> try console.log'ing it
[05:11:00] <Firemonk> OK i'll have a look
[05:11:09] <Cork> suspect its 0 or something like that
[05:11:35] <Cork> Firemonk: my question earlier was; are you sure you want ready and not .load ?
[05:12:53] <Firemonk> well i guess my answer is I dont know, this is pretty much the first time ive used jquery for anything
[05:13:12] <Cork> Firemonk: it depends what you want to wait for
[05:13:26] <Cork> Firemonk: .ready triggers as early as its safe to work with the dom
[05:13:48] <Cork> Firemonk: .load triggers when the page and all images and a few other things has loaded
[05:14:02] <Cork> Firemonk: so if you have to wait for an image to render correctly you want .load
[05:15:01] <Firemonk> well the code itself doesnt interact directly with the images but the <p> underneath which is acting as the caption for the image
[05:15:16] <Firemonk> so its not really necessary to wait for the images i dont think
[05:15:47] <Cork> it depends on if you need to wait for the dimensions of the image
[05:18:24] <Firemonk> console.log($(".flex-caption").height()) returned 0
[05:18:58] <Cork> and console.log($(".flex-caption").length) ?
[05:19:28] <Firemonk> length is 5
[05:19:55] <Cork> you know $(".flex-caption").height() will only return the height of the first matched element right?
[05:19:58] <Cork> not a sum
[05:20:30] <Firemonk> oh
[05:20:47] <Cork> ?.height

[05:22:56] <Bartzy> Hi
[05:24:01] <Bartzy> When using insertAfter, or append, or whatever - for example $('<div>' + text_from_user + '</div>').insertAfter('#blah'), do I need to encode text_from_user for html entities?
[05:24:29] <Bartzy> Or jQuery does it for me, somehow? Even though it really can't know when I want it to be escaped and when I really want a DOM element, I guess..?
[05:24:52] <Cork> Bartzy: jquery doens't case
[05:24:58] <Cork> it just hands it to innerHTML
[05:25:16] <Cork> as long as the encoding is supported it should work just fine
[05:25:42] <Bartzy> Cork: So if for example text_from_user is from a comment the user just commented and posted, and it contains <script>, it will be evaluated as a script tag ?
[05:25:51] <Cork> and if your page is utf8 (which is should be) it should work just fine
[05:26:09] <Cork> Bartzy: yes, and no
[05:26:24] <Cork> jquery will snatch the script tag and execute it in document head
[05:26:26] <Bartzy> Cork: That is very ambivalent :)
[05:26:31] <Bartzy> Why do that ?
[05:26:42] <Cork> cause if the script tag is in the body
[05:26:44] <Bartzy> Cork: So to avoid that, I should use some kind of entity replacement, right ?
[05:26:49] <Cork> and you move it, it will evaluate again
[05:26:55] <Bartzy> ah
[05:26:57] <Cork> and thats most of the time not what you want
[05:27:11] <Cork> if you want to prevent the script execution use .test
[05:27:15] <Cork> *.text
[05:27:15] <Bartzy> Because jquery deletes and then injects again elements that are moved, to avoid lots of repaints ?
[05:27:34] <Bartzy> but I'm using insertAfter to insert a big bunch of HTML, part of that HTML is some text the user may write.
[05:27:45] <Cork> Bartzy: if you work with dom elements, yes, but not for repaints
[05:27:59] <Bartzy> Cork: So for ? Reflows ? :|
[05:28:12] <boulet101010_>  http://jsfiddle.net/bKPgc/ how to say to the function that the argument should be the element where the button is contained ? (don't want to use element.parent("li") in the function
[05:28:12] <Cork> to not lose event listeners for one
[05:28:18] <emx> how do i iterate over an object? i need the keys and the values.
[05:28:23] <Cork> to not have to parse the html again
[05:28:25] <Cork> and so on
[05:28:49] <Cork> ?jquery.each @ emx
[05:28:50] <bot-t> emx, jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[05:29:21] <Cork> boulet101010_: i already answered you a few hours ago
[05:30:03] <Bartzy> if you delete an element and then re-inject it , the events will still be attached ?
[05:30:22] <Bartzy> Cork: And also, I can't really use text.. so I should just replace < with &lt; and so on? Have some function to do that ?
[05:30:24] <Cork> if its kept as dom elements; yes
[05:30:51] <dblosevn> Bartzy: no if you delete an element its listeners are removed, if you move an element they are retained
[05:31:07] <Cork> Bartzy: just do $('<div/>').test(your-html).insertAfter('#target')
[05:31:18] <emx> Cork, i tried it with $( obj ).each(). what's the difference?
[05:31:25] <Cork> dblosevn: the liseters isn't removed if you keep a reference to the dom element
[05:31:51] <Cork> emx: $().each is for looping jquery wrapped dom elements
[05:31:58] <Cork> not generic objects
[05:32:00] <Cork> ?.each
[05:32:01] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:32:12] <emx> Cork, k, thanks
[05:33:06] <Cork> dblosevn: try var cache = $('selector'); cache.remove(); $('other-parent').html(cache);
[05:33:40] <dblosevn> Cork: Were saying the same thing just differently lol
[05:34:17] <Cork> dblosevn: check the code section in the meddle there
[05:34:26] <dblosevn> the word delete sounds final, its gone, removeing an element and keeping a reference to it so you can move it somewhere else is not deletting the element its moving it lol
[05:34:26] <Cork> dblosevn: thats where you'r statement doesn't work
[05:34:53] <xec_> Cork: your*
[05:34:54] <dblosevn> Cork: what statement? I didnt offer any code
[05:34:55] * xec_ hides
[05:35:09] * dblosevn cunfizzled
[05:35:19] <Cork> lets say it like this in stead then var cache = window.tmp_cache = $('selector'); cache.remove();
[05:35:38] <boulet101010_> Cork: sorry i haven't seen it i was out for lunch
[05:35:49] <Cork> dblosevn: then some where else in the code you do $('selector').html(window.tmp_cache)
[05:36:04] <Cork> the event listeners would still work
[05:36:28] <Cork> dblosevn: you said if you remove it its gone
[05:36:35] <dblosevn> Cork: I understand that, you havent technically deleted them though, you just removed them from the dom, they are still in memory
[05:36:49] <dblosevn> Cork: I said if you delete it its gone :-)
[05:37:07] <Cork> dblosevn: depends on what you mean by delete
[05:37:18] <dblosevn> still technically in the dom though you just moved the element to window
[05:37:30] <Cork> then thats not what i did
[05:37:41] <Cork> i just stored it in a javascript variable
[05:37:49] <Cork> its completely gone from the dom
[05:38:00] <Cork> later i readded it to the dom
[05:38:49] <Cork> dblosevn: what the browser cares about is if something points to the dom element
[05:39:01] <Cork> dblosevn: it doesn't have to be the document dom
[05:39:13] <miphe> having a real trouble with the load() function in 1.8.2 still. Can't seem to make it work in any way.
[05:39:29] <miphe> Is there a dependancy on anything else but core for load() ?
[05:39:29] <dblosevn> Totally understand and I said you were right I assumed he meant removing and recreating the element not removing storing a reference and restoring it
[05:40:00] <Cork> miphe: the event listener or the ajax function?
[05:40:16] <miphe> Cork: The ajax function
[05:40:34] <Cork> miphe: .load works just fine here
[05:40:52] <Cork> miphe: could you create an example of what fails for you? see ?p
[05:40:52] <bot-t> miphe, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:44:02] <miphe> Cork: http://fixee.org/paste/b1h8rql/
[05:44:27] <miphe> So this worked fine with 1.7.2, now that im updating I can't get it to work
[05:44:58] <miphe> Maybe the error is too obscure to see with the .min version of jq.
[05:45:38] <Cork> miphe: try it in jsfiddle or jsbin and see if you can reproduce it in a live env
[05:45:49] <miphe> ok
[05:46:13] <Cork> you can use another post to act as the contact url
[05:48:25] <Firemonk> OK i changed the code to $(window).load and changed the .height() to .css("height"), using console.log to monitor .css("height") before the actual code and for .css("margin-top") after the code, I knwo my code works but 9/10 height will return 0px
[05:48:58] <Firemonk> and on a rare occasion it will return a value which i find kinda odd
[05:49:01] <Cork> so it was racy, and is still racy
[05:49:06] <Cork> (just a bit less)
[05:49:35] <miphe> Cork: So I can target like this? .load("http://fiddle.jshell.net/xtPkq/show/#main") if I want?
[05:50:04] <Cork> /xtPkq/show/#main
[05:50:10] <Cork> no need for the full url
[05:50:34] <Cork> but yes
[05:50:37] <miphe> ok thanks
[05:51:09] <Misiur> Firemonk: could you pass the fiddle link, I didn't catch it
[05:52:19] <Siver> Hi, for some debug work I need to find out what element is clicked. Right now, there's a selector that is activating a plugin ... I need to find out what selector is triggering it
[05:52:33] <Firemonk> OK gimme a sec to put it in fiddle
[05:52:59] <Cork> Siver: you can put a breakpoint in the plugin code and check this.selector
[05:53:35] <Cork> Siver: hmm wait
[05:53:46] <miphe> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/tUaaj/1/
[05:53:49] <Cork> Siver: does the plugin bind the event listener or do you do that?
[05:53:56] <Siver> well, it's fancybox
[05:54:00] <miphe> Im not sure thats giving me the error.. im getting nothing
[05:54:09] <Siver> for some reason it's reloading itself when I click in any content inside the fancybox
[05:54:21] <Cork> miphe: http://jsfiddle.net/tUaaj/2/
[05:54:24] <Siver> but I have no idea why
[05:54:40] <Cork> miphe: you had the wrong library on the left
[05:54:41] <mazzachre> Is it somehow possible to switch on the element type of a jQuery object in a .each?
[05:54:48] <Siver> so I'd like to find out what is triggering the fancybox to reload itself
[05:54:59] <Cork> mazzachre: sure
[05:55:05] <Cork> this.nodeType
[05:55:39] <Cork> mazzachre: or this.nodeName if you prefer that
[05:56:38] <mazzachre> ok, thx...
[05:56:57] <Cork> Siver: that might be a bit tough, you could try bind a event listener on body and listen for all clicks on the document
[05:57:15] <Cork> Siver: but that only works if it's a link that causes it
[05:57:30] <miphe> Cork: Ok thanks. So I can not use this for other domains right.. just from jsfiddle (other posts)
[05:57:37] <Misiur> I thought that jQuery bubbles all events to document anyways
[05:57:50] <Cork> miphe: sure, it works on all pages, just not cross domain :)
[05:57:51] <Siver> Cork: that's in the lines I was looking for ... but I just don't know how to catch the selector out of that
[05:58:23] <Cork> Misiur: yes, but if fancybox catches it on an earlier element it won't get to the body if you're unlucky
[05:59:05] <Cork> Siver: ya, i totally get what you're trying to do, but its quite hard
[06:01:40] <Cork> Siver: i guess the best option is to try and bind event listeners to the different elements and see between what elements fancybox acts
[06:02:06] <Siver> Cork: I was actually doing that right now, couldn't think of any other options myself
[06:02:21] <Cork> well there is an array of all bound events on the page
[06:02:43] <Cork> but as you can't ask it for "all elements below element x" its kinda pointless in this case
[06:02:49] <Misiur> You can use chrome console profiler or add on element modification breakpoint
[06:03:09] <miphe> Cork: For instance, I can't get this to work: http://jsfiddle.net/tUaaj/7/
[06:03:13] <Cork> if you're lucky that might work, you can do similar things in the other browsers
[06:03:25] <Cork> but its most likely too noisy
[06:04:11] <Cork> miphe: ya, its cross domain (fiddle.jshell.net tries to fetch from p.miphe.com
[06:04:13] <Cork> )
[06:04:49] <Misiur> miphe: Click 'testing ajax requests' on the sidebar and use those links
[06:05:07] <Cork> Misiur: thats already been done
[06:05:19] <Misiur> Oh. Didn't read whole conversation
[06:05:42] <rethus> how can i invert this $("div:contains('John')")
[06:05:50] <rethus> means to ask.. if !contains
[06:06:02] <Cork>  $("div").not(":contains('John')")
[06:06:16] <miphe> Cork: I misread earlier - thought you said 'works on all, just cross domain' :)
[06:06:17] <rethus> cool, thanks. never seen those not() function
[06:06:19] <miphe> makes sense.
[06:06:29] <Cork> lol
[06:07:21] <miphe> Ok, so thats concluded. its not a problem with 1.8.2.
[06:07:26] <miphe> its somewhere on my site.
[06:07:32] <miphe> Thats bad news.
[06:07:39] <miphe> Or.. actually good news.
[06:08:00] <Cork> miphe: make a static copy of the problematic page, big enough to make it work
[06:08:31] <Cork> miphe: then reduce it until you can't touch anything without it doesn't work at all/stops being problematic
[06:08:36] <Cork> that should help quite a lot
[06:08:37] <rethus> Cork: can i even do this: $('.searchfield_relaunch').focus.not()
[06:08:47] <Cork> no
[06:08:53] <Cork> .not is a selector
[06:08:58] <Cork> .focus is an event handler
[06:09:30] <Cork> rethus: you can do in in the focus event though
[06:09:33] <Cork> $(this).not()
[06:09:41] <boulet101010_> http://jsfiddle.net/ZsSw2/
[06:10:18] <rethus> k, thanks
[06:10:19] <boulet101010_> can somebody check my fiddle? it's about event declaration.
[06:11:06] <Cork> boulet101010_: uh.. you create an li element, then append it to an ul you create with $()
[06:11:15] <Cork> and then you throw the ul away?
[06:12:11] <Cork> bubbles10101: you need to either keep a reference to the ul, or append it to the dom
[06:12:20] <boulet101010_> no bubbles10101
[06:12:30] <boulet101010_> but, i don't create an ul in the $()
[06:12:40] <Cork> sure
[06:12:45] <Cork> but you don't keep any reference to it
[06:12:51] <Cork> so it dies right away
[06:13:19] <boulet101010_> ok but i don't see where it matters
[06:13:34] <Cork> line 11 does absolutely nothing
[06:13:35] <boulet101010_> because i want just to apply to function events to the li i just created
[06:14:00] <Cork> and when the $(function() {} ends li does too
[06:14:11] <Cork> cause you never append any of them to the dom
[06:14:55] <boulet101010_> O_o
[06:15:13] <boulet101010_> i don't see what you mean, the li element is well created and the events are correctly declared nop?
[06:15:16] <Cork> you first create an li element, (unattached), then you append a button to it
[06:15:20] <Misiur> $(document).on('click','ul li button',function(){});
[06:15:30] <Cork> then you create an ul and attaches the li to is
[06:15:36] <Cork> then the ul dies cause nothign references it
[06:15:45] <Cork> followed by the li dying cause nothing references it
[06:16:01] <Cork> boulet101010_: sure, but none of them are ever appended to the dom
[06:16:19] <Cork> they're just unattached "dangling" elements
[06:16:19] <boulet101010_> of course it is, look at the result
[06:16:48] <Cork> the results?
[06:16:53] <boulet101010_> yes
[06:16:54] <boulet101010_> in the fiddle
[06:17:08] <boulet101010_> (i created another one fyi)
[06:17:17] <boulet101010_> (that i think is more clear)
[06:17:44] <Cork> ah, you create a global variable that points to the button >_<''
[06:17:51] <Cork> so it keeps it alive
[06:18:20] <Cork> boulet101010_: cause button isn't declared this is all that says alive  button = $("<button>",{html:"click"})
[06:18:28] <Cork> the rest dies
[06:18:44] <boulet101010_> dumb myself...
[06:18:59] <Cork> but how that at all ends up in the dom is besideme
[06:19:10] <Cork> beside me
[06:19:34] <Cork> man that code is impossible to read O_o'
[06:20:00] <boulet101010_> ok, i'm going to do something better. sorry for being awkward
[06:20:01] <Misiur> boulet101010_: http://jsfiddle.net/ZsSw2/2/
[06:20:09] <Misiur> but still code is messy
[06:20:23] <Cork> boulet101010_: anyway you want to use a delegated event listener
[06:20:31] <Cork> like what Misiur is showing you there
[06:21:09] <boulet101010_> true
[06:21:12] <boulet101010_> this is it Misiur
[06:21:20] <Misiur> http://jsfiddle.net/ZsSw2/3/ without the weird thingy
[06:21:40] <Misiur> It's updated version of .live (live > bind > on)
[06:21:43] <boulet101010_> i was misunderstanding when you said it for first, you should have explained me that $(document).on creates a delegated event
[06:23:08] <Misiur> It's like $('#element').on(function(){  }) - not delegated, $(document).on('event', '#element', function(){  }) - delegated
[06:23:37] <Misiur> err  $('#element').on('event', function(){  })
[06:24:01] <boulet101010_> ok thanks
[06:25:06] <boulet101010_> but the goal was to declare the click event on a children of the li.
[06:25:35] <boulet101010_> that's why "events" looked strange to you?
[06:27:46] <Misiur> Well, I know it's testcase so it might look weird. But it's same story $(document).on('click', 'ul li', function() { $(this).find('button').html('Yay'); })
[06:33:55] <rethus> is it not focus() if i enter a searchfeld with a mouse
[06:34:08] <rethus> should i better use click?
[06:34:22] <GranMal> I have this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/pPYQ5/  I'm having an issue getting the Text and data-action attribute to change on a second click  Must be something with .bind  Not sure why it's not making it through the second if block  Any ideas?
[06:34:43] <Cork> rethus: it should be both, and no you should primary use focus
[06:35:32] <Misiur> GranMal: Where's your js?
[06:35:57] <Cork> and the html tag should only contain the body part of your code :)
[06:36:06] <Cork> s/tag/section/
[06:36:58] <GranMal> Misiur & Cork: Sorry, didn't click update  it's there now
[06:37:10] <GranMal> html fixed as well
[06:37:21] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pPYQ5/1/
[06:37:21] <GranMal> http://jsfiddle.net/pPYQ5/1/
[06:37:26] <Cork> :D
[06:37:38] <kaista> does anyone know why the first time I console.log(); a jquery object in chrome it comes out wrapped in []'s (as if it's an array) but after my calendar regenerates the html element comes out in the log without the []'s?
[06:37:54] <Cork> GranMal: don't mix attr and .data
[06:38:04] <Guest62525> i want use spinner or processing , till browser comes to responding . is it possible?
[06:38:11] <Cork> GranMal: pick one or the other for the data- attributes
[06:38:29] <GranMal> Cork: ok  Gimme a sec and I'll try it out
[06:38:34] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/pPYQ5/2/
[06:38:42] <Misiur> Guest62525: Yup, gif with spinner, then hide in on window load
[06:39:13] <GranMal> Cork: Interesting  Wasn't aware of the cash  thanks!
[06:40:08] <GranMal> Cork: I need the data-action attribute to change on click as well  Any idea why it's not working?
[06:40:24] <Cork> GranMal: don't use .data at all
[06:40:36] <boulet101010_> Misiur: i checked what you advised to me but there's still a problem : strangely the events re-triggers the more i click on the buttons.
[06:40:40] <boulet101010_> http://jsfiddle.net/ZsSw2/5/
[06:40:50] <GranMal> Cork: ok, is it just buggy? For future reference?
[06:41:04] <Cork> GranMal: it works as intended
[06:41:23] <Cork> GranMal: the attribute is imported if its not in jquery's store
[06:41:31] <Guest62525> Misiur , I am calling one fun() its takes  5 to 10 secs to retun a value, that time browser is not responding, so how window load ll work
[06:41:32] <Cork> GranMal: if its in the store the attribute isn't touched
[06:41:41] <Cork> granden: .data never changes the attribute
[06:41:52] <boulet101010_> oops : http://jsfiddle.net/ZsSw2/6/
[06:41:55] <GranMal> Cork: I see  Ok, thanks for the quick crash course lesson
[06:43:41] <Misiur> boulet101010_: I had this issue too, because in events function there was $('button').click(..something which added additional events
[06:44:27] <boulet101010_> yes, maybe delegated isn't the right way...
[06:44:36] <Misiur> Guest62525: Does it use an ajax call? If yes - use the callback function
[06:44:50] <Cork> boulet101010_: just make the button event delegated too
[06:45:05] <Cork> and you won't have to do the extra click listener at all
[06:45:23] <Siver> Anyone know how to unbind the selector that activates fancybox after it has run once?
[06:45:31] <kaista> OK, first time an event fires I attached a tooltip (qtip) works fine, second time it fails it returns Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'qtip' , I try to wrap that object in a $(element) but it still won't let me get to any of the jQuery methods etc.. any ideas?
[06:45:52] <Cork> Siver: you don't unbind a selector, you unbind an event listener
[06:45:53] <black_warlock> any pro here today ?
[06:45:59] <Cork> black_warlock: no
[06:46:07] <black_warlock> Cork : fook
[06:46:13] <Siver> Cork: sorry for incorrect wording, that's what I meant
[06:46:47] <Cork> Siver: you could try $(elm).off()
[06:46:53] <mazzachre> Which is the better way of getting all editable fields in fieldsets in my form? $('#myForm fieldset *').filter(':input') or $('fieldset', '#myForm').find(':input') ?
[06:46:57] <Cork> where elm is the element that triggers fancy box
[06:47:02] <Misiur> boulet101010_: Show your current code - I'm almost certain that problem lies in events function
[06:47:19] <Misiur> what about textfield?
[06:47:25] <boulet101010_> just updated the fiddle
[06:47:31] <boulet101010_> it is /6
[06:47:42] <Siver> Cork: does not work, but it actually has to happen after trigger() as it needs to open automatically
[06:47:44] <Cork> Misiur: :input matches all form fields
[06:47:55] <black_warlock>  I need somebody help me solving thi damed problem ! How can i add a listner on the buttons to manage the fact UL is open or closed indipendetly from click action ? http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/fyZuH/5/
[06:47:56] <Misiur> Cork: Didn't know that
[06:48:49] <Misiur> boulet101010_: I don't know what you are trying to achieve. Currently on each li click you are adding event to button
[06:48:51] <mazzachre> Which is faster? The select 'x *'.filter or the 'x'.find() ? Or are they equal?
[06:49:13] <black_warlock> its driving me crazy
[06:49:32] <Cork> mazzachre: bench it
[06:49:44] <Cork> black_warlock: independent from click action?
[06:50:21] <black_warlock> yes
[06:50:37] <Cork> black_warlock: what is it you're trying to do that doesn't work?
[06:50:44] <black_warlock> must check if ul is open or closed and change the text inside button with + or -
[06:51:00] <Cork> ah
[06:51:08] <Misiur> :visible ?
[06:51:31] <Cork> why don't you just use .toggle on the element where you toggle it now?
[06:51:49] <black_warlock> because it will be inside the click function
[06:51:56] <Cork> black_warlock: or even better use a class on the parent li element instead
[06:52:06] <Misiur> That's best option - class on parent
[06:52:08] <black_warlock> let me explain this
[06:52:08] <Cork> have two spans in the button with both states
[06:52:11] <Cork> and toggle it with css
[06:52:31] <bil`> Is there anyway to force a user to use the jQuery UI date picker rather than typing in a text input
[06:52:43] <black_warlock> in the real script there is a function which highlight the pushed link
[06:52:50] <Cork> bil`: make the input field readonly
[06:52:57] <bil`> Cork: how?
[06:53:06] <Cork> <input type="text" readonly>
[06:53:14] <black_warlock> so when a link is opened the link will be highlighted opening all parents UL
[06:53:32] <bil`> ah.. never knew input had that atrib
[06:53:34] <Misiur> bil`: Just remember to check value on backend (those danged malicious users)
[06:54:12] <bil`> yea this is for a sake of speed for a demo pitch :)
[06:54:14] <Cork> but ya, could just validate the results, and let the use do what ever they want
[06:55:21] <mazzachre> Cork: How to benchmark something like that?

[06:56:02] <adavia> hey guys.. im wondering what do i need to change here in order to have the submit buttons in the same line whenever i switch between tabs http://jsfiddle.net/Kf9zL/
[06:56:43] <boulet101010_> Misiur, Cork : i figured it out with $().on(click..., seems not to bubble/propagate
[06:57:00] <Cork> adavia: in the same line?, you mean that the tab should have a scroll bar or what?
[06:58:02] <eu__neo> i am dealing with a browser issue (IE9) for disabled input text elements which support highlighting
[06:58:05] <adavia> Cork:  i mean the submit buttons should be align whenever u switch between tabs.. since i have 2 forms one in each tab
[06:58:18] <eu__neo> could i use jquery to log all the events which occur on the input text element
[06:58:25] <eu__neo> could i use jquery to log all the events which occur on the input text element?
[06:58:38] <eu__neo> in order to easier identify a workaround
[06:58:57] <adavia> Cork:  its like the position of the buttons change when u switch from one tab to another
[06:59:29] <Cork> adavia: change or that it doesn't change?
[06:59:36] <eu__neo> sample code is available here : http://jsfiddle.net/FQpRh/
[07:00:00] <Cork> adavia: if you want it to stay in the same position make .row-fluid a fixed height
[07:00:05] <Cork> adavia: same for both
[07:00:08] <adavia> Cork:  change cuz of the size of the content
[07:00:19] <Cork> it does that already
[07:01:00] <adavia> Cork: right.. i dont want that.. and i have change the height but it didnt work =/
[07:02:45] <Cork> adavia: ah, the button is inside that element :s
[07:03:08] <black_warlock> hell
[07:03:12] <black_warlock> my function works
[07:03:14] <black_warlock> O.O
[07:03:47] <adavia> Cork:  yes.. i tried changing the tabbable div height
[07:04:35] <kaista> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'qtip' any ideas?
[07:05:08] <Cork> adavia: http://jsfiddle.net/Kf9zL/2/
[07:05:49] <adavia> Cork:  what have u changed?
[07:06:10] <adavia> the container height?
[07:09:25] <Cork> adavia: yes
[07:09:39] <Cork> adavia: a grouping element for the sections you want the same height
[07:11:06] <mazzachre> Oh wow... 'x *'.filter is by far the faster way of getting specific children of something...
[07:12:45] <adavia> Cork:  thanks man

[07:23:39] <EdwardIII> hey
[07:24:07] <EdwardIII> is there something i can hook into to say "do this for every stage of the slideDown?" i want to move another element underneath the one that's sliding down
[07:24:16] <Chris_CC> Hi guys, have a quick question ... i want to have a "popup" registration form when people click to register, how do i go about this .. I have done a quick google but think i'm using the wrong terminology to find what i want
[07:24:36] <miphe> Cork: problem finally located. I was setting an additional datatype in ajaxsetup that didn't agree with 1.8.2

[07:52:31] <vimreaper> I have a currenty pop-up window for selecting products from a menu, but the pop-up window is displayed on the top of the page, so when your on the bottom of a page and click the button that triggers it, you have to scroll up to see the window.  Anyone know of a good resource that will allow me to code the pop-up menu to show up in the middle of your screen no matter where your at in the scroll?

[07:54:36] <GPR> I'm trying to use addClass on an a tag in a nested div but it doesnt seem to be applying it. Wondering if someone could just look over my code and see what obvious error I've missed please? http://jsfiddle.net/yaun2/
[07:55:33] <GPR> I've debugged the rest of the script and it all works except the addClass lines.. :/ guessing I've got something mixed up
[07:55:53] <rethus> someone knows this: http://www.bulgaria-web-developers.com/projects/javascript/selectbox/
[07:56:14] <emx> how do i scroll to a specific element?
[07:56:15] <rethus> i initiate it, and the select-field is hidden... but no div's are created
[07:56:19] <rethus> any idea why
[07:58:58] <GPR> ??
[07:59:01] <shoky> GPR: you have a space between .col-X and .row-X  in your selector, that would match .row-X which are descendants of .col-X
[07:59:58] <shoky> (remove the space)
[08:00:21] <GPR> Ahhh sweet it works!
[08:00:25] <GPR> Thank you
[08:03:48] <shoky> vimreaper: all you need for that is some CSS. simplest way is to use position:fixed on your popup
[08:13:17] <asker> hey guys, is it possible to simulate a click on an element?
[08:13:36] <shoky> $('#elem').click()
[08:13:51] <asker> kk ty :D
[08:31:37] <vimreaper> shoky: That would work great except the menu is long and I can't scroll to the bottom of it and when I put a scroll bar on the menu it isn;t working correclty
[08:50:29] <miphe> Fiddling with $.ajax is breaking a lot of stuff for me, but I cant figure out why
[08:50:42] <miphe> I'd assume that its OK doing this: http://jsfiddle.net/Pcat6/
[08:51:40] <miphe> For some reason, all my ajax calls are broken due to this.
[08:52:16] <miphe> http://jsfiddle.net/Pcat6/1/
[08:52:22] <miphe> Thats with the correct lib as well.
[08:54:28] <pifantastic> miphe: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ have you tried using the beforeSend event instead?
[08:55:16] <timing> miphe: what's up with the rawAjax?
[08:55:44] <pifantastic> miphe: either way, you need to `return this._rawAjax()`
[08:55:51] <pifantastic> if you want it to behave the same
[08:55:54] <timing> you override all urls with a language field?
[08:55:56] <miphe> Well, pifantastic - I suppose that's what I should be doing. Seems right.
[08:55:58] <pifantastic> since $.ajax retunes a promise
[08:56:06] <miphe> Exactly timing
[08:56:14] <pifantastic> miphe: actually, I don't know that you can change the URL in beforeSend
[08:57:27] <miphe> pifantastic: the URL is a setting right? Why wouldn't I be able to tamper a bit with it?
[08:58:47] <pifantastic> miphe: more info here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1597666/modify-url-of-an-xmlhttprequest-object
[09:01:26] <brettster> hey yall
[09:01:38] <miphe> pifantastic: hm, calling xhr.open they suggest
[09:01:39] <brettster> have a question
[09:02:32] <miphe> pifantastic: Feels better to make it a requirement to have proper URLs in the markup from the start, without modifying them at all.
[09:02:36] <brettster> how can I scroll an images position (top or bottom) as the browser window size gets longer
[09:02:54] <relipse>  are there any programmers or contract workers that can test out my new website www.cworklog.com - a time logging and invoice system for contract programmers and such, (sign up for a new account then log in and start the timer)
[09:02:56] <brettster> basically i have an image that is set to 100% so it takes up 100% of the window size
[09:03:03] <brettster> and it's in a  container with a height of 200
[09:03:32] <brettster> if the browser size gets too big - i need to move the top positioning to a negative number

[09:13:35] <klj613> hello - how much of a performance hit is it when i use $(..) on already-initialized jquery objecT?
[09:17:51] <avinashrbhat> hi,all is the $.widget.bridge changed (from version 1.8.16 to 1.9.1) ?. i'm seeing the code `var fullName = object.prototype.widgetFullName;` extra for the starters, this code causes my plugin to stop working when i ported to 1.9.1. I didn't see anything in the changelog. or is it a bug???.
[09:18:28] <avinashrbhat> hope someone will tell me
[09:25:58] <avinashrbhat> @klj613, guess there is a performance overhead. see:http://jsperf.com/jquery-double-invocation,
[09:25:58] <avinashrbhat> i've created a performance test of this, for me the double invocation causes 40% extra overhead. look and seefor yourself
[09:27:53] <klj613> avinashrbhat, thanks
[09:35:30] <avinashrbhat> klj613 happy, to help :-)

[10:01:05] <jhsto_> Hi folks, I would need to add a onsubmit event to a form with jQuery, any idea how I can actually add it to the selected form?
[10:01:52] <Alpha64> why not just add onclick to the button?
[10:01:54] <xec_> $("form").submit(function(){...}) ?
[10:02:20] <xec_> when you say "add event" i assume you mean "add event listener"
[10:02:37] <xec_> (as opposed to trigger)
[10:03:15] <ircmaxell> I'm having an issue with .text() returning an empty string even though the element does have text nodes inside of it
[10:03:18] <jhsto_> xec_ I have no idea why I did not think about that
[10:03:30] <jhsto_> Let me try if it will work.
[10:03:41] <xec_> ?demo @ ircmaxell
[10:03:42] <bot-t> ircmaxell, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[10:04:07] <ircmaxell> nevermind, thanks anyway
[10:04:15] <jrajav> Is there a simple way to change a CSS rule?
[10:04:22] <jrajav> For the document, not for a particular element
[10:04:46] <jrajav> The rule selector is like: div.tright:hover .jrajav-image-overlay, div.tleft:hover .jrajav-image-overlay
[10:05:07] <Cronoh> what do you mean change a css rule
[10:05:11] <xec_> jrajav: not really. a common approach is to have all your different styles in css with class selectors, and then just add/remove the classes you want
[10:05:18] <NackNick> someone wanna take a quick look at this and tell me wtf is wrong with it, im doing a focusout function and trying to do a alert for whatever length of chars are in the input field and its not triggering on the focusout. http://jsbin.com/ehumiv/1/edit
[10:05:54] <xec_> Cronoh: i assume he means modifying the rules from external stylesheets
[10:06:26] <jhsto_> xec_, I think it worked, thanks :)
[10:06:45] <JFranks> I want my Autocomplete results on two lines like this : http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data  ... but putting a <br> in the label in the data just renders "<br>" ?
[10:08:30] <xec_> JFranks: check out the source of that demo
[10:08:40] <NackNick> nvm i got it
[10:08:44] <NackNick> forgot to add val
[10:09:12] <xec_> JFranks: the server is sending back a label and a desc, then the _renderItem method is patching it together with a <br>
[10:09:16] <JFranks> xec_: making a fiddle just to explain where I am not getting in particular
[10:09:40] <xec_> well, not a server in this case, but you get my point
[10:13:29] <JFranks> ARGH.. nope too dumb to show where I'm dumb. My use case isn't matching any of the examples. I am unable to see where I got this code from.. Grrr..
[10:18:27] <Slartbartfast> Hello, I'm running the following selector: $("tr[role=row]") on the chrome javascript console, but instead of returning me a list with the rows, the selector returns a c.fn.c.init object, how to access the rows inside this object ?
[10:19:07] <Slartbartfast> Even if I run the selector as $("tr") i get the c.fn.c.init object
[10:19:13] <avinashrbhat> Slartbartfast can u provide some code for it?
[10:19:48] <Slartbartfast> sure, but what code do you need exactly ?
[10:19:50] <avinashrbhat> you can use jsfiddle.net/jsbin.com for it
[10:19:59] <Slartbartfast> the table code ?
[10:21:01] <avinashrbhat> i'm just telling you that if you can recreate that piece of code/error on the server, i can give a look
[10:21:48] <Slartbartfast> avinashrbhat, that will be a problem, since the table is the jqgrid plugin
[10:22:35] <Slartbartfast> and loaded dynamically
[10:23:27] <MistuhKurtz> simplify and isolate the problem then
[10:23:28] <avinashrbhat> oh!, but you can use a echo request for that purpose, rite?
[10:23:34] <MistuhKurtz> Don't load the data dynamically
[10:24:48] <avinashrbhat> hi,all this is a continuation of my previous chat, there really seems to be having a bug in the $.widget.bridge (jquery ui 1.9.1). please look at the ticket http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8775
[10:26:11] <JFranks> xec_: Yeah the autocomplete examples, from what I can tell vary wildly between implementing the internal function and using some jQuery to tackle the task.. ?  My use of it is getting the data via "$.getJSON()" that does a couple splits to break the data down .. I get lost right there..
[10:27:11] <xec_> JFranks: i thought ajax calls were built into the autocomplete widget
[10:28:24] <Slartbartfast> avinashrbhat, I believe this is happening because the jqgrid plugin, since with a "normal" table that doesnt happen
[10:28:57] <xec_> JFranks: anyway, i gotta go - good luckk
[10:29:01] <xec_> -k
[10:30:03] <Slartbartfast> avinashrbhat, sum that to the old version of jquery I'm using.... wich I cant upgrade.....
[10:30:10] <tuv> where are the jqueryui requirements for jquery version listed? do they have to match exactly?
[10:30:22] <Slartbartfast> avinashrbhat, thanks anyway
[10:30:38] <Slartbartfast> MistuhKurtz, thanks for you too
[10:30:58] <MistuhKurtz> why can't you upgrade jquery Slartbartfast ?
[10:31:50] <JFranks> Here's my attempt to get my local implementation of http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp into a fiddle.. I have ZERO background with jQuery and AJAX .. When I've done AJAX it's been old school JS and PHP ;(
[10:31:56] <JFranks> http://jsfiddle.net/DqskF/
[10:32:32] <DukeDrake> hi
[10:32:49] <JFranks> The "var $ajaxfind.." is an example of what the remote data will look like
[10:33:03] <DukeDrake> how can I put a tr-element after the third tr-element of a table?
[10:33:48] <JFranks> Now all this works.. BUT I am just snapping blocks together so I'm too dumb to know how to get some <br> elements in there
[10:33:53] <avinashrbhat> Slartbartfast my guess i that you are using an old version of the jqgrid.
[10:34:13] <DukeDrake> (append() appends the code at the end of the third tr ... not after)
[10:34:52] <tw2113> DukeDrake, wouldn't adding new tr elements mess up the count order for the rest of them?
[10:35:30] <DukeDrake> tw2113: ??
[10:36:17] <tw2113> you want to inject a new <tr> tag after every 3rd <tr> tag right?
[10:37:06] <tw2113> i'm wondering if that'd mess up the count/index values and get varied results after that first one
[10:37:12] <tw2113> untested, just thinking out loud
[10:38:18] <DukeDrake> tw2113: don't know what you're talking about.
[10:38:26] <DukeDrake> just found after(). Works.
[10:41:45] <shoky> JFranks: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DqskF/2/
[10:41:51] <JFranks> I suppose I have to read: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/   .. If I understand that more I may understand how it's making <ul> <li> elements like this demo http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data  shows (but adds <br> elements to make the entries multi-line?)
[10:42:13] <shoky> JFranks: disregard the change i made to the 'source' function, i just put some dummy data there instead of the ajax request
[10:42:38] <shoky> JFranks: so as long as your JSON response looks like that dummy data i put, it'll work
[10:43:24] <JFranks> shoky: Okay I spent a lot of time poking my PHP to make the data look the way it wanted it before but I'm getting good at formatting.. ;)
[10:43:55] <shoky> JFranks: you just need to return a JSON array with {label: ..., desc: ...} items
[10:44:32] <JFranks> shoky: You see the example?
[10:44:52] <JFranks> shoky: the var $ajaxfind
[10:44:54] <shoky> JFranks: i copied the code from that example.. you see my example?
[10:45:01] <shoky> what
[10:45:15] <shoky> oh right
[10:45:33] <JFranks> That's the format the PHP returns
[10:45:44] <JFranks> (after much diddling about .. ;)
[10:46:47] <shoky> well that's no good
[10:46:53] <shoky> mm
[10:47:36] <shoky> you could either get it right on the PHP, or make your own success handler for the getJSON which takes that JSON and makes it a proper array to send to the 'response' callback
[10:47:49] <JFranks> What needs to change in the pHP?
[10:47:54] <JFranks> Damnit I hate this KB
[10:48:14] <shoky> it needs to look like:   [{label: '...', desc: '...'}, {label: '...', desc: '...'},...]
[10:48:33] <shoky> an array, not an object
[10:50:59] <JFranks> Okay done
[10:51:38] <shoky> ok
[10:51:58] <JFranks> I could edit the example data.. ?
[10:52:26] <shoky> i donno?  it doesn't work?
[10:52:38] <EHLOVader> evening all!
[10:52:55] <JFranks> Well your example points to a manual definition of data not a datasource
[10:53:08] <shoky> that was just to get the fiddle working..
[10:53:15] <EHLOVader> I know there are quite a few libraries out there, for parallax like scrolling, but are there any like scrolldeck, jquery scroll path, curtain, etc etc, that actually have a gui builder?
[10:53:33] <shoky> JFranks: the important part in my example is at the bottom, the part i copied from that #custom-data example
[10:53:44] <shoky> JFranks: .data("autocomplete")._renderItem = function(ul, item) { ...
[10:53:51] <shoky> what xec was also talking about.
[10:54:07] <EHLOVader> for my marketing team to take and work with, something tied into any photoshop application, (shudders at the thought, but I want them to be in control of this)
[10:54:23] <JFranks> Yeah .. but I have .. argh.. lemme just see if it just works.. I don't think I can but end C against socket Y
[10:54:50] <shoky> wat
[10:54:50] <b-ot> It means that you can devote a your page, to those who do have JS turned on. I.e. only those with JS turned-on to call the function.
[10:55:58] <EHLOVader> thinking of using one of these for a newsletter, letting people scroll through internal company news, but since it is internal, always changing, I don't want to maintain it...
[10:56:24] <EHLOVader> thanks..
[10:57:06] <josefig> is there a method to create a object to use into a .post() getting the info from a encodestring (ej. pass=1&method=16&user=20) ?
[10:57:20] <krawchyk> can someone explain this behavior to me? http://jsfiddle.net/XdA2z/
[10:57:35] <krawchyk> not sure why jquery counts a boolean true as false
[10:57:45] <JFranks> Okay the data change didn't break the stuff I got working.. Now presumably the data I'm sending to the $.getJSON() function.. which calls extractLast() and split() has to know to put "<br>" into the "<a>" items in the <li> items in the <ul> ?
[10:58:07] <GreenPowerRanger> Focusing only on the topnav div here. I have a set of links each with an id and a class. I'm trying to use keyboard navigate through their selected states based off the id value so when you reach the item it takes the value of id and adds selected to the end of the string then uses this for the value in addClass. http://jsfiddle.net/dAhxQ/1/
[10:58:23] <shoky> JFranks: the <br> is only added when rendering... in that _renderItem function
[10:58:46] <shoky> JFranks: if you changed your PHP to output the array, then you don't need to touch the way you did $.getJSON
[10:58:59] <shoky> you just need to add that ._renderItem thing..
[10:59:11] <JFranks> Hmmm
[10:59:13] <GreenPowerRanger> However I cant figure out the right notation for it to concatanate the id string with selected on the end into the addClass
[10:59:25] <JFranks> Looking at how I'd get my code to look at that renderitem thing?
[10:59:58] <monokrome> Hey. Is there a reason why sending requests with type "json" still uses the "*/*" accept header? I would have expected something like "application/json" and it isn't possible to overwrite it in the headers option.
[11:00:02] <shoky> JFranks: your code doesnt need to do anything, jquery UI calls that function
[11:01:02] <JFranks> Okay .. this doesn't make any sense programatticaly .. but hey .. copy pasta.. run
[11:01:51] <xec> jQuery, the copy more, write less library
[11:01:52] <shoky> JFranks: you only need to call the 'response' callback, passing it the result array with the {label:..,desc:..} items. then jquery UI takes that and for each item in the array, it calls _renderItem
[11:01:59] <JFranks> Unexpected Token ".data("autocomplete")...
[11:02:20] <shoky> JFranks: by default, it uses its own internal _renderItem.. but this is apparently the way to supply your own method of rendering
[11:02:42] <shoky> it makes sense.. the API could be nicer though
[11:03:19] <xec> JFranks: maybe you got some weird character in there when you were copying the pasta?
[11:03:22] <shoky> JFranks: you probably didn't remove the semi-colon  before .data ?
[11:03:48] <shoky> the .data(...)  is run on that same element you called .autocomplete(..) on
[11:03:58] <xec> actually, listen to shoky. shoky knows best.
[11:04:06] <shoky> it's just a chain..     $(..).autocomplete({..}).data('autocomplete')._renderItem
[11:05:23] <krawchyk> why are no elements visible in this snippet? http://jsfiddle.net/XdA2z/1/
[11:05:57] <GreenPowerRanger> ??
[11:06:12] <JFranks> Ahhh so the .data("auto...) is part of the .autocomplete 'function'? .. I really don't get the why of it all but at least it's working in a somewhat consistent fashion ..
[11:07:54] <systemfault> monokrome: From what I've seen so far... jQuery never sends JSON as JSON, it does it as form encoded data
[11:09:30] <GreenPowerRanger> Anyone know how I can place an element id into the value for .addClass() ??
[11:10:14] <GreenPowerRanger> ie for id="menu" i'd have addClass('menu')
[11:10:41] <GreenPowerRanger> I tried attr('id') but it said Uncaught ReferenceError: attr is not defined
[11:11:04] <systemfault> GreenPowerRanger: Then it's not a jQuery wrapped DOM node.
[11:11:18] <systemfault> GreenPowerRanger: Is it a "this" inside a event handler or something like that?
[11:11:39] <GreenPowerRanger> No..
[11:11:43] <GreenPowerRanger> http://jsfiddle.net/dAhxQ/1/
[11:12:09] <GreenPowerRanger> I've tried 2 different ways in the js code there
[11:12:30] <systemfault> $('a') will select all <a>s on the page, you understand that?
[11:12:51] <GreenPowerRanger> Yes
[11:13:33] <GreenPowerRanger> basically there is a selected state and a default state, every time I press a key I want it to remove the selected state from anything on the page and apply the selected state to the specific item I've moved to
[11:13:45] <GreenPowerRanger> Which is why that line is so broard in scope
[11:14:02] <GreenPowerRanger> broad*
[11:14:13] <systemfault>  $('a').removeClass(attr('id')); What do you want to do exactly?
[11:14:17] <catcher> GreenPowerRanger, that sounds like a job for classes rather than IDs..
[11:14:20] <systemfault> What is it supposed to do?
[11:14:49] <catcher> or maybe data values, depending
[11:14:56] <systemfault> Do you have a global function called attr?
[11:14:59] <GreenPowerRanger> it's a ui with seperate objects which I want to navigate using the arrow keys
[11:15:19] <GreenPowerRanger> so say I have menu & showme
[11:15:31] <Saaether> when i look at your jsfiddle page all i see is a gray screen o.O
[11:15:49] <GreenPowerRanger> thats because I havent hosted the images in the css
[11:16:14] <GreenPowerRanger> So menu & show me.
[11:16:36] <systemfault> GreenPowerRanger: What is the attr() function in the following line:  $('a').removeClass(attr('id'));
[11:17:13] <GreenPowerRanger> I'm tryin to fidgure out how I put .attr() into addClass
[11:17:34] <GreenPowerRanger> like I've done for window.location at the bottom of the script with the href value
[11:17:55] <GreenPowerRanger> but I want the id value instead of href...
[11:18:04] <GreenPowerRanger> I'm just very confused :(
[11:18:29] <systemfault> GreenPowerRanger: jQuery has a attr function but it can only be called on a jQuery object
[11:19:39] <GreenPowerRanger> and I'm not using a jquery object?
[11:20:47] <systemfault> $('a') returns a jQuery object so it can be called on it.
[11:21:06] <systemfault> just attr('id') is not
[11:21:34] <systemfault> $('a').attr('id') would return the id of the first match <a>
[11:21:40] <systemfault> matched
[11:23:45] <GreenPowerRanger> So can I use the $('.items .col-' + curcol + '.row-' + currow) line to specify a specific id which I want to grab?
[11:23:59] <systemfault> Sure
[11:24:13] <GreenPowerRanger> I'll give it a go, ty
[11:25:49] <zfly9> Hey guys I have http://tolaw.highrankdev.com/faqs/ and there is a list of questions at the top of the page that use anchor tags and the same list of questions in the left side. In FIREFOX, when you click a link on the left hand side then click on of the top links, it jacks up the page. It kind of makes the top of your screen the new top of the page and cuts off the rest.. Any suggestions?
[11:32:39] <jacobroufa> hey room
[11:34:37] <jacobroufa> so maybe this is a dumb question or seven... but ive got an ajax call that populates a template with a json object. after the data comes in, in one stream, id like to apply tabs to it.... that all works great until i hit the timer of my setTimeout and the fresh content populates
[11:34:59] <jacobroufa> so how would i keep the tabs when the fresh content comes in??
[11:35:39] <catcher> jacobroufa, they'd have to be created as descendants of content that doesn't get clobbered.
[11:35:55] <GreenPowerRanger> systemfault: I tried console.log($('.items .row-' + currow + '.col-' + curcol).attr('id')); but it says undefined :/.. However I know the object it's looking at has an id.. I tried switching the id to title aswell incase .attr just doesnt play well with id for some reason but it returns the same thing..
[11:36:45] <vinici> GreenPowerRanger maybe your variables are undefined :) like the currow and curcol
[11:36:48] <jacobroufa> catcher: but the template only gets populated/created when my data comes in, so i cant init the tabs until the first $.get()
[11:37:38] <catcher> jacobroufa, you need to init empty tabs above the part of the template that gets the content, and then fill the tabs when the data comes in.
[11:38:10] <GreenPowerRanger> The line before it is console.log(curcol + ',' + currow); and it returns the correct values
[11:38:22] <GreenPowerRanger> That's how I know it's looking at the right objects...
[11:39:09] <zfly9> anyone?
[11:39:33] <catcher> GreenPowerRanger, that just means your statement isn't returning objects..
[11:41:38] <jacobroufa> catcher: i guess thats the part im having issues with then... the tabs are created in an each() over the json object that im fetching so i cant exactly populate them beforehand
[11:41:40] <catcher> jacobroufa, your other option is to have all of the tab code included in the template
[11:41:49] <jacobroufa> catcher: thats what im doing currently
[11:41:52] <defaultro_> hey guys, I need to call an url that returns an xml. What function do I need?
[11:42:46] <defaultro_> then I need to convert the xml response as a json object too
[11:43:00] <Back2Basics> subprocess question:  p = subprocess.Popen(wb.open(form_url),stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
[11:43:00] <Back2Basics>  I get an error when I do this that bool isn't iterable.  How do I wait for the browser to close?
[11:43:05] <Back2Basics> oops
[11:43:10] <Back2Basics> wrong channel
[11:45:02] <defaultro_> i found a good link, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/ but I need to pull it first from the website
[11:48:36] <JFranks> defaultro_: Interesting question in terms of jQuery .. I know how to do it in JS but not the jQuery equivalent
[11:49:03] <catcher> jacobroufa, you should be able to redraw the tabs on a new load, unless only some of your tab init happens outside of the content load.
[11:49:30] <JFranks> defaultro_: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/  ?
[11:49:35] <ale152> hi!
[11:49:49] <defaultro_> thanks
[11:50:08] <defaultro_> JFranks, I wrote it in JS but I am having issues with the xml
[11:50:08] <catcher> defaultro, even a regular get() may do the trick, followed by xml2json()
[11:50:41] <ale152> if I'm working on a callback of $selector.any_callback(function() { this callback adds new elements to $selector}), how do I update $selector in the same callback?
[11:50:50] <shoky> if you're receiving xml, don't use getJSON
[11:50:57] <defaultro_> I 'm using this to download the xml, xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
[11:51:02] <shoky> use .get or .ajax
[11:51:07] <defaultro_> I get the response as string
[11:51:15] <defaultro_> ok
[11:51:17] <jacobroufa> catcher: sorry for the dumb question. i had a tag screwed up in my template, which fubared my IDs and my tabs in turn.
[11:51:27] <catcher> jacobroufa, np, glad it's sorted
[11:51:30] <jacobroufa> apparently im just an idiot when it comes to syntax lol
[11:51:39] <catcher> it happens!
[11:51:40] <defaultro_> found this, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8498098/parse-xml-with-jquery-ajax-request
[11:52:00] <jacobroufa> yeah definitely, thanks. though eventually i do need to figure out some better way to do this...
[11:52:01] <JFranks> defaultro_: Ahhh looks like this is what I've been skipping: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:52:16] <defaultro_> yup
[11:52:23] <defaultro_> that's what I am planning to use
[11:52:53] <Woet> why would you use xml with javascript?
[11:53:22] <shoky> Woet: because a server that you're fetching data from serves only xml, for example
[11:53:28] <Woet> then get a better server
[11:53:34] <JFranks> Woet: Typically you would do that when you have zero source control
[11:53:35] <Saaether> o.O
[11:53:40] <shoky> who says it's your server..
[11:53:57] <tw2113> given that the X in ajax stands for xml technically...
[11:54:00] <Woet> ajax to a third-party domain?
[11:54:19] <jacobroufa> Woet: sometimes you have no other choice. though, ive taken an xml source and turned it into usable json to manipulate further in js...
[11:54:22] <tw2113> not exactly unfounded
[11:54:37] <Woet> i'm not saying it's impossible but usually it's easier to output (or convert) it into json
[11:54:48] <shoky> that's what he's trying to do..
[11:54:58] <shoky> in javascript, so what.
[11:55:08] <tw2113> then tell everyone everywhere to convert to json instead of xml Woet
[11:55:12] <JFranks> Woet: I have monkeys around me twice as dumb as me. XML would be a treat most days.. Heck getting .csv in proper format is like pulling nails.. people don't get data
[11:55:17] <tw2113> or at least add the option
[11:55:21] <Woet> hm, i was going by the code on that stackoverflow
[11:55:30] <Woet> tw2113: I just did, didn't I? :)
[11:55:41] <Woet> i tell that to every API I have to work with that doesn't have JSON
[11:55:48] <tw2113> good
[11:55:59] <tw2113> until they comply, sometimes you may have to deal with xml
[11:56:09] <tw2113> or go somewhere else for data
[11:56:11] <Woet> of course, i was not saying it's an impossible scenario
[11:56:24] <shoky> ?cc
[11:56:25] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[11:56:38] <Woet> oh bot-t is alive again
[11:56:42] <Woet> awesome
[11:57:49] <shoky> for the moment
[11:59:19] <defaultro_> is there something wrong with my ajax success call?  Here is the code -> success: function(response) { console.log(response); }
[12:00:21] <shoky> nothing wrong with that snippet
[12:08:33] <jacobroufa> damn. still not working
[12:08:35] <pentarex> hey guys I have one question. How I can make get request with type XML from subsmax.com it is giving me same origin policy.... Ive cant do it with jsonp because it says the mime type is not json
[12:10:37] <defaultro_> shoky, yeah. It worked but the response was in object Document
[12:10:44] <defaultro_> not in xml format
[12:11:13] <systemfault> pentarex: You can use CORS if you don't need to target older browsers
[12:11:32] <pentarex> systemfault: I am developing chrome extension
[12:11:39] <pentarex> so it will work only in chrome
[12:12:07] <systemfault> I never written a chrome extension, sorry
[12:12:48] <pentarex> systemfault: it is nothing special to develope... but CORS is working with chrome right?
[12:17:32] <defaultro_> how come, this response is being returned as Document? http://pastebin.com/9kcM21kJ
[12:18:03] <systemfault> pentarex: Sure.. but CORS = Send headers on the server-side
[12:18:29] <pentarex> systemfault: ahhh so I need server side ? :(
[12:18:36] <jacobroufa> yeesh. catcher, you still around? i dont know whats going on, but my tabs dont get reinit'd on each ajax call for some reason.
[12:18:37] <pentarex> defaultro_: content-type?
[12:18:48] <jacobroufa> even though all pertinent info is contained in the template im using
[12:19:00] <defaultro_> it's a real xml file
[12:19:02] <catcher> jacobroufa, any js errors?
[12:19:05] <defaultro_> i can see it in firebug
[12:19:12] <jacobroufa> catcher: nope
[12:19:32] <pentarex> defaultro_:  ok but I think you need to specify the content type
[12:19:41] <defaultro_> oh
[12:19:49] <defaultro_> let me do some research on how to do that
[12:19:53] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/rrs.html is the page that renders, http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/rrs.js is the js that controls it
[12:19:59] <jacobroufa> catcher: ^^
[12:21:18] <pentarex> defaultro_: http://pastebin.com/UzWHpDa6
[12:21:20] <pentarex> try it
[12:21:28] <defaultro_> cool
[12:21:45] <pentarex> though I am not sure application/xml or text/xml
[12:21:49] <pentarex> try it both way
[12:23:33] <defaultro_> didn't help
[12:23:56] <defaultro_> it is appears as document
[12:24:10] <defaultro_> i would want to also use xmltojson
[12:27:02] <pentarex> defaultro_: it is library you have to downloade it xml2json(xmlResponse);
[12:27:13] <pentarex> is it there some kind of error ?
[12:27:21] <defaultro_> no error
[12:27:59] <catcher> jacobroufa, quick glance looks like your stylesheet isn't being loaded on refresh.
[12:28:24] <pentarex> defaultro_: are you using chrome ?
[12:29:02] <defaultro_> firefox
[12:29:32] <pentarex> so the type of the response is document?
[12:30:36] <catcher> jacobroufa, or the html coming in isn't using the css.
[12:31:31] <catcher> Also, 2 different versions of jquery are being included.
[12:32:11] <jacobroufa> catcher: dont quite understand whats going on with the css
[12:32:53] <jacobroufa> the jquery thing though is because this is a test page for where it will really be loaded, and that page includes several versions of jquery (screwy, i know), hence my wrapper IIFE in my js file
[12:33:49] <catcher> jacobroufa, do you have tabbing working on a base case?
[12:34:03] <catcher> bbs
[12:34:26] <jacobroufa> catcher: yeah it works on page load; just not when my setTimeout refreshes the data
[12:37:52] <jacobroufa> catcher: what stylesheet isnt being loaded? im not including jquery-ui.css here...
[12:38:30] <Uabbie> I'm trying to make a javascript object that handles some socket.io logic. I want to extend from this object and make the extended objects into jquery plugins. This basically works, but I keep fighting with javascript's this. I made the objects into self-calling functions, but now the self-called function is not extended. I'm slowly going mad here.. This is my code: http://dpaste.org/NymzH/
[12:59:35] <fission6> how do i select a certain table from a jquery object i made $("bunchof html").('table') is that how
[13:02:26] <fission6> oh find
[13:06:41] <catcher> jacobroufa, your content that's loaded in doesn't apply the classes to the unordered list - ui-tabs-nav ui-helper-reset ui-helper-clearfix ui-widget-header ui-corner-all
[13:07:05] <catcher> possibly amongst other similar issues
[13:08:30] <jacobroufa> hrm
[13:09:08] <jacobroufa> catcher: i wonder why the main div's classes stick but not the ul and other elements that make up the tabs...
[13:10:52] <GPR> I still cant get this .attr() to work :/
[13:12:19] <GPR> http://jsfiddle.net/QHrPk/
[13:12:45] <GPR> It works in an earlier context of the same site http://wehavethemegapixels.com/BlinkBoxTV/
[13:13:26] <GPR> But I'm using as window.location = $('.items .row-' + currow + '.col-' + curcol).attr('href'); there
[13:13:46] <Aero`> Hi huys ! Would anyone have time for a quick question ?
[13:14:13] <TelFiRE> Hey all. Anyone know of a solid scrollbar replacement plugin which will be fairly easily modified to have no actual scroll "bar" just the arrows, and have those arrows hide if you are at the top/bottom respectively?
[13:15:22] <Aero`> I'm developping a PHP news system with mySQL and I would like to show on my backend only 10 news, and then have some kind of pagination to show the 10 next or 10 previous. Would anyone know how to proceed using jQuery ?
[13:16:52] <catcher> Aero`, I'd do that server-size instead almost every time.
[13:17:24] <Aero`> and then use ajax.load() to make it refresh-less ?
[13:17:52] <catcher> Aero`, yes, it they must be refresh-less
[13:17:57] <catcher> if*
[13:19:05] <fission6> how wuld i remove all classes from a parent element and all childrent
[13:19:44] <Aero`> thanks for the advice :)

[13:57:08] <jim_m> I have a jquery / ajax question.  where is the data in this library?  I'm not able to parse it;  http://www.beunix.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze-promotext/js/theblaze-promotext.js
[13:57:24] <jim_m> it's supposed to be coming from here http://www.beunix.com/wp-content/_js/promotext.js
[14:03:13] <fission6> does the hover event work on links?
[14:04:13] <josefig> If I make a post to a certain url and that url makes a redirect, how can I catch the new location from that redirect?
[14:04:41] <fission6> look at the responseText?
[14:06:10] <jim_m> fission6, I update it to alert data.title and got undefined;  http://www.beunix.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze-promotext/js/theblaze-promotext.js
[14:06:10] <josefig> fission6: I checked and I don't find any Location header
[14:06:23] <josefig> you meant, data response, right?
[14:22:04] <jonathancutrell> Hey everyone - I know this is a stretch, but has anyone ever used the Geolocation API to detect when a user leaves a particular location?
[14:22:15] <jonathancutrell> I'm assuming this is something only a native application could do.
[14:25:41] <avinashrbhat> jonathancurtell i guess it could be done even in browser. well, atleast by spec. http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html#geolocation_interface how much the bowser handles it is to be found out.
[14:35:17] <FrameFever> I want to get know, if a <img> is visible to the user or not?

[14:38:36] <Aero`> Hi guys ! Got some trouble on a little script. I'm developping a PHP news system, and I got a page which shows 10 news at a time. I'd like to add some jQuery pagination to this... My table is ajax loaded, and the id of the first table entry is passed as a parameter... I have two buttons and I'd like to have this kind of behavour : on click "next" button, ajax.load(..., id= current id + 10).
[14:38:41] <Aero`> Anyone would have an idea ?
[14:43:05] <razzi> Aero, sounds like an issue requiring multiple lines of reply. Those issues are usually ignored.
[14:43:10] <saml> how can I submit a form using .ajax?  shouldn't enctype be multitype/form-data ?
[14:43:36] <chord> http://jsfiddle.net/NVa65/2/    how do i my blue div to center in the red background
[14:43:36] <josefig> Hello, when I make a post action with $.ajax() and the response is a 302 Moved, how can I catch the Location header address. I tried in the jqXHR object but it has an empty string according to firebug. I can give you the url http://promoswap-dev.enterfactory.com/ci/opera
[14:44:53] <razzi> chord, center vertical or horizontal?
[14:47:16] <chord> razzi: how do i do that
[14:52:21] <chord> razzi: you must answer me!
[14:53:03] <tw2113> chord, he asked you a question
[14:54:01] <chord> tw2113: you know the answer too?
[14:54:14] <tw2113> i managed to get it horizontally centered
[14:54:18] <tw2113> vertically will be more difficult
[14:54:32] <chord> why is this problematic even with css3
[14:54:44] <tw2113> because they haven't determined a great way to handle it?
[14:55:01] <tw2113> horizontally, change it to display block, give it a width, and margin: 0 auto;
[14:55:54] <chord> but what if you want it  shrink wrapped to fit its content and then give it a border
[14:57:42] <jim_m> what's the best way to insert a new div before a div class="blah" ?
[14:58:36] <tw2113> ?before @ jim_m

[15:05:31] <TelFiRE> Anyone know a good scrollbar replacement that works on jQ 1.5? Found a fantastic one but only works on 1.6 :(
[15:07:40] <chord> tw2113: css expert tell me you have a solution to my probelm
[15:07:51] <tw2113> who said i was an expert?
[15:08:16] <tw2113> i already told you how to do it horizontally :P
[15:08:29] <tw2113> vertically has always been a challenge and i tend to just do a high top padding/margin
[15:09:04] <coldhead> i read on twitter that that guy parachuting from space last month proved that vertical centering couldn't be done
[15:10:22] <chord> wtf why is vertical centering so hard, did they not think about this when making css3
[15:10:51] <tw2113> i think it's been an issue since long before css3 was a twinkle in an eye
[15:17:06] <xboi209> is it possible i can write data in json format in a .html page?
[15:18:54] <shoky> you can write data in any format in any .* page
[15:19:29] <xboi209> sooo
[15:19:49] <shoky> sooo, ask the real question
[15:19:56] <xboi209> am i able to use variables inside the json data?
[15:20:06] <shoky> meaning?
[15:20:14] <shoky> json doesn't have variables..
[15:20:27] <xboi209> i know that but like
[15:20:29] <shoky> it's just data, not code
[15:20:40] <xboi209> ok lemme ask another question
[15:20:50] <xboi209> can jquery write json data?
[15:21:00] <shoky> huh?
[15:21:08] <xboi209> srry im new to this
[15:21:19] <shoky> then ask the actual question, not the question you think is behind it
[15:21:44] <Caelum> could someone point me to a form validation example?
[15:21:50] <xboi209> nvm forget about it
[15:30:13] <fission6> how would i remove all instances of "|" from text inside all <span class="whatever>fdsjfkF|ds</span>
[15:30:42] <xboi209> shoky: I have some json data that was stringified, am i able to access it from another domain?
[15:31:05] <fission6> no
[15:31:12] <fission6> not unless you implement CORS

[15:36:17] <josefig> somebody has information about jquery crossdomain to get the responses from  a GET and POST call via $.ajax() ??
[15:37:40] <jim_m> any reason why I would be getting the error:  TypeError: $ is not a function
[15:39:11] <KarateKip3> jim_m: yeah, i got that error last week
[15:39:23] <jim_m> apparently I should be using jQuery
[15:39:27] <jim_m> instead of $
[15:39:43] <jim_m> that's a Wordpress thing
[15:39:45] <KarateKip3> jim_m: in my case it was because of a conflict with other libraries
[15:39:51] <jim_m> oh ok
[15:39:58] <KarateKip3> MooTools
[15:40:04] <fission6> coldhead: looks good, how would i recplace this character, $('span').text(function (i, text) {

[15:42:58] <someprimetime> you can pass a callback into html?
[15:43:01] <someprimetime> html()
[15:43:01] <Caelum> so I'm doing: var elem = $('#form select[name=elem]').value(); but that's telling me it has no method named value
[15:43:21] <tw2113> try val()
[15:43:25] <someprimetime> xboi209 ^^

[15:50:33] <kristofers> I'm trying to hide a form once it has been submitted
[15:50:34] <dJquery> dang its quiet
[15:50:39] <kristofers> Anyone suggest which way to go ?
[15:50:57] <dJquery> err doesnt the page reload once the page has been submited
[15:51:21] <kristofers> Yes, but the form is being processed on the same page
[15:51:28] <Caelum> so chrome is telling me my form element has no method named val(), but when I go to the js console it works fine
[15:51:55] <dJquery> it would be better to test server side if the submit was success full then server side add a class to the form to hide it
[15:52:10] <dJquery> or better yet just not output the form from the server side
[15:52:30] <dJquery> unless of course your doing some kind of ajax submit
[15:52:57] <kristofers> let me throw it on jsfiddle real quick
[15:53:12] <dJquery> kristofers: k
[15:53:22] <dJquery> val is not valid for a form
[15:53:37] <dJquery> Caelum: ^^^
[15:53:50] <Caelum> dJquery: I'm doing $('#form select[name=elem]').val(), it works fine in js console
[15:53:53] <pentarex> hey guys Ive want to get text/xml with ajax from another domain but chrome throws error Same origin policy is there any bypass for this except server side (Im developing chrome extension)
[15:54:05] <Caelum> dJquery: but when I run my function, from the page, it throws that error
[15:54:23] <dJquery> well yes that css selector for an item in the form should be valid
[15:54:43] <dJquery> I am having lots of trouble with chrome rendering items lately
[15:54:52] <Caelum> dJquery: so why does my function fail
[15:55:17] <dJquery> put up an example at jsbin.com maybe
[15:56:30] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/yUpAB/1/
[15:56:58] <kristofers> What i am trying to do, is once the form has been submitted it becomes hidden, and the Message Sent appears in it's place
[15:57:02] <dJquery> kristofers: that is still doing a submit to the server
[15:57:40] <ezrafree> hello
[15:58:14] <ezrafree> has anyone ever heard of this issue, when creating a dialog with jquery-ui, a full viewport's worth of whitespace is created below the page
[15:58:25] <kristofers> What are my options then ?
[15:58:31] <ezrafree> in case it matters, the dialog is being set to fixed position
[15:58:38] <dJquery> kristofers: pass the event object to the form submission
[15:58:52] <dJquery> then do event.preventDefault();
[15:59:18] <dJquery> ?event.preventDefault@kristofers
[15:59:18] <bot-t> kristofers, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[16:01:51] <jcp_> is there a way to output the font being used on an element?
[16:02:01] <dJquery> hmm it is still not validating the phone etc
[16:02:03] <jcp_> or like the font family property for an element
[16:03:23] <dJquery> kristofers: have you thought about using the form validation plugin rather than rolling your own? see  ? validation

[16:08:48] <jrockjiggz> Hi, i'm using a function outside of the scope of $, but I am passing into it a jQuery object as $(this).   inside this function, i cannot use any jquery functions unless I wrap the EL with $(), but i'm not able todo $($this) //$this === $(this)
[16:09:01] <kristofers> djquery: i checked it out ealier but then i though just for 1 field i didn't really care but i will try it now,
[16:09:47] <kristofers> But when you tell me to add pass the event object do you mean to pass the hide event on submission ?
[16:09:54] <dJquery> kristofers:  if there is one field there will always wind up being more lol
[16:10:39] <kristofers> No it's just one phone field i need to send to another site
[16:10:46] <kristofers> everything works, except what i am trying to do for the look of it
[16:11:01] <kristofers> meaning hiding on submit and displaying a message
[16:11:18] <dJquery> http://jsfiddle.net/yUpAB/3/
[16:11:37] <dJquery> even just returning the false in the phone check its still not working
[16:12:10] <jrockjiggz> nm, i was able todo just that.
[16:13:53] <kristofers> Somehow a return false got added in the validateform
[16:14:10] <kristofers> or did you add it ?
[16:15:10] <dJquery> I added that as testing
[16:16:39] <kristofers> the prevent default is causing the form not to validate
[16:16:59] <kristofers> nevermind i removed the event in the function ..
[16:17:01] <dJquery> k you had mootools selected on the fiddle no wonder it wasnt working
[16:17:18] <kristofers> -.-
[16:18:13] <dJquery> kristofers: http://jsfiddle.net/yUpAB/4/
[16:20:19] <dJquery> kristofers: I imagine that somewhere you are going to be calling the submitted_form
[16:20:30] <dJquery> currently it never gets called on the form
[16:20:37] <kristofers> i have a function for that
[16:21:01] <kristofers> that submitted_form was just some testing
[16:21:04] <dJquery> kristofers: also did you say that you were going to be submitting to a different server
[16:21:07] <dJquery> ?
[16:21:12] <kristofers> i'm using curl to send a request to another site
[16:21:42] <dJquery> are you going to be doing an ajax submit to the server?
[16:21:53] <dJquery> or to your server?
[16:22:18] <kristofers> i'm just taking the phone number from the form and submitting it in the curl request

[16:23:12] <dJquery> but this form posts to your server then the server posts to the other one right?
[16:23:18] <kristofers> yeah
[16:23:23] <dJquery> cool
[16:23:29] <josefig> dJquery, is there a way to make a post call and If that call returns a 302 get the new location and try to redirect the browser? http://promoswap-dev.enterfactory.com/ci/opera << my draft
[16:23:49] <dJquery> when your server process the form just dont spit the form back out in the html that it is rendering
[16:25:15] <kristofers> Was taht for me dJ >
[16:25:21] <dJquery> yes
[16:25:37] <dJquery> there doesnt need to be any jquery involved in this
[16:25:46] <dblosevn> hmm... lol
[16:26:21] <kristofers> http://pastebin.com/V18JTqf6
[16:26:32] <dblosevn> Hey, im not thinkin right, right now, what is the jquery method to animate an object that I can use to animate multple objects at once?
[16:27:28] <dJquery> dblosevn:  its a comma
[16:27:37] <dblosevn> ...
[16:27:54] <jrockjiggz> dblosevn: animate() ?
[16:27:54] <jrockjiggz> lol

[16:28:14] <jrockjiggz> $('#el1, #el2').animate()
[16:28:19] <dJquery> then its a ; followed by the next item
[16:28:52] <dJquery> $('#el1').animate(); $('#el2').animate();
[16:28:52] <dblosevn> i want to make one shink the width to 0 and the other add 240 to the width
[16:29:08] <jrockjiggz> hey, i've got a click event binded to a <tr>... but i also have a checkbox within that.. if i click the checkbox, the event is fires :d
[16:29:13] <dblosevn> 0 sidebar content +240
[16:29:19] <dJquery> dblosevn: the way animate works they will move at the same time
[16:29:58] <dblosevn> oh i thought animate was blocking i guess
[16:30:10] <jrockjiggz> oh, .not(':checkbox') works fine

[17:21:55] <methos_> hi, can someone help me getting "tabs" working in jqueryui?? .... I used css scoping to download jqueryui. Accordion works just fine with scoping. But when I try to add tabs to web page, it does not work. When I inspected generated HTML element, I see that a couple of attributes do not get added (such as "role")
[17:22:59] <methos_> jqueryui version that I had downloaded with css scoping is "1.8.24"
[17:51:56] <bonhoeffer> i'm so confused, why do i need to click three times to get the popup?
[17:51:56] <bonhoeffer> http://serene-ocean-6019.herokuapp.com/
[17:53:57] <coldhead> probably something to do with the implicit returns Crok was moaning about yesterday
[17:54:25] <bonhoeffer> i'm just trying to get the twitter bootstrap popup to work with fullcalendar . . . :(
[17:56:47] <jedimind> bonhoeffer, why not give this guy a shot
[17:56:47] <jedimind> http://www.dangrossman.info/2012/08/20/a-date-range-picker-for-twitter-bootstrap/
[17:57:02] <bonhoeffer> will do
[17:57:04] <jedimind> i know it doesnt answer your question directly, but thats probably the sexiest / best datepicker / range picker for bootstrap
[17:58:10] <bonhoeffer> yeah
[17:58:14] <bonhoeffer> cool to see
[18:08:50] <xboi209> i have something funky going on here
[18:09:15] <xboi209> i put some jquery code in console.log() and it still runs
[18:09:20] <xboi209> is this normal?
[18:10:58] <xboi209> anyone?
[18:12:11] <coldhead> yes, it is very normal
[18:12:52] <xboi209> omg
[18:13:43] <adamo> what did you put there?
[18:14:17] <xboi209> was just changing the src of an image
[18:16:45] <Forrestr> Hi, i'm having trouble with my ajax post, it's returning nothing with my code http://pastebin.com/LFMyzA07 am I missing something?
[18:21:18] <DataLess> Forrestr, are you certain your event is firing correctly? ie $("#dpp_button").click(performAjaxSubmission);
[18:21:37] <adamo> yeah
[18:21:41] <DataLess> I'd throw an alert in that method
[18:21:42] <coldhead> yeah!
[18:21:58] <DataLess> before you worry about the ajax
[18:22:09] <Forrestr> Yea I have an alert on complete
[18:22:13] <Forrestr> it's firing
[18:22:29] <Hopsy> is it three o clock already
[18:23:02] <DataLess> so your success handler is firing...
[18:23:09] <DataLess> but nothing is hitting your php script?
[18:23:17] <Forrestr> file.php is print($_POST); the response is an empty array
[18:23:27] <Forrestr> print_r
[18:23:33] <Hopsy> I am looking for a slider, HELP!
[18:24:40] <Hopsy> something similar to this: http://2.s3.envato.com/files/36576885/thumb.jpg
[18:24:41] <DataLess> $(this) has a different stack frame when called within AJAX
[18:24:59] <DataLess> so...you need to either hard code that or lookup javascript closures
[18:25:03] <Hopsy> with one side to the right
[18:25:05] <jedimind> Hopsy, that image is nothing...
[18:25:10] <jedimind> also there are 230-58230958209385029385 jquery sliders out there
[18:25:11] <jedimind> pick one
[18:25:23] <Forrestr> Ty
[18:25:26] <Hopsy> is nothing?
[18:25:28] <DataLess> np
[18:25:53] <DataLess> it took me a while to wrap my head around closures, but it's a good fundamental concept core to JS
[18:26:16] <Hopsy> jedimind: paste me a link
[18:26:21] <jedimind> google.com
[18:26:24] <jedimind> fucking lazy people
[18:26:28] <DataLess> simple approach is just make those $(this).attr be some literal string, like 'foo' 'bar'
[18:26:40] <Hopsy> I am searching for now 3 hours long
[18:26:46] <coldhead> Hopsy: http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/carousel.htm
[18:26:50] <jedimind> then you suck at life, and should give up
[18:26:58] <jedimind> if you cant find a jquery slider in 3 hours
[18:27:02] <coldhead> that's pretty harsh jedimind !
[18:27:05] <jedimind> you need to stop using the internet
[18:27:11] <jedimind> im sorry, its true
[18:27:14] <DataLess> try AOL
[18:27:19] <coldhead> sounds like somebody has support burnout!
[18:27:26] <jedimind> lol
[18:27:32] <jedimind> at least its not "sounds like someone has a case of the mondays"
[18:27:59] <Hopsy> coldhead: already saw that, thats not exactly what I am looking for :(
[18:28:07] <coldhead> SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE HAS A CASE OF THE MONDAYS
[18:28:13] <Forrestr> Thnks I appreciate that. My knowlege of js is close to nil, I was able to pull this together while browsing different stackoverflow topics and the jquery docs, starting to get a sense of it.
[18:28:14] <jedimind> rofl
[18:28:27] <coldhead> Hopsy: are you sure exactly what you are looking for exists?
[18:28:35] <DataLess> Forrestr, i had to learn closures early on...
[18:28:43] <jedimind> are any of us really sure that anything really exists?
[18:28:46] <Hopsy> coldhead: http://www.eyecon.ro/spacegallery/
[18:29:00] <DataLess> otherwise, you'll keep hitting these scenarious especially when dealing with async nature of JS
[18:29:11] <Hopsy> but this one goes to above :')
[18:29:34] <coldhead> Hopsy: i would try adapting this one
[18:29:37] <coldhead> it's ALMOST what you want
[18:29:52] <coldhead> you just need to change the position for the background elements
[18:30:22] <Hopsy> untill you see their source code
[18:30:54] <coldhead> hahahah
[18:31:24] <coldhead> aw it's not that bad
[18:31:39] <coldhead> you probably could have written this yourself from scratch in 3 hours, Hopsy
[18:32:01] <Hopsy> thats true
[18:32:14] <Hopsy> and I already tried that too :(
[18:32:55] <Hopsy> and IE maked it a mess
[18:33:05] <Hopsy> -it *
[18:33:30] <coldhead> i am sorry for your loss, Hopsy
[18:33:43] <coldhead> if it's any comfort i am trying to fix some iframe mess a cow orker did
[18:33:49] <coldhead> but it keeps making me vomit
[18:35:13] <jedimind> a cow worker
[18:35:17] <jedimind> man i hate those guys
[18:35:23] <bonhoeffer> how would i add a popup to every anchor $('a')?
[18:36:10] <aaas> i'd like to make a jquery input form with back and forward buttons, does any one know of any examples out there?
[18:38:01] <Hopsy> this makes me sad
[18:38:10] <Hopsy> I am going to bed
[18:38:11] <Hopsy> byee :(
[18:38:16] <coldhead> bye Hopsy
[18:38:17] <coldhead> bye forever
[18:38:46] <Hopsy> why forever?
[18:43:08] <fission6> anyone have a rec to convert you tube links to embeded videos?
[18:48:05] <tw2113> copy the embed code
[18:49:21] <tw2113> var video = "" //the url, imagine it's there
[18:50:04] <tw2113> $('#div').html('<iframe src="'+video+'"></iframe>');
[18:50:19] <tw2113> add attributes as needed
[18:51:21] <jedimind> fission6, just .split the url, get the ID, and then there's a url you can hit to just view the video file directly based on id
[19:09:27] <hye> I have this JSON:  {"Subtotal" :  "7.9900", "Total" :  "11.68912500", "Tax" :  "0.69912500"}    then when I get that JSON from the server like this:  $.each(msg, function (key, val) {console.log(val);});   it just shows the whole JSON instead of looping through
[19:09:29] <hye> what am I doing wrong?
[19:11:59] <tw2113> works for me http://jsbin.com/aluqug/1/edit
[19:12:32] <hye> tw2113 i dont get the alerts on that sample you provided
[19:12:42] <hye> oh console, let me check that
[19:12:49] <tw2113> open up firebug and click the console tab
[19:13:05] <hye> tw2113 it works... great thanks
[19:13:09] <hye> dont know why it doesnt work in my code
[19:13:17] <tw2113> i copy/pasted your code
[19:13:24] <tw2113> alert isn't the same as console.log
[19:14:02] <hye> thanks for taking the time!
[19:14:09] <tw2113> no worries
[19:14:18] <tw2113> lost a minute of time clipping my fingernails
[19:14:24] <hye> ;)
[19:14:35] <hye> I am running that code in:  success: function (msg) {}
[19:14:41] <hye> in $.ajax
[19:14:52] <hye> and in there, the console just shows the whole jquery, and doesnt loop
[19:14:55] <tw2113> why didn't you show that code?
[19:15:02] <tw2113> you just showed a portion
[19:15:04] <tw2113> not all of it
[19:17:26] <hye> http://pastebin.com/Fa7CLbFL
[19:18:33] <tw2113> not sure what type of result that's bringing in, and i can't test it myself because i don't have access to that test.asmx
[19:18:54] <hye> i got it to work tw2113
[19:18:56] <hye> i did var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(msg.d);
[19:19:05] <hye> then looped through that
[19:19:10] <hye> thanks so much tw2113
[19:19:17] <tw2113> ;)

[20:05:55] <astropirate> phonebook_, you are right, we do hate you
[20:08:40] <coldhead> the only thing i hate is intolerance
[20:08:43] <coldhead> and gypsies
[20:11:28] <phonebook_> you honestly hate me?
[20:11:38] <coldhead> of course not

[20:16:30] <abjorn> damn them
[20:16:45] <abjorn> idk what gypsies do, what are they known for? I have no idea.
[20:17:26] <coldhead> their main scourges are curses and dumping burned mattresses in your yard
[20:17:35] <coldhead> also they drink blood and steal children
[20:17:44] <coldhead> and they never cut their finger nails
[20:17:47] <coldhead> only "file"
[20:17:49] <coldhead> like "ladies"
[20:18:14] <abjorn> well
[20:18:18] <abjorn> the curses are bad, yeah
[20:18:31] <abjorn> you could...idk, maybe you could do something with the free matresses
[20:34:40] <phonebook_> do you really think you are going to bring the power plants back up with jquery after december 21st 2012? yeah right
[20:35:17] <coldhead> i'm not sure anyone thinks that
[20:36:08] <abjorn> wait

[20:54:51] <abjorn> psh
[20:54:52] <abjorn> so what

[20:55:12] * phonebook_ ponders cmos and unpluggint the internet connection and the registry... oh no
[20:55:28] * phonebook_ changing time zone
[20:55:55] <abjorn> $ vimtutor
[20:55:55] <abjorn> ^ Visual Studio is no longer necessary.
[20:58:13] <phonebook_> microsoft has been threatening me for the last 30 days

[21:01:42] <abjorn> I've converted a man
[21:01:44] <abjorn> feels good
[21:10:31] <jacobroufa> hey room
[21:11:11] <jacobroufa> im pulling data into a widget on a setTimeout and for some reason my tabs arent reinitializing
[21:11:22] <jacobroufa> http://lostriverweb.com/d/election/widget.html
[21:12:07] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/rrs.js tabs are init'd on line 39
[21:12:45] <jacobroufa> any ideas?
[21:13:28] <coldhead> setTimeout expects a function
[21:13:31] <coldhead> and a period
[21:13:34] <fission6> if i have a list of classes how can i select using the list of classes
[21:13:44] <coldhead> setTimeout(function () {alert('aids');}, 3000)
[21:13:55] <coldhead> oh wait that's what you have
[21:13:58] <coldhead> good old aids
[21:13:59] <jacobroufa> right, its getting that :)
[21:14:25] <coldhead> $.proxy(this.getData, this)
[21:14:40] <coldhead> that's one of those Advanced jQuery things, isn'tit
[21:14:51] <coldhead> way out of my league
[21:15:01] <jacobroufa> it just returns the data
[21:15:04] <jacobroufa> thats all
[21:15:15] <jacobroufa> and then the data is passed to my "widget" function on line 35
[21:15:30] <jacobroufa> which grabs the data, on the specified intervals, and reinits the tabs
[21:15:36] <jacobroufa> rather, thats what its supposed to do
[21:16:51] <coldhead> this is too clever for me to read
[21:17:00] <coldhead> all the this and proxy and promises
[21:17:05] <coldhead> i'm too stupido
[21:17:05] <jacobroufa> ignore the getResults part
[21:17:08] <jacobroufa> lol
[21:17:25] <coldhead> if i were trying to debug this
[21:17:28] <coldhead> i would put
[21:17:31] <coldhead> debugger;
[21:17:37] <coldhead> as the first line in widget()
[21:17:44] <coldhead> and see if it gets called
[21:17:47] <coldhead> and what it gets passed
[21:18:50] <strathmeyer> jacobroufa: why are you using a setTimeout?  did you mean for this to happen every 10 seconds?  that would be setInterval
[21:19:43] <jacobroufa> strathmeyer: yes im meaning for it to happen every 10 sec
[21:20:37] <strathmeyer> well, you could use setInterval instead of setTimeout but keep in mind that altering the interval variable after you first call setInterval won't have an effect
[21:20:58] <jacobroufa> setInterval ignores errors
[21:21:10] <jacobroufa> using the pattern from http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[21:22:08] <strathmeyer> ah nice.
[21:22:28] <jacobroufa> coldhead: tbh never used debugger... :X
[21:24:19] <coldhead> jacobroufa: it's witchcraft. highly useful witchcraft
[21:24:22] <strathmeyer> so, it's making the calls out to http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/results/?q=r&callback=jQuery18201333069084212184_1352179388342&_=1352179449753
[21:24:39] <strathmeyer> and http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/results?q=r&callback=jQuery18201333069084212184_1352179388342&_=1352179469756
[21:25:44] <strathmeyer> ah. looks like you're making a request for the url without the "/" after results and that always redirects.
[21:25:47] <jacobroufa> strathmeyer: yeah. really just http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/results?q=r - the rest is just jsonp
[21:26:01] <strathmeyer> yup and it's returning info.
[21:26:06] <strathmeyer> no console errors.
[21:26:14] <strathmeyer> what makes you think that it's not updating?
[21:26:15] <jacobroufa> right
[21:26:17] <jacobroufa> no
[21:26:18] <coldhead> in the winter 'round the ruined mill
[21:26:19] <jacobroufa> it is updating lol
[21:26:22] <jacobroufa> its the tabs that break
[21:26:30] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take five
[21:26:31] <jacobroufa> the tabs render only on the first ajax call
[21:26:33] <jacobroufa> not on the rest
[21:27:06] <jacobroufa> strathmeyer: the tabs break on the second ajax request
[21:27:12] <jacobroufa> is it not doing that for you?
[21:27:20] <strathmeyer> not sure.
[21:27:28] <strathmeyer> I don't know how the tabs are supposed to work, or even where they are.
[21:28:14] <coldhead> it's just above the caps lock key
[21:28:21] <jacobroufa> strathmeyer: each of the #results ul li are tabs, with corresponding data in divs below the ul
[21:28:27] <strathmeyer> oh. I see it now.
[21:28:38] <strathmeyer> takes a long time to load the first time, and then loads the second time (breaking the tabs) quickly.
[21:28:44] <strathmeyer> so I was missing the "working" tabs.
[21:28:44] <jacobroufa> yeah
[21:28:48] <jacobroufa> yup
[21:28:51] <jacobroufa> sry
[21:29:04] <jacobroufa> i gotta change the timeout to something more reasonable for working with lol
[21:30:10] <fission6> so if i have an array of strings that are class names, whats the best way to use them all as selectors
[21:30:34] <strathmeyer> jacobroufa: what is ".done( widget, self.init() )" supposed to do?
[21:30:38] <fission6> $(' .'.join(some_array)
[21:30:40] <strathmeyer> it looks like it's passing two done functions?
[21:31:40] <fission6> does that make sense?
[21:31:50] <jacobroufa> strathmeyer: thats what calls the widget function, and then starts the setTimeout again
[21:32:11] <strathmeyer> i see.  are you supposed to be able to pass more than one function to .done()?
[21:33:09] <strathmeyer> I mean, it seems to be working, but I can't find any jquery documentation that shows that.
[21:33:16] <jacobroufa> strathmeyer: yep. can pass as many as you want
[21:33:20] <strathmeyer> ok.
[21:33:21] <jacobroufa> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[21:33:30] <strathmeyer> ah. thanks.
[21:33:43] <coldhead> fission6: http://jsfiddle.net/D3NUr/ ?
[21:34:53] <coldhead> more neatly http://jsfiddle.net/D3NUr/1/
[21:37:22] <strathmeyer> jacobroufa: I think it might be because .tabs() is called twice?
[21:37:58] <strathmeyer> not sure.  gotta go.   Try putting some console.log()s in there to make sure you're getting the right info into the widget() function.
[21:38:27] <fission6> coldhead: ok thanks
[21:51:40] <relipse>  any programmers want to try out my latest creation, a time logger to bill your employer
[21:52:15] <coldhead> sure why not
[21:53:34] <scar> relipse ill try it out
[21:54:20] <relipse> ok cworklog.com
[21:55:45] <coldhead> i'm not sure if i agree to the terms and conditions
[21:56:15] <relipse> lol there are none silly
[21:57:38] <relipse> anyway registration is quick email doesnt even need to be verified
[21:59:44] <coldhead> this is very rich and detailed, relipse
[21:59:47] <coldhead> you should be proud
[22:00:02] <coldhead> i like how the icon changes if i am already clocked in
[22:01:24] <relipse> you like it ch?
[22:01:31] <relipse> yeah i got annoyed
[22:01:42] <relipse> and i didnt feel like implementing a constant ajax stream
[22:02:42] <coldhead> i also like watching the money come in
[22:02:45] <coldhead> each second
[22:02:50] <coldhead> makes me feel like a rich guy
[22:02:52] <relipse> yeah!! me too
[22:03:03] <relipse> all minor improvements i wanted for myself
[22:03:15] <coldhead> i put in my actual hourly rate but it said "Integer overflow"
[22:03:20] <coldhead> i guess i should reduce my rate
[22:03:27] <coldhead> (it didn't really say that)
[22:03:53] <relipse> i actually use this time logger and have been using it for the past 37 weeks
[22:04:17] <coldhead> that's a lot of weeks
[22:04:19] <coldhead> and a lot of $$
[22:05:35] <relipse> although i have one on my laptop instead of using the web server
[22:05:43] <relipse> my idea is to sell downloadable copies
[22:05:52] <relipse> but provide the online one for free
[22:05:57] <relipse> are you on a windows machine?
[22:13:16] <relipse> coldhead, anyway if you are on a windows box and you want to try out a GUI i made for it, http://cworklog.com/downloads/WorkLogGui_0887.zip
[22:19:39] <coldhead> no windows for me, relipse
[22:19:54] <coldhead> i only use communist operating systems
[22:20:06] <grafi> oO
[22:21:08] <Mohsen_Hassani> Using appendTo() I'm appending some <option> to a <select> and I see the items are added, but when I want to $("#my_select").val("a_value") it's not selected as default!
[22:23:25] <coldhead> jsfiddle dat Mohsen_Hassani
[22:23:51] <relipse> oh you could try it on wine
[22:23:55] <relipse> maybe that would work i dont know
[22:26:23] <Mohsen_Hassani> coldhead, The data are retrieved from a json file, I don't know how to set that file in jsfiddle.net;
[22:29:00] <coldhead> you could just paste the JSON in your JS
[22:29:02] <coldhead> and use it
[22:29:15] <coldhead> because JSON is Just Javascript
[22:29:26] <coldhead> i do that all the time
[22:34:35] <aqeel> hi room
[22:35:05] <aqeel> how can i work with object tag and make use of focusin and focusout in opera
[22:35:32] <aqeel> opera is not responding properly
[22:35:53] <aqeel> if i use p it is perfectly ok....but i want it on object
[22:36:19] <aqeel> <p><span><object></object></span></p>
[22:41:01] <Cork> aqeel: object is a replaced object, and historically browsers has had quite big problems with handling events on them
[22:41:26] <Cork> aqeel: haven't checked opera for objects lately, but the work around you describe is what used to be the solution
[22:41:50] <aqeel> ok thanks
[22:41:53] <Cork> aqeel: so i suspect its still needed there
[22:51:42] <rethus> i have a jquery selectbox plugin installed, which creates a div-layerd pulldown of an <select>-Box.. But if i click on it, it got a gold border, and i doesn't found where this is set. http://www.aerobis.com/shop/en/index?sasu=1
[22:52:04] <rethus> its the "currency-field" above in the middle
[22:53:22] <Cork> rethus: where on the page is it located?
[22:53:31] <rethus> upper middle
[22:53:42] <rethus> left beside the flags
[22:54:00] <Cork> ah there
[22:54:11] <rethus> and this is the plugin: http://www.bulgaria-web-developers.com/projects/javascript/selectbox/
[22:54:27] <Cork> i don't see any gold border
[22:54:34] <Cork> in what browser is this?
[22:54:51] <rethus> even if you click on the selectbox to choose something?
[22:54:58] <Cork> yes
[22:54:59] <rethus> chrome on linux
[22:55:50] <rethus> on konqueror it's look also great
[22:56:10] <Cork> anyway the ring you're talking about is most likely the focus ring from webkit
[22:57:16] <Cork> http://camendesign.com/code/uth6_beautiful_css_dates/google-focus-ring.png wrong color here but...
[22:57:28] <rethus> but i don't have it on other links on the page
[22:58:07] <rethus> focus-cing is blue on my system
[22:58:13] <rethus> wait, i make a screenshot
[22:58:33] <Cork> rethus: try setting select:focus { outline:none; }
[22:58:54] <rethus> http://wstaw.org/m/2012/11/06/plasma-desktopjt4083.png
[22:58:54] <faraway> rethus: it has a tabindex thats why webkit displays a focus border
[22:58:56] <rethus> k
[22:59:02] <codeshah> hey guys, I have a long list of <div> elements (very long) and I want to do something like an infinite scroll on it the thing is that it is already output on the page. Is there any infinite scroll plugin that hides parts of the page and slowly loads it as you rscorll down?
[22:59:08] <Cork> rethus: ya, thats the focus ring
[23:00:39] <Cork> rethus: ah, missed that one so sbHolder:focus { outline:none; } should do the trick
[23:00:52] <faraway> Cork: you missed the . :P
[23:01:39] <Cork> ya :/
[23:02:42] <rethus> yes, great. you save my day
[23:03:06] <rethus> Thanks Cork
[23:05:57] <codeshah> hey guys, I have a long list of <div> elements (very long) and I want to do something like an infinite scroll on it the thing is that it is already output on the page. Is there any infinite scroll plugin that hides parts of the page and slowly loads it as you rscorll down?
[23:07:14] <grafi> if its already loaded ... its already loaded
[23:07:37] <codeshah> grafi: hmm k
[23:08:18] <grafi> i mean the purpose of infinite scroll is to load the page in small portions to speed up loading times isnt it?
[23:08:54] <grafi> so the gains of having infinite scroll in place are lost when the page is already fully loaded :o
[23:10:47] <aqeel> codeshah....http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[23:12:21] <aqeel> codeshah.......http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[23:12:56] * grafi replaces google with aqeel from now on
[23:13:10] <codeshah> lol
[23:13:26] <codeshah> well, I did search extensively but all the scroll items seem to require the 'next page' data
[23:13:45] <grafi> which makes sense
[23:13:47] <codeshah> I have a really long page already output and what I was ideally wanting to do is have jQuery catch and "fold" the page
[23:13:59] <codeshah> so it seems a bit more user friendly
[23:14:10] <codeshah> and as he scrolls down, it reveals more
[23:14:17] <codeshah> couldnt find naything :(
[23:14:40] <aqeel> http://www.webdeveloperjuice.com/2012/05/26/10-aggressively-used-jquery-infinite-scroll-plugins-for-endless-paging/
[23:14:52] <Cork> codeshah: infinite scroll by definition means that its not on the page
[23:15:06] <Cork> bah... was in scroll back >_<'
[23:15:24] <grafi> :D
[23:15:32] <grafi> welcome back^^
[23:15:43] <Cork> codeshah: anyway the point of intinite scroll is that you don't have it inpage
[23:15:54] <codeshah> yup
[23:15:56] <Cork> you just load say the first 50
[23:15:57] <codeshah> you are right
[23:16:03] <Cork> and the rest is served over ajax
[23:16:15] <Cork> else you would just have a normal page
[23:17:01] <Cork> love it when you write a response to a question and then go "hmm why didn't it show" -_-'
[23:17:07] <aqeel> create 2 page.....one where the content must be loaded into and other full of entire content use plugin on where it must be loaded and shows as scrolled
[23:17:43] <Cork> codeshah: is the div's based on database entries?
[23:19:01] <jacobroufa> ive got a widget that uses ui tabs http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/rrs.html but when i load in new content the tabs break...
[23:19:21] <jacobroufa> http://e-rockford.com/elections/widget/widget.js line 39 is the tab init
[23:19:24] <jacobroufa> any ideas?
[23:19:38] <codeshah> Cork: let me try to figure it out
[23:19:41] <codeshah> thanks for the directions :)
[23:38:12] <swe_ET> how do I access metods inside my self-invoked jquery plugin ? I thougth it would be attached to the DOM element
[23:45:49] <Cork> swe_ET: how have you defined the methods?
[23:48:34] <swe_ET> I use Object.create()
[23:48:51] <Cork> huh?
[23:49:03] <swe_ET> and have an Object ..  { init: {},  . someMethod:funktion (){}..
[23:49:06] <Cork> swe_ET: where do you attach the methods
[23:49:24] <swe_ET> function even..
[23:49:27] <Cork> no need for Object.create
[23:49:31] <Cork> this isn't java
[23:49:44] <Cork> just do { name: function() {}, ...}
[23:49:54] <Cork> but where do you attach the object
[23:51:44] <Cork> depending on what you want you either create a portal (alla widgetfactory) and have a private object that you allow access to through that portal
[23:51:57] <Cork> or you simply just make all the functions public
[23:52:15] <Cork> either way for them to be public you need to attach them to either $ or $.fn
[23:52:22] <swe_ET> i do $.fn.myPlugin = fucntion( return this.each( function(){ var O = Object.create(MyPlugin); O.init( options, this); }});
[23:52:38] <Cork> O is private there
[23:52:43] <Cork> only you can access it
[23:52:55] <grafi> function is spelled wrong ;) in case thats a real paste
[23:53:12] <swe_ET> nah.. just typning typo..
[23:53:45] <swe_ET> So O is not returned ?
[23:53:57] <Cork> you don't define any return so no
[23:54:16] <Cork> javascript doens't have implicit returns
[23:54:34] <swe_ET> I do it on  return this.each(...
[23:55:18] <Cork> sure that returns the value returned from each == jQuery
[23:56:38] <swe_ET> ah so to be able to talk to my O instance , i need to attach it to my element ?
[23:57:15] <Cork> if you want to return the results from the loop you need to use $.map(this, function(elm) { return new MyPlugin().init(options, this); })
[23:57:22] <Cork> swe_ET: not really
[23:57:32] <Cork> swe_ET: it depends on what you want to do
[23:57:49] <Cork> and honestly  O = Object.create(MyPlugin); makes no sense
[23:58:32] <Cork> unless thats a complicated way of writeing new...
[23:58:35] * Cork checks
[23:58:46] <Cork> heh it is
[23:58:49] <Cork> interesting
