[00:00:46] <gf3> dblosevn: Also, not cool using "gay" in the pejorative sense
[00:03:44] <dblosevn> hmm muh bad lol
[00:03:50] <dblosevn> i got it :-)
[00:04:48] <dblosevn> I made an ext plugin that generates an editable grid from an existing html table, that supports drag and drop row reordering :-)
[00:05:23] <mazzachre> Is this the correct way to find direct child divs of something $('>div', something)
[00:06:18] <dblosevn> $('div').children().each(function() { } ); :-)
[00:06:37] <gf3> mazzachre: What is `something`?
[00:07:02] <dblosevn> something would be the context
[00:07:07] <dblosevn> in his example
[00:07:11] <vin_> hi
[00:07:35] <ravenzz> mazzachre children()
[00:07:39] <gf3> mazzachre: Either way, if it's not already a jQ object you can do: $(something).find('> div')
[00:08:13] <dblosevn> or $('div', this).children()
[00:09:07] <mazzachre> My actual code is $('>div:nth(' + i + ')', this).width(width);
[00:09:24] <mazzachre> Where i is an index I am looking for... obviously :)
[00:09:26] <dblosevn> my brain hurts after readying that lmao
[00:09:31] <mazzachre> :D
[00:09:52] <mazzachre> What is a better way of doing that? Hopefully without string concatination
[00:09:59] <dblosevn> but that looks syntatically correct
[00:10:42] <gf3> mazzachre: $(this).children('div').eq(index)
[00:10:45] <mazzachre> It is... it works :) I just have some issue with the way it looks :) Purely esthetical :)
[00:10:53] <gf3> mazzachre: $(this).find('> div').eq(index)
[00:10:57] <dblosevn> mazzachre: do you want to set all child divs of `this` to the same width?
[00:11:18] <gf3> mazzachre: I'd use either of those two
[00:11:18] <mazzachre> No, I want to set the nth() div of this to width...
[00:11:34] <mazzachre> So, the 3rf. div is set to some with...
[00:11:43] <dblosevn> mazzachre: was just wondering as it looks like that line came out of a loop
[00:12:01] <gf3> mazzachre: E.g.: $(this).children('div').eq(2).width(200)
[00:12:12] <mazzachre> And basically if I could loose the div reference, so it is just the 3rd. child, that would be much better...
[00:12:18] <dblosevn> ++gf3
[00:12:49] <mazzachre> Ya... the i is set in another sub program, to match a different element, that I need the nth child of this element to have the same size as..
[00:13:08] <dblosevn> $(this_children().eq(i).width(width);
[00:13:45] <dblosevn> grr $(this).children().eq(i).width(width);
[00:14:25] <mazzachre> Thx dblosevn, Ya, I coudl read it first time around also... Works nicely, and is nicer to read :D
[00:15:13] <dblosevn> ya that one only mildly hurts my brain lmao
[00:15:15] <gf3> Also `slice` might be handy
[00:16:02] <mazzachre> slice?!
[00:16:10] <gf3> `api slice @ mazzachre
[00:16:11] <b-ot> mazzachre: .slice(): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[00:16:12] <djQuery> sorry off topic, steam finaly releasing more games for linuz
[00:16:17] <djQuery> linuz rather
[00:16:22] <gf3> LINUZZZ
[00:16:59] <djQuery> damn keyboard
[00:17:05] <gf3> Suuuuure
[00:17:34] <mazzachre> Ah.. Well, what would be nice would be to be able to select all the nth children of a list of elements...
[00:18:02] <djQuery> now if they would just work on portal and l4d2
[00:18:10] <ravenzz> gf3 do you know that your surname means tiny buttock in italian? :d
[00:18:13] <superware> in jqm, is there something like <input type="number" data-role="search" />? (vs. type="search")
[00:18:34] <gf3> ravenzz: It's ironic
[00:18:51] <mazzachre> So all 3rd. children of all li's in my current div...
[00:19:01] <ravenzz> yes lol I don't mean to be offensive :P
[00:19:19] <iaj> I got 2 little questions... I want to add a check for a certain checkbox to be checked if form #form is being submitted.. and the other thing I want is to prevent double-submitting if someone accidentally presses the submit button twice.
[00:19:25] <iaj> Are there any solutions for that in jQuery?
[00:19:57] <dblosevn> yep
[00:20:11] <gf3> ravenzz: No sir, you could never offend me
[00:21:08] <ravenzz> iaj let's start with the 2nd one, on beforeSend you disable the submit button, and on complete you enable it again
[00:21:23] <dblosevn> iaj: $('#form').submit(function() { $('#checkbox_id').prop('checked', true); $('#submit_button_id').prop('disabled'); return true; });
[00:21:32] <ravenzz> or you can store the ajax request state into a variable
[00:21:46] <dblosevn> sorry .prop('disabled', true);
[00:22:15] <dblosevn> wow im screwing up left and right .prop('disabled', 'disabled')
[00:22:19] <iaj> thats all? wow...
[00:22:29] <iaj> thanks :-)
[00:22:53] <dblosevn> also .prop('checked', 'checked')
[00:23:10] <iaj> that would include both my needs?
[00:23:14] <dblosevn> yes
[00:23:21] <iaj> sweet!
[00:23:23] <dblosevn> checks a checkbox and disables the submit button
[00:24:05] <dblosevn> youll need to replace #checkbox_id and #submit_button_id with the ids of these elements though
[00:24:17] <iaj> so its .prop('disabled', 'disabled') would disable the button?
[00:24:24] <dblosevn> yes
[00:24:26] <iaj> cool :)
[00:29:59] <Jac0bz1> Morning! Anyone got the time to look at something for me? I'm trying to create a function that will loop through a set of children, then showing one at the time, with an animation that fades the current down and the next up (simultaneously) http://jsfiddle.net/ut4M5/
[00:36:03] <iaj> dblosevn: basically this should be about right, if #ids and stuff 've been taken correctly right? http://pastie.org/6085693
[00:39:42] <cuqa__> hey, what does an array in jquery look like? when I use split() I get a comma separated list which I can also display with alert
[00:39:50] <dblosevn> Jac0bz1: http://jsfiddle.net/yydVZ/3/ thats kind of close
[00:40:06] <dblosevn> Jac0bz1: if i had more time i could get it to work but im kinda slammed
[00:40:27] <cuqa__> but other times when you have an array and try to alert() it, it only returns [object object] .. is that a json array?
[00:40:34] <dblosevn> iaj: ya
[00:41:25] <Nancy2012> Good morning to all
[00:42:20] <iaj> dblosevn: what might be the problem if submitting is possible? :)
[00:42:34] <dblosevn> cuqa__: alert(yourvar.toString());
[00:42:57] <cuqa__> i would just like to know if an array in jquery is just a comma separated list
[00:43:05] <dblosevn> iaj: if submitting is possible i would think there isnt a problem :-)
[00:43:11] <iaj> dblosevn: you got me :)
[00:43:27] <dblosevn> when you alert an array you will always get array
[00:44:14] <dblosevn> when dealing with arrays use arrayname.toString to get a human readable string
[00:44:31] <dblosevn> when dealing with objects use JSON.stringify(object)
[00:45:08] <dblosevn> or be like a normal developer and use console.log(varname) and you will get an object you can play with in the ocnsole
[00:45:54] <cuqa__> what confuses me is that websites, not necessarily documention, say that split() would give you an array
[00:46:03] <dblosevn> as it does
[00:46:07] <cuqa__> s/documention/documentation/
[00:46:37] <cuqa__> but I can alert the "array" which is created by split
[00:47:04] <iaj> dblosevn: to check I'd basically embedd an alert call after the submit() part - is that the irght approach?
[00:47:29] <dblosevn> cuqa__: i see, just tested and you are correct it seems alert is calling toString on the array
[00:47:33] <cuqa__> see what I mean .. http://jsfiddle.net/A6J5f/5/ .. enter anything in to the textarea, each line is supposed to be an element ..
[00:47:41] <cuqa__> and click ok
[00:48:27] <dblosevn> ?g javascript alert array gives comma delimited list
[00:48:28] <b-ot> dblosevn: jquery - Easy way to turn Javascript array into comma-separated list ... â†’ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/201724/easy-way-to-turn-javascript-array-into-comma-separated-list
[00:48:38] <dblosevn> oh well lol
[00:49:03] <dblosevn> cuqa__: console.log('123,456,789'.split(',')) dumps an array to the console
[00:49:32] <dblosevn> cuqa__: alert('123,456,789'.split(',')); alerts a , delimited string to console
[00:49:59] <dblosevn> well not to the console it simply alerts
[00:50:19] <cuqa__> never used that console
[00:50:25] <cuqa__> gotta start. .. thanks
[00:50:35] <dblosevn> the only explanation to that is that alert calls the toString method if it exists on the object
[00:51:22] <dblosevn> cuqa__: console.log('123,456,789'.split(',').toString()) dumps a comma delimited list to the console
[00:57:53] <marcules> Good Morning :)
[01:01:20] <cuqa__> sick newb question incoming
[01:01:56] <cuqa__> why do you sometimes need the $ sign and sometimes you dont, e.g. alert() works without, but $.trim() requires the $
[01:02:39] <marcules> alert() is from standard javascript, but trim is from your library, in this case jQuery
[01:03:02] <cuqa__> i see
[01:03:13] <Cork> cuqa__: if you want to have a prefix you can use window.alert :)
[01:03:29] <Cork> on the other hand you can use window.$.trim too :D
[01:03:51] <marcules> cuqa__, but you can also use some standard javascript functions on jQuery objects
[01:04:26] <cuqa__> okay, makes sense. thanks
[01:08:45] <dblosevn> Cork: i gave up trying to find a grid that did what i wanted it to do in jquery and ended up writing an ext plugin that converts an html table into an ext grid thats editable and supports drag and drop reordering takes like 5 minutes to implement
[01:09:35] <dblosevn> after crashing for 10 hours lmao
[01:13:22] <dblosevn> Cork: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/53
[01:14:47] <dblosevn> Wish I would have had more time to build a jquery ui version but ext already had like 90% of the work doen for me
[01:24:00] <jrockjiggz> i'm looking for a work around to get scripts to evaluate when using html();  i've found i can use $.globalEval(), but im faced with duplicate bindings even though i am using .die(event)
[01:24:03] <jrockjiggz> ?globalEval
[01:28:18] <johanhar> I have this problem with jquery-ui and dynatree. I have the newest version of jquery ui (higher than 1.8) and the newest version of dynatree. When I initialize dynatree, it's being initialized twice! This is the error/warning I get: ui.dynatree._init() was called; you should upgrade to jquery.ui.core.js v1.8 or higher.
[01:34:16] <koskoz> hi
[01:34:32] <koskoz> do you know any plugin simulating the "marquee" tag?
[01:35:01] <koskoz> but with multiuple elements
[01:35:19] <Anticom> johanhar what jq-ui version u got?
[01:35:35] <koskoz> For instances, one sentence per <li> and all those li just slides one after the other
[01:35:40] <Anticom> koskoz what do you mean with multiple elements?
[01:35:58] <Anticom> koskoz you're probably looking for a news ticker plugin
[01:36:25] <Anticom> koskoz http://www.gcmingati.net/wordpress/wp-content/lab/jquery/newsticker/jq-liscroll/scrollanimate.html
[01:36:33] <Anticom> is this, what you want?
[01:37:00] <Anticom> you could use that one aswell: http://www.jquerynewsticker.com/
[01:37:19] <johanhar> Anticom: I fixed with a new version of dynatree, seems they updated and I didn't have the newest after all.
[01:37:28] <johanhar> :)
[01:37:35] <Anticom> ok
[01:37:46] <johanhar> So if you don't have the most up to date dynatree, you can't use jquery ui 1.10
[01:37:54] <Anticom> always remember to watch your cache... bad thing happened to me because firefox was tricking me
[01:38:08] <johanhar> Yeah
[01:38:18] <Anticom> koskoz is that what you wanted?
[01:38:20] * johanhar back to work
[01:38:34] * Anticom moar coffee
[01:38:40] <Anticom> ^_^
[01:38:54] <jrockjiggz> ?die vs bind?
[01:38:59] <jrockjiggz> ?die vs unbind?
[01:39:38] <Anticom> jq API docs concerning .die(): "version deprecated: 1.7, removed: 1.9"
[01:39:42] <Anticom> use bind / unbind
[01:39:44] <Cork> dblosevn: heh
[01:39:53] <Anticom> mornin' Cork :)
[01:39:53] <Cork> you bailed huh? :D
[01:40:05] <Cork> o/
[01:40:32] <Cork> jrockjiggz: .live => .die
[01:40:37] <Cork> .bind => .unbind
[01:40:41] <Anticom> oh rly :O
[01:40:49] <Anticom> i can't unbind .live handlers with unbind?
[01:40:49] <jrockjiggz> Cork: .on => ?
[01:40:52] <Cork> of
[01:40:56] <Cork> *.off
[01:40:56] <Anticom> haha
[01:41:00] <jrockjiggz> oh
[01:41:08] <Cork> delegate undelegate
[01:41:18] <Anticom> egg => chicken
[01:41:21] <Cork> XD
[01:41:25] <Anticom> :P
[01:41:32] <Anticom> cow => burger
[01:41:37] <jrockjiggz> Cork: ty, been at this for a while
[01:41:37] <Anticom> i could use one right now
[01:41:41] <dblosevn> Cork: had no choice got to get this done
[01:42:00] <Anticom> but again... can't i unbind handlers set by .live() with .unbind() ?
[01:42:00] <Cork> i don't see now burger is the opposite to cow...
[01:42:15] <Anticom> egg isn't the opposite of chicken either...
[01:42:17] <Cork> no
[01:42:22] <Anticom> good to know
[01:42:43] <Anticom> think i might have to review some custom plugins using .live() :/
[01:42:44] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'a') $('a').unbind() ???
[01:42:45] <jrockjiggz> I did however find .on() => .unbind() to be successful
[01:42:48] <koskoz> Anticom: thanks!
[01:42:54] <Cork> jrockjiggz: depends
[01:42:56] <Anticom> koskoz ur welcome
[01:43:02] <Cork> if you use delegation or not in .on
[01:43:13] <Cork> you should never mix though
[01:43:14] <dblosevn> burger == typeOf(result of cow)
[01:43:32] <jrockjiggz> Cork: lesson learned
[01:43:40] <Cork> .on('click', 'a') .off('click', 'a')
[01:43:57] <Anticom> dblosevn 1up
[01:45:41] <jrockjiggz> Cork: I keep my jQuery in the related file it is used, which is 90% likely it is loaded by ajax.   when the js is evaluated, i get duplicate bindings.  I prevent this by $('el').off('click').on('click', function(){}); which works well -- but i've never seen any examples like that
[01:46:34] <Cork> jrockjiggz: why do you get duplicate bindings?
[01:46:47] <jrockjiggz> because the js is evaluated over and over
[01:47:03] <Cork> and... you should prob prevent that?
[01:47:28] <jrockjiggz> the jquery snippet is included in the response, and i prevent it by unbinding, binding
[01:47:43] <jrockjiggz> sounds flawed
[01:47:51] <Cork> why are you including it in each ajax response if its already loaded on the page by default?
[01:48:06] <Cork> theres where you do the mistake
[01:48:56] <jrockjiggz> the idea was to prevent loading an entire website's worth of js at once, by breaking up the relavant Js into the file being loaded
[01:49:24] <jrockjiggz> and it is nice to work with having the js in the same file
[01:49:31] <Cork> then you should bind the event listeners locally to the section you insert
[01:49:37] <Cork> not to all elements on the page
[01:50:11] <jrockjiggz> would that not still allow for duplicate binding?
[01:50:18] <Cork> no
[01:50:25] <Trisox> o/
[01:50:37] <jrockjiggz> ++
[01:50:37] <Cork> as you only bind to the element you just insert, they won't have any event listeners
[01:50:40] <snimavat> Can any one help me deciding a solution for filedownload issue, I need to stream a file from server, but preparing the file may take upto 2/3 minutes.. how do i handle this situation.. what would be the best way for such situation ?
[01:50:48] <Cork> unless you do delegated event listeners, that is
[01:50:55] <Trisox> snimavat: what file
[01:50:57] <Cork> and if you do, those should be set in the main ile
[01:51:01] <Cork> Trisox: o/
[01:51:04] <snimavat> Its an Excel file
[01:51:08] <Trisox> Cork: :D
[01:51:34] <Trisox> stream = downloading?
[01:51:46] <Trisox> they aint the same :)
[01:51:50] <Cork> snimavat: you could generate it and give a session id through ajax
[01:51:56] <Cork> then have ajax pull for when its ready
[01:52:00] <Cork> then trigger the download
[01:52:01] <snimavat> Trisox - i need to prepare and thn stream a excell file.. but whole process can take 2/3 minutes and results in client aborting the connection
[01:52:10] <snimavat> Cork !! any example ?
[01:52:17] <Cork> snimavat: no
[01:52:26] <snimavat> Cork - some more details ?
[01:52:33] <Trisox> hmm make a wait message with the time frame in it
[01:52:43] <jrockjiggz> Cork: im still not 100% how delegation works.. how did you mean: lcal event listener.  to me that would be $('el').on('click') -- yet that persists even though I am replacing the content with .html('')
[01:52:45] <Trisox> wy 2/3 min
[01:52:54] <Trisox> thats so long
[01:52:59] <Trisox> how big a file is it
[01:53:24] <snimavat> Its not a big file.. but we have to query various apis to get the data for file
[01:53:36] <snimavat> but still file can have 2000/3000 records
[01:53:44] <Trisox> hmm
[01:53:44] <Cork> snimavat:  $.ajax('url', { data: { some:'data' } }).done(function(done){ pull_for_compleation() });
[01:54:15] <snimavat> will this work across all browser without client dropping connection ?
[01:54:24] <Cork> jrockjiggz: delegated event listners is set on an element that doesn't change, with a filter for a child that do change
[01:54:30] <Cork> jrockjiggz: like $('body
[01:54:30] <snimavat> even if server doesnt stream file for say 3/4 minutes
[01:54:31] <Cork> opps
[01:54:53] <Cork> jrockjiggz: like $('body').on('click', 'a', function(event) { event.preventDefault() });
[01:55:11] <snimavat> Cork !!
[01:55:13] <Cork> jrockjiggz: unless you remove that event listener it will stay around
[01:55:37] <Cork> snimavat: the way i put it its meant to be done by a server process
[01:55:44] <Cork> then stored with a request id
[01:55:59] <Cork> javascript would pull every x seconds to see if its done
[01:56:26] <Cork> and when it is do location = "download/path?id=reference_id";
[01:56:27] <snimavat> Okey, so u mean start a new server process.. and pull every second from browser to see if its done
[01:56:28] <Trisox> or use push serversided .. way more complicated
[01:56:33] <Cork> and the server would send the generated file
[01:56:40] <snimavat> and start downloading when done ?
[01:56:42] <Cork> Trisox: you can't really do push
[01:56:47] <Cork> snimavat: yes
[01:56:54] <Trisox> Cork:  wy not
[01:56:59] <snimavat> Okey, so its like polling ?
[01:57:05] <Trisox> no its polling :D
[01:57:08] <Cork> Trisox: cause that would mean the server connecting to the client
[01:57:14] <Cork> and you can't on the web
[01:57:19] <Trisox> Cork: exactly
[01:57:20] <Cork> without websocket that is
[01:57:26] <Trisox> comet server thingy
[01:57:28] <Trisox> for example
[01:57:31] <snimavat> how would i poll ? any plugin recommendation ?
[01:57:34] <Cork> thats still pulling
[01:57:38] <snimavat> yeah i dont want to go for comet
[01:57:40] <Trisox> hmm
[01:57:55] <Trisox> well just use timeout
[01:58:04] <Cork> snimavat: i would just use a setTimeout $.ajax loop
[01:58:21] <snimavat> humm this way i can have progressbar as well.. isnt it ?
[01:58:26] <snimavat> every time i can return progress
[01:58:32] <fattest> hello
[01:58:42] <snimavat> Cork !
[01:58:56] <fattest> im trying to put airport text on a div. can any1 help? http://jsfiddle.net/janjarfalk/2heQT/1/
[01:58:57] <Cork> funciton pull(id) { $.ajax('url/pull', data:{ id: id }).done(function() { pull(id); }); }
[01:59:07] <Trisox> Cork:  he could do polling with setInterval
[01:59:10] <jrockjiggz> cork: i understand that much of delegation, it is very useful.. my concern is direct event binding: $('el').on('click') to an element in the dom that is replaced by html(data);  i find using on() persists the previous bound event, even though it is a new element
[01:59:11] <Cork> no
[01:59:29] <Cork> Trisox: setInterval is a BAD idea if you don't know how long the pull will take
[01:59:46] <fattest> how do i put that jsfiddle on a div tag with an id? http://jsfiddle.net/janjarfalk/2heQT/1/
[01:59:50] <snimavat> Cork - so do u recommend any plugin for polling ?
[01:59:55] <Trisox> hmm well using the done .. how would you do that..
[02:00:01] <Cork> snimavat: donno if there is one
[02:00:07] <Cork> i always write it close to what i gave you
[02:00:14] <Anticom> Trisox what are you trying to do?
[02:00:25] <Trisox> i'm not trying to do anything ;)
[02:00:38] <Trisox> discusion about polling with ajax...
[02:00:43] <Cork> Trisox: done is just another way to write complete: function() {} on ajax
[02:01:05] <fattest> can any1 help?
[02:01:32] <snimavat> Humm... i would do some google for polling with jquery..t
[02:01:34] <Cork> fattest: the question is almost not possible to answer
[02:01:36] <Anticom> so what's the matter about that Trisox ?
[02:01:37] <snimavat> there might be some thign readymade
[02:01:38] <Trisox> Cork: i know
[02:01:48] <fattest> cork: ?
[02:01:57] <Trisox> http://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery
[02:02:16] <Cork> fattest: i have no clue what airport does, so how should i be able to tell what you need to change on that line?
[02:02:16] <snimavat> how about this https://github.com/RobertFischer/JQuery-PeriodicalUpdater
[02:02:19] <Trisox> didnt read the whole article but code examples look usefull
[02:02:28] <snimavat> https://github.com/RobertFischer/JQuery-PeriodicalUpdater
[02:02:35] <Cork> ah its a library
[02:02:37] <Cork> missed that
[02:02:40] <fattest> cork: i provided a jsfiddle?
[02:03:03] <Cork> fattest: just guessing, but do you want to use an id instead of 'body'?
[02:03:22] <fattest> cork: yes
[02:03:24] <Cork> fattest: ya, but theres no html structure
[02:03:27] <NoWired> hi again
[02:03:33] <snimavat> And we already use https://github.com/RobertFischer/JQuery-PeriodicalUpdater at one place in our project
[02:03:37] <fattest> cork: what do u mean
[02:03:38] <Cork> fattest: so just replace the 'body' section with your id selector
[02:03:38] <snimavat> so this should work
[02:03:46] <fattest> cork: what about the text?
[02:03:55] <fattest> cork: moscow, berlin etc
[02:03:56] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/2heQT/3307/
[02:04:04] <Trisox> thats with an id
[02:04:25] <NoWired> Cork, one question about raphaeljs, I can make an image, but, now, I want to draw over it, do you know any way to get the "coord points" to can make this?
[02:04:29] <fattest> trisox: oh thank u
[02:04:35] <fattest> cork: and thank u cok too
[02:04:38] <fattest> cork: cork*
[02:04:42] <Trisox> jquery accepts css selectors ;)
[02:04:48] <Cork> NoWired: select the element
[02:04:58] <Cork> NoWired: its inline svg/vml :)
[02:06:15] <Cork> NoWired: but you might just have to use the list of elements you can get from raphael
[02:06:25] <Cork> NoWired: it depends on how creative you need to be
[02:06:54] <Cork> getBBox() might be enough for you
[02:07:29] <NoWired> the problem, is that I get the SVG from a jpg, and this creates only one SVG "path"
[02:08:59] <Anticom> Trisox i'd set a timeout in success method of ajax call
[02:09:11] <NoWired> for example, i try to use a spanish map for testing, but i don't get the coords of the differents provinces
[02:09:14] <fattest> trisox: its not working on my site. the text doesn't show up i imported everything!
[02:09:21] <Trisox> haha
[02:09:52] <Anticom> ?
[02:10:13] <Anticom> that way you'll wait an interval from the time on, the response came
[02:10:14] <Trisox> $(document).ready(function() { here your code });
[02:10:18] <Trisox> fattest
[02:10:21] <Trisox> try that
[02:10:27] <Trisox> ?ready
[02:10:27] <b-ot> Trisox: called as soon as the DOM tree is parsed.
[02:10:31] <Trisox> :D
[02:10:32] <Anticom> it's got to be "your code here" :P
[02:10:42] <Anticom> otherwise you'll get a syntax error^^
[02:10:52] <fattest> trisox: can i pm u
[02:11:05] <Trisox> no just do it here ;)
[02:11:16] <Trisox> some one else might also find it usefull
[02:11:39] <fattest> trisox: http://pastebin.com/t5H4HwqM am i doing anything wrong. and at the bottom, i have the div airport id
[02:12:16] <Cork> fattest: does that id exist on the page?
[02:12:47] <fattest> cork:                                   <div id="airport"></div>
[02:13:12] <fattest> cork: its at the bottom of the coding though
[02:13:19] <Cork> your doing this at the end of body?
[02:13:48] <Trisox> fattest: http://pastebin.com/BV0s3aGC
[02:14:11] <Cork> Trisox: you shouldn't use .ready if its at the end of body
[02:14:25] <Trisox> i know but dont know where he got this
[02:14:35] <fattest> cork: im uploading my whole index.php file?
[02:14:38] <Cork> so ask first instead
[02:14:39] <Trisox> using js at the end of your body is like so 2007
[02:14:49] <Cork> fattest: just tell where you have this section
[02:14:57] <fattest> cork: what section?
[02:15:12] <Cork> <!-- AIRPORT START --> ... <!-- AIRPORT END -->
[02:15:18] <fattest> <head>
[02:15:20] <fattest> under it
[02:15:30] <Cork> ok, then what Trisox said is the correct solution
[02:16:19] <fattest> cork: what about my airport id?
[02:16:28] <fattest> cork: oh its there
[02:16:30] <Cork> fattest: it should be in body where you want it
[02:17:21] <NoWired> getbbox don't work me, this function gets the coords of the element (the complete map), but I need to get different coords of the map ...., shit :S
[02:18:05] <Cork> NoWired: you mean a point in the path?
[02:18:17] <Cork> NoWired: have you checked http://raphaeljs.com/reference.html ?
[02:19:12] <fattest> cork: the text isn't showing up. here is my website http://lolplanet.net and here is my source code for index.php http://pastebin.com/p0p8DSme
[02:20:07] <Cork> fattest: i get a 404 on that link
[02:20:14] <fattest> cork: hold on
[02:20:23] <fattest> cork: refresh the page
[02:20:44] <NoWired> I try to explain well, I have a spanish map (in svg, only one "path", in "raphael" only one path too), I need create differents coords (paths) on the default image, to can show it with different colors (for example), I'm trying to see the raphaels doc, but I don't find how can I get the path to can do it
[02:21:02] <fattest> i pasted the div under LoL news and contents will go here!
[02:22:07] <Cork> NoWired: you could use the get from x,y or you could loop over the points and see where its at
[02:22:19] <Cork> NoWired: you could also grab a matrix of all the positions in the path
[02:22:31] <fattest> cork: do u know what i did wrong?
[02:22:43] <Cork> haven't looked yet
[02:24:27] <Cork> wait...
[02:24:36] <Cork> how many times are you including jquery on that page?
[02:25:05] <Cork> uh...
[02:25:19] <Cork> fattest: your including jquery of different versions 7 times on that page
[02:25:31] <Cork> and you never call noConflict or anything
[02:25:37] <Cork> that won't work
[02:25:45] <fattest> cork: the scripts arn't working if i don't uplooad seperate jquery
[02:25:52] <Cork> the airport plugin is lost as the jquery object is overwritten
[02:26:03] <fattest> cork: i tried using the latest version of jquery other stuff (like the tabs) don't work.
[02:26:09] <Cork> fattest: and it won't work the way you do it either
[02:26:20] <fattest> cork: what do you recommend?
[02:26:40] <Cork> you need to clean up that page, and only use one version of jquery
[02:27:15] <fattest> cork: i tried using only one version. but other scripts stopped working.
[02:27:17] <Cork> pick a version that all your plugins can live with
[02:27:22] <Cork> and then use that
[02:27:39] <Cork> fattest: so see what versions they all can live with
[02:27:49] <fattest> cork: where are the available versions?
[02:27:54] <Cork> your loading everything from 1.9 to 1.3.3 to 1.8 and what not
[02:28:08] <fattest> is that why my airport isn't working?
[02:28:09] <brantje> O_o
[02:28:14] <Cork> fattest: you need to check what versions the plugins are compatible with
[02:28:19] * brantje just had a nightmare...
[02:28:21] <Cork> not what versions there are
[02:28:22] <fattest> oik
[02:28:25] <brantje> Saw a source
[02:28:34] <brantje> with 7 times jquery included in it
[02:28:37] <brantje> :o
[02:28:54] <brantje> Was almost like an autobot O_o
[02:29:09] <Cork> fattest: also run w3c validator on the page
[02:29:12] <Cork> your html is broken
[02:29:31] <fattest> cork: ok
[02:30:08] <fattest> cork: how is it broken?
[02:30:41] <brantje> MIssing </p> or </b> or </div>
[02:30:46] <brantje> can be anything
[02:30:54] <Cork> fattest: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Flolplanet.net&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[02:30:59] <Cork> Result: 	69 Errors, 1 warning(s)
[02:31:03] <brantje> O_O
[02:31:04] <Trisox> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/6520635_460s_v1.jpg hahahahaha
[02:31:19] <brantje> Hahaha Trisox
[02:31:20] <brantje> +1
[02:31:26] <Cork> fattest: also your doctype is broken
[02:31:32] <fattest> cork: my what?
[02:31:35] <Cork> your doctype is xhtml, but your sending html
[02:31:42] <Cork> so the doctype is invalid
[02:31:46] <fattest> cork: im soo dumb at this
[02:31:50] <Cork> replace it with  <!doctype html>
[02:31:58] <vedic> How to put indentation if an array is very large. I have an array with 100 string values. How to make is fit with 80 column margin?
[02:32:14] <fattest> should i change <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en"> to <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html" lang="en">
[02:32:30] <Cork> FatherJack: remove the xmlns
[02:32:33] <Cork> http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Flolplanet.net%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=HTML5&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.3
[02:32:39] <Cork> 6 errors if you use html doctype
[02:32:43] <Cork> :)
[02:32:46] <fattest> ooh!
[02:32:49] <Cork> quite an improvement :)
[02:32:56] <Trisox> :D
[02:33:07] <fattest> how do i remove xmls
[02:33:19] <Cork> fattest: uh... edit the html and remove it
[02:33:38] <Cork> unless your using a framework, and then... it might be harder
[02:33:41] <fattest> <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en">
[02:33:49] <Cork> but that doctype need to go
[02:34:17] <Cork> that should be => <!doctype html> <html lang="en">
[02:34:41] <fattest> <!doctype html> <html lang="en">?
[02:34:44] <fattest> is that better?>
[02:34:46] <brantje> fattest
[02:34:53] <brantje> Do you have any experience?
[02:34:58] <brantje> In developing websites?
[02:34:58] <qdest> Anyone able to take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/1/ ?
[02:35:02] <fattest> im trying my best
[02:35:05] <fattest> im in year 11
[02:35:51] <brantje> qdest
[02:35:55] <brantje> whats the problem
[02:36:19] <Cork> fattest: i hart full suggestion, start with learning how you write a valid html page; from there look at how you make javascript and jquery work
[02:36:48] <Cork> fattest: if you don't have the basics of how an html page have to look like, it will be REALLY hard to make js behave understandable
[02:36:49] <brantje> What cork said
[02:36:57] <qdest> brantje: 2 issues, the "filters" should add up, so if I select "Event" and "Kampanj" it should contain 2 values. If I deselect event, it should only contain "Kampanj".
[02:36:59] <brantje> Loan a book from the library
[02:37:14] <Cork> or use operas get started
[02:37:15] <fattest> stop picking on me!
[02:37:22] <brantje> Its not picking on you
[02:37:40] <brantje> Its giving advice in stead of  giving you code
[02:37:45] <qdest> That's legit advice
[02:37:52] <brantje> Indeed
[02:37:52] <Cork> fattest: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/
[02:38:04] <brantje> Since jquery used html, and i
[02:38:10] <brantje> also started with a book
[02:38:14] <brantje> Not with jquery
[02:38:23] <brantje> Hence in my time there wasn't jquery
[02:38:56] <brantje> document.elementByID('id').innerHTML = 'w00t'
[02:39:00] <brantje> The old way
[02:39:09] <Cork> brantje: hell no
[02:39:10] <qdest> brantje: could you take a quick look at the fiddle? I'm really confused what's going on
[02:39:25] <Cork> its document.write('w00t') THATS the old way ^^'
[02:39:40] <brantje> That too yea
[02:39:50] <brantje> Ending up with a white white
[02:39:56] <brantje> with only w00t on it
[02:39:56] <NoWired> well, I can see that to "convert" the map coords to something that "raphaeljs" can use, just only add "M" at the begin and "Z" at the end .....
[02:39:57] <brantje> :p
[02:40:01] <Cork> innerHTML thats rocket science compared :)
[02:40:10] <brantje> Yea :P
[02:40:31] <Cork> brantje: at the beginning there wasn't any dom
[02:40:40] <brantje> Just dust
[02:40:49] <Cork> just text and tables :)
[02:41:14] <Cork> ugg this gives me shivers remembering it...
[02:41:21] <brantje> Remember we talked about the % of alcohol in the bloood
[02:41:36] <brantje> I may test it from my boss
[02:42:19] <brantje> The Ballmer peak
[02:42:28] <Cork> ya
[02:42:31] <brantje> Only in my own time throuh :P
[02:42:36] <Cork> but you know whats the leet percent right?
[02:42:44] <Cork> 0.1337
[02:42:45] <brantje> 0.1337 right?
[02:42:49] <Cork> get the drift...
[02:42:57] <brantje> drift?
[02:43:01] <Cork> its a joke...
[02:43:10] <Cork> LEET
[02:43:10] <brantje> ahh
[02:43:23] <brantje> Its wroth trying
[02:43:27] <Cork> lol
[02:44:56] <brantje> Back to code
[02:45:38] <brantje> Quits: fattest >> Shall he go the library :P?
[02:47:49] <qdest> http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/2/ <-- when "deselecting" items they won't clear from the array, and I'd also like to know how to remove "all" if anything other than "all" is selected. Could someone help me out?
[02:51:30] <qdest> cork? :P
[02:52:01] <Cork> qdest: sorry i don't have time right now
[02:52:56] <qdest> no worries, I'll try back in a few :)
[02:54:33] <DukeDrake> hmmmm
[02:54:49] <lad> cork: can u tell me the lines that im using jquery library/
[02:55:34] <Cork> what lines?
[02:55:35] <DukeDrake> is it possible to disable a hover action until one hover over an element AGAIN? ... currently I change the class of the hovered element, and it immediately executes the linked actions :/
[02:56:05] <lad> cork: nvm i found it.
[02:56:14] <lad> cork: where do i add my only jquery?
[02:57:11] <lad> cork: under head?
[02:57:39] <Cork> lad sorry i don't have time to teach you the basics
[02:58:13] <lad> cork: aw ok
[02:58:55] <brantje> lad: http://spyrestudios.com/simple-guide-how-to-get-started-with-jquery/
[02:59:35] <lad> brantje: ok reading now
[03:00:03] <Cork> man i hate ie...
[03:00:23] <Cork> i'm setting a width on a div, and ie8 just ignores me...
[03:00:28] <grafi> i feel you Cork ;)
[03:01:04] <brantje> And thats why i don't make my site compatible with ie
[03:01:16] <brantje> Feels like developing a whole new on
[03:01:18] <brantje> e
[03:01:20] <Cork> $('#page').css('width') => "1370px"
[03:01:22] <Cork> $('#page').css('width', '1000px')
[03:01:24] <Cork> $('#page').css('width') => "1370px"
[03:01:32] <Cork> %@%#¤¤"#¤€@£€"#%¤!!!!
[03:01:36] <brantje> i use > $('#page').css('width', '1000px')
[03:01:45] <eWer> IE is very important! too many people still use it
[03:01:49] <eWer> like it or not
[03:01:54] <Cork> ya
[03:02:09] <Cork> its just so damn broken
[03:02:37] <eWer> i hope google buys microsoft and kills IE :)
[03:02:43] <brantje> Yea:P
[03:02:49] <Cork> eWer: good luck with that
[03:03:00] <eWer> Dreaming..
[03:03:01] <eWer> :)
[03:03:11] <Cork> wonder if you could use one of the java exploits to install chrometab?
[03:03:17] <grafi> xD
[03:03:20] <Cork> sorry chromeframe
[03:03:27] <brantje> ok site with 144.141 Visits
[03:03:33] <brantje> 45.75 Chrome
[03:03:37] <brantje> 29.5 Firefox
[03:03:42] <brantje> 12.8 Safari
[03:03:46] <brantje> 7.5 IE
[03:03:54] <brantje> 2.31 In Operable
[03:04:01] <Cork> brantje: your quite lucky actually
[03:04:09] <brantje> =D
[03:04:16] <eWer> its quite common if the most people visiting are devs
[03:04:51] <brantje> use it
[03:04:51] <brantje> [12:01:47] <eWer> like it or not
[03:04:54] <brantje> whoops
[03:04:57] <brantje> http://awesomescreenshot.com/06dwe5l74
[03:05:07] <Cork> ya, and if most are server admins its closer to 60% ie 25% firefox and 15% chrome
[03:05:26] <Cork> (firefox is still default on RHEL and ie for windows servers)
[03:05:42] <brantje> i have an windows server
[03:05:46] <brantje> but with chrome :x
[03:06:07] <Cork> brantje: most server rules don't allow browsers that isn't the default
[03:06:10] <eWer> not admins particular, but people who know that IE sucks and stays the hell out of it, and these people know thing or two about it. Many moms and dads use IE cause they dont know any better
[03:06:39] <brantje> My dad and mom are using chrome
[03:06:46] <Cork> company rules is one other BIG sections
[03:06:53] <brantje> dad installed it self
[03:06:56] <Cork> many MANY companies only allow specific browsers
[03:07:02] <brantje> True
[03:07:05] <elephphant> Hi, I am trying to write a catch all to add "touchend" events to elements with onclick events to fix ipad users. The binding does not seem to add the function though. http://pastebin.com/zGfZ1pzL
[03:07:09] <brantje> At my school they force IE
[03:07:18] <brantje> lucky me, i have chrome portable
[03:07:28] <Cork> and often its even a specific version >_>
[03:07:34] <brantje> And since i can execute files from usb (WTF SYST ADMIN???)
[03:07:45] <brantje> i can run chrome
[03:07:49] <eWer> If noone likes it, u have to forcefeed it to ppl
[03:07:49] <Cork> brantje: let me guess cause of activex?
[03:07:56] <brantje> Donnow
[03:08:07] <brantje> They use win 2k8 atthe server
[03:08:13] <brantje> win 7 at client pc's
[03:08:26] <brantje> Already nuked the schoolnetwork once :')
[03:09:10] <brantje> Its very funny to put up multiple DHCP servers :P
[03:09:26] <brantje> And then catch the Facebook/twitter requests :p
[03:09:35] <eWer> ohhhh
[03:09:45] <eWer> we gotta badass ovah here
[03:09:45] <brantje> did it once, to prove their security was wrong
[03:09:57] <brantje> They said they would look at it
[03:10:19] <brantje> Don't suprise me if its still possible :x
[03:10:23] <eWer> did it once, to prove their security was wrong, end up being cuffed and taken to jail
[03:10:25] <eWer> ^^
[03:10:43] <grafi> yeah
[03:10:45] <brantje> in that time i was doing an IT study there
[03:10:55] <brantje> So, i said it was part of my 'study'
[03:11:15] <brantje> Just wanted to check how network was secured
[03:11:20] <brantje> I was shocked
[03:11:49] <brantje> First with aircrack, i cracked the teachers wifi, within 3 hours
[03:12:06] <brantje> then i had access to the server of the teachers
[03:12:16] <brantje> serperate vlans :x
[03:12:37] <eWer> u studied IT there, yet u owned them noobs
[03:13:05] <brantje> i did a lot of 'black it' study my self
[03:13:18] <brantje> and they were my poc ;)
[03:13:27] <eWer> *evil laugh*
[03:13:44] <DukeDrake> hi
[03:13:47] <brantje> Hi
[03:14:01] <DukeDrake> I got a bit confused with jquery syntax, I'm afraid
[03:14:16] <brantje> SHoot
[03:14:30] <eWer> im studying IT too, the only downside is that i will have to learn C++
[03:14:32] <DukeDrake> I'd like to remove all elements (identified by class) without a certain subelement (also class)
[03:14:40] <eWer> id prefer web or java
[03:14:42] <DukeDrake> $('.consider').children('.needle').remove();
[03:14:59] <Aprendiz1234_> hi all, I have a problem that getting me crazy, onSelect event in datepicker
[03:15:02] <brantje> Thats the way you remove the childeren
[03:15:06] <brantje> if i'm right
[03:15:07] <DukeDrake> ^^ seems wrong ^^
[03:15:14] <DukeDrake> ah
[03:15:22] <DukeDrake> *durrrrrr*
[03:15:24] <brantje> eWer i prefer php or javascript
[03:15:27] <Aprendiz1234_> http://pastebin.com/4tBMsY9b
[03:15:40] <DukeDrake> I'd use each, probably ...
[03:15:44] <DukeDrake> *should
[03:15:45] <brantje> Aprendiz1234_
[03:15:52] <brantje> i used yesterday an datetime picker
[03:16:00] <brantje> let me look
[03:16:01] <Aprendiz1234_> the sintaxis looks like correct, but I don't know what is the problem :(
[03:16:40] <brantje> Hmmm
[03:16:46] <brantje> same code as me
[03:17:34] <brantje> Aprendiz1234_ http://pastebin.com/Zywux1TB
[03:17:38] <brantje> thats what i have
[03:18:21] <Aprendiz1234_> and firebug gives me no errors
[03:18:29] <Aprendiz1234_> I don't know how to debug
[03:18:36] <brantje> Had it too
[03:18:37] <DukeDrake> $('.consider').each(function() { if($(this).children('.needle').length < 1) $(this).remove(); }); ...... still wrong somehow :/
[03:18:48] <brantje> DukeDrake
[03:19:02] <brantje> Maybe this is an idea
[03:19:10] <brantje> 1) Get content of childeren
[03:19:15] <DukeDrake> ah, found the error ....
[03:19:16] <brantje> 2) Save it
[03:19:24] <brantje> 3) remove the parents
[03:19:36] <brantje> 4) restore saved childeren
[03:20:20] <DukeDrake> ^^
[03:20:30] <DukeDrake> thanx anyway
[03:24:55] <ArcaneWater> Hello.
[03:26:37] <brantje> btw
[03:26:43] <brantje> Does someone knows a good editor
[03:26:55] <brantje> That can remember the variables you typed?
[03:27:02] <brantje> Notepad++ doesn't do that
[03:27:05] <dblosevn> notepad++ for windows
[03:27:11] <dblosevn> ya it does
[03:27:15] <brantje> O_o
[03:27:19] <dblosevn> ctrl enter
[03:27:32] <Kingsy> if an element is created by jquery, how do you test to see if the element has been created?   $('#element').length == 0    always says that the element does not exist. Is this because its still using the original page source? so it cant see newly rendered elements?
[03:27:49] <brantje> dblosevn, not my own functions  / var
[03:27:53] <dblosevn> ctrl <space> for code completion ctrl <enter> for variable completion
[03:28:27] <discorpia> Kingsy: it should be able to see it immediately
[03:28:30] <alexut> i'm working with isotope plugin and have some problems calculating a containers height, if anyone with jquery knowledge might give a hand i'd apreciate : http://jsfiddle.net/2Nyx9/3/
[03:29:18] <Kingsy> discorpia: hrm, well that condition always returns false.
[03:29:24] <Kingsy> discorpia: can you think of a reason why ?
[03:29:27] <dblosevn> i dont really like heavy ides, i use notepad++ for 90% of everything zen studio is pretty nice but not free and pretty heavy
[03:29:49] <brantje> zen studio?
[03:30:08] <discorpia> Kingsy: hmm, not really. how are you adding the element?
[03:30:24] <discorpia> Kingsy: maybe you are using append() instead of appendAfter() or vice versa
[03:30:27] <dblosevn> brantje: yes notepad++ will complete your own vars and function names if you start typing them and press ctrl enter i do it hundreds of times a day
[03:30:34] <fairuz> brantje: I use sublime. I found it's lightweight
[03:30:38] <brantje> Ah zend studio
[03:30:44] <discorpia> Kingsy: if you try to write it manually in the browser console, does it work then?
[03:31:13] <brantje> dblosevn, now enable by defaukt
[03:31:17] * brantje is lazy
[03:31:31] <dblosevn> you could probally write a plugin lol
[03:31:44] <dblosevn> ctrl enter always works lol nothing to enable
[03:32:06] <Kingsy> discorpia: no it the result is "0"
[03:32:06] <discorpia> Kingsy: http://pastebin.com/Nv7ahBdn   works for me in the console
[03:32:10] <brantje> thanks for the zend studio :)
[03:32:22] <Kingsy> hrm
[03:32:44] <discorpia> Kingsy: i would start by looking at the code that adds the new element, maybe it tries to attach it to the wrong node and can't find it
[03:33:02] <Kingsy> hrm, I can see it in Firebug. damn
[03:33:05] <discorpia> Kingsy: if you do "inspect element" (assuming chrome/firebug) you should be able to see the newly created element in the dom
[03:33:09] <discorpia> ah
[03:36:17] <Kingsy> discorpia: yep, console.log($(".mousetrap")); <-- doesnt find the element at all.
[03:36:50] <discorpia> Kingsy: what does the html of the element look like? the entire tag
[03:37:05] <discorpia> the tag that it's supposed to find that it
[03:37:06] <discorpia> is*
[03:37:57] <Kingsy> discorpia: <div class="mousetrap" style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255, 255, 255); opacity: 0; z-index: 99; position: absolute; width: 400px; height: 218px; left: 0px; top: 0px; cursor: move;"></div>
[03:39:43] <discorpia> Kingsy: hmm.. that's very strange, what if you do $('div'), is it included in that list?
[03:40:41] <Kingsy> so check to see if "div" exists?
[03:42:16] <Kingsy> discorpia: it returns ALOT of divs, .mousetrap is not in the list.
[03:42:41] <discorpia> Kingsy: hmm, you're not doing things in an iframe or something like that?
[03:42:47] <Kingsy> nope
[03:42:57] <Kingsy> this is certainly weird.
[03:43:47] <discorpia> hmm, other than making sure $ is really the jquery version one expects i'm not sure how to debug this. try adding the same div as static html as well
[03:44:08] <Kingsy> discorpia: np, thanks for the help.
[03:44:23] <discorpia> so before you add it live the length should be 1 and after the length should be 2, just to see if the classname or similar is causing problems maybe, but i'm just blindly guessing
[04:10:08] <ex00> Hi I have problem with evaluating function in org-capture-templates. One of entry in this variable is:  ("d" "Work Todo" entry (file+olp "~/org/work/todo.org" current-date)
[04:10:09] <ex00>          "* TODO %?\t:5353:\n"). Function current date (defun current-date () (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d")). This unfortunately doesn't work and I have error "Wrong type argument: stringp, current-date"
[04:14:02] <Qdest> http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/2/ <-- anyone able to help out? "Deselecting" isn't really working as intended and I need to know how to remove "all" from the array if something else is selected. Help appreciated! :)
[04:14:13] <ex00> I've tried running it with 'current-date too.
[04:16:25] <ex00> uuups sorry not this group
[04:17:41] <mvta> morning mates
[04:17:52] <mvta> is anybody in the room?
[04:19:32] <mvta> I have a problem with the last jquery-ui. Before I did $('#mydiv').data('slider')._trigger('change') but now console logs an error. Does anybody know something about that?
[04:25:02] <Trisox> mvta: make a jsfiddle a little demo always helps
[04:26:15] <mvta> Ok Trisox. one sec
[04:29:06] <Trisox> sure
[04:31:52] <Qdest> http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/3/ <-- still stuck, trying to figure out why "deselecting" an item won't work and how to remove 'all' when others are selected. Help appreciated!
[04:35:39] <mvta> Trisox, doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/FGjAJ/
[04:36:43] <Trisox> what is quantity ?
[04:36:46] <Trisox> a variable?
[04:36:59] <Hermiene> Is there a function in jQuery for fishing out GET variables?
[04:38:52] <mvta> okey
[04:38:53] <Trisox> Qdest
[04:38:53] <mvta> sorry
[04:38:55] <mvta> jjajajaja
[04:38:55] <Trisox> oh
[04:39:02] <mvta> well
[04:39:08] <Qdest> Trisox: Yes?
[04:39:13] <Trisox> sorry ment mvta
[04:39:17] <Qdest> damn :p
[04:39:21] <Trisox> look later
[04:39:43] <mvta> shit, works fine
[04:39:49] <topriddy1> i have an issue where javascript on client is returning a date before current date.
[04:39:51] <mvta> but not in my machine...
[04:40:47] <Trisox> mvta: what do you try to get ?
[04:40:55] <mvta> one sec
[04:41:03] <mvta> my works mate are talking
[04:41:22] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/FGjAJ/1/
[04:41:25] <Trisox> like that?
[04:42:40] <Tam_> if i have var inputs = $('form:input'); how do i set the value of the status field of the form assigned to the var inputs, assuming i cant do it in the html before declaring inputs
[04:42:48] <Trisox> ok
[04:43:38] <Trisox> var inputvalue = 'test'; $('input').val(inputvalue);
[04:43:40] <Trisox> ?
[04:43:44] <Trisox> ?val
[04:43:53] <Trisox> bot is down
[04:44:38] <Tam_> no thats editing the html, i want to edit on the object
[04:45:30] <mvta> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method '_change' of undefined
[04:47:17] <Qdest> Tam_: set a data-status="value"?
[04:47:36] <lejocely> hi
[04:47:39] <Tam_> Qdest, i need to edit the object, not the hmtl
[04:47:41] <Tam_> html*
[04:48:20] <lejocely> I've got a problem with Jquery-ui, for now, I just try to get when one of the handle of the slider is on zero
[04:48:46] <Trisox> mvta: in my example?
[04:49:08] <lejocely> here is the small bit of codehttp://pastebin.com/W5M1SkMy
[04:49:15] <lejocely> oups http://pastebin.com/W5M1SkMy
[04:49:34] <lejocely> this bit doesn't work : if($( "#amount" ).val(ui.values[ 0 ]) == 0){alert("ok");}
[04:50:07] <lejocely> in the end, what I want to do is to change the step value when the slide's value is under 0
[04:57:42] <rabbi1> i got an <a> tag with attribute disabled=disabled . how can i add a class to parent element of <a> if it's attribute is disabled=disabled ?
[04:57:48] <Qdest> http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/4/ <-- why isn't "deselecting" items working? You have to press it twice to take effect and then, theoretically, it should be selected again..
[04:58:28] <Qdest> rabbi1: $('a[disabled=disabled]').parent().addClass('myClass'); maybe, dunno if it works :p
[05:00:32] <rabbi1> says the it has no method parent
[05:01:49] <Cork> rabbi1: $('a[disabled]').each(function() { $(this).parent().addClass('myClass'); }); is prob what you want to do
[05:01:51] <Qdest> rabbi1: well, you could try :disabled selector as well, I guess.. but, <a> doesn't support disabled="disabled" afaik? $('a:disabled').parent().addClass('myClass'); perhaps.. but, I don't believe it validates
[05:02:03] <Qdest> oh, what cork said >_<
[05:02:08] <Cork> :)
[05:02:26] <Cork> Qdest: your code should work too
[05:02:29] <Cork> but only for one a tag
[05:02:53] <Cork> and the value check is not needed, as the name is ehough
[05:02:55] <Cork> *enough
[05:03:00] <Qdest> Ah, true :) Any chance you could take a look at my fiddle cork? I'm really stuck, facepalmed 10 times already :P
[05:03:50] <Cork> why are you running $('.all-projects').hasClass('active') at all?
[05:03:59] <Cork> just do $('.all-projects').removeClass('active'); all the times
[05:04:18] <Cork> else you first do a selection for the element, then check if any of them has the class
[05:04:27] <Cork> then do a new selection, and removes it from those that has it
[05:04:41] <Qdest> ah yes that's true, the if isn't needed at all
[05:04:42] <Cork> or even better; do $('.all-projects.active').removeClass('active');
[05:04:56] <Qdest> ah, will do. thanks, but it's the "array" stuff that's really bugging me
[05:05:05] <Cork> ya, i'm looking :)
[05:05:31] <Cork> checkables could ust use toggleClass
[05:06:01] <Cork> wait...
[05:06:09] <Cork> filterables won't work
[05:06:22] <Cork> you will run $('active') not $('.active')
[05:06:25] <philhutchinson> rabbi1: $("a").each(function (i, obj) { if ($(this).attr('disabled')) { $(this).addClass('myClass'); } })
[05:06:57] <Cork> philhutchinson: that will loop all a tags on the page...
[05:07:23] <philhutchinson> yes...
[05:07:23] <discorpia> Qdest: hmm, it couldn't be related to class names being in a different order when you splice your string?
[05:07:26] <crashev> hello, I'm doing ajax put call, it returns json data as: {"message":"Training with that name already exists in our database","status":1,"errorCode":-104} ,why do I also get uncaught exception: Respose error and no message given ?
[05:07:35] <philhutchinson> he said he wanted to check for disabled and then add a class
[05:07:35] <rabbi1> Cork: thanks ...!
[05:07:43] <discorpia> Qdest: so you inadvertently remove parts of the string
[05:07:53] <Cork> philhutchinson: while a[disabled] is a native query, so it will run fast
[05:08:06] <Qdest> Cork: basically what I'm trying to do is "fetch all classes of the item". Append these to the filter array if the item is selected. If it's not, remove from the filters array. Going to try to implement this to the quicksand plugin. As it is today, it can only take 1 choice, but I want multiple selections. So I'm trying to store them in filters to then later on use filters to select stuff that has classes of the filters.. So to speak
[05:08:09] <Cork> well comparably fast
[05:08:49] <philhutchinson> fair enough
[05:08:56] <Qdest> discorpia: good question, it should treat them as values in an array though
[05:09:02] <Cork> Qdest: $('.' + filterClasses.join(', .'))
[05:09:13] <discorpia> Qdest: hmm yeah, maybe i'm reading it wrong. i would probably just have put an if inside the each() checking for those three and doing a continue if encountered
[05:10:04] <Qdest> Cork: that would select all "classes" in the filterClasses?
[05:10:18] <Cork> all elements that has one of the classes yes
[05:10:38] <Qdest> aye that's not really what I'm after just yet, that comes to the filter thing, and it's the filter thing that isn't working
[05:10:42] <Cork> you can't select a class, so i guess thats what you mean
[05:10:46] <Qdest> the "current" filters should be the selected items
[05:11:00] <Cork> Qdest: and this section $filterClasses.splice(filterClasses.indexOf('cat-item'), 1);
[05:11:06] <Cork> doesn't really make sense at all
[05:11:19] <Cork> there is no relation between those two
[05:11:22] <Qdest> Cork: it's just to remove the "invalid" categories
[05:11:34] <Cork> that won't do that
[05:11:39] <Qdest> it does though
[05:11:46] <Ov3rTaf> hi
[05:11:54] <Sven_vB> hi :)
[05:11:54] <Cork> well yam cause var $filterClasses = $(filterClasses); is broken too
[05:12:00] <Cork> *well ya,
[05:12:30] <Sven_vB> is there a way to also preview tables in the jQuery UI ThemeRoller?
[05:13:16] <Francis47> http://jsfiddle.net/tCguD/ - i need to append <em>&bull</em> to <div id="bullets"></div> for each li counted - can someone help me do that?
[05:15:09] <Qdest> Cork: I'm sure I could redo this in a much easier approach, basically the classes of each <li> is unknown, what I do know is that entypo, active and cat-item isn't needed. Then I simply want to "gather" all elements (not in the fiddle yet) that has these selected classes. So the "menu" is just a way to select elements to send to quicksand plugin
[05:15:32] <chris_> Can a failed ajax call cause IE7/IE8 to display a 'connection problems' page?
[05:16:34] <discorpia> chris_: if the ajax fails with a server error, i.e. status 500, it might
[05:16:55] <discorpia> chris_: or, well, it shouldn't affect the page making the call
[05:17:32] <Cork> filterClasses = split(' '); filterClasses.splice(filterClasses.indexOf('active'), 1); filterClasses.splice(filterClasses.indexOf('cat-item'), 1); $filterClasses = $('.' + filterClasses.join(', .'));
[05:17:33] <koskoz> Anticom2: liScroll is buggy :/
[05:17:36] <Cork> Qdest: ^
[05:17:42] <Cork> Qdest: that should do that for you
[05:17:47] <koskoz> if the content of a li is too wide it create a new line
[05:18:16] <lejocely> Sorry, I just began with jquery and jquery ui
[05:18:19] <chris_> ok thanks. Well something is causing our IE clients to suddely see a 'connection problems' page.  We can't reproduce it.  It's hard to imagine how this could be caused.
[05:18:23] <lejocely> is there a problem with : if($( "#amount" ).val( ui.values[ 0 ]) == 0){alert('test');} ?
[05:19:14] <discorpia> lejocely: what do you want to do?
[05:20:08] <lejocely> discorpia:  the whole snipet : http://pastebin.com/Jtpu20Z7
[05:20:39] <discorpia> lejocely: in that case you are setting the value of #amount (which i assume is an input?) to the value of ui.values[0] and checking if that returns 0, but val() returns the object when setting a value
[05:20:58] <lejocely> discorpia: I want to do a double slider which, when the user changes the value under 0, the step changes to 1000
[05:21:39] <lejocely> discorpia: yes it's an input
[05:21:49] <discorpia> lejocely: hmm, i think maybe you want just  if (ui.values[0] == 0)
[05:22:45] <c00kiemon5ter> Francis47, http://jsfiddle.net/tCguD/1/
[05:22:59] <lejocely> ok, I understand now a bit better
[05:23:00] <lejocely> how to just check the value then ?
[05:24:07] <lejocely> discorpia: but it's gonna just check all the ui stuff, no ?
[05:24:24] <Myx0x3> ive got an gallery, and i want to move div (lets call it X) to the end inside an div , so i use appendTo, but the X does not move whats inside it :S
[05:24:39] <Francis47> c00kiemon5ter: Thanks man :)
[05:25:09] <marcules> I <3 .unbind()
[05:25:43] <lejocely> discorpia: thanks, it works better :)
[05:26:29] <Qdest> Cork: no chance you could update the fiddle with that split and splice stuff? Removed everything else basically but it doesn't want to use split like that
[05:28:03] <Qdest> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/5/ <-- that's what I've got atm
[05:28:51] <Cork> Qdest: http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/6/
[05:28:54] <Cork> something like that
[05:28:55] <Qdest> So if I select app and dr both will be in the "scope" and usable? Also, deselecting doesn't fully work, unknown expression .
[05:28:58] <Qdest> oh
[05:29:33] <Cork> (untested)
[05:29:35] <iaj> when I enter something like '$('#check_uid2450_0').prop('checked', 'checked');' into the console for a certain checkbox.. what should I get as a response?
[05:29:56] <Qdest> Cork right well still the "." doesn't want to work. I'm not entirely following your thought here but I sense it's close :D
[05:29:57] <Cork> iaj: prop doesn't take 'checked'
[05:30:10] <Cork> iaj: thats for attr
[05:30:22] <Cork> iaj: you want prop('checked', true)
[05:31:00] <Cork> js> "active entypo cat-item".split(' ')
[05:31:03] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:31:03] <iaj> Hmm that should give me something like true or false?  I basically want to stop the submission of a form if its not checked.
[05:31:06] <iaj> @ Cork
[05:31:23] <Cork> js> print("active entypo cat-item".split(' '))
[05:31:26] <b-ot> Cork: active,entypo,cat-item
[05:31:30] <Cork> js> print('.' + "active entypo cat-item".split(' ').join(', .'))
[05:31:33] <b-ot> Cork: .active, .entypo, .cat-item
[05:31:48] <Cork> Qdest: if you want to make a selector of them, that is what you need to do
[05:32:13] <Qdest> Cork: That part I get, with the .join etc
[05:32:21] <Cork> iaj: then if($(elm).prop('checked'))
[05:32:36] <Qdest> The part I don't understand is that if I select more than 1, e.g. "App" and then also "DR", I want to catch .app and .dr
[05:32:50] <Qdest> if I deselect DR, only .app should remain, unless I hit "all" and it should clear > set .all-projects etc
[05:33:07] <iaj> Cork: And if I want to negate this I do if (!($(elm...) ) ?
[05:33:15] <Qdest> if you get the idea, but.. I'm not entirely sure how since it's the stuff within the .each() that doesn't want to work (and now, something expression .)
[05:33:20] <Cork> iaj: if(!$(elm).prop('checked'))
[05:34:24] <Cork> Qdest: not sure how your planing to do that with currentItem
[05:34:34] <Cork> Qdest: you need to store all selected options
[05:34:51] <Cork> so currentItem isn't really of interest
[05:34:53] <Qdest> Yeah, which "kinda" works from the example but "deselecting" them doesn't.
[05:36:05] <Qdest> Cork: saving them "outside" is what I'm trying to use filter for
[05:36:06] <Cork> Qdest: first i would recommend putting the classes you want to select on in a data-target attribute or something intest
[05:36:09] <Cork> makes it cleaner
[05:36:53] <Qdest> Cork: aye, it will be like that later on, but for now it's classes and it's set up that way from the.. well, I'll make it cleaner but the "functionality" of using <li><a> as "menu items" allowing multiple selections saved to a "filter" used later to catch those elements
[05:37:01] <Cork> Qdest: then you can do $.map($('.filter-list .active'), function(elm) { return $(elm).data('classes'); }).join(' ').split(' ')
[05:37:12] <Cork> (picked data-classes instead of data-target)
[05:37:24] <Cork> hmm
[05:37:40] <Cork> actually it might be nice to be able to have class combinations
[05:37:49] <Qdest> oh so I use the '.active' to set the current filters?
[05:37:51] <mvta> hi again
[05:38:11] <Cork> Qdest: so  $.map($('.filter-list .active'), function(elm) { return $(elm).data('classes').split(' ').join('.');; })
[05:38:16] <Cork> Qdest: yes
[05:38:25] <Cork> that would be what i would do ^
[05:38:37] <Cork> and a .join(', ')
[05:38:42] <iaj> Cork: thans, Got it :)
[05:38:43] <Cork> if you want to make it into a selector
[05:39:08] <Qdest> Cork I get it, but how would I ignore e.g. cat-item and entypo which aren't "legit" categories, they're just classes that needs to be present but not used as a filter?
[05:39:09] <Cork> opps
[05:39:17] <Cork> Qdest: $(elm).data('classes').split(' ').join('.') should be '.' + $(elm).data('classes').split(' ').join('.')
[05:39:35] <Cork> Qdest: by not using the class
[05:39:44] <Cork> just save what you want in a separate element
[05:39:47] <Cork> *attribute
[05:40:20] <Cork> Qdest: <li class="active cat-item entypo" data-classes="other classes this should match">
[05:40:59] <Cork> "other classes this should match" wi be converted to ".other.classes.this.should.match" in the loop up there
[05:41:22] <Cork> that should make for a quite solid selector solution
[05:42:22] <Myx0x3> why does not appendTo move whole div and containing divs? it only moves the selected element, not the underlying elements? :S
[05:42:29] <Myx0x3> and not*
[05:42:46] <Cork> Myx0x3: it does
[05:42:50] <Myx0x3> Cork: not for me?
[05:42:58] <Cork> unless the selection contains the children too
[05:43:01] <Qdest> Cork: thanks, I get the picture. Gonna fiddle some more! I'll show you when I get somewhere. Thanks a lot!
[05:43:11] <Myx0x3> Cork: yes, it contains children..
[05:43:16] <Cork> $('li').appendTo('ul') will flatten the ul for ex.
[05:43:28] <Cork> as it matches all lis, and moves them to the same up
[05:43:43] <mvta> i don't u
[05:44:00] <Cork> Myx0x3: all elements in the selection will be appended to the parent
[05:44:02] <Myx0x3> Cork: watch my code here.. http://jsfiddle.net/hRDEq/
[05:44:25] <mvta> i don't understand why this code http://jsfiddle.net/FGjAJ/3/ runs in fiddle and doesn't run in local machine: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method '_change' of undefined
[05:44:34] <Myx0x3> .statusdiv is the failing thing..
[05:44:35] <c00kiemon5ter> alright, has anyone reported the .toggle() bug on jquery 1.9.x ?
[05:45:28] <Cork> Myx0x3: hen you do appendTo you on a selector you do $('selector').append(jQuery_selection)
[05:45:53] <Cork> that means you change all the parent links of ALL the elements matched in the jQuery_selection
[05:46:02] <c00kiemon5ter> aha, found the report: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13395
[05:46:14] <Cork> it doens't check if any of them in the selection is a parent of the other
[05:46:37] <Cork> Myx0x3: that is really all that append does
[05:46:52] <Cork> (well it sets the childrenNodes variable too)
[05:46:59] <Cork> *childNodes
[05:47:21] <Myx0x3> Cork: but i use appendTo? :P
[05:47:36] <Cork> Myx0x3: thats just a short hand for finding the target
[05:47:49] <c00kiemon5ter> so, what is the recommended alternative to .toggle() ?
[05:48:10] <Cork> Myx0x3: its ~= appendTo = function(target) { $(target).append(this) }
[05:48:26] <Myx0x3> Cork: oh okay
[05:48:58] <Cork> and that is for each [this] { dom.appendNode(this); }
[05:49:07] <Cork> /* psudo code */
[05:49:26] <Cork> or was it appendChild
[05:49:45] <Cork> ah, it was
[05:49:48] <Cork> Myx0x3: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Node.appendChild
[05:50:24] <Cork> (and thats why i always have found it weird with appendTo/prependTo)
[05:50:38] <Cork> "but, but, its the wrong order!" :D
[05:53:31] <Myx0x3> im so fucking lost, well, better stard find my mind again before looseing it :P
[05:53:36] <Myx0x3> start*
[05:56:13] <Cork> Myx0x3: everything jquery does boils down to native dom calls :)
[05:56:34] <Cork> might not be of much use if your not interested, but i find it useful to know
[05:59:02] <ronjn> following problem: http://jsfiddle.net/nqUYU/
[05:59:28] <ronjn> when i click on 'details' i want only the div under it to toggle
[05:59:41] <ronjn> not every div with that class on the page
[06:00:18] <Cork> ronjn: $(this).nextAll('.text').first().slideToggle("fast");
[06:00:36] <Cork> ah wait its not following after
[06:00:59] <Cork> ronjn: $(this).closest('.title').nextAll('.text').first().slideToggle("fast");
[06:01:04] <ronjn> jeah, it works only on the top one
[06:01:17] <ronjn> great
[06:01:19] <ronjn> cheers!
[06:01:26] <Cork> btw you shouldn't use <a href="#">
[06:01:44] <ronjn> what should i use then?
[06:01:53] <Myx0x3> Cork: well, im kinda new, and i dont even know yet what DOM exactly is, lol..
[06:02:28] <Cork> ronjn: if your ok with the entire <h2> element being clickable use that with tabindex="0" and text-decoration: underline; color: blue;
[06:02:37] <Cork> ronjn: or use a span with the same settings
[06:02:53] <Cork> ronjn: its totally pointless to abuse a tags now days
[06:03:12] <Cork> it was needed for old ie5.5, but not in the browsers on the market today
[06:03:52] <ronjn> you mean it should work with    <div class="title"><h2>Details</h2></div>    alone?
[06:06:30] <Cork> ronjn: exactly
[06:06:47] <Cork> ronjn: you can click on any element, so the a tag there isn't needed
[06:07:17] <ronjn> ok, i'll try that. thanks
[06:07:36] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nqUYU/1/
[06:07:56] <Cork> you still need the closest() selector though :)
[06:11:13] <thaifood> Any selector genius' here ?  http://fpaste.org/hTZ0/
[06:12:55] <thaifood> I tried  console.log( $(event.target.id).closest("h3").attr("id") );  but no luck
[06:13:30] <Cork> thaifood: what are you trying to do?
[06:13:45] <Cork> ugg another has ling abuser T_T
[06:13:49] <Cork> *link
[06:14:01] <thaifood> i'm trying to return the id value of the <h3> above what i clicked.  http://fpaste.org/hTZ0/
[06:14:43] <Cork> $(this).closest('div').prevAll('h3').last().attr('id')
[06:15:15] <Qdest> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/7/ <-- could you take a quick look? Line 27 is the issue, as long as I only select 1 it works, how do I select "multiple" as data-type="app,dr" doesn't work
[06:15:47] <thaifood> Cork, thank you but that returns undefined
[06:16:13] <Cork> thaifood: that should be run in a click event
[06:16:34] <thaifood> it's run in my  $('#accordion').click(function(event) {
[06:16:40] <Qdest> Cork, I need filteredData to contain multiple elements with matching data-cat's :)
[06:16:40] <Cork> Qdest: do you want to select elements with both those classes or all elements eith either of them
[06:16:59] <Cork> uh...
[06:17:10] <Qdest> either, so it matches them all if they're selected
[06:17:18] <Cork> thaifood: then it depends on what element you click
[06:17:39] <thaifood> Cork, i'm clicking  <h3  id="nest1_acc_rpts_dvcs">Devices</h3>
[06:17:47] <thaifood> as my link shows  http://fpaste.org/hTZ0/
[06:18:09] <sykopomp> Hi, I'm doing $().draggable() on an <li> with a <button type=button> inside it, but if I click on the button, the element won't drag. Obviously I can stop using a button, but I'm wondering what it is that prevents it from acting like a draggable. Clicking on its siblings lets me drag the <li> just fine.
[06:18:47] <Cork> Qdest:   $filteredItems = $data.find('.projects[data-type~=' + filterClasses +']') isn't even close to what we talked about
[06:19:06] <Cork> Qdest: or do you mean that the selection at the top is actually what you try to select on?
[06:19:30] <Cork> if thats the case, i'm sorry cause then the original class idea was the correct one >_<
[06:19:31] <Qdest> Cork:  yeah, I did data-cat instead of data-classes
[06:19:46] <alexut> don't know if anyone has some experience with isotope plugin for jquery, i'm new to js, and basically i'm shooting in the dark here. Basically i need to get the height of the #container somehow dinamycally if the width/number of columns change ( in my exemple: http://jsfiddle.net/2Nyx9/8/ i've used a fixed value of 240 )
[06:19:50] <Cork> Qdest: the idea was that you should use that to select on class elements
[06:20:06] <Cork> not to use a data attribute selector instead of class selection >_<
[06:20:28] <Qdest> Cork: basically, below (1,2,3) would contain "items".. and anything that isn't selected with the menu up top would disappear with the help from quicksand. That's why I need to select everything with data-type="app,dr,whatever is in filterClasses"
[06:20:30] <Cork> but i think it was me misunderstanding what your trying to do
[06:21:05] <Qdest> Cork: it works as "intended" if I only select 1 category
[06:21:25] <Cork> Qdest: ya, cause attribute is a bad choice for doing that
[06:21:26] <Qdest> but if I select multiple ones, like.. "app" and "dr" it fails, cause it can't do data-type="app,dr"
[06:21:32] <Qdest> oh okay ;p
[06:21:38] <Cork> :/
[06:21:39] <Qdest> damn, this solution seemed to clean :D
[06:21:46] <Cork> Qdest: i though you tried to make a filter
[06:21:47] <Qdest> so*
[06:21:54] <Qdest> I am tho
[06:21:56] <Cork> and that you had a list somewhere else that this was filtering
[06:22:08] <Cork> thats why i said to do what i did >_>
[06:22:12] <Qdest> You filter the items "below" through selecting what to show up top in the "menu"
[06:22:42] <Cork> hmm so i wasn't wrong... @_@'
[06:22:53] <Cork> Qdest: the elements in the list should use real classes
[06:23:12] <Qdest> Cork: http://razorjack.net/quicksand/ <-- check that out, as it is you can either select "applications" or you can select "utilities", and then obviously you can select "all"
[06:23:19] <Cork> just the filter list should be data-cat
[06:23:25] <doolinkr> Quick question -- I'm performing AJAX POSTs to a PHP script but I'm confused on what constitutes a "failure" (a response.fail)...?
[06:23:37] <thaifood> Still no luck here with my selector.  http://fpaste.org/hTZ0/
[06:23:50] <Qdest> Cork: What I'm trying to do is to allow to select "applications" AND "utilities" with the option to "deselect" as well if you selected something.
[06:23:53] <thaifood> It seems really hard what should be easy.
[06:24:36] <Qdest> Cork: The filter list items have data-cat, the actual "portfolio items" to filter uses data-type="kampanj app dr" or data-type="kampanj" etc etc
[06:25:01] <Qdest> So I think you were right :p
[06:25:07] <Cork> Qdest: something like this was what i meant http://jsfiddle.net/jkMgj/8/
[06:26:40] <Qdest> cork ah, so the items in the portfolio need to have the categories in their class="cat1 cat2 cat3"?
[06:27:09] <thaifood> Cork, did you give up on me.  :-)  http://fpaste.org/hTZ0/
[06:27:16] <Abhijit> hi guys. how can i make turn.js to show the magazine in open state? by default it shows it in close state cover in front
[06:27:35] <Cork> Qdest: yes
[06:27:55] <doolinkr> thaifood:
[06:27:59] <doolinkr> http://jsfiddle.net/yvm7R/   -- Like that?
[06:28:07] <doolinkr> I mean, you can do whatever you want with that ID
[06:28:29] <Abhijit> nvm. found it.
[06:28:38] <Qdest> thanks a lot cork, gonna work with this :)) thanks again for clearing it up, got confused there!
[06:29:10] <thaifood> doolinkr, did you read this link http://fpaste.org/hTZ0/   I need it to not be hard coded to that div
[06:29:27] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/UdL88/ Odd one, the ajax etc all works fine, the console log successfully displays the value of the text input (a number) yet the ajax doesn't pass it to the php for sending? Is it wrong?
[06:30:34] <fRAiLtY-> The form works without AJAX
[06:31:43] <Nancy2012> how to hide iframe div on fancybox??? here is my codeâ€¦ http://jsfiddle.net/SfZLE/4/
[06:32:19] <doolinkr> fRAiLtY-: Have you tried echoing anything back to the AJAX call?
[06:32:37] <doolinkr> I had this issue earlier.
[06:32:40] <Nancy2012> i tried this way.. $('.fancybox-frame').contents().find('#mainWrap').hide(); but it wouldnt seem work
[06:33:03] <doolinkr> I sent to a test.php which just had "echo "success"; to see if it was my PHP or my jQ
[06:33:42] <doolinkr> Oh, well I suppose it might not be PHP xD

[06:38:00] <Kingsy> is it possible to list all of the event functions that have been binded to a specific element ?

[06:39:23] <doolinkr> "Display the datepicker embedded in the page instead of in an overlay. Simply call .datepicker() on a div instead of an input."
[06:40:13] <fRAiLtY-> No, it just sends an e-mail. If I don't AJAX it and just do form action="myurl" its fine and the params pass nicely
[06:40:42] <thaifood> doolinkr, I tried to clarify  http://fpaste.org/006a/

[07:07:01] <AdamPDotty> Nancy: you use <div> instead of <a> there
[07:07:05] <AdamPDotty> for example
[07:11:25] <Nancy2012> where?

[07:45:59] <NoWired> I don't know how jsfiddle.net works....
[07:46:12] <pachet> poorly
[07:46:16] <pachet> is the answer to that question
[07:46:18] <bil`> badatss
[07:46:23] <rebel_yell_what>   $('#repeats_choices').change(function(){   if ($(this).val()==="daily"){   $('#repeats-daily-modal').fadeIn();   }   else if ($(this).val()==="weekly"){   $('#repeats-weekly-modal').fadeIn();   }   if ($(this).val()==="monthly"){   $('#repeats-monthly-modal').fadeIn();   };   });
[07:46:35] <rebel_yell_what> i can toggle it through a link
[07:46:48] <rebel_yell_what> quite easily but for some reason i cannot
[07:46:56] <rebel_yell_what> through an option select
[07:47:23] <rebel_yell_what> a href='#repeats-weekly-modal' data-toggle='modal' link
[07:47:36] <rebel_yell_what> anyway i can get that functionality in an option
[07:52:38] <Brodingo> rebel_yell_what i think you have an extra semicolon there
[07:52:50] <Brodingo> after the last if
[07:54:00] <lejocely> why would a javascript not work in the header but work next to the id it modifies ?
[07:54:24] <Brodingo> lejocely are you using a document ready function?
[07:54:49] <lejocely> Brodingo: I don't know what it is :(
[07:54:52] <lejocely> so it might be
[07:54:54] <Brodingo> ?ready
[07:54:54] <b-ot> Brodingo: called as soon as the DOM tree is parsed.
[07:54:54] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[07:55:24] <Brodingo> also, best practice is to put your scripts right before the end of the </body>
[07:55:27] <lejocely> I'm using this : http://api.jqueryui.com/1.9/autocomplete/

That also works, however while the lightbox is loaded the mainpage behind the lightbox is refreshing and it throws off the light box every refresh.   In concept is there a way when the lightbox loads to stop the refresh?  I am
[08:05:43] <brian233> doubting it.
[08:10:56] <brian233> I guess, I could compare the current data to the data that is to be refreshed, and if it hasn't changed don't update the div...  Otherwise it's indiscriminately updating every 5 seconds

[08:14:12] <Brodingo> mikeosterhout you have to delegate to a parent element
[08:14:32] <Brodingo> ?on @ mikeosterhout
[08:14:33] <bot-t> mikeosterhout, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:14:54] <Brodingo> check the second example
[08:16:12] <mikeosterhout> brodingo: thanks checking now
[08:18:40] <abstortedminds> Hey, I'm have a progress bar that i want updated continuously with a percentage from the server side php script.  So as the % of the operation comes down, id like to pass that to my progressbar update function.  can anyone point me into the right direction to do this?
[08:27:17] <lejocely> I've got a file in which there is 6000 names. My users will be look for these names within a text input. What's the best solution you think ? to use jquery .load() ?
[08:27:36] <lejocely> if there were more answers ?
[08:29:20] <Tisiphone_> gnarf
[08:30:35] <gnarf> hey
[08:31:38] <gnarf> abstortedminds: you're going to want to setup an ajax request that will give you the #, then update progress bar from the callback and call the same request with the same callback in a loop until it's done or fails
[08:32:00] <gnarf> lejocely: see http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete ?
[08:33:42] <Whirl3d> Could someone point me to an effective tutorial on how to make a horizontal drop down menu that accommodates resizing (i.e. becomes scrollable rather than wrapping on smaller devices)
[08:33:44] <abstortedminds> gnarf, just use .get() from jquery to loop it?
[08:33:46] <lejocely> gnarf: I saw it, but is it a good idea to do so with a list of names from a file on the server ?
[08:34:14] <jomofcw> Using the "queue" thing can I do $element.queue(function(){$(this).trigger('myEvent');}).queue(function(){$(this).trigger('myEvent');}) and then the second event "myEvent" will "wait" till the first one is finish to start. Is it that way it works please ?
[08:34:19] <gnarf> lejocely: you can ajax the list, build an array, and use it to make your autocomplete
[08:34:26] <gnarf> abstortedminds: basically, yes
[08:34:58] <EdwardIII> hey, not sure whether ##javascript or #jquery is the place for this, but this code causes an error in ie8: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/4732073 - it's #25, SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'run'
[08:35:08] <gnarf> jomofcw: .queue(function( next ) { $(this).trigger("myEvent"); ... next(); })
[08:35:35] <lejocely> gnarf: ok, I'll try that
[08:36:31] <gnarf> jomofcw: but I'm assuming the first trigger does some non-sync operation you are "waiting" on?
[08:36:42] <gnarf> you can also use elem.dequeue() to run the "next" queue function
[08:37:36] <EdwardIII> should point out it works in chrome
[08:38:07] <jomofcw> gnarf it is some animate fonction with test of position. Currently it "goes too far" if I click many time on the button :/...
[08:39:17] <gnarf> jomofcw: the animations use the same queue... you might want to use a second named queue
[08:41:14] <jomofcw> gnarf : to explain, it's a DIV I move from the left to right by step. And at each step I test if the left position is not under "-x". But if I click many time in a second, it move beyond that "-x" :/ (before the system force it to come back to "-x").

[08:47:29] <Ana_> Hello?
[08:47:34] <Whirl3d> Sorry to repeat my question, but could someone help with creating a scrollable horizontal menu. Specifically, I don't want the elements "half visible" because they extend off the page on smaller devices and wrapping doesn't work...
[08:47:36] <hlve> jomofcw, that's because you have no jquery loaded.
[08:47:36] <hlve> lol

[08:48:27] <gnarf> jomofcw: thats a whole lot of code :) seems like its overly complicated, can you describe its purpose?

[08:50:20] <dblosevn> What is the syntax to initalize a plugin on a selector now and in the future?
[08:50:25] <gnarf> I assume she means Ben "cowboy" Alman, but like why would you be looking to talk to him about building a website?
[08:50:34] <dblosevn> i was thinking .on but that only works for events
[08:50:46] <Ana_> oh yea sure.. Ben Alman
[08:50:46] <gnarf> dblosevn: that's a bit vague, each plugin is different
[08:50:56] <jomofcw> gnarf : this one works http://jsfiddle.net/YpE4f/3/
[08:51:01] <Ana_> because.. i thought he might build sites... does he?
[08:51:10] <dblosevn> any plugin
[08:51:11] <hlve> gnarf, he/she is trolling
[08:51:14] <hlve> ;|
[08:51:33] <dblosevn> we can just say fancybox for now

[08:53:09] <NoiseEee> Ana_: scream into your keyboard
[08:53:40] <Ana_> oh i just got his email
[08:53:45] <BillCriswell> Ana_: Not too loud.
[08:53:45] <Ana_> thanks
[08:54:34] <jomofcw> gnarf I modify it again to show you the button "prÃ©cÃ©dent" and "suivant that will appear on the left and the right side of the "list".
[08:54:45] <jomofcw> gnarf : http://jsfiddle.net/YpE4f/4/
[08:56:05] <dblosevn> ok let me reword this
[08:56:14] <gnarf> jomofcw: again, really hard to tell what it's supposed to do - especially since i don't read that language ;)
[08:56:51] <dblosevn> I want to avoid having to do $(selector).fancybox('destroy'); $(selector).fancybox(); every time I pull an ajax request and populate content
[08:57:16] <gnarf> dblosevn: fancybox is like ages old, I'm not sure if there is something hiding in there to refresh
[08:57:33] <gnarf> but for instance, most UI widgets let you call .widget( "refresh" )
[08:59:02] <gnarf> to re-read the state from the html
[08:59:07] <gnarf> i think mobile uses the same approach
[08:59:14] <gnarf> fancybox was last updated in 2010 tho
[08:59:19] <gnarf> thats forever ago
[08:59:32] <dblosevn> hmm, and that works to initalize the plugin on elements that werent in the dom when the plugin was first initalized?
[08:59:46] <gnarf> no
[08:59:51] <gnarf> if you are adding new content
[08:59:55] <gnarf> and you want to call fancybox on it
[09:00:05] <ner0x> Using dataTables can you set the #id of a returning TR from ajax?
[09:00:36] <gnarf> my suggestion would be to write your own jQuery.fn.newContent = function() { $(this).find( selector ).addBack( selector ).fancybox(); };
[09:00:41] <gnarf> then whenever you append new content
[09:00:42] <gnarf> you can
[09:00:57] <gnarf> $( html ).appendTo( "#somewhere" ).newContent();
[09:01:04] <dblosevn> I know I could do $(ret.html).find(selector).fancybox();
[09:01:20] <dblosevn> then inject it in the dom
[09:01:39] <gnarf> if you abstract it into a "newContent" function, its pretty easy to add others to it later as well, which is important
[09:02:01] <gnarf> but javascript and jQuery have no reliable way to detect elements being created
[09:02:23] <dblosevn> well how does event delegation work?
[09:02:36] <jomofcw> gnarf it doesn't do anything when you click on the "suivant" button on the right side of the list ? In my last fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/YpE4f/4/
[09:02:57] <dblosevn> if I delegate a click event on a.clickme and add a new <a class="clickme"> and click it the event will fire
[09:03:29] <jomofcw> it should dblosevn, if you target the element correctly
[09:03:57] <gnarf> dblosevn: delegation binds to a parent element
[09:04:09] <dblosevn> eg body, got ya
[09:04:17] <gnarf> and because events bubble, when you click on that <a> it traverses upwards until it finds the event handler
[09:04:31] <dblosevn> then it filters the event target?
[09:04:40] <gnarf> basically, yes
[09:05:08] <gnarf> you can't really do that with stuff like "run a plugin when i add this content"
[09:05:18] <dblosevn> actually i can
[09:05:23] <dblosevn> for this case
[09:05:53] <dblosevn> I will just delegate a click handler for a.gallery and fire $.fancybox manually
[09:06:51] <gnarf> suppose that works
[09:06:58] <dblosevn> not really initalizing the plugin on newly injected items but achieves the same effect
[09:07:03] <gnarf> i really should update my newContent plugin
[09:08:27] <dblosevn> everytime my ext grids refresh i have to reinstantiate my jquery plugins that are in the row data
[09:12:25] <brian233> Could someone please take a quick look at this and tell me if I am on the right track at all?  I am only trying to update the div when the data has changed, it just keeps refreshing as if the data is different.
[09:12:26] <brian233> http://pastebin.com/hB1XUVvt
[09:13:58] <gnarf> brian233: the data is probably slightly different from the html
[09:14:13] <gnarf> brian233: i would suggest saving the "lastData" as well, compare to that rather than read the html
[09:15:12] <jomofcw> gnarf... :D... sorry to disturb you mate but i'm sure you can help me if I success in showing you what I'm trying to do !
[09:16:34] <gnarf> brian233: http://pastebin.com/S6GjBx81
[09:17:09] <gnarf> jomofcw: My first suggestion would be to simplify the example... What exactly are you trying to acheive? you are animating >something< but I'm not sure what
[09:17:41] <gnarf> brian233: line 12 on that paste is backwards, should be lastData = data;
[09:18:45] <brian233> gnarf,  you are a genius.
[09:19:26] <brian233> it took me an hour to scrape together what you rewrote into something working in 37 seconds.  :)
[09:19:37] <gnarf> brian233: experience ;)
[09:20:47] <jomofcw> gnarf i've got a UL in a DIV. The UL has a width larger than the DIV's one. I want to "move" the UL in the DIV to left or to the right (to create a scroll effect).
[09:20:52] <jomofcw> Is that clearer ?
[09:21:26] <DoctorMonocular> hey everyone
[09:24:19] <jomofcw> gnarf each time I click on one of the link "suivant" or "prÃ©cÃ©dent" it move the UL to the right or to the left for Y pixel, where Y is the outer-witdh of the LI in the UL.
[09:24:51] <gnarf> jomofcw: so you're trying to do like a carosel?
[09:26:24] <jomofcw> gnarf kinda yea. A simple one, without any "3D effect".
[09:26:36] <jomofcw> Should I use a plugin in your opinion ?
[09:27:01] <gnarf> eh, its the kind of thing that should be simple enough to reproduce
[09:27:41] <DoctorMonocular> so, I'm trying to use the jquery port of wysihat, and it's working pretty much fine, but there's one thing I can't figure out. For some reason when I focus into the editor div (which is contenteditable), the text sometimes reflows. I can't figure out why it's doing that, and I want it to stop. Any ideas?
[09:28:48] <gnarf> jomofcw: lemme try this in a super simple example
[09:30:49] <jomofcw> gnarf OK ! Thanks for your time =).
[09:31:01] <jomofcw> I usually use complex solution to do simple thing :/.
[09:33:16] <g0bl1n> I am invoking a custom protocol handler, so can't use $.get(). Using $.ajax with dataType: "jsonp" adds the callback params. Can it be avoided ?
[09:34:49] <Nancy2012> i have a string 10/test"
[09:34:50] <Nancy2012> "
[09:35:03] <Nancy2012> how can i get this 10
[09:35:04] <Nancy2012> ?
[09:35:22] <pachet> parseInt('10/test', 10)
[09:35:25] <Nancy2012> this is an id what i need to pass to ajax call
[09:35:53] <Nancy2012> pachet: this value might be different â€¦.. 11/test
[09:36:09] <Nancy2012> 1/test, 5/test
[09:36:17] <pachet> doesnt matter as long as the format is consistent
[09:36:19] <Nancy2012> i need to get this numeric value
[09:36:22] <pachet> ie, a leading number
[09:36:52] <maxmoore14> since jqmData() is supposed to be used in place of data() for jqm projects, why doesn't it work without parameters?
[09:36:59] <Nancy2012>  it ll return me 10 â€¦. parseInt('10/test')
[09:37:21] <pachet> ?eval ['1/test', '2/test', '10/test'].map(function ( e ) { return parseInt(e, 10); })
[09:37:35] <pachet> well, no eval in here or i forgot the trigger
[09:37:37] <pachet> but you get the idea
[09:37:52] <pachet> ?eval ['1/test', '2/test', '10/test'].map(function ( e ) { return parseInt(e, 10); })
[09:37:53] <bot-t> pachet: [1, 2, 10]
[09:38:13] <pachet> Nancy2012^
[09:38:20] <Nancy2012> yes..
[09:39:10] <Nancy2012> my problem is a bit different .. i dont know what is numeric value on my variable.. but it has numeric valueâ€¦ i just want to get this numric value
[09:39:50] <g0bl1n> this is, I don't need the callback. I just need to call a different protocol. Something like "mailto:"
[09:40:11] <Nancy2012> manâ€¦. parseInt() works for me
[09:40:13] <Nancy2012> :)
[09:40:14] <Nancy2012> thanks
[09:40:57] <Flugelhorn> pachet: Why should i not be using split to get the numeric value?
[09:41:51] <pachet> because split makes more assumptions about your format?
[09:42:00] <pachet> i dont know, it seems like nitpicking to me, either way works
[09:42:12] <Flugelhorn> hmm. alrite. :)
[09:42:33] <maxmoore14> anybody know why calling jqmData() on an element returns undefined, but data() works?
[09:43:25] <maxmoore14> $('#foo').jqmData('bar') = 'some data'
[09:43:33] <maxmoore14> $('#foo').data('bar') = 'some data'
[09:43:36] <shoky> Note: Calling jqmData() with no argument will return undefined. This behavior is subject to change in future versions.
[09:43:47] <maxmoore14> $('#foo').jqmData() = undefined
[09:44:08] <maxmoore14> shoky: oh, is that line in the docs?
[09:44:12] <maxmoore14> I must have missed it
[09:44:13] <shoky> yes
[09:44:29] <maxmoore14> thanks
[09:44:31] <shoky> uhm
[09:44:44] <maxmoore14> I was focused on this: "Calling .data() with no parameters retrieves all of the values as a JavaScript object. This object can be safely cached in a variable as long as a new object is not set with .data(obj). Using the object directly to get or set values is faster than making individual calls to .data() to get or set each value:"
[09:44:48] <maxmoore14> from the jquery docs
[09:44:56] <g0bl1n> woot. Works.
[09:45:21] <maxmoore14> I thought it was meant to be a direct replacement for data() in all cases
[09:52:40] <gnarf> maxmoore14: for the most part, however... that particular use of jqmData() with no arguments is not safe to use
[09:53:00] <maxmoore14> gnarf: fair enough
[09:53:04] <gnarf> jqmData() is a helper to find stuff using the mobile "namespace" so you can have like data-jqm-role instead of data-role
[09:53:47] <gnarf> i remember doing a code review on that whole chunk of code when i rewrote .data() in core in 1.7/1.8
[09:54:05] <gnarf> and .jqmData() can't return you anything useful because of the way that object work
[09:54:48] <pachet> it was gnarf
[09:54:50] <pachet> in the library
[09:54:52] <pachet> with a text editor
[09:55:22] <gnarf> as .data() returns you a ref to the "real" data object, if .jqmData() were to return you a "new" object to map the namespaced keys, it would break the ability to change it and have it get reflected in the "real" data
[09:55:49] <gnarf> so i suggested they make it just return undef
[09:55:59] <gnarf> rather than try to manipulate it into something broken
[09:57:11] <maxmoore14> do you know if there is an updated doc like this one from ajpiano (http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1) for 1.9 with _super inheritance, etc
[09:57:24] <gnarf> maxmoore14: i'm actually working on that right now
[09:57:34] <maxmoore14> sweet
[09:57:59] <gnarf> maxmoore14: i'll be presenting it in vienna and toronto
[09:58:39] <johnkpaul> maxmoore14: gnarf there's this guide http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/an-in-depth-review-of-jquerys-widget-factory/
[09:58:54] <maxmoore14> some info on best practices for setting options like data-role="customwidget" data-foo="true" data-bar="something"
[09:58:59] <gnarf> maxmoore14: should be out/updated before then https://github.com/gnarf37/widgetfactory --- watch my fork
[09:59:13] <maxmoore14> gnarf: I will, thanks
[10:00:29] <maxmoore14> gnarf: also wondering, unrelated, is there a way to subscribe to the jqm blog by e-mail?
[10:02:34] <maxmoore14> gnarf: oh! here's something I've been curious about... I changed my widgets to use the new _on method for setting handlers. Does _off get called automatically by _destroy or do I have to call it explicitly?
[10:03:52] <gnarf> maxmoore14: if the events are all bound to the container, they are destroyed
[10:03:56] <gnarf> trying to remember the other rules tehre
[10:05:27] <maxmoore14> cool. I used to do this.element.on('click.customwidget', handler) and this.element.off('.customwidget') now this._on(this.element, {click: handler})
[10:05:29] <maxmoore14> right?
[10:05:50] <gnarf> you can skip the element
[10:06:15] <gnarf> this._on({ click: handle }) or this._on({ click: "_instanceMethod" })
[10:06:59] <maxmoore14> oh cool, though usually it would be more like this._on(this.element.find('something'), {click:handle})
[10:08:40] <gnarf> maxmoore14: when you bind to a second element, i think you are still responsible to remove them in destroy
[10:08:42] <gnarf> not 100% sure
[10:08:53] <maxmoore14> oh, hmm
[10:08:58] <maxmoore14> oh
[10:09:02] <maxmoore14> ok
[10:09:14] <gnarf> maxmoore14: also
[10:09:27] <gnarf> do you know about this._on({ "click .something": handle }); ?
[10:09:42] <gnarf> after the event name you can put a selector and it does delegated binding
[10:10:02] <maxmoore14> no, never seen that before
[10:10:30] <pachet> its just recycling the .on() signature
[10:10:33] <pachet> kinda

[10:12:19] <pachet> rcz: multiple source elements, idiomatically, are for specifying multiple possible formats
[10:12:39] <pachet> the browser walks them until it finds something it can use
[10:12:45] <rcz> I've seen people do $('#audioplayer')[0].play() to play a specific <source>, is this possible?
[10:12:46] <pachet> excuse me, can /probably/ use
[10:13:26] <sunbeam> i have a placeholder for a form input field
[10:13:30] <rcz> pachet, so I should just do something like   audio.src = trackName; audio.play();  when changing song?
[10:13:35] <sunbeam> i would like to check if this field is empty or if the placeholder isnt changed
[10:13:37] <sunbeam> how can i best doj this?
[10:13:59] <gnarf> maxmoore14: https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/5837bd097fb47b3b1acc
[10:14:00] <rcz> sunbeam, use the 'placeholder' attribute instead
[10:14:10] <pachet> rcz: i usually just fiddle with the src unless i'm using a lib, yeah
[10:14:28] <rcz> pachet, alright, thanks
[10:14:34] <sunbeam> rcz: i do use this
[10:14:41] <djQuery> sunbeam,  the easiest way would be to use any one the dozen place holder plugins
[10:14:57] <rcz> pachet, I just had trouble with pausing the song. If I play, pause and play again, it will just stop after a few seconds. Figured I was using it incorrectly
[10:15:21] <maxmoore14> gnarf: excellent, thanks
[10:15:22] <rcz> sunbeam, cam
[10:15:25] <rcz> oops
[10:15:33] <sunbeam> djQuery: i use that
[10:15:37] <rcz> sunbeam, can't you just check if value is empty
[10:15:51] <djQuery> sunbeam, and do like rcz  said and use the html5 placeholder attribute
[10:15:51] <sunbeam> rcz: so thats all i need to do ? if i use a placeholder="something" ?
[10:16:04] <djQuery> ?g html5 placeholder
[10:16:06] <bot-t> djQuery, HTML5's placeholder Attribute - http://davidwalsh.name/html5-placeholder
[10:16:14] <rcz> yes, placeholder="" doesn't send anything through a form, if that's what you mean
[10:16:33] <maxmoore14> so even if I do, this._on($('#somethingElse'), {click: handler}) it will still get removed during _destroy
[10:17:05] <djQuery> sunbeam, for modern browsers you don't even need the placeholder plugin, they will just work
[10:17:10] <sunbeam> rcz: djQuery
[10:17:16] <sunbeam> and i already use the placeholder plugin
[10:17:48] <gnarf> maxmoore14: according to scott, yes - i trust him ;)
[10:17:48] <rcz> sunbeam, you don't need a plugin, just use the HTML5 built in placeholder attribute
[10:17:59] <maxmoore14> haha, cool
[10:18:03] <maxmoore14> thanks for asking
[10:18:11] <djQuery> sunbeam, http://caniuse.com/#search=placeholder
[10:18:35] <sunbeam> how can i best check for an empty var?
[10:18:38] <gnarf> man, IE9 is so sad...
[10:18:48] <gnarf> doesn't even have placeholder?
[10:18:49] <thang> yes
[10:19:24] <rcz> sunbeam, !$(this).val()
[10:19:36] <djQuery> gnarf, yeah everything but IE9> and opera mini support it now
[10:19:43] <rcz> sunbeam, or !this.value
[10:20:39] <sunbeam> ok thanks
[10:20:44] <rcz> sunbeam, so if( !$('.textBox').val() ) { alert("textBox is empty"); }
[10:21:24] <sunbeam> yep
[10:21:41] <sunbeam> one more thing, i also want to check whether 1 or more checkboxes are checked inside a div.form
[10:21:44] <maxmoore14> gnarf: I know I am not supposed to use the ui namespace when creating widgets with jqueryui, but what about the mobile namespace for jqm widgets?
[10:21:44] <sunbeam> any idea how i do this?
[10:22:08] <pachet> what is a div.form :[
[10:22:15] <pachet> a <div class="form">?
[10:23:02] <gnarf> maxmoore14: you should use your own namespace for your own widgets :)
[10:23:07] <djQuery> sunbeam, $('div.form').find(input:checked')
[10:24:17] <sunbeam> thanks
[10:24:21] <sunbeam> pachet: yes
[10:27:45] <sunbeam> djQuery: if($('form.advanced-form').find('input:checked')) { }
[10:27:47] <sunbeam> like this?
[10:31:36] <Maverick|MSG> is there a way to scroll down programmatically in a jquery multiselect dropdown?
[10:36:36] <maxmoore14> how would I use nested namespaces with a widget? say I want $.widget('mcm.mobile.customwidget', {})
[10:37:04] <maxmoore14> it is throwing an error when I call $('#foo').mcm.mobile.customwidget()
[10:37:29] <maxmoore14> not sure I fully understand creating namespaces
[10:37:48] <maxmoore14> anyone have a good tutorial?
[10:41:08] <akkufomk> is there more taxing on the browser using jQuery.each() over a normal for loop?
[10:42:30] <tw2113> http://jsperf.com/jquery-each-vs-for-loop/26
[10:42:31] <pachet> that depends on a lot of things
[10:44:26] <akkufomk> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/10-ways-to-instantly-increase-your-jquery-performance/
[10:44:32] <akkufomk> yeah item 3
[10:44:46] <akkufomk> I was passing about 1056 to an each and it was locking the browser up
[10:44:53] <akkufomk> I changed it to a for and it's like awesome now
[10:49:34] <Es0teric> how do i automatically make jquery detect a hash in the url everytime a click occurs?
[10:51:30] <jd823592> Hi api doc says .innerHeight returns integer but i am getting float which would force me to use rounding all over the place... is this bug... am i doing something wrong?
[10:52:16] <gnarf> jd823592: there aren't ints or floats in JS - just Number's
[10:52:38] <gnarf> i think .innerHeight will return fractional px if the height is actually fractional
[10:53:20] <jd823592> gnarf: i know that they are not as types but then i dont understand why the api does not say number... when i see Integer i dont assume to get 400.16666667 which is what i get now
[10:53:38] <pachet> just 123.456 | 0 it if you want an integer :[
[10:53:39] <sorahn> is there any way to make jquery spit out things that it normally silently fails on?
[10:53:51] <pachet> sorahn: examples?
[10:54:05] <jd823592> gnarf: .height() is also fractional thats right, outerHeight is not
[10:54:09] <sorahn> pachet: trying to operate on a busted selector
[10:54:17] <sorahn> (thats the easiest suggestion anyway)
[10:54:25] <sorahn> i know I can check againgst $object.length
[10:54:50] <sorahn> against*  But i was just wondering if there was some global setting you could set somewhere that would make it throw errors, instead of just siting around quietly
[10:54:57] <pachet> not that i know of
[10:55:03] <sorahn> bummer
[10:55:12] <jd823592> pachet: well i could do that but it is very ugly way... when ever i forget to round it i have a problem...
[10:55:38] <Antiga> not sure why you're even getting decimals back, it's only ever been integers for me
[10:56:24] <pachet> sorahn: if your modules are wrapped you can be clever and pass in a mock obj that will error on selectors that return l === 0
[10:57:53] <thisboy> http://home.no/reddvinylene/test/ -- anybody know why this fluid seamless image Masonry using Isotope (http://metafizzy.co/blog/beyonce-seamless-fluid-image-masonry/) crashes on mobile (AppleWebKit)?
[10:57:59] <sorahn> pachet, yea thats what we are doing, we were just wondering if there was something faster we could use for development.  I found this: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-lint/ but it's a little out of date.
[10:59:54] <Shizen> hmmm.... anyone have any idea how to properly bootstrap jquery and jquerymobile inside phonegap ?
[11:07:48] <lil-murph> If i .append a new <div>, can I get that div back to apply a click handler to it? is there a best way to do that?
[11:08:45] <BillCriswell> lil-murph: You could do like... var $div = $('<div/>'); then do $div.on('click', function(){ }); then $('#foo').append($div);
[11:15:03] <Es0teric> ok so i do i inject data from a $.each() into specific divs on every click while in a getJSON request?
[11:24:51] <BillCriswell> Are you guys for or against class names like "grid-4" and such? I keep going back and forth on it... would love to hear other opinions.
[11:25:51] <Es0teric> BillCriswell are you good with getJSON?
[11:26:02] <Es0teric> or would you rather use $.ajax?
[11:27:17] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Depends on the job at hand.
[11:28:06] <Es0teric> BillCriswell ok well right now i have a $.each() loop and anchors being generated in a getJSON... but i need to inject the data in each key depending on whats being clicked in a div that contains a modal
[11:29:07] * hlve slaps BillCriswell around a bit with a large trout
[11:30:13] <BillCriswell> Haha
[11:30:39] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Having a hard time following that. Don't think I'm at the top of my game today.
[11:30:45] <BillCriswell> Do you have some code I can look at instead?
[11:31:06] <Es0teric> BillCriswell well i have the getJSON request and the $.each() loop
[11:32:26] <Christop_> Prior to jQ 1.9, we used $().data('tabs') to get a handle on the tabs at some point later in the process.  It looks like now tabs are stored in a data item called uiTabs.  I can't seem to find a discussion about this change on the jQ or jQ UI site.  Does anyone know of a page where I can get more information about this change?
[11:33:12] <Es0teric> BillCriswell well what i want to do is inject data into a modal everytime the corresponding anchor is clicked
[11:33:14] <Es0teric> basically
[11:33:23] <shoky> Christop_: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#changed-naming-convention-for-data-keys
[11:33:46] <Es0teric> but i dont want to create multiple modals, i just want one modal being updated with getJSON data when the anchor is clicked
[11:34:21] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: So like... $('.foo').on('click', function(e){ var id = $(this).attr('data-id'); load(id); }); or something?
[11:34:40] <Es0teric> BillCriswell no because this is all data from a $.each() in a getJSON request
[11:34:46] <Christop_> shoky: excellent.  thanks for the link!
[11:35:13] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: So like... $('.container').on('click', '.foo', function(e){ var id = $(this).attr('data-id'); load(id); });
[11:35:37] <Es0teric> BillCriswell i thought load() was used for outside pages only
[11:35:38] <Es0teric> o.O
[11:36:09] <BillCriswell> I'm just using tht as a generic function name.
[11:36:13] <BillCriswell> Not jQuerys load.
[11:36:17] <Es0teric> oh, then yes, BillCriswell
[11:36:55] <Es0teric> BillCriswell but i think it would be easier for me to detect it if i just inject a id in the modal from a key-val that was injected into an anchor
[11:37:47] <Es0teric> so if the anchor has $('<a />', { href : "v.someTitle.t"}) (being generated from the $.each()
[11:38:03] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:38:24] <Es0teric> so that would be injected into the modal, and if thats detected in the URL to just load corresponding info
[11:38:38] <Es0teric> and then put corresponding info inside elements of modal
[11:39:13] <shoky> ok
[11:39:19] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have something like this:   <a href="...." ><span id="myspan">test</span> thisisthewordiwant</a>  How do i get ONLY thisisthewordiwant ?
[11:40:11] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Get the immediate child text nodes of the <a>.
[11:41:26] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Ohh... so you're reading the hash and you want to load some specific thingie?
[11:41:48] <Es0teric> BillCriswell well yeah, i think thats the easiest way to do it
[11:42:01] <shoky> Krambiorix: see ?contents
[11:42:01] <bot-t> Krambiorix, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[11:42:11] <Es0teric> but again, this is data from multiple keys inside the getJSON request, BillCriswell
[11:42:21] <Es0teric> i only want to load the corresponding data when an anchor is clicked
[11:42:30] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Lost me again.
[11:42:51] <BillCriswell> Don't do too good when things are explained to me. If I see some pseudo code I might be more useful.
[11:42:55] <Krambiorix> shoky, thx!
[11:43:18] <Es0teric> BillCriswell ok let me create some pseudo-code
[11:47:08] <Krambiorix> shoky, so that would be something like  mystring.contents().filter(function(){ return this.nodeType != 1; })
[11:47:49] <Krambiorix> shoky, i get an object back
[11:47:55] * hlve slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[11:48:57] <shoky> Krambiorix:  for your sample html it'd be enough to do .contents().last().text()
[11:49:29] <shoky> Krambiorix: and == 3  if you want only text nodes ;p
[11:49:56] <shoky> Krambiorix:  yes, you get a jquery object back
[11:50:26] <Krambiorix> shoky, what should i call on that object to get the string?
[11:51:15] <shoky> Krambiorix: .text()
[11:57:39] <Krambiorix> thx shoky
[11:57:51] <hlve> Yes, thanks shoky
[11:58:00] <hlve> you make every day better with your jquery know-how
[11:58:16] <scar> Is there a way to access elements inside an iframe?
[11:58:21] <shoky> thx hlve
[11:58:44] <shoky> scar if its on the same origin, yea
[11:59:08] <scar> using a simple class or ID for the selector doesn't grab it.
[11:59:39] <scar> you know what.... probably bc it's inserted via js... im trying to manipulate the width of a container inside the facebook comment box that pops up after you click like
[11:59:47] <shoky> scar: here's a fiddle where i do it, there might be simpler ways  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gkbN5/
[12:00:02] <angrywombat> if i had a text input with the content 'key1=val1,key2=val2', is there any easy way in jquery to split all that shit in to an array?
[12:00:07] <angrywombat> the outcome would be something like {key1: 'val1', key2: 'val2'}
[12:03:16] <scar> shoky, so i can .find('.my-div').animate() ?
[12:03:43] <shoky> scar: http://jsfiddle.net/gkbN5/4/
[12:04:10] <scar> why did you remove .contentDocument ?
[12:04:17] <shoky> i didn't
[12:04:27] <shoky> just accessing it differently now
[12:04:38] <shoky> doesn't matter
[12:05:08] <Es0teric> BillCriswell -> http://jsfiddle.net/bNZAQ/1/
[12:06:14] <masterfla> hi guys i am looking for a way to disable buttons while animating an element
[12:06:25] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Ok. So with this you want to...?
[12:06:33] <masterfla> I tried the prop function but it only works for button i guess
[12:06:33] <masterfla> http://jsfiddle.net/G9Brq/4/
[12:07:28] <Es0teric> BillCriswell every time an anchor is clicked to put the data in $.each() to corresponding places in the modal
[12:07:34] <scar> what is wrng with this?
[12:07:34] <scar> $(i).find('._5v4').animate({ width:280px; }, 500, function() {});
[12:07:57] <shoky> it's not javascript
[12:07:58] <Es0teric> BillCriswell for instance v.book.title would go in <h4> of the modal
[12:08:21] <scar> How so? lol
[12:08:26] <shoky> scar:  280px ain't javascript
[12:08:32] <scar> oh
[12:08:32] <Es0teric> v.bookInfo.description would go in <p> on the .modal-body, BillCriswell
[12:08:34] <scar> quotes :)
[12:08:45] <shoky> scar: and remove the semicolon ;p
[12:09:11] <shoky> also, no need for quotes if you remove the px
[12:09:21] <scar> blah, it's not working ..ill have to dig it
[12:09:56] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: You want to store the JSON on the element?
[12:10:17] <Es0teric> BillCriswell well... yeah for every click that is made to the anchor
[12:10:38] <Es0teric> because when an anchor is clicked, v.book.a already generates a hash in the url
[12:10:45] <Es0teric> so really thats what you would be looking at in the modal
[12:11:12] <Es0teric> contents in key 0 or 1 or whatever is clicked
[12:11:46] <BillCriswell> I think I got you... So you basically want to load data[2] if the third book is clicked?
[12:13:08] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: The way I'd do it would be like... <a href="/books/id" data-book-id="45"></a> and when it's clicked I'd run a query just for book 45.
[12:13:32] <BillCriswell> <a href="/books/45" data-book-id="45">
[12:14:05] <shoky> scar: are you getting any errors in the console?
[12:14:13] <Es0teric> BillCriswell so you would run that query against the json data already retreived?
[12:14:14] <scar> shoky, nope
[12:15:00] <scar> shoky, this FB comment popup is annoying me.
[12:15:05] <scar> lol
[12:15:24] <shoky> no idea what you mean ;p
[12:16:04] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: If you have to get the list data i'd probably just store a copy in $('a').data(bookData) and grab that when it's clicked.
[12:16:11] <scar> shoky, can i pm you a link?
[12:16:19] <shoky> ya
[12:16:21] <Otineb> Hello gents! So. I'm a little new to jquery and javascript and have cobbled together this function to capitalize words on an input field that match certain ID's. Now it looks like backspace and arrow keys don't work. I know i have to declare "false" each affected key code but have no clue how to write it correctly. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/V4ATc/
[12:16:34] <Es0teric> BillCriswell can you show me real quick?
[12:16:37] <scar> if you like it (you can unlike) the popup comes out, but is cut off bc of the sidebar width
[12:16:46] <Es0teric> i because i dont get it right now lol
[12:17:14] <scar> shoky, i found the proper div to resize within iframe to make it more narrow and  taller, and it looks perfect. i can hide the FB button, removing the entire comment box completely, but there's a delay as the FB button has to receive a response from FB.. so it still pops up ugly
[12:17:26] <scar> shoky, keep in mind i did NOT code this site
[12:17:31] <scar> just merely need to add a facebook button feature
[12:17:46] <scar> the code is so bad ....
[12:18:46] <shoky> scar: i donno what iframe you're talkin about
[12:19:01] <scar> shoky, when you click LIKE, facebook pops up a commnet box
[12:19:09] <scar> like button, top left
[12:19:17] <scar> you can then unlike it if you want. just a typical fb button
[12:19:55] <shoky> maybe i got someth blocking it dono
[12:20:22] <BlaDe^> any ideas why this code works in my browser, but not on my iPhone? http://pastie.org/private/swdbdul8iz5c0zw6dkbgxg
[12:20:23] <scar> the comment box doesnt pop up? when you click like it says you can type a msg and share with ur friends
[12:20:24] <shoky> scar: anyway.. this doesn't sound like a same-origin iframe
[12:20:31] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/bNZAQ/2/
[12:20:32] <shoky> scar: i don't see a like button.
[12:20:35] <scar> top left
[12:20:43] <shoky> yep
[12:20:49] <shoky> i see 'stay connected' buttons
[12:20:59] <scar> hmm
[12:21:06] <shoky> maybe i got something blocking it
[12:21:08] <scar> oh well, i guess it dosnt matter bc i cant do it anyway
[12:21:09] <scar> lol
[12:21:47] <Es0teric> BillCriswell how does that even work without looping through the data?
[12:21:58] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: It is.
[12:22:15] <BillCriswell> $.each( data ...
[12:22:32] <BillCriswell> I ust took out the AJAX part.
[12:22:39] <Es0teric> ohhhhhhhhhhh, BillCriswell
[12:22:43] <Es0teric> ok i just saw that
[12:23:11] <scar> :\
[12:23:54] <Es0teric> alright, BillCriswell let me try that
[12:25:00] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/bNZAQ/3/ might be a little simpler to understand.
[12:26:06] * hlve slaps Es0teric around a bit with a large trout
[12:26:15] <hlve> tell me your name is fromt he hip hop artist
[12:26:18] <hlve> i will love you long time
[12:27:30] <Es0teric> hlve yes... 7L & Esoteric
[12:27:59] <hlve> =)
[12:28:30] <Es0teric> Esoteric also from i think JMT or AOTP
[12:29:02] <Es0teric> BillCriswell you are a freakin genius
[12:29:04] <Es0teric> thanks man
[12:29:44] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:30:17] <Es0teric> BillCriswell so then all i have to do
[12:30:28] <Es0teric> is append the data to the modal, right?
[12:30:34] <Es0teric> details.a
[12:30:41] <Es0teric> or details.t
[12:31:20] <Es0teric> BillCriswell and i can do this outside of the loop or does it have to be inside the loop?
[12:31:36] <BillCriswell> You can pass it to a function outside the loop.
[12:31:59] <BillCriswell> to keep your code neat, if you want. To be honest I don't do too much stuff like this.
[12:32:21] <Es0teric> BillCriswell so then if (details) { //handle code that was clicked? }
[12:32:32] <djQuery> Es0teric, have you looked at a templating template for something like this?
[12:32:50] <Es0teric> djQuery man... this is only for like one or two pages
[12:32:58] <Es0teric> i dont see the purpose in using a templating lib
[12:33:16] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: That sounds about good.
[12:33:22] <djQuery> Es0teric, cool if you have the need try looking at http://knockoutjs.com/
[12:33:59] <BillCriswell> I need to learn some kind of JS framework that's not jQuery.
[12:34:20] <BillCriswell> I played with Meteor a bit, but if I don't have a solid goal in mind I'll never learn it right lol
[12:34:27] <Es0teric> lol
[12:34:32] <Es0teric> man... i used underscorejs
[12:34:34] <Es0teric> before
[12:34:36] <Es0teric> i actually like it
[12:34:46] <Es0teric> i mixed it with jquery though
[12:35:03] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that doesn't do nearly what knockout or meteor does.
[12:36:25] <djQuery> I went with knockout instead of backbone because I liked the docs better
[12:36:29] <Es0teric> i tend to go to the frameworks that have a very good looking website
[12:39:01] <StephenS> when I have jquery script and its executing only if code is after <div id...>
[12:39:06] <StephenS> how can I change that?
[12:39:50] <BillCriswell> StephenS: $(function(){ // I'll run when everything is "ready" });
[12:40:28] <Es0teric> ok so i have to ask... ive seen alot of hype over backbonejs
[12:40:36] <Es0teric> what is backbone mainly used for?
[12:41:00] <StephenS> ok
[12:41:18] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: It's probably exactly what you should be using lol.
[12:41:37] <BillCriswell> For what I was just helping you with.
[12:42:20] <Es0teric> BillCriswell yeah but someone advised me not to use it yet... since i dont have enough exp
[12:42:33] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I think it's good advice for sure.
[12:42:54] <Es0teric> but if i shouldnt be using backbone
[12:43:02] <Es0teric> doesnt that mean i shouldnt be using knockoutjs either?
[12:43:10] <BillCriswell> Have to learn somewhere.
[12:43:19] <BillCriswell> If you have the time, try it out and break shit.
[12:43:28] <Es0teric> lmao BillCriswell
[12:43:41] <Es0teric> man i can try it out... but this is a personal project i am working on
[12:43:50] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: So you have plenty of time!
[12:44:05] <Es0teric> yeah but i kinda want to finish it asap
[12:44:09] <Es0teric> so i can move into other things
[12:48:42] <SandRat> Es0teric: Give this comparison a go - chalk full of info bit.ly/Xre1C3
[12:48:55] <StephenS> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/enWLf/ why does this not load on page load?
[12:49:08] <Es0teric> you see
[12:49:11] <Es0teric> i liked emberjs
[12:49:14] <Es0teric> i saw that
[12:49:46] <StephenS> can someone help me?
[12:51:10] <NoiseEee> StephenS: because you have no tooltip function?  http://jsfiddle.net/enWLf/1/
[12:53:03] <StephenS> THANKS!
[12:54:05] <Es0teric> also, BillCriswell details returns "undefined" when clicked
[12:55:56] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I took out the .data('details', v); in the second example I set so it wouldn't work.
[12:56:25] <Es0teric> oh i see
[12:56:31] <Es0teric> so all i have to do is add v
[12:56:35] <Es0teric> as the second param
[12:57:41] <BillCriswell> I was just doing that so you can work outside of things in the first example. You can just use v in that .on() call without worry about details.
[12:58:01] <Es0teric> oh right
[12:58:09] <Es0teric> because for every click, it shows the details anyways
[12:58:10] <Es0teric> right right
[12:58:27] <djQuery> Es0teric, just been looking at meteor and thats pretty cool
[12:58:39] <Es0teric> djQuery yeah meteor looks nice
[12:58:51] <Es0teric> but i dont think i am at the level of templating with js
[12:59:02] <Es0teric> i mean, i am at MVC level with php
[12:59:13] <Es0teric> but not with js... ruby is nice as fuck tho
[13:01:39] <StephenS> What is the best tooltip plugin to use but it must to remain on page until I hover mouse offside tooltip box
[13:01:58] <djQuery> StephenS, ui.tooltip
[13:02:21] <StephenS> Yes I know on http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[13:02:22] <djQuery> StephenS, especialy if you are allready using any other jquery ui components
[13:02:25] <StephenS> but I cannot find that one
[13:02:32] <Es0teric> damn it man... this sucks now when i dismiss the modal, it dismisses the results that i just showed
[13:02:36] <Es0teric> i only want to dismiss the modal
[13:02:40] <Es0teric> not the rest of the stuff
[13:03:22] <djQuery> Es0teric, $('#myDiv').dialog('option', 'modal', false)
[13:03:39] <Es0teric> djQuery i am using twitter bootstrap modal
[13:03:41] <Es0teric> i like it better
[13:03:55] <Es0teric> lol
[13:04:05] <djQuery> Es0teric, does it not have a set option comand?
[13:04:46] <Es0teric> nope, djQuery
[13:05:09] <djQuery> Es0teric, does it create an overlay the same way that ui.dialog does.
[13:05:24] <djQuery> $('div.overlay').hide();
[13:06:21] <Es0teric> yeah it does create an overlay
[13:08:24] <djQuery> Es0teric, just tried it on thier tuts and I was able to hide the overlay in chrome developer
[13:08:49] <djQuery> so find what class it adds to it then select it and hide it
[13:10:02] <djQuery> StephenS, just click on the download at the jqueryui.com site
[13:10:30] <StephenS> I already use it on my website
[13:10:44] <StephenS> however I cannot manage to make that thing to tooltip remain
[13:10:51] <StephenS> while its on that link or inside tooltip
[13:11:01] <StephenS> and to hide when its outside of tooltip for about half of second
[13:11:13] <Otineb> hey guys, I"m trying to get a form input box to auto capitalize AND allow for backspace/arrow keys to work. I've got this written but can't figure out why it's not working. What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/V4ATc/8/
[13:11:18] <djQuery> StephenS, see ?demo
[13:11:19] <bot-t> StephenS, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:11:23] <NoiseEee> look into onmouseenter/onmouseleave
[13:11:30] <djQuery> StephenS, will try to help with it
[13:11:35] <StephenS> hold up
[13:11:38] <StephenS> Imma paste what I did
[13:12:39] <StephenS> http://jsfiddle.net/uQu4h/
[13:12:48] <StephenS> That is timer and hide() func when it should hide
[13:12:56] <StephenS> however dunno how to implement it into working tooltip
[13:13:10] <djQuery> StephenS, only 1 global timeout?
[13:13:31] <StephenS> yeah it should be inside function
[13:13:37] <StephenS> my bad
[13:14:00] <djQuery> StephenS, maybe not
[13:14:22] <StephenS> Can you check what is wrong?
[13:14:51] <StephenS> also on hover its showing slowly
[13:14:59] <StephenS> and not instantly, but there is no .show() inside UI's tooltip
[13:15:59] <Otineb> can anyone help?
[13:18:09] <djQuery> StephenS, not having much luck withit myself
[13:18:17] <Es0teric> so removing any extra text that gets appended would be $(this).children().remove()?
[13:18:29] <djQuery> StephenS, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/uQu4h/2/    no error no tooltip
[13:18:41] <Es0teric> or how about removing the text thats previous of the click
[13:19:47] <Es0teric> how do i remove previous appended content on every click though?
[13:19:49] <djQuery> Otineb, what are the e.keyCode == 8 || e.keyCode == 38 || e.keyCode == 39 || e.keyCode == 56    keys?
[13:20:00] <gf3> Otinebot: Also
[13:20:02] <gf3> Otineb: "hey there guy".replace(/^[a-z]| [a-z]/g, function(s) { return s.toUpperCase(); })
[13:20:06] <djQuery> Otineb, shouldn't you just return instead of return false?
[13:20:18] <gf3> js> print("hey there guy".replace(/^[a-z]| [a-z]/g, function(s) { return s.toUpperCase(); })) // Otineb
[13:20:21] <b-ot> gf3: Hey There Guy
[13:20:42] <Otineb> @djQuery: backspace/left arrow/right arrow/delete
[13:21:12] <djQuery> Otineb, well returning false would basicaly disable those keys
[13:21:20] <StephenS> DJDan, http://jsfiddle.net/uQu4h/3/
[13:21:25] <StephenS> djQuery, http://jsfiddle.net/uQu4h/3/
[13:21:40] <gf3> Otineb: Firstly, I would debounce this function
[13:21:51] <gf3> Otineb: Then simplify it
[13:22:04] <Otineb> @djQuery : lol really? The script works if I remove the IF statement but if the user tries to arrow key left, it kicks them to the end of the string
[13:22:33] <gf3> Otineb: You can try to restore cursor position but it's a PITA
[13:22:44] <Otineb> @gf3: Please understand I'm a super noob. I basically cobbled this script together from various stack overflow threads so I'm pretty lucky it even kind of works.
[13:22:44] <djQuery> Otineb, simply returning or return true will allow those keys to work without the rest of the funtion running
[13:22:44] <b-ot> Otineb: Sorry, no results for â€Ÿsite:developer.mozilla.org a super noob. I basically cobbled this script together from various stack overflow threads so I'm pretty lucky it even kind of works.â€.
[13:23:05] <Otineb> @djQuery oh really!
[13:23:40] <djQuery> Otineb, yes returning false basicaly disables those keys and doesnt run the rest of the code
[13:24:00] <Otineb> hmm. so this? http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/V4ATc/11/
[13:24:08] <StephenS>          0
[13:24:12] <StephenS>                                 0
[13:24:15] <djQuery> so combine mine and gf3 and you should have it working.    I suck at regular expressions
[13:27:31] <Otineb> @djQuery and gf3: I'm sorry guys, I'm so noobish at jquery - I'm not exactly sure how to combine what the two of you said.
[13:28:04] <Es0teric> djQuery how would you remove previously appended text on an element that appends text on every click?
[13:29:16] <Otineb> @djQuery: so here is the original. note the arrow keys do not work. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/V4ATc/
[13:30:10] <NoiseEee> Es0teric: store a reference when you append, use it to remove
[13:32:59] <djQuery> StephenS, I did this before but I had to write some weird code on blur of the item being hovered
[13:33:08] <jirka_on_d> hello all, could somebody give me a hint how to initialize jquery chosen with preselected values please?
[13:33:31] <djQuery> I set a short timeout there then canceled the time out when the hover happened over the item or the tooltip
[13:33:56] <djQuery> jirka_on_d, question makes no sense more details
[13:34:06] <Otineb> @gf3 : deboucing sounds offing amazing
[13:34:44] <gf3> Otineb: Ya bro
[13:39:59] <jirka_on_d> djQuery>I've got search form with "facets" (user can choose options in several search criteria) implemented using chosen. user submits the form (with some options checked) and i'd like to have chosen field filled with these values after the submission
[13:53:14] <jirka_on_d> the problem is, that chosen underlying element is not <select ...> but set of checkboxes
[14:00:09] <Bizzeh> hi, im using $('#content:not(.nosort)').sortable().disableSelection(); to have a set of divs be sortable and preventing certain divs from being sortable, but, i would like to prevent .nosort divs from even being draggable. is that possible?

[14:51:21] <brainwarped> I'm working on developing a site that uses a full-screen background image with some fixed position attributes overlayed. The background image must load based on the resolution and browser window size (css media queries). Also, it the image must reload based on detecting a change in the browser window size (ie, maximizing a window or changing the view on an iphone from portrait to landscape).
[14:51:21] <brainwarped> The last requirement is when the user zooms. I want to create a focal point that the user zooms "onto", with no possibility of the user zooming further than when that dimension hits a browser border. I'm willing to use html, css, javascript/jquery and python server side. Anyone have an example of this, or know how can I do this??
[14:57:54] <MariusKarthaus> HI, how do I hook into the animation steps for jquery0ui animations using hide() and show()?
[14:58:09] <MariusKarthaus> jquery-ui
[14:58:44] <MariusKarthaus> jquery has a 'steps' option but it is missing once you load jquery-ui
[15:02:02] <Colmea> Hello
[15:04:11] <Colmea> I have an issue with slideToggle() method. It seems to be triggered (I see some pixels moving), but element doesn't slide down as expected
[15:04:22] <brainwarped> anyone use supersized for my question above?
[15:04:54] <Colmea> Here is my little script: http://pastebin.com/9KMMdvbp
[15:08:13] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/9Xcr0K2d
[15:08:17] <vacho> why is the delay not honored??
[15:08:38] <ajpiano> ?delay2 @ vacho
[15:08:38] <bot-t> vacho, .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
[15:09:57] <vacho> ajpiano: how would I use timeout in that context?
[15:10:37] <ajpiano> setTimeout(function() { selector.find("a").show(); }, 500)
[15:18:10] <maxmoore14> anyone know why there is no refresh method for navbar?
[15:19:23] <maxmoore14> is there a good workaround? I need to remove elements from the DOM and then have it refresh the class assignments so the grid is laid out correctly
[15:19:30] <Colmea> Actually, I try to use toggle() method, but it's toggle() effect wich is trigered. Do you know why ?
[15:26:21] <kamo> hello all
[15:26:31] <kamo> Which is is faster?
[15:26:55] <kamo> $(this).css({});
[15:27:14] <kamo> or $(this).addClass();
[15:27:51] <gf3> kamo: It probably doesn't matter
[15:29:08] <kamo> Well which would cause less reflows?
[15:29:49] <systemfault> In most of the cases, using classes is better.
[15:30:35] <gf3> kamo: If you're doing the equivalent operation with each, they will both do the same amount of reflow
[15:30:39] <systemfault> You can more easily add  properties in batch with themâ€¦ and also, you're avoiding mixing styling and code
[15:34:09] <kamo> Thank you
[15:34:16] <kamo> for the information
[15:44:17] <ZnowDog>  Hi all ... having insane issues with contenteditable on dynamicly created elements on Chrome ... always false ... however if I manually use devtools to go in and change to true on attribute all works ... Please some advice
[15:57:15] <spiderworm> hi, i'm loading a .js file via $.ajax() â€¦ i noticed that it eval()s the response before passing it to my success method.  can this be prevented with configuration?
[15:58:44] <dblosevn> spiderworm: are you setting the content-type on the server to application/json?
[15:58:55] <dblosevn> or text/javascript
[15:59:06] <spiderworm> good question, let me check what the response type is
[15:59:31] <spiderworm> it's application/javascript
[16:00:37] <dblosevn> then theres your answer $,ajax detects a jaavascript response and is parsing it
[16:01:12] <spiderworm> and that can't be prevented?
[16:01:49] <spiderworm> I may be left to write my own xmlhttprequests manually
[16:01:59] <shoky> spiderworm: you can set a dataType e.g. dataType: 'text'
[16:02:07] <dblosevn> you could do $.ajax{ .... converters ("javascript": window.String}
[16:02:49] <dblosevn> shoky++ didnt read down the doc far enough
[16:03:14] <spiderworm> why's that dblosevn?
[16:03:16] <dblosevn> i saw content-type but that was for the request next thing i saw close was convertors
[16:03:32] <spiderworm> oh, i see what you meant
[16:03:44] <spiderworm> cool, so dataType: 'text' does seem to work
[16:03:51] <spiderworm> thank you gentlemen!
[16:07:02] <ZnowDog> script wont be run if you dont execute it
[16:07:25] <shoky> it'll be run if jquery executes it
[16:07:40] <ZnowDog> even in an ajax request?
[16:07:44] <ZnowDog> you are kidding me
[16:07:59] * coldhead np: swans - lunacy
[16:10:15] <Es0teric> how how you use jquery selector in a $.each() to create a new instance of a ul but append multiple li's?
[16:15:07] <shoky> just_do_it
[16:18:09] <tw2113> Es0teric, http://jsbin.com/elocok/1/edit
[16:18:48] <Es0teric> tw2113 i already figured it out lol
[16:20:09] <tw2113> goo
[16:20:16] <coldhead> great work Es0teric
[16:20:19] <Es0teric> mine was abit more... differnt... list = $('#mydiv').append($("<ul />", { class : "someclass"})). then $.each(data, function(i, v) {  list.append('<li>' + v + "</li>") })
[16:20:53] <Es0teric> tw2113 ^
[16:21:03] <Es0teric> and thanks, coldhead ... idk if you're being sarcastic though
[16:21:04] <Es0teric> >.>
[16:24:09] <tw2113> oops meant to say "good"
[16:24:35] <coldhead> of course i'm not being sarcastic
[16:24:41] <coldhead> i am genuinely happy for you
[16:24:46] <coldhead> and proud of all that you have accomplished
[16:24:57] <tw2113> coldhead, tends to be more sardonic :)
[16:25:11] <coldhead> everyone in #jQuery is fighting a hard battle and you guys are killing it and then knocking it out of the park
[16:25:34] <coldhead> aye, sardonic's the word for it
[16:26:31] <tw2113> i'm dealing with server BS today
[16:34:31] <coldhead> i am sorry for you loss, tw2113
[16:34:33] <coldhead> kick some goals
[16:34:40] <emmy> time for real things
[16:35:05] <emmy> can some one help me i dont understand
[16:35:47] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can someone help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/RswxD/1/   how do i change the value of the data field from the document table
[16:36:47] <coldhead> this is some exquisite table nesting, sheilablackrose
[16:38:13] <sheilablackrose> yeah im using mvc so the table is nested in a page. so i want to do a function call from that page(documents table) that will change the value of the row above it
[16:39:05] <sheilablackrose> i tried something like ($(this).closest('table').previous('tr').data("flags")
[16:39:08] <sheilablackrose> didnt work :p
[16:39:34] <coldhead> sheilablackrose: http://jsfiddle.net/RswxD/2/
[16:39:36] <shoky> why .closest('table')
[16:39:39] <coldhead> your html is broken
[16:39:43] <shoky> er
[16:39:47] <coldhead> you are missing <td>s around your table
[16:39:52] <coldhead> <tr><table>
[16:39:54] <coldhead> NOT GOOD
[16:40:31] <sheilablackrose> i know but got no choice
[16:40:38] <sheilablackrose> anywya thats a rough representation
[16:40:50] <sheilablackrose> is there away to access the row above the document table
[16:40:50] <sheilablackrose> ?
[16:41:10] <shoky> .parent() ?
[16:41:14] <shoky> tho..
[16:41:21] <shoky> .closest('tr') ?
[16:41:27] <coldhead> if your question is "how do i make jquery work with my broken html" the answer is "you can't"
[16:41:38] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/RswxD/3/
[16:41:43] <coldhead> the html you pasted is going to be interpreted differently by different browsers
[16:42:06] <coldhead> chrome for example sees <tr><table> and assumes you mean <tr></tr></table><table>
[16:42:14] <coldhead> so the tables aren't even nested
[16:42:25] <coldhead> it's the saddest thing
[16:42:37] <sheilablackrose> coldhead it works in mvc form one view is a table that is called from another view.
[16:42:53] <coldhead> YOU work in mvc form one view
[16:43:22] <sheilablackrose> i cant really recreate the situation in jsfiddle.
[16:43:58] <sheilablackrose> so technically its a nested table thats slides down from the previous tr
[16:44:03] <sheilablackrose> everything works find
[16:44:10] <sheilablackrose> now im just adding a data field to th etr
[16:44:19] <sheilablackrose> n want to adress it from the documnet view
[16:44:30] <shoky> sheilablackrose: fix your html or stop asking
[16:44:53] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/RswxD/3/ i fixed the tds
[16:44:57] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/RswxD/4/
[16:45:04] <coldhead> that works even with the broken TDs
[16:49:15] <sheilablackrose> coldhead
[16:49:18] <sheilablackrose> something lik ethat
[16:49:20] <sheilablackrose> like that
[16:49:24] <sheilablackrose> but the problem is this http://jsfiddle.net/RswxD/5/
[16:49:50] <sheilablackrose> i only want to change the calue of the tr directly above it
[16:50:17] <shoky> .closest('tr[data-flag]')
[16:50:34] <shoky> or closest('tr') ..
[16:50:34] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[16:51:28] <BlaDe^>  /window 2
[16:51:32] <gf3> Awwwwkward
[16:51:57] <otherj> can anyone point me in the right direction with this? i have selectors to which i'm trying to use fileupload and then set the options for each one: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cb3bf64405e96590746e    â€¦ my identifier is wrong for $form
[16:52:36] <shoky> that's not valid javascript, otherj
[16:52:47] <shoky> you have code inside an object literal
[16:54:10] <otherj> not sure if i follow
[16:54:22] <otherj> i mean, i know it's not valid since it errors :P
[16:54:43] <shoky> you have the equivalent of:   var myObj = {x: 5  var wtf = 20; alert('hi'); };
[16:54:52] <shoky> does not make any sense.
[16:55:01] <otherj> hm
[16:55:12] <shoky> also, if  $form is the id ..
[16:55:13] <otherj> well, i'm really jsut trying to get the id of the form inside the div with class fileupload
[16:55:18] <shoky> then you can't to $form.is(..)
[16:55:19] <otherj> and then apply options to that
[16:55:21] <coldhead> sheilablackrose: id-"cashflow' in your markup, thanks for that >: |
[16:55:40] <otherj> this is the first time i've tried to use is
[16:55:48] <shoky> otherj: you don't see what's wrong with your javascript..?
[16:55:53] <shoky> otherj: then you need to learn javascript
[16:56:04] <otherj> i do sort of see it
[16:56:09] <otherj> i'm not sure how to do it properly
[16:56:16] <otherj> but thanks for the helpful suggestion, shoky
[16:56:38] <shoky> do what properly?
[16:56:49] <sheilablackrose> coldhead similar to the code you wrote but that would effect all row that has the data value flag right
[16:57:05] <gf3> *affect
[16:59:08] <coldhead> i don't know what kind of abomination you're working with but if i were you i'd fix the markup so you can do what you need to do with a single line of jQuery using closest() and without all this ID nonsense and broken HTML
[16:59:29] <coldhead> and if i couldn't change the html i would go get violently drunk and hit up the casino
[16:59:47] <coldhead> this is doomsday stuff
[17:00:06] <sheilablackrose> lol
[17:00:06] <otherj> haha
[17:00:33] <coldhead> hey ogk1000
[17:00:35] <ogk1000> plz take a look at these 2 lines of code... has to be a better way? http://collabedit.com/h66u4
[17:00:40] <ogk1000> sup coldhead
[17:00:40] <coldhead> sorry about yesterday
[17:00:45] <ogk1000> what for?
[17:01:09] <ogk1000> I made a hackery version of responsive for our site, can I PM you the link
[17:01:10] <coldhead> i don't know, maybe something bad happened
[17:01:25] <coldhead> ogk1000: .closest('.someclass') is way better than multiple .parent()s
[17:01:43] <coldhead> my mother says i'm not allowed to do PMs because of paedophiles
[17:01:44] <ogk1000> is there a way to control fwd or prev in the dom tho?
[17:01:45] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[17:01:50] <ogk1000> closest may go fwd but I want it to go back
[17:01:57] <ogk1000> cooleo
[17:02:00] <coldhead> .closest('.someclass').nextAll('.aids')
[17:02:24] <coldhead> closest() goes UP
[17:02:29] <coldhead> find() goes DOWN
[17:02:41] <coldhead> nextAll() and prevAll() go through siblings
[17:03:01] <shoky> otherj: i suppose maybe you wanted something more like this  http://pastebin.com/nGgvs7L6
[17:03:21] <coldhead> ogk1000: we could be much more helpful if we could see the html you're traversing
[17:03:53] <shoky> otherj: actually.. isn't the .fileupload element the form itself
[17:04:22] <ogk1000> coldhead, you might get overwhelmed
[17:04:23] <otherj> ooh, i get what you were saying much more clearly now
[17:04:25] <ogk1000> http://ogkey.com/s3/
[17:04:35] <otherj> shoky, the form is inside a div with class fileupload
[17:04:45] <ogk1000> so if u click first select your hardware then click a link youll see its working just lotsa parents
[17:04:54] <shoky> otherj: oks
[17:05:12] <EasyAt> Any recomendations for a lightweight charting library?  There's so many it is tough to choose
[17:05:59] <EasyAt> http://i41.tinypic.com/2d75u9c.png I'd be doing something similar to this
[17:06:26] <coldhead> if someone wants to help ogk1000 with his traversal i have to talk to a jerk about a thing
[17:06:32] <coldhead> brb
[17:07:26] <abjorn> what did i do this time coldhead
[17:09:04] <raj> why does jquery 1.9 no longer accept untrimmed strings of html?
[17:09:08] <raj> to turn into a jquery object
[17:10:22] <shoky> ogk1000 you can try .closest('#ogk-co > ul > li')
[17:10:36] <shoky> ogk1000:  but it's best to put classes on things and use .closest('.className')
[17:10:50] <ogk1000> $(this).closest('div.accToggle').click(); seemed to work on some but not all
[17:11:27] <shoky> cause not all of them have a div.accToggle ancestors
[17:12:07] <shoky> or, it doesnt have the class a the time it's clicked
[17:12:11] <shoky> at*
[17:12:19] <otherj> thanks, shoky, by the way
[17:14:59] <ogk1000> shoky, how about this.. on that URL if u scroll down the sidebar follows u... plz scroll until it docks to bottom... if u refresh the page it resets to top... how can I best detect if not scroll top then move to position?
[17:17:35] <shoky> ogk1000: you mean how to persist the state between browser refreshes?
[17:17:41] <ogk1000> sure
[17:17:58] <ogk1000> or on load I guess I need a detect if not scroll top = 0 then fire the function
[17:18:00] <shoky> ogk1000: well.. there are tons of ways to persist stuff.. on the server side, on the client side...
[17:18:07] <shoky> cookies.. localStorage..
[17:18:13] <ogk1000> ok how about a more simpler note
[17:18:30] <ogk1000> the second option.. now choose your glass thicknesss ... u see when u toggle it it has a jerk? any idea how to fix
[17:19:36] <shoky> adunno, dont feel like digging into it
[17:22:07] <ogk1000> all good I figured it out
[17:22:22] <ogk1000> apparently its bad to have padding or margin on the slideToggle element .. it should be on the children only
[17:22:38] <ogk1000> thx for your input tho
[17:24:01] <ogk1000> so thats good for everyone to know on the slide jerk
[17:24:03] <ogk1000> I see it happen a lot
[17:25:03] <shoky> yea it's usually some annoying css thing
[17:27:06] <zduffy> I am looking to see if a value is selected. Is this the correct syntax? ($("select[name='TravelTime']").val() = 69)
[17:27:48] <shoky> zduffy:  ===
[17:30:12] <jrockjiggz> ====
[17:30:20] <jrockjiggz> ==== is better than ===
[17:30:35] <jrockjiggz> fyi
[17:30:52] <ogk1000> really?
[17:30:53] <zduffy> Hmm. Still not working shoky
[17:31:19] <shoky> zduffy: seems fine to me.
[17:31:49] <shoky> zduffy: the === was meant to replace only the 2nd =  in your code..
[17:32:31] <zduffy> i know. I know have, if (($("select[name='TravelTime']").val() === 69)){
[17:32:49] <zduffy> and yes I have a closing } lol
[17:33:04] <shoky> ok, redundant (  ) also
[17:33:09] <shoky> anyway , looks fine.
[17:34:42] <shoky> oh actually
[17:34:53] <shoky> maybe == would be better here
[17:35:01] <zduffy> ok let me try that
[17:35:03] <shoky> or === '69'
[17:35:07] <shoky> or parseInt  the value
[17:35:16] <shoky> because the .val() is a string
[17:36:22] <zduffy> shoky: if (($("select[name='TravelTime']").val() === '69')){ still does not work
[17:36:43] <shoky> zduffy:  make a jsfiddle
[17:37:23] <jrockjiggz> parseInt('69',10); //int(69(
[17:37:25] <jrockjiggz> parseInt('69',10); //int(69)
[17:37:44] <Ziggy`> It's nice to see that people specify the radix!
[17:38:13] <Ziggy`> +1 jrockjiggz
[17:38:18] <abstortedminds> how do i get the get last number in a string in javascript thats not a space
[17:39:03] <Ziggy`> abstortedminds: Give us an example and the result you'd like.
[17:39:22] <Ziggy`> abstortedminds: What's the string that is.
[17:39:42] <abstortedminds> the string is like this:
[17:39:50] <abstortedminds> 1      [tons of spaces]
[17:39:55] <abstortedminds> 2 [tons of spaces]
[17:40:10] <abstortedminds> continues
[17:40:20] <Ziggy`> I see.
[17:40:21] <abstortedminds> i want the last number to
[17:40:26] <Ziggy`> I'll put a fiddle up
[17:40:29] <abstortedminds> thanks man!
[17:44:51] <shoky> ?eval '1   55     876   '.match(/\d+/g).slice(-1)[0]
[17:44:53] <bot-t> shoky: "876"
[17:45:37] <tomo> How to detect scroll event only for the current page?
[17:45:48] <Ziggy`> abstortedminds: http://pastie.org/6091970
[17:46:13] <Ziggy`> abstortedminds: pure js that is.
[17:46:26] <abstortedminds> ok lemme test
[17:49:37] <aghouseh> hey, anyone want to lend me a hand with intercepting the .showErrors() method in jquery.validate()?
[17:49:49] <coldhead> Letâ€™s customize your door, shall we?
[17:49:55] <coldhead> riveting stuff, ogk1000
[17:50:07] <aghouseh> im trying to run my own little check before firing the default method, but im having a hard time figuring the right methodology
[17:50:33] <abstortedminds> this worked: var lastItem = responseText.match(/\d+/g).slice(-1)[0];
[17:50:41] <ogk1000> huh
[17:51:44] <aghouseh> http://pastebin.com/QN1iuDx3
[17:52:26] <aghouseh> is that the right track? i keep getting _showErrors is undefined
[17:52:57] <coldhead> so cold
[17:59:42] * coldhead np: hella - headless
[18:07:49] <Ziggy`> aghouseh: http://jsfiddle.net/vk8MB/ -> maybe something like this
[18:07:57] <coldhead> strange tools
[18:08:02] <Ziggy`> aghouseh: I'm no expert though.
[18:08:26] <aghouseh> ahh nice yea that seems ok
[18:08:43] <aghouseh> i actually found a method in jq validate to call the base showErrors method
[18:08:59] <aghouseh> showErrors: { this.defaultShowErrors(); }
[18:09:07] <aghouseh> but thanks for that.. will be helpful im sure :)
[18:09:30] <Ziggy`> aghouseh: Yeah, that's just a basic example how you could do it.
[18:09:36] <aghouseh> nod thx
[18:13:09] <CodeFriar> whats the best way to itterate over an array of objects and rename or add properties on the object ?
[18:16:14] <raj> CodeFriar, $.each()
[18:16:25] <CodeFriar> raj: I tried that
[18:16:29] <raj> and?
[18:16:45] <CodeFriar> doesn't affect my objects
[18:16:50] <CodeFriar> here let me fiddle it
[18:22:20] <CodeFriar> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/zQFKG/
[18:23:46] <raj> CodeFriar, `n` is the index
[18:23:50] <raj> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[18:27:53] <CodeFriar> raj: got it! how can I delete a property?
[18:31:02] <coldhead> delete thing.aids;
[18:32:57] <CodeFriar> coldhead: I only asked, because that makes the other properties null
[18:33:28] <coldhead> oh dear
[18:33:50] <CodeFriar> coldhead: I do n.text = n.Name; delete n.Name;
[18:33:58] <CodeFriar> seems that makes n.text undefined
[18:35:02] <shoky> CodeFriar: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/zQFKG/2/
[18:39:35] <CodeFriar> shoky that makes everything undefined here
[18:50:18] <kalizga> hi guys, i suppose i should sniff for user-agent on the server and load 1.9 for old IEs and 2.x for others?
[18:52:07] <coldhead> kalizga: IE conditional comments would be better for that surely
[18:52:24] <kalizga> coldhead: ah, didn't think about those ..  thanks
[18:54:19] <kalizga> but, hmmm ..    that'll load both versions in other browsers (?)
[18:54:44] <kalizga> they ignore the IE conditional comments
[18:55:50] <garbagecollectio> how can i bind jquery to every keydown even and do an action, say hit an api, and then spit out another character
[18:55:54] <garbagecollectio> like if i wanted like the a key to spit out an s
[18:55:59] <garbagecollectio> or the a key to hit an api that returned what key to output
[18:56:22] <coldhead> kalizga: http://www.impressivewebs.com/loading-different-jquery-version-ie6-8/
[18:57:27] <kalizga> clever
[18:57:29] <kalizga> thanks
[18:58:52] <coldhead> garbagecollectio: $(document).bind('keyup', ...
[18:58:57] <coldhead> will catch all the keys for you
[18:59:01] <coldhead> but as to what to do with them
[18:59:04] <coldhead> it's a little trickier
[18:59:15] <garbagecollectio> like how would i get s key to input
[18:59:19] <coldhead> you'd need to use e.target to find where the typing orrcured
[18:59:20] <garbagecollectio> the letter l
[18:59:28] <coldhead> e.which will let you match a char
[18:59:45] <coldhead> if (e.which === 64)
[18:59:54] <garbagecollectio> right
[18:59:57] <garbagecollectio> but how do i switch
[18:59:58] <garbagecollectio> keys
[19:00:03] <coldhead> that's where it's hard
[19:00:20] <coldhead> you have to find the element that was being typed in
[19:00:30] <coldhead> and insert your alternate character
[19:00:31] <coldhead> somehow
[19:21:25] <vedic> I have created custom namespace for storing global variable. var $.cityNames = {name: [a, b, c], region: [d, e, f]} but I get syntax error

[19:42:32] <relipse> i'm trying to implement http://sandbox.scriptiny.com/table-sorter/ but i'm getting a javascript error in chrome, what is the problem?
[19:45:11] <tw2113> what does the error say
[19:45:17] <relipse>  does anyone have an alternative solution to get crazy awesome tables like this: http://sandbox.scriptiny.com/table-sorter/
[19:47:05] <tw2113> try debugging the error first relipse
[19:47:13] <tw2113> instead of trying to find a replacement already
[19:51:07] <relipse> tw2113: i fixed the error but then another error popped up
[19:51:11] <relipse> its stupid dealing with it
[19:52:10] <tw2113> so...keep fixing
[19:57:41] <relipse> http://www.csstablegenerator.com/
[19:57:45] <relipse> just used that
[20:05:55] <raj> ever since updating to jquery-ui 1.10 from 1.8, the close button has disappeared
[20:06:13] <raj> I used to just have it as the letter 'X'

[20:35:08] <coldhead> rebel_yell_all: can you do a working demo at jsfiddle?
[20:35:48] <rebel_yell_all> nvm
[20:35:53] <rebel_yell_all> i fixed it
[20:36:00] <rebel_yell_all> thanks anyway coldhead
[20:36:44] <coldhead> that's the best kind of fix, rebel_yell_all
[20:36:49] <coldhead> the kind that comes from the heart
[20:36:52] <coldhead> great work, have fun
[20:40:41] <rebel_yell_all> hahaha thanks
[20:40:44] <rebel_yell_all> well i sort of fixed it
[20:40:53] <rebel_yell_all> now its only working on the first modal
[20:41:31] <coldhead> demo?
[20:45:11] <rebel_yell_all> fixed it again
[20:45:12] <rebel_yell_all> lol
[20:46:03] <coldhead> you have my favourite bugs, rebel_yell_all
[20:46:08] <coldhead> the ones i don't even have to look at
[20:46:11] <coldhead> keep them coming

[20:47:28] <amh345> im trying to get some content from a class $('.some_class').html();    and then prepend it to another div.  i dont know what's happened in jquery 1.9 but if there is any spaces between the elements of .some_class, jquery freaks out with "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression:"   the end result is i need to have everything on a single line :/    is there a new way in 1.9 to capture the content of an element
[20:47:28] <amh345> and prependTo another element?
[20:48:43] <khurram> hi everyone
[20:48:54] <khurram> some thing new for me
[20:48:58] <khurram> i have  div box of 200 x 200 , i want to display text in it of max 300 characters  i.e. If the text is more the font size deceases and fills the box  else if the text is less the font size should increase to fill the box. Can some one please throw light on this thanks

[20:50:59] <khurram> amh345: thanks
[20:51:17] <coldhead> amh345: can you do a demo of the broken behaviour on jsfiddle?
[20:51:24] <coldhead> if it's really broken people will be very upset
[20:52:07] <amh345> coldhead: ok, i will try to mock it up.  im very upset. my entire upgrade is pooched. i was hoping this was something that was just done differently.   in any case i wil mock up
[20:52:10] <amh345> one moment.
[20:53:31] <coldhead> it sounds like something that shouldn't have brokenb
[20:53:43] <coldhead> as in unit tests would have cared
[20:57:30] <amh345> coldhead:  http://jsfiddle.net/RAQvC/
[20:57:38] <amh345> err typo. one sec
[20:57:54] <amh345> here http://jsfiddle.net/RAQvC/1/
[20:57:58] <amh345> coldhead:  ^
[20:58:33] <amh345> i dont know if im doing this totally wrong.. but it's worked in every previous version of jquery.
[21:01:54] <ngharo> thats weird yo
[21:02:04] <amh345> what i posted?
[21:03:02] <ngharo> yea
[21:03:23] <amh345> ok, so im not insane.
[21:04:43] <ngharo> you can just $('.some_content').prependTo('.content_drop'); tho
[21:07:03] <amh345> ugh.   i have to do a lot of tweaking if that's the case.
[21:07:07] <amh345> is this a feature or a bug
[21:07:11] <amh345> 'feature'
[21:07:23] <ngharo> seems buggy if the behaviour changed
[21:07:28] <ngharo> although i havent been keeping up on changelogs
[21:07:45] <coldhead> amh345: let's take this to #jQuery-dev
[21:07:49] <amh345> i just upgraded my framework, and it packs with 1.9.
[21:08:09] <amh345> coldhead: ill pop over there.. but im not good enough at jquery to really 'say' anything.
[21:08:15] <amh345> but ill watch if you want to tell them.
[21:16:33] <coldhead> amh345: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13223
[21:16:38] <coldhead> apparently that's "not a bug"
[21:17:48] <coldhead> amh345: apparently you want $( $.parseHTML(get_content) )
[21:18:17] <amh345> oh man
[21:18:45] <coldhead> here is there "why we're not just being dicks" official explanation http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-htmlstring-versus-jquery-selectorstring
[21:18:52] <coldhead> thanks for bringing this to my attention amh345
[21:19:48] <amh345> i spent an hour trying to figure out what the hell was going on with this.   it was buried deep within some serverside.  i assumed it wasnt jQuery.. because hell, why would they screw with it..
[21:19:50] <amh345> oh well.
[21:19:52] <coldhead> amh345: the jQuery migrate plugin will fix it for you in the short term
[21:20:24] <coldhead> it's pretty sad that it breaks in this case, wher eyou KNOW the code is valid html because you just got it OUT of the DOM
[21:20:34] <coldhead> rather than it being some malicious string from a script kiddy
[21:20:58] <amh345> yeah.   im trying to decide if i should take things back to 1.8.   probably a bad idea if this is the way it's going to be moving forward.
[21:21:27] <amh345> i wonder what other surprises ill find.  lulz
[21:23:13] <coldhead> amh345: at this stage i am planning on sticking with 1.8 and friends until all these annoying things are fixed
[21:34:31] <amh345> oh hey.  jquery 1.8 made everything work i thinkim going to follow your lead coldhead. 1.8 for the forseeable future.

[21:40:28] <vedic> dblosevn: prefix match

[21:42:43] <Cork> vedic: run a filter over the array where you match the string from the textfield with the beginning of the string in the array cropped at the length on the input text
[21:43:32] <vedic> Cork: ready function? If nothing then only would prefer to write of my own
[21:45:27] <Cork> vedic: there is array.some
[21:45:37] <Cork> vedic: if your ok with a ie8> dependency
[21:45:44] <Cork> (all other browsers support it)
[21:45:52] <dblosevn> or var mRegex = new regExp('^' + 'vancover', 'i'); $.each(yourarray, function () {if (mRegex.test(this)) { //dosomething });
[21:46:22] <Cork> dblosevn: i think he wants to find the one that matches
[21:46:40] <Cork> but ya, $.map could do it
[21:46:48] <dblosevn> the one that matches will eval true in the if block
[21:47:02] <Cork> dblosevn: i meant i think he wants to get it returned
[21:47:05] <Cork> not handled in a loop
[21:47:21] <Cork> but i'm only guessing :)
[21:47:48] <dblosevn> doesnt .map just interate the array ?
[21:47:58] <Cork> nope
[21:48:26] <Cork> var mRegex = new regExp('^' + 'vancover', 'i'); var matches = $.map(yourarray, function () { return mRegex.test(this); });
[21:49:12] <dblosevn> so it does iterate the array just returns an array of matches
[21:49:22] <Cork> ya
[21:49:42] <Cork> if you want compatibility with ie8 and down there isn't really an option
[21:49:43] <vedic> Cork, dblosevn: var array = $.grep(array, function(value) {
[21:49:43] <vedic>     return value.indexOf('1') < 0;
[21:49:44] <vedic> });
[21:49:55] <dblosevn> ?$.grep
[21:49:57] <bot-t> dblosevn, jQuery.grep() | jQuery API Documentation - Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[21:50:03] <dblosevn> seriously lol
[21:50:19] <Cork> dblosevn: that does the same thing as $.map except it returns the value you return in the function
[21:50:32] <Cork> instead of the original value if you return true
[21:50:48] <dblosevn> doesnt satisfy his question though he needs the index in the array
[21:51:29] <Cork> oh
[21:52:12] <Cork> then it becomes a little bit trickier
[21:52:29] <Cork> indexOf on arrays has the same limitation as .some/.filter
[21:52:54] <Cork> so a for loop might be the best option then
[21:54:25] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/54
[21:55:23] <Cork> dblosevn: its better to use for, as you don't need the scope
[21:57:13] <Yathit> How to remove published plugin?
[21:57:29] <Yathit> I happen to created two namespace for my plugin.
[22:00:11] <dblosevn> ok then lol http://dblosevn.chosd.com/55
[22:03:12] <dblosevn> Yathit: proablly better to ask that in #jquery-dev
[22:04:39] <Yathit> thanks.
[22:28:24] <maxmoore14> can someone help with a dynamic navbar? I'm having formatting issues
[22:50:29] <rakl> is this correct syntax?
[22:50:30] <rakl> $.post("/sessions", email: @get('loginName'), password: @get('loginPassword'))
[22:50:39] <rakl> (in coffeescript)
[22:50:51] <Cork> no
[22:50:56] <Cork> ah, coffie
[22:51:00] <rakl> saw it in another project, but I'm trying to use it and it doesn't send those as params
[22:51:04] <danheberden> how would that even work
[22:51:16] <tw2113> unicorn blood
[22:51:22] <Cork> rakl: i think coffee needs {} too
[22:51:22] <danheberden> shouldn't it still be an obj?
[22:51:25] <rakl> not sure, but it's being used in a bit project
[22:51:43] <Cork> rakl: if it at all parses it works in coffee
[22:51:51] <danheberden> { email: @get('loginname'), password: @get('loginPassword') );
[22:52:01] <danheberden> }
[22:52:01] <Cork> danheberden: you missed the closing :)
[22:52:04] <danheberden> GODDAMNIT
[22:52:09] <rakl> :p
[22:52:15] <tw2113> go to the back of the line danheberden !
[22:52:24] <danheberden> but it's so lonely there
[22:52:39] <danheberden> the back of the queue is a sad place indeed!
[22:52:39] <tw2113> well you should have thought of that before you missed the closing
[22:52:45] <rakl> well it traslates correctly to a hash in js
[22:52:51] <rakl> i mean object
[22:53:10] <rakl> but i didn't know that was how you could send data in a $.post?

[22:53:50] <ptihiy> hi, guys. how I can delay function flow in JS (if I want on some occasion to pause function, but not fire another with SetTimeout)?
[22:54:54] <Cork> ptihiy: you can't stop the execution in js
[22:55:00] <Cork> if you do you frees the browser
[22:55:13] <coldhead> debugger; // ??
[22:55:31] <Cork> it still freeses the browser to some extent :)
[23:00:53] <ptihiy> ok, I understood. thanks)
[23:19:01] <the_dark_knight> Hi, how do I append / add an <option> to <select> . I have id, value and text of this <option> . This shouldn't add duplicate ids to select. In case of duplicate id, it should ignore the append. Please help.
[23:56:30] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone enlighten me how to console.log the dynamic price? If you change the options the price in pink changes, via js. I can't seem to grab this dynamic value and console.log it?
