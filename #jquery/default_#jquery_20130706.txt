[00:34:54] <fatmandown> I have a pretty large html form I need to pass all the values (using .post) to a php script- serialize() would be the best way to do so, yes?
[00:35:51] <Propheteus> hi all
[00:36:22] <Propheteus> is it possible for an admin to sent instant notification for users ??
[00:38:04] <codephobic> hi
[00:39:20] <codephobic> I'm just getting into jquery and jquery-ui, and I'm trying to make an app that uses the datepicker utility to get a booking date from the user.
[00:40:51] <codephobic> so far, everything's pretty straightforward but, I'm actually at a loss for how to change the style of it, I can't find the relevant settings on the theme roller page (@ jquery-ui), for table width, height, cell padding, colour, background etc ... I can only find font and a selection of other variable settings.
[00:59:41] <fatmandown> I have a pretty large html form I need to pass all the values (using .post) to a php script- serialize() would be the best way to do so, yes?
[00:59:49] <fatmandown> I'm pretty unclear as to how to use it
[01:01:19] <aro> why
[01:01:25] <aro> why would you use serialize to post
[01:01:28] <aro> oh
[01:01:33] <aro> derp im in jquery not ##php
[01:01:47] <aro> yes, serialize would work well
[01:10:33] <codephobic> I'm just getting into jquery and jquery-ui, and I'm trying to make an app that uses the datepicker utility to get a booking date from the user.

I can only find font and a selection of other variable settings.
[01:47:28] <aro> can jquery handle redirects on POST?
[02:05:23] <mrHAT> ok, so i get large amount of data back from an ajax request and this is the way i handle it and insert into the dom : http://pastebin.com/HLVTxpnN
[02:05:58] <mrHAT> i dont know if this will affect perfromance a lot since about 100 rows will be added at a time
[02:06:53] <mrHAT> iterating trough the json response and constructing that large string which is then appended on each loop is what i'm afraid of
[02:20:44] <ph88> hi mrHAT
[02:21:33] <mrHAT> yes?
[02:21:36] <ph88> hello
[02:21:49] <ph88> how are you ?
[02:22:32] <ph88> that is some realy ugly code you made :D
[02:23:01] <mrHAT> who the hell cares about ugly
[02:23:39] <ph88> performance, maintainability ... who cares indeed ...
[02:24:16] <mrHAT> and how exactly would you make that "more maintainable"
[02:24:28] <ph88> use a templating engine
[02:24:38] <mrHAT> and that is why i asked earlier... is there anyway i can improove performance
[02:24:50] <ph88> yes performance i have another suggestion
[02:25:04] <mrHAT> and how a template engine will improove performance :)
[02:25:30] <mrHAT> it does the same thing of what i did but it will wrap it in a nice beaufifull hundred lines of code
[02:25:55] <mrHAT> tell me about performance
[02:26:31] <ph88> the template engine is for maintainability, not performance
[02:27:03] <ph88> ye about performance it depends how many $.each() you have
[02:27:18] <mrHAT> there is only 1
[02:27:29] <mrHAT> which will loop trough an array with 100 elements
[02:27:53] <mrHAT> which have only 1 level so i wont go deep
[02:28:16] <ph88> oh 100 is a lot
[02:28:28] <ph88> and you change the dom on every loop ... this will be sloooow
[02:29:26] <mrHAT> 0.002s on a really slow machine
[02:29:48] <mrHAT> core2 duo @ 1.6mhz
[02:30:00] <ph88> ok then you are all good
[02:30:10] <mrHAT> how slow are you talking about and why you said it
[02:30:17] <mrHAT> not from expiriance i guess
[02:30:32] <ph88> how do you guess ?
[02:30:38] <ravenzz> ..
[02:31:20] <mrHAT> lol
[02:32:14] <turkish> is there a channel for programming technics in general ?
[02:32:14] <mrHAT> all i get when asking something is about the damn scalability and maintainance
[02:32:21] <turkish> such as how to implement a tree
[02:33:06] <ravenzz> turkish there is plenty of articles, posts and examples in the internet
[02:33:11] <mrHAT> that is why most web apps out there have layers over layers of templating and caching sistems which in the end just throw up
[02:33:19] <ph88> "i dont know if this will affect perfromance a lot since about 100 rows will be added at a time"   -----  "0.002s on a really slow machine  core2 duo @ 1.6mhz"   LoL
[02:33:38] <turkish> yeah i know, i have a specifig question and irc seems often good for these thing
[02:34:07] <ph88> turkish: ##programming
[02:34:13] <ravenzz> turkish try #web or maybe there is a #algorithms or #datastructures or programming channel
[02:34:19] <ravenzz> use your immagination
[02:34:39] <turkish> ok thx :D
[02:35:04] <mrHAT> ph88 i did no testing at the time of question
[02:35:24] <mrHAT> i did a quick question which ended up in nothing
[02:35:31] <ph88> maybe you should do some testing before you come ask questions
[02:36:19] <mrHAT> ravenzz for example just jumped in saying switch should not be used
[02:36:21] <mrHAT> lol
[02:36:47] <mrHAT> avoid switch ? no proper answer when i asked why
[02:38:46] <ravenzz> <ravenzz> what if you have hundred of conditions?
[02:39:11] <ravenzz> implies maintainability
[02:39:18] <mrHAT> how did you knew that
[02:39:54] <mrHAT> what is the largest project you worked on that needed maintainability of this type
[02:43:36] <mrHAT> how many of the projects you are working on will actually change ? does it worth putting extra work and weight on something that can be done in a few lines of code ?
[02:44:00] <ravenzz> the codebase of the startup I work for is pretty huge, an object can grow as much as it is needed and you don't have to care about all that crap/deal with headaches
[02:44:24] <ravenzz> mrHAT it is not extra work for me. It is a matter of mindset
[02:44:27] <mrHAT> how many work on this project
[02:45:04] <ravenzz> using your switch and super concatenation is definitely not easier
[02:45:20] <ravenzz> it is confusing you can miss some quotes or forget to escape stuff
[02:45:56] <mrHAT> and how is that not going to show up when testing
[02:46:10] <ravenzz> but, again, if you're happy with it... I won't stop you
[02:49:50] <ph88> mrHAT: i made something for you
[02:50:10] <mrHAT> ?
[02:50:39] <ph88> here for you: http://pastebin.com/0g1F5eBy
[02:51:41] <ph88> you like it ??
[02:54:40] <mrHAT> w8
[02:55:49] <mrHAT> it looks more elegant
[02:56:42] <mrHAT> but i really won´t implement a templating sistem for a few ajax requests that i need to display and that will never ever change
[02:57:23] <ph88> ah im glad you like it :D
[02:58:25] <ph88> should be faster too
[03:00:01] <mrHAT> one question i have trough.. when you implement a lot of code that have many dependencies that in the future will not be suported or they will just break because they have too much stuff thats no longer supported.. who will have the headache then
[03:00:54] <ph88> yeah suppose jQuery will no longer be supported ... all the internet will have a headache :(
[03:01:41] <mrHAT> i'm talking about templating sistems
[03:01:46] <ph88> ah right
[03:01:54] <mrHAT> jquery is much too large to fall
[03:02:33] <mrHAT> and other libraries that i've seen containing deprecated stuff
[03:03:14] <ph88> why would it break though ? if you just download the library you can always use it with your project no problem
[03:17:30] <mrHAT> ph88 > Error: TypeError: n is null Source File: underscore-min.js Line: 1
[03:17:41] <mrHAT> debug that
[03:17:53] <ph88> you debug it
[03:18:26] <mrHAT> underscore.js was not developed by me.. where the hell do i know
[03:18:34] <mrHAT> exactly my earlier point
[03:19:09] <ph88> oh you don't like to learn new things ... ok i see your point
[03:20:16] <mrHAT> now i need to pass trough every single stuff on the internet and understand what the hell they did that is not fun
[03:21:19] <mrHAT> that error is because the stupid underscore way of parsing has not seen yet the template and it just thowd a nonsense error
[03:23:40] <ph88> the script that you had before worked too ... so you don't need to do this ...
[03:24:27] <mrHAT> you are acting childish
[03:26:12] <ph88> well you didn't thank me for the work i did for you and you complain about not having fun and not understanding errors ....  if it's so much trouble to you then your old script is a very good alternative ...

[03:50:42] <ajph> hi. is there any way i can get something like this to work? http://jsfiddle.net/SUgAe/
[03:52:47] <ajph> i think it should be quite simple
[03:54:21] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/SUgAe/1/
[04:00:51] <ajph> grafi: the test case doesn't reflect that the string is built in a loop and i need to make changes during this loop. applying the change directly won't work. is there another way?
[04:01:42] <grafi> not off the top of my head
[04:07:55] <ph88> ajph: http://jsfiddle.net/SUgAe/2/
[04:09:09] <ph88> if you do $(str)  ... it will make a new object  from str ... it will not change str itself .... so you need to save that object into a variable
[04:09:24] <ajph> ph88: i see. thats great thank you
[04:09:25] <ph88> then also find() is only for children ... but since you only have 1 div you need to do filter()
[04:09:30] <ph88> np
[04:09:57] <ph88> <div id="stuff"><div id="test">changed</div></div>
[04:10:01] <ph88> this is the result btw
[04:22:57] <ajph> ph88: is test still a string
[04:23:35] <ph88> ajph:  no it's a jQuery object  ... what kind of string would you like ?
[04:24:04] <ph88> i think if you put jQuery object into html() it will be used as if it were a string though ...
[04:25:05] <ajph> ah http://jsfiddle.net/SUgAe/4/
[04:28:20] <ph88> good job :)
[04:55:15] <liebsoer> good morning :)

[07:20:08] <MrS1lentcz> Hello, i have any troubles with children method. look on this code: http://pastebin.com/LdGD0Fx6 how is it possible? :( why is code in first line not working?...
[07:23:47] <sammich> MrS1lentcz: that's because children only gets the immediate children, not any further down the tree
[07:24:02] <sammich> you'll want 'find' for all decendants
[07:24:18] <sammich> the children would be the 'td
[07:24:33] <sammich> the children of the td would be your input
[07:24:50] <MrS1lentcz> sammich: i see...
[07:38:33] <daslicht> how do i do something like this : $("div").children("input")
[07:38:44] <daslicht> so it returns all <input elements ?
[07:42:36] <codecrazy> function show_x1(data){ $('#x1').html(data); $('#loadinggif').show(); update_f2(); $('#loadinggif').hide()); }
[07:43:41] <codecrazy> executing update_f2() takes some time so i am trying to show a loading animation while it executes like this, but it never shows up.. i even tried adding a delay like $('#loadinggif').hide().delay(900)); to no avail
[07:44:48] <daslicht> solved

[08:20:57] <piers> yeah i just don't know where to put the if, i just started learning js/jquery
[08:21:06] <piers> like this perhaps?
[08:21:07] <piers> for(var i in data){   if (data[i] == 3) {     $('aside').append('<h2>' + i + '</h2>' + '<p>' + data[i] + '</p>');   } }  could it be something like that?
[08:24:24] <piers> think http://codepen.io/piers/pen/20ee5c7ae2b6125697b170c072f827ed works

[11:08:57] <thebloggu> can someone explain to me how to do a get request with basic authentication in query? i tried various alternatives but none seem to work http://pastebin.com/3tww9SZx
[11:10:02] <Kolorbon>  Hello ;) I work with GreaseMonkey on a script, and I want to run a function, when an event of the website gets called. What would be the best way to do that?
[11:19:52] <ph88> yes Kolorbon you asked that before ... maybe show some code
[11:22:31] <Kolorbon> ph88, yes, but nobody answered... Why do you need code for this? There is an click-mousemove listener on the website, and everytime, when it gets called, i want to run a function.
[11:30:59] <ph88> Kolorbon: i think you can just make another function to listen to the same event
[11:31:38] <SinnerNyx> ok, I think I've come across a bug in jQuery, or else I'm seriously misunderstanding something about the data function. With the data function notice how I assign "test-bool" inside the onready function. http://jsbin.com/uzecoq/3/edit
[11:32:00] <SinnerNyx> In the live preview if you click on the title twice it gives you "Second click... or is it ?!". This works fine
[11:32:12] <SinnerNyx> however, if you go to http://jsbin.com/uzecoq/5/edit
[11:32:47] <SinnerNyx> You'll notice the only difference is I use an object to assign the value of 'test-bool', you have to click 3 times on the <h1> for it to show the message.
[11:32:58] <SinnerNyx> Can someone confirm that this is in fact the case and I didn't just get this wrong?
[11:40:22] <ph88> SinnerNyx:  it's not a key value pair anymore ... data() is an object now ... this is to be expected
[11:40:49] <ph88> SinnerNyx:  here fixed it for ya http://jsfiddle.net/8baBd/
[11:40:59] <ionico> hi,  i have many divs,  inside an input and a checkbox,  how can i sum all the inputs on wich the checkbox is checked??
[11:41:28] <SinnerNyx> http://api.jquery.com/data/ the second overload seems like it takes an object with key-value pairs. Am I misunderstanding this overload?
[11:41:28] <ph88> sum ??
[11:41:37] <SinnerNyx> ph88: ^
[11:42:00] <dopie> argh
[11:42:08] <ph88> SinnerNyx:  you are using this one http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-obj
[11:42:27] <ph88> hey dopie, showdown ! :p
[11:42:50] <dopie> ph88 yeah im getting beat up with it
[11:42:54] <SinnerNyx> ph88, thats the one I'm referring too.. so.. what am I misunderstanding?
[11:42:56] <dopie> im trying to do custom extensions
[11:43:25] <slopjong> should I use .on( "click", function(){}); instead of click(function(){}); ?
[11:43:37] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/5940826
[11:43:40] <ph88> SinnerNyx: you are trying to access the data as if it were a key, value pair ... but you put in an object.  So the assumption here is that data() will do the conversion between object <---> key/value pair .... but i don't see that working ....
[11:43:44] <dopie> thats the error I get when I hit web console
[11:44:30] <ph88> slopjong: click() is a conveniance function ... so it's actually just what you prefer
[11:45:00] <SinnerNyx> ph88, I'm really confused. Sorry. It seems to be setting the data correctly when I do alert($('h1').data('test-bool')), it shows "false" rather then undefined.. so how is my key/value pair incorrect? How would I do it the way they do it? What is the difference between an object and a key/value pair?
[11:45:42] <slopjong> ph88, I was told that click would be deprecated in the future but I couldn't find any information on this, so if click() won't drop I continue to use it
[11:46:27] <dopie> ph88,  any awesome help here??
[11:46:29] <ph88> SinnerNyx:  im not that knowlegable that i know the finer details of it ...
[11:46:50] <ph88> slopjong: okay
[11:47:33] <ph88> dopie:  i don't know about showdown :(  i just like the word :D
[11:51:21] <ph88> SinnerNyx: why not look at the jQuery code for this ? might be enlightening ^^
[11:51:53] <SinnerNyx> ph88, good call, I'll have to do that when I have a moment. I thought for sure this is a bug.
[11:53:53] <libin> hello everyone. I have got to call a url, which return me a json.how can i get a value of the json that i have recieved
[11:53:57] <libin> this is the url
[11:54:00] <libin> http://api.zoom.it/v1/content/?url=http://www.incredibleindia.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kerala.jpg
[11:56:26] <ph88> libin:  do you try with $.ajax() ?
[11:57:00] <libin>  yes
[11:57:02] <libin> http://textdump.net/read/2456/
[11:57:10] <libin> this is wat i have done so far
[11:58:18] <libin> i can get the json to the client side.. but a bit confused about how to extract the required value
[11:58:21] <ph88> where is the ajax function ?
[11:59:06] <libin> why do i need an ajax function?
[11:59:35] <ph88> well ... it works .. maybe there is another way. ... i just asked, you say yes it's there ... but i can't see it
[11:59:55] <ph88> by the way .get()   -->  Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object.
[11:59:57] <libin> coz i have already got the json in the browser.. all i just need is to get that value of the recieved json
[12:00:08] <libin> ohh sorry my bad
[12:00:09] <ernston> hi
[12:00:22] <ph88> o/
[12:01:09] <libin> can someone suggest a way that i can get the url value from the returned object
[12:01:20] <ernston> \o
[12:04:21] <ph88> libin:   yes .ajax(   setup  request stuff  ).done(function(data){   your data here });
[12:05:05] <libin> that what i wanna know
[12:05:11] <ernston> hi am trying to make a web app, and am using jqtouch the only prob is this uses, zepto.js   and needs  jquery to run
[12:05:19] <libin> how do i pick a value out of that data
[12:05:21] <ernston> i can not get zepto.js and jquery.js working together
[12:05:24] <ph88> libin: i thought you were trying another way ...
[12:05:35] <ph88> libin:   data.key1   data.key2
[12:05:44] <ph88> libin: use your javascript console in your browser
[12:06:00] <libin> can i do that
[12:06:22] <ph88> ctrl + shift + k in firefox    or  ctrl + shift + J  in chrome i thinkk
[12:06:27] <dopie> ugh
[12:06:29] <dopie> anyone help
[12:06:32] <dopie> $50 bucks
[12:06:33] <dopie> :)
[12:06:39] <ph88> dopie: lol :p
[12:06:40] <ph88> sorry man
[12:06:45] <dopie> send with paypal
[12:06:47] <ph88> ernston: afaik zepto has the same functions so maybe try only with jquery
[12:07:09] <ernston> with zepto.js the layout works but no light box
[12:07:21] <ernston> with jquery.js the light box works but no layout css
[12:07:25] <ph88> ernston: try without zepto, only jquery
[12:07:30] <ernston> tried that
[12:07:41] <ernston> jquery only = light box work but the layout breaks
[12:07:51] <ernston> its like zepto calls a stylesheet
[12:08:49] <ernston> would you have a lightbox on a photo gallery on a mobile web app?
[12:08:57] <ernston> thats what i am trying to achieve
[12:12:33] <ph88> ernston: does zepto use $ too ?
[12:12:35] <ernston> without zepto.js the 5 page app is reduced to a long page
[12:12:52] <ernston> it says its similiar to jquery api
[12:13:03] <ernston> and that i should replace zepto with jquery but that does not work
[12:13:10] <ernston> the entire frame breaks
[12:13:20] <ernston> nav , layout, css
[12:13:23] <ph88> yeah very weird ... i though it was compatible too
[12:13:34] <ph88> maybe you can do something with this  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[12:14:25] <ph88> ernston: http://stackoverflow.com/a/14210960
[12:15:26] <ernston> thx let me have a read
[12:16:28] <ph88> i think its better to use zepto Or jquery ... not both ... so if you have chance to fix it later go for that :p
[12:18:05] <ernston> let me re think this
[12:18:19] <ernston> on pages of my app i have a photo gallery, i was going to have a lightbox view
[12:18:31] <ernston> is this wise for a mobile web app?
[12:19:13] <ernston> it sounds ok to me and logical
[12:20:51] <ernston> if so then am trying to make a lightbox with jqtouch
[12:21:07] <ernston> not even sure if that is possible, cant find any examples
[12:21:21] <ernston> with zepto and NOT jquery
[12:21:26] <ph88> i never did a mobile app ...
[12:22:27] <ernston> starting to wish i never tried now
[12:22:34] <ionico> hi,  i have many divs,  inside an input and a checkbox,  how can i sum all the inputs on wich the checkbox is checked??
[12:25:45] <church_> ionico: #checkbox input
[12:26:12] <church_> #checkbox-Id input
[12:27:32] <church_> any know if jqueryui datepicker has a "onOpen" or similar option. I am checking the api but the closes one is onSelect which will not work in this case
[12:27:56] <ph88> ernston: do you use foundation ?
[12:28:08] <ph88> ionico: what do you mean sum ?
[12:28:19] <libin> i still have no luck
[12:28:20] <church_> beforeShow(); ..
[12:28:45] <ph88> Yo Guys ... show code !!
[12:28:54] <ph88> jsfiddle.net  go go go
[12:30:31] <libin> here is my code http://textdump.net/read/2457/
[12:33:14] <ph88> libin:  did you read the documentation on getJSON ?
[12:35:24] <libin> yes i did
[12:35:30] <libin> but did not do much help
[12:36:00] <ph88> the second argument is data you send to the server
[12:36:11] <ph88> in your code you put a function there ...
[12:38:29] <LaMakina> libin
[12:38:35] <LaMakina> what do you want to retrieve ?
[12:38:52] <libin> dzi url
[12:39:32] <LaMakina> http://jsfiddle.net/XKSD8/1/
[12:39:41] <LaMakina> that ?
[12:40:05] <ernston> foundation ? what is that?
[12:40:41] <ph88> ernston: http://foundation.zurb.com/
[12:40:57] <ph88> good for mobile devices
[12:41:32] <church_> checking out my friends code and come along this comment
[12:41:35] <church_> "// Geez the amount of code just to make the font clean. I really hope someone actually notices how smooth this fonts are. These are Sade smooth."
[12:41:40] <church_> lol
[12:41:42] <ernston> this is instead of using jqtouch ?
[12:41:58] <libin> mot that url
[12:43:14] <libin> this is the output that i need : http:\/\/cache.zoom.it\/content\/TrDg.dzi
[12:43:37] <church_> that is one heck of a uri
[12:43:49] <ph88> ernston: i don't know ... check out hammer.js too by the way ...
[12:44:30] <libin> LaMakina : this is the output that i am after : http:\/\/cache.zoom.it\/content\/TrDg.dzi
[12:44:57] <libin> it is towards the end of the object: dzi
[12:47:45] <libin> LaMakina ph88 : thanks heaps for ur help.. Finally i got it working
[12:47:55] <ph88> :)
[12:48:47] <LaMakina> when i doubt just console.log the data object
[12:49:13] <LaMakina> in*
[12:49:38] <libin> thanks. was not really sure how the structure works to retrieve it
[12:49:45] <libin> but finally got my head around it
[12:50:46] <ernston> this zepato is shite
[12:51:03] <ernston> the examples i find say you can replace jquery with zepato.js , but it does not work
[12:51:14] <ernston> even tried a newer version of zepato.js
[12:51:30] <LaMakina> zepto ?
[12:53:04] <ernston> its jqtouch's default lib
[12:53:16] <ernston> it has a nice layout for mobile app
[12:56:59] <ph88> what kind of mobile app are you making ?
[12:57:02] <LaMakina> yeah zepto, i thought you were referring to zepato.
[12:58:08] <LaMakina> ph88: do you have more frameworks/libs to look at. the last couple links were interesting.
[12:58:57] <ph88> LaMakina:  yes here knock yourself out  https://github.com/languages/JavaScript/most_watched
[12:59:28] <LaMakina> thanks
[12:59:40] <SporkSpork> Hi All. I built a new feature for an existing website. My code works properly when I reference jquery-1.9.1.min.js, and I just found out that the existing website references 1.4.4. Is there any way to run one piece of code with one version of jquery and another piece of code with another, all in the same document?
[13:01:23] <ph88> SporkSpork: do you think the old code use functionality that is depreciated in jquery 1.9.1 ?
[13:01:38] <SporkSpork> ph88: It does, unfortunately. I tried.
[13:02:50] <ph88> :(
[13:02:57] <ph88> checkout jQuery noConflict then
[13:03:02] <ph88> but better to upgrade the old code
[13:03:24] <SporkSpork> ph88: It contains a multi-image slideshow. When I reference jquery 1.9.1, the slideshow breaks and each image of the slideshow is below the previous photo scrolling down the page.
[13:04:00] <ph88> SporkSpork: you can but a new slideshow in it   ... maybe nivo slider ...
[13:04:44] <SporkSpork> ph88: that's true. Thanks. I'll look into it, as well as noConflict.
[13:06:41] <Misiur> Hello. Is http://jsfiddle.net/2u83p/ equivalent to a.toggle(), or there are more element states?
[13:08:29] <ph88> well if you run those two lines after each other effectively they will cancel out each other ^^
[13:09:37] <ph88> btw i dont know the :hidden and : visible selectors ... it's display: none  vs display: ''
[13:18:53] <Misiur> ph88: oh, I forgot that the other one is elseif. Also it's more than just display - visibility and opacity as well
[13:19:35] <ph88> oh ye true
[13:19:59] <MikeyD> I have some jquery running on a page. I also have ads that run via javascript. Some of the ads seem to randomly break my jquery. Any recommendations on figuring this out? Removing the ads is not an option
[13:21:32] <Misiur> MikeyD: Changing scope of your application to single closure, not the global one?
[13:22:31] <MikeyD> Misiur: this is one of my js files that breaks and doesnt load at all sometimes: http://jsfiddle.net/RXX3r/
[13:23:18] <MikeyD> how would i change that to global?
[13:23:22] <MikeyD> err, change to single?
[13:25:21] <Misiur> MikeyD: I thought you have problem with namespace, but it looks like there is some more complex problem with files not loading. btw: a little simplified code of yours http://jsfiddle.net/RXX3r/1/
[13:27:17] <MikeyD> Oh nice. So..when you add in the var animategrid, is that creating a closure for the whole thing?
[13:29:06] <SporkSpork> ph88: Much simpler solution. The existing code was an open-source project and it's since been updated. One new file fixed it! phew.
[13:29:17] <ph88> :D
[13:30:04] <Misiur> MikeyD: No, sorry, this won't fix your problems, I just refactored code a little (so you can use $ variable without conflict, and you don't have to write jQuery every single time)
[13:30:49] <MikeyD> ohh ok. Yea, it looks WAY cleaner, thank you
[13:32:52] <PhaseCode> Hey guys, I'm trying to set the clone dropdown value based on a table value see@: http://jsfiddle.net/PhUcU/2/ can anyone please help me I've been stuck for two days now ):
[13:33:32] <MikeyD> Misiur: I am reading up on this: http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/understanding-javascript-closures/ Going to try and get it going in a bit
[13:39:42] <PhaseCode> anyone?
[13:40:02] <ph88> ya im looking at it
[13:40:04] <ph88> what do you want ?
[13:40:26] <ph88> the dropdown options in the table ?
[13:40:44] <ph88> or the table as dropdown options ?
[13:44:08] <PhaseCode> ph88: When you click the
[13:44:55] <PhaseCode> button its supposed to clone the dropdown, set the value of the cloned dropdown to the value in the cell, and replace the cell with the cloned dropdown
[13:45:03] <PhaseCode> does that explain it?
[13:45:35] <ph88> no
[13:45:41] <ph88> do you want dropdown boxes in table cells ?
[13:46:41] <PhaseCode> yes
[13:46:50] <ph88> how would you know in which cell you want to insert the dropdown box ?
[13:47:40] <PhaseCode> All of the cells so row 1 column 1 should have the dropdown cloned and teh "1" selected on the cloned dropdown
[13:48:00] <PhaseCode> row 2 cloumn 1 should have the dropdown cloned and the "2" selected on the cloned dropdown
[13:48:06] <ph88> ooh
[13:48:09] <ph88> and then final too
[13:48:22] <PhaseCode> yea
[13:48:27] <PhaseCode> if it worked right it should look like : http://puu.sh/3wADx.png
[13:48:34] <ph88> so it doesn't matter which value is selected on the dropdown  ?
[13:49:02] <PhaseCode> In the cell or the top dropdown?
[13:49:11] <ph88> top dropdown
[13:49:15] <PhaseCode> no
[13:49:20] <ph88> ah ok
[13:49:40] <PhaseCode> Thank you for being so patent and helping me :)
[13:51:36] <ph88> np
[13:51:40] <ph88> you have a problem though
[13:51:45] <ph88> your drop down has an id
[13:51:49] <ph88> so you if you copy that it's not valid html
[13:52:45] <PhaseCode> Well the dropdowns are going to be removed shorly after, it's just used to edit the table
[14:05:03] <ph88> yey i got it
[14:05:35] <PhaseCode> really/
[14:05:43] <ph88> ye
[14:05:54] <ph88> there is only a small bug ... but it works anyway
[14:06:35] <PhaseCode> can I see?
[14:06:43] <ph88> well it's not finished ...
[14:06:58] <ph88> but ok here it is  http://jsfiddle.net/nXP3F/
[14:07:41] <ph88> ah here, without bug http://jsfiddle.net/nXP3F/1/
[14:07:42] <ph88> :D
[14:09:01] <PhaseCode> give me 10 mins to switch computers here
[14:09:04] <shoky> didn't he want the selected option to be based on the text in the cell?
[14:09:22] <ph88> better markup http://jsfiddle.net/nXP3F/2/
[14:09:30] <PhaseCode> yea, it was just supposed to replace the cell with a dropdown
[14:09:30] <PhaseCode> ;;
[14:09:42] <ph88> ye well you had 3 dummy cells ...
[14:09:46] <ph88> so i figured they didnt matter
[14:10:04] <PhaseCode> no those cells were supposed to be the selected option
[14:10:09] <ph88> oh
[14:10:24] <ph88> so the order could then vary ...
[14:10:31] <ph88> K
[14:13:27] <shoky> PhaseCode: http://jsfiddle.net/PhUcU/3/
[14:13:58] <ph88> hey hey hey, i was almost there !
[14:14:33] <ph88> http://jsfiddle.net/YPtFX/
[14:14:33] <shoky> o sorry..
[14:14:34] <ph88> THERE
[14:14:39] <ph88> bleh bleh bleh
[14:17:37] <shoky> yours clones the selects multiple times
[14:17:42] <shoky> or rather, clones all selects
[14:18:03] <ph88> so i've noticed
[14:20:56] <ph88> well it's no fun now anymore anywa :(
[14:21:35] <shoky> why?
[14:23:08] <ph88> you solved it
[14:23:16] <ph88> btw how to do a shallow clone ?
[14:23:48] <ph88> oh wait
[14:24:08] <ph88> nvm :P
[14:26:23] <ph88> shoky: are you working on something cool ?
[14:31:19] <shoky> ph88: not really. fixing misc bugs in a lame & clunky webapp
[14:31:35] <ph88> lolz :p
[14:31:37] <ph88> painful :D
[14:31:46] <ph88> i bet you made some cool stuff though, you are good
[14:32:56] <shoky> some, yeah. but mostly i work on this lame outdated shit :(
[14:35:30] <ph88> when are you done ?
[14:35:51] <shoky> when i quit ;D
[14:47:11] <ph88> i'll put that on your grave stone ;)

[15:43:58] <ernston> anyone here?
[15:45:56] <raj`> always
[15:47:36] <ernston> anyone ran into an issue with making a web app with jquery mobile ?
[15:47:43] <raj> banister_: $('#div1').scrollTop($('#div1')[0].scrollHeight); according to SO
[15:47:57] <ernston> after creating a basic page i now find out safari 3.2.2 does not support jquery mobile
[15:48:17] <ernston> wont this cause any mobile devices with safari 3.2.2 to fuck up ?
[15:48:31] <raj> probably
[15:48:40] <raj> have you tried opening the page?
[15:49:02] <raj> http://scottwb.com/blog/2012/06/29/jquery-mobile-breaks-your-hrefs-on-ios-mobile-safari/
[15:49:04] <ernston> in safari browser yeah
[15:49:27] <ernston> the pages breaks
[15:49:32] <ernston> and gives me 1 long page
[15:50:03] <ernston> thx reading now
[15:50:04] <raj> ernston, http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/
[15:50:26] <ernston> what mobile devices do you own raj ?
[15:50:45] <raj> android
[15:51:01] <ernston> what version ?
[15:51:12] <ernston> i only have an ipod touch, a old thing
[15:51:35] <raj> sorry, that's personal
[15:51:45] <ernston> lol
[15:51:48] <slopjong> since there's off-topic anyway I ask my off-topic question as well ^^
[15:51:54] <slopjong> can somebody have a look at pastie.org/8116687
[15:52:00] <slopjong> the collision detection doesn't work
[15:52:17] <raj> slopjong, jsfiddle
[15:53:14] <Foxwell> Hey has anyone ever tried making sprite animations with a fixed position? My navigation on the site I'm building has a fixed pos and the sprites I'm throwing in are just there to kind of pretty it up. It works fine in Firefox and Chrome, but in IE (tested in 8 & 9) the animation lags when using the scrollbar. (This is css sprite animation btw, all on one spritesheet.)
[15:54:33] <slopjong> raj, http://jsfiddle.net/YSqKX/
[15:55:31] <Foxwell> Oh and obviously jquery is driving the animation, but I've confirmed that the lag has something to do with it's position. It only lags when the div containing the spritesheet is in a fixed po.
[16:02:17] <raj> slopjong, where did you read you can do it like that?
[16:02:43] <slopjong> raj, http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[16:03:29] <slopjong> the dialog uses the position plugin for the collision detection, everything works, 'my', 'at', etc. except the within option
[16:03:36] <Foxwell> any thoughts at all? I'm sure it's nothing too complicated. The sprites only lag in IE after all.
[16:05:22] <raj> slopjong, http://api.jqueryui.com/position/
[16:06:20] <slopjong> raj, that's where I have the options from ...
[16:07:49] <shoky> slopjong: it's working fine in the fiddle
[16:08:10] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/emilhem/rymEh/33/
[16:08:20] <raj> from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6315262/keep-a-jquery-dialog-in-a-div shows it working
[16:08:40] <raj> try adding the my:'center', at:'center' stuff
[16:11:39] <slopjong> raj, that's not the problem, I've already tried all that, the documentation also says that center is default
[16:11:58] <slopjong> but thanks for the fiddle, I'm looking close at it
[16:12:12] <shoky> slopjong: it's working fine in the fiddle. try running the fiddle without the "within" thing
[16:12:46] <shoky> raj's fiddle is about containment, not position
[16:18:57] <slopjong> shoky, the containment is what i was looking for, but then I don't understand the "within"
[16:19:12] <slopjong> the doc says "Element to position within, affecting collision detection. If you provide a selector or jQuery object, the first matching element will be used."
[16:19:15] <Foxwell> Do you guys know a way to limit what is and isn't scrollable on a page, without making the contents position Fixed.
[16:19:20] <Foxwell> Fixed?*
[16:19:28] <shoky> slopjong: position is a one-time thing. it's positioned, and then it's forgotten about
[16:19:49] <shoky> slopjong: like i said, try removing that "within" from your fiddle and see the difference
[16:21:14] <shoky> (you'll see the difference if the viewport height is not too narrow)
[16:21:19] <shoky> er i mean width
[16:21:56] <slopjong> shoky, that's what I had first, without the within, and that wasn't working, after adding using .draggable({containment: "#test", ...}) it worked fine
[16:23:16] <shoky> i only said to remove the "within" to see the difference, not cause it's what you're looking for
[16:34:32] <Foxwell> Hey hypothetical question. By default the entire body of a page is scrollable, can that be changed so that only a div within a page is scrollable?
[16:48:31] <scriptThis> How would you select this class that has spaces in it? <a class="e f g" href="#">
[16:51:06] <Auger> scriptThis: classes can't have spaces in them, those are 3 separate classes
[16:51:44] <Auger> but if you wanted to select an element that had all three of those classes you would do $('.e.f.g');
[17:03:04] <fesener_> hi everyone, if I have "<input type="text" name="msg">" isnt this what should I do to detect if enter pressed:    $('#msg').keypress(function(e) {
[17:03:04] <fesener_>       if (e.keyCode == 13) { ... }
[17:03:42] <fesener_> what's wrong with this code can anybody help me
[17:07:00] <shoky> fesener_:  #msg  looks for id="msg"
[17:08:08] <fesener_> shoky, i've also added id="msg"
[17:08:10] <fesener_> still doesnt work
[17:08:45] <fesener_> <input type="text" name="msg" id="msg"> and $('#msg').keypress(function(e) { ... } right now
[17:08:49] <fesener_> still doesnt respond
[17:09:38] <shoky> fesener_: seems fine to me  http://jsfiddle.net/VW5T8/
[17:10:19] <fesener_> hmm
[17:10:27] <fesener_> yes this example does work
[17:10:41] <shoky> did you put your code in DOM-ready handler?
[17:12:15] <Fraz> i didnt know jquery had keycodes
[17:12:21] <Fraz> that will be useful
[17:12:23] <fesener_> shoky, what does that mean
[17:12:32] <Fraz> i always checked the character manually
[17:12:38] <shoky> fesener_:  $(document).ready(function() { ... })
[17:13:00] <fesener_> i dont think so
[17:13:08] <fesener_> here's my code http://pastebin.com/PSa5ABUU shoky
[17:13:43] <shoky> fesener_:  that  $(function() { ... })   is also a dom-ready handler , put the keypress thing in tthere
[17:14:02] <fesener_> before var iosocket = ...
[17:14:04] <Fraz> wrap it in what shoky said, and make sure you script source variable is correct
[17:14:05] <fesener_> right ?
[17:14:12] <shoky> that'd work
[17:14:34] <shoky> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[17:14:41] <Fraz> {% block page_title %} Test Sayfası {% endblock page_title %} << what kind of code is this?
[17:14:52] <fesener_> Fraz, Django template
[17:14:57] <Fraz> ah
[17:15:01] <fesener_> shoky, thank you very much it works now
[17:15:06] <Fraz> i hate template scripts
[17:15:09] <fesener_> i'll just go take lessons on try.jquery.com
[17:15:11] <Fraz> thats why i love wordpress:D
[17:15:17] <fesener_> it seems i DO need those basics
[17:15:31] <fesener_> fraz those 2 are complete different things tho :P its ok
[17:16:00] <Fraz> yeah. i hate when people say "you shouldnt use php in the front end"
[17:16:03] <Fraz> i just say, go away
[17:16:36] <shoky> o.O
[17:16:39] <fesener_> i was saying that before i tried django too
[17:16:41] <fesener_> :P
[17:16:48] <Fraz> ill say it forever
[17:17:00] <fesener_> well its up to you
[17:17:03] <fesener_> :)
[17:17:04] <Fraz> theres nothing wrong with using php in the front end
[17:17:16] <fesener_> well its like trying to code a program with assembly
[17:17:16] <Fraz> ive heard people say its a security risk....err how
[17:17:29] <Fraz> what is?
[17:17:30] <fesener_> and a way shitty assembly
[17:17:37] <Fraz> php?
[17:17:43] <fesener_> trying to code with php while you can use RoR or django etc.
[17:17:52] <fesener_> but its a choice nonetheless
[17:18:02] <Fraz> ive had a go at drupal and joomla. and i cant stand that templating system
[17:18:14] <Fraz> i just wanted to use php, but it wouldnt let me
[17:18:33] <fesener_> then our needs are completely different :) you are not talking about coding with php you are talking about using php scripts to create a website
[17:19:23] <Fraz> uh?
[17:20:21] <fesener_> nevermind :P im off to jquery lessons, have a good day
[17:20:33] <Fraz> yootoo
[17:21:31] <rafa_01> I am switching from many years of prototype onto jquery, looking for some good tips if anyone can help
[17:22:28] <shoky> rafa_01: if you have a specific question/issue, ask away
[17:22:28] <rafa_01> good tutorials / excercises would be great! thanks
[17:22:46] <shoky> rafa_01: http://jqfundamentals.com
[17:23:10] <rafa_01> sure. so I wanted a good tutorial, something with ajax calls where I can get used to the syntax as I work out problems
[17:23:58] <shoky> that one has ajax too
[17:23:59] <rafa_01> alright, yeah that looks pretty good thanks. If you have anything else please send it over!
[17:26:36] <ernston> has anyone else solved the jquery mobile , safari issue?
[17:26:51] <Pavlov> yes
[17:26:58] <Pavlov> er
[17:26:59] <Pavlov> nevermind
[17:27:02] <boytoy> ernston: which one?
[17:27:10] <ernston> safari 3.2.2
[17:27:16] <boytoy> no which issue?
[17:27:26] <ernston> oh
[17:27:29] <ernston> the pages dont work
[17:27:39] <ernston> in chrome it a multipage site
[17:27:49] <ernston> in safari its 1 page with styling stripped
[17:28:46] <ernston> am using jquery mobile to create an app
[17:36:07] <ionico> how can i reach the value of an input when the checkbox is checked??
[17:36:08] <endra> Hey, is there a performance hit every time I do select with $("foobar")? If in some set of code I want to touch $("foobar") numerous times, is it better to do var foobar = $("foobar") and operate on foobar?
[17:36:20] <ionico> is it posible?
[17:38:36] <endra> ionico: try $(selector).val(). http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4243554/if-checkbox-is-checked-do-this
[17:44:08] <rafa_01> I have a question regarding $, should it just work right off the bat with jQuery (provided there is no other library conflicting with it of course). When I include the jQuery library, I have never been able to get $ to work, so I just write $j =jQuery
[17:44:23] <rafa_01> am I missing something, or does it have to be done manually
[17:44:39] <rafa_01> like $ = window.jQuery
[17:48:30] <rafa_01> dang no answers, now I feel like I just asked a really dumb question :( but regardless, is it a problem with my setup then?
[17:48:37] <shoky> rafa_01: if no other library is conflicting with it, and you're not calling jQuery.noConflict() anywhere, then $ should work
[17:49:58] <shoky> and regardless of that, you can always have $ be jQuery if you put this around your code:  (function($) { ... })(jQuery)
[17:51:48] <rafa_01> hm I see, yeah that's what the book I was reading made it sound like, but then I had started a raw excercise on a clean directory running apache but with no other js libs included. Cool I see, so I could use that anonymous function if all fails. Calling jquery.NoConflict() also did the trick, wehn assigned to a var. Alright thanks
[17:52:09] <shoky> endra: yes it's better to cache the selections
[17:52:17] <Robr3rd> I have a PHP-based site that loads a "master index page" which references jquery, and then content pages which may or may not make use of it. For some reason, there are certain jquery-based things that only work if they are included in the content page, regardless of the "master page". Why might that be?
[17:52:21] <endra> shoky: thanks
[17:55:22] <Fraz> <Robr3rd> is this wordpress by any chance?
[18:07:16] <Robr3rd> Fraz: No, just pure PHP
[18:10:28] <Fraz> well im not sure what you mean by a master page and a content page?
[18:10:41] <boytoy> At http://jsbin.com/olequh/4/edit -- once I hit "Close", the banner should not show up on subsequent reloads. But yet it does. Might somebody be able to spot the bug? (uses the jquery-cookie plugin)
[18:12:01] <Robr3rd> Fraz: I've got the main index.php of the site. There is a <div> for content, and it dynamically includes the appropriate file for the content of the page. That's on the PHP side. INside the page, I have <script src="jquery.js"></script> to grab jQuery.
[18:12:31] <Robr3rd> Now, what this means is that jQuery is included in every page on the site that is included through index.php (which is all of them). Yet, I have to include it twice on the page to get it to work
[18:16:42] <Fraz> got a link?
[18:20:54] <rafa_01> boytoy: I was thinking it was something with the value of expire, but didn't work. Tough bug, hope someone gets it for you
[18:21:10] <boytoy> oh that was you :D
[18:21:19] <boytoy> hehe thanks man!
[18:21:51] <rafa_01> yeah lol, well I didn''t know about jsbin, love it I will be using it
[18:23:03] <rafa_01> no worries when I get better at jquery hopefully I will be able to help out some more. later!
[18:23:48] <boytoy> one love peace
[18:25:00] <Robr3rd> Fraz: No, this is on localhost
[18:25:39] <Fraz> have you checked page output, can you verify the script is actually included twice on the pages you mentioned?
[18:29:17] <Robr3rd> Yep, absolutely certain.
[18:31:09] <scriptThis> If I have a table Im matching by $('.foo.bar'), how do I get the value of a <td> within the 3rd row of that table?
[18:41:07] <scriptThis> Can you "split" out the results of a .html() chain?
[18:41:32] <scriptThis> like .html()[0] .html()[1] to get each 'tag" out?
[18:44:38] <CiE|Work> sup guys i'm having an issue with the select2 plugin pulling from json anyone able to assist?
[19:03:01] <Fraz> why would any client refuse the use of jquery for his website?:S
[19:03:45] <Fraz> im discussing a job atm, and the client says "no jquery, just javascript"
[19:06:09] <boytoy> Fraz: prolly cuz it's like 100 times faster :p
[19:46:01] <RonWhoCares> I set up some jQuery AJAX.  Is there a way for jQuery to empty the results DIV after 5 seconds
[19:47:30] <systemfault> Just use setTimeout?
[20:02:57] <RonWhoCares> Got it
[20:03:56] <realazthat> hi, how do I setup an event-handler to the body-element that gets destroyed when my widget is destroyed?
[20:04:25] <realazthat> for example, I want to have a context menu on a particular widget, and a click event anywhere not on that widget should close the menu
[20:04:33] <RonWhoCares> systemfault: I found this command.   var fade_out = function() {   $("#portal_link_rating_response").fadeOut().empty(); } setTimeout(fade_out, 10000);    I expect the empty() is preventing me from posting to the results dav a second time.  Is there another command I should be adding to this sequence?
[20:05:12] <RonWhoCares> (I mean the next jQuery AJAX result doesn't display, even though I see it in the Console as a result
[20:22:25] <wad> I need to handle an even when a certain tab is clicked, to populate the data in that tab. It's just for one tab. In the event handler, how do I tell which tab is about to show up? http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-beforeActivate
[20:22:31] <wad> s/even/event/
[20:23:00] <wad> Oh, wait. I see it.
[20:23:05] * wad must be blind!
[20:56:00] <axsuul> Why is it that when I'm doing  console.log($('body'))… I'm getting x.fn.x.init[1]  ?
[20:56:51] <shoky> axsuul: that's one way of how a jquery object looks like
[20:57:23] <shoky> axsuul:  do console.log( $('body').get() )  if you wanna see it as an array of elements
[21:02:32] <RonWhoCares> shoky: After this runs   $("#portal_link_rating_response").fadeOut();   when I post to the DIV in the net jQuery AJAX nothing displays.  Why needs to change?
[21:02:54] <shoky> RonWhoCares: i donno what you're talking about
[21:04:10] <shoky> RonWhoCares: though, why would you expect anythign to display if it's faded out
[21:05:13] <RonWhoCares> shoky: I made this jsfidle for you to e  http://jsfiddle.net/xjWX5/
[21:06:36] <RonWhoCares> shoky it displays the confirmation message for 10 seconds
[21:06:38] <shoky> RonWhoCares: i still donno what you're talking about
[21:07:21] <shoky> RonWhoCares: your setTimeout there fades it out 10 seconds after page has loaded
[21:07:45] <RonWhoCares> Shoky: This is part of a jQuery AJAX
[21:08:21] <shoky> wtf is "a jQuery AJAX"
[21:08:49] <shoky> and what are you talking about, and you haven't answered my question
[21:09:09] <RonWhoCares> The fading occurs once the radio button has been clicked    $('#portal_link_rate_container').on('click', '.overall_impression', function() {
[21:09:34] <shoky> no, it occurs 10 seconds after page load. since you put a setTimeout for 10 seconds
[21:09:44] <shoky> i have no idea what you want
[21:10:07] <RonWhoCares> I want to be able to post to the results DIV #portal_link_rating_response multiple times
[21:10:30] <shoky> ok?
[21:10:48] <RonWhoCares> But once the ' Fade ' command runs it won't display the new result confirmation message again
[21:11:05] <shoky> because you faded it out.. so it's hidden
[21:12:03] <RonWhoCares> Is there a way to reverse this?
[21:12:09] <RonWhoCares> so I can use it a second time?
[21:12:30] <shoky> .fadeIn() ..?
[21:12:32] <shoky> .show() ?
[21:12:33] <shoky> etc.
[21:13:15] <RonWhoCares> ok
[21:15:24] <RonWhoCares> Adding the ' show ' doesn't allow the DIV to display again    var fade_out = function() {     $("#portal_link_rating_response").fadeOut();     $("#portal_link_rating_response").show();   }
[21:16:38] <Pavlov> i think you want just fadeIn
[21:17:16] <Pavlov> oh, nevermind, i don't actually understand what you want
[21:18:18] <RonWhoCares> I want to remove the confirmation message after 10 seconds
[21:18:30] <RonWhoCares> fadeOut leaves the DIV hidden
[21:18:36] <Pavlov> right
[21:18:52] <Pavlov> so you want to remove it, but not hide it?
[21:18:54] <Pavlov> i don't understand
[21:19:04] <RonWhoCares> You got it --- I want to remove it, but not hide it
[21:19:12] <Pavlov> what does "remove it" mean?
[21:19:24] <Pavlov> like, you want to delete it from the dom?
[21:19:32] <Pavlov> you want to make it empty?
[21:19:35] <Pavlov> you want to hide it?
[21:19:44] <RonWhoCares> I want to empty it
[21:19:49] <RonWhoCares> after 10 seconds passes
[21:20:03] <RonWhoCares> so the DIV is available for use again
[21:21:31] <Pavlov> so why not do $("#portal_link_rating_response").fadeOut().empty() ?
[21:22:18] <Pavlov> and then use fadeIn to show it again whenever you want
[21:22:27] <Pavlov> along with whatever code adds things to the div
[21:23:12] <RonWhoCares> Thank you
[21:23:24] <RonWhoCares> Adding fadeIn() was the missing clue
[21:23:32] <RonWhoCares> $("#portal_link_rating_response").fadeOut().empty().fadeIn();
[21:23:49] <Pavlov> i still don't understand why you would fade it in there
[21:23:53] <Pavlov> and not when you add content to it
[21:29:49] <RonWhoCares> ok
[21:30:20] <RonWhoCares> I could put the ' fadeIn ' as part of script which processes the radio buttons being clicked
[21:30:47] <dopie> hey guys
[21:30:50] <dopie> i get this error
[21:30:51] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/5942312
[21:37:10] <ionico> i have many divs,  each one with hidden input and a checkbox,  how can i set the hidden input value = checkbox value when is checked,  so i can pass unchecked values???
[21:52:12] <axsuul> shoky: how comes its different when I run the same thing in console
[21:52:53] <Ansikt> ionico: jQuery('.someDiv').on('click','function(){document.getElementById('someCheckboxId').checked = !document.getElementById('someCheckboxId').checked});
[22:43:17] <akurilin2> When doing xhr with jQuery, is it normal that the status of the xhr object returned in case of failure is 404 when the underlying http code is 403?
[22:47:12] <fesener_> is it possible to make a single loop to iterate this data: {"test":{"socketid":"ACZxlrcS8YeqHZKnndsG","userid":"3"},"ruless":{"socketid":"qjzftQUJXq0oOC5gndsO","userid":"2"}}
[22:48:50] <abjorn> fesener_, what are you trying to do
[22:49:13] <fesener_> abjorn, just trying to reach those values
[22:49:49] <abjorn> i mean, sure
[22:50:19] <abjorn> for (var thing in data) { /* do something with thing.socketid */ }
[22:50:36] <abjorn> *data[thing].docketid
[22:50:42] <abjorn> socketid, even
[22:50:44] <abjorn> cant type
[22:50:45] <fesener_> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '114' in {"test":{"socketid":"ACZxlrcS8YeqHZKnndsG","userid":"3"},"ruless":{"socketid":"qjzftQUJXq0oOC5gndsO","userid":"2"}}
[22:51:02] <fesener_> i've got this everytime so far
[22:51:22] <abjorn> uh...are you just straight up putting that object literal in there?
[22:51:33] <fesener_> hm ?
[22:51:41] <fesener_> didnt understand sorry
[22:51:51] <abjorn> create a paste or something so i can see what youre doing
[22:51:56] <fesener_> ok
[22:54:57] <fesener_> http://pastebin.com/gTq2q2tA
[22:55:01] <fesener_> thats all abjorn :)
[22:56:19] <fesener_> there's </a><br> etc after mainvalue ofc :p
[22:56:28] <fesener_> forgot to add
[22:56:54] <abjorn> Well I meant I wanted to see your actual JavaScript for the loop
[22:57:53] <fesener_> I have nothing atm to loop
[22:58:04] <fesener_> i've tried a few examples from web and it gave error like I said
[22:58:32] <abjorn> Well I can't really help if I can't see the javascript that is giving an error
[22:59:28] <fesener_> well all I want to have is iterate on that JSON value
[22:59:41] <fesener_> ok i can try again some codes if you want
[23:00:26] <abjorn> Are you doing something like "for (var name in {thing: 'value'})" ?
[23:00:46] <fesener_> i've tried some jquery loops
[23:00:52] <fesener_> let me try again
[23:00:58] <abjorn> although i guess it wouldnt matter if you are...
[23:01:04] <abjorn> anyways, yeah
[23:01:12] <abjorn> gotta see some code :)
[23:05:41] <fesener_> abjorn, this gives error for example http://pastebin.com/h8jEcrhU
[23:06:16] <abjorn> just use a normal for loop, rather than $.each
[23:06:55] <fesener_> would you give me that normal loop code to iterate on this input ?
[23:07:17] <abjorn> http://pastebin.com/k0P6WtPy
[23:07:43] <abjorn> I would suggest getting yourself comfortable with javascript loops
[23:07:52] <abjorn> well, javascript in general, but yeah
[23:08:16] <fesener_> it gives out a wierd output
[23:08:26] <fesener_> do I have to parseJSON this input or something
[23:08:33] <abjorn> no
[23:08:45] <abjorn> what is the output
[23:09:02] <fesener_> http://pastebin.com/jMKNa5Qv
[23:09:21] <fesener_> it iterates on it asif it's a string
[23:09:23] <abjorn> uh
[23:09:25] <abjorn> huh
[23:09:26] <abjorn> thats new
[23:10:27] <greg5green> yes, you have to parse it
[23:10:34] <greg5green> if you want to iterate over its properties
[23:10:50] <fesener_> ok let me try
[23:11:05] <greg5green> abjorn, you dont in the case you gave
[23:11:18] <abjorn> was about to say
[23:11:36] <abjorn> works for me, should only need to do that if youre actually trying to do that with some json data
[23:11:44] <abjorn> rather than an object literal like in that example
[23:11:48] <greg5green> but im pretty sure its actually "{"test":{"socketid":"ACZxlrcS8YeqHZKnndsG","userid":"3"},"ruless":{"socketid":"ViIIwAEbJXVbkZFRndsR","userid":"2"}}" not just {"test":{"socketid":"ACZxlrcS8YeqHZKnndsG","userid":"3"},"ruless":{"socketid":"ViIIwAEbJXVbkZFRndsR","userid":"2"}}
[23:12:15] <greg5green> and that was proven when it iterated through each character
[23:12:20] <abjorn> werd
[23:12:56] <fesener_> ok
[23:13:03] <fesener_> after I did what you told me
[23:13:09] <fesener_>  console.log(name, usersStr[name].userid);
[23:13:11] <fesener_> outputs:
[23:13:19] <fesener_> test 3
[23:13:21] <fesener_> ruless 2
[23:13:26] <fesener_> i guess its ok now :)
[23:13:28] <fesener_> thank you so much
[23:13:33] <fesener_> both of you
[23:13:52] <greg5green> np gl
[23:19:07] <libin_> hello everyone .. i am getting cross origin error , when i call a api provided by zoom.it . can someone please tell how can i fix this issue. Or what am i doing wrong. here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/vHggh/2/
[23:21:36] <libin_> anyone here
[23:22:25] <greg5green> libin_ youd get better luck asking somewhere specific to Seadragon
[23:23:01] <greg5green> but i will add that a lot of browsers dont allow cross domain xhr calls
[23:23:04] <libin_> i know.. bt the support is dead there.. so thought will try my luck here just in case
[23:23:18] <jangoh> how to select all label for that has certain text?
[23:23:31] <greg5green> theres ways to tell some browsers that its cool, but that would be specific to Seadragon
[23:24:06] <greg5green> CORS, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing, is what you would be looking for in Seadragon's documentation
[23:25:02] <greg5green> jangoh, $('label:contains("The content you want to match")
[23:25:16] <greg5green> err, sorry, thats incomplete
[23:25:26] <greg5green> $('label:contains("The content you want to match')')
[23:25:36] <greg5green> and sheesh, i cant type sometimes
[23:25:43] <jangoh> ok thanx
[23:25:47] <greg5green> ONE MORE TRY, $('label:contains("The content you want to match")') :)
[23:27:13] <jangoh>  $('label:contains("DELETE")').css('color','blue');
[23:27:17] <jangoh> is it valid?
[23:27:52] <greg5green> looks right
[23:28:19] <dualcore> i didn't know you could do that, cool
[23:28:26] <jangoh> but "DELETE" is a for attr
[23:28:35] <dualcore> why not just css('color', 'none')
[23:28:59] <jangoh> contain mean text right?
[23:30:05] <greg5green> yes
[23:30:10] <jangoh> Not working
[23:30:12] <greg5green> if you are looking for the for attr
[23:30:20] <greg5green> for whats in the for attr that is
[23:30:29] <greg5green> $('label[for=DELETE]')
[23:31:13] <dualcore> so would that remove the color blue if conditions are met?
[23:31:29] <jangoh> i have this <label for="id_course_name-0-DELETE">Delete:</label>
[23:31:52] <greg5green> ok
[23:32:33] <jangoh> i need match the value of for attr
[23:32:44] <jangoh> or text
[23:32:56] <jangoh> contains also failed
[23:33:12] <greg5green> thats because you looked for DELETE
[23:33:13] <greg5green> not Delete
[23:33:26] <jangoh>  $('label:contains("Delete")').css('color','blue');
[23:33:37] <jangoh> should work right?
[23:33:37] <greg5green> yes
[23:33:54] <dualcore> nvm
[23:34:04] <greg5green> or you could do
[23:34:16] <greg5green> $('label[for*=DELETE]')
[23:34:34] <greg5green> dualcore, that would add that property, not remove it
[23:34:52] <dualcore> indeed i see that now
[23:34:54] <greg5green> contains looks for 'Delete' in the displayed text
[23:35:00] <jangoh> not working
[23:35:04] <jangoh> dont know why
[23:35:22] <greg5green> *=DELETE looks for DELETE to appear within the for attribute
[23:35:52] <dualcore> i wonder what the main objective is
[23:36:14] <dualcore> why are you trying to select something that has "Delete" in the first place?
[23:36:53] <jangoh> dualcore
[23:36:57] <jangoh> i have this <label for="id_course_name-0-DELETE">Delete:</label>
[23:37:12] <jangoh> How do i change the label color
[23:37:17] <jangoh> text color i mean
[23:37:22] <greg5green> did your console spit out any errors?
[23:37:53] <dualcore> i would probably add a class and select it that way instead
[23:38:25] <dualcore> <label class="deletething"
[23:38:37] <dualcore> $('.deletething')
[23:38:50] <greg5green> I probably would too
[23:38:57] <jangoh> dualcore its generating by framwork templates
[23:39:06] <jangoh> i cant modify it
[23:39:13] <jangoh> framework*
[23:39:30] <jangoh> Talking about Django
[23:39:39] <greg5green> why cant you edit your templates?
[23:39:46] <greg5green> Django templates are pretty easy
[23:39:47] <greg5green> :)
[23:39:59] <jangoh> Its coming from django form
[23:40:18] <jangoh> form genertaing this auto
[23:40:33] <greg5green> btw
[23:40:37] <greg5green> there is an error on your end
[23:40:39] <greg5green> i just checked
[23:40:42] <greg5green> $('label:contains("Delete")').css('color', 'blue');
[23:40:45] <greg5green> does work
[23:40:50] <greg5green> http://jsfiddle.net/8YM8X/
[23:41:26] <greg5green> as does $('label[for*=DELETE]').css('color', 'blue'); http://jsfiddle.net/8YM8X/1/
[23:41:28] <jangoh> hm
[23:41:30] <dualcore> i'm sure there is a way to select that, and i am not familiar with django, but perhaps looking into developing django templates would end up saving you more javascript headaches
[23:41:51] <greg5green> i agree dualcore
[23:44:29] <dualcore> ideally you would just select it and change classes
[23:44:59] <greg5green> also a better solution
[23:44:59] <dualcore> instead of just adding a color with jquery
[23:44:59] <greg5green> yup
[23:44:59] <greg5green> will help with maintainability
[23:45:01] <dualcore> then you have your css in one place
[23:46:35] <jangoh> Thanx I will try jquery more
[23:46:51] <jangoh> Editing the base files would be hard
[23:50:56] <dualcore> jangoh: just don't forget to check into .addclass() and .removeclass(), if you want to change more than text color this will be easier
[23:51:49] <dualcore> i use that with .hover() often
[23:52:47] <jangoh> actually i want to align checkboxes with labels
[23:53:06] <jangoh> so testing the jquery to select them
[23:53:20] <dualcore> alignment sounds like css to me :]
[23:53:31] <jangoh> sure
[23:53:40] <jangoh> but i need select them first
[23:53:42] <dualcore> well you gotta select it sure
[23:54:01] <dualcore> but once selected, you could add/remove class instead of using .css
[23:54:19] <dualcore> indeed
[23:54:19] <jangoh> yes
[23:54:30] <dualcore> well i will shut up until you get it selected! :P
[23:54:42] <dualcore> in fact, i will just shut up now
[23:54:45] <jangoh> haha yes i cant select them yet :/
[23:54:47] <dualcore> good night all!
[23:54:52] <greg5green> nigh
[23:55:03] <jangoh> cya
[23:55:25] <dualcore> best of luck
[23:55:28] <dualcore> select that shit
[23:55:32] <jangoh> lol
[23:56:00] <greg5green> jangoh, were you getting errors in the js console?
[23:56:07] <jangoh> <tr><th><label for="id_course_name-0-DELETE">Delete:</label></th><td><input id="id_course_name-0-DELETE" name="course_name-0-DELETE" type="checkbox" />
[23:56:12] <jangoh> no
[23:56:22] <jangoh> dont know why this is notworking
[23:56:49] <greg5green> yar, idk why either
[23:56:49] <greg5green> sorry
[23:57:20] <greg5green> what browser are you developing with?
[23:57:24] <greg5green> what version of jquery?
[23:57:26] <jangoh> <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/jquery-1.3.2.min.js"></script>
[23:57:35] <jangoh> i just checked it
[23:57:40] <greg5green> old, but new enough as :contains was added in 1.1.4
[23:57:48] <jangoh> ya
[23:57:57] <jangoh> I was making sure
[23:58:09] <greg5green> you know how to set breakpoints?
[23:58:26] <greg5green> if so, did you try stepping through it?
[23:58:55] <jangoh> Not good at debugging in console
[23:59:11] <greg5green> in your code
[23:59:32] <greg5green> try doing a console.log($('label:contains("DELETE")'));
[23:59:38] <greg5green> see if it logs out your element
[23:59:58] <greg5green> it'll either have the html in it or be a blank line
